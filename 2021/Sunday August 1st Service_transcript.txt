[0.00 --> 14.62]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[15.62 --> 16.88]  I'm a little loud to me.
[18.14 --> 20.50]  I know we had some technical difficulties online.
[20.60 --> 22.22]  I just want to say sorry that you couldn't hear us.
[22.28 --> 23.94]  Can the people online hear us now, Louis?
[24.20 --> 24.98]  Yeah, there we go.
[26.34 --> 27.06]  That's all right.
[27.06 --> 28.06]  Thank you.
[29.44 --> 31.70]  Well, I see some of our summer camp leaders here.
[31.82 --> 36.50]  I just want to say it's been such a gift to have our summer camp happening over the summer so far.
[36.76 --> 38.96]  And, you know, for two years, it's pretty quiet in this building.
[39.48 --> 41.16]  And then we get to hear kids roaring around.
[41.26 --> 43.52]  And this morning, not just on Sundays, but also during the week.
[43.60 --> 45.10]  And summer camp leaders, I see some of you here.
[45.18 --> 46.36]  You're doing an amazing job.
[46.98 --> 47.82]  You are leading well.
[47.90 --> 49.04]  You're caring for these kids well.
[49.12 --> 49.92]  And we just want to thank you.
[49.92 --> 56.70]  I spotted some of you.
[56.76 --> 57.66]  You're hiding in the back over there.
[57.70 --> 58.30]  We see you.
[60.04 --> 62.04]  We're going to continue our series on the book of Exodus.
[62.48 --> 64.44]  We've been journeying through that over the course of the summer.
[65.00 --> 66.78]  And we're finally getting into the second part.
[66.88 --> 69.62]  The first part of Exodus is all about God's rescue,
[70.44 --> 73.12]  his bringing the slave nation out of oppression.
[73.36 --> 75.88]  And now we're in the part where God brings them to himself.
[76.42 --> 78.44]  And he says, this is why I've done it.
[78.44 --> 81.34]  This is the job I've called you to do as my people.
[81.52 --> 84.66]  And so if you have your Bible, turn with me to Exodus chapter 19.
[85.10 --> 88.64]  We're going to read the job description that God gives to his people Israel.
[99.60 --> 103.42]  On the first day of the third month after the Israelites left Egypt,
[103.92 --> 106.70]  on that very day, they came to the desert of Sinai.
[106.70 --> 110.64]  After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the desert of Sinai,
[110.72 --> 113.34]  and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.
[114.52 --> 118.32]  Then Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain and said,
[118.90 --> 121.26]  This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob,
[121.36 --> 123.52]  and what you are to tell the people of Israel.
[124.28 --> 127.24]  You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt,
[127.66 --> 131.22]  and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
[131.22 --> 135.40]  Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant,
[136.18 --> 139.50]  then out of all the nations you will be my treasured possession.
[140.52 --> 142.94]  Although the whole earth is mine,
[143.82 --> 147.90]  you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
[148.90 --> 151.34]  These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.
[151.34 --> 154.72]  So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people
[154.72 --> 157.76]  and set before them all the words the Lord had commanded him to speak.
[158.36 --> 160.50]  And the people all responded together,
[161.14 --> 164.64]  We will do everything the Lord has said.
[164.98 --> 168.44]  So Moses brought their answer back to the Lord.
[168.44 --> 180.10]  On Wednesday, January 13, 2016,
[181.68 --> 185.08]  an article was written in the Cloverdale Reporter about our church.
[185.66 --> 187.76]  It's getting so old now that the paper is getting yellow.
[188.56 --> 189.58]  Some of you might remember this.
[189.60 --> 192.56]  This is four days before we had our first service in this building.
[193.42 --> 194.94]  And someone from the reporter came,
[195.02 --> 198.42]  and they interviewed Pastor Sid about what the vision we have for this church is.
[198.94 --> 200.64]  What kind of church we want to be in this city,
[200.76 --> 202.88]  and what are our plans for the future of our church?
[203.30 --> 205.94]  And they wrote a fairly kind, hospitable article,
[206.08 --> 206.72]  and even says,
[206.84 --> 210.02]  New church built with community needs in mind.
[210.46 --> 213.18]  And there's a picture of the original 80 of people
[213.18 --> 215.60]  in front of the building on a cold January morning there.
[216.96 --> 218.04]  But when I think of this article,
[218.04 --> 220.76]  I actually have a negative memory associated with it,
[220.82 --> 222.96]  because someone emailed me the online version.
[223.30 --> 224.36]  I read through it to the bottom,
[224.46 --> 226.94]  and there was one comment posted on the bottom of that article.
[227.50 --> 228.28]  One comment.
[228.72 --> 229.78]  You know what that comment was?
[230.86 --> 232.88]  Just what the world doesn't need.
[233.96 --> 236.06]  A private clubhouse for believers.
[236.96 --> 237.36]  End quote.
[238.12 --> 239.92]  And I thought, man, why do you got to write that?
[240.22 --> 241.96]  The bottom of this article about our church.
[242.18 --> 244.50]  It's probably the same person who on our Google reviews,
[244.60 --> 245.82]  if you ever looked at our church on Google,
[246.06 --> 247.42]  the first comment is,
[247.70 --> 249.86]  this church does a terrible job cleaning up the neighborhood.
[250.30 --> 250.84]  So there you go.
[250.88 --> 253.54]  All the negative feedback for everyone to read about our church.
[254.24 --> 255.64]  Jerry Hanlon, don't take that personally.
[255.64 --> 257.50]  Next week, by the way, we have a garbage cleanup.
[257.66 --> 259.74]  You can all join in after the service.
[259.88 --> 260.48]  True story.
[261.58 --> 264.50]  But that comment, a private clubhouse for believers,
[264.60 --> 266.08]  that has stuck with me.
[266.08 --> 268.16]  I always think of that when I see this article.
[269.20 --> 270.12]  And it was harsh.
[271.10 --> 273.96]  It was very, very, it seems a little mean.
[274.46 --> 275.62]  But at the same time, it's honest.
[276.22 --> 277.46]  And if I had to guess, I would say,
[277.54 --> 279.36]  I bet you that person grew up in church.
[280.02 --> 281.46]  I bet you they left the church,
[281.54 --> 283.42]  and I bet you their experience of church was
[283.42 --> 286.42]  a private clubhouse for believers.
[286.42 --> 289.48]  And when I look at this article,
[289.60 --> 291.84]  I often think of it as a challenge.
[292.94 --> 294.98]  Will Hope Community be a new church built
[294.98 --> 296.28]  with community needs in mind?
[296.94 --> 299.78]  Or will it be a private religious community
[299.78 --> 301.28]  that just does its own little thing,
[301.36 --> 303.28]  and on Sunday morning, the Christians gather
[303.28 --> 305.80]  to do their own little religious private thing?
[305.80 --> 311.48]  When God calls Israel in Exodus 19,
[312.06 --> 313.38]  rescues them from slavery,
[313.54 --> 314.66]  brings them to Mount Sinai,
[314.74 --> 316.68]  he has no interest in forming
[316.68 --> 319.24]  a private religious club.
[319.84 --> 322.66]  That is so far from his vision for Israel.
[323.42 --> 324.96]  In fact, what we see right at the beginning
[324.96 --> 326.82]  of this passage is that when he summons them,
[327.34 --> 328.90]  he has a vision for them.
[329.28 --> 330.86]  His job description for them is,
[331.88 --> 335.34]  bring my blessing to the nations.
[336.08 --> 339.72]  Bring my life to the neighbors you live beside.
[340.12 --> 341.70]  That's why I've called you.
[342.28 --> 343.54]  And we're going to see in Exodus 19,
[343.62 --> 345.30]  as we look at it, that they have a job to do.
[345.78 --> 347.94]  They have the privilege of being God's people,
[348.28 --> 349.42]  his treasured possession,
[350.16 --> 353.50]  and the responsibility of bringing his blessing
[353.50 --> 354.34]  to the nations.
[355.84 --> 357.58]  Now, before we look closely at this passage,
[357.66 --> 360.84]  I just want to zoom out again and look at Genesis 12.
[361.06 --> 362.30]  You'll remember, of course,
[362.38 --> 363.72]  you'll remember at the beginning of this series,
[363.72 --> 366.32]  we looked at how Exodus is God making good
[366.32 --> 369.30]  on his promise to Abraham many years ago.
[369.96 --> 372.22]  Abraham, the first person from whom Israel comes,
[372.60 --> 375.18]  God brings to himself, meets him and says,
[375.28 --> 378.96]  Abraham, I've got a plan for you and for your people.
[379.02 --> 381.02]  And I want to read for you what he says to Abraham
[381.02 --> 382.24]  in Genesis 12.
[382.36 --> 383.86]  I don't remember if I put it up on the screen.
[384.04 --> 384.96]  Oh, I do have it on the screen.
[386.22 --> 387.20]  In Genesis 12,
[388.12 --> 389.38]  which I'll read from my own Bible here,
[389.38 --> 390.18]  if I can find it.
[392.32 --> 393.22]  God says to him,
[393.34 --> 395.32]  Abraham, I will make you into a great nation
[395.32 --> 396.94]  and I'm going to bless you.
[397.38 --> 398.74]  I will make your name great
[398.74 --> 400.38]  and you will be a blessing.
[401.10 --> 402.78]  I will bless those who bless you
[402.78 --> 403.92]  and whoever curses you,
[404.02 --> 404.70]  I will curse
[404.70 --> 407.22]  and all peoples on earth
[407.22 --> 409.80]  will be blessed through you.
[410.90 --> 412.82]  Now, what's the repeated word you see in there?
[414.52 --> 414.92]  Bless.
[415.50 --> 416.76]  And that's not some trite word
[416.76 --> 418.08]  that you say after someone sneezes
[418.08 --> 418.82]  like we do now.
[419.42 --> 421.94]  That word is the fullness of human life.
[422.74 --> 425.60]  To bless is to be sort of undo the curse,
[425.76 --> 426.90]  undo the weight of sin
[426.90 --> 428.54]  and experience the flourishing of life
[428.54 --> 430.00]  as God created it.
[430.50 --> 432.22]  And God says to Abraham,
[432.72 --> 434.74]  the blessing of my life is going to flow
[434.74 --> 436.84]  not just to you and the Israelites,
[437.02 --> 439.06]  but through you to the nations.
[440.24 --> 441.94]  And Exodus 19 is God saying,
[442.18 --> 444.50]  now Israel, you belong to me
[444.50 --> 446.10]  and I'm going to use you
[446.10 --> 447.46]  to bring forth my blessing.
[448.72 --> 450.42]  Privilege, responsibility.
[450.96 --> 453.18]  God always has the nations in mind.
[453.32 --> 455.28]  He always has the wider view
[455.28 --> 456.36]  beyond his people
[456.36 --> 458.54]  that his blessing is going to reach.
[459.52 --> 460.16]  So with that in mind,
[460.22 --> 461.56]  let's take a look at Exodus 19.
[462.06 --> 462.86]  The people of Israel,
[462.98 --> 464.16]  they travel for three months
[464.16 --> 464.62]  to the wilderness
[464.62 --> 465.70]  and last week we looked at
[465.70 --> 466.96]  how they grumbled along the way.
[467.52 --> 468.88]  They whined and complained
[468.88 --> 469.86]  and God showed to them
[469.86 --> 470.82]  he's not just a redeemer,
[471.04 --> 471.82]  he's a provider.
[472.00 --> 473.20]  He showed how he cares for them,
[473.20 --> 474.14]  he meets their needs,
[474.40 --> 475.26]  he's trustworthy.
[476.00 --> 476.88]  And then after three months
[476.88 --> 477.86]  of traveling in the desert,
[478.14 --> 479.42]  God brings them to Mount Sinai.
[479.74 --> 481.62]  The whole people camp around the mountain
[481.62 --> 483.36]  and then Moses goes up
[483.36 --> 484.40]  to speak with God.
[485.44 --> 486.96]  And God meets with Moses to say,
[487.52 --> 489.30]  this is what I want for my people.
[489.84 --> 491.66]  This is my vision for Israel.
[492.08 --> 493.08]  And Moses goes down
[493.08 --> 494.00]  and brings that vision
[494.00 --> 495.86]  and that plan to his people.
[496.18 --> 497.02]  In fact, Moses goes up
[497.02 --> 498.68]  and down this mountain three times
[498.68 --> 500.38]  to communicate God's plan,
[500.52 --> 502.12]  God's intention for Israel.
[503.20 --> 505.62]  And the first thing God says to Moses,
[505.96 --> 507.10]  after all he's done in Egypt,
[507.22 --> 507.92]  after all the rescue,
[508.02 --> 509.06]  after all the plagues, everything,
[509.36 --> 510.42]  the first word God gives
[510.42 --> 511.82]  is not rules,
[512.66 --> 513.46]  it's not instructions,
[513.66 --> 514.26]  it's not laws,
[514.86 --> 516.36]  it's recounting his grace.
[517.82 --> 518.40]  God says,
[518.60 --> 520.14]  you yourselves have seen
[520.14 --> 522.32]  what I did to Egypt
[522.32 --> 524.90]  and how I carried you on eagle's wings
[524.90 --> 526.96]  and brought you to myself.
[526.96 --> 529.90]  Now I love that image.
[530.58 --> 531.38]  And since moving to BC,
[531.48 --> 533.96]  I think my favorite bird is an eagle.
[535.10 --> 536.44]  And I love how eagles
[536.44 --> 538.32]  are very powerful predators
[538.32 --> 540.16]  and also known for being
[540.16 --> 541.60]  very protective nurturers.
[542.42 --> 543.50]  Actually, just a few weeks ago,
[543.60 --> 544.20]  behind my house,
[544.26 --> 544.76]  there was an eagle
[544.76 --> 546.28]  just kind of swooping around.
[546.40 --> 547.36]  I'm sure you've all seen them around.
[547.42 --> 548.32]  And there's a bunch of crows,
[548.40 --> 549.56]  my least favorite bird,
[549.86 --> 550.94]  going after this eagle.
[551.18 --> 552.50]  And he's just tolerating it.
[552.74 --> 553.30]  And all of a sudden,
[553.36 --> 554.06]  the eagle got fed up
[554.06 --> 555.12]  and just dove at one of them
[555.12 --> 556.28]  and all of them dispersed.
[556.80 --> 557.80]  They're powerful predators.
[557.94 --> 558.86]  You don't mess with the eagle.
[559.50 --> 561.18]  But they're also protective.
[562.16 --> 562.92]  And this passage,
[563.00 --> 564.08]  I think God is both.
[564.82 --> 566.02]  God is the powerful predator
[566.02 --> 567.26]  who showed Egypt.
[567.68 --> 569.12]  He showed the gods they worshipped
[569.12 --> 570.18]  who's the real God.
[570.48 --> 571.76]  And then in a protective,
[572.02 --> 573.02]  nurturing, loving manner,
[573.10 --> 574.34]  he carries Israel
[574.34 --> 576.50]  all the way to Mount Sinai
[576.50 --> 577.40]  to himself.
[579.70 --> 580.94]  Scholars are quick to point out
[580.94 --> 582.26]  that in this passage,
[582.26 --> 584.50]  before a word is said
[584.50 --> 585.92]  of how Israel's to live,
[586.00 --> 587.06]  God does all the heavy lifting.
[587.96 --> 589.02]  God didn't say to Israel,
[589.18 --> 590.26]  if you do all these things,
[590.30 --> 590.98]  then I'll rescue you.
[591.00 --> 591.94]  In fact, God rescued
[591.94 --> 592.76]  the slave nation.
[593.22 --> 594.06]  He showed his power.
[594.18 --> 594.92]  He showed his deliverance.
[594.98 --> 596.14]  And then after all that is done,
[596.18 --> 596.44]  he says,
[596.52 --> 598.42]  now here's how I want you to live.
[599.02 --> 599.86]  And we need to realize
[599.86 --> 602.36]  that grace precedes instruction.
[603.12 --> 605.38]  His deliverance precedes his words
[605.38 --> 606.42]  on how they are to obey.
[606.54 --> 607.22]  And that's important
[607.22 --> 608.56]  because they now know
[608.56 --> 609.70]  that this is a rescuing,
[610.20 --> 612.20]  redeeming, trustworthy God,
[612.26 --> 613.54]  that is inviting them
[613.54 --> 615.52]  to obedience and covenant keeping.
[616.66 --> 617.60]  So let's take a look
[617.60 --> 618.64]  at what God now says.
[618.72 --> 619.72]  He's got Israel to himself.
[619.84 --> 620.82]  He's brought them to the mountain.
[620.92 --> 621.88]  And this is what he says
[621.88 --> 622.92]  is their job.
[623.16 --> 623.48]  He says,
[623.62 --> 623.78]  now,
[624.26 --> 626.00]  if you obey me fully
[626.00 --> 627.38]  and keep my covenant,
[627.80 --> 628.98]  then of all the nations,
[629.64 --> 631.18]  you will be my treasured possession.
[632.10 --> 634.76]  Although the whole earth is mine.
[635.20 --> 635.84]  I mean, what a statement.
[635.98 --> 637.14]  The whole earth is mine.
[637.70 --> 638.66]  You will be for me
[638.66 --> 639.68]  a kingdom of priests
[639.68 --> 641.74]  and a holy nation.
[642.78 --> 643.78]  There's the job description.
[644.86 --> 645.78]  Now, I want you to know
[645.78 --> 646.88]  before we even move on
[646.88 --> 647.88]  just how important
[647.88 --> 649.88]  this statement is.
[649.94 --> 650.46]  In fact, we're going to spend
[650.46 --> 651.32]  the rest of our time this morning
[651.32 --> 651.84]  on this statement.
[652.70 --> 653.78]  One scholar says,
[653.98 --> 655.44]  everything in the book of Exodus
[655.44 --> 656.86]  is leading up to this point.
[657.48 --> 658.48]  Everything God has done,
[658.58 --> 659.64]  all his redeeming power,
[659.76 --> 660.94]  all of the plagues on Egypt
[660.94 --> 661.48]  and their gods,
[661.70 --> 662.56]  all has brought them
[662.56 --> 663.04]  to this moment
[663.04 --> 663.44]  where he says,
[663.52 --> 664.92]  Israel, this is your job.
[665.76 --> 666.88]  Another scholar has said,
[667.14 --> 668.68]  the rest of the Old Testament
[668.68 --> 670.32]  is a commentary
[670.32 --> 672.12]  on this statement.
[672.74 --> 673.38]  That is to say,
[673.42 --> 674.16]  the rest of the Old Testament
[674.16 --> 674.86]  just tells us
[674.86 --> 676.42]  how well Israel does
[676.42 --> 678.44]  in being a kingdom of priests,
[678.86 --> 680.36]  in being a holy nation.
[681.20 --> 681.96]  So all I have to say is,
[682.00 --> 682.98]  this passage really matters,
[683.06 --> 683.62]  so we want to spend
[683.62 --> 684.40]  some time with it.
[685.56 --> 686.58]  First things first,
[687.66 --> 688.60]  God starts by saying,
[688.60 --> 689.66]  if you obey me fully
[689.66 --> 692.10]  and you keep my covenant.
[692.10 --> 692.26]  covenant.
[693.80 --> 694.80]  There's a word we don't use
[694.80 --> 695.64]  very often, covenant.
[696.14 --> 696.42]  In fact,
[696.74 --> 697.84]  when I googled the word covenant
[697.84 --> 698.98]  to see how people use it today,
[699.04 --> 699.70]  guess what came up?
[700.78 --> 701.14]  Churches.
[702.24 --> 703.08]  I think the only way
[703.08 --> 703.86]  we use the word covenant
[703.86 --> 705.14]  is when we talk about marriage,
[705.28 --> 705.52]  right?
[706.06 --> 706.74]  And we use that
[706.74 --> 707.94]  to talk about
[707.94 --> 709.64]  how significant this bond is,
[709.68 --> 711.36]  how deep the commitment is
[711.36 --> 712.04]  in a marriage.
[712.92 --> 713.92]  And I want you to understand
[713.92 --> 714.84]  that in the ancient Near East,
[714.96 --> 715.98]  covenants are important.
[716.38 --> 717.40]  They're very important.
[717.50 --> 718.00]  They're common
[718.00 --> 718.84]  and they're binding
[718.84 --> 719.54]  and in fact,
[719.80 --> 720.60]  there's consequences.
[720.76 --> 721.72]  If you don't keep your promise,
[721.72 --> 722.78]  if you don't keep your covenant,
[723.04 --> 724.02]  there's consequences
[724.02 --> 726.24]  for breaking your oath.
[727.30 --> 728.62]  Now, there's two main kinds
[728.62 --> 729.10]  of covenants
[729.10 --> 729.64]  in the Old Testament.
[730.00 --> 731.22]  One is between two equals,
[731.34 --> 731.86]  two parties.
[732.02 --> 732.68]  They kind of get together
[732.68 --> 732.96]  and they say,
[733.02 --> 734.26]  hey, we're going to share this land.
[734.32 --> 734.94]  You're going to bring this.
[735.00 --> 735.62]  I'm going to bring this.
[735.76 --> 737.04]  I promise to do this.
[737.10 --> 738.04]  I promise to take care
[738.04 --> 738.64]  of these flocks.
[738.96 --> 740.06]  And if I don't,
[740.12 --> 740.94]  here are the consequences.
[741.60 --> 742.14]  The other person
[742.14 --> 743.18]  makes the same kind of promise
[743.18 --> 744.02]  and then they enter
[744.02 --> 745.06]  into a covenant.
[746.08 --> 747.26]  The second kind of covenant,
[747.38 --> 748.26]  which is equally common,
[748.38 --> 749.18]  is where a king
[749.18 --> 749.90]  who would defeat
[749.90 --> 750.66]  a certain army,
[750.98 --> 752.26]  would go into the place
[752.26 --> 752.92]  where he defeated
[752.92 --> 753.60]  like the inhabitants
[753.60 --> 754.68]  of that kingdom
[754.68 --> 755.24]  and say,
[755.44 --> 756.88]  this is what's going to happen.
[757.56 --> 758.34]  We're going to enter
[758.34 --> 758.96]  into a covenant.
[759.12 --> 759.98]  I'm your new king.
[760.10 --> 760.70]  I'm the Lord.
[761.18 --> 762.36]  You belong to me
[762.36 --> 763.08]  as my people.
[763.54 --> 765.12]  This is what I promise to do.
[765.34 --> 766.30]  I'm going to keep you safe.
[766.36 --> 766.94]  I'll protect you.
[766.98 --> 767.88]  I'll fight wars for you.
[767.92 --> 769.12]  But you must also do this,
[769.22 --> 770.30]  provide grains, taxes,
[770.48 --> 771.54]  and fight in those wars.
[771.92 --> 773.80]  We are now in a covenant.
[774.52 --> 775.40]  This is binding.
[776.16 --> 777.76]  You are promising collectively
[777.76 --> 779.60]  to be my people.
[780.96 --> 781.54]  And writers have said,
[781.62 --> 782.32]  this is what's happening
[782.32 --> 783.34]  in Exodus 19.
[783.64 --> 784.78]  In fact, not just Exodus 19,
[784.88 --> 785.98]  but the whole book of Deuteronomy.
[786.46 --> 788.20]  These are covenant statements.
[788.36 --> 788.94]  God is saying,
[789.32 --> 791.30]  I'm now your king.
[792.46 --> 793.34]  No more Pharaoh.
[793.70 --> 794.44]  No more oppression.
[795.10 --> 796.48]  I'm now your Lord.
[796.58 --> 797.38]  And we are entering
[797.38 --> 799.58]  into a binding agreement.
[800.42 --> 801.48]  You've seen what I've done.
[801.48 --> 802.42]  I'm going to teach you
[802.42 --> 803.42]  the terms of the covenant.
[803.54 --> 804.20]  In fact, next week,
[804.20 --> 805.50]  when we look at the Ten Commandments,
[805.76 --> 807.02]  we look at what God
[807.02 --> 808.32]  is inviting His people to do,
[808.40 --> 809.06]  how to live.
[809.84 --> 811.30]  And then this document finishes
[811.30 --> 812.32]  with the people saying,
[812.84 --> 814.40]  we will do everything
[814.40 --> 815.36]  the Lord has commanded.
[815.86 --> 816.46]  It's a way of saying,
[816.56 --> 817.14]  we're going to enter
[817.14 --> 818.04]  into this relationship.
[818.50 --> 820.18]  We realize that God is our Lord
[820.18 --> 821.44]  and we are going to serve Him
[821.44 --> 823.62]  and dedicate the whole of our lives
[823.62 --> 825.52]  individually and communally
[825.52 --> 827.12]  to His purposes.
[828.58 --> 829.48]  I'm going to come back to this
[829.48 --> 830.12]  in just a few minutes,
[830.12 --> 831.42]  but I want you to realize
[831.42 --> 832.86]  that these covenants
[832.86 --> 834.20]  are serious business.
[835.08 --> 835.94]  And when Israel enters
[835.94 --> 837.16]  into this relationship with God,
[837.24 --> 839.10]  they recognize the weight
[839.10 --> 840.52]  of this commitment.
[841.24 --> 842.70]  They recognize the significance
[842.70 --> 843.50]  of what it means
[843.50 --> 845.24]  to be His covenant people.
[848.58 --> 850.38]  Now, as part of His covenant community,
[850.52 --> 851.72]  God then lays out the terms
[851.72 --> 852.76]  on what He wants for them.
[853.08 --> 854.48]  This is basically the why
[854.48 --> 855.94]  of what God has been up to
[855.94 --> 856.54]  in all of Exodus.
[856.70 --> 857.32]  He's basically said,
[857.38 --> 858.14]  you're now my people,
[858.22 --> 858.98]  you belong to me,
[859.06 --> 859.78]  there's terms of the covenant,
[859.78 --> 862.02]  this is what I have in store for you.
[862.08 --> 863.38]  The first thing God says is,
[863.94 --> 865.60]  you are my treasured possession.
[866.68 --> 867.84]  And I just love how God says,
[867.90 --> 868.82]  the whole earth is mine.
[869.52 --> 870.78]  All the nations are mine.
[871.16 --> 872.82]  All the places are mine.
[873.22 --> 874.14]  And yet Israel,
[874.40 --> 876.12]  I've called you.
[877.22 --> 878.56]  And you might think right there
[878.56 --> 880.24]  that wow, what a privilege.
[880.90 --> 882.68]  But then the responsibility comes.
[883.12 --> 883.92]  You will be for me
[883.92 --> 885.04]  a royal priesthood
[885.04 --> 886.94]  and you will be for me
[886.94 --> 887.76]  a holy nation.
[887.84 --> 888.72]  There's a job description.
[889.40 --> 890.20]  Royal priesthood,
[891.24 --> 891.80]  holy nation.
[891.88 --> 892.50]  I want to look at them
[892.50 --> 893.28]  in reverse order.
[893.46 --> 894.58]  Holy nation.
[895.28 --> 896.18]  What does it mean
[896.18 --> 897.96]  for Israel to be a holy nation?
[898.02 --> 899.12]  The first thing I want you to know
[899.12 --> 899.88]  is it doesn't mean
[899.88 --> 900.52]  they have to be perfect.
[901.82 --> 903.18]  Holy does not mean perfect,
[903.28 --> 904.02]  like holier than thou.
[904.08 --> 905.42]  Holy means distinct.
[905.82 --> 907.00]  It means set apart.
[907.12 --> 908.28]  God has pulled this people
[908.28 --> 908.82]  out of slavery.
[908.98 --> 909.70]  He's pulled them to Himself.
[909.82 --> 910.02]  He says,
[910.32 --> 911.32]  you're not like the other nations.
[911.60 --> 912.68]  You belong to me.
[913.36 --> 914.08]  You're not going to worship
[914.08 --> 914.74]  the way they worship.
[915.10 --> 915.76]  You're not going to live
[915.76 --> 916.42]  the way they live.
[916.42 --> 917.90]  We live the way they live.
[918.10 --> 918.84]  You're not going to organize
[918.84 --> 919.98]  your society the way
[919.98 --> 921.04]  they organize their society.
[921.34 --> 922.30]  You are distinct.
[923.44 --> 924.46]  You're my people.
[925.26 --> 925.52]  And again,
[925.58 --> 926.46]  next week we're going to come back
[926.46 --> 927.44]  to the specific ways
[927.44 --> 927.96]  God says,
[928.48 --> 929.74]  this is how you're going
[929.74 --> 930.52]  to live your lives.
[931.18 --> 931.96]  These are the instructions
[931.96 --> 932.60]  I have for you
[932.60 --> 933.04]  and they're going to lead
[933.04 --> 933.76]  to your flourishing.
[933.98 --> 934.28]  They're going to lead
[934.28 --> 934.92]  to your blessing.
[935.26 --> 935.66]  They're going to lead
[935.66 --> 936.64]  to the blessing of the nations.
[937.10 --> 939.32]  You are a holy nation.
[939.32 --> 941.96]  Then He says,
[942.38 --> 944.24]  you're royal priesthood.
[945.06 --> 947.08]  You are a kingdom of priests.
[947.76 --> 948.78]  And you might think again,
[948.84 --> 949.76]  Israel might feel,
[949.92 --> 950.72]  there might be the temptation
[950.72 --> 951.00]  to think,
[951.10 --> 951.78]  okay, we're going to do
[951.78 --> 952.88]  our own little thing in Canaan.
[953.14 --> 953.78]  We're going to have
[953.78 --> 954.60]  our own little religious
[954.60 --> 955.42]  commitment to God
[955.42 --> 956.06]  and the nations are going
[956.06 --> 956.54]  to do their thing.
[956.58 --> 957.36]  We're going to do our thing.
[957.54 --> 958.20]  But then God says,
[958.28 --> 959.84]  no, you're a kingdom of priests.
[960.84 --> 962.32]  And we dwell to ask the question,
[962.64 --> 964.06]  what does a priest do?
[964.92 --> 966.48]  What's a priest for?
[966.48 --> 968.78]  And simply put,
[969.50 --> 971.80]  a priest takes the blessing of God
[971.80 --> 974.10]  and they mediate that blessing
[974.10 --> 975.44]  and bring it to people.
[975.52 --> 976.28]  That's what priests do
[976.28 --> 977.36]  in the ancient Near East.
[978.00 --> 979.74]  And God is basically saying to Israel,
[980.44 --> 982.18]  you get to experience my blessing
[982.18 --> 982.96]  as a people
[982.96 --> 985.70]  and bring it to the world.
[986.98 --> 988.66]  You exist to bring my love,
[988.76 --> 989.80]  my grace, my truth,
[989.90 --> 990.88]  my justice, my mercy
[990.88 --> 991.76]  to the nations.
[992.54 --> 995.20]  You are blessed to be a blessing.
[995.20 --> 996.40]  Again, God's always got
[996.40 --> 997.96]  the nations in view.
[998.80 --> 999.50]  They are not allowed
[999.50 --> 1000.70]  to put a finer point out.
[1000.74 --> 1001.12]  They're not allowed
[1001.12 --> 1002.70]  to hoard the blessing of God.
[1003.66 --> 1004.08]  They're not allowed
[1004.08 --> 1004.78]  to take His grace,
[1004.90 --> 1005.56]  His mercy, His love
[1005.56 --> 1006.66]  and just keep it all to themselves
[1006.66 --> 1007.58]  like a circle of wagons.
[1007.66 --> 1008.16]  God says, nope,
[1008.36 --> 1009.16]  you're bringing that
[1009.16 --> 1009.74]  to the nations.
[1010.48 --> 1011.70]  And the intention is,
[1011.96 --> 1012.82]  God's going to place them
[1012.82 --> 1013.30]  in Canaan,
[1013.54 --> 1014.30]  which is abundant,
[1014.80 --> 1015.60]  but central.
[1016.10 --> 1016.80]  And if I haven't said this
[1016.80 --> 1017.44]  already in this series,
[1017.60 --> 1019.64]  Canaan is right smack dab
[1019.64 --> 1020.46]  in the ancient Near East
[1020.46 --> 1021.88]  so all the neighboring nations
[1021.88 --> 1022.88]  can travel through
[1022.88 --> 1024.04]  and see Israel.
[1024.04 --> 1025.74]  They're a display people.
[1025.86 --> 1027.30]  They're visible to the nations.
[1028.02 --> 1029.64]  And what Deuteronomy 4 says,
[1030.00 --> 1030.80]  it gives us this vision
[1030.80 --> 1031.54]  of all the nations
[1031.54 --> 1032.58]  around Israel
[1032.58 --> 1033.78]  looking at them
[1033.78 --> 1034.26]  and saying,
[1034.86 --> 1035.12]  wow,
[1036.36 --> 1037.62]  look at their laws.
[1038.30 --> 1039.14]  They're so just.
[1039.94 --> 1040.80]  Look how they take care
[1040.80 --> 1041.28]  of the vulnerable.
[1041.44 --> 1042.82]  Look how their families
[1042.82 --> 1044.22]  are safe.
[1044.98 --> 1046.68]  Look at how they are just
[1046.68 --> 1047.70]  in all the ways they do.
[1047.76 --> 1048.82]  Look at how well
[1048.82 --> 1050.06]  they live together.
[1050.06 --> 1051.98]  And they would see
[1051.98 --> 1052.84]  the blessing.
[1054.04 --> 1054.40]  They would see
[1054.40 --> 1055.88]  the shalom of God,
[1056.20 --> 1057.14]  the way the world
[1057.14 --> 1057.94]  and society
[1057.94 --> 1059.02]  was meant to be organized
[1059.02 --> 1060.20]  and be drawn in
[1060.20 --> 1061.20]  as they watch Israel
[1061.20 --> 1063.00]  to the life of God himself.
[1064.62 --> 1065.04]  They had to be
[1065.04 --> 1066.20]  a royal priesthood.
[1066.62 --> 1067.64]  So there's the job description
[1067.64 --> 1068.22]  for Israel.
[1068.78 --> 1069.40]  Holy nation,
[1069.60 --> 1070.34]  treasured possession,
[1071.18 --> 1072.24]  a royal priesthood,
[1072.38 --> 1074.12]  a kingdom of priests.
[1074.84 --> 1075.62]  That's it.
[1075.62 --> 1079.78]  And what I want to do now
[1079.78 --> 1080.66]  for the next few minutes
[1080.66 --> 1082.34]  is tease out
[1082.34 --> 1083.08]  what in the world
[1083.08 --> 1084.18]  this means for our church.
[1084.72 --> 1084.90]  You know,
[1084.92 --> 1085.70]  maybe this is your first time
[1085.70 --> 1086.52]  through the book of Exodus.
[1086.66 --> 1087.14]  This is your first time
[1087.14 --> 1087.78]  thinking about things
[1087.78 --> 1088.30]  like covenant
[1088.30 --> 1088.92]  and what it means
[1088.92 --> 1089.92]  to be a kingdom of priests.
[1090.20 --> 1091.18]  I want us to tease out
[1091.18 --> 1091.94]  what this looks like
[1091.94 --> 1092.92]  for the church today.
[1093.54 --> 1094.64]  And the first thing
[1094.64 --> 1095.30]  I want to say
[1095.30 --> 1097.86]  is how significant it is,
[1097.88 --> 1098.70]  this passage
[1098.70 --> 1100.02]  for the church.
[1100.82 --> 1101.92]  I'm going to read for you.
[1102.04 --> 1102.56]  This is a passage
[1102.56 --> 1103.62]  that comes from 1 Peter.
[1104.38 --> 1105.20]  1 Peter is written
[1105.20 --> 1105.86]  to churches
[1105.86 --> 1106.72]  in Asia Minor
[1106.72 --> 1108.38]  and listen to what he says
[1108.38 --> 1109.04]  to the churches.
[1109.34 --> 1109.84]  He says,
[1110.34 --> 1111.48]  you, church,
[1111.72 --> 1112.72]  little house church
[1112.72 --> 1113.52]  in Asia Minor,
[1113.90 --> 1115.28]  you are a chosen people.
[1115.62 --> 1116.82]  You are a royal priesthood,
[1116.88 --> 1117.68]  a holy nation,
[1118.00 --> 1119.28]  God's special possession
[1119.28 --> 1120.90]  that you would declare
[1120.90 --> 1121.66]  the praises of him
[1121.66 --> 1122.20]  who brought you
[1122.20 --> 1122.76]  out of darkness
[1122.76 --> 1125.00]  into his wonderful light.
[1126.32 --> 1127.26]  You see the language there?
[1127.84 --> 1128.56]  He's basically saying
[1128.56 --> 1129.94]  what was true for Israel
[1129.94 --> 1131.40]  is true for you.
[1131.94 --> 1132.96]  That mission,
[1133.24 --> 1133.82]  that blessing
[1133.82 --> 1135.04]  is same for you.
[1135.04 --> 1135.70]  You're the people
[1135.70 --> 1136.76]  who belong to God,
[1136.82 --> 1137.74]  you're his covenant people,
[1138.08 --> 1139.12]  and you are chosen
[1139.12 --> 1140.14]  to bring his blessing
[1140.14 --> 1140.80]  to the nations.
[1141.82 --> 1143.14]  Do we see that, church?
[1144.40 --> 1145.20]  No more,
[1145.32 --> 1145.94]  in the same way,
[1146.00 --> 1147.10]  can we be a private
[1147.10 --> 1148.52]  little clubhouse
[1148.52 --> 1149.12]  for believers.
[1149.84 --> 1150.92]  We can't hoard
[1150.92 --> 1151.94]  the blessing of God
[1151.94 --> 1152.76]  and just do our own
[1152.76 --> 1153.52]  little religious thing
[1153.52 --> 1154.20]  on Sunday mornings.
[1154.58 --> 1156.44]  We're a sent people,
[1156.78 --> 1157.90]  in the same way
[1157.90 --> 1160.10]  Israel was a sent people.
[1160.10 --> 1162.08]  You know,
[1162.10 --> 1162.44]  one of the things
[1162.44 --> 1162.98]  I've grieved
[1162.98 --> 1163.92]  over the course of COVID
[1163.92 --> 1165.50]  is the way that we've all
[1165.50 --> 1166.02]  been disconnected
[1166.02 --> 1166.72]  from one another.
[1167.94 --> 1168.62]  And one of the realities
[1168.62 --> 1169.96]  I just want to remind us of
[1169.96 --> 1171.14]  as we regather,
[1171.64 --> 1172.74]  the emphasis of this
[1172.74 --> 1173.40]  regathering
[1173.40 --> 1174.44]  isn't just Christians
[1174.44 --> 1175.28]  getting back together
[1175.28 --> 1176.00]  on Sunday mornings,
[1176.50 --> 1177.40]  but it's the church
[1177.40 --> 1178.36]  of Jesus Christ
[1178.36 --> 1179.80]  gathering to bless
[1179.80 --> 1180.60]  the city again.
[1181.30 --> 1182.32]  And I've seen how
[1182.32 --> 1182.78]  COVID,
[1183.02 --> 1184.02]  by no one's fault,
[1184.10 --> 1184.90]  has just disconnected
[1184.90 --> 1185.88]  churches from the life
[1185.88 --> 1186.34]  of the city.
[1187.00 --> 1187.64]  And part of what
[1187.64 --> 1188.16]  we need to be
[1188.16 --> 1188.92]  intentional about
[1188.92 --> 1190.50]  is reconnecting
[1190.50 --> 1191.76]  to the life
[1191.76 --> 1192.78]  of the city.
[1193.48 --> 1194.32]  We are called
[1194.32 --> 1195.38]  to bless.
[1196.18 --> 1197.26]  And it's very easy,
[1197.34 --> 1197.62]  I think,
[1197.64 --> 1198.82]  in this particular season
[1198.82 --> 1200.14]  to just feel
[1200.14 --> 1201.20]  like we're regathering
[1201.20 --> 1201.94]  and doing our own
[1201.94 --> 1203.36]  private religious club
[1203.36 --> 1204.42]  forgetting that
[1204.42 --> 1205.32]  we're sent.
[1208.02 --> 1208.52]  You know,
[1208.54 --> 1209.06]  I just want to share
[1209.06 --> 1209.72]  two ways
[1209.72 --> 1211.60]  that I've experienced
[1211.60 --> 1212.20]  that sentness
[1212.20 --> 1212.82]  of our own church
[1212.82 --> 1213.94]  in the last few months.
[1214.38 --> 1214.68]  And the first
[1214.68 --> 1215.32]  was in January.
[1215.46 --> 1215.90]  Some of you have,
[1215.90 --> 1216.18]  I think,
[1216.22 --> 1216.82]  heard this story.
[1216.96 --> 1217.96]  But over the course
[1217.96 --> 1218.42]  of Advent,
[1218.66 --> 1219.40]  we were doing
[1219.40 --> 1220.22]  raising money
[1220.22 --> 1221.32]  for two different causes.
[1221.46 --> 1222.40]  One was for a well
[1222.40 --> 1223.10]  in Sierra Leone.
[1223.60 --> 1224.88]  Our church has a thing
[1224.88 --> 1225.68]  for water projects.
[1225.78 --> 1226.34]  Every year we do
[1226.34 --> 1226.96]  water projects.
[1227.62 --> 1228.60]  And we also were
[1228.60 --> 1229.18]  raising money
[1229.18 --> 1230.28]  for abuse victims
[1230.28 --> 1231.46]  in our own city.
[1231.82 --> 1232.68]  And if you don't know this,
[1232.80 --> 1233.94]  over the course of COVID,
[1234.10 --> 1234.76]  domestic abuse
[1234.76 --> 1235.52]  was on the rise
[1235.52 --> 1236.20]  quite significantly.
[1236.38 --> 1236.70]  We thought,
[1236.82 --> 1237.56]  this is a cause
[1237.56 --> 1238.20]  we can get behind.
[1238.80 --> 1239.44]  And so we invited
[1239.44 --> 1239.84]  our church
[1239.84 --> 1240.70]  just to give to this
[1240.70 --> 1241.28]  and we partnered
[1241.28 --> 1242.58]  with an organization
[1242.58 --> 1243.08]  in Langley
[1243.08 --> 1244.08]  that had a specific
[1244.08 --> 1244.92]  program for people
[1244.92 --> 1245.76]  who experienced abuse
[1245.76 --> 1246.36]  or is professional
[1246.36 --> 1247.28]  counseling and care
[1247.28 --> 1248.12]  and all sorts of resources
[1248.12 --> 1249.54]  to help people in crisis.
[1250.28 --> 1251.16]  And so after we did
[1251.16 --> 1251.70]  this fundraising,
[1251.86 --> 1252.90]  I called up this organization
[1252.90 --> 1253.24]  and I said,
[1253.32 --> 1253.40]  hey,
[1253.48 --> 1254.00]  I'm a pastor
[1254.00 --> 1254.80]  at Hope Community Church
[1254.80 --> 1256.04]  and we have a donation
[1256.04 --> 1256.66]  we'd like to make
[1256.66 --> 1257.86]  to this specific cause.
[1258.54 --> 1259.02]  And the lady
[1259.02 --> 1259.72]  I was on the phone with,
[1259.78 --> 1260.02]  she said,
[1260.08 --> 1260.26]  okay,
[1260.44 --> 1260.62]  well,
[1260.76 --> 1262.14]  how much did you want to give?
[1262.60 --> 1262.90]  I said,
[1262.94 --> 1263.02]  well,
[1263.04 --> 1263.44]  our church,
[1263.58 --> 1264.20]  we'd like to give
[1264.20 --> 1265.14]  just over $10,000.
[1265.14 --> 1267.60]  Then the phone was silent.
[1268.98 --> 1269.56]  And she's like,
[1269.66 --> 1270.08]  pardon me,
[1270.20 --> 1270.98]  did you say that again?
[1271.66 --> 1271.92]  I was like,
[1271.94 --> 1272.12]  oh,
[1272.24 --> 1272.94]  we'd like to give
[1272.94 --> 1273.94]  this money towards
[1273.94 --> 1275.36]  this particular cause
[1275.36 --> 1276.18]  for abuse victim care.
[1276.28 --> 1276.40]  She's like,
[1276.42 --> 1276.52]  no,
[1276.54 --> 1276.60]  no,
[1276.66 --> 1277.52]  but how much did you say
[1277.52 --> 1278.10]  you were going to give?
[1278.66 --> 1279.08]  I said,
[1279.12 --> 1279.66]  $10,000.
[1281.04 --> 1281.68]  And she just said,
[1281.74 --> 1282.00]  wow,
[1282.84 --> 1283.74]  we've never had a church
[1283.74 --> 1284.62]  give us that kind of money.
[1285.78 --> 1286.08]  She said,
[1286.08 --> 1286.72]  I thought you were just here
[1286.72 --> 1287.74]  to care for one person
[1287.74 --> 1288.70]  or you had a person in mind
[1288.70 --> 1289.46]  that you wanted to support.
[1289.54 --> 1289.76]  She's like,
[1289.80 --> 1290.68]  but that money will fund
[1290.68 --> 1291.46]  the whole program
[1291.46 --> 1292.44]  for all the people
[1292.44 --> 1293.02]  who have signed up
[1293.02 --> 1293.50]  for this year.
[1295.00 --> 1295.40]  And of course,
[1295.52 --> 1296.56]  I don't know her story.
[1296.84 --> 1297.20]  Obviously,
[1297.28 --> 1298.22]  she didn't know of our church
[1298.22 --> 1298.86]  or anything about it,
[1298.88 --> 1300.08]  but I know for a fact
[1300.08 --> 1301.32]  that after that phone call
[1301.32 --> 1303.16]  that she saw the church
[1303.16 --> 1303.58]  as generous.
[1304.84 --> 1305.76]  She saw the church
[1305.76 --> 1307.48]  caring for the real needs
[1307.48 --> 1308.46]  in our own city.
[1309.28 --> 1309.90]  She experienced
[1309.90 --> 1311.34]  in a very small way
[1311.34 --> 1312.52]  blessing.
[1314.62 --> 1315.20]  Let me give you
[1315.20 --> 1315.62]  another story.
[1315.70 --> 1316.68]  This came from last week.
[1317.92 --> 1318.26]  Adele,
[1318.42 --> 1318.96]  my daughter and I,
[1319.02 --> 1319.10]  oh,
[1319.10 --> 1319.58]  she's not here.
[1319.96 --> 1320.70]  She's up in Cornerstone.
[1320.90 --> 1321.68]  So she wanted to serve
[1321.68 --> 1322.64]  at the Cloverdale Community Kitchen.
[1323.02 --> 1323.58]  And finally,
[1323.64 --> 1324.04]  we had a chance
[1324.04 --> 1324.92]  to go last Wednesday.
[1325.60 --> 1326.22]  I know many of you
[1326.22 --> 1327.22]  serve there on a regular basis.
[1327.38 --> 1328.24]  And so I'm just introducing
[1328.24 --> 1328.98]  her to the people
[1328.98 --> 1329.72]  and Linda Wing
[1329.72 --> 1330.78]  and Melanie and Jen
[1330.78 --> 1331.92]  and all the usual suspects.
[1332.88 --> 1332.96]  And,
[1333.04 --> 1333.78]  you know,
[1333.98 --> 1335.52]  we're serving.
[1335.62 --> 1336.14]  It's very different
[1336.14 --> 1336.66]  because of COVID.
[1336.76 --> 1337.60]  We can't share the meal.
[1337.82 --> 1338.80]  But I paired Adele up
[1338.80 --> 1339.42]  with Linda Wing.
[1339.68 --> 1340.52]  She's not here this morning.
[1340.56 --> 1341.16]  I think she's away.
[1341.76 --> 1342.62]  Linda Wing is totally
[1342.62 --> 1343.28]  oblivious to this.
[1343.36 --> 1343.46]  You know,
[1343.50 --> 1344.50]  she's serving the meals
[1344.50 --> 1345.66]  and she's basically
[1345.66 --> 1346.76]  saying the name
[1346.76 --> 1348.16]  of every single person
[1348.16 --> 1348.94]  who comes
[1348.94 --> 1349.94]  to get a meal.
[1350.02 --> 1351.22]  She knows all of their names
[1351.22 --> 1351.80]  and she knows
[1351.80 --> 1352.54]  where they live
[1352.54 --> 1353.40]  and what their story is.
[1353.46 --> 1354.22]  And Adele's just walking
[1354.22 --> 1354.58]  with Linda.
[1354.68 --> 1355.02]  And Linda's like,
[1355.10 --> 1355.74]  hey, so-and-so.
[1355.82 --> 1356.32]  Hey, so-and-so.
[1356.38 --> 1356.80]  How's this?
[1357.02 --> 1357.58]  How's that going?
[1357.62 --> 1358.30]  And I just said to Linda,
[1358.42 --> 1358.50]  like,
[1358.86 --> 1359.98]  how do you know
[1359.98 --> 1361.34]  all of their names?
[1362.04 --> 1362.86]  How do you know
[1362.86 --> 1363.74]  where they all live
[1363.74 --> 1364.60]  and what they're going through?
[1364.70 --> 1365.44]  And Linda just kind of
[1365.44 --> 1366.06]  shrugs her shoulder.
[1366.14 --> 1366.70]  No big deal.
[1367.24 --> 1368.18]  But I just watch her.
[1368.24 --> 1368.40]  I'm like,
[1368.62 --> 1369.96]  that is church
[1369.96 --> 1371.20]  right there.
[1372.04 --> 1373.02]  Not to mention
[1373.02 --> 1373.96]  Jamie in the back
[1373.96 --> 1374.56]  with Jonathan,
[1374.66 --> 1375.00]  our intern,
[1375.10 --> 1376.70]  just doing crazy amounts
[1376.70 --> 1377.14]  of dishes.
[1377.72 --> 1378.54]  Completely unseen.
[1378.66 --> 1379.22]  No one's noticing.
[1379.36 --> 1380.20]  Just dish after dish
[1380.20 --> 1380.60]  after dish.
[1380.90 --> 1382.22]  Small way of caring
[1382.22 --> 1382.88]  for the needs
[1382.88 --> 1383.44]  in the city.
[1384.70 --> 1386.56]  Blessed to be a blessing.
[1388.00 --> 1388.44]  Privilege.
[1389.52 --> 1389.96]  Responsibility.
[1390.68 --> 1391.40]  That's the first way
[1391.40 --> 1391.80]  I think we need
[1391.80 --> 1392.38]  to hear this passage.
[1392.66 --> 1393.18]  Number two,
[1394.30 --> 1395.76]  I think we need to realize
[1395.76 --> 1397.24]  how serious this passage is.
[1398.10 --> 1399.06]  The community of Israel
[1399.06 --> 1400.24]  is making a covenant
[1400.24 --> 1401.34]  commitment
[1401.34 --> 1402.92]  to obedience.
[1403.70 --> 1404.52]  And I think we need
[1404.52 --> 1405.02]  to recognize
[1405.02 --> 1405.68]  that we're still,
[1405.82 --> 1406.18]  first of all,
[1406.20 --> 1406.90]  a covenant community.
[1407.02 --> 1407.80]  If you've been to a baptism,
[1407.94 --> 1408.12]  you know,
[1408.18 --> 1408.92]  every time we baptize
[1408.92 --> 1410.02]  a child or an adult,
[1410.12 --> 1410.38]  we say,
[1410.70 --> 1411.50]  you are part of
[1411.50 --> 1412.84]  God's covenant community
[1412.84 --> 1414.94]  that receives the benefits
[1414.94 --> 1416.02]  that come to us in Jesus.
[1416.62 --> 1417.62]  You're part of the family
[1417.62 --> 1418.06]  of Jesus.
[1418.18 --> 1419.06]  We're a covenant community.
[1420.04 --> 1420.44]  But,
[1421.12 --> 1422.38]  that also invites us
[1422.38 --> 1423.96]  to a particular lifestyle,
[1424.34 --> 1425.52]  a particular way of living
[1425.52 --> 1427.00]  that follows the way of Jesus,
[1427.46 --> 1428.20]  and we're invited
[1428.20 --> 1428.82]  to obedience.
[1432.24 --> 1432.72]  You know,
[1432.78 --> 1433.46]  I just wonder,
[1433.46 --> 1435.18]  when people come
[1435.18 --> 1436.60]  to Western churches,
[1437.18 --> 1437.88]  when people walk
[1437.88 --> 1438.32]  into our church
[1438.32 --> 1439.08]  for the first time,
[1439.84 --> 1440.88]  do they see a community
[1440.88 --> 1441.20]  of people
[1441.20 --> 1443.22]  who are just devoted
[1443.22 --> 1444.62]  to the gospel
[1444.62 --> 1445.46]  of Jesus Christ?
[1447.22 --> 1447.64]  Devoted
[1447.64 --> 1449.28]  to making His name known?
[1450.72 --> 1451.56]  Or do they see
[1451.56 --> 1452.28]  sort of this
[1452.28 --> 1453.70]  private community
[1453.70 --> 1454.68]  that has some interest
[1454.68 --> 1455.70]  in this thing called Jesus,
[1455.84 --> 1456.42]  and we've got all this
[1456.42 --> 1457.26]  other stuff going on,
[1457.30 --> 1458.46]  it's sort of a side project?
[1459.36 --> 1460.02]  I just wonder,
[1460.10 --> 1461.06]  what do people see
[1461.06 --> 1462.20]  when they come
[1462.20 --> 1462.94]  into the church
[1462.94 --> 1463.86]  in the community?
[1463.94 --> 1464.38]  Is this a place
[1464.38 --> 1465.46]  that takes the gospel
[1465.46 --> 1467.08]  deadly seriously?
[1467.78 --> 1468.88]  Not ourselves too seriously.
[1469.56 --> 1470.50]  I don't think we can do that,
[1470.56 --> 1471.00]  but we can take
[1471.00 --> 1472.44]  the gospel deadly seriously.
[1472.92 --> 1473.54]  It's everything.
[1475.16 --> 1475.38]  You know,
[1475.42 --> 1475.94]  just this week
[1475.94 --> 1476.82]  I was reading a story
[1476.82 --> 1478.58]  about a guy named Douglas,
[1479.08 --> 1479.78]  Douglas Hall,
[1479.86 --> 1480.20]  I think.
[1481.54 --> 1481.90]  1940s,
[1482.28 --> 1483.44]  this is a man in British,
[1483.60 --> 1483.94]  in Britain,
[1484.10 --> 1484.90]  who is committed
[1484.90 --> 1486.14]  to the Communist Party
[1486.14 --> 1486.44]  in Britain.
[1486.54 --> 1486.86]  I didn't even know
[1486.86 --> 1487.68]  they had a Communist Party
[1487.68 --> 1488.14]  at that point.
[1488.60 --> 1489.82]  Very devoted to the cause.
[1489.82 --> 1490.90]  It was a small group of people.
[1491.00 --> 1491.78]  They read a lot.
[1491.88 --> 1492.60]  They recruited people
[1492.60 --> 1493.00]  into the group.
[1493.08 --> 1493.64]  They had to teach.
[1493.90 --> 1494.42]  They had to make sure
[1494.42 --> 1494.92]  they were living
[1494.92 --> 1495.68]  in a particular way
[1495.68 --> 1496.50]  that was in line
[1496.50 --> 1497.80]  with the Communist ideology
[1497.80 --> 1498.60]  they bought into,
[1498.98 --> 1500.06]  and this guy was sold.
[1500.74 --> 1502.02]  But through a series of events,
[1502.10 --> 1503.50]  including his disillusionment
[1503.50 --> 1504.52]  that this ideology
[1504.52 --> 1505.52]  would save the world,
[1505.90 --> 1506.96]  this guy became a Christian.
[1507.50 --> 1508.58]  And he left that meeting,
[1508.70 --> 1509.52]  and they had weekly meetings,
[1509.62 --> 1510.40]  all sorts of commitments
[1510.40 --> 1510.76]  they made,
[1510.82 --> 1511.94]  and then he joined a church.
[1512.56 --> 1513.74]  And then he was disillusioned
[1513.74 --> 1514.68]  in a whole new way
[1514.68 --> 1515.32]  because he said,
[1515.82 --> 1516.70]  in this small little
[1516.70 --> 1517.42]  Communist Party,
[1517.54 --> 1518.96]  I knew exactly how to live.
[1518.96 --> 1520.30]  I was called to a high level
[1520.30 --> 1521.38]  of sort of obedience.
[1521.66 --> 1522.46]  I knew what I was doing,
[1522.50 --> 1523.54]  and then I came to this church.
[1524.16 --> 1525.78]  It asked nothing of me.
[1526.70 --> 1527.64]  It had no sense
[1527.64 --> 1528.80]  of why it lived in this city.
[1529.02 --> 1530.54]  It was a confused bunch of people
[1530.54 --> 1531.60]  that did not understand
[1531.60 --> 1532.12]  what it meant
[1532.12 --> 1533.02]  to be part of a church.
[1533.82 --> 1534.62]  What a statement.
[1535.70 --> 1536.78]  And this guy basically said,
[1536.88 --> 1537.52]  I learned more about
[1537.52 --> 1538.90]  how to live a particular way
[1538.90 --> 1539.80]  and how to be devoted
[1539.80 --> 1540.36]  to a cause
[1540.36 --> 1541.74]  from the Communist group
[1541.74 --> 1542.66]  and not the church.
[1542.66 --> 1545.42]  That's a significant statement.
[1546.00 --> 1546.42]  And I wonder,
[1546.52 --> 1547.38]  how far have we come
[1547.38 --> 1549.48]  in 2021?
[1552.24 --> 1552.92]  In university,
[1553.02 --> 1553.62]  I had a friend.
[1553.96 --> 1554.22]  Actually,
[1554.26 --> 1555.08]  he was a housemate of mine.
[1555.50 --> 1556.64]  He always wore this hat.
[1556.80 --> 1557.60]  It sticks with me.
[1557.66 --> 1558.10]  The hat said
[1558.10 --> 1559.08]  in giant bold letters,
[1559.30 --> 1561.06]  Jesus is my homeboy.
[1561.84 --> 1562.44]  And it became
[1562.44 --> 1563.88]  a source of conversation,
[1564.28 --> 1565.82]  and he had quite a personality.
[1565.92 --> 1566.68]  He didn't often just say
[1566.68 --> 1567.44]  around our dorm,
[1567.50 --> 1567.68]  he's like,
[1567.76 --> 1568.74]  Jesus is my homeboy.
[1569.00 --> 1569.36]  You know,
[1569.36 --> 1570.60]  that kind of voice.
[1571.78 --> 1572.72]  And that hat somehow,
[1573.02 --> 1574.70]  and even the tone of that,
[1574.80 --> 1575.94]  just reminds me of the way,
[1576.02 --> 1577.00]  and how do I say this nicely?
[1577.58 --> 1578.96]  The way we trivialize Jesus.
[1579.92 --> 1581.44]  The way we trivialize the gospel.
[1582.24 --> 1582.86]  And of course,
[1582.94 --> 1583.86]  I'm not trashing the hat.
[1583.92 --> 1584.76]  I'm sure the hat is
[1584.76 --> 1586.52]  somehow connected
[1586.52 --> 1587.56]  maybe to John saying
[1587.56 --> 1588.46]  he's not just our Savior,
[1588.54 --> 1589.24]  but he's our friend.
[1590.12 --> 1591.30]  But Jesus is far more
[1591.30 --> 1592.08]  than just our friend.
[1594.00 --> 1594.78]  He's our Savior.
[1596.16 --> 1597.00]  He's our teacher.
[1598.14 --> 1599.26]  He's our Lord.
[1599.36 --> 1600.86]  Who rose from the dead
[1600.86 --> 1602.62]  and broke the power of sin.
[1603.42 --> 1603.90]  He's the one
[1603.90 --> 1605.30]  who Revelation 1 says,
[1605.48 --> 1606.36]  He's the ruler
[1606.36 --> 1608.00]  of the kingdoms of the earth.
[1609.42 --> 1610.26]  Colossians 1 says,
[1610.34 --> 1611.38]  He's the first and the last.
[1611.46 --> 1612.16]  The firstborn
[1612.16 --> 1613.14]  from among the dead.
[1613.20 --> 1613.82]  And in all things,
[1613.86 --> 1614.78]  He has the supremacy.
[1615.40 --> 1616.20]  Is that the Jesus
[1616.20 --> 1617.02]  we're devoted to?
[1618.30 --> 1619.20]  Is that the Jesus
[1619.20 --> 1620.48]  we come Sunday after Sunday
[1620.48 --> 1622.42]  to worship and glorify
[1622.42 --> 1623.78]  and give the whole
[1623.78 --> 1624.88]  of our lives to?
[1626.78 --> 1627.76]  Is that how we see
[1627.76 --> 1628.56]  the Christian faith?
[1629.36 --> 1631.04]  Because I think
[1631.04 --> 1632.18]  there's so many ways
[1632.18 --> 1633.54]  where subtly
[1633.54 --> 1634.38]  and not so subtly,
[1634.48 --> 1635.46]  we've trivialized
[1635.46 --> 1637.00]  the gospel of Jesus.
[1637.78 --> 1639.26]  And we dishonor His name
[1639.26 --> 1640.48]  and what it means
[1640.48 --> 1641.78]  to be His covenant community.
[1642.54 --> 1644.16]  This is serious stuff.
[1645.62 --> 1646.36]  And we are called
[1646.36 --> 1647.46]  to serious commitment.
[1648.14 --> 1649.22]  And that involves
[1649.22 --> 1650.14]  obedience.
[1651.34 --> 1652.22]  It involves
[1652.22 --> 1653.22]  wholehearted commitment.
[1653.22 --> 1654.54]  And by the way,
[1654.60 --> 1655.08]  that obedience
[1655.08 --> 1655.70]  is the way
[1655.70 --> 1656.74]  we experience blessing.
[1657.34 --> 1657.74]  It's the way
[1657.74 --> 1658.34]  we experience
[1658.34 --> 1658.98]  God's goodness
[1658.98 --> 1659.72]  and His love
[1659.72 --> 1660.22]  and His kindness
[1660.22 --> 1660.86]  and His justice
[1660.86 --> 1662.04]  coming into our lives
[1662.04 --> 1662.52]  and our families
[1662.52 --> 1663.08]  and our church.
[1663.32 --> 1664.66]  It's also the same way
[1664.66 --> 1665.42]  that the city
[1665.42 --> 1666.28]  experiences it.
[1666.40 --> 1667.58]  When we're following Jesus,
[1667.96 --> 1668.96]  we're committed to Him,
[1669.16 --> 1670.18]  that's when the blessing
[1670.18 --> 1671.24]  flows into our city.
[1672.04 --> 1672.70]  It's not when we're
[1672.70 --> 1673.38]  sort of resisting
[1673.38 --> 1674.02]  and half-hearted
[1674.02 --> 1674.82]  in our commitment
[1674.82 --> 1675.90]  that that blessing flows.
[1677.00 --> 1677.60]  And maybe,
[1678.34 --> 1679.18]  I realize sometimes
[1679.18 --> 1679.82]  this message
[1679.82 --> 1680.46]  can be misheard,
[1680.46 --> 1681.56]  you might think,
[1681.64 --> 1682.10]  well, that sounds
[1682.10 --> 1683.40]  a lot like legalism, Dave.
[1683.44 --> 1684.60]  All this talk of obedience.
[1685.38 --> 1686.04]  But I want to just
[1686.04 --> 1686.68]  help you see
[1686.68 --> 1688.16]  how this is such good news.
[1690.50 --> 1691.48]  Jesus came
[1691.48 --> 1693.64]  so that we could obey.
[1694.64 --> 1695.74]  The story of Israel
[1695.74 --> 1696.40]  after they give
[1696.40 --> 1696.86]  their commitment
[1696.86 --> 1697.70]  in Exodus 19
[1697.70 --> 1698.80]  is failure.
[1699.70 --> 1700.38]  They could not,
[1700.48 --> 1701.64]  because of the power of sin,
[1701.94 --> 1702.64]  be that people
[1702.64 --> 1703.50]  who bless the nations.
[1703.56 --> 1704.70]  They could not resist
[1704.70 --> 1705.98]  the seductive power of idols.
[1706.28 --> 1706.98]  And so God says,
[1707.10 --> 1708.00]  I'm going to act again.
[1708.18 --> 1708.88]  And this time,
[1708.94 --> 1709.98]  I'm sending my own son
[1709.98 --> 1711.22]  and he's going to defeat
[1711.22 --> 1713.02]  the very power of sin
[1713.02 --> 1714.38]  that has plagued Israel
[1714.38 --> 1715.84]  for thousands of years.
[1717.60 --> 1718.22]  And then,
[1718.30 --> 1719.02]  not only that,
[1719.48 --> 1720.50]  I'm going to enable
[1720.50 --> 1721.52]  by my grace
[1721.52 --> 1723.54]  my people to obey.
[1724.32 --> 1724.46]  You know,
[1724.48 --> 1725.80]  as Jesus regathers Israel,
[1725.90 --> 1726.68]  his 12 disciples,
[1726.76 --> 1727.40]  and he sends them out,
[1727.46 --> 1728.28]  before he sends them out,
[1728.32 --> 1728.90]  you know what he says?
[1729.12 --> 1730.16]  Don't go anywhere
[1730.16 --> 1732.30]  until you've been
[1732.30 --> 1733.32]  clothed with my power.
[1734.46 --> 1735.70]  Don't go anywhere
[1735.70 --> 1736.78]  until you've been
[1736.78 --> 1737.86]  filled with the Holy Spirit
[1737.86 --> 1738.44]  who will equip
[1738.44 --> 1739.34]  and lead
[1739.34 --> 1740.22]  and give you power
[1740.22 --> 1740.82]  and authority
[1740.82 --> 1742.48]  to do what I've called you to do,
[1742.80 --> 1744.22]  to live in commitment
[1744.22 --> 1745.58]  and obedience.
[1746.86 --> 1748.08]  The power of Jesus
[1748.08 --> 1749.38]  enables us
[1749.38 --> 1750.32]  to obey.
[1750.46 --> 1751.46]  Do you see the connection there?
[1752.18 --> 1753.46]  The difference between us
[1753.46 --> 1753.96]  and Israel
[1753.96 --> 1755.26]  is that we live
[1755.26 --> 1756.44]  after the empty tomb.
[1757.12 --> 1757.70]  We live after
[1757.70 --> 1758.76]  forgiving power
[1758.76 --> 1759.58]  and the grace of Jesus
[1759.58 --> 1760.72]  filled with the Holy Spirit
[1760.72 --> 1761.82]  that enables us
[1761.82 --> 1762.76]  to do what Israel
[1762.76 --> 1763.36]  never could do.
[1763.42 --> 1764.22]  Do you see that connection?
[1765.08 --> 1765.98]  And that's good news.
[1765.98 --> 1766.10]  Jesus,
[1766.82 --> 1767.52]  we're able
[1767.52 --> 1768.56]  to obey.
[1768.76 --> 1769.38]  Be perfect?
[1769.54 --> 1769.78]  No.
[1770.22 --> 1771.02]  We fall on our faces
[1771.02 --> 1771.90]  all the time
[1771.90 --> 1773.54]  and Jesus meets us
[1773.54 --> 1774.02]  in grace
[1774.02 --> 1775.06]  and mercy
[1775.06 --> 1775.76]  and forgiveness
[1775.76 --> 1776.52]  and love.
[1777.32 --> 1777.84]  Picks us up
[1777.84 --> 1778.60]  by his power,
[1778.86 --> 1780.04]  renews us with his spirit
[1780.04 --> 1780.52]  and says,
[1781.12 --> 1781.80]  be my blessing.
[1782.98 --> 1784.10]  Experience my life.
[1785.14 --> 1785.62]  Share it
[1785.62 --> 1786.18]  in your city.
[1786.18 --> 1790.84]  So as we read Exodus 19,
[1790.98 --> 1791.64]  I want you to hear
[1791.64 --> 1792.58]  that job description
[1792.58 --> 1793.88]  for Israel
[1793.88 --> 1796.30]  as our job description today.
[1796.76 --> 1797.60]  Just like 1 Peter.
[1798.96 --> 1799.90]  Royal priesthood,
[1800.96 --> 1801.72]  holy nation,
[1802.82 --> 1803.90]  treasured possession,
[1805.04 --> 1805.84]  the riches
[1805.84 --> 1807.36]  and the privileges
[1807.36 --> 1808.38]  of being God's people
[1808.38 --> 1810.38]  and the responsibility.
[1811.54 --> 1813.52]  Be my blessing.
[1813.52 --> 1815.64]  you are sent
[1815.64 --> 1817.94]  to bring that love,
[1818.10 --> 1818.66]  that grace,
[1818.78 --> 1819.30]  that mercy,
[1819.42 --> 1819.90]  that justice,
[1820.04 --> 1820.64]  that truth
[1820.64 --> 1822.08]  to the city.
[1823.70 --> 1824.80]  And hope I find
[1824.80 --> 1825.50]  or I hope
[1825.50 --> 1826.24]  that we respond
[1826.24 --> 1827.08]  to this passage
[1827.08 --> 1828.52]  in the same way
[1828.52 --> 1829.36]  that Israel did
[1829.36 --> 1831.16]  with that renewed desire
[1831.16 --> 1831.52]  to say,
[1831.76 --> 1832.90]  we will do
[1832.90 --> 1835.00]  by God's grace
[1835.00 --> 1836.40]  everything
[1836.40 --> 1838.70]  he's commanded us to do.
[1839.84 --> 1840.52]  Let's pray.
[1840.52 --> 1840.60]  Amen.
[1843.52 --> 1847.00]  Father,
[1847.06 --> 1847.68]  we thank you
[1847.68 --> 1850.20]  that you walk with us.
[1851.72 --> 1852.44]  We thank you
[1852.44 --> 1852.84]  that we get
[1852.84 --> 1853.78]  to be your people.
[1855.70 --> 1856.24]  And Lord,
[1856.28 --> 1856.72]  we just ask
[1856.72 --> 1857.42]  that you'd forgive us
[1857.42 --> 1857.80]  for the way
[1857.80 --> 1858.84]  we trivialize
[1858.84 --> 1859.86]  the gospel,
[1860.82 --> 1861.94]  for the way
[1861.94 --> 1862.30]  we live
[1862.30 --> 1863.02]  with half-hearted
[1863.02 --> 1863.64]  obedience,
[1864.72 --> 1865.72]  for the way
[1865.72 --> 1866.50]  we just rebel
[1866.50 --> 1868.72]  in all sorts of ways.
[1869.48 --> 1870.20]  And we pray
[1870.20 --> 1870.82]  that the mercy
[1870.82 --> 1871.36]  of Jesus
[1871.36 --> 1873.16]  would find us
[1873.16 --> 1873.92]  in those places,
[1874.86 --> 1875.34]  renew us
[1875.34 --> 1875.98]  in those places,
[1876.48 --> 1877.58]  and that we would
[1877.58 --> 1878.16]  be able to
[1878.16 --> 1879.32]  experience your grace,
[1880.14 --> 1881.14]  experience your blessing,
[1882.00 --> 1883.02]  and live that out.
[1884.94 --> 1885.34]  Father,
[1885.40 --> 1885.78]  we thank you
[1885.78 --> 1886.40]  that you meet us
[1886.40 --> 1886.96]  this morning
[1886.96 --> 1888.66]  and that you nourish
[1888.66 --> 1889.50]  us by your word
[1889.50 --> 1891.28]  and by this meal
[1891.28 --> 1892.18]  we're about to celebrate.
[1892.98 --> 1893.38]  Amen.
[1893.38 --> 1897.06]  At this time,
[1897.10 --> 1898.02]  I'm just going to invite us
[1898.02 --> 1898.96]  to prepare our hearts
[1898.96 --> 1899.50]  for communion.
[1899.64 --> 1900.16]  We're going to celebrate
[1900.16 --> 1901.14]  the Lord's Supper together.
[1902.00 --> 1902.92]  And our children
[1902.92 --> 1904.50]  who are out
[1904.50 --> 1905.12]  in Cornerstone,
[1905.20 --> 1905.46]  they're going to
[1905.46 --> 1906.10]  rejoin us.
[1906.30 --> 1906.96]  But I just invite you
[1906.96 --> 1907.40]  to spend some time
[1907.40 --> 1907.80]  in prayer,
[1908.70 --> 1909.18]  spend some time
[1909.18 --> 1909.68]  in confession,
[1909.92 --> 1910.40]  bring to the Lord
[1910.40 --> 1910.90]  what needs to be
[1910.90 --> 1911.50]  brought to the Lord
[1911.50 --> 1912.30]  and then when the time
[1912.30 --> 1912.70]  is right,
[1913.22 --> 1913.98]  you can just get up
[1913.98 --> 1914.50]  with your families
[1914.50 --> 1915.12]  or as individuals
[1915.12 --> 1915.84]  and there's tables
[1915.84 --> 1916.46]  in the back
[1916.46 --> 1917.28]  and in the front
[1917.28 --> 1918.12]  and I believe
[1918.12 --> 1918.74]  there's gluten-free
[1918.74 --> 1919.46]  at all of them.
[1919.76 --> 1919.96]  Candy,
[1920.02 --> 1920.42]  is that true?
[1921.22 --> 1921.72]  Where's Candy?
[1922.48 --> 1923.04]  Is that true?
[1923.28 --> 1923.42]  Yeah?
[1923.56 --> 1923.76]  Okay.
[1924.58 --> 1925.46]  So you can grab
[1925.46 --> 1925.92]  the elements
[1925.92 --> 1926.50]  with your families,
[1926.66 --> 1927.36]  bring them back
[1927.36 --> 1927.76]  to your seats,
[1927.86 --> 1928.38]  don't eat them
[1928.38 --> 1928.90]  and we'll do it
[1928.90 --> 1929.64]  all together.
[1929.78 --> 1930.28]  So don't eat them
[1930.28 --> 1930.76]  when you get up there,
[1930.82 --> 1931.62]  bring the elements back
[1931.62 --> 1932.52]  and we'll celebrate
[1932.52 --> 1933.94]  this meal together.
