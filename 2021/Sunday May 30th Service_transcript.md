[0.00 --> 10.76]  Thanks for that prayer, Carolyn. That was really beautiful.
[12.46 --> 13.76]  Well, good morning, everyone.
[14.48 --> 14.92]  Good morning.
[15.10 --> 16.34]  Oh, thanks, Stuart.
[17.08 --> 18.96]  Actually, let's do that again. Good morning, everyone.
[19.24 --> 19.92]  Good morning.
[20.66 --> 22.26]  Oh, it's such a good way to start the morning.
[22.38 --> 24.38]  It is a joy to be here with you guys.
[24.38 --> 28.62]  I never thought I'd come to Hope Community Church in this kind of a setting,
[28.62 --> 30.04]  but it's really great.
[30.12 --> 32.14]  This is a wonderful setup that you guys have here.
[32.64 --> 33.64]  My name is Jenna Fabiano.
[33.80 --> 36.90]  As Jonathan mentioned, I'm one of the pastors at Willoughby CRC,
[37.02 --> 38.74]  just eight minutes that way.
[39.48 --> 42.22]  And yeah, I'm really grateful that Dave invited me to be here.
[42.34 --> 45.24]  And we're going to be opening up the book of Ephesians this morning.
[45.32 --> 49.28]  So if you've got a Bible with you, you can turn to the book of Ephesians.
[49.88 --> 52.88]  We're going to be looking at a section in this letter
[52.88 --> 57.46]  where Paul is shifting gears from having just spoken about the great calling
[57.46 --> 59.94]  that exists on the church of Jesus Christ
[59.94 --> 62.62]  to now how to live out that calling,
[62.78 --> 64.50]  actually, as Carolyn mentioned in her prayer.
[65.66 --> 67.44]  In this particular part of it,
[67.50 --> 70.78]  and I think this is appropriate for the church to be looking at at the moment,
[70.92 --> 73.24]  the book of Ephesians is such a helpful letter
[73.24 --> 75.62]  to remind the church of who we are.
[76.18 --> 77.56]  And, you know, in this season of COVID,
[77.68 --> 81.20]  I think every church in varying ways and to varying degrees
[81.20 --> 83.20]  has had to struggle with the question
[83.20 --> 85.46]  of who are we as the church of Christ?
[85.72 --> 86.54]  Who are we?
[86.76 --> 87.72]  What are we called to?
[87.80 --> 89.04]  How are we supposed to live?
[89.12 --> 90.80]  What are we supposed to do in this season?
[91.18 --> 92.56]  All of those kinds of questions,
[92.70 --> 95.32]  existential crises of the church kind of questions.
[95.90 --> 99.06]  And this letter to the Ephesians is such a good book to turn to
[99.06 --> 100.80]  in these kinds of circumstances
[100.80 --> 104.98]  because Paul's kind of throwing a bit of a wake-up pie in the face
[104.98 --> 108.82]  to these churches explaining who they are called to be
[108.82 --> 113.12]  in light of the perspective of the Lord who created it.
[114.36 --> 117.40]  How is the Lord looking at the church, in other words?
[117.46 --> 119.90]  Rather than how are we constantly looking inwards at ourselves,
[120.10 --> 123.42]  how is the Lord looking at this church that he has created?
[123.96 --> 126.82]  So for the first three chapters in the letter of Ephesians,
[127.24 --> 132.42]  Paul waxes eloquently about this magnificent vision for the church,
[132.92 --> 135.04]  this new humanity that's being created,
[135.04 --> 138.30]  this beautiful new society that has been chosen by God,
[138.82 --> 140.28]  and now as John Stott put it,
[140.52 --> 142.48]  now the apostle moves in chapter four.
[142.62 --> 146.74]  He moves on from the new society to the new standards
[146.74 --> 148.70]  that are expected of it.
[149.44 --> 152.86]  From mind-stretching theology to its down-to-earth,
[153.08 --> 155.76]  concrete implications for everyday living.
[156.06 --> 156.28]  All right?
[156.36 --> 159.06]  So we're getting pretty down-to-earth in this sermon this morning.
[159.32 --> 161.78]  So we're looking at, again, Ephesians chapter four,
[161.86 --> 164.04]  and we're going to be reading one through 16,
[164.18 --> 167.28]  which is a good chunk, but we'll go through it in the sermon.
[167.28 --> 171.64]  So starting at chapter four, verse one, Paul writes this,
[171.64 --> 174.38]  As a prisoner for the Lord, then,
[174.48 --> 178.76]  I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.
[179.48 --> 181.22]  Be completely humble and gentle.
[181.90 --> 184.42]  Be patient, bearing with one another in love.
[185.14 --> 189.56]  Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
[190.30 --> 192.22]  There is one body and one Spirit,
[192.62 --> 195.20]  just as you were called to one hope when you were called.
[195.20 --> 198.60]  One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
[199.12 --> 200.58]  one God and Father of all,
[200.76 --> 203.32]  who is over all and through all and in all.
[204.50 --> 208.04]  But to each one of us, grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.
[208.44 --> 209.34]  This is why it says,
[209.60 --> 210.70]  When he ascended on high,
[210.86 --> 213.62]  he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.
[214.36 --> 215.76]  What does he ascended mean,
[215.84 --> 218.60]  except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions.
[218.60 --> 223.68]  He who ascended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens
[223.68 --> 225.42]  in order to fill the whole universe.
[226.46 --> 229.60]  So Christ himself gave the apostles,
[230.02 --> 231.42]  the prophets, the evangelists,
[231.52 --> 232.62]  the pastors, the teachers,
[232.84 --> 235.70]  to equip his people for works of service
[235.70 --> 238.72]  so that the body of Christ may be built up
[238.72 --> 241.54]  until we all reach unity in the faith
[241.54 --> 243.60]  and in the knowledge of the Son of God
[243.60 --> 245.46]  and become mature,
[246.10 --> 249.34]  attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[250.56 --> 252.22]  Then we will no longer be infants,
[252.52 --> 254.18]  tossed back and forth by the waves
[254.18 --> 256.72]  and blown here and there by every wind of teaching
[256.72 --> 258.86]  and by the cunning and craftiness of people
[258.86 --> 260.24]  and their deceitful scheming.
[260.84 --> 263.32]  Instead, speaking the truth in love,
[263.72 --> 266.16]  we will grow to become in every respect
[266.16 --> 269.20]  the mature body of him who is the head,
[269.26 --> 270.02]  that is Christ.
[270.02 --> 272.66]  From him, the whole body,
[273.10 --> 275.88]  joined and held together by every supporting ligament,
[276.52 --> 278.64]  grows and builds itself up in love
[278.64 --> 280.96]  as each part does its work.
[281.54 --> 283.10]  This is the word of the Lord.
[285.38 --> 287.84]  Okay, so I know there's a lot there.
[288.30 --> 290.62]  Paul writes really, really depthfully
[290.62 --> 292.48]  in the letter to the Ephesians, right?
[292.60 --> 294.46]  But we're going to start right at verse 1
[294.46 --> 296.24]  because Paul's initial push,
[296.40 --> 299.88]  his main urging in this particular passage
[299.88 --> 301.54]  starts right away at verse 1.
[301.62 --> 302.22]  He says this,
[302.58 --> 306.50]  Live a life worthy of the calling you have received.
[307.86 --> 311.48]  Live a life worthy of the calling.
[311.64 --> 314.88]  Well, wait, Paul hasn't told us to do anything yet,
[314.98 --> 316.96]  so what kind of calling is he talking about?
[317.68 --> 319.04]  Well, the calling that he's just spent
[319.04 --> 320.54]  the first three chapters explaining.
[321.46 --> 325.00]  See, because your calling isn't what you do.
[325.92 --> 326.68]  It's who you are.
[327.70 --> 329.34]  This is really important for us to understand.
[329.34 --> 331.70]  If we don't understand who we are,
[331.90 --> 333.56]  we're not going to understand our calling.
[334.20 --> 335.06]  Why do I say that?
[335.10 --> 337.42]  Because that's the consistent narrative
[337.42 --> 338.64]  that we see in Scripture.
[339.66 --> 340.72]  Think back to the very beginning.
[340.88 --> 342.54]  Back in the early chapters of Genesis,
[342.76 --> 343.50]  for Adam and Eve,
[343.78 --> 345.24]  the life to be lived for them
[345.24 --> 347.02]  was stewarding the earth, right?
[347.54 --> 349.28]  They were called to be guarders,
[349.62 --> 351.38]  watchers, keepers, priests
[351.38 --> 353.00]  in God's creation temple.
[353.10 --> 353.96]  That was their role.
[354.08 --> 355.26]  That was their responsibility.
[355.26 --> 358.88]  But the call on Adam and Eve
[358.88 --> 360.52]  was to be image bearers.
[361.64 --> 363.56]  They were only tasked
[363.56 --> 366.00]  with being keepers and guarders
[366.00 --> 368.62]  because that's what image bearers do.
[370.10 --> 373.10]  You look, they look like God.
[373.10 --> 375.26]  In other words,
[375.76 --> 377.08]  we've been called,
[377.72 --> 378.86]  we've been chosen
[378.86 --> 381.12]  to be the sons,
[381.30 --> 382.66]  the chosen sons and daughters
[382.66 --> 383.78]  of God
[383.78 --> 384.94]  who have been given insight
[384.94 --> 385.96]  about Jesus.
[386.46 --> 387.56]  Our calling
[387.56 --> 389.46]  is an identity
[389.46 --> 391.46]  in Christ.
[391.46 --> 394.64]  And in the context of Ephesians,
[394.76 --> 395.74]  being in Jesus
[395.74 --> 397.42]  means at the end of chapter one
[397.42 --> 399.54]  to be the fullness of him
[399.54 --> 401.96]  who fills everything
[401.96 --> 403.18]  in every way.
[404.84 --> 406.32]  As the body of Christ,
[406.46 --> 407.86]  we are called to be
[407.86 --> 409.88]  the fullness of Jesus,
[410.10 --> 412.06]  of him who fills everything
[412.06 --> 413.14]  in every way.
[413.24 --> 414.46]  The fullness of Christ
[414.46 --> 416.06]  filled to the brim
[416.06 --> 417.02]  with Jesus,
[417.20 --> 419.36]  full up with Jesus.
[419.36 --> 419.60]  Jesus.
[421.48 --> 422.64]  Think about that.
[425.38 --> 425.90]  Wow.
[427.76 --> 429.26]  Filled to the brim
[429.26 --> 430.48]  with Jesus.
[431.64 --> 432.96]  That is our calling.
[433.90 --> 434.48]  It's why he says
[434.48 --> 435.56]  at the end of chapter two,
[435.96 --> 436.52]  and in him,
[436.62 --> 438.16]  you too are being built together
[438.16 --> 439.36]  to become a dwelling
[439.36 --> 441.92]  in which God's spirit lives.
[443.04 --> 443.92]  And then at the end
[443.92 --> 444.58]  of chapter three,
[444.70 --> 445.06]  Paul says,
[445.18 --> 446.26]  I pray that you may be
[446.26 --> 447.48]  filled to the measure
[447.48 --> 449.38]  of the fullness of God.
[451.50 --> 452.64]  Our calling
[452.64 --> 454.04]  is to be filled
[454.04 --> 455.40]  with Christ
[455.40 --> 457.34]  in him
[457.34 --> 458.84]  and he in us.
[460.92 --> 462.10]  Now, says Paul,
[462.76 --> 463.80]  live a life
[463.80 --> 464.84]  worthy
[464.84 --> 466.30]  of that calling.
[468.36 --> 469.30]  Live a life
[469.30 --> 469.98]  worthy
[469.98 --> 471.30]  of that calling.
[471.48 --> 473.22]  You cannot live that life
[473.22 --> 474.56]  if you have not first
[474.56 --> 475.76]  identified yourself
[475.76 --> 477.00]  with that calling.
[478.78 --> 479.90]  So we need to stop
[479.90 --> 480.82]  thinking about calling
[480.82 --> 482.22]  as a doing thing
[482.22 --> 484.04]  and rather
[484.04 --> 485.22]  as a being thing.
[485.98 --> 487.20]  You are called.
[487.68 --> 488.80]  You don't do called.
[488.88 --> 489.70]  I have a calling.
[489.82 --> 491.06]  I don't do a calling.
[492.72 --> 494.00]  Because if you don't know
[494.00 --> 495.08]  or realize the calling,
[495.38 --> 495.92]  if I don't know
[495.92 --> 497.02]  or realize the calling
[497.02 --> 497.66]  that's on my life,
[497.72 --> 498.80]  I'm not going to live into it.
[499.42 --> 500.34]  If I interview
[500.34 --> 501.42]  and I get hired on
[501.42 --> 502.46]  for some company,
[502.60 --> 503.64]  for some sort of position,
[503.64 --> 504.40]  but I don't know
[504.40 --> 506.00]  what job I've been hired on for,
[506.30 --> 507.24]  I'm not really going to know
[507.24 --> 508.24]  what to do with my time.
[510.66 --> 511.86]  Live a life
[511.86 --> 513.38]  worthy of the calling
[513.38 --> 514.74]  that you have received.
[514.88 --> 516.26]  You've already gotten it,
[516.34 --> 517.02]  in other words.
[517.62 --> 518.28]  Live a life
[518.28 --> 520.18]  worthy of that calling.
[520.88 --> 521.60]  Paul's told us
[521.60 --> 522.66]  this position
[522.66 --> 523.76]  that we've received,
[523.88 --> 524.86]  so now he's giving us
[524.86 --> 526.40]  a little bit of a job description
[526.40 --> 527.08]  for us.
[527.98 --> 529.52]  He gives two main responsibilities
[529.52 --> 530.34]  for the church
[530.34 --> 532.38]  in order to live this life
[532.38 --> 533.58]  and live this life
[533.58 --> 534.62]  worthily of the calling.
[534.82 --> 535.40]  Both of which,
[535.58 --> 536.50]  both of these responsibilities
[536.50 --> 537.72]  are deeply connected
[537.72 --> 538.60]  to that calling.
[539.12 --> 540.54]  The first being unity
[540.54 --> 542.20]  and the second,
[542.64 --> 543.06]  maturity.
[545.18 --> 546.08]  Verses two to three,
[546.24 --> 547.48]  be completely humble
[547.48 --> 548.46]  and gentle, he says.
[548.54 --> 549.18]  Be patient,
[549.62 --> 550.48]  bearing with one another
[550.48 --> 551.04]  in love.
[551.56 --> 552.98]  Make every effort
[552.98 --> 555.12]  to keep the unity
[555.12 --> 555.84]  of the spirit
[555.84 --> 556.62]  through the bond
[556.62 --> 557.64]  of peace.
[557.64 --> 560.84]  make every effort,
[560.92 --> 561.18]  he says.
[561.24 --> 562.12]  See, there's an urgency
[562.12 --> 563.10]  in his words, right?
[563.24 --> 564.74]  It implies that unity
[564.74 --> 566.32]  is one of the key ways
[566.32 --> 567.96]  that we live out
[567.96 --> 569.02]  our great calling
[569.02 --> 569.74]  in Christ,
[569.84 --> 571.56]  a way that presumes
[571.56 --> 572.46]  humility
[572.46 --> 573.60]  and gentleness
[573.60 --> 574.46]  and love
[574.46 --> 575.24]  and patience.
[575.36 --> 576.76]  You can't pursue unity
[576.76 --> 578.02]  if you don't have
[578.02 --> 579.76]  those things, right?
[581.46 --> 582.88]  Make every effort.
[583.16 --> 584.64]  Spare no effort
[584.64 --> 585.34]  is another way
[585.34 --> 585.90]  of putting it.
[585.90 --> 587.10]  Do everything
[587.10 --> 588.24]  you possibly can.
[588.38 --> 588.60]  Why?
[589.10 --> 590.02]  Because the spirit
[590.02 --> 590.58]  of Jesus
[590.58 --> 592.48]  is the bond
[592.48 --> 593.20]  or the adhesive
[593.20 --> 594.44]  for that unity.
[596.34 --> 597.30]  The spirit
[597.30 --> 598.50]  was given to us,
[598.54 --> 599.24]  in other words,
[599.46 --> 600.72]  to be the glue
[600.72 --> 602.18]  that holds us together.
[602.34 --> 603.04]  It's the adhesive
[603.04 --> 603.96]  for the unity
[603.96 --> 604.60]  of the body.
[605.30 --> 605.82]  And if you actually
[605.82 --> 606.42]  look at that word
[606.42 --> 606.98]  for spirit,
[607.18 --> 608.12]  in both the Greek
[608.12 --> 608.70]  and the Hebrew,
[609.04 --> 609.98]  it's the same word
[609.98 --> 610.68]  for breath.
[612.08 --> 613.46]  So the implication here
[613.46 --> 615.00]  is unless the breath
[615.00 --> 616.10]  is within the body,
[617.10 --> 618.34]  the body cannot
[618.34 --> 619.10]  hold together.
[620.36 --> 621.62]  Unless the breath
[621.62 --> 622.76]  is within the body,
[623.50 --> 624.60]  the body is dead.
[626.48 --> 627.66]  The spirit is what
[627.66 --> 628.58]  holds us together
[628.58 --> 629.66]  as a church
[629.66 --> 630.60]  and gives us life.
[631.16 --> 631.80]  And so when we
[631.80 --> 633.14]  find ways,
[633.20 --> 634.94]  when we manufacture ways,
[635.00 --> 635.66]  we seek ways
[635.66 --> 637.58]  to pull that bond apart,
[638.26 --> 638.94]  to sort of
[638.94 --> 640.04]  unstickify ourselves
[640.04 --> 640.84]  from one another,
[640.84 --> 642.62]  we are sucking
[642.62 --> 644.10]  the life-giving spirit,
[644.38 --> 645.64]  the life-giving breath
[645.64 --> 646.16]  of Jesus
[646.16 --> 647.56]  right out of us.
[649.26 --> 650.12]  It's like pulling
[650.12 --> 650.60]  the thread
[650.60 --> 651.82]  out of all your clothes.
[652.28 --> 652.68]  Eventually,
[652.92 --> 653.68]  the cloth isn't going
[653.68 --> 654.68]  to stick together anymore
[654.68 --> 655.30]  and you're just going
[655.30 --> 655.82]  to have a blob
[655.82 --> 656.86]  of fabric on the ground.
[658.84 --> 660.50]  Make every effort
[660.50 --> 662.76]  to keep the unity
[662.76 --> 663.50]  of the spirit
[663.50 --> 664.88]  through the bond
[664.88 --> 665.32]  of peace.
[665.32 --> 666.94]  This has huge implications
[666.94 --> 669.00]  for whenever we are,
[669.64 --> 670.86]  and whenever we see it,
[671.00 --> 671.94]  whether it's in our own church
[671.94 --> 672.64]  or in other churches,
[673.14 --> 673.84]  whenever we are
[673.84 --> 674.92]  actively allowing
[674.92 --> 677.18]  division and quarreling
[677.18 --> 678.38]  to go on
[678.38 --> 679.42]  within our communities,
[679.54 --> 680.18]  to go on inside
[680.18 --> 680.84]  of our communities
[680.84 --> 681.52]  because we are
[681.52 --> 682.64]  actively destroying
[682.64 --> 683.80]  the witness
[683.80 --> 684.66]  of the Holy Spirit.
[686.20 --> 687.42]  When you really
[687.42 --> 688.04]  think about it,
[688.08 --> 689.46]  it should be unthinkable
[689.46 --> 690.92]  that we would
[690.92 --> 691.90]  ever allow
[691.90 --> 693.38]  or ever intentionally
[693.38 --> 695.14]  divide the body
[695.14 --> 696.00]  that is meant
[696.00 --> 696.94]  to be the fullness
[696.94 --> 697.62]  of Jesus.
[701.66 --> 702.44]  This doesn't,
[702.54 --> 704.54]  this doesn't mean
[704.54 --> 705.08]  that we can't
[705.08 --> 706.20]  occasionally think differently,
[706.38 --> 706.52]  okay?
[706.56 --> 707.36]  Don't hear me wrong.
[708.04 --> 709.22]  Unity does not mean
[709.22 --> 710.04]  uniformity
[710.04 --> 711.08]  as if we all need
[711.08 --> 711.76]  to think and act
[711.76 --> 712.42]  exactly the same.
[712.52 --> 712.92]  Heaven forbid,
[712.98 --> 713.66]  that would be terrible.
[714.78 --> 716.32]  But we cannot condone
[716.32 --> 718.76]  things like rivalries
[718.76 --> 720.14]  within the body of Christ.
[721.02 --> 722.14]  We cannot condone
[722.14 --> 723.64]  things like conflicts
[723.64 --> 724.52]  that have been allowed
[724.52 --> 725.70]  to fester for months
[725.70 --> 726.54]  for years,
[726.96 --> 728.00]  bitterness and grudges
[728.00 --> 729.14]  that are poison,
[730.14 --> 731.10]  utter poison
[731.10 --> 732.66]  for the body of Christ.
[733.82 --> 735.86]  The church cannot breathe
[735.86 --> 737.38]  with Holy Spirit life
[737.38 --> 739.04]  in such conditions.
[739.04 --> 744.36]  but we are just so terribly
[744.36 --> 745.30]  over-sensitive
[745.30 --> 746.30]  about everything,
[746.30 --> 746.78]  right?
[747.92 --> 748.80]  We take ourselves
[748.80 --> 749.94]  so seriously.
[750.28 --> 751.98]  We dramatize everything
[751.98 --> 752.74]  and it's actually,
[752.88 --> 754.42]  that's actually a cultural value
[754.42 --> 755.12]  that has snuck
[755.12 --> 755.76]  into the church,
[755.82 --> 756.08]  you know?
[756.52 --> 757.94]  The fact that we can't
[757.94 --> 758.66]  even converse
[758.66 --> 759.20]  with each other
[759.20 --> 759.76]  well anymore.
[760.34 --> 761.48]  The fact that we can't
[761.48 --> 763.54]  have whimsical conversations
[763.54 --> 765.16]  and appropriately gentle
[765.16 --> 766.40]  dialogue with each other.
[766.40 --> 768.12]  That's a cultural value
[768.12 --> 769.26]  that has seeped itself
[769.26 --> 770.00]  into the church.
[770.48 --> 771.58]  We really all should be
[771.58 --> 772.74]  professional diplomats.
[773.64 --> 774.54]  Don't get me wrong,
[774.62 --> 775.06]  I know,
[775.38 --> 776.86]  it's okay that we sometimes
[776.86 --> 777.44]  think differently,
[777.66 --> 778.78]  but we really should all
[778.78 --> 780.04]  be professional diplomats.
[780.50 --> 780.82]  Why?
[781.78 --> 782.96]  Because according to Paul,
[783.34 --> 784.86]  the oneness of the body
[784.86 --> 786.70]  reflects the oneness
[786.70 --> 787.54]  of God.
[789.60 --> 790.62]  Verse 4 to 5,
[790.62 --> 790.90]  look,
[791.26 --> 792.22]  there is one body
[792.22 --> 793.02]  and one spirit,
[793.72 --> 794.78]  just as you were called
[794.78 --> 795.42]  to the one hope
[795.42 --> 796.08]  when you were called.
[796.48 --> 796.98]  One Lord,
[797.32 --> 797.82]  one faith,
[798.06 --> 798.68]  one baptism,
[798.98 --> 800.24]  one God and Father over all
[800.24 --> 800.90]  who is over all
[800.90 --> 801.48]  and through all
[801.48 --> 802.04]  and in all.
[802.10 --> 802.90]  Do you get his point?
[804.18 --> 805.12]  John Stott said this,
[805.18 --> 806.04]  if there is there
[806.04 --> 806.90]  only one God,
[807.88 --> 808.96]  then he's only got one church.
[810.54 --> 812.34]  Is the unity of God inviolable?
[812.70 --> 813.84]  Then so is the unity
[813.84 --> 814.42]  of the church.
[815.40 --> 817.14]  The unity of the church
[817.14 --> 818.80]  is as indestructible
[818.80 --> 821.50]  as the unity of God himself.
[824.50 --> 826.36]  Paul is tasking us
[826.36 --> 827.38]  in this passage
[827.38 --> 829.86]  to make every effort,
[830.26 --> 831.66]  try as stinking hard
[831.66 --> 832.38]  as you can
[832.38 --> 834.60]  to remember your calling.
[835.76 --> 838.22]  Remember our common purpose
[838.22 --> 839.16]  in Christ
[839.16 --> 840.84]  to reflect the truth
[840.84 --> 842.22]  that there is one Lord,
[842.72 --> 843.58]  one faith,
[844.14 --> 844.86]  one baptism,
[845.56 --> 846.64]  one, one, one, one, one.
[847.14 --> 848.28]  Now don't get me wrong.
[848.98 --> 850.22]  I know what you're all thinking.
[851.16 --> 852.42]  We suck at this.
[853.30 --> 853.82]  Right?
[854.50 --> 855.68]  I know, I know you're all thinking.
[855.74 --> 856.88]  We're terrible at this.
[857.42 --> 858.06]  We're terrible.
[858.80 --> 859.72]  Reading through church history
[859.72 --> 861.14]  is one of the most depressing things
[861.14 --> 861.98]  that you can ever do.
[863.20 --> 864.56]  We're just terrible.
[864.68 --> 865.96]  It has been a horrible witness
[865.96 --> 866.92]  to the world
[866.92 --> 867.92]  that we have
[867.92 --> 869.62]  so many divided churches.
[871.08 --> 872.30]  Churches that have split.
[873.16 --> 874.68]  Families that have been torn apart.
[875.02 --> 875.52]  Church leaders
[875.52 --> 876.94]  that have created polarizations
[876.94 --> 877.74]  within the body.
[878.36 --> 878.96]  You know, I remember
[878.96 --> 880.68]  doing a semester in Grand Rapids
[880.68 --> 882.92]  and a few of us
[882.92 --> 883.70]  would be driving around
[883.70 --> 884.28]  and I remember
[884.28 --> 885.66]  we were so shocked
[885.66 --> 887.22]  at the number of times
[887.22 --> 887.98]  that you would come
[887.98 --> 888.70]  to an intersection
[888.70 --> 889.74]  and there were two,
[889.86 --> 891.02]  maybe even three churches,
[891.20 --> 892.40]  kitty corner from one another
[892.40 --> 893.98]  at the same intersection.
[894.50 --> 896.04]  It's all over the place.
[896.38 --> 897.62]  And it was so sad to us,
[897.68 --> 898.52]  especially coming out of
[898.52 --> 900.10]  a secular Vancouver
[900.10 --> 901.18]  kind of context.
[901.18 --> 904.30]  And yet,
[904.52 --> 905.44]  on the flip side,
[906.00 --> 907.08]  my husband Danny and I
[907.08 --> 908.02]  recently moved into
[908.02 --> 908.84]  South Coquitlam
[908.84 --> 910.84]  and I've been pleasantly surprised
[910.84 --> 912.80]  that there are so many churches
[912.80 --> 913.58]  in Coquitlam.
[915.44 --> 916.28]  In this case,
[916.40 --> 917.64]  it's a good thing.
[918.12 --> 919.52]  I've seen it as a good thing.
[919.58 --> 920.90]  It's a good thing that we have
[920.90 --> 923.26]  so many pockets of communities
[923.26 --> 924.68]  worshiping together,
[924.82 --> 926.44]  so many different expressions
[926.44 --> 927.62]  of the body of Christ
[927.62 --> 929.44]  that can invite nearby neighbors
[929.44 --> 930.76]  to come in, right?
[930.80 --> 931.62]  You don't want to be inviting
[931.62 --> 932.24]  someone to church
[932.24 --> 933.50]  who lives 45 minutes away.
[933.78 --> 934.92]  It's a good thing
[934.92 --> 936.44]  to have multiple churches
[936.44 --> 938.22]  in multiple pockets of a city.
[939.42 --> 940.92]  The number, in other words,
[940.98 --> 941.72]  what I want to say here
[941.72 --> 943.32]  is that the number of churches
[943.32 --> 944.74]  that we have
[944.74 --> 948.54]  can be and is actually a strength
[948.54 --> 951.52]  provided that we learn
[951.52 --> 952.96]  how to speak well
[952.96 --> 953.88]  about one another.
[955.76 --> 957.32]  Provided that we learn
[957.32 --> 958.24]  how to speak well
[958.24 --> 958.84]  about one another
[958.84 --> 959.96]  and to work together
[959.96 --> 961.30]  as one body
[961.30 --> 962.56]  under Jesus Christ.
[963.42 --> 965.26]  See, the stain on the church
[965.26 --> 966.66]  is not that we have
[966.66 --> 967.84]  so many different churches.
[969.30 --> 971.30]  The stain on the church
[971.30 --> 974.14]  is that these churches
[974.14 --> 976.50]  or is how these churches
[976.50 --> 977.64]  have spoken to
[977.64 --> 978.68]  and about one another.
[979.84 --> 980.84]  That's the stain.
[981.16 --> 981.78]  It's not that we have
[981.78 --> 982.58]  so many different churches.
[982.76 --> 983.74]  It's how we've spoken
[983.74 --> 985.58]  about and to one another.
[985.58 --> 987.48]  how we've failed
[987.48 --> 988.60]  to partner with
[988.60 --> 989.76]  and pray for one another
[989.76 --> 990.76]  and instead have only
[990.76 --> 991.90]  emphasized our differences.
[995.28 --> 996.18]  While I was studying
[996.18 --> 996.60]  at Regent,
[996.74 --> 998.64]  there was an Eastern Orthodox priest
[998.64 --> 999.48]  who came to speak
[999.48 --> 1000.30]  to one of our classes
[1000.30 --> 1001.76]  and he came to share with us
[1001.76 --> 1003.18]  about what makes
[1003.18 --> 1004.00]  the Eastern Orthodox
[1004.00 --> 1005.32]  the Eastern Orthodox Church.
[1005.56 --> 1005.74]  You know,
[1005.84 --> 1006.80]  what's it all about?
[1007.62 --> 1008.38]  But he started
[1008.38 --> 1009.12]  with this statement
[1009.12 --> 1011.02]  and I've never forgotten this.
[1011.02 --> 1012.14]  He said,
[1012.64 --> 1014.02]  we must always remember
[1014.02 --> 1015.72]  that our similarities
[1015.72 --> 1017.64]  far outweigh our differences.
[1019.42 --> 1020.36]  In other words,
[1020.50 --> 1021.74]  what unifies us
[1021.74 --> 1023.58]  is far more significant
[1023.58 --> 1025.28]  than what divides us.
[1027.44 --> 1029.42]  There is one body,
[1029.70 --> 1030.14]  says Paul,
[1030.92 --> 1031.96]  one spirit,
[1032.48 --> 1033.04]  one hope,
[1033.46 --> 1034.04]  one Lord,
[1034.48 --> 1035.08]  one faith,
[1035.42 --> 1036.06]  one baptism,
[1036.46 --> 1036.96]  one God,
[1037.18 --> 1037.66]  one, one,
[1037.76 --> 1038.52]  one, one, one.
[1038.52 --> 1040.74]  You know,
[1040.80 --> 1042.74]  it is so strange
[1042.74 --> 1044.50]  that there have been
[1044.50 --> 1045.72]  so many debates
[1045.72 --> 1047.46]  over how the Trinity
[1047.46 --> 1049.08]  can be three in one,
[1049.72 --> 1051.18]  how the triune God
[1051.18 --> 1052.56]  can be three persons in one,
[1052.92 --> 1054.16]  and yet nobody seems to care
[1054.16 --> 1055.26]  about how Paul's mentioned
[1055.26 --> 1056.84]  that millions of believers
[1056.84 --> 1058.32]  are supposed to be one.
[1059.76 --> 1061.26]  How's that supposed to happen?
[1062.52 --> 1063.86]  Every single person
[1063.86 --> 1065.20]  who has believed
[1065.20 --> 1066.28]  in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1066.28 --> 1067.18]  and has given up
[1067.18 --> 1068.38]  everything for him
[1068.38 --> 1071.24]  is a part of his one body.
[1072.70 --> 1074.28]  And in verses 7 through 10,
[1074.74 --> 1075.46]  Paul now takes us
[1075.46 --> 1076.40]  one step further
[1076.40 --> 1077.76]  and explains how
[1077.76 --> 1079.10]  this unified body
[1079.10 --> 1080.72]  is meant to look.
[1081.70 --> 1082.88]  So we're shifting now
[1082.88 --> 1085.12]  from unity into maturity.
[1085.30 --> 1086.58]  This is his transition point.
[1087.52 --> 1088.90]  He quotes from Psalm 68.
[1089.16 --> 1090.52]  It's a bit of an obscure passage,
[1090.94 --> 1092.64]  but he's quoting from Psalm 68,
[1093.04 --> 1094.44]  and there is a slight adjustment
[1094.44 --> 1095.14]  in the text here
[1095.14 --> 1095.98]  that I can't get into,
[1095.98 --> 1097.64]  but what he's doing here
[1097.64 --> 1098.72]  is he's pressing the point
[1098.72 --> 1101.38]  that this is a God
[1101.38 --> 1103.20]  who gives gifts to his people.
[1104.26 --> 1106.30]  So the context of Psalm 68
[1106.30 --> 1108.40]  is of a heroic, mighty God,
[1108.64 --> 1110.48]  a mighty Yahweh in battle,
[1110.90 --> 1111.92]  scattering his enemies,
[1112.60 --> 1114.16]  being a father to the fatherless.
[1114.26 --> 1115.06]  All of the other nations
[1115.06 --> 1116.00]  are looking in envy
[1116.00 --> 1117.06]  at the mountain of God,
[1117.06 --> 1118.74]  and when God ascends
[1118.74 --> 1119.58]  to his mountain,
[1120.42 --> 1121.64]  things happen.
[1122.76 --> 1124.76]  The nations come to him.
[1125.04 --> 1126.56]  The world becomes his
[1126.56 --> 1128.66]  and he gives gifts to his people.
[1131.06 --> 1133.22]  Paul now takes that Psalm
[1133.22 --> 1135.14]  and applies it to Jesus.
[1137.70 --> 1140.08]  Because 40 days after his resurrection,
[1141.34 --> 1142.68]  Jesus is now the one
[1142.68 --> 1144.38]  who's ascending on high.
[1144.38 --> 1144.70]  Right?
[1145.36 --> 1147.26]  Not only did God descend to earth,
[1147.40 --> 1149.16]  Paul's saying that God also now
[1149.16 --> 1150.52]  ascended on high in Jesus
[1150.52 --> 1151.72]  to fill the whole earth.
[1152.78 --> 1154.72]  As C. Leslie Minton has put it,
[1154.94 --> 1156.42]  there is now no part of the universe
[1156.42 --> 1158.18]  where Christ is not.
[1159.04 --> 1159.62]  In other words,
[1159.76 --> 1160.58]  when Christ ascended,
[1160.68 --> 1161.72]  he didn't leave the earth.
[1163.10 --> 1164.96]  He's not deserted the earth.
[1165.90 --> 1166.88]  He's filling it.
[1168.16 --> 1169.44]  And according to Paul,
[1170.06 --> 1172.16]  he's filling it through the church.
[1172.16 --> 1174.16]  How?
[1175.78 --> 1178.16]  Well, as the ascended Lord on high,
[1179.36 --> 1181.82]  Jesus can now give gifts
[1181.82 --> 1182.96]  to his people.
[1184.96 --> 1186.54]  For the sake of unity.
[1186.96 --> 1187.42]  Verse 11,
[1187.52 --> 1188.22]  he gave apostles,
[1188.54 --> 1189.54]  prophets, evangelists,
[1189.68 --> 1190.38]  pastors, teachers,
[1190.82 --> 1191.66]  people, in other words,
[1191.82 --> 1193.06]  with leadership gifts
[1193.06 --> 1195.10]  who can equip the church
[1195.10 --> 1197.46]  for the service of the church
[1197.46 --> 1198.72]  so that it can be built up.
[1199.40 --> 1201.08]  Until, says Paul in verse 13,
[1201.08 --> 1203.70]  until we all reach unity in the faith
[1203.70 --> 1205.58]  and in the knowledge of the Son of God
[1205.58 --> 1206.94]  and become mature.
[1208.84 --> 1210.26]  Become mature.
[1210.72 --> 1212.54]  Attaining to the whole measure
[1212.54 --> 1213.98]  of the fullness of Christ.
[1214.44 --> 1217.70]  Until we become mature.
[1218.60 --> 1220.72]  Until we reach maturity
[1220.72 --> 1222.06]  and become mature.
[1222.44 --> 1224.06]  That's Paul's subtle way of saying,
[1224.20 --> 1225.42]  yeah, we're not there yet, folks.
[1225.42 --> 1227.76]  We're not there yet.
[1227.92 --> 1230.20]  We haven't yet grown into maturity
[1230.20 --> 1231.10]  because when we do,
[1231.66 --> 1232.26]  we'll know.
[1234.08 --> 1236.30]  We'll know when we've reached maturity
[1236.30 --> 1237.58]  because then the whole measure
[1237.58 --> 1238.32]  of Christ's fullness
[1238.32 --> 1240.12]  will be evident in us.
[1241.10 --> 1242.18]  That's the goal.
[1243.04 --> 1244.88]  That's what we're seeking to achieve.
[1245.64 --> 1248.02]  That the whole measure of Christ's fullness
[1248.02 --> 1249.38]  would be evident in us.
[1249.94 --> 1251.08]  Paul's prayer for the church
[1251.08 --> 1253.36]  is to become so matured in Jesus
[1253.36 --> 1255.84]  that Jesus becomes the heartbeat
[1255.84 --> 1256.86]  of our existence.
[1257.74 --> 1259.12]  Where the presence of Jesus
[1259.12 --> 1261.80]  is so deeply permeated into us
[1261.80 --> 1263.72]  that there's no separation anymore.
[1264.50 --> 1266.36]  There's complete unity
[1266.36 --> 1268.52]  between the head and the body.
[1270.62 --> 1271.72]  Then, says Paul,
[1271.80 --> 1273.32]  we'll no longer be infants
[1273.32 --> 1275.18]  tossed and thrown about
[1275.18 --> 1277.12]  by every new fashion of Christianity
[1277.12 --> 1278.96]  and every new wave of theology
[1278.96 --> 1279.86]  that comes along,
[1280.26 --> 1281.24]  every wind of teaching,
[1281.58 --> 1282.26]  which he's implying
[1282.26 --> 1283.86]  is a sign of immaturity.
[1284.90 --> 1286.30]  That's a sign of immaturity.
[1288.02 --> 1289.50]  Instead, he says in verse 15,
[1289.88 --> 1290.96]  speaking the truth in love
[1290.96 --> 1292.34]  will grow to become
[1292.34 --> 1293.16]  in every respect
[1293.16 --> 1295.06]  the mature body
[1295.06 --> 1296.82]  of him who is the head.
[1297.38 --> 1298.84]  The mature body of Christ.
[1299.68 --> 1300.28]  From him,
[1300.70 --> 1301.58]  the whole body
[1301.58 --> 1302.72]  joined and held together,
[1302.88 --> 1303.92]  unified in other words,
[1304.52 --> 1305.26]  joined and held together
[1305.26 --> 1306.56]  by every supporting ligament,
[1306.56 --> 1309.38]  grows and builds itself up in love
[1309.38 --> 1311.94]  as each part does its work.
[1314.90 --> 1315.58]  We have,
[1315.80 --> 1316.72]  Danny and I have friends right now
[1316.72 --> 1318.02]  who have a seven-month-old baby
[1318.02 --> 1319.80]  who's still learning how to,
[1319.88 --> 1321.76]  he's mostly just lying on his stomach now,
[1321.80 --> 1322.32]  he's still learning
[1322.32 --> 1323.68]  how to kind of sit up by himself.
[1324.24 --> 1325.34]  Eventually, he'll figure it out.
[1326.06 --> 1327.20]  But imagine if
[1327.20 --> 1329.32]  he was continually trying to sit up
[1329.32 --> 1330.56]  without ever using his hands.
[1331.44 --> 1332.72]  As if he just didn't realize
[1332.72 --> 1333.52]  that he had hands.
[1333.52 --> 1336.56]  He'd be stuck, right?
[1337.02 --> 1338.28]  The poor guy would probably crawl
[1338.28 --> 1339.20]  for the rest of his life.
[1341.54 --> 1342.78]  That's what Paul's worried about
[1342.78 --> 1343.42]  for the church.
[1345.16 --> 1346.28]  The body of Jesus
[1346.28 --> 1348.38]  is made up of many members,
[1348.66 --> 1349.64]  many different parts,
[1349.90 --> 1351.22]  and the church matures
[1351.22 --> 1354.02]  when each part does its work.
[1354.86 --> 1356.62]  Just like any other human body,
[1357.08 --> 1357.32]  right?
[1357.32 --> 1358.24]  When you think about
[1358.24 --> 1359.08]  all the different digits
[1359.08 --> 1360.22]  and pieces of your body,
[1360.44 --> 1361.86]  how complicated that is,
[1362.26 --> 1363.14]  but how it's all meant
[1363.14 --> 1363.98]  to work together
[1363.98 --> 1365.26]  so that the body can function,
[1365.48 --> 1366.80]  that's what he's thinking of.
[1367.38 --> 1369.28]  If there are body members,
[1369.64 --> 1371.52]  legs, knees, eyes, toes, whatever,
[1371.66 --> 1373.12]  that aren't being used,
[1374.22 --> 1375.54]  the church is going to walk
[1375.54 --> 1376.44]  with a limp.
[1377.58 --> 1379.96]  Or it's not going to listen very well.
[1380.42 --> 1381.74]  Or it's going to be all talk
[1381.74 --> 1382.48]  and no action.
[1382.48 --> 1387.52]  Unity and maturity,
[1387.68 --> 1388.16]  in other words,
[1388.24 --> 1389.26]  go hand in hand
[1389.26 --> 1390.54]  in Christ's body.
[1391.82 --> 1393.48]  This is how the body grows
[1393.48 --> 1394.30]  and matures.
[1394.92 --> 1396.18]  The communities that thrive
[1396.18 --> 1397.70]  are the ones that empower
[1397.70 --> 1398.38]  their people
[1398.38 --> 1399.86]  to do the work of ministry,
[1400.36 --> 1402.26]  where each and every member
[1402.26 --> 1403.20]  has value,
[1403.70 --> 1405.18]  has something to offer,
[1405.68 --> 1406.84]  has giftings to use.
[1406.92 --> 1407.96]  Each member has a means
[1407.96 --> 1409.50]  by which they can live out
[1409.50 --> 1410.42]  that calling
[1410.42 --> 1412.26]  that Paul has called us to be
[1412.26 --> 1413.02]  and to live into,
[1413.12 --> 1414.46]  which is as a chosen son
[1414.46 --> 1415.80]  or daughter of God.
[1418.16 --> 1418.68]  And yes,
[1418.86 --> 1419.12]  you know,
[1419.20 --> 1420.06]  specific giftings
[1420.06 --> 1421.08]  are mentioned here,
[1421.28 --> 1422.58]  but only to highlight
[1422.58 --> 1423.34]  those gifts
[1423.34 --> 1424.96]  that are meant to then empower
[1424.96 --> 1425.56]  and encourage
[1425.56 --> 1426.34]  the other gifts.
[1426.90 --> 1427.14]  Right?
[1427.40 --> 1428.58]  All of these giftings
[1428.58 --> 1429.40]  that he's mentioned
[1429.40 --> 1430.48]  are people that are
[1430.48 --> 1431.10]  in positions
[1431.10 --> 1432.20]  that can encourage
[1432.20 --> 1432.94]  the other gifts
[1432.94 --> 1434.10]  of the body to be used.
[1434.38 --> 1435.78]  To encourage the people
[1435.78 --> 1436.64]  towards ministry,
[1436.74 --> 1437.74]  not to do it for them.
[1439.72 --> 1441.80]  The body can only be healthy
[1441.80 --> 1444.52]  when every part of the body
[1444.52 --> 1446.16]  is doing its work,
[1446.70 --> 1449.82]  is doing that connecting work,
[1450.48 --> 1451.64]  working as one,
[1451.82 --> 1452.98]  moving by the breath
[1452.98 --> 1454.06]  of the Holy Spirit
[1454.06 --> 1455.98]  and under the control
[1455.98 --> 1456.64]  of the head.
[1458.24 --> 1459.42]  As Barclay puts it,
[1459.50 --> 1460.54]  no brain can work
[1460.54 --> 1461.16]  through a body
[1461.16 --> 1462.28]  which is disintegrated
[1462.28 --> 1463.24]  and uncoordinated
[1463.24 --> 1464.38]  and split into fragments.
[1464.38 --> 1467.42]  And really,
[1467.52 --> 1468.26]  when you think about it,
[1469.02 --> 1471.44]  how often does a lack of unity,
[1471.62 --> 1472.78]  how often does conflict
[1472.78 --> 1473.84]  arise in our churches
[1473.84 --> 1475.36]  when a gift
[1475.36 --> 1476.46]  is not being used?
[1477.66 --> 1479.14]  Or it's being used
[1479.14 --> 1479.48]  in a way
[1479.48 --> 1481.36]  that's perhaps misplaced?
[1482.44 --> 1483.66]  When you really think about it,
[1484.18 --> 1485.34]  how often does it actually
[1485.34 --> 1486.80]  boil down to something like that?
[1488.74 --> 1489.18]  Alternatively,
[1489.38 --> 1490.28]  how amazing is it
[1490.28 --> 1491.34]  when you feel like
[1491.34 --> 1491.86]  you have something
[1491.86 --> 1492.64]  to offer to a church
[1492.64 --> 1493.66]  and someone comes up to you
[1493.66 --> 1493.92]  and says,
[1494.00 --> 1494.94]  hey, I see this in you.
[1496.16 --> 1497.08]  Hey, I think you're gifted
[1497.08 --> 1497.72]  in this way.
[1499.08 --> 1500.10]  It's like breathing
[1500.10 --> 1501.18]  the life of the Spirit
[1501.18 --> 1502.58]  right into their dry bones
[1502.58 --> 1503.86]  and bringing them to life, right?
[1504.34 --> 1505.36]  Because they have value.
[1506.18 --> 1507.44]  They have something to offer.
[1507.56 --> 1508.68]  They have something to give.
[1509.66 --> 1510.42]  There are people
[1510.42 --> 1511.30]  in this church
[1511.30 --> 1512.56]  and in every church
[1512.56 --> 1514.34]  who have gifts
[1514.34 --> 1515.74]  but have no avenues
[1515.74 --> 1516.20]  right now
[1516.20 --> 1517.10]  by which to use them.
[1517.10 --> 1521.06]  And as the church
[1521.06 --> 1522.82]  of the great giver of gifts,
[1523.46 --> 1525.58]  we have to be willing
[1525.58 --> 1527.12]  to be creative
[1527.12 --> 1528.50]  and to find new ways
[1528.50 --> 1529.64]  of allowing the members
[1529.64 --> 1530.92]  of his body to function.
[1533.10 --> 1535.08]  Our inclination, again,
[1535.18 --> 1536.12]  is always to take ourselves
[1536.12 --> 1536.74]  so seriously
[1536.74 --> 1537.82]  but we really don't take
[1537.82 --> 1539.52]  each other seriously enough.
[1541.50 --> 1542.74]  Just like we take
[1542.74 --> 1543.84]  our own bodies for granted,
[1543.96 --> 1545.12]  we can very easily
[1545.12 --> 1546.38]  take one another for granted.
[1547.84 --> 1549.82]  I seriously need to consider
[1549.82 --> 1550.86]  how you're gifted.
[1552.34 --> 1554.32]  I seriously need to consider
[1554.32 --> 1556.48]  the ways that Jesus wants you
[1556.48 --> 1558.06]  to function in his body.
[1558.98 --> 1560.52]  I seriously need to consider
[1560.52 --> 1561.96]  the ways that my gifts
[1561.96 --> 1563.28]  can align up with yours
[1563.28 --> 1564.74]  and we can create something new
[1564.74 --> 1565.88]  by which we can build
[1565.88 --> 1567.30]  more avenues for people
[1567.30 --> 1568.42]  to use their gifts
[1568.42 --> 1569.36]  in the church
[1569.36 --> 1570.96]  for growth and development
[1570.96 --> 1571.86]  for the whole community.
[1573.04 --> 1574.52]  Because when we help
[1574.52 --> 1575.82]  one person to flourish,
[1575.82 --> 1578.26]  everyone feels
[1578.26 --> 1579.20]  the effects of that.
[1581.84 --> 1582.60]  When we help
[1582.60 --> 1583.68]  one member to flourish,
[1583.88 --> 1585.60]  all of us feel the effects.
[1585.72 --> 1587.28]  When one part of the body thrives,
[1587.50 --> 1588.26]  we all thrive.
[1588.36 --> 1589.28]  When one part suffers,
[1589.38 --> 1590.04]  we all suffer.
[1591.74 --> 1594.22]  This is Christian maturity.
[1594.80 --> 1596.04]  When we are so intertwined
[1596.58 --> 1597.70]  and connected to one another
[1597.70 --> 1599.40]  that we feel the effects
[1599.40 --> 1600.82]  when someone's not flourishing
[1600.82 --> 1601.44]  or thriving.
[1601.44 --> 1604.04]  when one part of the body
[1604.04 --> 1604.60]  is suffering
[1604.60 --> 1605.82]  or doing well.
[1606.34 --> 1607.34]  This is how we know
[1607.34 --> 1608.66]  when the whole measure
[1608.66 --> 1609.90]  of Christ's fullness
[1609.90 --> 1611.66]  is being made evident in us.
[1611.72 --> 1613.42]  When the breath of Jesus Christ
[1613.42 --> 1614.72]  fills every corner
[1614.72 --> 1616.20]  of our body.
[1616.20 --> 1620.90]  to live a life
[1620.90 --> 1622.42]  worthy of our calling.
[1623.74 --> 1625.36]  Which is Paul's main push here again.
[1625.42 --> 1626.12]  That's what we mentioned
[1626.12 --> 1626.70]  from the beginning.
[1626.80 --> 1628.22]  His main push is to live
[1628.22 --> 1630.36]  a life worthy of this calling.
[1630.48 --> 1631.34]  To do that
[1631.34 --> 1632.62]  is living
[1632.62 --> 1633.68]  into the fullness
[1633.68 --> 1634.42]  of our calling
[1634.42 --> 1635.24]  which is living
[1635.24 --> 1635.94]  into the fullness
[1635.94 --> 1636.66]  of Christ
[1636.66 --> 1638.84]  who emptied himself
[1638.84 --> 1640.12]  for the sake
[1640.12 --> 1640.88]  of the whole body.
[1640.88 --> 1644.76]  But to do this implies
[1644.76 --> 1646.12]  and this is the paradigm
[1646.12 --> 1647.22]  that Paul's setting for us
[1647.22 --> 1648.00]  here in this passage.
[1648.50 --> 1649.62]  To do this implies
[1649.62 --> 1650.24]  that one
[1650.24 --> 1651.50]  we start
[1651.50 --> 1652.74]  with Christian humility
[1652.74 --> 1653.26]  and love.
[1654.02 --> 1655.64]  We model ourselves
[1655.64 --> 1657.24]  after our servant king
[1657.24 --> 1658.56]  who humbled himself
[1658.56 --> 1659.74]  to a point of death.
[1660.48 --> 1661.56]  Even death on a cross.
[1663.26 --> 1664.66]  We start with humility
[1664.66 --> 1665.40]  and love
[1665.40 --> 1666.48]  which then in turn
[1666.48 --> 1667.12]  two
[1667.12 --> 1669.02]  fuels efforts of unity
[1669.02 --> 1671.60]  that seek to reflect
[1671.60 --> 1672.54]  the unity
[1672.54 --> 1673.70]  of God himself.
[1675.72 --> 1676.50]  And the more
[1676.50 --> 1677.16]  that we seek
[1677.16 --> 1678.60]  to be like God
[1678.60 --> 1679.76]  in his oneness
[1679.76 --> 1680.72]  and in his unity
[1680.72 --> 1681.76]  the more three
[1681.76 --> 1683.12]  will look for the gifts
[1683.12 --> 1683.70]  that the spirit
[1683.70 --> 1684.20]  has given
[1684.20 --> 1685.04]  for our community.
[1685.54 --> 1686.58]  To build it
[1686.58 --> 1687.42]  to equip it
[1687.42 --> 1688.46]  to nourish it
[1688.46 --> 1690.20]  to look for those gifts
[1690.20 --> 1690.78]  that he's given
[1690.78 --> 1691.44]  for the building
[1691.44 --> 1692.02]  of the church
[1692.02 --> 1693.58]  which then leads to four
[1693.58 --> 1695.58]  a healthier body
[1695.58 --> 1697.42]  where we are
[1697.42 --> 1698.76]  codependent
[1698.76 --> 1699.70]  on one another.
[1700.72 --> 1701.60]  Building one another
[1701.60 --> 1702.14]  up in love.
[1702.26 --> 1703.24]  We're all joined together.
[1703.40 --> 1704.00]  We're functioning
[1704.00 --> 1704.66]  as a team
[1704.66 --> 1706.38]  and we're acknowledging
[1706.38 --> 1707.56]  our need for one another.
[1709.18 --> 1710.26]  Only then five
[1710.26 --> 1711.48]  do we grow
[1711.48 --> 1713.12]  into maturity
[1713.12 --> 1715.88]  as Paul puts it
[1715.88 --> 1716.86]  and attain
[1716.86 --> 1718.34]  to the whole measure
[1718.34 --> 1719.38]  of the fullness
[1719.38 --> 1720.04]  of Christ.
[1723.88 --> 1725.24]  Is this the paradigm
[1725.24 --> 1726.84]  that we want
[1726.84 --> 1727.34]  to follow?
[1729.50 --> 1730.18]  Because oftentimes
[1730.18 --> 1730.90]  I think we tend
[1730.90 --> 1732.20]  to skip one or more
[1732.20 --> 1732.58]  of them
[1732.58 --> 1733.74]  to try to get
[1733.74 --> 1734.42]  to the end goal
[1734.42 --> 1735.40]  but we can't do that.
[1737.06 --> 1738.14]  Is this the truth
[1738.14 --> 1738.90]  that we want
[1738.90 --> 1739.42]  to proclaim?
[1740.48 --> 1742.04]  Is this the pattern
[1742.04 --> 1742.92]  that we want
[1742.92 --> 1744.10]  to pursue Christ in
[1744.10 --> 1745.06]  in every season?
[1745.18 --> 1746.44]  Is it our greatest desire
[1746.44 --> 1747.76]  to be so filled
[1747.76 --> 1748.38]  to the brim
[1748.38 --> 1748.86]  with Jesus
[1748.86 --> 1750.34]  to be so in him
[1750.34 --> 1751.36]  and he in us
[1751.36 --> 1752.50]  that we as the church
[1752.50 --> 1753.44]  are nothing less
[1753.44 --> 1754.80]  than the very reflection
[1754.80 --> 1755.56]  and fullness
[1755.56 --> 1757.24]  of Jesus Christ himself?
[1760.94 --> 1762.04]  Paul's encouragement
[1762.04 --> 1763.46]  to us in this passage
[1763.46 --> 1764.46]  is for us
[1764.46 --> 1765.86]  to know this calling.
[1767.10 --> 1768.66]  Know this calling.
[1768.92 --> 1770.40]  Know whose we are
[1770.40 --> 1772.36]  and whose body
[1772.36 --> 1773.64]  we belong to.
[1773.64 --> 1776.86]  and to know this calling
[1776.86 --> 1777.80]  so deeply
[1777.80 --> 1779.36]  that we spare
[1779.36 --> 1780.44]  no effort
[1780.44 --> 1783.32]  to pursue unity
[1783.32 --> 1784.32]  and to mature
[1784.32 --> 1785.60]  so that we can live
[1785.60 --> 1786.70]  a life worthy
[1786.70 --> 1787.50]  of this calling.
[1788.40 --> 1789.76]  We cannot take it
[1789.76 --> 1790.22]  for granted.
[1791.52 --> 1793.12]  To breathe together
[1793.12 --> 1794.14]  in the Holy Spirit
[1794.14 --> 1795.84]  as one body
[1795.84 --> 1796.52]  of Jesus
[1796.52 --> 1797.36]  who is our head
[1797.36 --> 1798.74]  so that the fullness
[1798.74 --> 1799.38]  of Jesus
[1799.38 --> 1800.86]  can be in us
[1800.86 --> 1801.94]  and we in him.
[1801.94 --> 1805.56]  this is Paul's prayer
[1805.56 --> 1807.16]  for the church.
[1807.96 --> 1808.92]  This was his prayer
[1808.92 --> 1810.12]  for the Ephesians.
[1810.96 --> 1812.28]  It was Jesus' prayer
[1812.28 --> 1813.52]  in John 17
[1813.52 --> 1814.42]  for his disciples.
[1817.02 --> 1818.26]  May it be our prayer
[1818.26 --> 1818.78]  as well.
[1822.48 --> 1823.52]  Would you pray with me?
[1829.20 --> 1829.86]  Living God,
[1829.86 --> 1831.76]  we are humbled
[1831.76 --> 1832.42]  by your word.
[1834.24 --> 1834.88]  We're humbled
[1834.88 --> 1835.98]  by the depth
[1835.98 --> 1836.76]  of what Paul
[1836.76 --> 1837.66]  has written for us,
[1837.76 --> 1837.84]  Lord,
[1837.92 --> 1838.48]  what he originally
[1838.48 --> 1840.18]  wrote for the Ephesians,
[1840.34 --> 1840.42]  Lord,
[1840.48 --> 1841.34]  but that we know
[1841.34 --> 1842.30]  he wrote for us as well.
[1843.00 --> 1843.80]  We pray that
[1843.80 --> 1844.74]  your words alone,
[1844.86 --> 1844.98]  Lord,
[1845.08 --> 1846.66]  would seep into our hearts
[1846.66 --> 1847.50]  and into our minds.
[1847.88 --> 1848.90]  That we may know you
[1848.90 --> 1849.44]  more deeply
[1849.44 --> 1850.86]  and love you
[1850.86 --> 1851.48]  more thoroughly.
[1852.36 --> 1852.88]  Grant us
[1852.88 --> 1854.06]  a new, Lord,
[1854.12 --> 1855.10]  the gift of your Holy Spirit
[1855.10 --> 1855.64]  within us.
[1855.96 --> 1857.10]  That we may breathe
[1857.10 --> 1858.10]  with your breath.
[1858.10 --> 1859.90]  that we may sit
[1859.90 --> 1861.38]  under the authority
[1861.38 --> 1862.36]  of your head,
[1862.74 --> 1863.58]  of you as our head.
[1864.86 --> 1865.90]  That we may function
[1865.90 --> 1866.52]  together
[1866.52 --> 1867.64]  in a unified way
[1867.64 --> 1868.30]  as one body.
[1869.34 --> 1869.98]  Bind us together,
[1870.10 --> 1870.22]  Lord,
[1870.28 --> 1870.60]  we pray.
[1871.32 --> 1872.38]  In your powerful name,
[1872.46 --> 1872.66]  Jesus.
[1873.38 --> 1873.60]  Amen.
[1873.62 --> 1873.88]  Amen.
[1874.50 --> 1874.92]  Amen.
[1883.26 --> 1883.90]  Amen.

[1886.78 --> 1887.48]  Amen.
[1887.48 --> 1887.66]  Amen.
[1887.66 --> 1887.82]  Amen.
[1887.86 --> 1888.02]  Amen.
[1888.14 --> 1888.60]  Amen.
[1888.60 --> 1888.82]  Amen.
[1888.98 --> 1889.12]  Amen.
[1889.26 --> 1889.76]  Amen.
[1889.76 --> 1890.02]  Amen.
[1890.54 --> 1893.64]  Amen.
[1894.28 --> 1895.82]  Amen.
[1896.16 --> 1896.30]  Amen.
[1896.30 --> 1896.50]  Amen.
[1896.56 --> 1898.60]  Amen.
[1898.60 --> 1898.82]  Amen.
[1901.70 --> 1902.40]  Amen.
[1902.40 --> 1903.52]  Amen.
