• The world is enslaved, and human beings are enslaved, specifically to spiritual forces of evil and the power of sin.
• Slavery is not just a physical condition, but also an ontological one that affects people's lives in various ways.
• Examples of slavery include being enslaved to work, sex, gaming, media, social media, perfectionism, material prosperity, and idol-making (elevating creation above God).
• Western culture often disguises or trivializes these forms of slavery, presenting them as normal or desirable behaviors.
• People are vulnerable to enslavement and easily seduced from God's good design for their lives into destruction and chaos.

• God's love and commitment to redemption are demonstrated through Jesus on the cross, where He receives the wrath for humanity's sin and offers forgiveness and restoration
• The gospel is described as being set free from slavery, being released from bondage, and being saved through faith in Jesus
