[0.00 → 1.00] Amen.
[30.00 → 34.00] We have a lot of money and awareness for the Coverdale Kitchen.
[34.00 → 36.00] And we just want to thank you for generously supporting us.
[36.00 → 39.00] I heard this morning that we raised over 18,000, which is incredible.
[39.00 → 43.00] The top fundraising team in Coverdale, not that we're competing.
[43.00 → 45.00] But we really do appreciate the support.
[45.00 → 49.00] And obviously, if you know the Coverdale Community Kitchen and our partnership with them,
[49.00 → 50.00] they're an amazing organization.
[50.00 → 54.00] We're so grateful that we can do good work with them for Coverdale.
[54.00 → 58.00] Secondly, you will have received this by email yesterday.
[58.00 → 62.00] But we want to use our space in this building creatively in the next few months.
[62.00 → 66.00] This is one of those rare times when there's actually not that many things happening in person.
[66.00 → 70.00] And so if you come across a rainy day, and you're a bit stir-crazy with your family in the home,
[70.00 → 73.00] you can just call Estelle and you can book the church.
[73.00 → 79.00] There's space for pickleball or foosball or badminton or volleyball if you're a huge family like the Van Tolls.
[79.00 → 80.00] Or there's stuff you can do upstairs.
[80.00 → 87.00] But you're welcome to call and just book a time and use this gym space in a way that's going to be fruitful for your family.
[87.00 → 91.00] Thirdly, we're going to be sending out a survey this week.
[91.00 → 97.00] And the survey is basically a way of checking in with you as families and hearing how things are going with worship and life.
[97.00 → 105.00] But it's also an invitation for your creative ideas, your thoughts, your reflections on how we can be church and do ministry well in the city in this season.
[105.00 → 109.00] We do pray that this is sort of a home stretch for us with COVID.
[109.00 → 114.00] And we want to invite all creative ideas on how to do ministry well in these next few months ahead.
[114.00 → 120.00] And if you've been around Hope long enough, you'll know that we'll entertain pretty crazy ideas that we think it's going to be for the ministry of Christ in the city.
[120.00 → 121.00] And it's going to bless people.
[121.00 → 125.00] So we welcome those as you get your surveys back to us.
[125.00 → 130.00] Finally, on behalf of Misha, you should know that youth resumes in person this week.
[130.00 → 134.00] The rest of us ministry leaders are jealous because youth gets to meet in person.
[134.00 → 135.00] No hard feelings, Misha.
[135.00 → 138.00] But on Monday, it starts at 6.30 for junior youth.
[138.00 → 140.00] And on Tuesday, it starts at 7 for senior youth.
[140.00 → 143.00] And if you have any questions, you are welcome to email Misha.
[143.00 → 150.00] And if you haven't heard from her and get any emails from her, you also contact her, and she'll put you on the list.
[150.00 → 162.00] As we enter into worship in this Lent season, I just invite you to pause and to breathe and to become aware of the fact that God dwells among us.
[162.00 → 168.00] That Christ by his spirit is in your homes, working in your hearts, in your families.
[168.00 → 175.00] Even now, as we draw together as the body of Christ scattered around this city.
[175.00 → 179.00] I want to read an invitation to worship that comes from the book of Ephesians.
[179.00 → 184.00] And this is a prayer for the church and a prayer for us as we begin our service together.
[184.00 → 191.00] For this reason, I kneel before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.
[191.00 → 198.00] I pray that out of his glorious riches, he may strengthen you with power through his spirit and your inner being.
[198.00 → 201.00] So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[201.00 → 211.00] And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power together with all the Lord's people, right now scattered around the city.
[211.00 → 216.00] To grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ.
[216.00 → 220.00] And to know that this love surpasses knowledge.
[220.00 → 225.00] That you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
[225.00 → 227.00] Would you join with me in opening prayer?
[227.00 → 233.00] Father, we want to be filled with the measure of all the fullness of God.
[233.00 → 238.00] We want to experience the power of Jesus in community.
[238.00 → 243.00] And even now, as we're scattered around the city, we do ask that you would move in our homes.
[243.00 → 244.00] That you would move in our families.
[244.00 → 247.00] And you would move through this time of worship together.
[247.00 → 250.00] We ask that you would pour out your spirit on us.
[250.00 → 254.00] And that as our worship rises to you, that you would be pleased with what we offer.
[254.00 → 259.00] And that you would grow us as disciples who bless this city in the name of Jesus.
[259.00 → 263.00] To that end, we ask that you would be pleased, and you would be honoured by this worship service.
[263.00 → 265.00] We pray in Christ's name.
[265.00 → 266.00] Amen.
[266.00 → 273.00] At this time, I invite you to pull out your phones and to greet and pass the peace of Christ to your brothers and sisters in this community.
[273.00 → 279.00] Thank you for that, and I want to thank you all at the church and sisters in this community.
[279.00 → 308.98] Thank you.
[309.00 → 338.98] Thank you.
[339.60 → 341.30] Good morning, Hope Community Church.
[341.52 → 343.00] Where you are at home right now,
[343.56 → 345.30] we invite you to stand
[345.30 → 347.44] and to do more than just stand.
[347.52 → 349.30] I want you to think about the words as you see them
[349.30 → 350.24] on the screen this morning.
[350.82 → 353.60] And as you worship, I want you to let the words
[353.60 → 355.44] impact you and allow
[355.44 → 357.70] Christ to become the focus of your thoughts
[357.70 → 359.46] and all that's going on
[359.46 → 361.14] in your life right now that would settle down
[361.14 → 363.28] and you can focus on Jesus as we
[363.28 → 365.56] prepare our hearts to receive from the word this morning.
[365.94 → 366.98] Let's worship together.
[366.98 → 368.98] Let's worship together.
[368.98 → 370.98] Let's worship together.
[370.98 → 372.98] Let's worship together.
[372.98 → 390.32] Nothing can separate
[390.32 → 396.32] your love never fails.
[396.32 → 406.52] I know I still make mistakes, but
[406.52 → 409.96] you have new mercies for me every day.
[409.96 → 411.96] Your love never fails.
[411.96 → 413.96] Your love never fails.
[413.96 → 421.96] You stay the same through the ages.
[421.96 → 426.96] Your love never changes.
[426.96 → 433.96] There may be pain in the night, but joy comes in the morning.
[433.96 → 442.96] And when the oceans rage, I don't have to be afraid.
[442.96 → 446.96] Because I know that you love me.
[446.96 → 449.96] Your love never fails.
[449.96 → 450.96] Your love never fails.
[450.96 → 451.96] Your love never fails.
[451.96 → 453.96] Your love never fails.
[453.96 → 454.96] Your love never fails.
[454.96 → 456.96] The wind is strong and the water's deep.
[456.96 → 461.96] But I'm not alone here in these open seas.
[461.96 → 462.96] Your love never fails.
[462.96 → 463.96] Your love never fails.
[463.96 → 464.96] Your love never fails.
[464.96 → 469.96] Your love never fails.
[469.96 → 470.96] Somebody fails.
[470.96 → 471.70] depending on on to help me.
[471.70 → 472.96] The applause of your love never fails.
[472.96 → 473.96] He'll transform you after your love by looking.
[473.96 → 476.96] And only one and wondering if you feel we use it lion.
[476.96 → 477.96] You keep in touch, Mr. Young's a fixing in awe.
[477.96 → 478.96] Love never fails.
[478.96 → 479.96] The pain, Mr. Young's a sugar.
[479.96 → 480.96] Your life never fails.
[480.96 → 486.48] Or you keep is Rug
[486.48 → 501.56] You stay the same through the ages. Your love never changes. There may be pain in the night, but joy comes in the morning.
[501.56 → 521.56] And when the oceans rage, I don't have to be afraid. Because I know that you love me. Your love never fails.
[521.56 → 535.32] You make all things work together for my good.
[535.32 → 561.32] You make all things work together for my good.
[561.32 → 577.32] You stay the same through the ages. Your love never changes. There may be pain in the night, but joy comes in the morning.
[577.32 → 595.32] And when the oceans rage, I don't have to be afraid. Because I know that you love me. Your love never fails.
[595.32 → 613.32] Your love never fails. Your love never fails.
[613.32 → 638.32] Your love never fails.
[638.32 → 648.32] Come out of sadness from wherever you've been. Come brokenhearted, let a rescue begin.
[648.32 → 658.32] Come find your mercy. O sinner, come kneel. Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal.
[658.32 → 676.32] Lay down your burden. Lay down your shame.
[676.32 → 678.32] All who are broken.
[678.32 → 696.32] All who are broken. Lift your face. O wanderer, come home. You're not too far.
[696.32 → 708.32] Lay down your hurt. Lay down your heart. Lay down your heart. Come as you are.
[708.32 → 710.32] There's hope for the hopeless.
[710.32 → 718.32] There's hope for the hopeless. And all those who've strayed. Come sit at the table. Come taste the grace.
[718.32 → 720.32] Rest for the hopeless.
[720.32 → 722.32] Rest for the weary. Rest for the weary. Rest that endures.
[722.32 → 728.32] Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal.
[728.32 → 730.32] Rest for the weary.
[730.32 → 738.32] Lay down your hurt. Lay down your pain. Lay down your pain.
[738.32 → 756.32] All who are broken. Lift your face. O wanderer, come home. You're not too far.
[756.32 → 774.32] Come as you are. Lay down your hurt. Lay down your heart. Come as you are. Come as you are.
[774.32 → 784.32] Hold it his arms. Come as you are. There's joy for the hopeless.
[784.32 → 794.32] There's joy for the mourning. O sinner, be still. Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal.
[794.32 → 802.32] Earth has no sorrow that heaven can't heal.
[802.32 → 830.32] So lay down your hurt. Lay down your shame. All who are broken. Lift your face. O wanderer, come home. You're not too far.
[830.32 → 832.32] Lay down your pain. Lay down your hurt. Petering down your hurt. Come as you are.
[832.32 → 852.32] Lay down your heart. Lay down your hurt. Come as you are. Come as you are. Come as you are. Come as you are.
[852.32 → 856.00] as you are.
[864.34 → 865.52] Good morning, everybody.
[866.38 → 869.22] I'm Randy Klarczyk, and I come humbly before you this morning
[869.22 → 871.32] to give the community prayer.
[872.46 → 874.26] Welcome to our broadcast this morning.
[875.24 → 878.16] Just thinking about all the terms that we talk about getting together now
[878.16 → 881.98] instead of being in person, like virtual, streaming,
[882.94 → 886.94] online, zooming in, Microsoft meetings,
[887.94 → 890.68] and I'm sure there's a whole host of others that I don't really know about
[890.68 → 891.66] or haven't heard.
[892.56 → 895.58] But nothing beats getting together in person,
[896.46 → 899.40] and that would lead us to Hope Community Church here on Fraser Highway.
[900.04 → 903.20] We're not quite yet getting to meet here yet,
[904.00 → 907.80] but things are looking better, and I'm hopeful it'll come soon.
[908.90 → 911.92] Thanks, music team, for those couple of songs.
[912.32 → 916.66] I must admit I had a real chuckle this morning when I was reading what the songs were,
[916.74 → 918.96] and I thought, wow, we're a really progressive church.
[919.44 → 922.50] We're playing Nirvana songs for our worship.
[923.52 → 926.10] It's good to see the words aren't quite the same as Kurt Cobain,
[926.94 → 929.68] but, you know, he did sing a few songs about Jesus,
[930.06 → 933.36] so he did copy a few hymns in his time.
[933.36 → 939.04] So now, if you would like to bow your heads at home and join me in praying,
[939.84 → 941.20] I'll do my best.
[943.60 → 946.74] Dear Lord, thanks for bringing us together in this way.
[948.06 → 951.66] Your word and the will of your people will always bring us together.
[951.66 → 954.06] Father, we are a resilient people,
[954.38 → 958.08] and I pray we will gather forever, forever,
[958.56 → 959.86] despite these difficulties.
[960.98 → 964.14] We should be reminded of many of the churches in the world
[964.14 → 967.58] that aren't even allowed to meet, even if there was no COVID.
[968.76 → 972.28] So we praise you that we have been able to go online for our church,
[972.28 → 978.92] and that others who have never been able to meet in church, in person,
[979.78 → 984.02] have many other choices now to hear your word around the world
[984.02 → 987.14] in so many different ways or so many different languages.
[988.08 → 993.46] You have brought light into a dark time here by allowing us to go online,
[994.12 → 996.26] and so we thank all the techies in the world
[996.26 → 1001.30] to help ministers and preachers and pastors to bring the word of Jesus
[1001.30 → 1003.02] in another way.
[1004.36 → 1007.60] We thank you also for the Bible that's in the same way
[1007.60 → 1010.06] that is out there throughout the world.
[1011.08 → 1015.56] The teachings in Colossians of compassion, kindness, humility,
[1016.68 → 1018.94] gentleness, and patience, and love,
[1019.88 → 1024.06] give us hope to pass on these virtues to our community
[1024.06 → 1026.84] and hence make the world a better place.
[1027.94 → 1030.84] Open our hearts to these virtues and absorb them.
[1031.78 → 1035.96] Help us to learn and lead by example to others.
[1036.66 → 1039.28] Let others see that we are different on how we act.
[1040.76 → 1043.12] The fundraiser of the coldest night of the year
[1043.12 → 1045.64] is a great way to keep involved in our community
[1045.64 → 1048.08] and to give you glory, God.
[1048.08 → 1050.92] God, we thank you for all who participated,
[1051.72 → 1052.96] for all the organizers,
[1053.52 → 1055.92] and for the money raised for the homeless.
[1056.06 → 1056.56] We thank you.
[1056.66 → 1057.02] Thank you.
[1058.46 → 1061.68] We thank you for the message from Jonathan this morning,
[1061.68 → 1063.70] and I pray that we can learn from it
[1063.70 → 1065.96] to show others what a Christian is
[1065.96 → 1069.78] and how these teachings create a better world for all.
[1070.62 → 1074.80] Your enduring passion to have us have free will
[1074.80 → 1077.36] and to follow you is hard
[1077.36 → 1079.42] and has plagued us throughout the history of the world.
[1079.42 → 1084.74] I pray that we can be a forever follower with these virtues.
[1085.58 → 1088.78] How can we not when we know that you love us so much
[1088.78 → 1092.84] and you give us everything, everlasting life?
[1092.84 → 1095.66] We are sinful, and we are thankful.
[1096.38 → 1097.32] You cleanse our sins.
[1097.50 → 1098.38] You wash them away.
[1098.52 → 1099.72] You give us eternal life,
[1100.18 → 1102.50] all for having faith in you.
[1103.56 → 1104.72] Life is precious, Lord,
[1104.82 → 1106.54] and we pray that our sins are forgiven
[1106.54 → 1108.42] and that we can move forward
[1108.42 → 1111.96] and do our best to follow Jesus Christ.
[1113.00 → 1114.98] Knowing that you overlook our imperfections
[1114.98 → 1116.48] and give us eternal life is a blessing
[1116.48 → 1118.42] that I don't think we fully comprehend.
[1120.20 → 1121.62] Please, God, give us mercy.
[1122.84 → 1125.08] Thank you for power, your glory,
[1125.08 → 1126.52] and your eternal love.
[1127.34 → 1128.50] God is great.
[1129.38 → 1129.68] Amen.
[1149.06 → 1150.02] Good morning.
[1150.02 → 1153.88] Hey, I get a good morning back.
[1154.22 → 1154.68] Nice.
[1155.42 → 1158.70] I'm sure you guys at home are saying good morning back to me.
[1159.12 → 1160.26] So, thank you.
[1160.58 → 1162.94] And so, good morning to everyone at home.
[1163.28 → 1164.52] Good morning to everyone here.
[1165.68 → 1167.98] I'm excited to be blessed by God's Word today.
[1168.34 → 1170.76] So, please turn with me to Colossians 3.
[1171.16 → 1174.08] Have it open as we will be reading it very soon.
[1175.08 → 1175.86] Before we do,
[1175.86 → 1179.82] we continue in our series of apprenticing with Jesus.
[1180.10 → 1183.04] And I think this is a beautiful picture and artwork
[1183.04 → 1188.26] that expresses our desire to be like Christ.
[1188.90 → 1191.00] And we have a deep desire for this.
[1191.94 → 1195.58] Last week, Dave guided us through the passage in 1 Corinthians,
[1195.98 → 1197.54] passages in 1 Corinthians,
[1197.92 → 1202.38] and how we are called as a people of God in community,
[1202.38 → 1205.84] which is definitely against the individualistic culture
[1205.84 → 1207.58] that we face in our context today.
[1209.00 → 1210.00] And so, this morning,
[1210.12 → 1212.52] I want to look deeper into our calling,
[1213.06 → 1215.26] our identity as a community,
[1215.76 → 1217.00] as God's chosen people,
[1217.28 → 1217.98] not persons,
[1218.42 → 1219.42] and there is a difference,
[1220.20 → 1220.54] means,
[1220.62 → 1221.24] what this means,
[1221.30 → 1222.96] and how that affects our lives
[1222.96 → 1225.28] as this community of Christ followers.
[1225.28 → 1229.08] And so, let us dive into our text today.
[1229.84 → 1232.62] Colossians 3, verses 12 to 17.
[1233.74 → 1235.08] Hear the word of the Lord.
[1236.36 → 1239.22] Therefore, as God's chosen people,
[1239.86 → 1241.44] holy and dearly loved,
[1242.28 → 1243.82] clothe yourselves with compassion,
[1244.10 → 1246.90] kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
[1248.08 → 1250.48] Bear with each other and forgive one another
[1250.48 → 1254.12] if any of you has a grievance against someone.
[1254.12 → 1257.00] Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[1258.08 → 1259.32] And over all these virtues,
[1259.50 → 1260.36] put on love,
[1260.70 → 1264.06] which binds them all together in perfect unity.
[1265.22 → 1267.44] Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts,
[1267.56 → 1269.26] since as members of one body,
[1269.70 → 1270.82] you were called to peace.
[1271.02 → 1271.72] And be thankful.
[1272.66 → 1275.32] Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly
[1275.32 → 1277.04] as you teach and admonish one another
[1277.04 → 1278.90] with all wisdom through psalms,
[1279.04 → 1280.44] hymns, and songs from the Spirit,
[1280.92 → 1283.30] singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.
[1283.30 → 1285.50] And whatever you do,
[1285.88 → 1287.46] whether in word or deed,
[1287.82 → 1290.12] do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1290.52 → 1293.08] giving thanks to God the Father through him.
[1294.06 → 1294.36] Amen.
[1297.96 → 1301.34] Being a community of believers is our identity,
[1301.64 → 1303.34] and I'm going to emphasize this a lot today.
[1303.34 → 1307.38] We recognize ourselves as a people of God,
[1307.48 → 1307.74] and again,
[1307.82 → 1310.64] not just individual believers who gather maybe once a week,
[1310.86 → 1311.32] for some,
[1311.40 → 1312.16] maybe once a month,
[1312.34 → 1313.40] once a year,
[1313.48 → 1314.08] hopefully not.
[1314.90 → 1317.30] But to emphasize this point of identity,
[1317.72 → 1319.98] I thought about when I became a Canadian citizen,
[1320.30 → 1321.80] and this was in 2013,
[1321.80 → 1323.44] when I became a Canadian citizen.
[1323.88 → 1325.98] And I was given this new identity.
[1325.98 → 1328.62] Just a side note,
[1328.78 → 1329.46] if you're a Korean,
[1329.62 → 1332.96] and you get a new citizenship from any other country,
[1333.06 → 1334.62] you have to give up your Korean one.
[1334.90 → 1337.12] So this image works in this aspect.
[1337.52 → 1340.24] You have to let go of your Korean citizenship,
[1340.46 → 1341.28] your Korean identity.
[1342.40 → 1344.80] And so when you think of the identity of a Canadian,
[1345.28 → 1346.10] what do you think of?
[1346.10 → 1350.38] People who speak English or French as their first language.
[1351.08 → 1352.62] People who love routine.
[1354.14 → 1356.20] People who hold a door for someone,
[1356.36 → 1357.96] even if they're like 10 meters away.
[1358.22 → 1358.78] I got it.
[1358.96 → 1359.56] I got it.
[1359.84 → 1360.02] Right?
[1360.64 → 1362.54] And people who always say sorry.
[1364.14 → 1366.24] I don't know if that's the Canadian-ness in me,
[1366.34 → 1367.34] but I say sorry a lot.
[1367.50 → 1368.00] I've noticed.
[1370.46 → 1371.16] It's okay.
[1373.46 → 1375.40] But you can't really expect someone
[1375.40 → 1377.94] who has just become a Canadian citizen,
[1378.10 → 1378.84] like in my case,
[1379.00 → 1381.50] to live out their new identity instantly.
[1383.86 → 1385.20] I share this imagery
[1385.20 → 1386.86] knowing that there are limitations
[1386.86 → 1389.70] when it comes to comparing with our Christian identity.
[1390.46 → 1392.30] For being a true Canadian citizen,
[1392.84 → 1394.00] these things that I listed,
[1394.18 → 1395.58] just some of the stereotypical things,
[1395.88 → 1397.56] are not a perfect reflection
[1397.56 → 1400.02] of what it means to be a true Canadian.
[1401.10 → 1402.88] I can still love my kimchi,
[1403.36 → 1404.22] my Korean dramas,
[1404.22 → 1405.88] and my Korean music,
[1406.52 → 1408.88] and still call myself a true Canadian citizen.
[1410.42 → 1413.14] But in the case of our identity in Christ,
[1414.14 → 1415.04] being compassionate,
[1415.82 → 1416.26] kind,
[1416.52 → 1416.80] humble,
[1417.04 → 1417.38] gentle,
[1417.62 → 1417.94] patient,
[1418.36 → 1418.94] and forgiving,
[1419.80 → 1420.52] and loving,
[1421.68 → 1424.16] that we witness in our text today,
[1424.46 → 1426.38] this is a perfect reflection
[1426.38 → 1427.98] of our new identity in Christ.
[1427.98 → 1431.44] And so the main message this morning is this.
[1432.58 → 1435.34] It is a command to live out our identity
[1435.34 → 1436.88] as a people of God,
[1437.04 → 1438.26] called as a community,
[1438.38 → 1439.42] a corporate body,
[1439.96 → 1440.80] not individuals.
[1441.48 → 1442.56] Can't stress that enough.
[1443.26 → 1445.74] And this identity is not just instantaneous.
[1446.42 → 1448.54] It is a lifelong process,
[1449.02 → 1449.98] and it requires,
[1450.54 → 1451.54] and it does require,
[1451.68 → 1452.68] and it does reflect,
[1452.68 → 1455.48] perfect unity within this community.
[1457.34 → 1458.80] The good news, though,
[1459.46 → 1460.62] the gospel message,
[1461.04 → 1463.34] is that we can be thankful
[1463.34 → 1465.20] that this perfection
[1465.20 → 1467.34] that is required of our identities
[1467.34 → 1469.28] is attained by Christ,
[1469.46 → 1470.28] not use.
[1470.28 → 1474.64] And so let us review this identity of ours.
[1475.84 → 1477.12] Paul says in his letter
[1477.12 → 1479.00] to the believers of Colossae,
[1479.48 → 1480.44] to the Colossian church,
[1480.80 → 1482.66] that they are God's chosen people.
[1482.84 → 1483.66] So we're in verse 12.
[1484.44 → 1486.74] They are called God's chosen people,
[1487.04 → 1487.60] the elect,
[1488.26 → 1489.70] holy and dearly loved.
[1490.48 → 1492.26] If you go up a couple of verses,
[1492.74 → 1493.84] in verses 9 to 10,
[1493.98 → 1495.10] which I have on the screen,
[1495.78 → 1496.14] screen,
[1497.70 → 1499.00] Paul is a little more specific.
[1499.00 → 1500.40] In verse 9 to 10,
[1500.48 → 1500.88] he says,
[1501.14 → 1502.22] and he calls us a people
[1502.22 → 1504.54] who have put off our old selves
[1504.54 → 1506.60] and have put on our new selves.
[1506.74 → 1507.34] I'm paraphrasing.
[1508.22 → 1509.08] It is past tense,
[1509.30 → 1510.22] already done.
[1510.76 → 1511.96] The paperwork is filed,
[1512.08 → 1512.80] and it's certified,
[1513.24 → 1514.08] and you're already,
[1514.22 → 1517.08] we are already a people of this kingdom.
[1517.52 → 1518.22] We are citizens.
[1519.32 → 1519.76] And thus,
[1519.96 → 1521.90] as a perfect reflection of our identity,
[1522.22 → 1524.38] we are called to bear one another in love.
[1526.28 → 1527.40] This is reflected,
[1527.40 → 1529.50] this love is reflected by putting on,
[1529.62 → 1530.86] literally putting on,
[1530.96 → 1531.70] clothing ourselves
[1531.70 → 1532.84] with compassion,
[1533.26 → 1533.56] kindness,
[1533.76 → 1534.12] humility,
[1534.54 → 1534.90] gentleness,
[1535.06 → 1535.68] and patience.
[1536.26 → 1538.40] Along with these Christ-like traits,
[1539.78 → 1541.90] Paul continues to encourage believers
[1541.90 → 1542.92] to bear one another
[1542.92 → 1544.50] and forgive one another
[1544.50 → 1547.96] if there is a grudge among those
[1547.96 → 1549.88] being in the community.
[1549.88 → 1551.72] If,
[1551.94 → 1553.56] if there is a grudge,
[1553.86 → 1554.14] really,
[1554.28 → 1554.48] Paul,
[1555.08 → 1555.88] it's hypothetical,
[1556.42 → 1557.20] but it's true.
[1559.78 → 1561.86] Remember that we are a beautiful mess.
[1562.18 → 1563.02] I like that imagery.
[1563.76 → 1563.94] It's,
[1564.18 → 1566.52] it is a really accurate description
[1566.52 → 1567.52] of the church.
[1568.30 → 1570.74] We are beautiful in that we identify with God,
[1571.24 → 1572.26] holy and beloved,
[1572.88 → 1574.60] but we are messy
[1574.60 → 1576.04] in that we are still sinners.
[1576.04 → 1578.18] As sinners,
[1578.44 → 1579.26] there are always,
[1579.60 → 1580.94] and there will always be,
[1581.48 → 1583.52] cases where we need to forgive one another
[1583.52 → 1585.16] and bear one another in love.
[1586.52 → 1587.42] As such,
[1587.64 → 1588.66] Paul goes on to say,
[1589.10 → 1589.92] in verse 14,
[1590.30 → 1592.44] that in order to achieve this perfect unity,
[1593.32 → 1594.58] among all these virtues,
[1595.10 → 1596.26] love must be put on.
[1596.52 → 1598.18] Love is the most important aspect.
[1599.52 → 1601.64] It is obvious that Paul is emphasizing love,
[1601.70 → 1603.74] which binds everything in this perfect unity.
[1603.74 → 1606.80] He is reflecting God's commands for his people,
[1607.26 → 1608.04] which requires,
[1608.80 → 1609.46] love God,
[1610.16 → 1610.86] love neighbour.
[1612.76 → 1614.10] One expert in the law
[1614.10 → 1616.26] challenges Jesus with these words,
[1616.48 → 1617.14] with this question.
[1618.42 → 1618.86] Teacher,
[1619.02 → 1620.20] what is the greatest commandment?
[1623.08 → 1624.06] Jesus answers,
[1624.40 → 1625.58] love the Lord your God
[1625.58 → 1626.62] with all your heart,
[1626.70 → 1627.36] with all your mind,
[1627.44 → 1628.02] with all your soul,
[1628.10 → 1628.92] with all your strength.
[1629.76 → 1630.74] And secondly,
[1631.28 → 1632.88] love your neighbour as yourself.
[1633.74 → 1635.98] This latter part of this golden rule
[1635.98 → 1639.42] is actually quoted from Leviticus 19,
[1639.82 → 1642.24] where I just preached a sermon for my class last week.
[1642.76 → 1645.22] And so let me give you like a one-minute summary of my sermon.
[1645.36 → 1646.34] I won't do the whole thing,
[1646.42 → 1647.20] because it was too long.
[1647.68 → 1651.38] But it relates exactly with what Paul is trying to say this morning.
[1652.26 → 1653.00] The chapter,
[1653.38 → 1654.54] which is Leviticus 19,
[1654.88 → 1658.38] is about this perfect unity that Paul encourages for the church.
[1658.38 → 1661.32] It is about not wronging fellow neighbours,
[1661.72 → 1662.84] so fellow Israelites,
[1663.48 → 1664.38] and loving one another.
[1665.88 → 1669.72] God commands Moses to address the entire assembly of Israel.
[1670.00 → 1671.58] This is in verse 1 of chapter 19.
[1671.94 → 1672.80] Not just priests,
[1674.08 → 1675.00] not just leaders,
[1675.76 → 1677.68] but to the whole people of God,
[1677.92 → 1680.48] the whole community of God.
[1680.48 → 1683.22] And he commands Moses to say to them,
[1683.72 → 1684.96] You shall be holy.
[1685.36 → 1686.70] You, all of you,
[1686.94 → 1687.74] shall be holy,
[1688.00 → 1688.86] because I,
[1689.18 → 1690.12] the Lord your God,
[1690.18 → 1690.66] am holy.
[1691.42 → 1693.04] This is Leviticus 19, 2.
[1694.02 → 1695.12] The people of God
[1695.12 → 1697.28] are commanded to bear one another in love,
[1697.52 → 1699.92] because they identify with this holy God,
[1700.08 → 1701.64] who saved them from Egypt,
[1702.00 → 1704.32] who loved them first.
[1704.32 → 1711.18] And so Paul paints that same picture of perfect unity for us in Colossians.
[1711.70 → 1714.46] What we as the new people of God should look like.
[1715.78 → 1718.84] A community called and identified as a kingdom people.
[1719.78 → 1722.10] Not a group of individual kingdom persons,
[1722.42 → 1725.70] but a corporate body perfectly loving each other in unity.
[1727.48 → 1730.06] A commentator for Colossians sums it up very well.
[1730.48 → 1731.82] What Paul is trying to do here.
[1732.82 → 1734.14] And I have the quote up.
[1735.30 → 1735.98] For reference,
[1736.66 → 1740.80] Paul's thought is never narrowly individual and pietistic,
[1741.38 → 1743.98] as though his chief design was to write a manual
[1743.98 → 1745.84] for the interior life of sainthood.
[1747.06 → 1750.50] His concern is ever with the Christian's corporate life.
[1751.38 → 1754.12] And the perfection he sets before his readers
[1754.12 → 1756.68] is attained only in the fellowship of believers
[1756.68 → 1758.90] whose attitudes and living together
[1758.90 → 1761.48] reflect something of the graces of verse 12
[1761.48 → 1763.32] and the spirit of verse 13,
[1763.32 → 1766.02] of the Colossians 3 text that we looked at.
[1767.92 → 1771.12] But let me suggest that we must go deeper than this.
[1772.64 → 1776.20] Here is where the gospel defines this identity of ours.
[1776.20 → 1781.42] The gospel truth is that we can't attain this perfection.
[1784.54 → 1788.84] We can't create or embody this perfect body of Christ,
[1789.22 → 1791.28] this community bearing one another in love,
[1791.40 → 1792.60] producing perfect unity.
[1792.60 → 1794.98] We cannot achieve this,
[1794.98 → 1795.90] attain this,
[1796.08 → 1796.88] embody this.
[1797.44 → 1800.08] Only God can embody this,
[1800.30 → 1802.06] and that is good news for all of us.
[1802.06 → 1805.30] I don't know about you,
[1805.62 → 1806.70] but if it was up to me,
[1806.96 → 1808.06] and thankfully it's not,
[1808.32 → 1810.08] or even the leadership here at Hope,
[1810.42 → 1812.54] to create this perfect community of faith,
[1813.12 → 1814.14] we'd be in a lot of trouble.
[1814.86 → 1816.04] No offence to leaders here,
[1816.16 → 1817.64] who are doing a wonderful job.
[1818.16 → 1819.28] Even then,
[1819.66 → 1822.52] even if you have great people like we have here at Hope,
[1822.70 → 1824.58] we cannot attain this perfect unity
[1824.58 → 1826.58] that is demanded of our identity.
[1826.58 → 1830.12] In verse 13,
[1830.80 → 1833.80] Paul's encouragement to forgive as the Lord forgave
[1833.80 → 1836.08] is the obvious reminder of this point.
[1837.82 → 1839.80] Why would Paul need to encourage God's people
[1839.80 → 1840.86] to forgive one another
[1840.86 → 1843.42] if everyone can just love one another perfectly?
[1843.70 → 1845.62] If we are living out this identity
[1845.62 → 1848.20] of as kingdom people,
[1848.38 → 1849.40] as a corporate body,
[1849.52 → 1851.98] who worship the one and only living God,
[1852.44 → 1854.22] why does Paul need to remind us that,
[1854.22 → 1855.22] hey, remember,
[1855.22 → 1859.04] if there are any grievances among you,
[1859.36 → 1861.00] you must forgive one another.
[1861.38 → 1861.62] Why?
[1861.76 → 1863.84] Because God has forgiven you as well.
[1868.18 → 1870.28] That is why in verse 15,
[1870.64 → 1873.04] Paul transitions to emphasize
[1873.04 → 1874.74] the peace of Christ.
[1876.24 → 1877.90] The peace of Christ,
[1878.32 → 1880.24] as a mediator for our sins,
[1880.70 → 1882.32] attains that perfect unity.
[1882.32 → 1886.36] Again, Paul is not trying to create a manual
[1886.36 → 1887.70] for individual believers
[1887.70 → 1889.24] on how to become more holy.
[1890.34 → 1892.44] This perfect picture painted by Paul
[1892.44 → 1894.40] is a reflection of our whole lives
[1894.40 → 1895.32] as living sacrifices,
[1895.98 → 1897.90] as we looked at in Romans 12.
[1898.38 → 1900.26] Living as a worshipping community,
[1900.64 → 1901.82] and not just on Sunday,
[1902.90 → 1904.04] but our whole lives,
[1904.38 → 1905.30] living together
[1905.30 → 1908.06] as a chosen people of God.
[1908.06 → 1914.82] And I want to remind everyone here today,
[1915.60 → 1918.52] this new identity does not mean
[1918.52 → 1921.48] that we instantly become little Christs,
[1921.88 → 1924.60] which would result in the perfectly unified community anyway.
[1925.56 → 1925.92] Instead,
[1926.38 → 1928.82] it is a lifelong process
[1928.82 → 1930.66] of dying to ourselves
[1930.66 → 1931.96] and living in Christ.
[1933.08 → 1934.96] Galatians 2.20
[1934.96 → 1936.28] says this perfectly.
[1936.28 → 1938.64] We are a people who confess,
[1939.52 → 1941.72] I have been crucified with Christ.
[1942.02 → 1943.78] It is no longer I who live,
[1944.10 → 1945.52] but Christ who lives in me.
[1946.02 → 1948.62] And the life I now live in the flesh,
[1948.92 → 1950.02] I live by faith
[1950.02 → 1950.84] in the Son of God
[1950.84 → 1951.76] who loved me
[1951.76 → 1953.52] and gave himself for me.
[1954.78 → 1956.62] I know this is all in first person,
[1957.46 → 1959.16] but this is a confession
[1959.16 → 1961.72] of believers
[1961.72 → 1962.20] believers
[1962.20 → 1963.64] who confess that
[1963.64 → 1964.80] it is no longer
[1964.80 → 1966.44] we who live.
[1966.82 → 1967.76] It is not us
[1967.76 → 1969.46] who attains
[1969.46 → 1971.20] perfect love,
[1971.46 → 1972.96] but it is Christ
[1972.96 → 1973.78] who lives in me.
[1975.72 → 1977.24] For the Colossian church,
[1977.58 → 1978.44] Paul puts it as,
[1978.56 → 1980.20] as we looked at in verses 9-10,
[1980.20 → 1982.72] you have taken off
[1982.72 → 1983.54] your old self
[1983.54 → 1984.80] with its practices
[1984.80 → 1986.06] and have put on
[1986.06 → 1986.92] the new self,
[1987.52 → 1989.14] which is being renewed
[1989.14 → 1989.94] in knowledge
[1989.94 → 1990.60] in the image
[1990.60 → 1991.50] of its creator.
[1993.34 → 1995.84] We are being renewed.
[1997.00 → 1997.92] The stress
[1997.92 → 1998.88] and the emphasis
[1998.88 → 1999.86] must be on
[1999.86 → 2001.48] the continual,
[2001.74 → 2002.80] lifelong process
[2002.80 → 2004.22] of being renewed
[2004.22 → 2004.88] in Christ.
[2004.88 → 2007.20] if we want to go back
[2007.20 → 2008.68] to the citizenship imagery
[2008.68 → 2009.26] that I used
[2009.26 → 2009.80] at the beginning,
[2010.02 → 2010.96] we can think of it
[2010.96 → 2011.96] as how we still
[2011.96 → 2012.78] hold on to our
[2012.78 → 2013.96] old citizenships,
[2014.28 → 2015.36] our old passports,
[2015.54 → 2016.82] not wanting to let go.
[2018.54 → 2020.28] It is an ongoing process
[2020.28 → 2021.98] to die to our old selves
[2021.98 → 2023.22] and the already
[2023.22 → 2024.68] not, yet kingdom lives
[2024.68 → 2025.34] that we live
[2025.34 → 2026.22] as a community.
[2028.28 → 2029.02] And so,
[2029.30 → 2030.20] I suggest that
[2030.20 → 2030.90] if we do not
[2030.90 → 2032.40] emphasize this part
[2032.40 → 2033.72] of this identity
[2033.72 → 2034.26] of ours,
[2034.26 → 2034.94] how it is
[2034.94 → 2036.62] a lifelong process,
[2037.00 → 2037.66] but just give you
[2037.66 → 2038.24] another sermon
[2038.24 → 2039.02] on how to love
[2039.02 → 2039.48] one another
[2039.48 → 2040.40] and be kinder
[2040.40 → 2041.02] to one another
[2041.02 → 2042.02] and to forgive
[2042.02 → 2043.22] anyone who wrongs you,
[2043.40 → 2044.16] these are all
[2044.16 → 2046.02] necessary and obvious
[2046.02 → 2047.18] things that we must do
[2047.18 → 2048.20] as Christ followers.
[2049.70 → 2051.12] But we lose sight
[2051.12 → 2052.26] of our calling
[2052.26 → 2053.38] if weekly sermons
[2053.38 → 2054.32] are simple reminders
[2054.32 → 2055.94] of better moralistic
[2055.94 → 2056.82] or ethical living.
[2058.62 → 2059.70] Even the world
[2059.70 → 2060.56] around us
[2060.56 → 2061.76] accomplishes
[2061.76 → 2063.44] these loving acts
[2063.44 → 2063.82] better.
[2064.26 → 2065.50] or other religions
[2065.50 → 2066.54] as I have witnessed
[2066.54 → 2069.18] or even non-religious people.
[2070.02 → 2070.66] It's not like
[2070.66 → 2071.22] they all
[2071.22 → 2072.50] throw out all ethics
[2072.50 → 2073.04] and morals
[2073.04 → 2073.88] and live like
[2073.88 → 2075.26] animals or beasts.
[2076.54 → 2077.54] What are we trying
[2077.54 → 2078.12] to do then?
[2078.30 → 2079.40] Are we trying to compete
[2079.40 → 2081.16] to see who is more
[2081.16 → 2082.42] moralistic or ethical?
[2082.42 → 2082.48] biblical?
[2084.48 → 2085.00] No.
[2085.34 → 2086.14] For us,
[2086.54 → 2087.52] all these things
[2087.52 → 2088.38] are a reflection
[2088.38 → 2089.26] of our identity
[2089.26 → 2090.32] in Christ
[2090.32 → 2091.52] who are loved
[2091.52 → 2092.06] by Christ
[2092.06 → 2093.94] and are forgiven
[2093.94 → 2094.76] by Christ
[2094.76 → 2096.50] that reminds us
[2096.50 → 2097.34] of why
[2097.34 → 2098.96] we make every effort
[2098.96 → 2099.88] to love one another,
[2100.12 → 2101.24] to forgive one another.
[2103.18 → 2104.54] And we better realize
[2104.54 → 2105.82] that this is hard work.
[2105.82 → 2108.06] It requires
[2108.06 → 2109.06] every effort
[2109.06 → 2109.80] as Paul says
[2109.80 → 2110.58] to the Ephesians.
[2111.58 → 2112.18] He says,
[2112.70 → 2113.36] be completely
[2113.36 → 2114.56] humble and gentle.
[2115.08 → 2115.68] Be patient
[2115.68 → 2116.64] bearing one another
[2116.64 → 2117.14] in love.
[2117.34 → 2118.28] Almost exactly
[2118.28 → 2119.16] the same idea
[2119.16 → 2119.72] as he says
[2119.72 → 2120.46] to the Colossians.
[2120.90 → 2121.64] But he goes on
[2121.64 → 2122.04] to say,
[2122.90 → 2124.58] make every effort
[2124.58 → 2125.96] to keep the unity
[2125.96 → 2126.60] of the Spirit
[2126.60 → 2127.14] through the bond
[2127.14 → 2127.66] of peace.
[2128.72 → 2130.28] Make every effort
[2130.28 → 2131.62] because he knows
[2131.62 → 2132.40] we will struggle.
[2133.44 → 2134.02] He knows
[2134.02 → 2134.64] that we are
[2134.64 → 2135.84] a beautiful mess.
[2136.54 → 2137.26] We are very
[2137.26 → 2138.08] messed up.
[2139.30 → 2140.52] By definition,
[2141.20 → 2142.18] as a community,
[2142.88 → 2143.82] we are a group
[2143.82 → 2144.42] of people
[2144.42 → 2145.82] who all share
[2145.82 → 2146.74] something in common.
[2147.80 → 2149.08] What do we share
[2149.08 → 2149.64] in common?
[2150.56 → 2151.62] Our ability
[2151.62 → 2152.24] to forgive?
[2153.28 → 2154.82] Our humility levels?
[2155.72 → 2156.68] Our threshold
[2156.68 → 2157.38] for patience?
[2157.38 → 2158.18] Patience?
[2159.36 → 2160.42] I know I lack
[2160.42 → 2161.22] that part a lot.
[2162.92 → 2163.18] No.
[2163.50 → 2164.32] What we share
[2164.32 → 2164.84] in common
[2164.84 → 2166.10] first and foremost
[2166.10 → 2167.12] is our identity
[2167.12 → 2168.16] in Christ.
[2168.92 → 2169.98] The good news,
[2170.30 → 2170.70] the gospel,
[2170.86 → 2171.44] is that Jesus
[2171.44 → 2172.38] is compassionate.
[2173.00 → 2173.94] He is kind.
[2174.28 → 2175.30] He humbled himself
[2175.30 → 2176.38] to die on the cross.
[2176.76 → 2177.78] He is gentle
[2177.78 → 2178.38] and meek
[2178.38 → 2179.18] even for sinners.
[2179.80 → 2180.64] He is patient
[2180.64 → 2181.10] with us
[2181.10 → 2182.68] and he is the one
[2182.68 → 2183.36] who forgives.
[2184.52 → 2185.46] Christ has done
[2185.46 → 2186.34] the work of love
[2186.34 → 2186.98] to bring
[2186.98 → 2187.96] all of us
[2187.96 → 2188.62] as a people
[2188.62 → 2189.26] who identify
[2189.26 → 2190.08] in God's
[2190.08 → 2191.12] redemptive story
[2191.12 → 2192.28] for the whole world.
[2192.78 → 2193.74] And this is a gift.
[2194.22 → 2194.98] It is a gift
[2194.98 → 2195.78] given to us.
[2196.16 → 2196.76] Not something
[2196.76 → 2197.78] that we make up
[2197.78 → 2198.90] on our own efforts
[2198.90 → 2199.60] but something
[2199.60 → 2200.18] that is given
[2200.18 → 2201.08] to us as a gift.
[2201.58 → 2202.40] It is the gospel.
[2205.60 → 2206.40] And so as we come
[2206.40 → 2207.36] to a close this morning,
[2208.36 → 2209.46] we can reflect
[2209.46 → 2210.34] on how Paul
[2210.34 → 2211.52] encourages the church
[2211.52 → 2213.38] in verses 16 to 17
[2213.38 → 2214.86] of our Colossians text.
[2214.86 → 2214.90] Christ.
[2216.52 → 2217.78] Our whole lives
[2217.78 → 2218.66] belong to God.
[2219.56 → 2220.38] And so we are called
[2220.38 → 2220.96] to live out
[2220.96 → 2221.52] this identity
[2221.52 → 2222.16] as a people
[2222.16 → 2223.86] in a lifelong process
[2223.86 → 2225.40] of being formed
[2225.40 → 2226.28] into this body.
[2227.42 → 2228.88] This body of Christ
[2228.88 → 2230.94] reflects perfect unity
[2230.94 → 2232.06] where we all bear
[2232.06 → 2232.96] one another in love.
[2234.60 → 2235.70] And so be encouraged
[2235.70 → 2236.66] and be thankful
[2236.66 → 2237.54] that this community
[2237.54 → 2238.72] is made by Christ,
[2238.90 → 2239.78] not by us.
[2239.78 → 2242.56] That's why we are called
[2242.56 → 2243.54] to the peace of Christ
[2243.54 → 2245.20] which rules in our hearts
[2245.20 → 2246.02] as members
[2246.02 → 2247.90] of one unified body.
[2250.10 → 2251.36] And so I want to encourage
[2251.36 → 2252.40] our community this morning
[2252.40 → 2254.44] as we read in verse 16.
[2254.44 → 2257.16] Let this message of Christ,
[2257.30 → 2258.20] this good news,
[2258.72 → 2260.36] dwell among us richly
[2260.36 → 2261.12] as we teach
[2261.12 → 2262.30] and admonish one another
[2262.30 → 2264.36] through psalms, hymns,
[2264.44 → 2265.54] and songs from the Spirit,
[2266.02 → 2266.88] singing to God
[2266.88 → 2267.58] with gratitude
[2267.58 → 2268.48] in our hearts.
[2270.40 → 2271.60] And whatever you do,
[2271.96 → 2273.62] whether in word or deed,
[2274.14 → 2274.78] do it all
[2274.78 → 2275.38] in the name
[2275.38 → 2276.34] of the Lord Jesus,
[2276.84 → 2277.48] giving thanks
[2277.48 → 2278.98] to God the Father
[2278.98 → 2279.58] through Him.
[2283.16 → 2284.14] As a people
[2284.14 → 2285.56] who cherish this gospel
[2285.56 → 2287.42] and hold Christ in common,
[2288.80 → 2289.88] in whatever we do,
[2290.58 → 2291.92] so listening to God's word
[2291.92 → 2293.44] through sermons,
[2294.12 → 2294.82] worshipping God
[2294.82 → 2295.46] through music,
[2295.78 → 2296.26] through prayer,
[2296.58 → 2297.18] through fellowship,
[2297.58 → 2298.88] in our daily living,
[2299.96 → 2301.14] gathering or scattered,
[2301.26 → 2302.00] as we like to say,
[2302.38 → 2303.30] we do everything
[2303.30 → 2303.94] in the name
[2303.94 → 2304.76] of the Lord Jesus
[2304.76 → 2306.04] because we are
[2306.04 → 2307.00] His church.
[2309.68 → 2310.56] And so brothers
[2310.56 → 2311.60] and sisters of hope,
[2312.48 → 2314.28] may we bear one another
[2314.28 → 2314.90] in love
[2314.90 → 2316.30] and perfect unity.
[2317.50 → 2318.62] May we acknowledge
[2318.62 → 2319.40] our weakness
[2319.40 → 2320.90] and find comfort
[2320.90 → 2321.36] in the one
[2321.36 → 2322.06] who achieves
[2322.06 → 2323.46] this perfection for us,
[2324.14 → 2325.12] loving each other
[2325.12 → 2326.84] because God first
[2326.84 → 2327.66] loved us.
[2329.54 → 2330.32] Let's pray.
[2338.00 → 2338.86] Father God,
[2338.92 → 2339.56] we come to you
[2339.56 → 2340.14] this morning
[2340.14 → 2341.80] confessing how weak
[2341.80 → 2342.34] we are,
[2343.34 → 2344.50] how we lack
[2344.50 → 2345.42] so much, Lord,
[2345.96 → 2347.06] but you have decided
[2347.06 → 2347.94] to call us
[2347.94 → 2349.54] and to choose us
[2349.54 → 2351.52] and deem us
[2351.52 → 2353.04] holy and beloved.
[2355.00 → 2356.26] What else can we say
[2356.26 → 2356.92] but thanks?
[2359.06 → 2360.44] How can we be proud
[2360.44 → 2362.18] before you, Lord,
[2362.92 → 2363.82] who saved us
[2363.82 → 2365.20] while we were still sinners?
[2367.76 → 2369.26] And so let us reflect
[2369.26 → 2371.90] your love for us
[2371.90 → 2373.82] and help us
[2373.82 → 2374.48] to be united
[2374.48 → 2375.22] in this love
[2375.22 → 2375.92] for each other.
[2375.92 → 2378.08] we are called
[2378.08 → 2379.06] as a community, Lord.
[2379.40 → 2380.30] We are called
[2380.30 → 2380.92] as a body.
[2382.80 → 2383.58] Help us
[2383.58 → 2385.54] to be united together
[2385.54 → 2387.36] and hold you
[2387.36 → 2387.94] in common,
[2388.36 → 2389.54] not our abilities
[2389.54 → 2390.76] to forgive
[2390.76 → 2391.74] or our abilities
[2391.74 → 2392.54] or our levels
[2392.54 → 2393.74] to stay humble
[2393.74 → 2395.26] or to stay kind
[2395.26 → 2395.86] or gentle,
[2396.70 → 2397.24] but Lord,
[2397.58 → 2398.42] help us to reflect
[2398.42 → 2399.24] on you first
[2399.24 → 2401.14] and that you were perfect
[2401.14 → 2402.70] and that you have loved us.
[2403.76 → 2405.08] Let that identity
[2405.08 → 2406.54] flow naturally
[2406.54 → 2408.20] to our body
[2408.20 → 2409.36] as a community
[2409.36 → 2409.94] of believers
[2409.94 → 2412.08] to bear one another
[2412.08 → 2413.68] in that love
[2413.68 → 2414.62] that you have gifted
[2414.62 → 2415.30] for us.
[2416.52 → 2417.48] So we thank you
[2417.48 → 2418.72] for this gospel message
[2418.72 → 2420.84] and we want to give you
[2420.84 → 2421.66] all the glory
[2421.66 → 2423.44] of whatever we do
[2423.44 → 2424.58] in word or deed.
[2425.26 → 2425.90] May we do
[2425.90 → 2426.66] for your glory.
[2427.54 → 2428.22] May we do it
[2428.22 → 2429.20] all in your name.
[2430.52 → 2431.26] And that is the name
[2431.26 → 2432.70] we pray in this morning.
[2432.82 → 2433.60] In Jesus' name.
[2434.22 → 2434.52] Amen.
[2435.08 → 2439.82] Let's stand,
[2439.94 → 2440.28] shall we?
[2441.28 → 2442.18] And for those of you
[2442.18 → 2442.56] at home,
[2442.92 → 2443.80] we've spoken about
[2443.80 → 2444.46] being citizens
[2444.46 → 2445.10] of the kingdom
[2445.10 → 2446.84] and that yet
[2446.84 → 2448.42] the old world,
[2448.68 → 2449.60] our old citizenship
[2449.60 → 2450.36] is constantly
[2450.36 → 2451.50] trying to pull us back.
[2452.10 → 2452.84] Not only do they not
[2452.84 → 2453.62] insist we give up
[2453.62 → 2454.08] citizenship,
[2454.24 → 2454.96] they want us back.
[2455.48 → 2456.28] And we're always
[2456.28 → 2457.34] against that tension
[2457.34 → 2458.42] of being pulled back
[2458.42 → 2459.00] into the world.
[2459.24 → 2459.98] And we're subject
[2459.98 → 2460.50] to the world
[2460.50 → 2461.60] in that we may be
[2461.60 → 2462.12] dealing with
[2462.12 → 2463.20] COVID fatigue
[2463.20 → 2463.74] right now.
[2464.48 → 2465.46] We might be dealing
[2465.46 → 2466.22] with other problems
[2466.22 → 2466.96] that are enhanced
[2466.96 → 2467.88] or made worse
[2467.88 → 2468.74] by COVID.
[2469.24 → 2470.32] But all of that
[2470.32 → 2471.00] to say,
[2471.66 → 2472.90] we know the truth,
[2473.28 → 2473.78] the life,
[2474.26 → 2475.44] we know Jesus Christ.
[2475.76 → 2476.52] He is the way.
[2477.30 → 2478.52] And it's following him,
[2478.58 → 2479.82] the more we focus on him,
[2479.90 → 2480.70] the more those other
[2480.70 → 2481.54] things fall away.
[2481.54 → 2482.80] and the more we come
[2482.80 → 2483.34] in alignment
[2483.34 → 2485.04] with kingdom principles
[2485.04 → 2486.10] and living
[2486.10 → 2487.74] under the kingdom's promises.
[2488.00 → 2488.88] Let's worship together.
[2508.88 → 2510.96] Through every battle
[2510.96 → 2514.58] Through every heartbreak
[2514.58 → 2518.02] Through every circumstance

[2522.94 → 2524.60] my fortress
[2524.60 → 2527.56] Where you are my portion
[2527.56 → 2532.82] You are my hiding place
[2532.82 → 2537.28] I believe you are

[2569.18 → 2571.18] I take
[2571.18 → 2574.18] I believe
[2574.18 → 2575.68] That you are my provider
[2575.72 → 2576.30] I believe you are our provider
