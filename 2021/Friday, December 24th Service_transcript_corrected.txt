[0.00 → 7.46] I didn't even attempt the clapping.
[7.46 → 12.76] Milano was trying to tell me how, but no, no, not happening.
[12.76 → 14.96] It was awesome.
[14.96 → 18.04] Let's thank the musicians once again here.
[18.04 → 28.12] We are very blessed to have such talented people lead us.
[28.12 → 33.58] Good evening to you all here and online.
[33.58 → 38.56] Lot busier than last year when it was just a handful of us and just online.
[38.56 → 44.32] Once again though, we're having a challenging Christmas, but it still is Christmas.
[44.32 → 50.36] Christ came into the midst of the messiness of His day, and He comes in the midst of the
[50.36 → 51.36] messiness of our day.
[51.36 → 58.12] His day there was poverty and military occupations, no room in the inn, lots and lots of turmoil.
[58.12 → 64.58] We say Merry Christmas and when I look up the word merry, we get definitions like cheerful,
[64.58 → 66.58] happy, carefree.
[66.58 → 72.08] I guess I could ask you, are you feeling nowadays carefree?
[72.08 → 77.40] I get the sense a lot of people aren't feeling particularly carefree.
[77.40 → 82.88] During our Advent series, we were talking about blessedness, and so we've been saying blessed
[82.88 → 83.88] Christmas.
[83.88 → 88.34] Now that word can be a little bit trivial in the way it's used too, but it really means
[88.34 → 90.34] to be made holy.
[90.34 → 92.34] Blessed Christmas, to be made holy.
[92.34 → 99.12] In scripture, blessing is described as what God is doing for the sake of the world.
[99.12 → 101.34] Jesus described it this way in John's Gospel.
[101.34 → 105.34] He said, I have come that they may have life, you and I, to the full.
[105.34 → 107.80] That's what blessing is.
[107.80 → 111.80] Overturning the powers of darkness, enabling life to flourish again.
[111.80 → 118.80] And all this happens through a child born in obscurity.
[118.80 → 122.80] This child who came to bring blessings to the world.
[122.80 → 126.80] To somehow make us holy.
[126.80 → 129.26] That's what this is about.
[129.26 → 133.26] This has been a tough couple of years for many, many people.
[133.26 → 137.26] And everyone is genuinely tired of it all.
[137.26 → 142.26] And for some of you, this has been a year when you've experienced loss.
[142.26 → 143.26] The loss of a job.
[143.26 → 145.26] The loss of health.
[145.26 → 147.26] The loss of a loved one.
[147.26 → 153.22] My wife lost two brothers this past year.
[153.22 → 157.22] And so somehow this idea of merriment isn't going to cut it really.
[157.22 → 164.72] But blessedness, being made holy, somehow something about renewal, something about restoration.
[164.72 → 167.60] That's what we really need, isn't it?
[167.60 → 169.22] That's what we're really longing for.
[169.22 → 171.76] And that's what Jesus brings.
[171.76 → 174.30] We are celebrating as the candles signify.
[174.30 → 181.14] We're celebrating hope and love and joy and peace that comes through Emmanuel, God with us.
[181.14 → 189.76] I love that cello piece, you know, Emmanuel, where it moves us to realize how much we long for God.
[189.76 → 192.94] And how deep that goes in us.
[192.94 → 199.66] A lot of us come to services like this with a variety of emotions and circumstances.
[199.66 → 202.50] We're going to look at a passage now that...
[202.50 → 203.50] And you'll see...
[203.50 → 206.96] Take note of what are Mary's emotions in this passage.
[206.96 → 207.96] So look at it with me.
[207.96 → 209.84] Luke 1.
[209.84 → 216.38] In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town
[216.38 → 223.22] in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.
[223.22 → 225.32] The virgin's name was Mary.
[225.32 → 228.90] And the angel went to her and said, Greetings, you who are highly favoured.
[228.90 → 231.68] The Lord is with you.
[231.68 → 238.14] Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
[238.14 → 240.68] But the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary.
[240.68 → 242.48] You have found favour with God.
[242.48 → 247.64] You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.
[247.64 → 252.14] And it strikes me that Mary's emotions are troubled and fearful.
[252.14 → 258.38] So we come with a lot of emotions, different emotions, and that's typical of even Mary at
[258.38 → 262.10] her first incident of Christmas.
[262.10 → 265.64] I've been looking at the Christmas cards that we've been receiving.
[265.64 → 268.98] And thank you for those of you who sent us Christmas cards.
[268.98 → 271.06] They are a blessing.
[271.06 → 274.14] But there are interesting pictures and themes.
[274.14 → 277.14] I know it's all Christmas, but there are different ways of looking at it here.
[277.14 → 280.50] I'm going to look at a couple of typical ones.
[280.50 → 286.44] This first image, this first card, there are quite a few of these kinds of cards where you
[286.44 → 291.64] get this landscape scene and towns covered with snow.
[291.64 → 296.32] And yeah, we're supposed to be thinking, Oh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, which for
[296.32 → 302.76] those of us in British Columbia, we actually might have, which is exciting news for some.
[302.76 → 305.64] And others, well, they're a little nervous about snow.
[305.64 → 311.76] Because BC drivers are so used to snow.
[311.76 → 316.16] Another theme that we saw, that I looked at in some of the cards in this next slide, you
[316.16 → 318.24] know, that you have some animals in it.
[318.24 → 321.04] And somehow animals are part of this Christmas story.
[321.04 → 325.40] Or another theme, this third one, this third picture here, there are angels.
[325.40 → 328.10] And often they're cute angels.
[328.10 → 333.30] They don't look like the type of angel that visited Mary and would announce with some kind
[333.30 → 335.28] of authority, fear not.
[335.28 → 336.28] And somehow these angels...
[336.28 → 337.28] I don't know.
[337.28 → 341.40] Anyway, it doesn't look like a fear not type of angel.
[341.40 → 345.28] Other, other cards were focused on the Holy Family.
[345.28 → 346.80] And we see that here.
[346.80 → 348.94] And they're not kind of ordinary looking folk.
[348.94 → 353.28] They seem really serene and unruffled.
[353.28 → 355.40] Sometimes like here with golden halos.
[355.40 → 356.40] And I don't know.
[356.40 → 357.40] And I don't know.
[357.40 → 361.24] You often get the sense you wouldn't relate to these folk necessarily.
[361.24 → 363.24] They don't look like real people.
[363.24 → 366.00] And then we have the words inside the cards.
[366.00 → 368.00] And they're often sunny type words.
[368.00 → 370.64] Love, goodwill, cheer, merriment.
[370.64 → 371.58] All fine words.
[371.58 → 372.58] All fine words.
[372.58 → 375.74] You know, again, thank you for the cards.
[375.74 → 382.42] But somehow this isn't the whole story that we read about in the Gospels.
[382.42 → 384.74] The whole story of Christmas.
[384.74 → 387.74] I'm going to jump around a little bit in the Christmas story.
[387.74 → 389.74] I'm going to start with a guy named Simeon.
[389.74 → 394.62] He's an old guy in the temple who is told by God, you're not going to die until you see
[394.62 → 397.58] the promised Messiah.
[397.58 → 400.36] And he does see him when Jesus is brought to the temple.
[400.36 → 402.22] Here's the story out of Luke 2.
[402.22 → 403.22] Look at it with me.
[403.22 → 407.06] Moved by the Spirit, he, Simeon, went to the temple courts.
[407.06 → 413.46] And when the parents, Mary and Joseph there, brought in the child Jesus to do for him what
[413.46 → 419.26] was the custom of the law required, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God saying,
[419.26 → 424.14] Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace.
[424.44 → 425.46] He's now ready to die.
[426.24 → 432.10] For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations,
[432.10 → 437.72] a light up for revelation to the Gentiles, that's us, and the glory of your people Israel.
[438.24 → 441.86] And the child's father and mother marvelled at what was said about him.
[442.24 → 445.26] And then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother,
[445.26 → 452.58] This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, to be a sign
[452.58 → 459.20] that will be spoken against, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed, and the sword
[459.20 → 462.60] will pierce your soul too.
[464.28 → 467.74] Not the kind of words we see in Christmas cards, is it?
[467.74 → 471.20] Somehow a sword piercing her soul.
[471.34 → 477.06] And I picture Mary down the road there at the cross and watching her son die.
[477.86 → 483.10] And even Mary, at one point she sings this beautiful song called the Magnificat, a song
[483.10 → 487.64] of praise, and she praises God for his plans and his purposes.
[487.64 → 492.38] But she speaks of rulers overthrown and proud men scattered.
[492.38 → 496.28] Not themes we tend to see in Christmas cards.
[496.28 → 498.06] All because Jesus has come.
[498.38 → 505.56] In contrast to these Christmas cards, Christmas isn't sentimentalized as a simple, cozy life.
[506.10 → 511.04] It's a profoundly changed life that Christmas is about.
[511.32 → 513.92] A profoundly transformed life.
[515.84 → 520.84] And I can relate to Mary feeling troubled and afraid with the angel's appearance.
[520.84 → 524.92] For her, in part, it's surely about, you know, I'm a virgin, and I'm pregnant.
[525.00 → 525.80] How's that going to work?
[526.30 → 529.04] And this is a tough thing for Mary and Joseph.
[529.24 → 532.42] I mean, Jewish law even considered Mary an adulteress.
[534.38 → 537.56] Joseph's first reaction, here again, this Christmas story.
[537.92 → 542.84] Joseph's first reaction is he's going to quietly divorce her so as not to shame her.
[543.90 → 546.06] Until God straightens him out in a dream.
[546.46 → 549.42] And then he realizes that there's more going on than meets the eye.
[549.42 → 552.72] And then there's a census going on here, the Roman census.
[552.86 → 556.74] And everyone has to go register to their hometown, right?
[556.82 → 558.64] And it's a huge inconvenience.
[559.00 → 563.94] And the male head of the household would have sufficed for the Roman census.
[564.12 → 566.64] So Joseph could have gone on his own, it seems.
[567.16 → 570.68] And you wonder, why did he take Mary, his pregnant wife?
[571.10 → 576.24] Was this about kind of protecting her from giving birth back home after maybe, you know,
[576.24 → 578.16] nine months of scandal in her community?
[579.38 → 581.62] I mean, what's really happening here?
[582.00 → 588.98] And it seems that God had arranged pretty humiliating circumstances for his son's entrance into the world.
[590.68 → 593.52] A world full of challenges and difficulties.
[593.52 → 598.66] And yet, in spite of all that, Mary says to the angel,
[599.56 → 600.66] I am the Lord's servant.
[602.24 → 603.30] Yeah, I'm afraid.
[603.86 → 605.02] Yeah, I'm troubled.
[605.38 → 608.08] But I trust the Lord anyway.
[608.08 → 614.10] Often, I think, a work of God comes with two edges.
[614.26 → 616.08] It comes with great joy and great pain.
[616.54 → 618.30] And Mary embraces both.
[619.52 → 626.48] She's the first person to accept Jesus on his terms, regardless of personal cost.
[626.84 → 628.92] And there's huge personal cost for her.
[629.28 → 632.00] And we are called to do the same.
[632.00 → 640.70] I was reading about a Jesuit missionary named Mateo Rise.
[641.60 → 643.52] And he went to China in the 16th century.
[643.64 → 646.58] And he brought along art to illustrate the gospel stories.
[646.88 → 649.48] And help his communication to the Chinese people.
[650.04 → 655.12] The Chinese readily accepted portraits of the Virgin Mary holding her child.
[655.12 → 661.36] But the portraits of the crucified son, well, the audience reacted in horror.
[661.60 → 662.44] And that's understandable.
[662.80 → 667.46] Because they much preferred the Virgin instead of the crucified son.
[667.54 → 668.98] And they worshipped her.
[671.58 → 675.28] And I was thinking as I looked at all the Christmas cards,
[675.34 → 677.44] I realized that in a sense, we kind of do the same thing.
[677.72 → 683.60] We observe a mellow, cozy holiday purged of any hint of scandal and trouble.
[685.12 → 692.32] It fascinates me that some want to say happy holidays instead of merry Christmas.
[693.36 → 697.96] Forgetting that the word holidays comes from the word holy days.
[698.70 → 702.94] Again, Jesus has come to make us holy.
[703.80 → 707.20] So maybe saying happy holidays is actually more accurate.
[707.58 → 710.94] And he's come to make us holy through his birth, through his life, through his word,
[711.06 → 712.40] through his death, through his resurrection.
[712.40 → 716.00] Back to old man Simeon.
[716.66 → 721.54] He instinctively knew that the baby was the long-awaited Messiah.
[721.96 → 723.46] And that gave him great joy.
[723.82 → 726.86] And yet he said that conflict would surely follow.
[728.72 → 732.72] Mary was in some ways right to feel troubled.
[732.72 → 737.60] And Simeon said, yeah, that sword is going to pierce your soul.
[738.90 → 741.68] When Jesus is born, I mean, Herod rules.
[741.92 → 743.16] He's in charge, right?
[743.28 → 744.62] He's still cruel.
[745.22 → 750.22] He even goes after the babies of Bethlehem trying to kill the Christ child.
[750.60 → 752.04] Rome still occupied.
[752.60 → 755.22] Israel, poverty was still abounded.
[755.22 → 758.94] Joseph and Mary have to flee to Egypt.
[759.04 → 761.28] We heard that in the song that was sung here.
[761.60 → 764.92] They have to flee to Egypt because Herod wants the child dead.
[766.58 → 769.80] We don't see that on any Christmas cards, do we?
[769.86 → 771.78] And I'm not necessarily saying we should.
[772.88 → 775.32] But it is part of the gospel story of Christmas.
[775.32 → 781.78] And later, later on, an angel comes to Joseph and Mary when they're in Egypt.
[781.94 → 783.00] Say, hey, it's safe to go home.
[783.44 → 784.28] Herod has died.
[785.86 → 786.84] Herod's son takes over.
[786.92 → 790.80] And eventually there's a guy named Pontius Pilate who's in charge.
[791.46 → 796.44] And ironically, he seems to figure out how to kill this child, Jesus, who is now a man.
[796.86 → 798.74] And thus ending the story, right?
[798.84 → 800.16] I mean, surely that was the end of it.
[800.50 → 802.02] And of course, we know that's not true.
[802.02 → 807.64] Because Christ's coming and his death changes everything.
[809.46 → 810.06] Everything.
[814.06 → 816.04] There's so much conflict in the story.
[817.18 → 820.42] And yet we remember Mary's words, right?
[820.52 → 822.62] She sings this beautiful song of praise.
[822.76 → 827.48] But in it, she says, when Jesus comes, he'll bring down rulers from their thrones.
[827.56 → 828.82] And he'll lift the humble.
[832.02 → 836.62] I wonder if Mary, you know, I'm sure she did, doubted at some times that this baby of hers,
[836.96 → 841.80] who had been hunted and who was helpless, could possibly fulfill all the lavish hopes that people had
[841.80 → 843.64] and all the promises of God.
[846.14 → 847.82] Blessed Christmas.
[848.78 → 853.64] We are made holy because Christ has come to bring life in all its fullness.
[853.64 → 855.64] That's what's going on.
[859.00 → 866.34] There's one other story of Christmas that you'll never see on any Christmas cards.
[866.86 → 868.58] I sometimes picture sending this one.
[869.14 → 877.52] It's in Revelations 12, where we get a glimpse of the Christmas story from a heavenly perspective.
[877.52 → 881.24] Here's a picture.
[881.68 → 883.44] I tried to find a perfect one.
[883.50 → 884.98] This is the best I could come up with.
[885.60 → 887.12] How about getting that Christmas card?
[888.86 → 889.82] Yeah, kind of interesting, right?
[889.86 → 891.26] How is it a Christmas card, Sid?
[891.30 → 892.08] Well, let me tell you.
[892.84 → 896.36] I know it doesn't look like the gospel birth story at all.
[896.42 → 897.08] There are no shepherds.
[897.14 → 897.90] There's no King Herod.
[898.30 → 903.00] Rather, it's obviously a picture of a dragon leading a ferocious struggle in heaven.
[903.00 → 908.64] And there's this woman, and she's clothed with the sun and wearing a crown of 12 stars.
[908.84 → 912.60] And she's crying out in pain as she's about to give birth.
[913.78 → 916.64] And the enormous red dragon enters the scene,
[917.38 → 921.76] his tail sweeping stars out of the sky and flinging them to the earth.
[922.72 → 927.50] And he crouches hungrily before the woman, ready to devour her child.
[927.50 → 934.24] But at the last moment, the child is snatched away safely, and the woman flees.
[934.66 → 937.92] And an all-out cosmic war begins.
[939.76 → 944.18] You ever picture Christmas as the start of a cosmic war?
[946.58 → 948.28] Revelations, it's a strange book.
[948.60 → 950.64] And you have to understand its style to make sense of it.
[950.64 → 958.00] But what stands out to me is that the ruler of the forces of good, God himself, fights and unseats evil.
[959.60 → 963.04] Because that's what's going on in this story.
[964.14 → 965.64] In the Christmas story.
[967.30 → 970.92] J.B. Phillips, he wrote a version of the Bible, a Good News for Modern Man version.
[970.92 → 974.86] And he also writes a story about two angels talking about the Christmas story.
[975.66 → 978.74] And they're looking down on planet earth.
[979.90 → 983.52] And this is what one angel says to the other.
[984.32 → 987.60] And he says, do you mean our great and glorious prince, Jesus,
[988.08 → 991.54] went down in person to this fifth-rate little planet?
[992.40 → 993.72] Why would he do a thing like that?
[994.76 → 998.04] And that little angel face wrinkled in disgust.
[998.04 → 1005.42] I mean, do you mean to tell me that he stooped so low as to become one of those creeping, crawling creatures on that floating ball?
[1006.68 → 1008.24] The other angel replied, I do.
[1008.60 → 1013.36] And I don't think he would like you to call them creeping, crawling creatures in that tone of voice.
[1014.14 → 1018.42] For strange as it may seem to us, he loves them.
[1020.08 → 1025.72] And he went down to visit them, to lift them up, to become like him.
[1028.04 → 1029.44] And the little angel looked blank.
[1030.26 → 1033.72] Because such a thought was almost beyond his comprehension.
[1035.38 → 1037.90] And to be honest with you, it's beyond my comprehension too.
[1038.52 → 1042.40] That God would love us that much and want so much for us.
[1042.40 → 1045.78] The truth is this.
[1046.36 → 1051.48] We live in so much more than we actually see and observe around us.
[1051.88 → 1057.04] Yeah, our world consists of lakes and mountains and snow and politics and war and COVID.
[1057.32 → 1059.64] And people working and walking and doing life.
[1060.08 → 1062.68] And yet, somehow there are angels at work.
[1062.88 → 1064.44] And there are evil forces at work.
[1064.44 → 1068.28] And one cold night among the hills of Bethlehem.
[1068.60 → 1072.46] These two worlds come together in a profoundly dramatic intersection.
[1073.08 → 1078.66] And God, who is not bound by time and space, enters time and space to be with us.
[1078.86 → 1083.88] Emmanuel, the God who knew no boundaries, became a baby.
[1083.88 → 1090.82] I'm going to give you a picture of how this baby really looks.
[1091.52 → 1093.80] According to the Apostle Paul in Colossians.
[1093.88 → 1094.62] Look at it with me.
[1096.22 → 1097.04] Colossians 1.
[1097.28 → 1097.86] We read.
[1098.44 → 1099.88] This is the baby Jesus.
[1099.88 → 1102.82] The Son is the image of the invisible God.
[1103.28 → 1104.90] The firstborn over all creation.
[1105.58 → 1107.36] For in him all things were created.
[1107.52 → 1108.66] Things in heaven and on earth.
[1108.74 → 1109.58] Visible and invisible.
[1110.10 → 1112.64] Whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities.
[1112.64 → 1115.98] All things have been created through him and for him.
[1117.22 → 1118.76] He is before all things.
[1118.90 → 1120.60] And in him all things hold together.
[1121.60 → 1123.38] He is the head of the body, the church.
[1123.48 → 1125.66] He is the beginning and the firstborn among the dead.
[1125.74 → 1129.22] So that in everything he might have supremacy.
[1130.24 → 1133.28] For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him.
[1134.00 → 1137.16] And through him to reconcile to himself all things.
[1137.36 → 1138.96] Whether things on earth or in heaven.
[1139.22 → 1141.76] By making peace through his bloodshed on the cross.
[1141.76 → 1144.38] And once you were alienated from that God.
[1144.76 → 1147.74] And were enemies in your mind because of your evil behaviour.
[1148.12 → 1152.66] But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death.
[1153.00 → 1153.74] To present you.
[1153.78 → 1154.28] And here we go.
[1154.74 → 1155.24] Holy.
[1157.14 → 1158.60] Holy in his sight.
[1159.10 → 1160.94] Without blemish and free from accusation.
[1162.82 → 1165.88] That's who's born on Christmas.
[1165.88 → 1171.56] So much more than no crying he made in a manger.
[1172.98 → 1175.00] And did you hear it in Christ.
[1175.36 → 1177.28] In Christ you are holy.
[1177.60 → 1178.40] You are blessed.
[1179.12 → 1181.34] That's what's happening because Christ coming on Christmas.
[1181.76 → 1183.14] So much more than Mary.
[1183.44 → 1187.66] The irony though is that it makes me feel Mary deep, deep down.
[1187.92 → 1189.68] That merriness is probably more joy.
[1189.68 → 1192.50] Because Emmanuel, God with us.
[1192.90 → 1193.52] In all.
[1193.84 → 1194.48] Through all.
[1194.96 → 1199.64] Lifting us up to holiness and blessing forever and ever.
[1201.18 → 1201.92] Let's pray.
[1205.86 → 1207.66] Lord God we come before you.
[1207.66 → 1210.52] Lord we thank you.
[1212.74 → 1214.30] For becoming one of us.
[1216.30 → 1218.70] Lord we thank you that you became one of us.
[1218.76 → 1221.16] In order to bring us to yourself.
[1222.42 → 1225.12] In order to bring us profound blessing.
[1225.28 → 1226.90] In order to make us holy.
[1227.50 → 1230.12] So that we could be a blessing in the world around us.
[1231.16 → 1233.68] Lord help us not to minimize Christmas.
[1233.68 → 1240.34] But to see the profoundness of all things coming together in you.
[1241.54 → 1242.82] Father we praise you.
[1242.96 → 1246.34] And we thank you for being our Lord and our Saviour and our God.
[1246.98 → 1249.88] And we thank you for your profound deep love.
[1250.66 → 1251.80] May we Lord in turn.
[1252.56 → 1254.30] Live out of that love and share that love.
[1254.86 → 1255.56] In Jesus name.
[1256.08 → 1256.32] Amen.
[1256.32 → 1256.44] Amen.
[1259.94 → 1263.74] We're going to have a blessing in a moment here.
[1264.72 → 1266.64] But before I give you that blessing.
[1266.92 → 1268.86] You received a candle.
[1270.22 → 1274.30] And the image that we want to share here.
[1274.44 → 1276.18] Is that I'm going to take the candle.
[1276.28 → 1277.36] The Christ candle.
[1278.14 → 1279.66] I'm going to light a couple of candles.
[1280.86 → 1282.62] And share the light of Christ.
[1282.62 → 1285.54] And then you in turn will go to somebody near you.
[1285.84 → 1286.80] And light their candle.
[1287.32 → 1290.10] And we have this picture of what Christ came to do.
[1290.50 → 1294.40] To share the light of his love to the world around us.
[1294.84 → 1296.70] And the picture then that would carry on.
[1296.76 → 1299.54] Is that we would go out with that into the world around us.
[1300.34 → 1303.50] And so we'll hear a song during this time.
[1303.90 → 1305.38] And then I will give you a blessing.
[1305.38 → 1305.46] Amen.
[1305.46 → 1305.50] Amen.
