[0.00 --> 10.12]  Dave, it's a delight for me to be able to say a few words now at your installation as a senior pastor at Hope CRC.
[11.22 --> 15.92]  I still remember 12 years ago or so when you came to Burnaby,
[16.28 --> 24.90]  and you came as a pastor of youth and working in discipleship and working there with me and another senior pastor.
[24.90 --> 28.36]  And I still remember you coming for the first time.
[28.36 --> 30.84]  I still remember your first sermon.
[31.04 --> 34.82]  I still remember you beginning to learn the ropes of being a pastor.
[35.74 --> 40.46]  And so it's wonderful for me to see what's happened over the last 12 years,
[40.64 --> 48.28]  how you've grown not only as a Christian but also in terms of the gifts that God has given you as a pastor.
[48.66 --> 55.12]  And so it's wonderful to see this time come when you're being installed as a senior pastor.
[55.12 --> 60.28]  And now the hard work of a senior pastor begins.
[61.58 --> 71.68]  Perhaps it might be helpful to understand the calling that God has given you in terms of the words of a church historian
[71.68 --> 78.42]  who's a historian of the ancient church or the early church, the church in the first 300 years.
[78.42 --> 83.82]  Describing the ministry of the church in the first 300 years,
[83.94 --> 97.36]  he says that leaders saw their task as detoxifying the congregation from the idolatry of the Roman cultural story
[97.36 --> 101.88]  and replacing that cultural story with the biblical story,
[101.88 --> 110.28]  with the story of the Old Testament to find its climactic fulfillment and conclusion in the person of Jesus Christ.
[110.84 --> 121.84]  I like that image of detoxifying the congregation from the toxic idolatry of the cultural story.
[121.84 --> 132.32]  And I like the idea of the task of a leader of helping their congregation live more and more into the biblical story.
[132.94 --> 137.34]  Maybe that's a way for you to see the job that lies ahead of you.
[138.28 --> 141.70]  It's going to involve a lot of dimensions as a leader.
[141.96 --> 143.60]  Certainly it will involve preaching.
[143.88 --> 145.10]  It will involve teaching.
[145.66 --> 150.74]  It will involve helping to structure worship so that it is a formative event.
[150.74 --> 154.80]  It will certainly involve pastoral care and discipleship.
[155.08 --> 157.20]  It will mean leading by example.
[158.14 --> 164.84]  And it will mean that all of these things must be undergird by prayer and a dependence on the Holy Spirit
[164.84 --> 171.48]  because all of these things can only work as they are instruments in the hands of God
[171.48 --> 178.36]  and only as the Holy Spirit works in and through them to detoxify the congregation
[178.36 --> 182.94]  and to reshape them in the story of the Bible.
[184.02 --> 186.24]  My prayer is that you would be faithful,
[186.98 --> 191.58]  that you would take on the task that God has given you with a sense, first of all,
[191.64 --> 193.66]  of the inadequacy of your own abilities,
[193.92 --> 196.98]  but also a confidence in the gifts that God has given you
[196.98 --> 202.68]  and a confidence that His Spirit will work in and through you insofar as you are faithful.
[202.68 --> 208.34]  Dave, put yourself into the task of being a good pastor
[208.34 --> 215.06]  with the efforts, the prayers, the preaching, the teaching, the pastoral care
[215.06 --> 220.16]  that will help this congregation live more and more faithfully
[220.16 --> 222.08]  into the vocation they've been given
[222.08 --> 226.74]  to follow Jesus Christ, to live in the biblical story for the sake of the world.
[227.42 --> 230.70]  And may the Lord bless you in your vocation.
[232.68 --> 235.84]  Good morning, Hope Church.
[235.98 --> 241.36]  I've been asked to say a couple of words about your new lead pastor, Dave Groon,
[241.46 --> 245.34]  my colleague, and I am more than delighted to do so
[245.34 --> 249.96]  and then to also offer a prayer for him as he enters into this new phase of ministry.
[250.82 --> 256.00]  I had the great good fortune a while back, several years ago in fact,
[256.00 --> 259.54]  of being appointed to be Dave's sermon evaluator.
[259.54 --> 263.40]  So I had to read two of Dave's sermons at that point in time.
[264.16 --> 267.72]  Shortly thereafter, I was also appointed to examine Dave
[267.72 --> 273.48]  prior to becoming a candidate for ministry in the Christian Reformed Church,
[273.52 --> 275.50]  which I did with two other people.
[276.62 --> 279.32]  And the thing that I learned right there and then
[279.32 --> 281.96]  is that Dave was a most impressive person,
[282.18 --> 285.34]  both as I read his sermons and evaluated them,
[285.34 --> 289.56]  and then also as we had the pleasure of sitting down in a more intimate atmosphere
[289.56 --> 293.62]  and examining him, that Dave is very, very impressive.
[294.12 --> 299.84]  He's got a very sharp mind and a wonderful grasp of theology and the story of Scripture
[299.84 --> 301.42]  and listening to him is a pleasure,
[302.02 --> 303.82]  not only because he's smart,
[303.96 --> 307.64]  but also because he always carries around this gorgeous smile on his face.
[307.70 --> 309.74]  Even when the subject matter is quite serious,
[310.24 --> 311.92]  Dave has a smile on his face,
[311.92 --> 314.64]  which is disarming and always inviting.
[315.84 --> 318.48]  The idea that Dave is impressive
[318.48 --> 320.60]  and my conviction that he is impressive
[320.60 --> 323.48]  was solidified when I also had the pleasure
[323.48 --> 327.26]  of being at Dave's ordination exam before all of classes.
[327.48 --> 328.78]  And I remember distinctly,
[328.90 --> 331.74]  not only the answers that he gave to many of these questions,
[331.74 --> 334.92]  but also a person who was there,
[335.08 --> 336.92]  who was well into their 60s,
[337.54 --> 338.96]  maybe even their early 70s,
[338.96 --> 342.60]  and they turned to another person who was sitting there after Dave's exam
[342.60 --> 343.02]  and said,
[343.38 --> 343.78]  you know,
[344.26 --> 349.52]  that was the single best classical exam I have ever been a part of.
[349.96 --> 352.28]  And I can say from my own point of view too,
[352.92 --> 354.34]  that I agreed wholeheartedly.
[355.40 --> 356.70]  Dave is most impressive.
[356.70 --> 360.52]  The most impressive thing about him
[360.52 --> 364.18]  and the reason why I am so grateful that he is your pastor though
[364.18 --> 366.30]  is not because he's impressive in those ways,
[366.42 --> 370.88]  but because he genuinely loves the Lord Jesus Christ
[370.88 --> 373.70]  and wants to communicate the gospel of our Savior
[373.70 --> 376.46]  and is gifted at doing so.
[376.60 --> 379.16]  And I'm so grateful for the person who Dave is
[379.16 --> 381.28]  and that he is at Hope Church
[381.28 --> 383.98]  and that I have the opportunity to work alongside him
[383.98 --> 387.84]  in hopefully the weeks and months and years ahead.
[388.58 --> 392.72]  It's my privilege here to offer a prayer,
[392.86 --> 393.58]  so let's do that.
[394.98 --> 396.18]  Dear Lord God,
[396.70 --> 398.84]  joining together with my sisters and brothers
[398.84 --> 400.30]  at Hope Christian Reformed Church,
[400.40 --> 405.58]  I ask that you would prepare Dave for ministry,
[406.04 --> 408.82]  ongoing ministry at Hope Christian Reformed Church,
[408.82 --> 412.62]  that you would give him all the gifts that are necessary
[412.62 --> 414.78]  in order to lead well now
[414.78 --> 418.26]  and to continue doing what he has been doing there
[418.26 --> 420.70]  along with Sid and the other leadership of the church.
[421.48 --> 424.60]  Father, I also pray for Brittany as his spouse
[424.60 --> 427.68]  that you would give her all that she stands in need of
[427.68 --> 429.10]  as she stands beside Dave
[429.10 --> 431.94]  and she offers her great gifts too
[431.94 --> 434.98]  to advance your mission at Hope Church.
[434.98 --> 438.26]  Lord, send your spirit in great abundance.
[438.56 --> 440.66]  Phil, Dave, and Brittany as well.
[441.38 --> 443.58]  Lord, as they seek to minister at that church,
[444.10 --> 447.92]  we ask that your power would be upon him,
[448.12 --> 451.10]  that you would give him the words to speak
[451.10 --> 453.24]  at the time he needs to speak them,
[453.38 --> 455.70]  that you would protect him from the evil one, O Lord,
[456.26 --> 458.96]  and give him great joy in the journey.
[460.20 --> 463.00]  Lord, we thank you for giving us days like these
[463.00 --> 465.46]  where we can celebrate, where we can turn to you
[465.46 --> 467.50]  and see that you are a God who is faithful
[467.50 --> 470.04]  in your providence, in providing everything
[470.04 --> 471.20]  we stand in need of.
[471.72 --> 473.52]  Even in these strange days, Lord,
[473.90 --> 475.56]  we know that you are the faithful one.
[475.96 --> 477.48]  You are our good, good Father.
[477.74 --> 481.24]  And so we give you, as Dave is installed
[481.24 --> 483.62]  as lead pastor today, we give you all the praise
[483.62 --> 485.50]  and the honor and the glory.
[486.34 --> 488.38]  And all God's people say, amen.
[488.38 --> 491.90]  Hi, this is Pastor Chris Westby from Sunrise Church
[491.90 --> 494.40]  coming to you from my self-isolation in my house.
[494.98 --> 497.60]  It's with great pleasure that I greet you on video today
[497.60 --> 498.82]  at Hope Community Church.
[499.04 --> 501.18]  I'm so very excited for you guys in this next season,
[501.70 --> 502.98]  having had the wonderful leadership
[502.98 --> 504.70]  of Sid and Candy for years
[504.70 --> 505.94]  and now coming into the leadership
[505.94 --> 507.34]  of Pastor Dave and Brittany.
[508.00 --> 510.22]  I've had the privilege to know Dave
[510.22 --> 512.02]  for a number of years since he came to Hope.
[512.10 --> 514.08]  We had a lunch and little did we know
[514.08 --> 515.68]  that it would spark a great friendship
[515.68 --> 519.56]  and also a great co-laboring for the kingdom together.
[520.00 --> 521.56]  We love and honor these guys
[521.56 --> 524.44]  and we're very excited for you as a church.
[524.90 --> 526.70]  One of the scriptures that I was meditating on
[526.70 --> 529.24]  knowing that this day of installation was coming
[529.24 --> 530.62]  is Hebrews 13, 7.
[531.20 --> 533.60]  And it's a unique, sorry, Hebrews 13, 17.
[533.86 --> 534.74]  And it's a unique verse,
[534.82 --> 537.70]  but it has one central piece that I wanna bring today.
[538.32 --> 540.22]  It says, obey your leaders and submit to them
[540.22 --> 542.20]  for they are keeping watch over your souls
[542.20 --> 543.80]  as those who will have to give an account.
[544.44 --> 546.34]  Let them do this with joy and not with groaning
[546.34 --> 548.52]  for that would be of no advantage to you.
[549.10 --> 551.98]  On first reading, you think that this is a letter
[551.98 --> 555.44]  or a note to a church who's not respecting their leaders
[555.44 --> 556.78]  and not following their leaders,
[557.04 --> 559.30]  but really it gives a great idea
[559.30 --> 561.62]  of what pastoral leaders are supposed to do.
[562.34 --> 564.54]  They are keeping watch over your souls.
[565.24 --> 567.08]  So right within the admonishment to the church
[567.08 --> 569.56]  is the encouragement and the admonishment to the pastors.
[569.72 --> 571.62]  Dave and Brittany, you have been given charge
[571.62 --> 573.92]  to watch over the souls of Hope Community Church.
[574.08 --> 575.98]  And in the parish area of Clayton.
[576.22 --> 578.54]  And I implore you and encourage you to do that
[578.54 --> 580.34]  to the best of your God-given abilities
[580.34 --> 581.66]  with the team around you
[581.66 --> 583.38]  and with the church you have behind you.
[583.74 --> 586.14]  And for you, church, God encourages us
[586.14 --> 589.52]  through this passage to submit to their leadership
[589.52 --> 590.90]  with joy and not without groaning.
[591.00 --> 593.60]  Because as you come alongside these great leaders
[593.60 --> 594.68]  that God has put in your life,
[595.00 --> 597.98]  it's a benefit to you to serve alongside them.
[598.62 --> 599.82]  And I just want to speak on behalf
[599.82 --> 601.70]  of the Colorado pastors in our region.
[601.84 --> 603.88]  We've had a great fellowship of pastors.
[604.04 --> 605.38]  In fact, some of my best friends
[605.38 --> 606.94]  are the pastors in this region.
[607.10 --> 608.66]  And I believe the same for Dave as well.
[609.16 --> 611.14]  And we're just blessed to see as pastors,
[611.28 --> 612.70]  Dave and Brittany, step into this calling
[612.70 --> 617.04]  and to walk successfully after such a great building stage
[617.04 --> 617.88]  and growth stage.
[618.24 --> 620.82]  And even the practical building with Pastor Sid and Candy
[620.82 --> 622.10]  and the whole leadership team there.
[622.10 --> 624.86]  So I want to bless you on behalf of all the pastors.
[625.00 --> 627.64]  I want to bless you personally as a friend and a co-pastor.
[627.74 --> 628.98]  And let me pray for you guys today.
[629.88 --> 631.76]  Father, we thank you for Hope Community Church.
[632.18 --> 635.12]  We thank you that there are great days ahead, Lord,
[635.18 --> 637.04]  as they set their minds on the things
[637.04 --> 640.36]  that you have your heart set on for this church.
[640.74 --> 643.08]  Lord, we believe you put them on an influential place,
[643.24 --> 645.18]  not only in the community, but physically,
[645.36 --> 647.14]  you've put them on an influential place, Father,
[647.64 --> 649.04]  to be influencers in the neighborhood,
[649.24 --> 650.86]  in the community, the city, and the region.
[650.86 --> 653.46]  So Lord, we ask for a new anointing
[653.46 --> 655.56]  to come upon Pastor Dave and Brittany
[655.56 --> 657.38]  for this new appointment, Father God.
[657.92 --> 659.62]  Take them up a level in their leadership
[659.62 --> 661.06]  and in their service of the kingdom.
[661.38 --> 664.00]  Take them up a notch in their wisdom and their discernment.
[664.46 --> 666.26]  Take them up a notch in their ability
[666.26 --> 668.02]  to hear and discern from Holy Spirit
[668.02 --> 670.60]  and to convey those messages into the church
[670.60 --> 673.42]  to bring encouragement, admonishment, and challenge.
[673.94 --> 676.02]  And help them, Lord, to keep the main thing,
[676.08 --> 678.84]  the main thing that is Jesus and his mission.
[678.84 --> 680.76]  Lord, I pray that their installation
[680.76 --> 683.06]  will result in fruit in many lives,
[683.28 --> 685.68]  people growing, people coming to know Jesus,
[685.98 --> 687.86]  and ultimately you reviving the hearts
[687.86 --> 690.78]  of many lost people in our neighborhoods and region.
[691.26 --> 693.08]  We pray this in the great name of Jesus.
[693.88 --> 694.14]  Amen.
[695.22 --> 695.94]  God bless.
[695.94 --> 700.80]  There we go.
[701.60 --> 703.10]  This is a special service.
[704.54 --> 707.98]  And this is a time we commission Pastor Dave
[707.98 --> 709.84]  as lead pastor of Hope Community Church.
[710.32 --> 710.84]  Some of you might say,
[710.90 --> 712.46]  what does this commission thing mean?
[713.02 --> 715.48]  And I looked up some of the definitions of commission.
[717.04 --> 718.26]  One was to appoint.
[718.82 --> 720.48]  Another definition was authorize.
[720.48 --> 722.10]  I kind of like this one.
[722.24 --> 724.36]  Formerly chose for a special work.
[726.38 --> 728.16]  I think that one fits the best for me.
[729.42 --> 732.28]  Dave and I have been calling it the transition service,
[732.72 --> 735.22]  where we're going to go from one lead pastor,
[735.40 --> 735.82]  this one,
[736.78 --> 737.78]  to this lead pastor.
[738.90 --> 741.66]  Kind of made me think of my days as a teacher,
[741.78 --> 743.04]  an elementary school teacher,
[743.38 --> 745.38]  and teaching the kids doing track
[745.38 --> 746.84]  how to do relays well.
[746.84 --> 750.74]  And often it came down to the transfer of the baton.
[751.78 --> 752.90]  If you did it right,
[753.04 --> 755.94]  it was a seamless run from one runner to the other
[755.94 --> 758.48]  with no slowing down at all.
[759.10 --> 763.28]  And I think we're doing a good job of passing the baton.
[763.66 --> 765.52]  I am ready to pass the baton.
[766.36 --> 767.12]  To you, Dave,
[767.86 --> 768.74]  don't drop it.
[770.60 --> 772.14]  I know you'll run well.
[773.08 --> 775.52]  And I too want to keep running,
[775.52 --> 776.72]  just not quite as hard.
[777.84 --> 779.30]  And I was thinking about the baton.
[780.16 --> 782.58]  I picture it being the vision
[782.58 --> 784.34]  that God gave this faith community.
[785.88 --> 790.02]  Hope Community started as a church plant in 1987.
[791.24 --> 792.44]  There were 20 of us.
[793.58 --> 795.28]  We started with a vision
[795.28 --> 797.90]  to connect to the community around us
[797.90 --> 799.58]  in deep and meaningful ways.
[800.70 --> 804.64]  We actually made 20,000 phone calls.
[804.64 --> 807.48]  We had a group of people from other churches helping us.
[807.76 --> 811.34]  20,000 cold calls to the community around.
[811.64 --> 814.24]  And it was quite an undertaking.
[815.54 --> 816.64]  I have...
[816.64 --> 817.64]  These are all...
[818.28 --> 820.02]  Or some of the...
[820.02 --> 820.46]  We had...
[820.46 --> 821.64]  They're called response cards.
[821.74 --> 822.78]  And when you made the phone call,
[823.14 --> 826.54]  you were going to offer a package to be mailed to them
[826.54 --> 829.34]  about the church and its vision and its programs,
[829.34 --> 831.70]  and then invite them to the very first service.
[831.80 --> 833.52]  So you phoned just to say,
[833.80 --> 834.80]  will you...
[834.80 --> 837.66]  Are you willing to have a mail-out?
[838.20 --> 839.58]  Out of the 20,000 phone calls,
[839.64 --> 841.80]  the idea was 2,000 people would say yes,
[842.06 --> 843.62]  and out of those 2,200,
[843.80 --> 844.78]  might come to the first service.
[844.78 --> 847.02]  And it kind of worked out that way.
[847.58 --> 848.20]  But I tell you,
[848.24 --> 850.52]  there was a lot of rejection in 20,000 phone calls.
[851.52 --> 853.76]  These are about 30 years old.
[853.84 --> 855.88]  I've had them in my house in a box.
[856.38 --> 857.90]  I don't know what to do with them.
[858.28 --> 859.58]  But I was reading through some of them,
[859.70 --> 860.78]  and here's...
[860.78 --> 863.52]  So this person, a volunteer, makes a call,
[864.02 --> 865.44]  and then sometimes they had a comment
[865.44 --> 868.04]  if somebody said something significant in a comment.
[868.18 --> 869.74]  And here's what one person said.
[869.80 --> 870.86]  I won't do names.
[871.54 --> 873.64]  It said the comment from the person recording
[873.64 --> 874.62]  on the response card.
[875.08 --> 876.68]  This is the Jehovah Witness person,
[877.30 --> 878.04]  and the person said,
[878.18 --> 879.06]  go ahead, mail it,
[879.14 --> 880.46]  but I'm not coming to your first service.
[880.98 --> 882.98]  So that's the kind of thing you got.
[883.08 --> 884.28]  Or here was another comment
[884.28 --> 887.66]  that says, sure, send it,
[887.78 --> 889.96]  but I've had bad experiences with churches.
[890.32 --> 892.22]  I'm actively involved in the community already.
[893.18 --> 894.02]  Here's another one.
[894.40 --> 895.66]  Yeah, I used to go to church,
[895.66 --> 898.34]  but the Sunday school teacher smoked pot.
[899.72 --> 900.96]  I want to go to church,
[901.10 --> 902.74]  but I don't know where to go after that.
[902.74 --> 905.34]  So there's kind of an interesting response.
[905.76 --> 906.66]  I can assure you all,
[906.78 --> 908.30]  our Sunday school teachers don't smoke pot.
[909.28 --> 910.12]  And then one more.
[910.90 --> 911.48]  This one was,
[911.72 --> 912.88]  this woman has four kids.
[912.98 --> 914.04]  She's a single mom.
[914.36 --> 916.32]  She's going through a rough time right now,
[916.70 --> 919.90]  really looking forward to hearing from us.
[919.90 --> 926.06]  And I was thinking about that.
[927.38 --> 928.06]  First of all,
[928.30 --> 929.80]  imagine 20,000 phone calls.
[929.88 --> 930.64]  That's quite something.
[931.68 --> 933.50]  But those people are still out there.
[934.90 --> 936.36]  They're still hurting people out there.
[936.50 --> 938.84]  They're still people who have been hurt by churches
[938.84 --> 940.18]  or hurt by circumstances
[940.18 --> 941.46]  or going through hard times.
[941.96 --> 943.84]  People needing community.
[944.54 --> 945.38]  And that struck me.
[945.38 --> 946.48]  And that was the whole point
[946.48 --> 947.86]  of the 20,000 phone calls.
[948.12 --> 949.08]  And it's the whole point
[949.08 --> 950.78]  of starting out at Hope Community Church.
[952.38 --> 955.22]  We spent 27 years in school gyms.
[956.68 --> 957.94]  In 1994,
[958.34 --> 960.64]  we purchased 7.5 acres of land.
[961.26 --> 962.92]  The land this church is on.
[963.02 --> 964.58]  The land that these townhouses are on.
[965.36 --> 969.12]  With a dream of being a hub in the community.
[969.12 --> 972.10]  Of being the center of the community.
[972.10 --> 975.10]  Look at this first slide.
[976.56 --> 977.48]  Hopefully it's up there.
[978.50 --> 979.68]  You can kind of see it there, right?
[979.92 --> 981.38]  That was the land we bought.
[982.72 --> 984.10]  At least a part of it.
[984.28 --> 984.92]  It was a mess.
[985.32 --> 986.18]  Look at the next slide.
[988.28 --> 989.46]  There's a group of us.
[989.96 --> 992.46]  There were so many projects involved with the land.
[992.60 --> 993.50]  Keeping it clean.
[994.12 --> 995.42]  Planting Christmas trees
[995.42 --> 998.00]  so we would have a tax break on the land
[998.00 --> 999.50]  and keep agricultural standing.
[999.50 --> 1004.16]  We had people renting that ugly house at some point.
[1004.92 --> 1006.44]  Anyway, all kinds of projects.
[1006.76 --> 1007.70]  Being the hub,
[1008.10 --> 1010.32]  becoming a hub of a city was hard work.
[1010.80 --> 1011.90]  And yet, here we are.
[1013.32 --> 1015.28]  In November 9, 2014,
[1015.48 --> 1016.90]  we celebrated groundbreaking.
[1017.36 --> 1019.26]  20 years after we bought the land.
[1019.64 --> 1022.76]  And I would have liked to have said to myself
[1022.76 --> 1023.92]  when we bought the land
[1023.92 --> 1025.50]  that it was going to be 20 years later.
[1025.58 --> 1026.46]  And I thought, 20?
[1026.46 --> 1029.56]  We were looking forward to like 5 maybe.
[1030.14 --> 1032.76]  But 20, and yet God had His own sense of timing.
[1033.68 --> 1034.78]  And we did a groundbreaking.
[1035.00 --> 1036.20]  Look at this next slide here.
[1037.40 --> 1040.58]  That was the invitation we sent out, right?
[1040.60 --> 1042.46]  An invitation to come to the groundbreaking
[1042.46 --> 1045.28]  Sunday, November 9, 2014 at noon.
[1045.76 --> 1049.72]  And here is a picture of the folks who came to there.
[1050.04 --> 1050.88]  And I remember saying,
[1050.96 --> 1051.68]  we had this ceremony,
[1051.84 --> 1053.60]  we had politicians and a bunch of our people.
[1053.60 --> 1057.12]  I remember saying that the church is not a building,
[1057.40 --> 1058.32]  but a people.
[1058.72 --> 1059.90]  And we do our part.
[1059.96 --> 1060.84]  And I thought it was significant
[1060.84 --> 1062.60]  because we stand there with shovels.
[1063.28 --> 1063.50]  Right?
[1063.58 --> 1064.48]  We do our part.
[1064.60 --> 1065.52]  We do our digging.
[1066.06 --> 1066.70]  But God,
[1066.80 --> 1068.42]  and then I pointed to this,
[1068.56 --> 1069.92]  on this next slide here,
[1070.78 --> 1073.22]  God is like the excavator.
[1074.12 --> 1075.32]  And He does the heavy lifting.
[1075.32 --> 1078.48]  And He's still doing the heavy lifting.
[1079.08 --> 1080.18]  And we trust that.
[1080.28 --> 1081.32]  But we do our part.
[1081.96 --> 1084.90]  And I thought that was important.
[1085.70 --> 1086.94]  And we did build, obviously.
[1087.68 --> 1091.16]  Here's a shot of us in the building.
[1091.48 --> 1093.62]  And you probably can't see it very easily,
[1093.78 --> 1096.36]  but we wrote on those plywood walls,
[1096.80 --> 1098.16]  belong, believe, become.
[1098.38 --> 1099.38]  You see it here too.
[1099.74 --> 1101.52]  Belong, believe, become.
[1102.14 --> 1103.70]  We were holding up the vision.
[1104.52 --> 1106.32]  And then we did something else
[1106.32 --> 1107.38]  in the next slide here.
[1107.94 --> 1109.36]  We wrote on the walls.
[1109.46 --> 1110.16]  I've said this before,
[1110.24 --> 1111.24]  but I think it's still profound.
[1111.32 --> 1112.08]  We wrote on the walls.
[1112.18 --> 1113.66]  This is Carolyn Gerber writing on the wall.
[1113.92 --> 1114.70]  I like what she wrote.
[1114.76 --> 1116.38]  The Spirit of the Lord has bound us together.
[1116.80 --> 1118.54]  And that's been so true.
[1118.88 --> 1121.36]  We are bound together by God's Spirit.
[1121.36 --> 1123.42]  And He continues to lead us
[1123.42 --> 1124.40]  to reach out to the community.
[1125.34 --> 1127.84]  These walls are literally covered
[1127.84 --> 1129.70]  with prayers and verses.
[1130.68 --> 1132.20]  And I think that's an awesome thing.
[1133.78 --> 1136.52]  You can see the vision of the church
[1136.52 --> 1139.64]  in our logos.
[1139.90 --> 1140.90]  If you go to the next slide.
[1140.90 --> 1145.78]  This was the first one that we had.
[1146.28 --> 1149.10]  You can see the cross and then homes.
[1149.70 --> 1151.98]  And this idea that the cross and the homes
[1151.98 --> 1154.98]  come together and the gospel penetrates real lives.
[1155.58 --> 1156.80]  We went on to this next one
[1156.80 --> 1158.26]  a number of years after that.
[1158.62 --> 1159.80]  Similar idea.
[1160.24 --> 1161.06]  We've got the belong, believe,
[1161.12 --> 1161.64]  to come in there.
[1161.72 --> 1163.42]  But there again, the cross and the home.
[1163.60 --> 1166.18]  You see the unity of those two in these things.
[1166.18 --> 1168.70]  The gospel meeting us in our homes,
[1168.82 --> 1169.52]  in our lives.
[1169.52 --> 1171.98]  And this is the one that we presently have now.
[1172.84 --> 1174.00]  And this is a beautiful,
[1174.28 --> 1175.64]  again, the cross is central.
[1176.06 --> 1177.68]  But this is the gospel coming
[1177.68 --> 1179.58]  at the intersections of life.
[1180.58 --> 1182.02]  This is into the community,
[1182.24 --> 1183.32]  into real people's lives,
[1183.66 --> 1186.82]  into the community that exists around us.
[1189.36 --> 1192.40]  Our founding pastor was Steve Eldington,
[1192.54 --> 1194.00]  his amazing wife Marie.
[1194.68 --> 1195.60]  Funny how that goes.
[1196.38 --> 1198.86]  Being a pastor requires an amazing wife.
[1199.52 --> 1201.64]  And these,
[1202.12 --> 1202.68]  these,
[1203.78 --> 1205.44]  I know I felt kind of guilty with all these.
[1205.64 --> 1206.38]  Some of you have been wondering,
[1206.48 --> 1207.78]  what's this mess all about?
[1209.42 --> 1212.16]  I felt guilty because Brittany was behind here.
[1212.82 --> 1213.74]  I just want to assure you,
[1213.74 --> 1214.48]  you probably heard the violin.
[1214.48 --> 1219.22]  But these are seven years plus worth of sermons.
[1220.30 --> 1222.66]  And we recorded them on cassettes.
[1222.76 --> 1223.42]  For young people,
[1223.52 --> 1224.48]  this is called a cassette.
[1225.60 --> 1227.60]  And you actually put it in a separate device
[1227.60 --> 1228.62]  called a tape recorder.
[1229.26 --> 1230.90]  There was no computer involved.
[1231.00 --> 1231.56]  I know, crazy.
[1231.96 --> 1232.36]  But anyways,
[1233.08 --> 1236.22]  seven plus years of sermons.
[1236.80 --> 1237.12]  Some of,
[1237.22 --> 1239.36]  a lot of Steve's and a lot of mine
[1239.36 --> 1240.54]  all mixed together there.
[1241.36 --> 1242.88]  The reason I put that there
[1242.88 --> 1248.06]  is because I think when we transition,
[1250.14 --> 1252.44]  the verse in Esther jumped out in my mind
[1252.44 --> 1253.16]  when Esther,
[1253.66 --> 1254.48]  God said to Esther,
[1254.56 --> 1256.12]  you were born for such a time as this.
[1256.50 --> 1257.86]  You get your moment.
[1259.58 --> 1259.76]  You know,
[1259.94 --> 1261.96]  this is some of my moments,
[1262.10 --> 1263.30]  some of Steve's moments.
[1263.92 --> 1265.52]  Moments to try to share
[1265.52 --> 1267.16]  the good news of the gospel
[1267.16 --> 1268.92]  to people that we love.
[1269.98 --> 1270.68]  It's your moment.
[1277.16 --> 1279.32]  Steve and Marie cast a vision
[1279.32 --> 1280.36]  of a church for the community.
[1281.06 --> 1282.06]  I was next in line.
[1282.06 --> 1284.16]  I received the baton from Steve.
[1285.60 --> 1287.06]  I think little did they know,
[1287.54 --> 1288.90]  and certainly Candy and I didn't know that,
[1288.96 --> 1290.74]  we'd be leading for the next 25 years.
[1292.04 --> 1293.04]  And still growing.
[1293.30 --> 1294.26]  That'll be this March.
[1294.26 --> 1295.88]  I threw on here,
[1295.98 --> 1296.70]  there's a slide of,
[1297.12 --> 1298.00]  you can see it just so,
[1298.12 --> 1298.72]  in case you're wondering,
[1298.82 --> 1299.34]  am I official?
[1299.72 --> 1302.34]  This is my classical certificate
[1302.34 --> 1303.50]  for evangelism.
[1303.78 --> 1306.36]  But you notice September 20th, 1996.
[1309.06 --> 1309.78]  25 years.
[1311.72 --> 1313.80]  I didn't want to have 25 years
[1313.80 --> 1315.44]  of cassette tapes on the stage here
[1315.44 --> 1316.48]  because there would be no room
[1316.48 --> 1318.66]  for anybody else.
[1318.80 --> 1319.80]  And thank goodness
[1319.80 --> 1321.04]  we've improved technology.
[1321.04 --> 1323.50]  For the last five years,
[1323.76 --> 1325.98]  I've had the joy
[1325.98 --> 1327.60]  of serving with Dave.
[1327.86 --> 1329.10]  A profound joy.
[1332.58 --> 1333.34]  Dave and Brittany,
[1334.34 --> 1335.86]  I'm going to speak for Candy too.
[1338.54 --> 1340.24]  You don't know what it means for us
[1340.24 --> 1343.44]  to pass the baton
[1343.44 --> 1345.28]  to people like you.
[1345.28 --> 1350.40]  It's,
[1350.64 --> 1353.68]  it feels so good
[1353.68 --> 1354.74]  knowing that the vision
[1354.74 --> 1355.88]  and the people
[1355.88 --> 1357.72]  are in good hands.
[1361.14 --> 1362.14]  I can't describe
[1362.14 --> 1362.98]  how good that feels.
[1364.88 --> 1366.26]  I want to speak some words
[1366.26 --> 1367.28]  to Dave and Brittany,
[1367.44 --> 1368.00]  but I know
[1368.00 --> 1369.32]  some of these words
[1369.32 --> 1370.88]  will speak to you as well.
[1372.16 --> 1373.34]  I'm going to share some words
[1373.34 --> 1374.50]  that have meant something to me.
[1374.88 --> 1375.42]  I'm going to borrow
[1375.42 --> 1376.56]  from the likes of Henry Nowen
[1376.56 --> 1377.22]  and a few others
[1377.22 --> 1378.56]  to share those words.
[1379.06 --> 1380.44]  This first set of words
[1380.44 --> 1381.76]  is going to be from Henry Nowen.
[1382.20 --> 1382.60]  And let me,
[1382.64 --> 1384.30]  let me read the quote to you.
[1384.88 --> 1385.68]  And then I'll have,
[1385.80 --> 1386.38]  some of the quotes
[1386.38 --> 1387.30]  are going to be up on a slide.
[1387.42 --> 1388.04]  But let me set up.
[1388.14 --> 1389.20]  Henry Nowen was in an interview.
[1389.66 --> 1391.88]  Henry Nowen's a great thinker,
[1392.22 --> 1392.90]  an amazing,
[1393.68 --> 1394.64]  was an amazing writer.
[1394.64 --> 1397.48]  And he had some amazing things
[1397.48 --> 1398.32]  to say for pastors.
[1398.82 --> 1399.54]  And he said this,
[1399.86 --> 1401.04]  I'm like many pastors.
[1401.04 --> 1402.36]  I commit myself
[1402.36 --> 1404.16]  to projects and plans
[1404.16 --> 1404.70]  and then I wonder
[1404.70 --> 1405.76]  how I can get them all done.
[1406.64 --> 1408.36]  This is true of the pastor,
[1408.50 --> 1408.96]  the teacher,
[1409.08 --> 1409.82]  the administrator.
[1410.20 --> 1410.44]  Indeed,
[1410.52 --> 1411.36]  it is true of our culture,
[1411.42 --> 1411.94]  but it tells us,
[1412.36 --> 1413.88]  do as much as you can
[1413.88 --> 1415.44]  or you'll never make it.
[1415.96 --> 1416.62]  And in that sense,
[1416.70 --> 1417.66]  pastors are part of the world.
[1417.74 --> 1418.44]  And I've discovered,
[1418.60 --> 1418.90]  says Nowen,
[1419.02 --> 1420.48]  I cannot fight the demons
[1420.48 --> 1422.52]  of busyness directly.
[1422.52 --> 1425.52]  I cannot continuously say no to this
[1425.52 --> 1427.28]  or no to that
[1427.28 --> 1430.00]  unless there's something
[1430.00 --> 1433.20]  ten times more attractive to choose.
[1433.66 --> 1434.86]  Saying no to my lust,
[1434.98 --> 1435.60]  my greed,
[1435.76 --> 1436.34]  my needs,
[1436.56 --> 1437.46]  the world's power
[1437.46 --> 1439.48]  takes an enormous amount of energy.
[1439.86 --> 1440.56]  And then this quote,
[1440.74 --> 1441.54]  and here it continues.
[1442.52 --> 1444.22]  The only hope
[1444.22 --> 1447.70]  is to find something
[1447.70 --> 1449.98]  so obviously real,
[1449.98 --> 1452.16]  so attractive that I can devote
[1452.16 --> 1454.00]  all my energies
[1454.00 --> 1455.64]  to saying yes.
[1457.34 --> 1459.24]  One such thing I can say yes to
[1459.24 --> 1460.32]  is when I come in touch
[1460.32 --> 1462.14]  with the fact that I am loved.
[1463.38 --> 1464.34]  And once I have found
[1464.34 --> 1465.76]  that in my total brokenness,
[1465.84 --> 1467.40]  I am still loved,
[1468.42 --> 1469.98]  I become free from the compulsion
[1470.50 --> 1473.10]  of doing successful things.
[1476.70 --> 1477.52]  Dave and Brittany,
[1477.52 --> 1480.94]  minister out of that love.
[1482.76 --> 1484.74]  Minister out of the profound knowledge
[1484.74 --> 1487.80]  that God loves you.
[1488.92 --> 1490.12]  Even at your worst.
[1491.68 --> 1492.40]  God loves you.
[1493.52 --> 1494.98]  And allow that to be your energy.
[1495.16 --> 1496.22]  Allow that to be your strength.
[1499.54 --> 1500.40]  Richard Foster,
[1500.52 --> 1502.36]  another amazing writer and pastor,
[1502.50 --> 1502.72]  said,
[1503.52 --> 1504.36]  you're going to be a minister
[1504.36 --> 1505.48]  of this church
[1505.48 --> 1506.50]  or a minister of Christ.
[1507.52 --> 1509.76]  I know it's kind of both,
[1509.90 --> 1511.34]  but I think he makes a good point.
[1511.80 --> 1511.94]  You know,
[1512.00 --> 1513.86]  you minister to the church,
[1513.96 --> 1516.08]  but you are a minister of Christ.
[1517.40 --> 1518.70]  And you aren't in this alone.
[1519.10 --> 1520.84]  Foster describes his first church
[1520.84 --> 1521.26]  and he said,
[1521.54 --> 1523.88]  it wasn't long before I realized,
[1523.96 --> 1524.32]  and there's no,
[1524.56 --> 1525.56]  it's not up on the screen here,
[1525.72 --> 1526.88]  but it wasn't long
[1526.88 --> 1527.46]  before I realized
[1527.46 --> 1528.66]  I needed help.
[1528.96 --> 1529.52]  This was Foster
[1529.52 --> 1530.20]  and his first church.
[1530.48 --> 1531.22]  I would love it
[1531.22 --> 1532.46]  if you would come to my office.
[1532.56 --> 1533.40]  He's talking to his church.
[1533.40 --> 1535.48]  Not just when you have a problem
[1535.48 --> 1537.10]  or when you are angry.
[1537.94 --> 1538.74]  Come anytime
[1538.74 --> 1540.80]  and give me a booster shot
[1540.80 --> 1541.98]  of prayer.
[1543.84 --> 1544.88]  People of Hope community,
[1545.04 --> 1545.74]  here's the challenge.
[1547.54 --> 1549.04]  I want you to think on that.
[1550.62 --> 1551.82]  I know you can come
[1551.82 --> 1552.80]  to the pastors,
[1553.18 --> 1553.90]  to the pastors,
[1554.08 --> 1554.72]  to the staff,
[1555.18 --> 1556.04]  and you can come
[1556.04 --> 1556.76]  with your problems,
[1556.84 --> 1557.54]  you can come with your struggles,
[1557.58 --> 1558.24]  and that's all good.
[1558.24 --> 1560.10]  But realize this,
[1560.60 --> 1561.58]  we, Dave,
[1561.70 --> 1563.34]  Dave needs your prayers.
[1563.46 --> 1564.60]  Brittany needs your prayers.
[1564.98 --> 1565.84]  Come to them
[1565.84 --> 1567.26]  to pray with them.
[1568.32 --> 1568.64]  I thought,
[1568.78 --> 1569.76]  what a beautiful thing
[1569.76 --> 1570.34]  that would do.
[1571.82 --> 1573.08]  My wife Candy and I,
[1573.38 --> 1574.60]  we've been so blessed
[1574.60 --> 1575.32]  with so many people
[1575.32 --> 1576.32]  coming alongside,
[1576.64 --> 1578.34]  so many praying for us
[1578.34 --> 1579.54]  and serving with us.
[1579.84 --> 1580.52]  And these people
[1580.52 --> 1581.38]  have loved us
[1581.38 --> 1582.10]  and still do,
[1582.36 --> 1583.30]  and we love them.
[1583.56 --> 1584.32]  And then together,
[1584.48 --> 1585.44]  together we served
[1585.44 --> 1586.16]  our loving Lord.
[1588.24 --> 1589.78]  Going back to Henry now,
[1589.88 --> 1591.76]  and he said it rather well.
[1591.84 --> 1592.94]  He said this about ministry.
[1593.64 --> 1594.82]  It spoke to me.
[1594.86 --> 1595.74]  I hope it speaks to you.
[1596.70 --> 1597.74]  Ministry means,
[1597.84 --> 1598.46]  and there's a slide
[1598.46 --> 1598.94]  for that one.
[1601.06 --> 1602.20]  Ministry means
[1602.20 --> 1606.14]  the ongoing attempt
[1606.14 --> 1609.16]  to put one's search
[1609.16 --> 1609.86]  for God
[1609.86 --> 1611.58]  with all its moments
[1611.58 --> 1612.36]  of pain,
[1612.98 --> 1613.38]  joy,
[1613.76 --> 1614.34]  despair,
[1614.34 --> 1615.34]  and hope
[1615.34 --> 1616.64]  at the disposal
[1616.64 --> 1617.44]  of those
[1617.44 --> 1618.68]  who want to join
[1618.68 --> 1619.46]  this search
[1619.46 --> 1621.26]  but don't know how.
[1627.74 --> 1629.04]  I've always tried
[1629.04 --> 1630.22]  to be completely authentic
[1630.22 --> 1630.82]  with people.
[1633.66 --> 1635.06]  I want them to see me
[1635.06 --> 1635.56]  not as,
[1635.88 --> 1636.58]  in some churches
[1636.58 --> 1637.62]  they call their pastor,
[1637.70 --> 1638.82]  not as Reverend Vanderwood.
[1639.46 --> 1639.94]  No.
[1640.86 --> 1641.88]  I really wanted them
[1641.88 --> 1642.30]  to see me
[1642.30 --> 1644.08]  as a fellow traveler.
[1644.08 --> 1647.18]  I'm fine with leading.
[1647.36 --> 1648.10]  I'm fine with leading.
[1649.74 --> 1652.12]  But I don't want
[1652.12 --> 1652.66]  to pretend
[1652.66 --> 1653.66]  and I never have
[1653.66 --> 1654.80]  that I have it all together
[1654.80 --> 1656.42]  because I don't.
[1657.70 --> 1659.12]  I just know Jesus does.
[1660.20 --> 1661.78]  And I know he loves us anyways.
[1663.44 --> 1664.58]  And I'm so glad,
[1664.64 --> 1665.42]  I'm so glad
[1665.42 --> 1666.10]  that you both
[1666.10 --> 1666.78]  are authentic
[1666.78 --> 1667.78]  and you're real.
[1667.86 --> 1668.30]  You heard that
[1668.30 --> 1669.12]  in some of the comments
[1669.12 --> 1670.10]  by some of those
[1670.10 --> 1671.00]  other pastors as well.
[1671.22 --> 1672.10]  You are authentic
[1672.10 --> 1672.60]  and real.
[1672.88 --> 1673.96]  You're not pretending.
[1674.48 --> 1676.08]  Never, never pretend.
[1676.42 --> 1677.44]  People don't need that.
[1680.80 --> 1681.74]  This made me think
[1681.74 --> 1682.72]  about leadership.
[1682.94 --> 1683.40]  Real leadership
[1683.40 --> 1684.48]  is about authenticity.
[1685.64 --> 1686.14]  I was reading
[1686.14 --> 1687.14]  a quote
[1687.14 --> 1687.90]  from a New Testament
[1687.90 --> 1688.52]  scholar named
[1688.52 --> 1689.92]  David Starling.
[1691.06 --> 1692.06]  And I think
[1692.06 --> 1692.68]  it's going to be up there.
[1693.34 --> 1694.10]  And he said,
[1694.36 --> 1694.88]  when you go
[1694.88 --> 1696.52]  looking in the Bible
[1696.52 --> 1698.20]  you realize pretty quickly
[1698.20 --> 1698.74]  that leadership
[1698.74 --> 1699.70]  can hardly be found
[1699.70 --> 1700.28]  there at all.
[1700.28 --> 1701.52]  The Bible certainly
[1701.52 --> 1702.20]  contains a host
[1702.20 --> 1703.16]  of concrete instances
[1703.16 --> 1704.00]  of individuals,
[1704.26 --> 1705.14]  tasks, offices,
[1705.30 --> 1705.66]  and images
[1705.66 --> 1708.08]  that you might want
[1708.08 --> 1708.88]  to connect in some
[1708.88 --> 1709.62]  with the category
[1709.62 --> 1711.00]  of leaders and leadership.
[1711.84 --> 1713.40]  Here's some of those images.
[1713.62 --> 1714.48]  Father, mother,
[1714.70 --> 1715.50]  shepherds, sages,
[1715.72 --> 1716.52]  prophets, judges,
[1716.74 --> 1717.44]  priests, king,
[1718.00 --> 1719.00]  messiah, apostle,
[1719.24 --> 1720.04]  pastors, elders,
[1720.24 --> 1720.68]  overseers.
[1721.06 --> 1722.32]  The instances are everywhere
[1722.32 --> 1723.48]  but the abstraction,
[1723.64 --> 1724.46]  the umbrella term
[1724.46 --> 1724.86]  leadership
[1724.86 --> 1726.02]  hardly rates a mention.
[1726.02 --> 1730.92]  I remember
[1730.92 --> 1733.14]  I had somebody
[1733.14 --> 1733.72]  in our church
[1733.72 --> 1734.86]  many years ago
[1734.86 --> 1736.58]  when I was first
[1736.58 --> 1737.02]  starting out
[1737.02 --> 1737.42]  trying to figure
[1737.42 --> 1738.10]  this thing out
[1738.10 --> 1739.40]  and I had someone
[1739.40 --> 1740.52]  come up to me
[1740.52 --> 1741.56]  who was in leadership
[1741.56 --> 1742.22]  at the time
[1742.22 --> 1743.90]  and they were pointing
[1743.90 --> 1744.56]  at me and they said
[1744.56 --> 1746.24]  everything rises
[1746.24 --> 1747.20]  and falls with leadership.
[1748.52 --> 1749.08]  And I go,
[1749.26 --> 1751.16]  really?
[1752.16 --> 1752.60]  Everything?
[1752.60 --> 1755.14]  There's no comfort
[1755.14 --> 1756.26]  in that at all.
[1757.02 --> 1757.86]  And then he said to me,
[1757.92 --> 1758.28]  he said,
[1758.64 --> 1758.80]  you know,
[1758.86 --> 1759.98]  Moses was a great leader.
[1760.32 --> 1761.50]  Sid, are you Moses?
[1763.08 --> 1763.74]  And I said,
[1763.98 --> 1764.42]  no,
[1765.20 --> 1766.36]  nor do I want to be.
[1768.66 --> 1769.60]  I had to be me.
[1771.02 --> 1772.10]  Maybe I wasn't the leader
[1772.10 --> 1773.00]  that he was looking for
[1773.00 --> 1773.94]  but I love that
[1773.94 --> 1774.68]  the apostle Paul
[1774.68 --> 1775.52]  uses metaphors
[1775.52 --> 1776.12]  for leadership
[1776.12 --> 1777.36]  that speak of relationships,
[1777.84 --> 1778.52]  of intimacy,
[1778.72 --> 1779.10]  of care,
[1779.22 --> 1779.72]  of faithfulness,
[1779.76 --> 1780.06]  of duty,
[1780.12 --> 1780.82]  of responsibility.
[1781.34 --> 1781.80]  Images like
[1781.80 --> 1782.64]  mother, father,
[1782.78 --> 1783.62]  steward, herald.
[1785.12 --> 1786.08]  And my favorite
[1786.08 --> 1786.74]  in many ways,
[1787.14 --> 1787.52]  pastor.
[1789.88 --> 1790.36]  Pastor,
[1790.46 --> 1791.16]  it really means
[1791.16 --> 1791.88]  herdsman.
[1794.22 --> 1795.14]  I see guys
[1795.14 --> 1796.28]  with dirty hands
[1796.28 --> 1799.34]  in the muck
[1799.34 --> 1800.72]  with everybody else.
[1801.62 --> 1802.02]  Shepherd.
[1802.94 --> 1803.38]  Jeremiah,
[1803.58 --> 1804.30]  in Jeremiah 3,
[1804.42 --> 1805.18]  God says it well.
[1805.64 --> 1806.22]  He says this
[1806.22 --> 1806.66]  about a shepherd.
[1807.10 --> 1807.44]  God says,
[1807.52 --> 1808.70]  then I will give you
[1808.70 --> 1809.48]  shepherds
[1809.48 --> 1810.68]  after my own heart
[1810.68 --> 1811.36]  and I know,
[1811.48 --> 1811.60]  Dave,
[1811.64 --> 1812.12]  you want to be
[1812.12 --> 1812.46]  a shepherd
[1812.46 --> 1813.26]  after God's own heart
[1813.26 --> 1813.82]  and so do I.
[1814.24 --> 1814.66]  Shepherds
[1814.66 --> 1815.60]  after my own heart
[1815.60 --> 1816.86]  who will lead you
[1816.86 --> 1817.38]  in way
[1817.38 --> 1818.34]  with knowledge
[1818.34 --> 1819.66]  and understanding
[1819.66 --> 1821.76]  and knowledge
[1821.76 --> 1822.22]  of the Bible
[1822.22 --> 1822.98]  and understanding
[1822.98 --> 1824.34]  of how life goes.
[1831.72 --> 1832.90]  Learning techniques
[1832.90 --> 1833.86]  and skills
[1833.86 --> 1835.50]  might make you
[1835.50 --> 1836.94]  a decent mechanical leader
[1836.94 --> 1839.04]  of a mechanical organization.
[1842.20 --> 1843.06]  But I think
[1843.06 --> 1844.64]  a true pastor
[1844.64 --> 1846.12]  leads with transparency
[1846.12 --> 1848.08]  and is one of the people
[1848.08 --> 1848.60]  on the journey
[1848.60 --> 1849.12]  with them.
[1851.40 --> 1852.02]  Shepherds are
[1852.02 --> 1853.28]  with their flocks.
[1854.76 --> 1855.66]  And the irony
[1855.66 --> 1856.68]  is also this
[1856.68 --> 1858.04]  because we get
[1858.04 --> 1859.46]  called shepherds
[1859.46 --> 1860.20]  and that's good
[1860.20 --> 1862.10]  but we are also sheep.
[1864.46 --> 1865.24]  Hebrews says it
[1865.24 --> 1865.68]  rather well
[1865.68 --> 1866.52]  on this blessing
[1866.52 --> 1868.22]  where the writer says,
[1868.48 --> 1869.56]  now may the God of peace
[1869.56 --> 1870.58]  who through the blood
[1870.58 --> 1871.82]  of the eternal covenant
[1871.82 --> 1873.44]  brought back from the dead
[1873.44 --> 1874.10]  our Lord Jesus
[1874.10 --> 1875.88]  that great shepherd
[1875.88 --> 1877.00]  of the sheep.
[1878.08 --> 1878.70]  Well, there I am.
[1878.98 --> 1880.30]  I'm a sheep here.
[1880.66 --> 1881.40]  That great shepherd
[1881.40 --> 1881.76]  of the sheep
[1881.76 --> 1882.64]  equip you
[1882.64 --> 1883.56]  with everything good
[1883.56 --> 1885.62]  for doing his will
[1885.62 --> 1887.28]  and may he work in us
[1887.28 --> 1888.52]  what is pleasing to him
[1888.52 --> 1889.86]  through Jesus Christ
[1889.86 --> 1890.60]  to whom the glory
[1890.60 --> 1891.24]  forever and ever.
[1891.54 --> 1891.92]  Amen.
[1892.30 --> 1892.44]  Right?
[1892.52 --> 1893.16]  And you see now
[1893.16 --> 1894.24]  you're a sheep.
[1901.12 --> 1901.92]  Not a slide
[1901.92 --> 1902.76]  so you don't have
[1902.76 --> 1903.40]  to look for one
[1903.40 --> 1904.64]  but Henry Nouwen
[1904.64 --> 1905.86]  he describes it this way
[1905.86 --> 1906.82]  and this is the guy
[1906.82 --> 1908.32]  wrote many, many
[1908.32 --> 1909.28]  he's passed away since
[1909.28 --> 1910.48]  but he wrote many, many books
[1910.48 --> 1912.42]  and was a professor
[1912.42 --> 1913.06]  at Yale
[1913.06 --> 1913.70]  and Harvard
[1913.70 --> 1915.84]  and he gave it all up
[1915.84 --> 1918.18]  and he worked with people
[1918.18 --> 1920.70]  who were handicapped.
[1922.72 --> 1923.32]  But he said this,
[1923.54 --> 1924.42]  more and more
[1924.42 --> 1926.16]  the desire grows in me
[1926.16 --> 1927.22]  simply to walk around
[1927.22 --> 1927.86]  greet people
[1927.86 --> 1928.78]  enter their homes
[1928.78 --> 1929.84]  sit on their doorsteps
[1929.84 --> 1930.62]  play ball
[1930.62 --> 1931.28]  throw water
[1931.28 --> 1932.34]  and be known as someone
[1932.34 --> 1933.88]  who wants to live with them.
[1934.62 --> 1935.80]  It is a privilege
[1935.80 --> 1936.76]  to have the time
[1936.76 --> 1937.52]  to practice
[1937.52 --> 1939.20]  this simple ministry
[1939.20 --> 1940.66]  of presence.
[1941.78 --> 1942.96]  Still it's not as simple
[1942.96 --> 1943.56]  as it seems.
[1943.56 --> 1945.58]  And he talks about his desires
[1945.58 --> 1946.20]  and I can relate
[1946.20 --> 1947.38]  and I think every leader can.
[1947.66 --> 1949.10]  My own desire to be useful
[1949.10 --> 1950.34]  to do something significant
[1950.34 --> 1951.08]  to be part of some
[1951.08 --> 1951.88]  impressive project
[1951.88 --> 1952.84]  is so strong
[1952.84 --> 1954.12]  that soon my time
[1954.12 --> 1954.76]  is taken up
[1954.76 --> 1956.46]  only by meetings
[1956.46 --> 1957.12]  and conferences
[1957.12 --> 1957.76]  and study groups
[1957.76 --> 1958.22]  and workshops
[1958.22 --> 1959.38]  and they prevent me
[1959.38 --> 1960.34]  from walking the streets.
[1961.94 --> 1963.06]  It's difficult
[1963.06 --> 1964.86]  not to have plans.
[1965.90 --> 1966.56]  I always push everybody
[1966.56 --> 1967.14]  to make plans
[1967.14 --> 1967.56]  it's difficult
[1967.56 --> 1968.38]  not to have them.
[1968.76 --> 1969.92]  Not to organize people
[1969.92 --> 1970.74]  around an urgent cause
[1970.74 --> 1971.56]  not to feel
[1971.56 --> 1972.14]  that you are working
[1972.14 --> 1972.80]  directly for social
[1972.80 --> 1973.70]  programs
[1973.70 --> 1974.48]  and he's not knocking
[1974.48 --> 1975.02]  those things folks
[1975.02 --> 1975.60]  so don't hear that.
[1975.90 --> 1977.00]  But I wonder more and more
[1977.00 --> 1977.96]  if the first
[1977.96 --> 1978.60]  here it is
[1978.60 --> 1979.66]  the first thing
[1979.66 --> 1980.66]  shouldn't be to know
[1980.66 --> 1981.56]  people by name
[1981.56 --> 1982.96]  to eat and drink with them
[1982.96 --> 1984.30]  to listen to their stories
[1984.30 --> 1985.26]  and tell your own
[1985.26 --> 1986.18]  and let them know
[1986.18 --> 1986.80]  with words
[1986.80 --> 1987.78]  and handshake
[1987.78 --> 1988.14]  and hugs
[1988.14 --> 1988.82]  remember those things
[1988.82 --> 1989.56]  handshake hugs
[1989.56 --> 1990.44]  those are the main things
[1990.44 --> 1992.00]  that you do not
[1992.00 --> 1993.02]  simply like them
[1993.02 --> 1994.80]  but you truly love them.
[1994.80 --> 2002.16]  people have taken note
[2002.16 --> 2002.96]  that I can get pretty
[2002.96 --> 2003.90]  worked up when I preach
[2003.90 --> 2007.68]  a number of people
[2007.68 --> 2008.16]  have come to me
[2008.16 --> 2008.50]  worried
[2008.50 --> 2009.64]  whether I'm going to
[2009.64 --> 2010.68]  survive on every
[2010.68 --> 2011.40]  given Sunday
[2011.40 --> 2015.30]  but here's why
[2015.30 --> 2019.10]  first this
[2019.10 --> 2021.90]  I love
[2021.90 --> 2022.98]  the gospel
[2022.98 --> 2023.62]  story
[2023.62 --> 2025.92]  I love it
[2025.92 --> 2029.70]  and I long
[2029.70 --> 2030.56]  for people
[2030.56 --> 2031.30]  to know it
[2031.30 --> 2033.70]  and to live it
[2033.70 --> 2035.70]  and to share it
[2035.70 --> 2037.36]  to let it
[2037.36 --> 2038.50]  liberate them
[2038.50 --> 2040.16]  because it has
[2040.16 --> 2041.18]  liberated me
[2041.18 --> 2043.62]  without the gospel
[2043.62 --> 2044.04]  story
[2044.04 --> 2045.32]  I'm just a slave
[2045.32 --> 2050.40]  here's the second thing
[2050.40 --> 2051.58]  why I get so passionate
[2051.58 --> 2053.48]  I love
[2053.48 --> 2055.34]  I love so many of you
[2055.34 --> 2056.90]  I'll say all of you
[2056.90 --> 2057.30]  but I don't know
[2057.30 --> 2058.14]  everybody who's online
[2058.14 --> 2061.60]  I love so many of you
[2061.60 --> 2063.36]  I know your stories
[2063.36 --> 2065.90]  and I want the gospel
[2065.90 --> 2067.22]  story to penetrate
[2067.22 --> 2068.86]  into your hearts
[2068.86 --> 2070.04]  and into your stories
[2070.04 --> 2071.44]  into your marriages
[2071.44 --> 2073.22]  into your children's lives
[2073.22 --> 2074.44]  into your depression
[2074.44 --> 2075.80]  into your anxieties
[2075.80 --> 2077.02]  into your addictions
[2077.02 --> 2078.18]  into your holidays
[2078.18 --> 2079.86]  into your friendships
[2079.86 --> 2081.00]  into your workplace
[2081.00 --> 2082.34]  I want the gospel
[2082.34 --> 2083.04]  to penetrate
[2083.04 --> 2084.38]  all those places
[2084.38 --> 2085.82]  because then you'll be
[2085.82 --> 2086.36]  liberated
[2086.36 --> 2087.72]  and then you can share
[2087.72 --> 2088.60]  that liberation
[2088.60 --> 2090.34]  with others
[2090.34 --> 2098.60]  Dave
[2098.60 --> 2099.68]  Brittany
[2099.68 --> 2102.34]  keep letting that
[2102.34 --> 2103.40]  gospel story
[2103.40 --> 2104.98]  penetrate into your very core
[2104.98 --> 2108.38]  again and again
[2108.38 --> 2109.06]  and again
[2109.06 --> 2111.44]  so that it shapes
[2111.44 --> 2112.28]  you
[2112.28 --> 2114.78]  and then out of
[2114.78 --> 2115.62]  that
[2115.62 --> 2116.82]  you serve
[2116.82 --> 2121.28]  just a little more
[2121.28 --> 2123.98]  opportunity to speak to you
[2123.98 --> 2127.12]  in all of this
[2127.12 --> 2129.76]  stay humble and gentle
[2129.76 --> 2132.98]  somehow
[2132.98 --> 2133.70]  this servant
[2133.70 --> 2134.54]  leadership thing
[2134.54 --> 2134.92]  is about
[2134.92 --> 2135.86]  staying humble
[2135.86 --> 2137.82]  and that's not
[2137.82 --> 2138.98]  always an easy thing
[2138.98 --> 2139.50]  and I found this
[2139.50 --> 2140.14]  beautiful quote
[2140.14 --> 2141.24]  I've read it many times
[2141.24 --> 2142.30]  to keep myself
[2142.30 --> 2142.96]  on track
[2142.96 --> 2144.66]  Tim Keller
[2144.66 --> 2145.20]  writes it
[2145.20 --> 2146.38]  it's a little long
[2146.38 --> 2147.48]  so I have it on a slide
[2147.48 --> 2147.86]  for you
[2147.86 --> 2149.70]  but just listen
[2149.70 --> 2151.00]  and let this sink in
[2151.00 --> 2152.22]  Tim Keller writes
[2152.22 --> 2154.18]  our natural condition
[2154.18 --> 2154.86]  under sin
[2154.86 --> 2156.18]  is to be glory empty
[2156.18 --> 2158.30]  isn't that interesting
[2158.30 --> 2159.22]  glory empty
[2159.22 --> 2161.44]  starved for significance
[2161.44 --> 2162.14]  honor
[2162.14 --> 2163.38]  and a sense of self worth
[2163.38 --> 2164.92]  sin makes us feel
[2164.92 --> 2166.20]  superior and overconfident
[2166.20 --> 2167.10]  because we are trying
[2167.10 --> 2167.88]  to prove ourselves
[2167.88 --> 2168.84]  and others
[2168.84 --> 2170.36]  that we are significant
[2170.36 --> 2172.06]  and inferior
[2172.06 --> 2172.86]  and underconfident
[2172.86 --> 2173.80]  because at a deep level
[2173.80 --> 2174.64]  we feel guilty
[2174.64 --> 2175.18]  and insecure
[2175.18 --> 2177.18]  some people's glory
[2177.18 --> 2177.60]  emptiness
[2177.60 --> 2178.42]  takes primarily
[2178.42 --> 2179.40]  the form of bravado
[2179.40 --> 2180.32]  and evident pride
[2180.32 --> 2181.04]  for others
[2181.04 --> 2181.78]  it takes the form
[2181.78 --> 2182.90]  of self depreciation
[2182.90 --> 2183.76]  and self loathing
[2183.76 --> 2185.78]  most of us
[2185.78 --> 2186.46]  are wracked
[2186.46 --> 2187.56]  by both impulses
[2187.56 --> 2189.88]  either way
[2189.88 --> 2191.26]  until the gospel
[2191.26 --> 2191.72]  here we go
[2191.72 --> 2192.70]  the gospel
[2192.70 --> 2193.76]  changes us
[2193.76 --> 2195.14]  we will
[2195.14 --> 2195.98]  use
[2195.98 --> 2196.58]  people
[2196.58 --> 2197.64]  in relationships
[2197.64 --> 2201.74]  we will work
[2201.74 --> 2202.24]  and relate
[2202.24 --> 2202.90]  to bolster
[2202.90 --> 2203.94]  our self image
[2203.94 --> 2204.74]  but when the gospel
[2204.74 --> 2205.32]  changes us
[2205.32 --> 2205.96]  we begin to relate
[2205.96 --> 2206.26]  to others
[2206.26 --> 2207.04]  for their sake
[2207.04 --> 2208.64]  it humbles us
[2208.64 --> 2209.96]  before anyone
[2209.96 --> 2211.72]  telling us
[2211.72 --> 2212.14]  we are sinners
[2212.14 --> 2213.20]  saved only by grace
[2213.20 --> 2215.80]  but it emboldens us
[2215.80 --> 2217.30]  before anyone
[2217.30 --> 2218.74]  telling us
[2218.74 --> 2219.42]  we are loved
[2219.42 --> 2219.92]  and honored
[2219.92 --> 2220.96]  by the only eyes
[2220.96 --> 2221.44]  in the universe
[2221.44 --> 2222.34]  that really count
[2222.34 --> 2223.82]  so we are free
[2223.82 --> 2225.18]  to enjoy people
[2225.18 --> 2226.28]  for who they are
[2226.28 --> 2227.42]  in themselves
[2227.42 --> 2229.16]  not for how they
[2229.16 --> 2230.08]  make us feel
[2230.08 --> 2231.64]  about ourselves
[2231.64 --> 2235.66]  we do not earn
[2235.66 --> 2236.12]  our worth
[2236.12 --> 2237.14]  through approval
[2237.14 --> 2238.32]  from people
[2238.32 --> 2239.48]  or through power
[2239.48 --> 2240.34]  over people
[2240.34 --> 2241.44]  the gospel
[2241.44 --> 2241.92]  makes us
[2241.92 --> 2242.70]  neither self
[2242.70 --> 2243.16]  confident
[2243.16 --> 2243.68]  nor self
[2243.68 --> 2244.24]  disdaining
[2244.24 --> 2245.26]  but gives us
[2245.26 --> 2245.80]  boldness
[2245.80 --> 2247.10]  and humility
[2247.10 --> 2248.44]  that can increase
[2248.44 --> 2249.26]  together
[2249.26 --> 2254.42]  I as a pastor
[2254.42 --> 2256.86]  had to battle
[2256.86 --> 2258.06]  pleasing people
[2258.06 --> 2259.46]  for a lot of years
[2259.46 --> 2261.88]  still do sometimes
[2261.88 --> 2265.08]  it took its toll
[2265.08 --> 2265.46]  on me
[2265.46 --> 2266.54]  in a lot of ways
[2266.54 --> 2268.88]  I want to keep
[2268.88 --> 2269.46]  it really simple
[2269.46 --> 2269.90]  here Dave
[2269.90 --> 2271.82]  just love the Lord
[2271.82 --> 2274.00]  and then just love
[2274.00 --> 2274.46]  his people
[2274.46 --> 2276.96]  and then tell them
[2276.96 --> 2277.42]  the truth
[2277.42 --> 2279.08]  with gentleness
[2279.08 --> 2280.48]  with humility
[2280.48 --> 2282.14]  with boldness
[2282.14 --> 2285.06]  the gospel
[2285.06 --> 2287.16]  creates true community
[2287.16 --> 2288.20]  through the spirit's power
[2288.20 --> 2290.78]  that's how it happens
[2290.78 --> 2293.08]  the gospel
[2293.08 --> 2293.92]  and the spirit
[2293.92 --> 2294.70]  keeps our egos
[2294.70 --> 2295.30]  out of the way
[2295.30 --> 2297.42]  Paul writes
[2297.42 --> 2298.34]  in Galatians 5
[2298.34 --> 2299.88]  he says it
[2299.88 --> 2300.72]  very succinctly
[2300.72 --> 2302.38]  serve one another
[2302.38 --> 2303.08]  humbly
[2303.08 --> 2303.66]  in love
[2303.66 --> 2307.02]  simple statement
[2307.02 --> 2309.48]  but sometimes
[2309.48 --> 2310.20]  hard to do
[2310.20 --> 2310.80]  and then he writes
[2310.80 --> 2312.38]  for the entire law
[2312.38 --> 2312.92]  I love this
[2312.92 --> 2313.98]  the entire law
[2313.98 --> 2314.54]  is fulfilled
[2314.54 --> 2315.40]  in keeping this
[2315.40 --> 2316.10]  one commandment
[2316.10 --> 2316.88]  love your neighbors
[2316.88 --> 2317.32]  yourself
[2317.32 --> 2319.40]  now if you don't
[2319.40 --> 2320.34]  here's how it's described
[2320.34 --> 2321.26]  if you bite
[2321.26 --> 2322.32]  and devour each other
[2322.32 --> 2323.08]  watch out
[2323.08 --> 2324.02]  or you will be destroyed
[2324.02 --> 2324.90]  by each other
[2324.90 --> 2326.48]  so I say
[2326.48 --> 2327.42]  walk by the spirit
[2327.42 --> 2329.30]  and sadly
[2329.30 --> 2330.00]  we see
[2330.00 --> 2332.46]  we see in a lot
[2332.46 --> 2333.00]  of places
[2333.00 --> 2333.80]  in the world today
[2333.80 --> 2334.80]  churches included
[2334.80 --> 2336.32]  a lot of biting
[2336.32 --> 2337.02]  and devouring
[2337.02 --> 2337.84]  of one another
[2337.84 --> 2340.68]  when we continually
[2340.68 --> 2341.42]  remind ourselves
[2341.42 --> 2342.36]  who we are
[2342.36 --> 2343.12]  in Christ
[2343.12 --> 2344.44]  it frees us up
[2344.44 --> 2345.46]  to love one another
[2345.46 --> 2346.64]  and to build unity
[2346.64 --> 2347.40]  in community
[2347.40 --> 2349.98]  one of my
[2349.98 --> 2350.84]  favorite prayers
[2350.84 --> 2351.28]  of Jesus
[2351.28 --> 2352.28]  is when he prayed
[2352.28 --> 2354.00]  may they
[2354.00 --> 2354.90]  be one
[2354.90 --> 2355.30]  father
[2355.30 --> 2356.20]  as you and I
[2356.20 --> 2356.96]  are one
[2356.96 --> 2359.22]  if you really
[2359.22 --> 2359.88]  spend some time
[2359.88 --> 2360.66]  thinking on that
[2360.66 --> 2363.10]  we are invited
[2363.10 --> 2363.76]  into the
[2363.76 --> 2364.50]  oneness
[2364.50 --> 2365.60]  of the trinity
[2365.60 --> 2367.82]  that
[2367.82 --> 2369.26]  blows me away
[2369.26 --> 2376.34]  that's so much
[2376.34 --> 2376.84]  more than just
[2376.84 --> 2377.32]  putting up
[2377.32 --> 2377.88]  with each other
[2377.88 --> 2381.66]  let me conclude
[2381.66 --> 2382.20]  with one more
[2382.20 --> 2382.88]  verse before we
[2382.88 --> 2383.30]  go into the
[2383.30 --> 2384.50]  commissioning
[2384.50 --> 2385.96]  Romans 8 28
[2385.96 --> 2386.68]  out of the voice
[2386.68 --> 2387.56]  I love how it
[2387.56 --> 2388.06]  says here
[2388.06 --> 2388.68]  it says
[2388.68 --> 2390.56]  we are confident
[2390.56 --> 2392.06]  that God
[2392.06 --> 2392.92]  there we go
[2392.92 --> 2394.28]  we are confident
[2394.28 --> 2394.80]  that God
[2394.80 --> 2395.62]  is able to
[2395.62 --> 2396.54]  orchestrate
[2396.54 --> 2397.32]  everything
[2397.32 --> 2398.76]  I can stop right
[2398.76 --> 2399.14]  there and say
[2399.14 --> 2399.88]  so Dave relax
[2399.88 --> 2401.78]  we are confident
[2401.78 --> 2402.52]  that God
[2402.52 --> 2403.44]  can orchestrate
[2403.44 --> 2404.02]  everything
[2404.02 --> 2405.22]  to work towards
[2405.22 --> 2405.98]  something good
[2405.98 --> 2406.54]  and beautiful
[2406.54 --> 2407.32]  when
[2407.32 --> 2408.22]  what do we do
[2408.22 --> 2409.54]  we love him
[2409.54 --> 2411.10]  and accept his
[2411.10 --> 2411.94]  invitation to live
[2411.94 --> 2412.60]  according to his
[2412.60 --> 2412.90]  plan
[2412.90 --> 2414.12]  there it is
[2414.12 --> 2414.74]  in a nutshell
[2414.74 --> 2418.58]  remember who's
[2418.58 --> 2419.70]  orchestrating it all
[2419.70 --> 2421.98]  and it's not you
[2421.98 --> 2426.06]  I'm always grateful
[2426.06 --> 2426.58]  Dave and I have
[2426.58 --> 2427.38]  talked so many times
[2427.38 --> 2428.02]  I'm always grateful
[2428.02 --> 2428.42]  for him to
[2428.42 --> 2429.44]  when he talks about
[2429.44 --> 2430.16]  being here for the
[2430.16 --> 2430.64]  long haul
[2430.64 --> 2432.14]  I really think
[2432.14 --> 2432.86]  that builds community
[2432.86 --> 2435.24]  and I pray
[2435.24 --> 2436.22]  that you will
[2436.22 --> 2437.22]  work joyfully
[2437.22 --> 2437.88]  with God
[2437.88 --> 2438.92]  and his people
[2438.92 --> 2439.68]  in the time
[2439.68 --> 2441.00]  you've been given
[2441.00 --> 2445.06]  you hear this
[2445.06 --> 2445.48]  all the time
[2445.48 --> 2446.00]  you know
[2446.00 --> 2447.76]  when parents
[2447.76 --> 2449.36]  hear say
[2449.36 --> 2450.32]  to younger parents
[2450.32 --> 2451.32]  oh you know
[2451.32 --> 2451.72]  and especially
[2451.72 --> 2452.12]  when the younger
[2452.12 --> 2452.64]  parents start
[2452.64 --> 2453.16]  complaining about
[2453.16 --> 2454.10]  how busy it is
[2454.10 --> 2454.74]  with the little ones
[2454.74 --> 2455.52]  and they're losing
[2455.52 --> 2456.02]  their minds
[2456.02 --> 2456.84]  and say oh
[2456.84 --> 2457.66]  enjoy it
[2457.66 --> 2459.44]  it goes so fast
[2459.44 --> 2462.92]  I sort of describe
[2462.92 --> 2463.46]  myself as the
[2463.46 --> 2464.06]  grandpa of this
[2464.06 --> 2464.42]  church
[2464.42 --> 2467.46]  and as a grandpa
[2467.46 --> 2468.14]  talking to
[2468.14 --> 2469.74]  the young shepherd
[2469.74 --> 2471.16]  I sometimes call him
[2471.16 --> 2471.98]  young Skywalker
[2471.98 --> 2477.06]  I said this goes
[2477.06 --> 2477.74]  so fast
[2477.74 --> 2480.68]  so fast
[2480.68 --> 2483.16]  and then
[2483.16 --> 2485.22]  like Pastor Steve
[2485.22 --> 2486.32]  handed me this
[2486.32 --> 2486.94]  baton
[2486.94 --> 2488.48]  and then I ran
[2488.48 --> 2490.58]  Steve ran
[2490.58 --> 2491.60]  in this church
[2491.60 --> 2492.16]  for seven years
[2492.16 --> 2493.34]  he continued to run
[2493.34 --> 2494.46]  very well in other
[2494.46 --> 2495.36]  places but just for
[2495.36 --> 2496.52]  hope he was running
[2496.52 --> 2497.54]  for seven years
[2497.54 --> 2498.48]  and he handed it
[2498.48 --> 2498.96]  off to me
[2498.96 --> 2499.46]  and I ran
[2499.46 --> 2501.36]  well almost 25
[2501.36 --> 2501.90]  years now
[2501.90 --> 2505.16]  I picture
[2505.16 --> 2506.02]  I want you to
[2506.02 --> 2506.96]  picture this as well
[2506.96 --> 2509.04]  picture this sense
[2509.04 --> 2509.74]  of being part of
[2509.74 --> 2510.78]  God's grand story
[2510.78 --> 2511.88]  and picture down
[2511.88 --> 2512.40]  the road that
[2512.40 --> 2512.86]  you're going to
[2512.86 --> 2513.66]  hand the baton
[2513.66 --> 2515.62]  to somebody else
[2515.62 --> 2520.40]  because the story
[2520.40 --> 2521.34]  carries on
[2521.34 --> 2523.42]  the vision of God
[2523.42 --> 2524.16]  carries on
[2524.16 --> 2525.90]  and we get to
[2525.90 --> 2526.28]  serve
[2526.28 --> 2527.68]  for a time
[2527.68 --> 2533.78]  we're going to
[2533.78 --> 2534.78]  move into the
[2534.78 --> 2536.04]  commissioning now
[2536.04 --> 2538.54]  when Dave
[2538.54 --> 2539.18]  was
[2539.18 --> 2541.14]  commissioned as
[2541.14 --> 2541.66]  an associate
[2541.66 --> 2542.14]  pastor
[2542.14 --> 2543.62]  I gave him a
[2543.62 --> 2544.36]  towel at the time
[2544.36 --> 2546.18]  signifying servanthood
[2546.18 --> 2546.74]  and leadership
[2546.74 --> 2548.42]  the washing of feet
[2548.42 --> 2550.26]  basically say
[2550.26 --> 2550.54]  hey
[2550.54 --> 2551.64]  leaders serve
[2551.64 --> 2558.04]  this is a
[2558.04 --> 2559.32]  shepherd's crook
[2559.32 --> 2562.22]  my grandson
[2562.22 --> 2563.18]  said I could use it
[2563.18 --> 2564.32]  I thought it was a bit
[2564.32 --> 2564.98]  of a cheap shot
[2564.98 --> 2565.62]  but anyways
[2565.62 --> 2568.26]  my shepherd's crook
[2568.26 --> 2569.30]  you say
[2569.30 --> 2570.10]  well what's it
[2570.10 --> 2571.10]  really for
[2571.10 --> 2572.76]  well
[2572.76 --> 2574.20]  a couple things
[2574.20 --> 2575.82]  shepherd's crook
[2575.82 --> 2576.46]  was used by the
[2576.46 --> 2576.74]  shepherd
[2576.74 --> 2578.48]  to keep the
[2578.48 --> 2579.36]  sheep together
[2579.36 --> 2581.78]  so build
[2581.78 --> 2582.24]  community
[2582.24 --> 2584.70]  it was also
[2584.70 --> 2585.14]  used
[2585.14 --> 2586.32]  you could hook
[2586.32 --> 2587.20]  a lamb out
[2587.20 --> 2587.54]  of the
[2587.54 --> 2588.56]  flock
[2588.56 --> 2590.10]  and check
[2590.10 --> 2590.80]  the lamb over
[2590.80 --> 2591.68]  without touching it
[2591.68 --> 2592.16]  because at first
[2592.16 --> 2592.76]  you shouldn't touch
[2592.76 --> 2592.96]  them
[2592.96 --> 2593.74]  and you hook
[2593.74 --> 2594.14]  the lamb
[2594.14 --> 2594.70]  and you look at
[2594.70 --> 2595.04]  it and make sure
[2595.04 --> 2595.76]  everything is okay
[2595.76 --> 2596.86]  and there I pictured
[2596.86 --> 2598.10]  let this represent
[2598.10 --> 2598.86]  for you
[2598.86 --> 2600.06]  pastoral care
[2600.06 --> 2602.36]  you're going to
[2602.36 --> 2603.28]  take care of the
[2603.28 --> 2604.10]  old and the young
[2604.10 --> 2604.62]  and everybody in
[2604.62 --> 2604.92]  between
[2604.92 --> 2607.56]  and you and I
[2607.56 --> 2608.04]  know this
[2608.04 --> 2609.42]  sometimes sheep
[2609.42 --> 2610.16]  wander
[2610.16 --> 2612.64]  and you need to
[2612.64 --> 2613.66]  nudge them back
[2613.66 --> 2614.42]  toward the flock
[2614.42 --> 2615.52]  maybe
[2615.52 --> 2616.56]  once on one of
[2616.56 --> 2616.84]  these
[2616.84 --> 2619.46]  but you nudge
[2619.46 --> 2620.02]  them toward the
[2620.02 --> 2620.26]  flock
[2620.26 --> 2621.16]  you nudge them
[2621.16 --> 2622.60]  back toward life
[2622.60 --> 2623.96]  back toward life
[2623.96 --> 2625.90]  and last
[2625.90 --> 2627.42]  and this is
[2627.42 --> 2629.12]  really more for
[2629.12 --> 2629.46]  Val
[2629.46 --> 2632.26]  if Dave is
[2632.26 --> 2632.80]  preaching too
[2632.80 --> 2633.08]  long
[2633.08 --> 2635.12]  you got it
[2635.12 --> 2637.86]  and then one
[2637.86 --> 2638.28]  more thing
[2638.28 --> 2639.88]  let this remind
[2639.88 --> 2640.36]  you also
[2640.36 --> 2642.18]  you're sheep
[2642.18 --> 2644.76]  you're human
[2644.76 --> 2646.62]  live with your
[2646.62 --> 2646.98]  limits
[2646.98 --> 2650.62]  I'd like to invite
[2650.62 --> 2651.12]  Dave and Brittany
[2651.12 --> 2651.80]  to come up here
[2651.80 --> 2657.18]  try to make sure
[2657.18 --> 2657.74]  we stay in
[2657.74 --> 2658.62]  in the camera
[2658.62 --> 2659.60]  here
[2659.60 --> 2660.82]  can't remember
[2660.82 --> 2661.38]  exactly where the
[2661.38 --> 2661.76]  line was
[2661.76 --> 2662.24]  we better get
[2662.24 --> 2662.62]  a little bit
[2662.62 --> 2663.00]  closer
[2663.00 --> 2665.30]  yeah
[2665.30 --> 2666.14]  getting signals
[2666.14 --> 2666.82]  to move over
[2666.82 --> 2670.68]  all right

[2676.04 --> 2678.56]  let me ask you
[2678.56 --> 2679.16]  this question
[2679.16 --> 2681.76]  do you believe
[2681.76 --> 2682.42]  in
[2682.42 --> 2684.58]  and accept
[2684.58 --> 2685.38]  that God
[2685.38 --> 2686.26]  in his

[2690.38 --> 2696.82]  then let me
[2696.82 --> 2697.28]  give you some
[2697.28 --> 2698.22]  challenges and
[2698.22 --> 2699.02]  charges that are
[2699.02 --> 2699.66]  going to go with

[3263.14 --> 3263.76]  lonely job
[3263.76 --> 3264.30]  sometimes
[3264.30 --> 3265.80]  but we have

[3278.08 --> 3278.70]  faithful
[3278.70 --> 3279.72]  godly leadership
[3279.72 --> 3281.18]  for a very long
[3281.18 --> 3281.54]  time
[3281.54 --> 3282.24]  and i've learned
[3282.24 --> 3283.04]  a lot in five
[3283.04 --> 3283.38]  years
[3283.38 --> 3284.34]  and i'm going
[3284.34 --> 3284.84]  to learn a lot
[3284.84 --> 3285.52]  more still
[3285.52 --> 3286.20]  even as you
[3286.20 --> 3286.70]  return
[3286.70 --> 3287.64]  after your sabbatical
[3287.64 --> 3289.14]  i have a lot
[3289.14 --> 3289.82]  i could say to you
[3289.82 --> 3290.26]  but i'll save
[3290.26 --> 3290.98]  some of my words
[3290.98 --> 3291.80]  for march 7

[3295.82 --> 3297.94]  but i'm very grateful
[3297.94 --> 3299.60]  i also think
[3299.60 --> 3300.32]  of the advice
[3300.32 --> 3301.14]  that some pastors
[3301.14 --> 3302.26]  give or receive
[3302.26 --> 3302.78]  and that is
[3302.78 --> 3303.18]  to not have
[3303.18 --> 3303.76]  too many friends
[3303.76 --> 3304.42]  in their church
[3304.42 --> 3305.56]  because when they
[3305.56 --> 3306.32]  leave it's hard
[3306.32 --> 3307.82]  we haven't heeded
[3307.82 --> 3308.44]  that advice
[3308.44 --> 3309.00]  very well
[3309.00 --> 3310.34]  we have lots
[3310.34 --> 3310.74]  of friends
[3310.74 --> 3311.10]  that hope
[3311.10 --> 3311.54]  and we're very
[3311.54 --> 3312.46]  grateful for them
[3312.46 --> 3312.90]  and i know
[3312.90 --> 3313.60]  you're probably
[3313.60 --> 3314.32]  joining us this
[3314.32 --> 3314.58]  morning
[3314.58 --> 3315.76]  and we're so
[3315.76 --> 3316.62]  grateful for you
[3316.62 --> 3318.08]  and we're excited
[3318.08 --> 3318.88]  to serve
[3318.88 --> 3319.86]  and grow
[3319.86 --> 3320.48]  as disciples
[3320.48 --> 3321.00]  with you
[3321.00 --> 3321.80]  to raise our
[3321.80 --> 3322.20]  kids
[3322.20 --> 3323.10]  and the next
[3323.10 --> 3323.56]  generation
[3323.56 --> 3324.98]  of our children
[3324.98 --> 3326.64]  to follow christ
[3326.64 --> 3328.08]  and we're excited
[3328.08 --> 3329.18]  to serve the city
[3329.18 --> 3330.28]  and to be a blessing
[3330.28 --> 3330.88]  in this city
[3330.88 --> 3331.82]  as god's hands
[3331.82 --> 3332.30]  and feet
[3332.30 --> 3333.42]  for we hope
[3333.42 --> 3333.74]  and pray
[3333.74 --> 3334.58]  many many many
[3334.58 --> 3335.44]  years to come
[3335.44 --> 3337.44]  and our prayer
[3337.44 --> 3338.14]  i know i speak
[3338.14 --> 3338.70]  on bivor britney
[3338.70 --> 3339.14]  too here
[3339.14 --> 3339.92]  is that many people
[3339.92 --> 3340.54]  come to faith
[3340.54 --> 3341.10]  in our church
[3341.10 --> 3342.78]  that this city
[3342.78 --> 3343.56]  would hear the good
[3343.56 --> 3344.62]  news through our church
[3344.62 --> 3346.20]  and that's an exciting
[3346.20 --> 3346.82]  vision for us
[3346.82 --> 3347.48]  going forward
[3347.48 --> 3349.98]  i could say a lot more
[3349.98 --> 3350.86]  but a lot of words
[3350.86 --> 3351.64]  have already been shared
[3351.64 --> 3352.56]  and you've heard my voice
[3352.56 --> 3353.26]  lots already
[3353.26 --> 3355.10]  but i do want to stop
[3355.10 --> 3356.28]  talking and start doing
[3356.28 --> 3357.98]  and i'm cognizant
[3357.98 --> 3358.74]  of the fact that when i
[3358.74 --> 3359.24]  came to hope
[3359.24 --> 3360.24]  you talked about the towel
[3360.24 --> 3361.96]  and i'd like to start
[3361.96 --> 3363.30]  my first act
[3363.30 --> 3364.08]  as lead pastor

[3365.72 --> 3366.26]  from jesus
[3366.26 --> 3367.56]  and the gospel of john
[3367.56 --> 3368.72]  and if it's okay
[3368.72 --> 3369.26]  with you sid

[3373.12 --> 3373.58]  and if you want to
[3373.58 --> 3374.04]  take a seat
[3374.04 --> 3374.64]  we'll do that
[3396.26 --> 3426.24]  and if you want to
[3426.26 --> 3456.24]  and if you want to
[3456.26 --> 3486.24]  and if you want to
[3486.26 --> 3496.62]  i'm going to finish
[3496.62 --> 3497.72]  our service by doing
[3497.72 --> 3498.34]  one of the things
[3498.34 --> 3499.48]  that we both love
[3499.48 --> 3500.48]  about being pastors
[3500.48 --> 3502.30]  and that is to give you
[3502.30 --> 3503.00]  god's blessing
[3503.00 --> 3503.92]  and so if you're in your
[3503.92 --> 3504.34]  homes

[3510.58 --> 3511.32]  well-known blessings
[3511.32 --> 3512.12]  in the bible
[3512.12 --> 3513.28]  and then we will sing
