[125.00 → 127.00] I love you.
[127.00 → 130.48] day and if I catch a fish that's fine if not my daughters will probably lose a
[130.48 → 135.04] hook and that'll be fine as well but as we come to today not everyone
[135.04 → 139.84] experiences this day in a real positive way in fact some of us who've lost dads
[139.84 → 143.38] this is a day of grief where grief kind of comes back up in our hearts for
[143.38 → 147.16] others maybe we didn't have a dad or maybe our dad was abusive or absent
[147.16 → 151.18] or abandoned us and this is a day when it's hard for us to connect and relate
[151.18 → 155.20] to God especially when we sing things like good father it's who you are
[155.20 → 158.62] you're perfect in all your ways, yet we have an image of a father here that's
[158.62 → 163.12] imperfect let me just share with you this as we start this message today that God
[163.12 → 167.80] has given us the picture of the Heavenly Father by which we are to use as the
[167.80 → 171.40] lens and filter for all of our relationships here not the other way
[171.40 → 174.72] and tendency is that when we've had a bad experience with our father we put
[174.72 → 178.66] that on God, and he doesn't want that, so I want to pause and this is a church
[178.66 → 181.66] of prayer because you guys are praying all the time I want to pray for those
[181.66 → 187.66] people who this day it's loss it's grief it's pain it's the unknown because
[187.66 → 190.78] they didn't have a dad I'd like to pray for those people right now, and I'm going
[190.78 → 195.22] to encourage you this if is you or you know someone who's experienced that type
[195.22 → 198.22] of thing and experiencing today would you just put your hand on your heart we
[198.22 → 201.40] just want to pray for healing over those hearts today could be you could be a
[201.40 → 205.90] friend of yours or a family member father as we come today we acknowledge you
[205.90 → 209.86] the good father, but we also acknowledge that there's pain and grief
[209.86 → 213.80] associated with this day whether it's through loss or absentee fathers or even
[213.80 → 220.10] abusive fathers Lord we ask that you minister your love your peace and your
[220.10 → 228.04] healing to every heart and every mind in Jesus name we pray amen now we are
[228.04 → 231.80] no stranger to challenges in these last 15 months right we've dealt lots of
[231.80 → 235.56] challenges with COVID anyone give an amen to that it's been tough lots of
[235.56 → 239.50] changes happening you know masks no masks churches open churches closed
[239.50 → 243.66] restaurants open restaurants closed but I've noticed something in the last
[243.66 → 247.44] weeks, and maybe you've noticed this is that there's a bit of renewed hope that's
[247.44 → 251.98] coming now I enjoyed going to patios at restaurants, but that limited my
[251.98 → 255.48] choices and I do like to go out, and you know eat and things like this and my wife
[255.48 → 258.96] and I went and celebrated an anniversary last night we said to the servers we're
[258.96 → 262.98] coming in we haven't been here in years don't of course we haven't been really
[262.98 → 266.88] anywhere to any restaurants in years, but there's this renewed hope and in fact I
[266.88 → 273.32] was out for a belated birthday supper about two weeks ago and as was that one
[273.32 → 277.14] of the restaurants these people were walking in, and you could tell they
[277.14 → 279.48] hadn't been in for a long time, and they hadn't seen friends in fact when they
[279.48 → 284.16] walked in they said this they're like you know they're just excited which is a
[284.16 → 288.46] bit of the tone we're getting as the church is coming back right it's good to see
[288.46 → 292.78] faces and for us as pastors this is kind of strange this isn't normal seeing
[292.78 → 295.84] you so when I call for an amen I really want it because it's been like seven
[295.84 → 298.90] months we didn't hear an amen at all everyone was just like we can't say
[298.90 → 302.08] anything and there's no one online, but there's renewed hopes and there are things
[302.08 → 304.58] we're looking forward to now I don't know if you're like me, I'm gonna talk to
[304.58 → 309.08] the guys for a second is anyone looking forward to going to a football game one
[309.08 → 313.90] day come on okay or a sporting event come on it's okay all right okay I'm a CFL fan I
[313.90 → 318.04] grew up in Saskatchewan any Saskatchewan people here come on yeah carry my one
[318.04 → 322.40] right there yes I'm a writers fan I love it I've already circled on the calendar
[322.40 → 326.56] when the writers are going to make fun of the Lions by trouncing them I want to be
[326.56 → 332.06] at that game okay I want to be there no I'm like a closet Lions fan okay, but I'm
[332.06 → 337.36] also looking forward to maybe in the grace of God that border will open up
[337.36 → 343.96] and I can go down to Seattle and I can watch a baseball game, or I go to Portland
[343.96 → 347.62] maybe in the fall like what's a basketball game, or you go to a Seahawks
[347.62 → 353.62] game whoa that would be amazing and what I'm what I was recalling today as we get
[353.62 → 357.22] into this message which is called the father's heart one of the most
[357.22 → 360.60] interesting things that ever happened in the history of NFL you might know a man
[360.60 → 364.90] named Stevie Johnson and if you don't know him Stevie Johnson was a receiver and
[364.90 → 369.94] this is about ten years ago now he was in a game and it was you know
[369.94 → 373.18] one of those kind of crucial games, and he's playing for the Bills and at the
[373.18 → 378.28] very end of the game he dropped a pass in the end zone and and and after that
[378.28 → 382.66] there's kind of like it was a big thing for him so as most people do when there's a
[382.66 → 386.52] big thing that happens in life you go to Twitter right that's what we do so he
[386.52 → 391.66] goes to Twitter and here's what Stevie Johnson says in November 2010 I praise you
[391.66 → 401.20] 24 7 meaning God and this is how you do me you expect me to learn from this how I
[401.20 → 410.54] will never forget this we're talking about the father's heart today Stevie
[410.54 → 418.24] Johnson expected a God whom he praises 24 7 today to make him catch that important
[418.24 → 424.20] touchdown pass you know who God was to Stevie Johnson he was the one who made
[424.20 → 429.08] him successful that was his view of God, and today we're going to talk about the
[429.08 → 434.56] father's heart we're gonna talk about our view of God now the challenge for us and
[434.56 → 441.64] the challenge for Stevie is that many times in our lives our experiences are more
[441.64 → 448.22] formative in our lives than our beliefs and theology oftentimes our experiences are
[448.22 → 451.94] more formative in our lives than our beliefs and our theology, and I'll
[451.94 → 457.38] articulate this a bit so for Stevie his experience of dropping that pass really
[457.38 → 462.98] formed his theology about God I'm never going to forget this I think God is looking
[462.98 → 467.12] at that and going oh Stevie come on man like this is not about me, you know what
[467.12 → 472.76] this is about you this isn't about me our experiences sometimes form what we
[472.76 → 476.96] believe in our theology just a few years ago there was a Pew research study that was
[476.96 → 481.28] released, and they surveyed people about God they had a bunch of questions about
[481.28 → 488.12] God and that holistically in this study they found that 72% of people believed
[488.12 → 494.42] that God didn't speak to them okay so 28% were Christians no I'm joking 72% of
[494.42 → 498.08] people believed God didn't speak to them and of those who believed in a
[498.08 → 503.88] God 40% believed that God punished them are you with me 40% of those who believe in God
[503.88 → 510.12] believed God punished them 61% believed God was going to judge them for their deeds
[510.12 → 514.98] 77% of people believed God had protected them at some time now what is this what
[514.98 → 519.60] does this data even show it shows that people have beliefs about God that are
[519.60 → 523.92] formed by what they think and what they experience more than what God shows
[523.92 → 529.12] himself as in the word and so today I want to come back to the father's heart and I want to
[529.12 → 533.98] look to Jesus in here and see how do we discover the father's heart as we look to
[533.98 → 539.38] Jesus so if you would with me turn to John 17, and we want to dive into John 17 and
[539.38 → 542.26] read a little bit in there today if you don't have your Bible with you please open
[542.26 → 547.36] your Bible app whatever you use and let's go to John 17 now I want to just give us a
[547.36 → 550.78] bit of context here, so this is what generally is called the high priestly prayer of
[550.78 → 556.18] Jesus in John 17 he's praying not only is he praying but as he's praying he's talking
[556.18 → 561.28] about the authority he's been given he's also talking about the fact that he
[561.28 → 565.36] shared the glory with the father, and he's shown the father to his people so
[565.36 → 572.08] let's pick up in John 17 24, and we're going to read it 26 father I desire that they
[572.08 → 577.94] whom you have given me may be with me where I am to see the glory that you have
[577.94 → 583.10] given me because you loved me before the foundations of the world let me repeat
[583.10 → 587.70] that because you loved me before the foundations of the world Oh righteous
[587.70 → 594.08] father even though the world does not know you I know you and these know that
[594.08 → 600.32] you have sent me I made it known I try made known to them your name and I will
[600.32 → 606.32] continue to make it known that the love with which you have loved me may be in
[606.32 → 614.54] them and I in them pretty powerful passage pretty powerful passage not
[614.54 → 619.04] because Jesus is praying eloquently or because we seem carving of the time it's
[619.04 → 623.66] because of what he's saying and in fact in this scripture in this context of the
[623.66 → 630.80] scripture in John 17 Jesus refers to the father no less than six times six
[630.80 → 634.22] times that's a very powerful thing because Jesus is trying to reveal to us
[634.22 → 638.24] something very important about God the father he's revealing something very
[638.24 → 642.86] important about God the father that before the earth was founded before where
[642.86 → 647.36] you're standing now is here before Jesus was incarnate in flesh something was
[647.36 → 651.56] happening now if you ask kids what was happening before creation I don't know
[651.56 → 657.38] sometimes when I ask adults what was happening before creation I don't know you
[657.38 → 661.44] know what Jesus tells us that before the foundations of the world there was two
[661.44 → 667.50] things there was glory and there was love glory and love in the Trinity the
[667.50 → 671.16] beauty of the Trinity the three in one there was glory and love, and he says I
[671.16 → 675.66] am I showing them the love that you have loved me with before the foundations of
[675.66 → 680.04] the world before creation something was happening before the world was set in
[680.04 → 684.06] motion before things were spoken into existence something was happening there was
[684.06 → 692.34] love shared perfectly in the Trinity beautiful what matters because for you
[692.34 → 696.42] and me when we look at whom the father is where do we go not what we see on the
[696.42 → 701.44] earth what we see here and how we see Jesus revealing it now what's so
[701.44 → 705.00] interesting about this is if you look at the Old Testament the Old Testament
[705.00 → 710.64] contains about nine references to the word or the name father you see about nine
[710.64 → 714.54] times okay in different references but as you go into the New Testament Matthew
[714.54 → 718.62] Mark Luke and John what we call the synoptic Gospels you'll see it about 65
[718.62 → 726.30] times how many times you see them the Gospel of John approximately 100 times
[726.30 → 730.62] well what's what's God trying to get at here what's God trying to do by this
[730.62 → 735.60] what is Jesus trying to show us by the prayer there's a whole new revelation of how
[735.60 → 740.52] we're supposed to understand God, and what is it tied to it's tied to the name
[740.52 → 747.06] father stay with me father a hundred times in the book of John we see that
[747.06 → 752.32] coming what I think is amazing about that is that Jesus is demonstrating who the
[752.32 → 755.64] father is and through his very relationship with each person he's
[755.64 → 761.08] demonstrating how the father interacts and what we're to experience now if you
[761.08 → 764.08] took a scripture, and you look at scripture all these father references and you
[764.08 → 767.84] looked at the world we all know that the world in which we live is kind of
[767.84 → 771.88] sometimes in contrast to scripture and in contrast to the father it just doesn't
[771.88 → 777.58] always equate and so what I see here is our world is not a world that generally
[777.58 → 782.40] has love coming first have you ever experienced this just the other day I
[782.40 → 785.98] was driving down 68th Avenue here, and I was heading towards 200th Street and there
[785.98 → 790.60] was a young guy looked like he had just purchased this car, and he stalled his car out
[790.60 → 793.58] when he was turning on to 200th heading south now if you've been in that
[793.58 → 797.66] intersection in busy times you know it's a crazy rush down to 100 it's supposed to
[797.66 → 800.78] be like I knew what the speed limit is but everyone's doing like Mach 10 down
[800.78 → 804.62] there because they're coming down the hill now this was in the evening this is in
[804.62 → 807.86] the evening, so there were very few cars, and he stalled it so me my wife are
[807.86 → 815.12] feeling bad and one single car one is coming down the road honking at him and
[815.12 → 817.96] like shaking his fist and pulls up beside him, and you can tell the guys
[817.96 → 822.44] exchanging some words I'm thinking there's one car this guy stole this car he's not
[822.44 → 826.52] trying to interrupt traffic but in our world what comes first not always love
[826.52 → 831.50] okay it's not always love it's usually frustration anger those things come out
[831.50 → 834.08] of people and when you drive those things all kind of come out in us right
[834.08 → 839.24] confessions right okay we've not been perfect but in God's economy and his
[839.24 → 844.28] spirituality that we follow as our faith guess what love comes first why because
[844.28 → 849.02] love was first before the foundations of the world love comes first if you turn
[849.02 → 853.58] with me to Genesis 3 I want to go back just to a couple scriptures there this
[853.58 → 858.92] is the account of the fall in Genesis 3 verses 13 and 17 and guys this is where
[858.92 → 864.20] we get some of the stuff that's kind of been hanging over us as men and ladies
[864.20 → 868.58] you're not going to get put on the spot don't worry about that Genesis 3 verse 17
[868.58 → 872.92] and to Adam God said because he had listened to the voice of your wife and have
[872.92 → 877.70] eaten of the tree of which I commanded you shall not eat of it cursed is the
[877.70 → 881.84] ground because of you in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life
[881.84 → 885.46] sounds very encouraging doesn't it cursed is the ground in pain you should eat of
[885.46 → 889.34] its thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the
[889.34 → 894.84] plants of the field verse 19 by the sweat of your faiths you shall eat bread till you
[894.84 → 898.88] return to the ground for out of it you were taken for you are dust and to dust you
[898.88 → 904.08] shall return yeah just really encouraging scripture there thank you, Lord, I just I look at that, and I go
[904.08 → 912.24] God this explains a lot to me, I'm going to have to work I'm going to have to tend the
[912.24 → 917.64] ground by pain and by sweat and through thorns and thistles I'm going to need to get
[917.64 → 921.96] through now what's so interesting about this is this was the curse that was put
[921.96 → 927.54] on by the fall this is what was on the man this was the curse on the man, and I'm
[927.54 → 931.98] really glad of this that God is a God of redemption aren't you glad of that and you
[931.98 → 938.40] know we see here we see that this curse is not what Christ came to put on us
[938.40 → 942.78] Christ came to redeem us from the curse, but we see this is that this curse puts
[942.78 → 948.72] us into two kinds of identity places production and performance guys I'm
[948.72 → 954.78] talking to you right now production and performance and I said Father's Day is a
[954.78 → 960.78] day when we thank dads for all they do when you say thank you for all you do you know we
[960.78 → 967.74] reinforce that very curse of production and performance what came before production and
[967.74 → 973.56] performance the love given by the Father to Jesus through the Spirit sharing love and glory
[973.56 → 978.42] and God redeems us from this now I want you to turn with me into the New Testament because I love
[978.42 → 984.12] I love reading about the baptism of Jesus so let's turn over to Matthew 3 and I want to read about the baptism of Jesus and
[984.12 → 991.12] and as we keep going here in Matthew 3 we're going to read in verses 13 to 17 of Matthew 3
[991.12 → 997.68] then Jesus came from the Galilee to be to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him and John
[997.68 → 1004.48] would have prevented him saying I need to be baptized by you and do you come to me, but Jesus answered let
[1004.48 → 1009.86] it is so now for thus is fitting to fulfill our righteousness then he consented and when he was
[1009.86 → 1014.86] baptized immediately he went up from the water and behold the heavens were open to him, and he saw the Spirit of God
[1014.86 → 1022.86] descending like a dove and coming to rest on him and behold a voice from heaven said and say it with me this is my beloved
[1022.86 → 1026.86] son with whom I am well pleased
[1026.86 → 1036.86] Wow beloved son that's that's that's repeated in the books of Mark and the books of Luke not only that but in an event called the transfiguration what is the same thing that God says about his son?
[1036.86 → 1043.86] this is my beloved son listen to him, you know what I love about this passage of scripture God says he's well pleased, and I look at the life of Jesus what had Jesus done at this point what miracle had Jesus done what teaching had Jesus done what do we know about Jesus well we know he was born angelic prophecies
[1043.86 → 1050.86] we know that he grew in wisdom and stature with men we know that he visited Jerusalem as was his custom, but he had done nothing of significance
[1050.86 → 1057.86] you know what I love about this passage of scripture God says he's well pleased, and I look at the life of Jesus what had Jesus done at this point what miracle had Jesus done what
[1057.86 → 1072.86] what teaching had Jesus done what do we know about Jesus well we know he was born angelic prophecies we know that he grew in wisdom and stature with men we know that he visited Jerusalem as was his custom, but he had done nothing of significance
[1072.86 → 1101.86] why is this so important that this happens well John 1724 says that the father loved him before the foundations of the world before he had done anything he was loved and what happens here is that before he does anything on the earth God is well pleased with him do you see what God is trying to get to us as a message through the baptism of Jesus and through John 1724 is that Jesus's identity is not based in his activity are you with me church
[1101.86 → 1125.86] Jesus is that identity is not based in his activity it's not based in his actions and God the father says I approve of you before your actions I approve of you and I affirm you before you've done anything of activity and this is so backwards to our world how many people have worked a job where you've had a performance review
[1125.86 → 1128.86] self-review
[1128.86 → 1154.86] seldom if ever do you have a job that gives you a character review now things are changing slightly people talk about the culture of how you do it in the character, and it's changing in our education system but education system still has grades my son super proud he just got an 81 on this math and for him that's like 110 percent that's awesome we're celebrating that with him, but it's still a mark of how well you did and how well you didn't do you know what that's based in
[1154.86 → 1163.86] that's based in that's based in that performance of the call of the fall not what Jesus wants to redeem in our lives
[1163.86 → 1181.86] now one of the things that we read about Jesus this is my beloved son he says he's well pleased we understand this that Jesus is the beloved of the father that he is the beloved of the father
[1181.86 → 1185.86] now one thing about God we understand is that if God's a good father
[1185.86 → 1190.86] there are good things that come out of them and I want to give you a thought today to chew on
[1190.86 → 1196.86] we often say that God is a healer, and he is a healer right
[1196.86 → 1200.86] we often say God is a provider, and he's a provider have you ever experienced his provision
[1200.86 → 1206.86] we also say that God is he's a shepherd and he's a protector, and we've experienced his protection
[1206.86 → 1233.86] but in our lives when we don't get the healing we pray for or when we don't get the job we pray for or when we don't get the protection we pray for all of a sudden leaves us in a precarious situation where if you relate to God based on what he does then it changes your relationship with him but if you relate to God on who he is that's what he calls us to do because if you relate to God because he's a healer guess what if he didn't heal your life
[1233.86 → 1263.84] you relate to God because he's a healer guess what if he didn't heal your friend who had cancer all of a sudden maybe you're not who you said you were God maybe you're not as good as you say you are because you didn't heal no guess what God is still good, and he's a father and in his good fatherhood he knows exactly what needs to happen on this earth if you relate to him as a father then he understands that good fathers give good gifts in the right times right now I've got a son he's 16 now years ago I gave him a
[1263.84 → 1293.82] knife because it was the time to give my son a knife now at four years old is not a good time to give a child a knife or a son a knife amen anyone with me okay but at the right time in the right place a knife is an awesome gift same thing with a car if you're going to help your children get a car your grandchildren get a car getting them a car at 10 years old is not a good thing but 16 17 18 that's a good thing we even know as fathers and mothers on earth to give gifts in the right time guess
[1293.82 → 1323.80] what God knows that too so when you think of him and God you didn't provide you didn't do it how I wanted you to do it no, no no, no God is the father and out of that fatherhood out of that love he has he provides in the right time and in the right way out of that loving fatherhood he heals in the right time and in the right way out of that fatherhood he protects in the right time and the right way so the call for us is to relate first to the identity
[1323.80 → 1349.42] identity of God and second to his activity just like God the father did with Jesus first it was identity you're my son and whom I'm well pleased and then second was the activities that happen and here's what I love Jesus says the name beloved that's a good name like it just it kind of warms my heart when I think man Jesus is the beloved of the father it's a deep term
[1349.42 → 1362.54] and that's a privileged place to be that's a name with position but here's what's so beautiful that we see in the New Testament do you know who gets that name in the New Testament
[1362.54 → 1388.66] me and you 57 times in the New Testament believers are called the beloved just sit that for us 57 times you are called the beloved turn to the person beside you say you're beloved online grab your kids wrangle them in they're trying to eat food right now they're getting the fishy crackers tell them they're beloved if you can
[1388.66 → 1418.64] now turn to the other person the same privilege position and name that Jesus got before he did activities was given to you and me now we are in the beloved what does it say in Ephesians 1 6 you and I are accepted in the beloved oh man that can't get any better I'm accepted in the beloved like I'm like in the best place I can be not because of what I'm
[1418.64 → 1448.62] done because of what Jesus has done I'm accepted in the beloved Romans 8 14 16 and Jonathan reference this is that if we're led by the spirit we receive the spirit of adoption we become children of God and by that spirit we call him Abba the Aramaic word that is the most enduring word you can use as a father we get to call him father why because we've been accepted in the beloved we've been brought in by the spirit of adoption and God wants to work in our lives
[1448.62 → 1475.28] now for you and me for each person who's listening all of you online as well the challenge is where are we going to root our faith and our belief are we going to put it in our activities are we going to put it in our performance are we going to put it in our financial position are we going to put it in the things we own are we going to put it in whom the father says we are
[1475.28 → 1505.14] guys let's talk to you for a second it's hardest for us, we generally have built in, and I believe it's because of that curse back there we have built in to perform to do well you know to make money to provide stable homes and housing, and you know I talked to some of my friends who are young adults in our church and yeah I just talked to my dad the other day oh how things going with your dad well he asked me how my car was doing he asked me if I needed any money for rent you know that was it you know that was kind of like that's the dad relationship right
[1505.14 → 1535.14] but guys God wants us to go so much deeper and let me be honest for us to consider that we are the beloved it kind of works against your view of your masculinity sometimes it sometimes just grinds you God wants you to be intimate with him, we'll say and for guys we kind of go like ah that's not the word I want to use is there another word you know ultimately God wants you to connect with him
[1535.14 → 1542.14] and you know that God wants you to be able to pass the performance mentalities the doing mentalities understand this that God loves you when you don't do things your wife might not but God does okay
[1542.14 → 1555.14] wives just say to you don't hold your husbands up to perfection and performance give them grace
[1555.14 → 1584.90] grace for grace on them that scripture says grace upon grace that's what we're called to do so let me ask you this as a question as we continue in Genesis 3 there was a curse over the man there was are we going to live under the curse or are we going to live under the cross are you with me because if you live under the cross we live in the space where Jesus was made the curse for us so that we could live free and receive the
[1584.90 → 1612.90] adoption as sons guys you are sons of the most high God and because of that he's given you a privileged position you are in the beloved and your role now is to let others know that they are beloved as well so when you think of your kids when you think of your wife when you think of your neighbours the people you work with to let them know that you are in this beloved and that through that and out of that is what God wants to do through your life
[1612.90 → 1616.58] turn with me if you would to the book of first John
[1616.58 → 1622.62] and we'll be done by about noon today so don't worry if we're going long we'll be done by about noon
[1622.62 → 1632.40] I'm kidding you I'm kidding you I understand that Pastor Dave makes some jokes about me, and I'm never here to defend myself so you know my wife was like well don't make a joke that would hurt Pastor Dave
[1632.40 → 1641.00] but you know he really told me you're going to preach on Revelation I was excited because we're doing Revelation in the fall then he says like well why don't you just preach one of your best sermons to us like your favourite
[1641.00 → 1648.86] sermon and I thought well why don't I go and find one of Dave's worst sermons and one of the ones that people like the worst and when I preach it better and that's what I'll do but no
[1648.86 → 1652.40] this is something I believe God laid in my heart for your church today
[1652.40 → 1668.70] first John 3 the first part of the verse is this see what kind of love the father has given to us that we should be called children of God and so
[1668.70 → 1698.68] we are seen what kind of love the father has given to us that we should be called children of God, and so we are that is a benefit and a blessing to be a child of God it didn't come without a cost it came with Christ giving his very life, and now we can live under the cross not under the curse and when I think about this the first question that comes to my mind is like why
[1698.68 → 1725.68] why God why would I ever deserve this love this favour or this blessing well the truth is that I don't deserve it because what Christ did he's welcomed me into it, I don't deserve it on my own there's nothing I could do to attain to it there 's's nothing I could do to make it right to get it but because of what Christ has done he has made you worthy guys fathers today God has made you worthy to be his children
[1725.68 → 1740.10] and even when you struggle with sin and brokenness God still brings you close wants you to confess and repent and wants to show you how much he loves you even through those times grace upon grace is what he gives us
[1740.10 → 1769.98] I'm not worthy of it but God has made me worthy 1st Timothy 2 13 says this even when I am faithless God is still faithful to me Jeremiah 31 3 says the covenantal blessing see I have loved you with an everlasting love he's loved us with an everlasting love and Ephesians 3 it tells us Paul's praying that we would have the ability to comprehend the length the height the depth the love that surpasses all
[1769.98 → 1799.38] knowledge this is how big God's love this is how big God's love is for you through the heart of the father we don't deserve it but guess what we get the favour and the blessing, and we get the love because of what Christ has done and a lot of times the issue comes to our own value Lord am I even worth am I worth this like and the cross is the ultimate declaration that you are worth this love guys you're worth this love
[1799.38 → 1817.10] you're worth this love fathers you're worth this love you're worth being called the beloved one of my favourite authors Dr. Rob Reamer in his book called soul care he says this amazing statement which I love to quote he says the issue of my value was settled at the cross
[1817.10 → 1824.80] the issue of my value is settled at the cross just chew on that for the next lifetime
[1824.80 → 1831.74] every time you feel unworthy of something every time you feel that your value has been pushed down
[1831.74 → 1836.42] you look to what Jesus did on that cross and the issue of your value is settled why
[1836.42 → 1842.30] because Hebrews tells us for the joy set before him, he endured the cross I'm convinced that the joy is one day
[1842.30 → 1848.78] he's looking forward to the marriage feast of the lamb while he will meet us in heaven, and he will see the price he paid for the people he's redeemed
[1848.78 → 1854.78] that is the joy of the Lord you are worth it dads you're worth it and whatever words have been spoken over you
[1854.78 → 1864.66] in your childhood in your marriage anytime anywhere at your job wherever God speaks the words of blessing and beloved over you
[1864.66 → 1872.84] and as we embrace that as we understand that as we sit with that that changes and transforms who we are
[1872.84 → 1882.74] remember this Jesus is the beloved and now guess what we are now his beloved that's all of us none of us is left out
[1882.74 → 1886.24] you follow Jesus you are his disciple you are his beloved
[1886.24 → 1896.58] Jesus is accepted by the father guess what you and I are accepted by the father because of the work of Jesus you are now accepted
[1896.58 → 1904.14] you ever thought about this why is the spirit of adoption something so prevalent in scripture in Romans 8 and in Galatians 4
[1904.14 → 1908.50] think about this Jesus do you remember this he was adopted by an earthly father
[1908.50 → 1916.88] Joseph wasn't his natural father Joseph wasn't his natural father there's an adoptive thing that was happening there Jesus was adopted now we are adopted
[1916.88 → 1923.92] you see what God calls us to do on a day like today where we celebrate and honour fathers
[1923.92 → 1930.06] is to reform the way we think and believe about the father in heaven
[1930.06 → 1943.06] to ask for the grace to look at him as the model and the filter by which we view our world rather than looking at the brokenness of our world and the brokenness of fathers and put that on God
[1943.06 → 1945.18] he wants it the other way around
[1945.18 → 1948.24] now if you would
[1948.24 → 1951.44] I just like you to imagine with me
[1951.44 → 1954.24] if we all embrace this
[1954.24 → 1965.24] if we all embrace the father's heart where he says you are my beloved you're approved of before your activity you're affirmed before your activity
[1965.24 → 1975.62] can you imagine if we leaned into this, and we lived into this how this would change our world guess what it would change how we act and interact with people
[1975.62 → 1983.56] because you wouldn't interact to try to get people's approval and affirmation you've already got it by the most important person the God of the universe
[1983.56 → 1987.90] you wouldn't strive to get it you know you would have it
[1987.90 → 1997.02] it would change our view of ourselves as it comes to our worth and our value because we would see that God sees infinite value in his creation because he took his son
[1997.02 → 2003.88] from heaven and put him down on the earth and onto a cross just to redeem us it would change how we view ourselves
[2003.88 → 2006.94] man guys it would change how we parent our children
[2006.94 → 2012.54] because rather than things that sometimes come natural for dads which is authority
[2012.54 → 2014.16] and control
[2014.16 → 2016.12] and the proper behaviour
[2016.12 → 2019.60] we would say the most important thing that my children know is that they're beloved
[2019.60 → 2021.60] they're beloved
[2021.60 → 2024.02] I love my son
[2024.02 → 2025.26] man I love my son
[2025.26 → 2028.62] he's got the privilege he's serving here on the summer team and I love that
[2028.62 → 2031.48] I love that our churches are so close that my son gets to serve here on the team
[2031.48 → 2032.68] I love him
[2032.68 → 2034.68] but as a father I fight
[2034.68 → 2037.78] I fight the things that oh I want you to do that right I want you to do that right
[2037.78 → 2038.58] okay no
[2038.58 → 2044.34] the father's not calling my father wants me to leave in the place where he knows that he is affirmed by me
[2044.34 → 2045.54] no matter what he does
[2045.54 → 2048.52] because that's the same message that scripture has for him as a believer
[2048.52 → 2052.74] that's the message I need to have, and it doesn't mean we don't want our kids to follow and obey
[2052.74 → 2053.48] yes
[2053.48 → 2055.46] but that's not the primary motivation
[2055.46 → 2058.38] the primary motivation is that they would understand they are the beloved
[2058.38 → 2069.34] so today if we all embrace this if we all lived into this for each of us man and woman here we would know that today is not about what we do and what we've done
[2069.34 → 2073.42] it's about who we are in the eyes of the father
[2073.42 → 2084.48] it's about transferring ourselves from that curse that was in the fall to putting ourselves under the cross where the redemptive work of Jesus is redeeming us and calling us now the beloved
[2084.48 → 2088.48] dad it's about celebrating what you do
[2088.48 → 2091.44] it's about celebrating who you are
[2091.44 → 2093.44] and who you're becoming
[2093.44 → 2094.72] to the father
[2094.72 → 2096.54] because we're all in a journey
[2096.54 → 2098.42] and we're all moving forward
[2098.42 → 2101.44] everyone here it's about the fact that you are now
[2101.44 → 2103.74] the beloved of the father
[2103.74 → 2106.84] and if you learn anything from today
[2106.84 → 2109.28] wives
[2109.28 → 2112.00] kids if you bless your dads in any way today
[2112.00 → 2115.60] bless them because they're part of the beloved
[2115.60 → 2117.70] that's what they need to hear
[2117.70 → 2121.60] we'll call the worship team up and as they come
[2121.60 → 2124.88] I wonder if we could just pray for all the dads here today
[2124.88 → 2126.74] all the dads online
[2126.74 → 2130.28] so if you're beside a dad just put your hand upon him
[2130.28 → 2135.82] if you're beside a dad who wants to be or a man who wants to be a dad hasn't become a dad yet put your hand on him
[2135.82 → 2145.42] and if you're online just reach out to your closest father there or even if your dad's not there just again I would encourage you put your hand on your heart we want to pray over dads today
[2145.42 → 2148.86] Lord we want to be reformed
[2148.86 → 2151.02] by the father's heart
[2151.02 → 2151.90] by the faith
[2151.90 → 2156.66] by the fact that Jesus was loved before the foundations of the world by the father
[2156.66 → 2162.56] father that he was blessed and approved as a beloved son before his activity he
[2162.56 → 2166.24] received his identity and Lord now you put that on us as we are now called the
[2166.24 → 2171.00] beloved see what kind of love the father has loved us that we should be called
[2171.00 → 2174.76] children of God and Lord where we feel like we don't deserve it where we feel
[2174.76 → 2179.14] like we're not worth it Lord you have qualified us to be partakers of your
[2179.14 → 2183.18] grace and glory because of the work of Jesus and Lord we need to understand
[2183.18 → 2187.14] that we're accepted in the beloved Lord that the issue of our value is settled
[2187.14 → 2191.28] on the cross because you went before us so Lord now we can receive the father's
[2191.28 → 2194.70] heart that we are the beloved we can receive that we're accepted receive that
[2194.70 → 2198.64] we're adopted and Lord for every man here and every father here Lord we pray the
[2198.64 → 2202.62] blessing on them that they are loved because of who they are to you and who
[2202.62 → 2206.58] they're becoming to the father Lord not whether they perform or that they get it
[2206.58 → 2213.12] right Lord they are loved by you Lord shake us of any and all lies that set up
[2213.12 → 2220.40] a different identity, but Lord give us the truth today that you love us because you
[2220.40 → 2228.16] are a God of love and so father God as we close in worship Lord we pray that as the
[2228.16 → 2231.32] lyrics of the song say that we would build our life
[2231.32 → 2235.44] you
[2235.44 → 2237.44] you
[2237.44 → 2239.44] you
[2239.44 → 2241.44] you
[2241.44 → 2243.44] you
[2243.44 → 2245.44] you
[2245.44 → 2247.44] you
[2247.44 → 2249.44] you
[2249.44 → 2251.44] you
