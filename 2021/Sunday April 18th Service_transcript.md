[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  Thank you.
[62.00 --> 66.00]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Thank you.
[92.00 --> 94.00]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Thank you.
[122.00 --> 124.00]  Thank you.
[124.00 --> 126.00]  Thank you.
[126.00 --> 128.00]  Thank you.
[128.00 --> 130.00]  Thank you.
[130.00 --> 132.00]  Thank you.
[132.00 --> 136.30]  you said to me, perhaps this is the book that will give us some perspective
[136.30 --> 138.92]  on the times in which we live.
[140.04 --> 142.96]  And so this sermon series, I know, is at least for two of us.
[143.76 --> 146.26]  And I'm hoping that it will do precisely that.
[147.14 --> 149.04]  As we say through every one of our sermon series,
[149.10 --> 150.92]  we want you to read through this book with us,
[150.92 --> 153.62]  especially the first three chapters that we're going to be hunkering down in.
[153.78 --> 155.92]  Use this in your devotional time, your prayer time.
[156.40 --> 160.44]  I know that our youth pastor, Misha, has put together sort of a one-page sheet
[160.44 --> 162.48]  for our youth to just make sermon notes.
[162.76 --> 164.40]  And I will say just on the side there,
[164.74 --> 167.08]  it's been great to see some of our youth and our adults
[167.08 --> 169.40]  putting together these creative lettering sermon notes.
[169.68 --> 172.32]  And it's been an encouragement to me to see the way that you're interacting
[172.32 --> 174.00]  with our preaching series.
[175.08 --> 177.74]  The final comment I want to make is that throughout this series,
[177.90 --> 179.90]  we're going to be praying for the persecuted church.
[181.18 --> 184.06]  The churches in Asia Minor are being persecuted.
[184.42 --> 186.56]  You're going to hear a lot more about that over the course of this series.
[186.70 --> 188.20]  And it just seems fitting to us
[188.20 --> 192.06]  that we take the gaze off of ourselves for the next number of weeks
[192.06 --> 193.68]  and we pray for our brothers and sisters,
[194.18 --> 195.02]  which I read this week,
[195.14 --> 199.60]  one in eight of the worldwide church is being actively persecuted.
[199.80 --> 202.98]  And I say actively because I've had some bristling lately
[202.98 --> 206.88]  when people describe the circumstances that we're in as persecution.
[207.68 --> 208.96]  And yes, it's not great.
[209.04 --> 211.08]  I don't like preaching to a camera.
[211.50 --> 213.44]  And it's very difficult that we can't gather.
[213.58 --> 214.84]  And there's been unfairness perhaps,
[214.84 --> 217.36]  but this is not persecution.
[219.20 --> 222.56]  And we're going to send you basically a PDF
[222.56 --> 226.16]  of the top 50 churches in the world right now
[226.16 --> 226.94]  that are being persecuted.
[227.06 --> 228.02]  As you pray to those,
[228.08 --> 230.20]  and we do encourage you as families throughout this whole series
[230.20 --> 231.94]  to pray for the persecuted church.
[232.00 --> 232.66]  And as you do that,
[232.72 --> 233.82]  you will gain some perspective
[233.82 --> 235.38]  on what is happening in our world
[235.38 --> 236.80]  and what is happening here.
[237.10 --> 239.04]  And I hope we're able to intercede
[239.04 --> 240.92]  and pray with our brothers and sisters
[240.92 --> 242.26]  who are suffering.
[242.70 --> 244.70]  So that's going to happen throughout this series.
[244.70 --> 247.02]  I invite you,
[247.08 --> 247.70]  if you've got your Bible,
[247.82 --> 249.42]  turn with me to Revelation chapter 1.
[249.62 --> 250.72]  We're going to read the whole chapter.
[251.26 --> 253.44]  I was going to preach on a smaller section within it,
[253.48 --> 254.96]  but I just couldn't bring myself to.
[255.04 --> 257.50]  So I'm just going to read the entire first chapter
[257.50 --> 259.06]  of Revelation with us this morning.
[259.06 --> 289.04]  Revelation chapter 1.
[289.06 --> 294.06]  John.
[294.06 --> 294.58]  John.
[295.06 --> 297.88]  To the seven churches in the province of Asia,
[298.58 --> 302.40]  grace and peace to you from him who is and who was and who is to come,
[302.66 --> 304.74]  and from the seven spirits before his throne,
[305.30 --> 306.52]  and from Jesus Christ,
[306.88 --> 308.36]  who is the faithful witness,
[308.82 --> 310.08]  the firstborn from the dead,
[310.14 --> 312.80]  and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[313.58 --> 317.24]  To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,
[317.24 --> 321.18]  and has made us to be a kingdom and priest to serve his God and Father.
[321.56 --> 324.62]  To him be the glory and the power forever and ever.
[324.78 --> 325.06]  Amen.
[326.38 --> 326.88]  Look,
[327.44 --> 329.14]  he is coming with the clouds,
[329.44 --> 330.88]  and every eye will see him,
[330.98 --> 332.32]  even those who pierced him.
[332.90 --> 335.50]  And all peoples on earth will mourn because of him.
[335.50 --> 337.12]  So shall it be.
[337.46 --> 337.88]  Amen.
[339.52 --> 341.90]  I am the Alpha and the Omega,
[342.10 --> 343.16]  says the Lord God,
[343.32 --> 346.34]  who is and who was and who was is to come,
[346.66 --> 347.44]  the Almighty.
[349.46 --> 349.74]  I,
[349.86 --> 350.18]  John,
[350.66 --> 353.00]  your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom
[353.00 --> 355.42]  and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus,
[355.78 --> 358.50]  was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God
[358.50 --> 360.18]  and the testimony of Jesus.
[361.10 --> 361.86]  On the Lord's day,
[361.94 --> 365.68]  I was in the spirit and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
[366.12 --> 366.58]  which said,
[366.96 --> 368.98]  write on a scroll what you see
[368.98 --> 370.74]  and send it to the seven churches,
[371.28 --> 371.78]  to Ephesus,
[372.42 --> 372.84]  Smyrna,
[373.28 --> 373.72]  Pergamum,
[373.88 --> 374.40]  Thyatira,
[374.86 --> 375.36]  Sardis,
[375.72 --> 376.22]  Philadelphia,
[376.50 --> 377.34]  and Laodicea.
[378.18 --> 381.92]  I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me.
[381.92 --> 383.48]  And when I turned,
[383.64 --> 385.92]  I saw seven golden lampstands.
[385.92 --> 389.90]  And among the lampstands was someone like the Son of Man,
[390.46 --> 393.00]  dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet
[393.00 --> 395.54]  and with a golden sash around his chest.
[396.34 --> 398.36]  The hair on his head was like white wool,
[398.98 --> 399.98]  as white as snow,
[400.32 --> 402.84]  and his eyes were like blazing fire.
[403.56 --> 406.12]  His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace
[406.12 --> 408.56]  and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.
[409.00 --> 410.02]  In his right hand,
[410.22 --> 411.52]  he held seven stars
[411.52 --> 413.62]  and coming out of his mouth was a sharp,
[414.02 --> 414.98]  double-edged sword.
[414.98 --> 419.68]  His face was like the sun shining in all of its brilliance.
[420.56 --> 421.92]  When I saw him,
[422.48 --> 425.26]  I fell at his feet as though dead.
[426.20 --> 428.70]  Then he placed his right hand on me and said,
[429.36 --> 430.82]  Do not be afraid.
[431.54 --> 434.00]  I am the first and the last.
[434.32 --> 435.56]  I am the living one.
[435.68 --> 437.34]  I was dead and now look,
[437.72 --> 440.58]  I am alive forever and ever.
[440.58 --> 443.92]  And I hold the keys of death and Hades.
[445.02 --> 446.90]  Write therefore what you have seen,
[447.24 --> 450.48]  both what is now and what will take place later.
[451.02 --> 453.98]  The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand
[453.98 --> 456.06]  and the seven golden lampstands is this.
[456.62 --> 459.18]  The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches,
[459.18 --> 463.02]  and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
[467.40 --> 470.82]  Well, let's begin with what we all feel about Revelation.
[471.82 --> 474.22]  This is a very unique book.
[474.56 --> 475.52]  In fact, just this week,
[475.58 --> 477.08]  I had two conversations where people said,
[477.16 --> 477.64]  You know what?
[478.14 --> 479.64]  I kind of avoid this book.
[480.06 --> 481.72]  It's just a bit too strange.
[481.82 --> 482.82]  And maybe for some of you,
[482.90 --> 483.78]  you're new to our church,
[483.86 --> 484.64]  you're new to this book,
[484.64 --> 485.02]  you think,
[485.44 --> 487.68]  What was it that we just read there?
[488.54 --> 492.16]  Jesus described as this fiery white hair,
[492.48 --> 493.50]  beet-like bronze,
[493.62 --> 495.64]  a sword coming out of his mouth.
[496.24 --> 498.24]  What is this book of Revelation?
[499.56 --> 501.68]  And it won't surprise many of you to hear me say
[501.68 --> 504.00]  that this is not just a complex book.
[504.64 --> 506.84]  It is a controversial book.
[507.64 --> 510.40]  Any crazy idea a Christian in the past has had
[510.40 --> 512.10]  about the world, the future,
[512.10 --> 514.66]  they have found a passage in Revelation
[514.66 --> 516.74]  to back that idea up.
[517.58 --> 519.94]  And it seems every generation has new ways
[519.94 --> 521.18]  of reading and seeing
[521.18 --> 524.26]  and sort of a lens to which to read this book
[524.26 --> 525.70]  and what it says.
[526.32 --> 527.70]  I mean, two examples are,
[528.10 --> 529.50]  one that I read this week is that
[529.50 --> 531.22]  the locusts in Revelation 9,
[531.92 --> 532.76]  according to some,
[533.42 --> 534.62]  are Apache helicopters
[534.62 --> 536.30]  that are part of the U.S. Army.
[537.38 --> 539.18]  Or think about the mark of the beast
[539.18 --> 540.18]  in Revelation 13.
[540.18 --> 541.36]  I'm sure even among us,
[541.42 --> 542.84]  we've heard many different takes
[542.84 --> 544.38]  on what that mark is.
[544.86 --> 546.70]  I remember people in my grandparents' generation
[546.70 --> 548.42]  saying it's the Visa card.
[549.12 --> 551.04]  Now it's the RFID chip.
[551.44 --> 553.72]  And some have suggested it's the vaccine.
[554.92 --> 556.18]  We fill in our blanks,
[556.24 --> 557.90]  and this is a controversial book.
[558.30 --> 558.90]  And for that reason,
[559.06 --> 560.30]  a lot of us avoid it.
[560.80 --> 562.72]  And I just want to tell you at the outset,
[563.42 --> 565.32]  if you've got really hard, really good,
[565.42 --> 567.12]  really difficult questions about this book,
[567.12 --> 569.86]  we happen to have an in-house scholar in residence
[569.86 --> 570.90]  named Michael Goheen
[570.90 --> 573.80]  who taught this book last spring with our church.
[573.88 --> 574.94]  And you can bypass me
[574.94 --> 576.18]  and just go straight to him
[576.18 --> 578.22]  with those incredibly difficult questions
[578.22 --> 579.30]  about the book of Revelation.
[582.08 --> 583.30]  We're going to hunker down, though,
[583.34 --> 586.00]  and look at the seven letters written to the churches.
[586.24 --> 587.08]  And before I do that,
[587.12 --> 589.52]  I do want to touch on how to read this book.
[590.28 --> 590.90]  You'll see,
[591.02 --> 593.28]  if you took close attention to chapter one,
[593.28 --> 596.54]  that this book is described in three different ways
[596.54 --> 597.56]  in terms of its genre.
[597.86 --> 599.02]  At the beginning, it says,
[599.60 --> 601.40]  the revelation from Jesus Christ.
[601.50 --> 602.30]  This is a revelation,
[602.44 --> 604.16]  or the Greek word there is apocalypse.
[604.46 --> 606.30]  This is apocalyptic literature.
[606.84 --> 608.18]  And when we say it's a revelation,
[608.38 --> 609.04]  or it's apocalypse,
[609.22 --> 611.90]  we mean this is a book of heavenly visions.
[612.90 --> 615.72]  And a key to seeing this book is John saying,
[616.26 --> 618.42]  I looked and I saw.
[619.20 --> 620.44]  This is not someone saying,
[620.64 --> 621.64]  at this date in the future,
[621.64 --> 622.26]  this is happening,
[622.38 --> 623.46]  then at this date in the future,
[623.56 --> 624.06]  this is happening,
[624.16 --> 625.06]  and then at this date,
[625.14 --> 625.68]  this is happening.
[626.06 --> 627.40]  It's John having visions,
[627.54 --> 628.48]  some of them about the future,
[628.86 --> 630.20]  some are all sorts of images
[630.20 --> 631.72]  and visuals of the past
[631.72 --> 632.88]  from biblical imagery.
[633.36 --> 634.82]  You'll see the book of Daniel quoted,
[634.92 --> 636.02]  the book of Zephaniah quoted.
[636.28 --> 637.74]  There's a lot of allusions and images
[637.74 --> 639.36]  that would speak to the people then
[639.36 --> 640.66]  about what is coming
[640.66 --> 642.22]  and what has already happened.
[642.34 --> 643.38]  This is a revelation.
[643.84 --> 645.20]  It's important to read it as such.
[646.38 --> 646.84]  But secondly,
[647.60 --> 648.30]  it's a prophecy.
[649.04 --> 649.82]  We read at the beginning,
[649.82 --> 651.50]  blessed is the one who reads aloud,
[651.50 --> 653.32]  the words of this prophecy.
[654.32 --> 655.10]  And prophecy, of course,
[655.20 --> 656.60]  is concerned with the future.
[657.48 --> 658.48]  And people who read Revelation
[658.48 --> 659.96]  are often very concerned
[659.96 --> 661.24]  with how Revelation speaks
[661.24 --> 662.44]  about the future.
[662.72 --> 663.52]  And I happen to believe
[663.52 --> 664.90]  that much of what we read
[664.90 --> 665.38]  in Revelation
[665.38 --> 667.00]  has already been said
[667.00 --> 667.92]  in other books of the Bible.
[668.50 --> 669.48]  This is not some,
[669.82 --> 670.64]  in my opinion,
[670.82 --> 672.30]  this is not some coded book
[672.30 --> 673.44]  that we have to sort of decipher
[673.44 --> 674.10]  like a puzzle
[674.10 --> 675.42]  that's only about the future.
[676.22 --> 677.40]  Revelation stands squarely
[677.40 --> 678.28]  with the rest of Scripture,
[678.28 --> 679.88]  and a lot of it is already there
[679.88 --> 681.28]  in the rest of the biblical story.
[682.64 --> 683.44]  But we should know
[683.44 --> 684.16]  that prophecy
[684.16 --> 686.24]  is not just about the future.
[686.34 --> 688.00]  This is a really important point
[688.00 --> 688.68]  about Revelation.
[689.20 --> 690.10]  Prophecy in the Old Testament
[690.10 --> 690.76]  and in Revelation
[690.76 --> 692.24]  is a word about the future,
[692.56 --> 693.62]  God speaking to someone
[693.62 --> 694.32]  about the future,
[694.54 --> 695.76]  with an eye on how
[695.76 --> 697.02]  we should live in the present
[697.02 --> 698.46]  now that we know
[698.46 --> 699.04]  what's coming.
[699.70 --> 700.30]  All the prophecy
[700.30 --> 700.74]  in the Old Testament,
[700.86 --> 701.52]  the aim is
[701.52 --> 702.68]  that the people living
[702.68 --> 703.12]  in the present
[703.12 --> 704.38]  would live in response
[704.38 --> 705.64]  faithfully and obedient
[705.64 --> 707.10]  in light of what is coming.
[707.10 --> 709.18]  That's a really important part
[709.18 --> 709.92]  of prophecy.
[710.70 --> 711.46]  And I think it's somewhat,
[711.96 --> 712.88]  we can do cruelty
[712.88 --> 713.76]  almost to the book,
[714.08 --> 714.96]  when we see it only
[714.96 --> 715.88]  as a book about the future
[715.88 --> 716.54]  that's disconnected
[716.54 --> 717.52]  from the people,
[718.28 --> 719.14]  that John is actually
[719.14 --> 720.04]  writing this book too.
[720.56 --> 721.84]  That brings me to the third thing
[721.84 --> 722.74]  that Revelation is.
[722.82 --> 723.94]  It is a letter.
[724.06 --> 724.70]  Did you hear that?
[725.02 --> 725.44]  He says,
[725.52 --> 726.26]  grace and peace
[726.26 --> 726.98]  to the churches.
[727.54 --> 728.70]  And Jesus says to John,
[728.86 --> 730.52]  write this to the churches.
[731.12 --> 732.50]  This is an actual letter
[732.50 --> 733.80]  written to actual churches
[733.80 --> 734.66]  that is circulated.
[735.00 --> 735.80]  They believe that this book
[735.80 --> 736.68]  sort of went from church
[736.68 --> 737.44]  to church to church
[737.44 --> 738.18]  throughout Asia Minor
[738.18 --> 738.80]  and they read it.
[738.96 --> 739.96]  It was to them.
[740.48 --> 741.80]  It addressed very real people
[741.80 --> 743.06]  and very real circumstances
[743.06 --> 744.58]  with very real challenges
[744.58 --> 746.60]  and we need to read it as such.
[747.16 --> 748.34]  This is not just some coded
[748.34 --> 749.14]  book about the future.
[749.42 --> 750.56]  This is about real churches
[750.56 --> 751.72]  facing real challenges
[751.72 --> 752.76]  in Asia Minor.
[753.84 --> 755.08]  And as we go through this series,
[755.44 --> 756.06]  you're going to see
[756.06 --> 757.04]  how that is the case.
[760.96 --> 761.92]  I think it's important
[761.92 --> 762.84]  with this book of Revelation
[762.84 --> 763.66]  not just to ask
[763.66 --> 764.40]  what it's saying
[764.40 --> 766.16]  or to wrestle with
[766.16 --> 767.06]  the questions of genre
[767.06 --> 768.38]  but to ask the big question
[768.38 --> 771.08]  that Mike Goheen asked
[771.08 --> 772.10]  when he was teaching this class.
[772.34 --> 772.78]  He wondered,
[773.28 --> 774.38]  what is the book of Revelation
[774.38 --> 775.32]  as a whole
[775.32 --> 777.20]  trying to do?
[778.16 --> 779.08]  How is this book,
[779.16 --> 780.30]  as the churches receive it
[780.30 --> 780.68]  and read it,
[780.74 --> 782.50]  how is it trying to shape them
[782.50 --> 784.04]  in their context?
[784.18 --> 784.90]  And of course,
[784.98 --> 785.48]  by extension,
[785.84 --> 786.54]  us as well.
[786.90 --> 787.72]  I'm going to read a quote
[787.72 --> 788.76]  that Mike shared
[788.76 --> 789.34]  in that class
[789.34 --> 790.04]  he did over Zoom
[790.04 --> 790.76]  last spring.
[791.28 --> 792.32]  It's crazy to think that.
[792.32 --> 793.84]  We were over Zoom then
[793.84 --> 794.92]  and we're still online now.
[795.00 --> 796.02]  But this is what Mike shared
[796.02 --> 797.38]  about what the book of Revelation
[797.38 --> 798.72]  is trying to do.
[798.82 --> 799.38]  I believe the quote
[799.38 --> 800.38]  will be on the screen there.
[801.02 --> 801.42]  He writes,
[801.74 --> 802.98]  Revelation is
[802.98 --> 804.82]  unmasking
[804.82 --> 806.76]  the false narrative world
[806.76 --> 807.94]  of the idolatrous
[807.94 --> 808.74]  Roman Empire.
[808.88 --> 809.52]  So it's tearing down
[809.52 --> 810.20]  the lies
[810.20 --> 811.44]  of the Roman Empire
[811.44 --> 813.18]  and telling the true story,
[813.62 --> 814.64]  the biblical story,
[814.96 --> 816.90]  to equip God's people
[816.90 --> 818.20]  for faithfulness
[818.20 --> 820.54]  and costly witness
[820.54 --> 822.12]  as they align themselves
[822.12 --> 822.78]  with God
[822.78 --> 823.70]  and Christ
[823.70 --> 824.82]  in the end-time
[824.82 --> 825.74]  spiritual battle.
[826.82 --> 827.60]  Now, there's a lot
[827.60 --> 828.22]  in that statement
[828.22 --> 829.34]  that I want to just highlight.
[829.46 --> 830.36]  I'll just briefly highlight
[830.36 --> 832.02]  how it's tearing down
[832.02 --> 832.98]  the lies that the culture
[832.98 --> 833.64]  is propping up
[833.64 --> 835.08]  about what is reality
[835.08 --> 836.56]  and it's in a very creative,
[836.72 --> 837.10]  powerful,
[837.28 --> 838.12]  visionary kind of way
[838.12 --> 838.84]  retelling
[838.84 --> 839.80]  and sharing
[839.80 --> 840.96]  what the true story
[840.96 --> 842.16]  of the scripture is
[842.16 --> 843.44]  fulfilled in Jesus.
[844.08 --> 845.40]  And it's inviting the church,
[845.68 --> 846.88]  this tiny church.
[846.96 --> 847.32]  And remember,
[848.18 --> 849.22]  my hunch is
[849.22 --> 850.06]  that all the churches
[850.06 --> 850.88]  in Asia Minor
[850.88 --> 852.10]  put together
[852.10 --> 853.40]  are probably smaller
[853.40 --> 854.14]  than our church.
[854.76 --> 855.92]  These are small house churches
[855.92 --> 856.58]  in Asia Minor.
[856.70 --> 857.26]  Picture that.
[857.94 --> 858.94]  These little house churches
[858.94 --> 860.40]  are told to stay faithful
[860.40 --> 861.04]  to Jesus
[861.04 --> 863.02]  and be willing
[863.02 --> 863.84]  to suffer
[863.84 --> 865.28]  for the conviction
[865.28 --> 866.22]  that Jesus is Lord
[866.22 --> 867.26]  over and against
[867.26 --> 868.82]  this big Roman story.
[870.00 --> 871.30]  And recognizing
[871.30 --> 872.14]  that there is
[872.14 --> 873.02]  at this very moment
[873.02 --> 873.60]  from the time
[873.60 --> 874.46]  of Jesus' resurrection
[874.46 --> 875.30]  to his return
[875.30 --> 876.36]  a end-time
[876.36 --> 877.18]  spiritual battle.
[877.38 --> 877.94]  There's more
[877.94 --> 879.00]  than the eyes see.
[879.22 --> 880.28]  in our world.
[880.92 --> 881.36]  And I say this
[881.36 --> 882.26]  specifically to our
[882.26 --> 883.70]  sort of materialistic
[883.70 --> 884.32]  in the sense of
[884.32 --> 885.04]  we only believe
[885.04 --> 885.86]  what we see with our eyes.
[885.92 --> 886.76]  There's more going on
[886.76 --> 887.32]  in our world
[887.32 --> 888.44]  than what we see.
[889.40 --> 890.48]  Or as A.W. Tozer
[890.48 --> 891.34]  put it really well,
[892.06 --> 893.12]  we often think of this world
[893.12 --> 893.70]  as a playground
[893.70 --> 895.52]  when it is in fact
[895.52 --> 896.84]  a battleground
[896.84 --> 898.08]  between the powers
[898.08 --> 899.02]  and the principalities
[899.02 --> 899.92]  and Jesus Christ,
[900.26 --> 900.98]  the rightful Lord
[900.98 --> 901.76]  of all creation.
[901.76 --> 906.02]  the whole book
[906.02 --> 907.38]  in all of its
[907.38 --> 908.54]  various genres
[908.54 --> 909.54]  and the way it's written
[909.54 --> 911.74]  is trying to encourage
[911.74 --> 913.48]  and equip
[913.48 --> 914.42]  these little churches
[914.42 --> 915.96]  to stay faithful
[915.96 --> 916.50]  to Jesus
[916.50 --> 917.78]  as Lord.
[918.48 --> 919.46]  To stay faithful
[919.46 --> 920.08]  to the fact that
[920.08 --> 921.56]  Jesus is the exalted King.
[921.66 --> 922.12]  And one of the things
[922.12 --> 923.28]  I love about Revelation,
[923.46 --> 925.12]  you cannot read Revelation
[925.12 --> 926.94]  without having your view
[926.94 --> 927.42]  of Jesus
[927.42 --> 928.52]  just expanded
[928.52 --> 929.46]  like crazy.
[930.06 --> 930.96]  Revelation gives you
[930.96 --> 932.68]  a Jesus who is powerful,
[932.86 --> 933.94]  who has all authority.
[934.22 --> 935.26]  All the kings of the earth
[935.26 --> 936.60]  put their crowns down
[936.60 --> 937.28]  before Jesus,
[937.40 --> 938.58]  the slain lamb
[938.58 --> 940.14]  who defeated Satan
[940.14 --> 941.10]  through the cross.
[941.46 --> 942.54]  You can't read Revelation
[942.54 --> 943.66]  without having your vision
[943.66 --> 944.14]  of Jesus
[944.14 --> 945.88]  completely expanded.
[946.18 --> 947.00]  And I hope that happens
[947.00 --> 947.98]  for all of us.
[948.40 --> 949.46]  I think in all sorts of ways
[949.46 --> 950.38]  we domesticate
[950.38 --> 951.48]  and we reduce Jesus
[951.48 --> 952.52]  to something so much
[952.52 --> 953.34]  smaller than He is.
[953.62 --> 954.50]  And you read Revelation
[954.50 --> 956.24]  and He is the King of Kings.
[956.98 --> 958.12]  He is the Lord of Lords.
[958.20 --> 959.28]  And even in our passage,
[959.46 --> 960.54]  He talks about Jesus
[960.54 --> 961.68]  as the faithful witness,
[961.80 --> 963.08]  the firstborn of the dead,
[963.28 --> 964.72]  the ruler of the kings
[964.72 --> 965.28]  of the earth,
[965.44 --> 966.58]  the first and the last,
[966.68 --> 967.80]  the Alpha and the Omega.
[968.16 --> 969.38]  This is Jesus Christ.
[970.54 --> 971.32]  And Revelation says
[971.32 --> 972.96]  stay faithful to Him.
[973.80 --> 974.78]  He is the true King.
[975.78 --> 977.06]  Rome won't tell you this story,
[977.06 --> 978.56]  but this is the true story.
[980.08 --> 981.82]  Now the letters we're working on,
[982.60 --> 983.58]  we're working through,
[984.06 --> 986.32]  are letters that Jesus tells John
[986.32 --> 987.90]  to write to the churches
[987.90 --> 989.50]  because Jesus Himself
[989.50 --> 990.80]  has something to say
[990.80 --> 991.28]  to these churches.
[991.40 --> 992.66]  I find this is a very important point.
[992.74 --> 993.48]  If you have your Bible,
[993.60 --> 994.00]  you'll see,
[994.32 --> 995.48]  if you look at Revelation 2,
[995.62 --> 997.60]  the color of the Bible is red.
[998.40 --> 1000.08]  This is Jesus' revelation
[1000.08 --> 1001.42]  to the churches.
[1002.22 --> 1002.82]  He says to John,
[1002.90 --> 1003.50]  write this down.
[1003.56 --> 1004.38]  I have a word
[1004.38 --> 1005.54]  for each of these churches
[1005.54 --> 1006.36]  in Asia Minor.
[1006.90 --> 1007.90]  It's very powerful
[1007.90 --> 1008.72]  to think of Jesus
[1008.72 --> 1010.64]  as described in Revelation 1,
[1010.98 --> 1013.04]  walking among His churches.
[1013.04 --> 1015.46]  Jesus is walking
[1015.46 --> 1016.44]  among the candlesticks,
[1016.52 --> 1018.12]  which are the seven churches.
[1018.78 --> 1019.44]  And we realize
[1019.44 --> 1020.32]  as we read these,
[1020.36 --> 1021.48]  and you'll see this week after week,
[1021.96 --> 1023.10]  He knows them.
[1023.92 --> 1024.96]  He knows their strengths.
[1025.08 --> 1025.78]  He knows their weaknesses.
[1025.98 --> 1027.12]  He knows what they're struggling with.
[1027.18 --> 1028.40]  He knows where all the stuff
[1028.40 --> 1028.98]  is going on.
[1028.98 --> 1030.60]  And He has words of encouragement,
[1031.70 --> 1032.84]  words of challenge,
[1033.56 --> 1034.62]  words of invitation,
[1035.50 --> 1036.54]  words of warning.
[1037.12 --> 1038.40]  He wants His churches
[1038.40 --> 1039.82]  to hear from Him.
[1040.70 --> 1041.92]  And we as the church today
[1041.92 --> 1042.98]  are going to listen in
[1042.98 --> 1044.34]  on what Jesus says
[1044.34 --> 1044.84]  to His church
[1044.84 --> 1045.84]  and through the church then
[1045.84 --> 1046.98]  to the church today.
[1049.10 --> 1049.86]  But this morning,
[1049.92 --> 1050.86]  I want to spend a few minutes
[1050.86 --> 1051.72]  opening up the context.
[1051.94 --> 1052.22]  In fact,
[1052.52 --> 1053.80]  I was originally going to jump
[1053.80 --> 1055.04]  right into the church of Ephesus,
[1055.32 --> 1056.30]  which is next week,
[1056.64 --> 1057.98]  but I just couldn't jump
[1057.98 --> 1058.84]  over the context.
[1059.00 --> 1060.62]  And I want us not to be reading this
[1060.62 --> 1062.20]  only thinking about our context,
[1062.32 --> 1063.62]  but I want us to really be able
[1063.62 --> 1064.42]  to imagine
[1064.42 --> 1066.00]  what these churches
[1066.00 --> 1067.30]  in Asia Minor
[1067.30 --> 1068.62]  in the first century
[1068.62 --> 1069.64]  are experiencing.
[1069.82 --> 1071.44]  It's not what we are experiencing.
[1071.58 --> 1072.98]  We need to feel what they felt.
[1073.10 --> 1074.04]  And that's kind of my goal
[1074.04 --> 1074.86]  in the next couple minutes,
[1074.96 --> 1077.16]  to feel what they felt
[1077.16 --> 1078.28]  in these churches.
[1078.44 --> 1079.76]  So here's what's going on.
[1080.26 --> 1081.50]  John, who's, you know,
[1081.56 --> 1082.24]  he was exiled
[1082.24 --> 1083.36]  to the island of Patmos,
[1083.60 --> 1084.26]  had this vision,
[1084.40 --> 1085.04]  wrote about it later.
[1085.94 --> 1087.08]  John himself lived through
[1087.08 --> 1088.36]  very turbulent times
[1088.36 --> 1089.12]  in the Roman Empire.
[1090.20 --> 1091.18]  John was around
[1091.18 --> 1092.44]  when the Emperor Nero
[1092.44 --> 1093.44]  in 64 AD
[1093.44 --> 1095.02]  became the Emperor of Rome.
[1095.74 --> 1096.52]  And I think all of us
[1096.52 --> 1097.48]  know a little bit about Nero,
[1097.60 --> 1098.28]  enough to know that
[1098.28 --> 1099.74]  he really disliked Christians.
[1100.58 --> 1101.30]  Nero blamed them
[1101.30 --> 1102.16]  for things that went wrong
[1102.16 --> 1102.58]  in the city.
[1102.66 --> 1103.96]  He had the most cruel practices
[1103.96 --> 1104.72]  for killing them.
[1105.18 --> 1105.94]  In fact, I believe
[1105.94 --> 1107.14]  I have this quote as well.
[1107.54 --> 1108.62]  This is what one historian,
[1108.78 --> 1110.16]  Tacitus, said about Nero.
[1110.28 --> 1110.62]  He said,
[1111.36 --> 1112.98]  He, covered with the skins
[1112.98 --> 1113.48]  of beasts,
[1113.90 --> 1114.84]  the Christians were torn
[1114.84 --> 1115.68]  by dogs
[1115.68 --> 1116.56]  and perished.
[1117.28 --> 1118.82]  Or they were nailed to crosses.
[1119.48 --> 1120.32]  Or were doomed
[1120.32 --> 1121.04]  to the flames
[1121.04 --> 1121.62]  and burnt
[1121.62 --> 1122.60]  to serve
[1122.60 --> 1124.20]  as nightly illumination.
[1124.20 --> 1127.66]  I just want us to pause there
[1127.66 --> 1128.80]  and take that in.
[1129.26 --> 1129.72]  I don't want you
[1129.72 --> 1130.82]  to race past that quote.
[1132.00 --> 1133.32]  John and many
[1133.32 --> 1134.10]  of the Christians,
[1134.62 --> 1135.78]  the leaders of the church,
[1136.36 --> 1137.72]  lived under that kind of ruler.
[1138.96 --> 1140.22]  They lost family members,
[1140.88 --> 1141.78]  they lost friends,
[1142.32 --> 1142.68]  children,
[1143.12 --> 1143.90]  and parents
[1143.90 --> 1145.38]  because they believed
[1145.38 --> 1146.32]  that Jesus was Lord.
[1146.32 --> 1149.58]  And, as one writer said,
[1149.82 --> 1150.78]  there would be many believers,
[1150.96 --> 1151.68]  even at the time
[1151.68 --> 1152.46]  of this writing,
[1153.12 --> 1154.42]  who may be young adults,
[1154.68 --> 1155.50]  about the same age
[1155.50 --> 1156.34]  as Misha who's here,
[1156.68 --> 1158.16]  they never knew peace.
[1158.86 --> 1159.98]  They never knew a time
[1159.98 --> 1160.84]  where the church could do
[1160.84 --> 1161.64]  what we're even doing
[1161.64 --> 1162.20]  this morning.
[1162.84 --> 1163.58]  They never knew
[1163.58 --> 1164.32]  what it would be like
[1164.32 --> 1165.86]  to safely gather
[1165.86 --> 1167.36]  and worship Jesus as Lord.
[1168.00 --> 1169.30]  They would have lost loved ones.
[1169.40 --> 1170.70]  They would have been
[1170.70 --> 1171.86]  socialized
[1171.86 --> 1173.04]  into living their faith
[1173.04 --> 1173.76]  on the run
[1173.76 --> 1176.44]  for the sake of their safety.
[1176.82 --> 1177.68]  Can you imagine that?
[1177.72 --> 1178.44]  Just try to live
[1178.44 --> 1179.70]  in that space for a moment.
[1180.08 --> 1181.00]  This is very important
[1181.00 --> 1181.60]  for understanding
[1181.60 --> 1182.36]  the book of Revelation.
[1182.84 --> 1183.90]  This is a serious book
[1183.90 --> 1185.52]  written for serious times.
[1186.78 --> 1187.38]  In the time
[1187.38 --> 1188.46]  that this was going on,
[1189.12 --> 1189.82]  Peter and Paul
[1189.82 --> 1190.40]  were crucified,
[1190.70 --> 1191.80]  Timothy was murdered,
[1192.00 --> 1192.54]  many Christians
[1192.54 --> 1193.32]  would scatter
[1193.32 --> 1193.98]  and they fled.
[1194.66 --> 1196.00]  And then came another ruler
[1196.00 --> 1196.84]  whose name was Domitian.
[1197.12 --> 1198.26]  And most scholars agree
[1198.26 --> 1198.96]  that at the time
[1198.96 --> 1199.96]  of Revelation's writing,
[1200.12 --> 1201.40]  Domitian was the emperor.
[1202.26 --> 1203.34]  And there's a lot of debate
[1203.34 --> 1204.92]  about how much
[1204.92 --> 1205.98]  Domitian persecuted
[1205.98 --> 1206.48]  the church.
[1206.70 --> 1207.38]  Some say a ton,
[1207.48 --> 1208.58]  some say less than we think.
[1208.86 --> 1209.88]  We know he was hostile,
[1210.02 --> 1210.78]  we know Christians died
[1210.78 --> 1211.42]  under his rule,
[1211.50 --> 1212.00]  but there's debate
[1212.00 --> 1212.68]  about how much.
[1213.06 --> 1213.98]  What Domitian did
[1213.98 --> 1214.64]  was make life
[1214.64 --> 1215.34]  very difficult
[1215.34 --> 1216.08]  for Christians
[1216.08 --> 1217.66]  in a different way.
[1218.40 --> 1219.26]  Not unlike
[1219.26 --> 1220.42]  previous emperors,
[1220.88 --> 1221.74]  Domitian had a very
[1221.74 --> 1222.46]  inflated sense
[1222.46 --> 1223.00]  of who he was.
[1223.08 --> 1223.68]  He had statues
[1223.68 --> 1224.66]  all over the empire
[1224.66 --> 1226.10]  with his big face on it
[1226.10 --> 1227.80]  and he saw himself
[1227.80 --> 1229.56]  as a god.
[1230.26 --> 1230.60]  In fact,
[1230.64 --> 1231.36]  he changed his name
[1231.36 --> 1231.76]  in Greek
[1231.76 --> 1232.26]  to mean
[1232.26 --> 1233.56]  the eternal king.
[1233.64 --> 1234.32]  He saw Rome
[1234.32 --> 1234.84]  as sort of this
[1234.84 --> 1235.88]  incredible kingdom.
[1236.04 --> 1237.26]  He saw this established
[1237.26 --> 1238.42]  as like his work
[1238.42 --> 1240.00]  as a god-like figure.
[1240.74 --> 1241.76]  And more than that,
[1242.22 --> 1243.20]  he went to the next level
[1243.20 --> 1243.74]  where he actually
[1243.74 --> 1244.70]  had a temple built
[1244.70 --> 1245.86]  where people would go
[1245.86 --> 1246.34]  to that temple
[1246.34 --> 1247.00]  and they'd worship
[1247.00 --> 1248.38]  him.
[1249.98 --> 1250.96]  And he would invite
[1250.96 --> 1251.60]  and command
[1251.60 --> 1252.64]  all people
[1252.64 --> 1252.96]  who would go
[1252.96 --> 1253.50]  into the temple,
[1253.62 --> 1254.38]  grab some incense,
[1254.60 --> 1255.34]  burn the incense,
[1255.50 --> 1256.34]  and worship him
[1256.34 --> 1257.54]  as a lord
[1257.54 --> 1258.54]  and a god.
[1258.54 --> 1260.34]  Can you imagine
[1260.34 --> 1260.66]  that?
[1261.68 --> 1262.20]  Can you imagine
[1262.20 --> 1263.02]  living in a time
[1263.02 --> 1263.72]  where the ruler
[1263.72 --> 1264.42]  in place
[1264.42 --> 1265.14]  of your city
[1265.14 --> 1265.98]  says your job
[1265.98 --> 1266.86]  is to go to the temple,
[1267.08 --> 1267.86]  you take incense,
[1267.96 --> 1268.46]  you burn it,
[1268.60 --> 1269.56]  and you worship
[1269.56 --> 1270.86]  your emperor
[1270.86 --> 1272.90]  as lord and god.
[1274.82 --> 1276.02]  That put Christians
[1276.02 --> 1277.08]  in a really
[1277.08 --> 1278.78]  tough place.
[1279.94 --> 1281.00]  What do you do
[1281.00 --> 1282.72]  when that's now
[1282.72 --> 1283.20]  the law?
[1284.08 --> 1284.72]  And it's important
[1284.72 --> 1285.20]  to recognize
[1285.20 --> 1285.94]  that none of these
[1285.94 --> 1286.96]  churches in Asia Minor
[1286.96 --> 1287.66]  were living sort of
[1287.66 --> 1288.34]  out in the country
[1288.34 --> 1288.74]  where they could
[1288.74 --> 1289.12]  just kind of
[1289.12 --> 1289.84]  do what they want.
[1290.30 --> 1290.54]  I mean,
[1290.68 --> 1291.94]  there's been jokes
[1291.94 --> 1292.38]  about even with
[1292.38 --> 1292.86]  the pandemic
[1292.86 --> 1293.38]  that if you live
[1293.38 --> 1293.70]  in the city
[1293.70 --> 1293.90]  you've got to
[1293.90 --> 1294.56]  be really careful
[1294.56 --> 1295.20]  that if you live
[1295.20 --> 1295.50]  in the country
[1295.50 --> 1296.00]  you can kind of
[1296.00 --> 1296.54]  worship and no
[1296.54 --> 1296.94]  one will know.
[1297.48 --> 1298.18]  These churches
[1298.18 --> 1298.98]  lived in the middle
[1298.98 --> 1299.64]  of the cities.
[1300.06 --> 1300.72]  People would know
[1300.72 --> 1301.28]  if they worship
[1301.28 --> 1301.84]  in the temple
[1301.84 --> 1303.38]  and honor Domitian
[1303.38 --> 1303.80]  as a god.
[1303.88 --> 1304.38]  They would know
[1304.38 --> 1305.20]  if they're not there.
[1305.52 --> 1306.70]  This is public stuff.
[1306.96 --> 1307.54]  There's a lot
[1307.54 --> 1308.32]  on the line.
[1308.72 --> 1309.30]  And this is a
[1309.30 --> 1310.58]  pressure cooker
[1310.58 --> 1311.58]  situation
[1311.58 --> 1312.88]  where Christians
[1312.88 --> 1313.32]  have to make
[1313.32 --> 1314.56]  very hard decisions
[1314.56 --> 1315.78]  about what will
[1315.78 --> 1316.34]  they do
[1316.34 --> 1317.98]  when it's time
[1317.98 --> 1318.42]  in the day
[1318.42 --> 1319.02]  to worship
[1319.02 --> 1319.84]  your emperor
[1319.84 --> 1321.06]  as lord and god
[1321.06 --> 1322.00]  and go to the temple
[1322.00 --> 1322.90]  throw your incense
[1322.90 --> 1323.64]  and worship him.
[1324.02 --> 1324.78]  What are they to do?
[1326.06 --> 1327.30]  What would you do
[1327.30 --> 1328.90]  in that moment?
[1330.28 --> 1331.24]  What decisions
[1331.24 --> 1332.12]  would you make?
[1332.12 --> 1336.20]  I can imagine
[1336.20 --> 1337.54]  all the challenges
[1337.54 --> 1338.48]  that come with that.
[1339.38 --> 1340.16]  I can imagine
[1340.16 --> 1341.48]  the excuses
[1341.48 --> 1342.76]  Christians could make
[1342.76 --> 1344.00]  that I would be
[1344.00 --> 1344.70]  prone to make.
[1345.06 --> 1345.74]  Well maybe I'll go
[1345.74 --> 1346.20]  to the temple
[1346.20 --> 1346.90]  and I'll murmur
[1346.90 --> 1347.36]  the worship
[1347.36 --> 1348.24]  and I'll say the words
[1348.24 --> 1349.08]  and I'll throw the incense
[1349.08 --> 1349.64]  but I know
[1349.64 --> 1350.76]  God knows I don't mean it.
[1351.90 --> 1352.58]  Or maybe I'll just
[1352.58 --> 1353.62]  go along with all
[1353.62 --> 1354.30]  that's happening
[1354.30 --> 1355.60]  because I don't
[1355.60 --> 1356.14]  want to be killed.
[1356.26 --> 1356.74]  I've got a family
[1356.74 --> 1357.52]  to take care of.
[1357.92 --> 1358.66]  I've got a job
[1358.66 --> 1359.48]  to take care of.
[1359.80 --> 1360.54]  I don't want to lose
[1360.54 --> 1361.18]  my position
[1361.18 --> 1361.96]  and my respect
[1361.96 --> 1362.66]  in the city.
[1363.06 --> 1363.76]  There's all sorts
[1363.76 --> 1364.16]  of pressure
[1364.16 --> 1365.00]  I could imagine
[1365.00 --> 1365.40]  them saying
[1365.40 --> 1366.10]  you know what
[1366.10 --> 1367.18]  it's not worth it
[1367.18 --> 1368.26]  to talk about
[1368.26 --> 1369.08]  Jesus as lord.
[1369.54 --> 1370.22]  It's too dangerous.
[1370.36 --> 1371.12]  It's not worth it
[1371.12 --> 1371.64]  telling people
[1371.64 --> 1372.46]  what we really believe
[1372.46 --> 1372.82]  as Christians.
[1372.94 --> 1373.92]  Let's just dial it down
[1373.92 --> 1374.92]  privatize it
[1374.92 --> 1375.70]  go through the motions
[1375.70 --> 1376.94]  and stay safe.
[1377.86 --> 1378.98]  The buzzword
[1378.98 --> 1380.10]  of Canada right now
[1380.10 --> 1381.62]  stay safe.
[1382.24 --> 1383.12]  Imagine the pressure
[1383.12 --> 1383.74]  they had
[1383.74 --> 1384.86]  to be safe
[1384.86 --> 1385.80]  in this context.
[1388.04 --> 1389.00]  It's important to know
[1389.00 --> 1389.66]  that the churches
[1389.66 --> 1390.30]  of Revelation
[1390.30 --> 1392.24]  they all responded
[1392.24 --> 1393.04]  to this pressure
[1393.04 --> 1393.88]  in different ways.
[1395.00 --> 1395.76]  Some churches
[1395.76 --> 1397.70]  they stood firm
[1397.70 --> 1399.20]  saying to the
[1399.20 --> 1399.82]  emperor
[1399.82 --> 1401.50]  Jesus is lord
[1401.50 --> 1403.36]  and they suffered.
[1404.48 --> 1405.44]  There are other churches
[1405.44 --> 1406.08]  we're going to read
[1406.08 --> 1406.50]  about them
[1406.50 --> 1406.90]  they're like
[1406.90 --> 1407.46]  you know what
[1407.46 --> 1408.92]  if we just keep it
[1408.92 --> 1409.60]  cool here
[1409.60 --> 1410.68]  we're going to benefit
[1410.68 --> 1411.32]  from the wealth
[1411.32 --> 1411.92]  of the empire.
[1412.08 --> 1412.70]  We're going to benefit
[1412.70 --> 1413.34]  from the wealth
[1413.34 --> 1413.82]  of our city.
[1413.94 --> 1414.40]  We're going to be able
[1414.40 --> 1415.44]  to live a good life
[1415.44 --> 1416.46]  do our thing as Christians
[1416.46 --> 1417.30]  as long as we just
[1417.30 --> 1417.90]  keep it private
[1417.90 --> 1419.82]  we can get through this.
[1420.30 --> 1421.20]  And you're going to see
[1421.20 --> 1421.92]  the different churches
[1421.92 --> 1423.18]  responding in different ways
[1423.18 --> 1424.28]  to this high pressure
[1424.28 --> 1424.96]  persecution
[1424.96 --> 1426.34]  in their culture.
[1428.64 --> 1430.20]  Laodicea was a wealthy church
[1430.20 --> 1431.80]  in this context.
[1432.76 --> 1433.12]  Smyrna
[1433.12 --> 1435.04]  was a persecuted church
[1435.04 --> 1436.18]  in this context.
[1436.30 --> 1436.84]  And I often wonder
[1436.84 --> 1437.50]  how do these churches
[1437.50 --> 1438.74]  relate to one another
[1438.74 --> 1440.18]  knowing how differently
[1440.18 --> 1440.94]  they're responding
[1440.94 --> 1441.96]  to the challenges
[1441.96 --> 1442.74]  before them.
[1443.14 --> 1443.78]  And Jesus
[1443.78 --> 1444.52]  this is important
[1444.52 --> 1445.86]  he has a specific word
[1445.86 --> 1447.18]  for all of them
[1447.18 --> 1448.76]  as they respond
[1448.76 --> 1449.24]  differently
[1449.24 --> 1450.74]  to their context.
[1452.10 --> 1453.10]  In his class again
[1453.10 --> 1454.34]  that we had last spring
[1454.34 --> 1454.94]  Mike said
[1454.94 --> 1455.96]  Mike Ohene
[1455.96 --> 1456.18]  he said
[1456.18 --> 1456.84]  some of these churches
[1456.84 --> 1457.38]  were rich
[1457.38 --> 1458.92]  some were poor
[1458.92 --> 1460.62]  some were apathetic
[1460.62 --> 1461.56]  to the circumstances
[1461.56 --> 1462.06]  around them
[1462.06 --> 1463.24]  and others were persecuted
[1463.24 --> 1465.00]  some were faithful
[1465.00 --> 1467.30]  some were deeply compromised
[1467.30 --> 1469.14]  some were weak
[1469.14 --> 1470.76]  some were strong
[1470.76 --> 1471.86]  some benefited
[1471.86 --> 1472.76]  off the wealth
[1472.76 --> 1473.50]  of the country
[1473.50 --> 1474.56]  that was going on
[1474.56 --> 1475.48]  and some
[1475.48 --> 1476.84]  were hounded down
[1476.84 --> 1477.54]  by it.
[1479.10 --> 1479.58]  And Jesus
[1479.58 --> 1480.32]  has a word
[1480.32 --> 1481.26]  to all of them.
[1482.66 --> 1483.32]  He speaks
[1483.32 --> 1484.70]  directly to them.
[1485.36 --> 1486.06]  I know
[1486.06 --> 1487.46]  your deeds.
[1487.56 --> 1488.06]  He says that
[1488.06 --> 1489.08]  in almost every letter
[1489.08 --> 1489.50]  to the church.
[1489.62 --> 1490.38]  I know
[1490.38 --> 1491.90]  your deeds.
[1492.50 --> 1493.02]  And he often
[1493.02 --> 1494.34]  encourages the faithfulness
[1494.34 --> 1495.22]  he encourages
[1495.22 --> 1495.72]  the areas
[1495.72 --> 1496.68]  where the life of Jesus
[1496.68 --> 1497.42]  is taking root
[1497.42 --> 1497.92]  in the community
[1497.92 --> 1499.38]  and he warns them.
[1500.12 --> 1500.84]  He calls them
[1500.84 --> 1501.44]  to repentance
[1501.44 --> 1502.54]  he calls them
[1502.54 --> 1503.22]  to faithfulness
[1503.22 --> 1503.68]  and he speaks
[1503.68 --> 1504.54]  exactly what
[1504.54 --> 1505.70]  they need to hear
[1505.70 --> 1506.82]  in their part
[1506.82 --> 1507.62]  of the Roman Empire
[1507.62 --> 1508.58]  as the body
[1508.58 --> 1509.14]  of Christ.
[1509.94 --> 1510.60]  And all of it
[1510.60 --> 1511.36]  Jesus says
[1511.36 --> 1513.02]  because he loves
[1513.02 --> 1513.62]  his church.
[1514.94 --> 1515.72]  And I hope
[1515.72 --> 1516.30]  every letter
[1516.30 --> 1516.86]  we go through
[1516.86 --> 1517.94]  you hear the words
[1517.94 --> 1519.42]  of the very Jesus
[1519.42 --> 1520.64]  who died
[1520.64 --> 1522.38]  for these churches.
[1523.40 --> 1524.18]  He's got skin
[1524.18 --> 1524.82]  in the game
[1524.82 --> 1526.08]  for what these churches
[1526.08 --> 1526.66]  are about
[1526.66 --> 1527.60]  what they're doing
[1527.60 --> 1528.36]  how they're living
[1528.36 --> 1528.96]  in the midst
[1528.96 --> 1530.44]  of this Roman world.
[1531.20 --> 1532.26]  I know your deeds.
[1532.26 --> 1533.08]  And you're going
[1533.08 --> 1533.86]  to see he challenges
[1533.86 --> 1534.86]  encourages
[1534.86 --> 1536.00]  promises
[1536.00 --> 1536.78]  blessing
[1536.78 --> 1537.74]  encourages faithfulness
[1537.74 --> 1538.68]  and he gives them
[1538.68 --> 1539.58]  hope.
[1542.30 --> 1543.08]  And I just want
[1543.08 --> 1543.72]  to say to us
[1543.72 --> 1544.22]  as we move
[1544.22 --> 1544.92]  through this series
[1544.92 --> 1546.38]  we need to listen
[1546.38 --> 1547.48]  well to all of them.
[1548.40 --> 1548.60]  You know
[1548.60 --> 1549.94]  often in western churches
[1549.94 --> 1550.88]  we'll gravitate
[1550.88 --> 1551.46]  to say
[1551.46 --> 1552.12]  churches like
[1552.12 --> 1552.90]  Laodicea
[1552.90 --> 1553.40]  or Ephesus
[1553.40 --> 1553.88]  those are going
[1553.88 --> 1554.20]  to be ones
[1554.20 --> 1554.42]  where we're like
[1554.42 --> 1554.90]  yeah that's more
[1554.90 --> 1555.54]  like our context
[1555.54 --> 1556.10]  but I want us
[1556.10 --> 1556.90]  to listen carefully
[1556.90 --> 1557.76]  to all of them.
[1557.76 --> 1559.36]  asking ourselves
[1559.36 --> 1559.78]  the question
[1559.78 --> 1560.96]  what is the spirit
[1560.96 --> 1561.58]  of Christ
[1561.58 --> 1562.44]  saying to us
[1562.44 --> 1563.86]  today at Hope Community Church
[1563.86 --> 1565.28]  as we hear
[1565.28 --> 1566.32]  Jesus' instruction
[1566.32 --> 1567.52]  to Smyrna
[1567.52 --> 1568.72]  and Pergamum
[1568.72 --> 1570.18]  to Ephesus
[1570.18 --> 1571.22]  and Laodicea
[1571.22 --> 1572.18]  what is he saying
[1572.18 --> 1572.74]  to us
[1572.74 --> 1573.88]  and I'm just going
[1573.88 --> 1574.70]  to throw this out there
[1574.70 --> 1575.32]  for those of us
[1575.32 --> 1576.18]  who want to do it
[1576.18 --> 1578.20]  I think it might not
[1578.20 --> 1579.06]  be a bad idea
[1579.06 --> 1580.06]  to think about
[1580.06 --> 1580.94]  writing a letter
[1580.94 --> 1581.98]  that Jesus might
[1581.98 --> 1583.12]  give to us
[1583.12 --> 1583.86]  as a church
[1583.86 --> 1584.96]  after all these
[1584.96 --> 1585.48]  seven letters
[1585.48 --> 1586.08]  we go through them
[1586.08 --> 1587.48]  perhaps you could write it
[1587.48 --> 1588.62]  what you think it is
[1588.62 --> 1590.30]  that we need to hear
[1590.30 --> 1590.98]  and I know there's
[1590.98 --> 1591.60]  some creatives
[1591.60 --> 1592.08]  in our midst
[1592.08 --> 1592.68]  there's some of you
[1592.68 --> 1593.48]  who have emailed me
[1593.48 --> 1594.28]  your creative writing
[1594.28 --> 1595.08]  in previous seasons
[1595.08 --> 1596.66]  perhaps you should consider
[1596.66 --> 1597.62]  at the end of this series
[1597.62 --> 1598.54]  writing your own
[1598.54 --> 1601.04]  Dear Hope Community Church
[1601.04 --> 1602.36]  and we can have that
[1602.36 --> 1602.96]  as an exercise
[1602.96 --> 1604.26]  of how we live into
[1604.26 --> 1605.32]  and listen well
[1605.32 --> 1606.30]  to his word
[1606.30 --> 1606.78]  to the church
[1606.78 --> 1607.58]  in the first century
[1607.58 --> 1611.36]  this morning
[1611.36 --> 1612.22]  I want to just open up
[1612.22 --> 1613.82]  finally three things
[1613.82 --> 1615.08]  that thread their way
[1615.08 --> 1616.20]  through all of the letters
[1616.20 --> 1617.44]  you're going to see this
[1617.44 --> 1618.96]  come up over and over again
[1618.96 --> 1620.68]  the messages to the church
[1620.68 --> 1622.30]  are number one
[1622.30 --> 1625.54]  resist the lies
[1625.54 --> 1629.66]  resist the pressure
[1629.66 --> 1633.36]  do not compromise
[1633.36 --> 1635.00]  your conviction
[1635.00 --> 1636.92]  that Jesus is Lord
[1636.92 --> 1638.66]  I know you hear it
[1638.66 --> 1639.60]  day in day out
[1639.60 --> 1640.48]  what the mission is
[1640.48 --> 1640.92]  who he is
[1640.92 --> 1641.70]  who he thinks he is
[1641.70 --> 1644.26]  do not compromise
[1644.26 --> 1645.98]  what you know
[1645.98 --> 1646.68]  to be true
[1646.68 --> 1648.00]  because the tomb
[1648.00 --> 1648.62]  is empty
[1648.62 --> 1650.70]  you know I was struck
[1650.70 --> 1651.10]  this week
[1651.10 --> 1651.64]  and I was reading
[1651.64 --> 1652.92]  a number of commentaries
[1652.92 --> 1653.70]  my favorite being
[1653.70 --> 1654.50]  by Richard Bauckham
[1654.50 --> 1655.20]  if you want to read
[1655.20 --> 1656.16]  a great commentary
[1656.16 --> 1657.54]  pick up Richard Bauckham's
[1657.54 --> 1659.42]  and he talked about
[1659.42 --> 1660.40]  how we need to remember
[1660.40 --> 1661.02]  that the church
[1661.02 --> 1662.02]  doesn't resist Rome
[1662.02 --> 1662.80]  just because they're
[1662.80 --> 1663.56]  being persecuted
[1663.56 --> 1664.48]  there's much more
[1664.48 --> 1665.12]  going on
[1665.12 --> 1666.24]  and Richard Bauckham
[1666.24 --> 1666.66]  writes this
[1666.66 --> 1666.94]  he says
[1666.94 --> 1667.98]  it's not simply
[1667.98 --> 1668.78]  because Rome
[1668.78 --> 1670.20]  persecuted Christians
[1670.20 --> 1671.66]  that Christians
[1671.66 --> 1672.66]  must oppose Rome
[1672.66 --> 1674.48]  rather it's because
[1674.48 --> 1675.14]  Christians must
[1675.14 --> 1676.64]  disassociate themselves
[1676.64 --> 1677.34]  from the evil
[1677.34 --> 1678.38]  of the Roman system
[1678.38 --> 1679.70]  that they are
[1679.70 --> 1680.70]  likely to suffer
[1680.70 --> 1681.36]  did you capture
[1681.36 --> 1681.84]  the difference
[1681.84 --> 1683.86]  behind the resistance
[1683.86 --> 1684.78]  is a reality
[1684.78 --> 1685.92]  that from top to bottom
[1685.92 --> 1686.64]  the Roman Empire
[1686.64 --> 1687.58]  was built on violence
[1687.58 --> 1688.32]  corruption
[1688.32 --> 1689.06]  power
[1689.06 --> 1690.04]  all sorts of
[1690.04 --> 1690.70]  exploitation
[1690.70 --> 1692.12]  and sexual immorality
[1692.12 --> 1693.50]  and it's that stuff
[1693.50 --> 1694.56]  that John is saying
[1694.56 --> 1694.94]  to the church
[1694.94 --> 1696.56]  this isn't who you are
[1696.56 --> 1697.38]  this isn't your story
[1697.38 --> 1698.96]  you can't go along
[1698.96 --> 1699.76]  with this
[1699.76 --> 1702.02]  here's another quote
[1702.02 --> 1702.66]  I don't think I have
[1702.66 --> 1703.42]  this up on the screen
[1703.42 --> 1704.54]  this is by Howard Brook
[1704.54 --> 1706.52]  and I don't like this quote
[1706.52 --> 1707.36]  because it's just challenging
[1707.36 --> 1708.64]  he writes
[1708.64 --> 1709.62]  John did not write
[1709.62 --> 1710.36]  Revelation to
[1710.36 --> 1711.90]  manufacture a crisis
[1711.90 --> 1713.32]  for people complacent
[1713.32 --> 1714.32]  about the Empire
[1714.32 --> 1716.20]  their complacency
[1716.20 --> 1717.04]  about Rome
[1717.04 --> 1718.90]  was the crisis
[1718.90 --> 1720.96]  did you hear that
[1720.96 --> 1722.28]  their sort of
[1722.28 --> 1724.12]  willingness to go along
[1724.12 --> 1725.06]  with the Roman
[1725.06 --> 1725.76]  culture
[1725.76 --> 1726.60]  and the Roman story
[1726.60 --> 1727.98]  was the crisis
[1727.98 --> 1729.86]  and there were churches
[1729.86 --> 1730.54]  even then
[1730.54 --> 1731.20]  who were willing
[1731.20 --> 1732.58]  to go along
[1732.58 --> 1734.60]  and if I'm hearing
[1734.60 --> 1735.14]  missionaries
[1735.14 --> 1735.94]  who come to Canada
[1735.94 --> 1736.78]  rightly
[1736.78 --> 1737.56]  they would say
[1737.56 --> 1739.66]  you Christians in Canada
[1739.66 --> 1740.80]  you're willing
[1740.80 --> 1741.60]  to go along
[1741.60 --> 1745.42]  do not compromise
[1745.42 --> 1746.84]  and the pressure
[1746.84 --> 1747.38]  is real
[1747.38 --> 1748.28]  then and now
[1748.28 --> 1749.20]  for churches everywhere
[1749.20 --> 1750.04]  the pressure
[1750.04 --> 1750.54]  to sort of say
[1750.54 --> 1751.26]  okay if we just
[1751.26 --> 1752.72]  compromise on these things
[1752.72 --> 1753.32]  don't talk about
[1753.32 --> 1753.90]  these teachings
[1753.90 --> 1754.72]  don't bring up
[1754.72 --> 1755.26]  these issues
[1755.26 --> 1755.70]  and we're going to be
[1755.70 --> 1756.32]  just fine
[1756.32 --> 1757.16]  we're going to make it
[1757.16 --> 1759.16]  and in successful
[1759.16 --> 1760.20]  powerful places
[1760.20 --> 1760.90]  like Rome
[1760.90 --> 1762.64]  churches have the added
[1762.64 --> 1763.16]  pressure of
[1763.16 --> 1763.68]  you know what
[1763.68 --> 1764.74]  I could actually
[1764.74 --> 1765.72]  live a good life
[1765.72 --> 1767.36]  this is a peaceful empire
[1767.36 --> 1769.38]  there's safe travel
[1769.38 --> 1770.16]  there's trade
[1770.16 --> 1770.88]  coming to my city
[1770.88 --> 1772.06]  if I play my cards right
[1772.06 --> 1773.02]  I get comfort
[1773.02 --> 1774.24]  safety and prosperity
[1774.24 --> 1775.00]  now
[1775.00 --> 1776.90]  the pressure is real
[1776.90 --> 1777.78]  and I think we can relate
[1777.78 --> 1778.32]  to some of the things
[1778.32 --> 1779.18]  I just mentioned
[1779.18 --> 1780.56]  the temptation
[1780.56 --> 1780.68]  the temptation
[1780.68 --> 1781.28]  is to
[1781.28 --> 1782.88]  go with the flow
[1782.88 --> 1784.44]  play it safe
[1784.44 --> 1786.26]  enjoy the benefits
[1786.26 --> 1787.20]  that come from this
[1787.20 --> 1787.92]  yeah it's corrupt
[1787.92 --> 1788.72]  but there's benefits
[1788.72 --> 1789.24]  to living
[1789.24 --> 1790.34]  in the Roman Empire
[1790.34 --> 1790.98]  at that time
[1790.98 --> 1794.30]  as one person put it
[1794.30 --> 1794.72]  the problem
[1794.72 --> 1795.64]  with many of these churches
[1795.64 --> 1797.22]  is that they were
[1797.22 --> 1798.14]  too at home
[1798.14 --> 1799.26]  in Rome
[1799.26 --> 1801.18]  and interestingly
[1801.18 --> 1801.94]  the book of Revelation
[1801.94 --> 1803.34]  never says the word Rome
[1803.34 --> 1804.32]  you know what word it uses?
[1805.30 --> 1805.68]  Babylon
[1805.68 --> 1806.62]  and it's actually
[1806.62 --> 1807.82]  drawing from the book of Daniel
[1807.82 --> 1808.42]  a ton of drawing
[1808.42 --> 1809.18]  from the book of Daniel
[1809.18 --> 1809.68]  in Revelation
[1809.68 --> 1811.78]  Babylon was that corrupt empire
[1811.78 --> 1812.28]  where the
[1812.28 --> 1812.58]  you know
[1812.58 --> 1813.70]  Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego
[1813.70 --> 1814.80]  and Daniel
[1814.80 --> 1815.92]  they had to stand against
[1815.92 --> 1817.16]  that powerful narrative
[1817.16 --> 1819.42]  and be a suffering witness
[1819.42 --> 1821.52]  and Richard Bacham
[1821.52 --> 1821.86]  he says
[1821.86 --> 1822.14]  you know
[1822.14 --> 1823.30]  Babylon is sort of this
[1823.30 --> 1825.00]  image for all corrupt cities
[1825.00 --> 1826.54]  that are built around idols
[1826.54 --> 1827.20]  that aren't Jesus
[1827.20 --> 1828.04]  and he says
[1828.04 --> 1828.90]  any society
[1828.90 --> 1830.90]  whom Babylon's cap fits
[1830.90 --> 1832.70]  must wear it
[1832.70 --> 1834.16]  even today
[1834.16 --> 1836.76]  wake up church
[1836.76 --> 1837.74]  is the message
[1837.74 --> 1838.54]  of Revelation
[1838.54 --> 1840.58]  know the times
[1840.58 --> 1841.46]  in which you're living
[1841.46 --> 1843.64]  you belong to Christ
[1843.64 --> 1846.26]  do not compromise
[1846.26 --> 1848.56]  the second message
[1848.56 --> 1849.00]  related
[1849.00 --> 1850.16]  that's threaded through
[1850.16 --> 1850.72]  these letters
[1850.72 --> 1852.20]  is simply that
[1852.20 --> 1853.52]  Jesus is the only king
[1853.52 --> 1854.88]  and his kingdom
[1854.88 --> 1855.76]  is the only one
[1855.76 --> 1856.86]  that's going to remain
[1856.86 --> 1858.50]  the one who rose
[1858.50 --> 1859.02]  from the dead
[1859.02 --> 1859.72]  who's going to bring
[1859.72 --> 1860.52]  his whole creation
[1860.52 --> 1860.90]  to healing
[1860.90 --> 1862.24]  he is the only one
[1862.24 --> 1863.54]  who will stand
[1863.54 --> 1864.46]  in the end
[1864.46 --> 1866.06]  and my favorite part
[1866.06 --> 1866.88]  of Revelation 1
[1866.88 --> 1868.52]  is after Jesus
[1868.52 --> 1870.12]  John gets a vision
[1870.12 --> 1870.54]  of Jesus
[1870.54 --> 1871.14]  with the sword
[1871.14 --> 1872.00]  coming out of his mouth
[1872.00 --> 1873.18]  we read
[1873.18 --> 1874.28]  when I saw him
[1874.28 --> 1875.64]  I fell at his feet
[1875.64 --> 1876.80]  as though dead
[1876.80 --> 1877.74]  like John was just
[1877.74 --> 1878.18]  overcome
[1878.18 --> 1879.36]  by the power
[1879.36 --> 1879.84]  and the glory
[1879.84 --> 1880.38]  and the authority
[1880.38 --> 1880.82]  of Jesus
[1880.82 --> 1881.30]  and his vision
[1881.30 --> 1882.16]  he couldn't stand
[1882.16 --> 1882.68]  in the presence
[1882.68 --> 1884.22]  of this Jesus Christ
[1884.22 --> 1885.32]  the slain lamb
[1885.32 --> 1886.66]  and then what happens next
[1886.66 --> 1888.60]  Jesus puts his hand
[1888.60 --> 1889.46]  on John's shoulder
[1889.46 --> 1890.12]  and he says
[1890.12 --> 1891.86]  do not be afraid
[1891.86 --> 1893.10]  I'm the first
[1893.10 --> 1894.30]  and the last
[1894.30 --> 1897.04]  I am the living one
[1897.04 --> 1897.80]  I was dead
[1897.80 --> 1898.56]  and now look
[1898.56 --> 1899.42]  I'm alive
[1899.42 --> 1900.52]  forever and ever
[1900.52 --> 1901.46]  and what next
[1901.46 --> 1903.18]  I hold the keys
[1903.18 --> 1904.70]  of death
[1904.70 --> 1905.96]  and Hades
[1905.96 --> 1908.24]  that is a picture
[1908.24 --> 1909.98]  of the eternal king
[1909.98 --> 1912.52]  and you don't need
[1912.52 --> 1912.98]  to hear this
[1912.98 --> 1913.86]  but I'm going to
[1913.86 --> 1914.34]  say it anyway
[1914.34 --> 1915.32]  Domitian died
[1915.32 --> 1917.18]  Rome crumbled
[1917.18 --> 1919.26]  so did so many
[1919.26 --> 1920.26]  leaders behind him
[1920.26 --> 1921.10]  and so will
[1921.10 --> 1922.30]  every kingdom
[1922.30 --> 1923.16]  that's built around
[1923.16 --> 1924.38]  some other thing
[1924.38 --> 1924.98]  than Jesus
[1924.98 --> 1926.64]  some other thing
[1926.64 --> 1927.66]  that is not his authority
[1927.66 --> 1928.24]  his power
[1928.24 --> 1929.40]  and his royal kingship
[1929.40 --> 1930.42]  all kingdoms
[1930.42 --> 1931.78]  will not stand
[1931.78 --> 1932.42]  before him
[1932.42 --> 1935.42]  there's a quote
[1935.42 --> 1936.86]  from Napoleon Bonaparte
[1936.86 --> 1938.04]  he's a French emperor
[1938.04 --> 1939.08]  in the 18th century
[1939.08 --> 1939.88]  19th century
[1939.88 --> 1941.46]  lived 51 years
[1941.46 --> 1942.82]  conquered 16 countries
[1942.82 --> 1944.04]  and we all know
[1944.04 --> 1944.96]  Napoleon's story
[1944.96 --> 1945.72]  he was incredible
[1945.72 --> 1946.52]  at warfare
[1946.52 --> 1947.44]  he knew how to
[1947.44 --> 1948.10]  win battles
[1948.10 --> 1949.56]  but even Napoleon
[1949.56 --> 1951.20]  the best of the best
[1951.20 --> 1952.78]  pushed too far
[1952.78 --> 1953.70]  extended his borders
[1953.70 --> 1954.16]  too far
[1954.16 --> 1954.94]  and he got defeated
[1954.94 --> 1956.70]  and like John
[1956.70 --> 1957.50]  he was banished
[1957.50 --> 1957.98]  to an island
[1957.98 --> 1959.44]  and this is what
[1959.44 --> 1960.22]  Napoleon said
[1960.22 --> 1960.70]  about Jesus
[1960.70 --> 1961.52]  and other kingdoms
[1961.52 --> 1962.50]  shortly before
[1962.50 --> 1963.32]  his own death
[1963.32 --> 1963.90]  or at least he is
[1963.90 --> 1964.72]  quoted to have said
[1964.72 --> 1966.18]  Alexander
[1966.18 --> 1967.94]  Caesar
[1967.94 --> 1969.62]  Charlemagne
[1969.62 --> 1970.82]  and myself
[1970.82 --> 1972.54]  we all founded
[1972.54 --> 1973.22]  empires
[1973.22 --> 1975.34]  but what foundation
[1975.34 --> 1976.82]  did we rest
[1976.82 --> 1977.58]  the creation
[1977.58 --> 1978.70]  of our genius
[1978.70 --> 1981.04]  upon force
[1981.04 --> 1983.34]  Jesus Christ
[1983.34 --> 1984.34]  founded
[1984.34 --> 1985.32]  an empire
[1985.32 --> 1986.26]  upon love
[1986.26 --> 1988.08]  and at this hour
[1988.08 --> 1989.24]  millions of men
[1989.24 --> 1989.84]  would die
[1989.84 --> 1990.44]  for him
[1990.44 --> 1992.48]  there's that
[1992.48 --> 1993.46]  recognition there
[1993.46 --> 1994.36]  that the different
[1994.36 --> 1994.96]  kind of kingdom
[1994.96 --> 1996.40]  I mean you have
[1996.40 --> 1997.14]  the kings of the earth
[1997.14 --> 1997.68]  who build
[1997.68 --> 1998.38]  through violence
[1998.38 --> 1999.06]  and bloodshed
[1999.06 --> 1999.68]  and all the rest
[1999.68 --> 2000.30]  like Rome
[2000.30 --> 2001.30]  and then you have
[2001.30 --> 2001.82]  in Revelation
[2001.82 --> 2003.78]  a slain lamb
[2003.78 --> 2005.88]  that the center
[2005.88 --> 2006.52]  of victory
[2006.52 --> 2007.28]  is Jesus
[2007.28 --> 2008.28]  the great king
[2008.28 --> 2008.92]  of all
[2008.92 --> 2010.06]  allowing his own
[2010.06 --> 2011.00]  life to be taken
[2011.00 --> 2012.40]  so that the power
[2012.40 --> 2012.98]  of sin
[2012.98 --> 2014.18]  which is underneath
[2014.18 --> 2014.72]  and around
[2014.72 --> 2015.96]  every part of our world
[2015.96 --> 2016.64]  would be defeated
[2016.64 --> 2019.00]  that slain lamb
[2019.00 --> 2019.88]  is the alpha
[2019.88 --> 2020.82]  and the omega
[2020.82 --> 2022.46]  and John says
[2022.46 --> 2024.18]  that's the eternal
[2024.18 --> 2025.06]  king
[2025.06 --> 2026.24]  contra
[2026.24 --> 2027.24]  Domitian
[2027.24 --> 2028.84]  that's the eternal
[2028.84 --> 2029.08]  king
[2029.08 --> 2029.70]  he's the one
[2029.70 --> 2030.24]  who will stand
[2030.24 --> 2030.68]  at the end
[2030.68 --> 2031.46]  and make all
[2031.46 --> 2032.76]  things new
[2032.76 --> 2036.16]  finally
[2036.16 --> 2036.74]  the message
[2036.74 --> 2037.42]  to the church
[2037.42 --> 2038.46]  is a message
[2038.46 --> 2038.94]  of hope
[2038.94 --> 2041.34]  you who are
[2041.34 --> 2041.82]  faithful
[2041.82 --> 2043.86]  you who stand
[2043.86 --> 2045.00]  with and believe
[2045.00 --> 2045.70]  in Jesus
[2045.70 --> 2046.98]  you will be
[2046.98 --> 2047.52]  vindicated
[2047.52 --> 2049.14]  there's this phrase
[2049.14 --> 2049.56]  at the end
[2049.56 --> 2050.46]  of all the letters
[2050.46 --> 2052.34]  in this next
[2052.34 --> 2052.94]  couple chapters
[2052.94 --> 2053.96]  it's to those
[2053.96 --> 2055.22]  who are victorious
[2055.22 --> 2057.26]  and that phrase
[2057.26 --> 2058.30]  basically says
[2058.30 --> 2059.24]  those who are
[2059.24 --> 2059.94]  with Jesus
[2059.94 --> 2061.68]  share in
[2061.68 --> 2062.70]  Jesus' victory
[2062.70 --> 2064.48]  and the victory
[2064.48 --> 2065.20]  is not
[2065.20 --> 2066.30]  I need to say
[2066.30 --> 2066.76]  that the victory
[2066.76 --> 2067.50]  is not wealth
[2067.50 --> 2068.38]  comfort and power
[2068.38 --> 2068.98]  in this life
[2068.98 --> 2069.42]  there's nothing
[2069.42 --> 2070.26]  about that
[2070.26 --> 2070.80]  in Revelation
[2070.80 --> 2072.54]  the victory is
[2072.54 --> 2073.64]  this king
[2073.64 --> 2074.36]  is coming
[2074.36 --> 2075.26]  he's going to
[2075.26 --> 2076.16]  judge the nations
[2076.16 --> 2076.94]  he is the heavenly
[2076.94 --> 2078.42]  warrior of Revelation 19
[2078.42 --> 2079.52]  he will establish
[2079.52 --> 2079.94]  his kingdom
[2079.94 --> 2080.44]  in its fullness
[2080.44 --> 2081.60]  and you will
[2081.60 --> 2082.64]  forever share
[2082.64 --> 2083.82]  in his victory
[2083.82 --> 2086.58]  you will forever
[2086.58 --> 2087.08]  share
[2087.08 --> 2088.48]  in his eternal
[2088.48 --> 2089.28]  blessing
[2089.28 --> 2092.24]  I remember hearing
[2092.24 --> 2093.02]  a number of years ago
[2093.02 --> 2093.72]  and this is actually
[2093.72 --> 2094.36]  from a book
[2094.36 --> 2097.44]  that the way we think
[2097.44 --> 2098.56]  about our future hope
[2098.56 --> 2099.44]  is actually shaped
[2099.44 --> 2099.84]  quite a bit
[2099.84 --> 2100.74]  by our own context
[2100.74 --> 2102.12]  and western Christians
[2102.12 --> 2102.64]  we often think
[2102.64 --> 2103.32]  of the new creation
[2103.32 --> 2104.42]  as kind of what we have
[2104.42 --> 2105.34]  but a little bit better
[2105.34 --> 2106.34]  you know we have it
[2106.34 --> 2107.30]  pretty good in many ways
[2107.30 --> 2108.20]  it's just a little bit better
[2108.20 --> 2109.22]  when Jesus comes back
[2109.22 --> 2110.56]  but that's not what
[2110.56 --> 2111.34]  Christians around the world
[2111.34 --> 2111.72]  think
[2111.72 --> 2113.84]  Christians around the world
[2113.84 --> 2114.88]  are praying for that kingdom
[2114.88 --> 2115.28]  to come
[2115.28 --> 2116.76]  because they've lost
[2116.76 --> 2117.46]  loved ones
[2117.46 --> 2118.50]  and they're crying
[2118.50 --> 2119.74]  come soon Jesus
[2119.74 --> 2121.04]  hear your world
[2121.04 --> 2122.68]  come soon Jesus
[2122.68 --> 2123.30]  make it right
[2123.30 --> 2124.06]  come soon Jesus
[2124.06 --> 2125.48]  put an end to the corruption
[2125.48 --> 2126.94]  put an end to the violence
[2126.94 --> 2127.96]  put an end to the warfare
[2127.96 --> 2128.94]  put an end to the people
[2128.94 --> 2130.52]  destroying the church
[2130.52 --> 2132.08]  and causing pain
[2132.08 --> 2132.66]  in your world
[2132.66 --> 2133.64]  and they long
[2133.64 --> 2134.32]  for that day
[2134.32 --> 2135.14]  in a way that we need
[2135.14 --> 2136.02]  to learn from
[2136.02 --> 2138.10]  Jesus' return
[2138.10 --> 2139.54]  and his word
[2139.54 --> 2140.16]  to the church
[2140.16 --> 2140.80]  the suffering
[2140.80 --> 2141.64]  faithful church
[2141.64 --> 2143.38]  you will share
[2143.38 --> 2145.32]  in my coming victory
[2145.32 --> 2147.50]  stay faithful
[2147.50 --> 2149.72]  and again
[2149.72 --> 2150.86]  I find it so striking
[2150.86 --> 2152.28]  that it's this
[2152.28 --> 2154.28]  tiny little house church
[2154.28 --> 2154.98]  again
[2154.98 --> 2155.68]  imagine these
[2155.68 --> 2156.36]  little house churches
[2156.36 --> 2156.88]  these are not
[2156.88 --> 2157.90]  big mega churches
[2157.90 --> 2159.98]  these are little house churches
[2159.98 --> 2161.62]  and Jesus' word
[2161.62 --> 2162.20]  to them is
[2162.20 --> 2164.06]  I am
[2164.06 --> 2164.92]  the Alpha
[2164.92 --> 2165.56]  and the Omega
[2165.56 --> 2166.82]  I am
[2166.82 --> 2167.40]  the true king
[2167.40 --> 2168.74]  you know
[2168.74 --> 2170.06]  the true story
[2170.06 --> 2170.84]  and I'm coming
[2170.84 --> 2172.28]  I'm coming
[2172.28 --> 2173.26]  and you will be
[2173.26 --> 2174.08]  vindicated
[2174.08 --> 2174.92]  because you believe
[2174.92 --> 2175.36]  in me
[2175.36 --> 2177.52]  hold fast
[2177.52 --> 2179.02]  to the truth
[2179.02 --> 2181.52]  live faithfully
[2181.52 --> 2182.66]  under the pressure
[2182.66 --> 2183.76]  not only faithfully
[2183.76 --> 2184.84]  live as a source
[2184.84 --> 2185.82]  of blessing
[2185.82 --> 2188.22]  even under the pressure
[2188.22 --> 2190.42]  you will be vindicated
[2190.42 --> 2192.66]  do you know
[2192.66 --> 2192.80]  do you know how
[2192.80 --> 2193.74]  revelation ends
[2193.74 --> 2197.34]  revelation ends
[2197.34 --> 2198.50]  with Jesus saying
[2198.50 --> 2201.14]  I am coming
[2201.14 --> 2202.00]  soon
[2202.00 --> 2205.08]  that's Jesus' statement
[2205.08 --> 2205.82]  you know what John's
[2205.82 --> 2206.98]  response is
[2206.98 --> 2209.14]  I think John speaks
[2209.14 --> 2209.72]  for the church
[2209.72 --> 2210.38]  throughout history
[2210.38 --> 2210.90]  the church
[2210.90 --> 2211.50]  throughout the world
[2211.50 --> 2212.50]  the persecuted church
[2212.50 --> 2213.12]  when he says
[2213.12 --> 2214.26]  yes
[2214.26 --> 2215.98]  come soon
[2215.98 --> 2216.62]  Jesus
[2216.62 --> 2217.60]  amen
[2217.60 --> 2219.48]  amen
[2219.48 --> 2220.68]  let's pray
[2220.68 --> 2225.86]  father I pray
[2225.86 --> 2226.50]  that you melt
[2226.50 --> 2227.20]  our hearts
[2227.20 --> 2228.24]  through the book
[2228.24 --> 2228.78]  of revelation
[2228.78 --> 2230.64]  I pray
[2230.64 --> 2231.32]  that you give us
[2231.32 --> 2232.36]  ears to hear
[2232.36 --> 2234.68]  eyes to see
[2234.68 --> 2236.50]  what John saw
[2236.50 --> 2237.40]  in this revelation
[2237.40 --> 2238.90]  I pray
[2238.90 --> 2239.68]  that our view
[2239.68 --> 2240.24]  of Jesus
[2240.24 --> 2240.98]  and all that
[2240.98 --> 2241.72]  he had done
[2241.72 --> 2242.64]  and has done
[2242.64 --> 2243.74]  and continues
[2243.74 --> 2244.18]  to do
[2244.18 --> 2244.90]  would expand
[2244.90 --> 2246.24]  and that you
[2246.24 --> 2246.80]  would fill us
[2246.80 --> 2247.76]  not with confidence
[2247.76 --> 2248.72]  only confidence
[2248.72 --> 2249.56]  of what is finished
[2249.56 --> 2250.22]  on the cross
[2250.22 --> 2251.80]  but what is coming
[2251.80 --> 2255.68]  make us a faithful church
[2255.68 --> 2259.04]  make us faithful witnesses
[2259.04 --> 2262.00]  pour out your Holy Spirit
[2262.00 --> 2262.62]  on us
[2262.62 --> 2263.34]  so that we would
[2263.34 --> 2264.12]  be faithful
[2264.12 --> 2265.46]  and that we would
[2265.46 --> 2266.20]  be a source
[2266.20 --> 2267.04]  of blessing
[2267.04 --> 2268.48]  in our city
[2268.48 --> 2270.48]  amen
[2270.48 --> 2275.06]  in a moment
[2275.06 --> 2275.60]  we're going to sing
[2275.60 --> 2277.02]  our song of response
[2277.02 --> 2277.76]  our final song
[2277.76 --> 2278.28]  of this service
[2278.28 --> 2278.86]  and I just want you
[2278.86 --> 2279.48]  to know that
[2279.48 --> 2281.14]  one of the strange
[2281.14 --> 2281.44]  things
[2281.44 --> 2282.36]  or perhaps the ominous
[2282.36 --> 2282.88]  things about the
[2282.88 --> 2283.56]  book of revelation
[2283.56 --> 2285.62]  is that none of the
[2285.62 --> 2286.04]  churches
[2286.04 --> 2288.00]  that are written to
[2288.00 --> 2289.58]  and these letters
[2289.58 --> 2291.12]  are existent anymore
[2291.12 --> 2292.18]  they're all gone
[2292.18 --> 2293.24]  there's different churches
[2293.24 --> 2293.98]  in different parts
[2293.98 --> 2294.94]  of the Roman area
[2294.94 --> 2296.14]  but these churches
[2296.14 --> 2296.86]  there's no evidence
[2296.86 --> 2297.78]  that they're still around
[2297.78 --> 2299.86]  and it's a reminder
[2299.86 --> 2300.76]  at least to me
[2300.76 --> 2302.64]  of the short time
[2302.64 --> 2303.78]  we get as churches
[2303.78 --> 2304.34]  in our cities
[2304.34 --> 2304.94]  to bear witness
[2304.94 --> 2305.42]  to Christ
[2305.42 --> 2307.30]  and it's also a reminder
[2307.30 --> 2308.08]  that we are not
[2308.08 --> 2309.10]  the ones who build
[2309.10 --> 2310.54]  or bring the kingdom
[2310.54 --> 2311.72]  but we are witnesses
[2311.72 --> 2312.90]  to the Jesus
[2312.90 --> 2313.86]  who will come
[2313.86 --> 2314.70]  and this song
[2314.70 --> 2315.32]  that we sing
[2315.32 --> 2317.16]  is a very effective song
[2317.16 --> 2317.40]  to say
[2317.40 --> 2318.54]  no matter how small
[2318.54 --> 2319.54]  our legacy is
[2319.54 --> 2320.98]  how short our lives are
[2320.98 --> 2321.82]  Jesus is coming
[2321.82 --> 2323.36]  and he will establish
[2323.36 --> 2323.78]  his kingdom
[2323.78 --> 2324.68]  so I invite you to stand
[2324.68 --> 2325.18]  and sing with me
[2325.18 --> 2325.88]  our final song
