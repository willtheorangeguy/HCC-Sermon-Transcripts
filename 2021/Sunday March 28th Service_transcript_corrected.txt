[0.00 → 7.42] Well, I feel blessed that by Jonathan's introduction and Nana's prayer,
[7.62 → 11.00] you've already received much wisdom and insight on fasting,
[11.10 → 14.56] and I say amen to everything that they have prayed for and spoken already.
[16.08 → 18.58] Just a couple words before we open the scriptures.
[19.10 → 23.48] The first is we want to follow up on the rule of life that we're inviting everyone to develop.
[23.80 → 26.80] This week we posted a video where Misha shared about her rule of life,
[26.80 → 31.80] and we also sent some resources, a workbook, in fact, that you can literally just print off and work through.
[32.24 → 33.50] And we don't want you to let it slide.
[33.56 → 35.40] We want you to keep it on your minds and your hearts
[35.40 → 38.26] and take the time over the next couple of weeks to write out a rule of life.
[38.62 → 41.26] We realize that for many of us this might be the first time,
[41.46 → 44.14] the first time when you've taken your desire to grow in Christ
[44.14 → 47.08] and you've placed it in an intentional plan, an intentional schedule,
[47.26 → 49.30] and we think that is a beautiful thing.
[49.42 → 50.80] So take the time for the rule of life.
[51.10 → 53.00] We will be sending more resources this week again
[53.00 → 56.18] because we want to keep it top of mind as we finish up this series.
[56.96 → 63.40] Secondly, I just want to say how excited I am to see 50 of you at 9 a.m. next Sunday and at 11 again.
[64.18 → 66.74] It's not the whole congregation, but it is a beautiful thing.
[66.84 → 70.58] And yesterday we had our children's Easter camp that Esther led,
[70.72 → 72.64] and it was a gift just to see each other.
[73.36 → 76.92] And I am delighted that we can be together at least in part next Sunday morning.
[77.78 → 81.56] I will say it was a sign of health that my phone went off a bunch this week before,
[81.64 → 82.86] even read the public health order,
[82.96 → 84.38] and just a number of people saying to me,
[84.38 → 85.76] Hey, we can gather in 50 again.
[85.82 → 86.36] What are we doing?
[86.44 → 87.14] Are we going to register?
[87.26 → 88.00] When will we register?
[88.12 → 88.68] Where's the link?
[89.24 → 90.60] And so, yeah, that is on Monday,
[90.80 → 93.32] and we are very excited that you are excited as well
[93.32 → 95.08] to return to worship in person.
[96.56 → 99.02] We're going to continue our series on apprenticing with Jesus,
[99.26 → 103.02] and we're going to look this morning at the specific practice of fasting,
[103.22 → 105.90] probably the most popular fasting or practice.
[106.44 → 107.28] That was a joke.
[107.48 → 108.66] Nobody laughed except for Nana.
[108.66 → 112.66] This is an important practice for the life of the church,
[112.80 → 113.90] the history of God's people.
[114.64 → 116.18] And before we jump into it,
[116.22 → 118.02] I just want to say that the last four weeks,
[118.12 → 119.44] we've looked at silence and solitude,
[119.66 → 121.62] we have looked at Sabbath,
[122.10 → 122.96] we've looked at confession,
[123.14 → 123.86] and we've looked now,
[123.92 → 125.06] we are looking now at fasting.
[125.48 → 128.12] And for those of you who are looking at the spiritual disciplines as a whole
[128.12 → 128.98] and how to implement them,
[129.06 → 131.64] I want you to know that you can do all four of these in once.
[131.72 → 133.96] And this is a Justin Curry thought if you're watching, Justin.
[133.96 → 137.16] So if you, on a Sabbath, you practice silence and solitude,
[137.28 → 138.76] you're fasting, and you're confessing,
[139.08 → 139.62] there you go.
[140.04 → 143.20] All the practices we've looked at in Lent all together.
[144.58 → 145.76] All right, if you have your Bible,
[145.98 → 147.82] turn with me to Matthew chapter 6.
[148.54 → 150.24] We're going to listen to what Jesus says
[150.24 → 152.78] in the Sermon on the Mount on fasting.
[153.50 → 154.70] And if you don't know the Sermon on the Mount,
[154.80 → 156.30] this is really, as some people describe,
[156.50 → 159.86] apprenticing manual of what it means to be a disciple.
[160.32 → 162.92] This is Matthew chapter 6, verse 16 to 18.
[163.96 → 168.00] When you fast,
[168.70 → 171.50] do not look sombre as the hypocrites do.
[172.16 → 175.50] They disfigure their faces to show others that they are fasting.
[176.34 → 177.32] Truly I tell you,
[177.52 → 179.40] they've received their reward in full.
[180.32 → 181.50] But when you fast,
[182.04 → 184.88] put oil on your head and wash your face
[184.88 → 187.68] so that it will not be obvious to others that you're fasting,
[187.68 → 190.52] but only to your Father who is unseen.
[190.52 → 194.26] And your Father who sees what is done in secret
[194.26 → 196.40] will reward you.
[196.40 → 203.00] I was told by someone this week
[203.00 → 204.96] that preaching on fasting right now
[204.96 → 206.64] is a cruel thing to do.
[207.62 → 209.36] It's been just over a year
[209.36 → 211.72] that most of us have been in some kind of lockdown.
[211.92 → 212.42] For some of us,
[212.46 → 214.94] that's a whole year working from home,
[215.04 → 216.34] having our work laptop
[216.34 → 218.98] 25 steps away from the kitchen cupboard.
[218.98 → 220.98] And I'm told that there are a few of us
[220.98 → 222.56] who have the quarantine 15.
[223.76 → 225.68] And here we are talking about fasting.
[226.78 → 228.30] What are we to make of fasting?
[229.56 → 232.46] I feel like a lot of us have questions about fasting,
[232.58 → 234.06] and I'm guessing that most of us
[234.06 → 236.68] prefer not to deal with this thing of fasting
[236.68 → 238.88] because we don't want to practice it.
[238.88 → 242.12] A study done in North America,
[242.22 → 243.12] or the U.S. rather,
[243.34 → 244.40] a few years ago now,
[244.94 → 248.78] revealed that 50% of American Christians never fast.
[249.76 → 254.68] 40% of American Christians fast very irregularly.
[255.36 → 256.90] And of the remaining 10%,
[256.90 → 259.54] only 2% of Christians in the U.S.
[259.92 → 261.98] fast on a regular basis.
[262.70 → 264.60] And I don't know the makeup of our own church,
[264.72 → 267.64] but I'm guessing that's probably where we land.
[267.64 → 270.94] Most of us, 50% of us, never fast.
[271.26 → 273.92] 40% of us, maybe sometimes.
[274.28 → 277.32] And 2% of us on a regular basis.
[277.80 → 279.22] And I'm guessing that 2%
[279.22 → 281.28] probably grew up in another culture.
[281.92 → 283.26] That's just a hunch I have.
[285.30 → 287.26] Do we have it within ourselves
[287.26 → 289.12] to say no to our stomachs?
[290.38 → 292.48] Do we as apprentices of Jesus
[292.48 → 296.14] have the ability to fast?
[296.14 → 298.16] And if we do, why do we fast?
[298.66 → 300.24] And one of the things I realized this week,
[300.30 → 301.56] and I've come across this before,
[301.66 → 303.80] is that there are a lot of different perspectives
[303.80 → 305.12] on fasting.
[305.74 → 307.60] On whether we should fast.
[307.68 → 308.74] What its benefit is.
[308.78 → 310.30] And there are those who do say
[310.30 → 313.06] fasting is an essential part
[313.06 → 314.56] of the life of an apprentice of Jesus.
[315.28 → 317.40] It is something that we should be doing.
[317.56 → 319.04] And it should be built into the habits
[319.04 → 320.14] and the rhythms of our lives.
[320.20 → 321.66] It's how we deny ourselves.
[321.96 → 324.16] It's how we follow in the likeness of Jesus.
[324.16 → 325.92] It's what we should be doing.
[326.86 → 328.04] Fasting is essential.
[328.44 → 329.98] There are others who say
[329.98 → 331.68] fasting is not a command.
[332.60 → 333.50] Jesus never says,
[334.02 → 335.44] you have to fast.
[335.84 → 337.24] It may have benefits,
[337.62 → 339.46] but we don't need to do it.
[340.18 → 341.38] And I think all of us in our guts
[341.38 → 342.98] want that to be the case, don't we?
[343.00 → 344.18] You don't have to fast.
[344.98 → 346.10] And I'm sure there are some of us,
[346.14 → 346.70] even this morning,
[346.76 → 347.34] as you're listening,
[347.44 → 347.76] you're thinking,
[347.88 → 349.14] is it really that important?
[350.04 → 351.32] Do we really need to do this?
[351.32 → 353.20] I mean, creation is good.
[353.34 → 353.98] Food is good.
[354.06 → 355.36] We need food to live.
[355.48 → 357.86] Why would we need to not eat
[357.86 → 360.02] for periods of time?
[360.96 → 362.06] And so we turn again
[362.06 → 362.82] to the words of Jesus,
[363.40 → 365.30] our Saviour, our Lord, and our Teacher,
[365.42 → 366.12] and ask,
[366.26 → 367.40] what is it that he has to say
[367.40 → 368.30] to the church today
[368.30 → 369.62] about fasting?
[370.48 → 372.24] Recognizing that we live
[372.24 → 373.76] in food-saturated,
[374.04 → 375.42] everything excess,
[376.14 → 376.48] Canada,
[376.66 → 378.16] as we hear these words on fasting.
[378.16 → 381.84] The first thing I want to note
[381.84 → 382.82] about Jesus' words
[382.82 → 383.90] in the Sermon on the Mount
[383.90 → 386.52] is that it is not preached to us.
[386.92 → 387.98] These are not words preached
[387.98 → 390.28] to 21st century North Americans
[390.28 → 391.74] living in British Columbia.
[392.28 → 393.56] Actually, I spent a lot of time
[393.56 → 394.24] wondering this week,
[394.54 → 395.64] what would Jesus say
[395.64 → 397.00] if Jesus preached the Sermon
[397.00 → 397.88] on Burnaby Mountain
[397.88 → 398.90] to British Columbians?
[399.12 → 399.92] I would love to hear
[399.92 → 400.86] your reflections on that,
[400.90 → 401.78] but Jesus is speaking
[401.78 → 402.82] to Jewish people
[402.82 → 405.42] in first century Rome.
[406.30 → 407.92] And they think differently,
[407.92 → 408.88] they live differently,
[409.00 → 409.96] they've got different rhythms
[409.96 → 410.46] of life,
[410.52 → 411.90] and Jesus is contextualizing
[411.90 → 413.20] his words to them.
[414.04 → 414.98] And so when Jesus preaches
[414.98 → 415.70] on prayer,
[415.84 → 416.84] he's preaching to a
[416.84 → 418.78] prayer-saturated culture.
[418.90 → 419.42] Jewish people,
[419.54 → 420.50] they know how to pray.
[421.32 → 421.86] And likewise,
[422.04 → 422.94] when Jesus is speaking
[422.94 → 423.66] on fasting,
[424.52 → 425.60] he's preaching to people
[425.60 → 427.86] who fast all the time.
[429.02 → 430.22] He doesn't need to explain
[430.22 → 431.22] to them what fasting is
[431.22 → 432.12] because they do it.
[432.48 → 433.16] From what we know,
[433.26 → 434.30] Jewish people fasted
[434.30 → 434.94] once a year
[434.94 → 435.86] on the Day of Atonement.
[435.86 → 436.74] It was associated
[436.74 → 437.44] with confession
[437.44 → 438.14] and repentance.
[438.92 → 440.26] When Jesus came onto the scene,
[440.50 → 441.42] Jewish people were fasting
[441.42 → 443.22] on average twice a week.
[443.82 → 444.24] That's right,
[444.48 → 445.36] twice a week.
[445.46 → 446.78] They fasted on Mondays
[446.78 → 448.86] and they fasted on Thursdays.
[449.70 → 450.80] And just as an aside,
[451.66 → 452.24] from what we know
[452.24 → 452.86] of the early church,
[452.94 → 453.64] they did not do away
[453.64 → 454.20] with fasting.
[454.42 → 454.64] In fact,
[454.70 → 455.74] I spent a lot of time
[455.74 → 456.48] this week looking
[456.48 → 457.32] at early Christianity
[457.32 → 458.04] and church leaders
[458.04 → 459.10] in the early church
[459.10 → 459.98] and they did not do away
[459.98 → 460.38] with fasting.
[460.48 → 461.36] They often just shifted
[461.36 → 461.88] the days.
[461.96 → 462.74] It went to a Wednesday
[462.74 → 463.46] and a Friday
[463.46 → 465.16] as a way of differentiating
[465.16 → 466.12] themselves from Jews,
[466.20 → 466.98] saying we as Christians,
[467.10 → 467.66] we still fast,
[467.74 → 468.58] but it's on these days
[468.58 → 469.52] and it's now oriented
[469.52 → 470.66] around the life of Jesus
[470.66 → 471.94] and not the practices
[471.94 → 472.60] of the past.
[472.94 → 473.50] And I find that
[473.50 → 474.10] really intriguing.
[475.14 → 475.90] But Jesus didn't need
[475.90 → 477.20] to explain fasting
[477.20 → 478.64] because they fasted.
[478.70 → 480.24] They fasted all the time.
[481.42 → 482.80] But what Jesus does want to do
[482.80 → 483.90] in Matthew chapter 6
[483.90 → 487.36] is look at why people fast.
[487.36 → 488.66] He wants to explore
[488.66 → 490.02] the motivation behind
[490.02 → 491.16] why these people
[491.16 → 492.08] he's preaching to
[492.08 → 493.56] do their fasting.
[494.24 → 495.06] And it's really important
[495.06 → 495.90] to realize that Jesus
[495.90 → 497.14] is always interested
[497.14 → 498.58] not just in the practice
[498.58 → 499.36] but the posture
[499.36 → 500.08] of the practice.
[500.34 → 501.68] Not just that you do something,
[502.24 → 503.18] that you do it
[503.18 → 503.90] for the right reasons.
[504.00 → 504.86] And he's not interested
[504.86 → 505.92] in the kind of fasting
[505.92 → 506.48] he's seeing
[506.48 → 508.90] in the world of his day.
[509.00 → 509.70] Listen to what he says
[509.70 → 510.06] at the beginning.
[510.18 → 510.30] He says,
[510.42 → 511.20] When you fast,
[511.36 → 512.52] do not look sombre
[512.52 → 514.10] as the hypocrites do.
[514.54 → 516.06] For they disfigure their faces
[516.06 → 516.92] to show others
[516.92 → 517.68] that they are fasting.
[518.00 → 518.96] Truly I tell you,
[519.02 → 519.78] they have received
[519.78 → 521.78] their reward in full.
[523.14 → 523.92] Now for our purposes
[523.92 → 524.44] this morning,
[524.50 → 525.22] I just want to highlight
[525.22 → 526.98] that Jesus did not say
[526.98 → 527.42] to them,
[528.00 → 529.36] stop fasting.
[530.18 → 531.22] I happen to think
[531.22 → 532.04] that if Jesus wanted
[532.04 → 532.82] fasting to stop,
[533.02 → 533.72] this would have been
[533.72 → 534.46] the point at which
[534.46 → 534.72] he said,
[534.78 → 535.16] Hey people,
[535.50 → 536.12] this practice
[536.12 → 537.52] is so not necessary.
[537.90 → 538.90] All this stuff you're doing
[538.90 → 539.68] is not worth it.
[539.80 → 540.38] Stop fasting.
[540.44 → 541.44] But he does not say that.
[542.10 → 543.00] He looks at why
[543.00 → 544.34] the fasting is happening.
[545.16 → 545.80] He's exploring
[545.80 → 546.44] the motivations
[546.44 → 547.04] that are driving
[547.04 → 547.60] the way they do
[547.60 → 548.08] their fast.
[548.64 → 549.34] Jesus though,
[549.46 → 550.34] is not interested
[550.34 → 551.24] at all
[551.24 → 552.32] in the kind of fasting
[552.32 → 552.74] he's seeing.
[552.80 → 553.92] He calls it hypocritical.
[554.88 → 555.58] What's going on here?
[555.66 → 556.80] There's people saying
[556.80 → 558.42] that these Jewish people
[558.42 → 559.30] who are doing the fast
[559.30 → 560.48] are play-acting.
[561.16 → 561.98] They're looking
[561.98 → 562.86] all dishevelled.
[562.94 → 563.32] They're sort of
[563.32 → 564.58] making a mess of themselves,
[564.78 → 565.42] showing people
[565.42 → 566.20] that they've been fasting
[566.20 → 566.90] for a long time,
[567.18 → 568.04] drawing attention
[568.04 → 568.68] to themselves.
[569.64 → 570.60] Why are they fasting?
[571.64 → 573.26] They want to be seen.
[573.50 → 574.42] They want to be praised.
[574.52 → 575.48] They want to be recognized.
[575.80 → 577.26] For this hard act
[577.26 → 577.70] of fasting
[577.70 → 578.30] that they're doing.
[579.28 → 580.24] And Jesus has a word
[580.24 → 580.64] for them.
[581.24 → 581.92] You know what it is?
[583.08 → 583.56] Hypocrite.
[584.10 → 585.20] That's a strong word.
[585.68 → 586.16] These are people
[586.16 → 586.80] who are devoting
[586.80 → 587.48] a lot of time
[587.48 → 588.90] to this very difficult thing
[588.90 → 589.68] for Western people,
[589.78 → 590.06] fasting.
[590.16 → 590.70] And Jesus says,
[591.22 → 593.00] that is hypocrisy.
[593.90 → 594.46] And the reason
[594.46 → 595.20] it's hypocrisy
[595.20 → 596.00] is that fasting
[596.00 → 597.86] is so that
[597.86 → 598.96] people can draw
[598.96 → 599.58] in humble,
[599.80 → 600.76] prayerful piety
[600.76 → 602.00] before their Heavenly Father.
[602.38 → 603.06] They can be
[603.06 → 603.92] in His presence.
[603.92 → 604.94] And what are they doing?
[605.80 → 607.04] They're taking this practice
[607.04 → 608.06] and they're turning it
[608.06 → 609.22] in towards themselves
[609.22 → 611.02] so that they are noticed,
[611.12 → 611.98] so that they are praised,
[612.04 → 613.30] so that they are seen
[613.30 → 614.20] by the crowds.
[614.28 → 614.70] And people say,
[614.94 → 615.30] wow,
[615.46 → 617.14] look at them fasting.
[617.86 → 618.80] So faithful,
[619.40 → 620.28] so pious,
[620.66 → 622.12] so dedicated to God.
[622.74 → 623.68] And Jesus says,
[624.70 → 625.24] hypocrite.
[625.24 → 628.72] And,
[628.86 → 629.60] quite alarmingly,
[629.66 → 630.16] he says,
[630.86 → 631.60] they have received
[631.60 → 632.66] the reward in full.
[633.50 → 634.52] And what he means to say is,
[634.90 → 635.96] people have turned their heads.
[636.18 → 636.86] They've noticed.
[637.02 → 638.02] They are perhaps impressed
[638.02 → 639.30] and are giving praise
[639.30 → 640.02] and applause
[640.02 → 641.00] to those who are fasting
[641.00 → 642.12] and look so disfigured
[642.12 → 643.08] and so heavy
[643.08 → 643.58] under the weight
[643.58 → 644.32] of this practice.
[645.30 → 646.74] But God's approval
[646.74 → 647.82] will not be found
[647.82 → 648.38] in the crowds.
[649.74 → 650.96] God's favour
[650.96 → 651.96] will not be found
[651.96 → 652.56] in those people
[652.56 → 653.22] who are noticing.
[653.98 → 655.48] That's an alarming statement
[655.48 → 657.08] because at the end of the day,
[657.86 → 658.76] the approval we seek,
[658.80 → 659.84] at the end of our lives,
[659.90 → 660.38] I should add,
[660.42 → 661.16] the approval we seek
[661.16 → 662.94] is not that of the crowds,
[663.54 → 664.30] of those people
[664.30 → 665.24] who see us doing this
[665.24 → 666.02] or not doing this.
[666.06 → 666.80] The approval we seek
[666.80 → 667.92] is that of our Heavenly Father.
[668.68 → 669.90] And it will not be found
[669.90 → 671.06] in play-acting
[671.06 → 672.16] and manipulating
[672.16 → 673.68] and turning spiritual practices
[673.68 → 674.92] as a way of boosting
[674.92 → 676.06] one's own ego.
[677.70 → 678.90] So Jesus turns
[678.90 → 680.92] and to say more positively,
[681.08 → 681.32] he says,
[681.44 → 682.24] when you fast,
[682.24 → 683.32] put oil on your head
[683.32 → 684.40] and wash your face
[684.40 → 685.98] so that it will not be obvious
[685.98 → 686.48] to others
[686.48 → 687.64] that you are fasting,
[688.00 → 689.48] but only to your Father
[689.48 → 690.34] who is unseen
[690.34 → 692.58] and your Father
[692.58 → 693.60] who sees what's done
[693.60 → 694.10] in secret
[694.10 → 696.08] will reward you.
[697.56 → 698.58] Now this actually
[698.58 → 700.08] touches on a recurring teaching
[700.08 → 700.70] that we see
[700.70 → 701.52] throughout the Sermon on the Mount
[701.52 → 702.38] and that's Jesus saying,
[702.74 → 704.16] do not preoccupy yourselves
[704.16 → 704.84] with the crowds.
[705.28 → 706.52] Do not preoccupy yourself
[706.52 → 708.00] with what people see you doing.
[708.10 → 708.50] You're giving,
[708.64 → 709.10] you're tithing,
[709.18 → 709.74] you're generosity,
[710.04 → 710.60] you're fasting,
[710.74 → 711.06] you're praying,
[711.06 → 712.02] all of it.
[713.02 → 714.02] Don't be concerned
[714.02 → 715.56] with what people are seeing
[715.56 → 716.62] or how they will think of you.
[716.96 → 718.96] Focus on your Heavenly Father.
[720.16 → 721.10] He sees you.
[721.86 → 722.76] And I love this line
[722.76 → 723.20] where he sees,
[723.30 → 725.06] your Father who is unseen
[725.06 → 726.34] sees what's done
[726.34 → 727.12] in secrecy.
[727.80 → 729.46] That is a powerful line.
[730.72 → 731.88] Every quiet act
[731.88 → 732.46] of obedience,
[733.62 → 734.20] he sees.
[734.20 → 736.34] Every quiet act
[736.34 → 737.26] of faithfulness,
[737.62 → 738.38] of generosity,
[738.74 → 739.46] of care,
[739.74 → 740.60] of love,
[741.06 → 741.74] to the lowest,
[741.92 → 742.32] the least,
[742.42 → 743.00] the unseen,
[743.12 → 743.80] the unnoticed,
[744.36 → 745.28] God sees
[745.28 → 747.02] and rewards.
[747.86 → 749.20] That is a beautiful thing.
[750.20 → 751.10] You don't need to worry
[751.10 → 752.06] about what others see.
[752.22 → 753.18] What you need to worry about
[753.18 → 754.42] is what your Father sees
[754.42 → 756.16] and he sees what you do
[756.16 → 757.42] with him
[757.42 → 758.42] and for him
[758.42 → 760.44] in unseen ways.
[760.44 → 763.24] And when you fast,
[763.98 → 765.78] to draw into his presence,
[765.92 → 766.90] to hear him speak,
[767.12 → 768.40] to listen for him,
[769.02 → 770.50] he will bless you.
[771.36 → 772.62] You will receive
[772.62 → 773.68] the Father's blessing.
[773.94 → 774.80] You will receive
[774.80 → 775.58] the Father's presence.
[775.82 → 776.90] He will make you
[776.90 → 777.66] like Jesus.
[777.78 → 778.84] That is his intention.
[780.06 → 780.80] You will receive
[780.80 → 781.40] the reward
[781.40 → 783.42] your heart longs for.
[783.42 → 788.12] The main thrust
[788.12 → 788.98] of this passage
[788.98 → 790.20] is actually
[790.20 → 790.86] the examination
[790.86 → 792.16] of motives
[792.16 → 792.80] for fasting.
[793.66 → 794.12] And I think
[794.12 → 794.78] that's a word and season
[794.78 → 795.38] for anyone
[795.38 → 796.00] of our practices.
[796.72 → 797.42] I don't think
[797.42 → 799.06] that we are struggling
[799.06 → 799.90] right now as a church
[799.90 → 800.74] with people fasting
[800.74 → 801.66] and trying to be seen
[801.66 → 802.26] by their neighbours.
[802.42 → 803.06] Maybe you see that.
[803.14 → 803.82] I don't see that
[803.82 → 804.62] at Hope Community Church.
[804.70 → 805.74] People look well washed
[805.74 → 807.12] here in their faces.
[808.12 → 809.02] But I do think
[809.02 → 809.66] there is a temptation
[809.66 → 810.82] in all of our hearts
[810.82 → 812.36] to take a spiritual discipline,
[812.36 → 813.66] a habit of faith,
[814.02 → 814.62] and to somehow
[814.62 → 815.96] turn it in on ourselves.
[816.48 → 817.78] Somehow make it about us.
[818.00 → 819.30] And it's worth to pause
[819.30 → 820.10] and ask,
[820.34 → 821.30] how do you talk
[821.30 → 822.22] about your disciplines?
[822.96 → 823.58] How do you talk
[823.58 → 824.76] about the rhythms of faith,
[825.02 → 825.92] whether it be fasting
[825.92 → 826.94] or giving or tithing
[826.94 → 827.90] or any other practice
[827.90 → 828.46] that we do?
[829.52 → 830.84] How do you talk about it?
[831.40 → 832.18] When you post,
[832.26 → 832.84] if you post,
[833.00 → 833.94] what's your motive
[833.94 → 835.30] for posting about it
[835.30 → 836.64] and speaking about it?
[837.10 → 838.30] And the fundamental question is,
[838.36 → 839.82] is God at the centre
[839.82 → 840.64] of that practice?
[840.64 → 842.08] Is the goal of that practice
[842.08 → 843.94] to become like Jesus?
[844.74 → 845.68] Because if it's not,
[845.74 → 846.88] it's probably being turned
[846.88 → 848.26] in some way or another
[848.26 → 850.44] in towards the self,
[851.32 → 852.30] that powerful idol
[852.30 → 854.02] that crops into any good thing,
[854.14 → 855.20] even spiritual disciplines.
[857.46 → 858.64] But here's my struggle
[858.64 → 859.34] with this passage.
[859.60 → 860.24] I'm just going to invite you
[860.24 → 861.36] into my struggle of this week.
[862.24 → 863.90] This passage does not speak
[863.90 → 865.70] very directly into our context.
[866.32 → 867.42] We do not have people,
[867.50 → 868.38] as I already mentioned,
[868.62 → 869.48] going around,
[869.64 → 870.30] drawing attention
[870.30 → 871.02] to their fasting.
[871.48 → 872.62] We have very few people
[872.62 → 874.16] who are fasting at all.
[874.82 → 875.66] And those of us
[875.66 → 876.48] who are fasting,
[876.70 → 878.20] it's often not the kind of fasting
[878.20 → 878.96] we see in the scriptures.
[879.14 → 880.18] It's related to our health.
[880.28 → 881.34] It's related to losing weight.
[881.40 → 882.82] It's related to all other things.
[883.26 → 884.22] And those are not necessarily
[884.22 → 884.92] bad things.
[885.28 → 886.32] But it's not what we see
[886.32 → 886.88] in the scriptures.
[887.86 → 889.52] And I think what we struggle with,
[890.16 → 890.92] way differently
[890.92 → 891.74] than the Jewish people
[891.74 → 892.44] at this time is,
[892.70 → 894.14] whether we should fast.
[894.48 → 895.20] And if we fast,
[895.48 → 897.00] why do we fast?
[897.00 → 898.94] I think we need to spend time
[898.94 → 900.90] today as 21st century believers
[900.90 → 901.72] asking,
[902.22 → 903.38] what is the purpose
[903.38 → 904.92] of this practice?
[905.70 → 907.12] Jewish people then assumed
[907.12 → 908.58] that knowledge.
[909.12 → 910.42] We do not have it.
[911.44 → 912.46] And so I want to walk
[912.46 → 913.26] for a few minutes
[913.26 → 914.82] through some of the focus
[914.82 → 916.18] or some of the key ways
[916.18 → 917.14] that fasting was done.
[917.84 → 919.16] And there's more than one reason
[919.16 → 920.02] that people fasted
[920.02 → 920.52] in the scriptures.
[921.34 → 922.12] In fact, there's more
[922.12 → 922.86] than I'm even listing
[922.86 → 923.48] this morning.
[923.58 → 924.50] But I want to hone in
[924.50 → 926.16] on some of the key ways,
[926.26 → 927.84] the key reasons people fast
[927.84 → 928.70] in the scriptures
[928.70 → 930.54] and draw us into that purpose
[930.54 → 931.70] of why we should be
[931.70 → 932.32] giving ourselves
[932.32 → 933.16] to this practice.
[933.36 → 933.70] Are you ready?
[935.32 → 936.42] The first reason
[936.42 → 937.52] that we see in the scriptures
[937.52 → 938.60] for fasting
[938.60 → 940.24] is as Nana prayed,
[940.82 → 941.16] prayer.
[941.58 → 942.30] In fact, if you do
[942.30 → 943.02] a Google search
[943.02 → 943.92] throughout the Bible
[943.92 → 944.90] or a Logos search,
[944.96 → 945.64] if you have Logos,
[945.86 → 946.40] you'll see that
[946.40 → 946.96] whenever you see
[946.96 → 947.54] the word fasting
[947.54 → 948.02] or often,
[948.16 → 949.44] it's tied to prayer.
[950.52 → 951.44] They fasted
[951.44 → 952.92] and they prayed.
[953.04 → 953.58] That's a phrase
[953.58 → 954.68] we see all the time
[954.68 → 955.18] in the Old
[955.18 → 956.34] and in the New Testament.
[956.62 → 957.38] When people withheld
[957.38 → 958.40] food from their bodies,
[958.56 → 959.32] they gave themselves
[959.32 → 959.98] to prayer.
[960.90 → 961.88] Or as people say,
[961.96 → 963.78] we starve the flesh
[963.78 → 964.90] in order to feed
[964.90 → 966.10] on the life of God.
[966.90 → 968.92] We pray with our body.
[969.74 → 971.40] Fasting and prayer,
[971.48 → 972.38] they go together
[972.38 → 973.12] in the Bible.
[973.24 → 974.26] Those two things
[974.26 → 975.36] are hand and glove.
[975.44 → 977.68] The goal is being with God,
[977.92 → 978.68] seeking His will,
[978.84 → 979.60] being in His presence
[979.60 → 980.20] in prayer.
[980.20 → 981.78] And the kind of prayer
[981.78 → 983.02] that's most associated
[983.02 → 983.64] with fasting
[983.64 → 985.02] is confession
[985.02 → 986.86] and repentance.
[987.92 → 988.60] And just so you know,
[988.64 → 989.38] in the Old Testament,
[989.52 → 990.22] it's really important
[990.22 → 990.88] to see fasting
[990.88 → 992.12] not as first and foremost
[992.12 → 993.68] an individual practice,
[994.24 → 995.70] but as a corporate practice.
[996.38 → 997.10] When the Israelites
[997.10 → 998.22] would sin against God,
[998.30 → 999.20] when they would stand
[999.20 → 1000.20] against His laws,
[1000.46 → 1001.58] and they would be exposed
[1001.58 → 1002.48] by a prophet
[1002.48 → 1003.46] for the ways
[1003.46 → 1004.26] that they have been living,
[1004.48 → 1006.34] they would communally fast,
[1006.74 → 1008.18] and they would communally pray
[1008.18 → 1009.30] that God would forgive them.
[1009.30 → 1010.68] And that's a powerful thing.
[1011.50 → 1012.60] The whole community
[1012.60 → 1013.50] fasting together,
[1013.60 → 1013.78] saying,
[1013.98 → 1015.78] Father, have mercy.
[1016.60 → 1017.66] Change our hearts.
[1018.52 → 1020.46] Make us love your ways.
[1021.34 → 1022.86] Confession is central
[1022.86 → 1024.14] to the prayer
[1024.14 → 1024.94] that is associated
[1024.94 → 1025.62] with fasting
[1025.62 → 1026.70] in the Old Testament.
[1027.96 → 1029.58] So that's the first association.
[1029.78 → 1030.30] That's prayer
[1030.30 → 1031.84] that goes with fasting.
[1031.98 → 1032.86] Often the kind of prayer
[1032.86 → 1033.96] is confession and repentance.
[1034.12 → 1034.88] And that, by the way,
[1034.92 → 1035.50] is why fasting
[1035.50 → 1036.26] is very associated
[1036.26 → 1036.82] with Lent.
[1037.10 → 1038.22] It's a season of confession
[1038.22 → 1038.94] and preparation
[1038.94 → 1040.24] entering into Jesus'
[1040.38 → 1040.92] own experience
[1040.92 → 1041.94] of giving up His life.
[1043.32 → 1044.56] The second reason
[1044.56 → 1045.36] we see for fasting
[1045.36 → 1045.86] in the Scriptures
[1045.86 → 1047.44] is actually responding
[1047.44 → 1048.80] to calamity and death.
[1048.88 → 1049.16] In fact,
[1049.44 → 1050.64] I read a very interesting
[1050.64 → 1051.42] article this week
[1051.42 → 1052.46] on how that's actually
[1052.46 → 1053.50] the primary way
[1053.50 → 1054.50] we see fasting happen
[1054.50 → 1055.08] in the Old Testament.
[1056.28 → 1057.10] Often you see
[1057.10 → 1058.28] something terrible happen,
[1058.36 → 1058.64] whether it's
[1058.64 → 1059.58] a national tragedy
[1059.58 → 1060.80] or it's a corporate sin
[1060.80 → 1062.04] or some death happens,
[1062.22 → 1063.18] and people fast.
[1063.52 → 1063.92] You see this
[1063.92 → 1064.40] with King David.
[1064.48 → 1065.58] So often when something happens,
[1065.62 → 1066.34] like the death of his son,
[1066.34 → 1066.96] what does he do?
[1067.86 → 1068.86] He fasts
[1068.86 → 1070.02] and he prays.
[1070.06 → 1071.26] It's a response
[1071.26 → 1072.08] to the brokenness
[1072.08 → 1072.42] of the world.
[1072.52 → 1073.64] It's a way of responding
[1073.64 → 1074.32] to the way things
[1074.32 → 1075.06] are not the way
[1075.06 → 1075.88] they're supposed to be
[1075.88 → 1076.64] and taking that
[1076.64 → 1077.90] into prayer and lament.
[1079.36 → 1080.48] And maybe that's strange
[1080.48 → 1080.74] to you.
[1080.80 → 1081.70] It certainly feels strange
[1081.70 → 1082.64] to me that when something
[1082.64 → 1083.34] terrible happens,
[1083.44 → 1084.54] your response is fasting.
[1084.64 → 1086.68] That's not how I have grown up
[1086.68 → 1087.66] thinking about responding
[1087.66 → 1088.28] to crises.
[1088.74 → 1089.56] Maybe any of us.
[1090.12 → 1090.98] But let me ask,
[1091.80 → 1092.92] how do we respond
[1092.92 → 1095.00] to crises and calamity
[1095.00 → 1095.80] and the brokenness
[1095.80 → 1096.38] of our world?
[1096.60 → 1098.10] Do we even have tools
[1098.10 → 1099.26] in our own toolbox
[1099.26 → 1100.68] for responding appropriately?
[1101.76 → 1102.82] I would go further
[1102.82 → 1103.90] to say we don't,
[1104.12 → 1105.22] as Canadian people,
[1105.60 → 1107.26] know how to appropriately
[1107.26 → 1108.64] respond to the mess
[1108.64 → 1109.40] of our world.
[1109.92 → 1111.18] And our default reactions
[1111.18 → 1112.12] of just getting mad
[1112.12 → 1113.16] or taking to social media
[1113.16 → 1113.90] or just stuffing
[1113.90 → 1114.74] our emotions down,
[1114.94 → 1115.64] I don't think
[1115.64 → 1117.04] that's appropriate at all.
[1117.56 → 1118.18] And could it be
[1118.18 → 1119.58] that fasting is the tool
[1119.58 → 1120.90] that goes with prayer
[1120.90 → 1121.44] and lament?
[1121.60 → 1122.68] That is the appropriate
[1122.68 → 1125.48] response to the way
[1125.48 → 1126.04] that this world
[1126.04 → 1127.50] is not as it should be.
[1129.16 → 1130.28] Over the last two weeks,
[1131.00 → 1131.82] I've noticed actually
[1131.82 → 1132.86] in response to crises
[1132.86 → 1133.50] that the church
[1133.50 → 1134.86] is picking up this tool.
[1135.96 → 1136.48] Two weeks ago,
[1136.52 → 1137.24] a number of churches
[1137.24 → 1138.44] fasted and they prayed.
[1138.70 → 1139.16] And they prayed
[1139.16 → 1140.10] against racism,
[1140.76 → 1141.46] against Asians.
[1141.98 → 1143.06] That's on the rise
[1143.06 → 1144.06] because of the virus.
[1144.54 → 1145.54] That is an appropriate
[1145.54 → 1147.30] response to racism.
[1148.00 → 1148.80] This past week,
[1148.86 → 1149.48] after the shooting
[1149.48 → 1150.00] in Boulder,
[1150.00 → 1151.10] a number of churches
[1151.10 → 1151.70] in that city,
[1151.86 → 1153.52] they fasted, and they prayed
[1153.52 → 1154.34] against violence
[1154.34 → 1154.96] in their city.
[1155.98 → 1157.06] Violence to young people,
[1157.24 → 1158.00] violence to people
[1158.00 → 1159.26] who were unprotected.
[1159.84 → 1161.02] That is an appropriate
[1161.02 → 1162.86] response to the brokenness
[1162.86 → 1163.42] of this world.
[1163.80 → 1164.64] And it seems to me
[1164.64 → 1165.30] that the scriptures
[1165.30 → 1166.26] give us a gift
[1166.26 → 1168.36] in the task of fasting
[1168.36 → 1169.72] as we respond
[1169.72 → 1170.48] to the brokenness
[1170.48 → 1171.52] and the grievous sin
[1171.52 → 1172.78] that covers this creation.
[1174.68 → 1175.68] A third reason
[1175.68 → 1176.66] we see people fasting
[1176.66 → 1177.20] in the scriptures
[1177.20 → 1178.14] is actually related
[1178.14 → 1178.94] to justice
[1178.94 → 1180.64] and care for the poor.
[1180.72 → 1181.62] In Isaiah 58,
[1181.72 → 1182.72] we read that the fasting
[1182.72 → 1184.34] God desires from his people
[1184.34 → 1186.96] is mercy towards the oppressed.
[1188.02 → 1189.34] And I'm really struck
[1189.34 → 1190.86] in reading about the early church
[1190.86 → 1191.52] that oftentimes
[1191.52 → 1192.40] it was assumed
[1192.40 → 1193.48] that when you fasted,
[1193.86 → 1195.20] you would give your food
[1195.20 → 1196.32] that you would have eaten
[1196.32 → 1197.80] towards those in need.
[1198.60 → 1199.20] Isn't that intriguing?
[1199.62 → 1200.30] The assumption
[1200.30 → 1201.18] that if you fast,
[1201.24 → 1202.04] it's going to be connected
[1202.04 → 1202.64] to hospitality
[1202.64 → 1203.36] and generosity
[1203.36 → 1204.22] to the least of these
[1204.22 → 1205.04] and you will give your food
[1205.04 → 1206.16] or you will give the money
[1206.16 → 1206.70] you would spend
[1206.70 → 1207.24] towards your food
[1207.24 → 1208.20] towards those
[1208.20 → 1208.84] who are in need.
[1209.00 → 1210.30] Fasting is associated
[1210.30 → 1211.06] and tied to
[1211.06 → 1212.44] care for the oppressed.
[1214.82 → 1215.84] The fourth reason
[1215.84 → 1216.76] we see for fasting
[1216.76 → 1217.38] in the scriptures
[1217.38 → 1219.32] is discerning God's will
[1219.32 → 1220.54] in times of decision-making.
[1220.68 → 1221.20] And I'm guessing
[1221.20 → 1222.54] that many of you,
[1222.66 → 1223.90] if you have tried fasting,
[1224.44 → 1225.32] it's because you have
[1225.32 → 1227.28] a major life decision
[1227.28 → 1227.70] to make.
[1227.76 → 1228.58] That's certainly the door
[1228.58 → 1229.64] that brought me into fasting.
[1229.76 → 1230.54] I wanted to make sure
[1230.54 → 1231.66] I wasn't making a mistake
[1231.66 → 1232.92] in major decisions
[1232.92 → 1234.10] and I fasted
[1234.10 → 1234.60] and I prayed
[1234.60 → 1235.30] so that I would have
[1235.30 → 1235.86] some clarity.
[1237.82 → 1238.72] Fasting seems
[1238.72 → 1240.44] to sharpen our minds
[1240.44 → 1241.24] to the voice
[1241.24 → 1241.98] of the Holy Spirit.
[1243.04 → 1243.68] And many people,
[1243.82 → 1244.26] including Dan
[1244.26 → 1245.26] I've talked to about this,
[1245.54 → 1246.64] have said that fasting
[1246.64 → 1248.64] is that clarifying practice
[1248.64 → 1250.78] where we are listening well
[1250.78 → 1253.08] to the God who does speak.
[1253.94 → 1255.06] We are listening well
[1255.06 → 1255.74] to the Father
[1255.74 → 1256.74] who does love us
[1256.74 → 1258.18] and seek to guide us.
[1258.48 → 1259.06] And I want to read
[1259.06 → 1259.54] for you words
[1259.54 → 1260.76] from Acts 13.2.
[1260.86 → 1261.54] They will be up
[1261.54 → 1262.54] on the screen, I think.
[1262.92 → 1263.92] And this is what we read
[1263.92 → 1264.66] in that passage.
[1266.26 → 1267.60] While they were worshipping
[1267.60 → 1269.40] the Lord and fasting,
[1270.08 → 1271.38] the Holy Spirit said,
[1271.52 → 1272.26] Set apart for me
[1272.26 → 1273.40] Barnabas and Saul
[1273.40 → 1274.12] for the work
[1274.12 → 1275.64] which I have called them to.
[1276.46 → 1278.10] So after they had fasted
[1278.10 → 1278.90] and they prayed,
[1279.54 → 1280.88] they placed their hands
[1280.88 → 1282.30] on them and sent them off.
[1283.56 → 1284.24] Did you hear that?
[1285.52 → 1286.66] As they worshipped
[1286.66 → 1288.04] and fasted and prayed,
[1288.16 → 1289.64] the Holy Spirit spoke.
[1290.16 → 1291.16] And then as they fasted,
[1291.22 → 1291.92] they sent off
[1291.92 → 1292.88] Paul and Barnabas
[1292.88 → 1293.82] to the missionary work
[1293.82 → 1294.74] that God had called them to.
[1295.06 → 1296.38] The context is critical.
[1296.76 → 1297.80] It is not accidental
[1297.80 → 1298.78] that they were worshipping,
[1299.12 → 1299.94] fasting, and praying.
[1300.16 → 1301.12] And it's in that context
[1301.12 → 1302.34] that they heard the Spirit say,
[1302.66 → 1303.60] These two people,
[1303.94 → 1304.88] Paul and Barnabas,
[1305.56 → 1306.56] send them.
[1307.40 → 1308.80] I have work for them
[1308.80 → 1309.48] in other cities.
[1310.84 → 1311.34] Fasting
[1311.34 → 1312.94] was the practice
[1312.94 → 1313.64] of the church
[1313.64 → 1315.00] to discern
[1315.00 → 1316.28] God's will
[1316.28 → 1317.60] in a critical time
[1317.60 → 1318.74] in the expansion
[1318.74 → 1319.40] of the church.
[1321.50 → 1322.92] Don't you want that?
[1324.20 → 1325.42] Don't you want to know
[1325.42 → 1326.90] what God's mind is
[1326.90 → 1327.84] for key decisions
[1327.84 → 1328.62] in your life
[1328.62 → 1329.72] and your family
[1329.72 → 1330.82] and all the decisions
[1330.82 → 1331.38] of work?
[1331.70 → 1332.64] I find that this is
[1332.64 → 1333.68] a very compelling
[1333.68 → 1335.18] pull for me.
[1336.36 → 1337.36] Even when Brittany and I
[1337.36 → 1338.28] were discerning
[1338.28 → 1339.38] whether to leave
[1339.38 → 1340.06] our previous church
[1340.06 → 1340.68] and come to Hope,
[1340.72 → 1341.76] that was a hard decision
[1341.76 → 1342.26] for us.
[1342.68 → 1343.68] We were part of a good church.
[1343.78 → 1344.66] We loved that church.
[1344.96 → 1345.84] We were well-loved
[1345.84 → 1346.66] by the church
[1346.66 → 1347.78] and then this church
[1347.78 → 1348.30] Hope community
[1348.30 → 1349.16] seemed to be interested
[1349.16 → 1350.38] in this pastor here
[1350.38 → 1351.24] and we went into
[1351.24 → 1352.22] the season of discernment.
[1353.14 → 1353.84] And what I learned
[1353.84 → 1355.42] in that experience
[1355.42 → 1355.98] of fasting
[1355.98 → 1357.12] was that fasting
[1357.12 → 1358.50] clarified my motives.
[1359.08 → 1360.16] Did I hear God say,
[1360.72 → 1361.08] Hope?
[1361.82 → 1362.58] Not quite.
[1363.16 → 1364.52] But I did hear God say,
[1365.08 → 1365.98] Bad reasons.
[1367.10 → 1368.76] And sort this out.
[1370.02 → 1371.34] And our hearts
[1371.34 → 1373.16] are incredibly deceptive.
[1373.90 → 1374.86] In major decisions
[1374.86 → 1375.24] we make,
[1375.24 → 1376.00] there are all sorts
[1376.00 → 1376.54] of dimensions
[1376.54 → 1377.30] to that decision
[1377.30 → 1377.82] that we need
[1377.82 → 1378.66] to be attentive to.
[1379.48 → 1380.20] Are we moving
[1380.20 → 1381.26] because it's easier?
[1381.86 → 1382.78] Are we making changes
[1382.78 → 1383.98] because we'll get more money?
[1384.32 → 1385.28] Is this in line
[1385.28 → 1386.88] with the kingdom of God?
[1387.72 → 1388.30] And pastors
[1388.30 → 1389.28] are just as susceptible
[1389.28 → 1390.48] to all these temptations
[1390.48 → 1391.34] as the rest of us.
[1392.12 → 1392.84] And so in the end
[1392.84 → 1393.90] we felt called to hope
[1393.90 → 1395.10] not because it was easier,
[1395.62 → 1396.88] because it was way harder.
[1397.46 → 1397.96] I'm just kidding.
[1399.10 → 1400.10] We felt called
[1400.10 → 1401.14] because God clarified
[1401.14 → 1401.76] our motives
[1401.76 → 1403.30] and there was a guiding
[1403.30 → 1404.28] into this community
[1404.28 → 1405.14] and we thank the Lord
[1405.14 → 1405.72] for that.
[1407.06 → 1408.10] Perhaps you're in that season
[1408.10 → 1408.70] right now.
[1409.62 → 1410.68] You've got major decisions
[1410.68 → 1411.58] to make as a family,
[1411.66 → 1412.18] as an individual,
[1412.34 → 1413.34] with work, vocation,
[1413.42 → 1414.10] where you live.
[1414.46 → 1415.60] This is a tool
[1415.60 → 1417.26] given to the church
[1417.26 → 1419.22] so that we can gain clarity
[1419.22 → 1420.90] and listen to our Father
[1420.90 → 1421.58] who speaks,
[1422.32 → 1423.04] who guides,
[1423.56 → 1424.62] who wants to direct
[1424.62 → 1425.44] our path.
[1425.44 → 1428.60] Fifthly,
[1429.90 → 1431.02] fasting is done
[1431.02 → 1432.10] as a means of calling
[1432.10 → 1433.44] on God to act.
[1434.34 → 1435.14] It is a way of saying,
[1435.22 → 1436.58] God, you see this injustice,
[1436.82 → 1438.04] you see this wrongdoing,
[1438.16 → 1439.44] we want you to do something,
[1439.56 → 1440.74] we want you to bring about change,
[1440.82 → 1442.04] we want you to intervene
[1442.04 → 1443.40] because you are God.
[1444.28 → 1446.06] And I realize in saying this
[1446.06 → 1446.92] that I'm disagreeing
[1446.92 → 1447.56] with some scholars.
[1447.98 → 1448.82] I think I'm confident
[1448.82 → 1449.44] enough to do that.
[1449.54 → 1450.02] Some say,
[1450.18 → 1450.78] you're turning God
[1450.78 → 1452.16] into a cosmic slot machine.
[1452.72 → 1454.20] You're trying to manipulate God.
[1454.20 → 1455.06] You have a desire,
[1455.38 → 1456.04] you call on God
[1456.04 → 1456.64] to do something.
[1456.76 → 1457.64] And I do not think
[1457.64 → 1458.24] for a second
[1458.24 → 1459.80] that this is turning God
[1459.80 → 1460.70] into a slot machine
[1460.70 → 1461.84] where you're trying
[1461.84 → 1462.68] to manipulate Him
[1462.68 → 1463.56] to do what you want.
[1464.26 → 1465.46] I think this kind of fasting
[1465.46 → 1465.84] and prayer,
[1465.90 → 1466.34] and we see this
[1466.34 → 1467.04] in the book of Jonah,
[1467.54 → 1468.32] is calling on God
[1468.32 → 1469.74] to relent or to act
[1469.74 → 1471.24] in accordance with His will,
[1471.30 → 1472.46] in accordance with His kingdom
[1472.46 → 1474.00] so that His will be done.
[1474.74 → 1475.34] And to the degree
[1475.34 → 1476.00] that you fast
[1476.00 → 1477.02] and try to manipulate Him,
[1477.30 → 1478.26] I don't think He can be
[1478.26 → 1479.28] manipulated like that.
[1479.36 → 1480.20] He's God.
[1481.50 → 1482.32] But there is a sense
[1482.32 → 1483.44] in which God invites us,
[1483.44 → 1484.54] and this is a powerful thing
[1484.54 → 1485.38] and a mysterious thing.
[1485.50 → 1486.76] God invites us,
[1486.84 → 1488.08] as children He loves,
[1488.66 → 1490.52] to pray and to fast
[1490.52 → 1492.22] and ask for His kingdom
[1492.22 → 1492.88] to come
[1492.88 → 1494.46] in powerful,
[1494.84 → 1496.04] tangible ways.
[1496.94 → 1497.62] And the church
[1497.62 → 1498.70] can see that happen
[1498.70 → 1500.40] as they fast and pray.
[1500.50 → 1500.98] Last week,
[1501.32 → 1502.34] I think I mentioned
[1502.34 → 1503.92] how in cities
[1503.92 → 1504.50] where there were
[1504.50 → 1506.00] transformation and conversions,
[1506.72 → 1507.80] places where revival
[1507.80 → 1508.44] took place,
[1508.84 → 1509.92] a common thread
[1509.92 → 1510.62] in those cities
[1510.62 → 1512.02] was people
[1512.02 → 1513.44] so tired of sin,
[1513.84 → 1515.70] so tired of compromised churches,
[1515.88 → 1516.80] that they were crying out,
[1516.88 → 1517.52] they were fasting,
[1517.74 → 1518.38] and praying
[1518.38 → 1519.82] that God would show up,
[1520.34 → 1521.12] that He would break
[1521.12 → 1521.74] people's hearts,
[1521.82 → 1522.62] that they would confess
[1522.62 → 1523.08] their sin
[1523.08 → 1523.96] and come to Jesus.
[1524.36 → 1525.44] And lo and behold,
[1526.08 → 1526.62] in the cities
[1526.62 → 1527.74] where people were confessing,
[1528.18 → 1528.48] fasting,
[1528.72 → 1529.30] and praying,
[1530.16 → 1531.04] revivals happened.
[1531.04 → 1534.38] What a powerful tool,
[1535.10 → 1536.18] this thing of fasting.
[1539.58 → 1540.98] I want to spend some time
[1540.98 → 1541.86] now sharing
[1541.86 → 1543.86] what I've actually learned
[1543.86 → 1544.72] mostly from people
[1544.72 → 1545.88] who fast regularly.
[1546.96 → 1547.66] And I think this is
[1547.66 → 1548.62] the contextualizing
[1548.62 → 1549.60] to our own context
[1549.60 → 1550.12] for fasting.
[1550.22 → 1550.98] I think fasting
[1550.98 → 1552.06] is one of the most
[1552.06 → 1553.26] powerful ways
[1553.26 → 1554.92] we learn
[1554.92 → 1557.04] to be disciples
[1557.04 → 1558.62] who deny ourselves.
[1558.62 → 1560.46] we learn
[1560.46 → 1561.50] how to say
[1561.50 → 1562.46] no.
[1563.22 → 1564.24] And I'm well aware,
[1564.40 → 1565.62] as you probably are too,
[1565.70 → 1566.72] that we live in a culture
[1566.72 → 1568.22] that wants us
[1568.22 → 1568.98] to say yes
[1568.98 → 1570.28] to everything.
[1571.20 → 1572.40] And we live in a culture
[1572.40 → 1573.76] of incredible
[1573.76 → 1575.04] excess.
[1576.10 → 1576.44] In fact,
[1576.48 → 1576.92] I've heard from
[1576.92 → 1577.80] more than one person
[1577.80 → 1579.08] who's come from
[1579.08 → 1580.08] a different part of the world
[1580.08 → 1581.46] that is not nearly
[1581.46 → 1582.54] as wealthy as Canada,
[1582.88 → 1583.72] and they walk
[1583.72 → 1584.90] through a grocery store,
[1585.46 → 1586.84] and they just cannot
[1586.84 → 1587.86] believe
[1587.86 → 1589.74] the excess
[1589.74 → 1591.04] of food.
[1591.70 → 1592.66] That we have
[1592.66 → 1594.48] 60 cereals,
[1595.82 → 1597.28] 70 sauces
[1597.28 → 1599.50] for just hamburgers,
[1599.80 → 1600.68] not even to mention
[1600.68 → 1601.34] other sauces
[1601.34 → 1602.18] for other foods.
[1602.24 → 1602.92] It's excessive,
[1603.16 → 1603.78] and that's just
[1603.78 → 1605.22] one part of society.
[1605.62 → 1606.56] We are in excess
[1606.56 → 1607.24] with our media.
[1607.36 → 1608.34] We have more shows
[1608.34 → 1608.80] on Netflix
[1608.80 → 1609.58] and all the other
[1609.58 → 1610.12] streaming devices
[1610.12 → 1611.24] than we could ever watch
[1611.24 → 1611.98] in our lifetime.
[1612.56 → 1613.44] More options
[1613.44 → 1614.52] for what cell phone
[1614.52 → 1615.22] and what media
[1615.22 → 1615.94] and internet you use.
[1616.00 → 1616.74] It's ridiculous
[1616.74 → 1618.06] how much excess
[1618.06 → 1618.40] we have
[1618.40 → 1619.60] in every part
[1619.60 → 1620.30] of our life.
[1621.24 → 1622.42] Not to mention
[1622.42 → 1623.82] that the dominant
[1623.82 → 1625.54] narrative of culture
[1625.54 → 1627.68] is enjoyed it.
[1628.72 → 1630.14] Do what you want.
[1631.14 → 1631.70] Indulge
[1631.70 → 1633.44] in all the options
[1633.44 → 1634.00] you have.
[1634.12 → 1635.02] Try it out.
[1635.38 → 1636.20] Seize the day.
[1636.66 → 1637.60] That's the narrative
[1637.60 → 1638.98] at work in our culture.
[1638.98 → 1641.68] What a powerful tool
[1641.68 → 1642.74] fasting is
[1642.74 → 1645.18] to say no.
[1646.70 → 1647.68] To say no
[1647.68 → 1649.76] and learn what it means
[1649.76 → 1650.92] to deny ourselves.
[1651.80 → 1652.26] I want to read
[1652.26 → 1653.22] what one writer says.
[1653.38 → 1654.20] His name is Jerry Slim.
[1654.28 → 1655.08] I've quoted him before
[1655.08 → 1655.64] in this series.
[1656.10 → 1656.48] He writes,
[1656.62 → 1657.68] Fasting is a tool
[1657.68 → 1658.68] that exercises
[1658.68 → 1659.60] the muscle
[1659.60 → 1661.40] of no in your life.
[1662.50 → 1663.34] It's an exercise
[1663.34 → 1664.76] that gives you reps
[1664.76 → 1666.72] in self-denial.
[1666.72 → 1668.60] And I happen to believe
[1668.60 → 1669.88] that we as a church
[1669.88 → 1671.90] are desperately in need
[1671.90 → 1672.52] of reps
[1672.52 → 1673.96] in self-denial.
[1674.20 → 1674.72] And I say that
[1674.72 → 1675.70] for myself as well.
[1677.38 → 1678.20] In conversation
[1678.20 → 1679.20] with other pastors
[1679.20 → 1680.44] and other people,
[1680.56 → 1680.84] friends,
[1681.00 → 1681.70] even family members
[1681.70 → 1682.66] who fast regularly,
[1683.30 → 1684.46] a recurring theme
[1684.46 → 1685.08] about fasting
[1685.08 → 1685.92] that I want to share about
[1685.92 → 1687.12] is how when people fast,
[1687.24 → 1688.58] God seems to surface
[1688.58 → 1689.24] idols.
[1690.18 → 1690.98] He seems to surface
[1690.98 → 1691.68] whatever it is
[1691.68 → 1692.42] that you struggle with.
[1692.54 → 1693.60] Fasting seems to bring
[1693.60 → 1694.74] that to the mind.
[1695.44 → 1696.70] If anger is your idol,
[1696.94 → 1698.10] fasting will surface that.
[1700.40 → 1701.20] Let me think of
[1701.20 → 1701.80] a bunch of others.
[1702.04 → 1703.20] If compulsiveness
[1703.20 → 1704.06] is your idol,
[1704.84 → 1705.88] fasting will surface that.
[1706.52 → 1707.92] If you have some kind
[1707.92 → 1708.38] of addiction,
[1708.70 → 1709.16] sexual,
[1709.36 → 1709.68] alcohol,
[1709.82 → 1710.16] or others,
[1710.36 → 1711.80] fasting will surface that.
[1711.92 → 1713.22] And if food is your idol,
[1713.42 → 1714.30] you can bet
[1714.30 → 1715.20] that fasting
[1715.20 → 1716.52] will surface that.
[1717.22 → 1718.04] And I happen to think
[1718.04 → 1718.52] as well
[1718.52 → 1719.44] that many of us
[1719.44 → 1720.46] have never learned
[1720.46 → 1721.42] to even say no
[1721.42 → 1722.44] to food.
[1724.00 → 1724.82] Fasting brings
[1724.82 → 1725.50] to the surface
[1725.50 → 1726.98] the idols of our lives
[1726.98 → 1728.04] and allows us
[1728.04 → 1728.68] to face them
[1728.68 → 1729.56] for what they are.
[1730.02 → 1731.62] What a gift this is.
[1731.94 → 1732.92] And as one person said to me,
[1732.98 → 1733.92] the point isn't simply
[1733.92 → 1734.58] not to eat.
[1734.82 → 1735.70] It's what to do
[1735.70 → 1736.70] with the stuff
[1736.70 → 1737.76] that fasting
[1737.76 → 1738.42] will surface
[1738.42 → 1739.60] in your life.
[1741.40 → 1742.70] I read a story this week
[1742.70 → 1743.26] of a pastor
[1743.26 → 1744.28] who leads a group
[1744.28 → 1744.80] of people,
[1745.84 → 1746.52] many of whom
[1746.52 → 1747.04] would say that
[1747.04 → 1747.66] they are addicted
[1747.66 → 1748.88] to one sexual thing
[1748.88 → 1749.32] or another.
[1749.98 → 1750.64] Most of the time
[1750.64 → 1751.12] it's porn.
[1752.12 → 1753.00] And what he's learned
[1753.00 → 1754.04] through his own practice
[1754.04 → 1754.60] of fasting
[1754.60 → 1756.12] is that one of the first things
[1756.12 → 1756.94] they do as a group
[1756.94 → 1758.54] is fast.
[1759.36 → 1760.20] And they learn
[1760.20 → 1761.08] how to say no
[1761.08 → 1761.74] to food.
[1762.42 → 1763.30] And as they learn
[1763.30 → 1763.82] how to fast
[1763.82 → 1764.44] and they practice
[1764.44 → 1765.42] on a regular basis,
[1765.80 → 1766.48] what he's noticed
[1766.48 → 1768.14] almost normally
[1768.14 → 1769.50] or almost in organic ways
[1769.50 → 1770.34] is that as people
[1770.34 → 1770.88] in this group
[1770.88 → 1772.24] learn to fast from food,
[1772.96 → 1773.68] they learn
[1773.68 → 1774.96] that they are able
[1774.96 → 1776.62] by the Spirit's power
[1776.62 → 1777.36] to say no
[1777.36 → 1778.26] to other things
[1778.26 → 1778.74] as well.
[1779.56 → 1780.10] There's a sense
[1780.10 → 1780.84] in which once
[1780.84 → 1781.38] they can say no
[1781.38 → 1781.96] to the stomach
[1781.96 → 1782.48] they've learned,
[1782.68 → 1782.84] hey,
[1783.56 → 1784.46] I can say no
[1784.46 → 1785.34] to other stuff
[1785.34 → 1786.58] that is destructive
[1786.58 → 1787.92] and dehumanizing
[1787.92 → 1788.48] as well.
[1788.82 → 1789.68] And they sense
[1789.68 → 1790.62] through this practice
[1790.62 → 1791.96] the Spirit at work
[1791.96 → 1792.70] moving,
[1793.02 → 1793.28] shaping,
[1793.56 → 1794.00] developing
[1794.00 → 1794.90] to people
[1794.90 → 1795.86] being in the ability,
[1796.00 → 1796.70] people saying
[1796.70 → 1798.06] no.
[1799.44 → 1799.96] Learning
[1799.96 → 1801.52] self-denial.
[1801.66 → 1802.38] And I really think
[1802.38 → 1803.80] that this is a central dimension
[1803.80 → 1805.40] for the church today
[1805.40 → 1806.56] in excessive
[1806.56 → 1807.22] say yes
[1807.22 → 1807.90] to whatever you want
[1807.90 → 1808.66] culture of Canada,
[1809.06 → 1809.94] learning self-denial,
[1810.16 → 1811.38] fasting will be that tool.
[1811.70 → 1812.60] It will be that gift
[1812.60 → 1813.24] to the church
[1813.24 → 1814.48] of Jesus today.
[1817.52 → 1817.96] Now,
[1818.04 → 1818.82] I don't want this sermon
[1818.82 → 1820.16] to be an information dump
[1820.16 → 1821.10] on fasting,
[1821.26 → 1822.44] just another spiritual discipline
[1822.44 → 1822.94] where you learn
[1822.94 → 1823.68] a few facts.
[1824.18 → 1824.98] I want us
[1824.98 → 1826.06] to practice this.
[1826.76 → 1828.04] And I am unashamedly
[1828.04 → 1829.28] inviting every single one
[1829.28 → 1829.72] of us
[1829.72 → 1831.70] to fast this Wednesday.
[1832.46 → 1833.22] From Wednesday
[1833.22 → 1834.06] till Thursday,
[1834.20 → 1834.72] Thursday we have
[1834.72 → 1835.80] a Mandy Thursday service.
[1835.94 → 1836.38] We are going to have
[1836.38 → 1837.72] communion during that service.
[1837.84 → 1838.90] And what we want to do
[1838.90 → 1840.86] is fast from Wednesday
[1840.86 → 1841.64] all the way
[1841.64 → 1842.58] till communion
[1842.58 → 1844.26] on our Mandy Thursday service.
[1844.34 → 1844.74] And here's what
[1844.74 → 1845.50] I'm going to invite you to do.
[1845.70 → 1846.76] I want you to already
[1846.76 → 1847.44] think creatively
[1847.44 → 1848.44] about how to turn
[1848.44 → 1849.40] the Lord's Supper
[1849.40 → 1850.82] into a real meal
[1850.82 → 1851.42] in your homes.
[1851.90 → 1852.72] I'm convinced
[1852.72 → 1853.44] and other people
[1853.44 → 1853.94] agree with me
[1853.94 → 1854.62] that when we did,
[1854.74 → 1855.36] when the early church
[1855.36 → 1855.94] did Lord's Supper
[1855.94 → 1857.26] it was not this tiny cube
[1857.26 → 1857.72] of bread
[1857.72 → 1859.02] and this
[1859.02 → 1860.78] now medical container,
[1861.02 → 1861.84] no offence to candy,
[1861.94 → 1863.28] these medical sanitized
[1863.28 → 1863.70] containers
[1863.70 → 1864.76] of juice.
[1865.38 → 1866.62] I think it was a meal.
[1866.82 → 1867.74] It was a good
[1867.74 → 1868.82] hearty meal
[1868.82 → 1869.60] and what a beautiful
[1869.60 → 1870.20] thing for us
[1870.20 → 1871.28] to as a community
[1871.28 → 1872.42] fast from Wednesday
[1872.42 → 1874.46] till we feast
[1874.46 → 1875.58] on Thursday.
[1875.96 → 1876.62] And if this is your
[1876.62 → 1877.20] first time,
[1877.32 → 1877.96] stay hydrated.
[1878.46 → 1879.22] If you don't want
[1879.22 → 1879.74] to have a headache,
[1879.86 → 1880.72] don't cut out coffee
[1880.72 → 1881.82] the first time you fast
[1881.82 → 1882.90] and use it.
[1882.96 → 1883.98] This is an important piece
[1883.98 → 1885.82] as a means of prayer.
[1887.56 → 1888.48] Allow the Spirit
[1888.48 → 1889.10] to speak.
[1889.44 → 1889.96] Take time,
[1890.04 → 1891.02] whether it's your lunch break,
[1891.02 → 1892.36] your times throughout the day,
[1892.52 → 1893.18] mark off times
[1893.18 → 1894.16] where you just are in prayer,
[1894.64 → 1895.28] you're listening,
[1895.58 → 1896.10] you're speaking,
[1896.30 → 1897.14] you're confessing
[1897.14 → 1898.56] and then bring that
[1898.56 → 1899.38] to Monday, Thursday
[1899.38 → 1900.78] where we celebrate
[1900.78 → 1901.68] communion together.
[1902.00 → 1902.46] Sound good?
[1903.08 → 1903.60] We're all in?
[1904.44 → 1905.28] Val will be sending you
[1905.28 → 1906.00] an email with some
[1906.00 → 1906.58] other resources
[1906.58 → 1907.42] and ways you can do
[1907.42 → 1907.90] this fast
[1907.90 → 1908.96] but we really do want
[1908.96 → 1909.90] all of us
[1909.90 → 1911.42] as Hope Community Church
[1911.42 → 1913.46] to practice fasting.
[1913.96 → 1914.62] And then as a family
[1914.62 → 1915.26] you can debrief
[1915.26 → 1915.82] what it was like,
[1915.88 → 1916.50] how hard it was,
[1916.60 → 1917.26] what God said,
[1917.36 → 1919.08] how you're shaped by it.
[1919.08 → 1922.16] Let me conclude
[1922.16 → 1922.80] with a prayer
[1922.80 → 1924.66] that someone else wrote
[1924.66 → 1925.56] as an encouragement
[1925.56 → 1926.80] when people begin
[1926.80 → 1927.84] their fasts.
[1928.54 → 1929.52] This is a prayer
[1929.52 → 1930.18] that we'll conclude
[1930.18 → 1930.92] this sermon with.
[1933.32 → 1934.38] Father God,
[1935.04 → 1936.52] we really want
[1936.52 → 1937.48] to be transformed
[1937.48 → 1939.02] to be like Jesus.
[1940.36 → 1942.10] He loved the world
[1942.10 → 1943.26] and carried the kingdom
[1943.26 → 1943.74] of God
[1943.74 → 1944.68] wherever He went.
[1945.82 → 1947.32] We know we're nothing
[1947.32 → 1948.02] like Him
[1948.02 → 1949.34] on our own.
[1950.40 → 1951.24] We also know
[1951.24 → 1952.36] that You have given us
[1952.36 → 1953.32] the Holy Spirit
[1953.32 → 1955.26] so that we can change
[1955.26 → 1956.70] and become more
[1956.70 → 1957.88] who You have designed
[1957.88 → 1958.54] us to be.
[1959.62 → 1960.32] We pray
[1960.32 → 1963.12] that You would use
[1963.12 → 1963.92] our fasting
[1963.92 → 1965.66] to help us
[1965.66 → 1967.06] live into this world
[1967.06 → 1968.98] as it really is.
[1969.82 → 1970.98] In Jesus Christ
[1970.98 → 1971.52] we pray.
[1972.52 → 1972.88] Amen.
[1972.88 → 1973.04] Amen.
[1973.04 → 1977.28] In just a moment
[1977.28 → 1977.88] we are going
[1977.88 → 1978.62] to celebrate
[1978.62 → 1979.98] communion together
[1979.98 → 1981.54] and I invite you now
[1981.54 → 1982.54] who've got young kids
[1982.54 → 1983.22] or if your elements
[1983.22 → 1983.70] are in the kitchen
[1983.70 → 1984.30] to bring them
[1984.30 → 1985.50] into the living room
[1985.50 → 1986.22] or wherever you are
[1986.22 → 1987.18] watching this service.
[1988.40 → 1989.32] And as is before
[1989.32 → 1990.26] we're going to take time
[1990.26 → 1991.26] to confess our sin
[1991.26 → 1992.56] before we come
[1992.56 → 1993.08] to the table.
[1994.68 → 1995.72] I learned this week
[1995.72 → 1996.64] that the early church
[1996.64 → 1997.86] often fasted
[1997.86 → 1999.16] leading up to the meal.
[1999.16 → 2000.88] that the time
[2000.88 → 2001.50] of preparation
[2001.50 → 2002.36] for the Lord's Supper
[2002.36 → 2003.34] was fasting,
[2003.66 → 2004.20] confessing,
[2004.28 → 2004.68] and praying
[2004.68 → 2005.52] and we in our own way
[2005.52 → 2006.08] are going to do that
[2006.08 → 2006.60] this morning.
[2007.36 → 2008.42] But more importantly
[2008.42 → 2009.12] what struck me
[2009.12 → 2010.06] about many churches
[2010.06 → 2011.32] that I read about
[2011.32 → 2012.86] was that the central
[2012.86 → 2013.72] celebration
[2013.72 → 2015.28] was the feast.
[2016.56 → 2017.18] The table
[2017.18 → 2017.98] is the place
[2017.98 → 2019.18] where we remember
[2019.18 → 2020.10] and we believe
[2020.10 → 2021.44] what Jesus Christ
[2021.44 → 2022.64] did once and for all
[2022.64 → 2023.88] for His world,
[2024.62 → 2025.42] for His church,
[2025.98 → 2026.86] and for you.
[2028.34 → 2029.06] And so this morning
[2029.06 → 2030.24] we centre ourselves
[2030.24 → 2030.68] again
[2030.68 → 2031.90] on the reality
[2031.90 → 2033.16] that Jesus has come,
[2033.76 → 2034.76] that He has conquered
[2034.76 → 2036.54] and He is coming again.
[2037.42 → 2038.38] In this time
[2038.38 → 2039.94] I do invite you
[2039.94 → 2040.64] as you are comfortable
[2040.64 → 2042.04] to confess out loud
[2042.04 → 2043.84] and spend time
[2043.84 → 2045.20] bringing your true self
[2045.20 → 2046.02] before the Father
[2046.02 → 2047.44] before we receive
[2047.44 → 2048.02] the grace
[2048.02 → 2049.00] in this meal.
[2049.08 → 2049.74] Let's pray together.
[2049.74 → 2049.86] Amen.
[2049.86 → 2049.92] Amen.
[2049.92 → 2051.86] Amen.
[2051.86 → 2051.92] Amen.
[2051.92 → 2052.00] Amen.
[2052.00 → 2052.06] Amen.
[2052.06 → 2052.28] Amen.
[2052.28 → 2052.36] Amen.
[2052.36 → 2052.42] Amen.
[2052.42 → 2052.52] Amen.
[2052.52 → 2052.56] Amen.
[2059.06 → 2067.34] Amen.
[2067.56 → 2068.24] Amen.
[2068.24 → 2068.44] Amen.
[2068.44 → 2084.06] Amen.
[2084.06 → 2086.64] Amen.
[2087.18 → 2087.78] Amen.
[2087.78 → 2089.78] Amen.
[2117.78 → 2119.78] Amen.
[2147.78 → 2149.78] Amen.
[2177.78 → 2179.78] Amen.
[2207.78 → 2209.78] Amen.
[2229.78 → 2233.22] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just,
[2233.22 → 2238.76] and will forgive us of all our sins and purify us of all unrighteousness.
[2239.80 → 2243.64] Brothers and sisters, we are approaching this morning the table of grace,
[2245.34 → 2253.02] remembering the moment where God gave up his son for us.
[2255.04 → 2259.52] And Jesus, when he was with his disciples in that upper room,
[2260.02 → 2262.88] took ordinary bread that was part of a Passover meal,
[2263.22 → 2265.90] and he made a statement that confused his disciples,
[2266.44 → 2269.04] because for them, this reminded them of the Exodus,
[2269.60 → 2272.16] fleeing Egypt, being freed by God.
[2272.72 → 2273.60] And Jesus said to them,
[2274.54 → 2275.98] this is my body.
[2276.80 → 2279.04] Do this in remembrance of me.
[2280.16 → 2280.98] In the same way,
[2281.64 → 2282.60] Jesus took this cup
[2282.60 → 2285.84] that they had always celebrated Passover with
[2285.84 → 2288.24] to remember that they put blood on their doorpost,
[2288.40 → 2290.76] and that protected them from God's judgment.
[2290.76 → 2293.48] And Jesus said another strange thing to them.
[2293.48 → 2293.80] He said,
[2293.98 → 2295.74] this is my blood,
[2296.54 → 2298.84] poured out for the forgiveness of sins.
[2299.90 → 2302.48] It was not until after his resurrection
[2302.48 → 2306.22] that they realized that Jesus was talking about the cross,
[2306.64 → 2309.22] the place where he would defeat sin,
[2309.22 → 2312.44] he would give up all things
[2312.44 → 2316.10] so that we and our world would be set free and liberated.
[2317.68 → 2319.02] So I invite you,
[2320.08 → 2322.60] as the family of God who believes in Jesus,
[2323.44 → 2324.32] to take,
[2325.18 → 2325.50] eat,
[2326.30 → 2326.70] remember,
[2326.84 → 2327.50] and believe
[2327.50 → 2328.78] that Jesus,
[2328.78 → 2328.80] that Jesus,
[2329.14 → 2329.88] our Lamb,
[2331.00 → 2332.02] gave up his life
[2332.02 → 2333.20] for the complete forgiveness
[2333.20 → 2334.88] of all our sins.
[2334.88 → 2353.34] brothers and sisters,
[2353.52 → 2353.78] take,
[2354.28 → 2354.78] drink,
[2356.04 → 2356.44] remember,
[2356.58 → 2357.14] and believe
[2357.14 → 2358.90] that the blood of Jesus
[2358.90 → 2360.36] was poured out
[2360.36 → 2361.86] for the complete forgiveness
[2361.86 → 2363.50] of all our sins.
[2363.50 → 2377.12] would you pray with me?
[2381.08 → 2381.52] Father,
[2381.72 → 2384.00] as the bread enters into our stomachs
[2384.00 → 2386.50] and the juice enters into our stomachs,
[2386.54 → 2387.70] we pray that we would know
[2387.70 → 2389.88] in the deepest places of our hearts
[2389.88 → 2393.00] that we are free.
[2393.50 → 2397.32] we pray that we would receive your grace,
[2398.32 → 2399.58] that we would know
[2399.58 → 2401.44] just how much you have gone,
[2401.56 → 2403.08] how far you've gone for us
[2403.08 → 2404.88] and for our salvation.
[2406.64 → 2408.18] Lord, by your spirit,
[2409.30 → 2410.42] allow us to know
[2410.42 → 2412.32] that we are loved,
[2413.06 → 2413.78] we are forgiven,
[2414.34 → 2415.92] and we belong to you.
[2416.72 → 2418.12] All praise be to Jesus.
[2418.84 → 2419.10] Amen.
[2420.90 → 2422.42] I invite you to stand in your homes
[2422.42 → 2423.34] and sing with us
[2423.34 → 2424.46] a song of response,
[2424.66 → 2425.46] Is He Worthy?
[2425.46 → 2427.92] Amen.
[2430.14 → 2431.20] Amen.
[2431.74 → 2432.04] Amen.
[2432.32 → 2433.20] Amen.
[2433.20 → 2434.72] Amen.
[2434.72 → 2437.10] Amen.
[2437.10 → 2439.16] you
