[0.00 --> 11.64]  Some of you are saying he's limping again.
[11.64 --> 13.70]  And you're right.
[13.70 --> 18.14]  Another pickleball injury.
[18.14 --> 20.44]  And this time it was very, very humbling.
[20.44 --> 22.32]  Apparently I need a lot of humbling.
[22.32 --> 29.14]  I was playing against this woman and her 84-year-old mother.
[29.14 --> 33.26]  And I limped off the court.
[33.26 --> 34.32]  It's not a big deal.
[34.32 --> 38.64]  But it is a humbling thing sometimes.
[38.64 --> 39.64]  Good morning to you all.
[39.64 --> 42.82]  It's so good to be with you.
[42.82 --> 51.46]  I also want to acknowledge the offering that, remember, we are collecting money for flood
[51.46 --> 52.46]  relief.
[52.46 --> 59.92]  So we're trying to collect enough money for the three wells that we'd like to put in,
[59.92 --> 62.38]  I think it was the Central American country, if I remember correctly.
[63.38 --> 69.74]  And so we just encourage you to give to those things and that we can bless other people with
[69.74 --> 71.26]  our resources as well.
[71.26 --> 77.18]  In the past couple of weeks, we've been talking about blessings.
[78.18 --> 80.90]  It's a word that's rich in meaning.
[81.26 --> 85.68]  It's a word that is used to describe what God is doing.
[85.88 --> 90.00]  He's bringing his blessing, his flourishing to the world.
[91.98 --> 99.34]  And Pastor Dave started this Advent Christmas series with In the Beginning, right from the
[99.34 --> 100.26]  Star, Genesis.
[101.04 --> 108.72]  And we are created right then to flourish, to experience the blessing of walking with our
[108.72 --> 110.96]  Creator in the Garden of Life.
[112.22 --> 116.28]  And then we come to the fall, human rebellion against God.
[116.76 --> 122.14]  And the phrase that tripped us up was, you will be like God.
[122.20 --> 123.76]  And that somehow seemed appealing.
[124.18 --> 126.82]  And so alongside blessings, we now have curses.
[126.82 --> 128.92]  Those are the effects of sin.
[129.34 --> 137.40]  And we try to find blessing elsewhere apart from God, but it doesn't turn out well.
[138.48 --> 141.72]  And God continues to promise to restore and renew all things.
[141.78 --> 146.82]  And he calls Abraham to be a nation, to be a light to the world, a blessing to the world.
[147.08 --> 151.00]  And that nation eventually ends up in Egypt as slaves.
[151.00 --> 154.26]  And we have Exodus, and once again, God restores.
[154.52 --> 159.46]  And he continues being faithful to his promises, even when we aren't.
[162.06 --> 167.10]  You know, I was looking at this, I'm sitting there and I've been looking at these banners.
[167.62 --> 170.54]  And I almost felt like here we have the beginning.
[171.30 --> 174.02]  And here we have the end, the alpha and the omega.
[174.34 --> 177.02]  In the middle of all of that, we have Christ.
[177.02 --> 181.72]  And I've been seeing that in my own mind as a flame.
[182.40 --> 184.02]  It kind of looked like a flame to me.
[184.44 --> 187.06]  And that somehow, there's the light of the world here.
[187.74 --> 192.46]  And, you know, Israel comes to the promised land, but this is ultimately the promise.
[192.80 --> 194.68]  And what was God after all along?
[194.80 --> 198.06]  They come to the promised land and it feels like, oh, things are now fulfilled.
[198.20 --> 199.18]  In a sense they are.
[199.58 --> 202.92]  But look, what was God after all along through this whole story?
[202.92 --> 205.48]  And let me read to you out of Psalm 67.
[205.82 --> 208.30]  The psalmist writes this about what God was after.
[208.72 --> 216.66]  May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine on us so that your ways may be known on earth.
[217.10 --> 217.72]  There's the point.
[218.44 --> 222.08]  Your salvation to all, all the nations.
[223.14 --> 224.62]  May the peoples praise God.
[225.08 --> 229.28]  God, may all the people, all the people praise God, have a relationship with him.
[229.28 --> 233.26]  May the nations be glad and sing for joy.
[233.58 --> 237.00]  For you rule the people with equity and guide the nations of the earth.
[237.24 --> 240.12]  And that's what God's been after this whole time.
[242.48 --> 245.66]  And now Israel's in the promised land.
[245.86 --> 248.54]  And you think, well, that's exactly what happened then, right?
[248.64 --> 251.00]  Then it doesn't go that way.
[252.30 --> 255.04]  God continues to be faithful, but people not so much.
[255.04 --> 263.44]  You know, and I was thinking of this, that some of you might be thinking, this series, Dave and Sid, isn't very Christmassy.
[265.18 --> 266.80]  You know, where's the Christmas stuff?
[268.08 --> 279.04]  You know, and what we want you to see and what we want you to know is that this whole story, from beginning to end, is the story.
[279.32 --> 283.34]  And Christmas is a central part of that story.
[283.34 --> 287.84]  You need to know the whole thing.
[292.02 --> 296.56]  Paul writes, and he quotes Isaiah in Romans 15, where Isaiah says,
[297.08 --> 299.52]  The root of Jesse, Jesse was King David's father.
[299.94 --> 301.78]  There's this big promise thing going on here.
[301.86 --> 303.84]  The root of Jesse will spring up.
[303.96 --> 306.78]  One who will arise to rule over the nations.
[307.18 --> 309.78]  In him, the Gentiles, us, have hope.
[311.42 --> 313.14]  It's the whole thing.
[313.34 --> 319.14]  Yeah, Israel did get to the promised land.
[319.48 --> 322.06]  And then we have this period of time called the Judges.
[323.18 --> 326.64]  And these Judges are called by God to lead Israel as God leads them.
[326.72 --> 327.66]  That's how it's supposed to go.
[327.88 --> 331.54]  Stories of Samson and Deborah and Samuel and Gideon.
[332.70 --> 334.82]  This doesn't go particularly well.
[334.82 --> 341.42]  Too often those judges live their lives seeking out blessings apart from God.
[341.62 --> 342.52]  It doesn't go well.
[342.52 --> 349.90]  And Israel typically says, Oh, I think we have a solution that's required here.
[350.22 --> 353.04]  And here's their solution out of 1 Samuel 8, 5.
[354.12 --> 359.06]  They, the people, the leaders of Israel at that time, they said to him, Samuel, the very last judge,
[359.54 --> 359.94]  You know what?
[360.00 --> 360.52]  You're old.
[361.04 --> 362.88]  Your sons, they don't follow your ways.
[362.88 --> 365.24]  Now appoint a king to lead us.
[365.26 --> 366.50]  And then this sad line.
[366.68 --> 371.26]  Appoint a king to lead us such as all the other nations have.
[371.26 --> 380.42]  And I was thinking, if I was God, that would really hurt.
[382.64 --> 390.32]  The whole game plan has been to bless the world, to bless all the nations, to show the light the better way.
[390.78 --> 393.66]  And then these people say, You know what's a better way?
[393.90 --> 396.26]  The better way is what the other nations are doing.
[396.94 --> 398.60]  Let's follow that.
[401.26 --> 406.46]  I'm sure it must sting.
[408.34 --> 411.88]  And it reminds me again, you can be like God.
[412.08 --> 412.92]  You can be like God.
[412.98 --> 414.00]  You can call the shots.
[414.28 --> 415.38]  You can write the story.
[415.80 --> 417.96]  You get to define blessings on your term.
[418.06 --> 418.78]  That's what we want.
[418.98 --> 420.34]  And it never goes well.
[420.64 --> 421.36]  They get kings.
[421.72 --> 425.70]  And then the operative word, if you go through all the kings, 1 and 2 Kings and all those kings,
[426.10 --> 428.74]  the operative word is divided heart.
[428.74 --> 432.18]  And they all end up leading with this divided heart.
[432.50 --> 433.58]  Kind of for God.
[433.92 --> 435.08]  Kind of for the ways of the world.
[435.32 --> 436.98]  And we're going to try to marry the two of them.
[437.30 --> 439.80]  And somehow we think that might work well.
[441.22 --> 442.30]  And it doesn't.
[443.12 --> 445.22]  It just doesn't.
[445.22 --> 449.80]  And so all that big, big story.
[450.00 --> 454.96]  And now what I want to do now is now bring it right down to one story, to one person.
[455.52 --> 461.52]  Because your story and individual stories intersect with the grand story.
[461.52 --> 464.36]  That's what's going on.
[464.58 --> 466.00]  Our individual stories.
[466.08 --> 471.90]  When I used to teach Bible to grades various times, 7 through 9.
[472.82 --> 476.18]  You know, I would hold up the Bible and I'd say, this is the story of the world.
[476.70 --> 478.54]  You're in this book.
[480.74 --> 481.68]  And you are.
[483.46 --> 484.10]  You are.
[484.20 --> 485.48]  It's from the beginning to the end.
[485.48 --> 487.82]  You are in the story.
[488.18 --> 490.64]  So we're going to go look at it in a very individual story now.
[490.78 --> 495.88]  And then see how God takes an individual story to tie into his grand narrative.
[496.68 --> 499.96]  So we're going to read out of 2 Samuel 7, 1 through 13 about King David.
[500.26 --> 501.96]  Since we're at the time of the kings now.
[503.20 --> 504.06]  Look at it with me.
[504.06 --> 508.06]  After King David was settled in his palace.
[508.58 --> 511.42]  And the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies around him.
[511.90 --> 513.86]  He said to Nathan, the prophet.
[514.72 --> 515.54]  Here I am.
[516.16 --> 517.34]  Living in a house of cedar.
[517.58 --> 520.20]  While the ark of God remains in a tent.
[520.92 --> 521.44]  The tabernacle.
[522.36 --> 523.32]  Nathan replied to God.
[523.40 --> 524.68]  Whatever you have in mind.
[524.84 --> 526.20]  Or to David, the king.
[526.26 --> 527.10]  Whatever you have in mind.
[527.10 --> 528.16]  Go ahead and do it.
[528.24 --> 529.28]  For the Lord is with you.
[530.76 --> 532.72]  That night the word of the Lord came to Nathan.
[532.94 --> 533.26]  Saying.
[533.26 --> 534.96]  Go and tell my servant David.
[535.16 --> 536.36]  This is what the Lord says.
[536.78 --> 539.28]  Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in?
[540.00 --> 545.64]  I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought you out of Egypt to this day.
[545.84 --> 548.74]  I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling.
[549.38 --> 552.18]  Whenever I have moved with all the Israelites.
[552.64 --> 553.30]  Or wherever rather.
[553.64 --> 555.72]  Did I ever say to any of their rulers.
[555.88 --> 558.32]  Whom I had commanded to shepherd my people Israel.
[558.84 --> 562.04]  Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
[562.04 --> 564.14]  Now then.
[564.36 --> 565.20]  Tell my servant David.
[565.76 --> 567.12]  This is what the Lord Almighty says.
[568.22 --> 570.44]  I took you from the pasture.
[570.92 --> 571.92]  From tending the flock.
[572.02 --> 573.84]  And appointed you ruler over my people Israel.
[574.84 --> 577.08]  I have been with you wherever you have gone.
[577.50 --> 580.12]  I have cut off all your enemies from before you.
[580.46 --> 583.32]  And now I will make your name great.
[583.50 --> 585.20]  Like the names of the greatest men on earth.
[585.20 --> 587.42]  And I will provide a place for my people Israel.
[587.42 --> 589.80]  And will plant them so that they can have a home of their own.
[590.16 --> 592.14]  And no longer be disturbed.
[592.30 --> 594.12]  Wicked people will no longer oppress them.
[594.34 --> 596.02]  As they did in the beginning.
[596.50 --> 598.04]  And have done so ever since that time.
[598.14 --> 600.22]  I appointed leaders over my people Israel.
[600.22 --> 602.90]  I will also give you rest from all your enemies.
[603.78 --> 608.38]  The Lord declares to you that the Lord himself will establish a house for you.
[608.84 --> 609.96]  And when your days are over.
[610.16 --> 611.54]  And you rest with your ancestors.
[611.54 --> 614.64]  I will raise up your offspring to succeed you.
[614.74 --> 615.92]  Your own flesh and blood.
[616.34 --> 618.34]  And I will establish his kingdom.
[619.44 --> 622.16]  He is the one who will be able to build a house for my name.
[622.52 --> 624.84]  And I will establish the throne forever.
[624.84 --> 629.42]  Very specific time now.
[630.60 --> 632.26]  And you might read this as I did too.
[632.46 --> 633.78]  You know saying well done David.
[634.06 --> 637.58]  You know you want to build God a place for him to settle.
[638.92 --> 639.68]  You picture David.
[639.80 --> 640.46]  He is sitting there.
[641.14 --> 641.98]  Maybe the fire is going.
[642.08 --> 644.28]  He is sitting in a fancy cedar palace.
[644.68 --> 645.26]  His feet up.
[645.32 --> 646.34]  Maybe in a lounge chair.
[646.60 --> 647.42]  He is enjoying a drink.
[647.52 --> 649.34]  He is reflecting on success and blessings.
[649.84 --> 651.42]  And then he is picturing there is God.
[651.74 --> 653.24]  In that ark of the covenant there.
[653.32 --> 653.76]  In a tent.
[653.76 --> 655.56]  And somehow it feels wrong.
[657.36 --> 658.74]  I mean you know.
[659.44 --> 660.58]  It shouldn't be this way should it?
[661.40 --> 662.50]  And he said you know.
[662.54 --> 663.34]  He said I am the king.
[664.00 --> 666.04]  I can fix this problem right?
[666.30 --> 668.00]  I mean I have got resources.
[668.64 --> 670.14]  I have defeated my enemies.
[670.40 --> 671.28]  I have power.
[671.60 --> 674.16]  I mean kings can be great problem solvers.
[675.96 --> 677.58]  I am being a little hard on David here.
[677.76 --> 679.88]  I am pretty sure his motives were mixed.
[680.28 --> 681.70]  He does want to honor God.
[681.70 --> 683.66]  But at the same time.
[683.76 --> 684.94]  He acts like king.
[685.44 --> 687.66]  Acts like he is writing the story.
[688.22 --> 690.58]  He acts like he is setting the agenda.
[692.52 --> 695.20]  And we are reminded of the line.
[695.60 --> 698.86]  That the judge Samuel heard from the people of Israel.
[698.86 --> 701.92]  We want a king like other nations.
[702.86 --> 704.44]  We want a king like other nations.
[704.92 --> 706.14]  Kings are agenda setters.
[706.78 --> 707.68]  They know what they are doing.
[708.04 --> 709.22]  And kings in those days.
[709.38 --> 711.28]  Would honor their national gods.
[711.34 --> 712.68]  Because that is what they thought gods were.
[713.04 --> 713.96]  The nations gods.
[714.04 --> 715.46]  And Israel had a national god.
[715.52 --> 716.52]  That is what they are picturing here.
[716.88 --> 718.48]  The nations gods with temples.
[718.58 --> 719.86]  They build temples for their gods.
[720.08 --> 722.14]  And then with that you centralize power.
[722.46 --> 723.10]  You have the king.
[723.34 --> 725.52]  And then you have the god in the temple.
[725.52 --> 728.54]  And the two of them together equal more power.
[729.54 --> 730.38]  Centralized power.
[732.38 --> 732.96]  Now again.
[733.64 --> 735.22]  I am being a little bit hard on David.
[735.52 --> 737.70]  I think his motives are good and bad.
[738.12 --> 741.28]  I mean scripture describes him as a man after God's own heart.
[741.28 --> 745.04]  I want that on my tombstone.
[747.82 --> 750.38]  Recently King David had brought the ark of the covenant.
[750.52 --> 751.58]  The ark of God to Jerusalem.
[751.72 --> 754.38]  And he danced for joy before that ark.
[754.82 --> 756.86]  Because he meant it.
[759.96 --> 762.82]  And then he has this temple idea.
[764.02 --> 766.40]  And he says surely God wants a temple right.
[766.40 --> 768.54]  And then not so fast.
[768.68 --> 770.58]  King agenda setter says God.
[771.44 --> 773.64]  And you can hear the silence in the room.
[775.42 --> 776.56]  And God says King David.
[776.68 --> 779.00]  Let me remind you of your true story.
[779.92 --> 781.60]  The one I am the author of.
[781.90 --> 784.38]  The one I have invited you to partake in.
[786.46 --> 789.92]  I brought you from the pastures to the palace.
[791.36 --> 793.48]  I led you against your enemies.
[793.48 --> 796.02]  And let's expand a little bit on this.
[796.42 --> 798.66]  That tent that you think is beneath me.
[798.84 --> 799.68]  Should remind you.
[800.00 --> 802.68]  That I am the God who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
[802.92 --> 803.60]  Out of slavery.
[803.92 --> 806.74]  I am the God who led the people through the wilderness.
[807.18 --> 808.06]  And sustained them.
[808.30 --> 810.30]  I am the God who had invited you to life.
[810.54 --> 812.04]  Even given you my commands.
[812.24 --> 814.38]  So you'd know how to live well.
[817.30 --> 819.00]  I am the one who overcame Pharaoh.
[819.06 --> 820.70]  And all of Egypt's so called gods.
[821.48 --> 823.82]  And when did I ever demand.
[823.82 --> 826.32]  A cedar palace from you.
[827.64 --> 828.76]  I go where you go.
[828.88 --> 830.48]  I am with you because I am Yahweh.
[830.72 --> 832.18]  Your loving faithful God.
[832.40 --> 833.66]  The almighty one.
[833.66 --> 840.68]  There is a tension that occurs here.
[841.32 --> 843.14]  That I think we often find ourselves in.
[843.52 --> 844.14]  And it is this.
[844.42 --> 846.96]  We project our needs onto God.
[847.18 --> 849.28]  And it is such a human tendency to assume.
[849.48 --> 851.74]  God wants what we want.
[852.56 --> 854.42]  I am not saying he doesn't.
[854.90 --> 857.66]  But we assume we are setting the agenda here.
[857.66 --> 861.60]  And so what we do for God.
[861.68 --> 863.44]  What we would want.
[863.70 --> 864.18]  After all.
[864.50 --> 864.84]  God.
[865.08 --> 865.30]  You know.
[865.50 --> 868.10]  He needs to do what we want.
[868.20 --> 868.46]  Right?
[870.08 --> 871.34]  I mean that is why he is God.
[871.40 --> 871.72]  Isn't it?
[872.10 --> 874.76]  And it is an inversion of Amazio Dei.
[874.98 --> 875.64]  Amazio Dei.
[875.72 --> 876.36]  The image of God.
[876.74 --> 879.44]  Where we are supposed to reflect the image of God.
[879.60 --> 880.68]  But we invert this.
[881.04 --> 883.74]  And so we make God in our image.
[883.74 --> 886.24]  And we make him align with our desire.
[886.38 --> 887.18]  And our choices.
[887.70 --> 888.94]  And our politics.
[889.18 --> 889.56]  Because I mean.
[889.72 --> 891.48]  Surely God votes like we do.
[891.60 --> 891.84]  Right?
[897.50 --> 899.32]  This is a sovereign God.
[902.30 --> 903.82]  This is the Lord almighty.
[905.18 --> 906.74]  He is the king of kings.
[906.82 --> 907.80]  The author of life.
[908.18 --> 909.64]  Let's not forget that.
[909.96 --> 910.98]  And he creates.
[911.26 --> 912.12]  And he blesses.
[912.30 --> 913.18]  And he saves.
[913.18 --> 914.26]  And he restores.
[914.50 --> 915.60]  And he renews.
[917.46 --> 920.30]  And he comes to us.
[921.10 --> 922.22]  Not the other way around.
[925.96 --> 927.46]  At the start of the series.
[927.72 --> 929.78]  Pastor Dave read out of John's gospel.
[929.88 --> 931.12]  I'm going to do so again today.
[931.96 --> 932.42]  Because.
[932.84 --> 933.08]  Okay.
[933.20 --> 935.20]  Let's get to the Christmas story here.
[935.60 --> 937.66]  And it's happening all the time.
[937.98 --> 939.28]  But let's get specific here.
[939.70 --> 942.82]  But John does this whole thing of telling the whole story.
[942.82 --> 944.54]  While he tells the Christmas story as well.
[944.54 --> 946.16]  And I'm going to read it out of the message.
[946.98 --> 948.10]  So look at it with me.
[949.78 --> 950.48]  John writes.
[950.82 --> 952.32]  Everything was created through him.
[952.40 --> 952.78]  That's Jesus.
[953.02 --> 954.36]  Everything was created through him.
[954.46 --> 954.74]  Nothing.
[955.04 --> 955.92]  Not one thing.
[956.16 --> 957.36]  Came into being without him.
[958.98 --> 960.96]  What came into existence was life.
[961.36 --> 963.80]  And the life was the light to live by.
[963.94 --> 964.10]  Alright.
[964.10 --> 965.74]  There's what's supposed to be happening here.
[966.10 --> 968.70]  The life light blazed out of the darkness.
[968.82 --> 970.14]  And the darkness couldn't put it out.
[970.32 --> 971.06]  The whole story of scripture.
[971.22 --> 971.86]  Couldn't put it out.
[972.34 --> 974.58]  He came to his own people.
[974.76 --> 975.68]  But they didn't want him.
[975.68 --> 979.30]  But whoever did want him.
[979.40 --> 982.24]  Whoever believed he was the one he claimed to be.
[982.58 --> 983.64]  And would do what he said.
[983.92 --> 984.60]  He made.
[984.74 --> 985.26]  And hear this.
[985.52 --> 988.34]  He made to be their true selves.
[989.72 --> 991.02]  Their true selves.
[992.14 --> 994.74]  Their child of God selves.
[995.26 --> 997.00]  These are God begotten.
[997.06 --> 997.96]  Not blood begotten.
[998.02 --> 998.78]  Not flesh begotten.
[998.86 --> 999.80]  Not sex begotten.
[1000.46 --> 1001.34]  And then we have the line.
[1001.34 --> 1002.32]  The word.
[1003.08 --> 1003.60]  Jesus.
[1004.12 --> 1006.18]  The word became flesh and blood.
[1006.86 --> 1009.78]  And moved into the neighborhood.
[1011.40 --> 1013.26]  And you see the Christmas story.
[1013.42 --> 1016.40]  Landing right in the midst of the whole grand story.
[1020.10 --> 1021.46]  That's the story.
[1023.50 --> 1024.46]  That's your story.
[1024.56 --> 1025.34]  That's my story.
[1025.52 --> 1026.40]  The true story of the world.
[1026.46 --> 1027.16]  That's our story.
[1027.58 --> 1028.58]  The story of Christmas.
[1028.58 --> 1030.76]  And if we don't remember that.
[1030.76 --> 1033.12]  We too will give in to our tendencies.
[1033.12 --> 1034.66]  To setting the agenda.
[1034.94 --> 1035.74]  Even for God.
[1035.92 --> 1038.36]  And we will act like we know what's going on.
[1038.50 --> 1039.82]  When we don't.
[1042.46 --> 1044.34]  We will define blessings.
[1044.88 --> 1046.24]  In our own way.
[1046.58 --> 1047.94]  And those blessings are too often.
[1048.08 --> 1049.22]  Actually curses.
[1049.54 --> 1050.80]  Disguised as blessings.
[1051.10 --> 1052.54]  And we see that all the time.
[1052.82 --> 1054.44]  I'll fix it with my money.
[1054.72 --> 1056.16]  I'll fix it with my efforts.
[1056.36 --> 1057.50]  I'll fix it with alcohol.
[1057.50 --> 1058.92]  I'll fix it with sex.
[1058.92 --> 1061.20]  I'll fix it with whatever you want to name.
[1061.50 --> 1063.80]  And all these things that often are blessings.
[1063.94 --> 1064.94]  Suddenly become curses.
[1065.12 --> 1068.10]  Because we don't acknowledge the author of life in them.
[1075.24 --> 1078.96]  God doesn't need us to take charge of his redemptive story.
[1079.22 --> 1082.98]  He needs us to participate in the ways he's created us to participate.
[1082.98 --> 1088.50]  He needs us to follow him and do our part according to his plan.
[1088.72 --> 1091.66]  And we need to learn to slow down and hear this.
[1091.98 --> 1093.84]  Let God build us.
[1094.52 --> 1096.38]  Because we don't build him.
[1098.38 --> 1100.48]  Let him dwell in us.
[1100.48 --> 1102.48]  God.
[1102.48 --> 1104.54]  This is the God who came and became a baby.
[1105.08 --> 1106.20]  Who would have made that plan?
[1107.70 --> 1109.02]  God who became a baby.
[1109.28 --> 1113.58]  A God who was nursed by a teenage girl in a stable.
[1114.62 --> 1114.84]  Yeah.
[1114.94 --> 1116.18]  We would have all planned that one.
[1116.26 --> 1116.46]  Right?
[1118.86 --> 1119.88]  Not a chance.
[1122.58 --> 1123.52]  And he says.
[1123.72 --> 1126.36]  When did I ever demand a temple from you?
[1126.36 --> 1128.14]  I go where I go.
[1128.40 --> 1129.32]  And I am Emmanuel.
[1129.70 --> 1131.20]  God with you.
[1131.40 --> 1133.16]  So follow me.
[1136.32 --> 1137.80]  Not your foolish thoughts.
[1139.38 --> 1143.14]  And God reminds David and he reminds us that the divine presence is with them.
[1143.26 --> 1144.76]  Whether you're in tents.
[1144.92 --> 1145.94]  Or in the pastures.
[1146.06 --> 1146.86]  Or among the sheep.
[1147.04 --> 1147.90]  Or in the battles.
[1148.26 --> 1150.20]  And he cannot be contained.
[1151.06 --> 1155.04]  And it's interesting to me that David uses the Hebrew word here when he talks about the temple.
[1155.04 --> 1157.66]  He uses the Hebrew word by eight.
[1158.40 --> 1159.26]  Which means house.
[1159.86 --> 1162.08]  But it has other meanings as well.
[1162.44 --> 1164.26]  And when God uses that same word.
[1164.44 --> 1166.76]  He uses it to refer to a dynasty.
[1168.56 --> 1170.62]  We see that in 2 Samuel 16.
[1170.82 --> 1170.88]  Right?
[1171.26 --> 1172.18]  Your house.
[1172.60 --> 1173.48]  Your dynasty.
[1173.90 --> 1178.00]  Your kingdom shall be made sure forever and ever before me.
[1178.82 --> 1180.24]  And then we can read again.
[1180.52 --> 1181.34]  The Christmas story.
[1181.42 --> 1181.84]  Luke 1.
[1181.88 --> 1182.42]  Look at it with me.
[1182.96 --> 1184.12]  We're jumping now into the Christmas story.
[1184.12 --> 1186.20]  He says, in the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy.
[1186.32 --> 1187.54]  A cousin of Mary's.
[1187.74 --> 1189.92]  God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth.
[1190.00 --> 1190.94]  To a town of Galilee.
[1191.16 --> 1192.78]  To a virgin pledged to be married.
[1193.10 --> 1194.20]  To a man named Joseph.
[1194.36 --> 1194.88]  Here we go.
[1195.18 --> 1196.74]  A descendant of David.
[1197.00 --> 1197.26]  Whoa.
[1197.44 --> 1197.76]  Wait a minute.
[1197.88 --> 1199.12]  This is all part of that whole story?
[1199.20 --> 1199.40]  Yeah.
[1199.58 --> 1200.58]  A descendant of David.
[1200.94 --> 1202.20]  And the virgin's name was Mary.
[1202.94 --> 1204.44]  And the angel went to her and he said.
[1204.84 --> 1206.58]  Greetings you who are highly favored.
[1206.96 --> 1207.76]  And here we are again.
[1207.98 --> 1209.64]  The Lord is with you.
[1209.84 --> 1211.62]  He's setting the agenda again.
[1211.62 --> 1216.22]  He's making history go forward on his terms.
[1217.02 --> 1217.78]  Because he's God.
[1223.86 --> 1225.70]  And David's puny agenda.
[1226.24 --> 1227.84]  Of simply building a structure.
[1228.26 --> 1230.20]  Is dwarfed by God's almighty and sure promises.
[1230.74 --> 1232.20]  To overcome sin and death.
[1232.52 --> 1234.10]  And to restore and renew all things.
[1235.48 --> 1236.28]  And David's story.
[1236.36 --> 1237.28]  Like Israel's story.
[1237.40 --> 1237.98]  And ours too.
[1238.22 --> 1240.20]  Is lifted from smallness into greatness.
[1240.20 --> 1243.36]  From smallness into greatness.
[1243.98 --> 1245.40]  From a building project.
[1245.60 --> 1246.44]  To an eternal kingdom.
[1247.60 --> 1248.40]  And by and large.
[1248.60 --> 1250.02]  When we look at the history of the kings.
[1250.06 --> 1250.58]  And the monarch.
[1251.00 --> 1253.18]  It is a history of disobedient agenda setting.
[1253.76 --> 1254.86]  Looking for blessings.
[1254.86 --> 1256.02]  In all the wrong places.
[1256.38 --> 1258.30]  And there are lots of consequences to that.
[1258.50 --> 1259.16]  Even exile.
[1259.48 --> 1261.66]  But the promises of the Lord still prevail.
[1262.04 --> 1263.32]  And the forever kingdom is assured.
[1263.44 --> 1265.06]  Because David's line comes to Christ.
[1265.24 --> 1266.34]  The one true king.
[1266.64 --> 1267.44]  The hope of Israel.
[1267.56 --> 1268.22]  And the hope of the world.
[1268.22 --> 1270.28]  And he brings shalom.
[1270.92 --> 1272.10]  He brings the peace.
[1272.28 --> 1274.34]  That has proven to be so elusive to us.
[1275.76 --> 1276.76]  And in Jesus.
[1277.52 --> 1279.16]  God's adopted sons and daughters.
[1279.16 --> 1280.92]  Find the rest for which they've longed for.
[1281.00 --> 1282.58]  Ever since they exited Eden.
[1285.26 --> 1286.08]  And in Jesus.
[1286.24 --> 1288.00]  We find that rest from our sins.
[1288.72 --> 1290.50]  And rest from the senseless task.
[1290.62 --> 1291.78]  Of trying to save ourselves.
[1292.00 --> 1293.26]  And satisfy ourselves.
[1293.26 --> 1294.42]  According to our desires.
[1294.42 --> 1298.04]  People of God.
[1298.80 --> 1300.36]  Rest from your desire.
[1300.68 --> 1302.76]  To manage God.
[1304.44 --> 1305.54]  Rest from that.
[1306.50 --> 1307.78]  It's a fool's errand.
[1309.36 --> 1311.22]  And allow him to save you.
[1311.98 --> 1313.12]  And to shape you.
[1313.52 --> 1314.66]  And restore you.
[1315.28 --> 1316.10]  And renew you.
[1317.68 --> 1318.92]  And to bless you.
[1318.92 --> 1321.88]  And allow him to write your story.
[1322.30 --> 1324.26]  And to follow him as the author of your life.
[1324.80 --> 1325.78]  Because he is.
[1327.80 --> 1331.18]  He is the God who brings blessings to you.
[1333.34 --> 1334.88]  And then I love Paul's words.
[1335.14 --> 1336.34]  Ephesians 3.20.
[1337.04 --> 1337.54]  Where he writes.
[1337.80 --> 1339.98]  To him who is able to do immeasurably more.
[1340.16 --> 1341.94]  Than all we ask or imagine.
[1342.08 --> 1342.52]  Think of that.
[1342.58 --> 1344.04]  That all we ask or imagine.
[1344.04 --> 1346.90]  According to his power that is at work within us.
[1346.90 --> 1349.02]  To him be the glory in the church.
[1349.42 --> 1350.38]  And in Christ Jesus.
[1350.60 --> 1351.64]  Throughout all generations.
[1351.86 --> 1353.02]  Forever and ever.
[1353.48 --> 1353.88]  Amen.
[1356.62 --> 1358.00]  Don't limit God.
[1358.20 --> 1359.08]  With your agendas.
[1360.36 --> 1361.22]  And don't let the.
[1361.34 --> 1363.38]  Don't let the world set your agenda.
[1363.56 --> 1364.74]  And when we say world here.
[1364.80 --> 1365.86]  We just mean those forces.
[1365.86 --> 1368.16]  That are outside of God's plan here.
[1368.44 --> 1370.22]  Don't let the world set your agenda either.
[1370.48 --> 1371.80]  Church has got to be aware of that too.
[1372.00 --> 1373.54]  Sometimes we fit so easily.
[1373.54 --> 1374.56]  Into the world around us.
[1374.56 --> 1377.40]  And we set up for small unsatisfying stories.
[1377.56 --> 1379.86]  When God offers us life in all its fullness.
[1380.06 --> 1381.60]  In his grand story.
[1384.68 --> 1386.20]  And now with that in mind.
[1387.64 --> 1389.28]  And I want you to keep this in mind.
[1389.34 --> 1391.72]  As you go through this season of Christmas.
[1391.94 --> 1392.68]  With that in mind.
[1393.46 --> 1394.58]  Let me wish you.
[1395.40 --> 1397.64]  A blessed Christmas.
[1399.44 --> 1400.04]  Let's pray.
[1400.04 --> 1403.70]  Father God.
[1403.80 --> 1404.66]  We come before you.
[1405.24 --> 1406.40]  And we thank you Lord.
[1406.48 --> 1407.78]  That you are the author of life.
[1408.90 --> 1409.70]  We thank you.
[1409.76 --> 1410.78]  That you are the one.
[1410.88 --> 1411.84]  Who writes our stories.
[1412.18 --> 1412.40]  And Lord.
[1412.46 --> 1413.96]  Help us to fight the tendencies.
[1414.18 --> 1415.70]  We have to want to set the agenda.
[1415.94 --> 1417.32]  To want to write our own stories.
[1417.32 --> 1418.10]  On our terms.
[1418.26 --> 1420.00]  Because it doesn't go well.
[1421.38 --> 1422.36]  You love us Lord.
[1422.48 --> 1423.70]  And if we live in your love.
[1423.74 --> 1424.86]  And we follow your plans.
[1425.14 --> 1425.30]  Lord.
[1425.34 --> 1426.70]  That doesn't mean that we won't have hardship.
[1426.70 --> 1428.70]  But we will know your purposes.
[1428.86 --> 1430.16]  And we will know your strength.
[1430.40 --> 1431.82]  And we will know your will.
[1431.92 --> 1433.16]  More and more and more.
[1433.58 --> 1434.86]  As we become like your son.
[1436.04 --> 1438.80]  Forgive us for imposing our agendas on you.
[1438.84 --> 1439.94]  And trying to manage you Lord.
[1440.58 --> 1441.10]  Brother Lord.
[1441.18 --> 1442.46]  May we just learn to surrender.
[1443.00 --> 1444.38]  And give our lives to you.
[1445.22 --> 1447.60]  And trust that the author of the grand story.
[1447.72 --> 1449.48]  From the beginning to the end is you.
[1450.62 --> 1451.74]  And you know what you are doing.
[1452.50 --> 1453.68]  And we need to trust you.
[1453.74 --> 1454.36]  In Jesus name.
[1454.86 --> 1455.10]  Amen.
[1455.10 --> 1455.20]  Amen.
[1456.70 --> 1457.70]  Amen.
