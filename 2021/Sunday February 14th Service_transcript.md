[0.00 --> 5.64]  Good morning.
[15.54 --> 16.84]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[17.44 --> 20.38]  It's good to gather around the Word again this morning.
[21.14 --> 25.96]  And it's a gift to be able to hear God speak to us together as we open the Scriptures.
[25.96 --> 29.94]  We are jumping back into our series on Apprenticing with Jesus.
[30.12 --> 34.20]  We've been working our way through different dimensions of what it means to be apprentices,
[34.52 --> 39.00]  what Jesus is inviting us together into when he says, follow me to the church today.
[39.74 --> 43.86]  And we're recovering this notion of Jesus as our teacher, learning to be with him,
[43.98 --> 49.14]  learning to be like him in his character and learning to do what he did to continue his mission.
[49.14 --> 56.98]  Last week, we looked at how Christ liberates us from a false, idolatrous story that our culture lives in.
[57.50 --> 63.52]  And this morning, we're going to open up what he pulls us into, this new community of faith that lives out of a new story.
[64.32 --> 70.78]  And so we're looking at how community is this workroom for apprenticeship and how apprenticeship is a communal endeavor.
[71.40 --> 74.32]  And for that, I invite you to turn with me to 1 Corinthians 12.
[74.60 --> 77.30]  This is a well-known passage on being the body of Christ.
[77.30 --> 81.82]  I'm going to read the first part of it, reference much of it, and then verse 27.
[82.72 --> 85.10]  This is 1 Corinthians 12, 12 to 14.
[87.30 --> 94.84]  Just as a body, though one has many parts, but all the many parts form one body, so it is with Christ.
[95.62 --> 103.24]  For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free.
[103.24 --> 106.78]  And we were all given the one Spirit to drink.
[107.40 --> 110.70]  Even so, the body is not made up of one part, but many.
[111.20 --> 112.62]  And now here, verse 27.
[113.10 --> 119.28]  Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
[119.28 --> 128.94]  In 2016, the Barna Research Group did this expansive study on discipleship in the church.
[129.84 --> 134.84]  They wanted to know what's the lay of the land for churches today, how churches are doing in discipleship,
[134.90 --> 138.40]  what are Christians saying about their own journey of discipleship.
[138.46 --> 143.60]  And so they surveyed many churches, thousands of believers, and compiled those results into this study.
[143.60 --> 148.14]  And I was looking at some of those results and intrigued by many of the findings,
[148.32 --> 150.52]  but one particular question caught my attention.
[151.40 --> 153.64]  The question that thousands of people answered was this,
[154.00 --> 156.96]  what is your preferred method of discipleship?
[157.96 --> 163.20]  And the four possible answers were A, on my own, B, with a small group,
[163.56 --> 167.30]  C, one-on-one mentoring, or D, a mix of these.
[168.04 --> 172.70]  And before I show you the pie graph results, I want you to answer in your own heart,
[172.70 --> 176.48]  what would you answer honestly to the question, what's your preferred method of discipleship?
[176.84 --> 183.26]  A, on your own, B, with a small group, C, one-on-one mentorship, or D, a mix of these.
[184.24 --> 185.12]  You got it in your head?
[186.12 --> 189.18]  All right, well, here is how the results came in.
[190.52 --> 195.52]  16% of people said, my preferred method of discipleship is one-on-one mentoring.
[195.98 --> 200.20]  21% of people said, a mix of these things are the way I grow.
[200.20 --> 205.56]  25% of people said, in a small group context, and the largest category by a lot,
[205.68 --> 209.94]  was 38% of people said, just by myself, thank you very much.
[210.22 --> 212.32]  I like to grow with Jesus alone.
[213.46 --> 216.14]  In that group is all the introverts of Hope Community Church.
[217.12 --> 219.00]  Now, I don't know how those stats hit you,
[219.06 --> 222.76]  but I want to read what the researchers themselves wrote along with this pie graph.
[222.76 --> 228.86]  They wrote, among Christians who say that spiritual growth is important,
[229.26 --> 234.66]  more than one-third say they prefer to pursue spiritual growth on their own, 37%.
[234.66 --> 236.44]  Similarly, and this is a different graph,
[236.58 --> 240.26]  two in five of all Christian adults consider their spiritual life to be, quote,
[240.36 --> 242.86]  entirely private, 41%.
[242.86 --> 247.06]  In other words, summary, one of the problems revealed by this research
[247.06 --> 251.62]  is that millions of Christians believe that discipleship is a solo affair
[251.62 --> 254.80]  with only personal and private implications.
[256.68 --> 260.26]  That, for me, is a very sobering thing to read.
[261.36 --> 264.32]  Millions of believers in our cities and around North America
[264.32 --> 267.20]  think of their faith as a private thing.
[267.50 --> 270.30]  They think of apprenticeship as a private affair.
[270.30 --> 274.04]  All that matters is me and Jesus in our own relationship.
[275.54 --> 277.10]  And this makes me think of last week
[277.10 --> 279.06]  when we were talking about how Christ liberates us
[279.06 --> 282.82]  from idolatrous cultural story with cultural idols that shape the church.
[283.24 --> 284.94]  One of those idols in the West,
[285.02 --> 288.14]  if I didn't mention it well enough last week, is individualism.
[288.34 --> 291.98]  That is that the self, the person, you as a person become the center.
[292.52 --> 295.78]  What you feel, what you want, what you desire is the most important thing.
[295.78 --> 301.36]  And this idol, let me say unequivocally, is alive and at work in the church.
[302.16 --> 304.60]  And the results of this survey are an indication of that.
[305.38 --> 307.68]  This week I found myself just coming back to different ways
[307.68 --> 310.92]  that I'm seeing this individualism, this idol of self,
[311.04 --> 312.44]  shaping how we do church.
[313.30 --> 316.12]  For example, when Brittany and I were talking this week,
[316.18 --> 316.64]  she asked me,
[316.86 --> 318.44]  Dave, what are some songs that would be fitting
[318.44 --> 320.16]  for this theme of being in the body of Christ?
[320.24 --> 323.02]  And I was like, I can't think of any off the top of my head,
[323.02 --> 324.36]  which I'm not sure what that says about me,
[324.42 --> 325.50]  but she went on to CCLI,
[325.66 --> 330.12]  which is like the worship source on the web for all things worship music.
[330.20 --> 331.76]  They have thousands and thousands of songs.
[332.00 --> 333.64]  And we looked at themes for worship.
[334.30 --> 337.58]  The theme of forgiveness has like thousands of songs.
[337.66 --> 339.46]  The theme of acceptance has thousands of songs.
[339.56 --> 342.20]  The theme of declaration, which I'm not even sure what it means,
[342.40 --> 343.84]  has 4,000 songs.
[344.04 --> 345.80]  The theme of community, you ready for this?
[346.46 --> 349.24]  Has nine songs on CCLI.
[350.70 --> 351.70]  Nine songs.
[353.02 --> 354.24]  Another indicator.
[355.40 --> 358.56]  Or let me get to something a little more in our moment right now,
[358.62 --> 359.38]  this live stream.
[359.90 --> 362.80]  So grateful for the work that's being done by John right now
[362.80 --> 364.90]  and all the things that we've done to make this live stream possible.
[365.26 --> 367.06]  But pastors, this pastor included,
[367.44 --> 369.62]  have some concerns about how this live stream
[369.62 --> 371.36]  is forming our worship habits.
[371.96 --> 374.66]  For example, there's probably some people in our church right now
[374.66 --> 375.34]  who are sleeping.
[376.76 --> 379.40]  You know who they are in your families.
[379.40 --> 382.86]  And now you can get up on Sunday at your leisure whenever you want.
[382.98 --> 384.10]  You can eat breakfast whenever you want.
[384.16 --> 385.24]  You don't have to drive to the church.
[385.34 --> 386.30]  You don't have to see other Christians.
[386.40 --> 387.20]  You don't have to worship with them.
[387.26 --> 389.36]  You don't have to do the mutual greeting that introverts don't like
[389.36 --> 390.88]  or socialize with coffee in the foyer.
[391.28 --> 392.30]  None of that has to happen.
[392.64 --> 394.02]  You can get up whenever you want.
[394.32 --> 395.80]  Don't even have to get out of your pajamas.
[396.18 --> 397.88]  You can pull out your phone whenever you want.
[397.96 --> 399.00]  It doesn't have to be at 10 a.m.
[399.00 --> 399.56]  It can be whenever.
[399.88 --> 401.06]  And even beyond that,
[401.56 --> 402.40]  you don't like the song?
[402.86 --> 403.74]  You can put it on mute.
[404.62 --> 405.44]  You don't like the announcements?
[405.44 --> 408.18]  You can go grab a coffee from the kitchen like five feet away.
[408.70 --> 409.44]  You don't like the sermon?
[409.62 --> 412.12]  If you'd like, you can even speed up the sermon,
[412.28 --> 414.44]  which I don't encourage you to do for Sid or for me,
[414.58 --> 416.54]  but you can speed it up or just turn it off
[416.54 --> 417.70]  if you don't like what we have to say.
[418.42 --> 420.30]  That's the state of live stream right now.
[420.54 --> 421.90]  And I worry that when we get back,
[421.96 --> 424.24]  we've got some bad habits to unlearn
[424.24 --> 426.70]  so that we can learn how to be a community together.
[427.58 --> 430.74]  But in this world of individualism, our culture,
[430.74 --> 435.88]  comes this notion, this misnomer of solo discipleship,
[436.58 --> 438.98]  of apprenticeship on one's own.
[439.94 --> 441.64]  And I don't know how to say it other than to say,
[441.76 --> 442.94]  number one, it's unbiblical.
[443.82 --> 445.90]  And more than that, it's just downright dangerous.
[446.70 --> 449.32]  And I'd wager to say that no matter how you slice it,
[449.90 --> 452.46]  solo apprenticeship, trying to follow Jesus on your own,
[452.52 --> 453.68]  is doomed for failure.
[454.24 --> 455.74]  It's doomed for a life of pain.
[455.74 --> 458.60]  It's doomed for a life of not really growing in Christ
[458.60 --> 460.90]  because it's not how he invites us to grow.
[461.90 --> 463.66]  In the Bible, Old and New Testament,
[464.02 --> 466.62]  whenever people come into God's family, it's a family.
[467.14 --> 469.42]  When Jesus, even when he calls his original disciples
[469.42 --> 471.04]  in the Gospels, he says,
[471.12 --> 472.68]  hey, James and John, come follow me.
[472.76 --> 474.70]  Matthew, meet Levi, the tax collector.
[474.96 --> 475.58]  Come follow me.
[475.90 --> 477.56]  Join the community of apprentices.
[478.76 --> 479.86]  They are taught together.
[480.12 --> 481.30]  They break bread together.
[481.50 --> 482.50]  They struggle together.
[482.70 --> 484.22]  They learn about the kingdom together.
[484.22 --> 486.58]  And Jesus sends them out together.
[486.58 --> 488.02]  Together, even in the book of Acts,
[488.14 --> 489.80]  this book that we often imagine
[489.80 --> 491.00]  as sort of individual disciples
[491.00 --> 493.08]  going out to different cities and planting churches,
[493.90 --> 495.70]  it's actually groups of disciples
[495.70 --> 497.68]  going out to plant communities of people
[497.68 --> 499.00]  that in their shared life
[499.00 --> 500.44]  bear witness to the kingdom of God.
[501.12 --> 502.62]  There's no place for just individuals
[502.62 --> 503.72]  doing solo ministry.
[503.94 --> 505.96]  Yes, evangelism and all the stuff we do
[505.96 --> 507.26]  in our own lives is important.
[507.70 --> 510.78]  But the Gospel always invites us into community.
[512.72 --> 514.68]  As Augustine put it, and I'm rephrasing it
[514.68 --> 515.80]  because it's a bit of old English,
[516.12 --> 517.80]  you don't get God as your father
[517.80 --> 519.78]  without the church as your mother.
[519.92 --> 522.56]  You don't get adopted into the family of the father
[522.56 --> 524.76]  without lots of brothers and sisters of faith.
[526.36 --> 529.04]  Christ invites us into community.
[530.16 --> 531.78]  Apprenticing is a communal endeavor.
[531.94 --> 533.88]  And there's some of us who are watching this live stream,
[533.96 --> 535.08]  if you haven't turned it off already,
[535.54 --> 537.68]  some of us will have to struggle with what that means.
[538.42 --> 540.56]  And you've had a privatized faith for many years.
[540.56 --> 542.80]  And this passage and this sermon, I hope,
[542.88 --> 544.34]  breaks open a different way of thinking
[544.34 --> 546.16]  about the Gospel and what it means to be an apprentice.
[546.76 --> 549.04]  Some of us might know this in our heads,
[549.70 --> 551.06]  but we do not practice it.
[551.30 --> 552.70]  You know, it's like that conversation you have
[552.70 --> 554.22]  sometimes with people in the church
[554.22 --> 556.14]  who you haven't seen in years upon years upon years.
[556.22 --> 558.44]  And like, oh man, so glad to be part of the church.
[559.12 --> 560.48]  And you're like, you're part of the church?
[561.10 --> 562.94]  Like, yeah, we were there at Easter in 2014.
[563.52 --> 565.64]  It's like, well, I think there's a different vision
[565.64 --> 566.90]  for what it means to be a part of the church.
[567.22 --> 568.34]  And you might know in your head
[568.34 --> 569.40]  that this community matters,
[569.48 --> 571.48]  that you are grafted into the body of Christ,
[571.70 --> 574.16]  yet you do not practice that which you say you believe.
[574.90 --> 577.40]  And this passage in 1 Corinthians 12
[577.40 --> 579.12]  invites us to ask the question,
[579.46 --> 581.50]  what are we as the body of Christ?
[581.60 --> 582.64]  I want to read it again.
[583.38 --> 586.06]  Just as one body, though one, has many parts,
[586.44 --> 587.96]  but all the parts form one body,
[587.96 --> 589.78]  so it is with Christ.
[590.36 --> 592.50]  For we are all baptized by one spirit
[592.50 --> 594.20]  to form one body,
[594.44 --> 596.64]  whether Jew or Gentile, slave or free,
[596.64 --> 599.40]  and we were all given the one spirit to drink.
[600.78 --> 601.92]  Now this passage is written
[601.92 --> 603.68]  to one of the more dysfunctional churches
[603.68 --> 604.52]  in the New Testament.
[604.96 --> 606.48]  In fact, when we preached on 1 Corinthians
[606.48 --> 607.34]  a few years ago,
[607.44 --> 609.72]  we called the series This Beautiful Mess.
[610.10 --> 612.22]  And the church of Corinth is a beautiful mess.
[612.48 --> 614.52]  So gifted, so full of the spirit,
[614.62 --> 615.74]  yet so divided.
[616.26 --> 617.36]  There are the wealthy and the poor,
[617.48 --> 618.40]  the Jews and the Greeks,
[618.78 --> 620.76]  those who had means and those who didn't.
[620.96 --> 623.50]  There's all sorts of division among the body.
[623.50 --> 626.40]  A sense of, I don't want to be in community with them,
[626.48 --> 628.16]  and I can't really work well with them,
[628.22 --> 630.16]  and this person's gift is annoying me,
[630.20 --> 631.18]  and this person isn't gifted.
[631.28 --> 632.02]  They think they are,
[632.08 --> 633.12]  and all sorts of factions.
[633.56 --> 635.26]  And Paul comes to the church in this passage,
[635.34 --> 635.66]  and he says,
[636.20 --> 638.56]  you are the body of Christ.
[639.22 --> 640.98]  Many gifts, many parts,
[641.62 --> 642.88]  one body.
[643.54 --> 644.70]  And he goes on to explain to them
[644.70 --> 647.22]  how they have to learn to love that body
[647.22 --> 648.42]  that they were grafted into.
[649.60 --> 650.96]  But before I say more about this passage,
[650.96 --> 651.82]  I want to zoom out,
[652.08 --> 653.82]  as I would like to do more and more these days,
[653.88 --> 654.16]  and say,
[654.48 --> 656.94]  you need to know that when God works in the world,
[657.20 --> 659.06]  his preferred method of mission,
[659.18 --> 660.82]  whether we acknowledge it or not,
[660.88 --> 661.78]  is through the church.
[663.08 --> 663.78]  Old Testament,
[663.96 --> 666.04]  when God lays out the roadmap of redemption,
[666.56 --> 666.82]  he says,
[666.90 --> 667.96]  hey, Abraham, come to me.
[668.36 --> 669.34]  This is my plan.
[669.40 --> 670.12]  I'm going to bless you,
[670.20 --> 670.88]  make your name great,
[670.96 --> 672.50]  I'm going to make you a great nation
[672.50 --> 674.44]  through whom the nations of the world
[674.44 --> 675.04]  will be blessed.
[675.54 --> 677.76]  Now here's Jesus pulling this new 12,
[677.88 --> 679.00]  this new Israel to himself.
[679.22 --> 679.96]  He's equipping them,
[679.96 --> 680.68]  he's blessing them,
[680.74 --> 681.36]  he's empowering them,
[681.38 --> 682.08]  and he's sending them
[682.08 --> 684.04]  to be his hands and feet.
[684.46 --> 685.22]  The church is,
[685.30 --> 686.38]  as we rightly describe,
[686.54 --> 687.84]  the body of Jesus,
[688.04 --> 688.82]  the body of Christ.
[689.60 --> 690.34]  Think about that.
[691.06 --> 694.86]  Christ operates through his body in the world.
[694.96 --> 696.00]  Can he operate outside of it?
[696.14 --> 697.28]  Obviously, he's God.
[698.10 --> 701.08]  But his preferred method of working in the world
[701.08 --> 701.88]  is through the church.
[702.58 --> 704.10]  And I don't think we really believe that
[704.10 --> 705.00]  in so many ways.
[705.00 --> 708.98]  There's a striking passage in Acts chapter 8,
[709.08 --> 711.10]  one commentator pulls us into this conversation
[711.10 --> 711.74]  about the body.
[712.76 --> 713.82]  It's this passage where Paul,
[713.92 --> 715.10]  before he came to Christ,
[715.18 --> 715.60]  was Saul.
[716.40 --> 717.80]  And he's threatening the church,
[717.86 --> 718.78]  he's persecuting the church,
[718.84 --> 719.74]  he's attacking Christians,
[719.84 --> 720.66]  they're afraid of him,
[720.76 --> 722.76]  and he's going to Damascus to do his thing.
[722.84 --> 724.26]  And then who shows up to speak to him?
[724.98 --> 725.58]  The Lord.
[726.36 --> 727.56]  And the Lord says to Paul,
[727.68 --> 728.82]  hey, Paul, or Saul,
[728.94 --> 729.14]  Saul,
[729.22 --> 730.42]  why are you persecuting Christians?
[731.06 --> 732.02]  It's not what it says, by the way.
[732.90 --> 733.22]  He says,
[733.34 --> 733.86]  Saul, Saul,
[733.96 --> 735.90]  why are you persecuting me?
[736.68 --> 737.34]  That is to say,
[737.42 --> 739.74]  Christ so deeply identifies with the church
[739.74 --> 741.78]  that to kick and abuse and to imprison
[741.78 --> 743.04]  and to attack the church
[743.04 --> 744.72]  is to kick and imprison Jesus.
[745.98 --> 747.98]  Do you see yourself as part of the body
[747.98 --> 750.36]  that Christ so deeply identifies with
[750.36 --> 751.78]  such that when it's attacked,
[752.00 --> 752.60]  he's attacked.
[752.70 --> 753.20]  When it's neglected,
[753.46 --> 754.04]  he's neglected.
[754.24 --> 754.84]  When it's abused,
[755.04 --> 755.86]  he's abused.
[756.72 --> 758.36]  That's how Jesus speaks of his body.
[758.46 --> 760.04]  That's us, the church.
[760.42 --> 764.56]  And notice
[764.56 --> 767.90]  how we see the word baptism showing up
[767.90 --> 769.62]  and connecting to the body.
[770.84 --> 772.08]  You know, I think it's fair to say,
[772.18 --> 772.88]  and no pun intended,
[772.98 --> 774.82]  that we've watered down the meaning of baptism.
[775.96 --> 777.44]  And so often when an adult
[777.44 --> 778.60]  or someone comes to faith
[778.60 --> 779.52]  and they're baptized,
[779.72 --> 780.64]  we see it as them making
[780.64 --> 782.00]  a public commitment to Jesus,
[782.08 --> 783.52]  which of course, that's true.
[783.94 --> 785.34]  Or when we baptize children,
[785.48 --> 786.80]  as is the case in our church as well,
[787.06 --> 788.20]  we see it as the parents
[788.20 --> 789.04]  making a commitment
[789.04 --> 790.02]  to raise that child
[790.02 --> 790.58]  to know Jesus,
[790.70 --> 791.90]  which of course is also true
[791.90 --> 793.44]  and wonderful and right.
[794.02 --> 794.88]  But baptism is about
[794.88 --> 797.20]  way, way more.
[797.66 --> 798.28]  And if you've attended
[798.28 --> 799.24]  any of the services
[799.24 --> 800.08]  where we do baptisms,
[800.46 --> 801.40]  Sid and I will always say
[801.40 --> 801.98]  the same thing.
[802.36 --> 803.74]  Baptism is the sacrament
[803.74 --> 805.08]  where this child,
[805.24 --> 805.64]  this person,
[805.76 --> 807.18]  is grafted into
[807.18 --> 808.46]  the family of faith.
[809.32 --> 810.66]  They are being brought
[810.66 --> 811.86]  into the church,
[811.98 --> 812.92]  the body of Christ.
[812.92 --> 813.68]  And now,
[814.36 --> 815.00]  baptism means
[815.00 --> 816.22]  the primary identity
[816.22 --> 817.66]  of anyone who receives it
[817.66 --> 818.96]  is that they belong
[818.96 --> 819.76]  to the Father,
[820.62 --> 821.46]  they are grafted
[821.46 --> 822.98]  into this family of faith,
[823.38 --> 824.62]  and that's who they are.
[825.34 --> 826.56]  They are part of the community
[826.56 --> 827.32]  that has died
[827.32 --> 828.26]  and risen with Christ,
[828.34 --> 828.86]  the community that's been
[828.86 --> 829.76]  filled with the Spirit,
[829.98 --> 830.82]  that's been cleansed,
[830.92 --> 831.28]  empowered,
[831.40 --> 832.06]  and sent
[832.06 --> 834.04]  to share with the world
[834.04 --> 835.36]  the true story
[835.36 --> 837.08]  that makes sense of reality.
[838.20 --> 839.12]  Baptism is about
[839.12 --> 840.02]  being grafted
[840.02 --> 841.10]  into that body.
[841.10 --> 842.12]  And what's important
[842.12 --> 842.74]  is that's the most
[842.74 --> 844.18]  primary identity.
[844.80 --> 845.50]  No longer matters
[845.50 --> 846.66]  which family you're born into,
[846.74 --> 847.02]  doesn't matter
[847.02 --> 848.06]  which vocation you have,
[848.28 --> 849.32]  your status in society,
[849.36 --> 850.00]  what matters is
[850.00 --> 851.52]  you are part
[851.52 --> 853.62]  of Christ's body.
[854.64 --> 855.76]  That's the most
[855.76 --> 856.96]  important thing
[856.96 --> 858.40]  about you.
[859.84 --> 860.98]  Do we think that way
[860.98 --> 862.12]  in the church today?
[863.78 --> 865.00]  When you get Jesus,
[865.70 --> 866.88]  you get his body.
[867.20 --> 868.04]  When you're baptized,
[868.42 --> 868.82]  you're baptized
[868.82 --> 870.04]  into a family.
[870.04 --> 871.54]  There's this phrase,
[871.66 --> 872.28]  I'm sure many of us
[872.28 --> 873.22]  have heard it at one point
[873.22 --> 873.82]  in our lives,
[874.24 --> 874.78]  the phrase is,
[874.96 --> 875.96]  blood is thicker than water.
[876.22 --> 876.86]  Have you heard that before?
[878.06 --> 879.00]  And the notion of that,
[879.08 --> 879.30]  of course,
[879.36 --> 880.68]  is that when there's
[880.68 --> 881.44]  moments of challenge
[881.44 --> 882.28]  or to make commitments
[882.28 --> 883.50]  to people you're loyal to,
[883.76 --> 884.66]  when push comes to shove,
[884.68 --> 885.46]  you're going to be loyal
[885.46 --> 886.20]  to your family,
[886.32 --> 887.28]  your blood relatives,
[887.40 --> 887.74]  your brothers,
[887.84 --> 888.14]  your sisters,
[888.22 --> 888.74]  your parents,
[889.00 --> 889.54]  that sense of like,
[889.64 --> 890.54]  these are my people.
[891.64 --> 892.90]  I think it's fair to say
[892.90 --> 894.42]  that when you become
[894.42 --> 895.60]  a Christian for the church,
[895.60 --> 896.42]  and this is definitely
[896.42 --> 897.44]  true throughout history,
[897.44 --> 900.12]  water is thicker than blood.
[901.66 --> 902.62]  That is to say,
[902.72 --> 903.38]  and especially thinking
[903.38 --> 904.14]  of the early church
[904.14 --> 904.88]  who were persecuted,
[905.28 --> 906.64]  sometimes by family members
[906.64 --> 907.32]  for their faith,
[907.72 --> 908.56]  that when you're baptized
[908.56 --> 910.26]  into the body of Christ,
[910.36 --> 911.38]  that becomes
[911.38 --> 913.52]  the most important thing
[913.52 --> 914.06]  about you.
[914.70 --> 916.34]  The most defining piece
[916.34 --> 916.82]  of your life
[916.82 --> 917.60]  is that you belong
[917.60 --> 918.78]  to this family.
[919.56 --> 920.64]  That's who you are.
[921.46 --> 922.54]  No longer matters
[922.54 --> 923.66]  the kind of status
[923.66 --> 924.02]  you have,
[924.06 --> 924.50]  your gender,
[924.68 --> 925.18]  your ethnicity,
[925.18 --> 926.00]  your power,
[926.36 --> 927.62]  the way people perceive you,
[927.98 --> 929.56]  you are part of the church.
[930.82 --> 931.74]  And let me ask you again,
[931.82 --> 933.76]  is that how you think about
[933.76 --> 936.46]  and live as a member
[936.46 --> 936.98]  of the body?
[937.42 --> 938.30]  Or do you see it
[938.30 --> 939.60]  like so many Western people
[939.60 --> 940.66]  as a collection,
[940.78 --> 941.56]  the church is a collection
[941.56 --> 942.16]  of individuals
[942.16 --> 943.64]  who believe the same things
[943.64 --> 944.80]  and they gather for worship
[944.80 --> 946.26]  to share and speak
[946.26 --> 946.98]  the things they believe
[946.98 --> 947.94]  about Jesus individually?
[949.30 --> 950.22]  Or do you see it
[950.22 --> 951.68]  as the primary identity
[951.68 --> 952.52]  of God's people
[952.52 --> 954.36]  that defines who we are,
[954.36 --> 955.36]  what we do,
[955.76 --> 956.40]  how we act?
[959.64 --> 960.48]  Now perhaps there's
[960.48 --> 961.34]  some introverts among us
[961.34 --> 961.56]  who are like,
[961.66 --> 962.92]  man, this is a big ask.
[964.12 --> 965.36]  Being committed to
[965.36 --> 966.54]  and invested in
[966.54 --> 967.40]  and having your identity
[967.40 --> 968.10]  as part of this
[968.10 --> 969.76]  very complex thing
[969.76 --> 970.80]  called the body of Christ,
[970.88 --> 971.78]  the community of faith.
[972.66 --> 973.52]  But I want to underscore
[973.52 --> 974.50]  that in this passage
[974.50 --> 976.00]  and all throughout the Bible,
[976.46 --> 977.56]  this is good news.
[978.32 --> 979.24]  I don't know if you know this,
[979.32 --> 980.24]  but you and I
[980.24 --> 980.74]  and everyone
[980.74 --> 982.14]  who's ever been created
[982.14 --> 984.06]  is created for community.
[984.96 --> 985.38]  In fact,
[985.54 --> 986.10]  one of the things
[986.10 --> 987.06]  I hope this pandemic
[987.06 --> 988.44]  is teaching every one of us
[988.44 --> 990.46]  is that we do not thrive,
[990.54 --> 991.54]  we do not flourish
[991.54 --> 992.62]  in isolation.
[993.44 --> 994.24]  I don't know too many people
[994.24 --> 994.54]  right now
[994.54 --> 995.42]  who are flourishing
[995.42 --> 996.14]  in isolation
[996.14 --> 997.72]  without the community of faith,
[997.78 --> 998.20]  without people
[998.20 --> 999.18]  walking with them,
[999.34 --> 1000.22]  grieving with them,
[1000.38 --> 1001.06]  working with them,
[1001.20 --> 1001.90]  praying with them.
[1002.06 --> 1003.08]  It's not an easy season
[1003.08 --> 1004.24]  because we were created
[1004.24 --> 1005.40]  for community.
[1005.80 --> 1006.96]  And when Jesus pulls us
[1006.96 --> 1007.68]  into apprenticeship,
[1007.94 --> 1008.70]  he pulls us into
[1008.70 --> 1009.48]  the kind of community
[1009.48 --> 1010.56]  that will form us
[1010.56 --> 1011.42]  to become the people
[1011.42 --> 1012.76]  God created us to be.
[1012.76 --> 1016.18]  A few months ago,
[1016.32 --> 1016.76]  Brittany and I
[1016.76 --> 1018.36]  watched the TV series
[1018.36 --> 1019.26]  The Queen's Gambit.
[1019.62 --> 1020.68]  I'm sure there's a few others
[1020.68 --> 1021.34]  who have watched it.
[1021.42 --> 1021.88]  It was recommended
[1021.88 --> 1022.60]  by many people
[1022.60 --> 1023.68]  in my own church here.
[1024.48 --> 1025.22]  And it's a story
[1025.22 --> 1026.34]  about this young woman
[1026.34 --> 1027.18]  named Beth Harmon,
[1027.18 --> 1030.20]  and she's a chess genius.
[1030.66 --> 1031.64]  And it tells a story
[1031.64 --> 1032.54]  of how when she was a kid,
[1032.62 --> 1033.38]  her father left
[1033.38 --> 1033.78]  and her mother
[1033.78 --> 1035.04]  was in this tragic car accident.
[1035.44 --> 1036.78]  She was put in this orphanage
[1036.78 --> 1037.78]  and in this orphanage
[1037.78 --> 1038.70]  she learned how to play chess
[1038.70 --> 1039.78]  with the janitor.
[1040.80 --> 1041.82]  But part of her journey
[1041.82 --> 1042.94]  is also the brokenness
[1042.94 --> 1043.96]  and trauma and grief
[1043.96 --> 1044.60]  that she experienced
[1044.60 --> 1045.42]  with all the loss.
[1045.54 --> 1046.52]  And at this orphanage,
[1046.74 --> 1047.70]  she develops this addiction
[1047.70 --> 1048.82]  to these tranquilizers.
[1049.48 --> 1050.52]  And these tranquilizers
[1050.52 --> 1052.66]  actually help her play chess.
[1052.74 --> 1053.58]  She sort of envisions
[1053.58 --> 1054.28]  on the ceiling
[1054.28 --> 1055.12]  these chess pieces
[1055.12 --> 1056.42]  and strategizes
[1056.42 --> 1057.26]  in the middle of the night
[1057.26 --> 1058.28]  and then she becomes better
[1058.28 --> 1059.14]  and better and better
[1059.14 --> 1059.72]  at chess.
[1060.22 --> 1061.24]  And the narrative, of course,
[1061.34 --> 1062.90]  traces her incredible gift
[1062.90 --> 1064.18]  and her skill at chess,
[1064.30 --> 1065.18]  beating all these men
[1065.18 --> 1065.88]  who've never been beat
[1065.88 --> 1066.34]  by a woman.
[1066.76 --> 1067.62]  But it also traces
[1067.62 --> 1069.64]  this incredibly broken journey
[1069.64 --> 1071.60]  where she's managing addiction.
[1071.78 --> 1072.48]  She's managing
[1072.48 --> 1074.06]  all the pain of loss.
[1074.34 --> 1075.06]  And you almost feel
[1075.06 --> 1075.90]  that all these moments
[1075.90 --> 1077.46]  she's just spin out of control.
[1078.32 --> 1078.90]  And I won't give away
[1078.90 --> 1080.82]  how this whole TV series ends,
[1080.90 --> 1081.56]  but I will say
[1081.56 --> 1083.18]  one of the main ways
[1083.18 --> 1084.02]  it wants to communicate
[1084.02 --> 1084.52]  is saying,
[1084.52 --> 1087.08]  we need community.
[1088.10 --> 1089.60]  You cannot thrive
[1089.60 --> 1091.16]  or even live well
[1091.16 --> 1092.14]  without community.
[1093.00 --> 1094.16]  And how much more
[1094.16 --> 1094.90]  that is the case
[1094.90 --> 1095.48]  for apprentices.
[1096.12 --> 1098.42]  We need the body of Christ.
[1098.54 --> 1099.64]  We were created
[1099.64 --> 1101.26]  to live and thrive
[1101.26 --> 1102.38]  and flourish
[1102.38 --> 1104.34]  as members of this body.
[1105.74 --> 1106.70]  And notice
[1106.70 --> 1107.96]  how the spirit
[1107.96 --> 1108.56]  in this passage
[1108.56 --> 1109.12]  is linked
[1109.12 --> 1110.66]  to the wider body.
[1111.38 --> 1111.50]  You know,
[1111.54 --> 1112.20]  whenever Paul talks
[1112.20 --> 1112.64]  about the spirit,
[1112.74 --> 1113.92]  there's a few exceptions
[1113.92 --> 1114.44]  to this.
[1115.04 --> 1116.00]  But he's always talking
[1116.00 --> 1116.98]  about the community
[1116.98 --> 1117.42]  of believers,
[1117.54 --> 1119.02]  the body of all the people
[1119.02 --> 1120.10]  operating and working together.
[1120.20 --> 1121.58]  The spirit is operative
[1121.58 --> 1122.64]  in and through
[1122.64 --> 1123.66]  that community.
[1124.60 --> 1125.68]  As believers work together,
[1125.82 --> 1126.24]  live together,
[1126.38 --> 1127.06]  break bread together,
[1127.34 --> 1128.24]  serve together,
[1128.38 --> 1128.92]  grow together,
[1128.92 --> 1129.90]  that's where the spirit
[1129.90 --> 1130.58]  is operating.
[1130.80 --> 1131.96]  Only a few times
[1131.96 --> 1132.48]  in the New Testament
[1132.48 --> 1133.24]  is the spirit talked about
[1133.24 --> 1134.10]  in an individual,
[1134.30 --> 1134.80]  personal way,
[1134.86 --> 1135.40]  which is true.
[1136.24 --> 1137.00]  But Paul talks about
[1137.00 --> 1137.82]  the body here
[1137.82 --> 1139.62]  as being this community
[1139.62 --> 1140.38]  wherein the spirit
[1140.38 --> 1141.30]  is poured out
[1141.30 --> 1141.92]  and operating.
[1142.40 --> 1143.54]  And if that's true,
[1143.88 --> 1145.18]  then extracting yourself
[1145.18 --> 1146.68]  from or isolating yourself
[1146.68 --> 1147.40]  from the body
[1147.40 --> 1148.98]  is to extract yourself
[1148.98 --> 1149.82]  and isolate yourself
[1149.82 --> 1150.78]  from the very work
[1150.78 --> 1151.60]  of the Holy Spirit.
[1152.14 --> 1152.96]  Think about that.
[1153.70 --> 1154.98]  That's a really dangerous
[1154.98 --> 1155.62]  thing to do.
[1156.28 --> 1156.92]  You want to experience
[1156.92 --> 1157.70]  the life of the spirit?
[1157.96 --> 1159.24]  Be grafted into this family.
[1159.30 --> 1160.00]  You want to experience
[1160.00 --> 1161.34]  the absence of the work
[1161.34 --> 1161.80]  of the spirit
[1161.80 --> 1162.72]  or sort of
[1162.72 --> 1163.60]  a stulting of that?
[1164.08 --> 1164.94]  Then remove yourself
[1164.94 --> 1165.32]  from it.
[1168.28 --> 1169.42]  In our membership classes
[1169.42 --> 1169.86]  at Hope,
[1170.12 --> 1170.96]  the last number of years,
[1171.78 --> 1172.76]  when we talk about
[1172.76 --> 1173.60]  what it means to serve
[1173.60 --> 1174.38]  and be part of the church,
[1174.46 --> 1175.20]  we ask the question
[1175.20 --> 1175.84]  to people coming
[1175.84 --> 1176.28]  into our church,
[1176.34 --> 1176.56]  we say,
[1176.80 --> 1177.60]  describe a time,
[1177.70 --> 1178.34]  sit around a table,
[1178.80 --> 1179.50]  describe a time
[1179.50 --> 1180.24]  to those around you
[1180.24 --> 1181.50]  where you have grown
[1181.50 --> 1182.64]  in your faith.
[1182.70 --> 1183.60]  A time where you sort of
[1183.60 --> 1184.46]  caught your stride
[1184.46 --> 1184.96]  as a believer,
[1185.08 --> 1185.54]  you really sense
[1185.54 --> 1186.60]  the spirit working in you,
[1186.84 --> 1187.52]  and we just spend
[1187.52 --> 1188.56]  10 minutes talking about that.
[1188.60 --> 1189.20]  And that conversation
[1189.20 --> 1189.86]  is worth the whole
[1189.86 --> 1190.76]  membership class for me.
[1191.52 --> 1192.32]  Then we come back
[1192.32 --> 1192.64]  and we say,
[1192.72 --> 1192.86]  okay,
[1193.00 --> 1193.84]  what did you hear
[1193.84 --> 1194.70]  people sharing about
[1194.70 --> 1195.46]  the times where they're
[1195.46 --> 1196.38]  really growing in the faith?
[1196.94 --> 1197.34]  Always,
[1197.70 --> 1198.46]  invariably,
[1198.58 --> 1199.36]  the answers are
[1199.36 --> 1200.78]  the body of Christ.
[1201.42 --> 1202.32]  Always people sharing
[1202.32 --> 1203.32]  that time where they served
[1203.32 --> 1204.58]  on a mission trip together
[1204.58 --> 1205.84]  with friends of theirs
[1205.84 --> 1206.36]  from school.
[1206.78 --> 1208.02]  Or they were serving together
[1208.02 --> 1208.76]  at the community kitchen
[1208.76 --> 1209.64]  or they're working together.
[1209.74 --> 1211.08]  Someone came alongside them
[1211.08 --> 1211.62]  in their grief
[1211.62 --> 1212.16]  and their pain
[1212.16 --> 1212.88]  and encouraged them.
[1213.14 --> 1214.34]  It's always community.
[1215.00 --> 1215.92]  The spirit of God
[1215.92 --> 1217.30]  working through the body
[1217.30 --> 1218.34]  in the same way
[1218.34 --> 1218.96]  that Paul says,
[1219.18 --> 1219.88]  that's how the spirit
[1219.88 --> 1220.62]  always works.
[1220.62 --> 1224.10]  You were not meant
[1224.10 --> 1226.30]  to do apprenticeship
[1226.30 --> 1227.54]  on your own.
[1228.24 --> 1229.12]  And it's doomed
[1229.12 --> 1229.80]  for failure
[1229.80 --> 1230.60]  without the body.
[1231.64 --> 1231.92]  I mean,
[1232.12 --> 1233.32]  you're an amazing
[1233.32 --> 1234.16]  group of people,
[1234.66 --> 1235.80]  but none of us
[1235.80 --> 1237.40]  have nearly
[1237.40 --> 1238.10]  what it takes
[1238.10 --> 1239.22]  to grow.
[1240.58 --> 1241.08]  I mean,
[1241.12 --> 1242.12]  there's a lot of metaphors
[1242.12 --> 1242.86]  I could use,
[1243.26 --> 1243.82]  but one metaphor
[1243.82 --> 1244.32]  I'll use,
[1244.44 --> 1245.28]  I'll steal from Ben
[1245.28 --> 1245.86]  as a cellist.
[1245.96 --> 1246.92]  We pick on Ben a lot
[1246.92 --> 1247.98]  with our sermon illustrations.
[1248.96 --> 1249.54]  Sorry, Ben.
[1249.54 --> 1250.90]  I didn't get his permission
[1250.90 --> 1251.24]  for this,
[1251.32 --> 1252.42]  but when we first moved to BC,
[1252.56 --> 1253.42]  Brittany and I moved to BC,
[1253.90 --> 1254.96]  Ben was finishing up
[1254.96 --> 1256.98]  his Masters in Cello performance
[1256.98 --> 1257.82]  at UBC,
[1258.38 --> 1259.16]  and we had the privilege
[1259.16 --> 1259.92]  of every now and then
[1259.92 --> 1261.08]  when there was a free weekend,
[1261.18 --> 1262.06]  we'd go to his concerts.
[1262.76 --> 1263.98]  And Ben would be up there
[1263.98 --> 1264.92]  and we were so proud of him
[1264.92 --> 1265.76]  just knowing someone
[1265.76 --> 1266.78]  who's so good at the cello.
[1267.36 --> 1268.36]  And if we were early enough,
[1268.40 --> 1269.42]  which was rarely the case,
[1269.48 --> 1270.64]  we got to hear them tune up.
[1271.08 --> 1271.60]  And if you've been
[1271.60 --> 1272.62]  to an orchestra performance,
[1272.72 --> 1273.24]  you'll know that
[1273.24 --> 1274.20]  it's a very interesting thing
[1274.20 --> 1275.16]  to hear all these instruments
[1275.16 --> 1275.86]  slowly tuning
[1275.86 --> 1276.76]  and it sounds like noise
[1276.76 --> 1277.92]  and then slowly
[1277.92 --> 1278.92]  it becomes harmony.
[1279.94 --> 1281.48]  But if you were there
[1281.48 --> 1282.42]  and you hear them tuning up,
[1282.48 --> 1283.38]  there's certain instruments
[1283.38 --> 1283.82]  where you're like,
[1284.02 --> 1285.86]  hmm, that kind of sounds weird.
[1286.54 --> 1287.36]  And you hear them all
[1287.36 --> 1287.68]  tuning up,
[1287.72 --> 1287.84]  you're like,
[1287.88 --> 1288.44]  man, I'm so glad
[1288.44 --> 1289.14]  I didn't come just
[1289.14 --> 1290.18]  to hear the bassoon.
[1290.92 --> 1291.86]  No offense to the bassoon.
[1292.20 --> 1292.98]  Or the timpani.
[1293.32 --> 1294.34]  No offense to the timpani.
[1294.90 --> 1296.76]  But as all these instruments,
[1296.88 --> 1297.66]  some of which I don't think
[1297.66 --> 1298.78]  sound very good by themselves,
[1299.04 --> 1300.20]  as they all come together
[1300.20 --> 1301.32]  in the orchestra
[1301.32 --> 1302.24]  and you hear it,
[1302.62 --> 1303.54]  it's stunning.
[1304.26 --> 1304.96]  It's harmony.
[1305.46 --> 1306.48]  It's beauty.
[1306.48 --> 1308.42]  And so it is
[1308.42 --> 1309.38]  with the body of Christ.
[1310.06 --> 1311.42]  You have your gift,
[1311.68 --> 1312.72]  you play your instrument,
[1312.88 --> 1313.82]  you have your part.
[1314.26 --> 1315.38]  By itself,
[1316.12 --> 1317.10]  it will not sing.
[1317.20 --> 1318.32]  But when you draw that
[1318.32 --> 1319.14]  into the symphony
[1319.14 --> 1320.06]  of the church
[1320.06 --> 1321.02]  of Jesus Christ,
[1321.40 --> 1322.16]  it sings,
[1322.36 --> 1322.82]  the melody
[1322.82 --> 1323.98]  of the kingdom of God.
[1325.90 --> 1327.00]  That is what it means
[1327.00 --> 1328.14]  to be the body of Christ.
[1328.14 --> 1332.94]  Now I need to be honest,
[1333.00 --> 1334.02]  if you look at this passage,
[1334.44 --> 1335.90]  what you can't avoid
[1335.90 --> 1336.78]  is how difficult
[1336.78 --> 1338.06]  and hard
[1338.06 --> 1339.22]  and rare
[1339.22 --> 1340.58]  this kind of community is.
[1340.90 --> 1341.82]  It's easy to talk
[1341.82 --> 1342.50]  in ideals
[1342.50 --> 1343.50]  about what it means
[1343.50 --> 1344.48]  to be the body of Christ
[1344.48 --> 1345.04]  and the beauty
[1345.04 --> 1345.72]  of growing together
[1345.72 --> 1346.42]  and serving together,
[1346.70 --> 1347.86]  but I know a lot of us
[1347.86 --> 1348.40]  have experienced
[1348.40 --> 1349.14]  the opposite.
[1350.22 --> 1351.20]  And I've met people
[1351.20 --> 1352.06]  who come to our church,
[1352.16 --> 1353.18]  they're new to the Christian faith,
[1353.28 --> 1353.96]  they haven't really been
[1353.96 --> 1354.70]  part of a church before
[1354.70 --> 1355.58]  and they're stoked.
[1355.90 --> 1356.52]  They can't wait
[1356.52 --> 1357.16]  to get involved
[1357.16 --> 1358.00]  and use their gifts
[1358.00 --> 1358.96]  and get to know the church
[1358.96 --> 1359.80]  and as a leader
[1359.80 --> 1360.30]  you want to say,
[1360.40 --> 1360.58]  okay,
[1360.78 --> 1361.94]  I don't know how
[1361.94 --> 1362.60]  to tell you this,
[1362.72 --> 1364.20]  but there's going to be
[1364.20 --> 1364.54]  some people
[1364.54 --> 1365.40]  who drive you crazy.
[1366.28 --> 1366.60]  There's going to be
[1366.60 --> 1367.16]  some ministries
[1367.16 --> 1367.74]  that don't go
[1367.74 --> 1368.32]  the way you want.
[1368.38 --> 1368.68]  There's going to be
[1368.68 --> 1369.60]  leaders who make decisions
[1369.60 --> 1370.78]  that you get frustrated by
[1370.78 --> 1371.52]  and there's just going
[1371.52 --> 1372.10]  to be those people
[1372.10 --> 1372.40]  you're like,
[1372.58 --> 1372.82]  man,
[1373.30 --> 1374.40]  how are they
[1374.40 --> 1375.56]  part of the body of Christ?
[1376.12 --> 1376.98]  And just to humble you,
[1377.04 --> 1377.76]  there's people who will say
[1377.76 --> 1378.54]  that about you too.
[1378.94 --> 1379.36]  They'll look at you
[1379.36 --> 1379.56]  and say,
[1379.62 --> 1380.16]  oh man,
[1380.22 --> 1380.84]  I don't know why
[1380.84 --> 1381.34]  they do that.
[1381.38 --> 1382.24]  It's so frustrating.
[1382.74 --> 1383.74]  And there are so many
[1383.74 --> 1384.34]  temptations
[1384.34 --> 1385.92]  and sometimes reasons
[1385.92 --> 1386.42]  people give
[1386.42 --> 1388.00]  to leave the church.
[1388.98 --> 1389.96]  So many people
[1389.96 --> 1391.10]  as they experience
[1391.10 --> 1392.02]  the messiness
[1392.02 --> 1392.70]  of the church
[1392.70 --> 1393.48]  and it is
[1393.48 --> 1394.84]  a beautiful mess.
[1394.90 --> 1395.12]  Say,
[1395.52 --> 1396.18]  I don't know if I could
[1396.18 --> 1397.78]  do this hard road.
[1398.72 --> 1399.38]  Sometimes it feels
[1399.38 --> 1400.00]  like a graph
[1400.00 --> 1400.84]  if I could sort of
[1400.84 --> 1401.60]  give you a curve,
[1401.74 --> 1402.60]  a bell curve down
[1402.60 --> 1403.22]  and then up again.
[1403.48 --> 1404.72]  When you start in a church,
[1405.08 --> 1406.18]  you seem to be so excited
[1406.18 --> 1406.98]  about the possibilities
[1406.98 --> 1407.44]  of community.
[1407.52 --> 1408.26]  Then you get to know
[1408.26 --> 1409.14]  the brokenness,
[1409.54 --> 1410.12]  some of the stuff
[1410.12 --> 1410.62]  that happens,
[1410.74 --> 1411.16]  some of the stuff
[1411.16 --> 1412.02]  that no one knows about
[1412.02 --> 1413.94]  and you get so disenchanted.
[1414.60 --> 1414.88]  And you think,
[1414.96 --> 1415.80]  is this the church?
[1416.42 --> 1417.26]  And then I think
[1417.26 --> 1417.70]  what happens
[1417.70 --> 1418.72]  if you stay
[1418.72 --> 1420.44]  and you are committed,
[1421.04 --> 1422.06]  you see the beauty,
[1422.26 --> 1423.22]  you grow together,
[1423.36 --> 1424.32]  you serve with your gifts
[1424.32 --> 1425.10]  and you receive
[1425.10 --> 1425.94]  the gifts of that body
[1425.94 --> 1426.90]  and you see
[1426.90 --> 1428.02]  what Christ intended
[1428.02 --> 1429.28]  for his family.
[1431.78 --> 1432.68]  I want to read for you
[1432.68 --> 1433.38]  a quote that comes
[1433.38 --> 1433.76]  from a book
[1433.76 --> 1434.92]  called Slow Church
[1434.92 --> 1435.82]  and the title
[1435.82 --> 1436.22]  of that book
[1436.22 --> 1437.70]  itself intrigues me
[1437.70 --> 1438.58]  in our fast-paced,
[1438.72 --> 1439.32]  splashy,
[1439.84 --> 1441.78]  always-on-the-move context.
[1442.64 --> 1443.84]  The authors Christopher Smith
[1443.84 --> 1444.58]  and John Pattinson
[1444.58 --> 1445.06]  write this
[1445.06 --> 1446.24]  about spiritual formation.
[1446.42 --> 1447.42]  They write,
[1447.62 --> 1449.46]  spiritual formation occurs
[1449.46 --> 1451.64]  primarily in the context
[1451.64 --> 1452.14]  of community,
[1452.22 --> 1452.86]  what we've been saying.
[1453.30 --> 1454.66]  Long-term interpersonal
[1454.66 --> 1455.24]  relationships
[1455.24 --> 1456.64]  are the crucible
[1456.64 --> 1458.32]  for genuine progress
[1458.32 --> 1459.20]  in the Christian life.
[1459.56 --> 1460.78]  People who stay
[1460.78 --> 1461.72]  grow.
[1462.60 --> 1464.14]  People who leave
[1464.14 --> 1465.46]  do not grow.
[1465.84 --> 1466.64]  It is a simple
[1466.64 --> 1467.38]  but profound
[1467.38 --> 1468.34]  biblical reality
[1468.34 --> 1469.36]  that we both grow
[1469.36 --> 1470.30]  and thrive together
[1470.30 --> 1472.46]  or we do not grow
[1472.46 --> 1473.46]  much at all.
[1473.46 --> 1475.72]  What do you think
[1475.72 --> 1476.22]  of that quote?
[1477.70 --> 1478.88]  It brings two things
[1478.88 --> 1479.40]  up for me.
[1479.58 --> 1480.08]  One is,
[1480.92 --> 1481.52]  it's not just
[1481.52 --> 1482.44]  any community
[1482.44 --> 1483.78]  where we grow
[1483.78 --> 1484.24]  in deep,
[1484.40 --> 1485.30]  Christ-forming ways.
[1485.40 --> 1486.04]  It's intentional,
[1486.58 --> 1487.02]  meaningful,
[1487.64 --> 1489.06]  long-term community
[1489.06 --> 1490.46]  in the body of Christ.
[1491.46 --> 1492.06]  And secondly,
[1492.44 --> 1494.06]  it's over a long
[1494.06 --> 1495.06]  period of time.
[1496.20 --> 1497.14]  And when I read that quote,
[1497.20 --> 1497.82]  what comes to mind
[1497.82 --> 1498.36]  to me
[1498.36 --> 1499.92]  is how we can have
[1499.92 --> 1500.74]  all sorts of strange
[1500.74 --> 1501.82]  ideas about community
[1501.82 --> 1503.46]  and all sorts of strange,
[1503.58 --> 1504.04]  I don't know how else
[1504.04 --> 1504.34]  to put it,
[1504.38 --> 1505.16]  but deceptions
[1505.16 --> 1507.26]  about where our community is.
[1507.56 --> 1508.62]  And I've seen this play out
[1508.62 --> 1509.20]  in a variety of ways.
[1509.26 --> 1510.02]  I'll give two examples.
[1511.18 --> 1511.36]  In,
[1512.12 --> 1512.68]  over the years,
[1512.76 --> 1513.36]  I've noticed that,
[1513.50 --> 1514.20]  especially for men
[1514.20 --> 1514.94]  and not always for men
[1514.94 --> 1515.84]  but often for men,
[1516.04 --> 1517.12]  the primary community
[1517.12 --> 1517.96]  is work.
[1518.68 --> 1519.54]  You've got colleagues,
[1519.66 --> 1520.34]  people you work with,
[1520.40 --> 1521.54]  you do jobs together,
[1521.66 --> 1522.14]  share tasks,
[1522.22 --> 1523.12]  there's a sense of meaningful,
[1523.46 --> 1524.08]  fulfilling things
[1524.08 --> 1524.76]  and that's good.
[1525.18 --> 1526.02]  And then what happens
[1526.02 --> 1527.66]  is they retire
[1527.66 --> 1529.12]  and they enter
[1529.12 --> 1530.40]  into a crisis of
[1530.40 --> 1532.12]  what is my community?
[1532.58 --> 1533.70]  And all those years
[1533.70 --> 1534.90]  as work was the primary community,
[1534.96 --> 1536.04]  they did not really give time
[1536.04 --> 1536.48]  or attention
[1536.48 --> 1537.30]  to any relationship
[1537.30 --> 1537.80]  in the church
[1537.80 --> 1538.86]  and then they find themselves
[1538.86 --> 1540.28]  in this weird no man's land
[1540.28 --> 1540.64]  of like,
[1540.88 --> 1541.94]  who am I now?
[1542.50 --> 1543.12]  And what is it,
[1543.26 --> 1544.28]  like what is my community?
[1544.60 --> 1545.96]  That happens for so many people
[1545.96 --> 1546.50]  when they retire
[1546.50 --> 1547.48]  and in my mind,
[1547.52 --> 1547.98]  it's one of the reasons
[1547.98 --> 1549.38]  people are afraid to retire.
[1550.34 --> 1551.72]  That's one generation's challenge
[1551.72 --> 1552.10]  with community.
[1552.30 --> 1553.12]  Here's another one
[1553.12 --> 1553.56]  for people,
[1553.78 --> 1554.64]  millennials and younger.
[1555.42 --> 1556.58]  I don't really need the church
[1556.58 --> 1558.74]  because I've got digital community.
[1559.76 --> 1560.88]  I've got so many friends
[1560.88 --> 1561.34]  on Facebook,
[1561.48 --> 1562.44]  I've got so many messages
[1562.44 --> 1563.58]  in my Instagram account,
[1563.76 --> 1564.96]  I've got more group chats
[1564.96 --> 1565.88]  that I know what to do with,
[1565.94 --> 1567.92]  I am so busy interacting
[1567.92 --> 1569.16]  and talking with people online,
[1569.24 --> 1569.72]  I'm good.
[1570.02 --> 1571.12]  I don't need to be part
[1571.12 --> 1571.66]  of this thing called
[1571.66 --> 1573.22]  the body of Christ in person.
[1574.32 --> 1575.34]  I just want to ask the question,
[1576.26 --> 1577.30]  is that community?
[1578.36 --> 1579.66]  Is that what we're talking about
[1579.66 --> 1580.18]  when we talk about
[1580.18 --> 1580.84]  the body of Christ?
[1581.16 --> 1581.60]  First of all,
[1581.66 --> 1582.36]  do those people
[1582.36 --> 1583.32]  that you chat with online,
[1583.38 --> 1584.42]  do they know your soul?
[1585.14 --> 1586.40]  Will they be there in crisis
[1586.40 --> 1587.52]  and are you really growing
[1587.52 --> 1588.16]  as an apprentice
[1588.16 --> 1590.60]  of Jesus Christ with them?
[1591.84 --> 1592.84]  Ask that question.
[1594.26 --> 1595.26]  The kind of community
[1595.26 --> 1595.94]  we're talking about
[1595.94 --> 1596.58]  is intentional,
[1596.86 --> 1597.20]  meaningful,
[1597.58 --> 1599.50]  long-term growth
[1599.50 --> 1600.94]  as the family of Christ.
[1602.66 --> 1603.52]  And I think
[1603.52 --> 1604.76]  the Slow Church book
[1604.76 --> 1606.12]  puts their finger on one thing
[1606.12 --> 1606.78]  that no one seems
[1606.78 --> 1607.66]  to talk about in the West
[1607.66 --> 1608.28]  and that is
[1608.28 --> 1610.94]  slow over time.
[1612.30 --> 1613.58]  In previous generations,
[1613.58 --> 1615.30]  especially in the Catholic tradition,
[1615.46 --> 1616.04]  there were monks
[1616.04 --> 1617.66]  who would make what's called
[1617.66 --> 1618.86]  a vow of stability.
[1619.06 --> 1619.56]  You heard of that?
[1620.28 --> 1621.02]  The vow of stability
[1621.02 --> 1621.86]  was basically saying
[1621.86 --> 1622.34]  as they entered
[1622.34 --> 1623.60]  into a certain religious community,
[1623.68 --> 1623.86]  they'd say,
[1623.96 --> 1624.80]  no matter what comes,
[1625.18 --> 1625.82]  I'm here.
[1626.54 --> 1627.56]  These are my people,
[1627.96 --> 1628.96]  this is my place,
[1629.30 --> 1629.98]  this is the city
[1629.98 --> 1630.76]  I'm going to serve,
[1630.88 --> 1633.10]  and I am going to be here.
[1635.10 --> 1636.42]  That is so far
[1636.42 --> 1637.72]  from our context right now
[1637.72 --> 1639.16]  where many Christians
[1639.16 --> 1639.84]  come into a church
[1639.84 --> 1640.10]  and say,
[1640.10 --> 1640.98]  I will be here
[1640.98 --> 1642.00]  if I like this sermon,
[1642.12 --> 1642.78]  that worship team,
[1642.86 --> 1643.60]  this is my style,
[1643.68 --> 1644.68]  I like how these things are going.
[1644.88 --> 1646.04]  If it's not that way,
[1646.18 --> 1646.88]  I'm gone.
[1647.52 --> 1648.80]  Or I will be in this city
[1648.80 --> 1649.54]  unless I get a job
[1649.54 --> 1650.24]  that pays really well
[1650.24 --> 1650.60]  somewhere else
[1650.60 --> 1651.12]  and I'm gone.
[1651.52 --> 1652.20]  And we all know
[1652.20 --> 1652.72]  in Clayton,
[1652.78 --> 1653.26]  if you live here,
[1653.34 --> 1654.36]  there's a lot of transients
[1654.36 --> 1655.70]  in and out of community.
[1656.58 --> 1657.30]  And I think
[1657.30 --> 1658.74]  part of the reason
[1658.74 --> 1659.62]  we have some health
[1659.62 --> 1660.12]  in our community,
[1660.20 --> 1660.82]  we've got all sorts
[1660.82 --> 1661.72]  of dysfunction too,
[1662.18 --> 1663.04]  but the places
[1663.04 --> 1664.16]  where there are health,
[1664.30 --> 1664.76]  is health,
[1665.28 --> 1665.92]  are the places
[1665.92 --> 1666.72]  where there's stability.
[1667.72 --> 1668.62]  And I can't say that
[1668.62 --> 1668.76]  without,
[1668.88 --> 1669.70]  I see Sid and Candy
[1669.70 --> 1670.50]  sitting right in front of me,
[1670.74 --> 1671.54]  without naming the fact
[1671.54 --> 1672.34]  that they have been
[1672.34 --> 1674.28]  a stable presence
[1674.28 --> 1675.22]  in the church
[1675.22 --> 1677.10]  for 25 years.
[1677.92 --> 1678.76]  Many of those years,
[1678.80 --> 1679.14]  or I should say
[1679.14 --> 1679.84]  some of those years,
[1680.06 --> 1681.32]  there were hard things.
[1681.56 --> 1682.18]  I don't know if you know this,
[1682.22 --> 1682.76]  but in the history of Hope,
[1682.80 --> 1683.36]  they tried to plant
[1683.36 --> 1684.18]  two more churches.
[1684.56 --> 1685.26]  Two more churches.
[1685.68 --> 1686.14]  Both of them
[1686.14 --> 1687.40]  had very difficult struggles.
[1687.88 --> 1688.88]  And even in the midst
[1688.88 --> 1689.34]  of the pain
[1689.34 --> 1689.80]  of people saying,
[1689.86 --> 1690.20]  I'm done,
[1690.30 --> 1690.88]  I don't want to be part
[1690.88 --> 1691.46]  of this church plant,
[1691.66 --> 1692.30]  this is not the way
[1692.30 --> 1692.86]  I envisioned it,
[1692.90 --> 1693.40]  and they leave,
[1693.44 --> 1694.16]  or whatever happens,
[1694.28 --> 1694.88]  Sid and Candy
[1694.88 --> 1695.76]  and other people have said,
[1695.88 --> 1696.54]  we're here.
[1697.34 --> 1698.08]  We're the church.
[1698.40 --> 1699.04]  We're committed.
[1699.50 --> 1700.78]  We are the body of Christ.
[1700.96 --> 1701.52]  Is it easy?
[1701.64 --> 1702.40]  No, but we're here.
[1702.46 --> 1703.42]  And in that context
[1703.42 --> 1704.62]  of long-term relationships,
[1705.08 --> 1706.32]  that's where the change happens.
[1707.08 --> 1707.82]  And I want to say,
[1707.94 --> 1708.52]  as a challenge
[1708.52 --> 1709.24]  to all of us
[1709.24 --> 1709.98]  who are new,
[1710.04 --> 1710.70]  and many of us
[1710.70 --> 1711.52]  in this church are new,
[1712.00 --> 1712.72]  stick around.
[1713.80 --> 1714.78]  Recognize that real,
[1715.18 --> 1715.62]  formative,
[1715.82 --> 1716.96]  Christ-forming community
[1716.96 --> 1718.02]  takes time.
[1718.38 --> 1719.04]  It's slow.
[1719.26 --> 1719.72]  It's hard.
[1719.86 --> 1720.82]  It will be demanding,
[1721.28 --> 1722.36]  and yet it's beautiful.
[1722.36 --> 1726.72]  There is no such thing
[1726.72 --> 1727.60]  as solo apprenticeship.
[1728.56 --> 1729.22]  It's a misnomer.
[1729.34 --> 1730.04]  It doesn't exist.
[1730.16 --> 1730.66]  In the Old Testament,
[1730.74 --> 1731.20]  the New Testament,
[1731.32 --> 1731.92]  it's not what we're called
[1731.92 --> 1732.60]  to be as apprentices.
[1732.98 --> 1733.88]  When Christ calls us
[1733.88 --> 1734.42]  to follow Him,
[1734.46 --> 1734.74]  He says,
[1735.12 --> 1736.12]  you are grafted
[1736.12 --> 1737.68]  into my body.
[1737.74 --> 1738.96]  As you receive baptism,
[1739.74 --> 1740.48]  you are grafted
[1740.48 --> 1741.26]  into a family
[1741.26 --> 1742.40]  that defines your identity.
[1742.50 --> 1743.14]  You learn together,
[1743.26 --> 1743.84]  you grow together,
[1743.96 --> 1744.68]  you eat together,
[1744.68 --> 1745.86]  and you serve
[1745.86 --> 1747.06]  the city together.
[1748.70 --> 1749.46]  And I know there's
[1749.46 --> 1750.28]  at least a few of us
[1750.28 --> 1750.84]  who are probably thinking
[1750.84 --> 1751.18]  right now,
[1751.26 --> 1751.78]  wow, Dave,
[1751.86 --> 1752.82]  you're preaching on community
[1752.82 --> 1753.72]  during COVID
[1753.72 --> 1754.64]  when the building
[1754.64 --> 1755.66]  only has 10 people in it.
[1755.68 --> 1756.50]  We can't gather together.
[1756.56 --> 1757.42]  We can't go to each other's homes.
[1757.50 --> 1758.32]  We can't even share
[1758.32 --> 1758.84]  a meal together.
[1758.92 --> 1759.60]  Why would you preach
[1759.60 --> 1760.78]  on such a punishing text
[1760.78 --> 1761.68]  this morning?
[1761.72 --> 1762.46]  And I did wrestle
[1762.46 --> 1763.28]  with Pastor Sid.
[1763.36 --> 1764.34]  Should I save the sermon
[1764.34 --> 1764.88]  for later?
[1765.26 --> 1766.42]  And I don't think I should.
[1767.50 --> 1767.90]  In fact,
[1767.90 --> 1769.02]  I think I need to invite us
[1769.02 --> 1770.02]  to continue grappling.
[1771.10 --> 1771.66]  And maybe,
[1772.16 --> 1772.78]  just maybe,
[1773.10 --> 1774.52]  this is the perfect season
[1774.52 --> 1775.86]  to wrestle with
[1775.86 --> 1776.28]  what it means
[1776.28 --> 1777.28]  to be the body of Christ.
[1777.72 --> 1779.06]  As we are in many ways
[1779.06 --> 1780.38]  extracted by force
[1780.38 --> 1781.12]  and by the needs
[1781.12 --> 1781.70]  of the season
[1781.70 --> 1782.84]  and demands of the pandemic,
[1783.16 --> 1784.68]  we now get to wrestle with
[1784.68 --> 1786.14]  how much we need
[1786.14 --> 1787.02]  the body of Christ.
[1788.88 --> 1789.72]  Last March,
[1789.96 --> 1790.56]  when the shutdown
[1790.56 --> 1791.20]  first happened,
[1791.24 --> 1791.70]  I was sitting with
[1791.70 --> 1792.64]  a group of church leaders
[1792.64 --> 1794.04]  and one of those leaders,
[1794.14 --> 1794.72]  a friend of mine,
[1794.80 --> 1795.06]  said,
[1795.56 --> 1796.28]  I really hope
[1796.28 --> 1797.04]  we don't rush
[1797.04 --> 1797.92]  to get back to normal.
[1798.92 --> 1800.00]  Hope we don't just race
[1800.00 --> 1800.64]  to get things
[1800.64 --> 1801.32]  the same way
[1801.32 --> 1802.10]  they were before.
[1802.26 --> 1803.50]  I hope we take the time
[1803.50 --> 1804.48]  and learn
[1804.48 --> 1805.16]  what Christ
[1805.16 --> 1805.92]  has to teach
[1805.92 --> 1806.52]  the church
[1806.52 --> 1807.70]  through this pandemic.
[1809.20 --> 1810.12]  Could it be
[1810.12 --> 1812.00]  that one of those things
[1812.00 --> 1813.60]  is a commitment
[1813.60 --> 1815.26]  to the body of Christ?
[1816.26 --> 1817.02]  Could it be
[1817.02 --> 1818.34]  a final acceptance
[1818.34 --> 1818.80]  of the fact
[1818.80 --> 1820.10]  that your solo apprenticeship,
[1820.24 --> 1820.96]  however long you've tried
[1820.96 --> 1821.66]  to do this on your own,
[1821.78 --> 1823.06]  is a failed project
[1823.06 --> 1824.72]  and what you need
[1824.72 --> 1826.76]  is the body of Christ?
[1827.96 --> 1828.74]  And I have to say
[1828.74 --> 1829.52]  there's two things
[1829.52 --> 1830.30]  in the last couple weeks
[1830.30 --> 1831.06]  that have encouraged me.
[1831.84 --> 1832.76]  They may feel small,
[1832.86 --> 1833.84]  but I think they say something.
[1834.48 --> 1835.02]  Two weeks ago
[1835.02 --> 1835.76]  we had an elders meeting
[1835.76 --> 1837.08]  which for many, many weeks,
[1837.16 --> 1837.58]  many months
[1837.58 --> 1838.26]  we've had on Zoom.
[1838.64 --> 1839.22]  We are allowed
[1839.22 --> 1839.94]  to have them in person.
[1840.04 --> 1840.54]  We're under 10
[1840.54 --> 1841.62]  and so one elder said,
[1841.96 --> 1843.32]  hey, can we do this meeting
[1843.32 --> 1843.74]  in person?
[1844.70 --> 1846.52]  And after that email was sent,
[1846.64 --> 1847.76]  it was the day of the meeting,
[1847.88 --> 1848.16]  it was like
[1848.16 --> 1850.62]  email after email
[1850.62 --> 1851.18]  from different elders
[1851.18 --> 1851.84]  saying I'll be there,
[1852.00 --> 1852.44]  can't wait,
[1852.54 --> 1853.20]  looking forward to it,
[1853.36 --> 1854.10]  what do you want me to bring?
[1854.48 --> 1854.82]  And I was like,
[1854.88 --> 1855.76]  whoa, this is not the kind
[1855.76 --> 1856.20]  of elders meeting
[1856.20 --> 1857.34]  I'm used to getting emails for.
[1857.64 --> 1858.70]  And then we had our meeting
[1858.70 --> 1859.48]  around the table,
[1859.64 --> 1860.28]  mass, distance,
[1860.28 --> 1860.90]  all the rest
[1860.90 --> 1861.76]  and we spent so much
[1861.76 --> 1862.46]  of our time praying,
[1863.48 --> 1864.10]  checking in,
[1864.82 --> 1865.62]  recognizing how much
[1865.62 --> 1866.94]  we need each other
[1866.94 --> 1868.24]  as leaders in the church.
[1868.38 --> 1869.24]  It was beautiful.
[1870.26 --> 1870.90]  Last week,
[1870.96 --> 1871.64]  after the service,
[1871.74 --> 1872.60]  we had a garbage cleanup.
[1872.68 --> 1873.32]  Usually that's just
[1873.32 --> 1874.46]  a small handful of people.
[1874.80 --> 1875.62]  We had more people
[1875.62 --> 1876.66]  than we knew what to do with
[1876.66 --> 1877.42]  for the garbage cleanup
[1877.42 --> 1877.96]  last week
[1877.96 --> 1878.96]  and I kind of joked
[1878.96 --> 1879.74]  with Brittany
[1879.74 --> 1880.50]  when I got home,
[1880.84 --> 1881.46]  it's like we were
[1881.46 --> 1882.26]  so desperate
[1882.26 --> 1883.40]  to be with our friends
[1883.40 --> 1884.36]  and our fellow believers
[1884.36 --> 1884.78]  that we're like,
[1884.84 --> 1885.22]  you know what?
[1885.22 --> 1886.64]  I'll clean up garbage
[1886.64 --> 1887.72]  if I could do it
[1887.72 --> 1888.52]  with my friends.
[1888.88 --> 1890.16]  I will go on the street
[1890.16 --> 1891.02]  and I will pick up litter
[1891.02 --> 1892.06]  and I'm so thankful
[1892.06 --> 1893.00]  we get to do this together.
[1893.38 --> 1894.54]  Yes, we're part of the church.
[1895.70 --> 1897.12]  I wonder if
[1897.12 --> 1899.16]  Christ is giving us
[1899.16 --> 1899.76]  a hunger
[1899.76 --> 1901.28]  for deep,
[1901.56 --> 1902.02]  meaningful,
[1902.38 --> 1903.38]  long-term community.
[1904.38 --> 1905.16]  And I wonder if
[1905.16 --> 1906.26]  He's preparing us
[1906.26 --> 1907.44]  for regathering
[1907.44 --> 1908.78]  with a renewed commitment
[1908.78 --> 1910.56]  to the body of Christ.
[1910.56 --> 1914.22]  Let me finish
[1914.22 --> 1915.24]  by saying this.
[1917.64 --> 1919.04]  The shared life
[1919.04 --> 1919.72]  of the church
[1919.72 --> 1921.06]  is not only
[1921.06 --> 1921.56]  what we're called
[1921.56 --> 1922.42]  to be as the body
[1922.42 --> 1922.96]  of Christ
[1922.96 --> 1924.60]  when we apprentice
[1924.60 --> 1925.12]  with Jesus,
[1926.04 --> 1926.86]  but it also
[1926.86 --> 1928.18]  has everything
[1928.18 --> 1929.08]  to do with the mission
[1929.08 --> 1930.48]  that we're on.
[1931.44 --> 1932.08]  Right now,
[1932.18 --> 1932.88]  there are so many
[1932.88 --> 1934.02]  church growth strategies,
[1934.28 --> 1935.20]  there are so many strategies
[1935.20 --> 1936.18]  for how to grow a church,
[1936.26 --> 1936.98]  how to be on mission,
[1937.30 --> 1938.36]  more books written on that
[1938.36 --> 1939.14]  than I could ever read
[1939.14 --> 1939.82]  in my lifetime.
[1939.82 --> 1940.90]  And a lot of it
[1940.90 --> 1941.84]  has to do with marketing,
[1942.54 --> 1942.96]  promotion,
[1943.60 --> 1944.22]  social media,
[1944.66 --> 1945.12]  websites,
[1945.46 --> 1946.18]  and live streams.
[1946.28 --> 1947.28]  And I have no attack
[1947.28 --> 1948.46]  on any of those things.
[1948.94 --> 1949.84]  But I do wonder,
[1950.72 --> 1951.54]  what if
[1951.54 --> 1952.80]  the main thing
[1952.80 --> 1953.68]  we're called to do
[1953.68 --> 1956.00]  is be in real community
[1956.00 --> 1958.16]  and allow our shared life
[1958.16 --> 1959.60]  to bear witness
[1959.60 --> 1960.08]  to the kingdom?
[1961.48 --> 1962.64]  The early church,
[1963.24 --> 1964.28]  most of the questions
[1964.28 --> 1965.02]  asked of them
[1965.02 --> 1965.86]  for what they believe
[1965.86 --> 1967.44]  is seeing Christians
[1967.44 --> 1968.30]  live their life
[1968.30 --> 1968.74]  in community
[1968.74 --> 1969.52]  and then asking questions
[1969.52 --> 1969.66]  like,
[1969.82 --> 1970.44]  why do you do that?
[1970.50 --> 1971.00]  Why do you care
[1971.00 --> 1971.52]  for the poor?
[1971.74 --> 1972.54]  Why do you give money
[1972.54 --> 1973.18]  to these causes?
[1973.32 --> 1973.98]  Why are you sharing
[1973.98 --> 1974.42]  these meals?
[1974.54 --> 1975.18]  Why are you celebrating
[1975.18 --> 1975.54]  communion?
[1975.78 --> 1976.52]  And their answer
[1976.52 --> 1977.64]  was their evangelism.
[1978.08 --> 1979.36]  But their shared life
[1979.36 --> 1980.70]  was what caused
[1980.70 --> 1981.20]  the questions.
[1982.28 --> 1982.88]  Could it be
[1982.88 --> 1984.50]  that one of the best
[1984.50 --> 1985.80]  quote unquote strategies
[1985.80 --> 1987.40]  for mission right now
[1987.40 --> 1988.94]  is real community?
[1990.16 --> 1991.32]  Living as Christ
[1991.32 --> 1992.30]  calls us to live,
[1992.56 --> 1993.74]  as the body of Christ.
[1993.74 --> 1998.14]  I want to finish
[1998.14 --> 1998.96]  just by reading
[1998.96 --> 2000.14]  verse 27 again.
[2000.92 --> 2001.48]  After talking about
[2001.48 --> 2001.96]  the unity
[2001.96 --> 2002.84]  and the diversity,
[2003.12 --> 2003.62]  the gifts
[2003.62 --> 2004.56]  of the body,
[2004.64 --> 2005.40]  the spirit given
[2005.40 --> 2005.92]  to the body,
[2006.04 --> 2006.76]  Paul says,
[2007.14 --> 2008.00]  now you
[2008.00 --> 2009.32]  are the body
[2009.32 --> 2009.92]  of Christ
[2009.92 --> 2011.28]  and each
[2011.28 --> 2012.38]  one of you
[2012.38 --> 2013.70]  is part of it.
[2014.70 --> 2015.40]  Let's pray.
[2015.40 --> 2021.60]  Father,
[2021.68 --> 2022.26]  we pray that
[2022.26 --> 2023.10]  you would teach us
[2023.10 --> 2023.84]  what it means
[2023.84 --> 2024.62]  to be your body.
[2026.24 --> 2027.28]  And I feel the need
[2027.28 --> 2027.88]  to confess
[2027.88 --> 2028.94]  on behalf of our church
[2028.94 --> 2030.02]  the ways that we've made
[2030.02 --> 2031.62]  discipleship a solo affair,
[2032.30 --> 2033.56]  the way we've tried
[2033.56 --> 2034.62]  to individualize
[2034.62 --> 2035.64]  and privatize
[2035.64 --> 2036.26]  our faith
[2036.26 --> 2036.84]  in ways that
[2036.84 --> 2038.04]  not only cut us off
[2038.04 --> 2038.56]  from the life
[2038.56 --> 2039.10]  of the spirit,
[2039.76 --> 2041.22]  but cut the city off
[2041.22 --> 2042.58]  from seeing the life
[2042.58 --> 2043.12]  of the gospel
[2043.12 --> 2044.04]  lived in community.
[2044.04 --> 2046.12]  I pray that
[2046.12 --> 2046.74]  you would work
[2046.74 --> 2047.48]  in us now
[2047.48 --> 2048.20]  to give us
[2048.20 --> 2048.76]  a hunger
[2048.76 --> 2050.26]  for the church,
[2050.96 --> 2051.98]  a renewed commitment
[2051.98 --> 2052.92]  to the body
[2052.92 --> 2054.30]  for the sake
[2054.30 --> 2055.52]  of your world.
[2056.74 --> 2057.00]  Lord,
[2057.06 --> 2057.52]  I pray
[2057.52 --> 2058.42]  that you would
[2058.42 --> 2059.32]  give us patience
[2059.32 --> 2060.22]  in this season
[2060.22 --> 2060.84]  of isolation,
[2061.82 --> 2062.36]  creativity
[2062.36 --> 2063.16]  to reach out
[2063.16 --> 2064.04]  in the ways we can,
[2064.86 --> 2066.30]  and a deep desire
[2066.30 --> 2067.94]  to be your church
[2067.94 --> 2069.28]  for your city,
[2069.78 --> 2070.30]  for the sake
[2070.30 --> 2070.84]  of the world.
[2071.58 --> 2071.84]  Amen.
[2074.04 --> 2075.24]  Amen.
[2076.24 --> 2077.00]  Amen.
