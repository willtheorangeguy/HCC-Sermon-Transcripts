[0.00 → 13.04] Well, good morning, Hope.
[14.68 → 16.76] Thank you, Sid, for those kind words.
[17.50 → 19.84] I remember, you know, five and a half years ago,
[19.90 → 21.36] before this building was even finished,
[22.00 → 25.26] you and I'm grabbing what was for me then the first lunch at the Dublin,
[25.26 → 28.06] and you're just giving me a vision for the future of the church,
[28.06 → 32.36] for your own ministry as you were going to the next five years towards 65,
[33.22 → 37.62] and wanting to go at some point to a reduced role and slowly transition.
[37.76 → 41.38] We call this a slow-motion transition of the last five years, and it goes like that.
[42.38 → 45.50] And I just want to say I've learned so much from you.
[46.02 → 48.80] I had to learn way more than I thought I had to learn,
[49.14 → 51.68] and I'm so grateful for all that you've taught,
[51.68 → 54.24] the way you've just embodied faithful leadership,
[54.84 → 57.36] and I'm just grateful for the gift of your friendship as well.
[57.36 → 59.56] And I'm also grateful that it's not a goodbye.
[60.00 → 63.58] You know, after the sabbatical, you'll return, we pray, no more heart attacks,
[64.04 → 66.60] to a role at our church, a part-time role.
[67.04 → 69.94] And we've talked a fair bit about what we should call Sid,
[70.02 → 72.16] what his title should be upon his return,
[72.60 → 75.12] and we jokingly settled on resident grandfather.
[75.70 → 77.86] You know, when you're here after 25 years, that's what you become.
[78.04 → 81.34] Regardless of the title, Pastor Sid will be our resident grandfather.
[83.06 → 85.64] Well, it's a new year, and we're beginning a new sermon series.
[85.64 → 88.68] You can see on the poster here, it's called Apprenticing with Jesus.
[88.88 → 92.30] And in many ways, this is a Foundations of Discipleship series,
[92.66 → 97.76] and we're pretty excited just to unpack what it looks like to be people who follow Jesus.
[97.96 → 101.14] What does it look like on the ground during the day, in the week,
[101.20 → 103.66] to be apprentices of Jesus Christ?
[104.26 → 107.44] And we use that word, we actually stole it from Dallas Willard, a good writer,
[107.64 → 113.42] because we think apprentice captures a very significant piece of what discipleship is.
[113.42 → 116.48] And I know a number of you are actually apprenticing right now for various trades,
[116.56 → 120.24] and so you have in your mind a clear sense of what an apprenticeship is.
[120.46 → 125.16] This blend of learning, of studying, but also doing and practicing.
[125.82 → 129.70] You watch your teacher, who's a seasoned, often a seasoned person in the trade,
[129.98 → 133.62] do the cut on the meter saw, and then you yourself go up to that meter saw,
[133.70 → 134.54] and you make the cut.
[134.80 → 137.48] And the goal is not just to know, to understand,
[137.48 → 142.18] but also to practice and do the very trade you've signed up to do.
[143.12 → 144.80] And so it is with discipleship.
[145.14 → 148.02] We want to understand and know the teacher,
[148.38 → 151.84] and we want to listen to him and begin to do what our teacher does,
[151.90 → 152.52] and that is Jesus.
[153.80 → 156.52] And so we want to begin this series by reading together
[156.52 → 160.54] an invitation to apprenticeship from Jesus himself, from Mark's Gospel.
[160.62 → 161.82] And I invite you to grab your Bibles,
[161.98 → 163.78] that goes for our children and our youth as well.
[163.78 → 166.74] Grab your own Bibles and turn with me to Mark chapter 8.
[178.00 → 182.66] Then he called the crowd to him, along with his disciples, and said,
[183.52 → 187.12] whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves,
[187.72 → 190.34] take up their cross, and follow me.
[190.34 → 193.94] For whoever wants to save their lives will lose it.
[194.60 → 198.40] But whoever loses their lives for me and for the gospel will save it.
[199.14 → 203.50] What good is it for you to gain the whole world, yet forfeit your soul?
[204.32 → 206.70] Or what can you give in exchange for your soul?
[207.46 → 211.92] If any of you are ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation,
[212.42 → 214.52] the Son of Man will be ashamed of you
[214.52 → 218.48] when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels.
[218.48 → 229.58] I wonder if there's ever a time in your life
[229.58 → 233.62] where you've stopped, and you've simply asked,
[234.12 → 239.24] what in the world did I sign up for with this whole Christianity thing?
[240.16 → 244.86] What in the world am I in when I say I follow Jesus?
[244.86 → 251.92] I find that question comes at all sorts of milestones and crossroads in life.
[252.92 → 255.50] I know of many young adults who grew up in the church,
[255.96 → 259.52] they go off to university, and finally they're asking those deep questions,
[260.14 → 262.46] what did my parents pull me into?
[263.74 → 268.42] Or young parents who see little children running around their house that belong to them,
[268.42 → 273.28] who are watching them and what they do and say and how they live and say to themselves,
[273.80 → 278.64] what kind of life is my life teaching my own children?
[280.10 → 283.08] Or perhaps you're new to the Christian faith, you're new to our church,
[283.56 → 287.68] and you're thinking to yourself, what does it actually mean in my day-to-day life
[287.68 → 291.26] to be a follower, a disciple, an apprentice of Jesus?
[291.26 → 296.18] Or perhaps you're, like many people, in the post-2020 fog,
[296.66 → 299.48] and you look back on the previous year, and you're looking ahead to the year
[299.48 → 300.46] and you're thinking to yourself,
[300.94 → 306.48] at the end of the day, in my mundane, ordinary life of working at home and living at home,
[307.12 → 310.68] what does Jesus make to the mundane of my life?
[312.50 → 315.74] Whatever your circumstances, I think it's an excellent time.
[315.74 → 319.12] It's always a good time to ask those foundational questions,
[319.88 → 325.98] what does it mean for us, for my family, for me to follow Jesus?
[326.44 → 330.30] What does it mean to respond to that invitation from Jesus himself,
[330.80 → 332.68] come, follow me?
[334.30 → 337.38] I would have loved to be a fly on the wall for this passage,
[337.94 → 339.84] for the event that Mark is describing,
[339.96 → 345.14] where Jesus invites the crowds close to listen in to what he's going to say,
[345.14 → 347.40] disciples mixed in that bunch,
[347.68 → 350.44] and then to make that wide-open invitation,
[350.80 → 354.80] whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves,
[355.68 → 358.00] take up the cross, and follow me.
[359.58 → 363.36] I imagine the faces of the crowds wondering what he's trying to say,
[363.70 → 367.96] people who are intrigued by him, curious what it means to actually do that
[367.96 → 371.06] with this man who's been going around healing, casting out demons,
[371.38 → 373.36] feeding the sick, feeding the hungry.
[373.36 → 377.66] What does it mean to be a disciple of this particular rabbi?
[378.22 → 383.76] And I also imagine people hearing this demanding invitation of self-denial
[383.76 → 386.50] and suffering and saying, no, thanks.
[387.96 → 392.12] And these people, of course, getting at how Dietrich Bonhoeffer summarizes this passage
[392.12 → 395.50] when he says, when Christ calls a man or woman,
[396.16 → 398.72] he calls them to come and to die.
[398.72 → 403.82] Now, although there were many different perspectives on Jesus,
[404.94 → 408.68] and many people had different takes on his identity and what he was about,
[408.92 → 413.82] they had a fairly shared and clear sense of what he was doing at this time in his ministry.
[414.90 → 417.94] Jesus was, to the crowd, a rabbi.
[418.60 → 423.92] He was, to his own disciples, a teacher of the law, a teacher of the scriptures.
[423.92 → 428.44] In fact, if you look, if you read the Gospels, when they approach Jesus, and they address Jesus,
[428.54 → 430.86] they call him rabbi.
[431.78 → 438.68] And Jesus seems to embrace this understanding, and he embraces this rabbi-disciple system,
[439.16 → 442.48] and he uses it to teach people about who he really is,
[442.72 → 444.58] what the kingdom of God is all about,
[444.66 → 448.84] and what it means to be a disciple and a citizen and a follower of Jesus.
[448.84 → 454.00] And I'm going to spend some time this morning actually looking at this thing of discipleship,
[454.06 → 456.56] how they would have seen rabbis and disciples,
[456.82 → 460.04] and why that teaches us so much about what we are invited into
[460.04 → 463.46] when we respond to Jesus' call today to follow him.
[464.76 → 468.28] And one of the first things I want you to know about discipleship and this situation
[468.28 → 471.80] is that when Jesus says, come and follow me, he's speaking in that system
[471.80 → 474.18] where people understand rabbis, they understand disciples.
[474.42 → 475.72] It's actually a common thing.
[475.72 → 479.16] Again, Jesus wasn't the first rabbi to be walking around with disciples.
[479.72 → 483.80] Even though it's strange for us, there were many rabbis and groups of disciples before Jesus,
[483.98 → 488.18] and many that came after Jesus and had disciples who would follow them,
[488.66 → 493.60] listen to their teaching, watch their way of life, and want to become like that rabbi.
[494.08 → 495.02] That was a common thing.
[495.72 → 497.96] But Jesus takes this institution, you might say,
[498.20 → 501.64] and he moulds it and shifts it and forms it for his purposes
[501.64 → 507.54] because he is not just a rabbi, and his disciples are being pulled into something much bigger
[507.54 → 510.22] than just an apprenticeship to become a teacher of the law.
[512.04 → 516.88] First, for example, in the first century, the way it worked is that a student,
[517.04 → 521.50] a bright, very advanced student, would become an apprentice to a particular rabbi.
[521.88 → 524.16] And the process leading up to that, by the way, for boys,
[524.48 → 527.10] was that they would first master the Old Testament scriptures,
[527.10 → 531.54] they would memorize Genesis to Deuteronomy, and just to give you a sense of what that is,
[531.98 → 535.34] that's this portion of the Bible memorized.
[536.24 → 541.10] Then after some more scrupulous examination and some testing from the rabbis,
[541.22 → 544.88] they would move on to become eligible to be a disciple,
[545.18 → 548.36] and then they would often pick their particular rabbi,
[548.46 → 551.50] kind of like a doctoral student picks their supervisor.
[552.32 → 554.62] And they would want to go with a rabbi in a certain school
[554.62 → 557.48] and want to sort of study under them and follow that school of thought.
[558.36 → 561.12] Then Jesus comes, and this invitation from Mark chapter 8,
[561.30 → 563.30] he flips that whole system, really, on its head.
[563.94 → 565.32] His invitation isn't to the elite.
[565.40 → 568.24] He says, whoever wants to be my disciple.
[569.26 → 570.34] That's a game changer.
[570.78 → 571.52] Not academic?
[572.32 → 573.32] You can be a disciple.
[574.30 → 574.70] Poor?
[575.34 → 576.26] You can be an apprentice.
[576.76 → 579.06] Not from noble birth or from a favoured ethnicity.
[579.48 → 582.36] You can be part of Jesus' apprenticeship.
[582.36 → 587.94] From a disreputable background or vocation, say, like a tax collector.
[588.80 → 590.42] You can be a disciple.
[591.54 → 594.14] In the school of Jesus, everything is turned upside down,
[594.20 → 598.28] and the prerequisite is no longer GPA or background or finances.
[598.64 → 601.78] It's giving up everything, denying oneself,
[602.68 → 606.10] and following this rabbi, this Jesus.
[606.10 → 612.04] But secondly, rabbis in the first century would never say what Jesus said.
[612.86 → 616.86] Rabbis in the first century were students and masters of the Scriptures.
[617.36 → 618.64] And they would say to the students,
[619.02 → 621.92] come follow me as I study and teach the Scriptures.
[622.06 → 623.54] Become a master of the Torah.
[624.10 → 625.04] What does Jesus say?
[625.90 → 627.42] Follow me.
[627.42 → 632.24] These would be blasphemous words for people in the first century,
[632.32 → 633.54] for Jews who knew the Scriptures.
[633.78 → 635.66] Who says these kinds of things?
[635.92 → 639.48] What you say is, let's master the Scriptures.
[640.50 → 643.32] And of course, what they didn't know yet and what Jesus would teach himself
[643.32 → 645.58] is that he is the fulfillment of the Torah.
[646.10 → 647.54] He's the fulfillment of the prophets.
[647.68 → 649.72] He's the fulfillment of the wisdom literature.
[649.72 → 653.46] All of it culminates in him as a person,
[653.80 → 656.24] coming and doing what the whole Scriptures are about.
[657.22 → 658.68] He is the fulfillment of the law.
[658.80 → 663.40] And so, what this means is any person who'd become an apprentice to Jesus
[663.40 → 668.28] now centres the whole of their life around this person, Jesus.
[668.82 → 672.22] He becomes the governing authority that makes sense of the whole of life.
[674.04 → 675.86] When I was in university, I had a friend,
[676.02 → 678.56] and she often had quotes on the front of her binders.
[678.56 → 681.40] Back before everyone had laptops in class.
[682.24 → 684.52] And on one of her binders, she had this quote,
[684.66 → 686.82] and this is my paraphrase because I can't remember it exactly,
[687.02 → 687.96] but it was something like,
[688.48 → 692.26] live in such a way that people ask questions about your life,
[692.92 → 696.34] the answer to which is always Jesus.
[697.74 → 699.44] What's behind that quote is this sense that
[699.44 → 702.74] your coherence in life is Jesus.
[703.24 → 705.36] What makes sense of the way you live with your friends,
[705.52 → 706.78] the way you spend your time and leisure,
[706.78 → 709.50] the way you spend your money, the way you do all of your life,
[709.86 → 711.32] brings coherence in Jesus.
[712.00 → 714.84] And if that is pulled out, the whole of life collapses.
[715.58 → 717.02] The meaning and purpose that give,
[717.14 → 718.70] that animates what you do from day to day,
[718.90 → 722.66] collapses because it's all about Jesus.
[723.80 → 728.34] Apprenticeship is about Him and becoming like that rabbi.
[729.30 → 733.38] Thirdly, the relationship between a rabbi and a disciple was very established.
[733.38 → 737.46] In some sense, when disciples came under the tutelage of a certain rabbi,
[737.66 → 739.90] they would want to, they see them as a means to an end,
[739.94 → 742.78] and their goal was to become that rabbi, right?
[742.84 → 743.78] That's why they would pick them.
[744.48 → 747.12] And so they were just a short program a few years,
[747.18 → 749.80] and after that, when they sort of mastered what they need to master,
[749.88 → 750.76] they become the rabbi.
[751.78 → 753.62] Things change a little bit in the school of Jesus.
[753.76 → 756.04] First, Jesus wasn't just teaching them
[756.04 → 758.06] to make them students of the scriptures.
[758.62 → 759.64] Critical though that was.
[759.64 → 762.88] Jesus had come to establish the kingdom of God.
[763.20 → 764.92] He came to break the power of sin.
[765.02 → 767.84] He came to bring the renewal of God to the whole of His creation.
[768.48 → 771.28] And so He's inviting His disciples into something much bigger.
[772.20 → 776.24] But that also means that this isn't just like a three-year program
[776.24 → 780.32] where they sort of master the program, and they become Jesus.
[781.02 → 781.86] He's God.
[782.90 → 785.10] For them, this program becomes lifelong.
[785.10 → 789.64] It becomes the rest of their life until Jesus comes in glory and power.
[789.96 → 792.68] And their goal is to become like Him,
[793.16 → 794.62] to reflect His character,
[794.76 → 797.88] to live as citizens in this kingdom He's establishing.
[799.26 → 802.84] And remember, the word Christian just simply means little Christ.
[803.50 → 805.94] Their goal was to become little Christs.
[805.94 → 811.46] But this also flips the relationship between the rabbi and the student.
[811.56 → 813.58] Not only do they see Jesus differently than rabbis,
[813.84 → 817.02] Jesus sees His apprentices different from most rabbis.
[817.54 → 823.34] This is the Jesus who sees His disciples as co-heirs of the kingdom,
[824.04 → 827.04] who will inherit the earth when Jesus returns.
[827.80 → 829.60] Jesus calls them in the Gospel of John,
[829.60 → 836.52] who He will then go and lay His life down for.
[837.52 → 839.88] Jesus fills them with the Spirit
[839.88 → 843.32] so that they can actually do the things that He's doing.
[844.00 → 846.44] This is the same Jesus who at the end of Matthew's Gospel says,
[846.70 → 848.04] Surely I am with you.
[848.24 → 850.30] I will walk with you and be present to you,
[850.54 → 852.72] even to the end of the age.
[853.52 → 856.80] Jesus sees His apprentices very different
[856.80 → 858.76] than most rabbis see students.
[860.42 → 861.04] But finally,
[862.54 → 864.26] understanding first century apprenticeship,
[864.72 → 867.08] perhaps the most critical piece was time.
[868.50 → 870.92] Anyone who would come under the tool age of a rabbi
[870.92 → 873.70] would know that this is giving up what you thought you wanted to do,
[874.06 → 877.56] sacrificing your time so you can be with them.
[878.76 → 880.00] Time was critical.
[880.60 → 882.16] Being with the rabbi.
[882.22 → 884.72] And I want to read for you a quote from one author
[884.72 → 887.60] about what it looked like to become an apprentice.
[888.78 → 889.28] He writes,
[889.50 → 891.98] It means that the disciple walk with Him,
[892.38 → 893.64] eat and drink with Him,
[893.80 → 894.90] listen to what He says,
[895.04 → 896.08] and see what He does.
[896.48 → 899.06] They are invited with Him into houses and hovels
[899.06 → 900.82] or are turned away with Him.
[901.26 → 902.90] They are not called to great achievements,
[903.06 → 903.94] religious or otherwise.
[904.30 → 906.32] They are invited as companions to share
[906.32 → 908.06] in what takes place around Jesus.
[908.68 → 911.08] They are therefore called not to attach
[911.08 → 912.56] much importance to themselves.
[913.06 → 914.14] Oh man, that's good news.
[914.14 → 916.58] And what they accomplish or faith to accomplish,
[916.86 → 918.52] but to attach great importance
[918.52 → 922.28] to what takes place through Jesus and with Him.
[923.46 → 924.74] In fact, there is this phrase,
[925.00 → 927.62] almost like a blessing to an apprentice or a disciple.
[927.74 → 928.02] They would say,
[928.10 → 930.88] May you be covered in the dust of your rabbi.
[931.76 → 933.40] That phrase basically gives the image
[933.40 → 936.04] of walking so closely behind your rabbi
[936.04 → 938.06] that the dust that comes off his sandals
[938.06 → 939.28] attaches to your clothes.
[939.34 → 940.20] And that's a good thing
[940.20 → 941.84] because you're so close to him.
[941.84 → 946.42] I think a translation for a British Columbian context would be,
[946.84 → 950.34] May you be soaked with the rain from His rain boots.
[951.74 → 953.00] Discipleship for us today.
[954.20 → 955.38] But don't miss this then.
[956.52 → 958.24] Discipleship and apprenticeship with Jesus
[958.24 → 961.80] is responding to that invitation that He makes,
[962.10 → 963.66] the call He invites us into,
[963.82 → 964.66] to follow Him,
[964.66 → 966.10] to give up all things,
[966.44 → 969.08] to be willing to suffer for Him.
[969.88 → 971.64] And this program,
[972.12 → 972.76] Lifelong,
[973.02 → 975.66] is entering the whole of life
[975.66 → 977.32] around a person,
[978.38 → 979.08] Jesus Christ,
[979.68 → 981.58] who is the fulfillment of the Scriptures.
[982.26 → 984.56] It is pouring your time
[984.56 → 985.86] into watching,
[986.30 → 986.78] observing,
[987.04 → 988.48] and patterning your life
[988.48 → 989.78] after His.
[989.78 → 992.28] and recognizing that it's more
[992.28 → 994.32] than just becoming a rabbi.
[994.98 → 996.52] It's becoming a little Christ,
[997.56 → 999.18] bearing witness to His identity,
[999.50 → 1000.10] His power,
[1000.24 → 1000.86] His glory,
[1001.12 → 1002.06] and His grace.
[1003.52 → 1004.62] That's what it means
[1004.62 → 1005.42] to sign up
[1005.42 → 1006.88] in the school of Jesus.
[1006.88 → 1009.24] That's what it means
[1009.24 → 1010.66] for us to respond,
[1011.40 → 1012.22] to follow Me.
[1013.36 → 1014.48] And I'm sure there's some of us
[1014.48 → 1015.02] who even now,
[1015.08 → 1015.48] as you're listening,
[1015.58 → 1015.94] you're thinking,
[1016.10 → 1016.70] okay, Dave,
[1017.46 → 1018.60] it was a little easier for them.
[1019.36 → 1020.70] They got to see Jesus.
[1021.46 → 1022.34] They heard Him.
[1022.56 → 1023.56] He taught with them.
[1023.64 → 1024.44] He ate with them.
[1024.58 → 1025.38] He would rebuke them
[1025.38 → 1026.12] when they didn't get it,
[1026.16 → 1027.42] like He was physically present.
[1027.70 → 1029.28] It's a little different for us now.
[1030.36 → 1031.82] Perhaps sometimes you've even felt jealous
[1031.82 → 1032.38] of the disciples.
[1032.48 → 1034.34] They got to be with Jesus.
[1034.76 → 1035.88] But now He's with the Father.
[1035.88 → 1037.22] And we have the Spirit,
[1037.32 → 1038.42] which Jesus says is better.
[1038.52 → 1039.56] We live in this weird,
[1039.76 → 1040.94] wild west coast
[1040.94 → 1042.60] in a very different context.
[1042.98 → 1044.04] What does this kind of apprenticeship
[1044.04 → 1045.84] look like for us now?
[1046.92 → 1048.42] And that really is the question
[1048.42 → 1049.48] that we are going to unpack
[1049.48 → 1050.90] for the rest of this series.
[1051.86 → 1052.74] Being with Jesus.
[1053.90 → 1055.36] Becoming like Jesus.
[1056.26 → 1058.34] Doing what Jesus did.
[1059.82 → 1061.22] You're going to hear us hammering
[1061.22 → 1061.78] at the beginning
[1061.78 → 1064.82] on the importance of being with Jesus.
[1065.88 → 1067.60] That central to apprenticeship
[1067.60 → 1069.36] is being in the presence
[1069.36 → 1070.62] of the teacher.
[1071.54 → 1072.72] Learning from Him.
[1073.30 → 1074.24] Listening to Him.
[1074.66 → 1075.80] And just practicing
[1075.80 → 1076.92] being in the presence
[1076.92 → 1078.40] of our loving Saviour.
[1080.30 → 1081.52] You know, one thing I will say
[1081.52 → 1083.10] over the last five years
[1083.10 → 1084.50] as I've come to this church
[1084.50 → 1085.14] and gotten to know
[1085.14 → 1085.86] our congregation,
[1086.72 → 1087.82] God has placed in me
[1087.82 → 1090.04] a deeper and deeper desire
[1090.04 → 1091.84] for us as a community,
[1092.42 → 1093.42] for you as families
[1093.42 → 1094.78] and couples and individuals
[1094.78 → 1096.74] to be deep believers.
[1097.94 → 1098.72] And I don't want us
[1098.72 → 1099.58] to play church.
[1099.98 → 1101.56] I want us to be the church.
[1102.02 → 1103.04] And I have a deep desire
[1103.04 → 1104.34] for us together
[1104.34 → 1106.60] to learn how to be
[1106.60 → 1107.88] and practice
[1107.88 → 1109.42] the presence of Christ.
[1110.40 → 1111.36] And if you know me,
[1111.42 → 1112.06] some of you will know
[1112.06 → 1113.24] that I'm on a bit of a journey
[1113.24 → 1113.86] even myself
[1113.86 → 1114.32] to look at
[1114.32 → 1116.06] what does meaningful discipleship
[1116.06 → 1116.44] look like
[1116.44 → 1117.14] in this weird
[1117.14 → 1118.46] postmodern world of BC?
[1119.30 → 1120.26] What are the practices
[1120.26 → 1121.60] and the habits
[1121.60 → 1122.64] that we need to adopt
[1122.64 → 1123.82] such that we are living
[1123.82 → 1125.82] in a life-giving relationship
[1125.82 → 1126.90] with Jesus?
[1128.02 → 1128.84] And the disciples,
[1129.06 → 1129.62] the first thing
[1129.62 → 1130.42] they needed to do
[1130.42 → 1131.48] with Jesus
[1131.48 → 1132.70] is learned how to be with Him,
[1132.82 → 1133.48] to watch Him,
[1133.56 → 1134.28] to listen to Him,
[1134.46 → 1135.14] to find out
[1135.14 → 1136.12] how He responds
[1136.12 → 1136.60] to the outsiders,
[1136.70 → 1137.28] how He cares
[1137.28 → 1137.98] for the lowest,
[1138.12 → 1138.82] the least, and the lost,
[1138.86 → 1139.40] and then to begin
[1139.40 → 1140.12] doing those things.
[1140.12 → 1141.12] But it all starts
[1141.12 → 1142.20] with time.
[1144.00 → 1144.48] Presence.
[1145.22 → 1145.74] Next week,
[1145.80 → 1146.44] Sid's going to preach
[1146.44 → 1147.20] on John 15
[1147.20 → 1148.00] where Jesus makes
[1148.00 → 1149.08] those beautiful words,
[1149.08 → 1150.46] I am the vine,
[1151.36 → 1152.34] you are the branches.
[1153.26 → 1154.00] Apart from me,
[1154.06 → 1155.28] you can do nothing.
[1156.44 → 1156.88] Abide,
[1157.10 → 1157.80] remain in me,
[1157.86 → 1158.50] and you will bear
[1158.50 → 1159.98] much fruit.
[1160.90 → 1161.74] Out of that time,
[1161.82 → 1162.46] out of that presence
[1162.46 → 1164.28] comes a change
[1164.28 → 1164.78] in character,
[1165.42 → 1166.46] a change in desire,
[1166.80 → 1168.30] a change in content,
[1168.54 → 1169.92] or a change in conduct,
[1170.86 → 1172.12] starting with presence.
[1173.12 → 1173.48] But,
[1173.88 → 1174.82] as we see
[1174.82 → 1175.96] even in the disciples
[1175.96 → 1176.68] in the book of Acts,
[1176.74 → 1177.84] as they are in Christ,
[1177.92 → 1178.60] as they spend time
[1178.60 → 1178.90] with Christ,
[1179.02 → 1179.68] what happens is
[1179.68 → 1180.70] they begin to desire
[1180.70 → 1181.54] what Christ desires.
[1181.62 → 1182.10] They begin to do
[1182.10 → 1183.10] what Jesus does.
[1183.42 → 1184.28] They begin to practice
[1184.28 → 1185.00] generosity.
[1185.48 → 1186.28] They begin to pray
[1186.28 → 1186.86] for healing.
[1187.14 → 1188.46] They begin to show people
[1188.46 → 1189.92] what it is to follow Jesus.
[1190.02 → 1190.84] They begin to share
[1190.84 → 1191.66] the good news.
[1192.54 → 1193.72] They exercise justice.
[1193.88 → 1194.92] They care for the poor.
[1195.16 → 1196.08] They give of themselves.
[1196.28 → 1196.80] They break bread
[1196.80 → 1197.42] with strangers
[1197.42 → 1198.26] and friends
[1198.26 → 1199.74] and enemies.
[1200.68 → 1201.32] They forgive.
[1202.34 → 1203.10] All of this
[1203.10 → 1204.10] is just the aroma
[1204.10 → 1204.74] of Christ
[1204.74 → 1206.18] filling and living
[1206.18 → 1207.00] through the Spirit
[1207.00 → 1207.72] in the life
[1207.72 → 1208.26] of disciples.
[1209.80 → 1210.52] And I pray
[1210.52 → 1211.74] that in this series,
[1211.88 → 1212.76] even as we walk
[1212.76 → 1213.52] through these different
[1213.52 → 1214.88] dimensions of discipleship,
[1215.28 → 1215.96] these habits
[1215.96 → 1217.14] and practices of faith,
[1217.48 → 1218.56] coming out of listening
[1218.56 → 1219.10] and living
[1219.10 → 1219.90] in the presence of Christ,
[1220.10 → 1221.22] that you have a hunger
[1221.22 → 1223.12] for this kind of life.
[1223.80 → 1225.26] Because it is life.
[1226.40 → 1227.38] Walking with Christ,
[1227.94 → 1229.10] living as He lived,
[1229.36 → 1230.14] is life.
[1230.94 → 1231.10] I mean,
[1231.16 → 1231.64] think about that.
[1231.64 → 1232.10] Who doesn't want
[1232.10 → 1232.90] to live generously,
[1233.56 → 1234.08] justly,
[1234.26 → 1234.94] at peace,
[1235.30 → 1236.10] forgiving friends,
[1236.24 → 1237.04] forgiving enemies,
[1237.58 → 1238.40] breaking bread
[1238.40 → 1240.04] with people around you,
[1240.38 → 1241.10] being light
[1241.10 → 1241.86] in the city?
[1246.94 → 1248.24] I can't introduce
[1248.24 → 1249.62] a series on discipleship
[1249.62 → 1251.44] of also naming
[1251.44 → 1252.20] a reality
[1252.20 → 1253.52] facing so many churches,
[1254.08 → 1254.76] ours included.
[1255.56 → 1256.28] And that is that
[1256.28 → 1256.90] in the West,
[1257.50 → 1258.70] there is not just
[1258.70 → 1259.84] a discipleship problem,
[1259.84 → 1262.26] there's a discipleship crisis.
[1264.30 → 1265.74] I've talked to enough people
[1265.74 → 1266.50] and I've lived enough
[1266.50 → 1267.20] of my own life
[1267.20 → 1267.86] to realize that
[1267.86 → 1268.60] a lot of people
[1268.60 → 1270.24] feel like they're not
[1270.24 → 1271.26] spending time with Christ.
[1271.98 → 1272.98] They're not becoming
[1272.98 → 1274.06] more like Him.
[1274.70 → 1275.78] They're not practicing
[1275.78 → 1276.76] what He practiced
[1276.76 → 1277.78] and doing the kinds
[1277.78 → 1278.56] of things He did.
[1278.64 → 1279.28] So much so that
[1279.28 → 1279.90] a lot of people say,
[1280.20 → 1281.62] I must be missing something
[1281.62 → 1283.94] because this is not going well.
[1284.46 → 1285.44] There are all sorts of questions
[1285.44 → 1286.64] about what in the world
[1286.64 → 1288.18] do I need to change?
[1288.18 → 1289.84] In the church,
[1290.12 → 1291.78] there is a discipleship crisis
[1291.78 → 1293.38] and we want to speak
[1293.38 → 1294.12] into that
[1294.12 → 1296.08] and learn together.
[1296.54 → 1297.40] I really do think
[1297.40 → 1297.82] as a church,
[1297.92 → 1298.46] this is a season
[1298.46 → 1299.00] for us to say,
[1299.10 → 1299.44] you know what?
[1299.62 → 1300.90] This isn't going well.
[1301.06 → 1301.94] This isn't going well
[1301.94 → 1302.54] in my life,
[1302.66 → 1303.30] in my marriage,
[1303.36 → 1303.98] in my family,
[1304.10 → 1305.00] and this isn't going well
[1305.00 → 1305.78] for us collectively
[1305.78 → 1307.08] and we can change.
[1307.66 → 1308.90] We can start new habits.
[1309.38 → 1310.04] We can listen
[1310.04 → 1310.66] and learn
[1310.66 → 1311.66] and slow down
[1311.66 → 1312.78] and again,
[1313.10 → 1314.18] learn new habits together.
[1314.18 → 1317.70] I've been reading
[1317.70 → 1318.96] a fair bit of Dallas Willard
[1318.96 → 1319.98] for this series
[1319.98 → 1321.42] and Dallas Willard,
[1321.48 → 1322.24] if you haven't read him,
[1322.32 → 1323.16] you should really pick up
[1323.16 → 1323.60] his book,
[1324.08 → 1325.10] Renovation of the Heart,
[1325.44 → 1326.32] but I want to read a quote
[1326.32 → 1327.20] that comes from his book,
[1327.28 → 1327.96] The Great Omission,
[1328.06 → 1328.62] which is really
[1328.62 → 1329.78] a whole book
[1329.78 → 1330.78] that talks about
[1330.78 → 1331.62] how we need to recover
[1331.62 → 1332.78] discipleship in the church
[1332.78 → 1333.78] and this is what he writes,
[1334.10 → 1335.04] very big statement.
[1335.44 → 1336.46] The greatest issue
[1336.46 → 1337.70] facing the world today,
[1338.10 → 1338.82] okay, here we go,
[1338.88 → 1339.52] what's he going to say?
[1339.52 → 1341.30] With all its heartbreaking needs
[1341.30 → 1342.56] is whether those who,
[1342.70 → 1343.90] by profession or culture,
[1344.14 → 1345.54] are identified as Christians
[1345.54 → 1347.30] will become disciples,
[1348.34 → 1348.98] students,
[1349.66 → 1350.06] apprentices,
[1350.84 → 1351.48] practitioners
[1351.48 → 1353.20] of Jesus Christ,
[1353.96 → 1355.44] steadily learning from him
[1355.44 → 1356.88] how to live the life
[1356.88 → 1358.00] of the kingdom of heaven
[1358.00 → 1359.58] in every corner
[1359.58 → 1360.72] of human existence.
[1362.74 → 1363.72] And of course,
[1363.78 → 1364.78] he's speaking specifically
[1364.78 → 1366.16] into an American context
[1366.16 → 1367.34] and this is true in Canada
[1367.34 → 1368.06] in its own ways,
[1368.42 → 1369.66] where there's this cultural notion
[1369.66 → 1370.36] of being a Christian
[1370.36 → 1371.36] that has no teeth,
[1372.28 → 1373.20] no commitment,
[1374.04 → 1375.96] no habits and daily patterns.
[1376.32 → 1377.34] And what he's basically saying
[1377.34 → 1378.44] is those who call themselves
[1378.44 → 1379.64] Christians need to become
[1379.64 → 1380.78] apprentices,
[1382.06 → 1382.54] disciples,
[1383.50 → 1384.86] patterning the lives
[1384.86 → 1385.56] after Jesus,
[1386.04 → 1387.10] being with him,
[1387.52 → 1388.30] learning from him
[1388.30 → 1390.12] and slowly walking
[1390.12 → 1391.36] in his ways.
[1394.40 → 1395.54] There are many people
[1395.54 → 1396.36] in this passage,
[1396.42 → 1396.60] in fact,
[1396.64 → 1397.24] there are two categories
[1397.24 → 1398.02] of people in this passage
[1398.02 → 1398.54] other than Jesus.
[1398.70 → 1399.52] There are disciples
[1399.52 → 1401.06] and then there's the crowd.
[1401.44 → 1402.08] And in that crowd,
[1402.16 → 1403.34] we can be safe to assume
[1403.34 → 1405.40] that many heard this call,
[1405.50 → 1406.46] this demanding call
[1406.46 → 1407.04] to come
[1407.04 → 1408.40] and to deny oneself
[1408.40 → 1409.54] and to take up one's cross,
[1409.62 → 1410.28] which is an invitation
[1410.28 → 1410.92] to suffer,
[1411.28 → 1412.08] make no mistake.
[1412.32 → 1412.80] And they say,
[1412.98 → 1414.06] no, thank you.
[1414.62 → 1415.42] No, thank you.
[1415.90 → 1416.70] I'm not interested
[1416.70 → 1417.62] in the cost,
[1417.86 → 1418.62] I'm not interested
[1418.62 → 1419.46] in the demands,
[1419.58 → 1420.30] and I don't even know
[1420.30 → 1420.88] what it means
[1420.88 → 1421.76] to be your disciple.
[1422.26 → 1423.68] I'll do it myself.
[1423.68 → 1424.62] Thank you very much.
[1424.62 → 1427.22] Willard,
[1427.28 → 1427.94] in one of his books,
[1428.00 → 1428.92] has a great discussion
[1428.92 → 1430.12] on what he calls
[1430.12 → 1432.06] the cost of non-discipleship.
[1432.76 → 1433.58] I think it's fair to say
[1433.58 → 1434.32] when we read a passage
[1434.32 → 1434.72] like this,
[1434.76 → 1434.96] we think,
[1435.06 → 1435.22] wow,
[1435.40 → 1436.54] that's a big ask,
[1436.70 → 1436.96] Jesus.
[1438.38 → 1439.14] Deny yourself.
[1439.56 → 1440.40] Take up your cross.
[1440.62 → 1441.84] Can I even do these things?
[1441.90 → 1442.64] Do I have it within me
[1442.64 → 1443.30] to do these things
[1443.30 → 1444.20] and give up everything
[1444.20 → 1445.44] to follow Jesus?
[1445.80 → 1446.56] But Willard would say,
[1446.64 → 1447.22] have you thought about
[1447.22 → 1449.30] the cost of non-discipleship?
[1449.90 → 1450.80] Have you thought about
[1450.80 → 1451.28] what it means
[1451.28 → 1452.72] to completely walk away
[1452.72 → 1453.32] from that
[1453.32 → 1455.70] and decide for yourself
[1455.70 → 1456.90] how to live
[1456.90 → 1457.92] the rest of your life?
[1458.78 → 1459.44] Have you thought
[1459.44 → 1460.40] what it's like
[1460.40 → 1462.22] to be completely
[1462.22 → 1463.58] at the power
[1463.58 → 1465.04] of your selfish desires
[1465.04 → 1466.78] for the whole of your life?
[1467.68 → 1468.72] What it must be like
[1468.72 → 1469.44] to be completely
[1469.44 → 1470.16] at the mercy
[1470.16 → 1471.88] of your impulses
[1471.88 → 1473.34] that control you
[1473.34 → 1474.18] over which you have
[1474.18 → 1475.30] no power of your own
[1475.30 → 1475.86] to control?
[1476.98 → 1477.62] Have you thought
[1477.62 → 1478.92] what kind of life it is
[1478.92 → 1479.96] to live the rest
[1479.96 → 1480.90] of your years
[1480.90 → 1483.46] as a re-entered person?
[1484.58 → 1486.00] A selfish person?
[1486.78 → 1488.20] Because that's the cost
[1488.20 → 1490.52] of the undisciplined life.
[1492.38 → 1493.38] And I could give you
[1493.38 → 1494.74] so many examples
[1494.74 → 1496.28] right now
[1496.28 → 1497.12] in our own city
[1497.12 → 1498.62] of the cost
[1498.62 → 1499.84] of discipleship.
[1500.86 → 1501.86] And what's so interesting
[1501.86 → 1502.46] to me
[1502.46 → 1504.06] about Western society
[1504.06 → 1505.04] as I see it right now,
[1505.08 → 1505.64] and you can disagree
[1505.64 → 1506.34] with me, that's fine,
[1506.38 → 1507.52] but I see Western society
[1507.52 → 1507.86] right now
[1507.86 → 1508.62] having this very
[1508.62 → 1510.06] beautiful veneer.
[1510.06 → 1512.56] It looks so good.
[1513.00 → 1513.62] I mean, Vancouver
[1513.62 → 1514.40] in a postcard
[1514.40 → 1515.24] is the best place
[1515.24 → 1515.88] on earth.
[1516.26 → 1516.70] But yet,
[1516.78 → 1518.06] as I look at people's lives,
[1518.12 → 1518.78] as I look at what's
[1518.78 → 1519.54] happening in our city,
[1519.64 → 1520.44] in Western society
[1520.44 → 1520.88] as a whole,
[1521.00 → 1522.46] I see this very thin,
[1522.58 → 1523.24] beautiful veneer,
[1523.28 → 1524.00] and underneath it
[1524.00 → 1525.56] is so much pain,
[1526.82 → 1528.10] so much loneliness,
[1528.98 → 1530.32] so much anxiety,
[1530.32 → 1532.84] and lost souls.
[1535.50 → 1536.54] That's the cost
[1536.54 → 1538.56] of discipleship.
[1538.60 → 1539.34] And make no mistake,
[1539.44 → 1540.46] discipleship is simply
[1540.46 → 1541.68] chasing after something else
[1541.68 → 1543.14] that can't give you life.
[1543.44 → 1544.10] It's forming
[1544.10 → 1544.96] and patterning your life
[1544.96 → 1545.36] after something
[1545.36 → 1547.02] that will not feed your soul
[1547.02 → 1548.46] and leave you empty
[1548.46 → 1550.06] because there's a God-shaped
[1550.06 → 1551.04] hole in your life
[1551.04 → 1552.70] that only Jesus can fill
[1552.70 → 1553.86] with God's life.
[1553.86 → 1556.70] You know,
[1556.72 → 1558.58] I know of a university chaplain
[1558.58 → 1559.46] in the States,
[1560.24 → 1561.44] very gifted evangelist,
[1561.60 → 1562.76] very good at building relationships,
[1563.20 → 1564.22] and his strategy,
[1564.40 → 1565.00] you might say,
[1565.08 → 1566.18] is just having conversations
[1566.18 → 1567.16] where he asks students
[1567.16 → 1568.46] studying a variety of things.
[1568.52 → 1568.80] He says,
[1569.00 → 1569.98] what are you pursuing?
[1570.52 → 1570.70] Like,
[1570.74 → 1571.26] what's the thing
[1571.26 → 1572.18] that's animating
[1572.18 → 1573.20] all that you're going
[1573.20 → 1574.24] to do with your life?
[1575.02 → 1575.76] And then they'll share
[1575.76 → 1576.54] what they're studying,
[1576.62 → 1577.18] what they want to be,
[1577.28 → 1577.98] what they want to do,
[1578.14 → 1579.46] and then he'll say,
[1579.84 → 1580.92] how's it going for you
[1580.92 → 1582.68] with that at the centre?
[1583.86 → 1584.96] And eventually,
[1585.18 → 1586.16] that often leads
[1586.16 → 1587.00] to a conversation
[1587.00 → 1589.30] where someone is chasing
[1589.30 → 1590.76] after gaining the whole world
[1590.76 → 1593.40] and forfeiting their soul.
[1594.96 → 1596.26] In comes the good news
[1596.26 → 1597.64] of Jesus Christ.
[1599.48 → 1601.06] And for us here
[1601.06 → 1602.68] in the veneer world
[1602.68 → 1603.86] of secular Vancouver,
[1604.86 → 1606.04] the call goes out.
[1607.46 → 1608.42] Follow me.
[1609.44 → 1610.16] Jesus says
[1610.16 → 1611.84] in the widest possible invitation,
[1612.18 → 1613.78] whoever wants to be
[1613.78 → 1614.38] my disciple,
[1614.54 → 1615.06] even here,
[1615.20 → 1616.06] even now,
[1617.50 → 1618.20] follow me.
[1619.26 → 1619.62] Yes,
[1619.86 → 1620.76] die to yourself
[1620.76 → 1622.54] and rise to life
[1622.54 → 1623.06] in Jesus
[1623.06 → 1624.12] who says to us,
[1624.34 → 1625.90] my burden is light,
[1626.94 → 1628.28] my yoke is not heavy,
[1628.48 → 1629.26] learn from me
[1629.26 → 1630.36] for I'm gentle
[1630.36 → 1631.84] and humble in heart.
[1632.20 → 1632.52] Yes,
[1632.68 → 1633.96] you'll die to your desires,
[1634.06 → 1634.94] you'll die to your ambitions,
[1635.06 → 1636.02] but you'll rise
[1636.02 → 1637.68] in resurrection power
[1637.68 → 1638.38] and life.
[1638.80 → 1640.00] You'll receive the spirit
[1640.00 → 1640.62] who produces
[1640.62 → 1641.82] the life of Jesus
[1641.82 → 1643.32] and the fruit of righteousness
[1643.32 → 1645.64] and you will live.
[1647.60 → 1648.32] And hope,
[1649.02 → 1650.38] I pray that this is a season
[1650.38 → 1651.62] where we respond
[1651.62 → 1653.08] to that call
[1653.08 → 1654.90] in humility
[1654.90 → 1656.68] with a desire
[1656.68 → 1657.54] and a hunger
[1657.54 → 1658.30] from the spirit
[1658.30 → 1660.08] to be those people
[1660.08 → 1660.66] who say,
[1660.66 → 1661.68] Lord,
[1662.46 → 1663.36] teach me
[1663.36 → 1665.30] to follow you.
[1666.50 → 1668.12] May you be the centre
[1668.12 → 1670.38] that gives coherence
[1670.38 → 1671.14] and purpose
[1671.14 → 1672.42] and meaning
[1672.42 → 1673.24] to us,
[1673.76 → 1674.90] to my life,
[1675.02 → 1675.66] my family,
[1675.90 → 1677.08] and everything I do.
[1678.88 → 1679.16] Amen.
[1680.48 → 1681.36] Let's pray.
[1681.36 → 1681.46] Amen.
[1681.46 → 1686.92] Father,
[1687.00 → 1687.46] I pray
[1687.46 → 1689.36] that even now
[1689.36 → 1691.48] as we let these words
[1691.48 → 1692.22] sink in
[1692.22 → 1693.18] that you would minister
[1693.18 → 1693.78] to us,
[1694.66 → 1696.96] that you would speak
[1696.96 → 1697.96] into the frustration
[1697.96 → 1699.62] perhaps of seasons
[1699.62 → 1700.88] of dry wilderness
[1700.88 → 1701.60] walking,
[1702.74 → 1703.40] the frustration
[1703.40 → 1704.60] with slow growth,
[1705.94 → 1706.50] the sense
[1706.50 → 1707.84] of coasting along.
[1709.00 → 1709.96] And I pray
[1709.96 → 1710.56] that the words
[1710.56 → 1710.98] of Jesus
[1710.98 → 1712.30] would be good news
[1712.30 → 1712.86] to us.
[1714.82 → 1715.56] Teach us,
[1715.68 → 1715.76] Lord,
[1715.82 → 1716.36] to follow,
[1717.58 → 1718.50] to die
[1718.50 → 1719.32] to ourselves
[1719.32 → 1721.34] and find life
[1721.34 → 1721.94] in the kingdom
[1721.94 → 1722.48] of God.
[1723.64 → 1724.34] Teach us
[1724.34 → 1725.06] to rise
[1725.06 → 1725.80] with Christ
[1725.80 → 1728.00] and be with Him,
[1728.84 → 1729.94] become like Him,
[1730.70 → 1731.70] and do what He does.
[1732.78 → 1733.24] Amen.
[1735.82 → 1736.62] This morning,
[1736.74 → 1737.68] we get the privilege
[1737.68 → 1738.62] of celebrating
[1738.62 → 1739.60] communion together
[1739.60 → 1741.04] and as I get
[1741.04 → 1741.80] a few things ready,
[1741.90 → 1742.40] I invite you
[1742.40 → 1743.04] to do the same.
[1743.42 → 1743.84] I invite you
[1743.84 → 1744.48] to grab a loaf
[1744.48 → 1744.96] of bread,
[1745.10 → 1745.44] bread,
[1745.68 → 1746.00] juice,
[1746.12 → 1746.56] or wine,
[1746.98 → 1747.46] and we will
[1747.46 → 1748.42] break bread together.
[1759.64 → 1760.02] You know,
[1760.06 → 1761.06] these last few days
[1761.06 → 1761.56] I've been thinking
[1761.56 → 1762.28] about food.
[1763.08 → 1763.52] I've been eating
[1763.52 → 1764.26] a lot of it too.
[1764.26 → 1766.02] And it struck me
[1766.02 → 1766.76] a couple of days ago
[1766.76 → 1767.30] as I was making
[1767.30 → 1767.78] Solihull
[1767.78 → 1768.68] and how important
[1768.68 → 1770.22] food is for us,
[1770.30 → 1771.12] especially food
[1771.12 → 1771.94] that's not just a meal
[1771.94 → 1772.36] but somehow
[1772.36 → 1773.48] how meals themselves
[1773.48 → 1774.80] are about identity
[1774.80 → 1776.18] and about who we are
[1776.18 → 1777.10] and something about
[1777.10 → 1777.68] feasting
[1777.68 → 1778.82] is so critical
[1778.82 → 1780.54] to who we are.
[1782.28 → 1782.76] For
[1782.76 → 1785.16] 2,020 years now,
[1786.00 → 1786.86] the church
[1786.86 → 1788.02] has been celebrating
[1788.02 → 1788.68] this meal,
[1789.72 → 1790.46] breaking bread,
[1791.86 → 1792.64] drinking the cup,
[1792.64 → 1794.64] and this meal
[1794.64 → 1795.56] in particular
[1795.56 → 1796.98] is a meal
[1796.98 → 1797.84] about identity.
[1798.66 → 1799.08] It's a way
[1799.08 → 1800.02] of brothers and sisters
[1800.02 → 1800.92] in Jesus saying
[1800.92 → 1803.48] this is who we are.
[1804.68 → 1805.90] We are the body
[1805.90 → 1806.50] of Christ
[1806.50 → 1807.46] set free
[1807.46 → 1808.34] by the body
[1808.34 → 1809.16] and the blood
[1809.16 → 1809.60] of Jesus
[1809.60 → 1810.98] on the cross.
[1812.20 → 1813.02] And I want to read
[1813.02 → 1813.96] for us as words
[1813.96 → 1814.60] of invitation,
[1815.06 → 1815.32] words,
[1815.40 → 1815.66] and I'm going to
[1815.66 → 1816.26] pluralize them.
[1816.30 → 1816.72] This comes from
[1816.72 → 1818.12] Galatians 2,20.
[1819.48 → 1820.42] We have been
[1820.42 → 1821.80] crucified with Christ
[1821.80 → 1822.96] who lives
[1822.96 → 1833.82] and gave himself
[1833.82 → 1835.46] up for us.
[1837.26 → 1838.14] The night Jesus
[1838.14 → 1838.94] was betrayed,
[1839.82 → 1840.54] he took bread
[1840.54 → 1842.12] and then he had
[1842.12 → 1842.62] broken it
[1842.62 → 1843.22] saying to his
[1843.22 → 1843.60] disciples,
[1843.96 → 1845.48] this is my body
[1845.48 → 1847.02] given for you.
[1848.10 → 1848.84] In the same way,
[1848.90 → 1849.80] Jesus took the cup
[1849.80 → 1851.42] and after he had
[1851.42 → 1851.74] poured it,
[1851.76 → 1852.34] he said to his
[1852.34 → 1852.72] disciples,
[1853.32 → 1854.54] this is my blood
[1854.54 → 1855.80] poured out
[1855.80 → 1856.78] for you.
[1859.24 → 1860.18] Brothers and sisters,
[1860.30 → 1861.12] whenever we eat
[1861.12 → 1861.82] this bread
[1861.82 → 1863.86] and drink this cup,
[1864.24 → 1865.20] we proclaim
[1865.20 → 1866.88] the Lord's death
[1866.88 → 1868.30] until he comes again
[1868.30 → 1869.42] in glory
[1869.42 → 1870.14] and power.
[1871.16 → 1871.56] And so,
[1872.22 → 1873.54] I invite you
[1873.54 → 1874.20] to take,
[1875.34 → 1875.72] eat,
[1876.46 → 1876.90] remember,
[1876.90 → 1877.58] and believe
[1877.58 → 1878.20] that the body
[1878.20 → 1878.64] of Christ
[1878.64 → 1879.08] was given
[1879.08 → 1880.14] for the complete
[1880.14 → 1880.60] forgiveness
[1880.60 → 1882.32] of all our sins.
[1899.78 → 1900.26] Take,
[1901.14 → 1901.76] drink,
[1902.52 → 1903.02] remember,
[1903.24 → 1903.68] and believe
[1903.68 → 1904.28] that the blood
[1904.28 → 1904.78] of Christ
[1904.78 → 1905.36] was shed
[1905.36 → 1906.52] for the complete
[1906.52 → 1906.92] forgiveness
[1906.92 → 1908.06] of all our sins.
[1923.50 → 1924.40] Would you join me
[1924.40 → 1924.76] in prayer?
[1930.24 → 1930.70] Father,
[1930.76 → 1931.22] you've spoken
[1931.22 → 1931.78] to us
[1931.78 → 1932.56] in worship,
[1932.56 → 1932.62] worship,
[1933.36 → 1934.20] you've ministered
[1934.20 → 1934.64] to us
[1934.64 → 1935.40] by the word,
[1936.02 → 1936.98] and you've given
[1936.98 → 1937.64] us the gift
[1937.64 → 1938.50] of Christ's presence
[1938.50 → 1939.46] through this meal.
[1940.96 → 1941.32] And Lord,
[1941.38 → 1942.16] we pray that it
[1942.16 → 1943.12] would nourish us,
[1944.14 → 1945.00] it would nourish
[1945.00 → 1945.94] the whole of our
[1945.94 → 1946.50] lives
[1946.50 → 1948.24] to be the body
[1948.24 → 1948.84] of Christ.
[1949.98 → 1950.56] And Lord,
[1950.64 → 1951.04] we pray
[1951.04 → 1953.08] that we would know
[1953.08 → 1953.98] what it looks like
[1953.98 → 1955.68] in our workplaces
[1955.68 → 1957.42] to live as the body
[1957.42 → 1957.96] of Christ.
[1957.96 → 1958.00] Christ,
[1958.68 → 1959.94] we pray that you
[1959.94 → 1960.30] would give us
[1960.30 → 1961.24] a creative ability
[1961.24 → 1961.94] to live
[1961.94 → 1963.32] as a unified
[1963.32 → 1963.88] fellowship
[1963.88 → 1965.26] in this season.
[1966.42 → 1966.96] And Lord,
[1967.04 → 1967.48] we pray
[1967.48 → 1969.02] that in this meal
[1969.02 → 1970.00] you would say
[1970.00 → 1970.76] to us again
[1970.76 → 1971.50] those words
[1971.50 → 1972.32] we need to hear,
[1973.58 → 1973.92] forgiven.
[1975.74 → 1976.30] Thank you
[1976.30 → 1977.04] for the cross.
[1978.14 → 1978.70] Thank you
[1978.70 → 1979.68] for the empty tomb.
[1980.84 → 1981.24] Thank you
[1981.24 → 1981.74] that Jesus
[1981.74 → 1982.98] is at the right hand
[1982.98 → 1984.42] and that we have
[1984.42 → 1985.24] the Holy Spirit.
[1985.24 → 1986.74] Amen.
[1989.16 → 1989.82] I invite you
[1989.82 → 1990.38] to stand
[1990.38 → 1991.10] in your homes
[1991.10 → 1991.74] and join us
[1991.74 → 1992.74] for a closing song
[1992.74 → 1993.20] of worship.
