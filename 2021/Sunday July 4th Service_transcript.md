[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Thank you.
[92.78 --> 95.12]  Yeah, it's hard to stop some good jazz piano.
[95.26 --> 96.82]  You're like, you know, the sermon can wait, Dave.
[96.90 --> 97.74]  The sermon can wait.
[99.28 --> 101.12]  It's so good to see you again.
[101.56 --> 106.88]  I will say there's been several months where it's been a little lonely in here, and it's
[106.88 --> 108.32]  just a gift to have you back.
[108.54 --> 110.50]  And some of you, I just want to say welcome.
[111.32 --> 112.90]  I know some of you found us online.
[113.48 --> 116.42]  Some of you came once before the pandemic, and you're back.
[116.52 --> 119.76]  And I just want to say it's so good to have you back, and it's so good to have you here.
[120.34 --> 121.06]  Welcome to worship.
[121.86 --> 123.24]  We're way better in person.
[123.90 --> 124.90]  Way better in person.
[125.80 --> 129.42]  Before we read the scriptures, I just want to say a few words about worship and regathering.
[129.48 --> 132.48]  And the main thing I want to say is we want to regather.
[133.24 --> 136.64]  We want you to participate again in the shared life of our church.
[137.04 --> 138.86]  The live stream has been amazing.
[139.14 --> 142.18]  We're so grateful for the way it's carried us over the last number of months and the way
[142.18 --> 144.64]  it's connected new people to our community in the last number of months.
[144.64 --> 148.00]  But we want you, whether you've been here a long time or you're brand new, we want you
[148.00 --> 150.68]  to be part of our shared life as a church.
[151.14 --> 153.96]  The live stream is not the church.
[154.52 --> 160.30]  It's a few of us on Sunday morning on the stage, but the live stream does not carry what
[160.30 --> 161.64]  a church community is.
[162.02 --> 164.42]  I'm sure you felt that over the last number of weeks.
[164.96 --> 171.40]  You haven't been to Hope until you've heard Jerry Hanlon's pre-garbage cleanup rant or tasted
[171.40 --> 173.08]  May Baldy's Baldy Soup.
[173.08 --> 173.96]  It has a name.
[173.96 --> 174.86]  It's Baldy Soup.
[175.20 --> 180.06]  Or gotten a hug from Chuck Gerber or been part of corporate worship, right?
[181.10 --> 184.50]  Those who have come over the last few weeks have said they did not realize how much they
[184.50 --> 187.30]  missed worship until they gathered again.
[187.46 --> 191.54]  In fact, I won't say who, but one of the elders said to me, maybe we can shorten the sermon
[191.54 --> 193.22]  so we can have a little more singing.
[193.34 --> 195.42]  We don't miss your sermons, but we do miss the singing.
[195.76 --> 197.78]  And I said, why can't we have the best of both worlds?
[199.58 --> 203.80]  Six months ago, I had someone say to me that the live stream made them lazy.
[203.96 --> 207.48]  And that statement really stuck with me, that the live stream made them lazy.
[208.32 --> 212.52]  And what they meant by that is as they watch the live stream from home, it's passive.
[213.24 --> 214.36]  They're not listening to people.
[214.48 --> 215.54]  They're not engaging with people.
[215.64 --> 218.12]  They're not serving people and being with people.
[218.34 --> 220.20]  They're passively receiving the service.
[220.32 --> 222.22]  And I realize that that is an insightful comment.
[222.22 --> 228.20]  And for some of us, over the next few weeks, we want to break some habits of passively receiving
[228.20 --> 232.30]  a Sunday morning worship service and regathering as the body of Christ.
[232.68 --> 233.32]  Does that sound good?
[234.38 --> 236.34]  Now, that being said, no one said anything.
[236.42 --> 237.02]  I'm getting nervous.
[237.68 --> 239.28]  That being said, the live stream will still continue.
[239.40 --> 242.30]  We realize that not everyone is comfortable yet gathering in person.
[242.68 --> 244.24]  Not everyone can gather in person.
[244.36 --> 246.44]  We know that there are people who wish they could be here but can't.
[246.44 --> 248.00]  The service will still be online.
[248.42 --> 251.98]  In the fall, it's probably going to change a little bit but we'll let you know before
[251.98 --> 252.64]  that happens.
[253.30 --> 257.72]  And also know if you're online and you're a little bit cautious, we have spaced out some
[257.72 --> 261.24]  of our seats so that you can join us in person at a distance that you're comfortable with.
[261.52 --> 263.58]  But we would love to see you when you're ready.
[263.58 --> 269.46]  You know, you should know that as staff, we were guessing how many people would come on
[269.46 --> 269.98]  Sunday morning.
[270.66 --> 273.74]  And I won't say what my bet was, but more people are here than I guessed.
[276.76 --> 279.02]  We're going to jump back into our series on the book of Exodus.
[279.26 --> 284.06]  Last week, if you were here, we overviewed how Exodus fits within the bigger biblical story.
[284.56 --> 289.20]  We traced sort of the three major movements of the book of Exodus itself, which you all remember
[289.20 --> 290.12]  perfectly, I'm sure.
[290.12 --> 294.88]  In the first 18 chapters, God delivers his people from slavery.
[295.16 --> 297.20]  He rescues them by his mighty hands.
[297.66 --> 302.86]  In chapters 19 to 24, God binds this little slave nation to himself in a covenant of love.
[303.36 --> 308.88]  And then chapters 25 to 40, the third part of Exodus, God dwells in the midst of his people.
[309.68 --> 314.38]  And this morning, we're going to be looking at the story of Moses, his part in God's story,
[314.54 --> 319.90]  recognizing that Moses is part of God's bigger plan of rescue and deliverance.
[319.90 --> 325.36]  So if you have your Bible, turn with me to Exodus chapter 3, and we're going to read of God's
[325.36 --> 327.64]  calling to Moses from the burning bush.
[329.80 --> 331.52]  This is Exodus chapter 3.
[331.52 --> 339.60]  Now Moses was tending to the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian.
[340.24 --> 345.20]  And he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of
[345.20 --> 345.50]  God.
[346.38 --> 350.62]  There, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush.
[351.60 --> 354.64]  Moses saw that though the bush was on fire, it did not burn up.
[354.64 --> 359.68]  So Moses thought, I will go over and see this strange sight, why this bush doesn't burn up.
[360.70 --> 364.78]  When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush,
[365.22 --> 366.96]  Moses, Moses.
[368.00 --> 370.68]  And Moses said, here I am.
[371.66 --> 374.06]  Do not come any closer, God said.
[374.18 --> 378.14]  Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
[378.14 --> 383.14]  Then he said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
[383.14 --> 383.74]  God of Jacob.
[384.38 --> 389.66]  And at this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to even look at God.
[391.02 --> 395.06]  The Lord said, I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt.
[395.78 --> 400.62]  I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their
[400.62 --> 401.20]  suffering.
[402.00 --> 407.08]  So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out
[407.08 --> 413.06]  of that land into the good and spacious land, the land flowing with milk and honey, the home
[413.06 --> 417.98]  of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hibitites, and Jebusites.
[418.82 --> 424.16]  And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are
[424.16 --> 424.80]  oppressing them.
[424.86 --> 426.42]  So now, go.
[427.28 --> 433.60]  I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.
[437.08 --> 446.02]  If you were to pull out your phone and go on Google after the service and punch in Heroes
[446.02 --> 451.26]  of the Bible, you're going to get a lot of blog posts and websites and children's books
[451.26 --> 457.96]  that walk you through all these, quote, Heroes of the Bible, like King David or Esther or Mary
[457.96 --> 460.50]  or Moses or the Apostle Paul.
[461.04 --> 462.76]  There's lots of these books around.
[462.76 --> 465.60]  And of course, Moses is always in these books.
[466.40 --> 468.12]  He's a big deal, right?
[468.42 --> 470.68]  He's the one who stood toe-to-toe with Pharaoh.
[470.84 --> 475.78]  He led the people out of Egypt in slavery, and he brought the tablets of the law down from
[475.78 --> 476.36]  Mount Sinai.
[476.44 --> 478.82]  He's one of the great, quote, Heroes of the Bible.
[480.38 --> 481.38]  But here's the thing.
[482.52 --> 488.14]  In my opinion, I don't think that's an appropriate title for Moses or any other biblical character
[488.14 --> 488.82]  for that matter.
[489.68 --> 493.62]  And if you read through Exodus 2 to 6, and I do encourage you to do that over the course
[493.62 --> 501.16]  of this week, you're going to read a story of a very human Moses, a very flawed Moses
[501.16 --> 508.48]  with doubts, with questions, with a checkered past involving murder, a person who runs away
[508.48 --> 509.22]  out of fear.
[509.62 --> 511.42]  This is a human character.
[511.42 --> 516.18]  And my sense is if Moses were to frame it, it wouldn't be as a hero of the Bible.
[516.28 --> 522.44]  He would say, this is a story of me and all my ordinariness and my fears and my doubts
[522.44 --> 527.24]  encountering the true hero of the Bible, God.
[528.02 --> 535.16]  And that true hero graciously draws me into his redemptive purposes and invites me to play
[535.16 --> 536.86]  my little part.
[537.66 --> 539.74]  That's how I think Moses would tell it.
[539.74 --> 546.86]  And this is the story of the great hero calling to Moses from the burning bush saying, I have
[546.86 --> 549.74]  a role for you in my story of redemption.
[551.96 --> 552.32]  C.S.
[552.36 --> 555.76]  Lewis has this interesting quote on how God works in the Bible.
[556.58 --> 558.84]  And this is what he says about God working through people.
[558.96 --> 565.78]  He writes, God seems to do nothing of himself which he can possibly delegate to his creatures.
[565.78 --> 573.80]  He commands us to do slowly and blunderingly what he could do perfectly and in the twinkling
[573.80 --> 574.74]  of an eye.
[575.76 --> 580.68]  And that really is one of the unique, mysterious things about God in the Scriptures.
[581.16 --> 583.18]  And that's true in the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[583.38 --> 590.32]  God always partners with and works through humans in all their flaws, with all their fears,
[590.32 --> 596.64]  with all their foibles, and accomplishes his plan partnering with them, including Moses,
[597.36 --> 601.32]  including Israel, including you and me here in the church this morning.
[602.00 --> 603.48]  God partners with people.
[604.14 --> 611.26]  And in Moses' case, God chooses to work through him as a mediator to confront Pharaoh, to speak
[611.26 --> 615.00]  his word to Pharaoh, and to lead his people out of slavery.
[615.00 --> 622.86]  Now, let's take a look at this person called Moses, this character that we know fairly quite
[622.86 --> 627.94]  a bit about, I think, who, by the way, in this passage, is called at the age of 80.
[628.60 --> 633.14]  So, if you just, like, settled into retirement, and I know someone this morning just did, just
[633.14 --> 633.66]  watch out.
[634.08 --> 636.10]  When you turn 80, things could change.
[637.68 --> 639.98]  Moses was born in the context of genocide.
[640.58 --> 644.36]  As we looked at last week, Pharaoh being threatened by the slave nation that was growing,
[644.36 --> 649.26]  said, I want to oppress them, and all the boys born in Israel to be thrown into the Nile.
[649.76 --> 652.64]  He wants to eliminate the future of Israel.
[653.28 --> 657.88]  And Moses was born in the middle of all that, and his mom bravely hid him for three months,
[657.98 --> 661.20]  and then took a very calculated risk, knowing what was before her.
[661.58 --> 666.12]  She built a papyrus basket that would float in the Nile, and she placed Moses in it in hopes
[666.12 --> 667.42]  that somehow he would live.
[668.34 --> 672.80]  This isn't in the scriptures, but I just have this hunch that, like a good, protective mother,
[672.80 --> 675.86]  she did everything she could to give him a chance at living.
[675.96 --> 680.12]  And I happen to think she probably knew precisely when Pharaoh's daughter was going to be bathing
[680.12 --> 682.24]  in the Nile, and the attendants would be there.
[682.38 --> 686.00]  And so she puts Moses in the Nile, knowing that this could be his route out.
[686.44 --> 692.26]  And lo and behold, Pharaoh's daughter's attendant sees this little basket in the Nile, brings
[692.26 --> 696.84]  this baby to the daughter, and Moses is adopted into Pharaoh's household.
[696.84 --> 700.14]  Now, we don't know very much about Moses' childhood.
[700.40 --> 702.50]  He was probably educated among the best.
[702.92 --> 707.42]  He grew up in the lap of luxury in the Egyptian palace, and I happen to think he had some tension,
[707.88 --> 709.62]  knowing that he is an Israelite.
[709.66 --> 711.42]  He was born into the Israelite nation.
[711.54 --> 712.48]  He was part of the slaves.
[712.84 --> 718.78]  And yet here he is in luxury while his own family, and perhaps the people that he grew
[718.78 --> 722.62]  up with or his family grew up with, are being beaten down with whips as slaves.
[722.62 --> 730.16]  In Exodus 2, we get three snapshots of Moses' life before he was called by God from the
[730.16 --> 730.72]  burning bush.
[731.30 --> 735.98]  And I find these snapshots fascinating, first of all, and I find them showing us a lot about
[735.98 --> 736.78]  Moses' character.
[737.72 --> 743.84]  Snapshot number one, Moses is in Egypt, and he looks out and he sees an Egyptian beating
[743.84 --> 745.20]  an Israelite slave.
[745.70 --> 746.32]  And what does he do?
[747.04 --> 747.62]  You know what he does?
[747.62 --> 753.00]  He goes out there and he strikes the Egyptian down, kills him, and buries him in the sand.
[753.94 --> 754.54]  That's Moses.
[754.74 --> 757.88]  You know, we often have this image of like this old gray man, but he just took out an
[757.88 --> 759.08]  Egyptian and buried him in the sand.
[760.54 --> 765.08]  Snapshot number two, he sees two Israelites quarreling between each other, and he goes in
[765.08 --> 766.64]  there to mediate this conflict.
[767.44 --> 771.38]  And one of the Israelites says to Moses, whoa, whoa, whoa, are you going to do to us what you
[771.38 --> 772.08]  did to that Egyptian?
[772.28 --> 774.32]  We know about what you did to that Egyptian.
[774.32 --> 779.50]  And of course, Moses is now wracked with fear because the word got out about his murder.
[780.24 --> 783.12]  And the Pharaoh, in fact, even finds out about his murder and wants to kill Moses.
[783.20 --> 783.78]  So what does he do?
[784.26 --> 785.64]  He does what any normal human would do.
[785.70 --> 787.62]  He runs away to Nowhereville in Midian.
[788.64 --> 790.40]  And this is where we get snapshot number three.
[791.28 --> 796.26]  Moses is near a well in Midian, and there's seven daughters of a priest, and they're watering
[796.26 --> 796.92]  their flock.
[797.46 --> 799.00]  And then these shepherds come in.
[799.12 --> 803.32]  They drive these women away, perhaps to hog the water, perhaps because they feel like they
[803.32 --> 804.48]  have a priority because they're men.
[804.92 --> 809.06]  And Moses, who just can't leave well enough alone, he comes in again.
[809.56 --> 812.94]  And again, there's no details in the story, but I would just love to know what he does
[812.94 --> 813.20]  here.
[813.54 --> 818.22]  But he somehow scatters these shepherds, deals with them, and then feeds these flock for
[818.22 --> 818.54]  the women.
[819.96 --> 823.36]  And I don't know what kind of training Moses had when he was young, but man, this guy's
[823.36 --> 823.98]  something fierce.
[824.84 --> 828.28]  Perhaps he did some MMA training in Egypt, but you would not want to mess with Moses.
[828.82 --> 829.76]  He can deal with shepherds.
[829.78 --> 830.62]  He can take good Egyptians.
[830.62 --> 832.28]  He's a force to be reckoned with.
[833.28 --> 836.94]  But these three snapshots give us a picture of Moses' character.
[838.26 --> 843.96]  Although he grew up in the lap of luxury in Egypt, his heart beats for his people.
[844.70 --> 848.18]  He just can't not care for the Israelites.
[848.36 --> 851.88]  He can't not interfere when one of his own people is being beaten.
[851.96 --> 855.36]  He can't not try to mediate when two Israelites are quarreling.
[855.36 --> 859.76]  And he can't stop himself from caring for these vulnerable Midianite women.
[860.94 --> 865.30]  And you can already begin to see how this is the person who's fit for the job, right?
[865.46 --> 868.96]  Born in Israel, raised in Egypt, cares deeply for his people.
[869.06 --> 871.20]  He knows the ways of the Egyptians and Pharaoh.
[871.68 --> 877.24]  This is the guy that God's going to choose to mediate, to speak, and confront the world
[877.24 --> 878.36]  leader of the day.
[878.36 --> 881.90]  And it's here in the obscurity of Midian.
[882.04 --> 883.18]  Moses is just a shepherd.
[883.36 --> 884.26]  He's caring for a flock.
[884.36 --> 885.48]  He's doing his thing in Midian.
[885.96 --> 887.74]  That's where God shows up and meets him.
[888.64 --> 892.56]  In this obscure place far from Egypt, God shows up in this burning bush.
[892.68 --> 896.52]  Perhaps Moses sees this bush thinking that the teenage pyromaniacs are at it again.
[896.80 --> 899.34]  Goes near the bush and he realizes this is not like other fires.
[899.64 --> 900.50]  This bush isn't burning.
[900.86 --> 906.20]  And lo and behold, it's God showing up, speaking directly to Moses, calling him into his mission.
[906.20 --> 909.20]  And I want to read for you again what God says to him.
[936.20 --> 941.48]  You, to Pharaoh, to bring my people, the Israelites, out of slavery.
[943.22 --> 944.18]  Pause right there.
[945.22 --> 947.90]  How do you think Moses responded to this calling?
[949.44 --> 950.26]  Think he was excited?
[951.00 --> 951.94]  Think he was nervous?
[952.72 --> 953.66]  Think he was scared?
[954.36 --> 955.12]  You can say it out loud.
[955.18 --> 955.82]  We're together now.
[957.72 --> 958.36]  Say it again.
[958.40 --> 959.22]  I heard two men at once.
[960.14 --> 960.58]  Fear?
[960.92 --> 961.32]  Terrified?
[961.56 --> 963.10]  I think you nailed it there, Stu.
[963.10 --> 966.44]  I think Moses would be shaking in his boots.
[967.08 --> 968.14]  Moses knows Pharaoh.
[968.36 --> 969.12]  He knows Egypt.
[969.22 --> 971.00]  He knows exactly what he ran away from.
[971.12 --> 974.28]  And this, in his mind, was probably straight up death sentence.
[975.08 --> 975.24]  Right?
[975.84 --> 976.74]  Straight up death sentence.
[977.12 --> 982.34]  Okay, Moses, I want you to walk to the most powerful person in the area, leading the most
[982.34 --> 983.18]  powerful nation.
[983.32 --> 988.14]  And I want you to go say to him, hey, Pharaoh, you know that slave nation that's building your
[988.14 --> 988.76]  whole empire?
[989.00 --> 992.30]  That's creating the jobs of sustaining all your power and your wealth?
[992.30 --> 994.58]  Yeah, can you just let that whole slave nation go?
[995.58 --> 996.52]  Does that sound like a good plan?
[997.24 --> 999.80]  They need to go worship some other God that you don't even know about.
[1000.08 --> 1000.86]  How's that sound?
[1001.48 --> 1003.92]  And for Moses, that's like an execution sentence.
[1004.38 --> 1005.76]  And so, yes, he's terrified.
[1006.30 --> 1011.36]  And in the next chapter and a half, from chapter three and four in Exodus, Moses does everything
[1011.36 --> 1014.56]  he can, everything he can to get out of this calling.
[1014.96 --> 1016.64]  It's like a thanks, no thanks.
[1016.64 --> 1021.26]  And I want to summarize the five things that Moses says in response to God.
[1021.36 --> 1023.76]  And I'm going to put each of his excuses up on the screen.
[1024.52 --> 1031.14]  Right after God says to Moses, I'm sending you, his first statement is, whoa, who am I?
[1031.94 --> 1034.42]  Who am I that, like, you want me to go to Pharaoh?
[1034.48 --> 1036.04]  I'm just doing my thing as a shepherd.
[1036.22 --> 1037.08]  I'm here in Midian.
[1037.28 --> 1038.38]  I don't want to go back to Egypt.
[1038.78 --> 1040.28]  This is not my jam.
[1040.74 --> 1041.88]  That's Moses' first excuse.
[1041.96 --> 1043.06]  Who am I?
[1043.06 --> 1047.54]  And God's response is, Moses, I'll be with you.
[1048.52 --> 1049.80]  This isn't a you project.
[1050.28 --> 1051.34]  This is a me project.
[1052.54 --> 1054.66]  Then Moses comes back with his second excuse.
[1055.34 --> 1060.46]  He says, okay, so I go back to the people, the people of Israel to tell them the plan.
[1060.86 --> 1062.08]  What am I going to say to them?
[1062.26 --> 1065.50]  What are they going to make sense of in this plan of yours?
[1066.02 --> 1072.20]  And God's response graciously is, tell them that the I am has sent you.
[1073.88 --> 1075.42]  Here comes excuse number three.
[1076.64 --> 1081.16]  What if the people of Israel hear all that you've said to me, hear about this meeting
[1081.16 --> 1084.28]  we've had and the calling I have to lead them out, and they just straight up don't believe
[1084.28 --> 1084.48]  it.
[1084.86 --> 1086.42]  They don't actually think this is going to happen.
[1087.62 --> 1092.80]  God replies again, graciously saying, Moses, I've thought this through.
[1093.20 --> 1096.88]  I'm going to give you signs and wonders that you'll perform that show this is not you.
[1096.98 --> 1098.08]  This is me operating.
[1098.20 --> 1099.40]  You put your staff on the ground.
[1099.48 --> 1100.22]  It's going to become a snake.
[1100.48 --> 1101.46]  Put your hand in your cloak.
[1101.56 --> 1101.98]  Take it out.
[1101.98 --> 1103.02]  It'll be full of leprosy.
[1103.10 --> 1103.86]  You put it back in.
[1104.00 --> 1104.70]  It will be healed.
[1104.82 --> 1106.22]  I will show my power, Moses.
[1106.88 --> 1107.54]  Don't worry.
[1109.70 --> 1110.54]  Fourth excuse.
[1111.06 --> 1112.50]  Moses changes course altogether.
[1113.64 --> 1115.42]  Lord, I'm not eloquent.
[1115.92 --> 1117.04]  I don't like public speaking.
[1117.16 --> 1120.12]  I don't like public confrontation, especially to pharaohs who want to kill me.
[1120.34 --> 1121.82]  I do not want to speak.
[1123.16 --> 1124.08]  God's response.
[1125.02 --> 1126.38]  Moses, who made your tongue?
[1127.22 --> 1127.88]  That's what he says to him.
[1127.88 --> 1128.68]  Who created the tongue?
[1128.68 --> 1130.64]  I will help you speak.
[1131.72 --> 1133.42]  And here's the fifth and final excuse.
[1133.56 --> 1139.46]  This is my favorite excuse where Moses just says, please send someone else.
[1140.02 --> 1142.10]  I don't want to do this.
[1142.94 --> 1146.64]  And then God's reply, and this is my summary, is Moses, I'm losing my patience.
[1147.30 --> 1148.36]  Aaron's already on his way.
[1148.60 --> 1149.70]  He's going to speak for you.
[1149.88 --> 1150.74]  We've got this.
[1150.74 --> 1156.10]  So, in my opinion, this is a fascinating dialogue, don't you think?
[1156.24 --> 1157.42]  God shows up in a burning bush.
[1157.54 --> 1160.10]  He's showing his holiness, his glory, his power.
[1160.22 --> 1161.38]  Moses can't even wear his sandals.
[1161.74 --> 1164.56]  And Moses, in every way, is trying to say, like, please somebody else.
[1164.72 --> 1165.58]  Please not me.
[1165.74 --> 1166.58]  I don't have what it takes.
[1166.66 --> 1167.62]  I don't want to do what it takes.
[1167.70 --> 1168.10]  I'm afraid.
[1168.30 --> 1171.92]  I don't even trust the Israelites to believe what's going on here.
[1173.10 --> 1175.42]  His doubts and his fears are in full display.
[1176.62 --> 1177.60]  And don't judge him.
[1177.60 --> 1180.94]  He's legitimately afraid of the Pharaoh.
[1181.90 --> 1186.64]  But notice now what God doesn't do in this passage.
[1187.78 --> 1193.54]  God doesn't do what 90% of self-help books on chapters in Barnes & Nobles do in this kind
[1193.54 --> 1194.12]  of conversation.
[1195.00 --> 1199.82]  The chapters books on self-help will say, Moses, just think deep within yourself.
[1199.94 --> 1200.70]  You've got this.
[1200.94 --> 1201.84]  Trust your instincts.
[1202.66 --> 1203.58]  Trust your heart.
[1203.96 --> 1204.66]  You can do this.
[1204.98 --> 1207.22]  Limitations are just imagined, Moses.
[1207.60 --> 1209.60]  To which he would say, that's insane.
[1210.26 --> 1211.70]  This is a death warrant.
[1212.40 --> 1213.64]  But what does God say instead?
[1213.80 --> 1218.56]  Every time Moses puts an excuse, every time Moses names his fears, God says to him, Moses,
[1218.88 --> 1220.34]  I'm sending you.
[1221.08 --> 1222.78]  I'm the one who's doing this.
[1223.04 --> 1223.98]  I'm going to equip you.
[1224.08 --> 1225.04]  I'm going to give you the words.
[1225.12 --> 1225.80]  I'm going to send Aaron.
[1226.06 --> 1228.78]  This is my project that I'm pulling you into.
[1229.14 --> 1233.14]  You just do your little part, and I will do what I'm going to do.
[1233.14 --> 1234.42]  I'm the Lord.
[1235.54 --> 1238.36]  And the answer is, of course Moses can't do this.
[1238.86 --> 1242.02]  Of course Moses doesn't have the ability to confront Pharaoh in his own strength.
[1242.26 --> 1243.96]  Of course he doesn't have the words.
[1244.56 --> 1245.50]  But God does.
[1246.20 --> 1250.46]  And in every case, with every fear, in all of his doubt, God says, this is my project
[1250.46 --> 1250.98]  of redemption.
[1250.98 --> 1257.04]  You play your part, and watch me do what I'm going to do.
[1258.90 --> 1262.72]  Of course this brings us to the bigger picture of Exodus 1 to 18.
[1263.50 --> 1266.12]  This is not the story of the hero Moses.
[1266.84 --> 1268.90]  This is the story of the hero God.
[1269.36 --> 1274.10]  This is a story of Moses confronting Pharaoh and realizing that he really does have God's
[1274.10 --> 1277.04]  power as he throws that staff down and he becomes a snake.
[1277.04 --> 1283.10]  This is really the story of Moses speaking through Aaron to Pharaoh and God himself confronting
[1283.10 --> 1288.52]  the false worship, the false deities, and the false worldview of Egypt.
[1289.46 --> 1299.62]  And as this whole story unfolds, Moses, Israel, Pharaoh, and the Egyptians see the living God
[1299.62 --> 1300.96]  displaying his power.
[1301.64 --> 1303.62]  This is not about what Moses can do.
[1303.62 --> 1307.56]  This is about every person who lives and is part of this narrative seeing that God can
[1307.56 --> 1308.24]  send plagues.
[1309.16 --> 1310.76]  God can judge false gods.
[1311.16 --> 1316.10]  God can take a little slave nation that's working for the Egyptian army or Egyptian empire
[1316.10 --> 1319.80]  and drag them right through the Red Sea and save them.
[1320.70 --> 1323.36]  This is a story about the power of God.
[1323.94 --> 1330.18]  And Moses, as he plays his little part, he, along with everyone else, witnesses Yahweh in
[1330.18 --> 1330.60]  action.
[1331.30 --> 1332.70]  I will be who I will be.
[1332.70 --> 1335.38]  God showing his character in real time.
[1337.88 --> 1342.00]  Now it's here that I want to pause and do some reflection with you on how this story
[1342.00 --> 1343.42]  speaks into our own context.
[1344.32 --> 1349.58]  I think it's easy, perhaps, to almost with a sigh of relief say, oh, I'm so glad I don't
[1349.58 --> 1350.30]  have that calling.
[1350.78 --> 1352.22]  I'm so glad I'm not Moses.
[1352.34 --> 1353.72]  I'm so glad I don't have to go to Pharaoh.
[1354.04 --> 1358.16]  You sort of place a lot of distance between us today and that calling of Moses then.
[1358.16 --> 1361.54]  And I happen to think this story has a lot to say to the church today.
[1362.42 --> 1367.58]  Because the same God who calls Moses and draws him into his plan, the same God who calls Israel
[1367.58 --> 1372.98]  and draws him into his plan, is the God who in Christ is forming the church and drawing
[1372.98 --> 1374.10]  us into his plan.
[1374.10 --> 1380.60]  God is still ascending God and God still invites all those who follow him to participate in
[1380.60 --> 1384.78]  his mission, to play our part in the biblical story.
[1384.78 --> 1390.18]  Those kids are having a good time up there.
[1391.92 --> 1392.66]  I think.
[1393.62 --> 1395.18]  Parents are all like nervously laughing.
[1396.62 --> 1400.74]  You know, I haven't been a pastor for a very long time, but I've grown up in the church and
[1400.74 --> 1405.38]  I know enough about the church to know that some of the doubts named by Moses are the doubts
[1405.38 --> 1409.82]  shared by so many believers, individually and also churches collectively.
[1410.70 --> 1414.44]  Who are we, God, to do this for your kingdom?
[1414.44 --> 1417.60]  Who are we that we have to speak and live as citizens of the kingdom?
[1417.80 --> 1421.14]  Who are we to confront oppression and idolatry and injustice in our city?
[1421.64 --> 1423.02]  We don't have the gifts.
[1423.48 --> 1424.44]  We don't have the skills.
[1424.58 --> 1425.36]  We're not eloquent.
[1425.74 --> 1427.38]  Our lives are a little checkered and broken.
[1427.74 --> 1429.14]  Don't you know what I've done in my past?
[1429.32 --> 1430.48]  I'm not the person.
[1431.06 --> 1432.06]  We're not the church.
[1432.24 --> 1438.22]  And we live with this functional doubt, this functional disbelief that we're called, that
[1438.22 --> 1445.88]  we're sent, and more pointedly, that God still acts today in power to make the name of Jesus
[1445.88 --> 1446.22]  known.
[1447.46 --> 1450.36]  We can see ourselves, perhaps, in some of these doubts.
[1450.48 --> 1454.34]  And I have a feeling there's many people, even in our own church, who have some sense
[1454.34 --> 1461.48]  of how we're called to serve, but are racked with doubt and fear of what could happen, what
[1461.48 --> 1465.26]  the consequences are, what could happen to our reputation if we really live and speak
[1465.26 --> 1466.72]  the gospel of Jesus.
[1468.50 --> 1472.58]  And I think there's this false narrative, even in the church today, of saying, maybe if I
[1472.58 --> 1476.96]  sort my life out just a little bit more, maybe if I get things put together a little
[1476.96 --> 1478.62]  bit more, then I'll be more useful for the kingdom.
[1478.76 --> 1481.38]  Then I'll be selected for what God has in mind for the church today.
[1481.38 --> 1482.48]  But here's the deal.
[1483.06 --> 1487.62]  In the biblical story, with Moses and all the other characters, God has a propensity
[1487.62 --> 1489.72]  to draw weak people.
[1490.44 --> 1491.14]  Did you know that?
[1492.16 --> 1497.18]  God calls weak people into his service, not the people who could do it all in their own
[1497.18 --> 1497.44]  strength.
[1497.50 --> 1498.66]  That's not who he's interested in.
[1498.80 --> 1500.06]  He's interested in people who are weak.
[1500.14 --> 1500.96]  He calls the doubters.
[1501.08 --> 1502.00]  He calls those who struggle.
[1502.28 --> 1503.44]  He calls those who are not faithful.
[1503.52 --> 1505.20]  And he says, I have a mission for you.
[1506.16 --> 1507.88]  And now you get to partner with me.
[1507.88 --> 1511.72]  And I'm the one who will equip you to do what I've called you to do.
[1513.70 --> 1518.24]  And no one says it's better, by the way, than the apostle Paul, who himself has a checkered
[1518.24 --> 1519.94]  past full of murder.
[1520.46 --> 1526.22]  Paul says in 2 Corinthians 12, verse 9, he writes, therefore, in order to keep me from
[1526.22 --> 1531.82]  becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me.
[1532.12 --> 1535.30]  Now, we have no idea what that thorn in the flesh is, which I think is actually a gift
[1535.30 --> 1536.94]  of the church, because we can fill in the blank.
[1537.82 --> 1542.00]  Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me, but he said to me, my grace
[1542.00 --> 1547.06]  is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.
[1548.10 --> 1553.00]  Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weakness, so that Christ's power may
[1553.00 --> 1554.96]  rest on me.
[1554.96 --> 1564.42]  I think the whole dialogue between Moses and God makes us ask some big questions about our
[1564.42 --> 1567.48]  own partnership with God and his mission in the world today.
[1568.28 --> 1572.80]  Do we really believe that God in Christ by his spirit is with us?
[1573.18 --> 1574.36]  That's the first thing he says to Moses.
[1574.50 --> 1576.24]  Moses, I'm with you.
[1576.96 --> 1579.80]  Do we believe that that same God is with us?
[1579.80 --> 1582.66]  And no, we're not called to the place of Egypt.
[1583.48 --> 1585.18]  Maybe a couple missionaries are.
[1585.76 --> 1590.68]  No, we're not called to confront the pharaoh of Egypt, but we are called to our city.
[1591.68 --> 1596.98]  We are called to the oppression of our city, the pharaohs and the voices of pharaohs in our
[1596.98 --> 1600.06]  day, the injustice, the violence, the oppressions, and the idolatry.
[1600.22 --> 1606.26]  We are called to confront and speak truth into those places, aren't we, church?
[1606.26 --> 1608.74]  Is that not how we are sent?
[1609.04 --> 1612.94]  And we have to ask the question, does Christ by his spirit go with us?
[1613.88 --> 1617.16]  And Jesus in Matthew 28 says, yes, I do.
[1617.60 --> 1618.92]  I'm with you, church.
[1619.44 --> 1623.18]  And in the same way, God equips all the weak people throughout the biblical story, so I
[1623.18 --> 1628.24]  will equip you to be my hands and my feet, my kingdom servants that point people to the
[1628.24 --> 1628.96]  reign of Christ.
[1630.06 --> 1630.98]  That's your mission.
[1631.80 --> 1635.32]  That's our small part in the biblical story.
[1636.26 --> 1643.48]  One of the beautiful things I love about this passage is how God responds to all of
[1643.48 --> 1644.10]  Moses' fears.
[1644.90 --> 1648.96]  And it's not just that God's sort of convincing Moses that he needs to do this little task,
[1649.00 --> 1649.86]  and it all depends on Moses.
[1649.94 --> 1651.40]  He honors Moses' humanity.
[1651.54 --> 1652.60]  He honors Moses' fears.
[1652.86 --> 1654.30]  But a lot of things he doesn't answer.
[1654.78 --> 1657.96]  But what's clear is God's got this, right?
[1658.94 --> 1660.68]  God knows exactly what needs to happen.
[1660.76 --> 1663.90]  It's not like God shows up to Moses and he has no idea how this thing's going to unfold.
[1663.90 --> 1665.88]  God's like, okay, I know you need wonders.
[1666.04 --> 1667.32]  I know you need to show signs.
[1667.58 --> 1669.04]  I know how do you need to speak.
[1669.34 --> 1671.22]  And by the way, Aaron's already walking.
[1671.84 --> 1675.42]  He's already walking to help you be the voice that confronts Pharaoh.
[1675.66 --> 1677.02]  I've got this, Moses.
[1677.86 --> 1680.04]  Trust me to do what I'm going to do.
[1680.44 --> 1682.26]  You play your small part.
[1683.92 --> 1684.94]  That's the message.
[1684.94 --> 1692.96]  You need to know that after this whole conversation, Moses responds in obedience.
[1694.18 --> 1698.48]  And I happen to think that Moses walked away from that conversation with his knees knocking.
[1699.36 --> 1700.66]  I think he was still afraid.
[1701.32 --> 1705.26]  I'm sure there were fears that God didn't even answer of his, of how do I know I'm going
[1705.26 --> 1706.42]  to live, God?
[1707.04 --> 1708.02]  God didn't answer that one.
[1708.72 --> 1709.62]  He didn't ask that one.
[1709.62 --> 1714.52]  I'm sure Moses walked away from that burning bush with deep sense of fear and caution for
[1714.52 --> 1720.86]  his life, but he walked in obedience, knowing that the God who spoke to him was going with
[1720.86 --> 1721.10]  him.
[1721.74 --> 1725.28]  And how this passage ends is so, so important.
[1725.46 --> 1726.80]  So Moses goes back to Israel.
[1727.28 --> 1731.02]  He speaks about what God said to him, about God's calling to him, about God heard their
[1731.02 --> 1731.46]  cries.
[1731.58 --> 1732.84]  He's responding to the oppression.
[1732.84 --> 1738.18]  And then we hear at the very end of all of it, in verse 31 of chapter 4, we read,
[1738.56 --> 1741.20]  And they, the Israelites, believed.
[1742.10 --> 1747.18]  And when they heard that the Lord was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed
[1747.18 --> 1749.52]  down and they worshiped.
[1751.18 --> 1752.40]  Just picture that scene.
[1753.74 --> 1760.42]  When they heard that God had heard, the God they knew very little about, they bowed down and
[1760.42 --> 1761.16]  they worshiped.
[1761.16 --> 1766.54]  Notice, they did not hoist Moses up on their shoulders as the people's champ.
[1767.26 --> 1769.54]  They did not celebrate all that Moses was going to do.
[1769.60 --> 1770.94]  They bowed down and they worshiped who?
[1772.42 --> 1775.22]  God, the hero of the story.
[1776.22 --> 1780.52]  And when you read the rest of Exodus and even further on as Moses leads the people, you realize
[1780.52 --> 1782.54]  pretty quickly, this is not the hero.
[1783.70 --> 1787.44]  This is not the person who's going to bring redemption to his people and to his world.
[1787.44 --> 1791.42]  And later, as the kings come, you realize those kings aren't the hero.
[1791.86 --> 1793.04]  They can't lead the people well.
[1793.08 --> 1794.66]  And the prophets come and they speak God's word.
[1794.88 --> 1796.24]  Those prophets aren't the heroes.
[1796.50 --> 1801.60]  And we realize finally at just the right time in history, when the oppression of the whole
[1801.60 --> 1804.82]  world, the sin and the weight of this whole world goes up, God responds.
[1804.82 --> 1805.54]  God responds.
[1806.54 --> 1808.66]  And the hero of all comes.
[1809.40 --> 1810.10]  And who is it?
[1811.10 --> 1812.04]  It's Christ.
[1813.00 --> 1814.90]  The son of the living God.
[1815.20 --> 1820.22]  Come to deal with the deepest source of oppression and violence and justice and wrong.
[1820.70 --> 1821.48]  And that is sin.
[1822.44 --> 1823.40]  And it's Satan.
[1823.40 --> 1825.24]  And it's death.
[1827.30 --> 1831.78]  And this morning, we're going to finish this sermon by gathering around the table of grace
[1831.78 --> 1838.08]  and centering our lives and our whole life as a church around the hero of our story.
[1838.80 --> 1840.02]  And that's Jesus Christ.
[1840.48 --> 1841.50]  The one who liberates.
[1841.88 --> 1842.72]  The one who rescues.
[1842.84 --> 1844.32]  The one who sets us free.
[1844.94 --> 1849.80]  And what I invite you to do, it's important, at least for me, that we do communion in an unhurried
[1849.80 --> 1850.18]  pace.
[1850.46 --> 1851.78]  This is not something we want to race through.
[1851.78 --> 1855.74]  And so I'm going to invite you into a time of prayerful preparation where you can bring
[1855.74 --> 1860.76]  your fears, your doubts, your struggles, your sins before the throne of grace.
[1860.96 --> 1862.08]  Bring those before God.
[1862.48 --> 1865.90]  And then whenever you're ready, there's no rush to this, go to the tables.
[1866.02 --> 1866.88]  There's four tables.
[1867.06 --> 1869.82]  We didn't feel like we could pass the plate yet, although maybe some of you are comfortable
[1869.82 --> 1870.20]  with that.
[1870.56 --> 1873.20]  We want you to grab the elements, grab the juice, grab the bread.
[1873.34 --> 1874.28]  Don't eat it there.
[1875.06 --> 1876.18]  Bring it back to your seat.
[1876.48 --> 1878.28]  And then I'm going to lead us through communion together.
[1878.44 --> 1879.00]  Does that sound good?
[1879.00 --> 1884.10]  All in light, Mark, our jazz pianist, he'll play some piano and we'll just spend some time
[1884.10 --> 1885.88]  in prayer as a family.
[1886.08 --> 1886.42]  Let's pray.
[1886.42 --> 1886.46]  Let's pray.
[1886.46 --> 1899.88]  Let's pray.
[1899.88 --> 1929.86]  рассказ by these reservations
[1929.88 --> 1959.86]  piano plays softly
[1959.88 --> 1989.86]  piano plays softly
[1989.88 --> 2019.86]  piano plays softly
[2019.88 --> 2049.86]  piano plays softly
[2049.88 --> 2079.86]  piano plays softly
[2079.86 --> 2109.84]  piano plays softly
[2109.84 --> 2139.82]  piano plays softly
[2139.82 --> 2169.80]  piano plays softly
[2169.80 --> 2199.78]  piano plays softly
[2199.78 --> 2201.78]  piano plays softly
[2201.78 --> 2231.78] 
[2231.78 --> 2233.78]  piano plays softly
[2233.78 --> 2235.78]  piano plays softly
[2235.78 --> 2265.78] 
[2265.78 --> 2267.78]  piano plays softly
[2267.78 --> 2269.78]  piano plays softly
[2269.78 --> 2299.78] 
[2299.78 --> 2329.78] 
[2329.78 --> 2331.78]  piano plays softly
[2331.78 --> 2333.78]  piano plays softly
