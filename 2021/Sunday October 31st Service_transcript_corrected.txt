[0.00 → 2.24] Good morning.
[5.18 → 11.00] It's so good to be with each of you this morning here and those of you online as well.
[13.26 → 17.60] We have been in a series for quite a few weeks now on servanthood.
[18.70 → 23.80] We've been talking about how you serve in leadership and with leadership,
[23.80 → 30.12] how you're serving with your gifts, serving with your resources, serving at your work, serving our city,
[31.00 → 33.26] in essence serving like Jesus wherever you are.
[34.48 → 40.24] And today I want to talk about a little bit of a different topic and that's serving with brokenness,
[40.54 → 42.72] which might sound kind of contradictory.
[42.86 → 48.76] Usually when we talk about serving the broken, and we have opportunities where we serve our communities
[48.76 → 52.74] and we serve those who are poor and oppressed and struggling,
[52.74 → 55.70] this is why we have the community kitchen, right?
[55.78 → 57.56] These are ways we serve the broken.
[58.22 → 64.14] Or this is why we're having an offering for the care fund because sometimes in broken times people need extra support
[64.14 → 66.52] and we want that support to be there.
[67.04 → 72.80] But today I want to focus more on how do we serve with our brokenness?
[73.82 → 79.20] Because I think sometimes there's a danger in thinking that, oh, I'm in a broken moment, I can't serve.
[79.20 → 89.02] And the answer, or what I'd like to say to that is, in some ways, you're ideally suited to serve in brokenness and with brokenness.
[89.06 → 92.54] So I'm going to hopefully walk us through that this morning here.
[94.30 → 95.84] Let's look at Galatians 6.
[96.10 → 98.92] We're going to look at the verses 1 through 5 and the verses 9 through 10.
[99.24 → 100.56] You can look at it online.
[100.72 → 103.74] It'll be up on the screen here, of course, or if you have your Bibles with you.
[103.74 → 110.18] So Galatians 6, verses 1 through 10.
[112.66 → 121.00] Brothers and sisters, Paul writes, if someone is caught in a sin, I like another translation a wee bit better where it says,
[121.36 → 122.90] overcome by sin.
[123.38 → 128.78] That feels how it goes to me at least, that you're somehow overcome by this struggle.
[129.16 → 133.28] You who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently.
[133.74 → 137.54] But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted.
[138.80 → 141.00] Carry each other's burdens.
[142.00 → 144.38] And in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
[144.66 → 148.86] If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves.
[149.50 → 151.58] Each one should test their own actions.
[152.04 → 155.98] Then they can take pride in themselves alone without comparing themselves to someone else.
[156.22 → 158.38] For each one should carry their own load.
[158.38 → 163.84] Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the Word should share all good things with their instructor.
[164.76 → 165.46] And then verse 9.
[166.10 → 168.72] Let us not become weary in doing good.
[169.06 → 172.30] For at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
[173.04 → 177.04] And therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people,
[177.14 → 180.30] especially to those who belong to the family of believers.
[180.30 → 186.10] And Paul here is talking about how we do life together.
[187.10 → 189.62] And there's one important assumption he has here.
[190.08 → 193.62] And that is this, that we are all broken.
[194.72 → 195.84] We are all broken.
[196.08 → 198.86] Scripture says, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[199.04 → 199.90] All struggle.
[200.28 → 201.40] All need grace.
[202.36 → 202.54] Right?
[202.64 → 203.76] All are broken.
[203.76 → 208.08] Therefore, because of that, bear each other's burdens.
[208.36 → 209.76] Help each other in their struggles.
[210.10 → 210.94] Notice each other.
[211.20 → 212.86] No one is burden free.
[213.54 → 216.94] And therefore, all need help in burden sharing and burden bearing.
[218.22 → 220.56] And then do this gently.
[220.76 → 224.76] And of course you do it gently because you know what it's like.
[225.36 → 229.38] You don't get to be up here looking down on this burdened person.
[229.68 → 230.60] No, you get it.
[230.60 → 232.02] You're burdened too.
[232.02 → 236.14] And we walk together in the struggles that we have.
[237.80 → 240.18] And if you don't do this gently or humbly,
[240.64 → 245.28] then you are probably in a position where you've likely forgotten what it's like to be broken.
[245.70 → 249.18] And then Paul says, you're now on the verge of a fall yourself.
[249.52 → 254.58] Be careful lest you fall, lest you get messed up in some way here.
[255.46 → 256.96] So get in there and help each other.
[256.96 → 261.70] Maybe you're thinking, well, Sid, this is all fairly obvious.
[262.44 → 264.64] And in some ways, maybe it is.
[265.10 → 267.50] But it's really hard to live it out.
[268.16 → 269.50] It's a real battle to live it out.
[270.26 → 275.16] You know, when I look around in today's world, I see so much divisiveness.
[275.34 → 276.10] Maybe you do too.
[276.52 → 278.62] Including the church sometime, and sadly so.
[278.62 → 286.66] As a pastor, I often see so many people who are unaware of burdens around them,
[287.32 → 289.46] but also burdens within them.
[290.80 → 296.46] And I think that happens because we're sometimes so busy either trying to prove ourselves right somehow.
[296.78 → 299.28] We turn everything into issues, and we battle over them.
[299.50 → 301.66] So we're going to prove ourselves right about whatever it is.
[301.66 → 307.10] Or we're busy protecting ourselves and hiding behind certain bravado.
[310.94 → 316.22] I've seen it, as I said so many times, people are oblivious to their own brokenness.
[316.42 → 320.12] But they're highly aware of the brokenness they see around them in others.
[320.88 → 324.14] And then they feel the need to attack that or challenge that or point it out.
[324.56 → 328.70] Some Christians have the uncanny ability to turn on others at the very time
[328.70 → 331.36] when support and encouragement are most needed.
[331.66 → 336.70] And sometimes this is done in the name of holiness or purity.
[336.94 → 338.06] Those are wonderful words.
[338.30 → 342.08] But sometimes we use those, we weaponize those words to attack others.
[342.66 → 345.26] And this isn't burden bearing.
[346.50 → 348.40] That's why scripture called it judgmentalism.
[349.84 → 356.04] Jesus, you know, one of my favourite pictures that he gave of this kind of idea was the logs and the specks.
[356.04 → 359.62] He said, you know, some of you are great speck finders.
[360.82 → 361.94] But you've got logs.
[362.74 → 364.32] Burdens of your own right here.
[364.44 → 365.00] And it's big.
[365.48 → 367.62] But you see all these little things all over the place.
[367.94 → 368.92] Logs and specks.
[369.24 → 370.30] And the problem is this.
[370.46 → 374.34] When we miss out on our logs, our burdens, our struggles,
[374.58 → 379.76] we become no good at helping anyone else bear their burdens.
[379.76 → 384.08] I think this is one of the reasons why AA works so well.
[385.16 → 386.22] Everyone's in the same boat.
[386.36 → 389.64] Everyone comes in knowing they're broken, they're burdened, they're struggling.
[390.06 → 393.00] And so we can share burdens, and then we can help each other.
[393.16 → 394.14] And this is how that goes.
[394.84 → 398.06] In James 5 verse 6, we read, it says,
[398.06 → 403.50] Therefore, because of this dynamic, therefore, confess your sins to each other.
[403.68 → 406.64] Right away a lot of people, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down here.
[406.74 → 407.92] Confess sins to one another.
[408.20 → 409.62] Yeah, yeah, yeah, share your burdens.
[409.82 → 411.60] Confess your sins to one another.
[411.74 → 412.04] Why?
[412.28 → 413.96] That you might be healed.
[415.00 → 418.54] The prayers of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
[418.86 → 423.62] So this process of healing happens when we share burdens, we share struggles.
[423.62 → 425.02] Not with everyone.
[426.40 → 427.22] With someone.
[428.06 → 429.88] In some kind of circle.
[430.42 → 433.46] And notice again, we are all in need of forgiveness.
[433.80 → 436.90] We are all struggling with the dynamics of sin.
[437.16 → 439.60] We all need confession somewhere.
[441.42 → 443.10] Confession is simply mutual honesty.
[444.06 → 445.10] It's an unburdening.
[446.26 → 448.94] And only then can relationships grow.
[449.20 → 451.44] And only then can we get healthier.
[452.98 → 457.04] Without humility, you cannot be a burden bearer.
[458.06 → 459.88] And you won't be aware of yours.
[459.88 → 466.08] I'm going to put two verses side by side out of the Gospel of Matthew.
[466.72 → 469.96] Where we get a description of the religious leaders.
[471.30 → 473.58] And how they were handling burdens in their day.
[473.84 → 477.22] And how Jesus, as a contrast, showed that differently.
[477.74 → 479.82] In Matthew 23, out of the New King James.
[479.82 → 481.72] This is what the religious leaders are doing.
[481.72 → 486.30] For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men's and women's shoulders.
[486.78 → 490.12] But they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
[491.56 → 491.84] Alright.
[491.84 → 493.82] That sucks.
[495.88 → 496.28] Jesus.
[497.08 → 497.64] Matthew 11.
[498.54 → 501.06] Come to me all who are weary and burdened.
[501.22 → 502.76] And I will give you rest.
[503.58 → 506.00] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me.
[506.30 → 508.22] I am gentle and humble in heart.
[508.48 → 510.32] And you will find rest for your souls.
[510.62 → 511.52] My yoke is easy.
[511.84 → 513.16] My burden is light.
[513.16 → 520.90] You see such a contrast in the way burdens are approached in these two verses.
[521.24 → 522.26] And the irony is this.
[522.52 → 525.74] The only removal of burdens comes through Jesus.
[526.76 → 528.34] But you start with yourself.
[528.52 → 530.92] And then you can jump in there with others as well.
[531.02 → 532.06] And share each other's burden.
[532.38 → 532.92] And confess.
[533.20 → 536.32] Because Jesus is the only source of burden removal for all of us.
[536.70 → 541.42] And then we're most Christ-like when we gently come alongside each other.
[541.42 → 543.96] With humility and with grace and with love.
[544.50 → 547.44] Then burdens can be shared.
[551.68 → 553.36] That's what Paul writes.
[553.46 → 555.12] He says, no comparing.
[556.22 → 558.06] It's a test yourself.
[558.86 → 559.04] Right?
[559.66 → 560.50] No comparing.
[560.78 → 563.72] How hard is that in a world that's always comparing?
[564.86 → 566.52] We're comparing how we raise our kids.
[566.60 → 567.44] We're comparing marriages.
[567.58 → 568.86] We're comparing finances.
[569.00 → 570.76] We're comparing everything.
[570.76 → 574.78] And the world around us seems to encourage that.
[575.32 → 578.32] But it doesn't allow for healthiness at all.
[578.94 → 581.02] And when you know yourself.
[582.12 → 583.50] And this is a big challenge.
[583.58 → 584.66] I'm going to have in this message for you.
[584.92 → 586.20] When you know yourself.
[586.56 → 588.02] Really, really know yourself.
[588.10 → 589.78] And don't assume that you do.
[591.12 → 594.82] It's a lot easier to be a burden sharer and bearer.
[594.82 → 596.74] Because you know you have logs.
[596.74 → 597.76] And you have specs.
[598.04 → 600.50] And you know you need grace all the time.
[600.78 → 603.64] And that you are now in a position where you get to give grace.
[603.68 → 604.88] Because you know what it's like to get it.
[605.08 → 608.66] And you know you're in no position to act like you have it all together.
[609.56 → 610.82] Because you don't.
[610.82 → 613.14] And you're in no position.
[613.14 → 613.56] And you don't need one choice.
[615.04 → 616.46] My wife Candy and I.
[617.42 → 620.54] Next month we'll be married for 45 years.
[620.54 → 628.38] you really ought to applaud her
[628.38 → 639.38] and to be honest with you
[639.38 → 641.96] sometimes I think back of that
[641.96 → 645.30] 20-year-old kid who didn't know a lot
[645.30 → 647.42] fell in love
[647.42 → 652.62] and I go like that because
[652.62 → 656.56] I've learned more about love
[656.56 → 661.64] through these 45 years and the depth of what love can look like
[661.64 → 665.26] it's so much deeper than that young guy in those early days
[665.26 → 666.62] that's all fine, that's the journey
[666.62 → 670.70] you know I think one of the things we discovered
[670.70 → 675.38] is that we were dealing with
[675.38 → 676.66] two very broken people
[676.66 → 681.36] and neither one of us
[681.36 → 684.86] have done a very good job of unpacking our brokenness yet
[684.86 → 690.12] we had a lot of learning to do about
[690.12 → 693.42] how deeply broken we were as human beings
[693.42 → 696.00] I think we also learned
[696.00 → 697.96] that we needed to share those burdens
[697.96 → 701.34] with more than just one another
[701.34 → 707.44] and you know I want to encourage those of you
[707.44 → 710.66] you know let's never hold up our marriages
[710.66 → 712.04] like
[712.04 → 715.60] like they're perfect
[715.60 → 719.64] you do a terrible disservice to others
[719.64 → 722.36] if you hold it up like that
[722.36 → 724.34] it's just it's not going to be particularly helpful
[724.34 → 726.64] that doesn't mean to say that you can't share some strength in your marriage
[726.64 → 728.48] but I think we all need to
[728.48 → 730.78] you know when I think back of
[730.78 → 732.12] you know where Kenny and I were
[732.12 → 734.42] I mean we were way too immature
[734.42 → 736.56] way too unaware
[736.56 → 739.54] way too messy to bear each other's burdens alone
[739.54 → 745.34] sometimes our burdens would smash into each other
[745.34 → 746.94] right
[746.94 → 749.30] we'd get defensive
[749.30 → 752.22] both of us over the years
[752.22 → 753.42] have sought
[753.42 → 757.40] fairly lengthy times of professional counselling
[757.40 → 759.66] in order to
[759.66 → 761.42] evaluate ourselves
[761.42 → 763.52] like Paul says there
[763.52 → 765.72] in order to know ourselves
[765.72 → 769.14] understand our brokenness
[769.14 → 770.40] so that we could help
[770.40 → 772.36] bear one another's burdens
[772.36 → 776.82] that's a lot of hard work
[776.82 → 780.18] the truth is this
[780.18 → 782.68] you can't help
[782.68 → 785.36] bear unshared burdens
[785.36 → 789.48] and you can't share
[789.48 → 791.46] burdens you're unaware of
[791.46 → 797.36] and maybe your first
[797.36 → 799.14] big step of service
[799.14 → 799.80] in all of this
[799.80 → 802.62] is discovering how you are broken
[802.62 → 804.22] and how deep that goes
[804.22 → 805.72] and how messy that goes
[805.72 → 807.18] so that you know
[807.18 → 808.80] so that you can share it
[808.80 → 810.56] so that you can confess it
[810.56 → 812.28] so that you can be healed
[812.28 → 814.68] so that you can help be a healer
[814.68 → 816.80] in your marriage
[816.80 → 819.22] and maybe in some other marriages
[819.22 → 823.94] this isn't an easy step
[823.94 → 828.08] and this is a lifelong process
[828.08 → 830.68] till death do you part
[830.68 → 834.96] but if you don't do this
[834.96 → 837.06] you'll miss the logs
[837.06 → 838.68] that are right in front of your face
[838.68 → 839.62] that you're not seeing
[839.62 → 841.18] and you'll stay immature
[841.18 → 843.24] and you won't grow
[843.24 → 845.08] individually or as a couple
[845.08 → 847.26] and you'll compare a lot
[847.26 → 848.40] and you'll attack
[848.40 → 849.24] instead of encourage
[849.24 → 850.82] and you'll remain a victim
[850.82 → 851.94] of your own brokenness
[851.94 → 853.36] and you'll add burdens
[853.36 → 854.46] instead of relieve them
[854.46 → 856.26] and you'll increase the mess
[856.26 → 862.26] how do you confess
[862.26 → 864.02] what you hardly know
[864.02 → 870.96] and sometimes it's hard
[870.96 → 874.78] maybe you haven't figured out
[874.78 → 877.84] how your past has messed with you
[877.84 → 880.38] maybe you grew up
[880.38 → 881.72] in a real dysfunctional family
[881.72 → 884.14] and that dysfunction
[884.14 → 886.28] actually is more entrenched in you
[886.28 → 887.04] than you realize
[887.04 → 889.22] and you've got some real digging to do
[889.22 → 891.92] I mean this is hard work
[891.92 → 894.50] and I love how blunt Paul is
[894.50 → 896.70] he says if anyone thinks he is something
[896.70 → 897.44] when they aren't
[897.44 → 898.64] well they lie to themselves
[898.64 → 898.94] right
[898.94 → 901.16] so if you think you've got your stuff together
[901.16 → 902.14] and you're something
[902.14 → 903.52] well settle down
[903.52 → 904.24] you're not
[904.24 → 907.36] quit deluding yourself
[907.36 → 908.98] you're broken
[908.98 → 911.10] so is your brother and sister
[911.10 → 911.90] so is your spouse
[911.90 → 912.60] so are your friends
[912.60 → 913.40] so are your co-workers
[913.40 → 914.76] so are your pastors
[914.76 → 916.34] so are your kids
[916.34 → 919.12] and once you get that straight
[919.12 → 919.98] then you're in a position
[919.98 → 921.00] to share your burdens
[921.00 → 922.04] and to try to help bear
[922.04 → 922.82] the burdens of others
[922.82 → 923.52] and then
[923.52 → 925.20] like Paul says in verse 1
[925.20 → 925.62] right
[925.62 → 926.34] he says that
[926.34 → 927.64] someone who's caught in this
[927.64 → 928.54] in this sin
[928.54 → 929.86] that someone who is
[929.86 → 931.72] who lives by the spirit
[931.72 → 933.32] should restore that person gently
[933.32 → 935.16] so someone who lives by the spirit
[935.16 → 936.82] what does that even mean
[936.82 → 938.12] right
[938.12 → 939.40] I think the spirit
[939.40 → 942.08] helps reveal to you and I
[942.08 → 943.80] who we really are
[943.80 → 946.18] and where we really need to grow
[946.18 → 948.04] then that person
[948.04 → 949.32] kind of gets it
[949.32 → 950.60] and that person
[950.60 → 951.88] then is in a position
[951.88 → 954.32] to be helpful
[954.32 → 956.76] and humble
[956.76 → 960.72] and then restoration
[960.72 → 962.06] can take place
[962.06 → 962.86] with gentleness
[962.86 → 964.32] knowing yourself
[964.32 → 966.60] it'll keep you from being a jerk
[966.60 → 969.78] it'll keep you from being judgmental
[969.78 → 971.96] and it'll keep you from being blind
[971.96 → 972.50] to the idea
[972.50 → 974.02] that you too might have logs
[974.02 → 976.16] but notice the idea
[976.16 → 977.40] is restoration
[977.40 → 980.10] this isn't just discovery
[980.10 → 981.72] this is about restoration
[981.72 → 984.02] and you know that freedom lies
[984.02 → 985.04] in Christ alone
[985.04 → 986.36] so don't get me wrong
[986.36 → 986.90] in all this
[986.90 → 988.68] we aren't turning a blind eye
[988.68 → 989.96] toward our brokenness
[989.96 → 990.96] or anyone else's
[990.96 → 991.52] for that matter
[991.52 → 992.44] that's why Paul says
[992.44 → 993.42] evaluate yourself
[993.42 → 994.10] and confess
[994.10 → 994.78] and share
[994.78 → 995.34] and name it
[995.34 → 995.66] and know it
[995.66 → 996.84] because it's harming
[996.84 → 997.84] all of us
[997.84 → 1003.86] I think of Paul
[1003.86 → 1006.60] writing to the Corinthians
[1006.60 → 1007.68] at one time
[1007.68 → 1008.98] and there's about this man
[1008.98 → 1010.30] and this man
[1010.30 → 1013.42] was living with his father's wife
[1013.42 → 1015.38] in a sexual relationship
[1015.38 → 1018.10] and nothing was being said
[1018.10 → 1018.60] about it
[1018.60 → 1021.74] and then restoration
[1021.74 → 1023.40] looked a little different here
[1023.40 → 1023.94] you know
[1023.94 → 1025.10] Paul says about gentle
[1025.10 → 1027.10] well this wasn't quite as gentle
[1027.10 → 1027.78] in fact
[1027.78 → 1028.44] and the church
[1028.44 → 1029.06] was not
[1029.06 → 1030.60] the pagans around
[1030.60 → 1031.96] were horrified by this
[1031.96 → 1032.80] but the church
[1032.80 → 1033.90] seemed to be kind of okay
[1033.90 → 1035.20] like they were tolerating this
[1035.20 → 1036.18] in some kind of beautiful way
[1036.18 → 1036.94] and it wasn't beautiful
[1036.94 → 1038.02] in any way shape or form
[1038.02 → 1039.84] and restoring this man
[1039.84 → 1042.04] involved removing this man
[1042.04 → 1046.86] because he wasn't changing
[1046.86 → 1047.84] and he didn't care
[1047.84 → 1049.88] and he was harming the church
[1049.88 → 1053.18] I think of Jesus
[1053.18 → 1053.68] and the woman
[1053.68 → 1054.46] caught in adultery
[1054.46 → 1055.52] I'm trying to reflect
[1055.52 → 1056.44] on restoration
[1056.44 → 1057.36] what does it look like
[1057.36 → 1058.66] and yes gentle of course
[1058.66 → 1059.94] but Jesus
[1059.94 → 1060.34] and the woman
[1060.34 → 1061.16] caught in adultery
[1061.16 → 1061.40] right
[1061.40 → 1062.02] and she's tossed
[1062.02 → 1062.68] in front of Jesus
[1062.68 → 1063.66] and the guy's saying
[1063.66 → 1064.36] we're going to stone her
[1064.36 → 1065.02] what do you think Jesus
[1065.02 → 1065.70] and Jesus says
[1065.70 → 1066.24] yeah no, no
[1066.24 → 1067.18] the stoning idea
[1067.18 → 1067.84] sure
[1067.84 → 1069.24] the one without sin
[1069.24 → 1070.30] you know you go first
[1070.30 → 1072.02] and of course
[1072.02 → 1073.14] no one can throw a stone
[1073.14 → 1075.30] because their self-righteousness
[1075.30 → 1076.12] was then exposed
[1076.12 → 1077.54] and their lack of love
[1077.54 → 1078.22] was exposed
[1078.22 → 1079.80] and then Jesus says
[1079.80 → 1080.56] to the woman right
[1080.56 → 1082.34] I don't condemn you
[1082.34 → 1083.40] you see the gentleness
[1083.40 → 1085.22] I don't condemn you
[1085.22 → 1088.00] I'm here to bring you
[1088.00 → 1089.22] restoration and healing
[1089.22 → 1090.64] and then he does say
[1090.64 → 1091.52] therefore
[1091.52 → 1092.82] and here's the restoration
[1092.82 → 1094.76] go sin no more
[1094.76 → 1099.72] change
[1099.72 → 1103.02] he's telling this woman
[1103.02 → 1104.58] know yourself
[1104.58 → 1106.00] how'd you get here
[1106.00 → 1108.06] and there's probably
[1108.06 → 1108.62] a lot of reasons
[1108.62 → 1109.62] I'm not trying to figure
[1109.62 → 1110.06] that out
[1110.06 → 1111.82] but this is harming you
[1111.82 → 1112.92] and this is harming
[1112.92 → 1113.94] those you love
[1113.94 → 1115.84] this is harming
[1115.84 → 1116.32] those you love
[1116.32 → 1117.70] this adultery
[1117.70 → 1118.64] is harming everyone
[1118.64 → 1119.40] including yourself
[1119.40 → 1121.18] and I would love to hear
[1121.18 → 1122.48] her ongoing story
[1122.48 → 1122.72] right
[1122.72 → 1124.44] did Jesus now open her eyes
[1124.44 → 1125.36] up to an opportunity
[1125.36 → 1126.16] to see herself
[1126.16 → 1127.08] to see her brokenness
[1127.08 → 1128.04] to see her need
[1128.04 → 1129.18] her need for healing
[1129.18 → 1129.84] and for grace
[1129.84 → 1131.50] did this lead to wholeness
[1131.50 → 1132.98] in her marriage
[1132.98 → 1133.78] and in her life
[1133.78 → 1134.34] because that was the
[1134.34 → 1135.26] opportunity for sure
[1135.26 → 1136.36] to confession
[1136.36 → 1137.58] and awareness
[1137.58 → 1138.90] and healing
[1138.90 → 1145.32] recently I was reading
[1145.32 → 1147.32] out of a magazine
[1147.32 → 1148.42] called Christianity Today
[1148.42 → 1150.08] and I was reading
[1150.08 → 1151.10] about a Presbyterian
[1151.10 → 1152.10] pastor and professor
[1152.10 → 1153.94] from Columbia Bible College
[1153.94 → 1155.12] a guy by name
[1155.12 → 1156.36] Buck Hatch
[1156.36 → 1160.08] and I'd never heard of him
[1160.08 → 1160.92] and I thought
[1160.92 → 1161.90] I'm kind of curious
[1161.90 → 1163.34] who this guy is
[1163.34 → 1166.72] and he was a professor
[1166.72 → 1167.92] at Columbia Bible College
[1167.92 → 1168.42] he was a pastor
[1168.42 → 1168.90] for many years
[1168.90 → 1169.38] as I said
[1169.38 → 1170.44] and he was a real
[1170.44 → 1171.64] sought after counsellor
[1171.64 → 1173.04] particularly for young people
[1173.04 → 1174.98] and the article
[1174.98 → 1175.86] was written by his son
[1175.86 → 1177.16] the article talked about
[1177.16 → 1178.80] the scars of terrible
[1178.80 → 1180.10] dysfunction in his family
[1180.10 → 1181.68] when he grew up
[1181.68 → 1183.70] the one story where
[1183.70 → 1185.12] he describes
[1185.12 → 1187.10] Buck sitting at the top
[1187.10 → 1187.56] of the stairs
[1187.56 → 1188.10] in his house
[1188.10 → 1189.58] listening downstairs
[1189.58 → 1190.48] to his parents
[1190.48 → 1191.62] and waiting
[1191.62 → 1192.62] and trying to find
[1192.62 → 1194.96] them share one kind
[1194.96 → 1196.38] word between each other
[1196.38 → 1197.24] and he'd sit there
[1197.24 → 1197.64] every night
[1197.64 → 1198.22] listen for that
[1198.22 → 1199.36] one kind word
[1199.36 → 1200.20] and he went to bed
[1200.20 → 1201.10] disappointed every night
[1201.10 → 1205.30] and he grew up
[1205.30 → 1205.80] insecure
[1205.80 → 1207.02] and melancholy
[1207.02 → 1207.60] and introverted
[1207.60 → 1209.54] and his son said this
[1209.54 → 1210.86] yet he never
[1210.86 → 1212.22] fled his brokenness
[1212.22 → 1214.24] he never fled
[1214.24 → 1214.88] his brokenness
[1214.88 → 1216.30] and there's a lot
[1216.30 → 1217.26] of ways to flee
[1217.26 → 1218.14] your brokenness
[1218.14 → 1219.98] there's going to be
[1219.98 → 1220.64] something in you
[1220.64 → 1221.52] that pushes you
[1221.52 → 1222.34] to run from
[1222.34 → 1223.00] your brokenness
[1223.00 → 1224.28] to hide from it
[1224.28 → 1224.72] somehow
[1224.72 → 1226.24] that's just
[1226.24 → 1227.32] that's just
[1227.32 → 1228.34] going to be automatic
[1228.34 → 1230.06] and it's going to
[1230.06 → 1230.86] take great courage
[1230.86 → 1231.60] to lean into
[1231.60 → 1232.44] your brokenness
[1232.44 → 1234.04] some people
[1234.04 → 1234.62] hide
[1234.62 → 1234.98] you know
[1234.98 → 1235.64] he had brothers
[1235.64 → 1236.08] and sisters
[1236.08 → 1237.06] and they turned out
[1237.06 → 1237.84] to be fairly successful
[1237.84 → 1238.40] in some ways
[1238.40 → 1238.70] and yet
[1238.70 → 1239.62] all of them
[1239.62 → 1240.16] ended up
[1240.16 → 1240.98] broken marriages
[1240.98 → 1241.74] alcoholism
[1241.74 → 1242.46] all kinds of things
[1242.46 → 1242.90] like that
[1242.90 → 1244.32] because they weren't
[1244.32 → 1245.84] leaning into
[1245.84 → 1246.28] the brokenness
[1246.28 → 1252.82] and the son writes
[1252.82 → 1254.24] dad's brokenness
[1254.24 → 1255.62] not his strength
[1255.62 → 1257.22] gave him ready access
[1257.22 → 1258.76] into the interior rooms
[1258.76 → 1259.62] of people's lives
[1259.62 → 1261.00] when people confess
[1261.00 → 1261.46] to him
[1261.46 → 1262.60] their dark nights
[1262.60 → 1263.26] of the soul
[1263.26 → 1264.06] they don't get
[1264.06 → 1264.96] pat solutions
[1264.96 → 1266.14] but an embrace
[1266.14 → 1266.76] from one
[1266.76 → 1267.96] who has also
[1267.96 → 1269.68] traversed the darkness
[1269.68 → 1274.44] isn't that what you want
[1274.44 → 1275.06] in your brokenness
[1275.06 → 1281.18] he served
[1281.18 → 1282.46] this is
[1282.46 → 1283.40] what I'm preaching
[1283.40 → 1284.72] he served
[1284.72 → 1286.60] with his brokenness
[1286.60 → 1289.04] he knew it
[1289.04 → 1289.72] deeply
[1289.72 → 1292.18] and it allowed him
[1292.18 → 1293.22] to enter the darkness
[1293.22 → 1294.02] of others
[1294.02 → 1295.36] that's
[1295.36 → 1296.24] burden bearing
[1296.24 → 1297.94] built on an awareness
[1297.94 → 1299.10] of one's own
[1299.10 → 1299.78] burdens
[1299.78 → 1302.00] he didn't expect
[1302.00 → 1302.74] quick and easy
[1302.74 → 1303.82] spiritual solutions
[1303.82 → 1304.38] to problems
[1304.38 → 1304.72] faced
[1304.72 → 1305.66] by Christians
[1305.66 → 1306.24] who had been
[1306.24 → 1306.76] denied
[1306.76 → 1307.46] healthy
[1307.46 → 1307.84] intimate
[1307.84 → 1308.52] relationships
[1308.52 → 1308.90] in their
[1308.90 → 1309.62] formative years
[1309.62 → 1310.76] that was a
[1310.76 → 1311.70] long journey
[1311.70 → 1315.12] that is
[1315.12 → 1315.90] a long
[1315.90 → 1316.48] journey
[1316.48 → 1317.78] but you need
[1317.78 → 1318.44] to know
[1318.44 → 1319.48] how you've been
[1319.48 → 1320.50] messed up
[1320.50 → 1323.86] and how it's
[1323.86 → 1325.16] distorting you
[1325.16 → 1326.86] in your present
[1326.86 → 1327.52] relationship
[1327.52 → 1328.42] so that you
[1328.42 → 1329.26] when you unpack
[1329.26 → 1330.26] that you understand
[1330.26 → 1330.64] it
[1330.64 → 1331.80] and then you can be
[1331.80 → 1332.36] of good
[1332.36 → 1333.82] in relationships
[1333.82 → 1337.74] effective
[1337.74 → 1338.30] counselling
[1338.30 → 1339.64] as Buck said
[1339.64 → 1340.80] as he saw it
[1340.80 → 1341.50] allowed people
[1341.50 → 1342.52] to get beyond
[1342.52 → 1342.98] themselves
[1342.98 → 1343.64] I like that
[1343.64 → 1344.84] counselling is about
[1344.84 → 1345.52] getting beyond
[1345.52 → 1346.30] yourself
[1346.30 → 1347.62] when you are
[1347.62 → 1348.52] broken and messy
[1348.52 → 1349.88] you will get stuck
[1349.88 → 1350.36] in your own
[1350.36 → 1351.12] self-centredness
[1351.12 → 1353.66] the healthier
[1353.66 → 1354.28] you get
[1354.28 → 1355.24] the less time
[1355.24 → 1355.82] you spend
[1355.82 → 1356.36] worrying all
[1356.36 → 1356.90] about you
[1356.90 → 1359.16] the more
[1359.16 → 1359.88] broken you are
[1359.88 → 1360.22] the more
[1360.22 → 1360.86] focused you
[1360.86 → 1361.20] will be on
[1361.20 → 1361.60] yourself
[1361.60 → 1362.46] because there's
[1362.46 → 1362.76] so much
[1362.76 → 1363.20] damage
[1363.20 → 1366.74] and he
[1366.74 → 1368.02] he wanted to
[1368.02 → 1368.58] help prepare
[1368.58 → 1369.02] people
[1369.02 → 1369.54] with an
[1369.54 → 1370.10] encounter
[1370.10 → 1370.76] of the
[1370.76 → 1371.36] matchless
[1371.36 → 1371.86] grace
[1371.86 → 1372.50] of God
[1372.50 → 1373.16] the only
[1373.16 → 1373.60] enduring
[1373.60 → 1374.46] reason
[1374.46 → 1375.04] for living
[1375.04 → 1375.62] in wholeness
[1375.62 → 1376.94] so restoration
[1376.94 → 1377.86] healing
[1377.86 → 1378.72] bearing each
[1378.72 → 1379.04] other's
[1379.04 → 1379.34] burdens
[1379.34 → 1380.18] knowing our
[1380.18 → 1380.44] burdens
[1380.44 → 1381.38] this is the
[1381.38 → 1381.96] journey we
[1381.96 → 1382.28] are on
[1382.28 → 1382.66] together
[1382.66 → 1384.24] we see
[1384.24 → 1384.90] each other
[1384.90 → 1385.72] with our
[1385.72 → 1386.10] burden
[1386.10 → 1386.48] bearing
[1386.48 → 1387.24] with our
[1387.24 → 1388.06] we serve
[1388.06 → 1388.40] each other
[1388.40 → 1388.96] with our
[1388.96 → 1389.28] burden
[1389.28 → 1389.62] bearing
[1389.62 → 1390.26] with our
[1390.26 → 1390.78] awareness
[1390.78 → 1391.16] and our
[1391.16 → 1391.56] honesty
[1391.56 → 1391.90] with our
[1391.90 → 1392.44] confessions
[1392.44 → 1392.84] with our
[1392.84 → 1393.24] gentleness
[1393.24 → 1394.34] on paths
[1394.34 → 1394.82] toward
[1394.82 → 1395.44] restoration
[1395.44 → 1399.28] and we
[1399.28 → 1399.60] do this
[1399.60 → 1400.00] together
[1400.00 → 1401.88] because it's
[1401.88 → 1402.26] a together
[1402.26 → 1402.84] project
[1402.84 → 1403.36] you can't
[1403.36 → 1403.52] do it
[1403.52 → 1403.78] alone
[1403.78 → 1405.28] and we're
[1405.28 → 1405.66] all in need
[1405.66 → 1406.10] of healing
[1406.10 → 1406.68] and grace
[1406.68 → 1407.72] and growing
[1407.72 → 1408.14] awareness
[1408.14 → 1408.92] this is why
[1408.92 → 1409.14] we have
[1409.14 → 1409.74] small groups
[1409.74 → 1411.40] you know
[1411.40 → 1411.80] not every
[1411.80 → 1412.34] small group
[1412.34 → 1412.72] is necessarily
[1412.72 → 1413.02] going to
[1413.02 → 1413.98] dive way
[1413.98 → 1414.26] deep
[1414.26 → 1414.58] but maybe
[1414.58 → 1414.98] over time
[1414.98 → 1415.28] it will
[1415.28 → 1416.46] this is why
[1416.46 → 1416.76] we all
[1416.76 → 1417.44] need somebody
[1417.44 → 1417.78] in our
[1417.78 → 1418.06] lives
[1418.06 → 1418.64] somebody
[1418.64 → 1421.10] who knows
[1421.10 → 1421.84] our story
[1421.84 → 1425.26] somebody
[1425.26 → 1425.50] who might
[1425.50 → 1425.86] hold us
[1425.86 → 1426.30] accountable
[1426.30 → 1430.56] no one
[1430.56 → 1431.26] has arrived
[1431.26 → 1431.98] at perfection
[1431.98 → 1432.58] except through
[1432.58 → 1433.34] Christ's grace
[1433.34 → 1433.94] and power
[1433.94 → 1435.58] you are
[1435.58 → 1435.96] perfect
[1435.96 → 1436.56] I'm perfect
[1436.56 → 1436.88] why
[1436.88 → 1437.54] thank you
[1437.54 → 1437.82] Jesus
[1437.82 → 1441.62] this is
[1441.62 → 1442.34] the journey
[1442.34 → 1442.68] we're on
[1442.68 → 1442.98] together
[1442.98 → 1444.34] this is how
[1444.34 → 1444.68] we serve
[1444.68 → 1445.12] each other
[1445.12 → 1447.20] the spiritual
[1447.20 → 1447.56] believer
[1447.56 → 1448.32] doesn't have
[1448.32 → 1448.54] it all
[1448.54 → 1448.82] together
[1448.82 → 1449.12] but no
[1449.12 → 1449.44] Jesus
[1449.44 → 1449.78] does
[1449.78 → 1450.50] and he's
[1450.50 → 1450.96] motivated
[1450.96 → 1451.60] by God's
[1451.60 → 1451.84] word
[1451.84 → 1452.36] and the
[1452.36 → 1452.68] power of
[1452.68 → 1453.04] the spirit
[1453.04 → 1453.60] his love
[1453.60 → 1454.44] which we
[1454.44 → 1455.06] receive
[1455.06 → 1455.62] and then we
[1455.62 → 1456.10] reflect
[1456.10 → 1458.30] it's dependent
[1458.30 → 1459.42] on God
[1459.42 → 1460.24] and his
[1460.24 → 1460.68] word
[1460.68 → 1461.90] please watch
[1461.90 → 1463.08] fight against
[1463.08 → 1463.92] just having
[1463.92 → 1464.60] an opinion
[1464.60 → 1466.70] inform your
[1466.70 → 1467.38] opinion with
[1467.38 → 1468.02] God's word
[1468.02 → 1468.96] so you have
[1468.96 → 1469.52] something worth
[1469.52 → 1469.94] sharing
[1469.94 → 1471.94] love
[1471.94 → 1474.30] and David
[1474.30 → 1474.64] Banner
[1474.64 → 1475.62] let me read
[1475.62 → 1476.86] you a quote
[1476.86 → 1477.28] you'll see it
[1477.28 → 1477.54] up on the
[1477.54 → 1478.12] screen as well
[1478.12 → 1478.88] David Banner
[1478.88 → 1479.22] wrote a book
[1479.22 → 1479.74] called Surrender
[1479.74 → 1480.14] to Love
[1480.14 → 1480.60] and I love
[1480.60 → 1480.98] what he said
[1480.98 → 1481.46] about this
[1481.46 → 1482.80] so listen
[1482.80 → 1483.10] to this
[1483.10 → 1484.74] love is
[1484.74 → 1485.76] transformational
[1485.76 → 1486.50] only when it
[1486.50 → 1487.32] is received
[1487.32 → 1488.44] in vulnerability
[1488.44 → 1490.10] genuine
[1490.10 → 1491.22] transformation
[1491.22 → 1492.10] requires
[1492.10 → 1492.98] vulnerability
[1492.98 → 1493.66] which to me
[1493.66 → 1494.06] is mutual
[1494.06 → 1494.44] honesty
[1494.44 → 1495.86] it is not
[1495.86 → 1496.32] the fact
[1496.32 → 1496.60] of being
[1496.60 → 1497.68] loved unconditionally
[1497.68 → 1498.36] that is life
[1498.36 → 1498.80] changing
[1498.80 → 1499.72] it is the
[1499.72 → 1500.88] risky experience
[1500.88 → 1502.00] of allowing
[1502.00 → 1502.86] myself to be
[1502.86 → 1503.34] loved
[1503.34 → 1504.32] unconditionally
[1504.32 → 1506.50] I've seen
[1506.50 → 1507.20] people who
[1507.20 → 1507.74] can say
[1507.74 → 1508.14] oh yeah
[1508.14 → 1508.52] we have to
[1508.52 → 1509.16] love unconditionally
[1509.16 → 1509.74] but they
[1509.74 → 1509.94] don't know
[1509.94 → 1510.10] how to
[1510.10 → 1510.70] receive that
[1510.70 → 1512.08] they're going
[1512.08 → 1512.42] to earn it
[1512.42 → 1512.82] somehow
[1512.82 → 1513.42] they're going
[1513.42 → 1513.76] to figure it
[1513.76 → 1514.22] out somehow
[1514.22 → 1515.46] to be loved
[1515.46 → 1515.88] unconditionally
[1515.88 → 1516.36] is a hard
[1516.36 → 1516.94] thing here
[1516.94 → 1519.42] self-deceptions
[1519.42 → 1520.46] and an absence
[1520.46 → 1520.90] of real
[1520.90 → 1521.38] vulnerability
[1521.38 → 1522.14] block any
[1522.14 → 1522.68] measure
[1522.68 → 1523.86] meaningful
[1523.86 → 1524.60] transformation
[1524.60 → 1525.68] only when I
[1525.68 → 1526.54] accept who I
[1526.54 → 1526.86] am
[1526.86 → 1527.78] that I dare
[1527.78 → 1528.44] show you
[1528.44 → 1529.26] that self
[1529.26 → 1529.68] and all
[1529.68 → 1530.30] its vulnerability
[1530.30 → 1531.00] and nakedness
[1531.00 → 1531.82] only then
[1531.82 → 1532.20] do I have
[1532.20 → 1532.82] the opportunity
[1532.82 → 1533.50] to receive
[1533.50 → 1533.96] your love
[1533.96 → 1534.62] in a manner
[1534.62 → 1535.06] that makes
[1535.06 → 1535.76] a genuine
[1535.76 → 1537.28] difference
[1537.28 → 1540.86] my wife
[1540.86 → 1541.48] knows
[1541.48 → 1542.68] Sid
[1542.68 → 1544.58] the good
[1544.58 → 1545.80] the bad
[1545.80 → 1546.64] and the ugly
[1546.64 → 1550.36] she wants
[1550.36 → 1550.66] me
[1550.66 → 1557.52] and that's
[1557.52 → 1557.80] how God
[1557.80 → 1558.36] loves us
[1558.36 → 1564.26] how are you
[1564.26 → 1564.86] loved when
[1564.86 → 1565.26] you're not
[1565.26 → 1565.68] known
[1565.68 → 1573.86] do people
[1573.86 → 1575.16] who love you
[1575.16 → 1575.60] know the
[1575.60 → 1576.10] worst
[1576.10 → 1577.10] I'm not saying
[1577.10 → 1577.52] everybody
[1577.52 → 1578.08] somebody
[1578.08 → 1579.56] know the
[1579.56 → 1580.26] worst about
[1580.26 → 1580.44] you
[1580.44 → 1580.80] do you
[1580.80 → 1582.00] dare talk
[1582.00 → 1582.50] about the
[1582.50 → 1582.94] worst
[1582.94 → 1583.58] of yourself
[1583.58 → 1587.72] and then
[1587.72 → 1588.22] still
[1588.22 → 1590.42] know you're
[1590.42 → 1590.74] loved
[1590.74 → 1594.88] that's how
[1594.88 → 1595.30] God loves
[1595.30 → 1596.48] you
[1596.48 → 1600.26] 20
[1601.30 → 1601.96] He
[1601.96 → 1602.50] effectiveness
[1602.50 → 1603.00] many
[1603.00 → 1603.38] years
[1603.38 → 1605.52] got to
[1605.52 → 1612.98] he
[1612.98 → 1613.72] made a
[1613.72 → 1614.52] promise
[1614.52 → 1615.64] of think of and
[1615.64 → 1621.62] clever manoeuvres, all these tricky little bits of thinking we do to try to make sure
[1621.62 → 1625.78] no one understands who we are, or we've got it all figured out.
[1625.78 → 1629.88] And it's all smoke and mirrors.
[1633.72 → 1634.80] Here's where we often are.
[1634.86 → 1635.62] Banner wrote it this way.
[1635.70 → 1640.10] He said, everything within me wants to show my best pretend self to other people and to
[1640.10 → 1640.42] God.
[1640.88 → 1644.54] And this self can never be transformed.
[1645.64 → 1647.22] There's no unburdening there.
[1650.60 → 1652.88] I love how Paul described what we're after.
[1654.00 → 1656.42] I'm going to read a passage out of Ephesians here.
[1658.24 → 1660.76] Ephesians 3, Paul writes, this is what we're after.
[1661.82 → 1666.60] Paul says, I pray out of his glorious riches that he, God, may strengthen you with power
[1666.60 → 1671.06] through his spirit in your inner being, in the depth of you, so that Christ may dwell
[1671.06 → 1672.54] in your heart through faith.
[1672.54 → 1679.30] And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, you're rooted in love, may have power
[1679.30 → 1679.54] together.
[1681.16 → 1681.96] Not you by yourself.
[1682.24 → 1685.80] Together with all the Lord's holy people to grasp, and here's the lifelong process.
[1686.04 → 1686.82] We're going to grasp this.
[1687.02 → 1690.96] To grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ.
[1691.18 → 1693.54] And to know this love that surpasses knowledge.
[1694.28 → 1695.68] I don't know about how smart you are.
[1695.92 → 1699.12] That you may be filled to the measure of the fullness of God.
[1699.12 → 1699.66] I imagine that.
[1699.94 → 1704.30] Now to him is able to do miserably more than we can ask or imagine, according to his power
[1704.30 → 1705.24] that is worked within us.
[1705.48 → 1709.82] To him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus through all the generations forever and
[1709.82 → 1709.98] ever.
[1710.12 → 1710.20] Amen.
[1710.74 → 1711.74] That's what we're after.
[1711.74 → 1720.52] And yet we run into brokenness.
[1723.44 → 1728.34] Paul writes in 2 Corinthians, you know, Paul was wrestling with his own brokenness and we
[1728.34 → 1731.30] don't even know exactly what it was, but he prayed, God, take this brokenness away from
[1731.30 → 1731.46] me.
[1731.78 → 1734.18] And then this line out of 2 Corinthians.
[1734.18 → 1739.00] But he said to me, Jesus said to Paul, my grace is sufficient for you.
[1739.10 → 1741.52] My power is made perfect in weakness.
[1742.26 → 1745.72] Therefore, I will both all the more gladly about my weakness so that Christ's power may
[1745.72 → 1746.30] rest on me.
[1746.60 → 1749.90] That is why for Christ's sake, I delight in weakness because I'm aware of it.
[1750.66 → 1752.90] In insults and hardships and persecution and difficulties.
[1753.20 → 1754.76] For when I am weak, then I am strong.
[1754.98 → 1758.18] In fact, I'm strong then because I'm out of the way.
[1758.18 → 1758.28] Okay.
[1758.28 → 1758.32] Okay.
[1764.18 → 1771.12] In his book, there's a book called Art and Faith, and it's written by this Japanese artist
[1771.12 → 1773.40] named Machado Fujiwara.
[1774.00 → 1778.96] And he describes this centuries old Japanese art form known as Katsuki.
[1780.02 → 1783.14] And yeah, that's an example of this art form.
[1783.74 → 1785.48] This is when there's a ceramic bowl.
[1786.20 → 1787.62] It's broken in pieces.
[1788.12 → 1790.72] Then it's joined back together again, and it's remade.
[1790.72 → 1792.88] But not quite as it was before.
[1792.88 → 1799.12] Gleaming gold, real gleaming gold is set into the seams between the shards, making a more
[1799.12 → 1801.26] unique, more complex, more beautiful piece.
[1801.72 → 1807.62] And I want you to keep this picture in mind as you explore and examine and unearth your
[1807.62 → 1808.30] brokenness.
[1810.80 → 1812.50] Paul writes in 2 Corinthians.
[1813.30 → 1814.86] He writes in 2 Corinthians 4.7.
[1814.92 → 1816.82] He says, we have this treasure, life.
[1817.60 → 1819.90] In jars of clay, fragile.
[1821.28 → 1822.12] Breaks easily.
[1822.12 → 1823.42] In jars of clay.
[1823.66 → 1823.80] Why?
[1824.06 → 1828.00] To show that all surpassing power is from God and not from us.
[1828.58 → 1830.18] We are those bowls.
[1831.82 → 1836.66] And beautiful things will happen when we somehow unburdened, know our burdens, share our burdens,
[1836.94 → 1838.22] help each other with each other's burdens.
[1838.50 → 1843.58] We will be the gold between through the work of the Holy Spirit.
[1843.58 → 1851.30] And then as Scripture says, we will find beauty out of ashes.
[1853.36 → 1855.06] Beauty out of brokenness.
[1856.12 → 1860.68] And then, then you are in a position to serve the world.
[1860.68 → 1862.52] Let's pray.
[1862.52 → 1862.54] Let's pray.
[1869.14 → 1870.70] Lord God, we come before you.
[1873.80 → 1879.94] Lord, I thank you that you will work with us in our brokenness.
[1879.94 → 1885.60] Lord Jesus, that you came and overcame, came and overcame all the brokenness through your
[1885.60 → 1886.36] death and resurrection.
[1887.02 → 1888.46] That we may hold on to that.
[1889.18 → 1893.92] But that we would realize the ongoing work of reconciliation, of healing.
[1893.92 → 1899.02] And that we might know ourselves deeper and deeper and deeper and see that grace goes
[1899.02 → 1901.96] deeper and deeper and deeper as we explore our own brokenness.
[1902.78 → 1906.88] And when we understand our brokenness, that we might be a people then who know how to help
[1906.88 → 1908.76] with brokenness because we get it.
[1909.84 → 1912.32] And we stay gentle, but we work toward restoration.
[1912.52 → 1915.82] Restoration in ourselves and restoration for those around us.
[1916.84 → 1918.60] Lord, I pray you bless every person here.
[1918.60 → 1923.58] Father, that they may know you deeply and know themselves deeply and know your healing
[1923.58 → 1924.24] and your goodness.
[1924.40 → 1925.64] In Jesus' name, amen.
