[0.00 --> 20.56]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[21.28 --> 24.24]  It is good to gather around the Scriptures again this morning.
[25.06 --> 26.46]  And before we open the Word,
[26.52 --> 29.22]  I just want to share a word of gratitude to you for last week.
[29.22 --> 33.36]  It is no secret that we had some significant technical challenges,
[34.04 --> 36.38]  and I got some creative texts after the service saying,
[36.50 --> 40.22]  hey, it sounded like the audio was underwater,
[40.40 --> 42.78]  or it looked like it was filmed on a flip phone.
[42.90 --> 45.32]  Or someone said to me, it sounded like a tape,
[45.62 --> 46.68]  you know those old tapes,
[47.04 --> 49.18]  right before it was going to get destroyed by the tape player.
[49.38 --> 51.68]  So thank you for being patient and sticking it out.
[52.08 --> 55.60]  I was surprised to see that our live stream views were much higher.
[55.76 --> 57.56]  It was almost like you had a morbid curiosity
[57.56 --> 59.56]  to see where this was going to go last week.
[60.12 --> 63.12]  But I want to also more seriously take a moment to thank our media people.
[63.24 --> 64.08]  I see them right now.
[64.34 --> 65.74]  They do so much work behind the scenes.
[65.88 --> 66.04]  Yes.
[68.72 --> 70.86]  They do a huge amount of work behind the scenes
[70.86 --> 72.72]  to make it so that we can worship from our homes.
[73.04 --> 73.98]  And we're so grateful.
[74.08 --> 76.42]  And often we only notice them when something goes wrong,
[76.48 --> 78.28]  and yet they're here week in, week out, tirelessly,
[78.46 --> 79.94]  often away from their spouses and families.
[79.94 --> 82.00]  And we're very grateful that because of them,
[82.10 --> 83.50]  we can worship together in our homes.
[84.94 --> 87.62]  We're going to jump back into our Revelation series,
[87.72 --> 90.90]  looking at the seven letters that Jesus has John send
[90.90 --> 92.74]  to the seven churches in Asia Minor.
[93.24 --> 94.32]  As we said last week,
[94.36 --> 96.88]  these are serious letters for serious times.
[97.58 --> 100.56]  And I invite you, if you have your Bible,
[100.92 --> 103.96]  grab the book of Revelation and turn with me to chapter 2
[103.96 --> 105.50]  as we read the first letter,
[105.56 --> 107.14]  the letter to the church in Ephesus.
[107.14 --> 116.48]  To the angel of the church in Ephesus write,
[117.62 --> 120.60]  these are the words of him who holds the seven stars
[120.60 --> 125.46]  in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands.
[126.22 --> 130.82]  I know your deeds, your hard work, and your perseverance.
[131.38 --> 134.52]  I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people,
[134.52 --> 138.40]  that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not
[138.40 --> 139.72]  and have found them false.
[140.40 --> 144.44]  You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name
[144.44 --> 145.98]  and have not grown weary.
[147.14 --> 148.96]  Yet I hold this against you.
[149.68 --> 152.74]  You have forsaken the love you had at first.
[153.46 --> 155.22]  Consider how far you've fallen.
[156.16 --> 158.46]  Repent and do the things you did at first.
[158.46 --> 160.78]  If you do not repent, I will come
[160.78 --> 163.46]  and I will remove your lampstand from its place.
[164.52 --> 166.00]  But you have this in your favor.
[166.82 --> 168.80]  You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans,
[169.06 --> 170.44]  which I also hate.
[171.48 --> 173.10]  Whoever has ears to hear,
[173.36 --> 175.74]  let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[176.58 --> 178.14]  To those who are victorious,
[178.66 --> 181.92]  I will give the right to eat from the tree of life,
[182.18 --> 184.20]  which is in the paradise of God.
[184.20 --> 186.90]  So far the reading of God's Word.
[189.64 --> 192.34]  Well, I mentioned last week in our introduction
[192.34 --> 194.04]  that this is a revelation.
[194.58 --> 196.22]  It is an apocalyptic book of visions.
[196.36 --> 199.22]  It's a prophecy, but the future with present tense implications
[199.22 --> 200.48]  and revelation is a letter.
[201.08 --> 202.68]  And I have this map up on the screen,
[203.08 --> 205.08]  not just for Jerry Hanlon, who loves maps,
[205.20 --> 206.54]  but because this just gives you, again,
[206.62 --> 208.92]  a historical frame for the book of Revelation.
[209.12 --> 210.96]  You'll see in the bottom left-hand side,
[211.52 --> 213.08]  that little island there is Patmos.
[213.08 --> 215.98]  That's where John was exiled and where he had the vision,
[216.10 --> 217.38]  where he then wrote and sent.
[217.48 --> 219.86]  You'll see the first city, if the map is big enough, is Ephesus.
[220.24 --> 222.28]  The reason Ephesus is addressed first
[222.28 --> 224.84]  is simply because Ephesus is a port city.
[224.96 --> 226.52]  They're the first city closest to Patmos.
[226.76 --> 228.10]  And then it goes from there to Smyrna
[228.10 --> 230.90]  and on around like a loop over to Laodicea.
[231.14 --> 233.86]  This is a circular letter to real churches
[233.86 --> 235.04]  facing real challenges.
[235.20 --> 238.30]  And you'll see me emphasizing that throughout our series,
[238.40 --> 240.20]  that this is a real book to real churches.
[240.20 --> 242.60]  I also mentioned last week
[242.60 --> 246.06]  that there is a structure to each of these letters.
[246.18 --> 248.18]  Jesus has a specific word to all the churches,
[248.52 --> 249.90]  but there's a structure you'll see
[249.90 --> 251.54]  that sort of flows through each of these letters.
[251.66 --> 253.80]  And it opens up always with Jesus making
[253.80 --> 255.78]  a powerful statement about who he is.
[256.10 --> 258.42]  In Ephesus, it's he holds the seven stars,
[258.54 --> 259.46]  which are the seven churches.
[259.78 --> 262.06]  In other churches, it's the one who holds the sword.
[262.16 --> 263.00]  He wields power.
[263.28 --> 264.44]  He's the alpha and the omega.
[264.54 --> 265.62]  It's a statement that Jesus makes
[265.62 --> 267.06]  about his own power and his authority,
[267.06 --> 268.42]  the one who speaks.
[269.08 --> 270.90]  And then he moves to commend
[270.90 --> 274.70]  and to encourage what he sees going well in the church.
[274.76 --> 276.50]  He sort of speaks into the life.
[277.34 --> 280.62]  From there, he moves to challenge and exhort.
[280.72 --> 281.42]  And I want you to know,
[281.52 --> 282.30]  as we go through these letters,
[282.36 --> 284.70]  you're going to notice that Jesus is like a good doctor.
[285.50 --> 286.78]  He gives it to the church straight.
[286.94 --> 289.08]  He doesn't sort of like slough off the issues.
[289.22 --> 291.06]  He doesn't sort of neglect the problems.
[291.14 --> 291.90]  He gives it to them straight.
[291.96 --> 293.68]  He says, this is what's wrong.
[293.68 --> 295.48]  Here is what you need to do.
[295.58 --> 296.36]  And you'll see a lot.
[296.98 --> 297.34]  Repent.
[298.48 --> 299.70]  Repent from your ideology.
[299.90 --> 303.10]  Repent from the ways that you have fallen from Christ.
[304.32 --> 305.58]  And you'll see over again,
[305.72 --> 309.16]  Jesus moves from there to invite people to listen to him.
[309.22 --> 311.30]  He says, he who has ears, let them hear.
[311.92 --> 313.06]  And then he gives a promise.
[313.86 --> 314.86]  To those who are victorious,
[314.94 --> 316.72]  to those who listen, who repent, who follow,
[316.82 --> 319.26]  who stay in Christ in the midst of difficult circumstances,
[319.88 --> 321.16]  they are given the blessing.
[321.16 --> 323.98]  The blessing of future life with Christ,
[324.12 --> 325.10]  the blessing of his presence,
[325.50 --> 327.26]  the blessing of eternal life.
[327.48 --> 328.96]  All of that you see at the end of these letters,
[329.06 --> 331.24]  the blessing that comes, the hope that comes.
[331.84 --> 332.60]  That's the structure.
[333.62 --> 334.16]  So with that in mind,
[334.22 --> 336.02]  let's take a look at what Jesus himself
[336.02 --> 337.88]  says to his church in Ephesus.
[338.04 --> 338.82]  We read at the beginning,
[338.96 --> 341.30]  these are the words of him who holds the seven stars
[341.30 --> 342.42]  in his right hand
[342.42 --> 344.96]  and walks among the seven golden lampstands.
[344.98 --> 346.64]  And the lampstands, of course, are the churches.
[347.24 --> 348.42]  And the stars are the messengers
[348.42 --> 349.74]  of the angels of the churches.
[349.74 --> 351.22]  And as one writer says,
[351.28 --> 352.50]  it's a beautiful image again
[352.50 --> 354.98]  of Jesus who Revelation depicts
[354.98 --> 357.52]  as this powerful king.
[358.48 --> 361.40]  This Jesus is walking among the churches.
[362.24 --> 364.66]  This is the same Jesus who doesn't just walk with them.
[364.74 --> 368.00]  He holds the churches in his hand.
[368.56 --> 369.66]  All of them.
[369.84 --> 370.78]  And that's not just a word
[370.78 --> 372.06]  to the seven churches in Asia Minor.
[372.12 --> 374.48]  That's a word to Hope Community Church in Surrey.
[375.20 --> 376.72]  Jesus holds the church.
[376.72 --> 379.28]  This is the words of one who loves
[379.28 --> 381.34]  and died for his church
[381.34 --> 383.12]  and is deeply concerned
[383.12 --> 384.92]  with the intricate happenings
[384.92 --> 386.86]  of these communities of faith.
[388.24 --> 389.76]  And this then is what Jesus says
[389.76 --> 390.64]  to the church in Ephesus.
[390.82 --> 393.38]  I know your deeds.
[394.80 --> 396.32]  Churches do not need to explain
[396.32 --> 397.36]  what's happening to Jesus.
[397.48 --> 399.20]  He knows what's happening in the church.
[399.46 --> 401.62]  And let's just focus for the first little bit
[401.62 --> 403.60]  on what Jesus commends
[403.60 --> 405.92]  in this church in Ephesus.
[407.06 --> 408.18]  And just so you know,
[408.28 --> 408.94]  a foreshadowing here,
[408.98 --> 410.06]  I think we have a lot to learn
[410.06 --> 411.78]  and take notes on
[411.78 --> 412.94]  from what Jesus commends.
[413.00 --> 413.90]  The first thing he says,
[413.96 --> 415.12]  he commends them for
[415.12 --> 416.88]  their hard work
[416.88 --> 418.20]  and their perseverance.
[419.08 --> 420.32]  This is not a church
[420.32 --> 421.82]  that's sitting on their hands.
[422.18 --> 423.02]  This is not a church
[423.02 --> 424.60]  that's sort of under the pressure
[424.60 --> 425.68]  of the Roman Empire
[425.68 --> 426.52]  or under the pressure
[426.52 --> 427.46]  of all sorts of false teachers
[427.46 --> 429.22]  that are sort of backing off
[429.22 --> 430.60]  and letting things slide.
[430.68 --> 432.10]  They are actively involved.
[432.22 --> 433.08]  In fact, the word perseverance
[433.08 --> 433.94]  is that they're working
[433.94 --> 435.44]  to the point of exhaustion.
[436.30 --> 437.56]  They're sharing the gospel
[437.56 --> 438.30]  even though it's hard.
[438.40 --> 439.48]  They're doing the work of Christ.
[439.56 --> 440.66]  They're bearing witness in the city
[440.66 --> 441.74]  even though it's hard.
[441.84 --> 442.38]  And Jesus says,
[442.48 --> 443.50]  I see that.
[444.06 --> 445.90]  You are a hard working church.
[446.90 --> 447.92]  I commend you.
[450.10 --> 450.64]  You know, I think
[450.64 --> 451.86]  in our own circumstances,
[452.04 --> 453.96]  COVID provides its own set
[453.96 --> 454.98]  of challenges for the church.
[455.04 --> 455.64]  And I happen to think
[455.64 --> 457.00]  it's a test for many churches
[457.00 --> 458.82]  because there is a temptation
[458.82 --> 459.98]  in the season
[459.98 --> 460.78]  where we can't gather
[460.78 --> 462.14]  or a lot of stuff can't happen
[462.14 --> 463.46]  to sit on our own hands
[463.46 --> 464.94]  and to be passive
[464.94 --> 466.20]  and sort of just kind of
[466.20 --> 467.32]  wait for things to pass
[467.32 --> 468.38]  and we'll get back to ministry
[468.38 --> 469.74]  when things are a little easier for us.
[470.06 --> 470.98]  And COVID pushed the test
[470.98 --> 471.30]  of the church.
[471.38 --> 472.60]  Are you going to be the church,
[473.36 --> 474.30]  the scattered church
[474.30 --> 475.00]  throughout the city
[475.00 --> 475.84]  when you can't gather
[475.84 --> 476.54]  in the way you want?
[477.26 --> 478.20]  Are you going to be creative
[478.20 --> 479.74]  and try new ways
[479.74 --> 480.32]  of ministering
[480.32 --> 481.26]  and bearing witness to Christ
[481.26 --> 481.96]  and evangelism
[481.96 --> 483.08]  even though you can't gather?
[483.40 --> 484.30]  Will this be a time
[484.30 --> 485.20]  where the church of Jesus
[485.20 --> 486.28]  will be hearing the words
[486.28 --> 486.66]  from Jesus?
[487.16 --> 488.26]  You have worked hard.
[488.82 --> 490.08]  And you've persevered.
[490.36 --> 491.22]  And his word to the church
[491.22 --> 491.84]  in Ephesus is
[491.84 --> 492.82]  you are working hard
[492.82 --> 493.88]  and you have persevered
[493.88 --> 494.98]  and I've seen it.
[495.64 --> 496.58]  I commend you for that.
[497.64 --> 498.62]  The second thing
[498.62 --> 499.78]  that Jesus commends
[499.78 --> 500.62]  the church for
[500.62 --> 501.98]  is discernment.
[502.84 --> 504.20]  This is a discerning church
[504.20 --> 504.96]  both in terms of
[504.96 --> 505.96]  the biblical teaching
[505.96 --> 506.48]  of the church
[506.48 --> 507.78]  and in the leadership
[507.78 --> 508.46]  of the church.
[508.56 --> 509.50]  Two critical pieces
[509.50 --> 510.52]  for any healthy church.
[510.82 --> 511.42]  The teaching
[511.42 --> 512.52]  and the leadership.
[513.26 --> 514.14]  And this is just
[514.14 --> 514.86]  a hunch of mine
[514.86 --> 515.52]  but I have a feeling
[515.52 --> 516.78]  every person who grew up
[516.78 --> 517.28]  in Canada
[517.28 --> 518.18]  and is sort of steeped
[518.18 --> 518.94]  in Canadian culture
[518.94 --> 520.68]  has a little bit of a wince
[520.68 --> 522.64]  as we hear this passage.
[523.20 --> 523.34]  You know,
[523.40 --> 524.20]  we hear Jesus saying
[524.20 --> 524.88]  to the church
[524.88 --> 526.94]  I know that you can't
[526.94 --> 528.86]  tolerate wicked people.
[529.82 --> 530.80]  And our Canadian instinct
[530.80 --> 531.24]  is to say
[531.24 --> 532.40]  pardon me Jesus?
[533.20 --> 533.80]  Aren't you supposed
[533.80 --> 534.40]  to commend them
[534.40 --> 535.92]  for tolerance?
[536.72 --> 538.10]  Isn't that the default mode,
[538.18 --> 539.04]  the default virtue
[539.04 --> 539.82]  of Canadian culture,
[539.92 --> 541.08]  this idea of tolerance?
[541.70 --> 542.28]  And then later
[542.28 --> 543.02]  he says to them
[543.02 --> 543.54]  you have this
[543.54 --> 544.12]  in your favor.
[544.38 --> 545.38]  You hate the practices
[545.38 --> 546.32]  of the Nicolaitans
[546.32 --> 547.82]  which I also hate.
[548.78 --> 549.52]  Like whoa Jesus
[549.52 --> 551.10]  this is sharp language
[551.10 --> 552.64]  about what's going on.
[553.40 --> 554.40]  I'm commending you
[554.40 --> 555.38]  for not tolerating
[555.38 --> 555.98]  wicked people.
[556.26 --> 556.78]  And here's why
[556.78 --> 557.50]  that's important.
[557.74 --> 558.52]  Here's why it matters.
[558.66 --> 559.78]  This is a situation
[559.78 --> 560.24]  in Ephesus.
[560.78 --> 561.48]  There are not,
[561.62 --> 562.26]  there's a lot of
[562.26 --> 563.24]  different groups of people
[563.24 --> 565.16]  who have very different
[565.16 --> 565.66]  teachings about
[565.66 --> 565.98]  what it means
[565.98 --> 566.40]  to be a Christian,
[566.50 --> 566.72]  what it means
[566.72 --> 567.28]  to live in culture
[567.28 --> 568.70]  and they're seeking influence.
[568.80 --> 569.28]  And we see this
[569.28 --> 570.16]  even when Paul writes
[570.16 --> 571.24]  to the church in Ephesus
[571.24 --> 572.24]  there's a lot of
[572.24 --> 573.08]  competing groups
[573.08 --> 573.86]  that want power
[573.86 --> 574.36]  and authority
[574.36 --> 575.52]  and voice and influence
[575.52 --> 576.46]  in the church.
[576.90 --> 577.46]  And there are people
[577.46 --> 578.24]  who are claiming
[578.24 --> 579.32]  apostolic authority,
[579.46 --> 580.04]  claiming sort of
[580.04 --> 581.28]  understanding the teaching
[581.28 --> 582.36]  of Jesus and authority
[582.36 --> 583.46]  in it and they are going
[583.46 --> 584.58]  in a very different direction.
[585.44 --> 586.36]  And they are wicked people.
[586.48 --> 587.34]  They are not godly.
[587.78 --> 588.56]  They are not grounded
[588.56 --> 589.32]  in biblical teaching.
[589.46 --> 590.30]  And the church in Ephesus
[590.30 --> 591.24]  has the guts to say
[591.24 --> 592.30]  no way.
[592.84 --> 594.34]  You cannot lead our church.
[594.66 --> 595.56]  We may be small.
[595.68 --> 596.46]  We may be persecuted.
[596.46 --> 597.76]  But we will not allow
[597.76 --> 599.10]  this body of faith
[599.10 --> 600.14]  to be shaped
[600.14 --> 601.14]  by wicked teaching
[601.14 --> 603.06]  and unfaithful practices.
[604.04 --> 604.94]  And they rejected
[604.94 --> 605.64]  false teachers.
[606.66 --> 607.10]  And secondly,
[607.20 --> 607.68]  and this is probably
[607.68 --> 608.34]  really related,
[608.84 --> 609.62]  I agree with writers
[609.62 --> 610.20]  who think that
[610.20 --> 610.90]  the Nicolaitans
[610.90 --> 612.14]  are one of those groups.
[612.66 --> 613.62]  We don't know a ton
[613.62 --> 614.58]  about the Nicolaitans.
[614.84 --> 615.86]  They show up more than once
[615.86 --> 616.78]  in these letters
[616.78 --> 617.56]  to the seven churches.
[617.68 --> 618.32]  But we do know
[618.32 --> 619.24]  that they advocated
[619.24 --> 620.68]  for a very loose,
[621.10 --> 622.54]  relaxed approach to faith.
[623.22 --> 624.08]  And their desire
[624.08 --> 624.94]  was for the church
[624.94 --> 625.92]  to sort of fit in
[625.92 --> 626.86]  and not just fit in,
[626.86 --> 627.96]  but be able to profit
[627.96 --> 629.36]  from the culture.
[629.46 --> 629.88]  And you should know
[629.88 --> 631.32]  Ephesus is a wealthy port city
[631.32 --> 632.46]  and there's a lot of pressure.
[632.60 --> 632.72]  You know,
[632.76 --> 633.94]  if you just leave this
[633.94 --> 634.48]  out of your faith
[634.48 --> 635.36]  or you don't care about this,
[635.40 --> 635.78]  you're going to have
[635.78 --> 637.86]  a good life as believers.
[638.14 --> 638.82]  And the Nicolaitans
[638.82 --> 639.12]  were saying,
[639.16 --> 640.04]  hey, just relax.
[640.50 --> 641.36]  You can eat the meat
[641.36 --> 642.52]  that was offered to idols.
[643.38 --> 644.82]  You can do whatever you want
[644.82 --> 645.46]  with your bodies
[645.46 --> 646.44]  and your sexual life.
[646.46 --> 647.12]  It doesn't matter.
[648.06 --> 648.78]  And the church, again,
[648.82 --> 650.06]  they look at the Nicolaitans
[650.06 --> 651.52]  who wanted influence
[651.52 --> 651.90]  and they said,
[651.96 --> 653.54]  no, this isn't what it means
[653.54 --> 654.10]  to be the church.
[654.18 --> 655.18]  We will not give you authority.
[655.28 --> 656.16]  We will not let your voice
[656.16 --> 657.40]  shape this community of faith.
[657.64 --> 658.60]  They rejected it.
[658.66 --> 659.58]  And you think, wow,
[660.34 --> 661.42]  here's a small church
[661.42 --> 662.50]  under a great deal of pressure
[662.50 --> 663.56]  that has the wisdom
[663.56 --> 664.62]  and the discernment
[664.62 --> 665.86]  to say, no,
[666.66 --> 668.34]  this is not who we are.
[668.44 --> 669.78]  This is not what the teacher,
[670.14 --> 671.06]  our teacher, Jesus,
[671.24 --> 671.98]  has given us.
[672.04 --> 673.10]  This is not the pattern
[673.10 --> 674.42]  of sound teaching.
[675.98 --> 676.90]  That's impressive,
[677.02 --> 677.52]  don't you think?
[678.66 --> 679.88]  And I already hinted before
[679.88 --> 680.84]  that I think there's a lot
[680.84 --> 681.74]  for us to learn
[681.74 --> 682.98]  from the church in Ephesus.
[682.98 --> 684.86]  And this is just
[684.86 --> 686.46]  a broad sweeping statement,
[686.58 --> 687.80]  but I think on the whole,
[688.74 --> 689.50]  Western churches,
[689.64 --> 690.38]  Canadian churches,
[690.78 --> 692.72]  we lean towards
[692.72 --> 694.44]  a relaxed view
[694.44 --> 696.08]  of teaching
[696.08 --> 697.14]  and theology
[697.14 --> 698.30]  and doctrine.
[699.28 --> 700.16]  And we more and more,
[700.28 --> 701.34]  and sometimes there's good motive,
[701.46 --> 701.56]  you know,
[701.60 --> 702.56]  we want to be ecumenical,
[702.68 --> 703.34]  we want to get along
[703.34 --> 703.98]  with other churches,
[704.08 --> 704.76]  we don't want to be fighting
[704.76 --> 705.32]  with each other,
[705.38 --> 706.00]  and we sort of say,
[706.10 --> 707.94]  okay, let's not get too hung up
[707.94 --> 708.60]  about the teaching.
[709.20 --> 710.38]  Let's not get too hung up
[710.38 --> 711.34]  about what it says here
[711.34 --> 712.20]  about sexuality
[712.20 --> 712.86]  and marriage
[712.86 --> 713.56]  or what it says there
[713.56 --> 714.84]  about the exclusivity of Jesus
[714.84 --> 715.94]  or judgment,
[716.14 --> 717.12]  which you can't avoid
[717.12 --> 718.06]  in the book of Revelation.
[718.38 --> 719.52]  Let's not get too hung up
[719.52 --> 720.02]  on these things
[720.02 --> 720.52]  and divide.
[720.62 --> 722.00]  Let's just relax
[722.00 --> 723.56]  a little bit, right?
[724.08 --> 724.86]  We have a bit of a
[724.86 --> 726.12]  laissez-faire approach
[726.12 --> 727.68]  to teaching and doctrine.
[727.92 --> 729.76]  And we read very clearly
[729.76 --> 732.78]  that Jesus is commending
[732.78 --> 734.06]  the church in Ephesus
[734.06 --> 736.08]  for a keen eye
[736.08 --> 738.16]  on what shapes
[738.16 --> 739.36]  the minds
[739.36 --> 740.14]  and the hearts
[740.14 --> 741.26]  of their believers.
[742.00 --> 742.80]  They are attentive
[742.80 --> 744.66]  to the shaping teaching
[744.66 --> 745.46]  of the church,
[745.62 --> 746.94]  and they are protecting
[746.94 --> 749.02]  and will need to protect
[749.02 --> 752.18]  faithful biblical teaching.
[753.46 --> 754.50]  Every generation
[754.50 --> 755.54]  is going to face challenges
[755.54 --> 756.08]  in this front.
[756.68 --> 758.36]  Our church in Western,
[758.84 --> 760.02]  post-Christian British Columbia
[760.02 --> 760.72]  is no exception,
[760.94 --> 761.84]  and the church in Ephesus
[761.84 --> 763.14]  is a model of people saying,
[763.62 --> 765.04]  this is not faithful.
[765.66 --> 766.38]  These leaders
[766.38 --> 767.52]  are not qualified.
[767.52 --> 769.68]  This can't happen,
[769.78 --> 771.28]  and Jesus commends that.
[773.58 --> 774.44]  Biblical teaching
[774.44 --> 775.28]  matters to Jesus.
[775.82 --> 776.78]  Faithful leadership
[776.78 --> 777.68]  matters to Jesus.
[779.24 --> 780.48]  And we need to listen
[780.48 --> 782.50]  to what they have to teach us,
[782.54 --> 783.38]  and I'll come back to that.
[784.04 --> 784.60]  Verse 4,
[785.02 --> 786.04]  we see the shift.
[786.88 --> 787.32]  Verse 4,
[787.40 --> 788.32]  Jesus says to the church
[788.32 --> 788.68]  in Ephesus,
[788.90 --> 791.72]  yet I have this against you.
[792.58 --> 793.66]  You have forsaken
[793.66 --> 795.58]  the love you had at first.
[795.72 --> 796.98]  Consider how far
[796.98 --> 797.94]  you have fallen.
[798.44 --> 799.78]  Repent and do the things
[799.78 --> 800.86]  you did at first.
[801.88 --> 802.94]  Now, this is the issue
[802.94 --> 803.64]  that Jesus had
[803.64 --> 804.46]  with the church in Ephesus.
[804.70 --> 805.36]  This is a church
[805.36 --> 806.30]  that concerned themselves
[806.30 --> 807.20]  with pure teaching,
[807.56 --> 808.14]  with doctrine,
[808.26 --> 808.78]  with making sure
[808.78 --> 809.40]  they're faithful
[809.40 --> 810.44]  to what Jesus himself
[810.44 --> 811.46]  handed down to them,
[812.00 --> 813.26]  but their interest
[813.26 --> 814.32]  in purity of teaching
[814.32 --> 815.62]  led to a lack of love.
[816.66 --> 818.06]  They had lost the love
[818.06 --> 818.74]  they had at first.
[818.80 --> 819.64]  Now, there is some debate
[819.64 --> 821.58]  about what exactly Jesus means
[821.58 --> 822.24]  when he says this
[822.24 --> 822.70]  to the church.
[822.80 --> 823.06]  Some say,
[823.14 --> 824.02]  well, maybe they've lost
[824.02 --> 824.80]  their love for Jesus.
[824.98 --> 826.06]  They've sort of lost
[826.06 --> 827.32]  their affection for God.
[827.74 --> 828.82]  And I tend to disagree
[828.82 --> 829.48]  because I think
[829.48 --> 830.22]  they're actually giving up
[830.22 --> 831.60]  a great deal for Jesus,
[831.72 --> 832.34]  and they're making
[832.34 --> 833.28]  great sacrifices
[833.28 --> 833.96]  so that they stay
[833.96 --> 834.82]  faithful in him.
[835.10 --> 835.86]  The issue here,
[835.96 --> 836.36]  I believe,
[836.44 --> 837.28]  is that they have lost
[837.28 --> 838.42]  their love for one another.
[839.84 --> 840.42]  They have forgotten
[840.42 --> 840.82]  what it means
[840.82 --> 841.48]  to be a family
[841.48 --> 842.18]  knit together
[842.18 --> 843.22]  in the love of Christ.
[844.20 --> 844.94]  And Jesus says,
[844.94 --> 846.26]  how far you have fallen
[846.26 --> 847.68]  from your love.
[847.68 --> 851.48]  Their zeal for truth,
[851.66 --> 852.26]  you might say,
[852.36 --> 853.62]  undercut their call
[853.62 --> 854.74]  to love one another.
[855.00 --> 855.48]  And I don't think
[855.48 --> 856.06]  it's hard for us
[856.06 --> 856.78]  to understand this.
[856.86 --> 857.48]  I mean, just imagine
[857.48 --> 858.10]  you're in a situation
[858.10 --> 858.84]  where there's persecution
[858.84 --> 859.60]  in the empire.
[860.10 --> 860.98]  There's all these
[860.98 --> 861.42]  different groups
[861.42 --> 862.44]  that are vying for power
[862.44 --> 862.92]  and authority
[862.92 --> 863.90]  and having their teaching
[863.90 --> 864.46]  be the teaching
[864.46 --> 865.32]  that shapes the church.
[865.66 --> 866.78]  And I think in this context,
[866.82 --> 867.42]  if you're someone
[867.42 --> 868.70]  who's bought into the church,
[869.06 --> 870.38]  you almost become suspicious,
[871.04 --> 871.16]  you know,
[871.20 --> 872.10]  protectionistic
[872.10 --> 873.56]  about what's going to shape
[873.56 --> 874.20]  and who's going to be
[874.20 --> 875.02]  the leaders of your church,
[875.08 --> 875.88]  you become a little bit
[875.88 --> 877.32]  almost jaded towards
[877.32 --> 878.28]  all the conflict
[878.28 --> 878.88]  and the challenges
[878.88 --> 879.40]  that come.
[880.02 --> 880.90]  It's not hard to imagine
[880.90 --> 881.72]  how in that circumstance
[881.72 --> 883.58]  it's hard to love people.
[884.12 --> 884.82]  There are people in your church
[884.82 --> 885.38]  who are advocating
[885.38 --> 886.18]  false teaching.
[886.88 --> 887.58]  It's hard to love.
[888.38 --> 889.54]  I mean, aside from that,
[889.60 --> 890.56]  I think we can accept
[890.56 --> 891.48]  and acknowledge
[891.48 --> 893.18]  that it's hard to love
[893.18 --> 894.66]  anyone and everyone
[894.66 --> 896.28]  in every church, right?
[897.00 --> 897.98]  I'm sure there are times
[897.98 --> 898.66]  where when we could
[898.66 --> 899.20]  gather together,
[899.26 --> 900.18]  you kind of look around
[900.18 --> 901.40]  the room at our own community
[901.40 --> 901.92]  and think, man,
[902.14 --> 903.24]  I wouldn't have picked
[903.24 --> 903.84]  these friends.
[903.84 --> 905.84]  I don't hate them,
[906.46 --> 907.08]  but it's like,
[907.52 --> 908.54]  this is a unique community.
[908.74 --> 909.14]  And you think,
[909.24 --> 910.28]  if it wasn't for Jesus
[910.28 --> 912.06]  and Jesus working our lives,
[912.18 --> 913.40]  we would never be together
[913.40 --> 913.96]  worshiping.
[914.06 --> 914.88]  Like, we're a unique
[914.88 --> 915.66]  bunch of people
[915.66 --> 917.40]  and it doesn't take much
[917.40 --> 918.36]  for conflict,
[918.76 --> 919.74]  church history proves this,
[919.78 --> 920.42]  it doesn't take much
[920.42 --> 921.38]  for conflict to arise
[921.38 --> 921.80]  in the church
[921.80 --> 922.54]  over big things
[922.54 --> 924.44]  and over little things.
[924.54 --> 926.16]  We're a diverse group
[926.16 --> 927.92]  called to love one another.
[929.68 --> 930.56]  A couple years ago,
[930.60 --> 931.66]  I was listening to a podcast
[931.66 --> 933.08]  podcast by a sociologist.
[933.38 --> 933.96]  He was a believer
[933.96 --> 935.34]  and he's sharing a bit
[935.34 --> 936.14]  of his own story
[936.14 --> 937.12]  going into sociology
[937.12 --> 937.82]  but also a bit of
[937.82 --> 938.58]  a story of faith
[938.58 --> 940.12]  and he shared about
[940.12 --> 941.30]  his church growing up
[941.30 --> 942.28]  and I was quite taken
[942.28 --> 943.26]  by this because he said
[943.26 --> 944.20]  he was so thankful
[944.20 --> 945.88]  for his childhood church
[945.88 --> 946.60]  and it was a fairly
[946.60 --> 947.38]  conservative church
[947.38 --> 948.24]  by today's standards
[948.24 --> 949.64]  and he's so thankful
[949.64 --> 950.24]  for the way he was
[950.24 --> 951.00]  learning the scriptures,
[951.58 --> 953.16]  for his sense of the gospel,
[953.32 --> 954.42]  the clarity of what it meant
[954.42 --> 955.16]  to follow Jesus
[955.16 --> 956.18]  and the biblical teaching
[956.18 --> 956.92]  was so rich.
[957.48 --> 957.68]  He said,
[957.72 --> 958.24]  but I had to leave
[958.24 --> 958.76]  that church.
[959.50 --> 959.68]  I was like,
[959.70 --> 960.22]  well, why would you leave
[960.22 --> 960.88]  a church like that?
[961.88 --> 962.28]  And he said,
[962.34 --> 962.94]  this is the issue
[962.94 --> 963.36]  with the church
[963.36 --> 964.00]  I grew up in.
[964.80 --> 966.14]  It was always in conflict.
[966.98 --> 968.20]  There was always a leader
[968.20 --> 969.24]  advocating for this
[969.24 --> 970.00]  particular teaching
[970.00 --> 970.88]  and there's another camp
[970.88 --> 972.06]  advocating for a different position.
[972.40 --> 973.68]  There was always conflict
[973.68 --> 974.14]  in the church
[974.14 --> 975.80]  over some theological issue
[975.80 --> 976.16]  or another.
[976.30 --> 977.18]  Sometimes it was important,
[977.44 --> 978.56]  other times it was two people
[978.56 --> 979.84]  who just loved
[979.84 --> 982.14]  hunting out potential heresies
[982.14 --> 983.10]  and he described
[983.10 --> 983.82]  his childhood church
[983.82 --> 984.80]  as a tempest
[984.80 --> 985.74]  in a teapot.
[986.54 --> 987.32]  Always fighting,
[988.24 --> 989.12]  always in conflict
[989.12 --> 989.44]  and said,
[989.52 --> 990.88]  I could not stay
[990.88 --> 991.58]  in that church
[991.58 --> 992.20]  and I know
[992.20 --> 993.48]  there are some people
[993.48 --> 994.58]  here at Hope Community Church
[994.58 --> 995.64]  who've left churches
[995.64 --> 996.22]  like that
[996.22 --> 997.56]  and he said,
[997.66 --> 998.56]  I can't grow
[998.56 --> 999.52]  in a community
[999.52 --> 1000.26]  where there is always
[1000.26 --> 1001.48]  conflict over this teaching
[1001.48 --> 1001.98]  or that.
[1002.36 --> 1003.74]  There's always a hunting out
[1003.74 --> 1004.60]  of those who disagree
[1004.60 --> 1004.94]  with you,
[1005.02 --> 1006.24]  always camps being formed
[1006.24 --> 1007.48]  around this passage
[1007.48 --> 1008.42]  or that.
[1011.42 --> 1012.96]  The issue for the Ephesian church
[1012.96 --> 1014.46]  was lovelessness
[1014.46 --> 1016.22]  and this is a serious problem.
[1016.40 --> 1016.52]  You know,
[1016.56 --> 1017.42]  we can read this passage
[1017.42 --> 1017.62]  and think,
[1017.70 --> 1018.06]  oh man,
[1018.06 --> 1018.80]  they have to love one another.
[1018.94 --> 1020.10]  It's a very important teaching.
[1020.52 --> 1021.62]  Jesus puts it so serious.
[1021.70 --> 1022.68]  This is how he phrases it.
[1022.70 --> 1022.94]  He says,
[1023.06 --> 1024.24]  if you don't repent
[1024.24 --> 1025.42]  and learn to love
[1025.42 --> 1026.14]  one another again,
[1026.38 --> 1027.58]  I will come to you
[1027.58 --> 1028.82]  and I will remove
[1028.82 --> 1030.10]  your lampstand.
[1031.32 --> 1031.62]  Do you know
[1031.62 --> 1032.34]  what he's saying there?
[1033.14 --> 1034.26]  I'll remove your lampstand.
[1035.00 --> 1035.88]  He's basically saying,
[1036.36 --> 1038.16]  you don't get to be a church
[1038.16 --> 1039.88]  if you don't love one another.
[1040.76 --> 1041.68]  You can gather,
[1042.16 --> 1043.14]  you can do what you're doing,
[1043.28 --> 1044.18]  you can go through
[1044.18 --> 1045.02]  the things that you're doing
[1045.02 --> 1045.54]  as a house church,
[1045.54 --> 1046.42]  but you just can't be
[1046.42 --> 1047.34]  my church
[1047.34 --> 1048.62]  because if it is
[1048.62 --> 1049.92]  the church of Jesus Christ
[1049.92 --> 1050.54]  that gathers,
[1051.28 --> 1052.38]  it will be a community
[1052.38 --> 1053.38]  of love.
[1055.58 --> 1057.18]  If it's the church of Jesus,
[1057.86 --> 1060.48]  there must be love.
[1061.00 --> 1062.40]  That's how central love
[1062.40 --> 1063.52]  is to the Christian faith.
[1064.04 --> 1065.22]  I'm sure you can already have
[1065.22 --> 1066.08]  verses in the back
[1066.08 --> 1066.72]  of your mind percolating.
[1066.80 --> 1067.62]  For God so what?
[1067.96 --> 1068.96]  Loved the world
[1068.96 --> 1069.58]  that he gave
[1069.58 --> 1070.68]  his one and only son.
[1071.28 --> 1072.14]  Jesus saying to his disciples,
[1072.26 --> 1072.70]  greater love
[1072.70 --> 1074.02]  has nothing more than this
[1074.02 --> 1075.44]  than to lay down life
[1075.44 --> 1076.56]  for one's friends.
[1077.00 --> 1077.56]  And the passage
[1077.56 --> 1078.40]  that I found myself
[1078.40 --> 1079.26]  going to this week
[1079.26 --> 1080.24]  was from John 13
[1080.24 --> 1081.80]  where Jesus says
[1081.80 --> 1082.44]  to his disciples,
[1082.86 --> 1084.74]  a new command I give you.
[1085.74 --> 1086.32]  What is it?
[1087.26 --> 1088.54]  Love one another.
[1089.14 --> 1089.60]  By this,
[1090.00 --> 1091.00]  everyone will know
[1091.00 --> 1092.98]  that you are my disciples
[1092.98 --> 1095.54]  if you love each other.
[1097.04 --> 1098.38]  1 Corinthians 13,
[1098.50 --> 1099.92]  the famous wedding passage
[1099.92 --> 1100.94]  that every pastor
[1100.94 --> 1102.00]  secretly resents
[1102.00 --> 1103.70]  because we always talk
[1103.70 --> 1104.28]  about love being
[1104.28 --> 1105.08]  the greater thing.
[1105.22 --> 1105.92]  But Paul makes
[1105.92 --> 1106.98]  a really significant
[1106.98 --> 1107.50]  argument there.
[1107.56 --> 1108.22]  He says you can have
[1108.22 --> 1109.04]  the gift of tongues
[1109.04 --> 1109.44]  and again,
[1109.56 --> 1110.20]  the Corinthian church,
[1110.32 --> 1111.14]  very gifted church.
[1111.48 --> 1112.50]  You can speak in tongues,
[1112.62 --> 1113.42]  you can discern tongues,
[1113.52 --> 1113.92]  you can have the gift
[1113.92 --> 1115.26]  of healing, insight,
[1115.60 --> 1116.50]  all sorts of gifts.
[1116.58 --> 1118.28]  But if you do not have love,
[1118.44 --> 1119.82]  this basic foundational
[1119.82 --> 1120.96]  unifying dimension
[1120.96 --> 1121.92]  of being God's people,
[1122.12 --> 1122.66]  if you don't have it,
[1122.70 --> 1123.42]  it's for nothing.
[1124.54 --> 1125.14]  Could you imagine
[1125.14 --> 1126.06]  being in the Corinthian church?
[1126.56 --> 1127.32]  Look at all the stuff
[1127.32 --> 1127.92]  we have going on.
[1127.96 --> 1128.60]  There's people who can
[1128.60 --> 1129.28]  interpret tongues,
[1129.28 --> 1129.96]  there's speaking tongues,
[1130.04 --> 1130.52]  there's healings,
[1130.56 --> 1131.54]  there's words of insight,
[1131.78 --> 1132.68]  all sorts of amazing
[1132.68 --> 1133.22]  things happening.
[1133.34 --> 1133.70]  Paul says,
[1133.94 --> 1134.86]  is there love?
[1136.10 --> 1137.28]  Because that's the church
[1137.28 --> 1138.12]  if there's love.
[1141.70 --> 1142.68]  Now it seems to me
[1142.68 --> 1145.42]  that what we all long for
[1145.42 --> 1146.70]  is the church
[1146.70 --> 1147.60]  that is so grounded
[1147.60 --> 1148.50]  in biblical teaching,
[1148.90 --> 1150.18]  it's forming godly,
[1150.32 --> 1150.94]  faithful leaders,
[1151.20 --> 1153.58]  and it's grounded in love.
[1154.10 --> 1154.82]  And it seems to me
[1154.82 --> 1155.70]  that that is the distinct
[1155.70 --> 1156.56]  work of Jesus
[1156.56 --> 1157.74]  by the work of the Spirit
[1157.74 --> 1159.24]  to make that kind of church.
[1159.32 --> 1160.06]  And this is just
[1160.06 --> 1160.82]  my own opinion,
[1161.24 --> 1161.90]  but it seems to me
[1161.90 --> 1163.24]  that spiritual attack
[1163.24 --> 1163.86]  on the church
[1163.86 --> 1164.76]  pushes us
[1164.76 --> 1166.14]  in one of two extremes.
[1167.08 --> 1168.14]  The extremes are
[1168.14 --> 1169.86]  you are a very
[1169.86 --> 1171.26]  theologically astute,
[1171.74 --> 1172.92]  biblically sound church
[1172.92 --> 1174.14]  that lacks love.
[1175.24 --> 1177.64]  Or you're a very loving church,
[1177.80 --> 1178.18]  welcoming,
[1178.40 --> 1178.88]  compassionate,
[1179.28 --> 1180.34]  that stands for nothing.
[1181.06 --> 1181.54]  And you're open
[1181.54 --> 1182.52]  to all sorts of false teaching.
[1182.58 --> 1183.28]  Have you noticed this?
[1183.68 --> 1184.60]  It seems like the church
[1184.60 --> 1185.70]  is going one extreme
[1185.70 --> 1186.12]  or another.
[1186.22 --> 1187.12]  You're a staunch,
[1187.38 --> 1188.12]  loveless church,
[1188.24 --> 1189.00]  or you're sort of
[1189.00 --> 1190.68]  a loving jellyfish church.
[1191.52 --> 1192.70]  If I can use those categories.
[1193.54 --> 1194.34]  And what is needed
[1194.34 --> 1195.42]  and what Jesus wants
[1195.42 --> 1196.78]  the church in Ephesus to be
[1196.78 --> 1198.30]  is a devoted,
[1199.36 --> 1199.96]  sound,
[1200.56 --> 1201.50]  biblically faithful,
[1202.26 --> 1204.42]  deeply loving community.
[1205.36 --> 1206.12]  And to become
[1206.12 --> 1206.76]  that kind of church,
[1206.86 --> 1207.66]  we need the work
[1207.66 --> 1208.50]  of the Holy Spirit.
[1211.06 --> 1211.90]  Not that long ago,
[1211.94 --> 1212.36]  I read a book
[1212.36 --> 1213.14]  by Scott McKnight
[1213.14 --> 1214.46]  called A Fellowship of Difference.
[1214.46 --> 1216.12]  And Scott was just
[1216.12 --> 1216.84]  working out,
[1217.04 --> 1218.52]  how do we grow as a church
[1218.52 --> 1219.68]  when the church is so diverse?
[1219.78 --> 1220.52]  And he was looking a lot
[1220.52 --> 1221.28]  at the early church
[1221.28 --> 1222.64]  and just the incredible differences,
[1222.80 --> 1223.52]  Jew and Gentile,
[1223.64 --> 1224.32]  male and female,
[1224.50 --> 1225.42]  Greek, etc.
[1226.06 --> 1227.08]  How do we be
[1227.08 --> 1228.24]  like a unified body?
[1228.30 --> 1229.44]  And he spent a lot of time
[1229.44 --> 1231.00]  talking about love.
[1231.94 --> 1232.68]  And he realized
[1232.68 --> 1233.34]  that love is sort of
[1233.34 --> 1234.42]  this vacuous category
[1234.42 --> 1235.20]  that we can fill
[1235.20 --> 1236.18]  with whatever we want.
[1236.24 --> 1237.20]  And even as Western
[1237.20 --> 1237.80]  Canadian people,
[1237.80 --> 1238.98]  we have assumptions right away
[1238.98 --> 1240.40]  about what love is.
[1241.00 --> 1242.18]  And McKnight's main point
[1242.18 --> 1242.94]  in one of his chapters
[1242.94 --> 1244.38]  was we need to think about love
[1244.38 --> 1245.24]  as defined
[1245.24 --> 1246.26]  by the biblical story.
[1246.32 --> 1247.66]  And he highlighted three things
[1247.66 --> 1249.58]  that are central
[1249.58 --> 1251.06]  to biblical love.
[1251.14 --> 1251.82]  And I want to highlight
[1251.82 --> 1252.54]  them briefly.
[1253.50 --> 1254.76]  The first thing he says is
[1254.76 --> 1255.58]  if we're looking
[1255.58 --> 1256.44]  at the biblical story
[1256.44 --> 1257.40]  and the character of God,
[1257.76 --> 1258.82]  love is commitment.
[1259.98 --> 1261.22]  Love is commitment.
[1262.30 --> 1263.36]  God, we see throughout
[1263.36 --> 1264.00]  the biblical story,
[1264.06 --> 1265.14]  as He chooses His people,
[1265.24 --> 1266.22]  as He works in His world,
[1266.22 --> 1267.42]  He is committed
[1267.42 --> 1268.64]  to His people.
[1269.22 --> 1269.44]  I mean,
[1269.70 --> 1270.56]  He makes covenants
[1270.56 --> 1270.92]  with the people
[1270.92 --> 1271.78]  He knows are going
[1271.78 --> 1272.50]  to break the covenants.
[1272.56 --> 1273.26]  He binds Himself
[1273.26 --> 1274.00]  to people He knows
[1274.00 --> 1274.58]  are going to run away.
[1274.72 --> 1275.78]  He gives them the land.
[1275.88 --> 1276.76]  He gives them His instruction.
[1276.90 --> 1277.62]  He gives them the temple
[1277.62 --> 1279.16]  all so that they can enjoy
[1279.16 --> 1279.66]  His benefits,
[1279.78 --> 1280.26]  His presence,
[1280.82 --> 1282.30]  knowing that they will not
[1282.30 --> 1283.54]  be faithful to Him.
[1284.24 --> 1285.50]  And if that's God's character
[1285.50 --> 1286.42]  throughout the biblical story,
[1286.48 --> 1287.20]  the church is called
[1287.20 --> 1288.52]  to mirror that kind
[1288.52 --> 1288.96]  of commitment,
[1289.82 --> 1291.48]  to be together
[1291.48 --> 1292.40]  as a people
[1292.40 --> 1292.86]  who are not going
[1292.86 --> 1293.26]  to run away
[1293.26 --> 1293.92]  when it's hard,
[1294.22 --> 1294.50]  they're not going
[1294.50 --> 1295.40]  to give up on the church
[1295.40 --> 1296.12]  when there's conflict,
[1296.28 --> 1297.04]  but we're committed.
[1297.84 --> 1299.32]  The church is a community
[1299.32 --> 1299.84]  of people
[1299.84 --> 1300.94]  that are committed
[1300.94 --> 1301.66]  to one another
[1301.66 --> 1302.22]  and related.
[1302.36 --> 1303.06]  The second thing
[1303.06 --> 1303.92]  McKnight highlights
[1303.92 --> 1304.92]  about love
[1304.92 --> 1305.82]  in the biblical story
[1305.82 --> 1307.02]  is God's love
[1307.02 --> 1308.42]  is a love that is present.
[1309.52 --> 1311.66]  God is with His people.
[1312.32 --> 1313.22]  Throughout the biblical story,
[1313.26 --> 1314.16]  we see Him showing up
[1314.16 --> 1315.10]  and leading them,
[1315.24 --> 1315.68]  guiding them,
[1315.72 --> 1316.26]  His presence,
[1316.42 --> 1317.14]  mediating for them.
[1317.22 --> 1318.64]  God is always with His people.
[1318.84 --> 1319.58]  And it shouldn't surprise
[1319.58 --> 1320.30]  any of us
[1320.30 --> 1321.80]  that when God shows up
[1321.80 --> 1322.28]  to Joseph
[1322.28 --> 1323.66]  and He says that
[1323.66 --> 1324.56]  He's sending His son
[1324.56 --> 1325.22]  through Mary,
[1325.88 --> 1327.24]  the son's going to be Emmanuel.
[1327.24 --> 1327.36]  Emmanuel.
[1328.36 --> 1329.28]  And Emmanuel is what?
[1329.84 --> 1331.84]  God with us.
[1332.90 --> 1333.94]  That's God's character.
[1334.90 --> 1335.80]  And so it must be
[1335.80 --> 1336.52]  with the church.
[1337.44 --> 1338.82]  We must be
[1338.82 --> 1340.06]  with each other.
[1340.54 --> 1341.06]  And I know that
[1341.06 --> 1341.88]  even in saying it,
[1341.90 --> 1342.54]  your first thought is,
[1342.70 --> 1343.48]  well, of course,
[1343.56 --> 1344.68]  but we can't right now
[1344.68 --> 1345.48]  because of COVID.
[1345.88 --> 1346.56]  And I will say
[1346.56 --> 1347.58]  that a quiet prayer of mine
[1347.58 --> 1348.16]  throughout COVID
[1348.16 --> 1348.58]  has been
[1348.58 --> 1350.74]  that God would give us
[1350.74 --> 1351.54]  a deep hunger
[1351.54 --> 1353.46]  that when we can regather
[1353.46 --> 1354.84]  and when we no longer
[1354.84 --> 1356.08]  take gathering for granted,
[1356.20 --> 1356.92]  we have a deep hunger
[1356.92 --> 1357.84]  to be present
[1357.84 --> 1359.16]  to one another.
[1360.40 --> 1361.12]  And what we learn
[1361.12 --> 1361.70]  as pastors
[1361.70 --> 1362.36]  and in ministry
[1362.36 --> 1363.68]  is that one of the greatest gifts
[1363.68 --> 1364.72]  you can give to people
[1364.72 --> 1366.74]  is your presence.
[1368.34 --> 1368.50]  You know,
[1368.52 --> 1368.98]  my brother-in-law,
[1369.08 --> 1369.24]  Mark,
[1369.30 --> 1370.12]  shared with me a story
[1370.12 --> 1371.46]  a little while ago
[1371.46 --> 1372.58]  pre-COVID.
[1372.66 --> 1373.24]  There was someone
[1373.24 --> 1374.42]  in their community
[1374.42 --> 1375.36]  and their church
[1375.36 --> 1376.78]  who broke the law
[1376.78 --> 1378.00]  and was arrested
[1378.00 --> 1379.58]  and was sentenced.
[1380.32 --> 1381.08]  And shortly before
[1381.08 --> 1381.86]  going to prison,
[1382.58 --> 1383.80]  as leaders in the church,
[1383.86 --> 1384.06]  they said,
[1384.12 --> 1384.32]  you know what,
[1384.32 --> 1385.48]  we need to get together.
[1386.38 --> 1386.90]  And of course,
[1386.96 --> 1387.44]  the first thought is,
[1387.48 --> 1387.54]  well,
[1387.54 --> 1388.20]  what are we going to say?
[1388.30 --> 1388.94]  How do you have
[1388.94 --> 1389.64]  this kind of gathering
[1389.64 --> 1390.38]  with someone in your community
[1390.38 --> 1391.10]  who's going to prison?
[1391.64 --> 1391.92]  They said,
[1391.96 --> 1392.04]  well,
[1392.06 --> 1392.58]  we're going to gather.
[1392.64 --> 1393.32]  And so they had a barbecue
[1393.32 --> 1394.38]  and they invited him over
[1394.38 --> 1395.08]  and a bunch of people
[1395.08 --> 1395.56]  from the church
[1395.56 --> 1396.06]  who knew him,
[1396.12 --> 1396.96]  they just gathered together.
[1397.04 --> 1397.64]  And they didn't have
[1397.64 --> 1398.52]  the genius words
[1398.52 --> 1398.74]  of like,
[1398.80 --> 1399.66]  this is what we're going to say.
[1399.76 --> 1401.06]  This is what we're going to do.
[1401.10 --> 1401.30]  It's just,
[1401.40 --> 1402.16]  we're showing up
[1402.16 --> 1403.94]  and we're going to be present.
[1404.58 --> 1405.84]  And we're going to be the church
[1405.84 --> 1407.42]  in this hard place.
[1408.06 --> 1410.16]  And that person was deeply moved
[1410.16 --> 1410.78]  and blessed
[1410.78 --> 1413.00]  by the church that showed up
[1413.00 --> 1413.82]  and was present,
[1413.94 --> 1414.64]  even in the hard,
[1414.76 --> 1415.84]  broken, dark places.
[1417.10 --> 1417.92]  The third dimension
[1417.92 --> 1419.04]  that Scott McKnight highlights
[1419.04 --> 1419.74]  about love,
[1420.14 --> 1421.40]  biblical love,
[1421.64 --> 1422.62]  is that it's a commitment
[1422.62 --> 1424.42]  to be for someone.
[1425.22 --> 1425.82]  And I don't need to,
[1425.88 --> 1426.76]  I could go for the rest
[1426.76 --> 1427.28]  of this morning
[1427.28 --> 1428.58]  on how God's love
[1428.58 --> 1429.34]  throughout the biblical story
[1429.34 --> 1432.10]  is always for other people.
[1432.86 --> 1433.88]  All that he does
[1433.88 --> 1434.72]  is so that his world
[1434.72 --> 1435.44]  and his people
[1435.44 --> 1436.78]  could flourish again.
[1437.12 --> 1437.82]  All that he does
[1437.82 --> 1438.68]  is so they can understand
[1438.68 --> 1439.96]  the depth of his love
[1439.96 --> 1441.26]  and live in that love.
[1441.34 --> 1443.08]  It's always for the benefit
[1443.08 --> 1444.56]  of that other.
[1445.44 --> 1446.12]  And so it must be
[1446.12 --> 1446.70]  with the church
[1446.70 --> 1448.62]  that we are a community
[1448.62 --> 1450.80]  that is deeply for one another,
[1451.10 --> 1451.88]  that our actions,
[1452.56 --> 1453.34]  our words,
[1453.66 --> 1454.36]  our intentions
[1454.36 --> 1456.60]  are for them growing in Christ.
[1457.22 --> 1457.84]  And I'm convinced
[1457.84 --> 1459.00]  that people do not join
[1459.00 --> 1459.38]  churches,
[1460.22 --> 1460.88]  if those churches
[1460.88 --> 1461.88]  do not demonstrate
[1461.88 --> 1463.62]  a love that is deeply
[1463.62 --> 1464.64]  for them.
[1465.18 --> 1465.80]  If there's a sense
[1465.80 --> 1466.40]  in which we want to
[1466.40 --> 1467.86]  use people to some
[1467.86 --> 1468.84]  churchy end
[1468.84 --> 1469.50]  or if we're going to,
[1469.88 --> 1470.88]  there's some other motive
[1470.88 --> 1472.30]  at work in that relationship,
[1472.40 --> 1473.28]  it's not going anywhere.
[1473.92 --> 1475.16]  Biblical love is for.
[1475.56 --> 1476.16]  It's committed,
[1476.38 --> 1476.90]  it's present,
[1476.96 --> 1477.76]  and it is for.
[1479.68 --> 1480.80]  And Jesus says
[1480.80 --> 1482.04]  to the church in Ephesus,
[1482.92 --> 1483.32]  repent
[1483.32 --> 1485.88]  and return to the love
[1485.88 --> 1486.56]  you once had
[1486.56 --> 1487.12]  for one another.
[1487.18 --> 1488.12]  And there's a recognition
[1488.12 --> 1489.48]  that Jesus shows them.
[1489.92 --> 1490.92]  You used to love
[1490.92 --> 1491.66]  one another more.
[1492.28 --> 1493.18]  You used to live
[1493.18 --> 1493.68]  in that love.
[1493.70 --> 1494.34]  And you can imagine
[1494.34 --> 1495.04]  perhaps when they
[1495.04 --> 1495.96]  were coming to faith
[1495.96 --> 1496.80]  and they were just
[1496.80 --> 1497.42]  starting to gather
[1497.42 --> 1497.84]  as a community,
[1497.90 --> 1498.70]  there was that love.
[1499.14 --> 1499.30]  I mean,
[1499.34 --> 1500.10]  I've even heard
[1500.10 --> 1501.20]  when hope was planted,
[1501.28 --> 1501.86]  there is like this
[1501.86 --> 1503.42]  zeal among one another,
[1503.52 --> 1505.22]  this shared excitement
[1505.22 --> 1506.60]  and ambition together,
[1506.74 --> 1507.82]  this love for the city
[1507.82 --> 1509.04]  that compelled people
[1509.04 --> 1509.92]  to plant this church.
[1510.54 --> 1510.78]  Right?
[1511.44 --> 1512.50]  But it's easy
[1512.50 --> 1514.50]  as churches go on,
[1514.50 --> 1515.42]  especially in Ephesus
[1515.42 --> 1516.16]  where there's pressure,
[1516.32 --> 1517.14]  there's different groups
[1517.14 --> 1518.04]  competing for power.
[1518.30 --> 1519.84]  It's easy to lose
[1519.84 --> 1520.60]  that love
[1520.60 --> 1522.42]  and to get to know
[1522.42 --> 1523.38]  the people in your church.
[1523.44 --> 1523.62]  You're like,
[1523.70 --> 1523.96]  whoa,
[1524.28 --> 1524.98]  I didn't sign up
[1524.98 --> 1526.30]  to be with these people
[1526.30 --> 1527.30]  and to be present
[1527.30 --> 1528.02]  with those people
[1528.02 --> 1528.42]  and they're saying
[1528.42 --> 1529.42]  the same thing about you.
[1530.08 --> 1531.28]  And like a good marriage,
[1531.88 --> 1532.54]  it's often like
[1532.54 --> 1533.82]  it starts with this excitement,
[1533.92 --> 1534.64]  this sense of real,
[1534.78 --> 1535.82]  deep, shared love,
[1535.84 --> 1537.02]  and then it kind of fades
[1537.02 --> 1538.78]  as life goes on.
[1539.52 --> 1540.52]  And Jesus' words isn't,
[1540.64 --> 1541.26]  well, you tried
[1541.26 --> 1541.90]  and you failed,
[1542.02 --> 1543.00]  so just move on.
[1543.40 --> 1544.04]  Maybe try to find
[1544.04 --> 1544.86]  another church
[1544.86 --> 1546.64]  that suited your taste
[1546.64 --> 1547.06]  a little more.
[1547.14 --> 1547.90]  Jesus' words are,
[1548.20 --> 1550.46]  repent and do the things
[1550.46 --> 1551.30]  you did at the beginning.
[1551.92 --> 1552.92]  Turn to one another.
[1553.04 --> 1553.30]  I mean,
[1553.70 --> 1555.08]  this is a huge ask.
[1555.86 --> 1556.78]  What a huge ask.
[1557.44 --> 1558.26]  It's saying to the church,
[1558.52 --> 1559.36]  I know it's hard.
[1559.62 --> 1560.94]  I know you lack love,
[1561.14 --> 1562.26]  but now it's time to repent
[1562.26 --> 1564.00]  and to learn how to love
[1564.00 --> 1564.80]  your brothers and sisters
[1564.80 --> 1565.36]  in the church.
[1566.56 --> 1568.22]  And Jesus never commands
[1568.22 --> 1570.02]  anything that is impossible.
[1570.96 --> 1572.10]  Jesus never asks the church
[1572.10 --> 1573.64]  something that is well beyond
[1573.64 --> 1575.02]  able for them to do.
[1575.84 --> 1576.44]  And when I say that,
[1576.50 --> 1577.54]  I mean by his power,
[1577.70 --> 1578.44]  through his spirit.
[1579.00 --> 1580.02]  Jesus would never command them
[1580.02 --> 1580.74]  something that's impossible.
[1580.84 --> 1581.82]  He knows that this is a church
[1581.82 --> 1583.36]  that can live in love again.
[1583.64 --> 1585.10]  They can learn to be the community
[1585.10 --> 1585.96]  that demonstrates the love
[1585.96 --> 1586.92]  of Jesus to the world.
[1587.50 --> 1588.10]  It says, repent
[1588.10 --> 1590.18]  and do the things you did
[1590.18 --> 1590.76]  at first.
[1591.56 --> 1592.26]  And I'm convinced,
[1592.40 --> 1592.58]  I mean,
[1592.62 --> 1593.34]  I could spend a lot of time
[1593.34 --> 1593.76]  on this too,
[1593.84 --> 1595.04]  but for this to happen,
[1595.68 --> 1596.84]  I'm convinced it goes,
[1597.04 --> 1597.64]  it brings them back
[1597.64 --> 1598.26]  to the basics.
[1599.36 --> 1600.66]  The basics are
[1600.66 --> 1602.30]  remembering what brought them
[1602.30 --> 1603.36]  together in the first place.
[1604.30 --> 1606.04]  The basics are what defines them
[1606.04 --> 1606.84]  as the church.
[1607.40 --> 1608.02]  What is that?
[1609.28 --> 1610.24]  It's the cross.
[1612.18 --> 1613.86]  Basics are centering their hearts,
[1613.98 --> 1614.48]  their lives,
[1614.56 --> 1615.16]  their minds
[1615.16 --> 1616.60]  on Jesus.
[1619.18 --> 1620.92]  In Paul's letter to Ephesus,
[1621.56 --> 1623.26]  one of my favorite letters
[1623.26 --> 1623.78]  in the Bible,
[1623.78 --> 1626.20]  Paul prays for the church.
[1627.02 --> 1627.94]  And I'm struck by
[1627.94 --> 1629.84]  how Paul uses these words
[1629.84 --> 1630.58]  in his prayer.
[1630.70 --> 1630.94]  He says,
[1631.02 --> 1632.42]  and I pray that you,
[1633.30 --> 1633.96]  being rooted
[1633.96 --> 1635.72]  and established in love,
[1636.24 --> 1637.72]  may have power together
[1637.72 --> 1639.90]  with all of God's people
[1639.90 --> 1641.96]  to grasp how high
[1641.96 --> 1643.12]  and wide and long
[1643.12 --> 1644.66]  and deep is the love of Christ
[1644.66 --> 1646.18]  and to know that this love
[1646.18 --> 1647.68]  surpasses knowledge
[1647.68 --> 1649.22]  that you may be filled
[1649.22 --> 1649.84]  to the measure
[1649.84 --> 1652.36]  of all the fullness of God.
[1652.36 --> 1654.64]  Oh, to be that church.
[1656.42 --> 1657.28]  And Paul's prayer
[1657.28 --> 1658.16]  is that the believers
[1658.16 --> 1660.20]  fix their eyes,
[1660.36 --> 1660.96]  their hearts,
[1661.60 --> 1662.16]  and minds
[1662.16 --> 1662.96]  on Jesus.
[1664.02 --> 1665.20]  And there's nothing
[1665.20 --> 1666.20]  that humbles believers
[1666.20 --> 1667.64]  like Jesus.
[1668.42 --> 1668.94]  There's nothing
[1668.94 --> 1669.84]  that humbles believers
[1669.84 --> 1671.10]  like the cross
[1671.10 --> 1672.06]  where God
[1672.06 --> 1673.22]  in His infinite love
[1673.22 --> 1674.20]  gives Jesus
[1674.20 --> 1675.32]  who gives up His life.
[1675.44 --> 1675.68]  Why?
[1675.84 --> 1676.60]  For us.
[1677.10 --> 1678.00]  People in rebellion.
[1678.14 --> 1678.78]  For a world
[1678.78 --> 1679.80]  broken by sin.
[1680.54 --> 1681.14]  And when believers
[1681.14 --> 1681.90]  take that in
[1681.90 --> 1682.48]  in Ephesus
[1682.48 --> 1683.80]  and here in Surrey
[1683.80 --> 1684.50]  at Hope Community Church,
[1684.54 --> 1685.96]  when we really take in
[1685.96 --> 1686.82]  the fact that Jesus
[1686.82 --> 1688.40]  gave up His life
[1688.40 --> 1690.06]  for rebellious people,
[1690.86 --> 1691.26]  us,
[1692.06 --> 1693.46]  it gives us the capacity
[1693.46 --> 1694.26]  to love
[1694.26 --> 1695.88]  those who are hard to love
[1695.88 --> 1697.16]  and receive love
[1697.16 --> 1698.80]  when we are hard to love.
[1699.52 --> 1700.26]  That humility
[1700.26 --> 1701.12]  before Jesus
[1701.12 --> 1702.42]  is central
[1702.42 --> 1703.32]  to being the community
[1703.32 --> 1703.82]  of love.
[1704.74 --> 1705.38]  I remember reading
[1705.38 --> 1705.94]  a book by
[1705.94 --> 1708.22]  Jack something.
[1708.42 --> 1708.82]  I'm forgetting
[1708.82 --> 1709.50]  his last name.
[1709.50 --> 1710.68]  But it's a book
[1710.68 --> 1711.56]  written to leaders
[1711.56 --> 1712.90]  and over and over again
[1712.90 --> 1713.50]  I was struck by
[1713.50 --> 1714.10]  how His advice
[1714.10 --> 1715.16]  to leaders in the church,
[1715.28 --> 1716.38]  elders, deacons, pastors,
[1716.90 --> 1718.06]  is focus your hearts
[1718.06 --> 1718.72]  on the cross
[1718.72 --> 1720.58]  because when you are humble
[1720.58 --> 1722.00]  you can lead faithfully.
[1722.80 --> 1723.76]  When you are proud
[1723.76 --> 1724.50]  you will destroy
[1724.50 --> 1725.44]  the unity of the church.
[1725.50 --> 1726.28]  But when you are humbled
[1726.28 --> 1726.98]  by the cross
[1726.98 --> 1728.04]  and what Jesus has done
[1728.04 --> 1728.54]  for His church
[1728.54 --> 1729.28]  and for you,
[1729.96 --> 1731.08]  you will be in the right position
[1731.08 --> 1732.46]  to love the body of Christ,
[1732.56 --> 1733.62]  His broken bride.
[1734.34 --> 1735.38]  It starts with being humbled
[1735.38 --> 1736.12]  by the cross.
[1736.12 --> 1739.76]  Jesus finishes His words
[1739.76 --> 1740.24]  to the church
[1740.24 --> 1741.12]  with an invitation
[1741.12 --> 1742.78]  to heed His words
[1742.78 --> 1743.66]  and hopeful promise.
[1743.76 --> 1744.44]  We hear Him say
[1744.44 --> 1745.24]  at the end of this letter,
[1745.34 --> 1747.14]  whoever has ears to hear,
[1748.06 --> 1748.80]  let them hear
[1748.80 --> 1749.70]  what the Spirit says
[1749.70 --> 1750.30]  to the churches.
[1750.98 --> 1752.26]  To those who are victorious,
[1752.40 --> 1753.16]  I will give you
[1753.16 --> 1754.00]  the right to eat
[1754.00 --> 1755.04]  from the tree of life
[1755.04 --> 1756.90]  which is in the paradise
[1756.90 --> 1757.82]  of God.
[1759.86 --> 1760.74]  The promise
[1760.74 --> 1761.68]  that Jesus gives
[1761.68 --> 1762.50]  to the church in Ephesus
[1762.50 --> 1763.54]  is paradise.
[1764.56 --> 1764.92]  If you know
[1764.92 --> 1765.66]  the biblical story,
[1765.76 --> 1767.48]  it begins with paradise.
[1767.80 --> 1769.00]  What happens in Genesis 3?
[1769.54 --> 1770.18]  Adam and Eve
[1770.18 --> 1770.68]  are banished
[1770.68 --> 1771.84]  from the garden of paradise.
[1771.98 --> 1772.70]  They ate from the tree
[1772.70 --> 1773.42]  and they're banished
[1773.42 --> 1773.82]  from the garden.
[1774.02 --> 1775.82]  How does Revelation 21 end?
[1776.52 --> 1778.20]  With paradise restored.
[1778.38 --> 1778.92]  And that paradise
[1778.92 --> 1780.04]  is not just a little garden,
[1780.14 --> 1781.16]  it is the whole creation.
[1782.22 --> 1783.18]  And Jesus is saying
[1783.18 --> 1784.90]  to those who have ears to hear,
[1785.14 --> 1786.10]  to those who repent
[1786.10 --> 1787.66]  and live in His love,
[1788.18 --> 1789.20]  you will share
[1789.20 --> 1790.72]  in that paradise.
[1792.04 --> 1793.12]  You will live
[1793.12 --> 1793.76]  in the garden
[1793.76 --> 1795.18]  of God's good creation.
[1796.00 --> 1797.36]  You will enjoy
[1797.36 --> 1798.82]  the loving presence
[1798.82 --> 1801.18]  of God forever.
[1804.48 --> 1805.14]  So Hope,
[1805.20 --> 1806.04]  my question to us
[1806.04 --> 1807.20]  is do we have ears to hear?
[1808.94 --> 1809.74]  Do we hear
[1809.74 --> 1810.30]  what the Spirit
[1810.30 --> 1811.18]  is saying to us
[1811.18 --> 1811.78]  this morning
[1811.78 --> 1813.10]  as we listen
[1813.10 --> 1813.94]  to Jesus' words
[1813.94 --> 1814.92]  to the church in Ephesus?
[1815.36 --> 1816.50]  There is a lot here
[1816.50 --> 1817.28]  for our church,
[1817.50 --> 1819.50]  both in the commendations
[1819.50 --> 1821.02]  and in the challenges.
[1822.38 --> 1822.64]  You know,
[1822.68 --> 1823.44]  I was trying to tease
[1823.44 --> 1823.82]  out of Brittany,
[1823.90 --> 1824.36]  my wife,
[1824.46 --> 1824.98]  where she thinks
[1824.98 --> 1826.24]  we land in that balance
[1826.24 --> 1827.18]  of sort of the faithfulness
[1827.18 --> 1827.58]  to teaching
[1827.58 --> 1828.08]  and the loving.
[1828.18 --> 1828.40]  She's like,
[1828.44 --> 1829.10]  we probably lean
[1829.10 --> 1829.74]  a little bit more
[1829.74 --> 1830.28]  to loving
[1830.28 --> 1831.24]  and a little bit more
[1831.24 --> 1832.20]  relaxed on teaching,
[1832.44 --> 1833.54]  but are we the church
[1833.54 --> 1834.78]  that will pursue
[1834.78 --> 1835.64]  faithful teaching
[1835.64 --> 1837.52]  and be discerning
[1837.52 --> 1838.32]  with our leaders
[1838.32 --> 1840.20]  such that Jesus says,
[1840.30 --> 1841.36]  you are honoring me
[1841.36 --> 1842.72]  and you are honoring
[1842.72 --> 1843.16]  what it means
[1843.16 --> 1843.74]  to be the church
[1843.74 --> 1844.48]  in your decisions
[1844.48 --> 1845.92]  and your teaching
[1845.92 --> 1847.44]  and your biblical preaching
[1847.44 --> 1849.10]  and your leadership training
[1849.10 --> 1849.74]  and all the rest.
[1849.84 --> 1850.94]  Will you be faithful in that?
[1852.38 --> 1856.12]  And will you live in love?
[1857.96 --> 1858.58]  I'm convinced
[1858.58 --> 1859.70]  that it is a distinct work
[1859.70 --> 1860.12]  of the Spirit,
[1860.26 --> 1861.26]  even in our church,
[1861.38 --> 1862.80]  to bring these together
[1862.80 --> 1864.32]  and fuse them.
[1865.56 --> 1866.92]  Oh, how beautiful it would be
[1866.92 --> 1867.52]  for new people
[1867.52 --> 1868.16]  who come into church
[1868.16 --> 1868.38]  and say,
[1868.52 --> 1869.36]  wow, I can tell
[1869.36 --> 1870.80]  that this is a community
[1870.80 --> 1871.50]  that is filled
[1871.50 --> 1872.44]  with the love of the Spirit.
[1873.08 --> 1874.12]  That the love of Jesus
[1874.12 --> 1874.94]  is just present
[1874.94 --> 1875.60]  in the interaction
[1875.60 --> 1876.60]  and the justice
[1876.60 --> 1877.30]  and the joy
[1877.30 --> 1877.86]  and the speaking
[1877.86 --> 1878.38]  and the acting.
[1878.52 --> 1878.96]  It's present.
[1879.42 --> 1880.84]  And it's also a church
[1880.84 --> 1882.66]  that is so devoted
[1882.66 --> 1884.48]  to biblical teaching.
[1886.12 --> 1887.36]  That's my kind of church.
[1888.26 --> 1888.88]  And let me finish
[1888.88 --> 1889.74]  by reading again
[1889.74 --> 1890.90]  Jesus' words
[1890.90 --> 1891.96]  to his disciples
[1891.96 --> 1893.04]  in John 13.
[1893.22 --> 1893.66]  He says,
[1894.10 --> 1894.96]  a new command
[1894.96 --> 1896.10]  I give to you,
[1897.00 --> 1898.72]  love one another.
[1899.58 --> 1900.18]  By this,
[1900.48 --> 1901.60]  everyone will know
[1901.60 --> 1903.18]  that you are my disciples,
[1903.32 --> 1904.04]  brothers and sisters,
[1904.04 --> 1905.32]  if we love.
[1905.32 --> 1906.48]  one another.
[1906.70 --> 1907.14]  Let's pray.
[1910.14 --> 1911.02]  Father, we thank you
[1911.02 --> 1911.62]  for these scriptures.
[1912.78 --> 1913.60]  We thank you
[1913.60 --> 1914.60]  for our brothers and sisters
[1914.60 --> 1915.70]  who have gone before us
[1915.70 --> 1916.36]  in Ephesus
[1916.36 --> 1917.84]  and Smyrna
[1917.84 --> 1919.22]  and Pergamum.
[1919.90 --> 1920.86]  For our brothers and sisters
[1920.86 --> 1921.38]  in China
[1921.38 --> 1922.12]  and around the world,
[1922.24 --> 1922.36]  Lord,
[1922.40 --> 1923.56]  who seek to live
[1923.56 --> 1924.52]  as disciples
[1924.52 --> 1925.70]  faithful to your word
[1925.70 --> 1926.64]  and faithful
[1926.64 --> 1927.52]  to the love of Jesus.
[1928.26 --> 1929.48]  I ask that your spirit
[1929.48 --> 1930.32]  would be poured out
[1930.32 --> 1931.42]  on our church this morning,
[1931.92 --> 1932.76]  in our homes,
[1932.76 --> 1933.52]  in our families,
[1933.76 --> 1934.50]  wherever we are,
[1934.58 --> 1935.72]  that we would be the people
[1935.72 --> 1937.66]  rooted in the love of Jesus,
[1937.86 --> 1938.44]  that we would know
[1938.44 --> 1938.88]  the depth,
[1939.02 --> 1939.28]  the width,
[1939.34 --> 1940.44]  the height of his love,
[1940.50 --> 1941.50]  and that it would fill us
[1941.50 --> 1943.40]  to the fullness of God.
[1945.04 --> 1945.46]  Father,
[1945.54 --> 1946.30]  make us faithful
[1946.30 --> 1947.04]  to the challenges
[1947.04 --> 1947.80]  of our city.
[1948.68 --> 1949.62]  Make us faithful
[1949.62 --> 1950.76]  to whatever false teaching
[1950.76 --> 1952.12]  may come to our community.
[1953.12 --> 1954.70]  Give us discerning ears,
[1955.46 --> 1956.44]  discerning hearts,
[1957.08 --> 1957.86]  sharp minds
[1957.86 --> 1959.06]  to see what is happening,
[1959.06 --> 1960.76]  to see what's going
[1960.76 --> 1961.94]  behind the scenes,
[1962.20 --> 1963.04]  that we would be
[1963.04 --> 1963.74]  faithful witnesses
[1963.74 --> 1964.62]  in this time,
[1965.18 --> 1966.00]  in this place,
[1966.44 --> 1967.14]  to the lordship
[1967.14 --> 1968.00]  of Jesus Christ.
[1968.76 --> 1969.00]  Amen.
[1971.48 --> 1972.64]  I invite you to stand
[1972.64 --> 1973.30]  in your homes
[1973.30 --> 1973.88]  and join me
[1973.88 --> 1975.28]  in a song of response.
[1975.50 --> 1976.72]  Build my life.
[1976.76 --> 1977.34]  And there's a phrase
[1977.34 --> 1977.96]  in that song
[1977.96 --> 1978.62]  that I just love.
[1978.70 --> 1980.58]  It's lead me in your love
[1980.58 --> 1982.18]  to those around me.
[1982.22 --> 1982.94]  Let's sing together.
[1982.94 --> 1982.98]  Let's sing together.
[1982.98 --> 1983.02]  Let's sing together.
