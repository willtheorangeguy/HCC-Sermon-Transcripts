[0.00 --> 8.36]  well good morning hope it's a gift to gather around the scriptures again this week this morning
[8.36 --> 12.94]  we're going to be looking at the way in which we're called to serve our vulnerable neighbors
[12.94 --> 18.28]  this morning and you should know this is a makeup sermon for pastor sid he was supposed to preach on
[18.28 --> 22.64]  this two weeks ago but he didn't he preached instead on our own brokenness and the way in
[22.64 --> 26.78]  which we're called to deal with our own hearts and how god invites us to serve in our brokenness
[26.78 --> 30.78]  and we forgive him because it was an amazing sermon and if you haven't listened to it i do
[30.78 --> 35.54]  commend it to you it was it was a word and season for all of us but this morning we're looking at
[35.54 --> 40.10]  the way in which we are called to serve our brothers and sisters who are vulnerable and so for that i
[40.10 --> 44.82]  invite you to turn with me to luke chapter 7 we're going to look at a story of hospitality
[44.82 --> 50.10]  it says luke chapter 7 verse 36 so if you have your bible or your phone scroll with me or turn with
[50.10 --> 51.10]  me to that passage
[51.10 --> 64.68]  when one of the pharisees invited jesus to have dinner with him he went to the pharisee's house
[64.68 --> 70.58]  and reclined at the table a woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that jesus was eating
[70.58 --> 77.14]  at the pharisee's house so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume as she stood behind him at his
[77.14 --> 83.86]  feet weeping she began to wet his feet with her tears and she wiped them with her hair kissed them
[83.86 --> 90.42]  and poured perfume on them when the pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself
[90.42 --> 96.26]  if this man were a prophet he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is
[96.26 --> 104.18]  that she is a sinner jesus answered him simon i have something to tell you tell me teacher he said
[104.18 --> 111.08]  two people owed money to a certain money lender one owed him 500 denarii and the other 50 neither
[111.08 --> 116.06]  of them had the money to pay him back so he forgave the debts of both now which of them will love him
[116.06 --> 123.02]  more simon replied i suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven you've judged correctly jesus said
[123.02 --> 130.02]  then he turned towards the woman and said to simon do you see this woman i came into your house
[130.02 --> 134.98]  you did not give me any water for my feet but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her
[134.98 --> 140.60]  hair you did not give me a kiss but this woman from the time i entered has not stopped kissing my feet
[140.60 --> 146.94]  you did not put oil on my head but she has poured perfume on my feet therefore i tell you her many
[146.94 --> 152.96]  sins have been forgiven as her great love has shown but whoever has been been forgiven little
[152.96 --> 162.26]  loves little and jesus said to her your sins are forgiven the other guests began to say among
[162.26 --> 171.86]  themselves who is this who even forgives sins jesus said to the woman your faith has saved you go in peace
[171.86 --> 182.96]  well not that long ago there's a conference a christian conference and the speaker was asked
[182.96 --> 187.66]  to give a 30-minute talk on justice and the way in which the church is called to serve the poor the
[187.66 --> 193.56]  margins of society and he began that conference with a very vivid illustration he brought with him a bible
[193.56 --> 197.96]  but it wasn't just a bible that looked like this it was very tattered you could tell there's something
[197.96 --> 203.56]  different about it as he sort of flipped through the pages it was obvious that there was a lot missing
[203.56 --> 208.50]  and then there's pages that bent there's pages that were missing and obviously there's something
[208.50 --> 214.74]  going on and he said before i came to this conference to speak on this i went through my bible and i cut out
[214.74 --> 221.66]  and ripped out every verse that talks about justice every verse that talks about god's love for the poor
[221.66 --> 227.70]  every verse about the oppressed the marginalized the people that jesus loves and invites the church to
[227.70 --> 233.28]  serve i ripped out every passage around that and he held up this bible that was in tatters
[233.28 --> 243.22]  and basically said if we don't concern ourselves and serve the margins of society we are not reading
[243.22 --> 250.78]  the bible or i would put it differently perhaps we're reading it and we're not hearing it i'm convinced
[250.78 --> 257.38]  that if all we had were the gospel accounts matthew or mark or luke specifically luke you cannot read
[257.38 --> 263.12]  through just the gospel account without realizing that jesus gave so much of his time which was a
[263.12 --> 269.42]  precious commodity in his kingdom ministry he gave so much of that time to the poor to the outsiders
[269.42 --> 276.68]  to those that common society would avoid neglect not think about jesus was there on the margins and so
[276.68 --> 284.92]  much of what he did was listen to them speak with them protect them break bread with them share his
[284.92 --> 291.80]  ministry in his life with them invite them into his life and forgive them invite them to be his followers
[291.80 --> 298.66]  to invite them to be his kingdom citizens this is jesus ministry i mean robert karis who wrote a whole
[298.66 --> 305.66]  book on jesus meals in the gospel he said jesus got killed because of who he ate with he got killed because
[305.66 --> 310.78]  of who he ate with he ate with all the wrong people all the outsiders well all the insiders like the pharisees
[310.78 --> 316.52]  said this guy's not safe this guy's dangerous because he was so willing to be at the margins and
[316.52 --> 321.68]  stay there and serve there and love the people there that he made the people in power uncomfortable
[321.68 --> 329.86]  i want to ask the question at the outset could the same be said of jesus church today
[329.86 --> 335.78]  it is true that if you look through our church history there's a beautiful glorious tradition
[335.78 --> 341.16]  of the church being right on the front and center of where the pain is where the hardship is where the
[341.16 --> 346.38]  vulnerable people live can that still be said of the church specifically in the west specifically in
[346.38 --> 355.76]  canada maybe even our own city does hope community have the reputation of loving and serving our
[355.76 --> 356.74]  vulnerable neighbors
[356.74 --> 364.82]  luke 7 is a masterful story in fact it's the kind of passage that you could preach multiple sermons on
[364.82 --> 369.14]  and we're going to walk through it slowly today but i want to just recognize that this story starts
[369.14 --> 376.12]  with jesus being invited as a guest and then in comes another uninvited guests that the host of the
[376.12 --> 381.08]  meal does not welcome she is not welcome to this meal but jesus welcomes her and it creates this very
[381.08 --> 386.44]  tense awkward situation with the people who invited jesus but it forces some really interesting questions
[386.44 --> 387.76]  about hospitality like
[387.76 --> 389.86]  who's welcome in our tables
[389.86 --> 394.64]  who are the people we're okay being around with who are we not comfortable
[394.64 --> 398.34]  sharing meals with sharing life with breaking bread with
[398.34 --> 402.08]  luke 7 sort of forces some good hard questions on the church
[402.08 --> 403.74]  today about our hospitality
[403.74 --> 409.18]  but it starts with a pharisee whose name we only learn later when jesus speaks is simon
[409.18 --> 414.92]  and in all likelihood simon had power simon was wealthy he probably had a bigger home that he can invite people in to have a meal with
[414.92 --> 418.94]  and it's in this meal with a reclining perhaps to learn about jesus perhaps to
[418.94 --> 423.54]  see what they think about jesus it's then that this uninvited guest comes
[423.54 --> 428.74]  this uninvited woman comes and this woman isn't even given a name
[428.74 --> 432.40]  we know very little about her she doesn't have a name what we do know is it said twice
[432.40 --> 435.38]  this is a woman who lives quote a sinful life
[435.38 --> 439.84]  and commentators are almost unanimous on this one where that sinful life is
[439.84 --> 445.10]  prostitution it's the sex trade it's that woman who does that thing for a living
[445.10 --> 449.92]  that woman who people might gossip about around the city about that area of her work and employment
[449.92 --> 453.20]  and she's the one who comes to see jesus
[453.20 --> 459.22]  and it's striking because there's a lot of if i had more time i'd talk about these there's boundaries on hospitality
[459.22 --> 467.24]  in the early churches or sorry in the jewish world then especially in the city the pharisees would have a sense of who's welcome at the table who's not welcome at the table
[467.24 --> 473.50]  who are the people they can safely eat a meal with who are quote-unquote pure and who are the outsiders who are not welcome who are impure the gentiles
[473.50 --> 480.66]  and now it's in this scene at the home of a pharisee a leader of the jewish community this woman barges in
[480.66 --> 488.68]  and she's looking for jesus and she cares not one bit about all the rules that she's breaking hard and fast
[488.68 --> 494.02]  so that she can see jesus she knows he's there she's learned his location and she no longer cares
[494.02 --> 498.90]  that there's all these pharisees these men of power in the jewish community who are going to judge her hard
[498.90 --> 502.74]  even when i imagine her coming and standing behind jesus
[502.74 --> 506.60]  i can imagine the blood pressure rising around this table
[506.60 --> 509.76]  i mean think about this just imagine for a moment this is your home
[509.76 --> 514.58]  and this woman shows up in your home she's standing behind a guest you invite it
[514.58 --> 518.10]  i can picture some of the men around the table just kind of
[518.10 --> 522.34]  this is awkward what are we going to do
[522.34 --> 528.14]  but jesus doesn't do that jesus doesn't even say like a nice polite statement of you know what this
[528.14 --> 532.42]  isn't the time this isn't the situation we want to be in he doesn't say anything in fact the person
[532.42 --> 537.86]  who breaks the moment who breaks the silence is simon who says to himself and perhaps the people around
[537.86 --> 544.50]  the table if this man this prophet knew what was going on he'd know that this woman is a sinful
[544.50 --> 552.10]  woman that's touching him and kissing his feet and you should know just how much she breaks the
[552.10 --> 556.70]  hospitality laws i mean her being there would have been tough enough for them but she doesn't just do
[556.70 --> 560.96]  that i mean imagine this scene she's standing behind jesus and perhaps he's elevated and reclining his
[560.96 --> 566.90]  feet are beside him she's weeping right her tears are falling on jesus feet
[566.90 --> 574.80]  and she's using her hair just picture this to wipe the tears off jesus feet and then she takes
[574.80 --> 585.26]  this expensive perfume and dumps it on his feet this was unbelievably offensive to the host i mean
[585.26 --> 588.96]  this is something they couldn't even tolerate or fathom happening it would be humiliating and
[588.96 --> 595.50]  embarrassing and unthinkable to simon who invited jesus into his home or as one commentator said her even
[595.50 --> 599.68]  having her hair down would be the equivalent of someone coming into your home and undressing
[599.68 --> 605.52]  that's how much of an affront this whole scene is but jesus doesn't seem to be uncomfortable
[605.52 --> 611.50]  it's simon who expresses his discomfort and we hear so much like this woman is a sinner he would
[611.50 --> 617.92]  know this if he were a prophet clearly simon's expressing his frustration but then jesus sort of
[617.92 --> 621.70]  turns this whole conversation to a strange direction where he didn't tell a mini parable
[621.70 --> 626.04]  a very small parable and he says simon let me tell you a story about a money lender
[626.04 --> 630.60]  he lends money to these two people a lot to one person a little bit less to the other and he
[630.60 --> 634.46]  cancels the debt of both people who's going to be more grateful who's going to love the money
[634.46 --> 639.82]  lender more and simon says well it seems rhetorical the person who is given forgiven more of their debt
[639.82 --> 646.94]  is going to be more grateful and he says exactly the punch of that story is this woman is that person
[646.94 --> 654.40]  this woman has received the forgiveness and this scene some people by the way have said this scene
[654.40 --> 657.68]  is the woman sort of luring jesus and these activities are sort of her trying to get his
[657.68 --> 663.06]  attention in unhealthy ways i disagree entirely and i agree with the writers who say this woman has
[663.06 --> 667.70]  actually met jesus before and this does this happens other times in luke where jesus will encounter
[667.70 --> 673.04]  people speak to people who minister to people and they then show up later in his ministry to speak
[673.04 --> 677.26]  with him to thank him to offer the gratitude to him and that's what's happening in this story
[677.26 --> 684.24]  this woman in the only profound way she knows how to offer a lavish extravagant act of gratitude
[684.24 --> 687.96]  for lavish extravagant grace
[687.96 --> 697.62]  and the irony of this story is she sees jesus for who he is for what he has done simon
[697.62 --> 705.80]  does not see jesus for who he is and what he is doing and jesus in fact gives a lot of his attention
[705.80 --> 710.96]  not to this woman but to simon who doesn't understand what's going on before him and i want
[710.96 --> 717.04]  us to pay attention to what i think is probably my favorite verse in this passage where um jesus has
[717.04 --> 722.32]  this woman at his feet and i can imagine this being a very uncomfortable situation and as she's with at
[722.32 --> 731.42]  his feet he looks at her but speaks to simon and he's asked the question simon do you see this woman
[731.42 --> 738.12]  and he asked that question because he doesn't he doesn't see this woman he doesn't understand what's
[738.12 --> 744.16]  going on he doesn't see jesus and jesus wants to open his eyes he wants simon to see the world in a
[744.16 --> 748.60]  different lens and you need to know that simon like so many people then he lived with a very clear sense
[748.60 --> 756.06]  of this is the holy jewish community set apart in the city to be god's people and we are boundaried
[756.06 --> 762.26]  off in our practices the way of life from the secular society the gentile way of life those people out
[762.26 --> 766.84]  there there is the holy and there is the unholy the pure and the impure the insiders and the outsiders
[766.84 --> 771.58]  and jesus is just shattering his paradigms here right think about who's coming into the meal
[771.58 --> 777.32]  think about who he's extending forgiveness to and he's helping simon see that god's kingdom the one that
[777.32 --> 784.94]  he's bringing in is the upside down kingdom he's just shattering all of simon's inside outside paradigm
[784.94 --> 792.12]  he's saying this woman is welcome in my kingdom my grace extends to all these places all the vulnerable
[792.12 --> 800.52]  quote-unquote outsiders i welcome and invite to be my disciples because in jesus kingdom no one is too far
[800.52 --> 807.40]  gone no one is too weak too poor too vulnerable too far gone and whatever they're caught up in
[807.40 --> 815.74]  for his grace and simon needs to see it he needs to understand it he needs to see that the jesus who's
[815.74 --> 821.82]  before him is god's son the fullest revelation of the father's heart and the fullest revelation of
[821.82 --> 828.62]  father's heart says to this woman in this area of life who's at this meal you are forgiven
[828.62 --> 834.30]  and simon needs to learn from her how to see jesus
[834.30 --> 842.14]  tim chester who wrote a book on hospitality in the gospel of luke who also says that you know jesus main
[842.14 --> 848.52]  ministry is eating and drinking and in the gospel of luke he's just going from house to house eating here
[848.52 --> 853.04]  drinking there talking there dining there he's just eating and drinking and he talks about all
[853.04 --> 857.84]  these practices of hospitality and how it's working with the pharisees and this is what he says about
[857.84 --> 863.88]  the pharisees particularly the teachers of the law created a system that allowed them to feel superior
[863.88 --> 870.66]  and then lifted not one finger to help others then he invites us think of how this might play out today
[870.66 --> 876.32]  today's pharisees might condemn the poor for their dysfunctional families but lift not one finger to help
[876.32 --> 881.16]  today's pharisees might condemn the poor for their excessive drinking but lift not one finger to ease
[881.16 --> 886.76]  their pain today's pharisees might condemn the poor for their laziness but lift not one finger to provide
[886.76 --> 892.98]  employment today's pharisees might condemn the poor for their abortions but lift not one finger to adopt
[892.98 --> 901.06]  unwanted children we can't condemn these things at a distance that is legalism we must come alongside
[901.06 --> 906.70]  proclaiming and demonstrating the transforming grace of god
[906.70 --> 915.64]  to follow jesus to serve like jesus to wash the feet of the world like jesus is to follow him into
[915.64 --> 923.08]  all these places brokenness and messiness and vulnerability and weakness and be comfortable
[923.08 --> 927.62]  there i'm struck by how there's so much discomfort in this story the more i read i just think man these
[927.62 --> 931.28]  pharisees must have been just so triggered by everything that's happening but jesus lived so
[931.28 --> 936.80]  well in that space he was not uncomfortable in fact as chester goes on to say he says jesus is
[936.80 --> 942.64]  remembered and criticized for being a friend of the sinners a friend of the outsiders the one who
[942.64 --> 947.44]  welcomes the tax collectors the one who invites to faith the roman centurion in just a few chapters
[947.44 --> 953.34]  prior and he's the one who sits and extends forgiveness to this woman he writes he's a friend of
[953.34 --> 958.30]  sinners he's not embarrassed by them he's a friend of the riffraff the traitors the drunks the druggies
[958.30 --> 964.02]  the prostitutes the mentally ill the broken and the needy that's his posture and let me ask again
[964.02 --> 972.48]  is that what we're known for is that our posture is that the reputation hope community church has in our
[972.48 --> 972.82]  city
[972.82 --> 981.70]  christine pole who's a professor at asbury seminary she wrote a fair bit on hospitality as well and
[981.70 --> 986.76]  some of her work is just amazing and this is just a quote i pulled out of her book that relates very
[986.76 --> 992.76]  deeply to what we're talking about she writes often we maintain significant boundaries which is precisely
[992.76 --> 998.32]  what the pharisees were doing when offering help to persons in need many churches prepare and serve
[998.32 --> 1004.00]  meals to hungry neighbors but few church members find it easy to sit and eat with those who need the
[1004.00 --> 1009.70]  meal when there are people who are very different from ourselves we often find it more comfortable to
[1009.70 --> 1015.64]  cook and clean for them than share in a meal and a conversation we're familiar with the roles as
[1015.64 --> 1023.60]  helpers but are less certain about being equals together eating together many of us struggle with
[1023.60 --> 1032.34]  simply being present with people in need i really like that quote i find it very convicting personally
[1032.34 --> 1038.10]  because jesus was not just interested in charity this passage is not about hey if you just give to this
[1038.10 --> 1042.22]  cause and help these people over there and you kind of say at arm's length that's what we're after
[1042.22 --> 1046.68]  and that's not what we're after and yes generosity is really important giving to causes is really
[1046.68 --> 1052.26]  important but jesus sort of gets close i mean in the whole gospel of luke jesus constantly getting
[1052.26 --> 1058.00]  close to the weak the poor the disadvantaged the marginalized he touches the lepers he doesn't have to
[1058.00 --> 1062.98]  do that he touches them he breaks bread with them he's with this woman and this woman is close to him
[1062.98 --> 1070.58]  the ministry of jesus is one of getting close moving from charity to kinship from being just helping out
[1070.58 --> 1077.76]  here and there to being with and for i think the church has so much to learn from jesus ministry on
[1077.76 --> 1082.20]  being close and sharing life with our vulnerable neighbors
[1082.20 --> 1089.06]  one of the things i've loved about the cloverdale community kitchen i know many of us serve there
[1089.06 --> 1093.54]  throughout the week at least pre-covid we were allowed to do this where you know people would
[1093.54 --> 1097.90]  make good meals one of the things i love about the cck is they don't just make sort of meals that are
[1097.90 --> 1101.40]  donated that are secondary meals you wouldn't feed your family but they're good meals and i've always
[1101.40 --> 1106.80]  appreciated that and then they share that meal with everybody who comes and i love how you know
[1106.80 --> 1109.70]  there's people in our church serving in the kitchen getting everything ready setting the tables
[1109.70 --> 1114.76]  then all the guests come and we sit around those tables and then i find around the meal what happens is
[1114.76 --> 1120.54]  you're not just like giving this meal you're asking about each other's names you're learning
[1120.54 --> 1124.58]  each other's stories and i find so often you look around the room as people are sharing the meal
[1124.58 --> 1129.62]  there's prayer happening and there's that sense of now we're with each other now we're in relationship
[1129.62 --> 1136.22]  with one another we're getting close to one another in the way of christ that is the ministry of jesus
[1136.22 --> 1145.32]  now it needs to be emphasized that not everyone is called to the same kind of ministry or the same
[1145.32 --> 1150.40]  areas of vulnerable pain right there are people in our church and people in the past in our church
[1150.40 --> 1155.26]  even who've gotten involved in street ministry and involved with the lives of people in the sex trade
[1155.26 --> 1159.86]  in fact just last week i got to know about a ministry called servants anonymous and there's someone
[1159.86 --> 1163.42]  who's connected to our community is doing really good work and just i'm learning a lot from him about
[1163.42 --> 1169.30]  how we serve in those ways and how churches can participate but there's a whole host of ways that
[1169.30 --> 1175.78]  god gives us opportunity and he gives us a desire to serve in fact in surge we talk about this we
[1175.78 --> 1179.62]  often ask the question where's the burden that god's placed in your heart who are the people where
[1179.62 --> 1184.42]  you're like oh god i have to do something here this is just such a deep burden to my life this is
[1184.42 --> 1190.18]  an area of brokenness that i want to walk into and be a servant within and in our church you know i'm
[1190.18 --> 1194.04]  encouraged to see over the years okay these are the burdens that people have this is how they're
[1194.04 --> 1199.68]  acting on them it encourages me you know i think of those who on a weekly basis they're visiting
[1199.68 --> 1206.18]  vulnerable seniors who are isolated who don't have family in town going out for meals being present to
[1206.18 --> 1212.54]  them i think of those in our church who spend time with those who are in prison on the phone week after
[1212.54 --> 1218.62]  week writing letters otherwise and being present and helping in any way behind the scenes for that person
[1218.62 --> 1223.92]  who is in a tough space in a tough place think of those who are involved in recovery ministry and i
[1223.92 --> 1229.94]  know that even on wednesday nights we have our aa here in the fireside room think of those who open
[1229.94 --> 1236.02]  their homes so generously to international students to foster children who need a family for a season
[1236.02 --> 1240.86]  while their parents get healthy think of those who are involved in our refugee sponsorship saying hey
[1240.86 --> 1246.60]  this is a way i can help i can do all this hard administrative work so a family fleeing war and disaster
[1246.60 --> 1251.12]  can set up home in safety and get to know our community
[1251.12 --> 1255.74]  i think of those of you who serve very quietly behind the scenes
[1255.74 --> 1261.32]  people children and adults with disabilities and try to give a break to people who are going through a
[1261.32 --> 1264.20]  tough time with their family members who are really struggling in this season
[1264.20 --> 1270.88]  these are just a few ways and there are so many more whether it's with family or friends at school i mean
[1270.88 --> 1275.20]  some of my favorite stories are always students in the hallway or students in the classroom who see
[1275.20 --> 1280.80]  the need they see that other student their age or younger and they say that's someone i can befriend
[1280.80 --> 1287.06]  that's someone i can share meals with that's someone i can bring into my life so they can experience a
[1287.06 --> 1289.40]  love of jesus in ordinary hospitality
[1289.40 --> 1298.60]  three years ago britney and i hosted a family from phoenix they knew britney's parents and they
[1298.60 --> 1302.08]  wanted to see this beautiful place called british columbia from the desert of phoenix to this
[1302.08 --> 1305.22]  you know garden of eden didn't rain when they visited which is wonderful
[1305.22 --> 1308.98]  but they stayed with us while they did their travels around here and we got to know them fairly
[1308.98 --> 1312.22]  well over the week it was the kind of thing where they came as strangers and they left as friends
[1312.22 --> 1317.22]  but as we got to know them they shared their stories neither of them grew up in the church one of them grew up in a very
[1317.22 --> 1323.02]  broken home and had such strange difficult stuff going on with his dad but what stood to both britney
[1323.02 --> 1328.92]  and me is how this couple and their family they had two kids had such a wide bandwidth for brokenness
[1328.92 --> 1333.00]  and they could invite anybody into their home at any time like doesn't matter what you're going through
[1333.00 --> 1335.78]  you're going through divorce you can stay with them your kids are going through trouble your kids can
[1335.78 --> 1339.94]  stay with them like didn't matter people in the city they seem to just find their way into their little
[1339.94 --> 1345.06]  home and they just adjust make space find a bedroom and people could be there and i thought man that home
[1345.06 --> 1351.28]  is just a place of ministry but one story in particular that really stood out to me is right before they visited us
[1351.28 --> 1355.50]  they said bye to a student middle eastern student who had stayed with them for a year while he was studying
[1355.50 --> 1359.56]  and it's through an organization cannot remember the name of the organization but they told me the story of how
[1359.56 --> 1364.54]  the organization was calling so many families trying to find a house for this guy to stay in
[1364.54 --> 1370.34]  he's just there for a year and family after family after family said no and finally this they got a hold of this couple
[1370.34 --> 1372.60]  they said yeah absolutely he can stay with us he can stay with us for free
[1372.60 --> 1378.30]  and the lady on the other end of the phone she said thank you so much it's been so hard for us to
[1378.30 --> 1384.66]  find a home in your city for someone from the middle east and that's when they were like oh
[1384.66 --> 1392.34]  this is what christians do this is how we operate this is like different from the way so many people
[1392.34 --> 1398.10]  think that you know they might see them as a threat we see them as guests and let me just ask the
[1398.10 --> 1405.02]  question who are those people who are the vulnerable in your life in your circles in your workplace in
[1405.02 --> 1413.78]  your classroom that you're feeling nudged by the spirit of god to wash the feet of to love to share
[1413.78 --> 1421.94]  life with to care for to open your home to i invite that question to go into your small groups i invite
[1421.94 --> 1428.24]  that question to go to your table as you break bread this afternoon this evening where do you feel
[1428.24 --> 1433.06]  god saying this is where i want you to serve this is where your burdens meet the real needs of the city
[1433.06 --> 1437.04]  and this is how you can wash the feet of your vulnerable neighbors
[1437.04 --> 1451.34]  jesus wants simon's eyes to be open so much of jesus's attention is focused on simon because he
[1451.34 --> 1456.62]  wants simon to learn from this woman who he is he wants simon to see himself and jesus knows that if
[1456.62 --> 1462.46]  simon sees him jesus for who he is it's going to transform his relationship with that woman it's
[1462.46 --> 1468.18]  going to transform the way he loves her cares for sees her sees her place in god's kingdom but simon's
[1468.18 --> 1476.50]  heart first needs to be melted by the grace of christ he needs to see the breadth of jesus love his
[1476.50 --> 1482.98]  concern for the whole of his world and the people who are deeply vulnerable and in great need and he's
[1482.98 --> 1492.78]  to know simon needs to know that jesus pulls them into his family and extends radical grace and love
[1492.78 --> 1499.74]  you know this story leaves me wondering at least for some reason i was wondering this week what was
[1499.74 --> 1504.50]  it like for simon after this meal you know i'm sure it's the kind of meal that never was forgotten in
[1504.50 --> 1509.56]  his household those pharisees did not forget that time they shared a meal with jesus and this woman came
[1509.56 --> 1513.44]  and jesus started telling a parable and then he forgave her and they got all frustrated because
[1513.44 --> 1517.72]  jesus is doing this like hosting now when he was the guest and he's doing things that only god does
[1517.72 --> 1523.86]  i wonder if simon kept tabs on jesus watching jesus do his ministry and trying to figure out what this
[1523.86 --> 1527.18]  kingdom is about why he's going to all these vulnerable people why he's inviting all the outsiders
[1527.18 --> 1532.62]  to be family with him what is this jesus on about and i wonder if word got back to simon
[1532.62 --> 1539.40]  what jesus said in his very final breaths before he was crucified with that mocking statement that
[1539.40 --> 1545.08]  he was the king of the jews i wonder if simon heard that what jesus said in his dying breaths was
[1545.08 --> 1553.70]  father forgive for they do not know what they are doing and if he heard that i wonder if it brought
[1553.70 --> 1560.86]  him back to the mini parable of this money lender who gives this money to these people and they can't
[1560.86 --> 1565.98]  pay it back and he just cancels all of it he forgives it all and i wonder if there's ever that moment
[1565.98 --> 1575.74]  where simon realized that's christ for his world bringing on himself all their sin all their mess
[1575.74 --> 1580.86]  all their brokenness all the ways they've been sinned against and taking all of that sin to the grave
[1580.86 --> 1585.44]  and rising victorious to start a whole new kingdom movement
[1585.44 --> 1591.44]  where all the grace of jesus is extended to all the people on the earth
[1591.44 --> 1601.76]  i hope simon saw it but you know as i preach this morning i want to know do we see it we are those
[1601.76 --> 1606.08]  who have had to some degree our eyes open we have responded in some way to jesus but do we see
[1606.08 --> 1612.18]  this side of jesus who takes the normal conventional structures of society says nope the upside down
[1612.18 --> 1617.24]  kingdom pulls in the weak it pulls in the vulnerable pulls in the poor it pulls in this woman
[1617.24 --> 1625.36]  who had no place around the table would she have a place around our table in our church
[1625.36 --> 1633.68]  in our family do we extend the hospitality of jesus because i tell you what if that becomes who we are
[1633.68 --> 1639.16]  we join the millions of christians throughout the world who realize that the way of christ pushes us
[1639.16 --> 1643.54]  to the margins it pushes us to the weak i mean you could read any church history book and what you'll
[1643.54 --> 1647.80]  find is it's the christians who start the hospitals it's the christians who go to the bombing zones
[1647.80 --> 1652.44]  where there's the war it's the christians who find the weakest most vulnerable most marginalized people
[1652.44 --> 1658.90]  say that's where the ministry is for us because we are followers of the jesus who welcomes the vulnerable
[1658.90 --> 1665.66]  and i'm convinced that when people see the church being the followers of jesus in this way
[1665.66 --> 1670.32]  it's good news for the city it's good news for the city
[1670.32 --> 1673.96]  let's pray together
[1673.96 --> 1680.22]  father we pray that you would help us see you
[1680.22 --> 1684.46]  and that we would see jesus for who he is
[1684.46 --> 1691.58]  we pray that we would understand what this story means for us as a church
[1691.58 --> 1696.68]  and that you would break our hearts for our city
[1696.68 --> 1700.16]  and for those in our city who are on the outside
[1700.16 --> 1701.80]  who are not seen
[1701.80 --> 1703.36]  who are not loved
[1703.36 --> 1704.54]  who are not cared for
[1704.54 --> 1706.52]  who are not brought in
[1706.52 --> 1710.62]  i pray that we would be the church that lives
[1710.62 --> 1712.46]  the hospitality of jesus
[1712.46 --> 1714.94]  in our words and in our deeds
[1714.94 --> 1718.32]  and i pray that you would fill us with your spirit
[1718.32 --> 1720.00]  to be courageously hospitable
[1720.00 --> 1724.60]  to be those who live the grace that we see in this passage
[1724.60 --> 1728.22]  and show the world the way of the upside down kingdom
[1728.22 --> 1731.02]  walk with us
[1731.02 --> 1733.62]  and enable us to be that church
[1733.62 --> 1736.30]  for the name of christ amen
[1736.30 --> 1749.84]  also
[1749.84 --> 1749.98]  you
[1749.98 --> 1750.06]  and
[1750.06 --> 1750.48]  still
[1750.48 --> 1750.52]  um
[1750.52 --> 1751.06]  uh
[1751.06 --> 1755.30]  you
[1755.30 --> 1755.42]  you
