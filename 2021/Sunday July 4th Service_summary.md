• Moses is tasked by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt
• God describes his plan to bring the Israelites to a "good and spacious land" flowing with milk and honey
• Moses' role as a hero of the Bible is reevaluated, showing him as a flawed but human character who was drawn into God's redemptive purposes

• Moses is called by God at 80 years old to lead the Israelites out of slavery and confront Pharaoh
• Moses' mother places him in a papyrus basket to save him from Pharaoh's decree
• Moses is adopted by Pharaoh's daughter and grows up in the Egyptian palace with tensions about his Israelite heritage
• Three snapshots of Moses' life before he was called by God are described:
	+ He kills an Egyptian beating an Israelite slave
	+ He meditates a conflict between two Israelites, but they fear him due to his past actions
	+ He drives away shepherds bothering women at a well and feeds their flocks
• These events demonstrate Moses' character: he cares deeply for his people, can't help interfering in conflicts, and is fiercely protective of others
• Moses' initial reaction to God's call is fear and reluctance
• Moses gives five excuses for not accepting the mission: "Who am I?", "What if the people don't believe me?", "I'm not eloquent", "Please send someone else", and "I'm just a shepherd"
• God responds to each excuse with reassurances, signs, and wonders that demonstrate his power and support of Moses
• Moses' excuses are based on his past experiences and fear of confrontation with Pharaoh
• God eventually becomes impatient with Moses' refusal and sends Aaron to join him on the mission
• The story of Exodus is not about Moses' heroism, but about God's power and character
• God equips and empowers Moses despite his fears and limitations
• The story highlights God's project of redemption and the role of humans in playing their part
• The narrative of Exodus 1-18 is a story of God confronting false worship, gods, and worldviews
