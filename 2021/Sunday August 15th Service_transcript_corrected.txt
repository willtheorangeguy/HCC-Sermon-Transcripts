[0.00 → 29.98] We'll see you in the next video.
[30.00 → 38.66] Good morning, everybody.
[60.00 → 67.84] I know you're always there.
[67.84 → 74.14] I'll always know you're there.
[90.00 → 119.98] I know you're there.
[120.00 → 149.98] I know you're there.
[150.00 → 155.72] I was told years ago that a church is only as healthy as its teenagers.
[156.00 → 162.50] And I have to say, over the last few weeks, it's been encouraging to see our teens leading the summer camp and our teens showing godly leadership.
[162.72 → 166.10] And I just give thanks for the way that young leaders are being formed in our church.
[166.10 → 174.94] And if that's not something you pray for, I just encourage you to pray for our children, our teenagers, and that we would have a future that is healthy and faithful to Christ in this season.
[174.94 → 178.54] We're going to continue our series.
[178.64 → 180.00] I'm just getting my Bible verse here.
[180.10 → 180.28] Sorry.
[180.62 → 182.86] We're going to continue our series on Exodus.
[183.54 → 188.60] Although Misha told me when we were planning this service that we should do something related to youth.
[188.66 → 192.86] I was originally going to preach on a chunk of laws in the book of Exodus.
[192.98 → 194.32] And I know that's exciting to you, too.
[194.92 → 196.98] But Misha said to me, we should do something focusing on youth.
[197.04 → 199.18] And I said, well, let's hit two birds with one stone.
[199.26 → 202.36] I'm going to preach on one instruction that God gives in Exodus.
[202.82 → 205.30] And it happens to be about families and our youth.
[206.08 → 208.52] And so if you have your Bible, turn with me to Exodus 20.
[208.82 → 209.86] I'm going to read verse 12.
[209.86 → 212.58] And then I'm going to read Ephesians 6.
[212.66 → 214.46] And both will be up on the screen.
[217.32 → 221.30] This is God's instruction given to the Israelites after he just freed them from slavery.
[221.86 → 225.02] And the first instruction on the relationships to one another is this.
[225.66 → 233.32] Honour your father and your mother that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.
[234.44 → 236.60] And now turn with me to Ephesians 6.
[236.60 → 243.02] Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[243.60 → 247.56] Honour your father and your mother, which is the first commandment, with a promise.
[248.10 → 252.74] So that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy a long life on the earth.
[253.50 → 254.08] And then this one.
[254.14 → 255.10] We don't want to hear the second part.
[255.28 → 257.76] Fathers, do not exasperate your children.
[258.44 → 259.30] Mothers, get a pass.
[259.80 → 264.50] Instead, bring them up in the training and the instruction of the Lord.
[266.60 → 272.48] Well, one of the interesting things about this last year and a half is that families, for the most part,
[272.80 → 277.14] God, maybe I should rephrase that, they had to spend a lot of time together.
[278.06 → 281.14] And I feel like of the last year and a half, I've seen different narratives.
[281.28 → 283.74] And I've heard many people say that it's been the best thing ever.
[284.28 → 286.06] That all the commitments were cancelled.
[286.38 → 288.10] That they got to spend lots of quality time.
[288.10 → 291.02] I mean, I know some families here, people were working from home.
[291.16 → 292.62] Their kids were now doing school at home.
[292.72 → 293.44] Everything was at home.
[293.50 → 294.62] And there was nothing going on.
[294.70 → 298.56] They just got to be together at home for weeks and weeks and weeks.
[299.22 → 300.42] But that narrative shifted.
[300.96 → 305.54] About six weeks in or so last year, I heard some youth say, okay, I love my parents.
[306.54 → 309.44] But there are some parents say, I love my kids.
[309.80 → 311.36] But I'm ready for them to go back to school.
[311.78 → 313.50] I'm not even worried about COVID anymore.
[316.04 → 319.86] But in this season, I do think over the last year and a half, as families have been together,
[319.98 → 324.56] it's been a really important season to take stock of how those relationships are going.
[324.92 → 327.34] To actually ask, how's it going with my daughter?
[328.04 → 329.82] How's my relationship with my son?
[329.92 → 332.14] And for students, how am I doing with my parents?
[332.48 → 335.82] Now that I'm with them a lot more hours of the day, how is this relationship going?
[335.86 → 337.38] And why is there tension here?
[338.06 → 340.06] Why are we struggling there?
[341.36 → 346.34] This morning, as we look at this instruction from God in Exodus 20 and Paul's instruction
[346.34 → 351.16] in Ephesians 6, we want to hone in on what God has to say about our homes.
[351.90 → 356.74] And I just want you to know at the outset that this, yes, is a command for youth and for
[356.74 → 359.52] children, but it's also got a lot to say for parents.
[359.60 → 362.32] And if I had to predict how this sermon was going to go this morning, it's going to start
[362.32 → 366.04] with parents elbowing their children, and then it's going to move to children elbowing
[366.04 → 368.92] their parents, and then we're all going to start elbowing each other, and it's going
[368.92 → 369.30] to be great.
[369.30 → 374.26] But this has a lot to say for children, and it has a lot to say for parents.
[374.34 → 378.72] And before I go into what it says about parents or to children, I want you to know how significantly
[378.72 → 380.20] placed this instruction is.
[380.22 → 384.68] If you look at the Ten Commandments, you can't help but notice how much God cares about our
[384.68 → 386.90] family life, what happens in our homes.
[387.40 → 392.36] The first four commandments are all about our relationship with God, and the second six commandments
[392.36 → 393.70] are all about our relationship with our neighbour.
[393.70 → 398.92] The very first commandment about our relationship with our neighbour is about our homes.
[399.62 → 402.70] It's about parents and their children, children and their parents.
[403.12 → 408.40] And this says to me, at least, that God has a huge concern for what happens in our homes.
[408.84 → 412.56] He's very concerned with what happens at the dinner table, in the living room, the conversation,
[412.84 → 417.16] the kind of formation and instruction that's taking place in our homes.
[417.16 → 423.00] He cares about that, and He wants there to be peace and shalom and life in that relationship
[423.00 → 424.86] between parents and children.
[425.34 → 426.34] Doesn't that sound good?
[426.34 → 430.16] I also want to name two things at the outset.
[430.28 → 432.44] I'm going to come back to both of them, I think, in this sermon.
[432.60 → 437.60] One is, I'm aware that as I preach this sermon on parents and children, that we have a complex
[437.60 → 440.48] reality in today's culture with family.
[440.58 → 443.64] We have a lot of different family scenarios that are very complicated, and I'm going to
[443.64 → 444.26] come back to those.
[444.32 → 449.12] But secondly, I want to say unashamedly at the beginning that when God gives instructions,
[449.90 → 453.36] when He gives laws to people, it is always for our flourishing.
[453.36 → 457.16] If you were here last week, you'll know we spent a lot of time talking about every single
[457.16 → 458.68] command that God gives.
[458.98 → 464.08] Behind those commands is His fatherly heart for His people to experience peace.
[464.66 → 470.20] His fatherly heart for homes to be places of peace, for families to flourish, for kids
[470.20 → 472.96] to grow up and flourish in their cities.
[473.38 → 478.28] And so behind this instruction is God's desire for us to flourish, okay?
[478.62 → 479.22] That's important.
[479.22 → 483.46] So let's get into this instruction in Exodus 20, verse 12.
[484.76 → 491.30] Honour your father and your mother, that you may live long in the land the Lord is giving
[491.30 → 491.62] you.
[492.54 → 495.68] And the first question I just want to ask is, what does it mean to honour?
[495.96 → 497.14] Maybe youth are asking that right now.
[497.18 → 499.74] What does it mean to honour my parents?
[500.26 → 503.28] And the scriptures, you should know, give a lot of rich nuance to that.
[503.76 → 507.92] In different passages and other translations, you can see the words revere.
[507.92 → 509.42] How does that sound?
[509.44 → 510.38] I like the sound of that one.
[511.00 → 513.38] Or respect your parents.
[513.60 → 514.72] Respect their instruction.
[514.96 → 516.50] Respect their position.
[517.06 → 521.54] And I agree that to honour your mom or to honour your dad is not just to respect them as a person,
[521.60 → 525.72] but to recognize whether you like it or not, they are your parent.
[527.00 → 530.74] They're the people that God placed you into care.
[530.74 → 534.78] I mean, we don't think about this very often, but that's the people.
[534.92 → 535.90] You don't get to choose them.
[536.62 → 537.52] They are your parents.
[537.82 → 543.14] And God gave them the overwhelming, beautiful responsibility of raising you to know him,
[543.70 → 547.52] to love him, to live wisely in this world as a follower of Jesus.
[547.66 → 550.52] That's the responsibility given to parents.
[550.52 → 557.16] And for children and youth, we have to respect that authority and that role.
[557.86 → 560.08] One of the writers I was reading this week, I really appreciate it.
[560.10 → 564.84] He said, you know, we respect our parents because, not just because of the wisest or the fairest,
[565.40 → 567.78] we respect them because they're the parents God gave us.
[568.66 → 570.14] I know sometimes you wish you could do trades,
[571.14 → 574.70] but your parents are the parents God gave you.
[574.70 → 578.36] And we honour that position in our lives.
[579.12 → 581.48] I can already see I'm making some of our teenagers nervous.
[581.74 → 582.98] That wasn't my intention in this sermon.
[583.74 → 588.04] Also, to honour our parents and respect them is to listen to them.
[588.96 → 593.38] The Proverbs are full of instructions for young men and applies to young women as well,
[593.46 → 596.34] saying, don't you neglect the teaching of your father.
[596.72 → 600.00] Take the instruction of your mother and bind them around your neck.
[600.08 → 601.18] Keep them in your heart.
[601.18 → 606.20] If you want to be wise and live well in this world, you take that teaching and you hold it.
[607.00 → 609.02] You obey their instruction.
[610.56 → 615.38] To honour your parents is not to balk at every single rule.
[616.20 → 620.86] It's not to second guess every time they put perimeters in place for us to live well.
[621.08 → 625.20] It's not to say, but, after every time they give instruction.
[625.94 → 628.34] It's to recognize that God placed you under their care.
[628.34 → 631.42] Their instruction is to form you in the way of Christ.
[631.52 → 632.82] And yes, we're going to nuance that later.
[633.26 → 635.58] They don't get carte blanche to tell you to do whatever they want to do.
[636.46 → 641.90] And your role as a child and as a youth is to listen, to take to heart,
[642.26 → 644.44] and to walk in the way that they are instructing.
[646.02 → 651.96] Now, here I want to just name a reality that we can't talk about in this kind of setting that we live in.
[651.96 → 658.66] And that is that the cultural narrative that you and I are living in and growing up in frames teenage life like this.
[659.04 → 660.34] Your parents don't know anything.
[661.30 → 662.72] They are so dumb.
[663.76 → 667.00] Therefore, you don't have to listen to anything because they don't understand you.
[667.10 → 668.42] They were never teenagers, right?
[668.56 → 668.90] Never.
[669.18 → 670.12] They were never teenagers.
[670.64 → 672.00] They don't have any wisdom to give you.
[672.10 → 674.68] Therefore, your job is to say, you don't know anything.
[674.90 → 678.64] I'm the smartest person in the world now that I turn 13, and I'm going to be that way until I turn 20.
[678.78 → 679.92] Then I realize I didn't know anything.
[680.40 → 685.54] And I'm just going to reject your authority, do my own thing, make your life miserable, and just do my own thing.
[686.22 → 687.44] That's the cultural narrative.
[687.58 → 693.96] And one of the things that Brittany and I, whenever we watch movies, we just roll our eyes at how often the parents are depicted as foolish
[693.96 → 696.48] and the teens are depicted as knowing better.
[696.56 → 697.96] And I think, I'm just not so sure.
[698.54 → 701.68] Maybe sometimes that's the case, but that's definitely not the norm.
[701.68 → 707.24] I think we can all acknowledge that in our teenage years, we shouldn't get the driving wheel for our whole lives,
[707.80 → 711.48] even though you can get the driving wheel for a car, which is terrifying all by itself.
[714.34 → 717.04] So we honour our parents by listening to them.
[717.62 → 722.08] And we recognize that the narrative script laid out for us in culture is not our story.
[722.56 → 723.32] That's not our story.
[723.88 → 726.84] And I'm encouraged, as I talk to some of the parents in our own church who have said to me,
[726.84 → 729.12] you know, the teenage years for us were good years.
[729.12 → 735.28] Not necessarily easy years, but good years of seeing our children kind of wrestling with what they've grown up with,
[735.62 → 739.24] sort of wrestling with what it means to listen to their instruction, starting to think for themselves,
[739.48 → 744.18] and then realize that this is the place as a family to grow and learn and become disciples.
[745.12 → 750.98] Teenage years do not have to be the script of, you know, Outer Banks for some of our youth leaders who were just talking about it.
[751.16 → 753.74] That doesn't have to be our narrative for being a teenager.
[753.74 → 756.62] I'm not commending Outer Banks, by the way.
[756.80 → 757.74] I've never even seen it.
[757.76 → 760.56] I just know that it's been talked about by our summer camp leaders.
[763.24 → 767.02] To honour our parents is to respect the position God gave them in our lives,
[767.68 → 772.04] is to receive their instruction, to bind it around our hearts, to take it seriously.
[772.74 → 774.86] But before I say how this passage speaks to parents,
[774.92 → 778.82] I want to talk about how honouring our parents is also called to care for them.
[778.82 → 782.88] Years ago when I was taking a class at Regent with a professor named Daryl Johnson,
[783.40 → 788.90] he wanted to show how this passage had so much to say for parents, or children actually, of aging parents.
[788.96 → 790.42] And I know there's many of us here this morning.
[791.02 → 792.22] Listen to what Daryl Johnson writes.
[792.26 → 793.16] It should be up on the screen.
[793.16 → 798.42] Look at how they sacrificed their lifestyle for us.
[799.38 → 805.82] For 10 to 20 years, isn't it fair that we return a decade or two of care for them?
[805.82 → 810.44] Think of how totally dependent we were on them for at least five years.
[811.00 → 813.04] We stifled their lifestyle with dirty diapers.
[813.30 → 814.08] Yeah, even you.
[814.56 → 815.04] Even you.
[815.78 → 818.26] And messy eating habits and our crying at night.
[818.80 → 821.38] Think of all the inconvenience we caused.
[822.46 → 827.18] Isn't it only fair to return the favour and be inconvenienced?
[827.72 → 829.96] They pushed us in our strollers for many years.
[830.06 → 834.20] Ought we not to push them in their wheelchairs for many years?
[834.20 → 839.46] Paul tells Timothy to remind children and grandchildren of widows to put their religion into practice
[839.46 → 843.70] by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents.
[843.96 → 846.48] For this is pleasing to God.
[848.50 → 854.52] I just want to say I know there's a number of people in our church right now who are caring for parents and for kids.
[854.72 → 856.06] It's called the sandwich generation.
[856.62 → 858.72] And I want you to know that God sees the care.
[858.72 → 866.42] He sees the unseen ways of caring for people, of bathing people, of feeding people who used to be young and healthy and competent.
[866.62 → 871.32] But now you're pushing the wheelchair, and you are honouring them.
[873.66 → 877.12] Let's take a look now to see how this passage talks to parents.
[877.30 → 880.16] And by the way, children and youth, this is where you start elbowing your parents.
[880.16 → 885.30] The fifth commandment, also known as honouring your father and your mother, it assumes a lot.
[885.38 → 888.56] It assumes, number one, that their parents love the Lord.
[889.16 → 894.86] That the parents are following the Lord and that the parents are raising their kids to know and follow the Lord with them.
[894.94 → 897.06] That's the assumption behind this command.
[897.82 → 898.68] That's a big assumption.
[899.98 → 902.74] And I think it's important to recognize that that's an overwhelming task.
[902.74 → 912.02] In fact, whenever we do baptisms on this stage, and we have children getting baptized, I always want the parents to feel a little bit of the overwhelming responsibility they have.
[912.06 → 919.96] I want them to shake just a little bit to recognize that the parents have a big role in forming, shaping, and discipling these little kids.
[920.44 → 923.86] God gave them these kids, and he gives all of us our kids so that we can do that.
[923.86 → 935.08] I'm really intrigued by how in Ephesians 6, when Paul takes this teaching from Exodus 20, and he applies it now to the community in Ephesus, he says it this way.
[935.44 → 938.38] He says, children, obey your parents and the Lord for this is right.
[938.44 → 939.06] And then what does he do?
[939.12 → 942.10] Right after talking about this commandment, he talks to dads.
[942.78 → 950.34] He says, dads, don't you exasperate your children, but raise them up in the training and the instruction of the Lord.
[950.34 → 952.06] And as I already said, moms get a pass.
[952.40 → 953.84] They're allowed to exasperate their children.
[954.40 → 956.10] But dads, do not exasperate them.
[956.16 → 963.72] And Paul realizes that when he gives us instruction for children to honour, respect, and obey their parents, those parents better be worthy of it.
[964.32 → 971.38] They better be raising their kids, not exasperating them and giving them harsh rules or unneeded rules or things that just make life difficult for the home.
[971.96 → 973.08] But train them up.
[973.80 → 975.04] Teach them the way of Christ.
[975.72 → 978.00] Live out the life of Jesus before them.
[978.40 → 983.34] That's the assumed responsibility of the parents in Exodus 20 and in Ephesians 6.
[984.76 → 990.66] You know, one writer, a commentary on Ephesians, he writes this about the task of parenting.
[990.78 → 993.52] And when I read this, I just thought, this is a word for the church today.
[994.02 → 994.48] He writes,
[994.48 → 1008.14] Did you hear that?
[1008.14 → 1015.54] It means being more concerned for that relationship than their intellectual growth, their health, their material prosperity, their social status.
[1015.74 → 1019.44] More concerned for them to know, love, and obey Jesus Christ than anything else.
[1020.40 → 1023.08] And just to nuance that, I don't want you to hear that the rest doesn't matter.
[1023.08 → 1029.16] The point is that all of those dimensions of life are organized around that relationship with Jesus Christ.
[1029.66 → 1036.02] That your academic life, your school life, your friend life, your work life, that is organized and given meaning by your relationship with Jesus.
[1036.02 → 1043.60] When I look around in our church and in our city, I see a lot of intentional parenting.
[1044.42 → 1046.26] In fact, I see a lot of sacrificial parenting.
[1047.02 → 1053.62] I see parents who, when their kids fall behind in school, they will do anything to teach their children what they need to know to do well.
[1054.04 → 1060.04] They will sit at the kitchen table with those math books or those chemistry books or that calculus book, which is the worst class in high school.
[1060.04 → 1061.68] And they will help their kids learn.
[1062.18 → 1067.40] And I've seen how parents, when their kids are showing some giftedness in sports, they will put them in the programs.
[1067.50 → 1068.66] They will put them in the summer camps.
[1068.86 → 1069.54] They will do that.
[1069.58 → 1074.30] They will sit on the sideline for hours cheering on their kids so they become good at that sport.
[1074.82 → 1078.04] Or music, getting to hear some of our youth play and their skilled music.
[1078.82 → 1084.44] I've seen parents give so much that their children learn instruments and become skilled at them.
[1084.44 → 1088.94] Sitting on the bench of the piano as they learn chopsticks and then much better music to listen to in the home.
[1088.94 → 1090.52] They sacrificially give.
[1090.78 → 1096.62] And I've wondered what if we showed that kind of intentionality with their devotional lives?
[1097.78 → 1100.84] What if we showed that kind of intentionality with prayer in our homes?
[1101.68 → 1105.20] What if we showed that kind of intentionality with the scriptures in our homes?
[1105.28 → 1107.32] And not just to divide those, but to recognize that.
[1107.32 → 1116.44] What if we showed care and concern for how our faith in Jesus shapes our athletic lives, our music lives, our academic lives, and our friendship lives?
[1116.44 → 1123.44] How we see all of those things, those good things, given meaning and purpose in and through Jesus Christ?
[1123.84 → 1125.62] What kind of parenting would that be?
[1127.36 → 1134.96] And just to pause and say, I recognize that no parent can do this on their own.
[1135.12 → 1140.52] I want to highlight, and sometimes when you preach on this kind of passage, you can overstate the role of a home and understate the role of a church.
[1140.52 → 1146.44] I want to highlight, no parent can raise children on their own to do this and be faithful in that.
[1146.50 → 1147.16] We need each other.
[1147.24 → 1147.78] We need the church.
[1147.88 → 1148.64] We need our small group.
[1148.72 → 1149.58] We need grandparents.
[1149.78 → 1152.96] We need extended family to pray and serve and help us in that parenting job.
[1153.00 → 1153.52] It's hard.
[1153.52 → 1160.56] But I want to state very clearly that what matters in our home, that God cares about what happens in our homes.
[1161.28 → 1173.20] And that we need to show as parents who care about Jesus a deep concern that these children of ours see the gospel, hear the gospel, observe the gospel in the home.
[1173.78 → 1175.92] That matters to our Lord.
[1176.06 → 1177.98] That matters that this stuff takes place.
[1179.38 → 1180.74] Three years ago, oh no, more than that.
[1180.82 → 1182.80] Like six years ago, a book came out called Sticky Faith.
[1182.80 → 1184.40] Has anyone heard of that book, Sticky Faith?
[1185.06 → 1186.24] I see a couple nods.
[1186.34 → 1189.44] I read that book basically start to finish in one day because I was so intrigued.
[1189.52 → 1194.10] It was basically put out by Fuller Seminary or Fuller in wherever it is in the States.
[1194.46 → 1200.50] And it did tons of studies on youth ministry, tons of studies on family life, and all the faith formation dimensions you'd be curious about.
[1200.80 → 1202.36] And some of the findings it found were stunning.
[1202.48 → 1204.50] And two things that I'll never forget from this.
[1204.50 → 1211.98] Number one, it said unequivocally, no youth pastor, no pastor, no church leader can ever out-influence a parent.
[1212.80 → 1214.06] For better or for worse.
[1214.46 → 1216.00] Even Misha, she's amazing.
[1217.20 → 1218.60] Can out-influence a parent.
[1218.68 → 1224.30] And the reality is, even if you've got terrible parents, they're going to shape you more than your pastor or your youth pastor.
[1224.34 → 1225.56] We wish it wasn't always that way.
[1225.72 → 1228.70] But that's how God designed it, that parents have that kind of influence.
[1228.90 → 1230.90] Because the home is such a formative place.
[1230.90 → 1238.24] The second thing that's really important to think about as parents is that faith is caught more than faith is taught.
[1239.42 → 1240.90] You know what I mean when I say that?
[1242.16 → 1245.40] And that is to say, our children and our youth are very wise, observant people.
[1245.76 → 1248.46] And they're not just interested in hearing you say, hey, go do this.
[1249.04 → 1249.92] Go obey this.
[1250.26 → 1253.28] The children and youth need to see parents who themselves are living out that.
[1253.28 → 1260.96] And when you live your faith and your obedience to Jesus before your kids, that's going to have a profound impact on them.
[1261.04 → 1262.42] Kids can see right through us.
[1262.44 → 1263.08] You know this, right?
[1263.60 → 1265.10] They can see right through our incongruence.
[1265.34 → 1267.46] And the worst thing we can say to them is, do it as I do.
[1268.02 → 1268.60] Don't do it.
[1268.66 → 1270.26] Sorry, do as I say, but not as I do.
[1270.80 → 1272.60] And the children will follow what you do.
[1273.02 → 1274.94] Faith is caught more than taught.
[1274.94 → 1280.34] And I want us to hear this morning that our homes are profoundly formative places.
[1283.10 → 1286.44] James K. Smith wrote a book on practices of the home.
[1286.86 → 1291.38] For the last five years, I would say this has been a real interest of mine, just how our homes shape children.
[1292.06 → 1293.94] And thinking of our homes as places of formation.
[1294.08 → 1297.78] And this quote by James K. Smith, he talks about how we should think about our homes.
[1297.78 → 1304.76] And he writes, how can a home be a place to recalibrate our hearts?
[1305.84 → 1309.90] It means that we should be concerned about the ethos of our households.
[1310.46 → 1315.60] The unspoken vibe carried out in our home that is attuned to some end, some goal.
[1316.30 → 1320.56] We need to tune our homes and thus our hearts to sing his, that is Jesus, grace.
[1321.30 → 1324.28] That tuning requires intentionality in regard to the hum.
[1324.52 → 1328.16] The constant background noise generated by our routines and rhythms.
[1328.80 → 1330.10] And this is the challenging part for me.
[1330.42 → 1332.36] You can have Bible inputs every day.
[1332.36 → 1339.74] And yet have a household whose frantic rhythms are humming along to the consumerist myth of productivity and consumption.
[1340.50 → 1344.06] You might have Bible verses on the wall of every room of the house.
[1344.16 → 1349.92] And yet the unspoken rituals reinforce self-centredness rather than sacrifice.
[1351.16 → 1355.18] Each household and family does well to take an audit of its daily routines.
[1356.10 → 1358.68] What story is carried in those rhythms?
[1358.68 → 1362.66] What vision of the good life is carried in those practices?
[1363.24 → 1368.68] What sort of people are made by immersion in those places?
[1368.68 → 1376.88] And just sidebar on this, I think COVID has given us an incredible opportunity to stop and take stock.
[1377.38 → 1382.72] I've heard countless parents in our church say, we had so much going on, and we didn't realize it until COVID came.
[1383.14 → 1388.04] We were running here, there, and everywhere with work schedules, kids' sports schedules, with music and school, all the rest.
[1388.28 → 1389.90] We were such a busy family.
[1390.36 → 1393.70] And COVID finally forced us to say, this isn't healthy.
[1394.34 → 1395.70] We're not sharing meals together.
[1395.70 → 1396.88] We're not having conversation together.
[1396.92 → 1398.68] We're not actually praying together with our kids.
[1398.72 → 1400.52] We don't have time to put them to bed sometimes.
[1401.52 → 1405.66] COVID has given us a great moment to say, what kind of home do we want?
[1406.38 → 1410.94] And in this season of reopening, what might we need to now say no to?
[1411.66 → 1415.64] For the sake of lingering with our kids and having conversation about the day.
[1416.52 → 1418.98] Slowing down the bedtime routine so they can share.
[1418.98 → 1423.14] And you can literally minister to them with whatever they're going through.
[1423.32 → 1425.42] And pray with them for whatever they're going through.
[1425.72 → 1427.24] COVID is giving us this opportunity.
[1427.66 → 1429.60] Don't miss it, parents.
[1430.22 → 1430.96] Are you hearing me?
[1431.98 → 1434.58] I apologize for the high challenge sermon this morning.
[1436.00 → 1441.72] The command to obey our parents means for parents that we are serious about discipleship in our homes.
[1441.72 → 1446.76] And we are serious that our homes become places of faith formation.
[1448.76 → 1455.72] So it's here that I want to pause and recognize with you that this kind of passage really stirs up a lot of stuff in us.
[1455.78 → 1457.80] Number one, I think it stirs up in parents' guilt.
[1458.18 → 1459.38] And kids, you should know this.
[1459.62 → 1461.56] I don't know too many parents who feel like they're crushing it.
[1462.78 → 1464.26] I don't know too many parents who are like, you know what?
[1464.28 → 1465.86] I'm just knocking it out of the park with parenting.
[1466.10 → 1466.84] I'm patient.
[1467.72 → 1468.48] I'm gracious.
[1469.16 → 1470.50] We limit screen times.
[1471.56 → 1472.34] You get the point.
[1473.08 → 1476.24] But more than that, I think this passage often creates tension in us.
[1477.08 → 1481.86] I think a lot of us, if we're honest, we recognize that our family life is way more complicated than we want it to be.
[1482.76 → 1485.04] I recognize that some of us are parenting by ourselves.
[1485.24 → 1488.50] And me talking about this, you're like, how am I supposed to do this by myself?
[1488.88 → 1490.48] I'm working to take care of my kids.
[1490.64 → 1491.62] I'm parenting them by myself.
[1491.66 → 1493.86] How am I supposed to do what you're talking about in this passage?
[1494.78 → 1496.58] Some of us kids have parents who are fighting.
[1496.96 → 1498.06] And there's conflict in the home.
[1498.06 → 1500.44] There's no space for this kind of prayer or reflection or anything.
[1500.62 → 1504.32] How am I supposed to grow up in this environment where there's division or divorce?
[1505.26 → 1508.30] Some of us have blended families, and there are all sorts of complexity around that.
[1508.34 → 1509.40] We wonder what's possible.
[1509.80 → 1516.22] Or parents have kids with a variety of learning challenges and disabilities, and parents might be wondering,
[1516.22 → 1522.40] what's even possible for me in the faith formation of these kids with the challenges they're facing right now?
[1523.46 → 1529.80] Or finally, youth, and I've had youth talk to me about this, their parents aren't interested in the Christian faith.
[1529.86 → 1533.34] They have no desire to raise kids in this sort of way of Christ.
[1533.34 → 1539.72] And the kids are saying, okay, what does it look like for me to want to follow Jesus when my parents are pushing in a totally different direction from my life?
[1540.66 → 1541.58] Those are hard questions.
[1541.66 → 1543.04] I'm not going to answer them all this morning.
[1543.20 → 1546.10] You can come to my office, and we'll talk, and I'll learn from you, and we can talk more.
[1546.10 → 1555.40] But I want to say specifically to that last situation, for children and youth who are growing up in homes where there's just a whole vision for life that is not the gospel of Jesus,
[1556.06 → 1557.80] I want us to remember the first command.
[1558.58 → 1562.62] The first command in the Ten Commandments is all about worshipping God.
[1563.16 → 1565.24] In fact, when Jesus summarized the Ten Commandments, he says,
[1565.52 → 1570.76] the Ten Commandments are love the Lord with your whole heart, your soul, your mind, your strength, and love your neighbour as yourself.
[1570.86 → 1572.92] The first command is to love the Lord.
[1572.92 → 1583.14] And there will be times, youth, teens, when honouring your parent, respecting your parent does not lead to obeying your parent.
[1584.96 → 1586.86] That's not a carte blanche to disobey everything.
[1587.44 → 1592.70] But there will be times when the wisdom or the advice given is just not in line with what it means to be a disciple.
[1593.40 → 1596.42] And you have to make the hard choice of honouring God above parent.
[1596.70 → 1597.34] That happens.
[1598.58 → 1600.64] I think 90% of the time we still want to obey them.
[1600.64 → 1603.36] And honouring them looks different in different situations.
[1603.46 → 1604.32] But there will be times.
[1605.42 → 1612.68] In fact, it seems to me that a perfect baseline for growing up in healthy ways in your faith as a teen and young adult
[1612.68 → 1615.78] is to no longer be asking, what would my mom say?
[1616.46 → 1618.42] Or what would dad say about me in this circumstance?
[1618.78 → 1619.74] What do I do about this?
[1619.78 → 1622.86] The better question is, what does Jesus say?
[1622.86 → 1626.94] And there's that shift recognizing your parents have authority.
[1627.02 → 1627.60] You want to honour them.
[1627.66 → 1628.28] You want to respect them.
[1628.32 → 1628.90] You want to obey them.
[1628.92 → 1632.28] But there's that movement as you grow up to say, it's no longer just what mom and dad say.
[1632.34 → 1633.46] It's what does Jesus say?
[1633.66 → 1636.02] Now that I'm off to university, I don't have to go to church.
[1636.08 → 1636.96] What does Jesus say?
[1637.14 → 1639.56] Now that I'm starting my own home and my own family.
[1639.72 → 1640.84] Now that I live in my own place.
[1641.04 → 1644.12] What is my responsibility as a disciple of Jesus?
[1645.10 → 1646.44] That doesn't mean you dishonour your parents.
[1646.50 → 1647.80] It doesn't mean you no longer care what they say.
[1647.80 → 1651.64] But you recognize that the highest authority is Christ.
[1652.66 → 1656.86] And your parents will be delighted to know that your first question is not what mom and dad will say,
[1656.98 → 1658.40] but what does Jesus say?
[1659.08 → 1659.92] Are you with me on that?
[1660.82 → 1663.18] I know that my deep desire is as my kids get older,
[1664.18 → 1666.04] that they stop thinking, what is dad going to say?
[1666.10 → 1667.32] Especially because they're a pastor's kid.
[1667.34 → 1668.34] I already feel sorry for them.
[1668.64 → 1669.60] But what does Christ say?
[1670.34 → 1671.40] What does the scripture say?
[1671.90 → 1677.30] How do I prayerfully discern how to live, speak, and act as a follower of God?
[1677.80 → 1678.92] That's the question.
[1681.24 → 1684.84] But here's why I want to spend my last few minutes or many minutes.
[1685.40 → 1691.50] I think one of the major ways we need to respond to this passage is by asking,
[1691.66 → 1698.18] how do we live in our homes and in our families in the posture of grace?
[1699.08 → 1702.04] How do we be people who extend forgiveness?
[1702.24 → 1705.36] And I recognize, we all recognize that our families are messy places.
[1705.36 → 1707.88] There is so much failure as parents.
[1707.98 → 1709.24] There's so much failure as kids.
[1709.78 → 1712.68] There's so much brokenness that we never anticipated.
[1712.78 → 1715.00] But the question is not just how do we deal with the brokenness,
[1715.06 → 1717.44] but how do we live in that brokenness with a posture of grace
[1717.44 → 1720.16] and extend the very forgiveness that Jesus extends us?
[1721.20 → 1724.84] I don't know about you, but some of my most memorable moments as a teenager
[1724.84 → 1727.48] were moments of asking for forgiveness.
[1728.00 → 1729.90] And my dad asking me for forgiveness.
[1729.90 → 1732.54] And then extending grace and reconciling.
[1733.18 → 1737.04] Those are some of the most powerful memories I have of my childhood.
[1737.62 → 1738.32] Is that true for you?
[1739.40 → 1740.48] You thinking about those right now?
[1741.80 → 1745.14] I think one of the most distinctive things about a Christian home
[1745.14 → 1747.24] is not how broken it is,
[1747.54 → 1750.38] but how much grace there is in the midst of that brokenness.
[1750.38 → 1754.38] And this gets us right to the heart of the Christian faith.
[1754.50 → 1757.20] This gets us right to the heart of what's at the centre of what we believe.
[1757.26 → 1759.50] At the centre of the Christian faith is Jesus,
[1760.24 → 1762.08] who sees the mess of our world,
[1762.34 → 1763.70] the greediness of parents,
[1763.84 → 1764.98] the rebellion of children,
[1765.16 → 1767.02] all the broken ways that we discipline poorly,
[1767.10 → 1767.80] we raise poorly,
[1767.88 → 1768.56] we teach poorly,
[1768.72 → 1770.52] we respond poorly to their parenting.
[1771.18 → 1772.56] And Jesus takes all that sin,
[1772.64 → 1773.30] all that rebellion,
[1773.44 → 1774.80] all that mess,
[1775.90 → 1776.94] He takes it to the cross
[1776.94 → 1778.32] and says,
[1778.56 → 1779.18] I forgive you.
[1781.46 → 1783.00] I've taken your sin on myself.
[1784.02 → 1785.26] I've broken its power.
[1786.02 → 1788.92] And I've reconciled you to myself.
[1789.88 → 1791.82] That's at the centre of the Christian faith.
[1792.54 → 1794.42] And Jesus sends every disciple out
[1794.42 → 1798.62] to show that kind of eager reconciliation and forgiveness.
[1799.22 → 1800.54] Do we live with that in our homes?
[1801.80 → 1804.08] Do we have that posture with our kids
[1804.08 → 1805.54] when they're going off the rails?
[1805.54 → 1808.82] Do we have that posture with our parents
[1808.82 → 1811.08] when we no longer like
[1811.08 → 1812.86] what they're saying to us
[1812.86 → 1813.80] about how to live?
[1814.48 → 1815.88] Do we live in that posture
[1815.88 → 1818.76] of reconciliation and grace?
[1820.34 → 1821.64] I just want to suggest to you
[1821.64 → 1823.46] as a sort of action item on this sermon,
[1824.32 → 1826.10] who's coming to mind right now for you?
[1827.90 → 1829.24] Who's the person who you're like,
[1829.32 → 1831.28] okay, I'm feeling it.
[1831.98 → 1833.90] I feel the Holy Spirit sort of convicting me
[1833.90 → 1835.20] about this particular relationship.
[1835.20 → 1836.36] That particular grudge.
[1836.46 → 1837.68] This particular silent treatment
[1837.68 → 1838.86] that I've been punishing someone with
[1838.86 → 1840.32] for weeks, maybe years.
[1840.68 → 1842.92] Maybe this is the time to fire the text
[1842.92 → 1844.12] and say, let's grab that coffee.
[1844.66 → 1846.42] Maybe this is the time to pick up the phone.
[1846.48 → 1847.74] Remember that time we picked up the phone?
[1848.14 → 1849.28] And we talked to the person
[1849.28 → 1851.68] that we have not been in good relationship with
[1851.68 → 1853.58] where there needs to be reconciliation and grace.
[1853.82 → 1855.60] And why don't we be the person
[1855.60 → 1856.74] who takes that first step?
[1857.36 → 1858.50] I know many of us have been wounded
[1858.50 → 1859.34] and hurt by parents.
[1859.42 → 1860.62] Many of us are the parents who have wounded.
[1860.62 → 1862.44] Why don't we take the first step and say,
[1863.10 → 1863.74] I'm sorry.
[1865.18 → 1866.04] Forgive me.
[1867.48 → 1868.44] I'm sorry.
[1869.36 → 1871.12] I want to make this relationship right.
[1871.86 → 1873.38] Let's take those baby steps
[1873.38 → 1874.68] to reconciliation.
[1875.12 → 1876.10] And don't be surprised
[1876.10 → 1877.28] when the grace of Jesus
[1877.28 → 1878.40] and the power of the Holy Spirit
[1878.40 → 1879.64] is propelling you forward
[1879.64 → 1881.86] into reconciliation and healing.
[1881.96 → 1884.36] That's what Jesus does in our homes.
[1884.36 → 1891.60] This command in Exodus 20
[1891.60 → 1894.78] is the only command that attaches a promise.
[1894.92 → 1895.50] Did you know that?
[1896.08 → 1897.74] That's what Paul talks about in Ephesians 6.
[1897.82 → 1899.30] He says, this command comes with a promise.
[1899.44 → 1901.22] It says, oh, honour your mother and your father
[1901.22 → 1902.90] that you may live long in the land
[1902.90 → 1904.18] the Lord your God has given you.
[1904.80 → 1907.14] And Paul, of course, he echoes that in Ephesians 6.
[1907.46 → 1908.96] And just for your own self-preservation,
[1909.60 → 1910.44] listen to your parents.
[1910.62 → 1911.36] You'll live longer.
[1911.36 → 1914.42] It's not that simple, by the way.
[1914.64 → 1915.78] Although that can be the case.
[1915.84 → 1916.76] Your parents will make rules
[1916.76 → 1918.08] that make sure you don't hurt yourself
[1918.08 → 1918.86] in severe ways.
[1919.16 → 1920.06] And if you disobey those,
[1920.12 → 1921.56] you might actually cut your life short
[1921.56 → 1922.94] in really unhealthy kind of ways.
[1923.36 → 1924.58] But Paul's after something deeper.
[1924.64 → 1927.20] And he says, that it may go well with you, right?
[1927.62 → 1929.54] Paul says, honour your mom, honour your dad,
[1929.74 → 1930.76] that it may go well with you.
[1930.78 → 1931.68] And why does he say that?
[1932.74 → 1935.26] Paul's after the flourishing life
[1935.26 → 1938.08] that Jesus gives us by his death and resurrection.
[1939.04 → 1940.84] Paul knows that when you live with good parents
[1940.84 → 1941.96] who are giving you good instruction,
[1942.08 → 1943.92] they're giving you wise counsel rooted in the Bible,
[1944.14 → 1946.62] it's going to lead to a child living wisely
[1946.62 → 1948.00] and well in this world.
[1948.36 → 1949.62] It's going to lead to good decisions
[1949.62 → 1951.94] that bless friends, neighbours, parents,
[1952.36 → 1953.32] workplace friends.
[1953.70 → 1955.34] All of it will experience that blessing
[1955.34 → 1957.16] as we take good, godly instruction
[1957.16 → 1958.36] and we live into it.
[1959.08 → 1960.40] And surely you've seen this.
[1961.16 → 1963.38] Growing up, I had a number of, actually, relatives
[1963.38 → 1965.64] as well as older young adults in my church.
[1965.72 → 1967.36] And I saw them living out their faith.
[1967.36 → 1969.30] I saw them caring about their faith.
[1969.38 → 1971.10] And I saw how it blessed not just their home,
[1971.52 → 1972.40] but their friends.
[1973.20 → 1974.68] I saw blessing their workplaces
[1974.68 → 1975.94] when they finally get their first job.
[1976.00 → 1977.66] I saw God's blessing moving through a home,
[1977.96 → 1978.82] through wise instruction,
[1978.98 → 1980.80] two children, out to the city.
[1982.12 → 1983.96] And don't, make sure you see
[1983.96 → 1985.32] how this blessing in the family,
[1985.78 → 1987.84] as good instruction is received by children,
[1988.10 → 1989.26] it doesn't stay in a home.
[1989.74 → 1992.14] It moves wherever those children go.
[1993.00 → 1993.74] Think about that.
[1993.74 → 1997.28] But I'm convinced that some of the most impact
[1997.28 → 1998.44] we can make in our lives
[1998.44 → 2000.00] is if we raise our kids well.
[2000.88 → 2002.72] And God uses that raising them
[2002.72 → 2004.32] to know Jesus and follow Jesus
[2004.32 → 2005.36] as they go out in their lives
[2005.36 → 2007.00] way after we get old and gray and die.
[2007.08 → 2008.06] That blessing carries
[2008.06 → 2010.16] because our children are following the Lord.
[2011.32 → 2012.44] That's how the blessing moves.
[2013.26 → 2014.56] And I want to finish with an illustration
[2014.56 → 2016.72] that comes from a man named Jim Patterson.
[2017.82 → 2019.42] Jim tells the story I read this years ago
[2019.42 → 2020.70] of getting to know a guy named Mario.
[2020.82 → 2021.86] They're in university together.
[2021.86 → 2023.02] They're actually studying engineering.
[2023.88 → 2025.06] And Jim grew up in a family
[2025.06 → 2025.86] that loved the Lord.
[2025.94 → 2027.20] And Mario was the most suspicious,
[2027.42 → 2028.06] hostile person.
[2028.22 → 2028.78] And you can imagine
[2028.78 → 2029.52] as they became friends,
[2029.56 → 2030.70] they had so much conversation
[2030.70 → 2032.60] about faith, about God,
[2032.84 → 2033.56] about engineering,
[2033.84 → 2035.24] about what to do with your life
[2035.24 → 2036.54] as a young adult in university.
[2037.34 → 2038.66] But over the course of many years,
[2038.68 → 2039.26] and they stayed friends
[2039.26 → 2040.14] well after university,
[2040.46 → 2041.42] Mario came to faith
[2041.42 → 2042.78] through a whole series of events.
[2043.58 → 2044.32] And Mario and Jim
[2044.32 → 2045.32] were sort of debriefing
[2045.32 → 2047.50] his journey of faith,
[2047.58 → 2048.72] what made him want to become a Christian.
[2049.28 → 2050.46] And Mario said to Jim
[2050.46 → 2051.22] in a conversation
[2051.22 → 2051.68] where they're sitting
[2051.68 → 2052.24] on the front porch,
[2052.28 → 2052.46] he said,
[2052.50 → 2053.56] do you know what actually made me
[2053.56 → 2054.92] want to take the first step
[2054.92 → 2055.82] towards being a Christian?
[2056.98 → 2057.32] Jim's like,
[2057.34 → 2058.10] I have no idea.
[2058.36 → 2059.06] I'm guessing it was one
[2059.06 → 2060.16] of those debates we had.
[2060.68 → 2061.14] And Mario said,
[2061.20 → 2061.42] nope,
[2062.54 → 2063.54] it's going to your home.
[2065.48 → 2066.60] It was watching you
[2066.60 → 2068.18] and your young wife at that time.
[2068.54 → 2069.52] They had a child at the time.
[2069.56 → 2070.66] Just seeing the way they operated,
[2070.80 → 2071.44] the way they interacted,
[2071.56 → 2072.52] the way they shared a meal together,
[2072.60 → 2073.66] the way they raised their child.
[2074.18 → 2074.64] And Mario,
[2074.72 → 2075.82] who had just gotten engaged,
[2075.92 → 2076.64] he looked at this home
[2076.64 → 2077.06] and he says,
[2077.36 → 2078.12] I don't know exactly
[2078.12 → 2079.06] what it is they believe,
[2079.54 → 2080.48] but I want that.
[2081.42 → 2082.38] There's shalom there.
[2082.90 → 2083.84] There's peace there.
[2084.22 → 2085.70] And Mario left at home saying,
[2086.08 → 2087.46] if I want hope for my marriage,
[2087.50 → 2088.36] I want to do what Jim
[2088.36 → 2089.32] and his wife are doing.
[2090.04 → 2090.90] And Jim later,
[2091.54 → 2092.28] reflecting
[2092.28 → 2092.96] on his relationship
[2092.96 → 2093.42] with Mario
[2093.42 → 2094.04] and their friendship
[2094.04 → 2095.10] and where it led Mario,
[2095.18 → 2096.00] he writes this.
[2097.88 → 2098.38] He says,
[2098.38 → 2120.60] Even if our assessment
[2120.60 → 2121.40] is accurate,
[2122.36 → 2123.40] it is my observation
[2123.40 → 2124.50] that any Christian
[2124.50 → 2126.44] who is sincerely seeking
[2126.44 → 2127.34] to walk with God
[2127.34 → 2129.66] in spite of all their flaws
[2129.66 → 2131.66] is reflecting something
[2131.66 → 2133.12] of the beauty
[2133.12 → 2134.64] of Jesus Christ.
[2135.86 → 2136.54] Let's pray.
[2141.00 → 2141.48] Father,
[2141.54 → 2142.52] we begin with gratitude
[2142.52 → 2143.92] for your instruction.
[2145.58 → 2146.58] And we pray, Lord,
[2146.62 → 2147.76] that we receive your word
[2147.76 → 2149.08] with open hearts this morning.
[2150.80 → 2151.26] Lord,
[2151.32 → 2151.82] I want to pray
[2151.82 → 2153.26] for every single parent
[2153.26 → 2154.94] and every single child
[2154.94 → 2155.84] in this church
[2155.84 → 2156.48] and our community.
[2157.50 → 2158.28] And we pray
[2158.28 → 2158.98] for your healing
[2158.98 → 2160.16] where there is brokenness.
[2161.00 → 2162.44] We pray for reconciliation
[2162.44 → 2163.54] where there is division
[2163.54 → 2164.26] and pain.
[2164.92 → 2165.58] And we pray
[2165.58 → 2166.72] that your Holy Spirit
[2166.72 → 2168.38] would reunite
[2168.38 → 2169.26] the division.
[2170.68 → 2170.90] Lord,
[2170.94 → 2171.86] we pray for your grace
[2171.86 → 2173.34] to flow through our homes.
[2173.92 → 2174.92] And we ask that
[2174.92 → 2175.46] you're blessing
[2175.46 → 2176.34] would not just flow
[2176.34 → 2176.96] in our homes
[2176.96 → 2177.54] and your grace
[2177.54 → 2178.20] would not just work
[2178.20 → 2178.66] in our homes,
[2178.76 → 2179.28] but it would work
[2179.28 → 2180.58] through our homes
[2180.58 → 2181.84] to bring blessing
[2181.84 → 2182.66] and peace
[2182.66 → 2183.44] in our city.
[2183.44 → 2186.20] To you be all the glory.
[2186.70 → 2187.00] Amen.
[2189.98 → 2191.16] I invite you to stand
[2191.16 → 2191.90] and join me
[2191.90 → 2193.00] in singing our song
[2193.00 → 2193.70] of response,
[2193.78 → 2194.96] The Lion and the Lamb.
[2194.96 → 2195.00] The Lion and the Lamb.
[2195.00 → 2204.84] of the Lion and the Lamb.
[2207.52 → 2210.52] The Lion and the Lamb.
[2210.52 → 2210.60] The Lion and the Lamb.
[2210.60 → 2211.44] The Lion and the Lamb.
[2211.44 → 2212.02] The Lion and the Lamb.
[2212.12 → 2212.54] The Lion and the Lamb.
[2212.58 → 2214.42] The Lion and the Lamb.
[2214.42 → 2215.06] The Lion and the Lamb.
[2215.06 → 2216.10] The Lion and the Lamb.
