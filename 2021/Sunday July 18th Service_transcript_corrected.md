[0.00 → 29.98] Thank you.
[30.00 → 59.98] Thank you.
[60.00 → 89.98] Thank you.
[90.00 → 108.28] Thank you, Was.
[108.98 → 111.08] Very grateful for our musicians at Hope.
[111.08 → 116.44] You know, a couple of weeks ago I said, I made the joke, I'm like, our church misses worshipping
[116.44 → 116.82] together.
[116.98 → 120.12] And someone said to me, we should have a shorter sermon and a longer worship set.
[120.20 → 122.28] And Stu was like, challenge accepted, Dave.
[122.60 → 125.52] And now I have a sore throat going into the sermon because we were singing.
[125.52 → 129.24] Well, welcome to Hope.
[129.42 → 130.56] I see a number of new faces.
[130.68 → 131.74] I want to say welcome back.
[131.88 → 134.96] And also, if this is your first time here, we're so glad that you can worship with us.
[136.06 → 138.68] If this is your first time here, you should know that we're in the middle of a series of
[138.68 → 139.28] the book of Exodus.
[139.68 → 145.70] We've looked at how God hears the cries of a people in slavery, how he calls Moses, this
[145.70 → 150.28] mediator, to speak to an oppressive leader that is Pharaoh in the city of Egypt.
[150.96 → 152.12] And God sends plagues.
[152.38 → 156.00] Jonathan, last week, he preached through all the plagues that God sends, not just to show
[156.00 → 159.26] his power, but to show his power over the Egyptian gods.
[159.72 → 163.50] And this week, we're going to pick up right where we left off with Israel leaving Egypt
[163.50 → 164.80] and going to the Red Sea.
[165.32 → 168.10] So if you have your Bible, turn with me to Exodus 14.
[168.26 → 170.48] I'm going to read a portion of Exodus 14 and 15.
[170.90 → 174.46] And if you don't have your Bible, you'll see the words on the screen there.
[174.46 → 174.58] Amen.
[174.58 → 174.66] Amen.
[180.28 → 189.70] Then the Lord said to Moses, stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow
[189.70 → 193.04] back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.
[193.88 → 198.10] Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak, the sea went back to its place.
[198.86 → 202.74] The Egyptians were fleeing toward it, and the Lord swept them into the sea.
[203.34 → 206.22] The water flowed back and covered the chariots and the horsemen.
[206.22 → 211.88] The entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea, not one of them
[211.88 → 212.60] survived.
[213.66 → 217.92] But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with the wall of water on their
[217.92 → 219.22] right and on their left.
[220.04 → 224.80] That day, the Lord saved the Israelites from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the
[224.80 → 226.62] Egyptians lying dead on the shore.
[227.52 → 232.32] And when the Israelites saw the great power of the Lord displayed against the Egyptians,
[232.32 → 237.26] the people feared the Lord and put their trust in Him and in Moses, His servant.
[238.48 → 242.02] Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord.
[242.56 → 245.30] I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted.
[245.78 → 248.80] Both horse and rider He has hurled into the sea.
[249.42 → 251.62] The Lord is my strength and my defence.
[252.14 → 253.52] He's become my salvation.
[254.48 → 256.82] He is my God, and I'll praise Him.
[257.34 → 259.58] My Father is God, and I will exalt Him.
[259.58 → 261.58] The Lord is a warrior.
[262.52 → 263.72] The Lord is His name.
[264.52 → 267.08] Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea.
[267.18 → 270.34] The best of Pharaoh's officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
[270.70 → 272.38] The deep waters have covered them.
[272.76 → 274.60] They sank to the depths like a stone.
[275.64 → 278.18] Your right hand, Lord, was majestic in power.
[278.88 → 281.64] Your right hand, Lord, shattered the enemy.
[281.82 → 283.14] Jumping down to verse 11.
[284.00 → 286.52] Who among the gods is like you, Lord?
[286.52 → 291.36] Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?
[292.46 → 295.28] You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed your enemies.
[296.40 → 299.56] In your unfailing love, you will lead the people you have redeemed.
[300.48 → 303.18] In your strength, you will guide them to your holy dwelling.
[303.88 → 306.56] The nations will hear and tremble.
[306.56 → 322.54] Well, Hope, just a few years ago, after a worship service just like this one, our family went home, and we had a discussion about worship music.
[322.54 → 332.50] And we had a lively discussion about how it's changed over the years, and some of us grew up with hymns, and we're talking about contemporary songs, not divisive whatsoever in the history of the church.
[333.72 → 337.92] And we had this discussion about, you know, how it's changed, the pros and cons of different styles.
[338.50 → 341.78] And we happened to be having a discussion in the presence of a friend named Jim Mullins.
[341.78 → 345.84] And Jim was listening to this conversation, which went on probably up to an hour.
[346.28 → 349.04] And near the end of our conversation, he finally piped up.
[349.44 → 358.66] And Jim said to us, you know, I didn't grow up a Christian, and so I can't really comment on the different styles of worship music and what's best and what's the most contextual.
[358.80 → 361.90] He's like, but let me tell you my first experience of going to church.
[362.64 → 364.36] He's like, I went to church when I was a young adult.
[364.40 → 365.08] I was in university.
[365.26 → 366.06] Someone invited me.
[366.36 → 367.68] First time ever being there.
[367.68 → 369.50] I sat right in the back.
[370.00 → 371.70] And he's like, then the weirdest thing happened.
[372.94 → 377.38] As I sat down, everyone else, unannounced, stood up.
[378.02 → 380.12] And they all started singing together.
[380.84 → 383.32] It was like a giant karaoke gathering.
[383.74 → 386.08] And he said, nobody prepared me for that.
[386.58 → 389.44] Nobody prepared me for this thing you do called singing.
[390.46 → 396.40] And what was running through Jim's mind is just the basic question, why do Christians sing at all?
[396.40 → 398.14] I mean, perhaps it's your first time here.
[398.24 → 404.48] Maybe you're new to the Christian world, and you're like, why is it that these people at Hope Community Church stand and they sing?
[404.90 → 408.38] You don't do that most places around here other than karaoke.
[409.76 → 415.80] And I'm curious, if you were sitting beside someone, comes to church for the first time, never did this corporate worship singing thing,
[416.32 → 419.38] what would you say to them after the service about why we sing?
[419.38 → 421.44] What would you say to them?
[421.54 → 427.04] Hey, this is why we come to gather for worship as a community, and this is why we actually stand up, and we sing praise.
[427.04 → 436.44] In Exodus 15, which we just read, we've just come to the end of what I think is a fairly fast-paced narrative
[436.44 → 441.24] that describes God hearing the cries of His people, God calling Moses, God sending plagues,
[441.38 → 446.20] God drawing His people out of Egypt, God opening up the Red Sea to bring Israel through to safety,
[446.42 → 449.04] swallowing up the Egyptian army in that same Red Sea.
[449.04 → 455.10] And then we get to the Exodus 15, where all of a sudden the narrative stops and a song starts.
[455.80 → 460.84] It's kind of like a musical where the main characters, they actually stop doing their acting and they just start singing.
[461.66 → 463.72] And in some sense, it's a little bit weird.
[464.44 → 470.42] But if you know the story, you'll know that this is the only thing that Israel could do in these circumstances.
[471.58 → 474.80] Try to imagine yourself in their position for just a moment.
[474.80 → 478.26] Four centuries of slavery.
[478.84 → 480.40] Four centuries of slavery.
[480.52 → 482.64] They got progressively worse at the end.
[483.54 → 492.16] Being oppressed by Egyptians, living in the Egyptian world, being a slave nation that's only tasked to build up the empire of your oppressors.
[492.76 → 495.02] Then this Yahweh God comes out of nowhere.
[495.16 → 500.26] He meets with Moses, who some of the people probably had issues with because he's Israelite but not really kind of Egyptian.
[500.76 → 502.54] And then God says He's going to rescue them.
[502.54 → 506.94] And then, much to their own surprise, He starts sending plagues in power.
[507.08 → 507.98] He shows His power.
[508.26 → 509.62] He judges the gods of Egypt.
[509.94 → 515.62] Then, to their own surprise, He actually gets Pharaoh to let the whole slave nation go, which they didn't think was possible.
[516.30 → 520.74] Then they go to the Red Sea, and they're like, okay, now we're going to die because the Egyptian army is chasing after us.
[520.94 → 522.70] And God, again, does the unimaginable.
[523.24 → 524.52] He opens up the Red Sea.
[524.96 → 526.08] They walk through it.
[526.26 → 527.82] And then He drowns the Egyptian army.
[528.50 → 531.24] And there's only one thing that they could do in that circumstance.
[531.24 → 534.02] Only one appropriate response.
[535.16 → 536.08] That was singing.
[537.20 → 538.08] It was worship.
[538.90 → 539.70] It was music.
[540.04 → 542.44] And with Miriam and the women, it was dancing.
[542.86 → 543.34] That's right.
[543.82 → 544.28] Dancing.
[545.86 → 547.44] That's the only appropriate response.
[547.52 → 549.22] And I think you understand this to some degree.
[549.30 → 555.52] Even in your own lives, there's something about music and singing that is just the most appropriate response to something.
[555.52 → 557.10] That's why at weddings we sing.
[557.84 → 559.66] That's why at funerals we often sing.
[560.10 → 563.92] It's why at major celebrations and milestones someone's going to start playing music.
[564.04 → 567.70] Or even when you're in crisis, going through grief, what do you do?
[568.22 → 573.94] You flip through your playlist on your phone, and you're looking for a song that captures that experience.
[573.94 → 581.18] There's something so deeply embedded into our human beings that only music and singing can express.
[582.08 → 586.36] And on the shore of the Red Sea, Israelites watched God do His thing.
[586.94 → 588.22] All they could do was worship.
[589.60 → 594.22] And they worshipped, you have to know this, because they realized who God was.
[594.22 → 596.50] Remember, these were slaves.
[596.84 → 599.28] They barely knew this Yahweh God who met with Moses.
[599.44 → 606.34] And as they watched God send the plagues, as they watched God operate in power, as they watched Him open up the Red Sea, they discovered something about God.
[607.06 → 607.82] You know what it was?
[608.56 → 609.78] That He is a goal.
[611.00 → 612.26] You know what a goal is?
[613.92 → 614.56] Just kidding.
[614.68 → 616.02] That's a Hebrew word for redeemer.
[616.18 → 617.22] A goal is a redeemer.
[617.22 → 621.54] And they learned as they watched God do God's thing that this is a redeeming God.
[622.38 → 623.40] A rescuing God.
[623.40 → 629.36] In fact, in Exodus 6, when God meets with Moses, before the event even happens, He says to Moses,
[629.72 → 631.78] I've heard the cries of these people in slavery.
[632.60 → 637.58] I've heard them crying out and groaning under the violent, oppressive whips of Egyptian overlords.
[637.86 → 643.78] And I'm going to stretch out my hand and my mighty arm, and I'm going to goal them.
[644.24 → 645.74] I'm going to redeem them.
[646.36 → 647.50] That's what God says to Moses.
[648.14 → 649.76] Moses probably doesn't know what that looks like.
[649.90 → 651.76] The Israelites certainly don't think it's possible.
[651.76 → 657.88] And now on the other side of the Red Sea, I want you to hear what Moses sings in Exodus 15, 13.
[658.66 → 663.90] He sings, in your unfailing love, you will lead the people you have what?
[664.96 → 665.32] Redeemed.
[666.70 → 672.88] Moses and Israel realized that their God was not, this Yahweh God was not just sort of at a distance,
[673.14 → 675.54] who gives people a vague sense of spiritual peace.
[675.54 → 677.86] I mean, that's how we talk about religion in the West.
[677.96 → 681.48] It's like, your God is sort of there to give you a vague sense of spiritual peace.
[682.14 → 689.26] This God literally rolls up His sleeves, He puts His hands in the dirt, and He starts showing the Egyptian gods His power.
[689.80 → 691.62] He starts showing the Israelites His might.
[691.84 → 697.32] He starts promising, or making good on His promise, to rescue and redeem.
[697.32 → 705.50] And He literally stands up against Pharaoh, draws a slave nation, brings them to the Red Sea, and then defeats that army in the same Red Sea.
[705.50 → 712.82] And all the Israelites could do is say, wow, that's a rescuing God.
[713.80 → 715.06] That's a Redeemer God.
[716.12 → 721.98] Now, I realize for us today, when we talk about the word redeem, or being a Redeemer, it doesn't have a lot of cultural strength.
[722.10 → 723.88] Or like, the word is not a strong word.
[724.02 → 729.46] I think, when I say the word redeem, you probably think to yourself, oh, I'm going to save on across the road with my coupon.
[729.64 → 730.94] I'm going to redeem that coupon.
[731.32 → 731.60] Yay.
[731.60 → 736.20] But redeem in the ancient Near East was a big deal.
[736.26 → 740.90] And I want to just open up a bit of the context to the word being a Redeemer and what God does in redeeming.
[741.50 → 746.96] In the ancient Near East, in a big family, remember, all the families there lived as large, extended clans.
[747.02 → 748.00] Like, they were all together.
[748.64 → 753.38] And there was someone in that family who had the designation of being the Goal, the Redeemer.
[754.00 → 756.64] And they had a huge responsibility in their family.
[756.64 → 760.24] If someone were to get in trouble, their responsibility was to help them.
[760.24 → 763.56] If someone falls into debt, it was their responsibility to pay it back.
[763.86 → 770.28] In fact, a common problem in the ancient Near East is if you got a loan out, and you couldn't pay back that loan because your crops were poor,
[770.38 → 773.08] you'd have to sell yourself into slavery to pay that debt.
[773.60 → 780.10] The Redeemer was the one responsible to pay that debt for you and bring you back from slavery into the family.
[780.60 → 781.46] That's their job.
[781.46 → 786.54] Now, a writer by the name of Chris Wright, he's done a lot of writing on the book of Exodus.
[786.70 → 787.96] He's a scholar, Old Testament scholar.
[788.30 → 791.60] This is what he writes as he describes the role of a Redeemer.
[791.72 → 792.20] He says,
[792.20 → 820.66] And when the Israelites stood on the shore of the Red Sea, watching all that God had done, they realized he wasn't just holy,
[820.66 → 824.76] He wasn't just powerful, He wasn't just the creator, He was a Goal.
[825.54 → 829.52] He was a Redeemer who would stop at nothing to rescue His people.
[830.00 → 836.18] He would go to great lengths and great self-sacrifice to bring this little slave nation into freedom.
[836.88 → 846.00] He would go to great lengths to free them from religious, economic, social, political bondage so that they could live under His good rule as His people.
[846.00 → 848.62] God is a Redeemer God.
[848.62 → 852.76] And of course, no one saw that coming.
[852.88 → 857.04] I need to highlight again and again that Israel, when this all happened, they were learning.
[857.70 → 859.06] They didn't know that this was going to happen.
[859.16 → 861.28] And in fact, I think when Moses came to the Israelites, he said,
[861.38 → 862.14] This is what's going to happen.
[862.26 → 863.50] God's going to show His power.
[863.56 → 864.72] He's going to bring you out of slavery.
[864.82 → 866.24] They're like, not so sure.
[866.74 → 870.68] In fact, even as the Israelites are running to the Red Sea, some of them already begin grumbling,
[870.82 → 872.16] which we're going to see again in a couple of weeks.
[872.38 → 873.68] They're like, should have stayed in Egypt.
[873.88 → 874.94] Now we're going to die.
[875.14 → 876.38] This is a terrible idea.
[876.38 → 879.26] And then they see God do what only God can do.
[879.82 → 883.22] And the only appropriate response is worship.
[884.00 → 888.18] Singing, dancing, and praising this Redeemer God.
[890.30 → 896.74] Now before I go forward, I want to pause and highlight a reality of this passage that I think a number of us probably felt as we read it.
[896.96 → 898.30] And that's the reality of judgment.
[899.08 → 900.92] Perhaps you read through this passage, and you think,
[901.54 → 905.02] Ooh, Moses, I don't know if I can sing that like you do.
[905.02 → 911.92] In fact, going back to this whole hymns contemporary thing, there are a lot of hymns that were written about the horse and rider being thrown into the sea,
[912.06 → 913.78] celebrating God's judgment, showing His power.
[914.00 → 917.02] But a lot of churches don't sing any of these songs anymore because they think,
[917.18 → 921.54] I don't know if we can sing about God throwing an army into the sea.
[922.18 → 925.32] I don't know if we can sing about a God shattering the enemy.
[926.06 → 929.38] I don't know if this kind of God sits well with me.
[929.82 → 930.94] Maybe you feel that this morning.
[930.94 → 935.94] And there's a sense in which this passage, along with many other passages in the Old and New Testament,
[936.52 → 939.80] make us Western people feel uncomfortable with God as a judge.
[940.32 → 942.84] And so I want to give this time because I think it matters.
[944.08 → 946.94] There's no shortage of scholars, and you need to know this,
[947.04 → 950.12] new atheists like Richard Dawkins who look through the Bible, and they say,
[950.28 → 950.50] Ha!
[950.80 → 951.92] This is the passage.
[951.92 → 958.02] Your God is a retributive, violent, capricious God who's so unsteady.
[958.10 → 959.22] He's going to destroy people.
[959.30 → 960.04] He's not loving.
[960.24 → 961.62] How can you worship this God?
[962.22 → 963.86] Do you see what He's doing with the Egyptian army?
[963.96 → 965.48] They're floating dead in the sea.
[965.84 → 968.00] Can you really worship a God who does this?
[968.70 → 970.42] Your God is unloving.
[970.76 → 971.44] He's unkind.
[971.52 → 972.24] He's unfair.
[972.52 → 973.30] He's capricious.
[974.46 → 975.64] What would you say to that?
[976.14 → 976.82] I'm just curious.
[977.40 → 980.70] What's your response to many criticisms of a passage like this one that says,
[981.14 → 983.62] Hey, this judgment thing doesn't sit well with me.
[986.12 → 992.08] On a commentary on Exodus, Mark Glanville, a.k.a. the jazz pianist from a couple of weeks ago,
[992.94 → 994.92] he writes this, and I quite like this quote.
[996.42 → 999.28] Judgment, he writes, should disturb us.
[1000.78 → 1003.84] Judgment should disturb us because judgment disturbs God.
[1004.04 → 1004.80] Have you ever thought about that?
[1004.80 → 1005.28] Judgment.
[1005.70 → 1012.60] In Isaiah 28, 21, the prophet refers to judgment as God's strange work, God's alien task.
[1013.22 → 1015.70] Judgment is not God's preferred end for any of humankind.
[1016.08 → 1020.98] God did not create His image bearers for judgment, but for a thriving life within creation.
[1021.94 → 1026.06] We must affirm, and we do affirm as a church, the great love of God for all humanity.
[1026.20 → 1027.18] Think of John 3, 16.
[1027.26 → 1031.14] For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son.
[1031.14 → 1037.16] God is patient, but endless patience means endless suffering.
[1037.34 → 1037.92] Did you hear that?
[1038.30 → 1043.00] Or to use a Western vernacular, endless tolerance means endless suffering.
[1044.00 → 1048.02] Enslaved Israel yearned for God to come in power and call Pharaoh to account.
[1048.70 → 1052.20] And when God does come in power, Moses celebrates.
[1052.20 → 1063.10] Judgment in the book of Exodus is good news for slaves and bad news for people who oppress and kill others in order to gain wealth.
[1063.94 → 1064.68] What do you think of that?
[1064.68 → 1070.64] Miroslaw Golf, who lived himself and witnessed a genocide, he writes quite aptly,
[1070.72 → 1072.76] God isn't wrathful in spite of being love.
[1073.40 → 1076.66] God is wrathful because God is love.
[1077.62 → 1079.52] And Mark Danville in his commentary goes on to say,
[1079.52 → 1088.36] If we are to be believers in this God and live in hope of a world that is not enslaved to brokenness, violence, and corruption,
[1088.78 → 1090.56] we need a God who can judge.
[1091.32 → 1092.14] You catch that logic?
[1092.14 → 1097.58] And what he means to say is, our world, even as we speak, is full of all sorts of oppressive forces.
[1097.90 → 1100.44] There are armies that do not have good intent.
[1101.04 → 1103.28] There are corporations that do not have your good intent.
[1103.38 → 1103.94] You know this.
[1104.18 → 1108.48] There are individuals with a great deal of power who are not for the world and for humans.
[1108.98 → 1112.52] And if our world is to have hope, and we are to live with hope,
[1112.74 → 1118.22] we must place our trust in something or someone who can stand up to that oppression.
[1118.52 → 1119.32] Would you agree with me?
[1119.32 → 1122.92] We need to have a God who can do something about oppression.
[1123.40 → 1127.72] And a God who is endlessly tolerating oppression isn't much of a God to me.
[1127.78 → 1128.50] I don't know about you.
[1129.32 → 1133.76] But an endlessly tolerant God means we live in a world that is endlessly suffering,
[1134.22 → 1136.08] where Pharaoh has the last say.
[1137.12 → 1138.90] And so Mark Danville rightly says,
[1139.04 → 1142.78] God's judgment is indeed good news for the oppressed.
[1143.18 → 1144.90] It is good news for the slaves.
[1144.90 → 1146.90] It is good news for the poor.
[1147.96 → 1155.64] And Moses appropriately responds to what he's witnessing on the shore of the Red Sea with worship,
[1156.24 → 1163.68] with a sense of awe, a sense of trusting reverence that this Yahweh is a Redeemer God.
[1163.68 → 1168.70] Now, as we've already said in this series,
[1169.54 → 1173.82] the Exodus event, it foreshadows and it prefigures a greater rescue.
[1174.28 → 1180.32] The Exodus is the gospel of the Old Testament that foreshadows the great rescue gospel of the New Testament, right?
[1180.96 → 1186.02] It's no surprise that when Jesus is about to go to the cross, what is he doing right before that?
[1186.86 → 1188.08] Celebrating Passover.
[1188.08 → 1188.16] Passover.
[1188.74 → 1192.72] The great Old Testament celebration that looks back on God's rescue in the Old Testament.
[1193.02 → 1195.52] Right after that, Jesus is betrayed and goes to the cross.
[1195.76 → 1199.02] And it's no surprise that New Testament writers who believe in Jesus,
[1199.28 → 1205.96] they look at all that he did, and they start seeing this as the act where God rescues slaves.
[1206.58 → 1208.20] We see that language all over the New Testament.
[1208.36 → 1212.84] This is the act, the cross and the resurrection, where God rescues slaves.
[1212.84 → 1216.42] In Galatians 4, which I'll read later in the service,
[1217.72 → 1221.68] the Apostle Paul makes a major, major claim about the state of the world.
[1221.80 → 1224.84] It's an ontological claim about the condition of the world.
[1224.96 → 1228.10] He says, this world is enslaved.
[1229.88 → 1232.82] And he says, human beings are enslaved.
[1234.38 → 1238.18] And we don't talk that way, but he goes on in Galatians 4 to say that we're enslaved in two ways.
[1238.22 → 1241.60] We're enslaved to the spiritual forces of evil, which he says all over in the New Testament.
[1241.60 → 1244.52] And he says, we are enslaved to the power of sin.
[1245.90 → 1248.96] Our world is in a condition of slavery.
[1250.40 → 1256.32] Now, you can disagree with Paul, but I want to suggest to you that we see this slavery.
[1257.54 → 1262.96] I want to suggest to you that even though we don't talk as Western people about this enslaved nature that we find ourselves in,
[1263.02 → 1266.36] this enslaved world that we live in, that you see it in your workplace,
[1267.06 → 1270.90] you see it in your neighbourhood, you see it in your own home,
[1270.90 → 1272.60] see it in your schools.
[1273.16 → 1277.94] And if I had to guess, I would say a lot of us are Christians because we have experienced it.
[1279.50 → 1282.96] We are Christians because we've tasted the pain of slavery, right?
[1284.76 → 1286.62] And of course, in the West, we don't use that category.
[1286.76 → 1288.24] We don't think of ourselves as slaves.
[1288.30 → 1291.58] But let me give you just a few scenarios that opens up what I'm trying to say.
[1291.58 → 1298.20] We see people, and sometimes we are those people, who are slaves to work,
[1299.36 → 1303.68] sacrificing family, friendship, relationship, children on the altar of work.
[1304.12 → 1305.12] And we don't call that slavery.
[1305.26 → 1307.00] We call it ambitious careerism.
[1307.92 → 1309.12] We say, that guy knows what he's doing.
[1309.18 → 1310.40] That woman knows what she wants.
[1310.44 → 1311.82] She wants to go into that position.
[1312.18 → 1313.70] We sort of celebrate that.
[1313.70 → 1315.42] But they're slaves to work.
[1316.78 → 1318.94] We see people who are enslaved to sex.
[1319.04 → 1321.64] And oh my, how many examples could I give on this?
[1322.68 → 1327.62] One noteworthy example is how the porn industry continues to be the most profitable industry year after year.
[1328.04 → 1329.46] Second, by the way, is gaming.
[1330.04 → 1334.28] But we see people enslaved to sex, and we just say they're creatively expressing themselves.
[1334.94 → 1336.64] They're doing what they feel is best for themselves.
[1337.28 → 1340.80] We see people enslaved to gaming, and we say, hey, they're just having a good time.
[1340.80 → 1348.48] We see people enslaved to media, social media, and gaining all these people who like their content and follow them.
[1349.36 → 1351.42] And we say, wow, look at their platform.
[1352.92 → 1355.74] We see people enslaved to the perfect body.
[1357.12 → 1358.74] And we say, hey, this is just self-care.
[1359.08 → 1360.92] This is just a desire to look good and be beautiful.
[1362.94 → 1368.06] We see people enslaved to stuff, to material prosperity.
[1368.76 → 1370.52] We say, hey, they're trying to live a good life.
[1370.52 → 1371.24] Life is short.
[1371.96 → 1372.72] Fill in your examples.
[1372.82 → 1377.82] There's more and more and more of examples in our own culture that we can see with our own eyes of slavery.
[1379.68 → 1385.68] John Calvin had it right when he said many, many years ago, he says, the human heart is an idol-making factory.
[1385.98 → 1390.98] And what he meant by that is we take good things in creation, we elevate their value in our lives, and we begin to worship them,
[1391.06 → 1392.80] and then we become enslaved by them.
[1393.76 → 1394.70] Have you ever noticed that?
[1394.70 → 1399.34] Have you ever experienced that, where somehow we just continually take good things that God puts in this world,
[1399.50 → 1404.10] and we elevate their status, and then somehow in the process, we are so enslaved to them.
[1405.32 → 1406.34] That's our status.
[1406.34 → 1412.80] And contrary to the Western narrative that we are free people, we are so vulnerable.
[1413.64 → 1415.38] We are so easily lured.
[1415.66 → 1421.26] We are so easily seduced from the good life that God creates for us into destruction that we willingly choose,
[1421.66 → 1427.16] into slavery that we opt for and not God's good design for our lives.
[1427.16 → 1429.58] Do you know this?
[1431.22 → 1433.92] We are people who need rescue.
[1435.04 → 1439.28] You know, G.K. Chesterton, who's very, very clever, very witty, he was once asked,
[1439.60 → 1440.74] what's the problem with the world?
[1441.14 → 1441.96] You know what his answer was?
[1442.58 → 1443.76] So simple, so brief.
[1444.40 → 1445.70] I'm the problem with the world.
[1446.50 → 1447.38] What's the problem with the world?
[1447.50 → 1449.20] I'm the problem, says G.K. Chesterton.
[1451.02 → 1455.80] Let me share with you a story of when I was finishing my ordination exams to become a pastor.
[1455.80 → 1458.90] And the story might make you lose some confidence in your pastor.
[1458.98 → 1463.76] But I had to take, at the very end of my ordination exams, a comprehensive psychological evaluation.
[1464.68 → 1468.98] And the result of that psychological evaluation said, hey, this guy needs to go get some counselling.
[1470.04 → 1470.80] So I did.
[1471.64 → 1474.46] And I remember I went with a friend because, you know, misery loves company.
[1474.52 → 1476.22] I want to go with someone else who also needs counselling.
[1476.54 → 1478.04] And his session was before mine.
[1478.36 → 1480.06] And I didn't know it was an hour before mine.
[1480.10 → 1481.46] So he dropped me off in the waiting room.
[1481.52 → 1482.80] He goes to his counselling session.
[1482.80 → 1485.86] And there I am for a full hour, probably more like an hour and a half.
[1485.94 → 1486.76] I didn't bring my laptop.
[1486.98 → 1487.92] I didn't bring a cell phone.
[1488.14 → 1489.14] I didn't even bring schoolwork.
[1489.20 → 1495.70] And so there I was in this big waiting room, because it was a big counselling practice, waiting for an hour and 15 minutes.
[1495.76 → 1498.38] And if you know me, you know that I'm a people watcher.
[1498.68 → 1499.58] I love public transit.
[1499.66 → 1500.30] I love airports.
[1501.38 → 1506.16] And so there I am in this waiting room for an hour and 15 minutes or so, just observing.
[1507.26 → 1510.60] And if you've been in a counselling office, you know that it's a place of great vulnerability, right?
[1510.60 → 1512.86] I remember a young woman coming out of one of her sessions.
[1512.96 → 1513.64] She had a little baby.
[1514.04 → 1517.46] And my guess was that she was going through some serious postpartum depression.
[1518.42 → 1520.54] I saw several couples come and go.
[1520.60 → 1523.98] And you could feel the tension between them in their marriage, in their relationship.
[1524.14 → 1525.14] You could cut it with a knife.
[1525.82 → 1527.24] I saw family units come in.
[1527.28 → 1530.10] And you could just see the tension between parents and their teenage children.
[1530.24 → 1531.70] They're trying to sort some stuff out.
[1532.34 → 1534.84] I saw several singles of varieties of ages.
[1534.84 → 1538.06] And I'm guessing some of them were facing serious diagnoses.
[1538.98 → 1540.90] Some of them were facing serious mental health challenges.
[1541.44 → 1543.20] But there I was for an hour and 15 minutes.
[1543.26 → 1547.80] And I have to say, at the end of that, I felt this collective sense of our brokenness.
[1548.36 → 1549.84] And I include myself in that.
[1550.12 → 1551.56] I was told to go to counselling.
[1551.62 → 1552.06] Remember that?
[1552.42 → 1555.78] We were sitting there, and I just felt the deep vulnerability of the human condition.
[1556.14 → 1557.66] We all had our mess.
[1557.92 → 1559.82] We all were facing all sorts of challenges.
[1559.82 → 1562.74] We all were enslaved in one way or another.
[1562.88 → 1567.86] And man, did we need healing, rescue.
[1572.38 → 1581.12] The God that we meet in Exodus 15 is a Redeemer God who just can't leave it alone.
[1581.96 → 1585.78] He just can't stay back and watch slavery.
[1586.04 → 1587.22] He had to do something.
[1587.22 → 1589.74] Out of His love for His people, out of His commitment to His people,
[1590.06 → 1591.70] and out of a love for His world,
[1592.16 → 1596.30] and a promise to bring shalom and blessing and restoration to the world.
[1597.16 → 1601.62] And so He has to get His hands dirty and rescue this slave nation from Egypt.
[1603.12 → 1605.30] And in the same way, God meets Moses.
[1606.34 → 1609.64] And He says, I've heard the cries of my people in slavery.
[1610.16 → 1613.10] And so I have decided to come down and rescue them.
[1613.90 → 1615.44] So it is with the cross.
[1615.44 → 1623.56] Where God in Christ says, I have heard the cries of my people in slavery, our cries.
[1623.56 → 1631.52] And I have decided to come down and to rescue them once and for all.
[1632.56 → 1637.72] And when we see Jesus on the cross, hands extended, receiving the wrath of the God,
[1637.84 → 1640.68] receiving the justice for our sin, we see a God who says,
[1640.68 → 1644.06] this is how far I'll go to be your redeemer.
[1644.82 → 1649.34] This is the extent to which I will self-sacrifice to bring your freedom,
[1649.92 → 1654.16] to liberate you economically, politically, socially, sexually, and spiritually.
[1654.36 → 1658.46] This is how far I'll go to redeem a people enslaved.
[1658.46 → 1664.92] And the good news for every person who lives is that this forgiveness is available.
[1665.84 → 1667.70] This restoration is available.
[1668.52 → 1672.74] This redemption is available, no matter how far gone you think you are.
[1677.02 → 1678.92] Galatians 4, now I'll read it.
[1679.34 → 1679.74] We read,
[1679.74 → 1684.74] God sent His Son, born of a woman under the law to what?
[1685.82 → 1686.34] Redeem.
[1687.24 → 1691.56] Those under the law that we might be received adoption to son ship.
[1692.00 → 1695.74] Because you are His sons, God sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts,
[1695.82 → 1697.28] the Spirit who calls out,
[1697.76 → 1699.04] Abba, Father.
[1699.68 → 1703.12] So you are no longer slaves, but God's children.
[1703.74 → 1707.72] And since you are His children, He has also made you heirs.
[1709.74 → 1712.50] And it shouldn't surprise you that when you talk to someone who comes to faith,
[1712.56 → 1714.66] and a number of you, I've heard your story even in this church.
[1714.92 → 1718.40] When you describe coming to faith in Jesus, you describe it as being set free.
[1719.60 → 1722.66] You describe it as being released from slavery.
[1722.84 → 1726.78] You describe it as being saved from bondage.
[1727.60 → 1728.48] That's the gospel.
[1729.46 → 1731.28] That's the work of Jesus coming into our lives.
[1731.34 → 1733.74] That's the kingdom breaking in.
[1735.06 → 1736.66] And as we're going to see in the next couple of weeks,
[1736.66 → 1740.02] Jesus, I should say, God in Exodus,
[1740.86 → 1743.00] never rescues a people just for their own sake.
[1743.64 → 1746.58] He never rescues them just so they can do their own little thing off to the side.
[1746.66 → 1748.70] What we're going to see is God binding Himself in love,
[1748.82 → 1749.80] God teaching them His ways,
[1749.88 → 1750.56] and then what does He do?
[1750.80 → 1754.12] He places Israel right in the centre of the ancient Near East.
[1754.24 → 1754.48] Why?
[1755.36 → 1757.58] So that all the nations can see,
[1758.28 → 1759.54] watch, and observe
[1759.54 → 1761.12] the freedom
[1761.12 → 1763.92] that Israel experiences with God as their Lord.
[1763.92 → 1765.80] And in the same way,
[1765.90 → 1767.84] Jesus, who rescues us from our bondage,
[1768.06 → 1768.88] He sets us free,
[1768.94 → 1770.18] and He sends us out to whom?
[1770.30 → 1770.88] The nations.
[1771.90 → 1772.76] In His power,
[1773.20 → 1774.10] by His Spirit,
[1774.22 → 1774.88] to live out,
[1774.96 → 1775.40] even here,
[1775.50 → 1776.44] even in Clayton Heights,
[1777.24 → 1777.72] our freedom.
[1779.02 → 1779.80] And I'm convinced,
[1780.44 → 1781.80] as I've said before from this pulpit,
[1781.88 → 1783.18] that our neighbours are not all ears
[1783.18 → 1784.42] listening to what we have to say.
[1784.96 → 1785.94] They're all eyes
[1785.94 → 1788.72] watching to see if the freedom we talk about in Jesus
[1788.72 → 1790.54] is actually embodied in our lives.
[1790.54 → 1793.96] because that speaks of the freedom we have in Him.
[1796.88 → 1799.08] And what the people of Israel were to do,
[1799.30 → 1800.62] and as the churches too as well,
[1800.68 → 1801.78] is to invite the nations,
[1801.92 → 1803.66] not just into relationship with the living God
[1803.66 → 1804.54] who's come in Christ,
[1805.02 → 1807.14] but into worship.
[1808.72 → 1809.60] A number of years ago,
[1809.62 → 1810.26] I was reading a book,
[1810.34 → 1812.00] and I love this little line where it says,
[1812.40 → 1815.24] missions exist because worship doesn't.
[1816.56 → 1818.18] Missions exist because worship doesn't.
[1818.22 → 1818.92] Do you get that line?
[1818.92 → 1820.00] That is to say,
[1820.10 → 1821.44] the whole reason we share the gospel,
[1821.54 → 1822.84] the whole reason we make known Jesus,
[1823.08 → 1824.78] is because these people haven't yet experienced
[1824.78 → 1826.40] and responded to the good news
[1826.40 → 1828.10] of what Jesus has done on the cross.
[1828.36 → 1829.52] And once they do,
[1830.28 → 1831.42] the response is,
[1832.38 → 1832.64] worship.
[1833.78 → 1834.90] And there will come a day
[1834.90 → 1837.36] where missions will come to an end,
[1837.86 → 1839.56] and worship will endure forever.
[1840.30 → 1841.74] And I'll just read you a quote from that book
[1841.74 → 1842.24] where it says,
[1842.36 → 1844.06] the goal of missions is worship.
[1844.06 → 1845.44] And there will come a day
[1845.44 → 1847.46] where the nations will be invited in
[1847.46 → 1849.80] to the white-hot enjoyment
[1849.80 → 1851.58] of God's glory.
[1853.32 → 1854.00] Let's pray.
[1860.18 → 1862.30] Father, we begin just wanting to thank you
[1862.30 → 1864.42] for the rescue.
[1866.36 → 1867.48] Thank you that you're a God
[1867.48 → 1868.86] who doesn't stand at a distance.
[1869.92 → 1871.16] You're not disinterested,
[1871.16 → 1873.36] and you certainly aren't powerless.
[1875.18 → 1877.06] We thank you for the empty grave.
[1877.92 → 1879.68] We thank you that the kingdom has come.
[1880.42 → 1881.90] And we thank you for the hope
[1881.90 → 1883.78] that you are coming again
[1883.78 → 1885.54] to restore all things.
[1886.12 → 1887.04] You are coming again
[1887.04 → 1888.54] to end oppression for good.
[1889.10 → 1889.98] You are coming again
[1889.98 → 1891.84] to wipe the tears from our eyes.
[1891.84 → 1893.34] And we pray, Lord,
[1893.40 → 1894.10] as we wait,
[1895.18 → 1896.80] as we live under the rule of Jesus,
[1897.50 → 1898.74] that we would have hope
[1898.74 → 1899.72] that that day is coming.
[1900.82 → 1901.92] We pray that our neighbours
[1901.92 → 1902.78] would not just hear,
[1903.74 → 1904.84] but that they would see
[1904.84 → 1906.70] the good news of the gospel,
[1907.70 → 1909.12] the freedom Jesus brings.
[1910.12 → 1910.40] Amen.
[1914.00 → 1915.30] I invite you now to stand
[1915.30 → 1916.94] and sing our song of response.
[1917.60 → 1918.56] And I want you to pay attention
[1918.56 → 1919.32] to verse two,
[1919.84 → 1920.98] how it is a declaration
[1920.98 → 1922.18] that in Christ
[1922.18 → 1923.54] there is freedom renewal
[1923.54 → 1924.42] for the poor,
[1924.56 → 1925.12] the oppressed.
[1925.56 → 1926.26] Let's sing together.
[1930.46 → 1931.58] Let's sing this one out.
[1932.80 → 1933.20] Ready?
[1934.78 → 1935.24] All right.
[1935.24 → 1935.28] All right.
