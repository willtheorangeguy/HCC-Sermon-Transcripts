[0.00 --> 22.20]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[22.28 --> 23.50]  We can say good morning again.
[23.68 --> 25.06]  We said good morning for the last two weeks
[25.06 --> 25.92]  when it wasn't the morning.
[26.74 --> 29.98]  I'm going to take a moment to pin my notes down
[29.98 --> 31.32]  so they don't fly away on me.
[31.78 --> 33.44]  I will learn from my mistakes last week.
[33.64 --> 35.96]  Although, you got a shorter sermon last week
[35.96 --> 37.50]  because of this, so maybe there are benefits.
[48.50 --> 49.76]  Well, before we open the scripture,
[49.90 --> 52.94]  I just want to say a word about this service
[52.94 --> 54.84]  and that you didn't get to see the video.
[54.96 --> 56.28]  So if you want to see the video of the people
[56.28 --> 58.36]  who shared earlier, you can go online afterwards.
[58.36 --> 62.28]  But you may or may not know that last year over COVID,
[62.36 --> 64.20]  we had a number of people leave our church
[64.20 --> 66.16]  and they didn't leave because of COVID.
[66.86 --> 68.70]  They didn't leave because of Pastor Sid's preaching,
[68.82 --> 70.12]  which is normally the reason they leave.
[70.92 --> 71.88]  That was a joke.
[72.08 --> 73.02]  It's usually my preaching.
[73.60 --> 75.42]  They left because God was sending them
[75.42 --> 76.48]  to different parts of the world
[76.48 --> 78.00]  and to serve in teaching,
[78.10 --> 79.38]  to serve in translation work,
[79.44 --> 80.66]  to serve in evangelism.
[81.24 --> 83.28]  And even as they left, we prayed for them
[83.28 --> 84.58]  and we sent them with our blessing.
[84.58 --> 87.78]  I felt a sense that God was connecting our church
[87.78 --> 89.94]  to global missions, to the global church.
[90.48 --> 91.66]  And if you've been around Hope for a while,
[91.74 --> 94.00]  you know that we really emphasize being a local church,
[94.46 --> 95.60]  being engaged in our city,
[95.72 --> 97.34]  loving Clayton, where we live, where we serve.
[98.06 --> 100.14]  And yet I really did sense that through these people
[100.14 --> 102.20]  who came to our church from so many different places,
[102.74 --> 104.06]  God's saying, remember that you
[104.06 --> 105.58]  and your little corner of British Columbia
[105.58 --> 110.28]  are part of this massive, worldwide, multi-ethnic church.
[110.28 --> 112.28]  And this morning we want to celebrate that.
[112.36 --> 113.86]  We want to pray for the church abroad.
[114.46 --> 115.62]  And we want to spend time,
[115.68 --> 116.90]  even as we look at the word,
[117.54 --> 119.74]  at a prayer that is really not just for the Western church,
[119.82 --> 121.56]  but a prayer for the global church
[121.56 --> 122.78]  that comes from the book of Acts.
[123.02 --> 124.08]  So if you have your Bible,
[124.24 --> 125.46]  if you've got your phone or tablet,
[125.54 --> 128.40]  I do invite you to turn with me to Acts chapter four.
[128.52 --> 129.34]  We're going to read a prayer
[129.34 --> 130.94]  that comes from the early church
[130.94 --> 132.32]  as it meets resistance,
[132.48 --> 133.50]  as it's sharing the gospel,
[133.70 --> 135.94]  as it's sort of experiencing its first level of threat
[135.94 --> 137.80]  in making known the name of Jesus.
[137.80 --> 140.70]  So this is Acts four, starting at verse 23.
[141.90 --> 143.12]  And just to give you some background,
[143.78 --> 145.14]  there's a healing that happened
[145.14 --> 147.82]  and the religious leaders sort of pulled in
[147.82 --> 148.56]  some of the disciples.
[148.72 --> 150.08]  They threatened them, they imprisoned them.
[150.32 --> 152.28]  And after they were let go,
[152.80 --> 154.06]  they go to the other disciples
[154.06 --> 156.42]  and this is where we pick up in the story.
[160.74 --> 162.06]  On their release,
[162.48 --> 164.40]  Peter and John went back to their own people
[164.40 --> 167.02]  and reported all that the chief priests
[167.02 --> 168.34]  and elders had said to them.
[169.22 --> 170.48]  When they heard this,
[170.60 --> 173.44]  they raised their voices together in prayer to God.
[174.38 --> 175.64]  Sovereign Lord, they said,
[175.70 --> 177.86]  you made the heaven and the earth and the sea,
[178.44 --> 179.68]  everything in them.
[180.04 --> 181.98]  You spoke by the Holy Spirit
[181.98 --> 183.40]  through the mouth of your servants,
[183.56 --> 184.50]  our father David.
[185.50 --> 187.32]  Why do the nations rage
[187.32 --> 189.84]  and the people plot in vain?
[190.28 --> 191.98]  The kings of the earth rise up
[191.98 --> 194.10]  and the rulers band together against the Lord
[194.10 --> 195.96]  and against his anointed one.
[196.88 --> 198.46]  Indeed, Herod and Pontius Pilate
[198.46 --> 199.84]  met together with the Gentiles
[199.84 --> 201.50]  and the people of Israel in this city
[201.50 --> 204.14]  to conspire against your holy servant Jesus,
[204.36 --> 205.24]  whom you anointed.
[206.26 --> 208.32]  They did what your power and will
[208.32 --> 210.54]  had determined beforehand should happen.
[211.52 --> 214.06]  Now, Lord, consider their threats
[214.06 --> 215.68]  and enable your servants
[215.68 --> 217.70]  to speak your word with great boldness.
[218.56 --> 220.06]  Stretch out your hand to heal
[220.06 --> 221.96]  and perform signs and wonders
[221.96 --> 224.10]  through the name of your holy servant Jesus.
[225.64 --> 226.76]  After they prayed,
[227.28 --> 229.02]  the place where they were meeting was shaken
[229.02 --> 231.74]  and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit
[231.74 --> 235.08]  and spoke the word of God boldly.
[235.86 --> 237.64]  So far, the reading of God's word.
[241.44 --> 244.14]  Over the last two months or so,
[244.28 --> 246.24]  actually since we started our Revelation series,
[246.38 --> 247.32]  I've been working my way
[247.32 --> 248.60]  through the World Watch List.
[248.60 --> 249.74]  We emailed that out to you
[249.74 --> 251.32]  and I know some of you are working through it too.
[251.92 --> 252.94]  And if you're unfamiliar with it,
[252.98 --> 253.90]  the World Watch List
[253.90 --> 256.54]  is a prayer guide for the churches
[256.54 --> 259.12]  in the 50 most dangerous countries.
[260.08 --> 261.20]  And it tells you stories
[261.20 --> 262.34]  of what it's like for those churches,
[262.54 --> 263.86]  how we're supposed to pray for them.
[264.60 --> 266.10]  And I'll say that day by day,
[266.24 --> 266.84]  week by week,
[266.88 --> 268.20]  as I've been praying for these churches
[268.20 --> 268.94]  around the world,
[269.04 --> 269.88]  some of which, Sonia,
[269.96 --> 270.98]  I appreciate you naming,
[271.84 --> 273.14]  it's been eye-opening for me.
[273.86 --> 275.38]  It's been sobering for me.
[275.46 --> 276.60]  And I think you can attest
[276.60 --> 278.42]  to a lot of what I experience here in Canada,
[278.48 --> 279.60]  that it's very safe
[279.60 --> 281.22]  to be a Christian here.
[281.86 --> 283.18]  And yet when you read about the churches
[283.18 --> 284.34]  in a number of countries,
[284.40 --> 285.58]  you realize it's not safe.
[286.24 --> 286.98]  It's not easy.
[287.80 --> 289.44]  Many of them are running for their lives.
[289.74 --> 291.38]  Many of them are running from their families.
[292.02 --> 293.30]  Many of them are persecuted
[293.30 --> 295.40]  by corrupt leaders and corrupt laws.
[295.96 --> 297.26]  Many of them, even right now,
[297.30 --> 299.46]  are being withheld vaccinations for COVID
[299.46 --> 301.88]  because they believe in Jesus.
[301.88 --> 304.40]  And as I pray for these countries,
[304.80 --> 307.02]  I find myself at the end of my devotional time
[307.02 --> 307.62]  praying for them,
[307.70 --> 310.06]  just kind of quietly praying to God,
[310.46 --> 311.34]  how long,
[311.64 --> 314.74]  how long will churches around the world
[314.74 --> 316.28]  experience this kind of persecution
[316.28 --> 317.72]  and hate,
[318.58 --> 319.22]  violence,
[320.00 --> 320.44]  and oppression?
[320.94 --> 324.96]  How long will you let so much evil take place?
[325.02 --> 326.52]  Not just in the world in general,
[326.62 --> 328.38]  but also specifically against the church
[328.38 --> 329.88]  that names Christ as Lord.
[329.88 --> 334.32]  Yet, at the same time,
[334.40 --> 335.22]  over the last few weeks,
[335.28 --> 336.56]  I've been praying for these churches.
[337.10 --> 338.64]  I've been deeply encouraged.
[339.64 --> 340.46]  And I've been encouraged
[340.46 --> 341.98]  because in so many of these cases,
[342.28 --> 343.78]  even despite the circumstances,
[343.94 --> 344.82]  what I'm learning is that
[344.82 --> 347.40]  these churches are not just surviving,
[348.24 --> 348.92]  they're thriving.
[350.42 --> 351.68]  And perhaps you've read
[351.68 --> 352.68]  about global Christianity
[352.68 --> 353.76]  over the last 50 years.
[353.88 --> 355.78]  Perhaps you know anecdotally some stories,
[356.18 --> 356.86]  but you should know that
[356.86 --> 358.82]  in some of the most unlikely places,
[358.82 --> 361.64]  and some of the most persecuted places,
[362.42 --> 364.04]  the churches are planting more churches.
[365.44 --> 367.22]  The churches are growing
[367.22 --> 368.50]  in staggering numbers.
[369.68 --> 370.48]  And although it's true
[370.48 --> 371.46]  that here in the West,
[371.98 --> 373.52]  in places like North America and Europe,
[373.70 --> 374.44]  many, many churches
[374.44 --> 375.62]  are either stagnating
[375.62 --> 376.90]  or they're in rapid decline,
[376.96 --> 377.92]  and there's a sense of fear
[377.92 --> 378.86]  that the church is shrinking,
[379.42 --> 380.82]  the global church is growing.
[381.00 --> 381.66]  Did you know that?
[381.66 --> 384.62]  And I've been reading
[384.62 --> 385.44]  a fair bit this week
[385.44 --> 386.58]  even about the global church.
[387.46 --> 388.88]  I'm just waiting for my microphone.
[390.38 --> 390.64]  Yeah?
[391.52 --> 392.62]  You guys can hear me okay?
[394.68 --> 395.68]  I'll pause and just say
[395.68 --> 396.72]  thank you to the media team.
[396.82 --> 398.30]  I see like a rat's nest of wires
[398.30 --> 399.12]  and capable people
[399.12 --> 399.90]  behind these computers,
[400.18 --> 401.46]  and I very much appreciate it.
[405.26 --> 406.02]  But you should know
[406.02 --> 407.18]  that in the global church right now,
[407.24 --> 407.98]  the average Christian
[407.98 --> 408.68]  looks very different
[408.68 --> 409.44]  than you might expect.
[409.44 --> 410.46]  In fact, they say
[410.46 --> 412.02]  that the center of Christianity
[412.02 --> 412.96]  has moved south,
[413.02 --> 414.94]  in the global south of our world.
[415.44 --> 416.30]  And the average Christian
[416.30 --> 417.38]  isn't someone who looks like
[417.38 --> 418.26]  you and me here this morning.
[418.32 --> 418.84]  The average Christian
[418.84 --> 420.64]  is actually a Latin American
[420.64 --> 422.86]  or an African woman
[422.86 --> 423.98]  in a big family
[423.98 --> 425.82]  living in a remote village
[425.82 --> 426.78]  that's quite poor,
[427.46 --> 428.36]  serving her family,
[428.54 --> 429.32]  serving her city,
[429.74 --> 430.64]  worshiping with her church.
[430.70 --> 431.98]  That's the average Christian
[431.98 --> 432.58]  in the world.
[433.38 --> 434.58]  And what might really blow your mind
[434.58 --> 435.78]  if you don't already know this
[435.78 --> 437.64]  is that missionaries
[437.64 --> 438.32]  are not just sent
[438.32 --> 439.20]  from a few countries
[439.20 --> 440.30]  that are Western anymore.
[440.82 --> 441.56]  Missionaries are sent
[441.56 --> 442.80]  from all sorts of countries
[442.80 --> 443.98]  to all sorts of places
[443.98 --> 444.60]  in the world.
[445.44 --> 446.34]  Right now,
[446.86 --> 448.16]  there are Brazilian missionaries,
[448.26 --> 448.76]  which by the way,
[448.84 --> 449.92]  Brazil is the missionary
[449.92 --> 451.56]  sending center right now.
[451.62 --> 452.10]  More missionaries
[452.10 --> 452.66]  come from Brazil
[452.66 --> 453.34]  than anywhere else.
[453.56 --> 454.60]  And they're sending missionaries
[454.60 --> 455.78]  to Berlin.
[456.72 --> 458.32]  And there are Filipino missionaries
[458.32 --> 459.66]  being sent to Tokyo.
[460.06 --> 461.68]  And there are Nigerian missionaries,
[461.76 --> 462.48]  you ready for this?
[462.98 --> 464.54]  Being sent to Toronto
[464.54 --> 466.36]  and New York City.
[467.32 --> 469.22]  The world has changed
[469.22 --> 471.20]  in regards to missionary work.
[471.98 --> 473.26]  And so has the nature
[473.26 --> 474.24]  of global Christianity.
[474.42 --> 475.22]  And some of the hardest,
[475.38 --> 476.34]  most difficult places
[476.34 --> 477.80]  is precisely where
[477.80 --> 478.58]  the church is growing.
[479.22 --> 479.92]  And I don't know
[479.92 --> 480.84]  how that sits with you,
[481.16 --> 482.56]  but when I hear that
[482.56 --> 483.14]  in some of the most
[483.14 --> 484.68]  persecuted, dangerous places,
[484.88 --> 486.58]  that those are the places
[486.58 --> 487.58]  where the church is growing
[487.58 --> 488.22]  and planting
[488.22 --> 489.64]  and sending Christians
[489.64 --> 490.42]  and missionaries,
[490.42 --> 491.96]  I can't help but stop
[491.96 --> 492.48]  and say,
[493.12 --> 495.00]  I'm being told to step back.
[496.78 --> 497.74]  Is that better, Greg?
[498.70 --> 500.08]  I can't help but think,
[500.34 --> 501.30]  as I think of the dynamic
[501.30 --> 501.96]  of persecution
[501.96 --> 502.72]  and yet the fact
[502.72 --> 503.44]  that the church is growing,
[503.56 --> 505.20]  that the gospel has power.
[506.38 --> 507.64]  Would you not agree with me
[507.64 --> 509.12]  that as we look at
[509.12 --> 510.18]  where the church is growing,
[510.24 --> 511.20]  that nobody predicted,
[511.90 --> 513.44]  we have to stop and marvel
[513.44 --> 514.32]  at the fact that
[514.32 --> 515.36]  this is not just a message
[515.36 --> 516.26]  with human words,
[516.46 --> 518.28]  that Jesus by the Spirit
[518.28 --> 519.48]  through the church
[519.48 --> 520.98]  is on the move,
[521.72 --> 523.24]  that ordinary Christians
[523.24 --> 524.38]  and their ordinary lives
[524.38 --> 525.38]  in remote places
[525.38 --> 527.40]  and many, many poor places
[527.40 --> 528.84]  is growing the church.
[529.46 --> 531.22]  The Spirit of the living God
[531.22 --> 532.08]  has been poured out
[532.08 --> 532.64]  on the church,
[533.04 --> 533.58]  and Jesus,
[533.72 --> 534.84]  when He ascended to heaven,
[535.20 --> 536.36]  did not abandon us,
[536.60 --> 537.56]  but equipped us
[537.56 --> 539.10]  by the power of the Holy Spirit
[539.10 --> 540.54]  to make known the gospel.
[540.86 --> 541.64]  And it's happening.
[542.40 --> 544.58]  It's happening all over the world.
[544.96 --> 545.30]  And yes,
[545.36 --> 547.32]  it's also happening here.
[547.32 --> 550.30]  And I hope as you listen even,
[550.54 --> 551.36]  if you were able to hear
[551.36 --> 552.82]  the words from Dylan and Hannah,
[553.32 --> 554.98]  as you heard from Megan and Grace
[554.98 --> 556.66]  and Barnabas and Sophia,
[556.82 --> 559.42]  that you hear the gospel going out,
[559.60 --> 560.68]  the sending of people
[560.68 --> 561.82]  all over the world
[561.82 --> 563.06]  to make known the name of Jesus.
[564.96 --> 566.80]  The passage that we are looking at
[566.80 --> 568.02]  in Acts chapter 4
[568.02 --> 569.82]  is really the beginning
[569.82 --> 570.82]  of narrating
[570.82 --> 571.86]  how the gospel is going out
[571.86 --> 573.38]  from Jerusalem to Judea
[573.38 --> 574.06]  to Samaria
[574.06 --> 575.08]  to British Columbia.
[575.08 --> 580.20]  And I say British Columbia
[580.20 --> 581.04]  because I'm convinced
[581.04 --> 581.90]  that if the apostles
[581.90 --> 582.78]  had a world map
[582.78 --> 583.84]  starting with Jerusalem
[583.84 --> 584.34]  in the middle,
[584.94 --> 585.74]  we would be
[585.74 --> 586.58]  at the ends of the earth.
[586.62 --> 587.74]  They would see this blob
[587.74 --> 589.18]  of land in British Columbia
[589.18 --> 589.82]  and that's the ends
[589.82 --> 590.50]  of the earth to them.
[590.54 --> 591.16]  And we marvel
[591.16 --> 592.24]  at the fact that we're here.
[592.96 --> 594.42]  We're here as the church
[594.42 --> 595.74]  at the ends of the earth
[595.74 --> 596.94]  in some sense.
[598.04 --> 598.88]  But we're going to look
[598.88 --> 599.42]  at a passage
[599.42 --> 600.58]  that shows not only
[600.58 --> 601.80]  the beginning of the growth,
[602.24 --> 602.98]  the Spirit sort of
[602.98 --> 603.94]  sending believers out
[603.94 --> 604.80]  to share the gospel
[604.80 --> 605.46]  in their words
[605.46 --> 606.16]  and in their deeds,
[606.48 --> 607.90]  seeing Jesus perform miracles,
[608.08 --> 608.56]  seeing the Spirit
[608.56 --> 609.26]  do things they never
[609.26 --> 610.06]  thought was possible.
[610.38 --> 611.48]  We're also going to see
[611.48 --> 612.50]  how right off the hop
[612.50 --> 613.16]  there's resistance.
[613.98 --> 614.96]  There's imprisonment.
[615.76 --> 616.66]  There's people saying,
[616.82 --> 617.38]  please don't speak
[617.38 --> 618.16]  the name of Jesus.
[618.88 --> 619.60]  Please don't share
[619.60 --> 620.42]  this good news you have.
[620.50 --> 621.14]  Keep it to yourself.
[621.56 --> 622.20]  And you see right
[622.20 --> 622.64]  at the beginning
[622.64 --> 623.28]  in Acts 4
[623.28 --> 624.70]  the power of the Spirit
[624.70 --> 625.40]  equipping the church
[625.40 --> 626.40]  and the resistance
[626.40 --> 627.32]  against the church
[627.32 --> 627.98]  coming together.
[628.62 --> 629.52]  And I think the prayer
[629.52 --> 630.18]  that we have here
[630.18 --> 630.86]  in Acts 4
[630.86 --> 632.18]  is a prayer
[632.18 --> 632.94]  that's given voice
[632.94 --> 633.64]  to many believers
[633.64 --> 634.28]  around the world
[634.28 --> 635.20]  throughout the generations
[635.20 --> 636.58]  because it's a prayer
[636.58 --> 637.00]  for a church
[637.00 --> 638.26]  that receives threats
[638.26 --> 640.04]  but prays for boldness.
[640.56 --> 641.06]  For churches
[641.06 --> 642.24]  that are receiving resistance
[642.24 --> 644.10]  but ask for power.
[644.92 --> 645.78]  And I think that this
[645.78 --> 646.40]  has been the prayer
[646.40 --> 646.94]  for the church
[646.94 --> 648.02]  throughout the generations
[648.02 --> 648.76]  and it will be
[648.76 --> 649.84]  until Jesus returns.
[650.40 --> 650.98]  And so let's take
[650.98 --> 651.64]  a close look
[651.64 --> 652.32]  at this prayer.
[653.32 --> 654.08]  It starts with Peter
[654.08 --> 655.08]  and John being released
[655.08 --> 656.30]  from the religious leaders
[656.30 --> 657.16]  who are questioning them
[657.16 --> 657.86]  and they go back.
[658.08 --> 658.88]  They report everything
[658.88 --> 659.62]  that happened to them
[659.62 --> 660.42]  right from the healing
[660.42 --> 661.26]  to imprisonment
[661.26 --> 662.10]  to being threatened
[662.10 --> 662.80]  and then telling
[662.80 --> 663.54]  the religious leaders
[663.54 --> 665.18]  we can't stop speaking about
[665.18 --> 666.08]  we can't stop sharing
[666.08 --> 667.10]  about what we've seen
[667.10 --> 668.14]  and what we've heard.
[668.46 --> 669.28]  And what's the first thing
[669.28 --> 670.04]  the church does?
[670.78 --> 671.64]  What's the first thing
[671.64 --> 672.60]  they do after they hear
[672.60 --> 673.58]  the news of what's happened?
[675.90 --> 676.74]  They pray.
[677.90 --> 679.28]  They don't grumble together.
[679.86 --> 680.48]  They don't start
[680.48 --> 682.02]  strategizing for revenge.
[682.32 --> 682.96]  They pray.
[683.40 --> 684.42]  The posture of the church
[684.42 --> 685.32]  in the midst of threat
[685.32 --> 686.32]  as they receive these
[686.32 --> 688.10]  pretty serious people
[688.10 --> 689.34]  in positions of power
[689.34 --> 690.58]  saying you're in trouble
[690.58 --> 691.60]  if this keeps going out.
[692.04 --> 692.98]  Their posture is prayer.
[693.66 --> 694.50]  And we learn a lot
[694.50 --> 695.68]  about their prayer here too.
[696.06 --> 697.12]  They don't pray for revenge.
[697.20 --> 698.20]  They don't ask for sort of
[698.20 --> 698.86]  just strategize
[698.86 --> 699.62]  to get back at them.
[699.88 --> 701.96]  They pray for boldness.
[702.00 --> 702.78]  But what's the first thing
[702.78 --> 703.12]  they do?
[703.90 --> 704.90]  How does their prayer start?
[706.70 --> 708.12]  It starts by talking
[708.12 --> 710.02]  and reminding themselves
[710.02 --> 710.88]  of who God is.
[711.16 --> 712.28]  The prayer starts by saying
[712.28 --> 713.76]  Lord you made the heavens
[713.76 --> 714.40]  and the earth
[714.40 --> 715.44]  the sea and everything
[715.44 --> 715.98]  in them.
[715.98 --> 717.98]  This prayer begins
[717.98 --> 718.58]  by acknowledging
[718.58 --> 719.68]  that in spite of
[719.68 --> 720.34]  the difficulty
[720.34 --> 722.04]  God holds the world
[722.04 --> 724.10]  and God holds the church.
[724.54 --> 725.94]  There's a deep trust here
[725.94 --> 727.22]  in the sovereignty of God
[727.22 --> 728.60]  that despite the chaos
[728.60 --> 729.72]  and the pain
[729.72 --> 731.04]  He's in control.
[731.76 --> 732.38]  And they're praying
[732.38 --> 732.98]  to the one
[732.98 --> 734.68]  who does hold the world
[734.68 --> 735.30]  in His hands.
[735.36 --> 735.86]  And you'll see that
[735.86 --> 736.68]  the sovereignty of God
[736.68 --> 737.70]  is a major theme
[737.70 --> 738.22]  in this prayer.
[738.22 --> 739.36]  There's a sense of trust
[739.36 --> 740.60]  that undergirds the risk
[740.60 --> 742.60]  that God holds the world.
[743.52 --> 744.36]  But then we get
[744.36 --> 744.96]  to the question.
[745.16 --> 746.08]  They quote Psalm 2.
[746.40 --> 747.42]  It's the Psalm of David
[747.42 --> 748.74]  and they say,
[749.18 --> 750.56]  Why do the nations rage?
[751.20 --> 752.52]  The peoples plot in vain.
[752.60 --> 753.94]  The kings of the earth rise up.
[754.00 --> 755.48]  The rulers band together
[755.48 --> 756.28]  against the Lord
[756.28 --> 757.92]  and against His anointed one.
[758.64 --> 759.70]  And they're really asking
[759.70 --> 760.60]  the age-old question.
[760.68 --> 761.86]  If God is sovereign,
[762.66 --> 763.50]  He's holding the world
[763.50 --> 764.50]  and the church in His hand,
[764.96 --> 766.56]  why do the nations rage?
[767.00 --> 768.12]  Why are corrupt leaders
[768.12 --> 768.68]  in power?
[769.06 --> 770.54]  Why do people who hate the church
[770.54 --> 771.42]  persecute the church?
[771.42 --> 772.94]  Why does this happen?
[774.32 --> 775.36]  That's a good question.
[776.32 --> 776.78]  And there's believers
[776.78 --> 777.38]  around the world
[777.38 --> 778.20]  at this very moment
[778.20 --> 778.70]  as they gather
[778.70 --> 779.54]  on Pentecost Sunday.
[779.72 --> 781.10]  They're legitimately asking
[781.10 --> 781.88]  that for themselves.
[782.78 --> 783.52]  They're wondering
[783.52 --> 784.90]  why it has to be this way.
[785.02 --> 786.08]  Why it is so hard
[786.08 --> 786.82]  to be a believer
[786.82 --> 787.86]  in Somalia
[787.86 --> 789.26]  and North Korea
[789.26 --> 790.38]  and China
[790.38 --> 791.32]  and Nigeria
[791.32 --> 792.38]  and more.
[793.78 --> 794.56]  And in some sense,
[794.62 --> 795.00]  you might say
[795.00 --> 796.12]  this passage doesn't answer
[796.12 --> 796.66]  the question.
[797.58 --> 798.56]  But I think it does
[798.56 --> 799.32]  in two ways
[799.32 --> 800.32]  that I think are very profound.
[800.32 --> 800.94]  One is,
[801.48 --> 802.40]  God is sovereign.
[802.88 --> 803.62]  And even as it talks
[803.62 --> 804.60]  about the nations raging,
[804.78 --> 805.64]  the rulers conspiring
[805.64 --> 806.76]  against the anointed one,
[806.96 --> 807.76]  what do we read
[807.76 --> 808.46]  in this passage?
[809.02 --> 810.18]  That all that happened
[810.18 --> 812.10]  happened as God's power
[812.10 --> 813.48]  had decided beforehand
[813.48 --> 814.16]  should happen.
[814.96 --> 815.50]  That is to say,
[815.56 --> 816.16]  even Jesus,
[816.48 --> 817.62]  who Himself shared
[817.62 --> 818.26]  in suffering,
[818.70 --> 819.46]  was persecuted
[819.46 --> 820.18]  and crucified
[820.18 --> 820.98]  and died,
[821.56 --> 822.46]  all that injustice
[822.46 --> 823.00]  and pain
[823.00 --> 823.76]  and wrongdoing
[823.76 --> 825.30]  was guided by God's
[825.30 --> 825.74]  holy hand
[825.74 --> 826.36]  who accomplished
[826.36 --> 827.20]  His good purposes
[827.20 --> 828.52]  in spite of the evil,
[828.92 --> 830.10]  in spite of the wrong.
[830.66 --> 831.68]  That's a powerful thing.
[832.88 --> 833.54]  So in some sense,
[833.58 --> 834.36]  the answer in the first place
[834.36 --> 835.52]  is God is sovereign still.
[835.78 --> 836.36]  But secondly,
[836.78 --> 837.46]  I want to highlight
[837.46 --> 838.76]  what many Christians say
[838.76 --> 840.32]  is the most unique feature
[840.32 --> 840.80]  of Christianity
[840.80 --> 841.66]  or one of the most
[841.66 --> 842.20]  unique features.
[842.48 --> 843.12]  You know what that is?
[843.82 --> 845.14]  That the God we worship
[845.14 --> 846.54]  is a God
[846.54 --> 847.58]  who shares suffering.
[848.70 --> 850.00]  That's a profound truth.
[850.44 --> 851.14]  The God we worship
[851.14 --> 852.12]  isn't up there
[852.12 --> 853.66]  removed from our suffering
[853.66 --> 855.08]  but came in Christ
[855.08 --> 855.70]  to share
[855.70 --> 856.96]  in some of the hardest suffering.
[856.96 --> 858.68]  that He understands
[858.68 --> 859.18]  the wounds,
[859.30 --> 859.62]  the pain,
[859.70 --> 860.08]  the suffering,
[860.18 --> 860.74]  the persecution,
[861.22 --> 861.94]  the isolation,
[862.46 --> 863.46]  all that comes
[863.46 --> 864.16]  with bearing witness
[864.16 --> 865.14]  to the rule of Christ.
[866.06 --> 867.28]  Jesus knows our suffering.
[868.90 --> 869.38]  There's a writer
[869.38 --> 869.82]  by the name of
[869.82 --> 871.42]  Nicholas Walter Storff.
[871.66 --> 872.24]  I think I've shared
[872.24 --> 872.96]  this quote before.
[873.38 --> 873.86]  He wrote a book
[873.86 --> 874.84]  called Lament for a Son
[874.84 --> 875.76]  where he lost his son
[875.76 --> 877.08]  in a tragic hiking accident.
[878.04 --> 878.76]  And he wrestles
[878.76 --> 879.48]  as a philosopher
[879.48 --> 880.56]  very existentially
[880.56 --> 881.60]  with how God
[881.60 --> 882.18]  can let something
[882.18 --> 882.88]  like this happen.
[882.88 --> 883.52]  And he says
[883.52 --> 884.50]  in this book,
[884.56 --> 884.84]  he says,
[884.90 --> 885.60]  how can you
[885.60 --> 887.56]  explain suffering?
[887.68 --> 888.16]  Why do you let
[888.16 --> 889.10]  so much pain
[889.10 --> 889.96]  happen to your world
[889.96 --> 890.60]  and to your people,
[890.68 --> 891.18]  to your children
[891.18 --> 891.84]  that you love?
[892.18 --> 892.74]  And he says,
[892.96 --> 894.12]  as we look at you,
[894.22 --> 894.60]  a new,
[894.76 --> 895.38]  more disturbing
[895.38 --> 896.30]  question arises.
[897.20 --> 898.10]  Why do you let
[898.10 --> 899.82]  yourself suffer?
[901.62 --> 902.28]  And what he's
[902.28 --> 902.86]  putting his finger
[902.86 --> 903.62]  on there is that
[903.62 --> 904.38]  God does not
[904.38 --> 905.06]  remove himself
[905.06 --> 905.70]  from suffering.
[906.52 --> 907.26]  That Jesus,
[907.46 --> 908.10]  who has come
[908.10 --> 908.84]  and who has conquered,
[909.28 --> 910.60]  knows our pain.
[910.60 --> 912.62]  And so the prayer
[912.62 --> 913.20]  that the church
[913.20 --> 914.32]  lifts up to God
[914.32 --> 914.94]  in the midst
[914.94 --> 915.60]  of persecution
[915.60 --> 917.16]  is you are sovereign
[917.16 --> 919.04]  and you share
[919.04 --> 919.94]  in our suffering.
[920.72 --> 921.32]  But the prayer
[921.32 --> 922.16]  goes beyond that.
[922.24 --> 922.90]  Look where they move
[922.90 --> 923.42]  from here.
[925.12 --> 925.66]  Now, Lord,
[925.72 --> 926.60]  this is verse 29,
[926.74 --> 927.78]  consider their threats
[927.78 --> 929.04]  and enable your servants
[929.04 --> 930.46]  to speak your word
[930.46 --> 931.88]  with great boldness.
[932.40 --> 933.34]  Stretch out your hand
[933.34 --> 933.88]  to heal
[933.88 --> 935.06]  and perform signs
[935.06 --> 935.96]  and wonders
[935.96 --> 936.70]  through the name
[936.70 --> 938.30]  of your holy servant,
[938.46 --> 938.68]  Jesus.
[939.68 --> 940.46]  What a prayer.
[941.48 --> 942.36]  Imagine you just
[942.36 --> 942.98]  got imprisoned.
[943.24 --> 944.00]  You just got threatened
[944.00 --> 944.86]  by religious leaders.
[945.02 --> 945.60]  Then you finally
[945.60 --> 946.24]  got released.
[946.78 --> 947.46]  And what's the first
[947.46 --> 947.94]  thing you pray
[947.94 --> 948.48]  with your brothers
[948.48 --> 949.48]  and sisters in the church?
[949.96 --> 950.90]  Do more wonders
[950.90 --> 953.64]  and give us boldness.
[954.44 --> 955.44]  That is powerful.
[955.56 --> 955.98]  And I want to read
[955.98 --> 956.74]  a quote for you.
[957.74 --> 958.54]  This comes from
[958.54 --> 959.42]  Justo Gonzalez.
[959.56 --> 960.36]  He's a Latin American
[960.36 --> 960.84]  scholar.
[961.34 --> 962.44]  And this is basically
[962.44 --> 963.54]  how he summarizes
[963.54 --> 964.82]  the prayer of these disciples.
[965.46 --> 966.52]  What they ask for
[966.52 --> 967.58]  is more wonders
[967.58 --> 968.46]  like the one that
[968.46 --> 969.68]  brought about the threats
[969.68 --> 970.60]  in the first place
[970.60 --> 971.60]  from the powerful.
[972.06 --> 972.76]  And they ask that
[972.76 --> 973.74]  they be given power
[973.74 --> 975.14]  to disobey the order
[975.14 --> 975.82]  of the council
[975.82 --> 977.20]  and continue preaching
[977.20 --> 978.06]  in the name of Jesus
[978.06 --> 978.94]  with boldness.
[980.10 --> 980.88]  You know what they
[980.88 --> 981.86]  didn't ask for?
[983.20 --> 984.24]  They didn't even ask
[984.24 --> 984.88]  for protection.
[985.76 --> 985.98]  You know,
[986.02 --> 986.94]  we pray that for brothers
[986.94 --> 987.90]  and sisters around the world.
[987.98 --> 988.78]  We pray that for the church
[988.78 --> 989.50]  all over.
[989.82 --> 990.44]  The disciples,
[990.62 --> 991.48]  as they're receiving
[991.48 --> 992.10]  persecution
[992.10 --> 992.96]  and they were imprisoned,
[992.96 --> 994.34]  they didn't even ask
[994.34 --> 995.02]  for protection.
[996.40 --> 997.76]  They ask for signs
[997.76 --> 998.96]  and wonders
[998.96 --> 1000.60]  and boldness.
[1001.50 --> 1002.20]  Isn't that remarkable?
[1003.56 --> 1004.50]  And here's my question
[1004.50 --> 1005.32]  for us this morning.
[1006.86 --> 1007.78]  Do our prayers
[1007.78 --> 1009.76]  look anything like this one?
[1011.26 --> 1012.46]  Do our prayers
[1012.46 --> 1013.74]  for the global church
[1013.74 --> 1015.80]  look anything like this one?
[1016.54 --> 1017.86]  Lord, consider the threats.
[1018.98 --> 1019.88]  Consider the oppression.
[1020.64 --> 1021.56]  Consider the corruption.
[1021.56 --> 1023.26]  And now, Lord,
[1023.60 --> 1024.62]  enable your servants
[1024.62 --> 1025.54]  to speak your message
[1025.54 --> 1026.16]  with boldness
[1026.16 --> 1027.66]  and stretch out your hand
[1027.66 --> 1028.88]  to perform signs
[1028.88 --> 1029.96]  and wonders
[1029.96 --> 1031.90]  through your holy servant Jesus.
[1032.14 --> 1032.38]  Amen.
[1033.84 --> 1034.90]  What might it look like
[1034.90 --> 1035.92]  for the church around the world
[1035.92 --> 1036.78]  to pray this prayer
[1036.78 --> 1037.60]  or maybe better,
[1037.72 --> 1038.40]  to put it this way,
[1038.52 --> 1039.90]  for us as Western believers
[1039.90 --> 1041.20]  to join the global church
[1041.20 --> 1042.28]  that is praying this?
[1042.88 --> 1044.06]  What might that look like?
[1046.66 --> 1048.04]  One of the basic things
[1048.04 --> 1048.82]  about this passage
[1048.82 --> 1049.66]  that I want to highlight,
[1049.76 --> 1050.30]  and I do mean
[1050.30 --> 1051.30]  this is a basic truth
[1051.30 --> 1052.64]  that's easily overlooked,
[1053.28 --> 1054.44]  is that these disciples
[1054.44 --> 1056.40]  who were with Jesus,
[1056.92 --> 1058.22]  who watched Jesus,
[1058.74 --> 1059.46]  who were there
[1059.46 --> 1060.50]  when Jesus ascended
[1060.50 --> 1061.46]  to be with the Father,
[1062.18 --> 1063.20]  they saw themselves
[1063.20 --> 1064.72]  as deeply responsible
[1064.72 --> 1066.04]  for sharing the gospel.
[1066.88 --> 1067.58]  And I say that
[1067.58 --> 1068.56]  because in this prayer,
[1068.70 --> 1069.38]  you see that there's
[1069.38 --> 1070.28]  a huge emphasis
[1070.28 --> 1071.76]  on the sovereignty of God,
[1072.08 --> 1073.22]  a sense that He's in control,
[1073.48 --> 1074.64]  He's growing His church,
[1074.86 --> 1076.64]  He's moving in the world.
[1077.30 --> 1078.48]  And yet that not for a second
[1078.48 --> 1079.70]  took away from their sense of,
[1079.70 --> 1080.80]  I am called,
[1080.96 --> 1082.08]  we as the church are called,
[1082.26 --> 1083.48]  to bear witness to Christ
[1083.48 --> 1084.60]  and that it's actually God
[1084.60 --> 1085.96]  by Jesus through the Spirit
[1085.96 --> 1087.34]  in the church
[1087.34 --> 1088.44]  that makes known
[1088.44 --> 1089.36]  the good news of Jesus.
[1089.78 --> 1090.64]  That's an important truth.
[1090.68 --> 1091.26]  They saw themselves
[1091.26 --> 1091.98]  as responsible.
[1093.48 --> 1094.50]  And I wonder if we share
[1094.50 --> 1095.58]  that sense of responsibility
[1095.58 --> 1096.30]  here today.
[1098.52 --> 1099.42]  A number of years ago,
[1099.46 --> 1100.04]  I wrote a paper
[1100.04 --> 1100.78]  on a man by the name
[1100.78 --> 1101.58]  of William Carey.
[1101.66 --> 1102.16]  Does anyone know
[1102.16 --> 1103.26]  who William Carey is?
[1103.96 --> 1104.64]  A few people.
[1105.08 --> 1105.98]  Misha, she knows
[1105.98 --> 1106.74]  who William Carey is.
[1106.74 --> 1107.28]  She's going to come up
[1107.28 --> 1107.90]  and tell you the story.
[1108.94 --> 1109.62]  William Carey,
[1109.68 --> 1110.34]  he grew up
[1110.34 --> 1112.06]  in the late 18th century,
[1112.14 --> 1112.98]  early 19th century,
[1112.98 --> 1113.50]  and he's known
[1113.50 --> 1114.14]  as the father
[1114.14 --> 1114.94]  of modern missions.
[1115.28 --> 1116.58]  I don't quite like that title
[1116.58 --> 1117.54]  for a lot of reasons,
[1117.98 --> 1119.14]  but he grew up in Christendom.
[1119.30 --> 1119.88]  In Christendom,
[1119.96 --> 1120.34]  in England,
[1120.42 --> 1121.34]  where he lived at the time,
[1121.38 --> 1121.94]  was this notion
[1121.94 --> 1123.30]  that everyone in your country
[1123.30 --> 1124.42]  is a believer.
[1124.96 --> 1126.22]  So there's no real sense
[1126.22 --> 1126.94]  of evangelism,
[1127.02 --> 1127.70]  there's no real sense
[1127.70 --> 1128.06]  of mission,
[1128.06 --> 1129.08]  because you're all
[1129.08 --> 1129.76]  on the same team,
[1129.82 --> 1130.34]  so to speak.
[1131.66 --> 1132.60]  William Carey, though,
[1132.72 --> 1133.56]  and I do believe
[1133.56 --> 1134.10]  this is a work
[1134.10 --> 1134.50]  of the Spirit,
[1134.56 --> 1135.48]  had a deep desire
[1135.48 --> 1136.88]  to bring the gospel
[1136.88 --> 1137.66]  to places where
[1137.66 --> 1139.02]  it has not yet been heard.
[1139.48 --> 1140.08]  He had a sense
[1140.08 --> 1141.04]  as he looked out his window
[1141.04 --> 1142.28]  that there's a huge
[1142.28 --> 1143.28]  horizon in this world
[1143.28 --> 1143.92]  and many people
[1143.92 --> 1144.58]  who had not heard
[1144.58 --> 1145.20]  about Jesus,
[1145.64 --> 1146.54]  and he felt compelled
[1146.54 --> 1147.44]  to share the gospel
[1147.44 --> 1148.46]  with those who hadn't heard it.
[1149.30 --> 1150.68]  And there's a fairly famous story
[1150.68 --> 1151.92]  of him as a young pastor
[1151.92 --> 1152.52]  in his 20s
[1152.52 --> 1153.94]  going to a synod gathering,
[1153.98 --> 1154.84]  and a synod gathering
[1154.84 --> 1156.74]  is where all the church leaders
[1156.74 --> 1158.44]  and pastors of that denomination
[1158.44 --> 1159.00]  meet together.
[1159.10 --> 1159.96]  It's a big gathering.
[1160.76 --> 1161.62]  And he stands up
[1161.62 --> 1162.50]  in the middle of this gathering
[1162.50 --> 1163.12]  and he says,
[1163.12 --> 1166.00]  is not God sending us
[1166.00 --> 1167.46]  to share the gospel
[1167.46 --> 1168.66]  with those who haven't heard it?
[1169.46 --> 1170.56]  And the chairman
[1170.56 --> 1171.42]  of this meeting,
[1171.82 --> 1173.38]  a very prominent pastor
[1173.38 --> 1174.62]  and leader in that denomination,
[1174.76 --> 1175.86]  he looked at William Carey
[1175.86 --> 1176.28]  and he said,
[1176.58 --> 1178.02]  sit down, young man.
[1178.28 --> 1180.60]  If God wants to convert people
[1180.60 --> 1181.88]  to Jesus,
[1182.14 --> 1183.74]  he'll do it without your help
[1183.74 --> 1185.20]  and he'll do it without mine.
[1186.88 --> 1187.84]  And William Carey
[1187.84 --> 1188.72]  was humiliated
[1188.72 --> 1190.06]  in front of this major group
[1190.06 --> 1191.88]  of significant pastors.
[1193.12 --> 1195.12]  Now you can hear that story
[1195.12 --> 1195.50]  and say,
[1195.64 --> 1195.92]  wow,
[1196.08 --> 1198.18]  that church had lost its way.
[1198.66 --> 1198.90]  They were,
[1198.98 --> 1199.16]  you know,
[1199.22 --> 1200.80]  how can a leader of the church
[1200.80 --> 1200.98]  say,
[1201.08 --> 1201.82]  sit down, young man,
[1201.88 --> 1202.66]  we're not supposed to share
[1202.66 --> 1203.10]  the gospel.
[1203.66 --> 1204.40]  God is sovereign.
[1205.40 --> 1206.46]  But I wonder
[1206.46 --> 1208.34]  if we're honest with ourselves,
[1208.34 --> 1210.30]  we're actually more in line
[1210.30 --> 1211.20]  with that synod
[1211.20 --> 1212.86]  than maybe William Carey.
[1213.28 --> 1214.68]  That there's a sense in which
[1214.68 --> 1216.82]  we want God to grow the church,
[1216.88 --> 1218.20]  we want the spirit to move,
[1218.20 --> 1220.20]  but we don't feel responsible
[1220.20 --> 1220.76]  for that.
[1221.28 --> 1222.16]  We don't see ourselves
[1222.16 --> 1223.42]  as taken up by the spirit
[1223.42 --> 1224.68]  into that responsibility
[1224.68 --> 1225.72]  and that the spirit
[1225.72 --> 1226.84]  will work through us
[1226.84 --> 1228.60]  in our ordinary words
[1228.60 --> 1229.92]  and our ordinary deeds
[1229.92 --> 1230.76]  to make the kingdom
[1230.76 --> 1231.58]  of Jesus known.
[1232.74 --> 1233.26]  Or,
[1233.50 --> 1234.48]  we might think,
[1234.72 --> 1235.70]  I'm so glad
[1235.70 --> 1236.66]  that God is calling
[1236.66 --> 1237.40]  other people
[1237.40 --> 1238.54]  like Dylan and Hannah
[1238.54 --> 1239.12]  and Grace
[1239.12 --> 1240.26]  and Sophia and Barnabas
[1240.26 --> 1241.62]  and they're sharing the gospel
[1241.62 --> 1243.16]  and we're off the hook.
[1243.16 --> 1245.62]  Is that something
[1245.62 --> 1246.50]  you've ever felt before?
[1248.00 --> 1248.52]  Neglecting
[1248.52 --> 1250.02]  the reality
[1250.02 --> 1251.66]  that every single believer
[1251.66 --> 1253.38]  is sent.
[1254.60 --> 1255.58]  Every church
[1255.58 --> 1256.56]  in every city,
[1256.88 --> 1258.22]  including Hope Community Church
[1258.22 --> 1258.82]  in Surrey,
[1259.30 --> 1260.96]  is a missionary church.
[1262.00 --> 1262.42]  And perhaps
[1262.42 --> 1263.34]  what's needed most
[1263.34 --> 1264.44]  in churches like ours
[1264.44 --> 1264.94]  in the West
[1264.94 --> 1265.72]  is a recovery
[1265.72 --> 1266.66]  of that posture
[1266.66 --> 1268.32]  of a missionary.
[1269.32 --> 1269.52]  In fact,
[1269.54 --> 1270.12]  we have a posture
[1270.12 --> 1270.86]  in our own culture
[1270.86 --> 1271.70]  that we are sent
[1271.70 --> 1273.30]  as the words
[1273.30 --> 1274.18]  and the deeds
[1274.18 --> 1274.92]  of the church
[1274.92 --> 1275.84]  to bear witness
[1275.84 --> 1276.32]  to Jesus
[1276.32 --> 1277.62]  as the rightful ruler
[1277.62 --> 1278.46]  of all things.
[1280.32 --> 1281.08]  We're sent.
[1284.24 --> 1285.22]  My favorite part
[1285.22 --> 1285.72]  of this passage
[1285.72 --> 1286.24]  is probably
[1286.24 --> 1286.96]  how it finishes.
[1288.54 --> 1289.12]  And if you look
[1289.12 --> 1290.20]  at verse 31
[1290.20 --> 1290.88]  after they pray
[1290.88 --> 1291.60]  for boldness,
[1291.96 --> 1292.50]  after they pray
[1292.50 --> 1292.96]  for Jesus
[1292.96 --> 1293.80]  to work wonders
[1293.80 --> 1294.38]  and miracles,
[1294.58 --> 1294.98]  which I think
[1294.98 --> 1295.90]  we also need to pray
[1295.90 --> 1296.60]  in our own day,
[1297.20 --> 1297.88]  the prayer finishes
[1297.88 --> 1298.44]  this way,
[1298.76 --> 1299.00]  or sorry,
[1299.12 --> 1300.06]  the passage finishes
[1300.06 --> 1300.44]  this way,
[1300.50 --> 1300.78]  31.
[1300.78 --> 1301.80]  After they prayed,
[1301.86 --> 1302.32]  the place
[1302.32 --> 1303.12]  where they were meeting
[1303.12 --> 1304.48]  was shaken.
[1305.38 --> 1307.14]  And they were filled
[1307.14 --> 1308.46]  with the Holy Spirit.
[1308.88 --> 1310.20]  And they did speak
[1310.20 --> 1312.38]  the word of God boldly.
[1312.52 --> 1313.26]  And I want to add
[1313.26 --> 1314.06]  that they didn't just speak
[1314.06 --> 1314.86]  the word of God boldly.
[1314.90 --> 1315.52]  You know what we see
[1315.52 --> 1316.42]  in the next very verse?
[1317.40 --> 1318.22]  We see that they're
[1318.22 --> 1318.86]  of one heart
[1318.86 --> 1319.68]  and one mind
[1319.68 --> 1321.10]  and they're radically generous.
[1321.26 --> 1321.74]  No one claimed
[1321.74 --> 1322.76]  possessions of their own.
[1322.86 --> 1323.98]  They shared generously
[1323.98 --> 1324.74]  so they could care
[1324.74 --> 1325.28]  for the poor,
[1325.78 --> 1326.62]  care for the marginalized,
[1326.98 --> 1328.80]  and live as a radical statement
[1328.80 --> 1329.48]  of what happens
[1329.48 --> 1330.02]  with the kingdom.
[1330.78 --> 1331.30]  And what happens
[1331.30 --> 1332.10]  when Jesus comes.
[1332.58 --> 1333.82]  They were bold
[1333.82 --> 1335.14]  in their words
[1335.14 --> 1335.54]  and their deeds
[1335.54 --> 1336.20]  and they were filled
[1336.20 --> 1337.00]  with the Holy Spirit.
[1337.40 --> 1338.62]  God answered this prayer
[1338.62 --> 1339.30]  right there
[1339.30 --> 1340.12]  and right then.
[1340.46 --> 1341.06]  And I have to say,
[1341.20 --> 1341.50]  church,
[1342.28 --> 1342.96]  I would love
[1342.96 --> 1343.84]  for that to be us.
[1344.52 --> 1345.76]  I want us to be praying
[1345.76 --> 1346.88]  that we would be filled
[1346.88 --> 1347.68]  with the Holy Spirit
[1347.68 --> 1348.36]  in our city.
[1348.74 --> 1349.54]  That we'd be able
[1349.54 --> 1350.40]  to meet the needs
[1350.40 --> 1350.96]  and challenges
[1350.96 --> 1351.60]  and the demands
[1351.60 --> 1352.26]  of being the church
[1352.26 --> 1352.90]  here in the West
[1352.90 --> 1353.66]  the same way
[1353.66 --> 1354.86]  our brothers and sisters are
[1354.86 --> 1356.08]  in Somalia,
[1356.90 --> 1357.34]  Nigeria,
[1357.34 --> 1358.64]  in Beirut
[1358.64 --> 1360.16]  and all over.
[1361.06 --> 1362.10]  That we would be filled
[1362.10 --> 1362.68]  with the Spirit.
[1363.56 --> 1364.72]  And my prayer for us
[1364.72 --> 1366.82]  as I bring this sermon
[1366.82 --> 1367.52]  to a close
[1367.52 --> 1370.38]  is that we would have
[1370.38 --> 1371.72]  the reconciling power
[1371.72 --> 1372.62]  here in our city.
[1373.54 --> 1374.60]  That people would see
[1374.60 --> 1375.58]  in our ordinary lives
[1375.58 --> 1376.76]  the resurrection life
[1376.76 --> 1377.48]  of Jesus.
[1378.42 --> 1380.26]  That we would bear witness
[1380.26 --> 1381.26]  to His love,
[1381.88 --> 1382.64]  His grace,
[1383.14 --> 1384.08]  His power,
[1384.64 --> 1385.48]  His healing.
[1386.28 --> 1387.32]  And that we would do
[1387.32 --> 1388.20]  what we've been called
[1388.20 --> 1389.10]  to do as part of
[1389.10 --> 1391.10]  this huge global church.
[1392.78 --> 1394.32]  And so I pray this morning
[1394.32 --> 1395.02]  that the gospel
[1395.02 --> 1396.02]  would go out in Mongolia,
[1397.28 --> 1398.02]  North Africa,
[1398.86 --> 1399.30]  Malaysia,
[1399.58 --> 1399.96]  Korea,
[1400.20 --> 1400.64]  Nigeria,
[1401.10 --> 1401.46]  Canada
[1401.46 --> 1402.88]  and the ends
[1402.88 --> 1403.60]  of the earth.
[1404.08 --> 1405.44]  That signs and wonders
[1405.44 --> 1406.90]  would take place
[1406.90 --> 1407.88]  in the name of Jesus
[1407.88 --> 1408.54]  here too.
[1408.54 --> 1411.38]  For the last week
[1411.38 --> 1412.46]  I just learned this morning
[1412.46 --> 1413.20]  there's churches
[1413.20 --> 1414.24]  all over the world
[1414.24 --> 1414.94]  that have been praying
[1414.94 --> 1415.74]  the Lord's Prayer.
[1416.26 --> 1417.20]  Praying for the kingdom
[1417.20 --> 1417.76]  to come
[1417.76 --> 1418.90]  as a Pentecost prayer.
[1419.74 --> 1420.26]  And what we're going
[1420.26 --> 1421.14]  to hear now
[1421.14 --> 1422.66]  is actually a prayer
[1422.66 --> 1423.34]  that's put together
[1423.34 --> 1423.86]  by the churches
[1423.86 --> 1424.54]  of Cloverdale
[1424.54 --> 1425.98]  that the Spirit of God
[1425.98 --> 1426.96]  would move in our city.
[1427.54 --> 1428.18]  And at the end
[1428.18 --> 1428.66]  of this prayer
[1428.66 --> 1429.02]  we're going to have
[1429.02 --> 1430.22]  to just listen for it.
[1430.56 --> 1431.14]  It ends with
[1431.14 --> 1431.90]  the Lord's Prayer
[1431.90 --> 1432.72]  and it ends with
[1432.72 --> 1433.34]  the version where
[1433.34 --> 1434.40]  we say trespasses.
[1434.48 --> 1435.20]  That might be helpful
[1435.20 --> 1436.52]  in advance for some people.
[1436.94 --> 1438.16]  And I encourage us
[1438.16 --> 1438.94]  when you hear
[1438.94 --> 1439.64]  the Lord's Prayer
[1439.64 --> 1440.32]  being prayed
[1440.32 --> 1441.48]  join in
[1441.48 --> 1442.22]  and we will join
[1442.22 --> 1443.04]  the global church
[1443.04 --> 1443.50]  in praying
[1443.50 --> 1444.50]  that the kingdom of God
[1444.50 --> 1445.42]  would come in our city
[1445.42 --> 1446.54]  in this time
[1446.54 --> 1447.88]  on this Pentecost Sunday.
[1448.00 --> 1448.56]  Does that sound good?
[1449.20 --> 1449.46]  Alright.
[1449.60 --> 1450.68]  So be led in the prayer
[1450.68 --> 1451.46]  and then at the end
[1451.46 --> 1452.62]  we'll all pray together
[1452.62 --> 1453.42]  and then we'll sing
[1453.42 --> 1454.38]  a song of response.
[1454.38 --> 1463.88]  Come Holy Spirit
[1463.88 --> 1466.16]  and fill us with your love.
[1467.30 --> 1468.48]  Open our eyes
[1468.48 --> 1469.64]  to see the presence
[1469.64 --> 1471.30]  of God all around us
[1471.30 --> 1473.02]  in the stillness
[1473.02 --> 1474.54]  of this sacred space
[1474.54 --> 1476.26]  in the busyness
[1476.26 --> 1476.92]  and noise
[1476.92 --> 1478.08]  of our city streets
[1478.08 --> 1479.86]  and the joys
[1479.86 --> 1480.76]  and celebrations
[1480.76 --> 1481.88]  of our lives
[1481.88 --> 1483.56]  and in the tragedies
[1483.56 --> 1484.32]  and struggles
[1484.32 --> 1486.02]  that break our hearts.
[1486.74 --> 1487.78]  Come Holy Spirit
[1487.78 --> 1489.10]  and comfort those
[1489.10 --> 1489.76]  who grieve.
[1491.12 --> 1492.04]  Grant them the peace
[1492.04 --> 1493.38]  that only you can bring.
[1494.52 --> 1495.32]  Stir within us
[1495.32 --> 1496.08]  a trust
[1496.08 --> 1498.02]  in life beyond death
[1498.02 --> 1499.54]  as we ponder
[1499.54 --> 1500.20]  the mystery
[1500.20 --> 1501.86]  of Christ's resurrection
[1501.86 --> 1503.80]  and the hope we have
[1503.80 --> 1504.36]  in a new
[1504.36 --> 1505.84]  and everlasting life.
[1505.84 --> 1507.60]  Come Holy Spirit
[1507.60 --> 1508.66]  and bring wholeness
[1508.66 --> 1509.32]  to the sick.
[1511.08 --> 1512.08]  Strengthen those
[1512.08 --> 1512.72]  who are weak.
[1513.86 --> 1514.60]  Heal the wounded
[1514.60 --> 1515.20]  and broken.
[1516.34 --> 1517.04]  Give rest
[1517.04 --> 1517.70]  to the weary.
[1518.32 --> 1519.08]  Come Holy Spirit
[1519.08 --> 1521.62]  and inspire
[1521.62 --> 1523.16]  our warring world
[1523.16 --> 1524.28]  to seek peace.
[1526.12 --> 1527.44]  To love our enemies.
[1528.26 --> 1529.40]  To put away
[1529.40 --> 1530.04]  our weapons.
[1531.18 --> 1532.26]  To remember
[1532.26 --> 1533.46]  the price paid
[1533.46 --> 1534.50]  for our freedom
[1534.50 --> 1536.18]  and to care
[1536.18 --> 1537.22]  for those
[1537.22 --> 1538.20]  who have served.
[1539.02 --> 1540.26]  Come Holy Spirit
[1540.26 --> 1541.88]  ignite a fire
[1541.88 --> 1542.66]  in our bones
[1542.66 --> 1543.58]  a passion
[1543.58 --> 1544.38]  for justice
[1544.38 --> 1545.90]  that cannot be quenched
[1545.90 --> 1547.10]  until all
[1547.10 --> 1548.18]  of the Father's
[1548.18 --> 1549.32]  children are loved.
[1549.32 --> 1550.72]  Until no one
[1550.72 --> 1551.40]  is marginalized
[1551.40 --> 1552.22]  or oppressed.
[1552.64 --> 1553.66]  Until everyone
[1553.66 --> 1554.62]  has the opportunity
[1554.62 --> 1556.02]  to thrive.
[1556.42 --> 1557.28]  Until the world
[1557.28 --> 1558.52]  is transformed
[1558.52 --> 1559.68]  and renewed.
[1560.36 --> 1562.38]  Come Holy Spirit
[1562.38 --> 1564.00]  and revive
[1564.00 --> 1565.40]  your church.
[1566.60 --> 1567.40]  Liberate us
[1567.40 --> 1569.14]  from complacency
[1569.14 --> 1570.38]  and apathy.
[1571.60 --> 1572.42]  Inspire us
[1572.42 --> 1573.72]  with Christ's vision
[1573.72 --> 1575.20]  for a world
[1575.20 --> 1575.84]  reborn.
[1576.60 --> 1577.60]  Help us to recognize
[1577.60 --> 1578.40]  our gifts
[1578.40 --> 1579.30]  for ministry
[1579.30 --> 1581.48]  and to use them
[1581.48 --> 1582.22]  in service
[1582.22 --> 1583.00]  of others.
[1583.84 --> 1585.28]  Transform our hearts
[1585.28 --> 1586.26]  and our minds.
[1587.14 --> 1588.04]  Fill us with love
[1588.04 --> 1588.96]  that overflows.
[1588.96 --> 1590.36]  remind us
[1590.36 --> 1590.90]  that there is
[1590.90 --> 1592.92]  no greater calling
[1592.92 --> 1594.30]  than to love you
[1594.30 --> 1595.88]  with all that we are
[1595.88 --> 1597.62]  and to love our neighbors
[1597.62 --> 1598.86]  as ourselves.
[1599.24 --> 1600.24]  Gracious God
[1600.24 --> 1602.92]  give us a glimpse
[1602.92 --> 1604.10]  of your kingdom
[1604.10 --> 1606.74]  emerging around us
[1606.74 --> 1607.74]  and drawing us
[1607.74 --> 1609.32]  into the new things
[1609.32 --> 1610.70]  that you are doing
[1610.70 --> 1611.54]  in this world.
[1612.02 --> 1613.38]  It is for your kingdom
[1613.38 --> 1615.04]  that we now pray
[1615.04 --> 1616.68]  filled with your spirit
[1616.68 --> 1618.94]  using the words
[1618.94 --> 1620.32]  Jesus taught us.
[1621.32 --> 1622.30]  Our Father
[1622.30 --> 1623.16]  who is in heaven
[1623.16 --> 1624.40]  hallowed be
[1624.40 --> 1625.18]  your name
[1625.18 --> 1627.06]  your kingdom come
[1627.06 --> 1628.52]  your will be done
[1628.52 --> 1629.48]  on earth
[1629.48 --> 1630.54]  as it is
[1630.54 --> 1631.06]  in heaven.
[1631.50 --> 1632.80]  Give us this day
[1632.80 --> 1634.08]  our daily bread
[1634.08 --> 1636.06]  and forgive us
[1636.06 --> 1637.34]  our trespasses
[1637.34 --> 1639.24]  as we forgive those
[1639.24 --> 1640.12]  who trespass
[1640.12 --> 1640.96]  against us
[1640.96 --> 1642.22]  and lead us not
[1642.22 --> 1643.00]  into temptation
[1643.00 --> 1644.80]  but deliver us
[1644.80 --> 1645.38]  from evil.
[1645.38 --> 1646.92]  for yours
[1646.92 --> 1647.64]  is the kingdom
[1647.64 --> 1649.46]  yours is the power
[1649.46 --> 1650.44]  forever
[1650.44 --> 1651.68]  and ever
[1651.68 --> 1652.70]  forever
[1652.70 --> 1653.66]  and ever
[1653.66 --> 1654.26]  forever
[1654.26 --> 1655.48]  and ever
[1655.48 --> 1656.04]  forever
[1656.04 --> 1656.80]  Amen.
