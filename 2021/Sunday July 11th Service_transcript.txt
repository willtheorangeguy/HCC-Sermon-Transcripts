[0.00 --> 29.98]  We'll be right back.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  We'll be right back.
[60.00 --> 66.52]  Oh, big hand for Dave.
[73.80 --> 74.78]  Oh, geez.
[75.44 --> 76.42]  There's so many of you.
[76.42 --> 80.32]  Oh, wow.
[80.52 --> 83.02]  I'm just going to take a moment, please, if you allow me.
[83.88 --> 84.28]  Wow.
[84.98 --> 86.42]  I'm going to try not to cry.
[86.84 --> 89.62]  I cried during dwell, so my tears are all gone for now.
[90.12 --> 91.66]  But this is awesome.
[92.06 --> 98.58]  And isn't it so beautifully uncomfortable right now, being so close to people that you're not used to, outside your social bubble?
[98.58 --> 104.80]  So, and I think it's part of that life where we're trained.
[105.20 --> 106.50]  It's going to be uncomfortable.
[107.26 --> 110.88]  And that's how it is, because we're very self-centered beings.
[111.74 --> 113.82]  But I think this is how God shapes us.
[113.94 --> 122.88]  One way is just this simple thing where you have to sit beside people that are not part of your social bubble or your family.
[123.58 --> 125.16]  And so, welcome.
[125.54 --> 128.48]  And it's great to see many new faces for me.
[128.48 --> 130.60]  I feel kind of like a celebrity.
[130.80 --> 132.14]  You guys are like, oh, hey, Jonathan.
[132.78 --> 133.44]  Yeah, I know you.
[133.50 --> 134.44]  I've seen you on TV.
[134.66 --> 136.72]  I'm like, oh, thank you.
[136.80 --> 137.90]  I don't know you, though.
[138.96 --> 144.70]  And I hope to get to know you as we get closer and closer to, yeah, past this pandemic.
[145.46 --> 147.34]  And so, welcome again.
[148.04 --> 150.82]  Today, we are still in the Exodus series.
[151.20 --> 153.58]  And we want to begin with a quick review.
[153.58 --> 162.68]  Because we are doing a series, and it helps me, maybe more than it helps you, to go through where we are exactly in this series as we look at the Exodus.
[163.64 --> 169.68]  A reminder that Exodus is part of a larger story that's split up into three parts.
[169.80 --> 176.08]  And Dave did a great job explaining for us the three parts, which is God liberating through His saving works.
[176.46 --> 179.88]  And then God binding with His people through a covenant.
[179.88 --> 185.12]  And then God in His loving grace coming and dwelling with His people.
[185.68 --> 188.08]  And He's dwelling with us here today as well.
[188.52 --> 191.36]  And so, we see that those big three parts.
[191.98 --> 196.04]  Liberation, covenant binding, and God dwelling.
[196.20 --> 197.70]  Emmanuel, God with us.
[198.34 --> 205.88]  And so, today, we're still in the first part, where we look at God liberating His people Israel from slavery in Egypt.
[205.88 --> 211.26]  While in Egypt, some of the key questions that Israel had were,
[212.26 --> 216.10]  Where is the God of their ancestor Abraham?
[217.46 --> 220.14]  And where is that covenant promise?
[220.66 --> 223.06]  The blessed to be a blessing for the whole world.
[223.44 --> 224.74]  Where is that promise coming into?
[225.62 --> 230.88]  Now, is God able to fulfill that promise He made to their ancestor Abraham?
[230.88 --> 235.98]  Is He even able to fulfill that promise?
[236.42 --> 240.10]  And those are the big questions that Israel had during this time.
[240.46 --> 244.66]  And remember from last week, even our great Moses, our famous Moses,
[245.14 --> 249.04]  was left doubting and cowering from confronting Pharaoh
[249.04 --> 253.24]  because he did not fully trust God to be the true hero.
[253.24 --> 262.44]  And Dave talked about how Moses and us ourselves reflecting how we think we ourselves are the heroes of God's story
[262.44 --> 265.28]  when God is the true hero.
[266.50 --> 271.20]  And so, today, we look at how God does actually answer that question.
[272.00 --> 272.68]  Are you able?
[273.06 --> 274.52]  Are you going to fulfill your promise?
[275.84 --> 276.92]  What's the answer?
[276.92 --> 281.86]  And I'm copying what Dave did last week.
[281.92 --> 282.88]  You're allowed to say, right?
[283.02 --> 283.82]  You're allowed to talk.
[284.06 --> 288.28]  I'm not used to a congregation where the congregation is allowed to talk during the pastor's sermon.
[289.12 --> 290.16]  But what's the answer here?
[290.72 --> 292.58]  God is saying, thank you, Lockie.
[293.10 --> 294.82]  Yes, I am able.
[295.32 --> 296.74]  I am your God.
[296.74 --> 300.58]  And I am fully capable of freeing you from slavery,
[301.12 --> 304.22]  from religious bondage, which we're going to look at today.
[304.22 --> 310.20]  And so, let's pause for a minute and think about what freedom from slavery actually means here.
[310.52 --> 315.90]  And here, in this part especially, I'm going to lean heavily on Dr. Goin, without his permission, I might add.
[316.40 --> 318.22]  And so, I'm even using his slides today.
[319.18 --> 320.16]  I didn't ask permission.
[320.30 --> 320.78]  Sorry, Mike.
[321.48 --> 329.94]  You see, in order to detoxicate Israel from the paganism, the worldliness that plagued them,
[329.94 --> 335.28]  then God puts on a display of his justice and power through plagues on Egypt.
[336.08 --> 337.52]  See what I did there with the plagues?
[337.96 --> 339.52]  I thought I was clever when I did this.
[340.26 --> 348.40]  So, the paganism, the worldliness that plagued Israel was overthrown by God's plagues on Egypt.
[349.22 --> 353.98]  And it's not just God showing his power just so that he can show that, hey, I'm powerful.
[353.98 --> 361.52]  It is an act of love, justice, and mercy, especially for his people and all those that we're witnessing.
[362.88 --> 367.34]  And so, through Moses, God is trying to give his people a new story.
[367.76 --> 376.20]  And I would further add God's originally intended story through Abraham to shape their communal lives as God's people.
[377.76 --> 380.42]  Why does this matter to us today?
[380.42 --> 388.34]  Well, because we should realize that this story is the same story that we identify with.
[390.12 --> 397.40]  In Christ's work, he detoxifies us from the plague of sin.
[397.40 --> 406.16]  And so, the actual plagues in Exodus and the actual freedom that they have from slavery from Egypt was a release from,
[406.28 --> 411.10]  and I want you to remember this key concept today, religious bondage.
[411.72 --> 416.72]  A freedom, a breaking of this religious bondage.
[416.72 --> 428.28]  Today, our society tries to define religion as if it can be set apart from our personal and private lives to the public and social life.
[428.80 --> 435.34]  In the ancient Near Eastern context of our Bible and the true biblical definition of what a religion is,
[435.82 --> 438.68]  it incorporates all aspects of life.
[438.68 --> 444.46]  Whether it be social, private, spiritual, economic, political, you name it.
[445.12 --> 447.18]  Religion incorporates everything.
[447.36 --> 449.16]  It is our being.
[450.24 --> 453.32]  Like it says in the Shema verse, Deuteronomy 6.4,
[453.92 --> 458.08]  Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.
[458.32 --> 465.18]  It's not just when you go home, when you feel a little emotional, or when you're a little down, pray to God.
[465.18 --> 468.44]  But then when you're at your workplace, that doesn't matter.
[468.72 --> 470.02]  Don't bring your religion to school.
[470.52 --> 472.90]  Don't bring your religion to society, to your workplace.
[473.12 --> 476.56]  That's not allowed because you can separate those, right?
[478.36 --> 480.92]  And today, God is saying, no, you can't.
[481.42 --> 486.60]  I'm going to give you total freedom from that religious bondage that you have to Pharaoh.
[486.82 --> 487.82]  We're talking about Israel.
[487.82 --> 495.16]  And so if you have your Bibles, if you have your phones, please turn with me to Exodus 7.
[495.88 --> 498.04]  We're going to be looking at two different verses.
[498.28 --> 501.34]  We're going to be looking at many verses in general throughout the plagues.
[501.82 --> 507.86]  But let's look at and read Exodus 7, verse 2 to 5 first.
[507.86 --> 537.84]  And it says,
[537.86 --> 550.94]  And then, verse 16 in the same chapter.
[550.94 --> 560.64]  And it's the famous line,
[560.64 --> 575.70]  And I suggest that these verses that we just read outline the main purpose behind the whole Exodus event.
[577.16 --> 580.52]  Generally speaking, we can find a dual purpose.
[580.84 --> 584.42]  And this dual purpose is explicitly mentioned throughout the plagues.
[584.42 --> 587.14]  So the question is,
[587.14 --> 589.98]  Why is God freeing His people from slavery?
[590.54 --> 592.60]  I.e. religious bondage.
[593.28 --> 595.46]  Why are you trying to break that bondage, God?
[596.66 --> 599.92]  Well, the two main purposes here is that,
[600.30 --> 608.28]  First, so that Israel, Egypt, and all who witness the plagues and the Exodus event may know that Yahweh,
[608.28 --> 612.50]  The God of Israel is the true God of all creation.
[613.24 --> 614.30]  That's the first purpose.
[614.70 --> 615.90]  The second one is that,
[616.20 --> 619.32]  In order for God's firstborn son, Israel,
[620.08 --> 622.52]  To worship their true God,
[623.02 --> 624.22]  Whom they call Father.
[625.98 --> 628.60]  And so as we briefly go over the ten plagues today,
[629.10 --> 630.88]  Which hopefully is familiar to you somewhat,
[630.88 --> 639.60]  We get to witness ourselves how God is breaking every little chain that was bonding Israel to Egypt in religious bondage.
[641.08 --> 641.44]  And so,
[642.50 --> 643.76]  Mike, thank you for your permission.
[644.62 --> 645.38]  I have,
[645.66 --> 646.82]  Well, it's not slides,
[646.94 --> 649.04]  But it's going to be listed up here.
[649.12 --> 651.46]  We're just going to go through each one really quickly.
[651.60 --> 653.22]  So the blood plague is the first one.
[653.60 --> 658.54]  And it addresses an Egyptian deity by the name of Hepi,
[658.54 --> 659.26]  Or Hapi.
[659.26 --> 660.10]  And he,
[660.92 --> 662.64]  Well, I don't know the gender of this god either.
[663.24 --> 663.96]  Oh, goddess.
[664.22 --> 664.70]  It's right there.
[664.98 --> 666.16]  The goddess of the Nile.
[666.48 --> 675.22]  And so you remember how God told Moses to turn the Nile into a river of blood.
[676.14 --> 677.06]  And then the next one,
[678.12 --> 682.94]  You have this hecht, frog and fertility goddess.
[683.50 --> 684.30]  And then the next one,
[685.94 --> 686.36]  Jen,
[687.06 --> 688.70]  God of earth coming up from the dust.
[688.70 --> 689.34]  Next one,
[691.02 --> 691.82]  The fly.
[691.94 --> 694.86]  The plague of the flies was to address the god of Kepri,
[695.18 --> 697.66]  Fly face god representing the renewal of life.
[697.96 --> 698.76]  And then the next one,
[700.32 --> 700.80]  Hathar.
[701.04 --> 701.62]  Next one,
[703.36 --> 703.88]  Isis.
[704.16 --> 706.60]  And this was a moon goddess that gave healing.
[707.14 --> 709.94]  And then you have the plague of hell that was addressing Nut,
[710.52 --> 711.46]  Newt, I should say.
[711.66 --> 713.24]  The sky goddess, bringer of rain.
[713.24 --> 713.92]  And then,
[715.56 --> 716.28]  Locus.
[716.48 --> 716.88]  Seth.
[717.30 --> 717.56]  Set.
[717.94 --> 719.84]  God of the desert storms and chaos.
[720.32 --> 720.58]  Next.
[722.26 --> 723.18]  Plague of darkness.
[723.40 --> 723.70]  Raw.
[724.30 --> 726.42]  Obviously, that's the famous Egyptian god.
[726.66 --> 727.44]  The sun god.
[727.44 --> 728.44]  God brings darkness.
[728.44 --> 729.32]  God brings darkness.
[729.64 --> 730.72]  Utter darkness.
[731.12 --> 733.04]  Only in the area of Egypt.
[733.44 --> 736.22]  Where the area where the Israelites were living,
[736.94 --> 739.56]  They weren't plagued by darkness.
[739.92 --> 740.76]  God was showing,
[741.42 --> 746.16]  I am more powerful than the Egyptian gods that you guys have.
[746.82 --> 749.06]  And I'm going to break every single one of those.
[749.80 --> 750.86]  And these ten plagues,
[751.30 --> 751.94]  in detail,
[752.10 --> 754.66]  show us that bondage breaking.
[757.60 --> 758.80]  The last one.
[760.00 --> 762.02]  The plague of taking the firstborn.
[763.06 --> 764.60]  And this is a judgment on Pharaoh,
[764.70 --> 767.58]  who is considered the image of Raw,
[767.58 --> 768.90]  or the image of the gods,
[769.00 --> 770.04]  representing the gods,
[770.20 --> 771.16]  or later on,
[771.22 --> 772.78]  the pharaohs just call themselves gods.
[773.92 --> 774.98]  And how they,
[775.18 --> 777.36]  the firstborn of the gods in Egypt,
[777.50 --> 777.80]  Pharaoh,
[778.42 --> 779.56]  wouldn't let Israel,
[779.84 --> 781.10]  the firstborn of God,
[781.50 --> 783.86]  to go and worship their true God.
[785.52 --> 788.18]  And so you can see how these Egyptian gods had names.
[790.04 --> 793.84]  These gods served the Egyptians' own self-needs
[793.84 --> 795.32]  and their own self-desires
[795.32 --> 797.52]  to fulfill everything that they wanted,
[798.08 --> 799.70]  and they just put names on everything.
[800.74 --> 801.80]  Oh, I serve this god,
[801.86 --> 802.70]  I serve this god,
[803.00 --> 805.54]  this god I serve so that they will bring rain,
[805.76 --> 807.84]  and that we will have crops so that we don't die.
[808.10 --> 810.72]  It's all so that I can have a good,
[811.54 --> 812.54]  satisfactory life,
[812.78 --> 814.80]  so that I can be happy.
[815.30 --> 816.02]  And this I,
[816.12 --> 817.24]  the biggest I here,
[817.46 --> 818.10]  is Pharaoh.
[819.46 --> 819.90]  I mean,
[819.94 --> 820.74]  when you think about it,
[820.74 --> 822.52]  we have gods today, too.
[823.52 --> 824.36]  And N.T. Wright says,
[824.82 --> 825.72]  it's the same thing.
[825.72 --> 827.60]  We have gods and idols today,
[827.84 --> 830.30]  it's just that we don't have fancy names for them.
[831.64 --> 833.94]  And we want to name some of those gods today,
[834.32 --> 834.92]  those idols.
[836.20 --> 836.62]  And so,
[836.72 --> 838.48]  as I was reading through these passages,
[838.74 --> 839.44]  and there are a lot of,
[839.78 --> 841.90]  it's about six chapters for the plagues,
[842.68 --> 844.74]  it came to mind that doing a sermon
[844.74 --> 846.24]  in the eyes,
[846.38 --> 847.52]  through the eyes of Pharaoh,
[847.56 --> 848.66]  might be a little bit interesting.
[848.66 --> 849.08]  I don't know,
[849.12 --> 851.00]  I sympathize with Pharaoh for some reason,
[851.20 --> 852.12]  as I was reading through.
[852.22 --> 853.30]  It's an interesting story.
[853.66 --> 854.92]  And Pharaoh is a little comedic,
[855.22 --> 855.86]  comedic,
[856.18 --> 857.62]  when you go through the story.
[858.64 --> 859.98]  And when you think about it,
[860.66 --> 863.90]  this adopted Jewish-Egyptian criminal,
[864.12 --> 864.60]  so Moses,
[865.52 --> 867.20]  runs away after committing murder,
[867.78 --> 869.06]  comes back after 40 years,
[869.12 --> 869.52]  and says,
[869.88 --> 870.70]  let my people go.
[871.54 --> 873.86]  His whole entire workforce,
[874.44 --> 876.00]  this criminal comes back and says,
[876.06 --> 876.54]  let them go.
[876.54 --> 877.02]  Why?
[878.76 --> 880.78]  So that they can go and worship a god
[880.78 --> 881.54]  that you don't even know.
[883.30 --> 884.48]  Let me think about it.
[884.64 --> 885.12]  Okay, no.
[887.66 --> 889.74]  He's warned multiple times.
[890.10 --> 891.04]  And multiple times,
[891.18 --> 892.76]  it seems like he gives up.
[893.08 --> 894.28]  I don't know if you've seen the movie,
[894.38 --> 894.94]  Prince of Egypt.
[895.68 --> 896.44]  In my opinion,
[896.50 --> 897.98]  I don't think that movie does it justice,
[898.22 --> 898.58]  obviously.
[898.90 --> 900.86]  It doesn't portray all the details
[900.86 --> 901.76]  that I think are important.
[902.12 --> 902.62]  But Pharaoh,
[902.94 --> 905.04]  it seems like he's about to give up,
[905.10 --> 905.52]  and then he's like,
[905.52 --> 905.72]  nope,
[905.72 --> 906.48]  oh, no,
[906.52 --> 907.26]  I don't want to let you go.
[909.12 --> 911.66]  He literally strengthens his heart.
[912.16 --> 913.14]  In our NIV Bible,
[913.26 --> 914.82]  it says like he hardens his heart
[914.82 --> 916.86]  to maintain his empire,
[917.04 --> 919.04]  which is literally made on the backs
[919.04 --> 920.66]  of his Israelite slaves.
[922.16 --> 923.22]  And so let's take a moment,
[923.60 --> 926.72]  and I invite you to sympathize with Pharaoh
[926.72 --> 927.44]  just for a second.
[928.54 --> 929.30]  Think about it.
[929.32 --> 931.20]  It's not easy letting go of what you think
[931.20 --> 932.86]  is the ultimate goal of life.
[933.44 --> 934.00]  And in Greek,
[934.08 --> 935.26]  we call this telos.
[936.00 --> 936.88]  And this telos,
[936.96 --> 938.14]  the end goal of life,
[938.54 --> 940.84]  is essentially to worship oneself.
[941.06 --> 942.28]  This is the story of the world.
[943.56 --> 946.02]  It is to live solely for one's own happiness
[946.02 --> 948.78]  and then try to make room a little bit
[948.78 --> 950.20]  for others' happiness
[950.20 --> 953.78]  if it suffices to your own desires.
[954.98 --> 957.30]  This self-worshipping story of the world
[957.30 --> 961.02]  is what the Bible defines as sinful nature.
[961.02 --> 962.52]  It is sin itself.
[964.12 --> 965.72]  In our Western world,
[966.22 --> 968.94]  and I would include many developing Eastern countries
[968.94 --> 970.40]  like Korea, where I come from,
[970.50 --> 971.12]  where I was born,
[971.80 --> 975.54]  where money, pluralism, sexual expression,
[975.70 --> 977.32]  Korea is a little bit behind in this one,
[977.44 --> 978.58]  in this category, I would say.
[979.14 --> 980.86]  But here, media consumption,
[981.44 --> 983.00]  I think is one of the biggest ones.
[984.00 --> 986.48]  These are idols that are born out of
[986.48 --> 987.30]  what I would suggest
[987.30 --> 991.28]  is born out of self-centeredness and selfishness.
[993.22 --> 995.70]  And so let's pick on this one idol today
[995.70 --> 997.90]  that I think is very important for us.
[999.36 --> 1002.82]  We talk about the dangers of media consumption.
[1004.02 --> 1007.14]  At least I hope that churches talk about this idol.
[1008.52 --> 1009.36]  Most of us,
[1009.90 --> 1012.06]  and here, I mean most of us,
[1012.48 --> 1015.44]  don't even try to think about it right now.
[1015.50 --> 1016.28]  Oh, media consumption.
[1016.42 --> 1016.68]  Oh, yeah.
[1017.08 --> 1017.80]  Those youth.
[1018.46 --> 1018.82]  Oh, yeah.
[1019.14 --> 1020.52]  They're on their phones every day.
[1020.98 --> 1022.46]  They're so influenced by the media.
[1022.80 --> 1023.90]  No, don't even go there.
[1024.44 --> 1024.72]  Right?
[1025.12 --> 1025.54]  It's like,
[1025.66 --> 1027.28]  I learned this when I was at school.
[1027.40 --> 1027.64]  It's like,
[1027.68 --> 1029.18]  when you point one finger at somebody,
[1029.40 --> 1030.98]  how many fingers are pointing back at you?
[1032.30 --> 1032.66]  Three.
[1032.66 --> 1032.72]  Three.
[1032.92 --> 1033.56]  Well, this one,
[1033.62 --> 1034.94]  I don't know what you do with the thumb.
[1035.74 --> 1036.04]  I think,
[1036.36 --> 1038.14]  I don't think anybody points like this.
[1038.56 --> 1039.52]  So when you point like this,
[1039.58 --> 1041.18]  at least three is pointing back to you.
[1041.72 --> 1043.04]  What I'm trying to say is that
[1043.04 --> 1045.92]  media consumption does not pertain to our youth.
[1045.92 --> 1049.60]  It pertains to all generations right now
[1049.60 --> 1051.18]  living in our Western world.
[1052.50 --> 1055.40]  And so when you think about this idol that we have,
[1057.22 --> 1057.82]  it's not,
[1058.32 --> 1059.90]  sorry, I lost my place.
[1060.70 --> 1063.20]  It's not like we don't know that we're being influenced.
[1064.90 --> 1066.06]  We talk about it.
[1066.28 --> 1066.64]  And we say,
[1066.68 --> 1067.54]  oh, yeah, media consumption.
[1067.64 --> 1069.16]  Oh, yeah, we should reduce our screen time.
[1069.40 --> 1070.22]  So even Apple,
[1070.38 --> 1071.08]  they're helping us out.
[1071.10 --> 1071.52]  Oh, sorry,
[1071.58 --> 1072.42]  whatever phone you use.
[1072.56 --> 1073.52]  They're helping us out.
[1073.52 --> 1075.94]  They show you how many hours you're on your phone.
[1076.54 --> 1077.88]  And it makes you realize,
[1078.06 --> 1080.34]  it's like an angel of God telling you,
[1080.58 --> 1082.02]  you're on your phone too much.
[1083.00 --> 1084.48]  But that's not an angel of God.
[1084.58 --> 1085.06]  That's like,
[1085.44 --> 1087.48]  that's Apple trying to make their image better.
[1088.20 --> 1088.44]  Right?
[1088.54 --> 1088.76]  Saying,
[1088.88 --> 1090.16]  oh, we're trying to,
[1090.16 --> 1090.46]  you know,
[1090.58 --> 1092.08]  think about the health of our customers.
[1092.56 --> 1093.84]  Don't be on your phone so much.
[1094.14 --> 1096.22]  It actually is bad on your wrists as well.
[1096.34 --> 1098.00]  It has physical damage that it does
[1098.00 --> 1098.98]  to your eyes,
[1099.14 --> 1099.84]  to your wrists,
[1100.24 --> 1102.24]  obviously to your mental health.
[1102.24 --> 1106.76]  And I'm not just trying to be legalistic here
[1106.76 --> 1107.76]  and telling everyone,
[1108.18 --> 1109.64]  you guys are doing a horrible job.
[1109.86 --> 1110.72]  Get off your phones.
[1111.10 --> 1112.34]  You gotta try harder.
[1113.96 --> 1115.56]  That part, I think, is a given.
[1116.02 --> 1117.62]  I think we should always try harder.
[1119.14 --> 1119.90]  We're sinners.
[1120.56 --> 1121.16]  We're naturally,
[1122.22 --> 1123.64]  we naturally have a tendency
[1123.64 --> 1125.54]  and an automatic setting
[1125.54 --> 1127.02]  to go against God
[1127.02 --> 1130.14]  and to live as if we are gods ourselves.
[1130.14 --> 1133.20]  And so we need to realize this
[1133.20 --> 1134.80]  and always make an effort
[1134.80 --> 1136.54]  to get off our phones,
[1137.10 --> 1139.10]  to not be influenced by our media.
[1141.00 --> 1142.18]  It's simple enough.
[1142.38 --> 1143.04]  But I think,
[1144.00 --> 1145.86]  and what I'm concerned about more,
[1146.38 --> 1147.70]  is the message
[1147.70 --> 1150.26]  that the media is trying to convey to us.
[1154.10 --> 1156.74]  Our media subtly tries to convey
[1156.74 --> 1158.02]  certain unbiblical
[1158.02 --> 1160.02]  and ungodly messages
[1160.02 --> 1160.84]  things,
[1161.04 --> 1161.56]  concepts,
[1162.02 --> 1162.90]  as if it's normal.
[1163.00 --> 1164.58]  It's not like they blatantly come out
[1164.58 --> 1164.88]  and say,
[1165.12 --> 1166.74]  hey, here's a satanic message.
[1167.24 --> 1168.52]  This is really unbiblical.
[1169.00 --> 1170.08]  Don't listen to us.
[1170.72 --> 1172.30]  Satan does not work that way.
[1172.46 --> 1173.48]  Satan is beautiful.
[1174.04 --> 1175.82]  Satan is really tempting.
[1176.34 --> 1178.00]  And so whatever subtle message
[1178.00 --> 1179.56]  that we hear from the media,
[1179.94 --> 1180.56]  we think,
[1180.74 --> 1180.96]  oh,
[1181.52 --> 1181.84]  oh,
[1181.92 --> 1182.76]  I think that's right.
[1183.26 --> 1183.54]  Oh yeah,
[1183.58 --> 1184.36]  that makes sense.
[1186.04 --> 1187.54]  Sometimes you don't even think about it.
[1187.58 --> 1187.78]  It's just,
[1187.84 --> 1188.06]  oh yeah,
[1188.06 --> 1188.66]  that's normal.
[1189.86 --> 1190.48]  And so for me,
[1190.82 --> 1191.40]  taking this
[1191.40 --> 1193.22]  and reflecting on my own sinfulness,
[1193.78 --> 1196.18]  I grew up watching The Friends
[1196.18 --> 1197.62]  and The Office.
[1197.80 --> 1199.14]  So that's my generation.
[1199.72 --> 1199.80]  Well,
[1199.86 --> 1201.12]  Friends is a little bit before,
[1201.24 --> 1202.16]  but I love,
[1202.56 --> 1203.22]  don't judge me,
[1203.28 --> 1204.24]  but I love The Friends
[1204.24 --> 1205.12]  and I love The Office.
[1205.46 --> 1206.64]  Those are great shows.
[1206.64 --> 1208.84]  But through those shows,
[1209.18 --> 1209.76]  and I watched,
[1210.10 --> 1211.32]  I did a binge watching
[1211.32 --> 1212.18]  with Friends.
[1212.30 --> 1213.74]  I wanted to educate my wife
[1213.74 --> 1214.70]  on a little more
[1214.70 --> 1216.28]  of a North American culture.
[1216.60 --> 1218.14]  This is what North America is about,
[1218.70 --> 1220.32]  which is not a good thing.
[1220.74 --> 1224.04]  But as we were binge watching The Friends,
[1225.08 --> 1227.90]  and this was a couple years ago,
[1227.98 --> 1230.26]  so this was after my education
[1230.26 --> 1231.36]  in Bible college,
[1231.80 --> 1232.96]  my six years experience
[1232.96 --> 1233.94]  in a Christian school,
[1234.08 --> 1235.46]  thinking about worldviews,
[1235.46 --> 1236.56]  Christian worldviews,
[1236.64 --> 1238.10]  and then entering into region,
[1238.32 --> 1239.84]  and then binge watching The Friends.
[1240.00 --> 1240.48]  Try that.
[1242.48 --> 1244.60]  It automatically makes you realize,
[1245.78 --> 1246.16]  dang,
[1246.94 --> 1248.14]  this show is terrible.
[1249.50 --> 1251.16]  What are they trying to say?
[1253.20 --> 1254.22]  Everything is about,
[1254.32 --> 1254.58]  oh,
[1254.78 --> 1255.88]  I want to be happy.
[1256.10 --> 1256.22]  Oh,
[1256.26 --> 1257.54]  I broke up with this guy again.
[1257.60 --> 1257.74]  Oh,
[1257.74 --> 1258.84]  I broke up with her again.
[1258.84 --> 1260.68]  And I want to be happy.
[1260.80 --> 1261.04]  Oh,
[1261.18 --> 1262.94]  I have a good job,
[1263.06 --> 1264.30]  but I'm not satisfied with it.
[1264.34 --> 1265.18]  I'm making good money,
[1265.32 --> 1266.28]  but I want a better job
[1266.28 --> 1267.10]  that I'm happy with.
[1267.60 --> 1269.52]  And those are not terrible messages.
[1270.18 --> 1271.58]  Those are not wrong messages.
[1272.00 --> 1273.30]  People live that way.
[1273.44 --> 1273.68]  Yes,
[1273.90 --> 1276.38]  we want to find a gift.
[1276.50 --> 1278.90]  We have different vocab for this.
[1279.02 --> 1280.96]  We want to find different vocations
[1280.96 --> 1283.50]  and gifts to serve our God.
[1283.50 --> 1285.48]  But in shows like this,
[1285.56 --> 1286.02]  it's about,
[1286.36 --> 1286.46]  no,
[1286.54 --> 1287.54]  I want to be happy.
[1288.08 --> 1289.92]  This job does not make me happy.
[1290.66 --> 1292.50]  This friend does not make me happy.
[1292.80 --> 1294.66]  This boyfriend does not make me happy.
[1295.04 --> 1295.60]  In the end,
[1296.24 --> 1296.50]  oh,
[1296.94 --> 1297.40]  spoiler?
[1297.82 --> 1299.62]  I don't think our younger generation
[1299.62 --> 1300.48]  is going to watch this,
[1300.62 --> 1301.54]  but in the end,
[1302.02 --> 1303.28]  Ross is the guy for me.
[1303.86 --> 1304.14]  You know?
[1306.48 --> 1306.96]  Okay,
[1307.08 --> 1308.30]  so some of you watched it.
[1308.42 --> 1308.62]  Okay.
[1308.62 --> 1308.68]  Okay.
[1308.68 --> 1313.46]  So turn around and reflect.
[1313.80 --> 1315.82]  Is that the end goal for us?
[1318.02 --> 1319.54]  Simply to have friends
[1319.54 --> 1320.96]  that love me
[1320.96 --> 1322.38]  and that I live
[1322.38 --> 1322.94]  in a nice,
[1323.10 --> 1323.94]  comfortable apartment
[1323.94 --> 1324.84]  in New York City
[1324.84 --> 1327.14]  and a great paying job
[1327.14 --> 1328.12]  that I'm passionate about?
[1328.52 --> 1329.88]  Is that the telos,
[1330.16 --> 1331.42]  the end goal of our lives?
[1334.36 --> 1336.42]  Why did God free His people,
[1336.42 --> 1336.94]  Israel,
[1337.38 --> 1338.02]  from slavery,
[1338.02 --> 1339.84]  from religious bondage?
[1341.00 --> 1342.70]  And why did He free us
[1342.70 --> 1344.42]  from bondage to sin
[1344.42 --> 1345.52]  through the blood of the Lamb?
[1347.32 --> 1349.22]  I suggest it's the same purpose
[1349.22 --> 1350.56]  that we find here in Exodus.
[1351.08 --> 1351.70]  That one,
[1352.32 --> 1353.80]  it's so that everyone
[1353.80 --> 1355.26]  that's around us
[1355.26 --> 1356.60]  and us ourselves,
[1356.72 --> 1357.48]  we may witness
[1357.48 --> 1358.74]  as we worship together
[1358.74 --> 1360.42]  the true God.
[1360.70 --> 1361.16]  Yahweh,
[1361.42 --> 1362.18]  the God of Israel,
[1362.32 --> 1363.64]  the God of His church,
[1363.64 --> 1365.64]  is the God of all creation.
[1366.54 --> 1367.02]  And two,
[1367.02 --> 1370.40]  so that we may truly live
[1370.40 --> 1372.36]  in worship of our God.
[1373.50 --> 1375.04]  That is our telos,
[1375.18 --> 1376.76]  not what the friends
[1376.76 --> 1377.72]  in office is saying.
[1379.44 --> 1380.20]  And so,
[1380.28 --> 1381.44]  let's transition back
[1381.44 --> 1383.12]  for Pharaoh.
[1384.12 --> 1384.96]  For Pharaoh,
[1385.06 --> 1386.24]  it wasn't this simple
[1386.24 --> 1386.90]  comedic,
[1386.90 --> 1388.62]  you know,
[1389.02 --> 1390.58]  idea of friends being happy,
[1390.68 --> 1391.78]  having good friends around them.
[1391.82 --> 1392.44]  He probably wanted
[1392.44 --> 1393.38]  good friends around him.
[1394.24 --> 1396.32]  But for the Pharaoh,
[1396.48 --> 1397.32]  his telos
[1397.32 --> 1399.68]  was his vast empire.
[1401.64 --> 1402.16]  Ironically,
[1402.30 --> 1403.50]  during this time of bondage,
[1403.80 --> 1405.12]  this Egyptian empire
[1405.12 --> 1407.20]  was what defined
[1407.20 --> 1409.36]  Israel's existence as well.
[1409.76 --> 1411.12]  It was forced on them.
[1411.24 --> 1412.30]  It was their telos
[1412.30 --> 1414.82]  without them even having a choice.
[1415.02 --> 1416.12]  It wasn't a good one,
[1416.12 --> 1417.42]  but it was all they had.
[1417.42 --> 1419.00]  And so,
[1419.38 --> 1420.88]  they were satisfied
[1420.88 --> 1421.74]  with what they had.
[1421.84 --> 1422.70]  At least they weren't,
[1422.96 --> 1423.26]  you know,
[1423.38 --> 1424.14]  going hungry
[1424.14 --> 1425.06]  like they were
[1425.06 --> 1425.62]  in the desert,
[1425.88 --> 1426.38]  in the wilderness.
[1427.46 --> 1427.82]  And so,
[1428.44 --> 1428.90]  obviously,
[1429.04 --> 1429.94]  God already knew
[1429.94 --> 1430.98]  their hearts and minds,
[1431.20 --> 1432.30]  just like God knows
[1432.30 --> 1433.42]  our hearts and minds.
[1434.10 --> 1435.64]  It says in Exodus 13,
[1435.72 --> 1436.26]  17,
[1436.26 --> 1438.14]  if they,
[1438.42 --> 1438.96]  the Israelites,
[1439.60 --> 1440.28]  face war,
[1440.68 --> 1441.80]  they might change their minds
[1441.80 --> 1442.74]  and return to Egypt.
[1443.26 --> 1444.18]  Even though I freed them,
[1444.48 --> 1446.02]  even though I did all this,
[1446.54 --> 1447.18]  I'm pretty sure
[1447.18 --> 1448.06]  they're going to go back.
[1448.78 --> 1449.08]  And,
[1449.48 --> 1450.08]  evidently,
[1450.20 --> 1451.10]  in Exodus 14,
[1451.42 --> 1452.20]  we can see how
[1452.20 --> 1453.08]  they say to Moses,
[1453.30 --> 1453.94]  so the Israelites
[1453.94 --> 1454.92]  complaining to Moses,
[1455.44 --> 1456.66]  didn't we say to you in Egypt,
[1456.78 --> 1457.48]  leave us alone,
[1458.00 --> 1459.02]  let us serve the Egyptians.
[1459.02 --> 1460.74]  It would have been better
[1460.74 --> 1461.92]  for us to serve the Egyptians
[1461.92 --> 1463.24]  than to die here
[1463.24 --> 1463.88]  in this wilderness.
[1465.30 --> 1465.68]  Curse you,
[1465.74 --> 1465.94]  Moses.
[1466.92 --> 1469.08]  After all what God has done,
[1469.38 --> 1470.46]  had done for them.
[1472.34 --> 1473.68]  As God continued
[1473.68 --> 1475.44]  to break that religious bondage
[1475.44 --> 1476.10]  to Egypt,
[1476.38 --> 1477.02]  which, again,
[1477.22 --> 1480.14]  incorporates all aspects of life,
[1481.18 --> 1482.32]  they were being shaped
[1482.32 --> 1484.86]  into a new bondage,
[1485.34 --> 1486.32]  a new story
[1486.32 --> 1488.38]  that relies on God
[1488.38 --> 1489.78]  as their only hope.
[1492.00 --> 1492.36]  It only,
[1492.66 --> 1493.54]  it didn't come easy.
[1493.72 --> 1494.84]  This new shaping
[1494.84 --> 1495.86]  does not come easy.
[1496.74 --> 1497.74]  We are shaped
[1497.74 --> 1498.94]  to the ways
[1498.94 --> 1499.78]  of this world,
[1500.04 --> 1500.74]  we ourselves.
[1500.98 --> 1501.76]  And when God
[1501.76 --> 1503.02]  breaks that bondage
[1503.02 --> 1503.84]  and shapes us
[1503.84 --> 1505.52]  into His story,
[1505.86 --> 1506.70]  it hurts.
[1507.02 --> 1507.92]  It hurts a lot.
[1509.48 --> 1510.32]  It hurts
[1510.32 --> 1511.62]  when I have to think about
[1511.62 --> 1512.84]  how I grew up
[1512.84 --> 1513.30]  with the friends
[1513.30 --> 1514.88]  and how I wanted good friends
[1514.88 --> 1516.18]  and how I wanted happy life.
[1516.34 --> 1517.08]  And God's saying,
[1517.20 --> 1517.36]  no,
[1517.48 --> 1518.72]  I am your happy life.
[1518.72 --> 1521.14]  It doesn't,
[1521.32 --> 1522.04]  it hurts.
[1522.28 --> 1523.00]  I know it,
[1523.24 --> 1523.78]  but it hurts
[1523.78 --> 1524.94]  to always be shaped
[1524.94 --> 1525.96]  when I'm trying
[1525.96 --> 1526.86]  to live for my own.
[1530.22 --> 1531.26]  For the Israelites,
[1531.94 --> 1532.30]  I mean,
[1532.42 --> 1533.02]  no big deal.
[1533.08 --> 1533.72]  It only takes
[1533.72 --> 1535.14]  like the whole Old Testament
[1535.14 --> 1536.82]  to finally bring in Jesus
[1536.82 --> 1538.56]  to break that bondage
[1538.56 --> 1539.00]  to sin
[1539.00 --> 1540.04]  once and for all.
[1541.60 --> 1541.82]  Okay.
[1542.50 --> 1543.50]  Now to the plagues.
[1543.66 --> 1544.28]  I'm going to speed
[1544.28 --> 1544.94]  through this part.
[1545.74 --> 1546.54]  If you get a chance
[1546.54 --> 1547.26]  to read the story
[1547.26 --> 1547.76]  of the plagues,
[1547.82 --> 1548.70]  it's actually interesting.
[1549.02 --> 1549.68]  It progresses
[1549.68 --> 1550.48]  more and more
[1550.48 --> 1551.26]  as Pharaoh
[1551.26 --> 1552.62]  has nothing to rely on.
[1552.80 --> 1553.76]  It's very progressive.
[1554.30 --> 1554.70]  And so,
[1555.44 --> 1556.54]  from the first
[1556.54 --> 1557.64]  to the third plague,
[1558.38 --> 1559.58]  Pharaoh's main
[1559.58 --> 1562.24]  party that he relies on
[1562.24 --> 1564.12]  are his magicians.
[1564.44 --> 1565.60]  So the magicians
[1565.60 --> 1566.98]  imitate the plagues
[1566.98 --> 1567.52]  of God
[1567.52 --> 1568.32]  for the first three
[1568.32 --> 1569.16]  and they try
[1569.16 --> 1570.12]  to do the same thing.
[1570.52 --> 1571.02]  And they imitate
[1571.02 --> 1572.26]  and they are able
[1572.26 --> 1573.08]  to even the snake.
[1573.08 --> 1574.24]  Although that's not a plague.
[1574.74 --> 1575.96]  When Moses throws down
[1575.96 --> 1576.38]  his staff
[1576.38 --> 1577.32]  and becomes a snake,
[1577.52 --> 1578.84]  the magicians do the same thing
[1578.84 --> 1579.60]  with their own sticks.
[1579.98 --> 1580.38]  But then,
[1580.74 --> 1581.08]  again,
[1581.36 --> 1582.34]  God shows his power.
[1582.76 --> 1583.30]  God's snake
[1583.30 --> 1584.24]  eats up their snakes.
[1584.66 --> 1584.92]  And then,
[1585.02 --> 1586.84]  for the first three plagues,
[1587.54 --> 1588.46]  they do the same thing.
[1588.52 --> 1588.88]  They imitate,
[1589.10 --> 1589.68]  but it's weaker.
[1590.02 --> 1590.30]  And so,
[1590.46 --> 1591.10]  Pharaoh's like,
[1592.00 --> 1592.68]  what's up guys?
[1592.74 --> 1593.44]  I thought you guys
[1593.44 --> 1594.84]  had gods on your side too.
[1594.98 --> 1595.72]  Why is their god
[1595.72 --> 1596.30]  more powerful?
[1596.60 --> 1597.70]  And then the magicians say,
[1597.80 --> 1598.42]  I don't know.
[1598.90 --> 1599.34]  And then,
[1599.64 --> 1600.08]  specifically,
[1600.32 --> 1600.72]  they say,
[1601.10 --> 1602.12]  I think this is
[1602.12 --> 1603.28]  the finger of God,
[1603.86 --> 1604.70]  they actually say.
[1605.06 --> 1605.98]  They acknowledge
[1605.98 --> 1607.06]  that they think,
[1607.32 --> 1607.46]  okay,
[1607.52 --> 1608.44]  this is a real god
[1608.44 --> 1609.26]  we're dealing with here.
[1610.54 --> 1611.72]  After the fourth plague,
[1612.28 --> 1612.82]  so the Pharaoh
[1612.82 --> 1613.78]  promises Moses,
[1614.12 --> 1614.32]  okay,
[1614.70 --> 1616.50]  I will let you go
[1616.50 --> 1617.50]  to offer sacrifice
[1617.50 --> 1618.56]  to the Lord,
[1618.90 --> 1619.80]  capital L-O-R-D,
[1619.90 --> 1620.20]  Yahweh,
[1620.34 --> 1620.96]  your God.
[1621.92 --> 1622.90]  Go into the wilderness
[1622.90 --> 1623.68]  and you can worship.
[1624.04 --> 1624.26]  But,
[1624.62 --> 1626.60]  don't go too far.
[1627.08 --> 1627.76]  Now pray for me.
[1627.86 --> 1628.70]  Get rid of these plagues.
[1628.70 --> 1631.74]  Don't go too far.
[1632.38 --> 1632.72]  Or,
[1632.92 --> 1633.44]  I might,
[1633.76 --> 1634.26]  more like,
[1634.38 --> 1635.58]  I will change my mind.
[1636.84 --> 1637.82]  His heart and mind
[1637.82 --> 1639.32]  were still grasping
[1639.32 --> 1641.16]  with an ever-growing firmness
[1641.16 --> 1642.02]  to the heart,
[1642.32 --> 1642.64]  to the,
[1643.72 --> 1645.74]  to not having to lose
[1645.74 --> 1647.40]  his whole entire workforce.
[1647.70 --> 1649.10]  His empire depends on it.
[1649.34 --> 1650.16]  He did not want
[1650.16 --> 1650.90]  to let that go.
[1651.14 --> 1651.90]  Don't go too far.
[1651.98 --> 1652.14]  Okay,
[1652.34 --> 1653.64]  you can go just right over there.
[1654.26 --> 1654.54]  Worship,
[1654.68 --> 1655.22]  and then come back.
[1655.28 --> 1655.82]  Now pray for me.
[1655.88 --> 1656.74]  Get rid of these plagues.
[1656.74 --> 1658.26]  I want my empire back.
[1659.14 --> 1660.52]  By the seventh plague,
[1661.44 --> 1662.26]  the seventh one,
[1662.32 --> 1663.34]  which is always a good number,
[1663.40 --> 1663.56]  right?
[1664.90 --> 1666.14]  Things really get heated.
[1667.28 --> 1668.88]  Moses confronts Pharaoh saying,
[1669.28 --> 1670.60]  and he's relaying God's message,
[1670.90 --> 1672.12]  let my people go
[1672.12 --> 1673.60]  so that they may worship me.
[1673.76 --> 1675.06]  But then the message continues.
[1675.36 --> 1676.14]  This time,
[1676.54 --> 1677.54]  I will show you
[1677.54 --> 1678.76]  the full force
[1678.76 --> 1680.40]  of my plagues against you,
[1680.96 --> 1682.30]  is what God is saying to Pharaoh.
[1682.30 --> 1683.70]  By the seventh one.
[1684.50 --> 1685.06]  Good number.
[1685.06 --> 1686.88]  It gets a little comedic.
[1687.24 --> 1687.64]  Comedic.
[1687.76 --> 1687.88]  Ah,
[1687.96 --> 1688.42]  this word.
[1688.90 --> 1690.20]  It gets a little comedic
[1690.20 --> 1691.34]  by the eighth one.
[1692.90 --> 1693.52]  Pharaoh says,
[1693.64 --> 1694.62]  he will let Moses go.
[1694.74 --> 1694.90]  Okay,
[1694.98 --> 1695.22]  fine,
[1695.28 --> 1695.86]  you guys can go,
[1695.94 --> 1697.14]  but just take the men this time.
[1698.20 --> 1699.00]  Leave your wives
[1699.00 --> 1699.98]  and leave your children.
[1700.16 --> 1701.14]  We'll raise them
[1701.14 --> 1702.72]  and use them as slaves later on.
[1703.24 --> 1703.64]  You men,
[1703.80 --> 1703.98]  fine,
[1704.06 --> 1704.64]  you guys can go.
[1706.06 --> 1706.46]  Obviously,
[1706.76 --> 1707.22]  Moses says,
[1707.28 --> 1707.44]  no,
[1707.56 --> 1708.28]  that's not the deal.
[1708.64 --> 1709.76]  God wants all his people.
[1710.52 --> 1711.76]  And then by the ninth one,
[1711.76 --> 1714.24]  just as Pharaoh seems to be
[1714.24 --> 1715.64]  on the brink of giving up,
[1716.64 --> 1717.62]  what does he say?
[1718.90 --> 1719.38]  Fine,
[1719.58 --> 1720.84]  you guys are so annoying.
[1721.14 --> 1721.60]  Get out,
[1721.74 --> 1722.00]  go,
[1722.16 --> 1723.00]  take all your children
[1723.00 --> 1724.24]  and your women,
[1724.64 --> 1726.14]  but leave your livestock.
[1727.44 --> 1729.04]  What does the livestock represent?
[1730.00 --> 1731.06]  It's their money.
[1731.18 --> 1731.88]  It's their economy.
[1732.62 --> 1732.72]  So,
[1732.84 --> 1733.04]  okay,
[1733.14 --> 1733.42]  fine,
[1733.42 --> 1735.78]  if we lose the workforce,
[1736.04 --> 1737.68]  at least leave all your money with you.
[1738.12 --> 1739.40]  That's actually telling them
[1739.40 --> 1740.74]  to go and die.
[1741.26 --> 1742.52]  If they don't take their livestock,
[1742.66 --> 1743.66]  especially into the desert,
[1744.36 --> 1745.38]  how are they going to live?
[1745.84 --> 1746.02]  I mean,
[1746.04 --> 1746.56]  that's ironic.
[1746.68 --> 1747.32]  God provides.
[1747.92 --> 1748.86]  But Pharaoh is saying,
[1749.00 --> 1749.86]  leave your money with you.
[1750.52 --> 1751.24]  I don't want to lose
[1751.24 --> 1752.12]  all of my empire.
[1753.82 --> 1755.12]  And then it is only
[1755.12 --> 1756.02]  with that last
[1756.02 --> 1757.20]  and final plague,
[1757.74 --> 1758.80]  the taking of all
[1758.80 --> 1760.00]  the firstborn sons
[1760.00 --> 1761.00]  and animals,
[1761.14 --> 1761.48]  actually,
[1762.60 --> 1764.06]  that puts the final nail
[1764.06 --> 1764.70]  in the coffin.
[1766.08 --> 1766.92]  God says,
[1767.32 --> 1767.98]  I'm going to take
[1767.98 --> 1768.64]  your firstborn.
[1769.46 --> 1770.84]  You did not listen to me.
[1771.18 --> 1771.96]  You strengthened
[1771.96 --> 1773.10]  your own heart
[1773.10 --> 1774.44]  to your own bondage
[1774.44 --> 1774.94]  to sin,
[1775.10 --> 1776.12]  to your empire.
[1776.46 --> 1777.62]  Now I'm going to take
[1777.62 --> 1779.54]  your firstborns.
[1779.70 --> 1780.04]  Why?
[1780.16 --> 1781.08]  Because you did not
[1781.08 --> 1782.72]  let my firstborn go.
[1785.12 --> 1785.96]  This is why
[1785.96 --> 1786.82]  in Exodus 4,
[1786.94 --> 1788.22]  God commands Moses
[1788.22 --> 1789.16]  to say to Pharaoh,
[1789.66 --> 1791.64]  Israel is my firstborn son.
[1792.02 --> 1792.94]  My son.
[1793.26 --> 1794.96]  Let my son go
[1794.96 --> 1796.72]  so that he may worship me.
[1796.72 --> 1798.30]  He calls Israel
[1798.30 --> 1798.74]  his son.
[1800.04 --> 1801.10]  And in chapter 13,
[1801.90 --> 1803.00]  all Israel is to
[1803.00 --> 1803.74]  consecrate
[1803.74 --> 1806.28]  all firstborn males
[1806.28 --> 1807.36]  and animals
[1807.36 --> 1808.92]  in worship
[1808.92 --> 1811.02]  to God.
[1813.50 --> 1815.78]  And so that's a brief summary
[1815.78 --> 1816.78]  of all the ten plagues.
[1818.62 --> 1819.46]  And so you ask,
[1819.84 --> 1820.80]  why did God do
[1820.80 --> 1822.14]  all these devastating things?
[1822.14 --> 1825.42]  What is his purpose
[1825.42 --> 1826.72]  behind these
[1826.72 --> 1828.82]  horrendous,
[1828.84 --> 1829.40]  you can say,
[1829.56 --> 1830.02]  plagues?
[1832.14 --> 1833.26]  Well, it goes back
[1833.26 --> 1834.18]  to that main purpose
[1834.18 --> 1834.88]  that we talked about
[1834.88 --> 1835.24]  at the beginning
[1835.24 --> 1835.72]  of the sermon.
[1836.38 --> 1836.80]  First,
[1837.30 --> 1839.10]  so that the paganistic world
[1839.10 --> 1840.38]  surrounding God's people
[1840.38 --> 1841.36]  may witness
[1841.36 --> 1843.24]  who the real God is,
[1843.44 --> 1844.60]  the capital G God,
[1844.70 --> 1846.60]  not all the little fake gods,
[1846.90 --> 1848.74]  but the one and only God,
[1849.08 --> 1849.46]  Yahweh.
[1849.46 --> 1852.62]  Exodus 9, 16.
[1853.42 --> 1854.82]  But I have raised you up
[1854.82 --> 1856.08]  for this very purpose.
[1856.40 --> 1857.02]  And God is talking
[1857.02 --> 1857.86]  about the Pharaoh here.
[1858.54 --> 1859.68]  That I might show you
[1859.68 --> 1860.44]  my power
[1860.44 --> 1861.70]  and that my name
[1861.70 --> 1862.40]  might be proclaimed
[1862.40 --> 1864.16]  in all the earth.
[1865.22 --> 1865.92]  And specifically
[1865.92 --> 1866.72]  for Israel,
[1867.00 --> 1867.92]  Exodus 10, 12.
[1868.16 --> 1869.12]  That you may tell
[1869.12 --> 1869.46]  your children,
[1870.46 --> 1872.46]  your children,
[1872.84 --> 1874.46]  and your grandchildren
[1874.46 --> 1878.22]  how I dealt harshly
[1878.22 --> 1878.82]  with the Egyptians
[1878.82 --> 1880.14]  and how I performed
[1880.14 --> 1881.54]  many signs among them
[1881.54 --> 1882.62]  that you may know
[1882.62 --> 1884.08]  that I am,
[1884.68 --> 1887.36]  I am the Lord.
[1888.62 --> 1889.86]  Ani Adonai.
[1891.60 --> 1892.44]  And the second part
[1892.44 --> 1893.18]  of this dual purpose
[1893.18 --> 1894.20]  is that as everyone
[1894.20 --> 1895.44]  witnessed these immense
[1895.44 --> 1896.34]  chain of events,
[1896.96 --> 1897.64]  God was working
[1897.64 --> 1898.38]  to fulfill
[1898.38 --> 1899.60]  that Abrahamic covenant.
[1899.60 --> 1901.40]  go to a land
[1901.40 --> 1902.34]  that I will show you
[1902.34 --> 1903.72]  and be a blessing
[1903.72 --> 1905.54]  to all the nations.
[1906.76 --> 1908.22]  How can this blessing happen?
[1909.48 --> 1910.96]  Obviously by worshiping
[1910.96 --> 1911.92]  their true God.
[1912.60 --> 1913.76]  But you can't
[1913.76 --> 1915.14]  worship your true God
[1915.14 --> 1916.06]  when you're in
[1916.06 --> 1917.02]  religious bondage
[1917.02 --> 1917.52]  to Egypt.
[1919.34 --> 1920.20]  It's not like
[1920.20 --> 1920.98]  they could have stayed
[1920.98 --> 1921.42]  in Egypt
[1921.42 --> 1922.76]  and then go out
[1922.76 --> 1923.88]  and work on the fields,
[1924.28 --> 1924.90]  serve Pharaoh,
[1925.08 --> 1926.00]  okay, here's your money,
[1926.14 --> 1926.84]  here's our work,
[1926.84 --> 1928.22]  and then later on
[1928.22 --> 1930.32]  go to your private homes
[1930.32 --> 1930.68]  and like,
[1930.92 --> 1931.74]  Yahweh, we love you,
[1931.80 --> 1932.72]  we only worship you.
[1934.08 --> 1935.34]  This dichotomy,
[1935.48 --> 1936.30]  this separation
[1936.30 --> 1938.38]  between a public social life
[1938.38 --> 1939.96]  to a private home life,
[1940.16 --> 1941.04]  a religious life,
[1941.10 --> 1941.94]  did not exist.
[1943.02 --> 1944.08]  And arguably
[1944.08 --> 1945.52]  it does not exist today.
[1948.76 --> 1950.02]  And so as we come
[1950.02 --> 1950.82]  to a close today,
[1951.16 --> 1952.48]  I want to leave you
[1952.48 --> 1953.26]  with this question
[1953.26 --> 1953.96]  for ourselves.
[1955.02 --> 1956.54]  How are we bound
[1956.54 --> 1957.54]  to the ways
[1957.54 --> 1958.08]  of the world?
[1959.50 --> 1961.14]  What religious bondage
[1961.14 --> 1961.82]  did God,
[1962.02 --> 1962.52]  through the blood
[1962.52 --> 1963.08]  of the Lamb,
[1963.20 --> 1964.00]  free us from?
[1965.48 --> 1966.94]  Is it the media consumption
[1966.94 --> 1968.08]  that John talked about today?
[1969.14 --> 1970.16]  Is it the greed?
[1970.92 --> 1971.86]  Is it pluralism?
[1972.52 --> 1973.92]  Is it sexual expression?
[1974.66 --> 1975.84]  Big topic here in Canada.
[1977.68 --> 1979.64]  God, our true hero,
[1980.10 --> 1981.90]  frees us from all our sins.
[1982.22 --> 1983.20]  Not a single one
[1983.20 --> 1984.28]  is powerful enough
[1984.28 --> 1985.72]  to defeat our God.
[1986.54 --> 1987.32]  God, our God,
[1987.32 --> 1988.14]  God, our true love.
[1988.14 --> 1989.34]  God, our true love.
[1989.34 --> 1990.22]  Yes, sometimes
[1990.22 --> 1991.24]  it may hurt
[1991.24 --> 1992.96]  and that's why we lament.
[1993.72 --> 1994.40]  One of the reasons
[1994.40 --> 1994.96]  we lament
[1994.96 --> 1996.44]  is because we feel
[1996.44 --> 1997.02]  like sometimes,
[1997.14 --> 1997.90]  God, why do you
[1997.90 --> 1998.92]  leave me in sin?
[1999.70 --> 2000.86]  I want to get
[2000.86 --> 2001.68]  over this hump.
[2001.96 --> 2002.68]  I don't want
[2002.68 --> 2003.14]  this sin
[2003.14 --> 2003.74]  to be ruling
[2003.74 --> 2004.58]  over my life.
[2005.08 --> 2005.90]  God, take this
[2005.90 --> 2006.64]  away from me.
[2008.64 --> 2010.28]  But this is
[2010.28 --> 2011.14]  an act of grace.
[2011.80 --> 2012.96]  God is shaping us,
[2013.00 --> 2013.48]  like I said,
[2013.48 --> 2018.22]  and it hurts so that we may turn our face toward God
[2018.22 --> 2021.70]  and see that is our telos, our end goal.
[2023.14 --> 2025.64]  And He is the true God of all creation.
[2027.92 --> 2030.74]  Isn't it beautifully ironic where it seems like
[2030.74 --> 2034.74]  where our sins increase, grace abounds all the more?
[2038.90 --> 2042.84]  In God's perfect ways, He trains us to realize our sinfulness,
[2042.84 --> 2047.34]  to realize it, to show us the freedom we have only in Christ.
[2048.14 --> 2053.80]  Whether it be voluntarily sinning or involuntarily being influenced by sin,
[2054.76 --> 2060.14]  God trains us and makes us realize that we are being shaped into a new story.
[2061.20 --> 2063.74]  And therefore, sisters and brothers of hope,
[2064.46 --> 2068.76]  find comfort and encouragement that our God continues to guide
[2068.76 --> 2071.12]  and strengthen us into this new story.
[2071.12 --> 2074.64]  It is by His power, not ours.
[2076.00 --> 2078.32]  And so let me finish today's sermon by reading an encouragement
[2078.32 --> 2081.36]  from Moses himself, speaking to God's people.
[2084.72 --> 2086.60]  And praise team, you guys, worship team,
[2086.68 --> 2088.68]  you guys can make your way up after I read this verse.
[2088.68 --> 2106.68]  Let's pray.
[2106.68 --> 2111.50]  Let's pray.
[2111.50 --> 2111.52]  Let's pray.
[2111.52 --> 2126.66]  Father God, just, merciful, powerful God,
[2127.22 --> 2129.28]  we come to you as your people.
[2129.28 --> 2132.48]  Lord, we come to you in humility,
[2132.48 --> 2135.46]  in true humility, that acknowledges, Lord,
[2136.08 --> 2137.94]  you are our true hero.
[2139.08 --> 2142.16]  You are the one who breaks all of our bondage to sin.
[2143.68 --> 2148.62]  Lord, may we realize how weak and fragile we are,
[2149.16 --> 2151.34]  that we are being influenced,
[2151.34 --> 2156.30]  and many times voluntarily being influenced by our sins.
[2158.54 --> 2160.76]  And so we ask for forgiveness.
[2161.90 --> 2163.54]  We ask for your mercy.
[2164.54 --> 2168.28]  And at the same time, we ask for your strength and your power
[2168.28 --> 2172.42]  to free us, to continue to guide us,
[2172.42 --> 2176.40]  and shape us to live into your kingdom.
[2177.40 --> 2180.80]  And in turn, we may show and bring that kingdom
[2180.80 --> 2184.44]  to the whole creation, to all nations.
[2185.10 --> 2187.40]  So we give you all the glory this morning, Lord.
[2188.10 --> 2190.12]  May your spirit continue to guide us.
[2190.66 --> 2191.58]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[2192.70 --> 2193.00]  Amen.
[2194.66 --> 2197.90]  I invite you to stand as we sing our closing song.
