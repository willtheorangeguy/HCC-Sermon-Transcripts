[0.00 → 8.66] well good morning hope it is good to be together and gather around the word again this Sunday in
[8.66 → 14.82] our homes, and we're going to jump right back into our series on apprenticing with Jesus looking at
[14.82 → 21.14] the question of what does it mean when Jesus invites us and says to the church follow me here in Canada
[21.14 → 28.36] here in British Columbia here in Clayton heights and I want to just comment on a statement pastor
[28.36 → 34.38] SID made last week actually someone texted this statement last week to me he said a lot of
[34.38 → 37.38] important things especially about the role of being a pastor, but this is one of the things he
[37.38 → 44.82] said that stands I don't want to share it again he said without the gospel story I am just a slave
[44.82 → 52.16] I want to in my preaching tell the story of how Jesus liberated me from that slavery that's a
[52.16 → 58.08] powerful statement about conversion a powerful statement about apprenticing with Jesus
[58.08 → 66.08] and as SID mentioned apprenticing with Jesus is being liberated by Jesus it is Jesus by his grace
[66.08 → 71.00] and his power pulling us out of the power of sin under its weight pulling us out from the idols
[71.00 → 77.08] we serve pulling us out from the false idolatrous stories that we live in and this morning we're
[77.08 → 83.20] going to hone in on the way in which apprenticing with Jesus is resisting cultural patterns it's being
[83.20 → 89.70] pulled into a better story with a better saviour so for that I do invite you to turn to the passage
[89.70 → 96.08] Sonia already mentioned that's Romans 12 1 and 2 and for anyone who likes memorizing scripture this is
[96.08 → 101.44] one of those passages that I encourage you to memorize this is god's word for the church this
[101.44 → 109.18] morning Romans 12 1 and 2 therefore I urge you brothers and sisters in view of god's mercy to offer
[109.18 → 118.20] your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to god this is true worship do not conform to the
[118.20 → 124.48] patterns of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you'll be able to test
[124.48 → 130.68] and approve what god's will is his good pleasing and perfect will
[130.68 → 138.06] I mentioned to Val this week that I see four sermons in this passage and I only get to preach
[138.06 → 144.04] one of them this morning a number of years ago I had a chance to go to India with a friend of mine
[144.04 → 149.58] remember those days when we could get on planes and fly places, and it was one of those special trips
[149.58 → 153.76] where I was able to spend a whole week in a completely different culture in fact I've never
[153.76 → 158.88] been anywhere where I felt further away from Canada not just in terms of geography but also in terms of
[158.88 → 165.00] culture the streets the city the architecture the dress the food the temples that line the streets
[165.00 → 170.92] where I was it was so different from Canadian culture here but the highlight for both of us who
[170.92 → 176.22] went was spending time with a group of university and graduate students who became Christians many
[176.22 → 181.76] of whom not that long ago, and we got to hear the stories for several days what made them become
[181.76 → 186.56] believers and most of them the vast majority of them grew up in Hindu families in a Hindu context
[186.56 → 191.70] culture, and we got to hear how they heard Christ speak and how they came to faith in this person
[191.70 → 201.14] named Jesus but equally impacting to me was hearing them struggle with how then to live in their families
[201.14 → 207.00] Hindu families in their academic institutions with their friendships there seemed to be no part of
[207.00 → 212.52] their life where they weren't struggling with okay now I'm a disciple of Jesus living in this
[212.52 → 219.90] network of relationships in this culture that's very Hindu how do I practice my faith here what does
[219.90 → 224.30] it means to me as a student what does it mean for me as a friend what does it mean for me and my family
[224.30 → 229.36] and there's a sense in which they felt more and more that there's this mould they grew up in the Hindu
[229.36 → 236.58] mould this culture around them, and now they had broken out of that by Jesus, and they were struggling with how
[236.58 → 245.06] to live in that culture as apprentices of Jesus flying back to Canada I could not help but feel
[245.06 → 249.92] especially as I was discipling a number of international students do we have the same kind
[249.92 → 255.08] of struggle as we come to faith here in Canada as we grow in faith here in Canada do we have that
[255.08 → 260.50] same sense of struggle about how we've been broken free from the cultural mould and live distinctively
[260.50 → 267.12] as apprentices of Jesus in a different story it seems to me one of the challenges that we face and
[267.12 → 271.20] I hear this from people who come to Canada is the myth and I have to say this as often as I can the
[271.20 → 277.52] myth that Canada is a Christian culture that somehow it's favourable or neutral even towards a Christian
[277.52 → 284.42] faith when it is most evidently not and I think many people when they think about conversion to
[284.42 → 289.14] Christianity it's almost an image this is a strong image, but it's how I sometimes feel we see ourselves
[289.14 → 294.06] sort of building our identity we've got a shopping cart we're going down the aisle of life, and we're
[294.06 → 298.24] picking all these things that we want to make part of our identity so if you're an apple or android
[298.24 → 302.28] person you pick apple or android you put that in your cart that's part of your identity you're a
[302.28 → 306.76] chiefs fan or a buccaneers fan you put one of those teams in your cart that's part of your identity and
[306.76 → 310.08] then you sort of have to think okay well what faith is going to be part of my identity you pick
[310.08 → 315.02] Christianity, and it's one of those elements you add to your life that you build into your own
[315.02 → 320.00] identity or becomes another subtitle on your twitter handle sort of Jesus follower with the praying
[320.00 → 327.86] hands but do we see it as a completely different way of inhabiting this world a lens through which
[327.86 → 335.06] you see every dimension of your human life differently is it something your Christian faith that re-narrates
[335.06 → 341.48] the whole of your life because that's what apprenticeship is and that's what these Indian students were
[341.48 → 346.46] struggling with as they came to faith recognizing that there's a mould that the culture was pressing
[346.46 → 356.12] them into, and they no longer fit that mould because of Christ do we see the Canadian mould the Canadian
[356.12 → 365.42] story the secular faith of the society that we grow up in do we see how institutions schools friendships
[365.42 → 372.98] all of societal life social media forms us in a certain way we see the world a certain way we
[372.98 → 378.50] imagine what it means to be human a certain way that's different from other places in other cultures in
[378.50 → 382.14] fact if you ever have hosted someone in your home or spent time with someone from a very different
[382.14 → 390.18] culture they will notice just how western you are do you realize that when you drive to work in the
[390.18 → 396.66] morning you're being discipled in all sorts of ways just this week I was driving up Fraser highway and i
[396.66 → 402.58] was beside a bus near Willowbrook mall and I saw on the side of that bus born to shop
[402.58 → 408.90] we're being discipled do you realize that when you open Twitter or Instagram or Facebook, and you're
[408.90 → 415.22] scrolling through you're being discipled your heart is trying to be grabbed by all sorts of voices
[415.22 → 422.10] shaping you into a certain person often a consumer at their will do you see how when you turn on the
[422.10 → 427.08] television later this afternoon for football the worst sport that you're going to be discipled in a
[427.08 → 433.34] variety of ways maybe not the worst sport there are worse sports I want to share with you just briefly
[433.34 → 438.56] an experience I had a number of years ago I'm not a football fan as you already know and I was in
[438.56 → 444.12] somewhere in the states on the west coast uh we were in San Diego, and we were at this giant football
[444.12 → 448.12] stadium two teams, and we were sitting in a section of people where there are a lot of university
[448.12 → 452.22] students and by the way at football games as you fans will know there's like rituals there's like
[452.22 → 457.12] a liturgy with football and at the beginning of the game I was just fascinated by all that was
[457.12 → 462.10] happening they had the marching band on the field they had like soldiers on the field uh they had
[462.10 → 466.00] everyone stand up and sing the anthem and as they have sung the anthem they stretched out like a zillion
[466.00 → 471.86] foot size American flag over the field all the people singing, and then they had like an f-18 flying
[471.86 → 478.66] over I was looking around like this is crazy like this is discipleship this is identity formation
[478.66 → 483.38] about who you are as a person what does it mean to be at this game who you are as an American and we
[483.38 → 490.10] have the same things here in Canada maybe just not as extreme with our football do you see how you
[490.10 → 498.00] are being discipled you are being formed into a cultural pattern to see the world inhabit the world
[498.00 → 501.24] and live in a certain vision of what it means to be human
[501.24 → 510.34] to a tiny little church and I do mean a tiny little church living in Rome Paul writes these
[510.34 → 517.58] incredibly powerful words it says therefore brothers and sisters I urge you in view of god's mercy to
[517.58 → 523.92] offer your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to god this is true worship
[523.92 → 532.74] do not conform to the patterns of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
[532.74 → 539.18] then you'll be able to test and approve what god's will is his good is pleasing and his perfect will
[539.18 → 546.96] now this passage has a movement to it is starts with in view of god's mercy the gospel of grace
[546.96 → 552.50] offering your whole life as an act of worship and in order for that to happen you have to one
[552.50 → 557.98] resist the patterns of culture the idolatrous ways that you're formed in ways that are not of Christ
[557.98 → 565.20] and then learn and be transformed by the renewing of your mind which then results in discerning and
[565.20 → 572.46] living in god's good pleasing and perfect will, but it begins with an invitation to give the whole of our
[572.46 → 579.50] lives to Jesus as an act of worship and this by itself is a radical statement in the west I still think
[579.50 → 585.80] when I look around that we as Christians often divide up our lives in strange ways that we do not
[585.80 → 591.82] see in this passage sort of the secular life over here the spiritual life over there the spiritual life
[591.82 → 597.04] has Sunday morning it has some prayer time maybe youth group on Monday or Tuesday the secular life has
[597.04 → 604.78] school your work your time in the neighbourhood your vacation life god manages this I manage that you live in
[604.78 → 611.84] this bifurcated life where you don't see every dimension every portion of time every hour of the
[611.84 → 620.58] day wherever you find yourself as an act of worship do we see the whole of our lives as worship that the
[620.58 → 629.52] lives we live in these bodies as an act of worship apprenticing with Jesus is holding out before our
[629.52 → 639.68] father the entirety of life your marriage your leisure your time behind the screen your time with
[639.68 → 646.36] friends your hours at work that is an act of worship and I want to read for you a quote that comes from
[646.36 → 651.50] William Barclay you'll notice just by how he speaks it's a few years old but I love this quote he says
[651.50 → 656.68] in the summary of Paul's statement I think I have it on the screen for you Paul's saying here take your
[656.68 → 664.10] body take all the tasks that you have to do every day take the ordinary work of the shop the
[664.10 → 671.22] office the factory the shipyard the mine and offer all of that as an act of worship to god we might say
[671.22 → 679.22] I'm going to church to worship god, but we should also say I'm going to the factory the shop the office
[679.22 → 686.02] the school the garage the mine the shipyard the field the cowshed the garden the laptop I would add
[686.02 → 695.14] to worship god do you see apprenticeship that way do you see the faith that we have in Jesus as
[695.14 → 701.40] pulling us into this kind of life and for this to happen this is a critical point for this to happen
[701.40 → 707.16] we need to realize that every way we live in every part of society is shaped by some story
[707.16 → 712.32] the way you do your work the way you live with your friends the way you do your travel and leisure
[712.32 → 718.84] the way you do every piece of your life is shaped by some story and I could give tons of examples of
[718.84 → 726.60] how work is not shaped for many of us by the biblical story and Jesus when he says follow me
[726.60 → 733.80] invites us to break the cultural way that we see how these things are done and inhabit these spaces
[733.80 → 741.70] these activities as apprentices following Jesus serving god seeking first the kingdom
[741.70 → 750.32] now the church in Rome to whom this letter was written they had a very similar experience of
[750.32 → 756.36] being a small community in a big culture that lived out of a different story and I want you to imagine
[756.36 → 761.36] them for a minute again they're a little community a brand-new community in this big Roman Empire
[761.36 → 768.26] this empire was the most impressive of empires it had a very significant place in western history
[768.26 → 772.82] and there's a story that came with the Roman Empire people who grew up in this city they were
[772.82 → 778.16] forged in a certain way the same way that Canadians are forged in a certain way in our cities they had
[778.16 → 782.20] a certain vision for what a city was about a certain vision for why they worked a certain understanding
[782.20 → 788.02] of their place in society and what life was all about and everything and I do mean this everything in
[788.02 → 794.64] Roman society tailored towards this vision of Rome the games the feasts the architecture
[794.64 → 800.52] all of it was shaping they had statues all over the city telling the story of all their military victories
[800.52 → 806.78] how it was so great to be in this city of Rome how Caesar should be worshipped, and he was worshipped
[806.78 → 808.36] because he was a god
[808.36 → 813.64] this was all telling a story of what it means to be human
[813.64 → 820.44] what it means to live and enjoy the world as a good Roman citizen and in the midst of this big Roman
[820.44 → 827.62] story there's this church and these Christians happen to have heard probably through evangelism
[827.62 → 834.20] through a variety of things the message of a different king a rabbi who walked around talking
[834.20 → 840.66] about the arrival of a different kingdom who spoke about a different story about god working in a
[840.66 → 844.98] different kind of way than Romans would even understand the gods they saw this and heard
[844.98 → 849.38] about this rabbi who could heal and speak with authority teach with a different ethic on loving
[849.38 → 855.04] friends loving enemies loving neighbours and as they heard this message they were wooed by the power and
[855.04 → 862.88] authority with which it came and much to everyone's surprise this little group of people who at some
[862.88 → 869.68] point became called Christians follower of the way followers of the way of Jesus broke free from that Roman mould
[869.68 → 880.16] they saw this big powerful pervasive Roman story as a false story more than that they saw it as an enslaving
[880.16 → 890.40] story and Jesus broke into these people's lives liberating them from all of its sin and bringing them into freedom
[890.40 → 898.00] I want to pause and emphasize that for all the Christians then and Christians in every generation
[898.00 → 903.68] in every city throughout the world that process of breaking free from the idolatrous story the lies of
[903.68 → 910.08] culture the power of sin and being liberated into the family of Jesus is a slow often painful process
[911.28 → 915.92] of seeing how you've been formed in all sorts of conscious and unconscious ways to think like your
[915.92 → 921.36] culture thinks to practice and have habits like your culture has and be formed in ways that you now are trying
[921.36 → 926.80] to shift and together, and we're going to talk about this the next couple of weeks how is a community practice ways that
[926.80 → 935.04] steep and nurture one's heart and one's life in the way of the kingdom and this little Roman church they had to
[935.04 → 942.72] unlearn bad habits of worshipping a human worshipping this Caesar who would be killed and that's the end of it and they
[942.72 → 947.60] started learning how to feast in ways that honoured god in fact they had to not participate in many
[947.60 → 952.40] practices of culture because they were so violent so explicit, and they didn't learn new practices like
[952.40 → 957.68] communion where they gathered around a table to celebrate king Jesus and all that he had done and
[957.68 → 965.20] accomplished the slow process of unlearning old habits being liberated into this new family that was actually
[965.20 → 973.76] flourishing as the way god intended from the beginning and as it happened they stood out as
[973.76 → 977.92] they followed the way of Christ as they apprenticed with him, and they learned to be like him do what he
[977.92 → 982.96] did they stood out from the Roman story they didn't beat to the tune of the Roman world they didn't live
[982.96 → 988.48] the way Romans lived and people just could not figure out these Christians in fact there's a lot of writing
[988.48 → 992.80] where writers and authors of the time were trying to figure out why they live the way they live
[992.80 → 999.52] I want to read for you a quote this comes from what's called the epistle of igneous, and we don't
[999.52 → 1005.52] know who wrote it, but it was written in all likelihood to a man named igneous who is suspicious
[1005.52 → 1012.24] or at the very best exploring and trying to make sense of the Christians and I want to suggest to you
[1012.24 → 1019.76] before I read it that line by line whoever wrote this is doing incredible cultural contrast to the Roman
[1019.76 → 1024.88] story and how the Christians are living and I hope that as you hear it you'll see how it just speaks on
[1024.88 → 1031.36] so many levels to the church today this is what the epistle to igneous says they the Christians
[1031.92 → 1039.12] they dwell in their own countries but not simply or sorry but simply as sojourners as citizens they
[1039.12 → 1045.28] share in all things with others, and yet they endure all things as if foreigners they marry as do all others
[1045.28 → 1052.16] they beget children, but they do not destroy their offspring what a word and season they have a
[1052.16 → 1060.24] common table but not a common bed they are in the flesh, but they do not live after the flesh they pass
[1060.24 → 1066.56] their days on earth but are citizens of heaven they obey the prescribed laws and at the same time surpass
[1066.56 → 1074.64] the laws in their lives they love all and are persecuted by all they are poor, yet they are made many rich
[1074.64 → 1080.16] they are completely destitute, and yet they enjoy complete abundance they are reviled and yet they
[1080.16 → 1086.80] bless when they do good they are punished as evildoers undergoing punishment they rejoice because they're
[1086.80 → 1091.84] brought back to life isn't that a powerful quote
[1094.40 → 1102.56] what a statement to describe the church hey igneous you want to make sense of the church this is how they
[1102.56 → 1108.32] live and if I had more time I'd show you line by line how all the ways they lived were just running
[1108.32 → 1114.48] against the grain of Roman culture running against the grain of how people assumed you should live
[1114.48 → 1121.44] the good Roman life and here's my question you ready for it could the same kind of letter be written
[1121.44 → 1128.08] to a igneous of our day the one who's trying to make sense of the Christians in west coast British
[1128.08 → 1133.84] Columbia what would be said to them could we say things like what they're saying they live simply
[1134.72 → 1139.84] like sojourners they held their citizenship loosely because they were citizens of the kingdom
[1140.72 → 1145.52] they live simply could we say that these were the kind of people who practice a common table they
[1145.52 → 1150.48] broke bread with strangers and enemies they learned community that cut through social boundaries but they
[1150.48 → 1159.36] did not share their beds there is fidelity in the marriage covenant could we say these kinds of things
[1159.36 → 1169.60] of the church today have we stopped and thought about at a deep level what faithful non-conformity to
[1169.60 → 1177.52] our cultural patterns looks like for the church today how might the gospel be calling us to break the
[1177.52 → 1183.28] moulds that we are currently living in even unconsciously in our daily Canadian habits and
[1183.28 → 1188.08] I'll just ask a few questions that I hope prompt for conversation around your lunchroom table this
[1188.08 → 1193.76] afternoon or dinner table and I do invite you to have further conversation as families and couples
[1193.76 → 1201.76] and friends over what I'm about to ask how might the gospel just for starters how might apprenticing with Jesus
[1201.76 → 1211.44] change the way you interact with social media how many change the way it shapes you if it's true that
[1211.44 → 1217.60] most of us spend upwards of 20 hours on social media each week how might an apprentice of Jesus use
[1218.48 → 1225.68] and sort of renew the way these mediums and mediae are used what does it look like for you is it a habit
[1225.68 → 1231.20] that's forging you in a certain way and how than as the apprentice do you faithfully engage with these media
[1232.08 → 1239.76] or how might as an apprentice of Jesus you live in the academic world I am so convinced that the
[1239.76 → 1245.12] academic world is such a powerful apprenticing community and as students go to school and
[1245.12 → 1251.84] university how are we resisting the message of making your job first about just what you want to
[1251.84 → 1257.44] do how you can get a lot of money and live a comfortable life how do we make our academic life about
[1257.44 → 1264.40] growing our gifts serving the community and not first and foremost being preoccupied with money
[1265.52 → 1271.52] how are you apprenticing with Jesus and resisting the cultural mould in the academic world
[1272.80 → 1278.32] or your work life let's talk about that I'm convinced that most of us when we walk into workplaces
[1278.32 → 1282.24] we're walking into a culture that's going to form us in a certain way and I don't know everyone's
[1282.24 → 1286.08] workplace but I know enough of our workplaces to know that there's sort of the corporate ladder
[1286.08 → 1291.84] there's the way in which you got to navigate the politics so you can be on top how might you as an
[1291.84 → 1299.20] apprentice break that mould and be someone who seeks to serve the kingdom of god and bless and love one's
[1299.20 → 1308.48] neighbour through that vocation how do we apprentice in our workplaces or how might we apprentice with Jesus
[1308.48 → 1315.28] in our singleness in our marriage I'm struck by some of the comments that are made in this epistle to
[1315.28 → 1321.68] igneous and how prophetic they speak now to the church today where now if you want to live any way
[1321.68 → 1327.20] you want in your sexual life that's for you to decide there is no authority above you, you are the centre
[1327.20 → 1334.40] in our culture how might the apprentice of Jesus who gives us the way of life live singly live in
[1334.40 → 1341.04] a marriage relationship and honour god's creational design for these institutions and relationships
[1342.88 → 1347.12] jams k smith who wrote a book called you are what you love which is a summary of a more complicated
[1347.12 → 1353.12] book he says that families should be having audits of their family life where you sort of walk through
[1353.12 → 1357.04] your weekly habits your monthly habits and just ask the question of how am I being formed
[1357.20 → 1363.04] by these habits like what is my 30 hours of Netflix doing to my soul how is it shaping my desires what
[1363.04 → 1368.24] vision of the human life is it giving me and someone just recently by the way described to me how Netflix
[1368.24 → 1372.56] for them is a Trojan horse it's always a story that you like and then at some point it becomes this
[1372.56 → 1377.92] cultural hijacking saying hey here's here are the priorities we want you to have as an individual western
[1377.92 → 1384.88] in person here's what really matters to us how do we apprentice with Jesus in those places with these
[1384.88 → 1391.92] habits and what might faithful non-conformity look like I'm convinced we need to have more conversations
[1391.92 → 1397.44] not just as families not just as couples but as a church saying what does it look like for us to live
[1397.44 → 1407.68] and practice new things new ways as followers of Jesus now to return to where I began pastor stood
[1407.68 → 1414.24] made that audacious comment that he without the gospel story would be a slave and I want to say
[1414.24 → 1420.32] differently now whenever Jesus calls us into non-conformity with idolatrous cultural patterns he is inviting us to
[1420.32 → 1425.84] life there is this I think very false narrative that to become a Christian is to say no to all the
[1425.84 → 1430.48] good things in life you sort of stay home while everyone's having the party and that is the opposite
[1430.48 → 1437.12] of what's happening when Jesus invites us to follow him what's really happening is the lord of life is
[1437.12 → 1443.60] saying you will be destroyed by the idols of this culture in one way or another you'll be enslaved in
[1443.60 → 1448.56] ways you won't even be able to see and I'm inviting you to the life to the full
[1451.28 → 1458.16] and what's really happening in our culture is false offers of salvation a false story even every
[1458.16 → 1462.32] commercial I watch I'm so surprised at how often there's this implicit sometimes just straight up
[1462.32 → 1469.04] explicit offer of the good life through this purchase this lifestyle this thing this relationship
[1469.04 → 1473.92] I want to read a quote for you that we're reading in surge this comes from a book called the symphony
[1473.92 → 1479.44] of mission by mike green and Jim Mullins and Jim Mullins wrote this part and I just find this to
[1479.44 → 1486.56] sing very powerfully he writes culturally we've sought salvation in technologies that have certainly
[1486.56 → 1492.00] benefited the world but have never fulfilled their promises often they've simply made new and bigger
[1492.00 → 1498.08] problems nuclear fission brings heat to cold homes but also the threat of a nuclear winter
[1498.08 → 1505.28] the internet promises to bring us together, but it makes the world a lonely people who spend more
[1505.28 → 1510.88] time looking at glowing rectangles than in the faces of other people in an attempt to solve the
[1510.88 → 1514.72] mystery of the world's brokenness we've also established political and economic systems like
[1514.72 → 1521.44] communism socialism and capitalism along with many other failed isms that promise freedom but leave us
[1521.44 → 1528.32] as slaves even modern day health fads you ready for this hope even modern day health fads are an attempt
[1528.32 → 1534.00] to solve the mystery of brokenness, but essential oils aren't potent enough to cover the stench of sin
[1534.72 → 1540.88] veganism will never find enough kale to cover our shame sorry to the kale lovers a paleo diet cannot
[1540.88 → 1547.12] restore us to the original human condition CrossFit cannot make us strong enough to carry the weight of
[1547.12 → 1553.84] the world's brokenness our world is marked by a brutal and comprehensive brokenness we are spiritually
[1553.84 → 1559.60] cut off from god socially separated from one another physically alienated from the flourishing we were
[1559.60 → 1566.56] intended to experience from the beginning that's the issue and what culture is doing in so many deceptive
[1566.56 → 1571.84] false ways saying here's where you find salvation this purchase this relationship this social media this
[1571.84 → 1577.68] number of followers this self-determined identity and Jesus when he invites us to follow him as an
[1577.68 → 1587.12] apprentice he's saying that is slavery let me show you the real problem and let me liberate you in the deepest
[1587.12 → 1597.28] possible way the problem is sin and I want to return at the end of my sermon to where Paul begins in this
[1597.28 → 1606.64] passage how does Paul start he says therefore brothers and sisters in view of god's mercy all the
[1606.64 → 1611.04] commands all the urging Paul makes about breaking the cultural mould about being transformed by the
[1611.04 → 1617.12] renewing of our minds it all hinges on what in the world he means when he says in view of god's mercy
[1618.80 → 1626.16] and he writes in his commentary on this passage he says Christian living never begins with a set of rules
[1626.16 → 1631.20] though it contains them though it contains them as it goes forward it begins glad self-offering of one's
[1631.20 → 1641.04] whole self to god whose mercy has come all the way to meet us in our rebellion in our sin and death
[1642.72 → 1650.56] while we were still sinners' god in his mercy through the work of Jesus Christ liberated us from the power of sin
[1650.56 → 1655.60] and death and Satan
[1656.00 → 1660.48] two or three weeks ago Britney and I sat down, and we watched the lion the witch and the wardrobe I don't
[1660.48 → 1663.68] know if you've seen that, but it's a good movie not as good as the book but still a good movie
[1664.48 → 1668.16] and I have a favourite scene and I've seen this movie twice now and both times it's the one that
[1668.16 → 1673.36] kind of gets the hair on my arms kind of lifting, and it's right after Asian he's put on the stone
[1673.36 → 1678.24] tablet he's killed by the queen and the stone tablet breaks and Asian is now resurrected, and he's
[1678.24 → 1681.84] running, but he doesn't run to the battle you know the story there's a battle happening, and it's not
[1681.84 → 1687.92] looking good for humanity but Asian runs to a different place he runs to the castle where the
[1687.92 → 1693.36] queen is, and he runs into the area where there are hundreds of frozen animals under the spell of that
[1693.36 → 1702.24] queen and what he does is breathe on these animals and this ice melts away, and they slowly come alive and
[1702.24 → 1710.80] they see him and the beautiful thing in that scene is they look in the face of the person the animal who
[1710.80 → 1720.32] has already defeated the queen and in the same way as Christ by his power breathes life into us by the spirit
[1721.12 → 1729.04] as we follow him we're following the one who's already defeated the power of sin he has already defeated
[1729.04 → 1735.44] Satan by the cross he's already risen victoriously over the grave, and we stand in his power by his
[1735.44 → 1743.04] authority by his spirit as free people who stand behind the one who's already won the victory and the
[1743.04 → 1749.28] goal of our life is to live in the freedom he's already provided us by way of his death and his resurrection
[1749.28 → 1760.48] when Jesus invites us to follow him he invites us into liberation from the power of sin the idols of
[1760.48 → 1769.04] culture and the false stories do you know what you've been invited into and do you know what you are being
[1769.04 → 1777.84] pulled out of you know one of my prayers for our church is that we get to encounter the diabetes of today
[1778.56 → 1784.24] that there are serious people asking perfect questions about what the church is for why the
[1784.24 → 1790.08] church exists why they don't seem to fit the mould of Canadian society I hope that our church has many
[1790.08 → 1795.20] opportunities where people say you just don't fit in here what's the deal with you, and you have the
[1795.20 → 1801.76] chance to say let me tell you about the one who has liberated us from the power of sin
[1801.76 → 1808.32] and the freedom I found in the gospel of Jesus Christ let's pray
[1812.00 → 1817.68] father we thank you for your word we thank you that you have found us all the way
[1817.68 → 1825.20] thank you for defeating the power of sin for rising victorious from the grave thank you for being
[1825.20 → 1829.04] the one who rules the world even at this moment and giving us your Holy Spirit
[1829.04 → 1837.28] lord we pray that by your strength we would break from the cultural mould
[1838.48 → 1845.44] we pray that we would be faithful apprentices, and we pray lord even this week we would learn how to
[1845.44 → 1854.00] step into the freedom you have given us fill us with your spirit walk before us in your strength we ask amen
[1854.00 → 1861.52] this morning as Jonathan already mentioned we are going to celebrate communion together and I was
[1861.52 → 1865.76] told last time I led communion that I went way too fast into it and sometimes especially our young
[1865.76 → 1870.40] families need a few minutes so what I'm going to do is I'm going to allow the worship team to just
[1870.40 → 1876.40] play music and I invite you to get the elements ready in your living room to spend time praying you want
[1876.40 → 1880.72] to spend some time just preparing for this meal and then I will lead us through the lord's supper
[1884.64 → 1895.04] um
[1895.20 → 1895.92] too
[1895.92 → 1905.92] uh
[1914.00 → 1916.00] Amen.
[1944.00 → 1946.00] Amen.
[1974.00 → 1976.00] Amen.
[2000.00 → 2001.86] Every city,
[2002.54 → 2003.36] every community,
[2004.00 → 2004.76] throughout history,
[2005.76 → 2007.02] has always found ways
[2007.02 → 2007.98] to form people
[2007.98 → 2009.54] through feasts and celebrations.
[2010.72 → 2011.56] It's found ways
[2011.56 → 2012.64] to sort of pull away
[2012.64 → 2014.04] and gather together
[2014.04 → 2015.12] to celebrate a meal
[2015.12 → 2015.60] that says,
[2015.82 → 2016.64] this is who you are.
[2017.66 → 2018.68] And throughout the centuries,
[2019.00 → 2019.50] the church,
[2019.76 → 2021.34] after Jesus' ascension,
[2021.84 → 2023.74] has taken this meal
[2023.74 → 2024.18] and says,
[2024.30 → 2025.10] this is the meal.
[2025.70 → 2026.74] This is the feast.
[2026.94 → 2027.90] This is the celebration
[2027.90 → 2029.76] that says who we are.
[2030.46 → 2032.60] Our identity is in Jesus Christ,
[2032.60 → 2034.80] whose body and blood
[2034.80 → 2036.32] was given for us.
[2036.72 → 2037.54] And in him,
[2037.72 → 2038.56] we have life,
[2039.06 → 2040.16] and he is the head
[2040.16 → 2040.78] of the body.
[2042.30 → 2042.96] And so hope,
[2043.14 → 2043.84] it is my privilege
[2043.84 → 2044.52] to lead us
[2044.52 → 2046.20] as the body scattered
[2046.20 → 2047.00] throughout the city
[2047.00 → 2047.68] this morning
[2047.68 → 2048.90] in this meal
[2048.90 → 2050.54] that forms our identity,
[2051.14 → 2051.86] in this feast
[2051.86 → 2052.66] that tells us
[2052.66 → 2053.42] who we are.
[2054.22 → 2055.16] And as we begin,
[2055.32 → 2056.56] I want to read words
[2056.56 → 2057.58] from Galatians 2,
[2057.64 → 2058.72] and I'll pluralize them
[2058.72 → 2059.34] for the body.
[2060.06 → 2061.70] We have been crucified
[2061.70 → 2062.54] with Christ.
[2063.02 → 2063.96] It's no longer us
[2063.96 → 2064.40] who live,
[2064.48 → 2065.54] but Christ who lives
[2065.54 → 2066.26] in us.
[2066.60 → 2068.12] The life we now live,
[2068.64 → 2069.68] we live by faith
[2069.68 → 2070.58] in the Son of God
[2070.58 → 2071.88] who lives
[2071.88 → 2073.60] and gave himself up
[2073.60 → 2074.66] for us.
[2076.84 → 2077.74] Brothers and sisters,
[2077.84 → 2078.22] on the night
[2078.22 → 2079.26] Jesus was betrayed,
[2080.68 → 2081.96] he took bread.
[2081.96 → 2085.94] And after he'd given thanks,
[2086.00 → 2086.48] he broke it,
[2086.50 → 2087.72] and he said to his disciples,
[2087.98 → 2088.90] this is my body.
[2089.58 → 2090.28] Do this
[2090.28 → 2091.50] in remembrance of me.
[2093.04 → 2093.86] The same way,
[2093.92 → 2094.68] he took the cup,
[2095.62 → 2096.82] and after he'd poured it
[2096.82 → 2097.46] and gave thanks,
[2097.52 → 2097.82] he said,
[2097.90 → 2098.60] this is the cup
[2098.60 → 2099.54] of the new covenant.
[2100.50 → 2101.96] My blood poured out
[2101.96 → 2102.40] for many.
[2103.40 → 2104.10] Do this
[2104.10 → 2105.80] in remembrance of me.
[2107.70 → 2109.50] As Paul encourages
[2109.50 → 2110.00] the church,
[2110.14 → 2111.20] whenever we eat
[2111.20 → 2111.82] this bread,
[2112.86 → 2113.48] and whenever we,
[2113.64 → 2114.46] as followers of Jesus,
[2114.66 → 2115.44] drink this cup,
[2115.60 → 2116.42] we proclaim
[2116.42 → 2118.38] the death of Jesus
[2118.38 → 2119.58] until he comes again.
[2120.90 → 2121.52] And so,
[2121.72 → 2122.54] I invite you,
[2123.22 → 2123.98] to those of us
[2123.98 → 2124.60] who believe
[2124.60 → 2125.64] that Jesus is
[2125.64 → 2126.52] Lord, Saviour,
[2126.64 → 2127.04] and King,
[2127.68 → 2128.88] I invite you to take,
[2129.72 → 2130.00] eat,
[2130.72 → 2131.10] drink,
[2131.76 → 2132.18] remember,
[2132.46 → 2133.14] and believe
[2133.14 → 2134.18] that the body
[2134.18 → 2135.30] and blood of Christ
[2135.30 → 2135.82] was given
[2135.82 → 2136.92] for the complete
[2136.92 → 2137.74] forgiveness
[2137.74 → 2139.66] of all our sins.
[2141.96 → 2143.54] John Nielsen and
[2143.54 → 2145.48] another,
[2145.68 → 2146.80] the Ä...
[2149.22 → 2149.84] ahead
[2156.10 → 2158.58] and the
[2158.58 → 2159.78] mother
[2159.78 → 2159.80] Gibbs
[2159.80 → 2160.74] into this
[2160.74 → 2160.80] room.
[2160.80 → 2190.78] Thank you.
[2190.80 → 2220.78] Thank you.
[2220.80 → 2225.02] And that second verse in the song is really that verse of dedication.
[2225.26 → 2231.80] All of our ambitions, all of our hopes, all of our dreams, we surrender them to your plan.
[2232.38 → 2236.98] So let's spend some more time in prayer, dedicating our lives, praying through how God is speaking to us.
[2237.02 → 2238.62] And then we'll finish by singing together.
[2238.62 → 2240.62] Thank you.
[2240.62 → 2241.62] Thank you.
[2241.62 → 2242.62] Thank you.
[2242.62 → 2243.62] Thank you.
