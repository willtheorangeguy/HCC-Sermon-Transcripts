[0.00 → 29.98] We'll be right back.
[30.00 → 59.98] We'll be right back.
[60.00 → 89.98] We'll be right back.
[90.00 → 93.60] We do encourage you to give generously to the ministries of our church, one of which,
[93.70 → 97.74] which is ongoing, is a water project in northern indigenous communities.
[98.02 → 102.08] One of the ways that we saw as a fitting response to all that's happening in their communities
[102.08 → 104.00] is getting behind a clean water project.
[104.10 → 106.22] So if that's something you want to give to, you'll see it as one of the options.
[106.22 → 107.36] Let's give generously.
[107.36 → 109.36] Let's give generously.
[109.36 → 111.36] Let's give generously.
[111.36 → 115.36] Let's give generously.
[115.36 → 119.24] Let's give generously.
[119.24 → 149.22] Thank you.
[149.24 → 179.22] Thank you.
[179.24 → 209.22] Thank you.
[209.24 → 211.48] We'll read the first 17 verses.
[211.48 → 221.70] And God spoke all of these words.
[241.48 → 271.48] 
[271.48 → 301.48] 
[301.48 → 330.34] So far the reading of God's word.
[330.34 → 360.32] Thank you.
[360.34 → 362.34] Thank you.
[362.34 → 364.34] Thank you.
[364.34 → 366.34] Thank you.
[366.34 → 396.34] 
[396.34 → 426.34] 
[426.34 → 428.34] Thank you.
[428.34 → 430.34] Thank you.
[430.34 → 432.34] Thank you.
[432.34 → 434.34] Thank you.
[434.34 → 436.34] Thank you.
[436.34 → 438.34] Thank you.
[438.34 → 440.34] Thank you.
[440.34 → 442.34] Thank you.
[442.34 → 444.34] Thank you.
[444.34 → 446.34] Thank you.
[446.34 → 448.34] Thank you.
[448.34 → 450.34] Thank you.
[450.34 → 452.34] Thank you.
[452.34 → 454.34] Thank you.
[454.34 → 456.34] Thank you.
[456.34 → 458.34] Thank you.
[458.34 → 460.34] Thank you.
[460.34 → 462.34] Thank you.
[462.34 → 464.34] Thank you.
[464.34 → 466.34] Thank you.
[466.34 → 468.34] Thank you.
[468.34 → 470.34] Thank you.
[470.34 → 472.34] Thank you.
[472.34 → 474.34] I'm sorry.
[474.34 → 477.70] to church for the first time in a while, you hear me reading this passage, and you think,
[477.80 → 483.50] well, there it is. You shall not. You shall not. Furthermore, you shall not. There it is, the restrictive faith
[483.50 → 489.48] that you thought Christianity was. But I hope as we walk through this passage this morning,
[489.98 → 496.70] you will see these 10 instructions, not as restraining good, but protecting the flourishing
[496.70 → 503.92] life. That you'll see behind every one of God's restrictions, His nose, is a protecting of the
[503.92 → 509.62] beauty of the human life. That's what we're going to do this morning. We're unpacking that together.
[510.84 → 514.98] Now, one of the mistakes we can make when we read the 10 commandments is to take them out of their
[514.98 → 519.78] context, sort of extract them from the time in which they were given. These commands were given
[519.78 → 524.96] to a particular people, Israel, at a particular time, coming out of a particular context, and that is
[524.96 → 531.50] slavery. For four centuries, not just a few days, but for four centuries, all Israel knew were Egyptian
[531.50 → 538.12] gods, Egyptian ways of life, and Egyptian laws. And we know two of those laws, by the way. Two of the
[538.12 → 542.40] decrees that the people in Egypt lived by. You know what they were? Israel gets to be our slaves.
[543.06 → 546.60] We're going to oppress them brutally, and they're going to build up our cities. And number two,
[546.78 → 551.36] we're going to destroy Israel's future by murdering their babies. Those are two of the Egyptian laws.
[552.82 → 557.48] And God rescues Israel, the slave nation crying out in oppression. He brings them to himself at
[557.48 → 564.74] Mount Sinai, and he says, I am not Pharaoh. These are my instructions. This is how you're going to
[564.74 → 571.38] organize your society. And if you obey, if you keep these instructions, you're going to experience
[571.38 → 577.70] blessing. Your community is going to flourish. And not only that, the nations are going to see it
[577.70 → 584.94] and be drawn in by it. Remember, Israel is sent to live out the law as a way of bringing blessing
[584.94 → 591.56] to the nations. So this morning, I'm going to open up three particular ways that this law is good for
[591.56 → 595.38] God's people, and it's good for the nations. And the first, I've already mentioned, that it leads
[595.38 → 601.66] to the flourishing of human life. Yes, it's true. God says no a lot in this passage. You shall not.
[601.92 → 606.10] But like a good parent, and I think that's a good frame, like a good parent who loves their child,
[606.46 → 612.24] he blocks out and put fences around that which brings destruction. You know, we have a number of
[612.24 → 618.24] friends who, over the last few months, have given cell phones to their teenagers. And these parents
[618.24 → 621.24] are wise parents. We're taking note for these parents because one day that's going to come
[621.24 → 627.62] for us when our kids turn 35, and we're going to give them cell phones. But these parents wisely
[627.62 → 632.94] knew that when they hand over this piece of technology, it is not a neutral device. There
[632.94 → 639.76] are risks in territory with cell phones, and so they wisely say, here are the rules. Number one,
[639.76 → 644.56] no cell phone at the table. It's one we've heard. Another rule, this cell phone does not go in your
[644.56 → 650.58] bedroom by yourself. Number three, we can check your phone at any time. And my favourite, which I know
[650.58 → 656.26] someone in this church gave, we can change the rules at any time if we see that these rules aren't
[656.26 → 661.78] working for your good. Now, here's the question. Are those parents being cruel? Teenagers?
[661.78 → 670.46] Silence. The answer is absolutely not. And these parents don't give rules because they're enjoying
[670.46 → 675.08] just making capricious, unnecessary rules around phones. They know the risk. And they know that
[675.08 → 679.90] just handing a phone over saying, hey, have at her, do what you want to do, is not going to lead to good.
[680.66 → 685.80] In fact, some of the greatest challenges, and I've said this before, that come into our teenagers' lives
[685.80 → 693.92] come through phones. And here's why I want to name a pernicious lie that we live with in the West.
[694.22 → 701.18] And here it is. Freedom is the ability to do whatever you want. You want to do this on your phone?
[701.24 → 704.20] You go for it. You want to live that way with your sexuality? You go for it. Furthermore, you want to do this with
[704.20 → 708.28] your life? You go for it. Furthermore, you do whatever you want to do. That's your freedom. That's your prerogative.
[708.28 → 715.86] You enjoy it. That's freedom in the West. And here's my question. Has that led to a better,
[716.68 → 724.00] healthier society? Are we happier? Are relationships better? Are families safer in this city as a result
[724.00 → 729.54] of this kind of freedom? That's an important question. Has the freedom that we so enjoy and
[729.54 → 736.28] talk about in the West, is it actually leading to a flourishing society? You know what therapists will
[736.28 → 743.30] tell you? Absolutely not. In fact, what therapists and counsellors so often do when they meet with
[743.30 → 747.26] people, they say, tell me about the patterns you have in life. What are the practices you have in
[747.26 → 751.60] life? And they realize so many of the things we're deciding to do, so many of the freedoms we're
[751.60 → 757.08] enjoying are leading to our destruction. Let me read a quote for you. This comes from John Tyson. He's a
[757.08 → 762.52] pastor in New York. And this is, I think, a really intriguing quote about the way we think about
[762.52 → 768.38] freedom. He writes, although our culture would tell us that we are free and that the best way to
[768.38 → 773.86] express ourselves is by satisfying our various cravings, whatever they may be, this promise has
[773.86 → 782.56] proven hollow, deceptive, and disappointing. If anything, we seem to be increasingly, here's the word,
[782.88 → 790.12] enslaved by the practices that are promising freedom. You ever experienced that? If we are free
[790.12 → 795.10] on the outside, why are we so enslaved on the inside?
[798.74 → 803.10] Darrell Johnson in his work on the Ten Commandments has said, when we look at all the restrictions
[803.10 → 809.04] God places around his community, we need to be asking, what is our loving Father protecting
[809.04 → 816.94] and enhancing with every one of these rules? Or as a different commentator put it, the Ten Commandments
[816.94 → 823.08] are not an imposition on human life. They're not imposing something on us that's unhealthy. They are an
[823.08 → 828.24] exposition of human life. You know what he means by that? That the person who gives the law is also our
[828.24 → 834.02] creator. The person who says, you shall not do this, is the one who knows this is how life works best. He's the
[834.02 → 839.28] one who designed relationships, who designed community, who designed marriage and family. He knows how it's
[839.28 → 844.48] supposed to go. And in these instructions, he's saying, don't do this. It's going to hurt. It's
[844.48 → 850.96] going to bring pain. Do this. It's going to lead to your life and blessing and flourishing together
[850.96 → 856.66] in community. And so let's just tease that out a little bit, how, you know, God is showing his
[856.66 → 860.58] protecting and his loving care in each of these commands. I'll just give you a few examples.
[860.58 → 870.52] So the very first command, you shall not have any gods before me. Now some of them said, wow, that's
[870.52 → 875.96] kind of strange statement. It almost feels like a selfish God who needs to have all the approval or
[875.96 → 881.18] the worship of people. Why would God give this command as the first statement? Why would he do
[881.18 → 890.26] that? The answer is, you were created for worshipping God. You and I, all of us, every person who's ever
[890.26 → 896.38] lived was created to be in close, intimate communion with our heavenly father, to know him and be known
[896.38 → 901.96] by him, to live with him, to hear from him. That's what we were created for. And so God says, live how
[901.96 → 908.92] you were created. And here's the flip side of that. If we worship other gods that are not the living God,
[908.98 → 915.36] that can't save us, can't help us, can't speak to us, they're going to fail us. Don't you think?
[915.36 → 920.74] And by saying, don't have other gods, God is basically saying, don't walk down the path of
[920.74 → 926.66] false worship that's going to lead to pain and destruction in your life. They can't save you.
[927.16 → 931.98] They can't speak to you. They can't carry you in the way that God carries Israel. They are going to
[931.98 → 938.78] lead to pain. So don't worship them. Don't follow them. Don't organize the whole of your life around
[938.78 → 943.78] them. If I had more time, I'd just show you example after example of how when you organize your life
[943.78 → 949.86] around money. You start using people, and they become a means to another end. And you're never
[949.86 → 955.18] content with what you have. You organize your life around your sexuality. You'll reduce what it means
[955.18 → 960.26] to be human, and it will lead to pain. You organize your life around the approval of your friends.
[960.68 → 965.68] Oh man, will that lead to pain? Especially if you're obsessed with your looks and you get older.
[967.26 → 973.16] False worship, other gods lead to our demise. That's the first. And so God's protecting us with the
[973.16 → 977.80] first command. Let's look at the fourth command. This is an interesting one. Remember the Sabbath
[977.80 → 983.46] day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labour and do all your work. But on the seventh day,
[983.54 → 989.66] it's a Sabbath day to the Lord your God. On it, you shall not do any work. Now I think this is a
[989.66 → 994.00] fascinating command in part because if I were to ask you without thinking too much about these
[994.00 → 999.10] commands, if you were to give 10 rules to organize society, I bet you 10 bucks you wouldn't think
[999.10 → 1004.42] that rest should be one of the commands. Would you think of it? I'm not sure if I would think of it.
[1005.18 → 1010.60] But think of the context. Four centuries of slavery. God rescues this little slave nation,
[1010.72 → 1018.68] brings them to himself at Mount Sinai, and he says, you were created to work, and you were created to rest.
[1019.86 → 1025.06] I'm not Pharaoh. You're not created for endless work, nor are you created for endless rest.
[1025.06 → 1030.96] Six plus one is what you were designed for. And so this Sabbath command goes right back to the way
[1030.96 → 1037.72] we were created to work and to rest. Six plus one, not five plus two, not four plus three, six plus
[1037.72 → 1041.98] one. And I think in the West we need to emphasize the other side. We don't live in a slave nation.
[1044.30 → 1048.70] And for me, I actually had an image in my head as I was working on this sermon and thinking about
[1048.70 → 1054.76] this particular law. I pictured pregnant women at the base of Mount Sinai. And I pictured Moses coming
[1054.76 → 1059.70] back and sharing God's laws as God, their new Lord, and saying what he wants for the people.
[1060.24 → 1064.64] And I picture these pregnant women weeping in joy because number one, their kids get to live.
[1064.96 → 1073.02] No more murdering babies. But number two, their kids get to rest. Not endless slavery. And here again,
[1073.14 → 1079.96] we see the character of God. I'm good. I'm not Pharaoh. Furthermore, I'm not a slave driver. Furthermore, I am for you.
[1079.96 → 1086.38] And my command for you is work and rest. My brother-in-law, Mark Glanville, in a study in
[1086.38 → 1091.86] Exodus, he points out how the people who gain the most in God's instruction, the people who gain to
[1091.86 → 1098.12] be protected and taken care of in the best way are actually the poor and the vulnerable. Contra laws
[1098.12 → 1102.60] of Pharaoh and many laws of nations today, God's instruction actually has a special interest in
[1102.60 → 1108.92] making sure that the poorest and the most vulnerable and the weak are protected. And this Sabbath law is just
[1108.92 → 1115.38] one of those laws that say, I am not Pharaoh. My laws are just, and they are how I created you to live.
[1116.68 → 1121.88] The seventh command, do not commit adultery. I thought I'd highlight this one in part because
[1121.88 → 1127.28] in our culture, for the first time in a long time, adultery is a normalized thing. In fact, in many of the
[1127.28 → 1131.34] shows you and I watch, I don't know if you've noticed this, it's almost something that the way they've
[1131.34 → 1136.74] written the script is that you expect it to happen. You almost want it to happen. Why would God say,
[1136.74 → 1142.28] do not commit adultery? Well, God created marriage, and God created to be a bond between husband and wife
[1142.28 → 1147.10] that is safe, that is intimate, that is protected, a place where kids can grow up in loving harmony with
[1147.10 → 1154.74] parents. Do not commit adultery. And no one needs to be told the pain and destruction and division that ripples
[1154.74 → 1161.12] through a whole community, not just a family, but a whole community with adultery. Are you seeing the trend, Hope?
[1161.12 → 1168.18] Every one of the rules God gives is for His people. It's for His community. It's for their health,
[1168.28 → 1176.26] their safety, their shalom, their peace. Dishonouring parents disrupts the family. False testimony ruins
[1176.26 → 1183.72] friendships. Think of the way in which all of these things, murder, destroys, unravels community. God
[1183.72 → 1191.78] puts fences around to safeguard blessing. And if Israel lives in obedience, they will experience
[1191.78 → 1200.04] that blessing. It's not surprising then that in Psalm 19, when the psalmist starts talking about
[1200.04 → 1204.22] the law, it's not some restrictive thing. It's not some frustrating thing that's imposed on their
[1204.22 → 1207.76] community. In fact, if you look through the psalms over and over again, you hear the psalmist saying
[1207.76 → 1213.20] things like, the law of the Lord is perfect. It's refreshing the soul. These precepts of God are right,
[1213.30 → 1218.48] giving joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes. They're more
[1218.48 → 1226.30] precious than gold. That's how they talk about the law, more precious than gold. The law leads to the
[1226.30 → 1231.18] flourishing of life. That's the first point. Secondly, and I'm not going to take as long on this one, the law
[1231.18 → 1237.48] reflects God's own character. In a very real sense, the law is a self-portrait of God. When He invites us to not
[1237.48 → 1243.44] give false testimony, He invites us to mirror His truth-speaking character. God will not bear false
[1243.44 → 1249.00] testimony, right? When God invites us to fidelity and not commit adultery, He's inviting us to reflect
[1249.00 → 1254.84] His own fidelity to His people and His own faithful character. Over and over again, as we obey these
[1254.84 → 1262.36] laws, we're mirroring and being good image bearers of God Himself. And He is good, He's compassionate,
[1262.36 → 1271.48] He's just, He's truthful, He's God. You know, just think of the gift you are to others when you speak
[1271.48 → 1278.58] the truth. And you are known as someone who will not bend it, who will not selfishly make it about you,
[1278.80 → 1284.32] but you are trustworthy and your word carries weight. Think of the gift you are to them. You're
[1284.32 → 1291.54] being like God to them. Think of the gift you are to people when you can appreciate and love them and
[1291.54 → 1298.04] their life and all that's going on in it without coveting it. Think of the gift you are to your
[1298.04 → 1305.28] parents when you listen to their instructions, and you live well with them in your home, recognizing that
[1305.28 → 1310.40] God placed them, parents did not pay me to say this, children, that God placed you under their care
[1310.40 → 1318.58] to know, serve, and love Him. As we obey these instructions, we mirror God's own good character.
[1318.70 → 1324.80] We are doing unto others as God does unto us. The law reflects His character. And finally,
[1325.12 → 1328.82] we mentioned this last week, and I'll say it again this week, the law is not just for Israel's good,
[1329.06 → 1335.14] it's for the nation's good. As Israel obeys them, as they live in them, as they honour what God says to
[1335.14 → 1340.24] them, and they organize their society around these instructions, the blessing flows not just to
[1340.24 → 1347.28] them, but through them. Maybe this example will give you some insight on how this works. A few
[1347.28 → 1353.40] years ago, I read some biography on Dietrich Bonhoeffer. If you've been around home for a
[1353.40 → 1356.48] while, you know I used to quote him excessively. Then someone said, you're quoting him too much,
[1356.52 → 1361.94] so I pulled it back. But Dietrich Bonhoeffer had a friend named Otto Dudzsasz, and Otto Dudzsasz was a
[1361.94 → 1365.80] friend who grew up with Dietrich, and he grew up going to his house all the time. He describes the
[1365.80 → 1372.86] Bonhoeffer home as a place with very clear rules. Then he says it was a place of life.
[1373.80 → 1376.98] It was a place where they shared meals together, they had discussions later in the night, they often
[1376.98 → 1381.14] played piano and danced in the living room. It was a place where all of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's friends
[1381.14 → 1385.50] would come over, and even after Bonhoeffer went off to university, these friends who still lived in
[1385.50 → 1390.98] town went over to the house and hung out with his parents. How cool are they? Think about that.
[1390.98 → 1396.42] But you see the thing that's going on there. This home, which has a very clear way of living,
[1396.52 → 1402.78] a very set plan for how this family communicates and lives, was a magnet to the friends of Bonhoeffer.
[1403.28 → 1409.68] They loved being in that place. It was a place of life. That's God's vision for Israel in the
[1409.68 → 1415.04] ancient Near East, that this place was so alive, it was so safe, it was good, it cared for the poor,
[1415.04 → 1421.32] that the nations were drawn in saying, wow, look at those laws. We need those for our homes in our
[1421.32 → 1428.46] cities around Israel. So this is the point in the sermon where I want to pause and ask,
[1429.10 → 1434.14] what do we need to hear as 21st century believers living here in Clayton Heights,
[1434.74 → 1438.66] listening into God's instruction to Israel in the Ten Commandments?
[1438.66 → 1446.82] The first thing I think we need to know is that the law still matters. There is a narrative among
[1446.82 → 1450.28] Christians today that says, well, we're New Testament believers, we'll follow Jesus, we don't
[1450.28 → 1453.74] need these Old Testament laws, these archaic rituals that happen in the book of Exodus.
[1454.56 → 1459.92] And I understand some of that logic, but I just want to say, like, Jesus cares deeply about the law.
[1460.92 → 1467.08] Jesus is very serious about the law. In fact, there's a time in Matthew's Gospel where Jesus goes up
[1467.08 → 1470.78] on a mountainside, and he starts teaching the people. And what is he teaching them?
[1471.80 → 1477.20] The law. He's going through the Ten Commandments and Jesus is saying, I haven't come to abolish it,
[1478.06 → 1482.78] I've come to fulfill it. And we do well to ask, well, what does that mean, to fulfill the law?
[1483.16 → 1488.36] And I agree with one writer who says, when Jesus fulfills the law, he's drawing out its deepest intention
[1488.36 → 1495.66] and its deepest meaning. And that's why Jesus will say, you have heard it said, but I say to you.
[1495.66 → 1500.72] You have tried to take it in this direction, but let me tell you its deepest meaning and intention.
[1500.96 → 1505.30] And I don't know if you want to hear this or not, but Jesus actually elevates the significance and he
[1505.30 → 1510.06] elevates the need for obedience. You know, he finds the loopholes that people found for all sorts of stuff.
[1510.10 → 1514.32] He says, no, no, no, that's not what the law was about. We actually want to honour this more closely
[1514.32 → 1520.14] and recognize its intention. In fact, Jesus even goes deeper. He says, the law is this, but it's not good enough
[1520.14 → 1524.72] for me that you just don't kill someone. I want you to learn how to forgive someone.
[1525.60 → 1528.88] I want you to learn how to live at peace with your brothers and sisters with whom you have conflict.
[1529.00 → 1533.58] I want you to deal with your anger. Or it's not just good enough to not commit adultery.
[1533.80 → 1540.34] I want you to deal with the lust that leads to adultery. And for us, that has a close eye on our digital lives
[1540.34 → 1541.52] to go back to our cell phones.
[1541.52 → 1549.94] And when I see Jesus giving this law, in my mind, I actually imagine someone hearing Jesus giving the law
[1549.94 → 1553.30] in the Sermon on the Mount and Gospel of Matthew and almost being frustrated.
[1554.00 → 1558.32] And they're frustrated because they know Israel's story. They're thinking perhaps to themselves,
[1558.60 → 1562.74] why are you doing this, Jesus? You're elevating obedience to the law. You're making it harder
[1562.74 → 1567.22] instead. You're going after the intention. Israel couldn't even obey the law as God gave it.
[1567.22 → 1572.04] They couldn't obey just the basic donors. And now you're saying the obedience is higher,
[1572.44 → 1577.32] and I'm driving after the motive. It's hopeless. There's no way we can obey this law that for
[1577.32 → 1581.40] centuries Israel couldn't even obey at a basic level. You understand what I'm trying to say?
[1582.26 → 1588.10] And you do well to ask, is Jesus being cruel here? Is He demanding even more of people
[1588.10 → 1592.76] that have proven that they cannot obey God's law? Like what is He doing? And why would He make it
[1592.76 → 1600.82] harder? That's an important question. But Jesus, just like His Father, has no interest in making
[1600.82 → 1606.20] life difficult. He has no interest in adding burdens to our lives and no interest in making these useless
[1606.20 → 1610.54] laws that are going to lead to difficulty. He's doing the same thing His Father did, where He's pointing
[1610.54 → 1617.28] back to the way we were created to live, and He's actually pointing forward to the way we will live
[1617.28 → 1624.22] when He returns. But Jesus sees the mess. He knows how hard it is for humans to obey. He sees the
[1624.22 → 1629.30] laziness. He sees the abuse of power. Furthermore, he sees the idolatrous worship of all sorts of false gods.
[1629.60 → 1635.06] He sees the workaholism. He sees the marital abuse. He sees the dishonouring of parents. Furthermore, he sees the
[1635.06 → 1640.86] false testimony. All of it He sees. And you know what He does? He takes it to the grave.
[1640.86 → 1647.70] He takes all the ways that we distort God's law, all the sinful deviations from His good instruction,
[1648.28 → 1653.00] and He says, I will break the power of sin so that you can live in this freedom.
[1654.02 → 1658.64] I will take it to the grave, and I will rise victoriously in my resurrection. I will invite
[1658.64 → 1666.50] you into that resurrection life. And here's my Holy Spirit to enable you and empower you and equip you
[1666.50 → 1673.90] to follow me. And as I prepared my sermon, I couldn't help but thinking of Jesus' own words in the
[1673.90 → 1678.20] Gospel of Matthew. This is chapter 11. We spent a fair bit of time on these when we looked at our
[1678.20 → 1683.48] Apprenticing with Jesus series. And Jesus says, and this is a beautiful invitation, come to me,
[1684.26 → 1692.56] all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
[1692.56 → 1701.14] for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy,
[1702.02 → 1704.30] and my burden is light.
[1707.86 → 1713.88] I want to finish with just two things, I think. The first is, if you've come here this morning,
[1714.82 → 1719.54] and you feel the enslaving power of whatever false worship, whatever idol, whatever twisted
[1719.54 → 1729.06] law you're living out, know that the solution is Jesus. The pathway to freedom is following Jesus.
[1730.20 → 1737.60] And the way of us living as a flourishing community is obedience to Jesus. And I think there's a lot of
[1737.60 → 1742.54] us, even this morning, who in one way or another may be a secret idol or something that's just destroying
[1742.54 → 1749.00] our life over time. We need to hear that. The solution to what we're enslaved to is obedience
[1749.00 → 1756.54] to Jesus. And by his grace and by his spirit, we can step forward little bit by little bit into that
[1756.54 → 1761.78] freedom. Never perfectly, I've talked about this last week, Jesus will meet us in grace as we fall,
[1762.04 → 1767.86] and he will pick us up and give us the strength to keep walking and experiencing freedom.
[1767.86 → 1775.08] If you are experiencing the hollow, deceptive emptiness of what Western society calls freedom,
[1775.58 → 1782.32] it's found in the easy yoke of Jesus. And he will teach us, and we can learn to follow him
[1782.32 → 1789.58] and step into that blessing. And I think if you're wondering what that looks like, I do encourage you
[1789.58 → 1794.36] this week, read just the Sermon on the Mount, just the Sermon on the Mount, get a taste of the life Jesus
[1794.36 → 1802.06] is inviting all of us into as a church community. Secondly, I want to talk about the way in which the
[1802.06 → 1807.24] world, our city, our friends, and our neighbours need to see the flourishing life on display.
[1808.06 → 1812.64] I talked about last week how God places Israel in Canaan so that the neighbouring nations can see it.
[1812.70 → 1818.14] And in the same way, he places you in your home, in your workplace, in your circle of friends,
[1818.20 → 1824.02] of the soccer field, in the school, so that your life following Jesus can be on display. Do you know that?
[1825.02 → 1828.34] It's no longer just one nation. It's all over the world in all of our spheres of life.
[1828.80 → 1836.40] And I happen to think many people come to faith when they actually see the gospel living in someone's
[1836.40 → 1842.42] life. And I'll just give you two examples of how I've experienced this. You know, a number of years
[1842.42 → 1846.50] ago, I was doing international student ministry, and I got to know a young woman who's actually from
[1846.50 → 1851.22] Japan. She lived in Tokyo, and she moved here to do studies. And we got her involved in the church.
[1851.22 → 1855.30] She had never been to a church, saw it, actually. She went to church, interestingly, to get to know
[1855.30 → 1859.40] Canadian culture. And I said, just so you know, the church is probably not the best way to get to know
[1859.40 → 1863.86] Canadian culture, but we'll take it. We'll use it. And she got to know the young adults at the church,
[1863.86 → 1868.80] and she was so fascinated by how these young adults lived. And one of the things she noticed,
[1868.92 → 1873.42] interesting to me, is that they weren't competing with each other for grades. They weren't competing
[1873.42 → 1879.94] with each other for jobs. They were just concerned and in community with each other and friends.
[1879.94 → 1885.46] And she said, her whole life, so many classmates were competing for this job, competing for that
[1885.46 → 1890.22] grade. And she realized, here's a group of people that actually care for one another, and they're not
[1890.22 → 1896.92] competing in life. And that was her first step towards seeing obedience to Jesus lived out in
[1896.92 → 1901.64] mutual care. Second example is from my own life. When Brittany and I were just getting to know each
[1901.64 → 1907.46] other, we got invited over to a family in her church. This couple was probably my age now,
[1907.46 → 1911.24] and they had young kids, and they invited us over for dinner. So we shared a meal with them,
[1911.28 → 1915.48] had a great conversation. We stayed there a long time. We saw them put their kids to bed. I remember
[1915.48 → 1920.08] we were leaving their place, and something about that night, the way their husband and wife lived
[1920.08 → 1924.18] together, the way they spent with their kids, I just thought to myself, that's what I want.
[1924.98 → 1929.04] That's what I want in my marriage. That's how I want to raise my kids. I caught a glimpse of how
[1929.04 → 1934.30] beautiful family could be, and it drew me in. And still, I think back to that time with them,
[1934.30 → 1939.42] I think, I want to be that kind of parent. I want to be that kind of husband. And the point is simple.
[1940.22 → 1946.76] People need to see the blessing of life and obedience to Jesus. It really is freedom. And
[1946.76 → 1951.60] when you see it, you're like, okay, I see that. That's freedom, and I want that. I've experienced
[1951.60 → 1960.76] that myself. I bet you, you have in various ways as well. We are sent by Jesus, the Lord of the church,
[1960.76 → 1966.90] to live in obedience to Him before our watching, curious neighbours.
[1968.84 → 1974.60] And coming back to that lie of freedom that our culture lives in, you have millions of people
[1974.60 → 1983.94] living around you that have no idea where freedom is found. They have no idea there's something far
[1983.94 → 1989.00] more beautiful than their cell phone will give them. Something far more beautiful than their stock
[1989.00 → 1994.10] options will give them. Something far more beautiful than even their family and their marriage can give
[1994.10 → 2001.16] them. And that is Jesus Christ, crucified, resurrected, healing His creation, starting with the church.
[2001.16 → 2009.32] They need to see it. And they need to see what it looks like in our work lives, in our family lives,
[2009.32 → 2016.98] in our academic lives, our leisure lives, and in our shared life. That's where the love of Christ flows
[2016.98 → 2023.78] through, where the blessing comes not just to us, but through us. And my prayer is that many people,
[2023.78 → 2031.54] even in this season of disconnection and loneliness, will taste the beautiful, flourishing life that comes
[2031.54 → 2037.44] with obedience to the good instruction of our loving Father. Let's pray.
[2042.32 → 2044.02] Lord, we thank You for Your Word.
[2044.02 → 2052.80] Lord, we recognize that when we look at this instruction, we can feel indifferent, we can feel
[2052.80 → 2060.28] judged, we can feel frustrated by lingering sin. And so we ask that Your grace that comes to us from
[2060.28 → 2067.50] Jesus would cleanse us. And we ask that Your Holy Spirit would be poured out on us so that we can live
[2067.50 → 2070.08] in the freedom of following Jesus.
[2072.24 → 2074.82] Lord, enable us to experience Your blessing
[2074.82 → 2077.70] so that the whole world would know
[2077.70 → 2079.86] that in Jesus is life.
[2081.06 → 2081.46] Amen.
[2084.30 → 2087.14] I invite you to stand and sing with me our closing song,
[2087.24 → 2089.60] which really tells the whole story, King of Kings.
