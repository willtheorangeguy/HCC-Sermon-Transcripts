[0.00 → 12.46] Good morning.
[12.46 → 12.50] Good morning.
[16.32 → 23.24] It was such a blessing to witness the welcoming of two new members to a community of faith,
[23.42 → 24.48] to the people of God.
[24.48 → 30.16] And I think it goes really well with the message that we have before us today.
[30.98 → 38.32] And before we get to the text that we want to look at, I want to read the two verses preceding
[38.32 → 43.96] them because it highlights and emphasizes that identity that we have as the people of
[43.96 → 44.28] God.
[44.88 → 50.92] And so if you have your Bibles with you on your phone or with a physical Bible, if you could
[50.92 → 59.24] have it open to 1 Peter 2, we will be looking at verses 11 to 17, but I will be reading right
[59.24 → 61.36] now for you verse 9 and 10.
[64.36 → 65.30] It says,
[65.30 → 95.28] And that's what today's baptism symbolizes.
[95.28 → 96.28] The welcoming.
[96.28 → 98.28] You are now a people.
[98.28 → 105.24] And this people, there are many descriptions of what this people are described as here.
[105.24 → 112.44] But one of the descriptions are, you are a people who have received God's loving mercy.
[112.44 → 118.40] And already we have this gospel background, this gospel narrative, identifying who we are.
[118.40 → 120.40] First and foremost, you are redeemed.
[120.40 → 124.20] You are a redeemed people by the blood of Christ.
[125.20 → 126.12] God's mercy.
[127.60 → 132.76] And so as we continue our series on servanthood, I want to invite you today to look at what it
[132.76 → 134.66] means to serve in our city.
[136.16 → 139.10] And so reading on from the rest of the text.
[139.10 → 140.86] So we are now at verse 11.
[141.10 → 142.36] I will continue to read.
[143.10 → 151.06] Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain
[151.06 → 155.10] from sinful desires which wage war against your soul.
[155.10 → 161.32] Live such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see
[161.32 → 164.40] your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
[165.56 → 171.32] Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority, whether to the emperor as the
[171.32 → 176.02] supreme authority, or to the governors who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong
[176.02 → 177.80] and to commend those who do right.
[177.80 → 184.00] For it is God's will that by doing good, you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.
[185.42 → 190.70] So, live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.
[191.48 → 192.86] Live as God's slaves.
[194.30 → 196.00] Show proper respect to everyone.
[196.66 → 197.88] Love the family of believers.
[198.60 → 199.34] Fear God.
[199.92 → 200.90] Honour the emperor.
[202.06 → 203.10] Honour the emperor.
[203.10 → 210.42] And so, as I reminded you of our identity this morning, and as we were reminded through
[210.42 → 213.46] the sacrament of baptism, I'm going to emphasize this a lot.
[213.56 → 215.22] So, I hope you can get used to it.
[215.26 → 216.84] I'm going to say identity a lot.
[217.24 → 218.62] People of God a lot.
[219.14 → 226.44] And this identity, the people who have received that mercy, that gospel background, it continues
[226.44 → 226.74] on.
[226.82 → 228.58] Peter says, dear friends.
[229.04 → 232.66] Now, I don't know why Peter didn't translate this.
[232.66 → 236.18] The NIV translates this into English as friends.
[237.06 → 239.62] When in the Greek, it's actually the word for beloved.
[240.68 → 242.28] Peter is identifying again.
[242.40 → 243.28] It's a continuance.
[243.60 → 245.08] Calling out to the people of God.
[245.26 → 248.26] The people of God who have received his loving mercy.
[248.64 → 254.66] And so, Peter is addressing the people of God again by saying, in verse 11, dear friends
[254.66 → 255.82] doesn't do it quite well.
[256.30 → 257.06] Dear beloved.
[257.06 → 259.20] Dear beloved of God.
[259.52 → 262.44] Who loves each other.
[264.90 → 268.38] You are foreigners and exiles.
[269.08 → 271.92] And then he goes on to say, abstain from all sinful desires.
[272.64 → 273.88] Foreigners and exiles.
[273.88 → 278.64] He also uses the same term foreigner in chapter 1.
[279.10 → 283.72] And I believe this is one of the main motives behind this whole letter that Peter writes.
[284.84 → 289.58] Of how we should live out our lives as a people of God in this world.
[290.44 → 292.86] Which we are foreigners and exiles of.
[292.86 → 296.90] Why we are called that is what we want to look at today.
[297.58 → 302.94] And so, simply stated, Peter is saying that we as Christians, as people of God, again, people
[302.94 → 308.76] who have received God's loving mercy, that gospel background, are in the world, but you are
[308.76 → 309.56] not of the world.
[310.60 → 312.12] We are definitely in it.
[312.78 → 314.20] We are not separate from it.
[314.58 → 315.40] You are in it.
[315.40 → 317.46] But the difference is, you are not of it.
[319.44 → 324.26] And I said this when I used to teach kids ministry in Korea.
[324.62 → 325.86] This was one of our main themes.
[326.12 → 326.82] Identifying us.
[327.30 → 329.06] Identifying us as the people of God.
[329.36 → 330.96] And how we are not just separate.
[331.82 → 332.98] We are not separate from the world.
[333.08 → 334.76] We are in the world, but not of the world.
[334.90 → 336.48] And we would say this every single week.
[337.16 → 339.92] It's like, it was a cornerstone for our church.
[340.04 → 343.20] And we would say every week, I would start in the world.
[343.20 → 346.14] And the kids would say, not of the world.
[347.56 → 350.30] And this idea we saw also in Romans 12.
[350.82 → 354.48] And I don't know if you remember, when we first started this series on servanthood, that
[354.48 → 356.74] was the first passage that we looked at in Romans 12.
[357.60 → 358.56] It's a famous verse.
[358.94 → 360.12] I'm just going to quote verse 2.
[360.58 → 367.80] Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[370.44 → 372.28] This is our calling once again.
[372.28 → 381.32] We are transformed into God's narrative, which means that we cannot, and we do not identify
[381.32 → 383.38] to this world's narrative.
[384.76 → 387.52] And so, this is my invitation to you all this morning.
[388.48 → 394.84] I want to invite you to reflect on our identity as the foreigners and exiles here on earth,
[395.02 → 400.56] and how we can witness Christ for those around us, in our community and in our city.
[400.56 → 404.36] So, let's ask the question.
[404.60 → 405.76] Now, this is all well and good.
[405.90 → 408.14] Okay, witness to Christ wherever you are.
[408.60 → 411.50] It's a very plain mission message that we have.
[411.78 → 412.56] That's our identity.
[412.56 → 417.60] But the question I want to ask and the question that always comes up is, how?
[418.54 → 420.60] How do we witness to Christ?
[420.60 → 426.84] Simply put, and I'm quoting Mark for this.
[427.12 → 430.40] Mark as in Mark Glanville, who teaches mission church at our school.
[430.86 → 433.12] And he always says this, every single class.
[433.20 → 433.90] It's like his motto.
[434.36 → 440.10] He says, we witness to Christ, and we must witness to Christ in creative ways through life, word,
[440.18 → 440.58] and deed.
[440.88 → 443.74] Personally and as a church, as a people of God.
[443.74 → 445.80] So, life, word, and deed.
[447.04 → 452.58] And in our text today, Peter gives us three ways, I think, of witnessing mission for our city.
[454.14 → 461.00] First, a significant and obvious part of this life, word, and deed is to abstain from all sinful desires,
[462.02 → 464.88] which wage war against your soul.
[465.36 → 467.96] And that waging war part I want to get to a little bit later.
[468.28 → 471.22] But I want to focus on the abstaining from sin right now.
[471.22 → 478.04] He also says earlier on in this chapter, so same chapter, chapter 2 and verse 1, he says,
[479.12 → 485.50] therefore, rid yourselves of all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, slander of every kind.
[486.04 → 489.30] So, he's pointing out some of the sins that we might struggle with.
[490.06 → 496.20] And he starts off saying this by saying, therefore, stay away from all these sins.
[497.06 → 498.20] What's that therefore?
[498.96 → 499.32] Therefore.
[500.22 → 500.74] Do you get it?
[501.22 → 503.48] Why is that therefore there?
[505.24 → 510.92] The background to that is also same thing, over and over, repetition of identifying who you are.
[511.20 → 514.68] You are a people of God in the world, but not of the world.
[514.92 → 526.04] Therefore, abstain from all deceit, all malice, hypocrisy, envy, slander, and of every kind.
[526.04 → 528.46] So, verse 11 again.
[528.46 → 532.42] Abstain from sinful desires which wage war against your soul.
[534.74 → 535.96] That's the first part.
[536.90 → 538.52] Secondly, how we witness.
[538.52 → 539.52] I lost my place.
[539.52 → 542.30] I lost my place here.
[542.30 → 548.94] Secondly, he also says, so, since you are the people of God and identify in his narrative,
[549.78 → 558.10] live such good lives among the pagans, so the non-believers, the world that does not identify in God's narrative,
[558.10 → 566.28] that though they accuse you of doing wrong, or literally from the Greek it says, though they accuse you as evildoers,
[566.28 → 574.08] they call you evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
[574.08 → 582.42] So, they may accuse you of doing wrong, but they will glorify God through witnessing to your good deeds.
[582.96 → 583.78] Life, word, and deed.
[584.76 → 590.96] Third, by submitting to every human authority, like the emperor and his governors,
[591.44 → 595.68] it is God's will that by doing good, we should silence the ignorance of foolish people.
[595.68 → 601.52] So, whatever the emperors and the governors may be in our lives today,
[602.18 → 605.24] whether I need to pull out that Trudeau word here,
[605.60 → 610.32] or whatever governor or whatever politician that we may think of in our context here,
[610.68 → 613.46] respect them, obey all authority.
[614.84 → 618.66] And by doing good, by identifying as God's people,
[619.26 → 623.84] we should silence the ignorance of some of the politicians we may not agree with.
[623.84 → 631.04] Some of the politicians that may not be coherent to the narrative that we identify with.
[633.86 → 637.90] Now, these are some of the basic things that I pulled out from this text,
[638.12 → 639.94] the three ways that we can witness to Christ.
[640.66 → 644.36] But as I read this text for the first time, as I was preparing for this sermon,
[644.72 → 647.02] and as I was really wrestling hard with it,
[648.00 → 651.66] a couple of questions came up that I just couldn't answer at the beginning.
[651.66 → 659.02] And I really struggled hard, and I was wondering why Peter would say such things that we looked at here.
[659.66 → 663.38] So, the two questions that I had in my mind as I was reading this text was first,
[664.32 → 669.70] why in the world, why the heck would non-believers accuse us as evildoers,
[669.94 → 674.74] as doing wrong when we are striving to live such good lives?
[674.74 → 678.46] It sounds like Peter is contradicting himself.
[678.74 → 680.26] He's not, but it sounds like it.
[680.70 → 685.88] So, he's saying, okay, live such good lives because you identify as God's people,
[686.06 → 691.20] because we identify in God's redemptive narrative for the whole, the all creation.
[692.94 → 695.88] Do good, but be called evil for it.
[695.88 → 701.78] Why would the world point their fingers and call us evil,
[702.52 → 706.46] doing wrong when we're trying to live such good lives,
[707.08 → 710.32] that they may see our deeds, good deeds, and glorify God?
[710.60 → 712.90] Why would they call us evildoers?
[715.48 → 717.12] Also, he says in verse 16,
[717.12 → 718.80] to live as free people.
[719.40 → 724.42] So, this identity, and what's included in this identity is also live as free people,
[725.34 → 728.26] but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil,
[728.66 → 731.60] but live as God's slaves, which is true freedom.
[733.44 → 738.32] Okay, that's easy enough, but again, the second question that I had trouble with was,
[738.98 → 741.82] why the heck would be now, not the world,
[741.82 → 748.72] why would we, as God's free people, use that freedom we have and cover up evil?
[750.50 → 753.30] Live good lives, be blamed as evildoers,
[753.56 → 756.54] don't use your freedom to cover up for your sin.
[758.56 → 760.32] Why would we cover up our sin?
[761.66 → 765.14] Why would we be accused of doing wrong in the first place when we're trying,
[765.38 → 767.66] when Peter is telling us to live such good lives?
[768.06 → 768.78] I don't get it.
[768.90 → 770.00] What are you trying to say, Peter?
[771.82 → 775.24] It sounds as if Peter is trying, assuming,
[775.88 → 779.84] as if Peter is assuming that every person of God, every Christian,
[781.32 → 782.98] will struggle against evil,
[784.00 → 789.00] against the sinful desires which wage war against your soul.
[790.64 → 793.52] He's assuming that everyone will have this struggle.
[794.74 → 796.02] Every person of God will.
[797.52 → 799.90] So again, what is Peter trying to say?
[799.90 → 800.88] Do good?
[801.22 → 801.90] Live good lives?
[802.20 → 802.52] Yes.
[802.94 → 803.96] That's the obvious part.
[804.44 → 806.88] But why would we be blamed for doing this wrong?
[807.38 → 811.86] Why would we be blamed as evildoers when we're trying to live good lives?
[812.06 → 812.52] Okay, I'm sorry.
[812.60 → 814.50] I'm asking the same question over and over again.
[814.66 → 816.68] You can see what was going on in my head throughout the week.
[816.68 → 817.56] Why?
[818.10 → 818.54] Why?
[818.98 → 821.08] Why would the world blame us for being evil?
[821.50 → 824.78] I'm trying to live such a good life for the world.
[825.12 → 827.94] Trying to be a blessing for my community, for my city.
[828.54 → 830.02] But why would they call me evil?
[830.02 → 833.76] Well, this is the answer that I came up with.
[835.14 → 840.00] And I think it is because we identify in a different narrative.
[841.28 → 844.76] We identify with God's redemption narrative.
[845.24 → 849.90] And this identity itself is waging war against the sinful nature,
[850.26 → 852.04] the sinful narrative of the world,
[852.30 → 854.92] which is also within ourselves.
[854.92 → 859.50] So why would the world point their finger and say,
[860.34 → 861.14] you evildoers?
[862.14 → 865.76] Or you guys are just living the wrong life.
[866.74 → 869.86] And that also happens within ourselves.
[871.24 → 875.62] And this, I would say, is spiritual warfare.
[877.00 → 880.92] The world is saying, no, we need to live for ourselves.
[881.56 → 883.18] You live for your own happiness.
[884.92 → 888.82] Whereas we say, no, we live for God first and foremost.
[888.82 → 892.76] And we live for others, before ourselves.
[894.58 → 896.68] Serve God, serve others.
[897.54 → 899.40] That's our identity.
[899.58 → 900.88] That's our narrative.
[901.32 → 903.12] And so the world is saying, that's wrong.
[903.70 → 904.78] You're doing wrong.
[905.20 → 907.46] That's bad in our own eyes.
[908.10 → 909.80] And that reflects that sinful nature.
[909.80 → 915.84] And that same struggle happens within ourselves.
[915.96 → 919.18] And again, I suggest that this is the spiritual warfare.
[919.72 → 921.76] And when I think of spiritual warfare,
[922.20 → 923.60] a good analogy that I,
[924.46 → 925.90] I don't know if I grew up with it,
[925.98 → 928.26] but a good analogy that I was reminded of,
[928.82 → 931.42] and it's a very good Canadian analogy, in my opinion,
[931.86 → 934.54] is thinking about the life of a salmon.
[934.54 → 936.46] I don't know if you like salmon.
[936.48 → 937.20] I love salmon.
[937.34 → 939.40] Salmon is the best fish out there.
[940.04 → 942.32] I can eat it in any different ways, you know.
[942.56 → 944.02] Especially raw, it's just the best.
[944.52 → 944.94] Salmon.
[945.74 → 949.58] I know some people can't handle the raw food in general.
[950.02 → 953.00] But the life of a salmon is so beautiful in that,
[953.50 → 955.32] if you know the general cycle,
[955.98 → 958.14] they're born, they go out to the sea,
[958.20 → 958.90] they come back,
[958.90 → 959.96] and their end goal,
[960.14 → 962.34] their ultimate purpose is to go back
[962.34 → 965.04] to the place where they were born and die.
[966.26 → 968.18] And that's, there's a sad beauty in that.
[969.00 → 970.64] But I don't want to talk about that part.
[970.70 → 973.40] I don't want to talk about them coming back,
[973.76 → 974.82] making a full cycle,
[975.44 → 976.08] giving life.
[976.34 → 977.82] So if you're a female, you lay the eggs.
[977.88 → 978.78] If you're a male, salmon,
[978.88 → 980.08] then you fertilize the eggs.
[980.28 → 982.32] And then you die there while giving life.
[982.52 → 983.98] I think there's something beautiful in that.
[984.22 → 985.14] I could say much more,
[985.14 → 988.12] but I want to focus on the last little part
[988.12 → 989.58] of how they swim.
[990.26 → 993.12] They swim upstream against the current
[993.12 → 994.08] to reach their goal.
[995.82 → 998.54] Sometimes they even jump over small waterfalls.
[1000.08 → 1001.34] It's very impressive.
[1002.00 → 1003.56] There's beauty in God's creation there.
[1003.94 → 1005.24] And it reflects, I think,
[1005.32 → 1006.90] the spiritual warfare that we have
[1006.90 → 1008.36] of always going upstream
[1008.36 → 1010.00] against the current,
[1010.38 → 1013.08] the current narrative of the world.
[1013.08 → 1015.08] And we're always struggling
[1015.08 → 1016.34] to fight against
[1016.34 → 1018.84] all of those sinful desires,
[1019.20 → 1020.52] all of those sinful narratives
[1020.52 → 1021.78] that keep pulling us,
[1021.98 → 1023.26] or pushing us, I should say,
[1023.62 → 1025.54] toward what they think is right.
[1026.78 → 1028.12] And if I were a salmon,
[1028.78 → 1029.62] I wouldn't want to
[1029.62 → 1031.22] give up my whole life
[1031.22 → 1032.74] so that I could go
[1032.74 → 1033.70] toward that end goal
[1033.70 → 1035.28] where you go and ultimately die.
[1035.92 → 1036.96] The temptation, I think,
[1036.98 → 1038.12] would always be there,
[1038.54 → 1039.92] speaking on behalf of a salmon,
[1039.92 → 1041.72] to always just relax
[1041.72 → 1043.18] and let the flow take you
[1043.18 → 1045.74] and just go with the flow, literally.
[1046.90 → 1047.94] Go with the flow.
[1048.90 → 1049.94] The world is saying,
[1050.28 → 1051.28] live for your own happiness.
[1052.28 → 1054.38] You don't need to live for God
[1054.38 → 1055.36] and give up your life
[1055.36 → 1056.90] and be committed to serving others.
[1057.92 → 1059.26] Live for your own happiness.
[1060.74 → 1062.54] The last time I was here preaching,
[1062.72 → 1065.24] I gave an example from the show Friends
[1065.24 → 1068.46] and how my wife and I enjoyed watching that.
[1068.68 → 1070.10] But the narrative of that drama
[1070.10 → 1071.64] is about your own happiness.
[1072.62 → 1075.22] But my wife and I usually enjoy Korean,
[1075.44 → 1076.60] not sitcoms,
[1076.90 → 1078.58] but Korean reality TV shows.
[1078.88 → 1079.58] And usually,
[1080.14 → 1081.80] the Korean reality TV shows,
[1081.94 → 1084.02] and 99% of their shows,
[1084.62 → 1086.34] is based on this one word,
[1087.12 → 1087.50] healing.
[1088.74 → 1090.18] Whatever show you watch,
[1090.30 → 1091.36] they'll mention that word
[1091.36 → 1093.60] at least once in that episode.
[1093.60 → 1096.56] Oh, I live such a busy life.
[1096.70 → 1098.40] Oh, it was so busy
[1098.40 → 1099.40] and I'm so tired.
[1099.58 → 1100.36] I want some rest.
[1100.44 → 1101.42] So I went to the mountain.
[1101.76 → 1102.34] I relaxed
[1102.34 → 1104.24] and I had some healing time.
[1104.76 → 1105.18] Or,
[1105.50 → 1106.86] I got together with friends
[1106.86 → 1107.78] and we went out drinking
[1107.78 → 1109.06] and we had such a good time
[1109.06 → 1111.30] and that brought healing for my life.
[1112.40 → 1112.72] Oh,
[1112.90 → 1114.16] I went out and donated
[1114.16 → 1114.92] a bunch of things
[1114.92 → 1116.24] and that made me feel good
[1116.24 → 1118.14] and it provided me with healing.
[1119.30 → 1119.52] Now,
[1119.62 → 1120.62] I have nothing against that,
[1120.76 → 1121.62] making donations
[1121.62 → 1122.76] and doing good deeds,
[1122.76 → 1124.80] but the whole thing
[1124.80 → 1126.42] is about my own happiness.
[1126.98 → 1128.44] I give so that I can,
[1128.80 → 1130.26] only I can be happy.
[1131.00 → 1131.72] I live
[1131.72 → 1132.80] and I make money
[1132.80 → 1134.92] and I base my whole entire life
[1134.92 → 1136.18] and even my marriage
[1136.18 → 1137.68] and all the family life
[1137.68 → 1138.24] that I live
[1138.24 → 1139.68] so that I can be happy.
[1139.78 → 1140.84] It's about me, me, me.
[1142.44 → 1143.54] And for us,
[1143.98 → 1146.52] it's about God and others
[1146.52 → 1147.78] and our city,
[1148.30 → 1149.08] serving others.
[1149.18 → 1150.04] And so we're going
[1150.04 → 1151.72] always against this current.
[1151.72 → 1153.74] Again,
[1154.04 → 1155.04] with the temptation,
[1155.64 → 1156.50] just go with the flow
[1156.50 → 1157.26] and, yeah,
[1157.36 → 1158.58] just I want to be happy as well.
[1164.48 → 1165.28] And so,
[1165.76 → 1166.54] I think,
[1166.96 → 1168.82] as we fight this good fight,
[1169.52 → 1170.54] this spiritual warfare
[1170.54 → 1171.76] that we have before us,
[1172.46 → 1174.20] even though they blame us
[1174.20 → 1176.40] for living in the wrong narrative,
[1176.40 → 1177.92] they blame us
[1177.92 → 1179.48] for that fight in itself,
[1180.12 → 1180.94] that we are living
[1180.94 → 1181.76] in a different narrative
[1181.76 → 1182.98] that goes against the current,
[1184.12 → 1185.44] even though they blame us,
[1185.58 → 1186.12] the world,
[1186.26 → 1187.94] even though they may blame us for it,
[1189.00 → 1190.68] they will see God
[1190.68 → 1192.44] and they will glorify God
[1192.44 → 1194.56] because that's ultimately
[1194.56 → 1196.42] the only and true narrative.
[1196.42 → 1200.54] And I suggest further
[1200.54 → 1201.48] that this effort
[1201.48 → 1202.70] of living against
[1202.70 → 1203.58] the world's narrative
[1203.58 → 1205.22] is the good deeds
[1205.22 → 1205.78] that Peter
[1205.78 → 1207.70] urges us to do.
[1208.54 → 1209.86] Live such good lives.
[1210.36 → 1211.42] Do good deeds.
[1211.82 → 1213.00] Always keep up
[1213.00 → 1213.58] the good fight.
[1213.88 → 1214.88] Be Always struggling
[1214.88 → 1216.28] against the world's narrative.
[1216.28 → 1219.62] We are not perfect
[1219.62 → 1221.34] and we will never be,
[1221.88 → 1223.10] but we fight and struggle
[1223.10 → 1224.60] to abstain from all evil
[1224.60 → 1227.66] and live as a freed people of God
[1227.66 → 1228.86] because by the power
[1228.86 → 1229.62] of the Holy Spirit,
[1229.88 → 1231.00] by God's grace,
[1231.16 → 1232.68] we are a free people.
[1236.20 → 1236.76] Again,
[1237.12 → 1238.10] living for God,
[1238.22 → 1238.94] living for others
[1238.94 → 1239.82] instead of myself.
[1240.34 → 1241.34] Serving God,
[1241.74 → 1242.48] serving others
[1242.48 → 1243.70] instead of myself.
[1245.16 → 1245.50] And so,
[1245.50 → 1246.78] as we conclude this morning,
[1247.34 → 1248.66] I want to turn and reflect
[1248.66 → 1249.98] on some of the practical
[1249.98 → 1251.00] implications of this.
[1252.06 → 1253.36] How can we witness
[1253.36 → 1254.42] through life,
[1254.52 → 1255.00] word and deed
[1255.00 → 1255.96] in Clayton, Surrey
[1255.96 → 1258.30] or wherever you are?
[1259.88 → 1261.38] How can we make God
[1261.38 → 1262.98] known to those around us?
[1264.08 → 1265.08] And I wanted to be
[1265.08 → 1265.78] a little bit more
[1265.78 → 1266.60] creative this morning
[1266.60 → 1267.62] so that I'm not
[1267.62 → 1268.70] a creative person whatsoever,
[1269.10 → 1270.02] but I want to pretend
[1270.02 → 1271.22] to be creative a little bit.
[1271.56 → 1272.50] So I took a page
[1272.50 → 1273.52] from Jesus' letters
[1273.52 → 1274.18] to the churches
[1274.18 → 1275.74] to Asia Minor.
[1276.02 → 1276.90] And we did this
[1276.90 → 1277.48] in our series
[1277.48 → 1278.06] in Revelation.
[1278.20 → 1278.54] I don't know
[1278.54 → 1279.04] if you remember.
[1279.56 → 1280.78] And we invited you guys
[1280.78 → 1282.36] to also write a letter
[1282.36 → 1283.76] assuming that,
[1284.14 → 1285.28] thinking about
[1285.28 → 1285.92] and reflecting
[1285.92 → 1287.14] what Jesus might say
[1287.14 → 1288.36] to Hope Community Church.
[1288.36 → 1290.90] And this is my version of it.
[1292.28 → 1292.98] And so,
[1293.10 → 1293.66] I'm thinking
[1293.66 → 1295.12] Jesus would say this to us.
[1295.76 → 1296.86] Hear the words from Jesus.
[1297.36 → 1298.66] To the beloved
[1298.66 → 1300.10] in Clayton Heights
[1300.10 → 1301.80] to Hope Community Church,
[1301.80 → 1304.78] I commend you for your generosity
[1304.78 → 1306.52] and helping those in your city,
[1307.06 → 1307.98] witnessing to me
[1307.98 → 1309.66] in life, word, and deed,
[1310.68 → 1312.36] especially with your resources.
[1312.74 → 1313.86] It is such a joy
[1313.86 → 1315.42] to see you living out your faith
[1315.42 → 1317.66] by providing for the needy
[1317.66 → 1319.10] and being creative,
[1319.50 → 1321.68] especially in blessing others
[1321.68 → 1323.32] even during this difficult time
[1323.32 → 1324.00] through the pandemic.
[1324.00 → 1326.28] I commend you
[1326.28 → 1327.58] for serving in Tot Romp,
[1328.02 → 1328.80] story time,
[1329.20 → 1329.96] the dollar sale,
[1330.42 → 1331.12] garbage cleanup,
[1331.42 → 1332.92] all of your various ministries
[1332.92 → 1333.50] for church,
[1334.02 → 1334.96] making donations
[1334.96 → 1335.64] with money,
[1335.96 → 1336.78] food, clothing.
[1337.64 → 1339.28] I cannot write enough
[1339.28 → 1340.40] good things about you.
[1342.60 → 1344.44] And my wish would be
[1344.44 → 1346.64] if the letter would end there.
[1347.04 → 1347.80] Just perfect.
[1348.28 → 1349.76] Jesus commending us
[1349.76 → 1350.80] for what we're doing
[1350.80 → 1351.80] for our community here
[1351.80 → 1352.86] and for ourselves here,
[1353.30 → 1354.12] blessing others.
[1354.82 → 1355.58] But I think
[1355.58 → 1356.92] Jesus wouldn't end there.
[1357.74 → 1358.60] I think he would
[1358.60 → 1359.60] continue to say,
[1360.52 → 1361.44] but be warned
[1361.44 → 1363.56] to not use your good deeds
[1363.56 → 1364.56] and identity
[1364.56 → 1365.72] as free people
[1365.72 → 1367.18] to cover up
[1367.18 → 1368.16] for your sins.
[1369.24 → 1370.24] Make every effort
[1370.24 → 1370.88] to do good
[1370.88 → 1372.12] and abstain from all evil
[1372.12 → 1373.54] because you know
[1373.54 → 1374.60] who you belong to.
[1375.12 → 1375.50] You see,
[1375.72 → 1376.52] these commands
[1376.52 → 1377.26] that we looked at
[1377.26 → 1377.90] this morning
[1377.90 → 1378.70] from 1 Peter
[1378.70 → 1380.52] are not just a list
[1380.52 → 1381.20] of religious
[1381.20 → 1382.46] rules
[1382.46 → 1383.64] or a list
[1383.64 → 1384.76] of religious requirements
[1384.76 → 1385.82] to look
[1385.82 → 1386.76] the part of being
[1386.76 → 1387.22] a Christian.
[1387.48 → 1388.90] Just to mask ourselves
[1388.90 → 1389.98] so that we can say,
[1390.10 → 1390.38] oh yeah,
[1390.46 → 1391.06] that's my identity.
[1391.14 → 1391.64] I'm a Christian.
[1392.20 → 1392.70] I'm good.
[1394.76 → 1396.06] The reality of it
[1396.06 → 1397.58] is to actually know
[1397.58 → 1398.48] and struggle
[1398.48 → 1400.02] through our brokenness
[1400.02 → 1401.70] to live as God's kingdom
[1401.70 → 1402.26] on earth.
[1402.40 → 1403.48] And this is a
[1403.48 → 1404.80] lifelong process
[1404.80 → 1406.60] just like the salmon.
[1406.60 → 1410.22] let the world
[1410.22 → 1411.58] see your struggles.
[1412.38 → 1413.54] Don't hide it
[1413.54 → 1414.54] or cover it up,
[1415.22 → 1415.96] which has been
[1415.96 → 1416.58] my experience,
[1416.66 → 1417.60] my personal experience,
[1417.78 → 1419.06] to try and cover it up
[1419.06 → 1420.60] under a religious mask
[1420.60 → 1421.24] that we may wear.
[1422.36 → 1424.46] We are saved sinners.
[1425.42 → 1428.34] We are not saved saints yet.
[1428.78 → 1430.42] We are saved sinners.
[1430.42 → 1430.56] sinners.
[1431.56 → 1432.40] And what Sid and Dave
[1432.40 → 1433.76] always likes to say here
[1433.76 → 1435.48] is that we here
[1435.48 → 1436.22] at Cope Community
[1436.22 → 1437.68] describe ourselves
[1437.68 → 1439.88] as a beautiful mess.
[1441.28 → 1442.62] A beautiful mess.
[1443.62 → 1444.24] And then somebody,
[1444.96 → 1445.28] Sandy,
[1445.68 → 1446.46] pointed out,
[1446.76 → 1447.60] look at the artwork
[1447.60 → 1449.62] that's on the stage here.
[1450.68 → 1450.94] Now,
[1451.00 → 1451.78] I'm not an art person
[1451.78 → 1452.10] at all
[1452.10 → 1453.98] and Sandy has challenged me
[1453.98 → 1455.18] to be more artsy
[1455.18 → 1458.22] so that I can be more relative
[1458.22 → 1460.24] because there's such
[1460.24 → 1461.24] a beautiful truth there.
[1461.50 → 1462.30] Look at the artwork
[1462.30 → 1463.24] and look at those
[1463.24 → 1464.62] individual pieces of paper
[1464.62 → 1465.58] that are made
[1465.58 → 1468.34] to create that work,
[1468.94 → 1469.50] that beauty.
[1470.30 → 1471.40] If you take one piece
[1471.40 → 1472.08] of paper out
[1472.08 → 1473.32] and hold it,
[1473.78 → 1475.34] it's just a paper
[1475.34 → 1476.02] and it's ripped.
[1476.18 → 1477.04] It's not pretty.
[1477.72 → 1478.86] But when you put it together,
[1479.42 → 1480.88] it creates a beautiful masterpiece.
[1482.10 → 1483.76] I think that's beautifully,
[1483.98 → 1484.90] a beautiful analogy
[1484.90 → 1487.06] of what a beautiful mess we are.
[1487.56 → 1488.80] Not perfect.
[1491.68 → 1493.46] And so I encourage you
[1493.46 → 1495.02] to continue to serve
[1495.02 → 1496.80] or join in the effort
[1496.80 → 1498.00] to be a blessing
[1498.00 → 1499.04] for those around us
[1499.04 → 1500.18] in our community,
[1500.70 → 1501.82] in your various communities
[1501.82 → 1502.66] and cities,
[1503.04 → 1503.72] wherever you are.
[1505.22 → 1506.34] And so I want to end
[1506.34 → 1507.78] with the exhortation
[1507.78 → 1508.68] that comes from Peter
[1508.68 → 1509.94] and it's the last verse
[1509.94 → 1510.64] that we looked at.
[1512.10 → 1513.36] Peter says,
[1514.26 → 1515.60] show proper respect
[1515.60 → 1516.58] to everyone,
[1517.40 → 1518.22] to everyone.
[1519.76 → 1520.70] Love the family
[1520.70 → 1521.28] of believers,
[1522.20 → 1523.40] meaning serving
[1523.40 → 1524.56] one another in love.
[1525.54 → 1526.38] Fear God,
[1527.02 → 1528.44] meaning serving God
[1528.44 → 1529.04] in love.
[1529.72 → 1531.06] And honour the emperor.
[1531.96 → 1532.72] In other words,
[1533.20 → 1534.22] serve your city
[1534.22 → 1535.28] in love.
[1535.28 → 1539.02] Please join me in prayer.
[1548.02 → 1548.96] Father God,
[1549.36 → 1552.16] we thank you this morning
[1552.16 → 1552.92] that we are able
[1552.92 → 1553.84] to gather again
[1553.84 → 1554.88] as your people
[1554.88 → 1556.92] who are called out
[1556.92 → 1557.84] from darkness
[1557.84 → 1559.24] by your loving mercy,
[1559.24 → 1560.88] that we are enabled
[1560.88 → 1562.22] and we are freed
[1562.22 → 1565.14] from the power of sin,
[1565.68 → 1566.72] that we may be able
[1566.72 → 1568.18] to give you all the glory
[1568.18 → 1569.08] through our life,
[1569.46 → 1570.30] word, and deed.
[1571.34 → 1572.34] And so that's our prayer
[1572.34 → 1573.20] this morning, Lord.
[1573.56 → 1574.72] Continue to guide us,
[1575.04 → 1576.54] continue to empower us
[1576.54 → 1577.74] to be free
[1577.74 → 1578.76] from all those sins,
[1579.14 → 1580.04] to be free
[1580.04 → 1581.72] from all sin,
[1582.58 → 1583.56] that we may live
[1583.56 → 1585.38] out our faith,
[1586.18 → 1587.32] live your kingdom
[1587.32 → 1588.04] on earth
[1588.04 → 1588.90] as it is in heaven.
[1588.90 → 1590.74] And I pray for all
[1590.74 → 1591.32] your people,
[1592.08 → 1593.58] especially the two
[1593.58 → 1595.72] that we have welcomed
[1595.72 → 1597.48] in through baptism,
[1598.16 → 1598.84] that we would be
[1598.84 → 1600.00] a blessing for others.
[1600.40 → 1601.94] We would take
[1601.94 → 1603.14] this identity of ours
[1603.14 → 1603.90] and live it out
[1603.90 → 1604.60] faithfully
[1604.60 → 1606.00] for your kingdom.
[1607.18 → 1608.42] We thank you once again
[1608.42 → 1609.44] in Jesus' name we pray.
[1610.48 → 1610.74] Amen.
[1612.70 → 1614.00] I invite you to stand
[1614.00 → 1614.72] as we sing
[1614.72 → 1615.76] our song of response.
