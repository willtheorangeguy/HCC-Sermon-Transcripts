[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.60 --> 63.76]  And as you can see, we're going to start a new sermon series on the book of Exodus.
[64.62 --> 67.24]  And it's a bit strange to actually not be doing wisdom literature.
[67.44 --> 72.08]  If you've been around Hope for a while, like three years ago we did Psalms, then we did Proverbs, and then we did Ecclesiastes.
[72.54 --> 75.96]  And I didn't think we had it in us to do eight weeks on the book of Job this summer.
[76.68 --> 79.08]  Or Song of Solomon for that matter, but that's a different reason.
[80.04 --> 85.30]  But we are doing Exodus, and someone on staff joked that it might just be the perfect series for the summer because it's about plagues.
[85.96 --> 89.62]  It's about sort of leaving oppression and captivity.
[89.86 --> 91.88]  It's about traveling to the promised land.
[91.88 --> 95.16]  And it's for none of those reasons that we're doing the book of Exodus.
[96.40 --> 99.48]  But let me just say a few words before we read the scriptures about this book.
[99.94 --> 102.76]  Exodus is a foundational book in the Old Testament.
[103.64 --> 109.88]  In fact, I would suggest that you cannot understand the Old Testament story without understanding the events of the Exodus.
[109.88 --> 114.46]  One writer describes the Exodus as the gospel of the Old Testament.
[115.22 --> 116.62]  The gospel of the Old Testament.
[116.88 --> 122.78]  This is the time when God demonstrated his power, his liberation, his love for a people,
[123.02 --> 127.54]  so that they would be in his presence and bring forth his blessing to the rest of the nations.
[128.30 --> 129.64]  This is a significant book.
[130.56 --> 136.40]  And just for those of you, I know that more and more I find in the West people are a bit, I don't know, they neglect the Old Testament.
[136.40 --> 141.22]  I want you to know that this book is so incredibly relevant for the church.
[141.70 --> 147.64]  We have so much to learn from Exodus about our relationship with God, about what it means to be his people,
[147.72 --> 151.56]  how to live with him, and how to serve as the church in this city.
[151.64 --> 153.44]  This book has so much to teach us.
[153.78 --> 157.90]  So I pray we come with the open ears that we spoke of in our Revelation series.
[158.62 --> 164.52]  And finally, let me just encourage you in your homes or on the dinner table in your devotions to read through Exodus.
[164.52 --> 166.12]  It's about 40 chapters.
[166.24 --> 167.10]  Well, it is 40 chapters.
[167.24 --> 172.38]  And if my math is right, if you read three quarters of a chapter per day, that brings you right to the end of the summer.
[172.50 --> 174.82]  So those of you who like a rigid reading schedule, there you go.
[174.90 --> 178.38]  Three quarters of a chapter per day brings you right through this book this summer.
[178.48 --> 182.22]  And that will deepen and enrich the study that we do together of this book.
[183.60 --> 187.96]  Well, if you have your Bible with me, with you, turn with me to Exodus chapter 1.
[187.96 --> 191.62]  And I'm going to read the first chapter with us this morning.
[195.94 --> 198.76]  It is so nice to hear little children in the background.
[198.98 --> 200.52]  Do not feel bad about that noise.
[200.52 --> 207.34]  These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family.
[207.60 --> 214.60]  Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
[215.04 --> 217.38]  The descendants of Jacob numbered 70 in all.
[217.90 --> 219.36]  Joseph was already in Egypt.
[220.40 --> 223.42]  Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died.
[224.10 --> 226.06]  But the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful.
[226.06 --> 232.58]  They multiplied greatly, increasing in number, and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.
[233.48 --> 236.72]  Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came into power in Egypt.
[237.54 --> 242.24]  Look, he said to his people, the Israelites have come far too numerous for us.
[242.76 --> 246.08]  Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous.
[246.22 --> 250.58]  And if war breaks out, we'll join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.
[251.66 --> 255.56]  So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor.
[256.06 --> 259.10]  And they built Pithom and Ramses as store cities for Pharaoh.
[259.78 --> 263.70]  But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread.
[264.48 --> 268.76]  So the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites and worked them ruthlessly.
[269.30 --> 274.42]  They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar, with all kinds of work in the fields.
[274.56 --> 278.90]  And in all their harsh labor, the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.
[278.90 --> 283.60]  The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shipra and Pua,
[284.12 --> 287.58]  When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool,
[287.88 --> 289.96]  if it's a boy, kill him.
[290.52 --> 292.72]  But if it's a girl, let her live.
[293.64 --> 297.88]  The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do.
[298.38 --> 299.46]  They let the boys live.
[300.26 --> 302.30]  Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them,
[302.36 --> 303.26]  Why have you done this?
[303.26 --> 304.98]  Why have you let the boys live?
[305.64 --> 306.90]  The midwives answered Pharaoh,
[307.28 --> 309.06]  Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women.
[309.52 --> 312.32]  They are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.
[313.32 --> 317.10]  So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.
[317.80 --> 320.96]  And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.
[321.84 --> 323.98]  Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people,
[324.40 --> 328.54]  Every Hebrew boy that is born to you must be thrown into the Nile,
[328.96 --> 330.90]  but let every girl live.
[330.90 --> 335.96]  And on that sobering note, we conclude our reading this morning in the book of Exodus.
[338.82 --> 343.90]  Three years ago now, I had the opportunity to visit the country Hungary on a study leave.
[344.34 --> 346.90]  I got to spend time with pastors and church leaders there.
[347.54 --> 350.82]  And I learned quickly that Hungarians, unlike Canadians,
[351.68 --> 353.44]  know a lot about their history,
[353.82 --> 355.88]  and they talk a lot about their history.
[356.58 --> 359.02]  It felt like every time I asked them questions about their architecture,
[359.02 --> 360.72]  or a family life, or politics,
[360.92 --> 362.68]  they would tell me their story.
[363.24 --> 365.58]  And if you don't know, the Hungarians have quite a story.
[366.22 --> 368.80]  They were occupied by Germany in World War II,
[368.92 --> 370.76]  then after that they were occupied by the Soviets,
[371.16 --> 372.14]  then they had communism,
[372.34 --> 374.02]  then there was the fall of the Berlin Wall.
[374.32 --> 376.42]  They had gone through a great deal of oppression.
[377.08 --> 380.24]  And they want you to know the story of how they came out of that oppression,
[380.78 --> 382.12]  and how they live in freedom now.
[382.12 --> 386.50]  I think if you were to have a casual conversation,
[386.70 --> 389.48]  if you could teleport back in time with any Israelite,
[389.86 --> 391.28]  after the events of the Exodus,
[392.16 --> 394.14]  they would be the same as the Hungarians.
[394.30 --> 397.52]  They could not hold back the story of the Exodus.
[397.88 --> 399.98]  It was so formative, it was so shaping,
[400.16 --> 403.32]  that they would have to tell you the story of what God did.
[404.02 --> 405.30]  Once they were slaves,
[405.78 --> 408.00]  then God showed up and freed them.
[408.00 --> 410.74]  This was their story to tell.
[412.90 --> 417.12]  Now, I think a lot of us probably know a fair bit about the book of Exodus.
[417.88 --> 420.28]  In fact, just as a guess, you can say it loud.
[420.42 --> 421.52]  When you think of the book of Exodus,
[421.70 --> 422.42]  what comes to mind?
[422.48 --> 423.00]  What stories?
[424.96 --> 426.10]  You can speak, it's okay.
[427.70 --> 428.02]  Moses?
[428.30 --> 428.84]  I'll give you a hint.
[428.92 --> 430.24]  One involves water.
[431.68 --> 432.50]  The Red Sea?
[432.64 --> 434.16]  Anything else come to mind with Exodus?
[435.66 --> 435.98]  Plagues?
[438.00 --> 438.66]  See dividing?
[440.12 --> 441.10]  Ten commandments.
[441.24 --> 441.66]  That's right.
[441.76 --> 443.46]  So those are the famous stories of Exodus.
[443.70 --> 446.00]  And there's a bunch of children's books about this.
[446.10 --> 447.86]  This is, whenever you read a Bible for kids,
[447.94 --> 449.36]  these are the stories that get highlighted.
[449.70 --> 451.08]  And now there's movies on them as well.
[451.62 --> 453.14]  But here's my hunch, and I hope I'm wrong.
[453.22 --> 453.98]  But my hunch is,
[454.40 --> 456.22]  we know there are stories in the book of Exodus
[456.22 --> 458.38]  that are very great to tell your kids.
[459.16 --> 462.10]  But we don't necessarily know how the book of Exodus unfolds.
[462.10 --> 464.12]  We don't know the story of Exodus,
[464.12 --> 465.32]  or why it matters.
[465.32 --> 466.86]  And even more than that,
[467.32 --> 470.00]  we probably don't know very well how it fits with Genesis
[470.00 --> 473.02]  and moves beyond Exodus into the rest of the Old Testament.
[473.94 --> 474.70]  To put it differently,
[475.10 --> 476.44]  when you start reading the book of Exodus,
[476.62 --> 478.22]  you're jumping on a moving train.
[479.38 --> 481.00]  Exodus doesn't make sense without Genesis,
[481.20 --> 482.82]  and the rest of the Old Testament story
[482.82 --> 484.42]  doesn't make sense without Exodus.
[485.10 --> 486.36]  And so what I want to do this morning,
[486.88 --> 488.92]  as briefly as I can, no promises,
[488.92 --> 492.70]  is I want to tell the story that makes sense of this book,
[493.26 --> 496.44]  and then I want to walk us through the whole book together.
[496.56 --> 498.66]  And I hope that that sets us up for understanding
[498.66 --> 501.18]  and going deep together in this book for the rest of the summer.
[501.98 --> 502.80]  Does that sound good?
[503.74 --> 504.44]  You don't have a choice.
[504.50 --> 505.08]  We're doing it anyway.
[507.56 --> 510.14]  It starts, this book, with a list of names.
[511.12 --> 513.08]  And I think if those names don't make sense to you,
[513.12 --> 514.60]  what you have to do is go back to Genesis,
[514.60 --> 518.02]  because it's meant to hang on the whole narrative of Genesis.
[518.20 --> 519.04]  So with your permission,
[519.40 --> 522.04]  I'm going to summarize the whole book of Genesis unapologetically.
[522.94 --> 526.60]  Genesis starts with God creating the entire world.
[527.52 --> 528.52]  He's not a local deity.
[528.68 --> 529.52]  He's not a tribal deity.
[529.68 --> 531.44]  He is the creator of the whole world,
[531.50 --> 534.26]  and he places in his good world humans.
[535.28 --> 537.54]  And they're not just there to serve him or feed him
[537.54 --> 539.68]  like other narratives of the creation accounts.
[540.30 --> 542.60]  They're there to live as his image bearers,
[542.60 --> 546.70]  to cultivate and develop and to enjoy the creation.
[548.06 --> 549.02]  They do that,
[549.54 --> 553.12]  but then they decide they'd rather do it without God in control.
[553.54 --> 555.10]  They basically take the reins and say,
[555.18 --> 556.16]  no, we'll run it from here.
[556.26 --> 558.02]  And as you might know, in Genesis 3,
[558.12 --> 560.46]  this thing enters into the world called sin,
[561.26 --> 563.72]  this undoing of the goodness of the world.
[563.82 --> 567.86]  And Genesis 3 to 11 tells the story of this cancerous virus of sin
[567.86 --> 569.66]  sort of spreading throughout creation.
[569.66 --> 573.22]  Now there's a disruption between humans' relationship with God
[573.22 --> 575.64]  and with other people, with the creation itself,
[575.68 --> 576.86]  and even with ourselves.
[577.82 --> 578.64]  There's pride.
[578.84 --> 579.42]  There's arrogance.
[579.60 --> 580.24]  There's violence.
[580.40 --> 580.82]  There's hate.
[580.94 --> 581.62]  There's distrust.
[581.72 --> 582.36]  There's lying.
[582.74 --> 585.76]  And the story of Genesis 3 moves all the way to Genesis 11,
[586.14 --> 590.66]  basically culminating in the building of a whole city without God.
[591.10 --> 592.50]  Genesis starts with the rebelling,
[592.64 --> 594.98]  or sorry, the sin starts with rebelling against God in the garden,
[594.98 --> 600.44]  and then it moves to the whole city being built in sort of arrogant pride against God.
[600.88 --> 603.36]  And the question that we're left with in Genesis 11 is,
[603.98 --> 605.38]  what's God going to do about this?
[605.52 --> 606.46]  He created the world.
[606.54 --> 607.32]  It was created good.
[607.38 --> 609.40]  Now it's marred by this virus of sin.
[609.48 --> 611.02]  What's his plan now?
[612.06 --> 614.38]  And Genesis 12, he does something that you wouldn't expect.
[615.32 --> 616.44]  At least, that's what I think.
[616.94 --> 618.54]  He doesn't sort of destroy the world
[618.54 --> 620.56]  to just kind of wipe his hands clean of this mess.
[620.88 --> 624.96]  He calls one person, Abraham.
[625.84 --> 628.74]  And he makes four massive promises to Abraham
[628.74 --> 630.16]  that I brought up just a few weeks ago.
[630.24 --> 631.98]  Number one, he says to Abraham,
[632.10 --> 633.10]  I'm going to bless you.
[634.40 --> 637.30]  Number two, I'm going to make your name great.
[638.48 --> 642.36]  Number three, I'm going to make you a great nation.
[642.88 --> 648.00]  And number four, all the nations of the earth will be blessed through you.
[648.92 --> 651.76]  God, in his amazing, sovereign love,
[652.06 --> 655.30]  although he could work out his plan of redemption in all sorts of ways,
[655.50 --> 657.06]  he partners with humans.
[658.08 --> 661.42]  He partners through Abraham and through Abraham to a family
[661.42 --> 664.44]  and through that family to bring his blessing to the ends of the earth.
[665.04 --> 667.36]  That's the roadmap for the whole Old Testament.
[667.84 --> 670.86]  That's really how it starts and what makes sense of the whole book of Exodus.
[671.84 --> 673.40]  So Genesis tells that story.
[673.50 --> 675.56]  Abraham and then Isaac and then Jacob
[675.56 --> 678.16]  and then Jacob's 12 sons, including Joseph.
[678.16 --> 680.96]  And the end of the book of Genesis tells the story of Joseph,
[681.12 --> 681.92]  one of my favorites.
[682.50 --> 685.86]  It's about this punk kid who had a bit of an arrogant stride in him
[685.86 --> 688.52]  and he had these dreams about his brothers bowing down to him
[688.52 --> 690.88]  and he thought it was a good idea to tell his brothers
[690.88 --> 693.24]  that he had this dream of his brothers bowing down to him
[693.24 --> 694.90]  and they took really well to that.
[695.82 --> 696.52]  No, they did not.
[697.32 --> 698.94]  They probably overreacted.
[699.02 --> 699.56]  They said to him,
[699.62 --> 700.34]  if that's what you think,
[700.40 --> 702.82]  we're going to sell you into slavery and tell dad you died.
[702.82 --> 705.62]  That's how Genesis goes with Joseph.
[706.24 --> 707.02]  And as you know the story,
[707.12 --> 708.14]  Joseph goes to Egypt.
[708.92 --> 710.52]  It's where we're introduced to the place of Egypt
[710.52 --> 712.34]  and God's favor is with him.
[712.42 --> 714.56]  God's sovereign love is working through his life
[714.56 --> 716.06]  and actually rises through the ranks.
[716.60 --> 717.90]  And when Egypt has a famine
[717.90 --> 719.34]  and a whole region has a famine,
[719.82 --> 721.88]  who's the person distributing the resources?
[722.82 --> 723.36]  It's Joseph.
[724.12 --> 725.82]  He's able to care for the city of Egypt,
[725.96 --> 726.94]  care for the surrounding regions,
[727.00 --> 728.16]  and it's that very famine
[728.16 --> 730.64]  that brings Joseph's family to Egypt
[730.64 --> 733.66]  so he can feed them and also reconcile with them.
[734.08 --> 736.68]  And that's the reason why Exodus begins
[736.68 --> 738.82]  with the whole family of Israel,
[738.96 --> 740.82]  these 12 brothers and their families,
[741.16 --> 741.86]  settling in Egypt.
[742.44 --> 743.42]  That's where the plot begins.
[743.52 --> 744.28]  But you need to know,
[744.42 --> 745.34]  at the beginning of Exodus,
[745.82 --> 747.50]  this is still far from the promise
[747.50 --> 748.76]  that God made Abraham
[748.76 --> 750.34]  to make him a great nation.
[750.42 --> 751.90]  Right now, they're sort of a small clan
[751.90 --> 752.74]  at the beginning of Exodus
[752.74 --> 754.44]  and they're not in Canaan.
[754.56 --> 756.20]  God promised Abraham and his descendants
[756.20 --> 758.02]  they'd live in this abundant land
[758.02 --> 759.82]  right in the middle of the ancient Near East.
[759.88 --> 761.38]  It would be this thriving place
[761.38 --> 762.52]  where they could show the nations
[762.52 --> 763.34]  the goodness of God.
[763.52 --> 764.92]  But right now, they're settling in Egypt.
[765.06 --> 765.90]  It's not even their homeland.
[768.16 --> 770.20]  And you should know that the story gets worse
[770.20 --> 771.48]  before it gets better.
[771.68 --> 773.28]  You probably got a hint of that as we read it.
[774.08 --> 775.66]  Exodus begins with sort of the favor
[775.66 --> 777.32]  that Joseph had and his family received
[777.32 --> 778.84]  through the king at that time.
[778.92 --> 779.34]  He died.
[779.44 --> 780.80]  The next king looked at these Israelites,
[780.80 --> 783.26]  this clan of these 12 brothers,
[783.74 --> 784.56]  and he felt threatened.
[785.50 --> 786.20]  He looked at them and said,
[786.20 --> 787.92]  they're spreading so numerously,
[788.48 --> 790.36]  you know, like Dutch people in the past.
[791.00 --> 792.52]  I get made fun of for having four kids.
[792.58 --> 793.86]  That's not that big a family, by the way.
[794.04 --> 795.26]  But they're spreading so numerously
[795.26 --> 796.38]  that he felt threatened by them.
[797.06 --> 797.46]  And he said,
[797.50 --> 798.42]  these people are a threat
[798.42 --> 800.32]  because they might rise up against us
[800.32 --> 801.46]  if war breaks out against us.
[801.50 --> 802.54]  And so what we need to do
[802.54 --> 804.10]  is oppress them.
[804.50 --> 806.14]  We need to make sure they're our slaves.
[807.12 --> 808.40]  And so Pharaoh enacted laws
[808.40 --> 811.20]  that made these family members slaves.
[812.02 --> 813.40]  They built the storehouses for Pharaoh.
[813.40 --> 814.78]  They did the hard labor for Pharaoh.
[814.86 --> 816.30]  And the word that you see repeated is,
[816.74 --> 819.36]  they were treated ruthlessly.
[820.78 --> 821.48]  That's serious.
[822.08 --> 823.18]  But that's just the beginning of it
[823.18 --> 824.38]  because what happens next is,
[824.56 --> 826.52]  Pharaoh enacts a law of genocide
[826.52 --> 827.90]  against the Israelites.
[829.06 --> 829.86]  He basically says,
[830.00 --> 832.24]  every time a Hebrew boy is born,
[832.54 --> 833.50]  I want you to kill it.
[833.64 --> 835.28]  Can you just imagine that scene for a minute?
[836.94 --> 838.28]  This is serious stuff.
[838.54 --> 839.54]  And some writers have said
[839.54 --> 840.82]  it's probably just as bad for the girls
[840.82 --> 842.52]  because they get brought into Egyptian households
[842.52 --> 843.40]  with no power
[843.40 --> 844.80]  and people can do with them whatever they want.
[845.54 --> 846.96]  But this is a law of genocide
[846.96 --> 848.62]  from a paranoid leader
[848.62 --> 850.72]  who doesn't want to be having his rule threatened.
[852.00 --> 853.26]  And so just feel the tension.
[853.42 --> 854.98]  At the beginning of the book of Exodus,
[855.52 --> 857.54]  you have the promise that God made to Abraham.
[857.64 --> 858.36]  I'm going to bless you.
[858.46 --> 859.46]  Your name's going to be great.
[859.66 --> 861.02]  I'm going to make you a great nation.
[861.20 --> 862.84]  And all the nations will be blessed through you.
[863.26 --> 865.44]  The reality at the beginning of Exodus is,
[865.66 --> 867.04]  they are a slave nation
[867.04 --> 868.96]  oppressed under the power of Pharaoh
[868.96 --> 872.04]  with children who have a death warrant on their heads.
[873.34 --> 874.48]  And the question is,
[874.84 --> 877.48]  what in the world is God going to do about that?
[878.44 --> 880.10]  And that's where we get to Exodus 2.
[880.16 --> 880.98]  And I want to read for you
[880.98 --> 882.94]  a pretty significant passage in the book of Exodus
[882.94 --> 884.96]  so it sets the narrative forward.
[886.64 --> 888.06]  Exodus 2.23, we read,
[888.06 --> 889.64]  During that long period,
[890.18 --> 891.34]  the king of Egypt died.
[892.10 --> 894.36]  The Israelites groaned in their slavery
[894.36 --> 895.16]  and cried out.
[895.54 --> 896.60]  And the cry for help,
[896.60 --> 897.74]  because of their slavery,
[897.98 --> 899.28]  went up to God.
[900.54 --> 902.36]  God heard their groaning.
[903.20 --> 905.68]  And he remembered his covenant with Abraham,
[905.98 --> 906.70]  with Isaac,
[907.10 --> 907.82]  and with Jacob.
[908.50 --> 909.76]  So God looked on the Israelites
[909.76 --> 912.48]  and was concerned about them.
[916.32 --> 917.62]  God heard the groans
[917.62 --> 919.84]  of this slave nation that he loved.
[920.18 --> 921.60]  He heard their cries,
[921.76 --> 922.84]  and because of their slavery,
[923.08 --> 924.10]  he remembered his covenant.
[924.24 --> 924.88]  And some have said,
[924.88 --> 926.36]  what's the deal with that line?
[926.86 --> 927.80]  He remembered his covenant.
[927.90 --> 929.20]  Did he just forget his covenant?
[929.36 --> 931.10]  It's like sort of a senior citizen moment
[931.10 --> 932.74]  where all of a sudden he calls back into memory
[932.74 --> 934.18]  this covenant he has.
[934.76 --> 935.46]  And I want you to know
[935.46 --> 937.04]  that a better way of reading that
[937.04 --> 939.54]  is God now moving to action
[939.54 --> 940.92]  on that promise.
[941.04 --> 942.00]  Him remembering his covenant
[942.00 --> 942.30]  and saying,
[942.70 --> 943.78]  now I'm going to do something
[943.78 --> 944.58]  about this promise.
[945.02 --> 946.50]  Now I'm going to move against
[946.50 --> 948.28]  those who are threatening the ways
[948.28 --> 949.40]  that I have determined
[949.40 --> 950.14]  for my family,
[950.26 --> 950.82]  for the world.
[950.82 --> 953.88]  And I think at the base of Exodus,
[953.98 --> 955.00]  a really good way to understand
[955.00 --> 955.84]  what's happening here
[955.84 --> 957.82]  is that God's own character
[957.82 --> 958.64]  is at stake.
[959.42 --> 960.02]  It's like when you make
[960.02 --> 961.16]  a big promise to somebody
[961.16 --> 962.38]  and you make a big promise
[962.38 --> 963.00]  about the future,
[963.22 --> 964.40]  if you don't follow through
[964.40 --> 965.00]  on that promise,
[965.08 --> 965.68]  your integrity
[965.68 --> 966.56]  and your character
[966.56 --> 967.28]  is at stake.
[967.80 --> 969.46]  God made enormous promises
[969.46 --> 969.98]  to Abraham
[969.98 --> 970.68]  about his future,
[970.78 --> 971.24]  his family,
[971.32 --> 972.10]  and the nations
[972.10 --> 973.12]  through them.
[973.24 --> 974.20]  And now the question is,
[974.34 --> 975.72]  is God going to make good
[975.72 --> 976.52]  on those promises?
[977.26 --> 978.34]  Does he have the power
[978.34 --> 979.06]  and the ability
[979.06 --> 980.28]  to rescue these slaves,
[980.38 --> 981.04]  to do something
[981.04 --> 981.78]  about their oppression,
[982.12 --> 983.46]  to bring them to the promise
[983.46 --> 984.30]  that he gave to them?
[984.76 --> 985.54]  That's the question.
[987.18 --> 988.66]  And so now I want to walk
[988.66 --> 989.70]  briefly through
[989.70 --> 992.20]  the three major movements
[992.20 --> 993.40]  in the book of Exodus.
[993.50 --> 993.92]  And I hope,
[994.00 --> 994.60]  I really do hope
[994.60 --> 995.36]  that this gives us
[995.36 --> 996.86]  sort of a lens through which
[996.86 --> 997.88]  to walk through this book
[997.88 --> 999.42]  over the next eight weeks.
[1000.90 --> 1002.12]  Exodus 1 to 18
[1002.12 --> 1004.90]  is the story of liberation.
[1006.02 --> 1006.92]  Exodus 1 to 18
[1006.92 --> 1007.74]  tells the story
[1007.74 --> 1009.18]  of God rolling up
[1009.18 --> 1010.06]  his sleeves
[1010.06 --> 1012.14]  and bringing his people
[1012.14 --> 1013.18]  to himself.
[1014.00 --> 1014.46]  And you're going to hear
[1014.46 --> 1015.04]  more about this
[1015.04 --> 1015.72]  in the next few weeks,
[1015.82 --> 1016.60]  but you should see
[1016.60 --> 1017.92]  that Exodus 1 to 18
[1017.92 --> 1018.58]  is about Pharaoh
[1018.58 --> 1019.70]  who sees himself
[1019.70 --> 1020.62]  as a God
[1020.62 --> 1022.66]  and he has Israel
[1022.66 --> 1023.96]  as part of his household
[1023.96 --> 1025.72]  is now being confronted
[1025.72 --> 1027.16]  by the true God
[1027.16 --> 1028.56]  who's going to bring Israel
[1028.56 --> 1029.66]  into his household
[1029.66 --> 1030.40]  as the people
[1030.40 --> 1031.40]  that belong to him.
[1031.60 --> 1032.94]  And it really is
[1032.94 --> 1034.74]  a clash of gods.
[1035.42 --> 1036.52]  It's God showing up
[1036.52 --> 1037.66]  to these Israeli people,
[1037.74 --> 1038.40]  hearing their groans
[1038.40 --> 1039.82]  and confronting Pharaoh
[1039.82 --> 1040.20]  saying,
[1040.42 --> 1042.86]  I am the living God.
[1042.96 --> 1043.16]  In fact,
[1043.20 --> 1044.20]  that's how he tells Moses
[1044.20 --> 1044.88]  to describe him.
[1044.94 --> 1046.62]  He is the I am.
[1047.28 --> 1048.70]  And Pharaoh's going to see
[1048.70 --> 1050.54]  just what kind of God
[1050.54 --> 1051.64]  God is.
[1052.30 --> 1053.52]  When the plagues come,
[1054.28 --> 1055.24]  he gets to witness
[1055.24 --> 1055.90]  the power
[1055.90 --> 1056.64]  and the authority
[1056.64 --> 1057.72]  over the whole of creation
[1057.72 --> 1059.50]  that the living God has.
[1059.62 --> 1060.28]  And Chris Wright,
[1060.62 --> 1061.58]  who's done a lot of writing
[1061.58 --> 1062.36]  on the book of Exodus,
[1062.48 --> 1062.96]  he's a scholar,
[1062.96 --> 1063.48]  he says,
[1063.96 --> 1065.12]  God doesn't play well
[1065.12 --> 1065.86]  in the sandbox
[1065.86 --> 1067.18]  with other gods.
[1068.38 --> 1069.42]  He doesn't play well
[1069.42 --> 1069.92]  in the sandbox
[1069.92 --> 1070.90]  with other gods
[1070.90 --> 1072.14]  who claim to have power
[1072.14 --> 1072.68]  and authority.
[1072.76 --> 1073.36]  And you're going to see
[1073.36 --> 1075.16]  God showing his authority,
[1075.38 --> 1075.92]  his justice,
[1076.12 --> 1076.68]  his judgment,
[1076.90 --> 1078.12]  and his power
[1078.12 --> 1078.76]  as he brings
[1078.76 --> 1079.92]  this little slave nation
[1079.92 --> 1081.10]  through the Red Sea
[1081.10 --> 1082.10]  to himself
[1082.10 --> 1082.94]  at Mount Sinai
[1082.94 --> 1084.26]  and swallows up
[1084.26 --> 1085.32]  the largest army
[1085.32 --> 1086.28]  of the world empire
[1086.28 --> 1086.74]  of the day.
[1087.88 --> 1088.96]  That's the God
[1088.96 --> 1089.96]  Israel has.
[1089.96 --> 1093.06]  The second major section
[1093.06 --> 1093.82]  of Exodus
[1093.82 --> 1096.28]  is chapter 19 to 24.
[1096.48 --> 1097.36]  And this is the section
[1097.36 --> 1098.42]  that's about God
[1098.42 --> 1100.56]  forming a covenant relationship.
[1100.68 --> 1101.18]  And if you don't know
[1101.18 --> 1101.74]  the word covenant,
[1101.86 --> 1102.40]  you're going to hear about
[1102.40 --> 1102.86]  it in the future
[1102.86 --> 1103.90]  because it matters.
[1104.04 --> 1105.76]  God forms a very deep
[1105.76 --> 1107.06]  binding commitment
[1107.06 --> 1107.66]  with them
[1107.66 --> 1109.08]  where he makes promises
[1109.08 --> 1109.58]  to them
[1109.58 --> 1110.48]  and they make promises
[1110.48 --> 1111.02]  to him.
[1111.22 --> 1111.98]  And it's a covenant
[1111.98 --> 1112.68]  of love.
[1113.14 --> 1114.00]  And you should know
[1114.00 --> 1114.82]  that we should read
[1114.82 --> 1115.62]  this whole section
[1115.62 --> 1116.90]  as a contrast again,
[1117.44 --> 1118.84]  Pharaoh to God.
[1118.84 --> 1120.24]  For 400 years,
[1120.34 --> 1120.68]  the Israelites
[1120.68 --> 1121.82]  had a relationship
[1121.82 --> 1123.06]  with a covenant lord
[1123.06 --> 1123.64]  named Pharaoh.
[1123.90 --> 1124.72]  He had rules
[1124.72 --> 1125.40]  that oppressed them.
[1125.46 --> 1126.14]  He had laws
[1126.14 --> 1127.22]  that benefited Egyptians.
[1127.54 --> 1128.12]  They had all sorts
[1128.12 --> 1128.60]  of worship
[1128.60 --> 1129.30]  and a worldview
[1129.30 --> 1129.88]  that they had been
[1129.88 --> 1130.48]  steeped in.
[1130.76 --> 1131.42]  And now,
[1132.04 --> 1132.70]  they've been rescued
[1132.70 --> 1133.12]  by God.
[1133.18 --> 1133.94]  They get to learn
[1133.94 --> 1134.86]  how to live
[1134.86 --> 1135.52]  with this God,
[1136.20 --> 1137.58]  how to be his people,
[1137.76 --> 1138.72]  how to belong to him,
[1138.78 --> 1140.12]  what rules to live by.
[1140.34 --> 1141.08]  And you need to see
[1141.08 --> 1142.18]  that these ten commandments
[1142.18 --> 1143.40]  and the other instructions
[1143.40 --> 1144.50]  are God saying,
[1144.64 --> 1145.60]  I'm not like Pharaoh.
[1146.58 --> 1147.40]  I've got laws
[1147.40 --> 1148.74]  that will bless you.
[1149.12 --> 1149.82]  They're going to protect
[1149.82 --> 1150.42]  your families.
[1150.52 --> 1151.00]  They're going to protect
[1151.00 --> 1151.56]  your marriages.
[1151.68 --> 1152.18]  They're going to protect
[1152.18 --> 1153.02]  your whole city.
[1153.18 --> 1153.92]  And it's going to lead
[1153.92 --> 1155.90]  to shalom under my rule
[1155.90 --> 1156.50]  as you live out
[1156.50 --> 1157.48]  my instructions
[1157.48 --> 1159.32]  over and against Pharaoh's.
[1160.82 --> 1161.42]  And of course,
[1161.50 --> 1161.82]  the image,
[1161.88 --> 1162.58]  and I want you to know
[1162.58 --> 1163.96]  that when God gives
[1163.96 --> 1164.58]  these instructions
[1164.58 --> 1166.38]  and they live these out
[1166.38 --> 1167.00]  when they receive
[1167.00 --> 1167.80]  the land of Canaan,
[1168.34 --> 1169.86]  the idea is that
[1169.86 --> 1170.68]  and the plan is that
[1170.68 --> 1171.48]  when they live in Canaan,
[1171.58 --> 1172.36]  which is not just
[1172.36 --> 1173.00]  an abundant land,
[1173.04 --> 1174.44]  but it's also like central
[1174.44 --> 1175.98]  to the whole ancient Near East,
[1176.06 --> 1176.98]  they're right in the middle
[1176.98 --> 1177.60]  of everything.
[1177.60 --> 1178.78]  The idea is that
[1178.78 --> 1180.96]  the nations who surround Israel
[1180.96 --> 1182.92]  will see the way Israel
[1182.92 --> 1184.42]  lives under God's laws.
[1184.98 --> 1186.38]  They'll see the families,
[1186.52 --> 1187.52]  they'll see the shalom,
[1187.62 --> 1188.46]  they'll see the peace,
[1188.70 --> 1189.54]  they'll see the presence
[1189.54 --> 1189.96]  of God,
[1190.02 --> 1190.56]  and they'll say,
[1191.40 --> 1191.76]  wow,
[1192.44 --> 1194.60]  what kind of nation is this?
[1194.62 --> 1195.58]  That's what Deuteronomy 4
[1195.58 --> 1195.84]  is saying.
[1196.06 --> 1196.90]  What kind of nation
[1196.90 --> 1198.42]  has these kinds of just laws?
[1198.64 --> 1199.60]  What kind of nation
[1199.60 --> 1201.28]  protects the vulnerable?
[1201.62 --> 1202.76]  What kind of laws
[1202.76 --> 1203.30]  do they have?
[1203.30 --> 1204.92]  Who instituted these?
[1205.32 --> 1206.36]  And the Israelites can say,
[1206.78 --> 1207.88]  welcome to life
[1207.88 --> 1209.88]  under the living God.
[1211.02 --> 1212.38]  That's the second section.
[1212.84 --> 1213.84]  The final section,
[1213.94 --> 1215.02]  chapter 25 to 40,
[1215.06 --> 1216.00]  is probably the least known.
[1216.08 --> 1217.22]  This never shows up
[1217.22 --> 1218.60]  in the children's Bible storybooks.
[1219.00 --> 1219.88]  Does that frustrate me?
[1220.04 --> 1220.42]  Yes.
[1221.42 --> 1222.28]  This is a section
[1222.28 --> 1222.82]  on the building
[1222.82 --> 1223.66]  of the tabernacle,
[1224.04 --> 1224.82]  and it's all about
[1224.82 --> 1225.58]  God's presence
[1225.58 --> 1226.20]  in the community.
[1226.36 --> 1227.72]  They learn to worship God.
[1227.80 --> 1228.52]  It's all about God
[1228.52 --> 1229.72]  coming to live
[1229.72 --> 1230.60]  right in the center
[1230.60 --> 1231.16]  of their camp.
[1231.16 --> 1232.30]  How to do worship,
[1232.44 --> 1232.98]  the things that are
[1232.98 --> 1233.98]  in the tabernacle,
[1234.22 --> 1235.28]  and this is all about
[1235.28 --> 1235.72]  the community
[1235.72 --> 1236.72]  learning how to worship
[1236.72 --> 1238.22]  and live in the presence
[1238.22 --> 1240.16]  of a holy God.
[1240.98 --> 1242.72]  We have so much to learn
[1242.72 --> 1243.42]  in this section,
[1243.50 --> 1243.90]  and it's actually
[1243.90 --> 1244.98]  a beautiful conclusion.
[1245.80 --> 1247.48]  Exodus 40 literally finishes
[1247.48 --> 1248.94]  with the glory of God
[1248.94 --> 1250.24]  hovering over the tabernacle,
[1250.74 --> 1252.74]  then descending to fill it.
[1253.22 --> 1254.62]  And in a very real sense,
[1254.72 --> 1256.22]  God moves into the neighborhood.
[1256.72 --> 1258.04]  He gets a postal code
[1258.04 --> 1259.00]  in Israel.
[1259.00 --> 1260.98]  They get to gather around
[1260.98 --> 1262.18]  His presence in the community,
[1262.34 --> 1263.50]  and through them,
[1264.00 --> 1265.32]  the nations get to taste
[1265.32 --> 1266.56]  the presence of God.
[1267.28 --> 1268.00]  So liberation,
[1268.22 --> 1269.22]  chapter 1 to 18,
[1269.66 --> 1270.82]  covenant relationship,
[1271.00 --> 1272.24]  chapter 19 to 24,
[1272.54 --> 1274.68]  and then living in His presence,
[1275.48 --> 1276.74]  chapter 25 to 40.
[1277.58 --> 1278.34]  Is that helpful?
[1278.44 --> 1279.62]  Sort of the bird's eye view
[1279.62 --> 1280.56]  of Exodus.
[1281.16 --> 1282.42]  One person's nodding their head.
[1282.48 --> 1282.90]  There we go.
[1284.18 --> 1285.10]  One out of 50.
[1285.20 --> 1285.72]  I don't want to do
[1285.72 --> 1286.54]  the numbers on that.
[1286.54 --> 1289.34]  For the rest of the time I have,
[1289.42 --> 1290.58]  I want to focus on one thing
[1290.58 --> 1291.48]  that threads its way
[1291.48 --> 1292.50]  through the book of Exodus.
[1293.34 --> 1294.66]  And I think this is a helpful lens
[1294.66 --> 1296.36]  for us to read this whole book with.
[1297.06 --> 1297.84]  And that is
[1297.84 --> 1299.84]  the people learning
[1299.84 --> 1301.16]  about the character
[1301.16 --> 1302.20]  and the purpose of God.
[1302.88 --> 1304.18]  You need to see the Israelites
[1304.18 --> 1304.90]  not as the people
[1304.90 --> 1305.66]  that knew God
[1305.66 --> 1306.52]  or knew His purposes
[1306.52 --> 1307.04]  or understood
[1307.04 --> 1308.12]  what He was trying to do.
[1308.40 --> 1310.04]  They had spent 400 years
[1310.04 --> 1310.60]  in Egypt.
[1311.02 --> 1312.26]  400 years in oppression,
[1312.46 --> 1314.16]  400 years in the Egyptian story,
[1314.24 --> 1315.02]  the Egyptian gods,
[1315.14 --> 1316.28]  the Egyptian way of life.
[1316.28 --> 1319.14]  They did not know God.
[1319.94 --> 1321.42]  And this story is really
[1321.42 --> 1322.82]  all about the Israelites,
[1323.04 --> 1323.86]  the covenant people,
[1324.52 --> 1325.70]  learning about God,
[1326.34 --> 1327.54]  learning about His character,
[1327.72 --> 1328.70]  learning why in the world
[1328.70 --> 1329.50]  He cares about them,
[1329.58 --> 1330.48]  why He's redeeming them,
[1330.52 --> 1331.90]  what He wants to do through them.
[1332.44 --> 1334.36]  They have to learn about God.
[1334.86 --> 1335.80]  And I want you to sort of
[1335.80 --> 1336.52]  place yourself
[1336.52 --> 1337.34]  in the sandals
[1337.34 --> 1338.26]  of the Israelites
[1338.26 --> 1340.34]  to understand the story
[1340.34 --> 1341.26]  of them coming to terms
[1341.26 --> 1342.24]  with this holy God
[1342.24 --> 1342.92]  who has the power
[1342.92 --> 1343.62]  to send plagues
[1343.62 --> 1346.00]  and bring part of the Red Sea
[1346.00 --> 1346.80]  and bring these people
[1346.80 --> 1347.52]  to give them instruction.
[1347.66 --> 1348.88]  Who is this God?
[1349.62 --> 1350.34]  And you'll see that
[1350.34 --> 1351.80]  He gives names for Himself.
[1352.82 --> 1353.52]  He says to Moses,
[1353.64 --> 1354.56]  when you confront Pharaoh
[1354.56 --> 1354.92]  and say,
[1355.04 --> 1355.78]  let my people go,
[1356.18 --> 1356.80]  tell Pharaoh
[1356.80 --> 1358.44]  that I am
[1358.44 --> 1359.48]  has sent you.
[1360.48 --> 1361.38]  And there's a lot of discussion.
[1361.48 --> 1362.44]  I'll come back to this next week
[1362.44 --> 1363.80]  on what God means
[1363.80 --> 1364.20]  when He says,
[1364.44 --> 1364.68]  I am,
[1364.72 --> 1365.12]  but it's probably
[1365.12 --> 1366.20]  I am who I am
[1366.20 --> 1366.98]  or I will be
[1366.98 --> 1367.78]  who I will be.
[1367.90 --> 1369.30]  I will reveal Myself
[1369.30 --> 1370.46]  to you
[1370.46 --> 1371.90]  in all My glory and power.
[1372.90 --> 1373.54]  And then in Genesis
[1373.54 --> 1374.32]  or later in Exodus
[1374.32 --> 1375.40]  you see Him revealing Himself
[1375.40 --> 1376.60]  as the Goel
[1376.60 --> 1378.00]  which is the Redeemer.
[1378.94 --> 1379.62]  They need to see
[1379.62 --> 1380.18]  that this God
[1380.18 --> 1380.92]  is not just a God
[1380.92 --> 1382.24]  who rules sovereignly
[1382.24 --> 1382.76]  at a distance.
[1382.86 --> 1384.58]  He actually stretches out His arm
[1384.58 --> 1386.28]  and He rescues people.
[1386.98 --> 1388.34]  That's the character of God.
[1388.46 --> 1388.82]  And the Israelites
[1388.82 --> 1389.74]  over and over again
[1389.74 --> 1390.14]  have to realize
[1390.14 --> 1391.64]  that this is not just a God,
[1391.74 --> 1393.24]  it's their God.
[1393.92 --> 1394.44]  It's the God
[1394.44 --> 1396.22]  who binds Himself to them,
[1396.22 --> 1397.86]  who loves them
[1397.86 --> 1398.92]  and wants to use them
[1398.92 --> 1399.62]  to bring His blessing
[1399.62 --> 1400.20]  to the world.
[1400.94 --> 1401.70]  They have to learn
[1401.70 --> 1402.68]  about their God.
[1404.36 --> 1405.58]  I want to read a quote
[1405.58 --> 1405.88]  for you
[1405.88 --> 1406.62]  that comes from
[1406.62 --> 1407.42]  my brother-in-law
[1407.42 --> 1408.14]  Mark Glanville.
[1408.88 --> 1409.56]  It's very handy
[1409.56 --> 1410.48]  to have some scholars
[1410.48 --> 1411.20]  in my family.
[1411.40 --> 1412.60]  It's very strange to me
[1412.60 --> 1413.64]  to study the book of Exodus
[1413.64 --> 1414.86]  and be reading commentaries
[1414.86 --> 1415.96]  by family members.
[1416.06 --> 1416.68]  The only problem is
[1416.68 --> 1417.40]  if you disagree
[1417.40 --> 1418.62]  then it creates conflict
[1418.62 --> 1419.22]  in the family.
[1420.48 --> 1421.48]  This is a quote
[1421.48 --> 1422.22]  that he has
[1422.22 --> 1423.56]  on God's character
[1423.56 --> 1424.26]  and I just find
[1424.26 --> 1425.40]  it summarizes the book well
[1425.40 --> 1426.10]  and it highlights
[1426.10 --> 1426.96]  just the incredible,
[1427.30 --> 1428.54]  loving, powerful character
[1428.54 --> 1429.04]  of God.
[1429.14 --> 1429.60]  He writes,
[1430.42 --> 1432.36]  Yahweh hears the cry
[1432.36 --> 1433.78]  of the oppressed Israelites.
[1434.98 --> 1436.40]  Yahweh holds Pharaoh
[1436.40 --> 1437.04]  to account
[1437.04 --> 1438.26]  for his oppressive rule,
[1438.78 --> 1440.34]  miraculously emancipating
[1440.34 --> 1441.52]  the nation of slaves.
[1442.02 --> 1442.66]  In the crucible
[1442.66 --> 1443.26]  of the desert
[1443.26 --> 1444.34]  they learn to trust
[1444.34 --> 1445.08]  in Yahweh
[1445.08 --> 1446.70]  for every new day.
[1447.32 --> 1447.96]  When they arrive
[1447.96 --> 1448.64]  at Mount Sinai
[1448.64 --> 1449.82]  the experience of slavery
[1449.82 --> 1450.60]  is still raw,
[1450.76 --> 1451.20]  the wounds
[1451.20 --> 1452.12]  of the Egyptian whips
[1452.12 --> 1452.86]  still weep
[1452.86 --> 1453.68]  and the horror
[1453.68 --> 1454.26]  of genocide
[1454.26 --> 1455.82]  is agonizingly fresh.
[1456.78 --> 1457.66]  At Sinai
[1457.66 --> 1458.82]  Yahweh
[1458.82 --> 1460.02]  enfolds Israel
[1460.02 --> 1460.70]  with a covenant
[1460.70 --> 1461.30]  of love,
[1461.64 --> 1462.36]  a relationship
[1462.36 --> 1463.22]  of solidarity
[1463.22 --> 1464.16]  and love.
[1465.38 --> 1465.74]  Yahweh
[1465.74 --> 1466.66]  give laws
[1466.66 --> 1467.90]  in order to shape
[1467.90 --> 1468.42]  the people
[1468.42 --> 1469.52]  into a community
[1469.52 --> 1470.60]  where every member
[1470.60 --> 1471.24]  can flourish
[1471.24 --> 1471.98]  especially
[1471.98 --> 1473.36]  the most vulnerable.
[1474.22 --> 1474.56]  There are to be
[1474.56 --> 1475.36]  no pharaohs
[1475.36 --> 1476.64]  in Yahweh's society.
[1477.14 --> 1478.02]  Accumulation of wealth
[1478.02 --> 1479.22]  and self-aggrandizement
[1479.22 --> 1480.40]  are expressly forbidden.
[1481.18 --> 1482.10]  Israel is to be
[1482.10 --> 1482.60]  a community
[1482.60 --> 1483.64]  of mutual care
[1483.64 --> 1485.28]  of shared life
[1485.28 --> 1486.72]  as kindred.
[1489.46 --> 1490.64]  So pay attention
[1490.64 --> 1491.14]  church
[1491.14 --> 1492.98]  over the next few weeks
[1492.98 --> 1494.56]  of what we're learning
[1494.56 --> 1495.18]  about the character
[1495.18 --> 1496.50]  and the purpose
[1496.50 --> 1497.02]  of God.
[1498.08 --> 1498.86]  And as we journal
[1498.86 --> 1499.24]  and I know
[1499.24 --> 1499.90]  a number of you journal
[1499.90 --> 1500.42]  as we read
[1500.42 --> 1501.04]  through the sermons
[1501.04 --> 1502.12]  or read through this book
[1502.12 --> 1503.28]  just pay attention
[1503.28 --> 1504.16]  to what we need
[1504.16 --> 1504.72]  to learn
[1504.72 --> 1506.12]  today
[1506.12 --> 1507.26]  from Exodus
[1507.26 --> 1508.54]  about the character
[1508.54 --> 1509.24]  of our God.
[1510.40 --> 1512.62]  Now if you know
[1512.62 --> 1513.26]  the story
[1513.26 --> 1514.02]  of the Old Testament
[1514.02 --> 1514.78]  even a little bit
[1514.78 --> 1515.08]  you'll know
[1515.08 --> 1515.68]  it's not a happily
[1515.68 --> 1516.76]  ever after story.
[1517.54 --> 1517.90]  In fact
[1517.90 --> 1518.72]  there are times
[1518.72 --> 1519.10]  when I read
[1519.10 --> 1519.62]  the Old Testament
[1519.62 --> 1520.26]  I find it
[1520.26 --> 1521.62]  such a frustrating story.
[1522.60 --> 1523.58]  There's the community
[1523.58 --> 1524.38]  that gets rescued
[1524.38 --> 1524.92]  by God
[1524.92 --> 1525.42]  in one of the most
[1525.42 --> 1526.66]  amazing acts
[1526.66 --> 1527.32]  of deliverance
[1527.32 --> 1528.00]  and power ever
[1528.00 --> 1529.00]  and what are they doing
[1529.00 --> 1529.94]  even within
[1529.94 --> 1530.70]  the book of Exodus?
[1531.96 --> 1532.68]  They're building
[1532.68 --> 1533.80]  a little golden calf
[1533.80 --> 1535.26]  and worshiping it.
[1536.30 --> 1537.12]  What are they doing
[1537.12 --> 1538.06]  after the book of Exodus?
[1538.40 --> 1539.10]  They're chasing
[1539.10 --> 1540.08]  after other gods
[1540.08 --> 1540.86]  from other nations
[1540.86 --> 1541.74]  that can't speak
[1541.74 --> 1542.96]  that can't act
[1542.96 --> 1544.10]  that can't save
[1544.10 --> 1545.76]  they're constantly
[1545.76 --> 1547.08]  rebelling against
[1547.08 --> 1548.36]  this loving Savior
[1548.36 --> 1550.08]  and they're choosing
[1550.08 --> 1551.06]  the way of the nations
[1551.06 --> 1552.26]  rather than living out
[1552.26 --> 1553.76]  God's loving instruction
[1553.76 --> 1555.16]  before the nations.
[1555.66 --> 1556.00]  And you know
[1556.00 --> 1556.94]  what happens in the end?
[1557.60 --> 1559.16]  They actually choose slavery.
[1559.94 --> 1561.40]  They choose to go back
[1561.40 --> 1562.40]  to oppression
[1562.40 --> 1563.34]  and God lets them
[1563.34 --> 1564.42]  be captured again
[1564.42 --> 1565.22]  and it's a return
[1565.22 --> 1565.90]  all over
[1565.90 --> 1567.14]  to another nation
[1567.14 --> 1568.34]  just like Egypt
[1568.34 --> 1570.24]  and they chose it
[1570.24 --> 1571.44]  by sin.
[1572.76 --> 1573.64]  The end of the Old Testament
[1573.64 --> 1574.38]  leaves us wondering
[1574.38 --> 1575.42]  what's God
[1575.42 --> 1576.28]  going to do now?
[1576.68 --> 1577.66]  The rescue plan
[1577.66 --> 1578.84]  the gospel of the Old Testament
[1578.84 --> 1579.64]  was the Exodus
[1579.64 --> 1581.00]  that was his formation
[1581.00 --> 1581.52]  of a people
[1581.52 --> 1582.30]  that was instruction
[1582.30 --> 1583.04]  he was going to give them
[1583.04 --> 1583.40]  the land
[1583.40 --> 1584.52]  now they get booted
[1584.52 --> 1585.28]  off the land
[1585.28 --> 1586.40]  they've been rebelling
[1586.40 --> 1586.98]  against God
[1586.98 --> 1587.50]  and they're back
[1587.50 --> 1588.40]  to a form of slavery
[1588.40 --> 1590.06]  what's the plan now?
[1590.06 --> 1592.82]  And that's where we get
[1592.82 --> 1594.06]  the gospel
[1594.06 --> 1596.38]  where God does not
[1596.38 --> 1597.24]  turn his face away
[1597.24 --> 1598.00]  from this mess
[1598.00 --> 1599.14]  this sinful world
[1599.14 --> 1599.76]  that not only
[1599.76 --> 1600.60]  mars the nations
[1600.60 --> 1601.72]  but his own people Israel
[1601.72 --> 1603.84]  he moves
[1603.84 --> 1604.74]  into the neighborhood
[1604.74 --> 1605.62]  again
[1605.62 --> 1607.82]  he dwells
[1607.82 --> 1608.94]  among his people again
[1608.94 --> 1609.46]  and this time
[1609.46 --> 1610.56]  he takes on flesh
[1610.56 --> 1612.20]  this time
[1612.20 --> 1612.84]  he's living
[1612.84 --> 1613.70]  speaking
[1613.70 --> 1614.58]  and breathing
[1614.58 --> 1615.70]  as a human
[1615.70 --> 1617.06]  it's Jesus
[1617.06 --> 1618.96]  and Jesus
[1618.96 --> 1619.46]  does
[1619.46 --> 1620.38]  what people
[1620.38 --> 1621.02]  don't understand
[1621.02 --> 1621.36]  at first
[1621.36 --> 1621.72]  he starts
[1621.72 --> 1622.32]  gathering
[1622.32 --> 1623.92]  twelve followers
[1623.92 --> 1626.44]  the new tribe
[1626.44 --> 1627.10]  of Israel
[1627.10 --> 1628.20]  and he starts
[1628.20 --> 1628.90]  teaching them
[1628.90 --> 1629.70]  about the ways
[1629.70 --> 1630.08]  of God
[1630.08 --> 1631.14]  he starts instructing
[1631.14 --> 1632.36]  them on God's desire
[1632.36 --> 1633.08]  for a city
[1633.08 --> 1633.74]  and a nation
[1633.74 --> 1634.32]  and families
[1634.32 --> 1635.08]  that can flourish
[1635.08 --> 1636.40]  in the Sermon on the Mount
[1636.40 --> 1637.80]  he's giving them
[1637.80 --> 1639.06]  the new law
[1639.06 --> 1640.14]  and he keeps
[1640.14 --> 1640.80]  telling people
[1640.80 --> 1641.64]  in different ways
[1641.64 --> 1643.46]  the rescue is coming
[1643.46 --> 1645.16]  the liberation
[1645.16 --> 1645.82]  is coming
[1645.82 --> 1646.92]  a new exodus
[1646.92 --> 1647.66]  you might say
[1647.66 --> 1648.16]  is coming
[1648.16 --> 1649.00]  and they wonder
[1649.00 --> 1649.68]  will Jesus
[1649.68 --> 1651.04]  do what God
[1651.04 --> 1652.00]  did in the exodus
[1652.00 --> 1652.44]  again
[1652.44 --> 1653.68]  will he overthrow
[1653.68 --> 1654.68]  the Roman city
[1654.68 --> 1655.94]  will he show his power
[1655.94 --> 1657.22]  will he send the plagues
[1657.22 --> 1657.78]  to Rome
[1657.78 --> 1660.00]  and they're stunned
[1660.00 --> 1661.88]  when God's just
[1661.88 --> 1662.38]  judgment
[1662.38 --> 1663.76]  finally does come
[1663.76 --> 1664.98]  and it lands
[1664.98 --> 1665.90]  not on the Caesar
[1665.90 --> 1668.12]  but on Jesus
[1668.12 --> 1670.94]  they're stunned
[1670.94 --> 1671.70]  when they realize
[1671.70 --> 1672.38]  that that's where
[1672.38 --> 1672.84]  justice
[1672.84 --> 1673.54]  and judgment
[1673.54 --> 1673.92]  come
[1673.92 --> 1674.66]  why
[1674.66 --> 1676.84]  because that's
[1676.84 --> 1677.62]  how the deeper
[1677.62 --> 1678.36]  liberation
[1678.36 --> 1679.56]  comes to be
[1679.56 --> 1681.48]  that's how people
[1681.48 --> 1681.90]  are rescued
[1681.90 --> 1682.82]  not just from one
[1682.82 --> 1683.74]  oppressive ruler
[1683.74 --> 1685.02]  but from the great
[1685.02 --> 1686.04]  oppressive ruler
[1686.04 --> 1686.84]  and that is Satan
[1686.84 --> 1688.16]  that's how people
[1688.16 --> 1688.64]  get liberated
[1688.64 --> 1689.86]  not just from one place
[1689.86 --> 1690.98]  but from the very
[1690.98 --> 1692.12]  corrupting power
[1692.12 --> 1692.50]  of sin
[1692.50 --> 1693.22]  that cuts through
[1693.22 --> 1693.94]  every single
[1693.94 --> 1694.64]  human heart
[1694.64 --> 1696.90]  it's the cross
[1696.90 --> 1697.94]  the death
[1697.94 --> 1698.40]  and resurrection
[1698.40 --> 1698.96]  of Jesus
[1698.96 --> 1700.34]  that actually
[1700.34 --> 1701.16]  sets
[1701.16 --> 1702.10]  people
[1702.10 --> 1703.04]  free
[1703.04 --> 1705.22]  do you know
[1705.22 --> 1705.86]  that church
[1705.86 --> 1708.42]  the cross
[1708.42 --> 1709.50]  is our
[1709.50 --> 1710.24]  liberation
[1710.24 --> 1711.38]  this is
[1711.38 --> 1712.50]  our exodus
[1712.50 --> 1713.60]  and Jesus
[1713.60 --> 1714.22]  doesn't just
[1714.22 --> 1715.44]  place his church
[1715.44 --> 1716.90]  in one place
[1716.90 --> 1717.58]  in the ancient
[1717.58 --> 1717.96]  near east
[1717.96 --> 1718.36]  to sort of
[1718.36 --> 1719.36]  live out the blessing
[1719.36 --> 1720.46]  Jesus sends the church
[1720.46 --> 1721.00]  to the ends
[1721.00 --> 1721.54]  of the earth
[1721.54 --> 1722.66]  and his promise
[1722.66 --> 1723.08]  to the church
[1723.08 --> 1723.60]  is you will
[1723.60 --> 1724.10]  inherit
[1724.10 --> 1725.34]  the whole earth
[1725.34 --> 1726.14]  not just Canaan
[1726.14 --> 1727.96]  he doesn't want
[1727.96 --> 1728.22]  the people
[1728.22 --> 1729.02]  to stay in one place
[1729.02 --> 1729.64]  he sends them
[1729.64 --> 1730.32]  not in their own
[1730.32 --> 1730.74]  strength
[1730.74 --> 1731.72]  but with his
[1731.72 --> 1732.74]  very indwelling
[1732.74 --> 1734.22]  power and presence
[1734.22 --> 1735.46]  by the Holy Spirit
[1735.46 --> 1736.32]  the Spirit
[1736.32 --> 1736.88]  is not just
[1736.88 --> 1737.72]  in a tabernacle
[1737.72 --> 1739.54]  at one fixed address
[1739.54 --> 1740.44]  the Spirit
[1740.44 --> 1741.68]  is in the people
[1741.68 --> 1742.24]  of God
[1742.24 --> 1743.60]  the Spirit
[1743.60 --> 1744.08]  is in the very
[1744.08 --> 1744.98]  family we just
[1744.98 --> 1746.06]  baptized Paige
[1746.06 --> 1746.50]  into
[1746.50 --> 1750.88]  that's our story
[1750.88 --> 1753.54]  and until Jesus
[1753.54 --> 1754.60]  returns in glory
[1754.60 --> 1755.08]  and power
[1755.08 --> 1755.56]  to heal
[1755.56 --> 1756.44]  his whole creation
[1756.44 --> 1757.98]  we are sent
[1757.98 --> 1758.80]  to live
[1758.80 --> 1760.20]  in our freedom
[1760.20 --> 1762.90]  we need to learn
[1762.90 --> 1763.40]  how to be like
[1763.40 --> 1764.20]  good Hungarians
[1764.20 --> 1765.28]  who know how
[1765.28 --> 1766.24]  to tell our story
[1766.24 --> 1767.98]  such that when
[1767.98 --> 1768.70]  you meet us
[1768.70 --> 1769.78]  we can't help
[1769.78 --> 1770.22]  but tell you
[1770.22 --> 1770.72]  how we've been
[1770.72 --> 1771.96]  rescued from slavery
[1771.96 --> 1772.98]  through the cross
[1772.98 --> 1773.40]  of Jesus
[1773.40 --> 1774.02]  how we've been
[1774.02 --> 1775.16]  filled with the Spirit
[1775.16 --> 1776.22]  and we can now
[1776.22 --> 1777.72]  live out the good
[1777.72 --> 1778.90]  instruction of God
[1778.90 --> 1780.02]  that leads to the
[1780.02 --> 1780.76]  flourishing not just
[1780.76 --> 1781.56]  of our own church
[1781.56 --> 1782.02]  family
[1782.02 --> 1783.34]  or own families
[1783.34 --> 1784.70]  but to the city
[1784.70 --> 1787.08]  that's our story
[1787.08 --> 1791.26]  I want to finish
[1791.26 --> 1792.14]  Melanie and Dan
[1792.14 --> 1793.14]  I see we lost Dan
[1793.14 --> 1793.70]  and your children
[1793.70 --> 1794.50]  it's just you Melanie
[1794.50 --> 1795.00]  I'm just going to
[1795.00 --> 1795.72]  instruct you now
[1795.72 --> 1798.08]  if everything
[1798.08 --> 1799.06]  we've just looked at
[1799.06 --> 1799.70]  in this book
[1799.70 --> 1800.22]  is true
[1800.22 --> 1801.96]  and if this story
[1801.96 --> 1803.34]  really is our story
[1803.34 --> 1805.28]  we don't just have
[1805.28 --> 1805.98]  a responsibility
[1805.98 --> 1807.00]  to tell our friends
[1807.00 --> 1807.60]  and our neighbors
[1807.60 --> 1808.44]  and our workplaces
[1808.44 --> 1810.30]  but to tell our kids
[1810.30 --> 1812.68]  we have a holy
[1812.68 --> 1813.82]  sacred responsibility
[1813.82 --> 1815.68]  to steep our children
[1815.68 --> 1817.62]  in this story
[1817.62 --> 1820.48]  some of the major
[1820.48 --> 1821.20]  challenges
[1821.20 --> 1822.54]  for Israel
[1822.54 --> 1823.58]  when they finally
[1823.58 --> 1824.38]  got to Canaan
[1824.38 --> 1825.20]  they finally got
[1825.20 --> 1826.30]  to that promised land
[1826.30 --> 1827.50]  the warning God
[1827.50 --> 1828.48]  gives Israel is
[1828.48 --> 1829.22]  when you get to
[1829.22 --> 1829.98]  this abundant land
[1829.98 --> 1830.98]  this beautiful place
[1830.98 --> 1832.54]  this prosperous place
[1832.54 --> 1833.74]  you're going to get
[1833.74 --> 1834.78]  comfortable
[1834.78 --> 1837.00]  and you're going to
[1837.00 --> 1837.82]  forget
[1837.82 --> 1839.36]  my love
[1839.36 --> 1840.56]  my goodness
[1840.56 --> 1841.64]  and my presence
[1841.64 --> 1843.48]  and you're going to
[1843.48 --> 1844.66]  fail to tell your
[1844.66 --> 1845.28]  children
[1845.28 --> 1847.72]  who did
[1847.72 --> 1848.98]  all of it
[1848.98 --> 1850.02]  you're going to
[1850.02 --> 1850.76]  forget to tell your
[1850.76 --> 1851.86]  children the mighty
[1851.86 --> 1853.12]  acts of God
[1853.12 --> 1853.88]  and so the
[1853.88 --> 1855.16]  instruction in
[1855.16 --> 1855.78]  Deuteronomy is
[1855.78 --> 1857.26]  tell your
[1857.26 --> 1858.10]  children
[1858.10 --> 1859.38]  the story
[1859.38 --> 1861.22]  in fact one person
[1861.22 --> 1861.98]  who's not even a believer
[1861.98 --> 1862.90]  when asked why the
[1862.90 --> 1863.44]  church is shrinking
[1863.44 --> 1863.86]  in the west
[1863.86 --> 1864.84]  he said it's easy
[1864.84 --> 1865.78]  to answer that question
[1865.78 --> 1867.46]  Christians are not
[1867.46 --> 1868.80]  telling their children
[1868.80 --> 1870.16]  the story
[1870.16 --> 1870.94]  of the scriptures
[1870.94 --> 1872.60]  these children don't
[1872.60 --> 1873.24]  know the mighty
[1873.24 --> 1873.78]  acts of God
[1873.78 --> 1874.34]  they don't know
[1874.34 --> 1874.82]  what he did in
[1874.82 --> 1875.08]  Exodus
[1875.08 --> 1875.60]  they don't know
[1875.60 --> 1875.88]  what he did
[1875.88 --> 1876.14]  through the Old
[1876.14 --> 1876.36]  Testament
[1876.36 --> 1877.06]  and they don't
[1877.06 --> 1877.90]  know what he did
[1877.90 --> 1878.60]  by the cross
[1878.60 --> 1879.04]  of Jesus
[1879.04 --> 1880.60]  and the responsibility
[1880.60 --> 1881.66]  of us as parents
[1881.66 --> 1882.28]  and not just as
[1882.28 --> 1883.10]  parents but as a
[1883.10 --> 1883.82]  church family
[1883.82 --> 1885.68]  is to tell the
[1885.68 --> 1886.62]  next generation
[1886.62 --> 1887.78]  the mighty
[1887.78 --> 1889.06]  acts of God
[1889.06 --> 1891.26]  that's our task
[1891.26 --> 1892.52]  and my prayer
[1892.52 --> 1893.00]  for the last
[1893.00 --> 1893.70]  number of years
[1893.70 --> 1894.58]  even before I came
[1894.58 --> 1894.92]  to Hope
[1894.92 --> 1895.90]  was not only that
[1895.90 --> 1896.42]  our children would
[1896.42 --> 1897.34]  know the story
[1897.34 --> 1898.78]  but they would
[1898.78 --> 1899.64]  live more
[1899.64 --> 1900.92]  faithfully in it
[1900.92 --> 1902.04]  than we are
[1902.04 --> 1903.24]  that they would
[1903.24 --> 1904.02]  take up the mantle
[1904.02 --> 1904.38]  of faith
[1904.38 --> 1904.92]  they would follow
[1904.92 --> 1905.22]  Jesus
[1905.22 --> 1905.82]  and they would
[1905.82 --> 1906.72]  be even more
[1906.72 --> 1907.54]  faithful in
[1907.54 --> 1908.04]  post-Christian
[1908.04 --> 1908.68]  secular British
[1908.68 --> 1908.98]  Columbia
[1908.98 --> 1909.80]  than we are
[1909.80 --> 1910.38]  right now
[1910.38 --> 1911.74]  that's my prayer
[1911.74 --> 1912.30]  for our church
[1912.30 --> 1912.96]  that's my prayer
[1912.96 --> 1913.72]  for Paige
[1913.72 --> 1915.28]  and my prayer
[1915.28 --> 1915.92]  is that all of
[1915.92 --> 1917.20]  us would play
[1917.20 --> 1917.90]  our part
[1917.90 --> 1919.02]  in living
[1919.02 --> 1919.92]  and speaking
[1919.92 --> 1920.76]  and raising
[1920.76 --> 1921.44]  our kids
[1921.44 --> 1922.56]  to know that
[1922.56 --> 1923.12]  our God
[1923.12 --> 1923.70]  is the great
[1923.70 --> 1924.22]  rescuer
[1924.22 --> 1925.50]  that the
[1925.50 --> 1926.16]  empty cross
[1926.16 --> 1926.66]  is our
[1926.66 --> 1927.34]  deliverance
[1927.34 --> 1928.44]  and that we
[1928.44 --> 1929.06]  have been set
[1929.06 --> 1929.44]  free
[1929.44 --> 1930.22]  through the
[1930.22 --> 1930.56]  blood of
[1930.56 --> 1931.26]  Jesus Christ
[1931.26 --> 1932.30]  and the
[1932.30 --> 1932.90]  nations
[1932.90 --> 1933.94]  need to receive
[1933.94 --> 1934.52]  that blessing
[1934.52 --> 1935.12]  that comes
[1935.12 --> 1935.66]  through the
[1935.66 --> 1936.02]  church
[1936.02 --> 1939.22]  I want to
[1939.22 --> 1939.82]  read again
[1939.82 --> 1941.76]  from Psalm
[1941.76 --> 1942.44]  78
[1942.44 --> 1943.92]  which is down
[1943.92 --> 1944.24]  here
[1944.24 --> 1948.78]  I want to
[1948.78 --> 1949.22]  finish my
[1949.22 --> 1949.68]  sermon with
[1949.68 --> 1949.96]  how we
[1949.96 --> 1950.40]  finished our
[1950.40 --> 1950.78]  prayer for
[1950.78 --> 1951.28]  the baptism
[1951.28 --> 1954.64]  we will tell
[1954.64 --> 1955.02]  the next
[1955.02 --> 1955.54]  generation
[1955.54 --> 1956.06]  the praise
[1956.06 --> 1956.42]  were the

[1973.34 --> 1974.20]  in God
[1974.20 --> 1974.86]  and not

[1975.40 --> 1975.76]  deeds
[1975.76 --> 1976.32]  and would
