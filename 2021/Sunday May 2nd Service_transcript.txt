[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Thank you.
[122.00 --> 124.00]  Thank you.
[124.00 --> 126.00]  Thank you.
[126.00 --> 128.00]  Thank you.
[128.00 --> 136.50]  And it's in the sense that it unveils or discloses for us a deeper reality lying behind our own world.
[136.50 --> 143.80]  Well, friends at home and here in the church building, let's all say the name of this last book in our Bible together.
[143.94 --> 144.60]  Are you ready, kids?
[144.68 --> 145.28]  After three.
[145.76 --> 147.12]  One, two, three.
[147.12 --> 148.12]  Revelation.
[148.12 --> 149.12]  Revelation.
[149.12 --> 152.40]  The book of Revelation just before the maps.
[152.40 --> 158.18]  I wonder if there's anyone in the church today who is into fantasy literature.
[158.46 --> 160.38]  Is there anyone here who's into fantasy literature?
[160.68 --> 164.44]  If you're into fantasy literature, elbow the person next to you on the couch.
[164.56 --> 165.68]  Just a little bit too hard.
[165.68 --> 172.36]  Well, high quality fantasy literature has some similarities to the book of Revelation as well.
[172.62 --> 180.78]  Because high quality fantasy literature isn't just story, but it discloses something about the reality of our own world.
[181.60 --> 183.00]  That's how fantasy literature works.
[183.06 --> 184.30]  That's how Revelation works.
[184.30 --> 188.76]  It's like the gospel in a different mode.
[189.66 --> 191.04]  Revelation is poetic.
[191.82 --> 192.92]  It's a work of art.
[192.92 --> 200.70]  The Apostle John, who probably wrote Revelation, is a bit like a Lewis or Tolkien figure himself.
[201.86 --> 203.64]  It's in a poetic mode.
[204.66 --> 208.78]  I myself am an artist, but definitely not with words.
[208.88 --> 213.00]  My wife would tell you I'm not that good with words, but I'm a jazz musician.
[213.00 --> 219.30]  And I think that Revelation provokes art because it's a literary work of art.
[219.58 --> 227.90]  So I'm going to play a jazz tune that I think sings the song of Revelation after this 20 minutes of speaking about the book of Revelation.
[228.54 --> 237.20]  Let me share with you, when my daughter Marla was three, her and I sat on the couch and read The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe together.
[237.42 --> 238.70]  From the 90th series, right?
[238.78 --> 239.28]  C.S. Lewis.
[239.28 --> 245.08]  And you remember that moment in The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe where the snow starts to melt.
[245.78 --> 252.40]  And all of a sudden, the white witch, her sled gets stuck because the snow is starting to melt.
[252.88 --> 259.12]  And because winter is thawing, the birds start to chirrup in the trees and the brook starts to gurgle.
[259.12 --> 260.94]  You can hear these sounds.
[262.00 --> 265.44]  And now Marla leans into me on the couch and she gasps.
[266.00 --> 268.04]  She says, Aslan is coming.
[269.26 --> 270.82]  She knew what was going on.
[271.88 --> 284.86]  If nothing else in this 20 minutes, I hope that you might gasp, that you might be amazed or awoken to the power of this last book in your Bible and mine.
[284.86 --> 290.78]  That, wow, there's more going on here than meets the eye.
[291.04 --> 293.20]  And I am a part of this story.
[293.82 --> 298.90]  There was a powerful and sweeping story that's animating what we see with our eyes.
[299.20 --> 301.82]  And I'm a part of this bigger story.
[302.20 --> 303.54]  We can think to ourselves.
[303.54 --> 308.48]  Well, let me give you a tip for when you read the book of Revelation.
[309.70 --> 317.70]  When you read the book of Revelation, don't try and map every detail out onto those kind of first central historical circumstances.
[318.42 --> 322.34]  But try and understand the broad and powerful sweep of the book.
[323.16 --> 326.52]  And understand its central characters as we'll try and do today.
[326.52 --> 339.94]  Well, I think that many of you probably already know what the real empire and the real historical reality and the real churches are that lay behind these symbolic images in Revelation.
[340.38 --> 343.84]  Of course, the real empire is the Roman Empire of the first century.
[344.38 --> 350.58]  You may know that many historians say that, I mean, every empire is barbaric in many ways.
[350.58 --> 355.74]  But the Roman Empire, many historians say, was the most barbaric of all.
[357.00 --> 361.16]  50% of the population of the Roman Empire were what?
[361.40 --> 361.76]  Do you know?
[362.16 --> 363.66]  50% were enslaved.
[364.36 --> 366.88]  And it was a barbaric kind of enslavement.
[367.46 --> 371.04]  It was a barbaric system, the Roman Empire.
[371.66 --> 378.56]  And John tells a story of this empire using symbols, word pictures, a bit like Tolkien and Lewis.
[378.56 --> 383.44]  And so there is a mad lashing dragon who stands for Satan.
[384.58 --> 392.60]  And this mad lashing dragon is the power who is behind two grotesque and terrifying beasts.
[393.42 --> 396.18]  There's the beast that rises out of the ocean.
[396.88 --> 398.80]  Ten heads, seven horns.
[399.46 --> 404.14]  And this ocean beast stands for the political power of the mighty Roman Empire.
[404.14 --> 409.70]  And then there is the mad beast that rises out of the earth.
[410.78 --> 415.46]  And this one has the tongue or words or the sound of the dragon himself.
[416.18 --> 423.20]  This beast stands for the imperial priesthood or the cult or the system of worship of the empire,
[423.98 --> 429.36]  animated by demons, stirring allegiance to the evil of the empire.
[429.36 --> 432.32]  These are some of the symbols in the book of Revelation.
[433.20 --> 436.54]  But let me tell you one more symbol that holds us secure.
[436.96 --> 438.66]  And it comes in chapter 4 and 5.
[439.08 --> 441.00]  It anchors the book in Revelation.
[442.16 --> 444.80]  Picture a symbolic throne room of God.
[444.92 --> 447.26]  Can you picture a symbolic throne room here?
[447.92 --> 449.36]  Here is the great throne.
[449.36 --> 455.72]  And the one sitting on the throne has the appearance of ruby and jasper.
[456.88 --> 463.92]  Around the great throne are 24 other thrones, smaller, with 24 elders sitting on them,
[464.46 --> 467.40]  clothed in white, with crowns on their heads.
[468.20 --> 473.74]  Thunder and lightning ricocheting from the main throne around the throne room,
[474.12 --> 476.24]  showing them majesty and power.
[476.24 --> 482.04]  And here are seven burning lamps before the great throne,
[482.26 --> 488.94]  which is the spirit, showing the powerful, active reign of God in the world.
[490.08 --> 493.22]  But there's a problem in this heavenly throne room.
[493.76 --> 497.80]  Because the one on the throne has a scroll in his hand,
[498.28 --> 501.84]  and no one can open the scroll, sealed with seven seals.
[501.84 --> 509.12]  And the problem is that that scroll stands for the good future that God has for the earth.
[509.86 --> 511.18]  But no one can open the scroll.
[511.76 --> 513.16]  A mighty angel says,
[513.66 --> 515.56]  Who is worthy to open the scroll?
[516.24 --> 518.98]  And in Revelation 5, the apostle John says,
[518.98 --> 527.84]  I wept and I wept because there was no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth worthy to open the scroll
[527.84 --> 533.34]  to secure the good future that God has for this world.
[534.28 --> 536.38]  Then one of the elders says to John,
[536.92 --> 540.52]  Look, here is the lion from the tribe of Judah.
[541.40 --> 543.54]  He is worthy to open the scroll.
[543.54 --> 551.36]  And then John turns and he sees a lamb, a lamb, looking as though it had been slain.
[552.24 --> 555.58]  The lamb takes the scroll from God's hands.
[557.10 --> 561.10]  The lamb is worthy to open the scroll and wonderful hymns sung.
[562.86 --> 569.02]  Well, the significance of this beautiful image here is where it comes in the book of Revelation.
[569.02 --> 570.64]  Chapters 4 and 5.
[571.50 --> 577.92]  Immediately following these seven letters to the seven churches that we're studying in this sermon series.
[578.52 --> 583.74]  I mean, I don't know if you can see it here, but on the altar where the Lord's supper elements are,
[583.90 --> 587.70]  are these seven wonderful candles reminding us of these seven spirits.
[588.76 --> 593.66]  The throne room comes just after these seven prophecies to the seven churches,
[593.88 --> 595.64]  or the seven letters, if you like.
[595.64 --> 603.82]  Because these seven letters come to a local churches who are caught up, up close and personal,
[604.46 --> 610.48]  in the intimate struggle of this huge cosmic conflict between empires.
[611.26 --> 614.20]  Up close and personal, in these seven cities,
[614.62 --> 619.32]  these Christ followers are engaged in a cosmic battle.
[620.18 --> 625.26]  That's why these seven letters are followed by this throne room image, you see.
[625.64 --> 628.10]  Seven letters.
[628.50 --> 629.26]  Seven churches.
[630.16 --> 633.08]  And they're real prophecies to real churches.
[633.62 --> 635.58]  But it's also symbolic in itself.
[636.06 --> 640.34]  The number seven, as you probably know, is the divine number in the Old and New Testament.
[640.92 --> 642.20]  It stands for completeness.
[643.14 --> 644.96]  And so, there are seven real churches,
[645.42 --> 646.40]  2,000 years ago,
[646.40 --> 650.82]  in what we know today as modern-day Turkey.
[651.76 --> 656.14]  But the number seven also stands for all churches at every time.
[657.62 --> 658.48]  For us, too.
[659.80 --> 663.58]  Well, there's one letter that we're going to spend a little bit of time in now,
[663.70 --> 666.44]  and that's the second letter in chapter two,
[667.18 --> 669.38]  the prophecy to the church in Smyrna.
[670.38 --> 672.20]  So, here is my letter,
[672.40 --> 673.18]  if you can see it.
[673.58 --> 676.50]  And to get you in through this letter to the church in Smyrna,
[676.74 --> 681.08]  I want to tell you about what I think our kids are doing at home right now.
[681.52 --> 683.30]  And this is what we did last week as well.
[683.52 --> 686.10]  You see, my family have been tracking with Hope Community Church.
[686.32 --> 688.90]  We're walking with you through the different sermon series this year,
[689.32 --> 691.34]  including through the book of Revelation.
[692.24 --> 693.40]  And so, what we did last week,
[693.44 --> 695.30]  and what I think our kids are doing this week is,
[695.84 --> 697.38]  well, we've printed off this letter here,
[697.44 --> 700.42]  and you can see sort of a blank bit of paper with the lines.
[701.22 --> 704.62]  And we're going to imagine that this is the letter to the church in Smyrna.
[704.94 --> 705.20]  Okay?
[705.82 --> 707.12]  So, our kids have this.
[707.38 --> 709.54]  You might want to do this with your kids at home if you like.
[710.52 --> 712.06]  And the first thing we do with our kids
[712.06 --> 714.04]  is to talk about the city,
[714.38 --> 717.50]  this urban context that the letter is written to.
[717.88 --> 718.66]  Well, it's Smyrna.
[718.66 --> 721.52]  And, in fact, Smyrna is still a city today
[721.52 --> 724.34]  on the Mediterranean Sea in modern-day Turkey.
[724.96 --> 727.32]  It's the second largest city in Turkey.
[728.24 --> 729.58]  At the time of the Roman Empire,
[730.22 --> 731.40]  Smyrna and Ephesus,
[731.78 --> 732.62]  those two cities,
[732.72 --> 733.56]  kind of fought it out
[733.56 --> 736.06]  to be the greatest, most glorious city
[736.06 --> 738.58]  in the Roman province of Asia.
[739.96 --> 742.60]  But ancient Smyrna was a very difficult place
[742.60 --> 744.54]  to be a community of Christ followers.
[744.54 --> 749.62]  And that's because of the imperial worship of Caesar,
[750.14 --> 751.62]  because of the imperial cult,
[752.46 --> 753.88]  and the need, the requirement,
[754.02 --> 756.08]  to pledge allegiance to Caesar
[756.08 --> 759.28]  and to engage somehow in imperial worship.
[759.72 --> 761.54]  There was also a bunch of Jews
[761.54 --> 762.98]  who were persecuting the church.
[764.58 --> 765.66]  Well, these are the things
[765.66 --> 767.76]  that we would explain to our kids, you see.
[768.16 --> 769.34]  And then the next thing we do
[769.34 --> 770.80]  before we get stuck into the letter
[770.80 --> 773.04]  is we read the passage.
[773.34 --> 774.88]  So let me read the passage with you now.
[775.58 --> 777.42]  Ideally, you'd be able to crack open a Bible.
[777.96 --> 779.46]  iPhones and Androids are good, too.
[779.92 --> 782.70]  Let me read to you from chapter 2 from verse 8.
[782.94 --> 784.36]  It's just four short verses,
[784.94 --> 786.68]  this letter to the church in Smyrna.
[786.80 --> 787.30]  Here we go.
[787.72 --> 789.12]  Revelation 2 from verse 8.
[789.42 --> 790.16]  Do open it up.
[790.72 --> 792.18]  We're going to read through it a couple of times.
[792.18 --> 795.50]  To the angel of the church in Smyrna write,
[796.44 --> 797.52]  These are the words of him
[797.52 --> 798.92]  who was the first and the last,
[799.50 --> 801.40]  who died and came alive again.
[802.04 --> 804.32]  I know your afflictions and your poverty,
[804.86 --> 805.70]  yet you are rich.
[806.32 --> 808.26]  I know about the slander of those
[808.26 --> 810.22]  who say they are Jews and are not,
[810.64 --> 811.98]  but are a synagogue of Satan.
[812.76 --> 814.84]  Do not be afraid of what you're about to suffer.
[815.84 --> 817.62]  I tell you the devil will put some of you
[817.62 --> 818.82]  in prison to test you,
[819.40 --> 821.64]  and you will suffer persecution for ten days.
[822.18 --> 824.42]  Be faithful even to the point of death,
[824.62 --> 827.70]  and I will give you life as your victor's crown.
[828.70 --> 829.84]  Whoever has ears,
[829.98 --> 832.24]  let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[833.16 --> 834.40]  Those who are victorious
[834.40 --> 837.76]  will not be hurt at all by the second death.
[840.30 --> 841.66]  Having read the passage,
[841.92 --> 843.60]  we come to the letter with our kids.
[844.24 --> 845.72]  And you'll see written down here
[845.72 --> 846.78]  on the bottom of the letter
[846.78 --> 848.38]  is the final verse.
[849.00 --> 851.34]  And that's because in all seven letters,
[851.34 --> 853.12]  they all end the same,
[853.70 --> 854.86]  with some slight changes.
[855.50 --> 856.80]  Let me read the verses here.
[856.86 --> 857.16]  I don't know,
[857.24 --> 858.54]  you probably can't read it on the camera.
[859.18 --> 860.66]  Let anyone who has an ear
[860.66 --> 862.90]  listen to what the Spirit is saying
[862.90 --> 863.96]  to the churches.
[864.56 --> 866.04]  That's how the seven letters end.
[866.78 --> 868.10]  And what it's saying is that
[868.10 --> 870.96]  those who have allegiance to the land,
[871.54 --> 873.42]  they are alert and attentive
[873.42 --> 875.28]  and listening to the words of God.
[877.84 --> 879.14]  And you can see here
[879.14 --> 881.28]  the images that our kids draw
[881.28 --> 882.62]  around the outside.
[883.30 --> 884.24]  I drew these ones.
[884.64 --> 886.36]  My kids are much better artists than me.
[886.88 --> 887.72]  But just here
[887.72 --> 889.62]  is from the beginning of chapter 2,
[890.42 --> 893.26]  in the letter to the church in Ephesus,
[893.78 --> 895.72]  which is a vision of the Son of Man
[895.72 --> 898.62]  who is holding seven stars in his hands.
[899.40 --> 901.18]  You remember that the seven stars
[901.18 --> 902.90]  are the seven angels
[902.90 --> 904.28]  who are ministering,
[904.62 --> 906.00]  guarding these churches.
[906.82 --> 908.38]  And then down here, of course,
[908.46 --> 909.64]  are the seven lampstands.
[909.64 --> 911.06]  Do you remember the seven lampstands?
[911.50 --> 914.26]  These lamps are the seven churches.
[914.78 --> 916.08]  And the precious thing
[916.08 --> 917.62]  about these symbols
[917.62 --> 919.44]  is that the Son of Man
[919.44 --> 921.72]  walks among the lampstands.
[921.72 --> 924.06]  It's a sign of the protection,
[924.82 --> 925.62]  the encouragement,
[926.30 --> 928.34]  the ministry of the risen Christ
[928.34 --> 931.22]  to these persecuted churches.
[931.86 --> 933.14]  Certainly in Smyrna,
[933.20 --> 934.24]  the church is persecuted,
[934.76 --> 936.20]  not in every city.
[937.46 --> 938.38]  So these symbols
[938.38 --> 940.08]  that are holding the church,
[940.58 --> 942.90]  reminding them of the ministry of Jesus,
[943.78 --> 945.50]  holding them to himself
[945.50 --> 948.08]  amidst these competing ideologies
[948.08 --> 949.22]  of the empire.
[949.22 --> 952.22]  We've seen the end of the letter.
[952.92 --> 953.66]  Let me tell you about
[953.66 --> 954.98]  the opening of the letter.
[955.34 --> 956.28]  That's interesting too.
[957.26 --> 958.70]  All seven of these letters
[958.70 --> 960.98]  open in almost the same way,
[961.40 --> 962.62]  but with a slight change
[962.62 --> 963.86]  each time once again.
[965.00 --> 966.42]  The letters open like this.
[967.82 --> 969.94]  And to the angel of the church
[969.94 --> 971.66]  in Smyrna write,
[971.76 --> 972.72]  or it might be Ephesus,
[973.10 --> 975.14]  Ephesus or Thyatira write,
[975.46 --> 976.40]  to the angel of the church
[976.40 --> 977.16]  of Smyrna write,
[977.16 --> 979.54]  these are the words of,
[980.16 --> 980.96]  and then it goes on
[980.96 --> 981.90]  to describe Jesus.
[982.02 --> 982.92]  These are the words of Jesus.
[983.20 --> 984.28]  And it describes Jesus
[984.28 --> 986.00]  in a way that is relevant
[986.00 --> 987.34]  for the particular situation
[987.34 --> 988.12]  of the church.
[988.86 --> 991.12]  Now Smyrna is a persecuted church.
[992.12 --> 993.32]  And John is telling them
[993.32 --> 994.36]  that they are suffering,
[994.58 --> 995.96]  but soon they're going to suffer more.
[996.48 --> 997.50]  And some will die
[997.50 --> 998.94]  for their allegiance to the Lamb.
[1000.10 --> 1001.28]  And so the way that Jesus
[1001.28 --> 1002.90]  introduces himself here
[1002.90 --> 1005.00]  is ministering to them
[1005.00 --> 1006.00]  in his very name.
[1006.00 --> 1008.08]  These are the words of
[1008.08 --> 1010.50]  the first and the last
[1010.50 --> 1011.78]  who was dead
[1011.78 --> 1013.22]  and came to life.
[1013.74 --> 1015.34]  This is a word for a church
[1015.34 --> 1016.36]  who is suffering.
[1016.54 --> 1017.60]  It's a name for Jesus
[1017.60 --> 1019.64]  for a church who is suffering.
[1020.50 --> 1021.46]  I'm sure you've heard
[1021.46 --> 1022.64]  this name for Jesus before.
[1023.20 --> 1024.18]  First and last,
[1024.84 --> 1025.68]  beginning and end,
[1026.84 --> 1027.88]  alpha and omega,
[1028.10 --> 1029.06]  the first and last letters
[1029.06 --> 1029.82]  in the Greek alphabet.
[1030.38 --> 1031.76]  And the significance of Jesus
[1031.76 --> 1033.80]  naming himself like this
[1033.80 --> 1035.46]  for this suffering church.
[1035.80 --> 1036.48]  First and last,
[1037.42 --> 1038.74]  it's very significant
[1038.74 --> 1040.04]  for these suffering people.
[1040.86 --> 1041.98]  Not just because Jesus
[1041.98 --> 1043.00]  was there in the beginning
[1043.00 --> 1044.80]  and will be there at the end,
[1044.98 --> 1046.18]  even though that is remarkable,
[1046.88 --> 1048.08]  but it's for the action
[1048.08 --> 1048.92]  of Jesus,
[1049.46 --> 1050.14]  for what he's doing.
[1050.96 --> 1052.72]  Jesus was there as the creator
[1052.72 --> 1055.04]  and Jesus is going to be there
[1055.04 --> 1055.66]  at the end
[1055.66 --> 1056.72]  as the one
[1056.72 --> 1057.72]  who is renewing
[1057.72 --> 1058.62]  all things.
[1059.16 --> 1060.28]  As the one who opens
[1060.28 --> 1061.00]  the scrolls
[1061.00 --> 1062.00]  through his suffering,
[1062.56 --> 1063.04]  he's the one
[1063.04 --> 1063.94]  who secures
[1063.94 --> 1065.50]  the creation.
[1067.18 --> 1067.94]  And then,
[1068.02 --> 1069.12]  Jesus introduces himself
[1069.12 --> 1070.24]  still in this opening
[1070.24 --> 1070.78]  of the letter,
[1071.58 --> 1072.04]  the one who,
[1072.22 --> 1072.80]  I was dead
[1072.80 --> 1074.66]  and now I am alive.
[1075.58 --> 1075.96]  And again,
[1076.06 --> 1077.38]  what a name for Jesus
[1077.38 --> 1079.22]  for this suffering church.
[1080.02 --> 1081.74]  I think we all fear death
[1081.74 --> 1083.08]  in one way or another,
[1084.16 --> 1086.16]  but in Jesus' resurrection,
[1086.50 --> 1087.62]  Jesus raised Jesus
[1087.62 --> 1088.32]  from the dead
[1088.32 --> 1089.64]  as the firstfruits
[1089.64 --> 1091.12]  of this whole world
[1091.12 --> 1091.78]  renewed.
[1092.84 --> 1093.76]  What a comfort
[1093.76 --> 1095.26]  for these suffering
[1095.26 --> 1096.20]  Christ followers.
[1097.32 --> 1098.16]  Well, that's how
[1098.16 --> 1098.96]  this letter begins.
[1099.72 --> 1100.70]  That's how the letter begins.
[1102.38 --> 1102.96]  You know,
[1103.00 --> 1103.90]  there's a beautiful piece
[1103.90 --> 1104.80]  in church history
[1104.80 --> 1106.46]  that relates to this letter
[1106.46 --> 1107.48]  to Smyrna.
[1109.82 --> 1111.14]  Revelation was written
[1111.14 --> 1112.48]  around 90 AD,
[1112.62 --> 1113.42]  95 AD.
[1113.84 --> 1115.42]  And about 65 years later,
[1115.76 --> 1116.84]  there was a very famous
[1116.84 --> 1118.42]  martyr in Smyrna
[1118.42 --> 1120.82]  called Bishop Polycarp.
[1121.48 --> 1123.36]  About 65 years
[1123.36 --> 1125.34]  after John wrote this letter
[1125.34 --> 1126.70]  from Jesus to Smyrna,
[1127.24 --> 1127.82]  Polycarp,
[1127.88 --> 1128.64]  Bishop Polycarp,
[1128.68 --> 1129.34]  was martyred
[1129.34 --> 1130.54]  in Smyrna,
[1130.64 --> 1131.36]  this same city.
[1131.84 --> 1133.00]  Murdered in the same arena
[1133.00 --> 1134.48]  that John would have known
[1134.48 --> 1134.96]  and seen.
[1136.08 --> 1137.00]  Polycarp was,
[1137.88 --> 1139.00]  the remarkable thing
[1139.00 --> 1139.84]  about this story,
[1139.96 --> 1140.72]  truly remarkable
[1140.72 --> 1141.64]  in church history,
[1141.78 --> 1142.72]  is that Polycarp
[1142.72 --> 1144.10]  was actually a disciple
[1144.10 --> 1144.72]  of John
[1144.72 --> 1146.40]  who probably wrote Revelation.
[1147.54 --> 1148.84]  He was revered
[1148.84 --> 1149.94]  and he was martyred
[1149.94 --> 1152.30]  aged around 68,
[1152.72 --> 1153.84]  86 rather,
[1153.92 --> 1154.52]  we understand,
[1154.84 --> 1155.76]  aged around 86.
[1158.24 --> 1160.28]  When Polycarp was arrested,
[1161.04 --> 1161.64]  he was marched
[1161.64 --> 1162.50]  by the soldiers
[1162.50 --> 1163.54]  to the arena.
[1164.92 --> 1165.82]  And just to say,
[1165.90 --> 1167.24]  I'm sure that Polycarp
[1167.24 --> 1168.02]  would have known
[1168.02 --> 1169.56]  this letter in Revelation
[1169.56 --> 1171.32]  to Smyrna by heart.
[1171.74 --> 1172.42]  He would have known
[1172.42 --> 1173.24]  these four verses.
[1174.70 --> 1175.34]  He was marching
[1175.34 --> 1176.02]  to the arena
[1176.02 --> 1177.44]  and he heard a voice
[1177.44 --> 1178.12]  from God
[1178.12 --> 1179.00]  saying,
[1179.66 --> 1180.66]  play the man,
[1181.16 --> 1181.74]  Polycarp.
[1184.06 --> 1185.84]  Well, the Roman proconsul
[1185.84 --> 1186.62]  in the arena
[1186.62 --> 1188.52]  before a great Roman crowd
[1188.52 --> 1190.20]  commanded Polycarp
[1190.20 --> 1192.10]  to deny Christ
[1192.10 --> 1194.58]  and to confess allegiance
[1194.58 --> 1195.74]  to Caesar
[1195.74 --> 1197.32]  and to the empire.
[1197.80 --> 1198.64]  Swear by the fortune
[1198.64 --> 1199.14]  of Caesar,
[1199.58 --> 1199.98]  he said.
[1200.80 --> 1201.64]  Polycarp said this
[1201.64 --> 1202.54]  to the proconsul,
[1202.54 --> 1205.68]  86 years I have served him
[1205.68 --> 1207.38]  and he has done me
[1207.38 --> 1207.92]  no wrong.
[1208.86 --> 1210.24]  How can I blaspheme
[1210.24 --> 1211.20]  my king
[1211.20 --> 1212.30]  and savior?
[1214.72 --> 1215.24]  And perhaps
[1215.24 --> 1216.04]  that confession
[1216.04 --> 1216.96]  of Polycarp,
[1217.20 --> 1218.68]  after which he was burnt,
[1220.06 --> 1221.22]  summarizes and captures
[1221.22 --> 1222.20]  the book of Revelation
[1222.20 --> 1224.94]  that the risen lamb
[1224.94 --> 1226.48]  holds the future secure.
[1227.66 --> 1228.80]  And yet the reality
[1228.80 --> 1230.00]  for many of these Christians
[1230.00 --> 1231.36]  was terrifying.
[1233.02 --> 1234.10]  And the way
[1234.10 --> 1235.38]  of following Christ,
[1235.48 --> 1236.30]  the way of allegiance
[1236.30 --> 1237.10]  to the lamb
[1237.10 --> 1238.86]  is often the way
[1238.86 --> 1239.94]  of suffering.
[1242.56 --> 1243.68]  I want to just quickly
[1243.68 --> 1244.18]  read through
[1244.18 --> 1244.84]  some of the verses
[1244.84 --> 1245.98]  in this passage again.
[1246.42 --> 1247.74]  Let me read from verse 9
[1247.74 --> 1249.18]  just to track with it.
[1249.32 --> 1250.18]  If you'd have a look again
[1250.18 --> 1251.52]  and crack open your Bible
[1251.52 --> 1252.44]  or your Android.
[1253.54 --> 1254.14]  Verse 9,
[1254.52 --> 1255.84]  I know your afflictions
[1255.84 --> 1256.74]  and your poverty
[1256.74 --> 1258.18]  even though you are rich.
[1259.18 --> 1259.98]  The truth is
[1259.98 --> 1261.26]  that these suffering,
[1261.68 --> 1262.86]  persecuted people
[1262.86 --> 1263.48]  in Smyrna
[1263.48 --> 1265.32]  would not have had a way
[1265.32 --> 1266.12]  to make a living
[1266.12 --> 1267.02]  because they were
[1267.02 --> 1267.66]  on the outside
[1267.66 --> 1268.32]  of the economy.
[1269.16 --> 1270.10]  I know the slander
[1270.10 --> 1271.16]  on the part of those
[1271.16 --> 1272.54]  who say they are Jews
[1272.54 --> 1273.36]  and are not
[1273.36 --> 1274.56]  but are a synagogue
[1274.56 --> 1275.14]  of Satan.
[1275.78 --> 1276.40]  We see that in
[1276.40 --> 1277.48]  Polycarp's story too.
[1278.46 --> 1279.20]  Now verse 10,
[1280.10 --> 1281.28]  Jesus says through John,
[1281.50 --> 1282.16]  do not fear
[1282.16 --> 1282.82]  what you are about
[1282.82 --> 1283.38]  to suffer.
[1284.44 --> 1285.30]  Beware the devil
[1285.30 --> 1286.12]  is about to throw
[1286.12 --> 1287.12]  some of you in prison
[1287.12 --> 1288.88]  so that you may be tested
[1288.88 --> 1290.34]  and for 10 days
[1290.34 --> 1291.58]  you will have affliction,
[1291.78 --> 1292.82]  some to the point of death.
[1293.74 --> 1294.58]  For 10 days.
[1294.64 --> 1295.44]  It's going to be long
[1295.44 --> 1297.50]  but there is an end as well.
[1298.22 --> 1299.04]  Indeed it will come
[1299.04 --> 1299.56]  to an end.
[1300.56 --> 1301.72]  Be faithful unto death
[1301.72 --> 1302.60]  and I will give you
[1302.60 --> 1304.26]  the crown of life.
[1305.62 --> 1306.84]  That crown is probably
[1306.84 --> 1308.34]  a laurel wreath
[1308.34 --> 1309.02]  like we know
[1309.02 --> 1310.12]  from the Olympic Games.
[1311.34 --> 1312.04]  And then finally,
[1312.82 --> 1314.08]  this phrase that occurs
[1314.08 --> 1315.80]  throughout these seven letters.
[1316.58 --> 1317.68]  Whoever conquers
[1317.68 --> 1318.96]  will not be harmed
[1318.96 --> 1320.02]  by the second death.
[1320.90 --> 1322.68]  This motif of conquering
[1322.68 --> 1324.30]  and of course we know
[1324.30 --> 1325.76]  from the life of Polycarp
[1325.76 --> 1326.72]  and we know
[1326.72 --> 1328.22]  from Revelation chapter 5
[1328.22 --> 1329.40]  that conquering
[1329.40 --> 1330.38]  for these Christians
[1330.38 --> 1331.64]  means suffering
[1331.64 --> 1333.22]  like the slaughtered lamb.
[1333.96 --> 1334.96]  That the most powerful
[1334.96 --> 1336.32]  witness to Christ
[1336.32 --> 1338.10]  will be in the Christ followers
[1338.10 --> 1339.34]  suffering.
[1340.14 --> 1341.30]  That the powerful witness
[1341.30 --> 1342.44]  to Christ in the world
[1342.44 --> 1344.12]  will be from their suffering
[1344.12 --> 1345.70]  and for many of them
[1345.70 --> 1346.84]  even death.
[1348.66 --> 1349.94]  And it was very significant
[1349.94 --> 1351.54]  I think before we came
[1351.54 --> 1353.00]  to Revelation chapter 2
[1353.00 --> 1354.54]  to sit with
[1354.54 --> 1356.94]  in Joe's prayer together.
[1357.78 --> 1359.44]  Praying for the persecuted church
[1359.44 --> 1360.18]  throughout the world
[1360.18 --> 1361.60]  and in Nigeria
[1361.60 --> 1363.24]  Joe's country of origin.
[1364.38 --> 1365.48]  And of course we are aware
[1365.48 --> 1366.52]  that in 50%
[1366.52 --> 1368.02]  of countries of the world
[1368.02 --> 1369.28]  in half of the nations
[1369.28 --> 1369.88]  of the world
[1369.88 --> 1371.34]  in one way or another
[1371.34 --> 1372.56]  followers of Christ
[1372.56 --> 1373.14]  are persecuted.
[1374.40 --> 1375.52]  And it is appropriate
[1375.52 --> 1376.14]  to say
[1376.14 --> 1378.36]  that people of other faiths
[1378.36 --> 1380.12]  are persecuted.
[1380.68 --> 1381.28]  And sometimes
[1381.28 --> 1381.90]  unbelievably
[1381.90 --> 1382.72]  and horrifically
[1382.72 --> 1384.44]  it's almost
[1384.44 --> 1386.28]  terrifying to say it
[1386.28 --> 1387.60]  sometimes by people
[1387.60 --> 1388.72]  who claim
[1388.72 --> 1389.68]  to be doing so
[1389.68 --> 1390.26]  in the name
[1390.26 --> 1391.24]  of Jesus.
[1393.12 --> 1393.96]  And so
[1393.96 --> 1394.86]  as Joe led us
[1394.86 --> 1395.42]  we pray
[1395.42 --> 1396.78]  for the persecuted church
[1396.78 --> 1397.56]  and we pray
[1397.56 --> 1399.16]  for those who are persecuted
[1399.16 --> 1401.10]  of any and every faith.
[1402.16 --> 1402.82]  Knowing that
[1402.82 --> 1404.16]  in their suffering
[1404.16 --> 1405.44]  those Christ followers
[1405.44 --> 1406.58]  are bearing
[1406.58 --> 1407.94]  their primary witness
[1407.94 --> 1409.38]  to the lordship
[1409.38 --> 1410.64]  of Jesus
[1410.64 --> 1411.32]  in the world.
[1414.12 --> 1415.12]  But I tell you
[1415.12 --> 1416.28]  for Christians
[1416.28 --> 1417.14]  living in Canada
[1417.14 --> 1418.56]  it can be hard
[1418.56 --> 1419.00]  can't it
[1419.00 --> 1420.60]  to see the invitation
[1420.60 --> 1421.72]  for us
[1421.72 --> 1422.68]  in the book
[1422.68 --> 1423.26]  of Revelation.
[1423.96 --> 1424.44]  And I think
[1424.44 --> 1425.26]  the question
[1425.26 --> 1426.48]  almost a creative
[1426.48 --> 1427.54]  imaginative question
[1427.54 --> 1428.38]  we can be asking
[1428.38 --> 1428.76]  is
[1428.76 --> 1430.94]  what is the empire
[1430.94 --> 1431.52]  today?
[1432.28 --> 1433.28]  And who is the empire
[1433.28 --> 1433.76]  today?
[1434.54 --> 1434.80]  You know?
[1435.94 --> 1436.70]  Well let's just play
[1436.70 --> 1437.38]  with this question
[1437.38 --> 1438.00]  for a moment.
[1439.22 --> 1439.56]  What
[1439.56 --> 1441.16]  or who is the empire
[1441.16 --> 1441.68]  today?
[1443.00 --> 1443.60]  Let me
[1443.60 --> 1444.80]  tell a quick story
[1444.80 --> 1446.20]  or just give you
[1446.20 --> 1446.92]  a quick fact
[1446.92 --> 1447.40]  if you like
[1447.40 --> 1448.10]  as we just play
[1448.10 --> 1448.70]  with this question
[1448.70 --> 1449.40]  what or who
[1449.40 --> 1450.36]  is the empire today?
[1450.76 --> 1451.40]  Did you know
[1451.40 --> 1452.32]  and you probably do
[1452.32 --> 1453.38]  that development
[1453.38 --> 1454.76]  economists
[1454.76 --> 1455.82]  have been telling us
[1455.82 --> 1457.76]  the politics
[1457.76 --> 1458.28]  that
[1458.28 --> 1458.96]  many
[1458.96 --> 1460.54]  countries
[1460.54 --> 1462.42]  that
[1462.42 --> 1463.06]  between
[1463.06 --> 1464.28]  say
[1464.28 --> 1465.12]  for decades
[1465.12 --> 1468.42]  the amount
[1468.64 --> 1469.64]  of money
[1469.64 --> 1470.26]  that flows
[1470.26 --> 1471.70]  from
[1471.70 --> 1472.30]  foreign aid
[1472.30 --> 1473.14]  so
[1473.14 --> 1473.56]  money
[1473.56 --> 1474.10]  that
[1474.10 --> 1474.56]  that
[1474.56 --> 1474.78]  amount
[1474.78 --> 1475.28]  of
[1475.28 --> 1475.46]  money
[1475.46 --> 1475.50]  that
[1475.50 --> 1476.82]  flows
[1476.82 --> 1477.92]  from
[1477.92 --> 1478.42]  the richest
[1478.42 --> 1479.82]  countries
[1479.82 --> 1480.30]  to
[1480.30 --> 1481.90]  the richest
[1481.90 --> 1483.90]  nations
[1483.90 --> 1489.74]  the richest nations. The amount of money that flows from the developing nations, poorer
[1489.74 --> 1495.62]  nations to the richest nations is around about three times the amount that flows from the
[1495.62 --> 1501.10]  richest nations. Development economists say that the poorest nations are developing the
[1501.10 --> 1508.96]  richest nations. So again, what or who are the empires of this age? It's an important
[1508.96 --> 1513.52]  question as readers of Revelation. Here's another one. Let's just stay in Canada for
[1513.52 --> 1524.20]  now. Did you know that 4% of Canadian population is Aboriginal, First Nations, Métis or Inuit,
[1524.30 --> 1534.70]  about 4%? And did you know that in Canadian prisons, 36% of female prisoners in federal
[1534.70 --> 1541.20]  prisons, 36% are Aboriginal, First Nations, Métis or Inuit. And in provincial prisons
[1541.20 --> 1551.18]  in Canada, 43% of female inmates, 43% are Aboriginal, but only 4% of the population.
[1552.32 --> 1559.88]  So again, just to ask that question, what is the empire or who is the empire today? And
[1559.88 --> 1563.86]  the book of Revelation forces us to ask this question. Now I think if you or I sat down
[1563.86 --> 1569.68]  for a coffee, we could talk about globalized capitalism, we could talk about First Nations
[1569.68 --> 1574.24]  settler relations, and we could discern around these things. And I do think that the book of
[1574.24 --> 1579.08]  Revelation calls the church to have these conversations and to engage in this careful
[1579.08 --> 1584.30]  discernment. And as we had this conversation, we probably would be really challenged and realize
[1584.30 --> 1589.40]  we're probably a bit closer to the empire, a bit more complicit in the empire than we should
[1589.40 --> 1596.00]  be, than it's comfortable, than God calls us to be. I mean, it's no surprise that the
[1596.00 --> 1601.28]  final letter in chapter 3 of Revelation, the letter to the church in Laodicea, this church
[1601.28 --> 1608.34]  is actually very cozy in the empire, very comfortable in the empire, maybe a bit like us, unfortunately.
[1610.22 --> 1615.56]  But it can be also very hard to know what to do from there. You know, sometimes we just end
[1615.56 --> 1619.84]  in despair in our conversation or in our thoughts, and we don't know where to move, you know?
[1620.70 --> 1626.90]  For an individual, or for an individual household, it can be very hard to know what to do. It can
[1626.90 --> 1634.38]  be very hard, can't it, to live any differently. Because we just want to be like the Joneses who
[1634.38 --> 1640.26]  live next door, we just want to own the same stuff, and it's very hard, almost impossible,
[1640.26 --> 1646.70]  I think, not to live that way. So what do we do? Well, if it's impossible for an individual,
[1647.20 --> 1653.02]  if it's impossible for a household, I think anything is impossible for a Christian community
[1653.02 --> 1658.42]  that's indwelt by the Spirit of God. I think for a Christian community that's indwelt by the Spirit,
[1658.96 --> 1664.40]  a community like hope, anything is possible. It could be really exciting partnering shoulder to
[1664.40 --> 1672.48]  shoulder within our church community. If I may, just by way of illustration, in my own community,
[1672.48 --> 1680.00]  we live in East Vancouver, and there are three houses in a row that are inhabited by church people
[1680.00 --> 1687.46]  from our community. And in our little household, Erin and I, we sort of hold for our community and
[1687.46 --> 1693.48]  within our community, among our community, refugee welcome. And we try and advocate and live in
[1693.48 --> 1700.02]  solidarity with newcomers. And then the church next door to us, they sort of hold creation care.
[1700.88 --> 1708.30]  And they buy food from local farms and distribute it among our community, including to us, as a way of
[1708.30 --> 1714.40]  eating in a way that cares for the creation. That's next door. And then the next house up from there,
[1714.40 --> 1722.02]  again, they've converted their garage into a lovely prayer space for the community. And it's a place that
[1722.02 --> 1729.44]  anyone from our community can book. And they also host prayer, when it's not COVID, at 8.30pm at night.
[1729.84 --> 1736.36]  And anyone can join in, hosting this prayer space in the city. And this is a way that we can hold
[1736.36 --> 1741.64]  different aspects of Christian discipleship, different, and we can confront different idolatries
[1741.64 --> 1747.88]  that suck us in, idolatries of this empire that we're swimming in. And we can confront them as
[1747.88 --> 1754.88]  households, but hold different complex aspects on behalf of the body of Christ. No one person can do
[1754.88 --> 1762.26]  everything. No one household can do everything. So I wonder, as we come out of the book of Revelation,
[1763.22 --> 1770.92]  is the Spirit prompting you to consider stepping into something? I know that Hope Community Church,
[1771.14 --> 1775.90]  filled with the Spirit as it is, we hold different things for one another in the community.
[1775.90 --> 1783.04]  Is the Spirit calling you to step into something within this community, on behalf of this community?
[1784.00 --> 1788.54]  This is what I think a really helpful question is. To think about your neighbourhood, or think about
[1788.54 --> 1795.10]  the world, and think, what does Christ grieve? And what does Christ celebrate? They're my two key
[1795.10 --> 1800.80]  questions. And I believe they're questions that come from Revelation. What does Christ grieve? And what does
[1800.80 --> 1806.34]  Christ celebrate? Think about your local neighbourhood? Think about the broader neighbourhood here in Langley?
[1807.14 --> 1811.80]  Think about the world. When Christ looks on your neighbourhood, when Christ looks at the world,
[1811.86 --> 1817.00]  what does Christ grieve? And what does Christ celebrate? And I literally invite you to share
[1817.00 --> 1822.28]  your answer to one or both of those questions to someone in your household there, sitting on the couch,
[1823.26 --> 1826.00]  or to text someone else in the church community. Do both.
[1826.00 --> 1830.64]  Think about your answer to one or both of those questions. What does Christ grieve? And what does
[1830.64 --> 1837.22]  Christ celebrate? Well, I promised to do some art. And I want to play some music right now, real quick,
[1837.64 --> 1843.94]  because this is a work of art, this book of Revelation. It's evocative and it stirs our imagination.
[1843.94 --> 1853.18]  And I think the music that, for me, sings the song of Revelation is the blues, played with some
[1853.18 --> 1859.52]  celebration, because the blues was birthed in the context of the enslavement of African-American
[1859.52 --> 1866.76]  people in the United States. And then the ongoing oppression of African-American people after
[1866.76 --> 1875.06]  emancipation in 1863. That went on and, frankly, continues on. This is where the blues gets its sadness,
[1875.48 --> 1880.66]  but this is where the blues gets its celebration and its resilience, from the celebration and resilience
[1880.66 --> 1888.04]  of this people. So let me play a blues, and I'll play it in a celebratory way, because I think that this is
[1888.04 --> 1892.92]  the tone of the book of Revelation. And I believe that in the heavenlies, and when this world is renewed,
[1892.92 --> 1899.04]  this will be the tone of the art that's played and drawn and painted. I think that it's going to
[1899.04 --> 1905.14]  express something of the suffering of what has been, but also express the resilience and the celebration
[1905.14 --> 1910.64]  of the victory of the Lamb. So I'll just play blues for a couple of minutes, and as I do, I invite you to
[1910.64 --> 1915.36]  text your answer to these two questions. What does Christ grieve? What does Christ celebrate?
[1915.36 --> 1922.08]  I'm sorry.
[1922.08 --> 1952.06]  Thank you.
[1952.08 --> 1982.06]  Thank you.
[1982.08 --> 2012.06]  Thank you.
[2012.08 --> 2042.06]  Thank you.
[2042.06 --> 2044.06]  Thank you.
[2072.06 --> 2074.06]  Thank you.
[2074.06 --> 2076.06]  Thank you.
[2076.06 --> 2078.06]  Thank you.
[2078.06 --> 2080.06]  Thank you.
[2083.06 --> 2085.76]  For those who need to prepare, please do so during this time.
[2085.76 --> 2089.28]  And for those who did so earlier, we invite you to worship with us.
[2089.28 --> 2091.28]  Thank you.
[2091.28 --> 2095.28]  Thank you.
[2095.28 --> 2097.28]  Thank you.
[2097.28 --> 2103.28]  Thank you.
[2103.28 --> 2105.28]  Thank you.
[2105.28 --> 2115.28]  Thank you.
[2115.28 --> 2117.28]  Thank you.
[2117.28 --> 2119.28]  Thank you.
[2119.28 --> 2127.28]  In the presence of holiness, I cannot speak.
[2127.28 --> 2133.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2133.28 --> 2137.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2137.28 --> 2139.28]  In the presence of everything.
[2139.28 --> 2143.28]  In the presence of perfect love, I am too weak.
[2143.28 --> 2145.28]  In the presence of perfect love, I am too weak.
[2145.28 --> 2153.28]  In the presence of perfect love, I am too weak.
[2153.28 --> 2155.28]  I am too weak.
[2155.28 --> 2157.28]  I am too weak.
[2157.28 --> 2161.28]  I am too weak.
[2161.28 --> 2165.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2165.28 --> 2167.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2167.28 --> 2173.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2173.28 --> 2175.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2175.28 --> 2179.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2179.28 --> 2181.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2181.28 --> 2183.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2183.28 --> 2185.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2185.28 --> 2187.28]  Hear the word.
[2187.28 --> 2189.28]  Hear the word.
[2189.28 --> 2193.28]  Hear the word.
[2193.28 --> 2195.28]  Spoken from the tree.
[2195.28 --> 2197.28]  Heaven broken.
[2197.28 --> 2201.28]  Heaven broken.
[2201.28 --> 2205.28]  Heaven broken.
[2225.28 --> 2229.28]  God broken.
[2229.28 --> 2231.28]  God broken.
[2231.28 --> 2235.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2235.28 --> 2241.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2241.28 --> 2247.28]  Your blood says everything.
[2247.28 --> 2251.28]  Hear the word.
[2251.28 --> 2253.28]  Lord broken.
[2253.28 --> 2272.94]  The word spoken from the tree
[2272.94 --> 2284.52]  Heaven grow open
[2284.52 --> 2297.92]  Your life says everything
[2297.92 --> 2310.76]  Your blood says everything
[2310.76 --> 2316.08]  The blood of Jesus
[2316.08 --> 2323.96]  Your blood says everything
[2323.96 --> 2337.08]  Your blood says everything
[2337.08 --> 2367.06]  Your blood says everything
[2367.08 --> 2397.06]  Your blood says everything
[2397.08 --> 2401.98]  Sisters and brothers, we come to the Lord's table now.
[2402.88 --> 2406.14]  Some of us, most of us are in our households.
[2407.16 --> 2408.34]  Some of us are in our kitchen.
[2408.52 --> 2411.18]  Some of us are sitting on the couch in our living rooms perhaps.
[2412.12 --> 2414.44]  And a small number of us are here in the building.
[2415.18 --> 2418.12]  But we're gathered virtually by the Spirit of Christ.
[2418.66 --> 2420.86]  Still don't have my head around how that works.
[2421.20 --> 2422.36]  But it works, I'm sure.
[2422.36 --> 2432.00]  Friends, the people of God conquer, it turns out, in our suffering in the name of Christ.
[2433.32 --> 2440.12]  We worship a slaughtered lamb who is worthy to open the scroll,
[2440.12 --> 2444.30]  to unfold the good future that God has for the world.
[2445.02 --> 2448.84]  And so the people of God in Smyrna conquer.
[2449.18 --> 2453.68]  Their most powerful witness in the world is through their suffering.
[2453.68 --> 2464.24]  I wonder how that connects with your life at the moment and with our world in your heart and prayers at the moment.
[2464.24 --> 2472.82]  On the night that Jesus was betrayed, he took bread and having broke it, he said,
[2472.92 --> 2475.22]  This is my body given for you.
[2478.16 --> 2482.54]  In the same way Jesus took the cup, he said,
[2482.74 --> 2487.16]  This is the new covenant in my blood for the forgiveness of sins.
[2487.16 --> 2491.98]  Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[2494.28 --> 2501.94]  I invite you to pass the bread to one another and to hold the bread in your hands.
[2503.56 --> 2504.74]  Let's feed on Jesus.
[2505.70 --> 2506.30]  Jesus said,
[2506.30 --> 2507.22]  Take me.
[2507.22 --> 2537.04]  Be strengthened for the journey, sisters.
[2537.22 --> 2537.80]  Brothers and brothers.
[2538.74 --> 2539.40]  Let's drink.
[2549.54 --> 2553.02]  As we receive your body and your blood,
[2554.26 --> 2557.64]  the strength for our lives and strength for the world,
[2558.50 --> 2560.66]  we praise you, risen lamb,
[2561.18 --> 2563.02]  that you are worthy to open,
[2563.78 --> 2566.00]  that you secure the good future
[2566.00 --> 2567.84]  that you have for this world.
[2568.48 --> 2569.30]  And we trust you.
[2570.54 --> 2570.92]  Amen.
[2574.04 --> 2576.82]  Will you stand with us as we raise a hallelujah together?
[2576.82 --> 2576.94]  Amen.
[2576.94 --> 2577.24]  Yay.
