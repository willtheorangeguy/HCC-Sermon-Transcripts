[0.00 --> 2.80]  Good morning, Hope.
[3.50 --> 7.50]  It's my privilege to welcome you once again to our Sunday morning service.
[8.20 --> 12.06]  And I want to, yeah, welcome you to our first Sunday of this Lent season.
[12.80 --> 14.80]  And so with that in mind, I have...
[22.38 --> 23.58]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[23.92 --> 26.64]  It is good to gather around God's Word again this morning.
[26.64 --> 31.84]  And I should just note, I know many of you were expecting this to be Pastor Sid's celebration
[31.84 --> 32.26]  service.
[32.36 --> 37.94]  This week he turned 65, and it's also 25 years where he and Candy served and continue to serve
[37.94 --> 38.38]  at Hope.
[39.16 --> 40.88]  But Sid's not feeling great still.
[40.98 --> 45.56]  He's struggling with some dizziness and vertigo, and so we just decided to delay that celebration
[45.56 --> 48.48]  to a time where he can enjoy it a little more fully, hopefully next week.
[48.92 --> 53.22]  And we encourage you to pray just that he would be restored and back to good health again.
[53.22 --> 56.66]  We're going to continue our series in Apprenticing with Jesus.
[57.00 --> 61.66]  And as I mentioned last week, for the next four weeks leading up to Easter, we're going
[61.66 --> 65.98]  to be looking at four specific practices, four specific spiritual disciplines that ground
[65.98 --> 68.74]  us in grace, that fill us with the life of the Spirit.
[69.32 --> 73.94]  And if you heard last week's message, you'll know that there's like 15 or 17 spiritual disciplines,
[74.26 --> 76.66]  and we've had to select four, so we've been very selective.
[76.66 --> 82.70]  And if you're new to this talk of spiritual disciplines or practices or habits, I do commend
[82.70 --> 83.48]  you some good reading.
[83.84 --> 87.86]  Some of the books that we've enjoyed are The Celebration of Discipline by Richard Foster,
[88.22 --> 92.08]  as well as the book that Val mentioned, which is The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry by John
[92.08 --> 94.52]  Mark Comer, who you're going to hear a bit of this morning.
[95.42 --> 99.36]  We're going to be looking first at silence and solitude, and more than one person joked
[99.36 --> 103.70]  with me that I should just leave us in 30 minutes of silence, and so we're going to
[103.70 --> 104.12]  do that.
[104.12 --> 109.40]  My jokes are worse when the building is empty, but I invite you to turn with me to Mark chapter
[109.40 --> 116.46]  1, and we're going to read again of Jesus modeling this for us, starting in verse 32.
[118.34 --> 123.44]  That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.
[124.06 --> 129.10]  The whole town gathered at the door, and Jesus healed many who had various diseases.
[129.82 --> 134.06]  He also drove out many demons, but he wouldn't let the demons speak because they knew who he
[134.06 --> 134.44]  was.
[135.56 --> 141.76]  Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went
[141.76 --> 143.68]  off to a solitary place where he prayed.
[144.54 --> 148.44]  Simon and his companions went to look for him, and when they found him, they exclaimed,
[148.44 --> 151.44]  everyone is looking for you.
[153.02 --> 153.94]  We'll leave it there.
[158.72 --> 160.82]  A writer by the name of Letty Kalman.
[160.82 --> 165.84]  I'll just wait one sec.
[165.84 --> 166.50]  Is that better?
[168.24 --> 173.64]  A writer by the name of Letty Kalman tells the story of an English traveler and explorer who
[173.64 --> 176.66]  wanted to explore the jungle in Central Africa.
[177.32 --> 180.70]  This is at the height of colonialism, and one of the first things he did was hire some local
[180.70 --> 184.10]  African men to lead the way and guide him into the jungle that they knew.
[184.96 --> 189.12]  On the first day, they packed their bags, and they made this arduous journey on foot as
[189.12 --> 191.80]  long as they could walk, and then as soon as night fell, they rested.
[192.58 --> 196.84]  The next morning, this English explorer woke up very early, hoping to make as good of time
[196.84 --> 201.52]  and speed, but he found that these African men that were leading him were not willing to
[201.52 --> 201.76]  go.
[202.26 --> 204.80]  In fact, they were there, they were awake, but they didn't want a journey.
[205.50 --> 206.54]  And he was frustrated by that.
[206.58 --> 207.60]  He said, okay, it's time to go.
[207.60 --> 208.22]  And they said, no.
[209.12 --> 210.30]  And he pleaded with them.
[210.62 --> 211.38]  He begged them.
[211.46 --> 215.70]  He even tried to bribe them so that they would go with him on this journey into the forest.
[215.80 --> 218.72]  And finally, when nothing seemed to work, he said to them, what gives?
[219.32 --> 221.52]  Why aren't you willing to go with me into the jungle?
[222.34 --> 227.20]  And one spoke on behalf of the group, and he said, we're waiting for our souls to catch
[227.20 --> 228.20]  up with our bodies.
[230.84 --> 233.82]  They had this sense that the pace of their journey was too quick.
[233.82 --> 238.20]  It was unhealthy for them, and so they took the time to rest.
[239.68 --> 244.30]  There's a diagnosis that doctors and health professionals have given many people who live
[244.30 --> 248.12]  in our modern world, and it's a diagnosis called hurry sickness.
[248.42 --> 249.12]  Have you heard of it before?
[250.14 --> 254.18]  It was originally coined by a doctor, actually a cardiologist, who was looking at all the symptoms
[254.18 --> 256.24]  that would lead people to have heart attacks.
[256.96 --> 259.02]  And this is how hurry sickness is described.
[259.66 --> 260.72]  You might not like this.
[260.72 --> 266.22]  It's a behavior pattern characterized by continual rushing and anxiousness.
[266.84 --> 272.42]  A continuous struggle, an unremitting attempt to accomplish and achieve more and more things
[272.42 --> 274.28]  in less and less time.
[275.80 --> 283.20]  Hurry sickness includes symptoms like irritability, hypersensitivity, restlessness, workaholism,
[283.72 --> 288.66]  a lack of care for the body, and escapist behaviors to alcohol and other vices.
[288.66 --> 291.22]  Here's the real zinger for me.
[291.88 --> 294.10]  Hurry sickness was coined in the 1950s.
[294.90 --> 300.26]  Imagine with me how a doctor of the 1950s might look at our society today.
[301.36 --> 306.44]  Perhaps the question isn't whether you and I are hurry sick, but how hurry sick we really
[306.44 --> 306.98]  are.
[306.98 --> 315.68]  Pretty much every study, every pull done on our life in North America, our life in the
[315.68 --> 317.42]  digital world comes to the same conclusion.
[318.00 --> 321.74]  We're living at speeds, at paces, and with a lifestyle that's not healthy, sustainable,
[321.92 --> 323.00]  it's downright toxic.
[323.72 --> 328.20]  In fact, John Mark Homer, who we referenced already, he describes the hurry of our society
[328.20 --> 330.62]  in these very bald terms.
[330.62 --> 335.04]  He writes, hurry kills all that we hold dear.
[335.98 --> 343.48]  Spirituality, health, marriage, family, thoughtful work, creativity, generosity, name your value.
[344.34 --> 349.50]  Hurry is a sociopathic predator on the loose in our society.
[349.50 --> 352.42]  That's quite a statement.
[353.52 --> 357.54]  There's another quote by John Mark Homer that finds its way throughout the Groen home in
[357.54 --> 362.46]  specifically busy moments where we say to one another, you can't love people well when
[362.46 --> 363.54]  you're in a hurry.
[364.72 --> 365.36]  Think about it.
[365.68 --> 369.20]  Think of that work meeting where you're trying to rush through so you can get on to your next
[369.20 --> 369.80]  Zoom call.
[370.08 --> 374.06]  Think of the dinner you're trying to get done so you can catch the game on time.
[374.06 --> 379.52]  Think of the famous example of how well you love your family when you're stuffing your
[379.52 --> 384.16]  kids into the car so you can get to that event or even church on time.
[385.38 --> 390.44]  I think one of the greatest ironies or perhaps tragedies of the 21st century in which we live
[390.44 --> 396.28]  is that we have all these advancements, all these technologies, all these inventions that
[396.28 --> 401.16]  are supposed to make our lives easier, faster, simpler, more convenient.
[401.16 --> 403.40]  I mean, think of the last app you downloaded.
[403.40 --> 405.78]  It's probably something that promised to make your life better.
[406.08 --> 415.16]  And yet here we are, more anxious, more restless, more sleepless, and more lonely than previous
[415.16 --> 415.70]  generations.
[416.60 --> 417.86]  Everything at our disposal.
[418.76 --> 423.14]  And here we are with this deep nagging sense when our head hits the pillow at night that
[423.14 --> 428.38]  our life is out of shape, that our pace is unhealthy, that our relationships are not
[428.38 --> 428.78]  healthy.
[428.78 --> 434.22]  And I think even more painful perhaps is the reality that often we try to slow down.
[434.42 --> 435.84]  We try to balance out.
[435.92 --> 438.26]  We try to find a better pace in our lives.
[438.32 --> 441.10]  And when we get that free time, what's the first thing we do?
[441.68 --> 443.50]  What's the first thing you do when you get free time?
[444.50 --> 450.16]  You pull out this distraction device that hits you with just enough dopamine, just enough app
[450.16 --> 453.54]  notifications to make you feel like it's actually not all that bad.
[453.54 --> 455.54]  That's our context.
[455.54 --> 456.16]  That's our context.
[457.16 --> 462.08]  And we return to ask the question that we started this series with some 11 weeks ago.
[462.40 --> 467.02]  Could it be that one of the most important things Jesus does in his earthly ministry is
[467.02 --> 474.36]  teach his apprentices a new way of living, a new pace of living, new practices that lead
[474.36 --> 479.40]  to the flourishing of human life in tune with how we were created and in tune with how we
[479.40 --> 481.66]  will be recreated when Jesus returns?
[481.66 --> 486.12]  Could it be that one of the things the first apprentices of Jesus had to learn was breaking
[486.12 --> 491.38]  dangerous, destructive, toxic habits of the first century and relearning new habits in
[491.38 --> 492.42]  line with the kingdom of God?
[492.54 --> 501.22]  Habits like Sabbath, prayer, mercy, hospitality, and silence, and solitude.
[502.02 --> 506.66]  That these were the new ways, the new waters they would swim in if they wanted to be in the
[506.66 --> 511.10]  life of Jesus, the flourishing life that they were created for.
[511.66 --> 516.18]  I want to read for us again the passage.
[516.18 --> 522.68]  That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.
[523.32 --> 528.08]  The whole town gathered at the door, and Jesus healed many who had various diseases.
[528.60 --> 532.78]  He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who
[532.78 --> 533.30]  he was.
[534.22 --> 540.44]  Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went
[540.44 --> 542.52]  off to a solitary place where he prayed.
[543.66 --> 546.96]  Simon and his companions went to look for him, and when they found him, they exclaimed,
[547.18 --> 549.24]  everyone is looking for you.
[550.44 --> 551.44]  Can you picture that scene?
[552.42 --> 557.68]  I picture Simon and the other disciples finding Jesus and actually being frustrated.
[558.80 --> 561.54]  It's like, Jesus, do you understand what's happening right now?
[561.54 --> 564.40]  People have left their own towns.
[565.06 --> 570.90]  They have traveled a great deal of land on foot with their sickness, with their illness
[570.90 --> 572.12]  for you, Jesus.
[572.68 --> 576.20]  They're at your door because of what you can say, what you can do.
[576.42 --> 578.42]  And what are you doing here?
[579.82 --> 581.40]  It reminds me a little bit of movies.
[581.50 --> 585.26]  And oftentimes what happens in a movie, someone becomes very popular or they have a superpower of
[585.26 --> 589.46]  some kind, and then at their house, they're sort of inside their house and surrounding
[589.46 --> 594.04]  their home is the camera crews, the microphones, the television channel, and they're trapped.
[594.12 --> 596.14]  But in this scene, Jesus isn't even in the house.
[596.66 --> 597.30]  He's left.
[597.68 --> 602.76]  He went early in the morning in the dark to a solitary place where he was alone with the
[602.76 --> 604.02]  Father in prayer.
[604.88 --> 607.28]  You might say it's a ministry trifecta of Jesus.
[607.58 --> 611.74]  Silence, solitude, communion in prayer with the Father.
[615.26 --> 618.60]  This is a repeated thing for Jesus and his ministry.
[618.72 --> 622.90]  And I mentioned last week how in the Gospel of Luke we see repeated over and over and over
[622.90 --> 626.68]  again, Jesus in the height of ministry, in the height of all the demands, withdrawing
[626.68 --> 629.10]  from the crowds and being with the Father.
[629.78 --> 633.22]  But I want us to see this morning that it's actually not only a practice of Jesus.
[633.84 --> 637.18]  We see it very quickly in the ministry of the disciples as well.
[638.04 --> 642.48]  In Mark chapter 6, just a few chapters later, Jesus has commissioned and he sent out his disciples
[642.48 --> 645.96]  to teach the kingdom, to announce the kingdom, to do healing in his name.
[646.20 --> 648.70]  And they're finding that their ministry is flourishing.
[649.14 --> 650.24]  People are hearing the good news.
[650.34 --> 651.66]  They're having their sick healed.
[651.92 --> 654.18]  People are coming to them to hear the good news of Jesus.
[654.52 --> 657.38]  It's an exciting and powerful time of ministry.
[657.92 --> 660.90]  And I want to read for you what Mark records about this time of ministry.
[661.02 --> 662.48]  This is Mark 6, chapter 30.
[664.48 --> 669.48]  The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all that they had done and taught.
[669.56 --> 671.66]  You can just imagine the excitement of these disciples here.
[671.66 --> 672.58]  We're doing it, Jesus.
[672.66 --> 673.68]  We're following in your way.
[674.44 --> 678.66]  Then, because so many people were coming and going that they didn't even have a chance to eat,
[680.66 --> 687.04]  he said to them, come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.
[687.50 --> 691.64]  So they went by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.
[693.66 --> 695.86]  That's apprenticeship right there.
[696.78 --> 697.56]  Do you see what's happening?
[697.56 --> 702.82]  The disciples are now, in their own way, experiencing the demands, all the attention they're receiving
[702.82 --> 704.64]  because of what they believe, what they're proclaiming.
[704.80 --> 707.38]  And now they're feeling all the pressure that Jesus himself felt.
[707.56 --> 710.56]  And the very thing Jesus did, he's now putting on them.
[711.34 --> 712.92]  Apprenticeship is, come, Matthew.
[713.44 --> 714.26]  Come, Levi.
[714.94 --> 716.16]  Come, Simon.
[716.34 --> 717.40]  I want you to get in the boat.
[718.08 --> 719.30]  I want you to be by yourselves.
[720.12 --> 720.96]  I want you to rest.
[720.96 --> 724.08]  Do you see apprenticeship that way?
[724.20 --> 728.98]  Jesus literally bringing his disciples and saying, all right, time to get away from the crowds.
[729.78 --> 730.38]  You haven't eaten.
[731.14 --> 732.14]  The demands are great.
[732.84 --> 733.86]  And I want you to rest.
[734.50 --> 735.38]  I want you to be alone.
[736.10 --> 737.38]  I want you to be away from the pressures.
[738.98 --> 742.66]  I want to ask the question, a very basic question, why does Jesus do this?
[742.66 --> 748.42]  Why would he take the time to pull them away from the very good pressures of ministry,
[748.68 --> 751.20]  the good things that are happening, the kingdom that's breaking in,
[751.46 --> 754.64]  and push them off to this time of silence and rest?
[755.72 --> 757.24]  I think there's a number of reasons.
[757.42 --> 764.00]  And just a few that come to my mind are, one, Jesus knows the pressure and the exhaustion of ministry.
[764.98 --> 769.20]  He himself knew what it was like to have the door filled with people on the other side,
[769.36 --> 772.18]  wanting healing, wanting time, wanting teaching.
[772.18 --> 774.16]  He knows the exhaustion of ministry.
[774.26 --> 777.50]  And these disciples themselves didn't even eat because there was so much happening.
[778.88 --> 781.62]  But he also knew the temptation of ministry.
[782.76 --> 785.18]  He knew that these disciples were just humans like anyone else,
[785.22 --> 788.18]  and they had newfound powers, newfound authority in Jesus,
[788.30 --> 791.28]  newfound ability to do things they did not previously do.
[791.32 --> 795.14]  And there's temptation there to perhaps make a name for themselves,
[796.08 --> 798.46]  to perhaps show their own significance.
[798.46 --> 805.92]  But perhaps even deeper, Jesus, who is there at the beginning of the creation of the human person,
[806.36 --> 807.52]  knew how we were formed.
[808.26 --> 813.34]  And he knew that no disciple, no human, is meant to live at a pace of perpetual busyness,
[813.62 --> 817.62]  living at perpetual demands, skipping through meals, blowing through Sabbath,
[817.94 --> 820.04]  for the sake of the needs right in front of them.
[820.04 --> 824.16]  And what he's doing when he invites them into the boat to get away from the crowds is saying,
[824.52 --> 833.92]  you were created for this pace of life, of work and rest, of community and solitude,
[834.60 --> 837.46]  of service and silence.
[837.46 --> 843.56]  And in your apprenticeship with me, I want you to follow in the very way you were created for,
[843.64 --> 850.22]  the very way I'm patterning for you, and that includes silence and solitude and communion with the Father.
[850.74 --> 857.32]  And it's through those practices that you will discover his love, his mercy, and his power
[857.32 --> 859.98]  to do what you've been called to do.
[859.98 --> 867.16]  Now, one of the things I love about Mark chapter 6 is the humanness of it.
[867.20 --> 872.10]  If you read on, you'll find out that when people saw Jesus putting his disciples in the boat to go to the quiet place,
[872.28 --> 877.88]  they actually ran out of their villages on foot ahead of them to the place where the boat was going to land on the water
[877.88 --> 882.74]  so that they could continue to receive Jesus' teaching and continue to receive his healing power.
[883.48 --> 887.42]  And I love the adaptability of Jesus and also the compassion of Jesus,
[887.54 --> 889.86]  because when he got there and he saw the crowds, you know what he did?
[890.58 --> 891.18]  He fed them.
[892.32 --> 893.14]  He taught them.
[893.34 --> 898.04]  He delayed the plan so that the crowds could hear the good news and be fed.
[899.02 --> 905.40]  But notice that right after the story, the famous story of the feeding of the 5,000 that happens in Mark chapter 6,
[905.46 --> 907.26]  I want you to hear how it finishes.
[908.18 --> 909.94]  Verse 45, chapter 6.
[910.68 --> 917.82]  Immediately, Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to Bethsaida while he dismissed the crowd.
[917.82 --> 922.32]  After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.
[923.94 --> 925.64]  Now, are you catching the rhythm here?
[926.12 --> 927.54]  I'm being painfully redundant.
[928.34 --> 931.92]  This rhythm that Jesus embodies, the rhythm he brings his apprentices into,
[932.02 --> 937.48]  work and rest of ministry, silence, of being in the midst of all the good pressures of ministry,
[937.48 --> 943.64]  and then being alone in solitude with the Father to restore strength,
[943.64 --> 950.40]  to listen and discern, to gain wisdom, and to be grounded again and again in his presence.
[950.40 --> 959.16]  I want to read again that verse that we talked about last week from Luke 5, 16,
[959.46 --> 962.00]  that says so much about the rhythm of Jesus' ministry.
[962.36 --> 967.48]  But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.
[967.76 --> 971.48]  Can that be said of the church of Jesus here in Clayton Heights?
[972.04 --> 973.20]  Could it be said of Hope Community Church?
[973.26 --> 974.20]  Hey, I've gotten to know this church.
[974.20 --> 978.26]  These people often retreat to lonely places and they pray.
[979.34 --> 981.28]  It's a question worth spending time with.
[982.48 --> 987.44]  One writer can correlate in the Gospel of Luke, which records Jesus' prayer more than the other gospel accounts,
[987.76 --> 989.80]  that there is an increase of Jesus' busyness.
[989.94 --> 994.24]  As the increase happens, so does the increase of Jesus' withdrawal for solitary prayer.
[994.70 --> 995.62]  There's a link there.
[996.00 --> 1001.38]  As the demands go up, so does the time alone with the Father for restoration, wisdom, and power.
[1001.38 --> 1006.70]  And of course, I want to point out how contrary to our own way of being this is.
[1007.16 --> 1008.20]  Think about your own life.
[1008.94 --> 1014.90]  Think about the demands that come into your life with your family or your friendships or work or relationships that get complicated.
[1015.18 --> 1018.76]  What's the first thing you and I let go of when life gets busy?
[1019.10 --> 1019.86]  What's the first thing?
[1021.24 --> 1021.72]  Devotions?
[1022.82 --> 1023.12]  Prayer?
[1024.38 --> 1024.82]  Time?
[1025.08 --> 1026.58]  Quiet with the Father?
[1026.58 --> 1035.38]  I know so often in my own life there is a great pressure to get that laptop open, to get those emails going,
[1035.52 --> 1041.20]  so that I can get busy again in the midst of times that are demanding, rather than leaving that lid closed,
[1042.20 --> 1045.20]  finding that prayer chair, and being with the Father.
[1050.06 --> 1054.96]  Perhaps it's worth saying a few words now about the practice of silence and solitude itself.
[1054.96 --> 1058.04]  First, I want to differentiate, and this is an important one.
[1058.14 --> 1062.14]  I want to differentiate between silence and solitude as we see in Jesus' ministry and the disciples' ministry,
[1062.54 --> 1065.32]  and what often we think of in today's context.
[1065.94 --> 1068.88]  Right now, there's two popular things that are called meditation and mindfulness,
[1069.42 --> 1071.68]  and silence and solitude is not the same.
[1072.56 --> 1077.14]  The purpose of silence and solitude in the Scriptures is so that we commune with the Father,
[1077.76 --> 1080.44]  that we listen to Him, that we pray with Him,
[1080.44 --> 1085.58]  that we are in His presence, and we are just drawing strength from Him and His love and His presence.
[1085.88 --> 1092.00]  Whereas often mindfulness, as we hear it today, is often just being with yourself, speaking to yourself.
[1092.58 --> 1097.44]  And so much of what I'm reading about mindfulness and meditation right now is really just an echo chamber of you talking with you.
[1097.86 --> 1102.48]  And of course, it identifies that we have an unhealthy pace of life, the importance of being silenced by ourselves,
[1102.48 --> 1108.92]  but the difference we see in Jesus' ministry is that the center of the practice is the living God.
[1109.62 --> 1112.58]  The center of the practice is His presence.
[1113.12 --> 1116.18]  The center of the practice is hearing from Him.
[1116.68 --> 1119.38]  This is not just an echo chamber where we're by ourselves.
[1121.18 --> 1125.24]  And silence, in our context, should be explained a little more as well.
[1125.34 --> 1128.44]  When we talk about silence and solitude, we really do mean silence.
[1128.44 --> 1131.72]  No headphones with our favorite music.
[1132.02 --> 1133.62]  No TV buzz in the background.
[1133.74 --> 1135.48]  No Netflix show playing quietly.
[1135.70 --> 1137.40]  No roommate playing video games.
[1137.56 --> 1140.70]  And no phone notifications.
[1141.50 --> 1144.58]  Just in the last two weeks, I'm on Zoom a lot, just like the rest of us,
[1144.70 --> 1149.06]  and I've noticed how often the screen will shift, not because someone's talking, but because what?
[1149.50 --> 1150.86]  Their phone is dinging.
[1151.90 --> 1157.68]  I'm struck by how, even as pastors, our conversations are being taken away by someone's phone going off,
[1157.68 --> 1160.34]  and then they're sitting there like, on the Zoom call.
[1161.68 --> 1165.60]  And this is a bit of a sidebar, but I will reference John Mark Comer again here.
[1166.24 --> 1170.74]  There's a few of us on staff and also throughout our church who are doing this practice called dumb phoning.
[1171.16 --> 1172.94]  It is the opposite of smart phoning.
[1173.50 --> 1177.30]  And dumb phoning is the practice of taking notifications off your phone completely,
[1177.44 --> 1178.58]  no notifications at all.
[1179.06 --> 1181.28]  It is turning off anything that dings.
[1181.46 --> 1185.52]  It's also getting rid of all social media and deleting, you're going to love this,
[1185.52 --> 1187.08]  deleting work email.
[1188.04 --> 1191.22]  And the goal of dumb phoning is restorative.
[1191.96 --> 1197.12]  And the results so far that I've gotten back from other people who are on this journey with me are all very good.
[1197.20 --> 1200.92]  In fact, there's a sense of liberation from that next work email,
[1201.32 --> 1205.12]  liberation from that next notification on social media that really doesn't matter.
[1206.08 --> 1207.50]  Join us in dumb phoning.
[1207.50 --> 1212.40]  But I really do think that that last one of controlling our phones and getting rid of the noise
[1212.40 --> 1215.74]  is one of the greatest challenges for the younger generation in our community
[1215.74 --> 1218.18]  because we're raised with the wires.
[1218.32 --> 1219.54]  We're raised with the noise.
[1219.82 --> 1221.56]  We're raised with the social media clutter.
[1223.06 --> 1224.26]  Hear these ominous words.
[1224.44 --> 1226.22]  C.S. Lewis in his book, The Screwtape Letters,
[1226.52 --> 1229.34]  when he describes the tactics of Satan, the evil one,
[1229.34 --> 1234.16]  he describes how the goal of Satan, the sort of end goal of the evil one in the end
[1234.16 --> 1238.10]  is to make the whole universe, quote, a kingdom of noise.
[1239.32 --> 1245.00]  So distracting, so cluttered with a cacophony of noise that you can't discern the presence of God
[1245.00 --> 1247.80]  and you can't hear the voice of the Good Shepherd.
[1249.24 --> 1251.04]  A kingdom of noise.
[1251.20 --> 1255.68]  And I keep thinking, how might C.S. Lewis interact with the world of social media?
[1255.68 --> 1261.90]  The clutter of all the voices, all the yelling, all the posting.
[1264.12 --> 1266.70]  For some of us, though, this practice of silence and solitude
[1266.70 --> 1269.44]  isn't even about controlling our busy schedules.
[1269.54 --> 1271.72]  And I think right now we have this wonderful opportunity
[1271.72 --> 1273.32]  where our schedules are a little less busy.
[1273.42 --> 1275.12]  We can hit the reset button on our habits.
[1275.84 --> 1278.20]  For some of us, finding silent time isn't even hard.
[1278.32 --> 1280.88]  Perhaps you're empty nesters and your house is quieter than it's ever been.
[1281.22 --> 1284.98]  I think there's a reason why we don't practice this that runs a little deeper.
[1285.68 --> 1288.26]  And I think that reason is we're hiding.
[1289.50 --> 1292.50]  There's a sense, I think, even in some of us right now who are listening,
[1292.84 --> 1295.60]  that we'd prefer to be busy, we'd prefer to be in a hurry,
[1295.68 --> 1298.28]  we'd prefer to run through the race of our lives and our work
[1298.28 --> 1301.70]  because we don't want to deal with what we might find
[1301.70 --> 1306.20]  if we're quiet in the presence of the living God.
[1307.36 --> 1310.50]  We don't want to face some of the mess, some of the decisions we've made,
[1310.58 --> 1312.68]  some of the broken pieces of our lives that we are ashamed of.
[1312.68 --> 1313.92]  We'd rather not go there.
[1313.96 --> 1317.60]  Put the lid on that and we'll just be happy with our busyness.
[1319.22 --> 1320.76]  I want to read for us a quote.
[1320.86 --> 1321.78]  This comes from Louis Boyer.
[1321.84 --> 1323.60]  This was written a number of years ago.
[1323.98 --> 1327.06]  And the first time I read it, it just gave me this chilling sense of relevance.
[1327.72 --> 1328.28]  He writes,
[1328.28 --> 1358.28] 
[1358.28 --> 1369.06]  But let me pivot to encourage us.
[1369.06 --> 1375.44]  Those who seek to be alone in the presence of God,
[1375.86 --> 1382.00]  to find that lonely place in His presence, find Him in it.
[1382.66 --> 1384.58]  And when they find the heart of the Father,
[1384.70 --> 1387.20]  they will always find what Psalm 100 says,
[1387.20 --> 1390.88]  The Lord is gracious, He is compassionate, He is slow to anger,
[1391.12 --> 1394.42]  He is abounding in love, He does not treat us as our sins deserve,
[1394.68 --> 1397.00]  for as far as the east is from the west,
[1397.58 --> 1401.06]  so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
[1401.90 --> 1405.30]  And in Christ, we say to that, Amen.
[1405.30 --> 1411.20]  Those of us who seek to find God in that silent, solitary space,
[1411.78 --> 1413.10]  find grace.
[1414.26 --> 1417.98]  They find mercy, strength,
[1418.54 --> 1423.38]  the empowering presence of the Spirit who walks with us in the mess.
[1423.70 --> 1424.72]  And don't we want this?
[1425.48 --> 1429.82]  Don't you want God to stand in the middle of all the crazy pieces of your life?
[1430.04 --> 1432.94]  Don't you want His guiding strength and His empowering presence
[1432.94 --> 1435.40]  to be there in those relationships that are difficult,
[1435.66 --> 1437.14]  the context of work that's difficult?
[1437.24 --> 1441.34]  Don't you want to bring Him in to those places of brokenness and shame
[1441.34 --> 1445.40]  so that we can be healed and renewed and transformed
[1445.40 --> 1447.14]  in the grace of Jesus Christ?
[1447.24 --> 1448.48]  Don't you ache for that?
[1449.54 --> 1452.68]  I ache for our church to be that community.
[1453.14 --> 1455.42]  Enough hiding, enough putting things to the side,
[1455.50 --> 1456.70]  enough wishing God didn't see it,
[1456.70 --> 1458.84]  and allowing Him into those places
[1458.84 --> 1464.06]  so that we can be transformed by His love and His grace.
[1467.38 --> 1471.46]  Those who practice silence and solitude in the presence of God
[1471.46 --> 1473.10]  never seem to regret it.
[1473.54 --> 1475.52]  And again, I've talked to a number of people in our church
[1475.52 --> 1478.14]  and other churches who are really intentional about this,
[1478.30 --> 1479.28]  and I've never heard them say,
[1479.36 --> 1480.84]  Oh man, I wish I worked instead.
[1481.36 --> 1482.80]  I wish I did this instead.
[1482.88 --> 1484.56]  I wish I went and did CrossFit instead.
[1484.56 --> 1488.40]  There's a sense in which when you start practicing time in God's presence,
[1488.54 --> 1490.00]  the living God's presence,
[1490.36 --> 1491.88]  it gives you a hunger for more.
[1492.64 --> 1495.04]  You want more of Him and more of your life.
[1495.12 --> 1497.36]  You want less of your own sinful control
[1497.36 --> 1500.26]  and more of His loving, faithful control.
[1501.34 --> 1504.24]  There's a hunger that happens as you start to practice this.
[1504.30 --> 1506.46]  And if you don't believe me, take baby steps.
[1507.14 --> 1509.16]  Perhaps just spend some time in the prayer room this week
[1509.16 --> 1510.34]  that we put up in the church
[1510.34 --> 1512.22]  and see where God takes you.
[1512.22 --> 1517.54]  I want to spend a few minutes just encouraging us
[1517.54 --> 1519.70]  in practical ways in this practice.
[1520.50 --> 1522.74]  I feel like a sermon like this is fruitful
[1522.74 --> 1524.44]  as we actually do it,
[1524.48 --> 1526.18]  as we practice what we're preaching on here.
[1526.76 --> 1528.00]  And so just a few ideas.
[1528.16 --> 1530.56]  One of them comes from a person named Jeremy Olim.
[1530.76 --> 1531.74]  I quoted him last week,
[1532.06 --> 1534.94]  and I've heard him do some teaching on solitude and silence.
[1535.04 --> 1537.34]  And one of the things that he mentioned in that teaching
[1537.34 --> 1539.66]  that I found really fruitful is how for him,
[1539.94 --> 1541.86]  the way he does silence and solitude
[1541.86 --> 1543.24]  is prayer walking.
[1543.86 --> 1545.88]  And I know a lot of us probably are open to this
[1545.88 --> 1547.74]  because we're so tired of being in our homes
[1547.74 --> 1548.86]  for work and everything else.
[1549.40 --> 1551.26]  But for Jeremy, he does prayer walking,
[1551.36 --> 1553.96]  and he sees it as three ways that he does his prayer walk.
[1554.04 --> 1556.24]  Sometimes he starts, or oftentimes he starts,
[1556.28 --> 1558.56]  just by saying, God, here I am.
[1559.50 --> 1561.72]  I desire to be in your presence.
[1562.56 --> 1564.24]  I desire to hear from you.
[1564.80 --> 1566.88]  Would you be present to me in this walk?
[1566.88 --> 1568.32]  So simple starting of that prayer.
[1568.32 --> 1571.30]  And sometimes his mind just goes to all sorts of places.
[1571.42 --> 1574.10]  It's sort of like a wild prayer where as he thinks about things,
[1574.16 --> 1576.90]  he just invites God to speak, to instruct, to encourage.
[1577.54 --> 1582.02]  Other times he deliberately, he will call it like a project-based prayer walk
[1582.02 --> 1584.18]  where you've got a certain issue in your family
[1584.18 --> 1586.82]  or a certain issue at work that you want to work through in his presence.
[1587.08 --> 1588.88]  And you ask God questions, and you listen,
[1589.14 --> 1592.04]  and you just pay attention to what's going on inside of you
[1592.04 --> 1593.98]  as you work through challenges with him.
[1593.98 --> 1598.16]  And the third kind of prayer walk that he encourages and does in his own life
[1598.16 --> 1601.70]  is meditation, where you perhaps bring a verse of Scripture
[1601.70 --> 1602.92]  or you read some Scripture,
[1603.42 --> 1605.22]  and then you spend a whole hour walking
[1605.22 --> 1607.26]  and just asking God to teach you,
[1607.38 --> 1608.70]  what does that Scripture mean?
[1609.40 --> 1610.32]  What does it mean to live it?
[1610.74 --> 1611.66]  What does it mean to know it?
[1611.96 --> 1613.72]  How to embody that Scripture?
[1614.14 --> 1615.80]  Those are the three kinds of prayer walks he does.
[1615.86 --> 1618.90]  And perhaps the starting point for you in silence and solitude
[1618.90 --> 1620.34]  is actually getting out of your house
[1620.34 --> 1623.64]  and just walking around the city, spending time with your Father.
[1625.30 --> 1628.92]  Another thing, or another way of doing silence and solitude,
[1629.04 --> 1630.86]  this comes from a person I know in the business world
[1630.86 --> 1633.44]  who has dedicated a chair in his office
[1633.44 --> 1635.28]  that he calls the prayer chair.
[1636.30 --> 1639.68]  When he's in that chair, he is not doing his laptop work.
[1639.78 --> 1641.72]  When he's in that chair, he's not dealing with clients.
[1641.72 --> 1645.24]  In that chair, that specific chair, that's prayer time.
[1646.08 --> 1648.10]  And throughout the day, as he's dealing with different things,
[1648.16 --> 1649.10]  he's facing different challenges,
[1649.10 --> 1650.86]  so he plunks himself down in the chair and he says,
[1650.94 --> 1653.04]  all right, Lord, you know what I'm going through.
[1653.60 --> 1654.40]  You know my heart.
[1655.00 --> 1658.14]  I want to be together with you and listen as I struggle.
[1658.90 --> 1661.70]  Perhaps that's something that you can do in your own office space.
[1662.94 --> 1668.50]  Or my brother Sean, who commutes 35, 40 minutes every day to work.
[1669.62 --> 1671.76]  The radio never goes on in Sean's car.
[1672.72 --> 1674.86]  That drive is sacred space.
[1675.52 --> 1676.48]  It's listening time.
[1676.78 --> 1677.66]  It's prayer time.
[1677.66 --> 1680.44]  It's being intentional about this 40 minutes,
[1680.58 --> 1682.26]  or actually twice that every day,
[1682.80 --> 1684.70]  of being in the presence of the Father.
[1685.04 --> 1688.74]  Imagine how your posture at the beginning of your workday could change
[1688.74 --> 1694.12]  if you spent your first 40 minutes before you entered the doors in God's presence.
[1694.12 --> 1698.22]  Or my wife Brittany.
[1699.90 --> 1704.22]  Oftentimes when our kids come down in the morning to start their day,
[1704.32 --> 1708.06]  they see their mom on the couch with her prayer journal and with her Bible,
[1708.46 --> 1713.20]  and she realizes that for that life of silence, solitude, and prayer to happen in her life,
[1713.24 --> 1715.28]  it has to happen before the kids get up.
[1716.20 --> 1718.24]  And other parents, it's after the kids go to bed,
[1718.24 --> 1720.96]  or it's when they go off to school, whatever the case is,
[1720.96 --> 1726.88]  we organize times in our day, or we are alone with the Father.
[1727.46 --> 1730.46]  That's going to take different shapes in our lives.
[1731.52 --> 1735.00]  But the most important part, I think, is picking up your calendar and saying,
[1735.00 --> 1739.78]  if this really does allow me to be in the presence of my loving Heavenly Father,
[1740.58 --> 1744.92]  if by spending time with Him alone, I will grow as an apprentice,
[1745.52 --> 1750.20]  I will live in His presence, and I will discover the power of the Spirit working in me,
[1750.80 --> 1753.06]  how can I block on my calendar that time?
[1753.90 --> 1756.50]  What can I say no to so I can say yes to this?
[1756.64 --> 1758.68]  What can I reschedule so I can say yes to this?
[1758.72 --> 1763.98]  And again, COVID is an amazing season to start blocking these times off
[1763.98 --> 1768.68]  so that when the demands come, you've got a structure that allows for your health,
[1769.64 --> 1773.04]  for your heart, and for your life in Jesus.
[1775.22 --> 1780.84]  I want to finish by just imagining with you what it might look like for our church to be a church
[1780.84 --> 1787.16]  that follows the pattern of Jesus in finding retreat, solitude, and prayer.
[1788.40 --> 1792.52]  Imagine what it would look like for us to get to the, quote, weekend,
[1792.52 --> 1798.42]  and we're not exhausted by the demands, but refreshed,
[1798.76 --> 1801.92]  because our week has been punctuated by time with the Father.
[1803.00 --> 1808.62]  Imagine what it would look like in your home if that space had a regular place
[1808.62 --> 1813.36]  where people in your home were going to be alone with their Heavenly Father.
[1814.08 --> 1815.20]  What would our homes look like?
[1815.82 --> 1818.92]  What would our church community look like if all throughout the week,
[1818.92 --> 1823.36]  we were finding ways not just to pray for ourselves but intercede for our city,
[1823.96 --> 1826.96]  retreating for solitude and silence with our Heavenly Father?
[1828.52 --> 1830.36]  How might that transform us?
[1831.76 --> 1834.20]  How might that transform our city?
[1834.94 --> 1838.48]  As they see this peculiar community that's not exhausted,
[1839.04 --> 1841.44]  that's not living with this diagnosis of hurry sickness,
[1841.84 --> 1843.80]  that's not just racing from one thing to another,
[1844.06 --> 1846.62]  forgetting who they are, forgetting whose they are,
[1846.62 --> 1851.68]  but living with a sense of purpose, identity as those who have been freed by Jesus,
[1852.28 --> 1855.10]  a sense of clarity about how to live with wisdom
[1855.10 --> 1858.20]  in the complex situations that they find their lives in.
[1859.18 --> 1862.72]  What kind of questions might people ask of the church
[1862.72 --> 1865.76]  if they saw this new way of living,
[1866.48 --> 1871.12]  this rhythm of rest, solitude, and silence
[1871.12 --> 1874.58]  that allows us to re-engage and emerge into our cities
[1874.58 --> 1878.50]  with a sense of God's love and grace and power
[1878.50 --> 1880.54]  leading us and walking with us.
[1881.78 --> 1882.48]  Let's pray.
[1888.02 --> 1889.18]  Father, we pause
[1889.18 --> 1892.30]  to thank you for the way that you find us
[1892.30 --> 1896.46]  and that when we seek you,
[1896.84 --> 1898.68]  you are always there.
[1898.68 --> 1903.44]  we thank you for your faithfulness throughout the generations,
[1903.94 --> 1906.40]  for the way that even in our disobedience,
[1906.50 --> 1907.94]  you break through our clutter
[1907.94 --> 1909.80]  and you draw us to yourself.
[1912.22 --> 1914.14]  We thank you for this way of Jesus,
[1915.52 --> 1917.74]  this teaching on being silent
[1917.74 --> 1919.70]  in solitude with you.
[1919.70 --> 1923.92]  and we pray, Lord, you would teach us how to practice this.
[1925.28 --> 1926.96]  We pray that you'd give us the wisdom
[1926.96 --> 1929.12]  to know how to say no,
[1930.40 --> 1932.52]  to know how to put time aside
[1932.52 --> 1934.30]  to listen to you.
[1935.78 --> 1937.22]  Would you forgive us
[1937.22 --> 1939.66]  for the frantic pace of our lives?
[1941.34 --> 1943.94]  Would you teach us how to rest in your grace?
[1943.94 --> 1947.36]  And Father, we pray that you teach us
[1947.36 --> 1949.20]  how to listen to you
[1949.20 --> 1951.70]  and walk not in our own strength,
[1952.20 --> 1953.78]  but by the power of your Holy Spirit.
[1954.68 --> 1956.02]  All glory be to you.
[1956.86 --> 1957.16]  Amen.
[1960.94 --> 1962.84]  We've been nourished by God's word,
[1962.96 --> 1963.62]  and in just a moment,
[1963.70 --> 1965.02]  we're going to be nourished at the table.
[1966.00 --> 1967.24]  And what I'd like for you to do
[1967.24 --> 1968.60]  is just take some time
[1968.60 --> 1971.06]  to prepare the elements as a family
[1971.06 --> 1973.24]  and to pray as a family,
[1973.32 --> 1973.78]  as a couple,
[1973.98 --> 1976.38]  as whatever arrangement you're in this morning.
[1976.82 --> 1978.74]  We want to enter into this meal
[1978.74 --> 1979.90]  in an unhurried pace,
[1980.02 --> 1981.12]  practicing what we preach.
[1981.42 --> 1983.54]  And after the worship team plays some music,
[1983.66 --> 1985.86]  I will lead us through the Lord's Supper.
[1986.16 --> 1987.00]  Let's prepare together.
[1995.02 --> 2025.00]  Let's prepare together.
[2025.02 --> 2055.00]  Let's prepare together.
[2055.02 --> 2057.84]  Let's have to prepare together.
[2057.84 --> 2058.40]  Let's prepare together.
[2063.00 --> 2064.20]  Let's prepare together.
[2068.20 --> 2068.58]  Let's prepare together.
[2068.64 --> 2069.98]  Let's prepare together.
[2069.98 --> 2070.16]  Let's prepare together.
[2070.40 --> 2070.96]  Let's prepare together.
[2070.96 --> 2071.22]  Let's prepare together.
[2071.74 --> 2073.44]  Let's prepare together.
[2073.56 --> 2075.06]  Let's prepare together.
[2075.96 --> 2078.34]  Let's prepare together.
[2078.74 --> 2080.00]  Let's prepare together.
[2083.02 --> 2085.00]  Perhaps women are pretty weak.
[2085.00 --> 2087.00]  Amen.
[2115.00 --> 2132.30]  Before the end of Jesus' earthly ministry,
[2132.88 --> 2134.94]  the Gospels record for us one more time
[2134.94 --> 2137.86]  where he retreats to be alone with the Father.
[2138.82 --> 2141.20]  And this time, it's in a place called the Mount of Olives
[2141.20 --> 2142.36]  where his disciples are there
[2142.36 --> 2144.42]  and Jesus goes further ahead by himself
[2144.42 --> 2147.62]  and he spends needed time with the Father
[2147.62 --> 2149.40]  because Jesus knew why he came,
[2149.56 --> 2150.74]  he knew why he'd been sent,
[2151.30 --> 2153.92]  and he knew where the rest of his earthly life was going,
[2154.32 --> 2155.02]  to the cross.
[2155.82 --> 2157.70]  It's in that place where Jesus says,
[2158.10 --> 2159.84]  Lord, take this cup away from me.
[2161.42 --> 2163.90]  And he says, not my will, but yours be done.
[2165.36 --> 2166.82]  And from that prayer,
[2167.80 --> 2169.20]  Jesus gains the strength
[2169.20 --> 2171.52]  to allow himself to be arrested,
[2171.52 --> 2173.22]  betrayed,
[2174.32 --> 2174.84]  mocked,
[2175.62 --> 2176.80]  falsely accused,
[2176.98 --> 2178.40]  and finally crucified
[2178.40 --> 2180.66]  for his world
[2180.66 --> 2182.52]  and for us.
[2184.88 --> 2187.78]  As we prepare to go to the table this morning,
[2187.84 --> 2190.58]  I want to read words that come from Hebrews chapter 10.
[2190.58 --> 2195.28]  This is an encouragement for us to approach the throne of grace.
[2195.28 --> 2195.78]  We read,
[2195.78 --> 2197.18]  Therefore, brothers and sisters,
[2197.28 --> 2201.56]  since we have confidence to enter the most holy place
[2201.56 --> 2202.82]  by the blood of Jesus,
[2203.26 --> 2204.94]  by a new and living way,
[2205.06 --> 2206.76]  opened up to us through the curtain,
[2206.86 --> 2207.30]  that is,
[2207.64 --> 2208.32]  his body,
[2209.16 --> 2212.02]  and since we have a great high priest of the house of God,
[2212.54 --> 2215.46]  let us draw near to God
[2215.46 --> 2217.00]  with sincere hearts
[2217.00 --> 2219.66]  and with the full assurance that faith brings,
[2220.32 --> 2221.90]  having our hearts sprinkled
[2221.90 --> 2224.02]  to cleanse us from a guilty conscience
[2224.02 --> 2227.86]  and having our bodies washed with pure water.
[2228.90 --> 2232.16]  Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess,
[2232.72 --> 2235.22]  for he who promised is faithful.
[2235.22 --> 2241.26]  On the night that Jesus was betrayed,
[2242.30 --> 2245.10]  he was up with his disciples in the upper room,
[2245.80 --> 2247.92]  and they had a very ordinary meal,
[2248.58 --> 2249.34]  and during that meal,
[2249.42 --> 2250.34]  he takes the bread,
[2250.66 --> 2251.38]  after giving thanks,
[2251.44 --> 2253.00]  he breaks it and he says to his disciples,
[2253.88 --> 2255.46]  this is my body,
[2256.18 --> 2257.52]  given for you.
[2259.00 --> 2260.22]  In that same meal,
[2260.36 --> 2261.38]  Jesus takes the cup,
[2262.32 --> 2263.52]  and after he poured it out
[2263.52 --> 2265.24]  and given thanks,
[2266.54 --> 2267.58]  he said to his disciples,
[2267.90 --> 2268.88]  this is my blood,
[2269.84 --> 2270.86]  poured out for you.
[2271.66 --> 2274.14]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[2275.44 --> 2277.22]  And as the body of Christ
[2277.22 --> 2279.78]  gathered throughout the city this morning,
[2280.38 --> 2283.00]  we recognize that when we eat and drink this meal,
[2283.14 --> 2285.76]  we proclaim the victory of Jesus
[2285.76 --> 2286.50]  over sin,
[2287.42 --> 2288.10]  over Satan,
[2288.60 --> 2289.94]  and over death itself
[2289.94 --> 2291.66]  until he comes again.
[2291.66 --> 2293.26]  Through this meal,
[2293.36 --> 2293.98]  we remember,
[2294.42 --> 2295.42]  as Hebrews puts it,
[2295.46 --> 2297.94]  that we are washed with pure water.
[2298.98 --> 2300.48]  We are cleansed
[2300.48 --> 2301.74]  by the blood of Jesus,
[2302.22 --> 2303.64]  and we can enter
[2303.64 --> 2305.70]  into the very presence of God
[2305.70 --> 2307.18]  through his death and resurrection.
[2308.30 --> 2309.76]  So brothers and sisters,
[2310.96 --> 2311.36]  take,
[2312.42 --> 2312.78]  eat,
[2313.54 --> 2314.04]  remember,
[2314.18 --> 2314.74]  and believe
[2314.74 --> 2317.04]  that the body of Christ was given
[2317.04 --> 2318.86]  for the complete forgiveness
[2318.86 --> 2320.52]  of all our sin.
[2338.52 --> 2339.12]  Take,
[2340.12 --> 2341.00]  drink,
[2342.04 --> 2342.48]  remember,
[2342.48 --> 2343.04]  and believe
[2343.04 --> 2344.12]  that the blood of Christ
[2344.12 --> 2344.78]  was shed
[2344.78 --> 2346.30]  for the complete forgiveness
[2346.30 --> 2347.98]  of all our sins.
[2361.48 --> 2362.70]  Would you pray with me?
[2362.70 --> 2366.66]  Father,
[2366.74 --> 2367.50]  we receive
[2367.50 --> 2368.98]  this bread
[2368.98 --> 2370.34]  and this cup
[2370.34 --> 2371.96]  as a gift.
[2373.70 --> 2374.96]  As your body,
[2375.08 --> 2376.84]  we pray that you would nourish us
[2376.84 --> 2377.98]  in the life,
[2378.28 --> 2378.58]  death,
[2378.68 --> 2379.38]  and resurrection
[2379.38 --> 2380.04]  of Jesus.
[2381.20 --> 2382.10]  We pray
[2382.10 --> 2384.54]  that we would remember again
[2384.54 --> 2387.98]  that we are free,
[2387.98 --> 2391.18]  that you have paid it all,
[2392.28 --> 2393.22]  that you have
[2393.22 --> 2394.86]  risen victorious
[2394.86 --> 2395.78]  from the grave,
[2396.50 --> 2397.70]  and you rule
[2397.70 --> 2399.40]  over your world.
[2400.76 --> 2401.24]  Lord,
[2401.30 --> 2402.32]  would you nourish us
[2402.32 --> 2403.24]  again this morning
[2403.24 --> 2405.08]  that we are your people
[2405.08 --> 2407.00]  and that you have freed us
[2407.00 --> 2407.94]  by your cross.
[2408.98 --> 2409.96]  Thank you, Jesus.
[2410.88 --> 2411.22]  Amen.
[2413.62 --> 2415.02]  I invite you to stand
[2415.02 --> 2416.10]  and sing with us
[2416.10 --> 2417.32]  this closing song
[2417.32 --> 2417.88]  of Lent.
[2418.10 --> 2419.46]  Jesus paid it all.
