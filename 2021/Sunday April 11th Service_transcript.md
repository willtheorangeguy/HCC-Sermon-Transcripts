[0.00 --> 16.52]  thank you Val for the prayer
[16.52 --> 17.58]  thank you praise team
[17.58 --> 19.82]  and good morning Hope
[19.82 --> 24.04]  you guys here can say good morning
[24.04 --> 24.96]  good morning Hope
[24.96 --> 28.00]  I know we did a text greeting this morning
[28.00 --> 30.60]  but why don't we turn to the people around you
[30.60 --> 33.26]  and say the following words
[33.26 --> 35.16]  so may God's word
[35.16 --> 36.54]  so turn to the person next to you
[36.54 --> 37.26]  even at home
[37.26 --> 38.38]  if you're alone
[38.38 --> 40.20]  you can maybe text someone again
[40.20 --> 41.32]  and say
[41.32 --> 42.84]  may God's word
[42.84 --> 45.90]  bless you this morning
[45.90 --> 47.74]  amen
[47.74 --> 50.30]  it is my privilege again
[50.30 --> 51.90]  to share God's word
[51.90 --> 54.38]  and I sincerely hope that
[54.38 --> 56.80]  through the witness to God's word this morning
[56.80 --> 58.34]  you may be motivated
[58.34 --> 59.94]  now more than ever
[59.94 --> 62.34]  to enjoy true fellowship
[62.34 --> 64.94]  with your brothers and sisters in our community
[64.94 --> 67.88]  this may be part of your rule of life
[67.88 --> 68.92]  that we keep talking about
[68.92 --> 70.36]  which I will touch on more
[70.36 --> 73.86]  and so let me ask you a question
[73.86 --> 76.34]  when was the last time that you
[76.34 --> 77.54]  met with someone
[77.54 --> 79.14]  to share a meal
[79.14 --> 81.14]  well we're not allowed but
[81.14 --> 83.44]  share your faith journey
[83.44 --> 85.70]  and I'm hoping that
[85.70 --> 86.30]  some of you
[86.30 --> 87.84]  have had the opportunity
[87.84 --> 88.58]  to do so
[88.58 --> 89.32]  at least sharing
[89.32 --> 90.72]  the sharing part
[90.72 --> 91.50]  because
[91.50 --> 92.86]  I have seen
[92.86 --> 93.98]  plenty of people
[93.98 --> 95.84]  all around our province as well
[95.84 --> 96.90]  following
[96.90 --> 99.04]  following COVID protocol
[99.04 --> 100.68]  to catch up with their friends
[100.68 --> 103.04]  for me
[103.04 --> 103.68]  personally
[103.68 --> 105.28]  Fridays have been
[105.28 --> 106.40]  a blessing
[106.40 --> 107.92]  as I get to come into the church
[107.92 --> 109.02]  for office hours
[109.02 --> 112.40]  I come expecting to get all my school work done
[112.40 --> 117.22]  but usually end up working together with our staff
[117.22 --> 121.18]  getting caught up in conversations about church ministry and God
[121.18 --> 123.24]  and Misha is quite the talker
[123.24 --> 124.78]  I must say
[124.78 --> 127.50]  it's surprising how
[127.50 --> 129.62]  spiritually nourished though
[129.62 --> 130.82]  when I go home on Fridays
[130.82 --> 133.98]  and this is not just to mask it and make it look good
[133.98 --> 136.12]  I am truly spiritually nourished
[136.12 --> 136.94]  on Fridays
[136.94 --> 138.96]  and I hope that you guys
[138.96 --> 139.80]  you all
[139.80 --> 142.82]  can get a chance to create opportunities like this
[142.82 --> 145.72]  where you can catch up and enjoy true fellowship
[145.72 --> 147.04]  with one another
[147.04 --> 148.64]  with respect to the circumstances
[148.64 --> 150.08]  that are happening around us
[150.08 --> 153.28]  and so when you think about it
[153.28 --> 154.60]  isn't it ironic
[154.60 --> 156.68]  how this global pandemic
[156.68 --> 159.20]  has highlighted the importance of fellowship
[159.20 --> 161.86]  like enjoying human company
[161.86 --> 163.42]  simple as that
[163.42 --> 167.66]  I'm not even talking about just Christians
[167.66 --> 168.28]  obviously
[168.28 --> 170.84]  it's a natural human condition
[170.84 --> 174.08]  whether you're an extreme introvert
[174.08 --> 177.98]  an outgoing social creature like Dave
[177.98 --> 180.24]  or somewhere in between like me
[180.24 --> 182.58]  we all desire human fellowship
[182.58 --> 186.36]  and so to help us relate to this idea
[186.36 --> 189.12]  I had an image that I would like to share
[189.12 --> 192.40]  there's a reason why solitary confinement
[192.40 --> 193.72]  is a punishment
[193.72 --> 195.90]  this is in prison we're talking about
[195.90 --> 198.06]  when you think about it
[198.06 --> 200.98]  prisoners are already secluded from society
[200.98 --> 202.52]  for a crime that they committed
[202.52 --> 206.24]  but to restrict those social outcasts
[206.24 --> 208.82]  to further isolation from human contact
[208.82 --> 209.86]  is cruel
[209.86 --> 211.90]  and damages the human soul
[211.90 --> 214.34]  what's even scarier
[214.34 --> 215.34]  is that isolation
[215.34 --> 216.92]  can be felt by anyone
[216.92 --> 218.08]  not just in prison
[218.08 --> 219.68]  even with those of us
[219.68 --> 220.88]  who have big families at home
[220.88 --> 223.72]  and so when Moon and Joseph
[223.72 --> 224.52]  went to Korea
[224.52 --> 225.66]  about two years ago
[225.66 --> 227.34]  it was during the semester
[227.34 --> 228.04]  I couldn't go
[228.04 --> 229.46]  and Moon's grandmother
[229.46 --> 230.28]  had passed away
[230.28 --> 232.38]  back then we could travel
[232.38 --> 233.14]  so they went
[233.14 --> 235.42]  and I felt really empty
[235.42 --> 236.88]  and isolated in our house
[236.88 --> 239.20]  for some of you wondering
[239.20 --> 241.40]  I did feel that sense of freedom
[241.40 --> 243.60]  where I don't have any responsibilities
[243.60 --> 244.44]  I'm by myself
[244.44 --> 247.04]  enjoying the time alone at the beginning
[247.04 --> 249.50]  but I really truly dreaded
[249.50 --> 250.46]  going to bed at night
[250.46 --> 252.66]  going to bed alone at night
[252.66 --> 254.84]  walking past Joseph's empty room
[254.84 --> 257.36]  and I felt really really depressed
[257.36 --> 260.52]  you can make fun of me all you want
[260.52 --> 263.30]  but it was a really sad
[263.30 --> 265.52]  and depressing week of my life
[265.52 --> 266.58]  and that was just one week
[266.58 --> 269.28]  and so I have this painting
[269.28 --> 270.16]  that I want to show you
[270.16 --> 271.64]  that Dave shared with me
[271.64 --> 274.54]  you can probably see it on the screen
[274.54 --> 276.64]  Dave shared this painting
[276.64 --> 278.28]  with me that he had envisioned
[278.28 --> 279.90]  of using for a sermon
[279.90 --> 281.04]  on hospitality
[281.04 --> 283.68]  the painting shows
[283.68 --> 285.20]  how everyone is isolated
[285.20 --> 287.14]  and depressed
[287.14 --> 288.22]  in their respective homes
[288.22 --> 290.40]  I'm not an art person
[290.40 --> 291.72]  at all
[291.72 --> 293.68]  but from observing the details
[293.68 --> 295.34]  if you can't see it on the screen well
[295.34 --> 296.88]  it depicts the dark side
[296.88 --> 298.06]  of each isolated house
[298.06 --> 300.50]  I can definitely relate
[300.50 --> 302.36]  to more than one of those homes
[302.36 --> 303.36]  that you can see in the picture
[303.36 --> 305.34]  and I also hope
[305.34 --> 306.62]  that you catch the person
[306.62 --> 307.58]  on the far left
[307.58 --> 309.22]  interceding in prayer
[309.22 --> 312.60]  and what I'm trying to convey here
[312.60 --> 314.10]  in this long introduction
[314.10 --> 314.64]  this morning
[314.64 --> 317.08]  is that humans desire fellowship
[317.08 --> 319.86]  but the question I want us to ponder
[319.86 --> 321.98]  is what kind of fellowship
[321.98 --> 324.82]  is it simple enjoyment
[324.82 --> 326.84]  of being in the presence
[326.84 --> 327.52]  of other humans
[327.52 --> 330.52]  and so we keep talking about
[330.52 --> 331.76]  how COVID has kindled
[331.76 --> 333.06]  a desire for everyone
[333.06 --> 334.20]  and the world
[334.20 --> 335.30]  may envision
[335.30 --> 336.36]  some sort of fellowship
[336.36 --> 337.82]  that they think is right
[337.82 --> 339.82]  but I suggest
[339.82 --> 341.80]  that that envisioning
[341.80 --> 343.32]  that the world envisioning
[343.32 --> 344.08]  of fellowship
[344.08 --> 345.32]  is very limited
[345.32 --> 346.66]  and in the end
[346.66 --> 348.00]  it's only about
[348.00 --> 350.12]  self-desires
[350.12 --> 352.10]  and it's only self-centered
[352.10 --> 355.28]  and so the word of God
[355.28 --> 356.40]  this morning from Acts
[356.40 --> 357.28]  that we will look at
[357.28 --> 358.20]  gives us insight
[358.20 --> 359.08]  into what fellowship
[359.08 --> 360.28]  of believers is like
[360.28 --> 361.60]  what true fellowship
[361.60 --> 362.24]  is like
[362.24 --> 363.08]  you see
[363.08 --> 365.26]  all humans desire fellowship
[365.26 --> 366.28]  but the fellowship
[366.28 --> 366.98]  of believers
[366.98 --> 368.98]  as a distinct community
[368.98 --> 371.06]  is for the praise of God
[371.06 --> 372.76]  for the glory of God
[372.76 --> 374.84]  this is our identity
[374.84 --> 375.64]  and calling
[375.64 --> 377.64]  and so if you have
[377.64 --> 378.48]  your Bibles this morning
[378.48 --> 379.62]  please turn with me
[379.62 --> 380.94]  to Acts 2
[380.94 --> 383.54]  and we will start reading
[383.54 --> 384.72]  at verse 42
[384.72 --> 389.32]  that's Acts 2
[389.32 --> 391.18]  and we are starting to read
[391.18 --> 392.36]  from verse 42
[392.36 --> 396.30]  hear the word of the Lord
[396.30 --> 398.36]  they devoted themselves
[398.36 --> 399.84]  to the apostles teaching
[399.84 --> 400.98]  and to fellowship
[400.98 --> 401.98]  fellowship
[401.98 --> 403.94]  to the breaking of bread
[403.94 --> 404.82]  and to prayer
[404.82 --> 407.04]  everyone was filled
[407.04 --> 407.78]  with awe
[407.78 --> 409.02]  at the many wonders
[409.02 --> 409.58]  and signs
[409.58 --> 410.80]  performed by the apostles
[410.80 --> 412.80]  all the believers
[412.80 --> 414.28]  were together
[414.28 --> 415.34]  and had everything
[415.34 --> 415.88]  in common
[415.88 --> 417.62]  they sold property
[417.62 --> 418.18]  and possessions
[418.18 --> 419.06]  to give to anyone
[419.06 --> 419.76]  who had need
[419.76 --> 420.80]  every day
[420.80 --> 421.38]  they continued
[421.38 --> 422.10]  to meet together
[422.10 --> 422.98]  in the temple courts
[422.98 --> 424.54]  they broke bread
[424.54 --> 425.34]  in their homes
[425.34 --> 426.16]  and ate together
[426.16 --> 426.82]  with glad
[426.82 --> 427.94]  and sincere hearts
[427.94 --> 429.34]  praising God
[429.34 --> 430.22]  and enjoying
[430.22 --> 431.36]  the favor of all
[431.36 --> 431.96]  the people
[431.96 --> 433.10]  fellowship
[433.10 --> 434.46]  and the Lord
[434.46 --> 435.58]  added to their number
[435.58 --> 436.16]  daily
[436.16 --> 437.12]  those who were
[437.12 --> 438.54]  being saved
[438.54 --> 439.54]  amen
[439.54 --> 444.28]  and so in verse 42
[444.28 --> 445.14]  when we see
[445.14 --> 445.64]  they
[445.64 --> 447.04]  it starts with
[447.04 --> 448.54]  they devoted themselves
[448.54 --> 451.40]  we should make sure
[451.40 --> 451.82]  we know
[451.82 --> 452.50]  who we are talking
[452.50 --> 453.08]  about here
[453.08 --> 454.32]  brief background
[454.32 --> 455.44]  these verses
[455.44 --> 456.66]  are a continuation
[456.66 --> 457.62]  of the record
[457.62 --> 458.66]  of how the apostle
[458.66 --> 459.16]  Peter
[459.16 --> 460.10]  he was preaching
[460.10 --> 460.56]  a sermon
[460.56 --> 461.68]  he was preaching
[461.68 --> 462.78]  to fellow Israelites
[462.78 --> 463.86]  his own people
[463.86 --> 464.64]  to repent
[464.64 --> 465.40]  and be baptized
[465.40 --> 466.16]  in the name
[466.16 --> 467.10]  of the true Messiah
[467.10 --> 468.10]  which is Jesus
[468.10 --> 471.22]  I will be referencing
[471.22 --> 472.08]  Peter's sermon
[472.08 --> 472.90]  further along
[472.90 --> 474.00]  but keep in mind
[474.00 --> 474.94]  that our text today
[474.94 --> 475.62]  is addressing
[475.62 --> 476.84]  the new community
[476.84 --> 477.38]  of faith
[477.38 --> 479.72]  to be a little more
[479.72 --> 480.86]  nitpicky with details
[480.86 --> 482.16]  this community
[482.16 --> 482.72]  that we keep
[482.72 --> 483.38]  talking about
[483.38 --> 484.14]  we talk about
[484.14 --> 484.66]  all the time
[484.66 --> 485.18]  here at Hope
[485.18 --> 486.44]  is the faithful
[486.44 --> 486.90]  remnant
[486.90 --> 488.40]  of the old Israel
[488.40 --> 489.80]  the Old Testament
[489.80 --> 490.88]  people of God
[490.88 --> 492.60]  and at the same time
[492.60 --> 493.74]  it's like the new
[493.74 --> 494.62]  nucleus
[494.62 --> 495.94]  like a new center
[495.94 --> 498.02]  for the new Israel
[498.02 --> 499.78]  the Christian church
[499.78 --> 501.68]  and if all this
[501.68 --> 502.56]  sounds unfamiliar
[502.56 --> 503.14]  or new
[503.14 --> 504.24]  I encourage you
[504.24 --> 504.84]  to take our
[504.84 --> 505.64]  surge classes
[505.64 --> 507.30]  I've heard very good
[507.30 --> 508.04]  things about it
[508.04 --> 509.06]  and I hear you get
[509.06 --> 509.84]  like free lectures
[509.84 --> 510.56]  from professors
[510.56 --> 511.14]  or something
[511.14 --> 511.88]  I don't know
[511.88 --> 513.80]  I have to pay
[513.80 --> 514.56]  for my education
[514.56 --> 514.78]  but
[514.78 --> 516.08]  so
[516.08 --> 517.50]  refresh your mind
[517.50 --> 518.02]  to the questions
[518.02 --> 518.88]  that I asked earlier
[518.88 --> 520.04]  and this is the main
[520.04 --> 520.62]  point today
[520.62 --> 522.12]  all humans
[522.12 --> 523.02]  desire fellowship
[523.02 --> 524.64]  but what kind
[524.64 --> 525.20]  of fellowship
[525.20 --> 527.22]  what would you do
[527.22 --> 528.30]  what would you
[528.30 --> 528.98]  talk about
[528.98 --> 531.38]  so going back
[531.38 --> 532.04]  to our passage
[532.04 --> 532.80]  they
[532.80 --> 533.48]  so the new
[533.48 --> 534.32]  community of faith
[534.32 --> 535.08]  which is us
[535.08 --> 536.32]  devoted themselves
[536.32 --> 537.02]  to the apostles
[537.02 --> 537.52]  teaching
[537.52 --> 538.28]  and fellowship
[538.28 --> 539.50]  to the breaking
[539.50 --> 540.00]  of bread
[540.00 --> 540.82]  and prayer
[540.82 --> 542.62]  and I want to
[542.62 --> 543.50]  break each down
[543.50 --> 545.10]  first
[545.10 --> 546.00]  they devoted
[546.00 --> 546.48]  themselves
[546.48 --> 547.18]  to the apostles
[547.18 --> 548.00]  teaching
[548.00 --> 549.78]  what teaching
[549.78 --> 550.34]  is that
[550.34 --> 551.92]  did they
[551.92 --> 552.98]  teach math
[552.98 --> 554.54]  social studies
[554.54 --> 555.50]  music
[555.50 --> 557.48]  now I joke
[557.48 --> 557.84]  here
[557.84 --> 558.68]  while being
[558.68 --> 559.40]  a firm believer
[559.40 --> 560.14]  that all of
[560.14 --> 561.00]  creation witnesses
[561.00 --> 561.60]  to God
[561.60 --> 562.44]  even
[562.44 --> 563.36]  or actually
[563.36 --> 564.00]  especially
[564.00 --> 564.76]  science
[564.76 --> 566.38]  but here
[566.38 --> 567.00]  specifically
[567.00 --> 567.84]  we can see
[567.84 --> 568.54]  that the apostles
[568.54 --> 569.06]  teaching
[569.06 --> 569.84]  would have been
[569.84 --> 570.66]  about the gospel
[570.66 --> 572.00]  the work of God
[572.00 --> 572.62]  through Christ
[572.62 --> 574.32]  the apostles
[574.32 --> 574.92]  would have taught
[574.92 --> 575.38]  the gospel
[575.38 --> 576.20]  of God's kingdom
[576.20 --> 577.04]  just as Jesus
[577.04 --> 577.62]  taught it
[577.62 --> 579.30]  and so it is
[579.30 --> 580.08]  the same for us
[580.08 --> 580.64]  today
[580.64 --> 582.32]  it is part of
[582.32 --> 583.24]  our identity
[583.24 --> 584.74]  to enjoy fellowship
[584.74 --> 586.32]  by gathering around
[586.32 --> 587.22]  the word of God
[587.22 --> 588.18]  which we are doing
[588.18 --> 588.74]  right now
[588.74 --> 591.18]  and I understand
[591.18 --> 592.44]  at the present moment
[592.44 --> 593.52]  that it may have
[593.52 --> 594.28]  become a habit
[594.28 --> 595.38]  and that many
[595.38 --> 596.20]  may find it
[596.20 --> 596.90]  very comfortable
[596.90 --> 597.86]  to just turn on
[597.86 --> 598.78]  a YouTube stream
[598.78 --> 600.20]  to hear God's word
[600.20 --> 600.60]  preached
[600.60 --> 601.70]  and which I think
[601.70 --> 602.54]  is better than nothing
[602.54 --> 603.34]  in my opinion
[603.34 --> 605.56]  but we must get
[605.56 --> 606.62]  that fellowship
[606.62 --> 608.16]  true fellowship
[608.16 --> 609.02]  is not just getting
[609.02 --> 609.92]  a weekly dose
[609.92 --> 611.12]  of a Christian message
[611.12 --> 612.00]  as Val said
[612.00 --> 613.12]  not a download
[613.12 --> 615.24]  of Christian information
[615.24 --> 616.26]  to put in your brains
[616.26 --> 617.10]  I mean
[617.10 --> 617.84]  you can literally
[617.84 --> 618.72]  download this video
[618.72 --> 619.06]  right now
[619.06 --> 619.72]  after it's done
[619.72 --> 622.42]  but it's about
[622.42 --> 624.48]  true fellowship
[624.48 --> 626.64]  the full embodiment
[626.64 --> 628.22]  and enjoying
[628.22 --> 628.84]  the favor
[628.84 --> 629.72]  of God's people
[629.72 --> 630.36]  as it says
[630.36 --> 630.86]  in our scripture
[630.86 --> 631.42]  this morning
[631.42 --> 634.00]  and so secondly
[634.00 --> 634.86]  how else
[634.86 --> 635.88]  did they enjoy
[635.88 --> 636.82]  true fellowship
[636.82 --> 638.52]  it says
[638.52 --> 639.52]  by the breaking
[639.52 --> 640.02]  of bread
[640.02 --> 642.02]  now this could have
[642.02 --> 643.52]  signified regular meals
[643.52 --> 644.70]  that were enjoyed
[644.70 --> 645.54]  together by fellow
[645.54 --> 645.96]  Christians
[645.96 --> 646.88]  or it could
[646.88 --> 648.18]  signify that
[648.18 --> 649.00]  they were regularly
[649.00 --> 649.88]  regularly
[649.88 --> 651.56]  enjoying the celebration
[651.56 --> 652.36]  of Eucharist
[652.36 --> 653.30]  meaning communion
[653.30 --> 654.32]  which we did
[654.32 --> 654.92]  all throughout
[654.92 --> 655.96]  the Lent season
[655.96 --> 658.30]  it says
[658.30 --> 659.42]  that the early believers
[659.42 --> 660.06]  here in Acts
[660.06 --> 661.44]  met in personal homes
[661.44 --> 662.76]  and broke bread together
[662.76 --> 664.72]  and in my humble opinion
[664.72 --> 665.90]  there are many commentators
[665.90 --> 666.42]  that say
[666.42 --> 667.44]  no it has to be
[667.44 --> 668.04]  only communion
[668.04 --> 669.12]  or no it was just
[669.12 --> 669.82]  regular meals
[669.82 --> 670.90]  but I think
[670.90 --> 671.82]  it was just both
[671.82 --> 673.38]  both of which
[673.38 --> 673.96]  would have been
[673.96 --> 674.90]  with the purpose
[674.90 --> 675.50]  of fellowship
[675.50 --> 677.70]  and so
[677.70 --> 678.72]  in the early church
[678.72 --> 679.68]  they got together
[679.68 --> 680.46]  regularly
[680.46 --> 682.28]  and I want to emphasize
[682.28 --> 683.18]  regularly
[683.18 --> 685.30]  not just on Sundays
[685.30 --> 686.40]  whether it's COVID
[686.40 --> 686.98]  or not
[686.98 --> 688.16]  Sundays are not
[688.16 --> 689.00]  the only time
[689.00 --> 689.92]  for Christian fellowship
[689.92 --> 692.60]  they broke bread
[692.60 --> 693.50]  ate together
[693.50 --> 694.16]  with glad
[694.16 --> 695.26]  and sincere hearts
[695.26 --> 696.50]  and this was part
[696.50 --> 696.84]  again
[696.84 --> 697.92]  of their identity
[697.92 --> 699.70]  to have fellowship
[699.70 --> 701.46]  for God's glory
[701.46 --> 703.78]  and so
[703.78 --> 704.34]  in the early
[704.34 --> 706.46]  they still
[706.46 --> 708.50]  in the early church
[708.50 --> 710.04]  like us today
[710.04 --> 710.96]  devoted themselves
[710.96 --> 711.96]  to the breaking of bread
[711.96 --> 712.90]  meeting daily
[712.90 --> 713.74]  in the temple courts
[713.74 --> 714.96]  that was something
[714.96 --> 716.10]  common for the Jews
[716.10 --> 717.06]  at that time
[717.06 --> 719.10]  you could say
[719.10 --> 719.64]  that it was
[719.64 --> 720.88]  their rule of life
[720.88 --> 722.06]  that they lived out
[722.06 --> 722.56]  regularly
[722.56 --> 725.44]  but you have to wonder
[725.44 --> 727.02]  what would they have met
[727.02 --> 727.92]  and talked about
[727.92 --> 729.52]  getting practical
[729.52 --> 730.82]  getting into the details
[730.82 --> 731.66]  what would they have
[731.66 --> 732.84]  actually talked about
[732.84 --> 735.18]  I suggest that they
[735.18 --> 735.72]  would have
[735.72 --> 736.96]  talked about Christ
[736.96 --> 738.08]  his teachings
[738.08 --> 739.82]  heard and learned
[739.82 --> 740.72]  through the apostles
[740.72 --> 742.80]  witnessing to other Jews
[742.80 --> 743.74]  in the temple courts
[743.74 --> 745.42]  that there is
[745.42 --> 746.34]  a true Messiah
[746.34 --> 747.92]  again
[747.92 --> 749.04]  this itself
[749.04 --> 750.20]  is an act of worship
[750.20 --> 751.06]  in fellowship
[751.06 --> 754.48]  lastly
[754.48 --> 756.06]  scripture today says
[756.06 --> 756.92]  that they prayed
[756.92 --> 757.56]  together
[757.56 --> 760.38]  this could have been
[760.38 --> 761.32]  communal prayers
[761.32 --> 762.40]  during the celebration
[762.40 --> 763.00]  of communion
[763.00 --> 764.92]  or like traditional prayers
[764.92 --> 766.38]  in their Jewish customs
[766.38 --> 768.28]  again
[768.28 --> 769.36]  it was part of their
[769.36 --> 770.08]  daily rhythm
[770.08 --> 770.64]  to pray
[770.64 --> 772.72]  sharing prayers
[772.72 --> 774.12]  sharing the struggles
[774.12 --> 774.78]  in our journeys
[774.78 --> 775.34]  of faith
[775.34 --> 777.42]  whether we feel
[777.42 --> 778.44]  spiritually high
[778.44 --> 779.74]  or spiritually low
[779.74 --> 781.34]  when we get together
[781.34 --> 782.54]  what can we talk about
[782.54 --> 783.92]  what can we do
[783.92 --> 786.14]  one thing
[786.14 --> 787.34]  one important thing
[787.34 --> 788.62]  is that we can
[788.62 --> 789.60]  pray together
[789.60 --> 793.56]  there is significance
[793.56 --> 794.88]  in individual prayer
[794.88 --> 798.70]  we want to devote
[798.70 --> 799.46]  times
[799.46 --> 801.28]  part of our daily
[801.28 --> 802.96]  rule of life
[802.96 --> 804.20]  whether you know it
[804.20 --> 804.48]  or not
[804.48 --> 805.26]  everyone has
[805.26 --> 805.98]  a rule of life
[805.98 --> 806.82]  what we want to do
[806.82 --> 807.48]  is to be a little
[807.48 --> 808.20]  more intentional
[808.20 --> 809.18]  and acknowledge
[809.18 --> 809.68]  that we do
[809.68 --> 811.00]  and try to center it
[811.00 --> 811.88]  around God
[811.88 --> 814.26]  but there is
[814.26 --> 814.96]  power
[814.96 --> 815.80]  and a great
[815.80 --> 816.32]  blessing
[816.32 --> 817.42]  when we gather
[817.42 --> 818.04]  together
[818.04 --> 819.00]  as a community
[819.00 --> 819.68]  to pray
[819.68 --> 821.72]  and so it has
[821.72 --> 822.62]  been very encouraging
[822.62 --> 823.64]  to receive
[823.64 --> 824.54]  positive feedback
[824.54 --> 825.38]  about our
[825.38 --> 826.30]  dwell prayer nights
[826.30 --> 827.44]  which we want to
[827.44 --> 828.12]  continue to do
[828.12 --> 828.56]  obviously
[828.56 --> 829.88]  hopefully in person
[829.88 --> 833.32]  going back
[833.32 --> 833.96]  to our text
[833.96 --> 835.10]  let's go to
[835.10 --> 835.86]  verse 43
[835.86 --> 837.32]  and I'll read it again
[837.32 --> 840.22]  everyone was filled
[840.22 --> 840.80]  with awe
[840.80 --> 841.96]  at the many wonders
[841.96 --> 842.78]  and signs
[842.78 --> 844.46]  performed by the apostles
[844.46 --> 845.86]  performed
[845.86 --> 847.62]  I don't really like
[847.62 --> 848.20]  this word
[848.20 --> 849.14]  and this translation
[849.14 --> 850.34]  because it makes it
[850.34 --> 851.34]  seem like the apostles
[851.34 --> 852.40]  were putting on
[852.40 --> 852.88]  some sort of
[852.88 --> 853.88]  spectacular show
[853.88 --> 854.34]  you know
[854.34 --> 855.14]  dancing around
[855.14 --> 856.18]  making it look pretty
[856.18 --> 857.50]  so that all the members
[857.50 --> 858.02]  who were here
[858.02 --> 858.92]  all the newcomers
[858.92 --> 859.78]  would make sure
[859.78 --> 860.88]  they sign the membership
[860.88 --> 861.66]  cards or something
[861.66 --> 864.86]  the verb here in Greek
[864.86 --> 865.20]  is
[865.20 --> 868.64]  this simply means
[868.64 --> 869.32]  that the apostles
[869.32 --> 870.28]  made miracles
[870.28 --> 871.30]  and signs happen
[871.30 --> 872.96]  or just come into being
[872.96 --> 873.80]  it's not
[873.80 --> 875.18]  it doesn't have
[875.18 --> 875.64]  this nuance
[875.64 --> 876.54]  of performing
[876.54 --> 877.46]  putting on
[877.46 --> 878.46]  a spectacular show
[878.46 --> 880.34]  and also
[880.34 --> 881.04]  one does not
[881.04 --> 882.12]  even have to go far
[882.12 --> 882.90]  to give a little
[882.90 --> 883.76]  more context
[883.76 --> 885.30]  to what the
[885.30 --> 886.62]  wonders and signs
[886.62 --> 887.22]  may mean
[887.22 --> 888.98]  and so going
[888.98 --> 889.50]  a little bit
[889.50 --> 891.44]  forward
[891.44 --> 891.96]  no
[891.96 --> 892.56]  backward
[892.56 --> 893.90]  to the beginning
[893.90 --> 894.70]  of Acts 2
[894.70 --> 895.68]  remember
[895.68 --> 896.56]  this is Peter
[896.56 --> 897.14]  preaching
[897.14 --> 898.60]  Peter references
[898.60 --> 899.64]  the prophet Joel
[899.64 --> 900.76]  which records
[900.76 --> 901.62]  God saying
[901.62 --> 903.10]  I will show
[903.10 --> 903.72]  wonders
[903.72 --> 904.88]  and wonders
[904.88 --> 906.08]  in the heavens above
[906.08 --> 906.82]  and signs
[906.82 --> 907.48]  on the earth
[907.48 --> 908.00]  below
[908.00 --> 909.88]  and Peter
[909.88 --> 910.86]  gives an interpretation
[910.86 --> 911.44]  of this
[911.44 --> 912.38]  in verse 22
[912.38 --> 913.44]  so we're looking
[913.44 --> 914.66]  at Acts chapter 2
[914.66 --> 915.42]  same chapter
[915.42 --> 916.92]  and on verse 22
[916.92 --> 917.68]  he says
[917.68 --> 918.48]  Peter says
[918.48 --> 920.40]  fellow Israelites
[920.40 --> 922.26]  listen to this
[922.26 --> 924.26]  Jesus of Nazareth
[924.26 --> 925.26]  was a man
[925.26 --> 926.68]  accredited by God
[926.68 --> 927.62]  to you
[927.62 --> 929.34]  by miracles
[929.34 --> 930.36]  wonders
[930.36 --> 931.30]  and signs
[931.30 --> 932.32]  which God
[932.32 --> 933.18]  did among you
[933.18 --> 934.12]  through him
[934.12 --> 935.86]  as you yourselves
[935.86 --> 936.22]  know
[936.22 --> 939.42]  these wonders
[939.42 --> 940.20]  and signs
[940.20 --> 942.54]  they were pointing
[942.54 --> 943.10]  to Jesus
[943.10 --> 944.20]  and what God
[944.20 --> 945.02]  did through
[945.02 --> 945.60]  Jesus
[945.60 --> 947.64]  they were
[947.64 --> 948.84]  so the new believers
[948.84 --> 950.12]  and the community
[950.12 --> 950.68]  of believers
[950.68 --> 952.00]  were in awe
[952.00 --> 953.80]  of the gospel story
[953.80 --> 955.38]  something that
[955.38 --> 956.54]  they now
[956.54 --> 957.66]  identified with
[957.66 --> 960.80]  what Jesus did
[960.80 --> 961.44]  through his signs
[961.44 --> 961.96]  and wonders
[961.96 --> 964.42]  was giving us
[964.42 --> 965.04]  a foretaste
[965.04 --> 965.70]  of the kingdom
[965.70 --> 966.96]  where there are
[966.96 --> 967.98]  no more tears
[967.98 --> 968.50]  death
[968.50 --> 968.92]  mourning
[968.92 --> 969.56]  or pain
[969.56 --> 970.62]  and this was
[970.62 --> 972.72]  these were huge signs
[972.72 --> 973.94]  pointing to the
[973.94 --> 974.98]  inbreaking of God's
[974.98 --> 975.22]  kingdom
[975.22 --> 976.26]  here and now
[976.26 --> 978.08]  repent
[978.08 --> 978.86]  and believe
[978.86 --> 979.50]  the good news
[979.50 --> 980.10]  Jesus says
[980.10 --> 980.96]  for the kingdom
[980.96 --> 981.54]  of God
[981.54 --> 982.42]  has come near
[982.42 --> 983.84]  that's what the
[983.84 --> 984.82]  signs and wonders
[984.82 --> 985.54]  are about
[985.54 --> 987.96]  it is then
[987.96 --> 988.92]  so natural
[988.92 --> 990.50]  to see this verse
[990.50 --> 991.14]  about signs
[991.14 --> 991.62]  and wonders
[991.62 --> 993.36]  by verses 44
[993.36 --> 994.24]  and 45
[994.24 --> 995.10]  in our text today
[995.10 --> 997.30]  it's a famous
[997.30 --> 997.76]  you know
[997.76 --> 999.20]  image of everyone
[999.20 --> 1000.30]  giving up their property
[1000.30 --> 1002.02]  giving up on the idea
[1002.02 --> 1002.30]  of
[1002.30 --> 1003.08]  on the notion
[1003.08 --> 1004.74]  of owning private property
[1004.74 --> 1005.22]  itself
[1005.22 --> 1006.48]  all the believers
[1006.48 --> 1007.14]  were together
[1007.14 --> 1008.06]  and it seems
[1008.06 --> 1009.42]  that they had given up
[1009.42 --> 1009.90]  on this
[1009.90 --> 1011.56]  and they shared
[1011.56 --> 1012.86]  everything in common
[1012.86 --> 1014.20]  to give to those
[1014.20 --> 1015.88]  who ever had any need
[1015.88 --> 1018.28]  and so
[1018.28 --> 1019.38]  asking the question
[1019.38 --> 1020.74]  what brought about
[1020.74 --> 1021.42]  this idea
[1021.42 --> 1023.18]  who
[1023.18 --> 1024.20]  and what
[1024.20 --> 1025.24]  did they all
[1025.24 --> 1026.38]  identify with
[1026.38 --> 1027.80]  that they would all
[1027.80 --> 1028.90]  gather together
[1028.90 --> 1030.48]  to live in equality
[1030.48 --> 1031.36]  and unity
[1031.36 --> 1034.54]  and this question
[1034.54 --> 1035.06]  I understand
[1035.06 --> 1035.98]  is a leading question
[1035.98 --> 1036.96]  because I have the answer
[1036.96 --> 1037.48]  for it
[1037.48 --> 1039.34]  the what
[1039.34 --> 1040.14]  I suggest
[1040.14 --> 1041.10]  is that they were
[1041.10 --> 1041.82]  trying to reflect
[1041.82 --> 1042.72]  God's kingdom
[1042.72 --> 1043.92]  they were in awe
[1043.92 --> 1045.38]  of the inbreaking
[1045.38 --> 1046.32]  of God's kingdom
[1046.32 --> 1047.16]  and they were trying
[1047.16 --> 1048.14]  to reflect that
[1048.14 --> 1049.16]  here and now
[1049.16 --> 1052.32]  the who
[1052.32 --> 1053.76]  is that they all
[1053.76 --> 1054.96]  recognize themselves
[1054.96 --> 1055.94]  as united
[1055.94 --> 1057.52]  in Christ
[1057.52 --> 1060.54]  Paul expresses
[1060.54 --> 1061.56]  this idea
[1061.56 --> 1062.76]  clearly in Ephesians
[1062.76 --> 1063.48]  I can pull out
[1063.48 --> 1064.26]  different texts
[1064.26 --> 1065.62]  but this one
[1065.62 --> 1067.30]  expresses it really well
[1067.30 --> 1068.46]  Ephesians 4
[1068.46 --> 1070.48]  there is one body
[1070.48 --> 1071.94]  and one spirit
[1071.94 --> 1073.24]  just as you were
[1073.24 --> 1074.52]  called to one hope
[1074.52 --> 1075.38]  when you were called
[1075.38 --> 1076.80]  one Lord
[1076.80 --> 1077.94]  one faith
[1077.94 --> 1079.12]  one baptism
[1079.12 --> 1080.46]  one God
[1080.46 --> 1081.00]  the Father
[1081.00 --> 1081.76]  of all
[1081.76 --> 1083.12]  who is over all
[1083.12 --> 1084.08]  and through all
[1084.08 --> 1085.36]  and in all
[1085.36 --> 1089.14]  and so I think
[1089.14 --> 1090.00]  this can serve
[1090.00 --> 1090.80]  as a reminder
[1090.80 --> 1092.64]  that what we have
[1092.64 --> 1093.96]  and what we own
[1093.96 --> 1094.94]  what we own
[1094.94 --> 1096.88]  is not truly ours
[1096.88 --> 1099.76]  everything we have
[1099.76 --> 1100.84]  we owe to God
[1100.84 --> 1103.58]  and I truly believe
[1103.58 --> 1104.74]  that even the very
[1104.74 --> 1106.00]  breath that we breathe
[1106.00 --> 1106.92]  is a gift
[1106.92 --> 1109.52]  we are but dust
[1109.52 --> 1110.90]  without the breath
[1110.90 --> 1112.06]  of God living in us
[1112.06 --> 1114.86]  and so it's interesting
[1114.86 --> 1115.82]  in the Hebrew
[1115.82 --> 1116.72]  breath
[1116.72 --> 1117.58]  or wind
[1117.58 --> 1119.50]  can be associated
[1119.50 --> 1120.68]  with the spirit
[1120.68 --> 1121.42]  of God
[1121.42 --> 1122.72]  and so without
[1122.72 --> 1123.76]  the spirit of God
[1123.76 --> 1124.44]  living in us
[1124.44 --> 1125.82]  we are but dust
[1125.82 --> 1128.44]  and so the fellowship
[1128.44 --> 1129.32]  of the church
[1129.32 --> 1130.64]  gathers together
[1130.64 --> 1131.30]  to reflect
[1131.30 --> 1132.58]  God's kingdom
[1132.58 --> 1134.66]  and we do it
[1134.66 --> 1135.42]  one of those
[1135.42 --> 1136.50]  another way
[1136.50 --> 1137.08]  I should say
[1137.08 --> 1139.24]  is by taking care
[1139.24 --> 1139.68]  of those
[1139.68 --> 1140.40]  who are in need
[1140.40 --> 1143.60]  and so this serves
[1143.60 --> 1144.40]  as a reminder
[1144.40 --> 1145.52]  and encouragement
[1145.52 --> 1146.64]  of the projects
[1146.64 --> 1147.20]  that Hope
[1147.20 --> 1148.18]  has been a part of
[1148.18 --> 1149.96]  and continues to be a part of
[1149.96 --> 1150.60]  for our community
[1150.60 --> 1151.54]  here in Cloverdale
[1151.54 --> 1152.96]  and all across the world
[1152.96 --> 1156.14]  we may get caught up
[1156.14 --> 1157.12]  with busy Easter
[1157.12 --> 1157.94]  or wrestling
[1157.94 --> 1159.16]  to get in-person service
[1159.16 --> 1159.60]  back up
[1159.60 --> 1160.26]  which is natural
[1160.26 --> 1160.72]  right now
[1160.72 --> 1163.38]  but at that same time
[1163.38 --> 1164.38]  as we are busy
[1164.38 --> 1166.04]  with our services here
[1166.04 --> 1166.74]  preparing
[1166.74 --> 1168.74]  people who struggle
[1168.74 --> 1170.06]  continue to struggle
[1170.06 --> 1173.40]  in the broken world
[1173.40 --> 1174.36]  that we live in
[1174.36 --> 1175.54]  there is never
[1175.54 --> 1176.14]  a shortage
[1176.14 --> 1177.70]  of those
[1177.70 --> 1178.48]  who are in need
[1178.48 --> 1184.42]  and so as I slowly close
[1184.42 --> 1186.24]  I want to
[1186.24 --> 1187.66]  I want to invite you
[1187.66 --> 1188.70]  to think about
[1188.70 --> 1189.78]  what kind of community
[1189.78 --> 1191.12]  we want to be here
[1191.12 --> 1191.54]  at Hope
[1191.54 --> 1194.32]  what kind of fellowship
[1194.32 --> 1195.36]  do we want to enjoy
[1195.36 --> 1198.46]  how is our fellowship
[1198.46 --> 1199.32]  different
[1199.32 --> 1200.92]  from the mere desire
[1200.92 --> 1201.90]  for human contact
[1201.90 --> 1206.52]  in the concluding verses
[1206.52 --> 1207.44]  of our text today
[1207.44 --> 1208.00]  it says
[1208.00 --> 1210.08]  they gather together
[1210.08 --> 1211.38]  to praise God
[1211.38 --> 1212.86]  enjoying the favor
[1212.86 --> 1214.40]  of all the people
[1214.40 --> 1216.26]  as God adds
[1216.26 --> 1217.88]  those who are being saved
[1217.88 --> 1218.42]  daily
[1218.42 --> 1220.36]  and I'm paraphrasing
[1220.36 --> 1223.26]  and so to conclude
[1223.26 --> 1223.76]  this morning
[1223.76 --> 1224.60]  I want to reflect
[1224.60 --> 1225.66]  on the contrast
[1225.66 --> 1227.54]  between the world's fellowship
[1227.54 --> 1229.00]  against the fellowship
[1229.00 --> 1230.00]  of God's kingdom
[1230.00 --> 1230.80]  that we keep
[1230.80 --> 1232.46]  on reflecting on
[1232.46 --> 1235.80]  and this is a little bit
[1235.80 --> 1236.42]  more personal
[1236.42 --> 1238.40]  in the brokenness of sin
[1238.40 --> 1240.58]  the world we live in
[1240.58 --> 1241.20]  is divided
[1241.20 --> 1242.62]  no matter how hard
[1242.62 --> 1243.64]  we try to unite
[1243.64 --> 1245.62]  it will always be divided
[1245.62 --> 1248.42]  and being a little specific
[1248.42 --> 1249.24]  for my life
[1249.24 --> 1250.18]  growing up
[1250.18 --> 1251.44]  I can remember
[1251.44 --> 1252.18]  the cliques
[1252.18 --> 1253.34]  the peer groups
[1253.34 --> 1254.54]  in middle and high school
[1254.54 --> 1257.28]  I used to wander
[1257.28 --> 1258.16]  all over
[1258.16 --> 1258.52]  in my
[1258.52 --> 1260.00]  especially my high school years
[1260.00 --> 1261.66]  at every lunch break
[1261.66 --> 1263.14]  trying to look for
[1263.14 --> 1264.32]  my people
[1264.32 --> 1268.18]  I mean you can see
[1268.18 --> 1269.74]  high school wasn't very easy
[1269.74 --> 1270.80]  for an Asian kid like me
[1270.80 --> 1273.40]  and I found
[1273.40 --> 1274.50]  which is very ironic
[1274.50 --> 1276.36]  that the only cure for this
[1276.36 --> 1277.40]  was to find
[1277.40 --> 1278.32]  more Asians
[1278.32 --> 1280.42]  specifically Koreans
[1280.42 --> 1284.40]  and this ironically
[1284.40 --> 1285.46]  gave me a stronger
[1285.46 --> 1286.30]  sense of identity
[1286.30 --> 1286.80]  it did
[1286.80 --> 1288.02]  it gave me
[1288.02 --> 1288.78]  it healed me
[1288.78 --> 1289.68]  of a lot of scars
[1289.68 --> 1290.34]  that I've had
[1290.34 --> 1291.18]  but
[1291.18 --> 1292.38]  it caused
[1292.38 --> 1293.10]  more division
[1293.10 --> 1293.66]  in general
[1293.66 --> 1294.34]  for my life
[1294.34 --> 1297.88]  unfortunately
[1297.88 --> 1299.54]  this type of division
[1299.54 --> 1300.32]  this little
[1300.32 --> 1302.18]  specific example
[1302.18 --> 1302.72]  that I gave you
[1302.72 --> 1303.34]  from my life
[1303.34 --> 1304.96]  this kind of division
[1304.96 --> 1305.72]  doesn't end
[1305.72 --> 1306.50]  when we graduate
[1306.50 --> 1307.08]  high school
[1307.08 --> 1309.12]  it's reflected
[1309.12 --> 1309.94]  in all
[1309.94 --> 1311.02]  of our societies
[1311.02 --> 1314.26]  to get a little
[1314.26 --> 1315.00]  more serious
[1315.00 --> 1317.54]  thinking about
[1317.54 --> 1318.56]  police brutality
[1318.56 --> 1321.88]  the dramatic rise
[1321.88 --> 1322.96]  in Asian hate crimes
[1322.96 --> 1325.84]  see when our society
[1325.84 --> 1326.96]  faces difficulties
[1326.96 --> 1328.10]  and is challenged
[1328.10 --> 1330.44]  the natural desire
[1330.44 --> 1331.12]  for human
[1331.12 --> 1331.82]  contact
[1331.82 --> 1332.96]  and fellowship
[1332.96 --> 1334.78]  is very limited
[1334.78 --> 1337.20]  people look to judge
[1337.20 --> 1337.58]  others
[1337.58 --> 1338.76]  and only look
[1338.76 --> 1339.44]  out
[1339.44 --> 1340.18]  look out
[1340.18 --> 1341.32]  for their own
[1341.32 --> 1342.58]  however they define
[1342.58 --> 1343.70]  their own as
[1343.70 --> 1346.54]  and so in the end
[1346.54 --> 1347.58]  this natural human
[1347.58 --> 1348.54]  desire for fellowship
[1348.54 --> 1350.10]  is just for the amusement
[1350.10 --> 1351.12]  and satisfaction
[1351.12 --> 1352.26]  of our own
[1352.26 --> 1353.26]  selfish desires
[1353.26 --> 1355.82]  and the brokenness
[1355.82 --> 1356.60]  that's reflected
[1356.60 --> 1357.28]  out there
[1357.28 --> 1358.28]  in the world
[1358.28 --> 1359.30]  in our societies
[1359.30 --> 1360.46]  is as much
[1360.46 --> 1361.90]  reflected in our own
[1361.90 --> 1362.94]  in my own
[1362.94 --> 1364.34]  sinful dark self
[1364.34 --> 1367.96]  I also fail
[1367.96 --> 1368.92]  to love my neighbors
[1368.92 --> 1370.90]  I also fail
[1370.90 --> 1371.80]  to overcome
[1371.80 --> 1372.78]  division
[1372.78 --> 1374.26]  and racism
[1374.26 --> 1375.26]  in my heart
[1375.26 --> 1381.18]  the fellowship
[1381.18 --> 1381.84]  of believers
[1381.84 --> 1383.12]  is not a perfect one
[1383.12 --> 1386.50]  we are people
[1386.50 --> 1387.26]  who are called
[1387.26 --> 1387.84]  to enjoy
[1387.84 --> 1388.48]  the fellowship
[1388.48 --> 1389.92]  of saved
[1389.92 --> 1390.84]  sinners
[1390.84 --> 1392.42]  we don't stop
[1392.42 --> 1393.36]  at the saved part
[1393.36 --> 1394.48]  we thank God
[1394.48 --> 1395.44]  that he has saved us
[1395.44 --> 1396.10]  from what?
[1396.10 --> 1397.10]  from sin
[1397.10 --> 1398.76]  we are sinners
[1398.76 --> 1401.42]  beautiful mess
[1401.42 --> 1402.02]  remember
[1402.02 --> 1403.62]  is what the church is
[1403.62 --> 1406.40]  when we gather
[1406.40 --> 1407.24]  for God
[1407.24 --> 1408.20]  and not
[1408.20 --> 1409.44]  about ourselves
[1409.44 --> 1410.70]  we are humbled
[1410.70 --> 1413.06]  and our divisions
[1413.06 --> 1415.24]  be it racial
[1415.24 --> 1416.16]  cultural
[1416.16 --> 1417.16]  social
[1417.16 --> 1417.92]  financial
[1417.92 --> 1418.96]  personality
[1418.96 --> 1419.60]  age
[1419.60 --> 1420.02]  looks
[1420.02 --> 1420.92]  the way we dress
[1420.92 --> 1422.70]  it matters none
[1422.70 --> 1424.04]  when we come to worship
[1424.04 --> 1424.74]  the Savior
[1424.74 --> 1425.90]  who died
[1425.90 --> 1426.92]  and rose again
[1426.92 --> 1427.98]  to overcome
[1427.98 --> 1429.52]  the power of sin
[1429.52 --> 1434.60]  and so
[1434.60 --> 1435.72]  may we here
[1435.72 --> 1436.24]  at Hope
[1436.24 --> 1437.56]  be a fellowship
[1437.56 --> 1438.20]  that meets
[1438.20 --> 1438.88]  regularly
[1438.88 --> 1440.94]  to praise God
[1440.94 --> 1442.92]  not just
[1442.92 --> 1443.54]  on Sundays
[1443.54 --> 1446.44]  a kind
[1446.44 --> 1447.48]  that is in awe
[1447.48 --> 1448.70]  at the wonders
[1448.70 --> 1449.60]  and signs
[1449.60 --> 1450.68]  of God's kingdom
[1450.68 --> 1451.88]  a fellowship
[1451.88 --> 1453.02]  of breaking bread
[1453.02 --> 1454.04]  and praying together
[1454.04 --> 1455.30]  to praise God
[1455.30 --> 1455.84]  the Father
[1455.84 --> 1456.36]  and Jesus
[1456.36 --> 1457.22]  our Savior
[1457.22 --> 1458.34]  a community
[1458.34 --> 1458.90]  of fellowship
[1458.90 --> 1459.34]  who have
[1459.34 --> 1460.56]  everything in common
[1460.56 --> 1462.08]  and reflect God's kingdom
[1462.08 --> 1463.04]  for the marginalized
[1463.04 --> 1464.64]  because we identify
[1464.64 --> 1465.60]  with the Lord
[1465.60 --> 1466.64]  of all creation
[1466.64 --> 1470.26]  and may the Holy Spirit
[1470.26 --> 1472.28]  continue to guide us
[1472.28 --> 1473.46]  in our fellowship
[1473.46 --> 1474.64]  together here at Hope
[1474.64 --> 1476.24]  and that is my prayer

[1504.66 --> 1505.50]  for the world
[1505.50 --> 1506.82]  and for each other
[1506.82 --> 1510.02]  we thank you

[1515.48 --> 1517.12]  be able to practically
[1517.12 --> 1518.90]  enjoy the favor
[1518.90 --> 1519.88]  of all your people
[1519.88 --> 1523.68]  may we be in awe
[1523.68 --> 1524.64]  of what you have done
