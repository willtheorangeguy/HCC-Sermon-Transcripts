[0.00 → 29.98] Let's do it.
[30.00 → 59.98] Let's do it.
[60.00 → 89.98] Let's do it.
[90.00 → 92.00] Let's do it.
[92.00 → 94.00] Let's do it.
[94.00 → 96.00] Let's do it.
[96.96 → 111.08] We are also grateful, Lord, that you provide those who will open that word and have done the due diligence and the hard work of study and of opening hearts and opening minds so that that word penetrates.
[111.08 → 114.68] It doesn't become just an intellectual exercise, but it becomes a hard exercise.
[114.68 → 123.14] And so we pray that you bless Joan this morning as she unpacks your word for us, that our minds will be open, but so will our hearts.
[123.20 → 124.22] In Jesus' name, amen.
[124.22 → 124.32] Amen.
[124.32 → 124.96] Amen.
[124.96 → 125.00] Amen.
[125.00 → 126.00] Amen.
[126.00 → 127.00] Amen.
[127.00 → 128.00] Amen.
[128.00 → 129.00] Amen.
[129.00 → 130.00] Amen.
[130.00 → 131.00] Amen.
[131.00 → 132.00] Amen.
[132.00 → 133.00] Amen.
[133.00 → 134.00] Amen.
[134.00 → 135.00] Amen.
[135.00 → 139.00] Amen.
[139.00 → 140.00] Amen.
[140.00 → 148.30] said, can you preach on Exodus 25 to 31? And I said, absolutely. And then I said, what is that
[148.30 → 154.34] text? And he said, oh, well, you know, it's all the instructions for the building of the tabernacle.
[155.54 → 162.34] And I went, thanks, Dave. Thanks. What are we going to do with that? And it's a section of
[162.34 → 168.08] the Bible that would be very puzzling if you were the kind of person that played the, you know,
[168.08 → 174.86] random what's God's word for me today kind of game where you, you know, open your Bible and put
[174.86 → 180.84] your finger down. Because imagine you're doing that one morning, you say, God, what's your word
[180.84 → 186.62] for me today? And your finger goes down, and you get all the curtains are to be the same size.
[187.02 → 197.90] That's the next slide. 13 meters long and 1.8 meters wide. And you're like, okay, I'm redecorating now.
[197.90 → 203.74] You know, you, right? And so then you say, okay, that's wrong. We'll flip a page. We'll try that
[203.74 → 212.36] again. What's your word for me? Boom. Take from this ram the fat, the fat tail, the fat in around
[212.36 → 216.98] the inner parts, the covering of the liver, both kidneys and the fat on them and the right thigh.
[218.16 → 224.42] And you're like, what? I'm a butcher now? Or is this a recipe for goulash? Okay. Okay, God,
[224.42 → 232.52] we're on the wrong wavelength here. We'll try it once more. And then it says, make linen undergarments
[232.52 → 240.32] as a covering for the body, reaching from the waist to the thigh. And you're like, okay, what? Like,
[240.68 → 250.06] now God's talking to me about modest underwear? I mean, what is this? Context is important, isn't it?
[250.06 → 260.80] Context of one scripture, of a passage, of a story, of the whole narrative of the Bible is important
[260.80 → 268.18] to know. And that's why I'm glad we do so many series at Hope Church where we can follow things
[268.18 → 276.52] along. So here we are, Exodus 25 to 31, God's word to Moses and the people of Israel long ago.
[277.90 → 286.12] And we're going to read from Exodus 25 verses 1 through 22 to give you a sense of what's happening.
[286.26 → 296.46] It's the beginning of the scripture. Is there a verse 1? Okay. So this is God says to Moses,
[296.46 → 304.32] tell the people of Israel to bring me an offering. You must receive the offering for me from all whose
[304.32 → 311.02] hearts move them to give. Here are the offerings you must receive from them. Gold, silver, and bronze,
[311.22 → 319.18] blue, purple, and bright red yarn, and fine linen, goat hair, ramekins that are dyed the hides of sea
[319.18 → 326.42] cows, acacia wood, olive oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet
[326.42 → 333.40] smelling incense, onyx stones, and other jewels for the linen apron and chest cloth that the priest was
[333.40 → 341.86] going to wear. Have them make a sacred tent for me. I will live among them. Make the holy tent and
[341.86 → 349.84] everything that belongs to it. Make them exactly like the pattern I will show you. Have them make a
[349.84 → 357.46] chest out of acacia wood. Make it three feet nine inches long and two feet three inches wide and high.
[358.08 → 368.66] Cover it inside and outside with pure gold and put a strip of gold around it. Make four gold rings for it.
[368.82 → 375.72] Join them to the four bottom corners. Put two rings on one side, two rings on the other,
[375.72 → 382.24] and then make poles out of acacia wood. Cover them with gold. Put the poles through the rings on the
[382.24 → 389.16] sides of the chest to carry it. The poles must remain in the rings of the chest. Do not remove them.
[389.70 → 397.94] I will give you, God says to Moses, the tablets of the covenant, and when I do, put them into the chest.
[398.86 → 405.18] Make its cover out of pure gold. The cover is a place where sin must be paid for.
[405.18 → 412.74] Make it three feet nine inches long and two feet three inches wide. Make two cherubim, angels,
[413.24 → 420.12] out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover and put one cherub on one end of each of it.
[420.42 → 427.70] Make the cherubim as part of the cover itself. The cherubim must have their wings spread up over the
[427.70 → 435.00] cover. The cherubim must face each other and look toward the cover. Place the cover on top of the
[435.00 → 439.64] chest. I will give you the tablets of the chest. I will give you the tablets of the covenant. Put them
[439.64 → 449.56] into the chest. The chest is the ark where the tablets of the covenant are kept. I will meet with
[449.56 → 459.94] you above the cover between the two cherubim that are over the ark, and there I will give you all of my
[459.94 → 468.58] commands for the people of Israel. This is the word of the Lord. Now these verses are a snapshot
[468.58 → 478.18] of these six chapters, 25 to 31. God's word to people then, the purple, the onyx, the linen, the
[478.18 → 487.52] recipes for incense and underwear, and they're repeated almost word for word in Exodus 35 to 40 when the
[487.52 → 496.16] tabernacle is actually built. So a lot of the book of Exodus is taken up with these kinds of
[496.16 → 503.86] instructions. And, you know, I mean, did you feel your heart stirred as I read this? Like, maybe this was
[503.86 → 512.10] the word of God for people long ago, but how in the world does it mean anything to us today? Well, if we
[512.10 → 520.00] believe that all scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training
[520.00 → 527.98] in righteousness, then it's got to include this part as well. It must be the word for us too.
[529.50 → 535.76] So let's first understand how it was God's word in the original situation, and we've been doing that
[535.76 → 545.96] in this series where in some ways, oh, I shouldn't go off-screen, maybe. We start way back in creation,
[546.20 → 551.98] which is, you know, way over there somewhere, but I'll stay here. We start in creation with God made
[551.98 → 558.52] this excellent, wonderful, beautiful world, and everything was right. And then, of course, sin came
[558.52 → 565.72] into the world. And it's helpful to think of sin as a virus because we understand viruses a little
[565.72 → 574.10] better now, don't we? And this virus of sin, it affected everything. Nothing turns out anymore the
[574.10 → 581.96] perfect way that God intended it. So over the text, there is this big tension, this big question,
[581.96 → 590.36] how in the world can a holy God, and we sang about a holy God, maintain relationship with the sinful
[590.36 → 599.48] people and a broken world? How is that going to be possible? And in fact, you might think that God would
[599.48 → 605.62] just say, wow, that was a bad experiment, and scrape it off the Petra dish, and we're done with that. We better
[605.62 → 615.80] try something else now. But no, over and over again, Scripture shows that God cares. God loves enough.
[616.22 → 623.52] And in Exodus, we witness the amazing deliverance, where God hears the cries of God's people and
[623.52 → 631.10] intervenes. And then the people have been in the desert, in the wilderness, totally dependent on God
[631.10 → 636.44] for their provision. And it doesn't mean that they're only happy and thankful. There's been a lot of
[636.44 → 644.30] grumbling and complaining, but there's been a time of covenant. And in fact, right now, Moses is up on
[644.30 → 651.38] the mountain receiving instructions from God, which is part of God's rules for how this is going to work,
[651.50 → 659.62] a sinful people and a holy God. And now we're in the third part of it, which is dwelling. And this is the
[659.62 → 667.10] beginning of the third and last section of Exodus. It's going to finish it. And in between the
[667.10 → 673.84] explanations for the tabernacle and the carrying out of the building of the tabernacle are a couple of
[673.84 → 681.40] chapters that are really going to test God's patience and love. And I think Pastor Sid is dealing with
[681.40 → 688.78] those next week. So what's happening here? God is in the construction business. And God says that people
[688.78 → 694.64] need to build a structure, not just any structure, like go build me a structure, but a very specific
[694.64 → 703.06] structure. The instructions are clear. And God's instructions don't start with like, you know, the frame of
[703.06 → 711.60] the house, and then you fill it in. But instead, God starts in the heart of what this structure is. And what's in
[711.60 → 721.50] the heart? It's an ark or a chest or wooden box overlaid with gold. And into the box, the instructions
[721.50 → 729.30] at this time are to put the two tablets of the law. The very ones, by the way, that Moses is writing as
[729.30 → 736.14] instructions from God up on the mountain. And Pastor Dave preached on the Ten Commandments, that part of it.
[736.14 → 745.12] And Moses is to bring those stones down to the people and put them in the ark. In other words,
[745.58 → 755.94] in the heart of the whole structure, what is most precious is the word of God. God's word to God's people.
[756.88 → 766.12] Everything else in this tabernacle structure leads up to the word of God. And that is true.
[766.12 → 775.28] For us as well, isn't it? In fact, dwelling in this text for me in the last couple of weeks made me look
[775.28 → 785.92] at myself and wonder whether I or we honour that as we should. And then God commands a covering for the
[785.92 → 791.62] ark. And you see that on this picture already? To cherubim with wings that provide a covering.
[791.62 → 798.18] And they indicate the holiness of the situation. Remember, it's forbidden to make an image of God.
[798.86 → 807.08] And so cherubim are there probably to signify the heavenly places. And this is the intersection
[807.08 → 815.36] where heaven and earth meet. And God calls it the atonement cover. And atonement is such an important
[815.36 → 824.04] word in Exodus, Leviticus. It's where sins are paid for. And they are paid for with blood. The blood of
[824.04 → 833.64] some other creature pays for sin. This is also sometimes called the mercy seat and the very throne
[833.64 → 842.18] of God where God can sit on it with God's feet on the ark. The ark is God's footstool.
[842.18 → 850.10] And then God gives instructions for the tabernacle structure itself. And it's basically framing and
[850.10 → 857.14] layers of curtain. But it's also very beautiful. It's where the gold and the linen and the different
[857.14 → 865.12] coloured threads and images show up in this veil between the holy place and the holy of holies. It's
[865.12 → 872.10] divided into two places. And the beautiful curtain separates them.
[873.54 → 880.90] And inside the holy place, there's a table for bread. It has 12 loaves on it, representing the 12
[880.90 → 887.72] tribes. So they are always, in a sense, before God's face. There's also a golden lamp stand,
[887.72 → 895.40] the light of God in this place. And there is an altar in there as well. And this one's called the
[895.40 → 903.52] altar of incense, where incense was there burning always, always. It had to be tended to in the
[903.52 → 910.62] morning and at night. And as also once a year, Aaron the high priest would come and give a big
[910.62 → 918.90] offering, a sin offering on this altar, which was just before entering the holy of holies, where the
[918.90 → 925.26] ark was. And then there are directions for the courtyard. So this is what the whole thing looked
[925.26 → 931.88] like, kind of structure with cloths around it. And there were two pieces of furniture in there
[931.88 → 938.08] also. The altar of burnt offerings, that's the one where the people would come, give the priest their
[938.08 → 945.66] offering. So the bit I read about rams and fats and fat and all that would go on this offering to God
[945.66 → 953.28] as a sin offering. And the other piece was a basin for cleansing, where the priest would need to
[953.28 → 962.36] wash before they did anything. And here's a representative of the whole complex, just so you can get an idea.
[962.36 → 968.32] So what does this teach us about God?
[969.96 → 978.74] Well, God cares about some details, apparently. Sometimes we say the devil is in the details, but
[978.74 → 987.82] God is also in the details in a lot of these things here in the Old Testament. And that's true over and
[987.82 → 997.94] over again, where faithfulness to God is shown by carrying out his orders exactly. Over and over,
[997.94 → 1004.48] God says in this passage, do everything as I... It says over and over again, and they did it exactly
[1004.48 → 1014.64] as God had commanded Moses. Faithfulness shows up in obedience. And you see, as God is establishing
[1014.64 → 1022.06] this new or renewed relationship with the people, there's a sense in which they must understand
[1022.06 → 1030.64] that God needs to be taken seriously. Yes, God is coming close, and God cares for them, but
[1030.64 → 1038.92] there is a serious side to this as well. And, you know, it reminds me of when I was a high school
[1038.92 → 1043.90] teacher, and this will be happening again in a couple of weeks, although I'm not teaching
[1043.90 → 1048.22] high school anymore. But, you know, and then the students would come in, it'd be grade nine,
[1048.40 → 1055.16] you know, and you'd say, well, these are the classroom rules, and I expect this, and I expect
[1055.16 → 1060.36] that, and it will work best if we do this. And what's going to happen? Well, kids are going
[1060.36 → 1068.60] to test it, right? Especially in that first week or so, I needed to be sure that they knew I meant
[1068.60 → 1076.84] what I said. As I was forming this new learning community, they needed to know that I was serious
[1076.84 → 1084.56] about what I said. And it's something like that here with God. There's a new community being formed,
[1084.56 → 1092.72] and for this new community to work in a sinful world, there have to be some rules and parameters
[1092.72 → 1103.24] so it can go as well as it can. God might not be far away anymore, but neither can God be taken lightly.
[1104.90 → 1111.66] And, you know, I debated whether to stop there, but I remembered a New Testament story as well,
[1111.66 → 1121.18] where there's a new revival going on right after Pentecost, and people are coming to faith by the
[1121.18 → 1128.34] thousands, and people are being generous and sharing with one another. There's an apostle named Barnabas
[1128.34 → 1135.02] who sells a field and brings all the money to the feet of the disciples so they can share it with other
[1135.02 → 1143.26] people. And then there's another couple, Ananias and Sapphira. They're not to be outdone by Barnabas's
[1143.26 → 1151.26] generosity. Look how great everyone thinks he is. You know what? We can do that too. So they sell a property.
[1152.46 → 1159.82] But they knowingly hold back some of the funds. Were they allowed to? Of course, they were allowed to.
[1159.82 → 1166.78] But the fact is, they decided to lie about it. Even when Peter right out asked them, is this the whole
[1166.78 → 1174.54] amount? They said, yep, this is the whole amount. And God had to deal with them severely because there was
[1174.54 → 1183.30] a new work of God, a new spirit of God thing happening, and God needed to show that God was to be taken
[1183.30 → 1193.24] seriously. Another thing we see in this text is that when it comes to drawing close to God, approaching God,
[1193.86 → 1201.86] there is a kind of order to it. And as someone who has taught worship arts, I've thought about this
[1201.86 → 1210.98] a lot. What is the Old Testament image, and how does that relate to us? So in this tabernacle approach,
[1210.98 → 1219.18] things were very divided, right? Only priests could serve, and then only a few kinds of priests could go
[1219.18 → 1228.50] into the holy place, and only once a year could a high priest go into the holy of holies. So access to
[1228.50 → 1240.50] God is restricted. And approaching God had to be done with care. You had to make an offering, a sacrifice.
[1240.90 → 1247.64] You had to be sure that the incense was always going on in there, and that the light was always burning.
[1247.64 → 1255.52] And then you needed cleansing or forgiveness. You had to be washed clean. It wasn't just enough to say,
[1256.04 → 1262.10] I'm sorry, forgive me, but there also needed to be a cleansing act.
[1262.10 → 1270.80] And I wonder about us as we come together. As we're coming from our gathered worship,
[1270.96 → 1276.80] because that's worship too out there. Sorry, we're coming from our scattered worship to our
[1276.80 → 1288.12] gathered worship. And how do we approach that? I think, do we just kind of focus on worshipping God,
[1288.12 → 1295.66] giving God praise and glory, and it's all in this direction, which is important too? Or do we also
[1295.66 → 1304.80] hold the mirror up to ourselves and see the brokenness that we are a broken people in need
[1304.80 → 1316.96] of God as well? It's good for us to have a corporate reminder that we need God's cleansing and forgiveness
[1316.96 → 1326.64] as we gather. That we don't just waltz in on our own merit or worse, secretly think, you know,
[1327.00 → 1333.40] God got a pretty good deal when I signed up for his team. Hello? I mean, he hardly has to spend any
[1333.40 → 1338.34] grace on me, you know, like he has enough for all those other people that really need it.
[1340.14 → 1349.70] That's reason enough to repent and ask for cleansing. The words of Psalm 24 in word and song
[1349.70 → 1359.28] reminded us this morning of our need, and I found it very powerful. Who may ascend the mountain of the
[1359.28 → 1370.70] Lord? Who may stand in God's holy place? The one who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not trust in an
[1370.70 → 1382.96] idol or swear by a false god. Well, that's not me. It's not me on my own. I can't just waltz in there,
[1382.96 → 1391.94] only through the blood of Jesus. And what about that question, that tension hanging over the text? How
[1391.94 → 1399.20] in the world can a holy God maintain relationship with a sinful people and a broken world? How is that
[1399.20 → 1409.08] going to be possible? Well, God is instructing them in this text to build him a residence, a place
[1409.08 → 1417.38] where God says, I will dwell among them. I'm not simply going to lead you by a pillar of fire and a
[1417.38 → 1424.84] cloud. I'm not going to only meet with Moses and tell him outside the camp what needs to be done. Furthermore, I'm not
[1424.84 → 1430.98] going to be restricted to living on a mountain where, you know, thunder, lightning, and earthquakes makes
[1430.98 → 1443.58] you scared of me. No, no. I'm going to move in with you. And there are echoes in this story of that creation
[1443.58 → 1451.08] story where that was also God's desire to make a place where God and people could live together, except
[1451.08 → 1458.54] then it was without sin. And now God creates a place taking into account the realities of sin.
[1458.54 → 1466.88] creation. And there were seven days of creation and seven times God speaks to Moses in these chapters.
[1467.96 → 1476.32] And creation ends with Sabbath and these passages end with Sabbath of resting from our labour and rejoicing
[1476.32 → 1485.56] in God. And in both, God is a master builder. God imagines, I just love this, the beauty and the colour
[1485.56 → 1496.98] and the delight in both of them. And God lets it out and it gets made. Nothing is impossible with God in
[1496.98 → 1507.34] God's restoration plan. God is determined to live with people. And the beauty is that God moves right in
[1507.34 → 1518.12] the midst of this messy, haphazard camp. The whole camp is constructed now around the tabernacle. God moves
[1518.12 → 1527.70] right into the mess of everyday life. The screaming kids, the harried parents, the haggling merchants, the
[1527.70 → 1535.74] cooking fires, the bathroom breaks, the blood offerings, the noise and mess of goats and chickens and dogs.
[1535.74 → 1547.18] That's where God now lives. God stakes a solid claim in the broken world. Harking back to Eden and
[1547.18 → 1556.62] foreshadowing the restoration of all things, God will do this to reestablish relationship with God's people.
[1556.62 → 1565.96] And there's one more detail that I want you to see about this original. It's about on many of the items,
[1566.10 → 1572.16] for example, the ark. Remember, I was reading these details, and it had make rings and into these rings
[1572.16 → 1583.72] go poles. And these poles cannot ever be removed ever from the rings. And why is that? Because the word of
[1583.72 → 1598.04] God is not moving, God's presence is now movable. It's movable. God's people are on the move and God moves
[1598.04 → 1606.82] with them. God is always there in the middle of them. This is the God who moves anywhere, who goes along
[1606.82 → 1616.38] whenever, wherever. There is never a time or place where they or we are without the presence of God.
[1616.38 → 1622.54] Whatever the messy circumstances of our lives, our God is on the move.
[1624.26 → 1629.94] And you see, I hope, how this all carries over into the New Testament,
[1629.94 → 1638.88] into the life of Jesus, the ultimate sacrifice whose blood was shed. We refer to that this morning
[1638.88 → 1648.96] as well in song and text. And then remember that in the Ten Commandments and everywhere throughout the
[1648.96 → 1657.38] Old Testament, God's image is prohibited. You cannot make an image of me. And there's no image of God in
[1657.38 → 1665.78] the tabernacle. But in Jesus, we have the image of God as well. We know we have it in ourselves.
[1666.54 → 1674.20] But no one has ever seen God but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in the closest relationship
[1674.20 → 1684.70] with the Father, has made him known. And Jesus is God in the flesh, the incarnate one who moved in with
[1684.70 → 1693.86] us humans, who fulfills the tabernacle. John 1 verse 14 says, the word became flesh and made his dwelling
[1693.86 → 1705.70] among us. And that literally is the word tabernacle. So the word became flesh and tabernacle among us,
[1705.70 → 1713.38] moved right in, made his dwelling among us, the same as God in the tabernacle.
[1714.66 → 1722.30] And you know, I've always loved the drama of what happens when Jesus dies, what happens in the temple.
[1723.10 → 1726.84] And Mark says it this way, very simply. He says,
[1726.84 → 1747.04] From top to bottom? Who tore the temple veil? Well, obviously not by human hands. But it's God who did it.
[1747.04 → 1756.46] God said, we don't need this anymore. The holy of holies is accessible, is open. And Hebrews says,
[1756.90 → 1763.26] we have a new and living way opened for us through the curtain that is now the body of Jesus.
[1764.34 → 1772.10] Therefore, let us draw near to God with a sincere heart. And Joe picked up some of that this morning
[1772.10 → 1777.60] in his passage from Hebrews as well, which, you know, the Holy Spirit planned. We didn't.
[1780.56 → 1790.32] So, through the Son, and by the power and presence of the Holy Spirit, we have such a privilege of access
[1790.32 → 1799.32] to God. And the tabernacle is fulfilled in one other way, through you and me, through people
[1799.32 → 1807.96] who are grafted into God's family now, believers in Jesus. We are living, breathing, walking around on
[1807.96 → 1818.60] earth, tabernacles of God's Spirit. Whether it feels like it all the time or not. I'm saying that too
[1818.60 → 1826.60] this morning. Paul says, don't you know that you yourselves, and that is plural, by the way,
[1826.60 → 1835.72] are God's people, and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst. And Paul uses that as well to warn
[1835.72 → 1841.54] people and remind them, you now have this free access to God, and God lives in you, but that
[1841.54 → 1850.58] doesn't mean you should take God lightly. Following God's law is still important. Living God's way as a
[1850.58 → 1858.50] foretaste of the kingdom coming into earth, because you, then, walking around here on earth, are not just
[1858.50 → 1867.44] yourself, but you are a representative of something, or should we say someone, other than yourself.
[1869.50 → 1876.50] And do you know where this story is going? In the last book, the book of Revelation, and we had a series
[1876.50 → 1883.60] on that too, gives us another insight about the temple. You know, the apostle John sees an end-time
[1883.60 → 1889.38] vision in which the new heaven and the new earth are coming down, and then he sees Jerusalem coming
[1889.38 → 1895.44] down in it as well. And I don't know if you've been to Jerusalem, but you probably know enough about it
[1895.44 → 1901.96] to know that what's central or most important in Jerusalem is the temple. Even now, what's left of it.
[1901.96 → 1912.48] But you know what John sees? He says, I did not see a temple in the city. Why? Because the Lord God
[1912.48 → 1923.04] Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. We don't need a location anymore to try to get close to God,
[1923.16 → 1931.04] but God has moved into the neighbourhood, and at that time, God will dwell fully on earth and renew
[1931.04 → 1943.40] all creation. So people of God, we have a God who is holy, but who also loves, and who has a heart full
[1943.40 → 1955.26] of compassion. We have a God who makes a way for us to be reconnected with him. We have a God
[1955.26 → 1965.72] who cares enough to get down and dirty, to move right into the neighbourhood, our homes, our TV programs,
[1965.72 → 1973.66] our sports, our work life, our school, whatever it is. It is holy unto the Lord.
[1975.86 → 1982.90] And you know what? We have a God who's on the move, who goes with us, who does not abandon us,
[1982.90 → 1993.56] and who can redeem messes and create beautiful things out of chaos. And in this God, can you say
[1993.56 → 2003.20] these words with me? In this God, we live and move and have our being. And all God's people say,
[2003.20 → 2020.42] amen. Let me lead you in prayer. God, thank you for your word. Thank you that even when we approach
[2020.42 → 2026.66] it sometimes and don't know where it comes from or how to understand it or where it's going,
[2026.66 → 2035.90] that you do. And by your spirit, you can make it clear to us. We pray that something of your word
[2035.90 → 2043.48] will have landed in each of our hearts and that you will bring it to remembrance for us through this
[2043.48 → 2052.02] week or in the future, in whatever circumstance we find ourselves. Thank you, thank you, thank you,
[2052.02 → 2059.20] that you are the way maker, the miracle worker, the light in the darkness. That is who you are.
[2060.08 → 2069.48] And help us to carry and nurture the flame of the spirit, that we ourselves are your tabernacle
[2069.48 → 2079.62] wherever we may go. We bless you, Lord, for who you are, and we receive your blessing on our lives.
[2079.62 → 2086.66] In the name of Jesus and through the power of the Holy Spirit, we pray. And all God's people say,
[2087.40 → 2087.66] amen.
