[0.00 --> 1.70]  Good morning.
[5.48 --> 10.52]  First of all, I want to let you know that Dave Groon is just fine.
[11.74 --> 14.16]  If you're wondering, he's fine.
[15.02 --> 20.46]  It's the rest of us that are all taking care of the house, especially Brittany.
[20.86 --> 22.36]  They're the ones you have to pray for.
[23.26 --> 29.36]  Dave is doing just fine, and he's, on his last day, well, probably yesterday,
[30.00 --> 31.26]  of isolating.
[31.76 --> 35.98]  He's taking an extra day to be careful, I think, but Dave is just fine.
[37.60 --> 41.46]  Also, I wanted to let you know that, well, he actually asked me to let you know
[41.46 --> 45.52]  that this particular series that you've been having in Advent
[45.52 --> 50.96]  was the result of a discussion that Dave and I had, I guess, a while ago.
[50.96 --> 53.02]  I don't even remember it, I confess.
[53.36 --> 55.58]  I just see it, I saw it in the text of my phone.
[55.58 --> 60.52]  He reminded me of that, that it was the result of a discussion that we'd had
[60.52 --> 64.74]  about six months ago or a year ago when I suggested a good Advent theme
[64.74 --> 67.06]  might be to use the language of blessing.
[67.90 --> 73.92]  I have found that language increasingly helpful in understanding the entire
[73.92 --> 74.88]  biblical story.
[74.88 --> 81.60]  It's just a rich language that begins in Genesis 1 and ends in Revelation 22.
[82.60 --> 88.54]  And in many ways, it's part of the hope that we have for restored creation.
[88.86 --> 96.32]  So it's ironic that I get to complete this series because Dave is unable to do it.
[96.32 --> 102.68]  I'm going to be reading Ephesians 1 at the end, near the end.
[103.02 --> 109.18]  For those of you who are more, want to follow what I'm saying
[109.18 --> 114.12]  and have the background and see why I'm going to read Ephesians 1 at the end,
[114.34 --> 116.22]  you might want to have your Bible on your laps.
[117.20 --> 121.06]  And you can probably see where I'm going.
[122.28 --> 123.32]  Let's pray together.
[123.32 --> 129.44]  Father, we pray that as we listen to your word,
[130.40 --> 134.94]  that it would not simply be words directed to our ears
[134.94 --> 140.78]  or ideas directed to our minds and even our emotions,
[141.44 --> 149.00]  but rather that you, the living, risen, powerful, and loving Christ,
[149.00 --> 154.88]  might come to us clothed in these words of Scripture.
[155.96 --> 158.86]  Open our eyes to see you, Lord Jesus.
[159.68 --> 161.54]  Open our ears to hear you.
[162.36 --> 164.50]  Our arms to embrace you.
[165.36 --> 168.54]  And our will and our feet to follow you.
[169.28 --> 170.96]  We pray in Christ's name.
[172.82 --> 173.34]  Amen.
[173.34 --> 173.48]  Amen.
[173.48 --> 173.84]  Amen.
[173.84 --> 174.12]  Amen.
[174.12 --> 174.40]  Amen.
[177.40 --> 178.90]  This is going to date me,
[180.56 --> 186.22]  but I remember a song that came out in 1965,
[187.36 --> 189.84]  a song that has become very famous,
[190.16 --> 191.86]  that even if you're young,
[192.28 --> 194.32]  you probably know about this song.
[194.32 --> 204.20]  It was voted the 31st most important or greatest song of the 500 songs in this past year.
[205.08 --> 207.92]  It was a song sung by Mick Jagger,
[208.92 --> 212.32]  I can't get no satisfaction.
[213.30 --> 214.22]  Remember that song?
[214.74 --> 216.12]  I'd sing it for you,
[216.22 --> 217.68]  but then everybody would leave.
[217.68 --> 221.34]  I can't get no satisfaction,
[221.84 --> 223.42]  and I've tried,
[223.80 --> 224.84]  and I've tried,
[225.22 --> 226.46]  and I've tried,
[226.74 --> 227.82]  and I've tried,
[228.50 --> 232.10]  but I just can't get no satisfaction.
[233.24 --> 235.84]  Now we're going to ignore his bad grammar
[235.84 --> 238.22]  and the fact that he used a double negative here.
[239.72 --> 240.98]  We know what he's saying.
[241.20 --> 246.08]  I can't get that deep satisfaction I've been longing for.
[246.08 --> 248.20]  And he said one of the reasons,
[248.32 --> 251.44]  Mick Jagger said one of the reasons that song took off
[251.44 --> 256.36]  was because it was captured the spirit of the times.
[257.66 --> 265.02]  Indeed, it was a song about the inability to find satisfaction in a consumer society.
[265.74 --> 267.08]  In either consumer goods,
[267.78 --> 269.64]  as he speaks about advertising,
[270.08 --> 272.08]  or consumer experiences,
[272.92 --> 274.94]  as he speaks about sex.
[274.94 --> 277.86]  He's longing for deep satisfaction,
[278.28 --> 281.06]  and he just can't find it.
[282.06 --> 284.58]  This is the religious cry
[284.58 --> 287.92]  that comes from the heart of a people
[287.92 --> 291.68]  who long for deep satisfaction,
[292.58 --> 296.32]  for a rich abundance of life,
[296.98 --> 301.24]  who want to flourish and thrive.
[301.24 --> 304.72]  This is the way God made us.
[305.58 --> 311.70]  He made us to enjoy a deeply satisfying and abundant life.
[312.38 --> 315.88]  He made us to thrive and to flourish.
[316.58 --> 322.06]  He made us to delight in the richness of his creation.
[322.06 --> 326.76]  And so when we don't experience that,
[326.90 --> 328.94]  we begin to long for it.
[329.98 --> 332.18]  And a consumer culture says,
[332.90 --> 336.74]  the way to this life is through consumer goods
[336.74 --> 339.40]  and through consumer experiences.
[339.40 --> 343.42]  And we have just come through the season of Christmas,
[343.42 --> 345.52]  which is an orgy of consumption.
[346.52 --> 349.58]  And perhaps many have woke up this morning,
[350.24 --> 352.16]  and they have said,
[352.32 --> 354.62]  been satisfied, dissatisfied,
[354.78 --> 356.04]  the day after Christmas.
[356.32 --> 357.28]  And maybe they're saying,
[357.42 --> 360.14]  I just long for that satisfaction,
[360.14 --> 362.30]  and it just has not come.
[364.42 --> 367.14]  Jeremiah's words are appropriate here.
[368.12 --> 369.08]  He says to them,
[369.34 --> 370.32]  he says to Israel,
[370.78 --> 373.60]  you've exchanged your glorious gods
[373.60 --> 375.50]  for worthless idols.
[376.64 --> 378.04]  You've forsaken me,
[378.84 --> 380.72]  the spring of living water,
[381.06 --> 383.34]  and have dug your own cisterns,
[383.66 --> 387.74]  broken cisterns that cannot hold water.
[387.74 --> 389.12]  He says,
[389.48 --> 391.16]  can you imagine the silliness
[391.16 --> 393.34]  of someone in an agrarian society
[393.34 --> 395.96]  that has this spring of living water
[395.96 --> 398.64]  that constantly gives fresh water?
[398.98 --> 401.04]  And they ignore that fresh water,
[401.28 --> 402.92]  and they go and they build,
[403.14 --> 405.00]  and they dig a deep cistern
[405.00 --> 408.16]  that will catch the rain water.
[408.44 --> 410.20]  But the cistern is leaky,
[410.38 --> 411.06]  and it's dirty,
[411.12 --> 412.20]  and the water's dirty in there.
[412.32 --> 414.56]  And they keep going back there for water
[414.56 --> 416.86]  instead of going to this living water.
[417.74 --> 418.46]  And God says,
[418.54 --> 419.38]  that's what you're like.
[420.44 --> 422.88]  You've exchanged that living water,
[422.98 --> 423.92]  the glorious God,
[423.98 --> 425.66]  and you've looked for idols.
[426.16 --> 427.96]  You've looked for these worthless idols
[427.96 --> 430.40]  to find that source of life.
[430.60 --> 432.04]  And those worthless idols
[432.04 --> 433.62]  cannot satisfy.
[435.62 --> 437.06]  One biblical word
[437.06 --> 439.76]  that describes this human flourishing,
[439.92 --> 441.48]  this abundant life,
[441.48 --> 444.70]  this deeply satisfying and full life,
[445.12 --> 446.48]  is the word blessing.
[447.80 --> 450.24]  Now the word has been trivialized.
[450.80 --> 451.86]  The church I grew up in
[451.86 --> 453.98]  was almost emptied of its meaning
[453.98 --> 456.24]  by simply using bless
[456.24 --> 458.00]  whenever you didn't know what else to say.
[458.96 --> 460.30]  But it's a rich,
[461.18 --> 462.42]  biblical word
[462.42 --> 466.36]  to describe God's creational intention
[466.36 --> 468.42]  and design
[468.42 --> 471.04]  not only for human life,
[471.48 --> 472.84]  but for the entirety
[472.84 --> 474.62]  of the creation.
[476.40 --> 477.28]  Richard Bauckham
[477.28 --> 479.08]  is a New Testament scholar,
[479.48 --> 481.48]  and he's one of my favorite scholars.
[482.14 --> 484.56]  And he says this about blessing.
[484.56 --> 486.66]  Maybe we can get that quote on the screen.
[486.66 --> 490.96]  Blessing is God's provision
[490.96 --> 493.70]  for human flourishing.
[494.58 --> 498.22]  It is, in the most comprehensive sense,
[499.08 --> 502.04]  God's purpose for his creation.
[503.92 --> 506.26]  You see, blessing is God's generous
[506.26 --> 508.98]  and lavish giving
[508.98 --> 511.76]  of all good to humanity
[511.76 --> 512.94]  and to his creatures
[512.94 --> 515.58]  so that they might thrive and flourish,
[515.58 --> 517.20]  so they might delight
[517.20 --> 518.70]  in the fullness of life,
[519.04 --> 520.52]  so they might experience
[520.52 --> 522.14]  that deep satisfaction
[522.14 --> 524.12]  that Jager is longing for,
[524.46 --> 526.22]  and enjoy the abundance
[526.22 --> 527.98]  of good gifts
[527.98 --> 529.60]  that he's given in creation
[529.60 --> 530.56]  as a good father,
[530.94 --> 533.40]  and to then enjoy God himself.
[534.54 --> 536.96]  And it overflows in blessing
[536.96 --> 538.46]  and thanksgiving
[538.46 --> 539.90]  and praise to God,
[540.10 --> 541.88]  the only thing we can give God.
[542.44 --> 544.06]  But it also overflows
[544.06 --> 545.56]  as we begin to image
[545.56 --> 546.98]  and reflect God
[546.98 --> 549.48]  and begin to bless others
[549.48 --> 552.08]  in a sacrificial self-giving
[552.08 --> 554.08]  as we give ourselves away
[554.08 --> 556.36]  and forget ourselves
[556.36 --> 558.30]  and give ourselves to others.
[558.98 --> 560.14]  As Jesus said,
[560.22 --> 561.90]  and this is more profound than money,
[562.86 --> 565.08]  it's more blessed to give
[565.08 --> 566.94]  than to receive.
[566.94 --> 571.22]  blessing is given in creation
[571.22 --> 573.50]  and it is restored
[573.50 --> 575.14]  in the new creation.
[576.06 --> 578.48]  It's found in the first chapter
[578.48 --> 579.42]  of the Bible,
[579.82 --> 582.26]  in Genesis 1, 27 and 28.
[582.92 --> 584.66]  God created human beings
[584.66 --> 585.48]  in his own image,
[585.54 --> 586.70]  in the image of God.
[586.88 --> 587.92]  He created them,
[588.08 --> 589.04]  male and female,
[589.34 --> 590.46]  he created them,
[590.78 --> 593.24]  and God blessed them.
[593.24 --> 595.20]  But it's found not only
[595.20 --> 596.30]  in the first chapter,
[596.78 --> 598.04]  but in the last chapter
[598.04 --> 598.66]  of the Bible
[598.66 --> 600.16]  in Revelation 22
[600.16 --> 601.86]  where we're told
[601.86 --> 603.30]  as we near the end
[603.30 --> 603.98]  of the Bible,
[604.76 --> 605.82]  blessed are those
[605.82 --> 607.50]  who wash their robes
[607.50 --> 609.36]  that they may have
[609.36 --> 611.62]  the right to the tree of life
[611.62 --> 613.18]  and may go through
[613.18 --> 615.06]  the gates of the city.
[616.52 --> 617.74]  But this blessing
[617.74 --> 619.54]  given in creation
[619.54 --> 620.80]  was forfeited
[620.80 --> 622.22]  in human rebellion
[622.22 --> 624.86]  and replaced by a curse
[624.86 --> 626.64]  which is the opposite
[626.64 --> 627.40]  of blessing.
[628.40 --> 629.64]  It's the pain.
[630.44 --> 631.58]  It's the evil.
[632.64 --> 634.08]  It's the injustice.
[635.08 --> 637.94]  It's the perpetual frustration
[637.94 --> 640.02]  that we experience.
[640.74 --> 642.54]  That perpetual frustration
[642.54 --> 644.22]  that brings out
[644.22 --> 645.58]  the cry of Jager,
[645.74 --> 646.58]  the cry of the heart
[646.58 --> 647.40]  of Mick Jager.
[647.40 --> 650.38]  But the biblical story
[650.38 --> 652.24]  is a story
[652.24 --> 653.88]  about how God
[653.88 --> 655.46]  restores that
[655.46 --> 656.62]  creational blessing.
[657.50 --> 658.34]  And when we come
[658.34 --> 659.56]  to the end of that story,
[659.72 --> 660.96]  God has restored
[660.96 --> 661.66]  that blessing.
[662.92 --> 663.84]  And if we are to
[663.84 --> 665.66]  understand Paul
[665.66 --> 667.32]  in Ephesians 1,
[668.08 --> 670.30]  we need to understand
[670.30 --> 671.14]  that story
[671.14 --> 672.66]  because that's what's
[672.66 --> 674.66]  behind all of his words.
[675.04 --> 676.36]  This is the backdrop
[676.36 --> 678.12]  to all of these verses.
[678.84 --> 679.98]  Miss the story
[679.98 --> 681.58]  of God's restoration
[681.58 --> 682.48]  of blessing
[682.48 --> 683.74]  and we miss
[683.74 --> 685.06]  Ephesians 1
[685.06 --> 686.24]  that begins
[686.24 --> 687.34]  with this.
[687.92 --> 688.80]  Praise be
[688.80 --> 689.58]  to the God
[689.58 --> 690.24]  and Father
[690.24 --> 691.90]  of our Lord Jesus Christ
[691.90 --> 694.90]  who has blessed us.
[695.96 --> 698.30]  All those rich promises
[698.30 --> 699.56]  beginning with Abraham
[699.56 --> 700.76]  are now fulfilled
[700.76 --> 701.34]  in Christ.
[701.46 --> 702.78]  He says praise be
[702.78 --> 703.58]  to this God
[703.58 --> 704.22]  and Father
[704.22 --> 705.26]  of our Lord Jesus Christ
[705.26 --> 706.70]  who has blessed us
[706.70 --> 707.64]  finally.
[709.18 --> 709.56]  You see,
[709.72 --> 710.20]  Paul
[710.20 --> 712.62]  was a Jewish rabbi
[712.62 --> 713.92]  before his conversion
[713.92 --> 715.92]  and he assumed
[715.92 --> 718.00]  this Old Testament story.
[719.00 --> 720.22]  And just before
[720.22 --> 721.34]  the coming of Jesus,
[721.60 --> 722.50]  like all Jews,
[722.64 --> 723.46]  he was waiting
[723.46 --> 724.70]  for the ending,
[725.12 --> 726.00]  waiting to see
[726.00 --> 726.90]  how that blessing
[726.90 --> 727.86]  would come.
[727.86 --> 729.84]  And now,
[730.62 --> 731.52]  after conversion
[731.52 --> 732.12]  to Jesus,
[732.90 --> 734.36]  the end has arrived
[734.36 --> 735.16]  in Christ
[735.16 --> 737.30]  in the most shocking way.
[737.68 --> 739.00]  And he believes
[739.00 --> 740.30]  that this end
[740.30 --> 741.64]  has now come.
[742.90 --> 744.66]  So how does Paul
[744.66 --> 746.46]  understand the story
[746.46 --> 748.24]  that stands behind
[748.24 --> 749.12]  Ephesians 1?
[750.20 --> 751.80]  I want to capture this
[751.80 --> 752.62]  quite briefly,
[752.76 --> 753.14]  actually,
[753.74 --> 754.84]  in four stages.
[754.84 --> 757.28]  stage one.
[758.18 --> 758.86]  This is how,
[759.02 --> 759.20]  again,
[759.38 --> 760.94]  Paul and the rabbis
[760.94 --> 761.64]  and the Jews
[761.64 --> 762.38]  of that day
[762.38 --> 763.74]  would have understood
[763.74 --> 764.60]  the story.
[765.94 --> 767.20]  Beginning at the beginning,
[767.84 --> 769.22]  we see stage one,
[770.00 --> 770.80]  the promise
[770.80 --> 772.04]  of blessing.
[773.04 --> 774.26]  At the very beginning
[774.26 --> 775.44]  of Israel's history
[775.44 --> 777.04]  is found this promise
[777.04 --> 778.72]  that God makes
[778.72 --> 779.40]  to Abraham
[779.40 --> 780.14]  when he says,
[780.60 --> 781.46]  I'm going to make you
[781.46 --> 782.50]  a great nation
[782.50 --> 784.48]  and I will bless you.
[784.98 --> 786.16]  I will make your name
[786.16 --> 787.02]  great and you will
[787.02 --> 787.76]  be a blessing.
[788.58 --> 789.96]  I will bless those
[789.96 --> 790.70]  who bless you
[790.70 --> 791.76]  and whoever curses you
[791.76 --> 792.48]  will curse
[792.48 --> 794.00]  and all peoples
[794.00 --> 794.72]  on earth
[794.72 --> 796.28]  will be blessed
[796.28 --> 797.38]  through you.
[798.80 --> 799.36]  Here,
[799.58 --> 800.88]  in these few words,
[800.96 --> 802.24]  we find a blueprint
[802.24 --> 803.52]  for the way
[803.52 --> 804.24]  that God
[804.24 --> 805.12]  is going to restore
[805.12 --> 805.66]  blessing.
[806.32 --> 807.36]  He's going to restore
[807.36 --> 809.06]  blessing to one people
[809.06 --> 810.04]  and as he restores
[810.04 --> 810.86]  that blessing,
[810.86 --> 812.42]  he's going to put them
[812.42 --> 812.98]  in the midst
[812.98 --> 814.04]  of the other nations
[814.04 --> 816.44]  and all the other nations
[816.44 --> 817.64]  will be incorporated
[817.64 --> 818.84]  into that covenant,
[819.22 --> 820.32]  into that relationship
[820.32 --> 821.12]  with God
[821.12 --> 821.98]  and will begin
[821.98 --> 822.90]  to experience
[822.90 --> 823.72]  that blessing
[823.72 --> 824.54]  for themselves.
[825.82 --> 826.86]  God makes
[826.86 --> 827.64]  this people
[827.64 --> 828.28]  blessed
[828.28 --> 829.26]  to be a blessing.
[829.78 --> 830.46]  This is the way
[830.46 --> 831.04]  God
[831.04 --> 832.46]  is going to restore
[832.46 --> 832.96]  blessing.
[833.80 --> 834.78]  And this promise
[834.78 --> 835.34]  of Abraham
[835.34 --> 836.14]  looks back
[836.14 --> 837.26]  to Genesis 1
[837.26 --> 838.42]  restoring that
[838.42 --> 839.42]  creational blessing
[839.42 --> 841.02]  and looks forward
[841.02 --> 841.90]  to the end
[841.90 --> 842.46]  of history
[842.46 --> 843.38]  when God
[843.38 --> 844.22]  will restore
[844.22 --> 845.36]  that blessing.
[846.20 --> 847.20]  The promise
[847.20 --> 848.64]  of blessing.
[850.20 --> 851.66]  But how would God
[851.66 --> 852.78]  move this
[852.78 --> 854.70]  promise forward
[854.70 --> 856.30]  to the new creation
[856.30 --> 857.06]  and the restoration
[857.06 --> 857.84]  of blessing?
[858.66 --> 859.76]  He would do it
[859.76 --> 861.60]  by working in
[861.60 --> 863.20]  and through a people.
[864.04 --> 865.18]  And the Old Testament
[865.18 --> 866.64]  unfolds how God
[866.64 --> 867.88]  creates a people,
[867.88 --> 869.36]  a people that
[869.36 --> 870.92]  experience that blessing
[870.92 --> 871.80]  and are at the
[871.80 --> 872.96]  beginning point
[872.96 --> 873.78]  and the starting
[873.78 --> 875.28]  point of restoration.
[876.92 --> 877.74]  And we might
[877.74 --> 878.68]  tell the story
[878.68 --> 879.70]  the way the rabbis
[879.70 --> 880.10]  did,
[880.36 --> 881.06]  the way we see it
[881.06 --> 882.16]  in Ephesians 1
[882.16 --> 883.48]  when we see this.
[885.78 --> 886.34]  First,
[886.56 --> 887.72]  He chooses a people
[887.72 --> 889.44]  and that people
[889.44 --> 890.86]  are to be holy.
[891.64 --> 892.24]  They're given
[892.24 --> 893.10]  the law
[893.10 --> 893.98]  and the law
[893.98 --> 895.00]  shows them
[895.00 --> 896.36]  the way of life
[896.36 --> 897.64]  that will experience
[897.64 --> 898.28]  blessing
[898.28 --> 899.20]  in relationship
[899.20 --> 899.96]  to God,
[900.26 --> 900.88]  in relationship
[900.88 --> 901.72]  to one another
[901.72 --> 902.68]  and relationship
[902.68 --> 903.86]  to the non-human
[903.86 --> 904.54]  creation.
[905.54 --> 906.74]  They were chosen
[906.74 --> 908.36]  to be holy.
[909.52 --> 909.98]  Maybe you could
[909.98 --> 911.46]  put that next slide up.
[912.30 --> 913.14]  They were adopted
[913.14 --> 914.02]  as children
[914.02 --> 915.48]  into God's family
[915.48 --> 916.42]  to be able
[916.42 --> 917.38]  to live
[917.38 --> 918.48]  for His glory.
[918.90 --> 919.64]  They were made
[919.64 --> 920.58]  God's children
[920.58 --> 921.96]  and now their call
[921.96 --> 922.78]  was to live out
[922.78 --> 923.50]  the blessing
[923.50 --> 924.90]  for His glory.
[925.90 --> 926.76]  God then
[926.76 --> 927.72]  redeems them
[927.72 --> 928.70]  and liberates
[928.70 --> 930.14]  them from idolatry,
[930.72 --> 932.06]  freeing them
[932.06 --> 932.72]  so that they can
[932.72 --> 934.18]  live out that blessing
[934.18 --> 936.00]  and then He takes
[936.00 --> 936.82]  them to the land
[936.82 --> 937.70]  and gives them
[937.70 --> 938.60]  that inheritance
[938.60 --> 939.78]  to live out
[939.78 --> 940.70]  that blessing
[940.70 --> 942.06]  on the land.
[942.92 --> 943.78]  We hear
[943.78 --> 944.92]  all of these
[944.92 --> 945.52]  elements
[945.52 --> 947.28]  again and again
[947.28 --> 948.76]  in many places
[948.76 --> 949.68]  in the Old Testament
[949.68 --> 950.44]  as the story
[950.44 --> 951.04]  is told.
[951.04 --> 952.12]  But I've just taken
[952.12 --> 953.76]  one from Deuteronomy 4.
[954.44 --> 955.66]  Because He loved
[955.66 --> 956.52]  your ancestors
[956.52 --> 957.82]  and chose
[957.82 --> 958.72]  their descendants
[958.72 --> 959.50]  after them
[959.50 --> 960.66]  and He brought
[960.66 --> 961.56]  you out of Egypt
[961.56 --> 962.88]  by His presence
[962.88 --> 964.50]  and His great strength
[964.50 --> 965.82]  to drive out
[965.82 --> 966.54]  before you
[966.54 --> 967.58]  nations greater
[967.58 --> 968.24]  and stronger
[968.24 --> 968.78]  than you
[968.78 --> 969.94]  and to bring you
[969.94 --> 971.14]  into their land
[971.14 --> 972.08]  and to give it
[972.08 --> 972.74]  to you
[972.74 --> 973.82]  for your inheritance.
[975.02 --> 975.82]  Now keep
[975.82 --> 976.78]  His decrees
[976.78 --> 977.88]  and commands
[977.88 --> 978.98]  which I'm giving
[978.98 --> 979.70]  you today.
[979.70 --> 981.28]  live out that
[981.28 --> 982.92]  blessing on the land
[982.92 --> 984.90]  before the nations
[984.90 --> 985.80]  as the law
[985.80 --> 986.64]  lays it out.
[987.42 --> 988.30]  And so this is
[988.30 --> 989.24]  the way God
[989.24 --> 990.32]  is going to proceed
[990.32 --> 991.16]  and move
[991.16 --> 992.12]  towards blessing.
[992.72 --> 994.94]  He's chosen a people,
[995.10 --> 995.94]  adopted them,
[996.06 --> 997.18]  given them an inheritance
[997.18 --> 998.52]  and said now
[998.52 --> 1000.06]  live out that blessing
[1000.06 --> 1001.04]  before the nations
[1001.04 --> 1002.10]  so that they might
[1002.10 --> 1002.96]  see that
[1002.96 --> 1004.34]  and join you.
[1005.42 --> 1006.94]  The promise of blessing,
[1007.94 --> 1009.16]  the people of blessing,
[1009.16 --> 1010.44]  and finally
[1010.44 --> 1011.10]  we see
[1011.10 --> 1012.54]  a prophecy
[1012.54 --> 1013.18]  of blessing.
[1014.38 --> 1014.80]  You see,
[1014.90 --> 1016.50]  Israel fails
[1016.50 --> 1017.88]  to live out
[1017.88 --> 1018.54]  that blessing
[1018.54 --> 1019.98]  before the nations.
[1020.88 --> 1021.52]  They fall
[1021.52 --> 1022.20]  into the same
[1022.20 --> 1022.92]  curse
[1022.92 --> 1024.72]  and the same
[1024.72 --> 1025.74]  idolatry
[1025.74 --> 1026.96]  as all
[1026.96 --> 1027.50]  the other
[1027.50 --> 1028.40]  pagan nations
[1028.40 --> 1029.34]  around them.
[1030.34 --> 1031.18]  And so finally
[1031.18 --> 1032.30]  God has had
[1032.30 --> 1032.80]  enough
[1032.80 --> 1034.50]  and He punishes
[1034.50 --> 1034.86]  them
[1034.86 --> 1036.14]  and He sends
[1036.14 --> 1037.22]  them into exile
[1037.22 --> 1038.38]  and they lose
[1038.38 --> 1039.16]  their inheritance
[1039.16 --> 1041.18]  and they forfeit
[1041.18 --> 1042.88]  God's blessing
[1042.88 --> 1044.40]  the same way
[1044.40 --> 1045.48]  that Adam
[1045.48 --> 1046.12]  did.
[1047.30 --> 1048.78]  And now it seems
[1048.78 --> 1050.44]  as if God's
[1050.44 --> 1051.78]  plan to restore
[1051.78 --> 1052.34]  blessing
[1052.34 --> 1054.16]  is in jeopardy.
[1054.50 --> 1055.50]  The very people
[1055.50 --> 1056.06]  through whom
[1056.06 --> 1056.56]  He's going to bring
[1056.56 --> 1057.88]  blessing to the creation
[1057.88 --> 1058.96]  is now
[1058.96 --> 1059.98]  under the same
[1059.98 --> 1060.76]  curse
[1060.76 --> 1062.32]  as everyone else
[1062.32 --> 1063.64]  in exile.
[1064.28 --> 1065.14]  And so the question
[1065.14 --> 1066.02]  is how
[1066.02 --> 1067.56]  will God
[1067.56 --> 1068.62]  return this
[1068.62 --> 1069.32]  whole program?
[1069.54 --> 1070.08]  How will He get
[1070.08 --> 1071.12]  the train
[1071.12 --> 1072.10]  of blessing
[1072.10 --> 1073.18]  back onto the
[1073.18 --> 1073.68]  tracks?
[1073.92 --> 1074.76]  It's gone off
[1074.76 --> 1075.24]  the tracks.
[1075.34 --> 1076.20]  How will He get it
[1076.20 --> 1077.22]  back on the tracks
[1077.22 --> 1078.18]  and get things
[1078.18 --> 1078.92]  going again?
[1078.92 --> 1081.08]  And the prophets
[1081.08 --> 1082.12]  make a promise.
[1083.38 --> 1084.08]  What Israel
[1084.08 --> 1085.72]  desperately needs
[1085.72 --> 1087.16]  is to be
[1087.16 --> 1087.58]  forgiven
[1087.58 --> 1090.26]  and to experience
[1090.26 --> 1091.04]  a new
[1091.04 --> 1091.72]  exodus
[1091.72 --> 1092.82]  when that
[1092.82 --> 1093.78]  old exodus
[1093.78 --> 1094.58]  of liberating
[1094.58 --> 1095.18]  Israel from
[1095.18 --> 1095.94]  exile didn't
[1095.94 --> 1096.30]  work.
[1096.56 --> 1097.04]  A new
[1097.04 --> 1097.80]  exodus that
[1097.80 --> 1098.62]  will liberate
[1098.62 --> 1099.26]  them once
[1099.26 --> 1100.16]  and for all
[1100.16 --> 1100.72]  from the
[1100.72 --> 1101.66]  idolatry
[1101.66 --> 1102.66]  that has
[1102.66 --> 1103.30]  taken hold
[1103.30 --> 1103.60]  of their
[1103.60 --> 1103.98]  hearts.
[1104.22 --> 1104.72]  They need
[1104.72 --> 1105.28]  forgiveness.
[1105.90 --> 1106.56]  They need
[1106.56 --> 1106.98]  a new
[1106.98 --> 1107.36]  exodus.
[1107.52 --> 1107.82]  They need
[1107.82 --> 1108.52]  redemption.
[1108.92 --> 1109.86]  liberation
[1109.86 --> 1111.40]  from idolatry.
[1112.46 --> 1113.16]  Listen to
[1113.16 --> 1113.64]  Isaiah.
[1113.80 --> 1114.20]  One of the
[1114.20 --> 1115.08]  favorite texts
[1115.08 --> 1115.68]  of Israel
[1115.68 --> 1116.20]  was Isaiah
[1116.20 --> 1117.56]  40-55
[1117.56 --> 1118.70]  where he says
[1118.70 --> 1119.68]  now listen
[1119.68 --> 1120.24]  Jacob
[1120.24 --> 1121.66]  my servant
[1121.66 --> 1122.32]  Israel
[1122.32 --> 1123.00]  whom I have
[1123.00 --> 1123.44]  chosen
[1123.44 --> 1124.62]  this is what
[1124.62 --> 1125.10]  the Lord
[1125.10 --> 1125.72]  says
[1125.72 --> 1126.88]  I will pour
[1126.88 --> 1127.28]  out my
[1127.28 --> 1127.98]  spirit on
[1127.98 --> 1128.62]  your offspring
[1128.62 --> 1129.58]  and my
[1129.58 --> 1130.22]  blessing
[1130.22 --> 1131.48]  on your
[1131.48 --> 1131.94]  descendants.
[1132.94 --> 1133.26]  Remember
[1133.26 --> 1133.86]  these things
[1133.86 --> 1134.22]  Jacob
[1134.22 --> 1134.76]  for you
[1134.76 --> 1135.20]  Israel
[1135.20 --> 1135.86]  I will not
[1135.86 --> 1136.52]  forget you
[1136.52 --> 1137.86]  I have
[1137.86 --> 1138.62]  swept
[1138.62 --> 1139.76]  away
[1139.76 --> 1140.64]  your offenses
[1140.64 --> 1141.24]  like a
[1141.24 --> 1141.66]  cloud
[1141.66 --> 1142.90]  forgiveness
[1142.90 --> 1144.64]  your sins
[1144.64 --> 1145.22]  like the
[1145.22 --> 1146.06]  morning mist
[1146.06 --> 1147.80]  return to
[1147.80 --> 1148.20]  me
[1148.20 --> 1149.64]  for I
[1149.64 --> 1150.88]  have
[1150.88 --> 1151.20]  redeemed
[1151.20 --> 1151.46]  you.
[1152.56 --> 1153.38]  Israel is
[1153.38 --> 1153.72]  going to be
[1153.72 --> 1154.52]  forgiven
[1154.52 --> 1155.74]  Israel is
[1155.74 --> 1156.08]  going to be
[1156.08 --> 1156.86]  redeemed and
[1156.86 --> 1157.56]  liberated from
[1157.56 --> 1158.52]  their idolatry
[1158.52 --> 1159.98]  and then the
[1159.98 --> 1161.30]  nations are
[1161.30 --> 1161.78]  going to be
[1161.78 --> 1162.98]  incorporated into
[1162.98 --> 1163.72]  this blessing.
[1164.56 --> 1164.96]  Listen to
[1164.96 --> 1165.96]  Isaiah again
[1165.96 --> 1167.92]  in that day
[1167.92 --> 1169.20]  Israel will be
[1169.20 --> 1170.18]  a third along
[1170.18 --> 1170.78]  with Egypt
[1170.78 --> 1171.70]  and Assyria
[1171.70 --> 1172.60]  a blessing
[1172.60 --> 1173.44]  on the
[1173.44 --> 1173.82]  earth.
[1174.40 --> 1174.78]  The Lord
[1174.78 --> 1175.46]  Almighty will
[1175.46 --> 1176.16]  bless them
[1176.16 --> 1176.56]  saying
[1176.56 --> 1177.48]  blessed be
[1177.48 --> 1178.50]  Egypt my
[1178.50 --> 1179.04]  people
[1179.04 --> 1180.26]  Assyria my
[1180.26 --> 1180.88]  handiwork
[1180.88 --> 1182.06]  and Israel
[1182.06 --> 1183.66]  my inheritance.
[1185.48 --> 1185.84]  You see
[1185.84 --> 1186.38]  Paul
[1186.38 --> 1187.82]  like the rest
[1187.82 --> 1188.42]  of Israel
[1188.42 --> 1189.08]  and other
[1189.08 --> 1189.90]  rabbis were
[1189.90 --> 1190.58]  looking for
[1190.58 --> 1191.54]  this ending.
[1192.10 --> 1193.02]  How would it
[1193.02 --> 1193.88]  take place?
[1194.30 --> 1194.86]  How would
[1194.86 --> 1195.66]  Israel be
[1195.66 --> 1196.12]  forgiven?
[1196.52 --> 1197.04]  How would
[1197.04 --> 1197.66]  Israel be
[1197.66 --> 1198.54]  liberated and
[1198.54 --> 1199.02]  redeemed?
[1199.24 --> 1199.90]  How would the
[1199.90 --> 1200.62]  nations be
[1200.62 --> 1201.90]  incorporated into
[1201.90 --> 1202.08]  it?
[1202.40 --> 1203.20]  Everyone in
[1203.20 --> 1203.92]  Israel is
[1203.92 --> 1204.52]  looking for
[1204.52 --> 1205.02]  the ending
[1205.02 --> 1205.84]  of the story.
[1207.08 --> 1208.06]  But then
[1208.06 --> 1208.96]  for Paul
[1208.96 --> 1210.42]  it happens
[1210.42 --> 1211.64]  in the most
[1211.64 --> 1212.88]  unexpected
[1212.88 --> 1214.76]  and shocking
[1214.76 --> 1215.56]  way.
[1216.88 --> 1217.84]  I want you
[1217.84 --> 1218.88]  to get hold
[1218.88 --> 1219.36]  of this
[1219.36 --> 1220.80]  because we
[1220.80 --> 1221.56]  have heard
[1221.56 --> 1222.60]  for so many
[1222.60 --> 1223.56]  every Sunday
[1223.56 --> 1224.44]  we hear how
[1224.44 --> 1226.04]  Jesus fulfills
[1226.04 --> 1226.88]  that story
[1226.88 --> 1227.74]  and it is so
[1227.74 --> 1228.24]  true.
[1228.86 --> 1229.88]  But we forget
[1229.88 --> 1230.96]  how shocking
[1230.96 --> 1231.92]  this fulfillment
[1231.92 --> 1232.48]  was.
[1232.68 --> 1233.84]  How astonishing
[1233.84 --> 1234.94]  and astounding
[1234.94 --> 1235.66]  this fulfillment
[1235.66 --> 1236.22]  was.
[1236.68 --> 1237.26]  Why it was a
[1237.26 --> 1238.30]  stumbling block
[1238.30 --> 1238.98]  for Jews.
[1239.42 --> 1239.90]  Why it was
[1239.90 --> 1241.88]  absolute stupidity
[1241.88 --> 1242.68]  for the Greeks
[1242.68 --> 1243.92]  and the Gentiles.
[1244.12 --> 1245.00]  It didn't make
[1245.00 --> 1245.76]  any sense.
[1246.18 --> 1247.34]  But for Paul
[1247.34 --> 1249.02]  this blessing
[1249.02 --> 1250.64]  finally comes
[1250.64 --> 1251.86]  through the
[1251.86 --> 1253.36]  humiliating death
[1253.36 --> 1254.36]  of Jesus Christ
[1254.36 --> 1255.18]  on the cross
[1255.18 --> 1256.16]  and his
[1256.16 --> 1256.70]  resurrection.
[1258.20 --> 1258.60]  And so in
[1258.60 --> 1259.60]  stage four
[1259.60 --> 1260.46]  for Paul
[1260.46 --> 1261.60]  blessing
[1261.60 --> 1263.82]  finally comes
[1263.82 --> 1265.44]  in Christ.
[1266.38 --> 1267.20]  It comes
[1267.20 --> 1268.02]  as Christ
[1268.02 --> 1269.00]  takes the
[1269.00 --> 1269.66]  curse
[1269.66 --> 1270.60]  of sin
[1270.60 --> 1271.14]  that has
[1271.14 --> 1272.00]  ruined human
[1272.00 --> 1272.94]  life on
[1272.94 --> 1273.82]  himself at
[1273.82 --> 1274.52]  the cross.
[1275.12 --> 1276.06]  It comes
[1276.06 --> 1277.08]  as he inaugurates
[1277.08 --> 1278.12]  the new life
[1278.12 --> 1279.00]  of blessing
[1279.00 --> 1280.16]  in his resurrection
[1280.16 --> 1281.26]  as he rises
[1281.26 --> 1282.08]  from the dead.
[1282.92 --> 1284.12]  It's in Christ
[1284.12 --> 1284.56]  that this
[1284.56 --> 1285.24]  blessing
[1285.24 --> 1286.12]  is finally
[1286.12 --> 1287.24]  can come
[1287.24 --> 1288.06]  to Israel
[1288.06 --> 1288.86]  and to all
[1288.86 --> 1289.48]  nations.
[1290.44 --> 1290.96]  Galatians
[1290.96 --> 1291.70]  says this.
[1292.28 --> 1292.64]  This is
[1292.64 --> 1293.60]  surprising.
[1294.62 --> 1294.98]  Scripture
[1294.98 --> 1295.92]  foresaw that
[1295.92 --> 1296.52]  God would
[1296.52 --> 1297.56]  justify the
[1297.56 --> 1298.30]  Gentiles by
[1298.30 --> 1298.84]  faith and
[1298.84 --> 1299.46]  announced
[1299.46 --> 1300.12]  what?
[1301.24 --> 1302.54]  The gospel
[1302.54 --> 1304.56]  and advanced
[1304.56 --> 1305.18]  Abraham.
[1305.74 --> 1306.50]  Way back
[1306.50 --> 1307.02]  in Genesis
[1307.02 --> 1307.58]  12 he
[1307.58 --> 1308.14]  announces
[1308.14 --> 1308.80]  the good
[1308.80 --> 1309.36]  news.
[1309.66 --> 1309.86]  And the
[1309.86 --> 1310.70]  good news
[1310.70 --> 1312.12]  is all
[1312.12 --> 1313.16]  nations
[1313.16 --> 1314.58]  will be
[1314.58 --> 1315.26]  blessed
[1315.26 --> 1317.02]  through you.
[1318.24 --> 1318.98]  You see
[1318.98 --> 1320.84]  in Ephesians
[1320.84 --> 1322.44]  Paul has
[1322.44 --> 1323.36]  everything I've
[1323.36 --> 1324.30]  just summarized
[1324.30 --> 1324.94]  for you in
[1324.94 --> 1325.58]  ten minutes
[1325.58 --> 1326.78]  in the back
[1326.78 --> 1327.32]  of his head.
[1327.94 --> 1328.82]  And now
[1328.82 --> 1329.78]  as he opens
[1329.78 --> 1330.40]  his mouth
[1330.40 --> 1330.90]  he says
[1330.90 --> 1332.46]  praise be
[1332.46 --> 1333.18]  to the
[1333.18 --> 1334.02]  God and
[1334.02 --> 1335.00]  Father of
[1335.00 --> 1335.54]  our Lord
[1335.54 --> 1336.60]  Jesus Christ
[1336.60 --> 1337.30]  who has
[1337.30 --> 1338.68]  blessed us
[1338.68 --> 1339.60]  in the heavenly
[1339.60 --> 1340.74]  realms with
[1340.74 --> 1341.54]  every spiritual
[1341.54 --> 1342.28]  blessing in
[1342.28 --> 1342.68]  Christ.
[1343.02 --> 1343.64]  Now by the
[1343.64 --> 1344.56]  Spirit that
[1344.56 --> 1345.34]  blessing has
[1345.34 --> 1346.10]  come.
[1346.82 --> 1347.38]  And in
[1347.38 --> 1348.78]  Christ we
[1348.78 --> 1349.50]  now can
[1349.50 --> 1350.88]  finally experience
[1350.88 --> 1351.46]  what we have
[1351.46 --> 1352.02]  been made
[1352.02 --> 1353.00]  for as
[1353.00 --> 1353.74]  truly being
[1353.74 --> 1354.60]  truly human
[1354.60 --> 1355.68]  and experience
[1355.68 --> 1356.72]  the blessing
[1356.72 --> 1357.74]  as he has
[1357.74 --> 1358.28]  promised.
[1359.32 --> 1360.02]  And now
[1360.02 --> 1360.82]  as he moves
[1360.82 --> 1361.16]  through the
[1361.16 --> 1361.80]  verses I'm
[1361.80 --> 1362.82]  going to begin
[1362.82 --> 1363.34]  reading at
[1363.34 --> 1364.04]  verse 4.
[1364.66 --> 1365.26]  Listen to
[1365.26 --> 1365.64]  what he's
[1365.64 --> 1366.04]  saying.
[1366.80 --> 1367.26]  He's saying
[1367.26 --> 1368.26]  this long
[1368.26 --> 1369.38]  story that
[1369.38 --> 1370.04]  God is
[1370.04 --> 1370.52]  restoring
[1370.52 --> 1371.58]  blessing has
[1371.58 --> 1371.96]  now been
[1371.96 --> 1373.16]  fulfilled and
[1373.16 --> 1373.78]  given to
[1373.78 --> 1374.40]  Israel in
[1374.40 --> 1375.00]  Christ.
[1375.92 --> 1376.18]  For he
[1376.18 --> 1377.12]  chose us
[1377.12 --> 1377.68]  in him
[1377.68 --> 1378.70]  before the
[1378.70 --> 1379.38]  creation of
[1379.38 --> 1379.72]  the world
[1379.72 --> 1380.44]  to be holy
[1380.44 --> 1381.38]  and blameless
[1381.38 --> 1382.24]  in his
[1382.24 --> 1382.60]  sight.
[1383.00 --> 1383.76]  Now Israel
[1383.76 --> 1384.54]  can be that
[1384.54 --> 1385.62]  chosen and
[1385.62 --> 1386.60]  holy people
[1386.60 --> 1387.20]  they were
[1387.20 --> 1388.28]  intended to
[1388.28 --> 1388.60]  be.
[1389.50 --> 1390.08]  In love
[1390.08 --> 1390.88]  he predestined
[1390.88 --> 1391.46]  us to be
[1391.46 --> 1391.98]  adoption
[1391.98 --> 1393.58]  to sonship
[1393.58 --> 1394.40]  through Jesus
[1394.40 --> 1395.18]  Christ in
[1395.18 --> 1396.00]  accordance with
[1396.00 --> 1396.58]  the pleasure
[1396.58 --> 1397.56]  and will
[1397.56 --> 1398.24]  to the
[1398.24 --> 1399.34]  praise of
[1399.34 --> 1399.96]  his glorious
[1399.96 --> 1401.00]  grace which
[1401.00 --> 1401.60]  he has freely
[1401.60 --> 1402.38]  given us
[1402.38 --> 1403.42]  in the one
[1403.42 --> 1404.24]  he loves.
[1404.70 --> 1405.48]  Now Israel
[1405.48 --> 1406.34]  can experience
[1406.34 --> 1407.46]  that adoption
[1407.46 --> 1408.50]  as God's
[1408.50 --> 1409.50]  children and
[1409.50 --> 1410.44]  now live
[1410.44 --> 1411.52]  for the glory
[1411.52 --> 1412.54]  of his grace.
[1413.54 --> 1413.92]  And not
[1413.92 --> 1414.62]  only that
[1414.62 --> 1415.86]  in him we
[1415.86 --> 1416.64]  have redemption
[1416.64 --> 1417.32]  through his
[1417.32 --> 1417.78]  blood.
[1418.18 --> 1418.96]  The forgiveness
[1418.96 --> 1419.92]  of sins
[1419.92 --> 1420.94]  in accordance
[1420.94 --> 1421.38]  with the
[1421.38 --> 1421.90]  riches of
[1421.90 --> 1422.78]  God's grace
[1422.78 --> 1423.50]  that he has
[1423.50 --> 1424.28]  lavished on
[1424.28 --> 1425.32]  us with all
[1425.32 --> 1426.42]  wisdom and
[1426.42 --> 1427.16]  understanding.
[1427.84 --> 1428.64]  Now Israel
[1428.64 --> 1429.64]  is forgiven
[1429.64 --> 1430.14]  for their
[1430.14 --> 1430.62]  rebellion
[1430.62 --> 1432.00]  and now they
[1432.00 --> 1432.84]  can experience
[1432.84 --> 1433.32]  that new
[1433.32 --> 1433.78]  exodus,
[1433.96 --> 1434.22]  that new
[1434.22 --> 1434.80]  liberation,
[1435.28 --> 1435.82]  that new
[1435.82 --> 1436.54]  redemption
[1436.54 --> 1438.46]  and freedom
[1438.46 --> 1439.72]  from idolatry.
[1440.54 --> 1441.28]  And they're
[1441.28 --> 1442.30]  told now the
[1442.30 --> 1443.02]  end you've been
[1443.02 --> 1443.60]  looking for
[1443.60 --> 1444.12]  when all of
[1444.12 --> 1444.94]  this can happen
[1444.94 --> 1445.64]  has come
[1445.64 --> 1446.32]  in Christ.
[1446.96 --> 1447.34]  He made
[1447.34 --> 1448.14]  known to us
[1448.14 --> 1448.74]  the mystery
[1448.74 --> 1449.36]  of his will
[1449.36 --> 1450.02]  according to
[1450.02 --> 1450.40]  his good
[1450.40 --> 1451.46]  pleasure which
[1451.46 --> 1452.12]  he purposed
[1452.12 --> 1453.00]  in Christ to
[1453.00 --> 1453.68]  be put into
[1453.68 --> 1454.84]  effect when
[1454.84 --> 1455.80]  times will have
[1455.80 --> 1456.24]  reached their
[1456.24 --> 1457.34]  fulfillment to
[1457.34 --> 1458.24]  bring unity to
[1458.24 --> 1458.98]  things in heaven
[1458.98 --> 1459.78]  and earth under
[1459.78 --> 1460.34]  Christ.
[1460.58 --> 1461.30]  He's going to
[1461.30 --> 1462.22]  unify that
[1462.22 --> 1462.86]  creation.
[1463.36 --> 1463.74]  He's going to
[1463.74 --> 1464.32]  bring together
[1464.32 --> 1465.18]  God and
[1465.18 --> 1466.08]  God's space
[1466.08 --> 1466.92]  with human
[1466.92 --> 1467.60]  space in the
[1467.60 --> 1468.66]  creation and
[1468.66 --> 1469.60]  that unity is
[1469.60 --> 1470.24]  going to finally
[1470.24 --> 1471.48]  bring about
[1471.48 --> 1472.00]  blessing.
[1473.26 --> 1473.88]  And finally
[1473.88 --> 1475.08]  he's going to
[1475.08 --> 1475.92]  give them
[1475.92 --> 1476.86]  not simply
[1476.86 --> 1478.06]  the land
[1478.06 --> 1478.58]  as their
[1478.58 --> 1479.10]  inheritance
[1479.10 --> 1479.80]  but the whole
[1479.80 --> 1480.38]  creation.
[1481.20 --> 1481.82]  In him we
[1481.82 --> 1482.64]  also have been
[1482.64 --> 1483.58]  made heirs
[1483.58 --> 1484.44]  having been
[1484.44 --> 1485.22]  predestined
[1485.22 --> 1485.80]  according to
[1485.80 --> 1486.40]  the plan of
[1486.40 --> 1486.96]  him who works
[1486.96 --> 1487.72]  out everything
[1487.72 --> 1489.06]  in conformity
[1489.06 --> 1489.76]  with the purpose
[1489.76 --> 1490.44]  of his will
[1490.44 --> 1491.52]  in order that
[1491.52 --> 1492.26]  we who are the
[1492.26 --> 1492.80]  first to put
[1492.80 --> 1493.42]  our hope in
[1493.42 --> 1494.62]  Christ might be
[1494.62 --> 1495.74]  for the praise
[1495.74 --> 1496.66]  of his glory.
[1498.10 --> 1499.62]  Israel can
[1499.62 --> 1500.56]  now enjoy
[1500.56 --> 1502.24]  everything that
[1502.24 --> 1502.56]  has been
[1502.56 --> 1503.32]  promised to
[1503.32 --> 1503.92]  them in that
[1503.92 --> 1505.14]  long story
[1505.14 --> 1506.78]  chosen to
[1506.78 --> 1507.40]  be holy
[1507.40 --> 1508.96]  adopted to
[1508.96 --> 1509.84]  live for the
[1509.84 --> 1510.68]  glory of his
[1510.68 --> 1512.14]  grace experiencing
[1512.14 --> 1513.34]  the inheritance
[1513.34 --> 1514.14]  of the new
[1514.14 --> 1514.80]  creation.
[1515.68 --> 1516.40]  Everything God
[1516.40 --> 1517.02]  has promised
[1517.02 --> 1517.82]  they now can
[1517.82 --> 1518.90]  enjoy how?
[1520.16 --> 1520.60]  In
[1520.60 --> 1522.12]  Christ.
[1522.98 --> 1523.92]  Ten times
[1523.92 --> 1524.68]  in this passage
[1524.68 --> 1525.58]  it says in
[1525.58 --> 1526.30]  Christ or
[1526.30 --> 1527.24]  through Christ
[1527.24 --> 1527.66]  or some
[1527.66 --> 1528.18]  equivalent.
[1528.76 --> 1529.28]  It's in
[1529.28 --> 1529.98]  Christ they
[1529.98 --> 1530.58]  can enjoy
[1530.58 --> 1531.06]  this.
[1531.06 --> 1532.82]  but here's
[1532.82 --> 1533.96]  the wonderful
[1533.96 --> 1534.64]  thing that
[1534.64 --> 1535.18]  Paul now
[1535.18 --> 1535.82]  realizes
[1535.82 --> 1537.36]  is that in
[1537.36 --> 1538.00]  Christ
[1538.00 --> 1539.96]  the Gentiles
[1539.96 --> 1540.84]  in Ephesus
[1540.84 --> 1542.20]  and the
[1542.20 --> 1543.02]  Gentiles
[1543.02 --> 1544.24]  in Surrey
[1544.24 --> 1545.44]  can be
[1545.44 --> 1546.42]  included in
[1546.42 --> 1547.22]  this blessing
[1547.22 --> 1547.88]  of Israel
[1547.88 --> 1549.10]  by believing
[1549.10 --> 1549.84]  the gospel
[1549.84 --> 1551.22]  and by receiving
[1551.22 --> 1551.88]  the spirit.
[1552.36 --> 1552.84]  This is what he
[1552.84 --> 1553.28]  says
[1553.28 --> 1555.00]  and you
[1555.00 --> 1556.34]  also
[1556.34 --> 1558.78]  you Gentiles
[1558.78 --> 1559.52]  that were not
[1559.52 --> 1560.14]  part of this
[1560.14 --> 1560.56]  story.
[1561.30 --> 1562.00]  You also
[1562.00 --> 1563.40]  were included
[1563.40 --> 1564.82]  in Christ
[1564.82 --> 1566.08]  when you
[1566.08 --> 1566.82]  heard
[1566.82 --> 1567.96]  the word
[1567.96 --> 1569.16]  of truth
[1569.16 --> 1570.26]  the gospel
[1570.26 --> 1570.68]  of your
[1570.68 --> 1571.24]  salvation.
[1571.90 --> 1572.50]  When you
[1572.50 --> 1573.20]  believed that
[1573.20 --> 1573.74]  good news
[1573.74 --> 1574.40]  you too
[1574.40 --> 1575.26]  were included
[1575.26 --> 1576.32]  into this
[1576.32 --> 1576.86]  story
[1576.86 --> 1577.62]  into this
[1577.62 --> 1578.24]  story of
[1578.24 --> 1578.66]  blessing.
[1579.58 --> 1579.94]  When you
[1579.94 --> 1580.60]  believed
[1580.60 --> 1581.60]  you were
[1581.60 --> 1582.48]  marked in
[1582.48 --> 1583.18]  him with a
[1583.18 --> 1583.72]  seal the
[1583.72 --> 1584.14]  promised
[1584.14 --> 1584.86]  Holy Spirit
[1584.86 --> 1585.80]  who is a
[1585.80 --> 1586.38]  deposit
[1586.38 --> 1587.64]  guaranteeing
[1587.64 --> 1588.48]  our inheritance
[1588.48 --> 1589.48]  until the
[1589.48 --> 1589.84]  redemption
[1589.84 --> 1590.62]  of those
[1590.62 --> 1591.12]  who are
[1591.12 --> 1591.62]  God's
[1591.62 --> 1592.24]  possession
[1592.24 --> 1593.06]  to the
[1593.06 --> 1593.70]  praise of
[1593.70 --> 1594.30]  his glory.
[1595.32 --> 1596.16]  Brothers
[1596.16 --> 1596.82]  and sisters
[1596.82 --> 1598.22]  what Paul
[1598.22 --> 1598.70]  is saying
[1598.70 --> 1599.32]  to Ephesus
[1599.32 --> 1600.10]  he's saying
[1600.10 --> 1600.80]  to us
[1600.80 --> 1602.50]  we now
[1602.50 --> 1604.06]  share
[1604.06 --> 1605.94]  in Israel's
[1605.94 --> 1606.64]  blessing
[1606.64 --> 1608.60]  the promise
[1608.60 --> 1609.38]  made to them
[1609.38 --> 1610.52]  we share
[1610.52 --> 1611.24]  in Israel's
[1611.24 --> 1611.86]  election
[1611.86 --> 1613.44]  in Israel's
[1613.44 --> 1614.10]  holiness
[1614.10 --> 1615.64]  in Israel's
[1615.64 --> 1616.22]  adoption
[1616.22 --> 1616.78]  to live
[1616.78 --> 1617.10]  for the
[1617.10 --> 1617.60]  praise of
[1617.60 --> 1618.20]  his glory
[1618.20 --> 1619.48]  in Israel's
[1619.48 --> 1620.00]  forgiveness
[1620.00 --> 1621.48]  in Israel's
[1621.48 --> 1622.10]  liberation
[1622.10 --> 1623.08]  and redemption
[1623.08 --> 1624.94]  and Israel's
[1624.94 --> 1625.64]  inheritance
[1625.64 --> 1626.68]  is also
[1626.68 --> 1627.32]  ours
[1627.32 --> 1628.58]  all
[1628.58 --> 1629.26]  through the
[1629.26 --> 1629.76]  gospel
[1629.76 --> 1630.88]  and the
[1630.88 --> 1631.32]  gift of
[1631.32 --> 1631.92]  the spirit.
[1634.72 --> 1635.78]  So what
[1635.78 --> 1636.08]  does that
[1636.08 --> 1636.50]  mean
[1636.50 --> 1638.18]  for us
[1638.18 --> 1638.54]  today?
[1639.74 --> 1640.68]  First
[1640.68 --> 1642.16]  we are
[1642.16 --> 1642.68]  a people
[1642.68 --> 1644.54]  who know
[1644.54 --> 1645.88]  the source
[1645.88 --> 1647.28]  blessing
[1647.28 --> 1647.84]  of true
[1647.84 --> 1649.48]  blessing.
[1649.48 --> 1650.00]  True blessing
[1650.00 --> 1650.52]  that has been
[1650.52 --> 1651.26]  found in
[1651.26 --> 1651.72]  Christ
[1651.72 --> 1652.88]  as we
[1652.88 --> 1653.50]  more and
[1653.50 --> 1654.42]  more conform
[1654.42 --> 1655.12]  to God's
[1655.12 --> 1655.72]  purpose
[1655.72 --> 1656.96]  and intention
[1656.96 --> 1658.44]  and design.
[1658.44 --> 1659.22]  As we are
[1659.22 --> 1659.78]  more and more
[1659.78 --> 1661.58]  restored in
[1661.58 --> 1662.58]  Christ to our
[1662.58 --> 1663.44]  true humanity
[1663.44 --> 1664.40]  according to what
[1664.40 --> 1665.28]  God intended
[1665.28 --> 1666.26]  for human life.
[1667.26 --> 1668.16]  Brothers and
[1668.16 --> 1668.82]  sisters we are
[1668.82 --> 1669.46]  the people
[1669.46 --> 1670.96]  who know
[1670.96 --> 1672.50]  that blessing
[1672.50 --> 1673.02]  is not
[1673.02 --> 1673.90]  found in
[1673.90 --> 1675.12]  pursuing more
[1675.12 --> 1675.76]  and more
[1675.76 --> 1676.64]  things
[1676.64 --> 1678.16]  or more
[1678.16 --> 1678.84]  and more
[1678.84 --> 1679.90]  experiences.
[1680.78 --> 1681.26]  That that
[1681.26 --> 1682.06]  blessing is not
[1682.06 --> 1682.78]  found in
[1682.78 --> 1683.58]  entertainment
[1683.58 --> 1685.32]  or music
[1685.32 --> 1686.50]  or social
[1686.50 --> 1686.96]  media
[1686.96 --> 1688.82]  or sports
[1688.82 --> 1690.60]  my weakness.
[1692.06 --> 1692.62]  Entertainment
[1692.62 --> 1693.74]  no.
[1694.40 --> 1694.98]  Travel
[1694.98 --> 1696.50]  the perfect
[1696.50 --> 1697.20]  retirement
[1697.20 --> 1698.80]  sex
[1698.80 --> 1700.44]  relationships
[1700.44 --> 1702.00]  none of
[1702.00 --> 1702.56]  that is the
[1702.56 --> 1703.26]  place where
[1703.26 --> 1703.98]  blessing can
[1703.98 --> 1704.44]  be found
[1704.44 --> 1705.38]  even though
[1705.38 --> 1706.44]  those things
[1706.44 --> 1707.52]  are good
[1707.52 --> 1708.36]  gifts of
[1708.36 --> 1708.84]  God in
[1708.84 --> 1709.52]  the creation
[1709.52 --> 1710.84]  to be enjoyed
[1710.84 --> 1711.68]  and delighted
[1711.68 --> 1712.08]  in.
[1713.32 --> 1714.28]  But pursuing
[1714.28 --> 1715.74]  joy and
[1715.74 --> 1716.66]  blessing there
[1716.66 --> 1718.04]  is like a
[1718.04 --> 1718.44]  leaky
[1718.44 --> 1719.52]  cistern.
[1720.78 --> 1721.40]  Christ is
[1721.40 --> 1721.92]  that living
[1721.92 --> 1722.38]  water.
[1722.62 --> 1723.54]  And that
[1723.54 --> 1724.48]  gift comes
[1724.48 --> 1725.16]  to us
[1725.16 --> 1726.46]  paradoxically
[1726.46 --> 1727.34]  as we
[1727.34 --> 1728.52]  pursue God
[1728.52 --> 1729.54]  and serve
[1729.54 --> 1730.28]  others
[1730.28 --> 1731.44]  sacrificially.
[1731.98 --> 1732.38]  Isn't that
[1732.38 --> 1732.86]  shocking?
[1733.36 --> 1733.92]  That if we
[1733.92 --> 1735.10]  pursue blessing
[1735.10 --> 1736.76]  it evades
[1736.76 --> 1737.20]  us.
[1737.68 --> 1738.26]  But as we
[1738.26 --> 1739.22]  pursue God
[1739.22 --> 1740.32]  and serving
[1740.32 --> 1741.02]  others
[1741.02 --> 1742.14]  then we are
[1742.14 --> 1742.84]  overwhelmed
[1742.84 --> 1744.06]  by blessing.
[1744.56 --> 1744.84]  We are
[1744.84 --> 1745.36]  able to
[1745.36 --> 1746.40]  enjoy all
[1746.40 --> 1746.92]  the good
[1746.92 --> 1747.54]  gifts of
[1747.54 --> 1748.32]  his creation
[1748.32 --> 1749.58]  enjoy God
[1749.58 --> 1749.98]  himself
[1749.98 --> 1750.96]  and to be
[1750.96 --> 1751.28]  able to
[1751.28 --> 1752.04]  praise God
[1752.04 --> 1752.54]  for him.
[1752.54 --> 1753.42]  Brothers and
[1753.42 --> 1754.00]  sisters we
[1754.00 --> 1754.46]  know the
[1754.46 --> 1755.96]  source of
[1755.96 --> 1756.90]  that longing
[1756.90 --> 1757.42]  that Mick
[1757.42 --> 1758.16]  Jagger had
[1758.16 --> 1758.70]  when he
[1758.70 --> 1759.18]  could not
[1759.18 --> 1759.54]  get
[1759.54 --> 1760.40]  satisfaction.
[1761.40 --> 1762.44]  But second
[1762.44 --> 1764.00]  we are a
[1764.00 --> 1765.52]  people who
[1765.52 --> 1766.06]  share a
[1766.06 --> 1767.78]  vocation to
[1767.78 --> 1768.78]  make known
[1768.78 --> 1769.94]  that blessing
[1769.94 --> 1770.90]  in our lives
[1770.90 --> 1771.28]  and our
[1771.28 --> 1771.76]  words.
[1772.86 --> 1773.26]  You see
[1773.26 --> 1773.50]  our
[1773.50 --> 1774.60]  contemporaries
[1774.60 --> 1775.80]  those around
[1775.80 --> 1776.22]  us are
[1776.22 --> 1777.00]  searching for
[1777.00 --> 1777.60]  that deep
[1777.60 --> 1778.38]  satisfaction.
[1778.38 --> 1779.80]  searching for
[1779.80 --> 1780.52]  that blessing
[1780.52 --> 1781.86]  searching for
[1781.86 --> 1782.72]  that flourishing
[1782.72 --> 1783.92]  in all the
[1783.92 --> 1785.14]  wrong places
[1785.14 --> 1786.36]  in idols.
[1787.36 --> 1788.00]  And like
[1788.00 --> 1788.72]  the prodigal
[1788.72 --> 1790.22]  son of the
[1790.22 --> 1790.68]  book of
[1790.68 --> 1792.72]  Luke looks
[1792.72 --> 1793.46]  for life
[1793.46 --> 1794.36]  among the
[1794.36 --> 1795.52]  pigs and
[1795.52 --> 1795.98]  among the
[1795.98 --> 1796.80]  piggy food
[1796.80 --> 1798.10]  eating their
[1798.10 --> 1799.44]  food when the
[1799.44 --> 1800.26]  father has
[1800.26 --> 1801.16]  this sumptuous
[1801.16 --> 1801.64]  fare.
[1802.42 --> 1803.30]  That's what our
[1803.30 --> 1804.22]  contemporaries is
[1804.22 --> 1805.04]  they look for
[1805.04 --> 1806.04]  that satisfaction
[1806.04 --> 1806.96]  other than in
[1806.96 --> 1807.42]  Christ.
[1808.70 --> 1809.82]  So if that is
[1809.82 --> 1810.54]  our calling
[1810.54 --> 1812.00]  what would a
[1812.00 --> 1813.14]  blessed community
[1813.14 --> 1814.76]  look like
[1814.76 --> 1815.70]  today?
[1817.78 --> 1818.56]  First
[1818.56 --> 1821.22]  it would be a
[1821.22 --> 1821.66]  community
[1821.66 --> 1823.74]  of contentment.
[1824.38 --> 1825.30]  We have
[1825.30 --> 1825.76]  enough.
[1827.64 --> 1828.62]  A community
[1828.62 --> 1829.56]  of simplicity.
[1830.88 --> 1831.88]  A community
[1831.88 --> 1834.14]  of generosity.
[1834.14 --> 1836.72]  in a world
[1836.72 --> 1837.70]  that has an
[1837.70 --> 1839.16]  insatiable desire
[1839.16 --> 1839.82]  for more
[1839.82 --> 1841.48]  and insatiable
[1841.48 --> 1842.04]  greed.
[1843.94 --> 1844.74]  It would be a
[1844.74 --> 1845.50]  community of
[1845.50 --> 1846.26]  patience
[1846.26 --> 1848.26]  and self
[1848.26 --> 1849.12]  control
[1849.12 --> 1851.12]  in a world
[1851.12 --> 1851.94]  that needs
[1851.94 --> 1852.92]  to have that
[1852.92 --> 1853.66]  satisfaction
[1853.66 --> 1854.32]  quickly
[1854.32 --> 1855.10]  instant
[1855.10 --> 1856.06]  gratification.
[1857.68 --> 1858.78]  It would be a
[1858.78 --> 1859.46]  community of
[1859.46 --> 1860.16]  joy
[1860.16 --> 1862.60]  and thankfulness
[1862.60 --> 1864.04]  that lived in
[1864.04 --> 1865.62]  constant thanksgiving
[1865.62 --> 1866.86]  with a deep
[1866.86 --> 1867.44]  sense that
[1867.44 --> 1868.16]  everything we
[1868.16 --> 1868.84]  have comes
[1868.84 --> 1869.56]  from God
[1869.56 --> 1871.36]  in a world
[1871.36 --> 1872.36]  where there's
[1872.36 --> 1873.08]  constant
[1873.08 --> 1874.46]  dissatisfaction
[1874.46 --> 1875.36]  and desire
[1875.36 --> 1876.00]  for more.
[1877.60 --> 1878.22]  It would be a
[1878.22 --> 1878.78]  community
[1878.78 --> 1880.88]  of selfless
[1880.88 --> 1882.22]  giving
[1882.22 --> 1884.52]  and sacrificial
[1884.52 --> 1885.28]  service.
[1886.62 --> 1887.64]  It would be a
[1887.64 --> 1888.48]  life where we
[1888.48 --> 1889.70]  pour out ourselves
[1889.70 --> 1890.66]  in giving
[1890.66 --> 1891.64]  for the sake
[1891.64 --> 1892.46]  of others
[1892.46 --> 1893.88]  in a world
[1893.88 --> 1895.02]  of selfishness
[1895.02 --> 1897.42]  self-centeredness
[1897.42 --> 1899.52]  narcissism
[1899.52 --> 1901.44]  and entitlement.
[1903.44 --> 1904.78]  Be a community
[1904.78 --> 1905.58]  of authentic
[1905.58 --> 1906.40]  character
[1906.40 --> 1908.36]  in a world
[1908.36 --> 1909.58]  of surface image.
[1911.38 --> 1912.76]  Read the other
[1912.76 --> 1913.58]  day an article
[1913.58 --> 1915.00]  and it was an article
[1915.00 --> 1915.84]  of some of the
[1915.84 --> 1916.32]  top
[1916.32 --> 1918.04]  quote unquote
[1918.04 --> 1918.98]  influencers
[1918.98 --> 1919.90]  of our day
[1919.90 --> 1921.80]  and it talked
[1921.80 --> 1922.38]  about how
[1922.38 --> 1923.34]  they were staging
[1923.34 --> 1924.02]  so much
[1924.02 --> 1924.56]  to make their
[1924.56 --> 1925.46]  lives look
[1925.46 --> 1926.28]  so exciting
[1926.28 --> 1927.52]  and how behind
[1927.52 --> 1928.08]  the scenes
[1928.08 --> 1928.68]  their lives
[1928.68 --> 1929.70]  were so miserable
[1929.70 --> 1931.28]  and so fake.
[1932.34 --> 1933.02]  There was a
[1933.02 --> 1933.98]  surface image
[1933.98 --> 1934.76]  of all this
[1934.76 --> 1935.76]  delight that they
[1935.76 --> 1936.26]  were having
[1936.26 --> 1937.28]  that they portrayed
[1937.28 --> 1938.28]  in the social media
[1938.28 --> 1939.32]  but behind
[1939.32 --> 1940.12]  there was no
[1940.12 --> 1940.54]  blessing.
[1941.10 --> 1942.04]  There was misery.
[1942.52 --> 1943.34]  It was all fake.
[1944.64 --> 1945.36]  A community
[1945.36 --> 1946.70]  of stewardship
[1946.70 --> 1948.58]  in a world
[1948.58 --> 1949.36]  of waste
[1949.36 --> 1952.08]  and a community
[1952.08 --> 1953.04]  that seeks
[1953.04 --> 1953.84]  justice
[1953.84 --> 1955.22]  in a world
[1955.22 --> 1956.08]  of economic
[1956.08 --> 1957.80]  and ecological
[1957.80 --> 1959.22]  injustice.
[1961.16 --> 1961.84]  You see
[1961.84 --> 1962.52]  a community
[1962.52 --> 1963.56]  that lived
[1963.56 --> 1964.28]  like that
[1964.28 --> 1965.88]  would begin
[1965.88 --> 1966.90]  to experience
[1966.90 --> 1967.76]  even in our
[1967.76 --> 1968.82]  broken world
[1968.82 --> 1970.50]  the power
[1970.50 --> 1971.24]  of the spirit
[1971.24 --> 1971.80]  bringing
[1971.80 --> 1973.26]  those spiritual
[1973.26 --> 1973.88]  blessings.
[1973.88 --> 1975.18]  a deep
[1975.18 --> 1975.92]  satisfaction
[1975.92 --> 1976.82]  and a blessing
[1976.82 --> 1977.48]  knowing
[1977.48 --> 1979.62]  where the story
[1979.62 --> 1980.36]  is going.
[1981.88 --> 1983.44]  In Isaiah 65
[1983.44 --> 1985.68]  God promises
[1985.68 --> 1986.48]  a new heaven
[1986.48 --> 1987.44]  and a new earth
[1987.44 --> 1988.72]  a creation
[1988.72 --> 1989.48]  that will be
[1989.48 --> 1990.02]  restored
[1990.02 --> 1991.88]  and he says
[1991.88 --> 1992.46]  of those
[1992.46 --> 1993.44]  who inherit it
[1993.44 --> 1995.58]  in Isaiah 65
[1995.58 --> 1996.26]  23
[1996.26 --> 1997.52]  they will be
[1997.52 --> 1998.32]  a people
[1998.32 --> 1999.80]  blessed
[1999.80 --> 2001.56]  by the Lord
[2001.56 --> 2002.78]  they
[2002.78 --> 2003.56]  and their
[2003.56 --> 2004.10]  descendants
[2004.10 --> 2005.28]  with them.
[2006.26 --> 2007.06]  That's where
[2007.06 --> 2008.14]  the story's going
[2008.14 --> 2010.20]  and in age
[2010.20 --> 2011.16]  of frustration
[2011.16 --> 2013.10]  and pain
[2013.10 --> 2014.98]  and brokenness
[2014.98 --> 2016.26]  and evil
[2016.26 --> 2017.02]  that seems
[2017.02 --> 2017.78]  to thwart
[2017.78 --> 2018.58]  that blessing
[2018.58 --> 2019.52]  at every turn
[2019.52 --> 2020.84]  we need
[2020.84 --> 2021.78]  to be above
[2021.78 --> 2022.46]  all
[2022.46 --> 2024.14]  a people
[2024.14 --> 2025.82]  of hope
[2025.82 --> 2027.50]  that one
[2027.50 --> 2027.84]  day
[2027.84 --> 2029.32]  that blessing
[2029.32 --> 2030.12]  is going
[2030.12 --> 2030.64]  to come
[2030.64 --> 2031.00]  to the
[2031.00 --> 2031.54]  creation
[2031.54 --> 2032.86]  finally
[2032.86 --> 2034.32]  and completely.
[2035.58 --> 2036.52]  Until that
[2036.52 --> 2036.82]  day
[2036.82 --> 2037.40]  may God
[2037.40 --> 2038.16]  make us
[2038.16 --> 2039.34]  a people
[2039.34 --> 2039.92]  of blessing.
[2040.90 --> 2041.78]  Let's pray
[2041.78 --> 2042.12]  together.
[2045.84 --> 2046.88]  Our Father
[2046.88 --> 2048.34]  we praise
[2048.34 --> 2048.56]  you
[2048.56 --> 2049.10]  and we
[2049.10 --> 2049.82]  thank you
[2049.82 --> 2050.94]  that you
[2050.94 --> 2051.46]  are a
[2051.46 --> 2052.08]  generous
[2052.08 --> 2053.06]  and good
[2053.06 --> 2053.54]  God
[2053.54 --> 2055.40]  a God
[2055.40 --> 2055.74]  who is
[2055.74 --> 2056.54]  a good
[2056.54 --> 2057.16]  and loving
[2057.16 --> 2057.76]  Father
[2057.76 --> 2058.34]  who wants
[2058.34 --> 2058.98]  to provide
[2058.98 --> 2059.42]  us with
[2059.42 --> 2060.22]  all good
[2060.22 --> 2061.40]  and wants
[2061.40 --> 2061.80]  us to
[2061.80 --> 2062.56]  delight in
[2062.56 --> 2062.96]  you
[2062.96 --> 2063.36]  and in
[2063.36 --> 2064.08]  the good
[2064.08 --> 2064.76]  creation
[2064.76 --> 2065.22]  and every
[2065.22 --> 2065.60]  gift
[2065.60 --> 2065.90]  you have
[2065.90 --> 2066.48]  given us.
[2067.78 --> 2068.20]  And Lord
[2068.20 --> 2068.66]  we bow
[2068.66 --> 2069.44]  before you
[2069.44 --> 2070.08]  and confess
[2070.08 --> 2070.76]  our own
[2070.76 --> 2071.26]  guilt
[2071.26 --> 2072.54]  in thwarting
[2072.54 --> 2073.32]  that blessing
[2073.32 --> 2074.36]  by the way
[2074.36 --> 2074.68]  we have
[2074.68 --> 2075.08]  lived.
[2076.10 --> 2076.58]  But Lord
[2076.58 --> 2077.24]  we're thankful
[2077.24 --> 2077.60]  that you
[2077.60 --> 2077.92]  have now
[2077.92 --> 2078.96]  blessed us
[2078.96 --> 2079.64]  by the
[2079.64 --> 2080.04]  Spirit
[2080.04 --> 2081.72]  that you
[2081.72 --> 2082.70]  in Christ
[2082.70 --> 2083.70]  you are
[2083.70 --> 2084.08]  beginning
[2084.08 --> 2084.84]  to restore
[2084.84 --> 2085.54]  that blessing.
[2086.58 --> 2086.92]  And we
[2086.92 --> 2087.38]  pray oh
[2087.38 --> 2087.66]  Lord
[2087.66 --> 2088.58]  that we
[2088.58 --> 2088.92]  would be
[2088.92 --> 2089.50]  a people
[2089.50 --> 2090.16]  that live
[2090.16 --> 2090.54]  out
[2090.54 --> 2092.18]  what is
[2092.18 --> 2092.62]  meant
[2092.62 --> 2093.34]  for human
[2093.34 --> 2093.78]  life.
[2094.84 --> 2095.36]  Restore
[2095.36 --> 2095.80]  us
[2095.80 --> 2096.86]  fill us
[2096.86 --> 2097.64]  with faith
[2097.64 --> 2098.58]  and with
[2098.58 --> 2099.06]  love
[2099.06 --> 2100.92]  with thankfulness
[2100.92 --> 2102.20]  and with
[2102.20 --> 2102.60]  hope.
[2103.30 --> 2103.94]  We pray
[2103.94 --> 2104.54]  in Christ's
[2104.54 --> 2104.78]  name.
[2105.82 --> 2106.12]  Amen.
