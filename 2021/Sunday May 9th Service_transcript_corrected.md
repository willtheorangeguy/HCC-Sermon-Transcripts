[0.00 → 28.00] I love money!
[28.00 → 35.00] I love mommy because she gives me snuggles when I need it and kisses.
[35.00 → 43.00] I'm thankful for my mom because we always have coffee together, we're best friends, and we're snuggle buddies.
[43.00 → 52.00] Happy Mother's Day, Mama. I love you. I'll see you whenever you get home. Furthermore, I love you, Mama.
[52.00 → 58.00] And thank you. Thank you for doing with me. Sweet dreams. You're back.
[58.00 → 66.00] I'm thankful for my mom because she is kind. She makes my breakfast and she gives me hugs.
[66.00 → 78.00] I love you, Mom. I'm thankful that my mom comes on bike rides with me.
[78.00 → 87.00] I love mom because she plays fire trucks with me.
[87.00 → 99.00] Mama, I love you. Even thank you for playing with the water table with me and the rain rock with me.
[99.00 → 102.00] Happy Mother's Day. Bye!
[102.00 → 109.00] I'm thankful for my mom because I really do love her, and she really does love me and I made this for her.
[109.00 → 116.00] I'm thankful for you snuggling us, and you're always happy.
[116.00 → 130.00] Thank you, Mama, for playing with me. I love you. And this is for Mother's Day. I love you as much as heaven and back.
[130.00 → 140.00] I love my mom because she's so kind to us and I also love her because she's such an excellent baker.
[140.00 → 155.00] And the last reason why I love her, but definitely not the last, is how thoughtful she is, and I love her so much because of those key three things.
[155.00 → 162.00] I'm thankful for my mom because she packed me my lunch every day.
[162.00 → 164.82] Hi mom! Happy Mother's Day to the best mom of all.
[165.24 → 168.82] Thank you for being my mom. Thank you for everything you've done for me.
[169.52 → 172.54] I love you mom because you make my life joyful and blessed.
[172.98 → 175.10] Also, you're irreplaceable for me.
[175.40 → 178.56] I love you mom. Have a wonderful Mother's Day.
[180.78 → 183.26] Happy Mother's Day, my mom!
[183.26 → 185.26] We love you!
[185.38 → 186.52] We love you!
[186.64 → 187.20] We love you!
[201.02 → 203.90] Well, good morning, Hope. Can you hear me?
[204.74 → 206.76] Can the people in the back, vehicles hear me?
[207.06 → 209.42] Side vehicles? At home?
[209.74 → 210.72] Can you hear me? Thumbs up?
[210.72 → 216.98] All right. Well, it is a great gift to be together with you in person and online.
[217.54 → 221.94] I'm especially grateful just to see some families for the first time in a very long time
[221.94 → 223.88] and even to meet a new family that's here in person.
[224.68 → 227.56] It's been tough for some of us. You should know who are there.
[227.66 → 230.30] I know some of us, you're jealous that we got to be in worship in the building,
[230.78 → 233.14] but we haven't worshipped with our own families in quite some time.
[233.14 → 235.12] So it's a gift even to have my own family here.
[235.12 → 239.38] I'm very thankful for Sunrise Church that allows us to share this space.
[239.50 → 241.06] I'm thankful that we can worship outside.
[241.90 → 246.02] I don't know if you feel this way, but it feels good to be in your city outside
[246.02 → 249.48] and be reminded that we're the church of this city, that this is our home.
[249.70 → 251.18] This is where we work. It's where we live.
[251.32 → 252.76] And this is the city we get to serve.
[252.86 → 254.44] And so this morning, we get to worship here.
[254.66 → 255.50] That is a gift.
[255.50 → 262.18] I chuckled this week in preparation for the sermon because as a kid, I did a lot of camping
[262.18 → 264.54] and we had worship service at our campground.
[264.62 → 267.26] Did anyone else have worship services at the campgrounds when they were kids?
[268.04 → 269.88] And for those of you probably relate to this,
[269.96 → 272.64] the services that I went to when I was a little kid at our campground,
[272.86 → 276.94] they're always very informal, and they're always very short, which I loved.
[277.14 → 280.52] But I remember the sermons, even as a kid, they were sort of like Sumbawa,
[280.78 → 282.32] Jesus loves you, amen sermons.
[282.32 → 285.84] Like very simple, very, I don't know, light and fluffy.
[286.34 → 289.76] And I feel terrible to tell you that we're doing a series on Revelation
[289.76 → 293.08] and this is not the light and fluffy service.
[293.58 → 295.90] And if you're looking for something really nice and light and fluffy,
[296.12 → 297.98] you just come to Sunrise here at 10 a.m.
[299.22 → 300.68] They'll provide, I'm just joking.
[301.94 → 303.70] Pastor Chris, if you're listening, we love you.
[304.46 → 306.96] And I'll see if I can tone down my Sunrise jokes.
[307.12 → 310.46] Actually, they said to us, when we made this plan to be on this property,
[310.46 → 314.56] Chris said to me, we're going to make Pentecostals out of you guys at Hope.
[315.00 → 318.24] To which I said, we're bringing the Reformation to your backyard.
[319.52 → 320.46] So it begins.
[321.72 → 324.88] If you have your Bibles, I invite you to turn with me to Revelation 2.
[325.32 → 327.60] We're going to read the letter to the church in Pergamum.
[328.50 → 332.30] The not so light and fluffy letter to the church in Pergamum.
[333.92 → 338.22] Which, by the way, you can't time it better to have a letter to Pergamum on Mother's Day.
[338.22 → 340.18] That's my only connection to Mother's Day this morning.
[341.14 → 341.30] Yeah.
[341.86 → 342.24] Okay.
[343.80 → 345.86] This is the letter to the church in Pergamum.
[346.50 → 349.48] To the angel of the church of Pergamum write,
[350.26 → 354.16] these are the words of him who holds the sharp double-edged sword.
[355.02 → 358.46] I know where you live, where Satan has his throne.
[358.88 → 360.52] I told you, it wasn't a light and fluffy sermon.
[361.34 → 362.88] Yet you remain true to my name.
[362.88 → 367.88] You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness,
[368.14 → 371.42] who was put to death in your city, where Satan lives.
[372.44 → 374.58] Nevertheless, I have a few things against you.
[375.34 → 377.80] There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam,
[378.04 → 381.68] who taught Balk to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food,
[381.80 → 384.62] sacrificed to idols, and committed sexual immorality.
[385.60 → 388.82] Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolai tans.
[388.82 → 418.80] It says,
[418.82 → 422.10] Well, some 13 years ago, Brittany and I and our family then,
[422.42 → 426.02] we moved from Ontario to the province of British Columbia here.
[427.12 → 430.04] And one of the things we loved about the trip, which we did in the middle of the winter,
[430.52 → 434.06] was that we got to drive through all these small, quaint little towns in Canada.
[434.16 → 437.28] Does anyone have the chance to do that, to sort of cross-country road trip across Canada?
[437.98 → 441.68] And one of the best things about these small, quaint little towns is their welcome signs.
[441.68 → 450.16] And some of them welcome you to this town of like 300, home of like Annie's favourite waffles in 2019, 2020, and 2021.
[450.66 → 452.10] And it's very cute and quaint.
[452.48 → 455.04] Others, there's a little town, this is actually a town called Waugh,
[455.46 → 457.58] and they are home of the world's largest goose.
[458.08 → 459.22] And we saw that goose.
[459.22 → 462.80] And I have a feeling no one in the world is competing to have a bigger goose,
[462.92 → 466.20] which is like one of the world's worst birds besides crows and seagulls.
[466.82 → 468.20] Then, of course, we came to British Columbia.
[468.48 → 470.02] And what is British Columbia's welcome sign?
[470.52 → 472.46] It's the most arrogant welcome sign in the world.
[472.88 → 475.94] It says, Welcome to BC, the best place on earth.
[475.94 → 478.94] And I remember thinking then, and I still think this is a little bit now,
[479.02 → 481.10] that we have a bit of an ego issue in this province.
[481.64 → 483.28] Surely there are better places to live.
[483.38 → 484.82] I mean, has anyone here been to Ontario?
[487.30 → 490.78] And reading this passage, I think to myself, perhaps if Pergamum had a welcome sign,
[490.82 → 494.82] it would say something sobering like, Welcome to Pergamum, where Satan lives.
[495.74 → 497.52] Or where Satan has his throne.
[498.16 → 500.12] And you might say, You know what, honey, let's go back to Smyrna.
[500.28 → 501.54] I don't feel comfortable in this city.
[502.62 → 505.82] But you realize in this passage that place matters more seriously.
[506.54 → 510.00] And even as we read these letters, there are specific words to specific churches
[510.00 → 511.70] throughout Asia Minor that we've been looking at.
[512.04 → 514.24] And this is no different here in Pergamum.
[514.44 → 517.72] In fact, you'll notice in other letters, we read Jesus' words to the church,
[517.86 → 519.82] prophetic words, I know your deeds.
[519.90 → 521.12] But what does he say here in Pergamum?
[521.58 → 523.02] I know where you live.
[523.68 → 524.72] I know where you live.
[524.78 → 525.54] I know your address.
[525.64 → 529.14] And I know the challenges and the joys that come with being in this particular city.
[529.40 → 535.42] And writers on Revelation, they agree that Pergamum may very well be the most difficult place
[535.42 → 538.74] of all the churches to live in Asia Minor in the first century.
[539.74 → 540.84] And there are a lot of reasons for that.
[540.90 → 544.44] One of them is, Pergamum is the centre of Roman authority.
[544.98 → 547.42] This is where it was a provincial capital.
[547.56 → 549.50] It's where a lot of Roman power resided,
[549.60 → 552.20] where major decisions of policy would be made for the Roman Empire.
[552.52 → 554.22] This is a significant place of power.
[554.98 → 558.16] But secondly, if you remember a number of weeks ago when we started this series,
[558.16 → 559.98] we talked about this imperial cult,
[560.80 → 562.58] where Domitian and others even before him,
[562.74 → 564.00] they didn't just want to have power.
[564.10 → 565.62] They wanted to be worshipped as gods.
[565.74 → 568.52] In fact, Domitian changed his name to mean the eternal king.
[569.28 → 572.00] And Pergamum happened to be a place where the people were like,
[572.38 → 575.02] yes, they built a massive temple.
[575.22 → 577.60] They had worship services where they burn their incense
[577.60 → 580.34] and they'd worship Domitian as the eternal king.
[580.72 → 583.22] This is a place that was proud to be Roman.
[583.34 → 586.02] This is a place where there was a lot of civic loyalty.
[586.02 → 589.72] Perhaps it would have said, welcome to Pergamum, the best place in Rome.
[591.42 → 593.94] And Jesus has a word for the church in Pergamum.
[594.90 → 598.62] In fact, the first word Jesus has for the church is about himself.
[599.40 → 602.02] And Jesus' words about himself, again, are very contextual.
[602.18 → 603.72] They speak into the reality of that day.
[603.78 → 608.26] And it says that Jesus is the one who holds the double-edged sword.
[609.20 → 610.86] That's a strong image.
[611.76 → 613.40] In different passages, it's a different statement.
[613.48 → 615.26] But here it says he holds a double-edged sword.
[615.26 → 617.90] And you remember in Romans 1, when John has a vision of Jesus,
[617.96 → 620.12] he has a sword coming out of his mouth.
[620.98 → 623.16] And here in Pergamum, it's a very specific statement.
[623.90 → 627.92] Because in Pergamum, they had, as the pre-consul would meet,
[628.18 → 630.90] what was called the power of the sword, the right of the sword,
[631.00 → 633.58] which meant they could determine as they gathered together as leaders
[633.58 → 634.94] who lived and who died.
[635.28 → 638.30] If you oppose the Roman Empire, if you broke the law, they could execute you.
[638.36 → 639.52] They had the power of the sword.
[639.52 → 643.86] And Jesus is saying to this city, to the church placed in this place of great power,
[644.62 → 645.58] I have the power.
[646.88 → 649.72] I hold the authority over life and death.
[649.78 → 655.04] Even in this city, even in this place, I am the true person of authority.
[655.24 → 661.22] And so he speaks as the true king who wields the rightful power over life and death.
[662.08 → 663.66] And then, of course, Jesus names the reality.
[663.98 → 666.62] This is where you live, where Satan lives.
[666.62 → 668.14] Now, here's the question.
[668.28 → 669.54] What in the world does that mean?
[670.04 → 672.38] What does it mean to have Satan's throne in your city?
[672.44 → 674.60] Well, there are a lot of different suggestions on that.
[674.70 → 677.68] One is that at the top of the mountain in Pergamum,
[677.88 → 680.70] there is a temple that was built to honour Zeus.
[680.90 → 682.76] And there was actually a throne built in that temple
[682.76 → 685.76] where Zeus would be worshipped to preside there.
[686.20 → 686.92] That's one option.
[687.02 → 688.00] I actually disagree with it.
[688.02 → 690.84] I think when he says this is the city where Satan lives,
[691.04 → 693.26] he's talking about the worship to Domitian.
[693.58 → 696.20] He's talking about this imperial cult where people would burn incense
[696.20 → 698.84] and worship this human as the true king.
[700.02 → 702.86] And Jesus says, this is where Satan resides.
[704.00 → 705.78] Now, as Western people, we don't talk this way.
[706.12 → 708.08] I don't think I've ever heard anyone say, hey, go to that city.
[708.16 → 709.42] That's where Satan lives.
[710.36 → 712.16] It's said in Theatre, the next city over.
[713.20 → 715.60] And I think it's important for us to realize we don't talk about it.
[715.60 → 718.72] Even when we do talk about sort of Satan, demons, et cetera,
[718.76 → 720.68] it's often in a personal attack kind of way.
[720.68 → 725.90] But in Revelation, we just have to get used to the reality that the veil is,
[726.10 → 730.12] Satan is operating in his world, and he's operating through cultural movements.
[730.60 → 732.66] He's operating through cultural institutions.
[733.50 → 737.24] And when this is named, the cult worship and the imperial worship
[737.24 → 741.84] and the power of Rome itself has behind it the work of the evil one
[741.84 → 746.24] who is seeking to undo what Christ has done through the death and resurrection,
[746.24 → 750.18] seeking to undo God establishing his kingdom over his earth
[750.18 → 752.78] and seeking to persecute the church.
[753.40 → 754.18] Very significant.
[754.36 → 759.16] This is a city where a man named Antipas has been killed by the power of Rome.
[761.18 → 765.10] Now, Jesus' first word to the church, like other letters, is a word of encouragement.
[765.86 → 767.34] And why does Jesus encourage them?
[768.24 → 770.14] He encourages them because just like Ephesus,
[770.32 → 773.54] there's a great deal of pressure on the church to conform, but they haven't.
[773.54 → 776.24] They haven't sort of renounced their faith in Jesus.
[776.38 → 777.96] They haven't said they no longer believe in Jesus.
[778.04 → 778.88] They continue to gather.
[779.00 → 779.78] They continue to worship.
[780.04 → 783.36] This is a dogged church that is committed to the name of Jesus.
[783.94 → 784.88] And Jesus commends them.
[784.92 → 786.92] And it's significant that he says, you know,
[787.34 → 790.34] you didn't renounce your faith in me even in the days of Antipas,
[790.56 → 793.06] my faithful witness who was put to death in your city.
[794.06 → 795.32] I mean, just pause for a minute
[795.32 → 797.80] and imagine what it's like worshipping in a church
[797.80 → 799.90] where someone used to be part of your church,
[800.14 → 802.78] but they were killed because of their faith in Jesus.
[803.54 → 806.24] Can you imagine that experience, how it shapes you?
[806.68 → 807.50] Shapes your view of the city,
[807.62 → 808.84] shapes your view of what it means to be a Christian.
[809.00 → 810.40] This is a sobering reality.
[810.52 → 813.56] And Jesus names it, and he says, good on you, church.
[813.92 → 815.98] Even in the midst of the pressure, even with persecution,
[816.36 → 819.50] even with martyrdom, you have not given up the faith.
[820.18 → 823.96] And it's significant that Antipas is named the same way Jesus is named.
[825.10 → 826.72] His name is faithful witness.
[827.50 → 828.68] That's how Jesus is named.
[828.68 → 832.66] This man is honoured for his faith that brought him right to his death.
[832.66 → 836.58] So Jesus commends this church for standing firm,
[836.74 → 838.42] standing faithful, not renouncing the faith.
[838.80 → 843.50] But he then turns in the next statement to challenge this church.
[843.66 → 845.38] And unlike Smyrna, Smyrna gets no challenge.
[845.48 → 847.08] When Pastor Mark preached, he's waiting over there,
[847.74 → 849.50] he got to preach at a church with no challenges.
[849.62 → 852.18] It's just a suffering, poor church that's holding on.
[852.24 → 854.40] But this church, Jesus challenges, which is significant.
[854.90 → 856.60] Because there's a piece of me that thinks, come on,
[856.94 → 858.56] they're suffering, they've had martyrdom,
[858.56 → 860.34] they should get a pass, don't you think?
[860.68 → 861.46] It's hard enough.
[862.14 → 863.64] But Jesus has a word for the church.
[864.42 → 866.76] He says to them, this is a problem.
[867.26 → 869.74] And let's look at what that problem is together.
[871.46 → 875.42] Now, it's helpful to see that the problem in Pergamum is the opposite of Ephesus.
[875.54 → 878.74] The problem of Pergamum in word is compromise.
[879.70 → 882.80] The problem of Pergamum, in another word, is assimilation.
[883.44 → 886.58] If you remember back in Ephesus, when Jesus was speaking to the church there,
[886.58 → 888.94] the church in Ephesus was commended for their hard work.
[889.06 → 892.18] They were commended for seeing false teaching, unfaithful practices,
[892.32 → 893.92] and people seeking authority in the church,
[894.10 → 895.84] and saying, nope, that's not faithful.
[896.02 → 897.06] That's not what Christ taught us.
[897.08 → 897.78] That's not the scriptures.
[898.20 → 902.14] You cannot have room to teach and shape the hearts and minds of our church
[902.14 → 903.56] if this is what you believe.
[904.72 → 907.50] Pergamum needs to take a page out of Ephesus' book.
[907.82 → 911.08] Because Pergamum had the same challenges, the same group even, the Nicolai tans,
[911.30 → 913.38] and they sort of let them be.
[913.38 → 918.36] They sort of accommodated the presence of these people who were teaching very different things
[918.36 → 922.02] and advocating for a very relaxed posture to culture.
[922.80 → 924.42] I mean, imagine being a persecuted church.
[924.52 → 925.70] There's someone in your church who was martyred,
[925.88 → 927.98] and then there's other people within the church who are saying,
[928.70 → 931.10] ah, let's just relax.
[931.66 → 934.02] Let's not get so hung up about the meat offered to idols.
[934.12 → 938.28] Let's not get so hung up about the sexual immorality that's happening at these feasts.
[938.28 → 942.72] Let's relax, then we won't suffer, then we won't lose privilege,
[943.02 → 945.64] then we won't lose prestige and authority in the city.
[945.88 → 948.18] We can just have this faith over here,
[948.32 → 951.74] and we can have a good relationship with the city over here.
[952.84 → 954.68] Accommodation, compromise.
[955.34 → 958.92] And Jesus confronts that in Pergamum.
[959.76 → 964.58] Jesus challenges them to see what's happening right in front of their eyes.
[964.58 → 969.04] Now, it's important to realize this reference to Balaam.
[969.24 → 972.32] I want to highlight this because I think it helps us understand what's really going on.
[972.82 → 975.24] The reference to Balaam is not that there's a group of people in the church
[975.24 → 977.00] who actually hold to the teachings of Balaam,
[977.12 → 979.08] which is an Old Testament prophet from Moab.
[979.30 → 981.40] It's a reference to what happened in that story.
[981.44 → 982.60] And I'll summarize it very briefly.
[982.68 → 983.68] It's from the book of Numbers.
[984.16 → 985.36] And Balaam's a Mobile prophet.
[985.72 → 987.58] The Mobiles were a bit threatened by the size of Israel,
[987.70 → 989.24] and he's sent to curse Israel.
[989.80 → 991.68] Some of you might remember this famous, you know,
[991.84 → 993.90] Bible story from when your kids were in Sunday school,
[993.90 → 996.26] where, you know, Balaam's going to curse the Israelites,
[996.40 → 997.60] and his donkey talks to him,
[997.68 → 999.38] which is probably the inspiration for Shrek.
[999.98 → 1001.66] And then he can't curse Israel.
[1002.26 → 1004.26] And then he's simply unable to do that.
[1004.30 → 1005.24] And so it's a strange situation.
[1005.32 → 1006.36] But what does Balaam do?
[1007.64 → 1011.92] He advises women from Moab to sort of infiltrate Israel,
[1012.92 → 1014.20] lie with their men,
[1014.32 → 1017.62] and then draw these men into false worship to the Mobile gods.
[1018.18 → 1018.96] That's the story.
[1019.42 → 1020.60] And it's a little more explicit than that.
[1020.66 → 1021.98] It's quite a harsh story in many ways.
[1021.98 → 1023.54] But what the point of this is,
[1023.66 → 1025.26] that's what's happening in Pergamum
[1025.26 → 1026.92] through these different groups like the Nicolai tans.
[1026.98 → 1028.80] It's not that they're being destroyed by persecution.
[1029.26 → 1031.12] They're actually having people come into their community,
[1031.42 → 1032.56] have authority in their community,
[1032.68 → 1034.90] and draw the community away from faithfulness to Jesus.
[1035.86 → 1038.64] There's internal division that's pulling people away from Christ.
[1039.08 → 1040.02] They're accommodating,
[1040.72 → 1041.84] and they're assimilating.
[1042.54 → 1043.28] And Jesus says,
[1043.62 → 1044.44] do you see this?
[1044.98 → 1046.22] Do you see the challenge here?
[1046.66 → 1047.56] This is important.
[1047.56 → 1050.98] And it's worth naming that in every church throughout history,
[1051.48 → 1055.08] the two great realities is we will either cave to external pressure
[1055.08 → 1056.84] that will challenge us one way or another.
[1056.94 → 1059.16] And many churches around the world right now have that real.
[1059.60 → 1062.12] And other churches will cave to assimilation
[1062.12 → 1063.86] and compromise that comes from within.
[1064.52 → 1067.30] And Jesus forces us in this passage to see the latter.
[1068.64 → 1070.78] And just to help you see sort of the temptation here,
[1071.12 → 1073.34] I want to just paint the picture of what might be happening,
[1073.46 → 1075.76] probably both in Pergamum and in Theatre.
[1075.76 → 1078.18] And that is that there are temple guilds.
[1078.36 → 1079.82] So when we talk about meat offered to idols,
[1080.06 → 1081.30] it's not like they're going to the market,
[1081.44 → 1082.98] like we see probably in Paul's letters,
[1083.04 → 1084.92] and they buy meat that had previously been sacrificed
[1084.92 → 1085.86] and offered to idols.
[1086.16 → 1087.60] In this case, it's a feast.
[1088.32 → 1090.70] There would be groups of people, trade guilds,
[1090.74 → 1092.10] all sorts of communities in your city,
[1092.14 → 1093.96] and you gather together perhaps on a Friday night,
[1094.06 → 1095.18] and you have a feast.
[1095.42 → 1096.10] This is community.
[1096.22 → 1096.84] This is bonding.
[1096.96 → 1098.92] This is being together with people that you work with
[1098.92 → 1100.18] and love and live beside.
[1100.18 → 1106.16] But that feast was held in honour of a certain god.
[1106.86 → 1110.76] That feast's purpose was to pay homage and worship to a particular god,
[1110.82 → 1112.52] perhaps even Domitian, the emperor himself.
[1112.78 → 1114.80] So that puts the believers in a compromised position.
[1115.28 → 1117.22] Perhaps they were part of these feasts before they were Christians,
[1117.32 → 1118.40] and now they're at these feasts wondering,
[1118.72 → 1119.14] what do we do?
[1119.78 → 1121.02] This is not for Jesus.
[1121.68 → 1124.10] This is not what we're about as Christians who believe that Jesus is Lord.
[1124.14 → 1124.92] What do we do with this meal?
[1124.98 → 1125.86] But more than that,
[1126.12 → 1128.04] many of these temple feasts that would be held,
[1128.04 → 1129.78] they would finish after the meal,
[1129.88 → 1130.82] there would be entertainment,
[1131.22 → 1132.56] and there would be immorality,
[1132.70 → 1134.34] and there would be temptation of all kinds
[1134.34 → 1136.32] for people to practice things sexually
[1136.32 → 1138.26] that are not in line with the kingdom of God.
[1139.02 → 1140.70] And what's happening beyond that
[1140.70 → 1142.10] is the Nicolai tans are saying,
[1142.78 → 1143.54] this is okay.
[1144.46 → 1146.34] They're saying, don't get so hung up over this.
[1146.78 → 1147.52] Enjoy the meal.
[1147.72 → 1148.38] Enjoy the feast.
[1148.76 → 1149.54] Enjoy the entertainment.
[1149.78 → 1153.30] Enjoy all that goes on after hours in this community.
[1154.54 → 1156.38] And Jesus confronts them,
[1156.98 → 1157.92] saying these matters.
[1158.92 → 1160.42] This life matters.
[1160.86 → 1163.92] And you need to shape the hearts and your minds of your believers
[1163.92 → 1166.48] in a way that is in alignment with the kingdom of Jesus.
[1166.88 → 1169.70] And you need to care about not just what happens on Sunday mornings,
[1170.36 → 1173.34] but what happens at the trade guild on Friday nights.
[1174.98 → 1176.88] Now, every church in every culture,
[1176.90 → 1177.66] we've said this before,
[1177.76 → 1178.58] needs to discern,
[1179.32 → 1182.14] what is it that threatens the internal life of the church?
[1182.86 → 1185.00] What are the areas where we are compelled to compromise,
[1185.00 → 1190.58] where we feel the pressure to assimilate to the way of the city that we live in?
[1190.88 → 1191.44] And that takes discernment.
[1191.44 → 1193.44] It takes clarity.
[1193.44 → 1194.56] It takes prayer.
[1195.04 → 1196.02] It takes hard work.
[1196.02 → 1202.74] And we remember again that Pergamum was faithful in addressing the external pressure,
[1203.40 → 1207.98] but they were weak in dealing with what's going on inside their own community.
[1207.98 → 1210.68] And it reminds me of what a missionary once said to me.
[1211.30 → 1212.86] In the training for missionaries,
[1213.36 → 1214.86] they work very hard, of course,
[1214.92 → 1215.60] at language,
[1216.10 → 1217.54] knowing how to contextualize the gospel,
[1218.04 → 1220.10] learning how to live in a city in a different culture.
[1220.10 → 1224.30] And they work very hard at what it means to bear witness to the gospel of Jesus in this different place.
[1224.30 → 1227.96] But often what undercuts missionary work is not the work in the culture.
[1228.44 → 1230.26] It's conflict among the camp.
[1230.78 → 1231.98] It's conflict with other missionaries,
[1232.08 → 1233.26] divisive issues internally.
[1233.86 → 1234.96] And so it is with the church.
[1237.62 → 1241.30] This passage, I think, forces all of us to ask the hard question,
[1241.42 → 1244.52] where might we as a church be compromised?
[1245.76 → 1252.00] Where might the pressure to assimilate be in this city for us as believers at Hope Community Church?
[1252.00 → 1254.50] And that question, I think, we need to ask personally.
[1254.84 → 1258.40] We need to ask on behalf of our families and collectively on behalf of our church.
[1258.92 → 1261.68] And I think that conversation requires you bring other people in
[1261.68 → 1266.12] because I don't think we always have eyes to see how we're compromised.
[1266.90 → 1270.18] I don't always think we have the ability to know how we're just quietly,
[1270.66 → 1273.36] slowly assimilating to the Western way of being.
[1274.50 → 1277.20] I don't think the Nicolai tans who are in this passage
[1277.20 → 1281.04] saw themselves as sort of false teachers going in to destroy a church.
[1282.00 → 1285.06] My hunch is the Nicolai tans went into the community of Pergamum
[1285.06 → 1288.10] and others thinking, we have an enlightened view.
[1289.06 → 1291.42] We have a deeper understanding of these passages.
[1291.94 → 1294.12] We have a new way of seeing reality.
[1294.24 → 1294.94] And it's good.
[1295.24 → 1296.24] It's so insightful.
[1296.34 → 1297.20] You're going to love this.
[1297.28 → 1298.72] They saw this as enlightened teaching.
[1299.10 → 1301.94] And it took discerning, godly people in the church
[1301.94 → 1305.48] to name it, speak into it, and resist it.
[1305.48 → 1308.04] And that reality is in every church.
[1308.94 → 1312.04] You know, this week, I had a chance to see a number of people in our own community.
[1312.74 → 1315.40] And some of you will know, I gave the question to you.
[1315.46 → 1320.90] I said, where do you think we as Hope Community Church are compromised in our culture?
[1320.90 → 1323.70] And so if you don't like what I'm about to say, it's not even from me.
[1323.88 → 1324.40] It's from you.
[1325.64 → 1326.98] Here are some of the things.
[1327.16 → 1329.22] I would say there's a lot of overlap between what I'm about to say.
[1329.28 → 1332.46] Here are some of the things that people shared with me that were very insightful
[1332.46 → 1336.26] on the temptation to assimilate and compromise here in Canada.
[1336.70 → 1337.46] You ready for this?
[1337.96 → 1340.04] Told you this wasn't a campfire Sumbawa sermon.
[1340.04 → 1343.92] Number one, relativism.
[1344.72 → 1348.00] This notion that you can believe what you believe, I'll believe what I believe,
[1348.06 → 1350.18] and we're both mutually true in our own right.
[1350.26 → 1353.26] Just don't impose what you believe on me, and I won't impose what I believe on you.
[1353.94 → 1355.12] You think that about this passage?
[1355.26 → 1355.94] Great, I disagree.
[1356.46 → 1357.34] Don't tell me what you think.
[1357.52 → 1358.36] I've already made up my mind.
[1358.72 → 1362.06] You think this about the exclusivity of Jesus and what he's accomplished in death and resurrection?
[1362.62 → 1363.68] Great, I disagree with you.
[1363.72 → 1365.78] Just don't try to impose what you believe on me.
[1365.78 → 1373.08] And it's interesting to note that the people who mentioned this were some of our younger members at Hope.
[1373.70 → 1378.56] This notion that you just think what you think, I'll think what I think, and we're both equally true.
[1379.84 → 1382.42] I remember someone emailing me a comic a number of years ago,
[1382.68 → 1384.68] and it was a comic of an early church Bible study,
[1384.92 → 1387.22] and it was very sarcastic and satirical,
[1387.30 → 1390.98] and it showed a group of people sitting in a circle with a scroll from Paul, Philippians or whatever,
[1391.52 → 1394.20] and one person says out loud in the caption on the bottom, it says,
[1394.20 → 1399.46] I think what Paul wants us to do is just decide for ourselves what we think this passage means for our own personal lives.
[1401.28 → 1401.64] Relativism.
[1402.12 → 1406.18] The second one, and this is very much in line with this passage, is sexuality.
[1407.62 → 1412.52] Sexuality is an area where many of us, even if we do our own self-examination, feel deeply compromised.
[1413.32 → 1414.66] We feel deeply assimilated.
[1415.38 → 1417.76] There's a sense in which we know how the scriptures teach on scripture,
[1417.98 → 1421.64] and sexuality being expressed in the confines and the covenant of marriage,
[1421.64 → 1423.60] this beautiful gift God gives to his world.
[1424.20 → 1427.82] But we feel the pull of the cultural narrative.
[1428.88 → 1430.96] Isn't that stuffy, that biblical teaching?
[1431.00 → 1432.68] Isn't it traditional, a bit outdated?
[1433.20 → 1434.80] Doesn't it really match our current reality?
[1434.92 → 1439.54] Shouldn't you just be able to explore and define for yourself how you feel sexually,
[1439.66 → 1441.14] how you want to express yourself sexually?
[1441.68 → 1443.94] What's so harmful about picking up Tinder,
[1444.48 → 1447.08] hooking up, and exploring the possibilities?
[1447.08 → 1449.54] That's a powerful narrative.
[1450.30 → 1453.92] And many of us feel the compromising pull of that narrative.
[1455.16 → 1457.28] Or how about self-help spirituality?
[1457.84 → 1460.78] If you go into any bookstore, Chapters, Indigo, Barnes & Noble,
[1460.92 → 1464.64] you're going to see a whole host of books right at the entrance that says,
[1464.70 → 1466.76] here's how you can build a better you.
[1466.76 → 1469.90] And some of these books, they really like Jesus.
[1470.68 → 1472.54] They're like, oh yeah, he's got great teaching here,
[1472.64 → 1475.38] unloving your neighbour, great ethics here, there's prayer he teaches.
[1475.60 → 1478.88] And I sort of draw that into my own journey of self-actualization.
[1479.26 → 1481.16] I take a few nuggets here, a few nuggets there,
[1481.32 → 1483.76] and I'm just working on myself, building my own identity,
[1483.94 → 1484.96] determining my own destiny.
[1485.44 → 1486.50] Jesus is a little piece of it.
[1487.20 → 1488.12] Self-help spirituality.
[1488.12 → 1488.44] Spirituality.
[1488.96 → 1491.54] And the final one that a lot of people said to me
[1491.54 → 1493.74] was health and wealth prosperity gospel,
[1494.70 → 1495.50] which is interesting.
[1496.64 → 1498.38] And obviously there are explicit forms of that,
[1498.44 → 1499.48] where this notion that, you know,
[1499.58 → 1502.96] if you live in God's presence,
[1503.00 → 1504.72] and if you're faithful to him, he's going to bless you,
[1504.74 → 1506.04] and that blessing is going to be monetary.
[1506.28 → 1507.14] It's going to be stuff.
[1507.20 → 1509.30] It's going to be the good consumer life of the West.
[1509.30 → 1512.84] It's this marriage of the idols of the West with the scriptures.
[1514.12 → 1515.56] An unhealthy, unholy marriage.
[1515.98 → 1517.74] And of course, I think there are explicit versions of that,
[1517.74 → 1519.82] but I also think there are ways that we as Christians
[1519.82 → 1522.28] buy into it implicitly in a quiet form.
[1523.04 → 1525.18] And that is, well, if God blesses me,
[1525.26 → 1526.48] it's going to be an easy life.
[1527.08 → 1528.54] And if I don't have that job,
[1528.58 → 1530.64] or if I lost it because of COVID, I'm not blessed.
[1531.08 → 1532.04] And God's not good.
[1532.44 → 1534.24] And that too is an implicit buying into
[1534.24 → 1536.46] a health and wealth gospel prosperity.
[1539.08 → 1539.96] I'll stop there.
[1540.08 → 1541.30] That's just to name a few.
[1541.46 → 1542.48] There were more that were named,
[1542.92 → 1544.62] but I think it's convincing enough
[1544.62 → 1546.48] that there are ways in which we are compromised.
[1547.74 → 1549.40] And Jesus' word to the church is what?
[1550.62 → 1551.64] What's his word to the church?
[1554.12 → 1554.48] Repent.
[1555.78 → 1557.40] In fact, he says it more strongly than that.
[1557.46 → 1558.40] He says, repent.
[1559.56 → 1561.18] Therefore, otherwise I will come to you
[1561.18 → 1562.76] and I will fight against them
[1562.76 → 1564.34] with the sword of my mouth.
[1565.04 → 1566.38] And what Jesus is saying here,
[1566.54 → 1567.48] very strongly,
[1567.90 → 1569.20] is I will war
[1569.20 → 1570.30] and I will bring judgment
[1570.30 → 1572.02] on all idolatrous worship.
[1572.02 → 1573.24] All the false gods,
[1573.34 → 1573.92] the false deities,
[1574.04 → 1574.50] the false worship,
[1574.60 → 1575.62] that's going to receive judgment.
[1575.90 → 1576.84] So do not associate
[1576.84 → 1578.96] with that which will come to judgment
[1578.96 → 1580.08] in the end when I return.
[1580.74 → 1581.48] Or to put it differently,
[1581.86 → 1583.12] don't go with the flow
[1583.12 → 1584.06] of the cultural movement
[1584.06 → 1585.02] because that current
[1585.02 → 1586.14] leads to destruction.
[1587.12 → 1588.70] These are serious words from Jesus.
[1589.88 → 1590.68] Do not compromise.
[1591.30 → 1592.14] Don't go with the flow.
[1592.54 → 1593.40] I am the judge
[1593.40 → 1594.22] and I am coming.
[1595.08 → 1595.84] So repent.
[1595.84 → 1598.32] And repent, I think,
[1598.40 → 1599.28] means a lot of things
[1599.28 → 1599.90] for the church.
[1600.54 → 1601.60] At least as I read it
[1601.60 → 1603.02] as a leader of our own church,
[1603.18 → 1603.84] I think it means
[1603.84 → 1604.86] having hard conversations
[1604.86 → 1606.38] with people
[1606.38 → 1607.60] who might advocate
[1607.60 → 1608.44] for things that simply
[1608.44 → 1609.08] aren't biblical.
[1609.86 → 1611.40] They are what Jesus invites us to be
[1611.40 → 1612.20] as his disciples,
[1612.30 → 1612.92] as his apprenticeship.
[1613.38 → 1614.22] I think this passage
[1614.22 → 1615.54] is an invitation for leaders
[1615.54 → 1616.62] to have hard conversations
[1616.62 → 1618.26] about the life,
[1618.88 → 1619.40] the faith,
[1619.72 → 1621.14] and the practices of the church.
[1621.90 → 1623.14] And that's very hard in the West.
[1623.24 → 1624.46] In fact, as pastors in Coverdale,
[1624.52 → 1624.96] we've joked,
[1625.06 → 1625.60] you know what happens
[1625.60 → 1626.48] when you have hard conversations
[1626.48 → 1626.96] with people?
[1627.64 → 1628.58] They leave your church.
[1628.98 → 1629.96] Then they come to Sunrise.
[1630.58 → 1631.14] And you're like,
[1631.20 → 1631.44] phew,
[1631.94 → 1632.52] now they're past
[1632.52 → 1633.26] the Christmas challenge.
[1633.88 → 1634.48] But seriously,
[1634.56 → 1635.18] that's what happens.
[1635.22 → 1635.40] We're like,
[1635.46 → 1635.68] no, no,
[1635.70 → 1636.88] I don't want you to challenge me.
[1636.90 → 1637.26] I don't want to have
[1637.26 → 1637.86] this hard conversation.
[1637.94 → 1638.50] I'm out of here.
[1638.78 → 1639.96] I'll take my membership elsewhere.
[1642.14 → 1643.56] But I want to nuance this too.
[1643.86 → 1644.66] And I think it's important
[1644.66 → 1645.70] that we hear this letter
[1645.70 → 1646.36] for what it is
[1646.36 → 1647.16] and not hear it
[1647.16 → 1647.92] for what it isn't.
[1648.96 → 1649.82] There is a sense
[1649.82 → 1650.88] in which every church
[1650.88 → 1652.04] is compromised.
[1653.00 → 1653.76] I think, you know,
[1653.78 → 1654.52] we realize that
[1654.52 → 1655.12] there are so many ways
[1655.12 → 1655.76] where we're still
[1655.76 → 1656.64] on the journey
[1656.64 → 1658.34] of learning to be like Christ,
[1658.86 → 1659.68] live like Christ,
[1659.80 → 1660.60] bear faithful witness
[1660.60 → 1661.54] together in this city.
[1661.64 → 1662.70] And we're all broken
[1662.70 → 1664.32] in a whole variety of ways,
[1664.50 → 1665.68] all the way to your leaders.
[1665.68 → 1667.02] This is a broken leader
[1667.02 → 1667.76] in this church.
[1668.12 → 1669.36] And this is not a letter
[1669.36 → 1670.54] saying there can be
[1670.54 → 1672.32] no brokenness in the church.
[1673.06 → 1674.06] This is a letter
[1674.06 → 1675.32] that is specifically aimed
[1675.32 → 1676.18] at people in the church
[1676.18 → 1677.08] who are advocating
[1677.08 → 1678.46] that that's a norm
[1678.46 → 1680.06] and it should be the case.
[1680.94 → 1682.10] The difference perhaps
[1682.10 → 1683.74] is humility and repentance.
[1685.18 → 1686.14] And humility and repentance
[1686.14 → 1687.50] is what we want to breathe
[1687.50 → 1688.78] and live and feed
[1688.78 → 1689.24] in this church.
[1689.30 → 1690.22] Of course we're broken.
[1691.00 → 1691.66] And Pastor Sid,
[1691.72 → 1692.20] who's right there,
[1692.28 → 1692.54] he and I,
[1692.60 → 1693.28] we give thanks
[1693.28 → 1694.54] that we are a church
[1694.54 → 1695.58] that's on journey together.
[1696.04 → 1696.32] In fact,
[1696.44 → 1697.60] there's many people
[1697.60 → 1698.50] who've come into our church
[1698.50 → 1699.98] over the last number of years
[1699.98 → 1701.76] with a very hard story.
[1702.30 → 1702.84] And there are ways
[1702.84 → 1703.54] where they're not sure
[1703.54 → 1704.38] exactly how Jesus
[1704.38 → 1705.06] even works into it.
[1705.10 → 1705.76] And we're delighted
[1705.76 → 1706.32] that they're coming
[1706.32 → 1707.02] into this community
[1707.02 → 1708.36] and we get to journey together.
[1708.64 → 1709.30] We get to learn
[1709.30 → 1710.22] what the scriptures teach,
[1710.46 → 1711.42] what it means to follow Christ,
[1711.52 → 1712.44] what it means to be faithful,
[1712.74 → 1713.90] how to put off the old self
[1713.90 → 1714.86] and put on the new self.
[1715.10 → 1716.12] We delight ourselves
[1716.12 → 1717.08] that we get to be a community
[1717.08 → 1718.04] that is growing
[1718.04 → 1719.00] in the likeness of Jesus.
[1719.22 → 1720.06] That was what our whole
[1720.06 → 1721.34] last sermon series was about.
[1721.84 → 1722.50] But that's not what
[1722.50 → 1723.34] this letter is addressing.
[1724.42 → 1724.96] This letter is addressing
[1724.96 → 1726.26] people in the church
[1726.26 → 1727.38] who are advocating
[1727.38 → 1728.90] for the normalization
[1728.90 → 1730.70] of compromise to culture.
[1731.64 → 1733.02] And we've experienced this too.
[1733.84 → 1734.02] You know,
[1734.06 → 1734.50] we've had people
[1734.50 → 1735.08] come into our church
[1735.08 → 1735.74] who are new to the faith
[1735.74 → 1736.06] and we're like,
[1736.16 → 1736.34] yes,
[1736.34 → 1737.12] let's journey together,
[1737.22 → 1737.70] let's sort out
[1737.70 → 1738.82] the messiness of life together.
[1738.90 → 1739.78] But we've also had people
[1739.78 → 1740.38] who come to Hope
[1740.38 → 1741.44] on occasion
[1741.44 → 1742.90] and they've left
[1742.90 → 1744.10] their last church in a huff.
[1744.52 → 1745.52] There's conflict there.
[1745.82 → 1746.80] There's drama there.
[1747.00 → 1747.64] They've got a chip
[1747.64 → 1748.22] on their shoulder.
[1748.36 → 1748.92] They're driven
[1748.92 → 1750.30] by one particular issue
[1750.30 → 1750.88] or another.
[1751.58 → 1752.52] And we've said to them,
[1752.58 → 1752.98] you know what?
[1753.96 → 1754.94] This isn't your church.
[1756.06 → 1756.92] This isn't the place
[1756.92 → 1757.68] where you're going to thrive.
[1758.24 → 1759.34] And this isn't the community
[1759.34 → 1760.44] where we're going to make this
[1760.44 → 1761.50] what our church is about
[1761.50 → 1762.20] because we don't believe
[1762.20 → 1763.24] that's what the scriptures teach.
[1764.08 → 1765.06] And we do that
[1765.06 → 1765.86] because we love them.
[1766.62 → 1767.44] And then we send them again
[1767.44 → 1767.94] to Sunrise.
[1769.20 → 1769.56] Okay,
[1769.58 → 1770.68] that's my last Sunrise joke.
[1771.24 → 1771.84] But in seriousness,
[1771.84 → 1772.38] we do that because
[1772.38 → 1773.24] we love this church
[1773.24 → 1774.06] and we feel called
[1774.06 → 1774.50] as leaders,
[1774.68 → 1774.88] elders,
[1775.04 → 1775.28] deacons,
[1775.32 → 1775.70] and pastors
[1775.70 → 1776.80] to protect this church.
[1777.22 → 1778.06] That's our job.
[1778.46 → 1779.96] To care about how we live,
[1780.22 → 1781.48] what it means to follow Christ,
[1781.58 → 1782.60] what it means to be an apprentice.
[1782.84 → 1783.50] And sometimes,
[1783.50 → 1785.28] that's a hard conversation
[1785.28 → 1787.08] about hard issues
[1787.08 → 1788.26] that we believe
[1788.26 → 1789.30] need to be
[1789.30 → 1790.16] named
[1790.16 → 1791.34] and addressed.
[1792.38 → 1793.14] And I ask
[1793.14 → 1794.80] that you pray for us
[1794.80 → 1795.22] as leaders
[1795.22 → 1796.30] in this city,
[1796.38 → 1796.92] in this time,
[1797.00 → 1798.06] that we remain faithful,
[1798.68 → 1799.96] that we care,
[1800.46 → 1801.72] that we are willing
[1801.72 → 1802.94] and are ready
[1802.94 → 1804.16] to have the hard conversations
[1804.16 → 1805.34] for the sake of the gospel,
[1806.02 → 1806.76] for the sake of being
[1806.76 → 1807.62] a faithful church,
[1807.64 → 1808.48] and for the sake
[1808.48 → 1809.04] of our witness
[1809.04 → 1809.70] in this city.
[1810.38 → 1810.54] You know,
[1810.58 → 1810.80] really,
[1810.92 → 1811.50] in the end of the day,
[1811.56 → 1812.60] what this passage is about
[1812.60 → 1814.10] is assaulting influence
[1814.10 → 1814.56] in the city.
[1814.92 → 1815.86] And if the salt loses,
[1815.98 → 1816.48] it's saltiness.
[1816.60 → 1817.38] If it's assimilated
[1817.38 → 1818.18] and it's compromised,
[1818.18 → 1819.30] it is no good
[1819.30 → 1819.82] for the city.
[1820.26 → 1820.92] This is not just about
[1820.92 → 1821.54] the internal life
[1821.54 → 1821.86] of the church.
[1821.92 → 1822.64] This is about the mission
[1822.64 → 1823.24] of the church
[1823.24 → 1824.08] in the city.
[1824.38 → 1825.38] We need to concern
[1825.38 → 1826.48] ourselves with these things
[1826.48 → 1827.98] and have those conversations.
[1831.02 → 1831.42] Now,
[1831.52 → 1832.22] for the good news
[1832.22 → 1833.42] of the end of this passage.
[1835.16 → 1837.20] To those who are victorious,
[1837.60 → 1838.42] Jesus says,
[1839.22 → 1840.20] I will give
[1840.20 → 1841.68] some hidden manna.
[1842.30 → 1843.64] I will also give
[1843.64 → 1844.44] each of them
[1844.44 → 1845.46] white stone
[1845.46 → 1846.30] with a new name
[1846.30 → 1847.10] written on it,
[1847.34 → 1848.16] known only to the
[1848.16 → 1849.16] one who receives it.
[1849.42 → 1849.60] Now,
[1849.66 → 1850.84] this passage is loaded
[1850.84 → 1852.42] and it is so beautiful.
[1853.34 → 1854.00] First,
[1854.38 → 1855.64] it's calling back
[1855.64 → 1856.68] to the story,
[1856.76 → 1857.02] of course,
[1857.08 → 1858.08] when Israel was wandering
[1858.08 → 1858.70] through the wilderness
[1858.70 → 1860.30] and God miraculously
[1860.30 → 1861.50] provides food for them.
[1861.62 → 1862.44] He shows his power
[1862.44 → 1862.94] and his provision
[1862.94 → 1863.76] by giving them food.
[1864.10 → 1864.72] It's about so much
[1864.72 → 1865.30] more than that.
[1865.64 → 1866.60] All of these passages
[1866.60 → 1867.46] at the end of these letters
[1867.46 → 1868.56] are pointing forward
[1868.56 → 1869.52] to the time
[1869.52 → 1870.54] when Jesus will return
[1870.54 → 1871.74] to make all things new.
[1871.94 → 1872.92] And the promise here
[1872.92 → 1874.18] is that there's a place
[1874.18 → 1875.14] for food
[1875.14 → 1875.78] and for meal
[1875.78 → 1876.58] when Jesus returns.
[1876.70 → 1876.98] In fact,
[1876.98 → 1877.82] one writer
[1877.82 → 1878.68] I really appreciated
[1878.68 → 1878.92] says,
[1878.92 → 1880.12] food weaves its way
[1880.12 → 1880.98] through this whole letter.
[1882.08 → 1882.56] Implicitly,
[1882.64 → 1883.52] this passage is saying,
[1884.06 → 1884.08] yes,
[1884.14 → 1884.68] there are feasts
[1884.68 → 1885.30] at these temples.
[1885.50 → 1885.66] Yes,
[1885.72 → 1886.18] they're dedicated
[1886.18 → 1886.98] to false gods.
[1887.30 → 1887.52] Yes,
[1887.56 → 1888.18] I'm asking you
[1888.18 → 1889.14] not to participate
[1889.14 → 1890.08] in meals
[1890.08 → 1890.66] that are honouring
[1890.66 → 1891.68] some false god.
[1891.86 → 1892.54] But guess what,
[1892.66 → 1892.92] church?
[1893.84 → 1895.10] When Jesus returns
[1895.10 → 1895.96] in glory and power
[1895.96 → 1897.00] to judge all things
[1897.00 → 1898.08] and renew his good world,
[1898.34 → 1898.84] guess what?
[1899.10 → 1900.14] You get to feast
[1900.14 → 1901.34] at the wedding banquet
[1901.34 → 1902.02] of the Lamb.
[1902.66 → 1903.50] There's a seat
[1903.50 → 1904.76] with your name on it
[1904.76 → 1906.44] at his kingdom banquet.
[1906.86 → 1907.58] You are going
[1907.58 → 1908.72] to dine forever
[1908.72 → 1910.00] in the new creation.
[1911.08 → 1911.58] What good news
[1911.58 → 1912.82] that is for a suffering church.
[1913.80 → 1914.42] What good news
[1914.42 → 1915.92] that is for a compromised church.
[1917.34 → 1918.26] Be victorious.
[1919.52 → 1919.96] And of course,
[1920.02 → 1920.44] that reference
[1920.44 → 1921.26] to white stones,
[1921.46 → 1922.22] I was talking
[1922.22 → 1922.54] with someone
[1922.54 → 1923.26] earlier this morning.
[1923.36 → 1923.78] There's, I think,
[1923.82 → 1925.12] 13 different possibilities.
[1925.56 → 1926.50] Here are my two favourites.
[1926.64 → 1927.62] I'm open to being wrong.
[1927.98 → 1928.96] The first is
[1928.96 → 1930.16] that white stones
[1930.16 → 1931.18] were used in the courts
[1931.18 → 1932.66] to speak a word
[1932.66 → 1933.16] of acquittal
[1933.16 → 1933.64] over someone
[1933.64 → 1934.52] who is being judged
[1934.52 → 1935.40] for a certain crime.
[1936.16 → 1937.12] The white stone would say
[1937.12 → 1937.98] they're not guilty.
[1939.16 → 1940.16] And so in this case,
[1940.38 → 1940.80] the statement
[1940.80 → 1941.42] over the church
[1941.42 → 1942.86] is not guilty.
[1943.14 → 1943.60] The statement
[1943.60 → 1944.34] over the believers
[1944.34 → 1945.30] when Jesus returns
[1945.30 → 1946.20] in glory and power
[1946.20 → 1947.72] is not guilty.
[1948.78 → 1949.46] Welcome into
[1949.46 → 1950.18] the new creation
[1950.18 → 1951.60] to be in the presence
[1951.60 → 1952.18] of Christ,
[1952.36 → 1953.50] to live in the freedom
[1953.50 → 1954.58] without sin forever
[1954.58 → 1955.54] in God's good world.
[1955.74 → 1956.44] Not guilty.
[1956.80 → 1957.66] The second option,
[1957.76 → 1958.72] I like this one equally,
[1959.16 → 1960.12] is that white stones
[1960.12 → 1961.34] in this context
[1961.34 → 1961.82] in Pergamum
[1961.82 → 1962.36] where often
[1962.36 → 1963.44] what someone
[1963.44 → 1964.16] would write a name,
[1964.22 → 1965.04] a deity would give
[1965.04 → 1965.82] someone a new name
[1965.82 → 1966.42] when they were part
[1966.42 → 1967.08] of that religion.
[1968.30 → 1969.48] And I liken it to us
[1969.48 → 1970.34] when we enter
[1970.34 → 1971.10] that new creation,
[1971.24 → 1971.80] we are victorious
[1971.80 → 1972.60] because of what Christ
[1972.60 → 1973.62] accomplished on the cross.
[1973.88 → 1974.96] We get a new name
[1974.96 → 1977.00] in his world.
[1977.80 → 1978.78] We get a new name
[1978.78 → 1979.60] in his creation.
[1980.36 → 1980.92] And we see that
[1980.92 → 1981.82] throughout the Bible,
[1981.92 → 1982.08] actually,
[1982.16 → 1982.88] Jesus giving people
[1982.88 → 1983.34] a new name.
[1983.66 → 1984.70] They belong to the church.
[1984.78 → 1985.82] They belong to the body
[1985.82 → 1986.18] of Christ.
[1986.38 → 1987.18] Here's your new name.
[1988.18 → 1989.50] And perhaps it is the case
[1989.50 → 1990.14] that when we get
[1990.14 → 1991.54] to God's new creation,
[1992.18 → 1992.92] his renewed world,
[1992.96 → 1993.92] we will have a new name.
[1994.40 → 1995.40] And we get to live
[1995.40 → 1996.90] and dwell as God's people
[1996.90 → 1998.44] named by him
[1998.44 → 1999.20] with a name he gives
[1999.20 → 2000.52] specifically to us.
[2001.78 → 2002.62] That's the promise,
[2002.74 → 2003.46] the future promise
[2003.46 → 2004.30] given to the church
[2004.30 → 2005.00] that is victorious,
[2005.20 → 2006.58] that shares in Jesus' victory.
[2008.04 → 2009.28] I want to finish my sermon
[2009.28 → 2011.38] in a sort of strange way
[2011.38 → 2012.02] and illustrate it
[2012.02 → 2012.80] in a strange way.
[2013.12 → 2014.24] And I ask for your patience
[2014.24 → 2014.80] because I got to do
[2014.80 → 2015.48] some walking around.
[2015.56 → 2016.20] Are you okay with that?
[2016.26 → 2016.88] Just to hang tight
[2016.88 → 2017.30] for a moment?
[2017.76 → 2018.70] It's going to seem strange
[2018.70 → 2020.10] until about five minutes
[2020.10 → 2020.42] from now.
[2020.56 → 2021.02] Bear with me.
[2021.02 → 2021.06] Bear with me.
[2021.06 → 2021.52] Bear with me.
[2021.52 → 2022.32] Bear with me.
[2022.32 → 2022.60] Bear with me.
[2047.30 → 2072.12] Oh, as far as I go.
[2072.12 → 2072.84] Here we go.
[2075.36 → 2076.46] Am I close enough?
[2077.30 → 2078.02] Can everyone see me?
[2079.90 → 2081.22] All right, what is this?
[2082.12 → 2082.88] It's a rope.
[2083.96 → 2085.30] If you can look close at me,
[2085.88 → 2088.82] you'll see that I have a little piece of blue tape on this rope.
[2089.82 → 2093.46] And this section between the front of the rope and the blue tape
[2093.46 → 2096.32] represents all history as we know it.
[2096.60 → 2097.52] Okay, can you picture that?
[2098.14 → 2099.18] This is the creation.
[2099.98 → 2101.08] Somewhere in here is Abraham.
[2101.08 → 2102.88] Jesus coming somewhere in here.
[2103.66 → 2105.02] Pergamum is somewhere in here.
[2105.10 → 2106.24] And so are you.
[2106.24 → 2110.68] And me and our families at this point in history at time.
[2111.40 → 2116.72] But this blue tape here represents Jesus' second coming.
[2117.68 → 2119.04] The restoration of all things.
[2119.14 → 2120.14] The judgment of evil.
[2120.52 → 2122.48] The renewal of God's whole creation.
[2122.48 → 2127.48] In these letters, I've felt this since we started this series,
[2128.12 → 2131.64] Jesus knows it's hard to live in this reality.
[2131.82 → 2132.58] Still shaped.
[2132.94 → 2133.58] Still affected.
[2133.76 → 2135.46] Still suffering under the brokenness of sin.
[2136.18 → 2138.58] Many of us in our own ways, we've felt that.
[2138.66 → 2140.92] And the older we get, the more we realize life is short.
[2141.74 → 2142.86] Life is hard.
[2143.54 → 2146.40] Our human lives are broken and frail and we die.
[2146.40 → 2151.84] And the word of promise that Jesus gives the churches, and he gives to Hope Community Church this morning is,
[2152.62 → 2153.40] this is coming.
[2154.26 → 2157.10] This renewal, this restoration is coming.
[2157.78 → 2159.88] And to those who are victorious, Jesus says,
[2159.88 → 2163.28] you get all of this.
[2164.04 → 2166.60] You get life in the kingdom coming.
[2167.12 → 2168.68] You get resurrection life.
[2168.78 → 2173.60] You get to dine at the banquet of Jesus Christ with faithful forever.
[2173.60 → 2185.04] You get to live, laugh, camp, eat food, raise kids, enjoy the goodness of creation, work, and enjoy it.
[2185.54 → 2186.04] Forever.
[2186.48 → 2187.62] Just look at the rope for a minute.
[2188.68 → 2190.34] It goes on and on and on.
[2190.40 → 2193.00] And this little blip is history as we know it.
[2193.46 → 2195.32] This is the kingdom that is to come.
[2195.76 → 2197.60] And Jesus' word to the church is,
[2198.34 → 2199.54] live with hope.
[2200.42 → 2201.72] Yes, life is hard.
[2201.72 → 2204.60] Yes, creation's fallen, but I'm coming.
[2205.52 → 2206.88] And I will renew all things.
[2207.02 → 2210.06] And to those who are victorious, who share in my name,
[2210.38 → 2212.16] who live by faith,
[2212.94 → 2214.44] this life awaits you.
[2215.44 → 2217.68] Live in hope.
[2219.24 → 2220.12] Let's pray.
[2224.04 → 2226.56] Father, we thank you for that promise.
[2227.68 → 2231.08] And our prayer this morning is that we would be a victorious church.
[2231.08 → 2235.46] Not in our own strength, but by the strength of Jesus through the cross.
[2235.96 → 2238.60] By the work of the Spirit who's with us even this morning.
[2238.60 → 2239.90] Anyone else, please?
[2240.04 → 2244.44] Well, what do you think the understanding of Lord Christ if we would be a close cousin?
[2244.50 → 2245.80] I just love to feel God so that we can relations with a wife.
[2245.84 → 2246.78] Probably I feel the same for your Antão prefer.
[2247.26 → 2247.58] Anytime you have time.
[2247.70 → 2248.30] You haven't'tempest.
[2248.36 → 2249.94] Hopefully, the story of God is deaf and really looked at it.
[2250.12 → 2251.02] Next time you get to China.
[2251.04 → 2251.10] And to all start with your church.
[2251.28 → 2251.86] Because of our church, everything wants us to do this.
[2252.24 → 2253.26] font of the lighting.
[2257.32 → 2258.10] So it's not going to be a direct side ch of Christ.
[2258.14 → 2259.46] And I've been praying for this.
[2259.52 → 2260.32] This time, I'm Zach if you will Ask.
[2260.56 → 2261.20] And I can get the hall.
[2261.26 → 2262.10] So I'm my iPad.
[2262.10 → 2262.58] My genre will see her.
[2262.64 → 2263.54] And I can speak for you today.
[2263.58 → 2264.34] I can't see it.
[2264.54 → 2265.14] And I have a fatso, please.
