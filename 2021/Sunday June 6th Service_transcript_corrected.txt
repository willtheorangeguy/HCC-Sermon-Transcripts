[0.00 → 29.98] I love you.
[30.00 → 59.98] I love you.
[60.00 → 63.70] It's just a gift to be in worship together, as you've heard already several times this
[63.70 → 63.98] morning.
[64.80 → 68.90] You know, two of my prayers since the beginning of COVID has been, one, that we would be creative
[68.90 → 71.54] and faithful as a scattered church when we cannot gather.
[72.26 → 76.06] But the second prayer has been that when we can gather, we would come back with a greater
[76.06 → 79.40] hunger, a greater sense of what it means to be part of the church.
[79.46 → 82.90] And I pray that that will continue to happen in our own church, that we would not take
[82.90 → 85.96] for granted the gift of being together as the body.
[87.54 → 91.64] We're going to jump back into our sermon series on Revelation this morning after a couple
[91.64 → 93.18] of weeks of taking a break on that.
[93.48 → 97.40] And I've gotten some good feedback from you just about the nature of these letters, which
[97.40 → 98.56] I think are fresh for some of us.
[98.62 → 99.86] We haven't really read them before.
[99.86 → 104.36] And we've realized that there is a unique way that they speak to us week after week of
[104.36 → 108.70] what it means to be uncompromising, what it means to be faithful, what it means to be faithful
[108.70 → 113.38] to Christ and His gospel in all these different circumstances that the cities are facing.
[114.10 → 116.68] This morning, we're going to look at the letter to the church of Philadelphia.
[116.94 → 121.42] So if you have your Bible, turn with me to Revelation 3, and we're going to start in verse 6.
[121.42 → 129.08] Revelation 3.
[151.42 → 181.40] Verse 7.
[181.42 → 211.40] Revelation 3.
[211.42 → 212.42] Revelation 3.
[218.28 → 218.42] Revelation 3.
[218.42 → 221.62] A number of years ago, I got to know a young teenage boy.
[223.34 → 224.42] He was a great kid.
[224.54 → 226.48] He came from a solid Christian family.
[227.42 → 229.20] He's going through a tough season in his life.
[229.32 → 230.56] He just started a new high school.
[230.66 → 231.50] He's in a public school.
[231.70 → 234.42] And it's one of those seasons where things just were not lining up for him.
[234.50 → 235.44] He's struggling with friendship.
[235.64 → 239.14] He's struggling with finding his place in the school, what it means to be a Christian in this
[239.14 → 239.46] season.
[239.46 → 240.92] And there was bullying.
[241.46 → 242.76] And there was difficulty with friendship.
[242.88 → 243.54] There was loneliness.
[244.74 → 245.94] Not a lot of people knew about this.
[246.00 → 246.84] His parents knew.
[246.96 → 247.68] His siblings knew.
[247.82 → 250.04] One of his uncles who he was close with knew.
[250.04 → 254.32] And about seven months into this season, that was very hard for him personally.
[254.32 → 256.70] He got a letter in the mail from that uncle.
[256.70 → 261.24] And that letter was packed full of one thing.
[262.66 → 263.06] Encouragement.
[263.98 → 267.72] The uncle named how he understood what the boy was going through, shared some of his own
[267.72 → 268.20] story.
[268.58 → 271.94] He talked about how he was proud of this boy and the faith he had in Jesus.
[272.34 → 277.42] And he encouraged him to be patient and prayerful in this hard season.
[277.42 → 282.98] That letter meant the world to this teenage boy.
[283.70 → 288.06] There's nothing like an encouraging letter in a season of great difficulty.
[288.76 → 291.08] And I'm not talking text message or Instagram message.
[291.18 → 293.84] I'm talking a real written letter.
[293.84 → 300.32] This letter to the church in Philadelphia, that's this kind of letter.
[301.28 → 302.78] This church is small.
[303.34 → 304.44] It's being persecuted.
[304.76 → 306.76] And there's hostility towards it from certain groups.
[306.84 → 307.56] They're being bullied.
[308.02 → 313.18] And they feel like this strange little community in this city of Philadelphia.
[314.18 → 318.06] And Jesus writes this letter through John to encourage them.
[318.68 → 319.98] This is an encouraging letter.
[319.98 → 323.22] In fact, writers look at this letter to Philadelphia, and they compare it to others, and they say,
[323.38 → 324.66] this isn't like the other letters.
[324.84 → 326.30] It has a different tone to it.
[326.56 → 330.02] And if you pay close attention, you'll know there's something missing from this letter that's
[330.02 → 331.56] present in almost all the other letters.
[331.64 → 332.56] You know what it is this time?
[334.50 → 335.82] There's no challenge.
[337.30 → 341.72] Never do we read in this letter, but I have this against you, which we see in Ephesus and
[341.72 → 344.38] we see in Pergamum, or the letter, you must repent.
[344.78 → 345.72] Not in this letter.
[346.56 → 348.44] Jesus is proud of this church.
[348.44 → 350.60] They've kept faithful to his name.
[350.68 → 354.16] They haven't sort of renounced their faith and the pressure of the groups of people in
[354.16 → 354.50] the city.
[354.96 → 358.10] Jesus knows that they have a little strength because of the heat against the church.
[358.18 → 361.50] He says, I'm encouraged by you.
[362.46 → 363.82] I'm with you.
[364.68 → 369.74] This is an encouraging letter to a small church in the city of Philadelphia.
[371.02 → 375.26] Now, as we've noted before in each of these letters, what Jesus says through John, remember
[375.26 → 379.22] these are prophetic words from Jesus that John writes, they're very contextual.
[379.66 → 383.86] That is to say, what Jesus says to the church in Ephesus has a lot to do with their specific
[383.86 → 384.44] context.
[384.64 → 388.82] And what he says to the church in Philadelphia has a lot to do with their specific context.
[388.92 → 393.40] So let me just briefly sketch some important things about Philadelphia that's going to help
[393.40 → 394.94] us read this letter from Jesus.
[395.62 → 401.98] Number one, Philadelphia is a small, and it's a very recent, it's actually the youngest of all
[401.98 → 404.28] the cities that are written to in these letters.
[404.96 → 407.18] And it was set up for a very specific reason.
[407.84 → 412.10] Philadelphia was established 200 years prior to the writing of this letter by a wealthy
[412.10 → 415.56] colonist from Pergamum, the other city we just looked at a letter to.
[416.18 → 421.06] And the goal of Philadelphia, this is an important detail, was that it would be a gateway city.
[421.58 → 424.56] You see, Philadelphia was sort of on the border of many neighbouring cities.
[424.66 → 426.00] It was part of sort of the Greek empire.
[426.26 → 430.60] And the goal is that this would sort of be a gateway to send the Greek culture, send the
[430.60 → 432.26] Greek language to other cities.
[432.52 → 436.32] And they had a well-known road moving out to the east from this city.
[437.18 → 439.92] In many ways, you might even say it's a missionary city.
[440.38 → 443.62] But the mission was that the Greek culture would go out from Philadelphia.
[444.44 → 445.70] And you'll see why that matters in a minute.
[445.78 → 452.94] But let me just say at the outset, think of how strategic it is for a church to be located
[452.94 → 455.56] in this gateway missionary city.
[455.56 → 462.42] Imagine if it was not just Greek culture, but the gospel that goes out from this city
[462.42 → 464.38] of Philadelphia through the church.
[465.30 → 466.42] That's the first piece of context.
[466.52 → 469.42] Second one is the location of Philadelphia was a tough one.
[469.76 → 474.40] Even though they had amazing crops, amazing soil for growing wine, which is what they did,
[474.44 → 477.40] they had vineyards, they were near a volcanic area.
[477.56 → 479.18] So there's a live volcano nearby.
[479.66 → 484.96] And in actually 17 AD, not long before this was written, that destroyed both Sardis and Philadelphia.
[484.96 → 486.12] But it had to run from the city.
[486.38 → 487.66] The volcano destroyed their city.
[487.76 → 489.58] And now they had gone back to it to rebuild.
[490.34 → 493.14] And Philadelphia, unlike other cities, they had the tremors.
[493.64 → 497.00] And they constantly were watching to see if this earthquake would erupt again.
[497.72 → 501.58] And against that backdrop, again, you see the end of this letter where Jesus says to them,
[501.88 → 504.92] my God's going to make you pillars in his temple.
[505.44 → 507.20] You'll never have to leave.
[507.30 → 508.24] Why does he say that?
[508.62 → 511.68] Because this is the city that knows when it's time to run.
[511.68 → 517.94] And when the volcano erupts and God's like, there's a permanence coming for the church in an impermanent world.
[519.74 → 525.36] Thirdly, we need to know that in this city, there's a particular challenge with the Jewish synagogue.
[526.06 → 529.46] In fact, even archaeologists, they've dug up parts of the synagogue and descriptions from the synagogue.
[529.66 → 533.80] It's evident that the Jews at this time in this place, they had a prominent presence.
[533.80 → 539.02] And unlike the other churches, the challenge for them is not the Roman Empire.
[539.44 → 542.48] It's not false teachers like the Nicolai tans within their midst.
[542.58 → 547.32] It's actually dynamics and conflict and hostility from the local synagogue.
[547.64 → 549.16] That's the dynamic of this letter.
[549.80 → 556.72] And so with that lens in mind, we'll be able to hear a little more clearly what Jesus is saying in that context to the church in Philadelphia.
[556.72 → 562.06] So if you've got your Bible in front of you, take a look with me at the opening words that Jesus speaks.
[562.14 → 563.46] Again, a self-introduction.
[564.04 → 564.76] And Jesus says,
[565.18 → 570.48] These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David.
[570.78 → 573.08] What he opens, no one can shut.
[573.16 → 576.26] And what he shuts, no one can open.
[577.54 → 579.86] Now, Jesus makes some significant claims about himself here.
[579.94 → 584.22] In fact, a really literal reading is the one who is holy and the one who is true.
[584.22 → 585.52] And what is that referencing?
[586.72 → 590.30] Who does the Old Testament describe as the true one and the holy one?
[591.30 → 592.12] It's God the Father.
[593.02 → 596.84] Jesus is saying nothing less than, I am God.
[597.40 → 600.24] And again, through the lens of the conflict with the synagogue, he's saying,
[600.60 → 602.62] Church, you've got it right.
[603.30 → 604.94] I am the Son of God.
[605.04 → 607.08] I have the power of God.
[607.18 → 609.26] I am one with the Father.
[610.16 → 612.22] And then he goes on to say, I hold the keys of David.
[612.40 → 614.32] In Revelation 1, we've heard Jesus say,
[614.44 → 616.62] I hold the keys to death and to Hades.
[616.72 → 618.38] And now he's saying, I hold the keys of David.
[618.72 → 622.10] And I love how one writer says when he, you know, that phrase comes from the Old Testament.
[622.24 → 623.78] It comes from the prophecies of Isaiah.
[624.36 → 630.06] And in Isaiah, the house of David, the keys of David, is this rich image to depict that it's the kingdom of God.
[630.52 → 632.30] It's the city of God, the temple of God.
[632.30 → 634.44] And all the riches of God, the king.
[634.82 → 637.88] Jesus is saying, I hold because I have the key of David.
[639.94 → 641.38] But then we get to these phrases.
[641.84 → 643.00] It's actually repeated here.
[643.36 → 646.00] Where Jesus says, the door I open, no one can shut.
[646.06 → 647.66] The door I shut, no one can open.
[647.76 → 651.08] And he says, I have placed before you an open door.
[651.08 → 659.00] And that's saying nothing less than that Jesus, the risen king, has all the authority over salvation and judgment.
[659.34 → 662.46] The open door, the closed door, that's in Jesus' hands.
[663.30 → 664.46] That's a strong statement.
[664.62 → 668.46] And it's basically a statement of him being the source of salvation and judgment.
[668.46 → 676.42] And you need to hear it first as a word of encouragement to this little church that's being persecuted by the synagogue.
[677.00 → 679.56] Because it's an important dialect that's going on there.
[679.62 → 682.56] What's happening in all likelihood is there are Jews who have become Christians.
[683.28 → 684.48] And they've joined the church.
[684.82 → 687.46] And the church is made up mostly of non-Jewish people.
[688.10 → 693.42] And it's looking like the church is actually ministering and witnessing to the synagogue saying,
[693.56 → 696.54] come believe that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Old Testament story.
[696.54 → 698.48] He's the one who brings healing and salvation.
[698.64 → 701.22] The kingdom that the Old Testament promises comes through Jesus.
[702.06 → 703.72] But the response is hostility.
[704.74 → 706.28] The response is persecution.
[707.14 → 709.86] It's likely that many of them were excommunicated from their families.
[710.16 → 712.12] And the door of the synagogue was slammed shut.
[712.20 → 713.66] They're no longer welcome there.
[714.20 → 715.18] That's the response.
[716.54 → 719.42] And for you and I'm sitting today, listening to this passage, we might think,
[719.50 → 720.40] okay, what's with these Jews?
[720.48 → 721.88] Why are they so hostile to the church?
[721.98 → 723.50] I mean, why slam the doors?
[723.62 → 724.32] Why excommunicate?
[724.44 → 725.28] Why the persecution?
[725.28 → 729.64] And I think we're thinking like Western people, not like Jewish people.
[730.60 → 738.24] You have to remember that the news of Jesus and what he accomplished was to their ears crazy.
[739.62 → 744.44] The news of this man who supposedly fulfills the Old Testament story,
[744.52 → 748.76] who supposedly is ushering in the kingdom as a human who gets crucified,
[748.76 → 753.94] and the Christians are saying somehow his death on the cross is what defeated sin,
[754.08 → 756.48] somehow his death on the cross is what defeated Satan,
[756.66 → 759.42] and in his resurrection, that's how the kingdom comes.
[759.50 → 761.12] And the Jews are like, there's just no way.
[761.62 → 762.50] That's crazy.
[762.50 → 769.22] I might add here, it's no less crazy than most Vancouverites think about the gospel.
[769.88 → 772.54] That all of human history, this is what we believe, by the way,
[772.62 → 779.06] all human history hangs on the event of one man in Jerusalem on a cross.
[779.46 → 780.52] That's the Christian story.
[780.60 → 781.52] And the Jews are like, no way.
[782.18 → 783.06] We resist that.
[783.06 → 786.70] And so Jesus encourages them.
[786.74 → 788.36] So I want you to hear how they would hear it then.
[788.48 → 790.82] When Jesus says, the door I open, no one can shut,
[791.00 → 794.78] he's basically saying, you might have had the doors of the synagogue slammed in your face.
[794.86 → 796.10] You can't talk to your family.
[796.20 → 797.18] But guess what, church?
[797.86 → 799.64] I hold the keys.
[800.66 → 804.56] I open the door of salvation, and it's open to you.
[805.56 → 807.56] That's what matters in the end.
[808.04 → 809.72] Not whether the synagogue's door is open,
[809.72 → 812.62] but whether the kingdom door is open through what I have accomplished.
[812.62 → 814.44] And church, it's open.
[815.58 → 820.36] I can only imagine the kind of comfort these statements had for the church in Philadelphia.
[821.04 → 823.58] And I want you to hear it how they would have heard it.
[823.92 → 825.54] These are encouraging words.
[831.38 → 832.62] And if you think about it,
[833.40 → 837.80] the church then is experiencing the same thing that Jesus experienced.
[837.80 → 839.22] When Jesus was announcing the kingdom,
[839.34 → 840.96] he was doing it in the synagogues with Jewish leaders,
[841.02 → 841.54] and he got heat.
[841.66 → 842.36] He got hostility.
[842.62 → 843.82] They chased him out of the cities.
[843.94 → 845.64] And then Jesus goes to the Gentile world,
[845.84 → 847.62] and he starts opening the door of salvation
[847.62 → 850.80] to all the people that the synagogue didn't think belonged there, right?
[851.90 → 854.26] He starts dining with tax collectors and sinners,
[854.40 → 856.58] with people who are not fit for the kingdom,
[856.70 → 857.62] according to the synagogue.
[858.20 → 859.78] He starts announcing forgiveness,
[860.34 → 862.32] and healing, and restoration to the cripple,
[862.44 → 863.50] and the Canaanite woman.
[863.50 → 864.88] And people are looking at him saying,
[865.04 → 866.82] Jesus is opening the door of salvation,
[866.82 → 871.04] and announcing forgiveness to people who don't seem like they deserve it.
[871.54 → 873.68] And Jesus says, this is the kingdom.
[874.72 → 876.96] This was the plan all along.
[877.80 → 878.74] And little church,
[879.62 → 881.84] the door of salvation is open to you
[881.84 → 883.78] by what I have accomplished.
[883.78 → 887.66] And in verse 9,
[887.74 → 890.02] which I think is actually the crux of this whole letter,
[891.70 → 892.38] Jesus is saying,
[892.44 → 893.06] and I'll read it for you.
[893.10 → 893.74] This is verse 9.
[894.06 → 894.78] Jesus says to the church,
[894.86 → 897.22] I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan.
[897.48 → 898.14] And I'll pause there.
[898.20 → 899.36] Remember what I said a few weeks,
[899.42 → 900.50] actually more than once now.
[900.88 → 902.42] When Jesus references Satan,
[903.06 → 904.14] in the book of Revelation,
[904.46 → 906.14] actually John and his prophetic word of it,
[906.44 → 909.24] it's often referencing the way that persecution comes to the church.
[909.24 → 910.70] And it comes through a variety of ways.
[910.78 → 911.66] It comes through the Roman power.
[911.80 → 912.54] It comes through false worship.
[912.60 → 913.14] And now he's saying,
[913.46 → 915.44] those in the synagogue of Satan who are persecuting you,
[915.60 → 916.78] that's the work of Satan,
[917.22 → 919.40] operating through institutions against the church.
[920.16 → 920.62] But then he says,
[920.72 → 921.86] those who claim to be Jews,
[921.94 → 922.80] though they are not,
[922.88 → 923.80] but are liars,
[924.12 → 926.62] I will make them come and fall down at your feet
[926.62 → 930.38] and acknowledge that I have loved you.
[931.94 → 933.12] This is going to come a time
[933.12 → 935.62] where those persecuting the church
[935.62 → 938.92] will know that they've persecuted Jesus' church.
[938.92 → 942.40] And the Jesus that they will see
[942.40 → 944.84] is the resurrected king of all creation.
[946.24 → 947.36] Or as Philippians says,
[947.78 → 948.92] every knee will bow
[948.92 → 950.78] and every tongue will confess
[950.78 → 952.66] that Jesus Christ is Lord
[952.66 → 954.18] to the glory of the Father.
[955.50 → 956.88] And I want you to notice, by the way,
[956.92 → 958.22] there's an irony in this passage.
[958.32 → 959.82] I mean a deep irony.
[960.54 → 962.06] And I say that because in the Old Testament,
[962.14 → 963.62] if you look at how Israel started,
[964.14 → 965.24] you know in Genesis 3 to 11,
[965.34 → 968.24] you have this sin sort of running throughout the world,
[968.24 → 969.32] creating all sorts of havoc.
[969.44 → 970.42] And then in Genesis 12,
[970.56 → 971.56] God calls Abraham.
[972.20 → 974.20] And that's the person through whom he builds Israel.
[974.28 → 976.34] He says, Abraham, I'm calling you.
[977.08 → 978.20] I'm going to bless you.
[978.54 → 979.98] I'm going to make your name great.
[980.08 → 981.22] I'm going to make you a great nation.
[981.30 → 982.94] And what's the final climactic promise?
[984.60 → 987.32] All the nations of the earth
[987.32 → 989.06] will be blessed through you.
[989.20 → 990.24] From the very beginning,
[990.36 → 991.80] even before Israel existed,
[992.02 → 992.74] God made the promise
[992.74 → 995.28] that this people would be a missionary nation
[995.28 → 997.54] and that the nations would be gathered in.
[998.20 → 1000.52] The goal was not just one ethnic people of God.
[1000.60 → 1002.42] The goal was a multi-ethnic,
[1002.72 → 1005.00] global community of faith.
[1005.94 → 1006.96] And that's happening.
[1007.72 → 1009.04] The gospel is going to Pergamum
[1009.04 → 1010.30] and Ephesus and Theatre
[1010.30 → 1011.48] and now it's going to Philadelphia.
[1011.86 → 1013.22] All sorts of people who were not Jewish
[1013.22 → 1014.10] are coming to believe
[1014.10 → 1016.16] and now they're sharing the gospel
[1016.16 → 1017.40] with the synagogue.
[1017.98 → 1018.72] Do you see the irony?
[1019.38 → 1020.34] They are fulfilling
[1020.34 → 1022.28] what the Old Testament was prophesying
[1022.28 → 1024.24] and what the goal of God
[1024.24 → 1026.10] in calling Israel was from the beginning
[1026.10 → 1027.54] in their very existence.
[1027.72 → 1028.88] And they're saying to the synagogue,
[1029.34 → 1030.42] join us.
[1031.18 → 1033.08] Believe that Jesus is the Messiah.
[1035.42 → 1037.12] Now this image of the open door
[1037.12 → 1038.78] I actually think runs deeper
[1038.78 → 1042.08] even than just Jesus being the source of salvation
[1042.08 → 1044.58] and the one who offers salvation
[1044.58 → 1045.98] to anyone who believes in Him.
[1046.46 → 1048.00] I believe it has to do also
[1048.00 → 1050.56] with witnessing the salvation.
[1050.56 → 1052.04] And maybe you know this,
[1052.10 → 1052.46] maybe you don't,
[1052.52 → 1053.76] but the second you become a Christian
[1053.76 → 1055.28] you join a mission.
[1056.22 → 1058.14] It's not as though you become a Christian,
[1058.36 → 1059.32] you go through some learning,
[1059.52 → 1060.76] some discipleship,
[1060.90 → 1062.18] and years down the road
[1062.18 → 1063.28] you start witnessing
[1063.28 → 1064.22] and sharing the gospel.
[1064.60 → 1065.42] To join the church
[1065.42 → 1067.92] is to join a missionary community.
[1068.02 → 1068.58] Did you know that?
[1069.94 → 1071.36] To be in the church
[1071.36 → 1072.64] is to be in a church
[1072.64 → 1074.34] that witnesses to the reign of Jesus
[1074.34 → 1076.84] in life, in word, in deed.
[1077.76 → 1078.90] To be in the church
[1078.90 → 1079.76] is to be sent.
[1079.76 → 1080.88] I'm beating a dead horse now.
[1080.90 → 1081.48] You get the point.
[1082.84 → 1085.78] And when Paul talks about open doors,
[1086.00 → 1086.98] how does he talk?
[1088.14 → 1089.58] He talks about mission.
[1090.36 → 1091.94] In his letters to the churches in Philippians
[1091.94 → 1093.02] and Colossians and Corinthians,
[1093.16 → 1093.34] he says,
[1093.48 → 1095.78] Pray for me that there would be an open door
[1095.78 → 1096.66] to share the gospel.
[1097.26 → 1099.28] Open doors is not just that salvation is there,
[1099.36 → 1100.80] but that Paul gets to tell people
[1100.80 → 1101.70] and invite people
[1101.70 → 1103.38] to walk through those doors
[1103.38 → 1104.62] in these various cities.
[1104.62 → 1107.70] And I think the most striking passage of Paul's
[1107.70 → 1109.96] about mission and open doors of salvation
[1109.96 → 1111.84] comes in Corinthians 16.
[1113.16 → 1114.48] And what's striking to me here
[1114.48 → 1117.52] is how the opportunity in the open doors is there,
[1117.66 → 1119.44] but that doesn't mean it will be easy doors.
[1119.56 → 1120.00] And I want you to,
[1120.06 → 1121.04] I think I have it up on the screen.
[1121.14 → 1123.38] This is Paul in 1 Corinthians 16, verse 9.
[1124.04 → 1124.54] He writes,
[1124.64 → 1127.18] A great door for effective work
[1127.18 → 1128.14] has been opened to me.
[1128.42 → 1129.20] Doesn't that sound amazing?
[1129.46 → 1130.40] It's going to share the gospel,
[1130.52 → 1131.30] people are going to respond.
[1131.30 → 1132.64] What's the next line?
[1133.36 → 1135.86] And there are many who oppose me.
[1137.02 → 1138.34] You know what I hear when I read that?
[1139.46 → 1140.86] That God's going to work,
[1140.98 → 1141.72] people are going to come
[1141.72 → 1142.52] and hear the gospel
[1142.52 → 1143.72] and receive it in faith,
[1144.00 → 1145.84] but there will be opposition.
[1147.04 → 1148.68] And that Jesus is sending his church
[1148.68 → 1149.62] to all these cities
[1149.62 → 1150.72] where the door is open,
[1151.34 → 1152.58] but it won't be easy.
[1153.44 → 1155.30] He's sending believers to Theatre,
[1155.82 → 1157.08] where there's people from the city
[1157.08 → 1158.28] trying to divide the church
[1158.28 → 1158.98] with false teaching.
[1158.98 → 1161.54] He's sending people to Philadelphia
[1161.54 → 1163.66] where the synagogue is slamming the door
[1163.66 → 1164.66] in the faces of believers.
[1164.86 → 1166.42] He's sending believers to Pergamum
[1166.42 → 1168.48] where people are martyred for their faith.
[1169.26 → 1170.60] And in each of these cities,
[1170.96 → 1173.68] they are sent to tell people
[1173.68 → 1175.14] about the open door of salvation,
[1175.24 → 1176.24] that they have found,
[1176.44 → 1177.58] that has changed their lives,
[1177.64 → 1178.56] and then invite them
[1178.56 → 1179.62] to walk through those doors.
[1180.76 → 1184.56] And remember that this is a city
[1184.56 → 1187.16] that was built as an open door.
[1187.24 → 1188.52] I happen to agree with the writers
[1188.52 → 1189.62] who say when Jesus is talking
[1189.62 → 1190.22] about the open door,
[1190.44 → 1192.42] he's talking about the city itself,
[1192.80 → 1194.32] which was built and developed
[1194.32 → 1195.74] so that the Greek world
[1195.74 → 1196.82] would go further,
[1197.30 → 1198.38] so that people would understand
[1198.38 → 1198.92] Greek culture
[1198.92 → 1199.82] and they'd become part
[1199.82 → 1200.52] of the Greek empire.
[1200.90 → 1201.58] And Jesus is saying
[1201.58 → 1202.64] to the church of Philadelphia,
[1202.96 → 1203.84] the open door is that
[1203.84 → 1205.76] the gospel moves through this city
[1205.76 → 1207.52] to the neighbouring nations,
[1207.70 → 1208.84] and people hear the good news.
[1210.30 → 1211.30] Let me read for you
[1211.30 → 1212.34] what my former professor,
[1212.46 → 1212.98] Daryl Johnson,
[1213.10 → 1215.02] writes about the city of Philadelphia
[1215.02 → 1217.08] in regard to it being an open door.
[1217.08 → 1218.28] He writes,
[1219.06 → 1221.26] Philadelphia was the ideal
[1221.26 → 1222.80] of the seven cities for this base,
[1222.88 → 1223.98] that is to share the gospel.
[1224.50 → 1226.74] It was located on one of the greatest highways
[1226.74 → 1227.38] in the world,
[1227.50 → 1228.18] the highway that led
[1228.18 → 1229.18] from Europe to the east.
[1229.58 → 1231.40] It was one of the most strategic cities
[1231.40 → 1232.76] of the ancient world.
[1233.10 → 1233.86] And he quotes Jesus,
[1234.08 → 1237.38] look, an open door of opportunity.
[1240.46 → 1241.86] Daryl Johnson actually goes further
[1241.86 → 1243.70] in his writing on Revelation.
[1243.70 → 1244.32] He says,
[1244.98 → 1246.92] Is Jesus not making the same claim
[1246.92 → 1248.90] about our cities?
[1250.14 → 1251.84] Does Jesus not see
[1251.84 → 1253.84] our own place
[1253.84 → 1256.20] as an open door of opportunity,
[1256.82 → 1259.24] even though it may be hard
[1259.24 → 1260.28] in its own right?
[1261.60 → 1262.86] Could this not be
[1262.86 → 1264.24] our strategic location,
[1264.34 → 1265.80] just like the church in Philadelphia,
[1266.22 → 1267.46] for bearing witness
[1267.46 → 1268.28] to the reign of Jesus,
[1268.38 → 1268.92] even here,
[1269.42 → 1270.22] post-Christian,
[1270.36 → 1271.64] West Coast British Columbia?
[1271.64 → 1275.30] A few years ago,
[1275.36 → 1276.98] I got to hear a preacher
[1276.98 → 1278.90] and a pastor named Lao Peri.
[1279.52 → 1280.86] He grew up in Ghana,
[1281.26 → 1282.10] and then he moved to Quebec,
[1282.28 → 1283.38] and he realized that BC is better,
[1283.46 → 1284.26] so he moved to BC.
[1284.82 → 1285.70] No offence to Quebec.
[1286.70 → 1288.18] And then he basically got involved
[1288.18 → 1289.34] in international student ministry,
[1289.44 → 1290.08] and at one point,
[1290.14 → 1291.02] he preached at the church
[1291.02 → 1291.68] I was part of,
[1291.90 → 1292.86] and he shared some things
[1292.86 → 1293.32] about Canada
[1293.32 → 1294.74] that I just did not understand.
[1295.32 → 1296.96] And one of the main things he said is,
[1297.06 → 1298.42] if you live in the West Coast,
[1298.60 → 1300.40] you do not need to go anywhere
[1300.40 → 1301.88] in the world for missions work.
[1303.06 → 1303.36] I was like,
[1303.38 → 1303.96] well, why is that?
[1304.02 → 1304.34] And he said,
[1304.40 → 1305.52] because the world is coming
[1305.52 → 1306.32] to your city.
[1307.58 → 1308.52] I'm sure many of you realize
[1308.52 → 1309.40] that the world is coming
[1309.40 → 1310.04] to our city.
[1310.08 → 1310.84] And this is some of the stuff
[1310.84 → 1311.44] he rattled off.
[1311.64 → 1313.22] The numbers are probably higher now.
[1313.54 → 1313.86] He said,
[1313.90 → 1314.74] did you know that there are
[1314.74 → 1316.42] 300,000 plus immigrants
[1316.42 → 1317.60] that come to our cities
[1317.60 → 1318.42] every year?
[1318.92 → 1320.74] 200,000 international students
[1320.74 → 1321.88] from all over the world
[1321.88 → 1323.08] that come to our cities
[1323.08 → 1323.62] every year.
[1323.94 → 1325.86] 25,000 plus refugees
[1325.86 → 1326.76] that come to our cities
[1326.76 → 1328.06] in a non-COVID year.
[1328.06 → 1331.88] 500,000 temporary workers
[1331.88 → 1332.78] from all over the world
[1332.78 → 1333.64] coming to our cities
[1333.64 → 1334.18] every year.
[1334.26 → 1334.58] And he says,
[1334.82 → 1336.02] what are the opportunities
[1336.02 → 1336.82] here, church,
[1337.42 → 1338.24] in our country?
[1338.28 → 1338.60] And he said,
[1338.64 → 1339.64] just on an estimate,
[1339.78 → 1340.76] he thinks that in Toronto
[1340.76 → 1341.40] and Vancouver,
[1341.78 → 1342.88] when Christians gather
[1342.88 → 1343.38] for worship,
[1343.54 → 1346.08] there's over 130 languages
[1346.08 → 1347.30] worshipped in.
[1348.32 → 1349.66] The world has come
[1349.66 → 1351.04] to our city.
[1352.28 → 1354.28] What an open door.
[1354.28 → 1356.36] And I happen to know
[1356.36 → 1357.16] that most Christians,
[1357.28 → 1358.30] and this includes our church
[1358.30 → 1358.96] in the West,
[1359.04 → 1360.20] feel like we're pretty small.
[1361.08 → 1361.28] You know,
[1361.30 → 1362.00] we're not like maybe
[1362.00 → 1362.78] the American church
[1362.78 → 1363.80] that has a lot more people,
[1363.90 → 1364.92] a lot more political power.
[1365.04 → 1365.92] We know that we're outside
[1365.92 → 1367.28] of the centre of cultural life,
[1367.32 → 1368.26] and I think that's for the better.
[1368.54 → 1369.94] But we feel our smallness.
[1370.78 → 1372.06] And Dr. Lao Peri even says,
[1372.16 → 1372.70] could it not be
[1372.70 → 1374.00] that God's bringing believers
[1374.00 → 1375.18] from all over the world
[1375.18 → 1376.28] to strengthen you,
[1376.42 → 1377.28] and that they're going to be
[1377.28 → 1378.14] one of the strengths
[1378.14 → 1378.94] that you'll need
[1378.94 → 1380.42] to do effective witness?
[1381.22 → 1382.36] Which is just one of the reasons,
[1382.46 → 1382.88] by the way,
[1382.88 → 1383.94] that I pray that God
[1383.94 → 1384.90] continues to deepen
[1384.90 → 1385.56] and develop
[1385.56 → 1386.44] and make our church
[1386.44 → 1387.64] multi-ethnic.
[1389.92 → 1391.06] But let's talk for a moment
[1391.06 → 1391.90] about our smallness.
[1393.12 → 1394.22] I want to read another quote.
[1394.30 → 1394.82] It comes from a man
[1394.82 → 1395.58] named Robert Bella.
[1395.70 → 1397.00] He's at the University of California,
[1397.00 → 1397.82] and he's talking about
[1397.82 → 1398.54] mission in Japan.
[1398.88 → 1399.96] And I won't get into
[1399.96 → 1400.72] the great detail of that,
[1400.78 → 1401.70] but Japan is also
[1401.70 → 1403.44] a very non-Christian country.
[1404.08 → 1405.18] And I've heard from people
[1405.18 → 1405.90] that Japan might be
[1405.90 → 1406.92] one of the hardest countries
[1406.92 → 1407.86] to be a missionary in.
[1407.96 → 1408.68] I don't know if that's true,
[1408.76 → 1409.72] but I've heard it from people.
[1410.36 → 1410.88] And this professor,
[1411.68 → 1412.40] I think I have the quote
[1412.40 → 1413.14] on the screen here too,
[1413.20 → 1414.84] he shares about how he's seen
[1414.84 → 1415.92] the influence of Christianity,
[1416.04 → 1417.34] a small group of Christianity
[1417.34 → 1418.66] in Japan.
[1418.82 → 1419.20] He writes,
[1419.30 → 1420.62] we should not underestimate
[1420.62 → 1421.86] the significance
[1421.86 → 1423.38] of a small group of people
[1423.38 → 1424.52] who have a vision
[1424.52 → 1426.62] of a just and gentle world.
[1427.38 → 1428.10] In Japan,
[1428.22 → 1429.36] a very small minority
[1429.36 → 1429.92] of Christians
[1429.92 → 1431.00] introduced ethics
[1431.00 → 1431.70] into politics
[1431.70 → 1432.64] and had an impact
[1432.64 → 1433.96] beyond their proportion
[1433.96 → 1434.60] of numbers.
[1435.46 → 1436.20] They were central
[1436.20 → 1436.66] in the beginning
[1436.66 → 1437.56] of the women's movement,
[1437.74 → 1438.28] labour unions,
[1438.36 → 1439.42] and virtually every
[1439.42 → 1440.32] reform movement.
[1440.32 → 1441.94] the quality
[1441.94 → 1442.88] of a culture
[1442.88 → 1444.00] may be changed
[1444.00 → 1445.86] when just 2%
[1445.86 → 1447.68] of its people
[1447.68 → 1449.50] have a new vision,
[1449.64 → 1450.32] and I would add
[1450.32 → 1452.38] kingdom vision.
[1453.86 → 1455.40] Does that not encourage you,
[1455.46 → 1455.64] Hope?
[1458.28 → 1459.30] Just one of us?
[1459.38 → 1459.56] Okay.
[1459.56 → 1465.20] The church in every city
[1465.20 → 1467.02] is sent
[1467.02 → 1469.08] to bear witness
[1469.08 → 1470.04] to the open door.
[1470.76 → 1472.12] The door that changed
[1472.12 → 1473.08] our lives,
[1473.16 → 1473.62] by the way.
[1474.22 → 1474.74] This is the door
[1474.74 → 1475.68] that showed us
[1475.68 → 1476.22] who we are,
[1476.30 → 1477.14] it showed us reality,
[1477.24 → 1478.08] it showed us that life
[1478.08 → 1479.76] is found in Jesus,
[1479.94 → 1480.90] and the church is sent
[1480.90 → 1482.22] to bear witness
[1482.22 → 1483.04] to that open door.
[1483.12 → 1483.90] And Jesus finishes
[1483.90 → 1484.42] our letter
[1484.42 → 1485.62] with just encouragement
[1485.62 → 1486.12] and hope.
[1486.12 → 1486.46] He says,
[1486.60 → 1487.40] I'm coming soon,
[1487.56 → 1487.82] church.
[1488.02 → 1489.30] Hold on to what you have.
[1489.68 → 1490.20] And you should know
[1490.20 → 1491.06] that when Jesus says
[1491.06 → 1491.90] to some of the churches
[1491.90 → 1492.44] in Asia Minor
[1492.44 → 1493.26] when he's coming soon,
[1493.42 → 1494.60] that's actually a warning.
[1495.12 → 1496.04] They've got to wake up.
[1496.56 → 1498.06] They've got to become faithful
[1498.06 → 1499.06] in what their calling is.
[1499.12 → 1499.76] But to this church
[1499.76 → 1500.36] in Philadelphia,
[1500.80 → 1501.60] it's encouragement.
[1502.36 → 1503.42] I'm coming soon, church,
[1503.86 → 1505.28] and you will be vindicated.
[1506.58 → 1507.84] I'm coming soon, church,
[1508.02 → 1509.34] and you will receive a crown.
[1510.52 → 1511.84] I'm coming soon, church,
[1512.02 → 1512.78] and God,
[1512.92 → 1513.84] to those who are victorious,
[1513.84 → 1515.06] will make pillars
[1515.06 → 1516.18] in his temple.
[1516.66 → 1517.66] Isn't that a rich image?
[1518.02 → 1518.64] God's going to make
[1518.64 → 1519.24] the faithful
[1519.24 → 1520.28] who stick with him
[1520.28 → 1520.82] and are faithful
[1520.82 → 1521.28] to the gospel
[1521.28 → 1523.06] pillars in his temple.
[1524.12 → 1524.86] And when he says that,
[1524.90 → 1525.20] by the way,
[1525.20 → 1525.74] he's not talking
[1525.74 → 1526.56] about a physical temple
[1526.56 → 1527.66] because what is God
[1527.66 → 1528.72] bringing in this passage?
[1529.40 → 1530.32] It's the new Jerusalem.
[1530.90 → 1532.44] It's the renewed creation.
[1533.14 → 1533.84] And the temples
[1533.84 → 1534.88] will simply be people
[1534.88 → 1536.22] living in this world
[1536.22 → 1537.70] in the full presence
[1537.70 → 1539.20] of our living God.
[1540.10 → 1541.20] That's the future hope
[1541.20 → 1541.70] God gives
[1541.70 → 1542.90] to the Philadelphian church.
[1542.90 → 1544.46] And until then,
[1545.26 → 1546.60] they bear witness
[1546.60 → 1547.36] to the open door.
[1548.56 → 1549.22] Until then,
[1549.28 → 1551.66] they love the city to life.
[1552.34 → 1554.12] They persevere in the gospel.
[1554.56 → 1555.32] They bear witness
[1555.32 → 1556.76] to the loving rule of Jesus.
[1557.24 → 1558.30] And they point
[1558.30 → 1560.64] to the open doors
[1560.64 → 1561.86] of salvation.
[1562.94 → 1563.88] And I think
[1563.88 → 1565.70] a lot of that
[1565.70 → 1567.38] is telling our story.
[1567.38 → 1569.88] why in the world
[1569.88 → 1571.34] we found ourselves
[1571.34 → 1572.86] walking through those doors,
[1573.32 → 1574.14] following the voice
[1574.14 → 1574.60] of Jesus
[1574.60 → 1575.22] through community,
[1575.40 → 1576.06] following the voice
[1576.06 → 1576.42] of Jesus,
[1576.54 → 1577.36] working in our hearts
[1577.36 → 1579.22] into salvation,
[1580.32 → 1581.60] sharing our story
[1581.60 → 1583.80] that Jesus holds the keys.
[1584.82 → 1586.00] Jesus is salvation.
[1586.66 → 1587.74] And Jesus is coming
[1587.74 → 1590.00] to restore all things.
[1590.74 → 1591.46] Let's pray.
[1595.30 → 1596.84] Father, we thank you so much
[1596.84 → 1597.46] for these letters.
[1598.86 → 1600.02] And we pray that you would
[1600.02 → 1601.00] give us the ears
[1601.00 → 1602.34] to hear what it means
[1602.34 → 1602.36] to hear what it means.
