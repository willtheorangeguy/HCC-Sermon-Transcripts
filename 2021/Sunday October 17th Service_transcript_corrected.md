[0.00 → 2.66] The second I sat down, my wife pointed out to me, she says,
[2.78 → 7.50] you didn't even say to people that the banners that we have in our building are designed and created by Abby.
[7.66 → 10.30] So yes, every Sunday, Abby blesses us.
[11.00 → 11.26] Yes.
[17.16 → 20.08] Well, we're going to continue our series in servanthood this week.
[20.18 → 25.06] We've been looking at how, so far, Jesus is our model of servanthood as he washes his disciples' feet.
[25.60 → 28.48] We've looked at how we're called with our gifts to build of the body of Christ.
[29.48 → 33.02] We've looked at how we're called to use our resources and serve in generosity.
[33.82 → 37.34] And for the next few weeks, we're looking at different spaces that we are called to serve in.
[37.44 → 39.56] And so we're going to look at our homes, we're looking at our city, our neighbourhoods,
[39.56 → 41.56] and also this morning, we're going to look at our work.
[41.82 → 43.74] So it's fitting that we interviewed Abby this morning.
[44.40 → 48.64] And so if you have your Bible on your phone, or you have a physical Bible, turn with me to Ephesians 6,
[49.10 → 51.50] and we will read a passage on work there.
[58.48 → 59.48] Slaves.
[59.48 → 60.48] Slaves.
[60.48 → 61.20] Slaves.
[61.20 → 61.24] Slaves.
[61.24 → 61.28] Slaves.
[61.28 → 61.32] Slaves.
[61.32 → 61.36] Slaves.
[61.36 → 61.40] Slaves.
[61.40 → 62.40] Slaves.
[62.40 → 66.66] Obey your earthly masters with respect and fear and with sincerity of heart,
[66.66 → 68.72] just as you would obey Christ.
[69.72 → 73.08] Obey not only to win their favour when their eye is on you,
[73.70 → 76.98] but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.
[76.98 → 77.02] Slaves.
[77.94 → 83.30] Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people,
[83.78 → 87.76] because you know that the Lord will reward each one of you for whatever good you do,
[88.24 → 89.78] whether you are slave or free.
[90.92 → 94.22] And masters, treat your slaves in the same way.
[94.94 → 99.18] Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their master and yours in heaven,
[99.76 → 102.42] and there is no favouritism with him.
[106.98 → 111.16] Well, when Brittany and I first moved to Ontario, from Ontario to BC,
[111.68 → 114.76] a number of years ago, we had this practice sometimes of visiting her grandmother,
[115.20 → 118.14] who at that time was staying at Manor Manor, which is just in Langley City.
[118.76 → 122.20] And I always loved visiting Brittany's grandmother because she had dementia
[122.20 → 125.66] and could never remember my name, and so Brittany had to reintroduce me every time.
[125.94 → 127.12] And this is how Brittany would do it.
[127.16 → 127.82] She remembers this.
[127.92 → 129.94] She would say, Grandma, this is Dave.
[130.44 → 131.50] He's a pastor.
[131.50 → 135.54] And her grandmother was a missionary, a godly woman,
[135.68 → 139.58] but something about Brittany saying every time I was a pastor just warmed her right up.
[139.64 → 141.60] She would clasp her hands together, and she'd be like,
[141.70 → 143.10] Oh, a pastor.
[144.38 → 145.46] That's wonderful.
[146.02 → 148.04] You know, she was so excited about being a pastor.
[148.36 → 151.24] And I love that because, you know, most people don't give me that reaction.
[151.44 → 152.24] It's just Brittany's grandma.
[152.86 → 155.22] Most people, like, as someone said to me just a few months ago,
[155.34 → 156.56] That's like a real job?
[156.78 → 157.60] People pay for that?
[157.60 → 162.66] And as much as I love that she loved that I was a pastor,
[162.94 → 165.82] there's something about that perspective that has never sat well with me.
[166.54 → 169.06] And she grew up, Brittany's grandma grew up with a context,
[169.16 → 170.56] and maybe some of you have been shaped by this too,
[170.62 → 174.00] where there's this unspoken hierarchy of work, right?
[174.38 → 176.52] There's the spiritual jobs up here,
[176.68 → 179.92] and there's the sort of secular jobs down here, right?
[179.98 → 180.94] And what are the spiritual jobs?
[181.04 → 181.90] Pastors, what else?
[183.28 → 187.18] Missionaries, Bible translators, stuff of that sort.
[187.60 → 190.02] Then you sort of go down, things are getting a little more secular.
[190.22 → 193.98] You've got, like, you know, farmers, people do essential services, nurses, doctors.
[194.88 → 196.98] And then at the bottom, you have, like, the super secular jobs.
[197.06 → 198.64] What are the super secular jobs?
[200.18 → 200.74] Care aid.
[200.98 → 203.50] Oh, I would have put that a little higher, but that's okay.
[204.64 → 204.96] Lawyers.
[205.20 → 205.50] That's right.
[206.80 → 209.34] We had two people yell that out at the 9 a.m. service,
[209.46 → 211.34] one of whom was an ICBC lawyer.
[211.34 → 214.58] I feel like that's just a, hmm, you know.
[214.58 → 218.22] That laughter was a bit too real, too close to home.
[219.54 → 221.92] Still a brother in the church, servant of the Lord.
[222.44 → 224.46] But this is dynamic that's real,
[224.54 → 227.58] and oftentimes we can unknowingly prioritize
[227.58 → 230.34] or, like, lift positions that are, quote-unquote, spiritual
[230.34 → 233.34] and also demean and belittle positions
[233.34 → 236.40] that Christ cares deeply for in every sphere of life.
[237.12 → 239.82] And, of course, we should know, and I'll reiterate this morning,
[239.82 → 244.44] that the goal when you become a Christian is not to quit your, quote-unquote, secular job
[244.44 → 246.60] and go to some, quote-unquote, spiritual job.
[246.96 → 248.72] I mean, what a mess our world would be
[248.72 → 251.62] if Abby, when she became a Christian, quit her job
[251.62 → 253.14] and became a pastor or a missionary.
[254.10 → 255.46] You know, as I put it in the 9 a.m. service,
[255.56 → 257.44] we baptized Tony and Carrie Ann's kids,
[258.22 → 259.54] and Tony is a firefighter.
[259.86 → 261.98] And I just thought to myself, if someone's house was on fire,
[262.50 → 263.98] they better not be calling a pastor.
[264.54 → 265.62] They better be calling Tony.
[266.18 → 267.42] Because we need Tony.
[267.42 → 269.70] We need firefighters in our world to put out those fires.
[269.82 → 272.06] And if it's all up to pastors and missionaries, we're in trouble.
[273.28 → 275.46] We are sent with all of our different gifts,
[276.26 → 277.56] all of our different abilities,
[277.96 → 280.58] into every sphere of life, right?
[280.70 → 284.56] From farming to architecture to business to graphic design to serve Jesus.
[285.52 → 287.08] And if you've been around Hope long enough,
[287.14 → 288.96] you'll know that a deep desire of ours
[288.96 → 293.66] is to continually re-narrate our work in light of the biblical story.
[294.46 → 296.80] And we realize that week after week, day after day,
[296.80 → 300.94] we are discipled and narrated into the wrong story about our work.
[301.44 → 302.94] A story that says you work for the weekend.
[303.86 → 305.30] A story that says you work for you.
[305.84 → 309.44] The goal of your work is for you to have status or money or reputation or whatever,
[309.70 → 312.36] but not a story that shapes work around servanthood.
[313.20 → 314.84] Using your gifts for the sake of the other.
[315.22 → 318.34] Giving yourself a way to wash the feet of the world through your work.
[318.86 → 319.76] That's our story.
[321.04 → 324.10] Dorothy Sayers, who's written some pretty deep stuff and profound stuff on work,
[324.10 → 325.66] she says, what good is religion?
[326.30 → 330.48] What good is religion if it has nothing to say and no concern for
[330.48 → 332.48] the thing you spend most of your life doing?
[333.10 → 333.62] It's work.
[334.56 → 335.84] I think this is an insightful point.
[335.94 → 337.96] What good is Christianity if it has nothing to say
[337.96 → 340.76] for the thing you spend exponentially more time doing
[340.76 → 342.84] than volunteering at a church, right?
[342.84 → 348.22] And I'll reiterate this again, but Christ has gifted the church,
[348.64 → 350.60] as we've talked about, not just to build up the body,
[351.14 → 355.28] but to build up the city with all the gifts and all the spaces
[355.28 → 358.64] and dimensions of life to use what we've been given
[358.64 → 362.78] to bless the world, wash the feet of the world through our work.
[363.56 → 365.42] And I'll say this twice, and if you're a journaled,
[365.56 → 367.06] some of our middle school journals,
[367.10 → 368.18] you probably want to write this one down,
[368.18 → 372.18] but our workplaces are likely going to be the primary places
[372.18 → 375.40] where you use your gifts to love and serve your neighbour
[375.40 → 377.02] and bear witness to the reign of Jesus.
[377.50 → 378.14] I'll say that again.
[378.22 → 382.00] Your workplace is likely to be the primary place
[382.00 → 385.98] where you will use your gifts to serve and love your neighbour
[385.98 → 388.06] and bear witness to the reign of Jesus.
[389.26 → 391.34] And I don't know about you, but sometimes I think,
[391.44 → 393.08] do we really believe that in the church?
[393.42 → 395.76] Do we see Monday morning as sacred as Sunday morning?
[395.76 → 397.92] Do we see what we do here as gathering and equipping
[397.92 → 400.56] so that we can serve in our workspaces tomorrow morning?
[400.60 → 401.18] I'm not sure.
[402.60 → 405.76] But we need to remember, especially this morning,
[406.06 → 408.62] how Christ sends us into the city
[408.62 → 411.38] to wash the feet of the world through our work.
[412.72 → 416.24] Now, our passage this morning has so much to teach us about work,
[416.60 → 418.00] but I have to admit to you at the outset,
[418.10 → 419.70] our passage is, I think, in my mind,
[419.74 → 421.02] is sort of shrouded with thorns
[421.02 → 423.74] because who is Paul speaking to in Ephesians 6?
[426.48 → 426.84] Slaves.
[427.52 → 429.14] And maybe some of you who are new to the church
[429.14 → 430.12] or you're new to our church,
[430.20 → 431.10] you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[431.52 → 433.40] The pastor here is preaching on the very thing
[433.40 → 434.54] that I left the church for.
[434.74 → 437.16] Like, I don't believe that religion should be endorsing slavery
[437.16 → 438.82] and what's the deal with Paul addressing slaves?
[439.26 → 441.34] And so what I want to do is just give a few minutes
[441.34 → 443.68] to what Paul is saying to slaves
[443.68 → 446.58] because we need to see how the scriptures are good news,
[446.98 → 449.48] even for this people stuck in this institution of slavery.
[449.66 → 450.80] And then we'll work out together
[450.80 → 452.58] how this passage speaks powerfully
[452.58 → 453.82] into the reason we do our work,
[454.06 → 456.52] the story for our work, who we work for, okay?
[456.60 → 457.22] That's what we're going to do.
[457.26 → 457.76] That's our roadmap.
[458.56 → 459.16] So slavery.
[460.78 → 461.74] Let's talk about it.
[462.48 → 465.22] Paul addresses in this church families, households.
[465.32 → 465.98] In all of his letters,
[466.06 → 468.10] you'll see he actually addresses three groups of people,
[468.94 → 470.60] husbands and wives, parents and children,
[470.78 → 471.82] and slaves and masters.
[471.92 → 472.82] And you know why that is?
[473.50 → 475.04] Because they all live together in homes.
[475.48 → 476.66] And by the way, churches didn't gather
[476.66 → 478.20] in buildings like this in the first century.
[478.26 → 479.08] They gathered in homes.
[479.08 → 480.98] And in homes were husbands and wives,
[481.12 → 483.10] parents and children, slaves and masters.
[483.54 → 485.64] That was just how they're all worked out.
[485.76 → 488.34] The home was sort of an extended clan of people
[488.34 → 489.68] that worked together.
[490.16 → 491.98] And every home had slaves.
[492.96 → 494.48] In fact, do you know the percentage of slaves
[494.48 → 495.84] in the Roman Empire in the first century?
[496.18 → 497.48] Any guesses how many slaves there were?
[497.54 → 498.56] What percentage of the Roman Empire?
[500.52 → 501.72] We had a middle schooler
[501.72 → 503.92] who gave almost a perfect guess in the 9 a.m. service.
[505.78 → 506.14] 60%.
[506.14 → 506.88] Oh, that's a little high.
[507.18 → 508.26] You should talk to the middle schooler.
[509.08 → 509.64] 30%.
[509.64 → 514.38] 30% of the Roman Empire comprised slaves.
[514.66 → 516.22] To put that into Canadian terms,
[516.32 → 517.54] if our population is 36 million,
[517.64 → 519.52] that's roughly 12 million Canadians
[519.52 → 521.24] would buy comparison be slaves.
[521.44 → 522.22] That's a lot.
[523.32 → 525.30] And Paul, just like so many people in his day,
[525.38 → 528.12] couldn't even imagine the Roman Empire without slavery.
[528.20 → 528.96] It was like, you know,
[529.00 → 530.62] us imagining a world without electricity.
[530.80 → 533.00] It's so foundational to the Roman society,
[533.82 → 534.76] the way it was,
[535.32 → 536.46] that slaves were everywhere.
[536.46 → 537.86] That was part of everyone's home.
[537.86 → 539.82] And so you should know,
[539.98 → 541.50] I should, just a few words about slavery.
[541.80 → 542.58] It's not like,
[542.88 → 543.98] it's not much better,
[544.32 → 546.38] but it's not like the way we think of American slavery
[546.38 → 547.12] in, you know,
[547.20 → 548.52] the 18th, 19th, 20th century.
[548.76 → 549.96] It's not built on race.
[550.42 → 551.46] It's not built on kidnapping.
[552.38 → 553.28] Slaves had money.
[553.48 → 554.08] Slaves had power.
[554.20 → 555.32] Slaves often had their own slaves.
[555.38 → 556.00] They had property.
[556.50 → 557.88] They could move around the city.
[558.04 → 559.46] They had a lot of different positions.
[559.54 → 560.86] It was a nuanced institution.
[560.86 → 562.58] But none of this makes it good.
[562.70 → 564.22] And Paul is in no way ever,
[564.60 → 565.02] in the New Testament,
[565.18 → 566.06] defending slavery.
[566.68 → 568.00] He, in a very creative way,
[568.06 → 568.36] I would say,
[568.40 → 569.38] is dismantling it.
[569.68 → 570.90] But he's not doing it the way we would think.
[570.96 → 572.32] He's not just writing one letter where he says,
[572.46 → 574.42] this is why slavery can't exist,
[574.82 → 576.36] because Jesus has raised from the dead.
[576.90 → 577.92] What he does is,
[578.00 → 578.62] in this passage,
[578.82 → 579.30] in Corinthians,
[579.50 → 580.30] also in Colossians,
[580.50 → 582.20] he speaks to slaves.
[582.72 → 584.26] Because that's his community, right?
[584.90 → 585.32] And he says,
[585.46 → 586.58] this is how the gospel
[586.58 → 588.64] transforms your work
[588.64 → 590.68] tomorrow morning when you wake up
[590.68 → 592.76] and you're working for that master in the household.
[593.44 → 594.16] It's pretty powerful.
[594.26 → 594.54] You think about it.
[594.56 → 596.94] He's not just like writing some theological treaty
[596.94 → 597.58] that's at a distance.
[597.76 → 599.18] He's speaking to slaves
[599.18 → 600.90] in this world of Rome
[600.90 → 602.76] where 30% of the culture was slaves.
[603.06 → 604.32] And he has so much to say to them about,
[604.42 → 605.28] this is why you work.
[605.36 → 606.12] This is how you work.
[606.18 → 607.36] This is the purpose of your work.
[607.50 → 608.94] Now that you belong to Jesus.
[610.18 → 611.20] And if I had more time,
[611.28 → 612.04] I'd elaborate on this.
[612.10 → 613.04] But I just want you to know
[613.04 → 614.42] that so many people have written
[614.42 → 616.64] about what the New Testament has written
[616.64 → 617.38] about slavery.
[618.02 → 619.64] And some of the best minds have said,
[619.80 → 620.16] Paul,
[620.60 → 622.78] as he brings the gospel to bear on slavery,
[623.32 → 624.52] he dismantles it.
[624.94 → 625.68] That is to say,
[625.74 → 627.00] as he speaks to how it changes
[627.00 → 628.22] the master's view of slaves,
[628.48 → 630.96] how it humanizes the actual slaves themselves
[630.96 → 631.86] and dignifies them,
[632.12 → 633.66] slavery can't survive
[633.66 → 636.34] the force of the gospel of Jesus
[636.34 → 638.98] because it so dignifies work
[638.98 → 640.32] and the work of people
[640.32 → 642.24] and the relationship between people
[642.24 → 642.88] in the first century.
[642.88 → 643.56] And I think that's true
[643.56 → 644.44] of every generation.
[645.24 → 646.60] And those who believe in the Bible
[646.60 → 647.76] will always be on the forefront
[647.76 → 649.42] of abolishing slavery.
[651.22 → 652.58] But here's the fascinating thing,
[652.64 → 653.04] at least to me,
[653.08 → 653.68] in the first century,
[654.02 → 655.10] guess which group of people
[655.10 → 656.62] came to Christ in droves?
[658.14 → 658.50] Slaves.
[658.98 → 659.60] Poor slaves.
[659.68 → 660.52] When they heard the gospel
[660.52 → 661.24] of Jesus pronounced,
[661.34 → 661.80] when they heard about
[661.80 → 662.52] what it meant to them,
[662.80 → 663.32] they said,
[663.68 → 665.58] that's good news.
[666.80 → 668.28] And why do you think it is
[668.28 → 669.84] the case that so many slaves
[669.84 → 670.44] came to faith?
[670.44 → 672.60] Any guesses?
[674.30 → 675.60] I think there's a variety of reasons.
[676.50 → 676.98] Number one,
[677.04 → 678.02] you're probably already thinking this,
[678.26 → 679.22] it dignifies them.
[679.90 → 680.06] You know,
[680.08 → 681.20] a culture where they belonged
[681.20 → 682.80] as property to their slave master,
[683.38 → 684.38] where in many cases
[684.38 → 685.14] they would have been abused
[685.14 → 685.94] without recourse,
[686.16 → 687.44] now they hear this gospel
[687.44 → 688.46] about them being brothers
[688.46 → 689.90] and sisters in a family,
[690.86 → 692.24] heirs of salvation,
[693.12 → 695.02] inheritors of the new creation,
[695.46 → 697.30] parts of the family.
[697.74 → 698.94] It dignifies them.
[699.22 → 700.20] They're children of the Father,
[700.36 → 701.26] bought with the blood of Jesus.
[701.62 → 704.16] They matter in God's kingdom,
[704.42 → 705.32] in Jesus' economy.
[705.80 → 707.06] What a dignifying gospel
[707.06 → 707.88] that would be for slaves.
[708.10 → 709.22] But not only that,
[710.18 → 711.40] it empowers their work.
[712.22 → 712.34] You know,
[712.36 → 712.94] in this passage,
[713.04 → 713.92] if we were able to do
[713.92 → 714.90] our very best to get
[714.90 → 715.56] into the mind
[715.56 → 716.68] and the perspective of a slave,
[717.10 → 718.32] you hear over and over again
[718.32 → 719.02] that Paul's saying,
[719.42 → 721.36] God sees your work.
[722.32 → 723.46] And though it may not be seen
[723.46 → 723.90] by others,
[724.00 → 724.80] it may not be noble
[724.80 → 725.92] by other people's perspective,
[725.92 → 726.76] he sees it,
[726.82 → 727.38] he knows it,
[727.40 → 728.38] it matters to him.
[728.94 → 729.60] And by the way,
[729.72 → 731.02] Jesus is now your boss.
[731.46 → 732.20] He's your master.
[732.56 → 733.60] And what he sees
[733.60 → 734.66] and what he thinks
[734.66 → 735.26] is what matters
[735.26 → 736.10] at the end of the day.
[736.74 → 737.64] It just transforms
[737.64 → 738.82] the world of slaves.
[739.48 → 740.62] Transforms the institution
[740.62 → 741.70] of slavery.
[742.16 → 743.26] And it's good news
[743.26 → 744.34] for the slaves
[744.34 → 745.08] in the first century.
[747.90 → 749.36] So there's my two-minute
[749.36 → 750.68] tag on slavery.
[750.68 → 753.40] But what's striking to me
[753.40 → 754.48] about Paul's words
[754.48 → 755.12] to slaves,
[755.42 → 756.54] and not just in Ephesians,
[756.64 → 757.70] but also in Corinthians
[757.70 → 758.66] and Colossians,
[759.06 → 760.60] is that he never says to them,
[760.88 → 761.52] you've got to run out
[761.52 → 762.38] of this situation.
[763.22 → 763.94] He doesn't even say
[763.94 → 764.66] to Christian families
[764.66 → 765.08] and households,
[765.22 → 765.90] hey, now that you've come
[765.90 → 766.40] to Christ,
[766.78 → 767.72] you've got to do something
[767.72 → 768.72] completely differently.
[769.10 → 769.34] In fact,
[769.46 → 770.62] in 1 Corinthians,
[771.02 → 771.70] he repeats,
[771.84 → 772.82] like, stay where you are
[772.82 → 773.98] and allow the gospel
[773.98 → 775.36] to transform what you do.
[776.10 → 776.70] And yes,
[776.76 → 777.66] your work may not feel
[777.66 → 778.70] important in the culture.
[778.70 → 779.92] There's much more dignified,
[780.02 → 780.84] high-status positions.
[781.04 → 782.00] But the work you do
[782.00 → 784.34] matters in light of Jesus.
[785.16 → 785.90] That's significant.
[786.02 → 787.06] Even the unseen work,
[787.16 → 788.00] the uncool work,
[788.08 → 789.14] the low-status work,
[789.28 → 792.10] that matters to Jesus.
[793.44 → 794.36] So Paul says to them,
[794.44 → 795.32] stay where you are
[795.32 → 796.48] and allow the gospel
[796.48 → 797.82] to transform what you do,
[798.02 → 798.82] even when it's hard,
[799.02 → 799.86] even when it's unseen,
[800.22 → 801.34] even when it's uncelebrated
[801.34 → 801.94] and unpaid.
[803.48 → 805.36] And if you're on our social media,
[805.48 → 806.00] you'll know that
[806.00 → 807.44] I posted a quote
[807.44 → 808.58] on Labour Day about work.
[809.30 → 809.42] Now,
[809.44 → 809.82] this is written
[809.82 → 810.84] by Martin Luther King Jr.
[810.96 → 812.62] It's about street sweepers,
[812.78 → 813.80] and now we have machines
[813.80 → 814.30] that do it.
[814.62 → 815.78] But for many, many years,
[815.94 → 816.44] street sweepers
[816.44 → 816.74] were people
[816.74 → 817.30] who sort of clean
[817.30 → 818.22] the garbage off the street,
[818.32 → 819.58] make sure it's sanitary
[819.58 → 820.20] and sweep it.
[820.50 → 821.58] And it wasn't considered,
[821.68 → 821.82] you know,
[821.86 → 823.52] a high-value job
[823.52 → 824.14] to many people.
[824.82 → 825.64] And about that,
[825.76 → 826.64] Martin Luther King Jr.
[826.70 → 827.34] writes this,
[827.34 → 829.70] if it falls to your lot
[829.70 → 831.32] to be a street sweeper,
[832.24 → 832.86] sweep streets
[832.86 → 834.04] like Michelangelo
[834.04 → 835.10] painted pictures
[835.10 → 837.56] or Beethoven composed music.
[838.12 → 838.64] Sweep streets
[838.64 → 839.70] like Leonine Price
[839.70 → 840.30] sings before
[840.30 → 841.56] the Metropolitan Opera.
[842.00 → 842.52] Sweep streets
[842.52 → 843.22] like Shakespeare
[843.22 → 844.32] wrote poetry.
[845.14 → 845.78] I love that.
[846.18 → 846.54] And then,
[847.02 → 847.88] sweep streets
[847.88 → 848.74] so well
[848.74 → 849.68] that all the hosts
[849.68 → 850.78] of heaven and earth
[850.78 → 852.08] will pause and say,
[852.08 → 853.44] here lived a great
[853.44 → 854.50] street sweeper
[854.50 → 857.22] who swept his job well.
[858.36 → 859.26] Don't you love that quote?
[861.74 → 862.48] And it's assumed,
[862.62 → 863.02] of course,
[863.06 → 864.00] that the Father
[864.00 → 864.78] sees the work,
[865.02 → 865.98] that He knows the work,
[866.02 → 867.72] and the work matters
[867.72 → 869.24] right down to sweeping
[869.24 → 871.02] the dirt off the sidewalk.
[875.42 → 876.30] The assumption
[876.30 → 876.96] in the Scriptures
[876.96 → 878.36] about work
[878.36 → 878.74] in the Old
[878.74 → 879.60] and the New Testament
[879.60 → 881.32] is that work-done well
[881.32 → 882.06] is always a blessing.
[882.78 → 883.68] It blesses families,
[884.32 → 885.54] it blesses co-workers,
[885.70 → 886.54] it blesses cities.
[887.08 → 887.74] And we should know
[887.74 → 888.80] that even our work today
[888.80 → 889.30] done well
[889.30 → 891.20] will always lead to blessing.
[891.62 → 892.62] It will always benefit
[892.62 → 893.80] the lives of other people.
[894.34 → 895.38] And one of my favourite things
[895.38 → 896.36] about our church
[896.36 → 897.28] is that we have this group
[897.28 → 897.96] called Surge.
[898.02 → 898.64] It's a nine-month
[898.64 → 899.58] discipleship intensive.
[900.10 → 901.24] And the fourth quarter
[901.24 → 901.66] of Surge,
[901.70 → 902.50] the very end of it,
[902.68 → 903.48] we spend eight weeks
[903.48 → 904.46] talking about the gospel
[904.46 → 905.66] and our work.
[905.98 → 906.78] And it's my favourite quarter
[906.78 → 907.98] because I get to hear from you.
[908.28 → 908.34] Like,
[908.50 → 909.24] how does the gospel
[909.24 → 910.02] shape your work?
[910.16 → 910.98] Where is it speaking
[910.98 → 911.58] into the pain
[911.58 → 912.16] and the difficulty
[912.16 → 913.16] and the challenges
[913.16 → 914.14] you face as a Christian
[914.14 → 914.72] in your workplace?
[915.20 → 915.50] And it's,
[915.82 → 917.20] I should say on the side here,
[917.46 → 918.10] I've learned
[918.10 → 919.34] that work is a hard thing
[919.34 → 920.04] for many of us.
[920.68 → 922.02] And we face real challenges
[922.02 → 922.70] in our workplaces
[922.70 → 923.30] as disciples.
[923.42 → 924.72] And I think that tension shows,
[924.96 → 925.78] when you feel that tension,
[925.88 → 926.68] it shows that you're seeking
[926.68 → 927.28] to be a disciple
[927.28 → 927.82] because if you don't feel
[927.82 → 928.64] the tension in your workplace,
[928.88 → 929.72] you're probably buying
[929.72 → 930.60] into a false story.
[930.60 → 932.22] But I remember in Surge
[932.22 → 932.90] two years ago,
[933.66 → 934.42] I got to know Sean
[934.42 → 934.98] and Carrie Hamlin.
[935.12 → 936.42] Carrie was leading up here.
[937.08 → 937.98] And they were sharing,
[938.08 → 938.94] Sean was sharing his story
[938.94 → 940.02] about working for PCL.
[940.18 → 941.86] PCL is a big construction firm.
[942.28 → 943.76] I think it's located in BC.
[944.10 → 944.72] Is that true, Carrie?
[945.60 → 946.36] That's not true.
[946.80 → 947.08] Anyway,
[947.72 → 948.44] Sean was doing
[948.44 → 949.66] this consulting work.
[949.72 → 950.94] He's an engineer for PCL
[950.94 → 952.48] and he's helping in Alberta
[952.48 → 953.54] build this big hospital.
[954.20 → 955.16] And part of his job
[955.16 → 955.66] is consulting
[955.66 → 956.76] with all the vested people
[956.76 → 957.26] who are interested
[957.26 → 957.86] in this project
[957.86 → 958.64] and how it should go.
[958.84 → 959.44] And he actually met
[959.44 → 960.26] with a number of people,
[960.36 → 961.16] including doctors,
[961.24 → 961.72] to say, okay,
[961.88 → 963.12] how should these rooms be built?
[963.32 → 964.52] How should we design these rooms
[964.52 → 965.64] when people come in
[965.64 → 966.20] to receive care?
[966.42 → 967.06] What should be there?
[967.12 → 968.04] How should it be worked out?
[968.52 → 969.64] And so fast-forward
[969.64 → 971.14] a few years' time,
[971.18 → 971.96] the hospital's built.
[972.36 → 973.34] His work is done there.
[973.70 → 974.40] But Sean and Carrie
[974.40 → 975.14] are having kids
[975.14 → 975.60] and it turns out
[975.60 → 976.74] their second son, Tom,
[976.80 → 977.90] who's here in the 9 a.m. service,
[978.20 → 979.36] he needs to have his eyes examined.
[979.96 → 980.66] And so they take Tom
[980.66 → 981.18] to the hospital.
[981.30 → 982.24] They sit in this hospital room,
[982.32 → 983.40] the very same hospital
[983.40 → 984.40] that Sean helped design.
[985.10 → 985.78] And the person,
[985.88 → 987.16] the doctor who walks in the room,
[987.16 → 988.48] the ophthalmologist,
[988.62 → 989.40] if that's the right word,
[989.92 → 991.02] was the same person
[991.02 → 992.52] that Sean consulted with
[992.52 → 993.44] in the building of the hospital.
[994.44 → 995.36] So it's this cool moment.
[995.42 → 996.32] Here he's sitting with his son
[996.32 → 996.74] and his wife
[996.74 → 997.42] in the hospital bed
[997.42 → 998.32] and this doctor
[998.32 → 999.14] is the same doctor
[999.14 → 999.78] who, you know,
[999.84 → 1000.36] he met with
[1000.36 → 1001.12] to design the hospital.
[1001.24 → 1001.96] But now,
[1002.54 → 1004.06] Sean's on the receiving end
[1004.06 → 1004.80] of the care
[1004.80 → 1005.88] and he's being blessed
[1005.88 → 1006.56] by some of the work
[1006.56 → 1007.64] he now originally did.
[1008.46 → 1009.12] And for me,
[1009.22 → 1010.16] that's just this picture
[1010.16 → 1011.70] of work that blesses
[1011.70 → 1012.82] and he just happened
[1012.82 → 1013.50] to have the benefit
[1013.50 → 1014.50] of now having the people
[1014.50 → 1015.28] using that space
[1015.28 → 1016.82] to bless him back, right?
[1017.46 → 1018.72] He designs a hospital room
[1018.72 → 1019.68] with his gifts.
[1019.92 → 1020.56] He's an engineer
[1020.56 → 1021.58] that can design these rooms.
[1021.84 → 1022.80] Then the doctor comes in
[1022.80 → 1023.42] with their gifts,
[1023.72 → 1024.92] their special abilities,
[1025.12 → 1026.92] and is able to bless his son
[1026.92 → 1027.90] in the room
[1027.90 → 1028.78] he was able to design.
[1030.04 → 1031.20] Work done well
[1031.20 → 1032.62] always leads
[1032.62 → 1033.16] to the blessing
[1033.16 → 1034.12] of our city.
[1035.18 → 1035.88] And I believe
[1035.88 → 1036.78] that Christians need to be
[1036.78 → 1037.94] at the forefront of that.
[1038.78 → 1039.24] We need to be able
[1039.24 → 1040.00] to show the world
[1040.00 → 1040.92] how we do work
[1040.92 → 1042.02] as kingdom servants
[1042.02 → 1043.02] who wash the feet
[1043.02 → 1043.56] of the world
[1043.56 → 1044.48] with the gifts
[1044.48 → 1045.12] we've been given,
[1045.52 → 1046.44] the short lives
[1046.44 → 1047.16] we've been given,
[1047.40 → 1048.68] and the time we have
[1048.68 → 1050.12] in these spaces,
[1050.40 → 1051.14] in these places,
[1051.50 → 1052.36] even in the jobs
[1052.36 → 1053.64] we don't like.
[1057.92 → 1058.32] Now,
[1058.38 → 1058.88] in our passage,
[1058.98 → 1059.70] a key piece
[1059.70 → 1061.52] of the teaching
[1061.52 → 1062.24] that Paul gives
[1062.24 → 1062.82] to the slaves
[1062.82 → 1064.02] is actually not just
[1064.02 → 1065.44] how to bless people.
[1065.52 → 1065.66] In fact,
[1065.70 → 1066.18] he doesn't talk
[1066.18 → 1066.96] a great deal about that
[1066.96 → 1067.46] in this passage.
[1067.74 → 1068.46] He talks about
[1068.46 → 1069.72] who you work for.
[1070.14 → 1070.64] And I want to read
[1070.64 → 1071.22] for us again
[1071.22 → 1072.46] what Paul says
[1072.46 → 1073.48] to this group of slaves
[1073.48 → 1075.02] in Ephesus.
[1075.16 → 1075.48] He writes,
[1075.60 → 1075.98] Slaves,
[1076.10 → 1077.58] obey your earthly masters
[1077.58 → 1079.70] with respect and fear
[1079.70 → 1081.20] and with sincerity of heart
[1081.20 → 1082.76] just as you would
[1082.76 → 1083.60] obey Christ.
[1084.44 → 1084.88] Obey them
[1084.88 → 1085.90] not only to win their favour
[1085.90 → 1087.30] when their eye is on you,
[1087.70 → 1089.02] but as slaves of Christ
[1089.02 → 1090.14] doing the will of God
[1090.14 → 1091.12] from your heart,
[1092.04 → 1093.56] serve wholeheartedly
[1093.56 → 1095.28] as if you were serving
[1095.28 → 1095.74] the Lord,
[1095.86 → 1096.56] not people,
[1096.92 → 1097.56] because you know
[1097.56 → 1098.08] that the Lord
[1098.08 → 1099.54] will reward each one of you
[1099.54 → 1100.74] whatever good they do,
[1101.02 → 1101.96] whether they are a slave
[1101.96 → 1102.86] or free.
[1105.30 → 1106.52] What would it look like
[1106.52 → 1107.98] for you to wake up
[1107.98 → 1108.60] tomorrow morning
[1108.60 → 1110.30] and go to your place
[1110.30 → 1110.64] of work,
[1110.70 → 1111.34] which maybe now
[1111.34 → 1111.78] in this season
[1111.78 → 1112.64] is the kitchen table
[1112.64 → 1113.22] with your laptop,
[1113.78 → 1114.70] what would it look like
[1114.70 → 1115.58] for you to go
[1115.58 → 1116.74] with that perspective?
[1117.80 → 1118.68] I'm not here
[1118.68 → 1120.26] to win my master's eye
[1120.26 → 1120.82] of approval.
[1121.42 → 1122.74] I'm here to serve Christ.
[1123.40 → 1124.18] I'm not here
[1124.18 → 1124.96] to cut the corners
[1124.96 → 1126.24] and toe the line
[1126.24 → 1127.20] for the company profit
[1127.20 → 1127.92] first and foremost.
[1127.92 → 1129.68] I'm here to serve Jesus.
[1130.58 → 1131.16] And I'm not here
[1131.16 → 1131.72] half-heartedly,
[1131.82 → 1133.92] I'm here wholeheartedly
[1133.92 → 1135.38] to be diligent
[1135.38 → 1136.74] and faithful
[1136.74 → 1137.80] and productive
[1137.80 → 1139.08] with all that
[1139.08 → 1139.76] I've been given.
[1140.98 → 1141.56] Don't you think
[1141.56 → 1142.22] that would transform
[1142.22 → 1142.74] your workspace?
[1144.20 → 1144.48] I mean,
[1144.52 → 1145.14] I don't know if you've,
[1145.22 → 1145.40] I mean,
[1145.46 → 1146.38] I'm sure we've all done this,
[1146.48 → 1147.86] but in your places of work,
[1147.94 → 1148.78] you know the ways
[1148.78 → 1149.72] that corners are cut.
[1150.56 → 1151.14] You know the ways
[1151.14 → 1152.00] that people abuse
[1152.00 → 1152.46] the privileges.
[1153.00 → 1153.62] You know the way
[1153.62 → 1154.42] they dehumanize
[1154.42 → 1154.94] other people
[1154.94 → 1156.14] or betray people
[1156.14 → 1156.88] or cut corners
[1156.88 → 1157.56] to make profit.
[1157.66 → 1158.30] You know all of it.
[1158.36 → 1158.92] It's your workplace.
[1159.62 → 1161.06] Sometimes it's very discouraging
[1161.06 → 1162.02] to be in a place of work
[1162.02 → 1162.74] for a long period of time
[1162.74 → 1163.68] because you see all the mess.
[1164.94 → 1165.58] But imagine
[1165.58 → 1166.88] the disciples of Jesus
[1166.88 → 1169.18] are known for people
[1169.18 → 1169.92] who don't do that
[1169.92 → 1170.74] because they serve
[1170.74 → 1171.30] a different master.
[1171.38 → 1171.78] They're not there
[1171.78 → 1172.52] for the bottom line.
[1173.10 → 1173.52] They're not there
[1173.52 → 1174.12] first and foremost
[1174.12 → 1174.78] for the paycheck
[1174.78 → 1175.54] at the end of the month.
[1176.04 → 1176.34] They're there
[1176.34 → 1177.18] as kingdom servants
[1177.18 → 1178.36] who want to wash
[1178.36 → 1179.08] the feet of the world
[1179.08 → 1179.62] in their workplace.
[1181.18 → 1182.36] When I worked at Toyota,
[1182.78 → 1183.84] many years ago now,
[1184.72 → 1185.64] I remember I was working
[1185.64 → 1186.10] on the line
[1186.10 → 1186.82] building the vehicles
[1186.82 → 1187.60] as a summer student.
[1187.76 → 1188.86] It was very well paying
[1188.86 → 1191.92] and very, very repetitive work
[1191.92 → 1193.24] that not a lot of people loved.
[1194.10 → 1194.92] And for the first year
[1194.92 → 1195.12] I was there
[1195.12 → 1196.12] we worked on the door line
[1196.12 → 1197.22] and a car comes by
[1197.22 → 1198.14] every 56 seconds
[1198.14 → 1199.26] and you put the weather strip on
[1199.26 → 1200.24] and all these electric components
[1200.24 → 1200.94] Ada Ada Ada.
[1201.02 → 1202.28] There are lots of parts behind you
[1202.28 → 1203.84] and it's a very fast moving environment.
[1204.54 → 1205.34] And I found that the people
[1205.34 → 1206.42] who worked there a long time,
[1206.56 → 1207.52] they could do this
[1207.52 → 1208.36] with their eyes closed.
[1208.76 → 1210.04] And the longer they worked there
[1210.04 → 1210.52] they realized,
[1210.64 → 1211.86] okay, I have this many doors
[1211.86 → 1212.84] before our break
[1212.84 → 1213.84] and they knew that
[1213.84 → 1215.26] they could let all their parts
[1215.26 → 1216.48] in these bins behind them
[1216.48 → 1217.60] sort of deplete
[1217.60 → 1218.34] because they wouldn't have
[1218.34 → 1218.90] to refill them
[1218.90 → 1219.74] because the break was coming.
[1219.86 → 1220.76] And the best of them
[1220.76 → 1222.26] would have like nothing was there
[1222.26 → 1223.34] by the end of the break
[1223.34 → 1224.56] so that the second the bell went
[1224.56 → 1225.60] they would go off to the lunchroom
[1225.60 → 1226.84] and then the next person
[1226.84 → 1227.62] would have to refill
[1227.62 → 1228.20] all their bins.
[1228.62 → 1229.72] It drove me crazy
[1229.72 → 1230.46] because I was always going
[1230.46 → 1230.88] to these bins
[1230.88 → 1231.96] and I wasn't fast enough
[1231.96 → 1233.36] trying to catch up to everybody
[1233.36 → 1234.40] and then the line would start.
[1234.48 → 1235.10] It's very stressful.
[1235.52 → 1237.18] There was one guy on my line.
[1237.28 → 1237.92] His name was Abe,
[1238.08 → 1238.86] a Mennonite dude,
[1239.20 → 1240.08] such a good man,
[1240.08 → 1241.88] a very quiet Christian in his faith.
[1242.20 → 1243.76] Every time I went to Abe's station
[1243.76 → 1245.64] all the stuff was filled.
[1246.58 → 1247.78] And it was a small statement
[1247.78 → 1248.84] but a powerful statement
[1248.84 → 1249.52] on that line of
[1249.52 → 1250.80] this is how Abe,
[1250.88 → 1251.88] a disciple of Jesus,
[1252.42 → 1253.70] cares for his employees
[1253.70 → 1254.54] or his coworkers
[1254.54 → 1256.06] and does not cut corners
[1256.06 → 1257.10] because he's not there
[1257.10 → 1258.44] first and foremost for himself
[1258.44 → 1260.52] or to do the least amount of work
[1260.52 → 1261.62] and get away with it
[1261.62 → 1262.98] but to be a kingdom servant.
[1264.10 → 1264.76] And I remember Abe
[1264.76 → 1265.94] was the only one I could remember
[1265.94 → 1266.72] who found me
[1266.72 → 1267.74] and cared for me
[1267.74 → 1268.92] as an employee who was new
[1268.92 → 1269.92] and the only student on the line
[1269.92 → 1270.88] and served me
[1270.88 → 1271.68] in those small ways
[1271.68 → 1272.78] like filling my bins
[1272.78 → 1274.36] before I came on the line.
[1275.46 → 1276.92] What does that look like for you?
[1278.96 → 1280.16] What's the illustration of that
[1280.16 → 1281.00] in your workplace?
[1282.42 → 1283.34] Wholehearted servanthood.
[1283.88 → 1284.66] Serving not just
[1284.66 → 1285.46] because you have to,
[1285.80 → 1286.92] not just for the bottom line
[1286.92 → 1288.38] because you want to honour Christ
[1288.38 → 1289.88] and bless your neighbour
[1289.88 → 1290.70] through your work.
[1292.40 → 1293.56] A number of commentators
[1293.56 → 1294.18] on Ephesians
[1294.18 → 1295.06] have pointed out how
[1295.06 → 1296.26] in the NIV
[1296.26 → 1297.30] it doesn't give you
[1297.30 → 1298.34] the force of what Paul
[1298.34 → 1299.62] is saying about serving Jesus.
[1299.88 → 1300.68] In the NIV it says
[1300.68 → 1302.12] serve wholeheartedly
[1302.12 → 1304.12] as if you were serving the Lord
[1304.12 → 1305.14] but others say
[1305.14 → 1305.60] in the Greek
[1305.60 → 1306.72] it's far more forceful
[1306.72 → 1307.60] like it's you're serving
[1307.60 → 1308.42] to the Lord.
[1308.64 → 1309.50] He's actually the one
[1309.50 → 1310.22] who's got your eye,
[1310.28 → 1310.80] his eye on you
[1310.80 → 1311.46] and you need to be
[1311.46 → 1312.40] presenting your work
[1312.40 → 1313.08] to him.
[1314.02 → 1314.70] William Barclay,
[1314.80 → 1315.54] one commentator
[1315.54 → 1316.82] gives this take on it.
[1316.82 → 1317.38] I think I have the quote
[1317.38 → 1317.86] on the screen.
[1317.98 → 1318.34] He writes,
[1319.22 → 1320.60] work must be done well
[1320.60 → 1322.30] not only when the overseer's
[1322.30 → 1323.26] eye is on them,
[1323.50 → 1324.32] it must be done
[1324.32 → 1324.98] with an awareness
[1324.98 → 1326.00] that God's eye
[1326.00 → 1326.70] is on them.
[1327.06 → 1327.86] And here's the singer.
[1328.54 → 1330.00] Every single piece of work
[1330.00 → 1331.00] a Christian produces
[1331.00 → 1332.48] must be good enough
[1332.48 → 1333.42] to show God.
[1336.12 → 1337.24] How's that sit with you?
[1339.04 → 1339.64] Don't you find that
[1339.64 → 1340.68] a challenging quote?
[1341.62 → 1342.62] Every piece of work
[1342.62 → 1343.52] a Christian produces
[1343.52 → 1344.48] must be good enough
[1344.48 → 1345.50] to show God.
[1347.78 → 1348.94] I read this week
[1348.94 → 1350.28] that one quarter
[1350.28 → 1351.00] of Americans
[1351.00 → 1352.32] are quoted
[1352.32 → 1354.20] deeply ashamed
[1354.20 → 1355.74] of what they produce
[1355.74 → 1356.30] in their work.
[1357.28 → 1358.06] I'm sure that doesn't
[1358.06 → 1358.52] surprise you.
[1358.54 → 1359.10] I'm sure that's true
[1359.10 → 1359.78] in Canada as well.
[1360.02 → 1360.66] This sense of
[1360.66 → 1361.84] I am deeply ashamed
[1361.84 → 1363.24] of what I'm doing
[1363.24 → 1364.04] with my work.
[1364.56 → 1365.06] And there's a lot
[1365.06 → 1365.60] of reasons for that.
[1365.64 → 1366.34] I think for some people
[1366.34 → 1367.14] it's recognizing that
[1367.14 → 1367.96] hey, you're giving
[1367.96 → 1369.08] like a good chunk
[1369.08 → 1369.54] of your life
[1369.54 → 1370.70] to maybe like a toy
[1370.70 → 1371.44] or a technology
[1371.44 → 1372.80] or an entertainment
[1372.80 → 1373.60] that's not actually
[1373.60 → 1374.66] helping people, right?
[1374.68 → 1375.18] It's just building
[1375.18 → 1375.98] a consumer world
[1375.98 → 1377.28] or you're doing
[1377.28 → 1377.74] all your work
[1377.74 → 1378.96] for this giant corporation
[1378.96 → 1379.90] that does not care
[1379.90 → 1380.46] about people
[1380.46 → 1381.26] but is chasing
[1381.26 → 1381.96] after profit
[1381.96 → 1383.56] and in the process
[1383.56 → 1384.36] actually destroying
[1384.36 → 1384.88] the environment
[1384.88 → 1386.08] in one way or another, right?
[1386.48 → 1387.00] And the longer
[1387.00 → 1387.90] you're in a workplace
[1387.90 → 1388.56] you sort of see
[1388.56 → 1389.28] okay, this is
[1389.28 → 1390.54] I'm just one little piece
[1390.54 → 1391.46] in this big machine
[1391.46 → 1392.32] and this machine
[1392.32 → 1392.98] is not looking out
[1392.98 → 1393.70] for the little people.
[1394.22 → 1394.72] It's looking out
[1394.72 → 1395.20] for the profit
[1395.20 → 1395.78] and you have this
[1395.78 → 1396.72] deep tension
[1396.72 → 1397.14] that I think
[1397.14 → 1397.58] every Christian
[1397.58 → 1398.06] should have
[1398.06 → 1398.90] saying okay
[1398.90 → 1399.98] here's the injustice
[1399.98 → 1400.64] of my workplace
[1400.64 → 1401.16] here's where
[1401.16 → 1402.44] idolatry is at work
[1402.44 → 1403.64] how do I faithfully
[1403.64 → 1404.82] live out my work
[1404.82 → 1406.24] in this situation?
[1408.40 → 1409.08] And I think
[1409.08 → 1409.92] we have to ask ourselves
[1409.92 → 1410.68] what would it look like
[1410.68 → 1411.70] for us to produce work
[1411.70 → 1412.18] in such a way
[1412.18 → 1413.10] that God sees it
[1413.10 → 1413.38] and you say
[1413.38 → 1414.90] God, this is my
[1414.90 → 1416.18] honest attempt
[1416.18 → 1417.14] to be faithful to you
[1417.14 → 1417.98] with what I produce
[1417.98 → 1420.50] to do excellent work
[1420.50 → 1421.42] in your sight
[1421.42 → 1423.88] working as unto you
[1423.88 → 1425.08] not just for the eye
[1425.08 → 1425.52] of approval
[1425.52 → 1426.36] from my coworkers
[1426.36 → 1427.52] or my bosses
[1427.52 → 1428.38] or my supervisors
[1428.38 → 1430.64] and yes
[1430.64 → 1431.20] I do think
[1431.20 → 1431.84] there's a challenge
[1431.84 → 1432.52] to this passage
[1432.52 → 1433.02] where it's like
[1433.02 → 1434.42] God sees your work
[1434.42 → 1435.72] he doesn't just see
[1435.72 → 1436.46] the work you're producing
[1436.46 → 1437.06] he also sees
[1437.06 → 1438.58] your posture at work
[1438.58 → 1439.78] whether you're loving
[1439.78 → 1440.24] your neighbours
[1440.24 → 1441.04] speaking well
[1441.04 → 1441.74] of your coworkers
[1441.74 → 1443.04] sort of owning
[1443.04 → 1443.92] what's your problem
[1443.92 → 1445.10] not just slandering people
[1445.10 → 1445.82] not being lazy
[1445.82 → 1446.44] not showing up
[1446.44 → 1447.50] with the wrong perspective
[1447.50 → 1448.14] on how to serve
[1448.14 → 1449.12] like God sees all that
[1449.12 → 1450.36] there's a challenge there
[1450.36 → 1451.86] but I also think
[1451.86 → 1452.52] in this passage
[1452.52 → 1455.04] there is profound encouragement
[1455.04 → 1456.14] and remember
[1456.14 → 1457.22] who is Paul speaking to?
[1458.22 → 1459.04] He's speaking to slaves
[1459.04 → 1460.50] and I think
[1460.50 → 1461.22] if you put yourself
[1461.22 → 1461.84] in the perspective
[1461.84 → 1462.44] of a slave
[1462.44 → 1463.22] and you hear this
[1463.22 → 1464.32] what Paul is saying
[1464.32 → 1464.82] to them is
[1464.82 → 1466.50] he sees your work
[1466.50 → 1468.10] he sees what
[1468.10 → 1469.24] nobody else sees
[1469.24 → 1470.88] he sees what
[1470.88 → 1471.84] every other master
[1471.84 → 1472.66] just takes for granted
[1472.66 → 1473.48] or uses you for
[1473.48 → 1474.02] as property
[1474.02 → 1475.96] God sees your work
[1475.96 → 1478.08] and he's delighted
[1478.08 → 1480.10] by good work done
[1480.10 → 1481.00] for him
[1481.00 → 1482.74] even if no one else notices
[1482.74 → 1484.22] is that encouraging?
[1484.84 → 1485.56] imagine how a slave
[1485.56 → 1486.10] would hear that
[1486.10 → 1487.58] and just to contextualize
[1487.58 → 1488.10] that for a minute
[1488.10 → 1488.76] let me just pull out
[1488.76 → 1489.22] some examples
[1489.22 → 1489.86] of how that might be
[1489.86 → 1490.70] the case for us today
[1490.70 → 1493.22] God sees
[1493.22 → 1496.72] the way you work faithfully
[1496.72 → 1499.30] and keep the social media down
[1499.30 → 1500.34] so you can be attentive
[1500.34 → 1501.62] to your actual work at hand
[1501.62 → 1504.20] he sees the way
[1504.20 → 1505.60] that you honour
[1505.60 → 1507.28] that other person
[1507.28 → 1507.88] on the phone
[1507.88 → 1509.72] or honour that other person
[1509.72 → 1510.22] on Zoom
[1510.22 → 1511.26] as an image bearer
[1511.26 → 1512.32] and not just a client
[1512.32 → 1513.80] not just potential revenue
[1513.80 → 1514.42] for the company
[1514.42 → 1516.08] but a human being
[1516.08 → 1517.12] created in the image of God
[1517.12 → 1517.88] he sees that
[1517.88 → 1518.96] and he delights
[1518.96 → 1519.54] in those ways
[1519.54 → 1520.56] that you acknowledge
[1520.56 → 1522.58] their image bearing nature
[1522.58 → 1524.98] he sees the way
[1524.98 → 1525.74] you care
[1525.74 → 1527.96] for those
[1527.96 → 1528.90] who are perhaps
[1528.90 → 1530.10] unable to care
[1530.10 → 1530.78] for themselves
[1530.78 → 1532.40] the quiet work done
[1532.40 → 1533.18] by care aides
[1533.18 → 1534.04] the quiet work done
[1534.04 → 1534.56] by seniors
[1534.56 → 1535.04] who are caring
[1535.04 → 1535.60] for a spouse
[1535.60 → 1536.14] who can no longer
[1536.14 → 1536.62] do everything
[1536.62 → 1536.98] on their own
[1536.98 → 1537.82] the quiet way
[1537.82 → 1538.30] you're working
[1538.30 → 1539.42] to care for a child
[1539.42 → 1541.06] who can't do things
[1541.06 → 1542.16] due to a certain disability
[1542.16 → 1543.22] God sees that
[1543.22 → 1545.04] and maybe no one notices
[1545.04 → 1546.04] maybe no one sees it
[1546.04 → 1547.00] maybe you'll never
[1547.00 → 1548.76] be compensated fairly for it
[1548.76 → 1549.98] but your heavenly father
[1549.98 → 1550.48] sees it
[1550.48 → 1551.80] he knows
[1551.80 → 1552.52] he cares
[1552.52 → 1553.48] and he delights
[1553.48 → 1554.48] when you do that work
[1554.48 → 1554.96] faithfully
[1554.96 → 1557.50] he sees the way
[1557.50 → 1558.76] you balance the budget
[1558.76 → 1560.26] and you don't
[1560.26 → 1561.12] cut corners
[1561.12 → 1562.34] the way you are
[1562.34 → 1563.06] above board
[1563.06 → 1563.84] with your finances
[1563.84 → 1564.88] and you want to make sure
[1564.88 → 1565.76] no one in the company
[1565.76 → 1566.74] present company included
[1566.74 → 1567.88] is abusing the finances
[1567.88 → 1568.96] because it matters
[1568.96 → 1569.78] in the sight of Christ
[1569.78 → 1572.28] he sees the way
[1572.28 → 1573.54] you listen
[1573.54 → 1575.26] and are slow to speak
[1575.26 → 1577.64] and let me say
[1577.64 → 1578.20] to those of us
[1578.20 → 1578.68] who maybe aren't
[1578.68 → 1579.38] in paid employment
[1579.38 → 1580.94] he sees the labour
[1580.94 → 1581.36] you do
[1581.36 → 1582.26] perhaps in the home
[1582.26 → 1583.04] changing diapers
[1583.04 → 1583.82] making meals
[1583.82 → 1584.64] and you're getting
[1584.64 → 1585.24] no paycheck
[1585.24 → 1586.04] and no one's
[1586.04 → 1587.06] giving you accolades
[1587.06 → 1587.70] for that work at home
[1587.70 → 1588.32] he sees it
[1588.32 → 1589.48] and he delights in it
[1589.48 → 1590.54] to those of us
[1590.54 → 1591.12] who are retired
[1591.12 → 1592.00] who are serving
[1592.00 → 1592.50] with our gifts
[1592.50 → 1592.98] and no one's
[1592.98 → 1593.54] paying us for that
[1593.54 → 1593.94] no one's even
[1593.94 → 1594.64] that concerned
[1594.64 → 1595.00] about whether
[1595.00 → 1595.56] we do it or not
[1595.56 → 1596.38] he sees it
[1596.38 → 1597.94] and he delights
[1597.94 → 1598.78] in faithful service
[1598.78 → 1599.66] well past the years
[1599.66 → 1600.72] of paid employment
[1600.72 → 1602.88] and what I love
[1602.88 → 1603.76] about how Paul
[1603.76 → 1604.82] ends on this one
[1604.82 → 1605.66] he basically says
[1605.66 → 1606.78] this is my own paraphrasing
[1606.78 → 1608.52] even if nobody notices
[1608.52 → 1609.48] nobody cares
[1609.48 → 1610.38] no one stops
[1610.38 → 1610.94] to thank you
[1610.94 → 1611.82] and no one pays you
[1611.82 → 1612.14] for it
[1612.14 → 1612.36] he says
[1612.36 → 1613.54] your heavenly father
[1613.54 → 1614.00] sees it
[1614.00 → 1615.62] and he will reward you
[1615.62 → 1617.14] for what you have done
[1617.14 → 1619.04] isn't that powerful
[1619.04 → 1620.22] think again
[1620.22 → 1621.18] these are slaves
[1621.18 → 1622.36] no one's going to
[1622.36 → 1623.26] thank them for their work
[1623.26 → 1623.84] and Paul says
[1623.84 → 1625.46] the reward will come
[1625.46 → 1625.70] for you
[1625.70 → 1626.56] because your heavenly father
[1626.56 → 1627.64] is just loving
[1627.64 → 1628.06] and good
[1628.06 → 1628.94] and he will give you
[1628.94 → 1629.46] the inheritance
[1629.46 → 1630.60] that you deserve
[1630.60 → 1631.36] deserve
[1631.36 → 1632.44] that is received
[1632.44 → 1633.42] and grace by Christ
[1633.42 → 1635.98] and I find western people
[1635.98 → 1636.76] we get so uncomfortable
[1636.76 → 1637.72] when we hear him saying
[1637.72 → 1638.70] he's going to reward you
[1638.70 → 1639.74] for the good work
[1639.74 → 1640.14] you've done
[1640.14 → 1641.12] but the truth is
[1641.12 → 1641.56] Paul says
[1641.56 → 1642.02] these slaves
[1642.02 → 1643.76] who do thankless work
[1643.76 → 1644.40] that no one sees
[1644.40 → 1644.72] he says
[1644.72 → 1645.84] when you die
[1645.84 → 1648.16] when your hard work
[1648.16 → 1648.60] is done
[1648.60 → 1649.36] when all of it
[1649.36 → 1649.76] is finished
[1649.76 → 1650.80] when your hands
[1650.80 → 1651.22] are sore
[1651.22 → 1651.88] from all the labour
[1651.88 → 1652.50] when your body
[1652.50 → 1653.00] is breaking down
[1653.00 → 1653.52] from all the labour
[1653.52 → 1654.20] and you finally die
[1654.20 → 1655.14] you get to be
[1655.14 → 1656.20] with Christ forever
[1656.20 → 1658.64] you get to receive
[1658.64 → 1659.84] the internal inheritance
[1659.84 → 1660.50] the salvation
[1660.50 → 1661.30] of your souls
[1661.30 → 1662.22] says 1 Peter
[1662.22 → 1663.20] a new creation
[1663.20 → 1664.00] and a new body
[1664.00 → 1664.76] to live in forever
[1664.76 → 1666.02] that's your reward
[1666.02 → 1666.90] slaves
[1666.90 → 1668.46] you want to talk about
[1668.46 → 1670.22] the gospel dignifies slaves
[1670.22 → 1670.88] Paul's saying
[1670.88 → 1671.68] you get to live
[1671.68 → 1672.72] as a forever people
[1672.72 → 1674.20] because you believe
[1674.20 → 1674.60] in Jesus
[1674.60 → 1676.44] he's the one
[1676.44 → 1677.08] you work for
[1677.08 → 1678.08] he's the one
[1678.08 → 1678.70] who shapes the way
[1678.70 → 1679.30] you do your work
[1679.30 → 1679.94] and when it's all
[1679.94 → 1680.62] said and done
[1680.62 → 1681.88] you have a place
[1681.88 → 1682.46] at the seat
[1682.46 → 1683.50] of the banquet table
[1683.50 → 1684.36] of Jesus Christ
[1684.36 → 1689.30] so to summarize
[1689.30 → 1692.06] don't retreat
[1692.06 → 1692.98] says Paul
[1692.98 → 1694.74] from the hard work
[1694.74 → 1697.30] stay where you are
[1697.30 → 1697.98] in your city
[1697.98 → 1698.70] your place
[1698.70 → 1701.14] and use the time
[1701.14 → 1702.06] the gifts
[1702.06 → 1703.18] the skills you have
[1703.18 → 1704.56] to serve
[1704.56 → 1706.04] and oh by the way
[1706.04 → 1706.98] you don't just work
[1706.98 → 1707.56] for an employer
[1707.56 → 1708.68] or a supervisor
[1708.68 → 1709.34] or a company
[1709.34 → 1710.42] you work for
[1710.42 → 1711.14] Jesus Christ
[1711.14 → 1713.22] that's the message
[1713.22 → 1714.44] of Ephesians 6
[1714.44 → 1717.62] and in your small groups
[1717.62 → 1718.04] this week
[1718.04 → 1718.98] around the kitchen table
[1718.98 → 1719.72] this afternoon
[1719.72 → 1720.54] I do encourage you
[1720.54 → 1721.86] to talk about your work
[1721.86 → 1723.30] where the thorns
[1723.30 → 1724.12] and the thistles are
[1724.12 → 1725.58] where the tension points
[1725.58 → 1726.48] for you as a disciple
[1726.48 → 1727.64] of Jesus Christ are
[1727.64 → 1729.36] and bring that conversation
[1729.36 → 1729.70] to friends
[1729.70 → 1730.74] because I promise you
[1730.74 → 1731.78] even in this church
[1731.78 → 1732.88] so many of you
[1732.88 → 1733.58] are going through
[1733.58 → 1735.36] the same difficulties
[1735.36 → 1736.76] it doesn't surprise me
[1736.76 → 1737.12] at all that
[1737.12 → 1737.76] in many churches
[1737.76 → 1738.96] especially urban churches
[1738.96 → 1740.66] they're framing small groups
[1740.66 → 1741.46] now around vocations
[1741.46 → 1741.90] like okay
[1741.90 → 1742.88] you're in this field
[1742.88 → 1743.48] you're in that field
[1743.48 → 1744.26] you've got to talk together
[1744.26 → 1745.14] about how to follow Christ
[1745.14 → 1745.82] because it's hard
[1745.82 → 1747.10] it's very hard
[1747.10 → 1749.28] and if you're in this situation
[1749.28 → 1750.44] you're facing these challenges
[1750.44 → 1750.82] in COVID
[1750.82 → 1751.42] talk together
[1751.42 → 1751.96] pray together
[1751.96 → 1752.68] because it's hard
[1752.68 → 1754.00] we know it's hard
[1754.00 → 1754.74] we don't talk enough
[1754.74 → 1755.44] about how hard work
[1755.44 → 1756.20] can be for us
[1756.20 → 1759.84] my final word
[1759.84 → 1760.64] on this passage
[1760.64 → 1762.32] is for us
[1762.32 → 1763.28] to be kingdom servants
[1763.28 → 1764.10] who wash the feet
[1764.10 → 1764.66] of the world
[1764.66 → 1765.92] and serve the world
[1765.92 → 1767.56] with our gifts
[1767.56 → 1768.02] and our work
[1768.02 → 1769.02] we need Jesus
[1769.02 → 1769.96] so desperately
[1769.96 → 1771.74] I mean so desperately
[1771.74 → 1773.64] it's so easy
[1773.64 → 1774.12] for us to
[1774.12 → 1774.88] tomorrow morning
[1774.88 → 1775.36] when you go to work
[1775.36 → 1776.60] to buy into all the lies
[1776.60 → 1777.44] about why you work
[1777.44 → 1778.34] whether it's for the weekend
[1778.34 → 1778.90] or for the paycheck
[1778.90 → 1779.50] or for the status
[1779.50 → 1780.94] or whatever it is
[1780.94 → 1782.66] those lies are so pervasive
[1782.66 → 1783.66] and so powerful
[1783.66 → 1784.58] and they tug at our heart strings
[1784.58 → 1786.04] in such seductive ways
[1786.04 → 1787.46] we desperately need Jesus
[1787.46 → 1788.56] to smash open
[1788.56 → 1790.04] the false lies
[1790.04 → 1791.56] and stories about work
[1791.56 → 1793.26] and to feed into us
[1793.26 → 1794.24] by the power of the spirit
[1794.24 → 1794.94] and by the word
[1794.94 → 1796.22] the truth about why
[1796.22 → 1796.84] we do our work
[1796.84 → 1797.80] the truth about why
[1797.80 → 1798.84] we have this time on earth
[1798.84 → 1799.58] to serve with our gifts
[1799.58 → 1800.12] and our work
[1800.12 → 1801.64] we need each other also
[1801.64 → 1802.12] in that
[1802.12 → 1803.98] and so it seems to me
[1803.98 → 1804.86] the most appropriate way
[1804.86 → 1805.60] to finish this sermon
[1805.60 → 1806.32] is actually to give us
[1806.32 → 1807.00] some time to pray
[1807.00 → 1808.74] if you want to bring
[1808.74 → 1810.18] confession to Christ
[1810.18 → 1810.64] over the way
[1810.64 → 1811.94] you've been cutting corners
[1811.94 → 1812.76] the way you're struggling
[1812.76 → 1813.22] at work
[1813.22 → 1814.30] your posture at work
[1814.30 → 1815.34] you can bring that to Christ
[1815.34 → 1816.80] if you need encouragement
[1816.80 → 1818.24] allow Christ to minister
[1818.24 → 1819.02] to you in that prayer
[1819.02 → 1819.72] but I will start
[1819.72 → 1820.40] the time of prayer
[1820.40 → 1821.30] give us a lot of time
[1821.30 → 1821.70] for prayer
[1821.70 → 1822.68] and then I'll finish
[1822.68 → 1823.48] does that sound good?
[1824.16 → 1824.70] let's pray
[1824.70 → 1836.36] Father we begin this prayer
[1836.36 → 1837.54] by recognizing
[1837.54 → 1838.28] that it's hard
[1838.28 → 1840.66] it's hard to be faithful
[1840.66 → 1841.18] to you
[1841.18 → 1842.68] in our jobs
[1842.68 → 1845.02] there are all sorts of stuff
[1845.02 → 1845.82] we're not proud of
[1845.82 → 1846.78] the way we use our time
[1846.78 → 1847.80] the things we produce
[1847.80 → 1848.74] and we bring that
[1848.74 → 1849.60] before you now
[1849.60 → 1850.94] and we pray that you
[1850.94 → 1851.68] would meet us
[1851.68 → 1852.96] in this time of prayer
[1852.96 → 1854.48] as we talk with you
[1854.48 → 1855.18] about our work
[1882.96 → 1906.94] Father we ask you
[1906.94 → 1907.82] for your strength
[1907.82 → 1910.24] we ask you
[1910.24 → 1911.04] for your perseverance
[1911.04 → 1913.30] we ask you
[1913.30 → 1914.44] for kingdom boldness
[1914.44 → 1916.30] and we ask you
[1916.30 → 1917.08] for humility
[1917.08 → 1919.62] we pray that we would know
[1919.62 → 1920.60] how to love our neighbour
[1920.60 → 1921.52] in our work
[1921.52 → 1924.14] how to pour ourselves out
[1924.14 → 1925.10] for the sake of others
[1925.10 → 1925.78] in our work
[1925.78 → 1927.32] and how to be
[1927.32 → 1928.22] kingdom servants
[1928.22 → 1930.20] would you fill us
[1930.20 → 1930.84] mightily
[1930.84 → 1931.82] with your Holy Spirit
[1931.82 → 1933.34] and use us
[1933.34 → 1933.96] for your sake
[1933.96 → 1936.00] we pray in Christ's name
[1936.00 → 1936.62] Amen
[1936.62 → 1940.36] I invite you to stand
[1940.36 → 1941.02] and join me
[1941.02 → 1941.84] in singing a fitting
[1941.84 → 1942.82] song of response
[1942.82 → 1943.20] Jesus
[1943.84 → 1948.26] Lord
[1948.94 → 1951.54] so
[1951.54 → 1952.32] Lord
[1952.32 → 1953.98] Lord
[1953.98 → 1954.18] tell you
[1954.18 → 1958.22] in
[1958.64 → 1958.66] how to welcome
[1958.78 → 1959.60] and
[1959.60 → 1961.20] this
[1961.22 → 1961.52] may
[1961.78 → 1962.10] come
[1962.10 → 1962.38] to
