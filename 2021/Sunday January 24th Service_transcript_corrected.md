[0.00 → 7.06] Well, good morning, Hope.
[7.42 → 12.64] It is good to be together and gather around the Word, as Dave Lower said, in our homes
[12.64 → 18.02] and sit with the Word and be transformed by the Word who is Christ among us by His Spirit
[18.02 → 18.60] this morning.
[19.18 → 23.58] We're going to continue our series on Apprenticing with Jesus where we are looking at and exploring
[23.58 → 29.32] what it is that Jesus invites us as the body of Christ to do and to be when He says to
[29.32 → 31.10] all of us, follow me.
[31.88 → 33.78] I speak on behalf of Pastor Sid as well.
[34.52 → 38.78] When we're encouraged, a number of weeks in a row now we get texts and emails from you
[38.78 → 42.26] just sharing how this series is speaking into some parts of your life and your family's
[42.26 → 45.94] life, and we just encourage you, feel free to keep sharing that, not just with us but with
[45.94 → 46.92] other people in the church.
[47.36 → 50.82] We are journeying together in Apprenticeship, and I'm encouraged to see the way that we're
[50.82 → 53.92] being sparked by the Spirit as we preach through this series.
[53.92 → 59.98] It might be helpful for me to say just a couple words about this series as we think about what
[59.98 → 61.02] we're trying to do overall.
[61.18 → 66.26] This is not a series where we are just doing some self-help tweaking on our spiritual life,
[66.32 → 69.56] where we give a few pieces of advice on how to build a better spiritual life.
[70.10 → 74.78] Nor is it a series where we tell you how to get your act together as a Christian so that
[74.78 → 76.02] God will like you more.
[76.02 → 82.90] This is a series where we are learning from Jesus, his lifestyle, his teaching, his practices
[82.90 → 89.04] that he gives us in his word and in his life so that we can live into the identity he gives
[89.04 → 91.02] us by his death and resurrection.
[91.96 → 96.74] Moreover, we recognize, and I hope you hear this week after week, that all the growth, all
[96.74 → 101.34] the transformation, all the maturity we experience as a church is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[102.12 → 104.06] That's what we're after throughout this series.
[104.06 → 107.98] And this morning, we're going to look not just how Jesus invites us to be with him as
[107.98 → 111.58] his apprentices, not just how we are called to be like him in our character, but to actually
[111.58 → 117.18] do what he did to take our part in the biblical story and join in his mission.
[117.70 → 122.32] And to that end, I do invite you to turn with me to Mark chapter 1 and Mark chapter 3.
[122.40 → 123.92] Just kind of have your thumb on the page.
[124.32 → 126.40] I'm going to read two stories from this gospel.
[129.46 → 132.50] Beginning with Jesus announcing the good news of the kingdom.
[134.06 → 135.94] Mark chapter 1, 14.
[135.94 → 141.88] After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the good news of God.
[142.08 → 143.62] The time has come, he said.
[143.96 → 145.74] The kingdom of God has come near.
[146.12 → 148.64] Repent and believe in the good news.
[149.62 → 153.88] As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a
[153.88 → 155.64] net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
[155.64 → 158.42] Come, follow me, Jesus said.
[158.64 → 161.52] And I will send you out to fish for people.
[162.52 → 164.48] At once they left their nets and followed him.
[165.04 → 169.12] When he had gone a little farther, he saw James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John in a boat
[169.12 → 170.24] preparing their nets.
[170.90 → 172.20] Without delay, he called them.
[172.32 → 176.64] And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
[177.58 → 182.22] And Jesus begins his public ministry, healing, teaching, casting out demons.
[182.22 → 187.46] A crowd gathers, and then we jump down to chapter 3, verse 13, and we read this.
[188.26 → 193.82] Jesus went up on a mountainside, called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
[194.44 → 198.82] He appointed 12 that they may be with him and that he might send them out to preach
[198.82 → 200.96] and have authority to drive out demons.
[201.80 → 203.10] These are the 12 he appointed.
[203.92 → 205.66] Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter.
[206.26 → 208.50] James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
[208.50 → 214.18] To them, he gave the name Boanerges, the best name in the Bible, free for the taking to young parents,
[214.60 → 216.08] which means sons of thunder.
[216.60 → 223.32] Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, son of Alpheus, Thaddeus, Simon the Zealot,
[223.56 → 226.06] and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
[226.98 → 227.94] We'll leave it there.
[227.94 → 237.76] If you were a Christian teen growing up in the late 1990s and the early 2000s,
[237.82 → 239.74] you will know what this acronym means.
[239.80 → 240.12] Are you ready?
[242.24 → 242.76] WWJD.
[244.32 → 245.86] What would Jesus do?
[245.92 → 248.12] I bet you a number of you knew it right away before I even finished.
[248.52 → 252.34] I remember going to a Christian conference, a convention as a teenager,
[252.62 → 256.00] and they were handing out these WWJD bracelets on the way in.
[256.00 → 258.08] And there's lots of people wearing shirts with that on it.
[258.16 → 260.86] The message that day was on what would Jesus do.
[260.96 → 264.02] And I learned later, actually, there's a whole movie called What Would Jesus Do?
[264.08 → 268.76] It was a very popular movement in the evangelical world in the 90s and early 2000s.
[269.52 → 275.00] And, of course, the logic of it was that you sort of put this bracelet on or whatever paraphernalia,
[275.08 → 278.98] and it's a way of reminding yourself in moments of discernment or moments of temptation
[278.98 → 284.60] to ask, okay, what would Jesus do at this moment?
[284.94 → 286.28] Would he send that text?
[286.94 → 288.82] Would he watch this movie?
[288.94 → 292.90] Would he, or in my case, would he drive this fast in the 400 highway
[292.90 → 296.42] with your bracelet firmly in view as you hold the steering wheel?
[296.88 → 297.82] What would Jesus do?
[297.82 → 302.92] Now, it's sort of a trite, cliché phrase that we hear in our world.
[303.42 → 306.72] And if I would modify it, I'd probably do what Dallas Willard does,
[306.76 → 309.14] where he says a better question is to ask,
[309.54 → 312.86] what kind of life would Jesus live if Jesus lived my life?
[313.04 → 313.64] But I get it.
[313.68 → 315.80] That question doesn't fit on a bracelet nearly as well,
[315.84 → 317.26] and the acronym is way too long.
[317.68 → 320.22] But what Dallas Willard is trying to do is widen the scope
[320.22 → 322.98] to see that we want to live the kind of life,
[323.04 → 324.50] have the lifestyle that Jesus has,
[324.50 → 328.32] such that in moments of decision, we do what Jesus did.
[329.30 → 332.02] But the inside of the bracelet is the simple genius
[332.02 → 335.36] that we actually can do what Jesus did.
[336.66 → 338.80] And I want us to hear again this morning
[338.80 → 340.94] that when Jesus invites us into apprenticeship,
[341.66 → 345.44] when the call goes out to the church today to follow him,
[345.94 → 349.40] he assumes that part of what that call is
[349.40 → 352.60] is to continue his ministry, to do what he did,
[352.60 → 354.60] or to use the image we started with in this series,
[354.86 → 357.76] like someone who's teaching an apprenticeship program on framing.
[358.24 → 360.50] He not only teaches us how to pick up the two by four,
[360.62 → 361.78] make the measure, make the cut,
[361.96 → 363.72] he also assumes that we're going to do that,
[363.86 → 365.22] we're going to measure it, we're going to make the cut,
[365.28 → 367.08] and we're going to frame the house.
[367.72 → 369.46] We're going to do what Jesus did.
[369.86 → 370.96] And I want to ask,
[371.88 → 373.52] do you see your apprenticeship with Jesus
[373.52 → 376.90] in that kind of way of following in his steps,
[377.14 → 378.86] not just listening, not just watching,
[378.86 → 382.72] but doing the very things that Jesus of Nazareth did?
[384.22 → 386.30] And I ask this question because I happen to think
[386.30 → 388.46] that it's easy for us to read the Gospels today
[388.46 → 392.64] as amazing biographies of things Jesus did,
[393.42 → 394.44] healings he performed,
[394.86 → 397.56] wisdom he announced as he taught on the Sermon on the Mount,
[398.12 → 400.50] miracles he performed, forgiveness he extended,
[400.60 → 402.40] and we marvel at these things as we should,
[402.54 → 403.44] but we stop there.
[403.44 → 405.96] And we never stop to ask,
[406.46 → 408.10] what else happens in the Gospels?
[408.34 → 410.44] Forgetting that so much of what Jesus does
[410.44 → 412.02] in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
[412.02 → 413.68] is gathered a community to himself,
[414.62 → 417.04] pour his time into their hearts, their lives,
[417.14 → 419.86] invite them with him into the homes of sinners,
[420.42 → 422.66] invite them to participate in the miracles,
[422.80 → 424.42] handing out the bread and the fish
[424.42 → 426.10] on the mountainsides to the crowds
[426.10 → 429.36] so that they can start to do what he did.
[430.02 → 430.92] More than that,
[430.92 → 432.62] this same Jesus then dies,
[432.76 → 433.88] breaking the power of sin,
[434.22 → 435.18] rises to life,
[435.38 → 436.62] and he pours out the Spirit
[436.62 → 438.56] precisely so that these disciples
[438.56 → 440.52] have his power and his authority
[440.52 → 442.64] to follow in what he began
[442.64 → 444.68] in this kingdom mission.
[446.10 → 448.40] It seems to me that there's work to do
[448.40 → 449.12] in the church today,
[449.22 → 450.34] our church today,
[450.76 → 454.78] in recovering Jesus as Lord and Saviour and Teacher.
[455.56 → 457.42] Before Jesus goes to the cross
[457.42 → 458.46] at the end of the Gospels,
[458.46 → 460.04] there are these three years
[460.04 → 462.00] that all the Gospels narrate
[462.00 → 463.96] of Jesus teaching his disciples,
[465.02 → 466.34] inviting them into homes
[466.34 → 468.58] as he breaks bread without casts,
[469.46 → 470.54] inviting them to be there
[470.54 → 471.78] as he touches a leper
[471.78 → 473.00] and brings healing,
[473.94 → 474.84] inviting them to be there
[474.84 → 478.00] as he enjoys and builds friendship
[478.00 → 480.18] with the poor and the margins of society,
[481.26 → 482.70] inviting them to join him
[482.70 → 484.86] as he opposes the proud
[484.86 → 486.20] and the religious leaders
[486.20 → 488.22] who have twisted and distorted the Scriptures,
[489.20 → 490.12] inviting them with him
[490.12 → 492.54] as he actually walks away from the crowd
[492.54 → 494.14] to go to a solitary place
[494.14 → 495.68] to pray to be with the Father,
[496.74 → 497.42] inviting them with him
[497.42 → 498.90] to practice Sabbath,
[500.06 → 502.28] to enjoy life together,
[502.36 → 503.98] and in all of these things,
[504.08 → 504.94] throughout his teaching,
[505.08 → 506.00] throughout his time with them,
[506.26 → 508.32] goes out and weaves through the call,
[509.26 → 510.58] follow me.
[510.58 → 516.96] At the outset of the Gospel of Mark,
[517.76 → 519.02] he wants to show
[519.02 → 521.48] that the practice of discipleship,
[521.58 → 522.70] the apprenticeship to which
[522.70 → 524.56] these young early disciples
[524.56 → 526.14] are invited into is active.
[526.56 → 527.90] It's not passive observance
[527.90 → 528.96] of just something Jesus does,
[529.12 → 530.08] it's something that pulls them
[530.08 → 531.70] right into it with the whole of their lives.
[531.96 → 533.78] And as you saw in Mark chapter 1,
[534.32 → 535.82] Jesus is walking on the side
[535.82 → 536.72] of the Sea of Galilee,
[536.84 → 538.60] he sees Simon and his brother Andrew
[538.60 → 539.66] and he says, follow me.
[540.50 → 541.26] We know that phrase.
[541.34 → 542.38] What's the next phrase?
[542.80 → 546.24] And I'm going to send you out, fishermen,
[547.30 → 549.64] to be fishers of men,
[550.08 → 550.82] to fish for people.
[551.28 → 552.28] And of course, half of us right now,
[552.32 → 552.80] as I say that,
[552.82 → 553.92] are imagining that little song
[553.92 → 554.90] that we sing to our kids,
[555.32 → 556.86] I will make you.
[557.32 → 558.40] You finish it off.
[558.86 → 560.32] But before it was a trite phrase
[560.32 → 561.10] in our era,
[561.20 → 562.16] when Jesus speaks it,
[562.20 → 563.98] it's actually a massive calling
[563.98 → 565.38] into mission over the lives
[565.38 → 565.92] of his disciples
[565.92 → 567.10] and all those who become
[567.10 → 568.14] Jesus' apprentices later.
[568.60 → 569.28] It's a way of saying,
[569.64 → 570.38] you, fishermen,
[570.50 → 571.22] are going to become people
[571.22 → 572.60] who invite others
[572.60 → 573.72] into apprenticeship with Jesus.
[574.04 → 574.94] Through your actions,
[575.10 → 575.80] through your words,
[575.92 → 577.12] through your life in the cities,
[577.48 → 578.54] you are going to make
[578.54 → 579.70] the kingdom of God known
[579.70 → 581.42] through all that you do
[581.42 → 582.70] as my apprentices.
[584.16 → 585.28] And I'm struck by how,
[585.42 → 585.96] from the beginning,
[586.06 → 587.48] there's no gap between believing
[587.48 → 588.66] and growing in faith
[588.66 → 589.68] and discipling in mission.
[589.90 → 591.40] It's all together.
[591.54 → 592.12] From the beginning,
[592.42 → 593.18] you're my disciple,
[593.50 → 594.06] follow me,
[594.40 → 595.26] make known the kingdom
[595.26 → 597.12] in word and in deed.
[598.92 → 600.22] I'm struck by that in part
[600.22 → 601.16] because I think today
[601.16 → 603.10] we have a lot of confused thoughts
[603.10 → 604.42] about apprenticeship,
[605.26 → 605.96] about Christianity,
[606.64 → 608.66] and the sort of low-bar assumption
[608.66 → 609.52] that to be a Christian
[609.52 → 610.44] is to maybe show up
[610.44 → 612.28] to church twice a month.
[612.34 → 613.60] I think that's the average now.
[614.02 → 615.04] To maybe give money
[615.04 → 615.94] when you feel compelled
[615.94 → 617.42] or you hear an interesting sermon
[617.42 → 618.68] or to hear stories
[618.68 → 620.04] of other Christians doing things
[620.04 → 620.62] and we just think
[620.62 → 622.04] that's kind of the way it is.
[622.78 → 623.96] Then we read Jesus' call
[623.96 → 624.58] and his disciples
[624.58 → 625.58] and much more
[625.58 → 627.18] about his apprenticing with them.
[627.28 → 628.72] We realize that so much
[628.72 → 629.84] of a bigger call
[629.84 → 632.08] is on their lives and ours.
[632.98 → 634.08] And we read more of that
[634.08 → 634.98] in even Mark 3.
[635.04 → 636.06] I want to read it again for us
[636.06 → 636.68] the first half.
[637.54 → 639.04] Jesus went on a mountainside
[639.04 → 640.12] and he called to him
[640.12 → 640.84] those he wanted
[640.84 → 641.92] and they came to him.
[642.34 → 643.20] He appointed 12
[643.20 → 644.30] that they might be with him
[644.30 → 645.98] and he might send them out.
[646.20 → 646.82] Hear it again.
[647.10 → 648.58] To preach and to have authority
[648.58 → 650.36] to drive out demons.
[650.36 → 650.56] Christians.
[651.48 → 652.42] And then Mark lists off
[652.42 → 653.32] and Matthew does this too.
[653.64 → 654.68] This motley crew
[654.68 → 656.30] of early followers of Jesus
[656.30 → 657.02] who are going to be
[657.02 → 658.30] his first apprentices.
[659.12 → 659.92] And I'm struck by the way
[659.92 → 661.26] by this crowd that he picks.
[661.36 → 663.18] He's picking a zealot
[663.18 → 664.92] who probably carried a sword.
[665.58 → 667.30] He picked a Roman collaborator
[667.30 → 668.14] who was a tax collector
[668.14 → 669.30] one of the most hated people.
[669.72 → 670.62] He picks fishermen
[670.62 → 671.62] ordinary folk
[671.62 → 672.58] and of course Judas
[672.58 → 674.18] one who's going to betray him.
[674.52 → 675.36] And I can't help but think
[675.36 → 676.36] one of their first tasks
[676.36 → 676.88] as disciples
[676.88 → 678.00] is just to get along.
[678.36 → 679.20] Don't kill each other.
[679.20 → 680.30] I picture Simon
[680.30 → 681.16] with his sword
[681.16 → 682.36] seeing Matthew
[682.36 → 683.06] the tax collector
[683.06 → 683.86] saying I don't think
[683.86 → 684.84] we could be in the same room.
[685.10 → 686.66] You work for the Roman Empire.
[687.10 → 687.76] And then Jesus saying
[687.76 → 689.22] let's learn how to love one another
[689.22 → 691.40] and serve the kingdom of God together.
[693.16 → 694.44] Now a lot is happening
[694.44 → 695.22] in this passage
[695.22 → 696.44] and scholars are quick
[696.44 → 696.96] to point out
[696.96 → 697.96] that this story actually
[697.96 → 699.54] pulls in the Old Testament story.
[699.66 → 700.30] We don't see this
[700.30 → 701.22] with our modern eyes
[701.22 → 702.30] but I want us to see
[702.30 → 703.48] how Jesus going
[703.48 → 704.30] on the mountainside
[704.30 → 705.60] actually connects right back
[705.60 → 706.56] to the Old Testament story
[706.56 → 707.04] of Israel.
[707.04 → 707.16] Israel.
[707.66 → 708.88] Another mountainside
[708.88 → 711.22] where another group of 12
[711.22 → 711.76] is gathered
[711.76 → 713.34] after an amazing moment
[713.34 → 714.24] of redemption.
[714.90 → 715.62] You know what it is?
[717.58 → 718.48] The Red Sea.
[718.98 → 719.96] God rescuing Israel
[719.96 → 721.26] pulling them through the Red Sea
[721.26 → 722.96] and bringing them to Mount Sinai
[722.96 → 724.06] and Moses is there
[724.06 → 725.30] in the presence of God
[725.30 → 726.04] over the mountain
[726.04 → 728.18] and all the 12 tribes of Israel
[728.18 → 728.68] are there
[728.68 → 730.20] hearing God's instructions
[730.20 → 731.58] on how they are to be
[731.58 → 732.40] his people.
[732.78 → 733.92] And we read specifically
[733.92 → 735.64] in Exodus 19, 5 and 6
[735.64 → 736.52] God saying to them
[736.52 → 737.76] of all the nations
[737.76 → 738.60] of this world
[738.60 → 740.56] I'm bringing you to myself
[740.56 → 741.74] as a special possession
[741.74 → 743.24] so that you can be
[743.24 → 743.80] identity
[743.80 → 745.56] a kingdom of priests.
[746.08 → 747.48] So that you can mediate
[747.48 → 748.20] my love
[748.20 → 749.08] and my blessing
[749.08 → 750.74] to all the peoples
[750.74 → 751.26] of the earth.
[752.00 → 752.84] That's why he calls him
[752.84 → 753.26] to himself.
[753.52 → 754.46] And now we have Jesus
[754.46 → 755.58] on a mountainside
[755.58 → 756.94] sort of the new Moses
[756.94 → 758.38] and we have the new 12
[758.38 → 759.36] on the mountainside
[759.36 → 759.90] with Jesus
[759.90 → 760.76] and him saying
[760.76 → 761.98] here's the authority
[761.98 → 762.82] I'm giving you
[762.82 → 764.14] to bring forth
[764.14 → 765.08] and bear witness
[765.08 → 766.26] to the kingdom
[766.26 → 766.94] of God.
[767.70 → 768.88] The rule of Christ
[768.88 → 770.12] that's going to peel back
[770.12 → 771.02] the power of sin
[771.02 → 772.24] and bring healing
[772.24 → 772.86] and redemption
[772.86 → 774.24] to the whole of creation.
[775.12 → 776.04] That's what's happening
[776.04 → 776.76] in this passage.
[777.44 → 778.86] And he's giving them
[778.86 → 779.60] the authority
[779.60 → 781.48] to cast out demons
[781.48 → 784.22] and do what he did.
[785.80 → 786.86] Now if you read
[786.86 → 788.22] Matthew's gospel
[788.22 → 789.10] in chapter 10
[789.10 → 791.10] Matthew actually elaborates
[791.10 → 792.48] on this passage
[792.48 → 793.42] quite intriguingly.
[793.46 → 793.88] He writes
[793.88 → 794.90] as you go
[794.90 → 795.84] same commissioning
[795.84 → 797.28] proclaim this message
[797.28 → 798.36] the kingdom of heaven
[798.36 → 799.00] is near
[799.00 → 800.24] heal the sick
[800.24 → 802.04] raise the dead
[802.04 → 803.78] cleanse those
[803.78 → 804.66] who have leprosy
[804.66 → 805.90] drive out demons
[805.90 → 807.02] and then freely
[807.02 → 807.88] you have received
[807.88 → 809.84] freely give.
[811.32 → 812.12] Now I would love
[812.12 → 812.74] to have been there
[812.74 → 813.54] on the mountainside
[813.54 → 814.14] with the disciples
[814.14 → 815.72] to see the reaction
[815.72 → 817.00] to this kind of commissioning.
[817.28 → 818.24] No doubt some of them
[818.24 → 819.24] had some sense
[819.24 → 819.76] of what Jesus
[819.76 → 820.52] might be up to
[820.52 → 821.32] but I don't think
[821.32 → 821.92] any of them
[821.92 → 822.52] had a clue
[822.52 → 823.92] that when they signed up
[823.92 → 824.72] to follow Jesus
[824.72 → 826.38] this was on the agenda
[826.38 → 827.40] for what they were
[827.40 → 828.06] supposed to do.
[828.64 → 829.02] And I picture
[829.02 → 829.56] some of them saying
[829.56 → 831.02] did you say that right?
[831.64 → 832.26] Okay preaching
[832.26 → 833.34] sharing speaking
[833.34 → 834.94] okay heal the sick
[834.94 → 836.52] cleanse the lepers
[836.52 → 838.24] raise the dead
[838.24 → 840.20] that's on our agenda
[840.20 → 841.38] our job description
[841.38 → 842.26] as apprentices
[842.26 → 843.94] yes.
[846.70 → 847.88] And I like how Jesus
[847.88 → 848.84] finishes that commission
[848.84 → 849.44] there by saying
[849.44 → 850.70] freely you've received
[850.70 → 852.56] freely give.
[853.10 → 854.14] I'm pouring myself
[854.14 → 854.60] into you
[854.60 → 855.24] I'm teaching you
[855.24 → 855.96] I'm instructing you
[855.96 → 856.92] I'm showing you
[856.92 → 857.66] what it looks like
[857.66 → 858.44] to live as citizens
[858.44 → 858.96] of the kingdom
[858.96 → 860.70] now freely share it.
[861.02 → 862.08] Don't monetize it
[862.08 → 862.58] now that you have
[862.58 → 863.08] this power
[863.08 → 864.40] as many try to do.
[864.94 → 866.28] Don't try to hide it
[866.28 → 867.14] as many feel
[867.14 → 868.10] tempted to do.
[868.78 → 869.86] Share the news
[869.86 → 871.18] that the king has come
[871.18 → 872.18] and the kingdom
[872.18 → 873.00] has broken
[873.00 → 873.86] into our reality.
[875.44 → 876.02] And the rest
[876.02 → 876.48] of the story
[876.48 → 877.18] of the gospels
[877.18 → 878.58] and especially
[878.58 → 879.52] the story of Acts
[879.52 → 880.48] and the letters
[880.48 → 881.20] to the churches
[881.20 → 882.54] in Asia Minor
[882.54 → 882.92] then
[882.92 → 884.58] is stories
[884.58 → 885.20] of the church
[885.20 → 886.40] doing what Jesus
[886.40 → 886.76] did.
[887.26 → 888.34] Learning in his ways
[888.34 → 889.58] practicing to live
[889.58 → 890.20] his lifestyle
[890.20 → 891.50] and slowly but surely
[891.50 → 893.28] experiencing the power
[893.28 → 893.96] and the authority
[893.96 → 894.38] of Jesus
[894.38 → 895.22] by his resurrection
[895.22 → 895.90] and the spirit
[895.90 → 897.62] working through them
[897.62 → 899.64] to do what Jesus did.
[900.36 → 901.32] And I want to pause
[901.32 → 902.06] and just marvel
[902.06 → 903.04] with you for a moment
[903.04 → 904.38] at how it's always
[904.38 → 905.38] the case in the Bible
[905.38 → 906.54] that when God
[906.54 → 907.86] sets out his plan
[907.86 → 909.50] to accomplish salvation
[909.50 → 910.14] for his world
[910.14 → 910.64] and his people
[910.64 → 911.96] he always works
[911.96 → 912.64] through a people.
[913.54 → 914.04] Maybe that's
[914.04 → 915.06] normal information
[915.06 → 915.26] to you
[915.26 → 915.92] maybe that's new
[915.92 → 916.52] to you
[916.52 → 917.48] but think about this
[917.48 → 917.70] for a minute.
[917.76 → 918.28] In the Old Testament
[918.28 → 919.54] he wants to bring
[919.54 → 920.58] redemption to his people
[920.58 → 921.58] here's Israel
[921.58 → 922.64] you're sent to the nations.
[922.76 → 923.36] In the New Testament
[923.36 → 923.72] Jesus
[923.72 → 924.82] he's bringing out
[924.82 → 925.24] the kingdom.
[925.34 → 925.74] What does he do?
[925.84 → 927.36] Brings 12 ordinary people
[927.36 → 927.72] and he says
[927.72 → 928.64] through you
[928.64 → 929.50] I'm going to make known
[929.50 → 929.92] the kingdom.
[929.92 → 931.66] I remember
[931.66 → 932.58] sitting in a class
[932.58 → 933.40] with Charles Ringma
[933.40 → 934.34] at Regent College
[934.34 → 935.34] and Charles Ringma
[935.34 → 936.14] was teaching on how
[936.14 → 936.86] God always seems
[936.86 → 937.58] to call a people
[937.58 → 938.46] and work through a people
[938.46 → 939.04] in his mission
[939.04 → 939.44] and he says
[939.44 → 940.32] if I were God
[940.32 → 942.10] I would never do that.
[943.14 → 944.52] I would never pick
[944.52 → 945.16] ordinary
[945.16 → 946.30] messy
[946.30 → 947.60] complicated
[947.60 → 949.64] unreliable humans
[949.64 → 951.34] to move forward
[951.34 → 951.98] the mission
[951.98 → 954.14] but God does
[954.14 → 955.72] and he brings
[955.72 → 956.76] these 12 ordinary
[956.76 → 957.66] disciples to him
[957.66 → 958.88] and he sends them
[958.88 → 959.90] out with his authority
[959.90 → 961.40] to do what he does
[961.40 → 962.40] and we see in the book
[962.40 → 962.72] of Acts
[962.72 → 963.76] that very thing
[963.76 → 965.32] learning to live
[965.32 → 966.10] his kingdom way
[966.10 → 967.34] learning to practice
[967.34 → 968.14] what he taught them
[968.14 → 969.96] doing what he did
[969.96 → 971.28] and two authors
[971.28 → 971.88] that I read
[971.88 → 972.80] in the last couple of weeks
[972.80 → 973.62] have suggested
[973.62 → 974.40] there's definitely
[974.40 → 975.80] a slow progression
[975.80 → 976.30] for them.
[976.66 → 977.50] This is not an overnight
[977.50 → 978.38] thing where they receive
[978.38 → 979.16] the spirit and boom
[979.16 → 980.04] they know what they're doing
[980.04 → 982.02] it's slowly figuring out
[982.02 → 983.42] how they step forward
[983.42 → 984.00] in obedience
[984.00 → 985.48] and practice the way
[985.48 → 985.96] of Christ
[985.96 → 987.50] and maybe it started
[987.50 → 988.84] with just holding a basket
[988.84 → 989.44] and Jesus saying
[989.44 → 990.38] I'll do the miracle
[990.38 → 991.50] you just hold out
[991.50 → 991.92] the food
[991.92 → 993.16] hand out the food
[993.16 → 993.96] to the people
[993.96 → 994.46] that have come
[994.46 → 995.02] to hear me teach
[995.02 → 995.94] you just pass out
[995.94 → 996.50] the baskets
[996.50 → 997.30] I'll take care
[997.30 → 997.84] of the miracle
[997.84 → 999.42] then slowly he says
[999.42 → 1000.16] okay now I want you
[1000.16 → 1000.88] to go to this home
[1000.88 → 1001.98] I want you to share
[1001.98 → 1002.34] a meal
[1002.34 → 1003.72] with people you
[1003.72 → 1004.68] considered unclean
[1004.68 → 1005.38] two years ago
[1005.38 → 1006.66] now I want you
[1006.66 → 1007.42] to go up to a city
[1007.42 → 1007.84] to the north
[1007.84 → 1008.34] that hasn't even
[1008.34 → 1009.12] heard about the kingdom
[1009.12 → 1010.00] and I want you
[1010.00 → 1010.64] to preach
[1010.64 → 1011.68] to people who need
[1011.68 → 1012.62] to hear this good news
[1012.62 → 1014.24] now I want you
[1014.24 → 1016.14] to love the poor
[1016.14 → 1016.72] in your city
[1016.72 → 1018.26] find ways to care
[1018.26 → 1018.72] for them
[1018.72 → 1019.94] and build family
[1019.94 → 1020.46] with them
[1020.46 → 1021.78] and slowly but surely
[1021.78 → 1022.54] these disciples
[1022.54 → 1025.02] learned to do it
[1025.02 → 1026.64] not on their own strength
[1026.64 → 1027.72] not by their own power
[1027.72 → 1028.98] but slowly but surely
[1028.98 → 1030.40] by the love of Christ
[1030.40 → 1030.86] through the work
[1030.86 → 1031.34] of the spirit
[1031.34 → 1032.52] with his authority
[1032.52 → 1033.56] they did it
[1033.56 → 1035.38] and I can imagine
[1035.38 → 1036.46] many times
[1036.46 → 1038.06] them coming together
[1038.06 → 1039.40] after ministry
[1039.40 → 1040.34] in different cities
[1040.34 → 1041.04] over the months
[1041.04 → 1041.44] saying
[1041.44 → 1042.40] the kingdom
[1042.40 → 1044.30] really has come
[1044.30 → 1046.32] we prayed for her
[1046.32 → 1047.50] and she was healed
[1047.50 → 1049.40] we prayed for that
[1049.40 → 1050.22] demon possessed man
[1050.22 → 1051.32] and he was freed
[1051.32 → 1053.50] we spent time
[1053.50 → 1054.10] with these people
[1054.10 → 1054.76] who we didn't think
[1054.76 → 1055.50] would even care
[1055.50 → 1055.98] about the kingdom
[1055.98 → 1057.44] and they want to learn more
[1057.44 → 1059.34] the kingdom of God
[1059.34 → 1060.32] is here
[1060.32 → 1061.42] the authority
[1061.42 → 1062.74] with which Jesus spoke of
[1062.74 → 1063.92] is actually present
[1063.92 → 1064.92] working and operating
[1064.92 → 1065.60] through these
[1065.60 → 1066.90] ordinary disciples
[1066.90 → 1070.80] now I realize
[1070.80 → 1072.12] at least I think
[1072.12 → 1073.16] this is how some of you
[1073.16 → 1073.74] might be thinking
[1073.74 → 1075.16] when you read Matthew 10
[1075.16 → 1077.06] or Mark chapter 3
[1077.06 → 1078.24] and you hear that
[1078.24 → 1079.36] Jesus calls these disciples
[1079.36 → 1079.90] to himself
[1079.90 → 1080.80] he sends them out
[1080.80 → 1081.56] to preach the gospel
[1081.56 → 1082.54] gives them authority
[1082.54 → 1083.86] to cast out demons
[1083.86 → 1084.60] you might be thinking
[1084.60 → 1085.16] to yourself
[1085.16 → 1086.74] okay Dave
[1086.74 → 1089.18] I don't preach the gospel
[1089.18 → 1090.38] in the streets of my city
[1090.38 → 1093.24] I've never cast out
[1093.24 → 1093.62] a demon
[1093.62 → 1094.72] or considered it
[1094.72 → 1096.34] am I an apprentice
[1096.34 → 1098.56] did I miss the boat
[1098.56 → 1099.76] of discipleship
[1099.76 → 1100.44] and I think it's worth
[1100.44 → 1101.70] just making a couple of points
[1101.70 → 1102.92] on this question
[1102.92 → 1103.94] number one
[1103.94 → 1105.12] Mark chapter 3
[1105.12 → 1106.64] is not the exhaustive summary
[1106.64 → 1107.94] of all that apprenticeship is
[1107.94 → 1109.68] it's the whole of Jesus
[1109.68 → 1110.42] lifestyle
[1110.42 → 1112.12] all the ways he taught them
[1112.12 → 1113.32] that's supposed to be embodied
[1113.32 → 1114.26] by the whole community
[1114.26 → 1114.74] of faith
[1114.74 → 1115.58] in a city
[1115.58 → 1117.12] it's not just casting out demons
[1117.12 → 1118.08] it's not just preaching
[1118.08 → 1119.18] in the public square
[1119.18 → 1119.86] in each city
[1119.86 → 1121.36] it's much more exhaustive
[1121.36 → 1121.66] than that
[1121.66 → 1122.50] but secondly
[1122.50 → 1123.82] and this is important to say
[1123.82 → 1125.60] it is not expected
[1125.60 → 1127.38] that every apprentice
[1127.38 → 1127.94] of Jesus
[1127.94 → 1128.96] is going to be
[1128.96 → 1129.88] a street evangelist
[1129.88 → 1131.70] or cast out demons
[1131.70 → 1133.54] and I lean heavily
[1133.54 → 1134.10] right now
[1134.10 → 1135.32] on 1 Corinthians 12
[1135.32 → 1135.96] where it talks about
[1135.96 → 1137.08] the gifts of Christ
[1137.08 → 1137.92] being distributed
[1137.92 → 1138.96] among the body
[1138.96 → 1141.06] in the parts
[1141.06 → 1141.66] in the ways
[1141.66 → 1142.54] that God sees fit
[1142.54 → 1143.58] so that all the gifts
[1143.58 → 1144.08] are operating
[1144.08 → 1144.90] to build up the church
[1144.90 → 1145.86] and to bless the city
[1145.86 → 1147.26] and some will
[1147.26 → 1148.58] hear me clearly on this
[1148.58 → 1149.54] some will
[1149.54 → 1150.34] be able to pray
[1150.34 → 1151.24] and cast out demons
[1151.24 → 1152.72] believe me
[1152.72 → 1154.44] some will be able to pray
[1154.44 → 1155.34] intercessory prayers
[1155.34 → 1156.24] where God is speaking
[1156.24 → 1157.90] in very specific ways
[1157.90 → 1159.34] some will have
[1159.34 → 1160.44] the gifts of hospitality
[1160.44 → 1161.52] and all the rest
[1161.52 → 1162.12] but those gifts
[1162.12 → 1162.64] are distributed
[1162.64 → 1163.66] among the body
[1163.66 → 1164.64] and it's not that
[1164.64 → 1165.38] every disciple
[1165.38 → 1165.88] is expected
[1165.88 → 1166.82] to drive out demons
[1166.82 → 1169.28] however
[1169.28 → 1171.60] every single apprentice
[1171.60 → 1173.48] that joins
[1173.48 → 1174.40] in Jesus'
[1175.00 → 1176.02] apprenticeship program
[1176.02 → 1177.52] is sent
[1177.52 → 1179.26] is given
[1179.26 → 1180.08] his authority
[1180.08 → 1181.16] and sent
[1181.16 → 1182.18] to make known
[1182.18 → 1183.06] the rule of Jesus
[1183.06 → 1184.00] and the kingdom of God
[1184.00 → 1184.80] with the whole
[1184.80 → 1185.48] of their life
[1185.48 → 1186.82] that's every apprentice
[1186.82 → 1188.32] and that involves
[1188.32 → 1188.84] speaking
[1188.84 → 1189.84] that involves action
[1189.84 → 1190.66] that involves your work
[1190.66 → 1191.52] that involves your time
[1191.52 → 1192.64] it involves the whole
[1192.64 → 1193.36] of your life
[1193.36 → 1194.78] making the kingdom of God
[1194.78 → 1195.18] known
[1195.18 → 1196.54] in all the time
[1196.54 → 1197.08] he gives you
[1197.08 → 1199.62] and he doesn't send us
[1199.62 → 1200.26] in his own
[1200.26 → 1201.22] in our own power
[1201.22 → 1202.26] doesn't send us to do it
[1202.26 → 1203.60] all by our own insight
[1203.60 → 1204.86] he sends us with his word
[1204.86 → 1206.02] with his authority
[1206.02 → 1206.74] and by the power
[1206.74 → 1207.26] of his spirit
[1207.26 → 1208.10] together
[1208.10 → 1209.28] to make known
[1209.28 → 1209.68] the kingdom
[1209.68 → 1211.20] that call
[1211.20 → 1212.00] is on all
[1212.00 → 1212.86] of our lives
[1212.86 → 1216.12] and if you feel
[1216.12 → 1217.46] maybe after hearing that
[1217.46 → 1219.24] a bit overwhelmed
[1219.24 → 1220.74] that's okay
[1220.74 → 1222.44] I imagine there are
[1222.44 → 1223.46] twelve overwhelmed
[1223.46 → 1223.90] disciples
[1223.90 → 1224.62] on the side
[1224.62 → 1225.16] of that mountain
[1225.16 → 1226.72] some who thought
[1226.72 → 1227.52] I don't know
[1227.52 → 1228.12] if I signed up
[1228.12 → 1228.52] for this
[1228.52 → 1230.00] if you feel inadequate
[1230.00 → 1231.94] join all the characters
[1231.94 → 1233.24] in the biblical story
[1233.24 → 1234.64] who were ill-equipped
[1234.64 → 1235.84] and felt completely
[1235.84 → 1236.60] unable to do
[1236.60 → 1237.18] the very thing
[1237.18 → 1238.12] God called them to do
[1238.12 → 1239.54] and realize with me
[1239.54 → 1240.74] that God
[1240.74 → 1241.14] is the one
[1241.14 → 1241.74] who equips
[1241.74 → 1243.66] you and me
[1243.66 → 1244.38] all of us
[1244.38 → 1245.26] in our ordinariness
[1245.26 → 1245.90] in our weakness
[1245.90 → 1247.30] with all of our quirks
[1247.30 → 1248.78] and worries
[1248.78 → 1249.72] and fears
[1249.72 → 1251.30] he sends us
[1251.30 → 1253.20] to bear witness
[1253.20 → 1254.46] to the kingdom of God
[1254.46 → 1257.68] recognizing that the authority
[1257.68 → 1259.14] is here
[1259.14 → 1260.38] the spirit
[1260.38 → 1261.72] is here
[1261.72 → 1263.42] as I've said many times
[1263.42 → 1264.24] as I talk to people
[1264.24 → 1264.92] who feel isolated
[1264.92 → 1266.08] don't forget
[1266.08 → 1267.12] that the spirit
[1267.12 → 1268.08] of the living God
[1268.08 → 1269.48] is at work in your homes
[1269.48 → 1271.02] it's at work
[1271.02 → 1271.86] in your family
[1271.86 → 1273.34] you may not always see it
[1273.34 → 1274.96] but those who follow Jesus
[1274.96 → 1275.56] have been given
[1275.56 → 1276.36] the gift of the spirit
[1276.36 → 1277.26] and the same power
[1277.26 → 1278.02] that rose Jesus
[1278.02 → 1278.54] from the dead
[1278.54 → 1279.84] is at work in the church
[1279.84 → 1280.74] and in your home
[1280.74 → 1281.56] you can say amen
[1281.56 → 1282.04] to that
[1282.04 → 1284.10] and I want to spend
[1284.10 → 1285.08] the last few minutes
[1285.08 → 1286.02] I have this morning
[1286.02 → 1287.78] talking about
[1287.78 → 1289.36] how we lean into it
[1289.36 → 1291.16] how we practice it
[1291.16 → 1293.02] think with me
[1293.02 → 1293.50] for a minute
[1293.50 → 1294.84] about the beautiful reality
[1294.84 → 1295.72] we live in right now
[1295.72 → 1297.54] Jesus has defeated
[1297.54 → 1298.42] the power of sin
[1298.42 → 1299.08] by the cross
[1299.08 → 1300.20] he rose victorious
[1300.20 → 1300.80] from the grave
[1300.80 → 1302.42] we are by faith
[1302.42 → 1303.30] a new creation
[1303.30 → 1304.38] participating already
[1304.38 → 1304.98] in the life
[1304.98 → 1305.72] that is coming
[1305.72 → 1306.36] we've been given
[1306.36 → 1307.06] the Holy Spirit
[1307.06 → 1308.24] we're free people
[1308.24 → 1309.74] and for the rest
[1309.74 → 1310.42] of your life
[1310.42 → 1311.56] and the rest of my life
[1311.56 → 1312.90] we as a church
[1312.90 → 1314.52] get to learn
[1314.52 → 1314.96] how to live
[1314.96 → 1315.92] as citizens of the kingdom
[1315.92 → 1317.50] baby step
[1317.50 → 1318.32] by baby step
[1318.32 → 1319.14] failure
[1319.14 → 1321.06] working through it together
[1321.06 → 1321.86] praying
[1321.86 → 1322.32] learning
[1322.32 → 1322.88] reading the scriptures
[1322.88 → 1323.80] we get to learn
[1323.80 → 1325.06] how to live
[1325.06 → 1325.66] with the authority
[1325.66 → 1326.58] that Jesus gives us
[1326.58 → 1327.24] to make him known
[1327.24 → 1328.78] for all the time
[1328.78 → 1329.24] we have left
[1329.24 → 1329.96] we just get to be
[1329.96 → 1330.34] apprentices
[1330.34 → 1331.16] who grow
[1331.16 → 1332.08] and learn
[1332.08 → 1332.92] and mature
[1332.92 → 1334.22] and practice
[1334.22 → 1336.22] the things that Jesus did
[1336.22 → 1338.48] I hope that excites you
[1338.48 → 1339.84] and last week
[1339.84 → 1340.62] as Pastor Sid preached
[1340.62 → 1341.32] I was really struck
[1341.32 → 1341.74] by that
[1341.74 → 1343.90] the emphasis he made
[1343.90 → 1344.74] on how we can know
[1344.74 → 1345.46] so much
[1345.46 → 1347.14] and not do it
[1347.14 → 1347.94] and how we have
[1347.94 → 1348.74] this dichotomy
[1348.74 → 1349.66] by what we know
[1349.66 → 1350.40] and what we do
[1350.40 → 1351.90] and I see more and more
[1351.90 → 1352.94] the goal of the church
[1352.94 → 1353.68] and the goal of us
[1353.68 → 1354.34] as a local church
[1354.34 → 1355.78] is to narrow that gap
[1355.78 → 1356.56] and become people
[1356.56 → 1358.14] who just practice
[1358.14 → 1360.10] step forward in faith
[1360.10 → 1361.68] and try to do the things
[1361.68 → 1362.68] that we know
[1362.68 → 1363.38] we're called to do
[1363.38 → 1364.64] practice the lifestyle
[1364.64 → 1365.64] that Jesus embodied
[1365.64 → 1366.28] for us to try
[1366.28 → 1367.84] recognizing that we can
[1367.84 → 1369.30] slowly learn
[1369.30 → 1370.28] and do it
[1370.28 → 1372.18] it doesn't have to stay
[1372.18 → 1372.62] in our head
[1372.62 → 1373.34] we're not just brains
[1373.34 → 1373.86] on a stick
[1373.86 → 1374.64] we are people
[1374.64 → 1375.36] who can actually
[1375.36 → 1376.36] by the spirit of God
[1376.36 → 1377.58] do the things
[1377.58 → 1378.92] that we read about
[1378.92 → 1379.80] in the book of Acts
[1379.80 → 1381.18] do you believe that
[1381.18 → 1382.62] and I don't think
[1382.62 → 1383.16] it's a magical
[1383.16 → 1383.82] overnight thing
[1383.82 → 1384.52] I honestly think
[1384.52 → 1385.50] it's a communal project
[1385.50 → 1386.76] where we take risks
[1386.76 → 1388.00] we step forward in faith
[1388.00 → 1388.72] we know we're called
[1388.72 → 1389.04] to do it
[1389.04 → 1389.88] we make all sorts
[1389.88 → 1390.32] of mistakes
[1390.32 → 1390.98] we don't know
[1390.98 → 1391.60] how we're doing it
[1391.60 → 1392.38] but we work together
[1392.38 → 1393.36] and we slowly grow
[1393.36 → 1395.14] it's a very normal thing
[1395.14 → 1395.76] like you learn
[1395.76 → 1396.92] so many things
[1396.92 → 1398.20] is how we learn
[1398.20 → 1398.86] the way of the kingdom
[1398.86 → 1399.30] of God
[1399.30 → 1402.10] you know I think
[1402.10 → 1403.62] of Kennedy and Zoe
[1403.62 → 1405.12] and Linda Wing
[1405.12 → 1406.26] who serve faithfully
[1406.26 → 1407.08] at the community kitchen
[1407.08 → 1409.16] and have learned
[1409.16 → 1410.42] to love their
[1410.42 → 1411.32] vulnerable neighbours
[1411.32 → 1412.22] in fact Linda said
[1412.22 → 1412.94] to me this week
[1412.94 → 1414.16] that the last two years
[1414.16 → 1415.04] that she's been serving
[1415.04 → 1415.72] and sharing meals
[1415.72 → 1416.60] is transformed
[1416.60 → 1417.86] the way she thinks
[1417.86 → 1418.48] about poverty
[1418.48 → 1419.86] the way she thinks
[1419.86 → 1420.32] about the people
[1420.32 → 1420.86] on the margins
[1420.86 → 1421.98] she is practiced
[1421.98 → 1422.92] and learning
[1422.92 → 1423.64] and growing
[1423.64 → 1424.28] in the way
[1424.28 → 1425.12] of the kingdom
[1425.12 → 1427.98] I think of some
[1427.98 → 1428.34] of the people
[1428.34 → 1429.00] who are in surge
[1429.00 → 1429.48] right now
[1429.48 → 1430.92] who have practiced
[1430.92 → 1432.20] hospitality for years
[1432.20 → 1433.18] and their tables
[1433.18 → 1433.64] are places
[1433.64 → 1434.50] where friends
[1434.50 → 1435.72] strangers
[1435.72 → 1436.94] broken
[1436.94 → 1438.34] strange family members
[1438.34 → 1439.12] are welcome
[1439.12 → 1440.28] and can dine
[1440.28 → 1440.98] in a way
[1440.98 → 1441.50] where the kingdom
[1441.50 → 1442.12] shows up
[1442.12 → 1444.64] I think of many women
[1444.64 → 1445.36] in our church
[1445.36 → 1447.44] who are praying together
[1447.44 → 1449.60] many didn't grow up
[1449.60 → 1450.48] in families of prayer
[1450.48 → 1451.74] not people who consider
[1451.74 → 1452.44] themselves gifted
[1452.44 → 1452.82] in prayer
[1452.82 → 1453.76] but slowly they learn
[1453.76 → 1454.98] to pray boldly
[1454.98 → 1456.18] they pray for the kingdom
[1456.18 → 1456.54] to come
[1456.54 → 1457.44] they pray for healing
[1457.44 → 1457.88] over people
[1457.88 → 1458.70] who are sick with cancer
[1458.70 → 1459.66] they pray for families
[1459.66 → 1460.88] to grow in faith
[1460.88 → 1461.82] for people who are estranged
[1461.82 → 1463.02] to be reconciled
[1463.02 → 1464.44] and slowly they see
[1464.44 → 1465.62] the kingdom break in
[1465.62 → 1467.66] we practice the way
[1467.66 → 1468.70] of the kingdom together
[1468.70 → 1471.28] I think of evangelism
[1471.28 → 1472.38] and again just going back
[1472.38 → 1472.86] to surge
[1472.86 → 1473.62] and the blessed rhythms
[1473.62 → 1474.06] that I know
[1474.06 → 1475.38] that some of our small groups
[1475.38 → 1476.02] also do
[1476.02 → 1477.80] we start by just naming
[1477.80 → 1478.80] the fear we have
[1478.80 → 1480.52] of speaking about our faith
[1480.52 → 1481.84] and it starts with
[1481.84 → 1482.68] just baby steps
[1482.68 → 1484.42] of sharing ordinary ways
[1484.42 → 1485.00] that our faith
[1485.00 → 1485.98] shapes our life
[1485.98 → 1487.42] ordinary relationships
[1487.42 → 1488.00] with our neighbours
[1488.00 → 1489.22] and slowly but surely
[1489.22 → 1490.10] we encourage one another
[1490.10 → 1491.18] we pray for opportunities
[1491.18 → 1492.60] and we get chances
[1492.60 → 1495.62] to speak about the gospel
[1495.62 → 1497.70] and we learn how to do it
[1497.70 → 1499.32] in ways that are normal
[1499.32 → 1501.38] true to who we are
[1501.38 → 1502.70] part of our life
[1502.70 → 1504.24] and actually winsome
[1504.24 → 1505.06] and contextual
[1505.06 → 1505.86] in our neighbourhoods
[1505.86 → 1507.42] we practice
[1507.42 → 1509.06] the way of the kingdom
[1509.06 → 1512.12] I want to finish
[1512.12 → 1512.60] with a story
[1512.60 → 1513.04] that I think
[1513.04 → 1514.24] helps us see
[1514.24 → 1515.46] how this plays out
[1515.46 → 1516.78] it's a story
[1516.78 → 1517.32] from probably
[1517.32 → 1518.18] eight years ago now
[1518.18 → 1518.68] where I went
[1518.68 → 1519.90] on a prayer weekend
[1519.90 → 1520.54] to Bellingham
[1520.54 → 1520.90] it was actually
[1520.90 → 1521.84] a prayer class
[1521.84 → 1522.72] with Regent College
[1522.72 → 1524.28] and a number of us
[1524.28 → 1524.88] drove down there
[1524.88 → 1525.90] and we sat through the day
[1525.90 → 1526.88] on lectures on prayer
[1526.88 → 1527.60] and we learned
[1527.60 → 1528.50] about different traditions
[1528.50 → 1529.02] of prayer
[1529.02 → 1529.72] and then in the evening
[1529.72 → 1531.14] there was a worship service
[1531.14 → 1532.20] and the professor said
[1532.20 → 1532.82] if any of you
[1532.82 → 1533.42] would like prayer
[1533.42 → 1534.72] there's a number of people
[1534.72 → 1535.64] who are gifted intercessors
[1535.64 → 1536.74] who are more than happy
[1536.74 → 1537.40] to pray with you
[1537.40 → 1538.60] for as long as you'd like
[1538.60 → 1539.20] to receive prayer
[1539.20 → 1539.92] and for me
[1539.92 → 1540.54] I was like yes
[1540.54 → 1541.14] I'm tired
[1541.14 → 1541.94] we were just starting
[1541.94 → 1542.52] a young family
[1542.52 → 1543.04] at that time
[1543.04 → 1544.34] I needed discernment
[1544.34 → 1545.32] in my future in ministry
[1545.32 → 1546.66] I was so ready for prayer
[1546.66 → 1547.66] so I stayed as long
[1547.66 → 1548.68] as I needed to
[1548.68 → 1550.14] and I remember standing there
[1550.14 → 1551.32] in this very small
[1551.32 → 1551.96] little church
[1551.96 → 1553.52] and then this guy
[1553.52 → 1554.76] whose name I don't even know
[1554.76 → 1556.24] stood beside me
[1556.24 → 1556.88] I was standing up
[1556.88 → 1558.22] places his hand on my shoulder
[1558.22 → 1559.14] and then places his other hand
[1559.14 → 1559.62] on my chest
[1559.62 → 1560.18] and I was like whoa
[1560.18 → 1561.74] this is not how I grew up to pray
[1561.74 → 1562.44] I don't know you
[1562.44 → 1563.42] you got your hand on my chest
[1563.42 → 1564.58] and then he said
[1564.58 → 1565.32] can I pray for you
[1565.32 → 1566.16] and I said absolutely
[1566.16 → 1568.96] it's the next 20 to 30 minutes
[1568.96 → 1570.62] I heard God speak
[1570.62 → 1571.72] very directly to me
[1571.72 → 1572.62] in ways that I didn't think
[1572.62 → 1573.24] were possible
[1573.24 → 1574.12] before then
[1574.12 → 1576.18] and I felt like
[1576.18 → 1577.44] I was having a conversation
[1577.44 → 1579.04] with the living God
[1579.04 → 1579.94] through this man
[1579.94 → 1580.92] who didn't even know me
[1580.92 → 1582.52] and I walked away
[1582.52 → 1584.44] having communed with God
[1584.44 → 1585.64] through this person's prayer
[1585.64 → 1587.32] it was beautiful
[1587.32 → 1588.56] and I often think
[1588.56 → 1589.64] back to that time of prayer
[1589.64 → 1591.00] but if I could go back
[1591.00 → 1592.04] and talk to this guy
[1592.04 → 1592.58] you know what I want
[1592.58 → 1593.16] to talk about
[1593.16 → 1594.92] I want to talk about
[1594.92 → 1595.62] how he learned
[1595.62 → 1597.66] because I'm sure
[1597.66 → 1598.82] that did not happen overnight
[1598.82 → 1600.78] that gift of intercessory prayer
[1600.78 → 1601.68] of listening for the spirit
[1601.68 → 1602.78] I'm guessing it started
[1602.78 → 1603.48] when he was a kid
[1603.48 → 1604.70] maybe his parents
[1604.70 → 1605.56] taught him how to pray
[1605.56 → 1606.42] simple prayers
[1606.42 → 1607.80] I imagine this
[1607.80 → 1608.34] as a young
[1608.34 → 1608.90] this boy
[1608.90 → 1609.94] sort of having
[1609.94 → 1611.12] a very distracted mind
[1611.12 → 1611.94] going all over the place
[1611.94 → 1613.02] but sometimes having images
[1613.02 → 1613.70] in his head
[1613.70 → 1615.38] thinking a lot's strange
[1615.38 → 1616.76] I picture him perhaps
[1616.76 → 1617.52] in a youth group
[1617.52 → 1618.62] where they're praying
[1618.62 → 1619.26] as students
[1619.26 → 1620.24] and he has a desire
[1620.24 → 1621.16] to speak something
[1621.16 → 1621.50] to someone
[1621.50 → 1622.34] that he's kind of hearing
[1622.34 → 1622.90] as they pray
[1622.90 → 1623.40] and he's still got
[1623.40 → 1624.20] a distracted mind
[1624.20 → 1625.06] and maybe even
[1625.06 → 1625.62] at some point
[1625.62 → 1626.00] as a young adult
[1626.00 → 1626.98] just saying it out loud
[1626.98 → 1628.34] and feeling the weirdness
[1628.34 → 1629.06] and feeling dumb
[1629.06 → 1629.76] for saying things
[1629.76 → 1630.40] that he might be hearing
[1630.40 → 1630.78] in prayer
[1630.78 → 1632.60] slowly over the years
[1632.60 → 1633.66] in the context
[1633.66 → 1634.34] of his family
[1634.34 → 1635.08] and his church
[1635.08 → 1635.78] and other believers
[1635.78 → 1637.42] learning to listen
[1637.42 → 1638.14] to the spirit
[1638.14 → 1639.90] bringing him
[1639.90 → 1640.42] to the point
[1640.42 → 1641.02] where at the age
[1641.02 → 1642.06] of 40 or so
[1642.06 → 1643.56] he prays for this pastor
[1643.56 → 1644.58] and I left
[1644.58 → 1645.34] having spoken
[1645.34 → 1645.94] and listening
[1645.94 → 1646.88] to the very spirit
[1646.88 → 1647.36] of God
[1647.36 → 1649.48] practicing
[1649.48 → 1650.72] the way
[1650.72 → 1651.82] of the kingdom
[1651.82 → 1653.68] and hope
[1653.68 → 1655.06] I want you to hear
[1655.06 → 1656.70] words of encouragement
[1656.70 → 1658.86] that Jesus himself
[1658.86 → 1660.40] has given us
[1660.40 → 1661.42] everything we need
[1661.42 → 1662.44] to live in the kingdom
[1662.44 → 1664.72] to do what he did
[1664.72 → 1665.30] to practice
[1665.30 → 1666.10] what he practiced
[1666.10 → 1667.84] to grow as people
[1667.84 → 1668.54] who live
[1668.54 → 1669.14] in the life
[1669.14 → 1669.62] of the kingdom
[1669.62 → 1670.90] that is here
[1670.90 → 1672.54] and that is coming
[1672.54 → 1673.72] and that Jesus
[1673.72 → 1674.58] deep desire
[1674.58 → 1675.52] as he invites us
[1675.52 → 1675.98] as apprentices
[1675.98 → 1676.94] as he sends us
[1676.94 → 1677.76] into our own cities
[1677.76 → 1678.46] and our own neighbourhoods
[1678.46 → 1679.52] is that through us
[1679.52 → 1680.42] and all of our
[1680.42 → 1681.12] ordinariness
[1681.12 → 1682.40] all the stuff
[1682.40 → 1682.88] we face
[1682.88 → 1683.74] all the brokenness
[1683.74 → 1684.16] of our past
[1684.16 → 1685.20] he will work
[1685.20 → 1685.94] through that
[1685.94 → 1687.10] by his power
[1687.10 → 1688.56] to make himself
[1688.56 → 1688.96] known
[1688.96 → 1691.24] and we have
[1691.24 → 1691.82] what it takes
[1691.82 → 1692.62] to grow
[1692.62 → 1694.12] to learn
[1694.12 → 1695.58] and to practice
[1695.58 → 1696.68] the life
[1696.68 → 1697.12] of the kingdom
[1697.12 → 1697.66] of God
[1697.66 → 1699.18] let's pray
[1699.18 → 1706.20] Father we thank you
[1706.20 → 1706.88] for your word
[1706.88 → 1709.42] we thank you
[1709.42 → 1710.12] that you build
[1710.12 → 1710.74] your church
[1710.74 → 1713.28] as we think
[1713.28 → 1713.88] on this passage
[1713.88 → 1714.48] where you call
[1714.48 → 1715.44] those first disciples
[1715.44 → 1716.00] to you
[1716.00 → 1717.66] the new Israel
[1717.66 → 1718.12] the church
[1718.12 → 1718.76] of which we are
[1718.76 → 1719.36] now a part
[1719.36 → 1720.02] we thank you
[1720.02 → 1720.90] that the gates
[1720.90 → 1721.34] of hell
[1721.34 → 1722.08] cannot prevail
[1722.08 → 1723.02] against your church
[1723.02 → 1724.40] that the kingdom
[1724.40 → 1725.02] is sealed
[1725.02 → 1725.72] by the death
[1725.72 → 1726.48] and the resurrection
[1726.48 → 1728.02] and that we
[1728.02 → 1729.32] right now
[1729.32 → 1730.32] have your authority
[1730.32 → 1732.62] we right now
[1732.62 → 1733.24] have the gift
[1733.24 → 1733.94] of your spirit
[1733.94 → 1736.06] Lord teach us
[1736.06 → 1736.62] your ways
[1736.62 → 1738.42] make us humble
[1738.42 → 1739.14] and eager
[1739.14 → 1739.82] learners
[1739.82 → 1741.52] we pray that you
[1741.52 → 1742.30] would spark
[1742.30 → 1743.34] our imaginations
[1743.34 → 1744.66] that you would
[1744.66 → 1745.98] unveil the gifts
[1745.98 → 1746.84] that we have
[1746.84 → 1748.04] that you would
[1748.04 → 1748.90] activate all the
[1748.90 → 1749.86] gifts in this body
[1749.86 → 1751.16] so that we would
[1751.16 → 1752.12] grow together
[1752.12 → 1753.06] as citizens
[1753.06 → 1753.58] of the kingdom
[1753.58 → 1754.10] of God
[1754.10 → 1756.46] thank you
[1756.46 → 1757.16] for the cross
[1757.16 → 1758.56] thank you
[1758.56 → 1759.48] that we are free
[1759.48 → 1760.86] and we pray
[1760.86 → 1761.56] that through us
[1761.56 → 1761.88] Lord
[1761.88 → 1762.66] many people
[1762.66 → 1763.24] in our city
[1763.24 → 1764.42] in our neighbourhoods
[1764.42 → 1765.70] would join
[1765.70 → 1766.88] in apprenticing
[1766.88 → 1767.84] to Jesus Christ
[1767.84 → 1768.78] and find life
[1768.78 → 1769.76] amen
[1769.76 → 1772.20] I invite you
[1772.20 → 1772.62] to stand
[1772.62 → 1773.28] in your homes
[1773.28 → 1773.98] and join me
[1773.98 → 1774.62] for our song
[1774.62 → 1775.24] of response
[1775.46 → 1776.50] What is
[1776.50 → 1777.60] this
[1777.60 → 1779.94] Amen
[1779.94 → 1802.38] NG
[1802.38 → 1804.38] amen
