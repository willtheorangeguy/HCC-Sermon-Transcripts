[0.00 → 4.46] It's always such a joy to gather together
[4.46 → 7.76] and to remind ourselves again
[7.76 → 10.88] that we are family in Christ together.
[12.54 → 14.58] As Nana mentioned in her prayer,
[14.72 → 18.28] we are concluding our series on servanthood.
[19.56 → 20.98] Eleven parts.
[21.82 → 22.98] Maybe some of you are saying,
[23.12 → 23.78] okay, enough already.
[24.58 → 25.26] I get it.
[25.74 → 27.00] Serve, and that's true.
[27.00 → 30.32] I hope that comes across quite strongly.
[31.32 → 32.64] Serve, and yet, you know,
[32.70 → 33.90] maybe there are parts of you that say,
[33.98 → 36.96] you know what, not everything in me wants to serve.
[37.72 → 39.42] Maybe I'm intimidated by service.
[40.16 → 43.14] But I want to talk about, yes, serve,
[43.98 → 47.28] but I want to get more at the heart of what it is to serve.
[47.96 → 51.16] And the heart of what it is to serve is to be like Christ,
[52.32 → 56.12] to make this, we are Christ-like in our leadership.
[56.12 → 57.94] We are Christ-like in our families,
[58.06 → 59.34] in our workplace, in our cities.
[60.46 → 65.10] We serve like Christ in the areas we find ourselves in.
[65.92 → 69.02] We serve Christ in our churches,
[69.18 → 70.58] in our communities, for the hurting.
[71.72 → 73.08] We started this series,
[73.64 → 76.18] when Pastor Dave first opened it up,
[76.30 → 78.96] with looking at Jesus in the washing of the feet.
[79.98 → 81.68] And I want to conclude it today with,
[82.26 → 83.90] this is all about Christ-likeness.
[83.90 → 85.46] And how do we get there?
[85.52 → 86.30] What does that look like?
[87.36 → 89.52] When we look at Mark 10, verse 45,
[89.76 → 91.50] in the New Testament, we read,
[92.24 → 93.36] in Scripture it says,
[93.46 → 96.84] For even the Son of Man did not come to be served,
[97.28 → 98.96] but to serve,
[99.24 → 101.20] to give His life as a ransom from any.
[102.60 → 103.96] And so this serving thing is about
[103.96 → 106.22] giving our lives away somehow.
[106.72 → 107.90] Paul writes in Ephesians 5,
[107.90 → 109.32] He writes,
[109.32 → 111.58] Follow God's example,
[112.00 → 113.86] therefore, as dearly loved children,
[114.34 → 116.58] and walk in the way of love,
[117.30 → 119.04] just as Christ loved us,
[119.08 → 120.58] and gave Himself up for us,
[120.60 → 121.60] as a fragrant offering,
[121.96 → 123.30] and sacrifice to God.
[123.60 → 126.26] And so somehow this giving ourselves away,
[126.64 → 127.56] is at the heart of this.
[127.76 → 129.48] A Christ-like heart.
[130.22 → 131.16] What does that look like?
[131.76 → 134.08] What does a servant heart actually look like?
[134.08 → 135.36] You know, we see people,
[135.52 → 136.34] we're going to church,
[136.48 → 138.52] we might tithe and give to good causes,
[138.78 → 139.50] we might help out,
[139.58 → 140.30] all good,
[140.58 → 142.88] but what's the heart behind it all?
[142.96 → 145.18] That's what I want to conclude with this morning.
[145.44 → 146.60] What's the heart behind it all?
[147.70 → 150.10] And I thought I'd use John 15,
[150.50 → 152.74] in the Gospel of John.
[152.86 → 156.26] John 15 has a good place where we look at that.
[156.56 → 157.82] And so let's read it together.
[157.96 → 159.30] John 15, 1-17,
[159.56 → 161.84] if you have your Bible with you,
[161.84 → 163.50] you can open up to it on your phone,
[163.58 → 164.58] or it'll be up here too.
[165.70 → 166.52] Let's read it together.
[167.00 → 168.92] I am the true vine.
[169.02 → 169.94] This is Jesus talking.
[170.74 → 172.28] My Father is the gardener.
[173.20 → 175.96] He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit,
[176.06 → 178.62] while every branch that does bear fruit,
[178.76 → 179.46] He prunes,
[179.86 → 181.98] so it will be more fruitful.
[183.10 → 184.62] You are already clean,
[184.62 → 187.18] because of the word I have spoken to you.
[188.54 → 189.46] Remain in me,
[189.70 → 191.40] as I also remain in you,
[191.92 → 194.98] no branch can bear fruit by itself.
[195.74 → 197.88] That I think is critically important.
[198.38 → 199.88] It must remain in the vine.
[200.34 → 203.50] Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.
[204.44 → 205.20] I am the vine,
[205.68 → 206.54] you are the branches.
[206.78 → 207.62] Let's keep it straight.
[208.40 → 210.02] If you remain in me and I in you,
[210.10 → 211.00] you will bear much fruit.
[211.14 → 211.78] Apart from me,
[211.84 → 212.46] you can do nothing.
[213.30 → 214.76] If you do not remain in me,
[214.84 → 215.68] you are like a branch
[215.68 → 217.28] that is thrown away and withers.
[217.40 → 218.50] Such branches are picked up
[218.50 → 219.76] and thrown into the fire and burned.
[219.76 → 221.08] If you remain in me
[221.08 → 223.22] and my words remain in you,
[224.18 → 225.42] ask whatever you wish
[225.42 → 227.14] and it will be done for you.
[227.66 → 230.24] This is to my Father's glory
[230.24 → 232.00] that you bear much fruit,
[232.38 → 234.50] showing yourselves to be my disciples.
[235.34 → 236.60] As the Father has loved me,
[236.66 → 237.32] so I have loved you.
[237.40 → 238.50] Now remain in my love.
[238.50 → 240.72] If you keep my command,
[240.86 → 241.76] you will remain in my love,
[241.82 → 243.60] just as I have kept my Father's commands
[243.60 → 244.90] and remain in His love.
[245.66 → 246.78] I have told you this
[246.78 → 248.62] so that my joy may be in you
[248.62 → 251.08] and that your joy may be complete.
[252.28 → 253.38] My command is this,
[253.48 → 254.90] love each other as I have loved you.
[255.42 → 257.62] Greater love has no one than this,
[257.76 → 259.78] to lay down one's life for one's friend.
[260.88 → 262.66] You are my friends if you do what I command.
[262.98 → 264.80] I no longer call you servants
[264.80 → 267.08] because a servant does not know his master's business.
[267.08 → 268.56] Instead, I call you friends
[268.56 → 270.66] for everything I have learned from my Father
[270.66 → 271.44] I have made known to you.
[271.94 → 273.54] You did not choose me.
[274.56 → 276.22] I chose you and appointed you
[276.22 → 280.30] that you might go and bear fruit,
[281.00 → 282.52] fruit that will last,
[283.10 → 284.92] and so that whatever you ask in my name
[284.92 → 285.72] the Father will give you.
[286.10 → 287.02] This is my command,
[287.24 → 288.62] love each other.
[290.66 → 291.72] When I read the passage,
[291.88 → 292.68] I've read it many times,
[292.80 → 293.92] but every time I read it,
[294.00 → 295.20] I reflect deeper on it.
[295.64 → 296.84] But what struck me this time
[296.84 → 298.56] was I noted that God
[298.56 → 300.82] has tied His glory
[300.82 → 302.54] to our fruitfulness.
[303.26 → 304.66] We read that in verse 8.
[304.96 → 306.64] This is to my Father's glory
[306.64 → 307.52] that you bear fruit.
[308.08 → 309.74] God ties His glory
[309.74 → 311.40] to our fruitfulness.
[311.84 → 313.58] When I use the word fruitfulness here,
[313.66 → 314.78] I'm also including
[314.78 → 316.28] these acts of service
[316.28 → 317.36] that we've been talking about.
[317.80 → 320.00] Servanthood is about fruitfulness.
[321.62 → 322.82] In this passage as well,
[322.82 → 325.32] Jesus tied our fruitfulness
[325.32 → 326.80] to His presence.
[326.80 → 328.22] Apart from me,
[328.34 → 329.30] you can do nothing.
[329.56 → 330.24] Sometimes I think,
[330.36 → 331.38] we just have to try harder.
[331.64 → 333.52] I'm not suggesting that you don't try hard,
[333.78 → 335.20] but that's not enough.
[336.14 → 337.44] You need to know
[337.44 → 339.34] that apart from Jesus,
[339.64 → 340.60] all your efforts
[340.60 → 341.72] aren't going to cut it.
[341.72 → 345.86] I think the world
[345.86 → 347.14] will see God clearer
[347.14 → 348.20] through our fruitfulness,
[348.36 → 350.10] through our acts of service.
[351.72 → 352.20] It's interesting,
[352.32 → 352.62] the Bible,
[352.76 → 354.58] when you looked at the idea
[354.58 → 355.94] of what it is to be fruitful,
[356.42 → 357.34] what does it mean,
[357.72 → 357.92] you know,
[358.00 → 359.12] it's become a kind of
[359.12 → 360.28] a churchy word in a way.
[360.36 → 361.54] I know Jesus didn't use it that way.
[361.86 → 363.00] But all through Scripture,
[363.34 → 364.56] way back even to Genesis,
[364.92 → 366.06] when we talk about fruitfulness,
[366.06 → 368.60] it means to reign or rule.
[368.60 → 371.60] To reign or rule.
[371.68 → 373.22] Look at Genesis 1.26,
[373.80 → 375.02] way back in the beginning here.
[375.08 → 376.18] Genesis 1.26.
[376.86 → 377.60] Then God said,
[377.72 → 379.10] let us make mankind in our image,
[379.18 → 379.82] in our likeness.
[379.94 → 381.74] Okay, we want to be Christ-like.
[382.78 → 384.60] So that they may rule
[385.16 → 386.78] over the fish of the sea
[386.78 → 387.56] and the birds of the air
[387.56 → 388.44] and the livestock
[388.44 → 389.66] and all the wild animals
[389.66 → 390.88] and over all the creatures
[390.88 → 391.58] that move along the ground,
[391.66 → 392.84] over all creation, in fact.
[394.20 → 396.08] We are to rule
[396.08 → 398.06] alongside God
[398.06 → 400.20] for the flourishing of creation.
[400.80 → 402.54] We are to expand Eden.
[403.90 → 404.80] The Garden of Eden, right?
[405.22 → 406.02] We talked about Jen.
[406.14 → 408.00] To take what God has given us,
[408.38 → 410.10] our time, our resources,
[410.22 → 411.18] our work, our talents,
[411.34 → 412.12] this whole planet,
[412.26 → 413.68] to take whatever it is
[413.68 → 414.66] and to use it
[414.66 → 416.24] to bring about flourishing
[416.24 → 418.10] because of our relationship
[418.10 → 418.98] to the Father
[418.98 → 420.94] in order to reflect His goodness
[420.94 → 422.22] and His grace.
[422.82 → 424.72] This is where the heart
[424.72 → 426.46] of service is.
[426.46 → 429.24] This is the heart
[429.24 → 430.32] of servanthood,
[430.98 → 434.02] to reign with the servant king
[434.02 → 436.42] alongside Him.
[436.80 → 438.84] You are designed by God
[438.84 → 439.80] for this.
[441.02 → 441.44] In Scripture,
[441.60 → 443.52] we often refer to this
[443.52 → 445.72] as stewardship, right?
[445.86 → 446.48] And a steward
[446.48 → 448.04] is a servant.
[448.18 → 448.58] It's servanthood.
[448.94 → 451.66] Working with the reign of God,
[451.66 → 454.86] the kingdom of God.
[457.80 → 458.90] I know you remember
[458.90 → 459.60] the old song,
[459.92 → 460.38] Bob Dylan,
[461.34 → 462.84] you've got to serve somebody.
[464.22 → 464.34] Right?
[464.50 → 465.06] And so,
[465.28 → 466.06] this idea that
[466.06 → 467.38] I'm not going to be a servant
[467.38 → 468.62] isn't going to work.
[468.94 → 470.72] You're serving something.
[472.18 → 472.64] You know,
[472.74 → 473.92] you're either going to serve
[473.92 → 474.64] the kingdom of God
[474.64 → 475.24] or you're going to serve
[475.24 → 476.00] the kingdom of the enemy.
[476.12 → 477.38] Those are the two options.
[477.80 → 478.52] Jesus says that
[478.52 → 479.32] in Matthew 6.
[479.36 → 480.00] Look at it with me.
[480.00 → 482.54] No one can serve
[482.54 → 483.30] two masters.
[483.82 → 485.16] Either you will hate the one
[485.16 → 485.94] and love the other
[485.94 → 488.04] or you will be devoted
[488.04 → 488.48] to the one
[488.48 → 489.20] and despise the other.
[489.32 → 490.70] You cannot serve
[490.70 → 491.72] both God and money,
[491.86 → 492.56] God and whatever
[492.56 → 493.44] you want to put in there.
[494.16 → 495.36] Your servanthood
[495.36 → 498.04] will show what kingdom
[498.04 → 499.02] you are advancing.
[500.40 → 501.88] And you will advance
[501.88 → 502.56] a kingdom.
[503.80 → 504.58] That's just how this
[504.58 → 505.20] is going to go.
[505.96 → 506.96] The fall happened.
[507.54 → 507.68] Right?
[507.74 → 508.40] We read about that
[508.40 → 509.30] in Genesis 2.
[509.30 → 511.54] Another way was presented
[511.54 → 512.64] other than God.
[513.00 → 514.24] You get to be God.
[515.02 → 516.14] That's at least the attempt
[516.14 → 517.12] that the evil one had
[517.12 → 517.80] in Genesis.
[518.38 → 520.00] And God through Scripture
[520.00 → 520.44] then is saying,
[520.52 → 520.82] you know what?
[520.88 → 521.82] I'm going to restore
[521.82 → 522.96] the original intention
[522.96 → 523.50] I had,
[523.56 → 525.04] the right and good reign
[525.04 → 525.60] of God
[525.60 → 526.74] in this world.
[527.10 → 528.32] Next week we start Advent.
[529.80 → 530.52] Can you believe that?
[530.56 → 531.38] We're already at Advent?
[532.62 → 532.96] I don't know.
[533.06 → 534.16] I'm a little stunned by that.
[534.24 → 534.52] But anyway,
[534.84 → 536.08] we talk about a light
[536.08 → 537.36] shining in the darkness.
[537.36 → 538.38] That's how John starts
[538.38 → 539.46] his gospel, right?
[540.22 → 540.70] This is,
[541.32 → 542.82] the kingdom has come.
[543.44 → 543.98] In Jesus,
[544.34 → 546.02] the kingdom is restored
[546.02 → 548.24] and it's an ongoing renewal
[548.24 → 549.26] of all things here.
[550.26 → 550.62] Jesus,
[551.00 → 552.22] when the very first Scripture
[552.22 → 553.10] he reads
[553.10 → 554.52] in public
[554.52 → 555.60] is out of Isaiah.
[555.72 → 556.20] We read this
[556.20 → 557.36] in Luke 4.18.
[557.48 → 558.10] He says this,
[558.10 → 559.72] The Spirit of the Lord
[559.72 → 560.62] is on me
[560.62 → 563.58] because He has anointed me
[563.58 → 564.92] to proclaim good news
[564.92 → 565.56] to the poor.
[566.20 → 566.82] He has sent me
[566.82 → 567.66] to proclaim freedom
[567.66 → 568.46] for the prisoner,
[568.82 → 569.42] recovery of sight
[569.42 → 570.02] to the blind,
[570.26 → 571.30] to set the oppressed free,
[571.56 → 572.28] to proclaim the year
[572.28 → 573.14] of the Lord's favour.
[575.46 → 575.94] Servanthood.
[576.96 → 577.44] Servanthood
[577.44 → 580.18] is about bringing vision back.
[580.50 → 580.90] Servanthood
[580.90 → 581.94] is about freeing
[581.94 → 582.78] those in bondage,
[582.86 → 583.60] those oppressed.
[584.04 → 584.48] Servanthood
[584.48 → 586.06] is about bringing healing
[586.06 → 586.60] somehow.
[586.60 → 590.64] I think we have
[590.64 → 592.20] sometimes a small view
[592.20 → 592.76] of servanthood
[592.76 → 593.92] that we're just going to do
[593.92 → 594.74] all kinds of good deeds.
[594.94 → 596.16] I think those good deeds
[596.16 → 596.96] reflect something
[596.96 → 597.70] much deeper.
[599.28 → 599.40] You know,
[599.44 → 600.72] when we invite people
[600.72 → 602.34] to serve the church,
[602.40 → 602.74] for example,
[602.82 → 603.76] by ushering
[603.76 → 605.30] and greeting at the door,
[605.64 → 605.74] you think,
[605.80 → 606.62] oh, what a small task.
[607.02 → 608.82] But it's a profound task.
[609.02 → 610.42] It's a task that says
[610.42 → 612.18] to people
[612.18 → 612.98] as they come in,
[613.22 → 614.66] we are welcoming you
[614.66 → 616.38] into the body of Christ
[616.38 → 617.20] a body
[617.20 → 618.04] that wants
[618.04 → 619.24] to make a difference
[619.24 → 619.80] in the world
[619.80 → 621.30] in the name of Christ.
[622.56 → 623.66] If you serve
[623.66 → 624.88] by making coffee,
[625.02 → 625.12] you say,
[625.18 → 626.18] oh, such a small task.
[626.48 → 627.38] We are saying
[627.38 → 629.14] hospitality matters.
[630.10 → 631.42] And when we get together
[631.42 → 632.48] over a cup of coffee,
[632.80 → 634.04] when we share life together,
[634.26 → 635.54] this is the point.
[635.54 → 640.84] It's what Jesus
[640.84 → 641.74] is saying in Isaiah.
[642.60 → 643.44] When you hang out
[643.44 → 643.96] with a friend
[643.96 → 644.66] who's going through
[644.66 → 645.40] a rough time,
[645.62 → 646.54] you're bringing about
[646.54 → 647.32] some healing,
[647.82 → 649.18] maybe bits and pieces,
[649.62 → 650.36] but this is what
[650.36 → 651.06] we're called to do.
[651.12 → 652.02] This is servanthood.
[652.28 → 653.16] When you serve
[653.16 → 653.88] in your families
[653.88 → 654.60] and you serve
[654.60 → 655.24] in your marriages
[655.24 → 655.94] and you serve
[655.94 → 657.38] wherever you are,
[657.60 → 658.84] it is about bringing
[658.84 → 659.54] the kingdom
[659.54 → 660.66] a little further
[660.66 → 661.58] and the renewal
[661.58 → 662.36] of all things.
[662.36 → 663.64] You are involved
[663.64 → 664.84] in kingdom building
[664.84 → 666.28] in everything you do.
[667.96 → 668.88] Which kingdom sometime?
[671.30 → 672.16] Which kingdom?
[676.66 → 678.52] Jesus says in Matthew 28,
[678.64 → 679.16] which we call
[679.16 → 680.04] the Great Commission,
[680.64 → 682.86] which is our vision statement,
[683.02 → 683.20] really.
[683.88 → 684.80] And Jesus said
[684.80 → 685.98] to his disciples,
[686.08 → 686.76] then he says to us,
[687.08 → 688.40] all authority in heaven
[688.40 → 688.78] and earth
[688.78 → 689.50] has been given to me.
[689.50 → 691.38] You hear the statement
[691.38 → 691.86] of rain?
[692.36 → 693.76] All authority
[693.76 → 694.76] has been given to me.
[695.20 → 696.46] All authority.
[697.98 → 699.06] Not bits and pieces.
[699.48 → 700.24] All authority
[700.24 → 701.02] has been given to me.
[701.58 → 702.02] Therefore,
[702.42 → 703.34] and out of that rain,
[703.74 → 704.32] therefore go
[704.32 → 704.98] make disciples
[704.98 → 705.38] of all nations,
[705.52 → 706.14] baptizing them
[706.14 → 706.70] in the name of the Father,
[707.02 → 707.54] teaching them
[707.54 → 708.16] to obey everything
[708.16 → 708.94] I've commanded you.
[710.02 → 710.80] And surely,
[711.40 → 712.40] I am with you
[712.40 → 713.02] in all that
[713.02 → 714.86] to the end of the age
[714.86 → 716.90] because apart from me,
[717.68 → 718.46] you can do nothing.
[718.46 → 718.56] Amen.
[722.36 → 723.30] And as the Father
[723.30 → 724.18] sent Jesus,
[725.12 → 726.50] Jesus sends us
[726.50 → 728.26] to go and expand
[728.26 → 728.72] the kingdom.
[729.54 → 729.98] It's a kingdom.
[731.48 → 732.48] Servanthood isn't just
[732.48 → 733.78] about doing good deeds.
[733.98 → 734.82] It's about expanding
[734.82 → 736.10] the kingdom come and coming.
[736.44 → 737.28] It's about living out
[737.28 → 737.88] that mission.
[738.44 → 739.56] He came to serve
[739.56 → 741.42] and so we are called
[741.42 → 742.06] to do the same.
[742.36 → 743.74] That's the mission strategy.
[744.16 → 745.42] He's the first disciple
[745.42 → 746.78] and we follow him.
[746.78 → 749.68] Now,
[750.60 → 751.96] back to John 15.
[753.06 → 754.02] I'm going to reread
[754.02 → 754.94] the first two verses.
[755.30 → 755.70] Jesus says,
[755.94 → 756.64] I am the vine
[756.64 → 758.24] and the Father is the gardener.
[758.92 → 760.10] He cuts off every branch
[760.10 → 762.38] in me that does not bear fruit
[762.38 → 763.42] while every branch
[763.42 → 764.12] that does bear fruit
[764.12 → 764.70] he prunes
[764.70 → 765.46] so that it will be
[765.46 → 766.22] even more fruitful.
[769.32 → 770.40] We're clear on that
[770.40 → 771.44] we're building the kingdom.
[772.10 → 773.30] We're clear on how
[773.30 → 774.46] Christ wants to build
[774.46 → 775.30] servant hearts
[775.30 → 776.54] like his
[776.54 → 778.10] so we can do that work.
[779.18 → 780.52] Here's a big piece
[780.52 → 781.34] of the process.
[781.72 → 782.48] You want to develop
[782.48 → 783.38] a servant heart,
[783.92 → 785.28] a more Christ-like heart
[785.28 → 787.18] and this verse says,
[787.66 → 791.26] you have to get cut.
[796.12 → 797.00] You want to serve
[797.00 → 797.56] and bear fruit?
[798.74 → 799.86] You have to get cut.
[802.16 → 803.44] Some things have to go.
[803.44 → 806.30] Some things have to die.
[807.70 → 808.20] You want me?
[808.56 → 808.84] Yeah,
[809.00 → 809.50] and you.
[810.66 → 812.06] Some things have to die.
[814.40 → 816.16] I won't serve
[816.16 → 817.44] when I have two masters,
[817.50 → 818.22] at least not well.
[818.42 → 819.60] I won't serve others
[819.60 → 820.92] when I love myself
[820.92 → 822.12] or I protect myself
[822.12 → 823.96] more than anything else.
[824.16 → 825.46] I won't serve
[825.46 → 826.38] like Christ then.
[828.82 → 829.56] Philippians 2.
[829.98 → 830.44] Paul describes
[830.44 → 832.16] describes how Jesus
[832.16 → 832.78] served here.
[833.24 → 833.56] Rather,
[833.70 → 833.94] Jesus,
[834.22 → 835.42] he made himself
[835.42 → 835.84] what?
[835.96 → 836.06] What?
[836.50 → 836.94] Everything?
[837.40 → 837.80] Nothing.
[839.42 → 840.54] He made himself
[840.54 → 840.96] nothing
[840.96 → 841.98] by taking the very
[841.98 → 842.70] nature of a servant,
[842.98 → 844.14] being made in human likeness
[844.14 → 844.90] and being found
[844.90 → 845.46] in appearance
[845.46 → 846.16] as a man.
[846.24 → 846.94] He humbled himself
[846.94 → 847.70] to become obedient
[847.70 → 848.32] to death,
[848.48 → 849.38] even death on the cross.
[849.90 → 850.38] Therefore,
[851.00 → 853.10] God exalted him
[853.10 → 854.72] above the highest place
[854.72 → 855.96] and gave him the name
[855.96 → 856.74] that is above
[856.74 → 857.84] every name.
[857.84 → 863.78] This becoming nothing
[863.78 → 866.48] leads to exaltation.
[874.56 → 876.22] Out of our obedience,
[877.02 → 877.94] out of our willingness
[877.94 → 879.50] to have things die
[879.50 → 880.18] in ourselves,
[880.90 → 882.62] comes exaltation
[882.62 → 884.12] because we reign
[884.12 → 885.82] with the King of Kings.
[885.82 → 888.04] that's what's
[888.04 → 888.74] going on here.
[889.84 → 890.54] This isn't
[890.54 → 891.96] about grovelling.
[892.02 → 892.42] I think we have
[892.42 → 893.06] this weird idea
[893.06 → 893.46] of servant
[893.46 → 893.64] that,
[893.72 → 893.78] oh,
[893.78 → 894.58] I'm the servant.
[895.08 → 896.36] This isn't about that.
[896.46 → 897.22] Not at all.
[897.52 → 898.28] This is about
[898.28 → 899.24] the Father's glory
[899.24 → 899.84] in His kingdom
[899.84 → 901.30] and we align ourselves
[901.30 → 902.02] to His will
[902.02 → 903.16] and then ironically,
[903.62 → 904.60] we are exalted
[904.60 → 905.88] with Christ.
[905.88 → 909.84] but we have some
[909.84 → 910.96] cutting to experience.
[912.14 → 913.04] Things that work
[913.04 → 913.98] against the kingdom
[913.98 → 914.94] have to go
[914.94 → 916.82] and this cutting
[916.82 → 918.08] and this pruning
[918.08 → 919.98] produces more fruit
[919.98 → 921.44] which is then lived out
[921.44 → 922.58] in more acts of service
[922.58 → 923.58] to a world
[923.58 → 924.62] that God so loves.
[925.18 → 925.98] All growth
[925.98 → 927.32] requires ongoing pruning.
[927.94 → 928.48] Aren't you excited?
[930.16 → 930.86] Aren't you excited
[930.86 → 931.98] you get to get pruned?
[933.56 → 934.88] Things get to go.
[934.88 → 935.76] You know what?
[936.44 → 937.48] With grapes.
[937.62 → 938.40] Think of grapes.
[939.16 → 940.46] If they're not pruned,
[940.92 → 942.44] you will not produce
[942.44 → 943.90] more grapes.
[944.34 → 944.90] They will use
[944.90 → 945.88] all their energy
[945.88 → 947.84] to extend themselves
[947.84 → 948.58] further
[948.58 → 951.06] producing more branches
[951.06 → 952.90] not more fruit.
[954.30 → 955.04] It's the same with us.
[955.12 → 956.14] If we aren't pruned
[956.14 → 956.66] by the Father,
[956.80 → 957.52] we'll be busy
[957.52 → 958.24] expanding our
[958.24 → 959.26] pathetic little kingdoms
[959.26 → 960.20] and we'll fail
[960.20 → 960.92] to take part
[960.92 → 962.10] in the eternal kingdom
[962.10 → 962.62] of God
[962.62 → 963.72] and His good reign.
[964.88 → 966.46] and we will not grow
[966.46 → 968.66] and therefore
[968.66 → 969.90] we will not serve easily
[969.90 → 970.78] if at all.
[972.58 → 973.90] As you grow,
[974.24 → 975.08] the heart of servitude,
[975.36 → 976.08] as you grow
[976.08 → 976.66] you develop
[976.66 → 977.94] a more Christ-like heart
[977.94 → 978.80] and then when you
[978.80 → 980.00] will naturally serve
[980.00 → 980.60] out of that
[980.60 → 981.84] Christ-like love
[981.84 → 985.06] and then serving
[985.06 → 987.08] won't just be an add-on.
[987.66 → 988.56] Serving will be
[988.56 → 989.92] a way you live.
[990.70 → 992.14] You won't even be thinking
[992.14 → 993.44] I'm serving.
[994.72 → 996.14] You will just be loving
[996.14 → 997.64] like Christ loves.
[997.64 → 1003.94] I recently heard a pastor say
[1003.94 → 1005.16] you can only live
[1005.16 → 1006.00] where you die.
[1008.16 → 1009.16] You can only live
[1009.16 → 1009.92] where you die.
[1010.74 → 1012.36] And I think that's true.
[1012.50 → 1013.62] I realize there's a lot
[1013.62 → 1014.56] of places where I still
[1014.56 → 1015.16] need to die
[1015.16 → 1016.04] so I can live more
[1016.04 → 1016.64] like Christ
[1016.64 → 1017.90] and have His heart.
[1018.10 → 1019.24] So I can get out of the way
[1019.24 → 1019.92] and allow the gardener
[1019.92 → 1021.22] to prune me
[1021.22 → 1022.52] so I can be more fruitful,
[1022.70 → 1023.40] more servant-hearted.
[1023.40 → 1026.04] Let me ask you,
[1026.50 → 1027.36] any of you ever
[1027.36 → 1028.38] dishonest with yourself?
[1029.32 → 1029.80] Not just me
[1029.80 → 1031.00] or maybe you do too?
[1032.10 → 1033.26] I'm guessing yes
[1033.26 → 1034.00] for everybody.
[1038.10 → 1040.32] When lies get exposed
[1040.32 → 1043.08] and we all live
[1043.08 → 1043.86] with some lies.
[1044.94 → 1045.90] We grew up with them.
[1046.02 → 1046.72] We learned them.
[1047.98 → 1049.24] Our culture teaches them
[1049.24 → 1049.74] to us.
[1050.42 → 1051.82] When these lies get exposed
[1051.82 → 1053.40] there's the fear
[1053.40 → 1054.22] behind those lies.
[1055.58 → 1056.22] And you know,
[1056.26 → 1057.64] maybe I fear to serve others
[1057.64 → 1058.66] because I feel inadequate
[1058.66 → 1059.30] or unwilling
[1059.30 → 1061.60] or maybe I'm a lot more selfish
[1061.60 → 1062.44] than I thought I was.
[1062.70 → 1063.64] And there are areas
[1063.64 → 1065.82] where I don't trust God
[1065.82 → 1066.98] as much as I should.
[1067.22 → 1068.72] So I think I have to
[1068.72 → 1069.88] pull everything
[1069.88 → 1071.28] and carry everything
[1071.28 → 1073.36] because I trust me
[1073.36 → 1075.02] more than I trust God.
[1075.22 → 1076.26] And so I'm not going to
[1076.26 → 1077.06] surrender all that stuff
[1077.06 → 1078.36] because I don't trust God
[1078.36 → 1079.10] that much.
[1079.10 → 1080.84] and that keeps me
[1080.84 → 1081.70] from stepping out
[1081.70 → 1082.22] in obedience.
[1084.92 → 1086.68] And I need to start imagining
[1086.68 → 1088.62] what might God do
[1088.62 → 1089.18] in me
[1089.18 → 1090.04] and in my life
[1090.04 → 1090.72] and through me
[1090.72 → 1092.04] if I could die
[1092.04 → 1093.16] here.
[1094.28 → 1095.44] If I could die
[1095.44 → 1096.20] in this area
[1096.20 → 1097.48] or this area.
[1098.60 → 1100.14] If that would be cut out
[1100.14 → 1101.40] what might happen?
[1102.10 → 1103.18] What might God do?
[1103.38 → 1104.58] Because I can only live
[1104.58 → 1105.50] where I'm dying
[1105.50 → 1106.68] to self-centredness.
[1106.68 → 1108.08] And so God
[1108.08 → 1109.34] I need you
[1109.34 → 1111.04] to cut here
[1111.04 → 1112.44] or to cut here
[1112.44 → 1113.36] or to cut here.
[1113.48 → 1114.42] I don't want that
[1114.42 → 1115.30] because I'm hanging on
[1115.30 → 1115.96] to that in some kind
[1115.96 → 1116.56] of false way
[1116.56 → 1117.68] but I need you
[1117.68 → 1118.78] to cut that
[1118.78 → 1119.92] out of my life.
[1124.66 → 1125.64] So that I can
[1125.64 → 1127.10] participate
[1127.10 → 1127.86] in the flourishing
[1127.86 → 1128.84] of your kingdom come
[1128.84 → 1129.84] so that I can be
[1129.84 → 1130.24] the blessing
[1130.24 → 1131.30] that you want me to be.
[1132.22 → 1132.90] And this is how
[1132.90 → 1133.84] God answers our prayers.
[1133.84 → 1137.46] be careful
[1137.46 → 1137.98] what you pray.
[1141.16 → 1141.44] You know
[1141.44 → 1142.36] when we read
[1142.36 → 1143.50] in John 15
[1143.50 → 1145.46] verse 7 and 8
[1145.46 → 1145.64] it says
[1145.64 → 1146.68] if you remain in me
[1146.68 → 1147.94] and my words
[1147.94 → 1148.56] remain in you
[1148.56 → 1149.88] ask whatever you wish
[1149.88 → 1150.36] and it will be done
[1150.36 → 1150.56] for you.
[1150.64 → 1151.68] This is to my Father's glory
[1151.68 → 1152.58] that you bear much fruit.
[1153.16 → 1153.24] Right?
[1153.62 → 1154.56] Ask whatever
[1154.56 → 1156.18] you want.
[1156.88 → 1157.38] Maybe some of you
[1157.38 → 1157.54] are saying
[1157.54 → 1157.80] really?
[1157.80 → 1157.88] Really?
[1159.12 → 1159.72] Really ask
[1159.72 → 1160.40] whatever I want
[1160.40 → 1161.18] and I'm going to get it?
[1161.18 → 1165.58] And yet it says
[1165.58 → 1166.52] his glory
[1166.52 → 1168.04] is tied
[1168.04 → 1169.40] to your fruitfulness
[1169.40 → 1170.24] to your servanthood.
[1170.50 → 1172.02] We have this weird notion
[1172.02 → 1173.24] that if we
[1173.24 → 1174.58] we look worse
[1174.58 → 1175.60] somehow
[1175.60 → 1176.92] God looks better
[1176.92 → 1178.92] in some ways.
[1179.80 → 1179.94] Right?
[1179.98 → 1180.88] So servanthood is
[1180.88 → 1181.52] you know
[1181.52 → 1182.56] less of me
[1182.56 → 1183.54] more of you
[1183.54 → 1184.68] and that's true
[1184.68 → 1185.68] but it's not
[1185.68 → 1186.34] less of me
[1186.34 → 1186.80] because I'm
[1186.80 → 1188.24] useless
[1188.24 → 1189.30] and God doesn't
[1189.30 → 1189.78] care about me
[1189.78 → 1190.16] very much.
[1190.52 → 1191.10] Less of me
[1191.10 → 1191.38] more
[1191.38 → 1191.70] you know
[1191.70 → 1193.32] not that at all.
[1194.02 → 1194.16] You know
[1194.16 → 1195.02] I think I've said it before
[1195.02 → 1195.26] right?
[1195.38 → 1196.08] Winston Churchill said
[1196.08 → 1197.50] I may be a worm
[1197.50 → 1198.34] but I'm a glow-worm.
[1200.66 → 1200.86] You know
[1200.86 → 1204.00] God is glorified
[1204.00 → 1205.18] hear me well
[1205.18 → 1206.90] God is glorified
[1206.90 → 1208.00] by you
[1208.00 → 1208.98] being
[1208.98 → 1210.00] amazing.
[1212.28 → 1213.82] God is glorified
[1213.82 → 1215.04] honest
[1215.04 → 1216.86] but God is glorified
[1216.86 → 1217.86] by you being amazing.
[1217.86 → 1220.04] by living out
[1220.04 → 1221.60] your giftedness
[1221.60 → 1222.34] because you were gifted.
[1223.32 → 1223.54] Yeah
[1223.54 → 1224.24] by being honest
[1224.24 → 1224.80] about the weaknesses
[1224.80 → 1225.62] where you need to be cut
[1225.62 → 1226.96] but by living out
[1226.96 → 1228.08] your talents
[1228.08 → 1229.36] by being
[1229.36 → 1230.30] just like
[1230.30 → 1230.98] his son
[1230.98 → 1232.04] the servant king
[1232.04 → 1233.82] it's God's desire
[1233.82 → 1235.10] that you are fruitful
[1235.10 → 1236.68] that you are productive
[1236.68 → 1237.50] for his good kingdom.
[1237.92 → 1238.38] So yes
[1238.38 → 1239.84] pray boldly
[1239.84 → 1241.08] pray in the context
[1241.08 → 1242.18] of the father's glory.
[1243.14 → 1243.24] Now
[1243.24 → 1244.14] something I'm saying
[1244.14 → 1244.74] and I've said it too
[1244.74 → 1245.72] I prayed a lot of things
[1245.72 → 1246.40] and they didn't happen
[1246.40 → 1247.12] the way I prayed
[1247.12 → 1247.50] you know
[1247.50 → 1249.54] what's going on there?
[1250.92 → 1252.48] We started this passage
[1252.48 → 1254.12] John starts this passage
[1254.12 → 1254.46] with
[1254.46 → 1257.00] remain in me
[1257.00 → 1258.28] in Jesus
[1258.28 → 1259.56] and then he says
[1259.56 → 1260.06] apart from me
[1260.06 → 1260.64] you can do nothing.
[1261.08 → 1262.78] Remain in his presence
[1262.78 → 1265.92] because we don't always
[1265.92 → 1267.26] I know we're always
[1267.26 → 1268.08] in his presence
[1268.08 → 1269.22] but we don't always
[1269.22 → 1270.44] live like we're
[1270.44 → 1271.50] in his presence.
[1271.50 → 1276.08] In fact I think
[1276.08 → 1277.42] in many ways
[1277.42 → 1278.04] sometimes we live
[1278.04 → 1279.26] like we're practical atheists.
[1282.24 → 1282.96] I remember
[1282.96 → 1285.40] when I was a middle school teacher
[1285.40 → 1286.92] and
[1286.92 → 1288.94] you know
[1288.94 → 1289.56] we were reading
[1289.56 → 1291.76] about God's presence
[1291.76 → 1292.64] in the Old Testament
[1292.64 → 1293.88] and how God showed up
[1293.88 → 1295.68] in a pillar of fire
[1295.68 → 1296.08] and
[1296.08 → 1297.06] you know
[1297.06 → 1298.34] or at Mount Sinai
[1298.34 → 1299.44] and the mountain rumbled
[1299.44 → 1300.48] thunder and lightning
[1300.48 → 1301.86] and you say
[1301.86 → 1302.72] how many of you would
[1302.72 → 1303.48] you know
[1303.48 → 1304.38] tremble before God
[1304.38 → 1304.92] at that moment?
[1305.22 → 1305.92] Oh yeah yeah yeah.
[1306.72 → 1307.42] And I was
[1307.42 → 1308.78] teaching a class
[1308.78 → 1309.12] and I said
[1309.12 → 1310.10] I had a phone call
[1310.10 → 1310.90] so I had to step out
[1310.90 → 1312.36] and we had just
[1312.36 → 1313.02] finished talking
[1313.02 → 1314.78] do you believe
[1314.78 → 1315.38] that God
[1315.38 → 1315.96] who came in the
[1315.96 → 1316.46] pillar of fire
[1316.46 → 1317.54] and shook Mount Sinai
[1317.54 → 1318.36] do you believe
[1318.36 → 1319.62] he's here right now?
[1320.62 → 1320.94] And all this
[1320.94 → 1321.56] said oh yeah
[1321.56 → 1322.12] oh yeah.
[1322.12 → 1324.90] and I came back
[1324.90 → 1325.06] and
[1325.06 → 1326.76] it was pandemonium
[1326.76 → 1327.44] in the classroom
[1327.44 → 1330.14] and
[1330.14 → 1332.22] we talked about
[1332.22 → 1332.98] do we actually
[1332.98 → 1333.88] believe God is here?
[1334.96 → 1335.60] Because if God
[1335.60 → 1336.78] was actually here
[1336.78 → 1337.80] in a pillar of fire
[1337.80 → 1339.06] would everybody
[1339.06 → 1339.72] have messed around
[1339.72 → 1340.30] in class?
[1344.54 → 1345.28] And I look
[1345.28 → 1345.86] at my own life
[1345.86 → 1347.56] I live like God
[1347.56 → 1348.34] not even in the room
[1348.34 → 1348.80] sometimes.
[1348.80 → 1348.88] Yeah.
[1352.12 → 1353.30] Do you believe
[1353.30 → 1354.16] God is present?
[1358.26 → 1359.16] When you're acting
[1359.16 → 1359.76] like a jerk?
[1362.72 → 1363.58] Do you believe
[1363.58 → 1364.46] God is present?
[1366.86 → 1367.86] Every time you're
[1367.86 → 1368.40] looking at the
[1368.40 → 1369.14] computer screen?
[1370.78 → 1371.74] Do you believe
[1371.74 → 1372.74] God is present
[1372.74 → 1375.00] when you're engaging
[1375.00 → 1375.92] somebody in not
[1375.92 → 1377.08] very healthy ways?
[1380.30 → 1381.14] Do you believe
[1381.14 → 1381.96] God is present
[1381.96 → 1383.30] with the way
[1383.30 → 1383.74] you spend
[1383.74 → 1384.16] your money?
[1390.50 → 1391.28] Apart from me
[1391.28 → 1392.04] you can do nothing.
[1393.00 → 1393.76] Remain in his
[1393.76 → 1394.20] presence.
[1394.40 → 1395.06] Practice his
[1395.06 → 1395.42] presence.
[1396.18 → 1396.34] You know
[1396.34 → 1397.32] and when you do
[1397.32 → 1398.18] that then you say
[1398.18 → 1399.18] God
[1399.18 → 1400.42] what's your will
[1400.42 → 1401.26] in this particular
[1401.26 → 1401.64] moment?
[1401.82 → 1402.26] Because Jesus
[1402.26 → 1403.16] just then said
[1403.16 → 1404.40] let my words
[1404.40 → 1405.24] remain in you
[1405.24 → 1406.38] because his words
[1406.38 → 1407.30] bring life.
[1407.30 → 1412.04] in verse 3
[1412.04 → 1412.40] you know
[1412.40 → 1413.40] of John 15
[1413.40 → 1413.90] let me read it
[1413.90 → 1414.26] to you again
[1414.26 → 1414.48] it said
[1414.48 → 1415.10] you are already
[1415.10 → 1415.76] clean because
[1415.76 → 1416.26] of the word
[1416.26 → 1416.92] I have spoken
[1416.92 → 1417.26] to you.
[1417.54 → 1418.04] You are already
[1418.04 → 1418.68] clean because
[1418.68 → 1419.26] of what Christ
[1419.26 → 1419.60] has done
[1419.60 → 1420.08] and what Christ
[1420.08 → 1420.52] has said.
[1420.74 → 1421.18] His words
[1421.18 → 1421.86] have power.
[1422.64 → 1422.82] You know
[1422.82 → 1423.56] you're clean
[1423.56 → 1424.42] you're pruned
[1424.42 → 1424.92] because his
[1424.92 → 1425.24] words
[1425.24 → 1426.12] so submit
[1426.12 → 1426.72] to those
[1426.72 → 1427.14] words
[1427.14 → 1427.74] and then
[1427.74 → 1428.76] you can
[1428.76 → 1429.50] bear fruit
[1429.50 → 1430.44] and then
[1430.44 → 1431.18] out of that
[1431.18 → 1431.96] you pray.
[1431.96 → 1435.84] you pray
[1435.84 → 1436.82] with awareness
[1436.82 → 1437.46] of his presence
[1437.46 → 1438.10] you pray
[1438.10 → 1438.72] living off
[1438.72 → 1439.28] his words
[1439.28 → 1440.06] then you get
[1440.06 → 1440.46] answers
[1440.46 → 1441.08] then those
[1441.08 → 1441.38] prayers
[1441.38 → 1441.80] come out
[1441.80 → 1442.40] of service
[1442.40 → 1443.62] then suddenly
[1443.62 → 1444.20] your prayers
[1444.20 → 1444.88] are not
[1444.88 → 1446.30] just your
[1446.30 → 1446.70] prayers
[1446.70 → 1447.56] they're in
[1447.56 → 1448.10] the context
[1448.10 → 1448.58] of the kingdom
[1448.58 → 1449.24] come and coming
[1449.24 → 1450.24] prayers
[1450.24 → 1450.84] from our
[1450.84 → 1451.30] relationship
[1451.30 → 1451.62] with the
[1451.62 → 1451.88] father
[1451.88 → 1452.76] not when
[1452.76 → 1453.22] you're out
[1453.22 → 1454.00] of relationship
[1454.00 → 1454.68] then you
[1454.68 → 1455.04] better be
[1455.04 → 1455.24] praying
[1455.24 → 1455.50] Lord
[1455.50 → 1456.00] bring me
[1456.00 → 1456.32] back
[1456.32 → 1457.10] into relationship
[1457.10 → 1457.68] and prune
[1457.68 → 1458.12] some stuff
[1458.12 → 1458.52] that needs
[1458.52 → 1458.96] pruning
[1458.96 → 1462.16] I pray
[1462.16 → 1462.54] this with
[1462.54 → 1463.06] the desire
[1463.06 → 1463.88] to above
[1463.88 → 1464.48] all remain
[1464.48 → 1464.82] in you
[1464.82 → 1465.36] and I
[1465.36 → 1465.98] trust that
[1465.98 → 1466.34] you will
[1466.34 → 1467.02] bring fruit
[1467.02 → 1467.84] in my
[1467.84 → 1468.38] life
[1468.38 → 1470.68] servanthood
[1470.68 → 1471.64] is about
[1471.64 → 1472.18] submission
[1472.18 → 1472.90] and we
[1472.90 → 1473.42] surrender
[1473.42 → 1474.02] our lives
[1474.02 → 1474.44] and we
[1474.44 → 1474.82] surrender
[1474.82 → 1475.32] our wills
[1475.32 → 1475.60] to a
[1475.60 → 1476.02] better will
[1476.02 → 1476.52] his will
[1476.52 → 1477.28] and then
[1477.28 → 1477.86] we trust
[1477.86 → 1478.20] that the
[1478.20 → 1478.54] pruning
[1478.54 → 1478.90] and the
[1478.90 → 1479.20] pain
[1479.20 → 1479.84] will lead
[1479.84 → 1480.44] to growth
[1480.44 → 1480.90] and to
[1480.90 → 1481.24] blessing
[1481.24 → 1481.78] and then
[1481.78 → 1482.32] that pruning
[1482.32 → 1483.02] will expose
[1483.02 → 1483.50] the life
[1483.50 → 1484.16] that keep
[1484.16 → 1484.44] us from
[1484.44 → 1484.88] serving
[1484.88 → 1485.46] and surrendering
[1485.46 → 1485.74] to the
[1485.74 → 1486.02] good will
[1486.02 → 1486.24] of the
[1486.24 → 1486.58] father
[1486.58 → 1492.44] anything
[1492.44 → 1493.24] that makes
[1493.24 → 1493.98] you feel
[1493.98 → 1494.60] hopeless
[1494.60 → 1496.30] maybe you have
[1496.30 → 1496.60] some areas
[1496.60 → 1496.96] in your life
[1496.96 → 1497.54] sometimes you feel
[1497.54 → 1497.78] hopeless
[1497.78 → 1498.58] anything that
[1498.58 → 1499.04] makes you feel
[1499.04 → 1499.50] hopeless is
[1499.50 → 1499.94] built on a
[1499.94 → 1500.24] lie that
[1500.24 → 1500.58] needs to be
[1500.58 → 1500.94] exposed
[1500.94 → 1501.84] and replaced
[1501.84 → 1502.20] by the
[1502.20 → 1502.80] truth that
[1502.80 → 1503.22] the father
[1503.22 → 1503.98] wants growth
[1503.98 → 1504.38] for that
[1504.38 → 1505.10] area so
[1505.10 → 1505.48] you can
[1505.48 → 1505.84] serve and
[1505.84 → 1506.22] bless those
[1506.22 → 1506.76] around you
[1506.76 → 1510.46] what you
[1510.46 → 1511.24] dwell on
[1511.24 → 1511.78] and stew
[1511.78 → 1512.20] on and
[1512.20 → 1512.94] obsess about
[1512.94 → 1513.86] are areas
[1513.86 → 1514.44] that often
[1514.44 → 1515.10] haven't been
[1515.10 → 1515.82] surrendered to
[1515.82 → 1516.22] the father
[1516.22 → 1519.32] there are
[1519.32 → 1520.00] simply areas
[1520.00 → 1520.50] that begin
[1520.50 → 1520.84] and end
[1520.84 → 1521.30] with you
[1521.30 → 1523.12] there are
[1523.12 → 1523.64] areas that
[1523.64 → 1524.14] need to be
[1524.14 → 1524.48] pruned
[1524.48 → 1525.48] which can
[1525.48 → 1525.86] be a lot
[1525.86 → 1526.16] of hard
[1526.16 → 1526.54] work and
[1526.54 → 1526.78] a lot
[1526.78 → 1528.06] of constant
[1528.06 → 1528.52] surrender
[1528.52 → 1529.28] time and
[1529.28 → 1530.38] time again
[1530.38 → 1533.84] let me ask
[1533.84 → 1534.12] you this
[1534.12 → 1535.96] what's the
[1535.96 → 1536.34] job of the
[1536.34 → 1536.68] branch
[1536.68 → 1539.56] because in
[1539.56 → 1540.30] this passage
[1540.30 → 1541.30] it's what we
[1541.30 → 1541.58] are
[1541.58 → 1543.28] you're a
[1543.28 → 1543.54] branch
[1543.54 → 1543.80] I'm a
[1543.80 → 1544.16] branch
[1544.16 → 1546.80] what's the
[1546.80 → 1547.18] job of the
[1547.18 → 1547.48] branch
[1547.48 → 1548.46] the branch
[1548.46 → 1548.94] has one
[1548.94 → 1549.38] job
[1549.38 → 1551.24] receive the
[1551.24 → 1551.90] nutrients that
[1551.90 → 1552.52] the roots pull
[1552.52 → 1553.08] up for them
[1553.08 → 1553.74] so they can
[1553.74 → 1554.10] bear fruit
[1554.10 → 1556.52] that's the
[1556.52 → 1556.84] job of the
[1556.84 → 1557.16] branch
[1557.16 → 1559.42] you know
[1559.42 → 1560.88] you should do
[1560.88 → 1562.24] a word study
[1562.24 → 1562.94] about the
[1562.94 → 1563.30] number of
[1563.30 → 1563.84] times the
[1563.84 → 1564.46] word receive

[1565.04 → 1565.30] the new
[1565.30 → 1565.72] testament
[1565.72 → 1567.90] receive
[1567.90 → 1569.96] I think
[1569.96 → 1570.56] many of us
[1570.56 → 1571.54] need to learn
[1571.54 → 1572.18] what it is
[1572.18 → 1573.54] to receive
[1573.54 → 1574.42] the branch
[1574.42 → 1574.92] simply
[1574.92 → 1575.76] receives
[1575.76 → 1576.56] nutrients
[1576.56 → 1578.78] we need
[1578.78 → 1579.62] to simply
[1579.62 → 1580.70] learn to
[1580.70 → 1581.20] receive
[1581.20 → 1582.16] we're forever
[1582.16 → 1582.94] trying to
[1582.94 → 1583.76] muscle fruit
[1583.76 → 1584.60] out of our
[1584.60 → 1585.34] own strength
[1585.34 → 1586.36] not always the
[1586.36 → 1587.02] best fruit by
[1587.02 → 1587.66] any stretch of
[1587.66 → 1588.24] the imagination
[1588.24 → 1589.58] his presence
[1589.58 → 1590.76] his words
[1590.76 → 1591.42] they are the
[1591.42 → 1591.92] nutrients
[1591.92 → 1593.22] we receive
[1593.22 → 1594.12] the work of
[1594.12 → 1594.74] the gardener
[1594.74 → 1596.26] we submit to
[1596.26 → 1596.88] his work
[1596.88 → 1597.34] to his
[1597.34 → 1597.60] presence
[1597.60 → 1598.94] God wants us
[1598.94 → 1599.46] to be fruitful
[1599.46 → 1600.10] he wants to be
[1600.10 → 1601.50] fruitful more
[1601.50 → 1602.04] than we often
[1602.04 → 1602.34] want to be
[1602.34 → 1602.66] fruitful
[1602.66 → 1604.66] it's to his
[1604.66 → 1605.28] glory that you
[1605.28 → 1605.62] bear much
[1605.62 → 1605.96] fruit
[1605.96 → 1607.24] that's the
[1607.24 → 1607.56] process
[1607.56 → 1608.06] developing
[1608.06 → 1608.94] fruitful lives
[1608.94 → 1609.54] and living out
[1609.54 → 1611.20] our call to
[1611.20 → 1611.58] serve as

[1612.30 → 1613.74] he has
[1613.74 → 1614.66] designed you
[1614.66 → 1615.44] to be fruitful
[1615.44 → 1616.52] so that the
[1616.52 → 1617.00] world may
[1617.00 → 1617.80] clearly see
[1617.80 → 1618.58] who God
[1618.58 → 1618.90] is
[1618.90 → 1620.04] and that he
[1620.04 → 1620.82] is a
[1620.82 → 1621.38] loving God
[1621.38 → 1622.76] our job
[1622.76 → 1624.16] keep dying
[1624.16 → 1624.64] to self
[1624.64 → 1625.98] keep submitting

[1626.60 → 1628.18] keep turning
[1628.18 → 1628.72] toward him
[1628.72 → 1629.36] in obedience
[1629.36 → 1631.10] and then
[1631.10 → 1632.62] cooperate
[1632.62 → 1633.06] with his
[1633.06 → 1633.38] reign
[1633.38 → 1635.04] it's
[1635.04 → 1635.70] God's
[1635.70 → 1636.18] job to
[1636.18 → 1636.58] prune
[1636.58 → 1636.94] and to
[1636.94 → 1637.48] grow you
[1637.48 → 1638.10] and to
[1638.10 → 1638.50] resurrect
[1638.50 → 1638.86] out of
[1638.86 → 1639.30] that which
[1639.30 → 1639.84] dies
[1639.84 → 1640.90] to grow

[1648.08 → 1648.22] going to
[1648.22 → 1648.56] end it
[1648.56 → 1649.00] with this
[1649.00 → 1650.02] if we
[1650.02 → 1650.30] look at
[1650.30 → 1651.08] John 15
[1651.08 → 1652.90] the verse
[1652.90 → 1653.46] 12
[1653.46 → 1655.10] to the end

[1659.72 → 1660.04] love
[1660.04 → 1660.38] is no
[1660.38 → 1660.64] one
[1660.64 → 1661.66] than this
[1661.66 → 1662.14] to lay
[1662.14 → 1662.38] down
[1662.38 → 1662.76] one's
[1662.76 → 1663.04] life

[1667.72 → 1668.20] call you
[1668.20 → 1668.78] servants

[1670.02 → 1670.48] not know his
[1670.48 → 1671.24] master's business

[1682.16 → 1682.70] fruit that
[1682.70 → 1683.16] will last
[1683.16 → 1684.00] and so
[1684.00 → 1684.34] that whatever
[1684.34 → 1684.80] you ask
[1684.80 → 1685.22] in my name

[1694.16 → 1694.72] loving like
[1694.72 → 1695.10] Christ
[1695.10 → 1697.48] and that
[1697.48 → 1698.20] love comes
[1698.20 → 1699.06] from Christ
[1699.06 → 1699.42] and from
[1699.42 → 1699.88] his spirit
