[0.58 → 4.92] Well, before we take up an offering, I want to share a bit of a story that will make sense of it.
[6.00 → 11.94] About six, almost seven years ago now, Pastor Sid got a call from another pastor at Relate Church,
[12.20 → 16.08] and he said, hey, I want to visit you. And the pastor came by, and he said, you know, we're so
[16.08 → 19.34] thankful you're building this building in Clayton. You're going to reach people here. You're going to
[19.34 → 24.36] bless people here that our church can't reach, and we want to give you this gift of $25,000
[24.36 → 29.00] to support the work that you're doing here. And we were very surprised by that. I remember Sid
[29.00 → 33.84] just saying how that caught him way off guard. And we've not forgotten that, and we've often
[33.84 → 37.18] prayed for opportunities where we can pass that blessing forward. And so this Sunday, we're going
[37.18 → 41.66] to do that. Just over a year ago, the church that Joe just prayed for, NUMA Church, they planted in
[41.66 → 45.30] Surrey, in South Surrey. And you can imagine all the challenges that come with planting. They
[45.30 → 50.32] literally started in lockdown. And we want to take time now to bless them. They've been resilient.
[50.44 → 54.66] They've been creative. They do a lot of stuff outside. And we know that it's been a tough season
[54.66 → 58.60] for them as a church plant. And so we want to bless them. And we just want to invite you to give
[58.60 → 61.68] generously to them in the same way that we've been given too generously. And even though you
[61.68 → 65.28] don't know them, we're looking forward to going on our behalf of this community and saying,
[65.38 → 69.36] hey, NUMA Church, we can't reach South Surrey. We're not planted there. And we want to bless
[69.36 → 73.78] you as a church and the leadership there. And so the way we can give to that is through
[73.78 → 77.08] our Church Centre app. You can also, if you go home, you can go online and give to that.
[77.16 → 81.28] You'll see one of the things as a headline is church planting, NUMA Church, so you can't
[81.28 → 84.44] miss it. But if you don't want to get behind church planting, every year for Thanksgiving,
[84.44 → 88.22] we also give money to the Surrey Food Bank. And you're more than welcome to do that.
[88.32 → 91.62] So we're going to take time in this service. You can pull out your phones, and you can give
[91.62 → 95.18] to either of those causes. You can download the Church Centre app. And if you don't want
[95.18 → 98.70] to do that, we just encourage you to grab your phone and text someone and say why you're
[98.70 → 101.60] thankful for them. And while we're doing that, you're going to enjoy some beautiful music.
[101.60 → 105.28] grateful the praise be here and of orange.
[105.42 → 108.48] Peru, the members are coming in with the
[108.48 → 110.96] yellow channel. So and all right, we're going to enjoy the
[110.96 → 114.70] beautiful totalmente-blue. It'she Stan.
[114.70 → 122.40] So we're from the variate abuse, we're going to look this week.
[122.40 → 127.48] So, I'm excited to go home for watching this post.
[127.48 → 157.46] Thank you.
[157.48 → 187.46] Thank you.
[187.48 → 217.46] Thank you.
[217.48 → 219.48] Thank you.
[219.48 → 221.48] Thank you.
[247.48 → 249.48] Thank you.
[249.48 → 251.48] Thank you.
[251.48 → 253.48] Thank you.
[253.48 → 255.48] Thank you.
[255.48 → 257.48] Thank you.
[257.48 → 287.48] 
[287.48 → 289.48] Thank you.
[289.48 → 291.48] Thank you.
[291.48 → 321.48] 
[321.48 → 323.48] Thank you.
[323.48 → 325.48] Thank you.
[325.48 → 327.48] Thank you.
[327.48 → 329.48] Thank you.
[329.48 → 331.48] Thank you.
[331.48 → 333.48] Thank you.
[333.48 → 335.48] Thank you.
[335.48 → 337.48] Thank you.
[337.48 → 342.40] lockdowns. And it often happens, so much so that journalists now track it, where when people emerge
[342.40 → 347.92] from a lockdown, they often find their way to a mall and they go nuts. Now, who's done that? I'm
[347.92 → 351.90] just kidding. Don't worry about it. And this is a phenomenon, not just here in North America, it's
[351.90 → 355.58] around the world. In major cities, when people get out of a lockdown, they just go crazy, and they warm
[355.58 → 360.34] up those visa cards, and they just start revenge spending. And when I heard Jim describe this to
[360.34 → 365.54] me, and now I've read it since then, I have to say it's surprising, and it's unsettling to me. It
[365.54 → 369.44] doesn't make sense, and it's irrational. Let me just say a few reasons why I just don't understand
[369.44 → 375.04] this. Number one, people are spending in ways they would not have otherwise spent with revenge
[375.04 → 378.80] spending. They're spending on things they had no interest in, but now that they got out of lockdown,
[379.12 → 383.20] they're just going crazy. You know, they're buying that new article of clothing, that new technology,
[383.32 → 387.76] that new TV, even new cars. And I have to think, man, if you live in Australia, and you're doing
[387.76 → 393.98] revenge spending, you're going broke quickly. You know, and I just think, secondly, how strange it is
[393.98 → 398.02] that we think somehow that hitting the mall and spending money is going to deal with that anxiety,
[398.18 → 402.50] that stress, that frustration we have with COVID. You're not getting back at COVID with revenge by
[402.50 → 407.30] buying that new TV, which is just going to give you more anxiety-inducing news just on a bigger screen
[407.30 → 413.14] now, right? But thirdly, it may be more, you know, concerning for me is thought of all the things
[413.14 → 419.66] that we could do when we come out of lockdowns, the ways we could spend our time. I'm not reading news
[419.66 → 426.96] about revenge hospitality, revenge serving your neighbours with great need, or revenge generosity.
[427.14 → 431.78] I'm sure there are stories, but what's making the news is revenge spending, which predominantly is on
[431.78 → 437.06] ourselves. You know, what a statement about how we come out of lockdown, revenge spending.
[438.94 → 444.04] Now, this passage in 1 Corinthians 8, it's unmistakably about giving. It's about generosity.
[444.20 → 449.28] It's about how you and I live with our money, which I read this week is people's least favourite thing
[449.66 → 454.00] sermon on and pastor's least favourite thing to preach on. You know, happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
[454.16 → 459.80] I love you very much. But here we go. Money. You know, Pastor Sid, if you were here last week,
[459.82 → 465.46] even mentioned before the offering that the way we give is an act of worship. I thought that was
[465.46 → 469.48] fitting. We want to talk about money in the church. We need to talk about money in the church because
[469.48 → 473.94] it's a matter of our hearts, right? Our bank statements, our barometers of our commitments,
[474.58 → 479.48] our ambitions, what we love. And we want to recognize that our money matters.
[480.38 → 484.76] And if discipleship is an act of bringing the whole of our lives under the lordship of Jesus,
[484.96 → 488.52] and I think that's a good way of thinking about it, discipleship is bringing every part of your
[488.52 → 494.12] life under the lordship of Jesus. If that's true, that how you and I spend and use our money
[494.12 → 501.06] matters a great deal, not just to us as a church, but to God. And so we're going to talk about it.
[501.06 → 508.08] Now, one of the things that is often missed in many of Paul's letters is his encouragement to the
[508.08 → 512.94] churches to give. In so many of his letters to Galatians and to the Thessalonians and to Romans
[512.94 → 517.60] and all these different churches, he has no problem saying, hey, I'm coming there in a few months' time,
[517.66 → 521.44] and I'm going to take this collection, and I'm going to use the money that you set aside as a church
[521.44 → 525.82] to care for this church in need, to help plant this church, to help people in ministry, to care for
[525.82 → 530.62] the needs of the city. He has no problem saying, hey, look, the collection is coming. You know, even
[530.62 → 535.68] more, you would say, Romans, which is a very, you know, if you grew up in the church, Romans is sort
[535.68 → 539.66] of this big theological book, and many people have looked at Romans saying, why is Paul writing this?
[539.70 → 543.64] And I know some of our women are studying Romans right now. And finally, at the end of this book,
[543.74 → 547.64] Paul's saying, hey, I'm swinging by on the way to Spain, and I want you to set aside a collection
[547.64 → 551.82] because we want to care for this ministry forward. We want to plant more churches. We want to continue the
[551.82 → 554.94] work of ministry. And Paul has no problem over and over saying,
[554.94 → 561.82] we want you to give. I want you to get behind this ministry. The reason is, for Paul, generosity is just
[561.82 → 566.92] what churches do. When people come to faith in Jesus, when they recognize who they are in Jesus,
[567.00 → 571.24] we're going to come to that. Part of what it means to be following Jesus is pouring out your life in
[571.24 → 577.02] generosity. Not just your money, your time, your resources, but certainly including the money. And so Paul
[577.02 → 582.80] says, hey, I'm coming, and I look forward to seeing how you're generously giving. But that brings us to the
[582.80 → 586.36] interesting story of Corinthians. And this is why I picked Corinthians, because I think it's such an
[586.36 → 589.96] interesting story about money. The Corinthian church, number one, you should know, is one of
[589.96 → 594.26] the wealthier churches at that time. It's a very wealthy city. But Paul writes two letters to them,
[594.32 → 598.32] two longer letters. In fact, they get more attention than all the other churches, which suggests to me
[598.32 → 602.12] that this church has a lot to deal with. And people have said it's probably the messiest,
[602.40 → 607.60] most complicated church of all the ones he planted. But in the first letter, Paul just gives a little
[607.60 → 612.72] statement at the end saying, hey, Corinth, I'm going to swing by, and I want to take this collection,
[612.84 → 615.66] I'm going to bring it down to the church in Jerusalem. And the reason we know from other
[615.66 → 620.20] writings is that Jerusalem had a major famine, and the churches there had major need, and Paul was
[620.20 → 624.18] taking money from all the other churches that weren't in as severe famine to bless Jerusalem
[624.18 → 628.60] churches and those going through the famine. That's why the collection happened. But then we get to the
[628.60 → 633.24] second letter Paul writes to the Corinthian church, and we realize something's changed.
[633.24 → 638.54] Because what was just a little, almost a sort of end of his letter note about generosity in the
[638.54 → 644.32] first book, or the first letter, is now two full chapters of sort of confronting the church,
[644.38 → 649.82] you might say, about their lack of generosity. And again, Paul has no issue saying, hey, let's talk
[649.82 → 656.08] about this. This is important. And we don't know the reasons. I wish we did. But we know that the
[656.08 → 660.94] Corinthian church started out giving money. They were a generous church. They had resources to share.
[660.94 → 667.04] But something along the way changed that, and they stopped giving. So Paul says, we're going to talk
[667.04 → 670.54] about giving. We're going to talk about your money. We're going to talk about what it means to be
[670.54 → 676.86] followers of Jesus, caring for the needs of others in this time and this place. And again, this for Paul
[676.86 → 684.52] is discipleship. This is loving your neighbour. This is serving with your resources. And so let's take a
[684.52 → 690.50] look at what Paul does. First, let me highlight what Paul doesn't do. If you've ever been to a fundraiser,
[690.50 → 695.86] as I'm sure many of us have, sometimes you can get frustrated by being manipulated.
[696.52 → 699.88] Ever had that? Where someone's like sort of gimmicky, and they want your money, and they manipulate you?
[700.54 → 705.26] Paul does not do that in this passage. He doesn't shame the church. He doesn't guilt the church. And
[705.26 → 709.26] he certainly doesn't try to coerce the church. I think those are really unhealthy ways of trying
[709.26 → 713.70] to get people to give. What he does is, he says, hey, let me tell you the story about this church in
[713.70 → 719.00] Macedonia. And let me focus your hearts on Jesus. That's what Paul does. That's the general flow of what he
[719.00 → 723.34] does in chapters 8 and chapters 9. He says, this is a story I want you to share, to know about from
[723.34 → 730.18] Macedonia. And let's focus on Jesus. So we're going to do that this morning. Listen to what Paul says
[730.18 → 737.24] about the churches in Macedonia. He says, in the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy
[737.24 → 744.86] and their extreme poverty welled up in what? Rich generosity. And Paul just drives this one home.
[744.86 → 749.04] He keeps going. He says, they, the Macedonian believers, urgently pleaded with us for the
[749.04 → 754.06] privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord's people. They went beyond our expectations.
[755.16 → 758.90] You catching the movement there? The Macedonians heard about what was going on in Jerusalem,
[759.02 → 763.00] the famine perhaps, and they said, hey, hey, Paul, come here. We might not have a lot. We might be
[763.00 → 767.08] going through an extreme trial, but we want to serve the needs of those in the Jerusalem church who
[767.08 → 772.46] are getting hit hard by this famine. Let us help you. That's the posture of the Macedonian church.
[772.46 → 776.80] And, you know, I can't help but think this must sting a little bit. Paul's saying, you need to know this.
[777.78 → 780.30] And it must hurt a little bit for the Corinthian church to know that, you know,
[780.38 → 785.18] they're aware of their wealth. They know that their wealth are the Macedonians. And Paul's saying,
[785.24 → 791.38] hey, did you see how they're so extravagant in their care? And the obvious question for them is,
[791.82 → 798.52] why aren't you doing that? Why aren't you joining in on caring for those in need? What's holding you back,
[798.90 → 802.06] Corinthian church, from pouring out your love and your concern for them
[802.06 → 807.00] in generosity, in resources? And I happen to think that's a good question for every church
[807.00 → 814.02] and every time in every city. What's holding you back? What's the reason that's keeping you
[814.02 → 821.00] from giving generously, sacrificially? And I know in the back of at least five of our minds is the
[821.00 → 825.98] Vancouver real estate market is actually what's holding us back. But aside from that, and even,
[826.18 → 830.06] I would say, in spite of that, and I have a lot of respect for people in our church who have made
[830.06 → 833.74] financial decisions so that they don't need to be constantly pouring into a huge mortgage,
[833.86 → 841.86] but still living generously. What's holding us back? But then secondly, Paul looks at Jesus. He
[841.86 → 846.22] focuses the eyes and the hearts of the Corinthian church on Jesus. And I want to read for you what
[846.22 → 849.56] he says in verse nine. Paul says,
[849.56 → 855.84] For you know that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake
[855.84 → 862.64] became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich. Let me just say at the outset,
[862.76 → 866.96] this is one of those passages that people have really twisted in dangerous ways, where preachers
[866.96 → 870.56] have from pulpits said, hey, if you just give a little seed money to the pastor, personal checks,
[870.80 → 876.76] and I buy myself a jet, God's going to make all of us rich. That is not what Paul is saying. And I'm
[876.76 → 880.92] going to walk through this slowly so we hear what Paul is saying in this passage. Jesus' richness
[880.92 → 887.08] here, first, is describing his pre-earthly state. That is to say, Jesus did not come into
[887.08 → 892.64] existence in Bethlehem. Did you know that? Jesus existed for all eternity with the Father and with
[892.64 → 900.74] the Spirit. He's fully God forever before Bethlehem, right? And Jesus deliberately descends to poverty.
[901.24 → 906.20] He deliberately descends to a family in need. He deliberately descends to a barn in Bethlehem.
[906.76 → 910.84] And that's just the beginning of Jesus' life of descent. You know, Pastor Sid again, he quoted
[910.84 → 915.32] Philippians 2 last week. Philippians 2 happens to be my wedding passage, so I don't forget this one.
[915.58 → 920.00] But it shows how Jesus, in his pre-earthly state, full of glory, he takes on flesh. He doesn't just
[920.00 → 924.06] take on flesh, he takes on the posture of a servant, of a slave. And in John 13, which we looked at,
[924.10 → 929.44] Jesus washing the feet, the muck off of the feet of his disciples. And that's just the beginning,
[929.52 → 934.42] because he goes down even further from there to the furthest point of descent, and that is the cross
[934.42 → 940.76] itself. Emptying himself of all that he is for the sake of his world and for the sake of our liberation.
[942.68 → 950.72] And in all that, Paul says, that makes us rich. And again, he's not talking about money.
[952.14 → 956.08] The New Testament has a different, a variety of ways, I should say, of talking about the richness we
[956.08 → 963.42] have in Christ. And when you become a believer in Jesus, when you start following Jesus, you are
[963.42 → 968.18] filled with his riches. To believe in Jesus is to be grafted into the community where you are now
[968.18 → 973.34] freed from the power of sin, the enslaving power of sin. He liberates you from that by the cross.
[974.22 → 978.30] To become a Christian is to be grafted into the community where you're filled with the power of
[978.30 → 983.64] the Spirit. The very life of Jesus by the Spirit is at work in this community. Again, liberating,
[984.14 → 989.82] re-humanizing, to use that word, making us how Christ created us to live. That's the riches we
[989.82 → 994.96] have in Christ. But there's more than that. I mean, we read in 1 Peter this glorious inheritance that we
[994.96 → 1000.76] have being in Christ. And that glorious inheritance is saying we're marked by the Spirit to receive the
[1000.76 → 1006.52] fullness of what's coming when Jesus returns. And as Joe prayed, not only do we have the comfort
[1006.52 → 1012.90] of being with Christ if we die, but we have the hope that when Jesus returns, we get new bodies
[1012.90 → 1020.46] and a new creation to live in forever, in a purified, perfected creation. Do you know the riches we have
[1020.46 → 1026.10] in Christ? I think COVID happens to be, especially those last things, happens to be a good time for us
[1026.10 → 1031.12] to say, wow, the comfort and hope we have of being in Christ. Not even death holds us back
[1031.12 → 1037.62] from hope and renewal and resurrection. This is the riches we have in Jesus. And for Paul, when we take
[1037.62 → 1044.10] to heart these riches, when we realize what we have in God, it leads to both gratitude and at least
[1044.10 → 1049.04] generosity. It leads to a recognition that God, our Heavenly Father, knows our needs. He provides for us
[1049.04 → 1055.58] in every conceivable way. And that leads us to say, now we can participate in reflecting God's generosity
[1055.58 → 1062.04] with the whole of our lives. Gratitude and generosity. And I don't want to spend a lot of
[1062.04 → 1066.18] time on this, but I think it's obvious to all of us that this definitely runs into conflict with a
[1066.18 → 1072.00] cultural narrative, where the self is at the centre. And the way we satisfy the self is by consumption,
[1072.74 → 1078.38] by revenge spending, right? There's a billionaire by the name of Howard Hughes who was interviewed by a
[1078.38 → 1082.82] young woman who asked him the question, what would it take to make you happy? How much money would it
[1082.82 → 1089.52] take for you to be happy? You know what his answer was? Just a little more. Just a little more money
[1089.52 → 1095.38] that I'll be happy. But what Howard Hughes says is nothing new. And the 19th century economist John
[1095.38 → 1101.90] Stuart Mill wrote once that human beings are, quote, creatures that long to obtain the greatest amount of
[1101.90 → 1107.80] necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries with the smallest quantity of labour and physical self-denial.
[1109.38 → 1112.52] And what's interesting to me about John Stuart Mill's quote is that he's just saying,
[1112.52 → 1116.24] this is just how we are as humans. This is just the way we operate. We want the most for the least.
[1116.30 → 1119.78] We want to sort of gather in the most benefit for the least amount of work for ourselves.
[1122.16 → 1124.92] And I want to remind us in light of what we read in the New Testament,
[1125.68 → 1128.22] that Howard Hughes and John Stuart Mill, they got it dead wrong.
[1129.32 → 1131.32] They got it dead wrong in our story.
[1132.14 → 1135.66] You might say they got it right if you read the world to the lens of Genesis 3,
[1135.66 → 1138.82] the fall and the rebellion of our human condition.
[1140.02 → 1144.88] But in the New Testament, we read light, we read about money in light of what God created us to be,
[1145.38 → 1149.30] how he created us to live, and how he one day will reform our whole world to be.
[1150.32 → 1155.24] And our story starts with a generous God who places us in an abundant creation
[1155.24 → 1160.20] to enjoy, develop, and just be experiencing the goodness that he gives us in this world.
[1160.20 → 1164.06] And if it's true that we are created in the image of this generous God,
[1164.16 → 1167.58] we will reflect his generosity in the whole of our lives.
[1168.72 → 1171.88] And if you're new to the Christian faith, or you're just thinking about the Christian faith,
[1171.94 → 1172.88] I should just say at the outset,
[1174.12 → 1176.92] that in God's economy, and in Jesus' kingdom,
[1177.82 → 1179.44] he takes greedy, selfish people,
[1179.72 → 1183.22] and he forms them into loving, selfless, generous people.
[1183.82 → 1185.58] And I know if I had time to talk with you,
[1185.64 → 1187.18] and this is even a piece of my own story,
[1187.18 → 1191.14] that what Jesus does is we relinquish our control as he makes us open-handed people
[1191.14 → 1193.60] who care a lot less about stuff,
[1194.06 → 1197.34] and a lot more about how we can bless others with all that we have,
[1197.78 → 1199.00] and all the time we've been given.
[1200.12 → 1201.52] That's where Jesus takes us.
[1201.76 → 1204.36] And I know many of our testimonies echo that reality.
[1206.42 → 1208.52] Over the last number of years, my father-in-law, Mike Green,
[1208.52 → 1213.80] has been compiling statements that sort of mark the church in distinction from our cultural story.
[1213.80 → 1218.22] And there are two phrases he uses that I have thought are very poignant
[1218.22 → 1220.04] when we think about this passage on giving.
[1220.66 → 1222.90] The first one is that the community, the church,
[1223.32 → 1226.74] is a community of thankfulness in a world of entitlement.
[1227.74 → 1228.40] I like that.
[1228.80 → 1232.60] The church is a community of gratitude in a world of entitlement.
[1233.40 → 1236.76] But secondly, the church is a community of generosity
[1236.76 → 1240.26] and enough in the world of consumption.
[1240.26 → 1243.32] And it's worth just asking,
[1243.52 → 1247.48] which story shapes our daily lives Monday to Saturday?
[1248.26 → 1251.36] Is it the story of entitlement and consumption?
[1251.96 → 1255.08] Or is it the story of gratitude and generosity?
[1255.26 → 1256.20] Because that's our story.
[1257.54 → 1260.14] And I should say, while I'm on this topic of generosity,
[1260.36 → 1262.82] that one of the things I have grown to love about our church,
[1263.08 → 1264.06] and I do mean this,
[1264.70 → 1267.60] is on the whole, I've found that our church is incredibly generous.
[1267.60 → 1270.68] And I've found that even in the midst of COVID,
[1270.88 → 1272.62] we've been praying as leaders and pastors
[1272.62 → 1274.76] that this would be a season where we step up as a church
[1274.76 → 1275.96] and we see the needs,
[1276.18 → 1278.02] and we don't just think about what's right in front of us
[1278.02 → 1278.72] as our own community,
[1278.78 → 1280.06] but how we can bless the city
[1280.06 → 1282.18] and we can bless those around us who are in need.
[1282.84 → 1284.84] And this week, I emailed Linda Wing, our bookkeeper,
[1285.02 → 1287.14] and I said, okay, here are the things I know we gave to,
[1287.48 → 1289.36] and here's what I think we gave to those causes.
[1289.56 → 1290.92] And you know, pastors, we can exaggerate.
[1291.06 → 1293.74] So I wanted to make sure that the numbers I had in my mind
[1293.74 → 1295.18] were the numbers she gave back to me.
[1295.18 → 1296.42] And when Linda emailed me back,
[1296.52 → 1298.00] it turns out that almost every time
[1298.00 → 1300.46] I thought we gave this much, we gave way more than that.
[1301.20 → 1303.10] And I just paused and looked at that set of numbers.
[1303.20 → 1304.06] I said, praise the Lord
[1304.06 → 1306.62] for the way that our church has gotten behind so many causes.
[1306.70 → 1308.06] And some of them, we just show up, you know,
[1308.10 → 1309.58] on Sunday morning and say, here's the need, you know,
[1309.62 → 1310.74] the Indigenous Water Project.
[1311.02 → 1312.46] And I just could not believe the way people are like,
[1312.48 → 1313.34] yep, I'm giving to that.
[1314.00 → 1315.94] Or the Adams Road Breakfast Program.
[1316.46 → 1317.70] People gave piles of money to that.
[1318.04 → 1319.44] The Water Project in Sierra Leone,
[1319.52 → 1320.66] the Coverdale Community Kitchen,
[1320.92 → 1322.74] the abuse victim care that we care,
[1322.74 → 1324.70] we have for people in the season
[1324.70 → 1325.92] who've experienced domestic abuse.
[1326.14 → 1327.74] And that's not even to mention the care fund
[1327.74 → 1328.56] for our own church.
[1328.74 → 1330.50] So the people can receive counselling,
[1330.90 → 1332.36] help with rent, whatever the needs are.
[1332.44 → 1334.80] I think, wow, Lord, just in this season,
[1334.90 → 1335.68] just in this year,
[1335.74 → 1337.70] I've seen incredible generosity in our church.
[1337.98 → 1338.98] And I thank him for it.
[1339.86 → 1341.80] And to those of you who over the last number of months too,
[1342.64 → 1343.84] who've called me out of the blue to say,
[1343.92 → 1344.84] hey, Dave, where are the needs?
[1345.48 → 1346.84] I feel called to give to this.
[1346.96 → 1347.88] I just want to say thank you.
[1348.74 → 1350.28] You know, we get tough calls about COVID,
[1350.28 → 1352.34] but we get beautiful calls about generosity.
[1352.92 → 1354.26] And I'm so grateful for that.
[1356.76 → 1359.34] The verse that I found myself focused on the most
[1359.34 → 1363.20] in this passage comes right before Paul talks about Jesus,
[1364.10 → 1365.14] where he says to them,
[1365.50 → 1367.86] I'm not trying to command you here to give.
[1368.36 → 1368.74] And I love that.
[1368.76 → 1369.78] I'm not commanding you to give,
[1370.04 → 1372.34] but I am testing the sincerity of your love.
[1373.04 → 1373.68] Think about that.
[1374.40 → 1375.64] I'm not commanding you to give.
[1375.74 → 1377.10] In fact, Paul doesn't even talk about
[1377.10 → 1379.64] the Old Testament example of tithing,
[1379.96 → 1382.08] which is sort of setting aside 10% of your money,
[1382.16 → 1383.94] of your resources to give back to God.
[1383.98 → 1385.78] And I grew up in a family where that was expected.
[1386.02 → 1387.98] So grateful for parents who formed me
[1387.98 → 1389.78] to sort of see 10% of my income
[1389.78 → 1390.84] as always going to the church.
[1390.90 → 1392.18] And if I want to give more to that, I can.
[1392.46 → 1393.48] But that practice of saying,
[1393.58 → 1395.44] this is God's, and I'm going to give this away.
[1395.90 → 1397.16] Paul doesn't even resort to that,
[1397.22 → 1398.48] which I think is an excellent practice.
[1398.58 → 1401.22] He says, I want you to express love.
[1401.22 → 1403.96] I want you to see the need,
[1404.16 → 1404.98] the famine in Jerusalem.
[1405.12 → 1405.86] I want you to care.
[1406.18 → 1407.64] I want you to love them.
[1408.12 → 1409.08] I want your giving not to be
[1409.08 → 1410.62] because Paul's breathing down your neck
[1410.62 → 1411.82] saying you've got to give this amount of money.
[1412.04 → 1412.76] He says, I want you to give
[1412.76 → 1414.50] that's flowing out of a heart
[1414.50 → 1416.00] for the surrounding needs,
[1416.42 → 1417.66] not begrudging those
[1417.66 → 1419.32] who are taking money away from you,
[1419.38 → 1420.50] money that God's given you.
[1421.32 → 1422.24] You see the difference there?
[1423.22 → 1424.38] That's a huge piece.
[1424.54 → 1427.72] I want you to be generous because you love.
[1428.36 → 1429.72] This is how you serve your neighbours.
[1429.72 → 1431.24] This is how you serve your brothers and sisters
[1431.24 → 1431.80] in other cities.
[1432.06 → 1433.78] This is how you can get on board
[1433.78 → 1435.26] with God's mission in the world.
[1436.40 → 1436.76] Generosity.
[1439.48 → 1440.78] Now I want to close with a story
[1440.78 → 1442.10] that actually comes from my own life
[1442.10 → 1443.80] or my family's life in 2014.
[1444.48 → 1445.34] Before coming to Hope,
[1445.76 → 1447.36] Brittany and I had to spend a season in Michigan
[1447.36 → 1449.58] so I could finish my master's
[1449.58 → 1450.98] and get ordained as a pastor.
[1451.56 → 1452.56] And if you knew me at that time,
[1452.60 → 1455.28] you'll know that I had some frustration around that
[1455.28 → 1457.26] because I was happy with my degree from regent,
[1457.26 → 1459.72] but I had to go to Michigan for Calvin
[1459.72 → 1460.70] to kick the tires on me
[1460.70 → 1462.22] and make sure I wasn't a heretic and all that.
[1463.08 → 1464.10] But we had to uproot our family.
[1464.20 → 1465.28] We had to drive across the country.
[1465.46 → 1466.42] We had to pay hefty tuition.
[1466.58 → 1467.40] I had to stop working,
[1467.56 → 1468.46] which for me was frustrating
[1468.46 → 1469.62] because I knew that stopping working
[1469.62 → 1471.60] means our income was going to go way down.
[1471.78 → 1473.12] And it's the first time as a married couple
[1473.12 → 1474.44] where we were just flat broke.
[1474.90 → 1476.68] And I will admit that that was hard for me.
[1476.96 → 1478.12] And I know there's many in our church
[1478.12 → 1479.04] who've gone through way more,
[1479.20 → 1481.48] but you understand it's hard when you're not working.
[1482.34 → 1484.18] So anyway, we get to Calvin
[1484.18 → 1485.56] and we're doing our studies there.
[1485.82 → 1487.04] And at Canadian Thanksgiving,
[1487.58 → 1488.60] remember we're in the States,
[1489.14 → 1491.00] I was so grateful for a wife who reminded us
[1491.00 → 1493.28] that we're celebrating Thanksgiving on Canada time.
[1493.36 → 1495.14] So she put a poster up in our kitchen.
[1495.66 → 1497.76] And on the poster, she wrote the word Eucharist
[1497.76 → 1499.06] and actually brought it for this service.
[1499.62 → 1501.14] I forgot this for the 9 a.m. service.
[1501.22 → 1501.72] And here it is.
[1502.22 → 1503.06] It's getting a bit old now.
[1503.92 → 1506.52] But we had this on our kitchen wall
[1506.52 → 1508.20] that was put up at Thanksgiving.
[1508.20 → 1510.62] And it ended up just being something we kept on our wall
[1510.62 → 1511.80] right up until we left.
[1512.50 → 1514.42] And we filled it in slowly with our kids.
[1515.30 → 1517.54] And this poster was one of the things
[1517.54 → 1520.16] that in a season where I wasn't exceptionally grateful,
[1520.98 → 1522.08] this ministered to me
[1522.08 → 1524.12] and reminded me of the basic ways
[1524.12 → 1525.52] that God is generous to us,
[1525.98 → 1527.14] the way He cares for us,
[1527.18 → 1528.00] the way He provides for us,
[1528.02 → 1528.92] the way He loves us.
[1529.10 → 1531.14] And even having my kids fill in parts of this
[1531.14 → 1533.70] reminded me of just the incredible generosity
[1533.70 → 1534.50] of our Heavenly Father.
[1534.50 → 1536.88] And I happen to wonder,
[1537.46 → 1538.28] is this not a season
[1538.28 → 1539.78] where you might want to take this practice home?
[1540.30 → 1541.30] You know, we did it as a church.
[1541.58 → 1542.76] And, you know, goodness,
[1542.86 → 1544.26] if you want to take some time after the service,
[1544.36 → 1545.66] I was just reading a couple over there
[1545.66 → 1547.68] and there's one statement of gratitude
[1547.68 → 1549.50] where someone wrote,
[1549.58 → 1551.86] I'm thankful that God kept my wife alive from cancer.
[1553.36 → 1554.18] God is good.
[1555.38 → 1557.62] And we need to stop and give thanks
[1557.62 → 1559.96] and live in the posture of gratitude.
[1560.12 → 1561.66] As Misha said, not just on one Sunday,
[1562.14 → 1563.44] not just on one day of the year,
[1563.44 → 1565.50] but we need to live in a posture of gratitude.
[1565.64 → 1566.40] And I do encourage you,
[1566.46 → 1568.30] as families, as roommates perhaps,
[1568.86 → 1569.86] take a piece of paper,
[1570.00 → 1571.02] put it on your kitchen wall,
[1571.38 → 1572.64] and start filling in the ways
[1572.64 → 1574.14] that God is generous and good to you
[1574.14 → 1575.64] and allow that to minister to you.
[1577.50 → 1578.54] This passage
[1578.54 → 1583.04] is not about God
[1583.04 → 1584.40] or not about Paul just saying,
[1584.50 → 1585.00] I need your money.
[1586.30 → 1588.08] This passage is about the generosity
[1588.08 → 1589.04] of our Heavenly Father.
[1590.58 → 1592.08] This passage is about the riches
[1592.08 → 1594.44] that believers have in Christ.
[1594.76 → 1596.34] Riches we so often forget about,
[1596.60 → 1597.42] so often minimize,
[1597.62 → 1599.28] so often have our eyes off of.
[1600.32 → 1602.68] But this passage is also about Paul saying to the church,
[1603.38 → 1605.50] God wants you to participate in his mission
[1605.50 → 1607.08] through your generosity.
[1608.02 → 1609.68] He wants you to see the needs
[1609.68 → 1612.54] and out of love flowing from your hearts,
[1613.00 → 1615.16] giving to the causes where you can bless.
[1616.44 → 1617.64] That's what we're called to be.
[1617.64 → 1620.60] That's what it means to serve with our resources.
[1621.32 → 1622.96] And what a beautiful thing it is
[1622.96 → 1624.08] when the church is known
[1624.08 → 1626.20] as a community of generosity
[1626.20 → 1627.92] in a world of entitlement.
[1629.08 → 1629.62] Let's pray.
[1634.22 → 1635.68] Father, we thank you for your word.
[1637.48 → 1639.38] We pray that we would hear it for what it is,
[1639.44 → 1641.40] that we would feel the challenge we need to feel,
[1641.48 → 1642.74] the encouragement we need to feel.
[1643.60 → 1645.32] But Lord, I ask that we would see you
[1645.32 → 1646.78] for the generous Father you are.
[1648.66 → 1650.38] I pray that we would see the blessings
[1650.38 → 1651.78] you pour into our lives,
[1651.90 → 1652.96] blessings we do not deserve.
[1654.36 → 1656.76] And I pray that you would increase our desire
[1656.76 → 1658.24] to pour our lives out
[1658.24 → 1659.84] for the blessing of those around us.
[1660.50 → 1661.92] Help us to see the needs.
[1662.80 → 1664.26] Help us to give joyfully
[1664.26 → 1666.16] and sacrificially.
[1667.02 → 1668.40] And I pray that those words
[1668.40 → 1669.64] that Paul wrote
[1669.64 → 1671.32] over the Macedonian churches
[1671.32 → 1672.42] would be true for hope,
[1672.42 → 1675.30] that we welled up with generosity,
[1675.90 → 1677.54] that we pleaded for the opportunity
[1677.54 → 1679.20] to care for those around us
[1679.20 → 1680.76] because we know what we have
[1680.76 → 1682.44] and we know how we've been called.
[1683.18 → 1684.38] We pray this in Christ's name.
[1684.72 → 1684.96] Amen.
[1686.84 → 1688.08] I invite you to stand with me
[1688.08 → 1689.22] and sing a song of response.
[1689.22 → 1689.42] Thank you.
[1689.42 → 1719.40] Thank you.
