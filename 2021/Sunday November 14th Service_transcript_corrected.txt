[0.00 → 8.36] well good morning hope it's a gift to gather around the scriptures again this week this morning
[8.36 → 12.94] we're going to be looking at the way in which we're called to serve our vulnerable neighbours
[12.94 → 18.28] this morning, and you should know this is a makeup sermon for pastor SID he was supposed to preach on
[18.28 → 22.64] this two weeks ago, but he didn't he preached instead on our own brokenness and the way in
[22.64 → 26.78] which we're called to deal with our own hearts and how god invites us to serve in our brokenness
[26.78 → 30.78] and we forgive him because it was an amazing sermon and if you haven't listened to it, I do
[30.78 → 35.54] commend it to you, it was a word and season for all of us but this morning we're looking at
[35.54 → 40.10] the way in which we are called to serve our brothers and sisters who are vulnerable and so for that i
[40.10 → 44.82] invite you to turn with me to Luke chapter 7 we're going to look at a story of hospitality
[44.82 → 50.10] it says Luke chapter 7 verse 36 so if you have your bible or your phone scroll with me or turn with
[50.10 → 51.10] me to that passage
[51.10 → 64.68] when one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee's house
[64.68 → 70.58] and reclined at the table a woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating
[70.58 → 77.14] at the Pharisee's house so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume as she stood behind him at his
[77.14 → 83.86] feet weeping she began to wet his feet with her tears and she wiped them with her hair kissed them
[83.86 → 90.42] and poured perfume on them when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself
[90.42 → 96.26] if this man were a prophet he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is
[96.26 → 104.18] that she is a sinner Jesus answered him Simon I have something to tell you tell me teacher he said
[104.18 → 111.08] two people owed money to a certain moneylender one owed him 500 denarii and the other 50 neither
[111.08 → 116.06] of them had the money to pay him back so he forgave the debts of both now which of them will love him
[116.06 → 123.02] more Simon replied I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven you've judged correctly Jesus said
[123.02 → 130.02] then he turned towards the woman and said to Simon do you see this woman I came into your house
[130.02 → 134.98] you did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her
[134.98 → 140.60] hair you did not give me a kiss but this woman from the time I entered has not stopped kissing my feet
[140.60 → 146.94] you did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet therefore I tell you her many
[146.94 → 152.96] sins have been forgiven as her great love has shown but whoever has been forgiven little
[152.96 → 162.26] loves little and Jesus said to her your sins are forgiven the other guests began to say among
[162.26 → 171.86] themselves who is this who even forgives sins Jesus said to the woman your faith has saved you go in peace
[171.86 → 182.96] well not that long ago there's a conference a Christian conference and the speaker was asked
[182.96 → 187.66] to give a 30-minute talk on justice and the way in which the church is called to serve the poor the
[187.66 → 193.56] margins of society, and he began that conference with a very vivid illustration he brought with him a bible
[193.56 → 197.96] but it wasn't just a bible that looked like this it was very tattered you could tell there's something
[197.96 → 203.56] different about it as he sort of flipped through the pages it was obvious that there was a lot missing
[203.56 → 208.50] and then there are pages that bent there are pages that were missing and obviously there's something
[208.50 → 214.74] going on, and he said before I came to this conference to speak on this I went through my bible and I cut out
[214.74 → 221.66] and ripped out every verse that talks about justice every verse that talks about god's love for the poor
[221.66 → 227.70] every verse about the oppressed the marginalized the people that Jesus loves and invites the church to
[227.70 → 233.28] serve I ripped out every passage around that, and he held up this bible that was in tatters
[233.28 → 243.22] and basically said if we don't concern ourselves and serve the margins of society we are not reading
[243.22 → 250.78] the bible or I would put it differently perhaps we're reading it, and we're not hearing it I'm convinced
[250.78 → 257.38] that if all we had were the gospel accounts Matthew or mark or Luke specifically Luke you cannot read
[257.38 → 263.12] through just the gospel account without realizing that Jesus gave so much of his time which was a
[263.12 → 269.42] precious commodity in his kingdom ministry he gave so much of that time to the poor to the outsiders
[269.42 → 276.68] to those that common society would avoid neglect not think about Jesus was there on the margins and so
[276.68 → 284.92] much of what he did was listen to them speak with them protect them break bread with them share his
[284.92 → 291.80] ministry in his life with them invite them into his life and forgive them invite them to be his followers
[291.80 → 298.66] to invite them to be his kingdom citizens this is Jesus ministry I mean Robert Paris who wrote a whole
[298.66 → 305.66] book on Jesus meals in the gospel he said Jesus got killed because of who he ate with he got killed because
[305.66 → 310.78] of who he ate with he ate with all the wrong people all the outsiders well all the insiders like the Pharisees
[310.78 → 316.52] said this guy's not safe this guy's dangerous because he was so willing to be at the margins and
[316.52 → 321.68] stay there and serve there and love the people there that he made the people in power uncomfortable
[321.68 → 329.86] I want to ask at the outset could the same be said of Jesus church today
[329.86 → 335.78] it is true that if you look through our church history there's a beautiful glorious tradition
[335.78 → 341.16] of the church being right on the front and centre of where the pain is where the hardship is where the
[341.16 → 346.38] vulnerable people live can that still be said of the church specifically in the west specifically in
[346.38 → 355.76] Canada maybe even our own city does hope community have the reputation of loving and serving our
[355.76 → 356.74] vulnerable neighbours
[356.74 → 364.82] Luke 7 is a masterful story in fact it's the kind of passage that you could preach multiple sermons on
[364.82 → 369.14] and we're going to walk through it slowly today but I want to just recognize that this story starts
[369.14 → 376.12] with Jesus being invited as a guest and then in comes another uninvited guests that the host of the
[376.12 → 381.08] meal does not welcome she is not welcome to this meal but Jesus welcomes her, and it creates this very
[381.08 → 386.44] tense awkward situation with the people who invited Jesus, but it forces some fascinating questions
[386.44 → 387.76] about hospitality like
[387.76 → 389.86] whose welcome in our tables
[389.86 → 394.64] who are the people we're okay being around with who are we not comfortable
[394.64 → 398.34] sharing meals with sharing life with breaking bread with
[398.34 → 402.08] Luke 7 sorts of forces some good hard questions on the church
[402.08 → 403.74] today about our hospitality
[403.74 → 409.18] but it starts with a Pharisee whose name we only learn later when Jesus speaks is Simon
[409.18 → 414.92] and in all likelihood Simon had power Simon was wealthy he probably had a bigger home that he can invite people in to have a meal with
[414.92 → 418.94] and it's in this meal with a reclining perhaps to learn about Jesus perhaps to
[418.94 → 423.54] see what they think about Jesus it's then that this uninvited guest comes
[423.54 → 428.74] this uninvited woman comes, and this woman isn't even given a name
[428.74 → 432.40] we know very little about her, she doesn't have a name what we do know is it said twice
[432.40 → 435.38] this is a woman who lives quote a sinful life
[435.38 → 439.84] and commentators are almost unanimous on this one where that sinful life is
[439.84 → 445.10] prostitution it's the sex trade it's that woman who does that thing for a living
[445.10 → 449.92] that woman who people might gossip about around the city about that area of her work and employment
[449.92 → 453.20] and she's the one who comes to see Jesus
[453.20 → 459.22] and it's striking because there's a lot of if I had more time I'd talk about these there are boundaries on hospitality
[459.22 → 467.24] in the early churches or sorry in the Jewish world than especially in the city the Pharisees would have a sense of whose welcome at the table who's not welcome at the table
[467.24 → 473.50] who are the people they can safely eat a meal with who are quote-unquote pure and who are the outsiders who are not welcome who are impure the gentiles
[473.50 → 480.66] and now it's in this scene at the home of a Pharisee a leader of the Jewish community this woman barges in
[480.66 → 488.68] and she's looking for Jesus, and she cares not one bit about all the rules that she's breaking hard and fast
[488.68 → 494.02] so that she can see Jesus she knows he's there she's learned his location, and she no longer cares
[494.02 → 498.90] that there's all these Pharisees these men of power in the Jewish community who are going to judge her hard
[498.90 → 502.74] even when I imagine her coming and standing behind Jesus
[502.74 → 506.60] I can imagine the blood pressure rising around this table
[506.60 → 509.76] I mean think about this just imagine for a moment this is your home
[509.76 → 514.58] and this woman shows up in your home she's standing behind a guest you invite it
[514.58 → 518.10] I can picture some of the men around the table just kind of
[518.10 → 522.34] this is awkward what are we going to do
[522.34 → 528.14] but Jesus doesn't do that Jesus doesn't even say like a nice polite statement of you know what this
[528.14 → 532.42] isn't the time this isn't the situation we want to be in he doesn't say anything in fact the person
[532.42 → 537.86] who breaks the moment who breaks the silence is Simon who says to himself and perhaps the people around
[537.86 → 544.50] the table if this man this prophet knew what was going on he'd know that this woman is a sinful
[544.50 → 552.10] woman that's touching him and kissing his feet, and you should know just how much she breaks the
[552.10 → 556.70] hospitality laws I mean her being there would have been tough enough for them, but she doesn't just do
[556.70 → 560.96] that I mean imagine this scene she's standing behind Jesus, and perhaps he's elevated and reclining his
[560.96 → 566.90] feet are beside him, she's weeping right her tears are falling on Jesus feet
[566.90 → 574.80] and she's using her hair just picture this to wipe the tears off Jesus feet, and then she takes
[574.80 → 585.26] this expensive perfume and dumps it on his feet this was unbelievably offensive to the host I mean
[585.26 → 588.96] this is something they couldn't even tolerate or fathom happening it would be humiliating and
[588.96 → 595.50] embarrassing and unthinkable to Simon who invited Jesus into his home or as one commentator said her even
[595.50 → 599.68] having her hair down would be the equivalent of someone coming into your home and undressing
[599.68 → 605.52] that's how much of an affront this whole scene is but Jesus doesn't seem to be uncomfortable
[605.52 → 611.50] it's Simon who expresses his discomfort, and we hear so much like this woman is a sinner he would
[611.50 → 617.92] know this if he were a prophet clearly Simon's expressing his frustration but then Jesus sort of
[617.92 → 621.70] turns this whole conversation to a strange direction where he didn't tell a mini parable
[621.70 → 626.04] a very small parable, and he says Simon let me tell you a story about a moneylender
[626.04 → 630.60] he lends money to these two people a lot to one person a little bit less to the other and he
[630.60 → 634.46] cancels the debt of both people who's going to be more grateful who's going to love the money
[634.46 → 639.82] lender more and Simon says well it seems rhetorical the person who is given forgiven more of their debt
[639.82 → 646.94] is going to be more grateful, and he says exactly the punch of that story is this woman is that person
[646.94 → 654.40] this woman has received the forgiveness and this scene some people by the way have said this scene
[654.40 → 657.68] is the woman sort of luring Jesus and these activities are sort of her trying to get his
[657.68 → 663.06] attention in unhealthy ways I disagree entirely and I agree with the writers who say this woman has
[663.06 → 667.70] actually met Jesus before and this does this happen other times in Luke where Jesus will encounter
[667.70 → 673.04] people speak to people who minister to people, and they then show up later in his ministry to speak
[673.04 → 677.26] with him to thank him to offer the gratitude to him and that's what's happening in this story
[677.26 → 684.24] this woman in the only profound way she knows how to offer a lavish extravagant act of gratitude
[684.24 → 687.96] for lavish extravagant grace
[687.96 → 697.62] and the irony of this story is she sees Jesus for who he is for what he has done Simon
[697.62 → 705.80] does not see Jesus for who he is and what he is doing and Jesus in fact gives a lot of his attention
[705.80 → 710.96] not to this woman but to Simon who doesn't understand what's going on before him and I want
[710.96 → 717.04] us to pay attention to what I think is probably my favourite verse in this passage where um Jesus has
[717.04 → 722.32] this woman at his feet and I can imagine this being a very uncomfortable situation and as she's with at
[722.32 → 731.42] his feet he looks at her but speaks to Simon, and he's asked Simon do you see this woman
[731.42 → 738.12] and he asked that question because he doesn't he doesn't see this woman he doesn't understand what's
[738.12 → 744.16] going on he doesn't see Jesus and Jesus wants to open his eyes he wants Simon to see the world in a
[744.16 → 748.60] different lens, and you need to know that Simon like so many people then he lived with a very clear sense
[748.60 → 756.06] of this is the holy Jewish community set apart in the city to be god's people, and we are boundaries
[756.06 → 762.26] off in our practices the way of life from the secular society the gentile way of life those people out
[762.26 → 766.84] there is the holy and there is the unholy the pure and the impure the insiders and the outsiders
[766.84 → 771.58] and Jesus is just shattering his paradigms here right think about who's coming into the meal
[771.58 → 777.32] think about who he's extending forgiveness to, and he's helping Simon see that god's kingdom the one that
[777.32 → 784.94] he's bringing in is the upside down kingdom he's just shattering all of Simon's inside outside paradigm
[784.94 → 792.12] he's saying this woman is welcome in my kingdom my grace extends to all these places all the vulnerable
[792.12 → 800.52] quote-unquote outsiders I welcome and invite to be my disciples because in Jesus kingdom no one is too far
[800.52 → 807.40] gone no one is too weak too poor too vulnerable too far gone and whatever they're caught up in
[807.40 → 815.74] for his grace and Simon needs to see it he needs to understand it he needs to see that the Jesus who's
[815.74 → 821.82] before him is god's son the fullest revelation of the father's heart and the fullest revelation of
[821.82 → 828.62] father's heart says to this woman in this area of life who's at this meal you are forgiven
[828.62 → 834.30] and Simon needs to learn from her how to see Jesus
[834.30 → 842.14] Tim Chester who wrote a book on hospitality in the Gospel of Luke who also says that you know Jesus main
[842.14 → 848.52] ministry is eating and drinking and in the Gospel of Luke he's just going from house to house eating here
[848.52 → 853.04] drinking there talking dining there he's just eating and drinking, and he talks about all
[853.04 → 857.84] these practices of hospitality and how it's working with the Pharisees and this is what he says about
[857.84 → 863.88] the Pharisees particularly the teachers of the law created a system that allowed them to feel superior
[863.88 → 870.66] and then lifted not one finger to help others then he invites us think of how this might play out today
[870.66 → 876.32] today's Pharisees might condemn the poor for their dysfunctional families but lift not one finger to help
[876.32 → 881.16] today's Pharisees might condemn the poor for their excessive drinking but lift not one finger to ease
[881.16 → 886.76] their pain today's Pharisees might condemn the poor for their laziness but lift not one finger to provide
[886.76 → 892.98] employment today's Pharisees might condemn the poor for their abortions but lift not one finger to adopt
[892.98 → 901.06] unwanted children we can't condemn these things at a distance that is legalism we must come alongside
[901.06 → 906.70] proclaiming and demonstrating the transforming grace of god
[906.70 → 915.64] to follow Jesus to serve like Jesus to wash the feet of the world like Jesus is to follow him into
[915.64 → 923.08] all these places brokenness and messiness and vulnerability and weakness and be comfortable
[923.08 → 927.62] there I'm struck by how there's so much discomfort in this story the more I read I just think man these
[927.62 → 931.28] Pharisees must have been just so triggered by everything that's happening but Jesus lived so
[931.28 → 936.80] well in that space he was not uncomfortable in fact as Chester goes on to say he says Jesus is
[936.80 → 942.64] remembered and criticized for being a friend of the sinners a friend of the outsiders the one who
[942.64 → 947.44] welcomes the tax collectors the one who invites to faith the Roman centurion in just a few chapters
[947.44 → 953.34] prior, and he's the one who sits and extends forgiveness to this woman he writes he's a friend of
[953.34 → 958.30] sinners he's not embarrassed by them, he's a friend of the riffraff the traitors the drunks the druggies
[958.30 → 964.02] the prostitutes the mentally ill the broken and the needy that's his posture and let me ask again
[964.02 → 972.48] is that what we're known for is that our posture is that the reputation hope community church has in our
[972.48 → 972.82] city
[972.82 → 981.70] Christine pole who's a professor at Asbury seminary she wrote a fair bit on hospitality as well and
[981.70 → 986.76] some of her work is just amazing and this is just a quote I pulled out of her book that relates very
[986.76 → 992.76] deeply to what we're talking about she often writes we maintain significant boundaries which is precisely
[992.76 → 998.32] what the Pharisees were doing when offering help to persons in need many churches prepare and serve
[998.32 → 1004.00] meals to hungry neighbours, but few church members find it easy to sit and eat with those who need the
[1004.00 → 1009.70] meal when there are people who are very different from ourselves we often find it more comfortable to
[1009.70 → 1015.64] cook and clean for them than share in a meal and a conversation we're familiar with the roles as
[1015.64 → 1023.60] helpers but are less certain about being equals together eating many of us struggle with
[1023.60 → 1032.34] simply being present with people in need I really like that quote I find it very convicting personally
[1032.34 → 1038.10] because Jesus was not just interested in charity this passage is not about hey if you just give to this
[1038.10 → 1042.22] cause and help these people over there and you kind of say at arm's length that's what we're after
[1042.22 → 1046.68] and that's not what we're after, and yes generosity is really important giving to causes is really
[1046.68 → 1052.26] important but Jesus sort of gets close I mean in the whole Gospel of Luke Jesus constantly getting
[1052.26 → 1058.00] close to the weak the poor the disadvantaged the marginalized he touches the lepers he doesn't have to
[1058.00 → 1062.98] do that he touches them he breaks bread with them, he's with this woman and this woman is close to him
[1062.98 → 1070.58] the ministry of Jesus is one of getting close moving from charity to kinship from being just helping out
[1070.58 → 1077.76] here and there to being with and for I think the church has so much to learn from Jesus ministry on
[1077.76 → 1082.20] being close and sharing life with our vulnerable neighbours
[1082.20 → 1089.06] one of the things I've loved about the Coverdale community kitchen I know many of us serve there
[1089.06 → 1093.54] throughout the week at least pre-covid we were allowed to do this where you know people would
[1093.54 → 1097.90] make good meals one of the things I love about the CCK is they don't just make sort of meals that are
[1097.90 → 1101.40] donated that are secondary meals you wouldn't feed your family, but they're good meals and I've always
[1101.40 → 1106.80] appreciated that, and then they share that meal with everybody who comes and I love how you know
[1106.80 → 1109.70] there's people in our church serving in the kitchen getting everything ready setting the tables
[1109.70 → 1114.76] then all the guests come, and we sit around those tables and then I find around the meal what happens is
[1114.76 → 1120.54] you're not just like giving this meal you're asking about each other's names you're learning
[1120.54 → 1124.58] each other's stories and I find so often you look around the room as people are sharing the meal
[1124.58 → 1129.62] there's prayer happening and there's that sense of now we're with each other now we're in relationship
[1129.62 → 1136.22] with one another we're getting close to one another in the way of Christ that is the ministry of Jesus
[1136.22 → 1145.32] now it needs to be emphasized that not everyone is called to the same kind of ministry or the same
[1145.32 → 1150.40] areas of vulnerable pain right there are people in our church and people in the past in our church
[1150.40 → 1155.26] even who've gotten involved in street ministry and involved with the lives of people in the sex trade
[1155.26 → 1159.86] in fact just last week I got to know about a ministry called servants anonymous and there's someone
[1159.86 → 1163.42] who's connected to our community is doing perfect work and just I'm learning a lot from him about
[1163.42 → 1169.30] how we serve in those ways and how churches can participate, but there's a whole host of ways that
[1169.30 → 1175.78] god gives us opportunity, and he gives us a desire to serve in fact in surge we talk about this we
[1175.78 → 1179.62] often ask the question of where's the burden that god's placed in your heart who are the people where
[1179.62 → 1184.42] you're like oh god I have to do something here this is just such a deep burden to my life this is
[1184.42 → 1190.18] an area of brokenness that I want to walk into and be a servant within and in our church you know I'm
[1190.18 → 1194.04] encouraged to see over the years okay these are the burdens that people have this is how they're
[1194.04 → 1199.68] acting on them, it encourages me you know I think of those who on a weekly basis they're visiting
[1199.68 → 1206.18] vulnerable seniors who are isolated who don't have family in town going out for meals being present to
[1206.18 → 1212.54] them I think of those in our church who spend time with those who are in prison on the phone week after
[1212.54 → 1218.62] week writing letters otherwise and being present and helping in any way behind the scenes for that person
[1218.62 → 1223.92] who is in a tough space in a tough place think of those who are involved in recovery ministry and i
[1223.92 → 1229.94] know that even on Wednesday nights we have our AA here in the fireside room think of those who open
[1229.94 → 1236.02] their homes so generously to international students to foster children who need a family for a season
[1236.02 → 1240.86] while their parents get healthy think of those who are involved in our refugee sponsorship saying hey
[1240.86 → 1246.60] this is a way I can help I can do all this hard administrative work so a family fleeing war and disaster
[1246.60 → 1251.12] can set up home in safety and get to know our community
[1251.12 → 1255.74] I think of those of you who serve very quietly behind the scenes
[1255.74 → 1261.32] people children and adults with disabilities and try to give a break to people who are going through a
[1261.32 → 1264.20] tough time with their family members who are really struggling in this season
[1264.20 → 1270.88] these are just a few ways and there are so many more whether it's with family or friends at school I mean
[1270.88 → 1275.20] some of my favourite stories are always students in the hallway or students in the classroom who see
[1275.20 → 1280.80] the need they see that other student their age or younger, and they say that's someone I can befriend
[1280.80 → 1287.06] that's someone I can share meals with that's someone I can bring into my life so they can experience a
[1287.06 → 1289.40] love of Jesus in ordinary hospitality
[1289.40 → 1298.60] three years ago Britney and I hosted a family from phoenix they knew Britney's parents and they
[1298.60 → 1302.08] wanted to see this beautiful place called British Columbia from the desert of phoenix to this
[1302.08 → 1305.22] you know garden of Eden didn't rain when they visited which is wonderful
[1305.22 → 1308.98] but they stayed with us while they did their travels around here, and we got to know them fairly
[1308.98 → 1312.22] well over the week it was the kind of thing where they came as strangers, and they left as friends
[1312.22 → 1317.22] but as we got to know them they shared their stories neither of them grew up in the church one of them grew up in a very
[1317.22 → 1323.02] broken home and had such strange difficult stuff going on with his dad but what stood to both Britney
[1323.02 → 1328.92] and me is how this couple and their family they had two kids had such a wide bandwidth for brokenness
[1328.92 → 1333.00] and they could invite anybody into their home at any time like doesn't matter what you're going through
[1333.00 → 1335.78] you're going through divorce you can stay with them your kids are going through trouble your kids can
[1335.78 → 1339.94] stay with them like didn't matter people in the city they seem to just find their way into their little
[1339.94 → 1345.06] home, and they just adjust make space find a bedroom and people could be there and I thought man that home
[1345.06 → 1351.28] is just a place of ministry, but one story in particular that really stood out to me is right before they visited us
[1351.28 → 1355.50] they said bye to a student middle eastern student who had stayed with them for a year while he was studying
[1355.50 → 1359.56] and it's through an organization cannot remember the name of the organization, but they told me the story of how
[1359.56 → 1364.54] the organization was calling so many families trying to find a house for this guy to stay in
[1364.54 → 1370.34] he's just there for a year and family after family said no and finally this they got a hold of this couple
[1370.34 → 1372.60] they said yeah absolutely he can stay with us, he can stay with us for free
[1372.60 → 1378.30] and the lady on the other end of the phone she said thank you so much it's been so hard for us to
[1378.30 → 1384.66] find a home in your city for someone from the Middle East and that's when they were like oh
[1384.66 → 1392.34] this is what Christians do this is how we operate this is like different from the way so many people
[1392.34 → 1398.10] think that you know they might see them as a threat we see them as guests and let me just ask the
[1398.10 → 1405.02] question who are those people who are the vulnerable in your life in your circles in your workplace in
[1405.02 → 1413.78] your classroom that you're feeling nudged by the spirit of god to wash the feet of to love to share
[1413.78 → 1421.94] life with to care for to open your home to I invite that question to go into your small groups I invite
[1421.94 → 1428.24] that question to go to your table as you break bread this afternoon this evening where do you feel
[1428.24 → 1433.06] god saying this is where I want you to serve this is where your burdens meet the real needs of the city
[1433.06 → 1437.04] and this is how you can wash the feet of your vulnerable neighbours
[1437.04 → 1451.34] Jesus wants Simon's eyes to be open so much of Jesus's attention is focused on Simon because he
[1451.34 → 1456.62] wants Simon to learn from this woman who he is he wants Simon to see himself and Jesus knows that if
[1456.62 → 1462.46] Simon sees him Jesus for who he is it's going to transform his relationship with that woman it's
[1462.46 → 1468.18] going to transform the way he loves her cares for sees her place in god's kingdom but Simon's
[1468.18 → 1476.50] heart first needs to be melted by the grace of Christ he needs to see the breadth of Jesus love his
[1476.50 → 1482.98] concern for the whole of his world and the people who are deeply vulnerable and in great need, and he's
[1482.98 → 1492.78] to know Simon needs to know that Jesus pulls them into his family and extends radical grace and love
[1492.78 → 1499.74] you know this story leaves me wondering at least for some reason I was wondering this week what was
[1499.74 → 1504.50] it is like for Simon after this meal you know I'm sure it's the kind of meal that never was forgotten in
[1504.50 → 1509.56] his household those Pharisees did not forget that time they shared a meal with Jesus and this woman came
[1509.56 → 1513.44] and Jesus started telling a parable, and then he forgave her, and they got all frustrated because
[1513.44 → 1517.72] Jesus is doing this like hosting now when he was the guest, and he's doing things that only god does
[1517.72 → 1523.86] I wonder if Simon kept tabs on Jesus watching Jesus do his ministry and trying to figure out what this
[1523.86 → 1527.18] kingdom is about why he's going to all these vulnerable people why he's inviting all the outsiders
[1527.18 → 1532.62] to be family with him what is this Jesus on about and I wonder if word got back to Simon
[1532.62 → 1539.40] what Jesus said in his very final breaths before he was crucified with that mocking statement that
[1539.40 → 1545.08] he was the king of the Jews I wonder if Simon heard that what Jesus said in his dying breaths was
[1545.08 → 1553.70] father forgive for they do not know what they are doing and if he heard that I wonder if it brought
[1553.70 → 1560.86] him back to the mini parable of this moneylender who gives this money to these people, and they can't
[1560.86 → 1565.98] pay it back, and he just cancels all of it he forgives it all and I wonder if there's ever that moment
[1565.98 → 1575.74] where Simon realized that's Christ for his world bringing on himself all their sin all their mess
[1575.74 → 1580.86] all their brokenness all the ways they've been sinned against and taking all of that sin to the grave
[1580.86 → 1585.44] and rising victorious to start a whole new kingdom movement
[1585.44 → 1591.44] where all the grace of Jesus is extended to all the people on the earth
[1591.44 → 1601.76] I hope Simon saw it, but you know as I preach this morning I want to know do we see it we are those
[1601.76 → 1606.08] who have had to some degree our eyes open we have responded in some way to Jesus but do we see
[1606.08 → 1612.18] this side of Jesus who takes the normal conventional structures of society says nope the upside down
[1612.18 → 1617.24] kingdom pulls in the weak it pulls in the vulnerable pulls in the poor it pulls in this woman
[1617.24 → 1625.36] who had no place around the table would she have a place around our table in our church
[1625.36 → 1633.68] in our family do we extend the hospitality of Jesus because I tell you what if that becomes who we are
[1633.68 → 1639.16] we join the millions of Christians throughout the world who realize that the way of Christ pushes us
[1639.16 → 1643.54] to the margins it pushes us to the weak I mean you could read any church history book and what you'll
[1643.54 → 1647.80] find is it's the Christians who start the hospitals it's the Christians who go to the bombing zones
[1647.80 → 1652.44] where there's the war it's the Christians who find the weakest most vulnerable most marginalized people
[1652.44 → 1658.90] say that's where the ministry is for us because we are followers of the Jesus who welcomes the vulnerable
[1658.90 → 1665.66] and I'm convinced that when people see the church being the followers of Jesus in this way
[1665.66 → 1670.32] it's good news for the city it's good news for the city
[1670.32 → 1673.96] let's pray together
[1673.96 → 1680.22] father we pray that you would help us see you
[1680.22 → 1684.46] and that we would see Jesus for who he is
[1684.46 → 1691.58] we pray that we would understand what this story means for us as a church
[1691.58 → 1696.68] and that you would break our hearts for our city
[1696.68 → 1700.16] and for those in our city who are on the outside
[1700.16 → 1701.80] who are not seen
[1701.80 → 1703.36] who are not loved
[1703.36 → 1704.54] who are not cared for
[1704.54 → 1706.52] who are not brought in
[1706.52 → 1710.62] I pray that we would be the church that lives
[1710.62 → 1712.46] the hospitality of Jesus
[1712.46 → 1714.94] in our words and in our deeds
[1714.94 → 1718.32] and I pray that you would fill us with your spirit
[1718.32 → 1720.00] to be courageously hospitable
[1720.00 → 1724.60] to be those who live the grace that we see in this passage
[1724.60 → 1728.22] and show the world the way of the upside down kingdom
[1728.22 → 1731.02] walk with us
[1731.02 → 1733.62] and enable us to be that church
[1733.62 → 1736.30] for the name of Christ amen
[1736.30 → 1749.84] also
[1749.84 → 1749.98] you
[1749.98 → 1750.06] and
[1750.06 → 1750.48] still
[1750.48 → 1750.52] um
[1750.52 → 1751.06] uh
[1751.06 → 1755.30] you
[1755.30 → 1755.42] you
