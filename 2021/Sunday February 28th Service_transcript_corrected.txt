[0.00 → 13.92] Good morning, people of hope, around the city, around the province, perhaps around the world.
[14.30 → 17.90] We welcome you here to our service of worship this morning.
[18.58 → 24.58] We are going to start with announcements and then move into the rest of the service.
[24.94 → 28.78] So the first announcement is thanked you very much for those who've already filled out the survey.
[28.78 → 34.08] I really appreciate it. It's good to hear from you, so many of you. It makes me feel connected again.
[35.06 → 38.16] So thank you for your creative ideas and just expressing how you're doing.
[38.58 → 40.96] There's still time to fill that out, so please do.
[41.06 → 45.88] If you haven't gotten an email that talks about that, let the office know and we'll make sure that happens.
[47.12 → 49.34] The next announcement is on a video.
[52.96 → 57.82] Hey everyone, we want to let you know about a new initiative that we're launching for local churches in our area.
[57.82 → 64.58] We know a number of local restaurants have been struggling with the dining restrictions, especially some of the smaller or newer places.
[65.06 → 68.00] We want to take this month to bless them in a simple and tangible way.
[68.54 → 69.94] Here's what we want to do together.
[70.40 → 73.18] First, we want you to buy food from local restaurants.
[73.56 → 78.00] Eating in would be ideal. That way you have a chance to get to know the servers, the chefs, and share your gratitude.
[78.48 → 80.42] But if takeout is possible, that's also great.
[80.42 → 83.72] Second, we want to encourage you to tip generously.
[84.10 → 88.56] Third, we want you to go online and give the restaurant an outstanding review.
[88.88 → 93.66] Fourth, if you're able to, we want you to take a photo of yourselves enjoying this meal and then post it on social media.
[93.84 → 99.18] And you can use the hashtag Dine Local BC as a way of encouraging other churches and other people to join this initiative.
[99.54 → 102.12] Lastly, we see this as a win-win-win.
[102.12 → 105.40] We get to enjoy a whole host of good food from around our city.
[105.72 → 108.48] We get to support local business owners, chefs, and servers.
[108.80 → 112.66] And the church can come together to bless our neighbourhood and our economy.
[112.66 → 120.60] It is good to be with you today.
[120.82 → 125.12] I have a couple of youth announcements that are kind of important, but also just good to know.
[125.54 → 129.54] Reminder, this week, Monday and Tuesday, we have youth group meetings in person.
[129.94 → 133.08] Reminder to wear your mask as we are trying to keep everyone safe.
[133.60 → 141.66] About Tuesday, our senior youth leaders have decided to graciously allow 15 extra minutes for discussion time in small groups.
[141.66 → 146.94] So parents, be mindful if you are picking up the latest 9 p.m. so that we can get home ourselves.
[147.68 → 156.98] Second, as more information comes out about our spring break plans, I just want you to be mindful that there is going to be a sign-up required for each day and each event.
[157.54 → 161.20] So just be mindful as news comes out about that you are going to have to register.
[161.52 → 164.92] So if you're going to bring a friend, make sure that you let them know so they can sign up too.
[165.64 → 167.48] And lastly, this is something brand new.
[167.48 → 181.54] As I'm not able to get to meet so many of you parents specifically in person, I have decided to offer once a week, every Thursday from 12 to 1 p.m., hopefully over your lunch hour if you're working, an office hour virtually on Zoom.
[181.76 → 186.08] So I sent out a link in the weekly emails you get, also to your parent emails.
[186.08 → 192.38] But I will re-share that link on Wednesday in the Facebook group so that you can join on Thursdays if you would like to.
[192.72 → 195.80] It's going to happen probably for the next month at least to see how it goes.
[196.20 → 199.90] And yeah, I look forward to getting to connect with you either about life or youth.
[200.34 → 201.26] And yeah, see you later.
[204.54 → 205.42] Thank you, Misha.
[205.42 → 218.52] I'm going to start with reading through, praying through portions of Psalm 51 as we focus this week on the Holy Spirit.
[219.10 → 221.12] So will you join me in prayer?
[224.12 → 227.44] Holy God, have mercy on us.
[227.88 → 232.08] According to your unfailing love and according to your great compassion,
[232.08 → 262.06] God bless you, Misha.
[262.84 → 263.84] Sustain us.
[264.98 → 269.56] Holy Spirit, we invite you here into our homes,
[270.02 → 277.32] whether we've arrived to this service after a bunch of kid chaos or just a cup of coffee,
[277.66 → 280.52] we've just struggled to get out of bed, whatever it is.
[280.58 → 284.14] God, I pray we set aside all of those distractions
[284.14 → 287.96] and whatever is possible in our family life, in our home right now,
[287.96 → 290.26] that you would fill us,
[290.86 → 293.50] that you would be present with us,
[293.50 → 298.40] that you would renew our spirits and our souls at this moment.
[298.40 → 301.96] God, we invite you here.
[301.96 → 307.30] We invite you in our community, wherever we happen to physically be.
[307.30 → 310.46] We thank you, Father.
[310.46 → 311.34] Amen.
[311.34 → 311.48] Amen.
[312.48 → 317.82] I wanted to just briefly read out of this tiny little book written,
[317.82 → 322.02] actually exactly 100 years ago, first published in 1921.
[322.02 → 325.50] This woman writes beautifully about prayer.
[326.78 → 333.64] And she is talking about saints, people that we would admire, saints in the faith.
[333.64 → 340.82] When we read the lives of the saints, we are struck by a certain large leisure,
[341.24 → 343.60] and that's not laziness, leisure,
[343.90 → 348.22] which went hand in hand with remarkable effectiveness.
[349.22 → 350.68] They were never hurried.
[350.68 → 354.26] They did comparatively few things,
[354.84 → 357.42] and these not necessarily striking or important.
[358.42 → 362.18] And they troubled very little about their own influence.
[363.00 → 365.58] Yet they always seemed to hit the mark.
[366.46 → 369.18] Every bit of their life told.
[370.36 → 372.70] Their simplest action had a distinction,
[373.78 → 377.72] an exquisiteness, which suggested the artist.
[377.72 → 383.34] I thought that was a beautiful way to describe what the Holy Spirit can do in our lives.
[384.20 → 386.86] That our actions, our behaviours, our attitudes,
[387.12 → 393.16] how we interact in the world can reflect the artist, the creator, our God.
[394.36 → 397.80] So as part of the community, as part of caring for one another,
[398.20 → 400.48] please take this time to text someone,
[400.84 → 404.06] or throughout the week as well, of course,
[404.06 → 408.10] reach out to people who perhaps are struggling at this moment,
[408.22 → 410.00] perhaps someone you haven't spoken to before.
[410.46 → 411.26] Flip through the directory.
[411.64 → 412.32] Text someone.
[412.72 → 413.46] Let them know you care.
[413.46 → 413.52] Thank you.
[413.52 → 413.58] Thank you.
[434.06 → 464.04] Thank you.
[464.06 → 494.04] Thank you.
[494.06 → 504.06] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[504.06 → 507.98] Open the eyes of my heart.
[507.98 → 511.30] I want to see you.
[512.74 → 516.14] I want to see you.
[518.54 → 522.52] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[522.52 → 524.52] Open the eyes of my heart.
[524.52 → 526.90] Open the eyes of my heart.
[526.90 → 530.52] I want to see you.
[530.52 → 534.52] I want to see you.
[534.52 → 535.52] I want to see you.
[535.52 → 540.52] To see you high and lifted.
[540.56 → 541.48] That's who I want to see you in the eye.
[541.52 → 544.48] TT's an Anthony of Win.
[544.52 → 546.48] God bless
[546.54 → 547.48] light.
[548.68 → 548.90] You're one of my family.
[548.94 → 549.42] I love you, God.
[549.52 → 552.06] I love you that I love you.
[552.52 → 553.52] And I need you.
[553.52 → 555.68] Holy, holy
[555.68 → 563.72] Open the eyes of our hearts, Lord
[563.72 → 567.60] Open the eyes of our hearts
[567.60 → 571.44] We want to see you
[571.44 → 576.22] We want to see you
[576.22 → 578.22] Sing it as a community, as a church
[578.22 → 582.66] Open the eyes of our hearts, Lord
[582.66 → 587.16] Open the eyes of our hearts
[587.16 → 590.58] We want to see you
[590.58 → 595.74] We want to see you
[595.74 → 598.50] To see you
[598.50 → 601.48] I am living up
[601.48 → 606.66] Shining in the light of your glory
[606.66 → 610.66] Pour out your power and love
[610.66 → 616.22] As we sing holy, holy, holy
[616.22 → 617.58] To see you
[617.58 → 620.58] I am living up
[620.58 → 626.46] Shining in the light of your glory
[626.46 → 630.76] Pour out your power and love
[630.76 → 636.32] As we sing holy, holy, holy
[636.32 → 643.36] Holy, holy, holy
[643.36 → 648.26] Holy, holy, holy
[648.26 → 653.14] Holy, holy, holy
[653.14 → 656.76] We want to see you
[656.76 → 662.32] Holy, holy, holy
[662.32 → 664.32] Holy, holy, holy
[664.32 → 668.32] Holy, holy, holy
[668.32 → 673.32] Holy, holy, holy
[673.32 → 677.68] We want to see you
[677.68 → 683.24] Holy, holy, holy
[683.24 → 686.24] Holy, holy, holy
[686.24 → 688.18] Holy, holy, holy
[688.18 → 689.24] Holy, holy, holy
[689.24 → 693.20] Lord God almighty
[693.20 → 700.06] Early in the morning
[700.06 → 705.18] Our songs shall rise UNF Pooh
[705.18 → 709.38] Holy, holy, holy
[709.38 → 709.88] Holy, holy
[709.88 → 711.10] Holy, holy
[711.24 → 712.92] Holy, holy
[712.92 → 715.12] Holy, holy
[715.16 → 720.80] Holy, holy, holy
[720.80 → 727.80] God in three persons
[727.80 → 732.80] Blessed Trinity
[732.80 → 738.46] Will you bow your heads and pray with me?
[740.54 → 743.00] Holy Father, Almighty God,
[743.80 → 747.82] thank you for welcoming us into your presence with open arms.
[747.82 → 753.72] You know our sin and yet you are full of grace, abounding in love.
[755.70 → 760.24] Lord, as we lay our sins at the cross, we ask for mercy.
[762.58 → 768.94] For thinking of ourselves more than others, more than you, Lord, have mercy.
[770.48 → 774.94] For lacking compassion, Lord, have mercy.
[774.94 → 781.74] For failing to speak words of love, Lord, have mercy.
[783.28 → 788.92] For ignoring the cries of the oppressed, Lord, have mercy.
[790.40 → 796.20] For trying to live on our own strength, Lord, have mercy.
[796.20 → 801.44] For placing our hopes in things that will never satisfy.
[802.68 → 804.30] Lord, have mercy.
[806.68 → 811.12] In your mercy, open our hearts to welcome your spirit.
[811.96 → 815.88] To welcome the changes that you want to make in us as a church,
[816.64 → 819.62] as families, as children of God.
[819.62 → 822.92] Lord, and we thank you for your presence with us.
[827.00 → 827.48] Amen.
[827.48 → 827.58] Amen.
[827.58 → 857.56] Thank you.
[857.58 → 863.80] There's nothing worth more that will ever come close.
[864.56 → 866.88] Nothing can compare.
[867.80 → 871.46] You're our living hope.
[873.76 → 877.78] Your presence, Lord.
[877.78 → 889.24] I've tasted and seen of the sweetest of loves.
[889.24 → 897.24] Where my heart becomes free, and my shame is alive.
[898.26 → 902.24] In your presence, Lord.
[902.24 → 912.24] Holy Spirit, you are welcome here.
[912.24 → 918.24] Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere.
[918.24 → 925.38] Your glory, God, is what our hearts long for.
[925.72 → 932.94] To be overcome by your presence, Lord.
[932.94 → 940.94] Your presence, Lord.
[945.94 → 951.94] There's nothing worth more that will ever come close.
[951.94 → 954.94] Nothing can compare.
[956.32 → 959.94] You're our living hope.
[961.94 → 965.94] Your presence, Lord.
[965.94 → 977.40] I've tasted and seen of the sweetest of loves.
[977.40 → 983.94] When my heart becomes clean and my shame is unknown.
[983.94 → 990.94] In your presence, Lord.
[994.94 → 999.94] Holy Spirit, you are welcome.
[999.94 → 1005.94] Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere.
[1005.94 → 1007.94] Your glory, God.
[1007.94 → 1012.94] Your glory, God, is what our hearts long for.
[1012.94 → 1019.94] We overcome by your presence, Lord.
[1019.94 → 1024.94] Holy Spirit, you are welcome.
[1024.94 → 1029.30] Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere.
[1029.30 → 1034.68] Your glory, God, is what our hearts long for.
[1034.94 → 1036.30] order, visit and see it again.
[1036.38 → 1040.30] By your presence, Lord.
[1040.64 → 1042.80] Please check your presence, Lord.
[1042.80 → 1045.96] Your presence, Lord.
[1046.46 → 1050.30] waking up with His love.
[1050.30 → 1052.54] Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere.
[1052.54 → 1054.22] Your glory, God, is what our hearts long for.
[1054.22 → 1054.60] Champion.
[1054.60 → 1064.44] Let us become more aware of your presence
[1064.44 → 1071.22] Let us experience the glory of your goodness
[1071.22 → 1077.90] Let us become more aware of your presence
[1077.90 → 1084.58] Let us experience the glory of your goodness
[1084.58 → 1090.92] Let us become more aware of your presence
[1090.92 → 1097.36] Let us experience the glory of your goodness
[1097.36 → 1110.16] Holy Spirit, you are welcome here
[1110.16 → 1116.50] Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere
[1116.50 → 1123.84] Your glory, God, is what our hearts long for
[1123.84 → 1132.18] To be overcome by your presence, Lord
[1132.18 → 1145.10] Good morning, church.
[1145.82 → 1149.90] It's my honour and privilege to pray with you this morning.
[1150.12 → 1150.86] Will you join me?
[1150.86 → 1156.74] Father God, we come before you this morning in this season of Lent
[1156.74 → 1158.96] A season of reflection
[1158.96 → 1163.98] A season where we admit and can admit openly
[1163.98 → 1167.66] That we are a broken people in need of a Saviour
[1167.66 → 1170.34] And so, Lord, we thank you
[1170.34 → 1173.42] We thank you for all that you have done
[1173.42 → 1175.70] Your patience with us
[1175.70 → 1176.58] Your mercy
[1176.58 → 1179.90] And in that mercy, you continue to lead
[1179.90 → 1183.02] And guide us back to where we desperately need to be
[1183.02 → 1185.58] At your feet in worship
[1185.58 → 1188.88] We thank you, Lord, for who you are
[1188.88 → 1192.04] A God who has never broken covenant with us
[1192.04 → 1195.92] And continues to do the work that you began in our hearts
[1195.92 → 1196.92] And will complete
[1196.92 → 1201.36] We praise and glorify you, our Saviour and our Redeemer
[1201.36 → 1206.26] Father, we join together to pray for those in our congregation this morning
[1206.26 → 1208.08] Those we know who are hurting
[1208.08 → 1211.50] There are those who have chronic illnesses
[1211.50 → 1216.22] And with the pandemic, support for them has been so limited
[1216.22 → 1221.56] We pray, Lord, that you strengthen all those who are feeling so isolated and lonely
[1221.56 → 1224.68] We pray for families with young children
[1224.68 → 1229.90] This is usually the times when kids can freely play together without fear of illness
[1229.90 → 1233.10] And now children are missing out on social connections
[1233.10 → 1237.82] Give these parents patience and wisdom as they guide their children
[1237.82 → 1242.88] We pray for our seniors who have also been isolated and feel disconnected
[1242.88 → 1247.18] We pray that the vaccines can be administered in a timely way
[1247.18 → 1250.80] So that life and connecting with others can begin again
[1250.80 → 1254.04] In the meantime, though, Lord, we pray
[1254.04 → 1257.24] That we also make wise use of this time
[1257.24 → 1259.14] And not focus on the negative
[1259.14 → 1262.58] As we start to see signs of spring coming
[1262.58 → 1266.12] Let it also remind us that this too will pass
[1266.12 → 1269.82] And at this moment, we have the opportunity
[1269.82 → 1273.18] To not be as distracted with busyness
[1273.18 → 1276.72] But help us to reach out to others in different ways
[1276.72 → 1279.52] Lord, we pray for your church
[1279.52 → 1282.96] Here at Hope and also in our communities
[1282.96 → 1285.06] Strengthen with your wisdom
[1285.06 → 1288.58] Unite us as people who are one in you
[1288.58 → 1291.22] For you are our centre
[1291.22 → 1295.64] We pray for our persecuted brothers and sisters around the world
[1295.64 → 1299.28] Who risked their lives to spread the good news of Jesus Christ
[1299.28 → 1303.06] And Father, help us to remember what you said in your word
[1303.06 → 1304.36] Through the prophet Isaiah
[1304.36 → 1308.12] Even to your old age and gray hairs
[1308.12 → 1309.80] I am he
[1309.80 → 1312.72] I am he who will sustain you
[1312.72 → 1314.66] I have made you
[1314.66 → 1316.32] And I will carry you
[1316.32 → 1318.32] I will sustain you
[1318.32 → 1320.54] And I will rescue you
[1320.54 → 1323.58] May all glory be given to our great God
[1323.58 → 1327.18] In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
[1327.18 → 1328.14] Amen
[1328.14 → 1345.60] My brother-in-law once told me a story
[1345.60 → 1347.34] Of when he was in seminary
[1347.34 → 1349.54] He and his friends would sit at the back of a sanctuary
[1349.54 → 1351.42] And they'd play this game where
[1351.42 → 1352.98] One of them would read a passage
[1352.98 → 1355.64] And then pick another one of them
[1355.64 → 1357.18] Who would then walk up
[1357.18 → 1359.22] To stand at the pulpit
[1359.22 → 1361.26] And they only had the time of walking
[1361.26 → 1363.00] To prepare what they were going to say
[1363.00 → 1365.40] I remember thinking that's a nightmare
[1365.40 → 1368.56] And I feel like I'm living a little bit about that this morning
[1368.56 → 1370.78] I got a call yesterday from Pastor Sid
[1370.78 → 1372.48] Who said to me, he's not feeling well
[1372.48 → 1373.22] It's not COVID
[1373.22 → 1374.36] He's very dizzy
[1374.36 → 1375.68] And so he'd like me to preach
[1375.68 → 1377.26] And so here we are
[1377.26 → 1381.12] Usually we have what I would call slow cooker sermons
[1381.12 → 1382.56] Where we get to spend lots of time
[1382.56 → 1384.40] In word and meditation
[1384.40 → 1386.94] This morning you get a pressure cooker sermon
[1386.94 → 1388.74] And if this goes sideways
[1388.74 → 1390.56] You can just blame Pastor Sid
[1390.56 → 1392.86] We're going to continue our series
[1392.86 → 1394.02] On apprenticing with Jesus
[1394.02 → 1395.22] And this morning
[1395.22 → 1396.58] And actually for the next four weeks
[1396.58 → 1398.28] We're looking at the specific ways
[1398.28 → 1400.26] That we ground ourselves
[1400.26 → 1401.56] In the life of Christ
[1401.56 → 1403.86] And the work of the Holy Spirit
[1403.86 → 1406.36] Through specific habits and practices
[1406.36 → 1409.16] And I'm going to read a number of passages
[1409.16 → 1411.52] But they're going to come just in a few minutes
[1411.52 → 1412.50] In our sermon
[1412.50 → 1416.20] Let me begin by sharing a story
[1416.20 → 1417.36] About last summer
[1417.36 → 1418.62] Last summer Brittany and I
[1418.62 → 1419.68] Along with her family
[1419.68 → 1421.98] We went on vacation for a week
[1421.98 → 1422.88] In Summer land, BC
[1422.88 → 1423.88] There's a couple in our church
[1423.88 → 1424.80] We rented their cabin
[1424.80 → 1426.32] And it was an amazing week
[1426.32 → 1427.54] We spent a lot of time
[1427.54 → 1428.56] Playing with our kids
[1428.56 → 1429.46] Being in the water
[1429.46 → 1430.48] Playing on the beach
[1430.48 → 1432.08] But there was one thing
[1432.08 → 1432.96] That we as adults
[1432.96 → 1434.54] Really earmarked for us
[1434.54 → 1435.08] For that week
[1435.08 → 1435.50] And that was
[1435.50 → 1436.76] We heard in Mention
[1436.76 → 1438.48] There was this river float
[1438.48 → 1439.42] And it's
[1439.42 → 1440.78] If you've seen the brochure before
[1440.78 → 1441.54] It's a beautiful
[1441.54 → 1443.66] Seven kilometre lazy river
[1443.66 → 1444.58] Where you go in a tube
[1444.58 → 1446.26] And you just go down the river
[1446.26 → 1447.52] In this beautiful scene
[1447.52 → 1449.24] And we wanted to do that
[1449.24 → 1449.80] So one day
[1449.80 → 1451.22] We packed our lunches
[1451.22 → 1452.76] And we went down to Mention
[1452.76 → 1454.14] And the first thing we realized
[1454.14 → 1455.34] Was we were not the only family
[1455.34 → 1456.54] With this genius idea
[1456.54 → 1457.86] The place was packed
[1457.86 → 1458.86] And we were waiting
[1458.86 → 1459.98] In a very long lineup
[1459.98 → 1460.86] In the blazing heat
[1460.86 → 1461.76] To get our tubes
[1461.76 → 1462.30] And of course
[1462.30 → 1463.60] Our children all took turns
[1463.60 → 1464.56] Being miserable
[1464.56 → 1465.86] And complaining about the heat
[1465.86 → 1467.68] But of course
[1467.68 → 1468.70] Then we finally got to the river
[1468.70 → 1469.66] We had our tubes
[1469.66 → 1470.84] And we were so excited
[1470.84 → 1471.58] It was beautiful
[1471.58 → 1472.46] It was serene
[1472.46 → 1472.98] The scenery
[1472.98 → 1473.90] Everything was perfect
[1473.90 → 1474.56] And so we started
[1474.56 → 1475.36] Putting our children
[1475.36 → 1476.66] We had lots of kids there
[1476.66 → 1477.80] Put the tubes in the water
[1477.80 → 1478.84] Put our kids in the river
[1478.84 → 1479.96] And that's when things
[1479.96 → 1481.38] Really started to go sideways
[1481.38 → 1482.90] Some of our kids
[1482.90 → 1484.08] Caught the current pretty quickly
[1484.08 → 1485.30] And they went way ahead of us
[1485.30 → 1485.90] Other kids
[1485.90 → 1486.76] They went sideways
[1486.76 → 1487.50] And two of them
[1487.50 → 1488.54] Within like 30 seconds
[1488.54 → 1489.96] Got stuck in tree branches
[1489.96 → 1491.70] Hanging over the side of the river
[1491.70 → 1492.82] There were tears
[1492.82 → 1493.68] There was screaming
[1493.68 → 1495.22] There was separation from parents
[1495.22 → 1496.40] When the idea was to have
[1496.40 → 1498.16] Our tubes linked together safely
[1498.16 → 1499.88] And so the first 30 minutes
[1499.88 → 1500.70] Were like splashing
[1500.70 → 1502.00] Yelling instructions
[1502.00 → 1503.24] That nobody could hear
[1503.24 → 1504.68] And just parents scrambling
[1504.68 → 1505.50] To make it look like
[1505.50 → 1506.46] Our family is normal
[1506.46 → 1508.64] I was one of the family members
[1508.64 → 1509.18] The parents
[1509.18 → 1510.02] Who had children
[1510.02 → 1511.02] Way behind me
[1511.02 → 1512.88] And what I had attempted to do
[1512.88 → 1513.92] In this lazy river
[1513.92 → 1515.54] Was swim against the current
[1515.54 → 1516.82] To grab my child
[1516.82 → 1518.48] And to link my tube up with his
[1518.48 → 1519.90] That didn't work
[1519.90 → 1521.38] It was when I realized then
[1521.38 → 1522.94] How strong the current was
[1522.94 → 1524.08] As I paddled with my tube
[1524.08 → 1524.78] I was going nowhere
[1524.78 → 1526.04] And as I sank my body
[1526.04 → 1526.68] Into the water
[1526.68 → 1528.12] I realized just how much
[1528.12 → 1529.66] More powerful the current was
[1529.66 → 1530.78] Than the strength of my body
[1530.78 → 1531.30] To swim
[1531.30 → 1532.92] And all of us
[1532.92 → 1533.84] As we were scrambling
[1533.84 → 1534.84] To connect our tubes
[1534.84 → 1536.20] Realized that the force
[1536.20 → 1537.78] Of this lazy river
[1537.78 → 1539.74] Was stronger than we realized
[1539.74 → 1542.32] Now I share this story
[1542.32 → 1543.58] Because I think it gives us
[1543.58 → 1544.06] A picture
[1544.06 → 1546.36] Of often how it feels
[1546.36 → 1547.32] For us as apprentices
[1547.32 → 1547.88] Of Jesus
[1547.88 → 1550.12] To live out our faith
[1550.12 → 1550.68] In Christ
[1550.68 → 1551.98] And to follow him
[1551.98 → 1553.74] In the western story
[1553.74 → 1554.60] The western culture
[1554.60 → 1555.70] We find ourselves in
[1555.70 → 1557.76] It feels like this serene
[1557.76 → 1558.72] Lazy river
[1558.72 → 1559.80] That's all good
[1559.80 → 1560.96] And everything feels fine
[1560.96 → 1562.82] Until you try to stand
[1562.82 → 1564.12] Against the current
[1564.12 → 1565.76] Then you feel
[1565.76 → 1566.68] Its power
[1566.68 → 1568.74] I want to read for you
[1568.74 → 1569.48] An extended quote
[1569.48 → 1570.56] That comes from a pastor
[1570.56 → 1572.08] Named Jeremy Slim
[1572.08 → 1573.78] On living in the waters
[1573.78 → 1574.84] Of the western culture
[1574.84 → 1575.38] He writes
[1575.38 → 1578.02] There is a constant pulling
[1578.02 → 1580.04] An overwhelmingly powerful
[1580.04 → 1583.98] Nearly invisible current
[1583.98 → 1584.78] That undergirds
[1584.78 → 1586.06] Our entire way of life
[1586.06 → 1587.84] It shapes our collective values
[1587.84 → 1589.00] Our shared consciousness
[1589.00 → 1590.80] It defines for us
[1590.80 → 1592.04] That which we should value
[1592.04 → 1593.78] And that which we should discard
[1593.78 → 1595.02] It's here
[1595.02 → 1596.72] Riding on these particular waves
[1596.72 → 1598.08] In this particular culture
[1598.08 → 1599.38] That we find ourselves
[1599.38 → 1600.52] Shaped
[1600.52 → 1601.80] And being shaped
[1601.80 → 1603.16] And not until we attempt
[1603.16 → 1604.78] To plant our feet
[1604.78 → 1606.32] Do we feel the shocking
[1606.32 → 1607.52] Ferocity
[1607.52 → 1609.44] With which the stream
[1609.44 → 1610.28] Fights back
[1610.28 → 1611.78] The pressure builds
[1611.78 → 1613.32] Just to go with the flow
[1613.32 → 1614.52] You begin to hear
[1614.52 → 1616.02] The currents whisper to you
[1616.02 → 1617.50] Be a consumer
[1617.50 → 1619.80] Defend yourself
[1619.80 → 1621.56] Don't tread on me
[1621.56 → 1622.58] Fight for your rights
[1622.58 → 1624.14] You do you
[1624.14 → 1626.20] Standing in the middle
[1626.20 → 1627.34] Of this roaring river
[1627.34 → 1628.44] Desperately attempting
[1628.44 → 1629.50] To participate
[1629.50 → 1630.78] In the story described
[1630.78 → 1631.42] In the scriptures
[1631.42 → 1632.30] We wonder
[1632.30 → 1633.90] Why is it so hard
[1633.90 → 1635.66] To act like Jesus
[1635.66 → 1637.24] In the constant pressure
[1637.24 → 1640.24] Why is loving enemies
[1640.24 → 1641.66] Seem like such a fantasy
[1641.66 → 1642.84] In a current
[1642.84 → 1643.84] That says defeat
[1643.84 → 1645.42] Hospitality to the poor
[1645.42 → 1646.36] Seems impossible
[1646.36 → 1647.22] In the current
[1647.22 → 1648.20] That says consume
[1648.20 → 1649.64] Humility is rare
[1649.64 → 1650.20] In the current
[1650.20 → 1651.46] That encourages bluster
[1651.46 → 1652.84] Love that risks
[1652.84 → 1654.00] The safe and the rational
[1654.00 → 1655.28] Is unimaginable
[1655.28 → 1655.80] In the current
[1655.80 → 1657.60] That prizes security
[1657.60 → 1660.76] And I don't know
[1660.76 → 1661.38] How this quote
[1661.38 → 1662.24] Rests with you
[1662.24 → 1663.82] But I imagine
[1663.82 → 1664.66] That many of us
[1664.66 → 1665.56] In our own ways
[1665.56 → 1666.52] In our ordinary lives
[1666.52 → 1667.80] Have felt the power
[1667.80 → 1669.08] Of that current
[1669.08 → 1670.48] Perhaps it's that
[1670.48 → 1671.38] New year's resolution
[1671.38 → 1671.98] You made
[1671.98 → 1672.78] To read the scriptures
[1672.78 → 1673.54] More but somehow
[1673.54 → 1674.36] Three months later
[1674.36 → 1674.86] Or two and a half
[1674.86 → 1675.20] Months later
[1675.20 → 1676.26] You find yourself
[1676.26 → 1677.26] Swept back into
[1677.26 → 1678.10] The ordinary rhythms
[1678.10 → 1679.16] With no scripture
[1679.16 → 1679.82] In your life
[1679.82 → 1681.30] Or you want to
[1681.30 → 1682.22] Work these things
[1682.22 → 1682.84] Out in community
[1682.84 → 1684.18] And work out ways
[1684.18 → 1684.96] To follow Jesus
[1684.96 → 1685.50] Intentionally
[1685.50 → 1685.92] But you just
[1685.92 → 1686.84] Find yourself
[1686.84 → 1687.96] Floating along
[1687.96 → 1689.32] That powerful current
[1689.32 → 1690.88] Of western values
[1690.88 → 1691.96] Ideals
[1691.96 → 1694.14] But here's the thing
[1694.14 → 1696.40] Jesus when he lived
[1696.40 → 1697.32] In the first century
[1697.32 → 1698.74] Stood in a stream
[1698.74 → 1699.82] He lived in a world
[1699.82 → 1700.42] That had a very
[1700.42 → 1701.52] Powerful current
[1701.52 → 1701.98] Of its own
[1701.98 → 1702.68] Very different from
[1702.68 → 1703.26] The western world
[1703.26 → 1703.96] We live in now
[1703.96 → 1705.38] But it was a powerful story
[1705.38 → 1705.74] Nonetheless
[1705.74 → 1706.94] That swept people
[1706.94 → 1707.92] In a certain direction
[1707.92 → 1709.72] And was very forceful
[1709.72 → 1711.64] And yet he stood
[1711.64 → 1713.34] Facing the current
[1713.34 → 1714.42] Facing its power
[1714.42 → 1715.56] All the ways
[1715.56 → 1716.28] It shaped people
[1716.28 → 1717.42] And he swam
[1717.42 → 1718.40] In a different direction
[1718.40 → 1720.66] Not only that
[1720.66 → 1722.20] He invites apprentices
[1722.20 → 1723.08] And disciples
[1723.08 → 1723.90] And all who would
[1723.90 → 1724.64] Follow in his way
[1724.64 → 1726.12] To move in that
[1726.12 → 1726.90] Same direction
[1726.90 → 1728.46] Of the kingdom of God
[1728.46 → 1730.20] And this morning
[1730.20 → 1731.04] We want to ask
[1731.04 → 1732.64] How did he do that
[1732.64 → 1733.88] And what does it look like
[1733.88 → 1734.58] For his disciples
[1734.58 → 1735.50] To follow suit
[1735.50 → 1737.06] Now the easy answer
[1737.06 → 1737.52] When you ask
[1737.52 → 1738.20] How did Jesus
[1738.20 → 1739.66] Resist the cultural story
[1739.66 → 1740.48] How did he swim
[1740.48 → 1741.18] Against the current
[1741.18 → 1742.04] The easy answer
[1742.04 → 1742.78] Of course is
[1742.78 → 1744.00] Well he's God
[1744.00 → 1745.84] Jesus can do these things
[1745.84 → 1747.02] But it's not
[1747.02 → 1748.84] It's not only that
[1748.84 → 1750.20] It's also a different
[1750.20 → 1751.02] Part of his life
[1751.02 → 1753.26] Many people look at Jesus
[1753.26 → 1753.92] And they notice
[1753.92 → 1754.60] In his ministry
[1754.60 → 1755.24] And the gospels
[1755.24 → 1756.40] Put this on full display
[1756.40 → 1757.38] That Jesus had
[1757.38 → 1758.50] A unique way
[1758.50 → 1759.20] Of living
[1759.20 → 1760.36] He had distinct
[1760.36 → 1761.38] Habits and practices
[1761.38 → 1762.98] That he was committed to
[1762.98 → 1765.02] That led in a certain direction
[1765.02 → 1767.48] And apprentices
[1767.48 → 1768.02] Of Jesus
[1768.02 → 1768.78] Throughout history
[1768.78 → 1769.88] As they follow
[1769.88 → 1770.92] Those ways
[1770.92 → 1772.78] They tune their lives
[1772.78 → 1773.74] With this new stream
[1773.74 → 1774.24] Of the kingdom
[1774.24 → 1775.22] Of God
[1775.22 → 1779.54] Jesus himself
[1779.54 → 1780.74] Practiced things
[1780.74 → 1781.50] Not only
[1781.50 → 1782.58] Because he wanted to
[1782.58 → 1783.22] But perhaps
[1783.22 → 1784.18] As many writers said
[1784.18 → 1785.24] Because he also
[1785.24 → 1786.00] Needed to
[1786.00 → 1786.98] As he lived
[1786.98 → 1787.54] In fasting
[1787.54 → 1788.12] In prayer
[1788.12 → 1789.40] As he tuned himself
[1789.40 → 1790.04] Through practices
[1790.04 → 1790.64] With God
[1790.64 → 1791.64] He dwelt
[1791.64 → 1792.68] In the love of the Father
[1792.68 → 1794.16] He received the power
[1794.16 → 1794.64] Of the Spirit
[1794.64 → 1795.30] And he was able
[1795.30 → 1796.86] To do all that he did
[1796.86 → 1798.00] Minister
[1798.00 → 1799.18] And teach
[1799.18 → 1800.28] Preach
[1800.28 → 1801.22] Heal
[1801.22 → 1802.30] Cast out demons
[1802.30 → 1802.98] And embody
[1802.98 → 1803.46] And live
[1803.46 → 1804.22] The kingdom of God
[1804.22 → 1806.22] Through these practices
[1806.22 → 1807.98] Through which he gained
[1807.98 → 1809.12] And lived in
[1809.12 → 1810.10] The power of the Spirit
[1810.10 → 1812.86] The church
[1812.86 → 1813.42] Throughout history
[1813.42 → 1814.68] As they look at Jesus' life
[1814.68 → 1815.78] They see these
[1815.78 → 1816.68] Specific practices
[1816.68 → 1817.60] And over time
[1817.60 → 1818.98] They've often been described
[1818.98 → 1820.42] As spiritual disciplines
[1820.42 → 1820.94] But really
[1820.94 → 1821.34] When we say
[1821.34 → 1822.04] Spiritual disciplines
[1822.04 → 1822.76] What we're talking about
[1822.76 → 1823.54] Is the habits
[1823.54 → 1824.36] That Jesus himself
[1824.36 → 1825.30] Lived in his ministry
[1825.30 → 1826.32] And the very things
[1826.32 → 1827.24] He taught his disciples
[1827.24 → 1827.72] To do
[1827.72 → 1828.84] As he trained them up
[1828.84 → 1829.36] For ministry
[1829.36 → 1830.90] These habits
[1830.90 → 1831.86] Include
[1831.86 → 1833.26] Sabbath
[1833.26 → 1835.18] Silence
[1835.18 → 1836.72] Solitude
[1836.72 → 1838.14] Prayer
[1838.14 → 1839.92] Fasting
[1839.92 → 1841.84] The reading of scripture
[1841.84 → 1843.86] Intentional community
[1843.86 → 1845.26] Worship
[1845.26 → 1847.30] Breaking bread with others
[1847.30 → 1848.38] Hospitality
[1848.38 → 1849.68] Simplicity
[1849.68 → 1851.14] Gratitude
[1851.14 → 1852.70] Celebration
[1852.70 → 1852.72] Celebration
[1852.72 → 1853.96] Lament
[1853.96 → 1855.32] Grieving
[1855.32 → 1856.72] Serving
[1856.72 → 1858.04] And more
[1858.04 → 1860.66] And I don't know
[1860.66 → 1861.58] What comes to your mind
[1861.58 → 1862.60] When I say the phrase
[1862.60 → 1863.46] Spiritual disciplines
[1863.46 → 1864.82] But often we imagine
[1864.82 → 1865.74] It's sort of the act
[1865.74 → 1866.70] Of going into your room
[1866.70 → 1867.58] All by yourself
[1867.58 → 1868.58] In total silence
[1868.58 → 1869.68] And doing something
[1869.68 → 1870.76] Or not doing something
[1870.76 → 1871.36] And it's important
[1871.36 → 1871.84] That you see
[1871.84 → 1872.94] Even in Jesus' own life
[1872.94 → 1873.48] And ministry
[1873.48 → 1874.88] That spiritual disciplines
[1874.88 → 1875.68] Were both personal
[1875.68 → 1876.10] Private
[1876.10 → 1877.08] And communal
[1877.08 → 1877.86] And active
[1877.86 → 1878.56] There were things
[1878.56 → 1879.34] That you refrain from
[1879.34 → 1879.76] And also things
[1879.76 → 1880.28] That you do
[1880.28 → 1881.20] And you do those
[1881.20 → 1881.94] Things together
[1881.94 → 1882.62] And we'll come back
[1882.62 → 1882.96] To that
[1882.96 → 1884.16] In just a minute
[1884.16 → 1887.02] But it's important
[1887.02 → 1887.96] To realize also
[1887.96 → 1889.68] That as apprentices
[1889.68 → 1890.66] Followed Jesus
[1890.66 → 1891.48] They saw that
[1891.48 → 1892.42] As they wanted
[1892.42 → 1893.46] To live the life
[1893.46 → 1894.02] Of Jesus
[1894.02 → 1894.72] It came
[1894.72 → 1895.38] As Pastor Sid
[1895.38 → 1896.12] Said a few months ago
[1896.12 → 1896.88] Through the life
[1896.88 → 1898.64] Style of Jesus
[1898.64 → 1900.60] Adopting his habits
[1900.60 → 1901.26] His practice
[1901.26 → 1902.62] His way of living
[1902.62 → 1903.16] In the kingdom
[1903.16 → 1904.20] And as they adopted
[1904.20 → 1904.54] Those
[1904.54 → 1905.32] As they brought
[1905.32 → 1906.00] Those habits
[1906.00 → 1906.64] Into their life
[1906.64 → 1907.28] They were able
[1907.28 → 1907.88] To move
[1907.88 → 1908.52] In the direction
[1908.52 → 1909.14] Of Jesus
[1909.14 → 1910.34] By the power
[1910.34 → 1910.90] Of the spirit
[1910.90 → 1911.94] And by the grace
[1911.94 → 1912.38] Of Jesus
[1912.38 → 1915.76] Now whenever I talk
[1915.76 → 1917.04] About spiritual disciplines
[1917.04 → 1918.78] I have this voice
[1918.78 → 1919.66] In the back of my head
[1919.66 → 1920.32] I think it's this
[1920.32 → 1921.24] Reformed voice
[1921.24 → 1922.44] That wants to say to me
[1922.44 → 1923.38] Wait a minute
[1923.38 → 1924.16] Pastor Dave
[1924.16 → 1926.22] Are you telling me
[1926.22 → 1926.92] The Christian life
[1926.92 → 1928.30] Is just a set of practices
[1928.30 → 1929.56] That it's just
[1929.56 → 1930.32] A bunch of habits
[1930.32 → 1930.98] And if you do
[1930.98 → 1931.68] These things
[1931.68 → 1932.56] You'll be saved
[1932.56 → 1933.28] And if you don't
[1933.28 → 1933.86] Do these things
[1933.86 → 1934.94] You won't be saved
[1934.94 → 1936.14] Doesn't this sound
[1936.14 → 1937.18] A little bit like
[1937.18 → 1938.56] Works based righteousness
[1938.56 → 1939.96] Doesn't this sound
[1939.96 → 1940.80] A little bit like
[1940.80 → 1941.92] Self salvation
[1941.92 → 1943.58] And where is the grace
[1943.58 → 1944.60] In all of this
[1944.60 → 1946.02] I find that voice
[1946.02 → 1946.62] In the back of my head
[1946.62 → 1947.42] Every time I talk
[1947.42 → 1948.62] About spiritual disciplines
[1948.62 → 1949.84] And I want to say
[1949.84 → 1951.02] Unequivocally at the outset
[1951.02 → 1952.12] Spiritual disciplines
[1952.12 → 1953.40] And adopting these habits
[1953.40 → 1954.36] That Jesus taught us
[1954.36 → 1954.80] In our lives
[1954.80 → 1955.84] Is not the means
[1955.84 → 1957.22] By which we are saved
[1957.22 → 1959.04] Salvation is by grace
[1959.04 → 1959.38] Alone
[1959.38 → 1959.98] It's through the work
[1959.98 → 1960.86] Of Jesus on the cross
[1960.86 → 1961.60] That finds us
[1961.60 → 1962.22] In our rebellion
[1962.22 → 1963.38] We're freed in
[1963.38 → 1964.32] And through what he does
[1964.32 → 1965.56] Through faith in him
[1965.56 → 1967.20] It's no work of our own
[1967.20 → 1969.30] The spiritual disciplines
[1969.30 → 1970.78] Are the way
[1970.78 → 1972.16] That we open ourselves
[1972.16 → 1973.38] To the ongoing work
[1973.38 → 1974.44] Of grace in our lives
[1974.44 → 1975.42] It's the way
[1975.42 → 1976.22] That we allow
[1976.22 → 1977.40] God's work
[1977.40 → 1978.54] And Jesus' transformation
[1978.54 → 1979.50] And the power
[1979.50 → 1980.02] Of the spirit
[1980.02 → 1981.40] To continue forming
[1981.40 → 1982.06] And shaping
[1982.06 → 1983.36] And transforming us
[1983.36 → 1984.28] Into the likeness
[1984.28 → 1984.80] Of Jesus
[1984.80 → 1986.20] Or the distinction
[1986.20 → 1986.92] You could use is
[1986.92 → 1988.38] We have nothing to do
[1988.38 → 1989.28] With our sanctification
[1989.28 → 1990.80] But we are participants
[1990.80 → 1992.16] In
[1992.16 → 1992.48] Sorry
[1992.48 → 1992.92] We have nothing
[1992.92 → 1993.52] To do with justification
[1993.52 → 1994.40] We are participants
[1994.40 → 1995.98] In our sanctification
[1995.98 → 1996.86] And I think
[1996.86 → 1997.98] We just need to name
[1997.98 → 2000.06] That often
[2000.06 → 2000.88] We've thought
[2000.88 → 2002.10] Of growth in our life
[2002.10 → 2002.84] As disciples
[2002.84 → 2004.10] As a sort of
[2004.10 → 2004.94] Passive thing
[2004.94 → 2006.18] Or we think
[2006.18 → 2006.68] That somehow
[2006.68 → 2007.78] We can become like Jesus
[2007.78 → 2008.88] Just by sitting back
[2008.88 → 2010.06] And hoping the spirit
[2010.06 → 2010.70] Does something
[2010.70 → 2011.46] And hoping that God
[2011.46 → 2011.86] Just sort of
[2011.86 → 2012.98] Continues to change us
[2012.98 → 2013.62] Even though we're not
[2013.62 → 2014.50] Really participating
[2014.50 → 2015.40] In the process
[2015.40 → 2016.26] And it's not going
[2016.26 → 2016.80] Very well
[2016.80 → 2018.64] It's not going
[2018.64 → 2019.04] Very well
[2019.04 → 2020.12] For the western church
[2020.12 → 2021.14] As we think of
[2021.14 → 2022.34] Our discipleship
[2022.34 → 2023.62] As a passive process
[2023.62 → 2024.60] And we need to name
[2024.60 → 2025.54] The fact that we can
[2025.54 → 2026.56] Stifle
[2026.56 → 2028.02] And silence
[2028.02 → 2028.94] The spirit's work
[2028.94 → 2030.70] As we think about
[2030.70 → 2031.66] Our growth in Christ
[2031.66 → 2032.48] And the disciplines
[2032.48 → 2033.92] Are means by which
[2033.92 → 2035.18] We open our lives
[2035.18 → 2036.50] And invite God
[2036.50 → 2037.24] To bring about
[2037.24 → 2037.98] The transformation
[2037.98 → 2039.08] In our lives
[2039.08 → 2040.50] Of which he wants
[2040.50 → 2041.26] To make us like
[2041.26 → 2041.94] In Jesus
[2041.94 → 2046.36] Now I'm struck
[2046.36 → 2046.86] And we're going to look
[2046.86 → 2047.72] At a number of passages
[2047.72 → 2048.36] This morning
[2048.36 → 2049.32] I'm struck by how
[2049.32 → 2050.16] The gospel writers
[2050.16 → 2051.04] Don't live in that
[2051.04 → 2051.78] Same kind of tension
[2051.78 → 2052.72] That we often feel
[2052.72 → 2053.28] Calling this
[2053.28 → 2054.32] Workspace righteousness
[2054.32 → 2055.00] And I want to just
[2055.00 → 2055.64] Work through a number
[2055.64 → 2056.46] Of habits that we see
[2056.46 → 2057.44] The church practicing
[2057.44 → 2058.40] In Jesus himself
[2058.40 → 2060.60] The gospel accounts
[2060.60 → 2061.28] As they talk about
[2061.28 → 2061.82] Jesus' life
[2061.82 → 2062.44] They have no problem
[2062.44 → 2063.08] Sharing with us
[2063.08 → 2063.76] His habits
[2063.76 → 2064.82] And one of the habits
[2064.82 → 2066.04] That Luke in particular
[2066.04 → 2066.64] Has an interest
[2066.64 → 2067.48] In talking about
[2067.48 → 2068.96] Is Jesus retreating
[2068.96 → 2069.74] In silence
[2069.74 → 2071.12] And solitude
[2071.12 → 2072.02] And prayer
[2072.02 → 2072.62] And fasting
[2072.62 → 2073.46] Luke talks more
[2073.46 → 2074.52] About Jesus' solitude
[2074.52 → 2074.94] And prayer
[2074.94 → 2075.52] Than any other
[2075.52 → 2076.36] Gospel account
[2076.36 → 2077.46] And it's very interesting
[2077.46 → 2078.18] Because Luke wants us
[2078.18 → 2078.56] To know that
[2078.56 → 2079.46] Even though the demands
[2079.46 → 2079.86] Of Jesus
[2079.86 → 2081.10] Are very high
[2081.10 → 2082.36] I mean Jesus is a healer
[2082.36 → 2082.88] He's a teacher
[2082.88 → 2083.72] He has power
[2083.72 → 2084.52] People really want
[2084.52 → 2084.98] His attention
[2084.98 → 2085.68] They bring the sick
[2085.68 → 2086.10] To him
[2086.10 → 2087.76] Jesus often pushes back
[2087.76 → 2089.30] The demands of the crowd
[2089.30 → 2090.86] And goes to be by himself
[2090.86 → 2091.48] With the Father
[2091.48 → 2092.48] And I want to read for you
[2092.48 → 2093.84] Luke chapter 5
[2093.84 → 2094.50] Verse 16
[2094.50 → 2096.68] We read
[2096.68 → 2097.84] Yet news about him
[2097.84 → 2098.34] That's Jesus
[2098.34 → 2099.66] Spread all the more
[2099.66 → 2100.80] So that crowds
[2100.80 → 2101.48] Of people came
[2101.48 → 2102.10] To hear him
[2102.10 → 2102.72] And be healed
[2102.72 → 2104.00] Of their sicknesses
[2104.00 → 2105.08] But Jesus
[2105.08 → 2107.38] Often withdrew
[2107.38 → 2108.42] To lonely places
[2108.42 → 2109.14] And prayed
[2109.14 → 2111.80] What a verse there
[2111.80 → 2113.48] Jesus often
[2113.48 → 2115.84] Withdrew to lonely places
[2115.84 → 2117.22] And prayed
[2117.22 → 2118.64] As the demands grew
[2118.64 → 2119.58] So did his running
[2119.58 → 2120.50] To the side of the mountain
[2120.50 → 2121.56] To be in the presence
[2121.56 → 2122.16] Of his Father
[2122.16 → 2123.26] To be grounded
[2123.26 → 2123.96] In his love
[2123.96 → 2124.52] So that he could
[2124.52 → 2125.86] Do his ministry faithfully
[2125.86 → 2127.48] That's how Jesus
[2127.48 → 2128.76] Operated in his ministry
[2128.76 → 2130.32] Now if you think
[2130.32 → 2131.16] Of so many people today
[2131.16 → 2132.00] You'd see the demands
[2132.00 → 2132.40] Of ministry
[2132.40 → 2133.36] The excitement of ministry
[2133.36 → 2133.84] The healing
[2133.84 → 2134.30] The power
[2134.30 → 2135.14] There'd be this demand
[2135.14 → 2136.28] To stay even more present
[2136.28 → 2137.32] And dialled into the people
[2137.32 → 2138.72] But Jesus withdraws
[2138.72 → 2139.68] All the more
[2139.68 → 2141.04] So that he can do
[2141.04 → 2141.88] The work that Jesus
[2141.88 → 2142.80] He was sent to do
[2142.80 → 2143.40] By the Father
[2143.40 → 2146.62] In Luke 4 verse 1
[2146.62 → 2148.24] We find that after
[2148.24 → 2149.48] 40 days of fasting
[2149.48 → 2150.06] And praying
[2150.06 → 2150.82] Jesus emerges
[2150.82 → 2151.72] Into his ministry
[2151.72 → 2152.36] And we're told
[2152.36 → 2153.80] Full of the power
[2153.80 → 2154.76] Of the Holy Spirit
[2154.76 → 2156.06] I'm actually struck
[2156.06 → 2156.88] By that whole scene
[2156.88 → 2157.78] In Luke chapter 4
[2157.78 → 2159.40] Where Jesus is drawn out
[2159.40 → 2160.00] Into the desert
[2160.00 → 2161.34] For 40 days of fasting
[2161.34 → 2162.00] And prayer
[2162.00 → 2162.78] And temptation
[2162.78 → 2164.10] And it's in this context
[2164.10 → 2165.36] That Satan perhaps thinks
[2165.36 → 2166.76] Jesus has been fasting
[2166.76 → 2167.80] For 40 days
[2167.80 → 2169.94] He's probably weak
[2169.94 → 2172.04] He's probably vulnerable
[2172.04 → 2173.68] And maybe this is the point
[2173.68 → 2174.68] At which to tempt him
[2174.68 → 2175.74] With influence
[2175.74 → 2177.04] And with power
[2177.04 → 2178.16] And maybe this will be
[2178.16 → 2178.90] The place where I can
[2178.90 → 2180.10] Convince Jesus to worship
[2180.10 → 2181.66] And bow down to me
[2181.66 → 2182.98] The deceiver
[2182.98 → 2184.62] Little did Satan know
[2184.62 → 2186.02] That Jesus by being alone
[2186.02 → 2186.66] With the Father
[2186.66 → 2187.68] Fasting and praying
[2187.68 → 2188.68] Was his source
[2188.68 → 2189.56] Of great strength
[2189.56 → 2191.58] And that contrary
[2191.58 → 2192.40] To what Satan thought
[2192.40 → 2192.86] Was possible
[2192.86 → 2193.68] Jesus was able
[2193.68 → 2195.40] To resist all the temptation
[2195.40 → 2197.04] Because he had been
[2197.04 → 2197.54] In prayer
[2197.54 → 2198.76] And because he had been
[2198.76 → 2199.32] Fasting
[2199.32 → 2203.88] I want you to look
[2203.88 → 2204.54] With me now
[2204.54 → 2206.22] At Acts chapter 2
[2206.22 → 2206.82] Now we're looking
[2206.82 → 2207.76] At the church itself
[2207.76 → 2208.52] Jesus practiced
[2208.52 → 2209.20] This lifestyle
[2209.20 → 2209.72] And I could talk
[2209.72 → 2210.30] Much more about
[2210.30 → 2211.02] The practice of Jesus
[2211.02 → 2211.70] But now we get
[2211.70 → 2212.54] To the early church
[2212.54 → 2214.28] This exciting scene
[2214.28 → 2215.08] In Acts chapter 2
[2215.08 → 2215.54] Where people are
[2215.54 → 2216.20] Coming to faith
[2216.20 → 2217.12] They're gathering together
[2217.12 → 2217.76] They're sorting out
[2217.76 → 2218.34] What it means to be
[2218.34 → 2219.22] Disciples and apprentices
[2219.22 → 2219.70] Of Jesus
[2219.70 → 2220.90] The first thing
[2220.90 → 2222.18] That Luke tells us
[2222.18 → 2223.06] This is Luke's second
[2223.06 → 2225.74] Account in the book of Acts
[2225.74 → 2226.78] The first thing he says
[2226.78 → 2227.56] To us about the church
[2227.56 → 2228.18] Is this
[2228.18 → 2229.42] Before anything about mission
[2229.42 → 2230.72] Anything about evangelism
[2230.72 → 2231.66] Anything about church planting
[2231.66 → 2233.24] We read in Acts 2, 42
[2233.24 → 2235.92] They devoted themselves
[2235.92 → 2237.60] To the apostles' teaching
[2237.60 → 2239.18] And to fellowship
[2239.18 → 2241.00] To the breaking of bread
[2241.00 → 2242.26] And to prayer
[2242.26 → 2244.54] What's this passage
[2244.54 → 2245.16] Talking about
[2245.16 → 2246.58] This passage
[2246.58 → 2247.42] Is talking about
[2247.42 → 2248.58] The practices
[2248.58 → 2249.80] The communal practices
[2249.80 → 2250.68] That the early church
[2250.68 → 2253.06] Devoted themselves to
[2253.06 → 2255.06] Before anything happens
[2255.06 → 2255.72] In the cities
[2255.72 → 2256.36] And evangelism
[2256.36 → 2257.12] We're told that
[2257.12 → 2257.88] These believers
[2257.88 → 2258.64] They gathered together
[2258.64 → 2259.72] And they were devoted
[2259.72 → 2260.52] They weren't just
[2260.52 → 2261.10] Interested in
[2261.10 → 2261.58] They weren't just
[2261.58 → 2263.10] Sort of marginally curious
[2263.10 → 2263.32] About
[2263.32 → 2264.20] They were devoted
[2264.20 → 2265.26] To the scriptures
[2265.26 → 2266.30] To fellowship
[2266.30 → 2267.66] To the breaking of bread
[2267.66 → 2268.50] And to prayer
[2268.50 → 2269.38] This was like
[2269.38 → 2270.30] The lifeblood
[2270.30 → 2270.84] Of the church
[2270.84 → 2271.64] And we preached on this
[2271.64 → 2272.56] Just a few years ago
[2272.56 → 2273.68] But this notion
[2273.68 → 2274.24] That the church
[2274.24 → 2275.12] Saw themselves as
[2275.12 → 2276.46] This is what we do
[2276.46 → 2278.20] These are our shared practices
[2278.20 → 2279.08] This is what it means
[2279.08 → 2279.88] To be the church
[2279.88 → 2280.74] And if you've been
[2280.74 → 2281.88] In a new members class
[2281.88 → 2282.44] That we've done
[2282.44 → 2282.88] At our church
[2282.88 → 2283.38] You'll know that
[2283.38 → 2284.14] I often talk about
[2284.14 → 2285.34] Acts 2 42
[2285.34 → 2287.76] As four channels of grace
[2287.76 → 2289.44] These aren't practices
[2289.44 → 2290.46] They do just for the sake
[2290.46 → 2291.06] Of the practices
[2291.06 → 2292.24] These are things they do
[2292.24 → 2293.58] So that they can experience
[2293.58 → 2294.34] The life of God
[2294.34 → 2295.68] Breaking into their community
[2295.68 → 2297.56] As they gather together
[2297.56 → 2298.78] And commit to community
[2298.78 → 2300.00] They find the spirit
[2300.00 → 2301.42] Working in their midst
[2301.42 → 2302.62] Giving them love
[2302.62 → 2303.18] For one another
[2303.18 → 2304.36] And grace for one another
[2304.36 → 2305.58] And patience for one another
[2305.58 → 2307.36] As they listen
[2307.36 → 2308.14] To the scriptures
[2308.14 → 2309.04] Being read
[2309.04 → 2310.38] To the community at large
[2310.38 → 2311.66] They experience the spirit
[2311.66 → 2312.78] Ministering to them
[2312.78 → 2313.80] The truth of the gospel
[2313.80 → 2314.68] Who they are
[2314.68 → 2315.64] Who Jesus is
[2315.64 → 2316.66] The true story
[2316.66 → 2317.40] Of the whole world
[2317.40 → 2319.46] As they break bread together
[2319.46 → 2320.56] They remember the death
[2320.56 → 2320.98] Of Jesus
[2320.98 → 2321.74] And what he has done
[2321.74 → 2322.34] For his world
[2322.34 → 2323.12] And for them
[2323.12 → 2324.54] And the spirit is ministering
[2324.54 → 2326.04] To them as they break bread
[2326.04 → 2327.80] And as they pray
[2327.80 → 2329.24] They feel the spirit
[2329.24 → 2330.90] Moving in their midst
[2330.90 → 2332.52] Empowering them
[2332.52 → 2334.02] Transforming them
[2334.02 → 2335.34] Sending them
[2335.34 → 2336.26] To be good news
[2336.26 → 2336.90] In their city
[2336.90 → 2338.18] These four things
[2338.18 → 2340.36] Are channels of grace
[2340.36 → 2341.82] And as they practice them
[2341.82 → 2342.88] And they're tilling the soil
[2342.88 → 2344.20] And the spirit is at work
[2344.20 → 2345.74] Bringing about the transformation
[2345.74 → 2347.86] To be like Jesus
[2347.86 → 2349.86] But it's through
[2349.86 → 2351.78] Practices
[2351.78 → 2354.22] And this isn't self-salvation
[2354.22 → 2356.08] This isn't works-based righteousness
[2356.08 → 2357.90] This is a desire for the church
[2357.90 → 2359.60] To do the things Jesus did
[2359.60 → 2361.12] So that the life of Jesus
[2361.12 → 2362.40] Enters into the community
[2362.40 → 2365.68] And so often again
[2365.68 → 2367.36] We don't realize
[2367.36 → 2368.22] That apprenticeship
[2368.22 → 2369.46] Is a commitment
[2369.46 → 2370.60] To a lifestyle
[2370.60 → 2372.40] And the early church
[2372.40 → 2374.02] They understood that
[2374.02 → 2375.36] They understood that
[2375.36 → 2376.32] Becoming an apprentice
[2376.32 → 2376.92] Of Jesus
[2376.92 → 2378.16] Is to begin
[2378.16 → 2379.32] Putting on your calendar
[2379.32 → 2380.50] A new set of habits
[2380.50 → 2382.18] A new set of practices
[2382.18 → 2383.82] A new lifestyle
[2383.82 → 2385.78] And also at the same time
[2385.78 → 2386.34] Putting away
[2386.34 → 2387.76] An old set of practices
[2387.76 → 2388.92] Old habits
[2388.92 → 2390.06] And an old lifestyle
[2390.06 → 2391.02] And these new habits
[2391.02 → 2391.78] Are going to be the means
[2391.78 → 2392.32] By which
[2392.32 → 2394.06] They continue to discover
[2394.06 → 2395.48] The love of the Father
[2395.48 → 2396.50] The grace of Jesus
[2396.50 → 2398.74] And the power of the Holy Spirit
[2398.74 → 2400.46] Through practices
[2400.46 → 2403.12] Now let's look at
[2403.12 → 2403.98] A couple verses
[2403.98 → 2404.88] From Paul's letters
[2404.88 → 2405.50] The first is
[2405.50 → 2406.50] 1 Corinthians 9
[2406.50 → 2407.54] And I just want to say
[2407.54 → 2408.76] I'm not going to do justice to this
[2408.76 → 2409.88] Pastor Sid was going to preach
[2409.88 → 2411.32] On mostly just this passage
[2411.32 → 2411.92] This morning
[2411.92 → 2412.90] But I'm just going to
[2412.90 → 2413.70] Reference it briefly
[2413.70 → 2415.84] Paul of course
[2415.84 → 2416.96] Is in a city
[2416.96 → 2418.06] That loves the Olympics
[2418.06 → 2419.18] The Olympics were there
[2419.18 → 2420.12] Before Paul visited
[2420.12 → 2420.68] And also again
[2420.68 → 2421.58] After Paul visited
[2421.58 → 2422.52] And so he's using the Olympics
[2422.52 → 2423.44] As an illustration
[2423.44 → 2424.14] And he writes
[2424.14 → 2425.78] Everyone who competes
[2425.78 → 2426.30] In the games
[2426.30 → 2427.18] Goes into what?
[2427.72 → 2428.48] To strict training
[2428.48 → 2430.34] They do it to get a crown
[2430.34 → 2431.34] That will not last
[2431.34 → 2432.60] But we do it
[2432.60 → 2433.40] To get a crown
[2433.40 → 2434.90] That will last forever
[2434.90 → 2436.78] Therefore do not run
[2436.78 → 2437.96] Like someone running aimlessly
[2437.96 → 2439.22] And I do not fight
[2439.22 → 2440.80] Like a boxer beating the air
[2440.80 → 2441.22] No
[2441.22 → 2443.96] I strike a blow to my body
[2443.96 → 2445.78] And make it my slave
[2445.78 → 2447.46] So after I have preached to others
[2447.46 → 2448.40] I myself
[2448.40 → 2450.30] Will not be disqualified
[2450.30 → 2451.26] For the prize
[2451.26 → 2454.12] That is a powerful passage
[2454.12 → 2456.22] Here's Paul
[2456.22 → 2457.22] Who has experienced
[2457.22 → 2458.20] The depth of grace
[2458.20 → 2459.04] The power of Jesus
[2459.04 → 2460.02] Who knocked him over
[2460.02 → 2461.00] On the way to Damascus
[2461.00 → 2461.90] Revealed to him
[2461.90 → 2462.84] The depth of the gospel
[2462.84 → 2463.82] And the identity of Jesus
[2463.82 → 2464.86] And Paul is saying
[2464.86 → 2466.84] This is where I'm going
[2466.84 → 2468.26] I am disciplining myself
[2468.26 → 2469.28] I am training
[2469.28 → 2471.26] I am working towards
[2471.26 → 2472.08] This way of life
[2472.08 → 2472.94] So that I would not
[2472.94 → 2473.62] Be disqualified
[2473.62 → 2474.78] So that many would hear
[2474.78 → 2475.76] The gospel of Jesus
[2475.76 → 2476.80] And so that I would
[2476.80 → 2477.72] Attain the prize
[2477.72 → 2479.38] Of being with Christ
[2479.38 → 2480.58] And living in his kingdom
[2480.58 → 2481.02] Forever
[2481.02 → 2483.02] There is no tension
[2483.02 → 2483.60] In Paul
[2483.60 → 2484.88] About discipleship
[2484.88 → 2485.70] Being about
[2485.70 → 2486.64] Training
[2486.64 → 2488.50] About discipline
[2488.50 → 2490.12] And self-control
[2490.12 → 2493.46] I wonder
[2493.46 → 2494.38] What it would look like
[2494.38 → 2495.56] If we as a church
[2495.56 → 2496.60] Understood
[2496.60 → 2497.70] Discipleship
[2497.70 → 2498.32] And apprenticeship
[2498.32 → 2500.34] As being in a community
[2500.34 → 2501.30] That is training
[2501.30 → 2501.88] Together
[2501.88 → 2503.70] In the way of Christ
[2503.70 → 2504.70] That we see
[2504.70 → 2505.30] What we're doing
[2505.30 → 2506.00] When we worship
[2506.00 → 2506.88] When we gather
[2506.88 → 2507.66] When we pray
[2507.66 → 2508.52] When we read the scriptures
[2508.52 → 2509.08] When we serve
[2509.08 → 2509.96] We are training
[2509.96 → 2511.36] In the way of Christ
[2511.36 → 2512.72] The way of the kingdom
[2512.72 → 2514.04] And I find
[2514.04 → 2514.92] When I read that passage
[2514.92 → 2515.90] In 1 Corinthians 9
[2515.90 → 2517.10] I often think of the words
[2517.10 → 2517.90] From Dallas Willard
[2517.90 → 2518.56] Perhaps some of his
[2518.56 → 2519.42] Most famous words
[2519.42 → 2519.94] Where he says
[2519.94 → 2521.46] Grace is not
[2521.46 → 2522.84] Opposed to effort
[2522.84 → 2524.68] Grace is opposed
[2524.68 → 2525.76] To earning
[2525.76 → 2527.36] And what Paul says
[2527.36 → 2527.90] About the life
[2527.90 → 2528.44] Of an apprentice
[2528.44 → 2530.22] Is the life of training
[2530.22 → 2532.16] Very deliberate
[2532.16 → 2533.22] Training
[2533.22 → 2534.54] In the way of Christ
[2534.54 → 2535.78] Finally
[2535.78 → 2536.46] I want us to look at
[2536.46 → 2537.06] Philippians 2
[2537.06 → 2538.00] 12 to 13
[2538.00 → 2539.48] These are some verses
[2539.48 → 2540.00] That were preached
[2540.00 → 2540.74] Actually at Brittany
[2540.74 → 2541.34] In my wedding
[2541.34 → 2542.12] Some years ago
[2542.12 → 2543.68] And often times
[2543.68 → 2544.22] We look at the first
[2544.22 → 2544.78] 11 verses
[2544.78 → 2546.00] Which are powerful verses
[2546.00 → 2547.04] About the person of Jesus
[2547.04 → 2548.30] Who emptied himself
[2548.30 → 2549.14] Who became a servant
[2549.14 → 2549.94] Who became a slave
[2549.94 → 2550.50] And he died
[2550.50 → 2551.06] A sinner's death
[2551.06 → 2551.54] On the cross
[2551.54 → 2552.66] And then he was exalted
[2552.66 → 2553.68] To the highest place
[2553.68 → 2554.88] That every knee should bow
[2554.88 → 2555.82] And every tongue confess
[2555.82 → 2557.08] That Jesus is Lord
[2557.08 → 2558.14] These are the verses
[2558.14 → 2560.38] Right after that beautiful statement
[2560.38 → 2560.88] It says
[2560.88 → 2561.80] Therefore
[2561.80 → 2564.16] My dear friends
[2564.16 → 2566.28] As you have always obeyed
[2566.28 → 2567.26] Not only in my presence
[2567.26 → 2568.22] But now much more
[2568.22 → 2568.88] In my absence
[2568.88 → 2570.40] Continue to work out
[2570.40 → 2571.08] Your salvation
[2571.08 → 2572.34] With fear and trembling
[2572.34 → 2573.44] For it is God
[2573.44 → 2574.76] Who works in you
[2574.76 → 2577.10] To will and to act
[2577.10 → 2578.52] In order to fulfill
[2578.52 → 2579.34] His good purpose
[2579.34 → 2581.74] Now a lot of ink
[2581.74 → 2582.40] Has been spilled
[2582.40 → 2583.14] Trying to figure out
[2583.14 → 2583.62] That passage
[2583.62 → 2584.66] What in the world
[2584.66 → 2585.42] Does Paul mean
[2585.42 → 2585.90] When he says
[2585.90 → 2587.88] Work out your salvation
[2587.88 → 2588.88] With fear and trembling
[2588.88 → 2589.82] At first glance
[2589.82 → 2590.28] You might think
[2590.28 → 2590.82] Wow Paul
[2590.82 → 2592.04] That almost sounds like
[2592.04 → 2592.30] You know
[2592.30 → 2593.16] Self salvation
[2593.16 → 2594.18] You're working it out
[2594.18 → 2594.92] But Paul is saying
[2594.92 → 2595.50] Nothing here
[2595.50 → 2596.06] He hasn't said
[2596.06 → 2597.34] In so many other places
[2597.34 → 2598.84] Paul recognizes
[2598.84 → 2599.62] That the gospel
[2599.62 → 2600.56] Is a gift
[2600.56 → 2602.40] The gospel is pure grace
[2602.40 → 2603.46] It's the work of Jesus
[2603.46 → 2605.34] To be received by faith
[2605.34 → 2606.56] And what he's saying here
[2606.56 → 2607.36] Is that we work out
[2607.36 → 2608.90] The gift in our lives
[2608.90 → 2610.16] It's like unwrapping
[2610.16 → 2610.94] This gift for the rest
[2610.94 → 2611.32] Of our lives
[2611.32 → 2612.02] And looking at
[2612.02 → 2613.30] How it looks to live
[2613.30 → 2613.92] In this freedom
[2613.92 → 2615.80] In our ordinary daily lives
[2615.80 → 2617.24] For the rest of our lives
[2617.24 → 2619.16] This is not workspace
[2619.16 → 2620.80] Righteousness at all
[2620.80 → 2622.36] And the beauty of it
[2622.36 → 2623.60] Is that Paul realizes
[2623.60 → 2624.76] That all of our effort
[2624.76 → 2625.62] All of our desire
[2625.62 → 2626.70] To work out our salvation
[2626.70 → 2628.36] And be apprentices of Jesus
[2628.36 → 2629.36] Is done in and through
[2629.36 → 2630.30] The power of Christ
[2630.30 → 2631.78] By the work of the Spirit
[2631.78 → 2633.54] It's all grace
[2633.54 → 2636.42] And an illustration
[2636.42 → 2637.86] This comes from Alec Mother
[2637.86 → 2639.10] That I really appreciate
[2639.10 → 2640.10] On this passage
[2640.10 → 2642.16] Is the illustration of a wedding
[2642.16 → 2643.74] And Alec Mother says
[2643.74 → 2644.64] Paul isn't talking about
[2644.64 → 2645.74] People getting saved
[2645.74 → 2646.66] He's talking about
[2646.66 → 2647.62] How saved people
[2647.62 → 2648.76] Work out their salvation
[2648.76 → 2649.96] In ordinary life
[2649.96 → 2651.92] Think of a marriage
[2651.92 → 2653.40] Now if you go
[2653.40 → 2654.08] To a wedding
[2654.08 → 2654.80] You'll see a couple
[2654.80 → 2655.56] On the stage
[2655.56 → 2657.24] They stand holding hands
[2657.24 → 2658.04] And they give their vows
[2658.04 → 2658.66] To one another
[2658.66 → 2660.54] And after that ceremony
[2660.54 → 2661.42] After the celebration
[2661.42 → 2662.14] In the community
[2662.14 → 2663.66] They are a married couple
[2663.66 → 2664.96] But do they know
[2664.96 → 2665.64] What it means to be
[2665.64 → 2666.26] A married couple
[2666.26 → 2668.22] When they get married
[2668.22 → 2670.24] Good question
[2670.24 → 2671.42] I remember hearing
[2671.42 → 2672.42] An older fellow
[2672.42 → 2673.06] Who was at a wedding
[2673.06 → 2673.72] Some years ago
[2673.72 → 2674.44] And he said to me
[2674.44 → 2675.96] Sometimes I just chuckle
[2675.96 → 2677.38] Watching this young couple
[2677.38 → 2678.04] This beautiful
[2678.04 → 2678.42] You know
[2678.42 → 2679.46] Twenty something year olds
[2679.46 → 2681.42] Expressing these incredible vows
[2681.42 → 2682.26] Of being with each other
[2682.26 → 2683.14] In sickness and health
[2683.14 → 2683.88] For rich or for poor
[2683.88 → 2685.20] They have no idea
[2685.20 → 2686.58] What they're committing to
[2686.58 → 2687.76] When they're up on that stage
[2687.76 → 2688.96] Giving their vows
[2688.96 → 2689.56] To one another
[2689.56 → 2690.94] They need to learn
[2690.94 → 2691.88] What it looks like
[2691.88 → 2693.26] To live into those vows
[2693.26 → 2695.64] That's what we're talking about here
[2695.64 → 2696.46] In fact I remember
[2696.46 → 2697.48] When Brittany and I got married
[2697.48 → 2698.62] We got a number of cards
[2698.62 → 2699.92] And some of those cards
[2699.92 → 2700.48] Were very generic
[2700.48 → 2701.20] Just with names
[2701.20 → 2702.20] And a wedding gift
[2702.20 → 2702.74] But some of them
[2702.74 → 2703.58] Were really filled
[2703.58 → 2704.42] With advice
[2704.42 → 2705.64] And encouragement
[2705.64 → 2706.96] Saying treasure
[2706.96 → 2707.86] The gift of marriage
[2707.86 → 2709.66] And protect the gift of marriage
[2709.66 → 2711.16] Invest in marriage
[2711.16 → 2711.78] And there's advice
[2711.78 → 2712.16] And sort of
[2712.16 → 2713.52] Make sure you go on dates
[2713.52 → 2714.46] And make sure you do this
[2714.46 → 2716.08] Basically take seriously
[2716.08 → 2716.62] This gift
[2716.62 → 2717.50] And receive it
[2717.50 → 2719.24] And work at it
[2719.24 → 2721.50] So that you can live
[2721.50 → 2722.30] In this identity
[2722.30 → 2723.02] As a married couple
[2723.02 → 2724.30] Faithfully and well
[2724.30 → 2725.26] And we all know
[2725.26 → 2727.62] How well marriage can go
[2727.62 → 2728.80] When we just coast along
[2728.80 → 2729.50] For decades
[2729.50 → 2731.48] It's destined for pain
[2731.48 → 2733.72] And destined for brokenness
[2733.72 → 2735.86] So it is with apprenticeship
[2735.86 → 2737.58] We receive the gift of Christ
[2737.58 → 2738.88] We receive the gift of salvation
[2738.88 → 2740.38] And we spend the rest of our lives
[2740.38 → 2740.82] Together
[2740.82 → 2741.88] Working out
[2741.88 → 2743.38] How to live into the freedom
[2743.38 → 2745.48] Live into the life of salvation
[2745.48 → 2746.44] That Jesus has given us
[2746.44 → 2747.78] In our daily habits
[2747.78 → 2748.94] And our daily routines
[2748.94 → 2750.78] And our daily lives together
[2750.78 → 2753.74] And it takes picking up our calendars
[2753.74 → 2756.44] And plugging into our calendars
[2756.44 → 2758.96] How we want to live into this freedom
[2758.96 → 2759.88] Together
[2759.88 → 2761.64] That's apprenticeship
[2761.64 → 2764.94] And so to bring this all together
[2764.94 → 2767.08] I'm saying something very simple
[2767.08 → 2768.42] And that is
[2768.42 → 2769.68] The life of apprenticeship
[2769.68 → 2772.50] Is a life of adopting a lifestyle
[2772.50 → 2774.12] The spiritual disciplines
[2774.12 → 2775.38] The practices of Jesus
[2775.38 → 2776.58] In our own community
[2776.58 → 2777.84] In our own lives
[2777.84 → 2779.06] In our own families
[2779.06 → 2781.50] And it's not how we earn our salvation
[2781.50 → 2782.98] That's purely a gift of grace
[2782.98 → 2784.28] It's purely the work of Christ
[2784.28 → 2786.04] But it's working it out together
[2786.04 → 2787.82] So that we move in the way
[2787.82 → 2788.88] Of the kingdom together
[2788.88 → 2791.44] These habits
[2791.44 → 2792.84] Are a gift
[2792.84 → 2793.80] To the church
[2793.80 → 2795.12] These are things
[2795.12 → 2796.58] Jesus wants us
[2796.58 → 2797.96] To learn together
[2797.96 → 2801.24] They open space
[2801.24 → 2802.34] For grace
[2802.34 → 2804.62] I want to read them again
[2804.62 → 2805.60] I'm going to read them slowly
[2805.60 → 2807.62] And you can write them down
[2807.62 → 2808.06] If you want
[2808.06 → 2808.68] If you've got a pen
[2808.68 → 2809.56] Or a pencil with you
[2809.56 → 2810.92] But I do want you
[2810.92 → 2812.02] To spend time reflecting
[2812.02 → 2814.14] On how these habits
[2814.14 → 2815.78] Interact with your own life
[2815.78 → 2817.16] Which you're practicing
[2817.16 → 2818.92] Which you want to practice
[2818.92 → 2820.86] Which you're finding life in
[2820.86 → 2822.08] Which you're struggling with
[2822.08 → 2824.74] Jesus practiced
[2824.74 → 2826.34] Silence
[2826.34 → 2827.56] And solitude
[2827.56 → 2830.70] He practiced prayer
[2830.70 → 2834.08] He fasted
[2834.08 → 2837.24] Reading of the scriptures
[2837.24 → 2841.32] He lived in intentional community
[2841.32 → 2844.46] Practiced Sabbath
[2844.46 → 2846.96] Worship
[2846.96 → 2849.88] Breaking of bread
[2849.88 → 2850.94] And communion
[2850.94 → 2853.76] Practice simplicity
[2853.76 → 2856.96] Gratitude
[2856.96 → 2859.48] Celebration
[2859.48 → 2861.00] Feasts
[2861.00 → 2863.42] Grieving
[2863.42 → 2864.92] And lament
[2864.92 → 2866.96] Serving
[2866.96 → 2868.48] Living
[2868.48 → 2870.94] Loving those on the margins
[2870.94 → 2873.54] These are all
[2873.54 → 2875.22] The practices that Jesus
[2875.22 → 2876.42] Gives the church
[2876.42 → 2877.74] To follow
[2877.74 → 2879.26] Not as ways
[2879.26 → 2880.46] Of earning any points
[2880.46 → 2881.08] With God
[2881.08 → 2882.02] But as ways
[2882.02 → 2882.60] Of following
[2882.60 → 2884.06] The life of the kingdom
[2884.06 → 2885.42] Discovering the way
[2885.42 → 2886.12] We were created
[2886.12 → 2887.06] To live from the beginning
[2887.06 → 2888.52] And the way we will live
[2888.52 → 2889.96] When Jesus returns
[2889.96 → 2890.54] In power
[2890.54 → 2892.44] John Mark Comer
[2892.44 → 2893.30] Has this great quote
[2893.30 → 2894.02] On the practices
[2894.02 → 2894.72] And he writes
[2894.72 → 2896.06] These spiritual practices
[2896.06 → 2896.84] Are practices
[2896.84 → 2898.30] Based on the life of Jesus
[2898.30 → 2899.60] That create time
[2899.60 → 2900.98] And space
[2900.98 → 2902.18] For us to access
[2902.18 → 2902.96] The power
[2902.96 → 2903.54] And the presence
[2903.54 → 2904.48] Of the Holy Spirit
[2904.48 → 2905.62] And in doing so
[2905.62 → 2906.64] And I love this last part
[2906.64 → 2907.58] In doing so
[2907.58 → 2908.78] Be transformed
[2908.78 → 2910.36] From the inside out
[2910.36 → 2911.66] The goal of the practices
[2911.66 → 2912.94] Is never the practices
[2912.94 → 2913.56] Themselves
[2913.56 → 2914.94] They are always a means
[2914.94 → 2916.16] To some greater end
[2916.16 → 2916.96] And that greater end
[2916.96 → 2918.64] Is being in the presence
[2918.64 → 2919.72] Of the Father
[2919.72 → 2922.06] Savouring the love
[2922.06 → 2922.66] And the grace
[2922.66 → 2923.10] Of Jesus
[2923.10 → 2924.40] Being filled with the power
[2924.40 → 2925.24] Of the Holy Spirit
[2925.24 → 2927.34] And over the next few weeks
[2927.34 → 2928.38] You'll hear us sharing stories
[2928.38 → 2929.44] Of how people practice
[2929.44 → 2930.58] These different things
[2930.58 → 2931.86] And how in and through them
[2931.86 → 2933.14] They discover the love
[2933.14 → 2933.66] Of the Father
[2933.66 → 2934.88] They hear him speaking
[2934.88 → 2935.74] To them through the scriptures
[2935.74 → 2937.24] They receive again
[2937.24 → 2937.80] And again
[2937.80 → 2938.42] And again
[2938.42 → 2939.02] The mercy
[2939.02 → 2939.78] And the grace
[2939.78 → 2940.58] Of Jesus
[2940.58 → 2942.54] They find life
[2942.54 → 2943.34] And power
[2943.34 → 2943.84] Through the work
[2943.84 → 2944.54] Of the Holy Spirit
[2944.54 → 2945.44] These practices
[2945.44 → 2946.52] Are tilling the soil
[2946.52 → 2947.54] So that we can be
[2947.54 → 2948.12] In communion
[2948.12 → 2949.38] With the Father
[2949.38 → 2950.78] That's how we're
[2950.78 → 2951.84] Created to live
[2951.84 → 2953.38] And this way of life
[2953.38 → 2954.36] These practices of Jesus
[2954.36 → 2955.80] Are means by which
[2955.80 → 2957.22] We enter into communion
[2957.22 → 2957.92] With the Father
[2957.92 → 2959.82] These practices
[2959.82 → 2961.32] Are a gift
[2961.32 → 2964.62] But to return
[2964.62 → 2965.78] To where I began
[2965.78 → 2968.20] These practices
[2968.20 → 2969.82] Are also counter-formational
[2969.82 → 2970.86] Remember the stream
[2970.86 → 2972.30] The powerful cultural narrative
[2972.30 → 2973.86] As we step into
[2973.86 → 2974.92] This way of life
[2974.92 → 2976.88] These practices of Jesus
[2976.88 → 2978.16] These spiritual disciplines
[2978.16 → 2980.22] We are able to stand
[2980.22 → 2981.18] By God's grace
[2981.18 → 2983.12] And swim in a different direction
[2983.12 → 2984.54] Jeremy Slim
[2984.54 → 2985.60] Who I quoted at the beginning
[2985.60 → 2986.50] Shares this
[2986.50 → 2987.08] And I can't find
[2987.08 → 2987.76] I don't know anyone
[2987.76 → 2988.88] Who says it better than Jeremy
[2988.88 → 2989.92] On how these practices
[2989.92 → 2991.12] Are counter-formation
[2991.12 → 2992.46] In a culture
[2992.46 → 2993.48] That does not form us
[2993.48 → 2994.18] In the way of Jesus
[2994.18 → 2994.80] He writes
[2994.80 → 2996.74] Fasting
[2996.74 → 2998.72] Is a weapon
[2998.72 → 3000.74] Against materialism
[3000.74 → 3002.26] Scripture
[3002.26 → 3003.48] The weapon
[3003.48 → 3004.98] Against personal autonomy
[3004.98 → 3006.62] Generosity
[3006.62 → 3007.42] The weapon
[3007.42 → 3008.42] Against greed

[3035.84 → 3037.00] In the kingdom of God

[3062.64 → 3064.00] To pick
[3064.00 → 3064.78] Them
[3064.78 → 3065.74] Up
[3065.74 → 3069.58] And so hope
[3069.58 → 3071.72] We have been
[3071.72 → 3072.16] Invited
[3072.16 → 3074.20] To discover

[3075.02 → 3075.56] Of the freedom
[3075.56 → 3076.78] We've already received

[3078.18 → 3080.32] As free people
[3080.32 → 3081.26] Through the work
[3081.26 → 3081.66] Of Jesus
[3081.66 → 3082.60] We now get to
[3082.60 → 3084.06] Unpack the gift

[3085.56 → 3087.06] And live
[3087.06 → 3087.78] Into the way
[3087.78 → 3088.60] That we are created
[3088.60 → 3089.54] To live from the beginning
[3089.54 → 3090.60] And will
[3090.60 → 3091.40] At the end
[3091.40 → 3093.22] As we adopt
[3093.22 → 3094.12] The habits
[3094.12 → 3095.36] And the practices
[3095.36 → 3096.60] That Jesus himself
[3096.60 → 3097.32] Gave us
[3097.32 → 3098.90] And don't be
[3098.90 → 3099.84] Surprised
[3099.84 → 3101.14] If as you seek
[3101.14 → 3101.98] To adopt them
[3101.98 → 3102.64] And build them
[3102.64 → 3103.34] Into your life
[3103.34 → 3104.42] You discover
[3104.42 → 3105.06] Again
[3105.06 → 3106.42] And again
[3106.42 → 3107.46] And again
[3107.46 → 3108.58] The love
[3108.58 → 3109.24] Of the Father
[3109.24 → 3111.04] The grace
[3111.04 → 3111.74] Of the Son
[3111.74 → 3113.24] And the power
[3113.24 → 3114.12] Of the Holy Spirit
[3114.12 → 3115.46] Let's pray
[3115.46 → 3121.32] Father we begin
[3121.32 → 3122.20] By thanking you
[3122.20 → 3123.52] For your grace
[3123.52 → 3125.66] We thank you
[3125.66 → 3126.20] For breaking
[3126.20 → 3127.16] Into our lives
[3127.16 → 3128.08] Through the work
[3128.08 → 3128.42] Of Jesus
[3128.42 → 3129.18] On the cross
[3129.18 → 3131.14] And liberating us
[3131.14 → 3132.34] From idols
[3132.34 → 3134.36] Thank you
[3134.36 → 3135.20] For your patience
[3135.20 → 3136.10] With us
[3136.10 → 3136.66] In our own
[3136.66 → 3137.34] Apprenticeship
[3137.34 → 3139.20] I know that many
[3139.20 → 3139.50] Of us
[3139.50 → 3139.94] When we think
[3139.94 → 3140.50] About where we're
[3140.50 → 3141.48] At in our life
[3141.48 → 3142.04] In Christ
[3142.04 → 3143.04] There's guilt
[3143.04 → 3145.22] And there's shame
[3145.22 → 3147.18] There's frustration
[3147.18 → 3149.80] A sense of loss
[3149.80 → 3151.98] And we pray Lord
[3151.98 → 3152.82] That we would recognize
[3152.82 → 3153.96] That you are a loving
[3153.96 → 3155.56] Patient Father
[3155.56 → 3156.94] You do not treat us
[3156.94 → 3158.06] As our sins deserve
[3158.06 → 3159.32] And that as far
[3159.32 → 3159.90] As the east
[3159.90 → 3160.58] Is from the west
[3160.58 → 3161.12] So far
[3161.12 → 3161.90] Have you removed
[3161.90 → 3162.92] Our transgressions
[3162.92 → 3163.46] From us
[3163.46 → 3165.62] We pray Lord
[3165.62 → 3166.62] That we would learn
[3166.62 → 3168.48] How to practice
[3168.48 → 3169.50] The way of the kingdom
[3169.50 → 3171.34] We pray that we
[3171.34 → 3171.90] Would pick up
[3171.90 → 3172.42] The tools
[3172.42 → 3173.42] That Jesus himself
[3173.42 → 3174.16] Gave us
[3174.16 → 3175.96] And learn to live
[3175.96 → 3176.56] In the freedom
[3176.56 → 3178.78] Lord we pray
[3178.78 → 3179.22] That you would
[3179.22 → 3180.34] Give us intentionality
[3180.34 → 3181.38] That your spirit
[3181.38 → 3182.42] Would empower us
[3182.42 → 3183.54] To make decisions
[3183.54 → 3184.98] And plot on our calendars
[3184.98 → 3186.42] Things that will bring life
[3186.42 → 3188.44] And we thank you, Lord
[3188.44 → 3189.54] That every step of the way
[3189.54 → 3190.06] In our lives
[3190.06 → 3191.26] You walk with us
[3191.26 → 3192.62] Amen
[3192.62 → 3195.60] I invite you to stand
[3195.60 → 3196.54] In your homes together
[3196.54 → 3197.24] And join me
[3197.24 → 3198.34] In our final song
[3198.34 → 3199.14] Of response
[3199.14 → 3201.86] We've heard the word
[3201.86 → 3202.38] Of the Lord
[3202.38 → 3203.92] And let's continue
[3203.92 → 3204.64] To work it out
[3204.64 → 3205.64] With fear and trembling
[3205.64 → 3207.12] And we can only do that
[3207.12 → 3207.92] With the power
[3207.92 → 3209.20] Of the spirit in us
[3209.20 → 3210.54] And only as we allow
[3210.54 → 3211.68] The spirit to work in us
[3211.68 → 3213.26] So let's sing this song
[3213.26 → 3214.06] As a prayer
[3214.06 → 3215.46] To ask the Holy Spirit
[3215.46 → 3216.20] To work in us
[3216.20 → 3217.24] And invite the Holy Spirit
[3217.24 → 3218.50] To change us
[3218.50 → 3238.08] Spirit of the living God
[3238.08 → 3242.70] Fall fresh on me

[3274.56 → 3275.56] Prove among us
[3275.56 → 3281.56] Prove among us all
[3281.56 → 3287.56] Make us one in heart and mind
[3287.56 → 3291.56] Make us one in love

[3330.44 → 3350.24] Fill us, send us, call before us. Spirit of the living God, make our lives a sign.
[3360.44 → 3370.82] Amen. As we go into our week as citizens of the kingdom of God, as apprentices of Jesus,
[3371.24 → 3377.56] I want you to receive this blessing that comes from 1 Thessalonians. May God himself, the God of
[3377.56 → 3385.52] peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at
[3385.52 → 3395.18] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it. Go in peace. Amen.
[3415.52 → 3416.52] Amen.
[3445.52 → 3446.52] Amen.
[3475.52 → 3476.52] Amen.
