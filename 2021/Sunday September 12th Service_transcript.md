[0.00 --> 5.28]  And I just want to say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[7.42 --> 12.26]  You are faithful God and you're always for me.
[13.84 --> 19.20]  And I just want to say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[21.64 --> 25.88]  All my praise is yours, I give you glory.
[30.00 --> 45.92]  Dear God, we are so blessed to be a part of a group of people who are part of your community, God.
[46.36 --> 52.68]  This is the Hope Community Church, the local chapter, but you have chosen us as your family.
[52.68 --> 54.64]  We are part of a big family.
[55.40 --> 57.88]  And we thank you, God, for your faithfulness to us.
[57.88 --> 64.10]  And we thank you for your love for us and for leading us by your example.
[65.26 --> 70.38]  The example of being a servant, of stepping up and stepping out to care for people.
[71.58 --> 78.06]  So we pray now your blessing on Pastor Dave as he brings your message to us.
[78.06 --> 87.94]  I pray, God, that we have humble, humble hearts and ears that are wide open to hear not just the words of Dave, but the words of you yourself, God.
[88.40 --> 90.00]  What is it that we need to hear today?
[90.08 --> 94.08]  I pray that we each would grow and be stretched and learn.
[95.22 --> 97.46]  Dear Lord, thank you for your servant, Dave.
[98.04 --> 99.00]  Bless him this morning.
[99.34 --> 99.52]  Amen.
[99.52 --> 99.66]  Amen.
[99.66 --> 99.70]  Amen.
[99.70 --> 99.72]  Amen.
[99.72 --> 99.74]  Amen.
[99.74 --> 99.78]  Amen.
[108.06 --> 123.96]  Sorry about that.
[124.90 --> 125.88]  Well, good morning, everyone.
[126.02 --> 129.34]  It's a gift to spend time gathering around God's Word this morning.
[129.34 --> 132.80]  If you're new to our church, my name is Dave Gruen.
[132.88 --> 133.88]  I'm one of the pastors here.
[134.46 --> 137.48]  And it's a gift to be in worship together, as Val already underscored.
[138.20 --> 138.88]  It's a new season.
[139.28 --> 140.38]  We have a ministry fair.
[140.56 --> 142.70]  A lot of new ministries are kicking off today.
[143.22 --> 146.92]  In fact, all the people wearing the blue shirts, if you hadn't heard that, they are all people leading ministries.
[147.04 --> 148.40]  And you get to chat with them after the service.
[149.02 --> 152.04]  But we're also starting a new sermon series this morning on servanthood.
[152.04 --> 163.50]  And Pastor Sid and I thought it would be a fitting season to talk and reflect and spend time on what it means to be kingdom servants in your homes, your marriages, your workplaces, our church family, and in our city.
[163.90 --> 166.38]  So we're going to walk slowly through what it means to be a servant.
[166.48 --> 168.70]  We're going to reflect deeply on what the scriptures teach us about it.
[168.72 --> 175.38]  And we're going to start in what I think is the perfect starting place, and that is looking at how Jesus, our King, models his servanthood.
[175.38 --> 177.58]  So if you have your Bible, turn with me to John 13.
[177.58 --> 183.72]  If you have it on your phone, you can scroll to John 13, but we're going to read the story of Jesus washing his disciples' feet.
[192.78 --> 195.26]  It was just before the Passover festival.
[196.38 --> 200.14]  Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father.
[201.26 --> 204.94]  Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
[204.94 --> 211.66]  The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.
[212.66 --> 218.70]  Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God.
[219.14 --> 225.64]  So he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
[226.58 --> 234.12]  After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
[234.94 --> 239.14]  He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, Lord, are you going to wash my feet?
[240.16 --> 245.78]  Jesus replied, you do not know what I am doing, but later you will understand.
[246.78 --> 249.56]  No, said Peter, you shall never wash my feet.
[250.64 --> 254.26]  Jesus answered, unless I wash you, you have no part with me.
[255.22 --> 259.12]  Then Lord, Simon Peter replied, not just my feet, but my hands and my head as well.
[259.12 --> 264.80]  Jesus answered, those who have a bath need only to wash their feet, their whole body is clean.
[265.34 --> 267.78]  And you are clean, though not every one of you.
[268.32 --> 272.18]  For he knew who was going to betray him and why he said not everyone was clean.
[273.54 --> 277.68]  When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place.
[278.64 --> 281.34]  Do you understand what I have done for you?
[281.38 --> 282.00]  He asked them.
[282.00 --> 286.88]  You call me teacher and Lord, and rightly so, for that is what I am.
[287.80 --> 292.92]  Now that I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you should also wash one another's feet.
[293.62 --> 296.70]  I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.
[297.26 --> 304.30]  Very truly, I tell you, servants are not greater than their masters, nor are messengers greater than the one who sent them.
[304.30 --> 309.88]  Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.
[315.16 --> 318.24]  Well, a number of years ago, I read a quote about power.
[318.86 --> 321.68]  I have a feeling some of you have heard before, and the quote goes like this.
[322.74 --> 323.98]  Power corrupts.
[325.18 --> 327.44]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[328.30 --> 329.10]  Have you heard that before?
[329.76 --> 330.30]  A few of you?
[330.30 --> 336.42]  That was coined, at least people think it was coined by a guy named Lord Acton in 1887.
[337.26 --> 341.06]  And Lord Acton, as he looked around, especially at political leaders of his day,
[341.48 --> 344.40]  he was concerned that as these political leaders gained more power,
[344.80 --> 349.48]  they started using that power for their own benefit at the expense of those below them.
[350.50 --> 353.68]  In fact, he believed that the more power and authority people got,
[354.30 --> 356.46]  the more corrupt they would become.
[356.46 --> 361.20]  That they would have an increased temptation to use all that they have, the platform that they have,
[361.24 --> 364.22]  the authority that they have against others for the sake of themselves.
[366.08 --> 369.16]  Now, I don't know this for sure, but I think if Lord Acton lived today,
[370.18 --> 372.22]  he would probably still stand by that statement, don't you think?
[373.02 --> 373.92]  Power corrupts.
[374.12 --> 377.38]  Maybe if we gave him a phone, he scrolled through social media, watched what we watch on TV.
[377.62 --> 381.22]  I think he'd still stand by that statement, that power corrupts.
[381.22 --> 385.12]  I mean, just think of all that happened in the last few weeks and months.
[385.92 --> 388.74]  Stories of politicians using their power for their own benefit.
[388.90 --> 393.84]  In fact, critics of these elections would say that these elections themselves are an exercise in what?
[394.36 --> 395.26]  More power.
[396.86 --> 404.12]  Or business executives finding creative ways to use the laws, use their policies to gain wealth.
[404.12 --> 409.52]  Think of the armies of lawyers that work for big tech companies that are finding loopholes to take your data,
[410.06 --> 412.20]  your privacy, and monetize it.
[412.40 --> 414.26]  If you don't know that, you should probably look into that.
[415.16 --> 415.98]  Look at Greg Gerber.
[416.08 --> 418.24]  He looks into the privacy for our church.
[419.38 --> 422.58]  Or think of pop stars as celebrities who feel invincible
[422.58 --> 428.06]  and that they are entitled to do whatever they want because they are at this level of power and authority.
[428.70 --> 430.34]  And let's not leave churches out of it.
[430.34 --> 435.32]  There are many churches and pastors that abuse power.
[436.22 --> 438.32]  In fact, this summer I read a book on power in the church.
[438.44 --> 440.14]  It was a sobering read for the summer.
[440.62 --> 444.82]  But at the beginning of the book just told story after story after story of pastors,
[445.54 --> 450.20]  influential, competent, articulate young pastors who built up mega churches, multi-site churches.
[450.46 --> 452.26]  They had all sorts of things going on.
[452.38 --> 459.16]  But then everything exploded because of abuse of power, scandals, financial corruption,
[459.16 --> 462.38]  Lord Acton was on to something when he said,
[462.70 --> 463.54]  Power corrupts.
[464.00 --> 466.44]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[467.08 --> 472.80]  It messes with these deep longings we have for authority and control as humans.
[474.68 --> 481.92]  And now we get to John 13, which I think is a profoundly challenging and profoundly subversive passage.
[482.04 --> 484.30]  I think if we're honest, we actually don't like this passage.
[484.80 --> 488.22]  We don't like what it tells us our lives should look like.
[488.22 --> 490.92]  This is a challenging, subversive passage.
[491.06 --> 495.56]  It takes power and it flips on its head what we think power should be like.
[496.30 --> 501.68]  It takes our Western ambition for upward mobility and flips it on its head.
[502.00 --> 507.84]  And I think it takes our view of God and it flips it on its head.
[507.84 --> 514.96]  And so this morning, it's my privilege to lead us through this challenging, subversive, and beautiful passage
[514.96 --> 518.58]  of a king who wipes muck off of people's feet.
[520.12 --> 521.40]  So let's take a look at this passage.
[521.50 --> 522.66]  If you're a Bible, look at it with me.
[523.38 --> 526.68]  You'll see that the very beginning of this passage, it actually gives us the big picture.
[527.40 --> 529.40]  It says that Jesus knows where he's going.
[529.46 --> 530.08]  I'll just read it for you.
[530.08 --> 534.48]  It says, Jesus, knowing that the hour had come for him to leave this world and was going back
[534.48 --> 535.36]  to be with the Father.
[535.50 --> 539.88]  And you should know that this passage, as John writes it, he wants us to know that Jesus
[539.88 --> 541.36]  is aware of what's happening.
[541.90 --> 543.80]  He's not oblivious to the circumstances around him.
[543.82 --> 546.86]  He knows that his own disciple, Judas, will betray him.
[546.96 --> 547.50]  He'll be arrested.
[547.64 --> 548.66]  He'll be beaten, flogged.
[548.86 --> 552.06]  He'll be sentenced to a crucifixion, the most horrific of Roman death.
[552.06 --> 557.72]  But he also knows that he's rising from the dead and he's returning to his Father.
[558.72 --> 560.58]  But Jesus is aware of the limited calendar.
[560.72 --> 562.08]  He's got less days on the calendar.
[562.16 --> 564.70]  In fact, it's just a few short hours before he's going to be betrayed.
[565.16 --> 571.48]  And in that limited time, think about this, Jesus is on the ground and he's wiping feet.
[572.94 --> 574.50]  Think for a moment what Jesus could be doing.
[574.90 --> 578.10]  Could be teaching, could be having the crowds in front of him, could be doing healing, making
[578.10 --> 581.56]  sure more and more people saw the power of the kingdom that he was establishing.
[581.56 --> 587.68]  But here he was with 12 people in the upper room, bending down, wiping their feet.
[588.58 --> 590.32]  What a powerful image of Jesus.
[591.48 --> 592.42]  But it goes further than that.
[592.48 --> 595.60]  I want you to see this morning what else Jesus knows.
[595.70 --> 601.42]  We read in verse 3, Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power.
[602.08 --> 604.22]  He knew he's coming from God, he's going back to God.
[604.26 --> 608.86]  And even as he lived in his earthly ministry, Jesus knew that all things were under his power.
[608.86 --> 615.26]  It's not just true, staggering though this is, that all things are under Jesus' power.
[616.12 --> 619.76]  It's not just significant that Jesus knows he's the ruler of the kings of the earth and
[619.76 --> 620.94]  all the armies, all the rulers.
[621.30 --> 623.54]  It's that he's aware of it, right?
[623.54 --> 630.22]  In my opinion, I could be wrong in this, I think the moment that leaders become dangerous
[630.22 --> 633.54]  is often when they realize how much power they have.
[634.48 --> 638.56]  It's one thing to be a person of influence, it's another thing to know how much influence
[638.56 --> 639.26]  you have.
[639.76 --> 644.68]  And that often is the turning point where things start turning inward, where corrupt desires
[644.68 --> 649.56]  start twisting how you live, what you do, who you spend your time with, what your influence
[649.56 --> 650.02]  will be.
[650.74 --> 654.18]  And Jesus, knowing that all things were under his authority, that all power had been given
[654.18 --> 656.06]  to him, what's he doing with his authority?
[657.10 --> 663.40]  He grabs a basin of water, he grabs his garment, and he starts scraping muck and probably excrement
[663.40 --> 665.36]  and dirt off of feet.
[667.32 --> 667.72]  Wow.
[669.54 --> 676.50]  But before we look even closer at this act of selfless love, I want us to see Jesus' character.
[676.50 --> 679.20]  This is not just an object lesson.
[679.26 --> 683.94]  I want you to hear again what we read in verse 1, having loved his own who are in the world,
[684.48 --> 686.42]  he loved them to the end.
[687.80 --> 691.72]  Jesus wasn't just interested in them knowing things or seeing how he's living.
[692.00 --> 694.56]  He's not just doing this as an object lesson where they need to see something.
[694.64 --> 697.02]  He wants them to know that he loves them.
[697.68 --> 701.44]  Even if this passage wasn't recorded, Jesus does this whole foot washing thing because
[701.44 --> 703.36]  he loves his disciples.
[703.36 --> 707.98]  And that phrase, love them to the end, I'm not going to geek out on you with the Greek,
[708.56 --> 711.66]  but to the end has a sort of double meaning to it, the sense of that he loves them fully
[711.66 --> 714.18]  and completely to the nth degree, so to speak.
[714.60 --> 719.56]  But to the end is to the cross, to the place where Jesus declares over his world, it's finished.
[720.58 --> 725.44]  I loved to the end, to the fullest measure for my world and for my people.
[725.44 --> 731.64]  And maybe it's worth pointing out too that these disciples that he loves are a complicated
[731.64 --> 732.10]  bunch.
[732.72 --> 735.46]  In fact, if you read Luke's account of the upper room, by the way, they're in the upper
[735.46 --> 737.92]  room, sort of the last supper scene if you can imagine it.
[738.28 --> 742.52]  Often we picture it as a sort of serene, quiet, contemplative scene where Jesus is teaching
[742.52 --> 744.34]  them, it's coming to the end of his life.
[744.46 --> 747.16]  But you know how Luke describes what's happening in this upper room?
[748.14 --> 749.44]  There's a fight going on.
[749.58 --> 750.12]  Did you know that?
[750.80 --> 752.30]  There's conflict between the disciples.
[752.30 --> 753.52]  Do you know what the conflict's about?
[754.44 --> 755.48]  It's about power.
[756.08 --> 760.40]  They're arguing over who should have a more elevated status in Jesus' kingdom.
[760.64 --> 762.24]  Can you imagine Jesus listening to this?
[762.72 --> 765.26]  They're saying, actually, can I be your chief supervisor, Jesus?
[765.36 --> 768.10]  Can I have an esteemed position in your kingdom, Jesus?
[768.30 --> 772.96]  And Jesus is going to blow their minds in just a few minutes when he says, you want to
[772.96 --> 773.64]  learn about power?
[774.54 --> 777.04]  You want to learn about authority, about your esteemed positions?
[778.04 --> 779.74]  Bull and towel.
[782.30 --> 789.38]  And in light of Jesus knowing who he is, knowing the authority that he has, we then read what
[789.38 --> 789.72]  he does.
[789.80 --> 790.94]  So he got up from the meal.
[791.64 --> 792.74]  He took off his outer clothing.
[792.88 --> 794.44]  He wrapped a towel around his waist.
[794.98 --> 798.38]  After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet.
[798.46 --> 799.26]  Can you picture this?
[799.96 --> 802.70]  Drawing them with a towel that was wrapped around him.
[802.70 --> 808.90]  Now, you've heard me say at Hope before that we believe Jesus is the fullest revelation
[808.90 --> 809.48]  of God.
[810.20 --> 814.94]  That is to say, when we see Jesus, we see the clearest picture of God that we have.
[815.84 --> 819.06]  And so we can rightly say, when we read this passage of what Jesus is doing, we can say,
[819.28 --> 821.14]  that's what God's like.
[821.14 --> 824.58]  That's how God uses power.
[825.22 --> 828.92]  That's how God takes all the authority that he put under Jesus and he wields it.
[828.98 --> 830.72]  Not to make himself look higher than the disciples.
[831.06 --> 833.04]  Not to exercise an unhealthy power over them.
[833.30 --> 838.58]  He stoops down with a garment and a bull and he scrapes the mud off of feet.
[839.48 --> 841.18]  Welcome to the upside down kingdom.
[841.18 --> 848.60]  Welcome to the Jesus way of power and authority and leadership where the kings bow down low
[848.60 --> 853.10]  and the rulers scrape off mud of the feet of people around.
[855.66 --> 859.60]  Now, many writers, when they look at this passage, they notice how weird it is.
[859.66 --> 861.38]  This is not how things are supposed to go.
[861.92 --> 865.20]  It's very common for people to have their feet washed as they go to people's houses for
[865.20 --> 866.30]  meals, but not like this.
[866.76 --> 870.36]  How it's supposed to happen is you go to a home and right at the door, there's the bull
[870.36 --> 870.86]  and basin.
[871.40 --> 873.72]  And the host isn't the one who does the foot washing.
[874.16 --> 878.82]  It's the person, the slave at the door, who's going to bend down as a routine act of hospitality,
[879.26 --> 881.82]  clean the feet, and then they go and enjoy the meal with the host.
[882.48 --> 883.46]  Here, it's all backwards.
[884.12 --> 888.44]  Jesus, in the middle of the meal, Jesus, in the middle of their conversation, he then takes
[888.44 --> 890.34]  the bull and basin and he is the host.
[891.10 --> 894.04]  The person of authority is now scraping the mud off their feet.
[894.44 --> 895.72]  This is not how it's supposed to go.
[895.78 --> 897.64]  And this weirded out the disciples.
[897.64 --> 899.64]  It confused the disciples.
[900.36 --> 903.68]  In fact, you can see there's a resistance to the disciples.
[904.74 --> 908.78]  And Peter, you know, the bold one, the vocal one of the bunch, he looks at Jesus getting
[908.78 --> 909.66]  ready to wipe his feet.
[909.70 --> 911.22]  He's like, no way, Jesus.
[911.70 --> 913.42]  I'm not letting you wipe my feet.
[913.50 --> 914.56]  This isn't how it works.
[915.42 --> 919.78]  And Peter, culturally speaking, is doing exactly what he should be doing.
[920.62 --> 922.34]  He's doing exactly what he should be doing.
[922.40 --> 923.24]  He's like, this is our teacher.
[923.36 --> 923.94]  This is our Lord.
[924.02 --> 924.74]  This is our rabbi.
[924.92 --> 926.86]  He's in a esteemed position of authority.
[926.86 --> 928.20]  We are his disciples.
[928.40 --> 931.94]  This guy isn't allowed to scrape the mud off of our feet.
[932.02 --> 932.84]  It's degrading.
[932.96 --> 933.78]  It's humiliating.
[933.88 --> 934.54]  It's debasing.
[934.82 --> 935.58]  No way, Jesus.
[935.84 --> 936.64]  Not happening.
[939.16 --> 941.24]  I want to read a quote for you that comes from Dale Bruner.
[941.32 --> 943.76]  Probably my favorite quote that I read this week.
[943.76 --> 946.06]  And here's what he writes.
[946.06 --> 952.48]  He says, there is no parallel in any existing ancient literature for a person of superior
[952.48 --> 957.26]  status voluntarily washing the feet of someone of inferior status.
[957.68 --> 958.34]  Did you hear that?
[958.66 --> 961.60]  There's nothing in ancient literature that compares to this event.
[963.06 --> 967.54]  Jesus' act, therefore, represents an assault on the usual notions of social hierarchy and
[967.54 --> 970.44]  subverts the normal categories of honor and shame.
[970.44 --> 974.12]  It's not just an honored teacher who's performing a shameful act.
[974.58 --> 975.72]  I love this next part.
[976.36 --> 983.70]  But a divine figure with sovereignty over the cosmos who has taken on the role of a slave.
[986.04 --> 989.54]  Let that shape your imagination of Jesus.
[991.36 --> 993.08]  Jesus is not like other kings.
[993.22 --> 994.24]  He's not like other world leaders.
[994.36 --> 996.64]  He's not like our politicians today.
[996.82 --> 998.54]  In fact, just try to imagine this.
[998.54 --> 1001.96]  Imagine any one of the people in the election debates.
[1002.04 --> 1003.34]  Did anyone watch the debates this week?
[1004.24 --> 1004.94]  One person?
[1005.04 --> 1005.44]  Wow, okay.
[1006.00 --> 1007.08]  We're an unpatriotic bunch.
[1007.18 --> 1007.78]  Okay, three people.
[1008.14 --> 1008.78]  No judgment.
[1008.88 --> 1009.30]  It's fine.
[1010.94 --> 1013.64]  But could you imagine any one of them stooping down and washing feet?
[1013.70 --> 1015.08]  Even clean feet, right?
[1015.12 --> 1016.96]  Could you imagine them taking off their expensive watches?
[1017.08 --> 1018.10]  I don't know if you've been following that.
[1018.40 --> 1020.26]  One of their watches is worth like 35 grand.
[1020.62 --> 1024.64]  You know, taking off the watch, bowing down, and actually washing feet.
[1024.64 --> 1030.24]  Could you imagine politicians doing that as they leverage for power, make promises they're
[1030.24 --> 1033.24]  not even sure they can keep, trying to find more power?
[1034.02 --> 1035.42]  I have a hard time imagining that.
[1036.16 --> 1040.28]  I mean, to be honest, I think a lot of us Christians have a hard time imagining washing
[1040.28 --> 1040.60]  feet.
[1041.30 --> 1044.92]  And this is no judgment on our church, but a few years ago I suggested for a Maundy Thursday
[1044.92 --> 1046.20]  service that we do a foot washing.
[1046.58 --> 1049.14]  And someone said to me very gently, I don't know, Dave.
[1049.14 --> 1050.86]  I'm not sure if our church is ready for that.
[1052.04 --> 1053.60]  Foot washing is a pretty serious deal.
[1054.70 --> 1057.44]  Lowering yourself in this kind of way is a pretty serious deal.
[1058.48 --> 1060.78]  And that's what Jesus, our King, does.
[1061.66 --> 1066.58]  And he wants his disciples to see in such a clear way, this is what it means to be a
[1066.58 --> 1067.42]  king in the kingdom.
[1068.42 --> 1072.98]  And this is what it means to be a disciple of that king in the kingdom.
[1073.60 --> 1076.58]  You live with that upside-down paradigm for power.
[1076.58 --> 1082.14]  That upside-down paradigm for how to live in this world that is broken, violent, and
[1082.14 --> 1082.72]  not right.
[1086.36 --> 1090.72]  Before we see how this is an example, I want us to see some of the deeper stuff of this
[1090.72 --> 1091.04]  passage.
[1091.14 --> 1092.90]  I find it's easy to race over this dimension.
[1093.20 --> 1097.52]  In the dialogue that Jesus has with Peter, we realize there's more happening in the story
[1097.52 --> 1099.92]  than just an act of service, although that's true.
[1100.48 --> 1104.34]  And when Jesus says to Peter, and this is a striking statement, he says, unless I wash you,
[1104.34 --> 1108.76]  Peter, you can have no part with me, right?
[1108.82 --> 1109.90]  Unless I wash you.
[1110.58 --> 1112.40]  And we're realizing he's pointing to something more here.
[1112.48 --> 1115.50]  It's no longer just about stooping down with the water and a basin.
[1115.62 --> 1118.22]  It's actually now about Jesus stooping down in a deeper way.
[1119.08 --> 1121.16]  Jesus stooping down in a different way.
[1121.28 --> 1126.20]  And of course, in just a few days, the towel and the basin are going to become the wood and
[1126.20 --> 1126.62]  the nails.
[1126.62 --> 1133.04]  And Jesus will stoop as low as he could possibly go, the most degrading death he can possibly
[1133.04 --> 1139.64]  take on for the sake of cleansing and washing his world and cleansing his people.
[1140.28 --> 1143.24]  It shouldn't surprise any of us that when you read the New Testament writers, they talk
[1143.24 --> 1149.42]  about the death and resurrection of Jesus as our cleansing, as being washed, because the
[1149.42 --> 1153.00]  death of Jesus is the event by which we are cleansed.
[1153.00 --> 1158.94]  And so Jesus confronts Peter and he says, Peter, will you let me wash you?
[1159.54 --> 1162.36]  And I actually happen to think that's one of the central questions of this whole passage
[1162.36 --> 1163.14]  that we need to ask.
[1163.54 --> 1167.12]  Will we let Jesus wash us?
[1167.90 --> 1174.02]  Will we have the humility to let King Jesus with all authority cleanse us?
[1175.12 --> 1177.10]  And I brought a bit of an object lesson today.
[1177.60 --> 1179.10]  I don't do that very often.
[1179.22 --> 1180.58]  I don't even use PowerPoint very often.
[1180.58 --> 1185.56]  This is a gift from my father-in-law when I was ordained, kind of just a few months ago
[1185.56 --> 1187.02]  when we had our ordination service here.
[1187.64 --> 1190.88]  And it's a wooden art, of course, of Jesus washing Peter's feet.
[1191.42 --> 1195.04]  And it's beautiful in many ways, but I think my favorite part of this, and you can come
[1195.04 --> 1196.54]  up afterwards to take a look at it.
[1196.58 --> 1200.06]  In fact, a nine-year-old boy after the first service came up and spent a lot of time looking
[1200.06 --> 1200.38]  at this.
[1200.38 --> 1204.40]  But my favorite part is Peter's face and his hands.
[1205.22 --> 1212.22]  And I can't tell if there's a sense of acceptance or subtle resistance to Jesus washing his feet.
[1212.76 --> 1214.16]  And I happen to think it's the latter.
[1214.24 --> 1217.38]  I think Peter is struggling to let Jesus wash him.
[1217.44 --> 1221.02]  I think Peter is trying to figure out what's going on with this king who's now washing his
[1221.02 --> 1222.46]  feet and what this means for his life.
[1222.46 --> 1225.22]  And I feel like this is a posture of so many of us.
[1225.86 --> 1230.22]  And what's required for every Christian, what's required for everyone who comes to faith and
[1230.22 --> 1234.60]  believes in him, in Jesus, is the humility to let him cleanse us.
[1235.34 --> 1238.86]  To welcome his redeeming work that we don't deserve.
[1239.72 --> 1243.94]  We're too proud to even recognize how much we need is to actually say, I received that
[1243.94 --> 1246.70]  cleansing work in order to be in fellowship with this king.
[1246.70 --> 1255.66]  And if I have the logic right of this passage, it's the cleansing and the receiving of that
[1255.66 --> 1259.74]  that allows us to be the servants who wash the feet of the world.
[1259.86 --> 1263.18]  And I want to read for you how Jesus finishes this dialogue with his disciples.
[1263.98 --> 1268.62]  He says in verse 13 to 17, you call me teacher and Lord, and rightly so, for he is.
[1268.66 --> 1269.50]  That's what Jesus is.
[1269.96 --> 1274.98]  Now that I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's
[1274.98 --> 1275.20]  feet.
[1275.20 --> 1279.08]  I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.
[1279.82 --> 1283.46]  Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater
[1283.46 --> 1284.60]  than the one who sent him.
[1284.86 --> 1289.50]  And now that you know these things, you'll be blessed if you do them.
[1294.16 --> 1295.36]  The logic is simple.
[1296.20 --> 1301.06]  The cleansing work of Jesus, receiving that humility, allowing him to wash us, leads to
[1301.06 --> 1308.40]  a posture by the Holy Spirit, whereby the church then lives in the ongoing posture of kneeling
[1308.40 --> 1314.02]  love, where the church actually washes the feet of the world.
[1314.02 --> 1317.70]  That's what Jesus is inviting every disciple into.
[1318.40 --> 1322.16]  That's what he's commanding his disciples to be as he sends them out into the world, not
[1322.16 --> 1327.10]  with power to wield over people, not with authority to smack other people down with, but to wipe
[1327.10 --> 1331.26]  the dirt off the feet of our world in myriads of ways.
[1331.26 --> 1337.72]  This is a basic point worthy of repeating, but hope, you and I, each one of us, was created
[1337.72 --> 1338.34]  to serve.
[1340.00 --> 1344.22]  With all the talent, all the gifts, all the energy, all the intellect, all the strength
[1344.22 --> 1349.52]  that you have, God designed it such that you serve the world with those gifts.
[1349.52 --> 1351.64]  They are not just for you.
[1352.66 --> 1356.16]  They're so that you can live in a posture of kneeling love with all that you have and
[1356.16 --> 1359.20]  all that God has so generously poured out into our lives.
[1359.46 --> 1360.16]  Do you know that?
[1361.34 --> 1365.58]  And the sinfulness of your and the sinfulness of my heart and the cultural narrative in which
[1365.58 --> 1369.36]  we live will always push against that creation design.
[1370.34 --> 1372.44]  We always seem to want to elevate ourselves.
[1372.54 --> 1373.80]  We want the upward mobility.
[1374.08 --> 1374.80]  Can we name that?
[1374.80 --> 1380.06]  We want to enjoy all the privileges of the power that we have in our society and the hard
[1380.06 --> 1381.32]  work we do in our jobs.
[1382.06 --> 1383.30]  And Jesus says, that's not my kingdom.
[1384.54 --> 1386.14]  My kingdom is downward mobility.
[1386.76 --> 1390.26]  It's taking whatever power God has generously given you, whatever authority he's generously
[1390.26 --> 1394.54]  giving you, whatever influence he's given you in your short life that you live, to pour
[1394.54 --> 1397.22]  out, to wash the feet of the world.
[1397.40 --> 1398.14]  Do you know that?
[1399.86 --> 1401.64]  That's what it means to be his disciples.
[1402.20 --> 1404.78]  That's what Jesus clearly says in verses 13 to 17.
[1404.80 --> 1405.68]  of this passage.
[1405.76 --> 1407.14]  I told you, we might not like this.
[1407.80 --> 1411.76]  Because it's so much easier for us to just worry about ourselves, to concern ourselves
[1411.76 --> 1417.62]  with ourselves, to live life for ourselves and miss out on what Jesus calls us to be.
[1422.84 --> 1425.28]  Now, I want to talk a little bit about practical ways this happens.
[1426.36 --> 1429.12]  I think when you talk about foot washing, we're like, okay, well, what does it mean to wash
[1429.12 --> 1429.60]  people's feet?
[1429.64 --> 1432.94]  I think I'd creep a lot of people out if I just went to work and I started washing my co-workers'
[1433.10 --> 1433.28]  feet.
[1433.28 --> 1436.00]  Foot washing takes a lot of different shapes.
[1437.04 --> 1441.38]  It takes the shape of cutting the grass for your neighbor who is elderly and can't move.
[1442.70 --> 1446.62]  Foot washing takes the shape of sharing a meal with someone who's new to your neighborhood,
[1446.80 --> 1450.14]  whose English is not as great as yours, who's still trying to understand the culture and
[1450.14 --> 1452.88]  breaking bread with them, showing hospitality to them.
[1453.84 --> 1459.42]  Foot washing could take the shape of learning sign language so that you can communicate with
[1459.42 --> 1461.32]  the little girl in your class who's non-verbal.
[1462.64 --> 1466.90]  Foot washing takes the shape of sharing meals with people who are struggling and lonely.
[1467.60 --> 1473.16]  It takes the shape of listening to the person with whom you're in conflict with, perhaps over
[1473.16 --> 1474.14]  COVID vaccinations.
[1475.10 --> 1475.60]  Too soon?
[1476.18 --> 1476.82]  Okay, too soon.
[1477.14 --> 1477.60]  Too soon.
[1477.60 --> 1483.04]  And perhaps it's even a person in your family who disagrees with you over COVID vaccinations.
[1483.74 --> 1488.90]  This is all one way in which you live in the posture of kneeling love.
[1488.90 --> 1492.92]  I want to just give you one example that I heard about recently.
[1492.98 --> 1494.90]  In fact, I read about it recently with our surge group.
[1495.02 --> 1496.16]  There's a young woman named Tina.
[1497.08 --> 1500.36]  Tina's a bartender at a fairly popular establishment.
[1501.02 --> 1504.24]  And she's also a believer, which means she's a reformed Christian, right?
[1505.06 --> 1506.52]  Only reformed people work at bars.
[1507.36 --> 1510.12]  But Tina, she worked with a number of people on staff.
[1510.20 --> 1513.64]  And there's this one young man who she worked with going through a very difficult time trying
[1513.64 --> 1514.60]  to find his way through life.
[1515.08 --> 1518.36]  And he called her and he let her know that his girlfriend just died.
[1519.34 --> 1520.30]  And that he wasn't coming to work.
[1520.36 --> 1522.40]  And he was nervous because he knew that shifts were tight.
[1522.50 --> 1525.80]  He knew there's a lot of complexity around whether he'll keep his job if he misses shifts.
[1526.10 --> 1530.30]  And Tina said, in an instant, I will cover your shifts as long as you need.
[1530.82 --> 1531.68]  I'll cover your shifts.
[1531.98 --> 1532.92]  I'll do what needs to be done.
[1533.22 --> 1533.72]  You grieve.
[1533.82 --> 1534.62]  You be present to the family.
[1534.70 --> 1535.56]  You do what you need to do.
[1535.74 --> 1537.96]  This happened for weeks where Tina came in.
[1538.38 --> 1541.46]  And for a while there, she was double shifting, doing her shift and his shift.
[1541.66 --> 1543.38]  And sometimes she was just doing his shift.
[1544.00 --> 1546.84]  And Tina herself, by the way, she was a young stage in life.
[1546.92 --> 1548.88]  Her husband was in med school and she was struggling financially.
[1549.92 --> 1555.04]  When this young man came back after several weeks of grief and pain, he noticed that not
[1555.04 --> 1560.20]  only did she cover all of his shifts, but every time she punched in, she punched in as him.
[1561.36 --> 1564.26]  And that every single hour she worked went towards his paycheck.
[1565.18 --> 1567.64]  And it blew his mind.
[1569.20 --> 1573.16]  And I have no idea how he felt about the gospel or Christianity or what Tina believed.
[1573.16 --> 1580.08]  But I know for certain he got a small taste of the kneeling love of disciples.
[1580.80 --> 1585.12]  He experienced in his own way Tina washing his feet.
[1585.52 --> 1586.76]  And it's beautiful.
[1586.76 --> 1590.12]  What does that look like for you?
[1590.12 --> 1596.52]  What's percolating in your imagination about whose feet you could wash?
[1597.52 --> 1606.10]  Coworkers, family members, friends, enemies, neighbors, people who live in our city.
[1606.10 --> 1609.10]  Who's coming to mind?
[1609.90 --> 1610.92]  I want to read for you a quote.
[1611.00 --> 1612.50]  This actually comes from Andy Crouch.
[1613.36 --> 1616.04]  He wrote an article a little while ago on a whole variety of things.
[1616.18 --> 1619.56]  But as I read this quote, it just resonated in deep places with me.
[1619.62 --> 1620.40]  And this is what he writes.
[1620.46 --> 1620.76]  He says,
[1620.76 --> 1629.26]  The most transformative acts of our lives are likely to be the moments when we radically empty ourselves.
[1630.18 --> 1634.84]  In the very settings where we would normally be expected to exercise authority.
[1634.92 --> 1635.74]  You catching the drift there?
[1636.48 --> 1642.28]  The moment where you literally just give of yourself and you pour out benevolence when people would expect otherwise.
[1642.48 --> 1647.92]  Perhaps they would expect you to show your authority in a typical Western way and instead you serve.
[1647.92 --> 1652.90]  Perhaps they expect you to elevate your status and in fact what you do is use that to bless.
[1654.08 --> 1654.48]  And he says,
[1654.72 --> 1657.86]  Those are often the most transformative moments of our lives.
[1658.48 --> 1659.74]  And I bet you you've tasted it.
[1660.68 --> 1665.20]  I bet you if you think back on your own life, you'll realize that's the moments that you served.
[1665.96 --> 1667.18]  Perhaps sacrificially.
[1667.88 --> 1669.56]  Perhaps in ways you didn't think you were capable of.
[1669.82 --> 1673.76]  Those were the moments we realized this is discipleship.
[1674.24 --> 1676.16]  This is how we were created to live.
[1676.16 --> 1681.26]  In kneeling love that washes the feet of the world.
[1683.12 --> 1684.56]  What does that look like for you?
[1685.80 --> 1690.20]  If I could dictate how you should have your lunch today or have conversation in the foyer after the service.
[1690.68 --> 1691.56]  Talk about that.
[1692.18 --> 1693.28]  Talk about who's coming to mind.
[1693.36 --> 1694.50]  The situations that are coming to mind.
[1694.78 --> 1700.68]  Talk about just what comes to your mind first when you think this is how I can wash the feet of my neighbors.
[1700.68 --> 1701.08]  My coworkers.
[1701.48 --> 1702.24]  My coworkers.
[1702.84 --> 1703.66]  My friends.
[1704.02 --> 1706.22]  My brothers and sisters in the church.
[1708.22 --> 1711.70]  Could you imagine if the church was known for this?
[1712.22 --> 1717.66]  Could you imagine that John 13 was actually a really helpful description of what people see in the church?
[1718.46 --> 1721.26]  You know, one of the lamentable realities, if I can name this, of the church right now,
[1721.26 --> 1726.68]  is it's known a whole lot more for protesting, for naysaying, than it is for service.
[1728.76 --> 1732.10]  And the way I see the churches in the news often breaks my heart.
[1733.12 --> 1735.52]  Could you imagine if when people thought of Hope Community Church,
[1735.60 --> 1741.18]  that's the church where those people will get their hands dirty caring for the needs of the city.
[1741.18 --> 1746.64]  We can call that church because we know they're going to say yes to the problems and the challenges and the needs in our city
[1746.64 --> 1751.84]  because this is a community of people that gives their lives away in kneeling love.
[1752.52 --> 1753.68]  Could you imagine that?
[1754.14 --> 1756.02]  Oh, man, that makes me want to be part of my church.
[1757.34 --> 1759.04]  Doesn't it make you want to be part of the church?
[1759.96 --> 1764.24]  Known as a reputation in the city for kneeling sacrificial love.
[1765.16 --> 1766.60]  For scraping the muck off the feet.
[1766.60 --> 1769.92]  Whatever that muck is, whosever life that is.
[1772.14 --> 1775.52]  Let me finish by talking for a few minutes about this ministry fair we're doing today.
[1776.32 --> 1779.38]  There was some humming and hawing about whether or not we should do this.
[1779.84 --> 1781.20]  You know, a few years ago we did a ministry fair.
[1781.28 --> 1784.70]  We had just a lot going on and we want people to sign up and get involved.
[1784.82 --> 1788.82]  And this year, of course, with the rising COVID cases and all the concerns and anxiety in our city,
[1789.18 --> 1790.26]  we're like, well, should we do it?
[1790.82 --> 1791.48]  Should we do this?
[1791.52 --> 1792.22]  Should we do the barbecue?
[1792.44 --> 1795.06]  And as leaders and staff, we thought, of course.
[1795.98 --> 1797.96]  And for most of us, the question was simple.
[1798.92 --> 1800.90]  Not uncomplicated, but simple.
[1801.74 --> 1802.60]  We're called to serve.
[1803.26 --> 1803.90]  Do you believe that?
[1804.84 --> 1805.72]  We're called to serve.
[1807.02 --> 1807.84]  Yes, it's a pandemic.
[1808.04 --> 1811.44]  Yes, we have to think creatively, but we're called to use the gifts, the time, the strength,
[1811.52 --> 1815.78]  the authority, the power we have, even in this season, to kneel and wash the feet of our neighbors.
[1815.86 --> 1816.62]  Does that change?
[1817.58 --> 1818.50]  Does that stop?
[1819.06 --> 1821.92]  Do we got to press a pause button on Jesus' commission for us
[1821.92 --> 1825.34]  to kneel and wash our neighbor's feet in the midst of a pandemic?
[1825.34 --> 1825.66]  No.
[1825.66 --> 1827.44]  Do we have to think outside the box?
[1827.44 --> 1827.70]  No.
[1829.00 --> 1832.08]  Yes, we have to think outside the box, but I happen to think we're pretty good at that.
[1832.50 --> 1835.74]  And I've seen a lot of ministry leaders and a lot of volunteers in all sorts of ways
[1835.74 --> 1840.74]  think really creatively about how we can do church and minister well
[1840.74 --> 1843.14]  and serve our city well in the midst of this pandemic.
[1843.14 --> 1847.52]  And I happen to think there's a really good set of opportunities right in front of us
[1847.52 --> 1852.12]  in a city full of needs that needs the presence of followers of Jesus
[1852.12 --> 1855.42]  who are ready to give their lives away,
[1855.82 --> 1860.58]  to use their power, their authority, their influence, all of it, to bless.
[1861.64 --> 1865.28]  And so we're doing a ministry fair saying you're called to serve.
[1866.02 --> 1867.38]  This is how you're created to live.
[1868.04 --> 1871.64]  So find the ministries and the people who are serving in ways where you think,
[1871.72 --> 1872.56]  okay, I've got gifts there.
[1872.58 --> 1873.36]  I can help out there.
[1873.58 --> 1874.62]  Here's how I can get involved.
[1874.72 --> 1875.64]  I can disciple children.
[1875.88 --> 1876.72]  I can teach youth.
[1876.82 --> 1878.48]  I can serve at the Cloverdale Community Kitchen.
[1878.66 --> 1880.52]  I can get involved in refugee sponsorship.
[1881.34 --> 1881.98]  Put me in.
[1882.60 --> 1883.50]  We're called to serve.
[1887.62 --> 1889.50]  I'm hesitant to share this story, but you know what?
[1889.54 --> 1889.96]  Why not?
[1890.90 --> 1892.92]  A number of years ago, there's a church in Ontario,
[1893.60 --> 1895.56]  and the pastor, he did this every year.
[1896.54 --> 1898.20]  He called it, I don't know if it was actually called this,
[1898.26 --> 1900.86]  but I remember it being referred to as the bench clearing sermon.
[1901.74 --> 1904.70]  We did a whole sermon saying, hey, if you're new to our church, welcome.
[1905.36 --> 1906.76]  But if you just want to sit in the back,
[1906.82 --> 1909.02]  and you just want to like come to a service once a week,
[1909.04 --> 1911.34]  and you just want to not really get involved and do your own thing,
[1911.56 --> 1912.54]  go to a different church.
[1913.72 --> 1915.74]  I'm very hesitant to tell that story in the midst of COVID
[1915.74 --> 1917.98]  because every church is so worried about getting people back.
[1918.32 --> 1921.78]  But this pastor, he's still onto it even in this season.
[1921.78 --> 1926.54]  Our church is not interested in just attending a service once a week.
[1927.14 --> 1928.52]  That's not what it is to be the church.
[1928.78 --> 1929.94]  The church is not a service.
[1930.10 --> 1931.84]  That is one part of the body of the church.
[1932.60 --> 1933.76]  We're called to serve.
[1935.00 --> 1936.34]  And I want to remind us all,
[1936.60 --> 1938.80]  as we become members of the church, as we serve in the church,
[1938.94 --> 1942.66]  we're called to use everything we have to bless our neighbors,
[1943.20 --> 1944.44]  to serve our brothers and sisters,
[1944.58 --> 1945.70]  and give our lives away,
[1946.80 --> 1947.96]  annealing love for the world.
[1947.96 --> 1953.32]  And so to close, let me just remind us the movement of this passage.
[1953.48 --> 1954.38]  Jesus saying to Peter,
[1954.44 --> 1957.30]  and Jesus saying to every follower in his world,
[1957.88 --> 1960.50]  will you receive my cleansing work?
[1961.30 --> 1965.44]  Will you let me, your King, your Savior, wash you?
[1966.62 --> 1970.50]  And as a result of being cleansed and washed and filled with Jesus' Spirit,
[1971.32 --> 1976.96]  will you follow and kneel and wash the feet of the world?
[1977.96 --> 1978.78]  Let's pray.
[1984.08 --> 1985.82]  Father, we thank you for your word.
[1987.52 --> 1990.14]  And we pray that if there's areas where we feel deeply convicted,
[1990.28 --> 1991.40]  that we would sit with that.
[1992.48 --> 1995.98]  And we'd let your Spirit minister to us in the ways we need to be ministered to.
[1995.98 --> 2001.14]  If there's a hesitancy to use gifts, Lord,
[2002.04 --> 2003.40]  reveal how we can serve.
[2004.38 --> 2007.40]  If there's just a confusion over how we can serve faithfully,
[2007.74 --> 2009.82]  reveal to us, Lord, the gifts that we have.
[2010.46 --> 2011.22]  If there's fear,
[2012.26 --> 2013.60]  give us the confidence we need.
[2014.52 --> 2015.54]  And Lord, if there's laziness,
[2015.68 --> 2016.82]  confront that too.
[2016.82 --> 2019.42]  We pray, Lord,
[2019.48 --> 2021.06]  that you would fill us with your Spirit
[2021.06 --> 2024.42]  and that you would bless this city
[2024.42 --> 2026.10]  through the ministry of this church
[2026.10 --> 2028.50]  in a million ordinary ways.
[2029.22 --> 2030.66]  I pray that we would be known
[2030.66 --> 2032.38]  for washing the feet of this city
[2032.38 --> 2033.42]  and each other.
[2034.46 --> 2034.84]  And Lord,
[2034.88 --> 2035.56]  I pray too
[2035.56 --> 2036.78]  that we would go
[2036.78 --> 2038.24]  not trying to earn anything,
[2038.24 --> 2041.62]  but recognizing that you have finished the work.
[2042.66 --> 2044.40]  You have cleansed us through the death
[2044.40 --> 2046.00]  and the resurrection of Jesus.
[2046.78 --> 2048.06]  And we give you all the praise.
[2048.96 --> 2049.18]  Amen.
[2051.10 --> 2052.98]  I invite you to stand and join with me
[2052.98 --> 2054.52]  in singing our closing song,
[2054.68 --> 2055.26]  King of Kings.
