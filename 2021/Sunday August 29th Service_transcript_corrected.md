[0.00 → 10.00] We're at the Blues Central Centre and Blue Kayseri
[20.00 → 25.00] Special Al Watching
[25.00 → 54.98] Thank you.
[55.00 → 61.58] For those of you who aren't aware, my name is Pastor Sid Vander wood.
[62.04 → 66.68] You haven't, well you maybe saw me once in a while, but I haven't preached in about six months.
[67.66 → 73.62] And it's so good to be with you again, with you here, and with all of you online.
[74.28 → 77.12] It is a joy to be the Church of Jesus Christ together.
[79.90 → 81.82] I've had a good sabbatical.
[81.82 → 89.20] It was a good time of rest, a time of reflection, and an excellent break from Pastor Dave as well.
[93.62 → 95.54] Misha's nodding. Yeah, she understands.
[97.08 → 103.02] Today I'm going to continue the series that we've been in for a while now, in the book of Exodus.
[103.98 → 107.52] And we're going to read out of Exodus 32.
[107.90 → 113.66] It'll be up on the screen, or if you want to find it on your phones or on your Bibles that you have with you, Exodus 32.
[114.72 → 118.96] So let's read it together and see what God has to say to each of us this morning.
[118.96 → 129.96] When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron, and they said,
[130.12 → 134.56] Come, make us gods who will go before us.
[135.62 → 140.90] As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what's happened to him.
[142.34 → 143.12] And Aaron answered,
[143.12 → 148.04] Take off your gold earrings that your wives and your sons and your daughters are wearing and bring them to me.
[148.66 → 151.16] So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.
[151.40 → 158.04] He took them what they had handed him and made them into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioned it with a tool,
[158.42 → 158.86] and then said,
[158.98 → 162.78] These are your gods, Israel, who brought you out of Egypt.
[164.70 → 168.88] When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf, and he announced,
[169.20 → 171.42] Tomorrow there is a festival to the Lord.
[171.42 → 177.42] So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings.
[178.40 → 182.78] And afterwards they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.
[184.34 → 186.28] And then the Lord said to Moses,
[186.66 → 195.30] Go down, because your people, your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have become corrupt.
[196.12 → 198.88] They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them
[198.88 → 201.70] and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf.
[201.88 → 204.26] They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said,
[204.56 → 206.86] These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.
[208.06 → 212.26] I have seen these people, the Lord said to Moses, and they are a stiff-necked people.
[213.02 → 216.74] Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them.
[216.88 → 220.16] Then I will make you into a great nation.
[220.16 → 225.48] But Moses sought the favour of the Lord his God.
[226.16 → 226.84] The Lord, he said,
[227.16 → 230.90] Why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt,
[231.20 → 233.00] with great power and a mighty hand?
[233.46 → 237.78] Why should the Egyptians say it was with evil intent that he brought them out
[237.78 → 241.06] to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth?
[241.06 → 243.54] Turn from your fierce anger.
[243.66 → 244.02] Relent.
[244.12 → 245.84] Do not bring disaster on your people.
[246.22 → 249.32] Remember your servant Abraham and Isaac and Israel,
[249.54 → 251.74] whom you swore by your own self.
[253.28 → 257.26] I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars of the sky,
[257.38 → 260.40] and I will give your descendants all this land, I promise them,
[260.60 → 263.44] and it will be their inheritance forever.
[263.44 → 271.04] And then the Lord relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.
[272.04 → 278.12] And Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant of the law in his hands,
[278.62 → 283.34] and they were inscribed on both sides, front and back.
[285.22 → 288.88] And you can see Charlton Heston coming down the mountain with the tablets.
[289.84 → 292.48] Those of you who understand that reference, you're old.
[292.48 → 293.48] So.
[297.56 → 304.26] I don't know about you, but when I first read this, I can remember it,
[304.42 → 306.72] and even when I read it now, my first reaction is,
[307.36 → 308.64] seriously, Israel?
[310.16 → 310.68] Seriously?
[312.26 → 317.86] God frees you from 400 years of slavery, the 10 plagues happen.
[318.20 → 321.84] He takes care of you in the wilderness, even bringing bread and manna from heaven.
[321.84 → 324.36] He wants a deep relationship with you.
[324.52 → 326.96] He defines what life looks like.
[327.30 → 329.28] He gives you the law to help you live well.
[329.72 → 333.78] And then last week, we heard Dr. Joan preach on the building of the tabernacle,
[334.02 → 337.98] a sacred tent where God moved into the midst of the people,
[338.34 → 340.12] as Stu read, into the neighbourhood.
[341.58 → 344.46] Joan said, God is in the details last week.
[344.46 → 350.66] He is in the nitty-gritty of life because he is a God of your whole life.
[350.90 → 352.70] He's not compartmentalized.
[353.04 → 354.32] He isn't an add-on.
[354.64 → 357.88] He is the creator, the sustainer, the redeemer.
[358.68 → 362.24] He is the definer of all that is life.
[362.24 → 365.50] The author of life.
[367.12 → 370.32] And Joan said last week, and he needs to be taken seriously
[370.32 → 375.04] if we want to live what Jesus describes as life in all its fullness.
[375.04 → 379.74] And here, we have the people saying, you know what?
[379.92 → 381.00] Here's my plan.
[381.44 → 385.42] It's time for us to add some of our own details to what God is like.
[385.76 → 389.02] Make him fit our understanding, our context.
[389.44 → 391.42] Shape him a bit into our image.
[391.80 → 394.12] And we come up with this golden calf.
[398.02 → 399.76] And again, seriously, Israel?
[399.76 → 408.18] In AA, I've had a number of people that I care a lot about take part in AA.
[408.38 → 413.88] I've been to a number of AA cakes and had some interesting conversations with people.
[414.38 → 416.40] And there's a phrase in AA that says,
[416.80 → 418.92] you start with the God of your own understanding.
[419.90 → 420.80] Maybe you've heard that.
[421.22 → 422.66] You start with the God of your own understanding.
[423.12 → 424.48] That makes some sense.
[424.48 → 427.44] And yet, in some ways, and I've said this to people,
[427.44 → 433.90] in some ways, it's much better to say it is the God of his own understanding.
[435.42 → 438.44] If I say the God of my own understanding, of course I start there.
[438.86 → 439.74] Where else would I start?
[439.82 → 441.18] Because I only start with my own understanding.
[441.58 → 446.20] But I need to acknowledge what's more important is it matters who God says he is.
[446.74 → 449.68] It's not really, I don't get to define God.
[449.92 → 451.48] He gets to define himself.
[453.16 → 457.18] In this passage, there's this phrase that gets repeated five times.
[457.18 → 461.24] And when you read your Bibles, pay attention when phrases get repeated.
[462.44 → 466.80] And that phrase is from the land of Egypt.
[467.16 → 469.66] And it's repeated a number of places.
[469.80 → 470.88] One, in verse 1, it says,
[471.14 → 473.56] Moses led them from the land of Egypt.
[473.70 → 474.84] In verse 4, it says,
[474.92 → 477.18] The golden calf led them from the land of Egypt.
[477.42 → 478.32] In verse 7, it says,
[478.66 → 480.74] God says to Moses,
[481.04 → 482.48] You led them from the land of Egypt.
[482.48 → 484.28] And then Moses, in verse 11, says,
[484.36 → 486.56] God, you led them from the land of Egypt.
[488.34 → 490.52] And the question is being raised,
[490.94 → 493.58] Who's doing the leading here?
[495.12 → 496.72] Who's doing the leading?
[498.80 → 503.82] It's so easy for us to confess that God is in charge.
[504.08 → 505.64] And we have beautiful ways of saying it.
[505.64 → 507.56] Our God is sovereign.
[507.86 → 510.02] And He's sovereign over all things.
[510.22 → 512.16] And that's a beautiful thing to say.
[512.56 → 513.72] But here's the problem.
[514.02 → 517.06] Our life practices often say something else.
[519.06 → 521.26] He's sort of sovereign.
[522.10 → 525.40] He's sovereign when I let Him be sovereign.
[525.40 → 529.68] Okay, God, you can be sovereign now.
[529.76 → 530.90] Okay, no, no, no, I'm sovereign.
[531.60 → 532.88] And we live that way.
[533.24 → 536.00] And we make God fit our thoughts,
[536.30 → 538.14] our ideas, our agendas.
[539.14 → 543.38] And I feel anger at Israel's insanity
[543.38 → 545.36] because this is what it is.
[545.54 → 546.88] It is insanity.
[547.20 → 548.80] Sin is insanity.
[550.32 → 551.32] And so is mine.
[553.62 → 554.52] And so are yours.
[555.40 → 560.26] We can look at Israel here and shake our heads,
[560.38 → 562.34] but I find myself in the story as well.
[563.10 → 565.70] Days after God had said,
[566.14 → 567.02] with the commandment,
[567.08 → 567.20] He said,
[567.44 → 568.34] Make no images.
[568.70 → 570.52] They're making a golden calf.
[571.92 → 574.02] And Aaron, the priest,
[574.02 → 575.54] who's left in charge,
[576.04 → 577.94] is the one doing the making.
[580.92 → 581.52] Seriously?
[581.52 → 581.58] Seriously?
[583.58 → 590.80] He's bringing God into this whole distortion.
[591.78 → 592.40] It's madness.
[593.78 → 595.66] God defines Himself,
[596.30 → 597.88] and God defines life.
[599.18 → 601.62] He brings shalom into the details.
[602.38 → 602.48] Right?
[602.56 → 604.74] And then He brings shalom into the laws,
[604.84 → 605.34] and the feast,
[605.42 → 605.88] and the furniture,
[606.02 → 606.64] and the tabernacle,
[606.70 → 607.22] and the calendar,
[607.32 → 608.02] and the relationships.
[608.02 → 609.78] But we,
[609.92 → 612.94] we kind of want to have our say
[612.94 → 614.14] in the process.
[615.24 → 616.78] One writer I read called it
[616.78 → 618.36] idolatrous lunacy.
[619.62 → 620.64] I'm kind of like that.
[621.18 → 622.36] Idolatrous lunacy.
[622.60 → 623.18] It's madness.
[623.34 → 623.78] It's nuts.
[624.52 → 626.18] And after the golden calf is finished,
[626.58 → 627.72] Aaron builds an altar for it,
[627.72 → 629.58] and then He calls for a feast.
[629.92 → 630.12] You know,
[630.18 → 632.24] and God was into bringing feasts.
[632.32 → 633.10] Well, here's a feast.
[633.50 → 636.24] And He says the feast is to Yahweh.
[637.42 → 638.30] Hear that well.
[638.68 → 638.84] This,
[639.20 → 639.34] they,
[639.60 → 640.28] in His mind,
[640.36 → 642.30] He's still making it about God.
[643.68 → 644.28] You go,
[644.56 → 644.88] wow.
[645.98 → 646.40] Really?
[647.48 → 648.68] Let's bring God
[648.68 → 650.16] into this distortion
[650.16 → 651.70] that I'm making here.
[651.94 → 652.46] And let's like,
[652.56 → 653.58] let's somehow figure out
[653.58 → 655.10] how God's going to bless my ideas here.
[657.72 → 659.66] And again,
[660.72 → 662.72] the more I think about it,
[663.12 → 664.00] the more I thought about it,
[664.02 → 665.38] the more I reflected on it,
[665.44 → 666.02] I realize
[666.02 → 667.58] I'm the same
[667.58 → 668.92] as it are all often.
[670.12 → 670.56] In Scripture,
[670.72 → 671.16] we see it,
[671.24 → 672.06] what's going on here.
[672.12 → 673.44] In Jeremiah 17, 9,
[673.96 → 675.20] the writer writes,
[675.40 → 677.02] the heart is deceitful
[677.02 → 678.70] above all things
[678.70 → 680.56] and beyond cure.
[681.02 → 682.54] Who can understand it?
[683.60 → 684.40] Or the next verse,
[684.50 → 685.02] New Testament,
[685.26 → 685.90] James 3,
[686.32 → 687.58] out of the same mouth,
[688.14 → 688.58] your mouth,
[688.66 → 688.94] my mouth,
[689.00 → 689.68] out of the same mouth
[689.68 → 691.28] come praise and cursing.
[691.52 → 692.34] My brother and sister,
[692.46 → 693.30] this shouldn't be.
[694.92 → 695.66] Romans 7,
[695.78 → 696.88] Paul talking about himself.
[697.24 → 699.08] I don't understand what I do.
[699.54 → 700.64] For what I want to do,
[700.68 → 701.32] I don't do.
[701.66 → 702.36] And what I hate,
[702.46 → 702.94] I do.
[703.22 → 704.98] And if I do what I don't want to do,
[705.08 → 706.54] I agree that the law is good.
[706.78 → 708.06] And I'm not.
[708.06 → 708.12] I'm not.
[713.24 → 714.60] I mentioned phrases.
[715.34 → 716.92] There's a phrase in the Old Testament
[716.92 → 718.58] that I think describes well
[718.58 → 719.60] what happens
[719.60 → 720.30] when it's sort of
[720.30 → 721.48] at the heart of idolatry.
[721.90 → 723.04] I took one of the phrases
[723.04 → 724.66] in Deuteronomy 12, 8,
[725.26 → 725.98] where we read,
[726.48 → 727.78] you shall not do
[727.78 → 728.76] at all,
[728.84 → 730.00] you shall not
[730.00 → 730.98] at all do
[730.98 → 732.28] as we are doing here today.
[732.54 → 732.96] And then this,
[733.08 → 733.94] every man doing
[733.94 → 735.32] whatever is right
[735.32 → 736.08] in his own eyes.
[737.38 → 738.44] Every man doing
[738.44 → 739.00] what is right
[739.00 → 739.92] in his own eyes.
[739.92 → 741.48] in so many ways
[741.48 → 742.08] I feel like
[742.08 → 742.98] it describes
[742.98 → 743.98] today.
[748.48 → 750.26] We want to do
[750.26 → 752.14] what we want to do.
[754.52 → 756.10] We want rightness
[756.10 → 757.10] happening,
[757.30 → 759.08] but on our terms.
[761.40 → 762.12] Maybe you've heard
[762.12 → 762.78] this expression.
[762.92 → 763.86] I think it's sort of similar
[763.86 → 764.46] to what, you know,
[764.54 → 765.10] doing right
[765.10 → 765.68] in your own eyes.
[766.04 → 766.98] We say to people,
[767.14 → 768.16] to one another nowadays,
[768.16 → 769.46] well that's your truth.
[771.92 → 773.06] That's your truth.
[773.28 → 774.92] And I kind of
[774.92 → 775.62] want to point out,
[775.94 → 777.14] I don't say it this way
[777.14 → 777.92] to people directly,
[778.20 → 778.86] but I kind of want to point out
[778.86 → 779.72] that's kind of dumb.
[782.12 → 783.38] If you really think about it,
[783.44 → 784.40] that's your truth.
[784.84 → 786.40] Truth is truth.
[786.94 → 788.42] I might have a hard time
[788.42 → 789.54] finding it sometimes.
[789.68 → 790.40] That's true.
[790.66 → 791.80] We might have different
[791.80 → 793.12] ways of processing it,
[793.30 → 794.62] but the truth is the truth
[794.62 → 796.12] and we're on a search for it.
[798.16 → 802.00] I get the struggle,
[802.96 → 804.26] but I want the humility
[804.26 → 804.94] to say, listen,
[805.04 → 805.90] we're searching for truth
[805.90 → 806.88] and we don't always know
[806.88 → 807.52] how to get there,
[807.84 → 808.66] but God is trying
[808.66 → 809.86] to bring us to truth.
[814.70 → 816.24] In John's gospel,
[816.40 → 817.06] Jesus says,
[817.72 → 817.98] you know,
[818.02 → 818.80] about himself,
[819.20 → 819.90] then you will know
[819.90 → 820.42] the truth
[820.42 → 820.94] and the truth
[820.94 → 821.62] will set you free.
[823.72 → 824.80] Then you will know
[824.80 → 825.18] the truth.
[825.32 → 826.52] It will be revealed to you.
[826.52 → 827.78] Then you will know the truth
[827.78 → 828.20] and the truth
[828.20 → 829.00] will set you free.
[830.38 → 831.50] And our creator
[831.50 → 832.58] is a God of truth.
[832.90 → 833.30] And he,
[833.44 → 834.28] and here's an important word,
[834.48 → 835.72] he reveals it.
[837.08 → 838.46] He reveals it.
[838.62 → 840.32] You don't get to invent it.
[841.32 → 843.42] He reveals it to us
[843.42 → 844.86] as he did to Israel.
[846.16 → 847.88] And then we follow that truth
[847.88 → 849.94] because it's God's truth.
[850.04 → 851.28] It's the truth of life,
[851.38 → 852.38] the creator of life.
[852.38 → 854.12] And I know,
[854.22 → 854.82] I know for us
[854.82 → 856.40] it's not always black and white.
[856.48 → 857.46] I know people have messed
[857.46 → 858.02] with that too.
[858.20 → 860.12] But sometimes it is black and white
[860.12 → 861.10] and sometimes we just
[861.10 → 862.06] don't like it.
[865.54 → 866.86] Don't make any images.
[869.20 → 870.62] That's not too fuzzy.
[873.20 → 874.32] And they made an image.
[875.32 → 876.18] Don't kill.
[876.18 → 876.26] Don't kill.
[876.26 → 882.38] Don't commit adultery.
[885.56 → 886.36] Jesus says,
[886.80 → 888.10] and don't even put those thoughts
[888.10 → 889.08] in your brain.
[894.68 → 895.20] People
[895.20 → 897.60] want a God.
[898.04 → 899.38] Here's the problem with idolatry.
[899.46 → 900.04] They want a God
[900.04 → 900.82] that they control,
[901.14 → 901.98] that they define,
[901.98 → 904.54] that they manage.
[905.84 → 907.92] I didn't put the story down
[907.92 → 908.58] but there's a story
[908.58 → 909.38] in the Old Testament
[909.38 → 912.40] where there's a priest
[912.40 → 913.00] named Eli.
[914.28 → 915.46] He's not a very good priest
[915.46 → 915.96] of Israel
[915.96 → 916.96] but he is the priest.
[917.68 → 918.68] There's the Ark of the Covenant.
[920.48 → 921.52] Joan described it rather well.
[921.56 → 922.54] Last week had a picture of it.
[922.82 → 922.98] Right?
[923.08 → 923.92] You got the cherubim,
[924.00 → 925.24] the angels with their wings touching.
[925.72 → 926.76] God's seat in the middle there.
[926.76 → 927.62] This is a representation
[927.62 → 928.52] of God here.
[929.18 → 929.48] You might say,
[929.54 → 930.12] was this an image?
[930.12 → 932.10] This is an image God himself made.
[933.40 → 934.50] And God designed it
[934.50 → 934.96] and God said,
[935.08 → 935.68] just build this
[935.68 → 937.88] and it's not me.
[938.78 → 939.72] But the people of Israel
[939.72 → 940.80] were even taking the things
[940.80 → 941.24] of the temple
[941.24 → 942.08] and making them into
[942.08 → 944.68] somehow idolatrous things here.
[945.10 → 946.06] And Eli's sons
[946.06 → 947.44] who weren't very good guys,
[947.76 → 949.24] there's a war going on
[949.24 → 950.70] and they want to win the war
[950.70 → 951.62] so they decide
[951.62 → 952.16] they were going to take
[952.16 → 952.92] the Ark of the Covenant,
[953.06 → 953.44] we're going to put it
[953.44 → 953.94] on our shoulders
[953.94 → 955.38] and we're going to march into war
[955.38 → 956.80] and then we got God with us
[956.80 → 957.94] and God will do the fighting for us.
[958.54 → 958.94] And you know,
[959.00 → 959.44] they didn't ask
[959.44 → 960.08] whether God wanted
[960.08 → 960.82] to go into war with them.
[961.74 → 962.64] They just took them.
[962.78 → 964.38] And it goes extremely poorly.
[965.98 → 966.42] And often,
[966.66 → 967.46] I picture that
[967.46 → 968.70] we would love a God.
[969.24 → 969.50] Okay,
[969.62 → 970.58] I need God right now.
[970.94 → 971.70] Let's go God.
[972.32 → 973.26] Off we go here.
[973.74 → 974.40] There we go God.
[974.46 → 974.68] Okay,
[974.80 → 975.36] do your thing.
[975.60 → 975.86] Okay,
[976.10 → 976.84] back you there.
[977.26 → 978.60] We like a God
[978.60 → 979.36] in a box.
[982.96 → 983.32] Right?
[984.44 → 985.24] I think we almost
[985.24 → 986.24] prefer a genie idea.
[986.44 → 986.60] Okay,
[986.64 → 987.26] okay God,
[987.44 → 987.80] come out.
[987.80 → 988.04] Okay,
[988.14 → 988.48] do this.
[988.56 → 988.70] Okay,
[988.76 → 989.46] now get back a bottle.
[991.04 → 991.32] Right?
[994.76 → 996.38] A God who defines everything
[996.38 → 997.30] and we submit,
[997.42 → 997.96] we surrender
[997.96 → 999.04] because that's where life is.
[999.46 → 1000.68] That's what's going on here.
[1004.10 → 1005.42] From the beginning,
[1006.00 → 1006.84] when you look in Genesis,
[1006.96 → 1007.48] from the beginning,
[1007.60 → 1007.90] you know what,
[1008.14 → 1009.22] the thing that tips it
[1009.22 → 1010.24] for Adam and Eve,
[1010.54 → 1012.18] you will be like God.
[1012.18 → 1014.20] you will be like God.
[1015.46 → 1016.14] Here's Aaron
[1016.14 → 1018.04] standing there.
[1018.36 → 1018.68] This,
[1018.86 → 1019.76] here's the golden calf.
[1020.00 → 1021.14] This is your God,
[1021.22 → 1021.94] O Israel.
[1025.34 → 1026.60] This is Yahweh.
[1027.64 → 1028.12] You see,
[1028.12 → 1028.76] you see them
[1028.76 → 1029.64] mucking around
[1029.64 → 1030.82] with it here.
[1031.28 → 1031.46] This,
[1031.58 → 1032.84] this isn't an image.
[1032.94 → 1033.20] This is,
[1033.36 → 1034.58] this is kind of
[1034.58 → 1035.92] a picture of Yahweh.
[1035.92 → 1036.10] Yeah.
[1036.10 → 1038.60] You know,
[1038.70 → 1040.80] it's not that big a deal.
[1041.72 → 1042.96] It's still Yahweh.
[1043.68 → 1045.50] It's still Jehovah God.
[1045.50 → 1054.72] And we mix truth
[1054.72 → 1055.94] and we mix lies
[1055.94 → 1058.42] and we often don't even know
[1058.42 → 1058.94] we're doing it.
[1061.34 → 1062.58] There's this confession,
[1062.92 → 1064.06] old ancient confession
[1064.06 → 1065.10] that the church has
[1065.10 → 1066.92] and it talks about
[1066.92 → 1068.24] an incomprehensible God.
[1070.02 → 1071.34] And it uses that phrase
[1071.34 → 1071.72] quite often,
[1071.86 → 1073.06] an incomprehensible God.
[1074.20 → 1075.04] First time you hear that,
[1075.12 → 1075.22] you go,
[1075.22 → 1075.88] incomprehensible,
[1076.00 → 1076.82] that's not necessarily
[1076.82 → 1077.28] a good thing.
[1078.12 → 1078.68] It's not saying
[1078.68 → 1079.12] there's nothing
[1079.12 → 1079.94] you can comprehend.
[1080.38 → 1081.48] But it's saying
[1081.48 → 1083.54] God is always more
[1083.54 → 1084.66] than you think.
[1086.84 → 1087.64] If you think
[1087.64 → 1088.58] you got it settled,
[1089.66 → 1090.30] let me tell you
[1090.30 → 1091.52] exactly who God is,
[1093.32 → 1093.92] then the
[1094.36 → 1094.62] no, no,
[1094.64 → 1095.64] he's an incomprehensible God.
[1095.80 → 1096.70] He's bigger than
[1096.70 → 1097.74] what you just said.
[1100.88 → 1101.72] Let me jump
[1101.72 → 1102.44] a wee little bit
[1102.44 → 1103.20] aside here
[1103.20 → 1104.84] for a moment here
[1104.84 → 1106.58] I wasn't going to get
[1106.58 → 1107.44] into this part of the story
[1107.44 → 1108.16] because there's a lot
[1108.16 → 1108.90] in this passage.
[1109.28 → 1110.50] But notice here
[1110.50 → 1112.26] that Moses seems
[1112.26 → 1114.00] to change God's mind.
[1115.14 → 1115.24] Right?
[1115.38 → 1115.54] You know,
[1116.60 → 1117.60] Israel's,
[1118.12 → 1118.38] he said,
[1118.44 → 1119.08] I'm going to destroy
[1119.08 → 1119.70] these people,
[1120.06 → 1120.26] Moses,
[1120.34 → 1120.74] and I'm going to
[1120.74 → 1121.96] start over with you.
[1122.22 → 1123.78] We'll just go to plan B
[1123.78 → 1124.62] on this one here.
[1126.02 → 1126.80] There's a lot
[1126.80 → 1127.56] of discussion around
[1127.56 → 1128.26] all of this.
[1128.34 → 1129.14] Did Moses actually
[1129.14 → 1129.94] change God's mind?
[1129.94 → 1130.00] God.
[1131.10 → 1132.28] And God would have been
[1132.28 → 1133.90] just in punishing
[1133.90 → 1134.30] the people
[1134.30 → 1134.74] because this was
[1134.74 → 1135.94] a grave, grave sin.
[1137.50 → 1138.68] We serve a God
[1138.68 → 1140.50] who rightly hates sin.
[1140.88 → 1141.82] Aren't you glad
[1141.82 → 1142.40] about that?
[1144.20 → 1145.00] That we serve a God
[1145.00 → 1146.56] who hates sin,
[1146.68 → 1148.12] who hates evil.
[1149.28 → 1150.00] I'm so glad
[1150.00 → 1150.44] we have a God
[1150.44 → 1150.88] who does.
[1152.34 → 1153.30] And so here,
[1153.48 → 1153.78] then I said,
[1153.86 → 1153.94] well,
[1154.04 → 1154.58] Moses then,
[1155.02 → 1156.28] here's God mad
[1156.28 → 1157.92] and furious
[1157.92 → 1158.58] and rightly angry
[1158.58 → 1159.68] and Moses then,
[1159.76 → 1160.10] it says,
[1160.36 → 1161.44] seeks the favour of the Lord.
[1163.90 → 1164.92] And this conversation
[1164.92 → 1166.06] fascinates me.
[1166.86 → 1167.24] He says,
[1167.34 → 1167.54] God,
[1167.60 → 1167.98] you know what?
[1168.48 → 1169.36] You're going to look
[1169.36 → 1170.80] terrible
[1170.80 → 1173.30] to these surrounding nations.
[1173.38 → 1173.74] They're going to say,
[1173.80 → 1174.70] wow,
[1174.86 → 1175.92] that's a great God.
[1176.40 → 1176.56] You know,
[1176.56 → 1177.24] he took his people
[1177.24 → 1177.64] out there
[1177.64 → 1178.66] and killed them all.
[1178.84 → 1179.50] Was that the plan
[1179.50 → 1180.10] all along?
[1181.10 → 1182.34] And what he's
[1182.34 → 1183.60] really referencing is,
[1183.84 → 1184.48] and if you remember
[1184.48 → 1185.66] Dave talking about it
[1185.66 → 1187.68] where God talking
[1187.68 → 1188.50] to Abraham and said,
[1188.90 → 1189.12] you know,
[1189.22 → 1189.94] this covenant,
[1190.08 → 1190.84] this eternal covenant
[1190.84 → 1191.78] is going to be
[1191.78 → 1192.98] a blessing to you
[1192.98 → 1194.98] and to all people.
[1198.34 → 1198.64] And so,
[1198.84 → 1199.46] in this,
[1199.86 → 1200.62] Moses is kind of saying,
[1200.68 → 1202.18] you know that blessing part
[1202.18 → 1203.02] where we were going
[1203.02 → 1203.68] to be the blessing,
[1203.80 → 1204.24] I know we're not
[1204.24 → 1204.90] a very good blessing
[1204.90 → 1205.62] up to this point,
[1205.92 → 1206.46] but that's,
[1206.70 → 1207.50] you're going to look,
[1208.00 → 1209.84] you're going to look
[1209.84 → 1210.64] terrible on this one,
[1210.68 → 1210.82] God,
[1210.90 → 1211.42] that you don't keep
[1211.42 → 1211.82] your word.
[1214.10 → 1215.42] And then he reminds God,
[1215.42 → 1216.58] and remember this whole
[1216.58 → 1218.24] promise to Abraham,
[1218.30 → 1218.46] Isaac,
[1218.58 → 1218.88] Jacob,
[1219.88 → 1220.80] a covenant nation
[1220.80 → 1221.82] for all eternity
[1221.82 → 1222.40] kind of thing.
[1223.22 → 1223.44] Yeah,
[1223.56 → 1223.80] God,
[1224.00 → 1227.04] how's that going to work?
[1231.00 → 1231.82] And we see here
[1231.82 → 1232.76] God changed his mind.
[1234.44 → 1235.90] I wanted to share that
[1235.90 → 1236.44] and talk on that
[1236.44 → 1236.76] a little bit.
[1236.80 → 1237.40] I wasn't going to,
[1237.46 → 1238.14] but I thought about it later.
[1238.48 → 1239.80] This incomprehensible
[1239.80 → 1240.36] God thing.
[1241.02 → 1241.68] God is always more
[1241.68 → 1242.14] than you think.
[1242.56 → 1243.38] We have a God here,
[1243.44 → 1244.28] we see him as redeemer,
[1244.28 → 1245.26] we see him as judge,
[1245.32 → 1246.14] we see him as Lord,
[1246.34 → 1247.06] we see him loving,
[1247.20 → 1248.04] we see him angry.
[1249.52 → 1250.70] And then we see him
[1250.70 → 1252.22] open to human approach,
[1252.50 → 1253.56] and we see him
[1253.56 → 1255.58] responsive to our,
[1256.24 → 1257.74] to our lives,
[1257.82 → 1258.38] to our prayers,
[1258.54 → 1259.66] to our inquiries,
[1259.80 → 1261.08] to our desires.
[1262.26 → 1263.22] And I'm amazed.
[1264.38 → 1265.06] And I'm not saying
[1265.06 → 1266.50] I'm going to completely
[1266.50 → 1268.32] settle all that one.
[1268.32 → 1271.10] But Moses intercedes,
[1271.30 → 1272.98] and we have an Old Testament
[1272.98 → 1274.06] picture of what Jesus
[1274.06 → 1274.80] is going to do.
[1275.12 → 1275.80] And Jesus comes
[1275.80 → 1276.74] before the Father.
[1277.52 → 1279.30] I remember being at a
[1279.92 → 1281.06] when I was a teenage kid,
[1281.30 → 1282.54] after a hockey tournament,
[1282.62 → 1284.02] we were sitting in a restaurant
[1284.02 → 1284.62] with my parents,
[1284.68 → 1286.14] and this guy came in,
[1286.30 → 1287.76] and he looked kind of scruffy,
[1287.84 → 1288.52] and I thought,
[1288.58 → 1289.44] oh, just a homeless guy,
[1289.54 → 1291.08] but he was just a guy.
[1292.04 → 1293.44] And he talked to us
[1293.44 → 1294.44] and found out we were Christians.
[1295.18 → 1296.24] And he had a picture
[1296.24 → 1297.04] in his mind
[1297.04 → 1298.54] of going to heaven
[1298.54 → 1301.62] and, you know,
[1301.66 → 1302.68] coming before God,
[1302.84 → 1304.00] and then he said,
[1304.16 → 1305.08] then they were going to show
[1305.08 → 1305.94] the whole videotape
[1305.94 → 1306.66] of your whole life.
[1307.56 → 1308.18] And he's going,
[1308.30 → 1308.72] oh, man,
[1308.76 → 1310.36] this is going to be really bad.
[1311.48 → 1312.72] And then Jesus comes out
[1312.72 → 1312.92] and said,
[1312.98 → 1313.82] no, no, Father,
[1314.56 → 1315.24] he's one of mine.
[1315.32 → 1316.48] You don't have to watch the tape.
[1321.08 → 1324.76] And I think this God
[1324.76 → 1326.50] who loves us so much,
[1326.54 → 1327.58] who loves Israel so much,
[1327.94 → 1330.20] he doesn't want to condemn us.
[1330.60 → 1331.52] He wants to condemn
[1331.52 → 1334.26] and break the power of sin.
[1336.80 → 1337.32] And he's open.
[1337.76 → 1339.92] You know, Moses intercedes,
[1340.20 → 1341.38] and that's a picture of Jesus.
[1341.74 → 1344.88] And then we get to intercede.
[1347.92 → 1349.76] We get to take on
[1349.76 → 1350.94] a Christ-like activity.
[1351.12 → 1352.54] That's what your prayer life is.
[1352.78 → 1353.26] You get to,
[1353.68 → 1354.90] one phrase in the Bible,
[1355.00 → 1356.06] stand in the gap.
[1356.46 → 1357.82] You get to intercede.
[1358.10 → 1359.84] And it makes a difference.
[1364.74 → 1366.66] An incomprehensible God
[1366.66 → 1367.86] because he's bigger
[1367.86 → 1369.12] than what you think he is.
[1369.38 → 1370.46] And if you think get bigger,
[1370.76 → 1371.58] then he's still bigger.
[1371.86 → 1372.92] And when you get there next,
[1373.02 → 1374.14] he's still bigger than that.
[1374.20 → 1375.46] And he's still more than that.
[1377.30 → 1378.20] Your definitions
[1378.20 → 1379.40] are always too small.
[1379.76 → 1384.06] I like how it's,
[1384.44 → 1385.76] C.S. Lewis describes it
[1385.76 → 1386.24] in the Lion, the Witch,
[1386.26 → 1386.98] and the Wardrobe, right?
[1387.68 → 1389.38] The kids come to the land of Narnia.
[1389.60 → 1390.50] Maybe some of you've read the books,
[1390.58 → 1391.02] watched a movie.
[1391.70 → 1393.10] And they haven't seen Aslan before.
[1393.16 → 1394.14] They find out he's a lion.
[1394.60 → 1396.12] They're talking to Mr. and Mrs. Beaver.
[1396.76 → 1398.08] And, you know,
[1398.32 → 1398.92] Ms. Beaver says,
[1399.00 → 1399.84] Aslan is a lion.
[1399.90 → 1401.08] The lion, the great lion.
[1401.74 → 1402.90] And, ooh, said Susan,
[1403.04 → 1404.20] I thought he was a man.
[1404.44 → 1405.54] Is he quite safe?
[1405.54 → 1409.34] I shall feel rather nervous
[1409.34 → 1410.02] about meeting a lion,
[1410.10 → 1410.46] she says.
[1410.96 → 1411.98] Well, that you will, dearie.
[1412.04 → 1412.70] And no mistake,
[1412.78 → 1413.42] said Mrs. Beaver.
[1413.62 → 1414.54] If there's anyone
[1414.54 → 1416.02] who can appear before Aslan
[1416.02 → 1417.04] without their knees knocking,
[1417.42 → 1418.16] they're either braver
[1418.16 → 1418.78] than most of them
[1418.78 → 1419.80] or just plain silly.
[1421.10 → 1421.72] Well, then,
[1421.82 → 1422.94] is he safe?
[1423.06 → 1423.66] Said Lucy.
[1424.66 → 1425.74] Safe, said Mr. Beaver.
[1425.80 → 1426.32] Did you hear
[1426.32 → 1427.72] what Mrs. Beaver tells you?
[1427.92 → 1429.36] Who said anything about safe?
[1429.58 → 1431.04] He isn't safe,
[1431.04 → 1432.48] but he's good.
[1438.58 → 1440.72] An incomprehensible God.
[1441.12 → 1442.64] He's not safe,
[1442.78 → 1443.56] but he's good.
[1443.80 → 1445.38] He's bigger than you say.
[1445.66 → 1446.74] You can't make an image.
[1446.84 → 1447.02] Why?
[1447.12 → 1447.66] Because your image
[1447.66 → 1449.36] is far from complete.
[1449.58 → 1450.76] It doesn't work.
[1452.20 → 1453.64] It's too small.
[1454.96 → 1456.98] This God is the king.
[1458.08 → 1460.42] And he reveals who he is.
[1462.00 → 1463.52] And we follow him.
[1464.16 → 1466.50] Idolatry is such a ridiculous attempt
[1466.50 → 1467.50] to manage God
[1467.50 → 1469.18] as if that will free us.
[1469.94 → 1470.08] I mean,
[1470.12 → 1471.32] if I just make God,
[1471.56 → 1472.74] tailor design God,
[1472.94 → 1474.32] then I can do whatever I want
[1474.32 → 1476.56] and still be God's follower.
[1477.46 → 1478.88] Although I'm asking him to follow me.
[1483.96 → 1486.06] Freedom comes in Christ alone.
[1487.22 → 1488.64] And the truth revealed
[1488.64 → 1489.90] by the author of life.
[1489.90 → 1491.64] That's the way to freedom.
[1492.96 → 1494.32] And that takes a lot of surrender.
[1495.22 → 1496.68] Paul writes in Galatians 5,
[1497.48 → 1498.26] It is for freedom
[1498.26 → 1499.66] that Christ has set us free.
[1500.64 → 1501.76] Stand firm then
[1501.76 → 1503.04] and don't let yourself
[1503.04 → 1503.82] be burdened again
[1503.82 → 1504.92] by a yoke of slavery.
[1505.18 → 1505.92] And he's referencing
[1505.92 → 1507.38] the slavery of the people of Israel here.
[1507.94 → 1509.26] You, my brothers and sisters,
[1509.80 → 1511.28] who were called to be free,
[1511.54 → 1512.92] do not use your freedom
[1512.92 → 1514.56] to indulge in the flesh.
[1514.74 → 1515.04] Rather,
[1515.04 → 1517.12] serve one another humbly in love.
[1517.60 → 1519.02] For the entire law
[1519.02 → 1520.50] is fulfilled
[1520.50 → 1522.68] in keeping this one command.
[1523.40 → 1525.42] Love your neighbour as yourself.
[1525.42 → 1529.58] If you bite and devour each other,
[1529.64 → 1530.14] watch out
[1530.14 → 1531.10] or you will be destroyed
[1531.10 → 1531.76] by each other.
[1531.94 → 1533.20] And isn't that a good warning
[1533.20 → 1533.68] for today?
[1534.74 → 1535.34] So I say,
[1535.66 → 1536.52] walk by the Spirit
[1536.52 → 1538.38] and then you will not gratify
[1538.38 → 1539.42] the desires of the flesh.
[1543.64 → 1545.52] Israel needed to understand,
[1545.64 → 1546.78] as do I and as do you,
[1547.30 → 1548.68] that God can't be controlled.
[1549.60 → 1550.36] And that's a good thing.
[1551.72 → 1552.96] That's a very, very good thing.
[1554.28 → 1556.42] In their culture in Egypt,
[1557.24 → 1558.58] they had seen gods.
[1559.90 → 1560.56] My wife and I
[1560.56 → 1561.20] had the privilege
[1561.20 → 1562.30] of going on a trip to Egypt
[1562.30 → 1564.10] and Israel and Jordan.
[1564.28 → 1566.28] And Egypt is loaded with images.
[1566.80 → 1568.48] Beautiful, fascinating images.
[1568.60 → 1569.64] The images nonetheless.
[1570.54 → 1572.68] And the slave people of Israel
[1572.68 → 1573.46] grew up in a culture
[1573.46 → 1574.16] where there were images
[1574.16 → 1574.98] of gods everywhere.
[1575.32 → 1576.42] So they're just kind of doing
[1576.42 → 1579.10] what they sort of saw
[1579.10 → 1580.38] in Egypt here.
[1580.96 → 1582.06] They liked the idea
[1582.06 → 1582.82] of measuring God
[1582.82 → 1584.22] by some kind of standard here.
[1584.50 → 1585.30] And now they have
[1585.30 → 1586.32] some unlearning to do,
[1586.50 → 1587.06] as do I,
[1587.12 → 1588.26] when I try to make God
[1588.26 → 1589.34] fit my terms.
[1590.72 → 1592.16] Or we try to mix a bit
[1592.16 → 1593.86] of the golden calf
[1593.86 → 1595.74] with a bit of Yahweh.
[1598.30 → 1599.64] I didn't read the whole chapter
[1599.64 → 1600.06] to you,
[1600.32 → 1602.12] but I have to just share
[1602.12 → 1602.60] this one part
[1602.60 → 1603.48] because it made me laugh
[1603.48 → 1605.30] so hard in so many ways.
[1605.30 → 1607.74] So here's the golden calf happening.
[1608.06 → 1609.10] Moses is coming down.
[1609.18 → 1610.14] He's got the tablets, right?
[1610.50 → 1611.22] He's coming down,
[1611.26 → 1612.12] but he's mad now.
[1612.74 → 1613.30] Of course, we know
[1613.30 → 1614.24] he smashes the tablets
[1614.24 → 1614.62] and all that.
[1614.86 → 1615.94] But he confronts Aaron.
[1616.34 → 1617.60] And I have some verses
[1617.60 → 1618.34] down from that
[1618.34 → 1620.00] out of Exodus 32.
[1620.72 → 1621.62] And look at it with me.
[1621.76 → 1622.68] He said to Aaron,
[1622.94 → 1624.38] and I share this
[1624.38 → 1625.66] because it's funny, I think,
[1626.08 → 1628.30] but also it shows
[1628.30 → 1629.24] what sin does to us.
[1629.88 → 1630.34] He said to Aaron,
[1630.52 → 1632.52] what did these people do to you
[1632.52 → 1633.82] that you led them
[1633.82 → 1635.20] in such great sin?
[1637.40 → 1638.38] Don't be angry,
[1638.46 → 1639.68] my Lord, Aaron answered.
[1640.04 → 1641.10] You know how prone
[1641.10 → 1642.34] these people are to evil.
[1643.52 → 1644.36] I love that, right?
[1644.56 → 1645.70] You know what they're like.
[1646.16 → 1647.42] What else could I do here, right?
[1648.08 → 1649.84] And they said to me,
[1650.10 → 1650.86] make us gods
[1650.86 → 1651.86] who will go before us.
[1652.14 → 1653.42] As for this fellow Moses
[1653.42 → 1654.66] who brought us out of Egypt,
[1655.14 → 1655.70] we don't know
[1655.70 → 1656.72] what has happened to him.
[1657.50 → 1658.40] So I told them,
[1658.54 → 1660.38] well, whoever has any gold,
[1660.52 → 1661.52] jewellery, take it off.
[1661.52 → 1663.86] And then they gave me the gold.
[1664.18 → 1664.90] And read this.
[1665.40 → 1666.50] And I threw it in the fire
[1666.50 → 1668.28] and outcomes the calf.
[1670.60 → 1672.36] I wasn't making a calf.
[1672.70 → 1673.24] Threw the gold on it.
[1673.30 → 1674.06] There it is.
[1676.46 → 1677.94] Sin makes us stupid.
[1680.84 → 1682.48] It really does.
[1682.76 → 1684.98] Idols are such illusions
[1684.98 → 1686.68] and they're misplaced hopes.
[1687.92 → 1689.00] Here's a great quote.
[1689.00 → 1692.02] There's a slide of it here
[1692.02 → 1692.74] and it says,
[1693.24 → 1695.88] one very difficult aspect of sin.
[1696.82 → 1698.46] I think we have a slide of it.
[1698.96 → 1699.18] I hope.
[1700.42 → 1701.00] After that.
[1702.60 → 1703.38] There we go.
[1703.72 → 1705.78] One very difficult aspect of sin
[1705.78 → 1707.60] is that my sin never,
[1707.74 → 1709.68] and I would have chosen the word rarity,
[1709.82 → 1711.52] but never feels like sin to me.
[1711.86 → 1713.76] My sin feels like life to me,
[1713.84 → 1714.78] plain and simple.
[1714.78 → 1717.60] My heart is an idol factory.
[1717.72 → 1719.38] That's a quote from John Calvin here.
[1719.70 → 1721.64] And my mind an excuse-making factory.
[1727.04 → 1729.26] We create an illusion of life.
[1729.66 → 1731.30] This is one of the dilemmas of addiction.
[1732.76 → 1732.94] Right?
[1732.94 → 1733.24] You know,
[1733.36 → 1735.80] alcohol becomes an idol
[1735.80 → 1739.14] and we manage it until it manages us.
[1740.22 → 1741.44] And there are a lot of things like that.
[1742.22 → 1742.40] You know,
[1742.40 → 1742.78] work,
[1743.58 → 1743.94] sex,
[1744.60 → 1745.38] all kinds of things.
[1745.76 → 1748.48] We turn it into something it shouldn't be
[1748.48 → 1750.62] and then we think we're running it.
[1750.88 → 1752.38] Somehow it satisfies something in us
[1752.38 → 1753.24] but it doesn't really satisfy.
[1753.62 → 1755.82] And then it uses us
[1755.82 → 1758.02] and sucks life out of us
[1758.02 → 1759.46] and leaves us empty.
[1762.38 → 1764.06] We can make idols out of anything.
[1765.16 → 1765.48] Race,
[1766.14 → 1766.48] careers,
[1766.82 → 1767.08] sex,
[1767.22 → 1767.44] money,
[1767.62 → 1768.00] nations,
[1768.18 → 1768.54] age,
[1769.44 → 1769.82] power,
[1770.06 → 1770.38] media,
[1771.12 → 1772.32] even families.
[1773.78 → 1774.38] You might go,
[1774.50 → 1775.36] wait a minute here.
[1775.54 → 1776.48] Even families.
[1776.74 → 1776.86] You know,
[1776.98 → 1778.86] there's a verse that always bugs me
[1778.86 → 1780.84] but it's a fascinating verse
[1780.84 → 1781.78] where Jesus says,
[1782.18 → 1783.80] anyone who puts father, mother, sister, brother
[1783.80 → 1784.18] ahead of me
[1784.18 → 1785.06] is not worthy of me.
[1785.50 → 1785.80] And you go,
[1785.88 → 1786.10] ooh,
[1786.40 → 1786.58] ow,
[1786.58 → 1787.04] that stings.
[1787.04 → 1788.58] But what he's really saying is,
[1788.80 → 1790.70] your family can't be God.
[1794.54 → 1795.22] That's all.
[1798.84 → 1800.64] Because when we do this,
[1800.82 → 1802.00] when we take this idol
[1802.00 → 1803.94] and we think it's going to give us something
[1803.94 → 1804.88] that it can't
[1804.88 → 1807.52] and then it's going to take us back to Egypt,
[1807.98 → 1808.98] back to slavery,
[1809.24 → 1810.80] that's what's going to happen.
[1811.06 → 1812.30] That's what is happening.
[1817.04 → 1818.84] In case you think,
[1818.92 → 1819.04] well,
[1819.04 → 1820.38] this is just an Old Testament story,
[1821.02 → 1822.80] I threw a little bit of 1 Corinthians.
[1823.26 → 1823.60] Paul,
[1824.96 → 1825.44] so we're,
[1825.56 → 1825.72] you know,
[1825.90 → 1826.26] Moses,
[1826.98 → 1828.08] the story of the people of Israel,
[1828.20 → 1829.28] around 1500 BC,
[1830.40 → 1832.72] something like that.
[1832.72 → 1834.80] And then we jump ahead to Paul.
[1834.86 → 1835.58] I just want you to see,
[1835.92 → 1836.78] these stories are not,
[1836.94 → 1837.22] oh,
[1837.30 → 1838.70] that's those stupid people,
[1838.76 → 1839.28] they build idols.
[1839.68 → 1839.80] No,
[1839.84 → 1839.90] no,
[1840.10 → 1840.38] I mean,
[1840.50 → 1841.66] in the New Testament,
[1841.98 → 1842.54] in Corinth,
[1843.68 → 1845.02] Paul writes in 1 Corinthians
[1845.02 → 1845.88] to the people
[1845.88 → 1848.22] who talk about this story.
[1848.38 → 1849.76] He writes in this story here.
[1850.32 → 1851.88] And the Corinthians are wrestling
[1851.88 → 1853.46] with their own cultural influences.
[1854.28 → 1855.32] And the big influence
[1855.32 → 1856.56] is food offered to idols.
[1856.56 → 1859.06] And we read here
[1859.06 → 1860.16] out of 1 Corinthians.
[1860.96 → 1862.44] And you can look at it with me here.
[1866.08 → 1867.26] I can find it here.
[1869.04 → 1870.04] Where we read this.
[1870.60 → 1871.92] Now these things occurred,
[1872.32 → 1873.98] those examples of the stories
[1873.98 → 1875.54] of the wilderness there in the Bible.
[1876.00 → 1877.18] These things occurred as examples
[1877.18 → 1878.58] to keep us from setting our hearts
[1878.58 → 1879.80] on evil things as they did.
[1880.70 → 1880.94] All right?
[1881.48 → 1882.80] Do not be adulterers
[1882.80 → 1883.54] as some of them were.
[1883.82 → 1884.54] As it is written,
[1884.62 → 1885.58] the people sat down
[1885.58 → 1886.40] to eat and drink
[1886.40 → 1887.18] and got up
[1887.18 → 1888.52] and indulged in revelry.
[1888.74 → 1889.60] And the revelry there
[1889.60 → 1890.58] is of a sexual nature.
[1891.52 → 1892.92] These things happened to them
[1892.92 → 1893.68] as examples
[1893.68 → 1894.52] and were written down
[1894.52 → 1895.52] as warnings for us
[1895.52 → 1896.74] on whom the culmination
[1896.74 → 1897.66] of the ages has come.
[1897.94 → 1898.76] So if you think
[1898.76 → 1900.56] you are standing firm,
[1900.82 → 1902.74] be careful lest ye fall.
[1904.24 → 1904.64] And therefore,
[1904.72 → 1905.36] my dear friends,
[1905.44 → 1906.30] and here's the phrase,
[1906.76 → 1908.44] flee from idolatry.
[1909.78 → 1910.20] And as I said,
[1910.28 → 1911.26] the Corinthians were wrestling
[1911.26 → 1912.38] with this food offered to idols.
[1912.50 → 1913.02] Could you eat it?
[1913.08 → 1913.78] Could you not eat it?
[1913.98 → 1914.74] And you get a yes
[1914.74 → 1915.40] and you get a no.
[1915.40 → 1916.14] Paul says,
[1916.24 → 1916.88] yes you can
[1916.88 → 1918.12] because it's just meat.
[1919.00 → 1919.32] But,
[1919.44 → 1920.78] but he stops there
[1920.78 → 1921.62] and he says,
[1921.98 → 1922.46] no.
[1922.96 → 1923.22] Why?
[1923.54 → 1925.20] Because there are some folk
[1925.20 → 1926.84] who struggle with this
[1926.84 → 1927.98] and it would bring them
[1927.98 → 1929.16] back to their temples
[1929.16 → 1930.82] and they'd get sucked back
[1930.82 → 1932.32] into idolatrous worship
[1932.32 → 1933.64] and temple prostitution
[1933.64 → 1935.00] and all kinds of things here.
[1935.24 → 1937.02] So no for their sake.
[1937.02 → 1944.72] for the good of the community
[1944.72 → 1946.76] so they don't get sucked back
[1946.76 → 1947.30] into slavery.
[1947.90 → 1948.36] And Paul says,
[1948.44 → 1949.26] you're in the same place
[1949.26 → 1949.66] that the people
[1949.66 → 1950.40] that are in the wilderness.
[1950.80 → 1951.44] You're waiting.
[1951.90 → 1952.72] Moses is waiting
[1952.72 → 1953.20] in the wilderness
[1953.20 → 1954.08] for the promised land.
[1954.36 → 1955.30] The Corinthians and us
[1955.30 → 1955.70] are waiting
[1955.70 → 1956.68] for the fruition,
[1956.84 → 1957.82] the fulfillment of the kingdom.
[1958.12 → 1958.52] It's here,
[1958.62 → 1959.36] but it's not yet.
[1959.64 → 1961.04] And all things are being made right,
[1961.12 → 1962.32] but we're not all the way there yet.
[1962.90 → 1963.94] And Paul is saying
[1963.94 → 1964.90] to what he says
[1964.90 → 1966.32] is the knowledgeable Corinthians,
[1966.70 → 1968.24] which I think is somewhat code
[1968.24 → 1970.78] for the know-it-all Corinthians,
[1971.72 → 1975.58] who are concerned
[1975.58 → 1977.50] about their rightness.
[1978.78 → 1979.50] Paul is saying,
[1979.58 → 1980.98] yeah, you are right,
[1982.56 → 1984.32] but care about those
[1984.32 → 1984.90] who are struggling
[1984.90 → 1985.70] with this anyway.
[1989.26 → 1990.50] Here's the thing.
[1990.50 → 1992.66] We can make our rightness
[1992.66 → 1993.76] idolatrous.
[1997.26 → 1997.66] Right?
[1999.02 → 2000.12] We can make our rightness.
[2000.12 → 2000.94] I'm right.
[2001.86 → 2004.08] I don't give a hoot about you.
[2004.98 → 2005.74] And I'm right.
[2008.14 → 2009.10] I'm not saying we shouldn't
[2009.10 → 2010.10] try to be right, by the way.
[2010.62 → 2011.86] We should seek righteousness
[2011.86 → 2013.62] with a great sense of humility
[2013.62 → 2014.54] and a great sense
[2014.54 → 2015.40] of loving one another.
[2015.72 → 2016.72] Notice the heart of the law
[2016.72 → 2017.22] was what?
[2017.26 → 2017.98] That you love one another.
[2018.58 → 2020.48] If it's not leading you there,
[2020.50 → 2021.64] you're off base.
[2023.20 → 2024.04] Paul is saying,
[2024.46 → 2026.62] remember our ancestors.
[2026.82 → 2028.44] They were all slaves.
[2028.56 → 2030.12] They all needed saving.
[2030.50 → 2031.68] They were all freed
[2031.68 → 2032.72] and delivered by God.
[2032.72 → 2037.88] And that's why Paul says
[2037.88 → 2038.70] to all of them,
[2038.78 → 2039.82] including the know-it-alls,
[2040.22 → 2042.08] be careful when you think
[2042.08 → 2043.64] you're standing firm
[2043.64 → 2045.22] because you're on the point
[2045.22 → 2047.32] where you can fall too.
[2049.20 → 2050.66] So don't get cocky.
[2054.56 → 2055.84] Be aware of how easily
[2055.84 → 2056.64] you can fall.
[2056.78 → 2057.72] Be aware of how prone
[2057.72 → 2058.84] you are making idols.
[2059.24 → 2060.52] Be aware of how much influence
[2060.52 → 2061.44] the culture has on you.
[2061.44 → 2062.76] And I'm not knocking
[2062.76 → 2063.76] everything about culture.
[2063.88 → 2064.78] Don't hear that.
[2065.36 → 2065.98] I'm talking about
[2065.98 → 2066.74] the negative influences
[2066.74 → 2067.14] of culture.
[2067.26 → 2067.94] There are a lot of good things
[2067.94 → 2068.72] about culture too.
[2069.20 → 2069.72] So let's not go
[2069.72 → 2070.54] to that place either.
[2072.08 → 2073.16] And why do we do this?
[2073.62 → 2075.28] If you don't see your idols,
[2075.90 → 2077.18] and hear me well,
[2077.92 → 2079.22] a lot of us don't see our idols.
[2080.38 → 2081.80] If you don't see your idols,
[2082.46 → 2083.98] how do you flee from them?
[2083.98 → 2085.98] How do you flee from them?
[2088.98 → 2090.08] How do you flee from them?
[2092.82 → 2094.12] And this tendency
[2094.12 → 2095.94] plagued Israel,
[2096.26 → 2097.60] the Bible making plagued Israel
[2097.60 → 2098.50] throughout their history.
[2098.86 → 2100.04] Yeah, they built the golden calf,
[2100.24 → 2101.86] but next was Baal worship.
[2102.34 → 2102.98] And then the gods
[2102.98 → 2103.94] of the surrounding nations.
[2104.38 → 2104.84] Later on,
[2104.88 → 2107.00] when Israel splits into Judah
[2107.00 → 2108.18] and then the ten tribes,
[2108.28 → 2110.06] the ten tribes fall into
[2110.06 → 2111.52] golden calf worship.
[2111.52 → 2113.04] They set up the golden calf
[2113.04 → 2115.02] in Beth city of Bethel and Dan
[2115.02 → 2115.50] and say,
[2115.68 → 2116.46] you don't have to go
[2116.46 → 2116.98] to the temple.
[2117.24 → 2118.32] You can go to these cities.
[2118.60 → 2119.72] Look it, there's Yahweh.
[2119.96 → 2121.26] And it's the same sin.
[2127.14 → 2127.58] Parents,
[2128.84 → 2129.26] grandparents,
[2130.30 → 2131.50] be aware of
[2131.50 → 2133.24] your idol-making tendencies
[2133.24 → 2134.68] because you're modelling
[2134.68 → 2135.70] those things.
[2141.52 → 2142.90] They show up later.
[2151.96 → 2153.22] Jesus came to show us
[2153.22 → 2153.98] how life works,
[2154.56 → 2155.72] to bring us forever
[2155.72 → 2156.58] out of slavery
[2156.58 → 2157.56] through the cross,
[2157.96 → 2158.76] the only way to freedom,
[2159.64 → 2160.70] so that we could then
[2160.70 → 2161.34] be empowered,
[2161.88 → 2162.78] not by our strength,
[2162.84 → 2163.70] because that's not going to work,
[2163.98 → 2164.62] but by the power
[2164.62 → 2165.46] of the Holy Spirit
[2165.46 → 2167.24] because we are inadequate
[2167.24 → 2168.26] in our own strength.
[2168.66 → 2169.90] We need more than ourselves.
[2169.90 → 2171.28] And that's why
[2171.28 → 2172.56] in Romans 7, 6,
[2172.68 → 2173.54] Paul writes this,
[2174.52 → 2175.22] but now,
[2175.98 → 2178.14] by doing what once
[2178.14 → 2179.28] bound us,
[2180.40 → 2180.92] that's law.
[2181.52 → 2182.64] How does it bind us?
[2182.70 → 2183.88] Well, we don't seem
[2183.88 → 2184.82] to be able to keep it.
[2185.18 → 2186.12] By doing what once
[2186.12 → 2186.52] bound us,
[2186.72 → 2187.78] we have been released
[2187.78 → 2188.52] from the law.
[2188.60 → 2188.74] Why?
[2188.80 → 2189.48] Because the law didn't matter?
[2189.56 → 2190.72] No, we couldn't keep it.
[2191.52 → 2192.92] It was the best way to live.
[2194.32 → 2196.10] We serve in a new way,
[2196.22 → 2197.10] the way of the Spirit,
[2197.26 → 2198.36] empowered by the Spirit.
[2198.36 → 2200.54] Not in the old way
[2200.54 → 2202.62] written of the written code.
[2207.46 → 2208.52] Grace frees us,
[2208.58 → 2209.72] the Spirit empowers us,
[2209.96 → 2211.80] so that we can then
[2211.80 → 2212.74] be that blessing
[2212.74 → 2213.60] to the world
[2213.60 → 2215.28] that God intended
[2215.28 → 2217.06] way back to Abraham
[2217.06 → 2218.24] when he gave the promise,
[2218.74 → 2219.98] and the promise to Israel
[2219.98 → 2220.90] and the promise to us
[2220.90 → 2221.52] that we could be
[2221.52 → 2222.42] a blessing to all nations.
[2222.74 → 2223.92] And then we follow Jesus
[2223.92 → 2225.22] and we follow him alone
[2225.22 → 2227.26] and we stay very culturally
[2227.26 → 2228.22] aware of where we're
[2228.22 → 2229.00] being messed up
[2229.00 → 2230.34] and then we lead others
[2230.34 → 2230.62] where?
[2230.88 → 2231.82] To Jesus.
[2231.82 → 2236.30] And we lead them
[2236.30 → 2237.36] to discover the fullness
[2237.36 → 2237.94] of Jesus
[2237.94 → 2239.10] and we admit
[2239.10 → 2239.86] we don't have
[2239.86 → 2241.44] a complete understanding
[2241.44 → 2241.66] of that.
[2241.72 → 2242.66] We're striving for it too
[2242.66 → 2243.34] and that's why we study
[2243.34 → 2244.14] our Bibles together
[2244.14 → 2244.74] and that's why we have
[2244.74 → 2245.34] small groups
[2245.34 → 2247.12] and that's why we work together
[2247.12 → 2247.78] as a community
[2247.78 → 2249.42] to try to help each other
[2249.42 → 2251.26] walk in the path of truth
[2251.26 → 2252.66] because we tend to
[2252.66 → 2255.04] misunderstand it sometime
[2255.04 → 2256.32] and we need each other.
[2259.64 → 2261.02] And then we lead others
[2261.02 → 2261.44] to Jesus,
[2261.54 → 2262.06] our families,
[2262.20 → 2262.58] our friends,
[2262.66 → 2263.10] our communities,
[2263.26 → 2263.76] our world.
[2264.76 → 2265.48] And I'm just going to
[2265.48 → 2266.54] close with one quote.
[2268.20 → 2269.08] One more quote.
[2269.92 → 2270.86] Let me read it to you.
[2271.94 → 2272.66] It says this,
[2273.54 → 2274.74] It's too easy
[2274.74 → 2276.92] for folks to assume
[2276.92 → 2278.38] their own expertise
[2278.38 → 2280.58] and to rush ahead
[2280.58 → 2281.40] toward accomplishments
[2281.40 → 2282.96] without waiting
[2282.96 → 2283.76] for God's guidance.
[2283.76 → 2285.58] It's too easy
[2285.58 → 2286.52] for congregations
[2286.52 → 2287.04] and governments
[2287.04 → 2287.68] to act quickly
[2287.68 → 2289.08] upon a promising idea
[2289.08 → 2290.12] without asking
[2290.12 → 2290.80] the hard questions
[2290.80 → 2291.42] about God's will
[2291.42 → 2292.10] for the project.
[2292.74 → 2293.66] It's too easy
[2293.66 → 2294.48] for people to make
[2294.48 → 2295.14] the most important
[2295.14 → 2295.98] life decisions,
[2296.40 → 2297.36] marriage, calling,
[2297.54 → 2298.46] career, family
[2298.46 → 2299.64] without bringing God
[2299.64 → 2300.46] into the conversation.
[2301.34 → 2302.10] It's sometimes
[2302.10 → 2302.72] too easy
[2302.72 → 2306.10] to be just like Aaron.
[2310.04 → 2311.22] Let us have
[2311.22 → 2313.28] no other gods.
[2313.76 → 2315.60] And let us be
[2315.60 → 2316.58] deeply aware
[2316.58 → 2318.38] of the distortions
[2318.38 → 2319.96] we have created.
[2322.02 → 2323.26] And then let us
[2323.26 → 2324.06] walk together
[2324.06 → 2325.46] with grace
[2325.46 → 2327.48] and with humility,
[2328.42 → 2329.78] longing deeply
[2329.78 → 2331.20] with the power
[2331.20 → 2331.84] of the Holy Spirit
[2331.84 → 2332.24] and the guidance
[2332.24 → 2332.98] of God's word
[2332.98 → 2335.12] to find His truth
[2335.12 → 2336.36] and then live
[2336.36 → 2337.10] in that truth,
[2337.36 → 2338.58] the truth that sets
[2338.58 → 2339.84] us free.
[2339.84 → 2340.84] Amen.
[2340.84 → 2342.08] Amen.
[2345.50 → 2346.72] Let's pray.
[2350.72 → 2352.04] Father God,
[2352.04 → 2360.94] we long
[2360.94 → 2363.08] to know the depth
[2363.08 → 2363.50] of you
[2363.50 → 2366.54] and you so long
[2366.54 → 2367.56] to reveal yourself
[2367.56 → 2368.24] to us.
[2368.42 → 2369.22] Lord, may we just
[2369.22 → 2370.38] walk faithfully
[2370.38 → 2371.90] in the knowledge
[2371.90 → 2373.22] that you are God,
[2373.92 → 2375.26] that you reveal
[2375.26 → 2376.32] yourself to us
[2376.32 → 2377.02] through your word,
[2377.16 → 2377.88] through your spirit,
[2377.88 → 2379.42] and that our job
[2379.42 → 2380.22] is to humbly
[2380.22 → 2380.70] follow,
[2381.40 → 2382.44] to grow as we
[2382.44 → 2383.12] can through the
[2383.12 → 2383.46] spirit,
[2384.02 → 2384.88] to grow as we
