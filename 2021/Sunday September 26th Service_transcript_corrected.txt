[0.00 → 7.60] Well, it is a privilege week after week for us to dwell in the scriptures together,
[7.80 → 10.98] and we're going to continue our series on servanthood as well.
[11.40 → 15.28] We started two weeks ago looking at how Jesus is our model for servanthood as he washes his
[15.28 → 16.00] disciples' feet.
[16.58 → 20.94] Last week, Pastor Sid opened up what it looks like to be a servant leader, and this morning
[20.94 → 24.62] we're going to look at the way in which we're called to serve with our gifts in the body
[24.62 → 25.14] of Christ.
[25.58 → 29.34] And so if you have your Bibles, turn with me to Romans 12, or if you have your Bible
[29.34 → 31.34] on your phone, you can scroll with me to Romans 12.
[32.02 → 34.18] The first two verses, you'll recognize those.
[34.28 → 36.92] That's something I've even preached on in the last couple of months, but we're going to look
[36.92 → 41.34] at the last part of this and where Paul moves after he talks about what it means to be living
[41.34 → 42.12] sacrifices.
[42.72 → 44.16] So let's read Romans 12 together.
[49.16 → 55.58] Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies
[55.58 → 59.88] as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God.
[60.26 → 61.52] This is true worship.
[62.86 → 67.60] Do not conform to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[68.54 → 73.84] Then you'll be able to test and approve what God's will is, his good, his pleasing, and perfect
[73.84 → 74.20] will.
[74.20 → 80.00] For by the grace given me, I say to every one of you, do not think of yourself more
[80.00 → 84.90] highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment in accordance
[84.90 → 87.18] with the faith that God has distributed to each of you.
[87.84 → 92.22] For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have
[92.22 → 97.32] the same function, so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs
[97.32 → 98.18] to all the others.
[98.80 → 102.08] We have different gifts according to the grace given to each of us.
[102.08 → 106.64] If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith.
[107.26 → 108.90] If it's serving, then serve.
[109.40 → 111.32] If it's teaching, then teach.
[111.78 → 113.50] If it's to encourage, then give encouragement.
[113.90 → 115.78] If it's giving, then give generously.
[116.54 → 118.38] If it is to lead, do it diligently.
[119.00 → 121.86] And if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully.
[121.86 → 131.70] Well, a few years ago, I was introduced to this concept that helped me understand my family
[131.70 → 134.88] a little bit, and the concept is tall poppy syndrome.
[135.68 → 137.04] Has anyone heard of that concept before?
[138.30 → 141.78] As I had come to know tall poppy syndrome, this is how it operates.
[142.34 → 146.74] If someone in your circle or your family is a little bit puffed up, they like to talk about
[146.74 → 152.44] themselves a little bit self-centred and self-elevating, it is the responsibility of the family or the
[152.44 → 155.04] wider circle of friends to chop them down to size.
[157.30 → 158.96] And I happen to have a family that does that.
[159.06 → 162.54] And of course, the image is you have a field of poppies, and if one's way above the rest
[162.54 → 166.06] of the poppies, the rest just chop it right down to where it belongs with the rest of them.
[166.88 → 169.20] And it looks different in different ways, right?
[169.54 → 172.94] Perhaps someone is boasting about their accomplishments at work.
[172.94 → 178.12] Perhaps they're telling you how many followers they have on social media, or just how above
[178.12 → 182.30] average their kids are, which of course secretly means that they as parents are above average.
[182.92 → 186.90] It then falls to the family and close friends to chop them down to size.
[188.68 → 193.06] In my extended family, I have a relative who would often take that responsibility.
[194.22 → 197.80] And he had this phrase he would use if he felt someone else was talking just a little bit
[197.80 → 200.38] too much about themselves and their gifts and what they've done.
[200.38 → 203.28] And he would say, oh, enough about me.
[203.84 → 205.10] What do you think about me?
[207.10 → 208.66] Poppy sufficiently chopped.
[209.54 → 211.84] Of course, it was a phrase intended to humble.
[213.40 → 215.78] Paul does something similar to this in our passage.
[215.92 → 217.00] We're going to open that up in just a minute.
[217.06 → 220.14] But he does it in a healthier, much more biblical way.
[220.70 → 224.40] He wants to remind the church of what they've been called to do.
[225.12 → 229.44] In fact, you'll notice that right on the heels of saying that the whole of the Christian
[229.44 → 234.22] life is to be poured out as a living sacrifice, that they are not to be formed by the cultural
[234.22 → 236.60] mould, but be transformed by the renewing of their minds.
[236.70 → 241.58] The first thing Paul says after that is, serve with humility.
[242.78 → 245.02] Do not think you are more than you are.
[245.58 → 250.04] Recognize that God gave you gifts to serve the body of Christ.
[250.92 → 254.86] That's the first thing he says after what it means to be a living sacrifice.
[254.86 → 259.30] And the subtext, I think, is fairly clear.
[259.40 → 263.12] I think the cultural mould in Rome is not that different in some ways than now.
[263.76 → 267.80] The mould then was if you have power, use it to your benefit.
[268.00 → 272.68] If you have a position of influence, talk about your high esteem privileges, right?
[272.70 → 276.38] If you have gifts, make sure you benefit from all the things that you can do.
[276.72 → 280.72] And cutting right through all of that, Paul writes, for by the grace given me, I say to
[280.72 → 285.30] every one of you, Roman church, do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but
[285.30 → 291.40] think of yourself with sober judgment in accordance with the faith that God has distributed to each
[291.40 → 291.78] of you.
[293.30 → 294.34] Sober judgment.
[296.28 → 300.66] Honest self-assessment according to the faith that God has given us.
[300.68 → 303.40] That's what Paul is inviting the church to live with.
[303.62 → 306.76] A posture of honesty about one's gift.
[306.86 → 309.28] A posture of honesty about where we are in Christ.
[309.28 → 313.66] And I love how William Barclay, I'll quote him in just a minute, he says how this cuts
[313.66 → 318.30] against or pushes against overstating our gifts and our significance in the body, but
[318.30 → 323.68] also downplaying and understating and even self-deprecating our gifts within the body of
[323.68 → 323.92] Christ.
[324.00 → 329.98] He writes, we do not get very far in this world until we know what we can and what we cannot
[329.98 → 330.64] do.
[331.48 → 337.58] An honest assessment of our own capabilities without conceit and without false modesty is
[337.58 → 340.70] one of the first essentials of a useful life.
[341.36 → 342.46] I'm going to come back to that.
[343.86 → 345.58] This though is all part of a bigger teaching.
[345.80 → 350.68] In fact, a bit of a famous teaching of Paul's where he describes what the church is.
[351.08 → 355.46] Here and in Corinthians, perhaps more famously 1 Corinthians 12, Paul talks about the church
[355.46 → 357.98] as the body of Christ, right?
[357.98 → 362.42] And the images of Jesus being the head and all these different limbs and organisms with
[362.42 → 366.70] different functions and different places in the body, all sort of being unified together
[366.70 → 367.86] in the body.
[368.08 → 369.44] I'll read it for you again.
[369.52 → 370.30] This is verse 4.
[370.94 → 375.64] He writes, for just as each of us has a body with many members and each member does not have
[375.64 → 382.56] the same function, so in Christ we thought many form one body and each member belongs to
[382.56 → 382.94] the other.
[382.94 → 388.30] Now, I could preach a whole sermon on just that verse, but I want to highlight just a
[388.30 → 389.18] few things about it.
[389.48 → 395.28] Number one, we need to realize that for Paul, when you believe in Jesus, you get the church.
[396.06 → 398.72] You don't get Jesus without the family of faith.
[398.82 → 404.44] To be baptized into the family or to become new members in the family is to join a whole
[404.44 → 406.30] group of people called the church.
[406.30 → 412.62] And it's only in the individualized West, which we all live in, that we can conceive
[412.62 → 415.24] of our faith as just between me and Jesus, right?
[415.52 → 420.06] We sort of see ourselves having a personal relationship with Jesus, and it's segregated and sort of compartmentalized
[420.06 → 422.74] from the body, the brothers and sisters who share your faith.
[423.70 → 425.00] But that's not how Paul sees it.
[425.64 → 428.82] For him to be a Christian is to be part of the body.
[429.66 → 433.82] As one of my friends put it quite crassly, sometimes Western people want to try to pull the
[433.82 → 436.44] head off the body and be in relationship with Jesus without the family.
[436.56 → 437.86] But that's not how it works.
[438.38 → 441.48] To be in Christ is to be grafted into the family.
[442.78 → 444.38] Do you see your own faith that way?
[445.66 → 448.26] Do we see ourselves as grafted into a family?
[449.84 → 453.76] And Paul knew, even as writing Romans and many of his other letters, that that's going to be
[453.76 → 459.34] the hard work of the church, to live as brothers and sisters, to recognize that now they belong
[459.34 → 461.22] to this thing called the church community.
[461.22 → 465.30] And for him, it was hard because there were Romans in the church, which is probably the
[465.30 → 466.70] majority of the church in this time.
[467.38 → 468.80] They had a way of growing up.
[468.90 → 471.36] They had a way of thinking and living and celebrations.
[471.60 → 474.98] Then there's this other part of the church, probably the smaller part, which is the Jews.
[475.72 → 477.44] And they lived in a bit more of a subculture.
[477.58 → 481.14] They had the law, a little more strict of an upbringing, an understanding of the world.
[481.22 → 482.20] They sort of kept to themselves.
[482.64 → 487.16] And now these Romans, you might say these secular rough and tumble Romans, are now in family
[487.16 → 489.02] with these conservative Jews.
[489.02 → 490.64] And they got to figure that out.
[491.56 → 494.66] And that's not even to mention all the other differences in the church, right?
[495.22 → 496.88] There were the Jews, the Gentiles.
[497.16 → 499.98] There were the wealthy, the poor, the slaves and the slave owners.
[500.12 → 502.24] Can you just imagine that for a minute, being in the same church?
[502.36 → 505.02] Slaves, slave owners, men, women, children, adults.
[505.24 → 509.48] All of those differences, they had to learn how to be family in the midst of.
[509.48 → 518.72] And Paul wants them to know, you are, with all your differences and all your gifts, the body of Christ.
[519.62 → 523.34] But what I want to underscore today, and I probably wouldn't have underscored this as much in other sermons,
[523.70 → 528.14] but I want to underscore how Paul emphasizes that what unifies the body is not their ethnicity,
[528.56 → 531.84] it's not what they eat, it's not who they hang out with, not their social status, none of that,
[531.94 → 535.50] except for their faith in Jesus as Lord and Saviour.
[535.50 → 539.46] That's what brings them together, that's what makes them distinct from other social clubs,
[539.72 → 542.62] it's faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour.
[542.88 → 543.48] That's it.
[544.78 → 547.32] It's not their political convictions, I should add.
[548.24 → 551.28] And thank goodness, because I know that there are couples in our church who voted for different parties.
[552.10 → 556.32] Some of you probably nullified your own spouse's party in your vote, which is so annoying.
[556.72 → 558.08] But that's not what makes us the church.
[558.08 → 564.78] Dare I even add, even how you feel about masks and vaccines is not what defines whether you are bodily the Christ.
[565.50 → 566.46] Do you know that?
[567.54 → 573.08] What unifies and binds and forges the church together as brothers and sisters is the gospel.
[574.50 → 577.86] Jesus Christ died and raised, making sense of the entire biblical story.
[578.10 → 579.08] That's why we gather.
[579.54 → 581.60] That's what makes us brothers and sisters.
[582.62 → 587.66] And I feel like in this season, where there's a high degree of divisiveness, we need to recognize that.
[587.66 → 594.64] In fact, I think I've prayed more about the unity of church in the last number of months than I've ever prayed before for the unity of the church.
[594.68 → 598.04] Not just our own local church, but for the churches in the city and in our world right now,
[598.30 → 602.08] which experience all the turbulence and division that our cities are experiencing.
[602.08 → 612.16] What I love about this passage is that when Paul talks about the diversity of the church, he sees it as a gift.
[613.20 → 614.64] He knows it's hard, of course.
[614.72 → 616.30] He knows that Jews and Gentiles have to get along.
[616.40 → 617.48] They have to learn how to be family.
[617.58 → 619.52] They have to learn to love one another and bear with one another.
[619.62 → 621.06] And Sid's going to talk about that next week.
[621.06 → 626.82] But he realizes that the church needs diversity if it's going to be healthy and thrive as the body.
[627.62 → 631.38] If you read 1 Corinthians 12, which is sort of a co-text to this one,
[631.72 → 636.80] this is where Paul talks about how if the whole body were one piece, what a mess that body would be.
[636.88 → 638.22] How boring that body would be.
[638.26 → 640.44] How ineffective that body would be, right?
[641.12 → 644.00] If the whole body were just the preacher, we'd be in trouble.
[645.26 → 647.12] You know, a pastor friend of mine once said,
[647.12 → 650.82] if the whole body were just the speaker at the front, it'd be like a T. rex.
[651.58 → 655.56] A giant mouth speaking all the time, but tiny little hands that can't do anything.
[656.50 → 657.88] We don't want a church like that.
[659.08 → 660.68] Or, you know, as someone else once put it,
[660.70 → 663.56] if the whole body were European, where would the sense of joy be?
[664.62 → 667.02] And just to honour Joe, our Nigerian brother who led prayer,
[667.08 → 669.56] if the whole body were Nigerian, where would the sense of time be?
[672.26 → 676.48] Paul recognizes that we need the diversity of the body to be a healthy body.
[676.48 → 680.92] We need to live in what I might describe as a healthy mutual interdependence.
[682.02 → 683.18] With all these different parts.
[683.26 → 684.64] And that's why he says, the whole body was an eye.
[684.70 → 685.46] Where would the hearing be?
[685.52 → 686.38] The whole body were an ear.
[686.44 → 687.32] Where would the smell be?
[687.50 → 691.32] We need all the different parts of the body to be a healthy community.
[693.20 → 696.14] Listen to what Paul says in the next two verses, verse 5 and 6.
[696.22 → 696.56] He writes,
[696.56 → 709.18] And before I say anything about the list that Paul makes of gifts,
[709.40 → 710.56] did you notice what he said there?
[710.68 → 712.64] We all have different gifts, and not just that,
[713.10 → 715.66] but gifts according to the grace given to each of us.
[716.26 → 720.10] That is to say, whatever you're good at, whatever gifting you have,
[720.46 → 721.98] whatever things you find natural and easy,
[721.98 → 723.68] that other people find difficult and frustrating,
[724.10 → 726.94] that's God's goodness and generosity to you.
[728.50 → 729.70] God says, you're welcome.
[730.60 → 731.48] You have these gifts.
[731.66 → 732.74] I've given them to you.
[732.78 → 735.40] They are a result of my grace in your life.
[735.44 → 736.00] And guess what?
[736.66 → 737.42] They're not for you.
[737.54 → 739.48] They're for serving in humility the body of Christ
[739.48 → 740.54] and the city in which you live.
[740.94 → 741.94] That's why you have them.
[742.26 → 742.76] You're welcome.
[742.76 → 749.34] Different gifts, different abilities, all equally important.
[750.60 → 752.42] And a challenge that I think faces churches today
[752.42 → 754.46] and the churches in the first century was
[754.46 → 756.88] elevating some gifts with arrogance
[756.88 → 759.44] or downplaying your own gifts
[759.44 → 761.38] and thinking you are less than
[761.38 → 763.54] because you don't have the gifts of that person or another.
[764.66 → 766.00] And, you know, I've been around church,
[766.06 → 767.64] and I think some of you have been around church long enough
[767.64 → 769.90] to know that there are subtle ways that we express this.
[770.54 → 772.68] You know, oh, if only I could lead worship.
[773.42 → 774.58] I have a terrible voice.
[774.66 → 775.40] I can't do that.
[776.14 → 778.10] If only I could lead youth, but youth make me nervous.
[778.18 → 778.82] I can't do that.
[778.94 → 780.06] That's not my skill set.
[780.36 → 783.10] Or I wish I had the fancy gift of prophecy
[783.10 → 785.26] or speaking in tongues or healing
[785.26 → 788.18] and not the boring gifts of serving and hospitality.
[788.94 → 790.72] I want something exciting and exotic.
[791.50 → 793.74] And all these comparisons that we have between each other
[793.74 → 796.64] and all the envy we might have of other people's gifts,
[797.12 → 798.78] underneath that is a subtle sense of
[798.78 → 801.24] I don't really have much to bring to the table.
[802.24 → 804.30] My gifts aren't really that needed in this community.
[805.74 → 807.26] And a story that comes to mind
[807.26 → 809.50] that was shared with me a number of years ago
[809.50 → 812.50] was from a friend who, in his young adult years,
[812.54 → 813.88] was invited to a Christian conference.
[814.18 → 815.14] And at this time in his life,
[815.20 → 816.36] he was just sorting out his faith,
[816.44 → 817.74] trying to figure out what he believed,
[817.82 → 819.32] and he was intrigued by Christianity.
[819.82 → 821.38] And he went to this charismatic conference
[821.38 → 822.96] where, during this service,
[823.08 → 824.58] they invited all the people up to the stage
[824.58 → 826.14] to pray for them that they would receive
[826.14 → 827.24] the gift of the Holy Spirit
[827.24 → 828.52] and speak in tongues.
[829.18 → 830.80] So my friend's like, that sounds amazing.
[830.96 → 832.54] So he comes up to the front, to the stage,
[832.58 → 833.36] and one of the pastors there
[833.36 → 834.72] places their hand on his chest,
[834.94 → 835.88] and they pray for him
[835.88 → 837.72] that he would receive the gift of the Spirit,
[837.80 → 838.70] that he would speak in tongues.
[838.78 → 839.26] And guess what?
[840.44 → 841.12] Nothing happened.
[842.32 → 844.14] And the pastor was probably concerned by this
[844.14 → 844.88] because he did it again.
[844.96 → 845.80] He's praying for him,
[845.96 → 847.10] and still nothing happened.
[847.16 → 848.72] It was like Benny Hind gone wrong, right?
[848.72 → 849.82] It was an awkward situation.
[850.16 → 853.02] And eventually, this guy makes his way back to the seat,
[853.08 → 854.82] and this is how he describes the situation to me.
[854.88 → 855.78] He sits down, he says,
[856.08 → 858.30] I guess there's nothing here for me.
[859.68 → 861.00] I guess there's nothing here for me.
[861.06 → 862.46] There's lots of stuff going on with other people,
[862.58 → 863.70] but there's nothing here for me.
[863.76 → 864.62] I'm not speaking in tongues.
[864.76 → 866.42] I don't have this amazing reception
[866.42 → 867.88] and response to the Holy Spirit.
[869.16 → 870.46] And it took him decades
[870.46 → 873.74] to realize that God had so much in store for him.
[874.58 → 875.64] It just wasn't tongues.
[877.38 → 879.22] We need to recognize that all of us
[879.22 → 879.94] have been gifted
[879.94 → 882.82] in very important ways.
[883.28 → 885.10] No one's gift is less important.
[885.56 → 887.80] No one's place is insignificant.
[888.46 → 889.28] Everyone matters.
[892.92 → 894.46] And I think we also need to name,
[894.58 → 895.46] if that's one extreme,
[895.62 → 896.90] sort of devaluing
[896.90 → 898.10] and almost self-deprecating
[898.10 → 899.04] our place in the body,
[899.44 → 901.96] it's also sensing that
[901.96 → 903.40] some gifts are more important than others.
[903.70 → 904.76] Or maybe the gift you have
[904.76 → 906.24] is more important than other gifts.
[906.28 → 907.08] You might not ever say it,
[907.10 → 907.84] but you might think it,
[907.86 → 909.58] or you might live as though that were true.
[909.58 → 910.54] And for Paul,
[911.16 → 913.04] there's no place for the self-sufficient person
[913.04 → 913.60] in a church.
[914.44 → 915.26] There's no place for someone
[915.26 → 916.68] who thinks they have everything in themselves
[916.68 → 918.12] to grow and live and flourish
[918.12 → 918.86] and bless the city.
[919.00 → 920.16] There's no place for the sort of
[920.16 → 921.62] individual capable person
[921.62 → 923.58] all on their own in the body of Christ.
[923.92 → 926.28] We need every other member.
[926.80 → 927.44] We need them.
[927.98 → 928.90] We need the children
[928.90 → 930.24] who just went up to Cornerstone.
[931.04 → 931.98] In fact, I read this week
[931.98 → 932.94] of a person saying
[932.94 → 934.14] oftentimes people volunteer
[934.14 → 935.06] for children's ministry
[935.06 → 936.22] thinking, oh, you know,
[936.26 → 937.04] I'll help out the church,
[937.12 → 938.02] I'll take one for the team,
[938.02 → 939.48] and I'll go hold those babies in nursery
[939.48 → 940.68] whose diapers need to be changed.
[940.94 → 941.78] But it turns out,
[942.56 → 944.16] often as the Spirit works
[944.16 → 945.10] and we serve in these ministries,
[945.18 → 947.40] we realize we need those children.
[948.40 → 950.60] They have so much to teach us about trust.
[951.34 → 952.96] They have so much to teach us about faith.
[953.50 → 955.26] They have so much to teach us about joy.
[955.72 → 956.96] And when we serve in these ministries,
[957.08 → 958.18] we receive the gift
[958.18 → 959.72] that those children are to us.
[960.04 → 961.18] And so it is with these children
[961.18 → 962.40] who are here for the Cornerstone Grad.
[962.60 → 963.58] We need them.
[963.94 → 964.62] Do you know that?
[964.62 → 966.74] You know, one of the stories
[966.74 → 967.90] that comes to my mind,
[967.96 → 968.74] I find it quite moving
[968.74 → 969.66] when I think about it,
[970.32 → 971.54] is one is in my previous church.
[972.56 → 974.08] After preaching, I lost my Bible,
[974.20 → 974.92] which is, by the way,
[975.00 → 975.64] some of you know this,
[975.66 → 976.80] I lose my Bible all the time.
[976.84 → 977.88] So if you see this Bible,
[978.30 → 979.22] just return it to me.
[979.30 → 979.88] I actually have two
[979.88 → 981.04] of the exact same Bible,
[981.38 → 982.24] so that if I lose one,
[982.30 → 983.08] I find the other one.
[984.06 → 984.76] But I happen to be looking
[984.76 → 985.66] for my Bible in the kitchen
[985.66 → 986.56] of my previous church.
[986.92 → 987.88] And while looking for it,
[987.88 → 988.46] I was in the kitchen,
[988.66 → 989.32] I see Simon.
[990.04 → 991.18] Simon's a 14-year-old boy
[991.18 → 991.94] with Down syndrome,
[992.44 → 993.80] part of our youth group at the time.
[994.40 → 995.06] And Simon happened
[995.06 → 996.28] to be moving around the kitchen
[996.28 → 996.70] and moving around
[996.70 → 997.62] the whole fellowship hall,
[997.72 → 999.10] and he's collecting all the cups
[999.10 → 1000.20] and all the mugs
[1000.20 → 1001.16] that people were finished with
[1001.16 → 1001.72] that just, you know,
[1001.76 → 1002.64] rest all over the place.
[1002.96 → 1003.92] And he was dutifully
[1003.92 → 1005.06] and he was joyfully
[1005.06 → 1006.32] placing them in the dishwasher.
[1006.94 → 1007.68] And on his way over
[1007.68 → 1008.32] to the dishwasher,
[1008.44 → 1009.64] he just gives me a hug.
[1010.24 → 1010.76] And of course,
[1011.12 → 1011.58] all of a sudden,
[1011.64 → 1012.54] I'm able just to see
[1012.54 → 1013.12] what he's doing
[1013.12 → 1013.94] and see who he is
[1013.94 → 1014.56] in our church.
[1014.98 → 1016.06] And I wonder now,
[1016.14 → 1017.12] looking back on that,
[1017.90 → 1019.10] could it be that Simon
[1019.10 → 1020.56] is more faithfully serving
[1020.56 → 1021.22] with his gifts,
[1021.46 → 1022.58] more faithfully serving
[1022.58 → 1023.24] with his gifts,
[1023.72 → 1025.00] than so many of us
[1025.00 → 1026.12] week after week
[1026.12 → 1026.62] in the church?
[1027.36 → 1028.80] And even more to the point,
[1029.56 → 1030.60] do we know how much
[1030.60 → 1032.58] we need Simon?
[1033.18 → 1034.68] Do you know how much
[1034.68 → 1036.06] you need Simon in the church?
[1037.02 → 1038.18] And everyone likes Simon
[1038.18 → 1039.84] in all sorts of ways.
[1039.84 → 1044.36] The church is designed
[1044.36 → 1046.52] to live in mutual interdependence.
[1046.58 → 1047.46] You don't have all the gifts,
[1047.64 → 1048.50] I don't have all the gifts.
[1048.66 → 1050.14] We desperately need one another,
[1050.22 → 1051.44] not just to grow,
[1052.12 → 1053.04] but to serve
[1053.04 → 1054.28] and to bless the city.
[1055.26 → 1056.42] And one of my favourite experiences
[1056.42 → 1057.28] of witnessing this
[1057.28 → 1058.00] in real time
[1058.00 → 1059.34] was a few years ago
[1059.34 → 1059.86] when we formed
[1059.86 → 1061.32] our refugee sponsorship team.
[1062.12 → 1063.20] This is when our government
[1063.20 → 1063.78] was bringing in
[1063.78 → 1065.28] a number of Syrian refugees
[1065.28 → 1066.72] and our church said,
[1066.82 → 1067.32] let's do this.
[1067.38 → 1068.36] And so we formed this team
[1068.36 → 1068.88] and Melissa,
[1069.06 → 1069.58] one of the ladies
[1069.58 → 1070.32] who is helping us
[1070.32 → 1070.88] form this team,
[1070.96 → 1072.02] she said to me early on,
[1072.04 → 1072.32] she's like,
[1072.56 → 1073.72] just make sure your team
[1073.72 → 1074.78] to do this
[1074.78 → 1076.16] is diverse as possible.
[1077.08 → 1078.60] And diverse is what we got.
[1079.28 → 1080.64] We started right away
[1080.64 → 1081.62] and what we realized
[1081.62 → 1082.76] is there's a mountain
[1082.76 → 1083.50] of paperwork
[1083.50 → 1084.52] and it's not just paperwork,
[1084.66 → 1085.30] it's government,
[1085.54 → 1086.06] insane,
[1086.20 → 1088.04] bureaucratic sponsorship paperwork.
[1088.60 → 1089.86] And Jolene and Karen said,
[1090.06 → 1090.78] we'll do that.
[1091.10 → 1091.82] We can do that.
[1091.92 → 1093.40] Had no idea how hard that is.
[1093.68 → 1094.40] So they go off
[1094.40 → 1094.82] on the paperwork,
[1094.92 → 1095.52] but that's not just
[1095.52 → 1096.02] what we need.
[1096.30 → 1096.86] We need people
[1096.86 → 1097.82] who can help with housing.
[1098.36 → 1099.76] Darcy comes to the first meeting.
[1100.04 → 1101.20] He's got a breakdown of housing,
[1101.30 → 1102.14] a breakdown of rent,
[1102.40 → 1103.78] houses within five kilometres
[1103.78 → 1104.26] of our church
[1104.26 → 1104.90] that they could rent
[1104.90 → 1105.80] so they could walk to church,
[1105.90 → 1106.16] et cetera.
[1106.62 → 1107.80] Darcy's giving a gift
[1107.80 → 1108.44] to the team.
[1109.02 → 1109.90] But we needed more than that.
[1109.96 → 1111.18] Once we find a house
[1111.18 → 1112.06] for this family to live in,
[1112.08 → 1112.46] we need someone
[1112.46 → 1113.90] who can figure out internet,
[1114.04 → 1115.22] figure out Arabic TV,
[1115.78 → 1116.92] figure out all the different things
[1116.92 → 1117.94] that come with running a house.
[1118.06 → 1119.12] In comes Justin Curry,
[1119.38 → 1120.84] our resident problem solver.
[1121.34 → 1121.96] He's on it.
[1122.56 → 1123.50] But we need more than that.
[1123.96 → 1124.48] We need people
[1124.48 → 1125.70] who can drive the family.
[1125.70 → 1126.60] And in comes Luke
[1126.60 → 1127.34] and Nell
[1127.34 → 1128.64] who drove so selflessly
[1128.64 → 1129.68] and Lynn and Wayne
[1129.68 → 1130.24] who said,
[1130.38 → 1130.76] we're available,
[1130.94 → 1131.58] we're tired,
[1131.68 → 1132.30] we can be there.
[1132.34 → 1132.74] If you need someone
[1132.74 → 1133.36] to take you somewhere
[1133.36 → 1133.84] to an appointment,
[1134.06 → 1134.78] we'll drive.
[1135.50 → 1136.82] But we needed more than that.
[1137.34 → 1137.74] We need people
[1137.74 → 1138.66] who can just sit down,
[1139.74 → 1140.06] listen,
[1141.12 → 1142.52] understand what the needs are,
[1142.82 → 1143.76] schedule appointments,
[1144.48 → 1145.42] learn from them.
[1145.86 → 1147.16] And Nell and Teresa
[1147.16 → 1148.30] and the other Nell,
[1148.42 → 1148.72] that's true,
[1148.78 → 1149.76] we have two Nell's
[1149.76 → 1150.32] and two Sandy's
[1150.32 → 1150.84] on the committee
[1150.84 → 1151.56] and the family,
[1152.08 → 1152.94] our sponsor family
[1152.94 → 1153.76] still refers to them
[1153.76 → 1154.80] as Nell and the other Nell
[1154.80 → 1155.70] and then Sandy
[1155.70 → 1156.54] and the other Sandy.
[1157.42 → 1158.30] But we needed Sandy
[1158.30 → 1159.38] to help them with the finances.
[1159.54 → 1160.60] We needed the other Sandy,
[1160.70 → 1161.40] Sandy Vulcanizer,
[1161.46 → 1162.42] to help them with language
[1162.42 → 1164.38] and just be a listening partner
[1164.38 → 1165.28] and a speaking partner.
[1165.70 → 1167.10] And on and on and on
[1167.10 → 1167.88] the list could go.
[1168.14 → 1169.44] And I realized early on
[1169.44 → 1170.24] that none of us
[1170.24 → 1171.64] could do the sponsorship thing
[1171.64 → 1172.18] on our own.
[1172.54 → 1173.70] We needed all the gifts
[1173.70 → 1175.24] working interdependently
[1175.24 → 1176.24] to bring this family,
[1176.34 → 1177.28] to love this family
[1177.28 → 1178.66] and to enfold this family
[1178.66 → 1179.20] into our church
[1179.20 → 1179.78] and our city.
[1180.52 → 1181.30] And sometimes
[1181.30 → 1181.92] I just kind of
[1181.92 → 1182.74] step back from it
[1182.74 → 1183.78] and see how beautiful
[1183.78 → 1184.96] it was
[1184.96 → 1186.62] when we see all the gifts
[1186.62 → 1187.88] being deployed to bless.
[1188.86 → 1189.98] And we all secretly
[1189.98 → 1191.08] kind of knew as well
[1191.08 → 1191.80] that we had to stay
[1191.80 → 1192.38] in our lanes.
[1192.94 → 1193.78] Like everyone knew
[1193.78 → 1194.52] Dave's not going to do
[1194.52 → 1195.06] the finances.
[1196.08 → 1196.68] Dave's not going to do
[1196.68 → 1197.06] the paperwork.
[1197.18 → 1197.92] They'll never get here
[1197.92 → 1198.66] if I do the paperwork.
[1199.24 → 1199.86] And we all knew
[1199.86 → 1200.56] that Teresa probably
[1200.56 → 1201.40] didn't want to do the housing
[1201.40 → 1203.12] and every single one of us
[1203.12 → 1203.98] knew that Justin Curry
[1203.98 → 1205.10] was not doing the driving.
[1205.96 → 1206.68] And if you know Justin,
[1206.80 → 1207.10] it's like,
[1207.18 → 1208.02] hey, welcome to Canada,
[1208.14 → 1208.52] buckle up,
[1208.58 → 1209.52] this is the F1,
[1209.52 → 1210.84] or the Indy 500.
[1211.36 → 1212.48] So he didn't do the driving.
[1213.28 → 1214.66] But working interdependently
[1214.66 → 1215.70] was a beautiful sight.
[1215.78 → 1216.58] In fact, I think
[1216.58 → 1217.96] that little sponsorship team
[1217.96 → 1218.78] was a microcosm
[1218.78 → 1219.52] of how God designed
[1219.52 → 1221.10] the church to work.
[1221.52 → 1222.20] In fact, I think
[1222.20 → 1223.22] God designed the church
[1223.22 → 1224.12] to be a microcosm
[1224.12 → 1225.06] of how the whole world
[1225.06 → 1225.92] is supposed to work.
[1226.62 → 1227.46] Serving humbly,
[1227.84 → 1228.62] caring for the other,
[1228.94 → 1229.74] using the gifts
[1229.74 → 1230.40] that God has given
[1230.40 → 1231.26] to bless
[1231.26 → 1232.18] and to care
[1232.18 → 1232.80] for the needs
[1232.80 → 1233.50] of other people.
[1234.30 → 1234.94] The church is supposed
[1234.94 → 1235.62] to be a picture
[1235.62 → 1236.38] of how the world
[1236.38 → 1237.36] was meant to be.
[1237.36 → 1238.22] And the way the world
[1238.22 → 1239.32] will be
[1239.32 → 1240.72] when Jesus returns.
[1247.82 → 1248.48] I remember
[1248.48 → 1249.50] a few years ago
[1249.50 → 1250.16] talking with someone
[1250.16 → 1250.74] at the Coverdale
[1250.74 → 1251.42] Community Kitchen.
[1252.82 → 1253.60] And they were talking
[1253.60 → 1253.96] about working
[1253.96 → 1254.66] with non-profits
[1254.66 → 1255.58] and all the different groups
[1255.58 → 1256.26] that are partnered
[1256.26 → 1257.08] with the Community Kitchen
[1257.08 → 1258.24] and how sometimes
[1258.24 → 1258.84] you can just see
[1258.84 → 1259.66] the difference in churches.
[1259.84 → 1260.38] And this person,
[1260.48 → 1260.62] you know,
[1260.66 → 1261.30] who works with many
[1261.30 → 1261.78] different people
[1261.78 → 1262.24] in the city,
[1262.70 → 1263.10] said, you know,
[1263.16 → 1263.68] there's just nothing
[1263.68 → 1264.24] like churches.
[1264.96 → 1265.52] There's nothing
[1265.52 → 1266.04] like churches.
[1266.16 → 1266.90] They just find a way
[1266.90 → 1268.00] to serve with the gifts.
[1268.08 → 1268.56] They find people
[1268.56 → 1269.00] to get involved.
[1269.08 → 1269.92] They find the money
[1269.92 → 1270.46] when they need it.
[1270.56 → 1271.50] They just pour themselves
[1271.50 → 1271.98] into things.
[1272.04 → 1272.20] He said,
[1272.24 → 1272.68] there's nothing
[1272.68 → 1273.36] like a church
[1273.36 → 1275.24] that's serving selflessly,
[1275.70 → 1276.48] bringing the gifts
[1276.48 → 1277.66] to work interdependently
[1277.66 → 1278.44] to bless.
[1280.60 → 1281.20] And new members
[1281.20 → 1281.68] at this time,
[1281.72 → 1282.58] I just want to say to you
[1282.58 → 1283.32] as you're scattered
[1283.32 → 1284.42] around this sanctuary,
[1284.42 → 1286.04] we talked a lot
[1286.04 → 1286.58] about what it means
[1286.58 → 1287.14] to be a member
[1287.14 → 1288.80] and what brings people
[1288.80 → 1289.24] to churches.
[1289.36 → 1290.02] And I know that
[1290.02 → 1290.96] our church,
[1291.14 → 1291.68] a lot of people
[1291.68 → 1292.58] find our church
[1292.58 → 1293.28] because there's a lot
[1293.28 → 1293.88] of young families
[1293.88 → 1294.42] and want to raise
[1294.42 → 1295.40] their kids with young families
[1295.40 → 1296.54] or we have a great
[1296.54 → 1297.10] youth pastor
[1297.10 → 1297.90] and they want their kids
[1297.90 → 1298.60] to be discipled
[1298.60 → 1299.42] in our youth ministry.
[1299.98 → 1300.76] But I want to reiterate
[1300.76 → 1301.22] what we said
[1301.22 → 1302.04] in the membership classes,
[1302.82 → 1303.52] that you are called
[1303.52 → 1304.20] to serve
[1304.20 → 1306.96] and you come bearing gifts
[1306.96 → 1308.88] that this church needs.
[1309.60 → 1310.78] We need your gifts.
[1311.08 → 1311.88] We don't just want them.
[1311.96 → 1312.76] We need them.
[1313.16 → 1313.88] And I truly believe
[1313.88 → 1314.64] that hope is to be
[1314.64 → 1315.22] a healthy gift.
[1315.34 → 1316.32] It's people discovering
[1316.32 → 1318.94] and deploying those gifts.
[1320.60 → 1321.66] If I could dictate
[1321.66 → 1322.42] your conversation
[1322.42 → 1322.90] in the foyer,
[1323.18 → 1323.88] force you to talk
[1323.88 → 1324.34] about something
[1324.34 → 1325.46] or force you to talk
[1325.46 → 1325.92] about something
[1325.92 → 1327.88] over the dinner table tonight,
[1328.48 → 1329.84] it would be this question.
[1330.54 → 1331.66] How are you called to serve?
[1332.88 → 1333.38] What are the gifts
[1333.38 → 1334.86] God's given you?
[1335.62 → 1336.56] What are the burdens,
[1337.20 → 1338.60] the things that you want to do?
[1338.70 → 1339.08] What are the ways
[1339.08 → 1339.46] that you think,
[1339.58 → 1341.20] okay, I know I'm wired this way.
[1341.34 → 1342.34] This is how I can serve.
[1342.50 → 1343.08] And then say, okay,
[1343.08 → 1344.02] how can I do that
[1344.02 → 1344.56] in this season?
[1345.00 → 1345.70] Especially as the church
[1345.70 → 1346.50] is regathering
[1346.50 → 1346.78] and we're trying
[1346.78 → 1347.88] to find our place again
[1347.88 → 1349.22] in in-person gatherings
[1349.22 → 1349.90] and in the city.
[1350.32 → 1351.36] Where are you called
[1351.36 → 1352.36] to serve?
[1353.60 → 1354.48] And I might add,
[1354.64 → 1355.26] you'll probably need
[1355.26 → 1355.90] to tell the person
[1355.90 → 1356.56] around you
[1356.56 → 1358.14] how they're gifted.
[1358.92 → 1359.94] When I did youth ministry,
[1360.04 → 1360.96] I realized early on
[1360.96 → 1361.46] that a lot of youth
[1361.46 → 1362.16] don't know exactly
[1362.16 → 1362.92] the gifts they have.
[1362.96 → 1363.68] And they need parents,
[1363.88 → 1364.50] uncles, aunts,
[1364.62 → 1365.04] family members,
[1365.14 → 1365.58] youth pastors,
[1365.72 → 1366.50] all the rest to say,
[1366.58 → 1367.50] hey, I'm noticing
[1367.50 → 1368.24] this about you.
[1368.76 → 1370.02] You gravitate towards children.
[1370.54 → 1370.88] Have you thought
[1370.88 → 1371.32] about serving?
[1372.12 → 1372.74] Well, I know you have
[1372.74 → 1373.78] a burden for this ministry
[1373.78 → 1374.24] or that.
[1374.60 → 1375.00] Have you thought
[1375.00 → 1375.72] about getting involved?
[1376.10 → 1376.76] You're not too young.
[1377.58 → 1378.36] We need your gifts.
[1378.94 → 1379.80] You're called to serve.
[1382.76 → 1383.76] Now we get to the list
[1383.76 → 1385.04] that Paul finishes with
[1385.04 → 1386.10] in verse 6.
[1387.38 → 1387.90] He says,
[1387.98 → 1389.18] if your gift is prophesying,
[1389.28 → 1390.02] then prophesy
[1390.02 → 1391.90] according to the faith
[1391.90 → 1393.04] that is given you.
[1393.04 → 1394.96] If it's serving,
[1395.08 → 1395.62] then serve.
[1395.76 → 1396.32] If it's teaching,
[1396.46 → 1396.90] then teach.
[1397.34 → 1398.14] If it's to encourage,
[1398.28 → 1398.94] then give encouragement.
[1399.08 → 1399.62] If it's giving,
[1399.72 → 1400.44] then give generously.
[1400.78 → 1401.40] If it's to lead,
[1401.48 → 1402.12] do it diligently.
[1402.58 → 1403.58] If it is to show mercy,
[1403.76 → 1404.84] do it cheerfully.
[1405.84 → 1407.44] I love that list of gifts.
[1407.70 → 1408.18] And by the way,
[1408.24 → 1408.68] if you're curious,
[1408.78 → 1409.58] this is not Paul's
[1409.58 → 1410.38] exhaustive list.
[1410.68 → 1411.22] He's got a list
[1411.22 → 1412.02] of the fruits of the Spirit
[1412.02 → 1412.42] elsewhere,
[1412.60 → 1413.18] gifts of the Spirit.
[1413.44 → 1414.26] He's got hospitality
[1414.26 → 1414.86] in other places.
[1414.86 → 1416.04] He often just makes
[1416.04 → 1416.68] different lists
[1416.68 → 1417.30] as he writes.
[1418.64 → 1419.96] But I also love the blend.
[1421.18 → 1421.62] You'll see there's
[1421.62 → 1422.66] no division for Paul
[1422.66 → 1423.58] between sort of
[1423.58 → 1424.36] the spiritual gift
[1424.36 → 1424.92] of prophecy,
[1425.06 → 1425.90] if we want to call it that,
[1426.10 → 1427.52] and the ordinary gift
[1427.52 → 1428.06] of serving
[1428.06 → 1429.88] or the ordinary gift,
[1429.96 → 1430.20] you know,
[1430.24 → 1431.50] of hospitality or giving.
[1431.76 → 1432.64] He sees them all
[1432.64 → 1433.16] as what it means
[1433.16 → 1433.84] to be the church.
[1434.42 → 1435.62] If your gift is to prophesy,
[1435.72 → 1436.22] you've got a word
[1436.22 → 1436.68] from the Lord
[1436.68 → 1437.12] for the church,
[1437.26 → 1437.62] speak.
[1438.42 → 1438.78] If you're gifted
[1438.78 → 1439.32] to serve,
[1439.40 → 1440.04] then serve.
[1440.50 → 1440.94] And by the way,
[1440.94 → 1441.28] you should know
[1441.28 → 1442.04] that the word serve there
[1442.04 → 1442.66] is diatonic.
[1442.66 → 1443.42] You know where we get
[1443.42 → 1444.20] the word deacon from?
[1444.84 → 1445.24] That.
[1445.74 → 1446.90] It is to serve.
[1447.52 → 1448.20] If it's to give,
[1448.26 → 1449.20] if God has blessed you,
[1449.26 → 1450.30] then give generously.
[1451.70 → 1452.62] Whatever you have,
[1453.26 → 1453.82] whatever gifts
[1453.82 → 1454.46] you've been given,
[1455.16 → 1455.86] pour them out
[1455.86 → 1456.96] as an act of love
[1456.96 → 1457.60] to your church
[1457.60 → 1458.82] and to your city.
[1462.28 → 1463.20] And this brings me
[1463.20 → 1465.56] to a very important point
[1465.56 → 1466.76] that is easily missed
[1466.76 → 1467.58] when we talk about
[1467.58 → 1467.94] what it means
[1467.94 → 1468.88] to be the body of Christ.
[1469.76 → 1470.70] There are a lot of reasons
[1470.70 → 1471.44] why it matters for Paul.
[1471.52 → 1472.38] Not least the peace
[1472.38 → 1472.84] of the church,
[1472.96 → 1473.74] the health of the church,
[1473.84 → 1474.56] the way they get along
[1474.56 → 1475.06] as family,
[1475.34 → 1476.24] but he's got a wider
[1476.24 → 1477.56] horizon on mind.
[1478.28 → 1478.52] You see,
[1478.64 → 1479.36] Paul goes from city
[1479.36 → 1480.32] to city to plant churches,
[1480.32 → 1481.16] and he knows
[1481.16 → 1482.16] when he visits Galatia,
[1482.52 → 1483.58] the people in Galatia
[1483.58 → 1484.86] are watching the church.
[1485.18 → 1486.02] When he goes to Rome,
[1486.10 → 1486.90] there's people in the city
[1486.90 → 1487.86] who are watching the church.
[1487.96 → 1488.36] They're curious.
[1488.68 → 1489.58] What is different
[1489.58 → 1490.82] about this little community
[1490.82 → 1491.66] that meets in houses
[1491.66 → 1492.48] that is different
[1492.48 → 1493.52] from their social clubs
[1493.52 → 1494.40] or things they could
[1494.40 → 1495.02] be a part of?
[1495.68 → 1497.06] The world is watching.
[1498.06 → 1498.74] And I would add,
[1498.82 → 1500.60] Clayton is curious.
[1501.64 → 1502.32] Why gather?
[1502.84 → 1503.48] Especially now.
[1503.80 → 1504.16] What does it mean
[1504.16 → 1505.12] to be part of this thing
[1505.12 → 1505.72] called the church,
[1505.82 → 1506.32] the ecclesial,
[1506.52 → 1507.42] the called out ones?
[1507.42 → 1508.94] And Paul knows then,
[1509.00 → 1509.98] and we should know now,
[1510.58 → 1511.76] that the world needs to see
[1511.76 → 1512.62] in our mutual,
[1513.44 → 1514.12] selfless,
[1514.62 → 1516.38] interdependent serving.
[1517.40 → 1518.92] They need to see Christ
[1518.92 → 1520.72] working through the body
[1520.72 → 1521.82] to bless.
[1522.96 → 1523.70] They need to see
[1523.70 → 1524.46] through the love
[1524.46 → 1525.36] and the mutual care
[1525.36 → 1525.94] of the church
[1525.94 → 1526.96] that the resurrection
[1526.96 → 1527.52] of Jesus
[1527.52 → 1529.24] has done something new.
[1529.74 → 1530.56] It brings people
[1530.56 → 1531.36] from different backgrounds,
[1531.50 → 1532.48] different stations in life,
[1532.54 → 1533.16] all of that,
[1533.22 → 1534.18] into one family.
[1534.38 → 1535.24] And this family actually
[1535.24 → 1536.84] loves the brothers and sisters,
[1536.84 → 1537.96] and they serve
[1537.96 → 1538.80] as brothers and sisters,
[1539.00 → 1540.16] and it's a whole new community
[1540.16 → 1541.18] made only possible
[1541.18 → 1542.26] by the death
[1542.26 → 1543.16] and resurrection of Jesus.
[1544.64 → 1545.84] And I know for a fact
[1545.84 → 1546.68] there's people in our city
[1546.68 → 1547.68] who left the church
[1547.68 → 1549.18] because of division.
[1550.42 → 1551.46] I know for a fact
[1551.46 → 1552.36] there's people in our city
[1552.36 → 1553.18] who left the church
[1553.18 → 1553.84] because it just felt
[1553.84 → 1554.98] like internal politics
[1554.98 → 1556.46] or just a circle of wagons
[1556.46 → 1557.30] that are only concerned
[1557.30 → 1558.02] about other Christians
[1558.02 → 1558.66] in the building.
[1559.56 → 1561.12] What if they saw a church
[1561.12 → 1563.90] of interdependent service
[1563.90 → 1566.18] where people are creatively
[1566.18 → 1567.16] finding ways to say,
[1567.26 → 1567.94] hey, this is my gift,
[1568.02 → 1568.82] here's how I can serve.
[1569.46 → 1569.94] Where can I meet
[1569.94 → 1570.72] the needs of this city?
[1571.38 → 1571.82] Where can I meet
[1571.82 → 1572.64] the needs of this family?
[1573.58 → 1574.28] Could you imagine
[1574.28 → 1575.10] how that would change
[1575.10 → 1576.24] the way people see the church?
[1577.22 → 1577.88] How it would change
[1577.88 → 1578.68] the way we see
[1578.68 → 1579.76] being part of the church?
[1581.28 → 1582.04] And that brings me
[1582.04 → 1583.28] to my very final point.
[1584.54 → 1586.18] This passage does not start
[1586.18 → 1587.16] with exhortation.
[1587.64 → 1588.72] It does not start
[1588.72 → 1589.62] with Paul saying,
[1589.74 → 1590.56] here is what you are.
[1590.56 → 1592.28] It starts with Paul saying,
[1592.50 → 1594.68] in view of God's mercy.
[1595.60 → 1597.50] In view of God's mercy.
[1597.94 → 1599.10] And we need to recognize
[1599.10 → 1600.00] that starting point
[1600.00 → 1601.38] if we want to even get anywhere
[1601.38 → 1602.82] in this act of serving
[1602.82 → 1603.40] with humility.
[1604.26 → 1605.52] Because it starts with Jesus
[1605.52 → 1607.14] who sees the mess of his world,
[1608.14 → 1609.42] sees the mess of his children,
[1610.18 → 1611.32] and he comes down
[1611.32 → 1612.70] all the way to the cross
[1612.70 → 1614.74] to break the power of sin,
[1615.74 → 1616.56] to set us free.
[1617.32 → 1618.74] He comes all the way
[1618.74 → 1619.92] to forgive us
[1619.92 → 1620.78] of our arrogance
[1620.78 → 1622.02] and self-elevating
[1622.02 → 1623.24] tall poppy syndrome.
[1623.70 → 1624.90] And he comes all the way
[1624.90 → 1626.12] to free us and forgive us
[1626.12 → 1627.18] of self-deprecation
[1627.18 → 1627.88] and self-loathing,
[1627.96 → 1628.70] thinking that we have nothing
[1628.70 → 1629.98] to offer the body.
[1630.48 → 1631.52] And he says to us,
[1631.58 → 1632.30] even this morning,
[1633.10 → 1634.02] I've set you free.
[1635.68 → 1636.72] I've forgiven you.
[1638.06 → 1639.84] You are mine.
[1640.52 → 1641.64] You are my body
[1641.64 → 1642.70] that I've grafted
[1642.70 → 1644.56] into the family I love.
[1644.56 → 1646.16] And now you're sent
[1646.16 → 1647.42] to love,
[1647.92 → 1648.78] to serve,
[1649.08 → 1649.92] to care
[1649.92 → 1651.98] as I fill you with my love,
[1652.22 → 1653.68] as I pour out my spirit
[1653.68 → 1654.48] who will lead you
[1654.48 → 1655.12] into the city
[1655.12 → 1655.76] to bless
[1655.76 → 1657.38] and know that it is
[1657.38 → 1658.28] in my strength
[1658.28 → 1659.84] that I will make myself
[1659.84 → 1660.76] known through you.
[1662.24 → 1663.00] Let's pray.
[1663.00 → 1669.30] Father, we thank you
[1669.30 → 1669.94] for your word.
[1671.36 → 1672.32] And we receive
[1672.32 → 1673.00] the challenge.
[1673.98 → 1674.62] We receive
[1674.62 → 1675.82] the gift of grace.
[1676.40 → 1677.16] And we ask, Lord,
[1677.18 → 1678.38] that you remind us again
[1678.38 → 1680.40] that you and your mercy
[1680.40 → 1681.22] have grafted us
[1681.22 → 1681.92] into your body.
[1683.46 → 1684.04] Lord, I pray
[1684.04 → 1684.80] that you would reveal
[1684.80 → 1685.66] to us the gifts
[1685.66 → 1686.42] you've given us,
[1687.08 → 1688.34] that you would enable us
[1688.34 → 1689.70] to serve in humility,
[1689.92 → 1690.92] not just this body,
[1691.14 → 1692.02] but in our work,
[1692.02 → 1693.42] in our neighbourhoods,
[1693.98 → 1695.14] in the places you call us
[1695.14 → 1696.08] from Monday to Friday.
[1697.02 → 1698.14] But more than anything,
[1698.32 → 1698.92] Lord, we pray
[1698.92 → 1700.70] that people would see
[1700.70 → 1702.14] the death
[1702.14 → 1702.80] and the resurrection
[1702.80 → 1703.36] of Jesus
[1703.36 → 1704.62] has changed something.
[1705.28 → 1706.12] And that this community
[1706.12 → 1706.92] bears witness
[1706.92 → 1707.90] to the good news of Jesus
[1707.90 → 1709.48] in our baby steps
[1709.48 → 1710.52] of selfless service.
[1711.30 → 1712.44] So use us this week
[1712.44 → 1713.10] for your glory
[1713.10 → 1714.28] and for your kingdom.
[1715.04 → 1715.58] Make us
[1715.58 → 1716.96] your humble servants.
[1717.38 → 1718.32] In Christ's name we pray.
[1718.80 → 1719.08] Amen.
[1720.72 → 1721.86] I invite you to stand
[1721.86 → 1722.40] and sing with me
[1722.40 → 1723.32] our song of response.
[1723.32 → 1753.30] Thank you.
