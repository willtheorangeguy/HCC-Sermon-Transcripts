[0.00 --> 29.98]  God bless you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  God bless you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  God bless you.
[90.00 --> 119.98]  God bless you.
[119.98 --> 149.96]  God bless you.
[149.98 --> 179.96]  God bless you.
[179.96 --> 181.96]  God bless you.
[181.96 --> 185.96]  God bless you.
[185.96 --> 187.96]  God bless you.
[187.96 --> 189.96]  God bless you.
[189.96 --> 193.60]  that the tomb is empty and God's new creation has begun.
[194.18 --> 197.08]  As a result, we are a people of hope.
[198.46 --> 200.82]  We're going to look this morning at Luke 24,
[201.08 --> 206.06]  perhaps one of my favorite stories of Jesus revealing himself in his resurrected life.
[206.58 --> 211.48]  And if you have your Bible with me, with you, turn with me to Luke 24, verse 13.
[213.48 --> 217.56]  This is the story of Jesus meeting two travelers on the road to Emmaus.
[220.78 --> 225.78]  Now that same day, two of them were going to a village called Emmaus,
[226.12 --> 228.02]  about seven miles from Jerusalem.
[228.68 --> 231.04]  They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
[231.48 --> 234.08]  And as they talked, they discussed these things with each other.
[234.76 --> 238.10]  Jesus himself came up and walked along with them.
[238.86 --> 240.54]  But they were kept from recognizing him.
[241.50 --> 245.16]  He asked them, what are you discussing together as you walk along?
[246.02 --> 248.94]  They stood still, their faces downcast.
[248.94 --> 251.42]  One of them named Cleopas asked him,
[251.80 --> 257.56]  are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?
[258.58 --> 260.62]  What things? he asked.
[261.24 --> 263.42]  About Jesus of Nazareth, they replied.
[264.10 --> 267.96]  He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.
[268.60 --> 272.18]  The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death,
[272.54 --> 273.64]  and they crucified him.
[273.64 --> 278.02]  But we had hoped that he would be the one who was going to redeem Israel.
[278.54 --> 281.96]  And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.
[283.02 --> 284.84]  In addition, some of our women amazed us.
[284.94 --> 288.22]  They went to the tomb early this morning, but didn't find his body.
[289.06 --> 293.24]  They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.
[293.24 --> 297.50]  Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the woman had said,
[297.98 --> 299.88]  but him they did not see.
[301.40 --> 304.18]  He said to them, how foolish you are,
[304.34 --> 307.56]  and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken.
[308.50 --> 313.68]  Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?
[315.08 --> 317.40]  And beginning with Moses and all the prophets,
[317.40 --> 322.08]  he explained to them what was said in all the scriptures concerning himself.
[322.08 --> 325.70]  As they approached the village to which they were going,
[325.82 --> 328.08]  Jesus continued on as if he were going further.
[328.74 --> 331.94]  But they urged him strongly, stay with us for it is nearly evening,
[332.04 --> 333.44]  for the day is almost over.
[334.14 --> 335.62]  So he went in to stay with them.
[336.80 --> 339.50]  When he was at the table with them, he took bread.
[340.50 --> 344.34]  He gave thanks, broke it, and began to give it to them.
[345.44 --> 349.86]  Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him.
[349.86 --> 352.82]  He disappeared from their sight.
[354.18 --> 357.84]  They asked each other, were our hearts not burning within us
[357.84 --> 362.98]  while he talked with us on the road and opened the scriptures to us?
[366.70 --> 370.56]  They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem.
[371.10 --> 373.90]  There they found the eleven and those with them assembled together
[373.90 --> 376.30]  and said, it is true.
[376.78 --> 379.24]  The Lord has risen and he has appeared to Simon.
[379.82 --> 382.04]  Then they told what had happened on the way
[382.04 --> 385.80]  and how Jesus was recognized them when he broke the bread.
[390.60 --> 394.32]  There is a phrase that I grew up hearing quite often.
[394.84 --> 395.86]  It's a phrase about hope.
[396.20 --> 399.02]  I'm guessing it's a phrase many of us have used in our lives.
[399.02 --> 401.56]  We've heard other people say to us in our lives,
[401.64 --> 405.08]  and it's the simple phrase, don't get your hopes up.
[406.16 --> 406.88]  Have you heard it before?
[408.66 --> 411.76]  I happen to have heard that phrase a lot over the last year.
[412.60 --> 415.24]  One of our leaders said that to me at a meeting in March
[415.24 --> 420.88]  when I said, hopefully, we will definitely be worshiping in person this Easter.
[420.88 --> 427.52]  And I thought that again for Christmas and again for Easter this year.
[428.48 --> 429.82]  Don't get your hopes up.
[431.02 --> 433.48]  Now, people say that because they love people.
[433.88 --> 435.22]  It's often said out of protection.
[436.02 --> 438.40]  They're worried for people who get overly optimistic
[438.40 --> 441.56]  or overly excited about some vision, some idea,
[441.68 --> 443.36]  some thing that they've bought into.
[443.70 --> 445.40]  And those who say it are worried
[445.40 --> 448.72]  that if that vision doesn't come to fruition, what happens?
[449.58 --> 450.60]  They crash.
[450.88 --> 454.56]  In despair, disappointment, and disillusionment.
[455.86 --> 460.54]  The story initially of these two travelers on the road to Emmaus
[460.54 --> 463.02]  is a story of lost hope.
[463.88 --> 468.54]  It's a story of two downcast disciples who have lost hope.
[468.66 --> 469.90]  Their hope has been crucified,
[470.26 --> 474.30]  only to have that hope show up in resurrection life
[474.30 --> 479.82]  and revealed to them that God's great plan laid out in the Scriptures
[479.82 --> 484.30]  has been accomplished through his suffering and his glory.
[484.30 --> 490.66]  Now, we don't know a lot about these two travelers to Emmaus.
[490.76 --> 492.44]  We know that one was called Cleopas.
[492.92 --> 494.24]  The other may have been his wife.
[494.32 --> 496.10]  Some suggest the very woman named Mary
[496.10 --> 498.94]  who is present and documented to be there for the crucifixion.
[499.86 --> 502.76]  What we do know is that they are part of the company of disciples.
[502.92 --> 504.80]  They're apprentices of Jesus.
[504.80 --> 507.38]  They had thrown their lot in with Jesus.
[507.50 --> 509.94]  They were following him, probably patterning their lives after him,
[510.18 --> 513.38]  learning from him, taken by his vision of this kingdom of God.
[514.04 --> 516.76]  But now, they're headed home.
[517.88 --> 519.26]  Their hope had been crucified.
[519.86 --> 522.66]  All that they had wanted to happen through this Jesus figure
[522.66 --> 523.82]  had been fallen away,
[523.82 --> 525.94]  and now it's time to go home.
[527.74 --> 530.04]  Now, Luke tells the story in a masterful way.
[530.14 --> 531.50]  In fact, there are some scholars
[531.50 --> 533.98]  who don't believe that the Scriptures are authoritative
[533.98 --> 535.98]  who say there's no way the story is true.
[536.08 --> 538.20]  It's a too-good-to-be-true kind of story.
[538.94 --> 540.04]  This is a true story.
[540.58 --> 542.28]  And Luke tells it in such a way
[542.28 --> 544.08]  that you are drawn into the narrative.
[544.42 --> 548.22]  You feel what Cleopas and the other traveler felt
[548.22 --> 550.02]  both in their despair
[550.02 --> 554.44]  and in their burning hearts of celebration and joy.
[555.58 --> 556.54]  And Luke, in some sense,
[556.64 --> 558.12]  wants us to see these two travelers
[558.12 --> 561.26]  as the representative of all the disciples then,
[561.70 --> 563.42]  who are dispersed in despair
[563.42 --> 565.80]  and gather in celebration.
[567.34 --> 569.74]  I have in my office this print of art.
[570.32 --> 572.96]  It's called The Road to Emmaus by Daniel Bunnell.
[573.74 --> 575.40]  And I've had it for a number of years now,
[575.48 --> 576.54]  and it's become one of my favorites.
[577.34 --> 578.92]  And you'll notice as you look at that piece,
[578.92 --> 580.46]  it might be small on your screens,
[580.58 --> 583.24]  that there still is that looming shadow of the cross.
[583.32 --> 584.66]  There's darkness at the top,
[584.98 --> 586.34]  and you'll see that there are two,
[586.34 --> 589.50]  those two travelers walking away from it.
[589.96 --> 591.80]  But what they don't yet see
[591.80 --> 594.48]  is that the sun has risen.
[595.52 --> 597.14]  And what they're about to find out,
[597.24 --> 599.00]  as this piece of art beautifully demonstrates,
[599.36 --> 602.34]  is the risen Savior is going to reveal to them
[602.34 --> 604.98]  that their hope was not in vain.
[606.48 --> 608.52]  What we love about this story, I think,
[608.52 --> 609.86]  or at least what I love about it,
[609.88 --> 611.90]  is that we know what these two travelers don't.
[612.38 --> 615.16]  We know who that third person on the road is.
[615.20 --> 616.92]  And one of the striking features of this story
[616.92 --> 620.10]  is that Jesus does not just reveal himself right away
[620.10 --> 621.10]  to these two travelers.
[621.22 --> 622.84]  They're kept from seeing who he is
[622.84 --> 624.34]  until they break bread with him.
[624.88 --> 626.68]  And it's almost cruel, it seems to me,
[626.84 --> 628.56]  that as their faces are downcast,
[628.62 --> 630.38]  they're struggling to make sense of what goes on,
[630.66 --> 632.06]  Jesus shows up, and he doesn't say,
[632.18 --> 632.74]  it's me.
[632.74 --> 636.60]  He says, hey, what are you talking about?
[637.50 --> 639.20]  Which is the equivalent today, I think,
[639.24 --> 640.24]  of us walking around saying,
[640.34 --> 641.88]  hey, what's with the masks?
[643.08 --> 644.14]  And they say to Jesus,
[644.48 --> 646.74]  are you not the only person in Jerusalem
[646.74 --> 648.42]  who doesn't know what's happened here?
[648.76 --> 650.54]  Are you like living under a rock?
[651.24 --> 653.86]  And they proceed to tell Jesus about Jesus.
[654.92 --> 655.80]  Imagine this scene.
[655.86 --> 658.10]  They tell Jesus their take on Jesus.
[658.22 --> 659.56]  And I want to read for you what they say.
[659.64 --> 661.00]  This passage has a lot in it.
[661.32 --> 662.04]  They say to him,
[662.92 --> 664.18]  he was a powerful prophet,
[665.14 --> 667.20]  powerful in word and deed before God
[667.20 --> 668.02]  and all the people.
[668.76 --> 670.32]  The chief priests and the rulers,
[670.60 --> 672.58]  they handed him over to be sentenced to death,
[672.60 --> 673.70]  and they crucified him.
[674.22 --> 676.30]  But we had hoped that he would be the one
[676.30 --> 677.90]  who's going to redeem Israel.
[679.08 --> 680.64]  And what is more, on the third day,
[680.74 --> 681.96]  since all that took place,
[682.78 --> 683.56]  in addition to this,
[683.60 --> 684.76]  some of our women went to the tomb.
[684.76 --> 685.90]  They didn't find his body.
[686.20 --> 687.72]  Our companions went to the tomb too,
[687.72 --> 689.88]  but they did not see his body.
[691.22 --> 692.52]  There's a number of interesting things
[692.52 --> 694.60]  about this account they give to Jesus about him.
[695.22 --> 697.62]  You can see a genuine mix, I think,
[697.66 --> 700.08]  of despair and confusion.
[701.04 --> 702.88]  I mean, these are not dumb disciples.
[703.68 --> 705.42]  They know what crucifixion means.
[705.62 --> 706.62]  They don't need to be told that
[706.62 --> 707.36]  when you're crucified,
[707.54 --> 708.58]  that's the end of the story.
[708.82 --> 710.52]  They've probably seen other crucifixions
[710.52 --> 711.86]  or at least heard of them,
[712.18 --> 714.14]  and they know that that's the end of it.
[714.70 --> 716.54]  Their hope felt in vain.
[716.54 --> 719.28]  But the story kind of moves forward,
[719.38 --> 721.14]  and as they share with him
[721.14 --> 722.76]  that they are in despair,
[722.88 --> 723.48]  they also say,
[723.62 --> 724.84]  look, some women went to the tomb.
[724.98 --> 726.88]  They heard a story of this angel
[726.88 --> 727.90]  who said he was alive.
[728.18 --> 729.34]  They couldn't find the body,
[729.64 --> 730.54]  and there's that sense of like
[730.54 --> 732.04]  almost a glimmer of hope.
[732.78 --> 735.10]  But remember, they're walking home.
[736.10 --> 737.50]  They're not sticking around Jerusalem
[737.50 --> 738.40]  to see what's happened,
[738.50 --> 739.64]  and there's a sense in which,
[739.74 --> 741.28]  and this is true of many of the disciples,
[741.74 --> 742.86]  especially Thomas,
[742.86 --> 744.90]  who want to believe.
[745.82 --> 746.58]  They know,
[746.70 --> 747.96]  and they remember Jesus saying
[747.96 --> 749.52]  over and over again in many places,
[749.52 --> 750.52]  on the third day,
[750.60 --> 751.78]  I'll rise again from the dead,
[751.90 --> 754.70]  but this is hard to believe, right?
[755.72 --> 757.28]  Thomas and many of the disciples,
[757.50 --> 759.26]  they needed to see it,
[759.50 --> 760.32]  and until then,
[760.62 --> 761.40]  these two travelers
[761.40 --> 763.28]  are walking back home.
[763.28 --> 766.94]  I think the part of this passage
[766.94 --> 768.26]  that stands out most to me
[768.26 --> 769.64]  is that phrase,
[769.74 --> 771.22]  a confession of faith, really,
[771.30 --> 771.92]  where they say,
[772.22 --> 773.40]  but we had hoped
[773.40 --> 775.68]  that he was going to be the one
[775.68 --> 778.12]  who redeemed Israel.
[779.48 --> 780.16]  And no doubt,
[780.46 --> 781.48]  as many writers say,
[781.52 --> 782.92]  it's probably a narrow vision
[782.92 --> 783.72]  they had of Jesus.
[784.54 --> 785.42]  They may have thought
[785.42 --> 787.42]  Jesus was just going to restore Israel,
[787.62 --> 788.70]  defeat all the enemies,
[788.92 --> 790.38]  and they had sort of a narrow vision
[790.38 --> 792.18]  of just one people being restored
[792.18 --> 793.82]  and renewed by him,
[794.74 --> 795.96]  but they caught a glimpse.
[796.98 --> 798.70]  They caught a glimpse in Jesus
[798.70 --> 800.20]  of power and authority.
[800.36 --> 802.18]  They probably saw him feed the 5,000,
[802.30 --> 802.82]  and they knew
[802.82 --> 804.18]  that something new
[804.18 --> 805.34]  was breaking in with him.
[805.86 --> 807.18]  The kingdom of God was present
[807.74 --> 808.84]  in his teaching,
[809.00 --> 809.64]  his healing,
[809.90 --> 810.68]  his authority,
[810.96 --> 811.94]  his breaking bread
[811.94 --> 813.14]  with all the wrong people,
[813.22 --> 814.54]  his words of grace.
[814.98 --> 818.08]  There was a glimpse of life with him,
[818.78 --> 821.70]  and that captured their hope.
[822.18 --> 824.90]  Such that they left Emmaus,
[825.14 --> 827.38]  and they were following Jesus.
[828.44 --> 830.12]  They had hope in him.
[830.56 --> 831.90]  They caught a glimmer of life
[831.90 --> 832.90]  with the resurrection.
[833.14 --> 833.92]  And Tim Keller says,
[834.18 --> 835.60]  what we're seeing in their despair
[835.60 --> 836.74]  and their downcast faces
[836.74 --> 838.34]  is disciples who are now
[838.34 --> 839.72]  reimagining the world
[839.72 --> 840.92]  without that hope.
[841.70 --> 843.00]  They're now trying to recalibrate
[843.00 --> 843.74]  the hope they had
[843.74 --> 844.82]  and what it means now
[844.82 --> 846.66]  that Jesus didn't rise from the dead.
[847.06 --> 847.78]  And they're back
[847.78 --> 849.70]  to the grinding pain of life
[849.70 --> 851.64]  without resurrection.
[853.54 --> 854.88]  There's a book by a man
[854.88 --> 855.98]  named Rollo May.
[856.80 --> 858.26]  He's an American psychiatrist,
[858.62 --> 859.70]  lived a number of years ago.
[860.10 --> 861.02]  And the book is called
[861.02 --> 862.12]  My Quest for Beauty.
[863.38 --> 864.66]  And he's not a particularly
[864.66 --> 866.48]  religious person whatsoever,
[866.62 --> 867.64]  quite critical in fact.
[868.00 --> 869.00]  And he tells the story
[869.00 --> 870.28]  where he was on vacation,
[870.56 --> 871.50]  traveling in Greece
[871.50 --> 873.46]  to the place called Mount Athos.
[874.38 --> 875.52]  And as he's walking one night,
[875.58 --> 876.36]  he actually walked by
[876.36 --> 877.60]  an all-night Easter vigil
[877.60 --> 878.84]  that the church was hosting.
[879.56 --> 880.44]  And he walked by
[880.44 --> 881.46]  and out of intrigue,
[881.52 --> 882.50]  he stopped and he looked
[882.50 --> 883.52]  at this church and he thought,
[883.58 --> 883.98]  you know what?
[884.72 --> 885.80]  I'm just going to walk in.
[886.52 --> 887.22]  I want to see what
[887.22 --> 888.52]  these religious people do
[888.52 --> 889.66]  in this religious thing
[889.66 --> 890.88]  of an all-night Easter vigil.
[890.94 --> 891.72]  And he placed himself
[891.72 --> 893.60]  at the very back of the church.
[894.22 --> 895.44]  And the ceremony went on,
[895.52 --> 896.48]  this service went on.
[896.52 --> 897.60]  At the end of the service,
[898.06 --> 899.22]  a priest stood up
[899.22 --> 900.64]  and he said to the congregation
[900.64 --> 901.34]  as they stood,
[901.34 --> 904.28]  he said, Christ is risen.
[905.00 --> 906.26]  And everybody said
[906.26 --> 907.14]  in a loud voice
[907.14 --> 908.14]  just like we did this morning,
[908.24 --> 909.72]  he's risen indeed.
[910.50 --> 911.20]  Then he repeated,
[911.40 --> 912.84]  Christ is risen.
[913.04 --> 913.66]  And they repeated,
[913.96 --> 915.44]  he's risen indeed.
[915.94 --> 917.34]  This happened a third time
[917.34 --> 919.18]  and he found himself
[919.18 --> 920.24]  by that third time
[920.24 --> 922.02]  actually speaking these words
[922.02 --> 923.70]  with the congregation.
[924.36 --> 925.34]  And as he uttered them,
[925.40 --> 926.48]  as they sort of came out
[926.48 --> 927.10]  of his mouth
[927.10 --> 928.16]  by his own surprise,
[928.54 --> 929.82]  he felt something deep
[929.82 --> 930.94]  resonate within him.
[931.34 --> 931.94]  I want to read
[931.94 --> 932.48]  what he wrote.
[933.78 --> 934.30]  He said,
[934.42 --> 936.20]  suddenly I was seized
[936.20 --> 936.96]  by a moment
[936.96 --> 938.44]  of spiritual reality.
[939.36 --> 940.28]  I thought,
[940.52 --> 942.36]  what would it mean
[942.36 --> 943.48]  if indeed
[943.48 --> 945.16]  he was risen?
[946.32 --> 948.34]  What if death
[948.34 --> 950.22]  wasn't the end?
[951.28 --> 952.28]  In that moment,
[952.36 --> 952.70]  you know what
[952.70 --> 953.70]  Rolo May was doing?
[954.50 --> 956.36]  He was trying on
[956.36 --> 957.10]  Christian hope.
[958.12 --> 958.86]  This man who had
[958.86 --> 959.90]  no real respect
[959.90 --> 960.80]  for the Christian faith
[960.80 --> 961.68]  was sitting there
[961.68 --> 962.48]  at the back
[962.48 --> 963.34]  of this Easter vigil
[963.34 --> 964.38]  and he was just
[964.38 --> 966.10]  placing himself briefly
[966.10 --> 967.72]  in that place
[967.72 --> 968.16]  where he said,
[968.32 --> 969.56]  what if it's true?
[970.92 --> 972.46]  What if this man
[972.46 --> 973.66]  rose from the dead?
[973.90 --> 975.14]  What if there is hope
[975.14 --> 975.92]  for this world
[975.92 --> 977.12]  lost in despair?
[977.52 --> 978.40]  What if the grave
[978.40 --> 979.54]  wasn't the final statement
[979.54 --> 980.18]  over human life?
[980.44 --> 981.42]  What if it's true?
[982.14 --> 982.82]  What if he rose
[982.82 --> 983.48]  from the dead?
[983.68 --> 984.84]  What would that mean
[984.84 --> 985.54]  for us?
[986.02 --> 986.72]  And he was taken
[986.72 --> 987.58]  by its beauty.
[988.76 --> 989.46]  I'm guessing
[989.46 --> 990.28]  even this morning
[990.28 --> 990.88]  that some of us
[990.88 --> 992.28]  tuned into this live stream
[992.28 --> 992.98]  struggling through
[992.98 --> 993.86]  questions of faith
[993.86 --> 995.46]  and I hope
[995.46 --> 996.22]  this morning
[996.22 --> 997.06]  you try on
[997.06 --> 997.72]  that question.
[998.68 --> 999.56]  What if it's true?
[1000.94 --> 1002.28]  What if his kingdom
[1002.28 --> 1002.82]  came?
[1003.62 --> 1004.54]  What if everything
[1004.54 --> 1005.76]  Jesus promised
[1005.76 --> 1007.24]  to do in his ministry
[1007.24 --> 1008.70]  he accomplished
[1008.70 --> 1009.66]  through his death
[1009.66 --> 1010.46]  and his resurrection?
[1011.26 --> 1012.86]  What might that mean?
[1012.86 --> 1015.94]  The travelers
[1015.94 --> 1016.80]  you should know
[1016.80 --> 1018.14]  have their faces
[1018.14 --> 1018.88]  downcast
[1018.88 --> 1019.84]  and they're experiencing
[1019.84 --> 1021.10]  pain and despair
[1021.10 --> 1022.72]  because that hope
[1022.72 --> 1023.44]  that they had
[1023.44 --> 1024.72]  in some glimmer
[1024.72 --> 1026.78]  has now left them
[1026.78 --> 1027.96]  as they return
[1027.96 --> 1028.78]  back to their home.
[1029.06 --> 1029.90]  And here's the center
[1029.90 --> 1030.40]  of the struggle.
[1030.52 --> 1031.50]  I want us to understand
[1031.50 --> 1032.56]  what they struggled
[1032.56 --> 1033.84]  so deeply with
[1033.84 --> 1034.56]  and Pastor Sid
[1034.56 --> 1035.14]  touched on this
[1035.14 --> 1035.62]  in his sermon
[1035.62 --> 1036.28]  on Good Friday
[1036.28 --> 1037.94]  is that they could not
[1037.94 --> 1038.76]  for a moment
[1038.76 --> 1039.96]  comprehend
[1039.96 --> 1041.22]  a Messiah
[1041.22 --> 1042.52]  who would suffer.
[1043.52 --> 1045.32]  They so clearly saw
[1045.32 --> 1045.96]  that the Messiah
[1045.96 --> 1046.76]  needed to be
[1046.76 --> 1047.72]  a military victor.
[1048.14 --> 1048.88]  He needed to be able
[1048.88 --> 1049.80]  to fight Rome.
[1049.88 --> 1050.46]  He needed to be able
[1050.46 --> 1051.58]  to defeat an enemy
[1051.58 --> 1052.56]  with physical battle.
[1052.86 --> 1053.32]  They could not
[1053.32 --> 1054.22]  for a moment
[1054.22 --> 1054.94]  comprehend
[1054.94 --> 1056.74]  that the Messiah
[1056.74 --> 1057.62]  of the world
[1057.62 --> 1059.14]  would be betrayed,
[1060.06 --> 1060.84]  he'd be arrested,
[1061.40 --> 1062.44]  he'd be mocked,
[1062.74 --> 1064.24]  beaten, spit on
[1064.24 --> 1065.98]  and nailed
[1065.98 --> 1067.18]  to Roman planks
[1067.18 --> 1067.72]  of death.
[1068.60 --> 1069.74]  That was so far
[1069.74 --> 1070.74]  beyond their comprehension
[1070.74 --> 1071.84]  much less
[1071.84 --> 1073.38]  that after all that
[1073.38 --> 1074.02]  the Messiah
[1074.02 --> 1075.14]  would by the power
[1075.14 --> 1075.68]  of God
[1075.68 --> 1077.12]  raise back to life.
[1077.18 --> 1078.98]  This was incomprehensible.
[1081.70 --> 1083.42]  Now Jesus finally speaks
[1083.42 --> 1085.58]  and he doesn't yet
[1085.58 --> 1086.96]  say who he is.
[1087.64 --> 1088.14]  He says,
[1088.50 --> 1088.86]  rebuke,
[1089.08 --> 1090.30]  how foolish you are
[1090.30 --> 1091.26]  and how slow to believe
[1091.26 --> 1091.54]  what?
[1091.84 --> 1093.22]  All that the prophets
[1093.22 --> 1094.62]  and the law
[1094.62 --> 1095.72]  have spoken.
[1096.42 --> 1097.46]  Just when you thought
[1097.46 --> 1098.34]  Jesus was gentle,
[1098.50 --> 1099.28]  words of rebuke.
[1099.76 --> 1100.34]  And then he goes on
[1100.34 --> 1100.54]  to say,
[1100.62 --> 1101.60]  did not the Messiah
[1101.60 --> 1102.68]  have to suffer
[1102.68 --> 1103.40]  these things
[1103.40 --> 1105.16]  and then enter
[1105.16 --> 1106.16]  his glory?
[1108.24 --> 1109.14]  Again and again,
[1109.56 --> 1110.16]  the Old Testament
[1110.16 --> 1111.88]  shows this suffering
[1111.88 --> 1113.12]  motif for Jesus.
[1113.56 --> 1114.58]  But Jesus gives them,
[1114.76 --> 1115.48]  in my opinion,
[1115.88 --> 1117.00]  one of the best gifts
[1117.00 --> 1118.60]  anyone can receive.
[1118.72 --> 1119.32]  You know what that is?
[1120.68 --> 1121.52]  He tells them
[1121.52 --> 1122.40]  the story of the Bible.
[1123.72 --> 1124.38]  Imagine that.
[1125.08 --> 1126.46]  Imagine these two disciples
[1126.46 --> 1127.84]  struggling to believe
[1127.84 --> 1128.70]  all that had happened,
[1128.84 --> 1129.60]  feeling despair
[1129.60 --> 1130.68]  of Jesus' crucifixion.
[1130.98 --> 1131.64]  Jesus shows up.
[1131.68 --> 1132.34]  They don't know it yet.
[1132.60 --> 1133.36]  And what he does
[1133.36 --> 1133.82]  is say,
[1134.36 --> 1137.60]  this is how the whole story
[1137.60 --> 1139.12]  is about me.
[1140.10 --> 1140.58]  And we read,
[1140.68 --> 1141.64]  beginning with Moses
[1141.64 --> 1142.52]  and all the prophets,
[1142.66 --> 1143.42]  he explained to them
[1143.42 --> 1143.96]  what was said
[1143.96 --> 1144.96]  in all the scriptures.
[1145.18 --> 1146.00]  All the scriptures
[1146.00 --> 1147.42]  concerning himself.
[1147.60 --> 1148.10]  And when Jesus
[1148.10 --> 1148.62]  says scriptures,
[1148.72 --> 1149.12]  just so you know,
[1149.30 --> 1150.16]  that isn't the New Testament.
[1150.28 --> 1151.02]  It hasn't been written yet.
[1151.18 --> 1151.82]  He's talking about
[1151.82 --> 1153.16]  the Old Testament story.
[1153.70 --> 1154.76]  All of it coming
[1154.76 --> 1155.76]  to its climax,
[1155.94 --> 1156.52]  its fulfillment
[1156.52 --> 1158.34]  in the work of Jesus Christ.
[1158.66 --> 1159.80]  Oh, to be able
[1159.80 --> 1160.56]  to listen in
[1160.56 --> 1161.62]  and sort of walk
[1161.62 --> 1162.52]  alongside them
[1162.52 --> 1163.78]  as Jesus tells them,
[1163.98 --> 1164.98]  this is what the story
[1164.98 --> 1165.44]  of the Bible
[1165.44 --> 1166.48]  is all about.
[1169.06 --> 1169.74]  Now, we,
[1169.88 --> 1170.38]  on this side
[1170.38 --> 1170.96]  of the resurrection,
[1171.20 --> 1172.02]  we have gone back
[1172.02 --> 1172.70]  to the Old Testament.
[1172.86 --> 1173.52]  We've mined it
[1173.52 --> 1174.06]  and looked at it
[1174.06 --> 1174.68]  through the lens
[1174.68 --> 1175.26]  of the resurrection
[1175.26 --> 1176.10]  and we see
[1176.10 --> 1177.58]  all over the scriptures
[1177.58 --> 1179.82]  that Jesus is
[1179.82 --> 1180.70]  the suffering servant,
[1181.14 --> 1181.62]  that he's the one
[1181.62 --> 1182.76]  who dies and rises again.
[1182.82 --> 1183.34]  We already see it
[1183.34 --> 1184.44]  in Genesis 3.15
[1184.44 --> 1185.14]  where the Satan,
[1185.44 --> 1185.84]  the serpent,
[1185.84 --> 1186.68]  will strike his heel.
[1186.72 --> 1187.34]  What will he do?
[1187.74 --> 1189.06]  He'll crush the head
[1189.06 --> 1189.70]  of the serpent.
[1190.26 --> 1191.66]  We see it in Psalm 16
[1191.66 --> 1192.24]  where it says
[1192.24 --> 1193.20]  that God will not
[1193.20 --> 1194.36]  let his righteous one
[1194.36 --> 1195.22]  see decay.
[1195.62 --> 1196.36]  And perhaps more
[1196.36 --> 1197.08]  than anywhere else,
[1197.14 --> 1198.34]  we see it in Isaiah 53
[1198.34 --> 1199.80]  where there's this
[1199.80 --> 1200.58]  suffering servant
[1200.58 --> 1202.34]  who comes from God's people,
[1202.50 --> 1203.76]  who takes on the sin,
[1204.08 --> 1205.24]  who takes on the iniquity,
[1205.32 --> 1206.32]  he takes on death
[1206.32 --> 1207.94]  and he goes to death.
[1208.06 --> 1208.36]  Why?
[1208.86 --> 1209.82]  To bring healing
[1209.82 --> 1211.16]  and restoration.
[1211.16 --> 1211.36]  restoration.
[1213.26 --> 1214.44]  But there's more,
[1214.82 --> 1215.52]  I think,
[1216.00 --> 1217.38]  to what Jesus is saying
[1217.38 --> 1218.92]  than just saying
[1218.92 --> 1219.86]  when you go back
[1219.86 --> 1220.36]  to the scriptures
[1220.36 --> 1221.36]  you'll see predictions
[1221.36 --> 1223.24]  of what I'm about to do.
[1223.38 --> 1224.16]  This is not
[1224.16 --> 1225.58]  just a story
[1225.58 --> 1226.36]  about a body
[1226.36 --> 1227.64]  coming back to life.
[1228.66 --> 1230.12]  This is Jesus saying
[1230.12 --> 1232.44]  everything that God
[1232.44 --> 1233.84]  set out to do
[1233.84 --> 1234.68]  in the scriptures,
[1235.18 --> 1236.76]  every promise he made
[1236.76 --> 1237.46]  to his people
[1237.46 --> 1238.36]  and to his world,
[1238.36 --> 1240.42]  I have fulfilled
[1240.42 --> 1242.14]  through the cross
[1242.14 --> 1243.56]  and in my resurrection.
[1245.04 --> 1245.86]  If you've been a hope
[1245.86 --> 1247.08]  for long enough,
[1247.14 --> 1247.88]  you'll know that we talk
[1247.88 --> 1249.16]  about the true story
[1249.16 --> 1249.80]  of the whole world,
[1249.88 --> 1251.06]  the story of the Bible.
[1251.30 --> 1252.66]  We believe it is coherent
[1252.66 --> 1253.48]  and unfolding,
[1253.62 --> 1255.40]  that it starts with creation
[1255.40 --> 1257.86]  and it ends with recreation.
[1258.50 --> 1259.20]  And in the middle
[1259.20 --> 1260.60]  is the work of Jesus Christ
[1260.60 --> 1262.10]  that makes sense of it all.
[1262.18 --> 1263.34]  It's the hinge of history,
[1263.46 --> 1264.50]  the clue that gives us
[1264.50 --> 1266.16]  understanding to every single
[1266.16 --> 1267.02]  page of the Bible.
[1267.02 --> 1268.70]  But when Jesus
[1268.70 --> 1270.12]  is telling them the story,
[1270.84 --> 1272.14]  he wants every reader
[1272.14 --> 1272.74]  to know
[1272.74 --> 1275.22]  that the kingdom of God
[1275.22 --> 1277.10]  is creation.
[1278.24 --> 1279.00]  When we look back
[1279.00 --> 1279.56]  to the beginning
[1279.56 --> 1280.18]  and God creates
[1280.18 --> 1280.74]  this beautiful,
[1281.00 --> 1281.30]  stunning,
[1281.54 --> 1282.16]  glorious world
[1282.16 --> 1284.04]  to be inhabited by us,
[1284.94 --> 1285.90]  Jesus comes
[1285.90 --> 1288.00]  to heal the whole of it.
[1289.14 --> 1289.58]  In fact,
[1289.66 --> 1290.20]  right at the beginning
[1290.20 --> 1290.76]  of the scriptures,
[1290.90 --> 1291.78]  we see in Genesis 3
[1291.78 --> 1292.70]  this virus
[1292.70 --> 1294.64]  coming into God's good world.
[1295.54 --> 1295.84]  And no,
[1295.84 --> 1296.94]  it is not COVID-19.
[1297.76 --> 1299.28]  It's the virus of sin.
[1300.10 --> 1301.18]  And that virus spreads
[1301.18 --> 1302.36]  not just through one couple
[1302.36 --> 1303.16]  in the rebellion,
[1303.50 --> 1304.72]  it spreads to their children
[1304.72 --> 1305.90]  and not just to one nation,
[1305.98 --> 1306.72]  but all the nations,
[1306.90 --> 1308.18]  including Israel.
[1309.06 --> 1310.04]  And out of that,
[1310.12 --> 1310.74]  people of Israel,
[1310.92 --> 1312.14]  comes Jesus in the story
[1312.14 --> 1313.06]  and he is the one
[1313.06 --> 1314.14]  faithful Israelite
[1314.14 --> 1315.10]  who will do
[1315.10 --> 1316.26]  what no Israelite
[1316.26 --> 1316.94]  could do before,
[1317.50 --> 1318.48]  and that is defeat
[1318.48 --> 1319.72]  the power
[1319.72 --> 1321.04]  of that virus.
[1322.64 --> 1322.84]  You know,
[1322.88 --> 1323.64]  this very morning
[1323.64 --> 1324.10]  I was up
[1324.10 --> 1325.30]  and taking a break
[1325.30 --> 1326.16]  from my sermon prep,
[1326.24 --> 1327.02]  I read the news.
[1327.98 --> 1328.90]  And there's an article
[1328.90 --> 1330.32]  on Easter and hope
[1330.32 --> 1331.08]  and I was just struck
[1331.08 --> 1332.28]  by how one writer
[1332.28 --> 1333.36]  said these words.
[1333.48 --> 1333.94]  He writes,
[1334.06 --> 1334.64]  at Easter,
[1335.42 --> 1336.40]  Christians celebrate
[1336.40 --> 1337.92]  salvation from something
[1337.92 --> 1340.18]  far more deadly
[1340.18 --> 1341.58]  than a global pandemic
[1341.58 --> 1342.90]  or perhaps
[1342.90 --> 1344.08]  the original
[1344.08 --> 1345.58]  pandemic,
[1346.04 --> 1347.54]  the enduring pandemic,
[1347.70 --> 1349.26]  that is sin,
[1349.86 --> 1350.98]  which has escaped
[1350.98 --> 1351.60]  from Eden
[1351.60 --> 1352.52]  and haunted
[1352.52 --> 1353.62]  the world
[1353.62 --> 1354.94]  ever since.
[1356.14 --> 1356.90]  And when Jesus
[1356.90 --> 1358.12]  comes onto the scene,
[1358.52 --> 1359.02]  he has come
[1359.02 --> 1359.78]  to deal with that.
[1359.86 --> 1360.16]  In fact,
[1360.44 --> 1361.04]  when the time
[1361.04 --> 1361.88]  had reached its fullness,
[1362.02 --> 1362.84]  say the gospel writers,
[1362.96 --> 1364.36]  God sent Jesus
[1364.36 --> 1365.44]  for that purpose.
[1365.90 --> 1366.66]  He sent Jesus
[1366.66 --> 1367.68]  to do what no one else
[1367.68 --> 1368.10]  could do,
[1368.30 --> 1369.28]  what no people could do,
[1369.32 --> 1370.00]  and that is defeat
[1370.00 --> 1370.46]  its power,
[1370.76 --> 1371.76]  exhaust Satan's power,
[1372.04 --> 1372.92]  bring it to the grave,
[1373.02 --> 1374.04]  and rise victorious
[1374.04 --> 1374.70]  to new life.
[1375.50 --> 1376.14]  And this morning,
[1376.22 --> 1377.54]  we're not just celebrating
[1377.54 --> 1378.34]  the forgiveness
[1378.34 --> 1379.06]  of our sin,
[1379.10 --> 1379.56]  which happened
[1379.56 --> 1380.16]  on Good Friday.
[1380.16 --> 1380.90]  Jesus defeated
[1380.90 --> 1381.60]  the power of sin.
[1381.90 --> 1382.88]  We're not just celebrating
[1382.88 --> 1384.08]  the rising of a body.
[1384.20 --> 1384.62]  Hear this.
[1384.92 --> 1385.66]  We're celebrating
[1385.66 --> 1386.72]  Jesus and his death
[1386.72 --> 1387.28]  and resurrection,
[1387.68 --> 1388.66]  bringing new life
[1388.66 --> 1390.50]  to his whole creation
[1390.50 --> 1392.34]  through all that
[1392.34 --> 1392.98]  he has accomplished.
[1393.80 --> 1394.16]  This,
[1394.36 --> 1395.14]  as one of my favorite
[1395.14 --> 1396.10]  writers has put it,
[1396.34 --> 1398.00]  is the first day
[1398.00 --> 1399.64]  of the new creation.
[1400.70 --> 1401.70]  Hope is restored
[1401.70 --> 1403.16]  through the resurrection.
[1404.54 --> 1405.20]  And if we're all
[1405.20 --> 1406.22]  gathered in person,
[1407.04 --> 1408.12]  at least a few of you,
[1408.24 --> 1408.40]  you know,
[1408.48 --> 1409.58]  Nana and Joe
[1409.58 --> 1410.88]  and Char would say,
[1411.58 --> 1411.88]  Amen.
[1414.18 --> 1415.08]  Okay, now I'm preaching,
[1415.16 --> 1416.04]  I lost my spot.
[1420.00 --> 1420.90]  At this moment
[1420.90 --> 1421.50]  in the story,
[1421.62 --> 1422.56]  Cleopas and the fellow
[1422.56 --> 1424.26]  traveler still do not know
[1424.26 --> 1425.50]  who Jesus is.
[1425.56 --> 1426.74]  He is still undercover,
[1426.94 --> 1427.64]  you might say.
[1428.26 --> 1429.34]  And as they talk
[1429.34 --> 1429.76]  and they walk,
[1429.84 --> 1430.84]  they finally get to Emmaus,
[1430.94 --> 1431.92]  Jesus looks like
[1431.92 --> 1432.76]  he's going on,
[1432.78 --> 1433.14]  and they say,
[1433.20 --> 1433.86]  come inside,
[1433.92 --> 1434.68]  it's getting late,
[1435.04 --> 1435.84]  stay with us.
[1435.92 --> 1436.30]  And Jesus,
[1436.54 --> 1437.06]  which I love,
[1437.06 --> 1437.54]  by the way,
[1437.90 --> 1439.06]  in his resurrected life
[1439.06 --> 1439.94]  and all that he could do,
[1439.98 --> 1440.24]  he's like,
[1440.42 --> 1440.60]  yeah,
[1441.18 --> 1441.92]  we're going to break bread
[1441.92 --> 1442.22]  together,
[1442.30 --> 1443.04]  I've got time.
[1443.70 --> 1445.06]  And it's over that meal
[1445.06 --> 1445.66]  and I just,
[1445.74 --> 1446.76]  just imagine this scene.
[1447.72 --> 1448.66]  They're sitting with Jesus,
[1448.86 --> 1449.86]  he takes the bread,
[1450.64 --> 1451.96]  he gives thanks for it,
[1452.16 --> 1453.10]  he breaks it,
[1453.36 --> 1454.82]  and he gives the bread
[1454.82 --> 1455.32]  to them.
[1456.10 --> 1457.18]  And at that moment,
[1457.68 --> 1458.82]  the scales fall
[1458.82 --> 1459.74]  from their eyes
[1459.74 --> 1461.16]  and they see
[1461.16 --> 1462.94]  their resurrection hope.
[1462.94 --> 1465.00]  They see
[1465.00 --> 1466.24]  the risen
[1466.24 --> 1467.14]  Savior.
[1468.10 --> 1468.74]  And the faces
[1468.74 --> 1469.86]  that were downcast
[1469.86 --> 1471.22]  are now illumined
[1471.22 --> 1472.08]  with revelation.
[1472.88 --> 1475.38]  All that we had hoped for
[1475.38 --> 1477.34]  is true.
[1478.42 --> 1479.90]  It wasn't in vain,
[1480.14 --> 1480.80]  Cleopas.
[1481.00 --> 1482.56]  It wasn't in vain.
[1483.20 --> 1484.30]  All the apprentices
[1484.30 --> 1485.52]  who had thrown
[1485.52 --> 1486.22]  their lot in
[1486.22 --> 1486.80]  with this Jesus,
[1486.88 --> 1487.70]  who caught a glimpse
[1487.70 --> 1488.20]  of the kingdom,
[1488.44 --> 1489.16]  it came.
[1489.96 --> 1491.10]  And they beheld him
[1491.10 --> 1492.24]  with their very eyes
[1492.24 --> 1493.24]  and joined the witnesses
[1493.24 --> 1494.12]  of the early church
[1494.12 --> 1496.00]  in seeing the resurrected Jesus.
[1497.32 --> 1498.40]  But just as soon
[1498.40 --> 1499.22]  as they saw him,
[1499.30 --> 1500.00]  he moved on
[1500.00 --> 1501.42]  and he left.
[1501.84 --> 1502.78]  And they say to each other
[1502.78 --> 1503.24]  these words,
[1503.28 --> 1504.02]  I've been thinking a lot
[1504.02 --> 1504.74]  about these words
[1504.74 --> 1505.62]  this week.
[1506.06 --> 1506.50]  They say,
[1507.00 --> 1507.98]  were our hearts
[1507.98 --> 1510.10]  not burning within us
[1510.10 --> 1512.32]  while he traveled with us
[1512.32 --> 1513.20]  and talked with us
[1513.20 --> 1514.14]  on the road?
[1514.98 --> 1515.92]  Don't you love that line?
[1516.24 --> 1516.72]  Were our hearts
[1516.72 --> 1517.94]  not burning within us
[1517.94 --> 1518.56]  while Jesus
[1518.56 --> 1520.04]  told us the story,
[1520.36 --> 1521.38]  the one who fulfilled it,
[1521.38 --> 1522.60]  hiding his identity
[1522.60 --> 1523.12]  from us,
[1523.40 --> 1525.04]  telling us how he fulfills
[1525.04 --> 1526.08]  God's plan
[1526.08 --> 1526.72]  from the beginning?
[1527.84 --> 1528.80]  And I happen to think
[1528.80 --> 1529.42]  that that phrase
[1529.42 --> 1530.40]  captures the testimony
[1530.40 --> 1531.72]  of millions of Christians
[1531.72 --> 1533.22]  throughout the generations,
[1533.64 --> 1534.80]  all in their own way,
[1534.88 --> 1535.66]  coming to faith
[1535.66 --> 1536.80]  in all different ways
[1536.80 --> 1537.86]  as they hear the gospel,
[1538.14 --> 1539.10]  as they hear the story,
[1539.16 --> 1539.86]  as they worship.
[1540.12 --> 1540.88]  All of a sudden
[1540.88 --> 1541.44]  they realize
[1541.44 --> 1543.56]  this Jesus is risen.
[1544.50 --> 1545.90]  This Jesus is real.
[1546.22 --> 1548.22]  This Jesus walks with us
[1548.22 --> 1549.64]  today by his spirit
[1549.64 --> 1550.86]  and his story
[1550.86 --> 1552.10]  is our story.
[1552.96 --> 1553.66]  And I think it's worth
[1553.66 --> 1554.68]  pausing this morning
[1554.68 --> 1557.20]  and giving thanks
[1557.20 --> 1558.70]  that we,
[1559.02 --> 1560.02]  as brothers and sisters
[1560.02 --> 1561.24]  of faith in Jesus
[1561.24 --> 1561.82]  this morning,
[1562.10 --> 1563.08]  are here.
[1564.20 --> 1565.78]  That what they believed
[1565.78 --> 1567.04]  as they broke bread
[1567.04 --> 1567.54]  with Jesus,
[1567.80 --> 1568.44]  we believe.
[1569.30 --> 1570.60]  And that as they had been,
[1570.72 --> 1571.70]  their eyes were opened
[1571.70 --> 1572.14]  by Jesus,
[1572.26 --> 1573.40]  so have ours.
[1574.14 --> 1575.84]  By the power of his spirit,
[1575.94 --> 1577.52]  which is no less amazing
[1577.52 --> 1578.98]  than sitting across the table
[1578.98 --> 1579.90]  from Jesus himself.
[1580.62 --> 1581.30]  And I have to say,
[1581.38 --> 1582.42]  when we watched that video
[1582.42 --> 1583.46]  of the students
[1583.46 --> 1584.18]  in our church
[1584.18 --> 1586.02]  sharing the creed,
[1586.54 --> 1587.98]  professing those ancient words,
[1588.04 --> 1589.36]  one of the few confessions,
[1589.88 --> 1590.54]  the Apostles' Creed,
[1590.60 --> 1591.52]  that unites Christians
[1591.52 --> 1592.18]  around the world,
[1592.42 --> 1593.84]  as I listened to these students
[1593.84 --> 1595.26]  profess those words,
[1595.62 --> 1596.16]  I thought,
[1596.56 --> 1597.22]  praise the Lord.
[1598.52 --> 1600.18]  They share in the story
[1600.18 --> 1601.16]  of these two travelers.
[1601.66 --> 1602.98]  That story is theirs,
[1603.06 --> 1604.86]  and this is the true story
[1604.86 --> 1605.98]  that's taken hold
[1605.98 --> 1606.84]  of our hearts
[1606.84 --> 1607.76]  and gives us
[1607.76 --> 1608.88]  resurrection hope.
[1611.98 --> 1613.54]  This story does not end
[1613.54 --> 1615.84]  with two apost travelers
[1615.84 --> 1617.44]  staring across the table
[1617.44 --> 1618.06]  from one another
[1618.06 --> 1618.80]  giving thanks
[1618.80 --> 1619.68]  that they met Jesus.
[1621.30 --> 1622.84]  It continues on to them
[1622.84 --> 1624.22]  putting their sandals back on
[1624.22 --> 1625.80]  and taking to the road
[1625.80 --> 1626.44]  on foot,
[1626.60 --> 1627.40]  probably running
[1627.40 --> 1628.20]  their hearts out
[1628.20 --> 1629.10]  to do what?
[1630.50 --> 1631.04]  To do what?
[1631.64 --> 1632.94]  To tell the apostles
[1632.94 --> 1635.02]  that Jesus is risen.
[1635.22 --> 1636.02]  And I love this part.
[1636.08 --> 1636.96]  This is verse 33.
[1637.54 --> 1638.76]  We're told that they got up
[1638.76 --> 1639.84]  and returned at once
[1639.84 --> 1640.48]  to Jerusalem.
[1640.82 --> 1641.86]  There they found the eleven
[1641.86 --> 1642.74]  and those with them.
[1642.84 --> 1643.72]  They assembled together
[1643.72 --> 1644.10]  and said,
[1644.38 --> 1645.92]  it is true.
[1646.22 --> 1647.20]  The Lord has risen
[1647.20 --> 1648.16]  and he has appeared
[1648.16 --> 1649.06]  to Simon.
[1649.54 --> 1651.82]  Hope has been restored.
[1654.04 --> 1654.50]  And Luke,
[1654.62 --> 1655.64]  in a very creative way,
[1655.70 --> 1656.66]  I think already there,
[1656.72 --> 1657.08]  is saying,
[1657.48 --> 1658.48]  if you know
[1658.48 --> 1660.22]  what has happened,
[1660.22 --> 1662.72]  if you know
[1662.72 --> 1664.56]  that the grave is empty
[1664.56 --> 1665.40]  and if you know
[1665.40 --> 1666.68]  that this is the Messiah
[1666.68 --> 1667.34]  that was promised,
[1667.52 --> 1668.34]  this is the Messiah
[1668.34 --> 1669.34]  who defeated the power of sin,
[1669.60 --> 1671.16]  you automatically
[1671.16 --> 1672.84]  become a witness.
[1673.92 --> 1675.28]  You automatically
[1675.28 --> 1676.16]  become someone
[1676.16 --> 1677.04]  who shares
[1677.04 --> 1678.10]  the good news.
[1678.42 --> 1679.28]  You automatically
[1679.28 --> 1680.76]  get your whole life
[1680.76 --> 1682.38]  turned upside down
[1682.38 --> 1683.44]  and now learn
[1683.44 --> 1684.08]  how to live
[1684.08 --> 1685.62]  in the kingdom of God
[1685.62 --> 1686.88]  and share
[1686.88 --> 1688.84]  the risen Savior.
[1688.84 --> 1691.32]  And I just want to say,
[1691.42 --> 1692.02]  if you think
[1692.02 --> 1692.94]  that Easter Sunday
[1692.94 --> 1694.52]  is the only time
[1694.52 --> 1694.90]  in the year
[1694.90 --> 1695.82]  where we gather together
[1695.82 --> 1696.84]  and we celebrate this,
[1696.94 --> 1697.56]  you're missing,
[1698.02 --> 1698.82]  you are missing
[1698.82 --> 1700.58]  what this celebration
[1700.58 --> 1701.40]  is all about.
[1701.84 --> 1702.66]  The empty tomb
[1702.66 --> 1704.10]  changes everything.
[1704.70 --> 1705.82]  It changes history.
[1706.30 --> 1707.34]  It changes your friendships.
[1707.56 --> 1708.36]  It changes your work.
[1708.44 --> 1709.32]  It changes your family.
[1709.44 --> 1710.78]  It changes the city.
[1710.78 --> 1712.56]  It changes the globe.
[1713.86 --> 1714.98]  This is not just something
[1714.98 --> 1715.88]  we gather together
[1715.88 --> 1716.80]  one Sunday a year
[1716.80 --> 1717.10]  and say,
[1717.26 --> 1717.44]  yay,
[1717.56 --> 1718.48]  he rose from the dead.
[1718.48 --> 1720.94]  This changes everything.
[1722.54 --> 1723.80]  And if there's one thing
[1723.80 --> 1724.80]  I want to say this morning
[1724.80 --> 1726.40]  that it must do
[1726.40 --> 1727.32]  in the lives
[1727.32 --> 1728.04]  of the church,
[1728.50 --> 1729.18]  of you and me
[1729.18 --> 1729.76]  as believers,
[1730.36 --> 1732.82]  it must give us hope.
[1734.12 --> 1735.04]  It must.
[1737.12 --> 1738.60]  The earliest apprentices,
[1739.06 --> 1739.82]  they went back
[1739.82 --> 1740.68]  to broken cities.
[1741.04 --> 1741.78]  Many of them went back
[1741.78 --> 1742.30]  to Rome
[1742.30 --> 1743.64]  where Caesar still claimed
[1743.64 --> 1744.50]  to be the God.
[1744.74 --> 1745.40]  He still claimed
[1745.40 --> 1746.02]  to be the ruler.
[1746.02 --> 1746.80]  He still claimed
[1746.80 --> 1748.64]  to be the son of a God.
[1749.42 --> 1750.58]  And these believers
[1750.58 --> 1752.00]  defiantly,
[1752.34 --> 1754.04]  audaciously knew
[1754.04 --> 1755.92]  that all of that
[1755.92 --> 1756.56]  was a scam.
[1757.36 --> 1758.80]  And they defiantly,
[1759.76 --> 1761.62]  ambitiously hoped
[1761.62 --> 1764.12]  that Jesus would come
[1764.12 --> 1765.70]  and restore his world.
[1766.40 --> 1767.94]  And we take our place
[1767.94 --> 1769.90]  along those early believers
[1769.90 --> 1771.84]  as being the people of hope
[1771.84 --> 1774.16]  who know that the true king
[1774.16 --> 1775.42]  who we sung already,
[1775.52 --> 1777.38]  that all kingdoms bow before,
[1777.52 --> 1778.90]  all rulers will bow before,
[1779.16 --> 1780.28]  that true king is coming.
[1781.12 --> 1782.20]  He's not in the grave.
[1782.76 --> 1783.56]  He's returning.
[1784.06 --> 1785.46]  And he has promised
[1785.46 --> 1787.74]  to make all things new.
[1787.74 --> 1790.38]  He has already sealed the deal
[1790.38 --> 1791.16]  in his resurrection
[1791.16 --> 1792.62]  that the new creation
[1792.62 --> 1792.64]  that the new creation
[1792.64 --> 1793.16]  is coming.
[1793.44 --> 1794.50]  And we are the people
[1794.50 --> 1797.32]  who wait in hope.
[1799.28 --> 1800.76]  And so I finish this morning
[1800.76 --> 1801.42]  by saying,
[1802.68 --> 1803.52]  Christ has come.
[1805.00 --> 1806.50]  Christ has conquered.
[1808.18 --> 1809.14]  Christ has risen.
[1810.20 --> 1812.50]  And he is coming again.
[1813.46 --> 1814.20]  Let's pray.
[1814.20 --> 1818.88]  Father, we pause
[1818.88 --> 1821.30]  and we take in
[1821.30 --> 1822.88]  the reality
[1822.88 --> 1823.98]  that the tomb is empty.
[1825.42 --> 1826.54]  And we pause
[1826.54 --> 1827.44]  to give thanks
[1827.44 --> 1828.06]  for the way
[1828.06 --> 1830.46]  that you have
[1830.46 --> 1831.70]  defeated death.
[1832.58 --> 1834.02]  You have risen victorious
[1834.02 --> 1835.04]  and the life
[1835.04 --> 1836.12]  of the new creation
[1836.12 --> 1837.00]  is here.
[1837.92 --> 1838.86]  Thank you, Jesus.
[1840.28 --> 1841.18]  We pray
[1841.18 --> 1842.22]  that we would be
[1842.22 --> 1842.82]  the people
[1842.82 --> 1843.66]  who this morning
[1843.66 --> 1844.78]  are filled with hope
[1844.78 --> 1847.08]  even in this season
[1847.08 --> 1849.04]  and become heralds
[1849.04 --> 1849.68]  and witnesses
[1849.68 --> 1851.32]  to the life
[1851.32 --> 1852.22]  of the resurrection.
[1853.18 --> 1853.52]  Amen.
