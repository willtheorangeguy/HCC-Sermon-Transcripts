[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Thank you.
[92.00 --> 94.00]  Thank you.
[122.00 --> 124.00]  Thank you.
[152.00 --> 154.00]  Thank you.
[182.00 --> 184.00]  Thank you.
[212.00 --> 214.00]  Thank you.
[242.00 --> 244.00]  Thank you.
[244.00 --> 246.00]  Thank you.
[246.00 --> 248.00]  Thank you.
[248.00 --> 250.00]  Thank you.
[250.00 --> 252.00]  Thank you.
[252.00 --> 254.00]  Thank you.
[254.00 --> 256.00]  Thank you.
[256.00 --> 280.00]  How long till your children find their rest? How long till you drive them to your rest? Be gone, holding to your promises. How long?
[280.00 --> 305.00]  Till you wipe away the tears from every eye. Till you see our home descending from the sky. Do we wait and pray?
[305.00 --> 310.00]  Jesus, give us hope again.
[314.00 --> 329.00]  How long till your word will still be strong? How long till you bear your mighty arm?
[329.00 --> 339.00]  How long till you come? Till you snatch us from the thorns. How long?
[339.00 --> 364.00]  How long till you wipe away the tears from every eye. Till we see our home descending from the sky. Do we wait in pain?
[364.00 --> 369.00]  Jesus, give us hope again.
[369.00 --> 374.00]  How long till you are in pain?
[374.00 --> 379.00]  How long till you are in pain?
[379.00 --> 385.00]  How long till your heart will fall?
[385.00 --> 390.20]  Weak our hearts by the swarnest
[390.20 --> 393.02]  We're walking on
[393.02 --> 397.06]  Read that cloud of the incense
[397.06 --> 400.06]  Bow away
[400.06 --> 412.50]  Till you wipe away the tears from every eye
[412.50 --> 420.18]  Till we see our hope descending from the sky
[420.18 --> 426.00]  Till we wait in pain
[426.00 --> 431.50]  Jesus, give us hope again
[431.50 --> 437.54]  Amen, Jesus, come
[437.54 --> 444.22]  Amen, Jesus, come
[444.22 --> 448.90]  Amen, Jesus, come
[448.90 --> 452.84]  Amen, Jesus, come
[452.84 --> 460.46]  Amen, Jesus, come
[460.46 --> 462.82]  Amen, Jesus, come
[462.82 --> 467.04]  Amen, Jesus, come
[467.04 --> 470.62]  You may be seated.
[480.04 --> 481.06]  Good morning, Hope.
[481.58 --> 485.70]  My name is Peter Aisman, and I'll be doing the candle lighting for us this morning.
[486.54 --> 490.94]  As we light the candle of love this morning, let me read from the writing of John.
[491.42 --> 493.96]  For God so loved the world that he gave his only son,
[493.96 --> 497.64]  that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
[498.32 --> 501.40]  For God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world,
[501.70 --> 505.46]  but in order that the world might be saved through him.
[506.44 --> 508.22]  John 13, verse 34.
[508.74 --> 511.56]  A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another.
[512.18 --> 516.16]  Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.
[517.88 --> 521.68]  At this time, I was told I could feel free to share a brief story
[521.68 --> 524.16]  of how God was present in a challenging time in my life.
[524.74 --> 528.36]  And so throughout this week, I thought a lot about what story I would share with you all today.
[529.00 --> 531.78]  As I look back at my life and all the challenging times,
[532.10 --> 533.12]  I realize something.
[533.66 --> 535.66]  There have been a lot of challenging times.
[537.02 --> 540.40]  It was hard to pinpoint one particular moment in the midst of many,
[540.80 --> 543.48]  but I remember near the end of high school
[543.48 --> 546.94]  when I was going through a really rough patch involving multiple different things.
[546.94 --> 551.30]  And what I particularly remember was that I was thinking at that time,
[551.42 --> 553.52]  I remember asking myself questions such as,
[553.84 --> 554.38]  where is he?
[554.86 --> 555.64]  Where's God?
[555.78 --> 556.88]  Is he even seeing this?
[557.12 --> 557.72]  Is he present?
[557.90 --> 558.60]  Does he care?
[559.20 --> 560.30]  Does he really love me?
[560.92 --> 563.10]  But the challenging time had to get a lot worse
[563.10 --> 565.34]  before it got better to get where I am today,
[565.52 --> 566.54]  standing in front of all of you.
[568.18 --> 569.24]  And I'll tell you something.
[569.46 --> 572.02]  Thinking back on those days, I do laugh sometimes.
[572.32 --> 573.00]  I truly do.
[573.00 --> 576.76]  Because I was so blind to the fact that God was so present in those moments.
[577.06 --> 578.76]  Like he was working within my story,
[578.88 --> 580.20]  and he was calling me towards himself,
[580.32 --> 582.28]  and he was doing everything out of his love for me.
[582.46 --> 583.76]  And I just didn't see it at all.
[584.42 --> 587.70]  Even throughout all the messiness, darkness, and brokenness that was my life,
[588.24 --> 591.40]  God, because he loves us, ignited this beautiful flame
[591.40 --> 593.96]  that created light for the whole world, for you and me,
[594.16 --> 596.32]  that ultimately saved me one night.
[597.06 --> 599.48]  I'm happy that even though I gave up on him,
[599.68 --> 600.76]  he never gave up on me.
[600.76 --> 604.20]  I learned from those challenging times as well.
[604.54 --> 608.56]  And in short, I learned to trust and to know that God truly does love me
[608.56 --> 610.20]  and is always present in my life
[610.20 --> 612.24]  and is always working to pull me closer.
[612.60 --> 614.08]  And that will never change.
[614.52 --> 616.82]  And that is true for all of you as well,
[617.16 --> 618.06]  because he loves us.
[619.50 --> 620.76]  Will you join me in prayer?
[622.48 --> 624.54]  Oh God, help us to believe in beginnings.
[625.36 --> 627.32]  Help us to be a beginning to others,
[627.80 --> 629.48]  a befriender of the friendless,
[629.48 --> 633.14]  to become a beginning of hope and love for the despairing,
[633.14 --> 634.78]  of assurance for the doubting,
[635.14 --> 637.30]  of reconciliation for the divided,
[637.80 --> 640.12]  to become a beginning of freedom for the oppressed,
[640.50 --> 642.10]  of comfort for the sorrowing,
[642.34 --> 643.68]  of friendship for the forgotten,
[644.16 --> 645.48]  of gentleness for the angry,
[645.88 --> 647.10]  of wholeness for the broken,
[647.82 --> 650.90]  of peace for the frightened and violent of the earth,
[650.90 --> 653.10]  so that we may not just grow old,
[653.32 --> 654.06]  but grow new.
[654.56 --> 656.82]  Each day of this wild, amazing life,
[656.90 --> 657.74]  you call us to live,
[658.24 --> 659.82]  with the hope of Jesus Christ.
[660.38 --> 660.64]  Amen.
[660.64 --> 660.78]  Amen.
[663.16 --> 665.08]  This morning we light the candle of love.
[665.46 --> 668.62]  May we live in the world with the very love of Jesus Christ.
[677.96 --> 678.46]  Thank you.
[678.52 --> 682.28]  Will you stand with us as we sing a piece of this salvation story
[682.28 --> 684.50]  of the King of Kings who loved us so deeply
[684.50 --> 687.58]  that He came into our darkness to bring the light.
[687.58 --> 704.38]  In the darkness we were waiting
[704.38 --> 708.66]  Without hope, without light
[708.66 --> 712.26]  Till from heaven you came running
[712.26 --> 716.46]  There was mercy in your eyes
[716.46 --> 720.56]  To fulfill the law and prophets
[720.56 --> 724.52]  To a virgin came the world
[724.52 --> 728.50]  From a throne of endless glory
[728.50 --> 732.72]  To a cradle in the dirt
[732.72 --> 742.80]  Praise the Father
[742.80 --> 746.48]  Praise the Son
[746.48 --> 750.52]  Praise the Spirit
[750.52 --> 754.24]  Three in one
[754.24 --> 758.38]  God of glory
[758.38 --> 760.92]  Majesty
[760.92 --> 763.18]  Hope the Father
[763.18 --> 764.80]  Mary is forever
[764.80 --> 767.32]  To a king
[767.32 --> 771.40]  A king
[771.40 --> 778.44]  To reveal the kingdom coming
[778.44 --> 782.40]  And to reconcile the laws
[782.40 --> 785.96]  To redeem the whole creation
[785.96 --> 790.10]  You did not despise the cause
[790.10 --> 797.68]  For even in your suffering, you sought to rule the other side
[797.68 --> 804.90]  Knowing this was our salvation, Jesus, for our sake, goodbye
[804.90 --> 818.96]  Praise the Father, praise the Son
[818.96 --> 826.54]  Praise the Spirit, three in one
[826.54 --> 833.20]  God of glory, majesty
[833.20 --> 841.96]  Praise forever to the King of kings
[841.96 --> 854.70]  And the morning that you rose, all of heaven held its breath
[854.70 --> 861.54]  Till that stone was moved for good, for the Lamb had conquered death
[861.54 --> 870.54]  And the day rose from their tombs, and the angels turned it on
[870.54 --> 877.54]  For the souls of all who come, to the Father all restored
[877.54 --> 885.54]  Now the source of life was born, and the spirit of faith
[885.54 --> 887.54]  And the spirit of faith
[887.54 --> 892.54]  So to the Lord, shall not hear, shall not pray
[892.54 --> 896.54]  Praise the Lord, and the name of His name
[896.54 --> 899.54]  And His freedom I obey
[899.54 --> 903.54]  For the love of Jesus Christ
[903.54 --> 909.54]  Who has resurrected in my name
[909.54 --> 929.30]  Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, free and free.
[929.30 --> 952.66]  God, glory, love us, praise the Son, praise forever to the King of kings.
[959.30 --> 965.46]  We praise you, Jesus.
[966.62 --> 975.04]  You have so much love, so much deep love, that you would come into our darkness and rescue us.
[976.94 --> 985.74]  We praise you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, for the salvation that started when you were born.
[985.74 --> 990.92]  And it will be finished. We know it. We trust it. We believe it.
[992.28 --> 993.42]  When you come again.
[996.72 --> 997.24]  Amen.
[1015.74 --> 1030.74]  Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1030.74 --> 1033.42]  Hallelujah.
[1033.42 --> 1043.56]  Christ the Savior of the world, He has come.

[1285.24 --> 1288.24]  You may be seated.
[1293.24 --> 1307.24]  The grade 4 to 7 youth are invited to launch upstairs in the youth room.
[1307.24 --> 1314.24]  So if you are in grade 4 to 7, you're welcome to join them upstairs in the youth room at that side of the church.
[1314.24 --> 1318.24]  And you guys can go have a seat before we pray. Thank you.
[1318.24 --> 1329.24]  Thank you.
[1329.24 --> 1332.24]  Good morning. Hope.
[1332.24 --> 1336.24]  I'm welcome to see everyone again.
[1336.24 --> 1343.24]  Such a privilege once again this morning to be leading us in this prayer session.
[1343.24 --> 1351.24]  Just before I pray, I just want to let us know that we have the answers to people's prayers.
[1351.24 --> 1362.24]  You know, God Almighty, we won't come down to give us some of the things we're asking for.
[1362.24 --> 1368.24]  So I want us to be sensitive this period. Just look around you. Look around your circle.
[1368.24 --> 1374.24]  Someone, somewhere praying for something and you feel it in your spirit to, you know, be of help.
[1374.24 --> 1375.24]  Why not?
[1375.24 --> 1380.24]  So we do have the answers to people's prayers. I just want you all to know that.
[1380.24 --> 1384.24]  This morning, I have three prayer points.
[1384.24 --> 1388.24]  We'll be thanking God for His goodness to our church.
[1388.24 --> 1390.24]  No doubt it's been so good to us.
[1390.24 --> 1401.24]  And we'll be praying for those struggling right now with different types of illnesses, depression and loneliness.
[1401.24 --> 1405.24]  And we'll also be praying for our children and our youth.
[1405.24 --> 1411.24]  So you can join me. Pray in your heart. Pray aloud. Whichever one you want to do.
[1411.24 --> 1413.24]  So let's bow our heads for prayers this morning.
[1413.24 --> 1425.24]  God Almighty, we thank you. You've been so faithful.
[1425.24 --> 1432.24]  Despite our unfaithfulness, you have remained so, so faithful to us.
[1432.24 --> 1437.24]  Thank you for your goodness to our church and our community.
[1437.24 --> 1443.24]  Thank you for our ministries, how they have served your church, served the people.
[1443.24 --> 1447.24]  Thank you for our finances as a church.
[1447.24 --> 1450.24]  And thank you for the leadership of this church.
[1450.24 --> 1455.24]  Thank you for the various, the diverse gifts you have blessed us with.
[1455.24 --> 1460.24]  You have indeed provided us with everything that we need.
[1460.24 --> 1464.24]  We have come back as a church to say thank you, Lord.
[1464.24 --> 1477.24]  We pray for those, those struggling right now with depression, loneliness, different types of healiness, Lord.
[1477.24 --> 1482.24]  We know it's a time of expectations, a time of reflection.
[1482.24 --> 1489.24]  And it's a time where we'll be celebrating, you know, Christmas as a family, as friends together.
[1489.24 --> 1494.24]  But these people might not really have the opportunity or any reason to celebrate.
[1494.24 --> 1503.24]  So Lord, we just pray for this category of people that your spirit will console them, encourage them, and put a smile on their faces.
[1503.24 --> 1506.24]  Like, as humans, we are limited sometimes to do these things.
[1506.24 --> 1512.24]  We don't just know how to go about this, but not when your spirit is available, Lord.
[1512.24 --> 1521.24]  So we ask that you, you reach out to those people and, and, and just give them reasons to be joyful, Lord.
[1521.24 --> 1523.24]  And we pray for our children and youth.
[1523.24 --> 1532.24]  Oh God, we pray that you would raise them to be faithful followers of Jesus and witnesses to the good news of Jesus.
[1532.24 --> 1534.24]  A lot is happening right now around the world.
[1534.24 --> 1538.24]  So we commit our children and our youth into your hands.
[1538.24 --> 1543.24]  Use them, guide them, direct them, lead them in the way that they should go.
[1543.24 --> 1550.24]  So when they are fully grown up, Lord, they will not depart from, um, those Christian values.
[1550.24 --> 1554.24]  Father, we thank you and we, we bring all of these prayers before you this morning.
[1554.24 --> 1557.24]  In Jesus name, amen.
[1557.24 --> 1562.24]  And lastly, I just have a little announcement to make.
[1562.24 --> 1566.24]  Like we know, we're coming to the end of another ministry season.
[1566.24 --> 1569.24]  And God has been so, so faithful to us.
[1569.24 --> 1570.24]  He has been so generous.
[1570.24 --> 1573.24]  He blessed us with, with, with a lot.
[1573.24 --> 1578.24]  So I just want to encourage you to give to the ministries of the church.
[1578.24 --> 1586.24]  Um, it's, it's an essential practice for believers to, to give, you know.
[1586.24 --> 1592.24]  So, so, um, and interestingly, we have, uh, the web program in Honduras.
[1592.24 --> 1596.24]  And we also have, uh, the flood relief, um, stuff to going on.
[1596.24 --> 1598.24]  So what, what a, what a time to give.
[1598.24 --> 1603.24]  So we have, uh, you can go online, you can use a debit machine just around the corner there.
[1603.24 --> 1608.24]  And, uh, do so and, and, and God the praise.
[1608.24 --> 1610.24]  God bless you all.
[1610.24 --> 1611.24]  Thank you.
[1611.24 --> 1612.24]  Thank you.
[1612.24 --> 1613.24]  Thank you.
[1613.24 --> 1614.24]  Thank you.
[1614.24 --> 1615.24]  Thank you.
[1615.24 --> 1616.24]  Thank you.
[1616.24 --> 1617.24]  Thank you so much.
[1617.24 --> 1618.24]  We'll give you a moment to kudos to you.
[1618.24 --> 1619.24]  Thank you very much.
[1619.24 --> 1620.24]  Thank you.
[1620.24 --> 1621.24]  Thank you very much.
[1621.24 --> 1622.24]  Thank you very much.
[1622.24 --> 1623.24]  Thank you very much.
[1623.24 --> 1624.24]  Thank you.
[1624.24 --> 1629.24]  Good morning.
[1629.24 --> 1633.24]  It's, uh, so good to be with you.
[1633.24 --> 1638.24]  And, um, I just wanna thank all the, uh, musicians and all the people who were singing.
[1638.24 --> 1644.24]  I mean, I just felt, my heart was just stirred with the, the, the magnitude of this story that
[1644.24 --> 1654.86]  and so thank you so much and let's just give a round of applause we are we are
[1654.86 --> 1662.14]  so blessed with so many gifted people what a wonderful thing that is I wasn't
[1662.14 --> 1665.88]  supposed to be preaching this morning but I got a call from Pastor Dave on
[1665.88 --> 1675.96]  Friday that he was sick and so he said you're on and so here I am not as much
[1675.96 --> 1682.92]  time to prepare as I normally would have so forgive me if I I don't seem as on as
[1682.92 --> 1686.82]  I hopefully normally am maybe maybe this is going to even be better I don't know
[1686.82 --> 1695.78]  we'll find out as Joe said Christmas is a great time to give blessings and to
[1695.78 --> 1700.88]  share of our abundance for the world to a lot of people love to give during this
[1700.88 --> 1706.50]  time of Christmas and as mentioned we we are giving as a church to the the three
[1706.50 --> 1711.56]  wells in Honduras last time I got an update there was 20,000 already given
[1711.56 --> 1716.96]  toward those three wells and then for the flood relief and about 11,000 already
[1716.96 --> 1720.32]  was given so these are and we've distributed a lot of that money already
[1720.32 --> 1724.94]  too so these are these monies are being put to really good use and we encourage
[1724.94 --> 1735.78]  you to to give generously giving is really an act of worship you know and
[1735.78 --> 1739.28]  we're gonna look this morning at the story of the wise men and they brought
[1739.28 --> 1743.04]  gifts right the gold frankincense and myrrh and there was profoundness to those
[1743.04 --> 1749.40]  gifts and so giving for you too and for all of us it's it's an act of worship it's a
[1749.40 --> 1754.92]  profound thing to do this morning I want to talk a little bit about how Jesus
[1754.92 --> 1759.54]  entered a real world and you may say well that's kind of obvious but you know you
[1759.54 --> 1766.08]  think of a world of politics and economics and conflict his birth takes place in an
[1766.08 --> 1773.58]  oppressive Empire the Roman Empire his birth is revolutionary you know sometimes
[1773.58 --> 1779.40]  you know we may we it feels like we we don't grab that and and and I think we
[1779.40 --> 1785.52]  need to this his birth is subversive to a system and and so I want to talk a little
[1785.52 --> 1788.64]  bit about that this morning we're in this series on blessing and I want to talk
[1788.64 --> 1794.58]  about how God blesses in the midst of brokenness and weakness and struggle and
[1794.58 --> 1798.58]  talk a little bit about that so let's read it's a little bit of a longer piece but
[1798.58 --> 1804.28]  out of Matthew 2 let's read Matthew story of the the coming of the wise men
[1804.28 --> 1810.04]  after Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the time of King Herod
[1810.04 --> 1814.72]  magi sometimes called wise men sometimes called kings from the east came to
[1814.72 --> 1818.38]  Jerusalem and asked where is the one who has been born King of the Jews we saw
[1818.38 --> 1822.46]  his star and when it rose and have come to worship him well when King Herod heard
[1822.46 --> 1829.40]  this he was disturbed and all of Jerusalem with him when he had called
[1829.40 --> 1832.74]  together all the people's chief priests and the teachers of the law he asked
[1832.74 --> 1836.98]  them where is the Messiah where the Messiah was to be born and in Bethlehem in
[1836.98 --> 1840.46]  Judea they replied for this is what the prophet in the Old Testament had written
[1840.46 --> 1845.08]  but you Bethlehem in the land of Judah but are by no means least among the rulers of
[1845.08 --> 1851.22]  Judah for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people well then
[1851.22 --> 1856.46]  Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time of the star
[1856.46 --> 1860.10]  had appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem he said go and search carefully
[1860.10 --> 1864.18]  for the child as soon as you find him reports me so that I too may go and
[1864.18 --> 1869.64]  worship him and hopefully you're saying liar liar right this is not his intent at
[1869.64 --> 1874.24]  all and after they heard the king they they went on their way and the star they
[1874.24 --> 1877.72]  had seen when it rose went ahead of them and until it stopped over the place where
[1877.72 --> 1881.80]  the child was and when they saw the star they were overjoyed and on coming to the
[1881.80 --> 1886.48]  house they saw the child with his mother Mary and they bowed down and worshiped him
[1886.48 --> 1890.20]  then they opened up their treasures and presented him with the gifts of gold
[1890.20 --> 1894.96]  frankincense and myrrh and having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod
[1894.96 --> 1901.98]  they returned to their country by another route and bless you and and when they had
[1901.98 --> 1907.14]  gone an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream get up he said take
[1907.14 --> 1911.04]  the child and his mother and escape to Egypt stay there until I tell you for
[1911.04 --> 1916.68]  Herod is going to search for the child to kill him so he got up took the child and
[1916.68 --> 1920.34]  his mother during the night and left for Egypt and where he stayed until the
[1920.34 --> 1923.70]  death of Herod and so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the
[1923.70 --> 1928.32]  prophets out of Egypt I called my son and when Herod realized that he had been
[1928.32 --> 1932.64]  outwitted by the Magi he was furious and he gave orders to kill all the boys in
[1932.64 --> 1938.22]  Bethlehem in its vicinity who were two years old and under just imagine in
[1938.22 --> 1941.88]  accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi and then what was said
[1941.88 --> 1945.66]  through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled a voice is heard in Ramah
[1945.66 --> 1949.44]  weeping in great mourning Rachel weeping for her children refusing to be
[1949.44 --> 1954.56]  comforted because they are no more
[1954.56 --> 1960.14]  in the world and so on Matthew places Jesus in the time of King Herod he's
[1960.14 --> 1967.64]  called Herod the Great an impressive guy and a dangerous guy not fully Jewish but
[1967.64 --> 1973.58]  he pulls enough strings so that Rome makes him King he rules with an iron
[1973.58 --> 1979.76]  fist and has a strong military force to back up whatever he wants he crushes all
[1979.76 --> 1985.40]  opposition he even had had two of his sons killed and one wife because he was
[1985.40 --> 1991.10]  suspicious of them he's a tyrant yet he's a genius when it comes to impressive
[1991.10 --> 1995.78]  architecture he rebuilds the temple he builds some Colosseum he makes all kinds
[1995.78 --> 2004.90]  of amazing stuff and and he's he is all about money and power and prestige those are
[2004.90 --> 2011.38]  things he would call blessings at least he feels blessed and people don't question
[2011.38 --> 2015.82]  him and it says here in the past we read that Herod is very disturbed when he
[2015.82 --> 2019.42]  hears of a king of the Jews that has been born somewhere and he finds out it's
[2019.42 --> 2025.72]  Bethlehem and he he knows enough that that a Christ a Messiah was to come that was
[2025.72 --> 2030.58]  the prophecy we heard some of them and that and that sounds like opposition to
[2030.58 --> 2037.00]  Herod who is suspicious by nature and he wouldn't call that blessing in fact the
[2037.00 --> 2039.94]  whole city is disturbed by the news because now there's the potential for
[2039.94 --> 2045.04]  trouble and that's going to upset things and rumors are flying and this this is
[2045.04 --> 2053.62]  the context that God sends his son into he's born in a little hick town to some
[2053.62 --> 2062.98]  unknown teenage girl and that supposedly is going to rival the power and the wealth
[2062.98 --> 2070.90]  of Herod it sounds like such an unlikely threat doesn't it a poor baby in some ways
[2070.90 --> 2074.92]  we've taken this Christmas story and we've kind of polished it up and the
[2074.92 --> 2079.86]  thought mythologized it so it seems more sacred and a little less messy and a
[2079.86 --> 2085.98]  little less earthy and Matthew wants us to see the reality of it all he wants he
[2085.98 --> 2092.70]  wants us to see it's a gritty story in real life and and what you know we we
[2092.70 --> 2098.88]  have a tendency to miss the subversiveness of the story Bethlehem's one claim to
[2098.88 --> 2103.74]  fame one claim to fame was King David came from there those are here were last week
[2103.74 --> 2107.86]  or listening online right last week I talked about King David and how David wanted
[2107.86 --> 2113.20]  you know build a temple for for for God and get him out of the tent that he was
[2113.20 --> 2118.00]  in and David set an agenda and then God said listen it's all about my agenda not
[2118.00 --> 2122.60]  yours so don't pretend you know what's going on and and so this is this is the
[2122.60 --> 2126.74]  kids and then God said this is going to be an eternal kingdom not something that
[2126.74 --> 2131.08]  you temporarily put together for now and and David grew up there in Bethlehem and
[2131.08 --> 2136.84]  he came from there this is where the Prophet Samuel anointed him king and out of his
[2136.84 --> 2142.92]  line comes Jesus but the truth is that most people on that day would say well
[2142.92 --> 2146.08]  you know what where important people live important important people live in
[2146.08 --> 2151.96]  Jerusalem Bethlehem that's a weak place that's a nothing place and Jesus is born
[2151.96 --> 2160.40]  there in an animal stable to a teenage girl who had to get married God isn't
[2160.40 --> 2166.22]  exactly showing off your Izzy you know I mean the ten plagues no that was
[2166.22 --> 2170.84]  impressive the opening of the Red Sea who man now that that that's something you
[2170.84 --> 2182.82]  can make into a movie this is kind of lame isn't it a baby from a teenage girl and
[2182.82 --> 2189.26]  we're reminded here that God doesn't show up in the obvious ways of power that we
[2189.26 --> 2196.66]  might want him to his blessings are often subtle and often aligned with the weak he
[2196.66 --> 2200.48]  doesn't he chooses not to go ahead to head with Herod in the way Herod would
[2200.48 --> 2208.58]  would suspect God's kingdom is shown strong in weakness you know we too are
[2208.58 --> 2213.26]  impressed with blessings like like money and power and prestige and popularity and
[2213.26 --> 2220.66]  all kinds of stuff and God stands back from all that entirely unimpressed you ever wonder how you know
[2220.66 --> 2228.26]  how how the Almighty looks at us I was reading out of Isaiah and I thought I'd share it with you Isaiah 40 a
[2228.26 --> 2237.76]  voice says cry out and I said what shall I cry and this is what God said all people are like grass and all their
[2237.76 --> 2242.66]  faithfulness like the flowers of the field the grass withers the flowers fall because the breath of the Lord blows blows on the
[2242.66 --> 2261.82]  blows on them surely the people are grass the grass withers the flowers fall but the word of God endures forever and I think the writer reminds us we're frail people with a relatively short
[2261.82 --> 2268.58]  short lifespan. Not as much power as we like to think we have. And God is supreme. And
[2268.58 --> 2277.32]  God is God. And God writes His Son into human history in a place of weakness, humanly speaking.
[2277.32 --> 2282.14]  But He writes with a sovereign pen. And so no matter what the Herods of the world do,
[2282.14 --> 2287.26]  God is still in charge because He is God alone. And He shows up where He pleases and He answers
[2287.26 --> 2293.08]  dreams and He sends angels and He'll see His plan succeed because He is the Lord. And
[2293.08 --> 2298.20]  when we read, as we did in the series about Abraham receiving, he would be a blessing to
[2298.20 --> 2302.76]  all the nations when Israel would come. And out of that nation would eventually come Christ.
[2302.76 --> 2307.26]  Yeah, the world is blessed here because God is in charge throughout the whole history of
[2307.26 --> 2315.26]  mankind. And His plans subvert human attempts to have their own plans take the place. And
[2315.26 --> 2320.08]  He undermines them all. And He stands with the weak. And He takes on human flesh. And
[2320.08 --> 2325.72]  He joins the poor. And He joins the oppressed. And He wanders the earth as a poor carpenter
[2325.72 --> 2333.08]  turned teacher who eventually takes His place on a cross, a symbol of defeat. And there He
[2333.08 --> 2345.08]  cries out, in victory, it is finished. The plan is fulfilled in Jesus.
[2345.08 --> 2349.90]  And that's whose birth we celebrate. And that real peace is brought to the world through
[2349.90 --> 2355.54]  Him. And not the Pax Romana, the Roman peace that really wasn't peace at all. This Christmas
[2355.54 --> 2362.90]  story is a subversive story. It is a turned upside down transformation of all things. I mean,
[2362.90 --> 2369.90]  talk about blessings. And the question really is, how do we answer that story? Well, first
[2369.90 --> 2375.72]  of all, we need to acknowledge and get honest about how much time we spend in Herod's court.
[2375.72 --> 2381.62]  We're shaped by Herod-like thinking. We're impressed with power and wealth and position and prestige
[2381.62 --> 2388.70]  and popularity. And we have to kind of admit that, don't we? I buy what I want because I can.
[2389.32 --> 2395.82]  That's strength, right? That shows some kind of power, doesn't it? Those are the blessings,
[2396.00 --> 2402.50]  right? And they are kind of, but not really. Because I'm grateful for what I have. I'm grateful
[2402.50 --> 2407.78]  for what God has given me and those small blessings. But the real blessing is Emmanuel.
[2409.00 --> 2413.46]  God with us. God in charge of history. And all that other stuff is just stuff.
[2415.54 --> 2421.74]  And we need to see strength in taking our stand in our own weakness and with the weak.
[2421.74 --> 2430.06]  God sent His Son to the world and nothing's the same again, ever. Because He is the blessing.
[2432.78 --> 2438.16]  And we get to stand with the weak and we get to admit our weaknesses. And you know why that's a
[2438.16 --> 2445.94]  blessing? Because then we don't have to posture. And then we can surrender. Because we don't have to
[2445.94 --> 2453.28]  be strong because the Lord is strong. Thank you. And that's why Paul writes in 2 Corinthians.
[2453.36 --> 2457.28]  Look at it with me. Paul can write this. The great apostle Paul. And God said to Paul,
[2457.72 --> 2463.12]  but he said to me, my grace is sufficient, right? Because you need grace. My grace is sufficient
[2463.12 --> 2471.94]  for you. My power is made perfect where? In weakness. In weakness. Therefore, I will boast
[2471.94 --> 2476.88]  all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that Christ's power may rest in me. And you see how
[2476.88 --> 2482.84]  this goes. Right? You see how this goes. When I admit I need a Savior, I get a Savior.
[2483.94 --> 2488.92]  If I'm going to be my own Savior, I don't need a Savior, do I? And you see where surrender comes
[2488.92 --> 2494.10]  in on that. And that's what Paul writes again in 1 Corinthians 12. But God chose the foolish
[2494.10 --> 2498.92]  things of the world to shame the wise, at least the so-called wise. And God chose the weak
[2498.92 --> 2502.80]  things of the world to shame the strong. Because when we rest on our own strength,
[2503.02 --> 2504.34]  it doesn't work.
[2509.00 --> 2514.56]  And when we get this, when we get this, when that sinks in, then we begin to see the pain
[2514.56 --> 2519.42]  and the brokenness around us and in us. And we want to enter into it in order to make a difference.
[2519.42 --> 2528.22]  And then we realize when we are blessed, then we get to bless. And we help fulfill that circle
[2528.22 --> 2539.20]  of blessing. This is about worshiping a different king. The king who is the blessed one. A king
[2539.20 --> 2545.38]  with a kingdom that will stand forever, unlike Herod's kingdom, which is long gone. Now, I
[2545.38 --> 2552.72]  want you to understand this too. There will be costs in following this king, with his subversive
[2552.72 --> 2559.86]  kingdom. There will be costs in bringing blessings to the weak and standing alongside the weak. Right?
[2559.86 --> 2565.34]  Even in this story, we see what power, the horrible cost of challenging power. And we see the horrible
[2565.34 --> 2573.98]  cost with the children of Bethlehem because of Herod's kingdom and his ego. Jesus said, Jesus said,
[2573.98 --> 2581.36]  if you follow me, it'll cost you. Jesus said, deny yourself. I'd love to see a Christmas card with
[2581.36 --> 2586.40]  that on the front. You know, right? So you enjoy the world, peace on earth, beautiful things. But
[2586.40 --> 2589.82]  what, wouldn't that be something you've got a Christmas card on the front that says, deny yourself?
[2591.96 --> 2598.10]  I don't know. A lot of people say, what kind of Christmas card is this? An honest one. An honest one.
[2598.10 --> 2605.98]  You know, Jesus said, pick up your cross and follow me. Because somehow, that's where the deep blessings
[2605.98 --> 2610.14]  are. When you pick up your cross, when you pick up your challenges, your difficulties, your struggles,
[2610.32 --> 2616.02]  you pick them up and you follow and surrender to the one who brings true blessing. That's what counts.
[2618.58 --> 2622.66]  You know, somehow we can fall into the trap of making life, the life of following Jesus,
[2622.66 --> 2624.90]  all about a cozy, comfortable life without conflict.
[2628.10 --> 2629.22]  That's not true.
[2631.56 --> 2635.56]  We're called to enter into weakness and somehow there's the blessings.
[2637.92 --> 2642.76]  If you stand with Jesus, you stand on the other side of power, as the world defines it.
[2643.28 --> 2645.62]  And you define blessings in such different ways.
[2646.80 --> 2648.16]  Jesus often says, give it away.
[2649.22 --> 2650.36]  Money, life, power.
[2650.96 --> 2652.52]  That's the new power in Christ.
[2652.90 --> 2656.48]  We, you know what, and we get disturbed, you know, Herod was disturbed, Jerusalem was disturbed.
[2656.48 --> 2660.40]  We get disturbed by what Jesus calls us to sometimes too, don't we?
[2660.66 --> 2661.96]  You know, what about my needs?
[2662.02 --> 2663.10]  What about my comforts, my wants?
[2663.72 --> 2665.18]  Blessings as the world defines.
[2667.70 --> 2672.60]  And then, and when we see, you know, the economy kind of struggling and sputtering and,
[2672.94 --> 2677.98]  and we see COVID not going away, then we can feel pretty insecure sometimes too.
[2678.04 --> 2680.78]  And we see the job losses and the shaking investments and health problems.
[2680.78 --> 2685.54]  And it's tough to be on the other side of power, isn't it?
[2685.64 --> 2686.72]  At least it seems like it.
[2687.86 --> 2691.84]  And Jesus walks into, and he comes to us, he walks into this and he said, there's a king
[2691.84 --> 2694.30]  who rules everything forever.
[2695.68 --> 2697.42]  And that's security.
[2698.96 --> 2699.62]  That's security.
[2700.72 --> 2702.06]  We follow Jesus, our king.
[2702.06 --> 2707.98]  And like him, we are a generous people, blessed to be a deep blessing to others.
[2709.02 --> 2710.92]  And so then we hold life loosely.
[2711.58 --> 2716.78]  And we give, and we serve, and we sacrifice, because we live in and for another kingdom,
[2717.16 --> 2720.04]  one that's blessings are forever and deep.
[2720.98 --> 2724.14]  And we trust a king who enters weakness and brings life.
[2724.34 --> 2727.14]  And we pay the cost to follow our king into his kingdom,
[2727.14 --> 2732.30]  because he has come to liberate all things and make all things new.
[2732.60 --> 2736.26]  He didn't come just to bring a nice merry season for us.
[2740.34 --> 2742.78]  And he comes to bring, we have these candles lit,
[2742.82 --> 2746.44]  he comes to bring peace to all and joy to all and love to all and hope for all.
[2750.92 --> 2753.48]  Herod's kingdom ended and Rome's kingdom ended.
[2753.58 --> 2754.56]  You can go look at the ruins.
[2754.56 --> 2758.50]  God's kingdom has no end.
[2759.60 --> 2764.00]  And God writes the story, not Herod, not power as the world defines it.
[2764.80 --> 2767.46]  It is God's subversive forever story.
[2768.18 --> 2770.54]  And we are called to be a part of it.
[2774.02 --> 2780.56]  Let me read you a piece by an author and philosopher named Sorn Kierkegaard.
[2781.18 --> 2784.06]  And he writes this about the story that we read out of Matthew.
[2784.56 --> 2785.46]  He writes,
[2785.46 --> 2791.18]  Although the scribes that were trying to figure out where Jesus was born and all that.
[2791.38 --> 2793.98]  Although the scribes could explain where the Messiah should be born,
[2794.52 --> 2797.50]  they remained quite unperturbed in Jerusalem.
[2798.50 --> 2800.86]  They did not accompany the wise men to seek him.
[2801.50 --> 2805.30]  Similarly, we may know the whole of Christianity yet make no movement.
[2806.26 --> 2809.46]  The power that moved heaven and earth leaves us completely unmoved.
[2809.46 --> 2811.60]  What a difference.
[2811.60 --> 2815.08]  The three kings, the magi, had only a rumor to go by.
[2815.44 --> 2815.62]  Right?
[2815.82 --> 2816.42]  That star.
[2817.26 --> 2819.18]  But it moved them to make that long journey.
[2819.50 --> 2822.08]  The scribes were much better informed, much better versed.
[2822.30 --> 2824.76]  They sat and they studied scriptures like so many dons.
[2824.92 --> 2827.28]  But it did not make them move.
[2827.28 --> 2829.96]  Who had more truth?
[2830.32 --> 2835.56]  The three kings who followed a rumor or the scribes who remained sitting with all their knowledge?
[2836.58 --> 2838.96]  What a vexation it must have been for the kings.
[2839.18 --> 2843.60]  That the scribes who gave the news they wanted remained quiet in Jerusalem.
[2843.60 --> 2846.40]  We are being mocked, the kings might have thought.
[2846.62 --> 2851.42]  For indeed, what an atrocious self-contradiction that the scribes should have knowledge yet remain still.
[2852.68 --> 2858.92]  This is as bad as if a person knows all about Christ and his teachings and his own life expresses the opposite.
[2860.20 --> 2866.84]  We are tempted to suppose that such a person wishes to fool us unless we admit that he is only fooling himself.
[2866.84 --> 2872.84]  This story needs to move us.
[2875.92 --> 2877.12]  It needs to move us.
[2880.02 --> 2881.56]  It's not just another Christmas.
[2884.02 --> 2887.14]  Jesus said, fear not for I am with you to the very end.
[2888.08 --> 2893.64]  And even with a lousy economy or even in pain and struggle or fears of COVID,
[2893.64 --> 2898.08]  his kingdom has come and his reign will be forever.
[2899.68 --> 2900.56]  It will be forever.
[2902.16 --> 2904.02]  And let's live in that reality.
[2905.16 --> 2907.02]  And let's fear not because of him.
[2907.62 --> 2909.16]  And let's follow Jesus our king.
[2909.98 --> 2911.50]  No matter what the cost.
[2911.96 --> 2915.78]  So that we can live out blessed lives and be a blessing.
[2916.62 --> 2917.62]  Would you pray with me?
[2917.62 --> 2923.84]  Father God, we come before you.
[2924.82 --> 2928.92]  And we thank you so much for your profound subversive story.
[2929.62 --> 2933.94]  Of sending your son into the world to transform and renew all things.
[2935.06 --> 2937.68]  Lord, may we not settle for just a merry Christmas.
[2937.68 --> 2944.06]  But may we seek to live in the profoundness of your kingdom come and coming.
[2944.06 --> 2947.44]  Father, may we be moved.
[2948.52 --> 2949.68]  May we take actions.
[2950.60 --> 2953.50]  May we receive the blessings in our weaknesses.
[2954.22 --> 2959.76]  And allow ourselves to be transformed so we can go be blessings and weaknesses around us.
[2960.64 --> 2962.60]  Lord, we hold your name high.
[2963.28 --> 2965.72]  And we praise you for coming to us.
[2966.40 --> 2967.50]  And being our blessing.
[2967.64 --> 2968.28]  In Jesus' name.
[2968.88 --> 2969.14]  Amen.
[2969.14 --> 2969.28]  Amen.
[2974.06 --> 2977.32]  Advent is a time of waiting.
[2977.82 --> 2983.00]  And we are waiting not like people who don't know what's coming.
[2983.42 --> 2984.58]  Our future is secure.
[2985.10 --> 2986.82]  We believe that because of Christ Jesus.
[2987.74 --> 2988.94]  And so we wait in hope.
[2989.76 --> 2994.92]  This short chorus that we're going to sing is a psalm.
[2995.58 --> 2996.94]  And you're welcome to sing it.
[2997.02 --> 3001.18]  Or you're welcome to just reflect on it and listen as we sing it through.
[3001.18 --> 3005.50]  We'll sing it three times so you can join us by the third time if you feel comfortable.
[3005.50 --> 3007.50]  We wait in hope.
[3007.50 --> 3008.88]  We wait in hope.
[3008.88 --> 3013.12]  For the Lord is our help.
[3013.12 --> 3015.12]  And our shield.
[3015.12 --> 3019.12]  We wait in hope.
[3019.12 --> 3020.12]  We wait in hope.
[3020.12 --> 3024.88]  We wait in hope.
[3024.88 --> 3031.12]  For the Lord is our help.
[3031.12 --> 3035.12]  And our shield.
[3035.12 --> 3065.10]  We wait in hope.
[3065.10 --> 3071.10]  For the Lord is our help.
[3071.10 --> 3076.10]  And our shield.
[3076.10 --> 3085.10]  In Him our hearts rejoice.
[3085.10 --> 3087.10]  For we trust.
[3087.10 --> 3087.32]  For we trust.
[3087.32 --> 3091.10]  In His holy name.
[3091.10 --> 3093.10]  We wait in hope.
[3093.10 --> 3095.10]  For the Lord is our help.
[3095.10 --> 3097.10]  And our shield.
[3097.10 --> 3099.10]  For the Lord is our help.
[3099.10 --> 3101.10]  And our shield.
[3101.10 --> 3103.10]  For the Lord is our help.
[3103.10 --> 3105.10]  And our shield.
[3105.10 --> 3106.10]  And our shield.
[3106.10 --> 3107.10]  And our shield.
[3107.10 --> 3109.10]  And our shield.
[3109.10 --> 3111.10]  And our shield.
[3111.10 --> 3116.92]  Waiting hope for the Lord.
[3117.48 --> 3123.28]  He is our help and our shield.
[3123.28 --> 3131.28]  In Him our hearts rejoice.
[3133.44 --> 3140.28]  For we trust in His only name.
[3141.10 --> 3171.08]  For we trust in His only name.
[3171.10 --> 3173.10]  For we trust in His only name.
[3173.10 --> 3175.10]  For we trust in His only name.
[3175.10 --> 3177.10]  For we trust in His only name.
[3177.10 --> 3179.10]  For we trust in His only name.
[3179.10 --> 3181.10]  For we trust in His only name.
[3181.10 --> 3183.10]  For we trust in His only name.
[3183.10 --> 3184.44]  And to share what you have.
[3184.44 --> 3186.44]  For we trust in His only name.
[3186.44 --> 3188.44]  And to share what you have.
[3188.44 --> 3190.44]  And to share what you have.
[3190.44 --> 3191.64]  And receive the Lord's blessings.
[3191.64 --> 3193.30]  And then we're going to sing that blessing.
[3195.08 --> 3197.24]  This is out of the book of Numbers.
[3198.44 --> 3201.64]  May the Lord bless you and keep you.
[3202.44 --> 3205.54]  May the Lord make His face shine upon you.
[3205.94 --> 3207.54]  And be gracious to you.
[3208.44 --> 3211.28]  May the Lord turn His face towards you.
[3211.28 --> 3214.28]  And give you His peace.
[3214.28 --> 3216.06]  Amen.
[3241.28 --> 3243.28]  All right.
[3243.28 --> 3244.28]  All right.
[3244.28 --> 3246.32]  My is to be apostles.
[3246.32 --> 3258.08]  The Lord bless you and keep you
[3258.08 --> 3262.62]  Make his face shine upon you
[3262.62 --> 3265.62]  And be gracious to you

[3296.36 --> 3303.36]  The Lord turn his face toward you
