• Introduction by Jenna Fabiano, pastor at Willoughby CRC
• Discussion of opening up the book of Ephesians for study
• Explanation of Paul's shift from describing the church's calling to living out that calling
• Contextual relevance of Ephesians in times of crisis (COVID-19)
• Overview of Ephesians 4:1-16, focusing on unity and maturity in Christ
• Exegesis of key passages in Ephesians 4:1-16
• The mature body of Christ is the head, and from him, the whole body grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work.
• Paul's initial push in Ephesians is to live a life worthy of the calling received, which is not about what one does but who they are.
• The calling is an identity in Christ, being image bearers and sons/daughters of God who have been given insight about Jesus.
• The fullness of Christ, filled with Jesus, is the calling, to be a dwelling where God's spirit lives.
• Our calling is to be filled with Christ in him and he in us.
• The speaker has a calling on their life and emphasizes the importance of living worthily
• Two main responsibilities for the church to live out this calling: unity and maturity
• Unity is deeply connected to the spirit and requires humility, gentleness, love, patience, and effort
• The spirit is the bond or adhesive that holds the body together and gives it life
• Without the breath of the spirit, the body cannot hold together and will be dead
• The importance of maintaining the unity of the spirit through peace
• Division and quarrelling within communities hinders the witness of the Holy Spirit
• Allowing division to persist is destructive to the body of Christ
• Unity does not require uniformity, but rather a lack of rivalries and conflicts
• Cultural values have infiltrated the church, making people overly sensitive and dramatic in their interactions
• The unity of God implies the unity of the church
• Paul's passage emphasizes making every effort to remember our calling and common purpose in Christ
• The unity of the church is indestructible and reflects the truth that there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one church
• Historically, the church has struggled with division and polarization
• Having multiple churches in different pockets of a city can be a strength if they learn to speak well about each other and work together
• The stain on the church is not having many churches but how they have spoken to and about one another
• The speaker discusses how churches have failed to partner and pray for one another due to emphasizing differences.
• An Eastern Orthodox priest's statement is recalled: "our similarities far outweigh our differences."
• The importance of unity in the body of Christ, as mentioned in Ephesians 4:1-6, is highlighted.
• Paul's explanation of how this unified body is meant to look, shifting from unity into maturity, is discussed.
• Psalm 68 is quoted and applied to Jesus' ascension, emphasizing God's gift-giving nature.
• The church is being filled with Jesus' presence through gifts given by him
• Paul explains the purpose of these gifts: to equip the church for service and build it up until unity in faith and knowledge of Christ is reached
• Maturity in Christ is the goal, evidenced by a deep understanding and permeation of Jesus' presence
• Immaturity is characterized by being tossed about by new trends and teachings
• Speaking truth in love will lead to maturity and growth as a unified body of Christ
• The importance of unity and maturity in Christ's body
• How each member has value, gifting, and a means to live out their calling
• The role of specific gifting in empowering and encouraging other gifts
• The need for every part of the body to do its work and function together
• How a lack of unity can lead to conflict and underutilization of gifts
• The importance of recognizing and utilizing individual gifts within the church.
• The importance of taking each other seriously and not taking ourselves too seriously
• Considering how others are gifted and how their gifts can align with yours for the good of the community
• Living a life worthy of one's calling, which is living into the fullness of Christ
• Christian humility and love as foundational to unity and growth in the church
• Seeking unity and oneness with God, leading to a healthier body where members are codependent on one another
• Growing into maturity through acknowledging our need for one another
• The importance of following the paradigm set by Paul to attain the full measure of Christ
• The tendency to skip steps and pursue only the end goal, but the need to follow each step for true growth
• The prayer of Paul in Ephesians for the church to be filled with Jesus and reflect his fullness
• The need to know one's calling as a member of the body of Christ and spare no effort to pursue unity and maturity
• The gift of the Holy Spirit within believers, allowing them to breathe together as one body under Christ's head.
• Repeated use of the word "Amen" in an apparent devotional or prayer context.
