[0.00 --> 7.98]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[8.24 --> 10.86]  It is good to gather around the Word this morning.
[11.94 --> 13.28]  Before we open the Scriptures,
[13.52 --> 16.92]  I just want to say a couple words about this thing called a rule of life.
[17.76 --> 19.78]  You're going to be hearing more about this in the coming weeks,
[20.00 --> 23.22]  and what we want to do is, as a whole church community,
[23.22 --> 27.30]  we want to do as a sort of capstone project for this sermon series
[27.30 --> 30.18]  is develop and write out this thing called a rule of life.
[30.30 --> 35.00]  A rule of life is putting our desire to grow as disciples on our calendar.
[35.82 --> 38.38]  It's taking these practices that we've learned and saying,
[38.84 --> 42.56]  here's when we, as a family or I, as an individual, want to do them,
[42.60 --> 46.34]  and it's scheduling out our discipleship on our daily calendar,
[46.56 --> 48.44]  our weekly calendar, and our yearly calendar.
[49.34 --> 52.76]  And in many ways, a rule of life is a way of saying,
[53.10 --> 55.22]  here's how in my ordinary day,
[55.22 --> 57.50]  I want Christ to rule my life.
[58.22 --> 59.36]  So we're going to resource you.
[59.44 --> 61.12]  We're going to be sending out resources,
[61.44 --> 62.88]  and on Tuesday, we're going to be posting a video
[62.88 --> 65.48]  of how Misha, our youth pastor, has written out her rule of life,
[65.90 --> 68.56]  and we hope that all of us can participate in this
[68.56 --> 70.92]  and really practice what it is that we're preaching through
[70.92 --> 72.68]  in this series on Apprenticing with Jesus.
[74.20 --> 75.96]  We will continue in this series,
[75.96 --> 78.36]  and we're looking specifically now at the practices
[78.36 --> 82.00]  that ground us in the grace and the mercy of Jesus.
[82.00 --> 84.18]  And the practice that we're looking at this morning
[84.18 --> 86.38]  is the very popular practice of confession.
[87.46 --> 90.18]  Second only to fasting, which I'm preaching on next week,
[90.58 --> 91.56]  which I should subtitle,
[91.64 --> 94.38]  How to Kill Your Livestream Audience 1 and 2.
[95.14 --> 96.34]  But to look at confession,
[96.44 --> 98.34]  I invite you to turn with me to Matthew 6.
[98.42 --> 99.72]  We're going to read the Lord's Prayer,
[99.86 --> 101.84]  and then over to 1 John 1.
[104.22 --> 105.58]  This is Matthew 6.
[105.58 --> 110.66]  This, then, is how you should pray.
[111.76 --> 113.30]  Our Father in heaven,
[114.26 --> 115.78]  hallowed be your name.
[116.60 --> 117.76]  Your kingdom come.
[118.56 --> 121.50]  Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[122.34 --> 124.08]  Give us today our daily bread,
[124.60 --> 126.36]  and forgive us our debts
[126.36 --> 128.94]  as we have forgiven our debtors.
[129.82 --> 131.18]  Lead us not in temptation,
[131.78 --> 134.12]  but deliver us from the evil one.
[134.12 --> 139.10]  And then over to 1 John 1, verse 8 and 9.
[141.96 --> 143.92]  If we claim to be without sin,
[144.46 --> 146.00]  we deceive ourselves,
[146.24 --> 148.02]  and the truth is not in us.
[148.88 --> 150.58]  If we confess our sins,
[150.98 --> 152.62]  He is faithful and just
[152.62 --> 154.36]  and will forgive our sins
[154.36 --> 157.98]  and purify us from all unrighteousness.
[157.98 --> 165.76]  I want to begin with a very basic question,
[165.88 --> 167.02]  and that is to invite you
[167.02 --> 168.98]  to bring to mind
[168.98 --> 171.62]  the first association with confession.
[172.74 --> 174.20]  What is the first thing
[174.20 --> 175.52]  that pops into your imagination
[175.52 --> 177.98]  when you think of that word confession?
[177.98 --> 181.80]  I'm guessing at least some of us
[181.80 --> 184.56]  are imagining some kind of interrogation room
[184.56 --> 185.46]  with low lighting
[185.46 --> 186.92]  where a detective is grilling
[186.92 --> 189.48]  some guilty culprit of some crime committed.
[189.48 --> 191.86]  I'm guessing some of us
[191.86 --> 192.58]  might be imagining
[192.58 --> 194.82]  sort of a big Catholic church
[194.82 --> 196.52]  with that wooden confession booth
[196.52 --> 197.94]  that you often see in movies.
[198.42 --> 199.62]  I see a nodding head here.
[200.50 --> 202.78]  And perhaps you're imagining that time
[202.78 --> 204.62]  where you did something at home
[204.62 --> 205.60]  or you broke something
[205.60 --> 206.42]  or stole something,
[206.86 --> 208.46]  and you went through that painful process
[208.46 --> 210.26]  of your parents forcing out of you
[210.26 --> 211.14]  a confession.
[211.14 --> 215.16]  Most of us, if I had to guess,
[215.84 --> 217.54]  have a negative association
[217.54 --> 218.92]  with this thing of confession.
[219.68 --> 221.26]  Most of us don't want to think
[221.26 --> 222.48]  or imagine confession
[222.48 --> 224.70]  because it brings up bad things, perhaps.
[226.38 --> 228.62]  One of the authors that we read
[228.62 --> 229.86]  in the forming of this series,
[229.96 --> 231.12]  his name is James K. Smith,
[231.32 --> 232.32]  and he wrote a book called
[232.32 --> 233.36]  You Are What You Love.
[234.50 --> 235.38]  And in his book,
[235.42 --> 236.08]  You Are What You Love,
[236.12 --> 236.90]  he's got this heading
[236.90 --> 238.60]  that actually caught my attention
[238.60 --> 239.46]  because the heading was
[239.46 --> 241.08]  The Gift of Confession.
[242.14 --> 244.52]  And in true James K. Smith style,
[244.60 --> 245.96]  he goes through a variety of films.
[246.10 --> 247.70]  He's a very big film buff.
[248.14 --> 250.06]  And he shows how in so many films,
[250.14 --> 251.48]  films that you and I love,
[251.86 --> 253.50]  the linchpin, the turning point
[253.50 --> 255.74]  of the whole story is confession.
[256.66 --> 258.22]  How the moment that defines
[258.22 --> 258.98]  the rest of the story
[258.98 --> 260.48]  that leads to change and transformation
[260.48 --> 262.32]  is when someone names
[262.32 --> 263.68]  the crime that's committed,
[264.18 --> 266.00]  the sin done, the hurt caused.
[266.00 --> 268.12]  And that's the point at which
[268.12 --> 269.26]  we see change.
[269.26 --> 271.50]  And one of the questions
[271.50 --> 273.00]  that James Smith asks
[273.00 --> 274.50]  that I quite like is,
[275.00 --> 276.86]  if confession is so powerful,
[277.98 --> 279.18]  why don't we practice it?
[279.70 --> 280.90]  And I want to read for you a quote.
[281.02 --> 282.50]  This is actually from a detective
[282.50 --> 283.88]  in a film that he loves.
[283.96 --> 284.44]  And the detective,
[284.64 --> 286.62]  after grilling a certain criminal,
[286.72 --> 287.50]  he comes out of the room
[287.50 --> 289.02]  and he says to one of his coworkers,
[289.02 --> 293.70]  look, everybody knows
[293.70 --> 294.94]  there's something wrong with them.
[295.30 --> 296.76]  They just don't know what it is.
[297.64 --> 299.72]  Everybody wants confession.
[300.50 --> 303.02]  Everybody wants a cathartic narrative for it,
[303.08 --> 304.56]  especially the guilty.
[305.50 --> 308.00]  And everybody is guilty.
[309.76 --> 310.84]  What do you think of that?
[311.90 --> 313.98]  Everybody wants confession.
[315.34 --> 316.90]  Everybody is guilty.
[316.90 --> 318.78]  And if that's true,
[318.88 --> 319.64]  Jamie Smith says,
[319.80 --> 321.04]  why don't we practice
[321.04 --> 322.64]  this thing of confession?
[323.06 --> 324.58]  And more curiously,
[324.62 --> 324.90]  he says,
[325.20 --> 325.94]  could it be
[325.94 --> 327.04]  that confession
[327.04 --> 327.86]  could be one of the most
[327.86 --> 329.06]  liberating things
[329.06 --> 330.68]  our neighbors could experience
[330.68 --> 332.82]  as part of a worship service
[332.82 --> 334.30]  where Christians bring
[334.30 --> 335.26]  the brokenness
[335.26 --> 336.72]  before their loving father?
[338.28 --> 340.30]  What role does confession have
[340.30 --> 341.70]  in your life as an apprentice?
[342.64 --> 344.30]  What role should it have
[344.30 --> 345.94]  in the apprenticing community?
[345.94 --> 346.88]  And what does Jesus,
[347.04 --> 347.50]  our Savior,
[347.66 --> 348.12]  our Lord,
[348.18 --> 348.78]  and our Teacher
[348.78 --> 351.36]  want us to do
[351.36 --> 352.64]  with confession?
[353.94 --> 354.16]  Well,
[354.20 --> 354.68]  in one of the most
[354.68 --> 355.62]  well-known prayers
[355.62 --> 356.12]  in the Bible,
[356.28 --> 356.92]  perhaps one of the most
[356.92 --> 357.62]  well-known prayers
[357.62 --> 358.96]  in the world,
[359.64 --> 360.56]  Jesus invites us
[360.56 --> 361.66]  to practice confession.
[362.60 --> 364.68]  Forgive us our debts
[364.68 --> 366.44]  as we have forgiven
[366.44 --> 367.22]  our debtors.
[368.34 --> 369.56]  A number of writers
[369.56 --> 370.86]  suggest that this petition
[370.86 --> 371.82]  in the Lord's Prayer
[371.82 --> 374.10]  is both the boldest petition
[374.10 --> 375.60]  and it's also the most
[375.60 --> 376.76]  demanding petition.
[377.64 --> 379.34]  Clean our slate, Lord.
[380.08 --> 381.76]  Wipe clean our lies.
[381.92 --> 382.86]  Forgive our sin.
[383.08 --> 384.32]  Cancel our debt.
[385.10 --> 386.10]  That's a bold request.
[387.16 --> 387.84]  And equally,
[388.10 --> 388.94]  it is demanding,
[389.42 --> 390.38]  may we be people
[390.38 --> 391.24]  who then go
[391.24 --> 392.38]  and do what Jesus does.
[393.06 --> 393.88]  Cancel the debt
[393.88 --> 394.44]  of those
[394.44 --> 395.98]  who have sinned against us.
[395.98 --> 398.14]  C.S. Lewis
[398.14 --> 399.14]  has famously said
[399.14 --> 400.28]  that we all love
[400.28 --> 402.24]  the notion of forgiveness.
[403.16 --> 404.12]  It's a beautiful thing.
[404.90 --> 405.82]  Until we have someone,
[406.12 --> 407.10]  we have to forgive.
[408.48 --> 409.80]  This is one of those passages
[409.80 --> 410.54]  that invites us
[410.54 --> 411.74]  to do what Jesus does
[411.74 --> 413.32]  and extend the grace
[413.32 --> 414.28]  that we receive.
[415.32 --> 415.68]  Now,
[415.72 --> 416.24]  if you've recited
[416.24 --> 416.84]  the Lord's Prayer,
[416.98 --> 417.48]  you'll know that
[417.48 --> 418.18]  this is the part
[418.18 --> 418.52]  of the prayer
[418.52 --> 419.26]  that gets muddy.
[419.68 --> 420.42]  If you're reciting it
[420.42 --> 420.90]  with a group,
[421.20 --> 421.84]  you hear some people
[421.84 --> 422.46]  say sin,
[422.60 --> 423.78]  some people say debt,
[423.88 --> 425.24]  some people say trespasses,
[425.24 --> 426.36]  and we always resent
[426.36 --> 426.82]  those people
[426.82 --> 427.84]  because it wrecks
[427.84 --> 428.98]  the rhythm of the prayer
[428.98 --> 429.86]  and it's much longer
[429.86 --> 430.48]  and we have to wait
[430.48 --> 431.60]  to get back into sync.
[431.96 --> 432.80]  Those of you who grew up
[432.80 --> 433.52]  reciting it in church,
[433.60 --> 434.52]  you know what I'm talking about.
[435.50 --> 436.80]  When Matthew records
[436.80 --> 437.52]  Jesus' prayer,
[437.70 --> 439.14]  he records the word debt
[439.14 --> 440.94]  and sort of drawing
[440.94 --> 441.76]  from this idea
[441.76 --> 442.84]  of the consumer world
[442.84 --> 443.58]  where you have a debt
[443.58 --> 444.12]  with someone
[444.12 --> 445.14]  and you're boldly,
[445.22 --> 445.58]  in this case,
[445.66 --> 446.78]  asking for it to be canceled.
[447.52 --> 448.38]  When Luke records
[448.38 --> 449.06]  Jesus' prayer,
[449.36 --> 449.98]  the Lord's Prayer
[449.98 --> 450.82]  in Luke chapter 11,
[450.92 --> 452.46]  he uses the word sin.
[453.40 --> 454.50]  And I agree with one writer
[454.50 --> 455.02]  who says,
[455.02 --> 455.68]  both of these
[455.68 --> 457.38]  are aiming at the same thing.
[458.50 --> 459.50]  Forgive us our debts,
[459.66 --> 460.62]  forgive us our trespasses,
[460.76 --> 461.80]  forgive us our sins,
[461.92 --> 463.10]  are all aiming at the way
[463.10 --> 465.36]  in which we have failed God.
[466.24 --> 467.44]  We owe God.
[468.08 --> 469.40]  We have failed to live
[469.40 --> 471.04]  as God designed us
[471.04 --> 471.72]  from the beginning.
[472.54 --> 473.82]  We fail to love Him
[473.82 --> 474.62]  with our whole heart.
[474.68 --> 475.90]  We fail to love our neighbors
[475.90 --> 477.36]  as ourselves
[477.36 --> 478.64]  in so many ways
[478.64 --> 479.50]  of things we do
[479.50 --> 480.84]  and as Marie prayed,
[480.92 --> 482.72]  things that we do not do.
[483.24 --> 483.80]  The neglect,
[484.32 --> 485.10]  the lack of love,
[485.20 --> 485.90]  the lack of care,
[486.00 --> 486.78]  these are all ways
[486.78 --> 487.62]  in which we fail
[487.62 --> 488.84]  to love our Lord.
[489.32 --> 490.42]  And as Matthew records
[490.42 --> 491.18]  in this Lord's Prayer,
[491.26 --> 492.14]  we have a debt
[492.14 --> 493.44]  to God.
[494.38 --> 495.54]  And even as I say that,
[495.60 --> 496.42]  I am so aware
[496.42 --> 497.82]  of how in West Coast,
[497.94 --> 498.84]  postmodern British Columbia,
[498.96 --> 499.88]  we don't think this way,
[499.96 --> 500.84]  we don't talk this way.
[501.04 --> 501.84]  Having a debt
[501.84 --> 502.90]  against God.
[503.74 --> 504.70]  We don't even think
[504.70 --> 505.22]  of lives
[505.22 --> 506.74]  in relationship to God.
[506.86 --> 507.26]  That somehow
[507.26 --> 508.64]  we live our normal lives
[508.64 --> 509.32]  in relation
[509.32 --> 510.50]  to how He's designed us,
[510.50 --> 511.86]  how He's created us to live
[511.86 --> 512.90]  and that there's this way
[512.90 --> 514.80]  that we are supposed to live
[514.80 --> 516.40]  that we are falling short of.
[516.46 --> 517.26]  That's so foreign
[517.26 --> 518.14]  to Canadians' thought.
[518.42 --> 519.32]  Not even to speak
[519.32 --> 519.80]  of this thing
[519.80 --> 520.82]  we call sin.
[522.64 --> 523.48]  One of the great myths
[523.48 --> 524.44]  of Canadian culture
[524.44 --> 526.18]  is this notion
[526.18 --> 527.72]  that we are not born in sin.
[528.48 --> 529.48]  I've always thought
[529.48 --> 530.54]  that once you have a toddler,
[530.66 --> 531.52]  that should just shatter
[531.52 --> 532.24]  this notion
[532.24 --> 533.56]  of being born good.
[533.64 --> 534.00]  But somehow
[534.00 --> 535.06]  we prop up this notion
[535.06 --> 536.14]  that we are born good
[536.14 --> 537.16]  and we are broken
[537.16 --> 539.08]  as other people hurt us.
[539.08 --> 540.66]  And in our passage
[540.66 --> 541.50]  we are confronted
[541.50 --> 542.22]  with the reality
[542.22 --> 542.80]  of our debt,
[543.56 --> 544.20]  of our sin,
[544.74 --> 545.88]  of our trespasses.
[546.24 --> 547.36]  And I agree with Tim Keller
[547.36 --> 548.80]  who says for many people
[548.80 --> 550.14]  when they become Christians
[550.14 --> 552.16]  the gospel is bad news
[552.16 --> 553.46]  before it's good news.
[553.86 --> 554.80]  Because it opens you up
[554.80 --> 556.44]  to this reality of
[556.44 --> 557.28]  whoa,
[558.02 --> 559.94]  I am a sinner.
[560.48 --> 561.58]  I am caught
[561.58 --> 563.02]  in the power
[563.02 --> 563.82]  of this thing,
[564.62 --> 564.86]  sin.
[565.40 --> 566.26]  And I need a Savior.
[566.26 --> 566.38]  I need a Savior.
[568.38 --> 568.76]  Apprentices
[568.76 --> 570.10]  are those who recognize
[570.10 --> 571.04]  that sin is real,
[571.46 --> 572.52]  that it is pervasive,
[572.68 --> 573.38]  it is powerful,
[573.54 --> 575.08]  and we are enslaved to it
[575.08 --> 576.54]  on our own devices.
[577.34 --> 577.96]  And Jesus,
[578.34 --> 579.30]  when he invites us
[579.30 --> 580.70]  to confess our sin,
[581.40 --> 582.36]  knows this.
[582.90 --> 583.58]  And he invites us
[583.58 --> 584.26]  to this practice
[584.26 --> 585.54]  wherein we experience
[585.54 --> 586.56]  his freedom,
[587.16 --> 587.84]  his grace.
[588.40 --> 589.24]  And you need to know
[589.24 --> 590.86]  that Jesus is not introducing
[590.86 --> 592.00]  a brand new practice.
[592.76 --> 593.86]  Confession was built
[593.86 --> 594.78]  into the life
[594.78 --> 595.54]  of God's people
[595.54 --> 596.08]  in the Old Testament.
[596.18 --> 596.58]  The Israelites
[596.58 --> 597.58]  would confess personally,
[597.90 --> 599.00]  they would confess corporately.
[599.14 --> 599.74]  I think some of the most
[599.74 --> 600.56]  powerful passages
[600.56 --> 601.24]  in the Old Testament
[601.24 --> 603.26]  are the entire nation
[603.26 --> 604.34]  of Israel
[604.34 --> 605.36]  confessing sin,
[606.06 --> 607.12]  recommitting their lives
[607.12 --> 607.40]  to the Lord,
[607.54 --> 608.70]  rededicating themselves
[608.70 --> 609.98]  to following in his ways
[609.98 --> 611.24]  and finding life through it.
[611.38 --> 612.20]  That's powerful.
[612.72 --> 613.70]  We don't really have examples
[613.70 --> 615.20]  of that in our current day.
[616.62 --> 617.24]  It was practiced
[617.24 --> 618.12]  throughout Israel's life,
[618.18 --> 618.84]  it was always part
[618.84 --> 619.60]  of the Jewish culture.
[619.74 --> 620.48]  Even when John
[620.48 --> 621.36]  is baptizing people
[621.36 --> 622.06]  in the Jordan River,
[622.44 --> 622.88]  we're told that
[622.88 --> 624.38]  as they received baptism,
[624.38 --> 625.80]  they were confessing
[625.80 --> 626.40]  their sins,
[627.36 --> 628.54]  recognizing their failure,
[628.76 --> 629.88]  recognizing who God is
[629.88 --> 630.36]  and who they are
[630.36 --> 631.32]  and how they are desperately
[631.32 --> 632.70]  needing his grace
[632.70 --> 633.36]  and his mercy
[633.36 --> 634.46]  and his love.
[634.88 --> 636.08]  This is not something new.
[637.26 --> 638.04]  And throughout the history
[638.04 --> 638.62]  of the church,
[639.28 --> 640.22]  confession has been
[640.22 --> 641.80]  a core practice,
[641.86 --> 642.48]  not just something
[642.48 --> 643.60]  that might matter,
[643.86 --> 645.22]  but a core practice
[645.22 --> 646.32]  for those who seek
[646.32 --> 646.84]  to grow
[646.84 --> 648.44]  as apprentices of Jesus.
[648.44 --> 650.34]  And many writers
[650.34 --> 651.06]  I read this week
[651.06 --> 652.62]  says we don't get
[652.62 --> 653.32]  very far
[653.32 --> 655.08]  in our life in Jesus
[655.08 --> 656.96]  without confession.
[657.68 --> 659.14]  We don't experience
[659.14 --> 660.30]  existentially
[660.30 --> 661.64]  the grace of Jesus
[661.64 --> 663.00]  without this practice
[663.00 --> 663.90]  of confession.
[667.42 --> 668.46]  Confession is
[668.46 --> 671.00]  being honest with God.
[671.90 --> 672.76]  Confession is the act
[672.76 --> 673.82]  of really speaking
[673.82 --> 675.58]  not who we wish we were
[675.58 --> 676.34]  and the things
[676.34 --> 677.68]  that we wish we did,
[677.90 --> 678.44]  but the person
[678.44 --> 679.54]  we actually are
[679.54 --> 680.00]  and the things
[680.00 --> 681.14]  we've actually done
[681.14 --> 681.84]  and said.
[682.46 --> 683.84]  It's a deep practice
[683.84 --> 684.56]  in humility.
[685.74 --> 686.14]  And I think
[686.14 --> 687.00]  in the superficial
[687.00 --> 688.90]  sort of presentation
[688.90 --> 689.92]  culture of the West
[689.92 --> 691.54]  it's such a necessary practice.
[691.94 --> 692.88]  We sort of peel off
[692.88 --> 693.32]  the layers,
[693.46 --> 694.46]  peel off the masks,
[694.90 --> 695.36]  move away
[695.36 --> 696.52]  from that curated self
[696.52 --> 697.08]  that you pump
[697.08 --> 697.88]  through social media
[697.88 --> 698.86]  and you speak
[698.86 --> 699.60]  as the person
[699.60 --> 700.88]  you truly are.
[701.64 --> 702.52]  You speak of the things
[702.52 --> 703.60]  you've actually done
[703.60 --> 705.36]  and you name reality.
[706.32 --> 707.22]  The addictions
[707.22 --> 708.00]  you're caught in.
[708.38 --> 709.52]  The desires you have
[709.52 --> 710.20]  that are destructive.
[710.38 --> 711.22]  The words you've spoken
[711.22 --> 712.18]  that have divided
[712.18 --> 713.30]  families and friendships.
[714.30 --> 715.08]  The greed
[715.08 --> 716.28]  that consumes
[716.28 --> 716.96]  your heart.
[717.68 --> 718.88]  The unhealthy relationships
[718.88 --> 720.12]  and all more
[720.12 --> 720.68]  than that.
[723.54 --> 724.36]  Those who have
[724.36 --> 725.28]  practiced confession
[725.28 --> 726.92]  I think will echo
[726.92 --> 727.56]  what I say
[727.56 --> 728.62]  when I say
[728.62 --> 729.80]  that when you practice it
[729.80 --> 730.78]  you realize
[730.78 --> 731.36]  just how much
[731.36 --> 731.84]  you need it.
[731.84 --> 733.58]  you realize
[733.58 --> 734.36]  how good it is
[734.36 --> 735.26]  for the soul
[735.26 --> 736.82]  to confess sin.
[737.52 --> 737.94]  I don't know
[737.94 --> 739.06]  who I first heard this from
[739.06 --> 739.74]  but the image
[739.74 --> 740.72]  of confession
[740.72 --> 742.02]  is like that
[742.02 --> 743.24]  of taking out the trash
[743.24 --> 744.84]  where you drop
[744.84 --> 746.66]  these heavy loads
[746.66 --> 747.64]  of garbage
[747.64 --> 748.84]  before Jesus
[748.84 --> 749.40]  our Savior.
[750.72 --> 751.60]  And those loads
[751.60 --> 752.32]  may be heavy
[752.32 --> 754.02]  but man is it good
[754.02 --> 755.26]  to let go of them
[755.26 --> 756.94]  rather than carry them.
[757.56 --> 758.98]  This is confession.
[758.98 --> 761.96]  One of the most
[761.96 --> 762.70]  well known confessions
[762.70 --> 763.58]  in the entire Bible
[763.58 --> 764.34]  in fact if I could
[764.34 --> 765.02]  preach the sermon
[765.02 --> 765.94]  on Old Testament passage
[765.94 --> 767.40]  it would be on Psalm 51.
[767.62 --> 768.56]  If you don't know Psalm 51
[768.56 --> 769.64]  I do encourage you
[769.64 --> 770.12]  this week
[770.12 --> 770.86]  pull it out
[770.86 --> 772.12]  allow it to be your guide
[772.12 --> 773.22]  in confessing sin.
[773.94 --> 775.00]  Written by King David
[775.00 --> 776.62]  the man who is described
[776.62 --> 778.44]  as after God's own heart.
[779.50 --> 780.36]  Also the man
[780.36 --> 781.36]  who committed adultery
[781.36 --> 782.50]  with a woman named Bathsheba.
[782.90 --> 783.56]  Also the man
[783.56 --> 784.82]  who cleverly got
[784.82 --> 786.16]  her husband murdered
[786.16 --> 787.48]  so that he could have
[787.48 --> 788.52]  to see before himself.
[789.00 --> 790.00]  Serious stuff
[790.00 --> 790.58]  I'd say.
[791.70 --> 792.56]  And in Psalm 51
[792.56 --> 794.86]  we read what David writes
[794.86 --> 796.84]  after his friend Jonathan
[796.84 --> 798.10]  does what a good friend does.
[798.24 --> 798.90]  You know what that is?
[799.62 --> 800.80]  He confronts David
[800.80 --> 802.22]  who is denying it
[802.22 --> 802.68]  who is not really
[802.68 --> 803.20]  dealing with it
[803.20 --> 803.74]  he says David
[803.74 --> 804.76]  you've done this.
[805.68 --> 806.20]  And when David
[806.20 --> 807.10]  finally comes to term
[807.10 --> 807.74]  with his sin
[807.74 --> 808.76]  finally comes to term
[808.76 --> 809.96]  with what he has done
[809.96 --> 811.30]  Psalm 51
[811.30 --> 813.16]  is his confession.
[813.54 --> 814.06]  And I want to read
[814.06 --> 814.76]  just a portion
[814.76 --> 815.74]  of the beginning of it.
[816.16 --> 819.32]  Have mercy on me
[819.32 --> 820.14]  O God
[820.14 --> 821.32]  according to your
[821.32 --> 822.40]  unfailing love
[822.40 --> 823.84]  according to your
[823.84 --> 824.78]  great compassion
[824.78 --> 827.00]  blot out my transgressions
[827.00 --> 829.18]  wash away
[829.18 --> 830.22]  all my iniquity
[830.22 --> 831.08]  and cleanse me
[831.08 --> 831.74]  from my sin
[831.74 --> 832.40]  for I know
[832.40 --> 833.48]  my transgressions
[833.48 --> 834.34]  and my sin
[834.34 --> 835.76]  is always before me
[835.76 --> 837.76]  against you
[837.76 --> 838.98]  you only
[838.98 --> 839.94]  have I sinned
[839.94 --> 840.46]  and done
[840.46 --> 841.80]  what is evil
[841.80 --> 843.30]  in your sight.
[844.36 --> 845.16]  Now I can say
[845.16 --> 846.10]  a lot about this passage
[846.10 --> 846.56]  in fact
[846.56 --> 847.20]  I'd like to preach
[847.20 --> 847.62]  a whole sermon
[847.62 --> 848.32]  on this passage
[848.32 --> 849.16]  but let me just
[849.16 --> 849.86]  highlight two things
[849.86 --> 850.62]  number one
[850.62 --> 852.94]  David is brutally
[852.94 --> 853.50]  honest
[853.50 --> 854.38]  about his sin
[854.38 --> 856.06]  he is not
[856.06 --> 856.80]  minimizing it
[856.80 --> 857.64]  he is not hiding it
[857.64 --> 858.94]  he is not denying it
[858.94 --> 860.14]  he is brutally
[860.14 --> 860.70]  honest
[860.70 --> 861.72]  about his sin
[861.72 --> 864.54]  and he is not
[864.54 --> 865.26]  making excuses
[865.26 --> 867.86]  I think so often
[867.86 --> 869.86]  we avoid confession
[869.86 --> 869.88]  we avoid confession
[869.88 --> 871.08]  because somehow
[871.08 --> 872.20]  we have duped ourselves
[872.20 --> 872.82]  into thinking
[872.82 --> 874.44]  it is not that bad
[874.44 --> 875.50]  you know you think
[875.50 --> 876.12]  of your context
[876.12 --> 877.28]  you start finding reasons
[877.28 --> 878.62]  well my work is difficult
[878.62 --> 879.78]  my marriage is complicated
[879.78 --> 880.48]  I have got really
[880.48 --> 881.28]  broken friendships
[881.28 --> 882.48]  it is very hard
[882.48 --> 883.28]  my life is all
[883.28 --> 883.60]  these things
[883.60 --> 884.44]  that is really why
[884.44 --> 884.76]  I did it
[884.76 --> 885.48]  it is really not
[885.48 --> 886.16]  all that bad
[886.16 --> 887.00]  here is my context
[887.00 --> 888.18]  that explains away
[888.18 --> 889.82]  this sin that I have
[889.82 --> 890.06]  committed
[890.06 --> 891.36]  there is none of that
[891.36 --> 893.10]  in this psalm of confession
[893.10 --> 894.56]  there is honesty
[894.56 --> 897.22]  there is speaking truthfully
[897.22 --> 898.68]  before the face of God
[898.68 --> 900.28]  the one whom David knows
[900.28 --> 902.02]  can forgive his sin
[902.02 --> 906.02]  this week I spent some time
[906.02 --> 907.54]  talking to a counselor
[907.54 --> 908.80]  that I know quite well
[908.80 --> 910.88]  in that conversation
[910.88 --> 911.96]  I shared that I'm preaching
[911.96 --> 913.58]  on confession this Sunday
[913.58 --> 914.96]  when the counselor is a believer
[914.96 --> 916.52]  and was intrigued by the fact
[916.52 --> 917.60]  that I'm preaching on confession
[917.60 --> 918.26]  and just shared
[918.26 --> 919.76]  that in his practice
[919.76 --> 921.72]  he has seen with his own eyes
[921.72 --> 923.30]  over and over and over again
[923.30 --> 925.36]  the power of confession
[925.36 --> 927.72]  the power of speaking
[927.72 --> 929.02]  and naming
[929.02 --> 930.80]  that which you have committed
[930.80 --> 931.78]  that is sinful
[931.78 --> 932.48]  and wrong
[932.48 --> 933.04]  and destructive
[933.04 --> 934.46]  and he said
[934.46 --> 935.44]  very interestingly
[935.44 --> 937.86]  how difficult it is
[937.86 --> 938.60]  to get anywhere
[938.60 --> 939.98]  without confession
[939.98 --> 941.64]  and how many people
[941.64 --> 942.54]  when they finally say
[942.54 --> 943.58]  this is what I did
[943.58 --> 944.46]  this is the adultery
[944.46 --> 944.82]  I committed
[944.82 --> 945.64]  this is the addiction
[945.64 --> 946.30]  I'm caught up in
[946.30 --> 946.98]  before that
[946.98 --> 947.80]  they will admit
[947.80 --> 949.46]  to being eaten away
[949.46 --> 950.52]  by that sin
[950.52 --> 951.80]  eaten away
[951.80 --> 952.92]  by hiding that
[952.92 --> 953.48]  to themselves
[953.48 --> 954.48]  not telling their spouse
[954.48 --> 955.08]  or their family
[955.08 --> 955.66]  or their friends
[955.66 --> 956.90]  and they can't sleep
[956.90 --> 958.02]  they're anxious
[958.02 --> 959.02]  they're frustrated
[959.02 --> 960.04]  they get depressed
[960.04 --> 960.62]  they're poor
[960.62 --> 961.18]  in their friendships
[961.18 --> 961.92]  and their relationships
[961.92 --> 962.72]  there's a sense
[962.72 --> 963.40]  in which the whole
[963.40 --> 964.06]  of their lives
[964.06 --> 964.68]  is sinking
[964.68 --> 965.76]  under the weight
[965.76 --> 967.22]  of not confessing
[967.22 --> 968.98]  and at the moment
[968.98 --> 969.52]  of confession
[969.52 --> 970.46]  there's this relief
[970.46 --> 972.06]  and more than one person
[972.06 --> 972.62]  has said
[972.62 --> 973.62]  to this counselor
[973.62 --> 974.98]  that when they finally
[974.98 --> 976.18]  confessed their sin
[976.18 --> 977.18]  it felt like they took
[977.18 --> 978.88]  a thousand pound weight
[978.88 --> 979.92]  off their shoulders
[979.92 --> 982.58]  and many people
[982.58 --> 984.08]  in his practice
[984.08 --> 984.68]  found themselves
[984.68 --> 986.02]  crying tears of joy
[986.02 --> 987.68]  that they finally
[987.68 --> 988.54]  were able to say
[988.54 --> 990.52]  the thing that's going on
[990.52 --> 993.06]  of course all this echoes
[993.06 --> 994.56]  another psalm of confession
[994.56 --> 995.08]  from David
[995.08 --> 996.04]  which is Psalm 32
[996.04 --> 996.98]  where he says
[996.98 --> 998.10]  when I kept silent
[998.10 --> 999.28]  when I didn't confess
[999.28 --> 1000.32]  when I didn't name
[1000.32 --> 1001.12]  before you God
[1001.12 --> 1001.68]  my sin
[1001.68 --> 1003.84]  my bones wasted away
[1003.84 --> 1005.18]  and I was groaning
[1005.18 --> 1006.20]  all day long
[1006.20 --> 1008.88]  then I confessed my sin
[1008.88 --> 1011.16]  and you forgave me
[1011.16 --> 1014.18]  Jesus our teacher
[1014.18 --> 1015.30]  our savior
[1015.30 --> 1016.44]  our guide
[1016.44 --> 1017.14]  says
[1017.14 --> 1018.92]  confess your sins
[1018.92 --> 1020.76]  bring those before
[1020.76 --> 1021.92]  the only person
[1021.92 --> 1023.12]  who can deal with them
[1023.12 --> 1024.80]  and receive grace
[1024.80 --> 1026.54]  speak honestly
[1026.54 --> 1027.74]  with your heavenly father
[1027.74 --> 1029.48]  learn how to communicate
[1029.48 --> 1030.70]  the true self
[1030.70 --> 1031.38]  that you are
[1031.38 --> 1032.88]  and find his grace
[1032.88 --> 1036.44]  a number of years ago
[1036.44 --> 1037.62]  I read an author
[1037.62 --> 1038.72]  a book by the name of
[1038.72 --> 1040.24]  by Nancy Lee DeMoss
[1040.24 --> 1040.96]  and the book is called
[1040.96 --> 1041.58]  Brokenness
[1041.58 --> 1043.56]  and Nancy Lee DeMoss
[1043.56 --> 1044.78]  had a lot of insight
[1044.78 --> 1046.98]  on the church
[1046.98 --> 1047.46]  in the west
[1047.46 --> 1048.14]  in fact she named
[1048.14 --> 1049.32]  a lot of the superficiality
[1049.32 --> 1050.20]  not just of the culture
[1050.20 --> 1051.08]  but of churches
[1051.08 --> 1053.18]  and of pastors
[1053.18 --> 1054.22]  and the way in which
[1054.22 --> 1055.74]  we sort of live this facade
[1055.74 --> 1057.32]  and she in her book
[1057.32 --> 1057.90]  on brokenness
[1057.90 --> 1058.86]  tries to lead people
[1058.86 --> 1059.96]  to those hard places
[1059.96 --> 1060.56]  of confession
[1060.56 --> 1061.14]  and repentance
[1061.14 --> 1062.54]  so that they can actually
[1062.54 --> 1063.44]  change and grow
[1063.44 --> 1064.88]  and this is what she writes
[1064.88 --> 1065.66]  on brokenness
[1065.66 --> 1068.42]  we all want
[1068.42 --> 1069.90]  a painless revival
[1069.90 --> 1073.20]  we want a laughing revival
[1073.20 --> 1075.50]  resurrection life
[1075.50 --> 1076.74]  without crucifixion
[1076.74 --> 1078.54]  but the way up
[1078.54 --> 1079.70]  is down
[1079.70 --> 1081.76]  revivals do not begin
[1081.76 --> 1082.24]  happily
[1082.24 --> 1084.18]  they begin with hearts
[1084.18 --> 1084.92]  that are broken
[1084.92 --> 1087.26]  we will never meet God
[1087.26 --> 1087.80]  in revival
[1087.80 --> 1088.84]  until we have first
[1088.84 --> 1089.48]  met him
[1089.48 --> 1091.22]  in brokenness
[1091.22 --> 1093.16]  and then she goes on
[1093.16 --> 1094.16]  a few chapters later
[1094.16 --> 1096.16]  God cannot resist
[1096.16 --> 1096.82]  the prayers
[1096.82 --> 1098.40]  of the broken hearted
[1098.40 --> 1100.28]  he cannot ignore
[1100.28 --> 1102.28]  those who cry out
[1102.28 --> 1102.74]  to him
[1102.74 --> 1103.96]  in humility
[1103.96 --> 1105.64]  and desperation
[1105.64 --> 1108.26]  she goes on
[1108.26 --> 1108.94]  to describe
[1108.94 --> 1109.98]  a prayer conference
[1109.98 --> 1110.72]  that she helped
[1110.72 --> 1111.26]  organize
[1111.26 --> 1112.08]  for church leaders
[1112.08 --> 1112.76]  and worship leaders
[1112.76 --> 1113.30]  and pastors
[1113.30 --> 1114.60]  they had a whole weekend
[1114.60 --> 1115.10]  lined up
[1115.10 --> 1115.96]  with big teachers
[1115.96 --> 1116.88]  and preachers
[1116.88 --> 1117.54]  of mega churches
[1117.54 --> 1118.50]  and it started
[1118.50 --> 1119.82]  with a fairly unknown
[1119.82 --> 1120.34]  pastor
[1120.34 --> 1122.54]  leading a time of prayer
[1122.54 --> 1123.46]  and he did
[1123.46 --> 1124.50]  what Marie Currie did
[1124.50 --> 1125.06]  this morning
[1125.06 --> 1125.48]  where he said
[1125.48 --> 1126.06]  I want to just
[1126.06 --> 1126.74]  leave some time
[1126.74 --> 1127.36]  for confession
[1127.36 --> 1129.32]  and he spoke words
[1129.32 --> 1129.80]  of confession
[1129.80 --> 1130.72]  from his own life
[1130.72 --> 1131.88]  and then much
[1131.88 --> 1132.72]  to his own surprise
[1132.72 --> 1133.58]  someone who was there
[1133.58 --> 1134.92]  at this massive conference
[1134.92 --> 1136.02]  started confessing
[1136.02 --> 1136.52]  their sin
[1136.52 --> 1137.94]  then slowly
[1137.94 --> 1138.54]  other people
[1138.54 --> 1139.50]  went behind the microphone
[1139.50 --> 1140.44]  and they as pastors
[1140.44 --> 1141.20]  and church leaders
[1141.20 --> 1142.48]  confessed on behalf
[1142.48 --> 1143.34]  of their church
[1143.34 --> 1144.18]  the weakness
[1144.18 --> 1145.06]  the sin
[1145.06 --> 1146.20]  the lack of love
[1146.20 --> 1147.12]  in their congregations
[1147.12 --> 1147.60]  for the city
[1147.60 --> 1149.42]  and it led to a whole evening
[1149.42 --> 1151.30]  and following day
[1151.30 --> 1152.10]  of prayer
[1152.10 --> 1153.40]  confession
[1153.40 --> 1154.58]  and repentance
[1154.58 --> 1156.22]  and Nancy Lee DeMoss
[1156.22 --> 1157.24]  said she's never seen
[1157.24 --> 1158.36]  anything like that
[1158.36 --> 1160.16]  in her entire life
[1160.16 --> 1161.12]  working in the church
[1161.12 --> 1162.86]  and she said also
[1162.86 --> 1163.90]  she's never seen
[1163.90 --> 1164.66]  the spirit move
[1164.66 --> 1165.58]  more powerfully
[1165.58 --> 1166.76]  among people
[1166.76 --> 1167.80]  as they brought
[1167.80 --> 1168.36]  their knees
[1168.36 --> 1168.98]  to the ground
[1168.98 --> 1169.58]  and they said
[1169.58 --> 1170.08]  Lord
[1170.08 --> 1172.52]  have mercy
[1172.52 --> 1174.52]  and God showed up
[1174.52 --> 1175.70]  in power
[1175.70 --> 1177.04]  and in grace
[1177.04 --> 1179.32]  what a practice
[1179.32 --> 1181.72]  what a powerful thing
[1181.72 --> 1182.12]  to do
[1182.12 --> 1182.82]  and I want to ask
[1182.82 --> 1183.26]  the question
[1183.26 --> 1184.38]  could it be
[1184.38 --> 1185.94]  that one of the things
[1185.94 --> 1186.72]  that we have neglected
[1186.72 --> 1187.82]  to our own detriment
[1187.82 --> 1189.06]  in our growth
[1189.06 --> 1189.66]  and our maturity
[1189.66 --> 1190.24]  in Christ
[1190.24 --> 1191.04]  as apprentices
[1191.04 --> 1192.56]  is confession
[1192.56 --> 1195.44]  could it be
[1195.44 --> 1196.20]  that you and I
[1196.20 --> 1197.26]  are still secretly
[1197.26 --> 1198.14]  playing games
[1198.14 --> 1198.66]  with God
[1198.66 --> 1200.62]  where we're trying
[1200.62 --> 1201.10]  to minimize
[1201.10 --> 1202.10]  our sin
[1202.10 --> 1203.54]  act like it's all okay
[1203.54 --> 1204.74]  hide it from our families
[1204.74 --> 1205.76]  hide it from our friends
[1205.76 --> 1207.14]  just kind of power on
[1207.14 --> 1208.04]  in our own strength
[1208.04 --> 1209.14]  only to realize
[1209.14 --> 1210.02]  we're getting nowhere
[1210.02 --> 1212.34]  in our life with Jesus
[1212.34 --> 1213.92]  we're getting nowhere
[1213.92 --> 1214.84]  in our relationships
[1214.84 --> 1216.08]  and what's needed
[1216.08 --> 1217.82]  is as Nancy Lee DeMoss
[1217.82 --> 1218.08]  says
[1218.08 --> 1219.74]  going down
[1219.74 --> 1222.22]  and confessing our sin
[1222.22 --> 1224.22]  and finding grace
[1224.22 --> 1228.42]  as we've already said
[1228.42 --> 1229.22]  the prayer that Jesus
[1229.22 --> 1229.94]  teaches us
[1229.94 --> 1231.62]  is a bold prayer
[1231.62 --> 1233.20]  in fact
[1233.20 --> 1233.68]  when Matthew
[1233.68 --> 1234.66]  uses the word debt
[1234.66 --> 1235.62]  he wants people
[1235.62 --> 1236.28]  to think of
[1236.28 --> 1237.32]  actual debt
[1237.32 --> 1237.88]  we have
[1237.88 --> 1239.44]  the actual things
[1239.44 --> 1240.04]  we owe someone
[1240.04 --> 1240.84]  in the commercial world
[1240.84 --> 1241.28]  the money
[1241.28 --> 1242.60]  and it's as bold
[1242.60 --> 1243.20]  as you and I
[1243.20 --> 1244.06]  going to the person
[1244.06 --> 1245.16]  who holds our huge
[1245.16 --> 1246.12]  Vancouver mortgage
[1246.12 --> 1247.30]  and saying
[1247.30 --> 1249.60]  can you cancel it
[1249.60 --> 1251.24]  does that work
[1251.24 --> 1252.90]  and that's probably
[1252.90 --> 1253.60]  most effective
[1253.60 --> 1254.28]  as an illustration
[1254.28 --> 1255.14]  in the west coast
[1255.14 --> 1256.02]  if I was a pastor
[1256.02 --> 1256.36]  out east
[1256.36 --> 1257.14]  I would not use
[1257.14 --> 1257.76]  that illustration
[1257.76 --> 1259.36]  it's bold
[1259.36 --> 1260.58]  and Jesus
[1260.58 --> 1261.64]  knows our hearts
[1261.64 --> 1262.68]  he knows how oppressed
[1262.68 --> 1263.54]  we are under the weight
[1263.54 --> 1264.26]  and the power of sin
[1264.26 --> 1264.62]  and he knows
[1264.62 --> 1266.34]  that we can't solve it
[1266.34 --> 1267.60]  we are people
[1267.60 --> 1269.06]  who perpetuate sin
[1269.06 --> 1270.00]  we trade one idol
[1270.00 --> 1270.92]  we finally deal with it
[1270.92 --> 1271.94]  we pick up a new idol
[1271.94 --> 1273.56]  we are idol worshippers
[1273.56 --> 1274.94]  sin is powerful
[1274.94 --> 1275.78]  in our lives
[1275.78 --> 1277.66]  and just one small way
[1277.66 --> 1278.74]  I have seen this
[1278.74 --> 1279.42]  at work in the last
[1279.42 --> 1279.82]  couple weeks
[1279.82 --> 1280.52]  I've had conversations
[1280.52 --> 1281.62]  with other young parents
[1281.62 --> 1282.50]  and you know
[1282.50 --> 1283.08]  we as parents
[1283.08 --> 1285.44]  we are very aware
[1285.44 --> 1286.50]  of how we were parented
[1286.50 --> 1287.06]  and then we have
[1287.06 --> 1287.62]  big visions
[1287.62 --> 1288.18]  for how we are going
[1288.18 --> 1288.80]  to parent better
[1288.80 --> 1289.64]  than our parents
[1289.64 --> 1289.90]  right
[1289.90 --> 1291.16]  and we all have
[1291.16 --> 1291.58]  those moments
[1291.58 --> 1291.86]  where we are like
[1291.86 --> 1292.86]  oh I am totally
[1292.86 --> 1293.68]  not going to do this
[1293.68 --> 1294.52]  like my parents did
[1294.52 --> 1295.66]  I will not discipline
[1295.66 --> 1296.74]  the way I was disciplined
[1296.74 --> 1297.88]  and then one of two
[1297.88 --> 1298.50]  things happen
[1298.50 --> 1299.90]  and this is hypothetical
[1299.90 --> 1300.60]  I am not talking
[1300.60 --> 1301.14]  about me here
[1301.14 --> 1302.70]  one of two things happen
[1302.70 --> 1303.44]  number one
[1303.44 --> 1304.54]  you do exactly
[1304.54 --> 1305.72]  what your parents did
[1305.72 --> 1306.58]  or worse
[1306.58 --> 1308.48]  or the opposite extreme
[1308.48 --> 1309.22]  is you will swing
[1309.22 --> 1309.68]  the pendulum
[1309.68 --> 1310.34]  and react
[1310.34 --> 1311.10]  against your parents
[1311.10 --> 1311.54]  and you will do
[1311.54 --> 1312.60]  equally destructive
[1312.60 --> 1313.64]  parenting things
[1313.64 --> 1314.66]  just very different
[1314.66 --> 1315.44]  than your parents
[1315.44 --> 1316.96]  do you see the power
[1316.96 --> 1317.36]  of sin
[1317.36 --> 1318.22]  see the cycle
[1318.22 --> 1319.34]  we react
[1319.34 --> 1320.22]  but we are still
[1320.22 --> 1321.12]  living in sin
[1321.12 --> 1321.94]  and we are not
[1321.94 --> 1322.80]  living in health
[1322.80 --> 1325.90]  Jesus knows this
[1325.90 --> 1328.14]  and he knows
[1328.14 --> 1328.70]  our hearts
[1328.70 --> 1329.60]  he knows
[1329.60 --> 1330.54]  you can't deal
[1330.54 --> 1330.88]  with sin
[1330.88 --> 1331.56]  you can't pay
[1331.56 --> 1331.88]  the debt
[1331.88 --> 1332.94]  you can't carry
[1332.94 --> 1333.50]  its weight
[1333.50 --> 1333.88]  and he says
[1333.88 --> 1334.76]  confess
[1334.76 --> 1337.08]  ask the father
[1337.08 --> 1339.02]  to forgive you
[1339.02 --> 1340.88]  allow him
[1340.88 --> 1341.92]  to deal
[1341.92 --> 1342.94]  with sin
[1342.94 --> 1344.34]  and I think
[1344.34 --> 1344.86]  the practice
[1344.86 --> 1345.50]  of confession
[1345.50 --> 1346.66]  and this part
[1346.66 --> 1347.22]  of the Lord's Prayer
[1347.22 --> 1347.86]  brings us right
[1347.86 --> 1348.48]  to the center
[1348.48 --> 1349.30]  of the Christian faith
[1349.30 --> 1350.78]  right to the center
[1350.78 --> 1351.86]  of God's character
[1351.86 --> 1353.36]  and that is
[1353.36 --> 1354.44]  grace
[1354.44 --> 1356.82]  Richard Foster
[1356.82 --> 1359.00]  says that most people
[1359.00 --> 1360.32]  fail to ask
[1360.32 --> 1361.24]  for forgiveness
[1361.24 --> 1362.22]  and they fail
[1362.22 --> 1362.74]  to practice
[1362.74 --> 1363.28]  confession
[1363.28 --> 1364.36]  because they have
[1364.36 --> 1365.26]  a distorted view
[1365.26 --> 1365.80]  of God
[1365.80 --> 1367.44]  they don't believe
[1367.44 --> 1368.24]  that God is gracious
[1368.24 --> 1369.04]  and compassionate
[1369.04 --> 1369.84]  that he's slow
[1369.84 --> 1370.22]  to anger
[1370.22 --> 1370.92]  he doesn't treat us
[1370.92 --> 1372.06]  as our sins deserve
[1372.06 --> 1373.74]  rather they think
[1373.74 --> 1374.62]  he's vindictive
[1374.62 --> 1376.30]  he's quick to judge
[1376.30 --> 1377.92]  he's perpetually
[1377.92 --> 1378.44]  disappointed
[1378.44 --> 1379.08]  with our lives
[1379.08 --> 1379.82]  and so we prefer
[1379.82 --> 1380.38]  to hide
[1380.38 --> 1381.24]  prefer to leave
[1381.24 --> 1381.68]  the sin
[1381.68 --> 1382.86]  right where it is
[1382.86 --> 1383.88]  and never find
[1383.88 --> 1384.78]  the grace of God
[1384.78 --> 1386.50]  and at the beginning
[1386.50 --> 1387.30]  of his own writing
[1387.30 --> 1388.18]  on grace
[1388.18 --> 1389.00]  on confession
[1389.00 --> 1390.96]  Richard Foster says
[1390.96 --> 1391.78]  at the heart
[1391.78 --> 1392.68]  of God
[1392.68 --> 1394.86]  is the desire
[1394.86 --> 1395.74]  to give
[1395.74 --> 1397.80]  and forgive
[1397.80 --> 1400.92]  and here we again
[1400.92 --> 1402.06]  go back to those words
[1402.06 --> 1403.94]  from 1 John 1 9
[1403.94 --> 1405.40]  if we confess
[1405.40 --> 1406.24]  our sins
[1406.24 --> 1408.10]  he is faithful
[1408.10 --> 1409.44]  and just
[1409.44 --> 1411.14]  and will forgive
[1411.14 --> 1412.04]  our sins
[1412.04 --> 1413.54]  and purify us
[1413.54 --> 1415.56]  from all unrighteousness
[1415.56 --> 1420.14]  in his own teaching
[1420.14 --> 1420.90]  with his apprentices
[1420.90 --> 1422.76]  Jesus doesn't only
[1422.76 --> 1423.76]  teach them to pray
[1423.76 --> 1424.94]  he also tells them
[1424.94 --> 1426.26]  story after story
[1426.26 --> 1427.34]  teaching and parable
[1427.34 --> 1428.08]  about the character
[1428.08 --> 1428.58]  of God
[1428.58 --> 1430.04]  one of my favorites
[1430.04 --> 1431.06]  perhaps one of the favorites
[1431.06 --> 1432.62]  in most of the gospels
[1432.62 --> 1434.40]  is the story
[1434.40 --> 1435.18]  about this son
[1435.18 --> 1436.78]  who goes to his father
[1436.78 --> 1437.34]  and he says
[1437.34 --> 1438.64]  I want to steal your money
[1438.64 --> 1439.88]  I want to bring shame
[1439.88 --> 1440.54]  to the family
[1440.54 --> 1441.12]  I want to bring
[1441.12 --> 1442.24]  disreputation
[1442.24 --> 1443.32]  on your name
[1443.32 --> 1444.04]  and I'm going to
[1444.04 --> 1444.92]  wreck my life
[1444.92 --> 1446.32]  spend your money
[1446.32 --> 1447.52]  and completely
[1447.52 --> 1448.38]  throw it all away
[1448.38 --> 1449.72]  that's the first half
[1449.72 --> 1450.08]  of the story
[1450.08 --> 1450.78]  that Jesus tells
[1450.78 --> 1451.42]  of this son
[1451.42 --> 1452.84]  who dishonors his father
[1452.84 --> 1453.86]  robs him
[1453.86 --> 1454.82]  of his inheritance
[1454.82 --> 1456.22]  and wrecks his life
[1456.22 --> 1457.50]  the second half
[1457.50 --> 1458.04]  of the story
[1458.04 --> 1458.40]  however
[1458.40 --> 1459.76]  is about the father
[1459.76 --> 1461.78]  he describes the father
[1461.78 --> 1463.24]  as a patient father
[1463.24 --> 1464.34]  who's waiting
[1464.34 --> 1465.10]  at the gate
[1465.10 --> 1465.92]  for his son
[1465.92 --> 1468.78]  he describes his father
[1468.78 --> 1471.20]  as a running father
[1471.20 --> 1472.68]  who when he sees
[1472.68 --> 1473.18]  that son
[1473.18 --> 1473.84]  at a distance
[1473.84 --> 1475.20]  he lifts up his cloak
[1475.20 --> 1476.66]  and he runs down
[1476.66 --> 1477.52]  the walkway
[1477.52 --> 1478.36]  to get him
[1478.36 --> 1480.32]  he describes the father
[1480.32 --> 1481.52]  as an embracing father
[1481.52 --> 1483.12]  who throws his arms
[1483.12 --> 1484.20]  around the son
[1484.20 --> 1485.70]  before he even
[1485.70 --> 1486.70]  hears the confession
[1486.70 --> 1488.96]  of the mess he made
[1488.96 --> 1491.00]  and he describes the father
[1491.00 --> 1492.12]  as a feasting
[1492.12 --> 1493.48]  celebrating father
[1493.48 --> 1493.96]  who says
[1493.96 --> 1495.08]  come inside
[1495.08 --> 1495.92]  we're going to kill
[1495.92 --> 1496.62]  the fatted calf
[1496.62 --> 1498.38]  and we are going to party
[1498.38 --> 1500.54]  that you are here
[1500.54 --> 1502.50]  and it's when we understand
[1502.50 --> 1503.70]  that to be
[1503.70 --> 1505.34]  the heart of our father
[1505.34 --> 1506.78]  that we can honestly
[1506.78 --> 1508.16]  truthfully
[1508.16 --> 1509.24]  confess
[1509.24 --> 1510.60]  our sin
[1510.60 --> 1512.06]  our shortcomings
[1512.06 --> 1513.36]  our lack of love
[1513.36 --> 1514.52]  our lack of joy
[1514.52 --> 1515.38]  our addictions
[1515.38 --> 1516.84]  before our father
[1516.84 --> 1517.72]  who loves us
[1517.72 --> 1518.76]  and can deal
[1518.76 --> 1519.48]  with our sin
[1519.48 --> 1522.46]  Jesus doesn't just tell us
[1522.46 --> 1523.16]  about the father
[1523.16 --> 1524.26]  he demonstrates
[1524.26 --> 1525.30]  the very heart
[1525.30 --> 1525.92]  of the father
[1525.92 --> 1527.36]  and when Jesus' hands
[1527.36 --> 1528.30]  are bloodied
[1528.30 --> 1528.68]  beaten
[1528.68 --> 1529.80]  and nailed to the cross
[1529.80 --> 1532.04]  they are the outstretched hands
[1532.04 --> 1533.00]  of God the father
[1533.00 --> 1533.48]  who says
[1533.48 --> 1534.88]  I love my world
[1534.88 --> 1536.46]  love my people
[1536.46 --> 1537.86]  and I love you
[1537.86 --> 1539.30]  too much
[1539.30 --> 1541.44]  to let it wreck your lives
[1541.44 --> 1543.00]  and Jesus
[1543.00 --> 1543.86]  my son
[1543.86 --> 1544.90]  whom I love
[1544.90 --> 1546.70]  will deal with its power
[1546.70 --> 1548.04]  he will defeat
[1548.04 --> 1548.96]  all of it
[1548.96 --> 1550.04]  and bring it to the grave
[1550.04 --> 1551.04]  so that you
[1551.04 --> 1552.18]  can
[1552.18 --> 1553.04]  be
[1553.04 --> 1554.00]  free
[1554.00 --> 1556.66]  the cross
[1556.66 --> 1557.92]  is God's
[1557.92 --> 1559.14]  public declaration
[1559.14 --> 1560.76]  of grace
[1560.76 --> 1562.08]  it's the place
[1562.08 --> 1562.62]  where he says
[1562.62 --> 1563.90]  sin holds
[1563.90 --> 1564.80]  no power
[1564.80 --> 1565.54]  anymore
[1565.54 --> 1567.54]  I have defeated it
[1567.54 --> 1568.56]  for my world
[1568.56 --> 1569.66]  and I have defeated it
[1569.66 --> 1570.52]  for you
[1570.52 --> 1572.38]  receive that
[1572.38 --> 1574.64]  and again I say
[1574.64 --> 1576.62]  very rarely
[1576.62 --> 1577.82]  can you receive it
[1577.82 --> 1580.38]  unless you go to Christ
[1580.38 --> 1581.16]  in prayer
[1581.16 --> 1583.18]  and receive that
[1583.18 --> 1583.94]  through confession
[1583.94 --> 1587.84]  as I've mentioned
[1587.84 --> 1588.82]  that this is not just
[1588.82 --> 1589.60]  the boldest prayer
[1589.60 --> 1590.22]  it's also
[1590.22 --> 1591.16]  the most demanding
[1591.16 --> 1593.10]  and Jesus doesn't just say
[1593.10 --> 1594.06]  forgive us our debts
[1594.06 --> 1594.38]  he says
[1594.38 --> 1595.56]  forgive us our debts
[1595.56 --> 1597.14]  as we also forgive
[1597.14 --> 1598.18]  our debtors
[1598.18 --> 1599.84]  and even at the end
[1599.84 --> 1600.64]  of the Lord's Prayer
[1600.64 --> 1601.84]  Jesus elaborates
[1601.84 --> 1602.62]  this is what I call
[1602.62 --> 1603.58]  a wince passage
[1603.58 --> 1604.30]  he says
[1604.30 --> 1605.86]  for if you forgive others
[1605.86 --> 1607.22]  when they sin against you
[1607.22 --> 1608.02]  your heavenly father
[1608.02 --> 1609.08]  will also forgive you
[1609.08 --> 1610.18]  but if you do not
[1610.18 --> 1611.08]  forgive others
[1611.08 --> 1611.68]  their sin
[1611.68 --> 1613.08]  your father will not
[1613.08 --> 1614.36]  forgive your sins
[1614.36 --> 1616.40]  that's one of those
[1616.40 --> 1617.20]  wince passages
[1617.20 --> 1618.96]  that catches us off guard
[1618.96 --> 1620.36]  church father
[1620.36 --> 1621.24]  John Chrysostom
[1621.24 --> 1622.12]  has famously written
[1622.12 --> 1623.14]  this about this passage
[1623.14 --> 1623.66]  he says
[1623.66 --> 1625.26]  to ask forgiveness
[1625.26 --> 1625.90]  of God
[1625.90 --> 1627.76]  is a great benefit
[1627.76 --> 1629.68]  and then deny
[1629.68 --> 1630.46]  that grace
[1630.46 --> 1631.46]  to others
[1631.46 --> 1632.82]  is to mock
[1632.82 --> 1633.70]  God
[1633.70 --> 1636.00]  and his point
[1636.00 --> 1636.74]  is clear
[1636.74 --> 1638.54]  to turn to the father
[1638.54 --> 1639.76]  to confess before the father
[1639.76 --> 1640.82]  to receive the grace
[1640.82 --> 1641.78]  that comes through Jesus
[1641.78 --> 1643.30]  and then to withhold that
[1643.30 --> 1643.88]  is to say
[1643.88 --> 1645.00]  you don't get grace
[1645.00 --> 1646.46]  right
[1646.46 --> 1647.54]  to receive grace
[1647.54 --> 1649.02]  is to be changed by it
[1649.02 --> 1649.92]  and those of us
[1649.92 --> 1651.00]  who really understand
[1651.00 --> 1651.94]  what it is that God
[1651.94 --> 1652.70]  has done for us
[1652.70 --> 1653.46]  through the cross
[1653.46 --> 1655.02]  gain the strength
[1655.02 --> 1656.12]  by the power of Jesus
[1656.12 --> 1656.94]  in his spirit
[1656.94 --> 1658.18]  to say to those
[1658.18 --> 1658.90]  who have hurt us
[1658.90 --> 1659.68]  and wounded us
[1659.68 --> 1660.84]  and sinned against us
[1660.84 --> 1663.42]  I forgive you
[1663.42 --> 1670.56]  a quote I read this week
[1670.56 --> 1671.50]  that I quite love
[1671.50 --> 1673.18]  says this
[1673.18 --> 1673.96]  we are never
[1673.96 --> 1675.58]  more like Jesus
[1675.58 --> 1677.96]  than when we forgive
[1677.96 --> 1680.60]  you know
[1680.60 --> 1682.06]  you're apprenticing well
[1682.06 --> 1683.92]  when you are
[1683.92 --> 1685.04]  extending grace
[1685.04 --> 1688.30]  the natural outworking
[1688.30 --> 1689.72]  of receiving mercy
[1689.72 --> 1691.92]  is giving mercy
[1691.92 --> 1693.22]  and I want to ask
[1693.22 --> 1693.80]  the question
[1693.80 --> 1695.22]  who are the people
[1695.22 --> 1696.22]  that come to your mind
[1696.22 --> 1698.00]  what relationships
[1698.00 --> 1699.32]  come to the forefront
[1699.32 --> 1700.20]  of your mind
[1700.20 --> 1701.74]  when you think about
[1701.74 --> 1702.70]  extending grace
[1702.70 --> 1705.54]  and I want to encourage you
[1705.54 --> 1706.64]  in the coming days
[1706.64 --> 1707.44]  as you are able
[1707.44 --> 1708.74]  to think about
[1708.74 --> 1710.42]  not only how you might want
[1710.42 --> 1711.76]  to practice confession
[1711.76 --> 1713.82]  before your heavenly father
[1713.82 --> 1715.94]  but also with
[1715.94 --> 1716.94]  your brothers
[1716.94 --> 1717.82]  and your sisters
[1717.82 --> 1719.30]  your family members
[1719.30 --> 1720.42]  and your friends
[1720.42 --> 1722.88]  who are the people
[1722.88 --> 1723.50]  that you might need
[1723.50 --> 1724.52]  to confess sin to
[1724.52 --> 1725.56]  and receive mercy
[1725.56 --> 1727.24]  and conversely
[1727.24 --> 1728.14]  who are those people
[1728.14 --> 1730.02]  that you need to forgive
[1730.02 --> 1732.30]  I'm guessing
[1732.30 --> 1733.56]  there are many grudges
[1733.56 --> 1734.38]  in our church
[1734.38 --> 1736.70]  that need that grace
[1736.70 --> 1739.12]  there are many relationships
[1739.12 --> 1740.72]  in our own community
[1740.72 --> 1742.28]  that need mercy
[1742.28 --> 1747.14]  the natural outworking
[1747.14 --> 1749.28]  of God's forgiveness
[1749.28 --> 1750.04]  through confession
[1750.04 --> 1751.74]  is extending it
[1751.74 --> 1753.48]  and we in the moment
[1753.48 --> 1754.46]  of extending forgiveness
[1754.46 --> 1756.26]  we at that very moment
[1756.26 --> 1758.04]  live in the kingdom of God
[1758.04 --> 1758.88]  that's the moment
[1758.88 --> 1759.72]  where we demonstrate
[1759.72 --> 1761.48]  to all those around us
[1761.48 --> 1763.28]  this is the kingdom of God
[1763.28 --> 1764.28]  extending mercy
[1764.28 --> 1765.58]  passing forth mercy
[1765.58 --> 1766.06]  and then saying
[1766.06 --> 1767.02]  this is where it's found
[1767.02 --> 1767.78]  in and through Jesus
[1767.78 --> 1769.32]  and I believe
[1769.32 --> 1770.90]  that as we as a church
[1770.90 --> 1772.08]  step into the ministry
[1772.08 --> 1772.82]  of grace
[1772.82 --> 1773.78]  and forgiveness
[1773.78 --> 1774.54]  to our enemies
[1774.54 --> 1775.36]  to our friends
[1775.36 --> 1776.06]  and family members
[1776.06 --> 1776.68]  who have hurt us
[1776.68 --> 1777.66]  in one way or another
[1777.66 --> 1780.58]  we confound our culture
[1780.58 --> 1781.98]  with a different way
[1781.98 --> 1782.38]  of being
[1782.38 --> 1783.70]  just think about
[1783.70 --> 1784.92]  with me for a minute
[1784.92 --> 1785.76]  about where our culture
[1785.76 --> 1786.16]  is at
[1786.16 --> 1788.34]  just this last week
[1788.34 --> 1789.50]  I heard words
[1789.50 --> 1790.44]  describing our culture
[1790.44 --> 1791.72]  as a shaming culture
[1791.72 --> 1794.92]  a cancelling culture
[1794.92 --> 1797.88]  a retaliatory culture
[1797.88 --> 1800.94]  and a divided culture
[1800.94 --> 1801.88]  that is to say
[1801.88 --> 1802.80]  we have our camps
[1802.80 --> 1803.72]  that are increasingly
[1803.72 --> 1805.00]  polarized from one another
[1805.00 --> 1805.86]  and there is more
[1805.86 --> 1806.96]  and more and more
[1806.96 --> 1807.80]  hate between them
[1807.80 --> 1809.12]  this is the moment
[1809.12 --> 1810.76]  where we show the world
[1810.76 --> 1811.28]  a different way
[1811.28 --> 1811.88]  of being human
[1811.88 --> 1813.04]  a way that is rooted
[1813.04 --> 1813.62]  in the cross
[1813.62 --> 1814.48]  that defeated the power
[1814.48 --> 1814.86]  of sin
[1814.86 --> 1816.00]  out of which comes
[1816.00 --> 1816.80]  grace
[1816.80 --> 1819.18]  what a beautiful posture
[1819.18 --> 1819.90]  hope could have
[1819.90 --> 1820.70]  in Clayton Heights
[1820.70 --> 1821.72]  as a church
[1821.72 --> 1822.44]  that would be known
[1822.44 --> 1823.90]  for forgiveness
[1823.90 --> 1828.12]  but I'm convinced
[1828.12 --> 1829.44]  that to become
[1829.44 --> 1830.30]  that kind of people
[1830.30 --> 1833.08]  starts on our knees
[1833.08 --> 1835.34]  we do not
[1835.34 --> 1836.16]  in our own strength
[1836.16 --> 1837.36]  or by our own power
[1837.36 --> 1838.16]  have what it takes
[1838.16 --> 1839.00]  to be this community
[1839.00 --> 1839.60]  of grace
[1839.60 --> 1841.10]  it starts with saying
[1841.10 --> 1841.52]  Father
[1841.52 --> 1842.80]  you know us
[1842.80 --> 1844.24]  you know our hearts
[1844.24 --> 1845.50]  you know our sin
[1845.50 --> 1847.86]  forgive us our sins
[1847.86 --> 1850.00]  as we forgive
[1850.00 --> 1851.30]  those who have sinned
[1851.30 --> 1852.02]  against us
[1852.02 --> 1854.12]  I want to finish
[1854.12 --> 1855.14]  by reading again
[1855.14 --> 1856.24]  those words
[1856.24 --> 1857.26]  from 1 John 1
[1857.26 --> 1857.84]  verse 9
[1857.84 --> 1860.04]  if we confess
[1860.04 --> 1860.94]  our sins
[1860.94 --> 1862.60]  he is faithful
[1862.60 --> 1864.12]  he is just
[1864.12 --> 1865.54]  and he will
[1865.54 --> 1866.18]  forgive us
[1866.18 --> 1866.88]  our sins
[1866.88 --> 1869.02]  and purify us
[1869.02 --> 1870.10]  from all
[1870.10 --> 1871.10]  unrighteousness
[1871.10 --> 1873.20]  so that we can go
[1873.20 --> 1874.76]  and be the community
[1874.76 --> 1875.38]  of grace
[1875.38 --> 1876.36]  in a world
[1876.36 --> 1877.08]  that desperately
[1877.08 --> 1877.84]  needs it
[1877.84 --> 1879.38]  let's pray
[1879.38 --> 1884.96]  Father
[1884.96 --> 1885.56]  we thank you
[1885.56 --> 1886.24]  for your word
[1886.24 --> 1887.86]  we thank you
[1887.86 --> 1888.44]  for the gift
[1888.44 --> 1889.28]  of these psalms
[1889.28 --> 1889.86]  of confession
[1889.86 --> 1890.54]  we thank you
[1890.54 --> 1891.18]  for giving us
[1891.18 --> 1892.04]  the Lord's prayer
[1892.04 --> 1894.20]  and Lord
[1894.20 --> 1895.24]  as I finish this sermon
[1895.24 --> 1896.16]  I just pray
[1896.16 --> 1897.88]  that you would teach us
[1897.88 --> 1898.62]  to be a community
[1898.62 --> 1899.22]  of confession
[1899.22 --> 1901.90]  I pray that today
[1901.90 --> 1902.74]  and this week
[1902.74 --> 1904.36]  we would learn
[1904.36 --> 1905.26]  to hand over
[1905.26 --> 1905.76]  the burden
[1905.76 --> 1906.42]  of our sin
[1906.42 --> 1907.84]  and place it
[1907.84 --> 1908.18]  at the foot
[1908.18 --> 1908.72]  of the cross
[1908.72 --> 1910.94]  I pray that we would
[1910.94 --> 1912.06]  learn to be truthful
[1912.06 --> 1913.28]  with you
[1913.28 --> 1915.86]  and in our honest
[1915.86 --> 1916.38]  confession
[1916.38 --> 1917.06]  learn
[1917.06 --> 1918.26]  and experience
[1918.26 --> 1919.68]  your grace
[1919.68 --> 1921.02]  and your mercy
[1921.02 --> 1922.62]  and realize
[1922.62 --> 1923.20]  that the work
[1923.20 --> 1923.78]  is finished
[1923.78 --> 1925.20]  the cross
[1925.20 --> 1925.70]  is empty
[1925.70 --> 1927.26]  as is the tomb
[1927.26 --> 1929.04]  and you intercede
[1929.04 --> 1929.68]  for us
[1929.68 --> 1930.86]  in love
[1930.86 --> 1932.52]  Amen
[1932.52 --> 1936.52]  in just a minute
[1936.52 --> 1936.98]  we're going to
[1936.98 --> 1937.52]  celebrate
[1937.52 --> 1939.08]  the meal
[1939.08 --> 1940.02]  the Lord's Supper
[1940.02 --> 1940.50]  together
[1940.50 --> 1942.14]  but I wanted
[1942.14 --> 1943.06]  to spend some time
[1943.06 --> 1943.74]  before that
[1943.74 --> 1945.54]  confessing our sins
[1945.54 --> 1946.36]  in our homes
[1946.36 --> 1947.94]  you know
[1947.94 --> 1948.70]  one of my favorite
[1948.70 --> 1949.22]  experiences
[1949.22 --> 1950.02]  of the Lord's Supper
[1950.02 --> 1950.80]  was in Brazil
[1950.80 --> 1952.04]  and I was taking
[1952.04 --> 1952.56]  a class
[1952.56 --> 1952.98]  with a number
[1952.98 --> 1953.60]  of church planners
[1953.60 --> 1954.52]  and pastors there
[1954.52 --> 1955.78]  and I've never seen
[1955.78 --> 1956.64]  communion done this way
[1956.64 --> 1957.04]  and I think
[1957.04 --> 1957.76]  us westerners
[1957.76 --> 1958.72]  would take a long time
[1958.72 --> 1959.44]  to get to the place
[1959.44 --> 1960.08]  of being comfortable
[1960.08 --> 1960.60]  with this
[1960.60 --> 1962.04]  but each pastor there
[1962.04 --> 1962.90]  they had a chunk
[1962.90 --> 1963.38]  of bread
[1963.38 --> 1964.58]  like a small loaf
[1964.58 --> 1965.56]  and they would
[1965.56 --> 1966.16]  go to another
[1966.16 --> 1966.58]  pastor
[1966.58 --> 1967.14]  and they'd rip
[1967.14 --> 1967.72]  off a piece
[1967.72 --> 1968.24]  of that bread
[1968.24 --> 1969.22]  and hand it to them
[1969.22 --> 1970.16]  this is pre-COVID
[1970.16 --> 1971.78]  and then they would
[1971.78 --> 1973.20]  both start praying
[1973.20 --> 1974.20]  confessing sins
[1974.20 --> 1974.86]  to each other
[1974.86 --> 1976.06]  speaking words
[1976.06 --> 1976.54]  of grace
[1976.54 --> 1977.22]  over each other
[1977.22 --> 1977.80]  and then they'd
[1977.80 --> 1978.52]  eat that together
[1978.52 --> 1979.50]  then they'd find
[1979.50 --> 1980.28]  someone else in the room
[1980.28 --> 1981.40]  take a piece of bread
[1981.40 --> 1982.06]  give it to them
[1982.06 --> 1982.86]  confess their sin
[1982.86 --> 1983.44]  to that brother
[1983.44 --> 1984.00]  and then they would
[1984.00 --> 1984.56]  pray together
[1984.56 --> 1985.62]  and on and on
[1985.62 --> 1986.30]  and on this would go
[1986.30 --> 1987.34]  for almost an hour
[1987.34 --> 1988.44]  and as I looked
[1988.44 --> 1989.06]  around the room
[1989.06 --> 1990.02]  I saw one of the most
[1990.02 --> 1991.10]  beautiful scenes
[1991.10 --> 1992.50]  of confession
[1992.50 --> 1993.70]  of forgiveness
[1993.70 --> 1994.88]  of prayer
[1994.88 --> 1995.98]  and then receiving
[1995.98 --> 1996.64]  the bread
[1996.64 --> 1998.02]  and the wine together
[1998.02 --> 2000.46]  that is a way
[2000.46 --> 2000.94]  of preparing
[2000.94 --> 2001.54]  for the meal
[2001.54 --> 2003.76]  and I think to myself
[2003.76 --> 2004.96]  well what's to stop us
[2004.96 --> 2006.20]  right now
[2006.20 --> 2006.98]  in our homes
[2006.98 --> 2008.58]  from actually speaking
[2008.58 --> 2009.74]  words of confession
[2009.74 --> 2011.76]  and so I encourage you
[2011.76 --> 2012.66]  as you are comfortable
[2012.66 --> 2013.92]  whether you're by yourself
[2013.92 --> 2014.96]  with your spouse
[2014.96 --> 2015.74]  with a friend
[2015.74 --> 2016.34]  with a roommate
[2016.34 --> 2017.24]  or with your family
[2017.24 --> 2018.88]  to speak words
[2018.88 --> 2019.46]  of confession
[2019.46 --> 2020.58]  as we prepare
[2020.58 --> 2021.24]  for the table
[2021.24 --> 2023.14]  and I will do
[2023.14 --> 2024.50]  an introduction
[2024.50 --> 2024.88]  to this
[2024.88 --> 2026.34]  by reading Psalm 32
[2026.34 --> 2030.92]  this Psalm
[2030.92 --> 2031.92]  just grounds us again
[2031.92 --> 2032.70]  in the joy
[2032.70 --> 2033.42]  of confession
[2033.42 --> 2036.64]  after I read this
[2036.64 --> 2037.34]  the worship team
[2037.34 --> 2037.78]  is just going to
[2037.78 --> 2038.24]  play music
[2038.24 --> 2039.02]  and give us time
[2039.02 --> 2039.60]  to confess
[2039.60 --> 2040.70]  and then I will return
[2040.70 --> 2041.44]  and lead us through
[2041.44 --> 2041.94]  communion
[2041.94 --> 2044.12]  blessed are those
[2044.12 --> 2045.28]  whose transgressions
[2045.28 --> 2046.02]  are forgiven
[2046.02 --> 2047.52]  whose sins
[2047.52 --> 2048.32]  are covered
[2048.32 --> 2049.92]  blessed are those
[2049.92 --> 2050.46]  who sin
[2050.46 --> 2051.04]  the Lord
[2051.04 --> 2051.98]  does not count
[2051.98 --> 2052.80]  against them
[2052.80 --> 2054.16]  and whose spirit
[2054.16 --> 2055.46]  is in no deceit
[2055.46 --> 2057.44]  when I kept silent
[2057.44 --> 2059.70]  my bones wasted away
[2059.70 --> 2061.46]  through my groanings
[2061.46 --> 2062.50]  all day long
[2062.50 --> 2063.50]  for day and night
[2063.50 --> 2064.42]  your hand was heavy
[2064.42 --> 2064.96]  on me
[2064.96 --> 2066.02]  my strength
[2066.02 --> 2066.88]  was sapped
[2066.88 --> 2067.96]  as in the heat
[2067.96 --> 2068.42]  of summer
[2068.42 --> 2070.62]  then I acknowledged
[2070.62 --> 2071.72]  my sin to you
[2071.72 --> 2073.26]  and did not cover up
[2073.26 --> 2073.98]  my iniquity
[2073.98 --> 2074.62]  I said
[2074.62 --> 2075.94]  I will confess
[2075.94 --> 2077.06]  my transgressions
[2077.06 --> 2077.64]  to the Lord
[2077.64 --> 2079.60]  and you forgave
[2079.60 --> 2080.52]  my guilt
[2080.52 --> 2082.26]  my sin
[2082.26 --> 2084.06]  therefore
[2084.06 --> 2086.60]  let all the faithful
[2086.60 --> 2087.48]  pray to you
[2087.48 --> 2089.30]  while you may be found
[2089.30 --> 2091.72]  let's spend some time
[2091.72 --> 2092.26]  in confession
[2092.26 --> 2093.70]  what we mean
[2093.70 --> 2093.72]  again
[2093.72 --> 2096.90]  through my
[2096.90 --> 2097.42]  our
[2097.42 --> 2097.74]  Gospel
[2097.74 --> 2097.96]  by
[2097.96 --> 2098.26]  off
[2098.26 --> 2099.04]  and
[2099.04 --> 2101.06]  Scriptures
[2101.06 --> 2101.14]  send submersive
[2102.92 --> 2103.64]  and
[2103.64 --> 2104.40]  as
[2104.40 --> 2105.58]  if
[2105.58 --> 2105.84]  they
[2105.84 --> 2106.56]  or
[2106.56 --> 2108.00]  the
[2108.00 --> 2109.24]  Garder
[2109.24 --> 2109.58]  ustedes
[2109.58 --> 2110.32]  they
[2110.32 --> 2110.48]  must
[2110.48 --> 2110.84]  send
[2110.84 --> 2110.92]  them
[2111.04 --> 2111.44]  themselves
[2111.44 --> 2112.94]  through
[2112.94 --> 2113.08]  and
[2113.08 --> 2113.86]  said
[2113.86 --> 2114.38]  as
[2114.38 --> 2115.20]  then
[2115.20 --> 2115.92]  I
[2115.92 --> 2116.26]  in
[2116.26 --> 2118.26]  Amen.
[2146.26 --> 2148.26]  Amen.
[2176.26 --> 2178.26]  Amen.
[2206.26 --> 2208.26]  Amen.
[2236.26 --> 2238.26]  Amen.
[2266.26 --> 2267.26]  Amen.
[2283.26 --> 2293.80]  Well, brothers and sisters, we now come to the table, this table of grace, and we receive Christ's body and blood given for us.
[2293.80 --> 2301.72]  Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, he took bread, and after he had broken it, he gave thanks, saying,
[2302.10 --> 2307.12]  This is my body. Do this in remembrance of me.
[2308.08 --> 2313.04]  In the same way, he took the cup, and after he had poured it out, he said to his disciples,
[2313.32 --> 2320.26]  This is my blood poured out for you. Do this in remembrance of me.
[2320.26 --> 2329.96]  When we as the church eat this bread, this ordinary bread, and drink this cup, ordinary juice,
[2330.52 --> 2338.38]  we remember and we believe that Jesus Christ fully paid for our sin.
[2339.18 --> 2340.70]  He defeated its power.
[2340.70 --> 2347.86]  And he's the one who says, When you come to the Father, by the cross you receive grace.
[2349.12 --> 2358.48]  And so, take, eat, remember, and believe that the body of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2358.48 --> 2362.84]  was given for the complete forgiveness of all our sin.
[2362.84 --> 2390.38]  Take, drink, remember, and believe that the blood of Jesus was shed
[2390.38 --> 2393.48]  for the complete forgiveness of all our sin.
[2411.06 --> 2413.10]  In your homes, I invite you to stand with me now.
