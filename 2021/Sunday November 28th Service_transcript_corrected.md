[0.00 → 5.92] Can you hear me?
[6.64 → 11.76] For our youth, aged grade 4 to grade 7, we also have lunch,
[11.92 → 15.10] and you can go upstairs with Jonathan, our intern,
[15.24 → 18.52] and he's going to be covering the same material we do together this morning.
[22.94 → 26.60] Hey, while our children and our youth are going to their various classes,
[26.94 → 28.82] I just want to make a strange little announcement,
[28.82 → 32.92] and that is that yesterday we were having a strategic planning and visioning meeting with our leaders,
[33.22 → 35.22] just visioning for our future, praying for our future,
[35.64 → 37.88] and Pastor Sid was there and his wife Candy was there,
[38.00 → 41.88] and Sid just mentioned nonchalantly to me that it was his 45th wedding anniversary,
[42.26 → 43.74] and I was like, wow, that's a milestone,
[43.98 → 47.46] so I want to take a moment and celebrate Sid the goodness of God's here marriage.
[53.80 → 57.50] And I said to Brittany, if I'm at a strategic visioning meeting,
[57.50 → 59.70] and Brittany's there on our 45th wedding anniversary,
[60.02 → 63.54] I think we might have some conflict, so that just says how selfless you both are,
[63.68 → 66.74] and I want to recognize that you've not just been faithful to our church and ministry,
[66.94 → 69.56] but as a married couple modelling God's goodness in marriage.
[72.88 → 75.34] Well, it's Advent, and one of the things that we do every year,
[75.42 → 76.46] if you've been around Hope for a while,
[76.54 → 79.30] is we like to give money to places where there is need.
[79.54 → 82.02] And for the last number of years, we've done water projects,
[82.10 → 84.10] and this year we are doing two different water projects,
[84.10 → 86.52] and one of the deacons highlighted to me the irony,
[86.68 → 90.32] because this year we're doing one water project to bring water where there isn't,
[90.96 → 94.32] and we are doing another water project to get water out of where it shouldn't be.
[95.14 → 97.42] And so we partnered with Living Water International,
[97.62 → 99.92] and they've identified three communities in Honduras,
[100.06 → 103.60] Southeast Honduras, that do not have adequate access to clean water,
[103.74 → 106.06] and so we're hoping that we can raise enough money
[106.06 → 110.08] to drill three wells in three small communities in Southeast Honduras.
[110.08 → 112.32] There are about 5,000 American each,
[112.70 → 114.48] and the lady who we've been in contact with said,
[114.60 → 115.58] can your church do three?
[115.66 → 117.76] And we're like, of course we can.
[118.36 → 119.64] Challenge accepted, right, Hope?
[120.20 → 121.84] And so you can give to that through our app,
[121.92 → 124.00] and also I know it's a burden on many of our hearts
[124.00 → 128.38] to be present, financially caring for those who are going through the flooding right now.
[128.76 → 131.52] And so that app, both of those things you can give to through our app,
[131.60 → 134.54] and we will direct the funds to the areas where there are designations.
[134.54 → 140.86] Well, it's another Advent season, as you can tell,
[140.94 → 142.14] from this beautiful decoration,
[142.38 → 143.92] and I actually just want to say thank you
[143.92 → 147.20] to all the people who put an incredible amount of work into the video that was done,
[147.26 → 149.98] the decorations, that's Sandy, it's Cocaine, it's Desiree,
[150.22 → 152.88] and it's John Mayhew who did the banners,
[152.96 → 154.46] and I'll come to those banners in just a minute.
[155.02 → 156.98] But it's Advent, and if you're new to the church,
[157.04 → 158.92] if you're new to the church calendar, so to speak,
[159.34 → 161.10] Advent is the season of waiting,
[162.06 → 163.84] of waiting for Christ to come.
[164.78 → 167.46] And for us, living on this side of Jesus' death and resurrection,
[167.64 → 170.74] it's a season of looking back to Jesus' first coming,
[171.30 → 174.04] where He fulfilled God's promise to come and bring renewal,
[174.32 → 177.66] but for us, it's also looking forward to our Advent hope,
[177.72 → 179.96] because our Advent hope is not Jesus coming as a baby,
[180.56 → 182.36] our Advent hope is Jesus coming as a King
[182.36 → 184.30] to renew all things once and for all.
[184.30 → 188.22] And we pray that this season will kindle in us a desire
[188.22 → 191.28] for Jesus to return and to bring full renewal.
[191.28 → 195.78] Our theme for this year is Advent blessing.
[195.94 → 198.56] And yes, we did toy with the word blessing,
[198.68 → 202.90] because in my opinion, the word blessing is cheap today.
[203.14 → 205.14] It's like what you see on cheesy greeting cards
[205.14 → 206.32] that makes you wince a little bit.
[206.64 → 208.14] It's what you say to someone after they sneeze,
[208.22 → 210.02] or what you say when you don't know what else to say.
[210.08 → 212.66] It's kind of a vacuous word, in my opinion today.
[213.10 → 214.40] But that's not true in the Bible.
[214.74 → 218.32] In the Bible, this word blessing is just packed full of meaning.
[218.32 → 221.32] And if you're here, when we started our service,
[221.42 → 223.42] we had a slide that defined the word blessing.
[223.98 → 225.38] And it says blessing on the top,
[225.42 → 227.20] and I like the three statements underneath it.
[227.30 → 231.88] It was the protection and presence in favour of God.
[232.00 → 232.86] That's one definition.
[233.30 → 234.98] The fullness of human life.
[235.04 → 235.88] That's another definition.
[236.44 → 237.72] Or to flourish.
[238.78 → 240.60] And we're going to show over the next number of weeks
[240.60 → 245.42] how God sending Jesus is God restoring blessing
[245.42 → 246.44] to His whole creation.
[246.44 → 249.08] And we're really going to tell the story of the Old Testament
[249.08 → 251.76] through that lens of God bringing blessing.
[251.96 → 255.20] God promising to bring shalom back to His world,
[255.30 → 257.58] the fullness of human life, His presence and protection.
[258.12 → 261.08] So that's where we're going from now until Christmas Eve.
[262.32 → 264.06] But that brings me to talk about these banners.
[264.22 → 265.46] I've already gotten a bunch of questions.
[265.60 → 267.74] Some people from the 9 a.m. service were taking photos of them.
[268.02 → 268.98] They come from John Mayhew.
[269.06 → 269.64] Where are you, John?
[269.70 → 270.22] You're here, right?
[270.38 → 271.36] There you are, right there.
[271.86 → 273.32] He's one of the artists in our church,
[273.32 → 274.68] and he did these digitally.
[274.88 → 277.78] And I just want to explain to you John's creative process here.
[277.88 → 279.06] When we gave him our sermon outline,
[279.14 → 281.32] he started imagining as a good artist.
[281.84 → 284.54] And this is God's arm reaching through here.
[284.60 → 285.54] So the hand of God.
[285.94 → 288.52] And this represents the nativity, Jesus coming into the world,
[288.60 → 292.50] and God reaching through that to bring blessing to His creation.
[292.62 → 295.84] You can see below God's hand is that life springing up from the ground.
[296.74 → 298.24] And I'd encourage you after the service,
[298.28 → 299.26] you can come take a closer look.
[299.32 → 300.06] It's just beautiful.
[300.06 → 302.40] And John, thank you for blessing our church with good art.
[302.86 → 306.04] Art is so necessary for the world and for the church.
[306.16 → 306.94] So thank you.
[308.24 → 308.88] Yeah, we can clap.
[314.28 → 317.38] Well, let's hear God speak by His Word this morning.
[317.52 → 319.20] If you have your Bible digitally or physically,
[319.44 → 321.02] turn with me both to Genesis 1,
[321.10 → 322.62] the very first page of the Bible,
[322.88 → 324.86] or not the page, but the first scripture in the Bible,
[325.12 → 326.56] and then John 1.
[326.56 → 329.10] These two passages are tightly linked together.
[330.06 → 335.40] Genesis 1, verse 1.
[336.84 → 341.98] In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[342.56 → 344.38] Now the earth was formless and empty.
[344.96 → 347.04] Darkness was over the surface of the deep,
[347.30 → 350.06] and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
[350.94 → 352.24] And God said,
[353.34 → 355.78] Let there be light.
[356.66 → 357.90] And there was light.
[357.90 → 360.90] Now turn with me to John 1.
[360.90 → 367.28] In the beginning was the Word,
[367.76 → 369.58] and the Word was with God,
[369.68 → 371.40] and the Word was God.
[371.84 → 373.44] He was with God in the beginning.
[374.50 → 376.88] Through Him, all things were made.
[377.26 → 379.98] Without Him, nothing was made that has been made.
[380.68 → 382.02] In Him was life,
[382.56 → 384.90] and the life was the light of all people.
[384.90 → 387.50] The light shines in the darkness,
[388.00 → 390.60] and the darkness has not overcome it.
[395.38 → 398.44] I want you to imagine yourself in this scenario.
[399.18 → 400.76] Maybe some of you have been in this scenario.
[401.68 → 403.56] But I want you to imagine yourself sitting with a neighbour,
[403.82 → 405.12] or a co-worker, or a friend,
[405.28 → 407.16] who knows very little about Advent,
[407.56 → 408.08] and Jesus,
[408.38 → 409.50] and why it all matters.
[409.50 → 412.12] And they've asked you out for a coffee,
[412.22 → 413.60] so that you, as a follower of Jesus,
[413.70 → 416.56] can just explain who is Jesus.
[416.96 → 418.78] Why does His life matter?
[418.86 → 419.72] What's the significance?
[420.60 → 421.52] Okay, imagine that scene.
[423.04 → 426.52] What would you want to say in that conversation?
[427.30 → 431.18] How would you want to start your introduction to Jesus?
[431.84 → 434.38] What stories, or images, or even cultural content
[434.38 → 436.28] would you want to draw into what you share,
[436.36 → 437.54] so that this person you're with,
[437.56 → 438.46] that you care and love about,
[438.98 → 441.88] understands just how significant Jesus is?
[443.48 → 445.24] One of the interesting things to me
[445.24 → 447.16] about Advent in our season right now,
[447.44 → 448.70] in our culture right now,
[448.82 → 451.60] is that there's all these echoes of Jesus, right?
[451.62 → 452.38] We live in what people,
[452.68 → 454.38] well, I should say scholars describe Canada
[454.38 → 455.84] as sort of post-Christian culture.
[456.02 → 458.50] And so Advent, obviously, is organized around Jesus,
[459.14 → 460.12] but when you go to the mall,
[460.12 → 462.64] you hear songs that will reference the manger and the baby,
[462.84 → 464.84] you'll see decorations and nativity scenes.
[465.12 → 466.42] There are a lot of echoes of Jesus,
[466.52 → 469.38] but there's not a lot of explanation of Jesus.
[470.48 → 472.04] And I think historians in the future
[472.04 → 473.82] might look back on what we call Advent today
[473.82 → 474.92] and say, what was this season?
[474.98 → 479.20] You had, like, Black Friday, pre-Good Friday celebrations.
[479.34 → 480.08] You had Cyber Monday.
[480.22 → 481.08] You have Boxing Day.
[481.28 → 483.38] They might not see Jesus so well
[483.38 → 485.18] in the way we do Advent in the West.
[485.78 → 487.00] It needs explanation.
[487.00 → 492.22] When John puts his quill to scroll,
[493.38 → 494.68] he is introducing Jesus.
[495.76 → 497.70] And he's very deliberately, very carefully,
[497.86 → 499.04] very powerfully saying,
[499.52 → 501.34] I want anyone who reads this account
[501.34 → 506.00] to understand the hugeness of Jesus.
[506.36 → 507.48] And John, who's a good writer,
[507.54 → 508.78] in fact, I think John's a genius,
[509.22 → 510.18] and we're going to do a whole series
[510.18 → 511.56] on the Gospel of John on the new year.
[512.20 → 513.12] John, when he starts,
[513.20 → 514.96] knows that your introduction matters.
[514.96 → 516.50] You know, like, remember when you're in university
[516.50 → 517.34] and you're writing papers?
[517.48 → 518.44] The introduction matters.
[518.56 → 520.10] Your professor judges you just on that.
[520.14 → 520.84] They don't read the rest.
[521.52 → 523.02] How you start matters.
[523.60 → 525.64] So the students in the front were getting nervous here.
[525.88 → 528.42] I hope your professors read the rest of your papers, too.
[530.20 → 532.86] But he knows that what he says at the very beginning
[532.86 → 535.16] will frame how people understand Jesus.
[535.26 → 538.14] And he's pulling in some very powerful images
[538.14 → 539.28] and language to say,
[539.88 → 542.48] this is the hugeness of Jesus.
[542.48 → 544.68] He wants to shatter any sense of Jesus
[544.68 → 545.98] that's quaint or small,
[546.24 → 548.10] any sense that he might just be some local hero
[548.10 → 549.02] that had some significance,
[549.24 → 551.06] just a little group of people in the first century.
[551.28 → 553.96] He wants people to read what he put down here
[553.96 → 557.36] and respond the way the wise men did,
[557.44 → 559.86] and that is to fall to their knees in worship.
[560.66 → 562.28] This is not just some cute baby.
[562.80 → 564.54] This is the Saviour of all.
[565.90 → 567.48] Did you notice how he started?
[568.34 → 569.50] I mean, I made it very obvious
[569.50 → 570.80] by reading Genesis first.
[570.80 → 573.38] First, in the beginning.
[574.14 → 576.12] That's how John starts his gospel account.
[576.22 → 577.42] Just let that sink in for a minute.
[578.04 → 579.48] John could have started this gospel account
[579.48 → 580.70] in so many different ways,
[580.74 → 581.60] talking about Jesus' life.
[581.64 → 584.10] He could have done what the other synoptic gospels did,
[584.32 → 584.74] where they say,
[584.80 → 587.20] hey, here's the context Jesus was born in.
[587.24 → 588.28] This is his genealogy.
[588.58 → 589.72] This is Mary and Joseph.
[589.86 → 591.14] This is Herod, who ruled at the time,
[591.20 → 592.90] sort of paint the cultural context.
[593.78 → 594.60] John doesn't do that.
[595.02 → 596.86] As he is reflecting on what he wants
[596.86 → 597.94] to communicate about Jesus,
[597.94 → 600.48] he says, the only way I can start
[600.48 → 604.54] is by going right back to creation.
[605.90 → 606.96] Think about that.
[607.66 → 609.34] That's where it starts for John.
[609.40 → 611.20] He can't talk about Jesus without saying,
[611.50 → 613.10] I've got to tell you the whole story
[613.10 → 616.12] of all things to make sense
[616.12 → 617.94] of the coming of Jesus Christ.
[618.72 → 620.70] That's a big Jesus he's introducing.
[621.52 → 623.76] In the beginning was the Word,
[623.76 → 626.64] and the Word was with God.
[627.54 → 629.80] The Word was God.
[630.44 → 631.96] He was with God in the beginning.
[632.52 → 634.34] Through him, all things were made.
[634.44 → 636.28] Without him, nothing was made
[636.28 → 638.10] that has been made.
[639.66 → 640.18] Wow.
[641.18 → 643.54] And I can just imagine people reading that
[643.54 → 645.30] who are curious about Jesus saying,
[645.58 → 648.06] this guy is a lunatic.
[649.14 → 652.24] John is claiming that Jesus was there
[652.24 → 653.38] from the beginning.
[654.86 → 655.86] That's crazy.
[657.32 → 658.04] You know, every Advent,
[658.14 → 658.84] I tell this story,
[659.00 → 661.18] but it never stops to be impressive to me.
[662.04 → 664.34] I'm driving somewhere a few years ago now,
[664.54 → 666.68] and Adele asks this perfect question.
[666.78 → 667.48] She says to me,
[667.76 → 668.98] a question only kids ask
[668.98 → 670.14] and don't care if it sounds weird.
[670.22 → 672.12] She says, when was God born?
[673.68 → 674.60] What would you say to that?
[674.98 → 676.06] When was God born?
[676.82 → 678.16] And then before I even said anything,
[678.24 → 680.54] I was preparing my pastor theological answer
[680.54 → 683.66] for my child, my son Levi turns to Adele
[683.66 → 685.70] and he says, Adele, God wasn't born.
[686.72 → 687.56] I was like, that's right.
[687.72 → 688.62] God wasn't born.
[689.48 → 691.52] And then Adele says, and I kid you not,
[691.58 → 692.92] this is exactly how she said it.
[692.94 → 694.58] She says, well, Jesus is God
[694.58 → 695.84] and Jesus was born.
[697.44 → 697.80] Right?
[698.44 → 699.96] I was like, look at you two.
[700.06 → 700.78] You're amazing.
[701.02 → 701.98] You're both right.
[702.48 → 705.06] But Adele is like grasping after this reality
[705.06 → 706.26] that Jesus was born.
[706.36 → 708.04] There's a time in history where he sat,
[708.16 → 709.08] laid in this manger,
[709.08 → 710.28] and he did cry, by the way.
[711.24 → 712.46] And yet, John is saying,
[712.62 → 714.34] this Jesus didn't come into existence then.
[714.38 → 716.90] He was the eternal word from the beginning.
[717.80 → 718.48] That's what he's saying.
[718.52 → 720.88] And all things were created through him.
[721.90 → 723.44] That should blow your minds.
[724.56 → 725.82] You know, and John's not the first one
[725.82 → 728.06] to make this audacious claim about Jesus
[728.06 → 729.26] being the eternal word,
[729.34 → 730.10] there from the beginning.
[730.50 → 732.44] Listen to what Paul says in Colossians 1,
[733.12 → 734.88] one of my favourite passages in the Bible.
[735.38 → 736.34] This is how Paul puts it.
[736.34 → 737.18] It says,
[737.32 → 739.88] the Son is the image of the invisible God,
[739.94 → 742.52] the firstborn over all creation.
[743.54 → 745.32] For in him all things were created,
[745.46 → 746.70] things in heaven and on earth,
[746.86 → 747.86] visible and invisible,
[748.06 → 750.72] whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities.
[751.06 → 751.76] Listen to this.
[752.14 → 754.20] All things have been created through him
[754.20 → 757.08] and for him.
[758.76 → 760.48] Paul's basically echoing John.
[760.56 → 762.58] He says, that's Jesus.
[763.42 → 764.54] There from the beginning,
[764.54 → 766.84] the whole world came into existence through him
[766.84 → 768.86] and it's all for him.
[769.58 → 771.18] If I could preach a second sermon this morning,
[771.32 → 772.02] which I will not do,
[772.08 → 773.00] I won't punish you with that,
[773.26 → 775.04] I would talk about how this whole creation
[775.04 → 777.50] is to bring glory to Jesus.
[778.14 → 779.36] That was the intention from the beginning,
[779.46 → 781.72] that all creation would sing his praises
[781.72 → 783.60] and live in dynamic relationship
[783.60 → 786.72] with the Son and the Father and the Spirit.
[787.62 → 788.88] But that's the picture of Jesus.
[789.06 → 790.68] And every year, I have this every year,
[790.74 → 791.78] I bet some of you do too.
[792.40 → 793.14] You're driving around,
[793.14 → 794.18] you see the decorations,
[794.34 → 794.84] you're in the mall,
[794.96 → 795.58] you hear the music,
[795.82 → 796.62] and you think to yourself,
[797.04 → 798.62] we don't have a clue
[798.62 → 799.82] what this season is about.
[800.48 → 802.60] Like, we are just missing the mark.
[802.70 → 804.58] We have monetized and commodified
[804.58 → 805.50] and reduced Jesus
[805.50 → 806.84] to this sort of cute decoration.
[807.00 → 808.14] We have no idea
[808.14 → 810.44] what John's talking about here.
[810.50 → 811.54] And I'm not just talking culturally,
[811.62 → 811.90] by the way.
[812.04 → 813.98] I often worry that we as believers
[813.98 → 816.60] don't have eyes to see the hugeness
[816.60 → 818.30] of what the incarnation of Jesus
[818.30 → 819.14] is all about.
[819.14 → 826.44] John is deliberate
[826.44 → 828.78] in connecting Genesis 1
[828.78 → 830.40] to his telling of the story.
[830.46 → 831.62] In fact, there are so many echoes.
[831.78 → 832.46] I mean, he's talking about
[832.46 → 834.54] in the beginning was the Word,
[834.64 → 835.22] and then he talks about
[835.22 → 836.64] the light shining in the darkness,
[836.76 → 838.16] the light pushing back the darkness,
[838.24 → 839.08] and the whole time he's saying,
[839.34 → 841.98] do you see how you can't understand Jesus
[841.98 → 844.24] without understanding creation?
[844.92 → 846.42] And it's more than just that.
[846.42 → 847.26] I want us to understand
[847.26 → 848.88] just how foundational this is
[848.88 → 849.62] for the Christian life.
[849.68 → 850.80] And I'm going to be belabouring
[850.80 → 851.60] a point this morning,
[851.94 → 853.14] and I hope you're okay with that.
[853.22 → 854.48] I'm going to make some pretty simple points
[854.48 → 856.10] over and over and over again
[856.10 → 858.50] that creation matters
[858.50 → 859.46] if we are to understand
[859.46 → 860.40] why Jesus came.
[861.62 → 862.80] And it's not just a checklist
[862.80 → 863.44] of John saying,
[863.56 → 865.06] hey, let me tell you about creation.
[865.16 → 865.68] And by the way,
[865.80 → 867.98] God was there and Jesus was there.
[868.06 → 868.44] There we go.
[868.50 → 869.62] You have your doctrine set
[869.62 → 870.64] on Jesus being there
[870.64 → 871.16] from the beginning.
[871.48 → 872.82] What John is saying is
[872.82 → 874.92] the story that begins
[874.92 → 876.08] with a good creation
[876.08 → 878.76] is the story that makes sense
[878.76 → 879.76] of why Jesus came.
[880.64 → 881.66] The story that begins
[881.66 → 882.34] with a good creation
[882.34 → 883.32] is the story that makes sense
[883.32 → 884.36] of why Jesus came.
[884.64 → 885.80] There are many stories
[885.80 → 886.82] that make sense of Jesus
[886.82 → 888.16] in a variety of ways.
[888.62 → 889.44] The Roman story
[889.44 → 890.30] in the first century was,
[890.40 → 891.10] well, here's a guy.
[891.56 → 892.78] He was born in Bethlehem,
[893.18 → 894.14] sort of raised up
[894.14 → 895.08] some people around him,
[895.12 → 896.02] had some crazy teaching
[896.02 → 896.92] about the kingdom of God,
[896.98 → 897.86] was a bit rebellious.
[898.20 → 899.36] Then he got himself in trouble
[899.36 → 900.36] with some powerful people,
[900.36 → 901.44] and we crucified him,
[901.54 → 902.56] and that is the end.
[903.18 → 904.62] That's the Roman frame for Jesus.
[904.62 → 905.94] And John's saying,
[906.34 → 907.62] the only way you can understand
[907.62 → 908.68] the fullness of Jesus,
[908.86 → 909.40] who he is,
[909.68 → 910.38] why he came,
[911.44 → 912.68] is starting with the goodness
[912.68 → 913.44] of creation.
[914.70 → 915.68] John's pulling in
[915.68 → 916.98] the whole creation story
[916.98 → 918.34] to help us understand.
[918.88 → 920.58] He wants us to read Genesis 1
[920.58 → 921.80] and understand Genesis 1,
[921.94 → 922.68] and then understand
[922.68 → 923.50] why it matters
[923.50 → 924.40] that Jesus came
[924.40 → 925.56] into that story.
[926.60 → 928.28] Because the story starts
[928.28 → 929.88] with a good God,
[930.00 → 931.24] Father, Son, and Spirit,
[931.24 → 933.62] creating a stunning world
[933.62 → 935.82] and placing humans in it
[935.82 → 938.50] to flourish in his blessing.
[939.34 → 940.50] That's how the story starts.
[941.90 → 943.04] This might sound cheesy to you,
[943.14 → 944.12] but if I had to pick
[944.12 → 945.68] a soundtrack for Genesis 1,
[946.40 → 946.88] have you ever thought
[946.88 → 947.14] about this?
[947.22 → 947.94] If you had to pick
[947.94 → 949.04] a soundtrack for Genesis 1,
[949.10 → 949.64] what would you pick?
[951.10 → 952.10] The one I would pick
[952.10 → 953.38] is Diamonds Are Forever.
[953.50 → 954.42] Does anyone know that piece?
[954.46 → 955.04] It's a classical,
[955.16 → 955.92] it's an orchestra piece.
[956.38 → 957.02] I know it,
[957.22 → 957.94] but I think the first time
[957.94 → 958.32] I ever heard it
[958.32 → 958.90] was at my brother
[958.90 → 959.82] and sister-in-law's wedding,
[960.42 → 961.44] and they played it
[961.44 → 962.08] because Ben and Milena,
[962.20 → 962.74] he's the cellist,
[962.80 → 963.36] she plays violin.
[963.48 → 963.82] They played it
[963.82 → 964.38] at their own wedding,
[964.42 → 965.02] and it's beautiful.
[965.58 → 966.38] But it's a song
[966.38 → 967.36] that starts with just,
[967.44 → 968.20] I think, a bassoon,
[968.34 → 969.08] just kind of repeating.
[969.40 → 970.24] Listen to it when you get home,
[970.28 → 970.78] not right now.
[971.80 → 972.14] The bassoon,
[972.22 → 973.32] and then they add strings
[973.32 → 974.24] and they add more instruments.
[974.34 → 974.64] You start,
[974.74 → 976.00] the orchestra gets pulled in,
[976.04 → 976.72] it gets louder,
[976.88 → 977.62] it plays faster,
[977.70 → 977.96] and then there's
[977.96 → 979.88] this incredible crescendo.
[980.78 → 981.94] That's Genesis 1 to me.
[982.84 → 984.08] It starts with God speaking
[984.08 → 985.54] and light comes into the darkness,
[985.64 → 986.66] and God starts separating
[986.66 → 987.54] and bringing shape
[987.54 → 988.08] to this world,
[988.08 → 989.30] bringing life into it,
[989.36 → 990.44] bringing day and night
[990.44 → 991.34] and colour and beauty
[991.34 → 992.26] and animals and plants.
[992.42 → 993.10] It's getting more
[993.10 → 993.78] and more beautiful.
[993.90 → 994.72] It's starting to build
[994.72 → 995.64] and build and build,
[995.86 → 996.62] and the crescendo
[996.62 → 997.52] of Genesis 1
[997.52 → 998.90] is what?
[1000.48 → 1000.96] Humanity.
[1002.26 → 1003.36] God placing
[1003.36 → 1005.40] these image bearers
[1005.40 → 1006.00] of His
[1006.00 → 1007.24] in this stunning,
[1007.46 → 1007.86] beautiful,
[1008.12 → 1008.60] colourful,
[1008.96 → 1009.56] living,
[1009.88 → 1011.24] packed full of potential world,
[1011.42 → 1012.36] and the first thing
[1012.36 → 1012.82] we read
[1012.82 → 1013.56] after the creation
[1013.56 → 1014.56] of man and woman,
[1014.66 → 1015.16] Adam and Eve,
[1015.16 → 1015.56] is what?
[1016.46 → 1018.60] God blesses them.
[1019.16 → 1019.32] I mean,
[1019.36 → 1019.98] you want to get a sense
[1019.98 → 1020.90] of the character of God
[1020.90 → 1021.54] after making
[1021.54 → 1022.14] this stunning,
[1022.38 → 1022.80] good,
[1022.94 → 1023.54] orderly world.
[1023.76 → 1024.92] He places Adam and Eve
[1024.92 → 1025.50] in that world,
[1025.64 → 1026.16] and He says,
[1026.44 → 1028.04] I bless you
[1028.04 → 1028.90] in this world.
[1029.50 → 1030.50] You have my favour
[1030.50 → 1031.24] and my protection.
[1031.38 → 1032.08] You have a relationship
[1032.08 → 1032.50] with me.
[1032.84 → 1033.90] Enjoy this world.
[1034.04 → 1034.90] Develop this world.
[1035.30 → 1036.24] Cultivate this world.
[1037.14 → 1038.58] Experience all this world.
[1038.58 → 1039.50] has to give,
[1039.70 → 1040.52] rule over it
[1040.52 → 1042.14] as my servant leaders.
[1043.40 → 1044.16] That's the goodness
[1044.16 → 1045.36] of the creation story.
[1048.84 → 1050.10] And I want to say again,
[1051.24 → 1052.40] we don't understand
[1052.40 → 1053.46] why Jesus came
[1053.46 → 1055.04] until we start
[1055.04 → 1055.64] with the goodness
[1055.64 → 1056.38] of creation.
[1057.10 → 1058.02] Sometimes when we tell
[1058.02 → 1059.10] the story of why Jesus came,
[1059.20 → 1059.94] we start with,
[1060.44 → 1061.10] this world is a mess.
[1061.16 → 1061.54] It's broken.
[1061.88 → 1062.50] Which is true.
[1062.58 → 1063.06] We're going to get there
[1063.06 → 1063.52] next week.
[1063.54 → 1064.22] It's going to be great.
[1065.06 → 1065.88] But it starts
[1065.88 → 1066.32] with the goodness
[1066.32 → 1066.96] of creation.
[1066.96 → 1069.06] We do not understand
[1069.06 → 1069.92] why Jesus came
[1069.92 → 1070.78] until we start
[1070.78 → 1071.86] with this good world
[1071.86 → 1073.22] that God brought
[1073.22 → 1073.80] into existence
[1073.80 → 1074.48] through the word
[1074.48 → 1075.08] that is Jesus
[1075.08 → 1076.66] to bring Him glory
[1076.66 → 1077.68] in all of its goodness,
[1077.90 → 1078.62] beauty, variety.
[1080.08 → 1080.90] Now three years ago,
[1080.96 → 1081.46] if you're around,
[1081.84 → 1082.80] you'll know that I had
[1082.80 → 1083.94] this like Dietrich Bonhoeffer
[1083.94 → 1084.68] thing where I was reading
[1084.68 → 1085.52] a ton of his work.
[1085.62 → 1086.24] I was quoting him
[1086.24 → 1087.18] endlessly in my sermons
[1087.18 → 1087.90] until one person
[1087.90 → 1088.28] actually said,
[1088.36 → 1088.82] Dave, you've got to
[1088.82 → 1090.32] tone down your Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
[1090.62 → 1091.06] You're quoting him
[1091.06 → 1091.70] a little too much.
[1092.20 → 1093.02] But I do commend him
[1093.02 → 1093.24] to you.
[1093.28 → 1093.96] He's a great writer.
[1094.74 → 1095.26] And I remember
[1095.26 → 1095.86] three years ago
[1095.86 → 1096.40] when I was on my
[1096.40 → 1097.44] Dietrich Bonhoeffer binge
[1097.44 → 1098.62] that he read some
[1098.62 → 1100.96] really, really powerful stuff
[1100.96 → 1102.10] that he had written
[1102.10 → 1102.72] on the goodness
[1102.72 → 1103.54] of creation.
[1104.24 → 1105.30] And I took a lot of notes
[1105.30 → 1105.80] along the way
[1105.80 → 1106.50] because I remember saying,
[1106.62 → 1107.34] I want to quote this.
[1107.40 → 1108.30] So I'm going to quote him
[1108.30 → 1108.96] again this morning.
[1110.30 → 1111.04] Dietrich wrote some
[1111.04 → 1112.16] amazing stuff
[1112.16 → 1113.00] on marriage.
[1114.08 → 1114.92] And he wrote a lot
[1114.92 → 1115.68] about his own marriage
[1115.68 → 1117.08] and he also officiated weddings
[1117.08 → 1117.82] where he would write out
[1117.82 → 1118.46] different reflections
[1118.46 → 1118.92] on marriage.
[1119.00 → 1119.56] And this is something
[1119.56 → 1120.62] he said at a wedding.
[1120.72 → 1121.94] I'm like, oh, this is good.
[1122.14 → 1122.98] So I'll read it for you
[1122.98 → 1123.74] and then I'll explain
[1123.74 → 1124.66] why it's so significant.
[1124.66 → 1125.66] He writes,
[1126.32 → 1128.12] the desire for earthly bliss
[1128.12 → 1129.14] between husband and wife,
[1129.20 → 1129.96] and you know what we mean,
[1130.08 → 1130.90] earthly bliss.
[1131.10 → 1131.36] Mm-hmm.
[1131.56 → 1131.86] Mm-hmm.
[1132.80 → 1133.92] He said it's not something
[1133.92 → 1135.42] we steal from behind
[1135.42 → 1136.48] God's back.
[1137.12 → 1138.76] It's something he desired
[1138.76 → 1140.48] that we should desire.
[1141.66 → 1143.10] I love that quote.
[1143.94 → 1144.70] And what he's saying
[1144.70 → 1145.48] is that intimacy,
[1145.66 → 1146.06] that bond,
[1146.14 → 1147.34] that sexual experience
[1147.34 → 1147.94] that men and women
[1147.94 → 1148.64] have in marriage,
[1148.78 → 1149.72] that's not something
[1149.72 → 1151.08] that God's surprised by.
[1152.04 → 1153.58] That's something God designed.
[1154.66 → 1155.90] You don't experience joy
[1155.90 → 1156.48] in this world
[1156.48 → 1157.82] that God didn't give
[1157.82 → 1159.14] as a gift for you
[1159.14 → 1160.70] to explore and experience
[1160.70 → 1161.20] and enjoy.
[1162.06 → 1162.94] And I want to say that
[1162.94 → 1164.60] in the widest possible sense
[1164.60 → 1165.62] of every dimension
[1165.62 → 1166.56] of our human life
[1166.56 → 1167.24] in this world,
[1167.58 → 1169.06] nothing surprises God.
[1170.54 → 1171.30] When you're sitting
[1171.30 → 1171.94] with your friends
[1171.94 → 1172.94] in the living room
[1172.94 → 1174.44] and one of your friends
[1174.44 → 1175.22] tells this story
[1175.22 → 1176.74] that is just absolutely hilarious,
[1176.86 → 1177.58] and you know when that happens,
[1177.64 → 1178.46] you've got that one friend
[1178.46 → 1179.36] who laughs too quickly,
[1179.36 → 1180.94] and then they can't stop laughing,
[1181.10 → 1181.70] and then the other friend
[1181.70 → 1182.22] starts laughing,
[1182.30 → 1183.10] and their stomach is hurting.
[1183.36 → 1184.04] Someone's getting mad
[1184.04 → 1184.88] because they're all feeling sick.
[1184.96 → 1185.80] Someone's bawling,
[1185.90 → 1186.88] the snot coming down,
[1187.02 → 1188.52] and it's just this amazing scene.
[1188.78 → 1190.30] Do you think that surprises God?
[1190.56 → 1191.48] The gift of humour
[1191.48 → 1192.54] and friendship
[1192.54 → 1193.52] and relationship
[1193.52 → 1195.86] and just enjoying laughter?
[1196.78 → 1197.66] He desired
[1197.66 → 1199.00] that we should desire that.
[1200.22 → 1201.14] Or perhaps,
[1201.84 → 1202.72] you're a young parent,
[1203.20 → 1204.54] and you're laying on the floor,
[1204.66 → 1205.48] and you've got this toddler
[1205.48 → 1206.92] who's learning how to walk
[1206.92 → 1207.60] and how to talk,
[1207.64 → 1208.58] and you're just working with them,
[1208.58 → 1210.00] and this toddler says,
[1210.24 → 1210.82] your name.
[1212.32 → 1213.78] And it blows your mind.
[1213.88 → 1215.28] It fills your heart with joy,
[1215.34 → 1216.42] not only because the toddler
[1216.42 → 1217.04] said your name
[1217.04 → 1218.10] before your spouse's name,
[1218.14 → 1218.98] but your name.
[1219.12 → 1219.70] They said it.
[1219.90 → 1221.12] They learned how to speak,
[1221.32 → 1222.56] and you just marvelled
[1222.56 → 1223.52] at this little being
[1223.52 → 1224.98] who's now upright and speaking.
[1225.92 → 1226.92] God desired
[1226.92 → 1228.08] that we should desire
[1228.08 → 1231.98] and be filled with joy at that.
[1232.94 → 1233.38] Or,
[1234.32 → 1235.46] imagine yourself walking
[1235.46 → 1236.14] at Crescent Beach,
[1236.18 → 1236.88] and you see this thing.
[1236.88 → 1237.52] I've heard them.
[1237.60 → 1238.38] I've heard people speak
[1238.38 → 1239.94] of these things called sunsets.
[1240.70 → 1241.82] I've been here 13 years.
[1241.94 → 1243.12] I'm still waiting to experience
[1243.12 → 1243.78] these things they're called
[1243.78 → 1244.72] sunsets in B.C.
[1245.60 → 1247.04] But you're walking Crescent Beach,
[1247.08 → 1247.96] and you see this sunset,
[1248.20 → 1248.68] and everyone,
[1248.78 → 1249.96] it doesn't matter what they believe,
[1250.04 → 1250.76] it doesn't matter who they are,
[1250.80 → 1252.12] they turn, and they behold,
[1252.54 → 1253.26] or if they're a millennial,
[1253.32 → 1254.42] they just take endless photos
[1254.42 → 1255.40] of this sunset.
[1257.02 → 1258.54] God desires that we should
[1258.54 → 1259.24] take that in
[1259.24 → 1260.08] and marvel
[1260.08 → 1261.48] at His beauty
[1261.48 → 1262.16] and His goodness.
[1262.16 → 1264.02] He gives that as a gift
[1264.02 → 1265.42] in His creation.
[1267.46 → 1268.48] Or the satisfaction
[1268.48 → 1269.60] of your work
[1269.60 → 1271.14] with a job well done.
[1271.60 → 1272.32] Or the gift
[1272.32 → 1273.46] of building friendship.
[1274.76 → 1275.88] All of these things
[1275.88 → 1276.64] He desires
[1276.64 → 1277.76] that we should enjoy.
[1278.08 → 1278.82] My favourite, perhaps.
[1278.94 → 1279.56] Not my favourite.
[1280.24 → 1281.46] But one of my favourites is
[1281.46 → 1282.46] that feeling
[1282.46 → 1283.42] of sinking your teeth
[1283.42 → 1285.24] into a perfectly cooked steak.
[1287.06 → 1287.42] Mm-hmm.
[1288.22 → 1288.70] Mm-hmm.
[1288.70 → 1290.34] The vegetarians are like,
[1290.36 → 1291.14] are you sure that's part
[1291.14 → 1291.80] of the good creation?
[1292.52 → 1293.56] Oh, yes it is.
[1295.52 → 1296.66] God desires
[1296.66 → 1297.80] that we should enjoy
[1297.80 → 1298.30] these things,
[1298.36 → 1299.58] and He's not surprised by them.
[1299.64 → 1300.26] He is a Father
[1300.26 → 1301.92] who blesses His creation,
[1302.38 → 1303.62] who wants us to live
[1303.62 → 1304.76] a flourishing,
[1304.94 → 1305.54] good life
[1305.54 → 1306.36] in this creation.
[1307.44 → 1308.18] And I sometimes think
[1308.18 → 1308.56] as Christians,
[1308.70 → 1309.24] we miss that.
[1309.30 → 1309.96] I'm struck by how
[1309.96 → 1311.46] some of the ancient writers
[1311.46 → 1313.36] say that the incarnation itself,
[1313.46 → 1314.48] Jesus taking on flesh,
[1314.54 → 1317.04] is God's yes to flesh.
[1317.80 → 1319.66] His yes to the physical body.
[1319.76 → 1319.96] In fact,
[1320.00 → 1321.22] one of the great things
[1321.22 → 1322.52] that Christians around the world
[1322.52 → 1324.18] declare as a united statement
[1324.18 → 1324.86] of faith is,
[1325.10 → 1326.44] we believe in the resurrection
[1326.44 → 1327.38] of the body.
[1328.32 → 1328.88] Think about that.
[1328.92 → 1329.68] The ultimate aim
[1329.68 → 1330.58] is not just that we go
[1330.58 → 1331.24] to be with Jesus
[1331.24 → 1331.72] when we die.
[1331.80 → 1333.30] It's that when we die,
[1333.42 → 1334.18] Jesus comes back,
[1334.24 → 1335.44] we will get new bodies
[1335.44 → 1337.66] to live in a new creation forever.
[1338.50 → 1339.32] That's powerful.
[1341.88 → 1343.04] Jesus has come
[1343.04 → 1345.80] to restore the blessing
[1345.80 → 1347.52] that God has placed
[1347.52 → 1348.48] over His whole creation.
[1348.60 → 1349.00] He's come,
[1349.14 → 1349.76] as you might put it,
[1349.96 → 1351.08] to peel back
[1351.08 → 1352.60] the cancerous effects of sin
[1352.60 → 1354.86] so that we would experience again
[1354.86 → 1355.96] the way God intended
[1355.96 → 1357.12] this world to be lived in.
[1357.78 → 1358.64] That's what Jesus
[1358.64 → 1359.58] is coming to do.
[1360.48 → 1361.42] Or as one of my
[1361.42 → 1362.36] the smartest professors
[1362.36 → 1362.98] I ever had,
[1363.04 → 1363.84] he put it so simply.
[1363.92 → 1364.14] He said,
[1364.22 → 1365.16] God doesn't create junk.
[1366.28 → 1367.38] God doesn't create junk
[1367.38 → 1368.62] and God doesn't junk
[1368.62 → 1369.92] what He creates.
[1370.36 → 1371.02] What He does
[1371.02 → 1371.70] is from the beginning
[1371.70 → 1372.98] promise to bring salvation,
[1373.18 → 1374.12] promise to bring renewal,
[1374.12 → 1375.64] and He sets out on that road
[1375.64 → 1376.42] and He sends Jesus
[1376.42 → 1378.44] to do that very thing,
[1378.96 → 1380.06] to deal with the sin
[1380.06 → 1380.88] that destroys
[1380.88 → 1381.76] and dehumanizes
[1381.76 → 1382.68] and pulls us away
[1382.68 → 1383.96] from the flourishing life
[1383.96 → 1385.02] we were designed for
[1385.02 → 1385.98] from the beginning.
[1388.06 → 1388.86] Now one of the ways
[1388.86 → 1389.92] I want to illustrate this point,
[1389.98 → 1390.98] I have lots of different options
[1390.98 → 1392.40] but my sermon will be too long.
[1392.48 → 1392.88] One of the ways
[1392.88 → 1393.96] I want to illustrate this point
[1393.96 → 1395.28] from Jesus' own life
[1395.28 → 1396.54] is His miracles.
[1397.18 → 1398.28] I've talked about this before
[1398.28 → 1399.36] and every time I do this
[1399.36 → 1400.14] I get someone who comes up
[1400.14 → 1400.78] after the service saying,
[1401.00 → 1401.46] oh wow,
[1401.76 → 1402.88] that just totally reshapes
[1402.88 → 1404.08] the way I see Jesus' miracles.
[1405.08 → 1406.96] Jesus' miracles are not just
[1406.96 → 1408.34] a demonstration of power
[1408.34 → 1409.90] although that is true.
[1410.46 → 1411.68] It is not just that He's showing
[1411.68 → 1412.90] how much He can do,
[1413.00 → 1413.96] how much healing He can do,
[1414.00 → 1415.24] how much power He can possess
[1415.24 → 1416.34] although it's true.
[1417.28 → 1418.30] It's not just like,
[1418.46 → 1420.36] hey, look at this ability I have.
[1420.90 → 1421.90] What Jesus is doing
[1421.90 → 1422.72] in all of His miracles
[1422.72 → 1423.84] is showing the way
[1423.84 → 1425.54] the world is supposed to be
[1425.54 → 1428.58] and the way the world will be.
[1429.26 → 1430.88] He's giving us sort of snapshots
[1430.88 → 1432.00] to the way we are created
[1432.00 → 1433.22] and snapshots to the way
[1433.22 → 1433.90] the world will be
[1433.90 → 1434.78] when He returns.
[1435.20 → 1436.44] Let me give you some examples.
[1437.46 → 1438.88] When Jesus goes
[1438.88 → 1440.16] and heals a leper,
[1441.14 → 1442.30] that leper has got disease
[1442.30 → 1442.92] on their skin,
[1443.02 → 1443.86] they're banished from community
[1443.86 → 1444.76] because it's so contagious.
[1445.26 → 1446.84] Jesus goes, and He touches the leper
[1446.84 → 1447.56] and He says,
[1447.66 → 1448.14] be healed.
[1448.80 → 1449.76] And the leper's skin
[1449.76 → 1450.60] is made clean.
[1451.88 → 1452.64] And it's not just
[1452.64 → 1453.60] a demonstration of power,
[1453.72 → 1454.70] it's Jesus' way of saying,
[1455.08 → 1456.32] you were created
[1456.32 → 1457.96] for health.
[1457.96 → 1460.40] You were created
[1460.40 → 1461.16] to have a body
[1461.16 → 1463.02] that is whole and healthy.
[1463.72 → 1464.98] And when I come back
[1464.98 → 1466.36] and restore all things,
[1466.80 → 1468.80] you will know health.
[1470.80 → 1471.24] Or,
[1471.78 → 1472.68] Jesus in the boat
[1472.68 → 1473.42] with His disciples.
[1474.16 → 1475.14] Storm comes up
[1475.14 → 1475.66] and it's knocking
[1475.66 → 1476.22] against the boat.
[1476.32 → 1477.00] The disciples are worried
[1477.00 → 1477.68] they're all going to die
[1477.68 → 1478.16] in the storm
[1478.16 → 1479.78] and Jesus extends His hand
[1479.78 → 1480.76] over the water.
[1481.02 → 1481.34] He says,
[1481.44 → 1481.94] be still
[1481.94 → 1483.56] and the water is a pancake.
[1484.86 → 1486.12] And Jesus is showing
[1486.12 → 1486.86] at that moment
[1486.86 → 1488.48] this world was created
[1488.48 → 1489.46] for harmony.
[1490.98 → 1491.86] Not tsunamis,
[1492.84 → 1494.06] not tornadoes,
[1494.46 → 1495.68] not floods,
[1496.32 → 1496.92] but harmony.
[1497.50 → 1498.38] And when I come back
[1498.38 → 1499.08] at the restoration
[1499.08 → 1499.92] of all things,
[1500.34 → 1501.38] there will be peace
[1501.38 → 1503.00] in the created order.
[1505.24 → 1505.64] Or,
[1506.14 → 1507.54] take Jesus casting out demons.
[1508.20 → 1508.34] You know,
[1508.38 → 1509.12] Western people never know
[1509.12 → 1509.78] what to do with these stories,
[1509.84 → 1510.22] but they're real
[1510.22 → 1510.88] and we have to read them
[1510.88 → 1511.48] and deal with them.
[1511.90 → 1512.74] Jesus cast out demons
[1512.74 → 1513.58] a lot in His ministry
[1513.58 → 1514.64] that tormented people
[1514.64 → 1516.18] and He sent these demons away
[1516.18 → 1516.70] so the person
[1516.70 → 1517.50] would be whole again.
[1517.60 → 1518.38] It's Jesus' way of saying,
[1518.70 → 1519.52] in my world,
[1519.62 → 1520.22] you were created
[1520.22 → 1521.32] not to be tormented,
[1521.56 → 1522.64] not to believe in lies,
[1522.72 → 1523.72] not to be dehumanized
[1523.72 → 1524.08] by them
[1524.08 → 1525.08] and hurt relationship.
[1525.20 → 1525.70] You were designed
[1525.70 → 1526.72] to be at peace
[1526.72 → 1527.32] with yourself
[1527.32 → 1529.06] and with your Heavenly Father.
[1529.68 → 1530.46] And when I come back,
[1530.52 → 1531.26] there will be no more
[1531.26 → 1532.26] tormented souls
[1532.26 → 1533.20] anywhere.
[1535.48 → 1535.84] Or,
[1536.64 → 1537.92] take Jesus raising
[1537.92 → 1538.58] the sick girl
[1538.58 → 1539.18] from the dead
[1539.18 → 1540.04] or Lazarus
[1540.04 → 1541.54] from the dead.
[1542.24 → 1543.16] These amazing
[1543.16 → 1544.18] demonstrations of power,
[1544.18 → 1544.94] not just to show
[1544.94 → 1545.70] that Jesus has
[1545.70 → 1546.38] that kind of power,
[1546.62 → 1547.28] but His way of saying,
[1547.78 → 1548.98] this world was designed
[1548.98 → 1550.16] for life,
[1550.68 → 1552.10] not death.
[1553.46 → 1554.40] And I have come
[1554.40 → 1555.52] that you might have life.
[1556.36 → 1557.14] What's the great,
[1557.28 → 1558.94] most well-known promise
[1558.94 → 1560.94] in John chapter 3, 16?
[1562.62 → 1564.40] For God so loved the world
[1564.40 → 1565.88] that He gave
[1565.88 → 1566.94] His one and only Son
[1566.94 → 1568.62] that whoever believes in Him
[1568.62 → 1570.62] will not perish,
[1571.62 → 1573.20] but have everlasting life.
[1574.18 → 1574.88] What a promise.
[1575.86 → 1576.26] And Jesus,
[1576.44 → 1577.14] in all His miracles,
[1577.24 → 1578.06] and I could tell you more,
[1578.20 → 1579.02] always is showing,
[1579.44 → 1580.12] this is the way
[1580.12 → 1581.60] the world was created to be.
[1582.02 → 1582.76] Through me,
[1582.84 → 1583.50] I was there.
[1583.74 → 1584.50] And this is the way
[1584.50 → 1585.30] I have come
[1585.30 → 1586.64] to make it again.
[1587.52 → 1589.46] God's blessing will flow.
[1589.62 → 1590.96] Evil will be pulled back
[1590.96 → 1591.94] and flourishing
[1591.94 → 1593.26] is coming again
[1593.26 → 1594.26] through me,
[1594.94 → 1595.54] says Jesus.
[1596.66 → 1597.56] Are you catching
[1597.56 → 1598.76] the hugeness of this?
[1598.76 → 1599.70] I mean,
[1599.82 → 1600.90] I would almost describe
[1600.90 → 1601.78] the way I see this
[1601.78 → 1602.84] as a conversion experience
[1602.84 → 1603.22] for me.
[1603.88 → 1604.96] That the salvation of Jesus
[1604.96 → 1606.16] is not just me and Jesus,
[1606.28 → 1606.90] Him pulling me out
[1606.90 → 1607.28] of this world.
[1607.54 → 1608.30] It's Jesus bringing
[1608.30 → 1609.10] His wholeness
[1609.10 → 1610.26] and healing and blessing
[1610.26 → 1611.72] to the entirety of creation,
[1611.82 → 1612.98] to every corner,
[1613.32 → 1614.00] every corner
[1614.00 → 1615.04] that's been affected
[1615.04 → 1615.92] by sin.
[1616.50 → 1617.30] Our social lives,
[1617.36 → 1618.14] our economic lives,
[1618.22 → 1619.02] our sexual lives,
[1619.10 → 1619.90] our relational lives,
[1620.02 → 1621.10] our psychological lives,
[1621.22 → 1622.30] all of it
[1622.30 → 1623.96] will be healed.
[1623.96 → 1627.50] Chris Wright,
[1627.58 → 1628.44] an Old Testament scholar
[1628.44 → 1629.66] who I've appreciated
[1629.66 → 1630.56] a lot over the last
[1630.56 → 1631.12] number of years,
[1631.60 → 1632.80] he once said in a lecture,
[1632.92 → 1633.82] and I'm paraphrasing here,
[1633.88 → 1634.80] but I really like this,
[1634.84 → 1635.08] he said,
[1635.18 → 1635.88] God's intention
[1635.88 → 1636.74] in sending Jesus
[1636.74 → 1638.56] is not to clean us up
[1638.56 → 1639.36] so He can pull us
[1639.36 → 1640.08] out of this world.
[1641.26 → 1642.08] God's intention
[1642.08 → 1643.32] in Jesus
[1643.32 → 1644.74] is to clean up
[1644.74 → 1645.60] the whole of creation,
[1645.74 → 1646.76] including us,
[1646.76 → 1648.26] so that God might dwell
[1648.26 → 1649.70] forever with us.
[1650.76 → 1652.14] How does the story end?
[1652.82 → 1653.76] Revelation 21,
[1653.96 → 1656.26] God coming to dwell
[1656.26 → 1657.28] with His people,
[1657.96 → 1659.26] wiping away their tears,
[1659.74 → 1660.46] living with them
[1660.46 → 1662.92] in a whole new creation.
[1664.34 → 1665.80] That's our Advent hope,
[1666.26 → 1667.64] and that comes in
[1667.64 → 1668.52] and through this child
[1668.52 → 1669.82] born in obscurity
[1669.82 → 1671.22] who will bring
[1671.22 → 1672.56] God's blessing.
[1676.06 → 1676.78] Dale Brunei,
[1676.86 → 1677.82] who wrote a very big,
[1677.96 → 1678.44] thick commentary
[1678.44 → 1679.68] on the Gospel of John,
[1680.66 → 1681.28] as he looks at
[1681.28 → 1681.96] these opening words,
[1682.04 → 1682.26] he says,
[1682.34 → 1682.92] this is not just
[1682.92 → 1684.14] a magnificent statement
[1684.14 → 1684.84] of Jesus being
[1684.84 → 1685.68] the eternal Word,
[1685.78 → 1686.54] of Jesus being there
[1686.54 → 1687.22] from the creation,
[1687.50 → 1688.78] of the story starting
[1688.78 → 1689.58] that making sense
[1689.58 → 1690.68] of why Jesus came.
[1690.92 → 1692.66] It's also a Gospel invitation.
[1693.82 → 1694.58] And I'll quote
[1694.58 → 1696.24] Dale Brunei for you.
[1696.30 → 1696.72] He writes,
[1696.72 → 1700.40] come into union with the Word,
[1700.40 → 1701.56] who you were made for,
[1702.06 → 1703.82] and you will come to life.
[1704.46 → 1705.60] You came from Him.
[1706.34 → 1707.76] Please come back to Him.
[1708.22 → 1709.80] You were made for Him.
[1710.36 → 1711.68] The result of this reunion
[1711.68 → 1712.98] will be more than human existence.
[1713.14 → 1714.66] It will be human life,
[1715.50 → 1716.78] meaningful life,
[1717.50 → 1718.32] or I'd put it,
[1718.70 → 1720.20] the life of blessing.
[1721.40 → 1722.42] And I love that quote
[1722.42 → 1723.52] because the way Dale
[1723.52 → 1724.82] is describing Jesus' ministry
[1724.82 → 1726.32] is as you come into contact
[1726.32 → 1726.78] with Jesus,
[1726.88 → 1727.92] as you take hold of Jesus
[1727.92 → 1728.86] by faith,
[1729.08 → 1730.34] you come to life.
[1731.18 → 1732.52] Your relationships come to life.
[1732.58 → 1733.54] Your marriage comes to life.
[1733.60 → 1734.56] Your work comes to life.
[1734.70 → 1735.80] When you follow Jesus,
[1735.92 → 1737.26] you now get put back
[1737.26 → 1737.88] to the way
[1737.88 → 1739.60] you were created to live.
[1740.14 → 1741.56] He recalibrates you
[1741.56 → 1743.48] in line with God's design.
[1744.66 → 1746.02] He aligns your heart
[1746.02 → 1748.00] with your created shape.
[1749.20 → 1750.20] Does that make sense?
[1750.20 → 1751.74] That's what Jesus
[1751.74 → 1752.76] has come to do.
[1754.36 → 1755.18] And when we look
[1755.18 → 1756.00] at the cross,
[1756.26 → 1757.06] which is, you know,
[1757.10 → 1757.94] it starts with the incarnation,
[1758.10 → 1758.78] we move to the cross,
[1758.84 → 1759.50] which moved.
[1759.74 → 1760.88] It's in the fireside room.
[1761.72 → 1762.30] In the first service,
[1762.36 → 1763.02] I didn't notice that.
[1763.10 → 1763.94] I just pointed over there
[1763.94 → 1764.50] and everyone just looked
[1764.50 → 1765.22] at this empty room.
[1765.50 → 1766.98] The cross in the fireside room.
[1767.38 → 1768.64] That's Jesus' way of saying,
[1768.76 → 1769.86] I have come to deal
[1769.86 → 1770.42] with the sin
[1770.42 → 1771.08] that has infected
[1771.08 → 1771.78] and perverted
[1771.78 → 1773.24] every piece of created life.
[1773.40 → 1774.60] I will take that on me.
[1774.70 → 1776.18] I will destroy its power,
[1776.32 → 1776.98] bring it to the grave,
[1776.98 → 1780.10] so you can experience blessing.
[1783.82 → 1784.60] I want to finish
[1784.60 → 1785.10] with a story
[1785.10 → 1785.98] about a Russian priest
[1785.98 → 1787.36] named John of Kronstadt.
[1788.30 → 1789.64] Lived in the 19th century
[1789.64 → 1790.28] in Russia,
[1790.76 → 1792.12] served in an Orthodox parish,
[1792.48 → 1793.74] and he lived at a time
[1793.74 → 1794.16] where there was
[1794.16 → 1795.74] rampant alcoholism
[1795.74 → 1797.30] that was destroying the city,
[1797.46 → 1797.94] and at night,
[1798.00 → 1798.44] it was a place
[1798.44 → 1799.20] where you wouldn't want to be
[1799.20 → 1800.32] just to do all the violence
[1800.32 → 1801.00] and all the stuff
[1801.00 → 1801.48] that happened
[1801.48 → 1802.92] with alcohol addiction.
[1803.72 → 1804.76] And he was part of a parish
[1804.76 → 1805.26] where there's a number
[1805.26 → 1805.86] of other priests,
[1805.90 → 1806.42] and they would often
[1806.42 → 1807.96] just sort of stay in there,
[1808.00 → 1808.82] and if people came in
[1808.82 → 1809.34] from the streets,
[1809.42 → 1810.38] they would minister to them
[1810.38 → 1811.08] and care for them.
[1811.36 → 1812.62] But John felt compelled
[1812.62 → 1814.74] to go out to the streets,
[1815.16 → 1816.40] and he'd go to the alleyways,
[1816.50 → 1817.26] he'd go to the gutters
[1817.26 → 1817.86] where there'd be people
[1817.86 → 1818.78] in a drunken stupor
[1818.78 → 1819.64] bent over.
[1820.04 → 1820.80] They would smell
[1820.80 → 1822.28] of wretched throw-up,
[1822.76 → 1823.48] and he was told,
[1823.58 → 1824.04] people told,
[1824.12 → 1824.98] that he would cradle
[1824.98 → 1826.38] these people in his arms,
[1827.14 → 1828.90] and he would simply say to them,
[1829.44 → 1831.68] this is beneath your dignity.
[1833.10 → 1834.30] You were created
[1834.30 → 1836.22] to house the fullness of God.
[1836.42 → 1838.86] That was his ministry.
[1839.74 → 1842.54] This is beneath your dignity.
[1843.38 → 1844.08] You were created
[1844.08 → 1845.62] to house the fullness of God.
[1847.54 → 1848.48] And that ministry
[1848.48 → 1849.72] to the broken streets
[1849.72 → 1850.74] of his city,
[1851.00 → 1851.54] I think,
[1851.60 → 1852.66] is a small glimpse
[1852.66 → 1853.82] of what Jesus did
[1853.82 → 1855.42] in his entire earthly ministry.
[1856.46 → 1857.24] Jesus, you should know,
[1857.28 → 1857.90] was not protected
[1857.90 → 1858.58] from the violence
[1858.58 → 1859.34] and pain of this world.
[1859.42 → 1860.02] At the age of two,
[1860.08 → 1861.12] we talked about this last year,
[1861.46 → 1862.70] Jesus was fleeing to Egypt
[1862.70 → 1863.50] because there was a price
[1863.50 → 1863.98] on his head
[1863.98 → 1864.56] to kill him.
[1864.92 → 1865.62] He's a refugee.
[1866.28 → 1866.98] As he grows up,
[1867.00 → 1868.32] he saw all the violence of Rome.
[1868.42 → 1869.38] He saw all the injustice,
[1869.50 → 1869.96] all the pain,
[1870.04 → 1870.54] all the loss,
[1870.60 → 1871.14] all the homelessness,
[1871.50 → 1872.88] nothing he was protected from.
[1873.56 → 1874.88] And as Jesus did his ministry,
[1874.94 → 1875.40] as he healed,
[1875.48 → 1876.00] as he taught,
[1876.04 → 1876.94] as he broke bread with people,
[1877.10 → 1878.50] he's constantly lifting
[1878.50 → 1879.84] people's faces to say,
[1879.84 → 1883.28] you were created for blessing.
[1884.54 → 1886.06] This world is harsh
[1886.06 → 1887.84] and it is beneath your dignity
[1887.84 → 1889.12] to live in the pain
[1889.12 → 1890.10] and brokenness of sin.
[1890.38 → 1891.36] I have come
[1891.36 → 1894.16] that you would have life.
[1895.00 → 1896.04] I have come
[1896.04 → 1897.34] to push the darkness
[1897.34 → 1898.54] out of this creation
[1898.54 → 1900.04] so that it may radiate
[1900.04 → 1900.88] with the light
[1900.88 → 1902.74] of the Son of the living God.
[1904.28 → 1905.76] Come, follow me
[1905.76 → 1908.10] and taste blessing.
[1910.64 → 1912.02] That's our Advent hope.
[1912.86 → 1913.88] Would you join me in prayer?
[1917.78 → 1919.28] Father, we thank you so much
[1919.28 → 1920.12] for your word.
[1921.44 → 1922.20] And we thank you
[1922.20 → 1922.80] that even today
[1922.80 → 1923.94] we get to hear John
[1923.94 → 1925.68] speaking of Jesus
[1925.68 → 1926.88] as the eternal word,
[1927.82 → 1929.48] of Jesus bringing your blessing.
[1930.66 → 1931.38] And we pray
[1931.38 → 1932.20] that you would forgive us
[1932.20 → 1932.62] for the ways
[1932.62 → 1934.38] that we make Jesus so small,
[1935.86 → 1936.44] the way he's such
[1936.44 → 1938.04] an insignificant sort of
[1938.04 → 1939.98] trite piece of our lives.
[1940.88 → 1941.36] And we pray
[1941.36 → 1941.90] that we would know
[1941.90 → 1942.52] how to follow
[1942.52 → 1943.66] the cosmic Jesus,
[1944.50 → 1946.80] to live in line
[1946.80 → 1947.64] with his design.
[1948.92 → 1950.00] We pray that you would
[1950.00 → 1951.20] fill us with your spirit
[1951.20 → 1953.22] and that our lives
[1953.22 → 1953.66] would be one
[1953.66 → 1955.46] of increasingly experiencing
[1955.46 → 1956.32] the blessing
[1956.32 → 1957.40] we are created for.
[1958.26 → 1958.58] Amen.
[1958.58 → 1962.18] I invite you to stand
[1962.18 → 1962.88] and sing with me
[1962.88 → 1963.84] our song of response.
[1963.94 → 1964.36] This is actually
[1964.36 → 1965.02] an Advent song
[1965.02 → 1965.46] we're going to sing
[1965.46 → 1966.40] throughout the season.
[1966.56 → 1966.96] It is
[1966.96 → 1968.06] The Blessing.
[1968.06 → 1969.92] Amen.
