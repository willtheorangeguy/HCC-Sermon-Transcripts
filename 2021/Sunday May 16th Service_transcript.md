[30.00 --> 33.26]  Thumbs up from Charlotte. Okay. I didn't get a thumbs up from Kim.
[36.28 --> 39.04]  It is good to be together online and in person.
[39.36 --> 42.56]  And I just want to say again, it's such a gift to see some faces I haven't seen for a while.
[42.92 --> 43.84]  And some new faces.
[44.16 --> 50.52]  You know, I feel like I got quietly rebuked in this regathering because I was lamenting a little bit this live stream
[50.52 --> 53.68]  and how strange it is to do these worship services with only 10 people in the church.
[54.20 --> 57.60]  And now I see some new people who found our church through the live stream.
[57.60 --> 59.00]  And so we give thanks to that.
[59.00 --> 62.02]  And thanks to God for bringing you here and some of the faces that we haven't met.
[62.34 --> 64.08]  We're just grateful that we can be together.
[64.28 --> 67.74]  And we hope that you can get to know this church and this community and grow with us.
[69.24 --> 72.08]  We're going to jump back into our series on Revelation.
[72.38 --> 76.94]  If you've been tracking with us the last number of weeks, we're looking at the letters to the churches in Asia Minor.
[77.44 --> 80.88]  And this morning we're looking at the letter to the church in Sardis.
[80.88 --> 87.22]  And if you're keen, attentive to our series, you'll know I'm jumping over the letter to Thyatira.
[87.40 --> 88.62]  And that's not because I don't like that letter.
[88.72 --> 93.28]  It's mostly because of our preaching schedule and also the common theme between Pergamum and Thyatira.
[93.44 --> 96.48]  So this morning we're jumping over to the church in Sardis.
[96.56 --> 99.96]  So if you have your Bible, turn with me to Revelation chapter 3.
[100.78 --> 102.62]  I'm going to read the first six verses.
[102.62 --> 106.66]  That's the letter to the church in Sardis.
[110.40 --> 113.06]  To the angel of the church in Sardis write,
[113.86 --> 119.42]  These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.
[120.00 --> 121.36]  I know your deeds.
[121.98 --> 126.30]  You have a reputation for being alive, but you are dead.
[127.20 --> 127.74]  Wake up.
[128.44 --> 130.48]  Strengthen what remains and is about to die.
[130.48 --> 133.98]  For I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God.
[134.98 --> 137.62]  Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard.
[138.30 --> 140.42]  Hold it fast and repent.
[141.32 --> 143.96]  But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief,
[144.00 --> 146.52]  and you will not know at what time I will come to you.
[147.64 --> 151.00]  Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes.
[151.60 --> 155.38]  They will walk with me dressed in white, for they are worthy.
[156.40 --> 159.48]  The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white.
[159.48 --> 163.76]  I will never blot out their name of that person from the book of life,
[164.12 --> 167.26]  but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels.
[168.50 --> 173.48]  Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[175.52 --> 178.10]  So far, the reading of God's Word this morning.
[178.10 --> 183.02]  Well, last week, I started with a story of Brittany and I moving here,
[183.08 --> 184.94]  and I'm just going to continue right where I left off.
[185.26 --> 186.62]  I probably won't do that next week.
[187.34 --> 190.90]  But when we first arrived here, and Brittany and I moved into our little basement suite in Burnaby,
[191.52 --> 194.48]  we had just gotten married and needed to pick up a number of household items,
[194.60 --> 196.50]  and so we had to do some shopping,
[196.70 --> 199.96]  which is not one of my favorite things to do, as Brittany can attest to.
[200.52 --> 204.56]  But my father-in-law, Mike, put me onto this thing called the auctions.
[204.56 --> 206.64]  Has anyone here been to an auction?
[208.66 --> 212.62]  So I don't like shopping, but I learned quickly that I like competitive shopping.
[213.62 --> 214.84]  I like the auctions.
[215.16 --> 217.14]  And so whenever we had a free Thursday night,
[217.68 --> 220.30]  we would go down to Abbotsford, and we'd go down to the auction,
[220.44 --> 222.32]  and we would bid for the things that we needed.
[222.40 --> 225.26]  And sometimes we'd bid on really cheap things we didn't need,
[225.28 --> 227.74]  only to find out when we brought them home, they didn't work,
[228.00 --> 229.10]  and that's why they were so cheap.
[229.10 --> 234.70]  But I have one favorite, and it's sort of a legend in our family story of going to the auctions,
[234.82 --> 236.14]  and it wasn't about something I purchased.
[236.26 --> 238.20]  It was about something my father-in-law, Mike, purchased.
[239.28 --> 241.80]  You see, the Gohens have a history of buying used cars.
[241.90 --> 244.56]  They like cars that are old, and if they crash, it doesn't even matter.
[245.06 --> 247.26]  And the car that they had at that time was on its way out,
[247.32 --> 250.56]  and so Mike was on the market for another old car.
[251.24 --> 254.58]  And it just so happened that that night there were a bunch of old cars for sale,
[254.58 --> 259.56]  one of which was a shiny, black Nissan Maxima.
[259.64 --> 260.56]  I can still picture it.
[260.86 --> 263.58]  We walked around that car, we thought, this thing's amazing.
[263.98 --> 264.68]  Good condition.
[265.06 --> 266.02]  We stepped inside.
[266.12 --> 268.36]  It had leather seats, low kilometers.
[268.72 --> 270.32]  This is the car Mike was going to bid on.
[270.92 --> 274.38]  So we walked around that car, and the bidding time finally came to these vehicles,
[275.02 --> 278.26]  and the auctioneer started the bidding off at thousands of dollars.
[278.68 --> 279.78]  Nobody raised their hand.
[280.46 --> 281.08]  $2,000.
[281.42 --> 283.20]  No one raised their hand, and we're getting excited.
[283.20 --> 284.52]  $1,000.
[284.96 --> 285.94]  No one raised their hand.
[287.00 --> 287.56]  $500.
[289.32 --> 290.64]  Mike raised his hand.
[291.18 --> 293.00]  Put his hand up boldly, confidently.
[293.14 --> 293.92]  This is a good deal.
[294.58 --> 295.82]  The auctioneer went up to $600.
[296.32 --> 296.76]  $700.
[297.40 --> 298.28]  Nobody bid.
[298.54 --> 300.76]  And so those famous words, sold.
[301.52 --> 305.14]  And right there and then, Mike became the owner of that black, shiny Nissan Maxima.
[305.74 --> 308.20]  We were so excited about that purchase.
[308.34 --> 309.84]  We talked about it the whole way home.
[309.84 --> 312.92]  That car represented everything we loved about auctions.
[313.76 --> 317.30]  The next day, the next evening rather, we drove back, and we had to pick up the car,
[317.42 --> 318.90]  and Mike had to do the paperwork for the car.
[319.28 --> 322.36]  And I dropped him off and drove on ahead saying, I'll meet you at your place when you're being
[322.36 --> 323.22]  in the car back to your home.
[323.92 --> 325.54]  I got there, and I waited.
[325.54 --> 327.42]  And I waited.
[328.54 --> 329.42]  And I waited.
[330.20 --> 335.32]  Until two hours later, I got a call from an unknown number, and it was Mike Goheen calling
[335.32 --> 337.40]  me on the cell phone of the tow truck driver.
[337.40 --> 343.46]  And he was on the side of the Portman Bridge where that dead car resided.
[344.02 --> 348.02]  And the tow truck driver opened up the hood, and he told Mike in no uncertain terms, he
[348.02 --> 350.50]  said, that engine, sir, is toast.
[351.78 --> 353.64]  That was the last auction we ever went to.
[353.64 --> 362.16]  We were so deceived by that shiny, black, nice-smelling, low-kilometer Nissan Maxima.
[363.52 --> 368.52]  And the reason I tell you this story is because a lot of churches are like that car.
[368.52 --> 377.18]  Very well presented, look nice, present well, are very attractive to the outside eye, but
[377.18 --> 379.86]  you lift the hood, and it doesn't look good.
[381.16 --> 384.22]  That's the story of the church in Sardis.
[384.90 --> 387.10]  It's a story that looks good.
[387.66 --> 389.20]  It's a church that presents well.
[389.52 --> 392.16]  It has an appeal even to the neighbors in the city.
[392.26 --> 393.52]  It has a good reputation.
[394.02 --> 398.50]  But Jesus looks at the church, and he says in no uncertain terms, you're dead.
[398.52 --> 402.82]  That's the story of the church in Sardis.
[403.58 --> 408.36]  And this morning, we want to look at why Jesus says that to this church.
[408.76 --> 412.08]  I mean, think of all the churches in the past Jesus has talked to that we've looked at.
[412.54 --> 414.80]  He says to Ephesus, you lack love.
[415.52 --> 418.60]  He says to the church in Smyrna, you're suffering and you're weak.
[418.68 --> 419.16]  Hold on.
[419.42 --> 423.30]  He says to the church in Pergamum, you didn't renounce my name.
[423.40 --> 426.50]  And to the church in Sardis, you're dead.
[426.90 --> 428.48]  This is a serious letter.
[428.52 --> 435.42]  To a church that needs to wake up, remember who they are, whose they are, why they exist in this city,
[435.58 --> 438.96]  and reclaim what it means to be the church of Jesus Christ.
[440.80 --> 445.60]  So let's take a look at what Jesus says to his church in the city of Sardis.
[445.68 --> 450.42]  He starts with a statement, and every one of these letters starts with a statement about Jesus himself.
[450.86 --> 454.12]  And we read, sorry, my Bible is flipping pages every two seconds.
[454.18 --> 455.02]  I'm losing my page.
[455.02 --> 456.62]  I'm going to hold the Bible.
[456.80 --> 456.96]  Okay.
[457.32 --> 462.76]  He says to the church, these are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.
[463.48 --> 467.30]  And remember, the stars represent the angels for each church.
[467.30 --> 471.74]  And the lampstands we read in Revelation 1 represents the churches themselves.
[472.22 --> 476.52]  And this is one way of Jesus saying, these churches belong to me.
[476.84 --> 481.00]  The angels, the churches themselves, I hold them in my hand.
[481.68 --> 487.54]  And I think it's a way of Jesus saying to the church in Sardis, your church doesn't belong to you.
[487.54 --> 489.26]  It belongs to me.
[490.14 --> 491.46]  And churches can forget that.
[491.94 --> 496.70]  We can think that somehow these churches belong to us, that we call the shots, that we determine where they go,
[496.76 --> 498.92]  that we have the authority over their direction.
[499.02 --> 500.80]  And Jesus says, I hold them.
[500.80 --> 511.04]  And if it's true that Jesus owns the church, that they belong to him, then faithful churches will want to attune themselves to his purposes,
[511.66 --> 515.02]  align themselves with Jesus' ambition for the churches in the city,
[515.26 --> 519.80]  and watch out when you deviate from his purpose for the church.
[519.80 --> 524.74]  And then Jesus gets right into it with addressing them.
[524.82 --> 530.82]  Now, I want to ask you the question, did anyone notice something missing from this letter to the church in Sardis?
[532.60 --> 538.46]  There's something glaringly absent from this church, the letter that Jesus gives through John to the church.
[538.52 --> 539.52]  Did you notice it, anyone?
[540.16 --> 543.36]  I'm looking at Pastor Sid thinking, he's the keen one, he should know.
[543.82 --> 546.06]  And he's shaking his head, please don't put me on the spot.
[546.06 --> 548.54]  But, you know what's missing?
[549.18 --> 549.96]  It's encouragement.
[551.28 --> 556.10]  In every letter so far, Jesus has spoken right into the pain and the difficulty, and he says,
[556.52 --> 558.48]  Ephesus, I've seen your hard work.
[558.82 --> 562.74]  I've seen how you're looking at false teachers and you won't let them have a voice in the church.
[563.06 --> 566.08]  Smyrna, I see how you're holding on amidst persecution.
[566.70 --> 570.16]  Pergamum, I see the way that you haven't renounced the faith,
[570.58 --> 572.74]  even though people in your community have been martyred.
[572.74 --> 577.50]  Thyatira, I've seen how you love and how you have faith and hard work with one another.
[578.10 --> 580.34]  Sardis, crickets.
[582.32 --> 585.20]  And just imagine for a moment being the church in Sardis,
[585.28 --> 589.32]  gathered together and having probably one of the elders in the church read this letter.
[590.00 --> 594.36]  And remember, this is a circular letter, so they probably read all the other letters first.
[594.64 --> 599.06]  And then they get to them, and there's not a shred of encouragement at the beginning of this letter.
[599.06 --> 602.66]  I have a feeling there would have been a lot of silence.
[603.48 --> 604.96]  This is a serious letter.
[605.76 --> 606.90]  And what does Jesus say to them?
[606.94 --> 608.06]  Right off the hop, Jesus says,
[608.68 --> 610.26]  I know your deeds.
[610.44 --> 615.72]  You have a reputation for being alive, but you are dead.
[617.38 --> 617.68]  Whew.
[618.56 --> 620.74]  Imagine Jesus saying that to us as a church.
[621.20 --> 622.18]  You have a reputation.
[622.38 --> 625.26]  People think you're alive, but you're dead.
[625.26 --> 630.40]  Neighboring churches in other cities probably looked up to Sardis.
[630.54 --> 631.80]  They're the biggest church, by the way.
[631.86 --> 634.14]  Of all the seven churches, Sardis is the biggest church.
[634.78 --> 637.14]  Perhaps they looked up and wanted to be like Sardis.
[637.50 --> 639.06]  Perhaps people in the city looked up at the church,
[639.10 --> 641.26]  and they were impressed by the things they were doing
[641.26 --> 643.68]  and the way they held themselves as a community.
[643.98 --> 647.26]  But Jesus pierces right through how the city sees them,
[647.32 --> 649.48]  how the churches see them, maybe even how they see themselves.
[649.48 --> 654.98]  And he says to them, I see you, and you're a church that is dying.
[656.66 --> 658.58]  That begs the question, why?
[659.10 --> 660.32]  I want to read for you a quote.
[660.84 --> 662.48]  Those of you who are online, you get to see it.
[662.52 --> 664.62]  But those of you in person, that's the punishment.
[664.82 --> 665.64]  You just have to hear it.
[666.58 --> 669.34]  This is how Daryl Johnson describes the church in Sardis.
[670.14 --> 671.80]  He says, it was a very active church.
[672.18 --> 673.84]  All kinds of events were taking place.
[673.92 --> 677.60]  All kinds of committees and meetings were discussing plans and strategizing.
[677.60 --> 680.38]  The church in Sardis was well organized.
[680.82 --> 681.70]  Doctrine was sound.
[681.90 --> 684.14]  Sacraments were celebrated regularly and orderly.
[684.64 --> 687.10]  The church in Sardis was the largest of the seven.
[687.72 --> 689.34]  Services would have been well attended.
[689.66 --> 691.60]  It was certainly the wealthiest.
[692.62 --> 695.66]  Fabulously wealthy, as one commentator put it.
[696.08 --> 700.14]  And yet Jesus says, you are dead.
[701.26 --> 704.10]  And that begs the question, what is going on in this church?
[704.10 --> 709.48]  Why would Jesus give such a devastating assessment of a church gathering in his name?
[710.26 --> 711.14]  What's the story?
[711.28 --> 712.18]  And let's look at that together.
[712.28 --> 715.42]  I think there's a clue in verse two where we read,
[715.68 --> 718.26]  Wake up, strengthen what remains and is about to die,
[718.36 --> 722.22]  for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God.
[724.26 --> 728.60]  Some suggest that this is an ambitious church in terms of its ideas and its plans and its visions,
[729.06 --> 731.14]  but they never actually do anything.
[731.14 --> 734.64]  They have a vision for how to reach the city, a vision for how they want to serve,
[734.74 --> 737.30]  a vision for who they want to be, but they're actually not doing anything.
[738.46 --> 742.42]  Other writers suggest that this is a church that has settled for mediocrity.
[742.92 --> 744.60]  They're not doing a whole lot of anything.
[744.72 --> 751.10]  They're just kind of coasting, settled, comfortable, doing their little thing, privatizing their faith.
[751.36 --> 753.02]  They've settled in for mediocrity.
[753.02 --> 758.30]  Others have said they're busy, but with the wrong things.
[758.68 --> 759.76]  This is a church that's active.
[759.88 --> 762.04]  Perhaps they have all sorts of, okay, now I'm going extemporaneous,
[762.38 --> 764.20]  all sorts of stuff happening in the church,
[764.46 --> 767.66]  but they're not actually tending to the most important things.
[767.74 --> 770.22]  And here's a sobering reality for church then and now.
[770.90 --> 774.80]  You can be busy, but you might not be doing the Father's work.
[775.46 --> 777.08]  You can be really active.
[777.20 --> 778.42]  You can have exhausted leaders,
[778.42 --> 782.90]  but you may not actually be doing the very thing you've been called to do by Jesus.
[783.72 --> 785.06]  That's a sobering thought.
[786.72 --> 788.28]  And Jesus' words to them is,
[788.46 --> 790.60]  I see it, and you're dead.
[792.82 --> 796.40]  Now, I happen to think that this is a word in season to our churches,
[796.82 --> 799.20]  and I'm guessing you already feel some of the challenge.
[799.30 --> 800.28]  Oh, thank you.
[802.60 --> 803.70]  Thank you so much.
[803.70 --> 812.60]  My hunch is that the issue in the church in Sardis is assimilation.
[813.06 --> 815.76]  And there's overlap between Sardis and Pergamum and Thyatira here.
[815.84 --> 819.64]  I think all of these churches are compromising and assimilating in different ways,
[819.94 --> 823.30]  but I think Sardis has a unique challenge in their assimilation.
[823.94 --> 828.38]  And there's another thing absent from this letter that attentive eyes would notice.
[828.38 --> 833.74]  In Ephesus, the church is commended for suffering under persecution.
[834.62 --> 837.72]  In Pergamum, they're commended for suffering persecution.
[838.46 --> 841.50]  In Smyrna, they're commended for suffering under persecution,
[841.64 --> 843.62]  even though they are weak and they are powerless.
[844.18 --> 847.02]  In Sardis, there's not a word spoken about persecution.
[848.24 --> 849.00]  It leaves you with the question,
[849.12 --> 852.46]  why is this church not being named for suffering?
[852.46 --> 855.30]  I agree with those who say,
[855.40 --> 858.58]  perhaps there is no reason for this church to be persecuted.
[858.98 --> 860.98]  They've blended in so effectively.
[861.34 --> 862.76]  They've gotten so comfortable.
[862.94 --> 865.94]  They've sort of dialed down their Christian differences
[865.94 --> 869.00]  to such a degree that there's no reason for them to get persecuted.
[869.62 --> 870.76]  They're making no waves.
[870.96 --> 872.14]  They're making no disciples.
[872.36 --> 874.22]  They're not speaking up about the gospel.
[874.52 --> 877.58]  They're not publicly witnessing that Jesus is Lord of all.
[877.92 --> 879.48]  And so why would they be persecuted?
[880.38 --> 881.76]  Or as a different person put it,
[881.76 --> 884.18]  Satan isn't threatened by this kind of church.
[884.72 --> 889.28]  There's no reason to bear down on them in offensive and very forceful ways
[889.28 --> 891.10]  because they blend right in.
[891.86 --> 893.42]  They're no threat to him.
[894.28 --> 897.30]  This is a chameleon church that has assimilated.
[898.98 --> 900.84]  And here's what I think beyond that.
[900.94 --> 902.08]  This is just my own conjecture.
[902.18 --> 904.48]  I don't think the church in Sardis ever had a leadership meeting
[904.48 --> 906.56]  where they said, you know what we're going to do here in this city,
[906.94 --> 908.52]  this wealthy, profitable city?
[908.64 --> 910.52]  We're going to blend in for safety.
[910.52 --> 914.06]  We're going to very carefully tone down our Christian message,
[914.18 --> 916.84]  very carefully tone down what distinctives we believe about Jesus
[916.84 --> 918.18]  over against the Roman Empire,
[918.30 --> 920.66]  and we're just going to coast along safely,
[921.40 --> 923.00]  protect our profits that we have.
[923.08 --> 924.10]  Again, it's a wealthy city,
[924.10 --> 926.22]  and we're going to play the safe road.
[926.62 --> 927.92]  I don't think the leaders had that meeting.
[928.60 --> 930.88]  I think the story of the church in Sardis,
[931.36 --> 932.78]  which is the story of many churches,
[932.78 --> 936.92]  is a thousand small concessions.
[937.92 --> 942.20]  A thousand small decisions for safety,
[942.74 --> 945.00]  for comfort, for wealth,
[945.40 --> 948.30]  for fitting in and not having any trouble as the church.
[948.50 --> 951.30]  I think it was small decision after small decision,
[951.44 --> 952.88]  year by year by year,
[953.22 --> 955.44]  where they just sort of blended in,
[956.16 --> 958.22]  just sort of went with the flow.
[958.22 --> 960.36]  And Jesus sees this church,
[960.42 --> 960.78]  and he says,
[960.90 --> 962.66]  you have the appearance of being alive.
[963.18 --> 964.64]  You have the respect of other churches.
[964.76 --> 965.20]  You're wealthy,
[965.34 --> 966.10]  and I see you,
[966.54 --> 967.52]  and you're dead.
[969.20 --> 970.26]  Now just pause.
[970.98 --> 973.52]  Are you feeling the challenge of this letter?
[973.62 --> 973.82]  Anybody?
[973.82 --> 973.94]  Anybody?
[976.54 --> 978.32]  I feel the challenge of this letter.
[979.04 --> 981.62]  And I've been feeling the challenge of each of these letters in different ways,
[981.70 --> 984.20]  and something about Sardis is just kind of getting under my skin.
[984.28 --> 985.72]  And maybe it's just my pastoral sensitivity,
[985.92 --> 986.94]  but there's something about this letter
[986.94 --> 989.72]  that feels like an alarm bell for a lot of Western churches.
[990.44 --> 991.50]  Because whether you know it or not,
[991.56 --> 993.70]  we're living in our own Sardis called Surrey.
[993.96 --> 996.32]  And Surrey, just like Sardis, is not a poor city,
[996.78 --> 997.42]  even though there's,
[997.84 --> 999.38]  I realize in every city there's challenges.
[999.72 --> 1000.42]  But on the whole,
[1000.50 --> 1002.46]  we live in one of the wealthiest parts of the world.
[1002.46 --> 1004.52]  And most of us are not struggling.
[1004.96 --> 1006.56]  We have our own Sardis context.
[1008.24 --> 1009.66]  You know, about three months ago,
[1010.08 --> 1011.20]  Val, wherever Val is,
[1011.64 --> 1012.08]  where's Val?
[1012.20 --> 1012.62]  There she is.
[1012.84 --> 1013.86]  She handed me a book.
[1014.50 --> 1015.62]  And whenever someone hands me a book,
[1015.68 --> 1017.00]  I'm like, okay, I should probably read this.
[1017.26 --> 1017.74]  Especially Val.
[1017.82 --> 1018.84]  She's our discipleship coordinator.
[1018.96 --> 1020.10]  And the name of the book was
[1020.10 --> 1022.60]  Autopsy of a Deceased Church.
[1023.88 --> 1024.38]  Sobering title.
[1024.46 --> 1026.24]  Actually, it has a picture of a scalpel,
[1026.72 --> 1027.44]  which is, you know,
[1027.54 --> 1029.12]  I don't like scalpels.
[1029.44 --> 1030.88]  So it's a very serious title.
[1030.88 --> 1033.18]  And the book is basically a number of interviews
[1033.18 --> 1035.54]  that people did with churches,
[1035.70 --> 1038.02]  with leaders and members of churches that had died.
[1038.74 --> 1039.78]  And they met with these people,
[1039.86 --> 1040.74]  and they interviewed these people,
[1040.78 --> 1041.56]  and they asked the question,
[1041.68 --> 1044.92]  tell us the story of how this came to be.
[1045.32 --> 1047.24]  Tell us the story of how you used to be a church
[1047.24 --> 1047.92]  that was alive,
[1048.02 --> 1049.60]  and many of them were big at one point.
[1049.78 --> 1051.12]  What led to your demise?
[1051.26 --> 1052.02]  And the leader saying,
[1052.38 --> 1054.42]  we have to close and close up shop.
[1054.66 --> 1055.92]  Our church is now dead.
[1056.56 --> 1057.40]  So that's the book.
[1057.40 --> 1059.54]  There are many interesting things in the book
[1059.54 --> 1061.80]  that I found very challenging as a leader.
[1061.92 --> 1063.34]  In fact, one of the reasons churches die
[1063.34 --> 1064.38]  is poor leadership,
[1064.82 --> 1065.44]  weak leadership,
[1065.78 --> 1066.70]  leading out of fear,
[1067.42 --> 1069.80]  being preoccupied with the internal life of the church.
[1069.88 --> 1071.44]  In fact, that was a main point of this book,
[1071.52 --> 1072.72]  is that churches that die
[1072.72 --> 1073.34]  are often churches
[1073.34 --> 1074.76]  that aren't even thinking about the city.
[1074.98 --> 1076.96]  They're just fretting over the color of the carpet,
[1077.38 --> 1078.42]  having some internal divisions
[1078.42 --> 1079.46]  about secondary issues,
[1079.62 --> 1081.20]  and that is bound for death.
[1081.74 --> 1083.70]  But the chapter that caught my attention the most
[1083.70 --> 1084.66]  was a chapter called,
[1084.66 --> 1088.38]  when the Great Commission becomes the Great Omission.
[1089.32 --> 1091.98]  And they told story after story after story
[1091.98 --> 1093.74]  of people who were part of churches
[1093.74 --> 1095.78]  where the people just honestly confessed,
[1096.68 --> 1101.28]  we did not share the gospel with anybody.
[1102.24 --> 1104.98]  We did not concern ourselves with speaking our faith,
[1105.20 --> 1107.44]  even sharing why we believe in Jesus.
[1107.56 --> 1108.54]  It didn't come up at work.
[1108.66 --> 1110.00]  We didn't invite people over to our houses.
[1110.08 --> 1111.08]  We never invited people to church.
[1111.24 --> 1112.88]  It just never got brought up.
[1112.88 --> 1114.72]  Matthew 28, they sort of,
[1114.80 --> 1116.96]  as you go, make disciples, teach them.
[1117.06 --> 1118.68]  None of that was actually happening in the churches.
[1119.62 --> 1120.90]  And they died.
[1122.10 --> 1125.22]  The Great Commission became a great omission.
[1125.90 --> 1127.66]  There's a sense in which they didn't feel the urgency
[1127.66 --> 1129.58]  or the desire to share the good news
[1129.58 --> 1131.70]  that had changed them with their city,
[1132.08 --> 1134.12]  in their words and in their deeds.
[1134.86 --> 1136.18]  What was sobering about that chapter
[1136.18 --> 1137.38]  in two related points.
[1137.50 --> 1139.48]  Number one, some of these people shared a time
[1139.48 --> 1141.34]  back when, when there was life.
[1141.34 --> 1143.36]  When there was the sharing of the gospel,
[1143.46 --> 1144.92]  when people were being invited to the church,
[1144.98 --> 1145.94]  when the church was growing
[1145.94 --> 1147.50]  and had a sense of vitality.
[1147.82 --> 1149.32]  But somehow along the way,
[1149.36 --> 1150.68]  they lost sight of who they were.
[1151.44 --> 1153.06]  And some of them shared how there was a sense
[1153.06 --> 1154.54]  of getting comfortable.
[1155.50 --> 1156.46]  The seats were full.
[1157.26 --> 1158.62]  The budget was being met.
[1159.30 --> 1160.56]  It looked pretty good.
[1160.82 --> 1163.42]  And people just kind of coasted.
[1163.96 --> 1167.04]  And compound that with sort of getting comfortable
[1167.04 --> 1168.62]  with the Western story.
[1169.30 --> 1171.18]  Having a bit more money as a church.
[1171.28 --> 1173.00]  People, you know, buying the cottage,
[1173.14 --> 1175.06]  getting the boat, building a bigger home,
[1175.18 --> 1177.46]  getting a little more established as Western people
[1177.46 --> 1179.20]  and losing that vision
[1179.20 --> 1182.14]  of being a church set apart
[1182.14 --> 1184.42]  for the sake of Jesus Christ in a city.
[1185.20 --> 1186.76]  They lost their vision.
[1187.48 --> 1189.38]  The Great Commission became the great omission
[1189.38 --> 1191.82]  and it led to churches dying.
[1192.64 --> 1194.94]  It led to churches that were empty.
[1195.54 --> 1197.00]  It led to people finally saying,
[1197.50 --> 1198.52]  we must disband.
[1199.54 --> 1200.50]  It's a sobering story.
[1201.28 --> 1202.78]  And I'll come back to that in just a minute.
[1203.76 --> 1205.46]  The challenge to the church in Sardis,
[1205.52 --> 1207.04]  I think actually has an added element
[1207.04 --> 1208.32]  for us here in Canada.
[1208.62 --> 1210.02]  And the reason I say that
[1210.02 --> 1211.68]  is because not only are we tempted
[1211.68 --> 1214.72]  by the slow trickle into the Western story,
[1214.82 --> 1216.64]  sort of the drip line of the Western narrative
[1216.64 --> 1219.02]  and slowly assimilating over time,
[1219.02 --> 1221.96]  we're also living in a culture
[1221.96 --> 1224.82]  that's obsessed with presentation, right?
[1225.16 --> 1226.14]  You know what I mean by that?
[1226.84 --> 1228.74]  It's, you can have a very broken life,
[1228.80 --> 1230.72]  but as long as your social media profile
[1230.72 --> 1232.38]  presents to people
[1232.38 --> 1233.90]  that you have a very enjoyable,
[1234.14 --> 1236.30]  pleasant, good life, it's okay.
[1237.34 --> 1239.22]  And churches have the same temptation.
[1239.60 --> 1240.48]  It might be a mess,
[1240.58 --> 1242.98]  but as long as the live stream looks good, right?
[1243.26 --> 1244.98]  As long as the worship sounds good,
[1244.98 --> 1246.74]  as long as the pastor has a few clever,
[1246.96 --> 1247.72]  punchy illustrations,
[1247.72 --> 1249.70]  and people seem to feel good about it
[1249.70 --> 1250.74]  and it presents well,
[1250.80 --> 1252.64]  we're okay, right?
[1253.78 --> 1255.00]  And we're kind of like
[1255.00 --> 1256.92]  the black, shiny Nissan Maxima
[1256.92 --> 1260.10]  that no one is looking under the hood.
[1261.70 --> 1263.38]  And even pastors fall into this trap.
[1263.48 --> 1264.62]  You know, for the last year and a half,
[1264.80 --> 1266.22]  I've met with a lot of different pastors,
[1266.40 --> 1267.18]  both here in Cloverdale,
[1267.58 --> 1269.52]  one of whom is Pastor Chris here at Sunrise,
[1269.70 --> 1271.90]  and also pastors in our own denomination.
[1272.10 --> 1273.64]  We check in once a month
[1273.64 --> 1274.54]  just to see how we're doing.
[1274.54 --> 1276.54]  So much conversation
[1276.54 --> 1277.68]  has been about the pandemic,
[1277.76 --> 1278.46]  as you can expect,
[1278.68 --> 1279.68]  and the live stream,
[1279.76 --> 1280.48]  and how we pivot,
[1280.58 --> 1282.06]  and how we do online worship, etc.
[1282.96 --> 1284.54]  And sometimes we've lost sight
[1284.54 --> 1285.48]  of the centerpieces.
[1286.12 --> 1286.96]  And there's one pastor,
[1287.00 --> 1287.90]  his name is George Keelan,
[1287.94 --> 1288.68]  who's very quiet
[1288.68 --> 1289.60]  in most of these conversations.
[1289.70 --> 1290.40]  And when he speaks,
[1290.44 --> 1291.00]  you know what he says?
[1291.40 --> 1292.38]  His first question to us,
[1293.08 --> 1293.84]  how's your soul?
[1294.86 --> 1295.64]  That's what he asks us.
[1295.64 --> 1296.30]  How's your soul?
[1297.00 --> 1297.96]  And sometimes even pastors
[1297.96 --> 1298.94]  feel uncomfortable with that question.
[1298.98 --> 1300.04]  What do you mean, how's my soul?
[1300.62 --> 1301.72]  We're talking about the live stream.
[1302.34 --> 1302.58]  And he says,
[1302.68 --> 1303.92]  how are you pastoring people?
[1304.60 --> 1305.88]  How are you shepherding your church?
[1306.28 --> 1307.52]  And you know what George's questions do?
[1307.86 --> 1308.90]  They lift the hood.
[1309.48 --> 1310.94]  And you start having real conversations
[1310.94 --> 1311.94]  about where your church is at,
[1312.02 --> 1312.56]  real conversations
[1312.56 --> 1313.96]  about where your own prayer life is at,
[1314.12 --> 1315.42]  and that's what needs to happen.
[1316.16 --> 1317.54]  That's where the church needs to be.
[1318.40 --> 1320.72]  We live in a presentation-obsessed culture,
[1321.08 --> 1323.12]  and we can be so preoccupied
[1323.12 --> 1323.98]  with how we're presenting
[1323.98 --> 1325.06]  and not attentive
[1325.06 --> 1326.50]  to what's going on under the hood.
[1326.98 --> 1327.96]  And we need to be,
[1328.12 --> 1328.96]  as a local church,
[1329.02 --> 1329.60]  as our church,
[1329.96 --> 1330.98]  attentive to that.
[1332.58 --> 1334.20]  So what does Jesus say
[1334.20 --> 1336.34]  to this church on the verge of death?
[1337.42 --> 1338.64]  Well, he says some strong words.
[1339.54 --> 1340.08]  He says,
[1340.68 --> 1341.28]  wake up,
[1342.44 --> 1343.98]  strengthen what remains,
[1344.72 --> 1346.52]  remember what you have received
[1346.52 --> 1347.10]  and heard,
[1347.24 --> 1348.12]  hold fast to it,
[1348.16 --> 1349.78]  and repent.
[1350.78 --> 1352.04]  That's Jesus' word to Sardis.
[1353.06 --> 1354.14]  And it's also, by extension,
[1354.26 --> 1355.98]  his word to the church in Surrey.
[1356.06 --> 1356.82]  Wake up, church.
[1356.82 --> 1358.64]  Be aware,
[1358.94 --> 1361.42]  be alert to your spiritual lethargy
[1361.42 --> 1362.26]  in the city.
[1363.04 --> 1364.24]  See how you've been slowly
[1364.24 --> 1365.30]  lulled to sleep
[1365.30 --> 1366.34]  in your cultural narrative.
[1366.52 --> 1368.20]  Wake up to who you are
[1368.20 --> 1369.08]  and whose you are
[1369.08 --> 1370.48]  and why you exist.
[1372.30 --> 1373.46]  Strengthen what remains.
[1373.70 --> 1374.74]  And there's hope here, by the way.
[1375.16 --> 1376.16]  Strengthen what remains means
[1376.16 --> 1377.32]  there are some people in the church
[1377.32 --> 1378.48]  who haven't lost sight
[1378.48 --> 1379.64]  of what it means to be the church.
[1380.08 --> 1380.82]  There's a faithful remnant
[1381.46 --> 1382.60]  in the church of Sardis
[1382.60 --> 1384.14]  that is still ready
[1384.14 --> 1386.28]  to pick up the mission in the city.
[1386.28 --> 1388.12]  They're ready to get on board
[1388.12 --> 1389.36]  with what Jesus is calling
[1389.36 --> 1391.70]  to be, to do, and to say.
[1392.76 --> 1393.72]  Strengthen what remains.
[1394.02 --> 1394.74]  Do the stuff
[1394.74 --> 1396.08]  that you had originally envisioned for
[1396.08 --> 1396.96]  when you started gathering
[1396.96 --> 1397.54]  as a church.
[1398.08 --> 1399.14]  Strengthen what remains.
[1400.08 --> 1400.76]  And then remember.
[1402.40 --> 1403.46]  The word remember
[1403.46 --> 1404.58]  is a powerful word
[1404.58 --> 1405.08]  in the scriptures.
[1406.44 --> 1407.50]  In fact, throughout the Old
[1407.50 --> 1408.44]  and the New Testament,
[1408.68 --> 1410.18]  you see God saying to his people,
[1410.84 --> 1411.20]  remember.
[1411.60 --> 1412.20]  In the Old Testament,
[1412.34 --> 1412.64]  God says,
[1412.92 --> 1414.52]  remember who I am.
[1415.14 --> 1416.00]  Remember the name
[1416.00 --> 1416.74]  I revealed to you
[1416.74 --> 1417.32]  about what I've done.
[1417.42 --> 1418.76]  Remember what I've accomplished
[1418.76 --> 1419.34]  for you.
[1419.34 --> 1420.54]  Remember what I've accomplished
[1420.54 --> 1421.44]  for you.
[1439.84 --> 1440.62]  Is this on?
[1440.62 --> 1441.54]  All right.
[1443.32 --> 1444.98]  Oh, the joys of outdoor worship
[1444.98 --> 1447.60]  sure beats being by ourselves
[1447.60 --> 1448.26]  in the sanctuary.
[1449.74 --> 1450.86]  Jesus' word to the church
[1450.86 --> 1451.36]  is remember.
[1452.08 --> 1453.12]  And what does he say?
[1457.12 --> 1459.30]  Remember what you have received
[1459.30 --> 1460.44]  and what you've heard.
[1460.60 --> 1462.22]  Hold fast to it
[1462.22 --> 1463.72]  and repent.
[1465.50 --> 1467.50]  Jesus is doing nothing less
[1467.50 --> 1468.82]  than telling the church
[1468.82 --> 1468.84]  than telling the church
[1468.84 --> 1469.40]  to remember
[1469.40 --> 1470.60]  why they gathered
[1470.60 --> 1471.52]  in the first place.
[1472.04 --> 1472.88]  He's telling them
[1472.88 --> 1473.34]  to remember
[1473.34 --> 1474.46]  what brought them together
[1474.46 --> 1475.14]  as a community
[1475.14 --> 1476.24]  in the very first place.
[1476.26 --> 1476.84]  And what is it?
[1477.40 --> 1478.40]  What drew them together
[1478.40 --> 1479.12]  in the first place?
[1481.84 --> 1482.72]  It's the gospel.
[1482.88 --> 1483.32]  Thank you.
[1484.28 --> 1485.52]  What brought them together
[1485.52 --> 1486.16]  as a community
[1486.16 --> 1487.32]  was not just
[1487.32 --> 1488.28]  an inspirational leader.
[1488.38 --> 1489.16]  It wasn't just a talk.
[1489.20 --> 1489.64]  It was hearing
[1489.64 --> 1490.92]  the power of the gospel,
[1491.04 --> 1492.20]  that glorious story
[1492.20 --> 1493.02]  of God
[1493.02 --> 1493.92]  who is creator of all
[1493.92 --> 1495.02]  sending his son
[1495.02 --> 1495.74]  into his world
[1495.74 --> 1496.78]  to erase
[1496.78 --> 1497.72]  and repeal
[1497.72 --> 1498.74]  the power of sin
[1498.74 --> 1499.38]  over the world
[1499.38 --> 1500.22]  and over his people.
[1500.62 --> 1501.40]  The same Jesus
[1501.40 --> 1502.02]  who defeated
[1502.02 --> 1502.68]  the power of death
[1502.68 --> 1503.66]  rose from the grave,
[1504.04 --> 1504.88]  poured out his spirit
[1504.88 --> 1505.46]  and that spirit
[1505.46 --> 1506.52]  brought transformation
[1506.52 --> 1508.34]  to the church.
[1509.38 --> 1510.46]  Remember, Sardis,
[1510.72 --> 1511.98]  what the gospel did
[1511.98 --> 1512.76]  when you heard it
[1512.76 --> 1513.72]  and you received it.
[1514.04 --> 1515.06]  Remember how it resonated
[1515.06 --> 1515.94]  with the deepest parts
[1515.94 --> 1516.58]  of who you are
[1516.58 --> 1517.86]  and who you are created to be.
[1518.38 --> 1519.76]  Don't forget.
[1521.16 --> 1521.60]  Remember.
[1522.74 --> 1524.32]  This is why you're the church.
[1524.32 --> 1526.12]  This is why you've been sent
[1526.12 --> 1526.64]  to Sardis,
[1526.70 --> 1527.38]  the city I love,
[1527.44 --> 1528.54]  so you can share with them
[1528.54 --> 1529.64]  the best news
[1529.64 --> 1530.38]  you've ever heard,
[1530.78 --> 1531.52]  the best news
[1531.52 --> 1532.60]  that's changed your lives.
[1533.06 --> 1534.12]  And hope I want to extend
[1534.12 --> 1535.14]  that to us this morning,
[1535.38 --> 1536.34]  this afternoon.
[1537.36 --> 1537.78]  Remember.
[1539.82 --> 1541.14]  Remember what brought you
[1541.14 --> 1541.98]  to church.
[1543.34 --> 1544.54]  Remember the story
[1544.54 --> 1545.36]  of the gospel
[1545.36 --> 1546.78]  changing your life.
[1547.98 --> 1549.16]  Remember how it resonated
[1549.16 --> 1550.10]  with the deepest parts
[1550.10 --> 1550.70]  of your being
[1550.70 --> 1552.82]  and how you experienced
[1552.82 --> 1554.32]  the life-changing power
[1554.32 --> 1554.92]  of the gospel
[1554.92 --> 1556.40]  in your own life.
[1557.78 --> 1558.84]  Don't forget.
[1559.82 --> 1561.32]  Don't be lulled to sleep
[1561.32 --> 1562.50]  by a cultural narrative
[1562.50 --> 1563.50]  that is obsessed
[1563.50 --> 1564.32]  with status,
[1564.78 --> 1565.92]  obsessed with presentation,
[1566.14 --> 1567.08]  obsessed with wealth,
[1567.44 --> 1568.34]  obsessed with travel.
[1569.22 --> 1570.30]  Remember who you are.
[1571.18 --> 1572.22]  Remember what happens
[1572.22 --> 1573.54]  to you when you were baptized
[1573.54 --> 1575.84]  into the body of Christ.
[1576.56 --> 1577.38]  You, church,
[1577.44 --> 1578.46]  are the new creation.
[1578.66 --> 1579.78]  Remember that.
[1579.78 --> 1583.46]  You can say amen
[1583.46 --> 1584.90]  while I try to find my page.
[1595.46 --> 1596.46]  Jesus finishes
[1596.46 --> 1599.14]  with some encouraging words
[1599.14 --> 1599.92]  to the church.
[1600.42 --> 1602.48]  I want to read you them now.
[1602.94 --> 1604.26]  I lost my page again.
[1604.26 --> 1610.30]  This is how this letter finishes.
[1610.58 --> 1611.34]  I do want you to hear
[1611.34 --> 1611.90]  the encouragement
[1611.90 --> 1612.64]  built in here.
[1613.40 --> 1613.68]  It says,
[1613.76 --> 1614.62]  You have a few people
[1614.62 --> 1615.08]  in Sardis
[1615.08 --> 1615.98]  who have not soiled
[1615.98 --> 1616.54]  their clothes.
[1617.04 --> 1618.52]  They will walk with me
[1618.52 --> 1619.90]  dressed in white
[1619.90 --> 1621.76]  for they are worthy.
[1622.52 --> 1623.70]  The one who is victorious
[1623.70 --> 1624.72]  will, like them,
[1624.80 --> 1625.80]  be dressed in white.
[1626.34 --> 1627.64]  I will never blot out
[1627.64 --> 1628.10]  their name,
[1628.22 --> 1629.14]  the name of the person
[1629.14 --> 1630.84]  of the book of life,
[1630.84 --> 1631.84]  but will acknowledge
[1631.84 --> 1632.60]  that name
[1632.60 --> 1633.64]  before my Father
[1633.64 --> 1634.56]  and his angels.
[1635.44 --> 1636.44]  Whoever hears,
[1637.20 --> 1638.00]  whoever has ears,
[1638.12 --> 1638.66]  let them hear
[1638.66 --> 1639.70]  what the Spirit says
[1639.70 --> 1640.32]  to the churches.
[1643.30 --> 1644.50]  What Jesus is saying
[1644.50 --> 1644.96]  to the church,
[1645.04 --> 1645.54]  first of all,
[1645.58 --> 1646.20]  is that there is
[1646.20 --> 1647.04]  that faithful remnant.
[1647.16 --> 1647.90]  There are those people
[1647.90 --> 1649.48]  who are not dead,
[1649.88 --> 1651.06]  that they are alive,
[1651.44 --> 1652.32]  and those people,
[1652.38 --> 1652.62]  he says,
[1652.66 --> 1653.30]  when he returns,
[1653.36 --> 1654.46]  they will be clothed in white.
[1654.90 --> 1655.78]  They will be robed
[1655.78 --> 1656.46]  in his purity.
[1656.62 --> 1657.50]  They will walk with him
[1657.50 --> 1658.66]  because they're worthy.
[1659.06 --> 1660.14]  A statement made about Jesus,
[1660.26 --> 1660.98]  the worthy lamb,
[1661.02 --> 1661.68]  is now made about
[1661.68 --> 1663.26]  these faithful followers
[1663.26 --> 1664.88]  who are committed to Christ.
[1665.62 --> 1666.68]  And then Jesus says,
[1667.28 --> 1668.32]  to those who are victorious,
[1668.46 --> 1670.20]  you will be just like them.
[1670.88 --> 1672.76]  To those who are with me,
[1672.90 --> 1674.14]  you will be robed in white,
[1674.20 --> 1675.02]  you will walk with me,
[1675.06 --> 1676.42]  and the word spoken over you
[1676.42 --> 1677.54]  is worthy.
[1677.88 --> 1678.76]  And that's an encouragement
[1678.76 --> 1679.38]  to the church
[1679.38 --> 1680.26]  that has fallen asleep.
[1680.36 --> 1680.66]  He says,
[1680.66 --> 1681.82]  to those who are victorious,
[1681.92 --> 1682.64]  to those who repent,
[1682.90 --> 1683.92]  to those who have ears to hear,
[1684.16 --> 1685.50]  you will walk with me.
[1686.10 --> 1687.50]  You will be considered worthy.
[1688.26 --> 1689.10]  And the difference,
[1689.48 --> 1690.34]  commentators say,
[1690.34 --> 1691.18]  between those who have
[1691.18 --> 1691.96]  soiled their clothes,
[1692.06 --> 1693.10]  a very strong image,
[1693.18 --> 1693.64]  by the way,
[1694.00 --> 1694.52]  of being,
[1694.80 --> 1696.14]  collapsing to the culture,
[1696.24 --> 1696.70]  idolatry,
[1696.80 --> 1697.50]  living in sin,
[1697.68 --> 1698.64]  those who have soiled their clothes,
[1698.70 --> 1699.46]  and those who are wearing
[1699.46 --> 1700.36]  robes of white
[1700.36 --> 1701.00]  and who are pure.
[1701.08 --> 1701.96]  You know what the difference is?
[1703.84 --> 1704.16]  Faithfulness.
[1705.30 --> 1706.38]  Or as one writer put it,
[1706.40 --> 1707.10]  the difference is,
[1707.66 --> 1708.68]  costly witness.
[1710.08 --> 1711.28]  Being loyal to the gospel,
[1711.40 --> 1712.38]  even when it's not easy.
[1713.32 --> 1714.22]  Being loyal to the gospel,
[1714.30 --> 1715.40]  not only when there's persecution
[1715.40 --> 1716.24]  or pressure,
[1716.24 --> 1717.96]  but when there is a very
[1717.96 --> 1719.28]  subversive,
[1719.84 --> 1720.34]  tempting,
[1720.66 --> 1721.36]  cultural narrative
[1721.36 --> 1722.26]  that pulls you away
[1722.26 --> 1722.86]  from Christ.
[1723.80 --> 1724.52]  The difference between
[1724.52 --> 1725.16]  those who have soiled
[1725.16 --> 1725.50]  their clothes
[1725.50 --> 1726.14]  and those who are
[1726.14 --> 1727.12]  considered worthy
[1727.12 --> 1728.64]  is costly witness.
[1729.58 --> 1730.34]  And that's not done
[1730.34 --> 1731.02]  in our own strength.
[1731.08 --> 1731.80]  Don't hear me saying that
[1731.80 --> 1732.32]  for a second.
[1732.70 --> 1734.00]  It's done in the power of Christ.
[1734.08 --> 1734.72]  It's done by the work
[1734.72 --> 1735.20]  of the Spirit.
[1735.46 --> 1736.50]  But it is also a church
[1736.50 --> 1737.60]  that steps forward
[1737.60 --> 1739.58]  and lives faithfully
[1739.58 --> 1740.14]  as a result.
[1740.70 --> 1741.56]  There's work to be done
[1741.56 --> 1742.52]  for the church in Sardis
[1742.52 --> 1743.40]  and there's work to be done
[1743.40 --> 1744.44]  in the church in Surrey.
[1746.24 --> 1748.22]  I think my favorite part
[1748.22 --> 1748.90]  of this passage
[1748.90 --> 1750.70]  is Jesus saying,
[1751.10 --> 1752.00]  when I return in glory
[1752.00 --> 1752.52]  and power,
[1752.64 --> 1753.56]  those who are victorious,
[1753.72 --> 1754.60]  those who are dressed in white,
[1754.88 --> 1756.26]  I will confess their names.
[1756.44 --> 1758.12]  I will acknowledge their names
[1758.12 --> 1759.26]  before my Father
[1759.26 --> 1759.92]  and His angels.
[1760.76 --> 1762.28]  I will speak their names
[1762.28 --> 1763.14]  and they will live
[1763.14 --> 1765.10]  in my new world forever.
[1767.00 --> 1768.00]  I just want to say
[1768.00 --> 1768.76]  that that's my prayer
[1768.76 --> 1769.24]  for me
[1769.24 --> 1771.08]  and for my family
[1771.08 --> 1772.70]  and hope that has been
[1772.70 --> 1773.62]  my prayer for you.
[1774.84 --> 1775.72]  My prayer is that
[1775.72 --> 1776.58]  at the end of all things
[1776.58 --> 1777.36]  when Jesus returns
[1777.36 --> 1778.26]  at glory and power,
[1778.38 --> 1779.46]  our names will be spoken
[1779.46 --> 1780.92]  by Jesus to His Father
[1780.92 --> 1782.42]  and to His angels
[1782.42 --> 1784.62]  and that we will walk
[1784.62 --> 1786.34]  in robes of white
[1786.34 --> 1789.02]  and have the word worthy
[1789.02 --> 1790.98]  describing us as a church.
[1792.26 --> 1793.22]  That's my prayer.
[1795.12 --> 1795.52]  Jesus,
[1795.84 --> 1797.28]  with this church in Sardis,
[1797.88 --> 1799.42]  is ready to bring about
[1799.42 --> 1800.12]  that transformation.
[1801.04 --> 1802.88]  He's ready to work with them,
[1803.28 --> 1803.94]  renew them,
[1803.94 --> 1805.00]  empower them,
[1805.08 --> 1806.22]  and send them into His city.
[1806.28 --> 1807.64]  He's ready to revitalize
[1807.64 --> 1808.30]  that church.
[1809.76 --> 1811.34]  Their task is to repent,
[1812.04 --> 1814.14]  to hold fast,
[1814.28 --> 1815.24]  to remember,
[1815.80 --> 1818.50]  and to listen to the voice
[1818.50 --> 1818.98]  of Jesus.
[1821.36 --> 1822.12]  What I want to do
[1822.12 --> 1823.00]  at this point of the service
[1823.00 --> 1824.00]  is I want to leave some time
[1824.00 --> 1824.82]  for us just to pray.
[1824.82 --> 1827.54]  I want you to spend some time
[1827.54 --> 1828.46]  just quietly praying
[1828.46 --> 1829.84]  for your family,
[1830.14 --> 1831.68]  for our church,
[1832.10 --> 1833.44]  that we would have ears
[1833.44 --> 1835.14]  to hear what we need
[1835.14 --> 1836.26]  to hear in our context
[1836.26 --> 1837.48]  in the West,
[1838.18 --> 1839.24]  and that we would have
[1839.24 --> 1840.86]  our eyes open
[1840.86 --> 1842.86]  to who we are
[1842.86 --> 1844.18]  and what we are called
[1844.18 --> 1845.28]  to be in our own city.
[1845.36 --> 1845.98]  Does that sound good?
[1846.38 --> 1847.02]  I'm going to leave
[1847.02 --> 1847.72]  a time of silence
[1847.72 --> 1848.42]  where you can pray,
[1848.54 --> 1849.24]  and I will close
[1849.24 --> 1850.06]  that time of prayer
[1850.06 --> 1850.86]  for us.
[1850.90 --> 1851.30]  Let's pray.
[1851.30 --> 1851.34]  Let's pray.
[1851.34 --> 1851.38]  Let's pray.
[1851.38 --> 1851.40]  Let's pray.
[1851.40 --> 1851.44]  Let's pray.
[1854.82 --> 1884.80]  Let's pray.
