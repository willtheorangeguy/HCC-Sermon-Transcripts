[0.00 → 19.12] Good morning. My name is Laura Dieses. I'm a long-time member of Hope Community Church.
[19.74 → 25.14] I've known Sid Vander wood and Candy since 1980, so just a few years.
[25.14 → 38.22] Sid and I taught at John Knox Christian School together, and I remember him walking down the hallway at school one day with his baby face, his sweet grin and his goofy disposition.
[39.26 → 46.56] He was mistaken for one of the students. These qualities of his are not something that have changed a lot.
[46.56 → 56.42] Sid was part of a group of people who got together in the Lower Mainland to start an outreach church for the Surrey area.
[57.14 → 67.22] And Sid and Candy and I were part of the group that made the 2,000 phone calls to get people interested in our church and to let them know about our first service.
[67.22 → 78.82] Still, we were the gym church for many more years after that. But now I sit here in this beautiful building, this church that I call home.
[79.44 → 83.98] And it has far exceeded what my imagination had imagined the church would be like.
[83.98 → 94.98] I have had the opportunity to not only watch the growth of this church I call home, but I've had the privilege of watching Sid and Candy grow.
[95.70 → 104.08] Sid from that baby face, competitive, talkative youngster into the incredible mature man of faith that he is today.
[104.08 → 114.22] Now, it's no secret that behind a successful man, there is also a successful woman or a good woman. Candy is exceptional.
[115.22 → 126.28] I've always been in awe of Candy, how kind and how driven she is and how her smile lights up a room and everybody there feels seen.
[127.28 → 130.44] And don't even get me started on her boulder cook.
[130.44 → 134.64] Sid and Candy have been part of Hope from the beginning.
[135.22 → 144.90] And I consider it a privilege, an honour, that we have, in a sense, grown up together here in the church and in each other's lives.
[146.86 → 152.74] And here we are at another change, another momentous moment in our lives.
[153.70 → 159.20] Sid, honestly, Sid, you are one of the best preachers that I have ever heard, and I've heard of you.
[159.20 → 164.82] I am proud of the man you've become, Sid, and I'm blessed to call you and Candy friends.
[165.38 → 167.54] I wish you a great retirement.
[168.34 → 171.94] God bless you and keep you in this new chapter of your life.
[173.02 → 176.08] And I just wondered, Candy, are you retiring too?
[176.84 → 177.48] Thank you.
[177.48 → 181.50] My name is Chuck Gerber.
[182.76 → 186.78] Pastor Sid would be about 40 years ago when we first met.
[187.82 → 198.28] That was when John Knox Christian hired this young, energetic, and probably a bit cocky fellow straight out of Kelvin College to be our grade 6 teacher.
[199.56 → 202.58] You taught all but one of our children.
[202.58 → 211.82] Our daughter, Yvonne, very much wanted to be in your class after hearing the stories from her brothers about your great jokes and storytelling.
[212.80 → 215.30] However, she was put into a different class.
[216.22 → 218.92] She talks about her disappointment to this day.
[219.92 → 228.58] You continued at John Knox for many years as teacher, as vice principal, and as part-time teacher of Bible until quite recently.
[228.58 → 239.54] Any of us who have ever played any sports with or especially against you know a bit of how competitive you really are.
[240.30 → 242.60] You will give all your all to win.
[243.30 → 248.98] I experienced your drive to win firsthand playing hockey, tennis, and pickleball.
[249.72 → 251.76] You will play until you nearly drop.
[251.76 → 260.20] That competitive streak and drive to succeed has stood you in good stead in your life as well as in your ministry.
[261.28 → 273.28] Sid, your love for God and all his children has enabled you to preach that message of salvation and grace for many years every Sunday again and again.
[274.14 → 277.70] You had the privilege of administering the sacraments.
[277.70 → 283.48] You visited the sick as well as the healthy members of the congregation.
[284.20 → 286.68] You welcomed people to your home.
[287.74 → 296.50] You taught and baptized the young and the old, even in backyard hot tubs and in the fridge of water of Crescent Beach.
[297.26 → 301.94] You married couples and officiated at funerals and memorial services.
[302.70 → 306.08] You have empathy and love for all who cross your path.
[306.08 → 310.40] You're a natural at seeking out people who come for the first time.
[311.02 → 313.28] You talk to them and give them a listening ear.
[314.02 → 321.82] You welcome and accept us all as we are, broken and in need of care, and above all, in need of God's love.
[323.26 → 327.64] Sid, you are a passionate preacher, often using examples from your own life.
[328.14 → 330.68] It really relates to our lives.
[330.68 → 337.30] But when you preach, you freely use your hands and arms in support of the spoken word.
[338.56 → 349.32] Did you know that in an experiment that I read about recently, is that when a person's hands were tied down, that person had difficulty expressing himself?
[350.70 → 354.72] Sid, I hope for Candy's sake that you do not talk in your sleep.
[354.72 → 362.74] 25 years as a pastor, serving in this church, in the one church, is no mean feat.
[363.38 → 365.56] Many pastors never reach that milestone.
[366.68 → 370.48] You have gone through difficult times and good times.
[370.48 → 384.38] But I believe that your competitive spirit, your love for God and people, and the love that people have shown you, has carried you through all these years.
[385.04 → 391.54] And I would be amiss if I did not mention this one most important person in your life, Candy.
[392.12 → 394.44] She has stood beside you and with you.
[394.94 → 397.90] She prayed with and for you and for this church.
[397.90 → 406.38] And I am sure she was not afraid to lovingly criticize you whenever you needed it.
[407.16 → 413.42] You and Candy are a team invaluable to this church and have been from day one.
[415.20 → 419.02] A few days ago, you celebrated your 65th birthday.
[419.66 → 424.60] Today, we celebrate 25 years in the ministry and service to hope.
[424.60 → 434.54] You are passing the torch of senior pastor you have held so well for so long to your trusted friend and colleague, David Run.
[435.56 → 441.68] Sid, thank you for being a friend of the family and a pastor to us as well.
[441.68 → 447.42] And personally, I have always appreciated your visit when I was awaiting surgery.
[448.42 → 449.74] You did well, my friend.
[450.40 → 455.42] May God continue to bless you and your family and Candy in the ministry.
[456.20 → 458.00] See you back after the summer.
[458.54 → 459.16] I love you.
[459.16 → 460.16] Hi.
[460.16 → 469.44] For those of you who do not know me, my name is Linda Watkins, and I've been a member at Hope since 1989.
[471.02 → 481.42] I'm happy to be here today to share with you some stories about Sid, his time in ministry, and the impact that him and Candy have had on my life.
[481.42 → 487.08] We met in 1988 when Hope first opened its doors.
[487.80 → 496.58] Sid and Candy were part of the founding group of 10 families that had a vision for a community outreach church here.
[498.02 → 508.84] Pastor Steve Ending challenged this group that they would need to give up some current friendships in order to have time for new friendships with unchurched friends.
[508.84 → 513.66] So that they could build community and share their faith.
[514.70 → 525.62] Kevin and I are so thankful that Sid and Candy connected with us and our children, helping us to grow spiritually, serving in the church, and doing life together.
[526.94 → 533.50] Back before Sid became a pastor, he would occasionally help out and give the Sunday message.
[534.20 → 536.88] At the time, I was the church secretary.
[536.88 → 541.30] I remember the first time he sent me his outline.
[542.30 → 548.08] We used to have a fill-in-the-blank message outline that was a half page.
[549.56 → 552.24] Sid's outline filled four pages.
[553.64 → 558.02] I think he was so excited to be speaking and had a lot to share.
[558.38 → 562.68] There was enough material there for three sermons all rolled into one.
[563.88 → 565.26] Nothing has changed.
[565.26 → 570.88] Seriously, Sid, we love your passion and enjoy your messages.
[572.54 → 580.32] When Sid and Candy took over the leadership of Hope, we were blessed with their commitment to stay true to God's vision for this church.
[580.90 → 586.26] The road had its ups and downs, and unfortunately, a lot of us were burnt out.
[586.26 → 591.88] Sid and Candy were faithful to God's calling and persevered through the struggles.
[592.54 → 600.04] That's when I saw a real strength in their faithfulness and dedication to God and the love for their community.
[601.54 → 603.96] Sid and Candy have been my faith warriors.
[603.96 → 612.36] We've been through a lot together, and I'm thankful to know they're walking alongside me to mentor, encourage, and pray.
[613.32 → 617.92] God has given me a blessing with your friendships, and I am beyond thankful.
[617.92 → 626.82] Congratulations to you both for 25, but really 34 years of ministry at Hope.
[627.60 → 631.84] And wow, I can't believe my tennis partner is going to be 65 years young.
[632.36 → 633.52] Happy birthday, Sid.
[634.38 → 638.86] God's blessings to you both as you continue to bless others.
[638.86 → 639.98] And I love you.
[652.46 → 653.42] Good morning, Sid.
[653.72 → 657.76] We remember 25 years ago when you and Candy took on pastoral leadership here at Hope.
[658.10 → 659.68] What an amazing adventure it's been.
[660.50 → 664.72] Sid, your friendship and spiritual guidance has been invaluable to us and our family.
[664.72 → 671.90] We thank God daily for putting you and Candy in our lives, and we wish you many blessings in the years ahead.
[672.62 → 673.36] Hi, Pastor Sid.
[673.50 → 674.88] This is how we describe you.
[675.36 → 679.94] Sincere, servant heart, humble.
[681.30 → 685.26] Passionate, selfless, and honest.
[686.52 → 687.50] Enjoy your break.
[688.12 → 688.74] We'll miss you.
[688.74 → 689.04] Thank you.
[689.04 → 689.34] Thank you.
[689.34 → 689.36] Thank you.
[689.36 → 689.74] Thank you.
[689.74 → 696.64] Sid, you have led our congregation in humble, vulnerable introspection.
[697.48 → 704.02] Your sermons had the special quality of taking us to humble, vulnerable introspection as well.
[704.44 → 704.94] Thank you.
[705.58 → 706.44] Hi, Sid and Candy.
[706.86 → 711.60] I want to thank you for your dedication, your love for community,
[711.60 → 719.14] and for inspiring so many people that have come through these doors at Hope Community Church.
[720.24 → 725.70] I want to personally thank you for always being there for me and always giving me a listening ear.
[726.12 → 729.50] Sid, we want to tell you how much we appreciate how you welcomed us into Hope,
[729.94 → 734.20] your passionate discipleship of us, and that we consider you a friend.
[734.92 → 737.62] I'm just glad we didn't have to use the paddles on you during your sermon.
[737.62 → 742.64] Sid, I love how generous you are in the face of complex topics,
[742.76 → 746.80] which may be hotly contested by equally passionate and genuine people,
[747.18 → 750.94] and how your honest vulnerability and servant leadership shines
[750.94 → 754.92] as you willingly walk alongside us in our joys and sorrows.
[756.06 → 758.64] Sid, so many things we appreciate about you.
[759.00 → 762.76] Sid, you are warm, inviting, you're passionate about preaching,
[762.76 → 767.96] you're humble and relatable, and you make every effort to get to know everyone.
[769.20 → 773.72] Thanks, Sid, for all of your years of dedication to all of us at Hope.
[774.08 → 779.90] We at CCC, truly Caribou Community Church, that is, truly values your insight, guidance,
[780.04 → 783.50] and availability to walk alongside over these many years,
[783.74 → 787.14] and we have benefited richly from your investment.
[787.14 → 790.72] And thank you for your partnership in the kingdom work,
[791.08 → 794.50] and you are an indispensable part of the work here.
[794.98 → 796.44] Blessings, brother, and take care.
[796.96 → 800.92] Congratulations, Sid and Candy, on your 25 years of service.
[801.42 → 806.62] You have loved us, you never judged us, and always led us to Christ.
[807.16 → 808.60] We are forever grateful.
[808.60 → 813.16] Hi, Sid. Happy birthday from this side of Fraser Highway.
[813.54 → 818.08] I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for your amazing contribution to Coverdale.
[818.76 → 822.32] You've been a great inspiration, and I've enjoyed working with you over the years.
[822.64 → 826.86] Sid and Candy, we want to tell you how much we cherish your friendship over the years,
[827.06 → 831.62] and we've appreciated your ministering to us ever since we started going to church,
[831.78 → 833.52] way back in the early 90s.
[833.74 → 834.50] We love you both.
[834.50 → 843.94] Well, Sid, 30 years I've known you, and you have been such a support and such a blessing to me all these years.
[844.44 → 847.60] You've been with us through the good times and the bad times,
[847.80 → 851.10] and we love you and appreciate you so much.
[851.42 → 851.96] Thank you.
[852.22 → 857.50] Pastor Sid, I just want to thank you for being our family pastor for so many years.
[857.78 → 864.36] We love you, Candy, and thank you for being such an encouragement in our life.
[864.50 → 865.50] Thanks.
[865.50 → 866.02] Thanks.
[868.18 → 877.74] I want to celebrate you, Sid, because you are one of my friends who I could say define what perseverance is all about.
[878.26 → 884.54] You jumped into things when things were changing, and you shouldered on for years in ministry.
[884.54 → 894.34] At times, not sure where this would go, but now to see such a flourish of energy and love and opportunity.
[895.22 → 900.78] So thank you for being a friend, but a very good and persevering one.
[901.16 → 905.46] Sid, always appreciated the inspiration and the twisted sense of humour.
[906.02 → 906.38] Wonderful.
[906.72 → 907.14] Thank you.
[907.14 → 911.04] And thanks for helping us grow spiritually, Sid.
[911.66 → 912.36] Hi, Sid.
[912.82 → 916.24] You made our family feel so welcome from the minute we walked through the doors at Hope,
[916.58 → 923.76] and I've come to understand over the past couple of years that that warm, generous, caring person is exactly who you always are.
[923.76 → 928.68] Thank you, and congratulations on 25 years at Hope Community Church.
[929.44 → 930.06] Hi, Sid.
[930.42 → 934.98] We'd just like to thank you for all your years of service and dedication to the community.
[935.86 → 944.24] What I love about you most is your authentic leadership and your willingness to share your struggles and your own personal faults.
[944.24 → 945.24] Wow, Sid.
[946.62 → 947.18] Congratulations.
[947.56 → 957.60] This is a huge milestone for you, and you've been part of our lives for the last 25 years, and been along the journey with us and our family.
[958.06 → 964.90] We love you so much, and we wish you well, and enjoy this next chapter in your life.
[967.02 → 972.30] Thanks, Pastor Sid, for always being down to earth and encouraging us to stay on the right trail.
[972.30 → 976.04] Thank you for providing a stable place for our families.
[976.74 → 977.48] Thank you.
[978.26 → 980.38] Thank you, Pastor Ken.
[981.38 → 982.72] Hi, Sid and Candy.
[983.32 → 989.76] What we really love about you and appreciate about you is the love that you bring and share to us at Hope.
[990.28 → 990.84] Thanks.
[993.36 → 996.16] Happy birthday to you.
[996.50 → 999.10] Happy birthday to you.
[999.54 → 1001.96] Happy birthday, dear Sid.
[1002.30 → 1005.46] Happy birthday to you.
[1006.74 → 1012.56] The two of you as you've served, you've served in humility, and humility is a place of honour in the kingdom.
[1013.08 → 1015.70] So God bless you as you celebrate and enter into this next phase.
[1016.04 → 1017.70] Love you so much from all of us at sunrise.
[1017.70 → 1024.66] So we thank you, Sid, for always making us feel welcome, and for the love that you've shown us.
[1024.94 → 1030.60] We love both you and Candy so much and wish you guys all the best and all the blessings.
[1031.14 → 1032.86] Congratulations, Pastor Sid.
[1032.96 → 1034.74] Retirement has finally come.
[1034.74 → 1043.20] Thank you very much for providing me a strong foundation to my faith by listening to your services every Sunday.
[1043.90 → 1044.36] Congratulations.
[1044.36 → 1059.54] You're comfortable with an amount of uncertainty, and you have an openness to not knowing that I personally deeply appreciate because I feel like it gives me permission to grapple with my own faith.
[1059.54 → 1064.48] You're a good man, and you have an even better woman by your side.
[1064.48 → 1074.24] I just wanted to say thank you for making yourself available to God, to be his instrument, to speak to me and to others for these many years.
[1074.58 → 1083.14] I want to wish you every blessing as you continue to serve him moving forward, and thank you for your many faithful years of service today.
[1084.00 → 1085.58] Happy retirement, Sid.
[1085.84 → 1087.02] Happy retirement, Sid.
[1087.02 → 1087.96] We're going to miss you.
[1088.22 → 1093.64] We're going to miss your awesome sermons that you have done over the years and the humour that you put into it.
[1093.68 → 1095.46] We really sincerely appreciate that.
[1095.74 → 1099.88] We appreciate you for your part in helping us raise our kids, too.
[1100.30 → 1100.86] Love you.
[1100.96 → 1101.48] All the best.
[1101.58 → 1102.18] Happy retirement.
[1103.28 → 1111.80] Wishing Sid a very happy birthday and thanking him and Candy for 25 years of dedicated service to the church.
[1111.98 → 1113.26] It's meant a lot to our family.
[1113.26 → 1121.32] Sid, I am privileged to have had your support during particularly difficult passages in my life and to celebrate life's joys.
[1121.82 → 1128.72] I am honoured to be able to call you a friend and pastor and look forward to when we can again meet face to raise a glass and celebrate you.
[1129.40 → 1131.22] Happy 65th birthday, Sid.
[1131.62 → 1138.96] I thank you for your 25 years of service at Hope Community Church, and I also thank you for the passion you have to spread the love of God.
[1139.26 → 1141.16] You have impacted my life in many ways.
[1143.26 → 1154.56] Pastor Sid, we just wanted to say what an incredible blessing you and Candy have been to Wendy and me, as we've shared these last four and a half years as members of your congregation.
[1155.70 → 1159.54] Congratulations, Sid and Candy, 25 years.
[1159.54 → 1163.84] We love your passion when you preach.
[1163.96 → 1169.54] We love your wisdom and that you're just real, down to earth, and so approachable.
[1170.54 → 1177.58] Many blessings to you, Sid and Candy, as you look at retirement and look forward to many years yet together.
[1178.24 → 1178.76] Hey, Sid.
[1179.28 → 1180.00] Happy birthday.
[1180.00 → 1184.46] Happy birthday, and congratulations on a semi-retirement.
[1186.16 → 1194.58] Yeah, and I thank you for what you have done for this church and allowing me to be here and being an intern where I get to grow as a pastor as well.
[1194.98 → 1195.46] Thank you.
[1195.82 → 1198.78] And Candy, thank you so much for your love.
[1199.26 → 1203.88] Thank you so much for making us feel so welcome at Hope.
[1203.88 → 1205.26] We love you.
[1206.74 → 1207.46] Hi, Sid.
[1207.78 → 1211.22] Congratulations on your birthday as well as 25 years of service to Hope.
[1211.54 → 1218.30] But before you were at Hope, you actually had an impact in my life while I was still a young girl at John Knox Christian School.
[1218.52 → 1222.66] So thank you for the impact that you've had on me throughout the years, and enjoy your break.
[1223.22 → 1225.24] Sid, I love your sense of humour.
[1225.78 → 1227.88] And of course, that sarcasm too.
[1228.66 → 1231.96] But mostly, you're genuine, down to earth, and deeply care.
[1231.96 → 1235.36] Thank you for 25 years of teachings, prayers, and support.
[1235.88 → 1237.68] You truly are the heart of hope.
[1238.22 → 1240.40] Happy birthday, you wild and crazy guy.
[1240.66 → 1244.48] Appreciate you as our pastor, and we have appreciated you.
[1244.64 → 1245.46] Happy retirement.
[1246.28 → 1248.68] And we commend you for your longevity.
[1249.66 → 1254.20] And yeah, I hope that God will continue to use you for many years.
[1254.78 → 1255.64] God bless you.
[1256.38 → 1258.50] Sid, Candy, thank you.
[1259.04 → 1261.04] For your warmth, wisdom, cantor, and caring.
[1261.04 → 1264.22] Your honesty, humanity, humility, and hilarity.
[1264.88 → 1266.92] Sid, for your latitudinarianism.
[1267.26 → 1269.16] Candy, thanks for your long-suffering.
[1269.80 → 1270.98] You're both Christ-like.
[1271.58 → 1272.48] Have a joie de vivre.
[1273.06 → 1274.36] Thank you so much.
[1274.74 → 1275.44] We love you both.
[1276.02 → 1276.54] Hi, Sid.
[1277.12 → 1279.76] Thank you for all your service to Hope.
[1279.98 → 1282.10] Thank you for your friendship, your guidance.
[1282.10 → 1286.58] And we're really looking forward to kicking your butt and pickle.
[1287.38 → 1287.82] Cheers.
[1288.28 → 1288.60] Cheers.
[1290.12 → 1291.98] Pastor Sid, I love your sense of humour.
[1292.48 → 1294.12] I love that you look out for the little guy.
[1294.78 → 1296.26] And I love that you're a little bit of a rebel.
[1296.88 → 1299.94] Candy, I love that you are no-nonsense.
[1299.94 → 1301.44] So refreshing.
[1301.74 → 1304.40] And at the same time, you are super compassionate.
[1304.68 → 1306.64] And somehow you hold those things together perfectly.
[1307.18 → 1308.30] I love you both.
[1308.78 → 1310.26] And I appreciate you so much.
[1310.26 → 1335.72] Good morning.
[1335.72 → 1335.78] Good morning.
[1335.78 → 1335.84] Good morning.
[1338.22 → 1339.60] I certainly feel humbled.
[1339.90 → 1341.32] A little alive there.
[1342.04 → 1344.40] I certainly feel very humbled by this morning.
[1344.60 → 1349.92] And thank you for all the kind words and the beautiful well-wishes.
[1350.32 → 1358.16] And I feel extremely grateful to be a part of this church for so many years.
[1360.46 → 1363.10] When a church is called the Bride of Christ, you know,
[1363.10 → 1367.64] I think it strikes me, you know, that this is a love relationship.
[1367.88 → 1369.92] And I'm so grateful for all the love I've received.
[1370.46 → 1372.26] And also I've been allowed to share.
[1372.96 → 1374.02] And I praise you.
[1374.22 → 1375.66] And praise the Lord for all that.
[1375.74 → 1380.86] And I thank you for all the kindness that you've shown me and Candy this morning.
[1381.04 → 1382.92] And for all the years that have been here.
[1384.38 → 1388.72] I want to thank Pastor Dave for preaching the last two weeks.
[1388.72 → 1391.64] When I was supposed to preach, I was shed with it.
[1392.48 → 1395.76] I've been struggling with vertigo for the past few weeks.
[1396.08 → 1397.62] And it's been a little bit rough.
[1398.92 → 1400.24] So I'm going for physio.
[1400.92 → 1402.50] I'm trying to get back on track.
[1402.62 → 1404.60] So if you see me wobbling a bit, you know why.
[1405.38 → 1407.96] I turn 65 and I fall apart.
[1408.46 → 1409.36] So, anyway.
[1409.36 → 1413.42] I'd like to get into the message right at this time.
[1413.62 → 1415.94] And I was reading a study.
[1416.26 → 1418.60] And the study examined clergy health.
[1419.48 → 1425.16] And it found that the greatest contributing factor to a pastor's well-being
[1425.16 → 1429.62] is when they are seen by themselves and by their congregations
[1429.62 → 1435.50] as actual human beings with real human needs and limitations.
[1435.50 → 1443.74] In my 25 years of serving this community, I've let you see and let you know that I'm just a human being.
[1445.48 → 1447.10] Some of you expressed that.
[1447.18 → 1449.74] I'm obviously a competitive human being.
[1451.08 → 1452.60] But I'm a needy human being.
[1453.04 → 1453.94] Like you.
[1455.44 → 1457.48] In need of a Saviour.
[1459.42 → 1463.88] One of my favourite verses is John 3, verse 30.
[1465.50 → 1470.50] John the Baptist has had a ministry going on.
[1473.02 → 1476.48] And Jesus comes and John is the forerunner of Jesus.
[1476.76 → 1482.84] And some of John's disciples and followers are a little bit upset
[1482.84 → 1489.90] because Jesus has started his ministry and there's people coming to Jesus and less to John.
[1491.52 → 1494.44] And John, are you okay with that?
[1495.50 → 1499.68] And, you know, it shouldn't be this way.
[1499.74 → 1501.66] We shouldn't be losing popularity.
[1502.88 → 1506.34] And John's response was John 3, verse 30, where he says,
[1507.22 → 1508.50] He, and he points to Jesus,
[1508.76 → 1510.12] He must become greater.
[1510.78 → 1511.92] I must become less.
[1515.52 → 1519.48] You know, I think over the years I've felt that more and more and more.
[1519.48 → 1524.24] He must become greater.
[1524.24 → 1525.24] That's the point.
[1526.04 → 1527.72] He is the Lord.
[1528.40 → 1529.24] Not me.
[1529.48 → 1529.98] Not you.
[1530.16 → 1530.88] Not any of us.
[1531.18 → 1532.90] Jesus is the Messiah.
[1534.14 → 1536.10] And John is saying, I'm not the Messiah.
[1536.32 → 1536.94] He is.
[1537.16 → 1538.54] And I'm pointing to him.
[1538.92 → 1540.32] I know I need him.
[1540.70 → 1541.60] And I need him.
[1541.94 → 1542.76] And you need him.
[1542.76 → 1548.22] And that's why we're here together celebrating that God who recognizes our human limitations
[1548.22 → 1550.96] and comes and saves us anyway.
[1550.96 → 1561.44] In this series of sermons on apprenticing with Jesus, we celebrate Jesus, our Messiah, our Lord.
[1562.10 → 1563.26] One worth following.
[1563.26 → 1573.84] We have talked about trying to live the way of Jesus, the lifestyle of Jesus, so we can reflect who he is in our lives.
[1574.78 → 1577.10] But not as Messiahs.
[1578.42 → 1580.50] That's Jesus' role alone.
[1583.38 → 1585.90] In this series, we've been talking about practices.
[1585.90 → 1597.44] And today I want to talk about the practice of Sabbath, which is, I suppose, kind of ironic since I'm about to begin a sabbatical, which is an extended Sabbath.
[1598.26 → 1601.02] Sabbath is a Hebrew word, Shabbat.
[1601.38 → 1603.08] And really it means to stop.
[1604.24 → 1605.32] Stop working.
[1605.60 → 1606.50] Stop striving.
[1606.74 → 1607.54] Stop worrying.
[1607.80 → 1608.62] Stop escaping.
[1609.04 → 1611.50] Stop being deluded by your own self-images.
[1611.84 → 1612.52] Just stop it.
[1612.52 → 1614.40] You're not the Messiah.
[1615.90 → 1617.94] And I would say, what a relief.
[1619.80 → 1622.48] In Hebrews 4, we read,
[1624.10 → 1628.90] There remains then a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
[1629.96 → 1636.86] For anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their work, just as God did from his.
[1636.86 → 1646.84] Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.
[1647.06 → 1649.36] And he's making a reference there to the people of Israel.
[1649.80 → 1652.62] God had taken them out of the land of Egypt, out of slavery.
[1652.86 → 1654.06] He had brought them through the wilderness.
[1654.54 → 1655.76] They were now at the promised land.
[1655.86 → 1657.90] And then they decided, oh man, it's just too risky.
[1657.90 → 1659.42] We can't trust God on this one.
[1659.60 → 1661.54] That's the disobedience he's talking about there.
[1661.88 → 1668.92] Where they continued to, where they rather chose not to trust God with the task at hand.
[1668.92 → 1678.12] Some of you are in the habit of not resting.
[1680.12 → 1684.88] Which in essence is an expression of not trusting.
[1684.88 → 1690.76] I think there's a profound connection between those two.
[1691.14 → 1693.50] When we look at Exodus 20, verse 8.
[1693.96 → 1695.68] You know, part of the Ten Commandments.
[1695.82 → 1700.84] Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
[1701.66 → 1704.22] And I know there's over the years, there's been lots and lots of discussion.
[1704.30 → 1705.98] When I was a kid, there was all this kind of things.
[1706.18 → 1707.76] What can you do on the Sabbath?
[1707.88 → 1709.10] And it became a bit legalistic.
[1709.10 → 1715.88] But this idea, remember it to keep it holy because it's holy.
[1717.58 → 1720.52] Remember, the Ten Commandments say.
[1721.14 → 1724.32] In Hebrews we read, make every effort.
[1724.74 → 1729.28] Make every effort to remind yourself you're human.
[1729.72 → 1730.90] You're limited.
[1731.50 → 1733.06] You're not the Messiah.
[1733.06 → 1739.74] And the idea of this command is we're told to work hard.
[1739.98 → 1741.90] Work hard to rest well.
[1742.74 → 1744.46] You know, to really put some effort into that.
[1744.70 → 1746.16] It takes intentionality.
[1746.52 → 1748.20] It doesn't just happen.
[1748.46 → 1749.42] It takes planning.
[1749.60 → 1750.74] It takes preparation.
[1751.96 → 1754.12] It takes saying no to good things.
[1754.26 → 1756.78] To say yes to God's best.
[1756.78 → 1766.12] Sabbath is the primary practice by which we cultivate a spirit of restfulness.
[1767.26 → 1777.08] When I look back at 30 years, 30 plus years, you know, I think of the times when I would strive to do all I could.
[1777.20 → 1779.78] But sometimes, and too often in my own strength.
[1779.78 → 1784.78] Or too often with a sense of frantic and frenetic pace.
[1784.78 → 1788.80] If I could do anything over again, I'd learn to rest better.
[1789.96 → 1791.02] So I could work better.
[1791.28 → 1794.04] I think part of that was the burnout I experienced at one time in my life.
[1794.40 → 1796.98] Walter Brueggemann, a great Christian philosopher, said,
[1797.32 → 1800.46] People who keep Sabbath live all seven days differently.
[1802.00 → 1804.24] I think that's amazingly profound.
[1804.56 → 1806.20] You live all seven days differently.
[1806.40 → 1807.94] And you might say, well, how is that possible?
[1808.30 → 1812.58] Because that one day will frame the way you live your life.
[1812.58 → 1814.56] It will frame the whole week.
[1814.78 → 1818.74] It framed Jesus' life.
[1818.88 → 1820.78] Jesus had this weekly routine.
[1820.90 → 1824.18] He often stopped to be with the Father.
[1824.48 → 1825.26] To recalibrate.
[1825.36 → 1826.20] To refocus.
[1827.28 → 1830.16] And Jesus got in trouble with how he kept the Sabbath.
[1831.58 → 1836.26] There was some attack by the religious leaders about how he was keeping Sabbath.
[1836.36 → 1838.66] And this was his response out of Mark 2, verse 27.
[1838.66 → 1843.90] Then he said to them, the Sabbath was made for man.
[1844.22 → 1846.86] Not man for the Sabbath.
[1846.86 → 1858.70] The Jews of Jesus' time, he was saying to them, he was saying, stop all the legalism, all the guilt.
[1859.30 → 1862.10] You're missing the heart of the Father in this.
[1862.10 → 1865.54] I think I grew up with some of that.
[1866.48 → 1868.72] You know, we had church twice on a Sunday.
[1869.22 → 1871.82] But it was often very legalistic.
[1871.92 → 1873.92] And I think we tended to miss the heart of the Father.
[1873.92 → 1881.08] My parents were a little bit different.
[1881.08 → 1884.74] And, you know, we had an afternoon Sunday service.
[1885.24 → 1886.26] This was in Ladder.
[1887.12 → 1889.00] And it was built around farming.
[1889.66 → 1890.26] Dairy farmers.
[1890.64 → 1892.74] And there was a 2.30 service.
[1893.08 → 1895.62] So, basically, you had your morning service.
[1896.02 → 1898.42] And then you went home, and you had coffee and lunch.
[1898.44 → 1899.58] And then we went back to church.
[1900.32 → 1903.46] My parents were what often were called conceders.
[1905.32 → 1909.44] And my parents were a little bit more liberal.
[1910.14 → 1912.66] And they, you know, I was allowed to go play ball hockey.
[1912.72 → 1914.30] Because there are a lot of rules about what you couldn't do.
[1915.00 → 1918.62] We played ball hockey in the local lacrosse box.
[1920.54 → 1925.84] And my parents still told me, listen, that people going to church go around 2 o'clock.
[1925.84 → 1929.08] So, make sure you stop playing ball hockey then.
[1929.22 → 1931.44] Because then they'll drive by, and might see you playing.
[1931.58 → 1936.68] And there was a lot of legalism around that.
[1936.78 → 1941.16] You know, that wasn't the heart of the Father that we were seeking.
[1941.48 → 1943.18] It was kind of rule keeping.
[1945.30 → 1950.46] For the first century Jews, they needed to hear that, you know, this Sabbath.
[1950.96 → 1953.38] It's not manned for the Sabbath, right?
[1953.44 → 1954.74] It's the other way around here.
[1955.84 → 1962.02] But 21st century people today aren't legalistic about Sabbath keeping.
[1963.36 → 1964.70] You talk about Sabbath a day off?
[1964.78 → 1965.66] Yeah, sure, sure.
[1966.38 → 1967.26] Sunday worship?
[1967.42 → 1970.30] Well, when it suits me.
[1971.88 → 1975.60] Yeah, when I can make it work, yeah, then I think I'll be okay with that.
[1976.16 → 1980.92] I read this great quote from A.J. Stood where he says,
[1980.92 → 1988.16] The Sabbath has largely been forgotten by the church,
[1988.16 → 1994.24] which has uncritically mimicked the rhythms of the industrial and success-obsessed West.
[1994.24 → 1995.54] And the result?
[1995.54 → 2005.04] Our road-weary, exhausted churches have largely failed to integrate Sabbath into their lives as vital elements of Christian discipleship.
[2005.04 → 2008.94] It is not as though we do not love God.
[2009.04 → 2010.58] We love God deeply.
[2011.42 → 2015.54] We just do not know how to sit with God anymore.
[2015.54 → 2026.00] We have become perhaps the most emotionally exhausted, psychologically overworked, spiritually malnourished people in history.
[2026.00 → 2034.64] Yet, too many of us, including pastors, don't Sabbath well.
[2036.22 → 2043.30] They don't take the time to stop and reflect and remember who they are before Almighty God.
[2045.90 → 2049.32] I think that act of remembering is more profound than we give it credit.
[2049.32 → 2055.26] You know, we need to hear the Sabbath was made for man.
[2055.36 → 2057.58] This is an act for you.
[2057.90 → 2061.32] This first part is what we need to hear.
[2061.74 → 2066.04] A gift that goes back to the very, very beginning of time,
[2066.18 → 2070.30] where it says, God rested and made the Sabbath holy.
[2072.32 → 2075.54] I think we need to remind ourselves, and we need to hear that well.
[2076.14 → 2077.40] God rested.
[2077.40 → 2080.72] Well, yeah, but you know, I'm not into Sabbath.
[2080.82 → 2082.08] I really need to stay busy.
[2082.74 → 2083.88] God rested.
[2084.10 → 2087.18] Yeah, I know, I know, but I've got a lot going on.
[2087.88 → 2089.14] God rested.
[2091.94 → 2092.68] God rested.
[2095.00 → 2096.20] You're busier than God.
[2098.20 → 2101.02] This is a rhythm that God himself built into creation.
[2101.68 → 2103.76] You know, when we say, well, was God tired, but he kind of burnt out?
[2103.82 → 2104.06] No.
[2104.06 → 2110.42] Well, Shabbat, Sabbath means to stop, but it can also be translated to delight in.
[2111.78 → 2114.42] So stop and delight in.
[2114.68 → 2117.92] That's what God was doing, delighting in what he had created.
[2119.00 → 2121.30] You know, it kind of made me think of a story way back when,
[2121.38 → 2124.48] when I don't even know if my wife and I at that time were married,
[2124.58 → 2127.04] but we were back in New Jersey, where my wife is from,
[2127.04 → 2131.30] and it was Christmastime, and we went to these people's houses,
[2131.46 → 2132.88] these relatives for Christmas.
[2132.98 → 2133.72] I didn't know them.
[2134.04 → 2135.84] And there was a mountain of presents.
[2136.06 → 2138.20] I'd never seen so many presents in my whole life.
[2138.74 → 2142.40] And these kids were turned loose on this mountain of presents.
[2142.80 → 2145.36] And they'd rip one present open, look at it, throw it aside.
[2145.58 → 2147.00] Rip another one, throw it aside.
[2147.08 → 2148.78] Rip it, like dozens of them.
[2148.78 → 2148.90] Rip another one.
[2150.56 → 2151.80] Why do I say that?
[2153.06 → 2154.80] There was no delight.
[2156.40 → 2158.80] There was no delight in this.
[2159.72 → 2160.68] It was, what's next?
[2161.04 → 2161.64] What's next?
[2161.98 → 2162.58] What's next?
[2162.58 → 2168.34] And I think God has given us all these gifts.
[2170.32 → 2173.04] And I think a lot of us are busy just ripping days open and,
[2173.42 → 2173.86] what's next?
[2174.12 → 2175.12] Ripping, what's next?
[2175.42 → 2176.04] What's next?
[2177.92 → 2178.88] And not delighting.
[2179.34 → 2181.80] And God is trying to, okay, sit down.
[2182.18 → 2183.54] Okay, stop for a sec.
[2183.88 → 2184.98] Look at this.
[2186.36 → 2187.54] Look at your marriage.
[2187.72 → 2188.66] Look at your children.
[2188.92 → 2189.82] Look at creation.
[2190.04 → 2191.00] Look at these meals.
[2191.00 → 2193.42] Look at, look at, look at, look at the gifts.
[2196.32 → 2200.28] Dan Allende in his book on Sabbath says it well.
[2200.40 → 2205.78] He says, Sabbath is an invitation to enter delight.
[2207.14 → 2211.50] The Sabbath, when experience as God intended, is the best day of our lives.
[2213.70 → 2215.58] I think for some of you that's not your memory.
[2216.52 → 2219.00] Without question or thought, it is the best day of the week.
[2219.00 → 2222.44] It is the day we anticipate Wednesday and Thursday and Friday and Saturday.
[2222.74 → 2224.92] A day we remember on Sunday and Monday and Tuesday.
[2225.38 → 2235.02] Sabbath is the holy time when we feast, play, dance, have sex, sing, pray, laugh, tell stories, read, paint, walk, watch creation in its fullness.
[2235.02 → 2237.02] It says, few people are willing to enter the Sabbath.
[2237.02 → 2245.98] Few people are willing to enter the Sabbath and sanctify to make it holy because a day full of delight and joy is more than most people can bear in a lifetime, let alone a week.
[2246.06 → 2255.70] And then you hear God's longing for you to stop and delight and enjoy and acknowledge the gifts of life.
[2255.70 → 2263.70] Without rest, we become restless.
[2265.70 → 2271.46] We become less creative, more distracted, irritable, cynical.
[2271.46 → 2278.18] I read this poem I'm going to read to you.
[2278.90 → 2281.34] It has meant a lot to me over the last number of years.
[2283.14 → 2284.98] And it's a poem by Ted Loader.
[2286.50 → 2290.80] And there's a reference here to living unclenched.
[2290.80 → 2296.76] And I think it's a good picture of what Sabbath is trying to do.
[2296.82 → 2297.54] Let me read it to you.
[2298.28 → 2300.36] This is the poem talking to God.
[2300.36 → 2306.14] Gentle me, holy one, into an unclenched moment.
[2307.56 → 2309.00] A deep breath.
[2310.10 → 2313.04] A letting go of heavy expectancies.
[2313.52 → 2315.08] Of shrivelling anxieties.
[2315.50 → 2317.10] Of dead certainties.
[2317.10 → 2319.88] That softened by the silence.
[2320.08 → 2321.68] Surrounded by the light.
[2322.06 → 2323.54] And open to the mystery.
[2323.88 → 2326.30] I may be found by wholeness.
[2326.58 → 2328.60] Upheld by the unfathomable.
[2328.94 → 2330.70] Entranced by the simple.
[2331.18 → 2334.28] And filled with the joy that is you.
[2339.28 → 2340.44] I'm clenched.
[2342.72 → 2344.72] I get this way so fast.
[2347.10 → 2348.38] Let it go.
[2349.10 → 2349.62] Relax.
[2350.88 → 2351.40] Rest.
[2352.40 → 2353.68] God is inviting us into that.
[2354.02 → 2356.84] You know, even our bodies suffer.
[2358.00 → 2358.28] Right?
[2358.88 → 2360.42] When we don't do Sabbath well.
[2360.80 → 2366.80] God desires shalom of body and mind and soul and communities and the land and everything.
[2367.52 → 2371.18] Ancient Jews had this idea that they called Tikki slam.
[2371.18 → 2373.32] The restoration of the world.
[2373.32 → 2377.54] Where in the great darkness at the beginning of time, God's great light emerged.
[2377.82 → 2380.42] And it spread wholeness everywhere the light shone.
[2380.50 → 2381.10] There's the picture.
[2381.46 → 2383.12] And it repaired the world.
[2383.82 → 2385.68] Sabbath is part of God's great repair.
[2386.02 → 2387.62] Great repair of you.
[2388.20 → 2389.72] And all things around you.
[2391.82 → 2393.72] Isn't that something you want?
[2393.94 → 2396.64] That you feel you need?
[2396.64 → 2396.72] Right?
[2398.56 → 2403.40] But we so quickly forget to practice God's wholeness.
[2405.42 → 2408.50] Sabbath reflects God's desire for wholeness.
[2408.80 → 2410.06] It's not a rule.
[2410.64 → 2412.22] It's an invitation to wholeness.
[2412.58 → 2415.16] This is why Jesus, I think, heals on the Sabbath too.
[2415.20 → 2416.80] Because it is a day of healing.
[2419.68 → 2420.42] Here's the thing.
[2420.42 → 2421.42] Here's the thing.
[2421.66 → 2425.56] We all come to Sabbath, either voluntarily or involuntarily.
[2427.64 → 2429.42] I've had a few involuntary Sabbaths.
[2430.42 → 2434.42] You know, a period of time of burnout where I had to stop for a while.
[2435.30 → 2436.54] A couple of heart attacks.
[2437.94 → 2439.64] My Achilles last year.
[2440.88 → 2441.42] Now this vertigo.
[2442.96 → 2448.34] I had to sit in a chair and let the world spin around me and not able to do anything.
[2448.34 → 2458.66] And all of it always made me have to sit and find solace in just sitting and being still.
[2462.66 → 2463.48] I don't know.
[2463.54 → 2469.48] Maybe it's God's way of countering all my competitiveness that constantly gets brought up.
[2469.48 → 2470.48] I don't know.
[2472.68 → 2474.46] And God keeps saying.
[2475.64 → 2477.24] He invites into this rhythm.
[2477.88 → 2478.56] Stop.
[2479.50 → 2481.06] So you can delight.
[2482.34 → 2484.92] If you don't stop, you won't delight.
[2485.18 → 2486.56] They just go together.
[2486.56 → 2491.56] You forget in all the running around.
[2491.90 → 2493.66] All the crazy running around.
[2493.80 → 2494.28] You forget.
[2495.36 → 2496.92] And then I think, I was thinking about that.
[2497.12 → 2499.58] In that context, maybe there are other things we're forgetting.
[2501.40 → 2504.60] I mean, when's the last time you told your spouse you loved them?
[2506.84 → 2507.90] Or your kids?
[2508.24 → 2509.28] They know.
[2509.72 → 2510.56] Yeah, maybe they do.
[2510.64 → 2512.22] But maybe you need to say it.
[2512.42 → 2514.52] And maybe they need to hear it.
[2516.50 → 2519.04] You know, I was reading Psalm 90 verse 12.
[2520.42 → 2521.44] You know where we read,
[2521.52 → 2523.88] Teach us to number our days that we may have a heart of wisdom.
[2524.18 → 2525.08] And isn't that interesting?
[2525.08 → 2530.68] But we only number days when we stop to count.
[2534.76 → 2538.12] That numbering thing isn't going to happen if I never stop.
[2538.12 → 2542.00] I'm just going to keep running, and they're all going to blur into one big long day.
[2542.30 → 2545.08] There's no perspective without stopping.
[2548.08 → 2551.62] I'm at the beginning of a sabbatical, right?
[2551.90 → 2553.64] An extended Sabbath.
[2553.76 → 2555.54] A period of time to stop.
[2558.54 → 2559.64] To reflect.
[2561.22 → 2563.32] To count the days.
[2564.12 → 2565.12] And celebrate them.
[2565.12 → 2569.34] And to tell my wife and kids and grandkids that I love them.
[2571.62 → 2573.50] To tell this bride of Christ.
[2574.86 → 2575.74] That I love you.
[2577.58 → 2579.50] And more importantly, God loves us.
[2579.66 → 2582.20] And he invites us into his grand story of restoration.
[2582.84 → 2587.52] But he does so telling us to stop and delight along the way.
[2587.66 → 2590.96] Not going 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all the time.
[2591.18 → 2592.30] Stop, stop, stop.
[2592.30 → 2594.74] In remembrance we refocus.
[2595.48 → 2597.62] Sabbath is an act of refocusing.
[2597.90 → 2601.10] A spiritual discipline that includes, and hear me well.
[2601.36 → 2604.92] That includes eating a great meal on the patio with friends.
[2605.14 → 2608.04] You remember when we did those crazy things?
[2609.64 → 2612.34] Where we rolled the dice and said, let's get together?
[2612.34 → 2616.70] We'll do that again, won't we?
[2619.70 → 2625.20] Sabbath is a time when you can go for a walk on the beach or whatever.
[2625.44 → 2626.50] Where you can have a nap.
[2626.56 → 2627.52] Where you can play games.
[2627.78 → 2628.90] Where you can grab a good book.
[2629.06 → 2630.72] But don't have the phone on.
[2630.90 → 2632.44] And don't look at the emails.
[2632.80 → 2637.20] Try to stop the rat race for a while.
[2637.20 → 2647.14] Now, it's striking that Sabbath is the only spiritual discipline that makes it into God's top ten.
[2647.58 → 2648.40] His ten commandments.
[2649.28 → 2651.44] You know, not Bible reading, not prayer.
[2651.60 → 2653.52] No, Sabbath, keep it holy.
[2653.80 → 2653.92] Right?
[2654.32 → 2655.84] And I'm not saying those other things don't matter.
[2655.94 → 2657.22] Those are things you can do, obviously.
[2659.36 → 2662.28] You know, and then when I was looking at Exodus 20, remember the Sabbath, keep it holy.
[2662.28 → 2666.76] You know, then the ten commandments were reinstated again in Deuteronomy.
[2667.30 → 2669.08] But notice the difference in Deuteronomy.
[2669.18 → 2671.84] There's a little bit of a different thing about remembering here.
[2672.06 → 2675.48] Because I think one of the central themes of this whole message this morning is the idea of remembering.
[2676.58 → 2678.48] In Deuteronomy 5.15, we read this.
[2678.60 → 2680.94] Remember that you were slaves in Egypt.
[2681.58 → 2685.04] And that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.
[2685.30 → 2688.86] And therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.
[2689.12 → 2690.74] Now, notice what is remembered here.
[2690.74 → 2693.60] Remember you were slaves.
[2695.74 → 2697.90] Well, that's kind of depressing, isn't it?
[2698.30 → 2701.48] 400 years of slavery in the Egyptian Empire.
[2702.82 → 2704.30] And God's saying, you know what happened there?
[2704.60 → 2707.76] What happened is that that misshaped your identity.
[2708.32 → 2713.14] You know, these slaves built store cities that were all about more.
[2713.24 → 2714.52] That's why there are store cities.
[2714.70 → 2715.84] A place to put more.
[2716.28 → 2717.64] Building on the backs of the oppressed.
[2718.00 → 2719.60] Slaves don't get Sabbath.
[2719.60 → 2721.40] And then you remember one thing.
[2721.52 → 2722.26] You're a slave.
[2722.42 → 2723.04] You're a cog.
[2723.14 → 2724.24] You're a tool in the empire.
[2724.42 → 2725.32] That's who you are.
[2725.44 → 2726.06] That's it.
[2726.86 → 2730.68] And God says, remember you were once slaves.
[2732.46 → 2733.02] Once.
[2733.02 → 2737.04] Why does he bring it up again?
[2737.24 → 2740.94] Because we have tendencies to go back to slave-like thinking.
[2743.74 → 2746.80] He says, now you are daughters and sons of the Most High.
[2746.88 → 2748.42] So no going back to slavery.
[2748.60 → 2749.70] Or thinking like a slave.
[2749.84 → 2751.96] Or thinking like a slave driver for that matter.
[2752.22 → 2753.82] And we live in a culture as well.
[2753.96 → 2755.60] Of more and more and more.
[2755.80 → 2756.48] It's never enough.
[2756.56 → 2756.98] More food.
[2757.08 → 2757.52] More drinks.
[2757.62 → 2758.08] More apps.
[2758.16 → 2758.60] More toys.
[2758.70 → 2759.32] More experiences.
[2759.32 → 2761.90] And instead of store cities, we have storage units.
[2763.56 → 2764.66] To store the more.
[2767.34 → 2770.42] Walter Brueggemann described Sabbath as an act of resistance.
[2771.58 → 2773.32] Rebellion against the empire of more.
[2776.32 → 2778.14] Empire is built on the backs of the oppressed.
[2779.46 → 2780.88] It's often true today too.
[2782.22 → 2784.48] And he says Sabbath is a way to express freedom.
[2784.78 → 2785.50] And to bring freedom.
[2786.08 → 2787.80] A way of saying, it's enough.
[2787.80 → 2791.54] And we can say with the psalmist, the Lord is my shepherd.
[2791.68 → 2793.58] I lack nothing.
[2795.12 → 2796.08] I lack nothing.
[2797.86 → 2804.46] Can you imagine if in our society we just ground everything to a halt for 24 hours once a week?
[2807.36 → 2810.12] My wife Candy and I visited in New Jersey.
[2810.26 → 2812.14] We once went to a place called Ocean Park.
[2812.48 → 2815.86] It was a town, a beach town, owned by the Methodist.
[2815.86 → 2823.62] And the beaches were closed Sunday mornings because you were supposed to be in church.
[2825.24 → 2829.84] And the town, all the stores were closed for that whole Sabbath day.
[2830.48 → 2831.34] Nothing was open.
[2831.84 → 2833.76] No cars were even allowed to drive on the streets.
[2833.76 → 2836.68] And we walked through this town.
[2837.22 → 2843.04] And strollers and families and bikes and the beach in the afternoon full of people.
[2843.76 → 2846.90] And nobody running around shopping.
[2847.94 → 2849.50] It was amazing.
[2849.50 → 2853.22] It's possible.
[2855.32 → 2858.18] But okay, if our society is not going to do it, we need to.
[2860.02 → 2861.80] Ronald Rollheiser says this.
[2862.46 → 2863.26] The beautiful quote.
[2863.32 → 2863.50] He says,
[2863.50 → 2874.44] So much of our unhappiness comes from comparing our lives, our friendships, our loves, our commitments, our duties, our bodies, and our sexuality to some idealized and non-Christian vision of things.
[2874.76 → 2878.38] And when that happens, and it does, our tensions begin to drive us mad.
[2878.38 → 2884.32] In this case, to a and here's the powerful thing, a cancerous restlessness.
[2885.76 → 2887.84] A cancerous restlessness.
[2889.40 → 2892.90] True restfulness, though, is a form of awareness.
[2893.04 → 2894.10] I would like to say remembering.
[2894.54 → 2896.28] A way of being in life.
[2896.54 → 2901.64] It is living ordinary life with a sense of ease, gratitude, peace, and prayer.
[2902.06 → 2904.58] We are restful when ordinary life is enough.
[2904.58 → 2904.64] Hmm.
[2908.38 → 2909.70] Matthew 11, 28.
[2910.82 → 2911.68] Jesus says,
[2912.92 → 2920.44] Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
[2922.44 → 2924.22] I will give you rest.
[2928.62 → 2930.42] We're going to have communion together.
[2933.86 → 2937.02] In 1 Corinthians 11,
[2937.02 → 2942.50] We read this.
[2942.50 → 2952.22] The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[2952.86 → 2954.70] This is my body, which is for you.
[2955.78 → 2956.46] And here we go.
[2956.80 → 2959.54] Do this in remembrance of me.
[2959.74 → 2963.20] And I'm struck again by this idea of remembering.
[2963.20 → 2967.86] In the same way, after supper, he took the cup, saying,
[2968.50 → 2970.72] This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[2971.06 → 2976.90] Do this whenever you drink in it, drink it rather, in remembrance of me.
[2978.26 → 2982.90] For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[2982.90 → 2985.72] And Jesus is saying,
[2986.50 → 2988.12] Remember to stop.
[2989.56 → 2990.08] Sabbath.
[2990.92 → 2991.70] A whole day.
[2992.02 → 2993.04] Not just church time.
[2993.40 → 2995.34] And remember, I made it all holy.
[2995.52 → 2996.10] You too.
[2996.54 → 2998.30] And remember, you're not a slave.
[2998.40 → 2999.98] So don't live like one.
[3000.32 → 3004.02] And remember, in me, you find the rest you're really longing for.
[3004.24 → 3006.80] And in me, you find the peace and the joy and the hope.
[3007.00 → 3008.60] And you find life in all its fullness.
[3009.02 → 3011.18] In me you lack nothing.
[3011.18 → 3011.32] Amen.
[3015.78 → 3020.34] And Jesus said to those disciples that were sitting with him at the table.
[3021.40 → 3022.94] And he says to us.
[3028.44 → 3029.24] He said,
[3029.78 → 3034.46] This is my body and I give it to you.
[3035.38 → 3038.40] So that you might find real rest.
[3038.40 → 3041.84] Do this in remembrance of me.
[3042.24 → 3043.72] Stay focused on me.
[3044.00 → 3046.26] My body given for you.
[3046.38 → 3050.74] So that you might know what eternal rest looks like right now.
[3050.74 → 3055.48] Where he said,
[3055.62 → 3056.60] Where he took the cup.
[3056.84 → 3057.30] And he said,
[3057.72 → 3063.38] This cup contains my shed blood.
[3063.46 → 3067.34] Which is given for you to remind you that you are cleansed.
[3067.34 → 3069.78] Of all that enslaves you.
[3070.40 → 3072.60] So don't live like a slave.
[3073.28 → 3075.44] Because you are free in me.
[3075.44 → 3080.20] People of hope.
[3082.20 → 3082.92] Take.
[3083.74 → 3084.16] Eat.
[3085.08 → 3085.46] Drink.
[3086.26 → 3087.74] Remember and believe.
[3088.40 → 3091.92] That Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath.
[3092.92 → 3096.38] And that he is more than enough.
[3096.38 → 3104.24] There you São.
[3111.12 → 3111.88] IN.
[3111.88 → 3112.02] There you are.
[3112.06 → 3113.02] There you are.
[3113.86 → 3114.14] There you are.
[3114.14 → 3115.36] There you are.
[3115.56 → 3116.86] There you are.
[3116.94 → 3117.44] There you are.
[3117.44 → 3117.50] Amen.
[3117.50 → 3118.14] I will enjoy you.
[3118.14 → 3118.82] I am argument.
[3118.82 → 3119.06] I will enjoy you.
[3119.52 → 3120.58] There you are.
[3120.64 → 3121.22] There you are.
[3121.22 → 3148.02] Pray with me, dear Lord.
[3151.22 → 3164.60] We come before you humbled, knowing that you are what we need, really.
[3166.42 → 3174.30] Knowing that in you, we find our rest, that in you, we are free, free from the need to do more,
[3174.62 → 3181.18] free from the need to get more, free from the need to be more, free from the spirit of restlessness.
[3181.22 → 3182.36] That enslaves.
[3183.64 → 3192.52] Lord Jesus, free us to rest in you and to live in the power of the Holy Spirit each and every day.
[3193.44 → 3200.10] Help us to develop the rhythms of wholeness and health as we practice life as you have led us to lead it.
[3200.52 → 3202.76] In Jesus' name, amen.
[3202.76 → 3204.76] Amen.
[3208.90 → 3208.94] Amen.
[3208.94 → 3210.70] Amen.
[3210.72 → 3212.76] Amen.
[3212.76 → 3214.82] Amen.
[3214.82 → 3244.80] Thank you.
