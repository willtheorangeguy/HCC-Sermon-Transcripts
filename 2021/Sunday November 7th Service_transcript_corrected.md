[0.00 → 4.36] Well, good morning, Hope.
[4.94 → 6.22] It's good to be together.
[7.46 → 9.78] I'm still processing the fact that it's November
[9.78 → 12.74] and people are already putting up the Christmas lights.
[13.92 → 14.86] That's ridiculous.
[17.96 → 20.40] We've got just a few more sermons in this series
[20.40 → 22.04] before we transition to Advent.
[23.18 → 25.80] And I've really been encouraged
[25.80 → 27.64] by some of the feedback you've given me.
[28.10 → 30.22] It's always wonderful when we as pastors hear
[30.22 → 32.08] the ways in which people are stepping into
[32.08 → 34.74] the Servanthood series and realizing the call we have
[34.74 → 36.92] to be followers of Jesus who are kingdom servants.
[37.66 → 39.16] And we really want to just impress on you
[39.16 → 41.00] that this series is not about just different ways
[41.00 → 42.24] you can serve in different spheres
[42.24 → 44.08] or what servanthood looks like in specifics,
[44.18 → 44.90] although that's true.
[45.74 → 47.64] But we really want to impress on every one of us
[47.64 → 48.90] at this church that it's an identity,
[49.10 → 51.58] that to be a follower of Jesus is to be a servant
[51.58 → 53.62] in every sphere, wherever you find yourself,
[53.70 → 54.52] public or private.
[55.24 → 56.22] That's where we're aiming.
[56.22 → 58.44] And so this morning we're looking at
[58.44 → 60.30] what it means to be a servant in our homes.
[61.08 → 63.44] So I invite you, if you have your Bible on your phone
[63.44 → 66.50] or a physical Bible, turn with me to Colossians chapter 3.
[66.94 → 68.20] We're going to read that together.
[68.74 → 69.92] Verse 12 to 21.
[76.44 → 77.60] This is God's word.
[77.60 → 82.08] Therefore, as God's chosen people,
[82.42 → 84.22] holy and dearly loved,
[85.22 → 88.18] clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness,
[88.84 → 91.50] humility, gentleness, and patience.
[92.58 → 94.62] Bear with each other and forgive one another
[94.62 → 97.04] if any of you has a grievance against someone.
[97.90 → 99.76] Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
[100.58 → 101.88] And over all these virtues,
[102.64 → 103.54] put on love,
[103.92 → 105.84] which binds them together in perfect unity.
[105.84 → 109.18] Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts,
[109.52 → 112.30] since as members of one body you were called to peace.
[113.14 → 114.18] And be thankful.
[115.12 → 118.34] Let the message of Christ dwell in you richly
[118.34 → 120.10] as you teach and admonish one another
[120.10 → 121.12] with all wisdom
[121.12 → 124.18] through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit,
[124.44 → 126.58] singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.
[127.40 → 128.28] And whatever you do,
[128.78 → 129.82] whether it's in word or deed,
[129.92 → 131.58] do it in the name of Lord Jesus,
[131.94 → 133.88] giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
[133.88 → 138.30] Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands
[138.30 → 139.88] as it is fitting in the Lord.
[140.78 → 142.78] Husbands, love your wives
[142.78 → 144.14] and do not be harsh with them.
[145.12 → 147.34] Children, obey your parents in everything,
[147.56 → 148.76] for this pleases the Lord.
[149.94 → 152.22] Fathers, do not embitter your children,
[152.68 → 154.30] or they will become discouraged.
[154.30 → 162.32] Not that long ago,
[162.56 → 164.02] someone shared this phrase with me
[164.02 → 165.86] that I think is quite true.
[166.62 → 167.46] The phrase is that
[167.46 → 169.12] we are who we really are
[169.12 → 170.34] when we are at home.
[170.84 → 171.52] Have you heard that before?
[172.14 → 174.10] We are who we really are
[174.10 → 175.12] when we're at home.
[175.96 → 177.02] And I think that's true.
[177.42 → 179.16] I think you can put your best face forward
[179.16 → 180.88] with your coworkers throughout the week.
[180.88 → 182.88] You can sort of give a good presentation
[182.88 → 184.44] to your classmates in the school
[184.44 → 185.12] or your teachers
[185.12 → 187.16] or whoever you're around throughout the week.
[187.40 → 189.22] But there's something about coming home.
[190.32 → 192.24] That's when your true self shows up.
[192.90 → 193.04] Yeah?
[194.14 → 195.76] You know, and I know this is the season
[195.76 → 196.74] of parent-teacher interviews
[196.74 → 197.40] where, you know,
[197.46 → 198.66] teachers are giving the account
[198.66 → 199.88] of the children to the parents.
[199.94 → 200.60] And the parents are like,
[200.66 → 201.00] wait a minute.
[201.24 → 202.46] So they're taking care of their desks.
[202.54 → 203.76] They're cleaning up after themselves.
[203.86 → 204.86] They're listening to authority.
[205.22 → 206.76] Then the parents go up to the room of the child,
[206.82 → 207.52] which is a mess.
[207.54 → 208.32] And they're not really listening
[208.32 → 209.24] to cleaning up the room.
[209.24 → 209.72] And you're like, okay,
[209.80 → 212.00] so which child is the true child here?
[212.36 → 214.18] The school child or the home child?
[215.66 → 216.58] But there's a sense in which
[216.58 → 218.76] you can put up some sort of presentation,
[219.66 → 221.52] but the true you shows up at home.
[222.06 → 223.70] Your parents know the real you.
[223.84 → 225.90] Your roommate knows the real you.
[226.34 → 228.04] Your children know the real you.
[228.06 → 230.06] And your spouse knows the real you.
[231.56 → 232.94] We are who we are
[232.94 → 234.56] when we are at home.
[235.22 → 236.40] And that just begs the question,
[236.84 → 238.16] how's it going at home?
[239.24 → 242.24] What are the relational dynamics
[242.24 → 243.24] in your home?
[244.32 → 245.78] And what is it looking like for you
[245.78 → 247.22] in this season to be a servant
[247.22 → 248.88] of Jesus Christ
[248.88 → 251.58] and washing the feet of your neighbours
[251.58 → 253.34] in your home?
[255.22 → 256.06] You know, two weeks ago
[256.06 → 256.96] when we looked at work
[256.96 → 259.56] and how we are called to serve Christ
[259.56 → 260.12] in our work,
[260.20 → 262.78] we said that we spend vastly more time
[262.78 → 263.44] in our workplaces
[263.44 → 265.00] than we'll ever spend at this building
[265.00 → 266.24] serving on a Wednesday night
[266.24 → 267.00] or a Thursday night
[267.00 → 268.64] in one ministry or another.
[268.74 → 270.18] But the same is true for your homes.
[270.68 → 272.62] You're going to spend so much more time
[272.62 → 273.54] in your home
[273.54 → 275.72] than you will on Sunday morning
[275.72 → 276.38] and throughout the week
[276.38 → 278.02] serving as part of this community.
[279.38 → 280.34] And so it matters
[280.34 → 281.62] how we live in our homes.
[281.80 → 283.26] And I know that for many of us
[283.26 → 284.64] this past year has been a strange year
[284.64 → 286.26] where we've spent more time at home
[286.26 → 287.76] than we perhaps even wanted.
[287.76 → 290.02] And many people really struggled
[290.02 → 291.92] with the amount of time in our homes
[291.92 → 293.18] because whatever complexity
[293.18 → 294.52] and pain is going on there,
[294.82 → 296.08] we're feeling it in new ways
[296.08 → 297.88] because we're present in our homes.
[301.16 → 303.56] So how's it going in your homes?
[304.46 → 305.68] What's kingdom servanthood
[305.68 → 307.10] look like in your homes?
[307.74 → 308.60] And I think it's interesting,
[308.74 → 309.72] maybe this is not true for you,
[309.74 → 310.12] maybe it is,
[310.18 → 311.22] but I felt oftentimes
[311.22 → 312.40] when we've talked about servanthood,
[312.50 → 313.58] maybe your mind goes first
[313.58 → 314.18] to your coworkers
[314.18 → 315.18] or first to your friends
[315.18 → 315.96] or first to your neighbours
[315.96 → 316.54] down the street
[316.54 → 317.72] and we're not even stopping
[317.72 → 318.18] to think about
[318.18 → 319.36] what does it look like
[319.36 → 321.42] to be servants in our homes?
[321.90 → 322.98] And my hunch is,
[323.08 → 323.98] even for many of us,
[324.26 → 324.84] that it's actually
[324.84 → 326.26] a harder question
[326.26 → 329.12] because being servants in our homes
[329.12 → 329.86] is being servants
[329.86 → 331.76] to the people who know us deeply,
[332.34 → 334.04] who know our flaws,
[334.14 → 334.90] who know our pain,
[335.04 → 336.16] who know our weaknesses
[336.16 → 337.34] and we know theirs
[337.34 → 338.92] and it's actually more complicated
[338.92 → 340.46] and vulnerable and delicate
[340.46 → 342.10] to be a servant at home perhaps
[342.10 → 343.48] than at work.
[343.88 → 344.58] Is that true for you?
[346.60 → 347.52] Well, Colossians 3
[347.52 → 348.54] has a lot to say to us
[348.54 → 349.92] this morning about our homes.
[350.64 → 351.80] It gives specific instructions
[351.80 → 352.54] on the character
[352.54 → 353.72] that must be true for public
[353.72 → 354.98] and for our lives in private
[354.98 → 356.42] and it gives specific instructions
[356.42 → 357.24] to families,
[357.36 → 358.16] to husbands and wives
[358.16 → 358.98] and parents and children
[358.98 → 360.04] in their homes,
[360.12 → 360.96] which I believe extends
[360.96 → 362.76] beyond just the nuclear family,
[362.90 → 363.42] so to speak.
[364.06 → 365.12] But before we touch
[365.12 → 365.88] on this instruction,
[366.46 → 368.40] I want to sort of widen the lens
[368.40 → 369.06] and zoom out
[369.06 → 370.00] to see what Paul's doing
[370.00 → 371.60] in Colossians 1, 2, and 3
[371.60 → 373.78] because before he says a word
[373.78 → 375.20] about how the Christians
[375.20 → 376.20] are to live in the city
[376.20 → 377.04] and in their homes,
[377.36 → 379.28] he gives them so much good news
[379.28 → 380.84] about Jesus, who he is,
[380.88 → 382.14] and what Jesus has done for them.
[382.18 → 382.90] And I can't preach
[382.90 → 383.70] on Colossians 3
[383.70 → 385.10] without backing up the truck
[385.10 → 386.26] to Colossians 1 and 2.
[386.50 → 387.38] And it just so happens
[387.38 → 388.26] that Colossians is one
[388.26 → 389.02] of my favourite books.
[389.42 → 390.22] Colossians 1 is one
[390.22 → 391.02] of my favourite passages
[391.02 → 391.68] where it talks about
[391.68 → 392.76] the supremacy of Jesus.
[393.88 → 394.90] You know, in a culture like ours
[394.90 → 396.24] where we make Jesus very small,
[396.34 → 397.48] he's just a personal saviour,
[398.10 → 399.32] Colossians 1 describes him
[399.32 → 400.10] as the firstborn
[400.10 → 400.98] over all creation,
[401.08 → 402.36] the ruler over everything,
[402.36 → 403.52] that through his death
[403.52 → 404.08] and resurrection
[404.08 → 405.08] he's brought reconciliation
[405.08 → 406.78] to all things.
[407.66 → 408.44] Then Paul moves
[408.44 → 409.54] in Colossians 2 to say
[409.54 → 410.38] that Jesus,
[411.10 → 412.32] that cosmic Jesus,
[413.28 → 414.02] he set you free.
[414.84 → 416.36] To these little house churches
[416.36 → 417.22] throughout Asia Minor,
[417.36 → 418.64] including the city of Colossae,
[418.76 → 419.28] Paul says,
[419.66 → 420.78] do you know, church,
[421.46 → 422.26] that Jesus' death
[422.26 → 422.78] and resurrection
[422.78 → 424.04] has liberated you?
[424.34 → 425.34] You died with him.
[425.40 → 426.16] You rose with him.
[426.20 → 427.02] He cancelled your debt.
[427.08 → 427.74] He freed you
[427.74 → 428.76] from the power of sin.
[428.86 → 430.16] Church, you're free.
[430.92 → 431.46] That's what he's saying
[431.46 → 432.16] in Colossians 2.
[433.04 → 433.72] Not free to do
[433.72 → 434.42] whatever they want,
[434.50 → 435.16] as Western people
[435.16 → 435.68] often think,
[435.74 → 437.90] but free for the first time
[437.90 → 438.96] by the work of Jesus
[438.96 → 439.68] through the power
[439.68 → 440.20] of the Spirit
[440.20 → 441.12] to resist
[441.12 → 443.08] the temptation of Satan,
[444.08 → 444.90] to resist
[444.90 → 446.30] the sinful desires
[446.30 → 447.06] of the flesh,
[447.60 → 448.74] to resist
[448.74 → 450.28] the cultural mould
[450.28 → 451.36] that presses you
[451.36 → 452.46] into a form
[452.46 → 453.38] that is not
[453.38 → 454.46] how you were created.
[455.88 → 456.68] And the freedom
[456.68 → 457.54] that Jesus gives
[457.54 → 458.12] is the freedom
[458.12 → 459.70] to follow in his way.
[459.70 → 460.60] And what is that way?
[461.16 → 461.82] We've been looking at
[461.82 → 462.80] this last number of weeks.
[462.92 → 463.40] It is the way
[463.40 → 466.90] of self-sacrificial love.
[467.78 → 468.82] That's the way of freedom.
[469.76 → 470.92] So that's the context
[470.92 → 471.80] to Colossians 3.
[472.22 → 472.98] And then finally,
[473.06 → 473.80] we get to our instruction
[473.80 → 474.84] and Paul's basically saying,
[475.18 → 476.44] this is what it looks like
[476.44 → 476.98] when the church
[476.98 → 477.60] lives in freedom.
[477.78 → 478.96] This is what it looks like
[478.96 → 479.60] when they step
[479.60 → 480.70] into their new identity.
[481.34 → 481.96] And it really is
[481.96 → 482.72] about identity.
[483.08 → 483.36] Paul's saying,
[483.54 → 484.58] you've been freed by Jesus.
[484.86 → 485.84] He's figured this out
[485.84 → 486.76] for you on the cross.
[486.94 → 488.10] He's done all the work.
[488.10 → 489.82] Now you just get to work out
[489.82 → 491.30] what your freedom looks like.
[491.34 → 491.98] You get to live
[491.98 → 492.56] into the identity
[492.56 → 494.68] you already have in Jesus.
[495.86 → 497.26] And this is how he describes
[497.26 → 498.18] the community
[498.18 → 499.18] that is set free.
[499.92 → 501.22] I love this passage.
[501.38 → 501.80] He writes,
[501.98 → 502.20] therefore,
[502.40 → 504.02] as God's chosen people,
[504.84 → 507.04] holy and dearly loved,
[508.00 → 508.82] clothe yourselves
[508.82 → 509.70] with compassion,
[510.94 → 511.36] kindness,
[512.48 → 512.98] humility,
[512.98 → 514.98] gentleness,
[516.42 → 517.04] patience.
[517.96 → 518.76] Bear with each other
[518.76 → 520.02] and forgive another
[520.02 → 521.46] if they have a grievance
[521.46 → 522.28] against someone.
[523.04 → 523.84] Forgive as the Lord
[523.84 → 524.50] forgave you
[524.50 → 525.70] and over all these virtues
[525.70 → 526.96] put on love
[526.96 → 528.46] which binds them all together
[528.46 → 530.00] in perfect unity.
[531.44 → 532.54] My brother-in-law, Mark,
[532.62 → 533.44] preached on this passage
[533.44 → 534.02] in Australia
[534.02 → 534.82] a number of years ago
[534.82 → 535.74] and he had an older woman
[535.74 → 536.62] in the church read it.
[537.10 → 537.82] And as she read it,
[537.84 → 538.42] she was weeping.
[539.04 → 539.88] Perhaps because it's
[539.88 → 540.88] such a beautiful vision
[540.88 → 541.88] of what the church is,
[541.88 → 542.80] free in Christ.
[542.92 → 543.98] Or perhaps it's because
[543.98 → 544.56] she's experienced
[544.56 → 546.60] such a distant experience
[546.60 → 547.62] from the vision given
[547.62 → 548.86] in Colossians 3.
[549.90 → 551.00] What a beautiful picture
[551.00 → 551.64] of the church.
[552.16 → 552.60] Compassionate,
[552.72 → 553.08] gracious,
[553.76 → 554.20] patient,
[554.88 → 555.34] kind,
[555.74 → 556.88] bearing with the weaknesses
[556.88 → 557.38] of others,
[557.62 → 558.58] putting on love
[558.58 → 559.74] which binds them all together.
[559.94 → 560.78] That's the kind of church
[560.78 → 561.66] I want to be part of.
[562.60 → 563.22] That's the church
[563.22 → 563.98] we're not hearing about
[563.98 → 565.10] in the news lately,
[565.34 → 565.88] regrettably.
[567.70 → 568.64] And I was tempted,
[568.82 → 569.14] by the way,
[569.18 → 569.62] in this sermon
[569.62 → 570.76] just to read the passage
[570.76 → 571.60] that's specifically
[571.60 → 572.34] on household,
[572.46 → 573.22] on husbands and wives
[573.22 → 573.98] and parents and children.
[574.30 → 575.06] But I realize Paul
[575.06 → 575.84] doesn't have a sort of
[575.84 → 576.76] divided view
[576.76 → 577.94] of how the believers
[577.94 → 578.72] in the church are to live.
[578.76 → 579.38] It's not like he gives
[579.38 → 580.30] these character traits
[580.30 → 581.26] that they're to live
[581.26 → 581.86] in public
[581.86 → 583.04] that don't apply
[583.04 → 583.74] to their homes
[583.74 → 584.56] in private, right?
[585.12 → 585.76] It's not like they're
[585.76 → 586.78] just to clothe themselves
[586.78 → 587.32] in compassion
[587.32 → 588.00] when they go to work
[588.00 → 589.30] and take that clothes off,
[589.60 → 590.20] so to speak,
[590.28 → 591.08] when they get home.
[592.44 → 593.44] And when Paul gives them
[593.44 → 594.30] this list of how they're
[594.30 → 595.64] to live into this freedom,
[595.74 → 596.42] he's basically saying
[596.42 → 597.56] you want to be compassionate
[597.56 → 598.26] in the city,
[598.36 → 599.04] in your workplace,
[599.04 → 599.72] and you're to be
[599.72 → 600.32] compassionate
[600.32 → 601.66] with a child
[601.66 → 602.22] who's struggling
[602.22 → 603.14] with disobedience.
[604.46 → 605.64] You're to be humble
[605.64 → 607.34] with your neighbours
[607.34 → 608.14] down the street,
[609.26 → 610.30] whatever the reason is
[610.30 → 611.00] for you to be proud.
[611.08 → 611.62] You're to be humble
[611.62 → 612.68] and you're to be humble
[612.68 → 613.98] when you clean
[613.98 → 615.00] that toilet bowl
[615.00 → 616.42] in your home.
[618.18 → 619.66] You're to be patient
[619.66 → 620.92] with your coworkers
[620.92 → 622.22] around the boardroom table
[622.22 → 623.46] and you're to be patient
[623.46 → 624.64] with that child of yours
[624.64 → 625.50] who pokes their food
[625.50 → 626.24] around the plate
[626.24 → 628.28] which drives you crazy.
[629.66 → 630.76] So I've been told.
[630.96 → 631.40] It doesn't happen
[631.40 → 631.98] in our home.
[632.84 → 633.68] It's just hypothetical
[633.68 → 634.32] in the Unholy.
[634.46 → 635.36] The mystery of children
[635.36 → 636.28] who will not eat the food
[636.28 → 637.46] that they've said they love.
[637.74 → 638.24] Right, Reuben?
[641.42 → 642.30] Reuben's a great eater.
[643.26 → 644.24] But you get the point.
[644.72 → 645.94] The consistency of character
[645.94 → 646.54] in public
[646.54 → 647.46] when people are viewing
[647.46 → 648.24] and the consistency
[648.24 → 649.32] of character in home
[649.32 → 650.38] when just the people
[650.38 → 651.10] who know you deeply
[651.10 → 651.74] are watching
[651.74 → 652.52] and you're more
[652.52 → 653.76] your true self.
[653.76 → 654.94] And I think one of the
[654.94 → 655.72] the greatest criticisms
[655.72 → 656.78] someone can receive
[656.78 → 657.96] is when you hear
[657.96 → 658.94] and perhaps you've heard this
[658.94 → 659.26] where they say
[659.26 → 660.00] oh yeah, at work
[660.00 → 660.54] they're this way.
[660.60 → 661.42] They're loved at work
[661.42 → 661.96] but you don't know
[661.96 → 662.78] what they're like at home.
[664.32 → 665.08] She's well-loved
[665.08 → 665.62] by her friends
[665.62 → 666.16] when they're out together
[666.16 → 666.66] but you don't know
[666.66 → 667.62] how she speaks at home.
[668.80 → 669.96] Her friends think this about her.
[670.00 → 671.04] His friends think this about him
[671.04 → 672.28] but that's not the true story
[672.28 → 673.04] when you see them at home.
[673.32 → 674.14] What a statement.
[675.54 → 676.26] And I get it.
[676.28 → 677.14] We have different relationships
[677.14 → 677.58] at home.
[677.68 → 678.32] People are in on
[678.32 → 679.50] our inner lives and homes.
[679.80 → 680.18] You're not supposed
[680.18 → 680.82] to have the same kind
[680.82 → 681.20] of relationship
[681.20 → 682.36] but our character
[682.36 → 683.28] should have some level
[683.28 → 683.94] of consistency.
[684.66 → 685.18] We shouldn't be
[685.18 → 685.50] the sort of
[685.50 → 686.58] Jekyll and Hyde
[686.58 → 687.54] from public to private.
[688.24 → 689.16] And I think as we mature
[689.16 → 689.60] in Christ
[689.60 → 690.90] as we step into obedience
[690.90 → 691.66] there should be a sense
[691.66 → 692.70] in which your spouse
[692.70 → 693.20] is going to see
[693.20 → 693.92] the same you
[693.92 → 695.12] that your co-workers see.
[695.60 → 696.26] Your classmates
[696.26 → 696.76] are going to see
[696.76 → 697.40] the same you
[697.40 → 698.68] that your friends see
[698.68 → 700.24] or that your kids see.
[701.08 → 702.18] A sense of character
[702.18 → 703.14] that is consistent
[703.14 → 704.90] as we mature in Christ.
[704.90 → 708.08] But then Paul goes
[708.08 → 709.14] to give really specific
[709.14 → 710.44] instructions to the homes
[710.44 → 712.08] and I want us to see
[712.08 → 712.94] this section on husbands
[712.94 → 713.36] and wives
[713.36 → 714.12] and parents and children
[714.12 → 714.90] as Paul bringing
[714.90 → 715.68] the good news of Jesus
[715.68 → 716.60] to bear on the home.
[717.84 → 718.64] And people then
[718.64 → 719.56] just like people today
[719.56 → 720.30] they grew up with
[720.30 → 720.98] cultural moulds
[720.98 → 722.18] on how marriage should be
[722.18 → 723.06] and how family should be
[723.06 → 723.86] and how the home
[723.86 → 724.38] should look.
[725.08 → 725.64] And there were Jews
[725.64 → 726.06] who grew up with
[726.06 → 726.90] the Jewish way of life
[726.90 → 727.74] the Romans who grew up
[727.74 → 728.66] with the Roman way of life
[728.66 → 729.36] just like you and I
[729.36 → 729.72] grew up with
[729.72 → 730.80] the Canadian way of life
[730.80 → 732.10] which we'll critique later on.
[732.92 → 733.92] And Paul is basically saying
[733.92 → 734.94] whatever you grew up with
[734.94 → 735.80] that's not your norm.
[735.88 → 736.54] The norm is
[736.54 → 737.94] the life and the love
[737.94 → 738.98] of Jesus Christ
[738.98 → 739.96] reigning in your home.
[740.28 → 741.16] That's the new norm.
[741.88 → 742.52] And so let's look at
[742.52 → 743.62] how he brings that to bear
[743.62 → 745.08] in these different relationships.
[745.30 → 746.72] First he talks to spouses.
[747.66 → 748.26] Verse 18
[748.26 → 750.68] Wives submit to your husbands
[750.68 → 752.48] as it is fitting in the Lord.
[753.58 → 755.70] Husbands love your wives
[755.70 → 757.70] and do not be harsh with them.
[759.62 → 760.90] Now I feel like there's a few of us
[760.90 → 761.56] who are like pulling up
[761.56 → 762.04] the popcorn.
[762.26 → 763.60] Like what's Dave going to say
[763.60 → 764.28] about submission?
[765.48 → 766.38] If you've been around the church
[766.38 → 767.14] you'll know that that's
[767.14 → 768.64] a divisive issue
[768.64 → 770.00] people reading the New Testament
[770.00 → 770.62] and what does it say
[770.62 → 771.60] about husbands and wives
[771.60 → 772.82] and how their power relates
[772.82 → 773.80] and what not.
[774.34 → 774.88] And it's true
[774.88 → 776.32] that this is a triggering passage
[776.32 → 777.74] because this passage
[777.74 → 778.64] has been used
[778.64 → 779.50] to prop up
[779.50 → 780.88] an unhealthy patriarchy
[780.88 → 782.40] an unhealthy power
[782.40 → 783.28] that the husband has
[783.28 → 783.68] in the home
[783.68 → 785.34] and that has been weaponized
[785.34 → 786.88] in unhealthy ways
[786.88 → 787.92] to women and to children
[787.92 → 788.92] and we want to name that.
[789.86 → 790.76] But I happen to believe
[790.76 → 791.70] and I'm in good company
[791.70 → 792.44] with good scholars
[792.44 → 793.32] who say this passage
[793.32 → 795.16] is very subversive
[795.16 → 797.08] on this very topic
[797.08 → 799.40] because I think culturally speaking
[799.40 → 799.98] the singer,
[800.12 → 800.52] the punch,
[800.60 → 801.10] the triggering
[801.10 → 803.08] that actually is in what Paul says
[803.08 → 803.56] to the men
[803.56 → 805.32] not to the women.
[805.32 → 808.04] I think culturally speaking
[808.04 → 809.10] when Paul says to women
[809.10 → 810.06] submit to your husbands
[810.06 → 811.66] that makes sense.
[812.10 → 812.88] That's what they expect.
[812.98 → 814.02] That's what they signed up for
[814.02 → 814.62] in marriage.
[815.16 → 815.98] But that's not true
[815.98 → 816.86] when he speaks to the men
[816.86 → 817.28] when he says
[817.28 → 819.06] husbands love your wives
[819.06 → 820.16] and do not be harsh to them
[820.16 → 821.94] that's not the cultural mould.
[822.20 → 823.48] Paul's curbing things
[823.48 → 824.28] pretty drastically.
[824.98 → 825.68] Let me just give you
[825.68 → 826.34] a thumbnail sketch
[826.34 → 827.18] of the Roman mould.
[827.52 → 828.50] Not so much the Jewish mould
[828.50 → 829.54] but the Roman one for sure
[829.54 → 831.18] in this Roman city of Colossae.
[832.06 → 832.98] Men had all the power.
[832.98 → 834.82] They wanted to get married
[834.82 → 835.56] so they had kids
[835.56 → 836.52] but their relationship
[836.52 → 837.02] to their wife
[837.02 → 837.82] was not one of sort of
[837.82 → 838.54] covenant fidelity.
[838.72 → 839.48] They could go to the temple
[839.48 → 840.58] and find some pleasure there.
[840.82 → 841.48] They could have a spouse
[841.48 → 842.10] on the side.
[842.20 → 842.66] They could sort of
[842.66 → 843.62] discard their wife
[843.62 → 844.40] if they weren't happy.
[844.80 → 845.46] The same is true
[845.46 → 846.20] in terms of the power
[846.20 → 846.94] they had over children.
[847.08 → 847.96] It was not good.
[849.28 → 850.38] And now Paul comes in
[850.38 → 851.28] and he says to these people
[851.28 → 852.36] who grew up in this city
[852.36 → 852.86] he says hey
[852.86 → 854.72] the new norm for you
[854.72 → 855.50] now that you've stepped
[855.50 → 856.36] into faith in Jesus
[856.36 → 857.20] now that you're following
[857.20 → 857.80] him in obedience
[857.80 → 860.14] the law of the love of Jesus
[860.14 → 862.12] must shape your love
[862.12 → 862.96] for your wife.
[863.50 → 864.56] And you can't be harsh
[864.56 → 865.00] with her.
[866.48 → 867.88] That would be controversial.
[868.46 → 869.30] I feel like it would be
[869.30 → 870.28] like the mic drop
[870.28 → 871.32] in the room
[871.32 → 872.34] as this letter is being read
[872.34 → 872.80] the men are like
[872.80 → 873.16] whoa
[873.16 → 875.16] that's a trigger.
[876.76 → 877.52] And it's not just
[877.52 → 878.58] some vague sense of love
[878.58 → 879.44] that Paul is talking about.
[879.58 → 880.80] If you read Ephesians 5
[880.80 → 881.32] which I think
[881.32 → 882.36] Colossians 3
[882.36 → 883.40] is a condensed version
[883.40 → 884.24] of Ephesians 5
[884.24 → 885.24] but when Paul writes
[885.24 → 886.22] this letter to Ephesians
[886.22 → 886.82] he says
[886.82 → 887.44] the kind of love
[887.44 → 888.30] you have for your spouse
[888.30 → 889.08] that needs to be
[889.08 → 890.82] sacrificial love
[890.82 → 892.80] mirrored after Jesus
[892.80 → 894.24] who died for his bride
[894.24 → 896.06] who gave up his life
[896.06 → 896.58] for his bride
[896.58 → 897.94] that's the kind of love
[897.94 → 898.98] the self-giving
[898.98 → 900.62] outpouring love
[900.62 → 901.40] that the husband
[901.40 → 902.42] is to have for the wife.
[903.84 → 904.62] That's something.
[905.68 → 906.56] And just to circle back
[906.56 → 907.08] to submission
[907.08 → 907.62] do you know how
[907.62 → 908.72] Paul starts
[908.72 → 910.04] his teaching on marriage
[910.04 → 910.84] in Ephesians 5?
[911.56 → 912.14] He says
[912.14 → 914.06] submit to one another
[914.06 → 915.64] out of reverence
[915.64 → 916.28] for Christ.
[919.06 → 919.82] Mic drop.
[922.58 → 923.64] It's a game changer.
[924.36 → 924.94] The gospel
[924.94 → 926.20] coming to bear
[926.20 → 927.64] on the home.
[928.66 → 929.06] The norm
[929.06 → 930.02] is not what you want.
[930.14 → 930.36] The norm
[930.36 → 931.34] is not what is acceptable
[931.34 → 932.30] by Roman standards.
[932.46 → 932.74] The norm
[932.74 → 933.74] is sacrificial
[933.74 → 934.98] self-giving love.
[935.26 → 936.00] It is replacing
[936.00 → 936.62] harshness
[936.62 → 937.68] with tenderness.
[938.28 → 938.92] The very tenderness
[938.92 → 939.34] that Misha
[939.34 → 940.42] started our service with.
[940.48 → 941.04] The very tenderness
[941.04 → 942.54] of God's own heart
[942.54 → 944.06] as he walks with us.
[946.50 → 947.60] But Paul keeps going.
[947.88 → 948.40] He talks about
[948.40 → 949.42] parents and children.
[949.56 → 950.32] I want to read for you
[950.32 → 951.22] what he says next.
[951.32 → 951.56] He says
[951.56 → 952.96] children obey your parents
[952.96 → 953.68] in everything
[953.68 → 955.82] for this pleases the Lord.
[956.60 → 957.32] Fathers do not
[957.32 → 958.12] embitter your children
[958.12 → 959.48] or they will become
[959.48 → 960.40] discouraged.
[962.12 → 962.92] Now I'm not going to
[962.92 → 963.56] spend as much time
[963.56 → 964.20] talking about this
[964.20 → 965.08] because we just touched
[965.08 → 966.30] on this in our Exodus series
[966.30 → 966.96] and we talked about
[966.96 → 968.66] how God generously
[968.66 → 969.48] and graciously
[969.48 → 970.40] places children
[970.40 → 971.42] under the authority
[971.42 → 972.12] of their parents
[972.12 → 973.36] and the parents
[973.36 → 974.46] have this overwhelming
[974.46 → 975.50] and beautiful
[975.50 → 976.26] responsibility
[976.26 → 977.04] of speaking
[977.04 → 977.72] the good news
[977.72 → 978.28] of teaching
[978.28 → 978.88] the good news
[978.88 → 980.16] of modelling
[980.16 → 981.28] the good news
[981.28 → 982.54] and we shared
[982.54 → 983.02] in that sermon
[983.02 → 984.06] that more is caught
[984.06 → 984.60] than taught.
[984.70 → 985.56] Kids are always watching
[985.56 → 986.18] how we live
[986.18 → 986.90] and they often walk
[986.90 → 987.50] in those ways
[987.50 → 988.02] rather than just
[988.02 → 988.78] what we say
[988.78 → 989.44] they should do.
[990.32 → 991.60] But children are to obey
[991.60 → 992.68] that good instruction.
[992.82 → 993.52] They are to listen
[993.52 → 994.28] to their parents
[994.28 → 994.98] and you should know
[994.98 → 996.24] that many people
[996.24 → 996.96] who come to Canada
[996.96 → 997.66] and they get to know
[997.66 → 998.64] the Western way of life
[998.64 → 999.14] they often say
[999.14 → 999.74] man like
[999.74 → 1000.78] children have a lot
[1000.78 → 1001.38] of power here.
[1001.46 → 1002.00] They don't really have
[1002.00 → 1003.04] to listen to their parents
[1003.04 → 1003.54] and there's not a lot
[1003.54 → 1004.64] of recourse
[1004.64 → 1005.60] if they're disobedient
[1005.60 → 1006.04] and there's sort
[1006.04 → 1006.72] of this assumption
[1006.72 → 1007.78] that like Western parents
[1007.78 → 1008.80] don't really care
[1008.80 → 1009.66] if their kids are obedient
[1009.66 → 1010.50] and kids I want you
[1010.50 → 1010.96] to hear this.
[1011.58 → 1013.02] The statement God gives
[1013.02 → 1014.68] through this letter
[1014.68 → 1015.82] is obedience.
[1017.20 → 1018.02] Listen to the wise
[1018.02 → 1019.06] counsel of your parents
[1019.06 → 1020.82] and know
[1020.82 → 1022.60] it's not carte blanche.
[1023.50 → 1024.50] It's really significant
[1024.50 → 1025.44] in Ephesians again
[1025.44 → 1026.60] which is also a co-text
[1026.60 → 1027.14] to this one.
[1027.26 → 1027.70] Paul says
[1027.70 → 1028.84] children obey your parents
[1028.84 → 1029.58] what does he say next?
[1030.30 → 1031.10] In the Lord
[1031.10 → 1032.60] for this is right
[1032.60 → 1033.40] and there's assumption
[1033.40 → 1034.36] that it's not just
[1034.36 → 1035.04] your parents get to say
[1035.04 → 1035.62] whatever they want
[1035.62 → 1036.44] it's in the Lord
[1036.44 → 1037.34] and the highest authority
[1037.34 → 1037.82] is Jesus
[1037.82 → 1038.72] and under that
[1038.72 → 1039.36] is the parents
[1039.36 → 1040.14] and if parents
[1040.14 → 1041.50] are giving foolish advice
[1041.50 → 1042.40] if they're giving
[1042.40 → 1043.38] poor counsel
[1043.38 → 1044.46] if they're commanding
[1044.46 → 1045.34] things that are destructive
[1045.34 → 1046.32] or dehumanizing
[1046.32 → 1046.82] or abusive
[1046.82 → 1048.44] that must be
[1048.44 → 1049.70] out of obedience
[1049.70 → 1050.88] to Jesus resisted
[1050.88 → 1052.58] and not listened to.
[1052.82 → 1053.64] That's an important
[1053.64 → 1054.26] qualification
[1054.26 → 1055.44] and there's
[1055.44 → 1056.10] no shortage
[1056.10 → 1056.88] of situations
[1056.88 → 1058.14] where abusive parents
[1058.14 → 1059.98] are given way too much power
[1059.98 → 1060.96] or think they deserve it
[1060.96 → 1062.10] and our following
[1062.10 → 1062.68] of Jesus
[1062.68 → 1064.00] requires us
[1064.00 → 1065.04] to filter their instruction
[1065.04 → 1065.76] through what Christ
[1065.76 → 1066.42] calls us to be
[1066.42 → 1066.84] as children.
[1069.30 → 1070.28] But see what Paul
[1070.28 → 1070.84] is doing here
[1070.84 → 1071.80] he's bringing the gospel
[1071.80 → 1072.96] to bear on the family
[1072.96 → 1073.92] and notice what he's
[1073.92 → 1074.72] curbing here again
[1074.72 → 1075.36] he goes back
[1075.36 → 1076.44] to the dads
[1076.44 → 1078.08] and this is obviously
[1078.08 → 1078.80] something Paul's
[1078.80 → 1079.66] concerned about
[1079.66 → 1080.40] in Colossians
[1080.40 → 1081.54] where he sees these dads
[1081.54 → 1082.76] being harsh
[1082.76 → 1083.28] with their kids
[1083.28 → 1083.80] so he says
[1083.80 → 1084.48] do not embitter
[1084.48 → 1084.92] your children
[1084.92 → 1085.82] or they will become
[1085.82 → 1086.64] discouraged
[1086.64 → 1087.22] and that's fairly
[1087.22 → 1087.74] straightforward
[1088.14 → 1089.24] and the same
[1089.24 → 1089.90] is true in Ephesians
[1089.90 → 1090.30] when he says
[1090.30 → 1091.80] do not exasperate them
[1091.80 → 1093.36] and the point is simple
[1093.36 → 1094.84] the gospel has to change
[1094.84 → 1095.64] the way we live
[1095.64 → 1096.20] with our kids
[1096.20 → 1096.84] it has to change
[1096.84 → 1097.96] the way we shape them
[1097.96 → 1098.58] and teach them
[1098.58 → 1099.40] and live with them
[1099.40 → 1100.90] from a place of harshness
[1100.90 → 1101.60] to a place of
[1101.60 → 1102.64] tender
[1102.64 → 1103.90] patient
[1103.90 → 1105.04] love
[1105.04 → 1106.72] no it's not easy
[1106.72 → 1107.34] but we're called
[1107.34 → 1108.10] to do that
[1108.10 → 1109.92] we're not to pick
[1109.92 → 1110.62] fights with them
[1110.62 → 1111.32] this is what sort of
[1111.32 → 1112.06] exasperating
[1112.06 → 1112.58] and embittering
[1112.58 → 1113.28] them comes out of
[1113.28 → 1114.42] it's like picking fights
[1114.42 → 1115.14] provoking
[1115.14 → 1116.18] stirring anger
[1116.18 → 1116.58] in them
[1116.58 → 1117.24] but we're to live
[1117.24 → 1117.94] sacrificially
[1117.94 → 1118.68] and tenderly
[1118.68 → 1119.36] with them
[1119.36 → 1121.62] bearing with the sins
[1121.62 → 1123.16] they bring into our home
[1123.16 → 1124.96] one scholar
[1124.96 → 1125.60] puts it this way
[1125.60 → 1126.54] and I quite like this quote
[1126.54 → 1126.80] he says
[1126.80 → 1127.36] fathering
[1127.36 → 1128.54] slash parenting
[1128.54 → 1130.40] was radically reshaped
[1130.40 → 1131.50] by the gospel
[1131.50 → 1132.34] of love
[1132.34 → 1133.38] for love
[1133.38 → 1133.90] here would mean
[1133.90 → 1134.64] a father's rugged
[1134.64 → 1135.00] commitment
[1135.00 → 1136.80] to be with his kids
[1136.80 → 1139.16] and to be for his children
[1139.16 → 1140.98] and all of this
[1140.98 → 1141.92] as the family grows
[1141.92 → 1142.92] in Christ likeness
[1142.92 → 1145.10] I'm hoping you're getting
[1145.10 → 1146.16] the movement here
[1146.16 → 1146.96] Paul is saying
[1146.96 → 1148.08] this is the world
[1148.08 → 1148.76] you're growing up in
[1148.76 → 1149.16] in Rome
[1149.16 → 1150.02] in Colossae
[1150.02 → 1151.06] and now I want you
[1151.06 → 1151.70] to see what it looks like
[1151.70 → 1152.96] to be free in Christ
[1152.96 → 1154.16] as you live in your homes
[1154.16 → 1155.10] as husbands and wives
[1155.10 → 1155.98] as parents and children
[1155.98 → 1157.18] I want you to step
[1157.18 → 1157.94] into this freedom
[1157.94 → 1159.22] and this is what it looks like
[1159.22 → 1160.42] to clothe yourselves
[1160.42 → 1161.04] with this character
[1161.04 → 1161.84] around your family
[1161.84 → 1163.56] to speak this way
[1163.56 → 1164.96] to love this way
[1164.96 → 1166.68] to move towards tenderness
[1166.68 → 1167.64] away from harshness
[1167.64 → 1168.80] that's the freedom
[1168.80 → 1170.08] the gospel of Jesus
[1170.08 → 1170.88] brings to the home
[1170.88 → 1172.08] the freedom that parents
[1172.08 → 1173.60] and children are stepping into
[1173.60 → 1175.40] as they follow Jesus
[1175.40 → 1178.44] now here's the question
[1178.44 → 1179.44] I was wrestling with
[1179.44 → 1180.80] a lot this week
[1180.80 → 1182.88] Paul's speaking to that time
[1182.88 → 1183.60] and that place
[1183.60 → 1184.62] he's contextualizing
[1184.62 → 1185.36] the good news of Jesus
[1185.36 → 1186.18] to these homes
[1186.18 → 1187.08] with those challenges
[1187.08 → 1188.04] and I'm asking
[1188.04 → 1188.92] what are the threats
[1188.92 → 1189.74] to our homes
[1189.74 → 1192.00] are they the same
[1192.00 → 1193.92] as what he's saying
[1193.92 → 1194.62] to these families
[1194.62 → 1196.58] and I want to say
[1196.58 → 1197.42] before I move on
[1197.42 → 1198.94] to sort of work out
[1198.94 → 1199.62] what I see as threats
[1199.62 → 1200.08] to our homes
[1200.08 → 1201.02] if the shoe fits
[1201.02 → 1202.72] do the hard work
[1202.72 → 1203.80] have the hard conversations
[1203.80 → 1204.94] bring this conversation
[1204.94 → 1205.70] to the dinner table
[1205.70 → 1206.24] with your kids
[1206.24 → 1207.02] or with your spouse
[1207.02 → 1208.66] make that conversation happen
[1208.66 → 1209.66] because Paul wants us
[1209.66 → 1210.56] to wrestle with
[1210.56 → 1211.20] what does it mean
[1211.20 → 1211.96] to love our spouse
[1211.96 → 1212.36] what does it mean
[1212.36 → 1213.28] to submit to our spouse
[1213.28 → 1213.70] what does it mean
[1213.70 → 1215.10] to be kind and gentle
[1215.10 → 1215.64] with our kids
[1215.64 → 1216.14] and not harsh
[1216.14 → 1217.52] like have those conversations
[1217.52 → 1219.32] but I happen to think
[1219.32 → 1220.04] if Paul was writing
[1220.04 → 1220.42] this letter
[1220.42 → 1221.46] to our church right now
[1221.46 → 1222.64] there would be
[1222.64 → 1223.22] some other things
[1223.22 → 1224.04] he would add to this letter
[1224.04 → 1225.14] perhaps they would shift
[1225.14 → 1225.84] in focus
[1225.84 → 1227.30] and so
[1227.30 → 1229.08] here are two things
[1229.08 → 1229.70] and I was going to say
[1229.70 → 1230.20] more than that
[1230.20 → 1230.86] but I realized my sermon
[1230.86 → 1231.84] was getting way out of hand
[1231.84 → 1232.56] way too long
[1232.56 → 1233.44] so out of mercy
[1233.44 → 1234.08] to the church
[1234.08 → 1234.90] you're welcome
[1234.90 → 1236.16] I'm only going to say
[1236.16 → 1236.72] two things
[1236.72 → 1237.42] if you want to hear the rest
[1237.42 → 1238.02] we can talk
[1238.02 → 1239.36] for coffee afterwards
[1239.36 → 1241.26] number one
[1241.26 → 1242.94] a threat
[1242.94 → 1244.16] to the health of our homes
[1244.16 → 1244.86] a threat
[1244.86 → 1246.16] to being servants
[1246.16 → 1246.74] in our home
[1246.74 → 1247.26] is
[1247.26 → 1248.98] busyness
[1248.98 → 1251.54] tell me I'm wrong
[1251.54 → 1253.76] busyness
[1253.76 → 1255.28] I don't know
[1255.28 → 1255.84] too many dads
[1255.84 → 1256.32] in our church
[1256.32 → 1256.78] now I don't know
[1256.78 → 1257.24] all the dads
[1257.24 → 1257.56] I don't know
[1257.56 → 1258.06] too many dads
[1258.06 → 1258.44] in our church
[1258.44 → 1258.90] who are trying
[1258.90 → 1260.32] to grasp after power
[1260.32 → 1260.82] in their home
[1260.82 → 1261.48] in unhealthy ways
[1261.48 → 1262.12] that could be true
[1262.12 → 1262.36] and again
[1262.36 → 1263.04] if the shoe fits
[1263.04 → 1263.84] hear that
[1263.84 → 1264.54] for all its worth
[1264.54 → 1265.52] but I do know
[1265.52 → 1266.78] a lot of parents
[1266.78 → 1268.78] husbands and wives
[1268.78 → 1269.56] who are cranking out
[1269.56 → 1271.10] some pretty crazy hours
[1271.10 → 1271.64] at work
[1271.64 → 1272.84] who aren't really
[1272.84 → 1273.94] around that much
[1273.94 → 1274.48] at home
[1274.48 → 1276.30] and even when we get home
[1276.30 → 1277.50] the person that's there
[1277.50 → 1279.50] is an exhausted self
[1279.50 → 1280.90] not present
[1280.90 → 1282.64] and ready to engage
[1282.64 → 1283.48] in deep relational
[1283.48 → 1284.50] meaningful ways
[1284.50 → 1286.84] busyness
[1286.84 → 1287.88] and I just want you
[1287.88 → 1288.16] to know
[1288.16 → 1288.58] I'm preaching
[1288.58 → 1289.40] to myself here
[1289.40 → 1290.96] I can still remember
[1290.96 → 1292.34] before Brittany and I
[1292.34 → 1292.84] came to Hope
[1292.84 → 1293.52] I was full-time
[1293.52 → 1294.02] youth pastor
[1294.02 → 1294.54] at a church
[1294.54 → 1295.90] I was part-time
[1295.90 → 1296.34] at Regent
[1296.34 → 1297.42] we had two kids
[1297.42 → 1298.74] three before we moved here
[1298.74 → 1300.38] and I was out a lot
[1300.38 → 1300.76] at night
[1300.76 → 1301.64] doing ministry
[1301.64 → 1302.32] with young adults
[1302.32 → 1303.10] international students
[1303.10 → 1303.52] and youth
[1303.52 → 1304.98] and when I wasn't
[1304.98 → 1305.52] out at night
[1305.52 → 1306.06] I was often
[1306.06 → 1306.90] reading books
[1306.90 → 1307.66] writing papers
[1307.66 → 1308.20] trying to finish
[1308.20 → 1308.66] this degree
[1308.66 → 1309.26] and you know
[1309.26 → 1310.04] how it often goes
[1310.04 → 1311.06] is business increases
[1311.06 → 1311.58] you just learn
[1311.58 → 1312.30] to juggle more
[1312.30 → 1312.94] and you think
[1312.94 → 1313.42] it's fine
[1313.42 → 1313.72] right
[1313.72 → 1314.72] it always does
[1314.72 → 1315.32] catch up to you
[1315.32 → 1315.64] that's why
[1315.64 → 1316.52] burnout is a thing
[1316.52 → 1317.12] your business
[1317.12 → 1317.88] always catches up
[1317.88 → 1318.02] to you
[1318.02 → 1318.70] but in that season
[1318.70 → 1320.16] I was pretty oblivious
[1320.16 → 1321.16] to what was going on
[1321.16 → 1322.02] it wasn't until
[1322.02 → 1323.14] I finished my masters
[1323.14 → 1324.10] and I was home
[1324.10 → 1324.90] for a few more nights
[1324.90 → 1325.30] of the week
[1325.30 → 1326.20] that I realized
[1326.20 → 1326.88] just how much
[1326.88 → 1327.50] Brittany was doing
[1327.50 → 1330.24] how many bedtimes
[1330.24 → 1331.08] she did without me
[1331.08 → 1332.96] the reading of the stories
[1332.96 → 1333.98] the talking to the kids
[1333.98 → 1334.86] and all the chores
[1334.86 → 1335.46] around the house
[1335.46 → 1336.00] after that
[1336.00 → 1337.00] and my eyes were open
[1337.00 → 1338.10] after I finished my masters
[1338.10 → 1338.50] I was like
[1338.50 → 1339.36] whoa
[1339.36 → 1342.14] I've missed out on a lot
[1342.14 → 1344.44] I have not been present
[1344.44 → 1345.24] to my family
[1345.24 → 1347.22] and that's a problem
[1347.22 → 1349.44] and I bet you
[1349.44 → 1350.50] I'm not the only one
[1350.50 → 1353.28] and when I talk about
[1353.28 → 1354.38] this threat of busyness
[1354.38 → 1354.98] to our homes
[1354.98 → 1355.68] and being servants
[1355.68 → 1356.26] in our home
[1356.26 → 1357.46] I'm not just talking
[1357.46 → 1357.88] about work
[1357.88 → 1358.50] I'm talking about
[1358.50 → 1359.62] the frenzied pace
[1359.62 → 1360.36] of our house
[1360.36 → 1361.72] so that's sports
[1361.72 → 1362.34] that's music
[1362.34 → 1363.54] that's after school programs
[1363.54 → 1364.36] that's what you volunteer
[1364.36 → 1364.94] for in the neighbourhood
[1364.94 → 1366.22] and even at the church
[1366.22 → 1368.62] if the pace of our homes
[1368.62 → 1369.22] is frenzied
[1369.22 → 1370.18] it's a loss
[1370.18 → 1371.40] if you're winning
[1371.40 → 1372.30] everywhere else
[1372.30 → 1372.84] so to speak
[1372.84 → 1373.46] and the home
[1373.46 → 1374.58] is a frenzied mess
[1374.58 → 1375.40] that's not a win
[1375.40 → 1376.64] and I don't think
[1376.64 → 1377.62] Christ delights in you
[1377.62 → 1378.60] volunteering like crazy
[1378.60 → 1378.96] at the church
[1378.96 → 1379.90] if it's on the
[1379.90 → 1380.38] you know
[1380.38 → 1381.64] sacrificing your time
[1381.64 → 1382.26] with your family
[1382.26 → 1383.64] or your roommates
[1383.64 → 1384.48] or your spouse
[1384.48 → 1386.06] that's not the vision
[1386.06 → 1386.72] for the home
[1386.72 → 1387.98] don't you think
[1387.98 → 1390.10] and I really do think
[1390.10 → 1392.26] we need to take stock
[1392.26 → 1393.36] of the pace
[1393.36 → 1393.94] of our homes
[1393.94 → 1395.54] and take stock
[1395.54 → 1396.70] of the sort of
[1396.70 → 1397.72] pace that we're all
[1397.72 → 1398.18] living at
[1398.18 → 1398.88] the culture
[1398.88 → 1399.54] it's creating
[1399.54 → 1400.38] the way it's forming
[1400.38 → 1401.72] or deforming us
[1401.72 → 1402.66] all of us
[1402.66 → 1403.40] not just kids
[1403.40 → 1406.78] I also think
[1406.78 → 1408.22] that it's very unlikely
[1408.22 → 1408.94] and I do mean
[1408.94 → 1409.98] very unlikely
[1409.98 → 1410.64] that a home
[1410.64 → 1411.14] that works
[1411.14 → 1412.12] at a frenzied pace
[1412.12 → 1412.56] the home
[1412.56 → 1413.16] where it's running
[1413.16 → 1414.18] at a million miles an hour
[1414.18 → 1415.36] that is not going
[1415.36 → 1416.08] to be the home
[1416.08 → 1417.44] where there's kindness
[1417.44 → 1419.30] gentleness
[1419.30 → 1420.72] forgiveness
[1420.72 → 1422.08] where you have
[1422.08 → 1422.64] the capacity
[1422.64 → 1423.14] to bear
[1423.14 → 1423.78] with the weaknesses
[1423.78 → 1424.28] of others
[1424.28 → 1425.22] and forgive one another
[1425.22 → 1425.90] and just live
[1425.90 → 1427.08] in a posture of love
[1427.08 → 1428.28] I think
[1428.28 → 1429.38] a home
[1429.38 → 1430.14] that has an unhealthy
[1430.14 → 1431.06] pace is far more
[1431.06 → 1431.78] likely to fall
[1431.78 → 1432.44] into the traps
[1432.44 → 1433.02] that Paul talks
[1433.02 → 1433.52] about earlier
[1433.52 → 1434.44] in Colossians 3
[1434.44 → 1435.30] which are
[1435.30 → 1436.56] evil desires
[1436.56 → 1437.40] greed
[1437.40 → 1438.50] malice
[1438.50 → 1439.34] slander
[1439.34 → 1439.84] anger
[1439.84 → 1440.42] lust
[1440.42 → 1441.86] sexual immorality
[1441.86 → 1442.86] don't you think
[1442.86 → 1443.76] that's more likely
[1443.76 → 1444.24] to happen
[1444.24 → 1445.46] when there's not
[1445.46 → 1446.14] a healthy pace
[1446.14 → 1446.68] in your home
[1446.68 → 1447.76] when people aren't
[1447.76 → 1448.24] present
[1448.24 → 1449.44] sharing meals
[1449.44 → 1450.32] checking in
[1450.32 → 1451.22] deepening in
[1451.22 → 1451.72] relationship
[1451.72 → 1452.52] and intimacy
[1452.52 → 1453.40] and love
[1453.40 → 1455.04] as people in a home
[1455.04 → 1457.90] so that's the first
[1457.90 → 1458.24] threat
[1458.24 → 1460.18] busyness
[1460.18 → 1461.42] the second one
[1461.42 → 1462.74] equally threatening
[1462.74 → 1463.34] in my opinion
[1463.34 → 1464.94] is distraction
[1464.94 → 1465.86] and when I say
[1465.86 → 1466.30] distraction
[1466.30 → 1466.96] I do mean
[1466.96 → 1467.66] screens
[1467.66 → 1468.68] it may be true
[1468.68 → 1469.46] for some of us
[1469.46 → 1470.02] we're running
[1470.02 → 1470.38] at a pace
[1470.38 → 1471.12] that's not sustainable
[1471.12 → 1471.76] and our homes
[1471.76 → 1472.34] are suffering
[1472.34 → 1473.00] as a result
[1473.00 → 1473.76] of that busyness
[1473.76 → 1474.72] our schedules
[1474.72 → 1475.54] are way too full
[1475.54 → 1475.96] and we're not
[1475.96 → 1476.64] present in our homes
[1476.64 → 1477.22] but I think
[1477.22 → 1477.98] it's also true
[1477.98 → 1478.62] that you can
[1478.62 → 1479.36] come home
[1479.36 → 1480.64] and still not
[1480.64 → 1481.12] connect
[1481.12 → 1481.66] and be in
[1481.66 → 1482.66] meaningful relationship
[1482.66 → 1484.46] because of distraction
[1484.46 → 1485.36] and screens
[1485.36 → 1486.18] right
[1486.18 → 1487.60] you've got one person
[1487.60 → 1488.18] in your household
[1488.18 → 1489.04] in this bedroom
[1489.04 → 1489.60] and they're watching
[1489.60 → 1490.06] their screen
[1490.06 → 1490.68] you've got someone
[1490.68 → 1491.10] downstairs
[1491.10 → 1491.80] watching something
[1491.80 → 1492.18] on TV
[1492.18 → 1492.86] someone in the kitchen
[1492.86 → 1493.74] table on their iPad
[1493.74 → 1494.50] someone texting
[1494.50 → 1495.00] with their friends
[1495.00 → 1495.58] in another room
[1495.58 → 1496.36] they come out
[1496.36 → 1497.20] briefly to grab
[1497.20 → 1497.58] the meal
[1497.58 → 1498.62] reheat it in the microwave
[1498.62 → 1499.58] off they trot
[1499.58 → 1500.44] back to the room
[1500.44 → 1501.80] in total isolation
[1501.80 → 1502.34] from the rest
[1502.34 → 1502.88] of the family
[1502.88 → 1504.54] that's real
[1504.54 → 1506.40] and there could be
[1506.40 → 1506.66] a sense
[1506.66 → 1507.24] we're all in the
[1507.24 → 1507.54] household
[1507.54 → 1508.32] but no one's
[1508.32 → 1508.72] talking
[1508.72 → 1509.74] no one's checking in
[1509.74 → 1510.54] no one's having
[1510.54 → 1511.72] a real conversation
[1511.72 → 1512.46] with other members
[1512.46 → 1512.96] of the family
[1512.96 → 1513.48] or roommates
[1513.48 → 1515.26] this is a serious
[1515.26 → 1515.66] threat
[1515.66 → 1516.70] and as I've listened
[1516.70 → 1517.26] to you
[1517.26 → 1518.36] and all of us
[1518.36 → 1519.04] in our church
[1519.04 → 1519.84] I've realized
[1519.84 → 1520.32] it's not just
[1520.32 → 1520.82] my household
[1520.82 → 1521.26] that struggles
[1521.26 → 1521.78] with this
[1521.78 → 1523.26] this is like
[1523.26 → 1524.12] a pandemic
[1524.12 → 1525.06] if you want
[1525.06 → 1526.02] to use that language
[1526.02 → 1528.52] and what breaks
[1528.52 → 1529.08] my heart
[1529.08 → 1531.34] is that we can
[1531.34 → 1531.72] know it
[1531.72 → 1532.54] and still do nothing
[1532.54 → 1534.10] really
[1534.10 → 1535.26] the hardest
[1535.26 → 1535.74] conversations
[1535.74 → 1536.28] sometimes like
[1536.28 → 1536.64] oh yeah
[1536.64 → 1537.46] this is a problem
[1537.46 → 1537.90] I know
[1537.90 → 1538.58] my kids are addicted
[1538.58 → 1539.18] to the devices
[1539.18 → 1540.00] I've got way too much
[1540.00 → 1540.90] work email on my phone
[1540.90 → 1541.40] but you know
[1541.40 → 1542.28] that's how it goes
[1542.28 → 1542.98] really
[1542.98 → 1544.94] that's how we respond
[1544.94 → 1545.54] to the challenges
[1545.54 → 1546.02] of our home
[1546.02 → 1547.12] yeah it's a problem
[1547.12 → 1548.02] we probably should have
[1548.02 → 1548.94] a conversation about it
[1548.94 → 1549.82] and in the meantime
[1549.82 → 1550.92] you've got people
[1550.92 → 1552.10] addicted to technology
[1552.10 → 1552.74] isolated
[1552.74 → 1553.60] without their friends
[1553.60 → 1554.76] and all the studies
[1554.76 → 1555.90] are in by the way
[1555.90 → 1557.22] all the studies are in
[1557.22 → 1558.20] not even done by Christians
[1558.20 → 1558.80] who have a vision
[1558.80 → 1559.20] of a home
[1559.20 → 1559.76] they're saying
[1559.76 → 1560.58] the dopamine's
[1560.58 → 1561.12] killing you
[1561.12 → 1562.38] your kids are lonely
[1562.38 → 1563.40] they're not relating
[1563.40 → 1563.96] to their family
[1563.96 → 1564.56] all they want to do
[1564.56 → 1565.10] is be with you
[1565.10 → 1565.74] but you're too busy
[1565.74 → 1566.58] with your work email
[1566.58 → 1567.40] like seriously
[1567.40 → 1569.28] to not do anything
[1569.28 → 1569.96] and knowing that
[1569.96 → 1570.76] is unbelievable
[1570.76 → 1572.68] and again
[1572.68 → 1573.04] I'm preaching
[1573.04 → 1573.80] to my own family
[1573.80 → 1575.88] we have to deal
[1575.88 → 1576.64] with our screens
[1576.64 → 1578.08] we have to deal
[1578.08 → 1579.16] with our distractions
[1579.16 → 1581.80] and the reality
[1581.80 → 1582.72] is if we do nothing
[1582.72 → 1584.80] and we're not attentive
[1584.80 → 1585.24] to the way
[1585.24 → 1586.10] that they're pulling us
[1586.10 → 1587.20] apart from each other
[1587.20 → 1588.56] we can have houses
[1588.56 → 1589.58] that are not homes
[1589.58 → 1591.28] you can have a house
[1591.28 → 1592.08] that's not a home
[1592.08 → 1592.82] you see the difference
[1592.82 → 1594.64] or you can have
[1594.64 → 1595.18] an acquaintance
[1595.18 → 1596.02] that never becomes
[1596.02 → 1596.50] a friend
[1596.50 → 1597.58] or a marriage
[1597.58 → 1597.92] that lives
[1597.92 → 1599.28] in perpetual distance
[1599.28 → 1600.60] without real intimacy
[1600.60 → 1601.82] or children
[1601.82 → 1602.52] where you're not
[1602.52 → 1603.34] really forming
[1603.34 → 1603.82] or teaching
[1603.82 → 1604.76] but living at a distance
[1604.76 → 1605.30] and you're parenting
[1605.30 → 1606.14] is lacklustre
[1606.14 → 1607.24] and is that the vision
[1607.24 → 1608.24] we have for our homes
[1608.24 → 1609.78] because these things
[1609.78 → 1610.74] are now the norm
[1610.74 → 1612.70] and I really do believe
[1612.70 → 1613.26] that our obedience
[1613.26 → 1613.74] to Jesus
[1613.74 → 1614.72] causes us to ask
[1614.72 → 1615.40] the hard question
[1615.40 → 1615.62] saying
[1615.62 → 1616.74] this is the mould
[1616.74 → 1617.66] we're growing up with
[1617.66 → 1618.74] it's not Colossi
[1618.74 → 1619.68] it's not Rome
[1619.68 → 1621.42] how are we allowing
[1621.42 → 1622.34] the good news of Jesus
[1622.34 → 1623.98] to transform the space
[1623.98 → 1624.70] that we live in
[1624.70 → 1625.22] sleep in
[1625.22 → 1626.36] and break bread in
[1626.36 → 1631.00] a few years ago
[1631.00 → 1631.52] there's an author
[1631.52 → 1632.54] by the name of David Fitch
[1632.54 → 1633.04] who wrote a book
[1633.04 → 1634.24] called Faithful Presence
[1634.24 → 1635.56] and if you're a reader
[1635.56 → 1636.50] I do commend it to you
[1636.50 → 1637.62] it's a very good book
[1637.62 → 1638.26] not just on
[1638.26 → 1639.80] this particular topic
[1639.80 → 1640.42] but what it means
[1640.42 → 1641.06] to be a church
[1641.06 → 1641.76] that is present
[1641.76 → 1642.54] to the world
[1642.54 → 1644.20] and this is what he writes
[1644.20 → 1645.06] as he's grappling
[1645.06 → 1645.64] with children
[1645.64 → 1646.46] his own son
[1646.46 → 1647.24] and his own life
[1647.24 → 1647.90] as an academic
[1647.90 → 1648.70] but when he read this
[1648.70 → 1649.20] I'm like yes
[1649.20 → 1650.26] this is true
[1650.26 → 1651.86] he writes
[1651.86 → 1652.64] our children
[1652.64 → 1653.72] are the casualties
[1653.72 → 1654.86] of a crazy
[1654.86 → 1655.60] confusing
[1655.60 → 1656.76] frenzied society
[1656.76 → 1658.14] and I know
[1658.14 → 1658.98] we feel that
[1658.98 → 1661.00] they are cast adrift
[1661.00 → 1661.78] from the moorings
[1661.78 → 1662.50] of relationships
[1662.50 → 1663.18] at home
[1663.18 → 1664.16] church
[1664.16 → 1665.44] and in the neighbourhood
[1665.44 → 1667.06] as the children
[1667.06 → 1668.02] shuffle from one
[1668.02 → 1668.86] scrubbed program
[1668.86 → 1669.50] to another
[1669.50 → 1670.76] their souls
[1670.76 → 1671.70] are pushed
[1671.70 → 1672.38] and pulled
[1672.38 → 1674.26] looking for the right
[1674.26 → 1675.44] path to direct
[1675.44 → 1676.06] their passions
[1676.06 → 1677.74] they are waiting
[1677.74 → 1678.62] to be drawn
[1678.62 → 1679.24] to a place
[1679.24 → 1680.20] worthy of their trust
[1680.20 → 1681.28] they are longing
[1681.28 → 1681.90] to know
[1681.90 → 1682.62] and to be known
[1682.62 → 1683.92] the world is obsessed
[1683.92 → 1684.66] with its children
[1684.66 → 1685.58] meanwhile
[1685.58 → 1687.08] the children
[1687.08 → 1688.14] want
[1688.14 → 1689.44] presence
[1689.44 → 1691.72] real
[1691.72 → 1693.44] presence
[1693.44 → 1695.72] what do you think
[1695.72 → 1696.02] of that
[1696.02 → 1700.82] just this week
[1700.82 → 1701.40] I was at soccer
[1701.40 → 1702.16] with my kids
[1702.16 → 1702.82] and I was struck
[1702.82 → 1703.76] by how a number
[1703.76 → 1704.46] of kids were scoring
[1704.46 → 1704.88] goals
[1704.88 → 1706.24] and so often
[1706.24 → 1706.88] if you're a parent
[1706.88 → 1707.76] you're at the soccer game
[1707.76 → 1708.42] you know how this goes
[1708.42 → 1709.44] they look over to the side
[1709.44 → 1709.96] and what's happening
[1709.96 → 1710.46] on the side
[1710.46 → 1712.38] the parent's sitting there
[1712.38 → 1713.22] with their device
[1713.22 → 1714.26] and I've done this
[1714.26 → 1714.98] so don't feel like
[1714.98 → 1715.58] I'm judging on you
[1715.58 → 1716.06] I've done this
[1716.06 → 1717.48] and the kid catches eyes
[1717.48 → 1718.10] and they realize
[1718.10 → 1718.82] the parent didn't see
[1718.82 → 1719.28] their goal
[1719.28 → 1720.12] and I thought
[1720.12 → 1721.38] how often does this happen
[1721.38 → 1722.44] in every sphere
[1722.44 → 1723.82] of society
[1723.82 → 1725.16] where there's a celebration
[1725.16 → 1726.14] there's something going on
[1726.14 → 1727.48] and it's not even seen
[1727.48 → 1728.94] let alone acknowledged
[1728.94 → 1729.40] and celebrated
[1729.40 → 1730.44] it's not even seen
[1730.44 → 1732.28] because we're so glued
[1732.28 → 1733.08] to our screens
[1733.08 → 1734.38] what will it take
[1734.38 → 1735.66] for Christians to say
[1735.66 → 1736.12] you know what
[1736.12 → 1737.68] that has to change
[1737.68 → 1738.30] in our home
[1738.30 → 1739.96] that has to change
[1739.96 → 1741.30] we can't be those
[1741.30 → 1741.90] who just sort of
[1741.90 → 1742.62] muddle our way
[1742.62 → 1743.08] through life
[1743.08 → 1744.04] and we never have
[1744.04 → 1744.94] meaningful relationships
[1744.94 → 1746.98] we're completely addicted
[1746.98 → 1747.58] to our screens
[1747.58 → 1748.54] not to mention
[1748.54 → 1750.04] allow all the destructive
[1750.04 → 1750.68] content
[1750.68 → 1752.76] to destroy our souls
[1752.76 → 1755.72] I realize this is
[1755.72 → 1756.70] a high intensity sermon
[1756.70 → 1757.90] but I think it needs to be
[1757.90 → 1759.24] because these are
[1759.24 → 1760.20] the real threats
[1760.20 → 1762.44] that really do undo
[1762.44 → 1763.54] the harmony
[1763.54 → 1764.38] and the shalom
[1764.38 → 1765.58] of the home
[1765.58 → 1769.18] and I'm convinced
[1769.18 → 1770.24] that if Paul were to
[1770.24 → 1770.84] write this letter
[1770.84 → 1771.70] to our church today
[1771.70 → 1772.26] he would have some
[1772.26 → 1773.26] strong words
[1773.26 → 1774.12] about schedules
[1774.12 → 1775.58] the frenzied nature
[1775.58 → 1776.38] of our households
[1776.38 → 1777.56] the way in which
[1777.56 → 1778.44] it's undoing
[1778.44 → 1779.34] our peace
[1779.34 → 1779.96] in the home
[1779.96 → 1780.78] the way it's keeping us
[1780.78 → 1781.74] from clothing ourselves
[1781.74 → 1782.38] with Christ
[1782.38 → 1783.46] and he would have
[1783.46 → 1784.16] some hard words
[1784.16 → 1784.70] for us
[1784.70 → 1787.12] but now
[1787.12 → 1788.06] I want to ask
[1788.06 → 1789.44] how do we sort of
[1789.44 → 1790.42] step forward in this
[1790.42 → 1790.76] and then
[1790.76 → 1791.96] what does it mean
[1791.96 → 1792.72] for us to be servants
[1792.72 → 1793.60] at this moment
[1793.60 → 1795.26] our cultural moment
[1795.26 → 1797.20] perhaps
[1797.20 → 1798.66] for you
[1798.66 → 1799.76] the first step
[1799.76 → 1801.16] towards serving
[1801.16 → 1801.84] in your home
[1801.84 → 1804.08] is leaving work
[1804.08 → 1804.60] at work
[1804.60 → 1806.22] it's leaving your
[1806.22 → 1807.24] work laptop
[1807.24 → 1808.08] in the office
[1808.08 → 1809.24] it's taking work email
[1809.24 → 1810.02] off your phone
[1810.02 → 1810.84] and if you haven't
[1810.84 → 1811.46] heard me speak about
[1811.46 → 1812.18] this in our church
[1812.18 → 1813.42] I'm a strong advocate
[1813.42 → 1814.24] of what we call
[1814.24 → 1815.00] the dumb phone
[1815.00 → 1815.78] this is originally
[1815.78 → 1816.90] coined by John Mark Coleman
[1816.90 → 1817.44] in a book called
[1817.44 → 1818.74] A Ruthless Elimination
[1818.74 → 1819.10] of Hurry
[1819.10 → 1819.56] but he says
[1819.56 → 1820.22] get social media
[1820.22 → 1820.84] off your phone
[1820.84 → 1821.74] do it today
[1821.74 → 1822.90] completely
[1822.90 → 1824.06] get social media
[1824.06 → 1824.62] off your phone
[1824.62 → 1826.04] get work email
[1826.04 → 1826.70] off your phone
[1826.70 → 1827.18] and then
[1827.18 → 1828.02] the hard step
[1828.02 → 1828.38] for everybody
[1828.38 → 1828.92] get internet
[1828.92 → 1829.58] off your phone
[1829.58 → 1830.62] and I'm now
[1830.62 → 1831.24] two years
[1831.24 → 1831.66] three years
[1831.66 → 1832.14] into it
[1832.14 → 1833.22] it's amazing
[1833.22 → 1833.60] and I know
[1833.60 → 1834.16] a number of families
[1834.16 → 1834.68] in our church
[1834.68 → 1835.38] parents in our church
[1835.38 → 1835.86] who have done it
[1835.86 → 1836.96] no one has come back
[1836.96 → 1837.50] to me and said
[1837.50 → 1837.98] oh man
[1837.98 → 1838.36] I just
[1838.36 → 1840.18] I have to bring it
[1840.18 → 1840.86] all back on my phone
[1840.86 → 1841.60] everyone who's done it
[1841.60 → 1842.32] so far
[1842.32 → 1843.34] has said
[1843.34 → 1844.66] this has been liberating
[1844.66 → 1846.06] and it's led to me
[1846.06 → 1846.78] being more present
[1846.78 → 1847.26] at home
[1847.26 → 1848.16] and when you get home
[1848.16 → 1849.40] you take that phone
[1849.40 → 1850.36] and you put it far away
[1850.36 → 1851.14] from the kitchen table
[1851.14 → 1852.32] and then you get to that table
[1852.32 → 1853.84] and you are present
[1853.84 → 1854.90] and accounted for
[1854.90 → 1856.36] you're ready to talk
[1856.36 → 1857.08] ready to listen
[1857.08 → 1858.18] ready to be a parent
[1858.18 → 1859.20] ready to be a child
[1859.20 → 1860.88] ready to be connected
[1860.88 → 1861.72] in real time
[1861.72 → 1862.96] in real relationship
[1862.96 → 1864.26] around the table
[1864.26 → 1867.52] the first step
[1867.52 → 1868.26] for many of us
[1868.26 → 1868.90] is drawing some
[1868.90 → 1870.10] very hard boundaries
[1870.10 → 1871.56] around our homes
[1871.56 → 1873.54] and if that means
[1873.54 → 1874.18] stepping down
[1874.18 → 1874.72] from a ministry
[1874.72 → 1875.26] at the church
[1875.26 → 1876.90] let's talk about that
[1876.90 → 1877.66] because there's never
[1877.66 → 1878.16] a moment
[1878.16 → 1879.24] where it's acceptable
[1879.24 → 1879.80] for pastors
[1879.80 → 1880.34] to push you
[1880.34 → 1881.02] into ministries
[1881.02 → 1881.60] into volunteering
[1881.60 → 1881.96] at the church
[1881.96 → 1882.52] if it means
[1882.52 → 1882.88] you're putting
[1882.88 → 1883.40] your family
[1883.40 → 1884.52] and your home
[1884.52 → 1885.06] on the altar
[1885.06 → 1886.42] we'll figure it out
[1886.42 → 1887.12] don't quit
[1887.12 → 1887.90] on everything today
[1887.90 → 1890.20] but we'll figure it out
[1890.20 → 1891.60] all of a sudden
[1891.60 → 1892.20] it's just me
[1892.20 → 1893.04] all by myself
[1893.04 → 1893.46] at church
[1893.46 → 1895.74] you get what I'm saying
[1895.74 → 1897.54] perhaps
[1897.54 → 1898.70] the first step
[1898.70 → 1899.20] for you
[1899.20 → 1900.56] in serving
[1900.56 → 1901.34] in your home
[1901.34 → 1902.98] is recovering
[1902.98 → 1903.66] a meal
[1903.66 → 1905.60] and I haven't read
[1905.60 → 1906.52] recent stats on this
[1906.52 → 1906.90] but I know
[1906.90 → 1907.40] in the states
[1907.40 → 1908.64] that the studies
[1908.64 → 1909.46] on how many people
[1909.46 → 1909.90] actually have
[1909.90 → 1910.80] a family meal
[1910.80 → 1911.94] is staggeringly low
[1911.94 → 1913.08] I mean the states
[1913.08 → 1913.76] is where they invented
[1913.76 → 1914.58] the TV dinner
[1914.58 → 1915.48] think about that
[1915.48 → 1916.58] the TV dinner
[1916.58 → 1917.30] where you actually
[1917.30 → 1917.98] don't share a meal
[1917.98 → 1918.66] you actually sit
[1918.66 → 1919.38] beside one another
[1919.38 → 1919.80] and you watch
[1919.80 → 1920.82] that big blue screen
[1920.82 → 1921.22] together
[1921.22 → 1922.28] that's a phenomenon
[1922.28 → 1923.14] that historians
[1923.14 → 1923.46] will say
[1923.46 → 1924.04] yeah that's when
[1924.04 → 1925.54] families really forgot
[1925.54 → 1925.92] what it meant
[1925.92 → 1926.66] to have a meal together
[1926.66 → 1928.98] that's all of us
[1928.98 → 1929.70] I think we need
[1929.70 → 1930.10] to recover
[1930.10 → 1930.54] what it means
[1930.54 → 1931.10] to get rid
[1931.10 → 1931.68] of the devices
[1931.68 → 1932.96] carve out the time
[1932.96 → 1933.74] you sit down
[1933.74 → 1934.20] and you actually
[1934.20 → 1934.78] eat that meal
[1934.78 → 1935.20] together
[1935.20 → 1935.76] it's warm
[1935.76 → 1936.08] you don't have
[1936.08 → 1936.52] to reheat it
[1936.52 → 1936.80] and bring it
[1936.80 → 1937.24] to your room
[1937.24 → 1937.94] you're together
[1937.94 → 1939.94] I think for many
[1939.94 → 1940.16] of us
[1940.16 → 1940.60] that might be
[1940.60 → 1941.18] a first step
[1941.18 → 1941.86] towards serving
[1941.86 → 1942.58] in our homes
[1942.58 → 1944.60] but more than that
[1944.60 → 1945.98] I think one of the
[1945.98 → 1946.62] ways that we serve
[1946.62 → 1947.30] with our homes
[1947.30 → 1948.50] and with our home
[1948.50 → 1949.06] space
[1949.06 → 1950.58] is hospitality
[1950.58 → 1952.98] homes in the first
[1952.98 → 1953.42] century were
[1953.42 → 1954.24] porous spaces
[1954.24 → 1954.98] where doors were
[1954.98 → 1955.32] open
[1955.32 → 1956.28] and there's a lot
[1956.28 → 1956.74] of people that
[1956.74 → 1957.18] were outside
[1957.18 → 1957.64] the quote unquote
[1957.64 → 1958.52] nuclear family
[1958.52 → 1959.20] that were welcome
[1959.20 → 1960.16] and shared meals
[1960.16 → 1961.04] and I know who's
[1961.04 → 1961.72] been in sort of
[1961.72 → 1962.78] Middle Eastern places
[1962.78 → 1963.18] you'll know
[1963.18 → 1963.96] and Latin American
[1963.96 → 1964.40] as well
[1964.40 → 1965.74] where there's a sense
[1965.74 → 1966.26] of hospitality
[1966.26 → 1967.16] that just pervades
[1967.16 → 1967.60] the culture
[1967.60 → 1968.36] that's not the case
[1968.36 → 1969.10] so much in the West
[1969.10 → 1969.90] but we need to
[1969.90 → 1971.64] recover real hospitality
[1971.64 → 1974.38] in my sermon this week
[1974.38 → 1975.22] I was thinking a lot
[1975.22 → 1975.90] about you know
[1975.90 → 1976.44] people who aren't
[1976.44 → 1977.28] in the stereotypical
[1977.28 → 1978.04] North American
[1978.04 → 1979.18] nuclear family
[1979.18 → 1980.40] I was thinking
[1980.40 → 1981.06] about singles
[1981.06 → 1982.32] people who live
[1982.32 → 1983.26] in dorms with
[1983.26 → 1983.74] friends
[1983.74 → 1984.74] thinking about
[1984.74 → 1985.92] widows who used
[1985.92 → 1986.54] to have a spouse
[1986.54 → 1987.08] or people in the
[1987.08 → 1987.60] home or empty
[1987.60 → 1988.48] esters or even
[1988.48 → 1989.06] you know single
[1989.06 → 1989.50] parents
[1989.50 → 1990.60] there's a lot of
[1990.60 → 1991.16] people even in our
[1991.16 → 1991.88] own community this
[1991.88 → 1992.36] morning who were
[1992.36 → 1993.72] like okay some of
[1993.72 → 1994.30] this stuff is not
[1994.30 → 1995.06] really my story
[1995.06 → 1995.48] what does it look
[1995.48 → 1996.62] like for me to be a
[1996.62 → 1997.38] servant at home in
[1997.38 → 1998.22] this space at this
[1998.22 → 1998.54] time
[1998.54 → 2000.04] and I really do think
[2000.04 → 2001.36] hospitality is a big
[2001.36 → 2002.74] part of what that
[2002.74 → 2003.40] could look like
[2003.40 → 2004.54] let me tell you two
[2004.54 → 2005.02] stories
[2005.02 → 2007.20] first I was at
[2007.20 → 2007.68] Regent a couple
[2007.68 → 2008.34] weeks ago and I
[2008.34 → 2008.98] was talking to two
[2008.98 → 2009.60] students they're both
[2009.60 → 2009.94] from different
[2009.94 → 2010.70] countries but they
[2010.70 → 2011.96] both rented a room
[2011.96 → 2013.74] in a home of a
[2013.74 → 2014.50] family an Asian
[2014.50 → 2015.80] family and they
[2015.80 → 2016.74] had two young kids
[2016.74 → 2017.38] and then they rented
[2017.38 → 2018.28] two basement rooms
[2018.28 → 2019.04] to these students
[2019.04 → 2020.66] and this one student
[2020.66 → 2021.10] she was South
[2021.10 → 2021.82] African was just
[2021.82 → 2022.54] sharing how it was
[2022.54 → 2023.44] very you know it was
[2023.44 → 2024.56] a strange change for
[2024.56 → 2025.24] her to sort of rent
[2025.24 → 2026.08] from a family and
[2026.08 → 2026.86] and part of the
[2026.86 → 2027.60] renting was that they
[2027.60 → 2028.26] shared meals together
[2028.26 → 2029.00] with the family they
[2029.00 → 2029.84] got to know the kids
[2029.84 → 2030.70] they actually had
[2030.70 → 2031.52] times when in
[2031.52 → 2032.42] certain seasons they
[2032.42 → 2032.84] worked through the
[2032.84 → 2033.30] church calendar
[2033.30 → 2034.32] together they fasted
[2034.32 → 2035.60] together as she was
[2035.60 → 2036.44] describing how beautiful
[2036.44 → 2037.44] it was to sort of not
[2037.44 → 2038.78] be biological family
[2038.78 → 2039.90] but sort of be grafted
[2039.90 → 2042.14] into the family and of
[2042.14 → 2042.92] course these this
[2042.92 → 2043.64] family this young
[2043.64 → 2044.20] family had to make
[2044.20 → 2045.22] some sacrifices with
[2045.22 → 2046.12] you know the privacy
[2046.12 → 2047.28] or you know now
[2047.28 → 2048.16] they're on display when
[2048.16 → 2048.78] the kids are losing
[2048.78 → 2049.66] their minds and meal
[2049.66 → 2050.36] times going poorly
[2050.36 → 2050.94] there's these two
[2050.94 → 2051.60] students who are like
[2051.60 → 2053.00] okay here we are this
[2053.00 → 2055.80] is family meal now but
[2055.80 → 2056.64] they were grafted into
[2056.64 → 2059.06] the family similarly when
[2059.06 → 2060.52] I was a kid I grew up
[2060.52 → 2062.42] with an aunt Carol and I
[2062.42 → 2063.18] learned like I think
[2063.18 → 2063.98] after the first 10 years
[2063.98 → 2064.80] of my life she wasn't
[2064.80 → 2065.96] actually my biological
[2065.96 → 2067.48] aunt she was my mom's
[2067.48 → 2068.62] neighbour growing up and
[2068.62 → 2069.44] as long as I knew her
[2069.44 → 2070.48] she was a single mom in
[2070.48 → 2071.64] our neighbourhood but
[2071.64 → 2072.48] aunt Carol was at our
[2072.48 → 2073.66] birthdays in fact I
[2073.66 → 2074.54] loved when she came for
[2074.54 → 2075.20] her birthdays because she
[2075.20 → 2075.86] was the one who like
[2075.86 → 2077.34] taped the loonies to the
[2077.34 → 2079.70] card it was amazing as a
[2079.70 → 2080.34] kid you know that's a
[2080.34 → 2082.08] great practice then when
[2082.08 → 2083.32] you turn 10 you get a
[2083.32 → 2084.76] know a bill anyway aside
[2084.76 → 2086.70] from the benefits' aunt Carol
[2086.70 → 2088.46] a single mom invited our
[2088.46 → 2090.64] family over to have meals
[2090.64 → 2091.68] and I come from a family
[2091.68 → 2093.38] of seven with five boys and
[2093.38 → 2094.42] so for her having us over
[2094.42 → 2095.24] is like you know get rid
[2095.24 → 2096.54] of the china you know
[2096.54 → 2097.58] tape down the dangerous
[2097.58 → 2098.30] glass that they're gonna
[2098.30 → 2099.56] break, and she had us in
[2099.56 → 2101.52] her home and she was part
[2101.52 → 2103.10] of our home and I think
[2103.10 → 2104.32] that's a vision for
[2104.32 → 2105.44] hospitality that we need to
[2105.44 → 2106.50] recover in the church
[2106.50 → 2108.32] where there's this porous
[2108.32 → 2109.52] sense of moving from home
[2109.52 → 2111.10] to home being family with
[2111.10 → 2111.72] people who aren't your
[2111.72 → 2112.72] quote-unquote biological
[2112.72 → 2114.46] family and recognizing that
[2114.46 → 2116.66] our doors are open and our
[2116.66 → 2117.88] tables are ready for more
[2117.88 → 2120.00] chairs and all of us can
[2120.00 → 2120.76] make steps in that
[2120.76 → 2121.86] direction to learn how to
[2121.86 → 2124.46] make family a wider network
[2124.46 → 2126.08] of brothers and sisters in
[2126.08 → 2128.54] Christ even strangers I
[2128.54 → 2134.32] should add what does it
[2134.32 → 2135.02] mean for you to be a
[2135.02 → 2136.96] kingdom servant in your
[2136.96 → 2139.08] home what's percolating as
[2139.08 → 2140.30] you hear Paul speak to this
[2140.30 → 2142.90] church in Colossians the
[2142.90 → 2144.06] most important thing for
[2144.06 → 2145.58] Paul that's underwriting all
[2145.58 → 2146.84] of what he's saying in this
[2146.84 → 2148.36] letter is that the freedom
[2148.36 → 2149.66] the church has in Jesus the
[2149.66 → 2151.12] freedom they did not earn by
[2151.12 → 2152.08] obedience the freedom that
[2152.08 → 2153.14] Jesus accomplished on the
[2153.14 → 2154.86] cross that must be tasted and
[2154.86 → 2156.98] experienced in the home it's
[2156.98 → 2158.14] not some sort of hypothetical
[2158.14 → 2159.48] thing up there Paul wants
[2159.48 → 2162.74] them to know existentially what
[2162.74 → 2164.28] it means to be free in their
[2164.28 → 2166.28] homes husbands wives parents
[2166.28 → 2170.26] children roommates etc that can
[2170.26 → 2172.14] be tasted, and he wants this
[2172.14 → 2173.86] church to take baby step after
[2173.86 → 2176.00] baby step recognizing that Jesus
[2176.00 → 2177.40] lives in their home the spirit
[2177.40 → 2180.16] dwells in their home and is on to
[2180.16 → 2181.90] bring them freedom in their
[2181.90 → 2183.68] home the kind of freedom that
[2183.68 → 2184.92] causes neighbours to say why do
[2184.92 → 2187.00] they live that way why are they
[2187.00 → 2188.50] having people over all the time
[2188.50 → 2190.36] for meals why are they raising
[2190.36 → 2192.24] kids differently there's something
[2192.24 → 2193.56] different about this home and the
[2193.56 → 2196.30] answer to that is the gospel of
[2196.30 → 2199.62] Jesus setting people free and
[2199.62 → 2202.36] bearing witness to the freedom that
[2202.36 → 2208.14] Jesus does bring in a moment we're
[2208.14 → 2209.36] going to celebrate the Lord's
[2209.36 → 2211.54] supper together, and it seems
[2211.54 → 2212.76] appropriate to me that we take
[2212.76 → 2214.46] some time in prayerful preparation
[2214.46 → 2217.34] I know that a sermon like this can
[2217.34 → 2218.74] sometimes bring some conviction or
[2218.74 → 2220.32] perhaps guilt whatever it is I
[2220.32 → 2221.26] don't know what's stirring in you
[2221.26 → 2222.70] but I want you to bring that into
[2222.70 → 2224.80] prayer Jesus knows what it is and
[2224.80 → 2226.36] Jesus our gracious Saviour is
[2226.36 → 2228.40] present to us this morning so bring
[2228.40 → 2230.34] the broken pieces bring the
[2230.34 → 2231.48] frustration you have with your own
[2231.48 → 2233.28] character bring whatever your home
[2233.28 → 2234.74] life needs prayer for into prayer
[2234.74 → 2237.06] before Christ and then we together
[2237.06 → 2239.42] will heartily and readily go to the
[2239.42 → 2241.72] table of grace together that sound
[2241.72 → 2243.92] good join me in prayer
[2243.92 → 2251.04] father we thank you that you're here
[2251.04 → 2253.96] and not just that you're here but
[2253.96 → 2257.18] you're in our homes, and we pause and
[2257.18 → 2258.32] want to start this prayer by
[2258.32 → 2261.76] recognizing that you live in our
[2261.76 → 2264.98] homes and all the mess you see all
[2264.98 → 2266.34] the hard pieces you see all the
[2266.34 → 2267.68] brokenness you see and that you
[2267.68 → 2270.96] abide with us by your grace and so
[2270.96 → 2272.90] receive the prayers we bring to you
[2272.90 → 2274.88] as we prepare to celebrate the meal
