[0.00 --> 8.66]  well good morning hope it is good to be together and gather around the word again this sunday in
[8.66 --> 14.82]  our homes and we're going to jump right back into our series on apprenticing with jesus looking at
[14.82 --> 21.14]  the question what does it mean when jesus invites us and says to the church follow me here in canada
[21.14 --> 28.36]  here in british columbia here in clayton heights and i want to just comment on a statement pastor
[28.36 --> 34.38]  sid made last week actually someone texted this statement last week to me he said a lot of
[34.38 --> 37.38]  important things especially about the role of being a pastor but this is one of the things he
[37.38 --> 44.82]  said that stands i don't want to share it again he said without the gospel story i am just a slave
[44.82 --> 52.16]  i want to in my preaching tell the story of how jesus liberated me from that slavery that's a
[52.16 --> 58.08]  powerful statement about conversion a powerful statement about apprenticing with jesus
[58.08 --> 66.08]  and as sid mentioned apprenticing with jesus is being liberated by jesus it is jesus by his grace
[66.08 --> 71.00]  and his power pulling us out of the power of sin under its weight pulling us out from the idols
[71.00 --> 77.08]  we serve pulling us out from the false idolatrous stories that we live in and this morning we're
[77.08 --> 83.20]  going to hone in on the way in which apprenticing with jesus is resisting cultural patterns it's being
[83.20 --> 89.70]  pulled into a better story with a better savior so for that i do invite you to turn to the passage
[89.70 --> 96.08]  sonia already mentioned that's romans 12 1 and 2 and for anyone who likes memorizing scripture this is
[96.08 --> 101.44]  one of those passages that i encourage you to memorize this is god's word for the church this
[101.44 --> 109.18]  morning romans 12 1 and 2 therefore i urge you brothers and sisters in view of god's mercy to offer
[109.18 --> 118.20]  your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to god this is true worship do not conform to the
[118.20 --> 124.48]  patterns of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you'll be able to test
[124.48 --> 130.68]  and approve what god's will is his good pleasing and perfect will
[130.68 --> 138.06]  i mentioned to val this week that i see four sermons in this passage and i only get to preach
[138.06 --> 144.04]  one of them this morning a number of years ago i had a chance to go to india with a friend of mine
[144.04 --> 149.58]  remember those days when we could get on planes and fly places and it was one of those special trips
[149.58 --> 153.76]  where i was able to spend a whole week in a completely different culture in fact i've never
[153.76 --> 158.88]  been anywhere where i felt further away from canada not just in terms of geography but also in terms of
[158.88 --> 165.00]  culture the streets the city the architecture the dress the food the temples that line the streets
[165.00 --> 170.92]  where i was it was so different than canadian culture here but the highlight for both of us who
[170.92 --> 176.22]  went was spending time with a group of university and graduate students who became christians many
[176.22 --> 181.76]  of whom not that long ago and we got to hear the stories for several days what made them become
[181.76 --> 186.56]  believers and most of them the vast majority of them grew up in hindu families in a hindu context
[186.56 --> 191.70]  culture and we got to hear how they heard christ speak and how they came to faith in this person
[191.70 --> 201.14]  named jesus but equally impacting to me was hearing them struggle with how then to live in their families
[201.14 --> 207.00]  hindu families in their academic institutions with their friendships there seemed to be no part of
[207.00 --> 212.52]  their life where they weren't struggling with okay now i'm a disciple of jesus living in this
[212.52 --> 219.90]  network of relationships in this culture that's very hindu how do i practice my faith here what does
[219.90 --> 224.30]  it mean for me as a student what does it mean for me as a friend what does it mean for me and my family
[224.30 --> 229.36]  and there's a sense in which they felt more and more that there's this mold they grew up in the hindu
[229.36 --> 236.58]  mold this culture around them and now they had broken out of that by jesus and they were struggling with how
[236.58 --> 245.06]  to live in that culture as apprentices of jesus flying back to canada i could not help but feel
[245.06 --> 249.92]  especially as i was discipling a number of international students do we have the same kind
[249.92 --> 255.08]  of struggle as we come to faith here in canada as we grow in faith here in canada do we have that
[255.08 --> 260.50]  same sense of struggle about how we've been broken free from the cultural mold and live distinctively
[260.50 --> 267.12]  as apprentices of jesus in a different story it seems to me one of the challenges that we face and
[267.12 --> 271.20]  i hear this from people who come to canada is the myth and i have to say this as often as i can the
[271.20 --> 277.52]  myth that canada is a christian culture that somehow it's favorable or neutral even towards a christian
[277.52 --> 284.42]  faith when it is most evidently not and i think many people when they think about conversion to
[284.42 --> 289.14]  christianity it's almost an image this is a strong image but it's how i feel sometimes we see ourselves
[289.14 --> 294.06]  sort of building our identity we've got a shopping cart we're going down the aisle of life and we're
[294.06 --> 298.24]  picking all these things that we want to make part of our identity so if you're an apple or android
[298.24 --> 302.28]  person you pick apple or android you put that in your cart that's part of your identity you're a
[302.28 --> 306.76]  chiefs fan or a buccaneers fan you put one of those teams in your cart that's part of your identity and
[306.76 --> 310.08]  then you sort of have to think okay well what faith is going to be part of my identity you pick
[310.08 --> 315.02]  christianity and it's one of those elements you add to your life that you build into your own
[315.02 --> 320.00]  identity or becomes another subtitle on your twitter handle sort of jesus follower with the praying
[320.00 --> 327.86]  hands but do we see it as a completely different way of inhabiting this world a lens through which
[327.86 --> 335.06]  you see every dimension of your human life differently is it something your christian faith that re-narrates
[335.06 --> 341.48]  the whole of your life because that's what apprenticeship is and that's what these indian students were
[341.48 --> 346.46]  struggling with as they came to faith recognizing that there's a mold that the culture was pressing
[346.46 --> 356.12]  them into and they no longer fit that mold because of christ do we see the canadian mold the canadian
[356.12 --> 365.42]  story the secular faith of the society that we grow up in do we see how institutions schools friendships
[365.42 --> 372.98]  all of societal life social media forms us in a certain way we see the world a certain way we
[372.98 --> 378.50]  imagine what it means to be human a certain way that's different from other places in other cultures in
[378.50 --> 382.14]  fact if you ever have hosted someone in your home or spent time with someone from a very different
[382.14 --> 390.18]  culture they will notice just how western you are do you realize that when you drive to work in the
[390.18 --> 396.66]  morning you're being discipled in all sorts of ways just this week i was driving up fraser highway and i
[396.66 --> 402.58]  was beside a bus near willowbrook mall and i saw on the side of that bus born to shop
[402.58 --> 408.90]  we're being discipled do you realize that when you open twitter or instagram or facebook and you're
[408.90 --> 415.22]  scrolling through you're being discipled your heart is trying to be grabbed by all sorts of voices
[415.22 --> 422.10]  shaping you into a certain person often a consumer at their will do you see how when you turn on the
[422.10 --> 427.08]  television later this afternoon for football the worst sport that you're going to be discipled in a
[427.08 --> 433.34]  variety of ways maybe not the worst sport there are worse sports i want to share with you just briefly
[433.34 --> 438.56]  an experience i had a number of years ago i'm not a football fan as you already know and i was in
[438.56 --> 444.12]  somewhere in the states on the west coast uh we were in san diego and we were at this giant football
[444.12 --> 448.12]  stadium two teams and we were sitting in a section of people where there are a lot of university
[448.12 --> 452.22]  students and by the way at football games as you fans will know there's like rituals there's like
[452.22 --> 457.12]  a liturgy with football and at the beginning of the game i was just fascinated by all that was
[457.12 --> 462.10]  happening they had the marching band on the field they had like soldiers on the field uh they had
[462.10 --> 466.00]  everyone stand up and sing the anthem and as they sung the anthem they stretched out like a zillion
[466.00 --> 471.86]  foot size american flag over the field all the people singing and then they had like an f-18 flying
[471.86 --> 478.66]  over i was looking around like this is crazy like this is discipleship this is identity formation
[478.66 --> 483.38]  about who you are as a person what does it mean to be at this game who you are as an american and we
[483.38 --> 490.10]  have the same things here in canada maybe just not as extreme with our football do you see how you
[490.10 --> 498.00]  are being discipled you are being formed into a cultural pattern to see the world inhabit the world
[498.00 --> 501.24]  and live in a certain vision of what it means to be human
[501.24 --> 510.34]  to a tiny little church and i do mean a tiny little church living in rome paul writes these
[510.34 --> 517.58]  incredibly powerful words it says therefore brothers and sisters i urge you in view of god's mercy to
[517.58 --> 523.92]  offer your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to god this is true worship
[523.92 --> 532.74]  do not conform to the patterns of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
[532.74 --> 539.18]  then you'll be able to test and approve what god's will is his good is pleasing and his perfect will
[539.18 --> 546.96]  now this passage has a movement to it it starts with in view of god's mercy the gospel of grace
[546.96 --> 552.50]  offering your whole life as an act of worship and in order for that to happen you have to one
[552.50 --> 557.98]  resist the patterns of culture the idolatrous ways that you're formed in ways that are not of christ
[557.98 --> 565.20]  and then learn and be transformed by the renewing of your mind which then results in discerning and
[565.20 --> 572.46]  living in god's good pleasing and perfect will but it begins with an invitation to give the whole of our
[572.46 --> 579.50]  lives to jesus as an act of worship and this by itself is a radical statement in the west i still think
[579.50 --> 585.80]  when i look around that we as christians often divide up our lives in strange ways that we do not
[585.80 --> 591.82]  see in this passage sort of the secular life over here the spiritual life over there the spiritual life
[591.82 --> 597.04]  has sunday morning it has some prayer time maybe youth group on monday or tuesday the secular life has
[597.04 --> 604.78]  school your work your time in the neighborhood your vacation life god manages this i manage that you live in
[604.78 --> 611.84]  this bifurcated life where you don't see every dimension every portion of time every hour of the
[611.84 --> 620.58]  day wherever you find yourself as an act of worship do we see the whole of our lives as worship that the
[620.58 --> 629.52]  lives we live in these bodies as an act of worship apprenticing with jesus is holding out before our
[629.52 --> 639.68]  father the entirety of life your marriage your leisure your time behind the screen your time with
[639.68 --> 646.36]  friends your hours at work that is an act of worship and i want to read for you a quote that comes from
[646.36 --> 651.50]  william barclay you'll notice just by how he speaks it's a few years old but i love this quote he says
[651.50 --> 656.68]  in the summary of paul's statement i think i have it on the screen for you paul's saying here take your
[656.68 --> 664.10]  body take all of the tasks that you have to do every day take the ordinary work of the shop the
[664.10 --> 671.22]  office the factory the shipyard the mine and offer all of that as an act of worship to god we might say
[671.22 --> 679.22]  i'm going to church to worship god but we should also say i'm going to the factory the shop the office
[679.22 --> 686.02]  the school the garage the mine the shipyard the field the cowshed the garden the laptop i would add
[686.02 --> 695.14]  to worship god do you see apprenticeship that way do you see the faith that we have in jesus as
[695.14 --> 701.40]  pulling us into this kind of life and for this to happen this is a critical point for this to happen
[701.40 --> 707.16]  we need to realize that every way we live in every part of society is shaped by some story
[707.16 --> 712.32]  the way you do your work the way you live with your friends the way you do your travel and leisure
[712.32 --> 718.84]  the way you do every piece of your life is shaped by some story and i could give tons of examples of
[718.84 --> 726.60]  how work is not shaped for many of us by the biblical story and jesus when he says follow me
[726.60 --> 733.80]  invites us to break the cultural way that we see how these things are done and inhabit these spaces
[733.80 --> 741.70]  these activities as apprentices following jesus serving god seeking first the kingdom
[741.70 --> 750.32]  now the church in rome to whom this letter was written they had a very similar experience of
[750.32 --> 756.36]  being a small community in a big culture that lived out of a different story and i want you to imagine
[756.36 --> 761.36]  them for a minute again they're a little community a brand new community in this big roman empire
[761.36 --> 768.26]  this empire was the most impressive of empires it had a very significant place in western history
[768.26 --> 772.82]  and there's a story that came with the roman empire people who grew up in this city they were
[772.82 --> 778.16]  forged in a certain way the same way that canadians are forged in a certain way in our cities they had
[778.16 --> 782.20]  a certain vision for what a city was about a certain vision for why they worked a certain understanding
[782.20 --> 788.02]  of their place in society and what life was all about and everything and i do mean this everything in
[788.02 --> 794.64]  roman society tailored towards this vision of rome the games the feasts the architecture
[794.64 --> 800.52]  all of it was shaping they had statues all over the city telling the story of all their military victories
[800.52 --> 806.78]  how it was so great to be in this city of rome how caesar should be worshipped and he was worshipped
[806.78 --> 808.36]  because he was a god
[808.36 --> 813.64]  this was all telling a story of what it means to be human
[813.64 --> 820.44]  what it means to live and enjoy the world as a good roman citizen and in the midst of this big roman
[820.44 --> 827.62]  story there's this church and these christians happen to have heard probably through evangelism
[827.62 --> 834.20]  through a variety of things the message of a different king a rabbi who walked around talking
[834.20 --> 840.66]  about the arrival of a different kingdom who spoke about a different story about god working in a
[840.66 --> 844.98]  different kind of way than romans would even understand the gods they saw this and heard
[844.98 --> 849.38]  about this rabbi who could heal and speak with authority teach with a different ethic on loving
[849.38 --> 855.04]  friends loving enemies loving neighbors and as they heard this message they were wooed by the power and
[855.04 --> 862.88]  authority with which it came and much to everyone's surprise this little group of people who at some
[862.88 --> 869.68]  point became called christians follower of the way followers of the way of jesus broke free from that roman mold
[869.68 --> 880.16]  they saw this big powerful pervasive roman story as a false story more than that they saw it as an enslaving
[880.16 --> 890.40]  story and jesus broke into these people's lives liberating them from all of its sin and bringing them into freedom
[890.40 --> 898.00]  i want to pause and emphasize that for all the christians then and christians in every generation
[898.00 --> 903.68]  in every city throughout the world that process of breaking free from the idolatrous story the lies of
[903.68 --> 910.08]  culture the power of sin and being liberated into the family of jesus is a slow often painful process
[911.28 --> 915.92]  of seeing how you've been formed in all sorts of conscious and unconscious ways to think like your
[915.92 --> 921.36]  culture thinks to practice and have habits like your culture has and be formed in ways that you now are trying
[921.36 --> 926.80]  to shift and together and we're going to talk about this the next couple weeks how is a community practice ways that
[926.80 --> 935.04]  steep and nurture one's heart and one's life in the way of the kingdom and this little roman church they had to
[935.04 --> 942.72]  unlearn bad habits of worshiping a human worshiping this caesar who would be killed and that's the end of it and they
[942.72 --> 947.60]  started learning how to feast in ways that honored god in fact they had to not participate in many
[947.60 --> 952.40]  practices of culture because they were so violent so explicit and they didn't learn new practices like
[952.40 --> 957.68]  communion where they gathered around a table to celebrate king jesus and all that he had done and
[957.68 --> 965.20]  accomplished the slow process of unlearning old habits being liberated into this new family that was actually
[965.20 --> 973.76]  flourishing as the way god intended from the beginning and as it happened they stood out as
[973.76 --> 977.92]  they followed the way of christ as they apprenticed with him and they learned to be like him do what he
[977.92 --> 982.96]  did they stood out from the roman story they didn't beat to the tune of the roman world they didn't live
[982.96 --> 988.48]  the way romans lived and people just could not figure out these christians in fact there's a lot of writing
[988.48 --> 992.80]  where writers and authors of the time were trying to figure out why they live the way they live
[992.80 --> 999.52]  i want to read for you a quote this comes from what's called the epistle of diognetus and we don't
[999.52 --> 1005.52]  know who wrote it but it was written in all likelihood to a man named diognetus who is suspicious
[1005.52 --> 1012.24]  or at the very best exploring and trying to make sense of the christians and i want to suggest to you
[1012.24 --> 1019.76]  before i read it that line by line whoever wrote this is doing incredible cultural contrast to the roman
[1019.76 --> 1024.88]  story and how the christians are living and i hope that as you hear it you'll see how it just speaks on
[1024.88 --> 1031.36]  so many levels to the church today this is what the epistle to diognetus says they the christians
[1031.92 --> 1039.12]  they dwell in their own countries but not simply or sorry but simply as sojourners as citizens they
[1039.12 --> 1045.28]  share in all things with others and yet they endure all things as if foreigners they marry as do all others
[1045.28 --> 1052.16]  they beget children but they do not destroy their offspring what a word and season they have a
[1052.16 --> 1060.24]  common table but not a common bed they are in the flesh but they do not live after the flesh they pass
[1060.24 --> 1066.56]  their days on earth but are citizens of heaven they obey the prescribed laws and at the same time surpass
[1066.56 --> 1074.64]  the laws in their lives they love all and are persecuted by all they are poor yet they are made make many rich
[1074.64 --> 1080.16]  they are completely destitute and yet they enjoy complete abundance they are reviled and yet they
[1080.16 --> 1086.80]  bless when they do good they are punished as evildoers undergoing punishment they rejoice because they're
[1086.80 --> 1091.84]  brought back to life isn't that a powerful quote
[1094.40 --> 1102.56]  what a statement to describe the church hey diognetus you want to make sense of the church this is how they
[1102.56 --> 1108.32]  live and if i had more time i'd show you line by line how all the ways they lived were just running
[1108.32 --> 1114.48]  against the grain of roman culture running against the grain of how people assumed you should live
[1114.48 --> 1121.44]  the good roman life and here's my question you ready for it could the same kind of letter be written
[1121.44 --> 1128.08]  to a diognetus of our day the one who's trying to make sense of the christians in west coast british
[1128.08 --> 1133.84]  columbia what would be said to them could we say things like what they're saying they live simply
[1134.72 --> 1139.84]  like sojourners they held their citizenship loosely because they were citizens of the kingdom
[1140.72 --> 1145.52]  they live simply could we say that these were the kind of people who practice a common table they
[1145.52 --> 1150.48]  broke bread with strangers and enemies they learned community that cut through social boundaries but they
[1150.48 --> 1159.36]  did not share their beds there is fidelity in the marriage covenant could we say these kinds of things
[1159.36 --> 1169.60]  of the church today have we stopped and thought about at a deep level what faithful non-conformity to
[1169.60 --> 1177.52]  our cultural patterns looks like for the church today how might the gospel be calling us to break the
[1177.52 --> 1183.28]  molds that we are currently living in even unconsciously in our daily canadian habits and
[1183.28 --> 1188.08]  i'll just ask a few questions that i hope prompt for conversation around your lunchroom table this
[1188.08 --> 1193.76]  afternoon or dinner table and i do invite you to have further conversation as families and couples
[1193.76 --> 1201.76]  and friends over what i'm about to ask how might the gospel just for starters how might apprenticing with jesus
[1201.76 --> 1211.44]  change the way you interact with social media how many change the way it shapes you if it's true that
[1211.44 --> 1217.60]  most of us spend upwards of 20 hours on social media each week how might an apprentice of jesus use
[1218.48 --> 1225.68]  and sort of renew the way these mediums and medias are used what's it look like for you is it a habit
[1225.68 --> 1231.20]  that's forging you in a certain way and how then as the apprentice do you faithfully engage with these media
[1232.08 --> 1239.76]  or how might as an apprentice of jesus you live in the academic world i am so convinced that the
[1239.76 --> 1245.12]  academic world is such a powerful apprenticing community and as students go to school and
[1245.12 --> 1251.84]  university how are we resisting the message of making your job first of all about just what you want to
[1251.84 --> 1257.44]  do how you can get a lot of money and live a comfortable life how do we make our academic life about
[1257.44 --> 1264.40]  growing our gifts serving the community and not first and foremost being preoccupied with money
[1265.52 --> 1271.52]  how are you apprenticing with jesus and resisting the cultural mold in the academic world
[1272.80 --> 1278.32]  or your work life let's talk about that i'm convinced that most of us when we walk into workplaces
[1278.32 --> 1282.24]  we're walking into a culture that's going to form us in a certain way and i don't know everyone's
[1282.24 --> 1286.08]  workplace but i know enough of our workplaces to know that there's sort of the corporate ladder
[1286.08 --> 1291.84]  there's the way in which you got to navigate the politics so you can be on top how might you as an
[1291.84 --> 1299.20]  apprentice break that mold and be someone who seeks to serve the kingdom of god and bless and love one's
[1299.20 --> 1308.48]  neighbor through that vocation how do we apprentice in our workplaces or how might we apprentice with jesus
[1308.48 --> 1315.28]  in our singleness in our marriage i'm struck by some of the comments that are made in this epistle to
[1315.28 --> 1321.68]  diognetus and how prophetic they speak now to the church today where now if you want to live any way
[1321.68 --> 1327.20]  you want in your sexual life that's for you to decide there is no authority above you you are the center
[1327.20 --> 1334.40]  in our culture how might the apprentice of jesus who gives us the way of life live singly live in
[1334.40 --> 1341.04]  a marriage relationship and honor god's creational design for these institutions and relationships
[1342.88 --> 1347.12]  james k smith who wrote a book called you are what you love which is a summary of a more complicated
[1347.12 --> 1353.12]  book he says that families should be having audits of their family life where you sort of walk through
[1353.12 --> 1357.04]  your weekly habits your monthly habits and just ask the question how am i being formed
[1357.20 --> 1363.04]  by these habits like what is my 30 hours of netflix doing to my soul how is it shaping my desires what
[1363.04 --> 1368.24]  vision of the human life is it giving me and someone just recently by the way described to me how netflix
[1368.24 --> 1372.56]  for them is a trojan horse it's always a story that you like and then at some point it becomes this
[1372.56 --> 1377.92]  cultural hijacking saying hey here's here's the priorities we want you to have as an individual western
[1377.92 --> 1384.88]  in person here's what really matters to us how do we apprentice with jesus in those places with these
[1384.88 --> 1391.92]  habits and what might faithful non-conformity look like i'm convinced we need to have more conversations
[1391.92 --> 1397.44]  not just as families not just as couples but as a church saying what does it look like for us to live
[1397.44 --> 1407.68]  and practice new things new ways as followers of jesus now to return to where i began pastor stood
[1407.68 --> 1414.24]  made that audacious comment that he without the gospel story would be a slave and i want to say
[1414.24 --> 1420.32]  differently now whenever jesus calls us into non-conformity with idolatrous cultural patterns he is inviting us to
[1420.32 --> 1425.84]  life there is this i think very false narrative that to become a christian is to say no to all the
[1425.84 --> 1430.48]  good things in life you sort of stay home while everyone's having the party and that is the opposite
[1430.48 --> 1437.12]  of what's happening when jesus invites us to follow him what's really happening is the lord of life is
[1437.12 --> 1443.60]  saying you will be destroyed by the idols of this culture in one way or another you'll be enslaved in
[1443.60 --> 1448.56]  ways you won't even be able to see and i'm inviting you to the life to the full
[1451.28 --> 1458.16]  and what's really happening in our culture is false offers of salvation a false story even every
[1458.16 --> 1462.32]  commercial i watch i'm so surprised at how often there's this implicit sometimes just straight up
[1462.32 --> 1469.04]  explicit offer of the good life through this purchase this lifestyle this thing this relationship
[1469.04 --> 1473.92]  i want to read a quote for you that we're reading in surge this comes from a book called the symphony
[1473.92 --> 1479.44]  of mission by mike goheen and jim mullins and jim mullins wrote this part and i just find this to
[1479.44 --> 1486.56]  sing very powerfully he writes culturally we've sought salvation in technologies that have certainly
[1486.56 --> 1492.00]  benefited the world but have never fulfilled their promises often they've simply made new and bigger
[1492.00 --> 1498.08]  problems nuclear fission brings heat to cold homes but also the threat of a nuclear winter
[1498.08 --> 1505.28]  the internet promises to bring us together but it makes the world a lonely people who spend more
[1505.28 --> 1510.88]  time looking at glowing rectangles than in the faces of other people in an attempt to solve the
[1510.88 --> 1514.72]  mystery of the world's brokenness we've also established political and economic systems like
[1514.72 --> 1521.44]  communism socialism and capitalism along with many other failed isms that promise freedom but leave us
[1521.44 --> 1528.32]  as slaves even modern day health fads you ready for this hope even modern day health fads are an attempt
[1528.32 --> 1534.00]  to solve the mystery of brokenness but essential oils aren't potent enough to cover the stench of sin
[1534.72 --> 1540.88]  veganism will never find enough kale to cover our shame sorry to the kale lovers a paleo diet cannot
[1540.88 --> 1547.12]  restore us to the original human condition crossfit cannot make us strong enough to carry the weight of
[1547.12 --> 1553.84]  the world's brokenness our world is marked by a brutal and comprehensive brokenness we are spiritually
[1553.84 --> 1559.60]  cut off from god socially separated from one another physically alienated from the flourishing we were
[1559.60 --> 1566.56]  intended to experience from the beginning that's the issue and what culture is doing in so many deceptive
[1566.56 --> 1571.84]  false ways saying here's where you find salvation this purchase this relationship this social media this
[1571.84 --> 1577.68]  number of followers this self-determined identity and jesus when he invites us to follow him as an
[1577.68 --> 1587.12]  apprentice he's saying that is slavery let me show you the real problem and let me liberate you in the deepest
[1587.12 --> 1597.28]  possible way the problem is sin and i want to return at the end of my sermon to where paul begins in this
[1597.28 --> 1606.64]  passage how does paul start he says therefore brothers and sisters in view of god's mercy all the
[1606.64 --> 1611.04]  commands all the urging paul makes about breaking the cultural mold about being transformed by the
[1611.04 --> 1617.12]  renewing of our minds it all hinges on what in the world he means when he says in view of god's mercy
[1618.80 --> 1626.16]  and he writes in his commentary on this passage he says christian living never begins with a set of rules
[1626.16 --> 1631.20]  though it contains them though it contains them as it goes forward it begins glad self-offering of one's
[1631.20 --> 1641.04]  whole self to god whose mercy has come all the way to meet us in our rebellion in our sin and death
[1642.72 --> 1650.56]  while we were still sinners god in his mercy through the work of jesus christ liberated us from the power of sin
[1650.56 --> 1655.60]  and death and satan
[1656.00 --> 1660.48]  two or three weeks ago britney and i sat down and we watched the lion the witch and the wardrobe i don't
[1660.48 --> 1663.68]  know if you've seen that but it's a good movie not as good as the book but still a good movie
[1664.48 --> 1668.16]  and i have a favorite scene and i've seen this movie twice now and both times it's the one that
[1668.16 --> 1673.36]  kind of gets the hair on my arms kind of lifting up and it's right after aslan he's put on the stone
[1673.36 --> 1678.24]  tablet he's killed by the queen and the stone tablet breaks and aslan is now resurrected and he's
[1678.24 --> 1681.84]  running but he doesn't run to the battle you know the story there's a battle happening and it's not
[1681.84 --> 1687.92]  looking good for humanity but aslan runs to a different place he runs to the castle where the
[1687.92 --> 1693.36]  queen is and he runs into the area where there's hundreds of frozen animals under the spell of that
[1693.36 --> 1702.24]  queen and what he does is breathe on these animals and this ice melts away and they slowly come alive and
[1702.24 --> 1710.80]  they see him and the beautiful thing in that scene is they look in the face of the person the animal who
[1710.80 --> 1720.32]  has already defeated the queen and in the same way as christ by his power breathes life into us by the spirit
[1721.12 --> 1729.04]  as we follow him we're following the one who's already defeated the power of sin he has already defeated
[1729.04 --> 1735.44]  satan by the cross he's already risen victoriously over the grave and we stand in his power by his
[1735.44 --> 1743.04]  authority by his spirit as free people who stand behind the one who's already won the victory and the
[1743.04 --> 1749.28]  goal of our life is to live in the freedom he's already provided us by way of his death and his resurrection
[1749.28 --> 1760.48]  when jesus invites us to follow him he invites us into liberation from the power of sin the idols of
[1760.48 --> 1769.04]  culture and the false stories do you know what you've been invited into and do you know what you are being
[1769.04 --> 1777.84]  pulled out of you know one of my prayers for our church is that we get to encounter the diagnetes of today
[1778.56 --> 1784.24]  that there are serious people asking really good questions about what the church is for why the
[1784.24 --> 1790.08]  church exists why they don't seem to fit the mold of canadian society i hope that our church has many
[1790.08 --> 1795.20]  opportunities where people say you just don't fit in here what's the deal with you and you have the
[1795.20 --> 1801.76]  chance to say let me tell you about the one who has liberated us from the power of sin
[1801.76 --> 1808.32]  and the freedom i found in the gospel of jesus christ let's pray
[1812.00 --> 1817.68]  father we thank you for your word we thank you that you have found us all the way
[1817.68 --> 1825.20]  thank you for defeating the power of sin for rising victorious from the grave thank you for being
[1825.20 --> 1829.04]  the one who rules the world even in this moment and giving us your holy spirit
[1829.04 --> 1837.28]  lord we pray that by your strength we would break from the cultural mold
[1838.48 --> 1845.44]  we pray that we would be faithful apprentices and we pray lord even this week we would learn how to
[1845.44 --> 1854.00]  step into the freedom you have given us fill us with your spirit walk before us in your strength we ask amen
[1854.00 --> 1861.52]  this morning as jonathan already mentioned we are going to celebrate communion together and i was
[1861.52 --> 1865.76]  told last time i led communion that i went way too fast into it and sometimes especially our young
[1865.76 --> 1870.40]  families need a few minutes so what i'm going to do is i'm going to allow the worship team to just
[1870.40 --> 1876.40]  play music and i invite you to get the elements ready in your living room to spend time praying you want
[1876.40 --> 1880.72]  to spend some time just preparing for this meal and then i will lead us through the lord's supper
[1884.64 --> 1895.04]  um
[1895.20 --> 1895.92]  too
[1895.92 --> 1905.92]  uh
[1914.00 --> 1916.00]  Amen.
[1944.00 --> 1946.00]  Amen.
[1974.00 --> 1976.00]  Amen.
[2000.00 --> 2001.86]  Every city,
[2002.54 --> 2003.36]  every community,
[2004.00 --> 2004.76]  throughout history,
[2005.76 --> 2007.02]  has always found ways
[2007.02 --> 2007.98]  to form people
[2007.98 --> 2009.54]  through feasts and celebrations.
[2010.72 --> 2011.56]  It's found ways
[2011.56 --> 2012.64]  to sort of pull away
[2012.64 --> 2014.04]  and gather together
[2014.04 --> 2015.12]  to celebrate a meal
[2015.12 --> 2015.60]  that says,
[2015.82 --> 2016.64]  this is who you are.
[2017.66 --> 2018.68]  And throughout the centuries,
[2019.00 --> 2019.50]  the church,
[2019.76 --> 2021.34]  after Jesus' ascension,
[2021.84 --> 2023.74]  has taken this meal
[2023.74 --> 2024.18]  and says,
[2024.30 --> 2025.10]  this is the meal.
[2025.70 --> 2026.74]  This is the feast.
[2026.94 --> 2027.90]  This is the celebration
[2027.90 --> 2029.76]  that says who we are.
[2030.46 --> 2032.60]  Our identity is in Jesus Christ,
[2032.60 --> 2034.80]  whose body and blood
[2034.80 --> 2036.32]  was given for us.
[2036.72 --> 2037.54]  And in him,
[2037.72 --> 2038.56]  we have life,
[2039.06 --> 2040.16]  and he is the head
[2040.16 --> 2040.78]  of the body.
[2042.30 --> 2042.96]  And so hope,
[2043.14 --> 2043.84]  it is my privilege
[2043.84 --> 2044.52]  to lead us
[2044.52 --> 2046.20]  as the body scattered
[2046.20 --> 2047.00]  throughout the city
[2047.00 --> 2047.68]  this morning
[2047.68 --> 2048.90]  in this meal
[2048.90 --> 2050.54]  that forms our identity,
[2051.14 --> 2051.86]  in this feast
[2051.86 --> 2052.66]  that tells us
[2052.66 --> 2053.42]  who we are.
[2054.22 --> 2055.16]  And as we begin,
[2055.32 --> 2056.56]  I want to read words
[2056.56 --> 2057.58]  from Galatians 2,
[2057.64 --> 2058.72]  and I'll pluralize them
[2058.72 --> 2059.34]  for the body.
[2060.06 --> 2061.70]  We have been crucified
[2061.70 --> 2062.54]  with Christ.
[2063.02 --> 2063.96]  It's no longer us
[2063.96 --> 2064.40]  who live,
[2064.48 --> 2065.54]  but Christ who lives
[2065.54 --> 2066.26]  in us.
[2066.60 --> 2068.12]  The life we now live,
[2068.64 --> 2069.68]  we live by faith
[2069.68 --> 2070.58]  in the Son of God
[2070.58 --> 2071.88]  who lives
[2071.88 --> 2073.60]  and gave himself up
[2073.60 --> 2074.66]  for us.
[2076.84 --> 2077.74]  Brothers and sisters,
[2077.84 --> 2078.22]  on the night
[2078.22 --> 2079.26]  Jesus was betrayed,
[2080.68 --> 2081.96]  he took bread.
[2081.96 --> 2085.94]  And after he'd given thanks,
[2086.00 --> 2086.48]  he broke it,
[2086.50 --> 2087.72]  and he said to his disciples,
[2087.98 --> 2088.90]  this is my body.
[2089.58 --> 2090.28]  Do this
[2090.28 --> 2091.50]  in remembrance of me.
[2093.04 --> 2093.86]  The same way,
[2093.92 --> 2094.68]  he took the cup,
[2095.62 --> 2096.82]  and after he'd poured it
[2096.82 --> 2097.46]  and gave thanks,
[2097.52 --> 2097.82]  he said,
[2097.90 --> 2098.60]  this is the cup
[2098.60 --> 2099.54]  of the new covenant.
[2100.50 --> 2101.96]  My blood poured out
[2101.96 --> 2102.40]  for many.
[2103.40 --> 2104.10]  Do this
[2104.10 --> 2105.80]  in remembrance of me.
[2107.70 --> 2109.50]  As Paul encourages
[2109.50 --> 2110.00]  the church,
[2110.14 --> 2111.20]  whenever we eat
[2111.20 --> 2111.82]  this bread,
[2112.86 --> 2113.48]  and whenever we,
[2113.64 --> 2114.46]  as followers of Jesus,
[2114.66 --> 2115.44]  drink this cup,
[2115.60 --> 2116.42]  we proclaim
[2116.42 --> 2118.38]  the death of Jesus
[2118.38 --> 2119.58]  until he comes again.
[2120.90 --> 2121.52]  And so,
[2121.72 --> 2122.54]  I invite you,
[2123.22 --> 2123.98]  to those of us
[2123.98 --> 2124.60]  who believe
[2124.60 --> 2125.64]  that Jesus is
[2125.64 --> 2126.52]  Lord, Savior,
[2126.64 --> 2127.04]  and King,
[2127.68 --> 2128.88]  I invite you to take,
[2129.72 --> 2130.00]  eat,
[2130.72 --> 2131.10]  drink,
[2131.76 --> 2132.18]  remember,
[2132.46 --> 2133.14]  and believe
[2133.14 --> 2134.18]  that the body
[2134.18 --> 2135.30]  and blood of Christ
[2135.30 --> 2135.82]  was given
[2135.82 --> 2136.92]  for the complete
[2136.92 --> 2137.74]  forgiveness
[2137.74 --> 2139.66]  of all our sins.
[2141.96 --> 2143.54]  John Nielsen and
[2143.54 --> 2145.48]  another,
[2145.68 --> 2146.80]  the Ä...
[2149.22 --> 2149.84]  aaheal
[2156.10 --> 2158.58]  and the
[2158.58 --> 2159.78]  mother
[2159.78 --> 2159.80]  gib해�
[2159.80 --> 2160.74]  into this
[2160.74 --> 2160.80]  room.
[2160.80 --> 2190.78]  Thank you.
[2190.80 --> 2220.78]  Thank you.
[2220.80 --> 2225.02]  And that second verse in the song is really that verse of dedication.
[2225.26 --> 2231.80]  All of our ambitions, all of our hopes, all of our dreams, we surrender them to your plan.
[2232.38 --> 2236.98]  So let's spend some more time in prayer, dedicating our lives, praying through how God is speaking to us.
[2237.02 --> 2238.62]  And then we'll finish by singing together.
[2238.62 --> 2240.62]  Thank you.
[2240.62 --> 2241.62]  Thank you.
[2241.62 --> 2242.62]  Thank you.
[2242.62 --> 2243.62]  Thank you.
