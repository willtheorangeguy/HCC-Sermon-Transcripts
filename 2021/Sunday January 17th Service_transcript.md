[0.00 --> 2.92]  Good morning.
[5.48 --> 10.14]  It's good to be with you this morning and to gather again.
[10.94 --> 12.88]  What a wonderful blessing it is.
[14.76 --> 19.54]  We are in part three of a series called Apprenticing with Jesus.
[20.74 --> 25.18]  And last week I talked about the idea of being with Jesus,
[25.18 --> 27.96]  about practicing the presence of God,
[27.96 --> 30.32]  about abiding in Jesus,
[31.02 --> 33.62]  and how getting the life with Jesus
[33.62 --> 36.86]  involves living the lifestyle of Jesus.
[37.86 --> 39.18]  At the end of the service,
[39.26 --> 43.26]  I challenge you to start with ten minutes of silence and solitude,
[44.10 --> 46.96]  where you would reflect on a phrase or a verse,
[47.38 --> 51.62]  or simply practice silence in the midst of God's presence.
[51.62 --> 55.16]  So I'm going to start this service with, well, how'd that go?
[56.40 --> 57.42]  Some of you are probably saying,
[57.42 --> 58.72]  oh, I got started.
[58.92 --> 60.12]  And I'd say, great, keep going.
[60.24 --> 62.54]  And some of you are saying, well, that hasn't happened yet,
[62.58 --> 65.68]  and I want to encourage you to go at it.
[66.54 --> 71.54]  I love how Brittany Gruen echoed this challenge on Facebook and Twitter.
[72.18 --> 73.52]  I hear Twitter is quite cool.
[73.60 --> 74.02]  I'm not on it.
[74.02 --> 77.24]  And I encourage you to check that out.
[77.24 --> 83.96]  She beautifully nudged herself and then others to take this step into practicing the presence of Jesus
[83.96 --> 85.42]  with a little bit of intentionality.
[86.66 --> 89.92]  Val, our small group coordinator, also put together a newsletter,
[90.32 --> 93.96]  and it also helped to push us a little bit along that path.
[94.02 --> 96.72]  So there's some things to look at as well.
[96.72 --> 102.12]  This is what it is to be a follower and an apprentice of Jesus.
[102.68 --> 103.76]  We take some steps.
[104.66 --> 106.10]  So let's get into today's message.
[106.54 --> 111.00]  Luke 6, we're going to read a parable and look at it with me.
[111.06 --> 113.12]  Luke 6, verses 39 through 40.
[113.12 --> 143.10]  Luke 6, verses 39 through 40.
[143.12 --> 146.78] narly blind leaders, blind disciples following blind leaders.
[147.16 --> 148.04]  You get the point.
[148.12 --> 148.94]  They're going to fall in a pit.
[149.04 --> 150.62]  There are sure problems to happen.
[151.96 --> 155.82]  And then he goes on to, Jesus says, the student, the disciple, the apprentice,
[156.22 --> 162.06]  who is trained will be like the teacher, like their rabbi,
[162.26 --> 165.40]  which is the point of apprenticeship and discipleship.
[166.42 --> 172.50]  This is not just knowing your Bible, but being like Jesus, living out God's will.
[172.50 --> 176.82]  And notice the passage said, fully trained.
[177.60 --> 182.20]  You don't become an apprentice and a follower of Jesus by accident.
[182.90 --> 186.54]  There involves some intentionality, and it takes time.
[187.44 --> 194.08]  So if we are wanting to be with Jesus so that we can be like Jesus,
[194.42 --> 198.38]  that means training, and that means change.
[200.20 --> 202.20]  I can hear some people saying, be like Jesus.
[202.20 --> 203.24]  Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[203.82 --> 204.34]  Change.
[205.62 --> 206.60]  Not so much.
[207.78 --> 208.86]  I saw this cartoon.
[209.14 --> 210.76]  Actually, Estelle sent it to me.
[211.20 --> 215.52]  I'd seen it before, but it kind of fit well, where you see on this cartoon,
[215.98 --> 218.10]  there's the speaker.
[219.10 --> 221.14]  He's saying, who wants change?
[221.18 --> 222.68]  And you see all the hands go up.
[223.10 --> 224.60]  And who wants to change?
[224.74 --> 227.90]  And you see a very subdued crowd there.
[229.24 --> 231.32]  We don't always love the idea.
[231.32 --> 235.46]  We love the idea of change, but not necessarily the idea of putting the effort in to do so.
[235.92 --> 239.04]  And this isn't change when we talk about apprenticing with Jesus.
[239.16 --> 243.82]  This isn't change that's a bit about tweaking life a little bit here and there.
[244.04 --> 245.52]  It's not about self-help.
[245.78 --> 249.24]  It's becoming like a slightly improved you.
[249.36 --> 250.86]  No, no, not that at all.
[251.10 --> 253.42]  It's becoming like Jesus.
[253.42 --> 256.96]  That ought to sink in a little bit.
[257.30 --> 259.42]  Becoming like Jesus.
[259.42 --> 265.14]  And this involves an entire overhaul of ourselves from the inside out.
[265.78 --> 268.60]  Scripture describes it as the death of self.
[269.72 --> 271.16]  That's not a tweak.
[273.26 --> 277.94]  The Apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians writes, in 2 Corinthians 3, he writes,
[277.94 --> 286.48]  And we all, who with unveiled faces, and it's a reference to Moses there, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, and here we go,
[286.66 --> 295.02]  are being transformed into His image completely, not only right away, no, no, with ever-increasing glory,
[295.02 --> 300.96]  which comes from the Lord, well, not from you, who is the Spirit.
[302.36 --> 305.68]  It's becoming like Jesus more and more and more.
[305.94 --> 307.44]  It's transformation.
[308.42 --> 311.74]  In other words, metamorphosis, or metamorphosis.
[312.08 --> 312.22]  Right?
[312.48 --> 315.70]  That's what we use, that profound change from a caterpillar into a butterfly.
[316.08 --> 317.42]  That's kind of a good picture of it.
[317.74 --> 319.02]  Here's the question.
[319.92 --> 322.74]  Is this kind of change possible?
[323.54 --> 324.70]  And if so, how?
[325.02 --> 329.54]  I don't want you to be too quick to say, well, yes.
[330.14 --> 331.62]  I mean, really think on this.
[332.20 --> 334.86]  You know, I think sometimes we need to really look at our lives, right?
[335.08 --> 340.02]  I hit a wall quite a number of years back in the thick of ministry.
[340.42 --> 344.74]  On the surface, I was doing fine, not so much below the surface.
[345.60 --> 354.32]  And God was inviting me to shine His light into some dark corners of my life where I had not allowed the discipleship of Jesus to enter.
[355.02 --> 360.98]  And part of me, I have to be very honest, part of me did not want that light shone in those corners.
[360.98 --> 366.86]  I had some huge struggles with anxiety, some big health issues happening in my life.
[366.90 --> 369.20]  I was physically, spiritually, and mentally unhealthy.
[369.66 --> 371.58]  I needed deeper transformation.
[372.26 --> 374.38]  And it started with a burnout.
[374.38 --> 384.02]  I was forced to surrender and to live into what it meant for all of me to be transformed into the likeness of the one I claimed to follow.
[384.02 --> 393.32]  This involved counseling, involved rest, reading, praying, crying.
[394.88 --> 399.80]  It involved an amazing wife with capacity to come alongside.
[399.80 --> 412.46]  But the real start was the same as anyone in AA knows, admitting I'm powerless to changes and I need a higher power.
[412.46 --> 424.80]  I began at that time to unpack what it meant for Sid to be with Jesus who simply loved Him and invited Him to become like Himself in every way.
[426.02 --> 434.66]  Through surrender, through practices, through Sabbath rest, learning to trust the Spirit's work in the entirety of who I was.
[434.66 --> 441.46]  That began a life-changing experience and process that is ever ongoing.
[441.96 --> 444.20]  And I've unlearned a lot.
[444.60 --> 447.52]  I think that's sometimes the starting point for a lot of us.
[447.62 --> 449.84]  I unlearned a lot and then learned a lot.
[451.38 --> 455.62]  Transformation, the process of change, the work of Jonathan said of sanctification.
[456.60 --> 460.00]  We want change, but how?
[460.00 --> 465.38]  Now, I'm going to go back to Dallas Willard, who I quoted a few times last week as well.
[466.26 --> 467.16]  And he said this,
[468.28 --> 478.84]  Spiritual formation in the Christian tradition is a process of increasingly being possessed and permeated by the character traits of Jesus
[478.84 --> 483.56]  as we walk in the easy yoke of discipleship with Jesus, our teacher.
[483.56 --> 490.80]  Don't let that phrase, easy yoke, make it sound like it's not difficult sometimes, but it is an easy yoke.
[493.16 --> 498.08]  In this series, I've been doing a lot of reading from John Mark Cormer, and he says so many good things.
[498.30 --> 504.80]  But some of what he said was the spiritual formation isn't just a Christian thing, it's a human thing.
[505.90 --> 512.20]  Somehow we're all being formed all the time, spiritually, mentally, all kinds of ways.
[512.20 --> 515.94]  The question isn't really, are you an apprentice?
[516.64 --> 519.96]  It's rather, who or what are you an apprentice of?
[520.54 --> 522.88]  We are all disciples of something.
[524.02 --> 527.86]  Like the great theologian Bob Dylan said, right, you've got to serve somebody.
[528.12 --> 529.76]  You're following somebody.
[530.94 --> 532.82]  All of us are being formed.
[533.08 --> 535.04]  The question is formed into what?
[535.04 --> 544.58]  We have, I think, a lot of people who are living with unintended spiritual formation.
[546.16 --> 548.14]  Unintended formation in general as well.
[548.44 --> 552.90]  Many go about their lives not particularly aware of how they are being shaped.
[553.04 --> 559.40]  At work, at school, as they watch TV, as they participate in sports, as they hang out with people.
[559.40 --> 566.96]  And I've often felt like a lot of people, they end up floating through life.
[567.86 --> 572.32]  Just being bumped along by currents and whatever else is happening.
[573.32 --> 576.42]  Let me assure you, we all live by a narrative of some sort.
[576.62 --> 578.58]  By some kind of defining story.
[579.44 --> 581.22]  Some kind of guiding story.
[581.22 --> 586.86]  And these stories rise to up and shape the way you live.
[588.22 --> 589.40]  Let me illustrate that.
[590.18 --> 593.12]  If you think life is all just about chance.
[593.74 --> 596.20]  And that man is just another complex animal.
[596.80 --> 599.68]  Then that particular story affects the way you live.
[600.44 --> 601.48]  Let me follow that further.
[601.86 --> 603.22]  Let's take sex for example.
[604.12 --> 607.20]  If sex is just biological drives at work.
[607.84 --> 609.66]  Okay, that's the context of the story.
[609.66 --> 611.22]  That's like the animals.
[611.60 --> 613.84]  Then marriage is just a human construct.
[614.96 --> 620.64]  Well, if that's your story, it will affect how you approach marriage and sex.
[620.78 --> 622.24]  And even how you define love.
[622.92 --> 626.00]  It has huge implications on the way you live.
[626.48 --> 629.48]  And that in turn, it develops into habits.
[629.92 --> 631.50]  About how we live out the story.
[632.24 --> 635.46]  There's a lot of research out there right now on the effect of habits.
[635.50 --> 636.34]  And the power of habits.
[636.34 --> 641.96]  We are so much a product of our daily and our weekly habits and rituals.
[643.12 --> 647.22]  I think that's why it's so essential to gather in a weekly rhythm.
[647.32 --> 649.64]  I think it shapes us in ways we don't even realize.
[650.30 --> 653.04]  What we do on a regular basis, we become.
[654.62 --> 656.10]  And your habits shape you.
[656.16 --> 657.78]  And they shape you for good or bad.
[658.34 --> 661.52]  Scripture talks about your heart being shaped by what you do.
[661.52 --> 664.96]  I'm trying to think of concrete examples for these things.
[665.52 --> 667.18]  Take coffee, for example, right?
[667.60 --> 669.12]  When the first time you ever had coffee.
[669.26 --> 670.32]  Just think back on that.
[670.74 --> 672.54]  Many, I remember this for myself too.
[672.78 --> 675.24]  Many don't like the taste of coffee at first.
[676.00 --> 678.24]  But it's such a social thing to do.
[678.52 --> 679.44]  And so you drink it.
[679.54 --> 680.84]  You know, lots of sugar, lots of cream.
[680.92 --> 681.82]  You try to make it palatable.
[682.22 --> 686.64]  Until such time, you've got to have a coffee first thing in the morning.
[687.18 --> 688.04]  Or you die.
[688.04 --> 688.68]  Right?
[690.00 --> 691.04]  That's kind of how we feel.
[692.16 --> 695.08]  Ironically, you get older and suddenly that caffeine misses with you.
[695.12 --> 697.30]  And you have to wean yourself off that drug somehow.
[697.84 --> 699.60]  But that's another question here.
[699.96 --> 701.16]  Our habits, the point is this.
[701.36 --> 702.48]  Our habits shape us.
[702.78 --> 704.18]  Our habits shape our love.
[704.30 --> 705.28]  They shape our longings.
[705.34 --> 706.38]  They shape our desires.
[707.30 --> 708.76]  They shape how we live.
[711.88 --> 715.72]  And then we are also shaped by those we relate to.
[715.72 --> 716.72]  Right?
[717.34 --> 719.68]  I mean, we've all had the expression birds of a feather kind of thing.
[720.18 --> 723.94]  We, to some degree, become like those we hang out with.
[727.58 --> 732.42]  You know, we see it showing up in politics.
[733.52 --> 733.66]  Right?
[733.70 --> 737.76]  We look at, oh, conservatives have to hang out with conservatives, liberals with liberals.
[738.60 --> 739.24]  We have camps.
[739.24 --> 743.00]  I mean, it turns, and we see the example of it, turns into something not particularly nice.
[743.08 --> 743.28]  Is it?
[744.10 --> 747.48]  A simpler example in some ways, you look at fashions, right?
[747.84 --> 754.84]  It's interesting that each generation tries to express their independence by dressing exactly like everybody else.
[754.84 --> 756.56]  And we've all done that.
[756.72 --> 756.84]  Right?
[756.90 --> 759.42]  We are shaped by the group we hang out with.
[759.68 --> 762.94]  And this can be good or this can be bad depending on the group or a mix of both.
[764.02 --> 769.58]  We're shaped by even the area we live in, Vancouver versus Edmonton versus Toronto.
[770.06 --> 771.74]  I mean, nobody wants to come from Toronto.
[772.00 --> 773.06]  Well, we want to come from Toronto.
[773.18 --> 774.18]  But anyway, that's another matter here.
[774.24 --> 775.56]  A little personal stuff going on there.
[775.56 --> 777.12]  The point is this.
[777.78 --> 780.40]  Environments shape us too.
[782.04 --> 783.36]  More than we might realize.
[784.76 --> 787.34]  And then we have our internet worlds and our phone worlds.
[787.58 --> 788.54]  And they're shaping us.
[788.84 --> 791.98]  The blogs we read, the music we listen to, wherever we go.
[792.50 --> 795.38]  All of it forms us.
[796.52 --> 799.50]  And you can just float along and let it happen,
[799.86 --> 801.52]  living unaware of how you're being shaped.
[801.94 --> 803.86]  And that's an option, not a particularly good one.
[803.86 --> 807.08]  Or you can learn to live with greater awareness.
[807.74 --> 812.26]  And learn to counter the negatives of life by apprenticing with Jesus
[812.26 --> 815.50]  so that you are aware of your shaping
[815.50 --> 817.88]  and that you don't become like your environment,
[818.26 --> 821.72]  but rather you become more and more like Him.
[823.94 --> 828.66]  Now, I'd like to address just a couple of misconceptions
[828.66 --> 834.42]  that I think in the Christian world tend to help us approach this matter
[834.42 --> 837.48]  of becoming like Jesus but messes with it a little bit.
[838.12 --> 840.96]  Hear me well, because at first this isn't going to sound right.
[841.48 --> 845.48]  But there's two misconceptions in the Christian world that we hold on to.
[845.86 --> 846.60]  And one is this.
[846.60 --> 849.02]  The first one is this.
[849.06 --> 850.68]  All we need to do is know the Bible.
[852.28 --> 854.54]  All we need to do is read the Bible, study the Bible, memorize it.
[855.62 --> 856.52]  Let me say clearly.
[856.78 --> 858.86]  This is obviously important.
[859.88 --> 861.56]  I want you to study your Bible.
[861.56 --> 867.78]  But I want to throw a word of caution with this.
[868.88 --> 871.18]  I'm going to jump back, way back to the Enlightenment.
[871.38 --> 872.84]  The Enlightenment, that time in history
[872.84 --> 875.88]  where we suddenly became enlightened as if we never were.
[877.74 --> 880.92]  But this idea, the phrase that came out of the Enlightenment was,
[881.30 --> 885.64]  I think, therefore I, and you can fill in blank, I am.
[885.64 --> 889.28]  The idea was that you trust your thinking.
[889.62 --> 891.48]  Now remember, we're shaped by history as well.
[891.84 --> 892.72]  You can trust your thinking.
[892.94 --> 895.52]  So you want to change, you read something.
[895.94 --> 896.88]  You get some thoughts.
[897.10 --> 898.16]  You think about something.
[898.26 --> 898.50]  Done.
[898.74 --> 899.46]  Change happens.
[900.50 --> 901.66]  Got a problem with anxiety?
[902.26 --> 902.88]  Read about it.
[903.04 --> 903.30]  Done.
[903.44 --> 903.90]  Think differently.
[904.04 --> 904.62]  Problem solved.
[905.96 --> 906.76]  Read the Bible?
[907.00 --> 907.24]  Done.
[907.48 --> 908.18]  Problem solved.
[911.66 --> 912.48]  Here's the thing.
[912.48 --> 917.20]  There's a lot of stuff I know but don't do.
[918.68 --> 923.76]  The Apostle Paul said it rather well in Romans 7 where we read,
[924.26 --> 925.96]  I do not understand what I do.
[927.14 --> 929.96]  For what I want to do, I do not do.
[930.68 --> 933.30]  What I hate, I do.
[936.00 --> 939.66]  We cannot merely think ourselves into Christ's likeness.
[939.66 --> 943.72]  It is the way of Jesus.
[944.12 --> 946.26]  I am the way, the truth, and the light.
[947.50 --> 948.48]  It's the way of Jesus.
[948.64 --> 950.58]  Not just a bunch of thoughts about him.
[951.38 --> 954.92]  Too many churches make discipleship just an intellectual endeavor.
[956.56 --> 961.56]  And I have to admit, my reformed tradition falls into that camp.
[961.64 --> 963.94]  I grew up in many ways in that kind of a system.
[963.94 --> 966.96]  Faith is just an information transfer.
[967.86 --> 971.96]  But information transfer alone does not yield transformation.
[972.40 --> 974.42]  It's not the whole of it by a long shot.
[974.64 --> 975.86]  It's overly simplistic.
[976.30 --> 979.14]  And often false to think that as your knowledge of the Bible increases,
[979.26 --> 980.68]  so will your Christ's likeness.
[982.30 --> 982.76]  It might.
[983.50 --> 984.66]  But not necessarily.
[984.82 --> 985.96]  There's a whole lot more going on.
[986.18 --> 990.56]  Again, this is in no way diminishing the study of Scripture,
[990.56 --> 992.38]  which I think is hugely important.
[994.34 --> 995.48]  But there's other steps,
[995.78 --> 998.30]  and that's why we talked about practices that need to take place.
[998.34 --> 1000.12]  And one of the practices is study of Scripture.
[1000.58 --> 1002.40]  But there's more than that going on as well.
[1002.76 --> 1005.08]  Here's a second misconception that happens in the Christian world.
[1005.98 --> 1007.66]  You don't need to do anything.
[1007.86 --> 1008.98]  It's all God.
[1009.92 --> 1010.98]  And we have phrases like,
[1011.30 --> 1012.56]  let go and let...
[1013.36 --> 1014.28]  Right, you can fill in the blank.
[1014.36 --> 1014.60]  God.
[1014.60 --> 1020.00]  Again, surrendering to God is essential.
[1020.38 --> 1022.34]  It's been one of the most important things
[1022.34 --> 1026.12]  that I've learned to do in the past decade more and more and more
[1026.12 --> 1027.80]  is this constant act of surrender.
[1027.94 --> 1029.66]  So I'm not, again, not knocking to...
[1029.66 --> 1031.82]  Please, but please hear me well here.
[1032.12 --> 1035.22]  Don't let surrender be an excuse for you to be inactive.
[1036.74 --> 1037.46]  You know, like, I surrender.
[1037.86 --> 1039.26]  And then you just lay there like a lump.
[1039.44 --> 1040.74]  That's not what we're talking about here.
[1041.44 --> 1041.98]  Let me illustrate.
[1041.98 --> 1042.10]  Great.
[1043.80 --> 1047.86]  You're dealing with a kid that's challenging a seven-year-old.
[1048.00 --> 1050.16]  And you're losing your mind with this kid.
[1050.80 --> 1052.46]  And you go up, you look up to the heaven, you say,
[1052.52 --> 1054.66]  Jesus, I'm dealing with my annoying seven-year-old.
[1055.04 --> 1056.82]  Send me patience now.
[1058.84 --> 1061.74]  I think all parents at times have probably uttered prayers like that.
[1062.42 --> 1063.92]  So I'm not saying don't pray.
[1064.02 --> 1064.66]  Of course you do.
[1065.14 --> 1066.46]  But you might need to say,
[1066.74 --> 1067.96]  gee, is this an ongoing thing?
[1068.14 --> 1069.78]  And what actions do I need to take?
[1069.78 --> 1073.44]  Do I need to talk to other parents and see what they're doing to deal with this kind of situation?
[1073.98 --> 1075.32]  Do I need, is this really bad?
[1075.38 --> 1077.60]  Do I need to get some counseling, some help?
[1077.86 --> 1080.00]  Do I need to read some kind of book on parenting?
[1080.30 --> 1082.62]  There's steps that you might need to take,
[1082.84 --> 1084.58]  not just shouting a prayer to heaven,
[1084.86 --> 1086.26]  albeit that's important too.
[1088.58 --> 1089.70]  Go a little deeper than that.
[1089.70 --> 1095.26]  Jesus, Jesus, please, please stop this addiction now.
[1099.66 --> 1102.00]  That's been a prayer that's been uttered many times, I'm sure.
[1104.16 --> 1107.14]  But then there's, you don't step into a 12-step program,
[1107.54 --> 1109.88]  and you have no accountability and no counseling.
[1111.96 --> 1113.34]  You're just shouting out prayers.
[1113.34 --> 1116.76]  I love this saying.
[1116.94 --> 1118.80]  A lot of sayings are kind of trite.
[1118.88 --> 1120.08]  This one I kind of like.
[1120.88 --> 1121.50]  It says this,
[1121.68 --> 1122.46]  Without Him, God,
[1122.84 --> 1124.52]  without Him we can't,
[1125.38 --> 1127.30]  without us, He won't.
[1129.14 --> 1131.14]  And I just was doing some thinking on that.
[1131.38 --> 1131.74]  And again,
[1132.20 --> 1133.86]  I know every saying has its limits,
[1133.94 --> 1134.76]  so don't overthink it.
[1134.86 --> 1136.30]  But without Him we can't,
[1136.44 --> 1137.72]  without us, He won't.
[1138.02 --> 1140.50]  Somehow, God wants us in
[1140.50 --> 1141.58]  on our transformation.
[1141.58 --> 1143.68]  God acts,
[1143.86 --> 1144.56]  and so do we.
[1146.40 --> 1146.74]  Again,
[1147.76 --> 1148.54]  Dallas Willard.
[1148.76 --> 1149.00]  You're going to say,
[1149.06 --> 1150.60]  wow, this guy loves Dallas Willard.
[1150.68 --> 1150.98]  Yeah, I do.
[1151.88 --> 1152.14]  Anyway,
[1152.34 --> 1153.46]  but he said it rather well.
[1153.70 --> 1154.00]  He said,
[1154.44 --> 1156.68]  Grace isn't opposed to effort,
[1156.88 --> 1158.02]  it's opposed to earning.
[1159.98 --> 1160.78]  Think about that.
[1161.20 --> 1162.58]  Grace isn't opposed to effort,
[1162.68 --> 1163.84]  it's opposed to earning.
[1165.00 --> 1165.16]  You know,
[1165.36 --> 1165.78]  again,
[1165.84 --> 1166.20]  I'm thinking of,
[1166.58 --> 1167.44]  we had four kids,
[1167.50 --> 1168.12]  my wife and I,
[1168.20 --> 1170.06]  and they all had some music lessons,
[1170.06 --> 1172.20]  and we made them practice.
[1173.58 --> 1175.08]  We didn't make them practice
[1175.08 --> 1175.92]  to earn our love,
[1176.08 --> 1176.74]  that was a given.
[1177.80 --> 1179.06]  It was so they'd learn to play
[1179.06 --> 1179.60]  the instruments
[1179.60 --> 1180.82]  and learn the discipline of that.
[1181.64 --> 1181.80]  You know,
[1181.82 --> 1182.90]  when we partner with God,
[1183.06 --> 1184.40]  it's kind of like that.
[1184.40 --> 1186.30]  He wants us in
[1186.30 --> 1187.50]  on our transformation.
[1188.46 --> 1189.94]  This is not about
[1189.94 --> 1192.42]  unintentional spiritual growth.
[1192.42 --> 1193.42]  This is about
[1193.42 --> 1195.40]  intentional spiritual growth.
[1196.16 --> 1197.46]  This is not about
[1197.46 --> 1199.06]  floating along,
[1199.18 --> 1200.42]  being shaped without awareness
[1200.42 --> 1201.26]  and without effort.
[1202.28 --> 1203.80]  This is you getting up
[1203.80 --> 1204.48]  each morning
[1204.48 --> 1205.42]  and intentionally thinking,
[1206.28 --> 1207.30]  I'm following Jesus,
[1207.42 --> 1208.18]  he's my rabbi,
[1208.22 --> 1209.26]  what does that mean for today?
[1209.64 --> 1212.58]  And it's counter formation as well.
[1212.64 --> 1213.46]  It's offsetting
[1213.46 --> 1214.50]  all the misinformation
[1214.50 --> 1215.66]  and the misshaping
[1215.66 --> 1216.48]  that you're getting
[1216.48 --> 1217.60]  in your life around you.
[1217.60 --> 1222.04]  So, yes,
[1223.10 --> 1223.40]  yes,
[1223.56 --> 1225.74]  read and study the Bible,
[1225.86 --> 1226.24]  of course,
[1226.60 --> 1227.98]  and read other books,
[1228.14 --> 1228.46]  great,
[1228.76 --> 1230.08]  but they should take,
[1230.28 --> 1231.16]  they should transform
[1231.16 --> 1233.42]  into some kind of action steps.
[1233.76 --> 1234.84]  You surrender,
[1235.28 --> 1235.92]  yes, of course,
[1236.02 --> 1236.56]  your will,
[1236.84 --> 1237.56]  knowing and striving
[1237.56 --> 1238.44]  to live out God's will,
[1238.66 --> 1239.80]  trying to live out that
[1239.80 --> 1241.24]  with God's power.
[1242.94 --> 1244.30]  You learn to live
[1244.30 --> 1245.34]  into the true story
[1245.34 --> 1245.74]  of the world,
[1245.84 --> 1246.52]  the story of a God
[1246.52 --> 1247.54]  who created all things,
[1247.78 --> 1248.64]  a God who loves
[1248.64 --> 1250.12]  and a God who dies for you,
[1250.34 --> 1251.60]  a God who empowers you,
[1251.90 --> 1252.88]  so you join him
[1252.88 --> 1254.06]  in the renewal of all things,
[1254.26 --> 1255.36]  including the renewal
[1255.36 --> 1256.22]  of yourself.
[1259.74 --> 1260.90]  Paul said it rather well
[1260.90 --> 1261.72]  in Romans 12.
[1263.24 --> 1264.28]  I love how he starts.
[1264.60 --> 1266.08]  Therefore, I urge you,
[1267.34 --> 1268.94]  I feel that pastoral intensity,
[1269.36 --> 1270.58]  I urge you,
[1270.70 --> 1271.68]  I beg of you,
[1271.76 --> 1272.60]  I urge you,
[1272.90 --> 1273.84]  brothers and sisters,
[1273.84 --> 1275.58]  in view of God's mercy,
[1275.74 --> 1276.56]  notice where we're starting,
[1276.70 --> 1277.28]  with God's mercy,
[1277.60 --> 1278.34]  to offer your bodies,
[1278.40 --> 1279.32]  and we could add your minds
[1279.32 --> 1280.18]  and everything else about you,
[1280.36 --> 1281.42]  as a living sacrifice,
[1281.56 --> 1282.88]  holy and pleasing to the Lord.
[1283.44 --> 1284.76]  This is your true
[1284.76 --> 1286.42]  and proper worship.
[1288.58 --> 1289.98]  Do not conform
[1289.98 --> 1291.04]  to the pattern of this world,
[1291.40 --> 1292.62]  which means you understand
[1292.62 --> 1293.78]  there's a pattern in the world,
[1294.60 --> 1295.12]  but be transformed,
[1295.12 --> 1295.70]  how?
[1295.70 --> 1297.52]  by the renewing of your mind,
[1297.52 --> 1299.12]  then you will be able to test
[1299.12 --> 1300.86]  and approve what God's will is,
[1301.06 --> 1303.02]  His good, pleasing, perfect will.
[1305.82 --> 1306.70]  So yes,
[1307.48 --> 1308.62]  work on your mind,
[1309.26 --> 1311.26]  studying, reading, praying,
[1311.46 --> 1312.60]  discussing, contemplating,
[1312.94 --> 1313.56]  but please,
[1313.92 --> 1314.88]  in that context,
[1315.24 --> 1316.30]  develop practices,
[1316.70 --> 1317.38]  habit-making,
[1317.56 --> 1318.98]  lifestyle-making practices.
[1318.98 --> 1322.76]  You know,
[1322.82 --> 1323.56]  I was reading the other day
[1323.56 --> 1325.18]  in my devotions,
[1325.28 --> 1325.44]  you know,
[1325.52 --> 1327.00]  that phrase of Jesus,
[1327.30 --> 1328.18]  love your enemies.
[1329.64 --> 1330.46]  And I picture us,
[1330.54 --> 1331.30]  love your enemies,
[1331.40 --> 1331.76]  got it,
[1332.02 --> 1332.30]  check.
[1333.20 --> 1333.92]  I read it,
[1334.06 --> 1334.46]  I know it,
[1334.58 --> 1334.78]  done.
[1335.56 --> 1336.50]  No, you don't.
[1338.26 --> 1339.16]  No, you don't.
[1339.52 --> 1340.28]  Yeah, you read it,
[1340.96 --> 1341.68]  but that really,
[1341.90 --> 1343.56]  that might mean nothing.
[1343.56 --> 1347.74]  Not until you're confronted
[1347.74 --> 1349.66]  with someone who's an enemy
[1349.66 --> 1351.24]  will you understand
[1351.24 --> 1352.20]  what this might mean
[1352.20 --> 1353.48]  and how you need to live that out.
[1353.94 --> 1354.92]  And I think of in the context
[1354.92 --> 1355.80]  of the world we live in
[1355.80 --> 1357.32]  with so much divisiveness.
[1357.72 --> 1359.08]  This group hates this group
[1359.08 --> 1360.74]  because they demonize this group
[1360.74 --> 1361.62]  and we have this thing.
[1361.82 --> 1363.22]  We make enemies.
[1366.72 --> 1367.88]  Even in the Christian world,
[1369.54 --> 1371.18]  I'm going to make you into an enemy
[1371.18 --> 1372.50]  because you don't think like I do.
[1374.22 --> 1375.42]  You haven't read that verse.
[1376.84 --> 1378.10]  It hasn't penetrated
[1378.10 --> 1379.08]  into the way you live.
[1379.44 --> 1381.04]  Love your enemies.
[1381.94 --> 1382.78]  That kind of love,
[1382.84 --> 1383.52]  how does that show up?
[1383.74 --> 1384.52]  It shows up for you
[1384.52 --> 1385.28]  hanging on a cross.
[1385.38 --> 1385.96]  Well, Jesus, of course,
[1386.00 --> 1386.58]  hanging on a cross,
[1386.88 --> 1388.26]  saying, Lord, forgive them.
[1388.32 --> 1389.36]  They don't know what they do.
[1389.66 --> 1390.72]  That's the kind of love
[1390.72 --> 1391.46]  we're talking about.
[1392.60 --> 1393.92]  That's loving your enemies.
[1395.52 --> 1396.12]  So no,
[1396.76 --> 1397.64]  just reading it,
[1398.50 --> 1400.08]  not even close to being enough.
[1403.56 --> 1405.26]  It's so much fun
[1405.26 --> 1406.60]  to entertain ideas
[1406.60 --> 1409.52]  on any issue.
[1409.56 --> 1410.14]  You can go ahead
[1410.14 --> 1410.82]  and name an issue.
[1411.48 --> 1412.34]  And it's so much fun
[1412.34 --> 1413.94]  just to entertain ideas
[1413.94 --> 1414.78]  and discuss
[1414.78 --> 1416.16]  and argue
[1416.16 --> 1417.12]  and debate
[1417.12 --> 1418.42]  and all that's fine.
[1419.58 --> 1420.68]  But you can name the issue
[1420.68 --> 1421.88]  and if you don't know somebody
[1421.88 --> 1422.88]  who actually lives
[1422.88 --> 1424.14]  in the context of that issue
[1424.14 --> 1425.10]  and you haven't talked to them,
[1425.36 --> 1426.58]  you really kind of don't understand.
[1426.58 --> 1431.92]  and it needs to be lived out.
[1434.02 --> 1434.62]  And yes,
[1434.70 --> 1435.80]  that does come with knowledge.
[1436.80 --> 1437.20]  Absolutely.
[1438.30 --> 1439.72]  But it also comes with practices
[1439.72 --> 1441.04]  that shape and reshape you.
[1442.18 --> 1443.12]  Trust in God's spirit
[1443.12 --> 1444.20]  the whole time.
[1445.46 --> 1446.46]  Apart from me,
[1446.46 --> 1448.46]  you can do nothing.
[1450.54 --> 1451.38]  So yes,
[1451.96 --> 1453.12]  trying real hard
[1453.12 --> 1454.04]  is important.
[1454.04 --> 1457.06]  More important though
[1457.06 --> 1458.62]  is training really hard.
[1459.66 --> 1460.56]  Because trying,
[1461.06 --> 1461.72]  as we all know,
[1461.78 --> 1462.88]  only takes us so far.
[1464.30 --> 1464.58]  Again,
[1465.58 --> 1466.28]  back to
[1466.28 --> 1467.78]  an example of parenting.
[1468.10 --> 1469.44]  Imagine telling your young child
[1469.44 --> 1470.72]  who just started music lessons,
[1471.04 --> 1471.66]  you come up to them
[1471.66 --> 1471.86]  and say,
[1471.98 --> 1472.10]  okay,
[1472.18 --> 1473.18]  here's a piece from Mozart.
[1474.42 --> 1475.14]  Have at her.
[1476.44 --> 1477.12]  Play it for me.
[1477.40 --> 1478.18]  And I'm just going to pray
[1478.18 --> 1479.44]  real hard that you can.
[1482.34 --> 1482.86]  Of course,
[1482.92 --> 1483.64]  that's a disaster.
[1485.04 --> 1485.34]  No,
[1485.38 --> 1485.46]  no,
[1485.46 --> 1485.58]  no,
[1485.62 --> 1486.84]  you encourage practice
[1486.84 --> 1487.68]  and practice
[1487.68 --> 1488.44]  and practice
[1488.44 --> 1489.12]  and practice
[1489.12 --> 1490.20]  until one day
[1490.20 --> 1491.18]  they can play that piece
[1491.18 --> 1491.70]  by Mozart.
[1494.30 --> 1495.26]  For us too,
[1496.06 --> 1498.02]  it's not that you can't
[1498.02 --> 1498.98]  live a life free
[1498.98 --> 1499.54]  from worry
[1499.54 --> 1500.08]  or addiction
[1500.08 --> 1501.92]  or whatever you struggle with.
[1502.44 --> 1503.88]  It's that you can't live
[1503.88 --> 1504.52]  that way
[1504.52 --> 1505.48]  yet.
[1506.86 --> 1507.30]  Yet.
[1507.30 --> 1508.30]  you can't live a life free
[1508.30 --> 1508.60]  or anything.
[1508.60 --> 1513.18]  You know,
[1513.44 --> 1514.86]  when I think of people
[1514.86 --> 1515.24]  who have
[1515.24 --> 1517.42]  gone through 12-step programs
[1517.42 --> 1517.86]  and, you know,
[1517.88 --> 1519.06]  there's this whole process,
[1519.22 --> 1519.76]  but, you know,
[1519.82 --> 1521.08]  there's so much levels
[1521.08 --> 1522.64]  of taking steps,
[1522.72 --> 1523.46]  of accountability,
[1524.14 --> 1525.62]  of fearless moral inventories,
[1526.66 --> 1526.84]  you know,
[1527.64 --> 1528.90]  staying in touch
[1528.90 --> 1529.66]  with a sponsor,
[1530.00 --> 1531.02]  meeting with a group.
[1531.18 --> 1532.26]  So many steps.
[1532.34 --> 1532.90]  They don't just
[1532.90 --> 1533.76]  read the big book.
[1534.02 --> 1535.86]  There's so many steps.
[1536.96 --> 1537.60]  That's why it's called
[1537.60 --> 1538.40]  12 steps.
[1539.40 --> 1540.48]  It wasn't step one,
[1540.64 --> 1541.06]  read a book,
[1541.18 --> 1541.42]  done.
[1541.66 --> 1542.88]  That's not what's going on here
[1542.88 --> 1543.98]  because it's about
[1543.98 --> 1545.56]  promoting a lifestyle
[1545.56 --> 1546.34]  and practicing
[1546.34 --> 1547.36]  the way of Jesus
[1547.36 --> 1548.64]  in community
[1548.64 --> 1550.02]  so we become more
[1550.02 --> 1550.74]  and more
[1550.74 --> 1551.44]  and more
[1551.44 --> 1552.14]  and more
[1552.14 --> 1552.80]  and more
[1552.80 --> 1553.46]  like Jesus
[1553.46 --> 1554.14]  for the rest
[1554.14 --> 1554.96]  of your life
[1554.96 --> 1557.10]  knowing that you are
[1557.10 --> 1558.34]  accepted as Jesus
[1558.34 --> 1558.88]  by the Father
[1558.88 --> 1559.92]  because of His grace.
[1565.34 --> 1566.32]  Keep remembering
[1566.32 --> 1567.10]  and remind yourself
[1567.10 --> 1569.28]  the things you do
[1569.28 --> 1571.18]  do something to you.
[1572.00 --> 1573.54]  The things you do
[1573.54 --> 1575.42]  do something to you.
[1580.86 --> 1582.14]  You watch porn?
[1584.02 --> 1586.28]  It does something to you.
[1586.40 --> 1586.54]  Yeah.
[1586.54 --> 1588.50]  More than just what you think.
[1593.92 --> 1595.00]  Things do things.
[1595.20 --> 1595.88]  What you practice
[1595.88 --> 1596.72]  do things to you
[1596.72 --> 1597.74]  for good and for bad.
[1597.88 --> 1599.18]  It all shapes you.
[1602.12 --> 1603.38]  The practice of Jesus,
[1603.48 --> 1604.10]  what do they do to us?
[1604.36 --> 1606.24]  They reorient our lives.
[1607.30 --> 1608.88]  They re-habituate.
[1608.94 --> 1609.54]  There's a great word.
[1609.54 --> 1611.84]  They re-habituate our loves
[1611.84 --> 1612.78]  and our longings
[1612.78 --> 1613.68]  and our attitudes.
[1614.26 --> 1615.50]  That learning to rest,
[1615.50 --> 1617.28]  that learning to refocus,
[1617.56 --> 1619.16]  that learning to spend time
[1619.16 --> 1620.26]  in solitude and silence,
[1620.54 --> 1621.80]  that learning to be in community
[1621.80 --> 1622.80]  with friends and people,
[1623.00 --> 1624.74]  that learning to turn off your phone,
[1624.96 --> 1626.06]  to turn off the media
[1626.06 --> 1628.68]  and just recalibrate.
[1630.84 --> 1633.38]  It changes you.
[1633.38 --> 1639.10]  And you never will do this alone.
[1640.76 --> 1642.38]  Jesus had a group as well.
[1642.54 --> 1643.12]  He had disciples.
[1643.22 --> 1644.00]  You need that too.
[1644.98 --> 1646.20]  Even in this time
[1646.20 --> 1647.22]  where it's hard to get together
[1647.22 --> 1648.22]  because of COVID,
[1648.44 --> 1650.68]  we need to carry on encouragement
[1650.68 --> 1652.74]  and we need to encourage each other
[1652.74 --> 1654.14]  to keep going and keep growing
[1654.14 --> 1654.96]  even in this time.
[1655.24 --> 1656.32]  Maybe that's going to be an email
[1656.32 --> 1657.08]  or a phone call.
[1657.48 --> 1658.20]  Maybe it's going to be standing
[1658.20 --> 1658.98]  on the end of a driveway
[1658.98 --> 1659.22]  and say,
[1659.22 --> 1660.62]  I'm thinking about you,
[1660.92 --> 1661.72]  whatever it is,
[1661.78 --> 1663.30]  you need to stay connected.
[1663.80 --> 1664.18]  And yes,
[1664.38 --> 1665.94]  you need accountability.
[1669.80 --> 1671.14]  So when you get off track,
[1671.20 --> 1672.08]  you can talk to somebody.
[1672.68 --> 1673.56]  Not to be judged,
[1674.04 --> 1674.70]  to be loved
[1674.70 --> 1676.26]  and to be challenged again.
[1676.60 --> 1677.00]  Again,
[1677.16 --> 1678.18]  trusting the Spirit
[1678.18 --> 1679.26]  to be central
[1679.26 --> 1680.88]  in all of this
[1680.88 --> 1684.22]  through the triumphs
[1684.22 --> 1686.60]  and yet through the hardships
[1686.60 --> 1687.74]  and trials of life too.
[1688.30 --> 1689.26]  Knowing God is with us,
[1689.30 --> 1690.48]  He's present in it all,
[1690.90 --> 1692.38]  using it all somehow.
[1694.82 --> 1695.70]  That's why James writes
[1695.70 --> 1697.30]  in the letter of James,
[1697.48 --> 1698.16]  we read this,
[1699.16 --> 1700.42]  talking about trials
[1700.42 --> 1701.34]  and difficulties.
[1701.78 --> 1703.30]  Consider it pure joy,
[1703.38 --> 1704.28]  my brothers and sisters,
[1704.34 --> 1705.18]  when you face trials
[1705.18 --> 1705.78]  of many kinds.
[1705.92 --> 1706.10]  Ooh.
[1706.90 --> 1707.20]  Joy?
[1707.56 --> 1707.92]  Okay.
[1709.30 --> 1710.22]  Because you know
[1710.22 --> 1711.68]  that the testing of your faith
[1711.68 --> 1712.72]  produces perseverance.
[1712.72 --> 1716.52]  Let perseverance finish its work
[1716.52 --> 1717.70]  that you may be,
[1717.76 --> 1718.30]  here we go,
[1718.64 --> 1720.56]  mature and complete,
[1720.98 --> 1722.56]  not lacking anything.
[1722.74 --> 1723.44]  So somehow those,
[1723.54 --> 1724.54]  even those areas of struggle,
[1724.84 --> 1725.60]  those areas of hardship,
[1725.74 --> 1726.48]  those areas of testing,
[1726.80 --> 1728.64]  they are shaping you as well.
[1729.84 --> 1730.64]  Don't be for bad.
[1731.78 --> 1733.24]  I've seen too many people
[1733.24 --> 1735.22]  get stuck in their struggles
[1735.22 --> 1736.64]  and be bitter and angry
[1736.64 --> 1738.94]  or isolate and hide.
[1739.58 --> 1741.06]  They're missing the opportunity
[1741.06 --> 1743.20]  to let God somehow use the struggle
[1743.20 --> 1744.86]  in some way to shape them.
[1745.98 --> 1748.66]  Some of you are in relational struggles right now.
[1748.86 --> 1750.76]  Some of you are dealing with brokenness
[1750.76 --> 1752.20]  in your past or in your present.
[1752.50 --> 1754.14]  Some of you are wrestling with anxiety
[1754.14 --> 1755.32]  or depression or loneliness
[1755.32 --> 1756.40]  or bitterness or addiction.
[1758.06 --> 1759.22]  You might be asking yourself,
[1759.22 --> 1761.92]  is transformation possible for me?
[1764.14 --> 1764.78]  Is it?
[1766.78 --> 1768.22]  Because Sid, talk is cheap.
[1768.28 --> 1769.50]  Is it possible for me?
[1769.80 --> 1771.38]  And I tell you from the bottom of my heart,
[1771.80 --> 1773.42]  yes, it is.
[1773.42 --> 1781.04]  But it involves intentional discipleship
[1781.04 --> 1783.30]  with Jesus in community,
[1783.68 --> 1785.12]  trusting the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1788.40 --> 1789.50]  So let me ask you,
[1790.66 --> 1794.42]  how are you being intentional?
[1795.44 --> 1796.64]  Or are you just floating along,
[1796.74 --> 1797.64]  letting life shape you
[1797.64 --> 1798.80]  however it's going to shape you?
[1798.80 --> 1804.00]  Let me encourage you again.
[1804.28 --> 1806.70]  Try that 10 minutes of silence and solitude.
[1806.84 --> 1807.36]  Just try it.
[1807.68 --> 1808.98]  Meditate on a, each day,
[1809.30 --> 1811.24]  meditate on a phrase or scripture
[1811.24 --> 1812.38]  or a line from a song.
[1813.10 --> 1815.74]  Learn what it is to abide with Jesus.
[1820.94 --> 1822.14]  Maybe start somewhere else.
[1822.32 --> 1823.56]  But I'm encouraging you in that area.
[1823.70 --> 1824.50]  But you can start.
[1824.96 --> 1825.90]  What does it look like
[1825.90 --> 1826.52]  for you to be intentional?
[1826.52 --> 1828.32]  I'm going to end with a question.
[1828.42 --> 1829.76]  I want you to reflect on it this week.
[1831.20 --> 1831.96]  Here's the question.
[1832.80 --> 1835.24]  Who are you becoming?
[1837.08 --> 1837.88]  Who are you becoming?
[1838.96 --> 1840.20]  I want you to look down the road.
[1840.38 --> 1841.62]  Look a year down the road,
[1841.78 --> 1843.04]  two years, five years.
[1843.42 --> 1844.36]  Look down the road.
[1845.00 --> 1847.24]  Do you see Jesus reflected
[1847.24 --> 1849.76]  in who you are becoming?
[1851.30 --> 1852.54]  Or do you see somebody else?
[1852.54 --> 1857.14]  Reflect on that this week.
[1858.10 --> 1859.10]  And be assured,
[1860.16 --> 1863.66]  you can become like Jesus.
[1865.12 --> 1865.86]  Let us pray.
[1869.44 --> 1872.62]  Father God, we come before you.
[1874.30 --> 1875.86]  You've been with us this whole time.
[1875.86 --> 1878.74]  And now we take this particular moment
[1878.74 --> 1879.16]  and we say,
[1879.64 --> 1881.12]  we're so glad to be in your presence, Lord.
[1882.42 --> 1884.20]  We're so glad you're with us all the time.
[1884.24 --> 1886.48]  And we want to live with greater awareness
[1886.48 --> 1888.52]  of your presence with us.
[1888.78 --> 1890.60]  And we want to become more and more like you,
[1890.68 --> 1891.08]  Lord Jesus.
[1891.46 --> 1893.16]  So help us to find the steps.
[1893.40 --> 1894.58]  Not to earn your love.
[1894.62 --> 1895.58]  We already have that.
[1895.80 --> 1897.64]  But to somehow participate
[1897.64 --> 1899.94]  in the transformation you have for us
[1899.94 --> 1901.36]  through the power of your Holy Spirit.
[1901.36 --> 1903.78]  that does involve our lifestyles,
[1903.90 --> 1904.42]  our efforts,
[1905.26 --> 1906.64]  and our community.
[1907.64 --> 1909.46]  Father, I pray you bless each person here
[1909.46 --> 1911.46]  that they might reflect on their own lives.
[1912.82 --> 1914.04]  And they might see
[1914.04 --> 1917.24]  that maybe they're not becoming a whole lot like you
[1917.24 --> 1920.36]  in their actions and in their character.
[1921.26 --> 1922.70]  And might that bring them to a place
[1922.70 --> 1923.90]  where they seek practices.
[1924.58 --> 1925.62]  They seek your presence.
[1926.06 --> 1927.18]  And they seek practices
[1927.18 --> 1929.04]  that bring them into your presence
[1929.04 --> 1931.46]  so that they begin to surrender
[1931.46 --> 1933.22]  and to be active
[1933.22 --> 1936.74]  in building the life you have for them.
[1937.02 --> 1937.76]  In Jesus' name.
[1938.50 --> 1938.76]  Amen.
