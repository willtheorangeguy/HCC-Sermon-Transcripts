[0.00 --> 5.98]  Well, as our kids are heading up to Cornerstone,
[6.30 --> 9.60]  we have these interviews that we're doing
[9.60 --> 11.34]  throughout our series on the Gospel of John
[11.34 --> 13.98]  where we're inviting people to tell the story
[13.98 --> 15.06]  of how they came to believe,
[15.48 --> 17.66]  what brought them to the place of saying Jesus is Lord.
[18.10 --> 19.84]  And this morning we have the privilege of interviewing
[19.84 --> 22.40]  Carrie Hamlin, and I'll invite Carrie up to the front now,
[22.88 --> 24.26]  and she's going to share her story
[24.26 --> 25.82]  of coming to believe in Jesus Christ.
[30.00 --> 41.26]  Well, good morning, Carrie.
[41.56 --> 43.22]  Thanks for being willing to share your story.
[44.86 --> 46.26]  Is your mic on?
[46.40 --> 46.90]  Is it on?
[46.98 --> 47.62]  Oh, hi.
[47.62 --> 47.90]  Okay.
[48.52 --> 49.88]  Well, not everyone knows who you are,
[49.96 --> 51.10]  so say a bit about yourself,
[51.30 --> 52.68]  what you are up to in life, about your family.
[53.20 --> 53.48]  Sure.
[53.68 --> 55.54]  So my name is Carrie Hamlin,
[55.86 --> 58.32]  and I'm married to my wonderful husband, Sean.
[58.32 --> 59.98]  We have four kids.
[60.58 --> 64.04]  Three of them are big, 21, 19, and 17,
[64.24 --> 65.02]  and one of them is little.
[65.18 --> 65.72]  She's seven.
[67.12 --> 69.82]  We moved to BC in 2018.
[70.54 --> 73.18]  Before that we lived in Regina, Saskatchewan,
[73.18 --> 74.88]  and in Alberta.
[75.80 --> 79.84]  And we started coming to Hope in October of 2018.
[81.18 --> 82.66]  I stay at home with my kids.
[82.66 --> 84.62]  We made that decision in 2004,
[85.38 --> 86.54]  when Thomas was a newborn.
[88.04 --> 91.54]  I had previously been a pediatric occupational therapist,
[92.18 --> 94.76]  but we made a great decision.
[95.42 --> 97.92]  And I stayed home, and I took care of my kids,
[97.92 --> 98.90]  and Sean worked.
[99.64 --> 102.64]  And that led to homeschooling for a season,
[103.04 --> 104.76]  and foster parenting for a season,
[105.16 --> 106.64]  and that's where we're at today.
[107.38 --> 107.74]  Okay.
[109.08 --> 110.56]  When would you say you became a Christian?
[111.72 --> 114.60]  I became a Christian relatively later in my life,
[114.64 --> 115.90]  when I was 30 years old.
[116.06 --> 118.06]  So that was 17 years ago now.
[119.68 --> 120.78]  I'm going to ask you the same question
[120.78 --> 122.02]  we asked Dan a couple weeks ago.
[122.82 --> 123.90]  Before you became a Christian,
[124.34 --> 126.54]  what were the assumptions or thoughts you had
[126.54 --> 128.42]  about Christianity and about the church?
[129.42 --> 131.88]  So I grew up in a,
[132.02 --> 135.62]  what I would call a nominally Catholic family.
[135.62 --> 138.28]  What I mean by that is my parents
[138.28 --> 139.62]  called themselves Catholics,
[140.36 --> 141.66]  because they grew up in that tradition.
[143.42 --> 146.22]  So what we did is we went to church on Christmas Eve,
[146.38 --> 147.84]  and we went to church on Easter Sunday.
[148.60 --> 150.34]  And I went to Catholic school,
[150.90 --> 152.62]  and I participated in all the sacraments
[153.14 --> 154.42]  that Catholic kids do.
[155.08 --> 157.84]  But in our home, we did not honor the Lord.
[158.18 --> 159.38]  We didn't mention the Lord.
[159.88 --> 160.86]  We didn't have a Bible.
[161.56 --> 162.38]  We didn't pray.
[162.38 --> 165.98]  We didn't consider the Word of God
[165.98 --> 168.22]  as something to guide your life.
[170.30 --> 173.56]  So that was my experience with religion,
[174.40 --> 175.14]  or Christianity,
[175.62 --> 177.36]  my whole upbringing,
[177.52 --> 178.38]  my whole life, really,
[178.48 --> 179.46]  until I got saved.
[180.44 --> 180.84]  Okay.
[181.00 --> 182.28]  Well, then that makes me ask the question,
[182.36 --> 183.00]  what's the story?
[183.32 --> 184.80]  Tell us some of the key elements
[184.80 --> 186.06]  and the pieces of your life
[186.06 --> 187.78]  that made you and Sean, I think, together,
[188.38 --> 190.24]  say, hey, we want to go further into this faith.
[190.24 --> 191.08]  Yeah.
[191.32 --> 192.72]  So I thought about this,
[192.78 --> 195.40]  and I'm up here because Dave's my friend,
[195.50 --> 196.72]  and I agreed to do this.
[197.34 --> 197.90]  But...
[197.90 --> 199.22]  I didn't twist her arm that much.
[201.70 --> 202.18]  Okay.
[202.26 --> 204.44]  Standing up in here and singing is really nerve-wracking,
[204.54 --> 205.52]  but this is way worse.
[206.54 --> 208.12]  So what happened was,
[208.28 --> 209.48]  I've thought about this,
[209.52 --> 212.30]  and I've divided into sort of three parts.
[212.30 --> 214.74]  Part one was,
[215.40 --> 219.98]  I was home with three kids under the age of four.
[220.58 --> 222.14]  And so I know some of you young moms
[222.14 --> 223.84]  know what that feels like.
[224.20 --> 225.66]  And I was really struggling,
[225.66 --> 227.76]  and I did not have the Lord.
[228.54 --> 230.64]  So try doing that without the Lord.
[231.22 --> 232.58]  I really was struggling.
[232.84 --> 233.84]  Sean was working a lot.
[235.24 --> 238.40]  And now I recognize I really had come to the end
[238.40 --> 240.74]  of what I could accomplish in my own strength.
[240.74 --> 241.86]  I was just done.
[242.52 --> 244.46]  And I had this little tug in my heart,
[244.60 --> 244.86]  like,
[245.82 --> 247.26]  it's time to go back to church,
[247.92 --> 250.12]  but not Catholic church.
[250.62 --> 252.06]  That was really clear to me.
[252.74 --> 253.84]  In my neighborhood,
[253.84 --> 255.12]  there was a big,
[255.28 --> 256.78]  mega church,
[257.24 --> 259.84]  like a Six Flags Over Jesus church.
[260.74 --> 261.04]  Okay?
[261.04 --> 263.12]  And they would send out
[263.12 --> 263.96]  these beautiful,
[264.12 --> 265.64]  glossy postcards
[265.64 --> 266.94]  inviting the neighborhood.
[267.66 --> 269.12]  So I said to Sean one day,
[269.20 --> 269.86]  I have to go.
[269.94 --> 270.74]  I have to go to church.
[270.76 --> 272.00]  And he stayed home with the kids.
[272.86 --> 273.92]  When I went in there,
[274.04 --> 276.08]  that was nothing like I'd ever experienced
[276.08 --> 277.36]  coming out of Catholicism.
[277.92 --> 279.00]  Everything was different.
[279.18 --> 279.70]  The worship,
[280.36 --> 281.08]  the praying,
[281.38 --> 282.00]  the preaching,
[282.80 --> 283.24]  everything.
[283.86 --> 284.02]  Now,
[284.08 --> 285.96]  I don't remember anything about the sermon,
[285.96 --> 287.52]  but I was sitting alone
[287.52 --> 289.04]  in this huge assembly
[289.04 --> 291.02]  and I wept.
[291.76 --> 293.02]  I just remember crying.
[293.16 --> 294.60]  I was so broken.
[295.60 --> 297.32]  I just sat and wept and wept.
[297.52 --> 298.30]  That's part one.
[299.18 --> 300.00]  Part two
[300.00 --> 301.78]  is called the alpha course.
[302.62 --> 303.44]  So the next
[303.44 --> 304.92]  little while,
[305.04 --> 306.36]  Sean and I attended that church
[306.36 --> 308.34]  and we went to an alpha course.
[308.46 --> 309.18]  And I don't know if you guys
[309.18 --> 310.20]  are familiar with it,
[310.20 --> 312.26]  but probably like
[312.26 --> 314.28]  lesson one or two is
[314.28 --> 315.80]  you are a sinner
[315.80 --> 317.10]  and you're born in sin.
[317.88 --> 318.40]  Guess what?
[318.46 --> 319.42]  I had never heard that
[319.42 --> 320.92]  a day in my life.
[321.08 --> 322.12]  I was 30 years old.
[322.52 --> 324.04]  I had no idea I was a sinner.
[324.94 --> 325.34]  None.
[325.50 --> 327.00]  I thought I was doing pretty good.
[328.00 --> 330.04]  I had a very feminist,
[330.64 --> 331.50]  modern mom.
[332.30 --> 332.68]  Like,
[332.68 --> 333.38]  I'm okay.
[333.50 --> 334.14]  You're okay.
[334.32 --> 335.34]  You're a good person.
[335.90 --> 337.14]  There's good in everybody.
[338.40 --> 339.50]  So when I found out
[339.50 --> 340.06]  I was a sinner,
[340.20 --> 342.30]  I was blown away
[342.30 --> 342.92]  and shocked.
[343.70 --> 344.82]  That was the moment
[344.82 --> 345.86]  where I recognized
[345.86 --> 347.40]  that I needed saving.
[347.56 --> 348.28]  I didn't know that.
[348.92 --> 350.28]  The good news of the gospel
[350.28 --> 352.06]  was lost on me
[352.06 --> 353.46]  because I didn't know
[353.46 --> 354.28]  the bad news,
[354.40 --> 354.82]  which was
[354.82 --> 356.48]  you need a savior.
[356.72 --> 357.14]  You're a sinner.
[357.66 --> 358.82]  So I was just broken
[358.82 --> 359.86]  over by sin
[359.86 --> 362.08]  and that's when I got saved.
[362.88 --> 364.18]  But then there's part three
[364.18 --> 366.06]  and this part's called
[366.06 --> 366.78]  Pastor Vern.
[367.76 --> 368.92]  So in our neighborhood,
[369.14 --> 370.06]  I'm going to cry now.
[370.20 --> 370.68]  Wow.
[371.08 --> 372.62]  God gave us
[372.62 --> 373.60]  a neighbor
[373.60 --> 376.12]  who was a beautiful
[376.12 --> 377.72]  old Baptist preacher
[377.72 --> 379.60]  and he preached
[379.60 --> 380.62]  in his living room
[380.62 --> 382.08]  to about 10 people
[382.08 --> 382.92]  every Sunday morning.
[383.88 --> 385.12]  One Easter,
[385.36 --> 386.32]  I invited him
[386.32 --> 386.84]  to come
[386.84 --> 388.04]  to our big
[388.04 --> 388.98]  mega church
[388.98 --> 390.60]  Easter extravaganza
[390.60 --> 392.24]  and he said,
[392.34 --> 392.90]  no thanks.
[392.90 --> 396.96]  But he did say,
[397.08 --> 397.88]  let me come over
[397.88 --> 399.32]  and chat with you guys
[399.32 --> 400.82]  and he did that.
[401.42 --> 402.50]  He sat at our
[402.50 --> 403.50]  kitchen table
[403.50 --> 404.74]  and he shared
[404.74 --> 405.84]  the gospel with us,
[405.90 --> 406.86]  which I'd never heard.
[408.12 --> 409.70]  And from then on,
[409.78 --> 410.86]  from that day forward,
[411.00 --> 411.58]  we attended
[411.58 --> 413.24]  his little house church.
[413.82 --> 415.16]  Every Sunday morning,
[415.34 --> 415.82]  he would look
[415.82 --> 416.42]  through the window.
[416.86 --> 418.26]  We'd be across the street
[418.26 --> 419.16]  trying to get the kids
[419.16 --> 419.72]  out the door.
[419.72 --> 421.54]  Sometimes it was just us
[421.54 --> 422.26]  in the living room.
[423.14 --> 424.14]  He was a gifted
[424.14 --> 426.00]  expositor of the scripture.
[426.68 --> 427.84]  He loved the Lord.
[428.06 --> 429.22]  He loved the word.
[429.66 --> 430.84]  He loved to pray.
[431.32 --> 432.10]  He became
[432.10 --> 433.26]  sort of a surrogate
[433.26 --> 434.84]  grandparent to our kids.
[435.56 --> 435.96]  He was
[435.96 --> 438.08]  very instrumental
[438.08 --> 439.70]  in pointing Sean and I
[439.70 --> 441.30]  to the scriptures
[441.30 --> 442.70]  and growing our faith.
[442.70 --> 444.58]  And he stayed that way
[444.58 --> 445.16]  all the way
[445.16 --> 445.96]  until he went
[445.96 --> 447.20]  home to be with the Lord
[447.20 --> 448.60]  in 2019.
[448.72 --> 449.92]  And he missed COVID,
[450.44 --> 451.42]  which I think is a blessing.
[452.66 --> 453.52]  He never would have
[453.52 --> 454.12]  stayed inside.
[457.78 --> 458.18]  Wow.
[458.26 --> 458.96]  There's like a number
[458.96 --> 459.60]  of things you shared
[459.60 --> 460.12]  there that are really
[460.12 --> 460.66]  significant.
[460.92 --> 461.16]  I mean,
[461.94 --> 464.16]  just an interesting
[464.16 --> 465.66]  reflection for me
[465.66 --> 466.32]  is that there was
[466.32 --> 467.20]  a movement in the church,
[467.30 --> 468.18]  especially mega churches
[468.18 --> 468.86]  for a while,
[468.92 --> 469.54]  where we're like,
[469.92 --> 470.86]  we probably shouldn't
[470.86 --> 471.66]  talk about sin
[471.66 --> 472.62]  because people don't
[472.62 --> 473.10]  like that.
[473.48 --> 474.78]  And it's not attractive
[474.78 --> 475.78]  to make people
[475.78 --> 476.50]  want to become Christians.
[476.76 --> 477.56]  And what I'm hearing you say
[477.56 --> 478.88]  is learning about sin
[478.88 --> 480.32]  is a huge part
[480.32 --> 481.42]  of what made you
[481.42 --> 482.48]  decide to become a Christian.
[482.68 --> 483.18]  So that's just really
[483.18 --> 484.22]  significant for me
[484.22 --> 484.54]  as a pastor.
[486.68 --> 487.32]  I mean,
[487.48 --> 488.20]  secondly,
[488.30 --> 489.00]  I think it's really interesting
[489.00 --> 489.48]  that you move from
[489.48 --> 489.98]  a mega church
[489.98 --> 490.54]  to a house church
[490.54 --> 491.54]  right across the road
[491.54 --> 492.14]  from your house.
[492.26 --> 492.40]  I mean,
[492.44 --> 493.20]  talk about accountability.
[493.40 --> 494.32]  He's just waiting for you,
[494.46 --> 495.26]  looking through the windows.
[495.90 --> 496.80]  You can't sleep in
[496.80 --> 497.92]  and not be seen.
[500.02 --> 500.18]  Yeah.
[500.48 --> 500.88]  I mean,
[500.88 --> 502.92]  there's a lot of questions
[502.92 --> 503.44]  I want to ask,
[503.54 --> 503.92]  but I want to,
[504.78 --> 505.48]  relationally,
[505.54 --> 506.00]  what was it like
[506.00 --> 506.72]  for you and Sean?
[507.54 --> 507.92]  I mean,
[507.98 --> 509.06]  going through this journey
[509.06 --> 509.62]  of being Christian
[509.62 --> 510.36]  together as a couple
[510.36 --> 511.20]  in your 30s.
[512.40 --> 513.70]  It was transformational.
[513.84 --> 514.02]  Like,
[514.04 --> 515.10]  I was thinking about
[515.10 --> 516.50]  scripture verses
[516.50 --> 518.54]  and I had a verse
[518.54 --> 519.70]  on my license plate
[519.70 --> 520.80]  all the years
[520.80 --> 521.86]  we lived in Saskatchewan,
[521.94 --> 522.38]  which was
[522.38 --> 524.64]  2 Corinthians 5.17,
[525.38 --> 526.22]  which says,
[526.32 --> 526.58]  you know,
[526.68 --> 527.52]  if you are in Christ,
[527.60 --> 528.48]  you are a new creature.
[528.96 --> 530.20]  And that's how we felt.
[530.20 --> 531.24]  We were new creatures.
[532.08 --> 532.24]  Like,
[532.48 --> 533.28]  our poor kids,
[533.36 --> 533.96]  especially Sydney,
[534.06 --> 535.02]  she was 6 years old.
[535.26 --> 536.00]  Her whole world
[536.00 --> 536.74]  just changed.
[536.90 --> 537.08]  Like,
[537.70 --> 538.36]  we can't have
[538.36 --> 539.18]  trick-or-treating,
[539.40 --> 539.56]  like,
[539.62 --> 539.96]  everything.
[540.08 --> 540.40]  She's like,
[540.42 --> 540.60]  oh,
[540.62 --> 541.60]  I hate Pastor Byrne
[541.60 --> 541.92]  because,
[542.02 --> 542.14]  you know,
[542.22 --> 543.28]  everything changed
[543.28 --> 544.62]  overnight for her.
[544.70 --> 545.38]  Tom was younger,
[545.54 --> 546.58]  so it was a little bit
[546.58 --> 547.14]  more natural,
[547.28 --> 550.36]  but it was a dramatic change.
[550.46 --> 552.06]  We were very worldly people.
[552.52 --> 553.40]  And then it was just
[553.40 --> 554.16]  upside down.
[554.70 --> 556.22]  The world changed for us
[556.22 --> 557.32]  in the best way,
[557.40 --> 557.68]  of course.
[557.68 --> 559.72]  So,
[559.78 --> 559.88]  I mean,
[559.92 --> 560.98]  based on your own experience
[560.98 --> 562.18]  of becoming a Christian,
[562.94 --> 564.30]  what would you say
[564.30 --> 565.54]  to the church this morning
[565.54 --> 567.08]  about evangelism,
[567.76 --> 569.14]  about how to share the faith,
[569.58 --> 570.20]  things that you think
[570.20 --> 570.96]  are really important
[570.96 --> 572.60]  for churches and Christians
[572.60 --> 573.28]  to think about
[573.28 --> 573.84]  when they're talking
[573.84 --> 574.34]  to their friends,
[574.46 --> 574.76]  the neighbors,
[574.86 --> 575.50]  the people they love?
[575.50 --> 576.62]  So,
[576.72 --> 577.34]  I've thought a lot
[577.34 --> 577.96]  about this
[577.96 --> 580.48]  because I really believe
[580.48 --> 581.20]  in the sovereignty
[581.20 --> 582.28]  of God and salvation.
[583.10 --> 585.96]  I believe we can sow seeds,
[586.16 --> 587.66]  but He's going to do the work.
[588.28 --> 588.50]  And so,
[588.54 --> 589.64]  I think there's such a variety
[589.64 --> 590.72]  of ways that we can do that.
[590.78 --> 593.02]  And I have done a lot of things
[593.02 --> 594.42]  over the years.
[594.58 --> 596.00]  Pastor Byrne used to have us
[596.00 --> 597.04]  delivering tracts.
[597.60 --> 598.04]  Again,
[598.12 --> 599.06]  my poor little kiddos,
[599.20 --> 599.36]  like,
[599.74 --> 600.60]  dragging them through
[600.60 --> 601.16]  the neighborhoods
[601.16 --> 601.90]  in Edmonton,
[602.06 --> 602.92]  dropping tracts
[602.92 --> 604.08]  and mailboxes.
[604.88 --> 606.50]  Back before audio streaming,
[606.62 --> 608.16]  I used to burn CDs
[608.16 --> 608.94]  of sermons.
[609.66 --> 610.42]  One that I loved
[610.42 --> 610.78]  was, like,
[610.84 --> 611.86]  the 10 indictments
[611.86 --> 613.14]  against the modern church,
[613.16 --> 614.22]  and I would give that out
[614.22 --> 614.86]  to pastors
[614.86 --> 615.78]  and people that I knew.
[615.86 --> 616.52]  I mean, it's horrible, really.
[616.52 --> 617.22]  You give it to pastors?
[617.28 --> 617.64]  Yes.
[618.60 --> 619.04]  Wow.
[619.26 --> 619.44]  You know,
[619.46 --> 620.28]  you're just on fire
[620.28 --> 621.60]  at that point in your faith.
[623.60 --> 624.16]  You know,
[624.24 --> 624.60]  recently,
[624.76 --> 626.14]  I had a two-hour conversation
[626.14 --> 627.16]  with my father-in-law
[627.16 --> 628.16]  in our hot tub,
[628.84 --> 629.64]  just talking about
[629.64 --> 630.50]  the gospel
[630.50 --> 631.42]  and Jesus
[631.42 --> 632.10]  and the truth
[632.10 --> 632.76]  of the Bible.
[632.92 --> 634.14]  And so there's been,
[634.26 --> 634.34]  like,
[634.40 --> 635.44]  lots of different ways
[635.44 --> 636.20]  over the years
[636.20 --> 636.88]  that we've,
[637.12 --> 637.64]  that I've tried
[637.64 --> 638.44]  to share my faith,
[638.54 --> 640.36]  but probably the most
[640.36 --> 642.34]  impactful recently
[642.34 --> 643.80]  has been our journey
[643.80 --> 644.82]  into foster care
[644.82 --> 646.76]  because we're entering
[646.76 --> 647.88]  into this season
[647.88 --> 649.60]  where our contemporaries,
[649.80 --> 650.86]  Sean's work contemporaries
[650.86 --> 651.26]  especially,
[652.10 --> 652.54]  are, like,
[652.56 --> 653.54]  their kids are grown.
[654.50 --> 655.44]  They're starting to, like,
[655.48 --> 656.42]  enjoy the fruits
[656.42 --> 657.56]  of all these years
[657.56 --> 658.18]  of work.
[658.50 --> 659.36]  They're starting to do
[659.36 --> 660.06]  wine tours
[660.06 --> 660.96]  in the Napa Valley
[660.96 --> 662.12]  and things like that.
[662.12 --> 663.22]  And Sean and I
[663.22 --> 664.14]  are walking the floor
[664.14 --> 664.82]  with, like,
[664.84 --> 665.84]  a little drug-addicted
[665.84 --> 666.88]  newborn baby
[666.88 --> 667.44]  that belongs
[667.44 --> 668.34]  to somebody else.
[669.14 --> 670.64]  And when people hear that,
[671.02 --> 671.54]  they want to know
[671.54 --> 672.02]  about that.
[672.60 --> 673.38]  Why are you guys
[673.38 --> 674.10]  doing that?
[674.66 --> 675.38]  And the answer
[675.38 --> 675.92]  is Jesus.
[676.38 --> 676.66]  You know,
[676.74 --> 677.46]  he told us
[677.46 --> 678.36]  to care for the widow
[678.36 --> 678.96]  and the orphan.
[679.84 --> 681.22]  And that's what we're doing.
[681.34 --> 682.38]  And then it points them
[682.38 --> 682.94]  to God.
[683.48 --> 684.08]  So I feel like
[684.08 --> 684.74]  there's seeds
[684.74 --> 685.94]  that were planted
[685.94 --> 686.76]  in my life
[686.76 --> 687.82]  inside of a dead
[687.82 --> 689.70]  Catholic faith upbringing.
[689.70 --> 692.46]  I was convinced
[692.46 --> 692.98]  that the Bible
[692.98 --> 693.50]  was real.
[693.62 --> 694.52]  I knew God was real.
[694.62 --> 695.04]  I learned that
[695.04 --> 695.82]  at Catholic school.
[697.60 --> 697.88]  I mean,
[697.94 --> 698.48]  we had people
[698.48 --> 699.54]  cross our paths
[699.54 --> 701.02]  that were true Christians.
[701.18 --> 701.72]  Our realtor,
[701.80 --> 702.24]  remember, Sean,
[702.30 --> 703.42]  from our first house
[703.42 --> 703.90]  that we bought
[703.90 --> 704.56]  was a Christian.
[704.92 --> 705.92]  We'd never met a Christian.
[706.46 --> 707.64]  He was so compelling.
[708.04 --> 708.70]  We were just like,
[708.74 --> 709.78]  what is with this guy?
[709.82 --> 710.76]  He was so kind,
[711.34 --> 712.28]  so honest.
[712.76 --> 713.50]  So there's, like,
[713.52 --> 715.04]  little moments in time
[715.04 --> 715.68]  and little seeds.
[715.68 --> 716.52]  So I just feel like
[716.52 --> 717.90]  we should just plant seeds
[717.90 --> 719.30]  and then let God
[719.30 --> 720.54]  do his work.
[723.34 --> 724.04]  Well, I want to pray
[724.04 --> 724.52]  for you, Carrie.
[724.72 --> 725.56]  I want to praise the Lord.
[725.84 --> 726.40]  Sean, too.
[726.86 --> 727.94]  I see your kids
[727.94 --> 728.56]  in front of me here.
[728.72 --> 729.44]  I'm just so thankful
[729.44 --> 730.30]  that God has been
[730.30 --> 731.22]  at work in your lives.
[731.74 --> 732.46]  And not only for the way
[732.46 --> 733.36]  he led you to our church,
[733.42 --> 734.54]  but the way that you serve.
[734.80 --> 735.88]  I'm amazed by the ways
[735.88 --> 736.68]  that you want to get involved
[736.68 --> 737.38]  and use your gifts.
[737.54 --> 738.24]  And we praise the Lord
[738.24 --> 738.62]  for that.
[738.78 --> 739.52]  So I want to give thanks
[739.52 --> 739.70]  for that.
[739.74 --> 740.60]  I also want to pray
[740.60 --> 741.94]  for the evangelism
[741.94 --> 742.42]  of our church.
[742.42 --> 743.38]  So join me in prayer.
[743.38 --> 746.20]  Lord, we thank you
[746.20 --> 747.28]  for yet another story
[747.28 --> 748.20]  of how your spirit
[748.20 --> 748.76]  was at work
[748.76 --> 750.24]  in the Hamelin home.
[751.44 --> 752.02]  We thank you
[752.02 --> 752.82]  for the way that
[752.82 --> 754.18]  the scriptures came alive
[754.18 --> 755.62]  and the salvation
[755.62 --> 756.76]  of Jesus became real.
[757.66 --> 758.44]  Thank you for the way
[758.44 --> 759.30]  that knowledge of sin
[759.30 --> 759.98]  became something
[759.98 --> 761.16]  that led to a need
[761.16 --> 761.70]  for a savior.
[763.38 --> 763.62]  And Lord,
[763.66 --> 764.36]  I just want to pray
[764.36 --> 765.30]  over their family
[765.30 --> 766.18]  as they serve
[766.18 --> 766.98]  and especially
[766.98 --> 767.70]  as they foster
[767.70 --> 769.10]  that the good news
[769.10 --> 769.46]  of Christ
[769.46 --> 769.98]  will be planted
[769.98 --> 770.44]  in the hearts
[770.44 --> 770.86]  of the children
[770.86 --> 771.52]  they care for.
[772.88 --> 773.16]  And Lord,
[773.16 --> 773.62]  I want to pray
[773.62 --> 774.32]  for our church
[774.32 --> 776.20]  that we would find ways
[776.20 --> 776.84]  that are authentic
[776.84 --> 777.78]  and honest
[777.78 --> 779.58]  and true to the gospel
[779.58 --> 780.32]  as we speak
[780.32 --> 781.64]  and live the faith
[781.64 --> 782.00]  of Jesus.
[783.22 --> 783.94]  I ask that you
[783.94 --> 784.70]  give us opportunities
[784.70 --> 785.76]  to make known
[785.76 --> 786.42]  the love of Jesus
[786.42 --> 786.96]  in justice,
[787.92 --> 788.50]  in mercy,
[789.44 --> 790.48]  in small acts
[790.48 --> 791.10]  of compassion.
[791.96 --> 792.22]  And Lord,
[792.28 --> 793.04]  use our words
[793.04 --> 794.30]  to make known
[794.30 --> 794.88]  the good news
[794.88 --> 795.30]  of Christ.
[796.20 --> 796.90]  We pray all this
[796.90 --> 797.66]  in your mighty name.
[797.86 --> 798.10]  Amen.
[799.20 --> 799.92]  Thank you, Carrie.
[799.92 --> 800.92]  Thank you.
[800.92 --> 801.92]  Thank you.
[804.38 --> 805.98]  Each time we live in
[805.98 --> 807.46]  where taking off
[807.46 --> 808.38]  your mask
[808.38 --> 809.14]  is a privilege.
[810.24 --> 810.66]  Sorry,
[810.74 --> 811.26]  I get to enjoy
[811.26 --> 811.80]  that privilege
[811.80 --> 812.38]  in front of you,
[812.48 --> 813.00]  but now I can
[813.00 --> 813.68]  actually breathe
[813.68 --> 814.18]  and so
[814.18 --> 815.86]  I'm going to need
[815.86 --> 816.28]  my breath
[816.28 --> 817.14]  for my sermon
[817.14 --> 817.66]  this morning
[817.66 --> 818.60]  and so please,
[819.14 --> 820.16]  yeah.
[822.10 --> 823.02]  Just want to say
[823.02 --> 823.80]  good morning again.
[823.92 --> 824.56]  I know we've said
[824.56 --> 824.94]  good morning
[824.94 --> 825.56]  many times
[825.56 --> 826.52]  today,
[826.72 --> 827.66]  but good morning,
[827.66 --> 828.00]  Hope.
[829.00 --> 830.16]  It is my privilege
[830.16 --> 831.36]  to be able to share
[831.36 --> 832.28]  God's word with you
[832.28 --> 832.84]  this morning
[832.84 --> 834.02]  and so,
[834.62 --> 834.78]  yeah,
[834.82 --> 835.80]  I haven't spoken
[835.80 --> 837.30]  in a long time
[837.30 --> 838.68]  and for those of you
[838.68 --> 839.60]  who may not know me,
[839.78 --> 840.92]  my name is Jonathan Huang
[840.92 --> 843.08]  and I am the pastoral
[843.08 --> 844.36]  intern here at Hope.
[847.70 --> 848.14]  Yeah,
[848.24 --> 848.92]  this is not part
[848.92 --> 849.32]  of my sermon,
[849.48 --> 850.62]  but Carrie's testimony
[850.62 --> 851.70]  really touched me today.
[851.80 --> 852.86]  I was actually in tears.
[853.34 --> 853.72]  I don't know
[853.72 --> 854.22]  if you've noticed,
[854.36 --> 855.42]  but I'm an emotional guy
[855.42 --> 856.78]  and so I do cry a lot.
[857.66 --> 859.86]  But there were so many things
[859.86 --> 861.14]  that I could relate to
[861.14 --> 862.46]  and that house church
[862.46 --> 863.90]  with Pastor Vern
[863.90 --> 865.16]  and how,
[865.52 --> 865.64]  yeah,
[865.74 --> 866.32]  my dad
[866.32 --> 867.54]  starting off
[867.54 --> 868.44]  as a house church
[868.44 --> 869.74]  and pastoring
[869.74 --> 871.16]  to Korean immigrants here,
[871.46 --> 872.22]  the small amount
[872.22 --> 873.22]  of Korean immigrants
[873.22 --> 874.30]  that lived in Abbotsford
[874.30 --> 875.50]  and so,
[875.64 --> 875.84]  yeah,
[875.98 --> 877.62]  it was very powerful
[877.62 --> 878.58]  and I'm very thankful
[878.58 --> 880.10]  for Carrie's testimony
[880.10 --> 882.42]  and how that blesses us.
[883.04 --> 883.50]  And so,
[883.76 --> 884.64]  we are blessed
[884.64 --> 886.10]  with different seeds
[886.10 --> 886.94]  and today,
[887.36 --> 888.52]  I want to continue
[888.52 --> 889.54]  in our sermon series
[889.54 --> 891.82]  on John chapter 5
[891.82 --> 892.48]  and so,
[892.60 --> 893.42]  if you have your Bibles
[893.42 --> 894.50]  with you
[894.50 --> 895.60]  or if you have your app,
[896.24 --> 896.86]  could you please
[896.86 --> 897.64]  turn with me
[897.64 --> 899.32]  to John chapter 5.
[907.92 --> 908.72]  And so,
[909.06 --> 909.84]  I will read
[909.84 --> 911.20]  John chapter 5.
[911.20 --> 915.12]  Some time later,
[915.36 --> 916.14]  Jesus went up
[916.14 --> 916.86]  to Jerusalem
[916.86 --> 918.48]  for one of the Jewish festivals.
[919.52 --> 919.76]  Now,
[919.86 --> 920.90]  there is in Jerusalem
[920.90 --> 921.90]  near the Sheep Gate
[921.90 --> 922.42]  a pool,
[922.66 --> 923.48]  which in Aramaic
[923.48 --> 924.60]  is called Bethesda,
[925.00 --> 925.82]  Bethesda,
[926.26 --> 927.28]  and which is surrounded
[927.28 --> 928.72]  by five covered colonnades.
[929.52 --> 929.84]  Here,
[929.98 --> 930.76]  a great number
[930.76 --> 931.94]  of disabled people
[931.94 --> 932.70]  used to lie,
[933.26 --> 933.82]  the blind,
[933.94 --> 934.32]  the lame,
[934.40 --> 934.84]  the paralyzed.
[935.88 --> 937.08]  One was there
[937.08 --> 938.70]  who had been invalid
[938.70 --> 940.10]  for 38 years.
[941.12 --> 942.14]  When Jesus saw him
[942.14 --> 942.66]  lying there
[942.66 --> 943.08]  and learned
[943.08 --> 943.84]  that he had been
[943.84 --> 944.62]  in this condition
[944.62 --> 945.58]  for a long time,
[945.90 --> 946.62]  he asked him,
[947.48 --> 947.92]  do you want
[947.92 --> 948.46]  to get well?
[949.52 --> 949.96]  Sir,
[950.20 --> 951.24]  the invalid replied,
[951.62 --> 952.30]  I have no one
[952.30 --> 952.78]  to help me
[952.78 --> 953.36]  into the pool
[953.36 --> 954.40]  when the water
[954.40 --> 954.94]  is stirred.
[955.44 --> 956.18]  While I'm trying
[956.18 --> 956.72]  to get in,
[956.82 --> 957.30]  someone else
[957.30 --> 958.22]  goes ahead of me.
[959.14 --> 960.44]  Then Jesus said to him,
[960.70 --> 961.14]  get up,
[961.92 --> 962.64]  pick up your mat
[962.64 --> 963.12]  and walk.
[964.32 --> 965.00]  At once,
[965.10 --> 966.16]  the man was cured.
[966.64 --> 967.18]  He picked up
[967.18 --> 968.60]  his mat and walked.
[969.28 --> 970.14]  The day on which
[970.14 --> 971.04]  this took place
[971.04 --> 971.72]  was the Sabbath.
[972.76 --> 973.18]  And so,
[973.28 --> 974.00]  the Jewish leader
[974.00 --> 974.84]  said to the man
[974.84 --> 975.80]  who had been healed,
[976.16 --> 976.90]  it's the Sabbath.
[977.14 --> 978.02]  The law forbids you
[978.02 --> 978.82]  to carry your mat.
[979.38 --> 980.26]  But he replied,
[980.96 --> 982.22]  the man who made me well
[982.22 --> 982.86]  said to me,
[983.64 --> 984.38]  pick up your mat
[984.38 --> 984.86]  and walk.
[985.46 --> 986.18]  So they asked him,
[986.28 --> 986.92]  who is this fellow
[986.92 --> 988.06]  who told you
[988.06 --> 988.82]  to pick up your mat
[988.82 --> 989.24]  and walk?
[990.34 --> 991.78]  The man who was healed
[991.78 --> 992.50]  had no idea
[992.50 --> 993.14]  who it was,
[993.24 --> 994.16]  for Jesus had slipped
[994.16 --> 995.14]  away into the crowd
[995.14 --> 996.68]  that was there.
[998.08 --> 998.42]  Later,
[998.56 --> 999.28]  Jesus found him
[999.28 --> 999.80]  at the temple
[999.80 --> 1000.86]  and said to him,
[1001.34 --> 1002.32]  see you are well.
[1003.08 --> 1003.88]  Stop sinning
[1003.88 --> 1004.62]  or something worse
[1004.62 --> 1005.38]  may happen to you.
[1006.46 --> 1007.70]  The man went away
[1007.70 --> 1008.86]  and told the Jewish leaders
[1008.86 --> 1009.80]  that it was Jesus
[1009.80 --> 1011.08]  who had made him well.
[1012.26 --> 1012.54]  And so,
[1012.70 --> 1013.96]  because Jesus was doing
[1013.96 --> 1014.58]  these things
[1014.58 --> 1015.10]  on the Sabbath,
[1015.60 --> 1016.32]  the Jewish leaders
[1016.32 --> 1017.46]  began to persecute him.
[1018.12 --> 1018.92]  In his defense,
[1019.10 --> 1019.94]  Jesus said to them,
[1020.76 --> 1022.20]  my father is always
[1022.20 --> 1022.70]  at work
[1022.70 --> 1023.78]  to this very day,
[1023.78 --> 1024.84]  even on a Sabbath,
[1024.84 --> 1026.12]  and I too
[1026.12 --> 1026.76]  am working.
[1028.06 --> 1028.82]  For this reason,
[1028.92 --> 1030.00]  they tried all the more
[1030.00 --> 1030.54]  to kill him.
[1030.96 --> 1034.28]  Not only was he
[1034.28 --> 1035.06]  breaking the Sabbath,
[1035.38 --> 1036.06]  but he was even
[1036.06 --> 1036.74]  calling God
[1036.74 --> 1037.64]  his own father,
[1037.96 --> 1038.66]  making himself
[1038.66 --> 1039.58]  equal with God.
[1040.70 --> 1041.40]  Jesus gave them
[1041.40 --> 1042.02]  this answer,
[1042.74 --> 1043.34]  very truly,
[1043.52 --> 1044.20]  very truly,
[1044.34 --> 1044.90]  I tell you,
[1045.14 --> 1045.94]  the son can do
[1045.94 --> 1047.08]  nothing by himself.
[1047.50 --> 1048.34]  He can do only
[1048.34 --> 1049.02]  what he sees
[1049.02 --> 1049.78]  the father doing,
[1049.78 --> 1051.40]  his father doing,
[1051.40 --> 1052.44]  because whatever
[1052.44 --> 1053.40]  the father does,
[1053.72 --> 1055.56]  the son also does.
[1056.68 --> 1057.02]  Amen.
[1061.76 --> 1063.20]  Through our passage today,
[1063.28 --> 1064.16]  I want to note
[1064.16 --> 1065.62]  that Jesus sets,
[1065.92 --> 1067.68]  the healing story,
[1067.84 --> 1068.06]  I mean,
[1068.44 --> 1069.36]  sets the stage
[1069.36 --> 1069.86]  for Jesus'
[1070.22 --> 1071.24]  identification
[1071.24 --> 1072.22]  and claim
[1072.22 --> 1073.60]  of his own sonship
[1073.60 --> 1074.74]  in relation to the father,
[1075.20 --> 1076.28]  to his father.
[1077.36 --> 1077.72]  Now,
[1077.72 --> 1078.30]  I know we didn't
[1078.30 --> 1078.90]  read it together,
[1079.18 --> 1080.14]  but in verse 24
[1080.14 --> 1081.20]  of the same chapter,
[1081.40 --> 1083.26]  it echoes John 3, 16,
[1083.52 --> 1084.34]  when Jesus says,
[1084.70 --> 1085.88]  whoever hears my word
[1085.88 --> 1086.92]  and believes in him
[1086.92 --> 1087.70]  who sent me
[1087.70 --> 1089.16]  has eternal life.
[1089.96 --> 1091.54]  It is about eternal life.
[1092.70 --> 1093.86]  And I hope you remember
[1093.86 --> 1095.38]  that in his gospel account,
[1095.64 --> 1097.40]  in John's gospel account,
[1097.76 --> 1098.94]  he doesn't hold back,
[1099.00 --> 1100.46]  but he starts off
[1100.46 --> 1101.10]  with the finale.
[1101.82 --> 1103.74]  And remember Dave's analogy,
[1103.84 --> 1104.36]  his imagery,
[1104.72 --> 1105.30]  where the fireworks,
[1105.70 --> 1106.28]  at the beginning
[1106.28 --> 1107.20]  of the fireworks show,
[1107.32 --> 1108.50]  somebody accidentally
[1108.50 --> 1109.50]  pushes the button
[1109.50 --> 1110.44]  to blow off
[1110.44 --> 1111.22]  all the fireworks
[1111.22 --> 1112.00]  at the same time.
[1112.64 --> 1113.76]  It starts off
[1113.76 --> 1114.44]  with the finale.
[1116.08 --> 1117.56]  Jesus is the word.
[1118.30 --> 1119.34]  He was in the beginning.
[1119.50 --> 1120.38]  He was with God
[1120.38 --> 1121.88]  and he was God.
[1122.28 --> 1124.20]  That is the main point.
[1124.88 --> 1125.72]  That is what Jesus
[1125.72 --> 1127.10]  is trying to identify
[1127.10 --> 1129.26]  and reveal for us
[1129.26 --> 1131.28]  who witness his word today.
[1131.28 --> 1133.82]  Now, I personally have
[1133.82 --> 1135.86]  no good image of fireworks.
[1136.32 --> 1136.96]  I know Sid said
[1136.96 --> 1137.62]  all the preachers
[1137.62 --> 1138.20]  in this series
[1138.20 --> 1139.50]  are going to have to come up
[1139.50 --> 1140.44]  with an image of fireworks.
[1140.54 --> 1141.26]  I don't have any.
[1141.78 --> 1142.90]  I couldn't come up with any
[1142.90 --> 1143.74]  that was fitting
[1143.74 --> 1144.44]  to this passage.
[1144.84 --> 1146.08]  But I do want to share
[1146.08 --> 1147.48]  a little bit more
[1147.48 --> 1148.62]  of a personal aspect
[1148.62 --> 1149.40]  that relates
[1149.40 --> 1151.66]  and hopefully shows you
[1151.66 --> 1153.62]  what state
[1153.62 --> 1155.38]  this paraplegic man was in.
[1155.70 --> 1156.92]  And so this paralyzed man.
[1156.92 --> 1159.66]  So before I get
[1159.66 --> 1160.28]  to this healing,
[1160.96 --> 1162.22]  I actually received
[1162.22 --> 1163.02]  a couple of questions
[1163.02 --> 1163.64]  from the youth
[1163.64 --> 1164.16]  this week
[1164.16 --> 1165.58]  on John 5.
[1166.58 --> 1167.96]  One of the youth asked,
[1169.20 --> 1170.50]  why does Jesus ask
[1170.50 --> 1171.80]  the disabled man
[1171.80 --> 1172.94]  if he wants to get healed?
[1173.70 --> 1174.06]  Remember,
[1174.26 --> 1174.82]  Jesus asked,
[1174.88 --> 1175.80]  the first thing he says,
[1176.36 --> 1177.18]  do you want to get well?
[1178.26 --> 1179.30]  The question is,
[1180.00 --> 1181.08]  the youth's question is,
[1181.26 --> 1182.46]  does the man really need
[1182.46 --> 1183.38]  to want healing
[1183.38 --> 1184.38]  in order to get healed?
[1185.82 --> 1187.10]  I think that's a very good
[1187.10 --> 1187.98]  insightful question,
[1188.10 --> 1189.14]  especially the second part.
[1191.04 --> 1191.94]  In response,
[1192.30 --> 1193.12]  I think it's important
[1193.12 --> 1194.30]  to notice the initial
[1194.30 --> 1196.44]  answer to Jesus' question
[1196.44 --> 1197.14]  by this man.
[1198.02 --> 1198.66]  Jesus says,
[1198.74 --> 1199.54]  do you want to get well?
[1200.54 --> 1200.86]  I mean,
[1200.96 --> 1201.78]  the obvious answer
[1201.78 --> 1202.64]  that we might think of
[1202.64 --> 1203.52]  was yes.
[1204.32 --> 1206.02]  But this man actually says,
[1206.52 --> 1207.62]  I have no one to help me.
[1207.98 --> 1209.12]  I've been stuck like this
[1209.12 --> 1210.04]  for 38 years.
[1210.04 --> 1213.12]  And that's his initial answer.
[1214.68 --> 1216.16]  And I also like the answer
[1216.16 --> 1217.06]  that one of the commentaries
[1217.06 --> 1217.50]  gave me.
[1218.48 --> 1219.50]  It seems that Jesus
[1219.50 --> 1220.96]  was initiating
[1220.96 --> 1222.26]  a conversation with the man
[1222.26 --> 1224.50]  to maybe establish
[1224.50 --> 1225.30]  a relationship
[1225.30 --> 1226.26]  with the man
[1226.26 --> 1227.14]  before healing him.
[1227.80 --> 1228.86]  This shows the very
[1228.86 --> 1230.28]  humanness of Jesus.
[1231.76 --> 1232.20]  Remember,
[1232.42 --> 1232.72]  Jesus,
[1232.94 --> 1233.40]  at the beginning
[1233.40 --> 1234.28]  of John 5,
[1234.44 --> 1235.14]  it says that Jesus
[1235.14 --> 1236.26]  goes up to Jerusalem
[1236.26 --> 1237.34]  for a festival.
[1238.56 --> 1239.28]  And if you know
[1239.28 --> 1240.60]  anything about the culture
[1240.60 --> 1240.90]  here,
[1241.26 --> 1242.08]  during a festival,
[1242.64 --> 1243.58]  it should be expected
[1243.58 --> 1244.50]  that Jesus goes up
[1244.50 --> 1245.00]  to Jerusalem
[1245.00 --> 1246.34]  to maybe go to the temple
[1246.34 --> 1247.06]  and worship.
[1247.76 --> 1248.78]  It is a festival.
[1250.38 --> 1252.46]  But he goes first,
[1252.84 --> 1253.78]  not to the temple,
[1254.50 --> 1255.84]  but he goes to the hospital
[1255.84 --> 1258.28]  where all the sick people
[1258.28 --> 1259.56]  or a lot of the sick people
[1259.56 --> 1260.04]  are gathered.
[1261.92 --> 1263.22]  And so to answer simply,
[1263.30 --> 1263.84]  I don't know if this
[1263.84 --> 1264.60]  answers your question,
[1264.66 --> 1265.54]  whoever asked this question,
[1265.54 --> 1268.44]  it is Jesus answering
[1268.44 --> 1270.68]  or Jesus asking this question
[1270.68 --> 1272.84]  and initiating this relationship
[1272.84 --> 1273.44]  with the man
[1273.44 --> 1275.00]  is showing us
[1275.00 --> 1275.96]  his compassion
[1275.96 --> 1277.22]  and his love
[1277.22 --> 1278.72]  and his loving character.
[1281.12 --> 1282.86]  And this love is shown
[1282.86 --> 1283.60]  to somebody
[1283.60 --> 1285.86]  who has no hope,
[1286.34 --> 1287.74]  absolutely no hope.
[1287.80 --> 1288.60]  And this is what I want
[1288.60 --> 1289.80]  to explain first as well.
[1290.58 --> 1292.06]  No hope of being healed.
[1292.06 --> 1294.66]  And to get a little more personal,
[1295.16 --> 1295.98]  that has been actually
[1295.98 --> 1296.96]  my own experience
[1296.96 --> 1297.82]  with eczema
[1297.82 --> 1299.00]  or eczema,
[1299.32 --> 1300.46]  however you pronounce it here.
[1301.66 --> 1302.96]  For my fellow Koreans,
[1303.22 --> 1304.34]  you might not be aware
[1304.34 --> 1305.38]  of this term eczema,
[1305.56 --> 1305.90]  eczema.
[1306.22 --> 1306.64]  In Korean,
[1306.72 --> 1307.64]  we just call it atopy.
[1308.26 --> 1309.94]  So I grew up with eczema
[1309.94 --> 1311.90]  ever since I was born.
[1312.50 --> 1313.70]  So this skin condition
[1313.70 --> 1314.38]  that I have
[1314.38 --> 1315.02]  is going on
[1315.02 --> 1316.48]  for 31, 32 years now.
[1316.66 --> 1317.48]  That's how old I am.
[1318.28 --> 1319.38]  I may have to wait
[1319.38 --> 1320.98]  maybe another six years
[1320.98 --> 1321.98]  so that I can maybe
[1321.98 --> 1323.32]  fully relate with this man
[1323.32 --> 1324.08]  because he said he
[1324.08 --> 1325.46]  had this condition
[1325.46 --> 1326.74]  for 38 years.
[1326.88 --> 1327.58]  I've only had it
[1327.58 --> 1328.86]  for 31, 2.
[1329.56 --> 1331.32]  But my journey
[1331.32 --> 1332.50]  through this sickness,
[1333.56 --> 1334.28]  this condition
[1334.28 --> 1335.24]  has not always been
[1335.24 --> 1336.18]  easy to deal with,
[1336.60 --> 1338.14]  especially in my puberty years.
[1339.08 --> 1340.02]  Now I've prayed,
[1340.68 --> 1341.72]  been prayed over,
[1342.40 --> 1342.96]  have been through
[1342.96 --> 1344.08]  spiritual experiences
[1344.08 --> 1344.84]  that may sound
[1344.84 --> 1345.84]  a little bit out there,
[1346.12 --> 1346.94]  especially in our
[1346.94 --> 1348.40]  CRC tradition maybe.
[1348.40 --> 1349.90]  And obviously,
[1350.10 --> 1350.62]  I've been through
[1350.62 --> 1351.00]  the ringer
[1351.00 --> 1352.04]  when it comes to medicine.
[1354.18 --> 1355.88]  Joseph even asked me recently,
[1356.48 --> 1357.64]  I told him,
[1357.78 --> 1358.80]  and he's at an age
[1358.80 --> 1359.50]  where he can understand
[1359.50 --> 1360.10]  a little more,
[1360.24 --> 1360.94]  and I told him,
[1361.28 --> 1363.54]  oh, Joseph looks at my face
[1363.54 --> 1363.90]  and goes,
[1364.36 --> 1365.76]  why is your face like that?
[1367.08 --> 1368.66]  What's with your skin?
[1369.26 --> 1370.80]  Why is it so red sometimes?
[1372.22 --> 1373.10]  And I told him,
[1373.18 --> 1374.48]  oh, it's a skin condition,
[1374.54 --> 1375.52]  it's not going to go away.
[1376.08 --> 1377.34]  I've had it since I was born.
[1377.96 --> 1378.44]  And he said,
[1378.54 --> 1380.88]  oh, how come it doesn't go away?
[1381.60 --> 1382.52]  Can't you get surgery
[1382.52 --> 1383.00]  or something?
[1385.38 --> 1386.38]  And it's ironic
[1386.38 --> 1387.84]  that Joseph asked me
[1387.84 --> 1388.56]  that question
[1388.56 --> 1390.12]  because the only time
[1390.12 --> 1391.12]  I experienced
[1391.12 --> 1392.64]  ever in my life,
[1392.82 --> 1393.82]  to my knowledge,
[1393.82 --> 1395.90]  a non-eczemic skin,
[1396.20 --> 1396.78]  like skin,
[1397.40 --> 1398.48]  was when Joseph
[1398.48 --> 1399.24]  was first born.
[1399.96 --> 1400.92]  After he was born,
[1401.54 --> 1403.10]  I had pure skin,
[1403.10 --> 1404.84]  and it lasted
[1404.84 --> 1406.46]  a whole two weeks.
[1408.56 --> 1408.92]  And then,
[1409.24 --> 1410.16]  during those two weeks,
[1410.34 --> 1410.70]  Moon even,
[1410.90 --> 1411.58]  Moon, my wife,
[1411.62 --> 1412.06]  even noticed.
[1412.34 --> 1412.84]  She's like,
[1413.66 --> 1414.68]  what's wrong with your skin?
[1415.60 --> 1416.96]  It's so clean.
[1417.46 --> 1418.34]  It's smooth.
[1418.98 --> 1419.18]  You know,
[1419.28 --> 1420.62]  because eczema,
[1420.78 --> 1421.24]  if you don't know,
[1421.32 --> 1422.32]  it's dryness.
[1422.48 --> 1423.60]  It's dry skin,
[1424.20 --> 1426.58]  and it's allergic reactions,
[1426.82 --> 1427.86]  sensitivity to
[1427.86 --> 1429.08]  many different things.
[1429.24 --> 1430.58]  And people still don't know
[1430.58 --> 1431.66]  the exact reason
[1431.66 --> 1432.78]  why people have eczema.
[1433.96 --> 1434.40]  And so,
[1434.50 --> 1435.92]  I can confidently tell you today
[1435.92 --> 1437.88]  that I'm not healed physically.
[1438.58 --> 1439.96]  And I have accepted the fact
[1439.96 --> 1440.78]  that I will probably go
[1440.78 --> 1441.54]  my whole lifetime
[1441.54 --> 1442.32]  with this condition.
[1442.96 --> 1444.54]  But the important part,
[1445.00 --> 1446.12]  the reason I'm sharing
[1446.12 --> 1446.76]  this story,
[1446.88 --> 1447.68]  my testimony,
[1448.48 --> 1449.54]  is to show you
[1449.54 --> 1450.24]  and tell you
[1450.24 --> 1451.02]  how God
[1451.02 --> 1452.86]  used my condition
[1452.86 --> 1454.06]  all throughout my life,
[1454.12 --> 1454.78]  even now,
[1455.04 --> 1456.80]  and that He will continue to
[1456.80 --> 1458.72]  bring me closer to Him.
[1458.72 --> 1461.08]  God's ways
[1461.08 --> 1462.60]  are so mysterious sometimes
[1462.60 --> 1463.80]  in how He can bring
[1463.80 --> 1465.08]  so much good for me,
[1465.68 --> 1467.18]  like my spiritual healing,
[1467.78 --> 1469.48]  through my physical illness.
[1471.64 --> 1472.44]  And so,
[1472.66 --> 1473.86]  I hope you can see,
[1473.94 --> 1474.90]  or maybe even relate
[1474.90 --> 1475.36]  a little bit
[1475.36 --> 1476.40]  to the hopelessness
[1476.40 --> 1478.92]  of this man's state
[1478.92 --> 1479.82]  that we looked at today.
[1480.06 --> 1481.48]  This paraplegic man
[1481.48 --> 1482.96]  who had been like this
[1482.96 --> 1483.94]  in his condition
[1483.94 --> 1485.14]  for 38 years,
[1485.34 --> 1486.30]  and he doesn't see
[1486.30 --> 1487.34]  any hope in the future
[1487.34 --> 1488.64]  of ever getting healed.
[1491.12 --> 1492.48]  Especially in this context
[1492.48 --> 1493.16]  that we look at,
[1493.22 --> 1494.34]  this is a full lifetime,
[1494.50 --> 1495.46]  38 years.
[1495.88 --> 1496.80]  Many people didn't even
[1496.80 --> 1497.54]  live that long.
[1499.18 --> 1500.42]  But my point, again,
[1500.50 --> 1502.08]  is not to just buy sympathy
[1502.08 --> 1502.96]  for this man,
[1503.12 --> 1504.24]  or to buy sympathy
[1504.24 --> 1505.12]  from you guys,
[1505.58 --> 1506.08]  for me,
[1506.28 --> 1507.30]  by sharing this story.
[1508.66 --> 1509.98]  What I actually want
[1509.98 --> 1510.70]  to expose
[1510.70 --> 1511.76]  from this story,
[1511.96 --> 1512.90]  and actually expose
[1512.90 --> 1514.14]  from my own experience,
[1514.48 --> 1515.28]  is the pattern
[1515.28 --> 1517.14]  of self-victimization,
[1517.34 --> 1519.00]  and a habit of blame
[1519.00 --> 1520.44]  with a sickness
[1520.44 --> 1521.26]  of this sort.
[1523.08 --> 1523.32]  And so,
[1523.44 --> 1524.60]  growing up with this condition,
[1524.72 --> 1525.66]  growing up with eczema,
[1525.76 --> 1526.52]  back to my story,
[1526.72 --> 1528.06]  I would blame doctors
[1528.06 --> 1529.18]  and the medicine
[1529.18 --> 1530.58]  that seemed to do me no good.
[1531.24 --> 1532.84]  I would also blame myself
[1532.84 --> 1533.42]  for thinking
[1533.42 --> 1534.88]  that I have this condition
[1534.88 --> 1536.26]  because I sinned so much,
[1536.52 --> 1537.98]  that I haven't repented enough,
[1538.48 --> 1541.40]  or that I didn't have enough faith
[1541.40 --> 1542.30]  and prayer
[1542.30 --> 1543.78]  to be fully healed.
[1543.78 --> 1546.90]  that eventually,
[1547.14 --> 1547.50]  obviously,
[1548.14 --> 1548.76]  naturally,
[1549.08 --> 1550.56]  led me to blame God.
[1552.16 --> 1552.90]  Why me?
[1553.58 --> 1555.60]  Why do I have to suffer so much?
[1556.08 --> 1557.18]  Especially growing up
[1557.18 --> 1558.18]  as a Korean immigrant
[1558.18 --> 1560.96]  that already has race issues,
[1561.54 --> 1565.38]  to be cursed in my mindset,
[1565.64 --> 1567.36]  to be cursed with this condition as well,
[1567.42 --> 1568.62]  another burden on top of me
[1568.62 --> 1569.30]  as I grow
[1569.30 --> 1570.88]  in my formative years
[1570.88 --> 1571.48]  here in Canada.
[1571.48 --> 1572.60]  Why me?
[1573.14 --> 1574.20]  All my other siblings
[1574.20 --> 1575.84]  have really great skin.
[1576.44 --> 1577.24]  Why just me?
[1577.72 --> 1578.60]  Why am I cursed?
[1579.50 --> 1579.94]  And that's,
[1580.06 --> 1582.04]  that's the habit
[1582.04 --> 1583.26]  of self-victimization
[1583.26 --> 1584.62]  and blame
[1584.62 --> 1585.84]  that is reflected
[1585.84 --> 1586.84]  in this man as well.
[1587.44 --> 1588.02]  Jesus asked,
[1588.16 --> 1589.04]  do you want to get well?
[1589.76 --> 1590.92]  And showing compassion
[1590.92 --> 1591.60]  to this man,
[1592.60 --> 1593.78]  I know you've been sick
[1593.78 --> 1594.68]  for your whole lifetime.
[1595.30 --> 1596.32]  I want to ask you,
[1596.40 --> 1597.38]  do you want to get well?
[1597.86 --> 1598.70]  And the man says,
[1598.70 --> 1600.98]  I've been stuck like this
[1600.98 --> 1601.84]  for 38 years.
[1602.00 --> 1602.82]  I want to get down
[1602.82 --> 1603.40]  to that pool
[1603.40 --> 1604.36]  where I believe
[1604.36 --> 1605.56]  there might be healing there,
[1605.66 --> 1606.72]  but I can't get there
[1606.72 --> 1607.62]  because all these other
[1607.62 --> 1608.64]  selfish sick people
[1608.64 --> 1609.72]  beat me to it.
[1610.86 --> 1612.34]  That's his initial response.
[1612.42 --> 1613.52]  That's his first answer
[1613.52 --> 1614.30]  to Jesus
[1614.30 --> 1615.92]  showing compassion for him.
[1617.88 --> 1619.34]  What is my response
[1619.34 --> 1620.50]  and how am I here today?
[1620.70 --> 1621.96]  I've already shared with you
[1621.96 --> 1623.88]  the mysterious ways of God
[1623.88 --> 1625.86]  and how he uses my illness
[1625.86 --> 1627.40]  to bring me closer to him.
[1628.70 --> 1631.14]  When Jesus confronts me,
[1631.52 --> 1632.88]  he confronted me
[1632.88 --> 1634.90]  and he continues to confront me
[1634.90 --> 1636.16]  with truth and grace,
[1636.88 --> 1638.66]  it ironically brings me
[1638.66 --> 1639.56]  closer to him.
[1641.20 --> 1643.62]  We have seen in our John series
[1643.62 --> 1645.04]  with Nicodemus
[1645.04 --> 1646.00]  and the Samaritan woman
[1646.00 --> 1647.08]  that we looked at last week
[1647.08 --> 1648.28]  and we will later see
[1648.28 --> 1650.84]  with Thomas the disciple,
[1651.58 --> 1652.60]  God's work displayed
[1652.60 --> 1653.46]  through their lives,
[1653.74 --> 1654.80]  their confrontation
[1654.80 --> 1656.04]  and response
[1656.04 --> 1657.20]  to truth and grace.
[1658.70 --> 1660.30]  But that doesn't mean
[1660.30 --> 1661.14]  that the response
[1661.14 --> 1662.22]  is always the same.
[1663.28 --> 1664.38]  We don't know for sure
[1664.38 --> 1665.64]  what happened to Nicodemus
[1665.64 --> 1667.52]  after his initial confrontation
[1667.52 --> 1668.14]  with Jesus,
[1668.70 --> 1670.20]  although I do agree with Dave
[1670.20 --> 1670.86]  that later on
[1670.86 --> 1672.38]  he does seem to respond in faith.
[1673.64 --> 1675.02]  And with our man today,
[1675.14 --> 1676.42]  with our paraplegic man
[1676.42 --> 1677.18]  who was healed today
[1677.18 --> 1677.92]  in our story,
[1678.92 --> 1680.50]  after being healed physically,
[1681.08 --> 1682.30]  Jesus confronts him again
[1682.30 --> 1682.96]  later on
[1682.96 --> 1684.34]  with grace and truth.
[1684.34 --> 1687.02]  In light of grace,
[1687.20 --> 1688.52]  Jesus says to him,
[1688.92 --> 1690.74]  see that you are well again.
[1691.40 --> 1692.64]  See you are healed.
[1694.14 --> 1695.72]  Jesus is confronting him
[1695.72 --> 1696.50]  with grace saying,
[1696.90 --> 1697.72]  you are healed.
[1697.98 --> 1699.02]  I have healed you.
[1700.00 --> 1700.94]  Live in gratitude.
[1702.12 --> 1703.50]  Remember that you have been sick
[1703.50 --> 1704.38]  your whole life
[1704.38 --> 1705.76]  but now you are healed.
[1707.34 --> 1709.02]  Live in that gratitude
[1709.02 --> 1709.84]  and humility.
[1709.84 --> 1713.12]  And he also confronts him
[1713.12 --> 1713.98]  in truth.
[1714.34 --> 1715.24]  Jesus says to him,
[1716.10 --> 1717.62]  do not sin no longer
[1717.62 --> 1720.08]  or else something worse
[1720.08 --> 1720.96]  might happen to you.
[1724.26 --> 1725.12]  And so,
[1725.44 --> 1727.56]  what was this paraplegic man's
[1727.56 --> 1728.66]  response to his confrontation
[1728.66 --> 1729.30]  to Jesus?
[1730.58 --> 1731.66]  In our story,
[1731.82 --> 1733.12]  he ends up reporting Jesus
[1733.12 --> 1733.86]  to the Jews,
[1734.36 --> 1735.70]  which John says
[1735.70 --> 1737.10]  was the start of the persecution
[1737.10 --> 1738.70]  of the Jews against Jesus.
[1738.70 --> 1740.22]  And that's the last time
[1740.22 --> 1741.06]  we hear of this man
[1741.06 --> 1741.84]  in John's Gospel.
[1742.80 --> 1743.12]  And so,
[1743.18 --> 1743.54]  we don't know
[1743.54 --> 1744.34]  what happened to him.
[1745.44 --> 1746.82]  But what I want to emphasize
[1746.82 --> 1748.36]  is that the miraculous signs
[1748.36 --> 1749.36]  that Jesus performs,
[1749.80 --> 1751.08]  the healings that we hear,
[1751.42 --> 1753.18]  the different miraculous works
[1753.18 --> 1754.18]  that Jesus works
[1754.18 --> 1756.68]  during his lifetime here,
[1756.76 --> 1757.42]  that he worked
[1757.42 --> 1758.46]  during his lifetime
[1758.46 --> 1759.50]  that we see in the Bible,
[1759.88 --> 1760.86]  are not just
[1760.86 --> 1762.34]  for acts of healing
[1762.34 --> 1763.24]  for healing's sake.
[1764.84 --> 1765.84]  This healing
[1765.84 --> 1767.18]  in John chapter 5,
[1767.18 --> 1769.00]  along with other miraculous signs,
[1769.48 --> 1771.14]  points the full restoration
[1771.14 --> 1772.16]  of God's kingdom
[1772.16 --> 1773.78]  and his good creation.
[1775.28 --> 1776.62]  The miracle that we read
[1776.62 --> 1777.20]  in John 5
[1777.20 --> 1778.28]  is usually compared
[1778.28 --> 1779.24]  to the healing
[1779.24 --> 1780.12]  of the blind man
[1780.12 --> 1781.46]  in John chapter 9.
[1781.82 --> 1783.06]  And Jesus says clearly
[1783.06 --> 1784.50]  when it comes
[1784.50 --> 1785.26]  to that healing.
[1786.04 --> 1787.62]  We read in John 9,
[1787.70 --> 1788.18]  verse 3,
[1788.18 --> 1790.50]  Neither this man
[1790.50 --> 1792.14]  nor his parents sinned,
[1792.14 --> 1793.28]  but this healing
[1793.28 --> 1794.98]  happened so that
[1794.98 --> 1795.90]  the works of God
[1795.90 --> 1797.30]  might be displayed in him.
[1800.08 --> 1801.54]  The works of God
[1801.54 --> 1803.04]  are the inbreaking
[1803.04 --> 1803.70]  of his kingdom
[1803.70 --> 1804.58]  here and now
[1804.58 --> 1805.54]  through the work
[1805.54 --> 1806.30]  of Jesus Christ,
[1806.92 --> 1808.04]  which is the same
[1808.04 --> 1808.64]  as the work
[1808.64 --> 1809.18]  of the Father.
[1809.48 --> 1810.24]  It is the unity
[1810.24 --> 1811.42]  between Father God
[1811.42 --> 1812.90]  and the Son Jesus Christ
[1812.90 --> 1814.94]  who brings his kingdom
[1814.94 --> 1816.48]  here and now for us.
[1816.48 --> 1818.28]  But,
[1818.48 --> 1819.46]  we are familiar
[1819.46 --> 1820.12]  with the phrase,
[1820.24 --> 1821.16]  now but not yet.
[1821.94 --> 1823.44]  It is also the not yet
[1823.44 --> 1825.08]  where we await
[1825.08 --> 1825.76]  in hope
[1825.76 --> 1827.76]  of the full restoration
[1827.76 --> 1828.58]  of God's kingdom.
[1830.60 --> 1831.54]  This is actually
[1831.54 --> 1832.68]  part of the answer
[1832.68 --> 1833.54]  to another insightful
[1833.54 --> 1834.40]  question that we had
[1834.40 --> 1835.70]  from another youth
[1835.70 --> 1836.20]  this week.
[1837.06 --> 1837.84]  Somebody asked,
[1838.54 --> 1839.28]  Why don't we see
[1839.28 --> 1839.92]  God healing
[1839.92 --> 1841.10]  more people today?
[1842.34 --> 1842.82]  Now,
[1842.86 --> 1843.56]  I don't know about you,
[1843.66 --> 1844.46]  but this is a question
[1844.46 --> 1845.42]  that I've had myself
[1845.42 --> 1846.00]  growing up.
[1846.56 --> 1847.50]  Why don't we see
[1847.50 --> 1848.74]  more miracles happen today?
[1849.24 --> 1849.96]  Why don't we see
[1849.96 --> 1851.12]  more healings?
[1851.52 --> 1852.14]  All of a sudden,
[1852.26 --> 1853.14]  a paralyzed man
[1853.14 --> 1854.00]  gets up and walks.
[1859.88 --> 1860.76]  Part of the reason
[1860.76 --> 1861.88]  I think this question
[1861.88 --> 1862.62]  is asked,
[1863.52 --> 1864.44]  and this is my opinion,
[1864.56 --> 1865.34]  is because of how
[1865.34 --> 1867.08]  modernity has created
[1867.08 --> 1868.46]  a false dichotomy
[1868.46 --> 1869.72]  between science and faith.
[1869.80 --> 1871.02]  And this is my take on it.
[1871.62 --> 1872.48]  And so let me explain.
[1872.48 --> 1873.18]  Now,
[1873.18 --> 1875.18]  I don't think a lot of us
[1875.18 --> 1876.60]  don't even get to see
[1876.60 --> 1878.26]  and hear God's work,
[1878.46 --> 1879.92]  God working through doctors
[1879.92 --> 1881.66]  and hospitals and clinics
[1881.66 --> 1883.70]  and all the minor healings
[1883.70 --> 1884.90]  that may go on every day.
[1886.80 --> 1887.26]  Yes,
[1887.34 --> 1888.10]  there is suffering,
[1888.24 --> 1889.56]  and sometimes it seems like
[1889.56 --> 1891.12]  suffering overwhelms
[1891.12 --> 1891.90]  the amount of healing
[1891.90 --> 1892.86]  that we may witness.
[1894.26 --> 1896.10]  But when we pray for healing,
[1896.60 --> 1898.14]  we get to think about
[1898.14 --> 1899.18]  and be thankful
[1899.18 --> 1900.12]  for all the healing
[1900.12 --> 1901.38]  that actually does happen.
[1902.62 --> 1903.94]  So practically speaking,
[1904.04 --> 1904.82]  when we pray,
[1905.36 --> 1906.18]  in our church,
[1906.82 --> 1908.04]  we pray for those
[1908.04 --> 1908.66]  who are sick.
[1909.68 --> 1911.90]  We at least open ourselves up
[1911.90 --> 1913.74]  to witness God working.
[1915.44 --> 1916.90]  But if we don't pray,
[1917.28 --> 1918.88]  whether one is healed or not,
[1919.86 --> 1920.98]  we do not see,
[1921.44 --> 1922.64]  or frankly speaking,
[1922.84 --> 1923.72]  we don't even care
[1923.72 --> 1924.30]  about the people
[1924.30 --> 1924.88]  who are sick.
[1925.64 --> 1926.52]  We don't care
[1926.52 --> 1927.64]  if there is healing or not.
[1927.64 --> 1930.22]  If we are not opening ourselves
[1930.22 --> 1931.62]  in prayer to God
[1931.62 --> 1932.38]  to witness.
[1933.98 --> 1935.22]  And so the more we pray,
[1935.52 --> 1936.66]  the more we open ourselves
[1936.66 --> 1937.96]  to witness God's work,
[1938.24 --> 1939.46]  which confronts us
[1939.46 --> 1940.62]  with grace and truth.
[1942.50 --> 1943.94]  That is the point of healing.
[1944.68 --> 1945.42]  When we pray,
[1945.74 --> 1947.64]  and when we open ourselves up,
[1947.96 --> 1948.94]  we are confronted
[1948.94 --> 1950.66]  by those miraculous signs,
[1951.26 --> 1952.72]  and it confronts us
[1952.72 --> 1953.72]  with truth and grace.
[1953.72 --> 1956.24]  And you see,
[1956.56 --> 1957.74]  the gospel that we read
[1957.74 --> 1958.22]  and witness
[1958.22 --> 1959.70]  confronts us as well.
[1960.64 --> 1962.12]  It does not just allow us
[1962.12 --> 1963.26]  to sit on the fence
[1963.26 --> 1964.52]  with our own faith.
[1965.28 --> 1966.20]  And the gospel of John,
[1966.26 --> 1966.58]  I think,
[1966.72 --> 1968.90]  does especially pinpoints
[1968.90 --> 1970.04]  this ministry of the gospel
[1970.04 --> 1970.78]  that we have,
[1971.02 --> 1972.60]  that we read from John 20.
[1973.68 --> 1975.16]  This is a recurring theme.
[1975.46 --> 1976.48]  This is the main point
[1976.48 --> 1977.44]  of John's gospel
[1977.44 --> 1978.54]  that we are looking at
[1978.54 --> 1979.86]  in this sermon series.
[1979.86 --> 1983.14]  John 20, verse 31.
[1986.14 --> 1986.96]  But these,
[1987.62 --> 1988.66]  so the works of God
[1988.66 --> 1989.20]  through Jesus,
[1989.38 --> 1989.84]  are written
[1989.84 --> 1991.80]  so that you may believe
[1991.80 --> 1993.68]  that Jesus is the Messiah,
[1994.22 --> 1995.14]  the Son of God,
[1995.78 --> 1996.86]  and that by believing
[1996.86 --> 1998.10]  you may have life
[1998.10 --> 1998.82]  in His name.
[2000.44 --> 2002.16]  In Acts, Peter says,
[2002.78 --> 2003.90]  and everyone who calls
[2003.90 --> 2005.00]  on the name of the Lord
[2005.00 --> 2005.96]  will be saved.
[2007.44 --> 2009.16]  Paul also echoes this.
[2009.16 --> 2010.82]  Believe in the Lord Jesus
[2010.82 --> 2012.50]  and you will be saved,
[2013.04 --> 2014.26]  you and your household.
[2017.22 --> 2017.70]  And so,
[2017.88 --> 2018.66]  I do not think
[2018.66 --> 2019.60]  it is the purpose
[2019.60 --> 2020.78]  of us as the readers
[2020.78 --> 2022.18]  to read too much
[2022.18 --> 2022.82]  into the healing
[2022.82 --> 2024.38]  of this one paraplegic man.
[2025.70 --> 2026.94]  Whether he was healed
[2026.94 --> 2027.68]  both physically
[2027.68 --> 2028.48]  and spiritually,
[2028.84 --> 2029.56]  the text actually
[2029.56 --> 2030.36]  doesn't even say.
[2031.74 --> 2033.60]  The purpose of this story
[2033.60 --> 2034.90]  is to further reveal
[2034.90 --> 2036.76]  Jesus' identity
[2036.76 --> 2038.16]  as the Son of God,
[2038.16 --> 2039.52]  the Savior of the world
[2039.52 --> 2040.48]  who takes away
[2040.48 --> 2041.24]  the sin.
[2042.24 --> 2043.20]  And this message
[2043.20 --> 2044.64]  is directed to us.
[2046.62 --> 2047.98]  And that's another aspect
[2047.98 --> 2048.70]  that I can relate
[2048.70 --> 2049.16]  with Carrie.
[2050.28 --> 2051.86]  When was I converted?
[2052.20 --> 2052.80]  I would say,
[2052.90 --> 2054.24]  growing up as a pastor's kid,
[2055.04 --> 2055.62]  I would say
[2055.62 --> 2056.70]  when I was confronted
[2056.70 --> 2058.56]  with the real truth
[2058.56 --> 2059.36]  that I am a sinner.
[2059.36 --> 2065.38]  to believe in Jesus
[2065.38 --> 2066.62]  is not simply
[2066.62 --> 2067.42]  a passive
[2067.42 --> 2068.84]  and intellectual knowledge,
[2069.36 --> 2070.10]  which sometimes
[2070.10 --> 2071.60]  our modern world
[2071.60 --> 2073.84]  emphasizes too much.
[2075.28 --> 2076.12]  Dave emphasized
[2076.12 --> 2077.54]  in his previous sermon
[2077.54 --> 2078.56]  that when we are
[2078.56 --> 2079.54]  called to believe
[2079.54 --> 2080.90]  and when John calls us
[2080.90 --> 2081.42]  to believe
[2081.42 --> 2082.38]  through the gospel,
[2082.98 --> 2084.28]  it means we are
[2084.28 --> 2086.50]  called to be believers.
[2086.50 --> 2087.70]  It is our identity.
[2088.34 --> 2089.38]  It is our whole life.
[2089.46 --> 2089.98]  It is not,
[2090.60 --> 2091.44]  okay, here's God,
[2091.54 --> 2092.06]  here's Jesus,
[2092.24 --> 2092.70]  believe in.
[2093.60 --> 2094.16]  Okay, get that
[2094.16 --> 2094.72]  through your head.
[2095.36 --> 2096.46]  Now you understand it.
[2096.68 --> 2097.48]  Put it on a test
[2097.48 --> 2097.88]  or something.
[2097.98 --> 2098.42]  You pass,
[2098.50 --> 2099.20]  now you're a Christian.
[2099.76 --> 2100.02]  No.
[2100.64 --> 2101.92]  It is to be
[2101.92 --> 2104.70]  fully oriented,
[2105.40 --> 2106.56]  to be an active,
[2107.56 --> 2108.50]  active,
[2110.50 --> 2111.28]  active,
[2111.84 --> 2112.18]  I don't,
[2112.40 --> 2113.26]  I can't think of
[2113.26 --> 2113.86]  the word right now.
[2113.86 --> 2115.04]  to be an active,
[2115.56 --> 2117.26]  to have an active life,
[2117.56 --> 2118.56]  our whole life
[2118.56 --> 2120.18]  oriented to God.
[2122.92 --> 2124.22]  This is the actual,
[2125.02 --> 2126.86]  this leads up
[2126.86 --> 2127.60]  to the actual
[2127.60 --> 2128.58]  second healing
[2128.58 --> 2129.30]  that happens
[2129.30 --> 2130.20]  after the healing
[2130.20 --> 2131.48]  of this paraplegic man,
[2131.74 --> 2132.56]  if we can call it
[2132.56 --> 2133.26]  a second healing.
[2134.48 --> 2135.78]  This is the crucial part
[2135.78 --> 2136.48]  of the text today.
[2137.40 --> 2139.02]  After Jesus heals the man,
[2139.12 --> 2140.42]  he tells him to get up.
[2141.82 --> 2142.64]  Jesus could have ended
[2142.64 --> 2143.38]  his healing there,
[2143.38 --> 2144.32]  but he tells the man
[2144.32 --> 2145.06]  specifically,
[2145.56 --> 2146.42]  pick up your mat
[2146.42 --> 2147.24]  and walk.
[2148.50 --> 2149.98]  The day on which
[2149.98 --> 2150.80]  this took place
[2150.80 --> 2152.44]  was the Sabbath.
[2154.10 --> 2154.60]  And you see,
[2154.76 --> 2155.60]  based on Scripture,
[2155.86 --> 2156.96]  and so what we call
[2156.96 --> 2157.80]  the Old Testament,
[2158.30 --> 2159.26]  the Jews forbade
[2159.26 --> 2159.90]  carrying things
[2159.90 --> 2160.66]  from one domain
[2160.66 --> 2161.20]  to another
[2161.20 --> 2162.34]  and specifically,
[2162.84 --> 2163.96]  you were prohibited
[2163.96 --> 2166.88]  to carry empty beds
[2166.88 --> 2167.54]  that they called
[2167.54 --> 2169.12]  on the Sabbath.
[2169.12 --> 2171.82]  a bed is a place
[2171.82 --> 2172.86]  where you rest on.
[2173.74 --> 2174.36]  And the Sabbath
[2174.36 --> 2175.70]  is a day where you rest.
[2176.28 --> 2177.24]  And so if you pick up
[2177.24 --> 2178.38]  the place that you're
[2178.38 --> 2179.28]  supposed to rest on
[2179.28 --> 2180.18]  and walk around,
[2180.52 --> 2181.78]  that means you are
[2181.78 --> 2183.60]  explicitly defying
[2183.60 --> 2184.56]  the rule of the Sabbath.
[2186.16 --> 2187.10]  And so when Jesus
[2187.10 --> 2187.92]  says to the man,
[2188.18 --> 2188.94]  pick up your mat
[2188.94 --> 2189.50]  and walk,
[2189.72 --> 2190.68]  pick up the place
[2190.68 --> 2191.20]  where you're supposed
[2191.20 --> 2192.62]  to rest and walk
[2192.62 --> 2194.62]  to show that you are healed,
[2194.92 --> 2196.20]  that you are fully healed,
[2196.20 --> 2198.08]  what is he trying to do?
[2198.24 --> 2199.00]  What is Jesus
[2199.00 --> 2200.08]  trying to do here?
[2201.48 --> 2202.52]  Is he purposely
[2202.52 --> 2203.68]  being controversial
[2203.68 --> 2205.08]  by explicitly
[2205.08 --> 2206.10]  and purposefully
[2206.10 --> 2207.62]  breaking a fundamental
[2207.62 --> 2208.24]  Sabbath rule?
[2209.22 --> 2210.26]  Is that what Jesus
[2210.26 --> 2210.92]  is getting at?
[2210.98 --> 2212.00]  Is that his main point,
[2212.18 --> 2213.26]  just to break the rule
[2213.26 --> 2214.58]  for breaking rule's sake?
[2217.00 --> 2217.48]  Obviously,
[2217.68 --> 2219.04]  that's not the main purpose.
[2219.52 --> 2219.74]  I mean,
[2219.82 --> 2221.24]  Jesus was a fiery guy
[2221.24 --> 2223.10]  overthrowing tables
[2223.10 --> 2223.66]  at the temple.
[2224.26 --> 2225.38]  But his passion
[2225.38 --> 2227.04]  always has reason.
[2227.96 --> 2228.80]  He doesn't just
[2228.80 --> 2229.56]  break the rules
[2229.56 --> 2230.78]  so that he can be
[2230.78 --> 2231.78]  one of the example
[2231.78 --> 2233.00]  rebels for us today.
[2233.50 --> 2234.48]  Oh, let's all be rebels
[2234.48 --> 2234.96]  like Jesus.
[2236.56 --> 2237.36]  The purpose
[2237.36 --> 2239.14]  of Jesus' ministry
[2239.14 --> 2241.00]  and his seemingly
[2241.00 --> 2241.74]  explicit
[2241.74 --> 2243.28]  and maybe disrespectful
[2243.28 --> 2244.78]  breaking of the law
[2244.78 --> 2246.24]  is for the purpose
[2246.24 --> 2247.34]  of God's glory.
[2248.74 --> 2250.40]  What is God's glory here?
[2251.48 --> 2252.32]  Jesus was simply
[2252.32 --> 2253.56]  doing God's work
[2253.56 --> 2254.28]  of restoration,
[2254.28 --> 2256.38]  healing a sick man
[2256.38 --> 2256.98]  who has been sick
[2256.98 --> 2258.08]  for 38 years,
[2258.74 --> 2260.02]  trying to show us
[2260.02 --> 2260.92]  and confront us
[2260.92 --> 2261.96]  with truth and grace,
[2262.36 --> 2262.96]  showing us
[2262.96 --> 2264.14]  this is the kingdom
[2264.14 --> 2264.78]  of God.
[2266.90 --> 2267.96]  God does not
[2267.96 --> 2268.54]  take a Sabbath
[2268.54 --> 2270.32]  in that he continues
[2270.32 --> 2271.10]  to uphold
[2271.10 --> 2272.38]  all of creation.
[2274.62 --> 2275.76]  Births and deaths
[2275.76 --> 2277.14]  still happen on Sabbath.
[2277.92 --> 2278.78]  It still happens
[2278.78 --> 2279.66]  every single day.
[2279.66 --> 2282.04]  The Jews acknowledge
[2282.04 --> 2282.46]  that.
[2283.16 --> 2284.30]  In a life and death
[2284.30 --> 2285.24]  situation, actually,
[2285.32 --> 2286.48]  the Jews also acknowledge
[2286.48 --> 2288.12]  that there is need
[2288.12 --> 2288.70]  for healing
[2288.70 --> 2289.98]  when it comes to life
[2289.98 --> 2290.34]  and death,
[2290.46 --> 2291.58]  even if it's on a Sabbath.
[2293.50 --> 2294.48]  But then Jesus
[2294.48 --> 2295.74]  takes that and says,
[2296.26 --> 2297.44]  in verse 17 and 19,
[2297.98 --> 2299.24]  my father is always
[2299.24 --> 2299.82]  at work
[2299.82 --> 2301.28]  to this very day
[2301.28 --> 2302.08]  on a Sabbath
[2302.08 --> 2303.36]  and I too
[2303.36 --> 2303.96]  am working.
[2303.96 --> 2306.38]  And, he says,
[2306.84 --> 2307.56]  that the son
[2307.56 --> 2308.36]  can do nothing
[2308.36 --> 2309.18]  by himself.
[2309.56 --> 2310.38]  He can only do
[2310.38 --> 2311.04]  what he sees
[2311.04 --> 2312.36]  his father doing
[2312.36 --> 2313.70]  because whatever
[2313.70 --> 2314.58]  the father does,
[2314.76 --> 2316.34]  the son also does.
[2318.06 --> 2319.30]  God doesn't take
[2319.30 --> 2319.68]  a Sabbath.
[2320.80 --> 2321.74]  I don't either.
[2322.72 --> 2323.60]  And so you can see
[2323.60 --> 2325.58]  and try to picture yourself
[2325.58 --> 2327.56]  in the Jewish people's shoes.
[2328.26 --> 2328.98]  This man
[2328.98 --> 2329.88]  is saying
[2329.88 --> 2331.12]  he is God.
[2332.00 --> 2332.92]  He is equating
[2332.92 --> 2333.80]  himself to God
[2333.80 --> 2334.28]  and saying,
[2334.74 --> 2335.34]  because God
[2335.34 --> 2335.82]  doesn't rest
[2335.82 --> 2336.34]  on the Sabbath,
[2336.80 --> 2337.70]  Jesus also heals
[2337.70 --> 2338.22]  on the Sabbath.
[2340.38 --> 2341.24]  Jesus here
[2341.24 --> 2341.86]  is revealing
[2341.86 --> 2342.66]  his identity.
[2343.22 --> 2344.36]  He is God.
[2344.64 --> 2345.32]  In the beginning
[2345.32 --> 2346.68]  was the Logos,
[2347.24 --> 2347.58]  Jesus.
[2348.18 --> 2349.54]  He was with God
[2349.54 --> 2351.30]  and he was God.
[2353.50 --> 2355.14]  When the paraplegic
[2355.14 --> 2355.92]  man was healed,
[2356.90 --> 2357.74]  the first thing
[2357.74 --> 2358.44]  that the Jews
[2358.44 --> 2359.52]  pointed out was,
[2360.02 --> 2360.20]  hey,
[2360.20 --> 2361.94]  it's the Sabbath.
[2362.44 --> 2363.62]  The law forbids you
[2363.62 --> 2364.52]  to work on the Sabbath.
[2364.92 --> 2365.32]  Why are you
[2365.32 --> 2366.02]  carrying your mat?
[2367.60 --> 2368.16]  And that's what
[2368.16 --> 2369.58]  every 38,
[2370.04 --> 2371.94]  that's what every man
[2371.94 --> 2373.34]  who was sick
[2373.34 --> 2374.28]  for 38 years
[2374.28 --> 2374.96]  wants to hear.
[2376.54 --> 2377.54]  Being paralyzed
[2377.54 --> 2378.74]  for 38 years,
[2379.20 --> 2380.84]  living in a state
[2380.84 --> 2381.80]  of hopelessness,
[2382.34 --> 2383.72]  being finally healed
[2383.72 --> 2384.64]  when his life
[2384.64 --> 2386.20]  is flipped upside down,
[2386.50 --> 2387.22]  his whole life
[2387.22 --> 2387.96]  is transformed,
[2388.34 --> 2389.30]  and then the first thing
[2389.30 --> 2390.08]  that Jewish people
[2390.08 --> 2390.82]  says to him is,
[2391.60 --> 2392.56]  why are you walking?
[2393.88 --> 2394.56]  What's wrong
[2394.56 --> 2395.22]  with your skin?
[2396.26 --> 2396.44]  Right?
[2396.88 --> 2398.24]  After being healed,
[2398.32 --> 2399.16]  after 30 years
[2399.16 --> 2399.74]  of my life,
[2400.20 --> 2401.26]  when Joseph was born,
[2401.46 --> 2402.68]  my skin is all fresh,
[2403.14 --> 2403.76]  and the first thing
[2403.76 --> 2404.14]  I hear,
[2405.14 --> 2406.36]  why is your skin
[2406.36 --> 2406.86]  so clean?
[2408.30 --> 2409.38]  Why are you working
[2409.38 --> 2409.98]  on the Sabbath?
[2411.64 --> 2412.82]  Why are you taking up
[2412.82 --> 2413.14]  your mat
[2413.14 --> 2413.58]  and walking
[2413.58 --> 2414.16]  on the Sabbath?
[2414.16 --> 2418.88]  And so Jesus heals
[2418.88 --> 2419.48]  on the Sabbath,
[2419.78 --> 2420.68]  revealing his true
[2420.68 --> 2422.62]  identity to his own people,
[2422.80 --> 2424.44]  which leads to persecution
[2424.44 --> 2425.10]  all the way
[2425.10 --> 2425.76]  to the cross.
[2428.14 --> 2429.36]  What Jesus is trying
[2429.36 --> 2430.20]  to show us,
[2431.58 --> 2432.62]  so to step out
[2432.62 --> 2433.16]  of this story
[2433.16 --> 2434.86]  and stepping into
[2434.86 --> 2436.04]  our story here and now,
[2437.04 --> 2438.52]  what is Jesus
[2438.52 --> 2439.82]  trying to show to us?
[2440.90 --> 2441.98]  Revealing his identity
[2441.98 --> 2442.96]  for what purpose?
[2445.00 --> 2446.36]  He's trying to show
[2446.36 --> 2447.30]  that religion
[2447.30 --> 2448.68]  is empty
[2448.68 --> 2450.82]  and that only God
[2450.82 --> 2451.42]  can heal.
[2454.30 --> 2455.84]  And this is the gospel.
[2456.10 --> 2457.10]  This is the good news.
[2458.60 --> 2459.76]  My favorite book,
[2459.84 --> 2460.30]  Ephesians,
[2460.46 --> 2462.00]  in Ephesians 2 specifically,
[2462.26 --> 2463.64]  it says that we are justified
[2463.64 --> 2465.10]  and we are saved
[2465.10 --> 2466.56]  only by grace.
[2467.78 --> 2469.78]  Our salvation from sin,
[2469.78 --> 2470.72]  the real,
[2470.92 --> 2471.90]  very real thing
[2471.90 --> 2472.42]  of sin
[2472.42 --> 2474.54]  from our own
[2474.54 --> 2475.82]  destructive autonomy
[2475.82 --> 2477.04]  or self-rule
[2477.04 --> 2478.30]  is by
[2478.30 --> 2479.46]  and only by
[2479.46 --> 2480.50]  God's grace alone.
[2481.38 --> 2483.20]  That's totally on God.
[2483.98 --> 2484.84]  But Ephesians,
[2485.00 --> 2485.80]  the verse in Ephesians
[2485.80 --> 2486.56]  doesn't end there.
[2486.66 --> 2487.04]  It says,
[2487.22 --> 2488.00]  you are saved
[2488.00 --> 2489.04]  by grace,
[2489.12 --> 2490.28]  it is the gift of God,
[2491.06 --> 2492.94]  through faith.
[2494.92 --> 2496.06]  Through faith.
[2497.20 --> 2498.56]  The faith that is given
[2498.56 --> 2499.10]  to us,
[2499.42 --> 2500.66]  it is our active
[2500.66 --> 2501.70]  orientation
[2501.70 --> 2503.54]  of our whole lives
[2503.54 --> 2505.06]  for God,
[2505.24 --> 2506.06]  made possible
[2506.06 --> 2506.72]  because God
[2506.72 --> 2507.74]  first loved us.
[2510.54 --> 2511.68]  And so I would like
[2511.68 --> 2512.18]  to finish
[2512.18 --> 2512.78]  and conclude
[2512.78 --> 2515.88]  this morning
[2515.88 --> 2517.06]  with my own
[2517.06 --> 2517.70]  little testimony
[2517.70 --> 2518.44]  that I weaved
[2518.44 --> 2519.12]  into this sermon.
[2520.28 --> 2521.26]  Now if Dave were
[2521.26 --> 2521.86]  to do the
[2521.86 --> 2522.74]  I believe interview
[2522.74 --> 2524.26]  with me
[2524.26 --> 2524.82]  and he asked
[2524.82 --> 2525.28]  the question,
[2525.62 --> 2526.38]  when or how did
[2526.38 --> 2527.08]  you come to believe?
[2528.28 --> 2529.28]  My answer would be
[2529.28 --> 2529.80]  kind of similar
[2529.80 --> 2530.40]  to Carrie's.
[2530.60 --> 2531.26]  I would say,
[2531.86 --> 2532.46]  I think it was
[2532.46 --> 2533.40]  the step two
[2533.40 --> 2534.68]  of Carrie's testimony,
[2535.32 --> 2536.16]  when my religion
[2536.16 --> 2537.06]  was stripped away.
[2538.58 --> 2539.26]  That would be
[2539.26 --> 2539.88]  my answer.
[2541.04 --> 2541.34]  John,
[2542.08 --> 2542.78]  when did you
[2542.78 --> 2543.34]  or how did you
[2543.34 --> 2544.06]  come to believe?
[2544.78 --> 2545.46]  And how did you
[2545.46 --> 2546.52]  convert to Christianity?
[2547.64 --> 2548.90]  I was a Christian
[2548.90 --> 2549.84]  my whole life.
[2551.24 --> 2552.02]  But I would say
[2552.02 --> 2553.34]  I became a true Christian
[2553.34 --> 2554.60]  when my religion
[2554.60 --> 2555.40]  was stripped away.
[2556.40 --> 2557.44]  When I started
[2557.44 --> 2558.86]  to stop,
[2559.08 --> 2559.94]  when I started
[2559.94 --> 2560.54]  to stop
[2560.54 --> 2561.84]  equating my
[2561.84 --> 2562.64]  Christian religious
[2562.64 --> 2563.32]  actions
[2563.32 --> 2564.70]  to the situations
[2564.70 --> 2565.44]  of my life,
[2565.92 --> 2566.88]  to my sickness,
[2567.30 --> 2568.04]  to my good
[2568.04 --> 2569.16]  and bad experiences
[2569.16 --> 2569.72]  growing up
[2569.72 --> 2570.28]  as an immigrant
[2570.28 --> 2571.30]  and all the rest.
[2572.02 --> 2572.80]  When I truly
[2572.80 --> 2573.38]  believed
[2573.38 --> 2574.20]  and trusted
[2574.20 --> 2575.32]  that in all things
[2575.32 --> 2576.24]  God works
[2576.24 --> 2576.74]  for the good
[2576.74 --> 2577.16]  of those
[2577.16 --> 2577.78]  who love Him.
[2580.18 --> 2580.98]  These words
[2580.98 --> 2581.54]  by Jesus,
[2582.26 --> 2582.98]  we didn't read it,
[2582.98 --> 2583.98]  but in chapter 5,
[2584.08 --> 2584.92]  Jesus says this
[2584.92 --> 2586.12]  to the Jews.
[2586.42 --> 2587.08]  And this actually
[2587.08 --> 2587.80]  speaks right
[2587.80 --> 2589.12]  into my life.
[2590.70 --> 2591.82]  You study
[2591.82 --> 2592.50]  the scriptures
[2592.50 --> 2593.28]  diligently
[2593.28 --> 2594.86]  because you think
[2594.86 --> 2595.94]  that in them
[2595.94 --> 2597.16]  you have eternal life.
[2598.58 --> 2599.02]  You see,
[2599.16 --> 2599.96]  these are the
[2599.96 --> 2600.72]  very scriptures
[2600.72 --> 2601.96]  that testify
[2601.96 --> 2603.26]  about me.
[2603.84 --> 2604.36]  And this is
[2604.36 --> 2605.08]  Jesus talking
[2605.08 --> 2605.56]  to us.
[2606.96 --> 2608.18]  I studied
[2608.18 --> 2609.30]  scripture diligently.
[2609.78 --> 2610.60]  I grew up
[2610.60 --> 2611.60]  as the role model
[2611.60 --> 2612.38]  pastor's kid.
[2612.98 --> 2614.26]  I don't know
[2614.26 --> 2615.08]  how my siblings
[2615.08 --> 2615.84]  will feel about this,
[2615.88 --> 2616.40]  but my siblings
[2616.40 --> 2616.96]  were rebels.
[2618.26 --> 2619.02]  Both sides.
[2619.12 --> 2619.84]  My older sister
[2619.84 --> 2620.48]  and my younger brother.
[2620.84 --> 2621.62]  I was in the middle
[2621.62 --> 2622.50]  and I always
[2622.50 --> 2623.24]  tried my best
[2623.24 --> 2624.52]  to be that role model
[2624.52 --> 2626.04]  Christian pastor's kid.
[2627.50 --> 2628.74]  And so I thought
[2628.74 --> 2629.82]  I was the one
[2629.82 --> 2630.14]  to say
[2630.14 --> 2631.18]  whereas my sister
[2631.18 --> 2632.06]  probably she has
[2632.06 --> 2633.00]  to work something out.
[2633.48 --> 2634.04]  My brother
[2634.04 --> 2635.10]  he still needs
[2635.10 --> 2636.12]  to work a lot
[2636.12 --> 2636.76]  of things out.
[2637.08 --> 2637.98]  But I'm okay.
[2637.98 --> 2639.82]  I grew up
[2639.82 --> 2641.08]  diligently studying
[2641.08 --> 2641.54]  the Bible,
[2642.12 --> 2643.10]  listening to the
[2643.10 --> 2644.26]  Korean sermons
[2644.26 --> 2644.88]  even though my
[2644.88 --> 2645.62]  Korean was broken,
[2646.24 --> 2647.28]  trying to live
[2647.28 --> 2648.12]  a faithful life.
[2648.86 --> 2649.54]  And there's nothing
[2649.54 --> 2650.20]  against that.
[2650.68 --> 2651.24]  But it was
[2651.24 --> 2652.22]  when my conversion
[2652.22 --> 2653.64]  was when I really
[2653.64 --> 2654.78]  let all that go
[2654.78 --> 2655.74]  and I realized
[2655.74 --> 2657.74]  that it is not
[2657.74 --> 2658.48]  out of my own
[2658.48 --> 2659.44]  religious actions,
[2659.84 --> 2660.90]  but it is only
[2660.90 --> 2661.58]  through the grace
[2661.58 --> 2661.98]  of God
[2661.98 --> 2662.92]  that I am saved.
[2662.92 --> 2664.24]  and that
[2664.24 --> 2666.50]  only by His love
[2666.50 --> 2667.34]  and His grace
[2667.34 --> 2668.86]  do I orient
[2668.86 --> 2669.60]  my whole life
[2669.60 --> 2670.18]  to Him
[2670.18 --> 2671.76]  when I'm confronted
[2671.76 --> 2672.88]  by that truth
[2672.88 --> 2673.40]  and grace.
[2676.72 --> 2678.02]  God heals
[2678.02 --> 2679.26]  and true healing
[2679.26 --> 2680.66]  comes only from Him.
[2681.98 --> 2682.78]  True healing
[2682.78 --> 2683.76]  is our salvation
[2683.76 --> 2684.88]  both here and now
[2684.88 --> 2686.48]  but also not yet.
[2687.40 --> 2688.64]  We are gifted
[2688.64 --> 2689.54]  with this eternal
[2689.54 --> 2690.38]  blessing today
[2690.38 --> 2692.44]  but at the same time
[2692.44 --> 2693.38]  we wait and hope
[2693.38 --> 2694.00]  for the kingdom
[2694.00 --> 2695.74]  to be fully established
[2695.74 --> 2697.40]  and that's the struggle
[2697.40 --> 2698.34]  we are going through.
[2698.82 --> 2700.24]  Orienting our whole lives
[2700.24 --> 2700.84]  for God
[2700.84 --> 2701.98]  when we are still
[2701.98 --> 2702.90]  struggling with sin.
[2704.60 --> 2705.66]  And so through
[2705.66 --> 2706.24]  the witness
[2706.24 --> 2707.44]  of our passage today
[2707.44 --> 2709.36]  God confronts us
[2709.36 --> 2710.66]  all of us here
[2710.66 --> 2712.60]  with truth and grace.
[2713.78 --> 2715.06]  See you are well.
[2715.84 --> 2716.68]  You are freed
[2716.68 --> 2717.56]  from sin
[2717.56 --> 2719.04]  by my grace.
[2720.02 --> 2721.06]  Now in your freedom
[2721.06 --> 2722.12]  live out that
[2722.12 --> 2722.54]  holiness
[2722.54 --> 2724.02]  as the Holy Spirit
[2724.02 --> 2724.62]  leads you
[2724.62 --> 2725.60]  in your life
[2725.60 --> 2727.72]  and let that
[2727.72 --> 2728.36]  overflow
[2728.36 --> 2729.14]  unto others.
[2730.76 --> 2731.62]  Let's pray.
[2741.74 --> 2742.70]  Father God
[2742.70 --> 2743.98]  we thank you
[2743.98 --> 2746.36]  for giving us
[2746.36 --> 2746.90]  your Son
[2746.90 --> 2747.66]  and revealing
[2747.66 --> 2748.70]  Him to us.
[2748.70 --> 2752.74]  Lord we confess
[2752.74 --> 2753.64]  that true healing
[2753.64 --> 2754.70]  only comes from
[2754.70 --> 2754.98]  you.
[2756.60 --> 2757.40]  That whatever
[2757.40 --> 2758.64]  experiences we may
[2758.64 --> 2759.16]  go through
[2759.16 --> 2760.36]  for good or for bad
[2760.36 --> 2763.26]  we acknowledge
[2763.26 --> 2764.40]  that you work
[2764.40 --> 2765.08]  for the good
[2765.08 --> 2766.42]  of those who love
[2766.42 --> 2766.66]  you.
[2768.30 --> 2768.90]  And so Lord
[2768.90 --> 2769.82]  I pray a blessing
[2769.82 --> 2770.52]  that you would

[2794.72 --> 2795.60]  so that we may
[2795.60 --> 2796.78]  come closer to you.

[2797.98 --> 2799.12]  give you all the glory
[2799.12 --> 2800.76]  in whatever we

[2803.62 --> 2804.06]  may be
[2804.06 --> 2804.48]  in
[2804.48 --> 2806.12]  that through
[2806.12 --> 2806.76]  our lives
[2806.76 --> 2808.62]  our whole lives
[2808.62 --> 2809.04]  will be
[2809.04 --> 2810.68]  for your
