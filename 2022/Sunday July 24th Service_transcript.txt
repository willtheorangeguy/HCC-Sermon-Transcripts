[0.00 --> 3.98]  Good morning.
[6.56 --> 9.80]  It's good to be together again.
[11.44 --> 15.36]  I hope you're enjoying your summer time.
[15.52 --> 18.34]  I hope you're getting away a little bit and enjoying the outdoors.
[18.82 --> 23.42]  We just got back from visiting our kids and grandkids in Winnipeg.
[24.06 --> 26.38]  It was really good to be with them.
[26.38 --> 30.26]  And swimming, playing games, eating too much.
[31.56 --> 32.80]  Mosquitoes, not too bad.
[32.88 --> 34.02]  Nothing like Bray Island.
[34.30 --> 35.00]  Nothing like that.
[37.26 --> 39.42]  And there was an amazing thunderstorm.
[40.32 --> 42.32]  And I really like thunderstorms.
[42.42 --> 43.50]  And we don't get that many.
[43.82 --> 45.28]  And we were in a tent trailer.
[46.08 --> 48.20]  And there came the thunder and the lightning.
[48.74 --> 52.88]  And I opened up the screen and watched and listened.
[52.88 --> 55.64]  And I had been working on my sermon.
[56.38 --> 59.72]  And on Psalm 19, it starts,
[59.96 --> 62.82]  The heavens declare the glory of God.
[63.64 --> 67.54]  The skies proclaim the work of His hands.
[68.76 --> 73.22]  And I could really feel that with all that thunder and that lightning.
[74.12 --> 75.50]  And so let me read the rest of it to you.
[75.56 --> 79.08]  Day after day, they pour forth speech.
[79.78 --> 82.34]  Night after night, they reveal knowledge.
[82.34 --> 84.46]  They have no speech.
[84.64 --> 85.78]  They use no words.
[86.00 --> 87.54]  No sound is heard from them.
[88.36 --> 90.66]  Yet their voice goes out into all the earth.
[91.20 --> 92.98]  Their words to the ends of the world.
[93.92 --> 96.92]  In the heavens, God has pitched a tent for the sun.
[97.48 --> 99.54]  It's like a bridegroom coming out of His chamber.
[99.62 --> 102.66]  Like a champion rejoicing to run His course.
[102.92 --> 106.40]  It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other.
[106.40 --> 108.72]  Nothing is deprived of its warmth.
[110.14 --> 113.66]  The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul.
[114.60 --> 117.98]  The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.
[119.02 --> 121.64]  The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart.
[121.98 --> 125.28]  The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.
[125.52 --> 128.04]  The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever.
[128.54 --> 132.50]  The decrees of the Lord are firm, and all of them are righteous.
[132.50 --> 138.44]  They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold.
[138.84 --> 141.98]  They are sweeter than honey, than honey from the honeycomb.
[142.74 --> 144.74]  By them your servant is warned.
[144.90 --> 147.24]  In keeping them, there is great reward.
[148.26 --> 149.96]  But who can discern their own errors?
[151.44 --> 153.28]  Forgive my hidden faults.
[154.26 --> 156.74]  Keep your servant also from willful sins.
[157.16 --> 158.58]  May they not rule over me.
[158.58 --> 163.00]  Then I will be blameless, innocent of great transgressions.
[164.30 --> 169.22]  May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight.
[169.78 --> 173.12]  Lord, my rock and my redeemer.
[174.18 --> 175.36]  The word of the Lord.
[178.08 --> 181.58]  In Judaism, this psalm is recited at Sabbath.
[183.12 --> 187.24]  C.S. Lewis declared Psalm 19 the treasure of the psalm,
[187.24 --> 190.30]  saying, it's the greatest poem in the psalter,
[190.66 --> 193.36]  and one of the greatest lyrics in the world.
[194.88 --> 197.74]  Bach and Hayden composed songs to it,
[198.28 --> 201.86]  because the heavens are telling the glory of God.
[202.34 --> 204.50]  All creation, including us,
[204.88 --> 207.12]  exists to praise God's glory.
[207.66 --> 213.50]  Even our image reflects the image of our God and his glory.
[213.50 --> 215.90]  And we need to let that sink in,
[215.96 --> 217.60]  otherwise they just become words.
[218.12 --> 222.16]  All of it declares there's an awesome God
[222.16 --> 223.74]  who created all of it,
[224.04 --> 225.60]  including us.
[226.90 --> 227.74]  Including us.
[229.60 --> 230.34]  One writer said,
[230.76 --> 233.64]  glory is to God what style is to an artist.
[235.66 --> 239.10]  So Rembrandt's art points to the genius of the artist.
[239.10 --> 243.42]  Mozart's music points to the creativity of Mozart.
[243.76 --> 245.78]  No one else could have done what they did
[245.78 --> 246.96]  in those particular pieces.
[247.58 --> 249.58]  And when I heard the thunder
[249.58 --> 250.96]  and saw the power of lightning,
[251.36 --> 253.50]  then they tell me there is an awesome creator.
[253.92 --> 257.26]  No one else could do this.
[258.52 --> 259.20]  No one else.
[261.18 --> 262.12]  But too often,
[262.42 --> 264.14]  and I'll talk a little bit more about this yet,
[264.20 --> 266.10]  too often people get stuck in the creation
[266.10 --> 267.68]  and miss the creator.
[268.78 --> 270.42]  And then we are somehow deaf
[270.42 --> 272.78]  to the voice found in the song of creation.
[272.78 --> 275.62]  And then the encounter with nature,
[275.74 --> 277.06]  which can get our hearts thumping,
[277.62 --> 281.56]  that encounter fails to change us as it ought to.
[282.82 --> 285.66]  God chose to create in the beginning.
[286.46 --> 288.22]  The world then fell into sin.
[289.22 --> 290.94]  And then God chose again
[290.94 --> 292.88]  to turn toward the world
[292.88 --> 294.04]  through Jesus
[294.04 --> 298.52]  and through the reconciliation of all things.
[299.08 --> 300.62]  And we can hear then
[300.62 --> 301.80]  that creation said,
[302.10 --> 303.16]  there's a creator,
[303.96 --> 305.40]  your creator.
[306.30 --> 308.34]  And then in verse 14,
[308.76 --> 309.36]  we can read,
[309.42 --> 311.00]  and let me read it to you once again.
[313.24 --> 313.68]  That,
[314.46 --> 315.52]  may these words of my mouth
[315.52 --> 316.42]  and meditation of my heart
[316.42 --> 317.32]  be pleasing your sight,
[317.60 --> 319.00]  Lord, my rock and my sight,
[319.30 --> 321.16]  Lord, my rock and my redeemer.
[321.16 --> 323.30]  Then we not only need a creator,
[323.50 --> 324.92]  we need a redeemer.
[325.62 --> 326.84]  And that's why this psalm
[326.84 --> 328.64]  moves from creation
[328.64 --> 330.26]  to the law
[330.26 --> 331.52]  to redemption.
[334.66 --> 335.92]  When you go to verse 7,
[336.04 --> 337.46]  and suddenly we're stuck in heaven,
[337.56 --> 337.88]  declaring,
[338.04 --> 338.56]  and suddenly we're like,
[338.60 --> 339.48]  well, the law is really good.
[339.96 --> 341.44]  There's some scholars who say,
[341.52 --> 341.62]  you know,
[341.64 --> 343.34]  this was more than one psalm.
[343.46 --> 344.72]  But I disagree.
[345.14 --> 347.42]  There's some great intentionality
[347.42 --> 348.52]  in this piece,
[348.52 --> 349.58]  even though it feels
[349.58 --> 351.32]  like an abrupt change
[351.32 --> 352.04]  in verse 7.
[352.78 --> 353.80]  Creation, creation, creation.
[353.86 --> 354.50]  Oh, the law!
[354.68 --> 354.90]  And here we,
[354.96 --> 355.34]  and we're saying,
[355.42 --> 355.88]  whoa, wait a minute.
[356.20 --> 357.42]  How are we going from here to here?
[358.72 --> 360.14]  Paul kinds of gets at it
[360.14 --> 361.16]  in Romans 1.
[361.54 --> 363.02]  And I took it out of the voice,
[363.44 --> 364.84]  a translation that I thought
[364.84 --> 365.76]  said it rather well.
[365.82 --> 366.32]  Look at it with me.
[366.36 --> 367.20]  Romans 1, verse 20,
[367.28 --> 367.90]  where Paul writes,
[368.48 --> 369.50]  from the beginning,
[370.30 --> 371.52]  creation in its magnificence
[372.74 --> 375.36]  enlightens us to his nature.
[375.36 --> 378.62]  Creation itself makes his undying power
[378.62 --> 380.48]  and divine identity clear,
[380.88 --> 382.42]  even though they are invisible.
[383.16 --> 384.86]  And it voids the excuses
[384.86 --> 387.92]  and ignorant claims of these people.
[389.68 --> 391.74]  And the Apostle Paul is calling
[391.74 --> 394.24]  for more than nature appreciation.
[395.30 --> 396.34]  I think it's one of the dangers
[396.34 --> 397.46]  of the beginning,
[397.56 --> 398.66]  the heavens declare the glory of God.
[398.84 --> 399.54]  In a way, it's like,
[399.60 --> 401.40]  oh yeah, I have that awe out there.
[402.22 --> 402.98]  And Paul is saying,
[403.24 --> 404.06]  yeah, that's good,
[404.06 --> 406.50]  but it has to be more than that.
[407.44 --> 408.54]  It has to be a lot more
[408.54 --> 410.02]  than nature appreciation.
[410.78 --> 412.48]  Somehow, more than awe,
[412.54 --> 413.64]  even that awe that I felt
[413.64 --> 414.56]  during that thunderstorm,
[415.00 --> 417.46]  we have a Redeemer creator.
[419.16 --> 421.16]  God didn't want us to miss his glory
[421.16 --> 423.28]  when looking at creation.
[423.64 --> 425.36]  It's why we have eyes to see
[425.36 --> 427.32]  and ears to hear what's all around us.
[427.50 --> 428.72]  It's why we have taste buds
[428.72 --> 431.84]  so we can enjoy the beauty around us,
[431.84 --> 435.22]  but enjoy the taste of an excellent steak
[435.22 --> 436.62]  on a barbecue with a cold beer
[436.62 --> 437.44]  to go along with it.
[437.56 --> 439.60]  It's why we have a mind capable
[439.60 --> 442.70]  of taking note of the experiences
[442.70 --> 443.40]  all around us.
[443.52 --> 445.02]  It's why we're born curious,
[445.24 --> 447.76]  and healthy life involves staying curious.
[448.52 --> 450.52]  The heavens are declaring.
[452.32 --> 454.30]  It's the universal language
[454.30 --> 455.84]  that needs no translation
[455.84 --> 457.14]  to any specific language.
[457.14 --> 460.30]  We can all hear that.
[462.10 --> 464.04]  And this language points to our creator,
[464.44 --> 466.08]  one you can and should worship,
[466.42 --> 468.66]  one you can trust even in your brokenness.
[469.12 --> 471.08]  And that God, our creator,
[471.42 --> 474.96]  has his words of life to speak
[474.96 --> 478.52]  so we can know how life ought to work.
[478.52 --> 483.26]  And that's why when we jump from,
[483.44 --> 484.44]  in verse 7 there, right,
[484.52 --> 485.62]  the law of the Lord is perfect.
[486.12 --> 487.00]  Refreshing the soul,
[487.12 --> 488.14]  rather the translation says,
[488.56 --> 489.90]  reviving the soul.
[491.24 --> 494.14]  Because the soul needs reviving.
[495.70 --> 497.92]  And the focus, the psalmist goes here,
[498.16 --> 500.84]  the focus is no longer now on God's handiwork,
[501.10 --> 503.40]  but on his very words.
[504.14 --> 505.06]  His very words.
[505.06 --> 508.04]  In creation, we meet God.
[508.32 --> 509.34]  The Hebrew is El.
[509.66 --> 511.98]  It's the general word for God.
[512.88 --> 514.16]  That's who we meet in creation.
[514.98 --> 516.16]  But now, the psalmist,
[516.24 --> 517.28]  and others are talking about the law,
[517.48 --> 518.92]  he refers not to El,
[519.08 --> 520.98]  but to Yahweh, the Lord.
[521.12 --> 522.12]  We're getting personal.
[522.28 --> 523.48]  We're getting up close.
[524.74 --> 526.32]  This is what he says.
[526.66 --> 529.30]  Yeah, yeah, this we see as handiwork,
[529.60 --> 532.34]  but this is what he says to you and I.
[533.24 --> 534.82]  This God is speaking.
[535.06 --> 536.00]  And when he does,
[536.20 --> 537.90]  our souls can be revived
[537.90 --> 539.70]  because they need reviving.
[542.70 --> 544.84]  The law, the Torah,
[545.38 --> 547.52]  are instructions on how to live
[547.52 --> 549.16]  in the perfect will of the Father.
[549.60 --> 551.30]  And we have decrees and precepts
[551.30 --> 552.50]  and commands and ordinances,
[552.86 --> 554.12]  words bringing us life,
[554.24 --> 555.04]  giving us wisdom,
[555.16 --> 556.64]  supplying joy and enlightenment,
[557.06 --> 559.24]  giving us challenge and reprimand.
[560.24 --> 562.12]  Words more precious than gold,
[562.50 --> 563.32]  better than honey.
[563.32 --> 567.32]  And we need to be bilingual.
[569.78 --> 571.02]  Fluent in two languages,
[571.12 --> 572.06]  the language of creation
[572.06 --> 573.28]  and the language of Torah,
[573.64 --> 574.70]  of God's words.
[575.30 --> 576.58]  Creation is visual,
[576.86 --> 578.32]  kind of like sign language.
[578.96 --> 580.56]  But the language of Torah
[580.56 --> 582.26]  instructs in wisdom
[582.26 --> 583.64]  and how life works,
[583.84 --> 585.20]  and our Lord is telling us
[585.20 --> 586.04]  how life works.
[586.04 --> 591.00]  I read this quote out of a book
[591.00 --> 592.30]  from Kathleen Norris
[592.30 --> 593.18]  about,
[593.66 --> 594.42]  entitled Dakota,
[594.94 --> 596.12]  where this elementary school girl
[596.12 --> 597.28]  moves to North Dakota,
[597.94 --> 599.66]  big change from where she came from,
[599.92 --> 600.56]  and she writes,
[600.66 --> 602.36]  the sky is full of blue
[602.36 --> 604.62]  and full of the mind of God.
[604.62 --> 607.56]  I like that.
[609.06 --> 609.50]  You know that,
[610.02 --> 611.38]  if you've been in the prairies,
[611.50 --> 611.66]  right,
[611.70 --> 612.38]  it's big sky,
[612.52 --> 612.72]  right?
[612.94 --> 614.08]  It's full of blue,
[614.22 --> 614.48]  and yet,
[614.78 --> 615.12]  wow,
[615.22 --> 615.58]  look at that,
[615.64 --> 616.08]  how beautiful,
[616.18 --> 616.52]  how blue,
[616.60 --> 617.02]  how big,
[617.86 --> 618.50]  and it's somehow
[618.50 --> 620.32]  full of the mind of God.
[620.32 --> 625.10]  You know,
[625.18 --> 625.92]  but this isn't
[625.92 --> 627.30]  the full revelation of God.
[629.30 --> 629.70]  God,
[629.82 --> 630.36]  the creator,
[630.52 --> 632.38]  used his words to create.
[632.80 --> 633.72]  Let there be light,
[633.80 --> 634.34]  and there was light.
[634.42 --> 634.80]  Let there be,
[634.88 --> 635.22]  let there be,
[635.28 --> 635.66]  let there be,
[635.74 --> 636.34]  and it was good,
[636.42 --> 636.94]  very good.
[638.04 --> 639.90]  Words that brought order
[639.90 --> 641.58]  out of chaos.
[641.80 --> 642.46]  That's what we read
[642.46 --> 643.74]  in the story of Genesis,
[644.12 --> 644.52]  out of chaos.
[644.70 --> 645.80]  And our creator speaks
[645.80 --> 647.20]  the words of law,
[647.56 --> 648.96]  inviting us to live
[648.96 --> 649.94]  within the orderliness
[649.94 --> 650.62]  of life
[650.62 --> 651.20]  in the midst
[651.20 --> 652.80]  of an often chaotic world.
[654.60 --> 655.66]  Let's be honest.
[656.74 --> 658.02]  When we look around,
[659.52 --> 660.42]  when we look within,
[660.96 --> 662.00]  there's a lot of brokenness,
[662.04 --> 662.68]  a lot of disorder,
[662.80 --> 663.56]  a lot of chaos.
[663.72 --> 664.30]  Don't you agree?
[665.98 --> 666.70]  E.B. White,
[666.88 --> 668.26]  the writer of Charlotte's Web,
[668.34 --> 668.66]  wrote,
[669.62 --> 670.70]  and I can picture this,
[671.40 --> 672.58]  I arise in the morning
[672.58 --> 674.22]  torn between a desire
[674.22 --> 675.30]  to improve the world
[675.30 --> 676.36]  and a desire
[676.36 --> 677.38]  to enjoy the world,
[678.02 --> 678.84]  and this makes it
[678.84 --> 679.84]  hard to plan.
[679.94 --> 683.62]  Because we need both.
[685.24 --> 686.64]  We see the disorder,
[686.92 --> 687.12]  right?
[688.26 --> 688.66]  Creation,
[688.98 --> 689.06]  ah,
[689.36 --> 689.74]  ah,
[690.14 --> 690.66]  amazing,
[690.86 --> 691.12]  thunder,
[691.22 --> 691.42]  lightning,
[691.56 --> 691.80]  ah,
[691.96 --> 692.20]  wow,
[692.28 --> 693.00]  there is a God,
[693.36 --> 694.32]  he's wonderful.
[695.00 --> 695.44]  Droughts,
[695.56 --> 695.98]  fires,
[696.24 --> 696.56]  wars,
[696.72 --> 696.86]  ah,
[697.36 --> 697.68]  ah,
[697.98 --> 698.38]  disorder,
[698.54 --> 698.92]  chaos.
[699.28 --> 699.48]  Me,
[699.62 --> 699.84]  you,
[700.00 --> 700.50]  celebrate,
[700.84 --> 701.20]  that one,
[701.30 --> 701.50]  you know,
[701.58 --> 702.22]  celebrate,
[702.40 --> 703.66]  image bearer of God.
[704.06 --> 704.30]  Wow,
[704.44 --> 705.48]  wondrously made,
[705.48 --> 706.44]  the psalmist says,
[706.80 --> 706.98]  yeah,
[707.28 --> 708.28]  lawbreakers,
[709.80 --> 710.22]  broken,
[710.70 --> 711.60]  messy people,
[712.96 --> 713.98]  often self-centered.
[717.30 --> 718.14]  The law,
[718.32 --> 720.14]  more desired than gold
[720.14 --> 720.68]  or honey.
[721.96 --> 723.28]  Do you long for God's law
[723.28 --> 723.74]  that way?
[725.34 --> 727.16]  You desire God's law,
[727.16 --> 727.92]  if I say,
[728.30 --> 729.58]  here's a pile of gold,
[729.74 --> 731.62]  here's the law,
[732.44 --> 733.16]  pick one.
[734.52 --> 734.78]  Right?
[734.88 --> 735.00]  I mean,
[735.06 --> 735.48]  oh,
[735.64 --> 736.76]  the law for sure
[736.76 --> 737.56]  because it's way better
[737.56 --> 738.00]  than that,
[738.20 --> 739.20]  which it is,
[740.58 --> 742.24]  but I don't think
[742.24 --> 742.58]  we always,
[742.72 --> 742.86]  you know,
[743.06 --> 744.08]  sometimes I do,
[744.22 --> 744.50]  you know,
[744.50 --> 745.26]  I read God's law
[745.26 --> 745.46]  and say,
[745.50 --> 745.82]  oh man,
[745.88 --> 745.98]  you know,
[745.98 --> 746.78]  I can see how,
[747.30 --> 748.56]  what a wise way of living
[748.56 --> 749.90]  that God provides for us,
[750.22 --> 750.68]  but you know,
[750.72 --> 752.06]  sometimes I'd rather
[752.06 --> 754.12]  just do what I want to do.
[756.60 --> 757.98]  Sometimes God's law
[757.98 --> 759.98]  feel like a downright killjoy
[759.98 --> 763.78]  when I'm stuck in myself.
[766.50 --> 767.72]  I'm not proud of that.
[769.26 --> 769.44]  Now,
[769.48 --> 769.96]  here's the irony.
[770.58 --> 771.68]  When I go that way
[771.68 --> 772.86]  and live for myself,
[773.12 --> 774.94]  eventually life goes pretty poorly
[774.94 --> 777.48]  life becomes chaotic
[777.48 --> 779.64]  and I eventually tire
[779.64 --> 780.72]  of living outside
[780.72 --> 782.22]  of the Creator's wise ways
[782.22 --> 783.26]  because I know
[783.26 --> 784.32]  He is the one
[784.32 --> 785.26]  who tells me
[785.26 --> 786.46]  how life ought to go
[786.46 --> 787.78]  for my sake.
[789.50 --> 790.44]  And then I grab
[790.44 --> 791.40]  onto the law again,
[791.60 --> 792.62]  onto God's ways again
[792.62 --> 793.62]  and I strive
[793.62 --> 794.54]  to live those out.
[795.04 --> 795.96]  But I need help.
[796.08 --> 796.76]  I need help for that
[796.76 --> 798.22]  and I long for God
[798.22 --> 799.48]  to give me the understanding
[799.48 --> 800.54]  I need to do that.
[801.12 --> 801.76]  Because isn't that
[801.76 --> 802.86]  what sin does to us?
[803.10 --> 804.70]  It keeps you just living
[804.70 --> 805.38]  for yourself,
[805.56 --> 806.76]  living for your wants.
[809.14 --> 809.34]  You know,
[809.48 --> 810.82]  it started off that way.
[810.88 --> 811.72]  The serpent said to Eve,
[811.76 --> 812.84]  you will be like God.
[812.90 --> 813.62]  That's what we want,
[813.68 --> 814.04]  isn't it?
[814.44 --> 814.76]  Somewhere.
[816.34 --> 817.48]  I want to be in charge.
[817.58 --> 818.48]  I want to be in control.
[818.60 --> 819.58]  I want to make the decisions.
[820.02 --> 820.34]  And so,
[820.56 --> 820.74]  you know,
[820.80 --> 822.18]  we try to become like God
[822.18 --> 823.02]  or we pick one
[823.02 --> 823.90]  we can manage.
[826.70 --> 827.64]  In our psalm,
[827.70 --> 828.20]  it's the Son.
[828.20 --> 828.36]  Right?
[829.36 --> 829.80]  You know,
[830.26 --> 830.74]  you read
[830.74 --> 834.42]  in verse 4,
[835.46 --> 836.72]  let me read it to you again.
[837.72 --> 838.22]  In the heavens,
[838.36 --> 839.62]  God has pitched a tent
[839.62 --> 840.56]  for the sun.
[840.74 --> 841.32]  And then he goes on
[841.32 --> 842.20]  to describe how that
[842.20 --> 843.20]  sun moves.
[843.48 --> 844.98]  Why is he bringing up
[844.98 --> 845.34]  the sun?
[845.40 --> 846.06]  Because the sun
[846.06 --> 846.82]  in the ancient world
[846.82 --> 847.50]  was a God,
[847.72 --> 849.06]  at least in many cultures.
[849.84 --> 850.88]  And the psalmist
[850.88 --> 851.92]  is very intentional to say,
[852.38 --> 854.02]  the Lord pitched a tent
[854.02 --> 854.60]  for the sun.
[854.68 --> 855.62]  He put the sun
[855.62 --> 856.28]  in its place
[856.28 --> 857.82]  and it runs its course.
[858.20 --> 858.88]  So, no, no,
[858.98 --> 860.48]  the sun is not a God.
[860.66 --> 861.74]  He's being very clear
[861.74 --> 862.36]  about that here.
[863.70 --> 865.14]  Nature very easily
[865.14 --> 866.40]  becomes a God
[866.40 --> 866.88]  for many.
[867.18 --> 868.02]  And then we worship
[868.02 --> 868.66]  the creation
[868.66 --> 869.52]  without acknowledging
[869.52 --> 870.92]  the creator.
[872.26 --> 873.32]  And it's kind of like
[873.32 --> 875.36]  praising a painting
[875.36 --> 876.56]  pretending it was
[876.56 --> 877.30]  never painted.
[879.30 --> 879.70]  Right?
[879.98 --> 880.34]  Oh,
[880.58 --> 881.88]  what an amazing painting.
[882.28 --> 882.64]  Rembrandt,
[882.78 --> 883.72]  who cares about Rembrandt?
[883.72 --> 885.12]  What an amazing painting.
[885.28 --> 885.38]  Right?
[885.58 --> 885.82]  And you say,
[885.86 --> 885.98]  wow,
[886.04 --> 886.82]  but you should know
[886.82 --> 887.68]  the one who painted it.
[887.92 --> 888.72]  And Paul says,
[888.96 --> 889.74]  in Romans 1.20,
[889.84 --> 890.00]  he said,
[890.28 --> 892.22]  you have no excuses.
[895.24 --> 896.60]  If you look around
[896.60 --> 898.26]  and you see all the wonders
[898.26 --> 899.44]  of the world around you
[899.44 --> 901.12]  and you don't eventually ask,
[901.40 --> 901.62]  gee,
[901.92 --> 903.22]  who's the artist here?
[905.02 --> 905.88]  Who's the artist?
[907.50 --> 908.32]  You ought to wrestle
[908.32 --> 909.04]  with that a little bit.
[909.12 --> 909.38]  Paul said,
[909.42 --> 910.06]  you have no excuses.
[910.50 --> 912.10]  The creator created the sun
[912.10 --> 912.92]  and set its courses.
[912.92 --> 913.80]  And so,
[913.96 --> 914.74]  we are called
[914.74 --> 915.48]  by this creator
[915.48 --> 916.60]  to live in ways
[916.60 --> 917.86]  that bring life.
[921.24 --> 921.56]  In a way,
[921.72 --> 922.78]  think of the laws
[922.78 --> 924.82]  as an owner's manual.
[926.24 --> 926.66]  Right?
[926.74 --> 928.18]  A car owner might decide,
[928.72 --> 929.48]  gets out his manual,
[929.64 --> 929.74]  go,
[929.80 --> 929.96]  ah,
[930.64 --> 932.28]  there's a lot of stuff in here,
[932.32 --> 933.34]  a lot of rules.
[934.10 --> 935.36]  I think I know better.
[935.88 --> 937.06]  I'm going to do it my way.
[937.46 --> 937.94]  And you know what?
[938.06 --> 939.62]  Gas is super expensive.
[939.62 --> 941.60]  I think this water
[941.60 --> 943.06]  will do just fine.
[944.26 --> 945.38]  It's a whole lot cheaper.
[945.76 --> 946.80]  I'm using water.
[947.98 --> 949.06]  And pretty soon,
[949.34 --> 951.12]  his life grinds to a halt.
[952.36 --> 953.26]  And apparently,
[953.46 --> 954.12]  the designers
[954.12 --> 956.64]  knew what they were talking about.
[959.46 --> 960.68]  Wisdom says,
[961.42 --> 962.62]  the creator understands
[962.62 --> 963.74]  how life works
[963.74 --> 965.92]  better than you and I do.
[965.92 --> 968.12]  That's what wisdom says.
[969.50 --> 971.06]  Want your soul revived?
[971.80 --> 972.72]  Live like this.
[974.08 --> 975.28]  Don't want your soul revived?
[976.24 --> 977.20]  Go your own way.
[977.94 --> 978.64]  It's up to you.
[978.64 --> 981.20]  We have the revelation
[981.20 --> 981.98]  of creation.
[982.68 --> 983.68]  We have the revelation
[983.68 --> 984.66]  of the law.
[985.76 --> 986.62]  And then we come to
[986.62 --> 987.82]  verse 12 and 13
[987.82 --> 989.66]  and we take another shift again.
[990.74 --> 991.52]  The psalmist writes,
[991.72 --> 992.80]  but who can discern
[992.80 --> 993.74]  their own errors?
[994.12 --> 994.94]  Okay, fair question.
[995.30 --> 996.02]  Who can discern?
[996.38 --> 998.12]  Are you really paying attention
[998.12 --> 999.02]  to the way you live?
[999.20 --> 1000.28]  Do you really know
[1000.28 --> 1001.12]  what's going on?
[1001.30 --> 1002.10]  Do you really know
[1002.10 --> 1002.68]  what's implied
[1002.68 --> 1003.70]  by all the choices you make?
[1003.88 --> 1004.76]  Do you really know
[1004.76 --> 1005.42]  how messed up
[1005.42 --> 1006.64]  some of your thinking is sometimes?
[1007.62 --> 1008.52]  That's kind of what he's saying.
[1008.80 --> 1010.02]  Do you discern your errors?
[1011.72 --> 1013.34]  Because I tell you,
[1013.38 --> 1013.98]  a lot of us,
[1014.28 --> 1014.98]  most of us,
[1015.06 --> 1016.96]  are blind to some aspects
[1016.96 --> 1018.24]  of our own brokenness
[1018.24 --> 1019.92]  and how it operates
[1019.92 --> 1020.56]  in our marriages,
[1020.70 --> 1021.16]  in our lives,
[1021.20 --> 1021.82]  and the way we live.
[1026.74 --> 1027.76]  And so the psalmist,
[1027.94 --> 1028.10]  yeah,
[1028.26 --> 1028.62]  says,
[1028.80 --> 1030.48]  forgive my hidden faults,
[1030.72 --> 1031.38]  keep your servants
[1031.38 --> 1032.86]  also from willful sins
[1032.86 --> 1033.62]  that they may not
[1033.62 --> 1034.32]  rule over me.
[1034.60 --> 1035.62]  Then I will be blameless
[1035.62 --> 1035.98]  and innocent
[1035.98 --> 1038.12]  of great transgressions.
[1038.52 --> 1040.92]  And very quickly,
[1041.24 --> 1043.48]  we come to a new place again.
[1043.80 --> 1045.24]  The psalmist recognizes
[1045.24 --> 1046.16]  his brokenness
[1046.16 --> 1046.92]  and disobedience.
[1047.88 --> 1049.04]  And the priceless gold
[1049.04 --> 1050.34]  that has been offered to him
[1050.34 --> 1051.34]  has been ignored
[1051.34 --> 1051.90]  and replaced
[1051.90 --> 1053.00]  by fool's gold,
[1053.38 --> 1053.76]  sinful,
[1053.98 --> 1055.38]  empty God substitutes.
[1055.50 --> 1056.62]  And you can look
[1056.62 --> 1057.12]  in your own life
[1057.12 --> 1058.16]  and see where yours are.
[1058.16 --> 1062.56]  And even with creation declaring,
[1063.26 --> 1065.22]  and even with clear words
[1065.22 --> 1066.12]  of wisdom,
[1067.36 --> 1069.78]  somehow more is needed.
[1071.70 --> 1073.14]  See the beauty of the mountains?
[1073.68 --> 1074.52]  Yeah, there's a God.
[1076.44 --> 1077.92]  I get the words of God,
[1078.22 --> 1079.36]  the law, wisdom.
[1080.32 --> 1081.68]  Yeah, those are words of life.
[1081.68 --> 1084.46]  It ought to be enough,
[1085.14 --> 1086.66]  but it isn't.
[1086.78 --> 1087.06]  Why?
[1088.26 --> 1090.36]  Because I can't discern
[1090.36 --> 1093.82]  even my own brokenness completely.
[1093.82 --> 1101.10]  And the psalmist acknowledges
[1101.10 --> 1103.06]  with Jeremiah
[1103.06 --> 1104.88]  in Jeremiah 17
[1104.88 --> 1106.28]  where Jeremiah says,
[1106.60 --> 1108.34]  the heart is deceitful
[1108.34 --> 1109.42]  above all things
[1109.42 --> 1110.72]  and beyond cure.
[1111.18 --> 1112.90]  Who can understand it?
[1113.98 --> 1114.94]  And the psalmist is saying
[1114.94 --> 1116.32]  the same thing.
[1116.38 --> 1117.30]  Who can understand it?
[1117.60 --> 1119.62]  We have hidden sins.
[1119.76 --> 1120.22]  Hidden sins.
[1120.22 --> 1121.56]  Sins we don't even know are there
[1121.56 --> 1123.24]  or don't want brought
[1123.24 --> 1124.28]  into the light.
[1126.30 --> 1126.78]  Right?
[1126.82 --> 1127.78]  Let's have a moment
[1127.78 --> 1128.50]  of opportunity.
[1128.62 --> 1129.38]  All of us will come up
[1129.38 --> 1131.12]  and share our deepest,
[1131.34 --> 1131.78]  darkest sins
[1131.78 --> 1132.74]  to the church right now.
[1132.84 --> 1132.96]  I mean,
[1133.04 --> 1134.24]  oh, wonderful idea.
[1136.36 --> 1136.80]  Right?
[1136.94 --> 1137.56]  We want that.
[1139.38 --> 1140.78]  Sometimes they're hidden
[1140.78 --> 1142.32]  because we're so ashamed.
[1142.44 --> 1143.30]  We hide them.
[1145.88 --> 1147.20]  I remember hearing about
[1147.20 --> 1148.74]  sins of omission.
[1148.74 --> 1149.22]  Right?
[1149.22 --> 1151.46]  Sins the good
[1151.46 --> 1152.34]  you could have done
[1152.34 --> 1153.66]  and didn't do it.
[1153.86 --> 1154.60]  You didn't do anything
[1154.60 --> 1155.96]  particularly wrong
[1155.96 --> 1157.18]  but you had an opportunity
[1157.18 --> 1157.98]  to do some good
[1157.98 --> 1158.72]  and you ignored it.
[1158.94 --> 1159.10]  Right?
[1159.22 --> 1159.44]  Yeah,
[1159.56 --> 1160.64]  those kinds of things too.
[1160.70 --> 1161.46]  Are you missing some of that
[1161.46 --> 1161.84]  in your life?
[1161.90 --> 1162.78]  I know I am.
[1164.26 --> 1165.24]  And then he talks about
[1165.24 --> 1165.92]  willful sins.
[1166.96 --> 1168.12]  I know it's wrong
[1168.12 --> 1169.78]  and I do it anyways.
[1170.86 --> 1172.12]  Maybe I can't even help myself.
[1173.76 --> 1174.74]  And notice the psalmist
[1174.74 --> 1175.24]  in that point
[1175.24 --> 1176.40]  doesn't ask so much
[1176.40 --> 1176.88]  for forgiveness
[1176.88 --> 1178.44]  as he asks for the Lord
[1178.44 --> 1179.40]  to keep your servant
[1179.40 --> 1180.24]  from such sins.
[1180.56 --> 1181.12]  Kind of like
[1181.12 --> 1182.78]  what the Lord's prayer says
[1182.78 --> 1184.22]  lead us not into temptation.
[1184.40 --> 1184.50]  Right?
[1184.66 --> 1185.80]  And it's about prevention
[1185.80 --> 1186.44]  prior to
[1186.44 --> 1187.72]  than just asking for forgiveness.
[1189.16 --> 1190.92]  And we begin to see here
[1190.92 --> 1191.44]  you know,
[1191.48 --> 1192.48]  when the psalmist talks about
[1192.48 --> 1194.38]  this being blameless.
[1194.84 --> 1195.00]  Yeah,
[1195.08 --> 1197.12]  because we need to be blameless
[1197.12 --> 1198.72]  that we then see
[1198.72 --> 1199.70]  how much grace
[1199.70 --> 1200.82]  is needed.
[1202.08 --> 1203.10]  Grace is needed.
[1206.32 --> 1207.76]  As one scholar said,
[1208.48 --> 1210.02]  it's not the law
[1210.02 --> 1211.18]  that makes the psalmist
[1211.18 --> 1211.82]  blameless,
[1212.36 --> 1213.22]  it's the law giver.
[1214.52 --> 1215.02]  So yes,
[1215.66 --> 1216.88]  here's the next layer.
[1217.40 --> 1218.20]  There's creation,
[1218.68 --> 1219.60]  there's the law,
[1220.60 --> 1222.10]  but I need a redeemer.
[1222.10 --> 1224.84]  I need a redeemer.
[1225.78 --> 1226.54]  In the Hebrew,
[1226.68 --> 1227.64]  the word is goel,
[1228.24 --> 1228.86]  redeemer.
[1229.48 --> 1230.12]  And a redeemer
[1230.12 --> 1231.36]  accepts the responsibility
[1231.36 --> 1232.72]  for someone in trouble,
[1232.82 --> 1233.80]  often a family member.
[1234.44 --> 1235.52]  And if this family member
[1235.52 --> 1236.74]  fell in hard times,
[1237.08 --> 1237.92]  that redeemer,
[1238.24 --> 1238.94]  that goel,
[1239.14 --> 1239.96]  would step in
[1239.96 --> 1241.24]  and pay some debts off.
[1241.48 --> 1242.40]  Or that goel
[1242.40 --> 1243.44]  would buy that person
[1243.44 --> 1244.32]  out of slavery
[1244.32 --> 1245.04]  because they've gotten
[1245.04 --> 1246.72]  themselves in a real mess.
[1248.40 --> 1249.70]  Look what the Apostle Paul
[1249.70 --> 1251.12]  says in Galatians 4.
[1251.12 --> 1253.38]  That sounds quite familiar
[1253.38 --> 1254.10]  to all that.
[1254.98 --> 1255.56]  Where Paul writes,
[1255.70 --> 1257.36]  but when the set time
[1257.36 --> 1258.10]  had fully come,
[1258.46 --> 1259.50]  God sent his son,
[1259.98 --> 1260.70]  born of a woman,
[1260.94 --> 1262.22]  born under the law,
[1262.74 --> 1264.20]  to redeem those
[1264.20 --> 1265.52]  under the law
[1265.52 --> 1266.98]  that we might receive
[1266.98 --> 1268.62]  adoption to sonship.
[1269.34 --> 1270.18]  Because you are
[1270.18 --> 1271.40]  his sons and daughters,
[1271.88 --> 1272.98]  God sent his spirit
[1272.98 --> 1273.74]  of his son
[1273.74 --> 1274.68]  into your hearts,
[1274.96 --> 1276.08]  the spirit who calls out
[1276.08 --> 1276.72]  Abba, Father.
[1277.14 --> 1278.80]  So you are no longer
[1278.80 --> 1279.46]  a slave.
[1279.76 --> 1279.96]  Why?
[1280.06 --> 1280.74]  Well, you've been redeemed.
[1280.74 --> 1281.78]  You are no longer
[1281.78 --> 1282.16]  a slave,
[1282.26 --> 1282.98]  but a child of God.
[1283.04 --> 1283.52]  And since you are
[1283.52 --> 1284.14]  his child,
[1284.46 --> 1285.94]  God has also made you
[1285.94 --> 1287.18]  an heir.
[1288.52 --> 1289.70]  And somehow you go
[1289.70 --> 1291.06]  from slave
[1291.06 --> 1292.76]  to heir
[1292.76 --> 1293.62]  of the kingdom.
[1293.62 --> 1301.08]  and here at the end
[1301.08 --> 1301.78]  of the psalm,
[1301.78 --> 1302.66]  the psalmist says,
[1303.78 --> 1304.64]  it really doesn't matter
[1304.64 --> 1305.60]  how much revelation
[1305.60 --> 1306.56]  you have.
[1307.78 --> 1308.64]  It doesn't matter
[1308.64 --> 1309.54]  how much
[1309.54 --> 1311.18]  of God's will
[1311.18 --> 1311.66]  you know,
[1311.78 --> 1312.64]  how hard you try
[1312.64 --> 1313.18]  to follow it,
[1313.36 --> 1314.18]  you need
[1314.18 --> 1315.00]  a redeemer.
[1316.58 --> 1317.88]  You are a sinner
[1317.88 --> 1319.04]  and you need
[1319.04 --> 1319.68]  to repent.
[1320.10 --> 1320.96]  And your redeemer
[1320.96 --> 1321.84]  needs to cover
[1321.84 --> 1322.44]  your debts
[1322.44 --> 1323.18]  and free you
[1323.18 --> 1323.76]  from slavery
[1323.76 --> 1324.48]  because you
[1324.48 --> 1325.86]  can't do it.
[1326.94 --> 1327.72]  And if you think
[1327.72 --> 1328.44]  you don't need
[1328.44 --> 1328.96]  a redeemer,
[1329.32 --> 1330.56]  you're not paying
[1330.56 --> 1331.70]  attention to the
[1331.70 --> 1333.18]  revelations around you.
[1333.56 --> 1334.66]  And you'll be stuck
[1334.66 --> 1335.40]  in chaos
[1335.40 --> 1336.92]  and stuck in slavery.
[1340.76 --> 1341.38]  When I look
[1341.38 --> 1341.94]  at creation,
[1342.42 --> 1342.82]  I hear,
[1343.04 --> 1343.54]  there's a God,
[1343.68 --> 1344.26]  there's a creator.
[1344.80 --> 1345.90]  When I hear the law,
[1346.02 --> 1346.24]  I say,
[1346.30 --> 1346.48]  yeah,
[1346.66 --> 1347.64]  I know that's the way
[1347.64 --> 1347.96]  to live.
[1347.96 --> 1349.12]  And when I look
[1349.12 --> 1349.68]  into my heart,
[1349.80 --> 1350.46]  I see I need
[1350.46 --> 1350.90]  a redeemer.
[1351.22 --> 1351.78]  And I need to
[1351.78 --> 1352.66]  surrender to his
[1352.66 --> 1352.98]  will.
[1353.38 --> 1354.08]  And with the power
[1354.08 --> 1354.88]  of the Holy Spirit,
[1355.02 --> 1355.88]  I learn to follow
[1355.88 --> 1356.54]  in the ways of the
[1356.54 --> 1356.74]  Lord,
[1356.98 --> 1358.06]  knowing he redeems
[1358.06 --> 1359.12]  me and continues
[1359.12 --> 1360.02]  to redeem me.
[1360.38 --> 1361.18]  And so we began
[1361.18 --> 1361.94]  this psalm with
[1361.94 --> 1363.20]  creation and we
[1363.20 --> 1364.38]  end with redemption.
[1366.06 --> 1366.88]  And we live in
[1366.88 --> 1367.84]  not just an elegant
[1367.84 --> 1368.44]  universe,
[1368.84 --> 1369.54]  but in one that
[1369.54 --> 1370.30]  is redeemed.
[1371.10 --> 1371.96]  And then we say
[1371.96 --> 1372.68]  with the psalmist,
[1373.16 --> 1373.90]  at the very end
[1373.90 --> 1374.34]  of the psalm,
[1374.34 --> 1375.28]  then may the
[1375.28 --> 1376.34]  words of my mouth
[1376.34 --> 1377.28]  and the meditations
[1377.28 --> 1378.00]  of my heart
[1378.00 --> 1378.92]  be acceptable.
[1380.30 --> 1380.98]  Be acceptable
[1380.98 --> 1381.62]  is a bit of a
[1381.62 --> 1382.42]  technical term
[1382.42 --> 1383.58]  for sacrifices.
[1383.98 --> 1384.64]  It's a Hebrew word
[1384.64 --> 1386.34]  for the sacrifices
[1386.34 --> 1387.00]  that were offered
[1387.00 --> 1387.62]  in the temple.
[1388.02 --> 1388.56]  And the psalmist
[1388.56 --> 1389.72]  sees his whole life
[1389.72 --> 1390.76]  as an offering
[1390.76 --> 1391.40]  to the Lord,
[1391.92 --> 1392.78]  the Lord,
[1392.86 --> 1393.34]  our creator,
[1393.46 --> 1394.04]  our redeemer.
[1394.82 --> 1395.54]  Just like Paul
[1395.54 --> 1397.32]  writes in Romans
[1397.32 --> 1398.02]  12, 1,
[1398.26 --> 1398.60]  where he says,
[1398.68 --> 1399.34]  therefore I urge
[1399.34 --> 1400.10]  you brothers and
[1400.10 --> 1400.58]  sisters,
[1401.16 --> 1402.20]  in view of God's
[1402.20 --> 1402.44]  mercy,
[1402.54 --> 1403.44]  to offer your bodies
[1403.44 --> 1404.32]  as living sacrifices,
[1404.34 --> 1407.26]  acceptable sacrifices,
[1407.64 --> 1408.34]  holy and pleasing
[1408.34 --> 1408.80]  to God.
[1409.08 --> 1409.88]  This is your true
[1409.88 --> 1410.82]  and proper worship.
[1411.60 --> 1412.00]  And we learn
[1412.00 --> 1413.14]  to realign our lives
[1413.14 --> 1414.66]  to our created purposes.
[1415.48 --> 1416.72]  Yes, creation speaks
[1416.72 --> 1418.40]  without words,
[1418.82 --> 1419.76]  but it's not enough.
[1419.80 --> 1420.28]  It's a start,
[1420.38 --> 1420.86]  but it's not enough.
[1421.14 --> 1421.92]  And then we hear
[1421.92 --> 1423.78]  the laws
[1423.78 --> 1426.48]  and we realize
[1426.48 --> 1427.50]  that we can't keep them.
[1428.46 --> 1429.12]  There are a lot of people
[1429.12 --> 1429.80]  or some people
[1429.80 --> 1430.26]  who say,
[1430.54 --> 1430.84]  you know what,
[1430.92 --> 1432.28]  I really don't need
[1432.28 --> 1432.78]  a church.
[1432.94 --> 1434.08]  Nature is my church.
[1434.34 --> 1436.20]  And I say,
[1436.28 --> 1436.46]  you know,
[1436.72 --> 1438.20]  you can see God there,
[1438.28 --> 1438.90]  but it's not enough.
[1439.60 --> 1441.00]  It declares God.
[1441.56 --> 1442.92]  But you need to hear
[1442.92 --> 1444.36]  Yahweh's own words
[1444.36 --> 1445.44]  on how life works.
[1446.46 --> 1447.50]  And you need to see
[1447.50 --> 1448.28]  your desperate need
[1448.28 --> 1448.98]  for a redeemer.
[1449.44 --> 1450.38]  And you need all
[1450.38 --> 1451.08]  that revelation,
[1451.22 --> 1452.04]  not just some of it.
[1452.88 --> 1454.32]  And we can know
[1454.32 --> 1455.56]  God's glory
[1455.56 --> 1456.66]  from nature,
[1456.88 --> 1458.46]  but not his grace.
[1458.46 --> 1461.04]  And nature can give you
[1461.04 --> 1461.72]  a sense of awe
[1461.72 --> 1462.24]  and wonder,
[1462.84 --> 1463.76]  but it can't show you
[1463.76 --> 1464.54]  what God is like
[1464.54 --> 1465.02]  and lead you
[1465.02 --> 1465.68]  into a relationship
[1465.68 --> 1466.22]  with him.
[1466.92 --> 1467.68]  And it can show you
[1467.68 --> 1467.96]  how to,
[1468.20 --> 1469.18]  it can't show you
[1469.18 --> 1469.90]  how to live well,
[1470.14 --> 1472.20]  and nature can't save you.
[1473.90 --> 1474.30]  So,
[1474.40 --> 1475.14]  let the words
[1475.14 --> 1476.48]  of my mouth
[1476.48 --> 1478.78]  and the meditation
[1478.78 --> 1480.38]  of my heart
[1480.38 --> 1481.84]  be acceptable
[1481.84 --> 1482.40]  to you,
[1482.50 --> 1482.68]  Lord.
[1482.68 --> 1486.14]  and we have
[1486.14 --> 1486.90]  this opportunity
[1486.90 --> 1488.00]  to join in
[1488.00 --> 1488.66]  the words.
[1492.00 --> 1493.22]  We have the opportunity
[1493.22 --> 1494.64]  to share words of life
[1494.64 --> 1495.74]  and words of redemption
[1495.74 --> 1496.92]  in life.
[1498.42 --> 1498.54]  Now,
[1498.60 --> 1499.28]  just picturing this,
[1499.38 --> 1499.80]  what if,
[1500.06 --> 1500.94]  you look at your life,
[1501.10 --> 1502.12]  but what if just before you,
[1502.20 --> 1502.64]  for example,
[1503.00 --> 1504.06]  discipline your child,
[1504.14 --> 1505.24]  you stopped and prayed,
[1506.12 --> 1506.92]  let the words
[1506.92 --> 1507.68]  of my mouth
[1507.68 --> 1508.54]  and the meditations
[1508.54 --> 1509.30]  of my heart
[1509.30 --> 1510.40]  be acceptable to you,
[1510.60 --> 1511.08]  my Lord
[1511.08 --> 1512.14]  and my Redeemer.
[1512.68 --> 1514.52]  And what if,
[1514.62 --> 1515.20]  just before this,
[1515.56 --> 1516.58]  a meeting,
[1516.86 --> 1517.68]  before you get
[1517.68 --> 1518.18]  into this meeting,
[1518.26 --> 1518.56]  there's a lot
[1518.56 --> 1519.20]  that's going to happen,
[1519.26 --> 1519.44]  you say,
[1519.70 --> 1520.22]  let the words
[1520.22 --> 1520.74]  of my mouth
[1520.74 --> 1521.20]  and the meditation
[1521.20 --> 1521.60]  of my heart
[1521.60 --> 1522.52]  be acceptable to you,
[1522.64 --> 1523.06]  my Lord
[1523.06 --> 1523.78]  and my Redeemer.
[1523.98 --> 1524.50]  And what if,
[1524.64 --> 1525.04]  before you,
[1525.14 --> 1526.06]  you had this difficult
[1526.06 --> 1526.40]  visit,
[1526.48 --> 1526.80]  you prayed,
[1527.04 --> 1527.62]  let the words
[1527.62 --> 1528.16]  of my mouth
[1528.16 --> 1528.80]  and the meditation
[1528.80 --> 1529.32]  of my heart
[1529.32 --> 1530.54]  be acceptable to you,
[1530.62 --> 1530.76]  Lord,
[1530.96 --> 1531.94]  my Redeemer.
[1536.56 --> 1537.68]  What if that became
[1537.68 --> 1539.00]  just how you live life?
[1540.94 --> 1541.32]  And I know
[1541.32 --> 1542.38]  that's a daunting challenge
[1542.38 --> 1543.18]  because too often
[1543.18 --> 1544.54]  my word,
[1544.64 --> 1545.28]  maybe yours too,
[1546.28 --> 1547.02]  and my meditations
[1547.02 --> 1548.24]  are not always life-giving.
[1548.46 --> 1549.34]  I have some thoughts
[1549.34 --> 1550.28]  that I'm not proud of.
[1551.06 --> 1551.66]  And too often,
[1551.76 --> 1553.00]  I forget I'm redeemed
[1553.00 --> 1554.50]  and in need of more redemption,
[1554.68 --> 1555.08]  more grace,
[1555.24 --> 1556.22]  and I'm out of step
[1556.22 --> 1557.08]  with my Maker.
[1557.36 --> 1557.80]  And again,
[1557.90 --> 1558.84]  I need to repent
[1558.84 --> 1559.74]  and I need to learn
[1559.74 --> 1560.66]  to walk and step
[1560.66 --> 1561.48]  with the power
[1561.48 --> 1562.20]  of the Holy Spirit
[1562.20 --> 1563.00]  so that the words
[1563.00 --> 1563.54]  of my mouth
[1563.54 --> 1564.22]  and the meditation
[1564.22 --> 1564.90]  of my heart
[1564.90 --> 1566.00]  will be acceptable
[1566.00 --> 1566.78]  and pleasing
[1566.78 --> 1568.80]  to my Creator,
[1569.18 --> 1569.72]  Redeemer.
[1573.04 --> 1574.40]  And then too,
[1574.90 --> 1577.22]  we can declare
[1577.22 --> 1579.52]  the glory of God,
[1580.52 --> 1581.86]  the one who brings us life.
[1583.26 --> 1583.98]  Let's pray.
[1586.48 --> 1587.24]  Father God,
[1587.32 --> 1588.18]  we come before you
[1588.18 --> 1589.28]  and we just praise you
[1589.28 --> 1591.04]  for all the beauty
[1591.04 --> 1592.00]  and all the wonder
[1592.00 --> 1592.88]  we see around us.
[1592.88 --> 1594.92]  We see your handiwork
[1594.92 --> 1595.60]  on display.
[1596.82 --> 1597.24]  But Lord,
[1597.48 --> 1598.84]  if we're honest,
[1599.08 --> 1600.70]  it's not enough
[1600.70 --> 1601.96]  because we need
[1601.96 --> 1603.36]  to know how life works.
[1603.50 --> 1604.64]  So you give us your law,
[1604.74 --> 1605.90]  you give us your words.
[1606.30 --> 1606.50]  Lord,
[1606.60 --> 1607.64]  may we be eager
[1607.64 --> 1609.48]  to understand those words
[1609.48 --> 1610.10]  and apply them
[1610.10 --> 1610.68]  to our lives.
[1612.36 --> 1612.72]  But Lord,
[1612.80 --> 1613.58]  may we also then
[1613.58 --> 1614.40]  even more so
[1614.40 --> 1615.12]  be honest
[1615.12 --> 1616.26]  when we fall short
[1616.26 --> 1617.42]  because we do.
[1618.50 --> 1619.82]  We need to keep striving,
[1619.92 --> 1621.04]  but we need to acknowledge
[1621.04 --> 1622.02]  we need a Redeemer.
[1622.88 --> 1624.10]  We need a Redeemer
[1624.10 --> 1625.74]  to pay our debts
[1625.74 --> 1626.74]  and free us from slavery.
[1627.14 --> 1627.64]  And then we need
[1627.64 --> 1628.68]  the power of your Spirit
[1628.68 --> 1629.58]  so that we can learn
[1629.58 --> 1630.82]  to walk in your ways.
[1631.20 --> 1631.78]  And then,
[1632.00 --> 1633.98]  we too will offer words
[1633.98 --> 1635.26]  of redemption
[1635.26 --> 1636.02]  and life
[1636.02 --> 1637.16]  to those around us
[1637.16 --> 1638.50]  because we can speak of you.
[1639.92 --> 1640.22]  So Lord,
[1640.28 --> 1641.16]  I pray that we may
[1641.16 --> 1642.10]  walk out of here
[1642.10 --> 1643.22]  intent
[1643.22 --> 1645.08]  on living out
[1645.08 --> 1645.94]  and living within
[1645.94 --> 1647.22]  the full revelation of you.
[1647.58 --> 1648.28]  In Jesus' name,
[1649.22 --> 1649.48]  Amen.
[1649.48 --> 1649.58]  Amen.
[1652.88 --> 1681.84]  Amen.
