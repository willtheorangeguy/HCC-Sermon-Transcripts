[0.00 → 13.66] Good morning. It's a privilege again to gather here and online and to be together in this
[13.66 → 21.64] time in the name of Jesus. What a wonderful blessing that is. I'm going to get into our
[21.64 → 27.20] passage this morning in a moment, but last week Dave mentioned that there was going to
[27.20 → 32.52] be an opportunity for people to send in questions as they read through the Gospel of John, and
[32.52 → 41.50] I get to answer the first question. I'm preaching in on the passage on water into wine, and this
[41.50 → 45.64] person asked a question in relation to that, and the question is, why are a lot of Christians
[45.64 → 56.68] against drinking when Jesus turned water into wine? I don't know. Not just that. I found
[56.68 → 60.92] a couple passages, and I thought it would be helpful. Ecclesiastes 9, 7 says,
[61.46 → 66.40] Go eat your bread with joy and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved
[66.40 → 76.46] what you do. I like that one. But Ephesians 5, 18 says, Do not get drunk on wine. This
[76.46 → 81.76] leads to wild living. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit. So I think the short of this
[81.76 → 88.32] is that the Bible isn't against drinking and the joy of an alcoholic beverage. It speaks
[88.32 → 95.20] against drunkenness and excess. Some Christians, I think, fear its dangers and I think overreact.
[96.32 → 100.46] Others, though, buy into a cultural narrative of what alcohol is about. It's about getting
[100.46 → 106.62] drunk, and that's wrong. And so I think there's that joy of enjoying God's goodness, the goodness
[106.62 → 114.74] of a glass of beer or a glass of wine, and celebrating life without getting drunk and using it in an
[114.74 → 119.30] irresponsible way. I think we see that in the use of all kinds of gifts that God gives us.
[119.46 → 126.04] Food, sex, there are problems when there's excess or abuse of a gift from God. And that's what
[126.04 → 131.30] the Scripture speaks again. So anyway, I hope that helps a little bit. There's my answer for
[131.30 → 140.24] now, and I'm sticking to it. Last week, Dave introduced this series on John's gospel, and
[140.24 → 145.78] I love how he started it with the analogy of fireworks and going to the Vancouver Fireworks
[145.78 → 152.04] Show. I thought I'd share a firework story, too, that I read. Actually, my wife shared it
[152.04 → 156.64] with me in a devotional. And let me read it to you. The writer says,
[156.64 → 161.50] The city where I live is known for the best fireworks on the planet. It's no secret, either.
[161.58 → 166.92] People from all over fly into San Diego to witness the spectacle. The city loads four barges
[166.92 → 171.70] down with munitions, parks them in different parts of the bay, then synchronizes the launch
[171.70 → 177.26] with music as hundreds of thousands of people assemble to watch hours of explosions. And that
[177.26 → 182.14] sounds pretty familiar, doesn't it? Thousands of fireworks are put on display. It's a pyromaniac's
[182.14 → 188.54] dream. And the question isn't whether the show will burn your retina just a little, but whether
[188.54 → 194.54] you'll get there early enough for a good parking space and a good seat. Again, sounds very familiar.
[194.54 → 200.14] One year, instead of a perfect symphony of pyrotechnics and patriotism over the course of an hour,
[200.14 → 206.68] someone made a mistake, hit the wrong button, and every single firework went off at once.
[206.68 → 212.54] It was over within 30 seconds. It was 9 o'clock at night, and suddenly the sky was as bright
[212.54 → 216.80] as noon, and for a brief moment as thousands of fireworks all exploded on the decks of all
[216.80 → 224.00] the barges at once. It was awesome. More than a few people in San Diego lost their eyebrows
[224.00 → 229.50] that night. The people with the best view were the dudes who pushed the button. Sure, they
[229.50 → 235.40] lost their job, but I bet they thought it was worth it. And I think that would be awesome.
[235.40 → 243.90] I would have really enjoyed that. John kind of, as Dave said last week, started his gospel
[243.90 → 249.76] like that, right? With all the fireworks right up front. In the beginning was the Word, and
[249.76 → 256.40] the Word was with God. Boom! The Word was God. Boom! The Word was God, and all things were
[256.40 → 260.40] created through Him. Boom! And the Word was made flesh and made His dwelling among us. Boom!
[260.40 → 266.60] Another one goes off. And John wants us to see that the Word, the Logos, Jesus, he wants
[266.60 → 273.02] us to see His spectacular glory. All that beautiful fireworks of Jesus lighting up the darkness.
[273.02 → 283.42] God is. That's how John starts. Now, Dave and John, that's two firework analogies, and I challenge
[283.42 → 288.58] you to do a firework analogy for every single part of this series. So, just kidding. I think
[288.58 → 299.52] that might get annoying after a while, but we can do it, yeah. I want you to look at John
[299.52 → 304.92] 20, verse 30 through 31. Dave shared that last week, but it's kind of the heart of John's
[304.92 → 310.80] gospel. Look at it with me. John 20, verse 30, 31. Jesus performed many other signs in
[310.80 → 315.78] the presence of His disciples, which are not recorded in this book. It would be so nice
[315.78 → 320.72] to see them all recorded, but these are written that you may believe. Oh, there we go. That
[320.72 → 324.66] Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and then by believing, you may have life in His name.
[324.66 → 329.70] And I love this thing of that, you know, we have these stories shared with us, and they're
[329.70 → 333.80] supposed to lead to belief, and then belief leads to change of life. And so, that's extremely
[333.80 → 340.78] important. If we take the incarnation seriously, that the Word became flesh, the rest of the
[340.78 → 345.42] gospel shows us what grace tastes like, and smells like, and sounds like, and feels like.
[346.06 → 350.56] That's what's going on here. Maybe you've never heard of this. I think most of you probably
[350.56 → 356.56] have, but we are in a season called epiphany. Epiphany is usually associated with the story
[356.56 → 363.76] of the wise men, which is often around January 6th, I think. We celebrate that the wise men
[363.76 → 368.86] came, right? I know that messes up our manger scenes, but the wise men came much later to
[368.86 → 377.20] a house. And so, epiphany is a season from the wise men to Lent, to the cross, the whole gospel.
[377.20 → 384.20] And a season where God shows Himself, and we realize He is with us in so many ways. And
[385.16 → 391.60] John and the gospel writers show some of those ways. And one of the ways that God displays
[391.60 → 397.20] who He is, is through the miracles, which John refers to as signs. He doesn't use the word
[397.20 → 401.90] miracles, he uses signs, because they point to something like a sign does. In John's gospels,
[401.90 → 407.36] there are seven signs. The water and the wine, cleansing of the temple, there's a couple
[407.36 → 412.86] of healings, the feeding of the 5,000, walking on the water, the sea, healing a blind man,
[412.86 → 418.74] and then raising Lazarus from the dead. So those are the signs that John shares with us.
[418.74 → 422.86] And again, remember there are so many things that don't get recorded, but what is written is
[422.86 → 430.28] there so that you'll believe in a life-changing way. In a life-changing way. And these signs
[430.28 → 436.62] point to something beyond themselves. They alert us to something that lies ahead, like signs
[436.62 → 444.24] do. Now, when we tend to think of miracles, we tend to think of miracles being those things
[444.24 → 448.62] that help people in desperate need. And we see healing, and we see the feeding and the raising
[448.62 → 455.12] of the dead. Relieving suffering. This first sign that we're going to read about seems by
[455.12 → 469.62] comparison frivolous. It doesn't seem particularly demanding in need of attention here. You know,
[469.62 → 475.26] in a way, you think about it, it says, oh no, we're short of wine, what are we going to do?
[475.26 → 481.84] You go, well, okay, I guess that's a problem. It's certainly a problem in a pandemic.
[485.60 → 491.26] You know, it doesn't feel like, you know, okay, this wedding is going to be a bit of a bust.
[492.30 → 497.10] The planners are going to suffer some embarrassment. But again, there's a lot more going on with
[497.10 → 503.66] the sign because Jesus enters real life and his miracle is changing water into wine. Now,
[504.20 → 507.60] let's read it together. John 2, the verses 1 through 11.
[507.60 → 518.58] On the third day, a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, and Jesus and his
[518.58 → 524.18] disciples had also been invited to this wedding. When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him,
[524.64 → 530.68] they have no more wine. Woman, why do you involve me? Jesus replied, my hour has not yet come.
[530.68 → 538.64] His mother said to the servants, do whatever he tells you. Nearby stood six stone water jars,
[538.90 → 545.32] the kind that the Jews used for their ceremonial washing, this cleansing aspect, each holding from
[545.32 → 552.38] 20 to 30 gallons, kind of, I don't know, the size of a good-sized garbage can. Jesus said to the servants,
[552.52 → 557.52] fill the jars with water, so they filled them to the brim. And then he told them, now draw some of the
[557.52 → 562.56] water out and take it to the master of the banquet. And they did so. And the master of the banquet tasted
[562.56 → 567.26] the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants
[567.26 → 572.06] who had drawn the water knew. And then he called the bridegroom aside and said, wow, everyone brings
[572.06 → 576.52] out the choice wine first, and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink.
[577.10 → 584.68] But you have saved the best till now. What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs
[584.68 → 590.16] to which he revealed his glory, and his disciples believed him.
[591.16 → 594.60] And there you see some of the nature of the sign there.
[595.24 → 599.80] The image of the wedding is used frequently in Scripture as a picture of restoration
[599.80 → 605.46] and, obviously, unity. And the wine is frequently used as a symbol of joy
[605.46 → 606.92] and celebration.
[608.92 → 611.06] Amos, in the Old Testament, writes,
[611.06 → 617.86] That's a lot of wine.
[618.66 → 621.82] There's a picture there of God's sharing abundantly.
[622.54 → 626.20] Isaiah, in the Old Testament, speaks of a feast that God will prepare for all the people.
[626.28 → 626.66] And he writes,
[626.98 → 633.82] You see the picture. These are snapshots of God's goodness.
[635.10 → 637.30] Abundance that comes from this God of life.
[637.30 → 640.02] And John says of Jesus,
[640.52 → 642.36] In him was life.
[642.50 → 644.72] That life was the light for all people.
[645.26 → 646.24] Abundant life.
[646.58 → 647.66] Life in all its fullness.
[648.12 → 651.50] Life that is so much more than just survival.
[651.82 → 654.28] So much more than just getting by.
[657.26 → 658.64] And John is saying,
[658.86 → 659.24] You know what?
[659.32 → 661.70] This kingdom that Jesus brings,
[662.14 → 664.16] it's like a village wedding.
[665.20 → 666.94] A village wedding celebration.
[666.94 → 668.40] And everyone's invited.
[668.60 → 670.40] And this party goes on and on and on.
[670.46 → 671.46] It goes on for a week,
[671.54 → 672.80] which was how they celebrated.
[673.32 → 674.26] It's a party.
[674.60 → 675.72] And those who were struggling,
[675.86 → 676.78] as these people were,
[677.04 → 678.00] struggling with poverty,
[678.16 → 679.66] struggling with Roman oppression,
[679.96 → 684.08] they get to celebrate that life is so much more than their brokenness.
[684.28 → 687.06] So much more than the struggles they face.
[687.28 → 690.28] There's so much more possibility yet to come.
[690.60 → 694.72] Because this party is a good sign of God's kingdom come and coming.
[694.72 → 699.52] In Revelation,
[700.18 → 702.74] John described the end victory of God this way.
[702.82 → 702.94] He said,
[703.04 → 707.64] Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.
[708.34 → 710.40] Even that last snapshot is a wedding.
[711.18 → 712.10] And we're all invited.
[713.00 → 713.70] So much life.
[713.82 → 714.66] So much abundance.
[714.88 → 715.78] So much celebration.
[716.46 → 716.76] You know what?
[716.86 → 718.88] And I thought about this a lot this week.
[718.88 → 724.18] Then I feel sad when religion or church are synonymous with boring and lifeless.
[727.88 → 729.20] The kingdom of God.
[729.34 → 730.02] Life with God.
[730.10 → 731.00] It's like a feast.
[731.20 → 732.08] It's like a party.
[732.54 → 734.30] And then like God said at the beginning,
[734.56 → 736.70] it's very, very good.
[736.70 → 736.80] God.
[740.48 → 741.96] Oh yeah, I believe.
[748.38 → 749.88] This is life changing.
[750.00 → 750.86] We've got to add that part.
[750.92 → 752.50] We don't just believe a bunch of statements.
[752.92 → 754.70] We believe, and it transforms life.
[754.98 → 756.46] And it shows abundant life.
[757.72 → 759.94] The church is called the bride of Christ.
[760.54 → 762.58] Christ is called the bridegroom.
[762.88 → 765.30] And we celebrate our union with Christ.
[765.30 → 765.38] Christ.
[766.42 → 769.60] We don't become boring old married people.
[772.82 → 774.18] We celebrate.
[777.18 → 779.38] Watched this movie a long time ago.
[780.62 → 784.04] A movie called Babette's Feast.
[785.40 → 790.48] And it won the Academy Award in 88 for Best Foreign Film.
[790.94 → 791.94] And the story is this.
[791.98 → 792.66] The story goes into this.
[792.66 → 798.42] In the late 19th century, there was a small fishing village in a dreary place on the coast of Denmark.
[799.52 → 801.24] And there are two sisters there.
[801.30 → 807.84] And they've given up their ambitions to care for their aging father, who's an elderly pastor in a stern church.
[807.84 → 822.76] And their band of dour Christians learned the meaning of God's extravagant grace from a most unlikely source when a French refugee named Babette invades their small world.
[822.76 → 830.76] And in a highly symbolic moment in the movie, Babette, who was a famous chef in Paris, cooks the villagers a sumptuous feast.
[831.26 → 837.02] And at first, these dour, pinched villagers can't allow themselves to enjoy the extravagance.
[837.48 → 843.40] But they loosen up, and they learn to accept celebration and excess and abundance.
[843.40 → 848.00] And somehow I see the church that way, right?
[848.90 → 852.58] Sometimes we've lost the capacity to celebrate.
[853.82 → 858.86] We've lost the capacity to realize the abundance that God spreads before us.
[858.86 → 869.30] And, you know, in our passage for today, Jesus' mother notices, you know, that there's a shortage of wine.
[871.70 → 874.78] And she brings it up to Jesus' attention.
[875.88 → 879.38] And, you know, I kind of laugh at it, right?
[879.54 → 883.36] Because Jesus basically says, it appears to have a problem and it's not mine.
[883.36 → 895.26] And I laugh at this because, first, and this is just me, a woman notices the problem way before any guy does.
[897.22 → 900.44] And that would be true in my life all the time.
[902.12 → 909.58] You know, I share something with my wife about a plan I have, and then she points out 15 things that I'm not even thinking about yet.
[909.58 → 913.28] And she kind of spoils my idea as far as I'm concerned.
[914.24 → 915.22] But she's right.
[915.40 → 919.18] All these things are going to be things that have to be dealt with.
[920.10 → 922.10] I think Dave says an amen to that too.
[923.68 → 927.46] I think a guy wouldn't have noticed a problem until he went to get a glass of wine and can't get one.
[928.10 → 930.04] I think that's probably the moment.
[930.82 → 934.00] But anyway, it's interesting to me that Mary then just goes to the servants.
[934.66 → 937.54] And she says, do what he tells you to do.
[937.54 → 938.54] Hmm.
[940.62 → 941.38] Isn't that interesting?
[941.50 → 943.48] She kind of seems to be in charge, I think.
[944.18 → 950.20] And I wonder, you know, I wonder, you know, you think of all these stories that don't get told that John references in John 20.
[950.42 → 961.18] I wonder that what had Jesus revealed to her up to this point that would cause her to believe that such an event of turning water into wine was even possible.
[961.18 → 963.18] Right?
[964.10 → 966.14] I mean, that she said, oh, I know what we can do.
[966.52 → 968.26] Jesus can just change the water into wine.
[968.96 → 970.84] You know, had he tried this out at home?
[973.34 → 975.80] You know, anyway, you know, it just amazes me.
[975.80 → 985.68] And Jesus then tells these servants, right, to fill these six stone pots or jars of water holders.
[986.96 → 989.28] You know, they held 20 to 30 gallons of water.
[989.42 → 990.36] A lot of water, right?
[990.94 → 992.72] A big amount of water here.
[993.32 → 994.96] And they fill it up to the brim.
[995.06 → 999.66] And then they get transformed into 150 to 180 gallons of the best wine.
[999.66 → 1003.10] Far beyond, far beyond what these parties needed.
[1005.32 → 1005.92] Abundance.
[1007.72 → 1008.36] Abundance.
[1010.86 → 1016.10] This water that was used for purification, cleaning up, but purifying yourself.
[1016.24 → 1019.84] A lot of Jewish rituals and customs that involve purification.
[1020.48 → 1027.84] This purification water is transformed into 180 gallons of, in a sense, of grace on a dying party.
[1029.66 → 1038.26] You know, in John 1, John uses the phrase, referring to Jesus as grace upon grace, right?
[1038.50 → 1042.38] Enough grace here for a whole city, a whole province, for the whole world.
[1042.68 → 1045.64] Grace right up to the rim and over the top, grace.
[1049.18 → 1050.36] Overflowing grace.
[1052.86 → 1056.26] Proverbs 3, I was thinking of this idea of overflowing.
[1056.72 → 1058.02] Proverbs 3, 9-10.
[1058.02 → 1058.94] Right?
[1059.06 → 1060.26] Honour the Lord with your wealth.
[1060.56 → 1062.80] And when the first fruits of all your crops.
[1063.28 → 1065.98] Then your barns will be filled to overflowing.
[1066.10 → 1068.32] Your vats will brim over with new wine.
[1072.70 → 1075.70] Sometimes, you know, I'm Dutch in background.
[1075.92 → 1080.04] So the thought of wine spilling over the top bothers me with that waste.
[1080.04 → 1084.02] But it's a picture.
[1085.42 → 1090.30] It's a picture of, you know, a God who is not stingy.
[1091.24 → 1093.92] A God who pours out blessing.
[1094.02 → 1095.04] It pours out blessing.
[1095.30 → 1096.32] And then it overflows.
[1096.52 → 1097.18] Why does it overflow?
[1097.42 → 1100.12] It overflows so it goes somewhere.
[1100.12 → 1100.40] There.
[1106.40 → 1111.26] A God who calls us from emptiness to access to overflowing.
[1112.46 → 1115.38] I was thinking of some other passages in Scripture would illustrate this a little bit more.
[1115.38 → 1116.82] In Deuteronomy 4, right?
[1116.90 → 1117.72] The time of Moses.
[1118.10 → 1119.64] There's a passage on tithing.
[1119.80 → 1122.48] Of giving of your resources back to God.
[1123.14 → 1124.92] And where you should then bring those offerings.
[1125.10 → 1129.24] And they give this location where they had to bring their offerings and their tithe.
[1129.64 → 1132.24] But for some, it wasn't possible to go there.
[1132.32 → 1133.30] It was too far away or whatever.
[1133.80 → 1134.46] And then they were told.
[1134.58 → 1135.64] I'm going to look at it with me.
[1136.42 → 1137.48] Deuteronomy 14.
[1137.48 → 1140.10] Look what they're told to do.
[1141.36 → 1142.30] Use the silver.
[1142.40 → 1143.26] So you couldn't bring it.
[1143.58 → 1146.74] Use the silver to buy whatever you like.
[1149.36 → 1152.60] Cattle, sheep, wine, or other fermented drink.
[1153.02 → 1154.00] Anything you wish.
[1155.56 → 1160.34] Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the Lord your God and rejoice.
[1161.72 → 1163.96] I couldn't bring my tithe.
[1163.96 → 1166.92] So God told me to have a party instead.
[1168.30 → 1170.20] That's what's going on.
[1173.70 → 1176.64] You know, I think of the people of Israel, right?
[1177.32 → 1181.04] You know, they get taken into exile because they're disobedient.
[1181.40 → 1182.88] So they lose Jerusalem.
[1183.08 → 1184.20] They lose everything.
[1184.32 → 1185.38] They lose the temple.
[1185.66 → 1187.22] They're taken into Babylon.
[1187.74 → 1190.10] And eventually, a remnant come back.
[1190.50 → 1191.28] And they come back.
[1191.36 → 1192.90] And this is what happens in Nehemiah 8.
[1192.92 → 1193.48] Look at it with me.
[1193.74 → 1196.20] They read from the book of the law of God.
[1196.20 → 1199.10] Because people hadn't remembered this stuff.
[1200.18 → 1203.88] Making it clear and giving the meaning up so that the people understood what was being read.
[1204.42 → 1210.60] And Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest, the teacher of the law, and the Levites, who were religious instructors,
[1210.92 → 1214.58] were instructing the people what was said to them all.
[1214.58 → 1217.04] This day is holy to the Lord.
[1217.44 → 1219.00] Do not mourn or weep.
[1220.80 → 1224.26] For all the people have been weeping as they listened to the word of the law.
[1224.40 → 1225.56] And you can see why.
[1225.94 → 1230.12] They lost everything they had because they didn't follow God's ways.
[1230.30 → 1231.26] And now they're back.
[1231.48 → 1234.26] And now they hear what life in God is like.
[1234.26 → 1236.20] And they realize they're far from that.
[1236.50 → 1237.70] And they're weeping.
[1240.74 → 1242.60] I'm not living like that.
[1243.22 → 1244.04] I'm a mess.
[1246.68 → 1247.68] Let's carry on.
[1248.46 → 1249.10] Nehemiah said,
[1249.24 → 1251.70] Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks.
[1251.98 → 1253.82] And send some to those who have nothing prepared.
[1254.18 → 1255.44] This day is holy to the Lord.
[1255.74 → 1256.32] Do not grieve.
[1256.38 → 1258.26] For the joy of the Lord is your strength.
[1260.68 → 1261.84] Do not grieve.
[1261.84 → 1262.24] Right?
[1262.56 → 1264.18] And the Levites calmed all the people.
[1264.56 → 1264.92] Saying,
[1265.18 → 1266.78] Be still for this is a holy day.
[1267.06 → 1267.86] Don't grieve.
[1269.42 → 1271.72] And then all the people went away to eat and drink.
[1271.78 → 1274.88] And to send portions of food to those who didn't have.
[1275.00 → 1276.32] And to celebrate with great joy.
[1276.42 → 1281.50] Because they now understood the words that had been made known to them.
[1281.84 → 1284.66] And the word Jesus wants you to know.
[1284.96 → 1285.74] He has come.
[1286.06 → 1287.92] Not to make you just feel crummy.
[1287.92 → 1290.10] But to make you live in joy.
[1291.84 → 1299.88] We have received abundant grace.
[1301.80 → 1302.80] Abundant grace.
[1303.76 → 1304.96] And yeah, okay, I get it.
[1305.30 → 1307.68] I've certainly grieved my sin sometime.
[1308.24 → 1310.78] But at some point, we have to drop the grief.
[1311.22 → 1314.46] And realize we're utterly washed clean in the blood of Christ.
[1314.46 → 1316.88] And we can live abundant life.
[1320.92 → 1322.16] Overflowing grace.
[1324.54 → 1327.60] One of my favourite passages on this is Psalm 23 verse 5.
[1328.46 → 1329.36] I've talked about it before.
[1329.66 → 1331.10] But it just hit me again.
[1331.58 → 1331.68] Right?
[1331.88 → 1332.86] You know, Psalm 23.
[1333.36 → 1334.00] The Lord is my shepherd.
[1334.10 → 1334.16] Right?
[1335.24 → 1336.20] There David writes,
[1336.30 → 1338.48] You prepare a table before me.
[1339.00 → 1339.92] So we're going to have a feast.
[1339.92 → 1340.96] The table before me.
[1340.96 → 1341.20] Where?
[1341.52 → 1342.98] In the presence of my enemies.
[1343.26 → 1344.84] You anoint my head with oil.
[1345.14 → 1346.06] My cup overflows.
[1346.30 → 1347.96] In the middle of the battle.
[1348.14 → 1349.56] In the middle of the struggle.
[1349.88 → 1351.92] There's celebration going on.
[1357.82 → 1359.30] A feast in the middle of it all.
[1359.30 → 1363.94] And John tells us that the first sign of Emmanuel, a God with us,
[1363.94 → 1365.96] isn't to call a sombre prayer meeting,
[1366.22 → 1367.80] but to empower a party.
[1370.66 → 1372.22] To empower a party.
[1374.32 → 1377.48] That is not how I grew up.
[1380.38 → 1384.12] Sombre was the tone we actually wanted.
[1386.02 → 1389.00] And again, I grew up in a wonderful church community.
[1389.58 → 1391.68] And, you know, learned my faith in that community.
[1392.16 → 1393.76] But celebration wasn't a big thing.
[1393.94 → 1398.22] And I, as I get older and older,
[1398.54 → 1402.92] I question, how does the church not celebrate more?
[1406.00 → 1408.62] You know, I picture those empty stone jars.
[1409.74 → 1411.06] They tell a story, don't they?
[1411.34 → 1414.44] This sort of, in a sense, this rote religion and ritual
[1414.44 → 1415.52] don't gladden the heart.
[1415.82 → 1417.38] We must celebrate.
[1418.90 → 1421.90] And he takes that water, and he turns it into wine.
[1423.94 → 1428.92] And we celebrate life and its fullness,
[1429.04 → 1431.02] even in challenging time, even during a pandemic,
[1431.28 → 1433.56] because Jesus has come and Jesus is with us.
[1435.44 → 1436.76] Just like those people, right?
[1436.84 → 1438.52] Romans, Rome still oppressed them.
[1438.52 → 1442.22] They were still being taxed.
[1443.60 → 1444.04] Unbelievable.
[1444.26 → 1445.04] They were still poor.
[1445.52 → 1449.12] But they celebrated somehow life and God and goodness.
[1451.30 → 1453.66] You know, and I was thinking about those empty containers
[1453.66 → 1456.80] and it made me think of Luke 5 where Jesus says,
[1456.80 → 1460.20] And no one pours new wine into old wineskins.
[1461.40 → 1463.70] Otherwise, the new wine will burst to skins, right?
[1463.96 → 1466.12] And the wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined.
[1466.50 → 1468.40] No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.
[1469.04 → 1471.88] And no one after drinking old wine wants to new for they say,
[1472.02 → 1472.68] well, the old is better.
[1472.68 → 1478.56] You know, Jesus is saying,
[1479.34 → 1482.40] I'm making everything new, including you.
[1483.02 → 1484.24] And you maybe are kind of,
[1484.36 → 1487.44] where are you an old wineskin that needs to be new somehow?
[1487.90 → 1491.22] Where is it in your life that some changes need to take place
[1491.22 → 1493.56] so you can take the fullness of God
[1493.56 → 1496.14] and somehow expand and not burst?
[1496.14 → 1506.02] It struck me that the bridegroom and the steward
[1506.02 → 1508.12] are amazed at this amazing new wine.
[1508.78 → 1511.68] And they never thank the one who gave the gift, Jesus,
[1511.82 → 1513.06] because they didn't even know.
[1514.56 → 1515.46] And who knows?
[1515.52 → 1516.10] It's the servants.
[1517.64 → 1520.78] The ones in the background who are aware of the miracle that took place.
[1521.04 → 1522.88] And, you know, they kind of moved these stone jars around.
[1523.04 → 1524.22] They brought the wine in.
[1524.22 → 1527.54] They knew it had been water just a while ago.
[1528.02 → 1530.16] And they probably never even got a taste of it.
[1530.66 → 1534.26] And they went home with a story of grace and abundance
[1534.26 → 1537.14] where a party was saved from ruin,
[1537.58 → 1540.86] a sign of so much more saving yet to come,
[1542.02 → 1545.16] so much more transformation yet to come.
[1546.54 → 1547.96] That's what it's pointing to.
[1548.76 → 1550.32] Where's that transformation going to come from?
[1550.32 → 1556.38] You know, maybe it struck you when Jesus said to his mom,
[1556.50 → 1557.76] Woman, why do you involve me?
[1557.84 → 1558.76] My hour has not yet come.
[1558.88 → 1559.32] You think, oof.
[1560.94 → 1563.48] If I called my mom woman, I'd need healing.
[1570.12 → 1571.46] It's a cultural thing there, too.
[1571.90 → 1574.14] One writer said you could replace it with a word like m'lady.
[1574.74 → 1575.38] I tried that.
[1575.98 → 1577.76] M'lady, m'lady, why are you?
[1577.76 → 1582.48] It sounds a lot better, even though it sounds weird to say m'lady.
[1583.98 → 1589.74] You know, Jesus' mother, who John doesn't name,
[1591.62 → 1592.32] he just doesn't.
[1592.44 → 1596.08] He does that with a number of other people, too, in the gospel.
[1596.50 → 1599.42] Jesus' mother appears twice in John's gospel.
[1599.42 → 1604.56] Here, at the wedding at Cana,
[1605.30 → 1608.04] and next time in chapter 19 at the foot of the cross,
[1608.58 → 1609.48] watching her son die.
[1611.70 → 1613.40] Jesus calls her woman there, too.
[1614.16 → 1615.38] You know, woman, behold your son.
[1615.48 → 1616.10] That was John.
[1617.36 → 1617.76] Woman.
[1618.10 → 1619.32] And he builds a new community.
[1619.32 → 1627.82] And John here connects the first sign with his last breath when his hour had come.
[1628.36 → 1633.42] And we are called to connect Jesus' gift of wine at the wedding to the gift of his life on the cross.
[1633.42 → 1641.22] For he is indeed, he is indeed the best wine.
[1642.50 → 1644.28] He truly is the life of the party.
[1646.04 → 1648.18] Notice how John started chapter 2.
[1648.32 → 1649.26] You can go back and look at it.
[1649.40 → 1651.78] The very first line in chapter 2 is,
[1652.14 → 1653.94] On the third day.
[1655.20 → 1656.70] You go, whoa, whoa, third day.
[1656.82 → 1657.92] That should ring a bell.
[1657.92 → 1660.48] On the third day after Jesus' death,
[1660.78 → 1663.44] God serves up the best wine of all, his son.
[1663.70 → 1665.00] And then we hear the words again.
[1665.40 → 1669.24] You, Lord, have kept the best wine until now.
[1673.62 → 1675.70] Celebration, joy, life.
[1676.90 → 1678.72] You've kept the best wine until now.
[1678.72 → 1690.52] I was an English major when I was in university.
[1691.74 → 1697.38] And read a Russian writer that some of you I'm sure have heard of, Dostoyevsky.
[1698.38 → 1701.44] He wrote a book called The Brothers Kalamazoo.
[1701.44 → 1707.32] And in that story, a man named Alexei Kalamazoo falls asleep
[1707.32 → 1710.42] and dreams about the wedding at Cana.
[1711.76 → 1715.52] For him, it was a dream of indescribable joy.
[1717.20 → 1719.88] And when he awakes, he does a curious thing.
[1720.82 → 1723.58] He throws himself face down onto the earth
[1723.58 → 1725.98] and embraces it with all his might,
[1726.64 → 1728.34] with tears flowing.
[1728.34 → 1737.06] The joy at the wedding feast of Cana
[1737.06 → 1740.04] demands a heartfelt response.
[1741.40 → 1743.06] When the wedding feast is over,
[1743.24 → 1746.18] Jesus sets his face toward Jerusalem
[1746.18 → 1749.28] and started out for the hour that had not yet come
[1749.28 → 1750.54] but was soon to come.
[1750.80 → 1753.90] The hour when he would embrace the whole world
[1753.90 → 1755.78] and hug the whole world
[1755.78 → 1758.52] and water it with his tears and his blood
[1758.52 → 1761.62] bringing life, life in all its fullness.
[1764.90 → 1767.98] And we praise his glorious and holy name.
[1769.10 → 1772.18] And then we too are called to respond.
[1773.46 → 1776.34] To respond to this abundant life
[1776.34 → 1778.70] by sharing that abundant life
[1778.70 → 1782.00] with those people in our lives and those around us.
[1782.96 → 1783.58] Let's pray.
[1783.58 → 1783.60] Let's pray.
[1783.60 → 1783.64] Let's pray.
[1785.78 → 1789.80] Lord God, we come before you
[1789.80 → 1791.08] and we thank you, Father,
[1791.24 → 1795.98] for being a God of such abundant grace and love.
[1797.10 → 1799.78] Lord, you pour out that love and grace on us.
[1799.96 → 1801.66] And Lord, to be honest with you,
[1801.74 → 1804.00] sometimes we don't even, we hardly notice.
[1805.14 → 1807.80] We get caught up in life and its problems
[1807.80 → 1808.46] and its struggles
[1808.46 → 1810.04] and those are real problems and real struggles.
[1810.04 → 1813.90] But then we forget that you prepare a table before us
[1813.90 → 1815.30] in the midst of it all.
[1816.32 → 1818.58] And in the midst of it all, you throw a party
[1818.58 → 1820.00] and you invite us to come
[1820.00 → 1822.66] and we get to celebrate your goodness and your grace.
[1822.96 → 1825.02] And we encourage each other and bless each other.
[1825.24 → 1827.12] Lord, in a sense, that's what this service should be about.
[1827.32 → 1828.78] We celebrate together.
[1830.38 → 1832.42] Lord, forgive us for being so dour sometimes.
[1832.42 → 1838.04] For being so lackadaisical about the abundant,
[1838.48 → 1840.30] overflowing love you give us.
[1841.74 → 1846.10] Lord, help us to open our hearts and minds and our lives up
[1846.10 → 1849.64] so that we might share that overflowing love with others as well.
[1850.62 → 1853.56] Thank you, Lord, for your amazing, amazing grace.
[1854.14 → 1855.88] In Jesus' name, amen.
[1855.88 → 1856.02] Amen.
[1856.16 → 1856.60] Amen.
[1856.60 → 1858.16] Amen.
[1858.16 → 1858.66] Amen.
[1858.66 → 1858.72] Amen.
[1858.72 → 1858.78] Amen.
[1858.78 → 1858.82] Amen.
