[0.54 → 3.28] I'll have to say before the service, I saw a number of new faces.
[3.58 → 4.80] I actually said the same thing last week.
[4.84 → 6.76] There are a number of new faces I'm seeing this morning
[6.76 → 8.80] and a number of faces I haven't seen in a long time.
[8.90 → 11.06] And to those of you who are coming back for the first time in the season,
[11.20 → 11.82] welcome back.
[12.28 → 14.02] The church is not just what happens up here.
[14.08 → 14.98] The church is the body.
[15.12 → 17.38] And it's just great to see a number of people in our church
[17.38 → 18.86] gathering with the rest of the body.
[18.98 → 19.54] And so welcome.
[20.44 → 21.62] And to those of you who sort of said,
[21.68 → 24.00] hey, I want to get up this morning and go to church for the first time,
[24.66 → 25.46] welcome to you too.
[25.50 → 26.52] We're so grateful you're here.
[26.52 → 28.48] And I hope you connect with people in this community
[28.48 → 30.98] and find this as your church family.
[32.48 → 34.42] We're going to continue our study in the book of John.
[34.62 → 36.06] And I hope you had a chance this week.
[36.12 → 38.38] I know a lot of us are reading along to read through John 6.
[38.88 → 40.88] I had one of those experiences this morning
[40.88 → 42.72] where my wife prayed through what I'm going to preach.
[42.78 → 44.80] So you've got the condensed version of the sermon already.
[46.14 → 48.56] So yeah, maybe you're going to wish that we just stopped there.
[48.68 → 49.98] But we're going to look at John 6.
[50.16 → 52.12] This is the story of Jesus feeding the 5,000.
[52.52 → 53.84] That laughter makes me nervous.
[55.26 → 56.44] Jesus feeding the 5,000.
[56.44 → 59.64] This is one of the few stories where all four gospel accounts,
[59.74 → 61.32] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, all tell.
[61.48 → 63.16] So this is clearly a story of significance.
[63.32 → 65.32] And if you have your Bible, turn with me to John 6.
[70.86 → 72.30] Sometime after this,
[72.44 → 75.06] Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee,
[75.18 → 76.50] that is the Sea of Tiberias.
[77.16 → 78.74] And a great crowd of people followed him
[78.74 → 81.32] because they saw the signs he had performed by healing the sick.
[81.96 → 83.46] And Jesus went up on a mountainside
[83.46 → 84.84] and sat down with his disciples.
[85.38 → 86.76] The Jewish Passover was near.
[87.94 → 91.36] When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming towards him,
[92.06 → 92.80] he said to Philip,
[93.04 → 95.10] where should we buy bread for these people to eat?
[96.10 → 97.70] He asked this only to test him,
[97.76 → 100.18] for he already had in mind what he was going to do.
[101.32 → 102.16] Philip answered him,
[102.26 → 104.76] it would take almost a year's wages to buy enough bread
[104.76 → 106.08] for each one to have a bite.
[107.30 → 110.30] Another disciple, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother,
[110.30 → 111.28] spoke up,
[112.02 → 113.86] here's a boy with five small barley loaves
[113.86 → 114.84] and two small fish.
[115.60 → 117.48] But how far will they go among so many?
[118.90 → 119.44] Jesus said,
[119.50 → 120.62] have the people sit down.
[121.64 → 123.20] There's plenty of grass in that place
[123.20 → 124.04] and they sat down.
[124.18 → 125.64] About 5,000 men were there.
[126.78 → 128.02] Jesus then took the loaves,
[128.46 → 129.06] gave thanks,
[129.28 → 131.00] and distributed to those who were seated
[131.00 → 132.42] as much as they wanted.
[133.10 → 134.48] He did the same with the fish.
[135.50 → 137.28] When it all had enough to eat,
[137.38 → 138.46] he said to his disciples,
[138.46 → 140.36] gather the pieces that are left over.
[140.46 → 141.52] Let nothing be wasted.
[142.32 → 143.24] So they gathered them
[143.24 → 144.52] and filled 12 baskets
[144.52 → 146.24] with the pieces of five barley loaves
[146.24 → 147.66] left over by those who had eaten.
[148.94 → 151.26] After the people saw the sign Jesus performed,
[151.40 → 152.20] they began to say,
[152.42 → 153.72] surely this is the prophet
[153.72 → 155.02] who is coming into the world.
[156.04 → 156.36] Jesus,
[156.86 → 158.10] knowing that they intended to come
[158.10 → 159.50] and make him king by force,
[160.02 → 162.50] withdrew again to the mountain by himself.
[162.50 → 168.58] I wouldn't describe myself
[168.58 → 169.96] as an art person.
[171.24 → 172.80] I don't think I have the eyes for it,
[172.84 → 174.08] and even my wife's family,
[174.24 → 176.12] they are far more artistically oriented than me.
[176.22 → 177.34] I realize I don't always know
[177.34 → 178.68] all the nuances and details
[178.68 → 180.18] and the intricacies of art,
[180.28 → 181.30] but I did have an experience
[181.30 → 182.32] like five years ago
[182.32 → 183.90] where I was scrolling Google images,
[184.20 → 185.72] and I found a piece of art
[185.72 → 187.66] that I fell in love with immediately.
[188.40 → 189.86] In fact, right after I found it,
[189.86 → 191.30] I started tracking down the artist,
[191.44 → 192.62] and I found his email address,
[192.88 → 194.88] and I fired him an email boldly saying,
[195.00 → 197.08] hey, is this piece of art still for sale?
[198.04 → 199.60] They got back to me two days later saying,
[199.70 → 202.36] no, this piece of art sold for a lot of money
[202.36 → 203.38] to somebody else.
[203.98 → 204.74] I'm so glad
[204.74 → 206.22] because I never could have purchased it
[206.22 → 207.22] if it were still for sale.
[208.00 → 208.58] But then I said,
[208.62 → 209.70] hey, well, is there a print?
[209.78 → 211.00] Can I get a print of this piece of art?
[211.08 → 211.98] And he said, absolutely.
[212.38 → 214.18] And so I got this piece of art,
[214.22 → 214.90] and I'll show it to you.
[215.12 → 215.88] If you've been in my office,
[215.94 → 216.80] you will have seen this.
[219.86 → 221.46] My biggest fear is dropping this,
[221.54 → 222.14] but it's just a print.
[222.24 → 222.78] It's not the original.
[224.66 → 226.54] This is by Eric Feather,
[227.24 → 229.18] and it's called Jesus Feeds 5000.
[229.64 → 230.64] And I don't know if we can zoom in.
[230.68 → 231.34] Wow, thank you, John.
[232.68 → 233.36] After the service,
[233.40 → 234.78] you can take a closer look at this piece,
[234.90 → 237.38] but this piece has grown on me over the years.
[237.42 → 239.06] And I think Eric Feather masterfully,
[239.14 → 240.48] I can't help but think he's a believer
[240.48 → 242.74] because he captures so many dimensions of John 6
[242.74 → 243.70] that are amazing.
[243.88 → 244.62] One is, obviously,
[244.76 → 246.36] you've just got the huge crowd of people.
[246.36 → 248.02] And interestingly to me,
[248.14 → 249.96] the crowd actually isn't noticing Jesus.
[250.10 → 251.26] They're just enjoying the food.
[251.84 → 252.98] They're enjoying his provision.
[253.68 → 254.60] Then you've got disciples,
[254.80 → 256.34] and I know I've sealed it better,
[256.48 → 258.02] but they're busy serving,
[258.14 → 258.50] and you've got,
[258.62 → 260.04] I happen to think this is Philip,
[260.12 → 262.14] who's just staring at what's going on
[262.14 → 263.14] in bewilderment.
[264.46 → 266.96] And then probably my favourite is this boy,
[267.58 → 269.68] who's got these five loaves and two fish,
[269.74 → 271.26] and he's just staring at Jesus.
[271.96 → 272.78] And out of Jesus,
[272.86 → 274.24] you can see this light just emanating.
[274.24 → 275.96] This is like the kingdom breaking in,
[276.04 → 277.20] a miracle taking place,
[277.26 → 278.26] a sign of his identity.
[278.68 → 280.76] This is a joyful moment of provision,
[282.06 → 283.36] the feeding of the 5,000.
[284.46 → 284.88] And again,
[285.02 → 286.24] if you want to see more closely,
[286.36 → 287.96] you can just come up after the service
[287.96 → 288.88] and take a look.
[288.96 → 290.04] Last time I brought an artifact,
[290.24 → 291.10] I had a number of kids.
[291.32 → 291.86] And so the kids,
[291.94 → 292.74] I want to say specifically,
[293.08 → 294.04] you are welcome to come up
[294.04 → 295.08] and take a look at that piece.
[296.38 → 298.72] Now, John 6 is a passage with lots of layers.
[298.86 → 299.38] I've already said,
[299.48 → 300.28] I think John,
[300.52 → 301.78] the gospel writer's a genius,
[301.98 → 303.54] and I think there are always a lot of layers
[303.54 → 304.50] to what he says.
[304.56 → 305.24] And in this passage,
[305.32 → 305.86] there are layers.
[306.56 → 307.14] On the one hand,
[307.16 → 308.62] you have Jesus doing this sign,
[308.76 → 310.08] this miracle of feeding the 5,000,
[310.18 → 311.58] which is revealing his identity.
[312.08 → 313.80] He's showing that he's not just another human.
[313.94 → 314.98] He's sent by God.
[315.06 → 316.34] He's the Messiah of the world,
[316.48 → 317.66] and he wants people to believe.
[318.74 → 319.96] Another layer of this story
[319.96 → 321.02] is Jesus' provision.
[321.72 → 323.46] Jesus sees the real human need
[323.46 → 325.22] of this crowd who's come to hear him speak,
[325.30 → 326.60] and he wants to feed them
[326.60 → 327.82] out of compassion
[327.82 → 329.86] that they receive nourishment.
[330.50 → 331.66] He wants to meet their needs.
[331.66 → 334.22] But there's still another layer,
[334.30 → 334.52] and actually,
[334.62 → 335.66] this is where I'm going to spend time
[335.66 → 336.46] opening up this morning,
[336.56 → 338.10] and that's discipleship.
[338.72 → 340.14] A striking feature of this passage
[340.14 → 342.00] is how much Jesus is dialoguing
[342.00 → 342.72] with his disciples,
[343.02 → 343.94] how much he's showing them
[343.94 → 344.56] about who he is,
[344.80 → 345.50] what's in front of them,
[345.54 → 346.74] how he can meet needs,
[346.76 → 348.10] and how he wants them involved
[348.10 → 349.44] in his ministry.
[350.10 → 351.40] He's going to give them a new vision
[351.40 → 352.26] for what's possible
[352.26 → 353.56] now that he's with them
[353.56 → 354.56] and the kingdom has come.
[354.56 → 358.48] Now, I can't preach on John 6,
[358.56 → 358.98] the first part,
[359.06 → 359.58] without mentioning
[359.58 → 360.50] at least the whole chapter.
[360.70 → 361.96] John 6, interestingly,
[362.38 → 364.04] starts with Jesus feeding bread
[364.04 → 366.38] to 5,000 men plus women and children,
[366.62 → 367.72] so thousands of people.
[368.24 → 369.42] And then just a few verses later,
[369.52 → 371.26] John shows that Jesus is teaching,
[371.50 → 372.54] and he says to the crowd,
[373.26 → 375.50] I am the bread of life.
[376.20 → 377.40] And there's a lot of discussion
[377.40 → 378.76] sort of how this all fits together,
[378.90 → 379.62] and there's a lot of people
[379.62 → 379.92] who say, hey,
[379.96 → 380.94] the centre of this passage
[380.94 → 381.86] is actually Jesus saying,
[381.94 → 382.74] I'm the bread of life.
[382.74 → 384.18] And this sort of feeding narrative
[384.18 → 385.28] is sort of a warm-up
[385.28 → 387.94] to that sort of Jesus identification
[387.94 → 389.34] as the spiritual saviour.
[389.78 → 391.06] Justin Curry, if you're watching,
[391.18 → 392.28] this is like his greatest fear
[392.28 → 393.24] that I fall off the stage.
[393.56 → 394.52] You now have justification.
[396.24 → 397.18] But there's some discussion,
[397.30 → 398.28] like what's the most important part,
[398.34 → 399.00] Jesus being the sort of
[399.00 → 400.08] the spiritual saviour
[400.08 → 401.66] or Jesus being the physical provider?
[401.80 → 403.64] And I say yes to both of those.
[404.54 → 405.84] Jesus is the spiritual saviour.
[405.94 → 406.76] He is the bread of life.
[406.82 → 408.12] He wants people to believe in him
[408.12 → 409.56] and find their life in him.
[409.70 → 411.50] And that same spiritual saviour
[411.50 → 413.70] is also a physical provider.
[414.48 → 415.62] And spiritual for Jesus
[415.62 → 417.16] is physical provision.
[418.20 → 419.54] I don't know what we mean by spiritual,
[419.68 → 421.04] but when Jesus talks about the kingdom,
[421.50 → 422.34] the kingdom of God,
[422.46 → 425.08] it's a kingdom where bellies are fed, right?
[425.66 → 426.34] And this is the passage
[426.34 → 427.14] where a very human,
[427.28 → 428.42] a very compassionate Jesus
[428.42 → 430.02] sees real needs,
[430.20 → 431.36] and as the saviour of the world,
[431.44 → 431.68] he says,
[431.76 → 433.44] I will fill your stomachs,
[433.54 → 435.44] and I will show my abundant provision
[435.44 → 437.00] for your hunger
[437.00 → 438.80] because I care for your hunger
[438.80 → 440.28] because I care about that
[440.28 → 440.96] as your saviour.
[442.08 → 442.88] And we've said before
[442.88 → 443.64] in our sermon series
[443.64 → 445.26] that whenever Jesus performs signs,
[445.34 → 446.26] whenever he does miracles,
[446.68 → 447.72] he's always showing us
[447.72 → 449.00] the way the world's supposed to be.
[449.56 → 450.84] And so when he feeds the 5,000,
[450.96 → 451.30] he's saying,
[451.54 → 452.76] people were not created for hunger,
[452.90 → 453.84] and when the kingdom comes
[453.84 → 454.34] in its fullness,
[454.46 → 455.24] when Jesus returns,
[455.52 → 458.00] there will be no hungry stomachs.
[458.54 → 459.36] One of my favourite images
[459.36 → 460.16] of Jesus returning
[460.16 → 461.80] is the banquet.
[462.62 → 464.12] The banquet of the lamb
[464.12 → 465.82] is the future of the world.
[467.46 → 468.72] And another piece of John 6
[468.72 → 469.26] as a whole
[469.26 → 470.68] that I just can't help but mention
[470.68 → 472.92] is that it starts with a crowd,
[473.50 → 474.40] but it moves to something
[474.40 → 475.00] very different.
[475.16 → 476.48] You know, people are flocking to Jesus,
[476.60 → 477.52] they want to hear him speak,
[477.56 → 478.32] and it's because
[478.32 → 479.72] he's been performing
[479.72 → 480.56] signs and wonders.
[480.68 → 481.90] He's been showing his power.
[481.98 → 483.24] He's been demonstrating the kingdom,
[483.42 → 485.12] and that always draws a crowd,
[485.22 → 486.00] like even today.
[486.62 → 487.44] I remember as a kid,
[487.52 → 488.36] there was a church in Toronto,
[488.36 → 489.40] about an hour when I lived,
[490.10 → 491.86] and it was a very charismatic church,
[491.96 → 493.58] and it was known for healings,
[493.58 → 494.50] it was known for miracles,
[494.74 → 495.50] and you can imagine
[495.50 → 496.38] when that church was planted,
[496.54 → 497.12] some of this happened,
[497.46 → 499.00] it just ballooned in attendance.
[499.16 → 500.92] It became very, very popular.
[501.06 → 501.56] It made the news.
[501.66 → 502.46] There are all sorts of, like,
[502.70 → 503.96] things happening around it.
[504.00 → 504.68] It drew the crowd.
[505.30 → 506.28] But here's what's fascinating
[506.28 → 507.08] about John 6.
[507.62 → 508.64] Starts with the crowd,
[509.04 → 510.84] and then as it goes on,
[511.18 → 511.82] it finishes,
[512.08 → 512.76] the end of John 6,
[512.80 → 513.64] with all sorts of people
[513.64 → 514.46] abandoning Jesus.
[515.94 → 516.60] That's because Jesus
[516.60 → 517.48] talked about his identity,
[517.48 → 517.96] he talked about
[517.96 → 518.76] what it means to follow him,
[518.80 → 519.94] he talked about sort of the demands
[519.94 → 521.14] and what it means to believe in him,
[521.18 → 521.62] and people are like,
[521.68 → 522.70] phew, I'm out.
[522.70 → 524.22] It starts with the crowd,
[524.40 → 526.16] and it moves to a dwindling number of people,
[526.28 → 527.46] and a lot of people saying,
[527.80 → 528.98] I'm out of this.
[530.06 → 531.08] As one writer put it,
[531.92 → 532.98] there's always going to be
[532.98 → 533.72] a crowd of people
[533.72 → 535.40] who want the miracles
[535.40 → 536.42] without the relationship,
[536.90 → 537.76] who want the gifts
[537.76 → 538.56] without the giver,
[538.64 → 539.92] who want sort of the signs
[539.92 → 540.36] and wonders,
[540.48 → 541.92] but no real commitment
[541.92 → 543.64] to this person that is Jesus.
[545.44 → 547.08] But when this crowd comes to Jesus,
[547.52 → 548.60] he moves up to the mountainside
[548.60 → 549.24] with his disciples,
[549.70 → 551.02] he sits down with his disciples,
[551.02 → 552.44] and my favourite part of the story,
[552.50 → 553.62] which my wife already prayed about,
[553.72 → 555.22] is the first thing Jesus does
[555.22 → 556.88] is he turns to Philip,
[557.02 → 557.48] and he says,
[557.58 → 559.22] Philip, what are we going to do here?
[559.84 → 560.78] Where are we going to buy all the bread
[560.78 → 562.24] to feed these thousands of people?
[562.80 → 564.46] And I can imagine Philip's anxiety
[564.46 → 566.24] just like going through the roof, right?
[566.94 → 568.30] And John gives us this like
[568.30 → 569.58] fascinating tidbit
[569.58 → 570.40] about Jesus' question.
[570.54 → 571.24] He says, you know,
[571.30 → 572.60] Jesus already knew what he's going to do.
[573.02 → 574.84] He's doing this to Philip as a test.
[575.88 → 577.60] He's sort of gauging the barometer
[577.60 → 578.90] of Philip's faith.
[579.32 → 579.86] He wants to know,
[579.94 → 580.70] where's Philip at?
[581.24 → 582.10] How does Philip think
[582.10 → 583.04] things are possible
[583.04 → 583.86] now that I'm here?
[584.34 → 585.24] And that word test,
[585.32 → 586.48] I've mentioned that John is a genius,
[587.00 → 587.94] it's sort of a link back
[587.94 → 588.70] to another test
[588.70 → 589.80] in the Old Testament story,
[589.88 → 591.00] a very specific test
[591.00 → 592.10] that God's people had.
[592.70 → 593.20] You'll remember
[593.20 → 594.08] in the book of Exodus,
[594.26 → 595.06] if you know the Old Testament,
[595.22 → 596.78] God rescues his people from slavery,
[597.22 → 598.44] he pulls them out of oppression,
[598.58 → 600.24] he brings them through the desert
[600.24 → 601.38] towards the promised land,
[601.42 → 602.16] and in that desert,
[602.66 → 604.44] we're told that God tests them.
[605.34 → 605.84] He wants to know,
[605.94 → 606.96] will you trust me?
[607.32 → 608.20] You've seen what I can do,
[608.26 → 609.06] you've seen my power,
[609.28 → 610.34] now it's a bit tough,
[610.42 → 611.20] are you going to trust
[611.20 → 612.28] that I will provide for you?
[612.80 → 613.16] And of course,
[613.22 → 614.94] Israel failed that test miserably.
[615.40 → 615.98] They whined,
[616.08 → 616.60] they complained,
[616.74 → 617.62] they grumbled to Moses,
[617.72 → 618.34] they told Moses
[618.34 → 619.72] it was better to die in Egypt
[619.72 → 620.66] than to be in the wilderness,
[621.06 → 621.70] they failed.
[622.26 → 623.26] And what did God do for them,
[623.32 → 623.64] by the way?
[624.88 → 626.54] Bread from heaven.
[627.60 → 628.16] Now Philip's
[628.16 → 629.40] in this exact same place,
[629.48 → 629.66] you know,
[629.74 → 631.08] he's seen Jesus do his stuff,
[631.34 → 631.94] he's with Jesus,
[632.02 → 632.90] and there's a huge need
[632.90 → 633.38] in front of him,
[633.38 → 634.38] all these hungry stomachs,
[635.22 → 636.34] and Philip is probably like,
[636.34 → 637.90] I don't know what to do with this.
[638.78 → 639.66] And I think what Jesus
[639.66 → 640.44] is hoping for,
[640.48 → 641.28] is he's hoping for Philip
[641.28 → 641.58] to say,
[641.64 → 642.18] you know what Jesus,
[642.46 → 643.54] this is impossible
[643.54 → 645.26] for us to meet the need for.
[646.02 → 646.98] But I've seen what you did
[646.98 → 647.42] in Cana,
[647.88 → 648.82] when you turned those jars
[648.82 → 649.78] of water into wine,
[649.98 → 650.82] I saw what you did
[650.82 → 651.74] at the gate to Jerusalem
[651.74 → 652.84] with a paraplegic man
[652.84 → 653.34] who you just said
[653.34 → 654.30] to stand up and walk,
[654.32 → 654.74] and he did.
[654.90 → 656.00] And I'm going to trust Jesus
[656.00 → 657.30] that you have
[657.30 → 658.28] what is necessary
[658.28 → 659.42] to meet the needs
[659.42 → 660.04] of this crowd.
[661.44 → 662.40] Now Philip doesn't do that.
[663.64 → 665.68] He is in pure pragmatic dread.
[666.36 → 666.76] He's like,
[666.92 → 668.50] it takes a whole year's wages,
[668.72 → 669.82] and even if a whole year's wages
[669.82 → 670.32] came in,
[670.54 → 671.12] everyone would get
[671.12 → 672.38] one single bite, right?
[672.92 → 674.06] Philip fails the test.
[674.42 → 675.56] And in comes Andrew,
[675.68 → 676.42] another disciple.
[676.88 → 677.82] And Andrew, I think,
[677.86 → 679.20] is in a slightly different place
[679.20 → 679.62] than Philip,
[679.92 → 680.86] but not much.
[681.32 → 682.32] Andrew sees this little boy,
[682.40 → 682.56] he's like,
[682.60 → 683.38] hey, here's a kid
[683.38 → 684.32] who's got a little tray
[684.32 → 685.74] of five loaves of bread
[685.74 → 686.50] and two fish.
[687.38 → 688.42] Maybe we can do something
[688.42 → 688.86] with that.
[689.30 → 690.18] And then, like Philip,
[690.24 → 690.46] he's like,
[690.50 → 690.96] but I don't know
[690.96 → 692.38] how this little piece of food here
[692.38 → 693.00] is going to feed
[693.00 → 693.72] this whole crowd.
[694.44 → 695.04] So you've got Philip
[695.04 → 696.10] with like no trust,
[696.16 → 696.74] and you've got Andrew
[696.74 → 698.18] with a tiny little shred
[698.18 → 698.72] of trust.
[699.38 → 700.02] And again,
[700.08 → 701.10] I just wish I could see
[701.10 → 701.80] Jesus' face
[701.80 → 702.96] as they're interacting
[702.96 → 703.64] with him about how
[703.64 → 704.38] to meet these needs.
[704.52 → 705.84] But whatever Jesus does,
[706.04 → 707.00] his next move is to say,
[707.08 → 707.26] okay,
[707.78 → 709.10] just sit the people down.
[710.12 → 711.22] That's something you can do.
[711.64 → 712.68] So the disciples sit
[712.68 → 714.26] all the people down
[714.26 → 714.82] in this crowd,
[714.94 → 716.46] and then Jesus gets to work.
[716.82 → 717.98] And I think what's so interesting
[717.98 → 718.72] about this story
[718.72 → 720.84] is how unmiraculously
[720.84 → 722.38] John tells the story
[722.38 → 723.56] of Jesus actually doing
[723.56 → 724.06] the miracle.
[724.94 → 726.42] All we read is,
[726.88 → 728.22] Jesus then took the loaves,
[729.10 → 729.88] he gave thanks,
[730.46 → 731.48] and he distributed it
[731.48 → 732.52] to those who were seated
[732.52 → 733.62] as much as they wanted.
[734.26 → 735.00] He did the same
[735.00 → 735.66] with the fish.
[736.92 → 737.80] There you have it.
[738.14 → 739.10] Feeding of the 5,000.
[740.08 → 741.74] One sentence about it.
[741.86 → 742.24] And if, you know,
[742.30 → 743.36] at least the curious person
[743.36 → 743.76] in me is like,
[743.76 → 744.58] John, could you give us
[744.58 → 745.06] a little bit
[745.06 → 746.00] about how this happened?
[746.44 → 747.88] Like, how did the bread replicate?
[748.10 → 749.38] How do fish even look
[749.38 → 750.00] when they replicate?
[750.18 → 751.10] Did it happen from Jesus?
[751.20 → 752.28] Did it happen with the disciples?
[752.52 → 753.60] Or as the people received it,
[753.62 → 754.94] we have no idea.
[756.04 → 757.26] And I think one writer
[757.26 → 758.36] has his finger on the pulse
[758.36 → 758.90] when he says,
[759.02 → 759.74] the difficult thing
[759.74 → 760.40] about miracles
[760.40 → 762.26] is that they are difficult
[762.26 → 763.40] to describe.
[764.54 → 765.64] I remember hearing a story
[765.64 → 766.84] of a South African man
[766.84 → 767.70] who had his knee healed.
[768.20 → 769.20] Every time he told people
[769.20 → 770.54] how his knee was miraculously healed,
[770.60 → 771.06] it was shattered
[771.06 → 771.82] in a car accident,
[771.82 → 772.28] and he says,
[772.32 → 773.12] I don't know how to say it,
[773.50 → 775.30] but the knee came back together.
[776.24 → 777.94] That's how miracles go sometimes.
[781.38 → 782.50] John hastens to add
[782.50 → 783.82] a loving detail again
[783.82 → 784.34] where he says,
[784.42 → 784.54] you know,
[784.58 → 784.96] and by the way,
[785.02 → 785.70] this wasn't just everyone
[785.70 → 786.24] getting a bite.
[786.36 → 787.26] There were 12 baskets
[787.26 → 788.06] of food left over.
[788.52 → 789.22] It wasn't just Jesus
[789.22 → 789.90] showing up with
[789.90 → 790.92] a little bit of provision.
[791.04 → 791.82] It was Jesus showing up
[791.82 → 794.08] with abundant kingdom provision.
[794.56 → 795.32] And I can just imagine
[795.32 → 796.24] the disciples looking at
[796.24 → 797.62] those 12 baskets left over
[797.62 → 798.06] and saying,
[799.00 → 799.38] whoa.
[800.96 → 801.70] Wow, Jesus,
[802.12 → 803.00] you did it again.
[804.90 → 806.42] Now, what I want to hone in on,
[806.48 → 806.62] though,
[806.66 → 807.70] for the next few minutes
[807.70 → 809.14] is this element
[809.14 → 810.00] of discipleship.
[810.46 → 811.24] I'm struck by how
[811.24 → 812.40] all four gospel writers
[812.40 → 813.06] tell the story
[813.06 → 814.18] of Jesus feeding the 5,000,
[814.26 → 815.34] and they all pull out
[815.34 → 815.90] different details.
[816.06 → 817.22] Mark actually points out
[817.22 → 818.36] the compassion of Jesus.
[818.80 → 818.98] It says,
[819.08 → 820.02] Jesus looked at the crowd
[820.02 → 821.78] and he had compassion on them.
[822.28 → 823.48] This sort of deep pain
[823.48 → 824.08] in his guts
[824.08 → 825.70] to sort of feed these people
[825.70 → 826.32] who are hungry,
[826.74 → 827.84] who want to hear good news.
[828.22 → 829.00] But John,
[829.38 → 829.74] interestingly,
[829.98 → 830.98] not unlike Matthew,
[831.36 → 832.56] he really focuses in
[832.56 → 833.48] on the conversation
[833.48 → 834.78] between Jesus
[834.78 → 835.46] and his disciples.
[835.56 → 835.80] In fact,
[835.98 → 837.18] if you pay close attention,
[838.36 → 839.26] John spends more time
[839.26 → 840.26] talking about the conversation
[840.26 → 841.96] between Philip and Andrew
[841.96 → 842.84] and their activity
[842.84 → 844.30] than the miracle itself.
[844.80 → 845.42] Think about that.
[845.86 → 846.82] He gives more attention
[846.82 → 847.60] to what people are saying
[847.60 → 848.40] around the miracle
[848.40 → 849.86] than what actually happens
[849.86 → 850.96] when Jesus separates
[850.96 → 852.10] the loaves and the fish
[852.10 → 853.78] and feeds this massive crowd.
[854.50 → 854.98] And that, to me,
[855.00 → 855.58] is an indication
[855.58 → 857.22] of where John cares.
[858.74 → 860.22] This is all about discipleship.
[861.16 → 862.26] Before Jesus does anything,
[862.36 → 862.98] he asks Philip,
[863.08 → 863.46] hey, Philip,
[863.50 → 863.78] what do you think
[863.78 → 864.26] we're going to do?
[864.90 → 865.56] Then he's like,
[865.60 → 866.02] okay, Andrew,
[866.08 → 867.02] what's your solution to it?
[867.04 → 867.56] And Andrew points
[867.56 → 868.14] to this little boy.
[868.22 → 869.24] And even when they don't have
[869.24 → 870.64] any real plan for the activity,
[870.74 → 871.00] Jesus is like,
[871.06 → 872.10] okay, you distribute,
[872.28 → 872.76] you collect,
[872.84 → 873.60] you sit the people down,
[873.66 → 874.26] you get involved.
[874.60 → 876.28] Jesus is not a lone ranger
[876.28 → 877.30] disciple.
[878.02 → 879.02] He's not a lone ranger
[879.02 → 879.72] miracle worker.
[879.82 → 880.10] In fact,
[880.18 → 881.68] so much of what he does
[881.68 → 882.94] that we often miss
[882.94 → 883.86] when we read the story
[883.86 → 885.52] is pull in his disciples
[885.52 → 885.96] and say,
[886.04 → 886.88] let's do this together.
[887.58 → 888.74] I want you to figure out
[888.74 → 890.02] what's now possible
[890.02 → 892.26] now that the kingdom has come.
[892.50 → 894.06] I want to shape your vision
[894.06 → 895.38] for what you can do
[895.38 → 896.22] and what I will do
[896.22 → 897.22] through you
[897.22 → 899.06] now that I have come,
[899.44 → 900.76] now that I am at work,
[900.86 → 901.40] now that there are
[901.40 → 902.18] new possibilities
[902.18 → 903.58] because the kingdom of God
[903.58 → 904.40] has come near,
[904.92 → 906.32] as Jesus himself puts it.
[907.04 → 908.66] He's shaping their vision.
[908.66 → 912.84] Now, I want to highlight
[912.84 → 914.60] a quote that I read this week
[914.60 → 915.44] by A.W. Tower.
[915.52 → 916.64] And I think A.W. Tower
[916.64 → 917.66] just nails what I think
[917.66 → 918.60] a big piece of this passage
[918.60 → 919.00] is about.
[919.10 → 919.78] So this quote should be
[919.78 → 920.28] on the screen.
[920.80 → 921.38] And he writes,
[921.94 → 923.14] God is looking
[923.14 → 924.72] for those with whom
[924.72 → 926.82] he can do the impossible.
[927.86 → 928.66] What a pity
[928.66 → 930.04] we plan only the things
[930.04 → 931.12] we can do by ourselves.
[932.34 → 932.82] I'm just going to read
[932.82 → 933.34] that one more time.
[933.42 → 934.60] God is looking for the people
[934.60 → 935.70] through whom he can do
[935.70 → 936.26] the impossible.
[936.48 → 937.08] What a pity
[937.08 → 938.52] we plan only the things
[938.52 → 940.46] we can do by ourselves.
[941.48 → 941.98] Now, I don't know
[941.98 → 942.82] how that quote hits you,
[943.46 → 944.56] but it convicts me.
[945.34 → 946.14] And it makes me think,
[946.68 → 947.68] do I really believe
[947.68 → 948.14] that there are
[948.14 → 949.00] new possibilities
[949.00 → 949.96] in our church,
[950.16 → 950.84] in my life,
[950.92 → 951.52] in my family,
[951.66 → 952.12] in our city,
[952.18 → 953.46] now that Jesus has come,
[953.64 → 954.30] conquered death,
[954.62 → 955.74] poured out his spirit,
[956.12 → 957.18] and sent the church?
[957.34 → 958.12] Do I really believe
[958.12 → 959.22] that new things are possible?
[959.44 → 960.20] Or do I live with
[960.20 → 961.50] a sort of limited view
[961.50 → 961.96] of Jesus?
[963.10 → 963.78] A sense of like,
[963.84 → 964.84] what's a scarcity
[964.84 → 965.80] of God's provision?
[965.80 → 967.20] Do I have a sense
[967.20 → 967.76] of his abundance?
[969.02 → 969.54] And a statement
[969.54 → 970.24] that sticks with me
[970.24 → 971.10] about my own life
[971.10 → 972.58] a number of years ago
[972.58 → 974.22] comes from an African pastor
[974.22 → 975.10] named Pastor Abraham.
[976.06 → 977.26] He used to come to our church
[977.26 → 977.76] and spend time
[977.76 → 978.30] with our youth group
[978.30 → 979.10] when I was a youth pastor.
[979.58 → 980.74] And he was so generous
[980.74 → 981.44] and so kind,
[981.54 → 982.86] a man of deep prayer.
[983.24 → 984.04] And he said to me,
[984.06 → 984.80] and he actually meant this
[984.80 → 985.56] about the whole church,
[985.64 → 985.98] but he said,
[986.04 → 986.94] you pray so small.
[988.22 → 989.60] You pray so small.
[990.24 → 990.68] And it was,
[990.76 → 990.92] you know,
[990.94 → 991.38] a challenge,
[991.46 → 992.08] but it's like challenging,
[992.28 → 992.48] you know,
[992.60 → 992.98] it's true.
[993.52 → 993.78] You know,
[993.78 → 994.48] there's a sense in which
[994.48 → 995.42] we pray for what we think
[995.42 → 996.14] can actually happen.
[996.26 → 997.70] We're scared to pray big prayers.
[997.82 → 998.94] We're scared to pray for conversion.
[999.20 → 999.86] We have a sense of like,
[999.88 → 1000.72] I don't want to pray for stuff
[1000.72 → 1001.98] that might not actually happen.
[1002.08 → 1003.24] And so we just don't pray for much
[1003.24 → 1004.10] or we don't pray.
[1004.78 → 1005.76] Your prayers are small.
[1006.60 → 1007.96] And John really wants us
[1007.96 → 1008.80] to see these disciples
[1008.80 → 1010.86] grappling with living by faith,
[1011.70 → 1012.90] being willing to step out
[1012.90 → 1013.60] and do something
[1013.60 → 1014.04] and trust that,
[1014.12 → 1014.24] hey,
[1014.58 → 1016.16] that's not possible without God,
[1016.20 → 1016.70] but with God,
[1016.76 → 1017.50] it is possible.
[1018.14 → 1019.06] He wants disciples to say,
[1019.12 → 1019.18] hey,
[1019.22 → 1020.22] this is impossible without Jesus,
[1020.36 → 1021.82] but Jesus rose from the dead.
[1021.82 → 1023.50] And so now there are new possibilities
[1023.50 → 1024.38] in our lives,
[1024.76 → 1025.46] in our cities,
[1025.78 → 1026.56] in our churches,
[1027.62 → 1028.64] and it's no longer time
[1028.64 → 1030.52] to live with small prayer
[1030.52 → 1032.14] and small faith.
[1034.74 → 1035.58] In your small groups,
[1035.66 → 1036.62] I want you to do this,
[1037.06 → 1037.86] but I'll ask you now
[1037.86 → 1038.94] just to sort of percolate
[1038.94 → 1039.52] the mind.
[1039.64 → 1040.60] If you were to place yourself
[1040.60 → 1041.24] in this story,
[1042.26 → 1042.98] who would you be?
[1044.22 → 1044.98] If you were to place yourself
[1044.98 → 1045.32] in this story,
[1045.40 → 1046.34] Jesus feeding the 5,000,
[1046.40 → 1046.84] who would you be?
[1046.94 → 1048.16] I'd like to think,
[1049.16 → 1050.10] I'm Andrew.
[1050.10 → 1050.26] Right?
[1051.88 → 1052.62] I don't know how we're
[1052.62 → 1053.08] going to solve this,
[1053.14 → 1053.78] but here's a boy,
[1053.96 → 1054.88] he's got two fish,
[1054.96 → 1055.56] five loaves.
[1055.90 → 1057.14] But I often think,
[1057.52 → 1058.82] like in the ordinary
[1058.82 → 1060.72] ebb and flow of life,
[1060.82 → 1061.48] I think I'm probably
[1061.48 → 1062.10] more like Philip.
[1062.62 → 1062.86] It's like,
[1062.90 → 1063.16] you know what,
[1063.20 → 1063.54] this one,
[1063.74 → 1064.74] this is not going to happen.
[1065.40 → 1066.74] The resources are too scarce,
[1067.10 → 1068.16] the need is too great,
[1068.26 → 1069.26] we don't have what it takes,
[1069.32 → 1071.22] this is way too much work,
[1071.50 → 1072.78] this is just not going to happen.
[1072.84 → 1073.58] We have that sense of like
[1073.58 → 1075.16] this default towards doubt.
[1076.04 → 1077.02] This default towards
[1077.02 → 1077.80] sort of the barriers,
[1077.94 → 1078.60] the obstacles,
[1078.60 → 1080.22] what we cannot accomplish,
[1080.28 → 1080.52] and we say,
[1080.58 → 1080.62] hey,
[1080.64 → 1081.70] let's just shut this sucker down,
[1081.90 → 1082.80] it's not possible.
[1083.76 → 1084.88] We shouldn't try it.
[1086.60 → 1087.14] N.T. Wright,
[1087.26 → 1088.40] in his work on this story,
[1088.48 → 1089.06] he writes this,
[1089.08 → 1090.30] and I really love this quote,
[1090.38 → 1090.96] I want you to hear it
[1090.96 → 1091.40] for all it's worth.
[1091.46 → 1091.68] He says,
[1091.76 → 1093.42] our resources will seem
[1093.42 → 1095.92] and feel totally inadequate,
[1096.28 → 1097.54] and that's Jesus' problem.
[1098.92 → 1099.34] Hear that?
[1099.40 → 1100.62] Our resources will feel
[1100.62 → 1101.62] and seem totally inadequate,
[1101.74 → 1103.04] and that is Jesus' problem.
[1103.04 → 1104.92] Our task is not to bemoan
[1104.92 → 1106.16] how few loaves and fish
[1106.16 → 1107.12] we have for the crowd,
[1107.28 → 1108.54] but to offer them to Jesus
[1108.54 → 1110.56] and do whatever he wants with them
[1110.56 → 1112.42] and be ready to distribute them
[1112.42 → 1113.78] to our own surprise
[1113.78 → 1115.08] at his command.
[1116.98 → 1117.92] In this story,
[1118.04 → 1119.62] Jesus knows the need.
[1119.74 → 1120.62] This is a really important detail.
[1120.70 → 1121.80] Jesus sees the crowd
[1121.80 → 1122.76] just like Philip does,
[1122.86 → 1123.54] just like Andrew does,
[1123.60 → 1124.34] just like the disciples.
[1124.60 → 1125.64] He knows the need,
[1125.84 → 1126.92] and he also knows
[1126.92 → 1128.08] the anxiety
[1128.08 → 1129.22] and the fear
[1129.22 → 1130.16] and the worry
[1130.16 → 1131.06] in his disciples
[1131.06 → 1132.76] who know they can't meet the need.
[1132.76 → 1135.42] And Jesus wants his disciples
[1135.42 → 1136.62] to see full display
[1136.62 → 1137.92] of his provision.
[1138.78 → 1139.90] He wants them to look
[1139.90 → 1140.54] just like Philip
[1140.54 → 1141.36] in that piece of art
[1141.36 → 1141.96] and say,
[1142.82 → 1143.36] wow,
[1143.80 → 1145.34] all we're doing
[1145.34 → 1146.62] is bringing baskets of food,
[1146.94 → 1148.12] and Jesus is providing
[1148.12 → 1148.74] the miracle.
[1149.70 → 1151.30] Look at the abundant provision
[1151.30 → 1152.08] he can provide.
[1153.46 → 1154.12] Now here's what I want
[1154.12 → 1154.72] to just pause
[1154.72 → 1155.26] and make us think
[1155.26 → 1156.06] about our own lives.
[1156.40 → 1157.16] I've been a pastor here
[1157.16 → 1157.80] long enough to know
[1157.80 → 1158.98] that a lot of us
[1158.98 → 1160.06] have and have shared
[1160.06 → 1160.72] even with me
[1160.72 → 1162.52] stories of abundant provision.
[1163.32 → 1163.50] You know,
[1163.56 → 1164.58] one area that I've heard
[1164.58 → 1165.54] from a number of us
[1165.54 → 1166.10] in a number
[1166.10 → 1166.96] of different circumstances
[1166.96 → 1168.56] is God's abundant provision
[1168.56 → 1169.18] with employment.
[1170.06 → 1170.64] A number of you
[1170.64 → 1171.34] have shared with me
[1171.34 → 1172.46] that you've gone through seasons
[1172.46 → 1175.30] of very challenging work lives,
[1175.34 → 1176.44] or you've been let go of work
[1176.44 → 1177.18] for whatever reason,
[1177.60 → 1178.88] and you've got serious concern
[1178.88 → 1179.46] about taking care
[1179.46 → 1179.98] of your family,
[1180.12 → 1180.74] paying the mortgage,
[1180.86 → 1181.76] taking care of your kids,
[1182.06 → 1183.32] and so we move into prayer,
[1183.88 → 1184.78] and we ask for God
[1184.78 → 1185.70] to do what God does,
[1185.72 → 1186.44] and he does.
[1187.34 → 1187.96] And you sort of say,
[1188.04 → 1188.68] wow, look at that.
[1188.80 → 1189.82] At that moment of need,
[1189.82 → 1191.64] God legitimately showed up
[1191.64 → 1192.78] in power and in love
[1192.78 → 1193.38] and provided me
[1193.38 → 1193.90] with employment
[1193.90 → 1195.12] to care for my family
[1195.12 → 1195.86] and use my gifts.
[1196.26 → 1196.82] Praise the Lord.
[1198.08 → 1198.72] Others of you
[1198.72 → 1199.42] have shared stories
[1199.42 → 1200.96] of a serious health diagnosis.
[1202.50 → 1203.16] Serious news
[1203.16 → 1203.86] comes from a doctor
[1203.86 → 1204.70] that looks bleak,
[1205.38 → 1206.02] and you're now
[1206.02 → 1208.04] way beyond your own skills
[1208.04 → 1209.08] to solve your problem.
[1209.14 → 1209.62] You're way beyond
[1209.62 → 1210.78] your own scope of ability,
[1210.98 → 1211.74] and you're now just saying,
[1211.82 → 1212.46] okay, we've got to pray.
[1212.98 → 1213.76] And so we pray,
[1213.88 → 1214.54] and God shows up
[1214.54 → 1215.14] in all sorts of ways,
[1215.20 → 1216.08] sometimes in really
[1216.08 → 1217.40] ordinary God ways
[1217.40 → 1218.64] like good doctors,
[1219.28 → 1220.50] good access to care,
[1220.82 → 1222.06] a really quick timeline
[1222.06 → 1222.76] in terms of getting
[1222.76 → 1223.76] the surgery you need,
[1223.84 → 1225.20] and the care of family,
[1225.34 → 1226.28] child care from friends,
[1226.48 → 1227.72] a meal train from the church,
[1228.22 → 1230.72] and sometimes
[1230.72 → 1231.88] miraculous healing.
[1233.02 → 1233.62] There's some of you
[1233.62 → 1234.14] who know this.
[1234.22 → 1235.40] You prayed for God
[1235.40 → 1235.88] to intervene,
[1235.96 → 1236.86] and God showed up,
[1236.88 → 1237.80] and you stand back,
[1237.84 → 1238.88] and you simply say,
[1239.46 → 1240.20] praise the Lord.
[1240.94 → 1241.70] Your provision
[1241.70 → 1243.14] is abundant.
[1243.14 → 1245.66] And if I could tell you
[1245.66 → 1246.18] how to have your
[1246.18 → 1247.12] lunchtime conversation
[1247.12 → 1248.38] or your pre-Super Bowl
[1248.38 → 1249.04] conversation,
[1249.98 → 1251.34] I would say tell stories
[1251.34 → 1252.06] of how you have
[1252.06 → 1252.88] in your own life
[1252.88 → 1253.72] experienced the abundant
[1253.72 → 1254.38] provision of God
[1254.38 → 1255.08] because it's come,
[1256.16 → 1256.98] and those stories
[1256.98 → 1257.66] need to be told.
[1258.42 → 1258.96] There are a few times
[1258.96 → 1259.66] even in our own family
[1259.66 → 1260.08] where our kids
[1260.08 → 1260.74] are asking questions
[1260.74 → 1261.26] about miracles,
[1261.46 → 1262.62] and Levi turned to me
[1262.62 → 1262.78] and said,
[1262.86 → 1263.28] okay, how have you
[1263.28 → 1263.90] experienced this?
[1263.92 → 1264.58] What have you seen?
[1264.62 → 1264.98] And we'll say,
[1265.04 → 1265.76] okay, here's how
[1265.76 → 1266.36] we've seen it.
[1266.76 → 1267.48] Take the time.
[1268.20 → 1269.20] Think back over your life.
[1269.48 → 1270.36] How have you seen
[1270.36 → 1271.00] the abundant,
[1271.42 → 1271.96] miraculous,
[1272.30 → 1272.88] amazing,
[1272.88 → 1274.40] provision of Jesus Christ
[1274.40 → 1276.26] who knows your needs
[1276.26 → 1277.38] and knows your challenges
[1277.38 → 1278.56] showing up?
[1280.64 → 1281.46] Now, I've got this
[1281.46 → 1282.52] pastoral flinch
[1282.52 → 1283.46] whenever I preach
[1283.46 → 1284.68] on miracle accounts
[1284.68 → 1287.62] to avoid these extremes.
[1288.02 → 1288.68] And here are the extremes
[1288.68 → 1289.26] that come to mind.
[1289.38 → 1290.74] One extreme is sort of
[1290.74 → 1291.76] the Philip approach
[1291.76 → 1292.28] or I would call
[1292.28 → 1293.32] the Before approach
[1293.32 → 1293.84] to God,
[1294.22 → 1294.82] which is like
[1294.82 → 1295.74] nothing can be done,
[1295.88 → 1296.86] the needs are too great,
[1297.00 → 1297.80] we don't have the gifts,
[1297.88 → 1298.70] we don't get the skills,
[1298.92 → 1299.92] this is impossible.
[1300.30 → 1300.96] It's like you just,
[1301.12 → 1301.76] you shut down.
[1301.76 → 1302.80] The other extreme,
[1302.94 → 1303.60] equally dangerous,
[1303.74 → 1304.86] is I don't know
[1304.86 → 1305.86] how to describe it exactly,
[1306.00 → 1306.42] but it's sort of
[1306.42 → 1307.76] the name it and claim it.
[1307.84 → 1308.84] Like God's going to bless me,
[1308.92 → 1309.68] he's going to make my life easy,
[1309.76 → 1310.14] he's going to do all
[1310.14 → 1310.86] the healing I want,
[1310.92 → 1311.68] he's going to make it easy,
[1311.80 → 1312.60] he's going to give me the money,
[1312.68 → 1313.88] he's going to make me healthy,
[1314.16 → 1315.20] everything's going to be great.
[1316.00 → 1316.88] And I think that can be
[1316.88 → 1318.20] a very dangerous
[1318.20 → 1320.58] approach to God
[1320.58 → 1321.20] and miracles.
[1322.48 → 1323.26] And I think a lot of people
[1323.26 → 1323.94] have even been hurt,
[1324.12 → 1324.26] you know,
[1324.28 → 1324.52] it's like,
[1324.60 → 1325.36] does God love me?
[1325.40 → 1325.90] I'm not healed.
[1326.74 → 1327.58] And I want to highlight
[1327.58 → 1328.50] a detail in this story
[1328.50 → 1329.36] that matters a lot to me
[1329.36 → 1330.06] is that the disciples
[1330.06 → 1330.86] who watched Jesus
[1330.86 → 1331.60] do these miracles,
[1332.02 → 1332.82] who watched Jesus
[1332.82 → 1333.64] fill the stomachs
[1333.64 → 1334.08] of this crowd,
[1334.32 → 1335.04] those disciples,
[1335.38 → 1336.08] many of them,
[1336.16 → 1336.90] were martyred.
[1338.12 → 1338.86] They were killed
[1338.86 → 1339.98] for their faith.
[1340.64 → 1341.34] And I'm guessing,
[1341.54 → 1342.08] this is just a hunch,
[1342.14 → 1342.82] that some of them
[1342.82 → 1343.20] prayed,
[1343.50 → 1343.76] God,
[1343.88 → 1345.04] do not let me die for this,
[1345.04 → 1345.92] and they died for it.
[1346.48 → 1347.28] And so I wanna just
[1347.28 → 1348.18] avoid the extreme
[1348.18 → 1348.46] of saying,
[1348.52 → 1348.58] hey,
[1348.62 → 1349.22] God's going to make life
[1349.22 → 1349.96] easy for you,
[1350.28 → 1350.94] he's going to make life
[1350.94 → 1351.82] wealthy for you
[1351.82 → 1352.82] and simple for you,
[1352.92 → 1354.06] that is not the calling.
[1354.14 → 1354.26] In fact,
[1354.30 → 1355.12] you read all the New Testament
[1355.12 → 1355.48] writers,
[1355.76 → 1356.68] all the New Testament letters,
[1356.68 → 1358.06] there is a lot
[1358.06 → 1359.04] of suffering
[1359.04 → 1360.38] for the kingdom.
[1361.16 → 1361.90] And that does not
[1361.90 → 1362.88] make God less generous,
[1363.32 → 1364.30] does not make his provision
[1364.30 → 1365.12] less abundant,
[1365.24 → 1365.54] because,
[1365.64 → 1365.80] you know,
[1365.84 → 1366.66] the promise that John
[1366.66 → 1367.28] even talks about
[1367.28 → 1367.62] is what?
[1368.08 → 1369.00] Eternal life.
[1369.78 → 1370.76] But I do not want to go
[1370.76 → 1371.52] on either extreme
[1371.52 → 1371.86] saying,
[1371.96 → 1372.04] hey,
[1372.10 → 1372.30] look,
[1372.60 → 1373.48] nothing can be done.
[1374.22 → 1374.82] And the other extreme
[1374.82 → 1375.08] is,
[1375.32 → 1376.06] God's going to do everything
[1376.06 → 1377.16] and make it all easy for us,
[1377.20 → 1377.82] because neither of those
[1377.82 → 1378.18] are true.
[1378.58 → 1379.22] That's not what we read
[1379.22 → 1379.66] in the scriptures.
[1381.98 → 1383.56] God does show
[1383.56 → 1384.12] his provision.
[1384.12 → 1386.24] And Jesus wants
[1386.24 → 1386.92] his disciples
[1386.92 → 1388.16] to have that vision of,
[1388.84 → 1390.36] here's what's now possible.
[1391.10 → 1392.10] And I think as disciples
[1392.10 → 1393.04] in the 21st century
[1393.04 → 1393.74] reading this story,
[1393.94 → 1394.86] we almost need to stop
[1394.86 → 1395.26] and say,
[1395.70 → 1396.58] what are the ways
[1396.58 → 1398.98] that I need to think through
[1398.98 → 1401.04] how this influences my life?
[1401.54 → 1402.36] And I want to highlight
[1402.36 → 1403.00] specifically,
[1403.26 → 1403.74] one of the ways
[1403.74 → 1404.42] that we get selfish
[1404.42 → 1405.52] with a passage like this,
[1405.62 → 1406.30] as Western people,
[1406.38 → 1406.58] we think,
[1406.66 → 1406.76] okay,
[1406.84 → 1408.16] what can God do in my life
[1408.16 → 1408.78] to bless me?
[1408.86 → 1409.50] What can he provide
[1409.50 → 1410.80] for me or for my family?
[1411.04 → 1412.20] And it's important to know
[1412.20 → 1413.02] that the need
[1413.02 → 1413.80] in front of the disciples
[1413.80 → 1414.60] was not them.
[1415.60 → 1416.40] It's true that God
[1416.40 → 1417.24] provides for the disciples,
[1417.34 → 1417.96] but the need in front
[1417.96 → 1418.32] of the disciples
[1418.32 → 1419.30] was the crowd.
[1419.72 → 1420.88] It's the people around them.
[1421.00 → 1421.98] And what God needed to do
[1421.98 → 1423.00] is work through them
[1423.00 → 1423.72] to provide.
[1424.78 → 1425.48] And it's really important
[1425.48 → 1425.98] to realize that
[1425.98 → 1426.70] so much of what,
[1426.80 → 1426.98] you know,
[1427.02 → 1428.06] the promises of God's
[1428.06 → 1428.72] kingdom showing up,
[1428.78 → 1429.58] the promises of God
[1429.58 → 1430.46] showing power,
[1430.82 → 1431.94] is equipping the church
[1431.94 → 1432.64] to bless.
[1433.64 → 1434.34] Equipping the church
[1434.34 → 1434.98] to serve.
[1435.46 → 1435.98] Equipping the church
[1435.98 → 1437.58] to be present in the city
[1437.58 → 1438.50] and show signs
[1438.50 → 1439.20] that the kingdom of God
[1439.20 → 1439.58] has come.
[1440.04 → 1440.94] It's not even necessarily
[1440.94 → 1441.62] first and foremost
[1441.62 → 1442.28] for us.
[1442.44 → 1443.22] It's for the world.
[1443.80 → 1446.18] What are the ways
[1446.18 → 1447.00] he's calling you?
[1448.30 → 1448.80] What are the ways
[1448.80 → 1449.50] he wants to use
[1449.50 → 1450.00] your gifts?
[1451.16 → 1452.20] What ministry
[1452.20 → 1453.18] has been sort of
[1453.18 → 1454.44] percolating in your mind
[1454.44 → 1455.32] or way you can serve
[1455.32 → 1456.00] has been percolating
[1456.00 → 1457.22] that you have fears about,
[1457.76 → 1459.32] that you have worries about,
[1459.60 → 1460.62] that require
[1460.62 → 1461.76] some serious prayer
[1461.76 → 1462.44] for the provision
[1462.44 → 1463.54] of God to show up?
[1463.54 → 1465.50] I think that's an important
[1465.50 → 1465.96] question.
[1468.16 → 1469.24] And I want to name
[1469.24 → 1470.98] an insidious lie
[1470.98 → 1471.84] that resides
[1471.84 → 1472.92] in many of our hearts,
[1473.30 → 1474.10] pastors included.
[1474.96 → 1476.02] You know what that lie is?
[1477.38 → 1478.36] I'm not much use
[1478.36 → 1479.08] for God's kingdom.
[1480.96 → 1481.84] The lie is,
[1481.92 → 1482.68] I don't have much
[1482.68 → 1483.22] to offer.
[1485.40 → 1486.46] Perhaps the reason
[1486.46 → 1487.04] you give is
[1487.04 → 1488.06] I'm not gifted enough.
[1489.16 → 1489.70] Perhaps the reason
[1489.70 → 1490.12] you give is
[1490.12 → 1491.18] I'm not smart enough
[1491.18 → 1492.74] or I'm not skilled enough
[1492.74 → 1493.18] or I don't have
[1493.18 → 1493.86] enough resources
[1493.86 → 1495.04] or often
[1495.04 → 1496.52] I'm too messed up.
[1496.86 → 1497.68] My life's too broken.
[1497.78 → 1498.50] I'm too far gone.
[1498.58 → 1499.50] My sin is too recurring.
[1499.60 → 1500.62] I'm tripped up all the time
[1500.62 → 1501.28] by this, that,
[1501.32 → 1501.76] or the other thing.
[1501.80 → 1501.96] It's like,
[1502.26 → 1502.98] Jesus, I don't have
[1502.98 → 1504.10] much to give you.
[1505.18 → 1505.84] And we can think that
[1505.84 → 1506.68] not just personally,
[1507.24 → 1507.92] but we can think that
[1507.92 → 1508.76] as the church as well.
[1508.82 → 1509.60] We think it collectively.
[1510.42 → 1511.18] I mean, it seems like
[1511.18 → 1511.74] in this season
[1511.74 → 1513.04] there's just a lot of
[1513.04 → 1513.94] discouragement
[1513.94 → 1514.70] around the ministries
[1514.70 → 1515.16] of churches.
[1515.42 → 1515.92] And I get it.
[1515.98 → 1517.18] The church is a broken community.
[1517.68 → 1518.80] It's got abuse that happens.
[1518.92 → 1519.66] We hear about the news
[1519.66 → 1520.14] every other week.
[1520.14 → 1521.06] It's got all sorts
[1521.06 → 1522.04] of internal division
[1522.04 → 1522.64] and conflict.
[1522.74 → 1523.44] It's got weak people
[1523.44 → 1524.06] with brokenness.
[1524.12 → 1524.34] And it's like,
[1524.40 → 1524.72] oh man,
[1524.88 → 1525.88] the church is too weak.
[1525.96 → 1526.74] It's too compromised.
[1526.82 → 1527.68] It's too far gone.
[1527.88 → 1529.12] It's too unconcerned
[1529.12 → 1529.52] for the city.
[1529.60 → 1530.74] What can God really do
[1530.74 → 1531.66] through churches
[1531.66 → 1532.60] in cities like ours
[1532.60 → 1533.10] right here?
[1534.50 → 1535.62] That is not
[1535.62 → 1537.50] where we need to go.
[1539.10 → 1539.96] The same God
[1539.96 → 1540.86] who places us,
[1540.94 → 1541.38] the same God
[1541.38 → 1542.34] who saves us,
[1542.38 → 1542.78] the same God
[1542.78 → 1543.40] who gathers us
[1543.40 → 1544.06] into communities,
[1544.48 → 1545.54] He will send us
[1545.54 → 1546.42] and use us.
[1546.42 → 1549.20] He will send you
[1549.20 → 1550.74] and use you.
[1551.52 → 1552.10] And you don't need
[1552.10 → 1552.48] to be the one
[1552.48 → 1552.92] who worries
[1552.92 → 1554.04] about what you have
[1554.04 → 1554.78] and whether it's enough.
[1554.88 → 1556.44] That's Jesus' problem.
[1556.86 → 1557.02] Right?
[1557.70 → 1558.96] It's Jesus' problem
[1558.96 → 1559.66] to show up
[1559.66 → 1560.52] in power and provision.
[1561.32 → 1561.96] You and me,
[1562.04 → 1563.06] we just show up
[1563.06 → 1565.62] trusting that the same Jesus
[1565.62 → 1566.86] who fed the 5,000
[1566.86 → 1568.16] is still present
[1568.16 → 1568.96] through the church
[1568.96 → 1569.80] by His Spirit
[1569.80 → 1571.40] and He's still
[1571.40 → 1573.26] at work.
[1574.66 → 1575.06] Amen.
[1576.12 → 1576.78] Just think of Jesus
[1576.78 → 1577.92] who says to His disciples
[1577.92 → 1579.22] or to Peter,
[1579.32 → 1579.82] right, the rock,
[1579.86 → 1580.14] He's like,
[1580.38 → 1581.00] the gates of hell
[1581.00 → 1581.58] will not prevail
[1581.58 → 1582.38] against my body.
[1583.40 → 1584.34] Satan will not destroy
[1584.34 → 1584.94] the church
[1584.94 → 1586.20] because the church
[1586.20 → 1586.76] is owned
[1586.76 → 1587.98] by the resurrected king.
[1588.66 → 1589.24] The church isn't
[1589.24 → 1589.86] going to go away
[1589.86 → 1590.60] because it's owned
[1590.60 → 1591.44] by the resurrected king
[1591.44 → 1592.58] and Jesus will work
[1592.58 → 1593.40] His power,
[1593.70 → 1594.42] His strength
[1594.42 → 1595.04] through us
[1595.04 → 1595.50] and our weakness.
[1596.24 → 1597.08] We can trust that.
[1597.16 → 1597.86] And I think of Paul's
[1597.86 → 1598.20] own words.
[1598.26 → 1598.66] He talks about
[1598.66 → 1599.84] a thorn in his flesh
[1599.84 → 1600.72] and the way he's tempted,
[1600.84 → 1602.02] he's got pain in his life
[1602.02 → 1603.04] and he basically says,
[1603.32 → 1603.92] in my weakness
[1603.92 → 1605.72] I discover the power of God.
[1606.98 → 1608.16] In my insufficiency
[1608.16 → 1609.50] I discover the provision
[1609.50 → 1611.26] and the sufficiency of God.
[1612.08 → 1613.00] And I think the church
[1613.00 → 1613.88] needs to realize
[1613.88 → 1615.06] maybe in this season
[1615.06 → 1616.02] of feeling small,
[1616.48 → 1617.30] of feeling weak,
[1617.36 → 1617.52] you know,
[1617.56 → 1618.02] even a church
[1618.02 → 1618.76] in our own community
[1618.76 → 1619.78] closing its doors,
[1619.86 → 1620.94] I don't even know the story,
[1621.26 → 1622.34] but feeling our smallness,
[1622.36 → 1622.92] this is the point
[1622.92 → 1623.26] where we say,
[1623.34 → 1623.78] okay God,
[1624.02 → 1625.20] we see our weakness
[1625.20 → 1626.70] and we want you
[1626.70 → 1627.78] to show up in power.
[1628.66 → 1629.40] And we want to just
[1629.40 → 1630.36] step out in faith
[1630.36 → 1630.78] and saying,
[1631.04 → 1632.26] here's what we do have.
[1633.24 → 1634.30] Use it for your kingdom.
[1635.74 → 1636.46] And this is where
[1636.46 → 1637.02] I want to finish
[1637.02 → 1637.52] by returning
[1637.52 → 1638.30] to my favourite part
[1638.30 → 1639.00] of this piece of art.
[1640.46 → 1641.28] My favourite part
[1641.28 → 1641.90] of this piece of art,
[1641.98 → 1642.12] oh,
[1642.30 → 1643.26] I'm very zoomed out there,
[1643.60 → 1645.42] is the boy.
[1645.52 → 1645.96] I don't know if we can
[1645.96 → 1646.56] zoom in on that,
[1646.64 → 1646.82] John.
[1650.12 → 1650.44] Well,
[1650.56 → 1651.40] you'll have to come up later.
[1651.48 → 1651.56] Oh,
[1651.56 → 1652.04] there it is.
[1653.04 → 1653.86] My favourite part
[1653.86 → 1654.62] is this little boy.
[1654.72 → 1655.38] And I just want to share
[1655.38 → 1657.02] personally that over
[1657.02 → 1658.40] the last five years
[1658.40 → 1659.36] since I've had this piece,
[1659.70 → 1660.80] I've been in my office
[1660.80 → 1662.38] facing my own insufficiencies,
[1662.60 → 1663.76] facing my own problems,
[1663.86 → 1664.70] facing some of the challenges
[1664.70 → 1665.40] as a pastor,
[1665.62 → 1666.82] and I can often just stare
[1666.82 → 1668.16] blankly across my office.
[1668.24 → 1668.94] And I find myself
[1668.94 → 1669.64] staring at the very wall
[1669.64 → 1670.36] where this art is,
[1670.60 → 1671.68] and God places in me
[1671.68 → 1673.34] a desire to be this boy.
[1674.38 → 1675.06] That is to say,
[1675.24 → 1676.38] I don't have the skills,
[1676.52 → 1677.38] I don't have the resources
[1677.38 → 1678.48] to do all the stuff
[1678.48 → 1679.12] I need to do,
[1679.12 → 1680.22] to serve how I'm called
[1680.22 → 1680.58] to serve.
[1680.84 → 1681.52] And I look at this boy,
[1681.58 → 1682.52] he's got five loaves
[1682.52 → 1683.18] and two fish,
[1683.36 → 1684.68] and he holds the tray
[1684.68 → 1685.46] to Jesus,
[1686.48 → 1686.82] and says,
[1686.96 → 1688.08] this is what I have.
[1688.60 → 1689.62] And Jesus is the one
[1689.62 → 1690.24] who takes it
[1690.24 → 1691.62] and multiplies it.
[1692.52 → 1693.26] Jesus is the one
[1693.26 → 1693.80] who takes our
[1693.80 → 1694.70] insufficient resources
[1694.70 → 1695.78] and does something
[1695.78 → 1696.88] for his kingdom with it.
[1697.32 → 1699.24] We'll make our small offering
[1699.24 → 1700.76] something Jesus uses
[1700.76 → 1701.88] for the good of the world,
[1702.38 → 1703.52] for the life of the world.
[1704.66 → 1705.32] Isn't that a vision
[1705.32 → 1706.42] for all of our lives?
[1707.00 → 1708.62] You take what little you have,
[1709.00 → 1709.92] that little tray
[1709.92 → 1710.92] of bread and fish,
[1710.98 → 1711.20] you say,
[1711.20 → 1712.58] Jesus, it's yours.
[1713.30 → 1713.98] I'm going to live
[1713.98 → 1715.28] by faith with this,
[1715.66 → 1717.16] not bemoan, complain,
[1717.38 → 1718.10] self-deprecate
[1718.10 → 1719.04] how little I have.
[1719.22 → 1720.44] It's in your hands.
[1721.50 → 1722.20] You're the one
[1722.20 → 1723.28] who defeated sin.
[1723.62 → 1724.36] You're the one
[1724.36 → 1725.28] who went to the cross.
[1725.36 → 1725.66] You're the one
[1725.66 → 1726.36] who exhausted
[1726.36 → 1727.28] the powers of darkness
[1727.28 → 1728.20] of everything they had,
[1728.32 → 1729.32] and you're the only one
[1729.32 → 1730.08] who rose victorious
[1730.08 → 1730.68] from the grave.
[1731.02 → 1732.16] And so here you go.
[1732.84 → 1733.34] You're the one
[1733.34 → 1734.42] with resurrection power
[1734.42 → 1736.46] to make the kingdom come.
[1737.16 → 1737.98] Take my life,
[1738.56 → 1739.38] take my resources,
[1739.88 → 1740.76] take my time,
[1740.76 → 1742.46] and make it good
[1742.46 → 1743.20] for your kingdom.
[1745.86 → 1746.58] I'm going to finish
[1746.58 → 1746.98] with a quote
[1746.98 → 1748.02] by William Barclay.
[1749.50 → 1750.34] When I read this,
[1750.40 → 1750.74] I just thought,
[1750.82 → 1751.12] oh man,
[1751.16 → 1751.94] he's preaching to me.
[1752.02 → 1752.84] So if he's preaching to me,
[1752.88 → 1753.74] he can preach to you too.
[1754.14 → 1754.64] He writes,
[1754.78 → 1756.76] Jesus needs what we can bring him.
[1757.58 → 1758.66] May not be much,
[1758.76 → 1759.46] but he needs it.
[1760.18 → 1761.04] It may well be
[1761.04 → 1761.58] that the world
[1761.58 → 1762.66] is denied miracle
[1762.66 → 1763.60] after miracle
[1763.60 → 1764.32] and triumph
[1764.32 → 1765.18] after triumph
[1765.18 → 1766.18] because we will not
[1766.18 → 1766.92] bring to Jesus
[1766.92 → 1768.14] what we have
[1768.14 → 1769.00] and what we are.
[1769.00 → 1770.26] Did you hear that?
[1771.58 → 1773.12] If we would lay ourselves
[1773.12 → 1773.82] on the altar
[1773.82 → 1774.50] of his service,
[1774.62 → 1775.58] there is no saying
[1775.58 → 1776.40] what he could do
[1776.40 → 1777.68] with us and through us.
[1778.10 → 1779.06] We may be sorry
[1779.06 → 1779.96] and embarrassed
[1779.96 → 1781.56] that we have not more
[1781.56 → 1782.06] to bring,
[1782.78 → 1783.72] and rightly so,
[1784.28 → 1785.62] but that is no reason
[1785.62 → 1786.74] for failing to bring
[1786.74 → 1788.18] what we have.
[1789.06 → 1790.80] Little is always much
[1790.80 → 1792.62] in the hands of Christ.
[1794.62 → 1795.10] Amen.
[1795.10 → 1798.68] We are going to go
[1798.68 → 1799.18] to the table
[1799.18 → 1799.72] in just a minute
[1799.72 → 1800.28] and celebrate
[1800.28 → 1801.56] the meal of grace.
[1801.84 → 1802.50] And what I want to do
[1802.50 → 1803.16] is leave us,
[1803.36 → 1803.88] or lead us,
[1803.92 → 1804.38] I should say.
[1804.50 → 1805.16] I am not going to leave us.
[1805.60 → 1806.80] Lead us in a time of prayer.
[1807.42 → 1808.50] And I want to take time
[1808.50 → 1809.44] in that prayer for silence
[1809.44 → 1810.24] and I want you to bring
[1810.24 → 1811.72] whatever insufficiency,
[1811.96 → 1812.92] whatever inadequacy,
[1813.00 → 1813.80] whatever challenges
[1813.80 → 1814.46] you are facing
[1814.46 → 1815.42] to the throne of grace.
[1815.82 → 1816.62] And then we are going to receive
[1816.62 → 1817.42] the meal of grace.
[1817.50 → 1817.90] So there is going to be
[1817.90 → 1818.80] a long time of silence.
[1818.90 → 1819.68] I will conclude the prayer.
[1820.30 → 1820.88] Hopefully someone
[1820.88 → 1821.60] will bring our children
[1821.60 → 1822.38] down from Cornerstone
[1822.38 → 1823.06] to celebrate the meal
[1823.06 → 1823.60] with us,
[1823.74 → 1824.64] but let's begin
[1824.64 → 1825.66] and have some time
[1825.66 → 1826.12] in prayer.
[1833.02 → 1833.42] Father,
[1833.50 → 1834.70] we begin by thanking you
[1834.70 → 1835.76] for being such
[1835.76 → 1836.78] a generous provider.
[1838.40 → 1839.16] We thank you
[1839.16 → 1839.68] for the story
[1839.68 → 1840.70] where Jesus shows up
[1840.70 → 1841.30] in power,
[1842.64 → 1843.52] for the way he shows
[1843.52 → 1844.82] disciples how to live
[1844.82 → 1845.52] with a new vision.
[1846.60 → 1847.24] He demonstrates
[1847.24 → 1848.20] that he knows
[1848.20 → 1849.76] and can meet our needs,
[1850.48 → 1851.68] and not just scarcely,
[1851.84 → 1852.48] but with abundance.
[1853.92 → 1854.44] And so, Father,
[1854.50 → 1855.22] we now bring before
[1855.22 → 1855.88] your throne
[1855.88 → 1857.66] our challenges,
[1858.98 → 1860.32] our inadequacies,
[1861.22 → 1863.02] our fears for ministry,
[1863.20 → 1864.58] our fears for the future.
[1865.54 → 1866.62] We bring before you
[1866.62 → 1867.76] all of our needs,
[1868.20 → 1869.50] and we're going to let you
[1869.50 → 1870.08] be God
[1870.08 → 1872.24] and trust that you will provide.
[1872.36 → 1873.14] So hear them now
[1873.14 → 1873.70] as we bring them
[1873.70 → 1874.72] to your throne of grace.
[1874.72 → 1874.82] Amen.
[1874.82 → 1874.88] Amen.
[1874.88 → 1874.92] Amen.
[1874.92 → 1874.98] Amen.
[1874.98 → 1875.02] Amen.
[1883.06 → 1884.58] Amen.
[1884.58 → 1885.42] Amen.
[1885.44 → 1885.90] Amen.
[1886.84 → 1887.34] Amen.
[1887.60 → 1887.98] Amen.
[1887.98 → 1888.00] Amen.
[1888.10 → 1888.84] Amen.
[1888.84 → 1889.12] Amen.
[1889.12 → 1889.96] Amen.
[1889.96 → 1890.96] Amen.
[1890.96 → 1920.94] Thank you.
[1920.96 → 1925.18] Father, we thank you for the cross.
[1926.20 → 1928.44] We thank you that the victory has been won.
[1929.78 → 1934.86] And we thank you that our lives and our church is in the hands of the resurrected King Jesus.
[1936.16 → 1937.36] Teach us to trust.
[1938.66 → 1939.80] Give us a kingdom vision.
[1940.66 → 1942.74] And fill us with the life of the Holy Spirit.
[1943.46 → 1943.70] Amen.
[1947.44 → 1949.48] Well, children, welcome back to the service.
[1950.16 → 1953.06] And it's a gift to share this meal with you.
[1953.06 → 1954.06] Thank you.
[1954.16 → 1955.06] Thank you.
[1955.06 → 1956.06] Thank you.
[1956.48 → 1957.06] Thank you.
[1957.06 → 1957.12] Thank you.
[1957.12 → 1958.06] Thank you.
[1958.18 → 1959.06] Thank you.
