[0.00 → 15.70] As Ken just prayed, we are going to continue our series in the Honest Psalms.
[16.28 → 20.64] And this morning we're going to be looking at a very honest psalm, that is Psalm 90.
[21.28 → 26.54] If you have your Bible on your phone or a physical Bible, I invite you to turn to Psalm 90 with me.
[26.68 → 27.40] We'll read it together.
[30.00 → 39.28] This is one of the older psalms, and I'll say in a few minutes more about that.
[40.20 → 44.44] Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.
[45.22 → 52.58] Before the mountains were born, or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[53.34 → 57.10] You turn people to dust, saying, return to dust, you mortals.
[57.10 → 64.06] A thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.
[64.74 → 66.78] Yet you sweep people away in the sleep of death.
[66.92 → 69.04] They are like the new grass of the morning.
[69.70 → 73.02] In the morning it springs up new, but by evening it is dry and withered.
[74.00 → 78.42] We are consumed by your anger, terrified by your indignation.
[78.42 → 83.64] You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.
[84.34 → 86.96] All of our days pass away under your wrath.
[87.46 → 89.28] We finish our years with a moan.
[89.80 → 94.44] Our days come to 70 years, or 80 if our strength endures.
[94.96 → 98.88] Yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow.
[99.56 → 102.06] For they quickly pass away and we fly away.
[102.06 → 105.88] If only we knew the power of your anger.
[106.60 → 109.76] Your wrath is as great as the fear that is your doom.
[111.34 → 115.64] Teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
[116.66 → 118.74] Relent, Lord, how long will it be?
[119.74 → 121.42] Have compassion on your servants.
[122.62 → 128.44] Satisfy in the morning with your unfailing love that we may sing for joy and be glad all of our days.
[128.44 → 131.96] Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us.
[132.24 → 134.64] For as many years as we have seen trouble.
[135.58 → 137.90] May your deeds be shown to your servants.
[138.58 → 140.58] Your splendour to their children.
[141.62 → 144.12] May the favour of the Lord rest on us.
[145.10 → 147.64] Establish the work of our hands for us.
[148.48 → 151.86] Yes, establish the works of our hands.
[151.86 → 162.86] Well, Jonathan and Moon, there's a very common piece of advice that people give to young parents.
[162.94 → 165.26] And I'm curious if you've heard this piece of advice.
[166.12 → 168.92] The advice which I actually got even last Sunday is,
[169.82 → 173.10] Savoy every moment of this season.
[173.58 → 175.50] Because the years go by quickly.
[175.62 → 176.26] Have you heard that?
[177.02 → 178.08] Anyone else heard that?
[179.02 → 180.76] It's a common piece of advice.
[180.76 → 184.48] And to be honest, when I first heard it, I wasn't sure what to make of it.
[184.54 → 187.90] Because Brittany and I were in the throes of our firstborn as a newborn.
[188.64 → 194.08] And, you know, I wasn't particularly keen on savouring changing diapers in public washrooms.
[194.30 → 194.76] How about you?
[195.30 → 202.16] I wasn't keen on savouring those discussions that Brittany and I would have about whose turn it was to calm the crying baby at 2 in the morning.
[202.86 → 205.58] I wasn't keen on remembering, you know, the conversations where people were like,
[205.62 → 208.48] You've got this patch of yellow grossness on your shoulder.
[208.48 → 211.20] You're Savoy every moment.
[211.20 → 216.42] And yet, now 10 years into this parenting thing, I get a little bit more why people say that.
[216.46 → 217.26] Because it's true.
[218.18 → 221.54] The days go by slowly, but the years are like this.
[222.16 → 222.42] Right?
[222.42 → 226.84] And it goes very, very quickly.
[227.06 → 229.64] One day, you're a teenage student in high school.
[229.76 → 233.16] The next day, you're holding your first child with your spouse.
[233.52 → 236.86] And the next day, those children are bringing you off to Elam Care Home.
[237.14 → 238.52] And they didn't even ask for your permission.
[239.98 → 242.18] I heard some nervous laughter from our seniors.
[242.18 → 245.84] It goes quickly.
[246.86 → 254.32] And I think a piece of that advice, this is just my hunch, is not just that life goes by fast, but also that life often gets hard.
[255.40 → 263.88] There's a sense in which someone who's older and seasoned knows that the terrible twos, they got nothing on what you might call the tribulation teens.
[264.12 → 264.28] Right?
[264.28 → 271.70] And the innocence and simplicity of children in the newborn stage, that is a time-bound gift.
[272.46 → 273.38] Things get hard.
[273.90 → 275.00] Things get complicated.
[275.98 → 277.10] Life goes fast.
[278.88 → 288.04] Psalm 90, if I could summarize it into a sentence, is an honest prayer about the difficulty and the brevity of life.
[288.48 → 289.36] That's Psalm 90.
[289.36 → 297.82] It's an honest prayer that I think hits a deep desire in all of us because at the centre of it, I think is an honest cry to God saying,
[297.82 → 300.58] God, life is short and life is hard.
[301.14 → 303.26] Help me do well with it.
[303.96 → 308.38] Help me not to waste it and make the most of the short life you give me.
[308.62 → 312.84] Help me be wise with the years I have before me.
[313.54 → 315.30] That desire lives deeply in us.
[315.36 → 317.54] And that's the prayer of Psalm 90.
[317.54 → 322.98] Now, the subtitle of the psalm gives us a hint about the context.
[323.12 → 324.76] And it says it's a prayer of Moses.
[324.88 → 327.60] This is an old psalm, like Pastor Sid old.
[328.78 → 331.76] He and Moses grew up together.
[331.86 → 332.56] I don't know if you know that.
[334.66 → 336.14] Oh, he stood up.
[337.02 → 338.92] Sid has thrown me under the bus in many sermons.
[338.98 → 339.90] I'm allowed to make jokes.
[341.40 → 345.54] But more seriously, scholars will say that this is a psalm likely written by Pastor Sid.
[345.54 → 346.30] He's going to say Pastor Sid.
[348.50 → 349.82] Not written by Pastor Sid.
[349.90 → 350.84] Written by Moses.
[353.22 → 354.28] Later in his life.
[354.98 → 357.70] And Moses, if you know the story, had a very hard life.
[357.80 → 359.50] He grew up, of course, in Egypt.
[359.64 → 362.48] He grew up in the palace with education and with luxury.
[362.76 → 366.96] But God called him out of that to lead the slave nation that is Israel out of bondage.
[366.96 → 371.50] And most of Moses' life was wandering to the wilderness.
[371.74 → 376.22] It was leading an extremely difficult group of people to follow God's ways.
[376.64 → 381.18] And if you're wondering why is there so much speaking of anger and wrath and difficulty,
[381.68 → 386.66] it's because Moses saw a super rebellious people reject God over and over and over
[386.66 → 389.10] and watch the consequences of that action.
[389.22 → 394.98] That's why this psalm is filled with so much pain around God's anger related to the rebellion of Israel.
[394.98 → 400.72] This is a psalm written by a man later in life looking back over the harsh realities of it
[400.72 → 404.26] and saying, Lord, help me live what I have left well.
[405.16 → 406.32] It's a prayer for wisdom.
[406.90 → 411.68] And it's a prayer prayed by someone who is deeply honest about the realities of life.
[412.08 → 413.58] Listen to how this prayer starts.
[414.76 → 415.20] Verse 1.
[415.20 → 431.92] In a prayer that focuses on the brevity and difficulty of life,
[432.32 → 436.80] Moses starts just like so many other psalms with the everlasting God.
[436.80 → 441.46] And striking to me, in fact, Misha pointed this out at the beginning of the service,
[441.80 → 442.26] is he says,
[442.42 → 445.44] You, Lord, have been our dwelling place.
[446.52 → 450.22] For a man who spent most of his life wandering through the wilderness
[450.22 → 452.56] with no real place to call his own home,
[452.84 → 454.02] he says to God,
[454.44 → 455.38] You are home.
[455.90 → 457.92] Home for Moses is not walls and a roof.
[458.18 → 459.34] Home is a person.
[460.28 → 463.08] That is a deep, deep statement.
[463.76 → 466.60] That, by the way, is why when you go to a funeral of someone who loved the Lord,
[466.72 → 468.00] you'll often hear the pastor say,
[468.46 → 471.00] This person whom he loved is home.
[471.90 → 474.44] Because home is in the presence of God.
[474.52 → 478.08] And for Moses, it did not matter that he did not have his own roof and walls.
[478.30 → 479.38] He had the Lord.
[479.92 → 483.06] And it's the Lord that gave purpose and meaning and significance
[483.06 → 485.66] to his very difficult life leading Israel.
[486.80 → 489.54] Now, Moses makes these two simple observations
[489.54 → 491.52] for the first 11 verses of this psalm.
[491.52 → 494.48] And the first is, life is short.
[495.12 → 497.56] Teenagers, children, believe it.
[498.06 → 498.74] Life is short.
[499.26 → 501.58] And he writes in verse 3 and 5,
[502.34 → 504.12] You turn people back to dust,
[504.50 → 506.50] saying, Return to dust, you mortal.
[507.04 → 509.46] You sweep people away in the sleep of death.
[509.54 → 512.20] They are like the new grass of the morning.
[513.22 → 516.22] Think of the two images that Moses uses to describe humanity.
[516.22 → 519.06] Dust and grass.
[520.50 → 522.62] Small and fleeting.
[523.36 → 525.18] And I'll say to our young people especially,
[525.36 → 528.56] It feels sometimes like your life will just keep going the way it is.
[528.62 → 530.42] You'll always be strong, healthy, and vital.
[530.54 → 532.06] Things will just keep moving on the way they are,
[532.18 → 532.96] but they don't.
[534.08 → 535.20] Life is short.
[535.70 → 536.72] And as I already joked,
[537.06 → 538.66] the children that you hold in your arms
[538.66 → 541.10] will one day be bringing you off to Elam quickly.
[541.10 → 544.90] History moves on without us.
[545.66 → 547.46] I still think of my grandparents' funeral
[547.46 → 549.78] and how quickly I as a young person,
[549.86 → 551.46] my grandparents died a number of years ago now,
[551.72 → 552.42] you move on.
[552.86 → 554.16] You almost forget about them.
[554.20 → 554.52] And you think,
[554.62 → 556.50] The same is going to happen to me
[556.50 → 559.46] and you in a short period of time.
[560.60 → 562.54] The second observation that Moses makes
[562.54 → 563.64] in verses 7 to 11
[563.64 → 565.52] is the difficulty of life.
[565.94 → 567.50] Listen to how he prays in verse 10.
[567.50 → 570.80] Our days may come to 70 years
[570.80 → 573.80] or 80 if our strength endures,
[574.36 → 576.14] yet the best of them
[576.14 → 579.04] are but trouble and sorrow.
[580.24 → 580.60] Whew!
[581.42 → 583.60] That's not exactly the encouraging words
[583.60 → 585.08] you might expect from the psalm.
[585.46 → 588.58] The best of them are but trouble and sorrow.
[588.68 → 590.34] And maybe the young people this morning are like,
[590.46 → 591.62] Wow, that's heavy.
[592.14 → 593.72] But those of us who maybe are seasoned,
[593.88 → 595.90] have been around for a few more years than others,
[596.00 → 597.10] you might be thinking to yourself,
[597.50 → 598.80] that sounds about right.
[599.70 → 600.84] Because as you go through life,
[600.90 → 602.80] you experience the pain of life.
[603.40 → 605.14] Anyone living post-Genesis 3
[605.14 → 607.90] knows about the trials and the sorrows of life.
[608.50 → 609.88] Friendships break.
[610.84 → 612.86] You experience turmoil in your health.
[613.12 → 614.36] That body that was so healthy
[614.36 → 617.04] is no longer as dependable and strong as it once was.
[617.36 → 619.22] You experience friends die.
[619.44 → 620.46] Parents pass away.
[620.84 → 623.30] You experience very close loved ones.
[623.30 → 625.04] You see their marriage dissolve.
[625.92 → 627.30] You experience financial hardship
[627.30 → 629.10] with jobs change and go.
[630.38 → 631.66] There is sorrow and trouble.
[632.26 → 633.12] But I want to highlight that
[633.12 → 634.74] when Moses talks about the sorrow and trouble,
[634.84 → 635.78] he's not just talking about
[635.78 → 636.94] sort of the brokenness of the world
[636.94 → 638.02] we can't help but experience.
[638.12 → 638.92] He's also talking about
[638.92 → 641.10] the rebellion of the human heart.
[641.58 → 642.36] As I already mentioned,
[642.50 → 644.16] Moses has witnessed firsthand
[644.16 → 646.02] for year upon year
[646.02 → 648.30] a people that hear God say,
[648.38 → 649.00] I'm going to lead you.
[649.06 → 649.80] I'm going to rescue you.
[649.86 → 651.04] I'm going to be your God.
[651.04 → 652.76] And they say, no, thank you.
[654.14 → 656.42] In the story in Exodus 34,
[656.66 → 658.38] it has Moses up on the mountain
[658.38 → 660.04] where God is inscribing instruction
[660.58 → 661.76] to lead his people.
[662.02 → 663.46] And what are they doing at the foot of the mountain?
[664.50 → 666.96] They're crafting a golden calf to worship and fall.
[668.26 → 670.64] Moses has seen how the rebellious nature
[670.64 → 672.12] of the human heart leads to pain
[672.12 → 673.64] over and over and over.
[674.04 → 676.06] And Sid said this in a sermon just a few weeks ago.
[676.18 → 677.76] I'll say a nice thing about you, Pastor Sid.
[677.76 → 680.02] A few weeks ago about how the instruction of God
[680.02 → 680.74] leads to life.
[680.86 → 682.56] And so often the default of humans
[682.56 → 684.20] in the rebellion is no thank you.
[684.30 → 685.64] And that leads to pain.
[686.70 → 687.68] Sin is powerful.
[687.90 → 688.66] Sin is pervasive.
[688.90 → 690.66] And sin leads to pain.
[691.60 → 693.48] And Moses has seen with his own eyes
[693.48 → 696.76] the pain that rebellion has caused.
[697.56 → 698.86] You know, one commentator pointed out
[698.86 → 700.10] very interestingly that
[700.10 → 702.08] when Israel was told
[702.08 → 703.46] they're going to be led to the promised land
[703.46 → 704.04] and they doubted
[704.04 → 705.20] and they didn't believe that God would do it,
[705.36 → 705.86] they were told,
[705.96 → 707.06] you can't enter the promised land.
[707.06 → 708.74] A whole generation needs to die off
[708.74 → 709.72] before you enter.
[709.80 → 711.60] Even Moses can't enter the promised land.
[712.12 → 713.08] Moses would have witnessed
[713.08 → 716.62] 50,000 people at least die.
[717.66 → 719.12] He would have participated perhaps
[719.12 → 722.34] in 50,000 funerals.
[722.90 → 725.22] So when he talks about hardship and sorrow,
[725.40 → 727.50] he knows something about what he's talking about.
[727.60 → 729.72] Life for Moses in this prayer is short
[729.72 → 731.64] and life is hard.
[732.08 → 733.20] And I can't help but highlight
[733.20 → 735.12] how that runs so against the grain
[735.12 → 737.16] of the cultural narrative that we live in.
[737.48 → 738.34] You know, you watch commercials,
[738.48 → 739.14] you scroll Instagram,
[739.54 → 740.56] you'll see so many ads
[740.56 → 741.90] about how life should be easy.
[742.10 → 742.92] Life should be healthy.
[743.04 → 744.10] You're going to live a long life.
[744.18 → 744.80] And Moses is like,
[745.06 → 745.70] not so sure.
[746.58 → 747.34] Life is short
[747.34 → 748.64] and life is difficult.
[748.80 → 750.36] And I think Moses has it right
[750.36 → 751.38] for the most part.
[753.28 → 753.88] That is to say,
[753.94 → 754.66] Moses has it right
[754.66 → 755.60] for most of our lives.
[755.66 → 756.56] Most of us live short
[756.56 → 757.62] and difficult lives.
[758.38 → 759.72] Now it's against this backdrop
[759.72 → 761.84] that Moses makes four specific prayer requests.
[761.92 → 762.84] I'm going to spend the rest of our time
[762.84 → 764.20] this morning on these four requests.
[764.30 → 764.74] They are,
[765.10 → 766.02] first request,
[766.16 → 767.30] Moses asked God
[767.30 → 768.16] for a heart of wisdom
[768.16 → 768.90] in verse 12.
[769.98 → 770.40] Secondly,
[770.54 → 771.48] Moses asked God
[771.48 → 772.42] for the ability,
[772.62 → 773.10] and I love this,
[773.14 → 774.50] to enjoy life.
[774.88 → 776.02] Verse 14 and 15.
[776.86 → 777.24] Thirdly,
[777.30 → 778.08] Moses asked God
[778.08 → 779.82] to reveal himself,
[780.02 → 780.66] his splendour
[780.66 → 781.26] and his power
[781.26 → 782.00] in verse 16.
[782.66 → 783.42] And then finally,
[783.60 → 784.92] Moses finishes by praying
[784.92 → 786.50] for God's blessing.
[786.50 → 789.12] establish the work of our hands
[789.12 → 789.94] in verse 17.
[790.88 → 792.48] So let's look at these four prayer requests
[792.48 → 792.82] in turn.
[792.96 → 793.30] First,
[793.86 → 794.82] Moses prays
[794.82 → 796.56] for a heart of wisdom.
[797.70 → 798.12] He says,
[798.52 → 798.94] teach us, Lord,
[799.00 → 800.14] to number our days
[800.14 → 801.12] that we may gain
[801.12 → 802.76] a heart of wisdom.
[803.66 → 805.02] Most commentators say
[805.02 → 805.74] this is the centre
[805.74 → 806.82] of the whole prayer.
[807.58 → 808.28] Teach us, Lord,
[808.34 → 809.58] to know how short
[809.58 → 810.50] our lives are
[810.50 → 812.08] so that we don't waste them.
[812.76 → 813.92] That's kind of the gist of it.
[814.16 → 814.90] A heart of wisdom,
[815.00 → 815.22] by the way,
[815.26 → 816.04] when you hear that word wisdom,
[816.04 → 816.64] don't be thinking
[816.64 → 817.40] of some philosopher
[817.40 → 817.84] out there
[817.84 → 819.02] doing some philosophizing.
[819.68 → 820.46] Wisdom for Moses
[820.46 → 822.18] is practical know-how.
[823.10 → 823.76] Wisdom is like
[823.76 → 825.34] navigating carefully
[825.34 → 826.08] and wisely
[826.08 → 826.78] the harsh,
[827.02 → 827.86] difficult complexities
[827.86 → 829.36] of life well.
[829.60 → 830.20] That's wisdom.
[830.84 → 831.84] Practical know-how
[831.84 → 833.16] on navigating life
[833.16 → 834.58] with all of its complexity.
[834.74 → 835.90] That's living wisely.
[836.72 → 837.26] Or to put it
[837.26 → 838.16] a different way entirely,
[838.96 → 839.72] wisdom is,
[840.64 → 841.62] according to Psalm 90,
[841.76 → 842.46] recognizing life
[842.46 → 843.38] is short and hard.
[843.80 → 844.96] So you take stock
[844.96 → 845.62] of your time
[845.62 → 846.96] you take stock
[846.96 → 847.58] of your gifts,
[847.68 → 848.40] you take stock
[848.40 → 849.20] of your relationships
[849.20 → 849.96] and your influence,
[850.18 → 851.24] and you simply put it
[851.24 → 852.22] before the Lord saying,
[852.68 → 855.10] help me serve well.
[856.32 → 857.28] Help me use
[857.28 → 858.38] the gifts you've given me,
[858.46 → 859.60] the talents you've given me,
[859.66 → 861.60] the time you've given me
[861.60 → 863.36] to love my neighbours,
[864.36 → 865.90] to serve my family,
[866.48 → 867.52] and to be a blessing.
[867.52 → 869.60] That's wisdom
[869.60 → 871.14] in Psalm 90.
[872.14 → 873.66] And I can't help but think
[873.66 → 874.80] what a word and season
[874.80 → 876.44] it is in our day.
[876.74 → 877.56] You know, Dallas Willard,
[877.66 → 878.52] one of my favourite writers,
[878.88 → 879.18] he said,
[879.30 → 879.72] in our day,
[879.80 → 880.52] what we do not need
[880.52 → 881.56] is more smart people,
[881.72 → 882.46] though they are a gift.
[882.90 → 883.88] We don't need more smart people.
[883.94 → 885.68] We need more wise people
[885.68 → 887.52] who are holding out
[887.52 → 888.52] their lives before God,
[888.58 → 888.74] saying,
[888.82 → 889.04] Lord,
[889.14 → 890.28] do what you will
[890.28 → 891.22] with my short life.
[891.30 → 892.44] May it be purposed
[892.44 → 893.36] for your kingdom.
[893.86 → 894.80] May the short life
[894.80 → 895.32] you've given me
[895.32 → 896.20] be put to use
[896.20 → 897.24] in meaningful ways
[897.24 → 899.48] to serve and to bless.
[900.32 → 901.00] That's wisdom.
[902.50 → 903.76] And it's a word and season
[903.76 → 905.28] in part because I do think
[905.28 → 906.56] we live in,
[906.66 → 907.74] one writer says,
[907.82 → 909.10] an economy of distraction
[909.10 → 911.62] where there are so many
[911.62 → 913.12] carefully crafted ways
[913.12 → 914.98] to waste our years.
[915.82 → 917.04] There are so many
[917.04 → 918.22] next episodes,
[919.20 → 920.48] so many things
[920.48 → 921.18] to scroll down.
[921.28 → 921.74] Have you ever noticed
[921.74 → 922.74] at the bottom of social media
[922.74 → 923.46] there is no bottom?
[923.80 → 924.90] You just keep scrolling forever.
[925.32 → 926.80] You can scroll until you die
[926.80 → 928.00] and then you will have
[928.00 → 929.22] wasted your entire life.
[929.98 → 931.10] But that's the context
[931.10 → 931.68] we live in.
[932.24 → 933.14] And against that,
[933.24 → 933.98] Moses is saying,
[934.10 → 934.38] Lord,
[934.60 → 936.26] give us a heart of wisdom
[936.26 → 937.68] because life is short
[937.68 → 938.84] and you will not say
[938.84 → 939.54] on your deathbed,
[939.66 → 940.86] I wish I scrolled Instagram
[940.86 → 942.04] just a few more minutes.
[942.60 → 943.54] I say that seriously.
[945.30 → 946.38] Request number two,
[946.86 → 948.52] the ability to enjoy life.
[948.64 → 949.48] Oh, I love this one.
[949.58 → 950.68] Verse 13 and 15,
[950.82 → 952.10] Moses prays to God,
[952.60 → 954.04] satisfy us in the morning
[954.04 → 955.18] with your unfailing love
[955.18 → 956.76] that may me sing for joy
[956.76 → 958.66] and be glad all of our days.
[959.14 → 961.24] Make us glad for as many days
[961.24 → 963.36] as you have afflicted us.
[964.26 → 965.94] Sobering and interesting prayer.
[966.62 → 967.98] It almost feels strange.
[968.26 → 970.06] Make us glad for as many days
[970.06 → 970.90] as you would have afflicted us.
[971.02 → 972.28] He knows that life is hard.
[972.72 → 974.16] Moses knows that they're experiencing
[974.16 → 975.02] the judgment of God
[975.02 → 975.70] for the rebellion.
[975.82 → 975.98] He says,
[976.08 → 978.72] Lord, enable us yet
[978.72 → 980.54] to enjoy life.
[981.40 → 982.44] And underneath that prayer
[982.44 → 984.00] is this really deep conviction
[984.00 → 984.66] about God
[984.66 → 985.86] and about God's world.
[986.08 → 986.98] And that conviction is,
[987.36 → 988.82] God is a loving, good Father
[988.82 → 990.20] who places humans
[990.20 → 991.86] in a very good creation.
[992.98 → 993.82] Here's how I put it
[993.82 → 995.30] or how I have put it in the past.
[995.58 → 996.66] God could have created
[996.66 → 997.90] a world that's black and white.
[998.04 → 998.60] You know that, right?
[999.40 → 1000.40] But He created us in a world
[1000.40 → 1001.60] with stunning green mountains
[1001.60 → 1004.00] and incredible sunsets
[1004.00 → 1005.54] to take in and enjoy.
[1006.42 → 1007.96] God could have created you and me
[1007.96 → 1009.34] without taste buds and smell.
[1010.22 → 1010.86] And since COVID,
[1010.94 → 1011.78] I haven't gotten those back.
[1011.88 → 1012.88] Praying that they do come back.
[1013.04 → 1013.94] You can join me in that prayer.
[1014.30 → 1015.06] He could have created us
[1015.06 → 1016.06] without taste buds and smell.
[1016.22 → 1017.86] But He enables us to experience
[1017.86 → 1020.14] sinking our teeth into a steak.
[1022.56 → 1024.68] And tasting an aged wine.
[1026.22 → 1027.18] Or an IPA.
[1027.18 → 1028.56] If you're not a wine drinker.
[1030.10 → 1031.22] He could have created us
[1031.22 → 1032.90] as isolated people.
[1033.52 → 1033.96] But instead,
[1034.12 → 1035.28] He allows us to enjoy
[1035.28 → 1035.88] and think about
[1035.88 → 1036.68] just how you've experienced
[1036.68 → 1037.34] this summer already.
[1037.72 → 1038.92] He enabled us to experience
[1038.92 → 1040.44] the joy of friendship.
[1041.34 → 1042.76] Of sitting on the campsite
[1042.76 → 1044.18] with family and friends
[1044.18 → 1045.52] laughing together.
[1046.40 → 1048.60] He created us to enjoy
[1048.60 → 1050.24] the intimacy of marriage.
[1051.28 → 1053.30] The gift of playing with children
[1053.30 → 1054.14] and grandchildren.
[1054.98 → 1056.02] Those are always
[1056.02 → 1056.94] that God says,
[1057.46 → 1058.06] I love you.
[1058.42 → 1061.20] And I want you to enjoy life
[1061.20 → 1062.62] in my creation.
[1063.28 → 1064.28] And Moses is saying
[1064.28 → 1065.08] in such a profound,
[1065.32 → 1065.74] honest way,
[1066.00 → 1067.38] I know life is difficult.
[1067.92 → 1069.34] I know we are rebellious.
[1069.44 → 1069.90] But Lord,
[1070.22 → 1072.16] enable us to sing
[1072.16 → 1073.92] and be glad
[1073.92 → 1075.96] in spite of that difficulty
[1075.96 → 1077.52] and enjoy your presence.
[1078.32 → 1079.52] That's a deep prayer.
[1080.68 → 1081.32] And you know,
[1081.40 → 1081.88] when I was working
[1081.88 → 1082.94] on this part of the sermon,
[1083.60 → 1084.50] I was thinking about
[1084.50 → 1085.18] my own pacha,
[1085.36 → 1086.78] which is free for grandpa.
[1086.78 → 1088.98] And my pacha and his wife,
[1089.18 → 1089.72] my grandma,
[1090.04 → 1091.40] they buy all metrics
[1091.40 → 1093.06] have reason to be bitter.
[1093.60 → 1095.32] They, like many Dutch immigrants,
[1095.42 → 1096.20] they lived through the war.
[1096.52 → 1097.30] They fled the war.
[1097.38 → 1097.98] They came to Canada.
[1098.12 → 1098.84] They started life.
[1098.90 → 1100.08] They had a lot of difficulty,
[1100.20 → 1100.90] a lot of poverty
[1100.90 → 1102.36] and financial challenges.
[1102.98 → 1103.86] And yet my pacha,
[1104.04 → 1105.46] who lived with our family
[1105.46 → 1106.70] on a farm for many years,
[1107.08 → 1108.14] he was one of the most content,
[1108.42 → 1109.38] joyful people I knew.
[1110.40 → 1111.10] And he was someone
[1111.10 → 1112.42] who could invite others
[1112.42 → 1112.98] into his home,
[1113.04 → 1113.80] even though he wasn't
[1113.80 → 1115.10] an extravagant or wealthy man.
[1115.18 → 1116.52] He was known for his hospitality.
[1116.84 → 1118.06] He could make anyone feel
[1118.06 → 1119.46] like they belonged in his home.
[1120.10 → 1120.82] He was the person
[1120.82 → 1121.64] who made a point
[1121.64 → 1122.78] of getting to know new people,
[1122.90 → 1124.22] talking to neighbours on the road.
[1124.38 → 1124.92] And as kids,
[1124.98 → 1125.48] we remember him
[1125.48 → 1126.44] getting down to our level,
[1126.72 → 1127.96] playing with us as kids,
[1128.28 → 1129.02] telling jokes,
[1129.38 → 1130.82] bringing us to fix farm equipment
[1130.82 → 1131.34] that he knew
[1131.34 → 1132.16] we'd be no help
[1132.16 → 1133.20] in fixing with him.
[1133.96 → 1134.94] And I think there's a man
[1134.94 → 1136.18] who has so much reason
[1136.18 → 1136.64] to be bitter.
[1137.64 → 1138.80] And perhaps there's some of us
[1138.80 → 1139.42] even this morning
[1139.42 → 1140.70] who've had a tough go in life
[1140.70 → 1142.28] and we feel reason to be bitter.
[1142.28 → 1144.60] And my pocket embodied
[1144.60 → 1145.80] the source of this prayer,
[1145.96 → 1146.20] saying,
[1146.96 → 1148.20] help us to be glad
[1148.20 → 1150.38] in spite of the affliction,
[1151.18 → 1152.26] in spite of the pain.
[1153.06 → 1154.54] Enable us to be joyful
[1154.54 → 1155.80] in a world
[1155.80 → 1157.04] that is marked with pain.
[1158.08 → 1159.94] That's Moses' second prayer.
[1161.24 → 1162.52] Prayer request number three.
[1163.56 → 1164.70] The request for God
[1164.70 → 1165.84] to reveal himself.
[1166.04 → 1167.10] We read in verse 16,
[1167.40 → 1168.52] may your deeds
[1168.52 → 1170.08] be shown to your servants
[1170.08 → 1171.72] your splendour.
[1172.28 → 1173.18] to their children.
[1174.94 → 1176.28] Now, I think that so much
[1176.28 → 1177.14] of Moses' faith
[1177.14 → 1178.30] was built on
[1178.30 → 1179.68] watching God be God.
[1180.36 → 1180.52] You know,
[1180.56 → 1181.60] if you read the book of Exodus,
[1181.76 → 1182.62] Moses got to witness
[1182.62 → 1184.04] some stunning things
[1184.04 → 1184.44] about God.
[1184.50 → 1185.40] Him showing up in Egypt,
[1185.56 → 1186.02] showing Pharaoh,
[1186.08 → 1186.58] who's boss,
[1186.86 → 1187.56] leading Israel
[1187.56 → 1188.88] through the Red Sea
[1188.88 → 1190.60] and totally destroying
[1190.60 → 1191.42] Pharaoh's army.
[1191.50 → 1192.02] He watched God
[1192.02 → 1192.90] lead them in the wilderness.
[1193.24 → 1194.92] He saw remarkable things.
[1195.34 → 1196.30] And the centre
[1196.30 → 1197.38] of this part of his prayer
[1197.38 → 1199.32] is simply saying to God,
[1199.32 → 1199.88] God,
[1199.96 → 1200.96] you've showed yourself
[1200.96 → 1201.58] in the past.
[1201.72 → 1202.78] I know who you are.
[1203.34 → 1204.38] Show yourself in the present.
[1205.82 → 1206.74] Reveal your deeds
[1206.74 → 1207.44] and your majesty
[1207.44 → 1208.30] and your splendour,
[1208.44 → 1209.50] not just to the people
[1209.50 → 1210.40] in front of me,
[1210.60 → 1211.06] he says,
[1211.20 → 1212.20] but to their children.
[1212.20 → 1214.76] I love that prayer.
[1215.78 → 1216.34] There's a piece of me
[1216.34 → 1216.62] that says,
[1216.72 → 1216.82] Lord,
[1216.90 → 1217.72] don't just reveal yourself
[1217.72 → 1218.30] to those of us
[1218.30 → 1218.76] who are here,
[1218.82 → 1219.40] who know you,
[1219.46 → 1220.06] who have learned
[1220.06 → 1220.82] to follow you,
[1221.00 → 1222.08] who believe in your goodness.
[1222.50 → 1223.12] Reveal yourself
[1223.12 → 1223.76] to our neighbours
[1223.76 → 1225.02] and to our children
[1225.02 → 1226.82] as that kind of good father.
[1228.34 → 1229.48] Reveal your splendour,
[1229.62 → 1230.18] your deeds,
[1230.28 → 1230.88] your majesty
[1230.88 → 1231.74] and your purposes
[1231.74 → 1233.26] to Georgia and Fay,
[1233.92 → 1235.18] to Alan and Timothy,
[1235.86 → 1237.70] to Grayson and Mason
[1237.70 → 1238.32] or Miles.
[1239.50 → 1241.10] Show them your goodness
[1241.10 → 1241.94] and your power.
[1242.20 → 1243.70] So they would take their place
[1243.70 → 1244.56] in your church
[1244.56 → 1245.82] and in your story
[1245.82 → 1247.04] and live faithfully
[1247.04 → 1247.96] with their lives
[1247.96 → 1248.78] that you've given them.
[1249.36 → 1250.40] That's his prayer request.
[1250.62 → 1252.22] May it be so in our church.
[1252.60 → 1253.40] That it's not just us
[1253.40 → 1253.82] who witness
[1253.82 → 1254.60] and see the deeds
[1254.60 → 1255.52] of God in Christ,
[1255.64 → 1256.46] but our children
[1256.46 → 1257.46] and their children
[1257.46 → 1258.18] as we prayed
[1258.18 → 1259.16] at the baptism.
[1261.74 → 1262.84] Request number four.
[1264.14 → 1265.84] Moses' final prayer request
[1265.84 → 1267.20] is a prayer for God's blessing.
[1267.34 → 1268.68] This is how Psalm 90 finishes.
[1269.42 → 1271.12] May the favour of the Lord
[1271.12 → 1272.94] God rest on us.
[1273.80 → 1274.80] Establishing the work
[1274.80 → 1276.32] of our hands for us.
[1276.52 → 1276.78] Yes,
[1277.48 → 1278.94] establish the work
[1278.94 → 1279.70] of our hands.
[1280.92 → 1281.72] He's praying,
[1282.04 → 1282.24] Lord,
[1282.50 → 1283.30] bless us
[1283.30 → 1285.10] and bless our work.
[1285.76 → 1286.46] May the work
[1286.46 → 1287.54] that we give ourselves to
[1287.54 → 1288.52] in the short life
[1288.52 → 1289.04] you've given us
[1289.04 → 1289.88] may be meaningful
[1289.88 → 1291.36] and have lasting impact
[1291.36 → 1292.52] and be a blessing.
[1293.00 → 1293.68] That's the prayer.
[1294.30 → 1294.92] And sort of built
[1294.92 → 1295.70] into that prayer,
[1295.80 → 1296.20] I would say,
[1296.28 → 1297.42] is not just asking God
[1297.42 → 1298.32] to already bless
[1298.32 → 1298.96] what you already
[1298.96 → 1299.96] happen to be doing,
[1300.52 → 1301.18] but for us
[1301.18 → 1302.24] to have the discernment
[1302.24 → 1304.00] to see work
[1304.00 → 1304.88] that is worth doing,
[1305.60 → 1306.86] work that matters,
[1307.22 → 1308.08] work that will be
[1308.08 → 1309.52] of lasting value
[1309.52 → 1310.56] in God's eyes
[1310.56 → 1311.46] and in God's kingdom.
[1312.80 → 1313.02] You know,
[1313.06 → 1313.42] I was thinking
[1313.42 → 1314.44] specifically this morning
[1314.44 → 1314.92] of students
[1314.92 → 1315.52] who are graduating
[1315.52 → 1315.98] high school,
[1316.04 → 1316.52] and we have a number
[1316.52 → 1317.32] of them in our church,
[1317.80 → 1318.90] going off to university.
[1319.88 → 1320.42] And the prayer
[1320.42 → 1321.42] that emerges for me
[1321.42 → 1322.10] from Psalm 90
[1322.10 → 1322.76] for our students
[1322.76 → 1323.56] is that they have
[1323.56 → 1324.56] the eyes to see
[1324.56 → 1325.44] and the discernment
[1325.44 → 1326.76] to cut through
[1326.76 → 1329.56] all the idolatrous pulls
[1329.56 → 1330.58] to take jobs
[1330.58 → 1331.72] and study subjects
[1331.72 → 1332.58] that are for the sake
[1332.58 → 1333.22] of status,
[1333.76 → 1334.14] power,
[1334.48 → 1335.34] and wealth.
[1336.42 → 1338.28] That is such a strong pull
[1338.28 → 1339.30] in the university
[1339.30 → 1340.74] for us to find something
[1340.74 → 1341.74] that will be of status
[1341.74 → 1343.12] and make us look good
[1343.12 → 1344.10] in the eyes of our neighbours.
[1344.26 → 1344.58] And I say,
[1344.66 → 1344.82] Lord,
[1344.88 → 1345.50] if Psalm 90
[1345.50 → 1346.60] is saying truth,
[1347.38 → 1348.18] help us to do
[1348.18 → 1349.52] not just what is powerful
[1349.52 → 1350.32] or prestigious
[1350.32 → 1351.52] or gives us lots of followers,
[1351.84 → 1353.00] but meaningful
[1353.00 → 1355.30] for the kingdom of God.
[1355.98 → 1357.30] And the good news is
[1357.30 → 1358.84] anything,
[1359.32 → 1360.66] with a few exceptions,
[1361.62 → 1362.60] can be made meaningful.
[1363.58 → 1363.84] Your,
[1363.98 → 1364.78] what you might think
[1364.78 → 1365.54] as menial,
[1365.76 → 1366.60] unseen job
[1366.60 → 1367.12] in the cubicle
[1367.12 → 1368.20] can be transformed
[1368.20 → 1369.18] as you seek
[1369.18 → 1370.22] to serve God with it.
[1370.96 → 1371.86] Your unseen work
[1371.86 → 1372.86] changing diapers
[1372.86 → 1374.42] in the public washroom
[1374.42 → 1375.54] is meaningful
[1375.54 → 1376.50] as we seek
[1376.50 → 1377.12] to raise children
[1377.12 → 1377.78] who know God
[1377.78 → 1378.54] in and through it
[1378.54 → 1379.44] in that care of love.
[1380.62 → 1381.62] We want to be people
[1381.62 → 1381.94] who say,
[1382.06 → 1382.14] Lord,
[1382.22 → 1382.88] life is short,
[1383.66 → 1384.74] make our work
[1384.74 → 1385.80] meaningful.
[1387.44 → 1388.08] And so to summarize,
[1388.30 → 1388.84] Psalm 90
[1388.84 → 1389.44] is the prayer
[1389.44 → 1390.20] of an old man
[1390.20 → 1391.00] who has suffered.
[1391.96 → 1393.18] It's an honest prayer
[1393.18 → 1394.10] of a man who says,
[1394.34 → 1394.62] life, Lord,
[1394.70 → 1395.28] is short
[1395.28 → 1397.42] and life is terribly difficult.
[1398.54 → 1399.88] So would you give me
[1399.88 → 1400.58] a heart of wisdom?
[1401.40 → 1402.70] Would you give us
[1402.70 → 1404.10] a sense of how short
[1404.10 → 1404.94] our days are?
[1405.56 → 1406.52] Would you show
[1406.52 → 1407.24] your deeds
[1407.24 → 1408.04] and your majesty
[1408.04 → 1408.92] and your purposes
[1408.92 → 1409.82] to us
[1409.82 → 1411.26] and would you bless us
[1411.26 → 1412.90] and help us
[1412.90 → 1413.60] to enjoy
[1413.60 → 1414.70] the life we have?
[1415.64 → 1416.48] That's the essence
[1416.48 → 1417.18] of Psalm 90.
[1418.96 → 1420.16] And I want to finish
[1420.16 → 1422.06] by naming a reality
[1422.06 → 1422.70] that I've been thinking
[1422.70 → 1423.78] about as I prepare
[1423.78 → 1424.58] this sermon.
[1425.98 → 1427.00] There is coming a day,
[1427.06 → 1427.56] this is going to get
[1427.56 → 1428.34] really sobering,
[1428.88 → 1429.58] there is coming a day
[1429.58 → 1430.26] where you and me,
[1430.42 → 1431.18] we're going to die.
[1431.94 → 1432.84] You know that, right?
[1432.84 → 1435.76] And after that day,
[1435.92 → 1437.06] the Bible tells us
[1437.06 → 1438.06] we are going
[1438.06 → 1438.96] to meet Jesus.
[1439.98 → 1440.86] We're going to stand
[1440.86 → 1441.56] before Jesus,
[1441.70 → 1442.26] our Saviour,
[1442.80 → 1443.46] our Lord,
[1443.82 → 1445.20] and our Judge.
[1445.86 → 1446.80] And we will be giving
[1446.80 → 1447.42] an account
[1447.42 → 1448.60] of the life
[1448.60 → 1449.28] He gave us.
[1449.48 → 1450.04] Do you know this?
[1450.72 → 1451.40] I know we don't think
[1451.40 → 1452.06] about this very often,
[1452.12 → 1453.02] but that day will come.
[1453.40 → 1454.34] If the Scriptures are
[1454.34 → 1454.92] what we believe
[1454.92 → 1455.52] to be true,
[1455.86 → 1456.94] we will see Jesus
[1456.94 → 1457.78] and we will give
[1457.78 → 1458.62] an account of our lives.
[1458.66 → 1459.20] And here's what
[1459.20 → 1460.48] He will not be concerned with.
[1460.86 → 1461.78] Hear this for all it's worth.
[1461.78 → 1463.14] He will not ask you
[1463.14 → 1464.66] the lucrative title
[1464.66 → 1465.68] of your job.
[1466.74 → 1467.46] He won't.
[1468.14 → 1469.12] He will not ask you
[1469.12 → 1469.88] the square footage
[1469.88 → 1470.58] of your beautifully
[1470.58 → 1471.48] manicured home.
[1472.16 → 1473.62] That will not be His concern.
[1474.34 → 1475.36] He will not ask you
[1475.36 → 1476.68] how many followers
[1476.68 → 1478.50] did you have on Instagram.
[1478.96 → 1480.40] That will not be His concern.
[1481.46 → 1482.82] And nor will He ask you
[1482.82 → 1483.86] how much money
[1483.86 → 1484.44] did you have
[1484.44 → 1485.28] in your bank account
[1485.28 → 1486.42] at your death.
[1487.38 → 1488.70] Those are not the concerns
[1488.70 → 1489.20] of the kingdom.
[1489.80 → 1491.06] The question that Matthew
[1491.06 → 1491.64] would tell you
[1491.64 → 1492.66] to us that matters
[1492.66 → 1493.30] most to Jesus
[1493.30 → 1493.98] is this,
[1494.46 → 1495.10] were you faithful?
[1496.62 → 1497.80] Were you faithful
[1497.80 → 1499.74] with the life I gave you?
[1500.62 → 1501.40] Were you faithful
[1501.40 → 1502.06] with the breath,
[1502.28 → 1502.76] the energy,
[1502.90 → 1503.44] the time,
[1503.54 → 1503.92] and the talents
[1503.92 → 1505.40] that I, the Lord,
[1505.62 → 1506.52] gave you
[1506.52 → 1507.80] specifically
[1507.80 → 1509.10] to serve,
[1509.38 → 1509.90] to love,
[1510.06 → 1510.96] and to bless?
[1512.06 → 1512.82] Were you faithful?
[1513.78 → 1514.50] And my prayer
[1514.50 → 1515.70] for every single person
[1515.70 → 1516.26] in this church,
[1516.36 → 1517.54] even children yet to be born,
[1517.74 → 1518.44] is the words
[1518.44 → 1518.88] that we hear
[1518.88 → 1519.44] from Jesus,
[1519.56 → 1520.06] our Saviour,
[1520.54 → 1521.30] and our Judge,
[1521.96 → 1522.92] are well done,
[1523.66 → 1524.88] good and faithful servant.
[1525.62 → 1526.86] You may enter my kingdom.
[1528.86 → 1529.64] I want to finish
[1529.64 → 1530.46] by reading lyrics
[1530.46 → 1531.44] from a song
[1531.44 → 1532.34] by Robin Mark.
[1532.34 → 1535.72] This is a song called
[1535.72 → 1536.48] When It's All Been Said
[1536.48 → 1536.76] and Done.
[1536.82 → 1537.72] Maybe you've heard it before.
[1538.74 → 1539.82] But I love the balance
[1539.82 → 1541.42] of grace and response
[1541.42 → 1542.38] in these words.
[1542.50 → 1542.90] He writes,
[1543.00 → 1544.02] When it's all been said
[1544.02 → 1544.52] and done,
[1545.08 → 1545.84] there is just
[1545.84 → 1546.94] one thing
[1546.94 → 1547.86] that matters.
[1548.72 → 1550.16] Did I do my best
[1550.16 → 1551.30] to live for truth?
[1552.08 → 1553.58] Did I live my life
[1553.58 → 1554.68] for you?
[1555.62 → 1556.88] When it's all been said
[1556.88 → 1557.40] and done,
[1557.40 → 1559.10] all my treasures
[1559.10 → 1560.14] will mean nothing.
[1561.08 → 1562.40] Only what I've done
[1562.40 → 1564.08] for love's reward
[1564.08 → 1566.16] will stand the test of time.
[1567.18 → 1568.12] And here's the chorus.
[1568.70 → 1569.60] Lord, your mercy
[1569.60 → 1571.00] is so great
[1571.00 → 1572.96] that you look beyond
[1572.96 → 1573.68] our weakness
[1573.68 → 1576.72] and find the purest gold
[1576.72 → 1578.36] in miry clay
[1578.36 → 1580.10] turning sinners
[1580.10 → 1581.98] into saints.
[1583.24 → 1583.68] Hallelujah.
[1584.68 → 1585.46] Let's pray.
[1587.40 → 1592.18] Father, we thank you
[1592.18 → 1593.02] for Psalm 90.
[1594.18 → 1594.78] And we pray
[1594.78 → 1595.56] that we have ears
[1595.56 → 1596.08] to hear
[1596.08 → 1597.20] that life is short
[1597.20 → 1598.60] and life is hard.
[1599.38 → 1600.30] And we echo
[1600.30 → 1601.10] Moses' prayer
[1601.10 → 1601.68] in our day.
[1601.76 → 1602.58] Would you give us
[1602.58 → 1603.40] a heart of wisdom?
[1604.26 → 1605.08] Would you teach us
[1605.08 → 1605.78] young and old
[1605.78 → 1607.40] to number our days?
[1608.30 → 1608.90] Would you,
[1609.06 → 1609.58] in your grace,
[1609.68 → 1611.02] help us to enjoy
[1611.02 → 1612.86] this life
[1612.86 → 1614.82] in spite of affliction
[1614.82 → 1615.82] and pain?
[1615.82 → 1618.64] Would you enable us,
[1618.92 → 1619.14] Lord,
[1619.56 → 1621.06] to be a blessing?
[1622.08 → 1623.32] And would you establish
[1623.32 → 1624.60] the work of our hands,
[1625.26 → 1626.08] all the seen
[1626.08 → 1626.98] and unseen work
[1626.98 → 1627.34] we do
[1627.34 → 1628.46] from Monday to Friday.
[1629.12 → 1630.20] Use it for your kingdom.
[1630.92 → 1631.62] We pray this
[1631.62 → 1632.28] in the mighty name
[1632.28 → 1632.68] of Jesus.
[1633.32 → 1633.58] Amen.
[1635.84 → 1636.84] We're going to stand
[1636.84 → 1638.24] and sing a new song.
[1638.48 → 1639.60] It's based right off
[1639.60 → 1640.20] Psalm 90.
[1640.20 → 1644.58] When it was introduced
[1644.58 → 1645.30] to me by David,
[1645.36 → 1646.08] I'd never heard it before.
[1646.16 → 1646.34] I thought,
[1646.42 → 1646.94] this is perfect.
[1647.04 → 1647.72] So we're going to learn it.
[1647.78 → 1648.32] We're going to sing it.
[1648.38 → 1649.04] It's very singable.
[1649.40 → 1650.78] Let's sing Psalm 90 together.
[1650.78 → 1650.82] Let's sing Psalm 90 together.
[1650.82 → 1659.88] filled with tang Well,
[1659.96 → 1660.98] and I'll turn to anyone
[1661.06 → 1662.08] to pray.
[1663.68 → 1665.10] luck with your endorsement
[1665.10 → 1666.30] and first Namib
[1666.34 → 1667.50] our single name
[1667.64 → 1668.80] will turn touch
[1669.00 → 1669.34] Hey Aww God.
[1670.14 → 1670.70] I appreciate it.
[1670.70 → 1670.84] Great.
[1671.32 → 1672.58] And I got to
[1672.60 → 1673.10] give up
[1674.02 → 1675.52] all the songs
[1675.66 → 1676.42] it's been
[1676.52 → 1677.68] coming
[1678.12 → 1678.38] Let's sing
