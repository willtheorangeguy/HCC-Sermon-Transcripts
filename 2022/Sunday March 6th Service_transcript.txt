[0.90 --> 3.50]  Well, thanks Marie, no pressure, my goodness gracious.
[5.36 --> 8.74]  I will say it's a privilege to be able to preach on this passage.
[9.54 --> 12.94]  And I'll say in advance, it's one of those passages that's very moving to me
[12.94 --> 15.60]  because the last time I preached on it was at a funeral of a friend of mine.
[17.50 --> 21.40]  Over the next six weeks, we're going to be looking at the next section in the Gospel of John.
[21.50 --> 27.50]  And it starts with the prologue, and then chapter 2 to 12 is basically the storytelling of Jesus' ministry.
[27.50 --> 33.74]  What he did, the miracles he performed in chapter 13 to chapter 20 is sort of a slowdown of the whole story
[33.74 --> 35.78]  where Jesus is in the upper room with his disciples.
[36.00 --> 36.92]  He's washing their feet.
[37.46 --> 38.78]  He's teaching them about the kingdom.
[39.02 --> 40.28]  He's preparing them for leaving.
[40.40 --> 41.42]  He's breaking bread with them.
[41.98 --> 43.52]  And that's where we're going to be going for Lent.
[44.16 --> 47.44]  But this morning, I'm preaching on John 11 because we're behind in our sermon series,
[47.62 --> 49.24]  and I just can't not preach on this passage.
[49.42 --> 52.86]  So if you have your Bible, turn with me to John chapter 11.
[53.20 --> 55.64]  This is Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead.
[57.50 --> 66.96]  We're going to read the whole passage.
[67.08 --> 68.12]  This is a bit of a longer one.
[69.78 --> 71.86]  Now, a man named Lazarus was sick.
[72.38 --> 75.32]  He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and Martha, her sister.
[76.20 --> 78.86]  This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick,
[78.92 --> 82.30]  was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.
[82.30 --> 84.84]  So the sister sent word to Jesus,
[85.18 --> 87.28]  Lord, the one you love is sick.
[88.24 --> 89.92]  When Jesus heard this, he said,
[90.16 --> 91.48]  This sickness will not end in death.
[92.22 --> 95.98]  No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it.
[96.86 --> 100.56]  Now, Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
[100.98 --> 104.84]  So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.
[104.84 --> 106.32]  And then he said to his disciples,
[107.00 --> 108.16]  Let's go back to Judea.
[109.10 --> 110.16]  But Rabbi, they said,
[110.26 --> 112.92]  A short while ago, the Jews there tried to stone you,
[113.42 --> 114.76]  and yet you were going back?
[115.86 --> 116.60]  Jesus answered,
[117.02 --> 118.64]  Are there not twelve hours in a day?
[119.08 --> 120.90]  Those who walk in the daytime will not stumble,
[121.06 --> 122.50]  for they see by the world's light.
[123.04 --> 125.24]  It is when people walk at night that they stumble,
[125.76 --> 126.82]  for they have no light.
[127.96 --> 129.80]  After he had said this, he went on to tell them,
[129.88 --> 131.52]  Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep,
[132.06 --> 134.02]  but I am going there to wake him up.
[135.02 --> 136.10]  His disciples replied,
[136.24 --> 137.54]  Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.
[138.40 --> 139.80]  Jesus had been speaking of his death,
[139.90 --> 141.84]  but his disciples thought he had meant natural sleep.
[142.18 --> 143.58]  So then he told them plainly,
[144.22 --> 145.10]  Lazarus is dead,
[145.70 --> 148.00]  and for your sake I am glad I was not there,
[148.20 --> 150.08]  so that you may believe.
[150.96 --> 151.78]  Let's go to him.
[152.68 --> 154.24]  Then Thomas, also known as Didymus,
[154.54 --> 155.66]  said to the rest of the disciples,
[155.66 --> 157.68]  Let us also go, that we may die with him.
[159.08 --> 159.94]  On his arrival,
[160.06 --> 162.42]  Jesus found that Lazarus had already been dead in the tomb
[162.42 --> 163.42]  for four days.
[164.02 --> 166.42]  Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,
[166.56 --> 168.38]  and many Jews had come to Mary and Martha
[168.38 --> 170.18]  to comfort them in their loss of their brother.
[171.18 --> 172.80]  When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,
[172.88 --> 173.82]  she went out to meet him,
[174.34 --> 175.18]  but Mary stayed home.
[176.24 --> 177.76]  Lord, Martha said to Jesus,
[177.90 --> 179.12]  If you had been here,
[179.60 --> 180.86]  my brother would not have died,
[181.74 --> 183.20]  but I know that even now,
[183.32 --> 184.78]  God will give you whatever you ask.
[186.00 --> 186.80]  Jesus said to her,
[186.88 --> 188.88]  Your brother will rise again.
[188.88 --> 190.84]  Martha answered,
[191.04 --> 192.28]  I know he will rise again
[192.28 --> 194.26]  in the resurrection at that last day.
[195.44 --> 196.22]  Jesus said to her,
[196.28 --> 198.56]  I am the resurrection and the life.
[198.74 --> 200.14]  Anyone who believes in me
[200.14 --> 202.10]  will live even though they die,
[202.36 --> 204.36]  and whoever lives by believing in me
[204.36 --> 205.60]  will never die.
[206.42 --> 207.70]  Do you believe this?
[208.82 --> 210.30]  Yes, Lord, she told him.
[210.46 --> 211.98]  I believe that you are the Messiah,
[212.08 --> 212.86]  the Son of God,
[212.92 --> 214.40]  who is to come into the world.
[214.40 --> 216.34]  After she said this,
[216.38 --> 218.60]  she went back and called her sister Mary aside.
[219.14 --> 220.62]  The teacher is here, she said,
[220.92 --> 222.24]  and is asking for you.
[223.04 --> 223.70]  When Mary heard this,
[223.72 --> 225.06]  she got up quickly and went to him.
[225.54 --> 227.46]  Now Jesus had not yet entered the village,
[227.54 --> 228.60]  but was still at the place
[228.60 --> 229.96]  where Martha had met him.
[230.60 --> 231.96]  When the Jews who had been with Mary
[231.96 --> 233.02]  in the house comforting her
[233.02 --> 234.48]  noticed how quickly she got up
[234.48 --> 234.90]  and went out,
[234.96 --> 235.70]  they followed her,
[235.96 --> 237.30]  supposing she was going to the tomb
[237.30 --> 238.02]  to mourn there.
[239.04 --> 240.38]  When Mary reached the place
[240.38 --> 241.98]  where Jesus was and saw him,
[242.74 --> 244.12]  she fell at his feet and said,
[244.12 --> 246.24]  Lord, if you had been here,
[246.80 --> 248.20]  my brother would not have died.
[249.62 --> 251.32]  When Jesus saw her weeping
[251.32 --> 253.66]  and the Jews who had come along with her
[253.66 --> 254.42]  also weeping,
[254.88 --> 256.64]  he was deeply moved in spirit
[256.64 --> 257.60]  and troubled.
[259.08 --> 260.22]  Where have you laid him?
[260.36 --> 260.88]  He asked.
[261.76 --> 263.46]  Come and see, Lord, they replied.
[264.82 --> 265.50]  Jesus wept.
[267.04 --> 268.06]  Then the Jews said,
[268.16 --> 269.42]  See how he loved him.
[270.46 --> 271.52]  But some of them said,
[271.94 --> 273.62]  Could not he who opened the eyes
[273.62 --> 274.16]  of the blind
[274.16 --> 276.06]  have kept this man from dying?
[277.64 --> 278.66]  Jesus once more,
[278.78 --> 279.40]  deeply moved,
[279.48 --> 280.30]  came to the tomb.
[281.06 --> 282.24]  It was a cave with a stone
[282.24 --> 283.54]  laid across the entrance.
[284.52 --> 286.04]  Take away the stone, he said.
[286.88 --> 288.32]  But Lord, said Martha,
[288.52 --> 289.70]  the sister of the dead man,
[289.94 --> 291.68]  by this time there is a bad odor
[291.68 --> 293.60]  for he has been there for four days.
[294.60 --> 295.36]  And Jesus said,
[295.42 --> 296.14]  Did I not tell you
[296.14 --> 297.06]  that if you believe
[297.06 --> 298.80]  you will see the glory of God?
[298.80 --> 300.86]  So they took away the stone.
[301.68 --> 303.08]  And then Jesus looked up and said,
[303.24 --> 303.50]  Father,
[303.86 --> 305.34]  I thank you that you have heard me.
[306.12 --> 307.88]  I knew that you always hear me.
[308.30 --> 309.76]  But I said this for the benefit
[309.76 --> 311.48]  of the people standing here,
[311.54 --> 313.08]  that they may believe
[313.08 --> 314.02]  that you sent me.
[315.18 --> 316.22]  When he had said this,
[316.34 --> 317.26]  Jesus called out
[317.26 --> 318.56]  in a loud voice,
[319.16 --> 319.88]  Lazarus,
[320.38 --> 321.14]  come out.
[321.14 --> 323.88]  The dead man came out,
[324.72 --> 325.60]  his hands and feet
[325.60 --> 327.06]  wrapped with strips of linen
[327.06 --> 328.88]  and a cloth around his face.
[329.92 --> 330.68]  Jesus said to them,
[330.84 --> 332.00]  Take off the grave clothes
[332.00 --> 333.46]  and let him go.
[338.62 --> 339.84]  I feel like that passage
[339.84 --> 340.70]  preaches itself.
[343.04 --> 344.32]  If you were here last week,
[344.36 --> 345.08]  you'll remember that
[345.08 --> 346.04]  we looked at Jesus
[346.04 --> 346.96]  telling the story
[346.96 --> 348.18]  of being the good shepherd.
[349.18 --> 349.86]  And in that sermon,
[349.98 --> 350.52]  I referenced that
[350.52 --> 351.48]  I grew up on a sheep farm
[351.48 --> 353.30]  and that I remember my dad
[353.30 --> 354.02]  having to go out
[354.02 --> 354.80]  and protect the sheep
[354.80 --> 355.68]  from being attacked
[355.68 --> 357.26]  and killed by wild animals
[357.26 --> 358.88]  and having to extinguish
[358.88 --> 359.48]  those animals
[359.48 --> 360.72]  with a particular weapon.
[361.94 --> 363.18]  The next morning,
[363.32 --> 363.80]  Brittany and I
[363.80 --> 364.86]  were sitting in our home.
[365.40 --> 366.44]  We were up before the kids
[366.44 --> 367.44]  and our youngest daughter,
[367.52 --> 367.90]  Rosalie,
[368.04 --> 369.28]  plunks herself down between us.
[369.44 --> 370.64]  And the first question
[370.64 --> 372.08]  she asks us is,
[372.72 --> 373.90]  What do sheep look like
[373.90 --> 374.52]  when they die?
[376.56 --> 377.14]  And we're like,
[377.20 --> 377.70]  Wow, Rosalie,
[377.78 --> 378.52]  way to start the day.
[379.10 --> 380.22]  Then she ramped it up.
[380.22 --> 380.56]  She says,
[380.66 --> 382.12]  What will I look like
[382.12 --> 382.84]  when I die?
[383.34 --> 383.72]  Like, well,
[383.72 --> 384.64]  this is getting morbid fast.
[384.70 --> 385.40]  And she started asking
[385.40 --> 386.34]  all sorts of questions
[386.34 --> 386.98]  about death
[386.98 --> 388.26]  and when she's going to die.
[388.34 --> 388.96]  And it's at this point
[388.96 --> 389.50]  that Brittany and I
[389.50 --> 390.08]  look at each other
[390.08 --> 390.34]  and we're like,
[390.64 --> 392.22]  Why wasn't she in Cornerstone
[392.22 --> 393.18]  last Sunday morning?
[394.06 --> 395.10]  And so we had
[395.10 --> 396.42]  a four-year-old conversation
[396.42 --> 397.08]  about death
[397.08 --> 397.94]  and dying
[397.94 --> 398.58]  and sheep
[398.58 --> 399.30]  and us
[399.30 --> 400.74]  and our hope in Jesus.
[401.74 --> 402.06]  Of course,
[402.14 --> 402.78]  Rosie went off
[402.78 --> 403.28]  and played
[403.28 --> 404.48]  and we sort of sat there
[404.48 --> 405.14]  with our coffee
[405.14 --> 405.84]  and I couldn't help
[405.84 --> 406.34]  but just think
[406.34 --> 407.58]  of the strangeness
[407.58 --> 408.06]  of death.
[409.34 --> 410.64]  How we all know
[410.64 --> 411.78]  it's coming for us,
[411.94 --> 412.20]  right?
[412.30 --> 413.08]  We know that it's going
[413.08 --> 413.48]  to happen.
[414.26 --> 415.54]  We know we can't avoid it.
[415.68 --> 416.06]  We don't know
[416.06 --> 416.88]  when it's going to happen
[416.88 --> 417.80]  but it will happen.
[417.90 --> 419.00]  We cannot avoid
[419.00 --> 420.78]  the enemy of death
[420.78 --> 422.38]  and it is an enemy.
[424.62 --> 425.34]  John 11
[425.34 --> 426.62]  is one of those passages
[426.62 --> 427.42]  that brings us
[427.42 --> 428.88]  right into the center
[428.88 --> 429.82]  of the grief
[429.82 --> 430.78]  around death
[430.78 --> 431.26]  and dying.
[432.02 --> 432.26]  In fact,
[432.30 --> 432.76]  if you look at
[432.76 --> 433.40]  this story
[433.40 --> 434.66]  John tells
[434.66 --> 435.22]  and compare it
[435.22 --> 435.76]  to all the other
[435.76 --> 437.20]  miracles John narrates,
[437.46 --> 438.24]  this one's told
[438.24 --> 439.22]  in slow motion.
[439.68 --> 440.30]  Like it brings you
[440.30 --> 441.54]  right into Martha's pain,
[441.70 --> 442.72]  right into Mary's pain
[442.72 --> 443.34]  and right into
[443.34 --> 444.70]  Jesus' grief,
[444.86 --> 446.40]  right into Jesus' tears.
[447.74 --> 448.74]  But it's also a passage
[448.74 --> 449.90]  where John brings us
[449.90 --> 450.46]  to one of the most
[450.46 --> 450.96]  beautiful,
[451.56 --> 452.08]  powerful
[452.08 --> 453.06]  and audacious
[453.06 --> 453.98]  I am statements
[453.98 --> 454.88]  that Jesus makes.
[455.66 --> 456.56]  Because it doesn't just
[456.56 --> 457.10]  bring his tears
[457.10 --> 457.64]  to the tomb
[457.64 --> 458.50]  or even his anger
[458.50 --> 459.02]  over death,
[459.36 --> 460.44]  Jesus brings resurrection.
[461.26 --> 462.80]  He brings new life
[462.80 --> 463.36]  to places
[463.36 --> 463.98]  where death
[463.98 --> 464.88]  takes place.
[465.40 --> 466.14]  And John wants us
[466.14 --> 467.30]  to see this is
[467.30 --> 468.10]  who Jesus is,
[468.14 --> 468.90]  the resurrection
[468.90 --> 470.40]  and the life.
[471.94 --> 472.72]  Now this story
[472.72 --> 473.40]  sort of has three
[473.40 --> 474.02]  scenes to it.
[474.12 --> 474.68]  Scene one
[474.68 --> 475.94]  is Jesus receiving
[475.94 --> 476.78]  word from Mary
[476.78 --> 477.20]  and Martha
[477.20 --> 477.86]  about the sickness
[477.86 --> 478.92]  of Lazarus.
[479.62 --> 480.08]  Scene two
[480.08 --> 480.78]  is Jesus going
[480.78 --> 481.34]  to the home
[481.34 --> 482.26]  of Martha and Mary
[482.26 --> 483.28]  and joining their grief
[483.28 --> 484.28]  and then scene three
[484.28 --> 485.02]  is Jesus then
[485.02 --> 485.80]  going to the tomb
[485.80 --> 486.62]  to do something
[486.62 --> 487.94]  about this tragedy.
[488.86 --> 489.84]  The story starts
[489.84 --> 490.58]  with scene one
[490.58 --> 491.28]  of Jesus doing
[491.28 --> 491.98]  ministry with his
[491.98 --> 492.40]  disciples
[492.40 --> 494.02]  and Mary and Martha
[494.02 --> 495.22]  who have a brother
[495.22 --> 495.76]  Lazarus
[495.76 --> 496.66]  who Jesus knows
[496.66 --> 497.10]  and loves
[497.10 --> 497.78]  they send word
[497.78 --> 498.26]  to Jesus
[498.26 --> 499.18]  saying you got
[499.18 --> 499.74]  to come here
[499.74 --> 500.34]  right away.
[500.98 --> 501.34]  Lazarus,
[501.64 --> 502.18]  my brother,
[502.30 --> 503.28]  our brother is sick.
[503.54 --> 504.60]  You need to do something.
[505.32 --> 505.90]  So this is urgent,
[506.02 --> 506.16]  right?
[506.24 --> 506.84]  This is not just
[506.84 --> 507.22]  some hate.
[507.34 --> 508.12]  You need to be aware
[508.12 --> 508.36]  of this.
[508.42 --> 509.04]  It's like come here.
[509.38 --> 510.16]  You got to come here
[510.16 --> 510.58]  because he's going
[510.58 --> 511.02]  to die.
[512.28 --> 513.58]  And Jesus' response
[513.58 --> 514.40]  to Mary and Martha
[514.40 --> 515.12]  is one of the most
[515.12 --> 515.96]  perplexing parts
[515.96 --> 516.56]  of this passage
[516.56 --> 517.66]  because first he says
[517.66 --> 517.98]  word,
[518.08 --> 518.80]  we don't know exactly
[518.80 --> 519.48]  what word he sent
[519.48 --> 520.16]  or how it was received
[520.16 --> 520.64]  but he says
[520.64 --> 521.46]  this sickness
[521.46 --> 522.08]  isn't going to end
[522.08 --> 522.44]  in death.
[523.48 --> 523.98]  It's going to end
[523.98 --> 524.80]  in God's glory
[524.80 --> 525.58]  and the glory
[525.58 --> 526.26]  of the Son.
[528.14 --> 528.54]  And then
[528.54 --> 529.50]  we're told
[529.50 --> 530.30]  that he sticks around
[530.30 --> 531.12]  for two more days
[531.12 --> 531.68]  in that city.
[532.58 --> 533.26]  And I can imagine
[533.26 --> 534.08]  Martha and Mary
[534.08 --> 534.90]  receiving this word
[534.90 --> 535.40]  thinking like
[535.40 --> 536.22]  what do you take us
[536.22 --> 536.70]  for Jesus?
[536.80 --> 537.56]  We sent word to you
[537.56 --> 538.38]  because this is urgent.
[538.50 --> 539.08]  We sent word to you
[539.08 --> 539.56]  because we think
[539.56 --> 540.16]  Lazarus is going
[540.16 --> 540.70]  to die soon
[540.70 --> 541.82]  and you just stick around
[541.82 --> 542.66]  for two more days
[542.66 --> 543.40]  doing your ministry
[543.40 --> 544.32]  and you don't respond
[544.32 --> 544.78]  to us?
[545.26 --> 546.36]  What do you take us for?
[547.34 --> 548.32]  But more perplexing
[548.32 --> 548.80]  than that
[548.80 --> 549.36]  then Jesus
[549.36 --> 550.24]  after two days
[550.24 --> 551.12]  of just being there
[551.12 --> 551.90]  he then turns
[551.90 --> 552.46]  to his disciples
[552.46 --> 552.78]  and he said
[552.78 --> 553.08]  you know what
[553.08 --> 553.48]  we're going to do?
[553.54 --> 554.42]  Let's go to Judea.
[555.54 --> 556.42]  And the disciples
[556.42 --> 557.00]  are like whoa,
[557.12 --> 557.56]  whoa, whoa.
[558.58 --> 559.90]  We know that Lazarus
[559.90 --> 560.66]  is sick in Bethany.
[560.78 --> 561.96]  You love this man.
[562.02 --> 563.24]  He's close to you
[563.24 --> 563.96]  and now you want
[563.96 --> 565.02]  to go to Judea
[565.02 --> 565.98]  instead the place
[565.98 --> 567.52]  where last we were in
[567.52 --> 568.80]  people picked up stones
[568.80 --> 569.88]  to throw them at you
[569.88 --> 570.86]  to kill you.
[571.72 --> 572.82]  What gives Jesus?
[572.82 --> 575.82]  And then Jesus
[575.82 --> 576.78]  puts it to them straight.
[576.90 --> 577.40]  He probably says
[577.40 --> 577.96]  something that they
[577.96 --> 578.68]  didn't even know yet.
[578.76 --> 580.08]  He says our friend
[580.08 --> 581.90]  Lazarus is dead.
[582.80 --> 583.08]  And he says
[583.08 --> 583.78]  and I'm glad
[583.78 --> 584.66]  I wasn't there
[584.66 --> 586.56]  because this is for you
[586.56 --> 587.32]  to believe
[587.32 --> 588.04]  so let's go
[588.04 --> 588.52]  and this is where
[588.52 --> 589.26]  we get the scene two.
[590.24 --> 591.02]  Jesus shows up
[591.02 --> 591.72]  to come to Mary
[591.72 --> 592.42]  and Martha's place.
[592.74 --> 593.64]  He doesn't even get there
[593.64 --> 594.58]  and Martha shows up
[594.58 --> 595.60]  to meet him on the way
[595.60 --> 596.06]  and Martha
[596.06 --> 597.52]  you know in my opinion
[597.52 --> 598.42]  she gives him
[598.42 --> 599.00]  the full range
[599.00 --> 599.58]  of her emotion.
[599.86 --> 600.18]  She gives him
[600.18 --> 600.78]  her grief,
[601.04 --> 601.46]  her anger,
[601.60 --> 602.04]  her sorrow
[602.04 --> 603.24]  and her faith.
[604.20 --> 604.86]  She says to him
[604.86 --> 606.14]  Lord if you were here
[606.14 --> 607.34]  if you had gotten here
[607.34 --> 607.76]  in time
[607.76 --> 608.86]  my brother
[608.86 --> 609.72]  would not have died.
[610.98 --> 611.74]  Then she adds
[611.74 --> 612.58]  but I know
[612.58 --> 613.32]  even now
[613.32 --> 614.36]  God will give you
[614.36 --> 615.16]  whatever you ask.
[616.00 --> 616.48]  There's faith.
[617.50 --> 618.12]  And then Martha
[618.12 --> 618.76]  and Jesus
[618.76 --> 619.66]  enter into this
[619.66 --> 621.52]  fascinating conversation
[621.52 --> 622.38]  about resurrection.
[623.08 --> 624.02]  Jesus says to Martha
[624.02 --> 624.46]  Martha
[624.46 --> 626.44]  your brother will rise.
[627.20 --> 627.88]  I mean what a statement.
[628.92 --> 629.66]  And then Martha says
[629.66 --> 630.76]  I know that.
[630.76 --> 632.78]  I know that on the last day
[632.78 --> 634.04]  when God returns in glory
[634.04 --> 635.08]  he's going to rise
[635.08 --> 635.94]  and she's expressing
[635.94 --> 636.96]  the faith that many Jews
[636.96 --> 637.64]  had at that time
[637.64 --> 638.16]  that when God
[638.16 --> 638.92]  returned in glory
[638.92 --> 640.34]  he's going to overturn evil
[640.34 --> 641.08]  he's going to restore
[641.08 --> 641.50]  this world
[641.50 --> 642.20]  he's going to get rid
[642.20 --> 643.26]  of all that is destructive
[643.26 --> 644.28]  and he's going to raise
[644.28 --> 645.06]  people from the dead.
[645.68 --> 646.58]  And Martha's expressing
[646.58 --> 647.08]  that faith
[647.08 --> 647.72]  that deep faith
[647.72 --> 648.58]  that hope she has.
[649.24 --> 650.12]  And Jesus is like
[650.12 --> 651.08]  no I'm not talking
[651.08 --> 651.60]  about that.
[652.88 --> 654.10]  I am the resurrection.
[655.26 --> 656.40]  I want to read for you
[656.40 --> 657.60]  one of the most powerful
[657.60 --> 658.40]  statements he makes
[658.40 --> 659.00]  in his ministry
[659.00 --> 659.58]  and he says
[659.58 --> 660.32]  in verse 25
[660.32 --> 662.14]  I am the resurrection
[662.14 --> 663.22]  and the life.
[664.20 --> 665.44]  Anyone who believes
[665.44 --> 666.94]  in me will live
[666.94 --> 668.42]  even though they die
[668.42 --> 669.76]  and whoever lives
[669.76 --> 670.60]  by believing me
[670.60 --> 671.80]  will never die.
[671.90 --> 672.78]  And he turns to Martha
[672.78 --> 673.18]  and he says
[673.18 --> 674.36]  do you believe that Martha?
[675.50 --> 676.00]  Do you believe
[676.00 --> 676.58]  what I've just said
[676.58 --> 677.28]  about who I am?
[678.32 --> 679.02]  I could preach
[679.02 --> 679.54]  a whole sermon
[679.54 --> 680.94]  on just this statement
[680.94 --> 682.96]  but suffice it to say
[682.96 --> 684.08]  that Jesus completely
[684.08 --> 684.98]  turns everything
[684.98 --> 685.52]  she believes
[685.52 --> 686.06]  about resurrection
[686.06 --> 686.88]  on its head.
[687.26 --> 688.52]  It's not just a doctrine.
[689.20 --> 689.98]  It's not just a teaching
[689.98 --> 691.10]  that people had
[691.10 --> 692.80]  nor is it just an event
[692.80 --> 693.62]  that's going to happen
[693.62 --> 694.36]  in the future
[694.36 --> 695.40]  when God returns
[695.40 --> 696.32]  to restore all things.
[696.62 --> 697.16]  For Jesus
[697.16 --> 699.26]  resurrection is a person.
[700.52 --> 701.66]  Resurrection has a face
[701.66 --> 702.68]  and a name
[702.68 --> 703.46]  and it's Jesus.
[704.32 --> 705.40]  And this is very deep
[705.40 --> 705.86]  and profound.
[706.20 --> 707.70]  What Jesus is helping Martha see
[707.70 --> 708.48]  is that he is
[708.48 --> 709.56]  the resurrection life
[709.56 --> 710.56]  that will one day
[710.56 --> 711.04]  fill the earth
[711.04 --> 711.72]  that is broken
[711.72 --> 712.76]  into the present
[712.76 --> 714.48]  and he's standing
[714.48 --> 715.88]  in front of her.
[717.04 --> 718.60]  I'm the resurrection Martha.
[719.18 --> 720.02]  And the beautiful thing
[720.02 --> 721.26]  is by believing in Jesus
[721.26 --> 722.16]  by putting faith
[722.16 --> 722.84]  and trust in him
[722.84 --> 724.22]  you gain access
[724.22 --> 725.64]  to that resurrection life
[725.64 --> 726.84]  both in the future
[726.84 --> 728.50]  and it already breaks
[728.50 --> 729.16]  into the present.
[730.46 --> 731.38]  I'm the resurrection.
[733.26 --> 734.10]  And Martha of course
[734.10 --> 734.58]  it's hard to know
[734.58 --> 735.74]  exactly how she receives this
[735.74 --> 736.78]  but she comes with faith.
[737.12 --> 737.68]  She says Lord
[737.68 --> 738.56]  I believe
[738.56 --> 740.08]  you are the Messiah
[740.08 --> 741.16]  you've been sent by God
[741.16 --> 741.80]  you are the one
[741.80 --> 742.40]  who is coming
[742.40 --> 743.28]  into the world.
[743.28 --> 744.44]  She's got faith.
[745.24 --> 746.00]  And then she goes
[746.00 --> 746.62]  and gets her sister
[746.62 --> 747.18]  and there's a lot
[747.18 --> 747.70]  of conversation
[747.70 --> 748.32]  about the differences
[748.32 --> 749.56]  between Martha and Mary
[749.56 --> 750.88]  because Mary shows up
[750.88 --> 751.26]  to Jesus
[751.26 --> 752.34]  in a very different posture.
[752.80 --> 753.54]  She doesn't have a dialogue
[753.54 --> 754.24]  about the resurrection
[754.24 --> 754.92]  she doesn't come
[754.92 --> 756.32]  with some sort of challenge
[756.32 --> 757.46]  she just drops
[757.46 --> 758.48]  at Jesus' feet
[758.48 --> 759.66]  and she says
[759.66 --> 760.90]  Lord if you had been here
[760.90 --> 762.56]  my brother wouldn't have died.
[763.78 --> 764.64]  And what does she do next?
[765.46 --> 766.54]  What does Mary do next?
[767.52 --> 768.26]  She cries.
[768.26 --> 769.98]  She does what
[769.98 --> 772.16]  every reasonable person does
[772.16 --> 773.38]  when they lose a brother
[773.38 --> 773.92]  to death.
[774.82 --> 775.64]  She weeps
[775.64 --> 777.40]  at the feet of Jesus
[777.40 --> 777.96]  and there's actually
[777.96 --> 778.92]  a whole group of people
[778.92 --> 780.12]  that come and weep
[780.12 --> 781.12]  with her
[781.12 --> 782.38]  because Mary knows
[782.38 --> 783.30]  existentially
[783.30 --> 784.24]  what you and I all know
[784.24 --> 785.48]  that death is awful.
[786.24 --> 787.44]  That death is a tragedy
[787.44 --> 788.88]  it's a robbery of life
[788.88 --> 790.38]  it's proper response
[790.38 --> 790.68]  to death
[790.68 --> 792.48]  is always grief.
[793.84 --> 794.22]  In fact
[794.22 --> 796.22]  I have a particular disdain
[796.22 --> 797.10]  and I've been to a number
[797.10 --> 797.72]  of funerals
[797.72 --> 799.30]  and celebrations of life
[799.30 --> 800.38]  and memorials
[800.38 --> 801.40]  we call them all sorts of things
[801.40 --> 802.80]  and I have a particular disdain
[802.80 --> 803.98]  for moments
[803.98 --> 804.84]  where people will come up
[804.84 --> 805.40]  to the stage
[805.40 --> 806.60]  or the front of a funeral
[806.60 --> 808.62]  and they share these cliches
[808.62 --> 811.08]  and these strange platitudes
[811.08 --> 812.38]  that sort of try to soften
[812.38 --> 813.80]  the harsh reality of death
[813.80 --> 815.40]  they sort of make these weird statements
[815.40 --> 816.36]  that try to make it better
[816.36 --> 817.12]  and it doesn't.
[818.00 --> 819.22]  You know who doesn't do that?
[819.58 --> 821.28]  You know who doesn't make silly cliches
[821.28 --> 822.46]  and try to soften the edge of death?
[822.74 --> 824.20]  Jesus doesn't do that.
[824.84 --> 825.14]  In fact
[825.14 --> 826.06]  one of my favorite parts
[826.06 --> 827.34]  of this passage is verse 33
[827.34 --> 828.30]  I want to read it for you.
[830.16 --> 832.08]  When Jesus saw her weeping
[832.08 --> 833.70]  and the Jews
[833.70 --> 834.50]  who had come along
[834.50 --> 835.80]  with her also weeping
[835.80 --> 837.84]  he was deeply moved
[837.84 --> 838.84]  in spirit
[838.84 --> 839.76]  and troubled.
[840.86 --> 841.86]  And then two verses later
[841.86 --> 842.48]  what do we read?
[843.32 --> 843.72]  Jesus
[843.72 --> 845.04]  wept.
[846.62 --> 847.56]  Now there's two things
[847.56 --> 848.38]  Jesus doesn't do here
[848.38 --> 849.36]  that I think are very striking.
[849.48 --> 849.90]  Number one
[849.90 --> 851.00]  Jesus doesn't just bend over
[851.00 --> 851.58]  to Mary and say
[851.58 --> 852.02]  Mary
[852.02 --> 853.36]  I've come here
[853.36 --> 854.40]  to solve this problem.
[854.92 --> 856.06]  I'm going to raise Lazarus
[856.06 --> 856.38]  from the dead.
[856.50 --> 857.12]  Stand up Mary
[857.12 --> 858.06]  you don't need to be grieving
[858.06 --> 859.10]  you don't need to be weeping.
[859.48 --> 860.62]  Mary I'm going to solve this.
[860.70 --> 861.42]  He doesn't do that
[861.42 --> 862.96]  which is very surprising to me.
[863.10 --> 863.58]  Number two
[863.58 --> 864.62]  he doesn't do
[864.62 --> 865.72]  what like every one
[865.72 --> 866.76]  of my Dutch ancestors
[866.76 --> 867.30]  would have done
[867.30 --> 867.80]  which is
[867.80 --> 868.98]  no emotions
[868.98 --> 870.08]  bottled it up
[870.08 --> 871.10]  everything's fine
[871.10 --> 872.24]  I am not going to cry.
[872.92 --> 874.26]  The stoic response
[874.26 --> 874.60]  of like
[874.60 --> 875.44]  this isn't that bad
[875.44 --> 876.24]  it's fine
[876.24 --> 877.10]  no emotions.
[878.52 --> 878.80]  Jesus
[878.80 --> 880.34]  weeps with Mary.
[881.28 --> 882.76]  He is deeply moved
[882.76 --> 884.14]  by what Mary is crying for
[884.14 --> 885.34]  and he cries with her.
[886.70 --> 887.36]  A few years ago
[887.36 --> 887.96]  I read the book
[887.96 --> 889.24]  called Lament for a Son
[889.24 --> 890.48]  by Nicholas Wolterstorff
[890.48 --> 891.74]  he's a Christian philosopher
[891.74 --> 892.72]  a pretty big name
[892.72 --> 894.02]  in the Christian philosophy world
[894.02 --> 896.36]  and at a later age
[896.36 --> 896.94]  in his life
[896.94 --> 897.78]  he had a son
[897.78 --> 898.42]  who was hiking
[898.42 --> 899.54]  who was tragically killed
[899.54 --> 900.48]  in a hiking accident
[900.48 --> 901.32]  at the age of 25
[901.32 --> 903.08]  and he wrote this book
[903.08 --> 903.82]  Lament for a Son
[903.82 --> 904.46]  as a lament
[904.46 --> 905.50]  over the death of his son
[905.50 --> 906.66]  and I'm just paraphrasing now
[906.66 --> 907.56]  because I lent this book out
[907.56 --> 908.20]  and never got it back
[908.20 --> 908.96]  but this is what he says
[908.96 --> 909.32]  in the book
[909.32 --> 910.14]  to my memory
[910.14 --> 910.82]  if you have the book
[910.82 --> 911.64]  give it back to me.
[913.32 --> 913.92]  Wolterstorff says
[913.92 --> 915.24]  what I do not need
[915.24 --> 916.08]  as I grieve
[916.08 --> 917.12]  is people who stand
[917.12 --> 918.04]  at a distance from me
[918.04 --> 918.90]  and say it's okay
[918.90 --> 920.08]  death isn't that bad.
[921.00 --> 922.34]  What I do need
[922.34 --> 923.96]  is people who sit beside me
[923.96 --> 925.06]  in the morning bench
[925.06 --> 926.26]  and they weep with me.
[927.94 --> 928.34]  Jesus
[928.34 --> 930.46]  is sitting beside Mary
[930.46 --> 931.42]  on the morning bench
[931.42 --> 932.50]  and he is weeping
[932.50 --> 933.36]  with her.
[934.18 --> 935.00]  His tears
[935.00 --> 937.20]  join her tears
[937.20 --> 938.60]  and he gives her
[938.60 --> 939.16]  the fullness
[939.16 --> 941.10]  of his human emotion.
[942.06 --> 943.42]  Is that how you picture Jesus?
[945.38 --> 946.48]  Now I found buried
[946.48 --> 947.18]  in a commentary
[947.18 --> 948.60]  this quote by John Calvin
[948.60 --> 949.26]  that just like
[949.26 --> 950.94]  really hit me.
[951.00 --> 951.84]  I want to read this quote
[951.84 --> 952.26]  for you.
[952.70 --> 953.42]  John Calvin wrote
[953.42 --> 954.08]  as a commenter
[954.08 --> 954.82]  in this passage
[954.82 --> 955.24]  he says
[955.24 --> 955.94]  he is
[955.94 --> 957.32]  Jesus is as much
[957.32 --> 959.12]  affected by our ills
[959.12 --> 960.96]  as if he had suffered
[960.96 --> 961.60]  them himself.
[962.54 --> 963.32]  Let me say that again.
[963.32 --> 964.00]  He is
[964.00 --> 965.14]  Jesus is as much
[965.14 --> 966.32]  affected by our ills
[966.32 --> 967.36]  as if he suffered
[967.36 --> 968.06]  them himself.
[968.32 --> 968.98]  And what Calvin's
[968.98 --> 969.58]  getting at
[969.58 --> 970.46]  is that this isn't
[970.46 --> 971.30]  just a one time
[971.30 --> 972.06]  grief for Jesus.
[972.18 --> 972.88]  It's not like he has
[972.88 --> 974.04]  emotion for Mary
[974.04 --> 974.58]  over the death
[974.58 --> 975.34]  of his friend Lazarus
[975.34 --> 976.42]  and nothing left
[976.42 --> 977.28]  for anybody else.
[978.64 --> 979.30]  It's not like he doesn't
[979.30 --> 980.10]  care about the grief
[980.10 --> 980.86]  of people before
[980.86 --> 981.86]  and after Lazarus
[981.86 --> 982.46]  and that he has
[982.46 --> 983.28]  no more tears
[983.28 --> 983.88]  for the pain
[983.88 --> 984.38]  and the suffering
[984.38 --> 984.84]  and the sorrow
[984.84 --> 985.40]  and the death
[985.40 --> 986.32]  in our world.
[987.14 --> 988.20]  Are you hearing this?
[988.20 --> 990.68]  If that's true
[990.68 --> 992.68]  Jesus weeps
[992.68 --> 993.42]  with all of us.
[994.76 --> 995.56]  He weeps with you
[995.56 --> 996.42]  when you see
[996.42 --> 997.06]  the casket
[997.06 --> 997.88]  of your parent
[997.88 --> 999.06]  lowered into the ground.
[1000.18 --> 1001.08]  He weeps with you
[1001.08 --> 1001.76]  when you grab
[1001.76 --> 1003.22]  that oncology report
[1003.22 --> 1003.92]  from your doctor
[1003.92 --> 1004.66]  and the news
[1004.66 --> 1005.60]  is bad.
[1006.68 --> 1007.58]  He weeps with you
[1007.58 --> 1008.20]  as you hunch
[1008.20 --> 1009.22]  over this crib
[1009.22 --> 1010.02]  you bought years ago
[1010.02 --> 1010.90]  and it's still
[1010.90 --> 1011.60]  empty.
[1012.84 --> 1013.82]  He weeps with you
[1013.82 --> 1014.72]  as you eat a meal
[1014.72 --> 1015.66]  alone because
[1015.66 --> 1016.34]  there's a person
[1016.34 --> 1017.36]  missing at the table
[1017.36 --> 1018.20]  due to tragedy
[1018.20 --> 1019.40]  or divorce.
[1020.26 --> 1021.02]  Jesus weeps
[1021.02 --> 1021.50]  with you.
[1022.66 --> 1023.50]  Do you know that?
[1024.48 --> 1025.42]  Is that the picture
[1025.42 --> 1026.54]  you have of Jesus?
[1027.40 --> 1027.82]  Because I think
[1027.82 --> 1028.86]  so often we imagine
[1028.86 --> 1029.38]  him as sort of
[1029.38 --> 1030.10]  floating just above
[1030.10 --> 1030.50]  the ground
[1030.50 --> 1031.54]  with no real emotion
[1031.54 --> 1032.22]  or somehow
[1032.22 --> 1033.24]  in his ascension
[1033.24 --> 1034.62]  he lost his tear ducts.
[1035.40 --> 1036.40]  And what Calvin points out
[1036.40 --> 1037.20]  I think is a genius
[1037.20 --> 1038.14]  insight that the Jesus
[1038.14 --> 1039.10]  who weeps with Mary
[1039.10 --> 1039.84]  is the Jesus
[1039.84 --> 1041.24]  who weeps with everybody
[1041.24 --> 1042.72]  who suffers.
[1043.10 --> 1044.02]  With everybody
[1044.02 --> 1044.80]  who stands
[1044.80 --> 1045.84]  at the side of a tomb
[1045.84 --> 1046.96]  and cries
[1046.96 --> 1047.80]  over death
[1047.80 --> 1048.86]  because death
[1048.86 --> 1049.62]  is awful.
[1051.76 --> 1052.74]  More than that
[1052.74 --> 1054.30]  the passage said
[1054.30 --> 1055.18]  he's deeply moved
[1055.18 --> 1055.72]  in the spirit
[1055.72 --> 1056.60]  and he's troubled.
[1057.08 --> 1057.74]  And that word troubled
[1057.74 --> 1058.04]  I don't
[1058.04 --> 1058.74]  it just does not
[1058.74 --> 1059.44]  capture the force
[1059.44 --> 1060.06]  of the Greek there.
[1060.46 --> 1060.92]  The Greek can be
[1060.92 --> 1062.06]  translated as agitated
[1062.06 --> 1062.86]  indignant
[1062.86 --> 1064.34]  or even angry.
[1065.58 --> 1066.32]  Jesus is not just
[1066.32 --> 1067.10]  weeping with sadness
[1067.10 --> 1068.56]  he's weeping with anger.
[1069.40 --> 1070.16]  And there's some discussions
[1070.16 --> 1070.86]  like what is making
[1070.86 --> 1071.94]  Jesus so angry here?
[1072.06 --> 1072.70]  Some have suggested
[1072.70 --> 1073.48]  he's angry because
[1073.48 --> 1074.22]  there's unbelief
[1074.22 --> 1074.64]  and they don't think
[1074.64 --> 1075.20]  he's going to raise
[1075.20 --> 1076.08]  Lazarus from the dead.
[1076.36 --> 1077.08]  I disagree.
[1077.82 --> 1078.60]  I think Jesus
[1078.60 --> 1080.08]  is staring at death
[1080.08 --> 1081.08]  right in the face
[1081.08 --> 1082.50]  and more than anyone
[1082.50 --> 1083.38]  Jesus is angry
[1083.38 --> 1084.24]  because he knows
[1084.24 --> 1085.62]  that death was never
[1085.62 --> 1087.20]  meant to be here.
[1088.54 --> 1089.44]  Death was never
[1089.44 --> 1090.08]  meant to be part
[1090.08 --> 1091.08]  of God's good creation.
[1091.76 --> 1092.86]  The one who was there
[1092.86 --> 1093.32]  in the beginning
[1093.32 --> 1094.16]  through whom all things
[1094.16 --> 1094.76]  came into being
[1094.76 --> 1095.12]  is Jesus
[1095.12 --> 1096.14]  and he knows
[1096.14 --> 1097.40]  death and suffering
[1097.40 --> 1098.02]  and sorrow
[1098.02 --> 1099.34]  and tombstones
[1099.34 --> 1100.24]  and caskets
[1100.24 --> 1101.42]  were not part
[1101.42 --> 1102.24]  of his good creation.
[1102.24 --> 1104.14]  And he stares
[1104.14 --> 1105.16]  at it square in the face
[1105.16 --> 1105.46]  and he says
[1105.46 --> 1107.04]  you are not
[1107.04 --> 1108.82]  meant to be here.
[1109.90 --> 1110.88]  And he's angry.
[1112.58 --> 1114.26]  No one gets more upset
[1114.26 --> 1115.72]  by the evil
[1115.72 --> 1116.90]  and the atrocity
[1116.90 --> 1117.82]  and the murder
[1117.82 --> 1118.66]  and the pain
[1118.66 --> 1119.46]  of our world
[1119.46 --> 1120.68]  than Jesus.
[1122.76 --> 1123.70]  But he doesn't just
[1123.70 --> 1124.50]  bring to the tomb
[1124.50 --> 1125.16]  his tears
[1125.16 --> 1127.42]  or even his agitation.
[1128.58 --> 1129.40]  Jesus acts.
[1129.56 --> 1129.90]  And this is where
[1129.90 --> 1130.78]  we get to scene three.
[1132.24 --> 1134.18]  Scene three
[1134.18 --> 1135.58]  is Jesus going
[1135.58 --> 1136.18]  to the tomb
[1136.18 --> 1136.94]  and what he says
[1136.94 --> 1137.44]  to the people
[1137.44 --> 1138.30]  even in the state
[1138.30 --> 1139.24]  of being deeply moved
[1139.24 --> 1139.94]  being in a state
[1139.94 --> 1140.32]  of weeping
[1140.32 --> 1140.74]  he says
[1140.74 --> 1141.92]  take away the tomb.
[1142.38 --> 1143.14]  Take away the stone
[1143.14 --> 1143.46]  sorry.
[1145.20 --> 1145.70]  And Martha
[1145.70 --> 1146.98]  who has up until this point
[1146.98 --> 1148.20]  been an exemplar
[1148.20 --> 1148.80]  of faith
[1148.80 --> 1150.20]  sort of a testimony
[1150.20 --> 1151.20]  of belief in Jesus
[1151.20 --> 1151.94]  she's the one
[1151.94 --> 1152.46]  who speaks up
[1152.46 --> 1152.70]  and said
[1152.70 --> 1154.26]  Jesus that's a bad idea.
[1155.18 --> 1156.32]  Let's not roll away
[1156.32 --> 1156.84]  the stone
[1156.84 --> 1158.74]  because our brother
[1158.74 --> 1159.20]  Lazarus
[1159.20 --> 1159.64]  has been in there
[1159.64 --> 1160.24]  for four days
[1160.24 --> 1161.14]  the odor is going
[1161.14 --> 1161.42]  to be bad.
[1161.42 --> 1162.84]  This is a bad idea.
[1162.94 --> 1163.38]  We don't do
[1163.38 --> 1164.10]  this kind of stuff.
[1164.18 --> 1164.96]  These are my limits.
[1165.14 --> 1165.30]  Right?
[1165.96 --> 1166.36]  She thought
[1166.36 --> 1167.34]  perhaps he could
[1167.34 --> 1168.28]  keep him from dying
[1168.28 --> 1169.42]  but this is getting weird.
[1171.00 --> 1171.94]  Then Jesus prays
[1171.94 --> 1172.50]  to the father
[1172.50 --> 1174.16]  thanking him
[1174.16 --> 1175.06]  for hearing his prayer
[1175.06 --> 1176.18]  and he speaks
[1176.18 --> 1178.72]  one simple sentence.
[1180.78 --> 1181.26]  Lazarus
[1181.26 --> 1183.44]  come out.
[1184.50 --> 1185.28]  And John
[1185.28 --> 1186.40]  in the plainest
[1186.40 --> 1187.30]  possible way
[1187.30 --> 1188.34]  simply says to us
[1188.34 --> 1189.62]  the dead man
[1189.62 --> 1190.90]  came out of the tomb.
[1192.46 --> 1193.54]  With three
[1193.54 --> 1195.16]  simple words
[1195.16 --> 1196.38]  a person
[1196.38 --> 1196.86]  who is
[1196.86 --> 1198.18]  decomposing
[1198.18 --> 1199.98]  wrapped in linens
[1199.98 --> 1200.88]  stumbles
[1200.88 --> 1202.04]  into the light
[1202.04 --> 1203.04]  at the response
[1203.04 --> 1204.20]  of Jesus' words.
[1205.14 --> 1206.46]  Or as one commentator
[1206.46 --> 1206.84]  put it
[1206.84 --> 1207.88]  the good shepherd
[1207.88 --> 1209.80]  spoke his name
[1209.80 --> 1211.60]  and Lazarus
[1211.60 --> 1212.92]  like a good sheep
[1212.92 --> 1214.60]  responded to his voice.
[1214.60 --> 1218.34]  And it's right here
[1218.34 --> 1219.62]  I need to make this point
[1219.62 --> 1220.20]  as clear as possible
[1220.20 --> 1220.68]  it's right here
[1220.68 --> 1221.12]  that Mary,
[1221.30 --> 1221.52]  Martha,
[1221.66 --> 1222.38]  all the witnesses
[1222.38 --> 1222.96]  standing there
[1222.96 --> 1223.86]  as well as you
[1223.86 --> 1224.16]  and me
[1224.16 --> 1224.82]  reading the story
[1224.82 --> 1225.50]  we need to make
[1225.50 --> 1225.90]  a decision.
[1226.82 --> 1227.42]  John's been on
[1227.42 --> 1227.86]  about something
[1227.86 --> 1228.64]  throughout this gospel
[1228.64 --> 1229.12]  he's been telling
[1229.12 --> 1230.08]  stories of miracles
[1230.08 --> 1231.04]  stories of Jesus'
[1231.20 --> 1231.48]  identity
[1231.48 --> 1232.16]  and it's right here
[1232.16 --> 1232.64]  we have to say
[1232.64 --> 1233.74]  is Jesus
[1233.74 --> 1234.50]  actually what
[1234.50 --> 1235.30]  he says he is?
[1235.78 --> 1236.46]  Did this event
[1236.46 --> 1237.68]  actually take place?
[1238.18 --> 1239.00]  Because if it didn't
[1239.00 --> 1239.94]  we need to make
[1239.94 --> 1240.70]  some serious decisions
[1240.70 --> 1241.72]  and if it did
[1241.72 --> 1242.58]  we need to make
[1242.58 --> 1243.48]  some serious decisions
[1243.48 --> 1245.56]  and John wants
[1245.56 --> 1246.40]  to be as upfront
[1246.40 --> 1247.10]  as possible
[1247.10 --> 1248.08]  that Jesus is not
[1248.08 --> 1249.18]  just a creative teacher
[1249.18 --> 1251.18]  not just full of wisdom
[1251.18 --> 1252.04]  not just a prophet
[1252.04 --> 1253.00]  not just someone
[1253.00 --> 1253.54]  who could heal
[1253.54 --> 1254.62]  someone or paraplegic
[1254.62 --> 1255.42]  or paraplegic
[1255.42 --> 1256.56]  or feed the 5,000
[1256.56 --> 1257.82]  this man
[1257.82 --> 1259.68]  is the resurrection.
[1261.12 --> 1262.36]  He is the face
[1262.36 --> 1263.14]  and the name
[1263.14 --> 1264.16]  of resurrection
[1264.16 --> 1266.14]  and Jesus
[1266.14 --> 1267.24]  in this story
[1267.24 --> 1268.24]  shatters all
[1268.24 --> 1269.30]  the preconceived notions
[1269.30 --> 1270.24]  that Jews had of him
[1270.24 --> 1271.12]  he shatters all
[1271.12 --> 1271.70]  the boxes
[1271.70 --> 1272.14]  that people
[1272.14 --> 1272.72]  even today
[1272.72 --> 1273.60]  put around him
[1273.60 --> 1274.00]  and he says
[1274.00 --> 1275.26]  I am the resurrection
[1275.26 --> 1275.76]  and the life
[1275.76 --> 1276.76]  and when I speak
[1276.76 --> 1278.68]  death is undone
[1278.68 --> 1280.46]  when I speak
[1280.46 --> 1281.44]  dead people
[1281.44 --> 1282.46]  who are in a tomb
[1282.46 --> 1283.10]  decomposing
[1283.10 --> 1283.96]  walk out
[1283.96 --> 1284.68]  at the response
[1284.68 --> 1285.30]  of my voice
[1285.30 --> 1286.48]  I'm the resurrection
[1286.48 --> 1288.80]  and that calls
[1288.80 --> 1289.80]  for a response
[1289.80 --> 1291.40]  what do we make
[1291.40 --> 1292.54]  of Jesus?
[1295.06 --> 1296.04]  Now I want to finish
[1296.04 --> 1297.10]  with three reflections
[1297.10 --> 1297.94]  on this passage
[1297.94 --> 1299.66]  and I got permission
[1299.66 --> 1300.62]  from Jonathan
[1300.62 --> 1301.02]  our intern
[1301.02 --> 1302.06]  to elaborate more
[1302.06 --> 1302.44]  than I did
[1302.44 --> 1303.04]  in the first service
[1303.04 --> 1303.70]  so buckle up
[1303.70 --> 1305.48]  firstly
[1305.48 --> 1306.50]  you're nervous now
[1306.50 --> 1307.14]  firstly
[1307.14 --> 1308.18]  if Jesus
[1308.18 --> 1309.24]  is the resurrection
[1309.24 --> 1310.74]  you and I
[1310.74 --> 1311.18]  do not need
[1311.18 --> 1311.80]  to fear death
[1311.80 --> 1313.38]  and I need
[1313.38 --> 1314.06]  to make that point
[1314.06 --> 1314.48]  as clearly
[1314.48 --> 1314.96]  as I can
[1314.96 --> 1315.32]  in the west
[1315.32 --> 1315.78]  because you
[1315.78 --> 1316.48]  and I know this
[1316.48 --> 1316.84]  we probably
[1316.84 --> 1317.50]  experience this
[1317.50 --> 1318.40]  in Canada
[1318.40 --> 1319.72]  we generally
[1319.72 --> 1320.12]  speaking
[1320.12 --> 1320.76]  are afraid
[1320.76 --> 1321.20]  of death
[1321.20 --> 1322.10]  we don't know
[1322.10 --> 1322.64]  how to speak
[1322.64 --> 1322.94]  about it
[1322.94 --> 1323.26]  we don't know
[1323.26 --> 1323.52]  how to deal
[1323.52 --> 1323.80]  with it
[1323.80 --> 1324.20]  even when we
[1324.20 --> 1324.54]  talk about
[1324.54 --> 1325.02]  celebrations
[1325.02 --> 1325.48]  of life
[1325.48 --> 1326.16]  we use all
[1326.16 --> 1326.70]  the language
[1326.70 --> 1327.36]  that avoids
[1327.36 --> 1327.62]  the fact
[1327.62 --> 1327.90]  that there's
[1327.90 --> 1328.44]  a person
[1328.44 --> 1329.28]  who died
[1329.28 --> 1330.64]  and this is
[1330.64 --> 1331.16]  I showed this
[1331.16 --> 1331.66]  in the 9am
[1331.66 --> 1332.04]  as well
[1332.04 --> 1333.44]  what an American
[1333.44 --> 1333.78]  thing
[1333.78 --> 1334.16]  but there's
[1334.16 --> 1334.58]  an invention
[1334.58 --> 1335.24]  about 10 years
[1335.24 --> 1335.44]  ago
[1335.44 --> 1335.90]  or an idea
[1335.90 --> 1336.26]  and they have
[1336.26 --> 1336.72]  drive-through
[1336.72 --> 1337.40]  funeral homes
[1337.40 --> 1338.36]  think about that
[1338.36 --> 1339.52]  drive-through
[1339.52 --> 1340.60]  funeral homes
[1340.60 --> 1342.48]  now I don't know
[1342.48 --> 1343.14]  all the logic
[1343.14 --> 1343.68]  behind that
[1343.68 --> 1344.10]  but I know
[1344.10 --> 1344.62]  one of the
[1344.62 --> 1345.38]  logics is probably
[1345.38 --> 1345.80]  that people
[1345.80 --> 1346.56]  don't like death
[1346.56 --> 1346.92]  they don't want
[1346.92 --> 1347.44]  to get close
[1347.44 --> 1347.66]  to it
[1347.66 --> 1347.92]  they don't want
[1347.92 --> 1348.42]  to talk about it
[1348.42 --> 1349.22]  so to drive
[1349.22 --> 1349.64]  through in the
[1349.64 --> 1350.40]  safety of your car
[1350.40 --> 1351.18]  pay your respects
[1351.18 --> 1351.90]  maybe make a gift
[1351.90 --> 1352.58]  bring some flowers
[1352.58 --> 1353.30]  perfect
[1353.30 --> 1354.44]  you don't have
[1354.44 --> 1355.18]  to engage it
[1355.18 --> 1356.82]  we have no idea
[1356.82 --> 1357.22]  what to do
[1357.22 --> 1357.56]  with death
[1357.56 --> 1358.50]  not to mention
[1358.50 --> 1359.84]  the multi-billion
[1359.84 --> 1360.66]  dollar industry
[1360.66 --> 1361.62]  that tries to
[1361.62 --> 1362.06]  slow down
[1362.06 --> 1363.04]  our aging process
[1363.04 --> 1363.76]  right
[1363.76 --> 1365.08]  think of the
[1365.08 --> 1365.66]  creams that
[1365.66 --> 1366.62]  audaciously say
[1366.62 --> 1366.86]  to you
[1366.86 --> 1368.00]  this is anti-aging
[1368.00 --> 1370.82]  age defying
[1370.82 --> 1372.24]  there's more
[1372.24 --> 1372.66]  than that
[1372.66 --> 1373.88]  it's ludicrous
[1373.88 --> 1374.96]  and it's just
[1374.96 --> 1375.34]  hiding
[1375.34 --> 1376.06]  it's masking
[1376.06 --> 1376.46]  the reality
[1376.46 --> 1377.18]  that we will
[1377.18 --> 1377.70]  die
[1377.70 --> 1378.84]  and that's
[1378.84 --> 1379.22]  a morbid
[1379.22 --> 1379.40]  thought
[1379.40 --> 1379.68]  but you need
[1379.68 --> 1380.02]  to face it
[1380.02 --> 1380.88]  every person
[1380.88 --> 1381.32]  who lives
[1381.32 --> 1381.94]  will die
[1381.94 --> 1383.22]  but western
[1383.22 --> 1383.46]  people
[1383.46 --> 1383.92]  we don't know
[1383.92 --> 1384.34]  how to talk
[1384.34 --> 1384.62]  about it
[1384.62 --> 1385.08]  and at the
[1385.08 --> 1385.64]  center of the
[1385.64 --> 1386.22]  Christian faith
[1386.22 --> 1386.78]  at the center
[1386.78 --> 1387.28]  of the story
[1387.28 --> 1388.02]  is Jesus
[1388.02 --> 1388.98]  speaking the words
[1388.98 --> 1390.60]  I am resurrection
[1390.60 --> 1392.60]  death is not
[1392.60 --> 1393.16]  the thing you need
[1393.16 --> 1393.64]  to fear
[1393.64 --> 1394.90]  if you are in me
[1394.90 --> 1396.38]  are you hearing
[1396.38 --> 1396.82]  this hope
[1396.82 --> 1398.58]  at the center
[1398.58 --> 1399.06]  of the Christian
[1399.06 --> 1399.76]  faith is Jesus
[1399.76 --> 1400.72]  holding the keys
[1400.72 --> 1402.08]  past the enemy
[1402.08 --> 1402.62]  of death
[1402.62 --> 1403.68]  and saying
[1403.68 --> 1404.62]  I hold life
[1404.62 --> 1405.72]  and in me
[1405.72 --> 1406.32]  is resurrection
[1406.32 --> 1408.08]  and that's why
[1408.08 --> 1408.98]  New Testament
[1408.98 --> 1410.16]  authors audaciously
[1410.16 --> 1410.86]  and this is an
[1410.86 --> 1411.54]  audacious claim
[1411.54 --> 1412.28]  like Paul in
[1412.28 --> 1412.88]  Corinthians says
[1412.88 --> 1413.80]  where oh death
[1413.80 --> 1414.48]  is your sting
[1414.48 --> 1416.14]  where is your sting
[1416.14 --> 1416.68]  we are people
[1416.68 --> 1417.46]  of the resurrection
[1417.46 --> 1418.58]  we have found
[1418.58 --> 1419.00]  life
[1419.00 --> 1419.64]  not just in the
[1419.64 --> 1419.86]  future
[1419.86 --> 1420.24]  but in the
[1420.24 --> 1420.48]  present
[1420.48 --> 1421.12]  and we no
[1421.12 --> 1421.76]  longer fear
[1421.76 --> 1422.36]  death
[1422.36 --> 1424.44]  what a statement
[1424.44 --> 1425.50]  it's why the
[1425.50 --> 1426.24]  same apostles
[1426.24 --> 1427.06]  who when they
[1427.06 --> 1427.62]  are confronted
[1427.62 --> 1428.24]  challenged
[1428.24 --> 1428.90]  persecuted
[1428.90 --> 1429.66]  and martyred
[1429.66 --> 1430.22]  they are not
[1430.22 --> 1430.60]  afraid
[1430.60 --> 1432.30]  they are sticking
[1432.30 --> 1433.10]  true to the
[1433.10 --> 1433.62]  name of Jesus
[1433.62 --> 1434.36]  because that's
[1434.36 --> 1434.80]  the name that
[1434.80 --> 1435.38]  holds their hand
[1435.38 --> 1436.14]  through death
[1436.14 --> 1437.18]  into resurrection
[1437.18 --> 1438.90]  that is the
[1438.90 --> 1439.36]  hope that
[1439.36 --> 1440.42]  permeates the
[1440.42 --> 1440.76]  scriptures
[1440.76 --> 1442.50]  Jesus saying
[1442.50 --> 1442.84]  I'm the
[1442.84 --> 1443.30]  resurrection
[1443.30 --> 1444.60]  and by faith
[1444.60 --> 1445.02]  in me
[1445.02 --> 1446.30]  you join the
[1446.30 --> 1447.16]  life of the
[1447.16 --> 1447.62]  resurrection
[1447.62 --> 1449.24]  that's the
[1449.24 --> 1449.60]  gift
[1449.60 --> 1453.14]  now secondly
[1453.14 --> 1456.32]  one of my
[1456.32 --> 1456.80]  favorite parts
[1456.80 --> 1457.36]  of this story
[1457.36 --> 1457.80]  is actually
[1457.80 --> 1458.28]  Mary and
[1458.28 --> 1458.56]  Martha
[1458.56 --> 1460.48]  Mary and
[1460.48 --> 1460.76]  Martha
[1460.76 --> 1461.80]  have a sick
[1461.80 --> 1462.14]  brother
[1462.14 --> 1463.44]  and the
[1463.44 --> 1463.86]  first thing
[1463.86 --> 1464.32]  they do
[1464.32 --> 1465.18]  is call
[1465.18 --> 1465.64]  for Jesus
[1465.64 --> 1467.10]  now let me
[1467.10 --> 1467.80]  ask you this
[1467.80 --> 1469.00]  you have a
[1469.00 --> 1469.52]  sick brother
[1469.52 --> 1470.10]  or sister
[1470.10 --> 1470.70]  or daughter
[1470.70 --> 1471.26]  or son
[1471.26 --> 1472.34]  what's the
[1472.34 --> 1472.70]  first thing
[1472.70 --> 1473.16]  you do
[1473.16 --> 1475.40]  take some
[1475.40 --> 1476.06]  meds
[1476.06 --> 1477.92]  call 811
[1477.92 --> 1479.20]  or Amy and
[1479.20 --> 1479.56]  Brent our
[1479.56 --> 1480.18]  in-house nurses
[1480.18 --> 1480.58]  here and
[1480.58 --> 1481.20]  Brittany and
[1481.20 --> 1481.58]  I just call
[1481.58 --> 1481.92]  the nurses
[1481.92 --> 1482.48]  in our church
[1482.48 --> 1483.54]  then we go
[1483.54 --> 1484.02]  to the ER
[1484.02 --> 1484.50]  right
[1484.50 --> 1485.74]  that's what
[1485.74 --> 1486.10]  we do
[1486.10 --> 1486.92]  and don't
[1486.92 --> 1487.38]  get me wrong
[1487.38 --> 1487.90]  I do not
[1487.90 --> 1488.38]  want to create
[1488.38 --> 1488.96]  any division
[1488.96 --> 1489.72]  between medical
[1489.72 --> 1490.46]  care which is
[1490.46 --> 1490.94]  always the
[1490.94 --> 1491.50]  hand of Jesus
[1491.50 --> 1492.88]  and God
[1492.88 --> 1493.72]  acting very
[1493.72 --> 1494.20]  what you might
[1494.20 --> 1494.78]  call quote
[1494.78 --> 1495.00]  unquote
[1495.00 --> 1495.76]  supernaturally
[1495.76 --> 1496.32]  I see no
[1496.32 --> 1496.60]  division
[1496.60 --> 1497.38]  Jesus is present
[1497.38 --> 1498.12]  in all of it
[1498.12 --> 1498.86]  and my goodness
[1498.86 --> 1499.24]  when I got
[1499.24 --> 1499.74]  kidney stones
[1499.74 --> 1500.34]  I was never
[1500.34 --> 1500.96]  more thankful
[1500.96 --> 1502.24]  for the medical
[1502.24 --> 1502.86]  advances we've
[1502.86 --> 1503.04]  had
[1503.04 --> 1504.02]  I'm gonna die
[1504.02 --> 1504.48]  I'm gonna die
[1504.48 --> 1504.74]  and they gave
[1504.74 --> 1505.20]  me morphine
[1505.20 --> 1505.52]  and it was
[1505.52 --> 1506.02]  amazing
[1506.02 --> 1507.46]  you should try
[1507.46 --> 1507.88]  this stuff
[1507.88 --> 1508.54]  it's incredible
[1508.54 --> 1509.96]  big fan of
[1509.96 --> 1510.32]  morphine
[1510.32 --> 1510.84]  thank you to
[1510.84 --> 1511.14]  the people
[1511.14 --> 1511.66]  who discovered
[1511.66 --> 1512.20]  that drug
[1512.20 --> 1513.18]  in moderation
[1513.18 --> 1513.80]  not when you're
[1513.80 --> 1514.26]  not sick
[1514.26 --> 1514.68]  you get the
[1514.68 --> 1514.90]  rest
[1514.90 --> 1517.16]  but think about
[1517.16 --> 1517.62]  that flinch
[1517.62 --> 1518.12]  that Mary and
[1518.12 --> 1518.52]  Martha had
[1518.52 --> 1518.86]  where it's like
[1518.86 --> 1519.80]  Lazarus is sick
[1519.80 --> 1520.32]  he's gonna die
[1520.32 --> 1521.34]  go get Jesus
[1521.34 --> 1522.14]  we need him
[1522.14 --> 1523.94]  do you have
[1523.94 --> 1524.78]  that response
[1524.78 --> 1525.66]  to pain
[1525.66 --> 1526.24]  and suffering
[1526.24 --> 1526.98]  and loss
[1526.98 --> 1528.46]  I'm not sure
[1528.46 --> 1528.96]  I do
[1528.96 --> 1530.32]  and I really
[1530.32 --> 1530.72]  do think
[1530.72 --> 1531.22]  there's a sense
[1531.22 --> 1531.52]  in which
[1531.52 --> 1531.96]  the scriptures
[1531.96 --> 1532.40]  and not just
[1532.40 --> 1533.00]  this passage
[1533.00 --> 1533.86]  but Hebrews 4
[1533.86 --> 1534.28]  who say hey
[1534.28 --> 1535.08]  you can go to
[1535.08 --> 1535.70]  the throne of God
[1535.70 --> 1537.10]  boldly and confidently
[1537.10 --> 1538.60]  you can go to the
[1538.60 --> 1539.70]  Jesus who still cares
[1539.70 --> 1540.46]  who still weeps
[1540.46 --> 1541.22]  who still grieves
[1541.22 --> 1541.76]  over suffering
[1541.76 --> 1542.22]  pain and death
[1542.22 --> 1543.40]  and you can ask
[1543.40 --> 1544.90]  you can seek
[1544.90 --> 1546.18]  you can knock
[1546.18 --> 1548.50]  and yes it's true
[1548.50 --> 1549.48]  sometimes we have
[1549.48 --> 1551.36]  no seeming answer
[1551.36 --> 1553.02]  but it is also true
[1553.02 --> 1553.82]  that we see answers
[1553.82 --> 1555.22]  we see healing
[1555.22 --> 1556.98]  we see resurrection
[1556.98 --> 1557.88]  we see life
[1557.88 --> 1559.76]  and so we're called
[1559.76 --> 1560.38]  to ask
[1560.38 --> 1563.76]  this brings me
[1563.76 --> 1565.08]  to our third point
[1565.08 --> 1566.24]  and I have a feeling
[1566.24 --> 1567.62]  this has been rattling
[1567.62 --> 1568.32]  around your head
[1568.32 --> 1569.02]  as I've been preaching
[1569.02 --> 1569.80]  the sermon already
[1569.80 --> 1570.54]  and I'm gonna frame
[1570.54 --> 1571.22]  my third point
[1571.22 --> 1572.20]  in the form of a question
[1572.20 --> 1573.50]  that comes from
[1573.50 --> 1574.22]  a seven year old
[1574.22 --> 1574.80]  in our church
[1574.80 --> 1576.26]  so Andrew and Natalia
[1576.26 --> 1577.08]  a couple in our church
[1577.08 --> 1578.04]  are you here Andrew and Natalia
[1578.04 --> 1580.96]  I thought I saw one of them
[1580.96 --> 1582.16]  they were here at the 9am
[1582.16 --> 1584.12]  they're reading John 11
[1584.12 --> 1584.78]  with their kids
[1584.78 --> 1585.60]  as they're preparing
[1585.60 --> 1586.26]  for this Sunday
[1586.26 --> 1587.54]  and they read the whole story
[1587.54 --> 1588.68]  and their seven year old
[1588.68 --> 1589.62]  Cadence pipes up
[1589.62 --> 1591.90]  why does Lazarus
[1591.90 --> 1593.68]  get to rise back to life
[1593.68 --> 1595.70]  and Eleanor doesn't
[1595.70 --> 1598.20]  Eleanor is a three year old
[1598.20 --> 1599.62]  who lives just a few doors down
[1599.62 --> 1601.24]  who died two weeks ago
[1601.24 --> 1602.06]  in her sleep
[1602.06 --> 1604.44]  now Cadence
[1604.44 --> 1605.36]  that is a question
[1605.36 --> 1607.40]  this is why I don't ask
[1607.40 --> 1609.28]  we shouldn't always invite questions
[1609.28 --> 1609.86]  to the pastors
[1609.86 --> 1610.60]  for us to preach on
[1610.60 --> 1611.90]  but man that is a question
[1611.90 --> 1613.92]  I would even add to that
[1613.92 --> 1614.86]  a suspicious reader
[1614.86 --> 1615.38]  of the scripture
[1615.38 --> 1616.40]  would probably say
[1616.40 --> 1617.80]  let me get this straight
[1617.80 --> 1619.80]  Jesus raises Lazarus to life
[1619.80 --> 1621.18]  once
[1621.18 --> 1622.78]  and that's it
[1622.78 --> 1624.36]  why in the world
[1624.36 --> 1625.12]  doesn't he just go
[1625.12 --> 1626.30]  to all the medical clinics
[1626.30 --> 1627.08]  and all the graves
[1627.08 --> 1627.48]  all over
[1627.48 --> 1628.66]  and just start raising people
[1628.66 --> 1629.16]  back to life
[1629.16 --> 1629.86]  wouldn't that be
[1629.86 --> 1631.62]  a much more effective ministry
[1631.62 --> 1632.60]  wouldn't that be
[1632.60 --> 1633.64]  more effective proof
[1633.64 --> 1634.22]  that makes people
[1634.22 --> 1634.84]  believe in him
[1634.84 --> 1636.06]  why does he only do this
[1636.06 --> 1637.38]  once for goodness sake
[1637.38 --> 1640.46]  and personally
[1640.46 --> 1641.18]  I'm guessing
[1641.18 --> 1642.24]  there's a number of people here
[1642.24 --> 1643.70]  who think to themselves
[1643.70 --> 1644.60]  why doesn't Jesus
[1644.60 --> 1645.72]  do it for me
[1645.72 --> 1648.00]  in these circumstances
[1648.00 --> 1649.08]  with my parent
[1649.08 --> 1649.90]  with my child
[1649.90 --> 1650.68]  with my friend
[1650.68 --> 1651.72]  with my own health
[1651.72 --> 1653.10]  why doesn't he heal me
[1653.10 --> 1653.88]  right
[1653.88 --> 1655.18]  there's the question
[1655.18 --> 1657.34]  the first answer
[1657.34 --> 1658.06]  I'm going to give to that
[1658.06 --> 1659.50]  is it's above my pay grade
[1659.50 --> 1660.76]  that answer
[1660.76 --> 1662.64]  and I do mean that honestly
[1662.64 --> 1662.98]  I remember
[1662.98 --> 1664.04]  the first time I preached on this
[1664.04 --> 1664.94]  was at my friend's funeral
[1664.94 --> 1666.10]  I remember Kenny
[1666.10 --> 1667.60]  my best friend in high school
[1667.60 --> 1668.56]  his wife
[1668.56 --> 1669.54]  I married them
[1669.54 --> 1670.28]  a number of years ago
[1670.28 --> 1670.92]  and then
[1670.92 --> 1672.10]  at the age of 31
[1672.10 --> 1673.84]  she died of cystic fibrosis
[1673.84 --> 1675.26]  and I preached on this passage
[1675.26 --> 1675.70]  at her wedding
[1675.70 --> 1676.76]  and I had no means
[1676.76 --> 1677.84]  I had no desire
[1677.84 --> 1678.88]  to stand up there
[1678.88 --> 1679.08]  and say
[1679.08 --> 1680.12]  this is why this happened
[1680.12 --> 1681.62]  this is why
[1681.62 --> 1682.94]  Caitlin S. cystic fibrosis
[1682.94 --> 1683.88]  and Dave Grun doesn't
[1683.88 --> 1685.58]  that is above my pay grade
[1685.58 --> 1687.88]  but I did know how to preach
[1687.88 --> 1688.32]  on that
[1688.32 --> 1689.38]  and the first thing
[1689.38 --> 1690.06]  I want us to highlight
[1690.06 --> 1690.80]  and just trust
[1690.80 --> 1691.54]  is that God
[1691.54 --> 1692.84]  is sovereign
[1692.84 --> 1694.90]  God allows
[1694.90 --> 1695.68]  what God allows
[1695.68 --> 1696.56]  and God doesn't allow
[1696.56 --> 1697.28]  what God doesn't allow
[1697.28 --> 1698.20]  and we trust God
[1698.20 --> 1698.66]  to be God
[1698.66 --> 1699.26]  and we trust us
[1699.26 --> 1699.68]  to be human
[1699.68 --> 1700.12]  and there's just
[1700.12 --> 1701.00]  access to questions
[1701.00 --> 1701.86]  we do not have
[1701.86 --> 1702.98]  until we see Jesus
[1702.98 --> 1703.64]  face to face
[1703.64 --> 1705.12]  I think a lot of us
[1705.12 --> 1706.02]  have to come to peace
[1706.02 --> 1706.48]  with that
[1706.48 --> 1707.98]  but secondly
[1707.98 --> 1708.70]  and I think this is
[1708.70 --> 1709.60]  a really important point
[1709.60 --> 1710.62]  Jesus never wastes
[1710.62 --> 1711.14]  our suffering
[1711.14 --> 1713.00]  I mean there is so much
[1713.00 --> 1713.54]  in the New Testament
[1713.54 --> 1714.26]  about suffering
[1714.26 --> 1714.96]  and what God is doing
[1714.96 --> 1715.64]  in and through it
[1715.64 --> 1716.70]  and I'm sure it's true
[1716.70 --> 1717.20]  for you to say
[1717.20 --> 1717.84]  about your own life
[1717.84 --> 1718.76]  that the seasons
[1718.76 --> 1719.40]  of growth
[1719.40 --> 1720.24]  and transformation
[1720.24 --> 1721.48]  the seasons
[1721.48 --> 1722.52]  where you really leaned
[1722.52 --> 1723.04]  into Christ
[1723.04 --> 1723.46]  and you learned
[1723.46 --> 1723.80]  what it meant
[1723.80 --> 1724.80]  to live in Christ
[1724.80 --> 1725.82]  were probably not
[1725.82 --> 1726.82]  your easiest seasons
[1726.82 --> 1727.50]  am I right?
[1728.52 --> 1729.16]  They were seasons
[1729.16 --> 1730.02]  where you struggled
[1730.02 --> 1731.48]  where you suffered
[1731.48 --> 1732.62]  where there was crisis
[1732.62 --> 1733.34]  where there was pain
[1733.34 --> 1734.30]  and you were forced
[1734.30 --> 1735.50]  in and through that pain
[1735.50 --> 1736.78]  to go near the cross
[1736.78 --> 1738.52]  and find the saving
[1738.52 --> 1739.58]  loving presence
[1739.58 --> 1740.46]  of Jesus Christ
[1740.46 --> 1741.54]  is that true for you?
[1742.36 --> 1743.08]  Your suffering
[1743.08 --> 1743.88]  is not wasted
[1743.88 --> 1745.10]  in Christ
[1745.10 --> 1748.68]  but I think
[1748.68 --> 1749.52]  I can't finish
[1749.52 --> 1750.16]  answering that
[1750.16 --> 1751.28]  without making us see
[1751.28 --> 1753.16]  that John's gospel
[1753.16 --> 1754.16]  doesn't end
[1754.16 --> 1755.78]  in chapter 11
[1755.78 --> 1757.56]  in fact this story
[1757.56 --> 1758.28]  I would say
[1758.28 --> 1759.26]  is not ultimately
[1759.26 --> 1760.86]  even about Lazarus
[1760.86 --> 1762.64]  it's about Jesus
[1762.64 --> 1764.30]  and Lazarus
[1764.30 --> 1765.46]  yes he rises to life
[1765.46 --> 1766.38]  but guess what happens
[1766.38 --> 1767.68]  at the end of that life
[1767.68 --> 1768.98]  Lazarus still dies
[1768.98 --> 1771.48]  and Jesus is not interested
[1771.48 --> 1772.06]  in doing like
[1772.06 --> 1773.08]  a one time trick
[1773.08 --> 1773.86]  to show his power
[1773.86 --> 1775.02]  he's got a much
[1775.02 --> 1776.14]  bigger vision in place
[1776.14 --> 1776.74]  and that's how
[1776.74 --> 1777.60]  Lazarus' story
[1777.60 --> 1778.16]  points forward
[1778.16 --> 1778.86]  to John 19
[1778.86 --> 1780.56]  and there's a lot
[1780.56 --> 1781.18]  of foreshadowing
[1781.18 --> 1782.04]  of Jesus' cross
[1782.04 --> 1783.16]  in John 11
[1783.16 --> 1784.88]  the three loud words
[1784.88 --> 1785.68]  that Jesus cries
[1785.68 --> 1786.70]  over Lazarus' tomb
[1786.70 --> 1787.58]  point forward
[1787.58 --> 1788.82]  to three more loud words
[1788.82 --> 1789.86]  that Jesus is going to cry
[1789.86 --> 1790.86]  from the cross
[1790.86 --> 1791.64]  do you know what those are?
[1793.16 --> 1793.58]  he cries
[1793.58 --> 1794.30]  over the whole
[1794.30 --> 1794.98]  of his creation
[1794.98 --> 1797.14]  it is finished
[1797.14 --> 1799.92]  and what Jesus is after
[1799.92 --> 1800.70]  is not just bringing
[1800.70 --> 1801.52]  one person to life
[1801.52 --> 1802.48]  but bringing death
[1802.48 --> 1803.14]  to death
[1803.14 --> 1804.66]  defeating once
[1804.66 --> 1805.22]  and for all
[1805.22 --> 1806.22]  the finality of death
[1806.22 --> 1806.98]  and opening the door
[1806.98 --> 1807.46]  of resurrection
[1807.46 --> 1808.80]  once and for all
[1808.80 --> 1810.10]  and it's on the cross
[1810.10 --> 1810.56]  where he says
[1810.56 --> 1811.52]  I will take
[1811.52 --> 1812.28]  the fullness
[1812.28 --> 1813.52]  and the fury
[1813.52 --> 1814.08]  of the powers
[1814.08 --> 1814.84]  and principalities
[1814.84 --> 1815.66]  I'll take on
[1815.66 --> 1816.26]  the fullness
[1816.26 --> 1817.44]  of human misery
[1817.44 --> 1818.04]  and sin
[1818.04 --> 1818.84]  and I will bring
[1818.84 --> 1819.50]  that to the grave
[1819.50 --> 1820.18]  and it will be
[1820.18 --> 1820.80]  finished there
[1820.80 --> 1822.26]  the battle
[1822.26 --> 1823.16]  will be won there
[1823.16 --> 1825.40]  not only that
[1825.40 --> 1827.72]  I will break death
[1827.72 --> 1828.92]  and rise to life
[1828.92 --> 1830.86]  and forever hold
[1830.86 --> 1831.84]  the keys of resurrection
[1831.84 --> 1832.84]  or as the book
[1832.84 --> 1833.76]  of Revelation puts it
[1833.76 --> 1834.84]  I hold the keys
[1834.84 --> 1835.32]  of death
[1835.32 --> 1836.18]  and Hades
[1836.18 --> 1837.10]  and it goes
[1837.10 --> 1838.04]  to no one else
[1838.04 --> 1839.86]  Jesus the resurrected
[1839.86 --> 1840.28]  Lord
[1840.28 --> 1841.52]  holds them
[1841.52 --> 1844.80]  I'm the resurrection
[1844.80 --> 1847.92]  there are two words
[1847.92 --> 1850.32]  that I find very striking
[1850.32 --> 1850.92]  in the New Testament
[1850.92 --> 1851.84]  to describe Jesus'
[1851.96 --> 1852.64]  resurrection
[1852.64 --> 1853.54]  the first is
[1853.54 --> 1854.86]  first fruits
[1854.86 --> 1856.46]  the second
[1856.46 --> 1857.56]  is pioneer
[1857.56 --> 1858.82]  and the New Testament
[1858.82 --> 1859.78]  writers are finding
[1859.78 --> 1860.26]  images
[1860.26 --> 1861.34]  that describe
[1861.34 --> 1862.10]  what Jesus did
[1862.10 --> 1862.74]  in his resurrection
[1862.74 --> 1863.46]  they both get
[1863.46 --> 1864.20]  at the same thing
[1864.20 --> 1865.02]  they both get
[1865.02 --> 1865.80]  at Jesus doing
[1865.80 --> 1866.68]  first what's going
[1866.68 --> 1867.00]  to happen
[1867.00 --> 1867.40]  for everyone
[1867.40 --> 1868.18]  who believes in him
[1868.18 --> 1869.30]  Jesus the first fruits
[1869.30 --> 1869.78]  who rises
[1869.78 --> 1870.68]  the crop that comes up
[1870.68 --> 1871.36]  he's the first one
[1871.36 --> 1872.00]  and the rest
[1872.00 --> 1872.44]  of the harvest
[1872.44 --> 1872.86]  is coming
[1872.86 --> 1874.08]  Jesus the pioneer
[1874.08 --> 1874.90]  who you might say
[1874.90 --> 1875.82]  breaks through
[1875.82 --> 1876.90]  the door of death
[1876.90 --> 1877.64]  and then opens
[1877.64 --> 1877.98]  that door
[1877.98 --> 1878.56]  for everyone
[1878.56 --> 1879.22]  who believes
[1879.22 --> 1880.16]  to enter with him
[1880.16 --> 1881.22]  into resurrection life
[1881.22 --> 1883.62]  I'm the resurrection
[1883.62 --> 1884.18]  and the life
[1884.18 --> 1886.48]  and Jesus is always
[1886.48 --> 1887.80]  throughout his ministry
[1887.80 --> 1889.56]  after defeating death
[1889.56 --> 1890.66]  bringing it to its
[1890.66 --> 1891.82]  final finish
[1891.82 --> 1892.96]  and opening up life
[1892.96 --> 1893.32]  and saying
[1893.32 --> 1894.48]  anyone who believes
[1894.48 --> 1894.94]  in me
[1894.94 --> 1896.48]  resurrection
[1896.48 --> 1899.44]  I'm the resurrection
[1899.44 --> 1901.76]  and let me finish
[1901.76 --> 1902.18]  with this
[1902.18 --> 1902.88]  beautiful
[1902.88 --> 1903.42]  important
[1903.42 --> 1904.32]  point of hope
[1904.32 --> 1906.60]  there is a day
[1906.60 --> 1906.98]  coming
[1906.98 --> 1909.00]  when Jesus
[1909.00 --> 1909.56]  will return
[1909.56 --> 1910.72]  and I'm praying
[1910.72 --> 1911.44]  more for that day
[1911.44 --> 1911.88]  than I prayed
[1911.88 --> 1912.54]  a long time ago
[1912.54 --> 1913.14]  because I really
[1913.14 --> 1913.82]  want that to happen
[1913.82 --> 1914.52]  sooner than later
[1914.52 --> 1916.76]  Jesus is coming
[1916.76 --> 1918.52]  and he has promised
[1918.52 --> 1919.28]  that when that day
[1919.28 --> 1919.76]  comes
[1919.76 --> 1920.98]  he's going to speak
[1920.98 --> 1921.88]  words of life
[1921.88 --> 1922.92]  over many tombs
[1922.92 --> 1923.94]  and people will rise
[1923.94 --> 1925.44]  he's going to speak
[1925.44 --> 1926.38]  words over your tomb
[1926.38 --> 1927.08]  if you're in Christ
[1927.08 --> 1927.48]  and say
[1927.48 --> 1928.86]  get out of the tomb
[1928.86 --> 1930.52]  rise to life
[1930.52 --> 1932.80]  Pete
[1932.80 --> 1934.40]  Robert
[1934.40 --> 1935.72]  Felix
[1935.72 --> 1936.76]  Caitlin
[1936.76 --> 1937.76]  Lauren
[1937.76 --> 1938.78]  Grace
[1938.78 --> 1939.68]  Rob
[1939.68 --> 1940.38]  Steve
[1940.38 --> 1941.84]  rise up out of the tomb
[1941.84 --> 1943.68]  your time has come
[1943.68 --> 1945.32]  the resurrection has come
[1945.32 --> 1946.60]  you have been in me
[1946.60 --> 1947.58]  and now you share
[1947.58 --> 1948.06]  in my life
[1948.06 --> 1949.02]  get out of the tomb
[1949.02 --> 1950.14]  take off the linens
[1950.14 --> 1951.72]  you now get to live
[1951.72 --> 1953.30]  life forever
[1953.30 --> 1955.28]  and I want to finish
[1955.28 --> 1956.32]  with Jesus' own question
[1956.32 --> 1956.88]  for us
[1956.88 --> 1958.04]  that he puts to Mary
[1958.04 --> 1958.74]  or Martha
[1958.74 --> 1960.50]  Hope Community Church
[1960.50 --> 1962.86]  do you believe that?
[1965.10 --> 1965.76]  let's pray
[1965.76 --> 1972.86]  Father I pray
[1972.86 --> 1973.52]  that you'd give us
[1973.52 --> 1974.02]  faith
[1974.02 --> 1975.46]  where there is doubt
[1975.46 --> 1977.90]  I pray that you
[1977.90 --> 1978.48]  would enable us
[1978.48 --> 1979.54]  to see and believe
[1979.54 --> 1980.18]  that the Jesus
[1980.18 --> 1980.76]  we worship
[1980.76 --> 1982.44]  is present to us
[1982.44 --> 1983.00]  in our grief
[1983.00 --> 1983.66]  with his tears
[1983.66 --> 1985.02]  and he is present
[1985.02 --> 1985.48]  to us
[1985.48 --> 1986.70]  with resurrection power
[1986.70 --> 1988.58]  I pray
[1988.58 --> 1989.20]  specifically
[1989.20 --> 1989.68]  for people
[1989.68 --> 1990.18]  going through
[1990.18 --> 1990.86]  deep grief
[1990.86 --> 1991.34]  right now
[1991.34 --> 1992.30]  over lost ones
[1992.30 --> 1992.92]  or health
[1992.92 --> 1993.64]  or pain
[1993.64 --> 1995.16]  or relational breakdown
[1995.16 --> 1996.10]  I ask Jesus
[1996.10 --> 1996.70]  that you come
[1996.70 --> 1997.42]  into those places
[1997.42 --> 1998.62]  with strength
[1998.62 --> 1999.58]  that only you can bring
[1999.58 --> 2000.30]  by your spirit
[2000.30 --> 2002.20]  and Lord
[2002.20 --> 2002.50]  I pray
[2002.50 --> 2003.26]  that you'd fill us
[2003.26 --> 2003.78]  as a body
[2003.78 --> 2004.26]  with hope
[2004.26 --> 2004.78]  that death
[2004.78 --> 2005.98]  is not the end
[2005.98 --> 2007.44]  and therefore
[2007.44 --> 2008.24]  we do not need
[2008.24 --> 2008.74]  to fear it
[2008.74 --> 2009.80]  because your tomb
[2009.80 --> 2010.92]  is empty
[2010.92 --> 2012.60]  and you stand
[2012.60 --> 2013.80]  as a resurrection Lord
[2013.80 --> 2014.46]  who holds
[2014.46 --> 2015.10]  the keys
[2015.10 --> 2016.08]  of death
[2016.08 --> 2017.86]  thank you
[2017.86 --> 2018.50]  for battling
[2018.50 --> 2019.30]  for us
[2019.30 --> 2020.58]  thank you
[2020.58 --> 2021.26]  for rising
[2021.26 --> 2022.10]  for us
[2022.10 --> 2023.30]  and thank you
[2023.30 --> 2024.10]  for bringing us
[2024.10 --> 2024.66]  with you
[2024.66 --> 2026.22]  into resurrection life
[2026.22 --> 2027.22]  amen
[2027.22 --> 2030.60]  I invite you
[2030.60 --> 2031.34]  to stand now
[2031.34 --> 2032.68]  and sing our closing song
[2032.68 --> 2034.20]  a song of exaltation
[2034.20 --> 2035.22]  of Jesus' resurrection
[2035.22 --> 2035.28] ux mate
