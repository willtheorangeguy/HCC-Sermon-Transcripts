• Completion of sermon series on John
• Recommissioning of Peter in John 21:15-19
• Jesus' dialogue with Peter about love and ministry responsibility
• Peter's past failures, including his denials of Jesus
• Jesus' act of forgiveness and recommissioning of Peter
• Jesus questions Peter about his love, specifically asking if he loves him more than the other disciples
• The context of these questions is rooted in Peter's past denials of Jesus and his need for restoration
• Jesus' question "do you love me" is a piercing one that gets to the heart of the Christian faith and Peter's relationship with Jesus
• Jesus pairs this question with commissioning, implying that love is not just about feelings but also about action and service
• The three questions are:
  • Do you love me?
  • Feed my lambs (or sheep)
  • Take care of my sheep
• The commission given to Peter is simple: to feed the church and take care of it, which involves teaching and nurturing young believers in their relationship with Jesus
• The importance of feeding God's sheep with the life of the gospel as a challenge for pastors
• The essence of being a leader in the church is taking care of it, demonstrated by Jesus' recommissioning of Peter
• The difference between leaders who "have a lot to say" and those who truly care for their flock
• The example of Pastor Sid Vanderwood's selflessness and presence with his congregation
• The recognition that the church belongs to Jesus Christ, not its leaders or denomination
• The transformative effect of recognizing this truth on the life of the church and its leaders
• Peter's commissioning by Jesus, including his promise of future persecution and martyrdom
• The warning to the church that discipleship is not about comfort but about following Jesus, even in difficult circumstances
• Peter's story represents the church's struggles and failures
• Jesus' promise to Peter that he will rise with Him is also a promise to all believers
• The church can relate to Peter's impulsive and weak behavior, but Jesus looks at them with love and forgiveness, asking only if they love Him
• Jesus offers new life and work for the believer despite past failures and sin
• His grace is sufficient and abundant for the believer to overcome weakness and continue in ministry
• The story of Peter serves as a reminder that believers are not written off by their worst failures, but rather equipped with God's strength to do the ministry they were called to.
• The importance of John's writings in demonstrating Jesus' divinity
• Believing in Jesus leads to life in His name
• Importance of prayer and receiving God's forgiveness and commission
• Living according to God's story and relying on His strength and sufficiency
• Serving God and making His name known in the world
