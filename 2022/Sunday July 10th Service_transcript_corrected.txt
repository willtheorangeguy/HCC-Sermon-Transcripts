[0.00 → 16.96] Boy, they're noisy, aren't they?
[19.08 → 21.44] Beautiful to see all the children,
[22.00 → 26.20] and so grateful to see all that energy
[26.20 → 28.96] and all that cuteness.
[28.96 → 30.24] Nice to see the children.
[31.30 → 32.44] Again, good morning to you all.
[33.34 → 34.82] I should have introduced myself earlier.
[34.90 → 35.70] For those of you who don't know me,
[35.76 → 37.46] I'm Pastor Sid Vander wood,
[37.56 → 39.02] one of the pastors here at Hope Community.
[39.96 → 42.72] I'm going to continue in our summer series,
[42.88 → 44.14] and that summer series is called
[44.14 → 46.74] Honest to God, Praying the Psalms.
[47.92 → 49.82] And Jonathan started off last week
[49.82 → 51.04] preaching on Psalm 1,
[51.80 → 53.88] where he talked about honest prayers,
[54.64 → 57.74] about a wide range of emotions dealt with,
[57.74 → 59.30] and we deal with those honestly
[59.30 → 60.60] and then prayerfully.
[61.28 → 63.66] Heartfelt emotions being poured out to God.
[64.10 → 65.18] That's what we see in the Psalms.
[65.50 → 67.06] Our whole lives,
[67.18 → 69.12] our whole lives brought to God.
[70.76 → 74.02] But the Psalms require us to face life
[74.02 → 77.06] the way it really is at this time.
[77.06 → 80.68] It's about facing the good and the bad.
[81.84 → 84.58] And then we realize with this honest appraisal
[84.58 → 87.26] that, yeah, things can be pretty bad sometimes
[87.26 → 88.82] and pretty wonderful too.
[89.92 → 92.20] Life is hard, life is wonderful,
[92.38 → 93.28] and everything in between.
[93.80 → 96.92] And we realize that not everyone likes us,
[97.02 → 99.64] nor do we like everyone around us.
[99.64 → 101.02] We're supposed to love,
[101.38 → 103.78] but we don't necessarily always like.
[105.14 → 106.26] And in the Psalms,
[106.86 → 109.44] we see facing one's enemies
[109.44 → 111.52] as a part of living.
[113.00 → 116.60] A lot of enemies' talk is in the Psalms
[116.60 → 118.02] when you start seeing it.
[118.44 → 119.18] And some of you might say,
[119.24 → 120.26] well, enemies, come on now.
[120.42 → 122.68] You know, and I'm going to expand
[122.68 → 124.30] the definition of enemies a little bit.
[124.30 → 126.30] You might have a personal enemy
[126.96 → 128.82] where you have an issue with someone.
[129.02 → 129.98] That's part of it.
[130.28 → 130.86] But I'm going to say
[130.86 → 132.44] maybe some of the enemies within too.
[133.30 → 134.76] Some of the enemies might be
[134.76 → 136.60] issues and problems around you.
[136.74 → 137.74] So there are a lot of ways
[137.74 → 139.08] we can look at enemies.
[141.12 → 141.98] And in prayer,
[143.32 → 144.22] we grapple.
[144.30 → 145.50] We see this is what David is doing.
[145.54 → 147.34] We grapple, we fight, we wrestle.
[147.86 → 149.30] We battle those foes
[149.30 → 151.46] that are within and without.
[151.46 → 154.32] And prayer, hopefully,
[154.44 → 155.84] eventually brings harmony and peace,
[156.20 → 160.04] but only after we face those enemies.
[161.42 → 163.08] You can't just ignore them.
[163.70 → 165.38] And when you read the Psalms,
[165.44 → 166.42] sometimes you might say,
[166.52 → 168.86] wow, they're alarmingly honest.
[170.54 → 171.52] Alarmingly honest.
[172.98 → 175.02] I remember as I was a teacher
[175.02 → 175.88] for many years,
[176.00 → 178.18] and I remember asking my students
[178.18 → 178.82] at the time,
[178.90 → 179.98] I taught in a Christian school,
[179.98 → 180.84] and I asked them,
[181.44 → 184.54] is all the Bible worth memorizing?
[186.44 → 190.30] And they know that the answer
[190.30 → 191.80] should be, yes, it is.
[192.90 → 194.12] And then I read the verse
[194.12 → 196.06] where David prays that his enemies'
[196.40 → 198.24] babies are smashed against the rocks.
[198.64 → 199.96] And I said, that verse too?
[202.16 → 204.66] And these were junior high students.
[204.66 → 206.92] And they were taken aback,
[207.02 → 208.68] as I had intended.
[210.08 → 212.12] Because for David to say such a thing
[212.12 → 213.38] is horrifying.
[215.14 → 216.48] Was that worth memorizing?
[216.48 → 218.46] No, I probably wouldn't memorize that one.
[219.62 → 225.12] But the Psalms are gut-wrenchingly honest.
[225.12 → 228.82] I sometimes almost feel like they're like,
[229.30 → 232.44] the teenager yells at their parent,
[232.64 → 233.94] I hate you!
[236.16 → 236.64] Right?
[236.80 → 239.02] You know, and these emotion rises up,
[239.32 → 242.58] and things are said that probably should not be said.
[242.94 → 245.78] Some of the Psalms feel that way.
[245.78 → 249.42] And their prayers.
[252.26 → 253.76] Eugene Peterson writes,
[254.10 → 254.78] in the Psalms,
[254.96 → 256.84] God is the primary subject.
[257.38 → 259.22] But, enemies are established
[259.22 → 261.06] in a solid second place.
[262.38 → 262.96] He goes on,
[263.00 → 264.66] when we take the Psalms as our guide,
[265.08 → 266.74] we find that people who pray
[266.74 → 268.06] have a lot of enemies,
[268.22 → 269.76] and they spend a lot of their praying
[269.76 → 270.72] dealing with them.
[270.94 → 271.44] In other words,
[271.70 → 273.56] they're aware of the conflicts,
[273.66 → 274.32] and the brokenness,
[274.36 → 274.90] and the messiness,
[274.90 → 275.74] within and without.
[276.24 → 278.00] They're aware of the enemies.
[278.46 → 279.50] They're not hiding.
[282.54 → 284.12] Which is the right place,
[284.24 → 285.58] and the right way to deal with enemies.
[287.04 → 288.62] So let's look at our Psalm today.
[288.78 → 289.50] Psalm 3.
[290.72 → 291.50] A Psalm of David.
[291.56 → 292.10] Notice how it starts.
[292.18 → 292.88] A Psalm of David,
[292.94 → 294.66] when he fled from his son Absalom.
[295.10 → 295.80] You already hear,
[295.92 → 296.94] whoa, what, what?
[297.28 → 298.16] A Psalm of David,
[298.16 → 300.56] when he fled from his own son.
[302.52 → 304.08] Oh, you already should have
[304.08 → 304.94] a bit of a gut punch.
[306.34 → 307.64] So let's read it together.
[307.64 → 309.54] Lord, Lord,
[309.88 → 311.92] how many are my foes?
[312.64 → 314.90] How many rise up against me?
[315.84 → 317.86] Many are saying of me,
[318.34 → 320.70] God will not deliver him.
[321.70 → 322.96] But you, Lord,
[323.30 → 325.00] are a shield around me,
[325.22 → 325.90] my glory,
[326.02 → 327.70] the one who lifts my head high.
[327.70 → 329.62] And I call out to the Lord,
[329.96 → 332.18] and he answers me from his holy mountain.
[333.98 → 336.18] I lie down and sleep.
[337.48 → 338.70] I wake again,
[338.78 → 340.20] because the Lord sustains me.
[341.24 → 342.18] I will not fear,
[342.30 → 344.70] though tens of thousands
[344.70 → 346.20] assail me on every side.
[346.94 → 347.92] Arise, Lord.
[349.38 → 350.34] Deliver me,
[350.74 → 351.42] my God.
[352.30 → 354.10] Strike all my enemies on the jaw.
[354.10 → 355.86] Break the teeth of the wicked.
[357.02 → 358.68] From the Lord comes deliverance.
[359.84 → 361.20] May you're blessing is
[361.20 → 362.94] on your people.
[364.74 → 366.40] And the psalmist is saying,
[366.98 → 368.02] for him at that point,
[368.12 → 369.60] life is really hard right now.
[370.66 → 371.78] So much stress,
[372.04 → 372.94] so much pressure.
[374.10 → 374.44] He's saying,
[374.58 → 376.88] my family is a mess.
[378.12 → 380.52] My own son is an enemy.
[380.52 → 386.70] There are enemies everywhere,
[387.16 → 388.50] and I don't know what to do.
[388.56 → 389.26] That's what he's saying.
[389.58 → 390.36] And so God,
[390.96 → 392.70] do something.
[393.92 → 394.80] Do something.
[395.76 → 396.74] Basically praying,
[397.10 → 397.78] Lord, right now,
[397.86 → 398.70] I'm hating life,
[398.92 → 400.46] and I'm going to tell you about it.
[400.80 → 401.68] And I'm going to ask you,
[401.74 → 403.14] does that ever sound like
[403.14 → 404.64] your prayer life?
[405.54 → 406.82] Or are your prayers
[406.82 → 407.82] much prettier?
[407.82 → 413.04] We see raw prayers
[413.04 → 414.78] coming out of David often.
[415.38 → 416.48] There's no pretending
[416.48 → 418.06] it's all good,
[418.26 → 420.58] because it isn't.
[421.96 → 423.12] David says,
[423.80 → 425.08] so many are against me,
[425.14 → 426.26] including my own son,
[426.44 → 426.90] Absalom,
[427.54 → 428.40] who is leading
[428.40 → 429.44] what looks like
[429.44 → 430.48] a successful rebellion
[430.48 → 431.56] against his own dad.
[432.66 → 433.80] And David's on the run.
[434.16 → 435.86] He's had to flee the capital.
[435.86 → 436.76] He had to leave
[436.76 → 437.70] the throne behind.
[438.02 → 438.66] The throne
[438.66 → 440.02] that was supposedly
[440.02 → 441.38] promised by God
[441.38 → 443.04] to be in his line
[443.04 → 444.04] forever.
[445.70 → 446.22] Forever.
[448.74 → 450.28] The line that was supposed
[450.28 → 451.52] to produce the Messiah,
[451.86 → 453.12] the ultimate deliverer.
[453.36 → 454.42] And you can read the story
[454.42 → 456.30] of Absalom and David
[456.30 → 458.92] starting around 2 Samuel 15.
[459.12 → 460.10] Go ahead and take a look at it.
[460.50 → 461.36] And Absalom,
[461.48 → 462.76] let me summarize a bit of it though.
[462.76 → 464.38] Absalom had found out
[464.38 → 466.32] that David's oldest son
[466.32 → 469.18] had raped his half-sister
[469.18 → 470.38] Tamar.
[471.98 → 473.50] And she comes to Absalom.
[474.90 → 476.54] And Absalom goes to David,
[477.04 → 478.08] but not much happens.
[479.50 → 480.78] Absalom eventually murders
[480.78 → 481.60] his half-brother
[481.60 → 483.06] and then flees into exile.
[483.06 → 486.02] And now he's leading a coup
[486.02 → 487.22] against his dad,
[487.30 → 487.70] the king.
[488.06 → 488.52] And you say,
[488.52 → 491.68] what an unbelievable mess.
[492.84 → 493.22] Rape,
[493.88 → 494.28] murder,
[495.10 → 495.60] a coup
[495.60 → 496.74] against your own dad.
[498.04 → 499.88] What a mess.
[499.88 → 504.54] And yet David is the Lord's anointed.
[505.20 → 506.56] Scripture says David is the man
[506.56 → 507.62] after God's own heart.
[508.54 → 509.42] That's grace.
[510.54 → 511.16] That's grace.
[511.60 → 512.64] David understood that much.
[513.14 → 513.60] And yeah,
[513.72 → 515.82] it's a huge mess.
[516.26 → 517.42] And then we can think back
[517.42 → 517.88] of David
[517.88 → 518.54] and the whole story
[518.54 → 519.32] of Bathsheba
[519.32 → 520.40] and the murdering
[520.40 → 522.04] of Bathsheba's husband Uriah.
[522.44 → 522.62] I mean,
[522.66 → 524.14] no wonder David runs.
[524.44 → 526.04] No wonder people are saying,
[526.32 → 526.46] hey,
[526.60 → 527.88] God's left that guy.
[527.98 → 529.08] What an awful life
[529.08 → 529.52] he's living.
[529.88 → 530.88] No wonder he has
[530.88 → 532.18] so many enemies.
[535.46 → 536.78] Maybe you can relate
[536.78 → 537.46] to a degree.
[539.72 → 540.86] Maybe you've said sometimes,
[541.04 → 542.22] I have made such
[542.22 → 543.66] a mess of things.
[543.98 → 544.68] My marriage,
[544.82 → 545.42] my family,
[545.58 → 546.12] my life,
[546.24 → 546.76] my friendship.
[547.00 → 548.10] I've made such a mess.
[548.34 → 550.30] I've made so many enemies.
[550.96 → 552.20] They're all around me.
[555.10 → 556.48] They're in my own household.
[559.52 → 562.52] Maybe you quit talking years ago.
[563.58 → 565.06] Maybe you quit getting together.
[565.18 → 566.12] You don't do that anymore.
[566.26 → 567.22] All kinds of issues
[567.22 → 568.22] and you can't find your way
[568.22 → 568.88] through them all.
[569.76 → 570.66] And you know,
[570.74 → 572.24] and then you might ask,
[572.32 → 572.42] well,
[572.56 → 573.92] is this the time for prayer?
[573.98 → 574.52] I don't know.
[574.94 → 575.66] And the answer is,
[575.66 → 575.84] yes,
[575.88 → 576.76] this is the time for prayer.
[576.98 → 578.02] That's where David starts.
[578.06 → 579.00] You look at the very first word.
[579.00 → 579.72] Lord,
[580.04 → 580.56] Lord,
[580.80 → 582.16] so many enemies.
[583.66 → 585.90] So many enemies.
[590.70 → 591.76] Many are saying,
[591.88 → 592.22] David said,
[592.24 → 592.68] many are saying,
[592.76 → 592.98] maybe,
[593.36 → 594.50] maybe I think it too.
[594.72 → 595.96] I doubt that God
[595.96 → 596.84] will deliver that guy.
[598.12 → 599.42] He's beyond that.
[600.76 → 602.30] When it's all falling apart,
[603.04 → 604.14] is this where you go?
[604.36 → 605.26] Do you go to raw,
[605.42 → 606.18] raw prayers?
[606.68 → 607.66] Or do you pretend?
[607.98 → 608.84] Or do you blame?
[609.10 → 609.78] Or do you hide?
[610.00 → 610.66] Or do you defend?
[610.98 → 611.98] Or do you play the victim?
[612.22 → 613.12] Or do you attack?
[613.90 → 615.44] There are a lot of ways to respond.
[615.96 → 618.28] But David goes first and foremost,
[618.76 → 619.10] oh,
[619.30 → 619.94] Lord.
[621.76 → 622.44] He goes to prayer.
[622.82 → 624.44] He lays it all out before God.
[624.58 → 625.06] Lord,
[625.46 → 626.04] the one,
[626.26 → 626.78] he says,
[626.86 → 627.80] is his shepherd.
[627.80 → 629.32] The Lord is my shepherd.
[629.52 → 630.02] He guides,
[630.12 → 630.54] he leads,
[630.80 → 632.38] he brings me to the green pasture.
[632.68 → 633.72] That's the one.
[633.72 → 636.64] So many enemies,
[637.60 → 638.62] including my son,
[638.68 → 639.54] whom I deeply love.
[641.90 → 643.12] And then when you jump ahead
[643.12 → 643.80] to verse three,
[643.94 → 645.20] you see it starts with the word,
[646.02 → 646.24] but.
[647.00 → 647.28] But,
[647.34 → 648.50] this is a powerful word here.
[648.90 → 649.68] But you,
[649.94 → 650.22] Lord,
[650.60 → 650.84] you,
[651.00 → 651.18] Lord,
[651.24 → 653.28] are my shield around me.
[653.54 → 653.92] You,
[654.08 → 654.28] Lord,
[654.32 → 655.20] are my glory.
[655.20 → 656.78] You lift my head
[656.78 → 657.92] when I'm downcast.
[658.06 → 659.48] I cry out loud to you
[659.48 → 661.54] and you answer me.
[664.34 → 665.14] People are saying,
[665.22 → 666.10] God won't deliver me,
[666.16 → 667.20] but I know he will.
[667.30 → 667.58] He will.
[667.66 → 668.68] He has and he will.
[669.04 → 669.34] And he,
[669.40 → 670.66] he bestows glory.
[670.80 → 672.08] He lifts my head again.
[672.12 → 673.08] That's what I'm counting on.
[673.70 → 674.00] And then,
[674.38 → 675.80] then notice what happens next
[675.80 → 676.34] in verse five.
[676.44 → 676.92] David says,
[677.36 → 678.48] and then I lay down
[678.48 → 680.82] and I sleep.
[680.82 → 685.30] And then I wake up
[685.30 → 686.66] knowing you sustain me
[686.66 → 687.12] yet again.
[688.56 → 689.52] No more fear
[689.52 → 690.34] in the face
[690.34 → 691.88] of overwhelming odds
[691.88 → 694.02] and unreal problems.
[695.70 → 696.42] And we might ask,
[696.50 → 697.14] what changed?
[697.60 → 698.34] What changed?
[699.26 → 699.40] Well,
[699.42 → 699.74] I have to be,
[699.80 → 700.36] to be honest,
[700.36 → 701.40] mainly his focus.
[701.68 → 702.62] And it started with prayer.
[702.86 → 703.96] His focus changed.
[704.26 → 705.48] It's off the enemies,
[705.64 → 706.44] off the issues,
[706.56 → 707.36] off the problems.
[707.74 → 708.74] He shared it all
[708.74 → 710.14] and then he refocused
[710.14 → 711.30] on the one
[711.30 → 712.90] who lifts his head.
[713.18 → 714.04] And I just see this
[714.04 → 714.92] sunken head.
[715.26 → 716.68] You're beaten down by life.
[716.88 → 717.66] And there's this God
[717.66 → 718.70] who lifts your head
[718.70 → 720.12] and you see again.
[720.46 → 721.22] Instead of the focus
[721.22 → 721.84] down here,
[722.12 → 723.42] the focus is here
[723.42 → 725.50] on the one
[725.50 → 726.14] who delivers.
[727.56 → 728.12] Are the enemies
[728.12 → 728.64] still there?
[728.74 → 728.92] Yeah,
[729.00 → 729.18] yeah,
[729.18 → 729.62] they are.
[730.84 → 732.14] Is he still on the run?
[732.24 → 732.42] Yeah,
[732.50 → 733.08] he is.
[734.82 → 735.66] That's why I love
[735.66 → 737.10] Psalm 23
[737.10 → 737.62] when he writes,
[737.62 → 739.20] you prepare a table
[739.20 → 739.76] before me.
[739.86 → 740.06] Where?
[740.28 → 741.02] Where do you prepare
[741.02 → 741.52] a table before me?
[741.68 → 742.84] In the midst,
[742.90 → 743.56] in the presence
[743.56 → 744.36] of my enemy,
[744.58 → 745.42] in the middle
[745.42 → 746.18] of the mess.
[746.58 → 747.36] That's when you
[747.36 → 748.12] nourish me.
[750.08 → 750.78] That's what I need
[750.78 → 751.18] at most,
[751.26 → 751.48] right?
[752.22 → 752.84] And then,
[752.90 → 753.02] yeah,
[753.10 → 754.00] then you anoint my head
[754.00 → 754.92] and my cup overflows
[754.92 → 755.64] and surely goodness
[755.64 → 756.82] and love will follow me
[756.82 → 757.54] all the days of my life
[757.54 → 758.00] and I will dwell
[758.00 → 758.64] in the house of the Lord
[758.64 → 758.94] forever.
[759.14 → 759.76] You see the focus
[759.76 → 760.38] change again.
[761.48 → 762.70] It's off the enemies
[762.70 → 764.54] and on to the Lord.
[764.54 → 770.40] When I spend my time
[770.40 → 770.82] and energy
[770.82 → 771.92] stewing on the problems,
[773.02 → 774.08] on certain people,
[774.32 → 775.38] on certain issues,
[775.52 → 776.44] rehearsing the issues,
[776.86 → 778.26] acting like I'm going
[778.26 → 779.04] to have to solve
[779.04 → 779.74] the situation,
[780.12 → 781.66] I'll be the deliverer.
[781.84 → 782.46] That's what's going
[782.46 → 782.68] to happen.
[782.74 → 783.40] I'll be the deliverer.
[783.60 → 784.64] I'll be really smart.
[784.92 → 785.74] I'll be brilliant
[785.74 → 786.56] with my logic
[786.56 → 787.48] and my language.
[787.72 → 789.34] I'll solve the issue.
[790.46 → 790.96] Well, guess what?
[790.98 → 791.84] I don't sleep well
[791.84 → 792.62] when it's up to me.
[792.62 → 795.28] I really don't.
[797.18 → 797.62] Sleep,
[798.08 → 798.64] interesting enough,
[798.72 → 799.84] is a daily reminder
[799.84 → 801.58] that we have to rest
[801.58 → 803.02] in the Lord.
[804.76 → 806.36] That we are not God,
[806.62 → 807.64] we are not in control,
[807.80 → 808.80] we are not the creator,
[808.92 → 810.12] but we are the creation.
[811.28 → 812.54] And we need rest
[812.54 → 814.56] and God sustains.
[815.56 → 816.90] It doesn't ultimately
[816.90 → 817.74] depend on us
[817.74 → 818.92] and so we start with,
[820.12 → 821.16] oh, Lord.
[822.62 → 824.38] and it's the beginning
[824.38 → 825.64] of handing it over
[825.64 → 826.34] to the Lord
[826.34 → 828.44] and taking our focus
[828.44 → 829.22] off of this
[829.22 → 830.78] and bringing it here.
[832.58 → 833.20] Another Psalm,
[833.30 → 833.76] David says,
[833.84 → 833.96] you know,
[833.98 → 834.92] I lift my eyes
[834.92 → 835.44] to the hills
[835.44 → 835.94] and I just,
[836.34 → 837.66] I love that image again.
[837.72 → 837.86] You know,
[837.86 → 838.76] I'm looking down here
[838.76 → 840.56] and I lift my eyes
[840.56 → 841.16] to the Lord,
[842.12 → 842.74] to the hills,
[842.82 → 843.20] the hill where
[843.20 → 843.78] the Lord comes.
[843.78 → 847.94] Carl Barth,
[847.94 → 849.30] the famous theologian,
[849.88 → 851.34] said of folded hands
[851.34 → 851.62] and I,
[851.96 → 852.84] there's a quote here.
[853.52 → 853.76] It says,
[853.86 → 855.76] to clasp hands in prayer
[855.76 → 857.28] is the beginning
[857.28 → 858.58] of an uprising
[858.58 → 860.56] against the disorder
[860.56 → 861.66] of the world.
[865.82 → 867.12] Do you believe that
[867.12 → 868.06] when you pray?
[868.06 → 870.82] that you are praying
[870.82 → 873.32] as an act of rebellion
[873.32 → 874.34] against the disorder
[874.34 → 874.92] of the world?
[877.22 → 878.22] Think about that.
[881.66 → 882.90] We all want power.
[883.90 → 885.30] We all want to fix things.
[886.42 → 887.32] Especially we men.
[887.32 → 889.92] And scripture keeps
[889.92 → 890.72] pointing us
[890.72 → 891.66] to the power
[891.66 → 892.84] of surrender
[892.84 → 893.90] in prayer.
[897.12 → 898.48] Praying isn't simply
[898.48 → 899.90] a little quiet time.
[900.54 → 901.16] It can be that.
[901.72 → 902.48] There's nothing wrong
[902.48 → 903.26] with the quiet time.
[903.30 → 903.72] That's good.
[904.36 → 905.66] But it is an act
[905.66 → 907.18] of powerful surrender.
[907.56 → 907.98] It is saying,
[908.34 → 909.08] I surrender
[909.08 → 910.38] my will
[910.38 → 911.12] to the will
[911.12 → 911.76] of the one
[911.76 → 912.78] who has the power
[912.78 → 913.96] to make a difference.
[914.84 → 915.42] Prayer is about
[915.42 → 916.52] bringing God's kingdom
[916.52 → 917.20] in reality
[917.20 → 918.28] and realizing
[918.28 → 920.08] only God brings it.
[921.96 → 922.84] And I do my part
[922.84 → 923.66] out of that.
[924.72 → 925.74] Because I'm not suggesting
[925.74 → 926.58] we don't do our part.
[926.70 → 927.38] We must live
[927.38 → 928.02] with the reality
[928.02 → 928.84] that when we pray
[928.84 → 929.92] we invite the Almighty
[929.92 → 930.68] into the mess
[930.68 → 932.90] and then we can act
[932.90 → 934.28] and yet rest.
[936.08 → 936.84] Because we,
[937.30 → 938.10] if we don't,
[938.28 → 939.22] we will be overwhelmed
[939.22 → 940.54] like David was at first.
[940.54 → 941.64] Oh Lord,
[942.04 → 943.74] there are too many enemies.
[943.94 → 944.42] Oh Lord,
[944.82 → 946.22] they don't think
[946.22 → 946.74] I'll be delivered.
[946.74 → 946.78] Lord,
[946.82 → 947.46] maybe I won't.
[947.60 → 948.86] And he's freaking out.
[949.20 → 949.60] And you see that
[949.60 → 950.48] elsewhere in the Psalms too.
[950.54 → 951.16] He's overwhelmed.
[954.26 → 954.66] Lord,
[954.90 → 955.46] I believe.
[955.58 → 956.84] I love this verse
[956.84 → 957.90] in the New Testament
[957.90 → 959.14] where the guy says,
[959.38 → 959.62] Jesus,
[959.74 → 961.36] heal my child.
[961.54 → 962.32] And Jesus said,
[962.34 → 962.80] do you believe?
[962.86 → 963.18] And he says,
[963.22 → 963.52] I believe.
[963.58 → 964.20] Help my unbelief.
[964.30 → 965.42] We believe in,
[965.50 → 965.84] we don't.
[966.44 → 967.08] We struggle.
[967.24 → 967.68] We wrestle.
[967.68 → 968.54] But we cling
[968.54 → 969.58] to the Lord
[969.58 → 971.06] who is right there
[971.06 → 971.44] with you.
[971.50 → 972.70] And he is the shield.
[973.12 → 974.12] He is the deliverer.
[974.12 → 975.60] And then I can let go
[975.60 → 976.84] of my human attempts
[976.84 → 977.84] to manage it all,
[978.18 → 979.08] comprehend it all,
[979.34 → 980.14] explain it all,
[980.40 → 981.26] overcome it all.
[981.26 → 986.64] You know,
[986.90 → 988.42] some of you
[988.42 → 988.80] in the midst
[988.80 → 989.36] of your struggle
[989.36 → 989.58] might say,
[989.62 → 991.10] how's it going to go?
[991.68 → 992.10] And the answer,
[992.18 → 993.08] I don't know.
[993.22 → 994.46] Not my problem,
[994.72 → 996.40] but the Almighty's problem.
[996.40 → 996.50] God,
[997.10 → 999.88] because he's with me.
[1002.12 → 1002.98] And then we jump ahead
[1002.98 → 1003.26] in that,
[1003.88 → 1006.10] to where David then says,
[1006.40 → 1007.64] arise, Lord.
[1007.78 → 1007.98] Right?
[1008.04 → 1008.56] He went from,
[1008.68 → 1009.32] oh, Lord.
[1009.54 → 1010.44] It's a mess.
[1010.48 → 1011.30] It's a disaster.
[1011.60 → 1012.44] And then he comes to,
[1012.72 → 1014.02] arise, Lord.
[1014.84 → 1015.92] Why does he say that?
[1015.92 → 1017.08] It's a call to action.
[1018.54 → 1019.12] And then this line,
[1019.32 → 1020.22] how about breaking
[1020.22 → 1021.22] some teeth, Lord?
[1023.02 → 1024.10] Is that ever in your prayers?
[1026.40 → 1027.38] You ever pray
[1027.38 → 1027.94] God might
[1027.94 → 1030.28] bust somebody's chops?
[1032.78 → 1033.84] Here David is seeing
[1033.84 → 1034.80] his enemies
[1034.80 → 1035.32] a little bit like
[1035.32 → 1035.90] wild animals
[1035.90 → 1036.82] with lots of teeth.
[1037.42 → 1037.98] And he says,
[1038.00 → 1038.92] so let's lose the teeth.
[1039.00 → 1039.94] Let's lose their power.
[1041.16 → 1042.02] Some of you might be thinking,
[1042.12 → 1042.30] you know,
[1042.34 → 1042.76] okay, well,
[1042.86 → 1042.98] yeah,
[1042.98 → 1043.64] but Jesus said,
[1043.64 → 1044.38] love your enemies.
[1044.46 → 1044.86] And that's right.
[1044.90 → 1045.58] He did say that.
[1046.34 → 1046.74] But again,
[1047.02 → 1048.32] David in his humanity
[1048.32 → 1049.66] prays these raw prayers
[1049.66 → 1050.46] from the heart.
[1051.30 → 1051.70] Right?
[1051.78 → 1052.58] And he's,
[1052.70 → 1053.50] you know,
[1053.58 → 1054.52] he's struggling.
[1056.40 → 1057.06] You know,
[1057.12 → 1058.34] that breaking of teeth,
[1058.42 → 1058.92] it reminded me
[1058.92 → 1059.94] of something Gandhi said.
[1060.12 → 1060.66] Gandhi said,
[1060.80 → 1061.66] if we take this,
[1061.76 → 1061.86] you know,
[1061.88 → 1062.90] you've heard the phrase,
[1062.98 → 1063.48] an eye for an eye
[1063.48 → 1064.28] and a tooth for a tooth,
[1064.34 → 1064.52] right?
[1064.96 → 1065.42] Gandhi said,
[1065.48 → 1066.28] if you take an eye
[1066.28 → 1066.56] for an eye
[1066.56 → 1067.84] and a tooth for a tooth
[1067.84 → 1069.34] to its logical conclusion,
[1069.76 → 1070.82] eventually the whole world
[1070.82 → 1071.94] will be blind and toothless.
[1074.60 → 1075.00] You know,
[1075.04 → 1075.26] there's,
[1076.00 → 1076.78] yeah,
[1076.84 → 1077.36] I guess if we all
[1077.36 → 1078.36] take a swing at each other
[1078.36 → 1079.16] and, you know,
[1079.16 → 1079.80] try to take it out
[1079.80 → 1080.32] on each other,
[1080.40 → 1081.80] it's going to leave
[1081.80 → 1082.44] a lot of damage.
[1082.82 → 1083.16] You know,
[1083.20 → 1084.44] Paul writes in Galatians,
[1084.44 → 1087.82] he writes in Galatians 5,
[1088.42 → 1088.72] he says,
[1088.84 → 1090.30] if you bite and devour
[1090.30 → 1090.80] each other
[1090.80 → 1092.14] because you do,
[1093.76 → 1094.00] right,
[1094.08 → 1094.66] I'm not saying it
[1094.66 → 1095.30] because it didn't happen,
[1095.34 → 1095.90] it was happening,
[1096.60 → 1097.26] watch out,
[1097.56 → 1098.80] watch out
[1098.80 → 1100.22] or you will be destroyed
[1100.22 → 1101.18] by each other,
[1101.40 → 1101.56] right,
[1101.62 → 1102.80] everyone loses.
[1103.24 → 1103.62] So I say,
[1103.74 → 1104.70] walk by the spirit
[1104.70 → 1106.28] and you will not gratify
[1106.28 → 1107.24] the desires of the flesh
[1107.24 → 1108.20] and the desires of the flesh
[1108.20 → 1108.52] might be,
[1108.60 → 1109.88] I'm going to bust your teeth up.
[1110.16 → 1110.96] You might have those
[1110.96 → 1111.50] kind of desires.
[1111.58 → 1112.30] I want revenge.
[1113.30 → 1114.36] I want to handle this myself.
[1115.34 → 1116.12] I'm strong.
[1116.24 → 1116.56] I'm brilliant.
[1116.64 → 1117.14] I'm powerful.
[1117.58 → 1118.58] I know how to argue.
[1118.70 → 1119.32] I know how to fight.
[1119.42 → 1120.14] I know how to whatever
[1120.14 → 1121.68] and you make it worse.
[1123.22 → 1123.36] Yeah,
[1123.36 → 1124.74] so maybe a few less teeth
[1124.74 → 1125.36] might be helpful
[1125.36 → 1125.62] but,
[1126.08 → 1126.76] and I doubt,
[1126.84 → 1127.70] I was thinking about this too,
[1127.98 → 1128.84] I doubt David
[1128.84 → 1130.32] in this enemy line
[1130.32 → 1132.22] was including the leader
[1132.22 → 1132.94] of the rebellion,
[1133.08 → 1133.62] his own son.
[1135.18 → 1136.02] It's one thing
[1136.02 → 1137.04] to think of a bunch
[1137.04 → 1137.92] of enemies,
[1138.66 → 1139.76] those people out there
[1139.76 → 1141.48] when it's your own kid.
[1141.48 → 1143.38] Lord,
[1143.90 → 1145.58] bust Absalom's teeth out.
[1148.02 → 1149.22] He's not saying that.
[1151.04 → 1152.14] He loves that kid.
[1153.52 → 1154.06] I think that's why
[1154.06 → 1154.70] Jesus would love
[1154.70 → 1155.44] your enemies too.
[1156.22 → 1157.48] When you love somebody,
[1158.12 → 1159.14] you don't start praying
[1159.14 → 1160.00] to bust their teeth.
[1161.30 → 1162.54] You know them somehow.
[1164.38 → 1164.82] Sometimes,
[1165.14 → 1166.14] when we deal with issues
[1166.14 → 1166.84] and problems,
[1167.06 → 1168.02] it's easier to leave it
[1168.02 → 1169.06] as issues and problems.
[1169.06 → 1170.80] It's harder when it's real people,
[1170.90 → 1171.86] isn't it?
[1172.10 → 1172.72] Especially people
[1172.72 → 1173.54] you love and know.
[1177.44 → 1178.26] It's interesting.
[1179.00 → 1180.18] The story of Absalom,
[1180.48 → 1183.66] it goes to the point
[1183.66 → 1184.86] where when David flees
[1184.86 → 1185.94] and eventually,
[1186.26 → 1188.72] God leads David's forces
[1188.72 → 1189.58] to victory
[1189.58 → 1191.36] and they've kind of got
[1191.36 → 1192.38] Absalom cornered
[1192.38 → 1194.44] and the men are after Absalom
[1194.44 → 1196.56] and then David says this
[1196.56 → 1197.20] to his men
[1197.20 → 1199.10] before they find Absalom
[1199.10 → 1200.04] and corner him somewhere.
[1200.30 → 1200.66] They said,
[1201.02 → 1201.90] for my sake,
[1203.06 → 1203.96] deal gently
[1203.96 → 1204.82] with the young man,
[1204.90 → 1205.30] Absalom.
[1209.02 → 1209.58] Yeah.
[1211.54 → 1212.64] Break their teeth
[1212.64 → 1213.70] but deal gently with him.
[1216.06 → 1217.28] That doesn't happen,
[1217.36 → 1217.82] by the way.
[1219.78 → 1221.14] One of David's men
[1221.14 → 1222.00] kills Absalom.
[1222.00 → 1224.54] The old famous story
[1224.54 → 1225.74] of the hair stuck in the tree.
[1225.94 → 1226.70] You can read about it.
[1228.58 → 1229.36] I'm going to read you
[1229.36 → 1231.62] 2 Samuel 18
[1231.62 → 1232.58] when David hears
[1232.58 → 1233.44] about his son's death.
[1236.28 → 1237.42] The king was shaken
[1237.42 → 1239.62] and he went up
[1239.62 → 1240.14] to the room
[1240.14 → 1240.88] over the gateway
[1240.88 → 1241.38] and wept
[1241.38 → 1242.12] and as he went,
[1242.22 → 1242.46] he said,
[1242.52 → 1243.54] oh my son Absalom,
[1243.80 → 1244.58] my son,
[1244.72 → 1246.20] my son Absalom,
[1246.52 → 1248.42] if only I had died
[1248.42 → 1249.54] instead of you,
[1249.88 → 1250.68] oh Absalom,
[1250.86 → 1251.66] my son.
[1252.00 → 1253.34] my son.
[1257.78 → 1258.98] And you hear the pain.
[1266.34 → 1267.78] David called for God
[1267.78 → 1268.56] to deliver him.
[1268.94 → 1269.44] He didn't
[1269.44 → 1271.88] want this.
[1275.54 → 1276.14] And yet,
[1276.30 → 1277.20] he ends the psalm
[1277.20 → 1278.12] in verse 8
[1278.12 → 1280.30] and come to the end.
[1280.30 → 1282.52] From the Lord
[1282.52 → 1283.62] comes deliverance.
[1283.76 → 1284.38] May blessings
[1284.38 → 1285.42] be on your people.
[1285.78 → 1286.52] Another translation
[1286.52 → 1287.54] says salvation
[1287.54 → 1289.08] belongs to the Lord.
[1289.92 → 1290.54] And for David,
[1290.82 → 1292.36] this was deliverance
[1292.36 → 1293.56] from his circumstances,
[1293.72 → 1294.38] his problems,
[1294.52 → 1294.98] his life.
[1295.06 → 1296.02] That's what he's after here.
[1296.50 → 1298.42] But notice he does include
[1298.42 → 1299.56] the people, right?
[1299.62 → 1300.36] Because he knows
[1300.36 → 1301.44] he's the leader
[1301.44 → 1302.22] of God's people.
[1302.62 → 1303.48] But in Christ,
[1303.78 → 1304.66] the son of David,
[1304.96 → 1306.02] salvation is about
[1306.02 → 1306.64] overcoming
[1306.64 → 1307.86] all sin
[1307.86 → 1309.62] and death itself.
[1311.16 → 1312.42] A much bigger
[1312.42 → 1313.22] restoration.
[1313.90 → 1314.50] And we await
[1314.50 → 1315.30] that restoration
[1315.30 → 1316.52] of all things
[1316.52 → 1317.40] when righteousness
[1317.40 → 1318.62] will finally prevail
[1318.62 → 1319.40] in all its fullness
[1319.40 → 1320.22] and evil
[1320.22 → 1321.00] will be vanquished
[1321.00 → 1321.40] forever.
[1322.44 → 1323.24] And we await
[1323.24 → 1323.70] the coming
[1323.70 → 1324.54] in all its,
[1324.94 → 1325.84] the kingdom coming
[1325.84 → 1326.70] in all its fullness.
[1327.42 → 1328.42] But in the meantime,
[1328.42 → 1329.30] we pray.
[1330.10 → 1331.30] And we pray in honesty.
[1331.64 → 1333.12] And we say raw things.
[1333.62 → 1336.48] Don't censor your prayers.
[1338.00 → 1339.38] Say what your heart
[1339.38 → 1340.66] or your gut
[1340.66 → 1341.58] is saying.
[1342.10 → 1343.10] God has big shoulders.
[1343.20 → 1343.86] He can take it.
[1347.90 → 1349.34] Don't hide that.
[1350.04 → 1350.86] And could we go to
[1350.86 → 1352.08] this God of power,
[1352.48 → 1353.84] this God who hears
[1353.84 → 1355.30] and can make
[1355.30 → 1356.26] the changes
[1356.26 → 1357.62] that we so much desire.
[1357.94 → 1358.72] Tim Keller wrote
[1358.72 → 1359.68] this about prayer.
[1361.58 → 1362.46] He wrote,
[1362.46 → 1363.72] we'll have a slide here.
[1364.16 → 1365.84] Prayer is the main way
[1365.84 → 1367.42] we experience
[1367.42 → 1368.58] deep change.
[1369.68 → 1370.62] The reordering
[1370.62 → 1371.38] of our lives.
[1371.42 → 1371.92] I like that.
[1372.00 → 1372.94] The reordering
[1372.94 → 1373.94] of our lives
[1373.94 → 1374.66] when we pray.
[1375.04 → 1375.74] Are you prepared
[1375.74 → 1376.34] to pray
[1376.34 → 1377.04] and then reorder
[1377.04 → 1377.62] your life?
[1378.98 → 1379.94] Prayer is how
[1379.94 → 1380.72] God gives us
[1380.72 → 1381.74] so many of the
[1381.74 → 1382.68] unimaginable things
[1382.68 → 1383.86] He has for us.
[1384.00 → 1384.74] He has for us.
[1385.10 → 1385.38] Indeed,
[1385.52 → 1386.06] prayer makes it
[1386.06 → 1386.64] safe for God
[1386.64 → 1387.10] to give us
[1387.10 → 1387.86] many of the things
[1387.86 → 1388.56] we most desire.
[1388.94 → 1389.58] Why is it safer?
[1389.86 → 1390.72] Because it's about
[1390.72 → 1391.58] God's power
[1391.58 → 1392.48] and not yours.
[1393.04 → 1394.56] We talk to the one
[1394.56 → 1395.44] who understands
[1395.44 → 1397.06] what justice looks like
[1397.06 → 1398.12] and has the power
[1398.12 → 1399.22] to bring justice about
[1399.22 → 1401.40] because we don't.
[1402.46 → 1403.68] We struggle with that,
[1403.76 → 1403.92] right?
[1404.00 → 1405.20] We wrestle with that.
[1405.38 → 1406.10] So we battle
[1406.10 → 1407.16] to understand justice.
[1407.32 → 1407.94] But God knows.
[1408.28 → 1408.88] Too often,
[1409.02 → 1409.84] we think we know
[1409.84 → 1411.14] exactly how everybody
[1411.14 → 1411.74] ought to think
[1411.74 → 1413.56] and that is a lie.
[1413.56 → 1418.44] C.S. Lewis writes this.
[1418.88 → 1419.62] Another quote here.
[1419.80 → 1420.60] It'll be up on the screen.
[1421.28 → 1422.08] You may be filled
[1422.08 → 1423.04] with self-pity.
[1423.94 → 1425.02] You may be filled
[1425.02 → 1426.42] with justifying resentment.
[1426.68 → 1427.42] You may be filled
[1427.42 → 1427.98] with anger
[1427.98 → 1429.04] towards someone.
[1430.36 → 1430.78] Then,
[1431.32 → 1432.06] so here's the response,
[1432.22 → 1432.92] sit down and pray.
[1434.00 → 1435.32] And get your heart
[1435.32 → 1436.44] reoriented
[1436.44 → 1438.00] in God's presence.
[1438.30 → 1439.14] And the pettiness
[1439.14 → 1440.12] of your feelings
[1440.12 → 1441.76] and your self-justifying
[1441.76 → 1442.36] excuses
[1442.36 → 1443.82] will go away.
[1444.90 → 1445.78] But notice where
[1445.78 → 1447.16] the change takes place.
[1448.28 → 1449.06] In you.
[1451.00 → 1452.04] So you pray
[1452.04 → 1453.32] and you bring it to God.
[1453.60 → 1454.58] It's so much easier
[1454.58 → 1455.40] to just react,
[1455.48 → 1455.76] isn't it?
[1456.06 → 1457.00] It's so much easier
[1457.00 → 1457.46] to go out
[1457.46 → 1458.28] and just try to break
[1458.28 → 1458.98] some teeth.
[1460.76 → 1461.62] Usually makes it
[1461.62 → 1462.12] way worse.
[1463.20 → 1464.32] Prayer is hard
[1464.32 → 1466.02] because it acknowledges
[1466.02 → 1467.18] God is the one
[1467.18 → 1468.48] who brings salvation
[1468.48 → 1469.32] and deliverance.
[1470.12 → 1471.60] God is the shield.
[1472.60 → 1474.20] God is the one
[1474.20 → 1475.24] who lifts our head.
[1475.66 → 1476.86] God is the one
[1476.86 → 1477.78] who saves.
[1478.20 → 1479.20] He answers.
[1479.94 → 1480.44] And sometimes,
[1480.54 → 1480.64] yeah,
[1480.68 → 1481.70] in ways I don't comprehend.
[1484.66 → 1486.06] And when I focus on him
[1486.06 → 1486.44] and I love,
[1486.64 → 1487.98] I put Hebrews 12 down,
[1488.16 → 1488.92] this idea of focus,
[1489.00 → 1489.60] look at it with me,
[1490.36 → 1491.88] where the writer writes,
[1491.94 → 1492.64] and let us run
[1492.64 → 1493.28] with perseverance
[1493.28 → 1494.22] and race marked out
[1494.22 → 1494.52] for us,
[1494.60 → 1495.34] run our lives.
[1495.72 → 1496.14] And then this,
[1496.24 → 1497.18] fixing our eyes
[1497.18 → 1497.62] on Jesus,
[1497.82 → 1498.32] the pioneer
[1498.32 → 1498.98] and perfecter
[1498.98 → 1499.44] of faith.
[1499.92 → 1500.04] You know,
[1500.10 → 1502.44] I take the focus,
[1502.98 → 1504.20] I take the focus
[1504.20 → 1505.38] off the issues,
[1505.64 → 1506.58] off the problem,
[1506.88 → 1507.70] off the enemy,
[1507.86 → 1508.92] and I put it
[1508.92 → 1509.68] on Jesus,
[1510.02 → 1510.64] the perfecter
[1510.64 → 1511.18] of my faith,
[1511.24 → 1511.84] the one who leads
[1511.84 → 1512.32] me forward.
[1512.90 → 1513.60] And then I allow
[1513.60 → 1514.52] God to be God,
[1514.60 → 1516.00] and then I can rest
[1516.00 → 1516.48] in him,
[1516.60 → 1517.80] and I can take steps
[1517.80 → 1518.68] because I'm focused
[1518.68 → 1519.20] on him,
[1519.20 → 1520.32] and I follow him
[1520.32 → 1521.20] in his ways.
[1521.20 → 1521.78] ways.
[1527.16 → 1528.06] We're going to have
[1528.06 → 1528.48] communion,
[1529.48 → 1531.64] and I invite
[1531.64 → 1532.98] all of you
[1532.98 → 1534.74] who long
[1534.74 → 1535.66] to lay
[1535.66 → 1536.82] your lives
[1536.82 → 1538.56] fully before
[1538.56 → 1539.14] the Lord
[1539.14 → 1541.46] to partake.
[1541.46 → 1547.72] we take
[1547.72 → 1548.22] Jesus
[1548.22 → 1549.26] in
[1549.26 → 1550.94] his body
[1550.94 → 1551.68] and blood.
[1552.48 → 1552.96] We fix
[1552.96 → 1553.66] our eyes
[1553.66 → 1554.84] on him
[1554.84 → 1556.62] so he
[1556.62 → 1558.08] can change
[1558.08 → 1558.46] us.
[1559.90 → 1560.38] So all
[1560.38 → 1561.00] who want to come,
[1561.08 → 1561.76] I welcome you
[1561.76 → 1562.62] to the Lord's table.
[1563.56 → 1564.16] And I was thinking
[1564.16 → 1564.44] about that,
[1564.46 → 1565.68] who sits at the table?
[1565.92 → 1566.48] Who's sitting
[1566.48 → 1566.92] at the table
[1566.92 → 1567.34] with Jesus?
[1568.08 → 1568.30] Well,
[1568.32 → 1568.66] it's a bunch
[1568.66 → 1569.20] of his friends
[1569.20 → 1570.44] who would soon
[1570.44 → 1571.20] abandon him
[1571.20 → 1571.60] in his hour
[1571.60 → 1572.44] of greatest needs.
[1572.88 → 1573.90] One would deny him
[1573.90 → 1575.42] that he even knew him
[1575.42 → 1576.02] three times.
[1576.42 → 1577.58] One betrayed him
[1577.58 → 1578.62] to Jesus' enemies.
[1579.82 → 1580.92] And they're all
[1580.92 → 1581.76] at the table.
[1583.50 → 1584.34] They're all
[1584.34 → 1585.56] at the table.
[1587.22 → 1588.36] Let me ask you this.
[1590.10 → 1591.14] Are you willing
[1591.14 → 1592.20] to share the meal
[1592.20 → 1592.98] with those
[1592.98 → 1593.60] who you might
[1593.60 → 1594.16] consider
[1594.16 → 1595.36] your enemies?
[1599.20 → 1604.22] someone who has
[1604.22 → 1604.78] hurt you?
[1606.28 → 1606.92] Someone who's
[1606.92 → 1607.84] disappointed you?
[1609.24 → 1609.74] Maybe someone
[1609.74 → 1610.98] who even betrayed you?
[1612.06 → 1612.82] Maybe even
[1612.82 → 1613.60] denied you?
[1619.78 → 1620.46] I'm going to read
[1620.46 → 1621.10] you a story
[1621.10 → 1624.00] out of this book
[1624.00 → 1624.86] that I'm reading
[1624.86 → 1626.26] from Philip Yancey.
[1626.26 → 1627.44] But he quotes
[1627.44 → 1629.40] Miroslaw Golf,
[1630.42 → 1631.88] a great thinker.
[1633.38 → 1634.18] And Miroslaw Golf
[1634.18 → 1635.42] is telling the story
[1635.42 → 1637.32] about a man
[1637.32 → 1638.58] named
[1638.58 → 1641.22] Father Markovic.
[1642.36 → 1643.04] This is during
[1643.04 → 1643.86] the 92,
[1644.30 → 1645.38] during the Sarajevo
[1645.38 → 1646.10] with the war
[1646.10 → 1646.82] in Bosnia.
[1647.18 → 1648.22] And it was a terrible,
[1648.36 → 1648.80] terrible war,
[1648.84 → 1649.82] like all wars are.
[1651.44 → 1652.26] There are lots of battles
[1652.26 → 1653.72] between Muslims
[1653.72 → 1655.12] and Christians.
[1655.12 → 1655.48] I mean,
[1655.52 → 1656.00] it was this,
[1656.70 → 1657.50] lots of killing
[1657.50 → 1658.22] on both sides.
[1660.00 → 1660.96] Father Markovic,
[1661.38 → 1662.46] his village
[1662.46 → 1663.22] had been taken
[1663.22 → 1665.08] over by the Muslims
[1665.08 → 1667.12] and nine
[1667.12 → 1668.16] of his family
[1668.16 → 1670.28] were killed
[1670.28 → 1671.94] in the attack.
[1673.30 → 1674.54] And then this little story.
[1678.12 → 1679.32] Occupying the house
[1679.32 → 1680.36] in which his brother
[1680.36 → 1681.16] used to live
[1681.16 → 1681.88] was a fierce
[1681.88 → 1683.18] Muslim woman.
[1683.18 → 1685.02] Markovic
[1685.02 → 1686.28] was warned
[1686.28 → 1686.90] not to go
[1686.90 → 1687.40] to that house
[1687.40 → 1687.88] because she
[1687.88 → 1688.78] brandished a rifle
[1688.78 → 1689.56] to protect
[1689.56 → 1690.60] her new home.
[1691.18 → 1691.98] But he went anyway.
[1692.80 → 1693.76] As he approached
[1693.76 → 1694.42] the house,
[1695.58 → 1696.36] she was waiting
[1696.36 → 1696.76] for him,
[1696.86 → 1697.78] cigarette in her mouth,
[1697.96 → 1698.74] rifle cocked.
[1699.54 → 1700.46] And she barked,
[1700.50 → 1700.92] go away
[1700.92 → 1701.54] or I'll shoot.
[1702.92 → 1703.32] No,
[1703.38 → 1704.16] you won't shoot me,
[1704.28 → 1706.08] said Father Markovic
[1706.08 → 1706.66] in a gentle
[1706.66 → 1707.46] but firm voice.
[1707.46 → 1708.92] You'll make
[1708.92 → 1709.72] a cup of coffee
[1709.72 → 1710.16] for me.
[1712.68 → 1713.50] She stared
[1713.50 → 1713.78] at him
[1713.78 → 1714.34] for a while
[1714.34 → 1716.38] and then slowly
[1716.38 → 1717.54] put the rifle down
[1717.54 → 1718.72] and went
[1718.72 → 1719.32] to the kitchen.
[1720.54 → 1721.40] Taking the last
[1721.40 → 1722.00] bit of coffee
[1722.00 → 1722.54] she had,
[1722.60 → 1723.16] she mixed it
[1723.16 → 1723.92] with some grounds
[1723.92 → 1724.68] already used
[1724.68 → 1725.70] to make enough
[1725.70 → 1727.02] coffee for two cups.
[1728.02 → 1728.58] And they,
[1729.04 → 1730.06] deadly enemies,
[1730.22 → 1731.14] began to talk
[1731.14 → 1732.40] as they partook
[1732.40 → 1733.64] in the ancient
[1733.64 → 1735.24] ritual of hospitality,
[1735.24 → 1737.14] drinking coffee
[1737.14 → 1737.70] together.
[1738.90 → 1739.70] She told him
[1739.70 → 1740.78] of her loneliness,
[1741.74 → 1742.72] of the home
[1742.72 → 1743.98] she had lost,
[1744.32 → 1744.98] of the son
[1744.98 → 1745.98] who never returned
[1745.98 → 1746.86] from the battlefield.
[1748.00 → 1749.36] And when Father Markovic
[1749.36 → 1750.54] returned a month later
[1750.54 → 1751.30] she told him,
[1751.62 → 1752.26] I rejoice
[1752.26 → 1753.14] at seeing you
[1753.14 → 1753.98] as much as if
[1753.98 → 1754.86] my son had
[1754.86 → 1755.82] returned home.
[1758.82 → 1759.76] Did they talk
[1759.76 → 1760.36] about forgiveness?
[1761.98 → 1762.54] I don't know.
[1763.38 → 1763.98] And in a sense
[1763.98 → 1764.64] it doesn't matter.
[1765.24 → 1765.96] He,
[1766.34 → 1766.88] the victim,
[1767.04 → 1768.32] came to her
[1768.32 → 1769.26] asking for her
[1769.26 → 1769.92] hospitality
[1769.92 → 1771.32] in his brother's
[1771.32 → 1771.68] home,
[1772.04 → 1772.50] which she
[1772.50 → 1773.18] unrightfully
[1773.18 → 1773.72] possessed.
[1774.76 → 1775.22] And she
[1775.22 → 1775.80] responded.
[1777.26 → 1777.72] Though she
[1777.72 → 1778.26] greeted him
[1778.26 → 1778.84] with a rifle
[1778.84 → 1779.64] she gave him
[1779.64 → 1780.06] a gift
[1780.06 → 1780.56] and came
[1780.56 → 1781.26] to rejoice
[1781.26 → 1782.64] with his
[1782.64 → 1783.12] presence.
[1783.74 → 1784.12] And the
[1784.12 → 1784.50] humble,
[1784.74 → 1785.12] tenuous
[1785.12 → 1785.64] beginnings
[1785.64 → 1786.36] of a journey
[1786.36 → 1787.52] toward embrace
[1787.52 → 1788.18] was enacted
[1788.18 → 1788.68] through the
[1788.68 → 1789.10] ritual
[1789.10 → 1790.08] of coffee
[1790.08 → 1790.48] drinking.
[1791.62 → 1792.08] If the
[1792.08 → 1792.96] journey continues
[1792.96 → 1793.70] it will lead
[1793.70 → 1794.08] through the
[1794.08 → 1794.98] difficult terrain
[1794.98 → 1796.78] of forgiveness.
[1799.56 → 1800.32] The
[1800.32 → 1801.48] difficult terrain
[1801.48 → 1802.56] of forgiveness.
[1804.20 → 1805.00] The terrain
[1805.00 → 1807.30] that Jesus
[1807.30 → 1810.36] travelled.
[1811.76 → 1812.62] The terrain
[1812.62 → 1813.42] that he
[1813.42 → 1814.14] walked the
[1814.14 → 1815.10] road to the
[1815.10 → 1815.52] cross.
[1816.96 → 1818.18] So that you
[1818.18 → 1818.68] and I
[1818.68 → 1819.92] could be
[1819.92 → 1820.22] forgiven.
[1820.22 → 1823.56] I invite
[1823.56 → 1824.20] you to
[1824.20 → 1824.80] come sit
[1824.80 → 1825.08] at the
[1825.08 → 1825.44] table.
[1828.82 → 1829.36] Yeah,
[1829.44 → 1829.78] with some
[1829.78 → 1830.38] enemies maybe.
[1831.46 → 1832.10] Maybe especially
[1832.10 → 1832.46] with some
[1832.46 → 1832.74] enemies.
[1835.92 → 1836.92] God sets
[1836.92 → 1837.46] the table
[1837.46 → 1838.20] in the midst
[1838.20 → 1838.92] of our enemies
[1838.92 → 1839.72] so we can be
[1839.72 → 1840.30] nourished.
[1840.50 → 1840.98] That's what the
[1840.98 → 1841.66] psalmist said.
[1842.80 → 1843.30] Nourished
[1843.30 → 1844.08] by Jesus.
[1844.08 → 1846.66] the one
[1846.66 → 1850.08] who took
[1850.08 → 1850.68] the bread
[1850.68 → 1852.28] and said
[1852.28 → 1852.92] my body
[1852.92 → 1855.12] is for you
[1855.12 → 1856.42] to bring you
[1856.42 → 1857.10] wholeness
[1857.10 → 1858.34] and life.
[1858.86 → 1859.70] I give you
[1859.70 → 1860.50] myself.
[1861.94 → 1862.70] The one
[1862.70 → 1863.22] who said
[1863.22 → 1865.06] this is my
[1865.06 → 1865.44] blood
[1865.44 → 1866.40] and it shed
[1866.40 → 1868.04] it shed
[1868.04 → 1868.84] for you
[1868.84 → 1870.14] to cleanse
[1870.14 → 1870.38] you,
[1870.64 → 1871.36] to change
[1871.36 → 1871.94] you from
[1871.94 → 1873.04] being enemies
[1873.04 → 1873.68] of God,
[1874.04 → 1874.80] to being sons
[1874.80 → 1875.44] and daughters
[1875.44 → 1875.88] of the
[1875.88 → 1876.76] Most High.
[1879.90 → 1880.60] Think about
[1880.60 → 1880.92] that.
[1885.80 → 1886.56] I invite
[1886.56 → 1887.12] you to go
[1887.12 → 1887.50] to one of
[1887.50 → 1888.04] the four
[1888.04 → 1888.46] tables
[1888.46 → 1890.62] and to
[1890.62 → 1891.22] receive
[1891.22 → 1892.84] the body
[1892.84 → 1893.12] and the
[1893.12 → 1893.40] blood
[1893.40 → 1895.88] and to
[1895.88 → 1896.42] eat and
[1896.42 → 1896.74] to drink.
[1896.82 → 1897.00] You can
[1897.00 → 1897.44] take it to
[1897.44 → 1897.92] your seats
[1897.92 → 1898.70] and eat
[1898.70 → 1899.34] and drink
[1899.34 → 1901.54] and remember
[1901.54 → 1903.08] that you
[1903.08 → 1903.56] are sons
[1903.56 → 1904.10] and daughters
[1904.10 → 1904.48] of the
[1904.48 → 1905.06] Most High
[1905.06 → 1906.78] because of
[1906.78 → 1907.22] what Jesus
[1907.22 → 1907.74] has done.
[1908.80 → 1909.22] And in
[1909.22 → 1909.54] turn,
[1909.78 → 1910.46] you get to
[1910.46 → 1911.04] bless others.
[1912.00 → 1912.60] I invite you
[1912.60 → 1912.88] to come.
[1912.88 → 1912.96] Amen.
[1926.30 → 1927.56] Before you
[1927.56 → 1928.08] go any
[1928.08 → 1928.32] further,
[1928.32 → 1929.28] I want
[1929.28 → 1929.68] to say
[1929.68 → 1932.40] when you
[1932.40 → 1933.38] eat the
[1933.38 → 1933.76] bread and
[1933.76 → 1934.44] drink the
[1934.44 → 1934.62] blood,
[1934.78 → 1935.04] remember
[1935.04 → 1936.52] that Christ
[1936.52 → 1936.86] says,
[1937.02 → 1937.32] take,
[1938.14 → 1938.50] eat,
[1939.00 → 1939.30] remember
[1939.30 → 1939.92] and believe
[1939.92 → 1940.72] that I
[1940.72 → 1941.26] have died
[1941.26 → 1941.78] and rose
[1941.78 → 1942.52] again for
[1942.52 → 1942.72] you.
[1942.72 → 1942.78] Amen.
[1958.32 → 1962.66] good
[1965.54 → 1967.88] up
[1967.88 → 1968.86] on
[1968.86 → 1969.70] going
[1969.76 → 1970.54] on
[1970.54 → 1971.56] on
[1971.56 → 1975.54].
[1975.78 → 1976.64] on
[1976.64 → 2006.62] Thank you.
[2006.64 → 2036.62] Thank you.
[2036.64 → 2066.62] Thank you.
[2066.64 → 2096.62] Thank you.
[2096.64 → 2126.62] Thank you.
[2126.64 → 2156.62] Thank you.
[2156.64 → 2186.62] Thank you.
[2186.64 → 2216.62] Thank you.
[2216.64 → 2246.62] Thank you.
[2246.64 → 2276.62] Thank you.
[2276.64 → 2306.62] Thank you.
[2306.64 → 2336.62] Thank you.
[2336.62 → 2366.60] Thank you.
[2366.62 → 2396.58] Thank you.
[2396.58 → 2398.58] Thank you.
