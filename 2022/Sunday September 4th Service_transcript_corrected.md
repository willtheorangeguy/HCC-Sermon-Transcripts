[0.00 → 5.76] Good morning.
[8.48 → 12.76] It's my privilege to be with you again this morning
[12.76 → 19.68] as we enter into this new season of school
[19.68 → 21.92] and sort of back to normal.
[22.20 → 23.30] I hope you had a great summer.
[23.44 → 24.46] I hope you enjoyed yourselves
[24.46 → 28.30] and were able to find some time to relax and get away.
[28.62 → 29.48] That's a blessing.
[29.48 → 31.92] But a real blessing on all you who are,
[32.38 → 35.50] particularly students who are heading out again and back at it.
[35.62 → 36.62] So blessings to you.
[37.92 → 41.48] We're also coming to the end of our summer series on the Psalms.
[43.14 → 45.38] It was entitled Honest Prayers.
[46.62 → 50.76] We wanted you to see that, and as Brad also said,
[51.06 → 55.54] that all this range of emotions that are in the Psalms
[55.54 → 59.26] are an expression of how we can pray.
[59.26 → 61.72] Sometimes we think we have to make our prayers pretty,
[61.72 → 64.80] and some of the Psalms aren't particularly pretty.
[65.84 → 69.72] And it's good for us to know that we can be honest with God
[69.72 → 72.44] and say whatever's on our hearts,
[72.48 → 75.26] even if it's not appropriate to say what's on our hearts.
[75.34 → 76.78] Sometimes we can say those things,
[77.32 → 79.78] and God will hear us anyway.
[79.78 → 84.06] So I'm going to get into the last Psalm that we're going to be dealing with,
[84.24 → 86.20] and it's Psalm, as you've probably gathered right now,
[86.28 → 87.46] Psalm 139.
[87.60 → 88.72] So let's read it together.
[88.72 → 93.26] You have searched me, Lord,
[93.26 → 96.14] and you know me.
[97.68 → 100.08] You perceive my thoughts from afar.
[100.24 → 102.80] You discern my going out and my lying down.
[102.90 → 106.20] You're familiar with all my ways.
[106.20 → 109.48] Before a word is on my tongue,
[110.08 → 111.84] you, Lord, know it completely.
[112.34 → 113.54] You hem me in behind,
[113.70 → 115.58] and before you lay your hand upon me,
[116.28 → 117.82] such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
[117.90 → 120.04] too lofty for me to attain.
[121.54 → 123.38] Where can I go from your spirit?
[123.72 → 126.06] Where can I flee from your presence?
[126.06 → 129.38] If I go up to the heavens, you're there.
[129.64 → 131.54] If I make my bed in the depths, you're there.
[131.64 → 133.08] If I rise on the wings of the dawn,
[133.14 → 134.76] if I settle on the far side of the sea,
[135.18 → 136.96] even there your hand will guide me,
[137.02 → 138.94] your right hand will hold me fast.
[140.24 → 142.34] If I say, surely the darkness will hide me,
[142.36 → 143.72] and the light will become night around me,
[143.92 → 146.02] even the darkness will not be dark to you.
[146.10 → 147.68] The night will shine like the day,
[147.74 → 150.52] for the darkness is as light to you.
[151.98 → 154.94] You created my inmost being.
[154.94 → 157.86] You knit me together in my mother's womb.
[158.24 → 160.20] I praise you because I am fearfully
[160.20 → 161.42] and wonderfully made.
[161.80 → 163.56] Your works are wonderful.
[163.68 → 164.82] I know that full well.
[165.92 → 167.50] My frame was not hidden from you
[167.50 → 169.10] when I was made in the secret place,
[169.24 → 170.52] when I was woven together
[170.52 → 171.88] in the depths of the earth.
[173.02 → 174.68] Your eyes saw my unformed body.
[174.76 → 176.20] All the days ordained for me
[176.20 → 177.18] were written in your book
[177.18 → 179.02] before one of them came to be.
[180.28 → 182.74] How precious to me are your thoughts, God.
[182.74 → 185.50] How vast the sum of them.
[186.46 → 187.32] Were I to count them,
[187.38 → 189.06] they would outnumber the grains of sand.
[189.60 → 192.08] When I am awake, I am still with you.
[193.32 → 195.58] If only you, God, would slay the wicked.
[195.70 → 197.22] Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty.
[197.34 → 198.82] They speak of you with evil intent.
[199.14 → 200.82] Your adversaries misuse your name.
[201.16 → 202.90] Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord,
[203.00 → 205.50] and abhor those who are in rebellion against you?
[205.50 → 208.12] I have nothing but hatred for them.
[208.80 → 210.02] I count them my enemies.
[212.72 → 213.84] Search me, God.
[213.92 → 214.56] Know my heart.
[215.76 → 218.22] Test me and know my anxious thoughts.
[219.02 → 221.18] See if there's any offensive way in me
[221.18 → 223.48] and lead me in the way everlasting.
[226.50 → 227.40] There's a lot there.
[227.40 → 231.08] The psalmist is praising God
[231.08 → 234.54] for the amazing creation that we are.
[235.86 → 236.62] That we are.
[236.94 → 238.42] You knit me together.
[238.60 → 239.98] You wash me even in the womb.
[240.54 → 242.56] You know, we should be so thankful
[242.56 → 244.86] for the gift of our bodies.
[245.10 → 245.84] I'm going to start there.
[247.10 → 248.78] But I think like a lot of people,
[248.88 → 251.02] we tend to see and experience our flaws
[251.02 → 252.52] and imperfections even more
[252.52 → 254.40] than the gloriousness of our bodies.
[254.82 → 256.04] We either think we're too short,
[256.04 → 257.96] too tall, too heavy, too weak, too whatever.
[258.50 → 261.40] And often we don't appreciate our bodies
[261.40 → 264.74] and our health until we get unhealthy.
[266.30 → 269.12] I, for example, really appreciate balance.
[269.76 → 272.46] I spent the last year struggling with vertigo
[272.46 → 275.20] and suddenly balance or the lack thereof
[275.20 → 275.74] is a thing.
[276.38 → 278.08] And I'm really grateful to balance.
[278.18 → 279.42] So when you get home today,
[279.86 → 281.50] thank God for your balance.
[281.70 → 282.96] Because I never did
[282.96 → 284.96] until it was sort of compromised.
[286.04 → 287.78] And I think that's kind of how we go
[287.78 → 288.50] through our lives.
[288.96 → 291.10] We're finally aware of something
[291.10 → 293.56] when it's sort of not there
[293.56 → 294.62] in the same way.
[295.46 → 296.52] We need to be,
[296.60 → 297.38] and the psalmist does that,
[297.42 → 298.56] need to be reminded of the gift
[298.56 → 299.30] of our bodies.
[300.46 → 302.46] We are image bearers of God,
[302.60 → 303.66] woven together by God,
[303.78 → 305.58] fearfully and wonderfully made.
[305.58 → 308.00] I mean, this is the psalm of thanksgiving,
[308.50 → 309.96] the gift of health in our bodies.
[310.28 → 311.62] God's creative goodness
[311.62 → 314.18] is celebrated in this psalm.
[315.58 → 316.16] In this psalm,
[316.26 → 317.68] the sacredness of life
[317.68 → 319.44] is affirmed even in the womb.
[320.74 → 322.28] Life is sacred.
[323.18 → 324.58] And the singer acknowledges
[324.58 → 327.36] all life is in God's hands.
[328.06 → 330.80] His eyes even held are unformed being.
[331.32 → 331.76] So yes,
[332.04 → 334.56] the body matters deeply.
[336.46 → 337.38] I just want you to think
[337.38 → 338.10] on that a little bit.
[338.52 → 339.44] There can be a tendency
[339.44 → 340.44] in Christianity
[340.44 → 341.60] to separate the body
[341.60 → 342.40] from the spiritual.
[342.96 → 344.34] And then the spiritual life
[344.34 → 345.18] can seem like
[345.18 → 346.92] an endless futile attempt
[346.92 → 348.32] to overcome the fact
[348.32 → 349.36] that we have bodies
[349.36 → 350.02] with urges
[350.02 → 351.22] and all kinds of other things.
[351.44 → 352.12] And then the body
[352.12 → 353.28] is just a big problem
[353.28 → 354.16] to the spiritual.
[354.96 → 355.92] And the psalmist is saying,
[356.00 → 356.72] no, no, no, no,
[356.76 → 357.42] wait a minute here.
[357.80 → 358.44] Yeah, there's going to be
[358.44 → 359.14] some struggle with that,
[359.14 → 360.32] but your body is a gift.
[360.74 → 361.44] Your body is a gift.
[361.92 → 362.36] And then,
[362.70 → 363.48] otherwise we can,
[363.58 → 364.22] we chase our,
[364.32 → 365.18] spend our whole lives
[365.18 → 366.10] somehow thinking
[366.10 → 367.10] the body is the enemy.
[367.52 → 368.26] And it's not.
[370.74 → 372.30] Body and spirit.
[373.58 → 373.76] Right?
[373.86 → 375.02] We are whole beings.
[375.18 → 376.34] And things like worship
[376.34 → 378.00] and prayer and service,
[378.36 → 379.96] practices that put our body
[379.96 → 380.96] and our spirit
[380.96 → 382.60] on the same page.
[383.00 → 383.88] Those are important.
[384.00 → 385.46] That's why we gather together
[385.46 → 386.10] physically,
[386.46 → 387.86] because we need that.
[387.86 → 388.90] And this God
[388.90 → 390.10] who wonderfully creates,
[390.50 → 392.38] He knows us
[392.38 → 394.16] and is with us
[394.16 → 395.02] always.
[397.66 → 398.36] And you say,
[398.54 → 399.96] well, isn't that comforting?
[401.24 → 402.06] And it is.
[403.12 → 403.86] And you say,
[403.94 → 404.96] well, isn't that
[404.96 → 405.90] discomforting?
[407.04 → 407.96] And it is.
[410.02 → 411.30] It is to some degree,
[411.38 → 411.68] isn't it?
[412.10 → 412.34] You know,
[412.66 → 414.50] the psalmist is basically saying
[414.50 → 416.38] that God is saying to us,
[416.38 → 417.58] I know where you live.
[419.20 → 419.96] Now, that can be
[419.96 → 421.04] a wonderful thing, right?
[421.06 → 422.10] We can hear that phrase,
[422.26 → 423.30] I know where you live,
[423.44 → 423.84] and say,
[423.88 → 424.56] oh, isn't that wonderful?
[424.62 → 425.52] That guy knows where I live.
[425.56 → 426.32] Isn't that a beautiful thing?
[426.48 → 426.86] Or I say,
[426.92 → 427.88] I know where you live.
[429.42 → 430.56] That's a whole different
[430.56 → 431.40] feel to it.
[431.66 → 432.34] And sometimes,
[432.42 → 433.40] I've heard God,
[433.58 → 435.40] in my own experience,
[435.84 → 437.44] God knows exactly where I am.
[437.52 → 438.42] Oh, what a wonderful leaf.
[438.72 → 439.22] Oh, no,
[439.32 → 440.68] God knows exactly where I am.
[440.68 → 441.34] What a horrible thing.
[441.34 → 444.00] Because I don't always
[444.00 → 444.78] want to be found.
[447.02 → 448.44] There's no place
[448.44 → 449.74] to hide.
[451.16 → 451.76] And this God
[451.76 → 452.82] searches me,
[452.92 → 453.76] and he searches me
[453.76 → 455.70] inside and out.
[456.74 → 458.18] And this God says,
[458.44 → 459.54] or the scripture says,
[460.04 → 461.38] I'm hemmed in.
[461.78 → 462.68] How does that sound to you?
[462.98 → 464.20] I'm hemmed in.
[465.38 → 466.80] I'm claustrophobic.
[466.80 → 469.86] I don't like this thought
[469.86 → 471.04] of being hemmed in.
[471.92 → 472.46] Is God,
[472.62 → 473.94] can I get out?
[474.88 → 476.56] So this idea of being hemmed in,
[476.64 → 477.68] I'm going to talk a little bit
[477.68 → 478.18] more about that.
[478.40 → 479.54] But some of this language,
[480.02 → 480.56] the psalmist,
[480.68 → 481.26] you can feel,
[481.60 → 482.82] he has mixed feelings.
[483.34 → 484.32] Wonderful, awesome,
[484.44 → 485.36] beautiful, my body,
[485.46 → 486.40] yes, wonderful God,
[486.60 → 487.32] with me always.
[488.02 → 489.08] And you don't want to hide.
[490.82 → 491.86] I don't want God
[491.86 → 492.66] to know everything about me.
[492.90 → 494.56] Some of us struggle deeply
[494.56 → 496.90] with being known.
[499.42 → 499.86] Known.
[501.14 → 501.98] Show of hands,
[502.06 → 502.94] how many of you would like
[502.94 → 504.06] every thought you ever had
[504.06 → 505.16] displayed on the screen?
[507.18 → 508.04] Any takers?
[509.10 → 509.96] No, I don't want to be
[509.96 → 511.04] that known either.
[511.76 → 512.96] Nor maybe should we be,
[513.10 → 513.26] because,
[513.64 → 514.42] but we all know
[514.42 → 515.16] we have thoughts
[515.16 → 517.16] and sometimes experiences
[517.16 → 518.56] that we would not want
[518.56 → 519.64] to be shared
[519.64 → 520.38] and would not want
[520.38 → 521.14] everyone to know about.
[521.64 → 523.46] Some of us go to great lengths
[523.46 → 525.98] not to be deeply known.
[527.28 → 528.70] Keep everything here.
[529.72 → 530.40] Everything here.
[531.14 → 531.84] Don't let anything,
[532.10 → 533.22] don't get too fully known.
[533.52 → 534.30] And then the psalmist says,
[534.36 → 535.46] where can I go from your spirit?
[535.52 → 536.48] Where can I flee
[536.48 → 537.52] from your presence?
[538.02 → 540.38] Because sometimes I want to.
[543.32 → 544.40] Sometimes I want to.
[544.40 → 549.80] One writer said this.
[550.68 → 550.90] He said,
[550.98 → 552.16] being so close to God
[552.16 → 553.40] is as burdensome
[553.40 → 554.36] as it is beautiful.
[556.56 → 556.94] Hmm.
[558.50 → 559.82] I don't know if you relate to that.
[560.80 → 561.98] I was thinking of Jonah
[561.98 → 563.02] as an example.
[563.80 → 563.98] Right.
[564.34 → 565.64] God tells Jonah
[565.64 → 566.10] to go
[566.10 → 567.52] to the enemies
[567.52 → 568.58] and to tell,
[568.74 → 569.52] to try to get them
[569.52 → 570.02] to repent
[570.02 → 570.48] so that
[570.48 → 571.38] they can
[571.38 → 572.12] be forgiven
[572.12 → 573.44] and have a relationship
[573.44 → 573.94] with God
[573.94 → 575.08] and Jonah does not
[575.08 → 575.98] want to do that at all.
[576.16 → 576.58] He wants
[576.58 → 578.58] those enemies killed.
[579.26 → 580.32] Those enemies destroyed.
[580.42 → 581.16] They're enemies of Israel.
[581.78 → 582.72] And so he runs
[582.72 → 584.30] trying to hide from God
[584.30 → 586.32] and a God
[586.32 → 587.26] who seems to care
[587.26 → 587.86] about his enemies
[587.86 → 588.76] more than Jonah
[588.76 → 589.44] certainly does.
[589.90 → 590.90] And it doesn't work.
[590.98 → 591.82] You can read the story
[591.82 → 592.48] of Jonah, right?
[592.52 → 593.94] He ends up having to go
[593.94 → 595.70] and tell his enemies
[595.70 → 597.56] that there is a God
[597.56 → 598.14] and this God
[598.14 → 598.86] wants him to repent
[598.86 → 599.50] because this God
[599.50 → 600.44] cares for them.
[600.44 → 604.84] Jonah tries hiding
[604.84 → 605.96] and it doesn't work.
[608.12 → 609.42] In John 1 49
[609.42 → 611.10] I was reading this
[611.10 → 612.36] this is when Jesus
[612.36 → 613.22] is looking for disciples
[613.22 → 615.26] and he comes across
[615.26 → 616.34] a guy named Nathaniel
[616.34 → 619.40] and Jesus comes to him
[619.40 → 620.36] and Nathaniel starts
[620.36 → 620.72] with this.
[620.98 → 622.74] How do you know me?
[624.22 → 625.10] There's that word.
[625.24 → 627.16] How do you know me?
[628.08 → 628.98] Nathaniel asked
[628.98 → 630.28] and Jesus answered
[630.28 → 631.04] I saw you
[631.04 → 631.58] and this is
[631.58 → 632.36] there's something
[632.36 → 632.98] miraculous here.
[633.22 → 633.72] I saw you
[633.72 → 634.20] while you're still
[634.20 → 634.90] under the fig tree
[634.90 → 636.22] before Philip called you.
[636.56 → 637.20] I've been seeing you
[637.20 → 637.84] for a long time.
[638.20 → 639.04] Then Nathaniel declared
[639.04 → 640.40] Rabbi you are the son of God
[640.40 → 641.58] you are the king of Israel.
[641.82 → 641.90] Right?
[642.08 → 643.30] He has this reaction
[643.30 → 645.02] this God knows me
[645.02 → 646.00] and he knows me
[646.00 → 648.00] in ways that he shouldn't
[648.00 → 649.60] in a human sense
[649.60 → 650.62] and somehow
[650.62 → 651.66] this reveals
[651.66 → 652.84] that he is God.
[652.84 → 657.36] 1 Corinthians 6
[657.36 → 658.80] verse 19 through 20
[658.80 → 660.90] I put 16 on my outline
[660.90 → 661.48] hopefully we get
[661.48 → 662.26] the right verse up here.
[662.70 → 663.14] Yeah we do.
[664.18 → 665.00] Do you know that
[665.00 → 665.74] your bodies
[665.74 → 667.08] and here's this note again
[667.08 → 668.54] do you know that
[668.54 → 669.20] your bodies
[669.20 → 669.86] are the temple
[669.86 → 670.68] of the Holy Spirit
[670.68 → 672.36] who is in you?
[674.86 → 675.66] Think about it
[675.66 → 677.46] who is in you
[677.46 → 680.88] whom you have received
[680.88 → 681.32] from God.
[681.44 → 682.66] You are not
[682.66 → 683.88] your own.
[685.34 → 686.02] You were bought
[686.02 → 686.76] at a price
[686.76 → 687.92] therefore honour God
[687.92 → 689.72] with your bodies.
[691.80 → 693.24] Know that God
[693.24 → 694.16] so deeply
[694.16 → 695.10] the God who is
[695.10 → 696.38] in you.
[697.82 → 699.50] Let that sink in.
[702.90 → 704.80] He knows you.
[705.52 → 706.76] God is so close.
[706.86 → 707.56] He knows me.
[707.62 → 708.40] He cares about me.
[708.52 → 709.00] He forms me.
[709.04 → 709.64] He seeks me.
[709.70 → 710.42] He knows my heart.
[710.42 → 711.42] He knows my thoughts.
[711.54 → 713.20] He knows my every day
[713.20 → 713.94] that I have.
[714.04 → 715.22] He promises me eternity.
[715.70 → 716.66] The psalmist refers
[716.66 → 717.38] to himself
[717.38 → 718.24] in this psalm
[718.24 → 719.84] 13 times.
[720.18 → 720.66] Search me.
[720.74 → 721.06] Know me.
[721.12 → 721.50] My thoughts.
[721.60 → 722.06] My path.
[722.96 → 723.66] He knows.
[723.74 → 724.72] The Hebrew word is Ada.
[726.08 → 727.06] Ada Ada Ada.
[727.36 → 728.42] No, no no I guess.
[729.20 → 730.02] Seven times.
[730.34 → 731.22] A rich word
[731.22 → 732.80] in the Hebrew language
[732.80 → 734.96] with a whole range
[734.96 → 735.54] of meanings.
[735.94 → 736.60] It can go from
[736.60 → 737.42] simple recognition
[737.98 → 738.50] of someone.
[738.68 → 739.24] Oh I know you.
[739.24 → 740.76] A simple recognition
[740.76 → 741.84] to the intimacy
[741.84 → 742.98] of a sexual relationship.
[744.30 → 745.04] Like it says
[745.04 → 745.94] in Genesis 4
[745.94 → 747.98] Adam knew
[747.98 → 749.52] his wife Eve
[749.52 → 750.94] and it's referring
[750.94 → 751.80] to the sexual
[751.80 → 752.86] relationship here.
[754.24 → 754.68] God
[754.68 → 756.14] scripture says
[756.14 → 758.22] knows his people.
[758.22 → 762.96] Ezekiel 6.
[763.18 → 764.44] I threw this one in here
[764.44 → 765.96] because it made me
[765.96 → 766.48] uncomfortable.
[768.04 → 768.66] And sometimes
[768.66 → 769.54] I need to be uncomfortable.
[770.90 → 771.40] Ezekiel 6.
[771.46 → 772.54] This is about knowing here.
[772.74 → 773.90] Sometimes how we know.
[774.50 → 775.74] Then they will know
[775.74 → 776.24] when.
[776.72 → 777.72] Then they will know
[777.72 → 778.56] that I am the Lord.
[778.82 → 779.46] When the people
[779.46 → 780.32] lie slain
[780.32 → 781.12] among their idols
[781.12 → 781.62] among their
[781.62 → 783.44] among their altars
[783.44 → 784.66] on every high place
[784.66 → 786.08] and on all the mountains
[786.08 → 787.78] under every spreading
[787.78 → 789.18] tree and every leafy
[789.18 → 790.48] oak.
[790.82 → 791.60] Places where
[791.60 → 792.28] they offered
[792.28 → 793.28] fragrant incense
[793.28 → 794.24] to all their idols.
[794.62 → 795.30] Basically this
[795.30 → 796.24] this guy is saying
[796.24 → 796.88] you know
[796.88 → 798.72] they've been destroyed
[798.72 → 799.50] by knowing
[799.50 → 800.30] the wrong gods.
[801.98 → 803.70] And they'll know it
[803.70 → 806.84] when the ruin comes.
[806.84 → 808.94] And maybe
[808.94 → 809.30] maybe
[809.30 → 810.30] I was thinking
[810.30 → 810.76] on that.
[811.06 → 811.18] You know
[811.18 → 811.66] sometimes
[811.66 → 813.50] I got to know
[813.50 → 814.10] God
[814.10 → 815.18] when I went down
[815.18 → 816.62] a completely wrong path
[816.62 → 817.50] and it was an
[817.50 → 819.04] absolute disaster.
[819.98 → 821.34] And then the gift
[821.34 → 822.82] was the disaster.
[824.48 → 825.08] Right?
[826.14 → 827.12] The gift
[827.12 → 828.44] was the mess.
[831.96 → 832.88] And then somehow
[832.88 → 833.72] I know
[833.72 → 834.88] better.
[836.84 → 838.42] God
[838.42 → 839.50] knows us
[839.50 → 840.78] and he invites us
[840.78 → 841.58] to know him.
[842.06 → 842.72] This word
[842.72 → 843.60] occurs throughout
[843.60 → 844.22] the Psalms.
[844.62 → 845.74] Knowing is critical
[845.74 → 846.98] to deep relationships.
[847.82 → 847.98] You know
[847.98 → 849.62] my wife Candy
[849.62 → 851.02] knows me.
[851.48 → 851.80] And yes
[851.80 → 852.34] we've had
[852.34 → 853.06] four children
[853.06 → 853.60] so yes
[853.60 → 854.30] that way too.
[854.52 → 854.98] But I'm not
[854.98 → 855.98] talking about that.
[856.42 → 857.12] What I mean
[857.12 → 857.54] is this
[857.54 → 858.76] she knows
[858.76 → 859.82] my story.
[860.88 → 861.52] She knows
[861.52 → 862.12] the good
[862.12 → 862.84] the bad
[862.84 → 863.56] and the ugly
[863.56 → 864.96] and she loves
[864.96 → 866.12] me anyway.
[866.84 → 869.90] She loves me
[869.90 → 870.36] anyway.
[873.36 → 874.08] Love
[874.08 → 875.68] and knowing
[875.68 → 876.76] go together.
[877.92 → 879.14] If you love
[879.14 → 879.70] someone
[879.70 → 880.48] but there's
[880.48 → 881.34] stuff hidden
[881.34 → 883.48] you don't have
[883.48 → 884.10] the opportunity
[884.10 → 884.70] to love them
[884.70 → 885.32] so deeply
[885.32 → 886.22] it gets past
[886.22 → 887.10] whatever is
[887.10 → 887.80] unknown.
[888.72 → 889.36] When we try
[889.36 → 890.22] to hide things
[890.22 → 891.02] it doesn't
[891.02 → 891.84] build love
[891.84 → 892.68] it puts up
[892.68 → 893.32] walls and
[893.32 → 893.90] barriers
[893.90 → 895.16] to be
[895.16 → 895.82] known
[895.82 → 896.78] and loved.
[898.30 → 899.06] To be
[899.06 → 899.66] known
[899.66 → 900.24] and loved.
[900.36 → 901.24] That's love.
[902.68 → 903.52] Love knows
[903.52 → 903.96] and still
[903.96 → 904.42] loves.
[905.26 → 905.52] Scripture
[905.52 → 905.88] says
[905.88 → 906.84] Christ came
[906.84 → 907.14] to us
[907.14 → 907.88] while we
[907.88 → 908.68] were sinners
[908.68 → 909.74] not when we
[909.74 → 910.06] had our
[910.06 → 910.68] acts cleaned
[910.68 → 911.04] up.
[912.66 → 912.80] The
[912.80 → 913.30] Psalm says
[913.30 → 914.16] you discern
[914.16 → 914.44] Lord
[914.44 → 915.22] my thoughts
[915.22 → 915.78] you know
[915.78 → 916.54] every thought
[916.54 → 917.22] every act
[917.22 → 917.50] and you
[917.50 → 918.36] still seek
[918.36 → 918.92] me out.
[923.20 → 923.96] You still
[923.96 → 924.50] seek me out.
[925.34 → 925.92] God knows
[925.92 → 926.52] every you know
[926.52 → 927.04] all those ugly
[927.04 → 927.62] thoughts that you
[927.62 → 928.00] wouldn't want
[928.00 → 928.56] displayed on the
[928.56 → 928.78] screen.
[928.92 → 929.24] God knows
[929.24 → 929.74] every one of
[929.74 → 930.20] those thoughts
[930.20 → 931.56] and he still
[931.56 → 932.38] seeks you out.
[935.42 → 936.14] He still
[936.14 → 936.60] loves you.
[939.38 → 940.04] And then we
[940.04 → 940.66] think of God's
[940.66 → 941.18] thoughts and we
[941.18 → 941.90] go oh man
[941.90 → 943.60] God's thoughts.
[944.40 → 944.64] Wow.
[944.96 → 945.38] The vast
[945.38 → 945.90] sum of them.
[946.22 → 946.80] They're too
[946.80 → 947.32] much for me.
[948.36 → 950.66] But then we
[950.66 → 951.02] come to
[951.02 → 951.94] verse 19
[951.94 → 953.40] and beyond
[953.40 → 954.70] and we
[954.70 → 955.10] have a bit
[955.10 → 955.40] of a
[955.40 → 956.52] what feels
[956.52 → 956.94] like a bit
[956.94 → 957.34] of a funny
[957.34 → 958.36] turn in
[958.36 → 959.00] the Psalm
[959.00 → 960.74] here where
[960.74 → 961.14] we read
[961.14 → 961.50] this, and I'm
[961.50 → 961.80] just going to
[961.80 → 962.34] quickly read a
[962.34 → 962.72] little bit of
[962.72 → 963.82] it to you.
[964.40 → 964.92] If only God
[964.92 → 965.14] you would
[965.14 → 965.46] slay the
[965.46 → 965.94] wicked away
[965.94 → 966.44] from me you
[966.44 → 966.66] who are
[966.66 → 967.10] bloodthirsty
[967.10 → 967.70] they speak
[967.70 → 968.20] with evil
[968.20 → 968.72] intent your
[968.72 → 969.26] adversaries
[969.26 → 970.18] misuse your
[970.18 → 971.00] name do I
[971.00 → 971.38] not hate
[971.38 → 971.80] those who
[971.80 → 972.16] hate you
[972.16 → 972.52] Lord.
[975.22 → 975.88] Feels like
[975.88 → 976.36] a weird
[976.36 → 977.62] shift in
[977.62 → 978.04] the Psalm
[978.04 → 978.36] there.
[981.08 → 981.80] Sometimes you
[981.80 → 982.36] think what
[982.36 → 983.14] do I do
[983.14 → 983.56] with that
[983.56 → 983.84] there?
[986.12 → 986.74] And I
[986.74 → 987.10] was thinking
[987.10 → 987.94] what might
[987.94 → 988.72] it is like
[988.72 → 990.28] to be so
[990.28 → 991.02] convinced that
[991.02 → 991.74] an assault on
[991.74 → 992.38] one's own
[992.38 → 993.60] identity and
[993.60 → 994.24] thoughts is
[994.24 → 994.82] an assault
[994.82 → 996.34] on God.
[998.50 → 999.16] That's kind
[999.16 → 999.44] of what the
[999.44 → 999.80] Psalmist is
[999.80 → 1000.12] saying.
[1001.00 → 1001.72] I think the
[1001.72 → 1002.26] Psalmist
[1002.26 → 1003.44] I wrestled
[1003.44 → 1003.68] with this
[1003.68 → 1004.14] quite a bit
[1004.14 → 1004.48] this week.
[1004.48 → 1005.06] I think
[1005.06 → 1005.72] the Psalmist
[1005.72 → 1006.32] is right
[1006.32 → 1006.84] in trying
[1006.84 → 1007.44] to align
[1007.44 → 1008.22] his thoughts
[1008.22 → 1008.90] and his
[1008.90 → 1009.70] beliefs to
[1009.70 → 1010.22] God's.
[1011.36 → 1011.98] I think
[1011.98 → 1012.68] that's good.
[1012.76 → 1013.38] We need
[1013.38 → 1014.04] convictions
[1014.04 → 1015.14] based on
[1015.14 → 1015.86] God's will
[1015.86 → 1016.32] not just
[1016.32 → 1016.82] our human
[1016.82 → 1017.40] opinions.
[1017.98 → 1018.28] And it's
[1018.28 → 1018.74] good to be
[1018.74 → 1019.52] then passionate
[1019.52 → 1020.06] about
[1020.06 → 1020.74] righteousness.
[1021.84 → 1022.34] And those
[1022.34 → 1023.52] unrighteous
[1023.52 → 1024.10] beliefs,
[1024.28 → 1025.26] those things
[1025.26 → 1026.10] that are not
[1026.10 → 1026.78] what God
[1026.78 → 1027.26] intended,
[1027.60 → 1028.26] yes those
[1028.26 → 1028.86] things,
[1029.36 → 1030.16] those thoughts
[1030.16 → 1030.76] I would
[1030.76 → 1031.92] call enemies.
[1036.10 → 1036.94] But I know
[1036.94 → 1037.64] Scripture tells
[1037.64 → 1037.94] me in the
[1037.94 → 1038.32] New Testament
[1038.32 → 1038.88] to love my
[1038.88 → 1039.18] enemies.
[1041.94 → 1043.04] And remember
[1043.04 → 1043.84] Psalms are
[1043.84 → 1044.54] poems.
[1045.04 → 1045.74] The Psalmist
[1045.74 → 1046.42] is expressing
[1046.42 → 1047.08] his heart to
[1047.08 → 1047.30] God.
[1047.66 → 1048.58] It isn't
[1048.58 → 1050.14] always cozy
[1050.14 → 1050.82] and comfortable
[1050.82 → 1051.34] the way he
[1051.34 → 1052.38] expresses himself.
[1053.58 → 1054.10] So yes,
[1054.96 → 1055.32] yes,
[1055.72 → 1056.48] fight for
[1056.48 → 1057.04] truth.
[1057.48 → 1058.02] Fight for
[1058.02 → 1058.70] God's will
[1058.70 → 1059.52] in your life.
[1060.16 → 1061.16] Never let it
[1061.16 → 1061.64] turn that you
[1061.64 → 1062.44] hate people,
[1062.70 → 1063.24] but certainly
[1063.24 → 1063.88] that we
[1063.88 → 1064.72] hate evil.
[1069.12 → 1069.88] And here's
[1069.88 → 1070.56] a warning.
[1072.90 → 1073.40] Too many of
[1073.40 → 1073.90] us assume
[1073.90 → 1074.38] our thoughts
[1074.38 → 1074.84] must be
[1074.84 → 1075.32] aligned with
[1075.32 → 1075.80] God's.
[1079.40 → 1080.22] I think
[1080.22 → 1081.32] it must be
[1081.32 → 1081.70] from God
[1081.70 → 1081.90] too,
[1081.98 → 1082.16] right?
[1082.76 → 1083.48] God must
[1083.48 → 1084.36] have aligned
[1084.36 → 1084.94] his thoughts
[1084.94 → 1085.44] with my
[1085.44 → 1085.72] thoughts.
[1085.98 → 1086.32] We don't
[1086.32 → 1086.94] quite say it
[1086.94 → 1087.44] that way,
[1087.44 → 1088.20] but sometimes
[1088.20 → 1089.02] we act like
[1089.02 → 1089.72] it's so.
[1090.16 → 1091.10] And I'm
[1091.10 → 1091.76] reminded then,
[1091.96 → 1092.52] the Psalmist
[1092.52 → 1092.88] is saying,
[1093.24 → 1093.92] your thoughts,
[1094.08 → 1094.20] Lord,
[1094.86 → 1096.58] I don't get
[1096.58 → 1096.74] them,
[1096.80 → 1097.14] they're too
[1097.14 → 1097.94] big for me,
[1098.22 → 1098.60] but man,
[1098.66 → 1098.92] when I'm
[1098.92 → 1099.58] in a debate
[1099.58 → 1100.26] and I'm
[1100.26 → 1100.66] arguing,
[1101.28 → 1101.88] God must
[1101.88 → 1102.32] be thinking
[1102.32 → 1103.38] exactly like
[1103.38 → 1104.04] I think.
[1106.90 → 1107.60] Because my
[1107.60 → 1108.10] thoughts are
[1108.10 → 1110.02] exactly like
[1110.02 → 1110.36] God's,
[1110.36 → 1110.54] right?
[1114.54 → 1115.04] Look at
[1115.04 → 1115.90] Isaiah 55.
[1117.12 → 1117.62] Look at
[1117.62 → 1119.00] how God
[1119.00 → 1119.44] puts it.
[1121.36 → 1122.14] He writes,
[1123.32 → 1123.72] for my
[1123.72 → 1124.20] thoughts
[1124.20 → 1124.82] are not
[1124.82 → 1125.48] your thoughts,
[1126.08 → 1126.52] neither are
[1126.52 → 1127.14] my ways
[1127.14 → 1127.68] your ways,
[1127.74 → 1128.24] declares the
[1128.24 → 1128.48] Lord.
[1128.92 → 1129.28] As the
[1129.28 → 1129.68] heavens are
[1129.68 → 1130.20] higher than
[1130.20 → 1130.48] the earth,
[1130.60 → 1130.88] so are
[1130.88 → 1131.50] my ways
[1131.50 → 1132.14] higher than
[1132.14 → 1132.66] your ways,
[1133.02 → 1133.48] and my
[1133.48 → 1133.88] thoughts
[1133.88 → 1135.46] than your
[1135.46 → 1135.88] thoughts.
[1138.56 → 1139.16] And I'll
[1139.16 → 1139.50] say with the
[1139.50 → 1139.76] psalmist,
[1139.84 → 1140.36] such thoughts
[1140.36 → 1140.64] are too
[1140.64 → 1141.16] wonderful for
[1141.16 → 1141.34] me.
[1141.34 → 1149.16] I wrestle
[1149.16 → 1149.46] with
[1149.46 → 1149.94] sometimes
[1149.94 → 1150.32] the way
[1150.32 → 1151.32] we approach
[1151.32 → 1151.84] each other
[1151.84 → 1155.32] with
[1155.32 → 1155.78] differences.
[1158.28 → 1158.90] I don't
[1158.90 → 1159.22] have this
[1159.22 → 1159.64] written down,
[1159.74 → 1160.60] this is me
[1160.60 → 1160.82] now.
[1163.76 → 1164.48] I think
[1164.48 → 1164.82] we need
[1164.82 → 1165.40] to have a
[1165.40 → 1166.08] great sense
[1166.08 → 1166.72] of humility
[1166.72 → 1168.78] about our
[1168.78 → 1169.16] brilliant
[1169.16 → 1169.98] thoughts.
[1173.80 → 1174.68] And remind
[1174.68 → 1175.10] ourselves,
[1175.22 → 1175.82] God looks at
[1175.82 → 1176.10] you and
[1176.10 → 1176.38] says,
[1176.68 → 1177.66] my thoughts
[1177.66 → 1178.02] and your
[1178.02 → 1178.36] thoughts,
[1178.52 → 1180.20] they often
[1180.20 → 1180.76] don't align,
[1180.76 → 1182.48] and you
[1182.48 → 1182.82] don't even
[1182.82 → 1183.28] see it.
[1188.68 → 1189.36] I love
[1189.36 → 1189.70] that the
[1189.70 → 1190.10] psalmist,
[1190.36 → 1190.90] rather than
[1190.90 → 1191.44] hang out
[1191.44 → 1192.28] there in
[1192.28 → 1192.92] I hate
[1192.92 → 1193.32] my enemy
[1193.32 → 1193.72] land,
[1194.60 → 1195.68] he jumps
[1195.68 → 1196.72] suddenly then
[1196.72 → 1197.52] back to
[1197.52 → 1198.16] himself.
[1202.44 → 1203.02] And he
[1203.02 → 1203.30] says,
[1203.52 → 1203.74] Lord,
[1204.14 → 1205.30] search me.
[1205.48 → 1205.68] You know,
[1205.70 → 1206.18] if there's any
[1206.18 → 1206.80] offensive way
[1206.80 → 1207.14] in me,
[1207.44 → 1207.94] search me.
[1208.02 → 1208.36] Why does
[1208.36 → 1208.94] he suddenly
[1208.94 → 1209.80] go there?
[1211.08 → 1211.68] And I'm
[1211.68 → 1211.98] kind of
[1211.98 → 1212.26] hoping,
[1212.42 → 1212.78] and this
[1212.78 → 1213.28] may be,
[1213.40 → 1213.62] some of
[1213.62 → 1213.80] you may
[1213.80 → 1213.96] say,
[1214.08 → 1214.40] Sid,
[1214.44 → 1214.68] you read
[1214.68 → 1215.00] that one
[1215.00 → 1215.34] all wrong.
[1215.46 → 1215.64] Could
[1215.64 → 1215.92] be.
[1219.04 → 1219.56] But I
[1219.56 → 1220.04] can see
[1220.04 → 1220.52] myself,
[1220.62 → 1220.76] you know,
[1220.84 → 1220.98] you're
[1220.98 → 1221.14] saying,
[1221.22 → 1221.34] oh,
[1221.38 → 1221.58] man,
[1221.66 → 1222.48] there's this,
[1222.56 → 1222.90] there's this,
[1222.96 → 1223.12] there's this,
[1223.14 → 1224.02] these people,
[1224.14 → 1224.42] there's that,
[1224.48 → 1224.62] that,
[1224.62 → 1225.30] and then I
[1225.30 → 1226.22] look in the
[1226.22 → 1226.42] mirror and
[1226.42 → 1226.54] go,
[1226.64 → 1227.02] oh,
[1228.46 → 1228.86] oh,
[1228.94 → 1229.18] man.
[1231.06 → 1231.28] Ah.
[1232.48 → 1232.82] Sid,
[1232.90 → 1233.18] who are
[1233.18 → 1233.56] you to
[1233.56 → 1233.98] talk?
[1236.18 → 1236.70] Who are
[1236.70 → 1237.00] you to
[1237.00 → 1237.72] shoot your
[1237.72 → 1238.32] mouth off
[1238.32 → 1238.68] again?
[1240.76 → 1241.10] Lord,
[1241.38 → 1241.70] Lord,
[1241.76 → 1242.06] if there's
[1242.06 → 1242.72] any offensive
[1242.72 → 1243.14] way in
[1243.14 → 1243.28] me,
[1243.44 → 1244.12] any anxious
[1244.12 → 1244.62] thought in
[1244.62 → 1244.78] me,
[1244.98 → 1245.20] Lord,
[1245.34 → 1245.78] deal with
[1245.78 → 1246.24] me.
[1246.24 → 1246.28] I'm
[1246.28 → 1246.96] going to
[1246.96 → 1250.08] deal with
[1250.08 → 1250.24] me.
[1254.46 → 1255.02] Deal with
[1255.02 → 1255.22] me.
[1256.00 → 1256.54] Search me
[1256.54 → 1256.78] out.
[1257.66 → 1258.32] It starts
[1258.32 → 1258.72] that way in
[1258.72 → 1259.16] verse 1.
[1259.56 → 1260.24] In verse 1,
[1260.56 → 1260.76] Lord,
[1260.86 → 1261.16] you have
[1261.16 → 1261.76] searched me
[1261.76 → 1262.06] and have
[1262.06 → 1262.54] known me.
[1262.82 → 1263.16] And then we
[1263.16 → 1263.64] go through
[1263.64 → 1264.06] some of
[1264.06 → 1264.28] this,
[1264.56 → 1264.74] you know,
[1264.78 → 1265.08] I'm going to
[1265.08 → 1265.50] flee from
[1265.50 → 1265.66] God,
[1265.72 → 1265.96] I'm going to
[1265.96 → 1266.18] run,
[1266.54 → 1267.08] and then we
[1267.08 → 1267.48] go to this,
[1267.54 → 1267.66] well,
[1267.72 → 1267.84] you know,
[1267.84 → 1268.68] I hate
[1268.68 → 1269.54] the enemies.
[1270.14 → 1270.92] But then
[1270.92 → 1271.48] he ends
[1271.48 → 1271.78] again,
[1271.84 → 1272.06] so we
[1272.06 → 1272.62] started with
[1272.62 → 1273.12] search me,
[1273.22 → 1274.06] know me,
[1274.38 → 1274.58] and we
[1274.58 → 1274.68] say,
[1274.74 → 1275.20] now search
[1275.20 → 1275.90] me again.
[1278.74 → 1279.34] Search me
[1279.34 → 1279.72] again,
[1280.68 → 1280.98] because I
[1280.98 → 1281.50] probably need
[1281.50 → 1281.70] it.
[1282.74 → 1283.30] And then,
[1283.52 → 1283.96] then I
[1283.96 → 1284.18] think,
[1284.26 → 1285.08] so what's
[1285.08 → 1285.78] hemming me
[1285.78 → 1286.08] in?
[1286.26 → 1287.04] I'm hemmed
[1287.04 → 1287.64] in by this
[1287.64 → 1288.36] God who
[1288.36 → 1289.02] searched me
[1289.02 → 1289.56] and needs
[1289.56 → 1290.06] to search
[1290.06 → 1290.74] me again.
[1291.16 → 1291.44] And this
[1291.44 → 1292.60] can communicate,
[1292.70 → 1293.14] this hemming
[1293.14 → 1293.48] in can
[1293.48 → 1294.14] communicate both
[1294.14 → 1295.04] warning and
[1295.04 → 1295.48] protection,
[1295.62 → 1295.96] I think.
[1295.96 → 1297.56] we are
[1297.56 → 1298.06] hemmed
[1298.06 → 1298.50] in for
[1298.50 → 1298.94] our own
[1298.94 → 1299.32] good.
[1300.36 → 1300.62] I was
[1300.62 → 1301.06] thinking about
[1301.06 → 1301.18] it,
[1301.20 → 1301.36] you know,
[1301.38 → 1301.84] almost like
[1301.84 → 1302.86] one of
[1302.86 → 1303.68] those baby
[1303.68 → 1306.70] fences around,
[1306.80 → 1306.92] right?
[1306.96 → 1307.32] We hem
[1307.32 → 1307.64] in our
[1307.64 → 1308.22] kids when
[1308.22 → 1308.98] they're too
[1308.98 → 1309.46] little to
[1309.46 → 1310.60] be on their
[1310.60 → 1310.94] own here.
[1311.00 → 1311.28] We are
[1311.28 → 1311.72] hemmed
[1311.72 → 1311.98] in.
[1312.74 → 1313.14] God's
[1313.14 → 1313.46] good
[1313.46 → 1313.92] thoughts
[1313.92 → 1314.42] are there
[1314.42 → 1315.06] to guide
[1315.06 → 1315.88] us and
[1315.88 → 1316.36] to keep
[1316.36 → 1316.70] us on
[1316.70 → 1316.98] the way
[1316.98 → 1317.38] of life,
[1317.52 → 1318.02] to keep
[1318.02 → 1318.36] us from
[1318.36 → 1318.96] thinking too
[1318.96 → 1319.72] highly about
[1319.72 → 1320.44] our thoughts,
[1320.64 → 1321.30] to protect
[1321.30 → 1321.72] us from
[1321.72 → 1322.60] sin and
[1322.60 → 1322.76] our
[1322.76 → 1323.44] limitations.
[1323.90 → 1324.24] No
[1324.24 → 1324.80] pretending,
[1325.14 → 1325.78] just as
[1325.78 → 1326.26] I am,
[1326.56 → 1326.90] fully
[1326.90 → 1327.44] known,
[1327.94 → 1328.40] wonderfully
[1328.40 → 1328.92] made,
[1329.26 → 1330.34] but made
[1330.34 → 1332.02] as a
[1332.02 → 1332.80] human who
[1332.80 → 1333.22] is prone
[1333.22 → 1333.68] to wander,
[1333.82 → 1333.98] Lord,
[1334.04 → 1334.48] I feel it,
[1334.72 → 1335.26] prone to
[1335.26 → 1335.58] flee,
[1335.96 → 1336.36] prone to
[1336.36 → 1336.74] think I
[1336.74 → 1337.32] know better
[1337.32 → 1337.90] than God
[1337.90 → 1338.30] and others,
[1338.70 → 1339.30] hemmed in
[1339.30 → 1340.10] by God's
[1340.10 → 1340.42] way of
[1340.42 → 1341.18] healthy living,
[1341.54 → 1342.02] by His
[1342.02 → 1342.54] laws.
[1343.54 → 1343.68] So,
[1343.78 → 1344.02] yes,
[1345.62 → 1346.10] the psalm
[1346.10 → 1347.82] begins with
[1347.82 → 1348.36] understanding
[1348.36 → 1348.96] that God
[1348.96 → 1349.70] has searched
[1349.70 → 1350.06] us,
[1350.66 → 1351.00] and it
[1351.00 → 1351.34] ends with
[1351.34 → 1351.70] a plea
[1351.70 → 1352.12] for God
[1352.12 → 1352.50] to search
[1352.50 → 1352.90] us again.
[1352.90 → 1357.48] to find
[1357.48 → 1358.02] any offensive
[1358.02 → 1358.68] way to
[1358.68 → 1359.46] deal with
[1359.46 → 1360.28] any anxiety
[1360.28 → 1360.68] that I'm
[1360.68 → 1361.04] holding,
[1361.54 → 1362.00] and then I
[1362.00 → 1362.38] want to say
[1362.38 → 1362.78] thank you,
[1362.86 → 1362.98] Lord,
[1363.06 → 1363.56] for having me
[1363.56 → 1363.74] in.
[1365.74 → 1366.06] Glossophobia
[1366.06 → 1366.60] and all.
[1368.28 → 1368.88] Thanks for
[1368.88 → 1369.26] having me
[1369.26 → 1369.48] in,
[1369.98 → 1370.78] because I
[1370.78 → 1371.18] need it.
[1373.40 → 1373.68] And I
[1373.68 → 1373.96] guess I'm
[1373.96 → 1374.24] going to ask
[1374.24 → 1374.50] you this,
[1374.54 → 1374.78] are you
[1374.78 → 1375.24] willing to be
[1375.24 → 1375.48] searched
[1375.48 → 1376.02] like that,
[1376.68 → 1379.30] to see if
[1379.30 → 1379.74] there's any
[1379.74 → 1380.44] wicked,
[1380.44 → 1381.76] any wrong
[1381.76 → 1382.54] way in
[1382.54 → 1382.86] you.
[1386.28 → 1387.28] Things might
[1387.28 → 1387.94] turn up
[1387.94 → 1388.40] that we'd
[1388.40 → 1389.22] rather leave
[1389.22 → 1389.78] covered.
[1391.72 → 1392.26] The psalmist
[1392.26 → 1392.74] starts with
[1392.74 → 1393.26] high praise
[1393.26 → 1393.62] for the
[1393.62 → 1394.02] Creator.
[1394.56 → 1395.12] He hates
[1395.12 → 1395.62] those who
[1395.62 → 1396.22] are against
[1396.22 → 1396.48] God.
[1396.56 → 1396.94] I think it's
[1396.94 → 1397.40] right to
[1397.40 → 1397.90] hate evil
[1397.90 → 1398.84] without hating
[1398.84 → 1399.34] people.
[1399.88 → 1400.26] And then he
[1400.26 → 1400.98] turns inward
[1400.98 → 1401.86] to his
[1401.86 → 1402.54] heart.
[1403.90 → 1404.50] And our
[1404.50 → 1405.04] heart should
[1405.04 → 1405.64] break with
[1405.64 → 1405.94] evil.
[1407.12 → 1407.62] It should.
[1408.98 → 1409.24] You know,
[1409.30 → 1410.12] we should
[1410.12 → 1411.20] watch the
[1411.20 → 1411.72] news and
[1411.72 → 1412.10] weep
[1412.10 → 1412.52] sometimes.
[1412.82 → 1413.36] We should
[1413.36 → 1414.12] look within
[1414.12 → 1414.96] and grieve.
[1415.30 → 1416.30] Children killed
[1416.30 → 1416.72] in wars.
[1416.86 → 1417.50] Refugees
[1417.50 → 1417.82] fleeing.
[1418.14 → 1418.54] Families
[1418.54 → 1419.30] falling apart
[1419.30 → 1419.80] relationally.
[1420.10 → 1420.46] Cancer
[1420.46 → 1421.32] taking lives.
[1421.68 → 1422.20] Abuse.
[1422.82 → 1423.44] Ugliness in
[1423.44 → 1423.76] the world
[1423.76 → 1424.42] around us
[1424.42 → 1425.04] and in us.
[1425.34 → 1425.76] So many
[1425.76 → 1426.36] injustices.
[1426.50 → 1426.88] So many
[1426.88 → 1427.40] horrors.
[1428.34 → 1428.58] And the
[1428.58 → 1428.94] psalmist
[1428.94 → 1429.76] calls God
[1429.76 → 1430.66] to remove
[1430.66 → 1431.18] all that
[1431.18 → 1431.48] evil.
[1431.80 → 1432.30] And that's
[1432.30 → 1432.66] what the
[1432.66 → 1433.30] cross is
[1433.30 → 1433.68] about.
[1438.16 → 1438.42] So,
[1438.42 → 1439.96] Lord,
[1440.06 → 1440.84] look deeply,
[1441.36 → 1442.32] look deeply
[1442.32 → 1443.06] into this
[1443.06 → 1443.54] heart.
[1446.10 → 1446.96] Into this
[1446.96 → 1447.24] heart.
[1451.24 → 1452.10] So that I
[1452.10 → 1452.40] may have
[1452.40 → 1452.68] deeper
[1452.68 → 1453.04] communion
[1453.04 → 1453.58] with God.
[1455.46 → 1456.14] When I
[1456.14 → 1456.36] was a
[1456.36 → 1456.56] kid,
[1457.86 → 1459.56] churches
[1459.56 → 1460.36] typically
[1460.36 → 1460.94] announced
[1460.94 → 1461.50] communion
[1461.50 → 1462.80] a week or
[1462.80 → 1463.42] so ahead
[1463.42 → 1463.94] of time.
[1463.94 → 1465.26] and the
[1465.26 → 1465.70] intent
[1465.70 → 1466.28] was that
[1466.28 → 1466.52] you would
[1466.52 → 1467.06] then spend
[1467.06 → 1467.96] that week
[1467.96 → 1469.40] searching
[1469.40 → 1470.72] out where
[1470.72 → 1471.06] your heart
[1471.06 → 1471.44] was.
[1473.48 → 1474.04] It's a good
[1474.04 → 1474.44] practice.
[1474.84 → 1475.46] I'm not sure
[1475.46 → 1475.68] how many
[1475.68 → 1476.40] people put it
[1476.40 → 1476.94] into practice
[1476.94 → 1477.36] but it was a
[1477.36 → 1478.14] good thought.
[1479.08 → 1479.22] You know,
[1479.28 → 1479.84] you prepare
[1479.84 → 1480.58] your heart
[1480.58 → 1481.54] to come to
[1481.54 → 1481.98] the table.
[1484.34 → 1484.82] Look at
[1484.82 → 1485.48] Hebrews 4.
[1486.32 → 1487.04] I love this
[1487.04 → 1487.40] and I had to
[1487.40 → 1487.74] put it on
[1487.74 → 1487.96] here.
[1488.14 → 1488.68] Hebrews 4.
[1489.32 → 1489.64] For the
[1489.64 → 1490.40] word of God
[1490.40 → 1491.16] is alive
[1491.16 → 1492.24] and active,
[1492.24 → 1493.82] sharper than
[1493.82 → 1494.32] any double
[1494.32 → 1494.68] edged sword.
[1494.84 → 1495.92] It penetrates
[1495.92 → 1496.32] even to
[1496.32 → 1497.08] dividing soul
[1497.08 → 1497.52] and spirit,
[1497.86 → 1498.24] joint and
[1498.24 → 1498.46] marrow.
[1498.68 → 1499.24] It judges
[1499.24 → 1499.76] the thoughts
[1499.76 → 1499.96] and the
[1499.96 → 1500.44] attitudes of
[1500.44 → 1500.72] the heart.
[1501.10 → 1501.58] Nothing in
[1501.58 → 1502.18] all creation
[1502.18 → 1502.56] is hidden
[1502.56 → 1503.18] from God's
[1503.18 → 1503.34] sight.
[1504.06 → 1504.50] Everything
[1504.50 → 1507.18] is uncovered
[1507.18 → 1507.88] and laid
[1507.88 → 1508.52] bare before
[1508.52 → 1509.18] the eyes of
[1509.18 → 1509.74] him to whom
[1509.74 → 1510.20] you must give
[1510.20 → 1510.50] account.
[1510.88 → 1511.38] And maybe
[1511.38 → 1512.14] at that point
[1512.14 → 1512.74] your knees
[1512.74 → 1513.38] are shaken.
[1515.58 → 1516.00] But let's
[1516.00 → 1516.44] read on.
[1517.08 → 1517.56] Therefore,
[1518.46 → 1519.04] since we have
[1519.04 → 1519.72] a great high
[1519.72 → 1520.02] priest,
[1520.12 → 1520.32] Jesus,
[1520.44 → 1520.68] who has
[1520.68 → 1521.32] ascended into
[1521.32 → 1521.54] heaven,
[1521.54 → 1522.12] Jesus,
[1522.28 → 1522.60] the Son of
[1522.60 → 1522.76] God,
[1522.92 → 1523.28] let us
[1523.28 → 1523.88] hold firmly
[1523.88 → 1524.26] to the
[1524.26 → 1524.70] faith we
[1524.70 → 1525.18] profess.
[1525.66 → 1526.00] For we
[1526.00 → 1526.36] do not
[1526.36 → 1526.58] have a
[1526.58 → 1527.20] high priest
[1527.20 → 1527.86] who is
[1527.86 → 1528.36] unable to
[1528.36 → 1529.18] empathize
[1529.18 → 1529.72] with our
[1529.72 → 1530.08] weaknesses.
[1530.34 → 1530.70] We have
[1530.70 → 1530.98] one who
[1530.98 → 1531.22] has been
[1531.22 → 1531.78] tempted in
[1531.78 → 1532.32] every way
[1532.32 → 1532.92] just as
[1532.92 → 1533.38] we are,
[1533.72 → 1534.12] yet he
[1534.12 → 1534.54] did not
[1534.54 → 1534.86] sin.
[1536.84 → 1537.34] Because of
[1537.34 → 1537.54] him,
[1537.94 → 1538.32] let us
[1538.32 → 1539.02] then approach
[1539.02 → 1539.80] God's
[1539.80 → 1540.48] throne of
[1540.48 → 1540.88] grace,
[1541.60 → 1542.08] approach
[1542.08 → 1542.70] the table,
[1542.88 → 1543.18] approach
[1543.18 → 1543.88] God with
[1543.88 → 1544.96] confidence so
[1544.96 → 1545.42] that we may
[1545.42 → 1546.16] receive mercy
[1546.16 → 1546.58] and find
[1546.58 → 1547.48] grace to
[1547.48 → 1547.98] help us in
[1547.98 → 1548.50] our time of
[1548.50 → 1548.72] need.
[1549.26 → 1549.94] That's the
[1549.94 → 1550.48] point of the
[1550.48 → 1550.74] search.
[1550.74 → 1551.88] This is a
[1551.88 → 1552.56] search to
[1552.56 → 1553.58] be known.
[1554.24 → 1555.00] God knows
[1555.00 → 1555.24] you.
[1555.58 → 1556.02] Maybe you
[1556.02 → 1556.38] need to
[1556.38 → 1557.02] know yourself
[1557.02 → 1557.32] a little
[1557.32 → 1557.70] deeper.
[1560.42 → 1561.14] One writer
[1561.14 → 1561.88] describes us
[1561.88 → 1562.50] being known
[1562.50 → 1563.18] by God as
[1563.18 → 1563.62] being laid
[1563.62 → 1564.02] bare and
[1564.02 → 1564.50] stripped of
[1564.50 → 1565.20] all facades.
[1566.58 → 1567.52] In the deep
[1567.52 → 1568.24] presence of
[1568.24 → 1568.84] God, we are
[1568.84 → 1569.54] relieved from
[1569.54 → 1570.22] the necessity
[1570.22 → 1571.18] to pretend.
[1571.18 → 1575.42] loved and
[1575.42 → 1575.98] still loved.
[1577.72 → 1578.64] Love and
[1578.64 → 1578.98] knowing.
[1580.98 → 1581.68] Because our
[1581.68 → 1582.24] sins and our
[1582.24 → 1582.92] limitations have
[1582.92 → 1583.26] been dealt
[1583.26 → 1583.70] with at the
[1583.70 → 1584.06] cross.
[1584.84 → 1585.22] And our
[1585.22 → 1586.04] valued and
[1586.04 → 1586.88] true identity
[1586.88 → 1587.80] is found in
[1587.80 → 1588.40] this God who
[1588.40 → 1589.04] loves us and
[1589.04 → 1589.64] created us.
[1589.96 → 1590.46] This God who
[1590.46 → 1591.22] made us fearfully
[1591.22 → 1591.64] and wonderfully
[1591.64 → 1591.90] made.
[1592.26 → 1592.76] We are his
[1592.76 → 1593.14] children.
[1593.58 → 1594.34] That's who we
[1594.34 → 1594.62] are.
[1594.62 → 1594.68] We are.
[1594.68 → 1598.64] No other
[1598.64 → 1599.58] identity matters
[1599.58 → 1600.92] but that you
[1600.92 → 1601.86] are a child
[1601.86 → 1602.56] of God.
[1607.24 → 1607.80] You know, I
[1607.80 → 1608.08] was thinking
[1608.08 → 1608.38] about this.
[1608.66 → 1609.36] I'm sure many
[1609.36 → 1609.68] of you have
[1609.68 → 1610.08] gone to the
[1610.08 → 1610.62] doctor for a
[1610.62 → 1610.88] physical.
[1611.60 → 1611.96] It's a good
[1611.96 → 1612.46] thing to do.
[1613.86 → 1614.90] In a sense, I
[1614.90 → 1615.30] think when we
[1615.30 → 1615.86] invite God to
[1615.86 → 1616.32] search us, in
[1616.32 → 1617.32] a sense, instead
[1617.32 → 1617.86] of calling it a
[1617.86 → 1618.22] physical, we
[1618.22 → 1618.74] can call it a
[1618.74 → 1619.02] spiritual.
[1620.54 → 1621.28] God is going
[1621.28 → 1621.72] to search for
[1621.72 → 1622.20] no offensive
[1622.20 → 1622.66] ways, no
[1622.66 → 1623.22] anxious thoughts.
[1623.72 → 1624.34] I have become
[1624.34 → 1625.52] increasingly aware
[1625.52 → 1626.16] the older I
[1626.16 → 1626.98] get of the
[1626.98 → 1627.72] enormous amount
[1627.72 → 1628.20] of activity
[1628.20 → 1628.92] inside of me
[1628.92 → 1629.76] that I neither
[1629.76 → 1630.94] understand nor
[1630.94 → 1631.78] fully control.
[1633.62 → 1634.14] Impressions,
[1634.44 → 1634.80] urges,
[1634.98 → 1635.52] motivations,
[1635.94 → 1636.30] judgments.
[1637.78 → 1638.36] I kind of
[1638.36 → 1639.20] agree with
[1639.20 → 1640.24] Jeremiah sometimes.
[1640.40 → 1641.30] Jeremiah 17
[1641.30 → 1642.02] verse 9 where
[1642.02 → 1642.62] we read,
[1643.04 → 1643.60] the heart is
[1643.60 → 1644.96] deceitful above
[1644.96 → 1645.82] all things and
[1645.82 → 1646.70] beyond cure.
[1648.56 → 1649.34] Who can
[1649.34 → 1650.12] understand it?
[1650.74 → 1651.04] And I'd
[1651.04 → 1651.38] probably say
[1651.38 → 1651.78] to them, yeah,
[1652.02 → 1652.68] I'm with you
[1652.68 → 1653.22] Jeremiah, who
[1653.22 → 1654.12] can understand
[1654.12 → 1654.46] the heart.
[1654.54 → 1655.08] I don't.
[1655.50 → 1656.00] And so we
[1656.00 → 1656.54] need these
[1656.54 → 1657.16] periodical
[1657.16 → 1657.82] physicals, but
[1657.82 → 1658.08] we need
[1658.08 → 1658.64] periodical
[1658.64 → 1659.26] spirituals.
[1659.82 → 1660.32] But you
[1660.32 → 1661.18] can't just
[1661.18 → 1662.02] be the
[1662.02 → 1662.86] searching thing.
[1663.18 → 1663.82] God does
[1663.82 → 1664.44] it, but I
[1664.44 → 1664.76] think he
[1664.76 → 1665.20] does it
[1665.20 → 1665.92] sometimes through
[1665.92 → 1666.32] people.
[1666.52 → 1666.88] So you
[1666.88 → 1667.52] can't be
[1667.52 → 1668.06] just your
[1668.06 → 1668.86] own examiner.
[1670.08 → 1670.36] Somebody
[1670.36 → 1670.72] said this,
[1670.76 → 1671.10] the doctor
[1671.10 → 1671.60] who treats
[1671.60 → 1672.10] himself has
[1672.10 → 1672.38] a fool
[1672.38 → 1672.68] for a
[1672.68 → 1672.96] patient.
[1675.12 → 1675.40] And I
[1675.40 → 1675.78] think that's
[1675.78 → 1676.32] us when we
[1676.32 → 1677.42] attempt to
[1677.42 → 1678.22] only look at
[1678.22 → 1678.64] our own
[1678.64 → 1679.26] lives through
[1679.26 → 1679.66] our own
[1679.66 → 1680.02] lens.
[1680.02 → 1683.18] Dorothea
[1683.18 → 1683.78] of Gaza
[1683.78 → 1684.42] said, I
[1684.42 → 1685.04] know, and
[1685.04 → 1685.82] he worked
[1685.82 → 1686.30] with monks,
[1686.48 → 1686.62] and he
[1686.62 → 1687.08] said, I
[1687.08 → 1687.34] know of
[1687.34 → 1687.94] no falling
[1687.94 → 1688.32] away of
[1688.32 → 1688.72] a monk
[1688.72 → 1689.46] which did
[1689.46 → 1689.94] not come
[1689.94 → 1690.28] from his
[1690.28 → 1691.26] reliance on
[1691.26 → 1691.58] his own
[1691.58 → 1692.04] sentiments.
[1692.70 → 1693.28] Nothing is
[1693.28 → 1693.86] more pitiful,
[1693.98 → 1694.46] nothing more
[1694.46 → 1695.70] disastrous than
[1695.70 → 1696.32] to be one's
[1696.32 → 1696.98] own spiritual
[1696.98 → 1697.50] director.
[1699.98 → 1700.52] Well, you're
[1700.52 → 1700.86] going to figure
[1700.86 → 1701.30] it out, right?
[1702.26 → 1702.74] You're going to
[1702.74 → 1703.24] figure it out.
[1703.24 → 1705.28] 1 Timothy 4,
[1706.20 → 1707.78] verse 16,
[1707.90 → 1708.16] that in the
[1708.16 → 1708.40] New Living
[1708.40 → 1708.88] Translation
[1708.88 → 1710.40] says, keep
[1710.40 → 1711.38] a close eye
[1711.38 → 1712.10] on how you
[1712.10 → 1713.20] live, and I
[1713.20 → 1713.54] think you need
[1713.54 → 1713.96] help in doing
[1713.96 → 1714.94] that, and on
[1714.94 → 1715.52] your teachings,
[1715.64 → 1716.14] your doctrines.
[1716.56 → 1717.24] Stay true to
[1717.24 → 1717.74] what is right
[1717.74 → 1718.24] for the sake
[1718.24 → 1718.68] of your own
[1718.68 → 1719.74] salvation, and
[1719.74 → 1720.50] for the salvation
[1720.50 → 1721.26] of those who
[1721.26 → 1722.12] hear you.
[1724.08 → 1724.62] In this
[1724.62 → 1725.32] openness for
[1725.32 → 1725.76] God to
[1725.76 → 1726.28] search you,
[1726.42 → 1726.98] invite others
[1726.98 → 1727.34] into the
[1727.34 → 1727.86] process.
[1729.04 → 1729.56] What might
[1729.56 → 1730.40] this periodic
[1730.40 → 1731.60] spiritual look
[1731.60 → 1731.94] like?
[1732.30 → 1732.72] So what
[1732.72 → 1733.08] might this
[1733.08 → 1733.74] reflection look
[1733.74 → 1733.88] like?
[1734.04 → 1734.44] And if I
[1734.44 → 1735.08] were the
[1735.08 → 1735.70] doctor here,
[1736.08 → 1736.68] I'd start
[1736.68 → 1737.12] with asking
[1737.12 → 1737.48] you some
[1737.48 → 1737.88] questions.
[1737.96 → 1738.18] I'm going
[1738.18 → 1738.44] to just
[1738.44 → 1738.74] give you
[1738.74 → 1739.24] some sample
[1739.24 → 1739.66] questions.
[1740.06 → 1740.60] Maybe one
[1740.60 → 1741.16] or two will
[1741.16 → 1741.68] stick with
[1741.68 → 1742.44] you, and
[1742.44 → 1743.14] maybe ask
[1743.14 → 1743.78] yourself these
[1743.78 → 1744.32] questions.
[1748.60 → 1749.34] Does my
[1749.34 → 1751.82] patient still
[1751.82 → 1752.52] truly believe
[1752.52 → 1753.00] that Jesus
[1753.00 → 1753.58] is his or
[1753.58 → 1754.10] her Saviour,
[1754.84 → 1755.22] and does
[1755.22 → 1755.88] the joy of
[1755.88 → 1756.68] that hour I
[1756.68 → 1757.82] first believed
[1757.82 → 1758.70] still exist?
[1761.30 → 1762.30] How passionate
[1762.30 → 1762.82] do you feel
[1762.82 → 1763.40] about Christ?
[1766.72 → 1767.38] When was
[1767.38 → 1767.94] the last
[1767.94 → 1769.06] time you
[1769.06 → 1769.70] returned to
[1769.70 → 1770.30] the cross
[1770.30 → 1771.54] and reaffirmed
[1771.54 → 1772.24] your decision
[1772.24 → 1772.68] to follow
[1772.68 → 1773.06] Jesus?
[1775.06 → 1775.52] The start
[1775.52 → 1775.84] of a new
[1775.84 → 1776.36] year is always
[1776.36 → 1776.78] a good time
[1776.78 → 1777.32] to do that.
[1778.58 → 1778.86] And let me
[1778.86 → 1779.44] say, I think
[1779.44 → 1779.96] it's important
[1779.96 → 1780.40] even to
[1780.40 → 1781.14] reenlist each
[1781.14 → 1781.44] and every
[1781.44 → 1782.30] morning with
[1782.30 → 1782.90] the appreciation
[1782.90 → 1784.42] of Jesus as
[1784.42 → 1785.82] your Saviour at
[1785.82 → 1786.38] the start of
[1786.38 → 1786.98] each new
[1786.98 → 1787.36] day.
[1787.36 → 1789.90] another question,
[1789.98 → 1790.56] are there any
[1790.56 → 1791.24] events in your
[1791.24 → 1792.88] past plaguing
[1792.88 → 1793.76] you, resentments,
[1793.88 → 1794.30] unresolved
[1794.30 → 1795.20] conflicts, regrets,
[1795.38 → 1796.26] desires, behaviours?
[1798.26 → 1798.76] How about this?
[1799.18 → 1800.58] How is your
[1800.58 → 1801.16] willingness to
[1801.16 → 1801.74] forgive others?
[1802.60 → 1803.18] How about your
[1803.18 → 1804.24] willingness to
[1804.24 → 1804.60] repent?
[1807.42 → 1808.14] How about this
[1808.14 → 1808.44] question?
[1808.52 → 1809.18] How important is
[1809.18 → 1809.66] it for you to be
[1809.66 → 1809.94] right?
[1813.68 → 1814.48] How as important
[1814.48 → 1815.10] is it for you to be
[1815.10 → 1815.64] acknowledged?
[1818.26 → 1819.18] How good do you
[1819.18 → 1819.90] take criticism?
[1822.96 → 1823.98] Do you love your
[1823.98 → 1825.52] spouse more than
[1825.52 → 1826.24] you did a year ago?
[1828.04 → 1828.72] How about your
[1828.72 → 1829.04] kids?
[1830.72 → 1831.52] Are you a good
[1831.52 → 1831.84] friend?
[1835.44 → 1836.88] We submit to
[1836.88 → 1838.14] God's search to
[1838.14 → 1839.46] spiritual, not
[1839.46 → 1840.08] merely for the
[1840.08 → 1840.64] sake of self
[1840.64 → 1842.58] improvement and
[1842.58 → 1843.70] self-interest,
[1843.84 → 1844.98] nor to earn
[1844.98 → 1845.84] God's love,
[1846.20 → 1846.98] but to have
[1846.98 → 1847.44] our lives
[1847.44 → 1848.12] centred more
[1848.12 → 1848.80] and more on
[1848.80 → 1849.98] Christ so we
[1849.98 → 1850.42] can serve
[1850.42 → 1851.50] others in
[1851.50 → 1851.92] His name.
[1853.92 → 1854.54] We're going
[1854.54 → 1854.66] to the
[1854.66 → 1857.68] first
[1857.68 → 1858.08] message.
