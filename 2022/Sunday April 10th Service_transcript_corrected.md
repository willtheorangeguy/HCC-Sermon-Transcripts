[0.00 → 3.66] Good morning.
[6.66 → 12.48] It's always good to be together and gather for worship.
[12.48 → 18.54] It was lovely to see the children this morning and hear their little voices and watch their enthusiasm.
[19.20 → 21.04] It was a lovely blessing as well.
[21.48 → 26.06] So thank you for all those who participated and worked on that.
[26.06 → 38.26] Last week, Pastor Dave led us through the part of John's Gospel where Jesus prays prior to his death.
[39.58 → 43.66] And in a sense, he's saying goodbye to his friends before he dies.
[45.70 → 48.50] In that prayer, he prayed for unity.
[49.92 → 55.84] But this wasn't a unity about just getting along or about not just not fighting.
[56.06 → 58.88] He prays, and he prayed for oneness.
[60.04 → 62.04] Oneness like the Trinity has.
[63.12 → 64.22] Think about that.
[64.30 → 67.26] Father, Son, Holy Spirit, one.
[68.18 → 70.22] And we are invited into that.
[71.40 → 73.08] A kingdom of oneness.
[73.58 → 75.86] A kingdom of profound unity.
[77.54 → 81.76] As Pastor Dave said last week, a unity too often not reflected very well in the church.
[81.76 → 83.58] And I remember the number, right?
[83.58 → 86.04] 36,000 plus denominations.
[86.74 → 90.22] Not a very good indication of oneness.
[91.64 → 100.42] And, you know, we've heard maybe you have too many stories of disunity over COVID and over issues and dynamics.
[100.42 → 108.86] And we've heard other churches where there's unhealthy dynamics and hurt and too much disunity.
[110.70 → 112.06] And I think of Jesus' prayer.
[112.32 → 117.96] Father, may they be one as we are one.
[117.96 → 121.32] And I thought the bar couldn't be any higher.
[123.24 → 127.38] And I was picturing the disciples hearing those words, those incredible words.
[127.76 → 133.08] And how inspired they would be to participate in helping to build that kind of oneness.
[133.36 → 135.46] And immediately they're all in.
[136.94 → 137.78] As if.
[139.24 → 140.22] Because they aren't.
[140.22 → 148.30] And suddenly that story of promised oneness takes what seems like an exact opposite turn of direction.
[149.10 → 155.62] And we read of the betrayals and abandonment and violence and false judgments and arrest.
[156.32 → 157.12] The arrest of Jesus.
[158.26 → 160.12] So let's jump into today's passage.
[160.38 → 162.40] We're reading out of John 18.
[163.08 → 166.00] It'll be up on the screen or if you want to open your Bibles to it.
[166.60 → 167.64] That's all good.
[167.64 → 167.70] Thank you.
[170.22 → 174.38] And here we start off just with when he had finished praying.
[175.64 → 180.32] And when he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley.
[181.02 → 185.16] And on the other side there was a garden and he and his disciples went into it.
[185.80 → 191.60] And now Judas, who had betrayed him, knew the place because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.
[192.02 → 198.42] So Judas came to the garden guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and the Pharisees.
[198.42 → 201.54] And they were carrying torches and lanterns and weapons.
[202.92 → 207.00] Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them,
[207.34 → 208.46] Who is it you want?
[209.40 → 211.06] Jesus of Nazareth, they replied.
[211.70 → 213.44] I am he, Jesus said.
[214.32 → 216.38] And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.
[216.72 → 221.52] And when Jesus said, I am he, they drew back and fell to the ground.
[221.52 → 225.08] Again, he asked them, Who is it you want?
[225.30 → 226.82] Jesus of Nazareth, they said.
[227.20 → 230.00] And Jesus answered, I told you that I am he.
[230.62 → 233.06] If you are looking for me, then let these men go.
[233.42 → 237.62] And this happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled.
[237.96 → 240.84] I have not lost one of those you gave me.
[240.84 → 248.00] Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear.
[248.86 → 250.30] The servant's name was Malchus.
[250.88 → 253.36] And Jesus commanded Peter, Put your sword away.
[253.52 → 256.46] Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?
[257.50 → 262.48] Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus.
[262.98 → 268.68] They bound him and brought him first to Anna's, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.
[268.68 → 275.68] Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people.
[276.78 → 280.50] Some translations, better one man died than a whole nation.
[282.18 → 285.70] In this chapter, remember the prayer was about oneness.
[285.90 → 295.28] In this chapter, I want to look at human attempts for unity that we see in this chapter where Jesus shows the path to unity.
[295.28 → 304.44] Because we can all say we follow Jesus, yet at the same time, we too often live by other agendas that are at work in our lives.
[305.12 → 307.16] So let's look at a few examples out of this chapter.
[307.46 → 313.44] First we have Judas, betraying the one he followed because he didn't think Jesus really knew what he was doing anymore.
[314.38 → 315.58] Don't read Judas wrong.
[315.66 → 317.80] He was a genuine follower of Jesus.
[318.58 → 319.68] He was in on it.
[319.80 → 321.70] You know, we want to demonize Judas sometimes.
[321.78 → 322.48] We shouldn't do that.
[322.48 → 324.66] He was the guy who was all in.
[324.66 → 328.08] He was trustworthy enough because they put him in charge of the money.
[328.20 → 329.94] I mean, there are a lot of things we could say about Judas.
[330.42 → 336.54] But, you know, he now thinks Jesus has lost his way and Judas figures he knows better.
[337.66 → 345.24] I mean, there's no way Jesus' plan is going to drive out the Roman occupiers and reestablish Israel.
[345.80 → 348.52] I mean, how is his death going to help that?
[348.52 → 355.20] And so he comes with a bunch of soldiers, one's Rome allowed the Jewish leaders to have, to do their bidding.
[356.30 → 359.24] Judas now has his own plans.
[360.00 → 362.38] And they're not the same ones that Jesus has.
[363.72 → 366.04] And then when we read verse 14 where it says,
[366.16 → 371.58] Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people.
[372.00 → 373.84] Caiaphas has a plan for unity too.
[373.84 → 376.40] These leaders are in a difficult position.
[376.60 → 377.60] Rome is in charge.
[377.92 → 383.26] They walk this delicate balance of being an occupied people still trying to lead the people to Israel.
[383.58 → 386.80] And these guys are really super interested in keeping their power.
[387.64 → 388.96] So there's a lot going on there.
[389.06 → 391.18] They're juggling quite a bit.
[391.78 → 394.84] And Jesus is truly messing with their plans.
[395.60 → 398.16] He's offering some other path.
[398.16 → 404.54] Ironic that they say better one man die because that is absolutely true.
[404.80 → 409.64] It is much better that this one man die for the sake of the world.
[410.62 → 412.44] Of course, only Jesus knows that.
[413.68 → 416.96] And then this gang of thugs really does the dirty work for the priest.
[417.60 → 423.56] Judas betrays his Lord because he has his own agenda at work here.
[423.56 → 429.98] More than Jesus' crazy plan that you're going to win by dying.
[431.48 → 433.20] So there's another agenda going on.
[433.48 → 434.22] And then we have Peter.
[435.08 → 437.46] Peter jumps all in with his sword.
[437.90 → 439.64] I mean, he comes prepared.
[441.06 → 441.24] Right?
[441.42 → 442.68] You know, there's all in.
[443.02 → 444.06] He's ready to go.
[444.24 → 445.10] Typically impulsive.
[445.38 → 447.84] And he cuts off the ear of the high priest's servant.
[448.26 → 450.22] He's even named Malchus.
[450.22 → 452.64] I sometimes love John's details.
[452.64 → 454.86] He even tells us it was the right ear.
[456.00 → 457.78] You know, it's kind of an odd detail.
[457.94 → 459.00] I mean, it could have been either.
[459.14 → 460.00] It really wouldn't matter.
[460.38 → 466.82] And maybe, you know, by the way, in other gospels, we know that Jesus heals that servant as well.
[466.90 → 468.52] Just to demonstrate who he is, of course.
[469.20 → 470.98] And to bless the man.
[471.50 → 475.48] And you might react to the story of the sword with a number of reactions.
[475.60 → 477.08] A lot of you might go, ew, that's just gross.
[477.08 → 481.78] Some of you, thinking that through, might say, wow, he missed his target.
[483.40 → 484.56] Which I guess he kind of did.
[484.68 → 486.50] I'm sure he wasn't just aiming for the ear.
[486.80 → 488.74] He's probably going for a little bit more down the centre.
[488.74 → 495.00] And I think others might say, well, you know, Peter, don't you get it?
[495.06 → 497.12] Jesus is all about peace and love.
[497.38 → 499.36] So, yeah, of course he's not in on that agenda.
[499.94 → 501.82] But, you know, even that can be misguided.
[502.06 → 505.20] Because we're defining peace and love in a particular way then.
[505.64 → 506.88] And I remember Jesus' words.
[507.22 → 509.18] I have come not to bring peace, but a sword.
[509.30 → 510.80] How does that fit in?
[510.80 → 517.58] Jesus defines how life goes and what's peace and what's love and how that works.
[517.88 → 519.12] So there's a lot going on here.
[519.26 → 520.32] And there's lots of reaction.
[520.82 → 522.30] But I feel for Peter.
[523.78 → 529.08] You know, I can identify with any character in the story to some degree.
[529.20 → 530.62] But Peter may be more particularly.
[531.48 → 533.62] You know, he's really worked up.
[533.80 → 535.12] He's really upset.
[535.34 → 537.08] He's got to do something.
[537.08 → 539.78] You know, Peter goes in.
[539.90 → 542.74] You know, he's the one who stepped out of the boat when there was a storm.
[543.28 → 545.88] And he at least gives a shot at walking on water.
[546.52 → 548.48] It doesn't go particularly well on his own.
[548.56 → 550.74] But he at least goes for it, right?
[550.94 → 552.60] I kind of get that approach.
[553.08 → 555.84] Peter's one who just steps in there, jumps in all in.
[556.48 → 558.62] Even if he's somewhat misguided sometimes.
[558.84 → 560.04] So I do feel for him.
[560.30 → 561.98] I feel like I'm that way too.
[562.10 → 565.16] I want to jump in with the right answer, with the right words.
[565.16 → 567.16] You know, I'm going to fix everything.
[567.30 → 569.92] Just get me to speak, and we'll fix it.
[571.16 → 571.78] Ask my wife.
[571.82 → 572.90] It doesn't always go very well.
[575.32 → 578.20] And Peter is upset.
[578.36 → 578.60] Why?
[579.90 → 583.56] Well, because at the Last Supper, you know, Jesus said to him, said,
[583.64 → 585.26] Peter, you know what you're going to do?
[586.28 → 587.90] You're going to deny me three times.
[588.40 → 590.80] And that must have, you know, just imagine that, you know.
[591.38 → 593.52] You're going to deny me three times.
[593.52 → 596.64] And Peter's going, no, no, no way.
[596.88 → 597.30] No way.
[597.42 → 600.70] I'm, you know, and he comes, he's armed himself with a sword.
[600.84 → 602.60] You know, he's going to show them all.
[603.04 → 603.92] He's going to show them all.
[604.28 → 606.74] You think, there's no way I'm a betrayer.
[608.02 → 609.84] I'm going to die for this guy.
[610.74 → 611.58] I'm all in.
[611.64 → 614.70] I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm swinging away here.
[615.84 → 617.86] And of course, it doesn't go well.
[617.86 → 621.14] And Peter does deny Jesus three times.
[622.66 → 624.14] And that's not the end of the story either.
[624.34 → 627.84] We can look ahead and see that there's redemption for Peter as well.
[629.26 → 633.94] And in this chapter, John has been reminding us the whole time who's in charge.
[636.02 → 638.60] You know, sometimes we want to paint this as a victim story.
[639.46 → 640.20] There's poor Jesus.
[640.76 → 641.96] There's the mighty Roman Empire.
[642.52 → 642.70] Right?
[642.70 → 647.36] You know, poor Jesus, you know, he was just dragged away, false court, you know.
[647.50 → 648.70] Oh, that's kind of true.
[648.84 → 650.32] There's a lot of falsehood going on.
[650.52 → 651.92] A lot of agendas that work.
[653.16 → 655.80] But Jesus is in charge, and John wants us to know that.
[656.24 → 656.42] Right?
[656.54 → 661.78] You know, it struck me this time reading it, you know, where he says, who are you looking for?
[661.90 → 663.50] Oh, we're looking for Jesus of Nazareth.
[663.66 → 664.40] I am he.
[664.64 → 665.70] Oh, I am.
[665.76 → 666.64] That should ring a bell.
[666.96 → 668.72] We have this seven I am, right?
[668.92 → 669.84] I am he.
[669.84 → 673.22] And then it says, they drew back and fell down.
[674.10 → 675.40] What was that?
[677.70 → 680.68] You know, but there's a power that worked there.
[680.94 → 681.80] And it's mysterious.
[682.00 → 684.80] I don't know what's going on there, but what happened there?
[685.12 → 685.28] Right?
[685.34 → 686.34] And I am he.
[686.54 → 688.30] And we're reminded of Jesus.
[688.58 → 689.84] He is the am.
[691.38 → 693.40] I am the vine.
[695.06 → 695.68] Your branches.
[697.28 → 698.06] You want to live?
[698.06 → 698.08] You want to live?
[698.62 → 699.52] Attach to me.
[700.42 → 701.08] That's life.
[702.36 → 703.34] I am the vine.
[703.46 → 704.22] You are the branches.
[705.04 → 706.18] And then verse 9, right?
[706.42 → 711.06] This happened to fulfill the words, I have not lost one that you gave me.
[711.50 → 712.98] This comes up a couple of times.
[713.36 → 714.84] This happened to fulfill.
[715.96 → 719.38] In other words, yeah, yeah, exactly according to plan.
[719.96 → 721.22] This happened to fulfill.
[721.80 → 721.98] Right?
[722.12 → 724.46] And what is Jesus fulfilling here?
[724.54 → 726.78] Well, he's fulfilling his own words out of John 6.
[726.78 → 727.54] Look at it with me.
[728.30 → 732.54] In John 6, Jesus said, for I, and he sets out the whole mission really.
[733.08 → 736.04] He said in John 6, for I have come down from heaven.
[736.18 → 736.96] All right, there's Christmas.
[737.64 → 740.86] Not to do my will, but to do the will of him who sent me.
[740.86 → 749.44] And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up on the last day.
[750.44 → 751.18] That's you too.
[751.80 → 752.80] Raise them up on the last day.
[753.32 → 758.92] For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life.
[759.20 → 761.04] And I'll raise them up on the last day.
[761.04 → 765.38] And he's already referencing that in this particular moment as well.
[767.68 → 770.12] Eternal plan for salvation.
[770.68 → 773.28] So, yeah, Peter, put away that sword.
[773.98 → 774.14] Right?
[774.50 → 779.98] Put away this agenda of trying to prove yourself and your strength and who you are and who you aren't.
[780.18 → 781.40] This is about my mission.
[781.76 → 785.76] I have come to drink the cup the Father gave me.
[785.76 → 793.08] Not some accidental miscarriage of justice the Father gave me to fulfill what pleases him.
[793.62 → 797.84] This is the only way to oneness that I have told you about.
[798.80 → 803.26] There is no other plan that leads to life.
[804.16 → 807.90] And John reminds us again and again and again, Jesus is in charge.
[809.66 → 814.96] I took a it would be a good week to read all the crucifixion stories out of all the gospels.
[814.96 → 818.26] It's, you know, they sometimes emphasize slightly different things here.
[818.68 → 820.04] But Matthew 26, right?
[820.16 → 821.80] Jesus said the same story here.
[822.12 → 825.48] Jesus says to Peter, put your sword back in place, Jesus said to him.
[825.86 → 828.10] For all who draw the sword will die by the sword.
[828.16 → 829.84] That's kind of how the world works.
[830.40 → 836.56] Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will once put at my disposal more than 12 legions of angels?
[836.84 → 836.98] Right?
[837.34 → 839.04] You know, who's in charge here?
[839.30 → 839.82] Jesus is.
[839.82 → 845.96] And then everyone deserts Jesus.
[847.18 → 850.60] Their agenda shifts now to self-preservation.
[851.36 → 852.38] Because they're afraid.
[854.06 → 858.12] Jesus had worked so hard to prepare his followers for his mission to save the world.
[858.42 → 860.10] His mission for a kingdom of oneness.
[860.10 → 860.14] Jesus.
[860.78 → 864.52] And no one, not one, can see it but him.
[865.20 → 872.28] And I am reminded again, humbly, that salvation comes only through Jesus.
[872.28 → 877.36] And I can have all kinds of agendas and all kinds of plans.
[878.14 → 880.38] But God says, here's my way.
[881.14 → 881.70] Follow me.
[884.86 → 887.28] Another agenda that's at work is that of Pilate.
[887.38 → 890.22] I want to kind of finish off by reading about him.
[891.50 → 893.06] John 18, verse 31.
[893.50 → 895.94] And he's speaking, Pilate's speaking here to the Jewish leaders.
[895.94 → 899.52] And Pilate says, you know, take him yourself and judge him by your own laws.
[900.62 → 903.52] But we have no right to execute anyone, they objected.
[904.06 → 905.64] And this took place, here we go again.
[905.96 → 910.68] This took place to fulfill what Jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die.
[911.50 → 920.56] Even the kind of death was part of God's plan for this mission to bring redemption to the world.
[920.56 → 926.96] And Pilate then went back inside his palace and summoned Jesus and asked him, are you the king of the Jews?
[927.68 → 929.34] Is that your own idea, Jesus asked?
[929.54 → 931.34] Or did the others talk to you about me?
[932.24 → 933.02] Am I a Jew?
[933.32 → 933.84] Pilate replied.
[934.30 → 936.50] Your own people and chief priest handed you over to me.
[936.78 → 937.82] What is it you have done?
[939.44 → 942.48] Jesus said, my kingdom is not of this world.
[942.68 → 946.70] If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders.
[946.80 → 948.44] That's kind of how it goes in the world.
[948.44 → 952.04] But now, my kingdom is from another place.
[952.78 → 954.86] Because that kingdom is coming and has come.
[955.48 → 956.90] Well, you're a king then, said Pilate.
[957.60 → 960.00] And Jesus answered, you say that I'm a king?
[960.24 → 965.18] In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth.
[966.38 → 968.92] Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.
[970.02 → 972.12] Well, what is truth, retorted Pilate.
[972.12 → 976.54] And with this he went out and again to the Jews and gathered there.
[976.60 → 978.94] And he said, I find no basis for a charge against him.
[979.32 → 984.08] But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover.
[984.14 → 985.66] Do you want me to release the king of the Jews?
[985.96 → 987.88] And they shouted back, no, no, not him.
[988.02 → 988.46] Give us Barabbas.
[988.46 → 989.02] Barabbas.
[989.02 → 994.10] And now Barabbas had taken a part in an uprising.
[994.30 → 997.50] He was a true rebel in that sense.
[998.66 → 1002.98] And what I want to look at here is that there are two kingdoms at play here.
[1003.56 → 1009.64] And the kingdom of God is fuelled by service and sacrifice rather than power as we define it.
[1009.64 → 1014.38] And throughout the gospels we see this tension between the two kingdoms.
[1014.78 → 1017.38] Ones that we make and God's kingdom.
[1018.02 → 1019.76] And that is still going on.
[1019.84 → 1020.90] That's why I want to talk about this.
[1021.24 → 1024.24] Jesus has been showing people what his kingdom is like.
[1025.36 → 1029.38] Where the last will be first, and the first will be last.
[1030.28 → 1032.46] Where greatness will somehow be about serving.
[1033.18 → 1035.50] Because somehow that brings oneness.
[1035.50 → 1040.14] And this isn't a kingdom we find in this world on our terms.
[1041.50 → 1046.70] You know kingdoms, you know, if we define kingdom, really it's a way of ordering life and getting things done.
[1047.28 → 1050.14] And the kingdoms have values.
[1050.62 → 1052.52] The kingdom of the world values autonomy.
[1052.94 → 1053.68] I'm in charge.
[1053.90 → 1054.88] I take care of myself.
[1055.46 → 1058.56] Fame, power, control, wealth.
[1060.18 → 1065.30] You know, I swim fairly regularly, and I was in the pool the other day.
[1065.30 → 1068.42] And there was this one guy that I was talking to, kind of my age.
[1068.62 → 1071.36] And I think he's a Greek guy.
[1071.88 → 1073.78] And he had a big cross on.
[1074.54 → 1075.94] And I'd seen him a bunch of times.
[1076.04 → 1078.54] So I asked him, I said, you know, what's with the cross?
[1078.78 → 1080.08] And he was immediately annoyed.
[1082.30 → 1084.92] And I thought, oh, okay.
[1085.44 → 1087.82] Anyway, he seemed pretty lighthearted prior to that.
[1087.82 → 1093.56] But he said, I live for me.
[1094.76 → 1095.36] That's all.
[1098.28 → 1098.82] All right.
[1099.68 → 1101.90] I said, well, the cross means a lot to me.
[1102.88 → 1105.58] But it's what Christ has done that it means something to me.
[1105.68 → 1106.72] He said, well, I just live for me.
[1108.16 → 1108.94] I said, that's fine.
[1109.94 → 1111.74] And I'll never talk to him again.
[1111.74 → 1112.12] I'm not going to be sitting on that.
[1116.76 → 1118.24] But it just struck me, right?
[1118.46 → 1119.46] That cross.
[1121.56 → 1126.54] You know, we centre our life around a crucified Saviour.
[1127.78 → 1129.34] Not because we love crucifixion so much.
[1129.38 → 1132.94] But we love that his mission was to bring wholeness and oneness to the world.
[1133.62 → 1134.74] That's what's going on here.
[1135.38 → 1137.40] And so kingdoms have value, right?
[1137.64 → 1138.00] Autonomy.
[1138.00 → 1138.08] Autonomy.
[1138.38 → 1139.66] And I think of that guy.
[1139.80 → 1141.10] I take care of me.
[1141.40 → 1142.18] I define.
[1142.56 → 1143.22] You know, Pilate.
[1143.44 → 1144.52] What is truth?
[1144.82 → 1146.88] You know, we make this stuff up.
[1148.46 → 1150.06] We define truth.
[1151.12 → 1153.12] Sounds a lot like the world we live in, isn't it?
[1154.26 → 1159.22] As opposed to truth being something bigger than us.
[1161.28 → 1161.38] Yeah.
[1164.78 → 1167.26] And then we build these kingdoms.
[1167.26 → 1170.92] And Pilate gets this idea of a kingdom.
[1171.22 → 1173.06] But he gets it on Rome's terms.
[1173.20 → 1174.12] It's about power.
[1174.42 → 1175.16] We define it.
[1175.30 → 1175.98] We bring it.
[1176.06 → 1176.72] With our muscle.
[1176.84 → 1177.44] With our sword.
[1177.64 → 1178.28] With our might.
[1178.76 → 1182.24] We define truth and kingdoms and power.
[1182.56 → 1185.32] And the Pact Roman, the peace of the world.
[1185.82 → 1187.10] Yeah, it's on our terms.
[1187.22 → 1189.14] Listen to us, and you'll have some peace.
[1189.34 → 1191.84] Don't listen to us and, well, there will be more trouble.
[1191.84 → 1195.42] So it wasn't really a peace after all.
[1195.42 → 1198.10] And we build these kingdoms through force, right?
[1198.34 → 1199.64] Like with a sword.
[1199.86 → 1200.98] We see that in Ukraine.
[1202.26 → 1203.14] With manipulation.
[1204.32 → 1205.06] With money.
[1205.22 → 1206.16] We buy our way to the top.
[1206.22 → 1210.92] All kinds of ways we try to build the kingdoms that we think are worth building.
[1211.68 → 1212.78] And the religious leaders, right?
[1212.82 → 1214.40] They showed up with a gang with force.
[1214.90 → 1220.14] And they needed the might and the laws of Rome to get rid of this one man who's messing with their agenda.
[1220.58 → 1224.06] And Jesus says to all of them, Jesus said, you know what?
[1224.06 → 1226.94] Peter, that's not my kingdom, that sword.
[1227.00 → 1228.76] That's not how this is going to go.
[1229.00 → 1231.28] Pilate, that's not the way this is going to go.
[1231.44 → 1233.18] That's not the kingdom that's worth building.
[1233.48 → 1235.32] Judas, that's not the way to go.
[1236.04 → 1237.78] Putin, that's not the way to go.
[1239.70 → 1240.14] Sit.
[1242.68 → 1243.82] With your words.
[1244.36 → 1245.44] All your right answers.
[1247.34 → 1248.38] Taking charge.
[1250.88 → 1252.30] Often it's not the way to go either.
[1254.06 → 1257.30] Just being smarter than everybody else, right?
[1260.00 → 1260.78] It's ironic.
[1260.92 → 1263.82] The kingdom of God is nothing short of a revolution.
[1266.88 → 1268.02] It is a revolution.
[1269.90 → 1274.74] But not like every revolution in history where force over others is the vehicle.
[1275.32 → 1277.76] And where we define truth as we see fit.
[1278.58 → 1281.42] God's kingdom is not of this world.
[1281.52 → 1283.48] Although God's kingdom has come to the world.
[1283.48 → 1284.64] And is coming still.
[1285.34 → 1292.74] And, you know, that's why Jesus said, otherwise, you know, otherwise my father would just fight, you know, like everybody fights.
[1293.16 → 1295.06] But that's not how this is going to work.
[1295.06 → 1301.12] You know, my kingdom, it values serving one another.
[1301.12 → 1308.66] My kingdom values forgiveness and reconciliation.
[1308.66 → 1309.02] And your big opinion.
[1309.02 → 1315.40] So all that nonsense that's going on in your family is counter my kingdom.
[1315.40 → 1322.76] And your big opinion works against the oneness of my kingdom.
[1325.56 → 1328.40] My kingdom values the weak becoming strong.
[1329.30 → 1331.18] My kingdom values humility.
[1332.06 → 1333.92] What does that look like in your life?
[1333.92 → 1340.82] It values seeking God's will over my own because I don't think I'm all that smart, really.
[1342.34 → 1346.34] Always willing to put your interests ahead of my own for your good.
[1346.34 → 1347.34] Not being impressed with myself.
[1347.34 → 1349.50] Not being impressed with myself.
[1349.50 → 1353.20] But being grateful to use my gifts from God to bless others.
[1353.46 → 1354.42] To bless my family.
[1354.72 → 1355.56] To bless my friends.
[1355.84 → 1356.76] To bless my community.
[1357.10 → 1358.72] To bless my enemies.
[1360.16 → 1361.74] Whoever I think they might be.
[1361.74 → 1367.36] Willing to pick up my cross, whatever that is.
[1369.08 → 1369.86] And follow Jesus.
[1372.56 → 1374.12] Because his will.
[1375.20 → 1376.12] And his agenda.
[1376.30 → 1377.18] And his ways.
[1377.80 → 1379.60] Always need to overcome mine.
[1379.60 → 1385.16] Because that is the only way to life and truth and wholeness.
[1385.16 → 1393.08] And somehow.
[1394.20 → 1399.00] That is the path to the oneness that all of us desperately long for.
[1403.60 → 1404.78] And you know.
[1405.38 → 1408.74] You know it's not working deep inside.
[1409.88 → 1412.16] You're always tense, and you're always mad.
[1412.72 → 1413.92] And you're always picking a fight.
[1415.16 → 1416.16] You're always going to be.
[1417.74 → 1418.98] Everybody else is stupid.
[1423.26 → 1424.96] And the oneness of Christ.
[1425.96 → 1427.72] Is what he invites us to.
[1427.82 → 1429.10] It's been the story all along.
[1429.20 → 1430.56] From the garden to the cross.
[1431.68 → 1432.54] And beyond.
[1433.96 → 1435.46] And I think we need to be honest.
[1435.72 → 1437.02] We all get pulled.
[1437.62 → 1439.46] We all get pulled by two kingdoms.
[1439.58 → 1440.32] The kingdom of God.
[1440.66 → 1441.90] And the kingdom of this world.
[1442.52 → 1443.92] Whatever they might be.
[1443.92 → 1447.58] And we see this happening.
[1447.96 → 1449.02] In today's reading.
[1449.24 → 1450.70] As we see it happening in our lives.
[1450.92 → 1451.08] In our.
[1451.50 → 1452.70] In your life and mine.
[1453.44 → 1454.12] And maybe.
[1454.34 → 1455.08] You like me.
[1455.16 → 1456.36] You identify with Peter quite a bit.
[1456.44 → 1458.20] You're caught in the emotions of fear.
[1458.30 → 1458.80] And pride.
[1458.90 → 1459.86] Or some other things.
[1459.90 → 1461.42] You've got some real faith going on too.
[1461.50 → 1462.92] But you battle back and forth.
[1462.92 → 1465.20] And you're always ready for a fight.
[1465.30 → 1466.20] But you fail to realize.
[1466.38 → 1467.20] That the big fight.
[1467.20 → 1469.22] The one that really needs to happen.
[1469.44 → 1470.46] Happens in here.
[1471.82 → 1473.72] Somehow before I enter the fight.
[1473.82 → 1474.70] I need transformation.
[1475.10 → 1476.34] I need some stuff to work on.
[1476.52 → 1478.22] So that I actually know.
[1478.52 → 1479.86] How God wants me to fight.
[1479.86 → 1488.28] And Peter needed to learn that.
[1489.44 → 1490.30] And so do I.
[1491.36 → 1494.20] And surrendering to that work of Jesus in me.
[1494.42 → 1495.94] Is a huge moment.
[1496.98 → 1497.98] A huge moment.
[1498.26 → 1499.40] That I often resist.
[1499.60 → 1501.10] When I think I know better.
[1501.92 → 1503.08] Or when I'm hurt.
[1503.80 → 1504.82] Or when I'm whatever.
[1504.82 → 1505.82] I don't know.
[1507.28 → 1508.32] Maybe some of you say.
[1508.42 → 1509.70] Well I can relate to Judas.
[1509.78 → 1510.44] Or maybe you say.
[1510.50 → 1510.94] Well no, no.
[1511.00 → 1511.28] Wait a minute.
[1512.06 → 1513.62] I'd never betray my friend.
[1513.68 → 1514.44] Not a chance.
[1514.84 → 1515.04] You know.
[1515.06 → 1516.20] I wouldn't be like Jesus.
[1516.50 → 1517.24] Or like Judas rather.
[1517.82 → 1520.08] Yet Judas does give up his friend.
[1520.14 → 1521.48] Who I think he was close to.
[1521.90 → 1525.00] Because Jesus' definition of how it was going to go.
[1525.06 → 1527.46] Didn't fit his definition of how power works.
[1530.54 → 1531.58] Maybe you say.
[1531.62 → 1532.50] I'm not like Judas.
[1532.50 → 1532.72] Well.
[1533.14 → 1534.34] Let me ask you this question.
[1534.82 → 1537.88] Have you ever compromised your relationships.
[1538.50 → 1540.96] Because you see the path forward.
[1541.66 → 1543.08] Better than anyone else.
[1546.06 → 1547.28] Better than anyone else.
[1549.14 → 1550.56] You know what's going on.
[1550.62 → 1551.88] If only they would follow you.
[1551.98 → 1552.78] We'd get somewhere.
[1558.70 → 1560.08] You're right after all.
[1560.42 → 1560.60] Right?
[1560.60 → 1564.96] Or maybe you trust in the world's power.
[1565.28 → 1566.56] More than you realize.
[1566.66 → 1567.64] I mean we do.
[1567.82 → 1568.34] Are told.
[1568.44 → 1569.26] We need to live in the world.
[1569.44 → 1570.24] But not be of it.
[1570.56 → 1571.76] That's a tricky balance.
[1572.02 → 1572.14] Sometimes.
[1572.14 → 1572.58] Isn't it?
[1573.02 → 1573.96] And you know.
[1574.06 → 1575.10] The pilots of the world.
[1575.20 → 1576.42] They represent real power.
[1576.52 → 1576.74] Right?
[1578.94 → 1579.60] I mean man.
[1579.76 → 1579.86] I.
[1580.24 → 1580.70] I got.
[1580.76 → 1581.02] I got.
[1581.12 → 1581.14] I got.
[1581.22 → 1581.26] I got.
[1581.26 → 1581.28] I got.
[1581.28 → 1581.30] I got.
[1581.30 → 1581.34] I got.
[1581.34 → 1581.72] I got.
[1581.84 → 1582.24] My.
[1582.34 → 1583.76] My plan for investments.
[1583.76 → 1584.18] Right?
[1584.18 → 1586.34] I got.
[1586.34 → 1586.90] I got.
[1586.90 → 1587.04] I got.
[1587.04 → 1587.94] I'm not suggesting that.
[1587.94 → 1589.46] You don't have to have some plans in place.
[1589.46 → 1590.58] I'm not suggesting that at all.
[1590.82 → 1593.16] But where are you putting your deep down trust?
[1594.42 → 1597.06] Where are you building your deep down kingdom life?
[1597.98 → 1598.80] What kingdoms.
[1598.96 → 1600.00] Let me ask you this way.
[1600.32 → 1602.64] What kingdoms are you intimate with?
[1606.08 → 1608.04] What kingdoms are you intimate with?
[1608.84 → 1612.76] And the reality is the one kingdom will give you oneness and wholeness and life.
[1612.76 → 1615.52] And the other one will destroy you and leave you empty.
[1615.90 → 1616.90] If not now.
[1617.06 → 1617.80] Down the road.
[1618.10 → 1618.96] But it will happen.
[1619.24 → 1620.60] Just look at Judas' story.
[1620.82 → 1620.88] Right?
[1620.90 → 1621.94] He was all in at one point.
[1622.16 → 1624.76] I think he was a real faithful follower of Jesus at one point.
[1624.80 → 1625.40] I really do.
[1625.80 → 1626.30] I think he would.
[1626.54 → 1626.70] You know.
[1626.72 → 1627.62] They must have trusted him.
[1627.68 → 1628.94] They put him in charge of the money.
[1629.10 → 1629.48] They didn't say.
[1629.72 → 1630.92] Well that guy's always ripping people off.
[1630.98 → 1631.74] Put him in charge of the money.
[1632.12 → 1632.30] You know.
[1632.38 → 1632.84] He's not.
[1632.92 → 1634.12] That's not what's going on here.
[1634.60 → 1634.78] You know.
[1634.78 → 1635.64] Judas is not the.
[1636.32 → 1637.96] We want to demonize Judas all the time.
[1638.92 → 1639.84] He was a follower.
[1640.96 → 1642.62] Who got caught up in his own agenda.
[1642.62 → 1643.46] And couldn't see Jesus.
[1643.56 → 1645.06] And thought he would figure it out himself there.
[1645.08 → 1646.00] And it didn't go well.
[1646.26 → 1646.86] And in the end.
[1646.98 → 1648.44] He couldn't even accept grace.
[1650.40 → 1652.62] He did nothing worse than Peter.
[1655.86 → 1657.10] And yet there was a path forward.
[1657.50 → 1659.26] Peter found a way to surrender.
[1659.82 → 1661.42] Back to the love of the kingdom.
[1661.42 → 1662.74] And the oneness.
[1662.96 → 1664.36] And Judas couldn't.
[1665.64 → 1666.52] And in the end.
[1666.92 → 1668.46] Judas' trust in his own agenda.
[1668.88 → 1669.62] Led him to death.
[1669.86 → 1671.06] Inside and out.
[1671.06 → 1677.72] And then you'll end up believing so many lies.
[1677.96 → 1680.38] And you're going to pretend that those lies are truth.
[1680.44 → 1682.42] So much so that eventually you'll probably think they're truth.
[1683.70 → 1684.46] And they're not.
[1684.54 → 1685.16] They're still lies.
[1685.22 → 1686.48] But you've convinced yourself somehow.
[1687.00 → 1688.52] And in the back of our minds.
[1688.66 → 1690.26] We need to hear Jesus say.
[1690.70 → 1692.12] I am the way.
[1692.60 → 1693.92] I am the truth.
[1694.26 → 1695.58] I am the life.
[1695.58 → 1698.20] And we need to hear Jesus say.
[1698.50 → 1699.84] I am the vine.
[1700.92 → 1701.36] You.
[1702.20 → 1702.82] Are branches.
[1704.32 → 1706.76] And if you're not connected to me.
[1707.02 → 1708.38] Then you won't have life.
[1708.52 → 1711.20] And you'll just be a dead branch.
[1715.74 → 1717.18] Because apart from me.
[1718.04 → 1719.18] You can do.
[1720.70 → 1721.18] Nothing.
[1723.48 → 1724.68] Nothing that brings life.
[1725.58 → 1726.06] Nothing.
[1728.46 → 1729.66] Would you take out.
[1730.68 → 1732.08] The rock that you got.
[1735.44 → 1736.44] When you came in.
[1739.22 → 1740.68] And if some of you are saying.
[1740.76 → 1740.86] Hey.
[1741.04 → 1744.06] I didn't think you were serious about that rock.
[1746.86 → 1748.36] There are other ones here.
[1748.36 → 1752.12] and unlike what Dave said
[1752.12 → 1753.14] that these might be needed
[1753.14 → 1754.26] for at the end of the service
[1754.26 → 1755.72] that I went too long on
[1755.72 → 1758.02] we are not going to do
[1758.02 → 1759.52] an Old Testament stoning right now
[1759.52 → 1764.48] my grandson says darn
[1764.48 → 1768.62] I want this rock
[1768.62 → 1770.18] to be you
[1770.18 → 1773.34] and all the agendas you hold
[1773.34 → 1776.24] the opinions
[1776.24 → 1780.16] that are false agendas
[1780.16 → 1782.42] false ways of thinking
[1782.42 → 1784.44] how you are going to find life
[1784.44 → 1785.78] whatever that might be
[1785.78 → 1787.58] things that don't bring you life
[1787.58 → 1790.36] we act like they bring life
[1790.36 → 1791.38] but they don't
[1791.38 → 1793.50] think about that for a moment
[1793.50 → 1795.10] think of something specific
[1795.10 → 1797.24] how do you attempt
[1797.24 → 1799.96] to find life in places
[1799.96 → 1801.62] where you get no life
[1801.62 → 1804.60] maybe it's trust
[1804.60 → 1805.72] and resources and money
[1805.72 → 1806.40] maybe it's trust
[1806.40 → 1807.24] in your own strength
[1807.24 → 1808.24] maybe it's
[1808.24 → 1810.14] some kind of
[1810.14 → 1812.02] trust in your own brilliance
[1812.02 → 1813.10] whatever it might be
[1813.10 → 1815.06] and then
[1815.06 → 1818.04] I want you to stand
[1818.04 → 1819.16] we're going to stand
[1819.16 → 1819.92] with Simon
[1819.92 → 1821.64] whose name
[1821.64 → 1822.74] is changed to Peter
[1822.74 → 1824.40] he stands as Simon
[1824.40 → 1825.00] you stand
[1825.00 → 1825.90] your name
[1825.90 → 1826.80] and I want
[1826.80 → 1827.76] and then Jesus
[1827.76 → 1829.06] renames Peter
[1829.06 → 1830.14] and in a sense
[1830.14 → 1831.72] he renames all of us
[1831.72 → 1832.94] Rock
[1832.94 → 1835.04] Rock
[1835.04 → 1835.06] Rock
[1835.06 → 1836.26] why do I say that
[1836.26 → 1838.52] because he says to Peter
[1838.52 → 1839.40] he says
[1839.40 → 1840.14] to Simon
[1840.14 → 1840.54] he says
[1840.54 → 1842.00] I name you Peter
[1842.00 → 1843.28] and on you
[1843.28 → 1845.08] which means rock
[1845.08 → 1845.64] and on you
[1845.64 → 1847.58] I will build my church
[1847.58 → 1849.42] and the gates of hell
[1849.42 → 1850.82] will not prevail
[1850.82 → 1853.12] nothing will prevail
[1853.12 → 1855.96] because you are named
[1855.96 → 1856.78] Rock
[1856.78 → 1862.36] and Jesus
[1862.36 → 1863.62] said that
[1863.62 → 1864.72] of that betrayer
[1864.72 → 1865.86] of that denier
[1865.86 → 1867.06] of that sword swinger
[1867.06 → 1867.88] right
[1867.88 → 1868.72] who often trusted
[1868.72 → 1869.46] his own strength
[1869.46 → 1870.30] and he said
[1870.30 → 1870.98] you
[1870.98 → 1872.00] are
[1872.00 → 1873.14] the rock
[1873.14 → 1874.84] and I'm going to
[1874.84 → 1875.58] build a church
[1875.58 → 1876.46] on you
[1876.46 → 1877.02] and others
[1877.02 → 1877.86] like you
[1877.86 → 1880.04] that's the power
[1880.04 → 1880.80] of God's kingdom
[1880.80 → 1882.88] and then
[1882.88 → 1883.68] Jesus takes
[1883.68 → 1885.06] our lives
[1885.06 → 1886.00] and our false agendas
[1886.00 → 1886.82] that lead to death
[1886.82 → 1888.10] and he replaces him
[1888.10 → 1889.30] with life in his name
[1889.30 → 1890.22] and truth in him
[1890.22 → 1892.12] a life that enters us
[1892.12 → 1893.04] and transforms us
[1893.04 → 1893.98] so that we can live
[1893.98 → 1895.00] according to his will
[1895.00 → 1906.60] king
[1906.60 → 1911.60] to
[1911.60 → 1912.46] speak
[1912.46 → 1914.52] me
[1914.52 → 1915.10] to
[1916.16 → 1916.68] emphasis
