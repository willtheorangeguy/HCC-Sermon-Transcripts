[0.00 --> 4.24]  are going to continue our series in the Gospel of John. Some of you thought we were starting
[4.24 --> 7.46]  a new series, but we actually are going to stay there because John has more to say to
[7.46 --> 12.40]  us about what Jesus does and teaches after his resurrection. And so if you have your
[12.40 --> 16.80]  Bible, turn with me to John 20. We're going to pick right up where we left last week in
[16.80 --> 19.68]  verse 11. John 20, verse 11.
[19.68 --> 31.30]  Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look in the tomb,
[31.58 --> 36.74]  and she saw two angels in white seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the
[36.74 --> 43.68]  other at the foot. They asked her, Woman, why are you crying? They've taken my Lord away,
[43.68 --> 49.02]  she said, and I don't know where they put him. At this she turned around and saw Jesus standing
[49.02 --> 54.82]  there, but she didn't recognize that it was Jesus. He asked her, Woman, why are you crying?
[55.00 --> 60.70]  Who is it that you're looking for? Thinking he was the gardener, she said, Sir, if you
[60.70 --> 65.64]  have carried him away, tell me where that you have put him, and I will get him. Jesus said
[65.64 --> 73.56]  to her, Mary. She turned towards him and cried out in Aramaic, Rabboni, which means teacher.
[74.86 --> 78.58]  Jesus said, Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father.
[79.02 --> 84.68]  Go instead to my brothers and tell them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father,
[84.80 --> 90.48]  to my God and your God. Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news, I have seen the Lord,
[91.16 --> 96.36]  as she told them that he had said these things to her. On the evening of that first day of the week,
[96.36 --> 100.94]  when the disciples were gathered together with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders,
[101.58 --> 108.30]  Jesus came, stood among them, and said, Peace be with you. After he said this, he showed them his
[108.30 --> 113.74]  hands and his side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord, and again Jesus said,
[114.30 --> 121.70]  Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, I am sending you. And with that, he breathed on them
[121.70 --> 126.94]  and said, Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of anyone, their sins are forgiven. If you
[126.94 --> 133.12]  do not forgive them, they are not forgiven. Now, Thomas, also known as Didymus, one of the twelve,
[133.12 --> 138.28]  was not with the disciples when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, We've seen the Lord.
[139.08 --> 145.02]  But he said to them, Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were
[145.02 --> 152.30]  and put my hand into the side, I will not believe. A week later, his disciples were in the house again,
[152.38 --> 156.92]  and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said,
[156.92 --> 166.10]  Peace be with you. Then he said to Thomas, Put your finger here. See my hands. Reach your hand out
[166.10 --> 175.88]  and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe. Thomas said to him, My Lord and my God. Then Jesus
[175.88 --> 182.24]  told him, Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believed.
[182.24 --> 193.82]  One of the realities we all face in life is that the reality that our relationships with people will
[193.82 --> 199.12]  change over time. That is inevitable. Let me give you three situations that I think many of us will
[199.12 --> 207.48]  have experienced already. Situation number one, you have a childhood buddy. You went to school together,
[207.76 --> 211.60]  you were in after-school programs together, you took all your classes together, and then after school
[211.60 --> 218.60]  was all done and finished, your friend moved away, and that relationship shifted. Or how about this
[218.60 --> 223.86]  situation? You've got a best friend. You spend endless hours together on weekends. You always find each
[223.86 --> 230.50]  other at your house, and yet all of a sudden, this new boy comes into the circle, and all of a sudden,
[230.58 --> 235.70]  you get engaged and married, and this friend in you, you've got to recalibrate this relationship now
[235.70 --> 241.76]  that there's a boy in the picture, and this new husband who's vying for time. Situation number three,
[242.00 --> 246.28]  you've got a daughter or a son, they move off to university, they're gone for four or five years,
[246.50 --> 250.88]  and then after it's all said and done, they move back home. And they're not a kid anymore.
[251.64 --> 257.76]  They're all grown up. And you have to recalibrate that relationship with this new adult. And perhaps
[257.76 --> 265.04]  for the first time, you can charge rent to that adult. In all of these situations, something new
[265.04 --> 270.32]  has happened. You can't go back to the way the relationship was. You can't change the way things
[270.32 --> 275.06]  have changed. There's a new moment, and there's a way in which you have to reshape the dynamics of
[275.06 --> 281.12]  that relationship. That's what John is telling us is happening with Jesus and his disciples.
[281.12 --> 287.96]  His disciples don't know it yet, but everything has changed. Jesus has gone to the grave. He has
[287.96 --> 292.46]  come back in his resurrected body, and they don't know it yet, but they're stepping in a whole new
[292.46 --> 299.28]  moment, a whole new era in history. And what they also don't know is Jesus is actually not going to
[299.28 --> 306.18]  stick around for long. He's going away to be with the Father in his resurrected body to rule over creation.
[306.98 --> 310.14]  And they're going to receive his Spirit. They're going to be full of his life, and they're going to
[310.14 --> 314.64]  relate to him in a whole different way, but it's not going back. He's not going to be with them on
[314.64 --> 318.40]  the side of the hill teaching the crowds. He's not going to be going from home to home in Galilee
[318.40 --> 322.70]  and Jerusalem. It's a whole new moment, and he's preparing them for that change.
[324.36 --> 329.54]  One of the things I love about John 20, especially these three appearances, is how incredibly
[329.54 --> 334.72]  relational Jesus is. I mean, think of all the things he could be doing after his resurrection,
[334.88 --> 339.38]  all the people he could be sharing with, but he goes very personally to the people he loves
[339.38 --> 345.20]  deeply. And not only that, he comes to the place of need. There are three sections of
[345.20 --> 349.64]  this passage. Jesus appears to Mary, then he appears to his disciples, then he appears
[349.64 --> 355.24]  to Thomas. And in each of those appearances, he goes right to the place of their deepest
[355.24 --> 360.90]  struggle, right to the place of their greatest needs, and he does his ministry. He ministers
[360.90 --> 367.10]  to Mary in her grief. He ministers to the disciples in their fear. And he ministers to Thomas
[367.10 --> 373.00]  in his doubt. And in each case, he overcomes that pain, that struggle, and draws them into
[373.00 --> 379.70]  faith and trust as they step into this new moment of ministry. Let's take a look at this
[379.70 --> 387.70]  passage together. The very first person who sees Jesus in his resurrected body is Mary.
[388.18 --> 392.78]  The same Mary who ran and saw the tombstone had rolled away, told the disciples, she's now
[392.78 --> 397.88]  back at the tomb. And I just think John tells the story masterfully, right? She looks in
[397.88 --> 401.30]  the tomb, she sees two angels. Whether or not she knows they're angels, we do not know.
[401.56 --> 405.98]  She turns around and sees a gardener who is not the gardener. And the gardener says, Mary,
[406.06 --> 410.74]  who are you looking for? Why are you crying? And she says to him, I'm looking for Jesus.
[410.94 --> 414.70]  They've taken away his body. If you've taken the body, tell me, I'll go get him. I mean,
[414.70 --> 424.70]  this woman, she means business. And then this gardener says, Mary. And right there, it all clicks.
[425.24 --> 430.98]  That's the voice of Jesus. That's the body of Jesus. That is the Savior Jesus out from the tomb,
[431.34 --> 435.76]  standing right in front of her. And I agree with those who say she probably ran to him and she
[435.76 --> 439.88]  threw her arms around him and embraced her resurrected Savior in the flesh.
[439.88 --> 448.06]  what's the first thing Jesus says to her? It's almost strange. And you can see he's already
[448.06 --> 453.86]  starting to help her shift that relationship. It's not like it was. He says, Mary, don't hold
[453.86 --> 460.64]  on to me. Isn't that strange? He says, Mary, I'm going to ascend to the Father. And I haven't done that
[460.64 --> 465.60]  yet. So your job now is to go tell my brothers, tell them that I'm going to be with the Father.
[465.60 --> 470.84]  That's your new job. And I'm sure Mary at that point was confused, but she was comforted.
[471.78 --> 477.22]  Her grief had turned to joy because the Jesus that she was weeping over, thinking the tomb was empty
[477.22 --> 481.18]  because the body was stolen, is now the Jesus standing in front of her saying, go tell others.
[482.64 --> 488.70]  Now we get to scene two. Jesus is now appearing to his disciples. And what a scene this is, hey?
[489.28 --> 494.30]  These are 12 people who followed him, they loved him, and now they are huddled in a room with a door
[494.30 --> 499.36]  locked out of fear of what the Jewish leaders might do to them now that they crucified their leader.
[500.06 --> 505.62]  There's a very palpable sense of fear. And in that scene, you can imagine how they talk,
[505.70 --> 509.02]  what their fears are even for their future. Do they go back to their old jobs? Sid's going to
[509.02 --> 513.40]  preach on that next week. Jesus shows up right in their midst, and what's his first words?
[515.08 --> 521.46]  Peace be with you. And that's one of those loaded biblical words. Peace means not just the absence
[521.46 --> 528.76]  of conflict, but it is the full presence of Christ. It's the shalom of God, the harmony that we are
[528.76 --> 533.66]  created to have from the beginning. The first gift that Jesus gives after he goes to the grave,
[533.78 --> 539.12]  rises victorious over sin and death, he says to his disciples, peace, it's yours.
[540.86 --> 547.32]  And they move from a place of deep fear to overjoyed. They join Mary in faith,
[547.32 --> 554.50]  and seeing the resurrected Lord, they're full of joy. Listen now to how Jesus also prepares them for
[554.50 --> 558.62]  the change of relationship. He doesn't talk about his ascension. He talks about what it means for
[558.62 --> 566.34]  them. He says in verse 21, peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, I am sending you. And with
[566.34 --> 573.82]  that, he breathed on them and said, receive the Holy Spirit. Just as the Father gave Jesus a particular job
[573.82 --> 579.46]  that he went to the world with. So Jesus is now saying to all followers, I give you a particular
[579.46 --> 585.98]  job. And that job is nothing less than letting the world know what he just accomplished.
[587.10 --> 593.00]  Think of this moment in history they're in. Nobody knows that Jesus rose from the dead.
[593.46 --> 599.06]  Nobody is aware, not just that it happened, but what it means. And what we see Jesus saying in the end
[599.06 --> 604.16]  of Matthew and the rest of the New Testament writers, the job of the church as Jesus ascends
[604.16 --> 610.22]  to the Father is to make it known, to spread the news of peace, to tell people that the victory has
[610.22 --> 615.34]  been won, sin has been conquered, creation has been reclaimed by the Father through the work of the Son,
[615.76 --> 620.50]  share it with the world. Nobody knows. And as we were just talking about with our kids,
[620.58 --> 624.78]  the reason Jesus hasn't come back is because there are many people who still haven't heard.
[624.78 --> 632.20]  That's why Amy's going to the Middle East. But what does Jesus do next? Well, he gives them the
[632.20 --> 638.88]  very thing they need to do what he's calling them to do. He's aware that Israel was sent to bear witness
[638.88 --> 643.76]  to the goodness of God and it was a failure. So what's the decisive difference? Jesus gives them
[643.76 --> 651.84]  the Spirit. He pours out on them the same power that rose them from the dead. And there's this very
[651.84 --> 655.68]  fascinating scene. I think it's one of the most intriguing scenes of this whole passage where Jesus
[655.68 --> 659.08]  breathes on them. I mean, can you imagine that? He's like,
[659.48 --> 665.24]  it's a strange scene. And I couldn't help but do some reading on it because it's just intriguing to
[665.24 --> 670.46]  me. And I realize as Leslie Newbigin, one of the commentators, points out, this is another way where
[670.46 --> 677.08]  John brings the story right back to Genesis. Genesis 1 is God creating this beautiful, varied,
[677.08 --> 682.74]  creative, stunning world. Genesis 2, he's placing humanity into the world. And before Adam even does
[682.74 --> 688.22]  anything in the world, we're told in Genesis 2-7 that God takes Adam and he breathes into Adam
[688.22 --> 697.60]  the breath of life. And then it says, and he became a living being. Now Jesus, full of the life of God,
[697.80 --> 703.80]  resurrected Son of God, is with his closest disciples and he's breathing on them the life of God.
[703.80 --> 711.86]  God, and they become living beings. Isn't that beautiful? The church, as it receives the Spirit,
[711.94 --> 717.06]  this includes us, the moment we believe, we become alive. And not just in any kind of life like
[717.06 --> 723.20]  breathing, but full of the resurrection life of the Holy Spirit. Jesus breathes on them.
[724.24 --> 727.22]  And we're going to come back to this in a minute. He's not worried about their mission. He's not worried
[727.22 --> 731.48]  about how bad they're failing. He's not worried about their fear because they have his living power.
[731.48 --> 737.10]  Not just near them, not around them. Abiding, resting, transforming inside them.
[739.96 --> 747.98]  Now we get to scene three. Scene three is Jesus appearing to Thomas, doubting Thomas, right? You
[747.98 --> 752.92]  can't say Thomas without saying doubting Thomas. And I love that John includes this in his gospel
[752.92 --> 756.18]  account. I mean, so many things Jesus did were not recorded. John even tells us that himself,
[756.18 --> 761.80]  but he records this, right? Thomas was not there when Jesus appeared to the other 10. Thomas was
[761.80 --> 766.72]  not part of the original sort of receiving of the peace. And Jesus knows that. And Thomas' disciples,
[766.86 --> 773.58]  sort of his friends, they even said to him, Thomas, we've seen the Lord. But Thomas is rigid and honest
[773.58 --> 778.48]  about his doubt. Listen to what Thomas says here. Unless I see the nail marks in his hands,
[778.48 --> 785.54]  put my finger where the nails were, that's a bit morbid, I'd probably faint, and put my hand into
[785.54 --> 792.10]  his side, I will not believe. And you know, you can be critical of Thomas here, but I just want to say,
[792.22 --> 797.40]  I commend his honesty. Here's a guy who's not going to say, hey, this is an easy thing to believe.
[797.98 --> 802.52]  Thomas is not going to sort of like betray his own emotional state, his own sense of mind of what's
[802.52 --> 806.14]  reasonable, what can be done. He's saying, no, I just, if I'm going to believe something this
[806.14 --> 814.44]  monumental, I have to see it. And guess who knows that more than anybody? Jesus. And so Jesus makes
[814.44 --> 818.74]  a separate appearance to his disciples just for Thomas. So he goes over to Thomas when he's with
[818.74 --> 823.22]  the disciples and he gives them what he already gave the others is peace. And then Jesus says,
[823.30 --> 829.86]  Thomas, I want you to do exactly what you need. I want you to touch my hand and see the hole where
[829.86 --> 835.06]  the nail was. I want you to touch my side and see where I was pierced with a spear.
[836.22 --> 842.98]  Stop doubting Thomas and believe it's me. And Thomas does that. Can you just imagine that scene?
[843.68 --> 848.02]  And the summary of Thomas moving from doubt to faith is one sentence where he says, looking at
[848.02 --> 855.06]  Jesus, my Lord, my God. That's who you are, Jesus. You're my Lord and you're my God. And in that moment,
[855.06 --> 859.68]  he joins John, he joins Peter, he joins Mary, he joins the disciples in believing.
[859.86 --> 864.84]  That this is the resurrected Jesus, Lord and Savior, conqueror of sin and death,
[865.18 --> 873.58]  standing right in front of him. He believes. Notice with me that there is a verse in this
[873.58 --> 878.18]  passage at the very end that's actually directed to us. Did you see it? Did you notice the verse?
[878.74 --> 883.64]  Let me read how this whole passage finishes. Jesus says to Thomas, because you have seen me,
[883.64 --> 890.76]  you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe. That's for us.
[891.82 --> 898.48]  Just pause with me and marvel for one moment. Here we are, 2022, thousands of years removed from the
[898.48 --> 902.88]  event of what we're describing here, of Jesus' death and resurrection. We are thousands of kilometers
[902.88 --> 909.24]  removed from Jerusalem where this whole event is taking place. And here we are, gathering in Jesus' name
[909.24 --> 915.46]  to exalt him for who he is, praise the Father for what he has accomplished, and live and experience
[915.46 --> 921.02]  the life of the Holy Spirit here in British Columbia. That's amazing. And we're not the only
[921.02 --> 924.92]  church doing that right now. The church is all over our city, all over our country. They're gathering
[924.92 --> 932.06]  in Jesus' name. Have we seen Jesus? No, we haven't. Do we believe in him? Yes, we do. And Jesus says,
[932.06 --> 938.60]  receive this. He says to every one of us, blessed are you. You didn't have to do what Thomas did.
[939.28 --> 943.10]  And you received my Spirit. You received my blessing. Just receive that this morning.
[943.34 --> 947.92]  That's his blessing for all of us, just by believing in his name without needing the evidence.
[954.50 --> 957.08]  In this passage, Jesus makes a point
[957.08 --> 962.14]  of appearing to all of his disciples and meeting them in their moment of need.
[963.20 --> 969.98]  He sees Mary's grief, and he ministers to her. He sees his disciples' deep-seated fear for their
[969.98 --> 974.52]  lives, and he ministers to them. He sees Thomas' doubt, and he ministers to him. And here's the
[974.52 --> 979.80]  simple point I want to make this morning. You ready for it? Jesus has not changed.
[981.38 --> 985.96]  When Jesus ascended to be with the Father, and he took up his rightful place as Lord over all creation,
[985.96 --> 992.30]  he did not stop caring about his disciples. And that is to say, he cares just as much for your
[992.30 --> 997.60]  grief as he does for Mary's. He cares just as much for your fear as he does for the disciples. He cares
[997.60 --> 1004.32]  just as much about your doubt as he does for Thomas. Do you believe that? I think we have this insidious
[1004.32 --> 1007.60]  lie in the church that there's something about Jesus we read here that's not true about him in
[1007.60 --> 1013.90]  present tense. Jesus in present tense still has his body, and he hasn't changed. And he cares just as
[1013.90 --> 1017.28]  deeply about the needs of his believers, the needs of his followers, the needs of his church,
[1017.70 --> 1024.18]  as he did then. So that is to say that Jesus cares just as much about your grief as Mary's,
[1024.24 --> 1028.88]  and he ministers to our grief in the same way he ministers to Mary's. Let me give you an example.
[1029.80 --> 1033.94]  Last Sunday, right after preaching on Resurrection Sunday, my favorite Sunday to preach,
[1034.36 --> 1038.90]  saying the same thing every year, Jesus rose from the dead. Right after the service, I go up to a guy
[1038.90 --> 1043.30]  named Paul. He's in our church. He's in the 9 a.m. service. And Paul, two weeks ago, lost his wife.
[1043.80 --> 1047.90]  Kind of a strange first person to talk to after you preach on Resurrection Sunday, right? And
[1047.90 --> 1052.66]  thankfully, Paul did all the talking. And right away, he starts sharing with me how he's so thankful
[1052.66 --> 1057.44]  Candace, who loved the Lord, is in the presence of Jesus. He thanked me for all the prayers that are
[1057.44 --> 1060.98]  taking place in the church for him and his family as they go through this process of living life,
[1061.20 --> 1066.20]  knowing she's not with him anymore. And Paul starts ministering to me about the hope of the
[1066.20 --> 1070.72]  resurrection. He starts ministering to me about the comfort of knowing Jesus and how Candace no
[1070.72 --> 1075.48]  longer suffers, is no longer in pain, and she knows Christ, her Lord and Savior, face to face.
[1076.52 --> 1080.00]  Praise the Lord that Paul's there. And what he's doing is showing me exactly what I'm saying,
[1080.40 --> 1086.88]  that Jesus is just as concerned about Paul's grief and yours as he is about Mary's. That's who Jesus is.
[1086.92 --> 1093.26]  He has not changed. Jesus is just concerned about your fear as he is for the disciples.
[1093.26 --> 1099.94]  You know, the great fear they had is not just death. The fear they had was also being associated
[1099.94 --> 1105.08]  with Jesus. There's a new dangerous reality around them that if they were to proclaim Jesus,
[1105.20 --> 1110.34]  they were to proclaim that he died and rose. There is threats. There's risks, all sorts of risks that
[1110.34 --> 1115.90]  we read about in other books in the New Testament. Let me ask you the question, is that not still true
[1115.90 --> 1123.40]  today? Is it not true to say of our church here, there is within us a great deal of fear about
[1123.40 --> 1129.04]  speaking and living and acknowledging the name of Jesus in our city today? You know, I've been at our
[1129.04 --> 1133.42]  church long enough to know that there are many of us who have a deep fear, not just a little fear,
[1133.50 --> 1140.02]  but a big fear, to speak to our co-workers our love for Christ. To say to our neighbors,
[1140.02 --> 1146.20]  hey, where were you on Sunday morning? I was at church, right? There's that sense of like,
[1146.26 --> 1150.84]  what will they think of me? What will they do about that knowledge? Will it break the relationship?
[1150.98 --> 1156.02]  Could it threaten my job? I know several people in our church for whom to speak honestly and openly
[1156.02 --> 1160.42]  about Jesus as Lord and Savior, the resurrected King, that could undermine their position.
[1161.10 --> 1165.52]  That could threaten their job. There's a real fear in the church, in this church.
[1165.52 --> 1172.72]  But here's the good news. I know so many stories of people in our church who have allowed Christ to
[1172.72 --> 1180.24]  minister to them in that specific fear. In our Surge Discipleship group, we spend a lot of time naming
[1180.24 --> 1184.30]  that, talking about evangelism, our fear of it, what's going on with us, why it's such a big deal
[1184.30 --> 1191.90]  for us. And I've seen so many people take those baby steps of faith and allow Christ by the power of
[1191.90 --> 1199.76]  the Holy Spirit to enable them to speak honestly, openly, ordinarily in their daily life about why
[1199.76 --> 1205.58]  they love Jesus. And it starts off with saying, hey, I do go to church on Sunday. Hey, I am part of
[1205.58 --> 1211.72]  Hope Community Church. Hey, I do believe this because it's life. You should come. And there's a sense in
[1211.72 --> 1216.46]  which I finally can acknowledge the deepest part of me that makes sense of the whole of my life.
[1216.46 --> 1222.78]  Jesus ministers to us in that fear. Do you believe that? And I know a number of you, you've gone
[1222.78 --> 1227.10]  through Surge and not even those of you who haven't, you've seen this. If we allow Christ to
[1227.10 --> 1230.78]  minister to us in that fear, watch out what he can do in and through ordinary believers.
[1232.26 --> 1240.14]  Thirdly, Jesus cares just as much about our doubt as he did Thomas'. He made a special appearance just
[1240.14 --> 1244.48]  for Thomas. Think about that. He cared so much for Thomas' faith that he shows up and said, hey,
[1244.48 --> 1251.50]  touch my body, see my hand, believe it. He still has that same sense of concern for our doubts. And I
[1251.50 --> 1255.92]  want to say, if you're someone who goes through doubt, which is a very normal thing in a society that
[1255.92 --> 1260.18]  does not acknowledge any of the supernatural, that does not acknowledge the presence of God in any real
[1260.18 --> 1266.92]  meaningful way, know that you're in good company with many people in the Scriptures. As someone who
[1266.92 --> 1273.74]  struggles to believe, you are in good company with Abraham, who constantly doubted God. You're in good
[1273.74 --> 1277.18]  company with David, who never really seemed to come to believe that God was going to win the
[1277.18 --> 1282.10]  victories for him. You're in good company with Gideon, with Thomas, with John, so many of the
[1282.10 --> 1286.86]  disciples who stumbled to actually say Jesus will do what he said he's going to do. Jesus is who he
[1286.86 --> 1291.08]  says he is. This world is the way Jesus describes it to be. You're in good company.
[1291.08 --> 1297.92]  I mean, think about this. Martin Luther, sort of the great reformer of the church,
[1298.76 --> 1302.96]  described his prayer life this way. He says, sometimes when I pray, I feel this great wall
[1302.96 --> 1309.26]  of indifference. Mother Teresa, whose journal was discovered after her death, I'll just read for you
[1309.26 --> 1313.74]  a quote from her journal. This is Mother Teresa. She said, I feel this terrible pain of loss,
[1313.74 --> 1319.74]  God not wanting me, God not being God, God not really existing. Mother Teresa.
[1321.44 --> 1326.10]  And I think we need to realize that God meets us and ministers to us in very particular and
[1326.10 --> 1331.12]  powerful ways in seasons of doubt. One of those, if I can say anecdotally from my experience in our
[1331.12 --> 1337.18]  churches, he meets us through a community of faith. People who carry us when we feel empty. People who
[1337.18 --> 1341.34]  pray with us when we don't feel we can pray. People who speak words of faith when we don't feel those
[1341.34 --> 1346.58]  words within our own guts. And through a variety of ways, and some of you know this, through a
[1346.58 --> 1355.20]  variety of ways, God's bring us not to a place of certainty, but a place of trust. And I do think
[1355.20 --> 1358.68]  that is a difference. God does not say, I'm going to answer every question you have. And the Bible has
[1358.68 --> 1363.98]  an answer to every specific scientific fact you want about the Scriptures. But he does bring us to
[1363.98 --> 1371.34]  a place of saying, I can trust him. I can follow him. He's good.
[1375.28 --> 1378.82]  I'm going to finish with some good news this morning. My favorite part of the passage, I think
[1378.82 --> 1382.40]  I said that three times already. I have a lot of favorite parts of this passage. My favorite part
[1382.40 --> 1387.66]  of the passage is as Jesus prepares them for his ascension, as he's going away, I know they were so
[1387.66 --> 1392.96]  confused. There's a sense of which he just got here, and now he's leaving. And there's a piece of me
[1392.96 --> 1398.22]  that thinks, I bet in the back of their minds, they were thinking, if Jesus wants the world to
[1398.22 --> 1402.70]  know that he rose from the dead, that he's conquered sin, that the creation has been reclaimed,
[1403.02 --> 1409.38]  why doesn't he stick around and tell people himself? It's a fair question. Why doesn't Jesus
[1409.38 --> 1414.94]  sort of advocate for himself? And yet Jesus isn't worried. He's not concerned about where things are
[1414.94 --> 1420.20]  going now that he's ascending to the Father and pouring out his Spirit. Jesus is not anxious about
[1420.20 --> 1425.16]  where the future is going. He's not anxious about this little group of struggling new believers
[1425.16 --> 1431.40]  to carry forth the message into the world. Isn't that amazing? Jesus is not worried about where
[1431.40 --> 1438.36]  things are going. And one of the main reasons for that is he knows that he's going to the Father's
[1438.36 --> 1444.70]  right hand, and the Father loves this world, and it belongs to him. He knows that he has these marks
[1444.70 --> 1449.90]  in his hand and this mark on his side, the very marks that prove he defeated the greatest enemy
[1449.90 --> 1457.04]  of all, sin and death. And he knows that he's going to take his rightful rule over the creation.
[1457.38 --> 1462.84]  All things, as Paul says, are now under Jesus' feet. It's going to be taken care of. And finally,
[1463.26 --> 1468.90]  Jesus knows that his disciples are not left into their own devices. They get the power and the presence
[1468.90 --> 1478.70]  and the love of the Spirit until he comes again. And I just want to say, praise the Lord that this
[1478.70 --> 1483.66]  whole mission we have to bring the good news to the nations is not dependent on human strength.
[1484.42 --> 1489.88]  Praise the Lord for that. Praise the Lord that evangelism doesn't depend on human eloquence of
[1489.88 --> 1495.50]  speech. We'd be in real trouble, wouldn't we? Praise the Lord that the future of our church and all
[1495.50 --> 1500.60]  churches rest not in my hands or your hands, but the very hands that have the holes that say,
[1500.94 --> 1508.62]  I've won the battle. Praise the Lord that the church belongs to God, and it has Jesus on the
[1508.62 --> 1515.92]  throne who says, I'm coming again. The future is secure. This is the same Jesus who takes a pretty
[1515.92 --> 1520.90]  ragtag bunch of ordinary people and says, I will minister to you in your grief. I will minister to
[1520.90 --> 1525.92]  you in your fear. I will minister to you in your doubt, and I will send you in my power and all
[1525.92 --> 1532.30]  your ordinary brokenness to make the gospel of Jesus known here in BC and all over the globe.
[1532.72 --> 1534.82]  Praise the Lord. Let's pray.
[1541.16 --> 1547.26]  Father, I thank you for your word. As Amy shared earlier, I just think what a gift it is to have the
[1547.26 --> 1552.32]  scriptures in printed form right in front of us on our phones. Lord, we thank you for this story,
[1553.28 --> 1558.90]  for the grace and the mercy and the patience of Jesus to minister to his disciples in places of need.
[1559.84 --> 1565.44]  Lord, you know our needs. You know our struggles. You know our fears and our doubts, and I ask that
[1565.44 --> 1573.20]  you by your spirit would meet our needs, that you would fill us with your power so that we in our
[1573.20 --> 1580.54]  ordinary lives would make known the good news in our words and our deeds that Jesus is alive. Amen.
[1582.40 --> 1587.64]  I invite you to stand and sing with me the whole story as we sing our closing song, King of Kings.
