[0.00 → 8.00] you know a couple of years ago someone gave me a comic, and it showed a picture of a preacher
[8.00 → 13.70] and showed the whole congregation sort of falling asleep and one children one child trying to leave
[13.70 → 17.82] the building through a window and I said there's a fine line between a long service and a hostage
[17.82 → 25.60] situation and I feel like we are like on the border of a hostage situation even this morning my wife
[25.60 → 31.40] said to me Dave if it's 10 to 11 don't preach your sermon, and it's almost 10 after 11.
[34.04 → 41.64] I'm not sure what to do um I really do wonder if it's worth waiting till next week to preach this
[41.64 → 44.38] sermon okay I'm going to preach
[44.38 → 51.40] did you hear what someone said like who said that
[51.40 → 57.08] okay I'm going to preach a very short sermon and I'm chopping it in my head as we speak
[57.08 → 63.36] so turn with me in your bibles to acts chapter 2. I am nervous
[63.36 → 69.38] I gave you the option and one person said to preach
[69.38 → 75.78] this is a passage that we spent a fair bit of time on
[75.78 → 81.48] in our baptism and profession class this is a well-known passage in the book of acts 2
[81.48 → 88.94] 42 to 47 they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to fellowship to the breaking of bread
[88.94 → 94.32] and to prayer everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles
[94.32 → 100.28] all the believers were together and had everything in common they sold property and possessions to give to
[100.28 → 109.00] anyone who had need every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts
[109.00 → 116.28] praising god and enjoying the favour of all people and the lord added to their number daily those who were being saved
[116.28 → 123.28] two weeks ago we had an extended conversation
[123.28 → 126.76] in our profession class about how it is that we grow
[126.76 → 130.76] how do we nurture our life in Jesus Christ in such a way that we have roots
[130.76 → 136.42] that we experience the life of the spirit just animating and strengthening and using us for the kingdom of god
[136.42 → 142.14] and we looked at acts 2 and simply asked the question of what is it that god has for us today in these words
[142.14 → 145.00] how is he speaking to us in these words
[145.00 → 149.94] and what we noticed and talked about is how discipleship in acts chapter 2 is actually quite
[149.94 → 155.62] simple we talked about how the way we grow in Christ is not a complicated ordeal and sometimes
[155.62 → 161.30] as believers we do make it complicated we do make it strange and when we look at this passage we realize
[161.30 → 167.62] this is fairly straightforward the movement of acts 2 is there is a set of practices that the disciples
[167.62 → 175.62] devoted themselves to and that led to them experiencing the life of Jesus in really profound ways and that led to the
[175.62 → 182.50] the favour of the church in the watching eyes of the neighbour and growth in the church through the power of god
[182.50 → 186.18] we talked about that word devoted
[186.18 → 192.34] peter shared that when he heard the word devoted what he heard was the way that an athlete like a hockey player
[192.34 → 198.98] which he was organizes their schedule around practices organize their diet around the next game, and they're sort of
[198.98 → 205.38] carving out space for that next hockey event nick talked about he's the one playing cello he talked
[205.38 → 210.42] about the way you practice and the way you organize your life so you have large chunks of time that do not
[210.42 → 216.58] get taken away from cello otherwise you will not advance as a cellist there's a sense in which they understood
[216.58 → 224.26] devoted means you have a single-minded interest in that one thing and acts 2 says the disciples the early
[224.26 → 231.30] church had a single-minded interest in four specific practices and what are they nick mentioned them
[232.10 → 240.50] the apostles teaching the scriptures to fellowship being together they were devoted to breaking a bread
[240.50 → 248.66] sharing a meal hospitality and to prayer those four things animated the life of the church in such a way that
[248.66 → 254.66] they experienced the renewing power of Jesus in their midst, and it brought forth joy it brought
[254.66 → 259.46] forth generosity it brought forth favour in the eyes of the watching world, and it grew the church
[261.14 → 265.78] and I want to talk just briefly then actually I'm actually not going to talk briefly I'm just going to
[265.78 → 272.66] diagram what I shared with our new members if you've been in our membership class you will not be
[272.66 → 278.18] foreign to this illustration and I could say so much more about it but I'm going to just be brief today
[278.66 → 290.66] this is acts 2 in a picture if you're a sermon diagrammed here you go we have the life of Jesus
[292.42 → 297.62] and then we have the church and enjoy my stick drawings those of you who are here for when I was a
[297.62 → 305.78] youth pastor you can mock me all you want to make sure there's equality little baby there we go in a diaper
[305.78 → 317.54] there you go the whole community, and then we have the way that the life of Jesus flows into the church
[318.18 → 323.54] and acts 2 says the way that the life of Jesus flows into the church is through the apostles teaching
[324.74 → 328.34] through fellowship through the breaking of bread
[328.34 → 339.62] and we spent a lot of time you guys remember this image in fact nick you referenced it we spent a
[339.62 → 345.54] lot of time saying think of a time in your life where you felt you were thriving in your life of
[345.54 → 349.62] Jesus Christ think of a time perhaps it was a serve trip perhaps it was spending time with your friends
[349.62 → 354.10] in devotion perhaps it was a camp that you're at where you felt like Jesus is at work here
[354.10 → 358.66] and as I asked the students to share this and I've done this with other people before they start
[358.66 → 364.90] talking about a friend they start talking about youth group they start talking about praying with
[364.90 → 368.50] family members around the table they start talking about the hospitality of friends in the church who
[368.50 → 374.10] invite them in and invariably and I do mean this when they talk about ways they experience the life
[374.10 → 380.58] of Jesus flowing into the life it often involves all four of these things and that shouldn't surprise
[380.58 → 386.90] anybody that when Luke or acts 2 describes how Jesus Christ started transforming the church it came
[386.90 → 394.74] through four very basic practices teaching fellowship the breaking of bread and prayer and I haven't done
[394.74 → 400.58] this with a lot of groups but I bet you the opposite is true if I were to ask you in the church describe
[400.58 → 407.06] a time when you're in a spiritual wasteland where you felt far from the lord where you are sensing like
[407.06 → 413.30] where is Christ where am I at in my relationship with the lord I'm guessing that these channels in
[413.30 → 421.78] one way or another were blocked you were not praying in that season you weren't really part of the church
[421.78 → 427.38] you weren't experiencing the gift of fellowship of Christian friendship the scriptures were collecting dust
[427.38 → 432.90] in your room and there wasn't a real sense of practicing hospitality experiencing the breaking of bread and
[432.90 → 438.18] remembering Christ's death and there's a sense in which when these channels are blocked it leads to
[438.18 → 444.90] spiritual wasteland in the church and just for the whole community this morning to reflect ask yourself
[445.54 → 453.14] how are these channels of grace operating in your life right now think of it in terms of a self-diagnostic
[453.14 → 458.34] how is prayer taking place in my life not just personally but with others how is hospitality and
[458.34 → 464.02] the breaking of bread happening in my life what about fellowship am I in meaningful community with
[464.02 → 469.30] those who love the lord and are spurring me on towards love and good deeds and are the scriptures being
[469.30 → 474.50] preached am I open to them on devotions do I experience time with other believers in youth group or
[474.50 → 482.66] small group or around the table hearing Christ speak by his word because what acts 2 says in a nutshell is
[482.66 → 490.18] the life of Jesus flows into the church through these channels of grace and when they're blocked we
[490.18 → 497.22] experienced a sense of distance and wasteland but when they're open we experience joy generosity we
[497.22 → 505.30] experience worship the richness of community and the watching world sees Jesus Christ at work in the church
[505.30 → 511.14] amen let's pray together
[514.02 → 518.82] father we thank you for your word, and we thank you for the way that you speak through the church of
[518.82 → 526.18] history and lord we ask that we would be a community that is grounded and devoted to the scriptures to
[526.18 → 532.10] fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer, and we ask that we would be the community that is alive
[532.10 → 539.06] in Jesus in such a way that the neighbours look at us and see Jesus at work the spirit on the move
[539.06 → 548.02] and transformation that is visible lord to that end would you pour out your Holy Spirit on all of us amen
