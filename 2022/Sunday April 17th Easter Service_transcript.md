[0.00 --> 3.66]  You know, Carolyn mentioned the youth choir, which is phenomenal.
[3.80 --> 4.76]  But you know what else was phenomenal?
[4.96 --> 6.56]  These three little girls in the front were dancing.
[7.62 --> 11.24]  And I thought, if there's ever a Sunday where you let your girls dance in church, this is the one.
[11.72 --> 13.68]  And that was a blessing to us here up front.
[13.76 --> 14.80]  And Wayne, you didn't join in.
[14.84 --> 16.22]  I don't know why you weren't up there dancing.
[16.60 --> 18.08]  We can expect that for the next song.
[19.84 --> 23.90]  If you've been with us the last number of months, you'll know that we've been preaching our way through the gospel of John.
[24.34 --> 29.16]  And this morning we get to John after all the accounts of Jesus' ministry, his miracles, all that he's done.
[29.16 --> 33.16]  And now John's going to give his own account of witnessing Jesus' resurrection.
[33.92 --> 39.70]  Some say this is John's, or the first account, I should say, the first account of believing in Jesus as a risen Savior.
[39.84 --> 44.72]  So if you have your Bible, digital or physical, turn with me to John chapter 20, and we'll read it together.
[52.90 --> 58.10]  Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb
[58.10 --> 60.80]  and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.
[61.96 --> 66.46]  So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said,
[66.80 --> 69.56]  They've taken our Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they've put him.
[70.68 --> 72.86]  So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.
[73.02 --> 76.86]  Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
[77.68 --> 81.28]  He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there, but did not go in.
[82.10 --> 85.54]  Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb.
[85.54 --> 90.66]  He saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus' head.
[91.40 --> 94.00]  The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.
[94.92 --> 98.50]  Finally, the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside.
[99.42 --> 101.44]  He saw and believed.
[102.56 --> 106.68]  They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.
[107.44 --> 109.56]  And then the disciples went back to where they were staying.
[109.56 --> 118.04]  As we've worked our way through this series on the Gospel of John,
[118.38 --> 120.86]  you'll remember that we did a number of interviews with people in our church
[120.86 --> 122.94]  about their story of coming to believe in Jesus.
[123.36 --> 127.16]  We interviewed Sonia, we interviewed Carrie, we interviewed Dan, and we interviewed Peter.
[127.70 --> 128.96]  And I can still remember their interviews.
[129.06 --> 130.12]  There they are up on the screen.
[131.14 --> 135.40]  I remember Dan sharing how, as he grew up in a very different religious home,
[135.40 --> 138.88]  how important it was for him to ask questions about the faith and about the Bible
[138.88 --> 141.88]  that were serious and not be felt stupid for asking them.
[143.18 --> 147.12]  I remember Sonia sharing about how she came to discover that God is a loving Father
[147.12 --> 149.34]  and she can trust her life in His hands.
[150.46 --> 153.82]  I remember Carrie talking about this discovery of this reality of sin
[153.82 --> 156.16]  and this desperate need of, like, how do I solve this?
[156.18 --> 157.18]  How do I get out of this?
[157.38 --> 159.90]  What will free me from this powerful thing called sin?
[160.84 --> 162.98]  And I remember Peter talking about a walk he went on
[162.98 --> 165.30]  where he felt so convicted by the Spirit
[165.30 --> 167.28]  and he was just sharing his sin before God
[167.28 --> 169.50]  and found the peace of Christ in His forgiveness.
[170.44 --> 172.50]  Each of them had very different backgrounds,
[172.66 --> 173.82]  very different religious backgrounds,
[173.98 --> 175.84]  Sikh, Muslim, nominal Christian, etc.
[176.02 --> 178.82]  And yet God, by His amazing power, by His grace,
[178.92 --> 180.48]  brought them to a place where they say,
[181.24 --> 181.88]  I believe.
[182.46 --> 183.90]  I believe in Jesus Christ,
[184.30 --> 187.90]  who was crucified, died, buried, resurrected, and Lord.
[189.78 --> 192.00]  The Gospel of John, if you don't already know this,
[192.00 --> 193.92]  is all about belief.
[194.46 --> 197.40]  He's not, for a second, interested in just writing a biography
[197.40 --> 198.36]  with some information.
[198.76 --> 200.18]  He doesn't want you just to know a few tidbits
[200.18 --> 201.86]  about stories of things that Jesus did.
[202.16 --> 204.12]  John wants to grab you, as it were,
[204.18 --> 206.10]  through the pages of this Gospel account and say,
[206.52 --> 209.42]  I want you to believe in Jesus.
[210.46 --> 213.38]  In fact, you might say the theme verse of this whole book
[213.38 --> 215.90]  is John 20, verse 31 and 32.
[216.16 --> 217.64]  We started our series by reading this,
[217.70 --> 219.24]  and I'll read it again now, where he says,
[219.24 --> 221.38]  Jesus performed many other signs
[221.38 --> 222.92]  in the presence of His disciples,
[223.56 --> 225.00]  which are not recorded in this book.
[225.08 --> 225.58]  Thanks, John.
[225.62 --> 226.40]  I really appreciate that.
[227.02 --> 228.78]  But these are written so that you may believe
[228.78 --> 231.24]  that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God,
[231.30 --> 235.02]  and that by believing, you may have life in His name.
[236.64 --> 238.64]  In our passage this morning, John 20,
[238.76 --> 239.68]  where they go to the tomb,
[240.02 --> 241.36]  this really is John saying,
[241.62 --> 243.54]  this is when I came to believe.
[244.22 --> 245.96]  He tells the story of Peter, of Mary,
[245.96 --> 247.20]  as we're going to look at next week,
[247.32 --> 249.60]  and he tells his own story of the moment where he said,
[250.50 --> 250.96]  this is it.
[251.62 --> 253.66]  I see it, and I believe it.
[254.40 --> 255.36]  This is true.
[256.48 --> 258.26]  And John does, I think, what you and I would do
[258.26 --> 259.24]  if we were in his circumstance.
[259.94 --> 262.46]  It's not easy to know how to describe a resurrection.
[262.90 --> 264.80]  No one's given the tools for giving information
[264.80 --> 265.92]  about how to make it possible.
[266.32 --> 268.32]  John simply says what he experienced.
[268.76 --> 271.12]  He walks us into and allows us to experience
[271.12 --> 273.24]  what he and Peter had when they ran to the tomb,
[273.24 --> 274.46]  to see what they saw,
[274.52 --> 276.50]  and to grapple with the conclusion they came to,
[276.60 --> 279.06]  which is, this body is not here.
[281.88 --> 284.24]  Now the story starts with Mary.
[284.90 --> 286.76]  Mary Magdalene going to the tomb early in the morning,
[286.84 --> 288.20]  and she's not there to check up on it.
[288.66 --> 289.88]  She's not there out of suspicion.
[290.36 --> 292.36]  She's there to do what people would do as custom
[292.36 --> 294.44]  at that time, and that is to weep, to cry,
[294.94 --> 297.52]  to grieve at the death of someone they loved dearly,
[297.60 --> 298.44]  someone they followed.
[299.18 --> 300.56]  And Mary gets there early in the morning,
[300.56 --> 302.46]  and the first thing she sees is that the tombstone
[302.46 --> 304.92]  is rolled away, and that confirms one of her fears,
[305.24 --> 307.32]  which was, people will steal the body.
[307.88 --> 309.58]  And so she ran back, not out of joy,
[309.68 --> 311.02]  not out of a sense of Jesus being risen,
[311.32 --> 313.02]  but saying to Peter and to John,
[313.26 --> 315.04]  someone stole Jesus' body.
[315.82 --> 318.16]  And that got their attention so fast that John says,
[318.28 --> 320.52]  next, they got up and they ran to the tomb.
[321.56 --> 324.06]  And just a parenthetical comment I should make here,
[324.20 --> 325.90]  if you read closely the passage,
[326.02 --> 327.70]  you'll know that John never actually says his own name.
[327.70 --> 330.12]  He says, the other disciple, or even better,
[330.46 --> 332.34]  the other disciple, the beloved disciple,
[332.50 --> 333.48]  whom Jesus loved.
[334.24 --> 335.66]  And I always think that's an interesting way
[335.66 --> 336.46]  to describe yourself.
[336.96 --> 338.64]  I just think if I talked about myself
[338.64 --> 339.82]  or wrote a story about myself,
[339.90 --> 341.76]  and I described myself as the son of my dad,
[341.92 --> 343.66]  the son who my dad loved,
[344.08 --> 345.96]  I'd have some hot water with my brothers to deal with.
[346.70 --> 349.04]  But John's describing that because he wants us to know,
[349.14 --> 350.08]  not that he's the favorite,
[350.76 --> 353.20]  but that he is a close, close friend of Jesus.
[353.32 --> 354.82]  In fact, two commentators suggest
[354.82 --> 356.52]  that John is the closest friend of Jesus.
[357.38 --> 358.44]  And therefore, what he wants you to know
[358.44 --> 359.98]  is you can trust what he's about to say.
[361.20 --> 363.68]  And he describes himself being a faster runner than Peter.
[363.78 --> 364.56]  Love that detail.
[364.96 --> 366.32]  He gets to the tomb faster than Peter.
[366.40 --> 367.64]  Peter's got to figure out how to catch up
[367.64 --> 368.46]  and see what's going on.
[368.80 --> 369.50]  Gets to the tomb,
[369.68 --> 370.46]  right at the entranceway,
[370.52 --> 371.10]  doesn't go in,
[371.14 --> 372.10]  and the first thing he sees
[372.10 --> 374.18]  is the strips of linen lying on the ground.
[375.36 --> 376.72]  And he observes that reality.
[376.86 --> 378.20]  And then we're told Peter, you know,
[378.28 --> 378.90]  finally gets there,
[378.94 --> 379.70]  runs right past him,
[379.70 --> 380.66]  and in true Peter fashion,
[380.78 --> 382.08]  goes right into the tomb,
[382.84 --> 383.46]  looks around,
[383.54 --> 385.00]  and he sees the same thing that John sees,
[385.34 --> 386.24]  the linens on the ground
[386.24 --> 387.64]  that would be wrapped around Jesus' body,
[387.74 --> 388.90]  and then the added detail,
[389.30 --> 391.50]  the face cloth that would be wrapped around his head.
[391.56 --> 392.92]  And that's an important detail.
[394.12 --> 394.74]  If you remember,
[394.88 --> 396.36]  I know not everyone was here a few weeks ago,
[396.42 --> 397.54]  but when we preached on Jesus
[397.54 --> 398.92]  raising Lazarus from the dead,
[399.44 --> 401.60]  there's that scene where Jesus looks at the tomb,
[401.92 --> 403.30]  and he calls out in a loud voice,
[403.42 --> 405.36]  Lazarus, come out, right?
[406.08 --> 407.04]  And Lazarus comes out,
[407.04 --> 407.62]  and what happens?
[407.74 --> 409.42]  What's the first thing that we're told they do?
[410.04 --> 412.30]  They take the cloth off his face.
[413.40 --> 415.14]  And John and Peter look at the linen,
[415.22 --> 415.98]  they look at the cloth,
[416.16 --> 417.06]  all the evidence,
[417.58 --> 418.28]  and they say,
[418.66 --> 420.14]  this is not what Mary thinks.
[420.72 --> 421.76]  If they stole the body,
[421.86 --> 423.42]  all the linen would still be on the body.
[423.48 --> 424.98]  The face cloth would be gone with the body,
[425.06 --> 425.74]  but here it is.
[425.96 --> 428.06]  And John and Peter can't help but say,
[428.36 --> 429.44]  something more is happening.
[431.86 --> 432.68]  Now, this week,
[432.76 --> 434.70]  I found myself in a rabbit trail of reading,
[434.70 --> 436.86]  and I came across a German scholar
[436.86 --> 438.94]  named Wolfhard Pannenberg.
[439.58 --> 440.06]  And I just think,
[440.12 --> 441.18]  if you name your child Wolfhard,
[441.70 --> 442.86]  he has to become a scholar.
[443.68 --> 445.44]  And to the young moms who are expecting,
[445.78 --> 447.20]  have you thought about the name Wolfhard?
[448.14 --> 448.50]  You know.
[449.18 --> 450.42]  He's a German Lutheran scholar
[450.42 --> 451.40]  who's got an interesting story,
[451.48 --> 452.54]  didn't grow up in a religious home,
[452.64 --> 454.86]  had a dramatic conversion when he was 16 years old,
[455.02 --> 456.52]  lived through the war after that,
[456.66 --> 457.88]  and then later in his life,
[458.04 --> 459.90]  he basically dedicated his attention
[459.90 --> 461.82]  to understanding the testimony
[461.82 --> 462.92]  around Jesus' resurrection.
[462.92 --> 464.06]  Like, what was it meant?
[464.32 --> 464.96]  What does it mean?
[465.04 --> 465.84]  What were the other things
[465.84 --> 466.76]  that were being said about Jesus?
[466.86 --> 467.76]  And after all his study,
[467.86 --> 468.54]  all his scholarship,
[468.84 --> 470.92]  he makes this startling quote,
[471.02 --> 471.58]  in my opinion.
[471.68 --> 472.14]  He says,
[473.00 --> 474.50]  the evidence for Jesus' resurrection
[474.50 --> 476.46]  is so strong
[476.46 --> 478.30]  that nobody would question it
[478.30 --> 479.22]  except for two things.
[480.28 --> 480.68]  First,
[481.12 --> 482.52]  it's a very unusual event.
[483.58 --> 484.46]  Yeah, I guess, yes.
[484.86 --> 485.24]  Second,
[485.48 --> 486.66]  if you believe it happened,
[486.96 --> 488.60]  you have to change the way you live.
[490.16 --> 492.62]  That's Wolfhard Pannenberg's summary.
[492.92 --> 493.60]  of the situation.
[493.72 --> 494.74]  What he means to say by that,
[494.78 --> 495.50]  you have to change the way you live.
[495.70 --> 496.92]  If he did rise from the dead,
[497.18 --> 498.52]  all his claims about his identity,
[498.86 --> 499.48]  about who he is,
[499.66 --> 500.78]  about who we are,
[500.86 --> 501.70]  and the purpose of life,
[501.86 --> 502.34]  are true.
[502.78 --> 504.02]  And we therefore have to submit
[504.02 --> 505.38]  and live under his good,
[505.46 --> 506.28]  loving kingship
[506.28 --> 507.40]  and order our life around
[507.40 --> 508.80]  that new reality of resurrection.
[511.18 --> 512.30]  Now, in verse 8,
[512.58 --> 514.48]  my two favorite verses are coming next.
[514.54 --> 515.16]  In verse 8,
[515.32 --> 516.70]  John gives his own testimony.
[516.70 --> 518.20]  And this may very well be
[518.20 --> 519.76]  the most unceremonious,
[520.34 --> 522.02]  boring testimony of faith
[522.02 --> 522.96]  you've ever heard.
[523.04 --> 524.40]  It's also the shortest I've ever read.
[524.62 --> 525.38]  This is what he says.
[525.70 --> 526.02]  Finally,
[526.62 --> 527.36]  the other disciple,
[527.92 --> 528.22]  John,
[528.72 --> 530.14]  who had reached the tomb first,
[530.32 --> 530.90]  faster runner,
[531.28 --> 532.46]  also went inside.
[533.10 --> 533.80]  He saw
[533.80 --> 535.52]  and he believed.
[536.80 --> 537.98]  That's all he says.
[539.00 --> 540.10]  And I want you to pause
[540.10 --> 541.90]  and try your very best
[541.90 --> 542.96]  to imagine this scene.
[543.72 --> 544.44]  John's in the tomb.
[544.44 --> 546.96]  John had been with Jesus
[546.96 --> 547.66]  his whole life.
[547.74 --> 548.70]  He heard all the stories.
[548.84 --> 550.10]  He witnessed all the miracles.
[550.32 --> 552.14]  He knew Jesus very closely.
[552.54 --> 553.94]  And there he sits in the tomb,
[554.60 --> 555.32]  seeing the linen,
[555.54 --> 556.24]  seeing the cloth,
[556.44 --> 557.60]  seeing Peter wrestling with it,
[557.66 --> 558.76]  seeing the stone rolled away.
[559.48 --> 561.10]  And the only conclusion
[561.10 --> 562.18]  he could make is,
[562.54 --> 563.42]  this is not theft.
[564.34 --> 565.46]  This is resurrection.
[566.92 --> 568.54]  This is not some weird thing
[568.54 --> 569.06]  that happened.
[569.54 --> 571.04]  Jesus, who predicted it,
[571.54 --> 573.34]  actually rose from the dead.
[575.20 --> 576.40]  And there we have it,
[576.42 --> 576.86]  right there,
[576.98 --> 578.20]  the very first testimony
[578.20 --> 580.38]  of the first believer
[580.38 --> 581.36]  of Jesus,
[581.50 --> 582.42]  not as just a friend,
[583.24 --> 584.44]  not as just a healer,
[584.58 --> 585.24]  not as a teacher,
[585.46 --> 587.80]  but as a resurrected Lord.
[588.68 --> 589.90]  That's how John gives it to us.
[590.90 --> 591.74]  Now the next verse,
[591.84 --> 592.08]  I think,
[592.12 --> 592.84]  is probably one of the most
[592.84 --> 593.56]  interesting to me
[593.56 --> 594.30]  in the whole passage.
[594.66 --> 595.18]  Here's why.
[595.68 --> 596.88]  Believing is not the same thing
[596.88 --> 597.48]  as understanding.
[598.44 --> 598.98]  And if you remember
[598.98 --> 600.00]  back to the testimonies
[600.00 --> 600.70]  where people shared
[600.70 --> 601.36]  about their own story
[601.36 --> 601.88]  in our church
[601.88 --> 602.58]  of coming to faith,
[602.64 --> 603.14]  you'll remember that
[603.14 --> 603.82]  there's a sense of like,
[603.90 --> 605.18]  okay, I believe Jesus
[605.18 --> 606.04]  is who he says he is.
[606.12 --> 607.06]  I believe the scriptures
[607.06 --> 607.54]  are true.
[607.66 --> 608.48]  I believe that he rose.
[608.56 --> 609.36]  He forgives my sin.
[609.50 --> 611.02]  But what does it mean?
[611.76 --> 613.30]  Like, what is the understanding?
[613.38 --> 614.04]  How do I read the Bible?
[614.14 --> 614.62]  How do I live?
[614.66 --> 615.44]  There's all these questions
[615.44 --> 616.58]  of sort of making sense
[616.58 --> 617.16]  of the event
[617.16 --> 618.24]  of what Jesus has done.
[618.90 --> 619.48]  John and Peter
[619.48 --> 620.94]  have to do the same thing.
[621.64 --> 622.60]  Listen to what he writes.
[622.92 --> 623.74]  They, verse 9,
[623.84 --> 624.46]  he and Peter,
[624.80 --> 626.58]  still did not understand
[626.58 --> 627.32]  from scriptures
[627.32 --> 629.92]  that Jesus had to rise
[629.92 --> 630.44]  from the dead.
[631.76 --> 632.02]  Don't you think
[632.02 --> 633.06]  that's an interesting sentence?
[633.54 --> 634.44]  They didn't understand yet
[634.44 --> 634.98]  from the scriptures
[634.98 --> 636.18]  not that Jesus
[636.18 --> 637.42]  was going to rise
[637.42 --> 637.88]  from the dead,
[638.00 --> 639.66]  but that he had to rise
[639.66 --> 640.26]  from the dead.
[641.02 --> 641.84]  And that statement
[641.84 --> 643.72]  has the entire freight
[643.72 --> 645.38]  of the Old Testament story
[645.38 --> 646.44]  built into it.
[646.90 --> 647.62]  That is to say,
[647.86 --> 649.06]  the plan all along,
[649.14 --> 649.98]  which Peter and John
[649.98 --> 651.02]  did not comprehend yet,
[651.20 --> 652.78]  the plan all along
[652.78 --> 653.58]  was for God
[653.58 --> 654.70]  in his grace,
[654.84 --> 655.58]  power, and mercy
[655.58 --> 656.92]  to send Christ
[656.92 --> 658.36]  to do what no human
[658.36 --> 658.80]  could do,
[659.06 --> 660.24]  to defeat the power of sin,
[660.58 --> 661.34]  rise victorious,
[661.34 --> 662.24]  and establish
[662.24 --> 663.26]  the kingdom of power
[663.26 --> 664.40]  and love and grace forever.
[665.06 --> 666.16]  But they need to go back
[666.16 --> 666.76]  to their scriptures
[666.76 --> 668.46]  to figure this out
[668.46 --> 669.26]  and make sense of it.
[670.82 --> 672.24]  Now, this past Monday,
[672.86 --> 674.12]  that is five days ago,
[674.18 --> 674.72]  six days ago,
[674.98 --> 676.06]  we had our membership class
[676.06 --> 676.84]  in the fireside room
[676.84 --> 677.36]  with a number of people
[677.36 --> 678.24]  who are new to our church.
[678.70 --> 679.84]  And I went into my full
[679.84 --> 680.66]  youth pastor mode
[680.66 --> 681.70]  where I got the whiteboard out
[681.70 --> 682.84]  and I drew the whole story
[682.84 --> 683.22]  of the Bible.
[684.24 --> 685.34]  And as we finished it,
[685.38 --> 685.54]  you know,
[685.62 --> 686.30]  I went on forever
[686.30 --> 687.62]  and then when we finished that,
[687.70 --> 688.70]  people were lingering afterwards
[688.70 --> 690.40]  and one woman
[690.40 --> 691.20]  said to me afterwards,
[691.28 --> 691.50]  she's like,
[691.54 --> 691.84]  you know,
[692.46 --> 694.00]  that is so important.
[694.94 --> 695.50]  You should preach
[695.50 --> 696.22]  on that sometime.
[697.14 --> 698.08]  And I was like super offended.
[698.16 --> 698.32]  I'm like,
[698.34 --> 698.70]  who are you?
[698.76 --> 699.50]  You're brand new to our church.
[699.54 --> 699.84]  How do you know
[699.84 --> 700.70]  I don't preach on this stuff?
[701.34 --> 702.04]  I'm just kidding.
[702.12 --> 702.96]  It was an amazing comment.
[703.12 --> 704.34]  She meant it in good faith.
[704.48 --> 705.24]  But here's the thing.
[705.44 --> 706.18]  Challenge accepted.
[706.66 --> 707.20]  This morning,
[707.28 --> 708.06]  I am going to tell
[708.06 --> 708.80]  on the whiteboard
[708.80 --> 709.80]  the whole story of the Bible
[709.80 --> 711.36]  and then link it back.
[711.80 --> 712.34]  You're all nervous
[712.34 --> 712.80]  because you're worried
[712.80 --> 713.78]  how long this is going to go.
[714.18 --> 714.96]  Link it back
[714.96 --> 716.14]  to John's own struggle
[716.14 --> 717.34]  with the Old Testament story.
[717.34 --> 719.96]  And if this goes phenomenally poorly,
[720.44 --> 721.58]  this is all your fault, Judy.
[721.64 --> 722.52]  This is your idea.
[723.42 --> 724.30]  So here we go.
[725.44 --> 726.06]  Poor Judy.
[726.36 --> 727.10]  It's a great idea.
[729.38 --> 729.84]  All right.
[729.88 --> 731.88]  And hopefully it's bright enough.
[731.98 --> 732.70]  I've got to come down here.
[734.36 --> 735.56]  So just look at the screen
[735.56 --> 737.40]  if it's a little too far away
[737.40 --> 738.10]  for you in the back.
[739.92 --> 740.64]  Thanks, Jonathan.
[740.88 --> 741.40]  Thanks, Jake.
[741.40 --> 743.30]  So,
[744.02 --> 746.20]  John and Peter
[746.20 --> 747.98]  are at the empty tomb.
[748.70 --> 750.16]  And what they know for certain
[750.16 --> 751.16]  as they sit there
[751.16 --> 753.28]  is that Jesus who died
[753.28 --> 753.88]  and was crucified,
[754.02 --> 754.60]  they witnessed it,
[754.66 --> 755.72]  has now risen from the dead.
[755.78 --> 756.48]  The tomb is empty.
[756.94 --> 757.82]  But that statement
[757.82 --> 759.24]  of Jesus rising from the dead
[759.24 --> 760.30]  and resurrecting from the dead
[760.30 --> 761.30]  makes no sense
[761.30 --> 762.76]  if you do not know the story.
[762.96 --> 763.90]  If you just go say to someone,
[763.98 --> 765.38]  hey, Jesus rose from the dead
[765.38 --> 766.32]  just by itself,
[766.34 --> 767.28]  that makes no sense.
[767.62 --> 768.50]  And so they had to do
[768.50 --> 769.90]  some hard work on the Scriptures
[769.90 --> 772.12]  and go back to the story.
[772.40 --> 772.62]  Okay?
[772.98 --> 774.16]  And the story begins,
[774.70 --> 775.56]  I use these arrows,
[776.14 --> 776.74]  begins how?
[776.90 --> 777.54]  In the beginning,
[779.12 --> 780.06]  yeah, you guys are learning.
[780.30 --> 780.82]  In the beginning,
[780.98 --> 782.38]  God created the world.
[782.52 --> 783.30]  And it was a good world.
[783.38 --> 784.22]  It was an orderly world.
[784.28 --> 785.04]  It was a beautiful world.
[785.08 --> 786.10]  It was a colorful world.
[786.58 --> 787.88]  Places humans in this world
[787.88 --> 788.80]  to enjoy it,
[788.82 --> 789.62]  to develop it,
[789.68 --> 790.44]  to cultivate it,
[790.50 --> 791.22]  and to steward
[791.22 --> 792.06]  this beautiful world
[792.06 --> 793.12]  that he's placed them in
[793.12 --> 794.40]  as his image bearers.
[794.84 --> 796.28]  They do that in harmony with God.
[796.36 --> 797.02]  They do that in harmony
[797.02 --> 797.50]  with each other,
[797.58 --> 798.58]  in harmony with the creation
[798.58 --> 799.86]  and even with themselves.
[800.82 --> 801.92]  Three chapters later,
[802.06 --> 802.70]  what happens?
[806.92 --> 807.28]  Sin.
[807.92 --> 808.50]  The fall.
[808.62 --> 809.42]  I don't like to use the word
[809.42 --> 810.42]  the fall because when I talk
[810.42 --> 810.96]  to new believers,
[811.04 --> 811.16]  I'm like,
[811.20 --> 811.76]  who fell where?
[811.86 --> 812.54]  Like, what does that mean?
[813.06 --> 813.84]  Rebellion is probably
[813.84 --> 814.58]  the best word.
[815.26 --> 815.68]  And they, you know,
[815.74 --> 816.36]  Adam and Eve bought
[816.36 --> 817.38]  this insidious lie
[817.38 --> 818.70]  that instead of living
[818.70 --> 819.78]  under God's good rule,
[820.46 --> 821.40]  enjoying his goodness,
[821.54 --> 822.32]  living in his world,
[822.50 --> 823.76]  they wanted to take that role.
[823.84 --> 824.92]  They wanted to be God.
[825.00 --> 826.18]  They wanted to be in charge
[826.18 --> 827.20]  and call the shots
[827.20 --> 827.62]  for themselves.
[827.76 --> 828.82]  And out of that reality,
[828.82 --> 829.68]  out of that decision,
[829.90 --> 830.96]  became this thing
[830.96 --> 831.78]  that Carrie Hamlin
[831.78 --> 832.46]  in her testimony
[832.46 --> 833.44]  said she was struggling with,
[833.56 --> 835.06]  that reality of sin
[835.06 --> 836.58]  enters God's creation
[836.58 --> 838.66]  and it messes with creation.
[839.54 --> 839.74]  You know,
[839.78 --> 840.76]  the way I often describe it,
[840.82 --> 842.68]  sin is like a parasitical thing.
[842.82 --> 843.60]  It's like a cancer
[843.60 --> 844.90]  that takes the goodness
[844.90 --> 845.54]  of creation,
[845.66 --> 846.56]  the goodness of relationship,
[846.74 --> 847.94]  and it messes with it.
[848.34 --> 849.16]  It distorts
[849.16 --> 851.06]  and disconnects us from God.
[851.24 --> 852.58]  It destroys relationship
[852.58 --> 853.16]  with one another.
[853.24 --> 854.18]  It even disconnects us
[854.18 --> 855.36]  from the life of creation itself
[855.36 --> 856.92]  and puts us at odds
[856.92 --> 857.84]  with ourself.
[858.64 --> 859.54]  And Genesis 3 to 11
[859.54 --> 860.70]  narrates this cancer,
[860.80 --> 861.82]  this parasite of sin
[861.82 --> 863.56]  spreading through the human condition,
[863.76 --> 865.00]  spreading through humankind.
[865.20 --> 865.40]  In fact,
[865.44 --> 866.24]  in Genesis 11,
[866.66 --> 867.48]  you have, you know,
[867.58 --> 868.16]  Adam and Eve
[868.16 --> 869.04]  in the garden rebelling.
[869.12 --> 869.96]  Now you have a whole city
[869.96 --> 870.98]  trying to build itself,
[871.08 --> 872.04]  making a name for itself
[872.04 --> 873.08]  apart from God.
[874.36 --> 876.84]  Then we get God's response.
[877.04 --> 878.28]  This cross is not big enough here.
[878.36 --> 878.78]  Sorry, people.
[878.78 --> 881.70]  God's response
[881.70 --> 882.78]  to this human rebellion,
[882.94 --> 883.54]  to the spreading,
[883.72 --> 884.62]  this cancer of sin
[884.62 --> 885.98]  is to call one man Abraham
[885.98 --> 887.00]  who will become
[887.00 --> 887.82]  the people of Israel.
[887.90 --> 888.64]  And he says to Abraham
[888.64 --> 889.30]  what is a blueprint
[889.30 --> 890.66]  for the entire Old Testament.
[890.76 --> 890.98]  He says,
[891.06 --> 892.60]  Abraham, I will bless you.
[893.18 --> 893.90]  And that word blessing
[893.90 --> 895.24]  is the fullness of human life
[895.24 --> 895.86]  from the beginning.
[895.98 --> 896.46]  There's the light.
[897.60 --> 898.30]  I will bless you.
[898.38 --> 899.58]  I will make your name great.
[899.70 --> 901.00]  I will make you a great nation.
[901.10 --> 902.46]  I will bless those who bless you
[902.46 --> 903.68]  and curse those who curse you.
[903.72 --> 904.94]  And here's the real kicker.
[905.00 --> 905.98]  The final blessing is
[905.98 --> 908.34]  all the nations of the earth
[908.34 --> 909.64]  will be blessed through you.
[910.42 --> 911.64]  All the nations of the earth
[911.64 --> 912.36]  will be blessed through you.
[912.40 --> 914.00]  So God turns Abraham into Israel.
[914.34 --> 915.90]  He places Israel so strategically
[915.90 --> 917.00]  in the very center
[917.00 --> 917.94]  of the ancient Near East.
[918.00 --> 918.36]  And he says,
[918.80 --> 920.12]  you listen to my instructions.
[920.90 --> 922.48]  You live in my presence, Israel.
[922.72 --> 924.02]  You live right in the center
[924.02 --> 925.02]  of the ancient Near East
[925.02 --> 926.36]  and you show the world
[926.36 --> 928.46]  my love, my compassion,
[928.64 --> 929.84]  my power, and my grace.
[930.22 --> 931.26]  As people get to know you,
[931.34 --> 932.12]  they will see me
[932.12 --> 933.84]  and they will experience the blessing
[933.84 --> 935.10]  of how they're created
[935.10 --> 935.90]  to be from the beginning.
[935.90 --> 939.24]  And they lived happily ever after.
[939.84 --> 941.26]  It was phenomenal from that point on.
[942.60 --> 943.86]  No, it was not.
[943.96 --> 945.00]  In fact, my favorite summary
[945.00 --> 945.96]  of the Old Testament story
[945.96 --> 947.24]  from one of my former youth was,
[947.52 --> 947.54]  quote,
[947.62 --> 949.10]  it was an epic failure.
[950.22 --> 951.26]  Israel was an epic failure.
[951.38 --> 952.52]  They rejected God's instruction.
[952.64 --> 953.56]  They didn't care about his rules.
[953.66 --> 954.72]  They didn't want to follow his ways.
[954.82 --> 955.80]  They chased after the gods
[955.80 --> 956.36]  of the nations.
[956.70 --> 957.66]  And as a result, God said,
[957.74 --> 958.06]  you know what?
[958.10 --> 959.14]  This is so far
[959.14 --> 960.26]  from my intention for Israel
[960.26 --> 961.42]  that you can be dragged off
[961.42 --> 961.92]  in captivity
[961.92 --> 963.28]  just like other nations would.
[963.28 --> 966.64]  Then after 400 years of silence,
[967.58 --> 969.36]  in obscurity comes this boy
[969.36 --> 970.58]  born in Bethlehem.
[971.06 --> 972.08]  And there's all this hoopla
[972.08 --> 972.92]  around this boy.
[973.60 --> 974.50]  Even more intriguing to me
[974.50 --> 975.48]  is that for 30 years,
[975.62 --> 976.28]  this boy, Jesus,
[976.78 --> 978.20]  lives in complete obscurity
[978.20 --> 979.58]  building furniture with his dad.
[981.18 --> 982.82]  Then he comes out in the public
[982.82 --> 985.72]  and makes the strangest announcement.
[986.76 --> 987.38]  Jesus says,
[987.38 --> 988.88]  the time has come.
[990.08 --> 991.70]  The kingdom of God is near.
[992.34 --> 995.32]  Repent and believe the good news.
[995.60 --> 996.98]  He uses that phrase,
[998.94 --> 1002.24]  kingdom of God.
[1002.90 --> 1003.36]  And for us,
[1003.40 --> 1004.34]  that's a strange statement.
[1004.46 --> 1005.58]  But then Jesus starts teaching
[1005.58 --> 1006.02]  on the kingdom.
[1006.18 --> 1006.80]  He gives parables
[1006.80 --> 1007.56]  and illustrations
[1007.56 --> 1008.66]  and all sorts of stories
[1008.66 --> 1009.62]  about what the kingdom's like.
[1009.64 --> 1010.30]  And then he starts doing
[1010.30 --> 1010.88]  some miracles.
[1011.34 --> 1012.22]  He heals a man.
[1012.46 --> 1013.80]  He brings someone back to life.
[1014.02 --> 1015.08]  He casts out demons.
[1015.46 --> 1016.66]  Sick people become better.
[1016.66 --> 1017.50]  And he starts showing them
[1017.50 --> 1018.34]  over and over again
[1018.34 --> 1019.50]  what the kingdom is like.
[1019.56 --> 1020.64]  And people start to realize
[1020.64 --> 1023.08]  that's how life was supposed to be.
[1023.86 --> 1024.46]  No sickness,
[1025.12 --> 1025.70]  no death,
[1026.02 --> 1026.76]  no cancer,
[1026.98 --> 1027.96]  no natural disasters.
[1028.28 --> 1028.94]  And this kingdom
[1028.94 --> 1030.48]  is God's creation.
[1031.82 --> 1032.86]  Jesus, very surprisingly,
[1033.06 --> 1033.76]  then gets betrayed
[1033.76 --> 1034.82]  by one of his own disciples.
[1035.06 --> 1035.66]  He gets arrested
[1035.66 --> 1036.70]  and crucified,
[1037.00 --> 1038.14]  which we celebrated that
[1038.14 --> 1038.72]  two days ago.
[1039.82 --> 1040.90]  And people had no idea
[1040.90 --> 1041.74]  even when it happened
[1041.74 --> 1042.82]  that that was God's plan
[1042.82 --> 1044.40]  to deal with this parasite of sin
[1044.40 --> 1045.02]  and bring healing
[1045.02 --> 1045.78]  to his creation.
[1046.66 --> 1047.42]  Even more stunning
[1047.42 --> 1048.64]  to all the original witnesses
[1048.64 --> 1049.36]  was that Jesus,
[1049.54 --> 1050.20]  who was buried,
[1050.60 --> 1051.46]  they saw his body
[1051.46 --> 1052.04]  go in a tomb.
[1052.36 --> 1052.92]  Many people,
[1053.04 --> 1053.92]  including Nicodemus,
[1054.20 --> 1055.44]  embalmed this body
[1055.44 --> 1056.04]  with linens.
[1056.38 --> 1057.26]  They did not see coming
[1057.26 --> 1057.72]  that Jesus,
[1057.90 --> 1058.58]  three days later,
[1058.98 --> 1059.54]  Easter Sunday,
[1059.74 --> 1062.28]  would rise over death itself.
[1064.24 --> 1065.56]  Jesus then appeared to people.
[1065.82 --> 1066.60]  He gave some more teaching
[1066.60 --> 1067.14]  on the kingdom,
[1067.44 --> 1068.56]  but he didn't stay long.
[1069.34 --> 1070.14]  He poured out
[1070.14 --> 1070.98]  his Holy Spirit
[1070.98 --> 1072.32]  and he sent
[1072.32 --> 1074.26]  his group of disciples,
[1074.66 --> 1075.30]  his church.
[1075.44 --> 1075.72]  He said,
[1075.94 --> 1076.88]  make known the good news
[1076.88 --> 1078.18]  that the kingdom of God
[1078.18 --> 1078.60]  is here.
[1079.00 --> 1079.86]  Show them that the forgiveness
[1079.86 --> 1080.88]  of sins is present
[1080.88 --> 1081.92]  by what I have accomplished
[1081.92 --> 1082.90]  in my death and resurrection
[1082.90 --> 1083.80]  until,
[1084.68 --> 1085.42]  what's the last part
[1085.42 --> 1085.90]  of the story?
[1087.96 --> 1089.18]  Jesus comes again.
[1089.74 --> 1090.44]  And every time,
[1090.54 --> 1090.82]  by the way,
[1090.84 --> 1091.56]  when I tell this part
[1091.56 --> 1091.90]  of the story,
[1091.96 --> 1092.54]  there's someone who says,
[1092.58 --> 1092.92]  Dave,
[1092.92 --> 1094.46]  the arrow should be going up
[1094.46 --> 1095.22]  like this.
[1095.58 --> 1095.84]  And I say,
[1095.90 --> 1096.40]  no, no, no.
[1096.74 --> 1097.54]  Revelation 21,
[1097.64 --> 1098.18]  what does it say?
[1099.14 --> 1099.74]  Then I looked
[1099.74 --> 1100.38]  and I saw
[1100.38 --> 1101.38]  a new heavens
[1101.38 --> 1102.84]  and a new earth.
[1103.78 --> 1104.82]  And God brings
[1104.82 --> 1106.00]  the new Jerusalem down
[1106.00 --> 1107.04]  so that people
[1107.04 --> 1108.98]  can live with resurrected bodies
[1108.98 --> 1110.64]  in a resurrected world.
[1111.60 --> 1112.66]  This is the story
[1112.66 --> 1113.06]  of the Bible
[1113.06 --> 1113.78]  told very,
[1113.86 --> 1114.08]  very,
[1114.16 --> 1114.72]  very briefly.
[1115.56 --> 1116.58]  Isn't that good news?
[1117.46 --> 1118.16]  And let me just tell you
[1118.16 --> 1118.54]  personally,
[1118.54 --> 1119.74]  when I first learned
[1119.74 --> 1120.26]  how the Bible
[1120.26 --> 1120.92]  fit together,
[1121.06 --> 1121.74]  it was a conversion
[1121.74 --> 1122.64]  experience for me.
[1122.92 --> 1123.62]  Because the cross
[1123.62 --> 1124.12]  of Jesus,
[1124.56 --> 1125.74]  I'd grown up with saying,
[1125.94 --> 1126.06]  yeah,
[1126.18 --> 1126.88]  this is the cross
[1126.88 --> 1127.86]  that forgives my sin.
[1127.98 --> 1128.66]  It sets me free.
[1128.90 --> 1129.22]  I realize,
[1129.42 --> 1130.02]  absolutely,
[1130.16 --> 1130.62]  that is true
[1130.62 --> 1131.06]  and good news.
[1131.26 --> 1131.68]  But it's about
[1131.68 --> 1132.84]  the whole creation.
[1134.02 --> 1135.02]  It's the whole creation.
[1136.34 --> 1136.60]  Now,
[1136.66 --> 1137.52]  going back to John,
[1138.24 --> 1139.00]  going back to Peter
[1139.00 --> 1139.66]  in the empty tomb,
[1140.30 --> 1141.22]  they're wrestling with it.
[1141.26 --> 1141.70]  They go back
[1141.70 --> 1142.20]  to the scriptures
[1142.20 --> 1142.72]  to understand
[1142.72 --> 1143.48]  what in the world
[1143.48 --> 1144.18]  it means that Jesus
[1144.18 --> 1144.82]  rose from the dead
[1144.82 --> 1145.26]  because they didn't
[1145.26 --> 1146.10]  understand why Jesus
[1146.10 --> 1146.94]  had to.
[1147.62 --> 1148.16]  And then John
[1148.16 --> 1148.98]  finally puts his pen
[1148.98 --> 1149.46]  to paper
[1149.46 --> 1151.14]  or quill
[1151.14 --> 1152.50]  to scroll,
[1152.72 --> 1153.22]  you should say.
[1153.98 --> 1154.80]  And how does he
[1154.80 --> 1155.52]  start his gospel?
[1155.52 --> 1157.08]  How does John
[1157.08 --> 1157.74]  start his gospel?
[1157.80 --> 1159.00]  Remember the fireworks passage?
[1161.04 --> 1162.86]  In the beginning.
[1164.00 --> 1164.88]  Doesn't that blow your mind?
[1165.16 --> 1165.80]  John says,
[1165.88 --> 1166.36]  right at the outset,
[1166.50 --> 1167.22]  I can't talk about
[1167.22 --> 1167.90]  the death and resurrection
[1167.90 --> 1169.04]  of Jesus without going,
[1169.44 --> 1170.08]  in the beginning
[1170.08 --> 1171.18]  was the Word.
[1171.44 --> 1172.62]  And the Word was with God
[1172.62 --> 1173.18]  and the Word
[1173.18 --> 1174.58]  was God.
[1174.92 --> 1175.66]  He was with God
[1175.66 --> 1176.22]  in the beginning.
[1176.40 --> 1176.84]  Through him,
[1177.32 --> 1178.20]  all things
[1178.20 --> 1179.16]  were made.
[1179.26 --> 1179.72]  Without him,
[1179.86 --> 1180.62]  nothing was made
[1180.62 --> 1181.40]  that has been made.
[1181.62 --> 1182.90]  In him was life.
[1182.90 --> 1184.26]  And that life
[1184.26 --> 1184.66]  was the light
[1184.66 --> 1185.26]  of all people.
[1185.94 --> 1186.68]  And then that phrase,
[1187.20 --> 1188.02]  the light shines
[1188.02 --> 1188.82]  in the darkness,
[1189.46 --> 1190.12]  but the darkness
[1190.12 --> 1191.14]  has not overcome it.
[1191.78 --> 1192.06]  Do you see
[1192.06 --> 1192.70]  what John's doing?
[1193.48 --> 1194.34]  John is placing
[1194.34 --> 1194.92]  the event
[1194.92 --> 1195.62]  of Jesus' death
[1195.62 --> 1196.10]  and resurrection,
[1196.24 --> 1197.68]  this huge worldwide
[1197.68 --> 1198.86]  event in the context
[1198.86 --> 1199.78]  of the true story
[1199.78 --> 1200.30]  of the whole world
[1200.30 --> 1201.46]  saying it starts
[1201.46 --> 1202.16]  with creation.
[1202.98 --> 1203.76]  It starts with
[1203.76 --> 1205.08]  God's redeeming work
[1205.08 --> 1205.60]  and it ends
[1205.60 --> 1206.94]  with a new creation.
[1207.32 --> 1207.88]  And what he wants
[1207.88 --> 1208.54]  everyone to know
[1208.54 --> 1209.26]  is what Christ
[1209.26 --> 1209.96]  has done here
[1209.96 --> 1211.26]  deals with the parasite
[1211.26 --> 1212.56]  of sin so that we can
[1212.56 --> 1213.14]  live the way
[1213.14 --> 1213.70]  we were created
[1213.70 --> 1214.66]  to live with God,
[1215.54 --> 1216.32]  with others,
[1216.80 --> 1217.56]  with creation,
[1217.86 --> 1219.26]  and even with ourselves.
[1221.42 --> 1222.76]  That's a big gospel.
[1226.26 --> 1227.52]  To put it a different way,
[1228.38 --> 1229.38]  when John wrestles
[1229.38 --> 1230.10]  with the significance
[1230.10 --> 1230.72]  of the resurrection,
[1230.90 --> 1231.46]  I think what he
[1231.46 --> 1232.02]  and the other
[1232.02 --> 1232.88]  biblical writers learn
[1232.88 --> 1233.86]  is this is not just
[1233.86 --> 1234.88]  a story about a person
[1234.88 --> 1235.82]  coming back to life,
[1236.22 --> 1237.02]  although that's true.
[1237.24 --> 1237.96]  This is not just
[1237.96 --> 1238.50]  the story about
[1238.50 --> 1239.24]  the Son of God
[1239.24 --> 1240.50]  rising over the power
[1240.50 --> 1240.76]  of death.
[1240.76 --> 1241.62]  This is about
[1241.62 --> 1242.34]  the Son of God
[1242.34 --> 1244.18]  bringing resurrection life
[1244.18 --> 1245.26]  to the whole of his world.
[1246.42 --> 1247.08]  This is about,
[1247.16 --> 1248.04]  as one person puts it,
[1248.22 --> 1248.90]  the resurrection
[1248.90 --> 1250.36]  of the entire creation.
[1251.64 --> 1252.72]  This whole story
[1252.72 --> 1253.40]  is about resurrection
[1253.40 --> 1254.22]  and it finishes
[1254.22 --> 1255.22]  with us getting
[1255.22 --> 1256.14]  resurrected bodies
[1256.14 --> 1257.40]  in a resurrected world
[1257.40 --> 1258.04]  to enjoy
[1258.04 --> 1258.70]  as it was meant
[1258.70 --> 1259.20]  to be enjoyed
[1259.20 --> 1260.64]  from the very beginning.
[1260.74 --> 1261.78]  And it's all because
[1261.78 --> 1263.62]  Jesus rose from the dead.
[1264.62 --> 1265.54]  And I can't help
[1265.54 --> 1266.24]  but think when John
[1266.24 --> 1266.84]  looks back over
[1266.84 --> 1267.56]  Jesus' life,
[1268.18 --> 1269.02]  the passage
[1269.02 --> 1269.90]  or the moment,
[1269.90 --> 1270.46]  I should say,
[1270.46 --> 1271.28]  that couldn't
[1271.28 --> 1272.02]  leave his mind
[1272.02 --> 1273.48]  is also the story
[1273.48 --> 1274.18]  of Jesus raising
[1274.18 --> 1275.06]  Lazarus from the dead.
[1275.18 --> 1275.70]  We preached on this
[1275.70 --> 1276.52]  just a few weeks ago.
[1277.20 --> 1277.52]  And Jesus,
[1277.64 --> 1278.42]  before he does it,
[1278.46 --> 1279.72]  he's arguing with Martha.
[1280.26 --> 1281.12]  Martha's upset with him
[1281.12 --> 1281.94]  because he didn't show up
[1281.94 --> 1282.34]  early enough
[1282.34 --> 1283.40]  and therefore Lazarus died.
[1283.68 --> 1284.40]  And Martha believed
[1284.40 --> 1284.88]  in the resurrection
[1284.88 --> 1285.82]  on the last day.
[1286.04 --> 1287.20]  And then Jesus stops her.
[1287.28 --> 1287.48]  He says,
[1287.64 --> 1287.96]  Martha,
[1288.52 --> 1290.82]  I am the resurrection.
[1291.92 --> 1293.60]  I am the resurrection.
[1293.74 --> 1294.58]  This is not an event.
[1294.70 --> 1295.28]  This is not just
[1295.28 --> 1295.92]  something in the future.
[1295.92 --> 1297.56]  This is a person.
[1298.44 --> 1299.98]  Resurrection is a person.
[1300.38 --> 1300.56]  He says,
[1300.64 --> 1301.24]  I'm the resurrection
[1301.24 --> 1302.60]  and the life.
[1303.88 --> 1304.50]  And what matters
[1304.50 --> 1305.72]  so much to John,
[1306.02 --> 1306.54]  and this is me
[1306.54 --> 1307.48]  preaching to us now,
[1307.92 --> 1308.86]  is that believers,
[1309.02 --> 1309.54]  anyone who reads
[1309.54 --> 1310.28]  this gospel says,
[1310.58 --> 1311.60]  I want to take hold
[1311.60 --> 1312.40]  of that resurrection
[1312.40 --> 1313.22]  by faith.
[1314.02 --> 1314.88]  I want to believe
[1314.88 --> 1316.02]  that Jesus is life.
[1316.14 --> 1316.60]  And then,
[1317.06 --> 1317.80]  one of John's favorite
[1317.80 --> 1318.50]  things to talk about
[1318.50 --> 1319.46]  is we get fellowship
[1319.46 --> 1320.00]  with Jesus
[1320.00 --> 1321.64]  and what's true for him
[1321.64 --> 1322.54]  becomes true for us.
[1322.66 --> 1323.50]  We get that resurrection
[1323.50 --> 1324.82]  life in us.
[1325.60 --> 1326.64]  We get to live
[1326.64 --> 1327.94]  in that resurrection.
[1329.62 --> 1329.88]  You know,
[1331.12 --> 1332.44]  when Paul struggles
[1332.44 --> 1333.42]  through what in the world
[1333.42 --> 1334.52]  this means in his own way,
[1334.66 --> 1335.00]  and remember,
[1335.12 --> 1335.90]  all the biblical writers
[1335.90 --> 1336.62]  had to make sense
[1336.62 --> 1337.28]  of what in the world
[1337.28 --> 1338.14]  the resurrection meant.
[1338.52 --> 1339.42]  When Paul struggled through,
[1339.48 --> 1340.24]  he says this in Romans
[1340.24 --> 1341.26]  and he says it in Ephesians,
[1341.54 --> 1342.10]  what's so striking,
[1342.24 --> 1342.56]  he says,
[1342.94 --> 1343.16]  you know,
[1343.24 --> 1344.22]  the same power
[1344.22 --> 1345.46]  that rose Christ
[1345.46 --> 1345.80]  from the dead,
[1345.84 --> 1346.62]  the same power
[1346.62 --> 1347.98]  is now at work
[1347.98 --> 1348.52]  in the church.
[1349.28 --> 1350.02]  And that's Paul's way
[1350.02 --> 1350.28]  of saying,
[1350.42 --> 1351.30]  as people take hold
[1351.30 --> 1351.66]  of Jesus,
[1351.76 --> 1352.48]  as they believe in him,
[1352.52 --> 1353.10]  as they trust him,
[1353.10 --> 1354.26]  as they do what John did
[1354.26 --> 1355.26]  and all the earliest disciples
[1355.26 --> 1356.16]  and all the generations
[1356.16 --> 1357.02]  of believers before us,
[1357.26 --> 1358.40]  they gain access
[1358.40 --> 1360.62]  to that resurrection life
[1360.62 --> 1361.52]  already now.
[1362.42 --> 1363.36]  Or to use the language
[1363.36 --> 1364.48]  I often like to use,
[1365.76 --> 1367.22]  is this life to come,
[1367.50 --> 1368.24]  the resurrection life,
[1368.30 --> 1369.64]  now breaks into the present.
[1370.24 --> 1371.00]  And you can see
[1371.00 --> 1371.68]  what's coming
[1371.68 --> 1373.08]  in the church already.
[1374.20 --> 1375.20]  There's a day coming
[1375.20 --> 1376.08]  when people will live
[1376.08 --> 1376.44]  in unity.
[1377.40 --> 1378.38]  We experience that
[1378.38 --> 1379.38]  by living in unity now.
[1379.48 --> 1379.78]  In fact,
[1379.90 --> 1380.26]  who is here
[1380.26 --> 1381.28]  at the Good Friday service?
[1381.78 --> 1382.88]  At the Good Friday service,
[1383.28 --> 1384.20]  the pastor who preached,
[1384.36 --> 1384.94]  Pastor John,
[1385.24 --> 1385.68]  he started,
[1385.96 --> 1386.16]  I mean,
[1386.20 --> 1387.06]  the worship was amazing,
[1387.16 --> 1387.80]  10 different churches.
[1388.20 --> 1388.76]  And John said,
[1388.82 --> 1389.04]  you know,
[1389.12 --> 1389.80]  when I hear worship
[1389.80 --> 1391.12]  like that from 10 different churches,
[1391.54 --> 1392.84]  I think foretaste.
[1393.88 --> 1394.72]  Foretaste of the worship
[1394.72 --> 1395.34]  that's to come.
[1396.38 --> 1397.06]  But the church,
[1397.18 --> 1398.16]  as the resurrection of life,
[1398.22 --> 1399.18]  breaks into the present,
[1399.26 --> 1400.12]  it becomes to live
[1400.12 --> 1401.22]  and demonstrate unity,
[1401.74 --> 1402.10]  love,
[1402.46 --> 1402.78]  grace,
[1402.94 --> 1403.24]  forgiveness,
[1403.36 --> 1403.84]  in our marriages,
[1404.04 --> 1404.70]  in our workplaces,
[1404.92 --> 1405.58]  in our friendship,
[1405.68 --> 1406.30]  and all the rest,
[1406.42 --> 1407.32]  in such a way that's like,
[1407.48 --> 1408.16]  this is how
[1408.16 --> 1409.70]  we were created to live.
[1410.56 --> 1411.90]  We're already tasting it now
[1411.90 --> 1413.64]  by the resurrection power of Jesus
[1413.64 --> 1415.12]  poured into our hearts
[1415.12 --> 1415.96]  by the Holy Spirit.
[1416.74 --> 1417.52]  Is that making sense?
[1419.52 --> 1421.22]  I went into full whiteboard mode there.
[1423.34 --> 1425.56]  And John's invitation to all of us is,
[1426.30 --> 1426.80]  believe it.
[1427.56 --> 1428.62]  Believe that it happened,
[1428.80 --> 1429.86]  believe that the power is yours,
[1430.04 --> 1431.04]  believe that the creation
[1431.04 --> 1431.78]  will be made new
[1431.78 --> 1432.58]  because of Jesus
[1432.58 --> 1433.70]  emptying the tomb
[1433.70 --> 1434.84]  by the power of God.
[1434.84 --> 1437.16]  And I was going to preach
[1437.16 --> 1437.80]  for a little longer
[1437.80 --> 1438.70]  on the mission of the church
[1438.70 --> 1439.46]  to make this known,
[1439.74 --> 1440.34]  but then I found out
[1440.34 --> 1441.10]  that Elise Cruz
[1441.10 --> 1442.46]  is going to sing a song
[1442.46 --> 1443.28]  that basically says
[1443.28 --> 1443.96]  more eloquently
[1443.96 --> 1445.60]  and nicer with music
[1445.60 --> 1446.56]  what I was going to preach on.
[1446.80 --> 1447.72]  So I'm going to finish
[1447.72 --> 1448.58]  my sermon this morning
[1448.58 --> 1449.54]  by allowing us to listen
[1449.54 --> 1451.02]  Elise play a song
[1451.02 --> 1451.90]  called The Commission
[1451.90 --> 1452.84]  by Cain.
[1452.88 --> 1453.92]  Let's take in this together.
[1453.92 --> 1453.96]  Let's take in this together.
[1453.96 --> 1483.94]  Let's take in this together.
