[0.00 --> 4.84]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[5.34 --> 7.52]  It is good to gather around the Scriptures this morning.
[8.36 --> 13.00]  We didn't mention the offering, but I just want to say there's two ways you can give, at least.
[13.52 --> 14.98]  One is through our Church Center app.
[15.02 --> 17.16]  And if you're new to our church and this is your new church family,
[17.68 --> 21.14]  that app is very helpful because it has a directory so you can contact people.
[21.22 --> 23.40]  It has all the information on ministries and how to get connected.
[23.74 --> 25.20]  And it's also how you can give.
[25.86 --> 29.14]  If you'd like to give with a debit machine, there is one out back.
[29.14 --> 32.56]  And I'm reminded of what an African friend said to me not that long ago.
[32.66 --> 34.02]  Worship is not what you get.
[34.12 --> 35.18]  It is what you bring.
[35.92 --> 39.48]  And one of the ways we give and we serve with our resources is through our tithes.
[40.90 --> 43.14]  Well, as you can see, we're starting a new sermon series.
[43.22 --> 46.22]  And before I say any more, I want to just highlight all this art that's up here.
[46.62 --> 48.44]  We have this thing called a Hope Art Collective.
[49.04 --> 52.30]  And we basically send them some of our notes for what we're doing for our series.
[52.38 --> 53.70]  And they go to work on beautiful art.
[53.84 --> 57.04]  So I don't know who did all of it, but I know Julie Bintol did that.
[57.04 --> 58.74]  Colette did that.
[59.16 --> 60.04]  And Patty did that.
[60.12 --> 61.90]  I think I got them confused in the 9 a.m. service.
[62.28 --> 62.42]  Yeah.
[62.78 --> 63.26]  Patty did.
[63.34 --> 63.94]  Someone's pointing it.
[64.00 --> 64.70]  Patty did that one.
[64.76 --> 65.26]  Colette did that one.
[65.28 --> 65.74]  It's beautiful.
[66.34 --> 71.40]  Come take a look at how they're sort of expressing and articulating in art the unity of the church.
[73.20 --> 76.76]  We had it in our minds for a number of months now to do a sermon series on unity.
[77.10 --> 80.48]  And you'll remember even when we were preaching our way through the Gospel of John,
[80.56 --> 83.66]  we had people write their prayers for unity in the church.
[83.72 --> 86.02]  And when we saw those, we're like, okay, that solidifies for us.
[86.02 --> 89.64]  We want to do a sermon series on unity for the next five weeks and lean into what it is
[89.64 --> 93.64]  that Christ says by His Word about how we are to be one body as believers.
[94.88 --> 98.22]  If you have your Bible, turn with me to Philippians chapter 1.
[98.62 --> 101.46]  And we're going to read that together starting at verse 27.
[102.66 --> 104.14]  Philippians 1 verse 27.
[104.14 --> 109.14]  Philippians 2 verse 27.
[109.14 --> 119.54]  Whatever happens as citizens of heaven live in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ,
[120.24 --> 124.42]  then whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you
[124.42 --> 129.92]  stand firm in the one spirit, striving together with one accord for the faith of the gospel,
[130.38 --> 135.36]  without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that
[135.36 --> 140.72]  they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved, and that by God. For it has been granted to you on
[140.72 --> 146.14]  behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but to suffer for him, since you are going through the
[146.14 --> 153.26]  same struggle you saw I had, and now here I still have. Therefore, if you have any encouragement from
[153.26 --> 159.72]  being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in his spirit,
[159.72 --> 167.04]  if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same
[167.04 --> 174.04]  love, being one in spirit and one mind, do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather,
[174.20 --> 179.80]  in humility, value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests, but each of you
[179.80 --> 191.02]  to the interests of others. Well, friends, I want to start with a scene that you can imagine with me.
[191.56 --> 197.06]  I want you to imagine a scene where there's a young family of four. Parents are in their early 40s.
[197.10 --> 202.28]  They've got two young kids, both in middle school, a boy and a girl. And there's a season where they
[202.28 --> 207.14]  decided as a family, you know what, we want to adopt a child into our family. We want to bring a child
[207.14 --> 213.08]  into our home. So they go through the long process of adoption. And finally, as a family, they get in
[213.08 --> 217.54]  the car and they take a drive to an adoption agency, and they're going to have a conversation about
[217.54 --> 223.96]  bringing a child into their family. They go to the orphanage. And on the way there, the boy and the girl
[223.96 --> 228.92]  in the back seat, they start fighting. The boy makes a name to the girl, and the girl responds in kind,
[228.98 --> 233.02]  and they start yelling at each other. And the parents are trying to slow them down. They're also tense
[233.02 --> 237.20]  by what's happening. And they start getting into a fight themselves about their home, its size,
[237.26 --> 240.46]  and how bringing another child is going to make some complex things about their future and their
[240.46 --> 246.06]  finances. It's a heated car ride. They get to the parking lot of the orphanage, and they walk into
[246.06 --> 250.94]  the building, but the kids start fighting again. And they start calling each other names as they walk
[250.94 --> 254.82]  down the hallway towards the office where they're going to have a conversation about adoption.
[256.26 --> 260.16]  And right before they get into the office, the dad looks back at his two kids fighting,
[260.16 --> 265.36]  and he yells at them. He says, that's enough. We want to bring a child into a good home.
[266.64 --> 273.82]  You can feel the tension there, right? You can feel the irony there. That story is a story about the
[273.82 --> 281.10]  church. A family that's on the way to the orphanage to bring people into the family that is too busy
[281.10 --> 286.94]  fighting with itself to even wonder, will this child want to come into this family?
[286.94 --> 293.48]  Now, we've all got our stories, I think, of ways we've experienced church conflict. I'm guessing
[293.48 --> 297.40]  there's even people who aren't here because of church conflict. Family members who said, you know
[297.40 --> 302.92]  what? I'm done with church. It's too divisive, too polarizing, too much infighting, right? I still
[302.92 --> 309.80]  remember my first memory of conflict in the church. I was 12 years old, maybe 13. I moved from piano to
[309.80 --> 313.32]  the drums, and I wanted to play drums in church, not even realizing that that would be the time people
[313.32 --> 318.28]  described as, quote, the worship wars. Maybe some of you remember those. And I remember my uncle, who
[318.28 --> 322.44]  was an elder at the time, I was telling him that I wanted to play drums in church, and he said to me,
[322.48 --> 327.40]  he's like, you know what, Dave? You go buy the drums. I'm going to donate the drums because if it goes
[327.40 --> 332.30]  through the elders, it's going to cause tons of division. My 12-year-old self was like, what's going
[332.30 --> 337.68]  on here? And of course, when I played drums in the church, then I saw the division. That's how church goes.
[337.68 --> 343.58]  Even a number of years ago, when I was doing my ordination to become a pastor, I had to read this
[343.58 --> 348.48]  book, which gets a C- for artistic beauty. It needs the Hope Art Collective to do a rewrite,
[349.32 --> 353.48]  but you can't see the title from there. But the title of the book that summarizes the history of
[353.48 --> 360.74]  the Christian Reformed Church coming into Canada is Family Quirrels. Think about that. The writers,
[361.02 --> 365.08]  Elton Bruins and Robert Swieringa, they did a summary of the history of the CRC,
[365.08 --> 371.70]  and the word that describes the history is quarrels. I mean, that's a sobering statement.
[372.68 --> 375.46]  And maybe you think, oh, that's the stuff of the past. But let me ask you this question.
[375.86 --> 379.96]  When the church historians write the story about the church during COVID, the church in the last
[379.96 --> 384.38]  two years, don't you think they'll have to use a similar word? It doesn't even matter the denomination.
[385.74 --> 391.42]  We know how to fight in the church. We know how to cause division in the church. And let me just name
[391.42 --> 396.52]  just a few things that sort of have caused tension and division over the last number of years.
[397.66 --> 402.46]  COVID. Just hearing that word makes you think of the tension you have with family members.
[402.90 --> 409.56]  Black Lives Matter, Human Sexuality Report, SOGI, trucker convoys, vaccination passports.
[409.86 --> 414.48]  I can keep going. And maybe you're thinking of the people right now who you're like, oh, man,
[414.48 --> 419.24]  I feel it. And don't worry, they're thinking the same thing about you.
[421.36 --> 426.50]  In this series, we want to look at what the scriptures say about unity. We want to hear what
[426.50 --> 433.52]  Christ by his word has for the church today about what it means to be a united family in him.
[435.56 --> 439.66]  It's a topic where I think we need to realize its significance. And I'll say this more than once in
[439.66 --> 444.26]  the series, but the unity of the church is, number one, a statement about the reconciling power of
[444.26 --> 449.68]  the gospel. It's a statement about the gospel. Number two, it's a measure of the health of the
[449.68 --> 455.54]  church. And number three, as we open up with the illustration, it directly impacts our mission
[455.54 --> 460.76]  and our evangelism in an already fractured, divided world. What more? What is different that we're
[460.76 --> 464.48]  bringing when the church is fighting into a world that's already fighting, right?
[464.48 --> 470.38]  And I don't just want the series, I should say at the outset, to be a series where we're here and
[470.38 --> 474.58]  where we learn. I want this to be a doing series. A number of us have already been praying that as
[474.58 --> 479.42]  we hear these messages, as we engage the scriptures, we want to be people who actually hear it and we
[479.42 --> 485.06]  do something with it. We want to be reconciled. And as far as it is possible, in the places where
[485.06 --> 489.66]  there is division in our homes, in our church, in our community, we want to lean in and say,
[489.66 --> 498.50]  how is Christ calling me to be a peacemaker? How is Christ calling our family to lean into unity?
[500.32 --> 505.52]  And if Christ's prayer for the church in John 17 is true, it is still his prayer for the church
[505.52 --> 511.40]  that we be united. And why would we not think he wants to answer our prayer now for unity,
[511.94 --> 518.86]  reconciliation, and peace? It seems fitting as we start this series that we look at just a few
[518.86 --> 523.36]  scriptures on unity. And the reason I say this is because I have a hunch that in the church we often
[523.36 --> 528.88]  think the central things in the Bible are, you know, the gospel of Jesus, perhaps loving your
[528.88 --> 532.34]  neighbor, moral living. There's a whole sort of cluster of things that might come to your mind
[532.34 --> 538.72]  first, but not unity. And I want to suggest that unity is not some like side, secondary, or tertiary
[538.72 --> 543.82]  thing. It's a very central teaching in the Bible. So here's some, just a few passages, starting and
[543.82 --> 552.48]  finishing with the words of Jesus himself. First, blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be
[552.48 --> 559.32]  called children of God. Number two, this comes from Proverbs 6. This is a zinger. There are six
[559.32 --> 565.50]  things that the Lord hates, seven things that are detestable to Him. Does He have your attention?
[565.50 --> 574.16]  Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes,
[574.32 --> 579.88]  feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness that pours out lies, and a person who
[579.88 --> 586.48]  stirs up conflict in a community. You almost want to say which one of these does not belong because
[586.48 --> 591.46]  it's so heavy, but no, it's part of the list, including murder and lying, causing division in
[591.46 --> 596.66]  the community is detestable to the Lord. First Corinthians 1 verse 10, I appeal to you, brothers
[596.66 --> 601.50]  and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you
[601.50 --> 608.74]  say, and that there be no division among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.
[610.02 --> 616.20]  And finally, Jesus again in John 17, I pray also for those who will believe in me through their
[616.20 --> 621.44]  message, that is the message of His disciples, that all of them may be one Father, just as you are
[621.44 --> 629.24]  in me and I am in you. May they also be in us, and here it is, so that the world may believe that you
[629.24 --> 635.38]  have sent me. You see the connection there? The unity of the church leads to faithfulness in the world.
[636.92 --> 640.74]  The unity of the church is not a side issue. In fact, one of the books that we read in preparation
[640.74 --> 646.56]  for this sermon series, the very first chapter was just page after page after page of quotations in
[646.56 --> 655.80]  the scriptures about how seriously the Lord takes unity and how serious a threat division is. Like I
[655.80 --> 660.88]  said, unity is a statement about the reconciling power of the gospel. It is a measure of the health
[660.88 --> 667.30]  of the church, and it directly impacts our evangelism and mission in the world. Like the illustration,
[667.52 --> 670.30]  we don't want to be the fighting family as we walk through the orphanage.
[670.30 --> 676.84]  So let's take a look at what Philippians says about unity and about disunity. Look what Paul says
[676.84 --> 682.96]  first in Philippians 1 verse 27. He says, whatever happens, whatever happens, as citizens of heaven
[682.96 --> 688.40]  live in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Now that's a loaded statement. Here's the context.
[689.42 --> 693.70]  Philippi, the city where the church is located, very young church in a very growing city,
[694.16 --> 699.76]  Philippi is a colony of the big city of Rome. But Philippi is also a place where there's many
[699.76 --> 703.70]  Roman citizens. And the people who are Roman citizens living in Philippi, they want everyone
[703.70 --> 709.80]  to know that they have this thing as the prestigious citizenship of Rome. They talk a certain way,
[709.92 --> 714.16]  they dress a certain way, they act a certain way so that everyone, regardless of their background
[714.16 --> 720.60]  and citizenship, knows here are Roman citizens. You can tell just by looking at them, just by listening
[720.60 --> 725.80]  to them, you know the Romans. And Paul says to the church in this kind of city, he says, hey church,
[725.80 --> 733.78]  you have a deeper allegiance than your citizenship to Rome. You have a deeper belonging to a person.
[734.96 --> 739.90]  You are citizens of heaven. And here's the zinger, your conduct, your speech, the way you talk
[739.90 --> 746.20]  must be in line with the gospel of Christ. Rome can do what it wants. You're citizens of heaven.
[746.64 --> 753.22]  People there can be divided. You belong to Jesus and you must conduct yourself as someone who belongs
[753.22 --> 760.22]  to Jesus Christ. Now, I can't say definitively what Paul would say if he wrote this letter to Canada,
[760.70 --> 764.78]  to a church here in our city. But I have a feeling it might look very similar.
[766.44 --> 770.96]  Paul knows, or I should say Paul knows, I know, and many of you even right now are in the process
[770.96 --> 775.36]  of Canadian citizenship. It's a significant thing to have. It's a privilege to be a Canadian citizen.
[775.78 --> 778.96]  And there's all sorts of things that come with being part of Canadian culture.
[778.96 --> 783.46]  But I'll name one thing that most of us already are feeling right now, and that is the polarizing
[783.46 --> 789.56]  of our culture. That is the increasing divisiveness in our culture. And Paul would probably say to us,
[789.92 --> 796.26]  church, you have a deeper allegiance than your Canadian citizenship. You have a deeper belonging
[796.26 --> 801.56]  that goes way, way deeper than what it means to be Canadian. You belong to Jesus.
[801.56 --> 808.98]  And therefore, the way you talk, the way you act, the way you do your work in public, the way you text,
[809.10 --> 814.04]  the way you tweet, the way you operate on social media, all of that must be in keeping with and in
[814.04 --> 822.04]  accordance with the gospel of Christ. How's that going? Could it be said of the church right now that
[822.04 --> 829.12]  that is the case? I'll come back to that. The very next sentence Paul makes is about conflict,
[829.12 --> 830.94]  and I'll read it for you. He writes,
[831.02 --> 836.36]  stand firm in one spirit, striving together with one accord for the faith of the gospel,
[836.46 --> 841.20]  without being frightened by those who oppose you. Now, here's something interesting.
[842.24 --> 846.48]  Paul, who writes a letter, expects there to be conflict. In fact, in almost every church,
[846.56 --> 849.98]  probably every church that Paul plants, except for the ones that may be totally compromised,
[850.38 --> 855.62]  they all experience conflict. And the conflict that Paul's talking about is from the outside
[855.62 --> 860.30]  towards the church. Paul's expecting that there's going to be Romans, there's going to be Jewish
[860.30 --> 863.36]  people, there's going to be all sorts of people who look at the church, and they have issues with
[863.36 --> 869.38]  the church. They are hostile to the church, you know? Think of the book of 2 Peter. 1 and 2 Peter,
[869.44 --> 873.24]  I think, are just very powerful books for a lot of reasons. But one of them is there's active
[873.24 --> 878.20]  hostility and persecution against the church, active hostility. And the word of the church is,
[878.38 --> 883.36]  church, stay united. Do not buckle, do not bend, do not cave what you believe about Jesus
[883.36 --> 888.88]  and what He's accomplished. Together as one body, stand firm in faith and live the love of Christ
[888.88 --> 893.14]  in the midst of persecution. He's inviting the church to unity in the midst of conflict coming
[893.14 --> 897.94]  towards the church. But here's the problem in Philippi. It's not just that there's conflict
[897.94 --> 903.70]  outside the church, not just that there's persecution towards them, there's now division within the church.
[904.56 --> 909.76]  And that often happens. It often happens that as pressure comes to the church, as there's hostility
[909.76 --> 915.38]  and sort of just a sense of disunity coming towards the church, it actually creates division within the
[915.38 --> 919.28]  church. If you look at church history, what undoes churches almost all the time is either conflict
[919.28 --> 925.18]  and pressure against it, and then division within it. I remember reading not that long ago about
[925.18 --> 930.26]  missionaries. When missionaries go into various places in the world, what often undercuts the mission
[930.26 --> 934.72]  is not what they're doing in the community, it's that there's division in the camp. There's division
[934.72 --> 938.46]  between missionaries that undercuts the good work they're doing in sharing the gospel.
[939.76 --> 947.96]  Now, I want to notice with you what Paul says is the source of disunity in the Philippian church.
[948.76 --> 952.50]  He says there's two things that are causing division in the church. Do you know what they are?
[952.54 --> 958.98]  Did you notice them in the passage? Chapter 2, verse 3, they are selfish ambition, vain conceit.
[959.54 --> 961.66]  Let me read for you what he writes in chapter 2, 3.
[961.66 --> 968.56]  Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility, value others above yourselves,
[969.00 --> 973.50]  not looking to your own interests, but each of you to the interests of others.
[974.32 --> 980.06]  Now, that's an interesting diagnosis on church disunity. And I want to make sort of a qualification
[980.06 --> 986.34]  that we'll come back to in this series. There are times in church where there's necessary division.
[986.34 --> 991.40]  There are times in church history where there had to be leaders who stand up and say,
[991.68 --> 996.44]  this is false teaching that's dividing the church that needs to be addressed. In fact, Paul does that.
[996.48 --> 1000.96]  There's people in Thessalonians, I believe, who deny the resurrection. And Paul's like, wait a minute,
[1001.08 --> 1005.64]  that's very central. We need to, as leaders, say that's not what we believe, that's not who we are,
[1005.70 --> 1008.66]  and therefore, this division, this false teaching needs to be dealt with.
[1008.66 --> 1014.60]  And if you want to geek out on church history, you can just look up on Wikipedia, the seven ecumenical councils.
[1015.38 --> 1020.80]  There are seven times as the church sort of went through different ages where there were significant heresies
[1020.80 --> 1025.52]  that come up in the church. Heresies where people would say, you know, I think Jesus was created,
[1025.92 --> 1029.78]  and He's not one with the Father. He's sort of a lower being than Jesus. And the church leaders would have to say,
[1029.88 --> 1035.50]  no, that's not who we are, that's not what we believe. That teaching needs to be dealt with and resisted.
[1035.50 --> 1042.26]  So division is often, not often, it is sometimes a necessary thing to protect the good truth of the gospel.
[1043.28 --> 1047.74]  But that is not the story of the Philippian church. That's not what's going on there. Paul says,
[1047.94 --> 1053.08]  the reason for your disunity, the reason for your division is ambition that is selfish and conceited
[1053.08 --> 1057.66]  hearts. It's ego people who are like, you know what, I want this to be about what I want,
[1057.78 --> 1062.48]  and I'm not concerned about what they want. That's what Paul says is the issue in the Philippian church.
[1062.48 --> 1067.54]  He's just calling them to task, saying, I know why you're divided, and it has to do with your
[1067.54 --> 1074.22]  selfishness. Now, let me ask you, would Paul not say the same thing to churches today?
[1075.72 --> 1080.80]  That so much division in the church is not over central pieces of the gospel,
[1081.62 --> 1088.06]  but over things that come as selfishness. And I've seen this, how often there's a really important
[1088.06 --> 1093.12]  thing that people are arguing about, but then it becomes very personal. And then I attack you,
[1093.18 --> 1097.22]  and you attack me, and we're in this personal attack, and we're no longer thinking, hey, how can I
[1097.22 --> 1102.14]  listen? How can I be present in the midst of this? How can I bless others, even in a difficult situation?
[1102.38 --> 1108.54]  But now it's, how can I win? How can I be right? How can I denounce them and protect myself? And now
[1108.54 --> 1113.54]  we've got into the territory of this passage. And it happens in all of our hearts. I mean,
[1113.54 --> 1119.66]  selfishness is such an insidious sin. Selfishness is something we can cloak in such good things,
[1119.82 --> 1124.38]  pastors included. And we need to recognize that this insidiousness leads us to a place where we
[1124.38 --> 1129.90]  move from wanting to serve, wanting to bless, wanting to listen, wanting to care, to wanting
[1129.90 --> 1136.78]  ourself to be at the center, our ego to be protected. And Paul has these specific words for
[1136.78 --> 1143.82]  the church in that situation. He says, rather in humility, value others above yourselves,
[1144.18 --> 1150.38]  not looking to your own interest, but each of you to the interest of others. That is how
[1150.38 --> 1155.50]  relationships are supposed to go in the kingdom of God. That's how the upside-down kingdom operates.
[1155.96 --> 1160.92]  Rome may fight, Rome may have quarrels, Rome may have all sorts of divisions, but in the church of Jesus,
[1160.92 --> 1169.40]  the posture that Christ leads his church into is humility that leads to listening, to serving,
[1169.88 --> 1179.88]  to hearing, and not attacking. So how's it going? How's it going for you specifically in those places
[1179.88 --> 1186.96]  of conflict with that family member who has very different opinions on politics, with that family
[1186.96 --> 1192.20]  member who has very different opinions on COVID, with that family member who you haven't talked to
[1192.20 --> 1198.44]  for a while because the last conversation was explosive? Could it be said of you in that
[1198.44 --> 1206.02]  conversation that you in humility considered others better than yourselves, that you valued them above
[1206.02 --> 1215.94]  yourself? Or more pointedly, could it be said of us as a church, they lived in a manner worthy of the
[1215.94 --> 1223.72]  gospel of Christ? They spoke, they acted, they responded, they texted, they posted on social media in a way
[1223.72 --> 1231.10]  that is worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Could that be said of us in the places of conflict over the last
[1231.10 --> 1240.62]  two years? That's worth reflecting on. More than that, I think this passage invites us to serious self-diagnosis
[1240.62 --> 1247.20]  and even auditing our last set of emails with someone we're in conflict with, our last set of texts,
[1247.40 --> 1253.50]  our last conversation around the dinner room table. Was it true for us that humility and selflessness
[1253.50 --> 1259.76]  and looking to the needs of others was present? Because church, that's exactly what this passage is about.
[1260.54 --> 1263.90]  And what's true for Philippi is true for us.
[1263.90 --> 1274.38]  I want the last few minutes of this passage to be seen as encouragement and hope. You'll notice I
[1274.38 --> 1278.38]  jumped over what I think is the best part of this passage. In fact, this is a part of Brittany and my
[1278.38 --> 1282.96]  wedding passage and a lady in our former church where we got married, she embroidered this on a
[1282.96 --> 1287.80]  giant piece of art that's in our room. And so this passage is one that means a lot to me. And this is what it
[1287.80 --> 1288.20]  says,
[1288.20 --> 1315.26]  Did you hear the motivation that Paul gives for unity? That right there, that little packed statement
[1315.26 --> 1321.68]  was Paul saying, here's why you church should want unity. This isn't just a have to. This is
[1321.68 --> 1327.86]  something you want to desire. There are three specific things. Number one, they are united with
[1327.86 --> 1334.00]  Christ. Number two, they have received the love of Christ, the comfort of that love. And number three,
[1334.30 --> 1339.10]  they share in the life of the Spirit. Those are significant things. Let me put it in different words.
[1339.10 --> 1346.54]  I think Paul is saying here, church, don't you ever forget what Jesus has done for you. Don't you ever
[1346.54 --> 1352.36]  forget that Christ, by His grace on the cross, has reached into your rebellious life, into your arrogant
[1352.36 --> 1359.02]  life, into your divisive tendencies, and He grafted you into His family. Do you know that, church? And he's
[1359.02 --> 1364.38]  saying, don't you ever forget you've been united with Christ, and it's not because of you. It's because of
[1364.38 --> 1370.30]  Jesus. Secondly, you've received the comfort of His love. Christ did not have to give His affection
[1370.30 --> 1377.04]  to rebellious people like the church, like you and me. He chose to. And even to this day, in His grace
[1377.04 --> 1384.98]  and mercy, He gives us the comfort of His love. Think about that. And thirdly, Paul's saying, have you
[1384.98 --> 1391.62]  forgotten that He gave you His Spirit? Have you forgotten that the very life of Jesus, the very power
[1391.62 --> 1397.68]  that raised Him from the dead is now not just around you, but it dwells in you? Do you know what
[1397.68 --> 1403.10]  He's given you, church? That's Paul's message. And he says, if that's true, if it's true that He's united
[1403.10 --> 1407.04]  with you with Christ, if it's true that you have the comfort of love, if it's true that you have the
[1407.04 --> 1415.96]  fellowship of the Spirit, it must change the way you live with each other. It must change the way you
[1415.96 --> 1421.98]  speak. It must change the way you act. It must change the way you listen and post on social media.
[1422.94 --> 1430.66]  Church, it must be true for us. Otherwise, as one writer puts it very strongly, something is wrong
[1430.66 --> 1438.00]  with what we believe about Jesus Christ. It shouldn't surprise any of us that the next number of verses,
[1438.18 --> 1444.46]  after inviting unity in the church, resisting selfish ambition and vain conceit, what does Paul talk about
[1444.46 --> 1449.96]  for the next number of verses? Jesus. In fact, I'm actually going to read this passage. It's not on
[1449.96 --> 1454.60]  the screen. This is also part of my wedding passage. This is what Paul says, in your relationships with
[1454.60 --> 1460.86]  one another have the same attitude, the same mind as Christ Jesus had, who, being in the very nature God,
[1461.10 --> 1468.38]  did not consider equality with God something to be used to His own advantage. Rather, He made Himself
[1468.38 --> 1475.08]  nothing by taking the very nature of a servant or a slave in the Greek. Being made in human likeness
[1475.08 --> 1480.76]  and being found in appearance as a human being, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient to death,
[1481.12 --> 1487.74]  even death on the cross. Therefore, God exalted Him to the highest place, gave Him the name that's
[1487.74 --> 1492.74]  above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the
[1492.74 --> 1498.40]  earth and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of the Father.
[1499.96 --> 1507.38]  You know what He's doing there? He's saying, church, look at Jesus. He was in the very nature God
[1507.38 --> 1515.58]  and He lowered Himself and lowered Himself and lowered Himself and was obedient to death, the lowest,
[1515.72 --> 1520.22]  most humiliating death on the cross for the sake of a rebellious world that rejected Him as King.
[1520.22 --> 1528.54]  And Paul says, if that's Jesus, that's our model. If self-emptying self, lowering self, giving love
[1528.54 --> 1535.54]  is Jesus, that must also be the church. And what I think Paul is saying in this passage, to put it very
[1535.54 --> 1542.08]  simply, is the cross is what humbles the church. We don't deserve it. And the cross is what unites the
[1542.08 --> 1548.02]  church. As we look at the cross, we are brought together as a family made whole by the grace of Jesus.
[1550.22 --> 1554.96]  Let me read for you a quote from Tim Chester. We've read this in our surge group with a number
[1554.96 --> 1558.32]  of people over the years. It's in a book called You Can Change. And I've always liked that title,
[1558.66 --> 1561.34]  You Can Change. This is what he writes,
[1561.34 --> 1566.02]  There is only one thing I know of that crushes me to the ground and humbles me to the dust,
[1566.02 --> 1572.30]  and that is to look at the Son of God and especially contemplate the cross. Nothing less
[1572.30 --> 1581.32]  can do it. When I see that I am a sinner, that nothing but the Son of God and the cross can save me,
[1581.32 --> 1588.52]  I am humbled to the dust. Nothing cultivates humility like the cross.
[1590.36 --> 1593.60]  In fact, one of my very favorite memories of being a youth pastor
[1593.60 --> 1600.08]  is having, we had a Good Friday service in the evening once. At the end of the Good Friday service,
[1600.16 --> 1604.12]  we did for years and years, we invited people to leave in silence and whoever wanted to pray in front
[1604.12 --> 1608.02]  of the cross could do so. And one of the young adults that I spent a lot of time with, who I mentored
[1608.02 --> 1612.52]  a lot, who had a lot of struggles in his life and would probably be okay with me saying, he had a fair
[1612.52 --> 1617.90]  bit of pride. I remember him staying for another half hour, kneeling himself in front of the cross
[1617.90 --> 1623.22]  and weeping. And I saw with my own eyes, and I've experienced this in my own life, that sense of like,
[1623.26 --> 1630.44]  when you see the cross, when you really engage what's happened in the cross for us, it crushes us
[1630.44 --> 1637.08]  to the ground. Your pride has no place in front of the cross. Your arrogance has no place in front of
[1637.08 --> 1642.26]  the cross. Your divisive tendency has no place in front of the cross. And Jesus, who lowered himself,
[1642.42 --> 1651.04]  says, follow me. Follow me in self-emptying love. Follow me in giving yourself away for the sake of others.
[1651.54 --> 1659.16]  This is the path for the church. It is the cross that humbles us, and it will ultimately always be the cross
[1659.16 --> 1662.60]  that unites us. Let's pray.
[1670.94 --> 1676.54]  Father, we thank you for your word, which comforts us and it challenges us.
[1676.54 --> 1682.20]  And we pray that you, by your spirit, would do your work in us, whatever it is that we are holding
[1682.20 --> 1687.00]  in our own hearts, whether it's resentment, whether it's anger, whether it's grief, whether it's the pain
[1687.00 --> 1692.62]  of broken relationships. Lord, would you do your work by your spirit? Would you make us peacemakers?
[1693.80 --> 1701.52]  Would you make us one? Would you give us the very humility of Jesus so that we could live as servants
[1701.52 --> 1706.98]  who will lower ourselves for the sake of our neighbor and for the sake of our world? Amen.
