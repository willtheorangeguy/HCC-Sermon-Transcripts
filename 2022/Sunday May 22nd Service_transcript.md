[0.00 --> 4.02]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[4.74 --> 7.28]  I just have to say, it is a gift to come to church,
[7.40 --> 9.94]  and it's actually sunny outside, don't you think?
[10.02 --> 11.18]  First sunny Sunday in May.
[12.36 --> 14.58]  We're going to gather around the Scriptures this morning
[14.58 --> 17.04]  and continue our series, That They May Be One,
[17.26 --> 19.48]  where we are exploring what it is that Christ has to say
[19.48 --> 22.26]  about the unity of the church by His Word.
[22.36 --> 25.46]  So if you have your Bible, turn with me to Ephesians 4.
[25.86 --> 27.56]  And before I read it, I'll just summarize.
[27.56 --> 30.06]  For those of you who may not have been here last week,
[30.70 --> 32.62]  we looked at last week at Philippians,
[32.94 --> 34.46]  and we made three statements about unity.
[34.56 --> 36.22]  We said, number one, unity is a statement
[36.22 --> 38.14]  about the reconciling power of the gospel.
[39.00 --> 41.54]  Number two, unity is a measure of the health of the church.
[41.60 --> 45.72]  And number three, unity directly impacts our witness
[45.72 --> 48.88]  and our evangelism in a divided, fractured world.
[49.78 --> 52.64]  Paul confronted selfish ambition and vain conceit,
[52.94 --> 54.24]  invited the church into humility,
[54.84 --> 56.48]  and now we get to hear how Paul's going to address
[56.48 --> 57.64]  a different church in Ephesus
[57.64 --> 60.48]  that is also experiencing conflict and disunity.
[60.64 --> 61.94]  So turn with me to Ephesians 4.
[62.26 --> 63.98]  We're going to read verse 1 to 16.
[63.98 --> 69.28]  As a prisoner of the Lord, then,
[69.64 --> 73.80]  I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.
[74.76 --> 76.86]  Be completely humble and gentle.
[77.56 --> 80.72]  Be patient, bearing with one another in love.
[81.56 --> 84.36]  Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit
[84.36 --> 85.76]  through the bond of peace.
[86.36 --> 89.12]  There is one body and one Spirit,
[89.22 --> 91.56]  just as you were called to one hope when you were called,
[91.56 --> 94.58]  one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
[95.18 --> 96.90]  one God and Father of all,
[97.02 --> 99.42]  who is over all and through all and in all.
[100.40 --> 101.62]  But to each one of us,
[101.72 --> 103.94]  grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.
[104.64 --> 105.74]  This is why it says,
[105.84 --> 107.02]  when he ascended on high,
[107.10 --> 109.46]  he took many captives and gave gifts to his people.
[110.14 --> 111.14]  What does he ascended mean?
[111.20 --> 113.52]  Except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions.
[114.10 --> 115.66]  He who descended is the very one
[115.66 --> 117.90]  who ascended higher than all the heavens
[117.90 --> 119.78]  in order to fill the whole universe.
[120.22 --> 121.60]  Talk about a big picture of Jesus.
[122.56 --> 124.16]  So Christ himself gave the apostles,
[124.40 --> 125.92]  the prophets, the evangelists,
[126.18 --> 127.46]  the pastors and the teachers
[127.46 --> 130.24]  to equip his people for works of service
[130.24 --> 133.46]  so that the whole body of Christ may be built up
[133.46 --> 135.98]  until we all reach unity in the faith
[135.98 --> 138.04]  and in knowledge of the Son of God
[138.04 --> 139.40]  and become mature,
[140.08 --> 141.70]  attaining to the whole measure
[141.70 --> 143.16]  of all the fullness of Christ.
[143.16 --> 146.38]  Then we will no longer be infants
[146.38 --> 148.66]  tossed back and forth by the waves
[148.66 --> 150.04]  and blown here and there
[150.04 --> 151.32]  by every wind of teaching
[151.32 --> 153.78]  and by the cunning and craftiness of people
[153.78 --> 155.22]  in their deceitful scheming.
[156.16 --> 158.72]  Instead, speaking the truth in love,
[159.28 --> 161.38]  we will in all things grow up
[161.38 --> 162.70]  into him who is the head,
[163.10 --> 164.00]  that is Christ.
[164.78 --> 166.24]  From him the whole body,
[166.44 --> 167.60]  joined and held together
[167.60 --> 169.18]  by every supporting ligament,
[169.60 --> 171.24]  grows and builds itself up
[171.24 --> 174.40]  in love as each part does its work.
[179.16 --> 181.72]  Well, in December of 2011,
[181.90 --> 183.48]  Brittany and I became parents
[183.48 --> 186.16]  and we welcomed little Levi into our lives
[186.16 --> 187.10]  who's not so little anymore.
[188.40 --> 189.46]  One of the many surprises,
[189.60 --> 191.20]  and there were many surprises with birth,
[191.84 --> 193.38]  one of the many surprises for me personally
[193.38 --> 195.74]  was that Levi came a full two weeks early
[195.74 --> 197.08]  and we weren't ready for that.
[197.66 --> 199.00]  So we get to the hospital
[199.00 --> 200.22]  and Levi is born
[200.22 --> 202.88]  and in my non-medical opinion,
[203.50 --> 205.78]  he's slightly undercooked, right?
[206.44 --> 207.58]  He has purple hands
[207.58 --> 208.56]  and he has purple feet
[208.56 --> 210.92]  and his eyes were bloodshot
[210.92 --> 212.24]  and I remember looking at the doctor
[212.24 --> 212.76]  and saying like,
[212.84 --> 215.06]  is this gonna stay like this?
[215.66 --> 216.76]  And he just smiled at me,
[216.84 --> 217.76]  he's like, yeah, this will be fine,
[217.82 --> 218.30]  he'll be fine.
[219.28 --> 220.82]  But over the next few days in the hospital
[220.82 --> 221.62]  and the next few weeks
[221.62 --> 222.72]  with the midwife in our home,
[223.06 --> 224.44]  one of the most important things
[224.44 --> 227.22]  they did repeatedly was weigh him.
[227.22 --> 228.80]  You know, he's a pretty small baby,
[229.40 --> 231.18]  pretty tiny and they wanted to know,
[231.30 --> 232.62]  is this little baby who was born early,
[232.70 --> 233.14]  is he growing?
[233.64 --> 234.40]  Is he getting bigger?
[234.54 --> 235.70]  Is he getting healthier?
[235.94 --> 237.18]  That was the most important thing
[237.18 --> 238.72]  for the nurses and the midwives.
[240.12 --> 241.88]  I want you to imagine Paul
[241.88 --> 243.38]  like a nurse or a midwife
[243.38 --> 245.52]  and he's looking at this church in Ephesus
[245.52 --> 246.80]  and he's got that same question.
[246.96 --> 248.40]  Here's this baby church,
[248.96 --> 250.78]  this infant stage church
[250.78 --> 251.92]  and he's asking the question,
[252.52 --> 253.20]  is it growing?
[254.00 --> 254.84]  Is it maturing?
[255.34 --> 256.54]  Is it getting healthier?
[257.22 --> 259.76]  And is it getting bigger as a church?
[261.58 --> 263.08]  You should know that the church in Ephesus,
[263.26 --> 264.02]  just like many churches,
[264.52 --> 265.68]  was a very human church.
[265.80 --> 266.38]  There was divisions.
[266.74 --> 267.86]  They were young in their faith.
[267.94 --> 268.56]  They didn't know yet
[268.56 --> 269.74]  what it meant to follow Jesus.
[269.94 --> 271.04]  There was factions in them,
[271.12 --> 272.66]  division between Jew and Gentile,
[273.08 --> 274.26]  sort of people who thought
[274.26 --> 275.46]  they had more power in the church
[275.46 --> 276.90]  and all sorts of stuff like that.
[277.18 --> 279.00]  And Paul looks at the church and says,
[279.40 --> 281.06]  we've got some growing to do.
[282.00 --> 283.10]  You've got to grow up.
[283.10 --> 284.48]  And interestingly,
[285.14 --> 287.26]  as Paul looks at the immaturity of the church,
[287.34 --> 288.40]  the youngness of the church,
[288.50 --> 289.98]  the mark of maturity,
[290.10 --> 290.66]  this is important,
[291.26 --> 291.78]  is unity.
[292.56 --> 294.52]  The thing that sort of shows him
[294.52 --> 295.66]  that they are growing up
[295.66 --> 296.88]  and maturing in their faith walk
[296.88 --> 298.72]  is that they learn how to love the people
[298.72 --> 299.82]  who are not like them,
[299.88 --> 301.26]  learn how to serve with the people
[301.26 --> 302.34]  who they have disagreements
[302.34 --> 305.34]  and learn how to bear with one another in love.
[306.08 --> 307.34]  That's the mark of maturity,
[308.20 --> 308.54]  unity.
[308.54 --> 311.12]  Let's take a look at this passage.
[311.28 --> 311.96]  Paul starts it,
[311.98 --> 313.58]  you remember this perfectly last week, right?
[313.60 --> 315.08]  He starts it almost the same way
[315.08 --> 316.10]  as he does in Philippians.
[316.18 --> 316.60]  He says,
[317.18 --> 318.08]  as a prisoner of the Lord,
[318.14 --> 319.92]  I then urge you to live a life
[319.92 --> 322.88]  worthy of the calling you have received.
[323.58 --> 324.80]  I love that line.
[325.62 --> 327.08]  The calling you have received.
[327.16 --> 328.80]  Here's what Paul's saying in a nutshell.
[328.94 --> 331.58]  This actually summarizes chapter one and two of Ephesians.
[331.66 --> 332.00]  He's saying,
[332.40 --> 334.88]  you church used to be alienated from Jesus.
[335.12 --> 337.18]  You used to not know his saving work.
[337.18 --> 339.10]  You didn't know what your life was for.
[339.20 --> 340.08]  You were living in darkness,
[340.38 --> 342.56]  but Jesus by his grace reached into your life,
[342.90 --> 343.60]  found your life,
[343.88 --> 345.14]  brought you into salvation
[345.14 --> 346.48]  and his extended grace.
[347.04 --> 348.64]  You now have a new identity
[348.64 --> 350.14]  and a new calling.
[350.96 --> 352.50]  You now belong to Christ
[352.50 --> 356.04]  and you are now to grow into that calling as his people.
[357.14 --> 359.16]  Or to put it as one of my favorite authors puts it,
[359.22 --> 360.42]  the calling of the church now
[360.42 --> 362.52]  is to become what they already are.
[363.14 --> 364.46]  They have to grow into the identity
[364.46 --> 366.08]  Jesus gave them so generously
[366.08 --> 368.44]  and live like they already are
[368.44 --> 369.38]  because of what Jesus did.
[370.20 --> 371.30]  It's almost like raising children.
[371.90 --> 372.72]  They are your children.
[372.82 --> 373.54]  They will stay your children,
[373.62 --> 374.64]  but now they have to start living
[374.64 --> 375.44]  like they're your children.
[375.64 --> 376.78]  They're making you look bad, right?
[377.20 --> 378.12]  That's how it goes.
[379.78 --> 381.46]  Paul starts with some pretty obvious
[381.46 --> 383.42]  and I think important advice
[383.42 --> 384.66]  for a divided church.
[384.66 --> 385.86]  He tells them,
[386.02 --> 386.36]  be humble,
[387.02 --> 387.98]  be gentle,
[388.76 --> 389.60]  be patient,
[390.24 --> 391.46]  bear with one another in love
[391.46 --> 393.40]  and make every effort
[393.40 --> 395.30]  to keep the unity of the spirit
[395.30 --> 396.16]  through the bond of peace.
[396.50 --> 397.72]  Now, you don't have to be a scientist
[397.72 --> 399.52]  to recognize when you read those words
[399.52 --> 400.88]  that between the lines,
[401.32 --> 402.82]  he's speaking into a lot of division.
[403.58 --> 405.14]  Every one of the virtues he mentioned
[405.14 --> 408.20]  are virtues that belong in places of conflict, right?
[409.26 --> 410.00]  Be patient,
[410.16 --> 410.56]  be humble,
[410.68 --> 411.12]  be gentle,
[411.34 --> 412.16]  bear with one another in love,
[412.16 --> 412.96]  make every effort
[412.96 --> 414.06]  to keep the unity of the spirit.
[414.14 --> 415.24]  There is conflict here.
[416.90 --> 417.26]  Interestingly,
[417.56 --> 418.24]  I learned this week
[418.24 --> 418.84]  that patience,
[419.26 --> 420.76]  sort of my understanding
[420.76 --> 421.74]  of patience expanded
[421.74 --> 422.66]  and the Greek patience
[422.66 --> 423.94]  doesn't just mean waiting.
[424.72 --> 424.98]  You know,
[425.06 --> 426.64]  like you're waiting for your spouse
[426.64 --> 427.72]  to get to church on time.
[428.08 --> 428.92]  That's not just patience.
[429.02 --> 429.96]  Patience in the Greek is
[429.96 --> 431.32]  you've been wronged
[431.32 --> 433.40]  and you might have the rightful sense
[433.40 --> 434.86]  to do something in response
[434.86 --> 435.96]  and yet you choose not to.
[436.90 --> 437.62]  It's a sense of
[437.62 --> 440.06]  you choose not to retaliate
[440.06 --> 441.72]  out of a forbearing love
[441.72 --> 442.32]  for that person.
[442.42 --> 443.14]  That's patience.
[444.02 --> 444.60]  Oh man,
[444.68 --> 445.78]  how well the church would do
[445.78 --> 447.56]  to learn patience.
[449.98 --> 451.44]  In verse 7 to 13,
[452.04 --> 452.84]  Paul then addresses
[452.84 --> 454.00]  this thing of leadership
[454.00 --> 456.04]  and I'm not actually going to say
[456.04 --> 456.78]  very much about this
[456.78 --> 457.90]  because Pastor Jonathan
[457.90 --> 458.68]  is going to touch on this
[458.68 --> 459.60]  in just a few weeks
[459.60 --> 460.64]  but I do want to say
[460.64 --> 461.34]  a few words about it.
[461.36 --> 462.02]  He basically says,
[462.24 --> 462.50]  leaders,
[462.78 --> 463.82]  God gives the church leaders
[463.82 --> 465.04]  of different varieties
[465.04 --> 466.46]  and they have different jobs
[466.46 --> 467.58]  to pull out the gifts
[467.58 --> 468.34]  of the church
[468.34 --> 469.58]  so that it grows in knowledge
[469.58 --> 470.16]  and unity
[470.16 --> 470.86]  and faith.
[471.66 --> 472.38]  But interestingly,
[472.58 --> 473.34]  I just want to highlight
[473.34 --> 474.26]  the importance
[474.26 --> 475.40]  of leaders.
[476.16 --> 476.84]  I would suggest
[476.84 --> 477.62]  that as the health
[477.62 --> 478.36]  of leadership goes,
[478.44 --> 479.06]  so goes the health
[479.06 --> 479.62]  of the church.
[480.02 --> 481.38]  Or as a colleague of mine
[481.38 --> 481.88]  once put it,
[481.90 --> 482.82]  I've never forgotten it,
[483.54 --> 484.84]  churches as a body
[484.84 --> 486.74]  rarely ever exceed
[486.74 --> 488.30]  the spiritual maturity
[488.30 --> 489.12]  of their leaders.
[490.14 --> 490.88]  That is to say,
[490.96 --> 492.00]  if leaders are divided,
[492.30 --> 493.02]  churches are divided.
[493.30 --> 494.42]  If leaders are immature,
[494.66 --> 495.66]  churches are often immature.
[495.94 --> 497.00]  If leaders are infighting,
[497.04 --> 498.14]  then churches are often fighting.
[498.24 --> 499.02]  That's how it goes.
[499.82 --> 500.62]  There's a sense in which
[500.62 --> 501.94]  the leaders are the barometer
[501.94 --> 503.38]  of the church.
[503.86 --> 504.96]  And that's not just a word
[504.96 --> 505.44]  for the elders
[505.44 --> 506.08]  and the deacons
[506.08 --> 506.60]  and the pastors
[506.60 --> 507.10]  and the staff.
[507.16 --> 508.06]  It's a word for anyone
[508.06 --> 508.96]  who takes on leadership
[508.96 --> 509.78]  in any form.
[510.50 --> 511.34]  That means youth leaders
[511.34 --> 511.94]  for the church,
[512.56 --> 513.38]  people who lead
[513.38 --> 514.44]  Cornerstone upstairs,
[514.70 --> 515.28]  volunteer leaders
[515.28 --> 516.08]  for story time
[516.08 --> 516.94]  and all the other ministries
[516.94 --> 517.44]  we have here.
[517.64 --> 518.32]  There's a sense in which
[518.32 --> 519.16]  you're a barometer
[519.16 --> 520.38]  of the health
[520.38 --> 521.10]  of that ministry.
[521.68 --> 522.98]  And as the leadership goes,
[523.52 --> 524.34]  so goes the health
[524.34 --> 525.00]  of the church.
[525.00 --> 527.94]  I want to read for you
[527.94 --> 529.16]  a really important transition
[529.16 --> 529.92]  that Paul makes.
[530.04 --> 530.66]  After talking about
[530.66 --> 531.66]  the importance of unity
[531.66 --> 532.56]  and working together
[532.56 --> 533.66]  and the equipping of the gifts,
[534.04 --> 534.72]  he gives a vision
[534.72 --> 535.50]  for what could be
[535.50 --> 535.94]  in the church
[535.94 --> 537.02]  and then he names reality.
[537.10 --> 538.08]  This is what Paul writes.
[538.08 --> 540.72]  Until we all reach unity
[540.72 --> 541.38]  in the faith
[541.38 --> 542.18]  and in the knowledge
[542.18 --> 543.00]  of the Son of God
[543.00 --> 544.72]  and become mature,
[545.28 --> 547.26]  attaining to the whole measure
[547.26 --> 548.84]  of all the fullness of God,
[549.32 --> 551.96]  then we will no longer be infants
[551.96 --> 553.16]  tossed back and forth
[553.16 --> 553.74]  by the waves,
[554.04 --> 554.86]  blown here and there
[554.86 --> 555.78]  by the wind of teaching
[555.78 --> 556.92]  and by the cunning
[556.92 --> 558.20]  and craftiness of people
[558.20 --> 560.10]  in their deceitful scheming.
[561.50 --> 562.34]  Now I mentioned already
[562.34 --> 564.02]  that Paul's key question is,
[564.22 --> 565.40]  is the church growing?
[566.10 --> 567.06]  And Paul then gives a vision.
[567.06 --> 568.10]  He's like, one, you know,
[568.18 --> 569.46]  the church as it grows
[569.46 --> 570.58]  will experience
[570.58 --> 572.40]  the fullness of God.
[573.60 --> 574.06]  Just imagine
[574.76 --> 575.48]  what that looks like
[575.48 --> 575.80]  for a minute.
[576.68 --> 577.72]  Paul's vision for the church
[577.72 --> 579.38]  is that they are so full
[579.38 --> 580.02]  of the Spirit
[580.02 --> 581.12]  that the grace of Christ
[581.12 --> 581.82]  is so transformed
[581.82 --> 582.46]  that they are just
[582.46 --> 583.80]  to the brim
[583.80 --> 584.90]  with the fullness of God.
[585.60 --> 586.34]  And I should just say
[586.34 --> 587.56]  a sort of a statement
[587.56 --> 588.02]  of the future.
[588.12 --> 589.24]  When Christ returns,
[590.36 --> 592.56]  church will be filled
[592.56 --> 594.02]  to the fullness of God.
[594.80 --> 595.56]  I can't wait to see
[595.56 --> 596.30]  what that looks like.
[596.74 --> 597.64]  An end to all hate,
[597.74 --> 598.42]  an end to division,
[598.56 --> 599.34]  an end to infighting,
[599.54 --> 601.16]  and the fullness of God.
[602.26 --> 602.72]  But that's not
[602.72 --> 603.42]  where the church is at.
[603.92 --> 604.68]  The church is at
[604.68 --> 605.58]  a very different stage.
[605.66 --> 606.38]  In fact, Paul gives them
[606.38 --> 606.78]  a word.
[606.92 --> 607.28]  He says,
[607.36 --> 609.48]  you are like infants.
[611.06 --> 612.02]  It's a pretty hard word,
[612.10 --> 612.36]  actually.
[612.74 --> 613.18]  I'm curious,
[613.26 --> 613.90]  what's the first thing
[613.90 --> 614.58]  that comes to mind
[614.58 --> 615.58]  when you think of infants?
[616.02 --> 616.72]  You can say it out loud.
[620.12 --> 620.40]  Demanding.
[622.30 --> 623.10]  Cry babies.
[623.50 --> 623.94]  Keep going.
[623.94 --> 623.98]  Keep going.
[623.98 --> 624.02]  Keep going.
[626.30 --> 627.54]  Selfish.
[628.78 --> 629.50]  Not mine.
[629.84 --> 629.98]  Your.
[631.02 --> 631.82]  I think those are
[631.82 --> 632.44]  really good words,
[632.54 --> 632.86]  actually.
[633.40 --> 634.34]  There's a lot of nods
[634.34 --> 635.00]  in the back row
[635.00 --> 636.00]  of former moms.
[636.60 --> 637.26]  Yeah, there's a sense
[637.26 --> 638.38]  in which babies are needy.
[639.20 --> 639.84]  They're not very
[639.84 --> 640.86]  self-sufficient at all.
[641.28 --> 641.90]  And there's a sense
[641.90 --> 642.50]  in which they're like,
[642.56 --> 642.74]  you know,
[642.82 --> 643.62]  what's mine is mine,
[643.68 --> 644.50]  what's yours is mine.
[644.64 --> 645.40]  If I cry for it,
[645.42 --> 645.92]  I get it.
[646.12 --> 646.76]  And this diaper's
[646.76 --> 647.64]  not going to change itself.
[647.94 --> 648.18]  Right?
[649.02 --> 649.92]  And Paul says,
[650.00 --> 650.48]  hey, church,
[651.34 --> 652.10]  you're infants.
[652.74 --> 653.58]  It's a pretty strong word.
[653.58 --> 655.26]  And he gives a very specific example
[655.26 --> 656.62]  of how they are being infants
[656.62 --> 657.30]  that I want to highlight.
[657.40 --> 657.82]  He says,
[658.14 --> 659.34]  they cannot discern.
[660.08 --> 661.64]  They cannot sort of discern
[661.64 --> 662.80]  what's going on.
[662.86 --> 663.92]  He describes it very strongly.
[664.00 --> 664.18]  He says,
[664.24 --> 665.26]  there's these winds of teaching.
[665.56 --> 666.76]  There's these deceitful schemes.
[666.86 --> 668.00]  There's ideas coming and going.
[668.18 --> 669.16]  And these new believers
[669.16 --> 670.04]  cannot discern
[670.04 --> 671.34]  if they are good or destructive.
[671.70 --> 672.44]  They can lead to life
[672.44 --> 673.26]  or lead to pain.
[673.66 --> 673.90]  Right?
[674.38 --> 675.28]  It's kind of like a baby
[675.28 --> 676.80]  who sees a shiny object over there.
[676.80 --> 677.92]  Then something over there.
[678.36 --> 679.02]  And young believers
[679.02 --> 680.10]  in a similar way
[680.10 --> 681.76]  are easily pulled
[681.76 --> 682.38]  and lured
[682.38 --> 683.76]  into destructive stuff
[683.76 --> 685.18]  because they do not have
[685.18 --> 685.90]  the discernment to say,
[686.02 --> 686.48]  hey, wait a minute.
[687.20 --> 688.42]  As a follower of Jesus,
[689.32 --> 690.36]  how am I to engage
[690.36 --> 690.96]  this teaching,
[691.18 --> 691.78]  this idea,
[691.94 --> 692.98]  this cultural movement?
[693.58 --> 694.40]  What might that be?
[694.44 --> 695.94]  That takes discernment.
[697.56 --> 697.80]  You know,
[697.82 --> 698.42]  I've shared this story
[698.42 --> 699.18]  before years ago,
[699.26 --> 699.96]  but it comes to mind
[699.96 --> 700.76]  every time I think
[700.76 --> 701.50]  of young Christians.
[702.64 --> 703.32]  Years ago,
[703.68 --> 704.30]  when I was working
[704.30 --> 705.26]  with international students
[705.26 --> 705.86]  and discipling
[705.86 --> 706.48]  a number of them,
[706.90 --> 707.70]  I got to know
[707.70 --> 708.30]  this young guy.
[708.40 --> 708.92]  He's Chinese.
[709.20 --> 709.94]  Went to SFU.
[710.38 --> 710.80]  And he and I
[710.80 --> 711.46]  were having coffees
[711.46 --> 712.02]  just talking
[712.02 --> 712.76]  about the Christian faith.
[712.86 --> 713.14]  He grew up
[713.14 --> 714.24]  in a very different home.
[714.28 --> 714.98]  He had a Buddhist mom
[714.98 --> 716.02]  and an atheist dad
[716.02 --> 717.18]  and just questions
[717.18 --> 717.98]  about Christianity.
[718.22 --> 718.88]  Very intrigued,
[719.00 --> 719.58]  attended worship.
[719.70 --> 720.42]  And so I said,
[720.46 --> 721.32]  let's go for another coffee.
[721.40 --> 722.98]  I go to Lougheed Sky Train Station.
[723.10 --> 723.28]  I don't know
[723.28 --> 723.96]  if you've been there before.
[724.42 --> 725.16]  Parked at the curb
[725.16 --> 726.08]  because he's coming out of class
[726.08 --> 727.02]  and we're going to grab a coffee.
[727.58 --> 728.18]  Couldn't find him.
[728.78 --> 729.72]  Looking around for him.
[729.78 --> 730.44]  There's crowds of people.
[730.54 --> 730.92]  And finally,
[731.00 --> 731.98]  I spot him standing
[731.98 --> 733.06]  beside the escalator
[733.06 --> 734.44]  and there's these two guys there
[734.44 --> 735.20]  in this little booth
[735.20 --> 736.12]  and they're handing out
[736.12 --> 737.44]  these Watchtower pamphlets.
[737.58 --> 738.20]  You know what those are from?
[739.34 --> 740.14]  Jehovah's Witnesses.
[740.22 --> 740.60]  That's right.
[741.04 --> 741.78]  And they're handing him
[741.78 --> 742.40]  lots of material.
[742.54 --> 743.38]  They invited him
[743.38 --> 744.18]  to a gathering
[744.18 --> 745.14]  they had going on
[745.14 --> 745.80]  and they gave him
[745.80 --> 746.28]  a bunch of stuff
[746.28 --> 747.44]  and after about 15 minutes
[747.44 --> 748.24]  he finally walks over
[748.24 --> 749.12]  to the car where I am
[749.12 --> 749.72]  and I could just see
[749.72 --> 750.94]  his face is perplexed, right?
[751.30 --> 752.02]  There's a sense in which
[752.02 --> 753.36]  he's been discipled by me.
[753.50 --> 754.20]  He knows a bit about
[754.20 --> 754.64]  what's going on
[754.64 --> 755.02]  in the Christian faith
[755.02 --> 755.60]  and now he's hearing
[755.60 --> 756.44]  some different stuff
[756.44 --> 757.82]  from these Jehovah's Witnesses.
[758.06 --> 760.04]  And I remember saying out loud
[760.04 --> 761.60]  in deep conviction to myself,
[761.70 --> 762.32]  I felt like this was
[762.32 --> 762.98]  a spirit-led moment.
[763.08 --> 763.26]  I said,
[763.66 --> 765.06]  if I don't disciple him,
[765.06 --> 766.50]  somebody will.
[767.82 --> 768.56]  If I don't disciple
[768.56 --> 769.04]  this young guy,
[769.16 --> 770.16]  somebody else will.
[770.34 --> 771.08]  Now here's the thing.
[771.54 --> 772.66]  It's usually not going to be
[772.66 --> 773.56]  a group or a pair
[773.56 --> 774.54]  of Jehovah's Witnesses
[774.54 --> 775.66]  at Lohi Skytrain Station.
[775.80 --> 776.44]  It's going to be
[776.44 --> 777.46]  20 hours on your couch
[777.46 --> 778.12]  watching Netflix.
[779.52 --> 780.18]  Tell me I'm wrong.
[781.44 --> 782.78]  20 hours of watching
[782.78 --> 784.10]  corporate media's interest
[784.10 --> 785.18]  in forming your soul
[785.18 --> 785.84]  and trust me,
[786.14 --> 787.46]  Netflix is discipleship.
[788.38 --> 788.96]  It's going to be
[788.96 --> 790.06]  endless TikTok reels
[790.06 --> 791.00]  and videos and images
[791.00 --> 791.56]  on Instagram
[791.56 --> 792.84]  that are holding out
[792.84 --> 794.70]  for you that shiny new idea
[794.70 --> 796.98]  that new wind of teaching.
[797.54 --> 799.00]  And it's so perfectly curated
[799.00 --> 800.06]  with the right filters
[800.06 --> 801.08]  to pull you into
[801.08 --> 801.88]  quote-unquote
[801.88 --> 803.14]  the new good life.
[804.86 --> 807.04]  And young believers
[807.04 --> 809.36]  do not have the maturity
[809.36 --> 810.42]  to say,
[810.96 --> 812.30]  how does this new wind
[812.30 --> 812.74]  of teaching,
[812.94 --> 814.76]  how does this new shiny idea
[814.76 --> 815.98]  square with being
[815.98 --> 816.78]  a follower of Jesus?
[817.70 --> 818.84]  What does Christ
[818.84 --> 819.98]  by the scriptures
[819.98 --> 821.78]  have to say to me
[821.78 --> 823.58]  about how to engage this
[823.58 --> 824.58]  as his disciple?
[824.82 --> 826.02]  What do mature believers
[826.02 --> 826.64]  in my life
[826.64 --> 827.54]  have to say to me
[827.54 --> 828.48]  about how I engage
[828.48 --> 829.28]  this stuff?
[829.76 --> 830.40]  And I'll just say,
[830.52 --> 830.74]  honestly,
[830.82 --> 831.28]  as a pastor,
[831.40 --> 832.40]  I'm often surprised.
[832.72 --> 833.74]  I'm often surprised
[833.74 --> 834.44]  at how people make up
[834.44 --> 834.76]  their minds
[834.76 --> 836.48]  about very important things,
[836.96 --> 837.22]  right?
[837.24 --> 837.76]  About hell,
[837.98 --> 838.48]  sexuality,
[838.76 --> 839.12]  abortion,
[839.54 --> 840.34]  all sorts of issues
[840.34 --> 840.78]  of the day
[840.78 --> 842.12]  without ever opening
[842.12 --> 842.52]  their Bible.
[843.84 --> 844.30]  There's a sense
[844.30 --> 844.74]  in which they're like,
[844.78 --> 845.80]  hey, I heard this really tweet
[845.80 --> 846.70]  from, oh, I don't know who,
[846.78 --> 847.48]  and that settles it.
[847.54 --> 848.08]  It's like, really?
[848.98 --> 849.62]  You didn't even open
[849.62 --> 849.98]  the Bible.
[850.96 --> 852.02]  And I want to take a moment
[852.02 --> 852.62]  to share with you
[852.62 --> 853.16]  something that's been
[853.16 --> 854.44]  very helpful for me,
[854.56 --> 855.14]  and I learned this
[855.14 --> 855.64]  in university,
[855.86 --> 856.86]  and it's just stuck with me,
[856.90 --> 857.46]  and I come back
[857.46 --> 858.04]  to this regularly.
[858.18 --> 858.64]  It's called,
[858.90 --> 859.84]  if I can get the name straight,
[860.04 --> 862.16]  the Wesleyan Quadrilateral.
[862.72 --> 863.90]  Say that 10 times fast.
[864.82 --> 865.60]  I'm going to get it wrong.
[865.68 --> 866.20]  I did it wrong
[866.20 --> 867.04]  a few times in the morning
[867.04 --> 867.76]  in the 9 a.m. service
[867.76 --> 869.42]  in Deuteron again today.
[869.54 --> 871.10]  So, John Wesley,
[871.20 --> 871.86]  this originally comes
[871.86 --> 872.46]  from John Wesley.
[872.60 --> 873.70]  He's an 18th century
[873.70 --> 874.64]  revivalist preacher,
[875.04 --> 875.62]  Church of England,
[875.86 --> 877.04]  very interesting life.
[877.10 --> 877.74]  You should look him up.
[877.74 --> 878.68]  He was part of
[878.68 --> 879.82]  the abolition movement
[879.82 --> 880.32]  for getting rid
[880.32 --> 881.06]  of the slave trade,
[881.36 --> 882.10]  empowering women
[882.10 --> 882.58]  in ministry,
[882.68 --> 883.84]  all sorts of interesting stuff.
[884.22 --> 885.34]  But he had a really
[885.34 --> 886.62]  important guide
[886.62 --> 888.58]  for discerning ideas,
[888.76 --> 889.54]  discerning teaching,
[889.70 --> 890.32]  discerning new
[890.32 --> 891.02]  cultural movements,
[891.22 --> 892.06]  and this is what it is.
[892.12 --> 892.56]  Oh, I got it.
[892.92 --> 893.32]  Here we go.
[894.16 --> 895.46]  The top is,
[896.24 --> 897.10]  what do the Scriptures
[897.10 --> 899.28]  say about this thing
[899.28 --> 899.80]  that I'm learning,
[899.96 --> 901.30]  this idea that I'm engaging?
[901.40 --> 902.16]  That's like the most
[902.16 --> 902.56]  important thing,
[902.58 --> 903.12]  and not just,
[903.32 --> 904.28]  is there a verse
[904.28 --> 905.62]  that has to say something,
[905.70 --> 906.62]  but what do the Scriptures
[906.62 --> 907.62]  as a whole say
[907.62 --> 908.74]  the movement of creation,
[908.90 --> 909.30]  rebellion,
[909.70 --> 910.72]  Jesus' work on the cross,
[910.80 --> 911.28]  the restoration?
[911.56 --> 912.64]  How do I understand this
[912.64 --> 913.98]  in light of the biblical story?
[914.06 --> 914.52]  Number one.
[914.86 --> 915.48]  Number two,
[916.24 --> 916.64]  tradition.
[917.26 --> 918.32]  And what he means by that is,
[918.84 --> 920.20]  what has the church
[920.20 --> 922.32]  that has gone before me
[922.32 --> 923.52]  with all of its wisdom
[923.52 --> 924.88]  said already?
[925.64 --> 926.68]  That's an important conversation.
[926.84 --> 927.44]  God has given us
[927.44 --> 928.24]  some great gifts
[928.24 --> 929.14]  in the history of the church,
[929.30 --> 930.08]  and we often neglect
[930.08 --> 931.10]  the wisest voices
[931.10 --> 932.06]  from the past.
[932.52 --> 933.92]  And just as an anecdotal thing,
[933.92 --> 935.00]  I'm struck by how
[935.00 --> 935.70]  there's these divisions
[935.70 --> 936.64]  over women in leadership,
[936.80 --> 937.66]  and I just learned this week
[937.66 --> 938.92]  that John Wesley
[938.92 --> 940.58]  in the 1800s
[940.58 --> 941.62]  was talking about this,
[941.94 --> 942.14]  right?
[942.20 --> 942.60]  You'd think it's
[942.60 --> 943.20]  such a new issue.
[944.00 --> 944.42]  Number three,
[944.62 --> 944.94]  reason.
[945.08 --> 946.50]  What can we logically deduce?
[946.60 --> 947.32]  What kind of arguments
[947.32 --> 947.82]  can we make?
[947.88 --> 949.20]  What is philosophically true
[949.20 --> 949.84]  of this idea
[949.84 --> 950.42]  or that teaching?
[950.48 --> 951.44]  And then finally,
[952.44 --> 953.74]  what is the human experience
[953.74 --> 955.58]  of this or this movement,
[955.70 --> 956.06]  this idea,
[956.14 --> 956.54]  this teaching?
[957.06 --> 957.32]  Now,
[957.74 --> 958.38]  how do you think
[958.38 --> 959.34]  most believers default
[959.34 --> 960.26]  whenever we engage
[960.26 --> 960.86]  new things?
[961.68 --> 962.12]  Which one?
[963.74 --> 964.14]  Experience.
[964.34 --> 964.68]  That's right.
[964.78 --> 965.40]  And you know what
[965.40 --> 966.66]  Wesley and many other Christians
[966.66 --> 967.10]  would say?
[967.48 --> 968.30]  That puts you
[968.30 --> 969.58]  at great vulnerability
[969.58 --> 971.52]  because you have not done
[971.52 --> 972.84]  the deep work of discernment.
[973.42 --> 974.76]  You are so vulnerable
[974.76 --> 975.70]  to the winds of teaching
[975.70 --> 976.54]  if all you're doing
[976.54 --> 976.96]  is saying,
[977.46 --> 978.78]  here's my experience.
[979.46 --> 980.30]  And you have neglected
[980.30 --> 981.70]  different arguments,
[981.86 --> 982.34]  you've neglected
[982.34 --> 983.08]  the history of the church,
[983.12 --> 983.72]  and more importantly,
[983.80 --> 984.36]  you've neglected
[984.36 --> 985.30]  what Jesus Christ
[985.30 --> 986.32]  has said in His Word.
[987.22 --> 989.04]  We have discernment to do.
[990.26 --> 991.90]  You know,
[991.94 --> 992.84]  I just want to add one thing.
[992.90 --> 994.02]  I don't like critiquing
[994.02 --> 994.78]  people too often,
[995.28 --> 995.82]  but if I,
[996.06 --> 996.20]  you know,
[996.26 --> 997.22]  John Wesley lived at a time
[997.22 --> 998.54]  where Christians were,
[998.72 --> 999.62]  is the Christendom era,
[1000.00 --> 1001.38]  and I think for us today
[1001.38 --> 1001.98]  in the West,
[1002.26 --> 1003.52]  what we should add to tradition
[1003.52 --> 1004.58]  is listening to Christians
[1004.58 --> 1005.24]  around the world.
[1006.00 --> 1006.66]  I don't think we should
[1006.66 --> 1007.42]  just listen to the Christians
[1007.42 --> 1008.02]  in the past,
[1008.22 --> 1009.60]  especially as the Western church
[1009.60 --> 1010.24]  is smaller
[1010.24 --> 1011.26]  and the global church
[1011.26 --> 1011.72]  in Africa,
[1011.90 --> 1012.16]  Asian,
[1012.26 --> 1013.20]  Latin America is growing.
[1013.58 --> 1014.54]  We have a responsibility
[1014.54 --> 1015.22]  to listen to
[1015.22 --> 1016.08]  what are the believers,
[1016.40 --> 1017.24]  our brothers and sisters,
[1017.62 --> 1018.60]  in very different contexts,
[1018.72 --> 1019.66]  what are they saying
[1019.66 --> 1020.86]  and articulating
[1020.86 --> 1023.00]  and how might we need
[1023.00 --> 1023.74]  to listen.
[1025.18 --> 1026.20]  That's the Wesleyan
[1026.20 --> 1027.72]  quadrilateral.
[1030.16 --> 1030.60]  Now,
[1030.66 --> 1031.28]  here's a point
[1031.28 --> 1032.86]  that Tim Keller makes,
[1032.94 --> 1033.40]  and I'm just going to
[1033.40 --> 1033.98]  share it with you
[1033.98 --> 1034.62]  and let it sit
[1034.62 --> 1035.40]  how it should sit.
[1035.50 --> 1036.90]  Tim Keller's basic point
[1036.90 --> 1037.94]  on Ephesians 4 is,
[1038.94 --> 1040.32]  the church in North America
[1040.32 --> 1042.32]  is far more immature
[1042.32 --> 1044.12]  than we think it is.
[1045.22 --> 1046.00]  Do you agree?
[1046.00 --> 1047.52]  Or,
[1047.64 --> 1048.74]  I could even personalize it,
[1048.78 --> 1049.40]  bring it right to home,
[1049.96 --> 1050.56]  the church,
[1050.86 --> 1052.08]  Hope Community Church
[1052.08 --> 1053.12]  is more immature
[1053.12 --> 1053.90]  than we think it is.
[1053.94 --> 1054.76]  Would you say that's true?
[1055.24 --> 1055.98]  Don't say it out loud.
[1056.10 --> 1056.64]  I don't want to hear it.
[1059.02 --> 1060.24]  I'll add two more points
[1060.24 --> 1061.08]  to Tim Keller's point.
[1061.16 --> 1061.76]  Number one,
[1062.68 --> 1063.90]  it is also true to say
[1063.90 --> 1065.36]  that just by being in church
[1065.36 --> 1066.58]  does not guarantee maturity.
[1067.62 --> 1068.42]  There are people
[1068.42 --> 1069.36]  who have grown up
[1069.36 --> 1069.80]  in the church,
[1069.92 --> 1071.30]  they are well into their years,
[1071.42 --> 1072.44]  and there isn't that sense
[1072.44 --> 1073.00]  of wisdom,
[1073.20 --> 1074.34]  of season love for Christ,
[1074.42 --> 1075.34]  of depth in the knowledge
[1075.34 --> 1075.86]  of the scriptures,
[1076.12 --> 1077.30]  a prayer that leads
[1077.30 --> 1078.04]  to a discerning heart.
[1078.20 --> 1078.96]  It is not guaranteed
[1078.96 --> 1079.80]  that being in the church
[1079.80 --> 1080.52]  leads to maturity.
[1080.80 --> 1081.52]  It often does,
[1081.74 --> 1082.56]  but it's not guaranteed.
[1083.36 --> 1084.56]  And I'll add also to that
[1084.56 --> 1085.18]  what Pastor Sid
[1085.18 --> 1086.18]  will preach on next week,
[1086.24 --> 1086.70]  and that is,
[1087.06 --> 1088.32]  you can have mature convictions,
[1088.76 --> 1089.50]  mature beliefs,
[1089.76 --> 1090.80]  very good doctrine,
[1091.04 --> 1092.54]  and still have a massive gap
[1092.54 --> 1093.62]  between what you believe
[1093.62 --> 1095.58]  and your actual conduct,
[1096.38 --> 1097.42]  your character.
[1098.18 --> 1099.10]  Mature convictions,
[1099.42 --> 1100.50]  immature conduct.
[1101.28 --> 1101.66]  I'll give you
[1101.66 --> 1102.48]  a really good example.
[1103.10 --> 1103.78]  John Stackhouse,
[1103.86 --> 1104.68]  a professor of mine
[1104.68 --> 1105.40]  at Regent College,
[1105.72 --> 1106.40]  tells the story
[1106.40 --> 1107.60]  of going to a debate
[1107.60 --> 1109.14]  between a Christian apologist
[1109.14 --> 1110.42]  and an atheist.
[1110.64 --> 1111.12]  And there's, you know,
[1111.16 --> 1111.52]  they do these
[1111.52 --> 1112.24]  on university campuses
[1112.24 --> 1112.74]  all the time,
[1112.82 --> 1113.72]  like, does God exist?
[1113.84 --> 1115.00]  How can we prove his existence?
[1115.08 --> 1116.12]  Is absolute truth real?
[1116.50 --> 1117.54]  And the Christian apologist
[1117.54 --> 1118.70]  did a phenomenal job
[1118.70 --> 1119.42]  defending the faith,
[1119.56 --> 1120.04]  opening up all
[1120.04 --> 1120.86]  the important questions.
[1121.06 --> 1122.10]  It was a healthy debate.
[1123.30 --> 1123.98]  John Stackhouse
[1123.98 --> 1124.92]  had these two young
[1124.92 --> 1125.76]  university students
[1125.76 --> 1126.30]  behind him,
[1126.32 --> 1127.30]  and one woman said
[1127.30 --> 1127.98]  to the other woman,
[1128.06 --> 1128.86]  as it finishes,
[1129.34 --> 1129.84]  she says,
[1130.14 --> 1131.54]  even if he's right,
[1131.62 --> 1132.02]  talking about
[1132.02 --> 1132.56]  the Christian apologist,
[1132.74 --> 1133.78]  even if he's right,
[1134.38 --> 1135.70]  I don't care.
[1136.14 --> 1138.28]  That guy is so arrogant.
[1139.50 --> 1139.84]  Did you see
[1139.84 --> 1140.34]  what happened there?
[1141.14 --> 1142.22]  What he's saying
[1142.22 --> 1143.02]  was respectable,
[1143.60 --> 1144.32]  worthy of hearing,
[1144.44 --> 1145.52]  but he was so arrogant
[1145.52 --> 1146.42]  in how he communicated,
[1146.54 --> 1147.94]  he did not compel
[1147.94 --> 1148.98]  these two young women
[1148.98 --> 1150.04]  who came out to hear.
[1150.62 --> 1151.32]  How can this guy
[1151.32 --> 1152.34]  talk about God's existence?
[1152.98 --> 1153.72]  Our convictions
[1153.72 --> 1155.26]  are departed from
[1155.26 --> 1156.44]  our conduct.
[1156.44 --> 1160.40]  It's a good question
[1160.40 --> 1161.48]  to ask in your small group
[1161.48 --> 1162.36]  and around the table,
[1163.24 --> 1164.60]  how spiritually mature
[1164.60 --> 1165.70]  do you think you are?
[1167.16 --> 1168.24]  How spiritually mature
[1168.24 --> 1169.28]  is the body
[1169.28 --> 1169.96]  that you're part of
[1169.96 --> 1171.14]  here at Hope Community Church?
[1171.80 --> 1172.92]  And honest conversations
[1172.92 --> 1174.58]  are always the best ones.
[1176.34 --> 1177.28]  Now, let's hear
[1177.28 --> 1178.04]  something encouraging
[1178.04 --> 1179.08]  about Paul's perspective
[1179.08 --> 1179.98]  on the church in Ephesus.
[1180.60 --> 1181.42]  He is not,
[1181.50 --> 1182.40]  I should underscore this,
[1182.46 --> 1183.96]  he is not surprised
[1183.96 --> 1185.20]  by immaturity
[1185.20 --> 1185.72]  in the church.
[1185.72 --> 1187.06]  These are new believers.
[1187.18 --> 1187.86]  These are young believers.
[1187.92 --> 1188.28]  These are people
[1188.28 --> 1188.92]  who are hardened
[1188.92 --> 1190.06]  and shaped and formed
[1190.06 --> 1191.64]  by Roman and Jewish culture.
[1191.82 --> 1192.78]  They're not going to get it
[1192.78 --> 1193.28]  right away.
[1194.00 --> 1194.66]  He's not surprised.
[1195.04 --> 1196.06]  And I would add,
[1196.58 --> 1198.02]  don't we want the church
[1198.02 --> 1199.42]  to have infant Christians?
[1200.58 --> 1201.88]  Don't we want the church
[1201.88 --> 1202.42]  to have people
[1202.42 --> 1202.88]  who are new
[1202.88 --> 1203.80]  to the Christian faith?
[1204.70 --> 1205.28]  Nicky Gumbel,
[1205.36 --> 1206.34]  who leads Alpha Canada
[1206.34 --> 1207.66]  or leads Alpha International,
[1207.84 --> 1208.66]  that sort of introduces
[1208.66 --> 1209.66]  Christian faith to people,
[1209.96 --> 1210.58]  he's often said,
[1210.68 --> 1211.98]  I'm looking for churches
[1211.98 --> 1213.98]  that can really care
[1213.98 --> 1215.30]  for baby Christians.
[1215.72 --> 1217.22]  that can disciple them,
[1217.38 --> 1217.92]  care for them,
[1218.06 --> 1218.44]  love them,
[1218.50 --> 1219.56]  and mature them
[1219.56 --> 1220.76]  into the gospel
[1220.76 --> 1221.58]  of Jesus Christ.
[1222.40 --> 1222.78]  And a church
[1222.78 --> 1224.26]  with no infant believers,
[1224.40 --> 1225.34]  no immature believers,
[1225.44 --> 1226.06]  is often a church
[1226.06 --> 1227.16]  that has a shaky future
[1227.16 --> 1228.76]  because the future
[1228.76 --> 1229.10]  of the church
[1229.10 --> 1230.48]  is always drawing in people
[1230.48 --> 1231.28]  and discipling them
[1231.28 --> 1231.82]  into the way.
[1232.12 --> 1233.00]  What matters for Paul
[1233.00 --> 1233.98]  is not whether or not
[1233.98 --> 1234.74]  they're immature believers.
[1234.82 --> 1235.58]  What matters for him
[1235.58 --> 1236.46]  is that basic question,
[1236.70 --> 1237.34]  are they growing?
[1238.36 --> 1239.62]  Is the church maturing?
[1240.12 --> 1240.70]  Are the people
[1240.70 --> 1241.64]  who are really struggling,
[1241.82 --> 1242.62]  not struggling as much,
[1242.62 --> 1243.12]  is there a sense
[1243.12 --> 1243.54]  in which they are
[1243.54 --> 1244.80]  understanding the love,
[1244.92 --> 1245.26]  the grace,
[1245.36 --> 1246.62]  the power of Jesus
[1246.62 --> 1247.60]  more deeply
[1247.60 --> 1248.48]  as they get older?
[1249.70 --> 1250.64]  That's the question.
[1251.66 --> 1252.90]  And his vision for the church
[1252.90 --> 1254.74]  is that young,
[1255.00 --> 1255.92]  immature believers,
[1256.84 --> 1257.52]  and I don't mean young
[1257.52 --> 1258.32]  just in terms of age,
[1258.40 --> 1259.22]  that immature believers,
[1259.34 --> 1260.06]  whatever their age,
[1260.44 --> 1261.58]  are discipled.
[1262.50 --> 1263.84]  That from their youngest years,
[1263.94 --> 1264.76]  whether it's nursery
[1264.76 --> 1265.64]  or cornerstone
[1265.64 --> 1266.20]  or youth
[1266.20 --> 1266.84]  or young adults
[1266.84 --> 1267.48]  or small group,
[1267.68 --> 1268.64]  that there are people
[1268.64 --> 1270.06]  who come alongside us
[1270.06 --> 1270.48]  and say,
[1270.96 --> 1272.08]  I love you so much,
[1272.46 --> 1273.38]  I'm gonna model
[1273.38 --> 1274.56]  the faith before you,
[1275.34 --> 1276.28]  I'm gonna talk
[1276.28 --> 1278.28]  about the faith with you,
[1278.60 --> 1279.60]  and I'm gonna gently,
[1280.22 --> 1281.60]  lovingly curb
[1281.60 --> 1282.62]  and challenge
[1282.62 --> 1283.72]  the sinful patterns
[1283.72 --> 1284.34]  in your life.
[1285.52 --> 1286.34]  Truth be told,
[1286.84 --> 1287.42]  one of the reasons
[1287.42 --> 1288.24]  we want small groups
[1288.24 --> 1289.32]  to say the centerpiece
[1289.32 --> 1290.02]  of our church life
[1290.02 --> 1290.54]  is we believe
[1290.54 --> 1291.12]  that small groups
[1291.12 --> 1291.90]  are the place
[1291.90 --> 1293.12]  for that to happen.
[1293.68 --> 1294.78]  For mature believers
[1294.78 --> 1295.64]  and immature believers
[1295.64 --> 1296.28]  to be together
[1296.28 --> 1297.56]  and grow in the word,
[1297.56 --> 1298.82]  grow in prayer,
[1299.00 --> 1299.86]  grow in relationship,
[1300.14 --> 1300.90]  and mature.
[1301.72 --> 1303.50]  We want discipleship
[1303.50 --> 1303.92]  to happen,
[1304.02 --> 1304.60]  and honestly,
[1305.28 --> 1306.32]  when Christ returns,
[1306.40 --> 1307.20]  his question for me
[1307.20 --> 1307.92]  and his question for us
[1307.92 --> 1308.26]  as a church
[1308.26 --> 1309.66]  is not how big was hope.
[1310.70 --> 1311.40]  It's probably not even
[1311.40 --> 1312.30]  how much of an impact
[1312.30 --> 1313.10]  did you have on the city.
[1313.36 --> 1314.10]  The question will be,
[1314.22 --> 1315.14]  were you faithful
[1315.14 --> 1317.08]  with the people
[1317.08 --> 1317.78]  in your congregation?
[1318.52 --> 1319.52]  Did you disciple
[1319.52 --> 1320.44]  the people under your care?
[1320.48 --> 1320.94]  I'm not just talking
[1320.94 --> 1321.30]  about pastors,
[1321.42 --> 1321.96]  I'm talking about elders,
[1322.30 --> 1322.62]  deacons,
[1322.80 --> 1323.40]  youth group leaders,
[1323.54 --> 1324.04]  cornerstone leaders,
[1324.14 --> 1324.62]  small group leaders.
[1325.00 --> 1326.14]  Was discipleship
[1326.14 --> 1327.64]  a mark of the church?
[1327.72 --> 1329.18]  Did people grow?
[1330.52 --> 1331.24]  Were you faithful?
[1334.30 --> 1335.20]  In our passage,
[1335.32 --> 1336.26]  Paul gives a pretty clear
[1336.26 --> 1337.22]  picture of maturity,
[1337.36 --> 1337.94]  in my opinion.
[1338.14 --> 1338.36]  In fact,
[1338.44 --> 1339.42]  that first list he gives
[1339.42 --> 1340.06]  of patience,
[1340.54 --> 1340.94]  humility,
[1341.60 --> 1342.10]  gentleness,
[1342.62 --> 1343.40]  bearing with one another
[1343.40 --> 1344.00]  in love,
[1344.62 --> 1344.98]  showing,
[1345.42 --> 1347.04]  leaning into all the unity
[1347.04 --> 1347.60]  of the Spirit,
[1347.82 --> 1349.08]  that's all marks of maturity.
[1349.16 --> 1350.04]  And those are hard things
[1350.04 --> 1350.42]  to do,
[1350.68 --> 1351.52]  but he adds something
[1351.52 --> 1352.20]  in verse 15
[1352.20 --> 1353.44]  that I want to read for you.
[1353.44 --> 1355.06]  Paul adds to the list,
[1355.82 --> 1358.24]  speaking truth in love.
[1359.18 --> 1360.36]  That's a mark of maturity.
[1360.48 --> 1361.54]  Let me read for you
[1361.54 --> 1362.28]  what he says in 15.
[1362.48 --> 1362.88]  Instead,
[1363.58 --> 1364.84]  speaking truth in love,
[1365.20 --> 1366.38]  we will in all things
[1366.38 --> 1367.66]  grow up into him
[1367.66 --> 1368.38]  who is the head,
[1368.50 --> 1369.46]  that is Christ.
[1369.68 --> 1370.56]  First point to make
[1370.56 --> 1371.36]  about that passage
[1371.36 --> 1373.20]  is that you can only grow
[1373.20 --> 1374.06]  in the way of Christ
[1374.06 --> 1375.76]  if there's truth and love.
[1376.44 --> 1377.24]  There's only truth
[1377.24 --> 1378.22]  or there's only love
[1378.22 --> 1378.92]  at the expense of the other.
[1379.02 --> 1379.82]  You're not actually growing
[1379.82 --> 1380.54]  in the way of Christ,
[1380.76 --> 1381.62]  says this passage.
[1381.62 --> 1383.40]  Here's a second point
[1383.40 --> 1383.78]  I want to make
[1383.78 --> 1384.92]  about speaking truth in love.
[1385.88 --> 1387.98]  It is so hard.
[1389.12 --> 1389.88]  Can you relate?
[1391.08 --> 1392.42]  It is so hard
[1392.42 --> 1393.92]  to hold these things together.
[1394.28 --> 1395.10]  We often default
[1395.10 --> 1396.04]  to truth without love
[1396.04 --> 1396.78]  or love without truth,
[1396.84 --> 1397.78]  and in both cases,
[1398.16 --> 1399.22]  people do not experience
[1399.22 --> 1399.84]  the integrity
[1399.84 --> 1400.60]  of what it means
[1400.60 --> 1401.52]  to be the body of Christ.
[1402.40 --> 1402.68]  Now,
[1402.88 --> 1403.48]  I'm going to put up
[1403.48 --> 1403.94]  on the screen
[1403.94 --> 1405.00]  another diagram,
[1405.58 --> 1406.30]  and I just want to say
[1406.30 --> 1406.80]  as an introduction
[1406.80 --> 1407.46]  to this diagram,
[1407.84 --> 1408.80]  I've gotten criticism,
[1409.00 --> 1409.60]  gentle criticism
[1409.60 --> 1410.34]  from people in the church
[1410.34 --> 1411.46]  for not doing enough diagrams.
[1412.04 --> 1412.64]  This Sunday,
[1412.86 --> 1413.14]  two,
[1413.50 --> 1414.02]  one Sunday.
[1414.40 --> 1415.00]  You're welcome,
[1415.12 --> 1415.88]  Hope Community Church.
[1416.32 --> 1417.76]  I don't promise this next week.
[1419.18 --> 1419.38]  Okay,
[1419.54 --> 1420.92]  so Val,
[1421.08 --> 1421.90]  our discipleship coordinator,
[1422.02 --> 1423.04]  and I put this together,
[1423.42 --> 1423.76]  together,
[1424.24 --> 1425.18]  and I want to give Val
[1425.18 --> 1425.52]  the credit
[1425.52 --> 1426.60]  because I had the idea
[1426.60 --> 1427.20]  of doing this
[1427.20 --> 1428.02]  in a quadrant thing,
[1428.08 --> 1429.00]  and Val found the right words.
[1429.04 --> 1429.76]  If you don't like the words,
[1429.84 --> 1430.34]  that's on Val.
[1430.52 --> 1430.76]  Anyway,
[1431.26 --> 1432.30]  we're going to go through this
[1432.30 --> 1433.52]  starting in the top left
[1433.52 --> 1434.78]  and counterclockwise,
[1435.10 --> 1436.22]  if that makes any sense to you.
[1437.02 --> 1439.06]  If you speak high truth
[1439.06 --> 1441.06]  and low love,
[1441.76 --> 1442.80]  it is almost certain
[1442.80 --> 1443.42]  that the person
[1443.42 --> 1444.52]  that you are in conflict with
[1444.52 --> 1445.38]  and in conversation with
[1445.38 --> 1446.38]  is going to feel judged
[1446.38 --> 1447.54]  or condemned.
[1448.12 --> 1449.14]  And you can probably
[1449.14 --> 1450.50]  remember a conversation
[1450.50 --> 1451.94]  where someone came to you
[1451.94 --> 1452.96]  with guns blazing,
[1453.22 --> 1454.28]  there was not a gentleness,
[1454.40 --> 1454.96]  there was not a love,
[1455.04 --> 1456.38]  and you felt condemned.
[1456.90 --> 1458.00]  It was like standing
[1458.00 --> 1458.90]  against a bulldozer.
[1459.18 --> 1459.86]  Have you had that before?
[1460.70 --> 1461.18]  I have.
[1461.38 --> 1462.46]  I've also been the bulldozer.
[1463.52 --> 1464.76]  Going to the bottom corner,
[1465.08 --> 1466.18]  if there is low truth
[1466.18 --> 1466.92]  and low love,
[1467.26 --> 1467.84]  chances are
[1467.84 --> 1468.94]  you don't care
[1468.94 --> 1469.78]  about that person.
[1469.90 --> 1470.50]  You are indifferent,
[1470.68 --> 1471.28]  you're apathetic,
[1471.36 --> 1471.98]  you're not concerned
[1471.98 --> 1472.56]  with their growth,
[1472.78 --> 1473.30]  you're not concerned
[1473.30 --> 1473.92]  with where they're at,
[1474.00 --> 1474.38]  you're not concerned
[1474.38 --> 1475.46]  with sharing your heart
[1475.46 --> 1476.66]  with that fellow believer
[1476.66 --> 1477.44]  or family member.
[1477.82 --> 1478.66]  Indifference and apathy.
[1479.48 --> 1480.22]  Going over to the other
[1480.22 --> 1480.78]  bottom corner,
[1481.08 --> 1482.46]  if you have high love
[1482.46 --> 1483.42]  but low truth,
[1483.68 --> 1484.42]  there's a good chance
[1484.42 --> 1486.22]  you are enabling somebody.
[1487.04 --> 1487.60]  That is to say,
[1487.66 --> 1488.70]  maybe out of fear of conflict,
[1488.80 --> 1488.98]  you're like,
[1489.02 --> 1489.24]  you know what,
[1489.24 --> 1490.36]  I'm just going to encourage them,
[1490.52 --> 1491.40]  I'm just going to listen to them
[1491.40 --> 1492.52]  but I'm not going to say anything.
[1492.86 --> 1494.32]  You're probably going to enable
[1494.32 --> 1495.10]  sinful patterns
[1495.10 --> 1496.96]  that people need to hear about.
[1498.68 --> 1499.42]  And then finally,
[1499.94 --> 1500.56]  high truth,
[1500.98 --> 1501.58]  high love
[1501.58 --> 1502.74]  leads to a person,
[1502.88 --> 1503.30]  I believe,
[1503.54 --> 1504.52]  who has integrity.
[1505.26 --> 1507.12]  Because if you really love someone,
[1507.66 --> 1508.74]  you will speak the truth.
[1509.24 --> 1510.28]  But if you really love someone,
[1510.40 --> 1511.36]  you will speak truth
[1511.36 --> 1512.80]  in a way that they will hear it
[1512.80 --> 1514.18]  because they see your love.
[1514.80 --> 1515.02]  Right?
[1515.54 --> 1516.58]  And I hope we all have
[1516.58 --> 1517.52]  at least one memory
[1517.52 --> 1518.78]  where a parent,
[1518.78 --> 1519.58]  a sibling,
[1520.10 --> 1520.60]  a friend,
[1520.72 --> 1521.18]  an elder,
[1521.50 --> 1522.52]  spoke truth and love
[1522.52 --> 1523.38]  and it pierced you
[1523.38 --> 1524.58]  but it pierced you
[1524.58 --> 1525.88]  with the love of Jesus Christ.
[1526.54 --> 1528.86]  Because nobody speaks truth and love
[1528.86 --> 1529.88]  like Jesus.
[1530.72 --> 1531.04]  In fact,
[1531.12 --> 1532.40]  you can get a master class
[1532.40 --> 1533.60]  on speaking truth and love
[1533.60 --> 1535.76]  just watching Jesus interact
[1535.76 --> 1536.44]  in his ministry.
[1536.88 --> 1537.04]  Right?
[1537.30 --> 1537.98]  Think of that woman
[1537.98 --> 1538.86]  caught in adultery.
[1539.00 --> 1539.34]  She's being,
[1539.66 --> 1539.78]  you know,
[1539.82 --> 1540.78]  people are casting stones,
[1540.84 --> 1541.48]  they're about to cast them
[1541.48 --> 1541.98]  and Jesus says,
[1542.06 --> 1543.24]  I don't condemn you,
[1544.16 --> 1545.06]  go and sin no more.
[1545.74 --> 1546.44]  Truth and love.
[1546.44 --> 1548.36]  Love over and over and over again.
[1548.42 --> 1550.24]  Jesus speaks right into the hearts
[1550.24 --> 1550.56]  of people,
[1550.70 --> 1551.80]  right into their deepest wounds,
[1551.90 --> 1552.46]  their deepest pain.
[1552.62 --> 1554.08]  He exposes and he exposes
[1554.08 --> 1555.00]  with the love
[1555.00 --> 1556.00]  that can come fully
[1556.00 --> 1556.62]  from his heart.
[1557.06 --> 1557.82]  That is God's heart.
[1559.06 --> 1560.04]  But let me ask you the question.
[1560.20 --> 1561.04]  As you look at this
[1561.04 --> 1562.12]  four quadrant,
[1562.24 --> 1562.94]  truth and love,
[1563.46 --> 1564.58]  where do you default?
[1566.40 --> 1567.84]  Think of the last fight you had.
[1568.74 --> 1569.60]  Think of the last quarrel
[1569.60 --> 1570.42]  you had with your sibling
[1570.42 --> 1571.18]  or your roommate
[1571.18 --> 1572.02]  or your friend.
[1572.70 --> 1573.82]  Think of the last conversation
[1573.82 --> 1574.42]  with a coworker
[1574.42 --> 1575.04]  who you are not
[1575.04 --> 1576.12]  ideologically aligned with.
[1576.30 --> 1577.02]  Where did you go?
[1578.46 --> 1579.42]  I know that for me
[1579.42 --> 1580.66]  it's always high truth,
[1580.72 --> 1581.12]  high love.
[1582.62 --> 1583.16]  I'm joking.
[1583.24 --> 1583.78]  I don't do that.
[1585.08 --> 1585.72]  I would like to.
[1587.00 --> 1588.34]  Do you come in with guns blazing
[1588.34 --> 1589.46]  and you just bulldozer them
[1589.46 --> 1590.50]  or do you just back off?
[1590.56 --> 1591.34]  You're a conflict avoider.
[1591.42 --> 1592.26]  We all have those families
[1592.26 --> 1592.94]  where everyone just kind of
[1592.94 --> 1593.58]  backs away
[1593.58 --> 1595.36]  and just throws all the conflict
[1595.36 --> 1596.24]  under the carpet
[1596.24 --> 1597.24]  and kind of walk away
[1597.24 --> 1598.04]  saying let's just leave
[1598.04 --> 1598.60]  that atom bomb
[1598.60 --> 1599.38]  for another day, right?
[1600.26 --> 1601.42]  Which way do you default?
[1601.42 --> 1603.86]  Take time
[1603.86 --> 1604.98]  to think about
[1604.98 --> 1606.08]  what it would look like
[1606.08 --> 1607.16]  to lean into
[1607.16 --> 1608.32]  truth and love.
[1609.36 --> 1610.54]  Let me make two points
[1610.54 --> 1611.06]  about this
[1611.06 --> 1611.92]  and then we'll move on.
[1612.52 --> 1613.16]  Number one,
[1614.74 --> 1616.08]  this is so much harder
[1616.08 --> 1616.76]  than we can do
[1616.76 --> 1618.40]  in our own human capacity.
[1619.44 --> 1621.18]  I find you can even pray
[1621.18 --> 1622.06]  for the capacity
[1622.06 --> 1622.88]  to have truth and love.
[1623.00 --> 1624.32]  You can plan for it
[1624.32 --> 1625.36]  and then conflict happens
[1625.36 --> 1626.26]  and you either start
[1626.26 --> 1627.16]  blasting somebody
[1627.16 --> 1628.22]  or you run away, right?
[1628.74 --> 1629.46]  There's a sense in which
[1629.46 --> 1630.54]  this is way beyond
[1630.54 --> 1631.18]  human capacity
[1631.18 --> 1632.10]  and I want to suggest
[1632.10 --> 1633.08]  if you really are serious
[1633.08 --> 1633.60]  about this
[1633.60 --> 1634.40]  and you're hearing
[1634.40 --> 1635.70]  God calling us
[1635.70 --> 1636.56]  into a better posture
[1636.56 --> 1637.16]  with conflict,
[1637.52 --> 1638.22]  we need to be people
[1638.22 --> 1638.80]  of prayer
[1638.80 --> 1640.72]  and people who have discernment
[1640.72 --> 1641.34]  and people who even
[1641.34 --> 1642.38]  invite others to say
[1642.38 --> 1643.98]  how can we do better
[1643.98 --> 1645.22]  with our words,
[1645.34 --> 1645.92]  our posture,
[1646.12 --> 1646.94]  the way we speak
[1646.94 --> 1647.58]  in conflict?
[1648.74 --> 1649.32]  But second,
[1649.68 --> 1650.24]  and this is just
[1650.24 --> 1651.10]  a personal opinion
[1651.10 --> 1651.98]  but I'd love to hear
[1651.98 --> 1652.36]  your feedback.
[1653.00 --> 1654.06]  I have a feeling
[1654.06 --> 1655.82]  that we can't actually
[1655.82 --> 1656.88]  speak truth and love
[1656.88 --> 1658.06]  without actually being
[1658.06 --> 1659.94]  in person with someone.
[1661.22 --> 1662.00]  That is to say
[1662.00 --> 1663.10]  I'm addressing the reality
[1663.10 --> 1663.82]  of the digital age
[1663.82 --> 1664.34]  in which we live.
[1664.48 --> 1665.60]  Oftentimes our conflict
[1665.60 --> 1666.64]  is not words anymore,
[1666.76 --> 1668.48]  it's text, right?
[1668.64 --> 1669.34]  Or it's an email
[1669.34 --> 1670.40]  where you're pounding away
[1670.40 --> 1671.06]  your little keyboard
[1671.06 --> 1671.76]  trying to say something
[1671.76 --> 1672.16]  that's just going to
[1672.16 --> 1672.54]  tear them down
[1672.54 --> 1673.70]  and you're saying things
[1673.70 --> 1674.86]  that you would never say
[1674.86 --> 1675.76]  to someone in person.
[1676.40 --> 1677.12]  You ever had that before?
[1678.44 --> 1679.12]  I have.
[1679.96 --> 1680.72]  A number of years ago
[1680.72 --> 1682.70]  I was in a theological debate
[1682.70 --> 1683.22]  over email.
[1683.60 --> 1684.98]  Terrible idea by the way,
[1685.08 --> 1685.60]  don't do it.
[1685.60 --> 1686.52]  I can tell you
[1686.52 --> 1687.14]  on the other side
[1687.14 --> 1688.00]  it went poorly
[1688.00 --> 1688.92]  and we're debating
[1688.92 --> 1689.50]  back and forth.
[1689.58 --> 1691.00]  We're like 25 emails in
[1691.00 --> 1691.66]  and we're saying things
[1691.66 --> 1692.54]  we would never say
[1692.54 --> 1693.46]  to each other in person
[1693.46 --> 1695.02]  and finally the other person
[1695.02 --> 1696.16]  said why don't we meet
[1696.16 --> 1696.60]  in person?
[1696.70 --> 1697.74]  I'm like that's a great idea
[1697.74 --> 1698.50]  and we did
[1698.50 --> 1699.46]  and we reconciled
[1699.46 --> 1701.62]  and I was so off
[1701.62 --> 1703.10]  in what I assumed of them
[1703.10 --> 1704.60]  and they were so off
[1704.60 --> 1705.54]  in what they assumed of me
[1705.54 --> 1707.96]  and we found so much understanding
[1707.96 --> 1708.82]  and we were able to say
[1708.82 --> 1710.32]  we can disagree on this.
[1711.42 --> 1712.60]  Let's stop hating each other
[1712.60 --> 1713.02]  by email.
[1713.02 --> 1716.12]  Can you relate to that?
[1716.70 --> 1717.48]  I just want to suggest
[1717.48 --> 1718.78]  if you're in conflict right now
[1718.78 --> 1720.24]  I bet you some of the conflict
[1720.24 --> 1721.94]  is because it's done digitally
[1721.94 --> 1723.10]  first of all
[1723.10 --> 1724.12]  but I want to suggest
[1724.12 --> 1725.04]  if you're doing texts
[1725.04 --> 1725.76]  or emails
[1725.76 --> 1726.86]  see if you can do
[1726.86 --> 1728.04]  a phone call instead
[1728.04 --> 1729.88]  or even better
[1729.88 --> 1730.76]  if you're doing phone calls
[1730.76 --> 1731.50]  see if you can meet
[1731.50 --> 1732.62]  in person instead
[1732.62 --> 1735.10]  and actually speak truth
[1735.10 --> 1736.04]  in love.
[1736.42 --> 1737.32]  When you're face to face
[1737.32 --> 1737.62]  with somebody
[1737.62 --> 1738.44]  they see your eyes
[1738.44 --> 1739.12]  they see your mouth
[1739.12 --> 1739.88]  they see your posture
[1739.88 --> 1740.66]  they see your vulnerability
[1740.66 --> 1742.22]  and you can be accountable
[1742.22 --> 1743.96]  to what you are saying
[1743.96 --> 1745.22]  and lead the way
[1745.22 --> 1745.96]  in terms of actually
[1745.96 --> 1746.72]  speaking truth
[1746.72 --> 1748.24]  in a posture of love.
[1750.86 --> 1752.24]  Okay, I was saying more about that
[1752.24 --> 1752.76]  than I was originally
[1752.76 --> 1753.48]  planning on saying.
[1755.52 --> 1756.24]  Let me finish
[1756.24 --> 1756.92]  with the bookends
[1756.92 --> 1757.52]  of encouragement
[1757.52 --> 1758.22]  that Paul gives
[1758.22 --> 1758.82]  in this passage.
[1758.94 --> 1760.12]  He starts by saying
[1760.12 --> 1761.52]  live a life worthy
[1761.52 --> 1762.02]  of the calling
[1762.02 --> 1763.16]  you've already received.
[1763.58 --> 1764.16]  That is to say
[1764.16 --> 1764.54]  church
[1764.54 --> 1765.68]  the work of Christ
[1765.68 --> 1766.62]  has already been finished
[1766.62 --> 1767.98]  the forgiveness of Christ
[1767.98 --> 1768.94]  has already been extended
[1768.94 --> 1770.18]  the identity of the church
[1770.18 --> 1770.62]  in Ephesus
[1770.62 --> 1771.42]  and the church here
[1771.42 --> 1771.94]  at Hope Community
[1771.94 --> 1773.70]  is already established
[1773.70 --> 1775.06]  by what has been done
[1775.06 --> 1775.44]  in Jesus.
[1775.64 --> 1776.20]  Praise the Lord.
[1776.84 --> 1777.88]  By leaning into these things
[1777.88 --> 1778.80]  we don't earn the favor
[1778.80 --> 1779.24]  of Christ
[1779.24 --> 1780.44]  we don't earn more love
[1780.44 --> 1780.86]  of the Father
[1780.86 --> 1782.16]  that's already been secured.
[1782.68 --> 1783.46]  Now it's growing
[1783.46 --> 1784.78]  into what we already have
[1784.78 --> 1786.04]  as brothers and sisters
[1786.04 --> 1786.80]  in Christ.
[1787.32 --> 1788.16]  And Paul finishes
[1788.16 --> 1789.60]  with this beautiful hope
[1789.60 --> 1790.86]  where he says
[1790.86 --> 1792.00]  don't forget
[1792.00 --> 1794.20]  that as the church
[1794.20 --> 1795.38]  as broken
[1795.38 --> 1796.72]  ordinary individuals
[1796.72 --> 1797.80]  and now gathered
[1797.80 --> 1798.44]  as a community
[1798.44 --> 1800.60]  Jesus is the head
[1800.60 --> 1802.18]  that connects
[1802.18 --> 1802.92]  and animates
[1802.92 --> 1803.80]  all the life
[1803.80 --> 1804.42]  of the body.
[1804.54 --> 1805.18]  Let me read for you
[1805.18 --> 1805.70]  how we finish.
[1805.82 --> 1806.16]  He says
[1806.16 --> 1806.68]  from him
[1806.68 --> 1807.32]  that is Jesus
[1807.32 --> 1808.60]  the whole body
[1808.60 --> 1809.80]  is joined together
[1809.80 --> 1811.12]  held together
[1811.12 --> 1812.54]  by every supporting ligament
[1812.54 --> 1813.24]  and it grows
[1813.24 --> 1814.30]  and builds itself up
[1814.30 --> 1815.06]  in love
[1815.06 --> 1816.26]  as each part
[1816.26 --> 1817.10]  does its work.
[1818.34 --> 1819.06]  And Paul wants
[1819.06 --> 1819.88]  everyone who reads
[1819.88 --> 1820.32]  this passage
[1820.32 --> 1820.86]  to know
[1820.86 --> 1822.66]  Jesus is the head
[1822.66 --> 1824.96]  and because he's the head
[1824.96 --> 1825.84]  you're all connected
[1825.84 --> 1826.26]  to him
[1826.26 --> 1826.88]  and his life
[1826.88 --> 1828.32]  flows through
[1828.32 --> 1828.90]  the body
[1828.90 --> 1829.74]  to you
[1829.74 --> 1831.82]  whatever little part
[1831.82 --> 1832.92]  you have to play.
[1833.92 --> 1834.50]  And for me
[1834.50 --> 1834.92]  that gives me
[1834.92 --> 1835.86]  a great deal of hope
[1835.86 --> 1836.82]  because insofar
[1836.82 --> 1837.44]  as we connected
[1837.44 --> 1837.98]  to Jesus
[1837.98 --> 1839.80]  change can happen.
[1840.80 --> 1841.92]  Love can happen.
[1842.78 --> 1843.80]  Truth can be spoken
[1843.80 --> 1844.58]  without cuts.
[1845.28 --> 1845.76]  Humility
[1845.76 --> 1846.64]  and gentleness
[1846.64 --> 1847.36]  and patience
[1847.36 --> 1848.18]  and unity
[1848.18 --> 1849.38]  can happen
[1849.38 --> 1850.66]  insofar
[1850.66 --> 1851.38]  as we together
[1851.38 --> 1852.20]  stay connected
[1852.20 --> 1853.40]  to Jesus Christ
[1853.40 --> 1854.38]  the head.
[1854.38 --> 1855.98]  let's pray.
[1861.40 --> 1862.32]  Father we thank you
[1862.32 --> 1862.94]  for your word
[1862.94 --> 1864.88]  and we pray
[1864.88 --> 1865.50]  that you give us
[1865.50 --> 1866.40]  ears to hear
[1866.40 --> 1867.50]  what we need to hear
[1867.50 --> 1869.88]  whatever the situation
[1869.88 --> 1870.72]  whatever the conflict
[1870.72 --> 1871.60]  we have in our lives
[1871.60 --> 1872.68]  we ask for your spirit
[1872.68 --> 1873.92]  to minister to us
[1873.92 --> 1875.76]  to equip us
[1875.76 --> 1877.18]  with all the virtues
[1877.18 --> 1878.22]  that you list
[1878.22 --> 1879.02]  in this passage.
[1880.00 --> 1880.96]  Make us one.
[1882.00 --> 1882.98]  Give us gentleness.
[1882.98 --> 1884.84]  Give us humility.
[1885.40 --> 1886.24]  Give us patience
[1886.24 --> 1886.70]  and Lord
[1886.70 --> 1887.62]  teach us
[1887.62 --> 1888.44]  by your spirit
[1888.44 --> 1889.74]  to speak truth
[1889.74 --> 1890.48]  in love.
[1891.34 --> 1892.72]  We pray for the life
[1892.72 --> 1893.08]  of Jesus
[1893.08 --> 1894.84]  to flow through this body
[1894.84 --> 1896.56]  and that we together
[1896.56 --> 1897.04]  would show
[1897.04 --> 1898.60]  the reconciling power
[1898.60 --> 1899.44]  of the gospel.
[1900.22 --> 1901.00]  We ask this
[1901.00 --> 1902.20]  in Jesus mighty name.
[1902.82 --> 1903.04]  Amen.
[1904.62 --> 1905.82]  I invite you to stand
[1905.82 --> 1906.54]  and sing with me
[1906.54 --> 1907.16]  what is sort of
[1907.16 --> 1907.90]  our theme song
[1907.90 --> 1908.54]  for this series
[1908.54 --> 1909.76]  that is Rain in Us.
[1909.76 --> 1911.72]  ram США
[1911.72 --> 1912.08]  now
[1916.08 --> 1916.60]  to brew
[1916.60 --> 1917.34]  that consent
[1917.34 --> 1918.18]  is what
[1918.46 --> 1933.84]  C
[1934.02 --> 1935.54]  and
[1935.54 --> 1936.02]  you
