[0.00 --> 5.48]  Well, happy Thanksgiving, Hope.
[6.08 --> 8.84]  It is such a good practice to gather as the church
[8.84 --> 11.44]  and practice gratitude as a community
[11.44 --> 13.02]  because we're the people who know
[13.02 --> 14.56]  where all the good gifts come from.
[17.96 --> 21.10]  This summer, my brother got Brittany and I
[21.10 --> 22.88]  into the TV series alone.
[23.44 --> 25.30]  Who here knows the TV series alone?
[25.84 --> 27.54]  Okay, very few of us.
[28.04 --> 29.40]  Now the rest of you know what you're going to do
[29.40 --> 30.04]  tomorrow.
[31.14 --> 33.76]  So the TV series alone is a reality show
[33.76 --> 35.28]  that's based on the premise of 10 people
[35.28 --> 36.58]  who go out into the wilderness.
[36.80 --> 38.20]  Actually, two of the seasons are filmed
[38.20 --> 40.38]  on Vancouver Island and they go by themselves.
[40.56 --> 42.92]  They film themselves and whoever can survive
[42.92 --> 45.08]  off the land, fishing, build their own shelters
[45.08 --> 47.14]  and the elements, they win $500,000.
[47.72 --> 48.82]  There's a few people in our church
[48.82 --> 50.36]  who I think could win this sucker, but anyway.
[51.32 --> 53.26]  My brother got me hooked on the show by saying,
[53.34 --> 54.74]  Dave, you're going to watch it because the people
[54.74 --> 57.22]  who last the longest go through deep transformation
[57.22 --> 59.90]  and they often get really spiritual.
[60.32 --> 61.28]  So of course I was hooked.
[61.42 --> 62.84]  So here I am talking about it on Sunday morning.
[63.74 --> 66.00]  One of the things you notice about people
[66.00 --> 68.20]  who last long in this show alone,
[68.28 --> 71.02]  where they go weeks, months on end in alone,
[71.42 --> 73.00]  is they learn gratitude.
[74.06 --> 75.96]  Their life gets stripped right down.
[76.06 --> 78.22]  They don't get Wi-Fi, they don't have family with them,
[78.26 --> 79.30]  they don't get the food they like,
[79.34 --> 80.44]  no coffee in the morning,
[80.64 --> 82.22]  and they have to learn how to survive.
[82.22 --> 84.96]  And all of a sudden the basic things of life
[84.96 --> 86.78]  become a big deal.
[87.72 --> 89.84]  There's one guy who after 10 days of rain,
[89.94 --> 90.90]  because he was in the States,
[90.98 --> 92.22]  never been on Vancouver Island rain,
[92.48 --> 93.42]  just pouring rain.
[93.54 --> 96.46]  On the 10th day, the sun breaks out over the mountains
[96.46 --> 98.00]  and he along with others on the show,
[98.10 --> 99.20]  they just walk to the ocean
[99.20 --> 102.88]  and his arms are stretched out in gratitude for sunshine.
[104.20 --> 106.06]  Another fellow went three days without food
[106.06 --> 107.22]  because he didn't know how to fish well
[107.22 --> 108.28]  and he couldn't forage well
[108.28 --> 111.20]  and he caught this tiny little rock bass fish
[111.20 --> 112.78]  and he's holding this fish
[112.78 --> 114.52]  and the tears are streaming down his face
[114.52 --> 116.78]  and he prays a prayer of gratitude to God
[116.78 --> 118.40]  for food that day.
[119.60 --> 121.28]  And when they talk on the show,
[121.34 --> 122.86]  they do a lot of talking just to themselves,
[122.98 --> 123.50]  to the camera,
[124.06 --> 125.70]  so many of them talk about
[125.70 --> 128.96]  how ungrateful they were in their modern life.
[129.76 --> 131.50]  If only I could go back and tell my wife
[131.50 --> 133.30]  how good it was, the home we had.
[133.76 --> 134.80]  If only I knew what it was like
[134.80 --> 137.10]  to have stock cupboards and clean water
[137.10 --> 139.00]  and time to play outside with my kids,
[139.08 --> 140.42]  the job I have is such a gift.
[140.42 --> 142.32]  On and on and on they go
[142.32 --> 143.74]  about their ingratitude
[143.74 --> 145.78]  for their life in the modern world.
[145.86 --> 146.68]  Can you relate to that?
[148.12 --> 149.12]  I mean, just think for a moment.
[149.20 --> 150.26]  Here we are in British Columbia,
[150.64 --> 152.48]  which our welcome signs from Alberta say
[152.48 --> 152.96]  is, quote,
[153.02 --> 154.40]  the best place on earth.
[154.82 --> 156.36]  We've got an ego problem, by the way.
[156.80 --> 158.10]  Alberta doesn't agree with us,
[158.34 --> 160.18]  although they vacation here all summer long, so.
[161.52 --> 163.14]  We live in the best place on earth.
[163.46 --> 165.30]  We have some of the best drinking water
[165.30 --> 167.42]  in the world running through our faucets.
[167.42 --> 169.04]  Have you ever noticed that?
[169.62 --> 171.82]  We get to enjoy medical care.
[172.14 --> 172.94]  You break your arm,
[173.04 --> 173.72]  you go to the hospital,
[173.80 --> 174.54]  they'll take care of you.
[175.24 --> 176.80]  You and I can buy a latte
[176.80 --> 178.72]  by swiping our Apple watch.
[179.84 --> 180.74]  It's good life.
[181.48 --> 182.44]  And yet, so often,
[182.54 --> 183.98]  the way that we live our lives
[183.98 --> 185.50]  is hurried, anxious, and unhappy.
[185.84 --> 187.68]  Or I might add, entitled.
[188.64 --> 189.56]  Is that your reality?
[190.56 --> 191.74]  And it's for these reasons
[191.74 --> 192.88]  that a Sunday like this
[192.88 --> 194.22]  is so important for the church
[194.22 --> 195.08]  to stop,
[195.28 --> 198.16]  to take stock of the abundant goodness of God,
[198.32 --> 200.18]  and to give thanks.
[200.46 --> 201.50]  That's what we're doing this morning.
[202.42 --> 202.98]  And I don't know if you know
[202.98 --> 204.48]  the history of Thanksgiving in Canada.
[205.24 --> 206.52]  The most important part to know
[206.52 --> 207.68]  is that it's on the right day,
[207.90 --> 209.08]  contra our American neighbors
[209.08 --> 211.18]  who eat Thanksgiving right before Christmas.
[211.30 --> 212.24]  What's wrong with that, Grace?
[213.04 --> 213.88]  And a few others.
[214.88 --> 216.54]  But early in Canada's history,
[216.78 --> 218.96]  as sort of the provinces were aligning,
[219.52 --> 222.44]  the government of Canada in 1859 said,
[222.60 --> 223.66]  we invite Canadians,
[223.72 --> 224.38]  and I'll read the quote,
[224.44 --> 225.60]  we invite all Canadians
[225.60 --> 228.14]  to declare a Thanksgiving day
[228.14 --> 229.72]  where everyone takes a holiday
[229.72 --> 233.04]  in public and solemn recognition
[233.04 --> 234.42]  of God's mercies,
[234.98 --> 236.34]  thanking God Almighty
[236.34 --> 237.72]  for the bountiful harvest
[237.72 --> 239.66]  with which Canada has been blessed.
[240.48 --> 241.62]  That's how Thanksgiving started
[241.62 --> 242.38]  for our country
[242.38 --> 243.26]  and many other countries.
[243.26 --> 244.12]  And of course,
[244.20 --> 245.46]  it's timed with the end of the harvest.
[245.58 --> 246.32]  In the 9 a.m. service,
[246.40 --> 247.52]  we had a bunch of farmers in our church
[247.52 --> 249.58]  who just finished their harvest this morning,
[249.80 --> 251.66]  and they were tired and thankful
[251.66 --> 253.24]  for another season
[253.24 --> 254.70]  of God providing us with food.
[254.78 --> 255.32]  And this bread here
[255.32 --> 256.66]  is a symbol of God's provision.
[257.54 --> 258.18]  And in a year
[258.18 --> 260.54]  where we had unprecedented flooding
[260.54 --> 263.42]  followed by unprecedented drought,
[264.14 --> 266.46]  we stop and we give thanks
[266.46 --> 268.48]  to God for His provision.
[270.02 --> 271.34]  Now, the passage we're going to read
[271.34 --> 272.34]  this morning is actually one
[272.34 --> 273.74]  we've already touched on in James.
[274.14 --> 274.88]  When I preached on this
[274.88 --> 275.42]  a few weeks ago,
[275.46 --> 276.78]  I thought there's more in that passage
[276.78 --> 277.60]  for us to talk about,
[277.70 --> 278.72]  and so I'm coming back to it
[278.72 --> 279.32]  for Thanksgiving.
[279.98 --> 281.82]  And it's James 1, 16 to 18,
[281.96 --> 283.08]  and it will be on the screen.
[283.94 --> 285.16]  James says to the believers
[285.16 --> 286.02]  in the first century,
[286.22 --> 287.82]  do not be deceived,
[288.02 --> 288.86]  brothers and sisters.
[289.50 --> 291.02]  Every good and perfect gift
[291.02 --> 292.00]  is from above,
[292.48 --> 293.72]  coming down from the Father
[293.72 --> 294.86]  of the heavenly lights,
[295.12 --> 296.40]  who does not change
[296.40 --> 297.44]  like shifting shadows.
[297.44 --> 300.96]  Isn't it interesting
[300.96 --> 302.50]  how James starts with the line,
[303.16 --> 303.94]  don't be deceived?
[304.84 --> 305.78]  You know what that means?
[306.32 --> 307.24]  That means there's believers
[307.24 --> 308.28]  that he's writing to,
[308.62 --> 309.68]  Christians following Jesus,
[310.00 --> 311.56]  who do not yet understand
[311.56 --> 312.56]  the character of the Father.
[313.06 --> 314.32]  They're deceived in some way
[314.32 --> 315.00]  about who He is,
[315.04 --> 315.42]  His goodness,
[315.56 --> 316.04]  His provision,
[316.28 --> 317.18]  the way He takes care
[317.18 --> 317.70]  of His people.
[318.20 --> 319.64]  And so James dispels
[319.64 --> 321.20]  the incorrect way
[321.20 --> 321.84]  they're viewing
[321.84 --> 323.02]  the character of God.
[323.12 --> 323.38]  He says,
[323.48 --> 324.62]  don't be deceived.
[324.98 --> 326.14]  And if you know the context,
[326.36 --> 327.12]  you'll know why
[327.12 --> 327.68]  they were deceived.
[327.78 --> 328.56]  And if you heard two weeks ago,
[328.60 --> 329.80]  you know the answer to this, right?
[330.32 --> 330.76]  You all remember
[330.76 --> 331.32]  the sermon perfectly?
[331.94 --> 333.36]  The context is there's challenges,
[333.68 --> 334.24]  there's trials,
[334.34 --> 335.12]  and there's temptations.
[335.30 --> 335.88]  The believers are going
[335.88 --> 337.28]  through a hard time.
[338.00 --> 339.10]  What happens when people
[339.10 --> 340.48]  go through hard times is what?
[341.38 --> 342.54]  They start getting grumpy.
[343.34 --> 344.18]  They start complaining.
[344.90 --> 345.78]  And just like we would do,
[345.84 --> 346.96]  we start pointing the finger
[346.96 --> 347.92]  at God and saying,
[348.08 --> 349.62]  are you doing this to me?
[350.22 --> 351.34]  Are you the source
[351.34 --> 352.14]  of the challenges
[352.14 --> 352.88]  and the difficulty
[352.88 --> 353.52]  and the temptation
[353.52 --> 354.02]  in my life?
[354.02 --> 355.40]  Why are you, God,
[355.52 --> 356.38]  bringing these things
[356.38 --> 357.22]  into my life?
[358.58 --> 359.68]  And it's true, I think,
[359.70 --> 360.98]  that when the going gets tough,
[361.30 --> 362.80]  we start blaming God.
[363.72 --> 364.74]  I would add to that,
[365.14 --> 366.18]  when the going gets tough,
[366.24 --> 367.54]  we start overlooking
[367.54 --> 368.92]  the goodness that God
[368.92 --> 369.86]  still shows in our life
[369.86 --> 371.26]  in spite of the difficulty.
[372.42 --> 372.78]  And I would add,
[372.90 --> 374.24]  even more than that,
[374.82 --> 375.42]  for those of us
[375.42 --> 376.62]  living a pretty good life,
[376.84 --> 378.00]  when life is going well,
[378.12 --> 378.96]  even then,
[379.16 --> 380.62]  we overlook the goodness of God.
[380.66 --> 381.14]  Would you agree?
[381.14 --> 383.60]  As one person put it to me
[383.60 --> 384.50]  not that long ago,
[384.60 --> 385.64]  when the going gets tough,
[385.72 --> 386.52]  we blame God,
[387.12 --> 388.28]  and when the going goes well,
[388.60 --> 389.62]  we forget God.
[391.68 --> 392.92]  Or I could even reframe it.
[392.94 --> 393.86]  When the going gets tough,
[393.92 --> 394.52]  we blame God,
[394.58 --> 395.58]  and when the going goes well,
[396.18 --> 397.12]  we take the credit
[397.12 --> 399.54]  because we've forgotten God.
[400.58 --> 401.68]  And the practice
[401.68 --> 403.24]  that opens us up
[403.24 --> 404.22]  to the goodness of God
[404.22 --> 405.60]  is gratitude.
[405.60 --> 407.70]  And James makes
[407.70 --> 409.22]  unequivocally clear
[409.22 --> 410.52]  that the source
[410.52 --> 412.22]  of every good gift
[412.22 --> 413.32]  that you and I
[413.32 --> 413.88]  get to do,
[414.06 --> 414.52]  experience,
[414.62 --> 415.34]  and live in
[415.34 --> 416.56]  is from the Father,
[416.94 --> 418.34]  who does not change
[418.34 --> 419.30]  like shifting shadows.
[419.50 --> 420.30]  He's reliable,
[420.92 --> 421.82]  he's consistent,
[422.26 --> 423.44]  and he is good.
[424.42 --> 425.48]  And what James wants to know
[425.48 --> 425.94]  is it's not like
[425.94 --> 426.74]  the Father's character
[426.74 --> 427.36]  is I'll give you
[427.36 --> 428.12]  something good one day
[428.12 --> 428.78]  and I'm going to snatch
[428.78 --> 429.64]  that back the next,
[430.36 --> 431.62]  that he's sort of vindictive
[431.62 --> 432.68]  or he's sort of watching you,
[432.78 --> 432.92]  you know,
[432.98 --> 434.16]  the way that we describe Santa,
[434.28 --> 435.10]  where he's checking to see
[435.10 --> 435.92]  if you're worthy of something
[435.92 --> 436.72]  and he won't give it to you
[436.72 --> 437.62]  if you're not good that year.
[438.00 --> 438.98]  God is reliable,
[439.76 --> 440.50]  he's consistent,
[440.96 --> 441.86]  and he's good.
[442.70 --> 443.34]  And James wants
[443.34 --> 444.10]  every believer
[444.10 --> 445.10]  struggling with
[445.10 --> 446.14]  whatever they're struggling with,
[446.18 --> 446.60]  in their case,
[446.68 --> 447.58]  increasing persecution
[447.58 --> 448.50]  and temptations,
[448.68 --> 449.86]  to see that the source
[449.86 --> 451.24]  of their good things in life,
[452.08 --> 453.12]  the abundant provision,
[454.00 --> 455.06]  is from their Heavenly Father.
[455.20 --> 456.02]  No other source.
[456.10 --> 457.04]  It doesn't come from them.
[457.46 --> 458.06]  It doesn't come from
[458.06 --> 458.70]  some other God.
[458.78 --> 460.20]  It comes from the Father.
[462.68 --> 463.58]  Now, you need to know
[463.58 --> 464.06]  that James,
[464.06 --> 464.94]  as we've said
[464.94 --> 465.60]  throughout this series,
[465.74 --> 466.68]  he relies heavily
[466.68 --> 468.24]  on Old Testament wisdom literature
[468.24 --> 469.80]  to bring his teaching
[469.80 --> 470.40]  to the church.
[470.50 --> 471.94]  He fuses Old Testament wisdom literature
[471.94 --> 472.80]  with the teaching of Jesus
[472.80 --> 474.20]  and brings it to believers.
[474.66 --> 475.94]  And he's probably steeped,
[475.94 --> 477.08]  as many writers suggest,
[477.24 --> 478.38]  in the Psalms
[478.38 --> 479.14]  and the Proverbs
[479.14 --> 479.94]  and Ecclesiastes.
[480.08 --> 480.48]  And I want to read
[480.48 --> 481.60]  just a couple passages
[481.60 --> 482.70]  that are probably
[482.70 --> 484.04]  in the back of James' mind
[484.04 --> 485.06]  as he teaches
[485.06 --> 486.32]  on the good character of God.
[486.42 --> 486.68]  One,
[487.36 --> 489.08]  this comes from Psalm 34.8.
[489.48 --> 490.14]  This one was read
[490.14 --> 490.96]  at all the weddings
[490.96 --> 492.26]  in the Groen family.
[493.34 --> 494.62]  Taste and see
[494.62 --> 497.48]  that the Lord is good.
[498.62 --> 499.10]  You know what I like
[499.10 --> 499.64]  about that one?
[500.36 --> 501.24]  The goodness of God
[501.24 --> 502.18]  is something tangible.
[502.86 --> 504.20]  As you enjoy good drinks,
[504.28 --> 505.12]  as you eat good food,
[505.20 --> 506.50]  as you see beautiful things,
[506.50 --> 507.64]  you can taste and see
[507.64 --> 509.70]  that the Lord is good.
[510.50 --> 511.78]  Or Ecclesiastes 2,
[511.90 --> 512.80]  more wisdom literature.
[513.30 --> 514.80]  A person can do nothing better
[514.80 --> 515.80]  than to eat and drink
[515.80 --> 516.94]  and find satisfaction
[516.94 --> 517.82]  in their own toil.
[517.82 --> 519.74]  This too, I see,
[520.18 --> 521.76]  is from the hand of God.
[522.30 --> 523.06]  For without Him,
[523.08 --> 523.80]  I love this question,
[523.92 --> 524.98]  for without Him,
[525.50 --> 527.62]  who can find enjoyment?
[529.04 --> 529.66]  Isn't that interesting?
[529.86 --> 530.32]  For without Him,
[530.36 --> 530.96]  who can eat
[530.96 --> 532.20]  or find enjoyment?
[532.30 --> 532.92]  That understanding
[532.92 --> 534.16]  that the source of good food,
[534.24 --> 534.98]  the source of provision,
[535.32 --> 537.08]  is always God.
[537.62 --> 538.16]  It's not you.
[538.84 --> 539.42]  It's not me.
[539.94 --> 540.92]  It's not how clever we are.
[541.26 --> 541.98]  It's a good,
[542.18 --> 542.50]  generous,
[542.66 --> 543.52]  reliable Father.
[543.52 --> 546.18]  And the practice
[546.18 --> 547.34]  that opens us up
[547.34 --> 548.78]  to see that
[548.78 --> 549.98]  is gratitude.
[550.98 --> 551.50]  And services
[551.50 --> 552.80]  like Thanksgiving Sunday
[552.80 --> 553.66]  are services
[553.66 --> 554.90]  where we collectively say
[554.90 --> 555.86]  we're going to stop,
[556.34 --> 557.02]  take stock,
[557.50 --> 559.16]  and give thanks.
[560.76 --> 561.24]  Now,
[561.36 --> 562.32]  what Jonathan opened up
[562.32 --> 562.76]  last week,
[562.80 --> 563.28]  if you were here,
[563.88 --> 564.78]  is that the book of James
[564.78 --> 566.22]  has a real keen interest
[566.22 --> 567.20]  in justice and mercy
[567.20 --> 567.88]  towards a vulnerable.
[568.64 --> 569.22]  That's one of the reasons
[569.22 --> 570.08]  we lined up this interview
[570.08 --> 571.10]  on the Cloverdale Community Kitchen
[571.10 --> 571.84]  with this Sunday.
[572.48 --> 572.78]  James,
[573.08 --> 573.58]  first of all,
[573.62 --> 574.66]  says God is generous,
[574.78 --> 575.36]  He's reliable,
[575.46 --> 575.90]  He's the source
[575.90 --> 578.02]  of every single good gift
[578.02 --> 578.64]  in your life.
[578.96 --> 579.80]  But then he says
[579.80 --> 580.36]  the religion
[580.36 --> 581.66]  that God wants to see,
[582.22 --> 582.92]  the religion that's pure
[582.92 --> 583.34]  and faultless,
[583.44 --> 584.52]  the religion where the widows
[584.52 --> 585.28]  are taken care of
[585.28 --> 586.00]  and the orphans
[586.00 --> 586.60]  are taken care of.
[586.62 --> 587.40]  And as Jonathan touched on
[587.40 --> 587.74]  last week,
[587.98 --> 589.16]  where there's no favoritism
[589.16 --> 590.18]  showed towards the wealthy
[590.18 --> 591.42]  because there's just as much
[591.42 --> 592.32]  compassion, love,
[592.46 --> 593.32]  and enfolding
[593.32 --> 594.12]  of those who are poor
[594.12 --> 594.66]  and marginalized
[594.66 --> 595.32]  in the community.
[595.98 --> 596.76]  And I think
[596.76 --> 597.68]  there's a connection here.
[598.48 --> 600.02]  I think people
[600.02 --> 600.78]  who see
[600.78 --> 601.74]  where all the good things
[601.74 --> 602.26]  come from,
[602.38 --> 603.84]  the source of every good gift,
[604.22 --> 604.98]  are also people
[604.98 --> 605.56]  who learn
[605.56 --> 606.52]  how to share
[606.52 --> 607.24]  the blessing
[607.24 --> 608.92]  with those in need.
[609.68 --> 610.36]  I think people
[610.36 --> 611.68]  who practice generosity
[611.68 --> 612.64]  are people
[612.64 --> 613.64]  who begin to mirror
[613.64 --> 614.88]  God's generosity.
[614.88 --> 615.56]  Would you agree?
[616.56 --> 617.26]  Because I don't think
[617.26 --> 618.16]  ingratitude
[618.16 --> 619.52]  fosters generosity.
[620.16 --> 620.60]  I think people
[620.60 --> 621.18]  who are whining
[621.18 --> 622.38]  and wishing they had more
[622.38 --> 623.22]  and comparing themselves
[623.22 --> 624.12]  to those who have more
[624.12 --> 624.80]  are the people
[624.80 --> 625.64]  who are like giving
[625.64 --> 626.96]  of what they have
[626.96 --> 628.58]  to those who may have need.
[628.58 --> 630.12]  I think people
[630.12 --> 630.86]  who know the source
[630.86 --> 631.62]  of their strength,
[632.54 --> 633.72]  the source of their health,
[634.48 --> 635.76]  the source of the job
[635.76 --> 636.28]  they got,
[636.96 --> 638.58]  the source of the money
[638.58 --> 639.30]  they have,
[639.80 --> 640.98]  the house they live in.
[641.04 --> 641.94]  When people recognize
[641.94 --> 642.56]  that all those
[642.56 --> 643.10]  are good gifts
[643.10 --> 644.04]  not from your own hands
[644.04 --> 644.86]  but from the Father,
[645.26 --> 645.74]  all of a sudden
[645.74 --> 646.72]  you want to be open-handed
[646.72 --> 647.72]  to share what God
[647.72 --> 648.34]  has given you.
[649.96 --> 651.62]  Those who practice gratitude
[651.62 --> 653.14]  and see that the source
[653.14 --> 653.92]  of all good things
[653.92 --> 654.34]  they have
[654.34 --> 655.10]  are from the Father
[655.10 --> 656.52]  begin to mirror
[656.52 --> 657.30]  his generosity
[657.30 --> 658.28]  around them.
[658.88 --> 659.32]  And I'll tell you
[659.32 --> 659.72]  there's people
[659.72 --> 660.32]  in this church
[660.32 --> 660.96]  who I've seen
[660.96 --> 662.36]  do that very thing.
[663.04 --> 663.98]  That the generous heart
[663.98 --> 664.38]  of the Father
[664.38 --> 665.86]  is displayed in your life
[665.86 --> 666.64]  as you welcome people
[666.64 --> 667.16]  into your home,
[667.26 --> 667.72]  as you serve
[667.72 --> 668.50]  at the community kitchen,
[668.64 --> 669.34]  as you write letters
[669.34 --> 670.32]  to those who are in jail,
[670.58 --> 671.76]  as you go to Adams Road
[671.76 --> 672.32]  and help out
[672.32 --> 673.32]  with the breakfast program
[673.32 --> 674.36]  or provide help
[674.36 --> 675.02]  to those who are struggling
[675.02 --> 675.68]  with mental health.
[675.74 --> 676.72]  I've seen the way
[676.72 --> 677.78]  the generous character
[677.78 --> 678.26]  of the Father
[678.26 --> 679.06]  is mirrored
[679.06 --> 680.20]  in this church.
[682.12 --> 682.92]  Now interestingly
[682.92 --> 683.80]  when I was reading
[683.80 --> 684.62]  on the book of James
[684.62 --> 685.62]  this passage
[685.62 --> 686.42]  that we're looking at
[686.42 --> 687.78]  connects to two passages
[687.78 --> 688.76]  in the book of Deuteronomy
[688.76 --> 689.30]  which is a book
[689.30 --> 691.14]  where Moses is preparing Israel
[691.14 --> 692.88]  to go to the abundant land
[692.88 --> 693.32]  of Canaan.
[693.70 --> 694.18]  He's sort of giving
[694.18 --> 695.12]  the last pep talk
[695.12 --> 696.04]  on how to follow God
[696.04 --> 697.08]  and not forget him
[697.08 --> 697.86]  when they enter
[697.86 --> 698.84]  into this abundant land
[698.84 --> 699.90]  flowing with milk and honey.
[700.48 --> 702.18]  And there's some interesting laws
[702.18 --> 702.78]  in Deuteronomy.
[702.84 --> 703.46]  If you've ever read it
[703.46 --> 704.58]  you know that some of the laws
[704.58 --> 705.14]  in Deuteronomy
[705.14 --> 705.98]  you're going to like this
[705.98 --> 708.48]  make mandatory feasting.
[709.52 --> 710.56]  They command
[710.56 --> 712.34]  that the people of God
[712.34 --> 712.94]  stop,
[713.30 --> 714.24]  they take in the harvest,
[714.24 --> 715.18]  they give to God
[715.18 --> 716.48]  what has been given to them
[716.48 --> 717.58]  and they give thanks.
[717.90 --> 718.52]  What do you think of that?
[719.30 --> 720.38]  In fact I want to read for you
[720.38 --> 721.40]  some of the law
[721.40 --> 722.56]  around the feast of weeks.
[722.70 --> 723.26]  This is found
[723.26 --> 725.42]  in Deuteronomy 16 verse 9.
[726.38 --> 727.44]  Command to the community.
[727.44 --> 729.54]  Count off seven weeks
[729.54 --> 730.84]  from the time you begin
[730.84 --> 731.80]  and put a sickle
[731.80 --> 732.94]  to the standing grain.
[733.70 --> 734.74]  Then celebrate
[734.74 --> 735.52]  the feast of weeks
[735.52 --> 736.40]  to the Lord your God
[736.40 --> 737.88]  by giving a freewill offering
[737.88 --> 738.44]  in proportion
[738.44 --> 739.20]  to the blessings
[739.20 --> 740.04]  the Lord your God
[740.04 --> 740.72]  has given you.
[741.38 --> 742.18]  And rejoice
[742.18 --> 743.82]  before the Lord your God
[743.82 --> 744.34]  at the place
[744.34 --> 745.08]  he will choose
[745.08 --> 745.62]  as a dwelling
[745.62 --> 746.38]  for his name.
[747.00 --> 747.32]  You,
[747.76 --> 748.68]  your sons and daughters,
[748.94 --> 750.18]  your male and female servants,
[750.52 --> 751.54]  the Levites in your town,
[751.62 --> 752.28]  and the foreigners,
[752.50 --> 753.22]  the fatherless,
[753.32 --> 753.80]  the widows
[753.80 --> 755.34]  living among you.
[755.34 --> 756.74]  And here's the movement
[756.74 --> 757.70]  of the Old Testament feast,
[757.76 --> 758.48]  especially this one.
[758.78 --> 759.30]  Number one,
[759.86 --> 760.86]  they start by remembering
[760.86 --> 761.54]  who God is
[761.54 --> 762.12]  and what he's done.
[762.28 --> 762.66]  He's the one
[762.66 --> 763.10]  who brought them
[763.10 --> 764.30]  as a tiny little slave nation
[764.30 --> 765.34]  out of Egyptian slavery
[765.34 --> 766.78]  and planted them
[766.78 --> 767.96]  in this abundant place
[767.96 --> 768.56]  called Canaan.
[768.64 --> 769.30]  That's all him,
[769.44 --> 769.82]  not them.
[770.54 --> 770.94]  Secondly,
[771.38 --> 772.06]  they're required
[772.06 --> 773.20]  to celebrate.
[774.38 --> 774.94]  They're required
[774.94 --> 775.60]  to stop,
[775.94 --> 777.12]  bring some of that food together,
[777.48 --> 778.20]  show God
[778.20 --> 779.02]  how good he's been
[779.02 --> 780.94]  by enjoying the food.
[781.28 --> 781.78]  Isn't that good?
[782.44 --> 783.08]  And they celebrate
[783.08 --> 783.76]  with food,
[783.84 --> 784.62]  they celebrate with drink,
[784.62 --> 785.58]  and they recognize again
[785.58 --> 786.62]  that God is faithful
[786.62 --> 787.14]  and provides.
[789.46 --> 789.86]  Thirdly,
[790.66 --> 791.74]  they become generous
[791.74 --> 793.28]  and they enfold
[793.28 --> 794.42]  into that feast,
[794.54 --> 795.30]  into that meal,
[795.50 --> 796.02]  the widows,
[797.62 --> 798.18]  the fatherless,
[798.28 --> 798.62]  the orphan,
[798.70 --> 799.28]  the outsiders,
[799.44 --> 799.88]  the foreigners
[799.88 --> 800.84]  are all brought in
[800.84 --> 801.74]  and cared for
[801.74 --> 803.22]  as part of their community.
[804.46 --> 805.30]  The kids are coming,
[805.36 --> 805.82]  I can hear it.
[805.84 --> 807.56]  I gotta close this sermon up here.
[809.46 --> 810.48]  And I just want to say
[810.48 --> 811.24]  that in conclusion,
[811.24 --> 816.38]  that the book of James
[816.38 --> 817.62]  mirrors this teaching,
[818.72 --> 819.32]  James is saying,
[819.46 --> 820.58]  remember that every single
[820.58 --> 821.56]  good gift you experience
[821.56 --> 822.30]  is from the father.
[822.42 --> 823.48]  Do not be deceived
[823.48 --> 824.22]  about his character.
[824.42 --> 825.12]  He is reliable,
[825.54 --> 826.26]  he is consistent,
[826.40 --> 826.94]  he is generous,
[827.04 --> 828.14]  and he is good.
[829.60 --> 829.98]  Secondly,
[830.74 --> 832.32]  celebrate that goodness.
[833.42 --> 834.78]  Celebrate the abundant provision.
[834.94 --> 835.66]  That's what we're doing
[835.66 --> 836.58]  this morning.
[837.48 --> 838.04]  And thirdly,
[838.34 --> 840.74]  share to those in your city,
[840.86 --> 841.64]  to those in your community,
[841.72 --> 842.64]  to those in your family
[842.64 --> 843.40]  who have need
[843.40 --> 844.38]  with the way that God
[844.38 --> 845.26]  has taken care of you.
[845.32 --> 846.30]  Or to summarize the way
[846.30 --> 847.28]  we put it many times,
[847.76 --> 849.04]  we are blessed hope
[849.04 --> 851.68]  so that we can be a blessing.
[852.42 --> 853.32]  And I'm just gonna finish
[853.32 --> 853.84]  it right there.
[855.40 --> 855.76]  Amen.
[857.58 --> 858.18]  Our children,
[858.24 --> 858.92]  I'll just give our children
[858.92 --> 859.78]  a minute to join us
[859.78 --> 860.32]  because I want them
[860.32 --> 861.50]  to be here for our communion.
[864.30 --> 864.62]  Children,
[864.72 --> 865.38]  we're so thankful.
[865.38 --> 865.44]  people,
[865.96 --> 866.68]  you can join us
[866.68 --> 867.22]  for this meal.
[872.06 --> 872.64]  You'll notice
[872.64 --> 873.32]  that we've organized
[873.32 --> 873.84]  the sanctuary
[873.84 --> 874.60]  a little bit differently
[874.60 --> 875.14]  this Sunday.
[875.44 --> 877.04]  And we have all the bread
[877.04 --> 878.34]  and the juice
[878.34 --> 879.56]  and all the stuff
[879.56 --> 879.98]  in the middle
[879.98 --> 881.30]  because what we want
[881.30 --> 882.18]  to do with communion today
[882.18 --> 882.72]  is we actually want
[882.72 --> 883.58]  to slow it down.
[884.46 --> 885.40]  We want to make this
[885.40 --> 886.34]  a little bit more
[886.34 --> 887.40]  like a family meal.
[887.64 --> 888.14]  And so you'll see
[888.14 --> 889.14]  that there's big chunks
[889.14 --> 889.60]  of bread.
[889.94 --> 890.66]  And if you're a family,
[890.72 --> 891.46]  you can take a big chunk
[891.46 --> 892.12]  of bread and share it
[892.12 --> 892.58]  with your kids
[892.58 --> 893.14]  and your spouse.
[893.14 --> 893.88]  Or if you're single
[893.88 --> 894.34]  and hungry,
[894.48 --> 895.22]  you take a big chunk
[895.22 --> 895.66]  of bread and you just
[895.66 --> 896.38]  eat that all by yourself.
[897.10 --> 898.46]  No judgment whatsoever.
[898.58 --> 899.24]  It's 11 a.m.
[899.94 --> 900.78]  There's also juice,
[900.88 --> 901.96]  the glasses for the adults,
[902.10 --> 903.32]  the plastic for the kids.
[903.40 --> 903.94]  And what we want you
[903.94 --> 904.74]  to do is to grab
[904.74 --> 905.28]  those things,
[905.40 --> 906.30]  go back to your seat.
[906.74 --> 907.92]  I'm going to lead us
[907.92 --> 910.46]  in a point of celebration
[910.46 --> 912.16]  for what Christ
[912.16 --> 912.98]  has done for us.
[913.02 --> 913.48]  Our celebration
[913.48 --> 914.06]  is going to center
[914.06 --> 914.90]  around what Christ
[914.90 --> 915.56]  has done on the cross.
[915.56 --> 917.30]  And then we're going
[917.30 --> 918.02]  to take some time,
[918.16 --> 918.94]  keep eating the bread,
[919.10 --> 919.94]  keep taking the juice,
[920.00 --> 920.88]  and I've got a microphone
[920.88 --> 921.58]  here somewhere,
[922.02 --> 922.70]  and we're going to invite
[922.70 --> 923.78]  anyone who feels comfortable
[923.78 --> 925.46]  to share their words
[925.46 --> 925.96]  of gratitude,
[926.52 --> 927.26]  to share how you've
[927.26 --> 928.04]  experienced the provision
[928.04 --> 928.44]  of God,
[928.52 --> 929.34]  the goodness of God
[929.34 --> 930.00]  in this season,
[930.00 --> 931.92]  and bless the church body
[931.92 --> 933.50]  with how you've experienced
[933.50 --> 934.20]  in real time
[934.20 --> 934.92]  in your life
[934.92 --> 936.52]  the character of God.
[936.60 --> 937.20]  Does that sound good?
[938.34 --> 939.32]  And just so you know,
[939.42 --> 940.40]  I know we get nervous
[940.40 --> 941.06]  around microphones,
[941.28 --> 941.94]  but there are times
[941.94 --> 943.40]  where it's worth sharing
[943.40 --> 944.34]  even if you're nervous
[944.34 --> 945.90]  so that the community
[945.90 --> 946.60]  can hear the way
[946.60 --> 947.22]  you've experienced
[947.22 --> 948.12]  the goodness of God.
[948.82 --> 950.16]  So take your time,
[950.26 --> 950.92]  come to the center,
[951.06 --> 951.94]  grab a chunk of bread,
[952.24 --> 952.78]  there's gluten-free
[952.78 --> 953.54]  on the little table,
[953.72 --> 954.36]  and then juice,
[954.56 --> 955.22]  find your way back
[955.22 --> 955.58]  to your seat,
[955.64 --> 956.50]  and I will lead us
[956.50 --> 957.46]  through communion, okay?
[957.80 --> 958.72]  Let's do that together.
