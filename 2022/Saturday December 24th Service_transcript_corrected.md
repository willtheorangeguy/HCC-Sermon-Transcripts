[0.00 → 4.20] I feel like I want to say at the outset a thank you to Pastor Sid. Last year, you might not know
[4.20 → 10.36] this, but right before Christmas Eve, I got COVID, and I was in isolation. I just told Pastor Sid,
[10.44 → 14.92] hey, you're up for Christmas Eve, and I just relaxed in isolation. So now he gets to have
[14.92 → 21.32] a Saturday off. We're going to continue something we started a few weeks ago already.
[22.34 → 26.30] We've, over the course of Advent, been travelling and reflecting on some of the names
[26.30 → 30.78] that Jesus has been given, names that were prophesied about Jesus hundreds of years
[30.78 → 37.44] before he was even born, names like Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Prince of Peace, Everlasting
[37.44 → 41.92] Father. And this evening, we're going to look at one more name that was prophesied in Isaiah
[41.92 → 47.12] and also shows up in Matthew, and that is the name Emmanuel. I'm going to read for us how
[47.12 → 49.46] Matthew speaks of it in Matthew chapter 1.
[49.46 → 58.04] Thus, there were 14 generations in all from Abraham to David, 14 from David to the exile
[58.04 → 64.72] to Babylon, and 14 from exile to the Messiah. This is how the birth of Jesus, the Messiah,
[64.88 → 70.14] came about. His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together,
[70.24 → 75.22] she found out she was pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph, her husband, was a
[75.22 → 79.98] righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her
[79.98 → 85.56] quietly. But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,
[85.96 → 92.12] Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived
[92.12 → 98.10] in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus,
[98.72 → 104.70] because he will save his people from their sins. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said
[104.70 → 109.52] through the prophet. The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him
[109.52 → 113.08] Emmanuel, which means God with us.
[116.68 → 120.88] Over the last number of weeks, I've been asking people in our community what they're looking forward
[120.88 → 125.58] to over the Christmas break. And some of the children that I asked that question to, they said
[125.58 → 129.08] to me that they're looking forward to spending quality time with their mom and their dad.
[129.08 → 135.86] I'm joking, they actually did not say that. You know exactly what they said. Presence.
[137.24 → 140.56] But one day they might say that. I asked some of our university students what they're looking
[140.56 → 147.08] forward to over the Christmas break. You know what they said? Rest. Almost everyone else that I asked
[147.08 → 151.80] that question to, they answered with something along the same lines. They look forward to spending time
[151.80 → 156.82] with family. And I do think that's one of the great gifts this time of year brings for all of us.
[156.82 → 161.24] People take time off work. They often pack up their cars or get on a plane. They travel a great
[161.24 → 164.88] distance to spend time with their families, to decorate their homes, to set the table,
[165.04 → 170.66] to celebrate Christ's birth with a feast with the people they love. That's a gift of this season,
[170.74 → 176.68] to be with those whom we love. And I happen to think that actually gets at the heart of what
[176.68 → 182.72] Christmas is, what the name of Jesus is all about. You could say that Emmanuel is about God
[182.72 → 191.84] travelling a great distance to be with us. God moving into our lives to be present to us.
[193.18 → 197.24] Do you know what one of the most prominent promises that God makes in the Bible is?
[198.70 → 203.26] You might guess that a good repetitive promise that God makes is, I'll forgive you. And that's true.
[203.46 → 208.74] It's very repeated in the Bible. Another very common promise is, do not be afraid, which actually
[208.74 → 214.36] shows up in our passage. But the most common promise that we see throughout the biblical story
[214.36 → 221.10] that God makes to His people is, I'll be with you. The thing that God says to generation after
[221.10 → 228.16] generation of people is, I will be with you. And that to me says a lot about the character of our
[228.16 → 233.04] Heavenly Father. It tells me about His heart, that He's not just interested in giving us things to do,
[233.04 → 237.42] or He's interested in regulations for our lives. He's interested in relationship with His world and
[237.42 → 244.30] with His children that He created. Like a good father, He wants to be with us. And a few weeks
[244.30 → 249.58] ago, my wife brought home an Advent book for kids called The Story of God With Us. And quite masterfully,
[249.74 → 254.58] this children's book told the whole story of the Bible through the lens of the promise,
[255.16 → 258.68] I will be with you from beginning to end. And I'm just going to give a piece of that,
[258.68 → 265.14] not from the book, my own way of telling the story this evening. The story of the Bible starts not
[265.14 → 271.16] with God just creating a world for humans to inhabit, but a world for Him to dwell with them in.
[271.98 → 276.14] In the opening chapters, quite remarkably, and in contrast to many other creation accounts,
[276.28 → 281.34] we have a picture of God walking in the garden with the humans He created, speaking with them,
[281.50 → 285.60] conversing with them, being in relationship with them. There's a sense of closeness there.
[285.60 → 290.82] And even after the rebellion, after they made choices to run their lives without His control,
[290.96 → 297.96] to reject His loving authority, we see God caring for them, God clothing them, God calling out to
[297.96 → 303.90] them again and again. And as the story continues, you see this thing called sin bringing havoc and
[303.90 → 309.74] destructive and division in the world, yet God continues to call out, calling out to Abraham,
[309.98 → 315.48] bringing Abraham to himself, saying, Abraham, I will be with you. I'm going to be your
[315.48 → 320.16] God. You're going to know my ways. Through you, I'm going to form a people, Israel, and they're
[320.16 → 326.40] going to know me. And the world through them is going to see my love. God then rescues that little
[326.40 → 332.78] group of Israelites from slavery, places them in this abundant land of Canaan, and then dwells
[332.78 → 340.10] with them in the temple. I will be with you. That cycle continues of running from their father,
[340.10 → 345.84] of finding some source of life outside of him. And God sends prophets. He sends kings. He sends
[345.84 → 352.22] judges to reveal to the people God's love and to remind them that God seeks to be with them.
[353.34 → 359.02] The Old Testament story closes with God's people choosing again to run from Him, to do live on their
[359.02 → 365.08] own, and they find themselves back in slavery, back in subjugation, back in difficulty. But not without
[365.08 → 373.42] the promise that God makes again to the prophets, I will be with you. And then we get to the New
[373.42 → 379.72] Testament 400 years later, and we have these four writers who put their quill to scroll, and they start
[379.72 → 384.84] telling the story of a baby. They start telling the story of this blue-collar couple in obscurity
[384.84 → 391.64] taking in their lives this child who, in the minds of these writers, is going to bring life to the world.
[391.64 → 398.78] Interestingly, if you look at Matthew, he starts his account of Jesus' life with a genealogy.
[399.56 → 402.96] Now, in my opinion, that is not the most riveting way to start a book. That's not going to catch my
[402.96 → 407.48] attention very long. And it's not because Matthew is one of those ancestry people, right? Do you have
[407.48 → 411.46] those ancestry people in your family? They're going to take the test, and they're going to tell you
[411.46 → 416.20] their lineage, and they're going to tell you your lineage. But Matthew's not doing this because he's
[416.20 → 421.16] interested in genealogy. He's doing this because he wants us to understand the story that makes sense of
[421.16 → 427.20] Jesus' life. More than that, he wants us to understand what it is that Jesus is fulfilling. And that's why he
[427.20 → 435.88] writes in verse 22, all this took place to what? Fulfill what the Lord had said to the prophet, that's Isaiah.
[436.44 → 444.12] The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel. He will save his people
[444.12 → 451.16] from their sins. Did you see it? Right there. Matthew is not just saying, hey, this is a story
[451.16 → 457.64] that makes sense of Jesus' lineage. This is Jesus making good on the promise God makes to be with his
[457.64 → 463.96] people. This is God doing what God always does. And this time, he showed up in the way no one expected.
[465.24 → 469.96] And the writers of the New Testament want everyone to know that the child in the manger
[469.96 → 476.68] is God in the flesh. And the reason we gather year after year, and we sing our songs and we sort of
[476.68 → 483.48] marvel in the mystery of Christ's birth is because we truly believe that God travelled a great distance.
[484.28 → 493.40] And in Christ's birth, he's with us. He's come to us to reveal who he is and the depth of his love.
[493.40 → 501.88] Now this week, I was reading an article on Advent by a woman. And to give an illustration of what she
[501.88 → 505.56] was trying to talk about, she gave this story from her own life. It's a story of her dating this young
[505.56 → 509.88] guy. They knew each other in high school. They started dating in university. And as life often goes,
[510.36 → 514.12] their lives went on very different paths. She went off travelling. He went off to a different state to
[514.12 → 518.12] study in university. And they went back to their own families for Christmas in different states.
[518.44 → 522.52] And they were sort of talking on the phone. And in this phone conversation, she was expressing the
[522.52 → 526.12] difficulty of being in a long distance relationship. Some of you might know about this.
[526.12 → 529.32] She shared about some of the stuff that was coming up that you need to talk through and just the
[529.32 → 533.72] fragility of being at a distance from one another. And then that was the end of that phone call.
[534.44 → 537.72] The next night, she goes out for dinner with her family. She comes back home and then there's a
[537.72 → 544.12] knock at the door. You know where this is going. She opens the door and there is her boyfriend,
[544.92 → 552.20] standing sheepishly, grinning triumphantly, because he so surprised her. He travelled for 10
[552.20 → 557.40] straight hours from that last conversation. He took a train. Furthermore, he took a bus. Furthermore, he took a taxi. Furthermore, he
[557.40 → 563.80] even hitched a ride from a friend of her mom's so he could get on her doorstep and show up in person.
[564.68 → 569.08] And the reason is he knew after the last conversation, after he felt the fragility of
[569.08 → 573.64] the relationship, that she didn't need a card. She didn't need another bouquet of flowers. She didn't
[573.64 → 579.80] need another phone call. She needed him to show up in person and communicate with his body the depth of
[579.80 → 587.00] his love for her and how much he cares about her. I want to read for us now her Advent reflections on
[587.00 → 593.80] this experience. She writes, my boyfriend showed up on my doorstep because he knew that his presence
[593.80 → 600.60] was the only way I would be convinced of his heart. It was inefficient. It was impractical.
[600.60 → 608.84] And it was totally worth it. Does God communicate to us through physical presence,
[610.20 → 617.24] through travelling the great distance? Does God communicate to us in this inefficient, impractical,
[617.24 → 622.36] and costly way? Christians throughout the generations believe that the answer to this
[622.36 → 631.88] question is a resounding yes. When Christ comes in this manger born in obscurity and in humility,
[631.88 → 638.20] God is revealing His love to the world. He wants every person to see Him, to hear Him, to touch Him,
[638.20 → 646.36] to dine with Him as He enters into this world and through Him to know that God is a God who seeks to
[646.36 → 655.32] be with us. Now, you need to know the story doesn't finish with Jesus' birth or even His life. And one of
[655.32 → 660.84] the intriguing things, at least to me about Jesus' life, is that He does not, as the Son of God, as deity
[660.84 → 666.12] in humanity, He does not get a pass on the hardship and the difficulty of life. Jesus walks through all
[666.12 → 672.44] the same mire and muck and pain and heartache as all of us do. Jesus experienced what it was like to see
[672.44 → 678.92] a diseased body. He experienced what it was like to sit at the tomb of a friend He had and loved and
[678.92 → 684.92] weep over the reality of death. Jesus experienced people resisting Him, resenting Him, calling Him a
[684.92 → 690.92] liar. He experienced many people just walk away from Him and abandon Him. And the reason that is all part
[690.92 → 695.64] of the plan. He was never sent to just observe our lives from a distance or watch the difficulty we go
[695.64 → 702.36] through with a lack of concern. He was sent to deal with all of that. And tonight, I want to underscore
[702.36 → 710.04] that the Son of God who came in the cradle came to rescue us and bring us home. And when I say that,
[710.04 → 716.28] I meant Christ was sent to deal with the distance between us and our Heavenly Father. He was sent to
[716.28 → 722.68] deal with the division that we experience between each other, family members, and friends. He was sent to
[722.68 → 729.16] deal with the conflict and all the distorted desires that keep us from being the true selves we were created
[729.16 → 736.12] to be. Christ was sent. He was travelling the distance to bring about reconciliation.
[737.56 → 743.48] And ultimately, it was His death and resurrection that brought about that healing. The cradle always
[743.48 → 748.12] leads to the cross, the incarnation to the crucifixion, and in Jesus' death and resurrection,
[748.76 → 755.80] our healing is made possible. In Jesus' death and resurrection, the distance between us and the Father
[755.80 → 762.76] is bridged by His life. And in Jesus' death and resurrection, our wholeness is now available to us.
[768.28 → 773.96] When Jesus rises from the dead after leaving the power of sin, the divisive, distorting power of sin
[773.96 → 780.84] below and beneath Him, the invitation goes out in His resurrection to come home. Jesus, who's now
[780.84 → 787.08] crossed the distance, who's come all the way to us, now invites us to live beautiful relationship with
[787.08 → 793.24] the Father, to be reconciled and reconnected to those around us by His power, by His strength,
[793.24 → 800.12] and become our true selves we are created to be through faith. By receiving Him as our Lord, by
[800.12 → 806.28] receiving Him as our Saviour, and watching His healing power, His resurrection life become our healing power,
[806.28 → 813.16] our resurrection life. The resurrection sort of undoes that pattern of running, that pattern of
[813.16 → 819.24] seeking to run our lives without God's love, and brings us to the place we were created to be in.
[820.12 → 828.92] Brings us home, at peace with the Father, at peace with one another, at peace even in ourselves, tasting the
[828.92 → 836.12] way all of us were created to live from the beginning, dwelling in the presence of God, and a glimpse of
[836.12 → 843.32] the way that we will live when Christ returns. One of the things I try to say at every Advent series,
[843.32 → 849.16] or at every Christmas Eve service, is that Advent is to kindle our hope for the future. We not only
[849.16 → 853.96] look back on what happened in the cradle, and that God came in the flesh through Jesus, but we are waiting
[853.96 → 859.72] with anticipation for that Jesus to return as a King of glory. You see, the biblical story is not one we
[859.72 → 865.88] just look back on, it's one that we actually live in, and the future of is still coming. And do you
[865.88 → 873.56] know how the story ends? I'm going to give it away for you. The story ends with God dwelling with us.
[874.20 → 879.64] The story of the Bible ends with God in glory and power, bringing restoration to His world,
[879.64 → 885.40] reconciliation to where all the broken pieces and all the darkness lies, and restoration.
[885.40 → 891.88] Let me read for you how Revelation gives us the end of the story. John looks up, and he sees a new heaven,
[891.88 → 895.88] and a new earth, a new Jerusalem coming down from heaven, and this is what he writes. He says,
[895.88 → 901.88] look, God's dwelling place is now among the people, and God will dwell with them.
[902.92 → 908.12] They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear
[908.12 → 916.20] from their eyes. There will be no more death, no more crying, no more mourning, and no more pain,
[916.20 → 921.56] for the old order of things has passed away. And then John writes, Jesus' perspective,
[921.56 → 929.96] behold, I am making everything new. Our story begins with God dwelling with us.
[929.96 → 937.00] God with us. It comes at the centre with Jesus showing up in the flesh with us, and it ends gloriously
[937.00 → 946.12] with God in glory and power dwelling with us. Emmanuel, God with us. Let's pray together.
[949.64 → 955.16] Father, we thank You for Your Word, and we thank You for Your commitment to Your world and to Your people.
[955.16 → 962.28] We thank You that You relentlessly pursue us with grace and power and love, that You cross the great
[962.28 → 969.48] distance so that we might know You and be known by You. We pray that You're healing, reconciling power
[970.28 → 975.64] would bring healing to the places of pain and division in our lives. We pray that we live in the
[975.64 → 982.60] peace You give such that wherever we go, the light of Christ shines brightly. We thank You that our hope is
[982.60 → 987.32] secure, and that day is coming where there will be a new heaven and a new earth, and we will dwell
[987.32 → 996.20] forever in Your presence. God with us. Amen. So we have a bit of a tradition at Hope, if you've been to
[996.20 → 1002.44] our Christmas Eve services before, that we light candles together and we sing O Holy Night. Now, if you
[1002.44 → 1006.68] don't know this, the reason we light candles at Christmas is that candles for the long history of the
[1006.68 → 1012.28] church represent the presence of Christ. And we think no better way to be reminded of and to teach
[1012.28 → 1017.32] ourselves that Christ is present with us than to hold a candle right in front of us and to sing of
[1017.32 → 1021.88] the presence of Christ together. So I'm going to light a candle from the Christ candle, and I'm just
[1021.88 → 1026.36] going to go to the people near me in the front, and I invite you to light the candles of those who are
[1026.36 → 1030.60] around you. And if there are people on the other side of the aisle, if you could light their candles,
[1030.60 → 1034.36] that'd be great because I don't want to have one bright section and two dark sections. It's a bad symbol.
[1034.36 → 1039.72] And I also just want to say, after coming back from the 4 p.m. service, if you've got little people
[1039.72 → 1044.20] who have candles, just keep an eye on them because we had some candles turned into swords, and it was an
[1044.20 → 1050.76] interesting service. Young parents, you know what I'm talking about. We trust you. We trust you.
