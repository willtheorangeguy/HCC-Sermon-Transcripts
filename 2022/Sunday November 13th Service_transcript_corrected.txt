[0.00 → 3.98] Well, we are going to continue our series in the book of James.
[4.06 → 6.78] This is actually the second last sermon in our series.
[7.66 → 10.68] And James packs a lot in at the end, as we're going to see.
[11.38 → 13.82] And this is actually a passage I've wanted to preach on for a while
[13.82 → 15.30] because I had lots of questions about it.
[15.32 → 20.58] And so you get to be part of my journey of dealing with what is a very jam-packed passage
[20.58 → 21.88] on the topic of prayer.
[22.48 → 25.30] So if you have your Bible with you, turn with me to James 5,
[25.62 → 27.74] and we're going to read verse 13 to 18 together.
[30.00 → 35.66] Is anyone among you in trouble?
[36.40 → 37.66] Let them pray.
[38.48 → 39.74] Is anyone happy?
[40.44 → 42.18] Let them sing songs of praise.
[42.86 → 44.70] Is anyone among you sick?
[45.48 → 47.76] Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them
[47.76 → 49.92] and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.
[50.40 → 53.46] And the prayer offered in faith will make them well.
[54.08 → 55.42] The Lord will raise them up.
[56.14 → 58.06] If they've sinned, they'll be forgiven.
[58.06 → 62.26] Therefore, confess your sins to each other and pray for each other
[62.26 → 63.78] so that you may be healed.
[64.44 → 67.86] The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
[69.08 → 71.34] Elijah was a human being, even as we are.
[71.86 → 73.46] He prayed earnestly that it would not rain,
[73.50 → 76.20] and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.
[76.86 → 79.02] Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain,
[79.34 → 81.50] and the earth produced its crops.
[81.50 → 89.68] When people go on a journey of exploring the Christian faith
[89.68 → 92.42] and understanding what it is that Christians believe
[92.42 → 94.04] and what it is that Christians practice,
[94.42 → 97.72] one of the very curious, intriguing, and beautiful things
[97.72 → 100.84] that they come into contact with is prayer.
[100.84 → 105.04] They learn that there's this person, that is God,
[105.56 → 107.46] who relates to us as a heavenly father,
[107.56 → 109.12] and this God you can speak with,
[109.70 → 112.42] you can converse with, and you can listen to.
[113.16 → 114.66] And if you didn't grow up in the church
[114.66 → 116.12] and you just discover that,
[116.60 → 118.36] that's a beautiful thing.
[119.60 → 121.58] In fact, I still remember, I've shared before,
[121.72 → 124.20] how there's a young woman who was learning about the Christian faith.
[124.30 → 124.96] I was getting to know her.
[125.02 → 126.20] She was a student at SFU,
[126.20 → 128.04] and she had prayed for the first time,
[128.12 → 129.16] and her prayer was just,
[129.58 → 130.06] hey God,
[130.64 → 131.76] and she shared some of her thoughts,
[131.80 → 132.86] and she finished by saying,
[133.48 → 133.74] bye,
[134.60 → 135.96] and it was beautiful.
[136.62 → 139.34] And she was learning this rich thing that we call prayer.
[140.56 → 142.90] Eugene Peterson, a favourite writer of mine,
[142.98 → 145.76] talks about prayer as one of the most important things
[145.76 → 147.94] that we can do and teach in the church.
[148.40 → 149.52] In fact, he would say that, you know,
[149.52 → 151.14] one of the things that we need to learn very intentionally
[151.14 → 152.52] about how to form our children in
[152.52 → 154.88] and form youth in is prayer.
[154.88 → 154.96] Prayer.
[155.52 → 156.86] And the reason he says that is because
[156.86 → 159.58] if it's true that you and I were created to live
[159.58 → 162.44] in this unbroken relationship with our Heavenly Father
[162.44 → 164.46] and know His heart and hear from Him,
[165.10 → 167.30] the way we do that is prayer.
[168.14 → 169.32] It is, as he describes it,
[169.36 → 171.74] the language of the Christian faith.
[172.06 → 173.34] And he gives this image where he says,
[173.40 → 174.48] you know if you go to France,
[175.06 → 176.28] you learn French.
[176.82 → 178.50] If you go to Brazil, you learn Portuguese.
[178.66 → 180.40] If you become a Christian, you learn to pray.
[181.32 → 183.16] It's the language of the Christian faith.
[183.16 → 186.02] We get to speak with our Heavenly Father.
[187.26 → 189.82] This passage that James is teaching on
[189.82 → 191.82] focuses on prayer.
[192.14 → 192.92] And as I already mentioned,
[193.00 → 195.50] he packs a lot in this short passage
[195.50 → 196.12] as we're going to see.
[196.18 → 198.44] He covers four key elements of prayer.
[198.56 → 199.82] He gives wisdom on four dimensions,
[199.94 → 201.16] you might say, of prayer.
[201.24 → 202.10] And they are as follows.
[202.18 → 204.84] The first is, when you are in trouble,
[205.68 → 206.18] you pray.
[206.56 → 207.52] Praying through your adversity.
[207.52 → 210.42] The second is, when you are sick,
[210.92 → 212.08] you go and receive prayer.
[212.18 → 213.36] Praying for who are sick
[213.36 → 214.38] and how to do it.
[215.50 → 217.80] Thirdly, when there's conflict and sin
[217.80 → 219.76] in the community, you confess that sin
[219.76 → 221.16] and you pray for one another.
[221.90 → 223.30] And the final dimension of prayer
[223.30 → 224.98] in verse 16 and 17
[224.98 → 227.48] is the effective prayer of the righteous.
[228.02 → 229.80] And I'm going to attempt to cover
[229.80 → 231.48] all of these wonderful topics
[231.48 → 233.62] in James 5 this morning.
[233.62 → 234.44] So here we go.
[235.84 → 237.90] The first thing James says in this passage,
[238.00 → 238.20] he says,
[238.28 → 239.22] is anyone in trouble?
[240.40 → 240.76] Pray.
[241.52 → 242.32] That's his instruction.
[243.48 → 245.62] James is assuming that the default response
[246.18 → 247.08] for Christians,
[247.66 → 249.16] when they get into difficult,
[249.32 → 250.80] trying, and troubling situations,
[251.20 → 253.26] is to go to their Heavenly Father in prayer.
[254.36 → 257.40] Not stoically power through the complexity
[257.40 → 258.92] and difficulty in their own strength.
[259.34 → 261.38] Not minimize the difficulty of life
[261.38 → 263.80] and sort of hide the reality of what's going on,
[264.38 → 265.56] but to talk to God.
[266.24 → 267.52] And bring to God
[267.52 → 269.64] the concerns and the pains of your life,
[269.98 → 271.38] trusting that He cares
[271.38 → 272.98] and that He's going to use
[272.98 → 273.98] those difficult circumstances
[273.98 → 275.16] for good in your life.
[276.42 → 277.72] Now it's worth asking,
[278.72 → 280.36] what's your default response
[280.36 → 281.84] when you get in trouble?
[282.66 → 284.16] Whether it's difficult circumstances,
[284.34 → 285.52] very challenging relationships,
[286.10 → 287.02] all sorts of adversity,
[287.20 → 289.06] what's your default response?
[289.06 → 292.64] Is it to complain to a loved one or spouse?
[293.20 → 295.62] Is it to sort of grumble about the difficulty?
[295.86 → 296.72] Is it to get angry
[296.72 → 298.08] or take to social media
[298.08 → 299.58] and spout about how you feel?
[299.80 → 300.58] Or do you pray?
[301.82 → 302.82] Because James is saying,
[303.12 → 304.26] you've got a Heavenly Father
[304.26 → 305.80] who's right there,
[306.02 → 308.78] who knows, understands, and loves you,
[309.14 → 310.28] and He's the person
[310.28 → 312.08] who will not just walk through it with you,
[312.14 → 313.76] but form you in the likeness of Jesus
[313.76 → 315.46] through your difficulty.
[316.20 → 316.90] So pray.
[318.30 → 319.26] That's the first teaching.
[320.18 → 321.46] Now the second part of this
[321.46 → 322.84] is praying for the sick.
[322.98 → 324.66] And I could preach a whole sermon
[324.66 → 325.20] just on this,
[325.24 → 326.16] so I'm going to do my best
[326.16 → 327.56] to keep us in a good time here.
[327.64 → 329.10] But this is what we read in verse 14.
[329.60 → 331.52] Is anyone among you sick?
[332.22 → 333.68] Let them call the elders of the church
[333.68 → 334.48] to pray over them
[334.48 → 335.68] and anoint them with oil
[335.68 → 336.80] in the name of the Lord.
[337.32 → 338.98] And the prayer offered in faith
[338.98 → 339.96] will make them well.
[340.56 → 342.72] The Lord will raise them up.
[342.72 → 345.34] What a passage.
[346.40 → 347.58] And I'm sure it percolates
[347.58 → 348.66] in your head probably,
[348.82 → 349.54] some of the same questions
[349.54 → 350.52] that are percolating in my head.
[350.72 → 351.84] One of the questions I've had
[351.84 → 352.52] more than once,
[352.56 → 353.96] and I'm actually going to finally address it
[353.96 → 354.46] in my sermon,
[354.60 → 356.50] is what's with the essential oils
[356.50 → 357.60] showing up at the prayer meeting?
[358.26 → 358.48] Right?
[359.32 → 360.94] There is oil involved in prayer.
[361.02 → 361.66] And some of you are like,
[362.16 → 362.66] why?
[363.34 → 364.78] And so we're going to touch on that,
[364.78 → 365.24] and then we're going to get
[365.24 → 366.14] to some of the bigger questions.
[366.44 → 368.12] The essential oils in the prayer meeting,
[368.42 → 369.46] there are a few different reasons
[369.46 → 370.08] that people give,
[370.16 → 370.68] and I don't even know
[370.68 → 371.38] which one's the right one,
[371.38 → 372.28] so I'm going to give you the options
[372.28 → 372.82] on the table.
[373.34 → 374.02] One is,
[374.30 → 375.28] the oil represents
[375.28 → 376.30] the presence of God.
[377.40 → 378.66] When people are anointed with oil,
[378.76 → 379.66] they have a place on their head
[379.66 → 381.08] or the place of injury,
[381.46 → 382.70] it represents the spirit,
[382.82 → 384.06] it represents God's presence
[384.06 → 384.90] with that person
[384.90 → 385.60] and in their prayer.
[385.92 → 386.60] That's one take.
[386.94 → 388.48] Another take is far more pragmatic,
[388.96 → 390.52] and that is that the oil used in prayers
[390.52 → 391.44] is often olive oil,
[391.50 → 392.72] which is a medicinal oil,
[393.06 → 393.68] and oftentimes,
[393.68 → 394.78] when people were sick,
[394.86 → 396.10] you'd put oil on the wound,
[396.20 → 397.06] on the sick place.
[397.22 → 398.10] Like, if you know the story
[398.10 → 398.86] of the Good Samaritan,
[399.50 → 400.58] the Samaritan who helped
[400.58 → 401.18] the man who was sick,
[401.24 → 403.16] he put oil on the wounds,
[403.22 → 403.90] and so there's a sense
[403.90 → 405.92] in which it's a good medicinal practice,
[406.24 → 407.60] it contributes toward healing,
[407.72 → 408.42] and what's interesting
[408.42 → 409.82] is that people would say,
[409.92 → 410.12] you know,
[410.20 → 411.90] when people prayed for the sick
[411.90 → 413.34] and they put oil on their wounds,
[413.38 → 413.96] it's not like there's
[413.96 → 414.90] two different things going on.
[414.92 → 415.72] It's recognizing that God
[415.72 → 417.26] can work through medicine,
[417.96 → 419.00] and he does work through medicine,
[419.22 → 420.04] and our prayers
[420.04 → 421.92] are also something God works through,
[421.92 → 423.36] and they're not in conflict
[423.36 → 424.00] with one another.
[424.40 → 425.74] We do good medicine practice,
[425.74 → 427.12] and we pray for healing.
[428.88 → 429.94] But now we get to sort of
[429.94 → 430.58] the bigger question,
[430.70 → 432.48] and that is healing prayer.
[433.18 → 434.16] If you didn't grow up in the church,
[434.22 → 434.54] you're like,
[434.62 → 435.50] what is this?
[435.68 → 436.56] And maybe even if you did
[436.56 → 437.22] grow up in the church,
[437.28 → 437.58] you're like,
[437.78 → 438.68] what is this?
[439.02 → 440.06] And if you grow up in a church
[440.06 → 441.34] in a different part of the world,
[441.40 → 441.72] you're like,
[441.88 → 443.28] why isn't Hope doing this more,
[443.44 → 443.68] right?
[444.00 → 445.10] So there's a lot to say
[445.10 → 445.82] about healing prayer,
[445.88 → 447.60] and let me say the first thing.
[448.66 → 450.46] I want to let you know unequivocally
[450.46 → 451.46] that healing prayer
[451.46 → 452.38] has been taking place
[452.38 → 452.78] in the church
[452.78 → 453.58] from the beginning.
[454.68 → 455.80] Jesus practiced it.
[456.16 → 457.32] He invited his disciples
[457.32 → 458.28] to practice it,
[458.54 → 459.38] and they did it.
[460.02 → 460.34] In fact,
[460.38 → 461.34] let me just read for you
[461.34 → 463.20] words from Mark 6, 12, and 13.
[463.34 → 464.82] This also incorporates the oil.
[465.80 → 466.18] We read,
[466.24 → 466.74] they went out,
[466.78 → 467.26] and they preached
[467.26 → 468.30] that people should repent.
[468.78 → 469.98] They drove out many demons
[469.98 → 471.58] and anointed many sick people
[471.58 → 473.34] with oil and healed them.
[474.34 → 474.58] In fact,
[474.60 → 476.28] if you read 1 Corinthians 9,
[477.04 → 477.94] where Paul talks about
[477.94 → 478.80] the spiritual gifts,
[479.04 → 480.24] he lists all these things
[480.24 → 481.24] that the Spirit is giving
[481.24 → 481.86] to the church
[481.86 → 482.86] for ministry,
[483.48 → 484.42] the gift of intercession,
[484.60 → 485.76] the gift of hospitality,
[485.90 → 486.56] the gift of care,
[486.70 → 487.38] words of knowledge,
[487.50 → 487.72] tongues,
[487.86 → 489.62] and healing.
[490.44 → 491.46] And that gift is given
[491.46 → 492.14] so that the church
[492.14 → 493.54] can do ministry.
[493.72 → 494.58] And let me just say again,
[494.66 → 495.12] unequivocally,
[495.24 → 496.20] that the church's ministry
[496.20 → 497.50] throughout church history
[497.50 → 498.12] and around the world
[498.12 → 498.92] has included
[498.92 → 500.10] praying for healing
[500.10 → 501.78] and witnessing it.
[502.72 → 502.96] In fact,
[502.98 → 504.32] if you read about
[504.32 → 504.66] the church
[504.66 → 505.04] in the first,
[505.14 → 505.28] second,
[505.36 → 505.80] and third century,
[506.02 → 507.06] people often came to church
[507.06 → 507.92] because they knew
[507.92 → 508.52] that's the place
[508.52 → 509.28] they could get prayed for
[509.28 → 509.86] if they were sick.
[510.54 → 511.04] That's the place
[511.04 → 511.58] they knew they could
[511.58 → 512.02] get prayed for
[512.02 → 512.56] even if they didn't
[512.56 → 513.26] believe in Jesus.
[513.50 → 514.70] It was like the last-ditch effort
[514.70 → 516.14] to go and receive prayer.
[517.30 → 517.90] If you've ever been
[517.90 → 518.90] to an old cathedral
[518.90 → 520.42] or some of the monasteries
[520.42 → 521.28] throughout Northern Europe,
[521.56 → 522.34] actually throughout Europe,
[522.74 → 523.40] you'll know that
[523.40 → 524.06] on the walls
[524.06 → 525.02] or sometimes there are bins
[525.02 → 525.88] when you walk in
[525.88 → 526.66] of crutches
[526.66 → 527.60] and wheelchairs.
[527.72 → 528.04] Have any of you
[528.04 → 528.58] seen this before?
[529.68 → 530.44] I'm seeing one person
[530.44 → 530.86] nod their head.
[530.92 → 531.06] Okay,
[531.08 → 531.42] you should visit
[531.42 → 531.96] more cathedrals.
[533.66 → 534.28] You'll see that
[534.28 → 534.68] there are crutches
[534.68 → 535.34] and there's wheelchairs
[535.34 → 536.40] and other things around
[536.40 → 537.04] because people would
[537.04 → 537.92] go into the monastery,
[538.10 → 538.84] go into the cathedral,
[538.84 → 539.66] and they'd receive prayer
[539.66 → 540.06] from the elders
[540.06 → 541.04] and they would be healed
[541.04 → 541.92] and they would leave
[541.92 → 542.68] the crutches there
[542.68 → 543.82] as a testimony
[543.82 → 545.20] of the healing power
[545.20 → 546.08] of Jesus Christ.
[547.18 → 549.62] And that is still available.
[551.38 → 552.38] I say that because
[552.38 → 552.94] in the West
[552.94 → 554.14] there is often a suspicion.
[554.68 → 554.90] In fact,
[554.98 → 556.42] I remember sharing years ago
[556.42 → 557.28] a story of healing
[557.28 → 558.70] that a pastor shared with me
[558.70 → 559.48] and someone after the service,
[559.56 → 560.18] only in Canada
[560.18 → 560.66] does this happen.
[560.74 → 561.76] Someone comes after the service
[561.76 → 561.92] like,
[562.30 → 563.80] are you sure that story happened?
[564.38 → 565.20] I don't believe it happened.
[565.28 → 565.48] I'm like,
[565.54 → 565.72] well,
[565.82 → 566.70] you can track down
[566.70 → 567.20] that pastor
[567.20 → 567.94] who shared the story,
[568.02 → 568.50] but I do.
[568.94 → 569.62] But that's the kind
[569.62 → 570.28] of posture we have
[570.28 → 571.10] and there's some good reason
[571.10 → 571.60] for it.
[571.92 → 572.10] I mean,
[572.14 → 572.80] if I want to be honest
[572.80 → 573.22] with you,
[573.50 → 574.34] I grew up suspicious
[574.34 → 575.12] of healing prayer
[575.12 → 576.52] because there was a church
[576.52 → 577.66] not far from where I grew up
[577.66 → 578.84] that had some weird stuff
[578.84 → 579.42] going on
[579.42 → 581.48] and prayed in strange ways
[581.48 → 582.40] and there was a bit of,
[582.68 → 583.04] I don't know,
[583.16 → 584.64] corruption around sort of
[584.64 → 586.06] the fame of a person
[586.06 → 587.34] who could do healing ministry.
[587.82 → 588.64] You know what I'm talking about?
[588.96 → 589.82] And so we get suspicious.
[590.94 → 591.30] But,
[592.04 → 592.70] we have people
[592.70 → 593.68] in our own congregation
[593.68 → 594.66] from Latin America
[594.66 → 595.28] and Asia
[595.28 → 595.90] and especially
[595.90 → 596.62] our African brothers
[596.62 → 596.98] and sisters
[596.98 → 597.64] who have come into
[597.64 → 598.42] Hope Community Church
[598.42 → 598.90] and said to me,
[599.12 → 599.32] hey,
[599.60 → 600.58] where's the prayer meeting?
[601.34 → 601.64] I'm like,
[601.68 → 602.48] that's a perfect question.
[603.02 → 603.48] And they'll say,
[603.68 → 604.46] why aren't we praying
[604.46 → 605.00] for the sick
[605.00 → 605.96] in our worship services?
[606.30 → 606.84] Joe was here
[606.84 → 607.50] in the 9 a.m.
[607.50 → 608.00] and he was the one
[608.00 → 608.80] who said that to me first.
[608.86 → 608.96] He's like,
[609.00 → 609.94] where's the healing prayer?
[610.38 → 610.74] And you know
[610.74 → 611.44] what came out of that?
[612.68 → 613.00] Dwell.
[613.88 → 614.38] And some of you
[614.38 → 615.18] were here two weeks ago.
[615.28 → 616.38] We had our prayer service upstairs
[616.38 → 617.30] and we invited people
[617.30 → 617.82] who were sick
[617.82 → 618.70] who were going through
[618.70 → 619.42] whatever they're going through
[619.42 → 620.04] to receive prayer.
[620.12 → 620.98] We laid hands on people
[620.98 → 621.80] and we prayed for them
[621.80 → 622.92] and it was beautiful
[622.92 → 624.42] and we're going to do it again
[624.42 → 627.00] because God works through prayer.
[627.82 → 629.56] God heals bodies through prayer.
[630.18 → 631.88] God heals relationships
[631.88 → 632.84] through prayer.
[633.56 → 635.68] There is power in prayer.
[638.26 → 639.98] I'm guessing, though,
[640.62 → 641.50] that there are people
[641.50 → 642.20] in our church
[642.20 → 643.02] even this morning
[643.02 → 644.32] and your question is this.
[644.70 → 645.52] Tell me if I'm wrong.
[646.04 → 647.00] You're thinking to yourself,
[647.16 → 647.34] well,
[647.98 → 648.44] Pastor Dave,
[648.44 → 650.30] I prayed for my marriage
[650.30 → 650.88] to be healed
[650.88 → 652.46] and my spouse left me.
[653.54 → 655.12] I prayed for my mom's cancer
[655.12 → 655.80] to go away
[655.80 → 656.88] and she passed away.
[657.54 → 658.84] We prayed for this baby
[658.84 → 659.76] to come to full term
[659.76 → 660.50] and it didn't.
[661.04 → 661.70] Does that mean
[661.70 → 662.78] I don't have enough faith?
[663.90 → 664.70] You ever had that question?
[665.88 → 667.28] I've asked that question personally.
[667.58 → 667.74] You know,
[667.82 → 668.86] if I could name the thing
[668.86 → 669.42] that I prayed for
[669.42 → 670.30] most of my life,
[670.36 → 671.04] it's my brother's
[671.04 → 671.92] bipolar depression.
[672.88 → 674.56] We had a pretty crazy go
[674.56 → 675.24] with his depression
[675.24 → 675.96] for many years
[675.96 → 676.92] and I remember his family,
[677.08 → 677.80] his extended family,
[677.88 → 678.30] his friends,
[678.44 → 680.40] we prayed for Rob's bipolar
[680.40 → 682.10] and Rob still has bipolar
[682.10 → 684.14] and that's one of those things
[684.14 → 684.46] where I say,
[684.54 → 684.94] okay, Lord,
[685.78 → 686.64] we trust you.
[686.90 → 687.88] We'd love to see the healing
[687.88 → 689.22] but it hasn't happened
[689.22 → 691.08] and then that deep-seated question,
[691.20 → 691.30] well,
[691.38 → 692.10] is there something wrong
[692.10 → 692.78] with my faith?
[692.90 → 693.76] And I want to just say
[693.76 → 694.48] pastorally,
[694.72 → 695.54] I don't have time
[695.54 → 696.46] to go into all the details
[696.46 → 697.02] of this question
[697.02 → 698.14] but I want to say pastorally,
[698.60 → 700.16] I would not want you
[700.16 → 701.12] to go to the place of
[701.12 → 702.28] my faith is busted
[702.28 → 703.46] because this prayer
[703.46 → 704.04] wasn't answered.
[704.12 → 704.48] Number one,
[704.58 → 705.24] God answers prayers
[705.24 → 706.42] in a whole variety of ways
[706.42 → 707.80] over a long period of time
[707.80 → 708.64] in his judgment
[708.64 → 709.28] and sometimes
[709.28 → 710.24] a prayer is answered
[710.24 → 710.94] by a good friend,
[711.66 → 712.52] a good doctor,
[713.08 → 713.44] etc.
[714.10 → 714.70] But secondly,
[715.18 → 716.14] I think when things
[716.14 → 717.18] don't go the way we want,
[717.50 → 718.44] it doesn't necessarily mean
[718.44 → 719.18] our faith is broken.
[719.54 → 720.58] Let me give you one story.
[721.54 → 722.84] Jesus in Mark chapter 9,
[723.34 → 724.30] a man comes to Jesus
[724.30 → 725.54] with a boy of his
[725.54 → 726.18] that is sick.
[726.24 → 726.84] He's got a demon
[726.84 → 727.84] that's wrecking his life
[727.84 → 728.82] and he comes to Jesus
[728.82 → 729.68] with a sense of hope
[729.68 → 730.32] and possibility
[730.32 → 731.20] that Jesus could heal him.
[731.50 → 732.58] They have this big conversation
[732.58 → 733.60] about faith and unbelief
[733.60 → 735.16] and as the dad
[735.16 → 736.58] is sitting with his son
[736.58 → 737.64] and Jesus is there,
[737.98 → 738.70] he says to Jesus,
[738.78 → 739.36] I love this line,
[739.42 → 739.54] he says,
[739.62 → 740.66] Lord, I believe.
[741.38 → 742.16] You know what he says next?
[743.46 → 745.70] Help me in my unbelief.
[746.78 → 747.74] And guess what Jesus does?
[748.58 → 749.66] He heals the boy.
[750.46 → 751.48] And the point of that story
[751.48 → 752.82] is the generosity of Jesus
[752.82 → 754.22] and that that guy
[754.22 → 755.40] had enough faith.
[755.50 → 756.44] He didn't have a perfect faith.
[756.52 → 757.42] He had his doubts clearly.
[757.52 → 758.10] He even named them
[758.10 → 758.68] right in front of Jesus
[758.68 → 759.70] and that was enough.
[760.58 → 761.76] And the big picture thing
[761.76 → 762.62] I want us to recognize
[762.62 → 764.38] is that there are healings.
[764.92 → 765.78] The power of Christ
[765.78 → 766.34] that came,
[766.84 → 767.98] the resurrection power of Christ
[767.98 → 769.14] that's available by the Spirit
[769.14 → 769.76] is still here.
[769.86 → 770.56] Healing happens
[770.56 → 771.82] and we have testimonies
[771.82 → 772.94] in our own church of that
[772.94 → 774.24] but there are many times
[774.24 → 775.30] where we don't know how
[775.30 → 776.50] or when
[776.50 → 778.46] or why it didn't
[778.46 → 780.42] and we trust our sovereign God
[780.42 → 780.84] with that.
[781.88 → 783.34] We trust that he cares,
[783.60 → 784.36] that he knows
[784.36 → 786.88] and that Jesus,
[787.18 → 787.98] our suffering servant,
[788.10 → 789.20] is with us in it.
[789.78 → 791.54] If we've been hearing James so far,
[791.54 → 792.24] he's emphasized
[792.24 → 793.50] that Christ is present
[793.50 → 794.20] in our suffering
[794.20 → 796.38] and maybe this is worth saying,
[796.60 → 798.22] even Jesus had unanswered prayer.
[798.44 → 798.86] Do you know that?
[799.82 → 801.32] Jesus had unanswered prayer.
[801.66 → 802.28] In Gethsemane,
[802.40 → 803.74] right before his crucifixion,
[804.02 → 805.00] he prays to the Father,
[805.38 → 806.72] Father, if it is your will,
[806.84 → 808.44] take this cup of judgment from me.
[809.66 → 810.56] He didn't get that.
[811.50 → 813.46] He got the cross for us
[813.46 → 814.54] and it's Jesus,
[814.80 → 815.60] our suffering servant,
[815.80 → 816.66] who is with us
[816.66 → 817.56] in the trouble,
[817.70 → 818.32] in the suffering,
[818.44 → 819.32] in the sickness,
[820.14 → 820.98] ministering to us
[820.98 → 821.86] the will of the Father
[821.86 → 823.20] and we trust
[823.20 → 824.58] that the Father's will is good.
[825.72 → 826.52] Or to put it differently,
[826.66 → 827.10] to summarize,
[828.00 → 828.84] there are healings.
[829.18 → 830.14] God works miraculously
[830.14 → 830.76] through prayer.
[831.22 → 832.12] He works profoundly
[832.12 → 833.34] through ordinary medicine
[833.34 → 834.62] and that is no less a gift.
[834.74 → 835.26] Let me emphasize.
[836.00 → 836.50] There are times
[836.50 → 837.14] where we don't know
[837.14 → 837.88] what God is doing
[837.88 → 839.34] and we trust that even then
[839.34 → 840.26] Jesus is present
[840.26 → 842.34] and as we preached on last week,
[842.74 → 843.56] there will come a day
[843.56 → 845.02] where our suffering servant
[845.02 → 846.12] will do away with suffering
[846.12 → 847.72] altogether on his return.
[849.74 → 850.44] You know, this week
[850.44 → 851.08] I read a story
[851.08 → 852.24] about a Christian doctor.
[853.02 → 853.66] I was very intrigued
[853.66 → 854.26] by this story
[854.26 → 856.40] because he often had pastors
[856.40 → 857.66] come into his room
[857.66 → 858.28] in the hospital
[858.28 → 859.24] to pray for patients
[859.24 → 860.42] who were dying or sick
[860.42 → 861.92] and he was delighted by it.
[861.94 → 862.70] He wanted that.
[862.82 → 863.66] He was encouraged
[863.66 → 865.04] to work with a good pastor
[865.04 → 865.66] and have them pray.
[866.06 → 866.98] But he said there were times
[866.98 → 868.32] where pastors came in
[868.32 → 869.72] with too much confidence
[869.72 → 871.40] and he said,
[871.78 → 873.34] they promised to the patient
[873.34 → 874.84] more than they could deliver.
[876.00 → 876.66] And sometimes,
[876.86 → 877.46] in his opinion,
[877.60 → 878.28] they left patients
[878.28 → 879.58] with a wavering faith
[879.58 → 881.16] because something didn't happen
[881.16 → 881.68] that the pastor
[881.68 → 882.36] may have promised
[882.36 → 883.26] would happen.
[884.44 → 885.52] And in his own reflection
[885.52 → 886.14] as a physician
[886.14 → 886.94] who loved the Lord,
[887.02 → 887.94] he said sometimes,
[888.38 → 889.74] and he's talking about pastors now,
[890.26 → 891.70] pastors needed to learn
[891.70 → 892.32] and teach
[892.32 → 893.12] what he calls
[893.12 → 894.74] the sacrament of suffering.
[896.10 → 896.94] And when he says that,
[897.00 → 897.90] he means that Christ
[897.90 → 898.74] is equally present
[898.74 → 899.40] in the suffering,
[899.40 → 900.52] even when we don't get
[900.52 → 900.96] the answer
[900.96 → 902.30] that we were looking for.
[903.00 → 904.06] And I think that's true.
[908.90 → 909.72] Big picture.
[910.06 → 910.60] I think it's helpful
[910.60 → 911.60] to avoid two extremes
[911.60 → 912.64] when it comes to healing prayer.
[912.76 → 913.24] Number one,
[913.90 → 915.22] to resist this doubt
[915.22 → 915.88] and the suspicion
[915.88 → 916.82] in the Western church
[916.82 → 917.76] that it doesn't happen.
[918.66 → 919.56] And to trust
[919.56 → 920.70] that there are many times
[920.70 → 921.98] where God acts miraculously
[921.98 → 922.78] and powerfully
[922.78 → 923.44] through our prayers.
[923.62 → 924.12] It's real.
[924.48 → 925.30] The power is available.
[925.42 → 926.22] That's what James is saying.
[926.42 → 927.42] But the other extreme is
[927.42 → 928.64] it will always happen
[928.64 → 929.32] and if it doesn't,
[929.32 → 930.18] your faith is broken.
[930.88 → 932.18] Between those two extremes,
[932.30 → 934.28] we see James 5 teaching us.
[935.82 → 937.22] Now we get to the third teaching
[937.22 → 939.42] on prayer in James 5
[939.42 → 940.72] and it is about confession.
[941.12 → 941.78] This is what we read
[941.78 → 942.54] in verse 14.
[942.54 → 943.86] Therefore,
[944.10 → 945.74] confess your sins to each other
[945.74 → 947.02] and pray for each other
[947.02 → 948.84] so that you may be healed.
[950.08 → 951.14] Two important things there.
[951.22 → 951.66] Number one,
[951.98 → 953.46] invitation to confessing sin
[953.46 → 954.08] to other believers.
[954.48 → 954.82] Secondly,
[954.92 → 955.88] the result of healing.
[956.56 → 957.90] And let me maybe state
[957.90 → 958.46] very clearly,
[958.60 → 959.08] this is not just
[959.08 → 960.14] an invitation to confession.
[960.68 → 961.28] This is actually,
[961.44 → 961.78] in the Greek,
[961.88 → 962.50] it's a command.
[962.66 → 963.20] James is saying,
[963.64 → 964.46] confess your sins.
[965.14 → 965.64] Do it.
[965.72 → 967.08] This is not an optional practice
[967.08 → 967.62] in the church.
[967.98 → 969.22] This is something that happens
[969.22 → 970.34] because we are believers.
[971.36 → 972.38] Back up a little bit.
[972.58 → 973.64] If you think of all the things
[973.64 → 974.72] that James talked about
[974.72 → 975.42] in this book,
[975.50 → 976.28] it's really important to know
[976.28 → 977.16] how confession fits
[977.16 → 977.80] into all of it.
[978.22 → 979.12] He's named division
[979.12 → 980.20] between people in the church,
[980.34 → 980.76] factions,
[981.36 → 982.94] grumbling about all the circumstances
[982.94 → 983.48] going on,
[983.52 → 984.36] and also favouritism
[984.36 → 985.04] towards the wealthy,
[985.24 → 985.98] neglect of the poor.
[986.08 → 987.26] James has named a lot of sin
[987.26 → 987.70] in the church.
[988.00 → 989.14] And the antidote,
[989.60 → 990.20] don't miss this,
[990.20 → 991.10] the antidote
[991.10 → 991.90] to what's going on
[991.90 → 993.12] is confession.
[994.48 → 995.46] That's how the believers
[995.46 → 996.38] don't avoid it,
[996.44 → 997.12] don't run away from it,
[997.16 → 997.66] don't neglect it.
[997.70 → 999.24] They go through the conflict
[999.24 → 1000.04] into reconciliation,
[1000.38 → 1000.66] grace,
[1001.22 → 1001.74] and mercy.
[1003.24 → 1005.14] Confession is a powerful thing.
[1006.10 → 1007.18] And maybe even as I mention
[1007.18 → 1007.58] that word,
[1007.64 → 1008.84] it brings a memory for you
[1008.84 → 1010.10] of that thing
[1010.10 → 1010.78] you had to name
[1010.78 → 1011.54] with that other person,
[1011.60 → 1011.94] that friend,
[1012.04 → 1012.58] that family member,
[1012.66 → 1013.34] that spouse
[1013.34 → 1015.18] who you wronged
[1015.18 → 1016.36] and you named it.
[1016.84 → 1018.72] And it opens a powerful door
[1018.72 → 1019.58] for reconciliation.
[1020.20 → 1021.78] You know,
[1021.82 → 1022.48] a couple of years ago,
[1022.56 → 1023.40] I was in Brazil
[1023.40 → 1024.36] on my study leave
[1024.36 → 1025.28] and I had the privilege
[1025.28 → 1025.78] of learning
[1025.78 → 1027.22] with a number of Brazilian pastors
[1027.22 → 1028.14] and church planters.
[1028.92 → 1029.54] And at the end of the week,
[1029.60 → 1030.36] they have this practice
[1030.36 → 1031.60] which is just so moving.
[1031.82 → 1032.78] They do communion together
[1032.78 → 1034.68] and it takes like an hour.
[1034.96 → 1035.70] They're in no rush.
[1036.32 → 1037.24] And they all get
[1037.24 → 1038.20] a big chunk of bread,
[1038.30 → 1039.44] they all get a big cup of wine,
[1039.52 → 1040.62] and they pair off
[1040.62 → 1041.60] around the room
[1041.60 → 1043.48] and they confess their sins,
[1044.16 → 1045.10] speak words of grace
[1045.10 → 1045.68] over each other,
[1045.72 → 1046.84] and then they eat bread together.
[1046.96 → 1048.16] It's the most beautiful thing.
[1048.20 → 1048.46] And again,
[1048.52 → 1049.46] I don't understand Portuguese,
[1049.46 → 1050.60] but I know enough
[1050.60 → 1051.74] to know that the Spirit of God
[1051.74 → 1053.18] was palpably present
[1053.18 → 1054.28] in grace and mercy
[1054.28 → 1054.90] in that room
[1054.90 → 1056.38] as pastors are sharing
[1056.38 → 1056.94] their hearts,
[1057.24 → 1057.86] being vulnerable
[1057.86 → 1058.66] about their weaknesses,
[1058.90 → 1059.44] their shortcomings,
[1059.54 → 1060.10] and their failures,
[1060.30 → 1061.68] and then having another pastor say,
[1061.98 → 1063.50] the grace of Jesus is yours.
[1064.26 → 1065.90] The mercy of Christ is yours.
[1066.18 → 1066.94] Take this bread,
[1067.24 → 1067.94] drink this cup,
[1068.32 → 1070.14] receive the mercy of Jesus.
[1071.50 → 1072.54] Just imagine,
[1073.28 → 1074.82] just imagine what could be possible
[1074.82 → 1075.38] in the church
[1075.38 → 1076.80] if that kind of confession
[1076.80 → 1077.66] was normal,
[1078.46 → 1080.18] if that was the humble,
[1080.58 → 1081.16] transparent,
[1081.76 → 1082.60] vulnerable posture
[1082.60 → 1084.46] that we had towards one another
[1084.46 → 1085.16] in our sin,
[1085.70 → 1086.52] in our shortcoming,
[1086.70 → 1087.28] in our weakness.
[1087.28 → 1090.06] my spiritual director
[1090.06 → 1090.66] has said to me
[1090.66 → 1091.52] several times,
[1092.04 → 1092.72] you don't need to confess
[1092.72 → 1093.94] your sin to everybody,
[1094.20 → 1095.98] but you do need to confess
[1095.98 → 1096.96] your sin to somebody.
[1097.44 → 1098.66] So pick a trusted friend.
[1099.22 → 1100.38] Have that person share
[1100.38 → 1101.38] and speak words of grace
[1101.38 → 1102.00] over you
[1102.00 → 1103.10] such that we learn
[1103.10 → 1104.18] to be the church
[1104.18 → 1105.50] which names sin
[1105.50 → 1106.66] and experiences,
[1106.86 → 1107.70] don't miss the promise,
[1108.10 → 1108.98] the healing
[1108.98 → 1110.28] that comes from it.
[1111.36 → 1112.18] And when James talks
[1112.18 → 1112.58] about healing,
[1112.66 → 1113.68] it's not just physical healing,
[1113.74 → 1114.32] it's relational,
[1114.66 → 1115.16] it's emotional,
[1115.36 → 1115.94] it's psychological,
[1115.94 → 1116.86] it's spiritual.
[1117.80 → 1118.34] And for a church
[1118.34 → 1119.50] that practices confession,
[1119.64 → 1120.38] that names honestly
[1120.38 → 1120.98] what's going on
[1120.98 → 1121.40] in our faith
[1121.40 → 1121.88] with one another,
[1122.02 → 1124.10] we experience healing.
[1125.30 → 1125.80] And man,
[1125.86 → 1126.52] do I want our church
[1126.52 → 1127.36] to experience that.
[1129.68 → 1130.52] Now we get
[1130.52 → 1131.76] to the final teaching
[1131.76 → 1132.74] on prayer.
[1133.84 → 1134.72] Very intriguing
[1134.72 → 1135.70] little verse,
[1135.88 → 1136.50] verse 16,
[1136.62 → 1138.24] the prayer of a righteous person
[1138.24 → 1138.90] is powerful
[1138.90 → 1140.24] and effective.
[1141.90 → 1142.26] You know,
[1142.28 → 1143.38] whenever I read that line,
[1143.46 → 1144.02] powerful and effective,
[1144.10 → 1145.00] I always think of Bonnie Henry
[1145.00 → 1145.60] because that's how she
[1145.60 → 1146.76] described the vaccine.
[1147.42 → 1148.12] But James says,
[1148.22 → 1149.74] the prayer of a righteous person
[1149.74 → 1151.40] is powerful and effective.
[1152.06 → 1153.04] That's not a statement
[1153.04 → 1153.70] about the efficacy
[1153.70 → 1154.28] of the vaccine,
[1154.34 → 1154.70] by the way.
[1154.86 → 1156.02] Do not hold that against me.
[1156.74 → 1157.24] James says,
[1157.32 → 1158.90] the prayer of a righteous person
[1158.90 → 1159.82] is powerful and effective.
[1160.46 → 1161.26] And in our family,
[1161.36 → 1161.98] we always say that
[1161.98 → 1162.70] about my mother-in-law,
[1162.82 → 1163.04] Marnie.
[1163.10 → 1163.78] If you know Marnie,
[1163.88 → 1165.18] she is a prayer warrior.
[1165.84 → 1167.34] She is a gifted intercessor.
[1167.54 → 1168.58] And whenever we really want
[1168.58 → 1169.24] something to happen,
[1169.30 → 1170.66] we want God to hear our prayers,
[1170.74 → 1171.06] we're like,
[1171.36 → 1171.70] Marnie,
[1171.94 → 1173.34] you have to start praying for this.
[1173.60 → 1174.70] We've got to make this happen.
[1174.70 → 1175.98] And she has experienced
[1175.98 → 1177.18] a lot of answered prayer.
[1177.62 → 1177.90] In fact,
[1177.94 → 1179.02] her whole life is a testimony
[1179.02 → 1180.42] to the power of prayer.
[1181.52 → 1183.38] And the reason James says that
[1183.38 → 1184.68] is because it's true.
[1185.24 → 1186.36] And when he says the word righteous,
[1186.52 → 1188.10] you should hear right related.
[1188.20 → 1189.12] That's such a helpful frame.
[1189.18 → 1190.30] When you hear a righteous person,
[1190.38 → 1192.20] they are in right relationship
[1192.20 → 1192.86] with the Father.
[1193.52 → 1194.54] They are communicating,
[1194.72 → 1195.66] they're close to his heart,
[1195.72 → 1197.04] they're living obediently
[1197.04 → 1198.02] according to his word,
[1198.02 → 1199.86] and they experience the richness
[1199.86 → 1200.58] of that closeness,
[1200.70 → 1201.56] which is in part,
[1202.16 → 1202.78] answered prayer.
[1203.70 → 1205.06] And the example James gives
[1205.06 → 1206.30] is Elijah, right?
[1206.78 → 1208.14] Elijah prays that it doesn't rain
[1208.14 → 1208.86] and it doesn't rain.
[1208.92 → 1210.24] He prays again that it does rain
[1210.24 → 1210.92] and it does rain.
[1211.00 → 1212.16] And we need some more Elijah's
[1212.16 → 1212.84] in British Columbia.
[1213.02 → 1213.70] Tell me I'm wrong.
[1215.16 → 1216.68] Righteousness is what Elijah demonstrated.
[1216.80 → 1218.14] He was close to the heart of the Father.
[1219.18 → 1221.14] He understood the will of the Father.
[1221.14 → 1223.24] And he prayed into that will
[1223.24 → 1225.82] such that he experienced answered prayer.
[1227.28 → 1229.08] One commentator on this passage
[1229.08 → 1230.30] made an intriguing statement.
[1230.42 → 1231.26] He said there are two pieces
[1231.26 → 1232.48] of this part of this teaching
[1232.48 → 1233.18] that we need to understand.
[1233.28 → 1233.78] Number one,
[1234.32 → 1235.12] there is an encouragement.
[1235.76 → 1236.88] An encouragement to be close
[1236.88 → 1237.72] to the heart of God,
[1237.86 → 1238.74] living a righteous life
[1238.74 → 1239.98] that leads to a sense
[1239.98 → 1240.84] of God's presence
[1240.84 → 1242.84] and his power in and through our prayers.
[1243.08 → 1244.12] That's a huge encouragement.
[1244.42 → 1245.48] The other side is
[1245.48 → 1246.56] a bit of a warning.
[1247.32 → 1248.54] A warning that there's a way
[1248.54 → 1249.20] in which you can live
[1249.20 → 1250.38] at a distance from God
[1250.38 → 1251.94] and in disobedience to God
[1251.94 → 1253.96] in a way that blocks prayer.
[1255.12 → 1256.56] And that is a reality in the church
[1256.56 → 1257.36] that we need to name.
[1259.18 → 1259.94] Richard Foster,
[1260.16 → 1261.10] an author I love
[1261.10 → 1262.08] and commend to everybody,
[1262.56 → 1263.46] he's written extensively
[1263.46 → 1264.54] about spiritual practices
[1264.54 → 1265.22] and prayer.
[1265.34 → 1266.92] And in one of his works on prayer,
[1267.02 → 1267.92] this is what he writes
[1267.92 → 1269.20] about himself, really.
[1269.88 → 1270.30] He writes,
[1270.40 → 1272.18] I cannot make the flow
[1272.18 → 1273.76] of heavenly life happen.
[1273.96 → 1275.08] A very important recognition.
[1275.92 → 1277.44] But I can stop it.
[1278.30 → 1280.00] If I resist or refuse
[1280.00 → 1281.20] to be an open conduit
[1281.20 → 1282.04] for God's power
[1282.04 → 1283.58] to come into a person,
[1284.22 → 1286.32] it will stop.
[1287.62 → 1288.72] Again, that recognition
[1288.72 → 1290.08] that as we are
[1290.08 → 1290.88] in right relationship
[1290.88 → 1291.76] and obedient relationship
[1291.76 → 1292.22] with the Father,
[1292.30 → 1292.92] we can experience
[1292.92 → 1293.56] his closeness
[1293.56 → 1294.44] and the richness
[1294.44 → 1295.24] of answered prayer.
[1295.56 → 1296.68] And at the same time,
[1296.74 → 1297.48] we can resist,
[1297.70 → 1298.28] live at a distance
[1298.28 → 1298.92] in disobedience
[1298.92 → 1300.54] and block the movement
[1300.54 → 1301.46] of the Spirit
[1301.46 → 1302.60] in our lives.
[1304.20 → 1305.48] So in a sentence,
[1305.82 → 1306.58] if I were to summarize
[1306.58 → 1307.30] James 5,
[1308.02 → 1308.72] it would be,
[1309.22 → 1309.84] are you in trouble?
[1310.82 → 1311.14] Pray.
[1311.62 → 1313.14] Is someone in your church sick?
[1314.00 → 1314.32] Pray.
[1314.90 → 1316.26] Is there issues of sin
[1316.26 → 1317.08] that needs to be confessed
[1317.08 → 1317.74] in your church?
[1318.42 → 1318.82] Pray.
[1318.98 → 1322.24] Because prayer is powerful.
[1323.50 → 1324.52] That's James 5.
[1324.52 → 1326.90] And the big question
[1326.90 → 1327.74] it leaves me with
[1327.74 → 1328.68] for us this morning
[1328.68 → 1329.18] is this.
[1329.26 → 1330.38] If prayer is such a gift,
[1331.16 → 1332.24] if God gives us
[1332.24 → 1333.30] the language of prayer
[1333.30 → 1334.12] to be in relationship
[1334.12 → 1334.54] with him,
[1334.74 → 1336.08] and if he can heal people
[1336.08 → 1336.50] through it
[1336.50 → 1337.62] and transform our hearts
[1337.62 → 1337.98] through it
[1337.98 → 1339.24] and communicate his will
[1339.24 → 1339.68] through it,
[1340.32 → 1341.50] why aren't we praying?
[1342.98 → 1343.82] Are you feeling that?
[1344.86 → 1346.54] Like what is so important
[1346.54 → 1347.62] in our lives
[1347.62 → 1348.78] that we don't make
[1348.78 → 1349.74] any time for prayer?
[1350.70 → 1351.94] What is so pressing
[1351.94 → 1352.74] in your agenda
[1352.74 → 1355.08] that you can't find time
[1355.08 → 1356.64] to speak with
[1356.64 → 1357.68] and converse with
[1357.68 → 1358.86] and listen to
[1358.86 → 1360.26] our Heavenly Father?
[1362.34 → 1363.58] I want us to take
[1363.58 → 1364.14] that question
[1364.14 → 1365.54] into our dinner tables
[1365.54 → 1367.14] in our small groups
[1367.14 → 1369.18] and wrestle with it.
[1370.14 → 1372.10] There is a long-standing critique
[1372.10 → 1373.42] that Christians
[1373.42 → 1374.40] from all over the world
[1374.40 → 1375.82] have of the Western church
[1375.82 → 1376.54] and it's this.
[1377.02 → 1378.04] You have so much activity
[1378.04 → 1378.64] in your church,
[1378.78 → 1379.84] so many opportunities,
[1380.00 → 1381.72] so many good ministries
[1381.72 → 1382.18] happening,
[1382.18 → 1383.44] so much busyness,
[1383.52 → 1384.80] but where is your prayer?
[1386.14 → 1387.42] Where are your prayer meetings?
[1387.98 → 1388.92] Why are you not praying
[1388.92 → 1389.42] for the sick?
[1389.54 → 1390.10] Why aren't people
[1390.10 → 1391.04] gathering together
[1391.04 → 1392.10] and expecting God
[1392.10 → 1393.06] to work as we pray?
[1393.36 → 1394.08] And I've had that
[1394.08 → 1394.92] asked me personally
[1394.92 → 1395.94] and it's convicting.
[1397.16 → 1398.00] It's convicting.
[1398.74 → 1400.48] And I have a pastoral burden
[1400.48 → 1401.28] for our church
[1401.28 → 1401.98] and a concern,
[1402.08 → 1403.58] and this is for all of us,
[1403.66 → 1404.48] present company included,
[1404.68 → 1405.42] that we could go
[1405.42 → 1406.66] through our whole lives
[1406.66 → 1408.18] and never experience
[1408.18 → 1408.90] the power of prayer.
[1408.90 → 1408.94] prayer.
[1409.70 → 1410.54] And that's a tragedy.
[1411.36 → 1412.66] That's a real tragedy.
[1413.62 → 1414.42] And I don't think
[1414.42 → 1415.02] there's going to be people
[1415.02 → 1415.96] on their deathbeds
[1415.96 → 1417.60] who have regret
[1417.60 → 1419.00] about praying a lot.
[1420.00 → 1420.76] I think there's going to be
[1420.76 → 1421.58] people on their deathbeds
[1421.58 → 1421.78] who say,
[1421.88 → 1422.08] man,
[1422.24 → 1423.90] I can't believe I binged
[1423.90 → 1424.76] that much Netflix
[1424.76 → 1426.18] and neglected
[1426.18 → 1426.86] the things that matter.
[1426.92 → 1427.38] I can't believe
[1427.38 → 1428.46] I wasted so much time
[1428.46 → 1429.10] on social media
[1429.10 → 1430.10] firing off another text
[1430.10 → 1431.46] and I never learned
[1431.46 → 1432.16] to pray.
[1432.16 → 1434.22] And I don't want people
[1434.22 → 1434.66] in our church
[1434.66 → 1435.36] on their deathbeds
[1435.36 → 1436.28] finally praying
[1436.28 → 1437.24] for the first time.
[1437.94 → 1438.66] I want people
[1438.66 → 1439.22] in this church
[1439.22 → 1440.90] to be rich in prayer,
[1442.20 → 1443.50] experiencing the closeness
[1443.50 → 1444.62] of the presence
[1444.62 → 1445.28] of the Father
[1445.28 → 1446.70] and the power
[1446.70 → 1447.90] that comes through the Son
[1447.90 → 1448.60] in the Spirit
[1448.60 → 1449.34] in our lives
[1449.34 → 1450.46] and in our church.
[1451.58 → 1453.20] That is my deepest desire
[1453.20 → 1453.98] for us.
[1455.86 → 1456.40] You know,
[1456.44 → 1457.60] just a personal note.
[1458.22 → 1459.34] On Wednesday this week
[1459.34 → 1460.54] we had our staff meeting
[1460.54 → 1463.04] and we made goals
[1463.04 → 1463.54] in January
[1463.54 → 1464.58] and I decided
[1464.58 → 1465.08] that this would be
[1465.08 → 1465.90] the week when we follow up
[1465.90 → 1466.76] on the goals that we made
[1466.76 → 1467.24] and it's good
[1467.24 → 1468.08] to be held accountable
[1468.08 → 1468.86] to what you say
[1468.86 → 1469.52] was your goal
[1469.52 → 1470.80] in January 2022
[1470.80 → 1471.62] which by the way
[1471.62 → 1472.58] is hard to do in church
[1472.58 → 1473.86] post-COVID, etc.
[1474.70 → 1475.30] But anyway,
[1475.40 → 1475.84] one of the goals
[1475.84 → 1476.72] that I had written down
[1476.72 → 1477.98] and had to be accountable to
[1477.98 → 1479.34] is that I wrote in January
[1479.34 → 1481.52] that my goal for 2022,
[1481.80 → 1482.62] one of them was
[1482.62 → 1485.20] cultivate a culture of prayer
[1485.20 → 1486.50] at Hope Community Church.
[1487.44 → 1488.62] And if I'm honest with you,
[1488.68 → 1489.70] I haven't done much on it.
[1490.50 → 1491.74] There's been pretty cool things
[1491.74 → 1492.16] that have happened
[1492.16 → 1493.24] in our church in prayer.
[1494.00 → 1494.80] Great gatherings
[1494.80 → 1495.34] that have happened
[1495.34 → 1496.06] but none of those
[1496.06 → 1496.72] are because of me.
[1497.64 → 1498.56] But I want you to know
[1498.56 → 1499.82] that it is a deep desire
[1499.82 → 1500.94] of my heart as a pastor
[1500.94 → 1503.80] that we form in us
[1503.80 → 1505.00] a culture of prayer.
[1505.78 → 1507.78] That we experience together
[1507.78 → 1508.44] what it means
[1508.44 → 1509.70] to come down on our knees
[1509.70 → 1511.20] and ask that kingdom come,
[1511.68 → 1512.58] that will be done
[1512.58 → 1513.40] in our lives,
[1513.50 → 1514.00] in our city,
[1514.14 → 1514.72] in our families,
[1514.84 → 1515.40] in our marriages
[1515.40 → 1517.10] as it is in heaven above.
[1517.10 → 1519.54] And I have this sort of
[1519.54 → 1520.78] ominous story of Jesus
[1520.78 → 1522.60] in the back of my mind
[1522.60 → 1523.42] as I think about prayer.
[1523.78 → 1524.28] And it's a story
[1524.28 → 1525.50] of Jesus getting mad
[1525.50 → 1527.02] as he goes into the temple.
[1527.12 → 1528.02] Some of you know this story.
[1528.54 → 1529.12] Jesus is mad
[1529.12 → 1529.78] because there's a lot
[1529.78 → 1530.52] of busyness happening.
[1530.62 → 1531.28] They're selling animals,
[1531.36 → 1532.10] there's so much activity
[1532.10 → 1533.38] and he starts flipping tables
[1533.38 → 1534.44] and driving people out
[1534.44 → 1535.56] and this main point
[1535.56 → 1536.94] after he gets mad is,
[1537.40 → 1538.66] my house shall be a what?
[1539.84 → 1540.76] A house of prayer.
[1540.76 → 1542.86] And I wonder,
[1543.00 → 1543.88] how many churches
[1543.88 → 1544.86] can it be said about
[1544.86 → 1545.60] in the West
[1545.60 → 1546.72] that this is a house
[1546.72 → 1548.22] of prayer?
[1549.08 → 1550.12] That when people think,
[1550.24 → 1551.34] ah, Hope Community Church,
[1551.52 → 1552.42] that's a place
[1552.42 → 1554.64] where I can receive prayer.
[1555.28 → 1555.98] That's a place
[1555.98 → 1556.72] where I can grow
[1556.72 → 1557.68] in my conversation
[1557.68 → 1559.10] with the living God
[1559.10 → 1560.76] and experience answered prayer.
[1562.94 → 1564.64] My heart for our church
[1564.64 → 1565.44] as we listen
[1565.44 → 1566.64] to a passage like this
[1566.64 → 1568.08] is that we discover
[1568.08 → 1570.02] the power of prayer.
[1570.76 → 1574.00] Now it just so happens
[1574.00 → 1575.28] that next week
[1575.28 → 1577.24] you can try it out.
[1578.12 → 1579.26] Pacific Community Church,
[1579.38 → 1580.36] one of our sister churches
[1580.36 → 1580.94] in Coverdale,
[1581.12 → 1581.94] a church that we have
[1581.94 → 1582.98] a great deal of love for
[1582.98 → 1583.94] and we collaborate with
[1583.94 → 1585.30] at the Coverdale Community Kitchen,
[1585.92 → 1586.72] they're doing another
[1586.72 → 1588.22] 24-7 prayer.
[1588.46 → 1589.72] You know what 24-7 prayer is?
[1590.24 → 1591.08] That is basically
[1591.08 → 1592.28] where people can sign up
[1592.28 → 1593.32] and go for an hour of prayer
[1593.32 → 1594.88] any time of the day or night.
[1594.96 → 1596.02] It's 24 hours a day
[1596.02 → 1596.66] for a whole week.
[1597.00 → 1598.40] You sign up for a one-hour block
[1598.40 → 1598.88] and you pray.
[1599.56 → 1600.70] So if you're a night hawk,
[1600.76 → 1602.62] you can sign up for 2 a.m.
[1602.98 → 1603.48] and pray.
[1604.52 → 1605.42] And that also brings
[1605.42 → 1606.22] a horrible story
[1606.22 → 1607.52] of one time my wife and I,
[1607.86 → 1608.56] when we were younger,
[1608.70 → 1609.84] we did a 24-7 prayer
[1609.84 → 1610.38] and we went
[1610.38 → 1611.02] and she prayed
[1611.02 → 1611.70] and I fell asleep.
[1612.20 → 1612.90] But the chain of prayer
[1612.90 → 1613.44] was not broken
[1613.44 → 1614.38] because my wife prayed.
[1615.08 → 1615.72] But I will tell you,
[1615.76 → 1616.18] I've done a number
[1616.18 → 1617.06] of 24–7 prayers
[1617.06 → 1618.16] and just being in the room,
[1618.22 → 1618.68] by the way,
[1618.80 → 1619.76] is so beautiful
[1619.76 → 1620.44] because there's something
[1620.44 → 1621.24] about being in a room
[1621.24 → 1621.82] where people are praying
[1621.82 → 1622.50] constantly
[1622.50 → 1623.96] that pulls you into prayer.
[1624.04 → 1625.20] The Spirit is present
[1625.20 → 1626.14] as you join the prayer.
[1626.14 → 1627.22] And you'll find,
[1627.74 → 1628.92] as one of our elders did,
[1629.02 → 1629.76] he and I actually went
[1629.76 → 1630.94] back to back last year,
[1631.44 → 1633.26] that that hour goes like this.
[1634.20 → 1635.30] You put your phone down,
[1635.58 → 1636.36] you get on your knees,
[1636.46 → 1637.46] you see all these prayer requests
[1637.46 → 1638.14] written on the walls,
[1638.30 → 1639.28] and you engage
[1639.28 → 1640.14] in conversation
[1640.14 → 1642.20] with the living God
[1642.20 → 1644.02] about the needs of a world
[1644.02 → 1645.30] He loves,
[1645.64 → 1647.02] about the life that you live
[1647.02 → 1648.08] that He loves.
[1648.14 → 1649.12] And you invite Him
[1649.12 → 1650.04] to act.
[1650.04 → 1651.66] and like a good Father,
[1651.84 → 1655.18] He loves answering prayer.
[1658.84 → 1659.88] Let me finish
[1659.88 → 1661.30] by praying for us.
[1661.38 → 1661.78] Let's pray.
[1670.12 → 1671.74] Father, I ask that You make us
[1671.74 → 1672.80] a house of prayer.
[1674.88 → 1676.66] And I ask that You teach us
[1676.66 → 1677.86] how to pray.
[1680.04 → 1681.04] And perhaps it's fitting
[1681.04 → 1682.78] that I actually first confess
[1682.78 → 1683.72] on our behalf
[1683.72 → 1685.40] our prayerlessness.
[1687.22 → 1688.74] I pray that You would uproot
[1688.74 → 1689.52] in our hearts
[1689.52 → 1690.46] and our lives
[1690.46 → 1691.82] self-sufficiency.
[1693.40 → 1695.06] I pray that You would plant
[1695.06 → 1696.62] in us a deep desire
[1696.62 → 1697.80] to depend on You.
[1698.96 → 1700.32] And I ask that with whatever
[1700.32 → 1700.96] we're going through,
[1701.04 → 1701.76] whatever the hurts
[1701.76 → 1702.38] and the pains,
[1702.50 → 1703.48] the joys and the sorrows,
[1703.56 → 1704.98] that You would meet us
[1704.98 → 1705.62] in prayer.
[1707.00 → 1708.32] Lord, if there are burdens,
[1708.44 → 1709.24] even in this room,
[1709.24 → 1710.22] deep burdens,
[1710.94 → 1711.82] we ask that You would
[1711.82 → 1712.96] answer prayer this week,
[1713.64 → 1714.48] that You would move
[1714.48 → 1715.12] through our prayers
[1715.12 → 1715.74] this week,
[1716.08 → 1717.32] and You would remind us
[1717.32 → 1718.08] in ways we need
[1718.08 → 1718.72] to be reminded
[1718.72 → 1719.78] that You work
[1719.78 → 1721.06] through prayer.
[1722.08 → 1722.98] So fill us
[1722.98 → 1723.68] with Your Spirit,
[1724.74 → 1725.66] walk with us
[1725.66 → 1726.34] in our hurt,
[1726.96 → 1728.08] and teach us to pray.
[1729.10 → 1729.40] Amen.
[1731.78 → 1733.12] Our song of response
[1733.12 → 1733.92] is called
[1733.92 → 1735.02] Make Us a House of Prayer.
[1735.16 → 1735.90] If you've been to Dwell,
[1736.02 → 1736.96] you will have sung it before.
[1737.04 → 1737.80] It might be brand new.
[1737.80 → 1738.84] We'll sing it a couple of times
[1738.84 → 1739.14] through,
[1739.54 → 1740.78] but I couldn't finish
[1740.78 → 1741.94] this sermon on this passage
[1741.94 → 1742.78] without singing
[1742.78 → 1744.22] Make Us a House of Prayer.
[1744.32 → 1744.96] So let's stand
[1744.96 → 1745.64] and sing together
[1745.64 → 1746.78] Make Us a House of Prayer.
