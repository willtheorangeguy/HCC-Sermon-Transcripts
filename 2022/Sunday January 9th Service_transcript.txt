[0.00 --> 3.20]  Just a note about the budget.
[3.96 --> 5.72]  Linda Wing, who's our bookkeeper at the church,
[5.80 --> 8.46]  she said to me on Friday that we at least met
[8.46 --> 10.38]  and probably exceeded our budget by quite a bit.
[10.46 --> 12.76]  I just want to give thanks to the Lord for the generosity of this church.
[17.02 --> 20.70]  And, I mean, that's also in light of the fact that I think,
[21.00 --> 24.46]  according to Linda, we gave over $100,000 to all sorts of causes in our city,
[24.46 --> 26.32]  which is just an incredible amount of money.
[27.18 --> 28.72]  And, yeah, on Friday I just kind of looked at her and I'm like,
[28.72 --> 29.90]  wow, God is so good, you know.
[29.96 --> 31.44]  For a lot of us, I know it's been a hard season,
[31.60 --> 34.58]  and yet generosity has been there, and we're so grateful.
[35.06 --> 37.34]  And it's just one sign of a way that people are saying,
[37.42 --> 39.30]  I don't want to just be part of this church in my presence,
[39.42 --> 42.32]  but I want to give to the causes of this church to bless the city.
[42.44 --> 43.54]  So that's good news.
[46.58 --> 47.88]  I'm being asked to move this way.
[49.00 --> 52.58]  Oh, you want me lining up perfectly with that light above my head, John.
[53.12 --> 54.36]  It's this angelic halo.
[54.62 --> 55.36]  This is kind of weird.
[56.32 --> 57.70]  Any other things I need to do?
[58.72 --> 61.24]  Well, we're going to start a new sermon series on the Gospel of John.
[61.54 --> 62.52]  And I'm very excited.
[62.60 --> 63.82]  I've never preached through this whole book,
[63.88 --> 65.54]  and it's going to take us right into Easter.
[66.44 --> 68.14]  The Gospel of John, you should know,
[68.48 --> 71.34]  is often the first book of the Bible that people read.
[72.14 --> 75.08]  It's the book that people who are sort of struggling to figure out what Christianity is about,
[75.14 --> 76.04]  that's the first one they read.
[76.04 --> 80.28]  In fact, I read this week that when translators go to new places,
[80.38 --> 81.88]  new people groups that do not have the Bible,
[82.02 --> 84.82]  the first book they read is the Gospel of John.
[84.92 --> 85.42]  And a shout out.
[85.42 --> 86.78]  We've got some translators in the back,
[87.08 --> 90.58]  and I just want to say I'm so grateful that we have young people studying Bible translation
[90.58 --> 93.42]  so that people can read the Gospel of John in their own language.
[94.20 --> 98.58]  But yeah, there is countless stories of people reading through the Gospel of John
[98.58 --> 101.08]  and coming to Christ just from that book.
[101.48 --> 103.52]  And you're going to hear some of those over the next coming weeks, actually.
[103.74 --> 105.12]  But there's countless stories of people saying,
[105.24 --> 109.02]  if this is Christianity, if this is what Jesus is about, I'm in.
[109.02 --> 111.12]  So this is a powerful book.
[111.68 --> 114.70]  And I want you to know that we have a tradition that hope,
[114.76 --> 116.48]  whenever we start a new sermon series, we want to say to you,
[116.70 --> 118.14]  read this book.
[118.22 --> 118.86]  And we're going to do that.
[118.90 --> 121.02]  And actually, I have some, I'm going to invite Misha up.
[121.02 --> 121.46]  Where is Misha?
[121.56 --> 121.84]  There she is.
[121.86 --> 123.16]  She's going to say, she's our youth pastor.
[123.24 --> 124.40]  She's going to say a few books about how,
[124.64 --> 127.14]  a few words about how we're going to interact with this book as we read through it.
[127.48 --> 128.08]  You can use that mic.
[133.02 --> 133.60]  Good morning.
[133.92 --> 134.70]  It's good to be here.
[134.70 --> 137.72]  So, some people have already been asking,
[138.00 --> 140.20]  what are these little bags that we see in the front?
[140.36 --> 143.22]  And you were probably told they're not for you because you're old.
[143.80 --> 145.62]  Well, you're not wrong.
[146.02 --> 148.30]  But, so to help more of our youth,
[149.00 --> 150.78]  I've created these little bags for the youth.
[150.92 --> 154.36]  And inside is a little card that has a reading plan
[154.36 --> 156.94]  to help you keep track of which passage,
[157.10 --> 158.34]  which chapter to read each week,
[158.56 --> 162.14]  so that you know what is going to be spoken about the coming Sunday.
[162.64 --> 164.36]  So, this week is week two,
[164.36 --> 165.88]  so you're a little behind already,
[166.08 --> 169.00]  but you can catch up because chapter one is pretty short.
[169.36 --> 170.80]  But also, there's extra cards.
[170.96 --> 172.66]  Once all the youth get their bag,
[172.96 --> 175.10]  you're free, the rest of the congregation,
[175.26 --> 176.36]  to grab a bag as well.
[176.64 --> 177.88]  There's a few little treats inside.
[178.26 --> 179.92]  There's sticky notes, though, inside.
[180.30 --> 181.08]  And the point is,
[181.14 --> 183.16]  we want youth and all of us as a church
[183.16 --> 184.98]  to be asking questions as we read.
[185.04 --> 186.50]  We don't want to just read it to read it.
[186.76 --> 188.66]  We want to read it to actually think,
[188.74 --> 190.24]  like, what does this mean for us?
[190.24 --> 191.86]  And maybe some of it is confusing
[191.86 --> 193.80]  or hard to understand, complicated.
[194.04 --> 196.80]  So, we get to ask all of our hard questions to Dave,
[196.80 --> 199.10]  and he is going to answer them all
[199.10 --> 200.86]  because he has all of the answers I hear.
[201.24 --> 204.50]  So, every Sunday, we're going to have a little box,
[204.60 --> 205.54]  probably out in the foyer,
[205.72 --> 207.98]  that you can drop your sticky note question in.
[207.98 --> 210.92]  Or, on the back of the card, if you take one,
[211.22 --> 213.16]  there is a QR code that you can scan,
[213.26 --> 214.98]  and you can enter your question online.
[215.32 --> 216.74]  And that will also go to Dave
[216.74 --> 218.70]  to get to answer all of your questions.
[219.68 --> 221.08]  And, yeah, that's all.
[222.36 --> 224.04]  I'd like to make a clarification on that.
[224.12 --> 225.54]  I'm not going to answer all the questions.
[226.74 --> 228.56]  But we do want you to ask questions.
[228.82 --> 230.34]  And, you know, especially our younger,
[230.60 --> 231.44]  we have a number of students
[231.44 --> 232.64]  who just graduated Cornerstone
[232.64 --> 234.42]  and are joining us in this building
[234.42 --> 235.68]  for Sunday sermons.
[235.84 --> 236.82]  And we want to give you an opportunity
[236.82 --> 237.50]  to ask questions.
[237.64 --> 239.16]  And, you know, we're going to bring some of them up.
[239.20 --> 240.72]  If you have it, I'll bring it up on a Sunday morning.
[240.78 --> 241.42]  We'll talk about it.
[241.44 --> 242.64]  And we want to interact with the Bible.
[242.64 --> 243.60]  And we recognize that there's,
[243.96 --> 244.88]  you know, this is an old book.
[245.32 --> 246.14]  This is an old document.
[246.30 --> 247.62]  And we need to do some work sometimes,
[247.70 --> 249.38]  some heavy lifting to make sense of it for today.
[249.74 --> 251.14]  And I think sometimes the best thing
[251.14 --> 252.42]  that we can do is ask a good question.
[252.92 --> 253.98]  And I won't know the answers,
[254.10 --> 256.14]  but I actually know a local pastor
[256.14 --> 257.48]  who did his PhD on John.
[257.58 --> 258.92]  I have a father-in-law who's got his PhD.
[259.44 --> 260.16]  And we've got a few,
[260.28 --> 261.44]  we've got a regent prof in our church.
[261.50 --> 262.40]  So, if I don't know the answer,
[262.42 --> 263.16]  I'm just going to go to them.
[263.22 --> 264.32]  And I'm going to bring them up on the stage
[264.32 --> 265.18]  and they'll talk about it.
[265.30 --> 266.28]  And it will be great.
[267.74 --> 268.06]  Okay.
[269.28 --> 271.30]  I'm going to do a bit of an introduction overview
[271.30 --> 272.96]  of the Gospel of John this morning.
[273.34 --> 275.58]  And I am in a bit of a preacher's nightmare.
[275.84 --> 276.92]  I'm not going to tell you what time it is,
[277.02 --> 279.00]  but we're on South American time today.
[279.60 --> 281.56]  And I invite you to turn with me
[281.56 --> 284.80]  to John 1 and also to John 20.
[286.02 --> 287.34]  I'm going to read these through together.
[288.62 --> 289.54]  One of the main questions
[289.54 --> 290.56]  we're going to be asking this morning
[290.56 --> 292.66]  is why in the world did John even write this Gospel?
[292.66 --> 294.30]  I mean, they were already in circulation,
[294.48 --> 295.34]  Matthew, Mark, and Luke.
[295.54 --> 297.92]  What compelled John to write this additional,
[298.02 --> 299.34]  you might say, Gospel account?
[300.90 --> 302.26]  This is John 1.
[302.26 --> 305.74]  In the beginning was the Word.
[306.14 --> 307.86]  The Word was with God,
[308.00 --> 309.48]  and the Word was God.
[310.20 --> 311.38]  He was with God in the beginning.
[312.20 --> 313.38]  Through Him all things were made,
[313.44 --> 316.10]  and without Him nothing was made that has been made.
[316.90 --> 318.08]  In Him was life,
[318.64 --> 320.40]  and that life was the light of all people.
[321.26 --> 322.68]  The light shines in the darkness,
[322.80 --> 325.18]  and the darkness has not overcome it.
[325.84 --> 328.10]  There was a man sent from God whose name was John.
[328.10 --> 330.98]  He came as a witness to testify concerning that light
[330.98 --> 332.80]  so that through Him all might believe.
[333.64 --> 334.86]  He Himself was not the light.
[335.24 --> 337.48]  He came only as a witness to the light.
[338.22 --> 339.94]  The true light that gives light to everyone
[339.94 --> 341.12]  was coming into the world.
[341.74 --> 342.48]  He was in the world,
[342.60 --> 343.98]  and though the world was made through Him,
[344.04 --> 345.50]  the world did not recognize Him.
[346.32 --> 347.88]  He came to that which was His own,
[348.04 --> 349.48]  but His own did not receive Him.
[350.18 --> 351.60]  Yet to all who did receive Him,
[351.74 --> 353.42]  to those who believed in His name,
[353.48 --> 356.06]  He gave the right to become children of God,
[356.06 --> 358.06]  children not born of natural descent
[358.06 --> 360.00]  nor of human decision or husband's will,
[360.22 --> 361.82]  but born of God.
[362.52 --> 364.12]  The Word became flesh
[364.12 --> 366.08]  and made His dwelling among us.
[366.44 --> 367.70]  We've seen His glory,
[367.92 --> 369.80]  the glory of the one and only Son
[369.80 --> 370.86]  who came from the Father,
[371.02 --> 372.44]  full of grace and truth.
[373.66 --> 375.06]  John testified concerning Him.
[375.16 --> 376.02]  He cried out, saying,
[376.28 --> 377.54]  This is the one of whom I said,
[377.62 --> 380.48]  He who comes after me has surpassed me
[380.48 --> 381.86]  because He was before me.
[382.76 --> 384.94]  Out of His fullness we have received grace.
[384.94 --> 386.76]  in place of grace already given.
[387.36 --> 388.74]  For the law was given through Moses,
[389.26 --> 391.38]  grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
[392.18 --> 393.74]  No one has ever seen God,
[394.08 --> 395.60]  but the one and only Son,
[396.02 --> 397.52]  who Himself is God
[397.52 --> 400.12]  and is in closest relationship with the Father,
[400.56 --> 402.12]  has made Him known.
[403.26 --> 405.02]  And now over to John chapter 20.
[405.02 --> 414.40]  Jesus performed many other signs
[414.40 --> 415.64]  in the presence of His disciples,
[416.08 --> 417.90]  which are not recorded in this book,
[418.50 --> 419.48]  but these are written
[419.48 --> 421.22]  that you may believe
[421.22 --> 423.38]  that Jesus is the Messiah,
[423.84 --> 424.82]  the Son of God,
[424.88 --> 425.90]  and that by believing,
[426.40 --> 429.02]  you may have life in His name.
[429.02 --> 434.84]  Well, a number of years ago,
[434.88 --> 437.54]  Brittany and I went to the Celebration of Light Festival
[437.54 --> 438.38]  at English Bay.
[438.48 --> 439.78]  Has anyone ever been to that, by the way,
[440.26 --> 441.00]  with the different countries?
[441.58 --> 442.76]  They go and they compete
[442.76 --> 444.96]  and they do these incredible light displays
[444.96 --> 446.70]  and they choreograph it to music.
[447.48 --> 448.34]  We went one year,
[448.50 --> 449.74]  and I'd never gone to one here,
[449.78 --> 451.24]  but I've been to a number of light festivals.
[451.66 --> 453.14]  I do happen to love fireworks.
[453.64 --> 455.08]  Who can't like fireworks?
[455.74 --> 457.04]  And usually they start like this.
[457.04 --> 458.58]  You start with like a nice firework
[458.58 --> 459.50]  that gets everyone's attention,
[459.60 --> 461.08]  then you start throwing more into the sky,
[461.24 --> 463.12]  and you know, they save the best for last.
[463.20 --> 464.26]  As the time goes on,
[464.30 --> 465.76]  usually 25, 30 minutes by the end,
[465.80 --> 467.48]  they're just throwing all the fireworks in the sky.
[467.60 --> 469.28]  There's tons of booms, color everywhere.
[469.64 --> 470.30]  It's phenomenal.
[471.34 --> 472.48]  The one that we went to,
[472.54 --> 474.18]  which I believe was done by Italy,
[474.60 --> 476.58]  started in a very different fashion.
[476.86 --> 478.10]  I remember us sitting there on the grass
[478.10 --> 479.90]  and blankets waiting for it to get dark enough,
[480.02 --> 480.90]  and all of a sudden,
[481.00 --> 483.16]  there was just a huge boom.
[483.88 --> 484.96]  All the children who were there
[484.96 --> 485.90]  started crying together.
[485.90 --> 487.64]  But within a few seconds,
[488.06 --> 489.32]  light went everywhere.
[489.48 --> 490.36]  Like all the color,
[490.54 --> 491.28]  all the sound,
[491.46 --> 492.82]  all the different kinds of fireworks
[492.82 --> 494.58]  were just exploding in the sky.
[494.66 --> 496.30]  It just lit everything up,
[496.36 --> 497.14]  and it was phenomenal.
[497.48 --> 499.04]  It's like they took the grand finale
[499.04 --> 500.14]  that was meant for the end,
[500.46 --> 501.90]  and they put it right at the front.
[503.44 --> 504.58]  Now, if I had to pick an image
[504.58 --> 506.24]  for how John starts his gospel,
[507.06 --> 507.94]  that's the one.
[508.40 --> 510.12]  Taking the grand finale from the end
[510.12 --> 511.90]  and putting it right at the front.
[513.14 --> 514.32]  John's gospel is unique.
[514.32 --> 515.88]  We're going to talk about that this morning.
[516.02 --> 517.08]  It's different from the others.
[517.24 --> 519.68]  Matthew starts his gospel with a genealogy.
[520.26 --> 520.70]  Riveting.
[521.62 --> 522.82]  Luke starts his gospel
[522.82 --> 524.56]  by talking about the cultural context
[524.56 --> 525.90]  that Jesus was born into.
[526.50 --> 528.44]  John, this is just my imagination,
[528.90 --> 529.70]  he looks at those,
[529.78 --> 530.12]  he's like,
[530.30 --> 531.62]  we're going to get things going.
[531.70 --> 533.20]  He starts lighting off the fireworks.
[534.58 --> 536.06]  In the beginning was the Word,
[536.18 --> 537.90]  and the Word was with God.
[538.14 --> 538.54]  Boom!
[538.74 --> 540.30]  When the Word was God,
[540.54 --> 540.90]  boom!
[540.90 --> 542.42]  He was with God in the beginning.
[542.78 --> 543.14]  Boom!
[543.30 --> 545.12]  Through all things that were created,
[545.34 --> 547.52]  were created through him and by him.
[548.42 --> 549.64]  We've seen his glory.
[549.82 --> 551.18]  The Word was made flesh
[551.18 --> 552.66]  and made his dwelling among us.
[552.98 --> 553.34]  Boom!
[554.08 --> 555.42]  Grace and truth.
[555.94 --> 556.40]  Boom!
[557.28 --> 559.18]  John wants everyone who reads his gospel
[559.18 --> 560.46]  right at the front
[560.46 --> 563.16]  to recognize that this Jesus character,
[563.64 --> 564.86]  who he is introducing,
[565.44 --> 566.90]  they see his glory.
[567.54 --> 569.18]  They see this is not just a biography,
[569.18 --> 570.98]  this is not just some interesting information
[570.98 --> 572.52]  about a man who lived in the first century,
[572.78 --> 574.18]  this is Jesus Christ,
[574.82 --> 576.34]  the firstborn over creation,
[576.64 --> 578.16]  the one who is there from the beginning,
[578.28 --> 579.66]  the one who brings grace and truth,
[579.88 --> 582.66]  the one who fully reveals the will of the Father.
[583.42 --> 584.64]  Welcome to Jesus,
[584.94 --> 586.50]  says John in John 1.
[587.80 --> 589.32]  And a great little exercise,
[589.76 --> 591.68]  if you want to do at home or with kids,
[592.06 --> 593.46]  is just read this passage
[593.46 --> 596.14]  and write down bullet points
[596.14 --> 597.24]  of what John is saying
[597.24 --> 598.78]  about the identity of Jesus,
[598.88 --> 600.20]  about who Jesus is.
[600.28 --> 602.50]  I mean, if you're a first-time reader of the Bible
[602.50 --> 603.52]  and you read John 1,
[603.80 --> 605.60]  you've got lots of questions.
[605.70 --> 607.96]  Like, what is John saying about this person
[607.96 --> 609.40]  born in Bethlehem
[609.40 --> 612.02]  and his relationship to the whole world
[612.02 --> 613.18]  and the Father?
[615.78 --> 617.78]  Now, I want to give us just a brief overview
[617.78 --> 619.06]  of the structure of John.
[619.18 --> 621.04]  I know some of us don't care too much about this,
[621.12 --> 622.22]  but I think it's helpful to know
[622.22 --> 623.06]  as you read through the gospel
[623.06 --> 623.74]  how it's structured.
[623.82 --> 624.90]  So I'm going to give you some bullet points,
[624.90 --> 626.86]  and I'm told by John I'm not allowed to move
[626.86 --> 628.10]  as I give these bullet points.
[628.16 --> 629.00]  So no moving, Dave.
[629.66 --> 632.38]  Part one is the opening introduction
[632.38 --> 634.34]  or what people call the prologue.
[634.40 --> 636.02]  And this is where John lights off all the fireworks.
[636.14 --> 637.46]  He's letting everyone know this is Jesus.
[637.70 --> 638.86]  Jesus is not just another human.
[638.94 --> 639.72]  He's the Son of God,
[639.80 --> 640.54]  full of grace and truth.
[640.62 --> 641.50]  The Word became flesh,
[641.84 --> 642.72]  moved into the neighborhood.
[643.56 --> 646.98]  Part two is Jesus' three-year ministry on earth.
[647.04 --> 648.90]  So he just walks through what Jesus does,
[648.98 --> 649.50]  what he teaches,
[649.88 --> 651.14]  all his signs and wonders.
[651.28 --> 652.36]  John gives lots of stories,
[652.36 --> 653.22]  like the other gospels,
[653.30 --> 655.46]  about how Jesus performs many miracles.
[657.16 --> 660.04]  Part three is Jesus' last days.
[660.14 --> 661.98]  And this is chapters 13 through 20.
[662.06 --> 662.72]  And it's very interesting.
[662.86 --> 664.28]  John actually stretches out
[664.28 --> 665.72]  and slows the narrative down
[665.72 --> 667.20]  as he gets to Jesus, you know,
[667.26 --> 668.94]  being with his disciples in the upper room,
[669.46 --> 670.80]  talking to them about where he's going,
[670.98 --> 671.98]  promising the Holy Spirit,
[672.18 --> 673.00]  washing their feet.
[673.32 --> 674.12]  Then he's betrayed,
[674.38 --> 675.12]  then he's crucified,
[675.40 --> 676.18]  and then he's resurrected.
[676.34 --> 678.70]  But that's all chapter 13 through 20.
[679.64 --> 681.00]  Then the final chapter,
[681.00 --> 682.56]  it's almost like it begins with one chapter,
[682.68 --> 683.68]  it finishes with one chapter.
[683.78 --> 685.48]  The final chapter is John 21.
[686.16 --> 687.06]  And this is where Jesus,
[687.22 --> 688.46]  the resurrected Messiah,
[689.12 --> 690.52]  goes and meets his disciples.
[691.28 --> 692.88]  Disciples who abandoned him,
[693.26 --> 693.96]  denied him,
[694.34 --> 696.06]  fled when he was being interrogated
[696.06 --> 696.84]  and flogged.
[697.08 --> 698.04]  And he grabs them,
[698.10 --> 698.68]  he holds them,
[698.70 --> 699.16]  and he says,
[699.76 --> 700.84]  I forgive you,
[700.94 --> 702.36]  and I send you
[702.36 --> 704.20]  to make known the good news of Jesus.
[704.28 --> 705.84]  It's a commissioning of his disciples
[705.84 --> 706.38]  for mission,
[706.50 --> 707.30]  a mission that continues
[707.30 --> 708.64]  right into our present moment
[708.64 --> 709.82]  in our own city.
[709.82 --> 711.72]  It starts with opening up
[711.72 --> 712.36]  who is Jesus,
[712.82 --> 713.84]  the ministry of Jesus,
[714.18 --> 715.42]  the final days of Jesus,
[715.62 --> 716.64]  his death and resurrection,
[716.84 --> 718.74]  and then Jesus sending disciples out
[718.74 --> 719.92]  to make the gospel known.
[719.98 --> 722.04]  That is the structure of John.
[723.78 --> 724.68]  But as I noted,
[724.82 --> 726.62]  the gospel of John is very unique.
[726.74 --> 727.00]  In fact,
[727.12 --> 728.18]  a lot of books have been written
[728.18 --> 729.44]  about how John is not like
[729.44 --> 731.22]  Matthew, Mark, and Luke.
[731.68 --> 732.44]  Matthew, Mark, and Luke
[732.44 --> 733.64]  have a lot of similarities.
[733.78 --> 734.66]  There's a lot of overlap.
[734.88 --> 735.12]  In fact,
[735.16 --> 736.08]  there's a good comic
[736.08 --> 736.98]  I was going to show,
[737.06 --> 737.96]  but I don't have that much time.
[737.96 --> 739.60]  But it shows Matthew, Mark, Luke,
[739.64 --> 740.32]  and John as students
[740.32 --> 741.16]  sitting at desks.
[741.92 --> 742.84]  And Matthew, Mark, and Luke,
[742.92 --> 743.30]  they're writing,
[743.44 --> 743.94]  John's writing,
[744.02 --> 744.68]  and the teacher looks
[744.68 --> 745.28]  at all three of them
[745.28 --> 745.60]  and says,
[745.94 --> 746.86]  Matthew, Mark, Luke,
[746.90 --> 748.18]  I want you to see me after class.
[748.56 --> 749.96]  You're copying each other's work.
[750.78 --> 751.46]  And they are,
[751.50 --> 752.20]  on purpose.
[752.70 --> 753.64]  Because they want everyone
[753.64 --> 754.36]  to know these stories
[754.36 --> 754.96]  of what Jesus did.
[755.00 --> 755.88]  They want to communicate it
[755.88 --> 756.56]  to different audiences.
[756.74 --> 758.04]  But John is sort of over here
[758.04 --> 759.24]  doing his own thing,
[759.66 --> 761.06]  writing in very different ways,
[761.18 --> 762.32]  using very different categories,
[762.42 --> 763.68]  and using a lot of different stories.
[764.24 --> 765.10]  There are a lot of stories
[765.10 --> 766.30]  in Matthew, Mark, and Luke
[766.30 --> 767.72]  that are not in John.
[768.08 --> 768.94]  And there's a lot of stories
[768.94 --> 769.78]  in John that are not
[769.78 --> 770.98]  in Matthew, Mark, and Luke.
[771.02 --> 771.50]  And people are like,
[771.58 --> 772.22]  why is that?
[772.76 --> 773.72]  And there's a lot of reasons
[773.72 --> 774.14]  for that.
[774.26 --> 774.92]  One is that John
[774.92 --> 776.02]  wrote his gospel later,
[776.36 --> 777.40]  and he may have had access
[777.40 --> 778.40]  to Matthew, Mark, and Luke.
[778.44 --> 778.60]  He's like,
[778.64 --> 779.80]  oh, they forgot these stories.
[779.88 --> 780.60]  They've got to know.
[780.70 --> 781.38]  People need to know
[781.38 --> 781.94]  these stories.
[782.78 --> 783.66]  But John also,
[783.76 --> 784.22]  you should know
[784.22 --> 785.24]  at the outset of this series,
[785.74 --> 787.12]  he knew Jesus well.
[788.70 --> 789.72]  John the disciple,
[789.86 --> 791.24]  he was on the inner circle
[791.24 --> 791.76]  of Jesus.
[791.76 --> 793.02]  Like, he was a close
[793.02 --> 794.28]  friend of Jesus.
[794.88 --> 795.36]  And when you read
[795.36 --> 796.26]  this gospel account,
[796.68 --> 797.52]  you're reading an account
[797.52 --> 798.36]  of someone who knew
[798.36 --> 799.96]  Jesus intimately.
[800.86 --> 801.52]  He was there
[801.52 --> 802.12]  for the miracles.
[802.28 --> 802.78]  He was there
[802.78 --> 803.28]  for the teaching.
[803.38 --> 803.92]  He was there
[803.92 --> 804.64]  for the foot washing.
[804.74 --> 805.66]  And he wants us to know
[805.66 --> 806.58]  what it was like
[806.58 --> 807.72]  as an eyewitness
[807.72 --> 810.20]  to see and behold
[810.20 --> 811.98]  and watch what Jesus does
[811.98 --> 812.74]  for the world.
[813.36 --> 814.34]  So you're reading
[814.34 --> 815.12]  the witness of someone
[815.12 --> 815.92]  who's close to him.
[817.06 --> 817.90]  But more than that,
[817.94 --> 818.96]  what makes this gospel unique
[818.96 --> 819.64]  is that it's not only
[819.64 --> 820.28]  written later,
[820.60 --> 821.18]  but John's writing
[821.18 --> 822.20]  to a different audience.
[822.20 --> 823.04]  I mean, I mentioned
[823.04 --> 823.84]  that Matthew starts
[823.84 --> 824.70]  with a genealogy.
[825.36 --> 826.10]  And for most of us,
[826.14 --> 826.68]  I think we could say,
[826.76 --> 827.60]  yeah, that's pretty boring
[827.60 --> 828.06]  unless you're one
[828.06 --> 829.36]  of those ancestry people, right?
[830.10 --> 830.90]  Every family has
[830.90 --> 832.04]  one of those ancestry people.
[832.24 --> 833.18]  And you can thank them
[833.18 --> 834.10]  for the book about your family.
[834.18 --> 834.86]  You would never know
[834.86 --> 835.46]  if you didn't have
[835.46 --> 836.32]  that person in your family.
[837.46 --> 838.18]  But Matthew starts
[838.18 --> 838.86]  with a genealogy
[838.86 --> 840.52]  because it really matters
[840.52 --> 841.62]  to Jewish people.
[842.00 --> 842.74]  And they want to know,
[842.90 --> 843.92]  like, Jesus for them
[843.92 --> 845.12]  is like a major problem.
[845.22 --> 845.60]  It's like, okay,
[845.70 --> 846.76]  the Messiah who's going
[846.76 --> 847.58]  to bring the renewal
[847.58 --> 848.02]  of the world,
[848.08 --> 848.72]  he gets crucified?
[848.96 --> 849.88]  Yeah, no way.
[849.88 --> 851.40]  And so Matthew is saying,
[851.50 --> 851.82]  hey, look,
[851.90 --> 853.12]  he's part of the Old Testament story.
[853.50 --> 854.82]  He's part of David's line.
[855.20 --> 856.44]  This is your Messiah.
[856.56 --> 857.66]  He's writing to that group,
[857.94 --> 858.60]  convincing them,
[858.76 --> 859.34]  persuading them
[859.34 --> 860.22]  of who Jesus is.
[860.80 --> 861.50]  John's not writing
[861.50 --> 862.22]  to Jewish people.
[862.44 --> 863.48]  The gospel has gone out
[863.48 --> 864.08]  from Jerusalem.
[864.52 --> 865.38]  Most of the believers
[865.38 --> 866.08]  were not Jewish.
[866.24 --> 866.72]  They were Greeks
[866.72 --> 867.76]  living in various cities
[867.76 --> 868.28]  throughout Rome.
[868.50 --> 869.16]  And John says,
[869.32 --> 870.36]  I want to communicate
[870.36 --> 871.66]  the gospel to them.
[872.32 --> 873.92]  I want to use their language.
[874.04 --> 875.16]  I want to use their words.
[875.24 --> 876.74]  I want them to understand
[876.74 --> 878.36]  in their ordinary lives
[878.36 --> 879.48]  who Jesus is.
[879.88 --> 880.62]  That's why John
[880.62 --> 881.62]  doesn't use genealogies.
[881.70 --> 882.44]  He uses languages
[882.44 --> 884.24]  like light and darkness,
[884.74 --> 885.74]  life and death.
[885.80 --> 887.12]  He uses the word logos.
[887.66 --> 888.54]  If I had more time,
[888.62 --> 889.22]  I'd go into how
[889.22 --> 890.00]  in John 1,
[890.48 --> 891.38]  he uses one of the most
[891.38 --> 892.20]  popular words
[892.20 --> 892.94]  in Greek philosophy,
[893.02 --> 893.38]  the logos.
[893.94 --> 894.50]  That's their sort of
[894.50 --> 896.02]  understanding of what's out there.
[896.12 --> 897.26]  It represents the work
[897.26 --> 898.26]  of God outside.
[898.46 --> 899.08]  It's not close
[899.08 --> 899.94]  to the material world.
[900.28 --> 900.68]  And John's like,
[900.72 --> 901.14]  in the beginning
[901.14 --> 901.78]  was the logos.
[902.10 --> 902.68]  I'm like, ooh,
[903.28 --> 903.70]  the logos.
[903.96 --> 904.80]  We understand that.
[905.36 --> 906.70]  The logos was with God
[906.70 --> 907.88]  and then the logos
[907.88 --> 908.96]  was God.
[909.12 --> 909.52]  I'm like, okay,
[909.58 --> 910.30]  this is tracking.
[910.48 --> 911.22]  And then he says,
[911.82 --> 913.66]  the logos became flesh
[913.66 --> 915.46]  and made his dwelling
[915.46 --> 916.22]  among us.
[916.64 --> 917.76]  And that's where he's like,
[918.52 --> 919.34]  this is Jesus
[919.34 --> 920.68]  who became flesh.
[920.76 --> 921.64]  He came into our material
[921.64 --> 922.36]  world to save us.
[922.38 --> 923.32]  And he's pulling in
[923.32 --> 924.50]  a Greek audience.
[924.64 --> 925.78]  He's using different categories,
[926.14 --> 926.76]  different words
[926.76 --> 927.48]  to communicate
[927.48 --> 928.22]  the good news of Jesus
[928.22 --> 929.06]  to a different group
[929.06 --> 929.56]  of people.
[930.08 --> 930.88]  And it's very powerful
[930.88 --> 931.50]  to me,
[931.66 --> 932.06]  at least,
[932.52 --> 933.30]  to think that God
[933.30 --> 934.32]  compels Matthew
[934.32 --> 935.42]  to write a genealogy
[935.42 --> 936.44]  to help Jewish people
[936.44 --> 937.18]  understand the gospel.
[937.48 --> 938.82]  And he compels John
[938.82 --> 939.50]  by his spirit
[939.50 --> 940.22]  to communicate
[940.22 --> 940.92]  the good news of Jesus
[940.92 --> 941.70]  to Greek people
[941.70 --> 942.46]  because God wants
[942.46 --> 943.40]  all people
[943.40 --> 944.66]  to hear the good news
[944.66 --> 945.72]  in a way that makes sense
[945.72 --> 946.56]  to them.
[949.36 --> 950.34]  So it's a unique
[950.34 --> 951.50]  gospel account.
[952.64 --> 953.94]  But I want to hone in
[953.94 --> 956.24]  on the why
[956.24 --> 957.02]  of this gospel.
[957.68 --> 958.08]  Again,
[958.16 --> 958.70]  there's three other
[958.70 --> 959.46]  gospel accounts
[959.46 --> 960.30]  circulating.
[960.70 --> 961.36]  And they're good
[961.36 --> 962.04]  gospel accounts.
[962.04 --> 962.26]  I mean,
[962.30 --> 963.08]  I love Matthew,
[963.24 --> 963.42]  Mark,
[963.48 --> 963.84]  and Luke.
[964.30 --> 964.80]  But John,
[964.94 --> 966.02]  at an old age,
[966.06 --> 966.44]  they're guessing
[966.44 --> 967.30]  he's well into
[967.30 --> 968.10]  his old age
[968.10 --> 968.58]  at the time
[968.58 --> 969.12]  of this writing,
[969.20 --> 969.94]  he feels compelled
[969.94 --> 971.64]  to write this account.
[972.78 --> 973.70]  And we want to know,
[973.78 --> 974.28]  is it just because
[974.28 --> 975.20]  he wants a different audience?
[975.32 --> 976.00]  Is it just because
[976.00 --> 976.94]  he has something to say
[976.94 --> 977.66]  that the other authors
[977.66 --> 978.24]  didn't communicate?
[978.68 --> 978.88]  Well,
[979.00 --> 979.42]  thank goodness,
[979.56 --> 981.08]  John himself tells us
[981.08 --> 982.24]  why he wrote
[982.24 --> 983.44]  this gospel account.
[983.52 --> 984.42]  And I want to read again
[984.42 --> 984.88]  what he says
[984.88 --> 985.60]  in John 20,
[985.70 --> 985.96]  30,
[986.04 --> 986.50]  and 31.
[987.06 --> 987.72]  He writes,
[988.44 --> 989.14]  Jesus performed
[989.14 --> 990.10]  many other signs
[990.10 --> 990.60]  in the presence
[990.60 --> 991.32]  of his disciples.
[992.04 --> 993.18]  Which are not recorded
[993.18 --> 993.72]  in this book.
[993.80 --> 994.02]  Thanks,
[994.10 --> 994.26]  John.
[995.02 --> 995.66]  But these are written
[995.66 --> 996.80]  that you may believe
[996.80 --> 998.14]  that Jesus is the Messiah,
[998.24 --> 998.92]  the Son of God,
[998.96 --> 999.98]  and that by believing,
[1000.28 --> 1001.30]  you may have life
[1001.30 --> 1002.78]  in his name.
[1004.08 --> 1004.32]  Now,
[1004.40 --> 1004.84]  full disclosure,
[1004.92 --> 1005.44]  as a pastor,
[1005.54 --> 1006.20]  I find that a very
[1006.20 --> 1007.30]  tantalizing passage.
[1007.68 --> 1007.78]  You know,
[1007.84 --> 1008.26]  John's like,
[1008.34 --> 1008.44]  hey,
[1008.50 --> 1009.52]  there's way more miracles
[1009.52 --> 1010.34]  that Jesus performed.
[1011.10 --> 1011.96]  Disciples witnessed them.
[1012.34 --> 1012.96]  I saw them.
[1013.38 --> 1014.00]  They're amazing.
[1014.62 --> 1015.34]  Didn't write them down.
[1017.30 --> 1017.94]  Who knows?
[1018.00 --> 1018.86]  Maybe he got a sore wrist.
[1019.08 --> 1019.54]  He's older.
[1020.10 --> 1021.14]  Maybe he ran out of scroll.
[1021.14 --> 1021.80]  We don't know.
[1022.50 --> 1023.02]  But he's just like,
[1023.06 --> 1023.18]  you know,
[1023.24 --> 1024.30]  lots of other stuff happened.
[1024.44 --> 1025.28]  I didn't write about it.
[1025.44 --> 1026.06]  It was incredible.
[1026.34 --> 1026.66]  But then,
[1026.76 --> 1027.36]  this is what he says.
[1027.44 --> 1028.82]  I wrote what I wrote
[1028.82 --> 1030.92]  so that you may believe.
[1031.68 --> 1032.76]  That you may see
[1032.76 --> 1033.96]  that Jesus is the Messiah.
[1034.06 --> 1034.98]  That you would take hold
[1034.98 --> 1036.00]  of him in faith.
[1036.38 --> 1037.18]  That's why John
[1037.18 --> 1037.88]  wrote what he wrote.
[1037.94 --> 1038.46]  He's not just doing
[1038.46 --> 1039.08]  a biography.
[1039.52 --> 1040.08]  And you should know
[1040.08 --> 1040.62]  that sort of
[1040.62 --> 1042.26]  non-believing people
[1042.26 --> 1043.06]  who study the scriptures,
[1043.26 --> 1043.82]  they often call
[1043.82 --> 1044.56]  these gospel accounts
[1044.56 --> 1045.12]  biographies.
[1045.18 --> 1045.40]  It's like,
[1045.44 --> 1045.54]  hey,
[1045.64 --> 1046.20]  looking back at
[1046.20 --> 1046.82]  an interesting person,
[1047.12 --> 1047.78]  this is what he did,
[1047.78 --> 1048.32]  this is where he lived,
[1048.38 --> 1049.00]  this is what happened.
[1049.28 --> 1050.04]  John is not just
[1050.04 --> 1050.92]  writing a biography.
[1051.76 --> 1052.92]  He's basically saying
[1052.92 --> 1054.10]  to every person
[1054.10 --> 1054.76]  who picks up
[1054.76 --> 1055.48]  this gospel account,
[1055.54 --> 1056.46]  that includes us,
[1056.80 --> 1057.08]  he says,
[1057.28 --> 1057.98]  I want you
[1057.98 --> 1059.52]  to see what Jesus did,
[1059.60 --> 1060.60]  to hear what he said,
[1060.72 --> 1061.76]  to know what happened
[1061.76 --> 1062.36]  to him in his death
[1062.36 --> 1062.78]  and resurrection,
[1063.02 --> 1064.42]  and I want your response
[1064.42 --> 1065.90]  to be belief.
[1067.04 --> 1067.96]  I'm not interested
[1067.96 --> 1068.74]  just in information.
[1069.02 --> 1070.34]  I want you to follow
[1070.34 --> 1072.14]  this resurrected Messiah.
[1072.88 --> 1074.72]  That's what John's after.
[1075.68 --> 1076.42]  And John's day,
[1076.52 --> 1077.46]  just like our day,
[1077.96 --> 1078.50]  there's a lot of
[1078.50 --> 1079.64]  different takes on Jesus,
[1079.76 --> 1079.92]  right?
[1079.98 --> 1081.14]  They saw him as a rabbi,
[1081.22 --> 1081.94]  he's a Jewish teacher,
[1082.00 --> 1082.78]  a bit of a revolutionary,
[1083.26 --> 1084.04]  but then he died,
[1084.10 --> 1084.54]  and that's the end
[1084.54 --> 1085.34]  of the Jesus story.
[1086.06 --> 1086.64]  And today, too,
[1086.72 --> 1087.38]  there's similar stories,
[1087.44 --> 1087.58]  you know,
[1087.60 --> 1088.48]  he's a moral teacher,
[1088.66 --> 1089.24]  a good example
[1089.24 --> 1090.12]  on caring for the poor,
[1090.26 --> 1090.92]  love your neighbor,
[1091.38 --> 1092.82]  great moral instruction,
[1093.22 --> 1093.74]  just a human
[1093.74 --> 1094.66]  who lived in the first century.
[1095.08 --> 1095.90]  John is not going
[1095.90 --> 1096.62]  to let people settle
[1096.62 --> 1097.04]  for that.
[1097.58 --> 1098.64]  He's constantly saying,
[1098.90 --> 1099.66]  do you know
[1099.66 --> 1100.48]  who Jesus is?
[1100.52 --> 1101.12]  Like John 1,
[1101.18 --> 1102.22]  you have so many statements
[1102.22 --> 1103.38]  about his being there
[1103.38 --> 1104.02]  with the Father,
[1104.38 --> 1105.20]  there at creation,
[1105.46 --> 1106.86]  the fullest revelation of God,
[1106.86 --> 1108.50]  gives people the opportunity
[1108.50 --> 1109.94]  to be children of God.
[1111.16 --> 1111.96]  Even later,
[1112.12 --> 1112.92]  as we go through this book,
[1112.98 --> 1113.56]  you'll see all these
[1113.56 --> 1114.48]  I am statements.
[1114.70 --> 1115.22]  John is the book
[1115.22 --> 1116.48]  with all the I am statements
[1116.48 --> 1117.32]  that Jesus makes.
[1117.66 --> 1118.56]  And he wants to push
[1118.56 --> 1119.36]  in front of people
[1119.36 --> 1120.90]  Jesus' identity.
[1122.26 --> 1124.30]  Jesus is the bread of life.
[1124.86 --> 1126.26]  Jesus is the good shepherd.
[1126.38 --> 1127.40]  He is the way,
[1127.52 --> 1128.04]  the truth,
[1128.12 --> 1128.48]  and the life.
[1128.56 --> 1129.24]  He is the door.
[1129.34 --> 1130.44]  He is the resurrection
[1130.44 --> 1131.16]  and the life.
[1131.16 --> 1132.12]  And every time
[1132.12 --> 1132.74]  John's recording
[1132.74 --> 1133.14]  these statements,
[1133.20 --> 1133.38]  he says,
[1133.68 --> 1134.54]  you can't just disregard
[1134.54 --> 1135.06]  this guy.
[1135.82 --> 1137.06]  You have to assess
[1137.06 --> 1138.68]  the identity of Jesus.
[1139.68 --> 1140.62]  And in his gospel account,
[1140.68 --> 1141.38]  he's got some interesting
[1141.38 --> 1142.46]  stories as well
[1142.46 --> 1143.48]  that we're going to preach on
[1143.48 --> 1144.92]  of people struggling
[1144.92 --> 1146.72]  to believe who Jesus is.
[1146.78 --> 1147.62]  You've got Nicodemus,
[1147.68 --> 1148.26]  a Pharisee,
[1148.52 --> 1149.68]  a ruling person
[1149.68 --> 1150.58]  in the Jewish world.
[1150.76 --> 1152.08]  He's meeting in secret
[1152.08 --> 1152.68]  with Jesus
[1152.68 --> 1155.24]  to find out who he is.
[1155.64 --> 1157.06]  He's struggling to believe.
[1157.14 --> 1157.62]  And if you've seen
[1157.62 --> 1158.76]  that TV series,
[1158.84 --> 1159.18]  The Chosen,
[1159.18 --> 1159.72]  I think they've done
[1159.72 --> 1160.64]  some pretty cool stuff
[1160.64 --> 1161.84]  on Nicodemus
[1161.84 --> 1162.86]  trying to figure out
[1162.86 --> 1163.58]  who Jesus is.
[1163.58 --> 1164.46]  Then you've got
[1164.46 --> 1165.66]  even Thomas,
[1165.98 --> 1166.68]  who is part of
[1166.68 --> 1167.48]  Jesus' followers,
[1167.88 --> 1168.86]  post-resurrection,
[1169.02 --> 1169.48]  who's struggling
[1169.48 --> 1169.96]  to believe.
[1170.24 --> 1171.04]  And John records
[1171.04 --> 1172.04]  that Jesus beelines
[1172.04 --> 1173.20]  to Thomas to say,
[1173.98 --> 1174.70]  touch my hands,
[1174.82 --> 1175.00]  Thomas.
[1176.08 --> 1177.12]  I'm the Messiah.
[1178.24 --> 1179.68]  I've risen to life.
[1180.42 --> 1181.58]  And John is constantly
[1181.58 --> 1182.44]  inviting us
[1182.44 --> 1183.98]  as readers today
[1183.98 --> 1185.60]  to believe,
[1186.10 --> 1186.90]  to join him,
[1186.90 --> 1187.72]  the disciples,
[1188.04 --> 1188.46]  the witnesses,
[1188.68 --> 1189.44]  the early believers
[1189.44 --> 1189.90]  to say,
[1190.04 --> 1191.66]  Jesus is in fact
[1191.66 --> 1192.58]  the Messiah.
[1192.58 --> 1194.06]  He is in fact
[1194.06 --> 1195.08]  the resurrected king.
[1195.34 --> 1196.48]  He is in fact
[1196.48 --> 1197.54]  the son of God.
[1198.92 --> 1199.56]  And John,
[1199.68 --> 1200.36]  in my opinion,
[1201.42 --> 1202.52]  he wants to make it
[1202.52 --> 1204.02]  a really clear decision.
[1204.32 --> 1204.46]  You know,
[1204.48 --> 1205.14]  he's not vague
[1205.14 --> 1205.86]  about where he's at.
[1205.92 --> 1206.08]  In fact,
[1206.14 --> 1206.80]  throughout the gospel,
[1206.90 --> 1207.52]  you'll notice this too,
[1207.60 --> 1208.56]  even in 3 to 12,
[1208.74 --> 1209.60]  he makes all sorts
[1209.60 --> 1210.56]  of contrasts,
[1210.72 --> 1211.86]  light and darkness.
[1212.44 --> 1212.90]  For John,
[1212.96 --> 1213.54]  it's either you're
[1213.54 --> 1214.26]  a child of the light
[1214.26 --> 1214.96]  or you're a child
[1214.96 --> 1215.54]  of the darkness.
[1216.02 --> 1216.80]  Either you're living
[1216.80 --> 1217.52]  in faith
[1217.52 --> 1218.04]  or you're living
[1218.04 --> 1218.72]  in unbelief.
[1218.84 --> 1219.50]  Either you're living
[1219.50 --> 1220.92]  in the reality of life
[1220.92 --> 1222.22]  or the reality of death.
[1222.90 --> 1223.52]  What's the other one?
[1223.72 --> 1224.26]  Either you're living
[1224.26 --> 1224.78]  in sin
[1224.78 --> 1225.44]  or you're living
[1225.44 --> 1228.02]  in freedom from sin
[1228.02 --> 1228.46]  or you're living
[1228.46 --> 1229.16]  in condemnation.
[1229.26 --> 1230.10]  But always he's saying,
[1230.32 --> 1231.20]  it's one or the other.
[1231.38 --> 1232.56]  You have to choose.
[1233.44 --> 1234.10]  You can't just live
[1234.10 --> 1234.64]  in the vague middle.
[1234.74 --> 1235.42]  He's pushing on
[1235.42 --> 1236.08]  this new audience
[1236.08 --> 1236.26]  saying,
[1236.60 --> 1237.52]  you need to recognize
[1237.52 --> 1238.24]  Jesus' identity
[1238.24 --> 1239.34]  and you must
[1239.34 --> 1240.58]  make a decision.
[1242.02 --> 1242.18]  You know,
[1242.20 --> 1242.98]  I think of C.S. Lewis
[1242.98 --> 1243.42]  who said,
[1244.18 --> 1244.38]  you know,
[1244.38 --> 1245.32]  of a modern audience,
[1245.40 --> 1245.60]  he says,
[1245.68 --> 1246.58]  you can't just say
[1246.58 --> 1247.40]  he's a good moral teacher.
[1247.84 --> 1249.18]  Either Jesus is a liar,
[1249.18 --> 1251.10]  he's a lunatic
[1251.10 --> 1252.38]  or he's a lord.
[1253.38 --> 1254.16]  And I think John
[1254.16 --> 1255.10]  is doing much the same
[1255.10 --> 1255.42]  where he's saying,
[1255.54 --> 1256.78]  it's either this or that.
[1257.32 --> 1258.34]  You have to choose.
[1258.44 --> 1260.06]  You have to make a decision.
[1260.78 --> 1261.58]  And praise the Lord
[1261.58 --> 1262.46]  that so many people
[1262.46 --> 1263.64]  who've read just through
[1263.64 --> 1264.58]  the Gospel of John
[1264.58 --> 1265.06]  have said,
[1265.40 --> 1266.38]  I believe.
[1268.56 --> 1269.62]  But there's more going on
[1269.62 --> 1270.38]  in just that sort of
[1270.38 --> 1271.12]  make a decision.
[1271.24 --> 1271.36]  In fact,
[1271.40 --> 1271.90]  some people have said
[1271.90 --> 1272.40]  this is sort of
[1272.40 --> 1273.50]  an altar call passage
[1273.50 --> 1273.92]  where it's like,
[1274.02 --> 1274.68]  you read the Gospel of John
[1274.68 --> 1275.46]  and you have to make a decision.
[1275.78 --> 1277.00]  John wants you to decide
[1277.00 --> 1278.12]  sort of to make that decision.
[1278.12 --> 1279.38]  And that's absolutely true.
[1279.66 --> 1280.58]  But I want to point out
[1280.58 --> 1281.50]  the actual rendering
[1281.50 --> 1281.94]  of the Greek.
[1282.02 --> 1282.66]  I won't geek you out
[1282.66 --> 1283.36]  too much on this
[1283.36 --> 1284.04]  because I know
[1284.04 --> 1285.20]  most of us don't love Greek.
[1285.66 --> 1287.24]  But the way John renders it
[1287.24 --> 1288.52]  literally is,
[1288.88 --> 1290.12]  but these words are written
[1290.12 --> 1292.90]  that you may be believers.
[1293.86 --> 1294.80]  And that's an important frame.
[1294.86 --> 1295.78]  Not just may believe,
[1295.90 --> 1297.36]  but be believers.
[1297.62 --> 1298.26]  And he's calling people
[1298.26 --> 1299.62]  not just to a one-time decision,
[1300.02 --> 1300.78]  but to an ongoing,
[1301.04 --> 1301.52]  active,
[1301.82 --> 1302.56]  responsive,
[1303.04 --> 1304.54]  lifelong belief.
[1305.28 --> 1306.80]  It's belief for the long haul.
[1308.12 --> 1310.20]  One of the commentators
[1310.20 --> 1311.12]  on the Gospel of John,
[1311.18 --> 1312.02]  his name is Dale Brunner.
[1312.80 --> 1313.60]  He makes this comment,
[1313.70 --> 1314.58]  and I think this is appropriate
[1314.58 --> 1315.26]  even as we think
[1315.26 --> 1316.28]  about our new members class.
[1317.00 --> 1317.36]  He writes,
[1317.50 --> 1319.18]  Believing as we all know
[1319.18 --> 1321.30]  is an ongoing series
[1321.30 --> 1322.30]  of life decisions
[1322.30 --> 1325.58]  rather than a once-in-a-lifetime decision.
[1326.48 --> 1328.30]  Our Gospel wants us
[1328.30 --> 1329.82]  not only to become believers,
[1330.02 --> 1331.54]  but to be believers
[1331.54 --> 1332.44]  day after day,
[1332.60 --> 1333.48]  Sunday after Sunday,
[1333.74 --> 1335.06]  until he comes again.
[1335.06 --> 1336.62]  You know,
[1336.66 --> 1336.88]  Marie,
[1336.98 --> 1337.38]  I think you made
[1337.38 --> 1338.64]  a really appropriate comment
[1338.64 --> 1339.78]  that too,
[1339.98 --> 1340.16]  you know,
[1340.22 --> 1340.84]  about this new
[1340.84 --> 1342.34]  welcome of new members.
[1342.48 --> 1343.22]  There's almost a sense
[1343.22 --> 1344.12]  in which all of us
[1344.12 --> 1344.76]  every Sunday
[1344.76 --> 1346.14]  are being called
[1346.14 --> 1347.40]  to recommit our faith.
[1348.04 --> 1349.02]  I find that at baptism,
[1349.14 --> 1349.88]  I find myself saying,
[1349.96 --> 1350.66]  do I believe this?
[1350.70 --> 1351.70]  Is this how I'm raising my kids?
[1351.74 --> 1352.54]  Is this my identity
[1352.54 --> 1353.06]  as a believer?
[1353.50 --> 1354.32]  And in the same way
[1354.32 --> 1355.20]  as we see people saying,
[1355.30 --> 1355.44]  yes,
[1355.52 --> 1356.26]  I believe in Jesus.
[1356.36 --> 1357.24]  I believe the story.
[1357.40 --> 1358.12]  I want to follow him
[1358.12 --> 1358.52]  in this church.
[1358.58 --> 1359.00]  It's a way of saying,
[1359.24 --> 1360.96]  we are recommitting ourselves
[1360.96 --> 1363.20]  as disciples of Jesus Christ
[1363.20 --> 1364.04]  week in,
[1364.22 --> 1364.60]  week out.
[1364.60 --> 1365.86]  And we all know,
[1366.34 --> 1367.30]  we'll come back to this,
[1367.72 --> 1369.08]  that belief is not easy
[1369.08 --> 1370.48]  in the Western world.
[1371.44 --> 1373.00]  We can relate to Thomas
[1373.00 --> 1374.58]  and even Nicodemus
[1374.58 --> 1375.22]  in the struggle.
[1375.86 --> 1376.60]  And so we are invited
[1376.60 --> 1377.20]  to a community
[1377.20 --> 1378.14]  that is constantly
[1378.14 --> 1379.60]  recommitting active,
[1380.58 --> 1381.78]  lifelong belief in Jesus
[1381.78 --> 1383.28]  until he comes again.
[1386.96 --> 1388.30]  But I want to finish
[1388.30 --> 1389.88]  where John finishes
[1389.88 --> 1391.06]  with that statement
[1391.06 --> 1391.84]  in John 20.
[1391.84 --> 1393.80]  He's not just interested
[1393.80 --> 1394.58]  in making a list
[1394.58 --> 1395.58]  of doctrinal statements
[1395.58 --> 1396.36]  about what it is
[1396.36 --> 1397.06]  that we need to believe,
[1397.16 --> 1398.24]  that he's the son of God,
[1398.30 --> 1399.00]  that he was there
[1399.00 --> 1400.02]  from the beginning of creation,
[1400.10 --> 1400.90]  that he gives the right
[1400.90 --> 1401.92]  to become children of God.
[1402.26 --> 1402.50]  Yes,
[1402.58 --> 1403.96]  that all matters incredibly.
[1404.46 --> 1405.22]  But John finishes
[1405.22 --> 1405.90]  by saying,
[1406.26 --> 1407.28]  by believing that Jesus
[1407.28 --> 1408.28]  is the Messiah,
[1408.40 --> 1409.00]  the son of God,
[1409.06 --> 1410.82]  and that by believing that,
[1411.70 --> 1412.90]  we may have life
[1412.90 --> 1414.06]  in his name.
[1415.76 --> 1416.92]  John wants everyone
[1416.92 --> 1417.72]  who reads his gospel
[1417.72 --> 1418.50]  to have life
[1418.50 --> 1420.02]  in Jesus' name.
[1420.02 --> 1420.96]  Not just information,
[1421.48 --> 1422.24]  not just some good,
[1422.32 --> 1423.02]  important doctrine,
[1423.38 --> 1424.16]  but life.
[1425.32 --> 1426.18]  And at the end of the day,
[1426.26 --> 1427.26]  I am so convinced,
[1427.40 --> 1428.30]  even as I do ministry
[1428.30 --> 1429.30]  here in our own church,
[1429.52 --> 1430.48]  the reason people
[1430.48 --> 1431.12]  become Christians,
[1431.76 --> 1432.96]  the reason we say yes
[1432.96 --> 1433.86]  to Jesus Christ
[1433.86 --> 1435.16]  is a work of the Spirit
[1435.16 --> 1435.98]  that helps us see
[1435.98 --> 1437.38]  that yes, indeed,
[1438.00 --> 1439.06]  this is truth
[1439.06 --> 1441.30]  and this is life.
[1442.10 --> 1442.98]  I don't think we should
[1442.98 --> 1443.86]  ever be in the business
[1443.86 --> 1444.84]  of forcing people,
[1445.22 --> 1446.04]  it's never gone well,
[1446.10 --> 1446.32]  by the way,
[1446.34 --> 1446.66]  in the past,
[1446.70 --> 1447.40]  of forcing people
[1447.40 --> 1448.24]  into the Christian faith.
[1448.24 --> 1449.92]  It is life
[1449.92 --> 1451.16]  and when people see it,
[1451.54 --> 1452.04]  when they see it
[1452.04 --> 1452.58]  living in others,
[1452.66 --> 1453.18]  when they see it
[1453.18 --> 1453.60]  as they read
[1453.60 --> 1454.04]  through the scriptures,
[1454.30 --> 1455.08]  they respond saying,
[1455.22 --> 1457.68]  yes, I want life.
[1459.74 --> 1461.10]  I began by mentioning
[1461.10 --> 1462.40]  that many people
[1462.40 --> 1462.62]  who have read
[1462.62 --> 1463.40]  through the gospel of John
[1463.40 --> 1464.20]  have finished that gospel
[1464.20 --> 1464.50]  and said,
[1464.74 --> 1466.12]  I want to know more
[1466.12 --> 1467.76]  and this is a beautiful
[1467.76 --> 1468.80]  story of Jesus
[1468.80 --> 1469.62]  and I want to finish
[1469.62 --> 1470.14]  with a story
[1470.14 --> 1470.68]  about someone
[1470.68 --> 1472.16]  who had that same experience.
[1472.84 --> 1473.98]  His name is Professor Ho
[1473.98 --> 1474.80]  and I got to know him
[1474.80 --> 1476.04]  about seven years ago now.
[1476.04 --> 1477.60]  He moved to Canada
[1477.60 --> 1478.44]  from China
[1478.44 --> 1479.70]  and he was studying,
[1479.84 --> 1480.22]  actually doing
[1480.22 --> 1481.22]  post-doctoral work
[1481.22 --> 1482.00]  at SFU
[1482.00 --> 1483.32]  and he got to know
[1483.32 --> 1484.24]  a colleague there
[1484.24 --> 1485.38]  who was part of our church,
[1485.44 --> 1485.84]  a professor
[1485.84 --> 1486.42]  and that colleague
[1486.42 --> 1487.36]  invited him to our church
[1487.36 --> 1487.88]  at the time
[1487.88 --> 1489.76]  and Ho then began
[1489.76 --> 1490.26]  this journey
[1490.26 --> 1491.02]  of trying to make sense
[1491.02 --> 1491.52]  of Christianity.
[1491.70 --> 1492.74]  It started as sort
[1492.74 --> 1493.76]  of a cultural thing.
[1493.96 --> 1494.48]  He was told
[1494.48 --> 1495.06]  like many people
[1495.06 --> 1495.56]  who come to Canada
[1495.56 --> 1496.20]  that Canada
[1496.20 --> 1496.96]  is a Christian country
[1496.96 --> 1497.82]  and we're like,
[1497.88 --> 1498.12]  actually,
[1498.22 --> 1498.82]  no, it's not.
[1499.22 --> 1499.86]  Christianity is a very
[1499.86 --> 1500.84]  small part of our country
[1500.84 --> 1501.34]  but it's definitely
[1501.34 --> 1502.26]  not the dominant religion
[1502.26 --> 1502.96]  and it definitely
[1502.96 --> 1503.96]  isn't shaping society
[1503.96 --> 1505.20]  but he wanted to know
[1505.20 --> 1505.66]  about this thing
[1505.66 --> 1506.18]  that's Christianity
[1506.18 --> 1507.08]  and so he started
[1507.08 --> 1507.74]  reading the Bible
[1507.74 --> 1508.68]  and his friend
[1508.68 --> 1510.04]  got him on the Gospel of John.
[1511.04 --> 1512.44]  Read through the Gospel of John
[1512.44 --> 1514.48]  a bazillion questions
[1514.48 --> 1516.40]  as a Chinese person
[1516.40 --> 1517.16]  trying to make sense
[1517.16 --> 1518.16]  of this ancient document
[1518.16 --> 1518.98]  living in Canada
[1518.98 --> 1519.76]  working through it
[1519.76 --> 1520.54]  but that led him
[1520.54 --> 1521.08]  to read through
[1521.08 --> 1522.04]  other Gospels.
[1522.50 --> 1522.96]  That led him
[1522.96 --> 1523.36]  to read through
[1523.36 --> 1523.92]  the New Testament.
[1524.10 --> 1524.46]  That led him
[1524.46 --> 1525.40]  eventually to read
[1525.40 --> 1526.34]  through the entire Bible
[1526.34 --> 1527.82]  and this is actually
[1527.82 --> 1528.46]  a funny story.
[1528.98 --> 1529.88]  The turning point
[1529.88 --> 1531.08]  of this professor's life
[1531.08 --> 1532.22]  was on a Sunday morning
[1532.22 --> 1532.90]  we had communion
[1532.90 --> 1533.54]  in our church
[1533.54 --> 1534.08]  and the elders
[1534.08 --> 1534.66]  were bringing it
[1534.66 --> 1535.16]  to each row
[1535.16 --> 1535.42]  I don't know
[1535.42 --> 1535.96]  if you know that
[1535.96 --> 1536.36]  sometimes
[1536.36 --> 1537.04]  the way to be a communion
[1537.04 --> 1538.36]  you bring these plates
[1538.36 --> 1538.94]  to each row
[1538.94 --> 1540.24]  and it came to his row
[1540.24 --> 1540.72]  and the professor
[1540.72 --> 1541.36]  who brought him to church
[1541.36 --> 1542.24]  was sitting beside him
[1542.24 --> 1543.12]  and Professor Ho
[1543.12 --> 1544.36]  went to get the elements
[1544.36 --> 1545.40]  and his friend's like
[1545.40 --> 1546.14]  hey you don't need
[1546.14 --> 1546.84]  to have this meal
[1546.84 --> 1547.90]  you don't believe this stuff
[1547.90 --> 1549.56]  and he's just being kind
[1549.56 --> 1550.08]  it wasn't like
[1550.08 --> 1550.68]  an unkind thing
[1550.68 --> 1551.08]  he's like no
[1551.08 --> 1552.00]  you don't have to participate
[1552.00 --> 1552.40]  this is
[1552.40 --> 1553.74]  and he said no I do
[1553.74 --> 1555.08]  he's like you do
[1555.08 --> 1556.22]  and they started having
[1556.22 --> 1556.92]  this conversation
[1556.92 --> 1557.62]  about what he believed
[1557.62 --> 1558.50]  right there and then
[1558.50 --> 1559.44]  as communion's going out
[1559.44 --> 1560.30]  like so you believe it
[1560.30 --> 1561.18]  well if you believe it
[1561.18 --> 1561.46]  then you should
[1561.46 --> 1562.04]  anyway
[1562.04 --> 1562.88]  he took communion
[1562.88 --> 1563.02]  communion
[1563.02 --> 1564.68]  and on came his journey
[1564.68 --> 1565.84]  of saying I believe this stuff
[1565.84 --> 1567.58]  but what was interesting
[1567.58 --> 1568.44]  is that was really
[1568.44 --> 1569.38]  a beginning of a hard
[1569.38 --> 1569.96]  journey for him
[1569.96 --> 1570.70]  because when he finished
[1570.70 --> 1572.04]  his postdoctoral work
[1572.04 --> 1572.90]  he went back to China
[1572.90 --> 1574.28]  to teaching at a university
[1574.28 --> 1575.54]  where it's very complicated
[1575.54 --> 1576.38]  very risky
[1576.38 --> 1577.04]  and controversial
[1577.04 --> 1577.82]  to be a Christian
[1577.82 --> 1579.54]  and also to a wife
[1579.54 --> 1580.06]  and a daughter
[1580.06 --> 1581.38]  who had no idea
[1581.38 --> 1582.04]  what's going on
[1582.04 --> 1582.46]  in his life
[1582.46 --> 1583.72]  why he's going to church
[1583.72 --> 1584.84]  why he's reading a bible
[1584.84 --> 1586.24]  like it made no sense to them
[1586.24 --> 1586.80]  this journey was
[1586.80 --> 1587.80]  an individual journey
[1587.80 --> 1589.38]  apart from his own community
[1589.38 --> 1590.66]  and so he asked us
[1590.66 --> 1591.24]  to pray for him
[1591.24 --> 1592.12]  when he went back to China
[1592.12 --> 1593.46]  and his family
[1593.46 --> 1594.08]  would understand
[1594.08 --> 1594.80]  that his colleagues
[1594.80 --> 1595.34]  would understand
[1595.34 --> 1595.88]  that he would know
[1595.88 --> 1596.78]  how to maintain
[1596.78 --> 1597.92]  his faith in a place
[1597.92 --> 1598.88]  that's a fairly hostile
[1598.88 --> 1599.40]  environment
[1599.40 --> 1600.78]  and we got a letter
[1600.78 --> 1601.46]  back from him
[1601.46 --> 1602.74]  several months later
[1602.74 --> 1604.08]  and I want to read
[1604.08 --> 1604.84]  for you what he said
[1604.84 --> 1605.74]  about his own wife
[1605.74 --> 1606.92]  I'm quoting what he wrote
[1606.92 --> 1607.14]  here
[1607.14 --> 1608.96]  his wife came to him
[1608.96 --> 1609.78]  I'll just give the context
[1609.78 --> 1610.66]  you know months
[1610.66 --> 1611.50]  after his return
[1611.50 --> 1612.46]  and this is what she said
[1612.46 --> 1613.30]  she said
[1613.30 --> 1614.34]  I don't know yet
[1614.34 --> 1615.38]  about Christianity
[1615.38 --> 1617.14]  I don't know
[1617.14 --> 1618.52]  why you became one
[1618.52 --> 1620.48]  but I do know this
[1620.48 --> 1622.90]  you have changed
[1622.90 --> 1625.24]  since becoming a Christian
[1625.24 --> 1627.12]  and since going to church
[1627.12 --> 1629.88]  and if this is the kind of change
[1629.88 --> 1630.90]  that takes place
[1630.90 --> 1632.12]  in a church
[1632.12 --> 1634.74]  I want to go with you
[1634.74 --> 1636.70]  and his wife
[1636.70 --> 1638.12]  eventually became a Christian
[1638.12 --> 1639.84]  and at this very moment
[1639.84 --> 1641.18]  they are both part of a church
[1641.18 --> 1643.36]  and we praise the Lord
[1643.36 --> 1645.20]  for the power of the gospel
[1645.20 --> 1646.42]  we praise the Lord
[1646.42 --> 1647.28]  that Professor Ho
[1647.28 --> 1648.12]  just as a sort of
[1648.12 --> 1648.96]  cultural experience
[1648.96 --> 1650.08]  he wanted to read
[1650.08 --> 1650.78]  through John
[1650.78 --> 1652.66]  and what he found
[1652.66 --> 1655.14]  like countless millions
[1655.14 --> 1655.92]  of believers
[1655.92 --> 1656.64]  throughout the ages
[1656.64 --> 1657.72]  including us this morning
[1657.72 --> 1659.04]  is that the gospel
[1659.04 --> 1660.42]  is life
[1660.42 --> 1661.92]  and what his wife
[1661.92 --> 1662.76]  was naming
[1662.76 --> 1664.72]  as she interacted with him
[1664.72 --> 1665.76]  and had questions for him
[1665.76 --> 1666.88]  she recognized that
[1666.88 --> 1667.72]  I don't know what to make
[1667.72 --> 1668.34]  of what he believes
[1668.34 --> 1669.14]  I don't know what to make
[1669.14 --> 1669.92]  of this thing called church
[1669.92 --> 1671.02]  but I see
[1671.02 --> 1672.66]  life
[1672.66 --> 1674.88]  and John says
[1674.88 --> 1676.06]  to each and every reader
[1676.06 --> 1677.36]  of this gospel account
[1677.36 --> 1678.94]  read this
[1678.94 --> 1680.54]  so that you may believe
[1680.54 --> 1681.94]  that Jesus is the Messiah
[1681.94 --> 1682.80]  the Son of God
[1682.80 --> 1684.60]  and by believing in him
[1684.60 --> 1687.34]  you get life
[1687.34 --> 1689.18]  as Jesus himself
[1689.18 --> 1690.34]  who says in John 10
[1690.34 --> 1692.50]  I am the life
[1692.50 --> 1694.58]  whoever comes to me
[1694.58 --> 1697.12]  gets eternal life
[1697.12 --> 1698.60]  Amen
[1698.60 --> 1704.28]  Father we thank you so much
[1704.28 --> 1705.66]  that you compelled John
[1705.66 --> 1706.58]  to write this gospel
[1706.58 --> 1708.50]  and we thank you
[1708.50 --> 1709.44]  that we have this Bible
[1709.44 --> 1709.94]  in our hands
[1709.94 --> 1710.54]  that we can read
[1710.54 --> 1711.54]  and we know that this word
[1711.54 --> 1712.20]  is truth
[1712.20 --> 1714.30]  and even as we begin
[1714.30 --> 1715.36]  this journey of John
[1715.36 --> 1715.88]  together Lord
[1715.88 --> 1716.88]  we pray that it would be
[1716.88 --> 1717.82]  good news to us
[1717.82 --> 1719.22]  that your spirit
[1719.22 --> 1720.50]  would stir in us
[1720.50 --> 1721.16]  a belief
[1721.16 --> 1722.86]  that your spirit
[1722.86 --> 1723.56]  would work in us
[1723.56 --> 1724.28]  to places where there
[1724.28 --> 1724.98]  is frustration
[1724.98 --> 1726.52]  where there is weariness
[1726.52 --> 1727.66]  where there is doubt
[1727.66 --> 1729.42]  and we ask that you
[1729.42 --> 1730.36]  would create in us
[1730.36 --> 1731.54]  over the course of this time
[1731.54 --> 1732.58]  reading through this gospel
[1732.58 --> 1733.92]  belief
[1733.92 --> 1736.14]  and that that would flow
[1736.14 --> 1737.04]  through us
[1737.04 --> 1737.90]  to our families
[1737.90 --> 1738.90]  our workplaces
[1738.90 --> 1739.60]  and our city
[1739.60 --> 1741.28]  to you be the glory
[1741.28 --> 1742.10]  Amen
[1742.10 --> 1744.50]  I invite you to stand
[1744.50 --> 1745.18]  and sing with me
[1745.18 --> 1746.62]  our song of response
[1746.62 --> 1747.10]  overcome
[1747.10 --> 1747.40]  Abraham
[1747.90 --> 1760.52]  Thank you
[1760.52 --> 1762.72]  and thank you
[1762.72 --> 1762.88]  you
