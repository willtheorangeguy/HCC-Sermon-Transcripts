[0.00 → 15.36] with the opportunity now for the cornerstone kids ages three to grade three to head upstairs
[15.36 → 22.88] also I want to encourage you to take on opportunity if we have an opportunity to
[22.88 → 30.40] give, and we give for the offering we can use the church app or there's also a debit machine in
[30.40 → 36.24] in the back after the service so, but we encourage you to give your offering as well
[36.24 → 50.24] this morning we are going to carry on in our study of James the letter to James that James wrote
[50.24 → 57.60] in a series that's called faith that works and that's sort of the heart of what James is about
[57.60 → 67.80] I'm going to show you a slide of my day timer and on October 16th hopefully it's going to come up there
[67.80 → 68.80] oh there it is
[68.80 → 81.20] I this is two actually two entries in one here the first when we decided we arranged our preaching
[81.20 → 90.96] date Jonathan and Pastor Jonathan and Pastor Dave and Pastor and me Pastor me then we know we
[90.96 → 97.52] just picked dates and so October 16th I was going to preach I put my name down then we worked on the
[97.52 → 104.08] series and titles and split it all up so then that I put down the title, so I'd remember and the title
[104.08 → 109.60] was watch your mouth so every time I read this now I know my daytime until October 16th says Sid watch your
[109.60 → 117.12] mouth, and I'm pretty sure my wife had a hand in this somehow so but anyway the truth is this
[117.84 → 124.96] when I write a sermon I'm sure the other pastors well would agree I do start with myself and I want to
[124.96 → 135.04] encourage you to do the same as you listen don't just go oh man so-and-so should hear this message
[136.08 → 144.88] start with the question of how do I need to watch my mouth so with that in mind let's read the passage the
[144.88 → 147.04] passage that is for you
[147.04 → 151.04] James 3 1 through 18
[151.04 → 158.08] not many of you should become teachers my fellow believers because you know that we who teach or
[158.08 → 160.80] preach for that matter will be judged more strictly
[160.80 → 164.00] we all stumble in many ways
[164.00 → 170.32] anyone who is never at fault in what he what they say is perfect able to keep their whole body in check
[170.32 → 176.56] in other words they don't exist when we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us we
[176.56 → 181.84] can turn the whole animal or take ships for example, although they are so large and are driven by strong
[181.84 → 188.96] winds they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go likewise the tongue is a small
[188.96 → 196.40] part of the body, but it makes great boast consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark the
[196.40 → 202.64] tongue also is the fire a world of evil among parts of the body it corrupts the whole body
[202.64 → 208.08] sets the whole course of one's life on fire and is itself set on fire by hell
[209.28 → 215.52] all kinds of animals birds reptiles sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind but no
[215.52 → 220.48] human being can tame the tongue it is a restless evil full of deadly poison
[220.48 → 226.88] with the tongue we praise our father and with it, we curse human beings who have been made in god's
[226.88 → 234.08] likeness out of the same mouth come praise and cursing my brothers and sisters this should not be
[234.96 → 240.00] can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring my brothers and sisters can a fig tree
[240.00 → 247.76] bear olives or a grapevine bear figs neither can a salt spring produce fresh water who is wise and
[247.76 → 254.32] understanding among you let them show it by their good life by deeds done in humility that comes from
[254.32 → 260.48] wisdom but if you harbour bitter envy and selfish ambition in your heart do not boast about it or
[260.48 → 267.52] deny the truth such wisdom does not come down from heaven but is earthly and spiritual demonic
[268.16 → 273.84] for where you have envy and selfish ambition there you find disorder and every evil practice but the
[273.84 → 282.40] wisdom that comes from heaven is first pure then peace-loving considerate submissive full of
[282.40 → 290.96] mercy and good fruit impartial and sincere peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness
[292.32 → 293.12] the word of the lord
[296.16 → 302.64] as you notice this is written to believers and in it those who love Jesus are challenged to let the
[302.64 → 311.04] gospel be displayed in word and in deed the gospel shows up in our actions in our behaviours and in
[311.04 → 320.48] our words it shows up in how we speak earlier pastor David when we spoke on jams 1 read us this passage
[320.48 → 326.80] where it says my dear brothers and sisters take note of this everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak
[326.80 → 332.80] slow to become angry because human anger did not produce the righteousness that god desires
[335.12 → 342.48] and there are too many examples even in churches where people who are quick to speak and slow to listen
[342.48 → 351.76] bring about harm and thus bring disharmony we all have seen that around us as I said even in churches
[351.76 → 359.28] and this can get worse when teachers slash preachers have tongues that are out of control
[360.32 → 365.84] well jams right not many of you should presume to be teachers because you know that we who teach preach
[365.84 → 373.12] will be judged more strictly that ought to give us some caution if we think we're going to be teachers
[373.12 → 384.24] as a pastor I remind myself that I need to weigh my words carefully I'm not by nature a very good listener
[385.04 → 390.00] but I have learned over time to become a better one great thanks to my wife for that too
[391.44 → 397.76] and it's a challenge as a pastor to walk alongside a church full of people with all kinds of thoughts
[397.76 → 406.80] and opinions on all kinds of topics you don't all think the same way isn't that surprising in my younger
[406.80 → 417.04] days being right was a goal and a debate was an opportunity to win something fortunately I grew up at least to some degree
[418.80 → 426.96] I am convicted by god's word when I read today's passage it hits me personally SID watch your mouth
[428.40 → 435.44] that's why uh jams right show by your good life that your works are done with gentleness born of
[435.44 → 442.96] wisdom gentleness born of wisdom i I've been struck over the years by the word gentle you should do a study
[442.96 → 451.04] of that sometime it shows up a lot in scripture gentleness and yet sometimes I'm offended by the fact of how
[451.04 → 458.96] ungentle some Christians are one writer describes this wisdom from above and living that way as
[458.96 → 464.16] lifting from your core you know how you're supposed to do that when you lift heavy things up you lift
[464.16 → 471.12] from your core and and and he says we need to speak from our core we need to speak from the place of
[471.12 → 479.60] centrality that is within us speak from what drives our lives' wisdom jams right from above is pure is
[479.60 → 487.92] gentle is considerate sometimes I think we treat words like gentleness and considerate consideration
[487.92 → 493.44] and humility and humility and all those things almost like the old beauty contest the miss congeniality
[493.44 → 499.92] thing it's almost like the prize you really kind of don't want to win and yet it's the heart of the thing
[501.20 → 509.84] and then when I see loud and abrasive and self-righteous talk in the name of Jesus well it's wrong it's sad, and it needs to stop
[509.84 → 519.28] jams seems to be highlighting the critical distance between the head and the heart and what lies in between
[519.28 → 526.40] that is the tongue and that's what he says that in that gap is the tongue why would jams say something
[526.40 → 531.28] so strong that like this that the tongue is a restless evil full of deadly poison
[533.76 → 537.92] you ever stick your tongue out go to restless evil deadly poison
[539.84 → 540.72] yet it's true
[543.04 → 547.20] with it, we bless god and with it, we curse one another
[548.48 → 552.96] some might ask well what's what's the topic that I'm cursing over doesn't matter we're not supposed
[552.96 → 559.36] to be cursing one another it didn't even give us the topics jams challenges us to look at what comes
[559.36 → 568.56] out of our mouths as indicative of what lies inside if you have a lot of bitter talk flowing out of your
[568.56 → 576.88] mouth guess what's inside if you have a lot of anger spewing out guess what's inside that's what jams is
[576.88 → 585.20] saying here all the strife coming out reflects strife inside, and then he points to the incongruities
[585.20 → 592.24] right figs don't come from olive trees salt water doesn't come from fresh water what's leaking out of you
[592.24 → 597.52] that's what's inside
[598.08 → 604.48] more and probably a better indicator than you putting on a face and pretending things that's not what's inside
[606.56 → 614.32] our tongues he says are like sparks that cause fires words can create new huge messes maybe you've
[614.96 → 617.84] noticed that maybe you've contributed to that
[619.04 → 624.80] we in bc certainly should understand how sparks consider blaze the forest even burn whole towns down
[626.64 → 632.40] jams uses other metaphors he said the tongues like a rudder it's small, but it can direct the whole ship
[632.40 → 639.84] like a bit in a horse's mouth can direct the horse, so the tongue can direct in positive ways as well
[639.84 → 647.68] it's not always a bad thing that's not what he's saying here right there can be the power of encouragement
[648.40 → 658.56] the power of apology forgiveness the power of silence of keeping your mouth shut
[660.96 → 666.80] imagine that or we can do the other thing we can push people away we can tear them down we can be
[666.80 → 673.76] obnoxious we can gossip we can ruin reputations we can believe our own lies all kinds of ways we can
[673.76 → 682.00] misuse words and so jams asked who can tame this restless beast the tongue and his answer is no one can
[684.72 → 693.36] saint Augustine says jams is implying here that only god can and that's true our sinful nature demands we
[693.36 → 698.32] serve ourselves over anyone else that really is the heart of what sin is we want to serve ourselves
[698.32 → 706.08] more than anyone else we want what we want what we want and that all that matters and so yes we praise
[706.08 → 716.08] god, and then we gossip and attack people with words we do both those things and on display is our self-centredness
[716.08 → 719.28] and left to ourselves this won't change
[721.68 → 726.32] hear me well we are often in great danger trying to be right instead of righteous
[728.40 → 730.08] trying to be right instead of righteous
[732.48 → 737.20] I'm not suggesting we don't try to be right, but it doesn't always lead to righteousness then you know
[737.20 → 743.92] you're on the wrong track and without power outside ourselves self-righteousness will be the path that we
[743.92 → 755.44] are doing good we're defending the truth we're setting people straight for their own good
[759.36 → 766.64] not seeing the harm we do in the process and again I'm not suggesting we're not telling people truth
[767.76 → 773.76] more suggesting motivation I think remember the heart of jams is about our faith
[773.76 → 781.44] showing up in our behaviour and at the core of our faith is the death of self so if you're telling
[781.44 → 786.64] the truth I was just talking to somebody between services, and they were talking about a political
[786.64 → 791.84] person that I won't name and you know they're basically saying you know when I talk to people about
[791.84 → 795.68] that person I want to tell them how awful that person is
[795.68 → 807.84] and I get that, but then we need to check out well what so what is the motive here to slam that person okay
[808.64 → 819.12] it's time for you to shut up time for you to be quiet because your motive is not where it should be your tongue is running the show here
[819.12 → 824.32] is
[824.56 → 829.12] jams is talking about submitting our will for the lord's will
[830.96 → 838.40] and not assuming they're the same thing you might think well of course but no you'd be surprised how
[838.40 → 844.48] often we think our will and the lord's will are likely in sync, and they're not
[848.80 → 849.36] they're not
[850.24 → 855.84] god calls us to submit to him because in him there is life
[858.08 → 863.28] our first parents Adam and eve chose to submit to the lie that they could be like god and I think we
[863.28 → 865.04] often continue to do the same thing
[867.04 → 871.76] why when we look at jams let me just read it to you again but jams uh
[872.40 → 878.56] 3 the verses 3 13 through 17 who is wise and understanding among you let them show it by their good life
[879.12 → 881.84] by deeds done in humility that comes from wisdom
[882.88 → 888.56] right don't harbour envy and selfish ambition don't boast about you know that and or deny the truth
[888.88 → 892.72] such wisdom does not come from heaven it's earthly unspiritual demonic
[892.72 → 898.32] where you have envy and selfish ambition there you find disorder and every evil practice that's the fruit
[899.44 → 900.72] of not walking
[902.00 → 907.20] according to god's will but wisdom that comes from heaven is first it's pure
[907.84 → 909.84] okay and here's the word peace-loving
[911.60 → 913.28] that's what is that the result peace
[914.16 → 914.96] considerate
[916.56 → 917.36] submissive
[918.40 → 919.36] full of mercy
[919.36 → 922.72] and good fruit impartial sincere
[923.28 → 929.84] peace-making all that's what's going on here and so in jams 4 I'm jumping a little bit ahead to next week
[929.84 → 935.04] but jams 4 verse 7 that's why jams writes submit yourselves
[935.68 → 940.40] then to god all right step one submit yourself to god then
[940.40 → 942.96] resist the devil, and he will flee from you
[944.56 → 949.12] and he will flee from you, you you submit to god knowing you don't have the strength you don't have
[949.12 → 953.92] the wisdom it comes outside of you and then god can work through you
[957.20 → 959.84] and then instead of asking what's best for us, we will
[960.48 → 962.72] more naturally learn to ask what's best for others
[962.72 → 967.84] let me give you a suggestion that I need to give myself regularly
[968.96 → 976.16] I ask myself whatever the topic might be how will I lovingly share this truth and again also
[976.16 → 983.12] recognizing its my perception of that truth but how sometimes it's also just pure basic truth but how
[983.12 → 988.80] how will I lovingly share this truth and if I can't do it lovingly then I'm going to be quiet
[991.12 → 993.04] I'm going to not say anything
[994.72 → 998.08] do I do that all the time no but I try
[1000.00 → 1004.56] sometimes I wish there would be a lot less talk on all kinds of issues
[1007.44 → 1011.68] sometimes when I listen to debates going on I want to jump in the middle of it and say listen
[1011.68 → 1015.20] let's improve this situation and everybody be quiet
[1016.88 → 1022.64] because it would probably improve the situation you know I was thinking of job right poor job all
[1022.64 → 1027.12] the horrible things that happened to him, he loses his kids he gets his health is gone all terrible
[1027.12 → 1032.88] things lose all his finances his work and as what life is falling apart and his good friends come along
[1032.88 → 1039.76] to support him how do they support him for seven days they sit with him seven days
[1039.76 → 1047.12] not minutes not hours seven days they sit with him, it's called a sitting shiva, and they just sit in silence
[1047.12 → 1054.16] with him in support it's when after that when they begin to speak that things fall apart relationally
[1056.40 → 1062.24] and I'm sure they thought they were simply setting job straight
[1062.24 → 1070.64] well Joe come on man look at your life surely you did something wrong that's logical right
[1072.56 → 1079.84] right, and they were going to suddenly figure it out and then jams says not many of you should be
[1079.84 → 1085.60] teachers I know teachers who shouldn't be teachers I know pastors who probably shouldn't be pastors
[1085.60 → 1091.92] I know some fine people who aren't teachers but ought to be
[1095.04 → 1100.88] perhaps jams is referring to people in his own church some self-proclaimed teachers, and he says and
[1100.88 → 1107.60] he starts in the right place who is wise and understanding among you let's start there who's wise and
[1107.60 → 1114.64] understanding and how are we going to determine that a good teacher isn't simply someone who can talk a
[1114.64 → 1119.28] good line but someone rather who lives a good life full of humility
[1122.00 → 1124.40] we've made talking skills way too important
[1127.28 → 1128.64] I say that as a preacher
[1131.52 → 1132.40] look at politics
[1132.40 → 1138.88] if you really think about it, I'd rather have a leader who isn't all that good at talking but
[1138.88 → 1141.60] sure knows how to live and make decisions based on that good living
[1143.12 → 1143.92] I'd rather have that
[1145.44 → 1148.96] but to be honest with you, I doubt a leader like that could win an election
[1152.56 → 1153.76] because you have to talk
[1156.88 → 1158.40] look at what Jesus says in Matthew 7
[1158.40 → 1163.20] Jesus says watch out for false prophets people who sound like they're telling you to shoot but
[1163.20 → 1168.32] they're not they come in sheep's clothing they look good, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves
[1168.88 → 1174.24] how do you know that by their fruit you'll recognize them by their lives you'll recognize them
[1176.00 → 1181.60] well what fruit well let's jump to Galatians 5 where Paul right the fruit of the spirit is here's
[1181.60 → 1188.24] what life looks like love joy peace forbearance we're putting up with each other right kindness what
[1188.40 → 1193.76] kindness that that's a thing yeah it is goodness faithfulness gentleness self-control
[1194.48 → 1199.60] and in such there is no law those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh there's that
[1199.60 → 1206.16] death of self with its passions and desires uh you know living for yourself right since we live by the
[1206.16 → 1212.88] spirit we keep in step with the spirit let us not become conceited because that's the alternative
[1212.88 → 1218.40] provoking we'd like to poke things get things going and then being each other
[1221.68 → 1226.96] big words fluent sentences brilliant reasoning all fine I'm not anti-intellectual to don't hear me well
[1226.96 → 1233.92] I'm i i I love a perfect to be I think there 's's value to that but jams is saying that's not
[1233.92 → 1243.12] not necessarily real wisdom that's not necessarily real wisdom look at their lives see if there's some
[1243.12 → 1251.28] sync with their lives here in this Greco-Roman world that jams lives in there were wandering
[1251.28 → 1257.52] teachers who earned their living with quick minds and golden tongues, and they went around
[1257.52 → 1264.72] and debated the rabbis they argued the fine points of the Torah the Hebrew scripture and formed schools
[1264.72 → 1274.72] of interpretation around themselves again none of that's necessarily bad but jams says let him show by
[1274.72 → 1283.44] his good life by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom from god that's the fruit
[1283.44 → 1289.52] well he had a super clever argument great what's his life look like
[1293.12 → 1295.44] false wisdom is filled with selfish ambition
[1298.64 → 1308.32] while true wisdom produces humility and humility acknowledges it's not for me, it's not for me, I'm not
[1308.32 → 1315.44] that's smart that's why scripture says the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom it starts there
[1316.48 → 1321.92] such an emphasis on humility that jams had been no more popular in the first century world than it is
[1321.92 → 1330.88] now humility was seen as a weakness there's this a Greek philosopher Epictetus hope I said right, but he said
[1330.88 → 1338.00] and he put humility on his list of faults to be avoided i i I had this voice in my head of somebody
[1338.00 → 1345.84] nowadays but how can I be an influencer and be humble at the same time I'm an influencer
[1348.56 → 1356.40] yet jams says this false wisdom of self-centredness, and he says it really hard is earthly unspiritual
[1357.20 → 1361.12] and demonic tell us how you really feel jams
[1361.12 → 1368.56] he says it comes from our natural instincts to serve ourselves that's what that's what sin is and
[1368.56 → 1376.80] ultimately it devours the people around us including ourselves true wisdom comes down from heaven, and it's
[1376.80 → 1383.92] and so it's not from you, it comes down from heaven, and it's pure, and it's gentle, and it's considerate and
[1383.92 → 1390.32] it brings peace does that mean we'll never have a big argument no I didn't necessarily say that
[1391.60 → 1397.84] maybe the argument the road to peace but at some point the goal is peace here and harmony
[1397.84 → 1404.24] it's full of mercy, and it's full of good fruit what does the fruit again love joy peace kind forbearance
[1404.24 → 1409.52] kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness self-control it shows up in how you live
[1409.52 → 1417.68] in a world that is so trivialized so divided into camps over all kinds of issues including
[1417.68 → 1425.68] in churches don't you long for that heavenly wisdom to come down and fill us all
[1430.08 → 1434.56] is that automatically going to settle all the issues with nice tidy solutions that we all agree on
[1434.56 → 1442.08] well probably not this side of heaven but at least it will allow us to live together because this
[1442.08 → 1448.40] heavenly wisdom is what we will all be seeking outside our own brilliance
[1452.64 → 1457.60] we'll be seeking the wisdom we won't assume we have cornered the market on it
[1457.60 → 1466.08] it comes from the one who promises shalom for the entire creation the only one who actually delivers it
[1469.68 → 1474.80] we need to use the power of scripture as a mirror we need to keep looking and look at ourselves in
[1474.80 → 1480.08] the light of scripture and at the same time remembering Paul says we see through a mirror dimly we
[1480.08 → 1485.68] don't see particularly clearly even when we're reading scripture so we struggle together with that
[1487.60 → 1498.48] and let's start with ourselves let's start with ourselves where did I start the sermon this is with
[1498.48 → 1508.96] SID watch your mouth SID watch your mouth you're not responsible for all these mouths you're responsible for this one
[1508.96 → 1518.72] and then let's allow the living and abiding sword that god's word and spirit to pierce our defences and
[1518.72 → 1523.84] skewer our delusions and our egos and cut out our envy and selfish ambition
[1527.04 → 1532.96] we're all sinners, and we all fall short of the glory of god, and we all struggle to tame our tongues and our
[1532.96 → 1541.68] our hearts who can control it no man so yes as Luther said with this little bit of flush between our the jaw
[1542.32 → 1550.24] I praise the lord and I mean it I praise the lord and I mean it but also verbally harm others
[1552.40 → 1553.60] I guess I mean that too
[1553.60 → 1558.56] are those things contradictory yeah they are
[1560.80 → 1561.12] yeah
[1563.92 → 1564.88] and I need to repent
[1568.00 → 1570.48] and then with Paul we can say
[1571.36 → 1575.12] Romans 7 I don't understand what I do
[1575.12 → 1585.28] for what I want to do I don't do but what I hate to do and if I do what I don't want to do I agree that
[1585.28 → 1590.64] the law is good as it is no longer i myself who do it, but it is sin living in me
[1592.16 → 1598.96] and I need heavenly power and heavenly wisdom and grace from above, and we are invited to come to the
[1598.96 → 1604.16] word made flesh to Jesus who alone can forgive our sins and who can tame our tongues through the power of
[1604.16 → 1610.08] the Holy Spirit, and so we are with grace we are forgiven and with the power of the Holy Spirit we
[1610.08 → 1614.08] are transformed and the way we live will then change
[1618.32 → 1622.88] the tongue doesn't have to be then the uncontrolled spark setting everything on fire
[1622.88 → 1627.92] no it can be a bit it can be a rudder guided by the Holy Spirit the power of god in us power we
[1627.92 → 1633.68] humbly surrender to on a day-by-day basis knowing it's not from us, it's otherworldly it's from the lord
[1633.68 → 1639.76] himself so we live then with constant and growing self-awareness with constant and growing humility
[1639.76 → 1642.56] with constant repentance because we need it
[1648.08 → 1653.60] trusting god's spirit to shape us into more christ likeness more and more and more and more
[1653.60 → 1662.64] jams points to the tongue but I will include always we communicate social media as well
[1664.32 → 1670.24] how much harm and self-ambition get displayed there what does this passage say about what we post
[1672.08 → 1677.92] how many sparks are there are we sending off that may well start serious fires out of that world
[1677.92 → 1688.08] we are invited by jams to look at our words with them, we bless and with them, we curse
[1689.52 → 1697.28] and we should be saying unbelievable as jams said this should not be but how many of us are stunned
[1697.28 → 1703.92] by that rather we are quite used to it
[1709.44 → 1717.60] so god sent Jesus, and we read in john 1 when we talk about words in john 1 it says the word
[1718.80 → 1725.92] the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us, we have seen his glory the glory of the one and only
[1725.92 → 1731.92] son who comes from the father full of grace and truth exactly what we're looking for
[1734.00 → 1740.00] who has come to restore and to redeem and to renew all things including our broken words
[1741.44 → 1747.52] and then in him somehow our words are used to bring life and more life and more life, and then we live our
[1747.52 → 1765.92] in jams what good is it if you say you have faith that have not words let's display god's words and how we live
[1765.92 → 1771.28] together, together amen let us pray
[1775.04 → 1782.08] father god we come before you lord, and we thank you that you are the one who brings life
[1783.44 → 1789.92] you are the one who brings wisdom and may we seek your life and your wisdom and display that
[1789.92 → 1798.56] with our how we behave and how we talk in every aspect of our lives that people may see you in us and
[1798.56 → 1806.40] through us and how we talk lord may our words be gentle and considerate and and and kind and
[1807.76 → 1813.04] truthful and grace-filled and peacemaking and forgive us when we use words
[1813.04 → 1822.96] words to cause harm and to bring damage to people who are created in your image make us ever mindful lord
[1823.60 → 1830.32] of how we use our tongues and how we in Jesus name amen
