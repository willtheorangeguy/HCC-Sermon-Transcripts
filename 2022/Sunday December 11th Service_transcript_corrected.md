[0.00 → 3.26] I don't know if we have invited our children up to Cornerstone.
[3.38 → 4.74] Someone's pointing upstairs at me.
[4.74 → 8.22] So I'm going to suggest that if you've got children age 3 to grade 3,
[8.36 → 11.72] you can release them to our Cornerstone children's ministry
[11.72 → 13.78] where they can learn their place in the story.
[30.00 → 36.52] Upstairs, I'll just say a word of gratitude for our youth.
[37.40 → 39.46] I remember a youth pastor saying to me years ago
[39.46 → 41.96] that youth are not just the future of the church, but they are the church.
[42.48 → 43.78] And this morning before the service began,
[43.86 → 46.08] two people came up to me and just said how appreciative they are
[46.08 → 48.98] of the ways that our youth are involved in our service and our ministries.
[49.08 → 52.22] And I'm grateful for the way that they are a meaningful part of our life now,
[52.34 → 53.32] not just in the future.
[55.00 → 56.78] If you've been travelling us through Advent,
[56.88 → 59.60] you'll know that we're working our way through Isaiah 9,
[59.60 → 63.52] the prophecy about Jesus in Isaiah, about this coming king.
[63.92 → 66.16] And we've looked at how Christ is our wonderful counsellor,
[66.42 → 67.60] the way in which he's our mighty God.
[67.66 → 70.64] And this morning we're looking at perhaps one of the stranger statements
[70.64 → 73.42] made about Jesus, but that he is our everlasting father.
[73.94 → 75.28] And we're going to open that up together.
[75.90 → 78.20] What I'd like to do this week, though, is just read the whole passage.
[78.48 → 79.92] We haven't done that for a couple of weeks now.
[79.96 → 81.40] We've just had it read in different languages.
[81.56 → 84.12] And I want to read Isaiah, the whole passage, Isaiah 9,
[84.94 → 85.90] starting in verse 2.
[89.60 → 119.60] 
[119.60 → 149.60] 
[149.60 → 151.78] From that time on and forever.
[152.58 → 156.12] The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
[159.76 → 162.06] Well, this week we were sitting around the dinner table
[162.06 → 165.92] and I was telling my children a story that comes to mind every year during Advent,
[166.10 → 167.96] and I'm going to tell it to you this morning.
[169.44 → 172.16] A few years ago now, Adele would have been 5, Levi 7,
[172.28 → 174.24] and we're driving around at Christmastime.
[174.24 → 176.74] And out of nowhere, Adele, sitting in the back of the van,
[176.92 → 178.24] she pipes up and asks,
[178.42 → 180.12] When was God born?
[181.26 → 182.42] And I was intrigued by that question.
[182.50 → 184.80] It wasn't if God was born or why was God born,
[184.86 → 186.00] but when was God born?
[186.18 → 189.26] And before I even answered Adele or had a thought to how to answer,
[189.66 → 190.98] Levi pipes up and Levi says,
[191.06 → 192.96] Adele, God wasn't born.
[193.52 → 194.16] He's God.
[195.34 → 197.10] And then Adele looks at him, and she says,
[197.24 → 200.50] Well, Jesus was born and Jesus is God.
[200.50 → 203.90] And then all three of us collectively had our minds blown
[203.90 → 207.70] because I think Levi was communicating, if I heard him right,
[207.80 → 209.36] that God can't be born.
[209.44 → 209.82] He's God.
[209.90 → 210.38] He's eternal.
[210.52 → 211.00] And Jesus said,
[211.08 → 212.10] Well, Jesus is God.
[212.24 → 213.90] Jesus is eternal, but Jesus was born.
[214.04 → 215.16] So take that.
[215.82 → 218.98] Mic drop and welcome to the mystery of Advent right there.
[219.64 → 222.90] Eternal Jesus taking on flesh in the manger.
[223.22 → 226.04] That is the beautiful mystery we're opening up this morning.
[226.92 → 231.22] And Isaiah is prophetically, profoundly prophesying about this mystery
[231.22 → 232.84] in the ways he speaks of Jesus.
[232.96 → 234.12] And if you were here last week, you'll know.
[234.22 → 237.46] We talked about the way in which Isaiah 9 is an audacious prophecy
[237.46 → 241.22] because it is saying about this coming child, this coming human,
[241.84 → 244.98] things that are only true in the unfolding story of the Bible about the Father,
[245.62 → 247.16] that are only true about the character of God.
[247.24 → 249.42] And Isaiah is saying what is true about God
[249.42 → 251.96] is going to be fully revealed in this child coming,
[251.96 → 254.56] in Bethlehem, in the middle of nowhere,
[254.68 → 257.80] to two parents who are without status and privilege and power.
[258.30 → 259.74] It's an audacious prophecy.
[260.02 → 262.16] And we've looked at how Jesus is our wonderful counsellor,
[262.60 → 263.24] our mighty God.
[263.28 → 265.40] And this morning we're looking at what I think is a stranger phrase,
[265.50 → 268.78] that Jesus will become an everlasting Father.
[269.68 → 271.00] And there are two parts to that you might say.
[271.08 → 274.04] One is the claim that Jesus, this coming King, will be everlasting.
[274.58 → 276.38] And the other one is that the way in which he'll be everlasting
[276.38 → 277.54] is as a Father.
[277.54 → 281.22] If you've got a different translation,
[281.50 → 284.64] the NIV says that this coming child is an everlasting Father.
[284.76 → 287.56] Some translations say he is the eternal Father.
[288.28 → 290.22] And the reason is there's actually different ways
[290.22 → 293.64] that people understand the way in which this passage speaks of Jesus,
[293.78 → 295.64] this coming child, as an everlasting Father.
[295.70 → 296.54] I'm going to give you the three,
[296.84 → 298.20] and I'm going to say what I think about them,
[298.24 → 298.90] and I could be wrong.
[299.56 → 301.86] Number one, the way in which Jesus is described
[301.86 → 303.30] as the everlasting or eternal Father
[303.30 → 305.04] is that he is before time.
[305.04 → 308.30] He existed before he came into flesh in the womb.
[308.76 → 310.30] And that is to say that he was always there
[310.30 → 311.22] and will always be there.
[311.28 → 311.82] He's eternal.
[312.04 → 312.62] He's everlasting.
[313.68 → 316.08] The second, and I think this is probably the most likely,
[316.22 → 318.72] and that is to say Jesus' rule as a King,
[318.80 → 320.92] remember Isaiah is prophesying a coming King
[320.92 → 323.42] who will rule, who will govern the world with peace and justice,
[323.74 → 326.06] that his rule will go on and on forever.
[327.64 → 329.84] The third is, some commentators suggest
[329.84 → 332.62] that Jesus is outside and above time,
[332.62 → 335.90] that he sort of holds time as this cosmic King
[335.90 → 336.96] who is before all things,
[337.10 → 338.44] and he will be after all things,
[338.52 → 340.90] and that time is in his hands as an eternal Father.
[341.50 → 344.30] And I say all three of these have good biblical grounds,
[344.66 → 346.16] there are good arguments to be made about them,
[346.34 → 347.88] and I say to them, yes,
[348.98 → 351.86] Jesus is before the creation of the world,
[351.94 → 353.44] one with the Father and the Spirit.
[353.96 → 357.36] Yes, Jesus is the King who will establish peace and justice,
[357.48 → 359.64] and his rule will outlast all earthly kingdoms
[359.64 → 362.88] and be the one that overcomes and takes the world
[362.88 → 363.86] by peace and justice.
[363.96 → 364.94] We'll talk about that next week.
[365.44 → 366.88] And finally, he is above time.
[367.92 → 369.02] He's the beginning and the end,
[369.06 → 370.18] the Alpha and the Omega.
[370.78 → 371.96] And as one commentator puts it,
[372.02 → 372.88] I quite like this,
[373.12 → 374.62] he wouldn't be much of a God
[374.62 → 377.36] if he wasn't these things, right?
[377.90 → 379.20] Jesus wouldn't be much of a God
[379.20 → 381.06] if he was finite and bound by time,
[381.18 → 383.38] if his rule did not extend forever and ever,
[383.46 → 385.34] and if he wasn't there before the creation of the world,
[385.64 → 386.44] one with the Father.
[386.44 → 387.58] And I hope you see,
[387.72 → 389.12] even in the preaching of this passage,
[389.54 → 390.82] the bigness of Jesus.
[391.70 → 392.92] You know, I think one of my pet peeves,
[392.98 → 394.26] and maybe you share this about Advent,
[394.56 → 396.46] is the way in which this story of Jesus' birth
[396.46 → 397.86] becomes this cute baby story.
[398.24 → 399.36] When you read Isaiah 9,
[399.42 → 401.08] you get this picture of a cosmic king
[401.08 → 403.72] who's coming to rule the world with peace and justice,
[403.78 → 405.06] and I want to say to the believing church,
[405.34 → 406.82] this is our story for Advent.
[409.30 → 409.66] So,
[410.30 → 413.52] one of the things that stands out to me
[413.52 → 415.20] when I think of the externality of Jesus
[415.20 → 418.16] is my first time really studying 1 John.
[418.88 → 420.54] 1 John is one of those little books at the back
[420.54 → 421.70] that very few people read well,
[421.98 → 423.12] but when I first started reading it,
[423.16 → 424.44] I felt like I was able to enter into
[424.44 → 425.88] a little bit of John's experience,
[426.10 → 428.40] and I felt like I was able to feel the weight
[428.40 → 430.12] and the profundity of what he was saying
[430.12 → 432.28] about Jesus as an eternal Father.
[432.46 → 434.40] And this is what 1 John starts with.
[435.76 → 436.16] He says,
[436.16 → 460.04] And I happen to think,
[460.10 → 461.00] this is what was hitting me
[461.00 → 462.34] when I was first studying 1 John,
[462.62 → 463.80] is that there must have been a moment,
[463.80 → 465.94] or at least maybe an unfolding conviction
[465.94 → 466.62] that John had,
[466.70 → 469.00] that the person that he broke bread with,
[469.16 → 469.40] Jesus,
[470.22 → 471.74] the one that he witnessed doing ministry,
[471.84 → 472.64] the one he walked with,
[472.70 → 474.34] the one he just shared life with,
[474.58 → 477.16] that Jesus was there forever.
[478.22 → 479.92] Just let that wash over you.
[480.34 → 481.70] Jesus would have been with John,
[481.82 → 482.80] John getting to know him,
[482.86 → 483.82] his claims of his identity,
[483.90 → 484.88] all of a sudden it must have hit John,
[484.92 → 485.14] and it's like,
[485.68 → 488.90] this man always was.
[490.04 → 492.24] He existed before the cradle.
[492.24 → 494.24] He was there when Isaiah prophesied
[494.82 → 495.46] about a coming king.
[495.54 → 497.46] He was there when David ruled over Israel.
[497.54 → 498.96] He was there when Noah was building the ark.
[499.18 → 500.78] He was there when Abraham was called
[500.78 → 502.96] to be the father of the Israel,
[503.40 → 504.30] of the nation of Israel.
[504.64 → 505.76] He was always there.
[507.02 → 508.40] And John also, you should know,
[508.50 → 509.32] in his gospel account,
[509.42 → 509.90] John 8,
[510.24 → 513.06] talks about Jesus making this same staggering claim
[513.06 → 514.32] about his existence.
[515.26 → 515.92] Let me read it for you.
[515.96 → 517.20] This is John 8, 58.
[518.16 → 519.04] He's in hot water,
[519.30 → 520.64] because he's arguing with religious leaders,
[520.64 → 522.36] making claims about people of old,
[522.42 → 524.10] saying they wish they could have seen him,
[524.36 → 525.50] even though the religious leaders
[525.50 → 526.28] were not as impressed.
[526.42 → 527.28] And he says,
[527.92 → 530.02] your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought
[530.02 → 531.04] of seeing my day.
[531.22 → 531.82] He saw it,
[531.84 → 532.58] and he was glad.
[532.86 → 533.38] They respond,
[533.58 → 535.26] you are not 50 years old,
[535.44 → 536.10] they said to him,
[536.12 → 538.12] and you have seen Abraham?
[539.38 → 540.06] Very truly,
[540.20 → 540.68] I tell you,
[540.72 → 541.26] Jesus answered,
[541.38 → 543.28] before Abraham was,
[543.68 → 545.10] I am.
[546.94 → 548.18] And listen to the response.
[548.18 → 548.66] At this,
[548.80 → 550.36] they picked up stones to stone him.
[551.18 → 551.94] Can you blame them,
[552.04 → 552.36] by the way?
[552.90 → 553.14] I mean,
[553.18 → 554.36] if you were there in this story,
[554.46 → 555.48] and someone says to you,
[555.58 → 555.70] hey,
[555.82 → 556.90] before Abraham was,
[557.06 → 557.52] I am.
[557.56 → 557.76] You're like,
[557.88 → 559.06] this guy's nuts.
[559.90 → 560.86] That's the claim he's making.
[560.96 → 561.06] Like,
[561.12 → 562.20] before Abraham was,
[562.36 → 563.82] I am.
[564.48 → 565.12] If you know John,
[565.18 → 565.90] he's making all these
[565.90 → 566.52] I am statements
[566.52 → 567.26] to help people see
[567.26 → 568.54] that he is one with the Father.
[568.76 → 570.44] He is the fullest revelation of God.
[570.76 → 571.48] And if you want to know
[571.48 → 572.06] what God's like,
[572.10 → 573.38] he's standing right in front of you.
[573.38 → 575.16] And they could not handle Jesus
[575.16 → 577.76] as this one human Jewish man
[577.76 → 578.58] born in Bethlehem,
[578.74 → 580.58] being one with the Father.
[581.08 → 582.42] And the response is to stone him.
[583.90 → 585.54] I often think of C.S. Lewis,
[586.16 → 587.48] who himself came to faith
[587.48 → 588.66] later in his life,
[589.22 → 591.36] some of which we can give thanks
[591.36 → 592.80] to the counsel of J.R. Tolkien
[592.80 → 594.56] and the way that Tolkien counselled him
[594.56 → 595.78] and sort of discipled him
[595.78 → 596.38] into the faith.
[596.84 → 597.38] But C.S. Lewis,
[597.48 → 598.50] in his own wrestling with faith
[598.50 → 600.00] and making sense of who Jesus is,
[600.20 → 600.98] comes to the conclusion
[600.98 → 602.46] that you get three options with Jesus.
[602.46 → 603.88] He gives you three options
[603.88 → 605.08] for how to make sense of him.
[605.20 → 605.70] One is,
[606.02 → 606.80] he is a lunatic.
[607.70 → 608.34] And I do think
[608.34 → 609.06] there are many people
[609.06 → 609.86] in the first century
[609.86 → 610.92] who thought Jesus
[610.92 → 611.94] was a straight-up lunatic.
[612.40 → 612.76] Secondly,
[613.08 → 613.74] he's a liar,
[614.06 → 615.62] making these outrageous claims
[615.62 → 617.26] that he cannot back up with truth.
[617.90 → 618.52] And the third is,
[618.58 → 619.08] he's the Lord.
[619.74 → 621.04] He is everything he claimed to be.
[621.18 → 622.74] He is the incarnate word.
[622.80 → 623.70] He was one with the Father.
[623.96 → 624.68] He's above time
[624.68 → 625.28] and he's the one
[625.28 → 626.50] who's going to rule the world forever.
[627.56 → 628.56] He is, yes, amen.
[628.76 → 629.60] He's either a liar,
[629.72 → 630.26] he's a lunatic,
[630.34 → 630.92] or he's a Lord.
[630.92 → 632.02] And I should add,
[632.02 → 633.84] C.S. Lewis includes in this,
[634.18 → 635.32] you cannot see Jesus
[635.32 → 637.14] just as a religious teacher,
[637.32 → 638.22] a good moral teacher.
[638.74 → 639.42] And the reason is,
[639.44 → 640.12] and that's, by the way,
[640.16 → 641.46] how many people today see Jesus,
[641.72 → 642.32] the reason is,
[642.56 → 644.08] Jesus doesn't give you that option.
[644.68 → 645.42] He makes staggering,
[645.56 → 646.14] outrageous claims
[646.14 → 646.82] about who he is,
[646.86 → 647.80] his relationship with the Father,
[647.90 → 648.60] what he's come to do
[648.60 → 649.36] and establish his kingdom.
[649.62 → 650.68] He doesn't ever say,
[651.02 → 651.62] you can see me
[651.62 → 652.68] just as a religious teacher.
[653.16 → 654.16] I'm either the Lord,
[654.52 → 655.36] or I'm insane,
[655.60 → 656.32] or I'm a liar.
[656.62 → 657.28] Take your pick.
[658.26 → 659.26] And staggeringly,
[659.68 → 660.74] John, who is with Jesus,
[660.74 → 661.04] says,
[661.32 → 662.56] I believe what Isaiah
[662.56 → 663.70] has prophesied about him.
[663.90 → 665.04] He is the mighty God.
[665.12 → 666.16] He is the wonderful counsellor.
[666.40 → 667.74] He is the everlasting Father.
[667.96 → 668.68] He's the one
[668.68 → 669.58] who is with the Father
[669.58 → 670.26] from the beginning,
[670.72 → 671.92] revealing his purposes
[671.92 → 673.04] and his plans
[673.04 → 673.94] and his mission
[673.94 → 675.28] and what he accomplishes
[675.28 → 675.78] ultimately
[675.78 → 677.10] in and through the cross.
[678.06 → 679.52] What a beautiful mystery.
[681.08 → 681.52] But now we get
[681.52 → 682.30] to the second part
[682.30 → 683.46] of this prophetic statement.
[683.86 → 685.20] Not just an everlasting God,
[685.20 → 687.30] he's an everlasting Father.
[688.10 → 689.74] That is such an important statement
[689.74 → 690.20] to make
[690.20 → 690.78] about what Jesus
[690.78 → 691.72] has come to do.
[692.32 → 693.48] He is not just going
[693.48 → 694.62] to rule a people.
[695.06 → 696.08] He's going to operate
[696.08 → 697.32] with paternal care.
[697.88 → 698.98] He's not just interested
[698.98 → 700.16] in having authority.
[700.30 → 701.28] He wants to have authority
[701.28 → 702.78] over children.
[703.70 → 704.46] He relates
[704.46 → 705.44] as a loving,
[705.90 → 707.30] heavenly Father.
[707.48 → 708.80] He rules relationally.
[708.86 → 710.26] And this is a very big deal.
[710.38 → 710.82] We're going to talk
[710.82 → 711.62] about this next week
[711.62 → 712.40] when we look at
[712.40 → 713.04] Prince of Peace.
[713.36 → 714.04] But you need to know
[714.04 → 715.12] that in the ancient Near East,
[715.72 → 716.76] kings of the world.
[716.98 → 717.58] And that's what Jesus
[717.58 → 718.52] has been prophesied
[718.52 → 719.08] as a king.
[719.58 → 720.20] Kings of the world,
[720.32 → 720.72] first,
[720.80 → 721.48] were often worshipped
[721.48 → 722.08] as deities,
[722.70 → 723.52] which if you're interested,
[723.70 → 724.12] sidebar,
[724.50 → 725.18] one of the reasons
[725.18 → 726.32] we see Jesus described
[726.32 → 727.48] as Lord in the New Testament
[727.48 → 729.24] is because it's a slam
[729.24 → 730.06] against the Caesar
[730.06 → 731.00] who's being worshipped
[731.00 → 731.48] as the Lord.
[731.54 → 731.92] And the Christians
[731.92 → 732.48] had the boldness
[732.48 → 732.80] to say,
[733.06 → 734.10] Caesar is not the Lord,
[734.76 → 735.66] Jesus is the Lord.
[737.08 → 737.76] And, you know,
[737.82 → 738.50] kings in that day,
[738.56 → 739.64] they had an iron fist,
[739.70 → 740.52] they ruled with power,
[740.62 → 741.78] they exercised their might,
[741.92 → 742.76] extended their borders.
[743.44 → 743.88] And, you know,
[743.94 → 744.60] Israel at the time
[744.60 → 745.58] of receiving this prophecy
[745.58 → 747.14] is watching Assyria rise
[747.14 → 748.34] and express its power
[748.34 → 749.00] over them.
[749.28 → 749.80] And they're going to see
[749.80 → 750.88] even more as the king,
[751.04 → 751.94] as the Greeks come
[751.94 → 753.38] and then Rome comes,
[753.54 → 754.38] they're going to destroy
[754.38 → 755.18] Israel's land
[755.18 → 755.82] and take over
[755.82 → 756.70] what they have.
[756.72 → 757.22] And they're going to see
[757.22 → 757.96] the iron fist
[757.96 → 758.60] of these kings.
[758.60 → 760.24] And over and against that,
[760.52 → 761.20] Isaiah is saying,
[761.36 → 762.20] the one who's coming
[762.20 → 763.48] in your people,
[764.24 → 765.40] the Messiah that is going
[765.40 → 766.26] to rule over the world,
[766.38 → 767.46] who's coming through
[767.46 → 768.28] David's line,
[768.60 → 769.02] he's going to be
[769.02 → 769.96] a different kind of king.
[770.36 → 771.74] He will not be the iron fist,
[771.80 → 772.48] he will reveal
[772.48 → 773.84] the heart of the Father.
[774.56 → 775.42] He's going to rule differently
[775.42 → 776.06] than all the other
[776.06 → 777.12] worldly kingdoms then
[777.12 → 777.80] and now,
[777.86 → 778.44] I should add.
[778.76 → 779.16] And,
[779.24 → 780.14] this is also important,
[780.54 → 781.24] he's not going to be
[781.24 → 782.28] like the kings before,
[782.42 → 783.46] even within Israel.
[784.22 → 785.40] Saul, David, Solomon,
[785.52 → 786.18] the kings of Israel
[786.18 → 786.72] that they wanted,
[786.72 → 787.90] all failed Israel
[787.90 → 789.08] in a variety of ways,
[789.48 → 790.12] finding themselves
[790.12 → 791.14] tripped up by selfish
[791.14 → 791.60] ambitions,
[791.84 → 792.56] sinful desires
[792.56 → 793.36] that kept them
[793.36 → 794.46] from actually being
[794.46 → 795.52] the king the people needed.
[795.88 → 796.82] And this coming king,
[796.90 → 797.32] says Isaiah,
[797.40 → 799.48] will be an everlasting father.
[800.08 → 801.04] He's going to rule them
[801.04 → 802.08] like a dad.
[802.52 → 803.32] He's going to show them
[803.32 → 804.98] what they really need.
[806.50 → 807.34] And so we ask
[807.34 → 808.36] that basic question
[808.36 → 809.30] that we asked last week,
[809.36 → 809.98] how is it then
[809.98 → 811.12] that Jesus reveals
[811.12 → 813.10] the Father?
[813.96 → 814.14] You know,
[814.18 → 814.92] just to be clear,
[815.52 → 816.02] when I was working
[816.02 → 816.58] on this sermon,
[817.00 → 818.26] I needed to remind myself,
[818.52 → 819.58] Jesus is not the Father.
[820.08 → 821.58] He is one with the Father,
[821.94 → 823.06] and he's going to reveal
[823.06 → 823.54] the Father,
[823.68 → 825.02] but Jesus is not the Father.
[825.14 → 826.04] So just to be clear
[826.04 → 826.72] about the relationship
[826.72 → 827.44] between the Trinity
[827.44 → 828.54] and this passage.
[828.64 → 829.16] But how is it
[829.16 → 830.08] that Jesus reveals
[830.08 → 830.78] the intention,
[831.50 → 832.56] the heart of the Father
[832.56 → 833.30] in his ministry?
[834.70 → 835.10] Remember,
[835.22 → 835.76] what they wanted
[835.76 → 836.32] was a king.
[836.84 → 837.62] They wanted a king
[837.62 → 838.66] who could rise up
[838.66 → 839.54] some military power,
[839.68 → 840.94] stand against the Roman Empire,
[841.08 → 842.24] and establish Israel,
[842.36 → 843.18] and rebuild the temple,
[843.18 → 844.68] so they could have their peace
[844.68 → 845.84] as a people group again.
[845.84 → 846.96] And they had no idea,
[847.30 → 848.12] they really did,
[848.36 → 849.16] have no idea
[849.16 → 851.26] how big and staggering
[851.26 → 852.68] Jesus' real mission was.
[853.00 → 853.72] And they just could not
[853.72 → 854.54] make sense of Jesus,
[854.62 → 855.40] who walked around
[855.40 → 856.46] teaching about the kingdom,
[856.60 → 857.90] talking about forgiving enemies,
[858.46 → 859.06] praying for those
[859.06 → 859.82] who persecute you,
[860.08 → 860.80] giving cloaks
[860.80 → 861.62] and your possessions
[861.62 → 862.40] to those who had need.
[862.72 → 863.66] His agenda seemed
[863.66 → 864.78] so far from the agenda
[864.78 → 865.76] they wanted from him.
[866.74 → 867.68] And what they realized,
[867.72 → 868.24] and what Jesus,
[868.36 → 868.78] I should say,
[868.86 → 869.32] realized,
[869.46 → 870.42] is they didn't just need
[870.42 → 871.22] that kind of king.
[872.12 → 873.06] They needed a father.
[873.06 → 875.70] Israel needed a father.
[876.62 → 877.12] In fact,
[877.62 → 878.48] we all do.
[879.66 → 880.64] There's a lot of literature,
[880.84 → 881.62] I'm not going to get into it
[881.62 → 882.14] all this morning,
[882.52 → 883.38] about the importance
[883.38 → 884.54] of having a father.
[885.18 → 885.84] Literature that we often
[885.84 → 886.70] don't talk much about.
[887.08 → 887.62] The important role
[887.62 → 888.36] a father plays
[888.36 → 889.38] in caring for his kids,
[889.48 → 890.22] protecting his kids,
[890.52 → 891.74] loving his kids,
[892.02 → 893.74] and how pain
[893.74 → 894.98] and so much hurt
[894.98 → 895.40] emerges
[895.40 → 896.50] when there is no father
[896.50 → 897.22] in one's life
[897.22 → 898.20] to care and protect,
[898.32 → 898.64] to nurture,
[898.78 → 899.30] and to love.
[900.08 → 900.84] And someone shared with me
[900.84 → 901.24] in our church
[901.24 → 902.08] not that long ago
[902.08 → 903.34] that there is a staggering
[903.34 → 904.24] number of people
[904.24 → 905.44] who are incarcerated
[905.44 → 906.88] who do not have a father.
[907.60 → 908.26] And how there's a sense
[908.26 → 908.88] in which when one
[908.88 → 910.10] is fatherless,
[910.46 → 911.54] they are lost
[911.54 → 913.06] in a very profound,
[913.34 → 914.02] painful way.
[914.12 → 914.98] And some of us know that.
[915.20 → 916.02] I don't need to talk much
[916.02 → 917.04] about that for some of us.
[917.42 → 918.64] And I need us to realize
[918.64 → 919.66] that Jesus has come
[919.66 → 921.44] because the world
[921.44 → 923.24] has lost their father.
[924.04 → 924.90] There's a real sense
[924.90 → 925.82] in which the world,
[925.96 → 926.86] including our societies
[926.86 → 927.38] and our cities,
[927.76 → 928.98] live estranged
[928.98 → 930.62] from their heavenly father.
[930.62 → 932.68] And Jesus has come
[932.68 → 934.34] to invite the world,
[934.48 → 935.20] you and I included,
[935.46 → 936.64] to live in relationship
[936.64 → 937.96] with our heavenly father again.
[938.08 → 939.70] And he has come to show us
[939.70 → 940.50] what that father's heart
[940.50 → 941.02] looks like.
[942.24 → 943.26] Think of his ministry.
[944.30 → 944.82] One of the things
[944.82 → 945.58] that stands out to me,
[945.62 → 946.50] I could say a lot here
[946.50 → 947.38] about Jesus' ministry
[947.38 → 948.18] and the way it reveals
[948.18 → 948.80] the heart of the father.
[948.86 → 949.40] But one of the things
[949.40 → 950.56] that hits me the most,
[950.64 → 951.00] perhaps,
[951.74 → 953.92] is how relational Jesus is.
[955.04 → 956.64] There is this trite saying,
[956.70 → 957.34] you've probably heard it
[957.34 → 957.96] about Christianity.
[958.14 → 958.34] You know,
[958.34 → 959.96] Christianity is not a religion,
[960.48 → 961.14] it's relationship.
[961.26 → 961.96] Have you heard that before?
[962.72 → 962.88] Yeah?
[963.04 → 963.94] I don't actually love
[963.94 → 964.38] that division.
[964.50 → 964.88] I actually think
[964.88 → 965.52] Christianity actually
[965.52 → 966.12] is a religion,
[966.32 → 967.26] but it is also
[967.26 → 968.60] very much a relationship.
[969.24 → 970.04] But there's something
[970.04 → 970.96] very true about that.
[971.02 → 971.86] There's a difference
[971.86 → 972.66] in the way we think
[972.66 → 973.18] of Christianity,
[973.30 → 973.72] and that is,
[973.80 → 975.66] it is deeply relational.
[976.32 → 977.22] And in Jesus' ministry,
[977.32 → 978.50] he's going from house to house.
[978.82 → 979.74] He's sharing life
[979.74 → 980.58] with these 12 disciples
[980.58 → 981.66] who can't make sense of him,
[981.78 → 983.06] but he wants to be known
[983.06 → 983.76] by them,
[984.28 → 985.02] and he wants them
[985.02 → 986.24] to know him.
[987.12 → 989.22] Christianity is fundamentally relational.
[989.52 → 990.26] And to become a Christian
[990.26 → 992.24] is to enter into relationship.
[992.38 → 993.26] And what Jesus is saying
[993.26 → 994.22] to so many of the people
[994.22 → 995.32] he engages with is,
[995.72 → 996.32] get to know me
[996.32 → 997.24] and you're going to discover
[997.24 → 998.16] the heart of the Father.
[998.52 → 999.22] To know me
[999.22 → 1000.12] is to know the Father.
[1000.22 → 1001.14] To be in relationship with me
[1001.14 → 1002.38] is to discover the beauty,
[1002.66 → 1003.04] the depth,
[1003.10 → 1003.70] and the profundity
[1003.70 → 1005.72] of the Father's love for you,
[1006.56 → 1007.26] your creator,
[1007.88 → 1008.48] your redeemer.
[1009.32 → 1010.06] To know Jesus
[1010.06 → 1011.38] is to be in relationship
[1011.38 → 1012.46] with the Father.
[1012.56 → 1013.62] He has come to reveal
[1013.62 → 1014.56] the Father's love,
[1014.56 → 1016.06] the Father's justice,
[1016.18 → 1016.60] and mercy.
[1017.92 → 1019.16] I think of Jesus' love
[1019.16 → 1020.18] for children, even.
[1020.88 → 1021.82] A story that probably
[1021.82 → 1022.74] doesn't get preached on enough
[1022.74 → 1023.64] is how Jesus is teaching
[1023.64 → 1024.14] about the kingdom.
[1024.84 → 1025.64] There are kids who want
[1025.64 → 1026.10] to be with Jesus.
[1026.24 → 1027.04] And just think about that
[1027.04 → 1027.58] by itself.
[1027.90 → 1029.30] The kids want to be with Jesus.
[1029.74 → 1030.30] Isn't that beautiful?
[1031.02 → 1031.54] He's teaching,
[1031.62 → 1032.28] and there's little children
[1032.28 → 1034.04] who want to go to him,
[1034.28 → 1035.60] and he's not too busy for them.
[1035.64 → 1036.96] He doesn't think that his agenda
[1036.96 → 1037.88] is too packed for them.
[1038.08 → 1038.72] He says to the disciples,
[1038.84 → 1039.32] stop it.
[1039.50 → 1040.50] Let these kids come to me.
[1040.50 → 1041.48] And I imagine,
[1041.58 → 1042.32] this is not in the Bible,
[1042.32 → 1043.82] but I imagine they played with him.
[1044.38 → 1045.30] He laughed with them,
[1045.36 → 1046.70] and he blessed them
[1046.70 → 1048.00] because he's revealing
[1048.00 → 1049.64] a Father's heart for his world.
[1049.76 → 1050.44] And I tell you what,
[1050.60 → 1052.40] a Father loves children,
[1052.88 → 1054.32] actual children.
[1055.50 → 1056.60] That's the Father's heart
[1056.60 → 1057.60] demonstrated in Jesus.
[1058.46 → 1059.10] And beyond that,
[1059.16 → 1060.40] his care for the vulnerable,
[1060.92 → 1062.08] his protection of women
[1062.08 → 1063.08] is staggering.
[1063.78 → 1066.08] And his constant invitation
[1066.08 → 1067.98] for outsiders who do not believe
[1067.98 → 1069.02] they're worthy of mercy,
[1069.18 → 1069.70] of love,
[1069.70 → 1070.48] of generosity,
[1070.96 → 1072.54] of God's heart.
[1072.86 → 1074.36] He invites them into relationship.
[1074.50 → 1075.46] He invites them to follow him.
[1075.50 → 1076.36] He invites them to believe.
[1076.56 → 1078.06] He invites them into fellowship.
[1078.82 → 1080.42] The Father's heart is on full display
[1080.42 → 1082.52] in the life and the ministry
[1082.52 → 1083.24] and the action
[1083.24 → 1084.94] and the healing of Jesus.
[1085.08 → 1085.62] Do you see it?
[1088.26 → 1089.00] But of course,
[1089.08 → 1090.76] there is no better moment
[1090.76 → 1092.84] where Jesus reveals
[1092.84 → 1093.56] the loving,
[1093.92 → 1095.68] self-sacrificing heart of the Father
[1095.68 → 1096.90] than the cross.
[1096.96 → 1097.40] And you'll notice,
[1097.52 → 1097.96] every week,
[1097.96 → 1098.98] we're going from the cradle
[1098.98 → 1099.78] to the cross here.
[1100.28 → 1101.42] When Jesus allows,
[1101.64 → 1102.04] willingly,
[1102.46 → 1103.06] sacrificially,
[1103.22 → 1104.84] for his life to be given up,
[1105.28 → 1106.76] it is the Father's way of saying,
[1107.08 → 1108.62] this is how far I will go
[1108.62 → 1109.46] to bring you
[1109.46 → 1110.94] in relationship with myself.
[1111.72 → 1112.44] And ultimately,
[1112.64 → 1114.12] Jesus is keenly aware,
[1114.54 → 1115.46] especially on his journey
[1115.46 → 1116.18] towards Jerusalem,
[1116.42 → 1117.84] that he has been sent
[1117.84 → 1119.26] by the Father
[1119.26 → 1120.32] to restore
[1120.32 → 1121.66] the world's relationship
[1121.66 → 1123.50] with the one who made them,
[1124.22 → 1125.18] the one who loves them.
[1125.18 → 1126.72] And as Jesus allows
[1126.72 → 1127.44] the nails to go
[1127.44 → 1128.06] through his hands,
[1128.12 → 1128.96] as he allows his body
[1128.96 → 1129.68] to be strung up
[1129.68 → 1130.82] on these two wooden beams,
[1131.10 → 1132.30] it's Jesus' way of saying,
[1132.56 → 1133.76] this is how you will be
[1133.76 → 1135.04] and put in right relationship
[1135.04 → 1135.56] with God.
[1135.86 → 1137.08] This is how your heavenly Father
[1137.08 → 1137.68] is going to deal
[1137.68 → 1138.52] with your rebellion,
[1138.86 → 1139.42] your sin,
[1139.56 → 1140.98] the power that has removed
[1140.98 → 1142.02] and separated you
[1142.02 → 1143.40] from fellowship with him.
[1143.90 → 1144.86] This is how the Father
[1144.86 → 1145.62] will deal with it.
[1148.42 → 1149.86] It's the everlasting Father
[1149.86 → 1150.86] becoming finite.
[1151.86 → 1153.04] It's the eternal word
[1153.04 → 1153.98] taking on flesh
[1153.98 → 1154.88] and then in his flesh
[1154.88 → 1156.18] giving himself up
[1156.18 → 1158.10] so that we may be brought back
[1158.10 → 1159.06] into the family.
[1159.48 → 1160.18] We might become,
[1160.26 → 1161.00] as the Bible says,
[1161.30 → 1163.12] children of God.
[1165.10 → 1166.48] I want to read for us
[1166.48 → 1168.52] a passage that came to my heart
[1168.52 → 1169.62] a few times in this sermon
[1169.62 → 1170.58] and it's actually
[1170.58 → 1171.46] one of my favourite psalms,
[1171.56 → 1171.96] Psalm 103,
[1172.28 → 1173.16] and I want us to read
[1173.16 → 1173.76] these words
[1173.76 → 1174.72] through the lens
[1174.72 → 1175.88] of the cross, okay?
[1177.40 → 1178.68] This is Psalm 103,
[1178.84 → 1179.54] starting in verse 8.
[1179.54 → 1181.06] The Lord is compassionate
[1181.06 → 1182.00] and gracious.
[1183.08 → 1184.30] He is slow to anger
[1184.30 → 1186.12] and abounding in love.
[1186.78 → 1188.12] He will not always accuse,
[1188.26 → 1188.98] nor will he harbour
[1188.98 → 1189.90] his anger forever.
[1190.26 → 1191.48] He does not treat us
[1191.48 → 1192.52] as our sins deserve
[1192.52 → 1194.10] or repay us
[1194.10 → 1195.34] according to our iniquities.
[1195.86 → 1197.58] For as high as the heavens
[1197.58 → 1198.84] are above the earth,
[1199.40 → 1201.58] so great is his love
[1201.58 → 1202.60] for those who fear him.
[1203.14 → 1204.48] As far as the east
[1204.48 → 1205.56] is from the west,
[1206.12 → 1207.54] so far has he removed
[1207.54 → 1208.94] our transgressions from us.
[1208.94 → 1211.12] As a father has compassion
[1211.12 → 1212.18] on his children,
[1213.06 → 1214.68] so the Lord has compassion
[1214.68 → 1216.42] on those who fear him.
[1217.54 → 1218.12] Do you see it
[1218.12 → 1219.06] through the lens of the cross?
[1220.50 → 1221.96] Jesus, or the father's compassion
[1221.96 → 1222.62] goes all the way
[1222.62 → 1223.22] through the cradle
[1223.22 → 1224.24] to the cross.
[1225.00 → 1225.92] And it is ultimately
[1225.92 → 1227.24] that moment of giving
[1227.24 → 1228.54] Jesus' life up
[1228.54 → 1229.86] where we realize
[1229.86 → 1231.44] that he is a compassionate father.
[1232.20 → 1233.50] It's that decisive moment
[1233.50 → 1234.12] of the cross,
[1234.22 → 1235.22] Jesus' death and resurrection,
[1235.38 → 1235.80] where he says,
[1236.06 → 1236.98] I will deal with you
[1236.98 → 1237.52] in this way.
[1237.52 → 1238.52] This is how I'm going
[1238.52 → 1239.70] to get rid of your transgressions.
[1239.94 → 1240.92] This is how I'm not going
[1240.92 → 1241.44] to repay you
[1241.44 → 1242.60] according to what you've done.
[1242.92 → 1244.18] This is my father's heart
[1244.18 → 1246.28] giving Jesus up
[1246.28 → 1247.30] for you.
[1250.38 → 1251.68] And through that event
[1251.68 → 1252.80] of the death and resurrection,
[1253.14 → 1254.54] Jesus invites us
[1254.54 → 1255.62] into the family.
[1256.66 → 1257.22] He invites us
[1257.22 → 1258.08] as estranged,
[1258.98 → 1260.56] rebellious children
[1260.56 → 1262.04] to come home.
[1263.08 → 1263.46] In fact,
[1263.48 → 1264.10] it seems to me
[1264.10 → 1264.76] that the words
[1264.76 → 1265.84] God proclaims
[1265.84 → 1266.66] in and through the cross,
[1266.74 → 1267.08] number one,
[1267.12 → 1267.68] I love you.
[1268.32 → 1269.40] I love you world
[1269.40 → 1270.70] and I love you children.
[1271.10 → 1272.14] I forgive you.
[1273.18 → 1273.86] Come home.
[1275.30 → 1276.06] That's what I see
[1276.06 → 1276.76] in this passage.
[1277.60 → 1278.40] And even more than that,
[1278.48 → 1279.00] marvellously
[1279.00 → 1279.72] and mysteriously,
[1279.90 → 1280.56] this just kind of
[1280.56 → 1281.40] blew my mind this week
[1281.40 → 1282.00] so I'm just going to share
[1282.00 → 1282.48] near the end.
[1282.96 → 1283.68] One of the things
[1283.68 → 1284.64] that Jesus does
[1284.64 → 1286.36] as the everlasting father
[1286.36 → 1288.26] is he invites children
[1288.26 → 1289.44] to share
[1289.44 → 1290.96] in everlasting life.
[1291.62 → 1292.30] Think about that.
[1292.30 → 1293.02] Jesus,
[1293.22 → 1293.78] who is eternal,
[1294.06 → 1295.10] who takes on flesh,
[1295.30 → 1296.24] who defeats sin
[1296.24 → 1297.20] and Satan and death
[1297.20 → 1298.12] by the cross,
[1298.22 → 1298.80] rising up,
[1298.88 → 1299.70] says to everyone
[1299.70 → 1300.32] who believes,
[1300.74 → 1303.40] share in my eternal life.
[1304.14 → 1304.86] Isn't that staggering?
[1305.66 → 1305.96] I mean,
[1306.00 → 1306.60] some of you were here
[1306.60 → 1307.12] on Tuesday.
[1308.06 → 1309.00] We had Robert Livingston
[1309.00 → 1310.04] celebration of life.
[1310.38 → 1310.90] And every time
[1310.90 → 1311.46] I do a funeral,
[1311.64 → 1313.42] I sort of in my own life
[1313.42 → 1314.18] have to grapple
[1314.18 → 1315.20] with the profundity
[1315.20 → 1316.40] of what Jesus is offering.
[1316.90 → 1317.78] When he offers salvation,
[1317.90 → 1319.04] it's not just the resurrection life
[1319.04 → 1320.00] that comes to us now.
[1320.32 → 1321.32] It's the power
[1321.32 → 1322.74] for us to not allow
[1322.74 → 1323.68] the grave be the end
[1323.68 → 1324.26] of our story.
[1324.56 → 1325.34] The comfort that we are
[1325.34 → 1326.68] with Jesus after we die
[1326.68 → 1327.72] and the promise
[1327.72 → 1329.00] that what's true for Jesus
[1329.00 → 1330.14] becomes true for us.
[1330.54 → 1331.64] If Jesus' body rises
[1331.64 → 1332.24] from the dead,
[1332.48 → 1333.76] so does ours
[1333.76 → 1334.90] by faith in Jesus.
[1335.08 → 1336.40] He shares with us
[1336.40 → 1337.80] eternal life.
[1338.96 → 1339.78] I hope the weight
[1339.78 → 1340.30] and the beauty
[1340.30 → 1341.06] and the power of that
[1341.06 → 1342.08] is not lost on us
[1342.08 → 1342.90] as a church today.
[1344.08 → 1344.90] And it seems to me
[1344.90 → 1346.00] that maybe the best verse
[1346.00 → 1347.12] to finish this sermon with
[1347.12 → 1348.84] is the most popular verse
[1348.84 → 1349.50] in the entire Bible.
[1349.50 → 1350.14] You know what that is?
[1351.18 → 1352.10] John 3, 16.
[1352.82 → 1354.98] For God so loved the world
[1354.98 → 1356.40] that he gave his one
[1356.40 → 1357.04] and only son
[1357.04 → 1358.76] that whoever believes in him
[1358.76 → 1360.12] will not perish
[1360.12 → 1364.24] but have everlasting life.
[1364.46 → 1365.20] Made possible
[1365.20 → 1366.94] by our wonderful counsellor,
[1368.20 → 1369.46] our everlasting father,
[1369.72 → 1370.42] our mighty God,
[1370.50 → 1371.64] our prince of peace.
[1372.14 → 1373.16] Would you pray with me?
[1373.16 → 1379.88] Father, we thank you for your word.
[1381.24 → 1382.44] And we pray that you would
[1382.44 → 1383.48] allow us to see
[1383.48 → 1385.28] the significance
[1385.28 → 1387.18] and the hugeness of Jesus.
[1388.58 → 1390.22] We pray that we would marvel
[1390.22 → 1391.58] at what you have done
[1391.58 → 1392.82] in the incarnation,
[1393.52 → 1395.30] that you sent your son
[1395.30 → 1396.34] for your world
[1396.34 → 1397.78] and for us.
[1397.78 → 1399.24] And we pray, Lord,
[1399.28 → 1400.32] we would know how to live
[1400.32 → 1401.00] as your children
[1401.00 → 1402.76] and we would learn
[1402.76 → 1404.02] how to invite others
[1404.02 → 1405.00] into the family.
[1405.96 → 1406.68] Lord, we thank you
[1406.68 → 1407.40] for our salvation.
[1408.26 → 1409.64] We thank you for eternal life.
[1410.24 → 1411.42] We thank you for the finished work
[1411.42 → 1412.50] of Christ on the cross.
[1413.14 → 1413.34] Amen.
[1413.34 → 1416.00] At this time,
[1416.06 → 1416.72] I invite you to stand
[1416.72 → 1417.64] and sing with me our song.
