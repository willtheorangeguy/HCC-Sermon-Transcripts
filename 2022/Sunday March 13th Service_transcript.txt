[0.00 --> 3.94]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[6.40 --> 9.78]  It was actually great when the mic turned off
[9.78 --> 14.44]  because Pastor Kim had so much power behind his prayer and his voice
[14.44 --> 17.00]  that I was blessed a little more without the mic.
[17.66 --> 19.48]  I don't think I want to do that for my sermon,
[20.02 --> 22.28]  but I don't have enough power for that, I don't think.
[22.92 --> 26.70]  And I can also sympathize and relate with Brittany when she teared up
[26.70 --> 28.10]  as she hears your voice.
[28.10 --> 34.26]  And that happened when we were first allowed to gather when I was here
[34.26 --> 37.68]  and as I was leading worship, just to hear real voices.
[38.16 --> 40.58]  Although, albeit it was still masked at that point,
[41.34 --> 44.62]  but just to hear your voices together in gathered worship,
[45.16 --> 48.22]  so I can relate how beautiful that is.
[49.60 --> 50.46]  It's a double blessing.
[51.12 --> 53.62]  So we were blessed at that time when we were able to gather.
[53.62 --> 56.84]  Now, as we can hear your voices louder,
[57.74 --> 64.02]  and as God allows us to gather for worship like this without masks,
[64.56 --> 68.20]  even if you still have it on, everyone goes at their pace.
[69.34 --> 72.84]  But just, I have my mask on all the time,
[73.38 --> 76.80]  and the goal is not to love that mask.
[77.60 --> 79.02]  The people who do wear the mask,
[79.12 --> 81.52]  it's not their goal to have it on for the rest of our lives.
[81.52 --> 83.52]  We want to be there with you.
[84.28 --> 87.48]  But I think showing love and humility is sympathizing
[87.48 --> 89.76]  and understanding where people are at
[89.76 --> 94.06]  and being with them wherever they are,
[94.48 --> 95.96]  whether they're masked or not.
[96.62 --> 99.46]  And so, it was just, yeah, this is not part of the sermon.
[99.62 --> 100.70]  It was beautiful.
[101.06 --> 101.82]  I shared it with Brittany.
[102.56 --> 104.72]  It's great to gather again for worship.
[104.72 --> 107.10]  The government said,
[107.24 --> 108.86]  oh, there's no more capacity limits.
[109.74 --> 111.96]  Ironic, because this morning at 9 a.m.,
[111.96 --> 114.96]  I don't think people cared whether there was a limit or not.
[115.12 --> 116.76]  It was still daylight savings time,
[116.88 --> 118.86]  and so it was hard to get up in the morning.
[119.86 --> 122.38]  Hence, we have a bigger crowd here for the second service.
[122.46 --> 122.86]  Thank you.
[122.86 --> 126.94]  And so, for today,
[127.28 --> 132.28]  I want to invite you to look at what is commonly called
[132.28 --> 135.90]  the Jesus' farewell discourse.
[136.48 --> 139.44]  So, we're talking about John chapters 13 to 19,
[140.14 --> 142.00]  and it is called this because here,
[142.24 --> 143.48]  it is called this here because,
[143.68 --> 144.92]  as Pastor Dave mentioned before,
[145.36 --> 148.32]  the gospel writer John slows things down,
[148.44 --> 149.38]  way, way down,
[149.50 --> 151.34]  to focus on the road to the cross.
[151.34 --> 153.84]  To put it in perspective,
[154.06 --> 156.94]  so the five chapters from chapters 13 to 19
[156.94 --> 160.50]  all take place within one 24-hour day.
[162.20 --> 166.70]  But before we get into chapter 13 for our text today,
[167.22 --> 168.36]  and I'm blaming Dave for this
[168.36 --> 170.48]  because he got us behind in the sermon series,
[170.78 --> 172.34]  we weren't able to look at John 12.
[173.04 --> 174.16]  And so, really briefly,
[174.68 --> 175.20]  take a look at,
[175.60 --> 177.98]  I want to invite you to take a look at John 12.
[178.66 --> 180.36]  And so, picture with me this scene
[180.36 --> 181.36]  in the gospel narrative.
[181.48 --> 182.76]  So, we're at John 12 right now.
[183.08 --> 184.60]  Where the gospel narrative is,
[185.26 --> 186.96]  and where the scale is getting bigger
[186.96 --> 189.26]  is what I want to communicate.
[190.00 --> 191.28]  The tension is building.
[192.46 --> 194.86]  The tension between Jesus and the Jewish people,
[194.96 --> 196.58]  the Jewish leaders, are rising.
[197.30 --> 200.94]  And this is exactly when Jesus enters Jerusalem,
[201.34 --> 202.88]  riding on a donkey, you remember,
[202.88 --> 205.10]  with a great crowd shouting,
[205.68 --> 206.12]  Hosanna!
[207.08 --> 208.08]  Blessed is he!
[208.62 --> 211.16]  Blessed is the King of Israel!
[212.84 --> 215.08]  And so, as this tension grows,
[215.34 --> 218.14]  and as Jesus prepares for the final stage
[218.14 --> 219.54]  of his ministry on the cross,
[219.70 --> 222.60]  he turns his focus to his disciples,
[223.00 --> 224.20]  to his own.
[224.20 --> 227.74]  And so, Jesus is turning directly at us,
[228.36 --> 230.62]  asking this question,
[231.06 --> 233.38]  Do you receive my love?
[235.80 --> 237.72]  So, I want to invite you to witness
[237.72 --> 240.30]  the double aspect of the gospel message
[240.30 --> 241.38]  from our text this morning.
[242.14 --> 244.42]  The indicative and the imperative.
[245.18 --> 246.26]  So, let me explain.
[246.36 --> 247.78]  The indicative and the imperative.
[248.42 --> 250.26]  This text of John's account
[250.26 --> 251.60]  of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[251.60 --> 253.04]  wants to tell us,
[253.32 --> 254.74]  wants to show us
[254.74 --> 259.32]  our identity as receivers of Christ's love.
[259.96 --> 261.02]  Our identity.
[261.44 --> 262.48]  That's the indicative.
[263.36 --> 266.04]  And our mission in Christ
[266.04 --> 268.82]  to overflow that love onto others,
[269.00 --> 270.18]  which is the imperative.
[271.30 --> 272.94]  And I said this in the first service.
[273.04 --> 275.98]  I understand that overflow is not a verb.
[276.06 --> 277.62]  I can't use it like this in this sentence.
[278.08 --> 278.62]  But it's just,
[278.86 --> 280.66]  that image I want to communicate
[280.66 --> 281.46]  and get across
[281.46 --> 283.86]  is that overflowing of God's love.
[285.10 --> 286.40]  And so, our identity
[286.40 --> 288.54]  as receivers, first and foremost,
[289.06 --> 291.36]  and as overflowing
[291.36 --> 293.52]  God's love onto others.
[294.52 --> 296.24]  And so, if you have your Bibles with you
[296.24 --> 296.92]  or your app,
[297.52 --> 299.68]  please turn with me to John 13
[299.68 --> 300.96]  as we continue
[300.96 --> 303.52]  witnessing to his gospel.
[305.30 --> 307.02]  We're at John 13.
[307.02 --> 312.20]  Now, it was just before Passover festival.
[313.16 --> 314.72]  Jesus knew that the hour had come
[314.72 --> 316.00]  for him to leave this world
[316.00 --> 316.94]  and go to the Father.
[317.90 --> 319.24]  Having loved his own
[319.24 --> 320.32]  who were in the world,
[320.68 --> 322.18]  he loved them to the end.
[323.30 --> 325.14]  The evening meal was in progress
[325.14 --> 327.24]  and the devil had already prompted
[327.24 --> 329.04]  Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot,
[329.14 --> 330.56]  to betray Jesus.
[331.86 --> 332.98]  Jesus knew that the Father
[332.98 --> 335.38]  had put all things under his power
[335.38 --> 337.36]  and that he had come from God
[337.36 --> 338.72]  and was returning to God.
[339.58 --> 341.74]  So, he got up from the meal,
[342.08 --> 343.32]  took off his outer clothing
[343.32 --> 345.18]  and wrapped the towel around his waist.
[346.06 --> 347.58]  After that, he poured a water
[347.58 --> 348.34]  into a basin
[348.34 --> 350.68]  and began to wash his disciples' feet,
[351.06 --> 352.38]  drying them with the towel
[352.38 --> 353.46]  that was wrapped around him.
[354.40 --> 355.50]  Then he came to Simon Peter
[355.50 --> 356.22]  who said to him,
[356.44 --> 358.36]  Lord, are you going to wash my feet?
[359.30 --> 360.32]  Jesus replied,
[360.72 --> 362.00]  you do not realize now
[362.00 --> 362.70]  what I am doing,
[362.70 --> 364.18]  but later you will understand.
[365.38 --> 366.42]  No, said Peter,
[366.58 --> 367.98]  you shall never wash my feet.
[369.28 --> 370.20]  Jesus answered,
[370.94 --> 372.10]  unless I wash you,
[372.38 --> 374.00]  you have no part with me.
[375.20 --> 376.64]  Then Lord, Simon Peter replied,
[377.02 --> 377.92]  not just my feet,
[378.18 --> 380.00]  but my hands and my head as well.
[381.44 --> 382.24]  Jesus answered,
[382.64 --> 384.10]  those who have had a bath
[384.10 --> 385.92]  need only to wash their feet,
[386.22 --> 387.42]  their whole body is clean,
[387.90 --> 388.88]  and you are clean,
[389.18 --> 390.46]  though not every one of you.
[390.46 --> 394.42]  For Jesus knew who was going to betray him,
[394.70 --> 396.06]  and that was why he said
[396.06 --> 397.30]  not everyone was clean.
[398.58 --> 400.42]  When he had finished washing their feet,
[400.54 --> 401.62]  he put on his clothes
[401.62 --> 403.16]  and returned to his place.
[404.00 --> 405.26]  Do you understand
[405.26 --> 406.38]  what I have done for you?
[406.64 --> 408.24]  He asked his disciples.
[409.08 --> 411.20]  You call me teacher and Lord,
[411.54 --> 412.32]  and rightly so,
[412.58 --> 413.50]  for that is what I am.
[414.36 --> 415.42]  Now that I,
[415.64 --> 416.38]  your Lord and teacher,
[416.50 --> 417.40]  have washed your feet,
[417.62 --> 419.20]  you also should wash
[419.20 --> 420.20]  one another's feet.
[421.26 --> 422.78]  I have set you an example
[422.78 --> 423.54]  that you should do
[423.54 --> 424.76]  as I have done for you.
[425.32 --> 426.80]  Very truly I tell you,
[427.10 --> 428.06]  no servant
[428.06 --> 430.04]  is greater than his master,
[430.44 --> 431.86]  nor is a messenger
[431.86 --> 433.28]  greater than the one
[433.28 --> 433.90]  who sent him.
[434.86 --> 435.88]  Now that you know
[435.88 --> 436.66]  these things,
[437.06 --> 438.46]  you will be blessed
[438.46 --> 439.76]  if you do them.
[441.04 --> 441.48]  Amen.
[441.48 --> 441.58]  Amen.
[442.94 --> 444.16]  You will be blessed.
[444.16 --> 449.54]  Now verses 1 to 3
[449.54 --> 450.32]  in this chapter
[450.32 --> 451.62]  sets the stage
[451.62 --> 453.70]  for the whole foot-washing scene,
[454.18 --> 454.94]  and I suggest,
[455.16 --> 456.30]  along with many scholars,
[456.88 --> 458.86]  that it also sets the stage
[458.86 --> 460.66]  for the whole gospel narrative.
[462.08 --> 463.60]  Jesus' act of washing
[463.60 --> 464.86]  his disciples' feet
[464.86 --> 466.76]  foreshadows the cross
[466.76 --> 468.64]  and the washing away
[468.64 --> 469.46]  of our sins.
[469.46 --> 472.60]  So both the foot-washing
[472.60 --> 473.90]  and the work of the cross
[473.90 --> 475.78]  represent God's
[475.78 --> 477.20]  eternal love for us.
[477.80 --> 478.26]  And thus,
[478.58 --> 480.20]  verse 1 in our passage today
[480.20 --> 481.06]  says that Jesus,
[481.64 --> 483.02]  knowing his time had come,
[483.38 --> 484.68]  having loved his own
[484.68 --> 485.68]  who were in the world,
[486.68 --> 488.32]  he loved them to the end.
[489.82 --> 491.18]  And this last part,
[491.34 --> 492.24]  love them to the end,
[492.66 --> 493.90]  also has a connotation
[493.90 --> 494.40]  in the Greek
[494.40 --> 495.40]  to be rendered as
[495.40 --> 496.72]  he loved them
[496.72 --> 498.32]  most perfectly,
[498.64 --> 500.02]  or he loved them
[500.02 --> 502.58]  uttermostly.
[504.34 --> 505.82]  And so we sang the song
[505.82 --> 506.38]  last week,
[506.46 --> 507.26]  Is He Worthy?
[507.94 --> 508.92]  And before Dave
[508.92 --> 509.80]  did his blessing,
[510.10 --> 510.68]  he emphasized
[510.68 --> 512.54]  and he told us
[512.54 --> 513.88]  how he loved that one verse
[513.88 --> 514.54]  where it says,
[514.92 --> 515.74]  And does Jesus,
[515.90 --> 516.62]  our Messiah,
[517.26 --> 518.42]  hold forever
[518.42 --> 519.88]  those he loves?
[521.08 --> 521.94]  He does.
[522.58 --> 523.62]  And that's the song.
[523.62 --> 527.46]  And so hear the good news
[527.46 --> 528.28]  this morning, Hope.
[529.24 --> 531.94]  God loves His own forever.
[533.74 --> 535.00]  And however we
[535.00 --> 537.14]  may falter away from Him,
[538.36 --> 540.64]  however we may reject
[540.64 --> 542.60]  and try to reject His love,
[542.98 --> 544.78]  He does not stop loving us.
[546.06 --> 546.98]  The importance
[546.98 --> 549.06]  that our passage today signifies
[549.06 --> 550.66]  for us today
[550.66 --> 552.64]  is that we need to receive
[552.64 --> 553.46]  this love.
[554.98 --> 555.92]  And so be reminded
[555.92 --> 556.82]  of our identity.
[557.44 --> 558.36]  This is the indicative
[558.36 --> 559.36]  that I was talking about.
[559.68 --> 561.10]  We are loved by God
[561.10 --> 562.44]  and we are loved
[562.44 --> 564.12]  by Him forever.
[566.92 --> 568.06]  And so going back
[568.06 --> 568.58]  to the beginning
[568.58 --> 569.22]  of verse 1,
[569.72 --> 570.80]  John tells us that
[570.80 --> 572.12]  it's just before
[572.12 --> 573.68]  the Passover festival.
[574.74 --> 576.22]  This is so significant
[576.22 --> 577.84]  that it is during
[577.84 --> 578.82]  the Old Testament
[578.82 --> 579.86]  Jewish festival
[579.86 --> 580.82]  of Passover.
[580.82 --> 580.90]  Passover.
[581.94 --> 583.26]  I'm sure most of you
[583.26 --> 584.44]  know all the details here,
[584.76 --> 585.92]  but just as a reminder,
[586.76 --> 587.94]  this is the festival
[587.94 --> 589.14]  which celebrated
[589.14 --> 590.52]  to remind the people
[590.52 --> 591.14]  of God
[591.14 --> 592.70]  of God's deliverance
[592.70 --> 593.80]  and salvation
[593.80 --> 595.46]  from slavery
[595.46 --> 597.12]  when they were in Egypt.
[598.10 --> 599.18]  Now Jesus,
[600.18 --> 601.30]  on the Passover,
[601.84 --> 602.62]  is getting ready
[602.62 --> 603.90]  to save
[603.90 --> 604.80]  His people
[604.80 --> 605.42]  from slavery
[605.42 --> 606.12]  to sin.
[606.12 --> 609.82]  Jesus is accomplishing
[609.82 --> 610.48]  and fulfilling
[610.48 --> 611.38]  the Old Covenant
[611.38 --> 612.96]  as the long-awaited
[612.96 --> 614.46]  and promised Messiah,
[614.62 --> 615.18]  the Christ.
[615.90 --> 617.14]  And so He is
[617.14 --> 619.02]  God's redemptive mission.
[621.40 --> 623.08]  And as we witness
[623.08 --> 624.66]  Jesus fulfilling
[624.66 --> 626.28]  this promise,
[626.46 --> 627.64]  God's redemptive mission,
[628.06 --> 629.78]  it is very important here
[629.78 --> 630.44]  to highlight
[630.44 --> 631.34]  in verse 3
[631.34 --> 633.28]  the sovereignty of God.
[633.28 --> 635.72]  In verse 3,
[635.80 --> 636.26]  it says that
[636.26 --> 637.10]  Jesus knew
[637.10 --> 637.80]  that the Father
[637.80 --> 639.70]  had put all things
[639.70 --> 640.96]  under His power
[640.96 --> 642.82]  and that He had come
[642.82 --> 643.26]  from Him
[643.26 --> 644.60]  and He was returning
[644.60 --> 645.10]  to God.
[647.68 --> 648.66]  We can say
[648.66 --> 649.32]  with confidence
[649.32 --> 650.08]  from this
[650.08 --> 651.44]  that everything
[651.44 --> 652.54]  is under God's
[652.54 --> 653.66]  care and sustenance.
[655.12 --> 656.48]  God is in control
[656.48 --> 657.10]  against sin,
[658.02 --> 658.88]  having planned it
[658.88 --> 659.44]  so that
[659.44 --> 660.74]  when His time
[660.74 --> 661.34]  had come,
[661.34 --> 662.80]  in the fullness
[662.80 --> 663.48]  of time,
[663.82 --> 664.74]  Jesus got ready
[664.74 --> 665.66]  to accomplish
[665.66 --> 666.86]  God's sovereignty
[666.86 --> 668.52]  over against sin.
[670.16 --> 671.50]  And so we can say
[671.50 --> 672.86]  even in the darkest
[672.86 --> 673.62]  of times,
[674.90 --> 675.76]  even in the midst
[675.76 --> 676.70]  of the sufferings
[676.70 --> 677.50]  and devastation
[677.50 --> 678.18]  that is happening
[678.18 --> 678.84]  in the Ukraine,
[679.56 --> 681.04]  we can still say
[681.04 --> 682.98]  God is in control.
[683.98 --> 685.06]  It is still
[685.06 --> 686.00]  in God's care.
[689.26 --> 690.64]  And the good news
[690.64 --> 692.12]  is that this
[692.12 --> 693.06]  sovereign God
[693.06 --> 693.88]  is loving.
[696.88 --> 697.88]  His loving,
[698.08 --> 698.84]  redemptive mission
[698.84 --> 699.56]  is accomplished
[699.56 --> 700.72]  by Jesus' work
[700.72 --> 701.38]  on the cross.
[702.38 --> 703.90]  By His own death
[703.90 --> 704.60]  and resurrection,
[705.02 --> 705.68]  He defeats
[705.68 --> 706.78]  the powers of sin
[706.78 --> 707.26]  and death
[707.26 --> 708.48]  once and for all.
[709.14 --> 710.48]  He is accomplishing
[710.48 --> 711.14]  God's mission
[711.14 --> 712.32]  and fully establishing
[712.32 --> 713.72]  God's kingdom
[713.72 --> 714.98]  here on earth
[714.98 --> 715.86]  in new creation.
[716.22 --> 716.84]  And that
[716.84 --> 718.42]  is now in-breaking
[718.42 --> 720.18]  and it is inaugurated
[720.18 --> 721.42]  into the present
[721.42 --> 722.32]  through Jesus.
[723.10 --> 724.54]  The full work
[724.54 --> 725.40]  of God's kingdom,
[725.74 --> 726.96]  of God's redemptive
[726.96 --> 727.72]  mission
[727.72 --> 729.72]  is broken into
[729.72 --> 730.36]  through the work
[730.36 --> 730.86]  of the cross
[730.86 --> 731.94]  into the present.
[733.90 --> 735.26]  And so it is no wonder
[735.26 --> 736.00]  Jesus says
[736.00 --> 737.02]  those three significant
[737.02 --> 738.48]  words on the cross.
[739.06 --> 740.54]  It is finished.
[741.80 --> 743.12]  Jesus does not say
[743.12 --> 744.38]  it will be finished
[744.38 --> 746.66]  or it is somewhat finished
[746.66 --> 747.80]  because I started it.
[748.78 --> 749.56]  He says,
[749.70 --> 750.58]  actually it's one word
[750.58 --> 751.00]  in Greek,
[751.30 --> 752.12]  tetelestai.
[752.32 --> 753.68]  It is finished.
[753.96 --> 755.00]  It is a proclamation
[755.00 --> 756.30]  that His kingdom
[756.30 --> 757.54]  has now fully come.
[757.92 --> 759.12]  It is broken into.
[762.00 --> 763.48]  What I have said so far
[763.48 --> 765.10]  is a reflection
[765.10 --> 766.32]  that we get
[766.32 --> 767.58]  from the first three verses
[767.58 --> 768.78]  of our chapter today.
[769.22 --> 770.48]  In these three verses,
[770.64 --> 772.16]  the whole gospel narrative
[772.16 --> 773.80]  of God's redemptive plan
[773.80 --> 775.34]  is included.
[776.78 --> 778.12]  And from these three verses,
[778.46 --> 779.90]  after showing us,
[780.00 --> 780.80]  explaining to us
[780.80 --> 781.96]  God's full mission,
[782.46 --> 783.66]  what's the first thing
[783.66 --> 784.72]  that Jesus does here?
[786.00 --> 787.80]  He turns to His disciples
[787.80 --> 788.42]  and says,
[788.78 --> 790.02]  and prepares
[790.02 --> 792.06]  to wash their feet.
[792.76 --> 794.02]  That's the first thing
[794.02 --> 794.44]  He does.
[796.74 --> 798.16]  Now, there is so much
[798.16 --> 798.74]  to unpack
[798.74 --> 799.74]  with the washing of feet.
[800.36 --> 801.34]  But suffice it to say,
[801.34 --> 802.96]  the two main aspects
[802.96 --> 804.86]  to focus on this morning again
[804.86 --> 806.86]  are our identity
[806.86 --> 808.74]  as receivers of God's love
[808.74 --> 811.54]  and our mission
[811.54 --> 813.30]  to overflow that love
[813.30 --> 813.94]  onto others.
[815.98 --> 817.48]  And so the first one
[817.48 --> 818.20]  is our identity.
[819.42 --> 820.86]  The identity that we have
[820.86 --> 822.54]  is that we are loved by God.
[823.06 --> 824.26]  And most importantly,
[824.74 --> 827.26]  we receive God's humble love
[827.26 --> 828.82]  enacted in the foot washing,
[828.82 --> 830.32]  which also points
[830.32 --> 830.84]  to the love
[830.84 --> 831.94]  enacted through the cross.
[833.14 --> 834.08]  A teacher
[834.08 --> 835.26]  or master
[835.26 --> 836.40]  washing his own
[836.40 --> 837.34]  disciples' feet
[837.34 --> 839.64]  was unthinkable
[839.64 --> 840.96]  in this cultural context.
[842.24 --> 843.60]  That act of love,
[843.70 --> 844.78]  that humble love.
[846.86 --> 847.90]  Now, coming from
[847.90 --> 849.30]  an honor-shame culture myself,
[849.94 --> 851.74]  I can relate to this well
[851.74 --> 852.70]  because my culture
[852.70 --> 853.42]  actually demands
[853.42 --> 854.26]  that I do not even
[854.26 --> 855.08]  show my back
[855.08 --> 856.32]  to my elders
[856.32 --> 857.16]  or superior,
[857.84 --> 859.10]  let alone have that elder
[859.10 --> 859.90]  wash my feet.
[860.34 --> 860.98]  So I don't know
[860.98 --> 861.54]  if you've noticed,
[861.70 --> 862.40]  but some of the
[862.40 --> 863.28]  Asian families
[863.28 --> 864.94]  that are here,
[865.18 --> 866.30]  if you see them
[866.30 --> 867.56]  saying goodbye
[867.56 --> 868.10]  to each other,
[868.20 --> 869.18]  so when we're going home
[869.18 --> 870.08]  after service,
[870.20 --> 870.94]  we're going home,
[871.20 --> 871.70]  and let's say
[871.70 --> 872.34]  somebody older
[872.34 --> 873.58]  or my superior
[873.58 --> 874.46]  or an elder
[874.46 --> 875.86]  goes to his car,
[876.12 --> 877.16]  I wave him goodbye,
[877.64 --> 878.34]  but I don't just go,
[878.72 --> 878.94]  goodbye,
[879.08 --> 879.64]  have a good day,
[879.64 --> 881.32]  and then get into my car.
[881.70 --> 882.10]  It is,
[882.22 --> 882.96]  it has to be,
[883.42 --> 884.00]  alright, goodbye,
[884.18 --> 884.50]  bye,
[884.62 --> 885.18]  네, 가세요,
[885.38 --> 885.98]  네, bye,
[886.10 --> 886.56]  okay, go,
[886.64 --> 887.18]  hurry up, go,
[887.48 --> 888.74]  I can't turn my back on you,
[888.80 --> 889.62]  go, get in your car,
[890.16 --> 890.42]  right?
[892.10 --> 893.32]  I didn't even notice
[893.32 --> 894.30]  that I was doing this,
[894.36 --> 894.88]  but then Moon,
[895.04 --> 895.78]  my wife Moon,
[895.86 --> 896.28]  she's like,
[896.34 --> 896.92]  yeah, that's,
[897.06 --> 898.18]  you can relate to this here.
[898.82 --> 899.66]  Remember how you don't
[899.66 --> 900.36]  turn your back.
[901.18 --> 902.40]  So it's just embedded in me.
[902.74 --> 904.40]  It wasn't intellectually here,
[904.66 --> 905.18]  it was just,
[905.28 --> 906.66]  oh, this is how I live.
[906.66 --> 909.24]  So when somebody older than me goes,
[909.40 --> 910.34]  I don't turn my back
[910.34 --> 911.06]  until they leave.
[912.70 --> 915.18]  And to have this embedded in me
[915.18 --> 916.42]  and to have that elder
[916.42 --> 917.08]  or superior
[917.08 --> 918.80]  come and wash my dirty feet
[918.80 --> 920.62]  is just unthinkable.
[921.72 --> 922.54]  Too intimate.
[923.94 --> 924.92]  And I think,
[925.02 --> 926.86]  I'm speaking more to myself here.
[927.48 --> 928.96]  This explains a part of the reason
[928.96 --> 930.72]  why so many Korean Christians,
[931.28 --> 931.96]  maybe it's similar
[931.96 --> 933.04]  in other cultures as well,
[933.36 --> 934.30]  are so quick
[934.30 --> 936.02]  to want to do something
[936.02 --> 936.96]  when they join the church
[936.96 --> 937.98]  instead of receiving.
[939.84 --> 941.48]  Now you have to hear this clearly.
[941.62 --> 942.58]  I have nothing
[942.58 --> 944.70]  against serving the church
[944.70 --> 945.34]  with the gifts
[945.34 --> 946.96]  that God has gifted us with.
[948.66 --> 949.72]  But serving
[949.72 --> 951.30]  without knowing the why
[951.30 --> 952.44]  can be harmful.
[952.98 --> 954.10]  It is harmful.
[956.18 --> 958.04]  Another commentator says this
[958.04 --> 959.26]  about the foot washing in John.
[959.84 --> 960.94]  He captures this well.
[961.50 --> 961.94]  He says,
[962.26 --> 962.94]  too often,
[962.94 --> 965.04]  a moralistic theology
[965.04 --> 966.64]  has seen only
[966.64 --> 967.80]  an ethical meaning
[967.80 --> 968.96]  in Jesus' foot washing
[968.96 --> 970.06]  and so
[970.06 --> 971.90]  has lost the power
[971.90 --> 972.84]  and center
[972.84 --> 973.76]  of our text,
[974.14 --> 974.70]  which is
[974.70 --> 976.66]  Jesus' love for us.
[980.88 --> 982.84]  This is like the disciple Peter
[982.84 --> 983.88]  in our passage today.
[985.28 --> 985.56]  You see,
[985.68 --> 987.52]  Peter also doesn't understand
[987.52 --> 988.32]  that unless he
[988.32 --> 990.72]  receives God's love,
[991.08 --> 992.58]  he has no part with Jesus.
[992.58 --> 992.72]  Jesus.
[994.72 --> 995.62]  And so,
[995.94 --> 996.96]  as we can relate,
[997.98 --> 998.80]  instead of receiving,
[998.96 --> 999.62]  we are sometimes
[999.62 --> 1000.42]  so focused
[1000.42 --> 1001.36]  on doing
[1001.36 --> 1002.76]  and forget the why
[1002.76 --> 1003.92]  behind what we do.
[1006.08 --> 1007.26]  In my last sermon
[1007.26 --> 1008.38]  a few weeks back,
[1008.90 --> 1010.22]  I shared about
[1010.22 --> 1011.02]  how I had
[1011.02 --> 1012.38]  my conversion experience
[1012.38 --> 1013.96]  when I stopped
[1013.96 --> 1014.72]  being religious.
[1014.72 --> 1017.76]  I grew up in the church,
[1018.42 --> 1019.54]  but until I truly
[1019.54 --> 1020.46]  received
[1020.46 --> 1021.78]  the good news
[1021.78 --> 1022.92]  that God loves me
[1022.92 --> 1024.70]  with unconditional love,
[1025.70 --> 1027.32]  until that happened,
[1027.48 --> 1029.30]  I did not truly believe,
[1029.56 --> 1029.80]  meaning,
[1030.08 --> 1031.08]  I did not truly
[1031.08 --> 1032.44]  entrust my whole life
[1032.44 --> 1033.44]  to this God.
[1035.94 --> 1037.28]  All I did was
[1037.28 --> 1038.72]  do all the imperatives
[1039.34 --> 1041.36]  of what this Christian religion
[1041.36 --> 1042.56]  demanded of me
[1042.56 --> 1043.56]  as a pastor's kid.
[1045.44 --> 1046.18]  And so,
[1046.28 --> 1047.38]  it is so crucial
[1047.38 --> 1048.32]  and significant
[1048.32 --> 1050.00]  that we do not forget
[1050.00 --> 1051.36]  and neglect our identity
[1051.36 --> 1052.52]  first and foremost
[1052.52 --> 1053.74]  as receivers
[1053.74 --> 1054.96]  of God's love.
[1054.96 --> 1057.88]  that has to come
[1057.88 --> 1059.14]  before we can be
[1059.14 --> 1059.60]  a blessing
[1059.60 --> 1060.42]  that overflows
[1060.42 --> 1061.20]  onto others.
[1064.22 --> 1064.86]  And so,
[1064.98 --> 1065.64]  may these words
[1065.64 --> 1066.16]  of the gospel
[1066.16 --> 1067.54]  really be good news
[1067.54 --> 1068.46]  for you today, Hope.
[1069.10 --> 1070.28]  We are loved
[1070.28 --> 1071.10]  beyond measure.
[1072.24 --> 1073.10]  And the foot washing
[1073.10 --> 1074.32]  and our forgiveness
[1074.32 --> 1075.08]  of sin
[1075.08 --> 1077.24]  that is God's love
[1077.24 --> 1078.52]  enacted toward us
[1078.52 --> 1080.08]  is God's
[1080.08 --> 1081.18]  downward grace
[1081.18 --> 1081.74]  to us.
[1081.74 --> 1085.08]  It is God's
[1085.08 --> 1086.06]  downward grace
[1086.06 --> 1086.56]  to us.
[1086.70 --> 1086.90]  And so,
[1086.96 --> 1087.80]  I used this imagery
[1087.80 --> 1088.66]  in the first service
[1088.66 --> 1090.40]  of how we are sinners.
[1090.90 --> 1091.94]  We are like broken,
[1092.90 --> 1094.26]  we are like a broken bowl.
[1095.20 --> 1096.58]  I know Sid used this before
[1096.58 --> 1097.44]  when he was talking
[1097.44 --> 1098.08]  about serving
[1098.08 --> 1099.04]  as a church together
[1099.04 --> 1100.42]  and how we are all sinners,
[1100.82 --> 1102.12]  broken pieces put together
[1102.12 --> 1103.54]  in a Japanese art form
[1103.54 --> 1104.52]  that he used as an image.
[1105.42 --> 1106.40]  I want to steal that
[1106.40 --> 1106.92]  a little bit,
[1107.12 --> 1107.86]  but I want to talk about
[1107.86 --> 1108.60]  like ourselves
[1108.60 --> 1109.42]  as individuals,
[1109.68 --> 1110.80]  as sinners as well,
[1110.80 --> 1112.02]  who are all broken,
[1112.38 --> 1113.42]  but by God's
[1113.42 --> 1114.36]  downward grace,
[1114.70 --> 1116.10]  he puts us back together
[1116.10 --> 1117.38]  as a bowl.
[1117.98 --> 1118.62]  And imagine
[1118.62 --> 1119.94]  and think of God's love
[1119.94 --> 1120.66]  and his grace
[1120.66 --> 1121.88]  as water that flows
[1121.88 --> 1122.88]  down onto us
[1122.88 --> 1124.50]  and it fills this bowl.
[1126.28 --> 1128.00]  But the important part here,
[1128.60 --> 1129.54]  the two aspects
[1129.54 --> 1130.52]  that I want to get across
[1130.52 --> 1131.04]  this morning
[1131.04 --> 1132.62]  are that identity
[1132.62 --> 1133.42]  as receivers
[1133.42 --> 1134.18]  of that love,
[1134.50 --> 1136.06]  but also that mission
[1136.06 --> 1137.62]  of how God's love
[1137.62 --> 1138.34]  is poured out
[1138.34 --> 1139.28]  and it doesn't stop
[1139.28 --> 1139.96]  when it's full,
[1139.96 --> 1141.36]  it keeps flowing.
[1142.00 --> 1142.34]  So,
[1142.50 --> 1143.44]  what I'm trying to say
[1143.44 --> 1144.84]  is that you have no choice
[1144.84 --> 1147.14]  but to do the imperative.
[1148.52 --> 1150.32]  This water keeps overflowing
[1150.32 --> 1151.44]  whether you like it or not
[1151.44 --> 1153.66]  when you receive that love.
[1153.66 --> 1161.80]  as sinners,
[1162.00 --> 1163.36]  that's where God meets us.
[1163.68 --> 1163.92]  And so,
[1164.02 --> 1164.84]  one of my favorite,
[1164.98 --> 1166.14]  most favorite verses
[1166.14 --> 1166.96]  in the whole Bible
[1166.96 --> 1168.34]  is Romans 5.8
[1168.34 --> 1169.56]  where it reflects
[1169.56 --> 1170.42]  God's love for us.
[1170.72 --> 1171.40]  But God
[1171.40 --> 1172.40]  demonstrates
[1172.40 --> 1173.40]  his own love
[1173.40 --> 1173.84]  for us
[1173.84 --> 1174.48]  in this.
[1175.44 --> 1176.00]  While
[1176.00 --> 1177.40]  we were still sinners,
[1177.82 --> 1178.84]  Christ died for us.
[1179.20 --> 1179.80]  While
[1179.80 --> 1181.00]  we were still sinners,
[1181.00 --> 1206.26]  Christ died for us.
[1206.26 --> 1209.46]  hope,
[1209.56 --> 1210.36]  do you believe
[1210.36 --> 1212.48]  that you have received
[1212.48 --> 1214.46]  God's downward love
[1214.46 --> 1215.70]  for you?
[1220.80 --> 1221.28]  Now,
[1221.36 --> 1222.02]  about now,
[1222.42 --> 1223.14]  we should address
[1223.14 --> 1224.10]  the issue of feet.
[1225.76 --> 1226.84]  Why feet?
[1227.52 --> 1228.80]  Why does it have to be
[1228.80 --> 1229.58]  the foot washing?
[1229.94 --> 1230.06]  Now,
[1230.06 --> 1231.66]  I get that it's the humble aspect.
[1231.94 --> 1232.92]  That's one part of it.
[1232.92 --> 1234.20]  But why feet?
[1234.60 --> 1235.42]  And I want to add
[1235.42 --> 1236.60]  a second perspective here.
[1237.24 --> 1237.90]  Why did Jesus
[1237.90 --> 1238.72]  wash the feet
[1238.72 --> 1239.86]  and not the hands
[1239.86 --> 1240.42]  or the head
[1240.42 --> 1241.70]  like Peter was asking?
[1245.02 --> 1246.80]  The first aspect of this,
[1247.00 --> 1247.76]  the first part
[1247.76 --> 1248.20]  of the reason
[1248.20 --> 1248.96]  of foot washing,
[1249.38 --> 1250.18]  as I have mentioned
[1250.18 --> 1250.78]  over and over,
[1251.04 --> 1252.26]  is God's humble love
[1252.26 --> 1252.94]  toward us.
[1253.66 --> 1254.70]  You can't get
[1254.70 --> 1255.40]  any humbler
[1255.40 --> 1256.38]  than what Jesus did
[1256.38 --> 1257.18]  as the teacher
[1257.18 --> 1258.00]  and the superior
[1258.00 --> 1259.18]  of his students
[1259.18 --> 1260.42]  than wash their dirty feet.
[1260.42 --> 1263.34]  That's a very important part
[1263.34 --> 1264.30]  that we should not forget.
[1265.30 --> 1266.34]  But the second reason,
[1266.52 --> 1266.98]  I think,
[1267.64 --> 1268.04]  reflects,
[1268.26 --> 1269.44]  the second aspect
[1269.44 --> 1270.64]  that I want to get across today,
[1270.96 --> 1272.06]  it reflects our mission.
[1274.78 --> 1275.96]  The imperative,
[1276.30 --> 1277.48]  the mission we have
[1277.48 --> 1278.08]  in Christ
[1278.08 --> 1279.30]  reflects
[1279.30 --> 1280.82]  the washing of feet.
[1281.90 --> 1282.30]  Why?
[1283.52 --> 1284.80]  Paul explains it well
[1284.80 --> 1286.00]  when he quotes Isaiah
[1286.00 --> 1287.88]  asking this rhetorical question.
[1288.50 --> 1289.70]  In Romans 10.15,
[1289.86 --> 1290.40]  Paul says,
[1290.42 --> 1290.94]  asks,
[1291.48 --> 1292.80]  How can anyone preach
[1292.80 --> 1294.56]  so proclaim the good news,
[1294.78 --> 1295.66]  the love of God,
[1295.86 --> 1297.14]  unless they are sent
[1297.14 --> 1299.78]  as it is written?
[1300.66 --> 1302.24]  How beautiful are the feet
[1302.24 --> 1304.28]  of those
[1304.28 --> 1306.60]  who bring the gospel,
[1306.76 --> 1307.50]  the good news.
[1308.32 --> 1309.76]  How beautiful are the feet.
[1310.24 --> 1311.02]  So why feet?
[1311.46 --> 1312.72]  Because we are sent.
[1313.80 --> 1315.04]  We are loved.
[1315.66 --> 1316.76]  And then we are sent.
[1316.76 --> 1317.50]  You see,
[1317.50 --> 1321.02]  Jesus even says this.
[1321.40 --> 1322.40]  After he washed
[1322.40 --> 1323.34]  his disciples' feet,
[1323.42 --> 1324.08]  he says to them,
[1324.40 --> 1325.26]  Now that I,
[1325.68 --> 1326.98]  your Lord and teacher,
[1327.06 --> 1328.12]  have washed your feet,
[1328.42 --> 1329.84]  you also should wash
[1329.84 --> 1330.92]  one another's feet.
[1330.92 --> 1333.66]  I have set you an example
[1333.66 --> 1334.82]  that you should do
[1334.82 --> 1335.76]  as I have done
[1335.76 --> 1336.30]  for you.
[1338.98 --> 1339.96]  Now if you're anything
[1339.96 --> 1340.44]  like me
[1340.44 --> 1341.30]  who grew up in the church,
[1341.40 --> 1342.06]  it's ironic
[1342.06 --> 1342.90]  how sometimes
[1342.90 --> 1344.60]  we think that Jesus
[1344.60 --> 1345.46]  is just giving us
[1345.46 --> 1346.70]  more commands
[1346.70 --> 1347.24]  to follow.
[1347.60 --> 1348.80]  Just new set of laws.
[1349.06 --> 1349.98]  Just interpret it
[1349.98 --> 1350.90]  in a different way.
[1352.20 --> 1352.86]  Old Testament,
[1353.14 --> 1353.76]  Ten Commandments,
[1353.86 --> 1354.08]  okay,
[1354.14 --> 1354.64]  I get it.
[1354.84 --> 1355.68]  But he fulfilled it,
[1355.70 --> 1356.56]  he accomplished it,
[1356.56 --> 1357.84]  and then he translated
[1357.84 --> 1358.50]  that for us
[1358.50 --> 1359.00]  so that we can
[1359.00 --> 1360.40]  follow a different
[1360.40 --> 1361.06]  set of commands.
[1363.24 --> 1364.70]  But this is actually
[1364.70 --> 1365.70]  an invitation
[1365.70 --> 1366.64]  that as servants
[1366.64 --> 1368.56]  and messengers of Christ
[1368.56 --> 1370.26]  who are no greater
[1370.26 --> 1370.78]  than him,
[1371.60 --> 1372.60]  we can enjoy
[1372.60 --> 1374.34]  a truly blessed life
[1374.34 --> 1375.86]  if we follow his ways
[1375.86 --> 1376.70]  by the empowering
[1376.70 --> 1377.54]  of the Holy Spirit.
[1378.44 --> 1379.22]  It is not just
[1379.22 --> 1380.62]  a set of new commands
[1380.62 --> 1381.16]  to follow
[1381.16 --> 1383.24]  and become all legalistic
[1383.24 --> 1383.76]  once again.
[1384.96 --> 1386.18]  It is an invitation
[1386.18 --> 1387.94]  it is a blessing.
[1389.22 --> 1390.56]  Jesus is showing us
[1390.56 --> 1391.62]  that in him
[1391.62 --> 1393.72]  we are more fully human.
[1394.04 --> 1395.76]  We are more fully ourselves
[1395.76 --> 1398.16]  when we are one with him.
[1399.82 --> 1400.78]  In other words,
[1400.84 --> 1401.66]  if you can picture this,
[1401.70 --> 1402.64]  it might be a little confusing.
[1402.80 --> 1403.40]  It was for me.
[1403.76 --> 1404.78]  It is our identity
[1404.78 --> 1406.22]  that produces the fruits
[1406.22 --> 1407.10]  of our mission
[1407.10 --> 1408.34]  and then our mission
[1408.34 --> 1409.34]  of loving others
[1409.34 --> 1411.76]  becomes a blessing for us
[1411.76 --> 1414.12]  which is part of our identity
[1414.12 --> 1414.56]  as well
[1414.56 --> 1415.88]  of being loved and blessed.
[1416.18 --> 1417.68]  So it is an ongoing cycle.
[1418.08 --> 1419.72]  You receive the love of God.
[1420.44 --> 1422.28]  It overflows onto others
[1422.28 --> 1423.20]  which is our mission.
[1423.56 --> 1425.12]  And as that overflow
[1425.12 --> 1426.44]  overflows,
[1426.70 --> 1428.10]  that overflowing itself
[1428.10 --> 1429.40]  is a blessing for us
[1429.40 --> 1430.66]  because that is what it means
[1430.66 --> 1431.22]  to live
[1431.22 --> 1433.74]  as a truly human being.
[1433.74 --> 1438.92]  what a beautiful cycle
[1438.92 --> 1440.16]  of a blessed life
[1440.16 --> 1440.66]  in Christ.
[1446.00 --> 1447.40]  So what does a blessed
[1447.40 --> 1448.52]  Christian life
[1448.52 --> 1449.50]  look like for you,
[1449.58 --> 1449.76]  Hope?
[1451.50 --> 1452.82]  How does your identity
[1452.82 --> 1453.76]  as the receivers
[1453.76 --> 1455.28]  of the love of Christ
[1455.28 --> 1456.88]  overflow onto others?
[1456.88 --> 1460.02]  in your homes,
[1460.64 --> 1461.50]  in your workplace,
[1461.76 --> 1462.76]  in your daily living,
[1463.04 --> 1464.14]  in what ways
[1464.14 --> 1464.86]  does the world
[1464.86 --> 1465.78]  witness Christ
[1465.78 --> 1467.38]  in your blessed life?
[1467.38 --> 1472.14]  It can be as simple
[1472.14 --> 1473.80]  as being humble enough
[1473.80 --> 1476.04]  to admit your mistake
[1476.04 --> 1476.72]  and apologize
[1476.72 --> 1478.06]  to your four-year-old son.
[1482.70 --> 1483.76]  It can be praying
[1483.76 --> 1484.54]  for someone you know
[1484.54 --> 1485.16]  who is struggling
[1485.16 --> 1485.94]  or is sick
[1485.94 --> 1487.98]  or sympathizing
[1487.98 --> 1488.46]  with someone
[1488.46 --> 1489.86]  who feels too shamed
[1489.86 --> 1491.18]  or unloved
[1491.18 --> 1492.26]  to come to church.
[1492.26 --> 1494.66]  It can be living
[1494.66 --> 1495.32]  in gratitude
[1495.32 --> 1496.66]  because we know
[1496.66 --> 1497.98]  that we too
[1497.98 --> 1498.84]  are sinners
[1498.84 --> 1499.88]  who have received
[1499.88 --> 1501.02]  His love.
[1503.86 --> 1505.60]  And so talking to Dave
[1505.60 --> 1506.82]  this past week,
[1507.56 --> 1508.44]  he reminded me
[1508.44 --> 1509.60]  of the beautiful truth
[1509.60 --> 1511.04]  of how when we
[1511.04 --> 1511.92]  are in the presence
[1511.92 --> 1512.54]  of God,
[1513.58 --> 1514.78]  however that happens
[1514.78 --> 1515.20]  for you,
[1515.62 --> 1516.38]  through devotions,
[1516.56 --> 1517.08]  through prayer,
[1517.46 --> 1518.48]  through gathered worship,
[1518.74 --> 1519.62]  through family worship,
[1520.42 --> 1521.70]  and when we
[1521.70 --> 1522.54]  are reminded
[1522.54 --> 1523.38]  of our identity
[1523.38 --> 1524.88]  as receivers
[1524.88 --> 1525.88]  of God's love,
[1527.16 --> 1528.68]  God opens up,
[1529.06 --> 1529.84]  I love this,
[1530.04 --> 1531.68]  I can't give full credit
[1531.68 --> 1532.06]  to Dave
[1532.06 --> 1532.72]  because he got it
[1532.72 --> 1533.38]  from someone else,
[1534.90 --> 1536.40]  God opens up
[1536.40 --> 1537.62]  our imaginations,
[1539.14 --> 1540.56]  opens up our minds
[1540.56 --> 1541.20]  and our hearts
[1541.20 --> 1542.76]  to think of those
[1542.76 --> 1544.10]  who really need
[1544.10 --> 1544.88]  the love of God.
[1548.50 --> 1549.48]  For me,
[1549.48 --> 1551.70]  when I'm doing
[1551.70 --> 1552.46]  my devotions,
[1552.54 --> 1553.34]  being in the presence
[1553.34 --> 1553.82]  of God,
[1553.90 --> 1554.58]  and I must admit
[1554.58 --> 1555.70]  this is very irregular,
[1556.38 --> 1557.26]  don't hear me
[1557.26 --> 1557.88]  like bragging
[1557.88 --> 1559.92]  about how I'm so devoted
[1559.92 --> 1561.36]  every day of my life
[1561.36 --> 1562.16]  doing devotions,
[1563.04 --> 1564.28]  but as irregular
[1564.28 --> 1564.98]  as it is,
[1565.14 --> 1566.10]  when I'm in the presence
[1566.10 --> 1566.68]  of God,
[1567.76 --> 1568.66]  the Holy Spirit
[1568.66 --> 1569.24]  opens up
[1569.24 --> 1570.14]  my imagination,
[1570.36 --> 1571.88]  my very limited imagination,
[1572.42 --> 1573.66]  and He opens it up.
[1574.00 --> 1575.12]  And every single time
[1575.12 --> 1575.78]  I do devotion
[1575.78 --> 1576.70]  on my kitchen table,
[1577.34 --> 1578.30]  because we're so close,
[1578.30 --> 1579.42]  I live in like a townhouse
[1579.42 --> 1580.76]  complex where my neighbors
[1580.76 --> 1581.94]  are literally my neighbors
[1581.94 --> 1582.98]  who share walls.
[1583.42 --> 1584.82]  We share literal walls.
[1585.12 --> 1585.58]  And so,
[1586.34 --> 1587.40]  whenever I'm in the presence
[1587.40 --> 1587.92]  of God,
[1588.50 --> 1589.56]  God reminds me,
[1590.62 --> 1591.62]  you need to love
[1591.62 --> 1592.62]  your physical neighbors
[1592.62 --> 1593.46]  that are around you.
[1594.46 --> 1595.56]  I want you to share
[1595.56 --> 1596.36]  my love with them.
[1598.72 --> 1599.16]  Now,
[1599.24 --> 1599.66]  I haven't done
[1599.66 --> 1600.46]  a good job of it,
[1601.16 --> 1602.48]  but it can be like
[1602.48 --> 1603.98]  just having a conversation
[1603.98 --> 1604.70]  with my neighbor
[1604.70 --> 1605.68]  who lives next door.
[1605.68 --> 1607.68]  just saying hello,
[1607.80 --> 1608.38]  how you've been,
[1608.76 --> 1609.76]  haven't seen you in a while.
[1611.10 --> 1611.68]  And then,
[1611.76 --> 1612.28]  all of a sudden,
[1612.40 --> 1613.06]  that five minute,
[1613.22 --> 1614.12]  not even five minute,
[1614.28 --> 1615.40]  that two minute conversation
[1615.40 --> 1616.46]  that you had in your mind
[1616.46 --> 1617.54]  becomes a 30,
[1617.60 --> 1618.54]  40 minute conversation
[1618.54 --> 1619.10]  because
[1619.10 --> 1620.72]  he's been struggling
[1620.72 --> 1623.20]  with COVID.
[1624.88 --> 1625.76]  Mental challenges
[1625.76 --> 1627.26]  because of COVID.
[1627.74 --> 1628.66]  Just the struggles.
[1628.66 --> 1635.50]  As a pastor,
[1635.98 --> 1636.82]  I have this,
[1637.52 --> 1638.78]  I put this on myself.
[1638.98 --> 1639.64]  As a pastor,
[1639.88 --> 1641.32]  as an up and coming pastor,
[1641.56 --> 1643.04]  how can I be more pastoral?
[1643.74 --> 1644.60]  How can I live
[1644.60 --> 1645.36]  into my identity
[1645.36 --> 1646.28]  because God called me
[1646.28 --> 1646.92]  to be a pastor?
[1647.34 --> 1648.44]  I feel like I'm not
[1648.44 --> 1649.44]  doing my mission enough.
[1650.02 --> 1650.92]  I feel like I'm not
[1650.92 --> 1651.66]  a pastor enough
[1651.66 --> 1652.24]  for people.
[1653.80 --> 1654.10]  And so,
[1654.18 --> 1654.42]  I'm like,
[1654.52 --> 1654.68]  okay,
[1654.76 --> 1655.88]  how can I be more creative?
[1656.12 --> 1656.84]  How can I pastor
[1656.84 --> 1657.46]  more people?
[1658.42 --> 1659.14]  Should I ask Dave
[1659.14 --> 1660.18]  for more phone numbers
[1660.18 --> 1660.70]  from our church
[1660.70 --> 1661.58]  so that I can call up
[1661.58 --> 1662.86]  everybody and say,
[1662.94 --> 1663.08]  okay,
[1663.12 --> 1663.80]  I'm a pastor too.
[1663.96 --> 1664.44]  What do you need?
[1666.54 --> 1667.10]  That's like,
[1667.14 --> 1667.64]  I shared this
[1667.64 --> 1668.20]  in the first sermon.
[1668.50 --> 1669.38]  That's like an image
[1669.38 --> 1670.12]  not of a bowl
[1670.12 --> 1670.94]  that overflows,
[1671.24 --> 1672.20]  but it's like me
[1672.20 --> 1673.18]  taking a water gun,
[1673.28 --> 1673.84]  filling it with
[1673.84 --> 1674.56]  God's love,
[1674.72 --> 1674.98]  water,
[1675.18 --> 1675.80]  and then trying to
[1675.80 --> 1676.84]  spray everyone with it.
[1679.26 --> 1680.38]  That's not the image
[1680.38 --> 1682.00]  that the Bible tells us.
[1682.64 --> 1684.08]  We are a broken bowl
[1684.08 --> 1684.86]  put back together
[1684.86 --> 1685.76]  because we ourselves
[1685.76 --> 1686.20]  are sinners.
[1686.20 --> 1688.12]  We receive His love
[1688.12 --> 1689.46]  and it overflows.
[1691.98 --> 1693.84]  Sometimes it's intentional.
[1694.06 --> 1695.06]  Sometimes it's not.
[1695.62 --> 1696.36]  Just the hi,
[1696.48 --> 1697.06]  how you've been?
[1697.72 --> 1698.60]  And then all of a sudden,
[1699.16 --> 1700.30]  can I talk to you?
[1706.34 --> 1706.96]  And so,
[1707.08 --> 1707.84]  I want to invite
[1707.84 --> 1709.06]  you this morning
[1709.06 --> 1710.34]  to receive His love.
[1710.34 --> 1712.78]  and in being reminded
[1712.78 --> 1713.92]  of this identity
[1713.92 --> 1715.18]  as receivers
[1715.18 --> 1716.12]  of His love,
[1717.12 --> 1718.30]  let God
[1718.30 --> 1719.24]  open your
[1719.24 --> 1720.10]  imaginations
[1720.10 --> 1722.32]  to whom
[1722.32 --> 1723.26]  you can serve,
[1723.82 --> 1724.10]  to whom
[1724.10 --> 1724.80]  you can bless.
[1726.84 --> 1727.78]  That is why
[1727.78 --> 1728.82]  our feet
[1728.82 --> 1729.38]  are beautiful.
[1730.12 --> 1730.74]  I think I have
[1730.74 --> 1731.30]  ugly feet,
[1731.82 --> 1732.92]  but God
[1732.92 --> 1733.68]  says that
[1733.68 --> 1734.26]  my feet
[1734.26 --> 1734.84]  are beautiful
[1734.84 --> 1736.14]  because my feet
[1736.14 --> 1736.82]  are the feet
[1736.82 --> 1737.80]  that sends me
[1737.80 --> 1738.84]  to share the love
[1738.84 --> 1739.64]  of Christ to others.
[1739.64 --> 1741.20]  and so,
[1741.20 --> 1742.02]  your feet
[1742.02 --> 1742.64]  are beautiful.
[1743.36 --> 1744.54]  However you may think
[1744.54 --> 1744.98]  of your feet,
[1745.06 --> 1746.12]  your feet are beautiful.
[1746.70 --> 1747.52]  You are sent
[1747.52 --> 1748.68]  by God
[1748.68 --> 1750.04]  to share His love.
[1751.50 --> 1752.04]  And so,
[1752.12 --> 1753.28]  it is my deep desire
[1753.28 --> 1753.82]  this morning
[1753.82 --> 1755.26]  that you hope
[1755.26 --> 1756.74]  you live
[1756.74 --> 1757.84]  into this identity
[1757.84 --> 1759.22]  as receivers
[1759.22 --> 1760.14]  of God's love.
[1760.14 --> 1760.28]  love.
[1762.34 --> 1762.98]  Let's pray.
[1771.32 --> 1772.08]  Loving Father,
[1772.22 --> 1772.72]  we thank You
[1772.72 --> 1773.18]  so much
[1773.18 --> 1773.82]  for this morning.
[1775.70 --> 1776.56]  We thank You
[1776.56 --> 1777.14]  that You
[1777.14 --> 1778.52]  continue to
[1778.52 --> 1781.32]  guide us
[1781.32 --> 1781.76]  as we,
[1783.76 --> 1784.60]  whether we like it
[1784.60 --> 1784.90]  or not,
[1784.98 --> 1785.16]  Lord,
[1785.16 --> 1786.38]  You remind us
[1786.38 --> 1788.72]  that when we are
[1788.72 --> 1789.94]  in Your presence,
[1790.88 --> 1792.06]  You overpower
[1792.06 --> 1792.90]  whatever intentions
[1792.90 --> 1793.88]  that we may have,
[1795.00 --> 1797.28]  that You guide us
[1797.28 --> 1798.14]  and You lead us
[1798.14 --> 1799.46]  with Your wisdom
[1799.46 --> 1801.10]  to share this
[1801.10 --> 1802.32]  gospel truth,
[1803.02 --> 1803.72]  this love
[1803.72 --> 1804.56]  that You have
[1804.56 --> 1805.66]  shown
[1805.66 --> 1807.14]  and have given
[1807.14 --> 1807.98]  to us
[1807.98 --> 1809.74]  so that it becomes
[1809.74 --> 1811.58]  an overflowing love
[1811.58 --> 1812.24]  unto others,
[1812.24 --> 1813.96]  which is such
[1813.96 --> 1814.48]  a blessing.
[1815.88 --> 1816.88]  We thank You
[1816.88 --> 1817.52]  that You have
[1817.52 --> 1818.14]  allowed us
[1818.14 --> 1818.78]  to be
[1818.78 --> 1820.56]  a blessed
[1820.56 --> 1821.26]  people.
[1823.20 --> 1824.10]  I pray
[1824.10 --> 1825.32]  and I seek
[1825.32 --> 1827.30]  Your continual
[1827.30 --> 1827.76]  wisdom
[1827.76 --> 1828.48]  and guidance
[1828.48 --> 1831.12]  so that You
[1831.12 --> 1831.84]  can open up
[1831.84 --> 1832.72]  our imaginations
[1832.72 --> 1834.38]  and we can
[1834.38 --> 1834.90]  reach out
[1834.90 --> 1835.46]  to those
[1835.46 --> 1836.04]  who really,
[1836.68 --> 1837.64]  who really need
[1837.64 --> 1838.06]  Your love,
[1838.18 --> 1838.36]  Lord,
[1839.42 --> 1840.74]  wherever they are
[1840.74 --> 1842.24]  in whatever
[1842.24 --> 1842.90]  situation
[1842.90 --> 1843.76]  they may be in.
[1844.60 --> 1845.08]  Help us
[1845.08 --> 1845.66]  to meet them
[1845.66 --> 1845.98]  there
[1845.98 --> 1847.16]  and to share
[1847.16 --> 1847.60]  Your love.
[1849.00 --> 1849.58]  Guide us,
[1849.78 --> 1849.84]  Lord.
[1850.04 --> 1850.62]  We thank You
[1850.62 --> 1850.98]  and in Jesus'
[1851.10 --> 1851.58]  name we pray.
[1852.58 --> 1852.98]  Amen.
[1854.22 --> 1855.02]  I invite you
[1855.02 --> 1855.54]  to stand
[1855.54 --> 1856.20]  as we sing
[1856.20 --> 1857.24]  our song of response.
[1857.24 --> 1857.60]  Amen.
