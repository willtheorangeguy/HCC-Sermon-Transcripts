[0.00 → 9.02] well hope you're not going to believe it, but we are actually, actually coming to the end of our
[9.02 → 13.00] sermon series on john some of you are like I don't actually believe it Dave's going to throw
[13.00 → 17.34] another sermon in there, but we actually are finishing today it's been four months and so
[17.34 → 19.96] and I know that you're probably looking forward to a new series but I will say
[19.96 → 25.04] I hope it's been as nourishing for you as it is for us as preachers this has been one of my
[25.04 → 28.10] favourites it's hard to pick one, but it's one of my favourite sermon series to preach through
[28.10 → 33.46] so let's finish it together if you have your bible turn with me to john chapter 21
[33.46 → 40.48] and we'll start at verse 15 this is Jesus recommissioning reinstating and sending peter
[40.48 → 41.70] into ministry
[41.70 → 52.96] when they had finished eating Jesus said to Simon peter Simon son of john do you love me more than
[52.96 → 61.82] these yes lord he said you know that I love you Jesus said feed my lambs again Jesus said Simon
[61.82 → 69.68] son of john do you love me he answered yes lord you know that I love you Jesus said take care of my
[69.68 → 78.16] sheep the third time he said to him Simon son of john do you love me peter was hurt because Jesus
[78.16 → 83.92] asked him the third time do you love me he said lord you know all things you know that I love you
[84.64 → 91.20] Jesus said feed my sheep very truly I tell you when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where
[91.20 → 96.00] you wanted but when you were older you will stretch out your hands and someone else will dress you and
[96.00 → 101.40] lead you were you do not want to go Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which peter would
[101.40 → 109.36] glorify god then he said to him follow me peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved
[109.36 → 114.08] was following them this was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said lord
[114.08 → 121.16] who is going to betray you when Peter saw him he asked lord what about him Jesus answered if I want
[121.16 → 127.90] him to remain alive until I return what is that to you, you must follow me because of this a rumour spread
[127.90 → 132.70] among the believers that this disciple would not die but Jesus did not say that he would not die he
[132.70 → 138.92] only said if I want him to remain alive until I return what is that to you this is the disciple who
[138.92 → 146.94] testifies to these things and who wrote them down we know that his testimony is true Jesus did many other
[146.94 → 153.04] things as well if every one of them were written down I suppose that even the whole world would not have
[153.04 → 160.60] room for the books that would be written I love the way he finishes that there would not be enough books
[160.60 → 163.10] to count all the books written about Jesus
[163.10 → 170.64] when I was in high school many years ago now I remember standing at lunch with a circle of my
[170.64 → 175.98] friends outside, and we're having a conversation about a whole number of things and my friend standing
[175.98 → 181.40] across the circle from me happened to be talking about this girl in our class and speaking unkind
[181.40 → 187.06] things about this particular girl, and it's one of the situations whereas he was speaking this girl
[187.06 → 193.14] was walking on the sidewalk towards the school right behind him, and he just so happened to say
[193.14 → 200.38] an unusually cruel thing about her just as she was behind him, and she heard every word I remember her
[200.38 → 205.90] she kept her head down and just kept walking into the classroom and of course the second he realized
[205.90 → 212.70] what he had done he put his hands on his face and he dropped to his knees in pure shame and guilt
[212.70 → 219.58] you have ever done something like that were the words that came out of your mouth you just could not bring
[219.58 → 225.98] them back you said something that could not be unsaid and the person heard it, and you don't have to live
[225.98 → 231.26] with being the person who spoke so flippantly so foolishly and wish that you could somehow just repair
[231.26 → 237.50] what you had just done in that word if you can experience that or enter into that experience
[237.50 → 245.20] you can understand what peter is going through as pastor SID preached on last week peter was you
[245.20 → 251.22] might say the alpha disciple peter was the one who made audacious claims about his loyalty and his
[251.22 → 255.58] commitment to Jesus and the mission that Jesus was bringing them on and yet it's peter as pastor
[255.58 → 258.94] SID mentioned last week you know he said he wasn't going to preach my sermon, but he did
[258.94 → 265.26] it's peter who buckled under the first question of a servant girl around the fire who simply asked
[265.26 → 271.46] aren't you one of Jesus disciples, and he denounces knowledge of Jesus and of course someone asked him
[271.46 → 280.18] again and again peter doubles and triples down saying I do not know Jesus only to realize as Luke describes
[280.18 → 286.20] that Jesus is right across the courtyard, and he locks eyes with peter right after the third denial
[286.20 → 294.92] oh could you imagine that scene that would be gutting for peter he's now the one who spoke the
[294.92 → 300.44] words that can't be unspoken he's the one who sees Jesus afterwards, and it can't be undone that denial
[300.44 → 308.04] moment I can imagine that peter probably thinking to himself those three words cost him three years
[308.04 → 314.72] of ministry those three words made him disqualified now to continue on with whatever Jesus had in mind for
[314.72 → 324.56] him he's now out of the game and john saves this story for last isn't it interesting he saves Jesus
[324.56 → 329.66] addressing peter for last Jesus has met with Mary and her grief he met with the disciples and their fear
[329.66 → 334.54] he met with Thomas and his doubt and now after the breakfast on the beach the last breakfast we have
[334.54 → 343.32] recorded of Jesus he faces peter, and he has a word just for peter that peter I think is desperate to hear
[343.32 → 350.20] and his word is grace and his truth he names the elephant in the room, and he says peter it's done
[350.20 → 358.88] you're forgiven you're back in the game I've got work for you to do that's my summary of john 21
[358.88 → 364.28] if you have your bible let's now take a closer look at these powerful words of recommissioning
[364.28 → 371.16] now the first thing to notice about john 21 is that Jesus calls peter not by his name peter he calls
[371.16 → 375.80] him Simon son of john three times he calls him Simon son of john and if you look at John's gospel
[375.80 → 382.04] the last time Jesus calls him that is at the very beginning of Peter's life with Jesus fishing on the
[382.04 → 388.18] sea Jesus comes to him he says Simon son of john follow me, and it's almost as though we're now back
[388.18 → 395.28] to the beginning and Jesus saying here we are again peter you by the sea me calling out to you Simon
[395.28 → 400.48] son of john, and now we have to have a new beginning and deal with what has taken place here
[402.00 → 409.20] and so he says to Simon son of john his pre-disciple name he says three questions three piercing questions
[409.20 → 413.52] because those questions bring peter right back to the three denials and what's the question
[414.96 → 421.52] he does not say what a parent might say to the child why did you deny me why did you do this he says
[421.52 → 427.92] to Simon peter do you love me isn't that a striking question he goes right to the heart of
[427.92 → 436.56] the Christian faith do you love me interestingly the first time Jesus asked this question in verse 15
[436.56 → 442.64] he says it this way he says peter do you love me more than these that is to say do you love me more
[442.64 → 447.84] than the other disciples the other disciples who just happen to be around the same fire right there
[448.64 → 452.56] and I can't help but think that's kind of a cruel question I mean imagine a parent said to their
[452.56 → 457.20] child with all their siblings around do you love me more than the other children do you love your
[457.20 → 462.72] mother more than the other children on Mother's Day it's a trap right it feels that way and there's a
[462.72 → 467.76] lot of different takes on why does Jesus make Simon peter compare himself to the other disciples and
[467.76 → 474.40] the answer I think has all to do with his past peter was known to be the disciple who made the grand
[474.40 → 479.68] statements right his loyalty was greater than the other disciples his commitment was bigger and his
[479.68 → 483.76] love was sincerer, and he's always elevating himself above the other disciples and now Jesus
[483.76 → 491.28] says here they are here you are do you love me more than them and peter shows I think a profound level
[491.28 → 501.12] of humility and understanding he simply says Jesus you know that I love you nothing more nothing less
[501.12 → 506.64] and what Jesus wants Simon peter to know is it's no longer about comparison it's simply the fact do
[506.64 → 514.08] you peter love me you know two years ago our staff was reading a book called in the name of Jesus
[514.08 → 518.88] by Henry now and Henry now and if you haven't read him he's a very good author he has some piercing
[518.88 → 524.72] insights on all the idols of leadership but now in writing to Christian leaders says these words about
[524.72 → 532.32] the centre of leadership he writes the question is not how many people take you seriously how much are
[532.32 → 539.12] you going to accomplish can you show me some results and Christian leaders love results but the question
[539.12 → 545.36] is are you in love with Jesus perhaps another way of putting the question would be done you know the
[545.36 → 551.36] incarnate god, and he concludes in our world of loneliness and despair there is an enormous need
[551.36 → 558.40] for men and women who know the heart of god what Jesus is after as he addresses peter, and he names
[558.40 → 566.40] the elephant in the room he's like do you love me do you know my love that is at the centre
[568.32 → 574.56] and with that we should know Peter's back in the game this is a recommissioning all Jesus asks of him
[574.56 → 578.08] is do you love me he didn't even say will you do this again what's your future gonna look at he says do you
[578.08 → 584.88] love me perfect you're ready I will commission you into ministry with those three questions and Jesus
[584.88 → 589.68] wipes away his sin he goes to the deepest place of Peter's failure, and he says peter I've got work
[589.68 → 596.40] for you to do you're back I would love to have seen Peter's face and I happen to think that Jesus
[596.40 → 601.36] asking peter three times is almost a way of peter pairing the worst memory with what might be his
[601.36 → 606.00] favourite memory it's no longer when he thinks back on his ministry with Jesus he thinks to the worst
[606.00 → 611.36] moment of denial he now thinks remember the time Jesus said do you love me, and he commissioned me
[613.12 → 617.28] now you'll notice that every one of the times Jesus asks do you love me he pairs
[617.28 → 621.68] it with commissioning it's an important thing for us to realize because Jesus doesn't just forgive his
[621.68 → 627.20] grace doesn't just cover over and wipe away what's happened in the past it actually propels and strengthens
[627.20 → 631.60] peter for service that's what grace always does it's not just something that cancels it's something
[631.60 → 637.04] that equips and so look at these questions of love paired with the words of commission he says Simon
[637.04 → 644.00] son of john do you love me verse 15 feed my sheep or sorry feed my lambs Simon son of john do you love
[644.00 → 652.80] me take care of my sheep and finally Simon son of john do you love me feed my sheep peter is called to be a
[652.80 → 657.84] shepherd that's what Jesus wants him to do he's got two specific jobs to do they're actually quite
[657.84 → 664.24] simple job number one feed the church job number two take care of the church that's it he doesn't
[664.24 → 668.56] say to peter hey I want you to win the whole Mediterranean world over to Jesus I want you to
[668.56 → 673.36] go to all these different cities and do all this different work he simply says here's your job feed
[673.36 → 681.52] the church teach them well take care of the church all take care of the rest it's simple and just take a
[681.52 → 688.24] look for a minute at what these two things might entail feed the church one writer says that is a
[688.24 → 694.88] way of saying peter your job is to nurture young believers into the life of Jesus so that they know
[694.88 → 700.72] Jesus and make Jesus known that's the essence of it make Jesus known understand who Jesus is and central
[700.72 → 706.72] to that and this goes to us as pastors central that is teaching and I think there's actually a pretty
[706.72 → 712.24] strong warning in this passage for teachers because Peter needs to feed the church well he's in
[712.24 → 716.00] charge of making sure they get well-fed and well nurtured, and they understand the love of Christ and
[716.00 → 720.16] that will have to come through faithful teaching if you look at some of the instruction in the new
[720.16 → 724.48] testament especially in first and second timothy in the New Testament you'll see that so much of the
[724.48 → 732.00] emphasis for teachers pastors and leaders is sound teaching there is a real sense of warning it says
[732.00 → 736.24] don't you as teachers and this is to me and all the other leaders in our church don't you teach them
[736.24 → 740.48] just what they like don't teach them just what's popular in their day don't teach them just what
[740.48 → 746.64] is easy for their ears to hear teach them what Jesus Christ by his word has given the church season in
[747.28 → 752.16] season out feed them with the life of the gospel and there's the challenge for the pastors in this
[752.16 → 757.84] passage but not just that the essence of being a leader in the church the essence of Peter's
[757.84 → 764.56] recommissioning is actually to the ministry of care take care of the church or as a pastor friend
[764.56 → 770.40] of mine his name is David Fairchild has once put it he says beware I love this bewares of the T. rex pastor
[771.36 → 778.00] have you heard this one before a T. rex has a big mouth but what else does the T. rex have tiny useless
[778.00 → 784.16] little hands and Dave Fairchild says beware of the T. rex pastor who has a lot to say to you but doesn't
[784.16 → 791.76] actually care for you and leadership I think always comes down to real care you cannot be an effective
[791.76 → 797.12] faithful leader in any situation without actually being present in a posture of care, and you know
[797.12 → 803.44] who models that well in our church pastor SID Underwood now I know some of you have joked that
[803.44 → 807.60] I throw him under the bus too much on my sermon so I'm going to redeem myself by saying some nice things
[807.60 → 814.16] about pastor SID but a year ago we had a celebration service for him where we celebrated 65 years of life
[814.16 → 818.64] still kicking where are you SID you're somewhere around here he's back there and his 25 years of
[818.64 → 823.12] ministry along with candy in our church and I remember interviewing people we put a video together
[823.12 → 826.96] and every time we asked people what do you remember about SID they said his preaching was amazing
[827.52 → 835.12] he's very competitive that came up so many times, but the third thing was he showed up he showed up
[835.12 → 839.04] when marriages fell apart he was in the living room praying with the couple he showed up when the
[839.04 → 844.80] doctor's notice came back and the word was bad he was there in the hospital room celebrating communion
[844.80 → 850.16] with people one-on-one praying with them, he was at the membership classes early setting up chairs late
[850.16 → 856.72] mopping the floors and stacking the cups because his wife told him to right and isn't it fitting SID that
[856.72 → 864.08] your title now is pastor of care, although he said to me this Monday in our membership class he says that
[864.08 → 869.20] means that I am the pastor of don't care love you too SID really appreciate that
[869.20 → 876.40] one more important point to pick up on this recommissioning every time Jesus gives a word
[876.40 → 885.68] of commissioning to peter he says feed my sheep who do the sheep belong to not peter who does the
[885.68 → 891.12] church belong to not the pastor not the denomination the church at the end of the day will always belong
[891.12 → 897.04] to Jesus Christ and I happen to think if we really believe that it would transform the life of the church
[897.04 → 900.00] because when you're talking to someone else in the church you're leading someone else in the church
[900.00 → 905.04] you're leading a ministry with brothers and sisters they are never just sheep they are Jesus sheep
[905.92 → 911.12] they are bought with his blood promised his forgiveness sealed with the Holy Spirit given
[911.12 → 918.16] new life by Jesus himself and that is a sacred thing and that therefore we do small groups, and we do
[918.16 → 922.96] church ministry on Sunday when we worship, and we disciple we are always living in the presence of Jesus
[922.96 → 929.20] Jesus sacred body Jesus sheep yes we might be dumb, but we're Jesus sheep
[932.56 → 938.72] so far in this passage I think it's so encouraging peter comes to Jesus in his broken humble state Jesus
[938.72 → 942.48] asks him the simple question do you love me peter says yes and Jesus says I've got work for you to do
[942.48 → 948.24] Simon peter you're back in the game it all seems so great, and then we get to verse 18 which in my opinion
[948.24 → 955.68] is super sobering and let me read it for you Jesus says to peter very truly I tell you when you were
[955.68 → 960.32] younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted but when you were old you will stretch out
[960.32 → 966.64] your hands and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go Jesus said this to
[966.64 → 971.28] indicate the kind of death by which peter would glorify god, and you know what that death was he was
[971.28 → 980.72] crucified upside down that's how peter died that's super sobering isn't it and let me be clear peter had
[980.72 → 985.12] remarkable joy in his ministry and I do mean remarkable joy peter got to witness some of the
[985.12 → 990.80] most amazing things he would go to cities share the gospel and people believed it he would see
[990.80 → 994.64] miracles he would see the very power of Christ working through his words working through his life
[994.64 → 999.20] working through the life of the church, and he would witness just in awe the resurrection showing up and
[999.20 → 1005.76] building churches growing churches he would see Jews and gentiles who hated each other he would see
[1005.76 → 1014.32] them sharing communion together proving to the city the reconciling power of the cross but Jesus makes
[1014.32 → 1020.56] it clears to him straight up in this commission he says peter it's not all roses you will be persecuted
[1020.56 → 1028.16] you will suffer, and you will ultimately give up your life in martyrdom from my name imagine how peter would
[1028.16 → 1034.32] have heard that and of the many things I could say about that particular passage let me just say this
[1034.32 → 1040.32] it is a warning to the church that discipleship is not comfort it is not ease Jesus never promises
[1040.32 → 1046.00] those things he promises joy promises resurrection, but he does not promise comfort and ease and
[1046.00 → 1052.16] I think we need to realize in comfortable western society that we are not called to an easy simple life
[1052.16 → 1059.60] we're called to follow Jesus and to let him lead us where we might not choose to go ourselves and trust
[1059.60 → 1066.32] that it is Jesus leading and his word to us is you take up your cross you follow me I take the lead
[1068.32 → 1074.24] and what are Jesus final words to peter the same words that started Peter's ministry started Peter's
[1074.24 → 1082.64] discipleship peter follow me he's back to where he started he's back to being commissioned he's back
[1082.64 → 1088.24] with a simple invitation follow me although I want to highlight what I think one scholar rightly points
[1088.24 → 1093.20] out there's something different this is not the same as Peter's first calling where Jesus says follow
[1093.20 → 1100.16] me something has changed it's not peter it's Jesus this time when Jesus says to peter follow me his hands
[1100.16 → 1104.88] have the holes and his side has the piercing because Jesus has gone to the grave, and he's risen
[1104.88 → 1110.00] victorious over the grave and right after saying to peter you're going to die for me, he says peter
[1110.00 → 1114.80] follow me and I believe built into that invitation is the promise peter you're going to die
[1115.60 → 1122.80] and you will rise with me because where I have gone you will come with me that's the promise
[1124.96 → 1129.76] now let me conclude with some ways that I believe this passage speaks into our ordinary lives
[1129.76 → 1136.88] here in west coast British Columbia number one I think Peter is intended to represent the church
[1136.88 → 1141.60] I think John tells us the story at the end because this is not just Peter's story it's all of our stories
[1142.48 → 1149.76] can you relate to this peter was impulsive he was weak, and he caved under pressure when his faith was
[1149.76 → 1157.60] under fire can you relate to that can you relate to caving under the pressure peter gave in when things got
[1157.60 → 1162.00] difficult he was not strong enough for the challenges of ministry can you relate to that
[1163.44 → 1169.36] aren't there times in your and my life where we think I have so botched my discipleship journey I should
[1169.36 → 1176.48] just pack it up I mean I am so broken and patterns of my life are so unlike Jesus I have no business being
[1176.48 → 1185.20] here on Sunday morning have you ever felt that that's Peter's story and now if that's true for you, I want
[1185.20 → 1190.00] you to hear the power of what Jesus says to peter he says peter he knew first that peter was
[1190.00 → 1194.56] going to fail him he knew and predicted that peter was going to deny him and nothing surprised Jesus
[1195.20 → 1200.32] he looks at this man who is humbled he's broken he failed Jesus, and he says peter what matters to me is
[1200.32 → 1207.76] do you love me and this is the same Jesus who says in Luke these powerful words that we need to hear he says
[1207.76 → 1214.48] it's not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick who are the sick I have not come to call the
[1214.48 → 1221.68] righteous but sinners to repentance and Jesus looks at peter who's humble Jesus looks at peter who
[1221.68 → 1229.12] acknowledges his love for him, he says it's good your sin is wiped out it's behind you, I have cleansed you
[1229.12 → 1236.16] I've forgiven what's gone in the past I know you love me you're sent praise the lord that peter wasn't
[1236.16 → 1241.20] written off by his worst failure don't you think praise the lord that that moment of threefold
[1241.20 → 1245.92] denial was not the end of his discipleship journey guess what church Jesus hasn't changed
[1247.76 → 1252.72] praise the lord that you haven't been right not written off by your worst sin
[1254.48 → 1260.40] praise the lord that your discipleship journey hasn't come to a grinding halt by your worst failures
[1260.40 → 1267.28] the same Jesus who looks at peter and all of his complexity says to the church today his question
[1267.28 → 1276.24] is the same do you love me do you love me do you love me and if the answer is yes good news church
[1276.96 → 1282.88] he says to us just like he said to peter you're back in the game it's not over for you, I am the god of
[1282.88 → 1287.52] grace who has finished the work on the cross and I have good work for you to do not in your strength but in
[1287.52 → 1296.88] mind you're back in the game hear that for the church today and let me add this peter will continue
[1296.88 → 1301.36] to fail in fact we have knowledge of this to the New Testament but even an interesting little tidbit
[1301.36 → 1306.24] in this story is right after Jesus tells peter he's like peter you're going to be crucified upside down
[1307.20 → 1312.96] for my glory you know what Peter's first thing back to him is he's like hey uh John's over there
[1312.96 → 1318.40] how's john going to die it's going to be as bad as my death and I could just imagine Jesus saying to
[1318.40 → 1323.92] peter like peter you worry about you, I'll worry about john let's not let's not start some speculation
[1323.92 → 1330.72] about john living forever how about that peter, but you read Galatians 2 where Paul is addressing all
[1330.72 → 1338.32] the legalism in the church and guess who Paul names as being divisive and difficult surprise peter
[1338.32 → 1345.68] impulsive brash peter is still struggling with his identity he's still struggling with his behaviour
[1345.68 → 1350.64] and Paul has to stand toe to toe with peter who's having issues between Jews and gentiles and creating
[1350.64 → 1357.44] division and Paul has to stand him down Peter's still working on it is that amazing and Jesus isn't
[1357.44 → 1362.56] worried by that Jesus isn't concerned about that he knows Peter's broken he knows Paul is too and
[1362.56 → 1370.00] both of them he equips with his grace to do the ministry he cut out for them as his disciples and
[1370.00 → 1376.96] here's the question I have why would john tell this story last John's such a masterful genius writer i
[1376.96 → 1383.20] really do believe John is a genius why would he save this story for last here's my take I think john
[1383.20 → 1390.48] sees the whole church as peter and the point is so simple peter is broken peter made a mistake and
[1390.48 → 1396.64] Jesus looks at peter he says my grace is sufficient for you peter it is abundant it is sufficient and
[1396.64 → 1402.88] it's enough you have what you need peter you go in my strength and I will do the work in and through
[1402.88 → 1409.36] you, and you'll see me do amazing things you stay faithful you stay in my love and watch what I can
[1409.36 → 1416.72] do my grace is sufficient and I really do believe that's the word for the church today you look back
[1416.72 → 1420.64] to your worst failures you look back to your weakest points in discipleship, and you feel that
[1420.64 → 1425.28] guilt of saying this is not me I don't know if I have what it takes and Jesus says to the church do
[1425.28 → 1430.96] you love me my grace is sufficient it's abundant in your places of need and I've got work for you to
[1430.96 → 1438.48] do for the kingdom I am enough do you believe that not just for peter and not just for the disciples
[1438.48 → 1445.60] then but for you in all of your weakness in all of your patterns of sin it's the same Jesus who shows up
[1445.60 → 1453.04] for us that shows up for peter and the good news is he's got work for us to do, and the grave is empty
[1453.04 → 1460.40] and we're sent in his love I want to finish with what I think is the most appropriate passage in john to
[1460.40 → 1467.04] finish with it is what I believe to be the theme passage of this entire gospel account, and so I will read it for us
[1469.36 → 1474.64] Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples remember the books can't even contain all of them
[1474.64 → 1482.64] which are not recorded in this book, but this john writes are written so that you may believe that
[1482.64 → 1490.32] Jesus is the messiah the son of god and that by believing you may have life in his name and church
[1490.32 → 1497.52] let me finish with this choose that life let's pray
[1497.52 → 1508.24] father I give you thanks for this gospel account thank you for inspiring John's words and for the
[1508.24 → 1514.96] gift it is to the church today and I pray that we would live into this story that we would receive
[1514.96 → 1519.84] your forgiveness that we would receive your commission to us today and that we would go not
[1519.84 → 1527.76] in our own strength but in your strength and your sufficiency and your grace use us to make your name
[1527.76 → 1535.12] known use us to bless our city, and we pray lord that we would be faithful to the task you've given us
[1535.12 → 1541.84] to you be the glory amen
