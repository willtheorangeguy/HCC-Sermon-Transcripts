[0.44 → 6.06] Well, we've had this tradition over the last few weeks that we're interviewing people about their journey of faith
[6.06 → 9.86] as we looked at the Gospel of John and this way in which Jesus invites us to believe.
[10.06 → 13.12] And this morning, I'm going to invite one of our young adults, Peter Eisen man Jr.
[13.54 → 15.82] And so, Peter, I invite you up to share your story.
[23.82 → 26.66] You can see the generational difference between the interview I did last week.
[26.66 → 30.18] Sonia had printed paper. Peter has his phone, right? There you go.
[30.58 → 35.68] This interview is also different, and I'm excited about this because so far we've interviewed people who came to faith later in life,
[36.06 → 39.84] two of whom from different religions and totally different backgrounds, but Peter grew up in this church.
[40.48 → 46.76] His parents are right there. And so, you can talk about your life. Tell us a bit about your family and your story.
[47.50 → 54.50] Yeah, so my name is Peter Eisen man. For those of you who don't know me, my parents are Pete and Melanie sitting right there.
[54.50 → 57.90] If you know them, then yeah.
[58.46 → 65.12] We went to Fleetwood CRC starting out and everything like that when I was really, really young.
[65.86 → 71.52] And then at about, I think, grade four or so, maybe 10 or 11 years ago for me,
[71.76 → 77.14] my parents moved us to here in Hope Community at Ladder Road Elementary.
[77.14 → 83.16] I wasn't excited about the move at first when I was in grade four because all my friends were in Fleetwood CRC,
[83.50 → 85.70] but I can say now that I'm pretty glad that I'm here.
[88.36 → 93.58] And yeah, no, I work for my dad's company, so that's where you can find me landscaping,
[93.74 → 97.12] Monday to Fridays from 8 to 4.30 if you ever need me.
[97.48 → 99.64] Don't know if you ever will, but that's okay.
[100.78 → 103.76] Did your dad ask you to make that plug for the company? Like seriously?
[103.76 → 107.30] I'm trying to get some more quotes and stuff like that, so you know, it's whatever.
[108.26 → 113.30] Well, I'm intrigued by this question because for a lot of people, there's a time that they say,
[113.44 → 116.58] here's when I became a Christian. You grew up in a Christian family, you grew up in the church.
[116.66 → 117.92] When would you say you became a Christian?
[118.48 → 122.82] Yeah, so I grew up as a Christian. I went to Sunday school, you know.
[123.20 → 128.90] My parents raised me in their home as a Christian, and I grew up in faith and everything like that.
[128.90 → 136.86] I can't say that I truly was a Christian until last year, back in October, I'd say,
[137.02 → 139.86] where it kind of made the change, Septembers as well.
[140.58 → 148.78] I ended up going after high school. I went into a gap year, and then throughout that gap year,
[148.90 → 151.74] I wasn't sure what I was doing. You know, my faith wasn't strong.
[151.74 → 158.18] And I decided through a friend, she showed me Prairie College out in Three Hills, Alberta.
[159.02 → 163.40] So I ended up looking and everything like that. I'm like, oh, I'm not sure about this.
[163.46 → 166.34] So I ended up going to Prairie College, actually, in the end.
[166.80 → 170.26] Made a commitment in April 2020 to go.
[170.94 → 174.28] And then in September, I, yeah, just decided to go.
[174.28 → 178.32] I met a crazy amount of, like, faithful people there.
[178.42 → 183.20] Like, it was community. Like, it was crazy cool going over there.
[183.48 → 185.40] And, yeah, so amazing community.
[185.80 → 188.70] And, yeah, so I started learning about faith more.
[188.92 → 192.88] I started kind of working my way back to God at that time.
[193.18 → 195.62] And, yeah, so I remember one night.
[196.42 → 200.46] I don't know if it was really one night, but it was kind of over a period of time as well.
[200.46 → 207.82] But one night, I was doing my nightly prayer walks out in cold Alberta winter, or fall even.
[208.32 → 210.34] It was negative 18 degrees. I remember that night.
[211.12 → 214.20] I was walking across the street from Waffles on Main.
[214.34 → 217.26] So I don't know if it was the waffle smell or if it was the cold air.
[217.92 → 222.74] But I remember just going on these walks and just talking to God
[222.74 → 226.78] and just opening up about everything that was, like, had happened in my life
[226.78 → 230.86] and was happening in my life and my sin and my struggles and everything like that.
[231.04 → 235.72] So I ended up just, I don't know, just kind of collapsing on the ground almost
[235.72 → 239.30] and just pretty much repenting of my sin that night.
[239.60 → 240.48] You know, I was bawling.
[240.64 → 244.16] I was, like, yeah, just crying my eyes out that night
[244.16 → 247.90] because I realized that I was so broken, and I needed Christ in my life.
[248.14 → 250.84] And, yeah, so I'd say that was the night that I kind of,
[251.16 → 252.82] I don't know, remember what date it was,
[252.82 → 255.30] but I remember that night pretty vividly.
[255.84 → 258.80] And, yeah, no, so I'd say that was the night where I really just repented
[258.80 → 261.64] of everything that I had done.
[262.46 → 263.24] Yeah, so.
[263.80 → 265.42] I mean, you join Christians throughout history
[265.42 → 268.88] in the sense of conversion is shaped by the sense of, like,
[268.98 → 272.08] wow, my life's a mess and I need to bring that to the Lord.
[274.22 → 276.76] I've asked this question differently, but I want to frame it this way for you.
[276.82 → 278.48] For a lot of people who grew up in the church,
[278.48 → 283.20] you kind of know things, and then you often go through a season of saying,
[283.30 → 284.58] okay, I've learned the Bible.
[284.68 → 285.82] My parents read it to me as a kid.
[285.90 → 286.60] I grew up with prayer.
[286.98 → 287.68] But is it mine?
[287.72 → 290.72] And there's often a struggle with, like, okay, this is what I've received.
[290.78 → 291.40] Is it mine?
[291.92 → 294.60] Talk to me a little bit or talk to us a little bit about the struggle
[294.60 → 297.52] of sort of finding your way back to God, as you put it.
[298.02 → 298.26] Right.
[298.46 → 303.80] Yeah, so pretty much my biggest struggle was probably just my doubt.
[303.80 → 310.40] But in grade 8, I started to develop depression and it kind of took control of my life
[310.40 → 317.58] where I started looking for other ways instead of God to kind of balance that
[317.58 → 318.90] or try to make myself happier.
[319.26 → 321.74] So throughout high school and everything like that,
[321.80 → 326.02] I started drinking and going to parties and smoking
[326.02 → 329.00] and doing a lot of that kind of stuff.
[329.00 → 332.88] And, you know, I had some big struggles going throughout high school.
[332.88 → 334.96] And it was terrible.
[335.14 → 340.26] And I just, the depression kind of doubted, like, I doubted my own faith.
[340.70 → 342.54] Like, I doubted in God and everything like that.
[342.62 → 343.82] I had heard the stories.
[344.12 → 345.40] I had grown up in church.
[346.14 → 347.30] And it was great.
[347.44 → 348.98] But did I actually believe?
[349.58 → 352.90] And I could say throughout high school, I definitely did not.
[352.94 → 353.80] And I lost my faith.
[353.98 → 358.62] I still went to church to try and make my parents happy in that way just because.
[358.74 → 361.64] But I was never really fully present when I was there.
[361.64 → 364.64] And, yeah, so I had a lot of doubts.
[364.84 → 367.70] And it was due to depression that kind of brought me there.
[367.92 → 370.40] And I just, yeah, kind of stopped believing in God.
[370.48 → 371.98] And that was kind of the struggle that I had.
[372.22 → 373.56] You know, I knew the church was good.
[373.64 → 374.92] I knew that people were good there.
[375.20 → 377.78] But I just couldn't get over the fact.
[377.94 → 380.40] I was like, is there a guy looking over me right now?
[380.48 → 384.00] Like, is he, like, why does he let this bad stuff happen to me?
[384.00 → 388.38] I didn't have the knowledge to, you know, understand, you know, why this was happening.
[388.96 → 390.72] And, you know, trials that I'd faced.
[392.84 → 394.60] What would you say were some of the key people?
[394.88 → 396.30] I mean, you mentioned going to Prairie.
[396.40 → 401.48] But what were some of the key people and milestones that sort of said, okay, I believe Christ is real.
[401.64 → 402.22] He's my saviour.
[402.70 → 402.90] Yeah.
[402.90 → 409.20] So I think that kind of journey began after high school in September 2019.
[410.48 → 413.38] My depression got really severe at that time.
[413.98 → 416.98] And back at that time, I almost took my own life.
[418.08 → 420.64] And that was, like, a whole story there.
[421.06 → 424.98] And, you know, after that night, I knew I needed to make a change.
[425.06 → 425.98] I was afraid of death.
[426.02 → 426.84] And I didn't do it.
[427.00 → 429.44] And I knew I needed to make a change in my life.
[429.44 → 442.70] And I, you know, started hanging out with my friends less that were from high school that kind of got me into drinking and smoking and all these, you know, things that were kind of destroying my life and not really helping it.
[443.34 → 445.84] And I started hanging out with another friend who was good.
[446.10 → 447.58] Her name was Hannah Weber.
[448.06 → 449.36] She's strong in her faith.
[450.28 → 453.36] And we started hanging out more and everything like that.
[453.36 → 458.64] And she really, like, I started asking her questions more about it because I knew I wanted to make a change.
[458.64 → 460.72] And I knew I needed to make a change throughout that fall.
[461.26 → 463.64] She ended up going to Cape and Ray in England.
[463.96 → 464.98] And it was a Bible school.
[465.10 → 466.36] And I was like, whoa, that's kind of cool.
[467.06 → 470.28] So she, and then I started asking questions about that, Bible school.
[470.46 → 473.02] And then she introduced me to Prairie College.
[474.40 → 478.62] That, you know, she's like, oh, check it out, you know, go find a program that you like.
[479.04 → 480.76] So I ended up finding a program that I liked.
[481.00 → 487.34] And when my mom heard about it, she told me to go to a preview day out of Prairie College.
[487.34 → 489.64] So I decided to go to that preview day.
[490.28 → 494.02] And I ended up really enjoying it, you know, out there.
[494.26 → 495.70] And I, you know, yeah.
[495.88 → 497.44] So I really loved doing that.
[498.42 → 501.44] And, yeah, in April I kind of made that switch and made that change.
[501.56 → 503.26] I was still going through a lot of things.
[503.36 → 505.52] Like I still had depression I was working through.
[505.76 → 511.56] I was still struggling with my unhealthy habits towards alcohol and smoking and all this stuff.
[511.56 → 513.62] And that was still a daily, daily thing.
[514.90 → 517.92] And, you know, so I was still struggling in that time.
[517.96 → 519.22] But I knew I needed to make a change.
[519.32 → 527.12] So I think that was the first step kind of accepting and going to a place where I thought, you know, maybe I could get stronger in my faith.
[527.90 → 529.46] Yet I was unsure at that time.
[529.46 → 538.22] And so throughout that summer, I think last time I ever smoked was May 28, 2020.
[538.68 → 544.20] Last time I drank alcohol was August 25, 2020, before I left for college.
[544.20 → 552.34] So because I wanted to deal with some of the sins that I was going through and some of the things that I struggled with before I went to college.
[552.38 → 556.40] Because I'm like, oh, dang, you know, it's these people here that are going to be strong in their faith.
[556.50 → 560.16] You know, I want to show up and be a good guy, too, you know, and everything like that.
[560.60 → 561.74] And I ended up going.
[562.08 → 565.42] And, yeah, so I met a very strong community, as I had said.
[565.50 → 567.86] And I started working through the struggles that I had.
[567.92 → 569.06] I had a few mentors.
[569.64 → 573.40] Kelly Stephan, one of my props that I met on Wednesdays, that really helped me.
[574.20 → 577.92] Get back on track, talking about things that I was going through.
[578.34 → 580.82] And just the strong community of guys that I met there.
[581.28 → 589.26] You know, some of the names were Luke Murdock, Sam Hetman, Noah Farah, and a bunch of other people, too,
[589.76 → 593.06] who just really, like, yeah, took me under their wing.
[593.06 → 597.38] They knew faith, and I was just, they knew I was struggling, and they helped me.
[597.94 → 601.20] And together we were able to help each other through that.
[601.66 → 603.04] So, yeah.
[603.10 → 604.00] That's one of the other few things.
[604.00 → 609.62] Number one, I really appreciate the way in which you named the struggle that comes after faith.
[609.72 → 611.26] Like, I find there is this unhelpful narrative.
[611.38 → 613.30] It's like, then I became a Christian, and everything was great.
[613.86 → 616.16] And for you, it's like, then I became a Christian, and I had to face the demons.
[616.60 → 618.78] And there's a real story there, and I just appreciate that.
[618.78 → 623.94] I also appreciate the recognition that even mental health and depression is something you have to face even after becoming a Christian.
[623.94 → 629.90] And for me, as having a brother with bipolar, there's a sense in which, yeah, you can be a Christian and really struggle with your mental health.
[629.90 → 633.48] And that doesn't, you know, Jesus doesn't just take mental health problems away by conversion.
[633.48 → 640.94] But I also want to name a consistency that's happened through all these stories so far, people sharing their conversion, is community.
[641.20 → 641.88] With you, it's Hannah.
[642.10 → 643.06] With previous people, it's friends.
[643.06 → 648.70] I'm just struck by how it's often a friend who puts themselves out there to say, hey, I want to be someone you can talk to.
[649.02 → 650.46] I want to be a person you can ask hard questions.
[651.30 → 659.06] And that leads me to the final question that we ask at every interview is, what would you say to Hope Community Church, given your story of coming to faith in Christ,
[659.50 → 663.22] what do you want to tell the church about evangelism and sharing our faith?
[664.24 → 665.60] Yeah, so definitely.
[666.44 → 671.32] So number one thing I'd say is having community and strong friends.
[671.32 → 679.26] But then once you have that, and you have that community, so you have that small group, or you, you know, you just have that group of friends and everything like that,
[679.44 → 683.00] you invite other people that you know who are struggling in their faith into that group.
[683.46 → 685.12] Like, it's such a big thing, right?
[685.26 → 692.76] Like, you know, you might be a little worried or, you know, hesitant to invite them in because you're like, oh, I don't know what they're going to think of me and everything like that.
[692.78 → 697.80] But I think once you get past that fact, and they might be a little bit wary at first.
[697.80 → 699.76] They might be like, oh, I don't know if I want to go in.
[699.76 → 707.30] But if you're persistent with it, you know, like people were to me, you can really bring somebody in and change their whole life around.
[707.86 → 711.42] And, you know, I can certainly say that my whole life was changed.
[712.18 → 718.04] And even afterwards, coming back from school and everything like that, I was a little worried I was going to fall back into the same things.
[718.16 → 721.12] But, you know, Dave, you invited me out to talk about...
[721.12 → 723.40] I took him out for beer after he stopped drinking beer.
[723.56 → 724.52] Yeah, great influence.
[724.72 → 725.30] Great influence.
[725.30 → 726.58] It's okay.
[726.72 → 727.42] I had a drink, guys.
[727.46 → 728.02] Don't worry about it.
[729.86 → 730.72] But, yeah, no.
[730.84 → 733.34] So he invited me out to talk about it, and it really helped.
[733.46 → 735.66] And, you know, he got me into youth ministry here.
[735.90 → 738.98] And, you know, so I'm really thankful for that too.
[739.44 → 741.98] And, you know, I'm still, yeah, going strong.
[742.10 → 743.62] And, yeah, I plan to be.
[743.80 → 746.44] And, you know, yeah, I'm really thankful for that.
[746.44 → 751.84] So I think, yeah, after we get over the fear of what people might think of us when we bring up our faith.
[752.04 → 755.20] And, you know, I mean, faith should be the number one thing, right, in our lives.
[755.28 → 757.60] And why can't we talk about that, you know?
[757.84 → 763.08] And, yeah, so, you know, I just kind of realized that I love these people so much.
[763.12 → 766.64] I wouldn't want them to not go throughout their lives without Christ.
[767.24 → 768.42] And that's why I do it.
[768.50 → 768.72] Amen.
[768.94 → 769.42] I love it.
[769.88 → 772.72] Well, Peter, we just give praise to God for the faith you have.
[772.78 → 774.84] This is a testimony of what Christ has done in your life.
[774.84 → 775.60] And we're so grateful.
[776.28 → 777.16] And your parents are here.
[777.22 → 778.32] And I just want to say it's a gift.
[778.42 → 782.30] I just imagine being a parent here and just thinking, you know, God's been faithful through you too.
[782.48 → 785.92] And we're so thankful, Peter and Mel, for the place you have in our church and in Peter's life.
[786.40 → 789.80] And I also want to say thank you personally because Peter is the small group leader of my own son.
[790.24 → 792.50] And I just know it's strange being a pastor's kid.
[792.60 → 796.72] And I'm just grateful for the mentorship that you have in his life and also many other youth's lives.
[797.00 → 799.36] And I want to just pray for you and your life right now.
[799.40 → 799.98] So let's pray together.
[799.98 → 804.98] Father, we just marvel at the way that you work in all of our lives.
[805.42 → 813.08] The way you plant seeds through family, friends, youth ministry, and the way you bring us through struggles and depression and serious doubt.
[813.68 → 816.44] And even in those moments, you never leave us and you never forsake us.
[816.50 → 819.62] And we thank you for the way that Peter's testimony is one of your faithfulness.
[820.34 → 822.60] It's of your patient, persevering love.
[822.66 → 823.96] And we thank you for his faith.
[823.96 → 829.62] We thank you for the way he has found life in you and for the way you're blessing many people through him.
[830.22 → 837.74] Use his gifts and use our church, Lord, to make the name of Jesus Christ known so that no one goes through life, as Peter said, without Jesus.
[838.26 → 838.46] Amen.
[839.92 → 840.64] Thank you, Peter.
[840.64 → 846.18] Thank you, Nana.
[849.96 → 857.80] Well, you know, now that we're at two services again, I was told by a number of people to shorten my sermon, especially after last week.
[857.84 → 864.90] I don't know if you knew this, but in the back of the sanctuary, Sid's wife, as only a pastor's wife can do, was standing up with her wristwatch, going like this to Sid.
[865.72 → 867.68] And I feel like my wife's going to do that to me today.
[867.68 → 871.00] But we're going to continue our series on the Gospel of John.
[871.24 → 876.60] If you're following along in the reading plan, we're supposed to be on the story of Lazarus, but I'm actually preaching on John 10.
[876.70 → 881.06] I just couldn't preach on John 10, where Jesus speaks of being the good shepherd.
[881.90 → 884.36] So we'll do John 11 next week as we being Lent.
[884.44 → 887.18] But this morning, if you have your Bible, turn with me to John 10.
[892.66 → 895.02] This is the good shepherd and his sheep.
[895.02 → 897.84] And Jesus says,
[897.84 → 907.08] Very truly, I tell you, Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way is a thief and a robber.
[907.74 → 910.30] The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
[910.94 → 914.32] The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice.
[915.00 → 917.96] He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
[918.82 → 923.66] When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
[923.66 → 925.92] But they will never follow a stranger.
[926.52 → 930.64] In fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice.
[931.94 → 935.80] Jesus uses figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them.
[936.34 → 937.46] Therefore, Jesus said again,
[937.76 → 940.42] Very truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.
[941.16 → 945.18] All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them.
[945.96 → 947.00] I am the gate.
[947.54 → 949.38] Whoever enters through me will be saved.
[949.86 → 952.36] They will come in and go out and find pasture.
[952.36 → 956.14] The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.
[956.38 → 960.62] I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.
[961.82 → 963.08] I am the good shepherd.
[963.66 → 966.54] The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[967.32 → 970.16] The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep.
[970.44 → 973.68] So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away.
[974.26 → 976.44] Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.
[976.72 → 980.60] The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
[980.60 → 982.74] I am the good shepherd.
[983.62 → 986.34] I know my sheep and my sheep know me.
[986.76 → 992.36] Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father and I lay my life down for the sheep.
[993.12 → 995.66] I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen.
[996.22 → 997.84] I must bring them also.
[997.98 → 1001.88] They too will listen to my voice and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.
[1001.88 → 1007.50] The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life only to take it up again.
[1008.36 → 1011.48] No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.
[1011.86 → 1015.76] I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again.
[1016.32 → 1018.26] This command I receive from my Father.
[1019.60 → 1021.92] The Jews who heard this word were again divided.
[1022.58 → 1025.60] Many of them said, he's a demon possessed and raving mad.
[1026.24 → 1027.20] Why listen to him?
[1028.06 → 1031.68] But others said, these are not sayings of someone possessed by a demon.
[1032.34 → 1034.68] Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
[1035.90 → 1037.38] So far the reading of God's word.
[1039.90 → 1042.84] Over the past few years I've had the privilege, and I do mean privilege,
[1043.48 → 1047.24] of leading a number of funerals and memorials for people in our church and in our city.
[1047.24 → 1051.80] And I consider it a privilege to be with people in their grief and to even be with loved ones
[1051.80 → 1055.76] or people who have lost loved ones and work through what we're going to do in that funeral.
[1055.84 → 1059.16] How we're going to honour the person, the parent, the friend they loved.
[1059.62 → 1062.58] And it's often when I meet with them to plan the funeral that I hear the stories.
[1063.18 → 1064.94] I hear how they want that person to be remembered.
[1065.04 → 1066.72] How they want that parent to be spoken of.
[1066.82 → 1069.30] Words they want to be said and the loved ones who get to speak.
[1069.30 → 1073.42] And it's in those meetings where we plan the funeral that I will often say,
[1074.22 → 1077.64] what scripture can we read at this funeral?
[1078.64 → 1082.24] And 95% of the time, which one do you think they give me?
[1083.86 → 1084.74] Psalm 23.
[1085.86 → 1088.20] The Lord is my shepherd.
[1089.28 → 1093.28] In fact, I had an experience not that long ago where I was doing a funeral for a family in our community,
[1093.64 → 1096.68] not a Christian family, not particularly interested even in a Christian funeral,
[1096.68 → 1100.10] and they originally said to me, they don't want any scripture in their funeral.
[1100.20 → 1102.44] I'm like, well, then maybe you don't need a pastor to leave this one.
[1102.86 → 1106.92] And I said, can I read one for you, and you can let me know if you want this read at the funeral.
[1107.02 → 1109.28] And I pulled in my Bible and I read Psalm 23.
[1109.54 → 1112.94] And after I finished reading it, the woman sitting in my office, she had tears in her eyes.
[1112.98 → 1113.84] And she said, you know what?
[1114.16 → 1115.90] I do want you to read that passage.
[1116.48 → 1118.72] I do want that to be spoken at my father's funeral.
[1120.06 → 1124.78] There's something about Psalm 23 that hits us in deep places.
[1125.18 → 1126.12] And it hits us in deep places.
[1126.12 → 1156.10] It hits us in deep places.
[1156.10 → 1160.46] Because we all, in my opinion, have this created longing to be led.
[1161.74 → 1168.80] This deep gut sense of letting someone who's good lead our lives.
[1169.68 → 1173.66] And I think we have a deep longing that Western people don't even know how to talk about,
[1173.88 → 1180.04] that we simply don't want to be stuck running the show of our own lives.
[1180.04 → 1181.78] We want to be led.
[1182.56 → 1188.46] And Jesus, who has this psalm memorized, along with the entire Psalter, all 150 of them,
[1188.68 → 1193.20] he stands up, he's speaking to Pharisees, and knowing exactly what he's saying, he says to them,
[1193.20 → 1196.78] I am the good shepherd.
[1197.56 → 1199.72] My sheep know my voice.
[1199.72 → 1202.30] I will lead them by name.
[1202.62 → 1204.48] I will provide for them.
[1204.68 → 1206.48] I will be their protector.
[1206.68 → 1210.16] And I will lay my life down for them.
[1211.12 → 1214.76] In this passage, Jesus is doing what we see him doing throughout the Gospel of John.
[1214.84 → 1216.02] He's revealing his identity.
[1216.18 → 1220.60] He's giving them image after image so they know who he is.
[1221.00 → 1222.52] They know his good character.
[1222.64 → 1229.78] And in this passage, that they begin to see what he's going to do for his flock, for his world.
[1230.72 → 1234.02] And again, you probably noticed as I read it, there's two very significant I am statements.
[1234.16 → 1235.94] Number one, Jesus is the good shepherd.
[1236.06 → 1238.78] But number two, Jesus is I am the gate.
[1239.12 → 1242.50] And we're going to open up both of those this morning as we work through John 10 together.
[1244.40 → 1247.10] Now, I need to point out probably something that's obvious to all of us,
[1247.16 → 1250.74] and that is Jesus always speaks contextually, like very contextually.
[1250.74 → 1252.86] If he's speaking to us, I actually wondered to myself,
[1252.98 → 1257.28] if Jesus was speaking this passage to us today, I'm curious what images he would use,
[1257.32 → 1259.36] because I'm certain he would not use the image of his shepherd.
[1260.24 → 1262.52] You know, just a few weeks ago, I was walking with someone in Clayton Park,
[1262.62 → 1263.62] and there was a cow there.
[1264.08 → 1265.46] I have no idea how it got there.
[1265.50 → 1268.70] But what was interesting to me is, like, hundreds of people took photos of the cow,
[1269.04 → 1272.42] posted that picture on social media, because nobody knew what to do with the cow,
[1272.56 → 1274.66] because we live in Clayton, and we are not farmers.
[1275.28 → 1277.88] I'm curious what image Jesus would use for us today.
[1278.46 → 1281.50] But there, everybody knew what farming was about.
[1281.90 → 1285.36] Pharisees understood this image, and everyone would have understood the nuances of the sheep,
[1285.48 → 1287.78] and the gate, and the thieves, and the robbers, and all.
[1287.86 → 1289.22] That all made sense to them.
[1289.22 → 1290.86] But it's not entirely clear to us.
[1290.94 → 1293.50] And so what I want to do today, in some sense, is pull out some of these nuances
[1293.50 → 1297.60] that we just don't naturally see, because we're not farmers, and we don't know shepherds.
[1298.84 → 1302.54] Now, one of the interesting things to me is that, underneath this whole passage,
[1303.26 → 1305.90] Jesus assumes a lot about sheep.
[1306.30 → 1308.82] And he assumes a lot about shepherds that we don't know.
[1308.82 → 1315.38] And one of those fundamental assumptions is that sheep desperately need a shepherd.
[1316.88 → 1318.98] Now, I happen to have grown up on a sheep farm.
[1319.12 → 1320.12] I don't know if I've mentioned that before.
[1320.20 → 1324.26] So I actually have a fairly significant first-hand knowledge of shepherds,
[1324.38 → 1325.66] or not shepherds, I should say of sheep.
[1326.34 → 1329.12] And it's true what people say about sheep, that they are dumb.
[1329.64 → 1330.58] You know, that's the stereotype.
[1330.78 → 1332.14] It's true that they are defenseless.
[1332.28 → 1333.02] That's very true.
[1333.06 → 1334.40] And it's true that they're prone to wander.
[1335.10 → 1336.62] And I can give lots of examples of those.
[1336.72 → 1338.70] Like, you know, I grew up on a 100-acre farm.
[1338.84 → 1340.96] There are tons of land for these sheep to graze on.
[1341.12 → 1344.76] And they just had this propensity to, like, break down the one fence to our neighbour's house
[1344.76 → 1346.34] and, like, just eat all of his grass.
[1346.60 → 1348.32] And, like, one sheep would do that, and the rest would just be like,
[1348.36 → 1349.22] hey, what's going on over here?
[1349.24 → 1350.92] And all the sheep are in our neighbour's yard.
[1351.42 → 1352.16] He didn't like that.
[1352.68 → 1354.54] And so my dad would have to come and get them out of there.
[1355.30 → 1356.86] And they're also weak and defenseless.
[1356.86 → 1361.50] I mean, I have memories of my dad pulling out the gun and killing wild animals, wolves,
[1361.50 → 1365.68] so they wouldn't kill sheep, or after they would kill sheep, he would have to go and kill them.
[1365.94 → 1369.58] And if you're a silly person, that might be an offensive thing to say, but that's how it goes on farms.
[1370.18 → 1373.72] And for wolves, they look at sheep as just like a fluffy piece of meat.
[1374.12 → 1375.36] They cannot defend themselves.
[1375.48 → 1378.16] They are so vulnerable, and so they need to be protected.
[1379.28 → 1381.02] And don't let this wash over you.
[1381.60 → 1384.54] Jesus picks the image of sheep to describe us, right?
[1385.42 → 1389.88] Vulnerable, weak, defenseless, and wandering.
[1389.88 → 1393.86] In fact, I texted my dad saying, Dad, you know, you were a farmer for a long time of sheep.
[1393.92 → 1394.48] What would you say?
[1394.54 → 1396.80] And the first thing he said is they're prone to wander,
[1397.38 → 1400.84] because that's the first annoyance he always had to deal with the sheep.
[1401.24 → 1402.88] But Jesus is saying, that's us.
[1402.98 → 1404.22] That's the human condition.
[1404.42 → 1405.44] That's the nature of sheep.
[1405.68 → 1406.92] You need a shepherd.
[1407.20 → 1407.86] That's the assumption.
[1408.12 → 1410.92] And the Pharisees, listening to Jesus, they got that.
[1411.68 → 1414.28] And I would say a lot of people in Jesus' time understood that,
[1414.34 → 1415.92] but I'm not sure if we believe that.
[1415.92 → 1418.74] I think functionally, most Western Christians are like,
[1419.32 → 1422.34] well, you know, I can control most of my life, and it's going to be okay.
[1422.70 → 1424.08] And certainly, if you grow up in Canada,
[1424.22 → 1428.88] you grow up in a culture where the wisdom of the day is trust your instincts.
[1429.68 → 1431.32] Do what's right for you.
[1432.00 → 1434.04] Follow your heart, right?
[1434.10 → 1435.54] Or be true to yourself.
[1436.08 → 1438.66] That's like the slogan right now, be true to yourself.
[1438.84 → 1440.42] And there's some insight into it,
[1440.42 → 1443.28] but I think it leads us to a place of saying,
[1443.40 → 1444.28] well, I don't need a shepherd.
[1445.14 → 1446.42] I'm not a wandering sheep.
[1446.50 → 1447.52] I'll run the show here.
[1447.58 → 1449.72] I don't need someone who's leading and guiding and speaking to me
[1449.72 → 1450.94] that I have to listen to.
[1452.28 → 1455.44] Interestingly, this week, actually not this week, last week,
[1455.72 → 1457.24] I was reading about that phrase,
[1457.32 → 1459.32] be true to your heart, or be true to yourself.
[1459.80 → 1461.48] And I discovered, to my own interest,
[1461.56 → 1464.44] that it actually comes from a long time ago from Shakespeare.
[1464.96 → 1465.64] Did you know that?
[1465.64 → 1468.22] And the original line, very Shakespearean, is,
[1468.58 → 1470.64] above all else, to thine own heart be true.
[1470.80 → 1472.00] Now, that sounds a lot like Shakespeare.
[1472.60 → 1474.40] Now, here's the fascinating thing.
[1474.46 → 1475.52] Do you know which play it comes from?
[1475.64 → 1476.70] Anyone a Shakespeare buff here?
[1477.44 → 1480.66] It comes from Hamlet, which is a tragedy.
[1481.26 → 1482.00] First important point.
[1482.26 → 1484.02] Do you know, secondly, who speaks it?
[1484.66 → 1486.22] A character named Polonius.
[1487.10 → 1490.06] Guess what role Polonius plays in Hamlet.
[1491.68 → 1492.52] He's the fool.
[1494.28 → 1495.52] Polonius is the fool.
[1495.98 → 1498.48] And the line that the fool gets in Shakespeare is,
[1498.64 → 1500.70] above all else, be true to thine own heart.
[1501.54 → 1504.92] And Shakespeare would, like, roll over in his grave
[1504.92 → 1507.10] if he knew that Western people in Canada are like,
[1507.18 → 1508.44] hey, be true to yourself.
[1508.52 → 1509.18] He's like, what?
[1509.54 → 1511.16] That's what the fool says.
[1512.02 → 1513.16] Seriously, think about that.
[1513.22 → 1516.18] The wisdom of our day was, to Shakespeare, foolish.
[1517.28 → 1519.94] And there is something painful about that reality.
[1520.36 → 1522.78] And what Shakespeare knew, what people all over the world know,
[1522.78 → 1525.66] is being true to yourself is a dangerous place to be
[1525.66 → 1527.78] because we desire many things.
[1528.28 → 1530.76] Some good, but some terrible.
[1531.00 → 1533.46] And even some of Peter's own story illustrates that point.
[1533.62 → 1535.14] My own story illustrates that point.
[1535.46 → 1537.02] I think if you were honest with yourself
[1537.02 → 1539.52] and you looked at some of the worst decisions you made,
[1539.78 → 1542.92] those were moments where you thought you were being true to yourself.
[1542.92 → 1544.96] Those were moments where you're like, you know what?
[1544.98 → 1546.98] I'm going to do what the heart desires.
[1547.38 → 1548.32] How'd that go for you?
[1549.46 → 1552.18] And Jesus' point underneath this whole story is,
[1552.38 → 1559.00] we are sheep wandering, vulnerable, weak, needing a shepherd.
[1559.78 → 1561.06] And I think as Western people today,
[1561.14 → 1562.86] I can't preach this without highlighting that
[1562.86 → 1565.32] we really need to see this and hear it.
[1565.32 → 1566.40] And what Jesus is saying is,
[1566.54 → 1570.14] unless you listen to the voice of the shepherd,
[1570.52 → 1573.48] unless you're willing to obey his leading and follow in his way,
[1573.56 → 1577.20] you will not experience the abundant life that Jesus promises.
[1577.90 → 1579.34] You will not find it on your own.
[1579.42 → 1581.30] You don't just find your own pasture, and it's going to be great.
[1581.36 → 1583.40] It's only by listening to, obeying,
[1583.56 → 1585.02] and heeding the voice of the good shepherd
[1585.02 → 1588.82] that you find the abundant life of Christ.
[1588.82 → 1592.24] Now, equally significant to me
[1592.24 → 1594.02] is that Jesus takes on the image of a shepherd.
[1594.20 → 1596.48] And there's a lot of people who've done research on shepherds
[1596.48 → 1598.84] that say there's just so many dimensions to this
[1598.84 → 1600.26] that are powerful and beautiful.
[1600.84 → 1603.06] I mean, Jesus knows his sheep by name.
[1604.02 → 1605.24] He leads his sheep.
[1605.54 → 1607.16] He speaks to his sheep.
[1607.52 → 1608.70] And they hear his voice.
[1608.84 → 1610.06] I mean, Jesus is saying, that's true of me.
[1610.74 → 1613.00] Of course, more than that, he protects his sheep.
[1613.40 → 1615.88] And there's a lot of literature about how shepherds did that
[1615.88 → 1616.78] in pretty remarkable ways.
[1616.78 → 1618.44] He provides for his sheep.
[1619.36 → 1620.68] And one of the most interesting things for me
[1620.68 → 1622.78] in reading some scholarship on shepherds
[1622.78 → 1623.60] in the ancient Near East,
[1624.08 → 1625.22] riveting reading, by the way,
[1625.52 → 1627.68] is that that job was dangerous.
[1629.18 → 1630.54] Shepherding was dangerous.
[1631.10 → 1632.12] I mean, they had to fight off people
[1632.12 → 1633.12] who'd want to steal the sheep.
[1633.38 → 1634.50] They had to fight off wild animals
[1634.50 → 1635.60] who'd try to kill the sheep.
[1635.74 → 1637.26] And they put themselves at great risk,
[1637.42 → 1639.40] great danger all the time.
[1639.58 → 1643.00] And Jesus says, I am the good shepherd.
[1645.68 → 1647.58] Now, this passage, I think historically,
[1647.58 → 1649.62] is known to be a high comfort passage.
[1649.72 → 1651.12] And I think there are a lot of dimensions of it
[1651.12 → 1653.36] that are profoundly encouraging and comforting.
[1654.16 → 1655.32] But as I study it this week,
[1655.36 → 1656.90] I have to say it's also very challenging.
[1657.04 → 1658.68] I think there's just sharp edges to it,
[1658.70 → 1660.30] at least as it speaks into our context,
[1660.44 → 1661.44] that we're going to open up together.
[1662.02 → 1664.44] Jesus makes strong statements and strong contrasts.
[1665.18 → 1665.98] You know, some of the contrasts are,
[1666.04 → 1666.78] he's the good shepherd.
[1667.22 → 1668.66] And there are thieves and robbers.
[1668.88 → 1669.72] He's the good shepherd.
[1669.72 → 1671.86] And there are weak, fake,
[1672.32 → 1673.92] untrustworthy hired hands.
[1674.68 → 1676.44] But the first strong statement Jesus makes
[1676.44 → 1677.46] is not about him being a shepherd,
[1677.58 → 1679.00] it's about him being a gate.
[1679.46 → 1680.40] He says in verse 7,
[1680.50 → 1681.88] Very truly I tell you,
[1682.22 → 1684.50] I am the gate for the sheep.
[1685.22 → 1686.94] And if you're an English buff reading this passage,
[1687.04 → 1687.36] you're thinking,
[1687.48 → 1689.08] okay, Jesus, you can't be a shepherd and a gate.
[1689.18 → 1690.08] You're mixing your metaphors.
[1690.16 → 1690.90] But he doesn't care.
[1691.30 → 1692.22] He's okay with that.
[1692.90 → 1693.92] And there's a fair bit of discussion
[1693.92 → 1695.26] about what Jesus even means
[1695.26 → 1697.02] when he says he's the gate.
[1697.02 → 1699.04] And I want you to imagine
[1699.04 → 1701.22] a giant pasture
[1701.22 → 1703.60] and also a sheep pen.
[1704.10 → 1705.30] And I want you to recognize that
[1705.30 → 1706.82] in most places
[1706.82 → 1708.46] where they're doing shepherding at that time,
[1708.52 → 1710.04] there's always one gate.
[1710.52 → 1711.52] There's only one way
[1711.52 → 1712.84] that sheep get from the pasture
[1712.84 → 1714.36] into the pen and vice versa.
[1715.08 → 1717.14] And Jesus wants to be just abundantly clear.
[1717.20 → 1717.44] He says,
[1717.64 → 1719.06] I am the gate.
[1719.66 → 1722.02] The only way in to the pasture
[1722.02 → 1723.48] and from the pasture to the pen
[1723.48 → 1724.74] is through me.
[1724.74 → 1726.88] Any other way
[1726.88 → 1727.66] is through a thief
[1727.66 → 1729.12] or a robber
[1729.12 → 1730.72] or it's an attack.
[1731.52 → 1732.50] And here's an interesting verse.
[1732.56 → 1733.52] I want to read this in context.
[1733.72 → 1734.30] In verse 8,
[1734.56 → 1734.90] he says,
[1735.16 → 1736.66] those who have come before me
[1736.66 → 1738.42] are thieves and robbers
[1738.42 → 1740.36] and the sheep did not listen to their voice.
[1740.70 → 1741.80] And what Jesus is referencing,
[1742.06 → 1742.88] if you're new to the church,
[1742.98 → 1743.66] this might be interesting
[1743.66 → 1744.90] or new to you,
[1745.20 → 1746.48] is that before Jesus came
[1746.48 → 1747.44] and said he was the Messiah,
[1747.72 → 1749.20] before he made claims about his identity,
[1749.48 → 1750.32] there were a lot of people
[1750.32 → 1751.16] who did the same thing.
[1751.30 → 1751.82] Did you know that?
[1752.58 → 1753.20] There were people
[1753.20 → 1754.72] who rose up a crowd
[1754.72 → 1755.00] and said,
[1755.12 → 1756.94] hey, I'm the messenger from God.
[1757.60 → 1758.82] I am the Messiah.
[1759.34 → 1759.86] Follow me.
[1759.92 → 1760.92] We're going to start a little army.
[1761.04 → 1761.94] We're going to go into Jerusalem.
[1762.04 → 1763.08] We're going to defeat the Romans.
[1763.16 → 1765.00] We're going to reestablish the Jewish people.
[1765.50 → 1765.76] In fact,
[1765.82 → 1766.56] there's also stories
[1766.56 → 1767.48] of triumphal entries.
[1767.60 → 1767.68] You know,
[1767.74 → 1768.54] Jesus comes in
[1768.54 → 1769.76] to Jerusalem on a donkey.
[1770.02 → 1770.52] There were people
[1770.52 → 1771.58] who did it before Jesus
[1771.58 → 1772.82] on horses with swords
[1772.82 → 1773.14] saying,
[1773.52 → 1774.38] this is the time.
[1774.62 → 1775.14] It's come.
[1775.20 → 1776.26] We're going to establish the kingdom.
[1776.58 → 1777.52] And they were killed,
[1778.42 → 1778.84] crucified,
[1779.16 → 1780.42] in the same way that Jesus was.
[1781.14 → 1782.12] And we realize that Jesus is saying,
[1782.42 → 1783.70] those people made false claims.
[1784.50 → 1785.22] And since Jesus,
[1785.34 → 1786.82] people continue to make false claims,
[1787.14 → 1787.92] messianic claims.
[1787.98 → 1788.28] And he says,
[1788.76 → 1791.36] I am the gate.
[1792.08 → 1793.28] I'm the real deal.
[1793.70 → 1795.02] You come through me
[1795.02 → 1796.24] and you get saved,
[1796.30 → 1797.20] as he says himself.
[1797.28 → 1798.12] You come through me
[1798.12 → 1800.10] and you get the abundant life
[1800.10 → 1800.72] of the Father.
[1800.82 → 1801.74] There's one door,
[1802.50 → 1803.26] one gate,
[1803.64 → 1804.96] one way for salvation,
[1804.96 → 1805.68] and that's through Jesus.
[1806.68 → 1807.56] And I want to say,
[1807.70 → 1808.36] I realize,
[1808.56 → 1809.26] speaking here
[1809.26 → 1810.38] in post-Christian,
[1810.86 → 1812.06] pluralistic British Columbia,
[1812.22 → 1813.68] this is a hard edge to it.
[1813.78 → 1813.90] Right?
[1814.44 → 1815.34] Because we live in a culture
[1815.34 → 1815.70] where it's like,
[1815.74 → 1816.98] you can just like mix and match
[1816.98 → 1817.56] your spirituality.
[1817.92 → 1818.28] You can like,
[1818.48 → 1819.04] take a bit of this,
[1819.12 → 1819.60] take a bit of that,
[1819.70 → 1820.34] smash it together
[1820.34 → 1821.38] and you've got your spirituality.
[1821.66 → 1822.26] A little bit of Buddha,
[1822.42 → 1822.96] a little bit of Hindu,
[1823.10 → 1823.76] a little bit of Jesus.
[1823.98 → 1824.68] It all works.
[1825.12 → 1826.12] And Jesus is saying,
[1826.90 → 1827.82] I'm the gate.
[1829.26 → 1830.72] There is no other way
[1830.72 → 1831.50] to salvation
[1831.50 → 1833.02] except through me.
[1833.02 → 1836.34] And it was a strong statement then
[1836.34 → 1837.72] in the same way it is now.
[1838.34 → 1838.48] You know,
[1838.52 → 1839.56] the Roman world at that time
[1839.56 → 1840.68] was very pluralistic.
[1840.80 → 1842.28] There's lots of spirituality around
[1842.28 → 1843.16] and Jesus would have been
[1843.16 → 1844.22] just as hard edged then.
[1844.30 → 1844.52] He's like,
[1844.62 → 1846.20] I am the gate.
[1846.56 → 1847.82] I am the way to the Father.
[1847.88 → 1849.06] If you want the abundant life
[1849.06 → 1849.82] you're created for,
[1849.90 → 1851.62] it comes through me,
[1852.58 → 1853.30] the good shepherd.
[1855.20 → 1856.14] That's how it works.
[1856.32 → 1857.44] And I should just say personally,
[1857.70 → 1858.74] if that's not true,
[1858.82 → 1860.20] I don't know if I want to be a pastor.
[1860.20 → 1862.18] I would have some big questions
[1862.18 → 1863.06] about my vocation
[1863.06 → 1864.88] and about the purpose of the church
[1864.88 → 1868.60] if Jesus is just one gate of 50.
[1869.22 → 1870.96] Or if he's just one option among many
[1870.96 → 1872.34] that might do a little bit of benefit
[1872.34 → 1873.02] for your life.
[1873.50 → 1875.24] If what Jesus is saying is not true,
[1875.46 → 1876.56] I'd have some big questions
[1876.56 → 1877.48] about what I'm doing
[1877.48 → 1878.86] with my own life right now.
[1881.42 → 1882.56] And then comes
[1882.56 → 1885.80] the second strong statement Jesus makes.
[1885.94 → 1887.06] He says in verse 11,
[1887.20 → 1888.88] he repeats this in verse 11 and 14,
[1889.00 → 1889.12] he says,
[1889.12 → 1890.02] I'm the good shepherd.
[1890.20 → 1891.00] I want to read for you.
[1891.06 → 1891.98] I think we have on the screen
[1891.98 → 1893.56] verse 11 and following.
[1893.70 → 1893.94] He says,
[1894.06 → 1895.00] I'm the good shepherd.
[1896.28 → 1897.98] The good shepherd lays down
[1897.98 → 1899.46] his life for the sheep.
[1900.26 → 1901.92] The hired hand is not the shepherd
[1901.92 → 1903.20] and does not own the sheep.
[1903.58 → 1904.78] When he sees the wolf coming,
[1904.86 → 1906.00] he abandons the sheep
[1906.00 → 1906.70] and runs away.
[1907.28 → 1908.06] The man runs away
[1908.06 → 1909.08] because he is a hired hand
[1909.08 → 1911.28] and cares nothing for the sheep.
[1912.48 → 1913.54] Now Jesus is picking up here
[1913.54 → 1914.56] on a very common problem
[1914.56 → 1915.46] that shepherds face,
[1915.52 → 1916.48] and I think a lot of us face.
[1916.64 → 1916.78] You know,
[1916.84 → 1917.68] if you want something done right,
[1917.68 → 1918.36] you do it yourself.
[1918.94 → 1919.32] Shepherds,
[1919.36 → 1920.34] when they hired out their work
[1920.34 → 1921.04] to a hired hand,
[1921.10 → 1922.24] maybe they had other responsibilities,
[1922.66 → 1923.88] they could not trust
[1923.88 → 1924.42] a hired hand
[1924.42 → 1925.74] to do what they needed to do
[1925.74 → 1926.56] if risk came.
[1926.94 → 1927.82] If a wolf attacked
[1927.82 → 1928.60] or thieves came,
[1928.80 → 1930.14] that hired hand was out of there,
[1930.22 → 1930.46] right?
[1931.12 → 1932.18] It's like the stereotype
[1932.18 → 1933.68] of the mall security.
[1934.78 → 1935.36] Mall security,
[1935.58 → 1936.26] they don't have guns,
[1936.36 → 1936.96] and so they're like,
[1937.34 → 1938.48] if something really goes down
[1938.48 → 1938.96] in this mall,
[1939.06 → 1939.32] I'm like,
[1939.38 → 1939.98] I'm out of here.
[1939.98 → 1942.18] That's how it was
[1942.18 → 1942.82] with the hired hand,
[1942.90 → 1944.60] and Jesus wants to be clear.
[1945.96 → 1947.90] That's true of those other people,
[1948.28 → 1949.80] but it's not true of me.
[1950.60 → 1951.26] And here's where we get
[1951.26 → 1951.92] to some deep,
[1952.10 → 1952.88] significant parts
[1952.88 → 1953.64] of Jesus' ministry
[1953.64 → 1954.42] and where he's going.
[1954.48 → 1954.72] He says,
[1954.82 → 1956.14] when the risk comes to me,
[1956.36 → 1957.86] when the threat comes to my flock,
[1958.00 → 1959.78] I will not run.
[1960.64 → 1963.52] I will not let my flock get attacked.
[1963.74 → 1964.92] I am the good shepherd.
[1965.02 → 1965.56] And you know what that means
[1965.56 → 1965.96] for Jesus?
[1966.64 → 1968.12] It means that when his own disciple,
[1968.38 → 1969.50] Judas, betrays him,
[1969.78 → 1970.50] he doesn't run.
[1971.36 → 1973.06] It means when he is arrested
[1973.06 → 1974.74] and he is mocked,
[1974.92 → 1976.02] he does not run.
[1976.50 → 1977.68] It means when Pilate
[1977.68 → 1979.04] is giving him an out,
[1979.60 → 1981.16] not wanting to crucify him,
[1981.20 → 1982.50] he does not run.
[1983.10 → 1983.80] And it means that
[1983.80 → 1985.14] when he's hanging on the cross,
[1985.70 → 1987.24] nailed in humiliation
[1987.24 → 1988.78] before everyone to see,
[1988.78 → 1991.94] he does not run.
[1992.74 → 1994.96] The full force of the powers
[1994.96 → 1995.84] and the principalities
[1995.84 → 1997.88] all the forces of human evil
[1997.88 → 1999.40] came against Jesus
[1999.40 → 2000.56] and the good shepherd
[2000.56 → 2001.54] stood there
[2001.54 → 2003.44] and he received it.
[2004.30 → 2005.08] And I think one of the most
[2005.08 → 2006.62] powerful parts of this passage
[2006.62 → 2008.72] is Jesus knows it's coming
[2008.72 → 2009.88] and he says in John 10,
[2010.32 → 2012.28] I'm going to lay down my life.
[2013.20 → 2014.14] This isn't just something
[2014.14 → 2014.94] that's happening to me.
[2015.06 → 2016.80] I was sent for this purpose.
[2016.94 → 2017.94] I'm going to lay it down
[2017.94 → 2018.72] voluntarily,
[2019.62 → 2020.22] wilfully,
[2020.34 → 2022.08] and substitutionally
[2022.08 → 2023.36] so that the flock
[2023.36 → 2024.78] gets life.
[2024.78 → 2026.42] so that the flock
[2026.42 → 2027.76] gets saved.
[2028.64 → 2029.62] And in verse 17 and 18,
[2029.74 → 2030.30] it's just striking,
[2030.38 → 2031.06] it's chilling to me
[2031.06 → 2032.24] how much power Jesus has here.
[2032.32 → 2032.42] He's like,
[2032.64 → 2033.26] I have the authority
[2033.26 → 2034.48] to lay my life down
[2034.48 → 2035.56] and I have the authority
[2035.56 → 2036.42] to take it up again.
[2037.58 → 2038.24] He's already pointing
[2038.24 → 2038.56] to the fact that
[2038.56 → 2039.42] he's going to die on a cross
[2039.42 → 2040.22] and he's going to break
[2040.22 → 2041.00] the power of death
[2041.00 → 2041.68] because Jesus
[2041.68 → 2043.60] is the Son of God.
[2044.18 → 2045.26] He is the good shepherd
[2045.26 → 2046.10] who will exhaust
[2046.10 → 2046.96] the forces of evil,
[2047.16 → 2048.40] who will exhaust the threats
[2048.40 → 2050.38] and bring life forever.
[2054.26 → 2055.66] And when Jesus repeats
[2055.66 → 2056.70] this statement
[2056.70 → 2057.56] that he is the good shepherd
[2057.56 → 2058.02] in 14,
[2058.50 → 2059.36] it's easy to miss.
[2059.44 → 2060.14] It almost feels like
[2060.14 → 2060.68] Jesus is just saying
[2060.68 → 2061.44] the same thing twice,
[2061.52 → 2062.62] but I really want to hone in
[2062.62 → 2064.00] on how he reshapes
[2064.00 → 2064.98] this same statement.
[2065.08 → 2065.78] In verse 14,
[2065.86 → 2066.18] he says,
[2066.26 → 2067.02] I'm the good shepherd.
[2067.68 → 2069.06] I know my sheep
[2069.06 → 2071.10] and my sheep know me.
[2071.54 → 2073.66] Just as the Father knows me
[2073.66 → 2074.66] and I know the Father
[2074.66 → 2076.20] and I lay down my life
[2076.20 → 2077.02] for the sheep.
[2077.50 → 2078.16] Now scholars point
[2078.16 → 2078.98] on something I never saw,
[2079.08 → 2080.22] that Jesus is repeating himself
[2080.22 → 2081.60] but he's shifting his imagery.
[2082.38 → 2083.32] He's no longer talking
[2083.32 → 2083.96] about the field,
[2084.08 → 2085.04] he's talking about a home.
[2085.52 → 2086.24] He's no longer talking
[2086.24 → 2086.72] about work,
[2086.82 → 2088.20] he's talking about family.
[2089.06 → 2089.72] And don't miss
[2089.72 → 2090.64] the hugest of this.
[2090.70 → 2091.00] He's saying,
[2091.30 → 2092.50] in the same way
[2092.50 → 2094.18] that I know the Father
[2094.18 → 2095.26] and in a relationship
[2095.26 → 2095.76] with the Father,
[2095.94 → 2097.00] I want you to be
[2097.00 → 2097.78] knowing me
[2097.78 → 2098.42] and in a relationship
[2098.42 → 2098.88] with me.
[2099.80 → 2100.58] That's huge.
[2101.34 → 2101.56] I mean,
[2101.86 → 2102.96] Christianity sometimes
[2102.96 → 2103.84] can get pegged
[2103.84 → 2105.12] as a religious
[2105.12 → 2106.98] kind of rules
[2106.98 → 2107.96] it's all about
[2107.96 → 2108.98] what the book says,
[2109.04 → 2109.48] it's all about
[2109.48 → 2110.56] sort of what you can't do here
[2110.56 → 2111.30] and what you can do there
[2111.30 → 2111.84] and Jesus is saying,
[2112.22 → 2112.76] I have come
[2112.76 → 2114.38] so that the same relationship
[2114.38 → 2115.56] I have with the Father,
[2115.90 → 2116.70] the same intimacy
[2116.70 → 2117.28] I have with the Father,
[2117.36 → 2117.90] the same knowledge
[2117.90 → 2118.44] I have with the Father,
[2118.66 → 2119.82] you have with me.
[2120.74 → 2121.96] You get to know me,
[2122.08 → 2122.74] your good shepherd,
[2122.84 → 2123.28] the same way
[2123.28 → 2123.80] I know the Father.
[2123.88 → 2124.90] I'm pulling you in
[2124.90 → 2125.78] to the family
[2125.78 → 2126.72] that is life.
[2127.48 → 2128.62] You can know my voice.
[2129.10 → 2130.20] You can hear me speak
[2130.20 → 2130.88] through my word.
[2131.06 → 2131.28] In fact,
[2131.58 → 2132.52] two people this week
[2132.52 → 2133.62] told me stories
[2133.62 → 2134.96] of Christ speaking to them
[2134.96 → 2135.30] and I'm like,
[2135.40 → 2135.62] man,
[2136.00 → 2136.32] right,
[2136.64 → 2137.50] Jesus still speaks.
[2137.60 → 2138.38] He's still the good shepherd
[2138.38 → 2138.82] of the flock.
[2138.94 → 2140.68] He can be known by us
[2140.68 → 2142.36] and I often think,
[2142.46 → 2142.56] man,
[2142.60 → 2143.16] do we realize
[2143.16 → 2144.62] how much he's offering us
[2144.62 → 2145.68] as Christians?
[2146.48 → 2147.58] Do we see what Jesus
[2147.58 → 2148.18] is on about
[2148.18 → 2148.78] in this passage
[2148.78 → 2149.54] where he doesn't just want
[2149.54 → 2150.98] sheep as a flock
[2150.98 → 2152.60] that he works to lead
[2152.60 → 2154.42] but sheep that know his voice,
[2155.64 → 2156.70] sheep that know his heart,
[2157.44 → 2158.04] sheep that belong
[2158.04 → 2159.10] to his family.
[2159.88 → 2161.30] That's what's on offer here
[2161.30 → 2162.74] and that's just one
[2162.74 → 2163.16] of the things
[2163.16 → 2163.86] that makes Jesus
[2163.86 → 2164.78] not just a shepherd
[2164.78 → 2166.52] but a good shepherd.
[2167.38 → 2168.00] The shepherd you want
[2168.00 → 2168.96] to just hand over
[2168.96 → 2169.86] the keys to your life
[2169.86 → 2170.30] and say,
[2170.98 → 2171.60] lead me.
[2172.32 → 2173.06] I trust you.
[2175.56 → 2176.56] Now I want to finish
[2176.56 → 2177.36] actually by looking
[2177.36 → 2178.24] at verse 16.
[2178.92 → 2179.56] I think this is
[2179.56 → 2180.46] a fascinating shift.
[2180.56 → 2181.38] So far Jesus has talked
[2181.38 → 2182.08] about his relationship
[2182.08 → 2182.64] with the flock.
[2182.74 → 2183.18] He's talked about
[2183.18 → 2183.98] how he is the gate.
[2184.08 → 2184.84] He's the good shepherd.
[2185.12 → 2185.68] That dynamic.
[2185.80 → 2186.62] And then in verse 16
[2186.62 → 2188.34] he shifts to say,
[2188.96 → 2190.46] I have other sheep
[2190.46 → 2191.76] that are not
[2191.76 → 2192.56] in this sheep pen.
[2192.56 → 2195.64] I must bring them also.
[2196.04 → 2196.92] They too will
[2196.92 → 2197.90] listen to my voice
[2197.90 → 2198.78] and there shall be
[2198.78 → 2199.62] one flock
[2199.62 → 2200.96] and one shepherd.
[2201.06 → 2201.66] Now what is Jesus
[2201.66 → 2202.46] talking about there?
[2203.96 → 2205.66] What is he getting at
[2205.66 → 2206.72] with this verse?
[2208.44 → 2209.24] He's talking about
[2209.24 → 2209.66] the nations.
[2211.06 → 2211.60] He's talking about
[2211.60 → 2212.54] the many, many
[2212.54 → 2213.58] millions of people
[2213.58 → 2215.16] including us
[2215.16 → 2216.30] who will hear
[2216.30 → 2217.16] the good news of Jesus
[2217.16 → 2217.72] like Peter
[2217.72 → 2219.36] and respond in faith.
[2219.36 → 2220.90] And I think
[2220.90 → 2221.64] it's really striking
[2221.64 → 2222.42] if you look at
[2222.42 → 2223.30] some of the greatest
[2223.30 → 2224.18] criticism of Jesus
[2224.18 → 2224.82] and some of the greatest
[2224.82 → 2225.64] confusion about Jesus
[2225.64 → 2226.72] is that Jews put him
[2226.72 → 2227.86] in such a small box.
[2228.40 → 2229.08] They wanted a Messiah
[2229.08 → 2229.54] who would do
[2229.54 → 2230.12] what previous
[2230.12 → 2231.36] false Messiahs did.
[2231.74 → 2232.20] That is like
[2232.20 → 2232.88] try to go to war
[2232.88 → 2233.48] against Rome,
[2233.62 → 2234.56] reestablish Jerusalem,
[2234.90 → 2235.62] get the Jewish people
[2235.62 → 2236.52] safely in their city
[2236.52 → 2237.88] to enjoy God's presence.
[2238.00 → 2238.60] And Jesus is like
[2238.60 → 2240.16] that is such a small view
[2240.16 → 2241.44] of who I am.
[2241.98 → 2242.72] I am not just
[2242.72 → 2243.10] the shepherd
[2243.10 → 2244.18] of one little flock
[2244.18 → 2245.08] in one little city,
[2245.36 → 2246.24] one ethnicity.
[2246.42 → 2246.60] He's like,
[2246.60 → 2247.94] I want a whole
[2247.94 → 2249.52] worldwide family.
[2249.62 → 2251.34] My flock spans the globe.
[2252.24 → 2253.10] And I want to hear for you,
[2253.18 → 2253.72] I want you to hear
[2253.72 → 2254.60] what Dale Brunei says
[2254.60 → 2255.00] about this
[2255.00 → 2255.32] because I think
[2255.32 → 2255.84] it's amazing.
[2256.60 → 2257.32] But first let me say,
[2257.64 → 2258.36] I think it's striking
[2258.36 → 2258.70] that he says,
[2259.00 → 2261.74] I must bring them also.
[2262.10 → 2262.88] Like there's an urgency
[2262.88 → 2263.94] that Jesus speaks with.
[2264.04 → 2265.10] And Dale Brunei comments,
[2265.50 → 2266.40] Jesus' passion
[2266.40 → 2268.42] is for his one church
[2268.42 → 2269.20] in the whole world.
[2269.86 → 2270.72] He wants to be a shepherd
[2270.72 → 2272.64] of a worldwide community.
[2273.50 → 2274.56] Jesus loves the world.
[2275.06 → 2276.06] He has people in it
[2276.06 → 2277.52] who he must reach
[2277.52 → 2279.50] and who he intends to lead.
[2282.18 → 2283.16] He's a good shepherd.
[2285.02 → 2286.32] And it shouldn't surprise us
[2286.32 → 2287.40] that as Jesus rises
[2287.40 → 2288.08] from the grave,
[2288.58 → 2290.26] he shows his resurrection power,
[2290.34 → 2291.30] he ascends to be with the Father.
[2291.36 → 2292.00] What does he do next?
[2292.66 → 2293.70] He pours out his spirit
[2293.70 → 2294.30] on the church.
[2295.06 → 2296.24] And as Luke starts his gospel,
[2296.34 → 2296.48] he says,
[2296.58 → 2298.10] this is what Jesus continues
[2298.10 → 2300.74] to do through the church.
[2301.32 → 2302.08] Jesus continues
[2302.08 → 2303.04] to make himself known.
[2303.14 → 2304.32] He continues to demonstrate
[2304.32 → 2305.52] acts of power and miracles.
[2305.52 → 2306.92] He continues to gather
[2306.92 → 2308.30] in the nations
[2308.30 → 2309.70] through the church.
[2310.80 → 2312.12] And it shouldn't surprise us
[2312.12 → 2313.90] that that is his great delight
[2313.90 → 2315.08] to be the shepherd
[2315.08 → 2316.32] of a worldwide family.
[2317.92 → 2318.30] You know,
[2318.32 → 2318.92] the verse that pops
[2318.92 → 2319.64] in my head this week
[2319.64 → 2320.78] as I was looking at this passage
[2320.78 → 2321.34] in particular
[2321.34 → 2322.56] is Jesus in Mark,
[2322.66 → 2323.32] or Matthew 9,
[2323.38 → 2323.78] where he says,
[2323.86 → 2324.94] the harvest is plentiful.
[2326.02 → 2326.62] Do you believe that,
[2326.68 → 2326.94] first?
[2326.94 → 2327.98] The harvest is plentiful,
[2327.98 → 2330.00] but the labourers are few.
[2330.56 → 2331.44] And what does he say next?
[2332.88 → 2334.48] Pray that the Lord
[2334.48 → 2335.18] of the harvest
[2335.18 → 2336.48] will send workers
[2336.48 → 2337.56] into the field.
[2338.16 → 2338.92] And he's not just talking
[2338.92 → 2340.34] about professional missionaries
[2340.34 → 2342.24] or hired passers
[2342.24 → 2343.24] or people who have degrees
[2343.24 → 2343.96] to do certain things.
[2344.02 → 2344.48] He's talking about
[2344.48 → 2345.30] the church
[2345.30 → 2347.14] sent into the world
[2347.14 → 2348.36] to live,
[2348.70 → 2349.00] speak,
[2349.08 → 2349.80] and make known
[2349.80 → 2350.70] in their communal life
[2350.70 → 2352.18] the resurrected Jesus
[2352.18 → 2353.18] as the good shepherd.
[2353.18 → 2355.50] The church is sent
[2355.50 → 2356.12] to sort of say
[2356.12 → 2356.66] to the world
[2356.66 → 2358.12] in all of our ordinary ways,
[2358.84 → 2359.46] I'm not called
[2359.46 → 2360.26] to leave my life.
[2361.30 → 2362.20] I'm not the shepherd.
[2362.78 → 2363.82] I'm a wayward sheep,
[2363.90 → 2364.46] but let me point you
[2364.46 → 2365.28] to the one who leads.
[2365.86 → 2366.48] And when you follow
[2366.48 → 2367.14] his lead,
[2367.22 → 2368.16] you follow his voice,
[2368.26 → 2369.08] you follow his instruction,
[2369.20 → 2370.18] you find salvation.
[2371.04 → 2372.64] You find abundant life.
[2375.18 → 2375.96] To summarize
[2375.96 → 2377.56] and conclude,
[2378.68 → 2379.84] Jesus himself
[2379.84 → 2380.62] is saying to us,
[2380.70 → 2380.96] church,
[2381.56 → 2382.84] he's inviting all of us
[2382.84 → 2383.16] to believe
[2383.16 → 2383.72] that he is
[2383.72 → 2385.16] the good shepherd.
[2386.24 → 2386.94] And that means
[2386.94 → 2387.64] he's inviting us
[2387.64 → 2388.10] to believe
[2388.10 → 2388.98] that his voice
[2388.98 → 2389.68] is life.
[2390.40 → 2390.94] That obedience
[2390.94 → 2391.98] to his instruction
[2391.98 → 2393.68] is the flourishing
[2393.68 → 2394.52] of human life.
[2394.58 → 2395.16] It's salvation.
[2395.96 → 2396.58] He's inviting
[2396.58 → 2397.42] to trust
[2397.42 → 2398.54] his provision,
[2399.32 → 2399.84] even now,
[2399.92 → 2400.48] even in your life,
[2400.54 → 2401.14] whatever you're going through.
[2401.24 → 2402.62] Trust his protection,
[2403.36 → 2404.04] that he knows
[2404.04 → 2404.56] what we need,
[2404.64 → 2405.54] that he knows
[2405.54 → 2407.12] how to hold us
[2407.12 → 2408.14] in seasons of pain
[2408.14 → 2408.68] and difficulty
[2408.68 → 2409.22] and grief.
[2410.38 → 2410.86] And
[2410.86 → 2412.92] he invites us
[2412.92 → 2413.82] to share
[2413.82 → 2415.44] the news
[2415.44 → 2416.64] that he is
[2416.64 → 2417.24] the good shepherd
[2417.24 → 2418.10] so that the world
[2418.10 → 2418.94] knows that there is
[2418.94 → 2419.56] one gate,
[2420.12 → 2420.92] there's one door,
[2421.02 → 2421.70] there's one way
[2421.70 → 2422.22] of life
[2422.22 → 2423.26] and salvation,
[2423.58 → 2424.04] and that is
[2424.04 → 2424.86] Jesus Christ,
[2425.32 → 2426.26] the resurrected
[2426.26 → 2427.48] good shepherd.
[2428.64 → 2429.38] Let's pray.
[2429.38 → 2433.08] Father,
[2433.14 → 2433.54] we thank you
[2433.54 → 2434.12] for your word.
[2435.48 → 2435.98] And Father,
[2436.04 → 2436.50] we thank you
[2436.50 → 2437.48] that in our own ways
[2437.48 → 2438.36] we've discovered
[2438.36 → 2439.50] that Jesus
[2439.50 → 2440.32] is the good shepherd.
[2441.68 → 2442.88] I pray that even today
[2442.88 → 2443.40] in our worship
[2443.40 → 2444.28] you would reveal to us
[2444.28 → 2444.92] the way that you
[2444.92 → 2446.08] have provided for us,
[2446.76 → 2447.42] the way that you're
[2447.42 → 2448.18] faithful to us,
[2448.24 → 2449.32] the way you lead us
[2449.32 → 2450.30] and protect us.
[2451.00 → 2451.72] And we ask,
[2451.88 → 2451.96] Lord,
[2452.02 → 2452.94] that you would draw
[2452.94 → 2454.28] many people
[2454.28 → 2456.08] into your flock,
[2456.44 → 2458.36] that you would use us
[2458.36 → 2459.28] as a church
[2459.28 → 2459.98] in this city
[2459.98 → 2461.36] to make known
[2461.36 → 2461.88] the truth
[2461.88 → 2462.38] that Jesus
[2462.38 → 2463.46] is the good shepherd,
[2464.02 → 2464.80] that he is the way,
[2464.90 → 2465.76] that he is the gate,
[2466.48 → 2467.18] the means
[2467.18 → 2468.08] to the full,
[2468.22 → 2468.66] abundant,
[2468.98 → 2469.84] saved life.
[2471.10 → 2472.28] Fill us with your spirit
[2472.28 → 2473.50] to make known
[2473.50 → 2474.26] that good news.
[2474.78 → 2475.00] Amen.
[2476.58 → 2477.74] I invite you to stand
