[0.00 --> 2.62]  I thought I would just say a word about giving for a moment,
[2.74 --> 4.46]  because this came from another dad in our church,
[4.52 --> 5.86]  and I thought it was an insightful comment.
[6.44 --> 7.70]  You know, since the pandemic began,
[7.78 --> 9.24]  we sort of moved all our giving online,
[9.50 --> 10.98]  and there is something about passing.
[11.40 --> 13.34]  We used to pass an offering plate around,
[14.18 --> 15.66]  and the dad just said, you know,
[15.70 --> 16.84]  and that doesn't happen in the service.
[16.92 --> 18.64]  The kids don't actually see us giving,
[19.40 --> 20.42]  and I just want to encourage you,
[20.50 --> 21.62]  however you do your giving,
[21.70 --> 22.64]  whether it's online regularly,
[22.88 --> 24.12]  pull your kids into it
[24.12 --> 26.78]  and help them see that giving is a practice of Christians.
[26.84 --> 29.42]  I have very fond memories of seeing my dad
[29.42 --> 30.94]  on Sunday mornings, the first of every month,
[31.00 --> 31.72]  so it would be next week.
[31.98 --> 33.02]  He'd always have envelopes,
[33.04 --> 34.22]  and he'd put money in the envelopes,
[34.24 --> 35.16]  and we knew, like, okay,
[35.22 --> 37.30]  my parents prioritize giving to the church.
[38.50 --> 39.34]  And I'll give you an illustration.
[39.52 --> 41.00]  This comes from Daryl Johnson at Regent College,
[41.06 --> 41.84]  where he did this years ago,
[41.88 --> 42.56]  and it stuck with me.
[42.60 --> 43.56]  He says, you know, I have $10.
[43.80 --> 44.66]  I never have cash on me,
[44.68 --> 46.14]  so I have the opportunity for this one.
[46.18 --> 47.66]  But he says, whenever you give to the church,
[48.26 --> 49.42]  you're saying, first of all,
[49.88 --> 51.82]  thank you, God, for your generosity to me.
[52.56 --> 54.14]  You've taken care of me this week.
[54.32 --> 56.50]  He says, secondly, you're saying,
[56.78 --> 59.40]  I want to get in on the ministry God is doing,
[59.42 --> 60.38]  through my church.
[60.82 --> 61.92]  And man, I can say firsthand,
[62.00 --> 63.36]  there's amazing ministry that happens
[63.36 --> 64.56]  every week through this church.
[65.10 --> 67.08]  But thirdly, and maybe most importantly,
[67.22 --> 68.14]  in a Western society,
[68.30 --> 69.84]  you are saying when you give,
[70.52 --> 73.46]  money, you don't control me.
[74.40 --> 76.06]  You don't determine everything.
[76.22 --> 79.06]  I can give it away because it's not my idol.
[79.98 --> 81.82]  So just a brief teaching on money there.
[81.90 --> 83.48]  I know some of us need to hear that more than others,
[83.62 --> 85.96]  but I want to make it a practice
[85.96 --> 87.14]  for us as a church
[87.14 --> 88.48]  as we start this new year
[88.48 --> 90.64]  as generosity and bringing our kids
[90.64 --> 92.70]  into this practice of giving as believers.
[94.18 --> 95.56]  All right, we're going to continue our series
[95.56 --> 96.48]  on the Gospel of John.
[96.74 --> 99.56]  And I hope that as you are reading along with us,
[99.60 --> 100.66]  you know that we're on John 4,
[100.92 --> 102.20]  a fairly well-known story of Jesus
[102.20 --> 104.08]  meeting a Samaritan woman at the well.
[104.38 --> 105.20]  So if you have your Bible,
[105.36 --> 106.80]  turn with me to John chapter 4
[106.80 --> 107.66]  and do keep it open.
[108.54 --> 109.22]  And you should know,
[109.30 --> 110.48]  as we are about to read this,
[110.54 --> 112.66]  that this passage is considered by many
[112.66 --> 114.36]  to be sort of a famous passage
[114.36 --> 116.10]  where Jesus teaches the church
[116.10 --> 117.90]  how to share the gospel,
[118.06 --> 119.30]  how to evangelize.
[119.38 --> 120.46]  So let's read it together.
[123.34 --> 126.02]  Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees
[126.02 --> 127.46]  had heard that he was gaining
[127.46 --> 129.62]  and baptizing more disciples than John,
[130.12 --> 131.24]  although in fact it was not Jesus
[131.24 --> 132.56]  who baptized but his disciples.
[133.28 --> 134.16]  So he left Judea
[134.16 --> 135.74]  and went back once more to Galilee.
[136.64 --> 138.54]  Now we had to go through Samaria.
[139.16 --> 140.58]  So we came to a town in Samaria
[140.58 --> 141.32]  called Sychar,
[141.52 --> 142.44]  near the plot of ground
[142.44 --> 143.96]  Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
[144.90 --> 145.90]  Jacob's well was there
[145.90 --> 147.82]  and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey,
[148.00 --> 149.08]  sat down by the well.
[149.64 --> 150.38]  It was about noon.
[151.40 --> 153.30]  When a Samaritan woman came to draw water,
[153.56 --> 154.50]  Jesus said to her,
[154.72 --> 155.84]  will you give me a drink?
[156.56 --> 158.02]  His disciples had gone into the town
[158.02 --> 158.66]  to buy food.
[159.44 --> 160.70]  The Samaritan woman said to him,
[161.10 --> 162.10]  you are a Jew
[162.10 --> 163.70]  and I'm a Samaritan woman.
[164.30 --> 166.42]  How can you ask me for a drink?
[166.80 --> 169.30]  For Jews did not associate with Samaritans.
[170.16 --> 171.08]  Jesus answered her,
[171.54 --> 172.98]  if you knew the gift of God
[172.98 --> 175.84]  and who it was that asked you for a drink,
[176.38 --> 177.42]  you would have asked him
[177.42 --> 180.16]  and he would have given you living water.
[181.34 --> 182.54]  Sir, the woman said,
[183.08 --> 184.30]  you have nothing to draw with
[184.30 --> 185.08]  and the well is deep.
[185.34 --> 186.72]  Where can you get this living water?
[187.16 --> 189.04]  Are you greater than our father Jacob
[189.04 --> 190.00]  who gave us the well
[190.00 --> 191.14]  and drank from it himself
[191.14 --> 192.00]  as did his sons
[192.00 --> 193.48]  and also his flocks and herds?
[194.48 --> 195.22]  Jesus answered,
[195.40 --> 196.62]  everyone who drinks the water
[196.62 --> 197.32]  will be thirsty.
[197.32 --> 199.10]  But those who drink the water
[199.10 --> 199.96]  I give them
[199.96 --> 201.16]  will never thirst.
[201.84 --> 203.04]  Indeed, the water I give them
[203.04 --> 204.18]  will become in them
[204.18 --> 205.34]  a spring of water
[205.34 --> 207.52]  welling up to eternal life.
[208.58 --> 209.76]  The woman said to him,
[210.14 --> 211.44]  sir, give me this water
[211.44 --> 212.64]  so that I won't go thirsty
[212.64 --> 213.52]  and have to keep coming
[213.52 --> 214.38]  to draw water.
[215.66 --> 216.46]  He told her,
[217.28 --> 218.64]  go call your husband
[218.64 --> 219.82]  and come back.
[221.52 --> 222.76]  I have no husband,
[222.92 --> 223.48]  she replied.
[224.84 --> 225.68]  Jesus said to her,
[225.68 --> 226.80]  sir, you are right
[226.80 --> 228.14]  when you say you have no husband.
[228.76 --> 229.34]  Fact is,
[229.46 --> 230.42]  you've had five husbands
[230.42 --> 233.42]  and the man that you now have
[233.42 --> 234.40]  is not your husband.
[235.46 --> 236.66]  What you have said is just,
[236.96 --> 237.00]  sir,
[237.08 --> 237.78]  what you have just said
[237.78 --> 238.46]  is quite true.
[239.80 --> 240.58]  Sir, the woman said,
[240.62 --> 241.98]  I can see that you're a prophet.
[242.94 --> 244.06]  Our ancestors worshipped
[244.06 --> 244.68]  on this mountain
[244.68 --> 246.00]  but you Jews claim
[246.00 --> 246.60]  that this place
[246.60 --> 247.36]  where we must worship
[247.36 --> 248.14]  is in Jerusalem.
[249.40 --> 250.70]  Woman, Jesus replied,
[250.86 --> 251.44]  believe me,
[251.82 --> 252.64]  a time is coming
[252.64 --> 253.42]  when you will worship
[253.42 --> 253.90]  the Father
[253.90 --> 255.14]  neither on this mountain
[255.14 --> 256.24]  nor in Jerusalem.
[257.10 --> 258.12]  You Samaritans worship
[258.12 --> 259.12]  what you do not know.
[259.78 --> 261.00]  We worship what we do know
[261.00 --> 262.84]  for salvation is from the Jews.
[263.52 --> 264.44]  Yet a time is coming
[264.44 --> 265.32]  and has now come
[265.32 --> 266.42]  when true worshippers
[266.42 --> 267.50]  will worship the Father
[267.50 --> 268.18]  in the spirit
[268.18 --> 269.32]  and in truth
[269.32 --> 270.50]  for they are the kind
[270.50 --> 271.02]  of worshippers
[271.02 --> 272.24]  the Father seeks.
[272.98 --> 273.76]  God is spirit
[273.76 --> 274.94]  and his worshippers
[274.94 --> 275.74]  must worship
[275.74 --> 276.50]  in spirit
[276.50 --> 277.78]  and in truth.
[279.04 --> 280.04]  The woman said,
[280.04 --> 281.10]  I know the Messiah
[281.10 --> 282.44]  called Christ is coming.
[282.86 --> 283.42]  When he comes
[283.42 --> 284.02]  he will explain
[284.02 --> 284.88]  everything to us.
[285.74 --> 287.04]  Then Jesus declared,
[287.84 --> 290.10]  I the one speaking to you
[290.10 --> 292.38]  I am he.
[297.46 --> 298.84]  So I recently heard
[298.84 --> 300.34]  the story from a friend
[300.34 --> 301.64]  of a game they were playing
[301.64 --> 303.80]  sitting on a Friday night
[303.80 --> 304.68]  in their living room
[304.68 --> 305.74]  and they're playing a game.
[305.86 --> 306.24]  It's one of those,
[306.32 --> 306.72]  there's a bunch
[306.72 --> 307.24]  of these games.
[307.38 --> 307.80]  It's where you have
[307.80 --> 308.52]  a deck of cards
[308.52 --> 309.58]  like an icebreaker game
[309.58 --> 310.60]  where you draw these cards
[310.60 --> 310.96]  and it just has
[310.96 --> 312.10]  these random questions
[312.10 --> 313.28]  that are intended
[313.28 --> 314.32]  to make you answer
[314.32 --> 315.00]  hard questions
[315.00 --> 316.58]  like most embarrassing moment,
[317.10 --> 318.22]  worst food you've ever eaten,
[318.40 --> 319.76]  regrets you have, etc.
[320.02 --> 320.76]  You know what I'm talking about?
[320.80 --> 321.50]  You play these games,
[321.76 --> 322.86]  there's like tons of them
[322.86 --> 324.04]  around right now.
[324.58 --> 325.26]  And there's different rules
[325.26 --> 325.82]  around these games.
[325.92 --> 326.60]  You can sort of make
[326.60 --> 327.16]  other people answer
[327.16 --> 327.94]  the question for you,
[327.98 --> 328.56]  you can pass
[328.56 --> 329.46]  if you don't like the question.
[330.14 --> 330.72]  And this friend
[330.72 --> 331.22]  who was playing
[331.22 --> 331.98]  in the living room
[331.98 --> 333.44]  with friends on Friday night,
[333.68 --> 334.46]  they're going around
[334.46 --> 335.74]  and someone picked up this card
[335.74 --> 336.70]  and they looked at the card
[336.70 --> 338.06]  and they passed it
[338.06 --> 338.84]  to the person to the right.
[339.58 --> 340.66]  And that person picked it up
[340.66 --> 341.28]  and looked at it
[341.28 --> 342.64]  and the question was,
[343.18 --> 344.50]  talk about your relationship
[344.50 --> 345.58]  with your mother-in-law.
[347.80 --> 349.06]  And they looked at that card
[349.06 --> 349.60]  and they said,
[349.92 --> 351.26]  I'm not emotionally prepared
[351.26 --> 352.36]  to talk about this question.
[354.26 --> 355.28]  What is that anyway?
[355.36 --> 356.06]  Hey, mother-in-laws.
[357.12 --> 357.92]  But there's something
[357.92 --> 358.74]  about that question
[358.74 --> 360.42]  that hit a nerve
[360.42 --> 361.14]  with this person.
[362.00 --> 362.92]  And there is something
[362.92 --> 363.96]  about that story,
[364.18 --> 365.10]  maybe that relationship
[365.10 --> 365.50]  that's like,
[365.56 --> 365.96]  you know what,
[365.98 --> 366.98]  I don't want to go there.
[366.98 --> 367.94]  And so we're just going
[367.94 --> 368.78]  to leave that question alone.
[370.62 --> 371.90]  We all have those questions,
[372.04 --> 372.44]  by the way.
[373.66 --> 374.96]  You and I all have those cards
[374.96 --> 375.30]  where we're like,
[375.38 --> 376.50]  I'm not ready to answer that one.
[376.54 --> 377.60]  In fact, I know people,
[377.74 --> 378.50]  even in our community,
[378.58 --> 379.76]  who will not play these games
[379.76 --> 380.62]  because we don't want
[380.62 --> 381.52]  to get those cards,
[381.96 --> 383.48]  whatever that card may be.
[384.00 --> 384.76]  You want to leave
[384.76 --> 386.58]  well enough alone.
[387.90 --> 388.90]  Now in John 4,
[389.82 --> 390.60]  when Jesus talks
[390.60 --> 391.58]  to the Samaritan woman,
[392.16 --> 394.42]  he asks that question.
[394.42 --> 397.04]  And he asks it not to shame her,
[397.26 --> 398.24]  not to make her feel guilty,
[398.50 --> 399.96]  but to draw her life
[399.96 --> 400.84]  into the light
[400.84 --> 401.98]  and for her to see
[401.98 --> 402.76]  that place,
[402.86 --> 404.50]  that hard story
[404.50 --> 405.56]  in the light
[405.56 --> 406.06]  of the grace
[406.06 --> 406.82]  of Jesus Christ.
[408.46 --> 409.58]  Now John 4
[409.58 --> 410.76]  is really about
[410.76 --> 411.64]  Jesus' humanity.
[412.68 --> 413.70]  It's about this perfect
[413.70 --> 414.62]  embodiment,
[414.76 --> 415.18]  in my opinion,
[415.24 --> 416.10]  of Jesus' grace
[416.10 --> 417.38]  and speaking truth.
[418.00 --> 419.04]  And it's a story
[419.04 --> 421.28]  of boundary-breaking compassion.
[421.44 --> 422.06]  And I hope we see
[422.06 --> 422.92]  all of those layers
[422.92 --> 423.54]  this morning
[423.54 --> 424.86]  as we walk our way
[424.86 --> 425.62]  through this story.
[426.88 --> 427.72]  Now this passage
[427.72 --> 428.80]  begins with places
[428.80 --> 429.46]  being named.
[429.68 --> 430.36]  It's Samaria,
[430.68 --> 431.18]  it's Sychar,
[431.46 --> 432.20]  and it's a well.
[432.64 --> 433.06]  And for us,
[433.12 --> 433.38]  that's like,
[433.42 --> 434.08]  hey, that's interesting,
[434.20 --> 435.02]  these little place names
[435.02 --> 435.98]  in this area.
[436.36 --> 437.96]  But readers of the first century
[437.96 --> 438.90]  who hear this story
[438.90 --> 439.82]  would be like,
[440.32 --> 440.62]  ooh,
[440.88 --> 442.22]  this takes place where?
[443.00 --> 443.80]  Oh wow.
[444.70 --> 445.62]  Because Samaria
[445.62 --> 446.60]  and Jerusalem,
[446.78 --> 447.18]  or I should say
[447.18 --> 448.36]  the Jews and the Samaritans,
[448.44 --> 449.00]  they had tension.
[449.10 --> 449.26]  In fact,
[449.32 --> 450.62]  they had four centuries
[450.62 --> 451.36]  of tension.
[451.88 --> 452.26]  You want to talk
[452.26 --> 453.08]  about division nowadays?
[453.08 --> 453.88]  These people went back
[453.88 --> 454.80]  four centuries
[454.80 --> 455.50]  where they didn't get along.
[455.88 --> 457.18]  Jews didn't like Samaritans
[457.18 --> 457.86]  so much
[457.86 --> 458.98]  that when they traveled
[458.98 --> 460.26]  and they had to go far places,
[460.46 --> 462.06]  they went around Samaria.
[462.52 --> 463.80]  They took the long route.
[464.38 --> 465.42]  That's like people in Surrey
[465.42 --> 466.74]  disliking Langley people
[466.74 --> 467.30]  so much.
[467.54 --> 468.46]  They go through mission
[468.46 --> 469.62]  to get to Abbotsford.
[471.10 --> 471.78]  And we're told
[471.78 --> 473.34]  that Jesus goes
[473.34 --> 474.62]  through Samaria
[474.62 --> 476.18]  because he had to.
[476.98 --> 477.54]  And I believe
[477.54 --> 478.26]  that that's the Spirit
[478.26 --> 479.06]  compelling Jesus
[479.06 --> 480.34]  to take the news
[480.34 --> 481.16]  of who he is
[481.16 --> 482.26]  to this place
[482.26 --> 483.06]  that people didn't think
[483.06 --> 483.60]  it belonged.
[483.88 --> 484.14]  In fact,
[484.20 --> 485.02]  you see in Acts 1
[485.02 --> 485.70]  when Jesus says
[485.70 --> 486.18]  to his disciples,
[486.52 --> 487.24]  you're going to be my witnesses.
[487.38 --> 487.64]  He says,
[487.68 --> 488.36]  you're going to be my witnesses
[488.36 --> 488.96]  in Jerusalem,
[489.38 --> 490.00]  you're going to be my witnesses
[490.00 --> 490.70]  in Judea,
[490.76 --> 491.22]  and you're going to be
[491.22 --> 493.00]  my witnesses in Samaria.
[493.38 --> 493.84]  And they're like,
[493.94 --> 494.20]  ooh,
[494.52 --> 495.38]  and to the ends of the earth,
[495.60 --> 496.10]  British Columbia.
[497.50 --> 498.20]  So Jesus is going
[498.20 --> 498.82]  to the very place
[498.82 --> 499.26]  that he sends
[499.26 --> 500.18]  his disciples later
[500.18 --> 501.04]  and he's going to bring
[501.04 --> 502.24]  good news about his identity
[502.24 --> 503.48]  in that place.
[504.28 --> 505.04]  But there's also
[505.04 --> 505.78]  a well named.
[506.02 --> 506.92]  And I learned this week
[506.92 --> 507.68]  I had no idea
[507.68 --> 508.64]  that in the Old Testament,
[509.36 --> 510.50]  wells are significant places.
[511.30 --> 512.50]  That's where Isaac
[512.50 --> 513.44]  met his future wife.
[513.52 --> 514.06]  That's where Jacob
[514.06 --> 514.82]  met his future wife.
[514.90 --> 515.68]  That's where Moses
[515.68 --> 516.78]  met his future wife.
[517.60 --> 518.10]  So I feel like
[518.10 --> 518.96]  the implication here
[518.96 --> 519.52]  is if you're single
[519.52 --> 519.94]  and you're looking
[519.94 --> 520.50]  for a wife,
[520.62 --> 521.54]  you've got to find yourself
[521.54 --> 522.38]  a well somewhere
[522.38 --> 523.26]  here in Surrey.
[524.00 --> 524.64]  There's good things,
[524.76 --> 525.64]  good Old Testament precedent
[525.64 --> 526.72]  for finding a good wife
[526.72 --> 527.30]  at a well.
[528.42 --> 529.50]  That is not the message
[529.50 --> 530.18]  of this passage.
[531.48 --> 532.72]  But it's here at this well
[532.72 --> 533.54]  that Jesus meets
[533.54 --> 534.34]  the Samaritan woman
[534.34 --> 535.16]  and he asks her
[535.16 --> 536.36]  a very human question.
[536.68 --> 537.36]  He's thirsty,
[537.62 --> 538.84]  he's been on a long trip
[538.84 --> 540.00]  right through the Samaria
[540.00 --> 540.66]  and he says to her,
[540.74 --> 542.02]  can you give me a drink?
[542.46 --> 543.78]  And in that very question,
[544.16 --> 546.08]  he breaks three social boundaries.
[546.44 --> 546.96]  Number one,
[547.14 --> 547.88]  she's a Samaritan.
[548.14 --> 548.58]  Number two,
[548.64 --> 549.04]  she's a woman.
[549.14 --> 549.54]  Number three,
[549.62 --> 550.88]  she has a questionable past.
[551.18 --> 551.88]  And we'll look at that
[551.88 --> 552.48]  in just a minute.
[553.00 --> 553.80]  And so this question
[553.80 --> 554.34]  he's asking
[554.34 --> 555.14]  is a hard question.
[555.32 --> 556.32]  And she knows this.
[556.38 --> 556.66]  She says,
[556.66 --> 557.50]  whoa, whoa, whoa,
[557.80 --> 558.46]  you, a Jew,
[558.56 --> 559.08]  talking to me,
[559.14 --> 559.66]  a Samaritan?
[559.88 --> 560.88]  This conversation
[560.88 --> 561.78]  can't be happening.
[562.98 --> 564.46]  But Jesus doesn't care.
[564.46 --> 566.74]  And I think it's important
[566.74 --> 567.76]  for us to see already
[567.76 --> 568.74]  between chapter three
[568.74 --> 569.54]  and chapter four.
[569.92 --> 570.44]  Chapter three,
[570.58 --> 571.58]  Jesus is identifying,
[571.74 --> 572.66]  he's sharing who he is
[572.66 --> 573.30]  to Nicodemus,
[573.36 --> 574.26]  a Jewish elite,
[574.34 --> 575.32]  person of high profile.
[575.56 --> 576.36]  And here he is
[576.36 --> 577.42]  with this Samaritan woman
[577.42 --> 578.78]  who in the eyes of Jews
[578.78 --> 580.64]  was a low social status,
[580.84 --> 581.98]  not worth talking to.
[582.04 --> 582.50]  And Jesus is like,
[582.56 --> 582.98]  I'm going to share
[582.98 --> 584.24]  the gospel of who I am
[584.24 --> 585.32]  with Nicodemus
[585.32 --> 586.30]  and I'm going to share
[586.30 --> 587.36]  it with this Samaritan woman.
[587.80 --> 589.28]  She in the kingdom of God
[589.28 --> 590.80]  is of the same standing
[590.80 --> 592.08]  as Nicodemus.
[593.10 --> 593.68]  And by the way,
[593.76 --> 594.72]  believers who live
[594.72 --> 595.40]  in the kingdom of God
[595.40 --> 597.22]  have that view of the city.
[597.38 --> 597.94]  And Carolyn prayed
[597.94 --> 598.68]  about that earlier.
[600.08 --> 601.50]  And Jesus in verse 10,
[601.74 --> 602.42]  if you have your Bible
[602.42 --> 602.92]  in front of me,
[603.00 --> 603.76]  says some of the most
[603.76 --> 605.00]  beautiful words
[605.00 --> 606.16]  to this woman.
[606.52 --> 607.48]  I'll read them for you.
[608.08 --> 608.70]  He says to her,
[608.70 --> 610.58]  if you knew the gift of God
[610.58 --> 612.04]  and who it was
[612.04 --> 613.74]  that asks you for a drink,
[614.18 --> 615.30]  you would have asked him
[615.30 --> 617.30]  and he would have given you
[617.30 --> 618.68]  living water.
[619.86 --> 620.28]  Are you catching
[620.28 --> 620.98]  what he's saying there?
[621.02 --> 621.78]  This is actually connected
[621.78 --> 622.38]  to Nicodemus.
[622.48 --> 623.40]  This free gift
[623.40 --> 624.24]  is the spirit.
[624.58 --> 625.70]  The spirit that opens eyes,
[625.82 --> 626.52]  that enables us
[626.52 --> 627.52]  to see who Jesus is,
[627.66 --> 628.86]  that rebirths us
[628.86 --> 629.92]  into the kingdom of God.
[630.16 --> 631.40]  If you knew the free gift
[631.40 --> 632.22]  and he says,
[632.32 --> 633.70]  if you knew who I am,
[635.00 --> 636.28]  you would ask me for water
[636.62 --> 638.46]  and I would give you
[638.46 --> 639.66]  living water.
[640.50 --> 641.44]  Don't miss that.
[641.78 --> 642.80]  Jesus, the Son of God,
[642.90 --> 643.78]  the Word made flesh,
[643.98 --> 644.96]  standing with this woman
[644.96 --> 645.48]  at the well,
[645.76 --> 646.20]  saying to her,
[646.38 --> 647.64]  if you ask me for a drink,
[648.22 --> 649.04]  I'm going to give you
[649.04 --> 649.56]  living water.
[649.68 --> 650.28]  I'm ready.
[650.82 --> 651.68]  You can have it.
[652.04 --> 652.74]  Samaritan woman
[652.74 --> 653.40]  who may think
[653.40 --> 654.18]  you don't belong
[654.18 --> 654.66]  or may think
[654.66 --> 655.42]  you're too far gone,
[655.64 --> 656.10]  I'm ready.
[656.72 --> 658.16]  Living water is yours.
[658.74 --> 659.52]  Just ask.
[660.14 --> 661.02]  You got to see me.
[662.88 --> 663.44]  And of course,
[663.64 --> 665.34]  like Nicodemus,
[665.46 --> 666.82]  this woman has no idea
[666.82 --> 668.14]  where he's going.
[668.26 --> 669.28]  It's like Jesus does this
[669.28 --> 669.92]  two times in a row.
[670.00 --> 671.20]  He gets all spiritual on them
[671.20 --> 672.56]  and they stay very pragmatic,
[672.78 --> 673.30]  very physical.
[673.42 --> 673.80]  She's like,
[673.80 --> 675.64]  you don't have a bucket.
[676.60 --> 677.42]  This well is deep.
[677.98 --> 679.16]  And are you greater than Jacob?
[679.78 --> 680.46]  And you just see
[680.46 --> 681.46]  they're going in totally
[681.46 --> 682.20]  different directions.
[682.52 --> 683.72]  And Jesus then restates
[683.72 --> 684.18]  his point.
[684.28 --> 684.78]  He says,
[685.14 --> 686.16]  whoever drinks of this
[686.16 --> 687.32]  water from the well
[687.32 --> 688.30]  will be thirsty again.
[688.56 --> 689.22]  But those who drink
[689.22 --> 690.32]  the water I give them
[690.32 --> 691.50]  will never thirst.
[691.88 --> 692.14]  Indeed,
[692.28 --> 693.16]  the water I give them
[693.16 --> 694.48]  will become in them
[694.48 --> 695.54]  a spring of water
[695.54 --> 697.32]  welling up to eternal life.
[698.12 --> 698.92]  Now in one sense,
[698.98 --> 699.70]  he is restating
[699.70 --> 700.46]  what he's already said.
[700.46 --> 700.74]  Like,
[701.08 --> 701.82]  I will give you
[701.82 --> 703.38]  everlasting life,
[703.54 --> 704.34]  this living water.
[704.76 --> 705.42]  But in another sense,
[705.48 --> 706.52]  he's expanding on something
[706.52 --> 707.64]  that's very profound.
[708.48 --> 708.82]  He's saying,
[708.98 --> 710.00]  the water I give you
[710.00 --> 712.32]  will well up in you
[712.32 --> 713.40]  to eternal life.
[713.92 --> 714.64]  And there's this sense
[714.64 --> 715.18]  in which this,
[715.34 --> 716.42]  what Jesus is offering her
[716.42 --> 717.62]  is not just going to heal her.
[717.98 --> 719.06]  It's not just going to restore her
[719.06 --> 719.90]  in the broken places
[719.90 --> 720.56]  of her past.
[720.76 --> 721.80]  It's actually going to bring
[721.80 --> 722.48]  that restoration,
[723.04 --> 723.60]  that life,
[723.84 --> 724.42]  to others.
[725.08 --> 725.94]  The image really,
[726.08 --> 726.52]  if you want to,
[726.70 --> 727.52]  sort of an image of this,
[727.52 --> 728.66]  it's like the life of the Spirit
[728.66 --> 729.76]  being poured into her life
[729.76 --> 731.20]  and it spills out
[731.20 --> 732.50]  into the life of others.
[732.98 --> 733.18]  Actually,
[733.20 --> 733.94]  at the end of this passage,
[733.94 --> 734.38]  you're going to see
[734.38 --> 735.70]  exactly how that works with her,
[736.00 --> 736.98]  where the life of the Spirit
[736.98 --> 738.34]  spills out to her city
[738.34 --> 739.02]  through her.
[740.40 --> 741.48]  It seems to me,
[741.82 --> 742.28]  and you know,
[742.34 --> 743.34]  when we interviewed Daniel
[743.34 --> 744.04]  last week,
[744.82 --> 745.50]  he was sharing that
[745.50 --> 746.26]  a key piece of him
[746.26 --> 747.08]  coming to faith
[747.08 --> 748.86]  was seeing the faith
[748.86 --> 749.98]  lived out in others.
[750.58 --> 751.54]  And people talking to him
[751.54 --> 752.10]  about their faith,
[752.22 --> 752.96]  people inviting him
[752.96 --> 753.40]  to worship,
[753.58 --> 754.66]  people just allowing him
[754.66 --> 755.20]  to ask questions
[755.20 --> 756.10]  without feeling foolish.
[756.14 --> 756.60]  Remember that?
[756.60 --> 758.02]  And it was striking to me
[758.02 --> 758.80]  that so much
[758.80 --> 759.98]  of his conversion story
[759.98 --> 761.88]  was seeing that life
[761.88 --> 762.90]  spilling out
[762.90 --> 763.70]  from the others
[763.70 --> 764.42]  around them.
[764.78 --> 765.76]  Seeing that living water
[765.76 --> 766.84]  just like in their actions,
[767.00 --> 767.62]  in their words,
[767.70 --> 768.32]  in what they do,
[768.38 --> 768.88]  and what they say,
[768.94 --> 769.52]  there's a sense in which
[769.52 --> 770.46]  they're being pulled in
[770.46 --> 771.28]  because they see what?
[771.90 --> 773.70]  They see living water,
[774.42 --> 775.58]  the life of the Spirit
[775.58 --> 776.28]  from Jesus,
[777.04 --> 778.38]  reanimating the lives
[778.38 --> 779.06]  of people around them.
[779.10 --> 779.28]  They say,
[779.36 --> 779.50]  okay,
[779.74 --> 780.52]  whatever that is,
[780.62 --> 781.40]  I want that
[781.40 --> 782.26]  because that's life.
[783.00 --> 783.80]  And that's what's happening,
[784.18 --> 784.36]  well,
[784.44 --> 785.28]  that's what Jesus promises
[785.28 --> 785.88]  to this woman
[785.88 --> 787.42]  if she receives that water.
[789.68 --> 790.52]  Now, remarkably,
[790.90 --> 791.80]  this woman,
[792.08 --> 793.42]  who I don't think understands,
[793.50 --> 794.10]  just like Nicodemus,
[794.18 --> 794.56]  she doesn't have
[794.56 --> 795.58]  a great sense of clarity
[795.58 --> 796.04]  about what Jesus
[796.04 --> 796.78]  is talking about,
[796.98 --> 798.24]  but whatever she does understand,
[798.34 --> 798.58]  she's like,
[798.66 --> 799.98]  I'll take it.
[800.08 --> 800.36]  She's like,
[800.36 --> 801.12]  I'll take that water.
[801.18 --> 801.84]  If it means I don't have
[801.84 --> 802.74]  to come back to this well
[802.74 --> 803.58]  and keep filling up
[803.58 --> 804.18]  a bucket of water,
[804.26 --> 805.20]  I'll take your living water.
[805.26 --> 806.04]  And maybe she's thinking
[806.04 --> 807.14]  there's some stream
[807.14 --> 807.72]  or spring
[807.72 --> 809.54]  that sort of doesn't require you
[809.54 --> 810.16]  to keep coming back
[810.16 --> 810.68]  and filling up.
[810.68 --> 811.10]  But she's like,
[811.54 --> 811.94]  I'm in.
[812.30 --> 813.16]  Whatever this is,
[813.34 --> 813.96]  I'll take it.
[815.58 --> 816.34]  And that's where
[816.34 --> 817.04]  this whole conversation
[817.04 --> 818.36]  takes a really interesting shift.
[819.42 --> 819.64]  Jesus,
[819.94 --> 820.14]  you know,
[820.22 --> 821.22]  I think he just has
[821.22 --> 821.86]  such appreciation
[821.86 --> 822.74]  for where she's coming
[822.74 --> 823.22]  with him.
[823.70 --> 824.10]  And he says,
[824.22 --> 824.44]  okay,
[825.22 --> 826.44]  go get your husband,
[827.28 --> 827.86]  come back.
[828.70 --> 830.42]  And that is a very simple request,
[830.78 --> 832.88]  but it's a loaded question.
[833.36 --> 834.26]  And he knows it
[834.26 --> 836.12]  and she knows it.
[836.16 --> 836.74]  This is where Jesus
[836.74 --> 837.54]  takes the conversation
[837.54 --> 838.80]  like five levels down.
[838.80 --> 840.46]  This is where she draws the card.
[840.90 --> 843.38]  She does not want to answer, right?
[844.12 --> 844.62]  She's like,
[844.74 --> 846.38]  how do I answer this?
[847.18 --> 848.64]  Jesus is going to this area
[848.64 --> 849.24]  where I don't want
[849.24 --> 849.98]  to talk about this.
[850.06 --> 851.20]  This is probably the area
[851.20 --> 852.42]  of greatest pain
[852.42 --> 853.52]  and shame
[853.52 --> 854.62]  and trauma
[854.62 --> 855.98]  that she has.
[856.08 --> 856.80]  And Jesus is like,
[856.84 --> 857.94]  let's talk about that.
[858.52 --> 859.28]  And he knows it.
[859.68 --> 861.06]  And she answers him honestly.
[861.56 --> 862.00]  She doesn't,
[862.26 --> 862.54]  I mean,
[862.60 --> 863.20]  she's protective,
[863.40 --> 863.96]  but she says,
[864.16 --> 865.44]  I do not have a husband.
[866.16 --> 866.34]  Right?
[867.78 --> 868.66]  And then Jesus
[868.66 --> 869.44]  really lays
[869.44 --> 870.12]  all the cards
[870.12 --> 870.66]  on the table.
[870.76 --> 871.20]  He says,
[871.98 --> 873.22]  I know about the husbands.
[874.06 --> 874.78]  I know you've had
[874.78 --> 875.38]  five husbands.
[875.84 --> 876.70]  I know that the man
[876.70 --> 877.02]  you're with
[877.02 --> 877.88]  is not your husband.
[877.96 --> 878.40]  He's probably
[878.40 --> 879.52]  somebody else's husband.
[879.84 --> 880.90]  I know about it.
[881.70 --> 882.40]  And just to give you
[882.40 --> 883.26]  a sense of the movement
[883.26 --> 884.10]  of the story so far,
[884.20 --> 885.44]  Jesus has up until this point
[885.44 --> 885.96]  been revealing
[885.96 --> 887.34]  his identity with her,
[887.94 --> 888.98]  offering her graciously
[888.98 --> 890.06]  about who he is.
[890.18 --> 891.60]  And now he's helping her see,
[892.20 --> 893.58]  you need me.
[894.54 --> 895.30]  There's a sense in which
[895.30 --> 895.56]  he says,
[895.64 --> 896.72]  you need restoration,
[897.24 --> 897.94]  you need healing
[897.94 --> 898.98]  in this broken place,
[899.20 --> 900.32]  and I'm here for that.
[900.54 --> 901.44]  You need to see
[901.44 --> 903.00]  how you need me.
[903.94 --> 904.78]  Now there's three
[904.78 --> 905.90]  really significant things
[905.90 --> 906.86]  we learn about Jesus here
[906.86 --> 908.14]  that I want us all to see.
[908.24 --> 908.86]  Number one,
[909.52 --> 910.58]  Jesus knows her heart
[910.58 --> 911.54]  without her telling her.
[912.38 --> 912.70]  I mean,
[912.98 --> 914.28]  this is a really important truth
[914.28 --> 914.98]  for every believer
[914.98 --> 915.60]  to realize that.
[915.68 --> 916.40]  Jesus doesn't need
[916.40 --> 917.22]  to be informed
[917.22 --> 918.48]  about your struggles,
[918.74 --> 919.26]  your past,
[919.36 --> 919.82]  your history,
[919.96 --> 920.38]  your fears,
[920.46 --> 920.82]  all of it.
[921.02 --> 921.86]  He knows it.
[922.18 --> 922.42]  In fact,
[922.50 --> 923.50]  already in chapter one
[923.50 --> 924.28]  when Jesus is calling
[924.28 --> 924.82]  his disciples,
[924.82 --> 926.08]  one of them is Nathaniel,
[926.16 --> 926.80]  and Jesus kind of,
[927.06 --> 927.76]  this is my image,
[927.80 --> 928.34]  he puts his hand
[928.34 --> 929.08]  on Nathaniel's shoulder
[929.08 --> 929.32]  and says,
[929.50 --> 930.56]  this is the kind of person
[930.56 --> 931.24]  you're going to be.
[931.96 --> 932.70]  And Nathaniel's like,
[933.08 --> 933.42]  whoa,
[933.56 --> 934.72]  how does he know me?
[935.96 --> 937.22]  That's how Jesus works.
[937.80 --> 938.98]  He's the son of God.
[939.46 --> 940.60]  He knows your heart.
[941.14 --> 942.20]  And when you pray to Jesus,
[942.38 --> 944.12]  you don't need to inform him
[944.12 --> 945.62]  of what's going on.
[946.04 --> 946.74]  He knows.
[948.34 --> 949.06]  Number two,
[950.54 --> 951.42]  notice the movement
[951.42 --> 952.10]  of this passage.
[952.20 --> 953.18]  I think this is so,
[953.18 --> 954.06]  so important.
[954.16 --> 955.04]  Before saying a word
[955.04 --> 955.74]  about her past,
[955.84 --> 956.66]  a word about the husbands,
[956.80 --> 957.36]  a word about the man
[957.36 --> 957.78]  she's with,
[958.16 --> 959.70]  Jesus is all grace.
[960.54 --> 960.80]  I mean,
[960.84 --> 962.00]  before he names anything,
[962.26 --> 962.72]  he just says,
[962.78 --> 962.84]  hey,
[962.90 --> 964.06]  if you ask me for a drink,
[964.14 --> 964.70]  I'm going to give you
[964.70 --> 965.34]  living water.
[966.14 --> 966.98]  And he already knows
[966.98 --> 967.60]  what's going on.
[967.66 --> 968.34]  He doesn't say a word,
[968.42 --> 968.64]  but he's like,
[968.68 --> 969.52]  but I will give you
[969.52 --> 970.26]  living water.
[970.52 --> 970.76]  Like,
[970.80 --> 972.36]  he is just so full
[972.36 --> 973.50]  of grace and mercy.
[974.30 --> 975.02]  That's a really
[975.02 --> 975.60]  important detail.
[975.66 --> 976.40]  He doesn't come in
[976.40 --> 977.06]  knocking her over
[977.06 --> 977.76]  with accusations
[977.76 --> 979.68]  or condemnation,
[980.38 --> 981.22]  which sadly,
[981.34 --> 982.60]  Christians are notoriously
[982.60 --> 983.30]  known for.
[983.52 --> 984.16]  When they see
[984.16 --> 985.18]  brokenness and sin,
[985.24 --> 985.94]  we hone in with
[985.94 --> 987.34]  accusations and condemnation.
[988.08 --> 989.58]  He comes in with grace.
[989.98 --> 991.00]  And then he makes that turn.
[991.06 --> 991.26]  He says,
[991.32 --> 992.56]  now let's talk about this.
[992.98 --> 993.14]  Right?
[994.38 --> 995.12]  And thirdly,
[995.38 --> 997.04]  even when Jesus names
[997.04 --> 998.02]  what's going on,
[998.42 --> 999.24]  he's not doing it
[999.24 --> 1000.24]  in a way that bowls her over.
[1000.44 --> 1000.86]  He says,
[1000.94 --> 1001.14]  you know,
[1001.70 --> 1002.70]  invite your husband back.
[1003.16 --> 1003.78]  And then he says,
[1003.82 --> 1004.12]  you know what?
[1004.14 --> 1004.46]  It's true.
[1004.54 --> 1005.12]  I know about this.
[1005.18 --> 1005.66]  I know about this.
[1005.74 --> 1007.22]  You have spoken accurately.
[1007.46 --> 1007.94]  There's a sense
[1007.94 --> 1008.62]  in which he's honoring
[1008.62 --> 1009.84]  and dignifying her word,
[1009.84 --> 1010.88]  and he is not
[1010.88 --> 1011.82]  coming in
[1011.82 --> 1012.48]  with the finger
[1012.48 --> 1013.24]  of accusation.
[1013.88 --> 1014.70]  He's coming in
[1014.70 --> 1015.72]  as only Jesus does,
[1015.86 --> 1016.74]  full of grace
[1016.74 --> 1018.10]  and full of truth.
[1021.86 --> 1022.30]  Now,
[1022.54 --> 1024.04]  I want to say
[1024.04 --> 1025.18]  a few words about this
[1025.18 --> 1025.86]  because I think
[1025.86 --> 1026.36]  in our context
[1026.36 --> 1027.30]  we need to understand
[1027.30 --> 1028.68]  that Jesus does
[1028.68 --> 1029.82]  still speak truth.
[1031.16 --> 1031.76]  Jesus does not
[1031.76 --> 1032.32]  sort of gloss
[1032.32 --> 1033.16]  over this past.
[1033.26 --> 1033.60]  He doesn't want
[1033.60 --> 1034.44]  to sort of avoid this.
[1034.54 --> 1035.20]  He's not like a Canadian
[1035.20 --> 1035.46]  who's like,
[1035.50 --> 1035.88]  you know what?
[1035.92 --> 1036.82]  This could cause some tension.
[1036.96 --> 1037.98]  Let's just not talk about it.
[1037.98 --> 1039.60]  Those of you
[1039.60 --> 1040.10]  who grew up here,
[1040.18 --> 1040.58]  you know this.
[1040.70 --> 1041.80]  Canadians are notoriously
[1041.80 --> 1042.60]  bad at conflict.
[1042.74 --> 1043.52]  Let's just put this
[1043.52 --> 1044.08]  under the rug.
[1044.16 --> 1045.10]  Let's not talk about this.
[1045.14 --> 1046.00]  It's going to cause tension
[1046.00 --> 1047.10]  like the truckers.
[1047.88 --> 1048.32]  Too soon?
[1048.42 --> 1048.58]  Okay.
[1049.54 --> 1050.32]  You want to know my opinion?
[1052.78 --> 1053.68]  He comes in
[1053.68 --> 1054.62]  full of grace and truth,
[1054.70 --> 1055.82]  but he speaks the truth.
[1056.74 --> 1057.92]  He speaks the truth.
[1058.02 --> 1058.46]  And one thing
[1058.46 --> 1059.18]  I have learned
[1059.18 --> 1060.14]  as I've traveled
[1060.14 --> 1060.62]  to other places,
[1060.76 --> 1061.96]  specifically I'll name Brazil,
[1062.12 --> 1062.84]  is when I got to know
[1062.84 --> 1063.38]  Christians there,
[1063.46 --> 1064.20]  especially pastors,
[1064.76 --> 1065.92]  they speak the truth.
[1066.40 --> 1067.18]  And they're not afraid
[1067.18 --> 1067.46]  to say,
[1067.54 --> 1067.72]  hey,
[1067.98 --> 1069.36]  what about this thing
[1069.36 --> 1070.16]  going on in your life?
[1070.20 --> 1071.20]  Can we talk about this?
[1071.22 --> 1072.16]  We need to have a conversation.
[1072.46 --> 1073.72]  We need to flip this card up
[1073.72 --> 1074.46]  and you need to answer
[1074.46 --> 1075.02]  this question.
[1075.84 --> 1076.98]  And Jesus will do that.
[1077.50 --> 1078.78]  And whether you like it or not,
[1079.12 --> 1079.70]  Jesus' ministry
[1079.70 --> 1081.12]  is full of confrontation.
[1082.38 --> 1082.64]  I mean,
[1082.68 --> 1083.02]  he's the one
[1083.02 --> 1083.70]  who heals the leper
[1083.70 --> 1084.50]  and flips the table
[1084.50 --> 1085.32]  of the Jewish people.
[1086.04 --> 1086.94]  He is not afraid
[1086.94 --> 1087.44]  of confrontation.
[1087.84 --> 1089.06]  And there's a reason for that.
[1089.58 --> 1090.40]  Because he knows
[1090.40 --> 1091.42]  it's the way to life.
[1091.78 --> 1091.94]  Right?
[1092.58 --> 1094.36]  It's the way to life.
[1095.28 --> 1095.88]  A number of years ago,
[1095.92 --> 1096.42]  I read a story
[1096.42 --> 1096.98]  about a man
[1096.98 --> 1097.68]  who came to faith
[1097.68 --> 1098.34]  later in life.
[1099.00 --> 1099.62]  And he described
[1099.62 --> 1100.06]  his conversion
[1100.06 --> 1101.00]  in such an interesting way.
[1101.08 --> 1101.24]  He says,
[1101.30 --> 1102.26]  when I first came to faith,
[1102.32 --> 1103.62]  I knew so little about Jesus.
[1103.74 --> 1104.22]  And he was,
[1104.72 --> 1104.74]  quote,
[1104.86 --> 1105.94]  the lamb to me.
[1106.02 --> 1106.78]  He was gentle.
[1107.58 --> 1109.10]  He was self-sacrificing.
[1109.16 --> 1109.70]  This was Jesus.
[1110.08 --> 1110.24]  He says,
[1110.30 --> 1111.44]  but as I grew in my faith
[1111.44 --> 1112.00]  and I read more
[1112.00 --> 1112.36]  of the scriptures,
[1112.46 --> 1112.76]  I realized
[1112.76 --> 1113.96]  he's not just the lamb.
[1114.66 --> 1115.96]  He's also a lion.
[1116.80 --> 1117.86]  And you don't mess
[1117.86 --> 1118.48]  with lions.
[1118.56 --> 1119.32]  You don't play games
[1119.32 --> 1119.74]  with lions.
[1119.80 --> 1120.38]  You don't toy
[1120.38 --> 1120.96]  with lions.
[1120.96 --> 1121.54]  And he said,
[1121.68 --> 1122.48]  the sign of him
[1122.48 --> 1123.30]  growing in faith
[1123.30 --> 1123.70]  is realizing
[1123.70 --> 1124.08]  that Jesus
[1124.08 --> 1125.32]  is both the lamb,
[1125.78 --> 1126.28]  gentle,
[1126.94 --> 1127.76]  self-sacrificing,
[1127.92 --> 1129.00]  and he is powerful
[1129.00 --> 1130.34]  and not to be toyed with.
[1130.92 --> 1133.22]  He is the full embodiment
[1133.22 --> 1134.06]  of grace
[1134.06 --> 1135.94]  and truth.
[1136.98 --> 1137.48]  And the reason
[1137.48 --> 1138.36]  I say this in Canada
[1138.36 --> 1139.22]  is because we often
[1139.22 --> 1139.82]  morph Jesus
[1139.82 --> 1140.62]  into our own image
[1140.62 --> 1141.24]  and we want Jesus
[1141.24 --> 1141.88]  to be sort of
[1141.88 --> 1143.08]  a Canadian Jesus
[1143.08 --> 1144.12]  who's just affirming,
[1144.64 --> 1145.44]  who's just loving,
[1145.54 --> 1146.32]  who's all grace
[1146.32 --> 1147.80]  and will never say a word
[1147.80 --> 1148.94]  about what needs
[1148.94 --> 1149.82]  to be talked about.
[1149.82 --> 1152.40]  Jesus opens up
[1152.40 --> 1153.02]  the question.
[1153.96 --> 1154.34]  He says,
[1154.74 --> 1156.70]  this needs to be addressed,
[1156.76 --> 1157.84]  not for condemnation,
[1157.98 --> 1158.76]  not for accusation,
[1158.82 --> 1159.70]  because in him,
[1159.92 --> 1161.52]  as it comes to light,
[1162.00 --> 1162.58]  that person,
[1162.72 --> 1163.48]  whoever it is,
[1163.76 --> 1164.64]  will experience
[1164.64 --> 1165.98]  renewal and forgiveness.
[1167.24 --> 1168.12]  And so much
[1168.12 --> 1168.76]  of the New Testament
[1168.76 --> 1169.58]  writers,
[1169.68 --> 1170.16]  not just Jesus,
[1170.24 --> 1170.50]  are saying,
[1170.60 --> 1171.32]  let's bring what's
[1171.32 --> 1171.86]  in the dark.
[1172.70 --> 1173.42]  Let's bring it
[1173.42 --> 1174.12]  to the light
[1174.12 --> 1175.16]  and let's find
[1175.16 --> 1175.74]  restoration
[1175.74 --> 1176.66]  and forgiveness
[1176.66 --> 1177.38]  and healing
[1177.38 --> 1178.86]  in Jesus' name.
[1180.38 --> 1180.78]  Now,
[1181.62 --> 1182.34]  I want to be
[1182.34 --> 1182.92]  even more bold
[1182.92 --> 1183.62]  with you and say,
[1183.94 --> 1184.72]  we can know this
[1184.72 --> 1185.42]  in our heads,
[1185.54 --> 1186.60]  but we suck at this
[1186.60 --> 1187.20]  in practice.
[1187.86 --> 1188.00]  Right?
[1188.06 --> 1188.24]  We're like,
[1188.30 --> 1188.50]  yes,
[1188.58 --> 1189.16]  things need to come
[1189.16 --> 1189.48]  to the light.
[1189.54 --> 1190.14]  That's great,
[1190.42 --> 1191.54]  but not my things.
[1192.32 --> 1193.04]  That woman's thing,
[1193.12 --> 1193.24]  yeah,
[1193.28 --> 1194.26]  let's talk about those
[1194.26 --> 1195.06]  or that guy's things
[1195.06 --> 1195.40]  over there,
[1195.46 --> 1196.04]  let's talk about those,
[1196.10 --> 1196.52]  but you know what,
[1196.56 --> 1197.86]  let's keep a nice lid
[1197.86 --> 1199.12]  sealed on that issue.
[1199.38 --> 1200.64]  I'm not talking to my friends
[1200.64 --> 1201.40]  about this problem
[1201.40 --> 1202.48]  and I certainly ain't
[1202.48 --> 1203.72]  praying to Jesus
[1203.72 --> 1204.70]  about this problem,
[1204.82 --> 1205.54]  even though he knows it.
[1205.54 --> 1207.32]  We have this
[1207.32 --> 1208.90]  unbelievable disconnect
[1208.90 --> 1209.96]  between what we know
[1209.96 --> 1210.78]  Christianity is about,
[1210.90 --> 1211.76]  bringing things to light,
[1212.16 --> 1213.12]  just living in light
[1213.12 --> 1213.68]  of his forgiveness
[1213.68 --> 1214.52]  and the practice
[1214.52 --> 1214.78]  of saying,
[1214.86 --> 1215.30]  you know what,
[1215.76 --> 1216.74]  let's keep that in the dark.
[1217.76 --> 1218.52]  Tell me I'm wrong
[1218.52 --> 1219.50]  and I'm speaking
[1219.50 --> 1220.28]  to myself here.
[1220.84 --> 1221.78]  I have this tendency
[1221.78 --> 1225.18]  and what's striking
[1225.18 --> 1225.78]  to me
[1225.78 --> 1227.60]  is that for some,
[1227.68 --> 1228.06]  actually I should
[1228.06 --> 1228.54]  tell the story,
[1228.62 --> 1229.52]  last week in Surge,
[1229.70 --> 1229.96]  we were,
[1230.10 --> 1230.60]  our Surge group,
[1230.68 --> 1231.40]  our discipleship group
[1231.40 --> 1232.04]  that meets every week,
[1232.10 --> 1232.44]  we were just talking
[1232.44 --> 1233.12]  about just milestones
[1233.12 --> 1234.00]  of faith in our life
[1234.00 --> 1235.44]  and a few of us named
[1235.44 --> 1237.42]  that significant turning
[1237.42 --> 1238.46]  points in our faith life
[1238.46 --> 1240.42]  were confrontation.
[1241.86 --> 1242.82]  Is that true for you?
[1243.66 --> 1244.58]  Think about your own story.
[1244.80 --> 1245.54]  A significant moment
[1245.54 --> 1246.14]  for me is like,
[1246.24 --> 1247.12]  my parents confronting
[1247.12 --> 1247.86]  habits in my life
[1247.86 --> 1248.70]  that needed to be addressed.
[1249.66 --> 1250.26]  That's significant.
[1250.34 --> 1250.80]  That's a gift
[1250.80 --> 1251.36]  that parents bring
[1251.36 --> 1251.66]  to children,
[1251.74 --> 1252.54]  whether you like it or not.
[1253.00 --> 1253.64]  For many of us,
[1253.68 --> 1254.90]  it's a friend or a roommate
[1254.90 --> 1255.82]  who is getting to know us,
[1255.88 --> 1256.58]  they see our habits more
[1256.58 --> 1257.32]  and they finally say like,
[1257.60 --> 1258.62]  what is going on here?
[1258.72 --> 1259.88]  Like, why do you do this?
[1260.42 --> 1261.32]  Why are you hurting people
[1261.32 --> 1261.64]  in this way?
[1261.66 --> 1262.62]  Like, why are you addicted
[1262.62 --> 1263.02]  to this?
[1263.02 --> 1263.82]  Whatever it is.
[1264.52 --> 1265.70]  Or, for many of us,
[1265.72 --> 1267.08]  a turning point is a spouse
[1267.08 --> 1269.24]  who you cannot hide from
[1269.24 --> 1271.00]  naming what needs
[1271.00 --> 1271.80]  to be named.
[1272.98 --> 1273.40]  And none of us
[1273.40 --> 1274.58]  like being confronted.
[1274.74 --> 1275.52]  None of us like someone
[1275.52 --> 1276.36]  like piercing us
[1276.36 --> 1277.58]  with truth about our own lives,
[1277.64 --> 1278.62]  holding up the mirror to us.
[1278.98 --> 1279.24]  And yet,
[1279.28 --> 1279.88]  these are the moments
[1279.88 --> 1280.24]  where it's like,
[1280.32 --> 1282.96]  okay, it's out in the light.
[1283.26 --> 1284.40]  It's no longer in the dark.
[1284.54 --> 1285.64]  Now I can deal with it.
[1286.20 --> 1287.50]  And those are the moments
[1287.50 --> 1288.20]  of transformation.
[1289.00 --> 1289.74]  Those are the moments
[1289.74 --> 1290.60]  where the life of Jesus
[1290.60 --> 1291.38]  can come in
[1291.38 --> 1292.16]  and bring life
[1292.16 --> 1292.92]  and restoration
[1292.92 --> 1293.92]  to those places
[1293.92 --> 1294.32]  of darkness
[1294.32 --> 1295.26]  and pain and shame.
[1296.96 --> 1298.02]  I hope you know
[1298.02 --> 1298.90]  exactly what I'm talking
[1298.90 --> 1299.70]  about in experience.
[1301.06 --> 1302.10]  And here's the best part
[1302.10 --> 1302.60]  of the story.
[1303.30 --> 1304.72]  The best part of the story,
[1304.84 --> 1305.56]  in my opinion,
[1306.30 --> 1306.82]  is Jesus,
[1306.96 --> 1308.06]  when he brings us to light,
[1308.76 --> 1309.50]  when he names
[1309.50 --> 1310.30]  this past of hers,
[1310.36 --> 1311.08]  which, by the way,
[1311.18 --> 1311.92]  I didn't say earlier,
[1312.00 --> 1312.66]  but I want to name,
[1312.66 --> 1314.20]  I don't think she is
[1314.20 --> 1315.16]  the perpetrator
[1315.16 --> 1315.94]  in all of that
[1315.94 --> 1316.62]  which is going on.
[1316.64 --> 1317.54]  We don't give a lot of details,
[1317.68 --> 1318.38]  but I do know this.
[1318.62 --> 1319.74]  Men had a lot of power
[1319.74 --> 1320.50]  in the first century.
[1321.36 --> 1322.26]  And divorce was often
[1322.26 --> 1323.22]  initiated by men
[1323.22 --> 1323.88]  for whatever reason
[1323.88 --> 1324.30]  they want.
[1324.52 --> 1325.10]  And I do think
[1325.10 --> 1326.12]  Jesus is gentle with her
[1326.12 --> 1327.08]  in part because
[1327.08 --> 1328.76]  she has been sinned against.
[1330.60 --> 1330.96]  But,
[1331.14 --> 1332.36]  when Jesus says to her,
[1332.42 --> 1333.56]  hey, I know about the husbands
[1333.56 --> 1335.00]  and I know who you're with,
[1335.46 --> 1336.42]  he knows that
[1336.42 --> 1337.86]  she's not going to deal with this.
[1338.40 --> 1339.24]  She's not able
[1339.24 --> 1339.82]  to deal with this.
[1339.84 --> 1340.26]  In the same way,
[1340.32 --> 1340.62]  you and I,
[1340.62 --> 1341.64]  we can't go back to our past
[1341.64 --> 1342.64]  and make all things right.
[1342.70 --> 1343.84]  We can't fix the things we've said.
[1344.06 --> 1345.22]  We can't undo the things we've done.
[1345.42 --> 1346.86]  And Jesus knew that.
[1347.24 --> 1347.46]  In fact,
[1347.50 --> 1348.44]  throughout the Gospel of John
[1348.44 --> 1349.28]  and the other Gospels,
[1349.32 --> 1350.42]  you know what he's constantly doing?
[1351.44 --> 1352.56]  He's performing signs,
[1352.68 --> 1353.34]  performing miracles,
[1353.48 --> 1354.14]  teaching about the kingdom,
[1354.26 --> 1355.08]  and he's constantly
[1355.08 --> 1355.92]  telling his disciples,
[1356.40 --> 1357.12]  just so you know,
[1357.56 --> 1358.62]  I'm going to the cross.
[1360.06 --> 1361.76]  I know why I have come.
[1361.90 --> 1363.36]  I know why the Father sent me.
[1363.50 --> 1364.68]  In three short years,
[1364.80 --> 1365.88]  I'm going to be killed
[1365.88 --> 1366.44]  on a cross.
[1366.50 --> 1367.24]  And I'm going to rise.
[1367.50 --> 1368.36]  He also predicts that.
[1368.74 --> 1369.72]  But he's constantly
[1369.72 --> 1370.60]  reminding his disciples
[1370.62 --> 1371.90]  who know what he's up to.
[1372.30 --> 1373.34]  This is going to finish
[1373.34 --> 1375.50]  with me dealing with
[1375.50 --> 1376.84]  your brokenness.
[1377.64 --> 1378.54]  This story is going to finish
[1378.54 --> 1380.12]  with me taking your sin,
[1380.42 --> 1381.10]  your brokenness,
[1381.24 --> 1381.74]  your shame,
[1382.02 --> 1382.56]  to the grave
[1382.56 --> 1383.76]  so that you can be liberated
[1383.76 --> 1384.48]  in my resurrection,
[1384.90 --> 1385.72]  you can be forgiven
[1385.72 --> 1386.60]  in the cross,
[1386.74 --> 1388.12]  and you can have new life,
[1388.50 --> 1389.10]  living water,
[1389.26 --> 1389.88]  eternal life,
[1390.06 --> 1390.54]  through me.
[1393.42 --> 1394.30]  That's beautiful.
[1395.56 --> 1396.32]  And whatever it is
[1396.32 --> 1396.96]  that we have,
[1397.04 --> 1397.14]  you know,
[1397.18 --> 1397.78]  whatever card
[1397.78 --> 1398.78]  that we don't want to answer,
[1398.88 --> 1399.70]  the questions that we want
[1399.70 --> 1400.72]  to keep tightly hidden
[1400.72 --> 1401.22]  in the dark,
[1401.64 --> 1403.04]  Jesus' word to us is,
[1403.42 --> 1404.42]  when that comes to light,
[1404.84 --> 1405.62]  and it comes to light
[1405.62 --> 1406.60]  in light of my grace,
[1406.94 --> 1408.46]  I take it for you.
[1409.10 --> 1409.32]  I mean,
[1409.36 --> 1410.72]  this is Christianity 101.
[1411.24 --> 1411.98]  And this is one of the reasons
[1411.98 --> 1412.90]  so many people come to faith.
[1412.98 --> 1413.04]  Like,
[1413.12 --> 1414.18]  I can't face this.
[1414.46 --> 1415.24]  I can't undo
[1415.24 --> 1416.06]  all the sin of my life.
[1416.12 --> 1417.52]  But Jesus can.
[1418.50 --> 1419.92]  And Jesus does.
[1419.92 --> 1419.96]  And Jesus does.
[1419.96 --> 1424.08]  Now,
[1424.14 --> 1425.34]  the woman's response to Jesus,
[1425.44 --> 1426.52]  there's so many different takes on it.
[1426.52 --> 1427.40]  I'm just going to give you mine.
[1427.66 --> 1428.68]  People have different opinions.
[1429.50 --> 1430.64]  But I think when Jesus says,
[1430.72 --> 1431.54]  I know about the husband,
[1431.68 --> 1432.06]  she's like,
[1432.20 --> 1434.60]  I can see that you're a prophet.
[1435.26 --> 1436.24]  You know things about me
[1436.24 --> 1437.28]  that other people don't know.
[1437.80 --> 1438.78]  But then she does
[1438.78 --> 1439.72]  what a lot of us
[1439.72 --> 1440.70]  are tempted to do,
[1441.04 --> 1441.72]  in my opinion,
[1441.82 --> 1442.68]  when we get confronted,
[1442.80 --> 1443.88]  and that is deflect.
[1444.58 --> 1445.48]  So Jesus is like,
[1445.52 --> 1446.20]  I know about the husband.
[1446.28 --> 1446.54]  She's like,
[1446.60 --> 1446.88]  hey,
[1447.24 --> 1448.08]  we should talk about,
[1448.08 --> 1449.20]  like worship on this mountain.
[1449.40 --> 1450.52]  And Samaritans say this.
[1450.56 --> 1451.36]  And Jews say this.
[1451.50 --> 1452.06]  And we need to have
[1452.06 --> 1453.54]  a theological discussion about this.
[1453.84 --> 1454.86]  And I think Jesus is like,
[1455.34 --> 1455.68]  no,
[1455.94 --> 1456.16]  no,
[1456.24 --> 1456.40]  no,
[1456.44 --> 1456.56]  no.
[1456.96 --> 1458.26]  And he sort of centralizes
[1458.26 --> 1458.72]  the conversation.
[1458.92 --> 1459.04]  He says,
[1459.24 --> 1459.90]  just so you know,
[1459.98 --> 1460.72]  the center of it all
[1460.72 --> 1462.72]  is who is worshiped.
[1462.72 --> 1463.44]  And true worship
[1463.44 --> 1464.34]  is to the Father
[1464.34 --> 1465.50]  by the Spirit
[1465.50 --> 1467.56]  who helps people see me.
[1468.74 --> 1469.48]  But then she says
[1469.48 --> 1470.38]  something that's mysterious.
[1470.50 --> 1471.10]  And I don't even know
[1471.10 --> 1472.20]  exactly how to interpret it.
[1472.22 --> 1472.50]  She says,
[1472.56 --> 1472.62]  hey,
[1472.68 --> 1473.90]  I know the Messiah is coming.
[1473.94 --> 1475.42]  So she's naming the Messiah.
[1475.92 --> 1476.62]  And when he comes,
[1476.70 --> 1477.42]  he's going to sort out
[1477.42 --> 1478.00]  all these things.
[1478.20 --> 1478.92]  Some of which I don't think
[1478.92 --> 1479.76]  she even understands
[1479.76 --> 1480.34]  in this conversation.
[1480.78 --> 1481.60]  So he's going to come.
[1481.66 --> 1482.58]  He's going to make things clear.
[1482.86 --> 1483.54]  And this is like
[1483.54 --> 1484.60]  my favorite part of the passage.
[1485.56 --> 1486.66]  Jesus looks at her.
[1487.04 --> 1487.94]  And he doesn't just speak.
[1488.32 --> 1490.48]  He declares to her,
[1490.90 --> 1492.78]  the one of whom you speak,
[1493.52 --> 1495.66]  I am he.
[1497.62 --> 1499.08]  He just lets her know
[1499.08 --> 1500.46]  that Messiah,
[1500.86 --> 1503.84]  he's standing face to face with you.
[1504.80 --> 1505.66]  And just to let this
[1505.66 --> 1506.94]  wash over you,
[1507.10 --> 1507.96]  like this is amazing.
[1508.08 --> 1509.12]  Jesus did not say this
[1509.12 --> 1509.86]  first to his disciples.
[1510.14 --> 1510.84]  He didn't even say this
[1510.84 --> 1511.46]  to Nicodemus.
[1511.62 --> 1512.98]  He made the full disclosure
[1512.98 --> 1513.60]  of his identity
[1513.60 --> 1515.30]  to the Samaritan woman first.
[1516.08 --> 1516.76]  The outlier,
[1516.96 --> 1517.56]  the outsider,
[1517.72 --> 1518.22]  the ones that
[1518.22 --> 1519.42]  his own disciples
[1519.42 --> 1520.24]  were scandalized
[1520.24 --> 1521.46]  he was in conversation with.
[1521.68 --> 1522.18]  And he says,
[1522.58 --> 1524.18]  I am the Messiah.
[1525.14 --> 1526.10]  The living waters,
[1526.22 --> 1526.92]  they come from me.
[1527.00 --> 1527.70]  The eternal life,
[1527.76 --> 1528.34]  it comes from me.
[1528.50 --> 1529.12]  I'm the one
[1529.12 --> 1529.80]  who can give it to you.
[1529.92 --> 1531.70]  I am the Messiah.
[1532.36 --> 1532.76]  Boom.
[1533.90 --> 1534.94]  She gets the invitation.
[1535.08 --> 1535.64]  And Jesus here,
[1535.74 --> 1536.28]  in my opinion,
[1536.58 --> 1537.48]  he is embodying
[1537.48 --> 1538.36]  the very thing
[1538.36 --> 1539.28]  John says
[1539.28 --> 1540.90]  in chapter 316.
[1541.32 --> 1542.24]  Whoever believes,
[1542.96 --> 1543.64]  Jesus doesn't care
[1543.64 --> 1544.24]  that it's a scandal
[1544.24 --> 1544.84]  to talk to this
[1544.84 --> 1545.40]  Samaritan woman.
[1545.56 --> 1546.46]  He does not care
[1546.46 --> 1547.42]  what his disciples think.
[1547.58 --> 1548.04]  He doesn't care
[1548.04 --> 1548.88]  what the city will think.
[1548.94 --> 1549.52]  He's saying to her,
[1549.78 --> 1550.54]  I'm the Messiah.
[1550.86 --> 1551.98]  I offer you living water.
[1552.08 --> 1552.90]  If you ask me,
[1552.98 --> 1553.88]  it is yours.
[1555.30 --> 1555.96]  That's Jesus.
[1558.34 --> 1562.12]  So last week,
[1562.44 --> 1563.28]  with Nicodemus,
[1564.28 --> 1565.16]  the story sort of
[1565.16 --> 1565.64]  cut short.
[1565.72 --> 1565.88]  In fact,
[1565.92 --> 1566.36]  someone even asked
[1566.36 --> 1566.64]  the question,
[1566.72 --> 1567.94]  what happens to Nicodemus?
[1568.66 --> 1569.42]  With this week,
[1570.00 --> 1571.12]  as John writes the story
[1571.12 --> 1572.00]  of the woman at the well,
[1572.26 --> 1573.18]  he tells us
[1573.18 --> 1574.08]  where the story goes.
[1574.16 --> 1574.84]  And I actually just want
[1574.84 --> 1575.52]  to take my Bible
[1575.52 --> 1576.18]  and read it for you.
[1576.24 --> 1576.98]  I'll read some sections
[1576.98 --> 1577.40]  of it here.
[1577.76 --> 1578.56]  This is verse 28
[1578.56 --> 1579.82]  and then 39 and following.
[1581.02 --> 1581.96]  Then leaving her jar,
[1582.10 --> 1582.70]  her water jar,
[1582.82 --> 1583.56]  the woman went back
[1583.56 --> 1584.00]  to the town
[1584.00 --> 1584.84]  and said to the people,
[1585.20 --> 1586.50]  come see the man
[1586.50 --> 1587.10]  who told me
[1587.10 --> 1588.32]  everything I ever
[1588.32 --> 1589.06]  ever did.
[1589.88 --> 1591.08]  Could this be the Messiah?
[1591.88 --> 1592.86]  Now verse 39.
[1593.22 --> 1594.40]  Many of the Samaritans
[1594.40 --> 1595.04]  from that town
[1595.04 --> 1596.08]  believed in him
[1596.08 --> 1597.58]  because of the woman's testimony.
[1598.30 --> 1599.10]  He told me
[1599.10 --> 1600.70]  everything I did.
[1601.14 --> 1601.94]  So when the Samaritans
[1601.94 --> 1602.38]  came to him,
[1602.42 --> 1603.02]  they urged him
[1603.02 --> 1603.92]  to stay with them.
[1604.30 --> 1605.28]  He stayed two days
[1605.28 --> 1606.32]  and because of his words,
[1606.46 --> 1608.16]  many more became believers.
[1608.96 --> 1609.74]  They said to the woman,
[1609.82 --> 1610.62]  we no longer believe
[1610.62 --> 1612.02]  just because of what you said.
[1612.48 --> 1613.46]  Now we have heard
[1613.46 --> 1614.24]  for ourselves
[1614.24 --> 1615.28]  and we know
[1615.28 --> 1616.62]  that this man really is
[1616.62 --> 1619.14]  the Savior of the world.
[1621.78 --> 1623.20]  One African-American writer
[1623.20 --> 1624.30]  summarizes this story
[1624.30 --> 1625.16]  saying this is the story
[1625.16 --> 1625.58]  of a woman
[1625.58 --> 1626.56]  who came for water
[1626.56 --> 1627.76]  and she left
[1627.76 --> 1628.76]  with the well.
[1629.86 --> 1631.48]  She left with the well.
[1631.58 --> 1632.58]  She goes back to her city
[1632.58 --> 1633.42]  and just so you know,
[1633.54 --> 1634.40]  she didn't get a degree
[1634.40 --> 1634.98]  in theology
[1634.98 --> 1636.10]  between this conversation
[1636.10 --> 1636.88]  and going back
[1636.88 --> 1637.36]  to her city.
[1638.08 --> 1638.88]  All she knows,
[1639.02 --> 1639.92]  as far as I can read
[1639.92 --> 1640.30]  from this story,
[1640.40 --> 1640.76]  number one,
[1641.02 --> 1642.52]  Jesus met with her.
[1643.18 --> 1644.04]  He was present to her.
[1644.04 --> 1644.44]  Number two,
[1644.72 --> 1645.62]  Jesus knew everything
[1645.62 --> 1646.14]  about her.
[1646.36 --> 1647.20]  She said that twice.
[1647.76 --> 1648.04]  Third,
[1648.48 --> 1649.52]  Jesus made an invitation
[1649.52 --> 1650.22]  to her
[1650.22 --> 1652.54]  and Jesus was gracious
[1652.54 --> 1653.16]  with her.
[1654.34 --> 1655.12]  That was enough.
[1655.88 --> 1656.46]  And her testimony
[1656.46 --> 1657.24]  to the friends
[1657.24 --> 1657.68]  and the people
[1657.68 --> 1658.12]  in the city was,
[1658.28 --> 1658.82]  this guy knows
[1658.82 --> 1659.56]  everything about me.
[1659.60 --> 1660.22]  You've got to hear
[1660.22 --> 1660.74]  about him.
[1661.38 --> 1661.66]  And you know
[1661.66 --> 1662.12]  what's happening?
[1662.74 --> 1663.76]  The very thing
[1663.76 --> 1664.86]  Jesus said would happen
[1664.86 --> 1665.38]  is happening
[1665.38 --> 1666.04]  in real time.
[1666.54 --> 1667.10]  The spirit,
[1667.24 --> 1668.08]  the free gift of God
[1668.08 --> 1668.80]  is welling up
[1668.80 --> 1669.26]  within her
[1669.26 --> 1670.36]  and spilling over
[1670.36 --> 1670.84]  to her
[1670.84 --> 1671.64]  and through her
[1671.64 --> 1672.10]  in the city
[1672.10 --> 1672.82]  and people are saying,
[1672.90 --> 1673.56]  okay, let's hear him.
[1674.04 --> 1674.62]  Let's listen to what
[1674.62 --> 1675.28]  Jesus has to say.
[1675.54 --> 1678.42]  And they amazingly believe.
[1680.12 --> 1680.82]  And I have a feeling
[1680.82 --> 1681.32]  this woman,
[1681.48 --> 1682.52]  just like so many of us,
[1682.56 --> 1683.34]  when God uses us
[1683.34 --> 1683.96]  in conversation
[1683.96 --> 1684.74]  or uses us
[1684.74 --> 1685.52]  in the conversion
[1685.52 --> 1686.14]  of someone else,
[1686.38 --> 1687.06]  she marvels
[1687.06 --> 1687.50]  at the fact
[1687.50 --> 1688.72]  that in her ordinary life,
[1688.80 --> 1689.46]  in her ordinary
[1689.46 --> 1690.52]  broken life,
[1691.34 --> 1692.00]  the spirit
[1692.00 --> 1692.80]  of the living God
[1692.80 --> 1693.42]  moves,
[1693.82 --> 1694.68]  not just in her
[1694.68 --> 1695.24]  to bring healing,
[1695.40 --> 1696.50]  but through her
[1696.50 --> 1697.70]  to bring people
[1697.70 --> 1698.16]  to Jesus.
[1699.60 --> 1700.68]  Nobody is too far
[1700.68 --> 1701.64]  gone for restoration
[1701.64 --> 1703.52]  and nobody is too
[1703.52 --> 1704.16]  far gone
[1704.16 --> 1704.88]  for the mission
[1704.88 --> 1705.50]  of Jesus.
[1706.34 --> 1706.92]  And man,
[1707.02 --> 1707.84]  does church history
[1707.84 --> 1709.44]  have an amazing testimony
[1709.44 --> 1710.64]  of all the wrong people
[1710.64 --> 1712.04]  in the wrong places
[1712.04 --> 1713.40]  with the wrong history
[1713.40 --> 1714.78]  doing what Jesus
[1714.78 --> 1715.48]  wants them to do
[1715.48 --> 1716.38]  as the spirit of God
[1716.38 --> 1716.94]  fills them,
[1717.18 --> 1718.40]  as the cross of Christ
[1718.40 --> 1719.64]  forgives them,
[1720.14 --> 1721.18]  and as they are sent
[1721.18 --> 1722.04]  to make known
[1722.04 --> 1722.60]  the love
[1722.60 --> 1723.24]  and the grace
[1723.24 --> 1723.72]  of Jesus
[1723.72 --> 1724.86]  to all nations.
[1726.04 --> 1727.02]  That's the story.
[1727.02 --> 1729.30]  I want to read
[1729.30 --> 1730.16]  for us in closing
[1730.16 --> 1731.88]  what Jesus says
[1731.88 --> 1732.98]  in John chapter 7.
[1737.12 --> 1738.04]  On the last
[1738.04 --> 1738.74]  and greatest day
[1738.74 --> 1739.36]  of the festival,
[1740.42 --> 1741.54]  Jesus stood up
[1741.54 --> 1742.82]  and said
[1742.82 --> 1743.90]  in a loud voice,
[1743.90 --> 1744.92]  let anyone
[1744.92 --> 1746.00]  who is thirsty
[1746.00 --> 1747.80]  come to me
[1747.80 --> 1748.96]  and drink.
[1749.80 --> 1750.76]  Whoever believes
[1750.76 --> 1751.08]  in me
[1751.08 --> 1751.64]  as scripture
[1751.64 --> 1752.46]  has said,
[1753.06 --> 1755.26]  rivers of living water
[1755.26 --> 1756.64]  will flow
[1756.64 --> 1757.74]  from within them.
[1758.96 --> 1759.60]  Let's pray.
[1764.90 --> 1765.50]  Father,
[1765.58 --> 1766.44]  as we just dwell
[1766.44 --> 1767.58]  in this story right now,
[1767.94 --> 1768.62]  we pray that it would
[1768.62 --> 1769.24]  move beyond
[1769.24 --> 1770.00]  just a story,
[1770.46 --> 1771.38]  just beyond information
[1771.38 --> 1772.18]  from the past
[1772.18 --> 1774.14]  and into good news
[1774.14 --> 1775.24]  for our lives.
[1776.22 --> 1776.64]  Lord,
[1776.70 --> 1777.42]  I pray that even
[1777.42 --> 1777.94]  this week,
[1778.64 --> 1780.08]  your spirit would move
[1780.08 --> 1780.90]  so that the places
[1780.90 --> 1781.52]  of darkness
[1781.52 --> 1782.44]  in our lives
[1782.44 --> 1783.44]  would come
[1783.44 --> 1784.02]  to the light.
[1785.26 --> 1786.06]  we pray that we
[1786.06 --> 1786.46]  would invite
[1786.46 --> 1787.00]  your grace
[1787.00 --> 1787.80]  into the most
[1787.80 --> 1788.38]  broken,
[1788.58 --> 1789.14]  hidden pieces
[1789.14 --> 1790.02]  of our lives
[1790.02 --> 1791.36]  so that you
[1791.36 --> 1792.04]  would put us
[1792.04 --> 1792.76]  back together.
[1794.34 --> 1795.20]  More than that,
[1795.28 --> 1795.40]  Lord,
[1795.44 --> 1796.28]  we pray that like
[1796.28 --> 1796.86]  this woman,
[1797.50 --> 1798.18]  we would return
[1798.18 --> 1799.12]  to our workplaces,
[1799.74 --> 1800.26]  our neighborhoods,
[1800.64 --> 1801.44]  and our community
[1801.44 --> 1802.78]  as those who
[1802.78 --> 1803.82]  point to the one
[1803.82 --> 1804.90]  who knows
[1804.90 --> 1806.32]  everything about us
[1806.32 --> 1807.48]  and offers us
[1807.48 --> 1808.56]  living water.
[1809.28 --> 1810.30]  To you be the glory.
[1810.72 --> 1810.96]  Amen.
[1810.96 --> 1811.10]  Amen.
[1811.10 --> 1815.34]  I invite you
[1815.34 --> 1815.88]  to stand
[1815.88 --> 1816.62]  and sing with me
[1816.62 --> 1817.86]  a song of response
[1817.86 --> 1818.88]  that celebrates
[1818.88 --> 1819.30]  forgiveness.
[1819.30 --> 1821.30]  this.
