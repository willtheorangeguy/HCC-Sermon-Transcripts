[0.42 --> 3.64]  Well, I hope we're going to continue our series in the Gospel of John.
[4.40 --> 8.68]  And this morning we're looking at the seventh and the final I Am statement that Jesus makes,
[8.80 --> 10.58]  and that is that He is the vine.
[11.28 --> 14.80]  And so if you have your Bible, either on your phone or a physical Bible,
[14.92 --> 16.92]  I invite you to turn with me to John chapter 15,
[17.16 --> 20.56]  and we're going to read Jesus speaking of His identity as the true vine.
[30.00 --> 34.80]  I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.
[35.62 --> 38.36]  He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit,
[38.76 --> 42.98]  while every branch that does bear fruit He prunes so that it will become even more fruitful.
[43.98 --> 47.34]  You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
[48.20 --> 51.42]  Remain in me, as I also remain in you.
[52.18 --> 54.36]  No branch can bear fruit by itself.
[54.36 --> 56.36]  It must remain in the vine.
[56.36 --> 60.02]  Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.
[60.74 --> 61.90]  I am the vine.
[62.72 --> 63.72]  You are the branches.
[64.34 --> 67.78]  If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.
[68.56 --> 70.72]  Apart from me, you can do nothing.
[71.62 --> 75.74]  If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers.
[76.36 --> 79.10]  Such branches are picked up and thrown in the fire and burned.
[79.84 --> 82.10]  If you remain in me and my words remain in you,
[82.22 --> 84.64]  ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you.
[84.64 --> 88.08]  This is to my Father's glory that you bear much fruit,
[88.50 --> 91.10]  showing yourselves to be my disciples.
[92.14 --> 94.70]  As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you.
[95.38 --> 96.74]  Now remain in my love.
[97.44 --> 100.52]  If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love,
[100.98 --> 104.58]  just as I have kept my Father's commands and remain in His love.
[104.58 --> 110.72]  I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.
[111.62 --> 115.12]  My command is this, love each other as I have loved you.
[115.54 --> 120.66]  Greater love has no one than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends.
[120.66 --> 124.44]  You are my friends if you do what I command.
[125.08 --> 128.84]  I no longer call you servants because servants do not know their master's business.
[128.96 --> 131.32]  Instead, I have called you friends.
[132.02 --> 134.98]  For everything that I have learned from my Father, I have made known to you.
[135.72 --> 140.50]  You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you might go and bear fruit,
[140.66 --> 141.80]  fruit that will last.
[142.20 --> 145.50]  And so that whatever you ask in my name, the Father will give you.
[146.10 --> 147.14]  This is my command.
[148.12 --> 148.90]  Love each other.
[154.64 --> 157.82]  Well, last week, while traveling for my study leave,
[158.46 --> 163.16]  I was sitting beside the plane with this young guy in his 20s who was from Toronto.
[164.28 --> 167.24]  Young, worked in the trades, he was jacked, he was sitting in his seat,
[167.30 --> 169.48]  but his muscles were in my seat, you know.
[169.98 --> 172.02]  He was giving Wes a run for his money.
[172.10 --> 172.74]  Are you here, Wes?
[172.74 --> 178.20]  And, you know, we were chatting about Toronto and Vancouver and the differences of our city.
[178.44 --> 180.32]  And, you know, after a few minutes, we settled in.
[180.38 --> 182.92]  I pulled up my book, and he started watching a movie on his phone.
[183.26 --> 186.28]  And I noticed by looking over his shoulder that he watched the same movie
[186.28 --> 190.12]  that I had downloaded to watch later, which is The Atom Project with Ryan Reynolds.
[191.26 --> 194.02]  But an hour or so into the flight, the food cart came by,
[194.14 --> 195.82]  and he paused his movie to get something.
[196.06 --> 197.38]  And I leaned over to him, and I said,
[197.42 --> 199.90]  Hey, I downloaded that movie to watch later.
[199.94 --> 200.98]  How is it going so far?
[200.98 --> 205.08]  And he turns to me, and no joke, his eyes are red, and he's tearing up.
[205.64 --> 207.20]  And he said, Man, I've got to level with you.
[207.52 --> 208.74]  This movie is making me weepy.
[210.00 --> 211.24]  And that got my attention.
[211.34 --> 213.96]  I'm like, Okay, this is a 20-year-old jack guy from Toronto,
[214.04 --> 215.48]  and he's crying on the plane.
[216.46 --> 217.84]  So I watched the movie.
[218.86 --> 220.78]  And interesting, just total coincidence.
[220.90 --> 223.96]  There was a point at which someone just started cutting onions on that flight.
[224.68 --> 225.64]  Very coincidental.
[225.64 --> 231.38]  I can either confirm or deny that I shared that same experience.
[231.86 --> 232.74]  So here's the scene.
[232.94 --> 234.16]  And I don't want to give away the plot of the movie,
[234.24 --> 236.60]  but it's The Atom Project, and the main character, his name is Adam.
[237.10 --> 240.94]  And he's in his late 30s, very competent guy, living a very interesting life.
[241.08 --> 244.50]  But there's this hole in him, and there's this theme actually throughout the whole movie,
[244.64 --> 246.82]  and that hole is the distance he has from his dad.
[247.78 --> 250.62]  He has a very distant relationship with his dad, hasn't talked to his dad in years,
[250.62 --> 254.20]  and there's just this absence there and a bitterness there, you know?
[254.30 --> 255.42]  And people ask him about it.
[255.46 --> 257.60]  You can sense that he has a resentment towards his dad.
[258.32 --> 261.92]  Through a series of events, Adam gets to meet his dad.
[262.20 --> 263.24]  Not going to give away the plot, how?
[264.06 --> 266.42]  And after a significant experience they both had,
[266.48 --> 270.86]  the dad standing face-to-face with Adam knows how Adam feels about him.
[270.90 --> 273.78]  He just says to him, Adam, I love you.
[274.52 --> 277.62]  You're my boy, and I love you.
[277.62 --> 281.06]  I saw when you were born, and after that everything changed.
[281.10 --> 283.24]  You're my boy, and I love you.
[283.60 --> 285.60]  At that point, Adam's crying.
[285.82 --> 287.72]  So is every viewer, at least allegedly.
[289.18 --> 291.92]  And, you know, Adam says to his dad, Dad, I get it, I get it.
[291.94 --> 293.84]  And his dad says, I don't think you do.
[294.38 --> 296.28]  He throws his arms around him, and he says it again.
[296.34 --> 298.58]  You're my boy, and I love you.
[298.66 --> 302.80]  And then he says, don't carry this around anymore.
[302.80 --> 310.84]  Now, I share this story because I think, if we're honest as Christians,
[311.00 --> 313.68]  many of us live just like Adam.
[315.04 --> 318.82]  We go through our whole lives knowing that we should have this relationship
[318.82 --> 320.70]  with the Father, our Heavenly Father.
[320.88 --> 323.44]  We should be close to him, but we're not.
[323.98 --> 327.22]  And we carry around this absence, this hole in our lives,
[327.30 --> 329.70]  this sense of distance we have from him.
[329.70 --> 332.60]  It's like we know Jesus is important.
[332.78 --> 336.12]  We know we're supposed to be following him, but there's just that distance.
[337.72 --> 340.28]  And there comes a time in many of our lives, I think,
[341.16 --> 343.36]  where we just have to stop and ask the question,
[343.50 --> 345.42]  is this what we signed up for?
[346.00 --> 348.90]  Is the person that we've said and we're committed to following,
[349.06 --> 351.98]  why are we feeling so distant from him all the time?
[352.04 --> 353.72]  Is this what Christianity is?
[354.36 --> 356.92]  Why is there so much distance?
[356.92 --> 360.96]  Then we get to a passage like John 15,
[362.02 --> 365.18]  where Jesus just cuts right to our hearts, honestly.
[365.38 --> 367.34]  I think this is a very cutting passage,
[367.60 --> 371.06]  where he opens up the fact that at the essence of the Christian faith
[371.06 --> 372.96]  is relationship.
[374.22 --> 376.90]  It's being close to Jesus.
[378.38 --> 381.90]  And we realize as we read John 15 is that the Father is not interested
[381.90 --> 384.66]  just having some laborers who do his work in the world.
[384.66 --> 387.14]  And Jesus is interested in some acquaintances.
[387.54 --> 389.22]  He wants friends.
[390.04 --> 390.96]  Did you notice that?
[391.02 --> 394.22]  That Jesus over and over again repeats that word friendship.
[395.48 --> 399.14]  He wants to open his heart and his life to these disciples
[399.14 --> 399.88]  who have been following him,
[399.92 --> 401.80]  and he wants them to know him
[401.80 --> 404.62]  and for them to be known by him.
[405.48 --> 406.50]  That's what he's after.
[407.14 --> 409.16]  That's what you and I have signed up with.
[409.16 --> 412.46]  And Jesus wants to close that distance
[412.46 --> 415.26]  between him and his followers.
[416.66 --> 417.64]  Remain in me.
[418.44 --> 419.44]  Abide in me.
[419.82 --> 420.60]  Dwell in me.
[420.64 --> 422.66]  And I will dwell in you.
[423.32 --> 424.26]  That's John 15.
[425.32 --> 426.30]  And if that happens,
[426.42 --> 427.10]  when that happens,
[427.16 --> 428.00]  as that happens,
[428.62 --> 429.52]  you're going to bear fruit.
[429.92 --> 431.72]  Fruit that you could never bear on your own.
[433.38 --> 435.08]  Now before we zoom in on this passage,
[435.16 --> 436.02]  I want to zoom out
[436.02 --> 438.58]  and just highlight the section that we're in.
[438.66 --> 440.20]  This is John 13 to 19.
[440.36 --> 442.92]  These are what people call the farewell discourses.
[443.02 --> 444.94]  Jesus is sort of preparing his disciples
[444.94 --> 446.32]  for him going to the death,
[446.80 --> 447.72]  going to the crucifixion,
[448.10 --> 448.96]  going to rise again.
[449.44 --> 451.16]  And we looked at how Jesus already predicted
[451.16 --> 451.98]  that he's going to die.
[452.30 --> 453.80]  He already predicted that he's going to rise.
[453.88 --> 455.22]  As Pastor Sid preached on last week,
[455.26 --> 455.94]  he's already predicted
[455.94 --> 457.22]  that he's going to pour out the Spirit.
[457.50 --> 459.02]  And he's preparing his disciples,
[459.14 --> 460.16]  these ordinary men,
[460.64 --> 462.62]  for life after he ascends with the Father.
[462.62 --> 465.44]  And Jesus already in this conversation
[465.44 --> 466.98]  assumes that after he ascends
[466.98 --> 468.74]  and sort of spatially distant,
[468.88 --> 469.44]  you might say,
[470.14 --> 470.62]  he's saying,
[470.80 --> 472.10]  you can abide in me
[472.10 --> 473.40]  and I will abide in you.
[474.16 --> 475.50]  We will be close
[475.50 --> 476.64]  as you dwell in me
[476.64 --> 477.56]  and I dwell in you
[477.56 --> 479.74]  and my life will live in you
[479.74 --> 481.56]  by the Holy Spirit.
[482.80 --> 484.16]  Jesus ascending to the Father
[484.16 --> 485.48]  doesn't mean any change
[485.48 --> 486.38]  in terms of the intimacy.
[486.54 --> 487.18]  In fact, some would say
[487.18 --> 489.70]  he's closer to us by the Spirit
[489.70 --> 491.36]  after he ascends with the Father.
[491.36 --> 492.90]  But the assumption he makes is
[492.90 --> 494.26]  this friendship,
[495.02 --> 496.52]  this knowing and being known,
[497.06 --> 498.96]  this will continue
[498.96 --> 501.32]  after I ascend to be with the Father.
[501.70 --> 502.62]  And that's good news for us
[502.62 --> 503.52]  this morning, by the way,
[503.78 --> 505.00]  living post-resurrection.
[507.22 --> 508.26]  It's key to realize
[508.26 --> 509.46]  that there's a big invitation
[509.46 --> 511.00]  to commitment in this passage.
[511.14 --> 511.66]  Jesus is saying,
[511.82 --> 513.56]  abide in me, dwell in me, remain in me.
[513.58 --> 514.28]  That's an invitation
[514.28 --> 515.68]  to actively participate
[515.68 --> 516.98]  in our formation,
[517.16 --> 517.74]  in our growth,
[517.84 --> 518.94]  in our relationship with Jesus.
[518.94 --> 521.04]  And he also makes outstanding,
[521.28 --> 522.72]  audacious promises
[522.72 --> 524.80]  of what he will do
[524.80 --> 525.68]  in this dynamic,
[525.82 --> 527.16]  this relationship we have with him.
[527.36 --> 528.16]  And we're going to open up
[528.16 --> 529.74]  both of those this morning.
[530.56 --> 531.78]  But first we notice
[531.78 --> 533.12]  that the dominant image
[533.12 --> 534.28]  of this whole passage is
[534.28 --> 535.44]  the vine.
[536.78 --> 538.20]  I am the vine.
[539.38 --> 540.04]  Now I didn't know
[540.04 --> 541.14]  until studying this passage
[541.14 --> 541.76]  this week
[541.76 --> 542.94]  that that image
[542.94 --> 543.74]  is not just a way
[543.74 --> 544.64]  we sort of understand
[544.64 --> 546.28]  our individual relationship
[546.28 --> 546.76]  with Jesus.
[546.76 --> 548.36]  it's a sort of
[548.36 --> 549.22]  a way of understanding
[549.22 --> 549.94]  God's relationship
[549.94 --> 550.60]  with his people
[550.60 --> 551.58]  throughout the Bible.
[551.80 --> 552.54]  The image of the vine
[552.54 --> 553.12]  goes right through
[553.12 --> 553.68]  the Old Testament
[553.68 --> 554.72]  and into the New Testament.
[555.12 --> 555.88]  It's a common way
[555.88 --> 557.14]  that Israel understood themselves.
[557.30 --> 558.44]  In fact, Psalm 80,
[559.18 --> 560.80]  it's a prayer of praise to God
[560.80 --> 561.28]  and it says,
[561.42 --> 562.94]  God, you rescued us from Egypt.
[563.06 --> 563.60]  And then he says,
[563.96 --> 565.10]  you planted us
[565.10 --> 566.90]  like a vine in Canaan.
[568.32 --> 568.96]  And the image there
[568.96 --> 569.52]  is that they would be
[569.52 --> 571.02]  this sort of flourishing vine
[571.02 --> 571.80]  that produces fruit
[571.80 --> 572.90]  for the nations to see
[572.90 --> 573.64]  as they live
[573.64 --> 574.62]  in the center part
[574.62 --> 575.64]  of the ancient Near East.
[575.64 --> 576.06]  It's this idea
[576.06 --> 577.40]  that there are flourishing people
[577.40 --> 578.96]  living in the presence of God,
[579.24 --> 580.02]  showing the fruit
[580.02 --> 580.80]  of following God
[580.80 --> 581.40]  to the nations.
[582.08 --> 583.04]  In fact, interestingly,
[583.46 --> 583.94]  I didn't know this
[583.94 --> 584.74]  until recently either,
[585.30 --> 586.38]  one, Israel had
[586.38 --> 587.12]  a short period
[587.12 --> 588.22]  of peace and prosperity.
[588.60 --> 589.14]  They actually made
[589.14 --> 589.76]  their own money.
[590.26 --> 591.22]  The image they printed
[591.22 --> 592.30]  on their coins
[592.30 --> 593.70]  was a vine.
[594.72 --> 595.46]  It was their sort of way
[595.46 --> 596.26]  of understanding
[596.26 --> 596.84]  their relationship
[596.84 --> 597.38]  with the Father,
[597.50 --> 598.70]  being a flourishing people,
[599.08 --> 599.94]  living out his instruction.
[600.06 --> 600.70]  They saw themselves
[600.70 --> 601.30]  as a vine.
[601.30 --> 603.64]  But that image
[603.64 --> 604.80]  got used against them
[604.80 --> 605.42]  by the prophets
[605.42 --> 606.20]  because the prophets
[606.20 --> 607.70]  see Israel later
[607.70 --> 608.66]  in their life in Canaan
[608.66 --> 609.40]  and they're corrupt.
[609.80 --> 609.94]  You know,
[610.02 --> 611.12]  the priests at the time
[611.12 --> 611.68]  are greedy.
[611.84 --> 612.40]  They're stealing money
[612.40 --> 612.96]  from the people.
[613.30 --> 614.20]  Never happens today.
[615.44 --> 615.86]  The people,
[616.12 --> 616.82]  that was a joke,
[616.94 --> 617.16]  by the way,
[617.22 --> 617.86]  happens all the time.
[619.00 --> 619.36]  Everywhere.
[620.14 --> 621.28]  The people were sort of
[621.28 --> 622.26]  chasing after the gods
[622.26 --> 623.00]  of the other nations.
[623.28 --> 624.02]  There was abuse
[624.02 --> 624.60]  of the poor,
[624.68 --> 625.56]  neglect of the poor,
[625.64 --> 626.88]  a sense of just idolatry
[626.88 --> 627.70]  here, everywhere.
[627.70 --> 628.88]  And the prophets,
[629.26 --> 630.28]  they stand up
[630.28 --> 631.08]  and they say to the people,
[631.50 --> 632.40]  you are becoming
[632.40 --> 633.28]  a dead vine.
[634.08 --> 634.72]  You're supposed to be
[634.72 --> 635.68]  this flourishing people
[635.68 --> 636.32]  bearing fruit
[636.32 --> 636.88]  in front of the nations
[636.88 --> 638.20]  and now you're just like them.
[638.58 --> 639.30]  You're just a vine
[639.30 --> 640.24]  that should be chopped up
[640.24 --> 641.14]  and thrown into the fire.
[641.34 --> 642.12]  You're no use
[642.12 --> 643.34]  as God's people
[643.34 --> 644.48]  living this way.
[644.58 --> 645.30]  They use that image
[645.30 --> 645.66]  of the vine
[645.66 --> 646.56]  against the people.
[647.96 --> 648.90]  And then Jesus,
[649.16 --> 650.20]  who knows his story
[650.20 --> 651.74]  and is speaking to people
[651.74 --> 652.46]  who know the story,
[652.54 --> 652.84]  he says,
[652.96 --> 655.20]  I am the true vine.
[656.48 --> 657.48]  And they're not just thinking
[657.48 --> 658.00]  of their individual
[658.00 --> 658.62]  relationship with them,
[658.68 --> 658.98]  they're thinking
[658.98 --> 660.58]  of the whole story
[660.58 --> 662.02]  of Israel's divine
[662.02 --> 662.86]  planted in Canaan
[662.86 --> 663.76]  being a dead vine,
[663.86 --> 664.68]  not producing fruit
[664.68 --> 665.16]  and Jesus says,
[665.24 --> 667.14]  now I am the true vine.
[667.50 --> 668.72]  And what he means to say is,
[669.18 --> 670.72]  Israel could not bring blessing
[670.72 --> 671.46]  and bring life
[671.46 --> 672.10]  because of sin.
[672.16 --> 673.02]  They were so corrupted
[673.02 --> 673.82]  and compromised
[673.82 --> 674.70]  by the nations,
[674.88 --> 675.90]  by their own sinful hearts.
[676.04 --> 677.16]  But Jesus isn't.
[678.12 --> 679.50]  And where Jesus goes,
[680.08 --> 681.54]  fruit is seen.
[682.08 --> 682.72]  And we've seen this
[682.72 --> 683.32]  as we walk through
[683.32 --> 684.12]  the Gospel of John,
[684.20 --> 685.04]  looking through his signs,
[685.12 --> 685.56]  his miracles,
[686.02 --> 686.48]  we've seen that
[686.48 --> 687.66]  wherever Jesus shows up,
[688.16 --> 688.82]  there's life.
[690.06 --> 691.24]  Wherever Jesus shows up,
[691.32 --> 692.40]  things are happening, right?
[693.06 --> 694.28]  Hungry stomachs are filled,
[694.42 --> 695.08]  eyes are open,
[695.16 --> 696.30]  the paraplegic can walk,
[696.58 --> 697.70]  Lazarus comes out of the grave.
[698.28 --> 699.16]  People see,
[699.30 --> 699.98]  even at a wedding,
[700.68 --> 701.80]  wine show up at the end,
[702.12 --> 703.16]  joy and celebration.
[703.32 --> 704.24]  Where Jesus goes,
[704.62 --> 705.66]  life goes.
[706.34 --> 707.20]  He's an abundant,
[707.46 --> 709.08]  fruit-producing vine.
[709.08 --> 711.12]  And this is where
[711.12 --> 712.06]  it gets really significant.
[712.66 --> 713.56]  Jesus in our passage
[713.56 --> 714.14]  is then saying
[714.14 --> 715.26]  to these new disciples,
[715.42 --> 716.52]  these young followers,
[716.66 --> 716.94]  he's saying,
[717.48 --> 717.76]  you,
[718.00 --> 719.36]  as you abide in me,
[719.88 --> 721.64]  you will also produce fruit.
[722.42 --> 723.68]  As you sort of grow
[723.68 --> 724.62]  out of my life
[724.62 --> 725.40]  and you are grafted
[725.40 --> 725.88]  into my life,
[726.08 --> 727.46]  you will produce the fruit
[727.46 --> 728.62]  that I'm producing.
[728.72 --> 729.42]  You're going to live
[729.42 --> 730.68]  that life that I'm living.
[730.98 --> 731.98]  You come and graft
[731.98 --> 732.66]  into my life
[732.66 --> 733.66]  and you will see
[733.66 --> 734.22]  transformation.
[735.36 --> 736.52]  That's what this whole image is,
[736.62 --> 737.40]  the sort of background
[737.40 --> 737.90]  of this image
[737.90 --> 738.82]  and the story of the Bible.
[738.82 --> 741.92]  If, says Jesus,
[742.10 --> 742.76]  this will happen
[742.76 --> 744.98]  if you remain in me,
[745.42 --> 746.28]  you abide in me,
[746.34 --> 747.02]  you dwell in me,
[747.16 --> 749.58]  and you allow the Father
[749.58 --> 751.38]  to prune you.
[752.50 --> 753.54]  And nobody likes pruning.
[754.98 --> 755.82]  Now, if you're a gardener,
[755.82 --> 756.48]  you sort of intuitively
[756.48 --> 757.48]  get that image, right?
[757.74 --> 758.58]  Are there gardeners here?
[759.44 --> 760.02]  No gardener?
[760.08 --> 761.10]  Oh, we have one, Ben.
[761.20 --> 762.32]  Okay, you know who you are.
[762.38 --> 763.04]  Your hands are probably
[763.04 --> 764.26]  green and dirt right now.
[764.78 --> 765.64]  I'm not a gardener,
[765.68 --> 766.40]  but gardeners get it.
[766.40 --> 767.26]  If you don't take care
[767.26 --> 767.64]  of your plants,
[767.64 --> 768.36]  you don't prune them,
[768.44 --> 769.52]  they're going to die eventually,
[769.60 --> 771.14]  or they're going to look hideous, right?
[771.70 --> 773.08]  And Jesus is saying that
[773.08 --> 774.02]  about the church,
[774.48 --> 775.12]  about his people.
[775.52 --> 776.00]  He's saying there needs
[776.00 --> 777.14]  to be pruning and withered
[777.14 --> 777.84]  and dying branches
[777.84 --> 778.54]  get broken off
[778.54 --> 779.16]  and they get burned.
[779.66 --> 780.66]  And there's a fair bit
[780.66 --> 781.22]  of discussion
[781.22 --> 782.54]  about what this sort of
[782.54 --> 783.96]  cutting off of the dead branches
[783.96 --> 784.70]  and throwing them
[784.70 --> 785.56]  in the fire is about.
[786.04 --> 786.86]  There's two options,
[786.96 --> 787.62]  and I'll give you both
[787.62 --> 788.76]  because I think both could work.
[788.84 --> 791.02]  One is that Jesus is speaking
[791.02 --> 792.14]  of Jews at the time.
[793.50 --> 794.56]  Jews who hear him say
[794.56 --> 795.12]  who he is,
[795.18 --> 795.70]  his identity,
[795.88 --> 796.48]  his miracles,
[796.48 --> 798.18]  sort of his being one
[798.18 --> 798.76]  with the Father
[798.76 --> 799.66]  and bringing the kingdom,
[799.82 --> 800.54]  and these Jews are saying,
[800.66 --> 801.20]  there's no way.
[801.56 --> 802.12]  There's no way
[802.12 --> 803.88]  you are the Son of the Father,
[804.08 --> 804.90]  you are the Messiah,
[805.14 --> 805.96]  and they reject him.
[806.40 --> 807.56]  And so they are the dying branches.
[807.64 --> 808.52]  They're sort of broken off
[808.52 --> 809.50]  of the life that is Jesus.
[810.24 --> 811.10]  The other option
[811.10 --> 812.02]  that several commentators
[812.02 --> 812.80]  go with is that
[812.80 --> 813.48]  these are people
[813.48 --> 814.92]  who say they believe in Jesus,
[815.20 --> 815.92]  people who initially
[815.92 --> 816.16]  are like,
[816.20 --> 816.94]  yeah, I want to follow him,
[817.08 --> 818.50]  but it's just in their words.
[818.82 --> 819.36]  There's no actually
[819.36 --> 820.58]  living relationship.
[821.26 --> 822.40]  And William Barclay
[822.40 --> 823.56]  in his commentary says
[823.56 --> 824.00]  there are people
[824.00 --> 825.42]  who render lip service
[825.42 --> 825.96]  to Jesus
[825.96 --> 827.76]  that isn't actually followed
[827.76 --> 829.54]  by living in his presence,
[830.32 --> 831.64]  following in his ways,
[832.20 --> 833.48]  and bearing kingdom fruit.
[835.34 --> 836.28]  So the two options
[836.28 --> 836.70]  are the people,
[836.78 --> 837.62]  the Jews who reject him
[837.62 --> 838.02]  or the people
[838.02 --> 839.18]  who just say they follow him,
[839.20 --> 840.44]  but there's no connection.
[840.78 --> 842.38]  There's no remaining in Jesus.
[842.70 --> 843.72]  And in both cases,
[844.18 --> 844.92]  whichever one it is
[844.92 --> 845.34]  or both,
[845.50 --> 845.96]  there's a sense
[845.96 --> 846.84]  in which they're broken off
[846.84 --> 848.06]  and they are not part of
[848.06 --> 848.80]  and attached to
[848.80 --> 850.00]  the living person
[850.00 --> 850.82]  of Jesus Christ.
[850.82 --> 852.32]  However you render it,
[852.54 --> 853.70]  I want us to hear the warning.
[854.90 --> 855.44]  Jesus is saying,
[855.60 --> 856.52]  apart from me,
[857.58 --> 859.18]  you cannot bear fruit.
[860.24 --> 861.06]  Apart from me,
[861.22 --> 862.60]  you can do nothing.
[862.74 --> 864.08]  He's being abundantly clear,
[864.14 --> 865.46]  saying I'm the source of life.
[865.82 --> 867.14]  In me is the life of the kingdom.
[867.24 --> 867.76]  If you want it,
[867.82 --> 869.52]  you need to be in me,
[869.64 --> 870.34]  remaining in me.
[870.52 --> 870.94]  Without me,
[870.98 --> 871.62]  you can do nothing.
[872.44 --> 873.66]  And you are a dead branch.
[874.82 --> 875.52]  Know that.
[876.00 --> 877.18]  And I think for Western people
[877.18 --> 877.80]  like you and I
[877.80 --> 878.50]  living in Canada
[878.50 --> 879.16]  where we're all
[879.16 --> 880.32]  so self-sufficient,
[880.44 --> 881.44]  we love running our lives,
[881.62 --> 882.60]  this is a strong word
[882.60 --> 883.22]  we need to hear.
[883.90 --> 884.84]  Apart from me,
[885.22 --> 886.34]  you can do nothing.
[887.32 --> 887.98]  Apart from me,
[888.02 --> 889.64]  you're a withering branch.
[890.36 --> 891.40]  So remain in me.
[891.46 --> 892.10]  There's the warning.
[894.40 --> 895.38]  Now we get to
[895.38 --> 896.86]  the dominant invitation
[896.86 --> 898.06]  of the whole passage.
[898.28 --> 898.88]  And that is,
[899.42 --> 900.38]  remain in me.
[900.80 --> 901.28]  Now I don't know
[901.28 --> 902.04]  which Bible translation
[902.04 --> 902.44]  you have.
[902.50 --> 903.48]  There's three different ones
[903.48 --> 903.92]  that I read
[903.92 --> 904.38]  and there's also,
[904.50 --> 905.20]  well I should say four.
[905.48 --> 906.12]  There's remain,
[906.72 --> 907.30]  there's abide,
[907.38 --> 907.78]  and there's dwell.
[907.78 --> 909.26]  Which one does your translation have?
[910.92 --> 911.88]  I like all three,
[912.00 --> 912.96]  so I'm using them interchangeably.
[913.08 --> 914.06]  I think I grew up
[914.06 --> 914.56]  with abide,
[914.72 --> 915.30]  and the remain,
[915.40 --> 916.30]  I don't know if you like that image,
[916.38 --> 917.60]  but one translation,
[917.80 --> 918.82]  sort of a contemporary translation
[918.82 --> 920.22]  says stay connected.
[920.80 --> 921.52]  And I like that too.
[921.60 --> 922.24]  This idea of like,
[922.28 --> 922.66]  Jesus is,
[922.82 --> 923.44]  he's going after
[923.44 --> 924.70]  relational closeness.
[925.60 --> 926.90]  Stay as close as you can
[926.90 --> 927.84]  to the source of life.
[927.94 --> 929.20]  Be grafted into.
[929.76 --> 931.02]  All of that is the same thing.
[932.06 --> 933.44]  Now there's a myriad of ways
[933.44 --> 934.90]  that we remain in Jesus,
[934.98 --> 936.20]  or we abide in Jesus,
[936.20 --> 937.78]  and stay closely connected to him.
[938.22 --> 939.24]  You know in Acts 2,
[939.42 --> 940.54]  the early church is described
[940.54 --> 941.32]  as devoting themselves
[941.32 --> 941.84]  to prayer,
[942.18 --> 942.54]  fellowship,
[942.98 --> 943.84]  the apostles teaching,
[944.24 --> 945.48]  and to the breaking of bread.
[945.56 --> 946.58]  And all of those are ways
[946.58 --> 947.66]  that we stay in Christ.
[947.74 --> 948.74]  Even worship,
[948.88 --> 949.40]  I would say.
[949.80 --> 951.10]  What we're doing this morning together,
[951.18 --> 951.74]  that is a way
[951.74 --> 952.74]  where we are grounded
[952.74 --> 954.26]  and soaking in the life of Jesus.
[955.70 --> 956.88]  Two ways that are mentioned
[956.88 --> 958.54]  specifically in our passage
[958.54 --> 960.66]  of remaining in Jesus,
[960.80 --> 961.42]  abiding in him,
[961.48 --> 962.10]  are number one,
[962.74 --> 963.10]  prayer,
[964.00 --> 964.66]  number two,
[964.66 --> 965.92]  Christ's word.
[966.62 --> 966.96]  And Jesus,
[967.10 --> 967.46]  you see that.
[967.54 --> 968.68]  He invites them
[968.68 --> 970.04]  to make requests,
[970.12 --> 970.98]  to talk with him.
[971.10 --> 971.88]  And think about this.
[971.92 --> 972.78]  If the dominant image
[972.78 --> 974.06]  Jesus uses to describe
[974.06 --> 975.22]  the dynamic of relationship
[975.22 --> 976.30]  is friendship,
[977.36 --> 978.30]  doesn't it make sense
[978.30 --> 979.02]  that Jesus wants
[979.02 --> 980.00]  to be in conversation
[980.00 --> 981.74]  with his people,
[982.14 --> 982.98]  with his followers,
[983.28 --> 983.98]  with his branches?
[984.62 --> 985.14]  Don't you think?
[985.98 --> 987.10]  And I realize as the pastor,
[987.18 --> 988.02]  whenever you bring up prayer,
[988.30 --> 989.18]  what happens in the back
[989.18 --> 990.34]  of almost everyone's mind
[990.34 --> 990.66]  is,
[991.34 --> 991.66]  ah,
[991.66 --> 991.98]  ah,
[992.22 --> 993.74]  I'm terrible at praying.
[994.58 --> 994.94]  Or,
[995.04 --> 995.28]  ah,
[995.34 --> 996.48]  I'm just so bad
[996.48 --> 997.18]  at having a routine.
[997.28 --> 997.36]  Or,
[997.42 --> 997.62]  ah,
[997.64 --> 998.50]  I get so busy
[998.50 --> 999.50]  and I never make time for it.
[999.50 --> 999.92]  I get it.
[999.96 --> 1000.42]  We all have that.
[1000.52 --> 1001.28]  Pastors have that too,
[1001.34 --> 1001.74]  by the way.
[1002.20 --> 1002.74]  Because we think,
[1002.80 --> 1003.12]  oh man,
[1003.32 --> 1003.90]  pastors are supposed to pray
[1003.90 --> 1004.56]  even more
[1004.56 --> 1005.46]  and we're not good at it.
[1005.54 --> 1006.38]  Not many of us
[1006.38 --> 1007.68]  are naturals at prayer.
[1008.48 --> 1009.38]  But here this passage
[1009.38 --> 1010.22]  is the invitation
[1010.22 --> 1010.92]  to abide
[1010.92 --> 1012.10]  in the very life of Jesus.
[1013.06 --> 1013.90]  Jesus who wants
[1013.90 --> 1014.88]  to have conversation.
[1016.02 --> 1016.48]  He wants you
[1016.48 --> 1017.38]  to share your heart
[1017.38 --> 1018.60]  and to share his.
[1018.84 --> 1019.30]  He wants you
[1019.30 --> 1020.04]  to ask questions
[1020.04 --> 1021.30]  and receive answers.
[1021.40 --> 1021.94]  He wants to be
[1021.94 --> 1022.48]  in a living,
[1022.68 --> 1023.60]  dynamic relationship
[1023.60 --> 1023.96]  with us
[1023.96 --> 1025.16]  because that's who he is.
[1025.80 --> 1026.82]  He wants to talk.
[1027.72 --> 1028.32]  I think some of my
[1028.32 --> 1029.06]  favorite experiences
[1029.06 --> 1029.92]  as a pastor
[1029.92 --> 1031.76]  are praying
[1031.76 --> 1032.68]  with new believers.
[1032.78 --> 1033.46]  Have you done that before?
[1033.98 --> 1034.82]  There's a number of people
[1034.82 --> 1035.00]  who,
[1035.10 --> 1035.24]  you know,
[1035.28 --> 1036.04]  they're very young
[1036.04 --> 1036.52]  in their faith,
[1036.60 --> 1037.10]  they're very new
[1037.10 --> 1037.66]  to the Christian faith
[1037.66 --> 1038.66]  and the way they pray
[1038.66 --> 1039.52]  is so much better
[1039.52 --> 1040.52]  than how many of us pray.
[1040.62 --> 1041.28]  No offense to you.
[1041.62 --> 1041.74]  You know,
[1041.76 --> 1042.22]  some of us have
[1042.22 --> 1043.10]  the prayer voice
[1043.10 --> 1043.34]  or,
[1043.46 --> 1043.56]  you know,
[1043.60 --> 1043.76]  after,
[1044.34 --> 1045.30]  in some of my circles,
[1045.46 --> 1045.60]  you know,
[1045.62 --> 1046.14]  when there's a prayer
[1046.14 --> 1046.96]  after the meal,
[1047.26 --> 1048.12]  it's like this different
[1048.12 --> 1049.08]  person shows up.
[1049.08 --> 1049.56]  Right?
[1049.72 --> 1050.94]  Different voice shows up.
[1051.32 --> 1051.84]  But when you pray
[1051.84 --> 1052.14]  with someone
[1052.14 --> 1052.76]  who's brand new
[1052.76 --> 1053.38]  to the Christian faith
[1053.38 --> 1054.08]  and like this one
[1054.08 --> 1054.48]  young woman
[1054.48 --> 1055.02]  we prayed with
[1055.02 --> 1055.76]  a number of years ago,
[1055.98 --> 1056.86]  she started by saying,
[1057.16 --> 1057.62]  hey God,
[1058.20 --> 1058.74]  and she finished
[1058.74 --> 1059.26]  by saying,
[1059.60 --> 1059.88]  bye.
[1061.48 --> 1062.58]  And someone was so,
[1062.64 --> 1062.84]  like,
[1062.92 --> 1063.70]  taken by that
[1063.70 --> 1064.44]  that they said
[1064.44 --> 1065.66]  amen on her behalf
[1065.66 --> 1066.12]  because they're like,
[1066.16 --> 1066.80]  you can't just say
[1066.80 --> 1067.76]  bye at the end.
[1068.02 --> 1068.52]  You're not on your
[1068.52 --> 1069.00]  cell phone.
[1070.14 --> 1070.54]  But,
[1071.10 --> 1071.52]  but,
[1071.52 --> 1072.78]  I know some of us
[1072.78 --> 1073.38]  there thought,
[1073.78 --> 1074.46]  this is a woman
[1074.46 --> 1075.18]  who's having
[1075.18 --> 1076.54]  conversation with her
[1076.54 --> 1077.00]  father.
[1078.02 --> 1079.32]  And she is talking
[1079.32 --> 1079.96]  honestly,
[1080.70 --> 1081.18]  vulnerably,
[1081.36 --> 1081.90]  and openly
[1081.90 --> 1082.82]  as someone who
[1082.82 --> 1083.42]  really just wants
[1083.42 --> 1084.12]  to talk with Jesus.
[1084.80 --> 1085.72]  And I think a lot
[1085.72 --> 1086.50]  of us envy that.
[1087.24 --> 1087.82]  And the journey
[1087.82 --> 1088.42]  that all of us
[1088.42 --> 1088.98]  need to be on
[1088.98 --> 1089.54]  if we want to be
[1089.54 --> 1090.28]  in Christ
[1090.28 --> 1091.84]  is learning to pray.
[1092.22 --> 1092.42]  In fact,
[1092.46 --> 1093.02]  Eugene Peterson,
[1093.16 --> 1093.56]  one of my favorite
[1093.56 --> 1093.86]  writers,
[1094.18 --> 1094.40]  he says,
[1094.50 --> 1095.44]  the task of pastors
[1095.44 --> 1096.34]  and Christian leaders
[1096.34 --> 1097.46]  is to help people
[1097.46 --> 1099.32]  learn to pray,
[1100.02 --> 1100.88]  which is having
[1100.88 --> 1101.74]  conversation
[1101.74 --> 1103.12]  with the father,
[1104.08 --> 1104.54]  having conversation
[1104.54 --> 1106.48]  with the son,
[1106.94 --> 1107.92]  who wants to hear you,
[1107.96 --> 1108.64]  who in verse 7
[1108.64 --> 1108.94]  invites,
[1109.10 --> 1109.58]  ask,
[1110.02 --> 1110.62]  talk to me,
[1110.70 --> 1111.38]  make your request,
[1111.48 --> 1112.04]  I want to be in
[1112.04 --> 1112.74]  conversation with you.
[1112.96 --> 1113.98]  You're my friend.
[1114.60 --> 1114.82]  Right?
[1114.86 --> 1115.22]  I'm going to come
[1115.22 --> 1116.00]  back to that part.
[1116.28 --> 1117.36]  So the number one way
[1117.36 --> 1118.08]  we abide in Christ
[1118.08 --> 1118.78]  is by prayer.
[1120.06 --> 1120.42]  Secondly,
[1121.30 --> 1122.26]  by Christ's word.
[1122.34 --> 1122.80]  And we see this
[1122.80 --> 1123.72]  in verse 7 as well.
[1123.94 --> 1124.94]  Christ speaks to us
[1124.94 --> 1125.56]  by his word.
[1125.64 --> 1126.34]  We abide in him
[1126.34 --> 1126.98]  by his word.
[1127.28 --> 1127.66]  And Christ,
[1127.80 --> 1127.94]  you know,
[1128.00 --> 1129.10]  elsewhere in his ministry,
[1129.36 --> 1130.08]  we see that when he
[1130.08 --> 1130.56]  says his word,
[1130.62 --> 1131.22]  it's not just what he
[1131.22 --> 1132.10]  says verbally in front
[1132.10 --> 1132.66]  of his disciples
[1132.66 --> 1133.14]  that's recorded,
[1133.22 --> 1134.00]  it's the whole scriptures.
[1135.34 --> 1136.16]  No one has a higher
[1136.16 --> 1136.98]  regard for the scriptures
[1136.98 --> 1137.46]  than Jesus.
[1138.60 --> 1139.54]  And Jesus knows
[1139.54 --> 1140.42]  that he is revealed
[1140.42 --> 1141.64]  to us by his word.
[1141.74 --> 1141.94]  In fact,
[1142.06 --> 1142.34]  Calvin,
[1142.50 --> 1143.06]  John Calvin,
[1143.84 --> 1144.02]  you know,
[1144.16 --> 1144.98]  sort of a famous
[1144.98 --> 1145.98]  Reformed theologian
[1145.98 --> 1146.40]  has said,
[1146.48 --> 1147.24]  and I love this image,
[1147.30 --> 1148.52]  that Christ comes to us
[1148.52 --> 1150.06]  clothed by his word.
[1150.88 --> 1151.58]  That when we open
[1151.58 --> 1152.10]  this book
[1152.10 --> 1154.18]  and we seek to understand
[1154.18 --> 1155.18]  what it means for us,
[1155.24 --> 1156.58]  that Christ ministers
[1156.58 --> 1157.28]  to us.
[1158.30 --> 1158.84]  And I've said this
[1158.84 --> 1159.58]  before here at Hope,
[1159.60 --> 1160.18]  but one of my favorite
[1160.18 --> 1161.20]  times as a youth pastor
[1161.20 --> 1162.24]  is seeing students
[1162.24 --> 1162.64]  who like,
[1162.68 --> 1162.80]  you know,
[1162.84 --> 1163.36]  this book can be
[1163.36 --> 1164.20]  overwhelming for students,
[1164.20 --> 1165.08]  but they pick it up
[1165.08 --> 1165.58]  and they read it
[1165.58 --> 1166.02]  and I used to make
[1166.02 --> 1166.80]  this challenge like,
[1166.90 --> 1167.72]  I'll give you 100 bucks
[1167.72 --> 1168.52]  if you read the whole Bible.
[1168.96 --> 1169.84]  Then students did that
[1169.84 --> 1170.88]  and I'd pay them 100 bucks.
[1171.22 --> 1172.18]  But I'd meet with them
[1172.18 --> 1173.06]  and talk to them about it
[1173.06 --> 1173.96]  and what would I hear?
[1175.16 --> 1176.70]  Christ showing up.
[1177.44 --> 1178.40]  Them reading Galatians
[1178.40 --> 1179.18]  or Ezekiel
[1179.18 --> 1180.00]  or some random
[1180.00 --> 1180.82]  Old Testament books
[1180.82 --> 1181.54]  they didn't know existed
[1181.54 --> 1183.08]  and they find themselves
[1183.08 --> 1184.10]  hearing Christ speak
[1184.10 --> 1185.36]  his word of love,
[1186.02 --> 1186.42]  mercy,
[1187.00 --> 1187.50]  power,
[1188.00 --> 1188.60]  all of it.
[1188.60 --> 1189.68]  Christ ministers
[1189.68 --> 1190.98]  to us by his word
[1190.98 --> 1191.98]  and that is one of the ways
[1191.98 --> 1193.50]  we abide in him.
[1196.48 --> 1197.32]  Now I'm guessing
[1197.32 --> 1198.00]  that as you hear
[1198.00 --> 1198.62]  these two ways
[1198.62 --> 1199.62]  that we abide in Christ,
[1199.72 --> 1200.48]  that we remain in him
[1200.48 --> 1201.84]  as prayer and the word,
[1202.28 --> 1203.80]  you're probably imagining
[1203.80 --> 1205.46]  your individual relationship
[1205.46 --> 1206.04]  with Christ.
[1206.56 --> 1207.20]  And I want you to know
[1207.20 --> 1208.52]  that's not how Jesus
[1208.52 --> 1209.46]  is imagining it
[1209.46 --> 1210.18]  in this passage.
[1210.44 --> 1211.02]  Or I should say
[1211.02 --> 1212.04]  that's not how he's speaking.
[1212.84 --> 1214.00]  Almost all the times
[1214.00 --> 1215.00]  he says the word you,
[1215.12 --> 1216.10]  as you remain in me,
[1216.16 --> 1217.10]  as you abide in me,
[1217.10 --> 1218.66]  he's not saying you individually,
[1218.74 --> 1219.12]  he's saying,
[1219.66 --> 1220.98]  as the Americans would say,
[1221.44 --> 1221.84]  y'all.
[1222.70 --> 1222.88]  Right?
[1223.32 --> 1224.28]  Second person plural,
[1224.56 --> 1225.28]  you all.
[1225.38 --> 1226.06]  We don't have a word
[1226.06 --> 1227.22]  for that that differentiates it,
[1227.24 --> 1228.08]  but he's saying y'all.
[1228.76 --> 1230.24]  And his idea is that
[1230.24 --> 1231.32]  the branches graft
[1231.32 --> 1232.20]  into him together
[1232.20 --> 1232.92]  and that it's not just
[1232.92 --> 1233.92]  this solo mission
[1233.92 --> 1235.00]  where we pray by ourself
[1235.00 --> 1235.90]  and we read the scriptures
[1235.90 --> 1237.08]  by ourselves,
[1237.20 --> 1238.14]  as important as that is,
[1238.30 --> 1238.86]  it's a sense of
[1238.86 --> 1239.44]  the whole community
[1239.44 --> 1240.04]  coming together
[1240.04 --> 1241.32]  and being grafted in him
[1241.32 --> 1242.36]  as a family.
[1244.12 --> 1245.44]  And I think that COVID,
[1245.62 --> 1246.40]  of the many things
[1246.40 --> 1247.20]  it teaches us
[1247.20 --> 1249.44]  is that we don't do well
[1249.44 --> 1250.04]  in isolation.
[1251.10 --> 1251.90]  And I say that personally,
[1252.00 --> 1253.08]  I don't do well in isolation.
[1253.58 --> 1254.80]  I don't grow well
[1254.80 --> 1255.40]  in isolation.
[1255.52 --> 1255.82]  Do you?
[1256.54 --> 1257.36]  Is your prayer life
[1257.36 --> 1257.98]  really healthy
[1257.98 --> 1259.06]  when it's only just you
[1259.06 --> 1259.44]  and Jesus
[1259.44 --> 1260.36]  and you're not praying
[1260.36 --> 1260.86]  with other people?
[1261.02 --> 1261.98]  Or your devotional life
[1261.98 --> 1262.38]  really healthy
[1262.38 --> 1262.94]  when you're not reading
[1262.94 --> 1263.32]  the scriptures
[1263.32 --> 1263.94]  with other people
[1263.94 --> 1264.94]  or joining with other believers
[1264.94 --> 1265.38]  on Sunday?
[1265.64 --> 1266.94]  I'm guessing you're like me
[1266.94 --> 1268.66]  and you not just like
[1268.66 --> 1268.98]  the community
[1268.98 --> 1270.30]  but you need the community.
[1270.88 --> 1271.60]  You need brothers
[1271.60 --> 1272.44]  and sisters in faith
[1272.44 --> 1273.08]  who encourage you,
[1273.18 --> 1273.68]  who speak to you,
[1273.80 --> 1274.70]  who pray with you
[1274.70 --> 1276.24]  so that you can grow
[1276.24 --> 1277.54]  and we can stay grafted
[1277.54 --> 1277.94]  in Jesus,
[1278.08 --> 1279.26]  the source of life,
[1280.06 --> 1280.44]  together.
[1281.34 --> 1281.98]  And for those of you
[1281.98 --> 1282.68]  who are showing up
[1282.68 --> 1283.46]  and coming back to church
[1283.46 --> 1284.10]  for the first time,
[1284.44 --> 1285.40]  this right now
[1285.40 --> 1286.16]  is one of the ways
[1286.16 --> 1287.04]  that we together
[1287.04 --> 1288.22]  graft into the life
[1288.22 --> 1288.64]  of Jesus
[1288.64 --> 1289.88]  as we pray,
[1290.00 --> 1290.36]  we sing,
[1290.42 --> 1291.26]  and we hear his word.
[1291.26 --> 1296.76]  Jesus is making
[1296.76 --> 1298.28]  a clear invitation here
[1298.28 --> 1299.10]  and I want us to know,
[1300.06 --> 1300.68]  sometimes I don't know
[1300.68 --> 1301.02]  how to say it
[1301.02 --> 1301.36]  because people
[1301.36 --> 1302.28]  can mishear this,
[1302.34 --> 1303.58]  but sometimes we imagine
[1303.58 --> 1304.30]  the Christian faith
[1304.30 --> 1305.70]  as passively receiving
[1305.70 --> 1306.34]  Jesus' grace.
[1306.44 --> 1307.20]  And don't hear me wrong,
[1307.32 --> 1307.56]  Jesus,
[1308.06 --> 1309.28]  all he gives is grace.
[1309.36 --> 1310.74]  He is very gracious
[1310.74 --> 1311.58]  and the gospel is all
[1311.58 --> 1312.56]  about what we don't deserve.
[1312.80 --> 1313.50]  But we can often
[1313.50 --> 1314.28]  see ourselves
[1314.28 --> 1315.94]  just only passively receiving
[1315.94 --> 1316.98]  and that's the posture.
[1317.34 --> 1318.56]  And don't be surprised then
[1318.56 --> 1320.44]  that we often feel stagnant
[1320.44 --> 1321.72]  and we often feel
[1321.72 --> 1322.52]  like we're stuck,
[1323.14 --> 1323.54]  distant,
[1323.72 --> 1324.52]  carrying that distance
[1324.52 --> 1325.04]  with the Father.
[1325.40 --> 1326.28]  Jesus is inviting us
[1326.28 --> 1327.90]  to actively pursue
[1327.90 --> 1329.50]  relationship with Christ,
[1329.70 --> 1331.00]  to step into it,
[1331.04 --> 1332.30]  to make a plan for prayer,
[1332.44 --> 1333.18]  to get involved
[1333.18 --> 1333.92]  with a group of people
[1333.92 --> 1335.32]  so that we together
[1335.32 --> 1337.16]  stay in the vine
[1337.16 --> 1337.74]  that is Jesus.
[1339.90 --> 1340.64]  And lest we think
[1340.64 --> 1341.66]  it's all what we do,
[1341.66 --> 1343.16]  the rest of this passage
[1343.16 --> 1343.82]  and our time together,
[1343.90 --> 1344.22]  we're going to see
[1344.22 --> 1345.44]  the incredible promises
[1345.44 --> 1346.06]  Jesus makes
[1346.06 --> 1347.32]  of what he is going to do
[1347.32 --> 1348.88]  as we remain in him.
[1349.82 --> 1350.04]  So,
[1351.06 --> 1351.64]  number one,
[1351.72 --> 1352.86]  the first thing Jesus says,
[1353.28 --> 1354.36]  when you remain in me,
[1354.44 --> 1355.50]  when you dwell in me,
[1355.86 --> 1357.52]  I dwell in you.
[1358.58 --> 1360.76]  I take up residence in you.
[1361.20 --> 1361.96]  And I'm sure Pastor Sid
[1361.96 --> 1362.82]  said this last week
[1362.82 --> 1363.46]  but I don't know
[1363.46 --> 1364.98]  because I was listening online
[1364.98 --> 1366.94]  and it was so quiet online
[1366.94 --> 1367.76]  and I don't think Sid
[1367.76 --> 1368.42]  preaches quietly
[1368.42 --> 1369.54]  so I think it was just the audio.
[1369.96 --> 1370.94]  But I'm sure Sid said this,
[1370.94 --> 1372.72]  when the Spirit is at work in us,
[1372.82 --> 1374.34]  it's Jesus taking up residence.
[1375.12 --> 1376.18]  When Paul talks about the Spirit,
[1376.26 --> 1377.30]  it's the Spirit of Christ
[1377.30 --> 1378.78]  taking up residence in us
[1378.78 --> 1380.14]  and when Jesus takes residence
[1380.14 --> 1380.92]  in us,
[1381.88 --> 1382.60]  things happen.
[1383.86 --> 1384.58]  Things happen
[1384.58 --> 1385.52]  that you could not do
[1385.52 --> 1386.08]  on your own,
[1386.24 --> 1387.10]  fruit produced
[1387.10 --> 1388.44]  that you could not produce
[1388.44 --> 1389.04]  on your own.
[1389.46 --> 1390.66]  Transformation takes place
[1390.66 --> 1391.84]  when God shows up
[1391.84 --> 1392.64]  in us by Jesus.
[1394.28 --> 1395.22]  That's good news.
[1396.18 --> 1397.04]  And there's a whole myriad
[1397.04 --> 1398.00]  of ways that happens
[1398.00 --> 1399.48]  and I could tell stories
[1399.48 --> 1400.20]  even within our church
[1400.20 --> 1401.08]  of how I see Christ
[1401.08 --> 1402.08]  taking hold of our lives
[1402.08 --> 1402.88]  and bringing transformation.
[1403.14 --> 1403.98]  But two ways
[1403.98 --> 1405.12]  are mentioned specifically
[1405.12 --> 1405.74]  in our passage
[1405.74 --> 1406.70]  in verse 9 and 10.
[1406.80 --> 1407.32]  You know what they are?
[1408.34 --> 1408.70]  Love.
[1409.90 --> 1411.02]  There is love
[1411.02 --> 1412.48]  that is the fruit
[1412.48 --> 1413.56]  of the Holy Spirit
[1413.56 --> 1414.48]  taking work in us.
[1414.68 --> 1415.18]  Number two,
[1415.74 --> 1416.18]  obedience.
[1417.78 --> 1419.32]  As we remain in Christ
[1419.32 --> 1420.12]  and Christ takes up
[1420.12 --> 1420.72]  residence in us
[1420.72 --> 1421.84]  and as He abides in us,
[1421.90 --> 1422.86]  we become people
[1422.86 --> 1424.28]  of love.
[1425.26 --> 1426.34]  And we're able to love
[1426.34 --> 1427.32]  in a new, deeper,
[1427.52 --> 1428.54]  more profound kind of way.
[1428.60 --> 1429.48]  We love our friends,
[1429.60 --> 1430.44]  our spouses,
[1431.00 --> 1431.56]  our children,
[1431.70 --> 1432.18]  our parents,
[1432.60 --> 1434.06]  our ideological opponent
[1434.06 --> 1434.68]  about COVID.
[1434.76 --> 1435.36]  Do you have one?
[1435.76 --> 1435.98]  No?
[1436.10 --> 1436.44]  Just me?
[1436.52 --> 1436.86]  Just kidding.
[1437.76 --> 1439.06]  We are able to love
[1439.06 --> 1440.58]  in a way that we are not able to
[1440.58 --> 1441.48]  when we are disconnected
[1441.48 --> 1442.20]  from the vine
[1442.20 --> 1442.82]  that is Jesus.
[1443.20 --> 1443.80]  But secondly,
[1444.02 --> 1444.84]  equally important
[1444.84 --> 1446.30]  is we are able to obey.
[1447.68 --> 1448.82]  This is just anecdotal,
[1448.92 --> 1449.68]  but in my own life
[1449.68 --> 1450.20]  as I think about
[1450.20 --> 1451.66]  the people of faith
[1451.66 --> 1452.68]  who have sort of formed me,
[1452.78 --> 1453.60]  who I love and respect,
[1453.72 --> 1454.14]  who are older
[1454.14 --> 1454.66]  and more seasoned
[1454.66 --> 1455.12]  in their faith,
[1455.32 --> 1456.46]  what is true of them
[1456.46 --> 1457.86]  as I think of them
[1457.86 --> 1459.56]  is that they take Jesus seriously.
[1461.56 --> 1461.74]  You know,
[1461.78 --> 1462.68]  sometimes when you're younger,
[1462.96 --> 1463.50]  and I can remember
[1463.50 --> 1464.06]  being this way,
[1464.26 --> 1465.42]  you almost look at the Bible
[1465.42 --> 1466.94]  like what can I get away with?
[1467.42 --> 1467.58]  Right?
[1467.76 --> 1469.02]  How far is too far?
[1469.10 --> 1470.26]  What are the loopholes
[1470.26 --> 1472.00]  that are going to keep me safe
[1472.00 --> 1473.08]  but I can still kind of
[1473.08 --> 1473.66]  do what I want?
[1473.90 --> 1474.82]  People who are mature
[1474.82 --> 1475.28]  in their faith,
[1475.34 --> 1475.78]  they're no longer
[1475.78 --> 1476.64]  looking for loopholes.
[1477.34 --> 1477.80]  They're saying,
[1477.90 --> 1479.10]  this is what Jesus says.
[1479.30 --> 1480.50]  And if Jesus is life,
[1480.78 --> 1482.66]  I desire to obey.
[1483.94 --> 1485.00]  I want to follow
[1485.00 --> 1486.20]  in the way he has prescribed
[1486.20 --> 1487.56]  because I know that's life.
[1487.88 --> 1488.86]  That's maturity in Christ.
[1488.96 --> 1489.32]  And Jesus says,
[1489.40 --> 1490.20]  as I abide in you,
[1490.26 --> 1491.20]  as I take up residence in you,
[1491.20 --> 1493.92]  you will be able to obey
[1493.92 --> 1495.52]  my instruction,
[1496.54 --> 1497.62]  my pattern of life,
[1497.86 --> 1498.68]  my way of being,
[1498.80 --> 1499.62]  the way I left
[1499.62 --> 1501.20]  when I did my earthly ministry.
[1504.64 --> 1505.00]  Secondly,
[1505.46 --> 1506.34]  as I already mentioned,
[1506.70 --> 1507.26]  in verse 7,
[1507.34 --> 1507.72]  Jesus said,
[1507.84 --> 1508.44]  I'll answer prayer.
[1509.18 --> 1510.00]  If you remain in me
[1510.00 --> 1511.10]  and my words remain in you,
[1511.22 --> 1512.62]  ask whatever you wish
[1512.62 --> 1514.12]  and it will be done for you.
[1514.50 --> 1515.48]  And our minds often go
[1515.48 --> 1516.30]  to the first question,
[1516.38 --> 1516.52]  okay,
[1516.60 --> 1517.28]  but I prayed for this
[1517.28 --> 1518.14]  and I didn't get it, right?
[1519.10 --> 1519.42]  But,
[1519.66 --> 1521.60]  how often do we take stock
[1521.60 --> 1522.44]  of the answered prayer?
[1523.36 --> 1524.00]  I mean, really.
[1525.02 --> 1525.70]  I mentioned this
[1525.70 --> 1526.46]  in the 9 a.m. service
[1526.46 --> 1527.24]  when my wife was here,
[1527.36 --> 1528.60]  but Brittany has this practice
[1528.60 --> 1530.38]  in our prayer journaling.
[1530.68 --> 1531.86]  She often has a margin
[1531.86 --> 1532.92]  on the side of her prayer journals
[1532.92 --> 1533.68]  of answered prayer.
[1534.24 --> 1535.14]  And I think that's a good practice
[1535.14 --> 1536.10]  because in our small group
[1536.10 --> 1536.96]  and prayer groups
[1536.96 --> 1537.94]  of our previous church,
[1538.14 --> 1538.90]  we would often have
[1538.90 --> 1539.94]  so many different prayer requests,
[1540.02 --> 1540.82]  but you'd never follow up
[1540.82 --> 1541.00]  and say,
[1541.06 --> 1541.20]  okay,
[1541.30 --> 1542.58]  what happened to that prayer request
[1542.58 --> 1543.16]  from a year ago
[1543.16 --> 1543.84]  or six months ago
[1543.84 --> 1544.50]  or three months ago?
[1544.50 --> 1545.74]  And I was amazed
[1545.74 --> 1546.80]  at seeing Brittany
[1546.80 --> 1547.66]  writing in the prayers
[1547.66 --> 1548.68]  that were answered
[1548.68 --> 1550.26]  in that journal.
[1551.24 --> 1552.44]  And I think we can so often
[1552.44 --> 1553.62]  live in just this present moment
[1553.62 --> 1554.50]  and never even stop to think,
[1554.56 --> 1555.10]  what were we praying
[1555.10 --> 1555.88]  about five years ago?
[1555.94 --> 1556.90]  What has Christ done?
[1557.04 --> 1557.80]  And not believe
[1557.80 --> 1558.96]  that Jesus who loves us,
[1559.00 --> 1559.96]  who invites us into friendship,
[1560.22 --> 1561.98]  who invites us to make requests
[1561.98 --> 1563.44]  will also be the same Jesus
[1563.44 --> 1565.18]  who answers prayer.
[1565.70 --> 1566.36]  If you don't believe me,
[1566.64 --> 1567.32]  try it out.
[1568.20 --> 1569.06]  Test what I'm saying.
[1569.50 --> 1570.76]  Bring it into your own devotional life,
[1570.80 --> 1571.68]  bring it into your small group life
[1571.68 --> 1573.82]  and watch what Christ in his power,
[1574.14 --> 1575.44]  in his love does.
[1578.48 --> 1578.88]  Fourth,
[1579.68 --> 1581.88]  we read from Jesus
[1581.88 --> 1584.00]  that the world will see
[1584.00 --> 1585.50]  that we're Christ's disciples.
[1586.06 --> 1586.36]  In fact,
[1586.44 --> 1587.20]  I'll read what he says
[1587.20 --> 1587.82]  in verse eight.
[1587.92 --> 1588.40]  Jesus says,
[1588.66 --> 1589.80]  this is for the Father's glory
[1589.80 --> 1590.88]  that you will bear fruit,
[1591.22 --> 1592.44]  showing yourselves
[1592.44 --> 1594.30]  to be my disciples.
[1594.40 --> 1595.00]  And what he's after
[1595.00 --> 1595.58]  is that there will be
[1595.58 --> 1596.62]  public evidence
[1596.62 --> 1598.08]  with our neighbors,
[1598.22 --> 1598.62]  our friends,
[1598.72 --> 1599.20]  our coworkers,
[1599.60 --> 1600.26]  those around us,
[1600.26 --> 1601.72]  that we belong to the vine
[1601.72 --> 1602.28]  that is Jesus.
[1603.44 --> 1604.64]  And one of the best questions
[1604.64 --> 1605.52]  you can get from people,
[1605.70 --> 1606.42]  and I know some of you
[1606.42 --> 1606.84]  have gotten this
[1606.84 --> 1607.42]  in your workplace
[1607.42 --> 1608.02]  or your friendship
[1608.02 --> 1608.60]  or at school,
[1608.72 --> 1609.98]  it's like people look at you
[1609.98 --> 1610.90]  and how you're doing in your life,
[1610.96 --> 1611.16]  they're like,
[1611.52 --> 1613.12]  there's just something about you.
[1614.18 --> 1615.96]  You do your work differently
[1615.96 --> 1616.80]  than other people.
[1617.50 --> 1620.20]  You're not after these things
[1620.20 --> 1620.96]  that everyone else is after.
[1621.06 --> 1621.76]  What is that?
[1621.92 --> 1622.32]  And you know,
[1622.40 --> 1624.04]  we're all very polite Canadians,
[1624.22 --> 1624.66]  so we're like,
[1625.14 --> 1625.44]  Jesus.
[1626.08 --> 1627.08]  We say it very quietly,
[1627.60 --> 1627.86]  right?
[1628.54 --> 1629.68]  That's one of the best compliments
[1629.68 --> 1630.22]  you can get where people
[1630.22 --> 1631.02]  see your life
[1631.02 --> 1631.38]  and they know
[1631.38 --> 1632.14]  there's something different
[1632.14 --> 1633.78]  and you know the source of that
[1633.78 --> 1634.98]  is the life of Jesus
[1634.98 --> 1636.90]  bringing fruit in your life.
[1638.28 --> 1638.58]  You know,
[1638.60 --> 1639.10]  a few weeks ago
[1639.10 --> 1639.78]  in our surge group,
[1639.84 --> 1640.48]  we were reading about
[1640.48 --> 1641.82]  these two baseball coaches.
[1642.80 --> 1643.74]  And these baseball coaches
[1643.74 --> 1644.32]  loved the Lord
[1644.32 --> 1645.46]  and they were coaching
[1645.46 --> 1646.80]  a team in a public league
[1646.80 --> 1648.50]  and they just had some plans
[1648.50 --> 1649.28]  on how to sort of push
[1649.28 --> 1649.80]  against some of the
[1649.80 --> 1650.78]  idolatry of sports,
[1650.90 --> 1652.30]  some of the unhealthy competition,
[1652.44 --> 1653.38]  some of the sort of hatred
[1653.38 --> 1654.18]  of the other team
[1654.18 --> 1655.24]  that happens in their sport.
[1655.80 --> 1656.40]  And so these coaches
[1656.40 --> 1657.12]  said with their team,
[1657.22 --> 1657.30]  okay,
[1657.36 --> 1657.94]  here's the things
[1657.94 --> 1658.80]  that we're going to commit to.
[1658.80 --> 1660.60]  We will not trash talk
[1660.60 --> 1661.16]  the other team.
[1661.52 --> 1662.94]  We're going to honor the umpire
[1662.94 --> 1664.04]  even when they make calls
[1664.04 --> 1664.56]  we don't like
[1664.56 --> 1665.44]  and we're going to be
[1665.44 --> 1667.00]  a team that encourages
[1667.00 --> 1667.42]  one another
[1667.42 --> 1668.28]  when there's failure
[1668.28 --> 1669.02]  and frustration
[1669.02 --> 1669.94]  and we're not doing well.
[1670.10 --> 1671.66]  We will not fall into the traps
[1671.66 --> 1672.70]  of the sports world
[1672.70 --> 1673.52]  and you know those exist
[1673.52 --> 1674.08]  in our world,
[1674.42 --> 1675.40]  sports and hockey
[1675.40 --> 1676.10]  and all the rest.
[1676.68 --> 1677.70]  And after a number of months
[1677.70 --> 1678.26]  and even years,
[1678.32 --> 1679.02]  they've been doing this for a while,
[1679.10 --> 1680.78]  they've had so many parents
[1680.78 --> 1682.68]  and umpires
[1682.68 --> 1684.56]  and people from the other team
[1684.56 --> 1685.36]  come up to these coaches
[1685.36 --> 1685.70]  and say,
[1685.82 --> 1686.00]  okay,
[1686.18 --> 1687.34]  like what's going on here?
[1687.34 --> 1690.06]  What is going on with this team?
[1690.10 --> 1690.96]  There's something different
[1690.96 --> 1691.68]  about this team
[1691.68 --> 1692.74]  and of course they'll say,
[1692.84 --> 1692.92]  well,
[1692.98 --> 1693.48]  we're Christians
[1693.48 --> 1695.46]  and this is what we're trying to do.
[1695.64 --> 1697.16]  But even without them saying it,
[1697.20 --> 1698.18]  they were able to bear witness
[1698.18 --> 1698.88]  in a public way
[1698.88 --> 1700.44]  that the life of Jesus Christ,
[1700.86 --> 1702.34]  the fruit of Jesus Christ
[1702.34 --> 1703.16]  is showing up
[1703.16 --> 1704.40]  on the baseball diamond.
[1705.28 --> 1706.42]  There's a public evidence
[1706.42 --> 1707.00]  and Jesus says,
[1707.28 --> 1708.48]  as you remain in me
[1708.48 --> 1709.58]  and I remain in you,
[1709.70 --> 1710.68]  there will be a witness
[1710.68 --> 1712.22]  that you belong to me.
[1712.78 --> 1714.12]  That sort of the vine of Jesus
[1714.12 --> 1714.70]  is planted
[1714.70 --> 1715.74]  and growing in the city
[1715.74 --> 1716.98]  in a whole myriad of ways
[1716.98 --> 1718.40]  through the ordinary lives
[1718.40 --> 1719.00]  of believers
[1719.00 --> 1720.90]  as they abide in Christ.
[1723.30 --> 1724.36]  So to summarize,
[1725.84 --> 1726.66]  Jesus is saying,
[1727.06 --> 1728.28]  abide in me,
[1729.30 --> 1730.48]  dwell in me,
[1731.22 --> 1733.18]  live life in me,
[1733.30 --> 1734.94]  stay closely connected to me
[1734.94 --> 1737.30]  and I will take up residence in you.
[1738.02 --> 1740.26]  I will be in friendship with you.
[1740.34 --> 1741.62]  I will bear fruit in your life
[1741.62 --> 1742.96]  that you can't bear on your own.
[1742.96 --> 1745.22]  I will bring a witness to the city
[1745.22 --> 1746.26]  through you
[1746.26 --> 1747.54]  because of my power
[1747.54 --> 1748.52]  in my life.
[1748.66 --> 1750.04]  Stay grafted in me.
[1750.88 --> 1752.14]  Or to use the image of the vine,
[1752.48 --> 1754.24]  Jesus wants to plant in us
[1754.24 --> 1755.58]  that vine of life
[1755.58 --> 1756.34]  that starts from him
[1756.34 --> 1757.02]  in our city.
[1758.06 --> 1759.18]  And he wants the world
[1759.18 --> 1759.84]  to see the fruit
[1759.84 --> 1761.28]  that comes from following Christ.
[1764.14 --> 1765.10]  And my question
[1765.10 --> 1766.18]  to finish this sermon
[1766.18 --> 1767.50]  is really basic.
[1767.88 --> 1768.98]  I just want to ask,
[1769.02 --> 1770.42]  and I want you to wrestle with this,
[1770.42 --> 1773.34]  do we want
[1773.34 --> 1775.26]  what Jesus is offering here?
[1776.70 --> 1777.74]  Do you want this?
[1778.80 --> 1780.06]  Do we really want to be
[1780.06 --> 1781.70]  in close relationship with Christ?
[1781.76 --> 1782.46]  Do we want to sort of
[1782.46 --> 1784.42]  put ourselves into this
[1784.42 --> 1785.86]  and actually make something of it?
[1785.86 --> 1786.70]  Or do you want to just do
[1786.70 --> 1787.62]  what Adam does, you know,
[1787.66 --> 1788.02]  in the movie?
[1788.18 --> 1789.36]  Just carry around
[1789.36 --> 1790.44]  this distance forever.
[1791.20 --> 1792.38]  Carry around this pain,
[1792.50 --> 1793.08]  this frustration,
[1793.30 --> 1793.92]  this discontent,
[1794.14 --> 1795.90]  this absence for a long time.
[1795.98 --> 1797.08]  Hope, do you want
[1797.08 --> 1798.78]  to be in close relationship
[1798.78 --> 1800.38]  with the very one
[1800.38 --> 1801.06]  who loves you,
[1801.14 --> 1802.16]  and that is Jesus Christ?
[1802.84 --> 1803.52]  Do you want it?
[1804.36 --> 1805.66]  And I'll say very honestly
[1805.66 --> 1806.46]  that I wrestled
[1806.46 --> 1807.22]  with a couple things
[1807.22 --> 1808.20]  in my own conversation
[1808.20 --> 1809.40]  with Christ in this passage.
[1809.50 --> 1810.14]  Some of my own stuff,
[1810.20 --> 1811.74]  but also for us together.
[1811.84 --> 1812.26]  And I want to just
[1812.26 --> 1812.80]  name two of them.
[1812.92 --> 1814.72]  One is the very,
[1815.02 --> 1816.26]  very real challenge
[1816.26 --> 1816.92]  of distraction.
[1818.10 --> 1818.82]  In fact, in my mind
[1818.82 --> 1819.44]  as I was praying,
[1819.80 --> 1821.04]  I just imagined many of us
[1821.04 --> 1821.96]  getting old in this church
[1821.96 --> 1822.90]  and all we have to show
[1822.90 --> 1823.44]  for our age
[1823.44 --> 1825.16]  is thousands of Netflix shows.
[1825.16 --> 1828.68]  10,000 hours of scrolling
[1828.68 --> 1829.44]  through another
[1829.44 --> 1830.26]  social media feed,
[1830.34 --> 1831.44]  another social media platform,
[1831.54 --> 1832.24]  another thing that's
[1832.24 --> 1833.12]  designed to distract,
[1833.36 --> 1834.48]  and we never know
[1834.48 --> 1835.08]  the very heart
[1835.08 --> 1835.84]  of Jesus Christ.
[1836.44 --> 1837.70]  That is a tragedy
[1837.70 --> 1839.38]  if that's the future
[1839.38 --> 1840.00]  of our church.
[1840.96 --> 1841.98]  But I wrestle with that
[1841.98 --> 1842.48]  because I know
[1842.48 --> 1842.96]  that distraction
[1842.96 --> 1843.82]  is not just here
[1843.82 --> 1844.36]  or out there,
[1844.42 --> 1845.26]  it's also in here,
[1845.52 --> 1846.22]  in this pastor.
[1847.10 --> 1848.14]  The second challenge
[1848.14 --> 1848.86]  that I wrestled with
[1848.86 --> 1849.52]  in my own conversation
[1849.52 --> 1849.96]  with Christ
[1849.96 --> 1850.92]  is that of busyness.
[1851.56 --> 1851.70]  You know,
[1851.74 --> 1852.70]  the endless demands,
[1852.84 --> 1853.52]  the endless commitments
[1853.52 --> 1853.92]  we make,
[1853.94 --> 1854.76]  and now that sort of COVID
[1854.76 --> 1855.44]  feels a bit lifted,
[1855.54 --> 1856.08]  we're all back
[1856.08 --> 1857.04]  to the same treadmill
[1857.04 --> 1858.52]  of rat race living
[1858.52 --> 1859.84]  that we were in 2019.
[1860.72 --> 1861.66]  We go from one thing
[1861.66 --> 1862.02]  to the other,
[1862.08 --> 1862.78]  one commitment to the other,
[1862.82 --> 1863.50]  we've got so many
[1863.50 --> 1864.30]  evening things happening,
[1864.48 --> 1865.22]  we're living at a pace
[1865.22 --> 1866.50]  that is unsustainable
[1866.50 --> 1867.78]  for a life of prayer
[1867.78 --> 1868.62]  where we can actually
[1868.62 --> 1869.62]  dive our lives
[1869.62 --> 1870.10]  into the Word
[1870.10 --> 1870.60]  and know
[1870.60 --> 1872.32]  that Christ is speaking to us.
[1873.30 --> 1874.06]  Are we willing
[1874.06 --> 1874.86]  to give up
[1874.86 --> 1875.86]  some commitments
[1875.86 --> 1876.92]  so that we can prioritize
[1876.92 --> 1877.86]  what is at the center,
[1877.96 --> 1878.74]  and that is Jesus
[1878.74 --> 1880.76]  and abiding in Him?
[1880.86 --> 1881.30]  And I don't know
[1881.30 --> 1881.86]  if you know this,
[1881.96 --> 1883.10]  but to have a relationship
[1883.10 --> 1883.78]  with Christ,
[1884.56 --> 1885.12]  as they say
[1885.12 --> 1885.98]  in marriage classes,
[1886.16 --> 1887.68]  it takes T-I-M-E,
[1888.06 --> 1888.84]  it takes time,
[1890.00 --> 1890.88]  and that's just
[1890.88 --> 1891.56]  how it goes.
[1892.78 --> 1893.78]  Distraction and busyness,
[1893.82 --> 1894.90]  and I want to just name also
[1894.90 --> 1896.26]  just our own church culture,
[1896.84 --> 1897.88]  here's something that I love
[1897.88 --> 1898.80]  and is also a challenge
[1898.80 --> 1899.24]  for our church.
[1899.32 --> 1900.28]  Our church likes
[1900.28 --> 1901.20]  to do things,
[1901.86 --> 1902.64]  and I like that.
[1903.22 --> 1904.70]  We love starting ministries,
[1904.80 --> 1905.58]  we love getting involved
[1905.58 --> 1906.32]  in all sorts of stuff,
[1906.40 --> 1907.44]  we love doing walks,
[1907.50 --> 1908.34]  involved in the Cloverdale
[1908.34 --> 1909.00]  Community Kitchen,
[1909.20 --> 1910.30]  lots of good stuff happening,
[1910.30 --> 1911.28]  very active.
[1912.38 --> 1913.04]  But just because
[1913.04 --> 1914.14]  you're an active church
[1914.14 --> 1915.06]  doesn't mean
[1915.06 --> 1916.00]  you're a healthy church,
[1916.86 --> 1917.10]  right?
[1917.60 --> 1918.10]  Just because you've got
[1918.10 --> 1918.64]  lots going on
[1918.64 --> 1919.28]  doesn't mean you've got
[1919.28 --> 1920.40]  a rootedness in the life
[1920.40 --> 1921.28]  of Jesus that is sort of
[1921.28 --> 1922.24]  producing that fruit.
[1922.54 --> 1922.78]  In fact,
[1922.84 --> 1923.72]  we can be very good
[1923.72 --> 1924.44]  at being very busy
[1924.44 --> 1925.50]  and yet running
[1925.50 --> 1926.78]  on a very empty tank.
[1927.94 --> 1928.68]  And there's a story
[1928.68 --> 1929.66]  I heard not that long ago
[1929.66 --> 1930.36]  from a young woman
[1930.36 --> 1930.96]  that I'll share
[1930.96 --> 1931.78]  because I think it's just
[1931.78 --> 1932.58]  a good word for us
[1932.58 --> 1933.40]  to really wrestle with.
[1934.16 --> 1934.76]  There's a young woman
[1934.76 --> 1935.74]  who grew up in the church,
[1936.18 --> 1937.40]  very committed to Christ,
[1937.54 --> 1937.98]  very committed,
[1938.06 --> 1939.08]  she just loved this church,
[1939.08 --> 1939.80]  and she was involved
[1939.80 --> 1940.70]  with children's ministry
[1940.70 --> 1941.56]  and youth ministry
[1941.56 --> 1943.06]  and then she got very involved
[1943.06 --> 1944.12]  in worship ministry.
[1944.96 --> 1945.78]  And she was sort of
[1945.78 --> 1946.66]  at work behind the scenes
[1946.66 --> 1947.28]  making sure everything
[1947.28 --> 1948.58]  that happens on a Sunday morning
[1948.58 --> 1949.28]  is going to work
[1949.28 --> 1950.14]  and everything's put together
[1950.14 --> 1951.32]  and she's just always busy.
[1951.50 --> 1952.76]  And then there's a season
[1952.76 --> 1954.00]  that was a number
[1954.00 --> 1954.60]  of years ago now
[1954.60 --> 1955.56]  where there's just tension
[1955.56 --> 1956.68]  in the worship ministry
[1956.68 --> 1957.56]  for a vision of it
[1957.56 --> 1958.36]  or how it's going to go
[1958.36 --> 1959.64]  and there's some opposing
[1959.64 --> 1961.04]  personalities and conflict.
[1961.20 --> 1962.18]  It never happens in our church,
[1962.26 --> 1962.88]  but other churches.
[1965.20 --> 1966.08]  We have great,
[1966.24 --> 1966.84]  just for the record,
[1966.90 --> 1968.02]  we have a great worship ministry.
[1968.02 --> 1969.82]  And then she was just seeing
[1969.82 --> 1970.66]  all this conflict.
[1970.82 --> 1971.60]  She was seeing some of the tension.
[1971.70 --> 1972.66]  She was carrying so much
[1972.66 --> 1973.36]  and finally she said,
[1973.48 --> 1973.88]  I quit.
[1974.56 --> 1975.08]  I quit.
[1976.06 --> 1976.46]  And she said,
[1976.50 --> 1977.44]  there's so much happening,
[1977.54 --> 1978.36]  so much busyness,
[1978.38 --> 1978.94]  so much activity,
[1978.94 --> 1979.94]  but she could not find
[1979.94 --> 1981.48]  the very heart of Jesus Christ
[1981.48 --> 1982.22]  in it.
[1982.82 --> 1983.94]  And she has some deep reflection
[1983.94 --> 1985.28]  she shared with some of us
[1985.28 --> 1986.18]  about how a church
[1986.18 --> 1987.08]  can be so busy
[1987.08 --> 1988.08]  and look so good
[1988.08 --> 1989.30]  and yet it's so absent
[1989.30 --> 1990.26]  from that rootedness
[1990.26 --> 1991.70]  and the life of abiding
[1991.70 --> 1992.86]  in Christ.
[1992.86 --> 1994.72]  And so I think
[1994.72 --> 1995.66]  that's a word for us
[1995.66 --> 1998.02]  that lean towards
[1998.02 --> 1999.04]  being an active church,
[1999.54 --> 2000.50]  that let our activity
[2000.50 --> 2001.90]  be grounded in abiding.
[2003.52 --> 2005.42]  Let our work in the city
[2005.42 --> 2006.86]  be grounded in a confidence
[2006.86 --> 2008.00]  and a knowing
[2008.00 --> 2009.50]  of the heart of Jesus Christ.
[2010.38 --> 2011.60]  Let us be listeners
[2011.60 --> 2013.62]  who then are laborers,
[2014.36 --> 2015.72]  friends who then seek
[2015.72 --> 2016.44]  to bear witness
[2016.44 --> 2017.82]  in our ordinary work lives.
[2019.82 --> 2021.84]  Hope Christ says to us
[2021.84 --> 2022.44]  this morning,
[2023.58 --> 2024.62]  remain in me.
[2025.68 --> 2027.00]  Stay connected to me.
[2027.72 --> 2028.60]  Abide in me
[2028.60 --> 2030.28]  and I will remain in you.
[2030.40 --> 2032.32]  I will dwell in you.
[2032.72 --> 2033.12]  And Christ,
[2033.38 --> 2034.42]  He will bear fruit
[2034.42 --> 2035.24]  in our lives
[2035.24 --> 2036.32]  that we cannot,
[2036.78 --> 2038.86]  we cannot do on our own.
[2038.92 --> 2040.16]  We cannot bear on our own.
[2040.74 --> 2042.00]  He's offering so much
[2042.00 --> 2042.48]  and I want us,
[2042.58 --> 2042.70]  you know,
[2042.96 --> 2043.66]  this morning I just wanted
[2043.66 --> 2044.76]  to take hold of this
[2044.76 --> 2045.40]  by faith
[2045.40 --> 2046.62]  and really test out
[2046.62 --> 2047.54]  everything Jesus is saying
[2047.54 --> 2048.22]  because my hope
[2048.22 --> 2048.62]  for our church,
[2048.70 --> 2049.58]  my prayer for our church
[2049.58 --> 2050.86]  is so much fruit
[2050.86 --> 2051.40]  will be born.
[2051.84 --> 2053.44]  as we remain
[2053.44 --> 2054.10]  in the life
[2054.10 --> 2055.18]  and the love of Jesus
[2055.18 --> 2056.84]  who calls us
[2056.84 --> 2058.10]  His friends.
[2059.44 --> 2060.18]  Let's pray.
[2068.66 --> 2069.16]  Father,
[2069.24 --> 2069.72]  we thank You
[2069.72 --> 2070.38]  for this Word
[2070.38 --> 2073.34]  and we pray
[2073.34 --> 2073.92]  that You would do
[2073.92 --> 2074.94]  Your work in us.
[2076.68 --> 2077.84]  Whether shame
[2077.84 --> 2079.30]  over weak devotional lives
[2079.30 --> 2080.08]  or that guilt
[2080.08 --> 2080.70]  we're carrying
[2080.70 --> 2081.50]  over the distance,
[2081.66 --> 2082.20]  we pray, Lord,
[2082.24 --> 2082.86]  that Your Spirit
[2082.86 --> 2084.02]  would minister to us.
[2085.98 --> 2087.48]  Would You strengthen us
[2087.48 --> 2089.18]  to abide in You,
[2089.98 --> 2091.88]  to remain in You,
[2091.94 --> 2092.66]  even in seasons
[2092.66 --> 2093.68]  where we feel distant,
[2094.48 --> 2095.46]  seasons where we struggle.
[2096.56 --> 2097.80]  And we just ask, Lord,
[2097.86 --> 2099.52]  that You would come close to us,
[2100.08 --> 2103.16]  that You would bear fruit in us,
[2103.16 --> 2105.00]  and that our city
[2105.00 --> 2105.48]  would see
[2105.48 --> 2106.28]  that we are connected
[2106.28 --> 2107.14]  to the source
[2107.14 --> 2108.28]  of eternal life,
[2109.40 --> 2109.68]  Jesus.
[2111.66 --> 2112.02]  Amen.
[2112.02 --> 2113.02]  Amen.
