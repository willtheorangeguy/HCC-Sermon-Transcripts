[0.00 → 6.92] Good morning, Hope.
[9.60 → 12.32] It is my privilege to bring you God's Word this morning.
[12.56 → 18.96] But before we get into God's Word, I know Pastor Misha has already explained and expressed
[18.96 → 21.56] how grateful she is for all the volunteers.
[21.88 → 25.30] With that being said, I know a lot of the volunteers, I don't see them right now.
[25.30 → 27.94] I think a lot of them have gone to help out.
[27.94 → 33.54] But if I could have all the volunteers stand right now from summer camp.
[33.54 → 38.74] All the leaders, I should be clear, all the leaders with the orange or purple shirts and
[38.74 → 40.86] all the volunteers that helped out as well.
[40.86 → 45.48] If you could just stand up for a quick second so we can actually appreciate the faces of
[45.48 → 49.42] those who helped out, including the coordinators, please.
[49.92 → 55.08] So if we can give one more round of applause for our leaders for the summer camp.
[56.76 → 57.92] Thank you so much.
[57.94 → 58.44] Thank you.
[58.44 → 58.94] Thank you.
[58.94 → 59.94] Thank you.
[59.94 → 61.54] Also, I want to give a special thanks.
[61.54 → 63.54] I can't see Esther right now.
[63.54 → 65.54] You can have a seat.
[65.54 → 66.54] I don't see Esther here.
[66.54 → 67.54] I think she's at Cornerstone.
[67.54 → 72.88] But Esther, Misha, and Casey, as the coordinators for the summer camp, I want to give a special
[72.88 → 78.54] thanks and all the work that they have put in to organizing and making this camp happen.
[78.54 → 84.14] And we can't express enough how much of a blessing it is for the community.
[84.14 → 87.74] And I know you know, but a lot of the kids that come to the summer camp are not necessarily
[87.74 → 90.74] kids from our church or from churches either.
[90.74 → 96.64] And so we're very thankful that we have had the opportunity again this summer to be a blessing
[96.64 → 98.14] for the community.
[98.14 → 101.74] So thank you again to the volunteers and the leaders.
[101.74 → 102.74] Thank you.
[102.74 → 104.74] Thank you.
[104.74 → 105.74] Thank you.
[105.74 → 116.18] And this feeling of gratitude is a perfect segue into our psalm this morning, Psalm 100
[116.18 → 117.74] that we will look at.
[117.74 → 120.44] And again, one more.
[120.44 → 125.56] I would like to try one more thing so that we can keep ourselves in it.
[125.56 → 130.92] If I could ask one more time to turn to the person next to you or those around you to greet
[130.92 → 136.96] them just one more time and say, out of gratitude, we have joy.
[136.96 → 142.60] So greet one another one more time saying, out of gratitude, we have joy.
[142.60 → 148.12] And please try to at least be joyful or pretend to be joyful when you say this.
[148.12 → 151.44] Out of gratitude, we have joy.
[151.44 → 152.44] We have joy.
[152.44 → 160.32] And so this morning, I am very thankful myself.
[160.32 → 168.20] I am grateful that I get to preach on Psalm 100, which is relatively a more light or a
[168.20 → 174.08] more joyful psalm, especially when compared to Dave's sermon last week, where the psalm
[174.08 → 179.72] was a little bit more sobering, and it challenged us to be truthful in our lives with our sins
[179.72 → 181.08] and our brokenness.
[181.08 → 187.58] But this morning with Psalm 100, we look at how this psalm, as well as all the other
[187.58 → 191.68] psalms, reflect honest prayers to our God.
[191.68 → 197.14] Our Psalm 100 this morning reminds us of the reason that we are able to even give thanks
[197.14 → 198.14] to God.
[198.14 → 204.96] It's why we give thanks and why we are joyful, even in the midst of difficult times
[204.96 → 208.46] or even in times of brokenness and shame.
[208.46 → 213.14] So this morning, I hope you don't hear that I'm trying to get everyone to pretend that they
[213.14 → 219.20] are joyful, even though their lives or your lives might not be so joyful right now.
[219.20 → 224.46] It is not my intention to take this psalm and to force you somehow to pretend to be joyful.
[224.46 → 229.84] But one of the honest prayers, one of the honest feelings or one of the honest emotions that
[229.84 → 233.10] we have to our God includes joy.
[233.52 → 235.36] It definitely includes joy.
[235.36 → 241.46] And so if you take away anything from our psalm this morning, I hope it is this.
[241.54 → 242.94] It is the greeting that we had.
[243.80 → 245.84] We have joy out of gratitude.
[246.40 → 248.88] Out of gratitude, we have joy.
[249.12 → 251.54] It is not a blind joy.
[252.04 → 255.88] Just some sort of happiness that has no reason.
[255.88 → 257.42] We are happy.
[257.60 → 258.46] We are joyful.
[258.84 → 265.38] And we get to even shout for joy only because we are thankful for what God has done for us.
[266.12 → 272.14] And so this psalm invites us to shout because of the ultimate hope we have in God.
[272.84 → 274.12] Joy out of gratitude.
[274.86 → 276.24] Out of gratitude, we have joy.
[276.52 → 281.00] And so out of curiosity, when was the last time you actually shouted?
[282.14 → 285.86] Except for the time when we were cheering for our kids here, when they were singing,
[285.86 → 288.96] their songs with the limited sound system that we had.
[289.60 → 293.12] But the song is one of my most favourite songs.
[293.26 → 298.26] And the lyrics for the chorus is just perfect for this psalm, for this sermon this morning.
[298.80 → 300.78] There is joy in the house of the Lord.
[301.10 → 303.08] There is joy in the house of the Lord today.
[303.50 → 304.42] And we won't be?
[305.26 → 305.58] Yeah.
[306.10 → 307.38] You are not supposed to be quiet.
[308.20 → 308.58] Why?
[308.90 → 311.32] Because we are shouting for joy to God.
[311.32 → 317.72] It is not some earthly thing that we are just quickly joyful of and are done with.
[318.30 → 323.20] We are joyful in our ultimate hope in what God has done.
[323.46 → 324.86] In our gratitude to God.
[325.96 → 332.08] And so as I was preparing for this sermon, the imagery that came to me, and I can't pretend that this was mine.
[332.08 → 333.86] It actually came from my wife, Moon.
[334.86 → 342.30] It was in how we as humans, and I say we all humans, created in God's image, seem to be the least hesitant.
[342.90 → 349.46] To shout, to really shout and cheer for joy when encouraging for those in need.
[349.46 → 355.42] And so, I don't know if you are aware, but most professional sports teams do this.
[355.92 → 361.34] But when someone fighting a very serious condition is presented in a game, some sort of ceremony,
[361.90 → 364.96] people do not hold back their encouraging shouts.
[365.82 → 373.76] And I suggest that they shout because they desire deep in their hearts for redemption, for healing.
[373.76 → 382.36] And in many games, they shout, the crowd shouts almost as loud as when they see a fight break out in a hockey game.
[383.76 → 390.30] And so if you have your Bibles with you, or your phones, or your apps, please turn with me to our joyful psalm.
[390.62 → 391.44] Psalm 100.
[392.00 → 393.20] And we will read from the top.
[397.46 → 398.46] Psalm 100.
[398.70 → 401.74] A psalm for giving grateful praise.
[401.74 → 405.26] And so we hear this psalm this morning, Hope.
[405.76 → 409.20] Shout for the joy to the Lord, all the earth.
[409.90 → 410.72] Shout for joy.
[411.56 → 413.36] Worship the Lord with gladness.
[413.84 → 416.26] Come before Him with joyful songs.
[416.76 → 419.72] Know that the Lord is God.
[420.52 → 422.70] It is He who made us, and we are His.
[423.18 → 426.16] We are His people, the sheep of His pasture.
[426.80 → 431.46] Enter His gates with Thanksgiving, and His courts with praise.
[431.74 → 435.50] Give thanks to Him and praise His name.
[436.68 → 440.08] For the Lord is good, and His love endures forever.
[440.26 → 442.00] I feel like we should say this all together.
[442.34 → 442.90] Verse 5.
[443.14 → 444.80] If we can read it together, please.
[445.62 → 449.74] For the Lord is good, and His love endures forever.
[450.32 → 454.18] His faithfulness continues through all generations.
[454.98 → 455.20] Amen.
[455.96 → 456.24] Amen.
[459.32 → 462.06] This very long psalm that we have this morning.
[462.74 → 465.08] The makeup of this psalm is very interesting,
[465.68 → 470.38] and reflects a central message of what I suggest, joy out of gratitude.
[470.38 → 476.90] There are only five verses, and I suggest, upon reading and studying this psalm,
[477.44 → 481.56] I suggest that verses 1, 3, and 5, so the odd number verses,
[482.14 → 485.74] reflect the gospel of God's redemptive kingdom.
[486.54 → 487.70] 1, 3, and 5.
[487.70 → 494.26] And so the other two verses, verses 2 and 4, reflect the calling for us as God's people,
[494.68 → 496.48] living in this redemptive narrative.
[497.12 → 501.64] Our calling to gather together, to live in God's kingdom.
[502.40 → 504.24] As Pastor Sid reflected this morning,
[504.58 → 508.78] I promise you I did not share anything about my sermon this morning with Pastor Sid,
[508.78 → 515.50] but it's amazing how the call to worship that Pastor Sid shared with us this morning
[515.50 → 521.28] just reflects perfectly our calling as God's people, to gather together.
[522.28 → 524.42] I will get more into this as we go along.
[524.72 → 527.96] But the first verse, the first verse says,
[528.78 → 530.56] Shout for joy to the Lord.
[531.24 → 532.22] Shout for joy.
[533.06 → 537.90] Now, this shouting for joy is directed to capital L-O-R-D.
[537.90 → 543.34] Now, if you're not aware of why the Bible sometimes spells just L-O-R-D,
[543.74 → 547.26] or even sometimes capital L, but not capital.
[547.74 → 548.48] What's not capital?
[550.32 → 551.26] Lowercase, sorry.
[551.62 → 554.52] Lowercase, so capital L, lowercase O-R-D.
[555.18 → 558.32] Or sometimes the Bible spells L-O-R-D, all capitals.
[558.86 → 563.42] The all caps L-O-R-D signify the personal name of Yahweh.
[564.04 → 566.36] We just don't say or spell it Yahweh,
[566.36 → 567.66] because we don't know.
[567.90 → 570.56] Many people may not be familiar with it.
[571.26 → 574.96] And so in the Hebrew, we just say Adonai, which just means Lord.
[575.58 → 580.56] But our translators do want to signify that this is a prayer.
[580.90 → 581.82] This is a psalm.
[582.00 → 585.54] This is a shout for joy to the capital L-O-R-D,
[585.86 → 589.34] our personal God, Yahweh, the God of Israel.
[589.34 → 594.66] And this is not a shout to some random deity, some random godly figure.
[595.48 → 601.20] This is very important that we do acknowledge that we are shouting to our God.
[601.20 → 610.68] In one of our sermons on the Psalms, Pastor Dave emphasized the importance of referring to God as the God of Israel,
[610.94 → 616.38] not just some god, G-O-D, but Yahweh, the God of Israel.
[616.38 → 623.92] It reminds the readers of the Psalms that it was their God who saved them from slavery in Egypt.
[624.40 → 628.06] It was their God that provided salvation for them.
[628.06 → 635.08] We take that, and we know that this is reflective, this is symbolic of Christ's work on the cross.
[635.48 → 640.66] And we are reminded of the saving work of God in Christ his Son.
[640.66 → 644.86] And so this verse points us to the central message again,
[645.04 → 653.22] that we can find joy because we are grateful of God's ultimate work of redemption for us,
[653.58 → 657.64] and more importantly, all creation through Christ.
[659.34 → 666.32] And so I suggest we cannot miss how this psalm, Psalm 100, that's thousands of years old,
[667.50 → 669.44] reflect Revelation 21.
[669.44 → 673.38] That image of the fulfillment of God's kingdom,
[673.68 → 678.48] where we have no more tears, we have no more pain, we have no more suffering,
[678.78 → 681.02] we have the fulfillment of God's kingdom,
[681.28 → 684.20] and it is reflected in our psalm this morning as well.
[685.82 → 690.34] This redemptive kingdom includes all creation.
[691.10 → 693.74] Hence, our psalm's invitation in verse 1,
[694.22 → 695.64] and yes, we are still in verse 1,
[695.64 → 697.88] Shout for joy to the Lord,
[698.74 → 699.74] all the earth.
[700.58 → 706.28] All creation is invited, is called to worship the creator of heaven and earth.
[706.28 → 713.04] And so being grounded in this gospel narrative,
[713.76 → 715.74] that we reflect Revelation 21,
[715.74 → 717.68] the beginning of creation to the end,
[717.78 → 723.52] where God fulfills and God redeems his creation, including us.
[723.52 → 730.24] We cannot but help but be thankful for what God has done.
[730.90 → 732.92] And so in light of this gospel message,
[733.40 → 740.56] verse 2 invites us to worship and come before the Lord with gladness and joyful songs.
[740.56 → 745.68] We, as God's people, are called to worship.
[746.40 → 750.88] Verse 2, actually, the Hebrew word where it's translated as,
[751.48 → 753.02] worship the Lord with gladness.
[753.84 → 759.66] Worship the Lord with gladness also includes the nuance of serving.
[760.68 → 763.64] And so the English word we have for the Hebrew, avid,
[764.44 → 768.56] the closest thing that captures most of its meaning is worship the Lord,
[768.56 → 769.30] which is correct.
[769.30 → 777.30] But in that definition also includes serve the Lord and come before him with gladness.
[777.90 → 778.98] Serve the Lord.
[780.26 → 781.38] September is coming.
[782.92 → 789.98] Our calling as God's people is to serve the Lord and, secondly, be in his presence.
[790.62 → 792.34] Because in verse 2 it says,
[793.04 → 798.08] Worship, serve the Lord, but also come before him with gladness.
[798.56 → 803.94] And the come before him, again, I'm sorry if I'm sounding like a Hebrew geek this morning.
[804.48 → 806.90] I'm not a huge expert in Hebrew.
[807.32 → 811.76] But it is important to note that come before the Lord, come before him,
[812.38 → 817.22] literally means be in God's face, in front of God's face.
[818.52 → 822.66] The Hebrew actually has face in this expression.
[822.66 → 826.98] Be in front of God's face.
[826.98 → 829.22] Come before him.
[834.42 → 836.98] In other words, losing my place here.
[837.14 → 840.12] In other words, from the gratitude that we have in the gospel,
[840.78 → 844.10] in the good news of God's redemptive kingdom, comes joy.
[844.32 → 845.58] So we shout for joy.
[845.58 → 848.34] We come with gladness and joyful songs.
[848.86 → 852.56] And this bears fruit in our calling as God's people,
[852.70 → 857.78] which is serving, worshipping God, and being in his presence.
[858.42 → 860.76] This is your calling this morning, Hope.
[862.16 → 865.72] And so according to my suggestion then, we're moving on to verse 3.
[866.70 → 869.80] The odd number of verses has to reflect this redemptive gospel.
[869.80 → 875.16] Verse 3 then, according to my theory, has to reflect it as well.
[876.20 → 882.48] Evidently, verse 3 invites us to reflect on who Yahweh, our Lord, is.
[883.74 → 887.32] To be precise, because sometimes I mix this up.
[887.78 → 888.94] I misread this, I mean.
[889.70 → 894.32] This verse 3 says, the Lord is God.
[895.18 → 898.06] And sometimes I mistakenly read it as, the Lord is good,
[898.06 → 899.44] which is very common.
[899.70 → 901.14] We hear it all the time in the Bible.
[901.38 → 902.48] The Lord is good.
[904.10 → 906.08] But here it is very explicit.
[907.36 → 910.66] Know that the Lord is God.
[911.76 → 916.92] Our Lord Yahweh, capital L-O-R-D, is God.
[917.84 → 920.22] It is He who created us.
[920.22 → 922.98] It is He who created the whole world.
[923.62 → 925.08] And He is God.
[925.08 → 932.90] It is also He who made us and have called us to be His people.
[933.72 → 935.52] And so in verse 3, it says,
[936.56 → 938.58] It is He who made us, and we are His.
[938.82 → 940.38] We are His people.
[941.22 → 943.08] The sheep of His pasture.
[945.46 → 947.36] The sheep of His pasture.
[947.36 → 952.24] How can we not read this in light of Christ?
[952.84 → 954.40] In light of the gospel narrative?
[956.56 → 960.34] It hasn't been far since we finished our John series.
[961.40 → 963.30] And when we were in the Gospel of John,
[963.96 → 965.86] one of the best gospels,
[966.54 → 967.84] Jesus said in John 10,
[968.42 → 971.02] I am the good shepherd.
[971.02 → 973.90] I am the good shepherd.
[973.90 → 978.28] The good shepherd lays down His life for His sheep.
[978.70 → 980.54] Which is exactly what Jesus did.
[981.10 → 986.00] Which is exactly what our God in Psalm 100 is described as.
[987.80 → 992.14] Jesus is the one who laid down His life for the sake of our own sins.
[992.56 → 996.20] He took on the brokenness and the sinfulness of the world,
[996.62 → 999.04] even though He Himself was sinless.
[999.04 → 1003.10] Hence, I feel like I've proven my point.
[1003.48 → 1008.72] Verse 3 also reflects the gospel narrative of God's redemptive kingdom.
[1010.60 → 1014.60] And so on the backdrop of this gospel narrative,
[1015.28 → 1019.64] verse 4 now invites God's people to their calling once again.
[1020.88 → 1022.36] We read verse 4 again.
[1022.92 → 1025.04] Enter His gates with Thanksgiving,
[1025.36 → 1026.98] and His courts with praise.
[1026.98 → 1030.40] Give thanks to Him and praise His name.
[1036.66 → 1039.68] This verse again reflects our calling.
[1040.16 → 1042.32] On the backdrop again of verse 3,
[1042.54 → 1045.42] as the gospel narrative of God's redemptive kingdom,
[1045.74 → 1047.92] verse 4 calls us again.
[1049.20 → 1050.86] Serve, worship the Lord,
[1051.34 → 1054.02] and be in His presence.
[1054.02 → 1055.34] Those two things.
[1056.34 → 1058.18] Worship and serve the Lord,
[1058.66 → 1060.32] and be in His presence.
[1060.54 → 1062.48] Sometimes we do one or the other.
[1064.00 → 1065.52] I grew up in the Korean church,
[1065.98 → 1067.38] as I've said multiple times,
[1067.80 → 1072.88] and I feel like one of the habits that we need to break as a Korean church
[1072.88 → 1075.28] is to emphasize a little bit less,
[1075.36 → 1076.46] and find a good balance,
[1076.70 → 1078.30] of serving the Lord,
[1078.38 → 1079.80] but also being in His presence.
[1079.80 → 1082.18] There's a lot of serving,
[1082.84 → 1083.68] lots of serving,
[1083.88 → 1086.62] as we have seen with our volunteers at summer camp.
[1087.16 → 1088.00] Lots of serving,
[1088.32 → 1089.80] lots of good work for the Lord.
[1090.90 → 1092.34] But we must not forget
[1092.34 → 1093.52] that we,
[1093.80 → 1095.40] as created in God's image,
[1095.44 → 1096.46] as human beings,
[1096.92 → 1099.24] we need to be in God's presence.
[1099.54 → 1101.80] We need to stand before God's face,
[1101.94 → 1103.48] which is a very scary thing,
[1103.54 → 1103.94] by the way.
[1103.94 → 1108.48] To be in the presence of the most holy God.
[1110.06 → 1111.30] But this, again,
[1111.46 → 1114.88] reflects the image of how we are a broken bowl,
[1115.46 → 1117.62] mended together by the grace of God,
[1117.76 → 1120.56] where God's presence is poured into our lives,
[1121.20 → 1123.88] and it's not just taking a little bit of God's presence,
[1124.18 → 1127.68] and then going and sprinkling as much as we can to bless others.
[1128.14 → 1131.52] That image is always bearing as much as we can,
[1131.94 → 1133.70] much more than we can bear.
[1133.94 → 1135.80] Much more than we can prepare for.
[1136.60 → 1137.08] And so,
[1137.38 → 1140.06] when God's blessing overflows,
[1140.52 → 1143.00] that's when we become a true blessing for others.
[1144.36 → 1145.52] And that reflects
[1145.52 → 1148.44] in how we cannot say,
[1149.00 → 1151.36] oh, it's me who's doing all the sprinkling,
[1151.44 → 1152.02] all the blessing.
[1152.30 → 1153.42] It's my work.
[1154.10 → 1156.14] It's my serving the Lord.
[1157.14 → 1161.20] But when we have that image of God blessing us and overflowing,
[1161.20 → 1165.10] it's not me necessarily blessing others.
[1165.10 → 1167.76] It's God blessing others through me.
[1168.26 → 1170.42] How can I take any credit for this?
[1170.42 → 1175.70] And so,
[1176.08 → 1178.02] coming back to our psalm this morning,
[1178.90 → 1181.62] just in case this short five-verse psalm
[1181.62 → 1184.74] has not emphasized the gospel narrative enough,
[1185.34 → 1187.56] verse five also concludes the psalm
[1187.56 → 1189.70] by describing God's character.
[1189.70 → 1192.14] Yahweh,
[1192.14 → 1192.22] Yahweh,
[1192.56 → 1193.30] our God,
[1193.48 → 1194.90] is described as good
[1194.90 → 1197.40] and that His love endures forever,
[1197.74 → 1198.86] as we sang this morning.
[1200.36 → 1202.76] Just as Christ laid down His life down
[1202.76 → 1204.38] for the love of others,
[1204.48 → 1206.20] for the love of His sheep,
[1206.90 → 1208.32] so is our God
[1208.32 → 1210.82] described in the exact same way.
[1210.82 → 1214.28] His faithfulness,
[1214.38 → 1215.38] God's faithfulness.
[1216.26 → 1217.28] And we must be clear,
[1217.68 → 1219.56] it is His faithfulness,
[1219.72 → 1220.58] not our own.
[1222.14 → 1224.42] And even when we may fail and falter,
[1224.54 → 1226.34] and we do fail and falter,
[1227.38 → 1229.10] God remains faithful
[1229.10 → 1230.94] and His love for us
[1230.94 → 1233.72] endures through all generations.
[1234.70 → 1235.82] All generations.
[1235.82 → 1239.46] God's work of redemption
[1239.46 → 1240.98] is His mission,
[1241.18 → 1241.92] as I have expressed,
[1242.30 → 1243.00] not ours.
[1243.22 → 1245.56] We have assurance in Christ,
[1246.00 → 1247.06] not in ourselves.
[1247.54 → 1249.16] Our calling is to live
[1249.16 → 1250.62] into this assurance,
[1250.80 → 1252.30] to overflow because
[1252.30 → 1253.66] we have assurance
[1253.66 → 1255.18] in the good news of Christ.
[1256.42 → 1257.54] And how do we do this?
[1257.70 → 1259.06] How do we let this overflow?
[1259.98 → 1261.22] It is by obeying,
[1261.74 → 1263.98] being obedient to God's calling
[1263.98 → 1267.06] to serve and be in His presence.
[1269.94 → 1271.18] So here you're calling
[1271.18 → 1272.12] this morning, church.
[1273.22 → 1274.30] Serve the Lord
[1274.30 → 1275.78] and be in His presence.
[1277.60 → 1280.44] And as I sort of expressed
[1280.44 → 1283.30] at the beginning of the sermon,
[1284.38 → 1285.78] our calling to serve
[1285.78 → 1287.10] and be in God's presence
[1287.10 → 1288.32] out of joy
[1288.32 → 1290.30] because we are so thankful
[1290.30 → 1291.36] for what God has done
[1291.36 → 1292.58] and what He is doing
[1292.58 → 1293.94] for the ultimate hope
[1293.94 → 1294.78] of all creation.
[1296.22 → 1296.96] This joy,
[1298.02 → 1299.28] this calling to joy,
[1300.22 → 1301.76] is not a blind joy
[1301.76 → 1302.96] that disregards
[1302.96 → 1304.00] all that we go through
[1304.00 → 1305.24] in our journeys of faith.
[1306.26 → 1307.54] There is a reason
[1307.54 → 1309.92] why this is just one psalm,
[1310.18 → 1311.34] one short psalm,
[1311.38 → 1311.94] I might add,
[1312.08 → 1313.72] out of 150 psalms
[1313.72 → 1314.22] that we have.
[1315.78 → 1317.38] The encouragement today
[1317.38 → 1318.78] is to be reminded
[1318.78 → 1320.16] of the gospel of Christ
[1320.16 → 1321.92] and the ultimate joy
[1321.92 → 1322.58] and hope
[1322.58 → 1323.70] that we have in Him.
[1325.34 → 1326.36] The psalm isn't meant
[1326.36 → 1329.18] to get you out of
[1329.18 → 1330.20] whatever life's phase
[1330.20 → 1330.80] you are in,
[1331.30 → 1333.36] in somehow trying to force you
[1333.36 → 1334.14] to be joyful
[1334.14 → 1335.14] because you're a Christian.
[1336.82 → 1338.52] We must be joyful, yes.
[1338.74 → 1339.58] It is our calling
[1339.58 → 1340.74] to joyfully serve
[1340.74 → 1342.02] and be in God's presence
[1342.02 → 1342.92] because we know
[1342.92 → 1344.22] and we have hope
[1344.22 → 1346.28] in God's ultimate plan
[1346.28 → 1347.34] of redemption, yes.
[1347.34 → 1349.66] but at the same time
[1349.66 → 1350.52] we are broken,
[1350.74 → 1351.38] sinful people.
[1353.62 → 1355.24] And it is not necessarily,
[1355.94 → 1358.18] I might seem very joyful
[1358.18 → 1358.70] this morning
[1358.70 → 1359.66] because I get to preach
[1359.66 → 1360.38] on Psalm 100,
[1361.04 → 1363.00] but that doesn't necessarily mean
[1363.00 → 1364.20] that I woke up
[1364.20 → 1365.32] all joyful
[1365.32 → 1367.16] with all the lack of sleep
[1367.16 → 1367.98] that I had
[1367.98 → 1368.66] because of Timothy.
[1370.20 → 1371.10] Moon's going to laugh
[1371.10 → 1371.56] in my face.
[1371.82 → 1373.32] You didn't get enough sleep?
[1373.32 → 1377.50] But it's not necessarily
[1377.50 → 1380.38] pretending to be joyful
[1380.38 → 1383.58] and commanding all Christians
[1383.58 → 1384.86] to be always joyful
[1384.86 → 1385.72] because, hey,
[1386.34 → 1387.74] you have assurance in Christ.
[1387.86 → 1388.76] Why are you so down?
[1389.28 → 1390.46] Why are you so down
[1390.46 → 1390.84] all the time?
[1390.88 → 1391.70] Why are you so sad?
[1391.94 → 1392.96] Why are you lamenting?
[1394.26 → 1395.26] Why are you always
[1395.26 → 1396.22] confessing your sins?
[1396.34 → 1396.96] Forget about it.
[1396.98 → 1397.74] Just be joyful.
[1398.08 → 1399.48] We have assurance in Christ.
[1399.48 → 1402.96] That's not what this Psalm,
[1403.20 → 1405.52] that's not what the Gospel narrative
[1405.52 → 1408.30] is trying to pull us towards
[1408.30 → 1409.74] or force us towards.
[1410.88 → 1412.94] We are meant to be
[1412.94 → 1414.24] fully human beings,
[1414.58 → 1416.72] which means that we have
[1416.72 → 1418.88] full range of emotions.
[1421.22 → 1422.66] The important thing
[1422.66 → 1425.10] is to bring all of that
[1425.10 → 1427.34] to our personal God,
[1427.50 → 1427.86] Yahweh,
[1428.36 → 1429.34] to our God.
[1429.48 → 1431.74] who loves us
[1431.74 → 1434.36] and who is good to us
[1434.36 → 1436.54] and His love and goodness
[1436.54 → 1437.40] endures forever.
[1438.68 → 1438.98] Amen?
[1440.72 → 1441.24] Amen.
[1441.52 → 1441.94] Thank you.
[1443.32 → 1445.02] That's why one of the ways
[1445.02 → 1446.20] we get to worship,
[1446.68 → 1447.00] serve,
[1447.12 → 1448.12] and be in God's presence
[1448.12 → 1450.10] is to join together
[1450.10 → 1451.72] for worship like this,
[1452.08 → 1453.66] but also in a night
[1453.66 → 1454.56] where we get to be
[1454.56 → 1455.34] a little more intimate
[1455.34 → 1457.16] and share in a lot of worship
[1457.16 → 1458.32] and prayer like dwell.
[1458.32 → 1460.58] August 25th,
[1461.36 → 1462.36] 7.30 p.m.
[1462.36 → 1463.46] in the fireside room
[1463.46 → 1465.08] where our young adults
[1465.08 → 1466.30] are excited to be leading
[1466.30 → 1467.60] our worship for this.
[1467.60 → 1474.74] The encouragement today, Hope,
[1474.98 → 1477.34] is to find peace,
[1478.30 → 1479.78] find shalom,
[1480.34 → 1481.84] which reflects God's redemption,
[1481.98 → 1482.36] by the way.
[1482.86 → 1484.80] Find comfort in God's work
[1484.80 → 1486.04] of ultimate redemption
[1486.04 → 1487.66] for us and all creation,
[1487.66 → 1488.90] and hopefully,
[1489.22 → 1490.24] out of this assurance,
[1490.46 → 1491.96] you may be able to serve
[1491.96 → 1493.74] and be in God's presence
[1493.74 → 1494.60] with joy,
[1495.14 → 1497.48] with overflowing joy.
[1498.20 → 1498.56] Why?
[1499.16 → 1500.60] Because there is joy
[1500.60 → 1502.16] out of gratitude.
[1502.96 → 1503.88] Out of gratitude,
[1504.30 → 1505.60] we have joy.
[1506.68 → 1508.96] This is the exact exhortation
[1508.96 → 1510.34] that Paul gives for the church
[1510.34 → 1511.50] in Thessalonians,
[1511.68 → 1512.56] where he says,
[1513.00 → 1514.54] it's a famous verse,
[1514.54 → 1516.50] rejoice always.
[1517.86 → 1518.88] Rejoice always.
[1520.12 → 1521.18] Pray continually.
[1522.12 → 1524.16] Give thanks in all circumstances,
[1525.06 → 1526.80] for this is God's will for you
[1526.80 → 1527.98] in Christ Jesus.
[1531.10 → 1532.70] As we come to a close this morning,
[1532.70 → 1534.16] just reflecting on today
[1534.16 → 1536.30] and what we have gone through,
[1537.38 → 1538.82] if this pandemic
[1538.82 → 1539.94] that we have gone through
[1539.94 → 1542.18] in our recent history
[1542.18 → 1543.68] has taught us anything.
[1544.72 → 1545.86] It is the value
[1545.86 → 1547.44] of being able to gather
[1547.44 → 1549.00] and be in God's presence
[1549.00 → 1550.48] as His people.
[1551.42 → 1553.04] To share in this joy
[1553.04 → 1556.30] as God's people together,
[1556.46 → 1557.22] as His sheep.
[1558.04 → 1560.00] I am in no way suggesting
[1560.00 → 1562.10] that we cannot be in God's presence
[1562.10 → 1564.00] in our daily individual lives,
[1564.50 → 1566.28] but our ultimate calling
[1566.28 → 1567.82] is to gather together.
[1569.82 → 1571.72] To gather together to worship.
[1572.18 → 1573.58] And it is,
[1573.62 → 1574.76] I think it is worth noting,
[1575.04 → 1576.02] just one more Hebrew
[1576.02 → 1578.16] fact for you.
[1579.30 → 1580.60] It is worth noting
[1580.60 → 1582.18] that grammatically speaking,
[1582.80 → 1584.12] all the imperatives
[1584.12 → 1586.22] or the commanding verbs
[1586.22 → 1587.56] in our psalm this morning
[1587.56 → 1589.12] are used
[1589.12 → 1592.12] toward the subject of
[1592.12 → 1593.22] you all.
[1593.58 → 1594.60] I know we don't say this
[1594.60 → 1595.04] in Canada.
[1595.72 → 1597.00] It's the plural you.
[1597.36 → 1597.78] It's not,
[1598.04 → 1599.72] hey, serve the Lord, you.
[1600.72 → 1601.36] Serve the Lord,
[1601.36 → 1602.48] Peter, you,
[1602.68 → 1603.48] just by yourself.
[1603.62 → 1604.26] Serve the Lord.
[1605.38 → 1605.86] It is,
[1606.38 → 1608.42] you all need to come together
[1608.42 → 1609.54] and serve the Lord.
[1610.64 → 1610.82] Yeah.
[1611.36 → 1612.80] Well, that got a little bit
[1612.80 → 1613.18] of a laugh.
[1613.38 → 1614.88] I can do a pretty good
[1614.88 → 1615.58] Texas accent,
[1615.68 → 1616.58] I do admit.
[1619.58 → 1621.04] All of us together,
[1621.54 → 1623.16] plural together,
[1623.80 → 1625.48] are called to serve,
[1625.70 → 1626.42] worship the Lord,
[1626.42 → 1628.00] and be in his presence
[1628.00 → 1631.20] because we have joy
[1631.20 → 1632.54] out of gratitude.
[1633.76 → 1635.60] Worship him with gladness.
[1636.12 → 1637.42] Give glorious praise
[1637.42 → 1638.64] with joyful songs
[1638.64 → 1640.00] to God our Father.
[1640.94 → 1642.28] Find joy out of gratitude.
[1643.66 → 1643.90] Amen.
[1644.20 → 1644.70] Let's pray.
[1644.70 → 1654.40] Father God,
[1654.98 → 1657.50] what else can we say
[1657.50 → 1658.32] but thank you?
[1660.82 → 1661.92] How can we
[1661.92 → 1663.70] come before you
[1663.70 → 1664.40] in your presence
[1664.40 → 1665.72] and not be thankful
[1665.72 → 1667.54] for what you have done,
[1668.06 → 1669.14] what you are doing,
[1669.14 → 1671.20] and what you will do
[1671.20 → 1672.48] for our lives,
[1672.48 → 1674.42] for all creation?
[1676.08 → 1677.44] Lord, we give you thanks
[1677.44 → 1679.50] for the good news of Christ.
[1680.28 → 1681.52] We give you thanks
[1681.52 → 1682.52] for your love
[1682.52 → 1683.22] and your goodness
[1683.22 → 1685.54] that you do not
[1685.54 → 1686.46] give up on us
[1686.46 → 1687.88] even though
[1687.88 → 1688.84] we sometimes
[1688.84 → 1689.66] give up on you.
[1691.86 → 1693.32] Lord, we give you thanks
[1693.32 → 1694.74] and we shout for joy
[1694.74 → 1696.74] out of this gratitude.
[1698.46 → 1699.58] We thank you so much
[1699.58 → 1700.24] for this morning.
[1700.96 → 1701.40] We thank you
[1701.40 → 1702.42] for all the volunteers
[1702.42 → 1703.24] all the leaders
[1703.24 → 1704.70] who serve you
[1704.70 → 1705.62] and worship you.
[1706.92 → 1708.10] Lord, we come before you
[1708.10 → 1709.16] once again with song.
[1710.04 → 1711.70] We use our musical talents.
[1712.94 → 1714.66] We use all the gifts
[1714.66 → 1715.68] that you have allowed us.
[1716.70 → 1717.12] And Lord,
[1717.22 → 1717.82] we want to give you
[1717.82 → 1718.70] all the glory
[1718.70 → 1719.94] because you deserve it.

[1724.18 → 1725.32] And we give you thanks.
[1725.80 → 1726.80] In Jesus' name we pray.
[1727.92 → 1728.30] Amen.
[1728.30 → 1730.78] I invite you to stand
[1730.78 → 1733.12] as we sing our song response.
[1733.12 → 1733.74] Thank you.
[1751.74 → 1752.42] Amen.
