[0.00 → 4.92] Well, good morning, Hope.
[5.96 → 13.08] You know, I just realized that this is actually the first Sunday in two years when our whole
[13.08 → 13.96] church is back together.
[15.04 → 16.78] We went, yeah, we can clap about that.
[21.16 → 26.00] We went to two services as a way of mitigating COVID risk, and here we are back together.
[26.14 → 29.72] And if you're kind of stuck in the back, I see that we put a bunch of chairs out back.
[29.72 → 33.88] It was initially my idea to bring us all back a little bit earlier this year because I
[33.88 → 36.84] wanted us to be around for our appreciation for those who are serving.
[37.28 → 40.96] And next Sunday, I want us all to be around for baptisms and professions of faith.
[41.28 → 43.42] And the Sunday after that, we're welcoming new members.
[43.64 → 46.84] And so there's a lot of celebration in the next few weeks, and it's just so good to be
[46.84 → 47.56] together for it.
[47.62 → 50.22] So you might want to arrive a little bit earlier next week.
[50.42 → 53.34] For those of you who are way in the back, just a little bit earlier, and you should be able
[53.34 → 54.92] to sit right in the front, right here.
[55.02 → 55.66] It's great seating.
[55.66 → 60.70] We're going to continue our series on unity, that they may be one.
[61.76 → 67.14] And we've started this series by sharing some of the sources of our conflict, sources of
[67.14 → 70.86] disunity, which Philippians 2 says are selfish ambition and vain conceit.
[71.82 → 77.70] Then we looked at the way in which Christ invites us to his own level of humility, this self-lowering
[77.70 → 78.10] love.
[78.10 → 81.10] What it means to bear with one another in love.
[81.68 → 85.82] Pastor Sid preached on what it means to forgive one another as Christ forgave us.
[86.84 → 91.02] And this morning, we're now going to shift gears to not just look at how do we live in
[91.02 → 95.92] unity, but to realize how much we need to live in unity in order to serve.
[96.64 → 100.90] That Christ brings all the diversity of the body, even here this morning, all the diverse
[100.90 → 104.72] gifts together in order to serve well.
[104.72 → 109.96] That we are brought in unity in order to serve our city and each other in a way that's going
[109.96 → 111.48] to bring life and blessing.
[112.64 → 117.56] So I invite you now to turn with me, if you have your Bible, digital or physical, turn or
[117.56 → 120.30] scroll with me to 1 Peter chapter 4.
[127.66 → 129.70] 1 Peter chapter 4, verse 7.
[129.70 → 133.82] The end of all things is near.
[134.94 → 138.66] Therefore, be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray.
[139.78 → 144.74] Above all, love each other deeply because love covers over a multitude of sins.
[145.74 → 147.94] Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
[148.94 → 153.54] Each of you should use whatever gifts you've received to serve others as faithful stewards of
[153.54 → 155.40] God's grace in its various forms.
[155.40 → 159.70] If you speak, you should do so as one who speaks the very words of God.
[160.24 → 166.22] If you serve, you should do so with the strength God provides so that in all things, God may
[166.22 → 167.62] be praised through Christ Jesus.
[168.30 → 171.30] To Him be the glory and power forever and ever.
[171.82 → 172.22] Amen.
[177.86 → 182.24] About four years ago, I was sitting for coffee with Jim Having.
[182.24 → 185.88] Jim Having is actually a pastor who once served in our church.
[186.40 → 190.00] And at the time of having the coffee with him, he was very involved in the development
[190.00 → 191.56] of the Coverdale Community Kitchen.
[192.20 → 195.78] Jim is one of the people who brought different churches in and wanted collaboration between
[195.78 → 197.30] churches for the good of the city.
[198.34 → 200.76] And as we shared coffee and as we caught up, actually, is Jim here?
[201.12 → 201.78] Jim, are you here somewhere?
[202.52 → 203.42] Oh, he's not here this morning.
[204.44 → 208.96] As we had coffee, Jim said to me a line that I have not forgotten and have thought a lot about
[208.96 → 209.80] since he said it.
[209.80 → 212.86] He shared about how he partnered with many businesses with the kitchen.
[213.06 → 215.18] There are a lot of nonprofits that are involved in the kitchen.
[215.28 → 218.96] But he said, you know, Dave, there's just nothing like the church.
[219.86 → 223.30] So there's no organization that quite works the way the church does.
[223.36 → 229.82] And at its best, the church brings together just a remarkable amount of creativity, ingenuity,
[230.40 → 230.98] generosity.
[231.32 → 234.00] They bring such a remarkable diversity of gifts.
[234.00 → 239.28] And when those come together, he says, it's just unbelievable what God can do.
[240.38 → 244.80] And of course, the Coverdale Community Kitchen itself is a testament to what happens when
[244.80 → 248.06] churches and believers come together for the common good in the city.
[248.14 → 251.84] And if you haven't been there, you should go and just see the amazing things that are
[251.84 → 253.20] done every day of the week.
[254.64 → 258.58] Now, what Jim said struck true to me, not only as a statement of what's true in the church,
[258.58 → 261.78] but also the tradition that we live in as believers.
[262.62 → 266.84] Although it's true that people of many different backgrounds come together and serve the common
[266.84 → 270.42] good, there's a sense in which this is the reputation the church has had for generations.
[271.60 → 274.36] You know, I think of a friend of ours named Stephanie.
[275.08 → 277.42] She serves as a nurse on what's called the Mercy Ship.
[277.52 → 278.52] Has anyone heard of the Mercy Ship?
[278.52 → 284.94] It's a giant ship, literally, that has brought together doctors and nurses from all over,
[285.12 → 290.02] and they literally go to the most needy places with no access to medical care, and they give
[290.02 → 293.82] all their time, they give all their resources, and they give away what is needed to bring
[293.82 → 295.16] treatment to those who have no access.
[295.86 → 297.36] It is a beautiful thing.
[298.22 → 299.90] Or I think of refugee sponsorship.
[300.66 → 305.50] The way that so many Christians quietly, some of whom just were on the stage, quietly look
[305.50 → 310.20] for ways to find people in crisis, fleeing war, fleeing terror, and give them a chance
[310.20 → 316.18] to start fresh in a safe place, in a community that will enfold them and love them, even if
[316.18 → 317.50] they don't share the same faith.
[318.40 → 324.36] I learned three years ago now that the very first refugee sponsorship in Canada was with
[324.36 → 324.68] Christians.
[325.66 → 329.02] Christians saw a particular need, and they actually called up the federal government.
[329.12 → 331.30] I'd love to have been a fly on the wall for that first phone call.
[331.38 → 332.08] Who did they call?
[332.30 → 334.60] They called someone in the federal government saying, hey, we see a need.
[334.60 → 338.08] We see people who are fleeing war, and can we bring them to Canada?
[338.44 → 340.94] And the person they talked to said, sure.
[341.80 → 347.16] And here we are, some many years later, our church itself, joining in the very good work
[347.16 → 349.52] of bringing sponsors of refugee families into our city.
[350.28 → 355.12] We have a tradition of collaborating and bringing gifts together for the sake of blessing.
[355.96 → 360.78] Think of the hospitals that have been built, many by Christians, orphanages, homeless shelters,
[360.78 → 362.22] rehabilitation centres.
[362.46 → 367.58] So many of these ideas are birthed by just a little group of Christians in some church
[367.58 → 370.62] basement drinking church coffee, which is not the best coffee.
[371.64 → 372.24] Not ours.
[372.30 → 372.96] Ours is from Honduras.
[373.04 → 373.50] It's amazing.
[374.46 → 377.36] They're drinking coffee, and they're saying, how can we help?
[377.88 → 379.06] Here's a need in our city.
[379.14 → 380.12] Here's a need in the world.
[380.12 → 384.08] How can we bring all the different gifts together that we have in our community to bless?
[384.84 → 390.20] That's how so many of these amazing ideas are born, by believers who believe they are sent
[390.20 → 391.44] to bless.
[392.30 → 397.08] And this runs deep, by the way, into the Christian view of what a human is.
[397.60 → 401.98] This is sort of a core conviction that believers have had throughout the generations that we
[401.98 → 404.42] don't just have gifts that are from nowhere.
[405.10 → 409.46] We have gifts that are from God, and we don't just get to hoard them or become wealthy through
[409.46 → 410.22] whatever we're good at.
[410.34 → 412.70] We get to use those to bless.
[413.64 → 418.24] To put it as simply as I can, we are created to serve.
[419.40 → 424.18] And Jim Having nailed it when he said, it's a beautiful thing when you see the diversity
[424.18 → 428.16] of all the gifts in the church coming together for service.
[429.66 → 435.08] Now, let's turn and look at how 1 Peter 4 speaks into this calling for the church to be
[435.08 → 436.18] a community of servants.
[436.18 → 441.48] I want to start by pointing out the fascinating way that 1 Peter 4 starts.
[441.58 → 442.76] Did you notice how he starts?
[443.60 → 446.24] He says, the end of all things is near.
[447.10 → 449.18] Well, that's ominous, don't you think?
[449.50 → 450.88] It's almost like a doomsday cry.
[450.98 → 452.42] The end of all things is near.
[452.96 → 457.44] And in my mind, I think of all the movies I've seen that talk about end time things or
[457.44 → 459.18] sort of what's going to be of the end.
[459.22 → 464.72] And it is always accompanied by chaos, by looting, by every person for themselves, violence,
[464.72 → 465.50] and all the rest.
[465.50 → 468.86] But that is not how Peter speaks in our passage.
[469.82 → 473.18] When Peter speaks of the end, he actually speaks with hope.
[474.04 → 474.86] Isn't that a beautiful thing?
[475.22 → 479.00] When Peter speaks of the end of all things, it's actually not an anxiety-inducing thing
[479.00 → 482.94] because for Peter, who lives in the biblical story, he knows where the story goes.
[483.04 → 486.84] And it ends with Jesus returning in glory and power.
[487.50 → 491.84] It ends with Jesus bringing renewal to his beautiful creation.
[491.84 → 494.78] Yes, it includes him judging sin.
[495.04 → 499.82] Yes, it includes Jesus putting an end to that which opposes his kingdom and those who actively
[499.82 → 501.16] resist his kingdom.
[501.38 → 506.00] But it finishes with a new creation for resurrected people to live in forever.
[506.32 → 507.68] That's the end of the story.
[509.36 → 511.44] Sin was defeated on the cross.
[511.44 → 513.74] Sin had not yet been eradicated.
[514.42 → 516.26] Believers still wait for that.
[517.22 → 520.66] And what Paul, Peter, I should say, is saying to the church in 1 Peter here is,
[521.30 → 522.30] be sober-minded.
[522.92 → 524.24] Know the time in which you live.
[524.30 → 526.30] You live between resurrection and return.
[526.38 → 528.34] And Jesus' return could be very soon.
[528.82 → 530.76] So live in light of what's coming.
[530.76 → 535.88] Or to put it differently, and I've said this before at Hope, I like this image, that the
[535.88 → 538.14] church is sort of a sneak preview of the future.
[538.94 → 542.52] You know, you go to a movie, and you know, you have to sit through like 30 minutes of sneak
[542.52 → 544.48] previews, and some of them are awful.
[544.98 → 547.92] But the good ones, you sort of nudge your spouse or your friend and say, we should watch
[547.92 → 548.68] that one, right?
[549.72 → 552.84] The church is like a good sneak preview of the coming kingdom.
[552.84 → 560.26] As the world watches the church live, it's almost like they say, wow, they love in a
[560.26 → 561.86] way that's sort of a picture of the future.
[562.34 → 566.64] There's a sense of grace and mercy and compassion and justice that sort of marks how I want the
[566.64 → 567.36] world to be.
[567.60 → 571.48] The church is a sneak preview of what is coming when Christ returns.
[572.18 → 576.94] And really what Peter is saying here is, I want you to live the way the future is going
[576.94 → 577.30] to be.
[577.50 → 579.06] That's really this passage in a nutshell.
[579.06 → 584.74] You know, Martin Luther, the famous reformer, or as some would say, the famous divider of
[584.74 → 589.80] the church, he is alleged to have said, so this is not verified, he has many quotes that
[589.80 → 592.52] are given to him, but one of them is this, and I quite like this quote.
[592.60 → 598.46] He says, I think, if I believe that the world were to end tomorrow, I would plant a tree today.
[600.02 → 600.90] Don't you love that quote?
[601.74 → 603.44] If indeed Martin Luther did say it.
[604.68 → 608.92] What he's basically saying is, I want to be part of what is going to be in the new
[608.92 → 612.22] world, and for him, there will be the beauty of trees.
[612.46 → 615.40] So I want to be doing what's going to be happening in the future.
[615.82 → 620.74] And the rest of this passage is Peter saying, hey church, I want you to be doing these specific
[620.74 → 624.18] things that are going to be happening when Christ returns and brings renewal.
[625.20 → 630.92] Or to put it differently, if Jesus returns, I want you church to be caught, you might say,
[630.92 → 632.08] doing these things.
[632.16 → 633.10] And here are the four things.
[633.16 → 633.38] You ready?
[633.38 → 634.36] Three, prayer.
[635.68 → 638.06] Two, loving one another deeply.
[639.02 → 641.70] Three, practicing hospitality without grumbling.
[642.08 → 642.56] No grumbling.
[643.40 → 645.48] And four, serving.
[646.40 → 649.16] Using whatever gifts God has given to serve.
[649.30 → 654.40] These are the things that Peter says, if Jesus returns tomorrow, that's exactly how he wants
[654.40 → 655.20] you to be caught.
[656.28 → 659.84] Loving, hospitable, prayer, serving.
[660.00 → 662.74] So let's look at them in the order that Peter describes them.
[662.74 → 666.94] Number one, he says, as you wait for Jesus to return, as you wait for the end of all things,
[667.60 → 667.78] pray.
[669.18 → 670.60] I find that fascinating.
[671.22 → 674.68] For me, when he says, you know, be alert and of sober mind, that's what he says right
[674.68 → 675.68] before so you can pray.
[675.78 → 677.86] Be alert and of sober mind so you can pray.
[678.32 → 681.40] And in my mind, I don't know if it's like this for you, but there's a reciprocal relationship
[681.40 → 681.72] there.
[682.20 → 685.06] I find prayer gives me the alert and sober mind.
[685.28 → 689.68] Prayer enables me to see the times in which I live, which are not times just to enjoy my consumer
[689.68 → 694.74] pleasures, times not just to enjoy whatever selfish desires I have, but times to be in
[694.74 → 696.32] conversation with the Father.
[696.88 → 701.16] And when I'm in conversation with the Father, I get a clear mind about why I live, the times
[701.16 → 704.10] in which I live, and how I should organize the rest of my short life.
[704.62 → 705.28] Do you have that?
[706.04 → 709.92] There's a sense in which prayer clarifies how we are to live.
[709.92 → 715.98] Moreover, if it's true that when Jesus returns, we're going to experience the fullness of the
[715.98 → 719.92] presence of God, we're going to see Jesus face to face, it makes sense that already now
[719.92 → 722.90] in the present, we get to be in conversation with our Father.
[724.14 → 726.56] And I'll say it again as I often do, He speaks.
[727.72 → 728.46] He listens.
[729.50 → 735.44] He responds in power according to His grace to the concerns and the hearts and the cries
[735.44 → 736.20] of His people.
[736.98 → 739.20] If you don't believe me, test it out and watch what He does.
[740.80 → 745.60] The second thing Paul says, as the church waits for the return of Jesus, the waits for
[745.60 → 750.56] the end of all things, he says, love one another deeply because love covers over a multitude
[750.56 → 751.40] of sins.
[752.06 → 757.14] Now, we've looked already in this series at the many passages that Paul says about loving
[757.14 → 759.58] one another, about bearing with one another in love.
[759.82 → 762.46] But I love the two things that Peter adds to what Paul has said.
[762.52 → 764.94] Maybe he read what Paul said, and he's like, I'm just going to make these additions.
[765.30 → 768.04] And his additions are, love one another deeply.
[768.04 → 771.26] And I think there's just an insight into the human condition there.
[771.34 → 775.98] It's like he knows that loving people is actually a lot harder than we think it is, especially
[775.98 → 779.94] when they hurt us, especially when they do destructive things in our families, in our
[779.94 → 780.34] communities.
[780.68 → 781.50] It's very hard.
[781.64 → 787.80] And so Peter's basically saying, the work you have to do is do the deep love in hard relationships
[787.80 → 790.78] with those strained people in your life.
[790.78 → 793.36] But then there's that peculiar line.
[793.42 → 795.98] Have you ever heard it, that love covers over a multitude of sins?
[796.28 → 797.28] Has anyone ever said that to you?
[798.18 → 801.30] This week I learned there's like four different interpretations of this, and I'm only going
[801.30 → 802.24] to give you the one I like.
[802.48 → 805.38] So if you disagree, you can go to the commentaries and read them up yourself.
[805.82 → 810.96] But I think when Peter says, love covers over a multitude of sins, what he's saying is,
[811.34 → 815.10] love enables you to be in the posture that is more ready to forgive.
[815.74 → 816.40] Does that make sense?
[816.96 → 819.14] It's not that love ignores sin.
[819.40 → 821.64] I don't think that's even possible in our human state.
[821.94 → 824.84] It's not that love just sort of doesn't even acknowledge that sin exists.
[824.92 → 830.68] It's like loving someone deeply means you are ready to forgive, even though you have been
[830.68 → 831.32] sinned against.
[832.10 → 834.40] Love covers over a multitude of sin.
[834.40 → 840.26] And while you're waiting for Jesus to return, church, love one another deeply.
[840.26 → 849.66] Thirdly, Peter says, as you wait for Jesus to return, as you wait for the end of all things,
[850.26 → 850.88] be hospitable.
[852.28 → 854.34] I just love that this is part of the four.
[854.70 → 855.92] Think of all the things Peter could say.
[856.00 → 858.30] Hey, when you're waiting for Jesus to return, do this, this, and this.
[858.42 → 861.38] I bet you wouldn't have guessed Peter to say, practice hospitality.
[862.06 → 864.86] That's one of the sort of the core things that they should be doing while they wait.
[864.96 → 865.58] Isn't that interesting?
[865.58 → 870.00] I don't know if any of you have seen the movie Look Up or Don't Look Up.
[870.06 → 870.80] Has anyone seen that movie?
[871.98 → 876.34] If you're into politics or very committed about your politics, it's going to poke at
[876.34 → 877.00] you in one way or another.
[877.06 → 879.14] It's a very politically satirical movie.
[879.64 → 883.76] But in that movie, the very end is sort of a catastrophe, the cataclysm, sort of the end
[883.76 → 884.34] of all things.
[884.42 → 888.18] And there's this beautiful scene where a very mixed group of people that don't even know
[888.18 → 890.38] each other very well are aware of what's happening.
[890.38 → 896.34] And they gather in their last moments to sit around the table, to make some perfect
[896.34 → 896.66] food.
[896.78 → 898.00] They're pouring perfect wine.
[898.08 → 900.66] They're all going to the grocery store and getting whatever they can find for this really
[900.66 → 901.08] fine meal.
[901.16 → 902.78] And they're giving thanks.
[902.92 → 904.64] In fact, there's a teenager who prays.
[905.34 → 908.56] And it's this beautiful scene of like in the middle of a difficulty, in the middle of
[908.56 → 913.48] turmoil around them, there they are practicing hospitality at the very end.
[915.82 → 919.06] Jesus depended on hospitality throughout his ministry.
[919.06 → 922.72] In fact, one author says Jesus' whole ministry is hospitality.
[923.02 → 928.08] He was either on his way to a meal, teaching over a meal, and discipling on the way from
[928.08 → 928.58] a meal.
[929.26 → 931.80] It was constantly packed with hospitality.
[932.08 → 937.14] He depended over and over and over again on people opening their homes, making meal preparation,
[937.28 → 941.40] which is a lot harder than than it is now, so that they could share meals and build friendship
[941.40 → 944.36] and learn the way of the kingdom over broken bread.
[945.00 → 945.90] It's a beautiful thing.
[949.06 → 950.16] Also think about this.
[951.12 → 955.92] The way that we're told the kingdom is going to be in the new creation is a banquet.
[956.98 → 960.48] It's one of my favourite images of Jesus returning, that there will be a banquet.
[960.68 → 962.46] It's described as this abundant feast.
[962.56 → 966.94] And so it makes sense then that as the church waits for that time as we live already now,
[967.00 → 971.34] what it will be like then, that we practice hospitality without grumbling.
[971.56 → 974.74] We've all been those people who practice hospitality with grumbling, but without grumbling.
[974.74 → 980.56] And it might be worth noting that in this season where we can finally regather, we can finally
[980.56 → 986.04] be with one another, it is the right time to reintroduce this very important practice
[986.04 → 991.08] of hospitality, opening our homes to people you might not know well and sharing a meal.
[991.60 → 996.14] And I hope you've had the experience, as I have, along with my wife and family, of going
[996.14 → 997.94] to someone's home or inviting someone into your home.
[998.00 → 999.14] You do not know well.
[999.82 → 1002.82] You do not know their story well, but there's something about sitting down around the table.
[1002.82 → 1004.16] You start sharing food.
[1004.30 → 1005.60] You start sharing stories.
[1005.96 → 1007.10] You start sharing memories.
[1007.58 → 1008.38] You start connecting.
[1008.82 → 1012.26] And there's something about that time together where you can leave a home even after one meal
[1012.26 → 1016.70] together and feel like we are now bonded together as people.
[1016.78 → 1017.42] Have you had that before?
[1018.22 → 1020.82] There is something powerful about hospitality.
[1021.00 → 1025.68] And in this season now, where formal ministry of this year is sort of coming to a slow, as things
[1025.68 → 1030.58] sort of go into the summer mode, the ministry of the church now, in my opinion, hospitality.
[1032.06 → 1036.84] The ministry that we can do in our very ordinary lives, wherever we live, is hospitality.
[1037.20 → 1041.30] Going for a walk, having a coffee, going to the Dublin, inviting people to your home.
[1041.82 → 1044.68] And you know, I would pick on a few people here in the church because I know they're so
[1044.68 → 1045.08] good at it.
[1045.22 → 1046.46] Go to Sonia Workman's.
[1046.78 → 1047.88] She's very good at hospitality.
[1048.04 → 1048.62] Some of you know.
[1050.20 → 1051.18] I'll pick on a few others.
[1051.30 → 1052.00] Sean Hamlin.
[1052.00 → 1054.16] He does very good smoked meat.
[1056.28 → 1057.90] Brad Powell also does smoke meat.
[1057.98 → 1059.52] Pick on the people who have meat smokers.
[1059.74 → 1061.74] Start there and work your way out.
[1064.28 → 1069.28] The fourth thing, and I'm going to focus for a few minutes on this, that Peter says to the
[1069.28 → 1073.52] church as they wait for Jesus to return, is to serve.
[1074.98 → 1076.74] Take the gifts you have and serve.
[1076.82 → 1078.18] And in fact, I'm going to read this passage.
[1078.28 → 1079.68] This is what we read in 1 Peter 4.
[1079.68 → 1085.32] Each of you should use whatever gifts you have received to serve others as faithful
[1085.32 → 1088.22] stewards of God's grace in its various forms.
[1088.72 → 1092.18] If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God.
[1092.46 → 1097.68] If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides so that in all things
[1097.68 → 1100.18] God may be praised through Christ Jesus.
[1100.74 → 1102.42] Now, that's a good word for the church.
[1103.10 → 1105.50] I'm just going to steal what Val did earlier.
[1105.50 → 1113.28] The basic point that he's making there is God gives gifts, and he pours those gifts into
[1113.28 → 1113.90] the church.
[1114.30 → 1118.66] And we have these gifts not so we can hoard them, but so that we can bless.
[1119.72 → 1122.76] It is not accidental that you are good at what you're good at.
[1122.82 → 1123.38] Did you know that?
[1123.96 → 1124.74] It's not accidental.
[1124.94 → 1129.40] It's not a fluke that you are just wired a certain way that you can manage the media booth
[1129.40 → 1130.12] and it's easy.
[1130.12 → 1133.52] When I go up to that media booth, it's like I'm sitting in the Star Trek Enterprise.
[1133.98 → 1135.10] It is so overwhelming.
[1135.46 → 1140.52] But for John and Casey and Kim and Vince and Greg, it is easy.
[1141.40 → 1143.26] That's not surprising.
[1144.58 → 1146.60] God gave you those gifts.
[1146.66 → 1147.20] Did you know that?
[1147.94 → 1149.54] That's again this deep Christian conviction.
[1149.68 → 1151.36] You're not just accidentally good at something.
[1151.44 → 1153.14] You're not just accidentally musical and gifted.
[1153.38 → 1155.20] You are given those gifts.
[1155.66 → 1156.30] And guess what?
[1156.30 → 1159.04] Well, other people don't have the same gifts as you.
[1160.02 → 1161.62] Other people can't do what you can do.
[1161.84 → 1166.44] And you need those gifts, and they need your gifts.
[1166.50 → 1167.14] Do you know this?
[1167.76 → 1170.96] Could you imagine how boring and empty this world would be if it was all on you?
[1172.20 → 1173.24] That's a depressing thought.
[1174.20 → 1179.14] Just today, you depended on the gifts of hundreds, if not thousands of people to be in your home,
[1179.22 → 1182.08] to take a shower, to have coffee, to get in a car and drive to the church.
[1182.34 → 1184.54] Think of all the people you've depended on just today.
[1184.54 → 1190.02] Just to be in a building, all the gifts for lights and all the rest that we do here in worship.
[1190.32 → 1192.52] You need the gifts of other people.
[1193.78 → 1197.36] Some of us are really, really, really organized.
[1198.44 → 1202.52] Melanie Eisen man, for example, who organized a community barbecue yesterday.
[1203.12 → 1204.10] And by the way, yeah.
[1204.36 → 1204.98] We can say it.
[1204.98 → 1215.80] And you may or may not know that some of us pastors depend heavily on those of us who are very organized.
[1217.14 → 1219.40] Some of us are very hospitable.
[1220.12 → 1223.34] Sonia Workman, Sean, Brad, and a bunch of others in our church.
[1224.22 → 1226.18] Some of us are social butterflies.
[1226.18 → 1230.60] And we can make people who are brand new to the church feel like they've been here for years.
[1231.76 → 1232.88] That's a gift.
[1234.32 → 1236.22] Let me just name a few that I wrote.
[1236.28 → 1237.68] And this is just a very small list.
[1237.76 → 1239.40] Some of you are encouragers.
[1240.32 → 1242.16] How we need those in this day.
[1242.80 → 1244.02] Some of you are helpers.
[1244.08 → 1245.70] You just show up, and you get it done.
[1246.02 → 1247.08] Candy Vander wood.
[1247.08 → 1250.00] Some of you are truth speakers.
[1250.18 → 1250.96] My own wife.
[1252.06 → 1252.50] Teachers.
[1253.00 → 1254.66] So many of those in our church.
[1255.00 → 1255.44] Discerners.
[1255.58 → 1256.82] Ken Vol knot, who is up here.
[1256.88 → 1258.76] One of the wise discerners of our church.
[1259.30 → 1260.36] Artistic creators.
[1260.66 → 1261.88] Look at all of this.
[1262.62 → 1263.38] Music makers.
[1263.50 → 1264.58] You heard it this morning.
[1265.66 → 1266.18] Builders.
[1267.12 → 1267.82] So grateful.
[1268.78 → 1270.70] Technical and mechanical buffs.
[1270.88 → 1271.48] Green thumbs.
[1271.64 → 1273.16] On and on the list goes.
[1273.48 → 1275.06] These are gifts.
[1275.06 → 1283.22] You cannot leave this morning without recognizing that whatever you are good at is given to you from the Father.
[1284.28 → 1286.40] And you are therefore not allowed to squander it.
[1287.00 → 1288.54] You are called to serve with it.
[1289.02 → 1294.34] And I love that Peter, just like Paul in other passages, he's not particularly concerned with some kind of hierarchy.
[1294.54 → 1296.66] Like there are gifts up here and there are gifts down here.
[1296.86 → 1300.94] There's like the spiritual gifts that actually matter and the sort of secular gifts that don't.
[1301.38 → 1303.84] And the example I've given before, and I always pick on John Holstein.
[1303.84 → 1310.40] It's not like you've got the missionaries who do really important spiritual work up here, and you've got the ICBC lawyers down here.
[1310.68 → 1311.72] Which is John Holstein.
[1311.84 → 1312.56] I love you, John.
[1312.74 → 1314.28] You are such a gift to the church.
[1314.58 → 1315.78] Don't you ever forget it.
[1316.24 → 1317.84] I've got to pick on a different group of people.
[1320.30 → 1321.42] All the gifts matter.
[1321.52 → 1323.82] In fact, I'm going to read for us a passage from Romans 12.
[1323.98 → 1326.38] This is Paul underscoring the same point.
[1326.38 → 1327.78] He writes,
[1327.78 → 1331.96] We have different gifts according to the grace given to each of us.
[1332.02 → 1334.92] If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith.
[1335.16 → 1336.52] If it's serving, then serve.
[1336.62 → 1338.04] If it's teaching, then teach.
[1338.32 → 1340.16] If it's to encourage, then give encouragement.
[1340.46 → 1342.36] If it's giving, give generously.
[1342.82 → 1344.42] If it's to lead, do it diligently.
[1344.82 → 1347.02] If it's to show mercy, do it cheerfully.
[1347.56 → 1348.66] I love that list.
[1348.74 → 1351.08] And I love that prophecy and serving are in the same list.
[1351.22 → 1354.72] Because there's no division between sort of, quote, the spiritual and the not spiritual.
[1354.90 → 1358.02] Serving, hospitality are the same as prophesying and speaking in tongues.
[1358.26 → 1362.24] And Paul and Peter's concern is, whatever you've been given, serve.
[1363.10 → 1365.00] And if you don't know what you've been given, talk to me.
[1365.04 → 1366.04] I'll tell you how you can serve.
[1367.36 → 1371.72] In fact, a great dinner table conversation as you gather for lunch this afternoon
[1371.72 → 1374.78] is simply go to the people around you in the table and say,
[1374.94 → 1375.86] Here's how I see your gifts.
[1375.86 → 1378.16] Because I've learned as I've done youth ministry,
[1378.66 → 1381.40] a lot of people struggle to know what's right in front of them.
[1381.58 → 1384.36] And it takes a spouse, a friend, a child, a parent to say,
[1384.46 → 1388.52] Hey, I don't know if you know this yet, but you're very good at teaching.
[1389.14 → 1391.84] I don't know if you know this yet, but you are so compassionate.
[1392.36 → 1394.74] You should consider a vocation where you are caring.
[1395.00 → 1398.34] I don't know if you know this yet, but you are bright, and you are capable of teaching.
[1398.44 → 1399.26] You should consider that.
[1399.30 → 1399.86] On and on.
[1400.00 → 1403.36] Make sure you take the time to speak those words of encouragement
[1403.36 → 1406.46] and pull out the gifts of one another in your own family,
[1406.58 → 1407.96] in your own small group and community.
[1410.66 → 1413.62] Now here's the basic point I want to underscore along with this.
[1414.28 → 1420.86] Our church, every church, is only healthy insofar as all the gifts are being exercised.
[1420.86 → 1422.36] I'll say it again.
[1422.92 → 1428.28] The church of Jesus is healthy only insofar as all the gifts are being exercised.
[1428.78 → 1432.96] If the church is just a few people doing a few things, we're in trouble.
[1433.60 → 1436.00] And I think my favourite illustration on this comes from Nicky Umbel.
[1436.54 → 1438.70] Nicky Umbel is one of the people who started Alpha Ministry.
[1439.24 → 1441.84] And he gives the illustration of the church as a football stadium.
[1441.84 → 1446.94] And he says, in a football stadium, you have 30,000 people sitting on their seats
[1446.94 → 1448.80] who desperately need exercise.
[1449.38 → 1454.70] And they are cheering on 30 people in the field running around like crazy
[1454.70 → 1456.54] who desperately need a break.
[1457.76 → 1459.08] He says, that's the church.
[1460.26 → 1462.74] Tons of people who are like, yeah, cheering on those other people.
[1462.82 → 1464.56] And those people who are doing it, they're like, I need help.
[1464.64 → 1465.24] I need help.
[1465.70 → 1469.98] And I may or may not suggest that Melanie Eisen man was a week ago one of those people.
[1469.98 → 1472.38] And then we came through and the people served.
[1473.32 → 1474.92] Or maybe other people put it differently.
[1475.08 → 1475.42] You've heard this.
[1475.50 → 1476.06] The 80-20.
[1476.22 → 1478.48] We have 20% of the church doing 80% of the work.
[1478.64 → 1480.68] Then 80% of the church not using the gifts.
[1480.90 → 1484.72] And let me just say as frankly as I can, that is an unhealthy church.
[1485.74 → 1487.46] That church is headed for disaster.
[1488.12 → 1489.90] In fact, that church is going to burn out people.
[1490.44 → 1492.78] It's going to leave people frustrated with their fellow believers.
[1492.88 → 1497.08] It's going to create tension saying, why aren't so-and-so and so-and-so serving?
[1497.20 → 1498.20] Because they have gifts too.
[1498.20 → 1502.32] And I've seen this in church where there's people who serve so faithfully, but they become
[1502.32 → 1508.46] so jaded because they feel so lonely and unsupported by the rest of the body.
[1511.02 → 1512.44] Now, I can still remember.
[1512.60 → 1514.34] In fact, I don't think I'll ever forget this.
[1514.72 → 1516.66] Last, last April.
[1517.18 → 1519.68] So right after COVID started.
[1519.68 → 1525.12] I remember when we had to make decisions as leaders and council to stop all of our ministries.
[1525.32 → 1529.82] You know, I remember foolishly arguing if we cut our church in half, we had two services
[1529.82 → 1530.94] of 200, it'd be safe.
[1531.02 → 1534.94] And then one of our fellow wise brothers said to me, Dave, I don't think you're understanding
[1534.94 → 1535.74] the risk of COVID.
[1536.12 → 1537.90] And then things really started shutting down.
[1538.56 → 1539.80] And so we started ending our ministry.
[1539.92 → 1540.82] Small groups couldn't meet.
[1540.92 → 1542.06] This gathering wasn't happening.
[1542.30 → 1542.66] Cornerstone.
[1542.66 → 1544.12] All the ministry stopped.
[1544.22 → 1548.28] And I remember the first Saturday, we pre-recorded a service.
[1548.56 → 1551.18] Dave Kimber, Joel Herod, who's on the drums, and Dave Herod.
[1551.42 → 1553.42] There was only four of us in the building.
[1553.96 → 1555.46] And they were separated from each other.
[1555.54 → 1556.08] I was separated.
[1556.16 → 1557.18] We were sanitizing everything.
[1557.60 → 1561.40] And they pre-recorded this sermon where I was trying to like muster up the social energy
[1561.40 → 1562.90] because there's nobody in the room.
[1563.30 → 1565.64] And then we all went home, and I was turning off all the lights.
[1565.74 → 1567.12] And I just walked through this sanctuary.
[1567.26 → 1568.12] There are no seats in here.
[1568.12 → 1568.98] And I walked through the foyer.
[1569.06 → 1569.50] The lights were on.
[1569.74 → 1571.38] There are no children running around.
[1571.78 → 1572.90] There's nobody in nursery.
[1573.14 → 1574.02] Nobody in Cornerstone.
[1574.12 → 1575.30] There's no one drinking coffee.
[1575.42 → 1576.36] There's no one laughing.
[1576.72 → 1577.88] There's no conversation.
[1578.06 → 1582.68] I remember saying out loud in this empty space, this isn't church.
[1584.44 → 1586.70] This isn't church.
[1587.28 → 1593.04] And I have not yet taken for granted how beautiful it is to have kids spilling cups all over the
[1593.04 → 1596.92] sanctuary and children making messes in the foyer and denting the walls.
[1596.92 → 1599.44] Sorry, Bob Craig, who's already painted it and needs it again.
[1599.76 → 1604.24] I do not take for granted the mess we make as a community because it's a sign that we're
[1604.24 → 1606.00] doing what we're called to do.
[1606.86 → 1610.88] And it is a delightful noise to have our nursery children and our Cornerstone children running
[1610.88 → 1613.26] upstairs because ministry is happening.
[1613.86 → 1615.10] Gifts are being used.
[1615.42 → 1621.48] And church, the health of the church is all the diverse gifts that all of us have being
[1621.48 → 1624.16] brought into unity through service.
[1624.16 → 1627.62] God is the giver of the gift.
[1628.42 → 1631.48] We are the ones who get the gift, and we don't get to hoard it.
[1631.56 → 1633.06] It's given so that we serve.
[1633.60 → 1639.92] And it is, as Jim Having put it, a beautiful thing when churches bring the gifts together
[1639.92 → 1641.20] to bless.
[1643.16 → 1643.60] Amen.
[1643.60 → 1650.20] And let me just say, now that we're experiencing a sort of lifting of COVID restrictions and
[1650.20 → 1654.04] the regathering that Andre mentioned, it's time for us to hear afresh.
[1654.22 → 1655.62] And maybe this is a word of conviction.
[1655.82 → 1657.24] If the shoe fits, it's for you.
[1657.66 → 1659.64] But this is what Peter says, and I'll read it again.
[1659.74 → 1660.10] He says,
[1660.20 → 1664.60] Each of you should use whatever gift you've received to serve others.
[1665.14 → 1665.90] I'll say it again.
[1666.34 → 1670.72] Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others.
[1670.72 → 1672.82] That means you can't squander it.
[1673.20 → 1674.58] You're not allowed to sit and do nothing.
[1675.00 → 1677.18] You're not allowed to sort of waste the time you've been given.
[1677.56 → 1681.12] You are called not by Pastor Dave, not by the elders of the church.
[1681.54 → 1686.74] You are called by Christ, the giver of gifts, into service in his body to bless.
[1687.76 → 1691.62] And perhaps it's the season for many of us to say, I need to get back in the game.
[1691.62 → 1695.28] I need to use the gifts I've given because life is short.
[1695.70 → 1698.96] The need is great, and the church has work to do.
[1700.60 → 1704.42] So to summarize, Peter says,
[1705.00 → 1707.04] Brothers and sisters, the end is near.
[1708.36 → 1712.38] And don't be afraid because the one who's coming is Jesus Christ who will eradicate sin
[1712.38 → 1716.60] and establish a beautiful restored world for resurrected bodies to enjoy forever.
[1716.60 → 1719.92] But while you wait, be aware of the time.
[1720.88 → 1725.36] Be people who pray, people who love each other deeply, people who practice hospitality,
[1725.58 → 1727.68] and people who serve.
[1728.68 → 1731.92] And what a delight it would be if Christ came even this week
[1731.92 → 1736.36] and He caught the ordinary members of Hope Community Church serving.
[1738.84 → 1741.98] I want to conclude with a quote that Pastor Misha sent me this week.
[1741.98 → 1744.82] It comes from a woman named Irma Bombe ck.
[1745.66 → 1746.64] And she says,
[1748.12 → 1751.42] When I stand before God at the end of my life,
[1751.78 → 1756.28] I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left.
[1756.58 → 1761.58] And I could say, I used everything you gave me.
[1762.74 → 1763.42] Let's pray.
[1767.16 → 1768.80] Father, we thank you for your word.
[1768.80 → 1771.36] And we thank you that Jesus is coming.
[1772.30 → 1775.38] We pray that you would make us as a church alert and sober-minded,
[1775.54 → 1777.88] that you'd wake us up from the slumber of indifference,
[1778.52 → 1781.06] that you'd wake us up from the distraction of our cultural story
[1781.06 → 1785.38] to see that you rule, and you will return, and you will make all things new.
[1786.56 → 1790.40] And Lord, we pray that we would be caught on that day serving,
[1791.12 → 1793.68] that we would be caught loving one another deeply,
[1794.10 → 1796.42] that we would be caught in conversation with you,
[1796.42 → 1798.62] and we'd be caught being hospitable.
[1799.68 → 1801.66] For that to happen, Lord, we need your strength.
[1801.88 → 1802.60] We need your power.
[1802.74 → 1805.42] And so we ask that you would pour out your spirit on us
[1805.42 → 1808.98] and make us faithful servants of the kingdom of God.
[1809.52 → 1809.82] Amen.
[1811.82 → 1814.40] I invite you to stand with me our song of response.
[1814.40 → 1816.40] And we'll thank you forиться.
[1816.46 → 1817.52] Thank you very much.
[1817.56 → 1819.92] Thank you so much.
[1822.02 → 1822.28] You have a belt.
[1825.36 → 1826.52] obi is a right to travel test protecting the thoughts and problem,
[1826.58 → 1827.52] and keep your hands being fixed.
[1827.56 → 1831.16] Pastor from the BSA Committee on the toочноlema perspective,

[1832.32 → 1833.22] Please vote for the group.
