[0.00 --> 8.12]  thank you for passion thank you Val also for that prayer every now and then you feel like
[8.12 --> 11.98]  someone's prayed or they preached your sermon through a prayer before you preach it so I'm
[11.98 --> 20.04]  grateful for that that's okay we're traveling through Advent in the prophecy about a coming
[20.04 --> 25.68]  child a coming king and words spoken about this child who is Jesus and we've looked so far if
[25.68 --> 30.36]  you've been in with us in Advent and how Jesus is our wonderful counselor embodying the wisdom of God
[30.36 --> 36.58]  how Jesus is our mighty God that he does what only God can do that he is our everlasting father he
[36.58 --> 41.48]  rules and establishes a kingdom with paternal love and care and this morning we're looking at the way
[41.48 --> 46.84]  in which Jesus is our prince of peace and I would like for us if you have your Bible to read through
[46.84 --> 51.82]  Isaiah 9 again we're going to start at verse 2 in Isaiah 9
[51.82 --> 63.00]  the people walking in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of deep darkness
[63.00 --> 69.66]  a light has dawned you have enlarged the nation and increased their joy they rejoice before you
[69.66 --> 75.92]  as the people rejoice at the harvest as soldiers rejoice when dividing the plunder for as in the
[75.92 --> 81.70]  days of Midian's defeat you have shattered the yoke that burdens them the bar across their
[81.70 --> 88.34]  shoulders the rod of their oppressor every warrior's boot used in battle and every garment rolled in
[88.34 --> 96.90]  blood will be destined for burning will be fuel for the fire for to us a child is born to us a son is
[96.90 --> 104.92]  given and the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor mighty God
[104.92 --> 111.56]  everlasting father prince of the increase of the increase of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end
[111.56 --> 118.04]  he will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom establishing it and upholding it with justice and righteousness
[118.04 --> 124.68]  from that time on and forever the zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this
[124.68 --> 136.68]  this week in preparing for the sermon I did a bit of a deep dive or you might say a rabbit trail of reading on war and peace and peace treaties
[136.68 --> 153.32]  and one of the things that I came away from that reading with is a deep appreciation for living at a time of relative peace you need to know that what we experience right here in Canada that is the absence of war to live here at this time in this situation is very rare on a global scale and on a historical scale
[153.32 --> 183.30]  one of the articles I came across said that in the last get this the last 3100 years of recorded history only 286 of those years were years of peace in our world and if my math is correct that's 8% that's to say 92% of the last 3100 years were years of war years of conflict years of division between nations between kingdoms between people groups that's staggering
[183.32 --> 211.32]  92% of the time our world could not get along to such a degree that tanks were moved bombs were dropped soldiers were sent in and it begs the question at least for me that big sort of first order question why are we this way why is it that 92% of the time the last 3100 years we chose war over peace we chose to invade and create conflict rather than find a way to reconcile
[211.32 --> 216.78]  how would you answer that question why is it that we are this way
[216.78 --> 224.78]  seems to me that the only solution or the only potential answer that gets to the heart of it is found in Genesis 3
[224.78 --> 228.04]  where it talks of this mystery of iniquity
[228.04 --> 231.54]  this disease over this world called sin
[231.54 --> 236.26]  the power that messes with us in deep profound destructive ways
[236.26 --> 240.80]  there's a writer by the name of Neil Plantinga who has written a whole book on sin
[240.80 --> 242.98]  very riveting nighttime bed read
[242.98 --> 245.80]  and in this book on sin he gives this description
[245.80 --> 249.48]  of how sin works and it's stuck with me because I think it nails
[249.48 --> 251.72]  how strange and wrong it is he says
[251.72 --> 254.54]  inexplicably that is to say you can't explain it
[254.54 --> 257.14]  and irrationally it doesn't make sense
[257.14 --> 259.66]  humans from the time of Adam and Eve
[259.66 --> 261.70]  have chosen to live
[261.70 --> 263.48]  against what is good for them
[263.48 --> 268.02]  he goes on to say we choose to live against our God who is good
[268.02 --> 269.94]  we choose to live against each other
[269.94 --> 272.80]  we choose to live against the created world around us
[272.80 --> 277.12]  and we choose mysteriously even to live against what is good for ourselves
[277.12 --> 280.42]  that's the predicament we are in
[280.42 --> 282.96]  and not just on a macro scale
[282.96 --> 285.98]  with governments and with nations invading and fighting with one another
[285.98 --> 288.36]  I'm talking on a personal level as well
[288.36 --> 292.40]  you don't need to look far to find out that the human condition leads to division
[292.40 --> 293.14]  right?
[293.80 --> 294.68]  think of cities
[294.68 --> 296.56]  the division between ethnic groups
[296.56 --> 298.74]  think of division in your workplaces
[298.74 --> 301.18]  that person in the cubicle next to you
[301.18 --> 303.70]  who's gossiping about the person on that side of you
[303.70 --> 306.76]  or perhaps you're that person who's in conflict with the person in that cubicle
[306.76 --> 308.90]  think of your extended families
[308.90 --> 310.02]  your marriages
[310.02 --> 312.22]  your relationship with your kids or your parents
[312.22 --> 314.80]  division is everywhere
[314.80 --> 317.38]  and I would wager a guess to say that
[317.38 --> 318.54]  I'm not going to give a percentage
[318.54 --> 320.68]  but a percentage of people right here this morning
[320.68 --> 323.20]  who are not actually excited about the Christmas dinner
[323.20 --> 325.88]  because we're going to be gathering with those family members
[325.88 --> 329.32]  those extended relatives who we do not have peace with
[329.32 --> 331.00]  we're in division with
[331.00 --> 334.56]  the human condition is one of conflict and division
[334.56 --> 336.38]  and we need to name that reality
[336.38 --> 339.54]  as we now hear Isaiah 9 speak prophetically
[339.54 --> 341.02]  and audaciously
[341.02 --> 342.32]  about a king
[342.32 --> 343.98]  who is the prince of peace
[343.98 --> 346.92]  into a situation of conflict
[346.92 --> 348.02]  Isaiah says
[348.02 --> 350.08]  a child is coming
[350.08 --> 351.96]  who will be a king
[351.96 --> 353.52]  and he's going to establish a kingdom
[353.52 --> 354.68]  and he's going to demonstrate
[354.68 --> 356.18]  the character of the father
[356.18 --> 358.24]  he's going to reveal the power of the father
[358.24 --> 361.30]  and he's going to establish a kingdom of peace
[361.30 --> 363.20]  that's going to last forever
[363.20 --> 366.22]  that's an outrageous prophecy
[366.22 --> 367.70]  and don't forget
[367.70 --> 370.10]  who this is being prophesied to
[370.10 --> 372.14]  it's being prophesied to the nation of Israel
[372.14 --> 373.92]  and we've looked at this in the past few sermons
[373.92 --> 376.86]  how Israel at the time of Isaiah's prophecy
[376.86 --> 378.74]  is experiencing Assyria
[378.74 --> 379.74]  this big world empire
[379.74 --> 381.40]  pressing down its power
[381.40 --> 382.52]  taking over its cities
[382.52 --> 384.22]  putting people into subjugation
[384.22 --> 387.30]  and here Isaiah is prophesying to them
[387.30 --> 389.86]  a coming child is going to be here
[389.86 --> 391.54]  and he's bringing a kingdom of peace
[391.54 --> 393.88]  that's an audacious claim
[393.88 --> 396.64]  and I'm convinced
[396.64 --> 398.46]  as I've been studying this passage
[398.46 --> 399.46]  over the last four weeks
[399.46 --> 401.48]  that the primary goal of this prophecy
[401.48 --> 403.52]  from God through Isaiah to Israel
[403.52 --> 404.74]  is to give them hope
[404.74 --> 406.32]  I'm convinced that
[406.32 --> 407.90]  what Isaiah wants to give the people
[407.90 --> 409.40]  is that security
[409.40 --> 411.40]  that God has not forgotten
[411.40 --> 412.92]  as they think of
[412.92 --> 414.12]  is their future safe
[414.12 --> 414.98]  are their kids safe
[414.98 --> 416.38]  will they be protected from Assyria
[416.38 --> 416.92]  God is saying
[416.92 --> 418.06]  I have not forgotten
[418.06 --> 420.18]  I've made promises to Abraham
[420.18 --> 421.18]  Isaac and Jacob
[421.18 --> 422.56]  I've made a covenant
[422.56 --> 423.36]  to my people
[423.36 --> 424.36]  and I have not forgotten
[424.36 --> 426.68]  and the backdrop of Isaiah 9
[426.68 --> 427.90]  is actually what I think is
[427.90 --> 429.34]  the promise made to David
[429.34 --> 430.18]  King David
[430.18 --> 432.18]  as David was ruling over Israel
[432.18 --> 433.22]  God made a covenant to him
[433.22 --> 433.54]  and he said
[433.54 --> 435.28]  David I'm going to bring
[435.28 --> 436.46]  out of your descendants
[436.46 --> 438.38]  a king who's going to establish
[438.38 --> 438.78]  a kingdom
[438.78 --> 440.24]  that's going to last forever
[440.24 --> 441.90]  and Isaiah 9 is saying
[441.90 --> 443.82]  that child is coming
[443.82 --> 445.58]  wait for him
[445.58 --> 449.40]  now I'd want us to pause
[449.40 --> 450.94]  and ask a very important question
[450.94 --> 451.98]  about this phrase
[451.98 --> 452.88]  prince of peace
[452.88 --> 454.06]  and the question is
[454.06 --> 454.98]  what does Isaiah mean
[454.98 --> 456.02]  when he says peace
[456.02 --> 457.74]  because in our heads
[457.74 --> 458.44]  I'm guessing
[458.44 --> 459.28]  we have a few options
[459.28 --> 460.12]  that pop in mind
[460.12 --> 462.12]  one is the absence of conflict
[462.12 --> 462.44]  right
[462.44 --> 463.64]  war and all the rest
[463.64 --> 465.24]  it's the absence of those things
[465.24 --> 465.66]  or
[465.66 --> 467.28]  I think in the modern west
[467.28 --> 468.12]  we often think of peace
[468.12 --> 469.26]  as sort of a state of mind
[469.26 --> 470.46]  an inner tranquility
[470.46 --> 472.26]  but I want us to know
[472.26 --> 473.66]  and never leave this place thinking
[473.66 --> 475.90]  Isaiah when he speaks of peace
[475.90 --> 476.76]  has a much bigger
[476.76 --> 477.16]  richer
[477.16 --> 478.68]  fuller sense in mind
[478.68 --> 480.38]  in fact the word peace
[480.38 --> 481.40]  you might know where it's from
[481.40 --> 482.46]  is the word shalom
[482.46 --> 483.62]  that's the Hebrew word for peace
[483.62 --> 484.14]  you've heard it
[484.14 --> 485.60]  and it gets at this
[485.60 --> 486.62]  rich sense of
[486.62 --> 488.46]  things being brought back together
[488.46 --> 489.60]  a sense of completeness
[489.60 --> 490.66]  a sense of wholeness
[490.66 --> 492.02]  a sense of broken pieces
[492.02 --> 494.18]  being fit back in harmony together
[494.18 --> 495.14]  that's shalom
[495.14 --> 496.72]  and the Old Testament
[496.72 --> 497.54]  speaks of peace
[497.54 --> 498.02]  shalom
[498.02 --> 499.48]  in a variety of ways
[499.48 --> 500.94]  for example
[500.94 --> 502.20]  when two kings are at war
[502.20 --> 503.56]  and that war comes to an end
[503.56 --> 504.28]  that is now
[504.28 --> 505.56]  a situation of shalom
[505.56 --> 507.36]  or when a husband and wife
[507.36 --> 508.56]  Proverbs talks about this
[508.56 --> 509.26]  when there's quarrels
[509.26 --> 510.26]  that are reconciled
[510.26 --> 511.12]  that couple then
[511.12 --> 512.52]  is brought into shalom
[512.52 --> 514.26]  or when someone breaks
[514.26 --> 515.52]  someone else's property
[515.52 --> 517.20]  Deuteronomy gives them rules
[517.20 --> 518.24]  on how to make restitution
[518.24 --> 519.78]  and bring shalom
[519.78 --> 521.40]  and what matters
[521.40 --> 522.30]  to remember here
[522.30 --> 523.10]  is that when Isaiah
[523.10 --> 523.96]  is talking about peace
[523.96 --> 525.68]  it's all of life
[525.68 --> 527.72]  it's not just spiritual peace
[527.72 --> 528.26]  with the Father
[528.26 --> 529.72]  it's relational peace
[529.72 --> 530.92]  economic peace
[530.92 --> 531.92]  political peace
[531.92 --> 533.00]  familial peace
[533.00 --> 534.06]  it's pushing back
[534.06 --> 534.56]  the darkness
[534.56 --> 537.64]  in every area of life
[537.64 --> 539.14]  and Isaiah wants
[539.14 --> 539.88]  everyone to hear
[539.88 --> 540.42]  this prophecy
[540.42 --> 540.88]  and realize
[540.88 --> 541.54]  that the prince
[541.54 --> 542.06]  who's coming
[542.06 --> 542.86]  is bringing
[542.86 --> 544.38]  that kind of peace
[544.38 --> 545.74]  not just one piece
[545.74 --> 546.24]  of peace here
[546.24 --> 547.00]  in one part of your life
[547.00 --> 548.22]  not just one relationship
[548.22 --> 549.02]  of peace with the Father
[549.02 --> 550.94]  but total wholeness
[550.94 --> 551.54]  and harmony
[551.54 --> 552.78]  to the entirety
[552.78 --> 553.58]  of creation
[553.58 --> 555.72]  it's an audacious claim
[555.72 --> 557.68]  or to put it
[557.68 --> 558.46]  in a totally different way
[558.46 --> 559.50]  than I said a few weeks ago
[559.50 --> 560.84]  the peace that Isaiah
[560.84 --> 562.08]  is prophesying about
[562.08 --> 563.40]  is a restoration
[563.40 --> 564.66]  to live the way
[564.66 --> 565.52]  we were created
[565.52 --> 567.54]  that's what he's speaking about
[567.54 --> 569.00]  fast forward
[569.00 --> 569.66]  to Luke 2
[569.66 --> 571.08]  you have the angel
[571.08 --> 571.58]  showing up
[571.58 --> 572.32]  to these shepherds
[572.32 --> 573.32]  who are tending their flock
[573.32 --> 574.64]  and every time I think
[574.64 --> 575.06]  of the shepherds
[575.06 --> 575.44]  and their flock
[575.44 --> 576.00]  I think of all
[576.00 --> 576.86]  the Christmas pageants
[576.86 --> 577.70]  I was forced to be in
[577.70 --> 578.14]  as a kid
[578.14 --> 579.12]  and that was the role
[579.12 --> 579.54]  I got
[579.54 --> 580.10]  and I was convinced
[580.10 --> 580.82]  it's because my dad
[580.82 --> 581.66]  had a farm with sheep
[581.66 --> 582.14]  and so they thought
[582.14 --> 582.84]  I should be a shepherd
[582.84 --> 583.34]  in the play
[583.34 --> 584.46]  or it's because
[584.46 --> 586.26]  you didn't have to speak
[586.26 --> 586.70]  as a shepherd
[586.70 --> 587.36]  so it was safe
[587.36 --> 588.04]  nevertheless
[588.04 --> 589.54]  Luke 2
[589.54 --> 590.68]  the angels show up
[590.68 --> 591.34]  to these shepherds
[591.34 --> 591.78]  and they say
[591.78 --> 592.32]  good news
[592.32 --> 593.16]  don't be afraid
[593.16 --> 594.76]  a savior is born in Israel
[594.76 --> 595.40]  and all of a sudden
[595.40 --> 596.48]  the heavens open
[596.48 --> 597.50]  and the angels
[597.50 --> 599.02]  are singing praise
[599.02 --> 599.82]  and what do they say
[599.82 --> 601.06]  glory to God
[601.06 --> 601.72]  on the highest
[601.72 --> 603.10]  and peace on earth
[603.10 --> 605.38]  and there's no mistake
[605.38 --> 606.58]  that the peace
[606.58 --> 607.80]  that Luke 2
[607.80 --> 608.48]  is talking about
[608.48 --> 608.86]  is saying
[608.86 --> 609.86]  this child
[609.86 --> 611.06]  prophesied in Isaiah 9
[611.06 --> 611.88]  the coming king
[611.88 --> 613.44]  the peace he's talking about
[613.44 --> 614.40]  is now coming
[614.40 --> 615.18]  through this child
[615.18 --> 616.06]  in Bethlehem
[616.06 --> 617.46]  the peace has come
[617.46 --> 620.00]  and we're going to ask
[620.00 --> 620.42]  the question
[620.42 --> 621.00]  that we've asked
[621.00 --> 621.56]  throughout the last
[621.56 --> 622.14]  number of weeks
[622.14 --> 623.52]  how is it then
[623.52 --> 625.28]  that Jesus Christ
[625.28 --> 626.44]  born in Bethlehem
[626.44 --> 627.64]  lives out
[627.64 --> 628.52]  and demonstrates
[628.52 --> 629.88]  that peace
[629.88 --> 631.06]  that holistic
[631.06 --> 631.98]  shalom
[631.98 --> 633.36]  that harmony
[633.36 --> 635.38]  and I think
[635.38 --> 635.88]  the first thing
[635.88 --> 636.52]  I'd want to say
[636.52 --> 637.50]  is that Jesus himself
[637.50 --> 638.96]  is peace
[638.96 --> 640.50]  there's a sense
[640.50 --> 640.80]  in which
[640.80 --> 641.58]  as you look at
[641.58 --> 642.50]  Jesus in his ministry
[642.50 --> 643.52]  he reflects the way
[643.52 --> 644.36]  we were all created
[644.36 --> 644.78]  to live
[644.78 --> 646.18]  Jesus was at peace
[646.18 --> 646.76]  with his father
[646.76 --> 647.40]  he was at peace
[647.40 --> 648.02]  with other people
[648.02 --> 648.66]  he was at peace
[648.66 --> 649.96]  with the non-human creation
[649.96 --> 650.56]  he was at peace
[650.56 --> 651.24]  with himself
[651.24 --> 652.82]  he was whole
[652.82 --> 653.60]  he was in harmony
[653.60 --> 654.70]  he's a reflection
[654.70 --> 655.76]  of what we were created
[655.76 --> 656.26]  to be
[656.26 --> 657.36]  and live with
[657.36 --> 659.14]  I don't know
[659.14 --> 659.60]  how many of us
[659.60 --> 660.00]  have seen
[660.00 --> 660.84]  the TV series
[660.84 --> 661.68]  The Chosen
[661.68 --> 663.18]  has anyone seen that?
[663.72 --> 664.26]  a few people
[664.26 --> 664.80]  oh
[664.80 --> 665.90]  less than that
[665.90 --> 666.36]  I have service
[666.36 --> 667.38]  and I don't know
[667.38 --> 667.84]  what to make of it
[667.84 --> 668.72]  I've only seen five episodes
[668.72 --> 669.56]  but I like what I see
[669.56 --> 670.94]  but what I'm compelled by
[670.94 --> 671.64]  in that show
[671.64 --> 673.42]  is the way they describe
[673.42 --> 674.48]  Jesus
[674.48 --> 675.54]  and his being
[675.54 --> 676.50]  how he is at peace
[676.50 --> 677.00]  there's a sense
[677.00 --> 677.46]  in which he lives
[677.46 --> 678.00]  with joy
[678.00 --> 678.80]  and contentment
[678.80 --> 679.32]  and love
[679.32 --> 679.90]  and compassion
[679.90 --> 680.84]  and you see him
[680.84 --> 681.06]  and you think
[681.06 --> 681.92]  that's what I want
[681.92 --> 682.44]  for myself
[682.44 --> 683.50]  he embodies the peace
[683.50 --> 685.00]  you want in your own life
[685.00 --> 686.74]  but not only does he live it
[686.74 --> 687.28]  and embody it
[687.28 --> 687.90]  he brings it
[687.90 --> 689.12]  wherever he goes
[689.12 --> 690.38]  the peace of Jesus
[690.38 --> 691.10]  is the peace that he
[691.10 --> 692.72]  establishes in his world
[692.72 --> 694.22]  and you watch his ministry
[694.22 --> 694.80]  and you see
[694.80 --> 695.96]  all the dimensions
[695.96 --> 696.62]  of shalom
[696.62 --> 697.82]  come with him
[697.82 --> 699.24]  for example
[699.24 --> 701.06]  when Jesus puts his hand
[701.06 --> 701.98]  over the stormy waters
[701.98 --> 702.94]  that are sloshing
[702.94 --> 703.66]  against the boats
[703.66 --> 704.40]  and wreaking havoc
[704.40 --> 705.70]  and that water goes flat
[705.70 --> 707.46]  Jesus brings peace
[707.46 --> 708.90]  to the creation
[708.90 --> 710.40]  he shows not only
[710.40 --> 711.52]  that he has the power of God
[711.52 --> 712.88]  to create that peace
[712.88 --> 714.12]  but he actually brings
[714.12 --> 714.62]  the shalom
[714.62 --> 715.78]  in his activity
[715.78 --> 717.62]  when Jesus casts out demons
[717.62 --> 718.68]  he doesn't just show
[718.68 --> 719.52]  his power over demons
[719.52 --> 720.60]  he brings peace
[720.60 --> 721.44]  to bodies
[721.44 --> 722.16]  and lives
[722.16 --> 722.66]  and minds
[722.66 --> 723.06]  and hearts
[723.06 --> 723.70]  tormented
[723.70 --> 725.00]  by demonic power
[725.00 --> 726.70]  when Jesus heals
[726.70 --> 727.84]  a sick child
[727.84 --> 728.86]  he shows
[728.86 --> 730.16]  that he can bring peace
[730.16 --> 730.98]  to bodies
[730.98 --> 732.28]  ravaged by disease
[732.28 --> 733.92]  when Jesus dines
[733.92 --> 734.84]  with tax collectors
[734.84 --> 735.72]  and outcasts
[735.72 --> 736.12]  and sinners
[736.12 --> 737.02]  the accusation
[737.02 --> 737.96]  that the Pharisees
[737.96 --> 738.52]  made of him
[738.52 --> 740.10]  he brings peace
[740.10 --> 741.82]  to divided communities
[741.82 --> 743.92]  peace to divided tables
[743.92 --> 746.56]  peace to divided ethnicities
[746.56 --> 748.52]  when Jesus teaches
[748.52 --> 749.08]  on the kingdom
[749.08 --> 750.02]  in the sermon on the mount
[750.02 --> 751.10]  his famous sort of collection
[751.10 --> 751.98]  of what it is
[751.98 --> 752.56]  that he's bringing
[752.56 --> 754.44]  he's showing the way
[754.44 --> 755.08]  of generosity
[755.08 --> 755.98]  of speaking
[755.98 --> 757.02]  of living in relationship
[757.02 --> 757.88]  of using our money
[757.88 --> 759.18]  that leads to life
[759.18 --> 760.34]  of peace
[760.34 --> 761.64]  and if you were here
[761.64 --> 762.14]  last Sunday
[762.14 --> 762.60]  you'll know
[762.60 --> 763.70]  that we talked about
[763.70 --> 764.46]  the way in which Jesus
[764.46 --> 765.90]  came to bring peace
[765.90 --> 766.84]  between us
[766.84 --> 767.48]  and our relationship
[767.48 --> 768.62]  with the Father
[768.62 --> 770.30]  he came to bring
[770.30 --> 771.60]  the very kind
[771.60 --> 772.70]  of holistic peace
[772.70 --> 774.34]  that Isaiah prophesied
[774.34 --> 775.60]  pushing back the darkness
[775.60 --> 776.74]  in every area of life
[776.74 --> 778.42]  and bringing the world
[778.42 --> 779.90]  back to the way
[779.90 --> 780.56]  it was created
[780.56 --> 781.44]  to be
[781.44 --> 783.30]  again
[783.30 --> 784.56]  Isaiah 9
[784.56 --> 785.50]  is an audacious
[785.50 --> 786.42]  claim
[786.42 --> 789.74]  how does that peace come
[789.74 --> 791.54]  I don't think anyone
[791.54 --> 792.12]  says it better
[792.12 --> 792.62]  than Paul
[792.62 --> 793.50]  in Colossians 1
[793.50 --> 794.38]  and I want to read this
[794.38 --> 794.68]  for us
[794.68 --> 795.22]  it should be up
[795.22 --> 795.94]  on the screen
[795.94 --> 797.76]  Paul writes
[797.76 --> 799.34]  for God was pleased
[799.34 --> 800.58]  to have all his fullness
[800.58 --> 801.26]  dwell in him
[801.26 --> 801.90]  that is Jesus
[801.90 --> 803.36]  and through him
[803.36 --> 804.96]  to reconcile to himself
[804.96 --> 805.94]  all things
[805.94 --> 807.30]  whether things in earth
[807.30 --> 808.34]  or things in heaven
[808.34 --> 811.08]  by making peace
[811.08 --> 812.62]  through his blood
[812.62 --> 814.06]  shed on the cross
[814.06 --> 816.08]  Jesus has come
[816.08 --> 818.28]  in the biggest possible sense
[818.28 --> 819.56]  to bring reconciliation
[819.56 --> 820.62]  to all the places
[820.62 --> 821.18]  of division
[821.18 --> 822.46]  the division between
[822.46 --> 823.50]  heaven and earth
[823.50 --> 824.70]  between God
[824.70 --> 825.92]  our holy loving Father
[825.92 --> 827.48]  and rebellious humanity
[827.48 --> 828.64]  he came to deal
[828.64 --> 829.20]  with the power
[829.20 --> 830.08]  that divides us
[830.08 --> 830.94]  from each other
[830.94 --> 832.24]  the world we live in
[832.24 --> 833.60]  and from ourselves
[833.60 --> 835.58]  he has come to bring
[835.58 --> 836.46]  that reconciliation
[836.46 --> 837.38]  and it came
[837.38 --> 839.10]  through the cross
[839.10 --> 840.70]  it came as Jesus
[840.70 --> 842.22]  willingly submitted himself
[842.22 --> 843.26]  to the plan of the Father
[843.26 --> 844.72]  he willingly gave himself
[844.72 --> 845.86]  up in his body
[845.86 --> 847.42]  to reconcile us
[847.42 --> 848.08]  to the Father
[848.08 --> 849.34]  to reconcile us
[849.34 --> 849.92]  to each other
[849.92 --> 852.12]  to bring peace
[852.12 --> 854.88]  and it doesn't come
[854.88 --> 856.92]  through a military war
[856.92 --> 858.34]  doesn't come
[858.34 --> 859.58]  through bringing swords
[859.58 --> 860.12]  and spears
[860.12 --> 861.08]  and building up an army
[861.08 --> 861.82]  which is what everyone
[861.82 --> 862.80]  was expecting of Jesus
[862.80 --> 864.74]  it's worth asking the question
[864.74 --> 865.42]  I talked about this
[865.42 --> 865.98]  in the 9 a.m.
[866.08 --> 867.30]  it's worth asking the question
[867.30 --> 868.18]  why in the world
[868.18 --> 869.22]  Peter had a sword
[869.22 --> 871.06]  when Jesus was praying
[871.06 --> 871.56]  in the garden
[871.56 --> 872.86]  and Jesus was arrested
[872.86 --> 873.86]  why does Peter
[873.86 --> 874.48]  have a sword
[874.48 --> 876.88]  because Peter
[876.88 --> 878.74]  like on the inner circle
[878.74 --> 879.26]  of Jesus
[879.26 --> 880.38]  thought that Jesus
[880.38 --> 880.94]  was starting
[880.94 --> 882.18]  a military revolution
[882.18 --> 884.02]  and Jesus looks at Peter
[884.02 --> 884.60]  who cuts off
[884.60 --> 885.76]  the high priest's ear
[885.76 --> 886.44]  and he heals
[886.44 --> 887.06]  the high priest's ear
[887.06 --> 888.64]  saying you've got this wrong
[888.64 --> 890.14]  and then Jesus
[890.14 --> 891.06]  goes to show Peter
[891.06 --> 892.06]  this is how I'm going
[892.06 --> 892.58]  to bring peace
[892.58 --> 893.34]  and it's giving up
[893.34 --> 894.04]  his life
[894.04 --> 895.72]  for the sake of the world
[895.72 --> 898.44]  there's a quote
[898.44 --> 899.54]  by Napoleon Bonaparte
[899.54 --> 900.70]  that I want to read for us
[900.70 --> 901.50]  if you don't know
[901.50 --> 901.92]  who that is
[901.92 --> 902.68]  he's a French emperor
[902.68 --> 904.52]  from 1805 to 1815
[904.52 --> 906.12]  the 51 years
[906.12 --> 907.40]  conquered 16 countries
[907.40 --> 908.38]  including the Netherlands
[908.38 --> 909.08]  single tier
[909.08 --> 910.96]  and Napoleon
[910.96 --> 911.54]  eventually
[911.54 --> 912.40]  was too aggressive
[912.40 --> 914.30]  he was too ambitious
[914.30 --> 916.26]  he finally lost a war
[916.26 --> 917.44]  and then he himself
[917.44 --> 918.34]  was banished to an island
[918.34 --> 918.80]  to die
[918.80 --> 919.84]  and before he died
[919.84 --> 920.42]  he is quoted
[920.42 --> 921.18]  to have said this
[921.18 --> 921.72]  and I want to read
[921.72 --> 922.30]  this quote for you
[922.30 --> 922.70]  because I think
[922.70 --> 923.56]  it's just stunning
[923.56 --> 924.94]  to hear from a military
[924.94 --> 926.74]  leader about Jesus
[926.74 --> 927.24]  he writes
[927.24 --> 927.90]  Alexander
[927.90 --> 929.04]  that is Alexander the Great
[929.04 --> 930.06]  Caesar
[930.06 --> 931.30]  Charlemagne
[931.30 --> 931.82]  and myself
[931.82 --> 933.36]  all founded empires
[933.36 --> 935.10]  but what foundation
[935.10 --> 936.46]  did we rest
[936.46 --> 937.14]  the creations
[937.14 --> 938.16]  of our genius
[938.16 --> 940.84]  upon force
[940.84 --> 942.86]  Jesus Christ
[942.86 --> 943.88]  founded an empire
[943.88 --> 944.74]  upon love
[944.74 --> 946.00]  and at this hour
[946.00 --> 947.02]  millions of men
[947.02 --> 947.50]  and women
[947.50 --> 948.16]  would die
[948.16 --> 949.00]  for him
[949.00 --> 951.54]  what a quote
[951.54 --> 952.82]  from someone
[952.82 --> 953.66]  who gave his life
[953.66 --> 954.52]  and ended up dying
[954.52 --> 956.20]  for his military campaign
[956.20 --> 957.60]  for the French Empire
[957.60 --> 958.18]  he says
[958.18 --> 958.88]  there's a different
[958.88 --> 959.42]  kind of kingdom
[959.42 --> 960.48]  established by a different
[960.48 --> 960.98]  kind of king
[960.98 --> 961.84]  who didn't do it
[961.84 --> 962.34]  with soldiers
[962.34 --> 963.14]  and boots on the ground
[963.14 --> 963.68]  he did it
[963.68 --> 964.98]  by giving up his life
[964.98 --> 966.40]  and that's the kingdom
[966.40 --> 968.42]  that will last forever
[968.42 --> 972.78]  but here's the question
[972.78 --> 973.56]  that I think
[973.56 --> 974.46]  at least a few of us
[974.46 --> 974.90]  are asking
[974.90 --> 976.62]  where in the world
[976.62 --> 977.60]  is that peace
[977.60 --> 978.52]  right
[978.52 --> 979.12]  early Christians
[979.12 --> 979.98]  asked the same question
[979.98 --> 980.70]  Jesus dies
[980.70 --> 981.68]  he rises from the dead
[981.68 --> 982.46]  he announces
[982.46 --> 983.30]  that the kingdom came
[983.30 --> 983.72]  and they're like
[983.72 --> 984.24]  okay
[984.24 --> 985.18]  but Caesar's still
[985.18 --> 985.72]  on the throne
[985.72 --> 986.72]  Roman military
[986.72 --> 987.88]  still occupy the streets
[987.88 --> 988.90]  lots of death
[988.90 --> 989.34]  and dying
[989.34 --> 989.80]  and disease
[989.80 --> 991.10]  where's the peace
[991.10 --> 992.70]  and I'd ask you
[992.70 --> 993.36]  how would you answer
[993.36 --> 993.90]  that question
[993.90 --> 995.46]  where's this
[995.46 --> 996.54]  everlasting peace
[996.54 --> 997.64]  brought by this prince
[997.64 --> 998.26]  right now
[998.26 --> 1000.58]  you know what
[1000.58 --> 1001.60]  early church apologists
[1001.60 --> 1002.36]  said to that answer
[1002.36 --> 1002.96]  to that question
[1002.96 --> 1004.92]  I love this answer
[1004.92 --> 1006.14]  as people were
[1006.14 --> 1006.86]  sort of challenging
[1006.86 --> 1007.42]  the faith
[1007.42 --> 1008.30]  what they believed
[1008.30 --> 1008.98]  how they knew
[1008.98 --> 1010.04]  the resurrection happened
[1010.04 --> 1010.94]  and what Jesus did
[1010.94 --> 1011.48]  was true
[1011.48 --> 1012.22]  they would say
[1012.22 --> 1014.72]  look at the church
[1014.72 --> 1017.28]  look at the people
[1017.28 --> 1018.24]  who by faith
[1018.24 --> 1018.96]  have taken hold
[1018.96 --> 1019.38]  of Jesus
[1019.38 --> 1020.12]  who have received
[1020.12 --> 1020.68]  his spirit
[1020.68 --> 1022.42]  they will show you
[1022.42 --> 1023.42]  the peace
[1023.42 --> 1025.36]  wouldn't that be
[1025.36 --> 1026.06]  a great defense
[1026.06 --> 1026.80]  of the faith today
[1026.80 --> 1027.80]  you don't know
[1027.80 --> 1028.20]  where the peace
[1028.20 --> 1028.74]  is in the world
[1028.74 --> 1029.68]  find the church
[1029.68 --> 1030.32]  there's where
[1030.32 --> 1030.70]  you're going to
[1030.70 --> 1031.32]  find the peace
[1031.32 --> 1033.14]  as early believers
[1033.14 --> 1033.94]  placed their hope
[1033.94 --> 1034.32]  in Jesus
[1034.32 --> 1035.32]  as they took hold
[1035.32 --> 1036.16]  of him by faith
[1036.16 --> 1036.98]  what was true
[1036.98 --> 1037.36]  for Jesus
[1037.36 --> 1038.36]  became true of them
[1038.36 --> 1039.52]  the peace Jesus
[1039.52 --> 1040.08]  had with his
[1040.08 --> 1040.54]  heavenly father
[1040.54 --> 1041.12]  became the peace
[1041.12 --> 1041.94]  they had
[1041.94 --> 1042.88]  with their heavenly father
[1042.88 --> 1043.86]  the peace Jesus
[1043.86 --> 1044.50]  had with those
[1044.50 --> 1044.88]  around him
[1044.88 --> 1045.58]  became the peace
[1045.58 --> 1046.40]  they had with
[1046.40 --> 1047.02]  those around him
[1047.02 --> 1047.96]  and on and on
[1047.96 --> 1048.54]  it went
[1048.54 --> 1050.28]  you look at Acts
[1050.28 --> 1050.70]  and what does it
[1050.70 --> 1051.10]  tell you
[1051.10 --> 1051.96]  it tells you
[1051.96 --> 1052.88]  a story of believers
[1052.88 --> 1054.10]  who experienced
[1054.10 --> 1055.40]  the reconciling power
[1055.40 --> 1056.28]  of Jesus' resurrection
[1056.28 --> 1057.38]  in real time
[1057.38 --> 1059.60]  it is no small miracle
[1059.60 --> 1061.30]  that Jews and Gentiles
[1061.30 --> 1062.74]  lived in family together
[1062.74 --> 1064.06]  that's a big deal
[1064.06 --> 1065.82]  it's no small miracle
[1065.82 --> 1067.26]  that wealthy and poor people
[1067.26 --> 1068.84]  sat around the table
[1068.84 --> 1070.18]  and maybe most significantly
[1070.18 --> 1071.20]  referred to one another
[1071.20 --> 1072.44]  not as wealthy and poor
[1072.44 --> 1073.10]  but as brothers
[1073.10 --> 1074.42]  and sisters
[1074.42 --> 1076.54]  it's no small miracle
[1076.54 --> 1078.74]  that slaves and slave owners
[1078.74 --> 1080.58]  took communion together
[1080.58 --> 1082.32]  whereas in other situations
[1082.32 --> 1083.46]  they would never be caught
[1083.46 --> 1085.44]  visibly near one another
[1085.44 --> 1087.70]  these are the boundary
[1087.70 --> 1089.26]  breaking moments
[1089.26 --> 1090.38]  of Jesus' peace
[1090.38 --> 1092.10]  coming alive
[1092.10 --> 1093.24]  in the life of the church
[1093.24 --> 1094.82]  that kingdom of peace
[1094.82 --> 1097.34]  starts in the church
[1097.34 --> 1099.08]  and church
[1099.08 --> 1099.72]  I have to say
[1099.72 --> 1100.74]  how beautiful it would be
[1100.74 --> 1101.58]  if people had questions
[1101.58 --> 1102.32]  about the resurrection
[1102.32 --> 1103.62]  questions about the identity
[1103.62 --> 1104.04]  of Jesus
[1104.04 --> 1104.80]  and you said
[1104.80 --> 1105.06]  hey
[1105.06 --> 1106.40]  come to our church
[1106.40 --> 1107.68]  you're going to taste
[1107.68 --> 1108.60]  peace
[1108.60 --> 1111.36]  I have a hunch
[1111.36 --> 1112.66]  you can confirm this
[1112.66 --> 1113.66]  in conversation today
[1113.66 --> 1114.60]  around the dinner table
[1114.60 --> 1116.32]  my hunch is
[1116.32 --> 1117.34]  a lot of people
[1117.34 --> 1118.04]  become Christians
[1118.04 --> 1119.48]  because they want
[1119.48 --> 1120.08]  that peace
[1120.08 --> 1121.70]  they become Christians
[1121.70 --> 1122.38]  and as they
[1122.38 --> 1123.56]  journey along
[1123.56 --> 1124.26]  in the Christian faith
[1124.26 --> 1125.06]  they themselves
[1125.06 --> 1126.44]  experience that peace
[1126.44 --> 1127.82]  coming into a marriage
[1127.82 --> 1128.54]  where there's conflict
[1128.54 --> 1129.32]  coming into a family
[1129.32 --> 1129.92]  where there's conflict
[1129.92 --> 1130.96]  coming into a workplace
[1130.96 --> 1131.46]  in a neighborhood
[1131.46 --> 1132.08]  where there's division
[1132.08 --> 1132.70]  of all kinds
[1132.70 --> 1133.14]  and they say
[1133.14 --> 1134.36]  Jesus is bringing
[1134.36 --> 1135.04]  in me
[1135.04 --> 1136.40]  shalom
[1136.40 --> 1138.46]  he's bringing
[1138.46 --> 1139.24]  his wholeness
[1139.24 --> 1140.14]  into my life
[1140.14 --> 1141.38]  and I see that wholeness
[1141.38 --> 1142.54]  moving from me
[1142.54 --> 1143.42]  into my spaces
[1143.42 --> 1145.04]  and places where I live
[1145.04 --> 1146.24]  I'm tasting his peace
[1146.24 --> 1147.00]  not in his fullness
[1147.00 --> 1147.66]  that's coming
[1147.66 --> 1149.20]  but it's broken in
[1149.20 --> 1150.16]  and the kingdom
[1150.16 --> 1151.14]  is showing up
[1151.14 --> 1152.26]  in the church
[1152.26 --> 1153.00]  is that true?
[1155.94 --> 1157.02]  a number of years ago
[1157.02 --> 1157.68]  when I was involved
[1157.68 --> 1158.98]  in international student ministry
[1158.98 --> 1159.80]  in my last church
[1159.80 --> 1161.30]  I remember having
[1161.30 --> 1162.06]  a number of students
[1162.06 --> 1162.80]  over to my place
[1162.80 --> 1163.32]  they were all students
[1163.32 --> 1163.96]  at SFU
[1163.96 --> 1164.96]  different places
[1164.96 --> 1165.52]  in their journey
[1165.52 --> 1166.28]  of understanding
[1166.28 --> 1167.52]  and believing in Jesus
[1167.52 --> 1168.98]  but we had a Christmas meal
[1168.98 --> 1169.54]  and we were sharing
[1169.54 --> 1170.30]  this meal together
[1170.30 --> 1171.50]  and three of them
[1171.50 --> 1172.20]  one was from Korea
[1172.20 --> 1173.04]  one was from Japan
[1173.04 --> 1174.10]  one was from China
[1174.10 --> 1175.46]  and we're eating together
[1175.46 --> 1176.36]  and the Korean student
[1176.36 --> 1176.82]  pipes up
[1176.82 --> 1177.08]  and he says
[1177.08 --> 1177.94]  this is so weird
[1177.94 --> 1179.90]  if I were back in Korea
[1179.90 --> 1180.94]  I'd never have a Japanese
[1180.94 --> 1181.94]  and a Chinese student
[1181.94 --> 1182.28]  in my home
[1182.28 --> 1182.90]  sharing a meal
[1182.90 --> 1184.54]  because there's history there
[1184.54 --> 1185.66]  there's geopolitical stuff
[1185.66 --> 1186.18]  in the past
[1186.18 --> 1186.76]  and their parents
[1186.76 --> 1187.94]  often had different views
[1187.94 --> 1188.50]  of one another
[1188.50 --> 1189.02]  as background
[1189.02 --> 1189.76]  and yet here
[1189.76 --> 1190.64]  these students were saying
[1190.64 --> 1191.78]  we're in your house
[1191.78 --> 1192.88]  and we're experiencing
[1192.88 --> 1193.60]  peace together
[1193.60 --> 1195.26]  as one another
[1195.26 --> 1195.90]  in this house
[1195.90 --> 1197.16]  and what I was hearing him say
[1197.16 --> 1198.70]  is this is what happens
[1198.70 --> 1200.16]  as we come into the church
[1200.16 --> 1200.74]  as we taste
[1200.74 --> 1201.78]  what Jesus is about
[1201.78 --> 1203.34]  we begin to experience
[1203.34 --> 1204.60]  that reconciling peace
[1204.60 --> 1206.26]  between one another
[1206.26 --> 1210.18]  and it shouldn't surprise us
[1210.18 --> 1211.48]  that in the beginning
[1211.48 --> 1212.22]  of Jesus' teaching
[1212.22 --> 1213.12]  on the Sermon on the Mount
[1213.12 --> 1214.38]  what's one of the blessings
[1214.38 --> 1215.38]  he says at the outset
[1215.38 --> 1218.04]  he gives a series of blessings
[1218.04 --> 1218.92]  called the Beatitudes
[1218.92 --> 1220.06]  what's one of the first ones
[1220.06 --> 1220.64]  Jesus says
[1220.64 --> 1223.44]  blessed are the peacemakers
[1223.44 --> 1224.42]  what's the next part
[1224.42 --> 1226.12]  for they will be called
[1226.12 --> 1228.54]  children of God
[1228.54 --> 1229.90]  what a statement
[1229.90 --> 1230.66]  that is to say
[1230.66 --> 1231.40]  blessed are those
[1231.40 --> 1232.20]  who live shalom
[1232.20 --> 1233.30]  who make shalom
[1233.30 --> 1234.08]  who bring peace
[1234.08 --> 1234.52]  into their lives
[1234.52 --> 1235.96]  they are reflecting
[1235.96 --> 1237.30]  the peacemaking heart
[1237.30 --> 1237.82]  of the Father
[1237.82 --> 1238.64]  who has come
[1238.64 --> 1239.24]  and made peace
[1239.24 --> 1239.70]  with the world
[1239.70 --> 1240.70]  through the work of Jesus
[1240.70 --> 1243.76]  we become like Jesus
[1243.76 --> 1245.80]  when we make peace
[1245.80 --> 1248.42]  we reflect the shalom
[1248.42 --> 1248.98]  of Jesus
[1248.98 --> 1250.18]  when we live
[1250.18 --> 1250.96]  as peacemakers
[1250.96 --> 1251.82]  in our workplaces
[1251.82 --> 1253.04]  in our families
[1253.04 --> 1254.06]  on the soccer team
[1254.06 --> 1255.00]  in our households
[1255.00 --> 1255.54]  and neighborhoods
[1255.54 --> 1257.90]  and I think it's worth
[1257.90 --> 1258.68]  asking the question
[1258.68 --> 1259.94]  as you approach
[1259.94 --> 1260.74]  your family meal
[1260.74 --> 1261.36]  this Christmas
[1261.36 --> 1262.22]  or you sit down
[1262.22 --> 1262.60]  with people
[1262.60 --> 1263.58]  who maybe you are
[1263.58 --> 1264.28]  not at peace with
[1264.28 --> 1266.16]  what might Christ call
[1266.16 --> 1267.68]  to be those
[1267.68 --> 1269.18]  who embody God's shalom
[1269.18 --> 1270.90]  and be peacemakers
[1270.90 --> 1271.34]  be
[1271.34 --> 1272.66]  for you
[1272.66 --> 1273.58]  as you sit beside
[1273.58 --> 1274.10]  that uncle
[1274.10 --> 1275.36]  who's got those
[1275.36 --> 1276.76]  crazy political views
[1276.76 --> 1277.78]  who by the way
[1277.78 --> 1278.52]  thinks that you have
[1278.52 --> 1279.86]  those crazy political views
[1279.86 --> 1281.52]  or that relative
[1281.52 --> 1282.32]  that you have a hard time
[1282.32 --> 1282.94]  speaking with
[1282.94 --> 1283.72]  sharing meals with
[1283.72 --> 1285.12]  and don't have much love for
[1285.12 --> 1286.74]  what might peacemaking
[1286.74 --> 1287.40]  look like
[1287.40 --> 1288.94]  embodying the shalom
[1288.94 --> 1289.76]  of God look like
[1289.76 --> 1291.64]  in the next few days
[1291.64 --> 1294.78]  and perhaps
[1294.78 --> 1295.82]  an equally important
[1295.82 --> 1296.82]  question for me is
[1296.82 --> 1297.54]  or at least something
[1297.54 --> 1298.18]  I've been percolating
[1298.18 --> 1298.74]  on this week
[1298.74 --> 1300.52]  what if peacemaking
[1300.52 --> 1302.12]  and living out
[1302.12 --> 1302.56]  that shalom
[1302.56 --> 1303.42]  is exactly
[1303.42 --> 1304.76]  what we need to be doing
[1304.76 --> 1305.46]  as people who are
[1305.46 --> 1306.76]  waiting for Jesus' return
[1306.76 --> 1308.54]  what if peacemaking
[1308.54 --> 1309.14]  was the way
[1309.14 --> 1309.90]  that we lived
[1309.90 --> 1310.98]  our current hope
[1310.98 --> 1312.26]  for Jesus our King
[1312.26 --> 1313.16]  to come and make
[1313.16 --> 1314.06]  that kingdom of peace
[1314.06 --> 1314.80]  full
[1314.80 --> 1316.48]  around this whole world
[1316.48 --> 1318.12]  you know this week
[1318.12 --> 1318.80]  I was reading an article
[1318.80 --> 1319.54]  by Scott Jose
[1319.54 --> 1321.00]  and there was an article
[1321.00 --> 1321.48]  on Advent
[1321.48 --> 1321.94]  and he said
[1321.94 --> 1322.84]  what exactly does it
[1322.84 --> 1324.00]  look like to wait
[1324.00 --> 1325.48]  like how are we supposed
[1325.48 --> 1326.22]  to wait for Jesus
[1326.22 --> 1326.94]  to come back
[1326.94 --> 1328.02]  what is it that we're
[1328.02 --> 1328.64]  supposed to be busy
[1328.64 --> 1329.76]  doing while Jesus
[1329.76 --> 1330.26]  comes back
[1330.26 --> 1330.72]  and he's got this
[1330.72 --> 1331.32]  little paragraph
[1331.32 --> 1332.20]  I'm like yes
[1332.20 --> 1334.04]  this captures peacemaking
[1334.04 --> 1334.90]  he writes
[1334.90 --> 1336.90]  can it be possible
[1336.90 --> 1338.32]  that being faithful
[1338.32 --> 1339.06]  to our Lord
[1339.06 --> 1341.30]  in everyday routines
[1341.30 --> 1344.22]  demonstrates holy watchfulness
[1344.22 --> 1345.18]  for his return
[1345.18 --> 1346.42]  did you catch the question
[1346.42 --> 1349.52]  is it being an honest office manager
[1349.52 --> 1352.02]  a careful school bus driver
[1352.02 --> 1354.00]  an ethical attorney
[1354.00 --> 1355.80]  a thoughtful housewife
[1355.80 --> 1356.60]  or husband
[1356.60 --> 1358.34]  is that really a sign
[1358.34 --> 1359.34]  that we are aware
[1359.34 --> 1361.16]  and ready for Jesus' return
[1361.16 --> 1362.84]  and the answer Scott gives
[1362.84 --> 1364.42]  is absolutely
[1364.42 --> 1367.52]  those ordinary routines
[1367.52 --> 1369.24]  where we seek to live
[1369.24 --> 1370.22]  as peacemakers
[1370.22 --> 1371.24]  in our workplace
[1371.24 --> 1372.64]  driving the bus
[1372.64 --> 1373.76]  with our kids
[1373.76 --> 1373.78]  with our kids
[1373.78 --> 1374.58]  in our neighborhood
[1374.58 --> 1375.64]  as we seek to live
[1375.64 --> 1376.78]  the shalom of Jesus
[1376.78 --> 1378.86]  we are showing the world
[1378.86 --> 1379.54]  what the world
[1379.54 --> 1381.10]  not only to be created for
[1381.10 --> 1382.00]  but how the world
[1382.00 --> 1383.66]  will be upon Jesus' return
[1383.66 --> 1386.54]  what I'm convinced of
[1386.54 --> 1387.96]  is that the fullness
[1387.96 --> 1389.12]  of what this prophecy
[1389.12 --> 1390.34]  in Isaiah 9 is about
[1390.34 --> 1391.58]  will be experienced
[1391.58 --> 1392.12]  not yet
[1392.12 --> 1393.22]  but when Jesus returns
[1393.22 --> 1395.10]  but I want us to hear
[1395.10 --> 1395.60]  this morning
[1395.60 --> 1396.40]  that the peace
[1396.40 --> 1397.52]  has come
[1397.52 --> 1398.42]  the kingdom
[1398.42 --> 1399.84]  that Jesus has brought
[1399.84 --> 1400.70]  is here to stay
[1400.70 --> 1402.34]  and the peace starts
[1402.34 --> 1404.06]  right here
[1404.06 --> 1405.54]  community of people
[1405.54 --> 1406.28]  who follow Jesus
[1406.28 --> 1407.40]  the peace starts
[1407.40 --> 1408.66]  right in our relationships
[1408.66 --> 1409.98]  right in our marriages
[1409.98 --> 1411.22]  right in our neighborhoods
[1411.22 --> 1412.42]  and through us
[1412.42 --> 1413.86]  we demonstrate
[1413.86 --> 1415.36]  the reconciling
[1415.36 --> 1416.94]  love of Jesus Christ
[1416.94 --> 1418.04]  for his world
