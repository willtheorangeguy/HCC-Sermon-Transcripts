[0.00 → 5.42] Well, it is a privilege that we get to gather around the scriptures this morning and we
[5.42 → 7.50] get to hear God speak to us through the book of James.
[8.42 → 12.56] We've been working our way through this book for the last few weeks now, and I trust that
[12.56 → 16.86] it's moving its way into your homes, to your tables, and I know a number of small groups
[16.86 → 20.64] just launched, and I'm thankful for the way that this conversation goes into our homes
[20.64 → 24.46] and our small group meetings because James is the kind of book that's so full of wisdom
[24.46 → 28.88] that we want it to percolate and to marinate in our imaginations and shape the way we actually
[28.88 → 29.40] live.
[30.00 → 31.56] So we're going to continue in that series.
[31.66 → 33.96] If you have your Bible, turn with me to James chapter 1.
[34.48 → 37.92] I'm going to read starting in verse 19 on listening and doing.
[42.26 → 47.24] My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this.
[48.00 → 54.62] Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry because our
[54.62 → 57.68] anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.
[57.68 → 64.44] Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept
[64.44 → 67.72] the word planted in you which can save you.
[68.56 → 71.76] Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves.
[72.30 → 73.52] Do what it says.
[74.20 → 77.66] Those who listen to the word but do not do what it says are like people who look at their
[77.66 → 82.94] faces in a mirror and after looking at themselves go away and immediately forget what they look
[82.94 → 83.30] like.
[84.02 → 88.50] But those who look intently into the perfect law that gives freedom and continue in it,
[88.66 → 93.22] not forgetting what they've heard but doing it, they'll be blessed in what they do.
[93.22 → 99.08] Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive
[99.08 → 101.56] themselves and their religion is worthless.
[102.66 → 107.50] Religion that our God, our Father, accepts as pure and faultless is this, to look after
[107.50 → 113.68] orphans and widows in their distress and keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
[113.68 → 123.02] Well, I want to begin this morning with a story about a young pastor who starts his ministry
[123.02 → 127.20] in a congregation that has been established for a while, and he quickly learns after a short
[127.20 → 129.50] while that there is some serious conflict in the church.
[130.14 → 132.60] In fact, there are two factions of people in the church.
[132.88 → 137.70] One of those factions has people who say to the pastor, the tradition of the church is
[137.70 → 140.18] to pray sitting down during the service.
[140.18 → 145.38] The other faction insists that the tradition of the church is that they pray standing up
[145.38 → 146.84] while they worship in the service.
[147.94 → 151.82] And the pastor assumes that, hey, we can solve this one, and so he has conversations and tries
[151.82 → 155.44] to mediate and works and mediate and work, but it just creates a deeper division.
[155.60 → 158.98] People dig in their heels, and they're getting angry with one another, these two groups.
[159.68 → 163.08] And eventually he's brought to the point where he says, I need to meet the pastor who used
[163.08 → 164.70] to pastor at this church and is now retired.
[164.94 → 166.28] He's going to help me solve this.
[166.68 → 170.04] So he goes to that retired pastor, sits down with him, and he says, look.
[170.18 → 171.12] I'm going to bind here.
[171.34 → 175.76] There's real conflict in the church and I need to know, is it the tradition of the church
[175.76 → 177.32] that we sit while we pray?
[178.38 → 180.68] And the pastor says to him, no, that's not the tradition.
[181.62 → 184.90] He says, well, therefore, the tradition of the church must then be that we stand while
[184.90 → 185.30] we pray.
[186.46 → 188.76] The pastor says, no, that's not the tradition of the church.
[189.58 → 191.04] And then the young pastor got frustrated.
[191.14 → 192.10] He throws up his arms.
[192.18 → 193.18] He says, well, what gives?
[193.18 → 195.14] Because right now I've got two factions of people.
[195.32 → 198.44] They're all shouting at each other saying they know what's best about how to pray in the
[198.44 → 199.98] church and no one's getting along.
[200.76 → 204.72] And the pastor looked at him and says, ah, that's the tradition of our church.
[207.28 → 208.46] Now we laugh, right?
[208.56 → 210.52] It's a story that's meant to open up.
[210.78 → 214.42] It's the propensity of the church to fall into conflict, to be sharp with one another,
[214.60 → 219.48] to have anger and resentment rather than to humbly accept God's word and do his will
[219.48 → 219.94] together.
[219.94 → 226.32] And the book of James this morning has some very deep wisdom for how we are to live with
[226.32 → 231.80] one another, how we are to speak with one another, and what the kind of religion that
[231.80 → 233.92] God the Father invites us into as Christians.
[234.86 → 239.56] Here are the three specific ways, three specific pieces of wisdom that James gives in this passage.
[239.72 → 243.08] Number one, how to speak and how we listen.
[243.08 → 248.50] Number two, listening means doing, not just hearing.
[248.68 → 250.00] That's verse 22 to 25.
[250.84 → 253.70] And finally, doing means serving the needs of the city.
[253.80 → 256.24] That is caring for the widows and the orphans.
[256.30 → 258.16] And we're going to look at all three of those this morning.
[259.06 → 260.54] So let's look at the first one first.
[260.70 → 262.22] How we speak and how we listen.
[262.32 → 265.54] I'm just going to be brief on this one because Pastor Sid is touching on this in two weeks'
[265.62 → 265.72] time.
[265.80 → 269.56] In fact, all the things that show up in chapter one show up throughout the book.
[270.16 → 272.94] But you should know that Pastor Sid is preaching on this in two weeks, and we all have a good
[272.94 → 277.52] laugh because on our preaching calendar, it says, October 16, Sid, watch your mouth.
[278.08 → 279.16] Because he's preaching on the tongue.
[279.52 → 282.62] So as staff, we say, well, Sid, you better watch your mouth when you preach on taming
[282.62 → 283.04] the tongue.
[284.50 → 289.28] But this is what James says, my dear brothers and sisters, take note of this.
[289.52 → 295.76] Everyone, everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry.
[296.20 → 299.12] Because our anger does not produce the righteousness.
[299.56 → 301.34] That God desires.
[302.80 → 303.84] How's that going for you?
[305.48 → 306.86] Easier said than done, isn't it?
[307.92 → 312.32] The assumption James makes, this is true throughout the book, that there used to be a way that
[312.32 → 314.72] people in the church would relate to each other.
[314.82 → 316.00] There's a way they used to speak.
[316.08 → 319.88] There's a way that was normal for their lives, but that's now different as they follow Jesus.
[320.58 → 324.24] What's normal around them, what's normal in their former community of faith is not the
[324.24 → 325.36] same now that they follow Jesus.
[325.36 → 330.08] Now they put away the old ways of speaking, the old ways of responding in conflict, and
[330.08 → 331.80] the old ways of retaliating even.
[332.16 → 338.12] And there's a new conduct shaped by the way of Jesus that must be visible in the church.
[338.80 → 343.90] And that is quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to become angry.
[344.60 → 346.46] And I ask again, how's that going for you?
[346.46 → 351.80] Every time I look at that passage, it reminds me of a specific story.
[352.54 → 356.48] A few years ago, I was involved in, you know, a significant situation involving conflict.
[356.60 → 358.08] And there's a number of people in this conversation.
[358.18 → 359.30] It was a heated conversation.
[360.34 → 362.64] And as we went through, and I thought it was actually kind of healthy.
[362.74 → 364.44] People spoke their real hearts, which is important.
[364.90 → 367.66] But afterwards, someone leaned to me and said something that I needed to hear.
[367.74 → 371.30] They said, you know, I learned a lot about the other person in this conversation.
[371.30 → 396.98] And I'm convinced that if it is the case that we as followers of Jesus want to navigate
[396.98 → 400.84] relationships wisely, and remember James is giving wisdom on how to live well.
[400.84 → 406.08] If we want to live wisely in relationships, we will need to learn how to be slow to speak,
[406.82 → 409.74] quick to listen, and understand.
[410.02 → 414.96] We'll move from assumptions that lead to accusations about other people to questions that lead to
[414.96 → 416.22] curiosity and understanding.
[417.78 → 420.10] Sid will talk more about this in a couple of weeks' time.
[421.20 → 423.48] But notice that it's not just about speaking and listening.
[423.70 → 425.56] It's about being slow to be angry.
[426.54 → 430.70] That's perhaps maybe the harder one, especially when you're in conversations that are not easy
[430.70 → 434.80] for you with conflict with family members and close friends who aren't seeing eye to eye
[434.80 → 435.30] with you.
[436.02 → 439.60] And James, at least according to some writers, is not just addressing the everyday frustration
[439.60 → 442.98] and anger you might have with a difficult task at work or a challenging child at home.
[443.26 → 447.54] He's actually speaking to disruptive, explosive, community-dividing leaders.
[448.54 → 452.68] People who, when they lead in the church, elders, deacons, or pastors, cannot control their anger
[452.68 → 455.10] and therefore are creating division in the body of Christ.
[455.10 → 460.62] And James is saying, if it is to be Jesus you're following, as leaders and as a church,
[460.72 → 465.52] you must reflect His forbearance, His restraint, and His patience.
[466.82 → 468.16] How's that going for you?
[469.90 → 474.62] Quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry.
[474.70 → 478.66] And this is definitely related to putting away the moral filth, putting away the old self,
[478.76 → 480.66] and putting on the character of Christ.
[480.66 → 486.08] This is what it means to join the community that's learning together how to practice what
[486.08 → 488.02] Jesus modelled for the church.
[488.12 → 490.58] And James is, again, very on the ground.
[490.72 → 494.22] He wants very practical wisdom to be received and lived by the church.
[495.04 → 496.42] And that brings us to the second point.
[496.48 → 499.26] He talks about receiving the Word of God humbly, which can save them.
[499.62 → 504.96] And then he says in verse 22, do not merely listen to the Word, and so deceive yourselves.
[505.58 → 506.64] Do what it says.
[506.64 → 510.26] Anyone who listens to the Word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks
[510.26 → 514.74] at their face in a mirror, and after looking at himself goes away and immediately forgets
[514.74 → 515.68] what he looks like.
[516.30 → 519.30] And this goes back to like a big concern of James throughout the book, right?
[519.70 → 523.88] Faith that leads to action, leaf that leads to practice, listening that leads to doing.
[525.42 → 528.94] And he's got a fascinating image there that there's actually different takes on of
[528.94 → 531.30] the person who looks at themselves in a mirror and then forgets.
[531.52 → 535.14] Now, I bet you in its original context everyone got that, but there's actually three different
[535.14 → 535.96] ways you can interpret it.
[535.96 → 537.68] I'm just going to give you what I think is the most likely.
[538.00 → 539.42] If you disagree, look it up in the commentaries.
[539.54 → 540.84] You can just say what you think.
[541.42 → 544.64] But it's probably the fact, first, mirrors are not common in the first century.
[544.96 → 547.36] They didn't have all the glass that we have in our homes or even phones that you could
[547.36 → 550.52] just turn around on yourself, like people do on the bus all the time.
[551.42 → 554.68] They would have to piece of polished metal probably, and you look at yourself in a mirror
[554.68 → 555.56] not that frequently.
[555.76 → 559.02] And perhaps it was the case that if you saw yourself in the mirror, you'd notice, hey, your hair
[559.02 → 560.82] is kind of a mess or there's dirt on your face.
[560.92 → 564.32] And you'd feel compelled after looking at yourself in the mirror to do something about it.
[564.32 → 569.62] And James is then saying someone who hears the scriptures, who engages the word and then
[569.62 → 573.10] goes away and does nothing about it is like someone who sees dirt on their face in the
[573.10 → 576.78] mirror and never even does anything to get the dirt off their face.
[577.48 → 578.64] And this point is so clear.
[578.78 → 579.44] It's useless.
[580.14 → 584.02] It is useless to read the scriptures and to not do what they're asking you to do.
[584.08 → 590.02] It's useless to sort of spend time in this word as just information gathering, as just
[590.02 → 590.68] understanding.
[590.68 → 595.78] I mean, to put it a different way, to know where a verse comes from in the Bible and not
[595.78 → 597.80] know how to live it is not helpful, right?
[598.16 → 602.44] To have a whole book of the Bible memorized and be so proud of yourself but not interested
[602.44 → 606.28] in allowing God to shape your character and you're becoming and your behaviour from that
[606.28 → 607.62] book is not helpful.
[608.52 → 610.22] And James is saying it's not just useless.
[610.34 → 612.94] It's not just part of what he calls in chapter 2 dead faith.
[613.24 → 614.38] It's actually dangerous.
[614.38 → 617.04] And you notice the language he uses there.
[617.12 → 621.16] Someone who doesn't do what they hear in the word, it deceives themselves.
[622.06 → 623.32] That word shows up a few times in our passage.
[623.44 → 624.32] He deceives himself.
[624.80 → 628.78] And that is to say they are deceived about what it means to follow the Lord.
[629.12 → 631.50] They're deceived about what their faith is actually all about.
[631.72 → 633.60] They think it's fine just to collect information.
[634.26 → 637.66] They think it's fine just to know things or graze the words and not allow it to shape the
[637.66 → 638.12] way they live.
[638.38 → 641.32] And James is saying that's not what the faith is.
[641.32 → 643.68] And you might think it's fine with the Lord.
[643.76 → 647.00] You might have a construction of the Christian faith that is about knowledge and information
[647.00 → 648.72] and that is not what he's after.
[650.54 → 654.80] And I don't know how that sits with you, but I find it challenging because my whole life
[654.80 → 657.02] I've grown up in an information heavy tradition.
[658.10 → 661.52] The Reformed church that I grew up in was big on doctrine and theology, and I'm so grateful
[661.52 → 662.00] for it.
[662.12 → 664.20] I'm grateful for the catechism classes I attended.
[664.38 → 668.90] But so often you can have this massive chasm between all the information you're taking in
[668.90 → 670.58] and seeking to live it.
[670.58 → 673.08] And James is just pounding on that drum.
[673.64 → 677.60] Are you allowing what you hear and listen to shape your behaviour and your becoming?
[678.22 → 682.92] Because if it isn't, it's a dead faith and it's a useless listening.
[684.12 → 688.80] Again I say as I've said throughout this series, these are strong words, they're hard words,
[688.86 → 689.78] they're challenging words.
[690.16 → 692.02] But man are they wise words.
[692.02 → 698.06] And I'm learning also that James is not saying anything novel here.
[698.76 → 702.24] This is true of the Old Testament wisdom literature, but it's also true of the teaching of Jesus.
[702.38 → 707.22] In fact, most writers connect this teaching to Jesus' own words in Matthew 7 where he says,
[707.26 → 709.34] and you'll probably know this story even if you're new to the church,
[709.78 → 710.34] Jesus says,
[710.34 → 717.32] You know what he says?
[718.32 → 719.36] He's like the fool.
[720.62 → 724.02] The fool who builds a house not on stone but on sand.
[724.78 → 727.58] The person who hears but not does is someone who builds a house on sand.
[727.58 → 730.66] And as the wind comes, the waves come, that house is going to crash.
[731.26 → 734.80] And again, Jesus himself gives a strong image for someone who doesn't think it matters
[734.80 → 737.20] to live that which they hear in the scriptures.
[738.12 → 738.84] It's a strong word.
[739.24 → 739.96] Not from James.
[740.66 → 741.20] From Jesus.
[746.76 → 749.66] But not just giving a warning, James also gives some positive encouragement.
[749.78 → 751.80] I actually really love what James says in verse 25.
[752.66 → 752.94] He says,
[752.94 → 754.06] This is positive now.
[754.06 → 758.10] Whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom and continues in it,
[758.18 → 759.96] not forgetting what they have heard but doing it,
[760.34 → 763.00] they'll be blessed in what they do.
[763.66 → 765.10] That's positive encouragement.
[765.48 → 769.00] And I love, by the way, the way James speaks of the Old Testament.
[769.96 → 771.80] You know if I'm understanding studies correctly,
[771.92 → 774.04] most people don't read, most Christians don't read the Old Testament.
[774.18 → 778.08] They have a sense of it being old, unnecessary, outdated, restrictive, all the rest.
[778.08 → 780.38] And James says it gives life.
[781.54 → 783.18] It leads to the way we're supposed to live.
[783.18 → 787.82] It's sort of God's design for creation in certain instructions that help us navigate life well.
[788.56 → 792.00] And his assumption isn't that it's like restrictive or make life difficult
[792.00 → 793.60] or just expose how bad you are.
[793.66 → 796.12] It's like if you follow this, it's going to lead to life.
[796.84 → 799.12] And James assumes, like other New Testament writers,
[799.36 → 802.24] that the good news in Jesus, this is such an important teaching,
[802.70 → 804.24] is not that he gets rid of the Old Testament.
[804.98 → 808.46] It's that Jesus gives you the heart that seeks to obey the good instruction of it.
[809.32 → 810.56] Jesus doesn't change the word.
[810.56 → 811.78] He says that in the Sermon on the Mount.
[811.78 → 812.72] He changes you.
[813.22 → 813.80] He changes me.
[813.88 → 815.92] He takes that heart of stone and gives us a heart of flesh.
[816.22 → 819.76] Takes a heart that wants to rebel and gives us a heart that wants to change and follow.
[820.46 → 824.44] And the good news for James is because Jesus has risen from the dead and ascended to heaven,
[824.84 → 826.76] you now can follow this good instruction.
[827.76 → 832.58] You can read the word and by the spirit of God respond in faith and action.
[833.54 → 834.40] That's good news.
[834.40 → 839.30] And it brings us then to the action of the third piece of wisdom
[839.30 → 842.36] on what the kind of religion God wants from the church.
[843.26 → 844.04] Verse 26.
[845.12 → 846.76] Those who consider themselves religious
[846.76 → 850.64] and do not keep a tight rein on their tongue deceives themselves.
[850.74 → 851.44] See that word again.
[851.86 → 853.18] And their religion is worthless.
[854.12 → 857.44] Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and flawless is this,
[857.44 → 863.56] to look after orphans and widows in distress and keep oneself from being polluted by this world.
[864.54 → 866.92] So what kind of religion is the Father after?
[867.42 → 871.62] It's not a religion defined by people who are quick to speak and slow to listen.
[871.62 → 874.40] People who are fired up in anger when they reach conflict
[874.40 → 876.30] or people who are listening but not doing.
[876.40 → 879.50] The kind of religion that James says the heart of the Father is after
[879.50 → 883.54] is one where you're resisting the polluting influence of the world
[883.54 → 887.62] and meeting the concrete needs of the city with love and care.
[888.82 → 889.46] What do you think?
[890.34 → 891.26] That's how he puts it.
[892.32 → 894.68] The religion that the Father is interested in,
[894.90 → 896.14] seeing lived in the church,
[896.58 → 898.42] is body of Christ coming around and saying,
[898.60 → 900.34] here are the needs of the city, we're going to meet them.
[900.34 → 904.08] And you should know that, again, James is not speaking anything new.
[904.16 → 905.38] He's taking the Old Testament teaching
[905.38 → 907.20] and he's taking the teaching of Jesus
[907.20 → 908.84] and fusing it together for the church.
[909.18 → 910.04] Just two quotes.
[910.12 → 912.06] And I could pick tons from the Old Testament on this.
[912.38 → 914.68] But here's what we read in Deuteronomy 10, verse 18.
[916.02 → 919.02] He, that is God, defends the cause of the fatherless,
[919.08 → 920.86] that's the orphan, and the widow.
[921.56 → 924.70] He loves the foreigner residing among you and gives him food and clothing.
[925.34 → 927.78] And you, therefore, are to love those who are foreigners
[927.78 → 930.12] as you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt.
[931.04 → 933.96] And now Jesus is in a very strong teaching on Matthew 25,
[934.04 → 936.12] where he identifies with the marginalized.
[936.38 → 939.20] He says, I needed clothes, and you gave them to me.
[939.42 → 941.34] I was sick, and you took care of me.
[941.60 → 944.58] I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
[945.70 → 948.40] And you need to know that the early church,
[948.80 → 950.70] when they heard the instruction from Jesus and Matthew
[950.70 → 952.66] or Deuteronomy or James,
[952.98 → 954.58] they took it very seriously.
[954.98 → 957.14] It wasn't just like, hey, caring for the widows and the orphans
[957.14 → 959.34] sounds like important things that we might want to try.
[959.94 → 963.30] They responded and said, okay, those are the two great needs in our city,
[963.68 → 966.44] because orphans, often the way it worked in the first century,
[966.58 → 968.38] and Sid talked about this just a few weeks ago,
[968.42 → 969.94] is that if you didn't want your baby,
[970.00 → 971.98] you just leave your baby outside until it died.
[972.72 → 974.92] And oftentimes it was the girls who would be left outside
[974.92 → 976.62] because families wanted the boys and the lineage
[976.62 → 978.08] and a number of things like that.
[978.46 → 980.10] And the church then said, there's a need.
[980.24 → 981.32] We'll take those children in.
[982.24 → 983.32] Same is true of widows.
[983.64 → 985.94] If a man passed away and an older woman was by herself,
[986.02 → 988.38] she would be destitute because he was the one who was making money
[988.38 → 990.28] and she wouldn't have the funds to support herself.
[990.36 → 992.36] And the church would say, hey, there's a critical need.
[992.42 → 993.52] We'll take them into our church.
[994.02 → 995.32] We'll be the family for the widow.
[995.42 → 996.48] We'll be the family for the orphan.
[996.62 → 998.40] And we'll do what needs to be done
[998.40 → 1000.68] to reflect the love of Jesus for the margins
[1000.68 → 1003.04] in this community right here in the city.
[1005.26 → 1006.88] I read a book not that long ago,
[1006.88 → 1008.36] and I commend it to you if you're a reader.
[1008.58 → 1011.00] It's called The Patient Ferment of the Early Church.
[1011.32 → 1012.94] It's by a writer named Alan Rider,
[1013.38 → 1016.66] and he collects so much information on the early church,
[1016.76 → 1018.36] so many things written by early Christians
[1018.36 → 1021.20] and written by other people about the early Christians.
[1021.88 → 1023.44] And I was struck by one of the criticisms.
[1023.80 → 1025.76] This is a criticism written by someone, not a believer,
[1026.08 → 1027.52] who is observing the church.
[1027.98 → 1030.10] And he was seeing the widows and the orphans in the church,
[1030.14 → 1030.94] and this is what he wrote.
[1030.98 → 1033.82] He says, they have in their midst our old women
[1034.06 → 1036.70] whom we despised and our children too.
[1037.90 → 1038.70] Think about that.
[1039.28 → 1041.14] This is the person who is noticing the life of the church
[1041.14 → 1042.62] and he noticed in that community
[1042.62 → 1044.92] were the people they didn't care for in the city.
[1045.42 → 1046.28] Could you imagine that?
[1046.62 → 1048.68] It's like, how dare they take these needs of our city?
[1048.74 → 1049.76] How dare they concern themselves?
[1049.84 → 1051.24] They have our old women who we despise
[1051.24 → 1053.20] and the children we neglected as well.
[1053.36 → 1054.22] That was his criticism.
[1055.20 → 1057.78] Lord, may it be so that that is the criticism of our church.
[1059.34 → 1061.46] Tertullian, second century leader in the church,
[1062.00 → 1063.88] he actually said that this was a point
[1063.88 → 1065.12] of encouragement in the city.
[1065.24 → 1067.04] He noticed that the care they're showing towards
[1067.04 → 1068.42] that marginalized, the widows, and the orphan
[1068.42 → 1069.86] was actually growing the church.
[1069.86 → 1071.24] And people would look in the church,
[1071.32 → 1074.04] see all these outsiders becoming the insiders,
[1074.24 → 1075.78] the marginalized becoming family,
[1076.12 → 1078.46] the people with no power being given dignity and love.
[1078.70 → 1080.16] He would say when people saw that,
[1080.22 → 1081.22] they would say, and he quotes,
[1081.62 → 1083.94] look at how they love each other.
[1085.06 → 1088.30] Again, may it be said that people who visit Hope
[1088.30 → 1090.48] spend time in this community say,
[1090.64 → 1094.48] wow, look at how they love each other.
[1094.48 → 1097.68] And it's no coincidence that we had the interview
[1097.68 → 1099.62] with Carrie Hamlin this morning on foster care
[1099.62 → 1101.50] because that's just one way that we show
[1101.50 → 1105.04] the very concrete love of Jesus to needs in our city.
[1105.84 → 1107.52] In fact, I'll share a story about foster care
[1107.52 → 1108.72] that some of you may have heard before.
[1108.78 → 1109.56] I shared it a few years ago.
[1110.22 → 1111.88] But there were a couple pastors in Phoenix
[1111.88 → 1114.56] who were made aware of a need in the city
[1114.56 → 1115.90] by some people they're connected to
[1115.90 → 1118.00] and that they had a foster care crisis.
[1118.10 → 1119.62] That is, they had so many children
[1119.62 → 1120.92] who had no families to go to
[1120.92 → 1122.58] as the families were getting the help they needed.
[1123.32 → 1124.60] And these pastors sort of, you know,
[1124.86 → 1126.80] the best of American pastors, very entrepreneurial.
[1127.08 → 1128.82] They gathered a bunch of churches together.
[1128.92 → 1130.16] They sort of communicated with other pastors
[1130.16 → 1131.42] and they got a big group of churches
[1131.42 → 1133.82] that together committed to taking, get this,
[1134.20 → 1137.88] every single foster child into one of their homes.
[1138.92 → 1139.68] And they did it.
[1140.50 → 1142.38] They brought all sorts of people in.
[1142.44 → 1143.52] They trained all sorts of families.
[1143.62 → 1145.06] It's a long process, as Carrie mentioned,
[1145.16 → 1146.52] and a lot of pastors themselves said,
[1146.52 → 1148.48] okay, our home's open, our table's open.
[1148.68 → 1149.56] We're going to find a way.
[1149.56 → 1152.04] And they got every child in Phoenix at that time
[1152.04 → 1153.24] into their homes.
[1153.66 → 1154.92] And it was one of these beautiful moments
[1154.92 → 1156.16] where like the city noticed.
[1156.64 → 1158.74] Here's Christians doing what they know
[1158.74 → 1160.84] the Bible calls them to do in our city.
[1161.14 → 1161.68] Imagine that.
[1162.00 → 1163.24] Imagine Christians were actually like,
[1163.32 → 1164.76] hey, we know this is supposed to care for the poor
[1164.76 → 1165.58] and they're doing it.
[1166.00 → 1167.30] And they sort of gained a reputation
[1167.30 → 1168.94] with leaders in the city for doing this.
[1169.86 → 1171.00] And I just want to name like,
[1171.20 → 1172.42] when I first heard this story,
[1172.48 → 1174.14] I always feel the need to share the rest of it.
[1174.14 → 1175.54] It's not like a happily ever after
[1175.54 → 1177.42] because what happened, true story,
[1177.54 → 1178.46] is that neighbouring cities,
[1178.46 → 1180.68] they heard that the churches sort of emptied
[1180.68 → 1181.88] the foster care system in Phoenix.
[1182.02 → 1183.80] And those cities started sending the foster kids
[1183.80 → 1184.20] to Phoenix.
[1184.86 → 1185.78] And all of a sudden, the church was like,
[1185.86 → 1187.38] okay, we got a lot of foster kids here
[1187.38 → 1188.42] and how do we meet the need?
[1188.72 → 1190.04] And they couldn't meet all the needs.
[1190.52 → 1191.56] But it was one of those moments where they said,
[1191.64 → 1192.72] okay, Lord, the need is great.
[1193.42 → 1194.92] It's greater than these churches can do.
[1194.96 → 1197.14] And that's just one area of need in our city,
[1197.34 → 1198.76] not to mention all the rest.
[1199.14 → 1202.26] But we're doing what you've called us to do.
[1203.00 → 1203.26] Right?
[1204.06 → 1205.78] We're doing what you sent us to be.
[1205.78 → 1207.64] We're being light in the areas
[1207.64 → 1208.48] where there's a great need.
[1208.56 → 1209.58] We've got kids in our homes.
[1209.66 → 1211.16] We want to give space for our parents to get better.
[1211.52 → 1214.04] This is the way that we're living out James 1,
[1214.74 → 1216.56] the kind of religion that the Lord says,
[1216.76 → 1218.66] this is pure and faultless.
[1221.64 → 1223.02] I want us to notice, too,
[1223.72 → 1225.78] that this is connected to resisting
[1225.78 → 1227.36] the pollution of the world.
[1227.62 → 1228.40] You know, James says twice,
[1228.46 → 1229.72] sort of getting rid of this old way,
[1230.00 → 1231.38] the polluting influence of the culture.
[1231.46 → 1232.58] And I could talk for a long time
[1232.58 → 1234.74] about the difficulty they would have had in Rome,
[1234.82 → 1236.22] which is very difficult, very greedy,
[1236.44 → 1238.22] oversexed, all sorts of difficulty
[1238.22 → 1239.44] for the church in the first century.
[1239.96 → 1241.96] But here's how I think we need to resist that
[1241.96 → 1242.86] in our context.
[1243.64 → 1245.12] One of the lies,
[1245.54 → 1246.92] one of the powerful lies
[1246.92 → 1248.28] that we hear in our culture,
[1248.64 → 1250.50] in an individualistic culture that we live in,
[1250.56 → 1250.94] is this.
[1251.00 → 1251.54] You ready for it?
[1252.56 → 1254.08] You worry about your own life.
[1254.96 → 1256.40] Let those people worry about theirs.
[1257.68 → 1258.96] They're in the situation they're in
[1258.96 → 1259.86] because of what they've done.
[1259.86 → 1261.46] You do what you need to do.
[1261.58 → 1263.06] You focus on what you have to do
[1263.06 → 1265.22] to succeed and thrive and enjoy your life.
[1265.30 → 1267.36] You just stay in your lane
[1267.36 → 1269.42] and do the best you can with what you've got.
[1269.64 → 1271.52] Don't worry about the surrounding mess.
[1272.70 → 1274.46] That, by the way, runs deep in your bones,
[1274.76 → 1275.36] deeper than you think.
[1275.38 → 1276.60] It runs deep in my bones.
[1276.70 → 1277.40] It's like, I don't want to know
[1277.40 → 1278.24] about the surrounding needs.
[1278.32 → 1279.48] I don't have the capacity for it.
[1279.60 → 1281.50] I want to just do what I need to do for my life
[1281.50 → 1283.12] and make the best of this difficulty
[1283.12 → 1284.02] I already have, right?
[1284.44 → 1285.40] Does that sound about right for you?
[1286.08 → 1287.02] And James just, like,
[1287.02 → 1288.36] chops right through that.
[1289.36 → 1289.96] And he says,
[1290.22 → 1291.78] the church, if it is the church,
[1291.84 → 1292.68] if it's the religion
[1292.68 → 1294.28] that's pure and faultless to God,
[1294.74 → 1295.98] it's going to give itself away
[1295.98 → 1296.82] for the needs of the city.
[1297.72 → 1300.32] It's going to pour itself out like Jesus
[1300.32 → 1302.56] for the blessing of others.
[1303.50 → 1305.24] And as one person once said of the church,
[1305.34 → 1306.86] the church is the only institution
[1306.86 → 1309.56] that exists for the sake of others.
[1310.40 → 1313.00] It exists for the sake of the needs of the city.
[1313.00 → 1315.62] How's it going here at Hope?
[1317.20 → 1319.16] You know, I know there's a lot of stuff
[1319.16 → 1320.16] that happens in our church.
[1320.70 → 1321.46] You know, week after week,
[1321.52 → 1322.52] a lot of it's done very quietly,
[1322.64 → 1323.82] writing letters to people in prison,
[1324.70 → 1327.02] visiting seniors who can't come to church,
[1327.08 → 1327.76] who are isolated,
[1327.92 → 1328.78] making meals for people
[1328.78 → 1330.86] who are struggling in a whole variety of ways,
[1331.58 → 1333.42] spending time with those who are depressed
[1333.42 → 1335.20] and struggling through mental health challenges,
[1335.98 → 1337.62] serving at the Coverdale Community Kitchen,
[1337.74 → 1339.90] getting involved in the Adams Road Breakfast Program,
[1340.34 → 1342.50] providing funds for the abuse victim care.
[1342.50 → 1343.40] By the way, I got an email
[1343.40 → 1345.20] from the counselling program
[1345.20 → 1346.74] that did all the care
[1346.74 → 1347.60] and the trauma counselling
[1347.60 → 1348.76] for women in our own city,
[1348.86 → 1350.18] and they just sent a word of gratitude
[1350.18 → 1352.56] and fostering and adopting.
[1352.68 → 1353.46] There are a number of things
[1353.46 → 1354.64] that believers in our church do.
[1355.36 → 1356.54] But I think we need to just pause
[1356.54 → 1357.36] and ask,
[1358.52 → 1360.16] what's God placing on your heart?
[1361.10 → 1362.28] We know we're called
[1362.28 → 1363.54] to serve in the needs of the city.
[1363.86 → 1365.68] What's the stuff that He's placed on your heart?
[1365.74 → 1366.98] We're not all called to the same thing.
[1367.38 → 1369.28] And it may not be that widows and orphans
[1369.28 → 1370.02] are the burning,
[1370.20 → 1371.42] the most burning need in our city.
[1371.42 → 1372.44] There may be other things.
[1372.96 → 1373.80] But it's worth bringing
[1373.80 → 1375.28] to the conversation at lunch today
[1375.28 → 1376.72] or at dinner or with your small group,
[1377.56 → 1379.22] what's God percolating in my heart?
[1380.08 → 1381.04] Could be foster care.
[1381.58 → 1382.30] Could be adoption.
[1382.78 → 1383.72] Could be serving in the kitchen.
[1383.88 → 1385.50] Could be spending time with people on the margins
[1385.50 → 1386.62] in a whole variety of ways.
[1386.68 → 1388.90] What matters is we're asking
[1388.90 → 1391.02] and inviting the Spirit to guide and lead.
[1391.10 → 1392.92] And don't be surprised when those burdens,
[1393.08 → 1394.28] maybe you had 10, 15 years ago,
[1394.38 → 1395.08] reemerge, and you say,
[1395.18 → 1396.68] yes, now's the season.
[1396.68 → 1398.42] For us to open our home,
[1398.94 → 1399.98] to open our wallets,
[1400.06 → 1400.82] to open our space,
[1400.90 → 1401.94] to open our time,
[1402.30 → 1404.00] to give our lives away
[1404.00 → 1405.26] in the way of Jesus
[1405.26 → 1406.26] for the blessing of others.
[1406.26 → 1412.38] We've covered a lot of ground today.
[1414.12 → 1415.04] Slow to speak,
[1415.72 → 1416.36] quick to listen.
[1417.06 → 1418.02] Slow to become angry.
[1418.50 → 1419.80] Not just listening to the Word,
[1419.88 → 1420.54] but doing it.
[1420.92 → 1422.24] And being people who are actually
[1422.24 → 1424.16] showing concrete love and care
[1424.16 → 1425.66] as Jesus modelled
[1425.66 → 1426.78] to the needs in our city.
[1427.30 → 1428.76] I don't know how this is all sitting with you,
[1428.84 → 1430.74] but can I just share my own process this week?
[1431.32 → 1432.80] This felt overwhelming to me.
[1433.34 → 1434.90] Because all three of these things
[1434.90 → 1436.04] are hard for me.
[1436.06 → 1436.80] Are they hard for you?
[1437.54 → 1438.62] I am quick to speak
[1438.62 → 1439.48] and slow to listen.
[1440.30 → 1441.66] I am quick to become angry.
[1441.80 → 1442.46] Just ask my children.
[1443.48 → 1444.64] It's not easy for me
[1444.64 → 1445.82] to have the deep compassion
[1445.82 → 1446.84] to give my time
[1446.84 → 1447.92] to the needs of the city.
[1447.92 → 1449.48] And I can quickly become selfish
[1449.48 → 1450.72] and even angry
[1450.72 → 1452.06] at all the stuff that's going on
[1452.06 → 1453.00] that makes my life difficult.
[1453.24 → 1454.28] And I look at these passages
[1454.28 → 1455.32] and what James says,
[1455.46 → 1456.40] this is true religion.
[1457.04 → 1458.24] This is obedient faith.
[1458.32 → 1459.54] This is the way Jesus modelled.
[1459.78 → 1460.88] I can feel overwhelmed.
[1460.98 → 1461.26] Do you?
[1462.24 → 1463.56] And I finish this sermon
[1463.56 → 1464.32] and this is not how
[1464.32 → 1465.20] I normally finish sermons,
[1465.36 → 1465.70] but I just,
[1465.80 → 1466.78] I kind of say to myself,
[1467.32 → 1467.66] Jesus,
[1468.20 → 1469.92] we desperately need to change us.
[1470.68 → 1472.08] Because this kind of faith,
[1472.26 → 1472.94] this kind of church
[1472.94 → 1473.94] doesn't come out of us.
[1474.16 → 1475.12] It doesn't come from our hearts.
[1475.20 → 1476.16] It comes from God
[1476.16 → 1476.90] through Jesus
[1476.90 → 1477.98] by the power of the Spirit.
[1478.40 → 1478.66] Jesus,
[1478.78 → 1480.00] we need you to change us.
[1480.04 → 1480.66] Do you feel that?
[1481.80 → 1482.68] And so I said to Stu
[1482.68 → 1483.34] later this week
[1483.34 → 1484.12] when I was working on my sermon
[1484.12 → 1484.74] trying to figure out
[1484.74 → 1485.24] how I want to finish.
[1485.34 → 1485.54] I said,
[1485.60 → 1485.82] Stu,
[1485.98 → 1487.14] I think I want to have a time
[1487.14 → 1488.00] of extended prayer
[1488.00 → 1488.90] and confession
[1488.90 → 1489.58] and repentance
[1489.58 → 1490.40] and rededication
[1490.40 → 1491.46] after my sermon.
[1491.74 → 1493.12] So that's what we get to do today.
[1493.72 → 1494.52] I'm going to pray
[1494.52 → 1495.74] through these sections.
[1496.42 → 1497.18] Leave lots of time
[1497.18 → 1498.04] for awkward silence
[1498.04 → 1498.88] and you can pray
[1498.88 → 1499.88] however you feel
[1499.88 → 1500.66] compelled to pray
[1500.66 → 1502.38] through these different dimensions
[1502.38 → 1503.36] of James' wisdom
[1503.36 → 1504.14] on being the church.
[1504.58 → 1505.30] And after that,
[1505.40 → 1505.80] the worship team
[1505.80 → 1506.32] is going to come up
[1506.32 → 1506.80] and we're going to sing
[1506.80 → 1507.80] a song of rededicating
[1507.80 → 1508.56] our lives
[1508.56 → 1509.64] to the way of Jesus.
[1509.94 → 1510.54] Does that sound good?
[1511.52 → 1512.32] Let's pray together.
[1519.68 → 1520.04] Father,
[1520.10 → 1520.68] we want to start
[1520.68 → 1521.22] with gratitude
[1521.22 → 1522.02] for your word.
[1523.66 → 1524.50] And there are times
[1524.50 → 1524.92] where your word
[1524.92 → 1525.76] comforts us
[1525.76 → 1527.18] and there are times
[1527.18 → 1528.34] where it pierces us.
[1529.44 → 1530.74] And we receive
[1530.74 → 1531.74] these challenging words
[1531.74 → 1532.44] with humility.
[1533.72 → 1535.24] We receive these words
[1535.24 → 1535.78] with a sense
[1535.78 → 1536.78] of wanting you
[1536.78 → 1537.86] to change us.
[1539.14 → 1540.06] In the areas
[1540.06 → 1540.96] where we are convicted,
[1541.14 → 1541.24] Lord,
[1541.30 → 1542.26] we ask for you
[1542.26 → 1543.58] to bring change.
[1544.46 → 1546.04] We want to reflect
[1546.04 → 1547.06] the love of Jesus.
[1548.04 → 1549.14] We want to speak
[1549.14 → 1549.70] like Jesus.
[1550.58 → 1552.20] We want to conduct
[1552.20 → 1553.44] ourselves in conflict
[1553.44 → 1554.10] like Jesus
[1554.10 → 1554.96] and we want to care
[1554.96 → 1555.64] for this city
[1555.64 → 1556.24] like Jesus.
[1556.36 → 1557.18] So have your way
[1557.18 → 1557.74] with us.
[1559.02 → 1559.66] And so first,
[1559.84 → 1560.00] Father,
[1560.06 → 1561.00] we bring before you
[1561.00 → 1562.08] our loose tongues,
[1563.16 → 1564.52] our deceitful lips,
[1565.28 → 1566.10] the slander,
[1566.72 → 1567.50] the way we speak
[1567.50 → 1568.34] ill of others
[1568.34 → 1569.44] and dehumanize those
[1569.44 → 1570.42] with whom we disagree.
[1570.98 → 1572.16] Have mercy on us,
[1572.24 → 1572.70] we pray.
[1572.70 → 1573.92] We bring before you
[1573.92 → 1574.64] our hearts.
[1585.64 → 1589.34] and we live on a right.
[1589.42 → 1590.44] good sleep,
[1590.44 → 1590.78] eyes,
[1590.78 → 1591.96] and literally
[1591.96 → 1593.26] how to pray.
[1593.26 → 1606.10] taboo how to yo
[1606.10 → 1606.40] ultimately
[1606.40 → 1606.42] in reality.
[1606.42 → 1623.96] Father, we bring before you our neglect of the scriptures.
[1625.06 → 1628.14] The way we have no practice of actually reading your word
[1628.14 → 1630.28] or skimming your word and moving on.
[1631.20 → 1633.10] We bring before you our laziness,
[1634.08 → 1635.36] our stubbornness,
[1635.36 → 1639.56] and our unwillingness to do what it is that you've called us to do.
[1640.16 → 1641.54] Have mercy on us.
[1665.36 → 1687.34] Father, we bring before you the needs of our city,
[1687.34 → 1693.20] the neighbours and coworkers and friends that you have invited us to love,
[1693.64 → 1696.14] to visit, to care for.
[1696.14 → 1702.94] Father, we pray, Lord, that you would give us hearts that have compassion,
[1704.30 → 1709.32] homes that are open to whatever needs are around us,
[1710.64 → 1715.30] time for the people we'd rather not give our time to.
[1715.30 → 1717.86] Have mercy on us.
[1717.86 → 1718.30] Amen.
[1718.30 → 1719.30] Amen.
[1719.30 → 1720.30] Amen.
[1720.30 → 1720.42] Amen.
[1720.54 → 1724.70] Amen.
[1725.20 → 1725.36] Amen.
[1725.40 → 1726.40] Amen.
[1726.56 → 1727.46] Amen.
[1727.46 → 1728.56] Amen.
[1728.56 → 1754.70] Father, we echo the words of James,
[1755.40 → 1757.56] who praises you for being compassionate,
[1758.56 → 1759.98] and full of mercy.
[1761.28 → 1763.78] We thank you for the way that you meet us in our weakness,
[1764.30 → 1766.12] and you do not write us off.
[1766.98 → 1769.62] And we thank you that the one who defeated the grave
[1769.62 → 1772.84] and conquered sin walks with us.
[1773.86 → 1776.20] And we ask that you, by the work of Jesus,
[1777.12 → 1778.30] through the power of the Spirit,
[1778.38 → 1780.02] would pick us up in our areas of weakness,
[1781.02 → 1783.92] would strengthen us with your strength,
[1784.22 → 1787.44] and fill us with the love, the perseverance,
[1787.44 → 1790.38] the patience, and the compassion we need
[1790.38 → 1793.26] to be a faithful church in this city.
[1794.12 → 1795.32] All praise be to Jesus.
[1796.00 → 1796.30] Amen.
[1798.90 → 1801.64] Would you stand with me and sing a song of rededication,
[1801.86 → 1802.88] Jesus, all for Jesus.
[1802.88 → 1802.94] presence.
[1818.54 → 1819.54] Amen.
[1819.60 → 1820.34] Amen.
[1820.34 → 1820.52] Amen.
[1820.52 → 1821.72] Amen.
[1821.72 → 1822.34] Amen.
[1822.34 → 1822.76] Amen.
[1822.76 → 1823.00] Amen.
[1823.92 → 1824.84] Amen.
[1825.10 → 1825.40] Amen.
[1825.40 → 1827.20] Amen.
[1827.60 → 1832.16] Amen.
