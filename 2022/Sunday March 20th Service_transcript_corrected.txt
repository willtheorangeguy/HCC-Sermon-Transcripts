[0.00 → 5.00] I'd like to thank Mrs. Pastor Sid.
[10.82 → 12.64] Unusual that she calls me pastor.
[15.70 → 17.20] Good morning to you all.
[19.44 → 22.42] I often say it's so good to be with you,
[22.84 → 25.08] and I really, really mean it,
[25.38 → 28.44] because I truly need this, and so do you.
[30.00 → 31.28] And all of you online as well.
[31.90 → 35.92] There's so much to get stressed about, to struggle with,
[36.70 → 40.58] and sometimes when I'm on my own, it can kind of get to me.
[41.98 → 44.04] And then when I gather with others like this,
[44.08 → 45.90] and in other ways as well, who follow Christ,
[45.90 → 49.82] somehow I get reg rounded in Christ with you.
[51.04 → 55.80] We hold such incredible truths in our frail human hands,
[55.80 → 60.28] and we comprehend so little the depth of what God has given us,
[60.80 → 62.04] and so we get together,
[62.46 → 64.92] and with the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit,
[65.26 → 69.58] we sense a presence and a power which far transcends us.
[71.18 → 72.38] And that's important.
[72.92 → 74.14] Deeply, deeply important.
[74.44 → 77.98] And I think that's what Jesus is trying to get his followers
[77.98 → 79.38] to understand a little more
[79.38 → 82.08] in the passage we're going to deal without of John today,
[82.16 → 83.00] out of John 14.
[84.16 → 85.62] As has been mentioned previously,
[86.06 → 89.44] most seminarians learn to call John 13 through 17
[89.44 → 90.66] the farewell discourse,
[91.22 → 94.16] because it's the passage where Jesus is saying goodbye,
[94.16 → 96.82] and he's going to go to his death and resurrection.
[97.76 → 101.62] Gordon Fee, a professor, refers to them as table talks.
[102.52 → 103.78] And I kind of like that one,
[103.88 → 105.98] where Jesus is sitting around a table
[105.98 → 108.52] in deep conversation with his disciples,
[109.02 → 110.68] and he's talking about his upcoming death.
[111.32 → 114.76] Jesus spends his last evening with his own,
[114.90 → 115.84] his closest friends.
[116.70 → 118.06] He washes their feet,
[118.58 → 119.44] he eats with them,
[119.48 → 120.84] he talks about the betrayal,
[121.32 → 122.58] he talks about the denial.
[122.78 → 124.22] I mean, what an evening.
[125.12 → 126.52] You can only imagine, so can I.
[127.52 → 128.50] And then he said this,
[128.58 → 128.88] he said,
[128.88 → 132.86] I go prepare a place for you in my father's house,
[133.22 → 134.80] my father's dwelling,
[134.80 → 136.12] some translations would say.
[136.46 → 137.34] And I will come back,
[137.38 → 138.88] and I will take you to be with me.
[139.12 → 140.82] And I get the sense that John's playing around
[140.82 → 143.20] with this phrase that he used in John 1,
[143.32 → 143.74] where Jesus,
[143.86 → 145.26] when Jesus came in the incarnation,
[145.82 → 146.38] and where it said,
[146.48 → 147.36] the word became flesh,
[147.42 → 149.08] and made his dwelling among us.
[149.22 → 151.62] And this idea of this ongoing dwelling
[151.62 → 154.78] is taking place throughout John's gospel.
[156.16 → 157.06] After this, then,
[157.14 → 157.84] the disciples,
[158.10 → 159.78] they have a bunch of questions,
[159.98 → 160.30] you know, like,
[160.38 → 161.04] where are you going?
[161.46 → 161.96] Jesus said,
[162.02 → 162.86] you know the way.
[162.96 → 163.16] And we said,
[163.20 → 164.24] well, we don't know the way.
[164.24 → 165.08] And Thomas,
[165.30 → 165.66] and Philip,
[165.78 → 166.14] and Peter,
[166.26 → 167.54] and a guy named another Judas,
[167.66 → 168.98] they all have these questions.
[169.72 → 171.34] And Jesus basically replies,
[172.04 → 173.64] he is the way,
[173.98 → 176.06] and to know him is both the way
[176.06 → 177.42] and the destination,
[178.04 → 179.78] which is what we all need to hear.
[180.80 → 182.30] It's about communion,
[182.60 → 183.32] and community,
[183.60 → 185.08] and oneness with the Father,
[185.18 → 187.26] which is a theme we read about regularly.
[188.22 → 189.90] So we're going to jump into today's passage.
[190.08 → 191.14] John 14,
[191.14 → 193.28] verse 11 through 31.
[193.42 → 194.16] Look at it with me,
[195.16 → 196.28] where John begins,
[196.92 → 197.74] and Jesus speaks.
[197.88 → 201.16] Believe me when I say that I am in the Father,
[201.22 → 202.34] and the Father is in me.
[202.68 → 204.82] Pay special attention to the word in.
[205.54 → 207.36] I want to point out some things with that.
[208.00 → 208.12] So,
[208.40 → 209.56] I am in the Father,
[209.62 → 210.42] and the Father is in me,
[210.46 → 212.92] or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves.
[213.60 → 214.14] Very truly,
[214.26 → 214.78] I tell you,
[214.86 → 216.26] whoever believes in me
[216.26 → 218.28] will do the works I have been doing,
[218.28 → 220.60] and they will do even greater things than these,
[221.10 → 222.18] because I'm going to the Father.
[223.10 → 224.98] And I will do whatever you ask in my name,
[225.04 → 226.82] so the Father may be glorified in the Son.
[227.14 → 229.90] And you may ask me for anything in my name,
[229.92 → 230.52] and I will do it.
[230.72 → 231.54] And if you love me,
[231.68 → 232.58] keep my commands.
[233.12 → 234.26] And I will ask the Father,
[234.56 → 236.36] and he will give you another advocate
[236.36 → 240.22] to help you and be with you forever.
[240.78 → 242.06] The Spirit of truth.
[242.06 → 244.16] The world cannot accept him,
[244.26 → 246.62] because it neither sees him nor knows him.
[246.76 → 247.66] But you know him,
[247.70 → 248.76] for he lives with you,
[248.82 → 251.44] and will be in you.
[252.38 → 253.94] I will not leave you as orphans.
[254.48 → 255.48] I will come to you.
[255.62 → 256.18] Before long,
[256.26 → 257.46] the world will not see me anymore,
[257.54 → 258.40] but you will see me,
[258.52 → 259.54] because I live,
[259.62 → 260.80] you will also live.
[261.74 → 262.38] And on that day,
[262.42 → 264.66] you will realize that I am in my Father,
[264.90 → 266.24] and you are in me,
[266.34 → 267.68] and I am in you.
[268.64 → 269.94] And whoever has my commands,
[269.94 → 270.62] and keeps them,
[270.62 → 271.86] is the one who loves me.
[272.66 → 273.62] And the one who loves me,
[273.70 → 275.44] will be loved by my Father,
[275.50 → 276.58] and I too will love them,
[276.64 → 277.74] and show myself to them.
[278.02 → 278.62] And then Judas,
[278.70 → 279.82] not Judas Iscariot said,
[280.06 → 280.42] but Lord,
[280.48 → 282.18] why do you intend to show yourself to us,
[282.24 → 283.02] and not the world?
[284.34 → 284.98] Jesus replied,
[285.08 → 285.88] anyone who loves me,
[285.94 → 286.94] will obey my teachings.
[287.50 → 288.56] My Father will love them,
[288.58 → 289.34] and will come to them,
[289.38 → 290.58] and make our home,
[290.90 → 291.86] we could say our dwelling,
[292.20 → 292.82] with them.
[293.18 → 294.52] And anyone who does not love me,
[294.54 → 295.78] will not obey my teachings.
[296.00 → 297.04] And these words you hear,
[297.04 → 297.74] are not my own,
[297.74 → 298.66] they belong to the Father,
[298.94 → 299.74] who sent me.
[300.58 → 301.28] All this,
[301.36 → 302.04] I have spoken,
[302.16 → 303.26] while still with you.
[303.50 → 304.32] But the advocate,
[304.46 → 305.20] the Holy Spirit,
[305.50 → 306.18] whom the Father,
[306.64 → 308.30] will send in my name,
[308.36 → 309.28] will teach you all things,
[309.34 → 310.24] and will remind you,
[310.30 → 311.98] everything I have said to you.
[313.00 → 314.00] Peace I leave with you.
[314.72 → 315.66] My peace I give you.
[315.74 → 316.44] I do not give,
[316.48 → 317.34] as the world gives.
[318.26 → 319.24] Don't let your hearts,
[319.24 → 319.80] be troubled.
[319.88 → 320.52] Don't be afraid.
[321.26 → 322.14] You've heard me say,
[322.24 → 322.96] I am going away,
[323.02 → 324.20] and I'm coming back to you.
[324.42 → 325.18] If you love me,
[325.18 → 326.22] you would be glad,
[326.38 → 327.10] that I'm going to the Father,
[327.40 → 328.84] for the Father is greater than I.
[329.74 → 330.72] And I have told you now,
[330.78 → 331.68] before it happens,
[331.76 → 332.88] so that when it does happen,
[332.96 → 333.62] you will believe.
[334.32 → 336.04] I will not say much more to you,
[336.10 → 337.46] for the prince of this world is coming,
[337.52 → 338.44] he has no hold over me.
[338.80 → 339.44] But he comes,
[339.52 → 340.78] so that the world may learn,
[341.12 → 342.08] that I love the Father,
[342.74 → 344.72] and do exactly what my Father has commanded me.
[345.52 → 345.80] Come.
[346.58 → 347.52] Now let us leave.
[350.36 → 352.96] The disciples are confused,
[352.96 → 354.24] and fearful of the future,
[354.24 → 355.96] with all this uncertainty,
[356.26 → 358.22] and Jesus talking about leaving.
[359.50 → 361.36] That wasn't the game plan,
[361.44 → 362.00] in their minds.
[363.12 → 363.94] The game plan,
[364.00 → 364.50] in their minds,
[364.56 → 366.36] involved overthrowing the Roman Empire,
[366.98 → 369.94] involved establishing Israel,
[369.94 → 371.10] in its glory again.
[371.46 → 372.42] And it's clear,
[372.90 → 375.34] that they don't get the real plan.
[376.60 → 377.58] It's also clear,
[377.70 → 378.66] that they aren't going to make it,
[378.66 → 379.38] on their own,
[379.38 → 380.94] without Jesus.
[381.48 → 382.40] Even though they've spent,
[382.50 → 383.26] a lot of time with Jesus.
[383.38 → 384.56] It's Thursday evening,
[385.08 → 386.40] before the crucifixion,
[386.46 → 387.42] they've shared a meal,
[387.80 → 388.74] and Jesus has offered,
[388.86 → 390.66] an example of selfless love,
[390.72 → 392.16] and service with the washing of the feet.
[392.58 → 393.26] And now,
[393.52 → 395.44] Jesus prepares them,
[395.94 → 396.80] for his departure.
[398.70 → 399.28] Seems to me,
[399.34 → 400.36] they should have been helping him,
[400.56 → 401.42] prepare for his ordeal.
[403.00 → 403.14] Right?
[404.18 → 405.60] We had a good friend of ours,
[405.96 → 406.56] named Jerry,
[406.74 → 408.22] she was a good friend,
[408.26 → 408.96] and a fellow teacher,
[408.96 → 409.90] I was a teacher at the time,
[410.00 → 411.54] and you know,
[411.66 → 412.50] she got cancer,
[412.66 → 413.58] and she was single,
[413.76 → 415.58] and no family around really,
[415.74 → 417.66] and we promised her,
[417.72 → 418.48] she wouldn't die alone.
[419.00 → 420.30] And so she lived in our house,
[420.36 → 422.54] for the last three weeks of her life.
[424.48 → 424.92] You know,
[424.94 → 425.68] I never thought,
[425.94 → 426.22] you know,
[426.30 → 427.60] that it was about us,
[427.84 → 429.30] about her giving us anything,
[429.38 → 429.86] it was about us,
[429.94 → 430.70] trying to help her,
[430.94 → 431.62] on this journey.
[431.68 → 432.72] And I had that picture,
[432.92 → 433.60] with the disciple,
[433.70 → 433.98] and that too.
[434.34 → 435.80] Jesus is talking about his death,
[436.06 → 437.14] and they're all worried,
[437.14 → 439.14] about their misgivings,
[439.26 → 440.40] and their distress,
[440.56 → 441.44] and their confusion.
[441.86 → 442.80] I get their confusion,
[443.16 → 443.70] but you know,
[443.78 → 445.86] they lose the focus on Jesus,
[446.00 → 446.62] and what he's doing.
[447.34 → 448.60] I think as a people,
[448.60 → 449.32] and a culture,
[449.72 → 451.02] we're not terribly good,
[451.10 → 452.46] at talking about loss.
[453.92 → 455.74] We seem to lack the resources,
[455.94 → 457.06] and the emotional wherewithal,
[457.14 → 458.68] to acknowledge the losses,
[458.90 → 460.30] we and those around us suffer.
[460.30 → 462.02] And then,
[462.14 → 462.74] like the disciples,
[462.88 → 463.92] it shakes us up,
[464.10 → 465.34] and our sense of safety,
[465.46 → 465.94] and security,
[466.06 → 466.48] and comfort,
[466.64 → 468.10] is messed up.
[468.32 → 469.72] Even those of us,
[469.88 → 470.98] who are with Jesus.
[472.84 → 473.78] And Jesus says,
[474.02 → 474.62] to them,
[474.72 → 476.32] I'm not going to leave you,
[476.50 → 477.36] as orphans,
[478.20 → 478.72] abandoned,
[479.10 → 479.46] and alone.
[481.60 → 483.02] I'm struck by these images,
[483.02 → 483.98] that Jesus chooses,
[484.16 → 485.06] to describe us,
[485.28 → 486.04] when we attempt,
[486.18 → 487.10] to live life,
[487.26 → 488.36] on our own resources,
[488.36 → 489.24] without power,
[489.34 → 490.44] outside ourselves.
[491.84 → 492.92] Then we're orphans.
[494.16 → 494.94] We're helpless.
[495.52 → 496.96] In need of so much.
[497.78 → 499.36] We can't do it alone.
[499.42 → 500.26] That's the message here.
[500.54 → 500.88] Earlier,
[501.04 → 501.80] Jesus had said,
[501.88 → 502.72] when he looked at the people,
[502.80 → 503.02] he said,
[503.28 → 504.28] they're like sheep,
[504.42 → 505.32] without a shepherd.
[506.24 → 506.44] Right?
[506.52 → 507.04] They're like sheep,
[507.04 → 507.64] without a shepherd.
[507.74 → 508.80] Not knowing where to go,
[509.06 → 510.00] easily attacked,
[510.28 → 510.72] frightened,
[511.18 → 512.46] as Pastor Dave said,
[512.58 → 513.46] in his sermon about sheep,
[513.66 → 514.30] kind of dumb.
[516.26 → 517.22] That's what they're like.
[519.08 → 519.56] Orphans.
[520.72 → 522.12] Sheep without a shepherd.
[522.34 → 522.88] They're on their own.
[522.92 → 523.92] They don't have the resources.
[525.06 → 525.26] You know,
[525.38 → 527.14] I see a spiritual director,
[527.46 → 528.80] once a month.
[530.44 → 532.54] And he likes to remind me,
[532.66 → 532.76] and he,
[533.14 → 533.32] you know,
[533.36 → 534.22] sometimes when I'm,
[534.22 → 535.12] complaining,
[535.34 → 535.94] or sharing,
[536.32 → 537.28] my misgivings,
[537.32 → 538.08] or my anxiety,
[538.24 → 538.52] or my,
[538.74 → 539.28] whatever,
[539.42 → 539.96] my stresses,
[540.36 → 541.36] and I share them,
[541.36 → 543.28] and then he says to me,
[543.52 → 543.78] Sid,
[544.58 → 545.72] you're a branch.
[545.72 → 549.50] Thank you.
[551.44 → 553.20] But he's referencing this passage,
[553.28 → 553.84] out of John,
[554.20 → 554.86] John 15.
[555.04 → 556.16] And so someone's going to talk about it,
[556.16 → 556.36] I'm sure,
[556.72 → 557.48] down the road here,
[557.58 → 558.80] because we're coming to it next,
[558.92 → 560.06] but look at it with me.
[560.18 → 560.86] Remain in me,
[560.92 → 561.50] Jesus says,
[561.82 → 564.08] as I also remain in you.
[564.16 → 565.10] There's that in thing again.
[565.44 → 567.30] No branch can bear fruit by itself.
[567.52 → 569.96] It must remain in the vine.
[570.52 → 571.84] Neither can you bear fruit,
[572.04 → 573.78] unless you remain in me.
[574.22 → 575.02] I am the vine.
[575.18 → 575.82] You're the branches.
[576.62 → 577.40] And if you remain in me,
[577.44 → 577.98] and I in you,
[578.06 → 578.84] you will bear much fruit.
[578.94 → 579.46] Apart from me,
[579.48 → 580.04] you can do nothing,
[580.14 → 580.76] because apart from me,
[580.80 → 581.66] there isn't light.
[582.52 → 583.86] That's what Jesus is saying there.
[584.78 → 588.36] Branches don't do well by themselves.
[589.92 → 592.38] The stick you pick up on the ground
[592.38 → 594.74] isn't bearing anything,
[595.64 → 599.94] because it's not connected to the tree,
[600.14 → 600.84] to the vine.
[600.84 → 603.44] A bunch of branches together
[603.44 → 605.50] don't do any good,
[605.56 → 607.10] because there's no life in them.
[607.50 → 608.82] And I think we need to hear,
[609.26 → 609.44] you know,
[609.48 → 609.92] without me,
[610.00 → 610.50] you're orphans.
[610.60 → 611.08] Without me,
[611.24 → 612.38] your sheep without a shepherd.
[612.70 → 613.48] Without me,
[613.68 → 616.12] you're just a disconnected branch.
[618.24 → 618.80] Sid,
[619.00 → 620.06] you're a branch.
[622.32 → 624.38] Stay attached to the vine.
[625.44 → 625.96] Sid,
[626.08 → 627.04] you're not an orphan,
[627.18 → 628.36] even when you feel like one,
[628.36 → 629.30] on your own,
[629.42 → 630.22] because you're not alone,
[630.28 → 632.24] and I think we all feel that way at times.
[632.88 → 633.12] You know,
[633.16 → 634.74] we watch the horror in Ukraine,
[634.86 → 636.10] it all feels so hopeless.
[636.50 → 639.20] We hear or experience stories of abuse,
[639.28 → 639.88] or disease,
[640.08 → 640.76] or struggle,
[641.00 → 642.92] and we live lives centred on fear,
[642.96 → 643.48] and anxiety,
[643.64 → 644.36] feeling alone,
[644.50 → 645.20] feeling abandoned,
[645.36 → 646.22] feeling out of control,
[646.40 → 648.16] and that's how the disciples are feeling.
[648.16 → 650.50] They're feeling fear and uncertainty,
[651.00 → 652.72] as Jesus talks about leaving them.
[652.72 → 655.58] And he assures them,
[655.62 → 656.98] and he reassures them,
[657.62 → 659.18] with eternal promises,
[659.64 → 661.66] of him dwelling with them,
[661.94 → 666.04] of being in a home together forever.
[668.22 → 670.52] He gives them the promise of the Holy Spirit.
[671.38 → 671.74] He's saying,
[671.84 → 672.06] guys,
[672.20 → 672.94] your branches,
[673.08 → 673.70] I'm the vine,
[673.84 → 675.06] I'll always be with you.
[675.58 → 676.60] I bring you life.
[678.66 → 681.02] We read in verse 16 there,
[681.02 → 681.32] and we say,
[681.40 → 682.28] I will ask the Father,
[682.34 → 684.40] and he will give you another advocate
[684.40 → 685.32] to help you,
[685.72 → 687.42] and be with you forever.
[687.78 → 689.12] The Spirit of truth.
[689.88 → 690.96] Another advocate,
[691.74 → 693.10] who will be in you,
[693.18 → 694.90] not just with you.
[696.42 → 697.16] In you.
[697.16 → 697.22] In you.
[699.80 → 701.38] Did you ever think of that?
[702.86 → 706.92] You have the Spirit of God in you.
[706.92 → 710.34] That's deeply,
[710.62 → 711.52] deeply intimate.
[712.70 → 715.38] That's profoundly close.
[715.88 → 717.06] Beyond close.
[717.92 → 719.72] You have the Spirit of God in you.
[720.16 → 721.14] And I think this was,
[721.36 → 721.86] at this point,
[721.94 → 724.16] beyond the disciples' understanding.
[724.30 → 724.62] After all,
[724.64 → 725.56] they needed the Holy Spirit
[725.56 → 727.68] to kind of learn to comprehend that truth.
[728.04 → 730.04] But the Spirit is in us.
[731.04 → 732.12] The Spirit is in us.
[732.18 → 733.10] Think about that.
[733.10 → 735.72] And I want to ask you,
[735.84 → 737.32] do you believe that?
[739.12 → 740.62] Because if you do,
[740.72 → 742.60] it ought to change the way you live.
[744.12 → 746.48] It ought to change us profoundly,
[746.64 → 747.88] how we approach life.
[748.20 → 750.00] The Spirit of God is in me,
[750.06 → 750.90] and with me,
[751.14 → 752.18] and through me.
[755.06 → 755.54] You know,
[755.82 → 758.18] this passage isn't denying
[758.18 → 759.90] that there are things to be anxious about,
[760.02 → 760.82] there are things to worry about,
[760.88 → 761.94] there's problems and struggles.
[761.94 → 762.96] It isn't denying that.
[763.10 → 763.62] It's saying,
[763.78 → 764.82] there is a power greater
[764.82 → 766.36] than those things in you.
[767.84 → 769.98] That should change the way we look at it.
[770.22 → 771.76] We don't have to flop it all off
[771.76 → 772.70] as if it's nothing.
[773.10 → 773.38] No, no.
[773.62 → 776.12] It's profoundly hard sometimes.
[776.48 → 778.20] But there is a greater power
[778.20 → 779.56] at work in us than that.
[780.18 → 781.56] And it's given to us
[781.56 → 782.32] through the sacrifice
[782.32 → 783.18] of the one who is the way,
[783.24 → 784.12] the truth, and the life.
[784.76 → 785.70] And in this, then,
[785.78 → 787.84] we face the brokenness of the world
[787.84 → 788.94] and the grief that comes
[788.94 → 791.06] simply from living in a broken world.
[791.06 → 793.78] We're not trying to pretend
[793.78 → 794.88] problems don't exist.
[795.56 → 796.16] Jesus says,
[796.66 → 799.14] trust my presence in it all.
[800.82 → 801.68] In it all.
[803.08 → 804.48] Trust my love in it all,
[804.52 → 805.24] for I am with you
[805.24 → 806.34] till the end of the world.
[807.04 → 807.68] And then,
[807.84 → 808.54] with the disciples,
[808.62 → 809.62] in the midst of trials,
[809.70 → 810.48] in the midst of problems,
[810.66 → 811.58] we can then proclaim
[811.58 → 812.68] with all boldness,
[812.68 → 815.34] God is with us.
[817.14 → 818.14] God is with us.
[820.48 → 822.82] Even when we feel confused
[822.82 → 823.44] or anxious.
[824.14 → 825.90] Even when we stand
[825.90 → 827.40] in the face of death itself.
[831.60 → 833.94] I think one of the more
[833.94 → 834.58] profound moments
[834.58 → 836.72] I experienced as a pastor
[836.72 → 838.98] was baptizing a woman
[838.98 → 841.06] who was dying of cancer,
[841.06 → 842.30] but she wanted to be baptized
[842.30 → 843.36] and I baptized her
[843.36 → 844.78] as she lay in her hospital bed
[844.78 → 846.86] and she gasped for air
[846.86 → 849.44] as I baptized her
[849.44 → 852.22] and she smiled with radiance
[852.22 → 853.72] as it happened.
[855.48 → 855.72] You know,
[855.78 → 857.34] this profound moment
[857.34 → 859.50] of God with her
[859.50 → 860.68] in the midst of her
[860.68 → 861.74] leaving this life
[861.74 → 862.44] into the next
[862.44 → 863.96] was just overwhelming.
[865.38 → 867.70] Jesus is the first advocate
[867.70 → 869.32] and he sends another advocate.
[869.78 → 870.86] Jesus is the first
[870.86 → 872.20] because he came alongside us
[872.20 → 872.98] in the incarnation,
[873.24 → 873.88] Christmastime, right?
[873.90 → 874.70] That we might see
[874.70 → 875.52] and live with God.
[875.82 → 876.60] An advocate is one
[876.60 → 877.54] who comes alongside
[877.54 → 879.22] as a source of help.
[880.02 → 880.76] Holy Spirit is sometimes
[880.76 → 883.00] called the helper, right?
[883.46 → 884.88] Advocates are often found,
[885.16 → 886.14] it's a word that's used
[886.14 → 887.14] in court settings.
[888.34 → 889.66] And I want to make sure
[889.66 → 890.40] one thing here.
[890.66 → 891.76] If we move too quickly
[891.76 → 892.58] through John's passage,
[892.68 → 893.36] we might picture
[893.36 → 894.02] that the Spirit
[894.02 → 894.82] who is the advocate
[894.82 → 897.14] might bring our case
[897.14 → 897.78] before God
[897.78 → 898.70] in the hope that God
[898.70 → 899.86] will show mercy to us.
[900.46 → 900.60] Right?
[900.64 → 901.40] He's trying to plead
[901.40 → 902.08] for us that way.
[902.28 → 903.02] But that's really not
[903.02 → 903.62] what's going on here
[903.62 → 904.86] because God has already
[904.86 → 906.42] given us the gift
[906.42 → 907.44] of eternal love
[907.44 → 908.22] through the death
[908.22 → 908.88] and resurrection
[908.88 → 910.14] of the first advocate
[910.14 → 910.82] through Jesus.
[911.92 → 913.56] You don't have to get off
[913.56 → 914.80] the hook of judgment
[914.80 → 916.68] because you already are.
[918.02 → 918.50] Right?
[918.56 → 919.24] That's why we read
[919.24 → 920.36] in Romans 8, 34
[920.36 → 922.30] where we read
[922.30 → 923.12] where Paul writes,
[923.36 → 924.14] who then is the one
[924.14 → 924.92] who condemns.
[925.70 → 926.16] No one.
[927.26 → 928.70] Christ Jesus who died,
[928.80 → 929.40] more than that,
[929.64 → 930.68] who was raised to life,
[930.90 → 932.16] is at the right hand of God
[932.16 → 934.70] and is also interceding for us.
[934.90 → 935.90] He's our first advocate.
[936.96 → 938.74] The Spirit is the advocate
[938.74 → 940.24] who brings us the truth
[940.24 → 941.18] and the love
[941.18 → 942.18] and the life of Jesus
[942.18 → 943.32] and empowers us
[943.32 → 944.58] to live that out.
[947.68 → 948.14] You know,
[948.18 → 948.80] I was reading through
[948.80 → 949.92] Mark's gospel
[949.92 → 950.92] and came across this verse,
[951.02 → 952.28] Mark 13, 11.
[952.28 → 954.30] He said,
[954.30 → 954.90] you know,
[954.90 → 955.86] you read here,
[956.00 → 956.70] Jesus is talking
[956.70 → 957.78] to his followers
[957.78 → 958.32] and he said,
[958.80 → 960.30] whenever you are arrested,
[961.30 → 964.60] somebody started a sentence
[964.60 → 966.28] with that for you.
[967.34 → 968.36] Whenever you're arrested,
[968.78 → 969.48] wait a minute,
[969.84 → 970.68] who said anything
[970.68 → 971.60] about getting arrested here?
[971.60 → 972.24] Yeah,
[972.40 → 974.54] and brought to trial.
[974.84 → 976.44] This is stressing me out.
[976.62 → 977.28] Don't worry.
[979.02 → 979.34] All right,
[979.50 → 980.26] so the whole sentence
[980.26 → 981.50] is loaded against me,
[981.60 → 981.90] at least.
[982.16 → 983.16] I feel like whenever you're arrested
[983.16 → 983.78] and going to trial,
[983.88 → 984.28] don't worry.
[984.38 → 984.52] Well,
[984.72 → 985.66] wait a minute here.
[985.88 → 986.62] What's going on?
[986.98 → 987.92] Don't worry beforehand
[987.92 → 988.70] about what to say.
[988.92 → 990.06] Just say whatever is given
[990.06 → 990.74] to you at the time
[990.74 → 992.18] for it is not you speaking
[992.18 → 992.90] but the Holy Spirit.
[993.16 → 994.30] And we have this picture then
[994.30 → 995.22] of Jesus knowing
[995.22 → 996.54] that things will happen,
[996.82 → 998.16] not pleasant things will happen
[998.16 → 998.92] to these disciples,
[999.04 → 999.46] these followers,
[999.46 → 1002.04] and he will be with them
[1002.04 → 1003.02] through the Spirit
[1003.02 → 1004.24] and he will give them
[1004.24 → 1006.14] the words they need to say
[1006.14 → 1007.26] in a given moment
[1007.26 → 1009.04] because that's what
[1009.04 → 1009.82] the Spirit does.
[1013.00 → 1014.20] 1 Peter 4,
[1014.48 → 1015.66] you know what about
[1015.66 → 1017.40] the spiritual gifts here.
[1017.72 → 1018.96] Each of you should use
[1018.96 → 1021.30] whatever gifts you have received.
[1021.62 → 1022.78] This is different from talent.
[1022.96 → 1023.56] Somehow the Spirit,
[1023.82 → 1025.04] it can involve your talents
[1025.04 → 1027.74] but the Spirit has given you
[1027.74 → 1028.72] a gift of some sort,
[1028.72 → 1029.84] a gift for what?
[1030.10 → 1030.72] You have received
[1030.72 → 1031.96] to serve others.
[1032.58 → 1033.94] So faithfully steward,
[1034.54 → 1036.02] be stewards of God's grace
[1036.02 → 1037.48] in its various forms.
[1038.14 → 1039.42] The Spirit's also called
[1039.42 → 1039.82] the helper.
[1040.22 → 1041.80] And I like that picture too
[1041.80 → 1042.56] because I think
[1042.56 → 1045.04] we are helped by the Spirit
[1045.04 → 1045.84] through guidance
[1045.84 → 1046.46] and so forth
[1046.46 → 1049.08] to become helpers for others.
[1050.52 → 1051.58] I have this picture
[1051.58 → 1052.84] of the helper
[1052.84 → 1054.94] using us to be helpers,
[1055.50 → 1056.14] to serve others.
[1056.14 → 1057.96] It strikes me
[1057.96 → 1058.92] that this group
[1058.92 → 1059.74] of scared,
[1060.16 → 1060.70] confused,
[1060.92 → 1061.92] questioning disciples,
[1062.38 → 1063.48] these guys are the ones
[1063.48 → 1063.94] who go out
[1063.94 → 1064.84] and change the world.
[1067.64 → 1068.90] How did that happen?
[1070.02 → 1070.18] Right?
[1070.58 → 1071.88] Right after this story
[1071.88 → 1072.84] that we read
[1072.84 → 1073.58] with the dinner
[1073.58 → 1074.58] and Jesus saying
[1074.58 → 1075.10] all these words,
[1075.34 → 1075.46] right,
[1075.52 → 1076.24] they go to the garden.
[1077.44 → 1078.18] Jesus said,
[1078.24 → 1078.36] hey,
[1078.48 → 1079.46] why don't you guys pray?
[1079.78 → 1080.76] They all fall asleep.
[1080.76 → 1083.42] Jesus is struggling
[1083.42 → 1084.24] emotionally
[1084.24 → 1085.70] and in his heart
[1085.70 → 1088.18] and then he's arrested
[1088.18 → 1089.98] and all of them run.
[1090.92 → 1091.78] All of them run.
[1092.04 → 1092.94] They all abandon Jesus
[1092.94 → 1093.78] in his greatest moment
[1093.78 → 1094.22] of need.
[1096.74 → 1097.70] And these guys,
[1098.52 → 1099.28] these scared,
[1099.46 → 1099.84] mixed up,
[1099.98 → 1100.80] confused guys
[1100.80 → 1101.92] changed the world
[1101.92 → 1102.94] and many of them
[1102.94 → 1103.60] are martyred
[1103.60 → 1105.00] for that very faith.
[1107.30 → 1108.24] What changed?
[1108.24 → 1110.70] I'm not going to say
[1110.70 → 1111.04] too much
[1111.04 → 1111.90] because I'm jumping ahead
[1111.90 → 1112.62] to some passages
[1112.62 → 1113.94] that Jonathan
[1113.94 → 1114.58] or Dave
[1114.58 → 1115.62] might be talking about
[1115.62 → 1116.40] and I don't want to steal
[1116.40 → 1117.16] any of their thunder
[1117.16 → 1117.48] but,
[1118.56 → 1118.74] eh,
[1119.00 → 1119.60] otherwise they have to
[1119.60 → 1120.32] figure out something else.
[1121.66 → 1122.06] John,
[1122.16 → 1122.50] you know,
[1122.66 → 1123.38] John 20
[1123.38 → 1124.06] kind of gives us
[1124.06 → 1124.40] the picture
[1124.40 → 1125.06] of what's going on
[1125.06 → 1125.66] with these guys.
[1126.02 → 1126.84] After the resurrection,
[1127.02 → 1127.56] Jesus comes
[1127.56 → 1129.06] and again Jesus said,
[1129.18 → 1130.16] peace be with you.
[1130.94 → 1131.50] As the Father
[1131.50 → 1132.28] has sent me,
[1132.38 → 1133.72] I am sending you
[1133.72 → 1135.36] and with that
[1135.36 → 1136.50] he breathed on them
[1136.50 → 1136.88] and said,
[1136.96 → 1137.96] receive the Holy Spirit.
[1138.24 → 1140.02] that's what changed.
[1141.40 → 1142.86] There's the difference.
[1144.36 → 1145.20] The Easter message
[1145.20 → 1146.16] is that life
[1146.16 → 1147.02] rather than death
[1147.02 → 1147.86] has the final word
[1147.86 → 1149.22] and that faith
[1149.22 → 1150.58] is a relationship
[1150.58 → 1152.46] to a living being,
[1152.78 → 1154.20] a being who is not absent
[1154.20 → 1155.32] but deeply present.
[1155.88 → 1156.24] Otherwise,
[1156.74 → 1157.76] faith would be reduced
[1157.76 → 1158.50] to the memory
[1158.50 → 1159.06] of Jesus
[1159.06 → 1160.72] who died long ago
[1160.72 → 1161.94] and he's a great
[1161.94 → 1163.10] moral example.
[1164.98 → 1165.36] I've done,
[1165.62 → 1166.20] you know,
[1166.20 → 1166.94] quite a few funerals
[1166.94 → 1167.56] over my years
[1167.56 → 1168.26] of being a pastor
[1168.26 → 1169.20] and sometimes
[1169.20 → 1169.76] you hear people
[1169.76 → 1170.48] say things like,
[1170.80 → 1170.90] well,
[1170.94 → 1172.54] his memory lives on
[1172.54 → 1175.14] and I get that.
[1175.46 → 1175.62] You know,
[1175.66 → 1176.68] memories are important.
[1176.82 → 1177.54] That matters
[1177.54 → 1179.82] but that's not enough
[1179.82 → 1180.78] by a long shot
[1180.78 → 1181.52] because those memories
[1181.52 → 1182.40] are going to go away too
[1182.40 → 1183.08] and then there's nothing.
[1183.08 → 1184.08] that's not enough
[1184.08 → 1185.62] of being a living God.
[1185.62 → 1187.40] We're not just remembering Jesus.
[1187.86 → 1190.10] We have him in us again
[1190.10 → 1191.10] through the Spirit
[1191.10 → 1191.90] forever
[1191.90 → 1195.02] and we will live as well
[1195.02 → 1195.58] forever
[1195.58 → 1197.22] and so it's not just about
[1197.22 → 1198.82] our memory living on.
[1200.08 → 1200.96] It is the Spirit
[1200.96 → 1201.84] who makes the presence
[1201.84 → 1203.04] of the living Jesus
[1203.04 → 1204.32] and Father known to us
[1204.32 → 1206.26] and that Spirit
[1206.26 → 1207.84] continues the work
[1207.84 → 1208.36] of Jesus'
[1209.22 → 1210.42] love for the world,
[1210.50 → 1210.64] right?
[1210.70 → 1211.66] For God so loved the world
[1211.66 → 1212.64] that he gave his only Son
[1212.64 → 1214.82] and for God so loved the world
[1214.82 → 1215.84] that he could have carried on.
[1216.00 → 1217.10] He gave his only Son
[1217.10 → 1218.00] and then the Son
[1218.00 → 1218.76] sent the Spirit
[1218.76 → 1220.02] because that's how
[1220.02 → 1221.08] the mission's going to go.
[1221.36 → 1222.18] That's how this is going
[1222.18 → 1223.22] to carry on here.
[1226.42 → 1226.88] You know,
[1226.92 → 1227.78] in our passage
[1227.78 → 1230.28] we read how
[1230.28 → 1231.60] love one another
[1231.60 → 1234.12] as I have loved you.
[1236.32 → 1237.74] Let me ask you,
[1238.92 → 1240.94] how many of you
[1240.94 → 1244.14] love exactly
[1244.14 → 1245.06] like Jesus loves?
[1250.06 → 1251.34] I could change the question.
[1251.44 → 1251.98] How many of you
[1251.98 → 1252.60] want to love
[1252.60 → 1253.52] like Jesus loves?
[1254.92 → 1255.22] Yeah,
[1255.54 → 1255.76] you know,
[1255.98 → 1257.90] hopefully that's all of us.
[1258.66 → 1259.04] But you know,
[1259.28 → 1260.18] we get a command,
[1260.62 → 1261.52] love one another
[1261.52 → 1263.30] like Jesus loved.
[1265.56 → 1265.96] Really?
[1266.36 → 1267.80] I can't do that.
[1268.30 → 1268.64] No,
[1268.84 → 1269.58] you can't.
[1269.96 → 1270.28] Why?
[1270.76 → 1270.98] Well,
[1271.06 → 1271.78] you're just a human.
[1272.12 → 1272.92] But what do you need?
[1273.14 → 1273.30] Well,
[1273.32 → 1274.26] you need the Holy Spirit
[1274.26 → 1275.78] to love like that.
[1276.54 → 1277.92] You need God's power
[1277.92 → 1279.20] to love like that.
[1279.50 → 1280.52] You need repentance
[1280.52 → 1282.14] so that you can be forgiven
[1282.14 → 1283.82] when you don't love like that.
[1286.40 → 1287.92] A guy named Bill Coffin wrote,
[1288.34 → 1289.30] if we fail in love,
[1289.38 → 1290.50] we fail in all things else.
[1291.52 → 1293.40] If we fail in love,
[1293.50 → 1294.70] we fail in all things else.
[1298.30 → 1299.24] That line
[1299.24 → 1300.96] in our passage
[1300.96 → 1301.98] where Jesus said,
[1302.08 → 1302.80] you will do
[1302.80 → 1304.70] greater things than me.
[1306.30 → 1307.34] Do you believe that?
[1307.34 → 1310.00] If I came up here
[1310.00 → 1310.50] and said,
[1310.58 → 1310.76] hey,
[1311.72 → 1312.24] I'm Sid,
[1312.90 → 1314.16] I do greater things
[1314.16 → 1314.52] than Jesus.
[1318.12 → 1319.48] I don't think you guys
[1319.48 → 1320.28] would like me saying
[1320.28 → 1321.14] this kind of things,
[1321.18 → 1321.50] would you?
[1321.62 → 1322.16] You know,
[1322.18 → 1322.86] because it sounds
[1322.86 → 1323.48] pretty cocky.
[1324.02 → 1324.90] Jesus is saying
[1324.90 → 1326.70] that about us.
[1327.70 → 1328.64] You will do
[1328.64 → 1329.46] greater things
[1329.46 → 1330.80] than me.
[1330.80 → 1331.84] What does he mean?
[1332.46 → 1332.62] You know,
[1332.66 → 1333.22] and there are all kinds
[1333.22 → 1333.92] of things we can think
[1333.92 → 1334.30] about there.
[1334.30 → 1335.76] But Jesus,
[1336.00 → 1337.02] the good shepherd,
[1337.30 → 1338.58] he knows that there's
[1338.58 → 1340.06] sheep out there
[1340.06 → 1341.12] that aren't in the flock yet
[1341.12 → 1342.14] and he wants them
[1342.14 → 1343.20] all in the flock.
[1343.86 → 1344.80] He wants them all
[1344.80 → 1345.98] to know his love.
[1346.44 → 1348.40] That's what the disciples did.
[1348.84 → 1349.94] They brought and displayed
[1349.94 → 1350.94] the love of Christ.
[1351.22 → 1351.46] Where?
[1351.68 → 1352.32] To Jerusalem,
[1352.68 → 1353.38] to Samaria,
[1353.82 → 1355.18] to the ends of the earth.
[1355.40 → 1356.26] That's the mission.
[1356.54 → 1357.98] That's the greater things.
[1357.98 → 1362.48] You know,
[1362.52 → 1363.76] if you look at numbers
[1363.76 → 1365.60] in terms of people
[1365.60 → 1366.86] that connected to Jesus
[1366.86 → 1367.64] when he was alive,
[1367.88 → 1369.62] it's not that big.
[1370.96 → 1372.68] But Jesus' game plan
[1372.68 → 1373.86] was to say,
[1374.08 → 1374.72] I'm going to send
[1374.72 → 1375.82] my spirit into them
[1375.82 → 1376.54] and they're going
[1376.54 → 1377.30] to go out into the world,
[1377.36 → 1377.88] they're going to go out
[1377.88 → 1378.10] into the world,
[1378.18 → 1378.62] then they're going
[1378.62 → 1379.10] to go out into the world,
[1379.16 → 1379.58] then they're going
[1379.58 → 1380.00] to go out into the world
[1380.00 → 1381.10] and the whole world
[1381.10 → 1382.16] will know the love of Christ.
[1382.46 → 1383.56] That's the game plan.
[1383.56 → 1383.62] That's the game plan.
[1387.98 → 1389.44] That's the greater things
[1389.44 → 1390.24] we're invited to do.
[1394.34 → 1395.46] We are called
[1395.46 → 1396.24] and empowered
[1396.24 → 1397.58] to do those greater things.
[1401.80 → 1402.56] And then we get
[1402.56 → 1403.32] to verse 27
[1403.32 → 1404.16] where we read,
[1404.74 → 1405.18] Jesus says,
[1405.34 → 1406.56] Peace, I leave you.
[1407.58 → 1408.92] My peace, I give you.
[1409.38 → 1409.92] I don't give
[1409.92 → 1410.92] as the world gives.
[1411.52 → 1412.46] Let not your hearts
[1412.46 → 1413.10] be troubled
[1413.10 → 1415.52] and do not be afraid.
[1417.24 → 1417.46] You know,
[1417.98 → 1418.60] and yeah,
[1418.94 → 1419.70] if you look at the lives
[1419.70 → 1420.20] of the disciples,
[1420.34 → 1421.34] they had lots of troubles.
[1422.48 → 1422.60] You know,
[1422.66 → 1424.00] so Christ sending them out
[1424.00 → 1425.34] didn't mean a lack of trouble.
[1426.02 → 1427.50] And so what's going on here?
[1427.92 → 1429.62] He's giving them peace.
[1429.72 → 1431.54] Notice he's not wishing them peace.
[1431.78 → 1432.62] What do we tend to do?
[1432.86 → 1433.56] Oh, peace.
[1433.68 → 1433.78] You know,
[1433.84 → 1434.18] in other words,
[1434.34 → 1435.78] feel contentment all the time.
[1436.46 → 1436.62] Don't,
[1436.96 → 1437.56] hopefully nothing
[1437.56 → 1438.60] ruffles your world.
[1438.98 → 1439.78] That's the peace
[1439.78 → 1440.78] we talk about in the world.
[1440.98 → 1441.84] That's not the peace
[1441.84 → 1443.26] we're talking about here at all.
[1443.58 → 1444.70] The peace he gives
[1444.70 → 1445.82] is a peace
[1445.82 → 1447.70] that holds us together
[1447.70 → 1448.18] together
[1448.18 → 1450.04] in God's mission
[1450.04 → 1451.96] in the midst
[1451.96 → 1452.76] of struggles
[1452.76 → 1453.68] and in the midst
[1453.68 → 1454.46] of troubles.
[1457.64 → 1458.46] We have,
[1459.42 → 1459.64] you know,
[1459.88 → 1461.42] it's like Psalm 23.
[1462.38 → 1462.88] God says,
[1462.96 → 1464.10] I prepare a table
[1464.10 → 1464.78] before you.
[1465.18 → 1466.18] A table before you
[1466.18 → 1466.40] where?
[1466.64 → 1467.44] In the presence
[1467.44 → 1468.20] of your enemies.
[1468.40 → 1469.90] In the middle of the mess,
[1469.90 → 1471.48] I meet you there.
[1474.24 → 1475.20] If you're waiting
[1475.20 → 1476.68] for it all to settle down
[1476.68 → 1477.56] and then you and God
[1477.56 → 1478.12] will have this great
[1478.12 → 1478.76] love relationship,
[1479.28 → 1480.58] that's not how this goes.
[1482.16 → 1483.28] The settling down
[1483.28 → 1484.04] is here
[1484.04 → 1485.54] and that connection
[1485.54 → 1486.28] with the Spirit
[1486.28 → 1486.70] and God,
[1486.96 → 1487.80] that's here.
[1490.74 → 1491.74] And it happens
[1491.74 → 1493.22] in the midst
[1493.22 → 1493.96] of hope.
[1498.96 → 1500.16] Jesus is praying
[1500.16 → 1501.68] for his disciples
[1501.68 → 1502.76] on their journey
[1502.76 → 1503.98] and he gives them
[1503.98 → 1504.92] a peace
[1504.92 → 1506.04] which is not,
[1506.92 → 1507.68] it's a gift,
[1508.02 → 1509.12] it's an essential,
[1509.54 → 1511.26] it's part of an identity
[1511.26 → 1512.10] of a disciple
[1512.10 → 1513.88] and it isn't a passive peace,
[1513.96 → 1514.94] it's an active peace
[1514.94 → 1516.32] that propels Jesus' followers
[1516.32 → 1518.16] into active discipleship
[1518.16 → 1518.52] and love.
[1522.94 → 1524.14] I heard of one guy
[1524.14 → 1524.72] who had a mantra
[1524.72 → 1525.28] that says,
[1525.92 → 1526.94] breathe in peace,
[1528.38 → 1529.26] breathe out love.
[1530.16 → 1531.18] Breathe in peace,
[1532.32 → 1533.00] breathe out love.
[1533.92 → 1534.66] And I was thinking
[1534.66 → 1535.16] about that,
[1535.24 → 1535.36] you know,
[1535.38 → 1536.88] because when you have peace
[1536.88 → 1539.04] then you're not distracted
[1539.04 → 1540.22] by all the stuff,
[1540.96 → 1542.24] all the craziness
[1542.24 → 1542.66] of it all.
[1543.02 → 1544.00] You have peace,
[1544.08 → 1545.16] you're focused on Christ
[1545.16 → 1546.16] and then,
[1546.32 → 1547.48] somehow you'll find love
[1547.48 → 1548.24] to give
[1548.24 → 1549.22] through the power
[1549.22 → 1549.78] of the Spirit.
[1550.48 → 1551.28] Breathe that peace
[1551.28 → 1551.50] and,
[1551.60 → 1552.64] all right,
[1552.68 → 1552.92] all right,
[1553.16 → 1553.64] now I know,
[1553.70 → 1554.26] now I can love,
[1554.48 → 1555.34] now I can care,
[1555.42 → 1556.16] now I can serve.
[1559.58 → 1560.28] It is the peace
[1560.28 → 1561.44] that comes from
[1561.44 → 1562.24] knowing the Spirit
[1562.24 → 1563.14] within us
[1563.14 → 1564.34] and with us.
[1565.70 → 1566.56] And then the chapter
[1566.56 → 1567.68] ends with,
[1568.58 → 1569.10] come now,
[1569.40 → 1570.12] let us leave.
[1571.16 → 1571.94] A fascinating way
[1571.94 → 1572.38] to end.
[1573.08 → 1574.02] One version says,
[1574.14 → 1574.56] rise up,
[1574.62 → 1575.00] let's go.
[1576.32 → 1576.50] So,
[1576.94 → 1578.16] we have this moment,
[1578.46 → 1579.48] we have this table talk
[1579.48 → 1580.24] and,
[1580.38 → 1580.56] okay,
[1580.72 → 1581.00] all right,
[1581.22 → 1582.36] I'm reassuring you
[1582.36 → 1583.34] and now,
[1583.60 → 1583.74] okay,
[1583.86 → 1584.66] let's go.
[1585.70 → 1586.54] Let's get moving here.
[1586.94 → 1587.98] There's a mission here
[1587.98 → 1588.60] for Christ,
[1588.88 → 1590.32] it's the road to the cross,
[1590.80 → 1590.98] right,
[1591.02 → 1591.60] it's all of that.
[1591.88 → 1592.44] For the disciple,
[1592.66 → 1594.04] it's experiencing all that
[1594.04 → 1595.36] and then it's getting
[1595.36 → 1596.54] the Spirit sent
[1596.54 → 1597.78] and then it's being sent out.
[1597.98 → 1598.34] Let's go,
[1598.44 → 1599.06] let's move on,
[1599.20 → 1599.96] let's carry on.
[1599.96 → 1602.96] It's interesting,
[1603.40 → 1604.58] it's where the leaving
[1604.58 → 1606.30] is the beginning.
[1607.68 → 1608.64] And I picture that
[1608.64 → 1609.86] for a church service too.
[1611.42 → 1611.84] You know,
[1611.86 → 1612.48] when we bless you
[1612.48 → 1612.98] to leave,
[1613.88 → 1614.66] it's the beginning
[1614.66 → 1616.26] of carrying out
[1616.26 → 1616.98] the mission of God
[1616.98 → 1617.94] in the week ahead,
[1618.06 → 1618.72] whatever that might mean
[1618.72 → 1619.08] for you.
[1621.74 → 1622.70] And in all of this,
[1622.76 → 1623.26] Jesus says,
[1623.70 → 1624.24] trust me,
[1625.14 → 1625.98] trust the presence
[1625.98 → 1626.74] that is with you
[1626.74 → 1627.22] and in you.
[1627.90 → 1629.16] Go with that peace
[1629.16 → 1629.98] that is a gift
[1629.98 → 1631.56] and go with all,
[1631.70 → 1632.92] let that peace be with you
[1632.92 → 1633.78] in all your questions
[1633.78 → 1634.58] and all your concerns
[1634.58 → 1635.26] and all your worries
[1635.26 → 1636.10] because know that
[1636.10 → 1636.80] I'm with you always.
[1637.16 → 1638.34] And know you're not orphans
[1638.34 → 1640.06] and know that you are sheep
[1640.06 → 1641.04] who has a good shepherd
[1641.04 → 1642.02] with you all the time.
[1642.28 → 1643.70] And know that you're a branch
[1643.70 → 1644.86] but remind yourself
[1644.86 → 1645.48] you're a branch
[1645.48 → 1646.40] that needs to bind.
[1654.76 → 1656.00] We're going to have communion now.
[1657.22 → 1660.04] For the next four weeks
[1660.04 → 1662.16] for the season of Lent
[1662.16 → 1663.02] we'll have communion.
[1664.26 → 1665.12] And this time
[1665.12 → 1666.22] we're going to have
[1666.22 → 1668.04] you remain seated
[1668.04 → 1669.80] and communion
[1669.80 → 1670.66] is going to be served.
[1671.04 → 1671.84] And my intention
[1671.84 → 1672.90] for this was
[1672.90 → 1674.26] to give you
[1674.26 → 1676.56] a sense
[1676.56 → 1678.02] I'll sit here.
[1678.14 → 1679.48] I thought I should be seated too.
[1680.58 → 1681.30] That we're sitting
[1681.30 → 1681.86] just,
[1681.98 → 1682.38] I know it's
[1682.38 → 1683.66] a little bit of a stretch
[1683.66 → 1684.68] but we're sitting
[1684.68 → 1685.40] around the table
[1685.40 → 1685.94] with Jesus.
[1687.22 → 1688.24] Right?
[1688.38 → 1689.46] We're sitting together
[1689.46 → 1690.74] around a table
[1690.74 → 1691.28] with Jesus.
[1692.30 → 1692.42] And
[1692.42 → 1697.68] you come with your losses
[1697.68 → 1699.84] and you come with your questions
[1699.84 → 1700.84] and you come with your fears
[1700.84 → 1702.02] just like the disciples did.
[1702.68 → 1703.54] And you come
[1703.54 → 1704.70] with pain
[1704.70 → 1705.46] or suffering
[1705.46 → 1706.14] or isolation
[1706.14 → 1706.80] or struggles
[1706.80 → 1707.42] with addictions
[1707.42 → 1708.86] or worries about the wars
[1708.86 → 1709.94] or relational stuff
[1709.94 → 1711.50] or all kinds of things.
[1711.86 → 1713.10] And all those questions too.
[1713.10 → 1714.82] And we want answers
[1714.82 → 1715.78] and we come with these questions.
[1715.92 → 1716.24] How?
[1716.44 → 1716.72] Why?
[1716.86 → 1717.12] When?
[1717.24 → 1717.52] Where?
[1717.62 → 1717.88] Who?
[1718.18 → 1719.26] We come with these questions
[1719.26 → 1720.50] and then Jesus says
[1720.50 → 1721.66] and this is what we're doing communion.
[1722.00 → 1722.64] Jesus says
[1722.64 → 1723.74] here's the answer.
[1725.40 → 1725.76] Me.
[1729.34 → 1729.82] Me.
[1730.76 → 1731.20] How?
[1731.94 → 1732.42] Me.
[1733.18 → 1733.62] When?
[1734.50 → 1734.96] Me.
[1735.56 → 1736.00] Why?
[1736.00 → 1736.16] Me.
[1736.16 → 1737.36] Me.
[1738.26 → 1738.66] Me.
[1738.66 → 1740.76] Me.
[1740.76 → 1745.66] My body.
[1746.70 → 1747.58] My blood.
[1748.36 → 1750.18] So you can have my spirit
[1750.18 → 1751.38] with you
[1751.38 → 1752.42] and in you always.
[1752.84 → 1753.48] So you can know
[1753.48 → 1754.18] the oneness
[1754.18 → 1755.18] that God intended.
[1755.34 → 1756.30] The oneness of the Father
[1756.30 → 1756.70] the Son
[1756.70 → 1757.46] and the Holy Spirit.
[1757.58 → 1758.48] The oneness we have
[1758.48 → 1759.18] with one another.
[1759.62 → 1760.30] So you can know
[1760.30 → 1761.76] peace beyond understanding.
[1762.26 → 1763.64] So you can join
[1763.64 → 1764.98] the Holy Helper
[1764.98 → 1765.96] in a world
[1765.96 → 1766.40] needing
[1766.40 → 1767.48] so much
[1767.48 → 1768.18] help.
[1770.76 → 1772.46] So let's have
[1772.46 → 1773.14] communion together.
[1774.88 → 1775.96] Let's sit at the table
[1775.96 → 1776.68] knowing Jesus
[1776.68 → 1777.72] looks you in the eye
[1777.72 → 1778.14] and he says
[1778.14 → 1778.90] it's about me
[1778.90 → 1781.22] and then it's about you
[1781.22 → 1782.26] being filled with him.
[1794.26 → 1794.66] Jesus
[1794.66 → 1797.40] who said this
[1797.40 → 1797.88] you know
[1797.88 → 1799.18] in all these images
[1799.18 → 1802.14] images of orphans
[1802.14 → 1802.82] images of sheep
[1802.82 → 1803.56] without a shepherd
[1803.56 → 1804.52] or images
[1804.52 → 1805.76] of you're just a branch
[1805.76 → 1807.92] unless you're connected
[1807.92 → 1808.52] to me.
[1809.90 → 1810.60] And Jesus said
[1810.60 → 1811.02] you know
[1811.02 → 1812.64] this is my body.
[1814.00 → 1815.22] This is my body
[1815.22 → 1816.40] and my body
[1816.40 → 1818.10] it needs to be broken.
[1818.28 → 1819.30] Why does it need
[1819.30 → 1819.96] to be broken?
[1820.22 → 1821.68] Because that's the path
[1821.68 → 1822.52] for wholeness
[1822.52 → 1823.12] for you.
[1825.56 → 1826.64] That's the path
[1826.64 → 1827.66] for my spirit
[1827.66 → 1829.94] to enter you.
[1832.30 → 1834.24] I invite the elders
[1834.24 → 1834.86] and deacons
[1834.86 → 1835.74] to come forward
[1835.74 → 1837.82] and serve you.
[1839.52 → 1840.50] And you'll notice
[1840.50 → 1841.46] there will be some images
[1841.46 → 1842.30] on the screen
[1842.30 → 1843.70] and those images
[1843.70 → 1844.78] are created
[1844.78 → 1847.00] by a team of people here
[1847.00 → 1848.00] and they're there
[1848.00 → 1849.14] for you to reflect on.
[1849.52 → 1850.42] Listen to the music
[1850.42 → 1852.36] look at the table
[1852.36 → 1853.86] picture yourself
[1853.86 → 1854.52] as a branch
[1854.52 → 1855.80] somehow reflect.
[1855.80 → 1871.14] plastic containers.
[1871.14 → 1871.82] a little verse.
[1872.20 → 1872.82] ...
[1872.82 → 1874.16] ...
[1878.16 → 1886.30] ...
[1886.30 → 1890.84] ...
[1890.84 → 1920.82] PIANO PLAYS
[1920.84 → 1950.82] PIANO PLAYS
[1950.84 → 1980.82] PIANO PLAYS
[1980.84 → 2010.82] PIANO PLAYS
[2010.84 → 2040.82] PIANO PLAYS
[2040.82 → 2070.80] PIANO PLAYS
[2070.80 → 2072.80] PIANO PLAYS
[2072.80 → 2084.96] People, God deeply loves.
[2086.80 → 2089.88] God longs to be one with you.
[2089.88 → 2096.56] He gave his body, he gave his blood so you might receive his spirit.
[2098.02 → 2098.34] Eat.
[2100.34 → 2107.74] Take, eat, remember, and believe that because of Christ, you are one with the Father.
[2107.74 → 2136.20] Jesus also took wine at the table and at the cup, and he poured it out.
[2136.20 → 2140.66] And he said, this is my blood.
[2140.66 → 2149.74] And this blood washes away all that brokenness, all that loss, all that messiness.
[2149.74 → 2155.20] It washes away all that pain, and it washes away all that anxiety and all that worry.
[2155.20 → 2161.78] And it replaces all of that with his presence.
[2161.78 → 2168.92] I invite the again, the elders and the deacons to serve you in this time.
[2168.92 → 2174.60] God, I feel with Him.
[2174.60 → 2175.72] God gotta give it now.
[2175.72 → 2176.82] God damn God.
[2177.32 → 2180.28] May I ask Him for you as well as me as the Son will be aside.
[2180.28 → 2181.98] God damn it.
[2181.98 → 2183.60] God am I.
[2183.60 → 2186.46] Can have my heart.
[2186.46 → 2188.58] New earth and theology reign.
[2188.58 → 2218.56] Thank you.
[2218.58 → 2248.56] Thank you.
[2248.58 → 2278.56] Thank you.
[2278.58 → 2308.56] Thank you.
[2308.58 → 2338.56] Thank you.
[2338.58 → 2368.56] Thank you.
[2368.58 → 2398.56] Thank you.
[2398.56 → 2400.56] Thank you.
[2400.56 → 2405.56] Thank you.
[2405.56 → 2406.56] Thank you.
[2406.56 → 2407.56] Thank you.
[2407.56 → 2409.56] Thank you.
[2409.56 → 2410.56] Thank you.
[2410.56 → 2411.56] Let's pray.
[2411.56 → 2412.92] Let's pray.
[2412.92 → 2413.92] Father God,
[2413.92 → 2421.12] Father God, we've come before you, Lord, and thank you for that, Lord, that we can know we are not orphans.
[2421.92 → 2423.54] You haven't abandoned us.
[2423.64 → 2424.74] You haven't left us.
[2424.92 → 2430.24] You died for us, and you rose again so that we might have forgiveness and life.
[2430.24 → 2458.06] May we pray for you, Lord, may we pray for you, Lord, may we pray for you, Lord, may we pray for this world, that this world might know your love and that you might use us to bring your great love to the world around us.
[2458.86 → 2459.22] We praise you, Lord, we praise you, Lord, and thank you, Lord, and we praise you.
[2459.22 → 2463.42] We praise you, we thank you, Lord Jesus, that you love us so much.
[2463.98 → 2464.94] In your name we pray.
[2464.94 → 2465.06] Amen.
