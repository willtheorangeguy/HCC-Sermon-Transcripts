[0.00 → 4.02] Good morning.
[6.96 → 15.96] It's good to gather yet again and be reminded that we are a people as God gathers us together
[15.96 → 16.68] as his people.
[18.44 → 21.88] Let's jump right into our message on John's gospel.
[21.88 → 25.12] We are coming to the end of it.
[25.12 → 31.96] Last week, Pastor Dave preached on John 20, where we see what happens right after the
[31.96 → 32.40] resurrection.
[33.88 → 42.08] Pastor Dave described it as recalibrating relationships and how Jesus goes personally to Mary and the
[42.08 → 43.58] disciples and to Thomas.
[43.58 → 49.70] And he goes to their places of deepest struggle, their fears, their doubts, betrayals, their
[49.70 → 50.06] grief.
[50.06 → 57.08] And Jesus then breathes life, the life of the spirit into those struggling followers.
[58.08 → 64.14] And we see how the resurrection enters into the reality of their lives and ours.
[65.42 → 72.06] And then we read in John 20, 30 through 31 there, we read, Jesus performed many other
[72.06 → 76.38] signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.
[76.38 → 81.16] But these are written that you may believe in Jesus, the Messiah, that Jesus is the Messiah,
[81.28 → 85.24] the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
[86.54 → 90.36] And I don't know if it strikes you, but it strikes me here that this would be a very logical
[90.36 → 93.72] place for John to end his gospel.
[94.62 → 98.20] It just feels like, okay, good, done, we're finished.
[98.74 → 100.04] But that's not what happens.
[100.14 → 101.84] We have chapter 21.
[101.84 → 107.68] And so I'm going to talk a little bit about chapter 21 and why it seems to be added on.
[107.90 → 109.18] At least that's what it feels like.
[109.50 → 110.62] And so let's look at it together.
[110.80 → 114.24] So from John 20 to chapter 21 here, we read this.
[115.00 → 120.04] Afterward, Jesus appeared again to his disciples by the Sea of Galilee.
[120.54 → 122.06] And it happened this way.
[122.16 → 127.64] Simon Peter, Thomas, also known as Didymous, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee
[127.64 → 129.66] and the two other disciples were together.
[129.66 → 132.74] Peter, I'm going out to fish, Simon Peter told them.
[133.64 → 136.00] And they said, well, we're going to go with you.
[136.08 → 138.34] So they went and got into the boat.
[138.46 → 140.50] But that night they caught nothing.
[141.40 → 146.28] Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples didn't realize it was Jesus.
[147.50 → 149.88] He called out to them, friends, have you any fish?
[150.92 → 151.72] No, they answered.
[152.46 → 156.20] He said, well, throw your nets on the right side of the boat and you'll find some.
[156.20 → 160.96] And when they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.
[161.44 → 165.22] And then the disciple, whom Jesus loved, said to Peter, it's the Lord.
[166.42 → 173.12] As soon as Simon heard him say, it is the Lord, he wrapped his outer garment around him for he had taken it off and jumped into the water.
[173.50 → 174.78] Very Peter style.
[174.78 → 182.84] The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about 100 yards.
[183.20 → 188.36] And when they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with the fish on it and some bread.
[188.44 → 191.72] And Jesus said to them, bring some of the fish you have just caught.
[192.38 → 195.18] So Simon climbed back into the boat, dragged the net ashore.
[195.44 → 197.84] It was full of large fish, 153.
[198.34 → 201.28] But even with so many, the net was not torn.
[201.28 → 204.66] And Jesus said to them, come and have breakfast.
[205.64 → 207.96] None of the disciples dared to ask him, who are you?
[208.20 → 209.28] They knew it was the Lord.
[209.56 → 212.36] And Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them.
[212.56 → 213.98] And then did the same with the fish.
[214.62 → 220.58] And this was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.
[222.14 → 227.46] Now as I said to you, chapter 21 here feels like a bit of a in a way of an odd add-on.
[227.46 → 233.48] John 20, we have resurrection appearances, the recalibrating of relationships with the followers.
[233.90 → 236.24] I mean, why add chapter 21?
[237.50 → 240.32] We shift locations to the Sea of Galilee.
[240.84 → 245.50] It has to be a place I've been, and we can see a picture of, hopefully it comes up here.
[245.86 → 251.12] That's my wife and I on the Sea of Galilee on a trip that we went to, to Israel.
[251.12 → 257.28] And I remember looking out on that Sea of Galilee and just picturing Jesus walking on the water.
[257.82 → 261.40] Or trying to picture the stories of Jesus speaking to crowds on the shores.
[262.10 → 267.32] And now this story, on this shore of this lake, it's an actual place, right?
[267.38 → 270.48] You know, sometimes we read the Bible like it's, it's not real.
[270.58 → 271.54] It's a real place.
[271.82 → 278.56] On this shore of this lake, Jesus shares a breakfast with his disciples with the invitation, come and eat.
[278.56 → 287.08] We're going to have communion this morning together, but we're going to have, instead of the last supper, we're going to have the last breakfast.
[287.60 → 289.14] And I'll talk a little bit more about that.
[290.18 → 297.52] It's interesting how John really wants to spend time reporting what Jesus is up to after the resurrection.
[298.36 → 303.68] When you look at the other gospels, Matthew gives five verses to it after the resurrection.
[304.16 → 305.68] Mark, zero verses.
[306.30 → 307.36] Luke, four verses.
[307.36 → 311.70] John devotes a couple of chapters talking about what Jesus is up to.
[312.22 → 317.04] And he ends with Jesus tending a campfire on a beach frying fish.
[319.62 → 320.82] I mean, I get that.
[320.98 → 322.86] You know, it's a wonderful thing to fry fish.
[323.16 → 329.00] And, you know, I remember sitting on the shores of Lake, Malone Lake in Jasper.
[329.06 → 330.08] Maybe some of you have been there.
[330.34 → 332.20] With a good friend of mine, Peter Vulcan here.
[332.20 → 335.26] And he was a big fisherman.
[335.46 → 336.62] And he took me along.
[336.84 → 338.16] And we caught some trout.
[338.36 → 339.56] Went right on to the shore.
[339.80 → 340.68] Got a fire going.
[340.94 → 341.88] Fried up those fish.
[342.02 → 345.62] Oh, you know, it tastes amazing when you eat them right like that.
[345.80 → 346.88] So they're having this fish fry.
[347.16 → 350.18] But is this, you know, I get the joy of that moment.
[350.34 → 352.36] But is this what life looks like after Easter?
[353.88 → 354.14] Right?
[354.26 → 355.56] The resurrection has happened.
[356.00 → 357.26] Yet Herod's still around.
[357.44 → 358.48] Rome's still in charge.
[358.82 → 360.88] Pilate's still sitting there in Jerusalem.
[362.72 → 364.00] What's changed?
[365.60 → 368.66] Here Jesus is calling out, hey, have you caught any fish?
[370.02 → 371.24] Come have breakfast.
[372.98 → 376.58] I mean, you might say, hey, Jesus, go deal with Rome.
[378.76 → 380.14] Stop that nonsense.
[383.86 → 384.86] What's going on here?
[384.86 → 389.14] And John tells us the catch is 153 fish.
[390.46 → 394.00] You know, you think, okay, is this one of those fish stories, right?
[394.98 → 396.70] You know, you ask a lot of people, right?
[396.76 → 397.66] You know, a lot of fishermen.
[398.14 → 401.04] I remember Pete often said, you know, I said, Pete, how big was the fish?
[401.08 → 401.96] And he'd go like this.
[403.30 → 405.44] Leaving you to imagine how big it might be.
[406.04 → 407.60] Never like this, just like this.
[408.32 → 408.66] Right?
[408.70 → 410.90] It was, well, huge.
[410.90 → 413.28] And I get it.
[413.36 → 416.34] You know, and it's interesting, this 153.
[416.54 → 419.52] You know, there's some, a lot of speculation.
[419.86 → 421.46] John does a lot with symbols.
[421.72 → 424.08] And there are a lot of threes and sevens.
[424.18 → 425.84] And we get symbols of completeness.
[425.92 → 426.96] And all that's there, too.
[427.04 → 431.24] But Professor Dale Brunei spoke of Augustine.
[431.80 → 433.08] Augustine figured it out this way.
[433.12 → 434.12] Why 153?
[434.24 → 436.28] And he said, well, I'm going to solve this mystery.
[436.74 → 438.68] And so he said, well, there are 10 commandments.
[439.10 → 440.88] And then there's seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.
[441.16 → 442.40] You add them together, you get 17.
[442.84 → 446.78] And then if you go add up the one plus the two plus the three plus the four plus the five,
[447.04 → 448.42] all good to 17, you add that up.
[448.78 → 449.86] Guess what you get?
[452.22 → 452.54] 153.
[452.54 → 452.98] Right?
[456.06 → 461.18] And it's like, well, I think, personally think Augustine was trying too hard at this point.
[462.40 → 467.82] I think the significance is, one, fishermen count their fish.
[468.70 → 470.52] That would be certainly true.
[472.34 → 474.52] I think Jesus is showing us abundance.
[476.02 → 476.54] Abundance.
[477.18 → 477.34] Right?
[477.84 → 478.90] It's miraculous.
[479.04 → 480.52] This whole story is quite miraculous, right?
[480.52 → 482.60] You know, throw your nets on the other side.
[482.68 → 486.26] Because, you know, when I fish over here on this side of the boat, actually the fish are all on this side, right?
[486.56 → 487.50] No, that's not how it goes.
[487.64 → 492.48] You know, Jesus does a miracle in the presence of the disciples.
[492.78 → 496.24] And we are reminded that Jesus brings blessing.
[496.42 → 497.60] Jesus brings abundance.
[498.24 → 499.36] You know, 153 fish.
[499.62 → 504.56] Not as spectacular as feeding 5,000 with two fish and some bread.
[504.74 → 507.82] Because surely that's what the disciples must be remembering, too.
[507.82 → 510.02] This time there's only seven to feed.
[510.10 → 510.72] Not that big a deal.
[511.02 → 512.12] 153 is a bit overkill.
[513.82 → 515.48] It's not Jesus' biggest miracle.
[515.68 → 522.84] But surely the disciples are remembering right that moment, you know, when the crowd was fed with just a couple of fish and bread.
[523.06 → 527.38] And there's just, you just picture them trying to make sense of what's going on here.
[528.68 → 531.02] Peter, you know, had gone back to what he knows.
[531.10 → 532.08] He knows fishing.
[532.20 → 533.12] He said, I'm going fishing.
[533.12 → 535.44] And the guy says, yeah, we're going to join you.
[535.90 → 540.06] You know, and I see this in times of uncertainty.
[540.48 → 542.34] In times when you kind of don't know where you stand.
[542.46 → 543.86] Where you don't know what's going on.
[544.20 → 546.48] Then we go to what we know.
[547.44 → 551.24] We go to that place where we say, well, I'm in control now.
[551.36 → 552.30] I get this.
[552.36 → 554.64] I can understand how this world works.
[555.00 → 555.74] I know this world.
[555.96 → 557.44] So I'm going to stay here and do that.
[557.44 → 561.92] Because he doesn't know where he stands right now.
[563.50 → 565.76] And now we have this failed fishing trip.
[567.14 → 569.42] Nothing after fishing all night.
[570.06 → 573.64] And then Jesus turns it into this miraculous abundance because Jesus is there.
[573.98 → 577.96] And this mirrors other stories of abundance like the wine at Cana.
[578.08 → 578.88] All that wine.
[579.24 → 582.42] Or the 12 baskets of leftovers after feeding the 5,000.
[582.42 → 587.70] And Jesus had asked them if they'd caught anything knowing full well they'd caught nothing.
[588.96 → 589.98] Why do you do that?
[590.12 → 596.08] Because he wants them to acknowledge their insufficiency in order to appreciate the abundance.
[598.66 → 602.10] Andreas Rosenberg observed this, and I quote,
[602.80 → 608.32] Remarkably the disciples never catch a fish in any of the gospels without Jesus' help.
[610.30 → 611.80] Would that mean they didn't ever catch fish?
[611.80 → 612.48] No, no, no.
[612.68 → 613.52] In the gospel stories.
[613.58 → 618.72] The only stories that involve fish are ones where they're not catching them and Jesus is there and then they do.
[621.02 → 626.56] Disciples needed to be reminded of Jesus' words about bearing fruit in his kingdom.
[626.56 → 633.06] Apart from me, you can do nothing.
[635.40 → 636.24] Nothing.
[636.96 → 638.88] Nothing that is life-giving.
[638.88 → 649.70] And the truth is, we can only trust Christ to the extent that we recognize our own insufficiency and his all-sufficiency.
[650.58 → 654.54] You won't need a saviour if you don't need saving.
[654.54 → 662.70] You won't need a resurrected saviour if you don't need a resurrected life.
[662.70 → 669.24] Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 3, 5.
[670.24 → 670.98] He writes this,
[671.42 → 677.82] Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything that's coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God.
[678.08 → 683.12] And he sees his ministry and all the work he's doing as God's work through them.
[683.34 → 686.30] It was about God's sufficiency, not Paul's.
[686.30 → 689.42] And the disciples needed to be reminded of that.
[689.70 → 692.70] But notice Jesus doesn't just get the fish to jump into the boat.
[694.22 → 694.40] Right?
[694.50 → 697.50] Suddenly the boat's just filling up with fish and the disciples just have to get out of the way.
[697.84 → 701.00] Somehow, Jesus wants them involved in what he's up to.
[701.10 → 703.32] And so, yeah, they have to haul in the nets.
[703.38 → 706.54] They have to get busy with what Jesus has done.
[707.08 → 714.70] He wants us in on his resurrection mission to save the world and to bring healing to the world and life to the world.
[714.70 → 722.08] And this incident would surely have reminded each of them of another time.
[722.92 → 725.04] I'm going to read that other time to you because it sounds so familiar.
[725.14 → 726.22] Luke 5, look at it with me.
[726.48 → 729.44] This is the other time, early in the ministry of Jesus here.
[730.62 → 732.98] When he, Jesus, had finished speaking, he said to Simon,
[733.12 → 736.24] Put out the deep water and let the nets out for a catch.
[736.34 → 737.10] And Simon answered,
[737.28 → 742.48] Master, we've worked all night and haven't caught anything, but because you say so, I'll let the nets down.
[742.48 → 747.26] And when they had done so, they caught such many fish that the nets began to break.
[747.66 → 751.00] So they signalled their partners in another boat to come over and help them.
[751.08 → 753.88] And they came in, and they filled up both boats so full they began to sink.
[754.32 → 758.18] And when Simon Peter, this fisherman, saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said,
[758.30 → 759.16] Go away from me, Lord.
[759.32 → 760.68] I am a sinful man.
[764.04 → 766.40] He understands the moment, doesn't he?
[766.40 → 769.44] I am an insufficient man.
[770.86 → 774.94] For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken.
[775.28 → 778.10] And so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners.
[778.46 → 779.64] And then Jesus said to Simon,
[779.96 → 783.12] Don't be afraid, from now on you will fish for people.
[784.14 → 786.78] And so they pulled their nets, their boats up on the shore,
[787.04 → 790.66] and they left everything and followed him.
[790.66 → 799.12] And you get the impression, and now that we jump ahead to this moment of another big fishing call,
[799.44 → 803.04] you get that Jesus is reinstating them.
[803.18 → 807.52] Because they are living their lives now without a sense of purpose.
[808.76 → 811.84] They're no longer living into this call to be fishers of men.
[812.04 → 815.02] They don't know what life is after the resurrection here.
[815.02 → 818.10] And it's such a tendency for us to keep it safe.
[818.40 → 821.34] Stay what you know where you feel in control.
[821.60 → 824.72] Especially when things haven't gone particularly well.
[827.64 → 831.80] Notice this time, of course, that they, Peter in particular, don't argue about casting nets.
[831.86 → 834.86] They just simply do it this time, even after fishing all night.
[835.50 → 837.78] And then Jesus says, Hey, guys, come for breakfast.
[838.34 → 840.96] He's reinstating them into his mission.
[842.20 → 844.54] He's calling them into resurrected life.
[844.54 → 848.04] He already has a fire going and fish frying.
[849.24 → 850.98] You might wonder, well, where did he get those fish from?
[852.20 → 852.38] Right?
[852.90 → 854.02] Again, his sufficiency.
[854.78 → 856.86] And again, they are invited to eat with their Lord.
[858.64 → 863.90] And again, Scripture is always pointing out the significance of eating together, of a meal together.
[864.12 → 865.46] And it's about togetherness.
[865.66 → 867.00] And it's about community.
[867.84 → 872.46] A little aside here, but parents, continue to sit around a table and eat with your kids
[872.46 → 874.12] so you stay in each other's lives.
[874.12 → 874.92] Please keep that going.
[874.96 → 875.58] I think that's important.
[876.02 → 881.56] It was in settings like that, that much of Jesus' most intimate teachings were done.
[881.56 → 886.58] And where he displayed his humility for us to see him as a servant king.
[888.32 → 889.74] Because that's who he is.
[889.74 → 899.34] You know, somehow, times together over a meal or coffee or a beer or whatever it is,
[899.60 → 902.70] roots us in time and place and gives us a sense of belonging.
[902.94 → 906.00] And we say to each other, you matter.
[906.36 → 909.20] You matter enough to be in my life.
[909.20 → 912.88] And it's the power of hospitality at work.
[912.88 → 922.74] My wife knew I was working on this topic on this sermon about the breakfast on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.
[922.90 → 924.68] And she sent me this quote.
[924.78 → 927.02] And it's quite good what she found.
[927.02 → 930.52] Jesus was aware of what amount of words would stack up to him.
[930.54 → 932.56] And that's why he let his action do the talking.
[932.96 → 938.66] When he rose from the dead, Jesus didn't make a speech to the world or chastise his closest friends who scattered on him.
[938.70 → 940.56] Instead, he made breakfast for them.
[941.76 → 945.16] This action was a reminder from Jesus that his friends belonged.
[945.36 → 947.88] That they weren't disqualified because they had made mistakes.
[947.88 → 953.26] And that the dream of God's love was still alive for them and everyone else.
[954.60 → 961.08] Jesus, the resurrected king, sits down with his friends for a meal around a campfire.
[964.42 → 967.22] How many of you love to sit around a campfire with people?
[968.88 → 969.56] Yeah, right?
[969.72 → 971.94] You know, I think so many people do.
[972.14 → 975.68] You know, unless you've got crazy little kids running around the fire.
[975.68 → 979.72] And my wife's in a panic the whole time about who's going to catch fire.
[979.98 → 984.12] But, you know, it's a beautiful thing to sit around a campfire.
[984.28 → 985.72] And you just watch the fire.
[986.62 → 987.38] You talk.
[987.48 → 988.78] Sometimes there's some music, maybe.
[989.22 → 992.84] There's something about it that brings us together in a beautiful way.
[993.66 → 995.88] Jesus is sitting around a campfire with his friends.
[996.08 → 999.16] And he comes to their life where they are.
[999.16 → 1003.90] And he meets them there in ordinary, miraculous life.
[1005.68 → 1008.62] Ordinary, miraculous life.
[1011.62 → 1013.36] I think we miss that sometime.
[1013.94 → 1020.48] We want the miraculous to be, I don't know, the sea opening up.
[1021.70 → 1021.82] Right?
[1022.02 → 1023.30] That's nice too, I guess.
[1023.42 → 1027.54] But I think life itself is such a miracle.
[1027.74 → 1029.50] And I think Jesus wants us to see that.
[1029.50 → 1032.64] And again, in this passage, Jesus eats.
[1032.96 → 1037.22] He is demonstrating that he is physically alive.
[1039.66 → 1042.20] Making a campfire, frying up some fish.
[1043.08 → 1049.34] That's why we read in Acts, in the book of Acts, where we say,
[1049.34 → 1054.28] After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive.
[1054.36 → 1055.12] That's what's going on there.
[1055.80 → 1060.24] And he appeared to them over a period of 40 days and spoke about the kingdom of God.
[1061.24 → 1064.14] And we see that this is what's going on here.
[1064.24 → 1069.52] He's speaking of the kingdom of God in ways that enter their real lives.
[1069.52 → 1073.04] The resurrection is a crucial part of the story.
[1073.24 → 1075.08] It's what is accomplished through the cross.
[1075.18 → 1077.68] The forgiveness of sins, the reconciliation to the Father.
[1078.04 → 1082.04] It is a looking forward to the fullness of the kingdom and the renewal of all things.
[1082.26 → 1083.56] That is a lot.
[1085.20 → 1089.48] The great miracle of the gospel, that the gospel is proclaiming,
[1089.52 → 1093.26] is not merely that Christ lived bodily after the crucifixion.
[1093.46 → 1094.08] That's true.
[1094.08 → 1097.48] But that he lives dynamically in us today.
[1097.48 → 1101.80] He lives dynamically in us today.
[1101.98 → 1103.36] Do you believe that?
[1104.96 → 1106.30] Do you believe that?
[1109.52 → 1112.94] The resurrection, we don't isolate it.
[1113.12 → 1115.06] It needs to be in context.
[1115.46 → 1118.12] We need to consider Ascension Day when Jesus goes to heaven.
[1118.30 → 1120.84] We need to consider Pentecost when he sends the Holy Spirit.
[1121.10 → 1125.34] All of these things together is part of the whole story here.
[1125.34 → 1128.92] And we cannot grasp the meaning of the resurrection in isolation here.
[1129.30 → 1133.34] We are the people in whom the resurrected Jesus dwells.
[1134.72 → 1136.40] Let that sink in.
[1136.78 → 1140.08] We are the people in whom the resurrected Jesus dwells.
[1140.14 → 1141.84] Not figuratively.
[1141.84 → 1148.80] So Paul writes, and I love this passage, Ephesians 3.
[1148.90 → 1149.26] Paul writes,
[1149.26 → 1153.30] I pray that out of his glorious riches, there's this God of abundance again,
[1153.54 → 1158.70] that he may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being, inside, deep inside,
[1158.90 → 1161.30] so that Christ may dwell in your heart through faith.
[1161.64 → 1165.82] And I pray that you, being rooted and established in that love,
[1166.16 → 1170.54] may have power together with all of God's holy people to grasp,
[1170.90 → 1173.24] and I love the word grasp because you fight for it,
[1173.24 → 1177.16] to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,
[1177.40 → 1179.56] and to show this love that surpasses knowledge,
[1179.78 → 1182.72] that you may be filled to the measure of the fullness of God.
[1182.92 → 1184.76] And that phrase blows me away.
[1185.36 → 1189.24] Do you want to be filled with the fullness of God?
[1189.24 → 1193.64] What would 20% do?
[1195.76 → 1197.60] God wants to fill you.
[1200.52 → 1203.34] And this is why we don't simply stop at the resurrection.
[1204.52 → 1206.92] You know, Jesus conquered sin and death.
[1207.04 → 1208.30] Wonderful, and that is wonderful.
[1208.98 → 1212.56] But this is why chapter 21 is such an important part of the gospel story.
[1213.00 → 1216.06] Jesus comes where we are, and he calls us,
[1216.06 → 1220.30] and he empowers us to live on his mission in our lives right now.
[1221.54 → 1222.92] On the shores of a lake.
[1227.60 → 1232.80] I think of my friend Pete, who's not doing all that fabulously anymore.
[1233.82 → 1236.34] But the resurrection shows up now to Pete,
[1236.42 → 1239.56] not on the shores of a lake anymore, but in long-term care.
[1246.06 → 1248.48] Jesus comes where we are.
[1252.08 → 1257.66] And in a real sense, John's ending is just the beginning.
[1259.62 → 1261.80] We see that more clearly in the book of Acts.
[1262.84 → 1267.22] The gospel lives on in us because Christ dwells in us.
[1267.74 → 1270.72] Resurrection power is in you.
[1270.72 → 1276.32] And the great reformed theologian, John Calvin, said
[1276.32 → 1281.00] that union with Christ has the highest degree of importance.
[1281.42 → 1283.58] John Murray, a great Scottish theologian, agreed,
[1283.72 → 1286.32] calling it that doctrine of salvation,
[1286.66 → 1290.40] the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation.
[1290.84 → 1293.98] The whole point was union with Christ
[1293.98 → 1298.62] to accomplish his purposes for the world.
[1298.62 → 1303.48] And it completely reorients how we live and how we think.
[1303.80 → 1307.50] And our unity with Christ is at the very core of our identity.
[1307.92 → 1309.76] I think we have a lot of talk about identity nowadays.
[1310.14 → 1313.16] Our core identity is Christ in us.
[1318.30 → 1323.66] Romans 6, verse 4, Paul says,
[1324.24 → 1328.16] We were therefore buried with Christ through baptism into death.
[1328.16 → 1331.94] In order that just as Christ was raised from the dead
[1331.94 → 1333.12] through the glory of the Father,
[1333.66 → 1335.76] we too may have a new life.
[1336.06 → 1338.76] Christ didn't just die so he arose.
[1339.06 → 1341.56] He died so we would be like him
[1341.56 → 1343.90] and have his fullness.
[1347.08 → 1349.90] Resurrection is about abundant life for the world,
[1350.66 → 1354.12] for Peter, for the disciples, for you, for me.
[1354.12 → 1356.88] When all hope seems gone.
[1356.88 → 1359.16] When you wonder what you're doing.
[1359.38 → 1361.10] When you think there is no future.
[1361.44 → 1363.00] When your well is dried up
[1363.00 → 1366.16] and you doubt grace is true for the likes of you.
[1368.12 → 1370.46] And it is then that we hear Jesus' voice
[1370.46 → 1372.54] calling from the shore of where we find ourselves,
[1372.94 → 1376.10] inviting us once again to share a meal with him.
[1376.10 → 1382.16] As I said, we're going to have,
[1382.60 → 1383.90] not the last supper,
[1383.98 → 1385.40] but we're going to share in the last breakfast.
[1389.00 → 1391.42] We're going to have a fire, hopefully.
[1394.00 → 1394.66] There we go.
[1397.06 → 1398.86] We're on the shore of the Sea of Galilee.
[1398.86 → 1401.78] We're sitting around the fire.
[1403.28 → 1404.82] Warming up a bit.
[1404.90 → 1405.80] It's been kind of cool.
[1407.16 → 1408.50] We're just listening to the fire.
[1410.46 → 1413.46] We're thinking about what we've done with our lives
[1413.46 → 1414.58] and we have some regrets.
[1419.32 → 1420.58] Maybe you, like Peter,
[1420.66 → 1422.64] have been struggling throughout the night
[1422.64 → 1423.72] to deal with life
[1423.72 → 1425.88] and it's not working very well.
[1425.88 → 1429.50] And Jesus calls, and he says,
[1429.64 → 1430.70] fly the other side.
[1431.30 → 1432.18] Fly my side.
[1433.60 → 1434.68] You'll find some water.
[1436.36 → 1437.80] And maybe you wonder if you should.
[1437.90 → 1439.30] I mean, maybe, like Peter,
[1439.48 → 1442.06] you're struggling with who you are.
[1444.70 → 1447.48] Yeah, Jesus named you the rock, Peter,
[1447.48 → 1449.48] but you failed at being solid.
[1450.98 → 1452.82] And like a rock, you sunk.
[1454.84 → 1455.78] You sunk.
[1456.88 → 1460.14] Maybe Peter figured that he'd fish all night
[1460.14 → 1462.02] since he wasn't sleeping much anyway.
[1462.56 → 1465.14] He kept hearing the sound of roosters crowing
[1465.14 → 1466.84] and that kept making it feel like garbage.
[1467.48 → 1469.60] And he then reminded himself,
[1469.72 → 1471.98] you're not the rock, you are the denier.
[1472.24 → 1474.06] That's who you are.
[1474.06 → 1481.50] Two times in John's gospel,
[1482.32 → 1485.56] he specifically mentions charcoal fires.
[1486.32 → 1486.86] Just a couple.
[1487.86 → 1488.42] Charcoal.
[1488.42 → 1490.38] He's got very specific.
[1492.10 → 1492.88] Two places.
[1493.56 → 1495.68] The first time that he mentions charcoal fires
[1495.68 → 1496.80] is Good Friday.
[1498.18 → 1501.18] And Peter goes to where Jesus has been arrested
[1501.18 → 1504.02] and he's sitting around a fire warming himself up.
[1504.52 → 1506.12] And three times people come to him and say,
[1506.36 → 1507.72] well, you knew him.
[1507.94 → 1508.94] And he says, no, I didn't.
[1509.52 → 1510.34] Well, no, no, no.
[1510.34 → 1511.56] You are one of those guys,
[1511.68 → 1512.40] one of those disciples.
[1512.52 → 1513.24] You knew him.
[1513.24 → 1515.48] I don't know the man.
[1518.92 → 1520.16] You do know him.
[1530.24 → 1531.54] There's Jesus again.
[1533.24 → 1535.06] On the shore inviting him
[1535.06 → 1537.60] into real life again.
[1539.24 → 1541.52] Come around in a little charcoal fire.
[1541.52 → 1546.46] Inviting him into forever life
[1546.46 → 1548.98] and live on the pure goodness of grace.
[1549.56 → 1551.12] And he invites you and I
[1551.12 → 1553.92] to sit around his resurrection fire
[1553.92 → 1556.04] instead of that fire of shame,
[1556.34 → 1557.86] instead of that fire of doubt,
[1558.14 → 1559.16] that fire of betrayal,
[1559.32 → 1560.24] that fire of fear,
[1560.60 → 1562.00] that fire of self-sufficiency,
[1562.16 → 1563.38] that fire of self-loathing.
[1563.66 → 1565.48] Whatever fire you tend to sit around,
[1565.76 → 1567.84] he's inviting us to the resurrection fire.
[1571.52 → 1577.26] He offers abundant life,
[1578.26 → 1579.80] life in all its fullness.
[1581.16 → 1582.54] And all you need to do,
[1583.90 → 1585.52] you need to dive in
[1585.52 → 1589.38] and sit at that fire of grace.
[1589.38 → 1596.46] I want to invite you
[1596.46 → 1601.46] to go
[1601.46 → 1604.16] to one of the tables
[1604.16 → 1606.08] that are in the corners here.
[1606.80 → 1608.20] And I want you to first and foremost
[1608.20 → 1609.90] partake of Jesus.
[1612.06 → 1613.04] Partake of Jesus.
[1613.42 → 1614.18] Take the bread,
[1614.42 → 1615.14] take the juice,
[1615.64 → 1616.44] remind yourself
[1616.44 → 1617.52] this is Christ's body,
[1617.62 → 1618.66] this is Christ's blood.
[1619.06 → 1621.14] And you take Jesus in.
[1621.90 → 1623.14] It's visceral.
[1623.54 → 1624.90] You take Jesus in
[1624.90 → 1626.90] and he dwells in you.
[1630.18 → 1631.60] He dwells in you.
[1632.64 → 1634.18] He becomes a part of you
[1634.18 → 1637.36] and he is your true identity.
[1637.36 → 1641.90] And then I want you to
[1641.90 → 1644.14] take that bread
[1644.14 → 1645.42] and that juice
[1645.42 → 1646.30] back to your seat.
[1647.10 → 1648.12] And I want you to reflect
[1648.12 → 1649.06] for a while
[1649.06 → 1650.52] because you'll hear the song
[1650.52 → 1651.22] of the man's name.
[1651.36 → 1654.46] And I want you to reflect
[1654.46 → 1656.90] what does it mean to you
[1656.90 → 1659.74] that Jesus allows you to do?
[1661.14 → 1662.76] How would this change
[1662.76 → 1663.68] when you live
[1663.68 → 1665.24] to know that Jesus
[1665.24 → 1671.38] to know that his blood
[1671.38 → 1672.60] was shed
[1672.60 → 1674.08] beneath you?
[1676.46 → 1677.54] What does that mean?
[1678.96 → 1680.42] And then when you sit down,
[1681.38 → 1682.70] I want you to take,
[1683.34 → 1683.96] eat,
[1684.44 → 1685.06] and drink
[1685.06 → 1686.34] and remember
[1686.34 → 1687.20] and believe
[1687.20 → 1688.36] that Jesus
[1688.36 → 1689.60] is the love of you.
[1689.60 → 1694.96] and then on top of that,
[1695.50 → 1697.66] you're going to see
[1697.66 → 1699.96] little fish crackers
[1699.96 → 1702.18] at the table.
[1703.66 → 1704.36] You hear the things
[1704.36 → 1705.12] that you're just hearing.
[1705.12 → 1710.46] But it's,
[1710.70 → 1711.28] sometimes
[1711.28 → 1713.26] in the history
[1713.26 → 1713.90] of Christianity,
[1714.08 → 1714.64] sometimes fish
[1714.64 → 1715.46] are a part of the community.
[1716.78 → 1717.70] Especially in communities
[1717.70 → 1718.66] where there were a lot of fish
[1718.66 → 1719.40] and in this story
[1719.40 → 1720.76] there were fish as well.
[1721.18 → 1721.70] And this time,
[1721.84 → 1723.00] take one of the fish
[1723.00 → 1723.82] and a lot of,
[1723.90 → 1724.42] the first service,
[1724.54 → 1725.36] I think a lot of people said,
[1725.72 → 1727.14] I don't like those little fish.
[1727.44 → 1727.72] Just,
[1727.90 → 1730.24] just take the little fish
[1730.24 → 1730.82] as a symbol.
[1730.94 → 1732.22] You don't even have to eat it.
[1732.42 → 1733.14] Just look at it.
[1733.14 → 1736.28] But it is a reminder
[1736.28 → 1738.64] that Jesus said,
[1739.08 → 1740.66] I will make you fish your love.
[1741.92 → 1743.28] I will bring you in
[1743.28 → 1744.04] on the mission
[1744.04 → 1746.32] that I just started.
[1747.42 → 1748.48] It's why I breathe
[1748.48 → 1749.84] my spirit into you
[1749.84 → 1751.02] so that you
[1751.02 → 1752.12] could live out the life
[1752.12 → 1753.20] that I want you to live.
[1753.70 → 1754.70] And he wants you then
[1754.70 → 1756.52] to bring that mission,
[1756.70 → 1757.28] that love,
[1757.42 → 1758.10] that grace
[1758.10 → 1759.26] into your family,
[1759.68 → 1760.66] into your marriages,
[1760.88 → 1761.80] into your friendships,
[1762.16 → 1762.92] into the community
[1762.92 → 1763.44] around you
[1763.44 → 1765.36] however he leads you.
[1771.00 → 1772.36] I invite you to come
[1772.36 → 1773.22] to the table.
[1773.60 → 1774.30] And as Jesus said
[1774.30 → 1775.16] at the last breakfast,
[1775.90 → 1776.46] come to the table.
[1776.46 → 1785.44] the elders,
[1785.44 → 1787.24] the deacons who are here
[1787.24 → 1787.82] could come from
[1787.82 → 1788.60] one of the tables,
[1788.68 → 1789.28] that would be great.
[1789.28 → 1790.46] Thank you.
[1798.54 → 1802.42] Thank you.
[1802.42 → 1802.64] Thank you.
[1802.64 → 1832.62] Thank you.
[1832.64 → 1862.62] Thank you.
[1862.64 → 1892.62] Thank you.
[1892.64 → 1922.62] Thank you.
[1922.64 → 1952.62] Thank you.
[1952.64 → 1982.62] Thank you.
[1982.64 → 2012.62] Thank you.
[2012.64 → 2042.62] Thank you.
[2042.64 → 2072.62] Thank you.
[2072.62 → 2075.64] A bit of a poem slash prayer that Ted Lower wrote.
[2075.86 → 2076.92] I'm going to share with you now.
[2076.92 → 2084.16] Oh God, it's hard for me to let go most times.
[2084.16 → 2089.16] And the squeeze I exert.
[2089.16 → 2094.16] Loosen my grip on my fears.
[2094.16 → 2124.16] 
[2124.16 → 2129.16] See kingdoms, I feel like I'm going to see kingdoms, find power, and reach out.
[2129.16 → 2135.16] It is to know myself.
[2135.20 → 2138.54] Sound drum, IN of the word, end of my fingers,
[2138.54 → 2140.26] into the deepest of silence
[2140.26 → 2142.34] and my own unchartered longings.
[2142.40 → 2143.96] I find myself held by you
[2143.96 → 2146.02] and linked in you to all life
[2146.02 → 2148.42] in this wild and wondrous world
[2148.42 → 2149.76] you love so much.
[2150.36 → 2151.74] And so I take to heart
[2151.74 → 2154.68] that you have taken me to heart.
[2157.08 → 2161.08] Know that he dwells in you right now.
