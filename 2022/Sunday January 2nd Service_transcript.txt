[0.00 --> 5.68]  Well, it is a gift for us to gather around God's Word this morning, and we're going to focus this
[5.68 --> 10.70]  morning on what I would describe as a historic Christian practice that feels unusually fitting
[10.70 --> 17.98]  for us to focus on as we go into 2022, and that is waiting. So, if you have your Bible,
[18.14 --> 21.40]  either digitally or physically, I invite you to turn with me both to Luke 2,
[21.40 --> 23.88]  and then I'm going to read also from 2 Peter 3.
[30.00 --> 39.44]  Now, there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for
[39.44 --> 44.68]  the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. It had been revealed to him by the
[44.68 --> 50.82]  Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah. Moved by the Spirit,
[50.82 --> 55.20]  he went into the temple courts, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him
[55.20 --> 61.06]  what the custom of the law required, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,
[61.92 --> 68.40]  Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have
[68.40 --> 75.40]  seen your salvation, which you have prepared in sight of all nations, a light for revelation to
[75.40 --> 84.50]  the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel. And now over to 2 Peter 3, starting in verse 8.
[85.20 --> 95.90]  But do not forget this one thing, dear friends. With the Lord, a day is like a thousand years,
[96.80 --> 102.80]  and a thousand years are like a day. The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise as some understand
[102.80 --> 110.44]  slowness. Instead, He's patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to
[110.44 --> 122.20]  repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. Well, I've mentioned before that one of my
[122.20 --> 126.88]  favorite movies of all time is The Matrix. And no, I have not seen... I've mentioned before that one of
[126.88 --> 131.92]  my favorite movies of all time is The Matrix. And no, I have not seen the new ones, and do not tell me
[131.92 --> 137.82]  anything about it. If you've seen The Matrix, you'll know that one of the main characters is a fellow
[137.82 --> 146.48]  named Morpheus. And Morpheus is a person of purpose. In fact, he has organized his entire life around an
[146.48 --> 153.12]  oracle, a promise, that he would be the one who finds the one. And in the bigger picture, there's a
[153.12 --> 157.56]  war between machines and humans, and people are living in this matrix, which is sort of not the real
[157.56 --> 163.16]  world. And Morpheus has waken up. He knows his purpose, that he is to search for and find and
[163.16 --> 170.32]  wait for the one. Of course, that time comes when he finds Neo, who is the one. And he explains to Neo
[170.32 --> 177.92]  that generations of people have been waiting for him, that generations of people have been longing to
[177.92 --> 184.04]  find and hold and behold the one who would save them from this war against the machines.
[184.04 --> 194.34]  Morpheus, in my mind, is a picture of the Christian of purpose, the Christian who is waiting, actively
[194.34 --> 201.60]  hoping to find the one. One of the things that struck me this Advent season, in two of the services
[201.60 --> 207.36]  I was watching online, but one of the things that struck me about this Advent season is that Jesus comes
[207.36 --> 215.28]  into a context where people are longing to find him. He enters into a culture, the Israel culture,
[215.28 --> 222.48]  where people are waiting for him. They've been praying for his arrival for years, for decades,
[222.48 --> 228.32]  for generations. And when he is found by people, they celebrate because he is the one they've been
[228.32 --> 234.48]  waiting for. They found the one. One commentator in Luke 2 points out that all the characters,
[234.48 --> 242.96]  all the characters, Mary, Zachariah, Simeon, Anna, Elizabeth, they're all waiting. They're all waiting
[242.96 --> 249.06]  for the Messiah that was promised to show up. And Simeon, who we just read about, is one of those
[249.06 --> 253.38]  characters who's waiting. In fact, there's that little phrase about him that I find so striking.
[253.94 --> 258.34]  It says about Simeon, we don't know a lot about him. We know he loves the Lord. We know he serves the
[258.34 --> 265.68]  Lord, and we know that the Spirit told him that he would see the Messiah before he died. Imagine how
[265.68 --> 270.58]  it would have shaped his life as he got older especially. He knows from the revelation of the
[270.58 --> 275.16]  Spirit that he will meet the Messiah. But there's that phrase about Simeon that says he was waiting
[275.16 --> 280.50]  for the consolation of Israel. And that little statement basically brings up the entire Old
[280.50 --> 287.06]  Testament story that we preach through over Advent, that God promised to deal with sin, that God promised
[287.06 --> 291.26]  to restore Israel, that God promised to bring forgiveness and renewal and give his people new
[291.26 --> 297.36]  hearts and bring redemption to his whole creation. And Simeon was one of the many people, part of the
[297.36 --> 305.78]  people of Israel, who were desperately waiting to find that Messiah. Day in and day out, they would have been
[305.78 --> 313.86]  praying, going to the temple, asking for the Lord to come in power and glory. And I don't know if this is
[313.86 --> 320.50]  as remarkable to you as it is to me. But you need to know that the events described in Luke 2 come
[320.50 --> 326.66]  after 400 years of what people call the 400 years of silence, the time between Malachi and Matthew or
[326.66 --> 334.12]  Malachi and the gospel of Luke. 400 years pass. 400 years where there are no prophecies, there's no kings
[334.12 --> 338.50]  who come, there's no messages from the Lord about what's happening. It's called the season of silence.
[338.50 --> 348.42]  And yet, after 400 years of silence from God, when Jesus comes, people are waiting.
[350.02 --> 355.64]  And of course, the good news of Luke 2 for Simeon is that God did not disappoint. The day came where
[355.64 --> 360.68]  Simeon was moved to go into the temple and he sees Mary, he sees Joseph, he sees that child, and he knows,
[360.92 --> 367.38]  he knows that that is the Messiah. And so he goes up to the child, he holds the child, and he says,
[367.38 --> 374.50]  Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace. For my eyes have
[374.50 --> 380.74]  seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations. You know what Simeon's
[380.74 --> 388.60]  basically saying there? I can die, Lord. I can die. I've seen with my own eyes the salvation
[388.60 --> 394.84]  through this child that is Jesus Christ. That's a powerful scene.
[397.48 --> 403.12]  But now as we move beyond the Advent season, as we move beyond the Christmas season into a new year,
[403.12 --> 407.24]  I want to highlight something that I think sometimes we just don't highlight enough in the church.
[407.56 --> 413.16]  And this is one of the most intriguing and confusing and beautiful parts of the biblical story.
[413.16 --> 420.24]  And that is that things did not come to an end when Jesus came. Or to put it differently,
[420.48 --> 426.52]  we don't just look back on what happened when Jesus came. We're also still waiting.
[427.64 --> 433.66]  And to join the church is to join a community that is still waiting. In fact, one of the things that
[433.66 --> 438.02]  would have confused the early disciples, and we know even Paul, he was just trying to struggle with
[438.02 --> 442.10]  what in the world it meant that Jesus rose from the dead and he went to be with the Father, but
[442.66 --> 448.10]  Caesar was still on the throne. Herod's were still in power. Corruption and violence and pain and death
[448.10 --> 454.18]  and sin were still experienced. What did Jesus come to do? They thought that that would be the end of
[454.18 --> 459.94]  the story. They thought that Jesus would decisively once and for all deal with sin, deal with violence,
[459.94 --> 465.30]  deal with hatred, renew his creation, bring the fullness of his blessing. And then they see this Messiah
[465.30 --> 471.54]  figure Jesus get handed over and crucified, the most humiliating death. They see him rise from the
[471.54 --> 476.34]  dead, which confirms that he is the anointed one, that he is the Messiah. But then he ascends to be
[476.34 --> 482.74]  with the Father. And there's still pain. And don't get me wrong, I want to underscore that Jesus
[483.06 --> 489.86]  decisively gained victory over death. He decisively defeated Satan. He decisively took on and absorbed
[489.86 --> 497.14]  and took our sin for us in and through his death and resurrection. But even after that, we still
[497.14 --> 506.98]  grieve death. We still experience temptation. We still experience all the pain that this world has
[506.98 --> 512.90]  in suffering under the curse of sin. And the striking thing, and I'm going to come back to this in just a
[512.90 --> 518.26]  minute, is that Jesus isn't just sort of like forgetting the plan. It's not like he doesn't know what
[518.26 --> 522.82]  people were hoping for. What Jesus has done, and this is what the parables in Matthew are all about,
[522.82 --> 529.14]  is he sort of pushed back the end of all things, the judgment over evil and sin and misery and all
[529.14 --> 536.10]  the rest. He pushed that back so that more people could come to faith in him, turn their lives in
[536.10 --> 541.78]  repentance and faith, and experience his kingdom that has come but is still coming in its fullness at
[541.78 --> 553.30]  a later point. And so, if that's true, you and I as Christians enter into a story where we are still
[553.30 --> 560.26]  waiting for the conclusion. To join a church, to be a believer, is to join a community that is patiently
[560.26 --> 566.26]  waiting in hope for the day when Jesus who came and conquered will come again in glory and power
[566.26 --> 572.02]  and blessing. He will once and for all judge evil. He will deal with sin. He will make this whole
[572.02 --> 575.46]  creation new once and for all. We still wait for that.
[580.58 --> 584.66]  Simone Weil, a Jewish writer, actually puts it this way. I think he's… I wouldn't state it the
[584.66 --> 589.86]  same way, but he gets his point across. He writes, waiting patiently in expectation
[590.58 --> 597.54]  is the foundation of the spiritual life. What do you think of that quote? Waiting patiently
[597.54 --> 602.98]  in expectation is the foundation of the spiritual life. And what he's after, and this is so foundational
[602.98 --> 608.50]  in Christianity, is that we actually live in hope. We've been told that Jesus who came is coming again.
[608.50 --> 615.22]  The last words of Jesus in Revelation is, I am coming soon. And John, who's writing this Revelation,
[615.22 --> 621.86]  says, yes, come soon, Jesus. And so we have hope for that future. And what defines our life, kind of
[621.86 --> 630.74]  like Morpheus in the Oracle, is waiting patiently and living our lives accordingly to what is still coming.
[632.82 --> 638.58]  And now I want us to do some reflection on how that's going for us as the church of Jesus.
[638.58 --> 646.18]  Because here's my hunch. I could be wrong. Maybe it's not true for you. I think most Western believers
[646.74 --> 653.94]  are terrible at waiting. I know that's true for me. I'm not good at waiting. And I think for you and I,
[653.94 --> 659.14]  growing up in the digital modern age, waiting is a very hard thing for us. I mean, you and I can turn
[659.14 --> 664.58]  on our TV. We have instant streaming. Younger people don't even know what Blockbuster was. You have to,
[664.58 --> 668.82]  like, go out of your house and go, yeah, I see one person nodding. You have to, like, go find a movie.
[668.82 --> 673.70]  And it took you, like, an hour to decide as a family. We can now sit on our couch with our phone,
[673.70 --> 679.38]  punch in some numbers, and food shows up at our door hot 15 minutes later. You didn't even move.
[680.90 --> 686.98]  We live in the day of same-day delivery with Amazon. And we can get frustrated or stressed or angry if it
[686.98 --> 692.98]  shows up the next day. Or we get kindled because we don't have the patience to wait for the book.
[692.98 --> 699.22]  I mean, this is the world we live in. And I mean, it's not just me who comments on how this is forming
[699.22 --> 704.50]  us into an instant gratification, impatient culture. There's many jokes from many people.
[704.50 --> 709.46]  Just last week, I don't know if any of you were on the Clayton Facebook page. It's a very pleasant
[709.46 --> 714.74]  page. No one's arguing over COVID on that page. It's very peaceful. That's a joke, by the way.
[716.18 --> 720.90]  And someone posted on that page, I don't know who needs to hear this. This is the quote. I don't know who needs to
[720.90 --> 726.10]  hear this, but stop trying to track that Facebook or that Amazon package. It's in God's hands now.
[727.46 --> 732.10]  And that joke, it's funny, and you know why. Because we've all done it. I haven't done this.
[732.34 --> 736.10]  Other people have done this where you're like, reload, reload. Where is it shipped? When's it coming?
[736.10 --> 744.42]  When's the estimated arrival time? Because we're so impatient. We're so hardwired for instant gratification.
[744.42 --> 752.34]  And that is a problem when it comes to living in a story where we are called to wait for its
[752.34 --> 758.74]  conclusion. We are called to learn the practices of kindling hope and organizing our lives around
[758.74 --> 762.98]  that thing that is still coming, that is the return of Jesus Christ, to renew all things.
[764.26 --> 766.82]  But now, here's where I'm going to get into our business a little more. I actually think there's
[766.82 --> 773.14]  a deeper, harder, and more difficult question for us to ask. You ready for it? Are we even waiting at all?
[774.90 --> 782.34]  Are we even waiting at all for Jesus' return? Can you and I really relate, if we're honest with
[782.34 --> 790.18]  ourselves, to Simeon or Zechariah or Elizabeth or Mary or Anna, all the characters in Luke 2? Can we relate
[790.18 --> 800.02]  to sort of a life that is marked by hopeful, patient, prayerful waiting? Well, we are regularly praying,
[800.02 --> 807.46]  Lord, may it be in my lifetime that I see your Messiah come in glory and power. Is that our prayer?
[809.06 --> 816.98]  I don't know. I know that for me, it is easy to get not just formed by the instant gratification,
[816.98 --> 821.46]  impatience of our culture. I'm getting pulled right out of the biblical story into a whole different
[821.46 --> 828.26]  story that isn't waiting, right? There's many books that have been written on the Western narrative,
[828.26 --> 833.30]  on sort of the secular story. And one of the things that many writers, believers and non-believers,
[833.30 --> 838.98]  agree on is that most people are not optimistic and hopeful about the future. And therefore, what we
[838.98 --> 846.10]  do is we live just in the present moment. We live in what one writer calls the imminent frame. Don't
[846.10 --> 852.10]  think about the past. Don't think about the future. Just enjoy the moment. One writer describes our
[852.10 --> 859.54]  cultural way of living as a cheerful nihilism. A cheerful nihilism. That is to say, we are very
[859.54 --> 863.62]  actually fearful about the future. What will happen to our world? What will, you know, what will come in
[863.62 --> 868.02]  the future of all the decisions we make in our creation? Sort of a fear about the future. And as a
[868.02 --> 872.26]  result, we don't talk about it. We also don't like the past. And so, we just sort of enjoy the moment.
[872.26 --> 876.50]  We enjoy what we can buy. We enjoy where we can travel. What we look forward to is the next Amazon
[876.50 --> 882.90]  package, the next event at Rogers Arena, the next game we can buy, the next technological
[882.90 --> 887.06]  gadget that'll make our lives just a little bit easier and faster and simpler. That's what we live
[887.06 --> 894.18]  just in the imminent frame. And so, I have to ask the question, are we even living in our story?
[894.18 --> 904.10]  Are we even a people who are waiting? When's the last time we've prayed for Jesus to come back in
[904.10 --> 911.46]  our lifetime? That was a staple prayer for Jewish people before the arrival of Christ the first time.
[912.10 --> 921.22]  That was the deepest longing of hearts that they would, like Simeon, hold the Messiah. Is that our story?
[921.22 --> 928.74]  And now I want to read for us what I think is a very, very powerful passage from 2 Peter 3. I
[928.74 --> 933.46]  actually read this in my own devotions a week ago, and I just marveled at this passage. There's many
[933.46 --> 937.86]  sermons I could preach on this, but here's our New Year's message right here. 2 Peter 3,
[937.86 --> 945.06]  but do not forget this one thing, dear friends. With the Lord, a day is like a thousand years,
[945.06 --> 952.18]  and a thousand years are like a day. The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, as some understand
[952.18 --> 957.94]  slowness. Instead, He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come
[957.94 --> 965.86]  to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. Are you catching that passage? I mean,
[965.86 --> 971.06]  it has so much to tell us about God's character, God's timing, God's patience. And this is, by the way,
[971.06 --> 977.14]  Peter writes this to a persecuted church where Christians, at least if not at the time of writing,
[977.14 --> 982.82]  shortly thereafter, are being killed for saying that Jesus is Lord and not the Caesar. So this is
[982.82 --> 987.78]  serious business. Like, they're not playing church. They could be killed for being believers. And Peter
[987.78 --> 998.34]  is saying to them, Church, don't lose hope. Don't give way to fear. Don't give way to despair. The same
[998.34 --> 1003.86]  God who called you into faith, the same God who brought you into redemption through Jesus, He's
[1003.86 --> 1011.94]  coming. Jesus is coming. Hold on to hope. Hold on to your trust. Hold on to faith as you wait for the
[1011.94 --> 1018.58]  day where Jesus will be revealed in glory and power. All the enemies of Jesus will be brought down,
[1018.58 --> 1023.62]  and their whole restoration of this creation will take place. Hold on to hope, church.
[1023.62 --> 1033.14]  And I can't help but think that's a word in season for the Western church, who perhaps in this season,
[1033.14 --> 1038.34]  at this time, is living in a whole lot of fear. Perhaps fear about the future, fear about the
[1038.34 --> 1043.38]  present, and at the same time is being lulled out of the true story, the biblical story, into a story
[1043.38 --> 1049.70]  that has our gaze fixed on the imminent frame, the here and the now, and we just avoid any sense of what
[1049.70 --> 1055.62]  is to come. And Peter says to us, along with the New Testament writers and the Old Testament writers,
[1056.18 --> 1064.34]  wait for the Lord. As Psalm 27 puts it, wait for the Lord. Be strong. Do not give up hope. Wait for the Lord.
[1068.18 --> 1072.66]  I wonder if one of the things that we should commit ourselves to going into 2022
[1072.66 --> 1078.50]  is learning how to wait. How does that sound for resolution? I don't think that's going to make it
[1078.50 --> 1085.78]  on any like Facebook pages or popular social media posts. Learning how to wait. The resolution of 2022.
[1087.46 --> 1094.18]  Joining the generations of people who have gone before us, praying that Christ would come in our
[1094.18 --> 1098.90]  lifetime. I don't know about you, I have grandparents who prayed for that. I also have parents who pray for
[1098.90 --> 1103.70]  that. My mom regularly tells me, and I actually used to think this is interesting or quaint, and now I actually
[1103.70 --> 1109.06]  think it's beautiful. A regular prayer that Jesus will come in her lifetime. Is that your prayer?
[1109.86 --> 1114.74]  Because praying like that is praying like Simeon, praying like Anna, praying like Mary, praying like Elizabeth,
[1114.74 --> 1120.02]  praying like Zachariah, praying like the generations of believers who have gone before us and asked for the
[1120.02 --> 1128.18]  kingdom to come in its fullness in our lifetime. The renewal that God promises in Jesus to come finally and once and for all.
[1128.18 --> 1134.34]  One of the prayers that's been bubbling up in me over this week as I've been living in these passages
[1135.30 --> 1141.38]  has been that Jesus would come in our lifetime, and that this church and the churches in our city would
[1141.38 --> 1148.82]  be churches that are ready. Churches that have hearts like Simeon that are so full of joy that the
[1148.82 --> 1156.42]  Savior who came in obscurity, now coming in glory, is here. And we are ready for the liberation that He has come
[1156.42 --> 1161.38]  and promised and will without question bring. The resurrection seals it.
[1164.66 --> 1168.66]  But I want to spend just a few minutes talking about how this kind of patience, this kind of waiting,
[1168.66 --> 1175.14]  this kind of hope doesn't come naturally. I don't think it comes naturally to anyone living in the
[1175.14 --> 1183.38]  impatient, instant gratification, Western story. And what's striking to me is in Luke 2, if you read the
[1183.38 --> 1188.26]  whole passage from beginning to end just that chapter, you'll notice that a lot of the activity
[1188.26 --> 1194.66]  happens around the temple. A lot of the activity happens in places of prayer and worship. And what
[1194.66 --> 1199.30]  I know, at least from reading about the Israelites in the Old Testament, they had feasts and celebrations
[1199.30 --> 1207.46]  and gatherings all the time where they grounded themselves again in the Scriptures. They grounded
[1207.46 --> 1214.82]  themselves together in the promises that God made to renew all things, and they stirred together the
[1214.82 --> 1220.90]  hope of the true story. And just to give you sort of a glimpse of how I experienced that myself over the
[1220.90 --> 1225.94]  course of December, like three weeks ago now, which feels like forever ago after you spend time in
[1225.94 --> 1229.70]  isolation. But about three weeks ago, it was mid-December, and the Grunheim, I don't know if
[1229.70 --> 1235.14]  you have this in December, the Grunheim was a bit of a crazy mess. And Brittany got sick, and I noticed
[1235.14 --> 1239.14]  that when I get sick, everything is just fine in my family. But when Brittany gets sick, the whole house
[1239.14 --> 1243.94]  collapses into chaos and disorder. And so Brittany got sick, I was juggling a number of things at home,
[1243.94 --> 1250.18]  and with our kids, and also with work. And it was Thursday night, and it was Dwell. And I felt,
[1250.18 --> 1254.98]  if I'm honest with you, like skipping Dwell. But the problem is, I'm the lead pastor, and I have to go,
[1254.98 --> 1259.62]  because it looks bad if you're not there. We're being honest this morning, right? So I go to Dwell.
[1259.62 --> 1264.02]  I'm going there tired. I'm going there exhausted. I join the worship and the prayer. I'm late.
[1264.66 --> 1271.22]  And you know what happens? We start praying together. We start singing. And Jonathan and Brittany,
[1271.22 --> 1276.58]  they organize the whole thing around waiting and hope. And I found as I'm praying with them,
[1276.58 --> 1281.22]  I'm getting drawn into the worship, I'm singing. All of a sudden, my heart is getting realigned
[1281.22 --> 1286.90]  with the true story. I went in there in a deep, bad place, and I came out of there in a different
[1286.90 --> 1291.38]  space. Have you ever experienced that in worship? You ever experienced that praying with friends in
[1291.38 --> 1296.50]  your small group? You ever experienced that just gathering together with other believers to be in
[1296.50 --> 1303.06]  the presence of Christ in prayer? That's what happens. You get drawn back into the true story. You get pulled
[1303.06 --> 1312.90]  back into hope. You learn how to wait together. And one of my honest concerns about this whole season
[1312.90 --> 1319.46]  of COVID is that it often forces us away from each other, which is the one thing we often need to
[1319.46 --> 1327.06]  kindle and gather ourselves in patient hope. And I want to say as a pastor to the church this morning,
[1327.06 --> 1335.14]  do not let your life fall into isolation because we need each other to kindle worship, to kindle prayer,
[1335.14 --> 1342.50]  to live in patient expectation that Jesus, our Lord and Savior, is coming, and He's coming in glory
[1342.50 --> 1348.10]  and power, and everything God promised will come to pass when He returns.
[1348.10 --> 1358.42]  Finally, let me say this about patience and waiting. It is not passive. I think the word
[1358.42 --> 1362.66]  waiting for most of us, when you hear it, it kind of feels like sitting around doing nothing.
[1363.30 --> 1367.46]  But one of the reasons I love the example of Morpheus is because when you watch the movie The
[1367.46 --> 1373.62]  Matrix, he is not passive. In fact, he's spending all of his time freeing people's minds. That's the
[1373.62 --> 1379.22]  way they describe it in The Matrix, where he's waking people up to see reality, that The Matrix
[1379.22 --> 1384.18]  is actually an illusion, but what's behind the scenes that no one sees is this cosmic battle.
[1384.18 --> 1388.66]  And Morpheus wants people to see this is what's really happening. You need to live in a certain
[1388.66 --> 1394.66]  way because this is the true story. And he invites people to join him in waiting and searching for
[1394.66 --> 1401.62]  the One. That for me is a picture of the church waiting. We don't sit on our hands. We face reality for
[1401.62 --> 1410.10]  what it is. And we boldly, courageously, lovingly invite people to turn their gaze to see Jesus
[1410.10 --> 1416.58]  Christ for who He is. We invite people to see that the King who came and was humiliated on the cross
[1416.58 --> 1424.66]  is coming again in glory and power and restoration. And He will bring down every stronghold that stands
[1424.66 --> 1430.18]  against the kingdom of God, and He will bring restoration to His entire creation forever.
[1431.62 --> 1438.98]  The work we do in the time between resurrection and return is make Jesus known. And you've heard me
[1438.98 --> 1445.94]  say this a dozen times from behind this pulpit. The reason Jesus hasn't come back yet is because God is
[1445.94 --> 1451.38]  patient. That's what 2 Peter 3 says. The reason God has not sent Jesus to bring restoration is because
[1451.38 --> 1457.46]  He wants more people to hear the gospel of Jesus and turn in repentance and faith. Think about that.
[1458.18 --> 1461.70]  That's the reason He hasn't come back. He's not lazy. He's not asleep behind the wheel. He hasn't
[1461.70 --> 1467.70]  forgotten the promise He's made. He is patiently, graciously pushing back the end of the story
[1467.70 --> 1472.34]  so that people can respond and live in the salvation of Jesus.
[1472.34 --> 1480.90]  That means we have work to do. If 2022 will be for us a season of learning how to wait, it is an active
[1481.46 --> 1487.54]  waiting where we courageously share the faith we have in the Savior that is Jesus.
[1490.82 --> 1495.22]  Let me finish with an image that comes from Leslie Newbegin about the church waiting for Jesus' return.
[1495.22 --> 1499.46]  Newbegin has this beautiful picture. Newbegin is a missionary in India who came back to the West and
[1499.46 --> 1504.82]  helped a lot of people see how to live into the biblical story. But his image was of Jesus Christ
[1504.82 --> 1510.42]  as the bright morning star that's rising over the world. And just picture this beautiful sunrise. I
[1510.42 --> 1515.30]  know it's hard for us in BC to picture that, but we had some recently, a beautiful huge sunrise just
[1515.30 --> 1525.94]  dipping up in the horizon. And he pictures Christians as people who turn and see that shining bright light.
[1525.94 --> 1534.18]  Their faces are locked on that sun that is rising. And we start moving towards that light. Our gaze fixed
[1534.18 --> 1539.38]  on it, our hope fixed on it, knowing that that sun is going to rise. And when Newbegin says,
[1539.94 --> 1545.62]  the churches must do as we see the light and the light reflects off our face, there are still many
[1545.62 --> 1553.86]  people in darkness. But what they now see is the light radiating off of the faces of believers.
[1554.42 --> 1558.58]  And as those living in darkness see the light radiating off the faces of believers, it causes
[1558.58 --> 1568.34]  them to turn and see that rising sun that is Jesus the King who will bring that final day and the whole
[1568.34 --> 1578.66]  creation will radiate with His light. That's our mission and that is our hope. So to quote Psalm 27, church,
[1579.70 --> 1588.90]  wait for the Lord. Be strong. Do not give up hope. Wait for the Lord. Let's pray.
[1588.90 --> 1600.58]  Father, you are our rock. You have been faithful through the generations.
[1602.18 --> 1610.82]  Seasons come and seasons go, and you are always here. Father, we praise you for making good on all of your
[1610.82 --> 1617.54]  promises. The way in Jesus' coming shows that you do not forget, you are not asleep,
[1618.10 --> 1622.18]  you are actively making all things new. And we thank you that the work is finished,
[1622.82 --> 1629.06]  that Jesus has defeated Satan, He has defeated sin, and He has defeated death. And we do not wait in
[1629.06 --> 1635.62]  vain. We wait with the Holy Spirit. We wait with the deposit that is guaranteeing our inheritance.
[1636.26 --> 1645.78]  So Lord, give us hope. Give us patience. Allow us to see what it means to live in light of your return.
[1645.78 --> 1650.42]  And Lord, I pray on behalf of our whole church and the church around the world,
[1651.06 --> 1654.82]  come soon and heal your world. Amen.
[1654.82 --> 1654.90]  Amen.
[1664.66 --> 1667.14]  At this point in the service, we're welcoming our children back
[1667.14 --> 1673.46]  to participate with us in the Lord's Supper. And I'll just give a moment for our children to return.
[1673.46 --> 1673.58]  Amen.
[1673.58 --> 1673.66]  Amen.
[1673.66 --> 1673.70]  Amen.
[1673.70 --> 1673.74]  Amen.
[1673.74 --> 1673.78]  Amen.
[1673.78 --> 1673.82]  Amen.
[1673.82 --> 1673.86]  Amen.
[1673.86 --> 1673.90]  Amen.
[1673.90 --> 1673.94]  Amen.
[1673.94 --> 1673.98]  Amen.
[1673.98 --> 1674.38]  Amen.
[1674.38 --> 1674.90]  Amen.
[1674.90 --> 1674.94]  Amen.
[1674.94 --> 1675.94]  Amen.
[1675.94 --> 1676.94]  Amen.
[1676.94 --> 1677.94]  Amen.
[1677.94 --> 1678.94]  Amen.
[1678.94 --> 1679.94]  Amen.
[1679.94 --> 1680.94]  Amen.
[1680.94 --> 1681.94]  Amen.
[1681.94 --> 1682.94]  Amen.
[1682.94 --> 1683.94]  Amen.
[1683.94 --> 1684.80]  Amen.
[1684.82 --> 1694.24]  Amen.
[1694.24 --> 1698.84]  This is a meal that brothers and sisters of ours around the world and throughout history
[1698.84 --> 1700.32]  have practiced.
[1700.32 --> 1708.44]  And it's a meal where we look back and where we look forward, where we remember and believe
[1708.44 --> 1714.80]  what Jesus has done, and it kindles us with hope for what Jesus is still going to do.
[1714.80 --> 1717.30]  It's a meal of grace that teaches us to wait.
[1717.30 --> 1722.22]  And I realize that I should wait for more of our children to come into our building.
[1722.22 --> 1723.22]  Amen.
[1723.22 --> 1724.22]  Amen.
[1724.22 --> 1727.22]  That's my impatience right there.
[1727.22 --> 1728.22]  Amen.
[1728.22 --> 1731.60]  Amen.
[1731.60 --> 1732.72]  Amen.
[1736.64 --> 1736.72]  Okay.
[1736.72 --> 1737.44]  Thank you.
[1737.56 --> 1739.56]  Sunday Cornerstone helpers.
[1739.56 --> 1748.94]  And if this is a meal of remembrance and a meal of hope, my prayer is that as we take
[1748.94 --> 1756.80]  this in, we would know that the one who came and conquered is without question coming again.
[1756.80 --> 1760.58]  And so, brothers and sisters, on the night Jesus was betrayed, He took bread.
[1760.58 --> 1765.96]  And after He had broken it, He gave thanks, saying to His disciples, this is My body.
[1765.96 --> 1768.96]  Do this in remembrance of Me.
[1768.96 --> 1785.36]  And when Paul talks about the Lord's Supper in 1 Corinthians 11, you know what he says
[1785.36 --> 1787.04]  at the end?
[1787.04 --> 1794.12]  Whenever we eat this bread and we drink this cup, we proclaim the Lord's death, what does
[1794.12 --> 1796.18]  he say next?
[1796.18 --> 1800.70]  Until He comes again.
[1800.70 --> 1807.26]  And so, brothers and sisters, this is the meal where you remember that we are free people.
[1807.26 --> 1809.46]  We are liberated people.
[1809.46 --> 1813.78]  And there is coming a day where you will taste and live in the fullness of that freedom and
[1813.78 --> 1819.76]  liberation when Jesus comes in glory.
[1819.76 --> 1825.84]  If you believe that Jesus Christ is Lord, Savior, and life, if this is your deepest conviction,
[1825.84 --> 1829.64]  you are invited to participate in this meal.
[1829.64 --> 1833.28]  And the way we're going to do it, as you've seen, is there's four stations, the front and
[1833.28 --> 1834.28]  the back.
[1834.28 --> 1838.28]  You can come up, take your elements, and you can actually eat them in your seats when you
[1838.28 --> 1839.28]  take your masks off then.
[1839.28 --> 1841.64]  There are gluten-free somewhere in there.
[1841.76 --> 1843.64]  I'm sure they're labeled with GF on them.
[1844.06 --> 1847.90]  But this is the meal of Christ for the body of Christ.
[1847.90 --> 1855.04]  So, take, eat, drink, remember, and believe that Christ has given Himself for the complete
[1855.04 --> 1856.92]  forgiveness of our sins.
[1856.92 --> 1860.92]  And that day is coming where we will taste the fullness of that freedom.
[1861.92 --> 1862.56]  Enjoy the meal.
[1864.98 --> 1867.42]  As you gather your elements, we're going to lead you in a song.
[1868.28 --> 1872.30]  Earlier in the service, Candy led us in a prayer, in a time of confession.
[1872.44 --> 1874.60]  If, like me, you found some things in your...
