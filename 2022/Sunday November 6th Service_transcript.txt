[0.00 --> 4.94]  after the night service,
[5.04 --> 6.16]  had someone come up to me and say,
[6.24 --> 7.50]  wow, I really love Brad's sermon.
[8.50 --> 10.42]  So I'm going to preach a footnote on Brad's sermon,
[10.48 --> 11.66]  but thank you, Brad, for that prayer.
[13.06 --> 14.52]  We're in the middle of our series on James.
[14.62 --> 17.36]  We actually have three sermons left on the book of James.
[17.54 --> 19.52]  And we're going to look at the return of Jesus today.
[19.98 --> 22.42]  Next week, we're looking at the power of prayer and healing.
[22.58 --> 23.54]  And the final week is,
[23.84 --> 25.62]  how do you approach someone who walks away from the truth,
[25.68 --> 27.24]  who walks away from who Christ is?
[27.24 --> 29.14]  So that's the richness of the wisdom
[29.14 --> 29.92]  that we're going to walk through,
[30.00 --> 31.58]  before we step into Advent.
[31.76 --> 33.36]  And yes, Advent is three weeks away.
[33.78 --> 34.66]  Where does time go?
[34.88 --> 35.42]  Here we are.
[36.50 --> 37.64]  Before we read the passage,
[37.76 --> 38.88]  I just want to make a quick note.
[39.42 --> 41.68]  We have a number of kids who finished Cornerstone
[41.68 --> 43.02]  and who are part of our worship service,
[43.10 --> 45.08]  and they do sermon journaling or sermon notes.
[45.42 --> 46.98]  And I know some parents are picking that up,
[47.02 --> 49.22]  but I just want to point out that in the foyer there,
[49.28 --> 50.02]  right outside the doors,
[50.12 --> 52.32]  there's a table there with clipboards and paper,
[52.50 --> 54.58]  pens and markers for any kids or adults
[54.58 --> 55.62]  who want to take sermon notes.
[55.72 --> 56.82]  They're there for you,
[56.94 --> 58.30]  so you're welcome to grab them.
[58.30 --> 60.72]  All right, if you have your Bible,
[60.84 --> 62.26]  turn with me to James chapter 5.
[62.52 --> 63.98]  We'll read the words.
[67.42 --> 68.52]  Starting in verse 7.
[68.52 --> 73.42]  Be patient then, brothers and sisters,
[73.68 --> 74.94]  until the Lord's coming.
[76.00 --> 77.66]  See how the farmer waits for the land
[77.66 --> 79.18]  to yield its valuable crop,
[79.52 --> 81.86]  patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains.
[82.54 --> 84.94]  You too, be patient and stand firm
[84.94 --> 87.04]  because the Lord's coming is near.
[87.72 --> 89.20]  Don't grumble against one another,
[89.28 --> 89.98]  brothers and sisters,
[90.06 --> 91.42]  or you too will be judged.
[91.88 --> 94.02]  The judge is standing at the door.
[94.02 --> 95.94]  Brothers and sisters,
[96.06 --> 97.62]  set as an example of patience
[97.62 --> 98.70]  in the face of suffering,
[99.06 --> 101.36]  take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
[101.94 --> 103.34]  As you know, we count as blessed
[103.34 --> 104.74]  those who have persevered.
[105.30 --> 106.70]  You have heard of Job's perseverance
[106.70 --> 108.76]  and have seen what the Lord finally brought about.
[109.18 --> 112.60]  The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
[112.60 --> 119.46]  I heard a story not that long ago
[119.46 --> 122.62]  of a community that was situated well below sea level.
[123.26 --> 125.22]  And there was this giant dam that was near
[125.22 --> 126.48]  that kept the community safe.
[126.56 --> 127.68]  And for a variety of reasons,
[128.00 --> 129.56]  that dam needed to be opened up
[129.56 --> 131.02]  and the community was going to get flooded.
[131.60 --> 133.12]  And the people living in this little community
[133.12 --> 135.08]  were given one year notice
[135.08 --> 136.50]  of that flooding that was coming.
[136.64 --> 137.22]  And they were actually,
[137.36 --> 138.56]  there's a line that they drew
[138.56 --> 139.28]  in all the buildings
[139.28 --> 140.66]  of how high the water was gonna be
[140.66 --> 142.28]  after they opened that dam up.
[142.28 --> 145.28]  So they had one year to prepare themselves
[145.28 --> 147.16]  for the flooding of their city.
[148.68 --> 150.46]  Guess what happened in that year?
[152.04 --> 153.08]  Very little happened.
[153.20 --> 154.70]  In fact, a lot of people, they moved away.
[154.84 --> 156.36]  The place was sort of becoming abandoned.
[156.50 --> 158.36]  Those who did stay didn't care for their homes
[158.36 --> 159.94]  because they knew they were gonna get flooded.
[160.32 --> 162.50]  And the place felt a bit like a ghost town.
[162.58 --> 164.14]  It had an apocalyptic feel to it.
[164.38 --> 166.06]  In that year between hearing the news
[166.06 --> 167.28]  that it was going to receive the flooding
[167.28 --> 168.58]  and the flooding itself.
[169.86 --> 171.00]  Now I tell this story
[171.00 --> 172.62]  because it's a very helpful illustration
[172.62 --> 175.22]  on how we view things in the future
[175.22 --> 177.46]  and how they shape the way we live in the present.
[178.22 --> 180.28]  And this is true on a big scale as well.
[180.62 --> 182.10]  Everybody has a belief
[182.10 --> 183.92]  about where the world's going.
[184.30 --> 184.90]  In fact, everyone,
[185.04 --> 185.74]  whether you know it or not,
[185.82 --> 186.56]  conscious or not,
[186.84 --> 187.76]  you have a belief about
[187.76 --> 188.84]  where the world came from,
[189.08 --> 190.02]  what's going on in it,
[190.08 --> 191.00]  and where it's all going
[191.00 --> 191.74]  and how it's gonna end.
[191.74 --> 193.04]  We all live out of a conviction.
[193.40 --> 194.74]  And our conviction and our belief
[194.74 --> 195.74]  about the end
[195.74 --> 197.78]  will shape the way you live in the present.
[198.46 --> 200.06]  The way that that flood being opened
[200.06 --> 201.38]  shaped how people lived
[201.38 --> 202.48]  in that year of interim.
[204.78 --> 205.64]  You need to know
[205.64 --> 208.58]  that when James talks about this passage,
[208.96 --> 210.68]  he starts by talking about
[210.68 --> 211.78]  the coming of the Lord.
[211.88 --> 213.46]  He's talking about the end.
[213.76 --> 215.28]  And so he's open up a conversation.
[215.94 --> 217.38]  And there's different takes on the end, right?
[217.48 --> 218.98]  And I think in our society,
[219.06 --> 219.56]  it's fair to say
[219.56 --> 220.86]  that there are many who believe,
[221.00 --> 222.10]  or used to believe, you might say,
[222.28 --> 223.68]  that through science and technology,
[223.68 --> 225.22]  we're gonna build a better world.
[225.44 --> 226.66]  We're gonna create that world,
[226.74 --> 227.32]  that good ending.
[227.40 --> 227.84]  We're gonna do that
[227.84 --> 228.78]  through science and technology.
[229.00 --> 229.50]  I have a feeling
[229.50 --> 230.74]  that that group is shrinking.
[231.28 --> 232.48]  I think we're realizing more and more
[232.48 --> 233.22]  that science and technology
[233.22 --> 234.42]  is becoming part of the problem,
[234.54 --> 235.38]  not just the solution.
[236.24 --> 237.24]  There's another group of people
[237.24 --> 237.76]  in our city,
[238.00 --> 238.68]  in our society,
[238.74 --> 239.02]  who say,
[239.12 --> 240.28]  no, we have overpopulated,
[240.36 --> 241.16]  we've overpolluted,
[241.40 --> 242.60]  we're destroying our environment.
[242.72 --> 244.08]  This world is headed for disaster.
[244.86 --> 245.70]  And there's an anxiety
[245.70 --> 246.32]  about the future.
[247.06 --> 247.94]  And even among Christians,
[248.06 --> 249.06]  I don't have time for it this morning,
[249.06 --> 249.70]  I could open up
[249.70 --> 250.92]  very different takes
[250.92 --> 252.24]  that believers have
[252.24 --> 253.24]  about what's gonna happen
[253.24 --> 253.76]  at the end,
[253.86 --> 254.74]  what the day of the Lord,
[254.82 --> 256.82]  what the end times are about.
[257.42 --> 258.76]  But James opens this up
[258.76 --> 259.60]  with this first phrase
[259.60 --> 260.18]  where he says,
[260.86 --> 261.38]  be patient,
[261.58 --> 262.30]  brothers and sisters,
[263.00 --> 265.00]  until the Lord's coming.
[265.78 --> 266.94]  And with that little phrase,
[267.08 --> 267.58]  I'm convinced
[267.58 --> 269.44]  that James brings to the fore
[269.44 --> 270.80]  the entire story of the Bible
[270.80 --> 272.26]  because he's talking about
[272.26 --> 273.32]  this person named the Lord
[273.32 --> 274.22]  who's coming.
[274.62 --> 275.32]  And the believers
[275.32 --> 276.22]  he's writing to know
[276.22 --> 277.12]  he's speaking of Jesus,
[277.24 --> 278.04]  the one who lived,
[278.04 --> 278.92]  who died,
[279.22 --> 280.00]  who resurrected,
[280.36 --> 281.18]  ascended to the Father
[281.18 --> 282.32]  and promised his return.
[282.38 --> 283.76]  He's bringing the story
[283.76 --> 284.34]  of the Bible
[284.34 --> 286.04]  and its hope for the future.
[287.30 --> 288.18]  Now, if you were here
[288.18 --> 288.52]  at Easter,
[288.66 --> 289.28]  you'll know that I took
[289.28 --> 290.14]  a giant whiteboard
[290.14 --> 291.22]  and I drew the whole story
[291.22 --> 291.60]  of the Bible.
[291.94 --> 292.94]  I'm not gonna tell you,
[292.98 --> 293.70]  though I was tempted.
[294.20 --> 295.50]  Instead, I put this really
[295.50 --> 298.08]  unbeautiful picture
[298.08 --> 299.24]  on the screen
[299.24 --> 300.44]  of the different arrows
[300.44 --> 301.12]  of the biblical story.
[301.18 --> 301.98]  And I think it'll be up there.
[302.36 --> 302.86]  There it is.
[302.86 --> 303.70]  There's my beautiful art.
[303.80 --> 304.40]  Someone took a picture
[304.40 --> 305.02]  of it at 9 a.m.
[305.02 --> 305.52]  and I was embarrassed
[305.52 --> 305.88]  because I'm like,
[305.96 --> 306.84]  I could have done a better job
[306.84 --> 307.28]  if I knew you were
[307.28 --> 307.64]  gonna take a photo.
[308.66 --> 309.38]  I'm gonna tell you
[309.38 --> 310.20]  the story of the Bible
[310.20 --> 311.76]  in a minute or so.
[311.90 --> 312.84]  This is also what I encourage
[312.84 --> 313.24]  all the people
[313.24 --> 314.10]  who take search to do.
[314.92 --> 316.08]  The story of the Bible
[316.08 --> 317.92]  begins with a beautiful creation.
[318.40 --> 319.16]  It's a good creation
[319.16 --> 320.32]  that God places us in
[320.32 --> 321.38]  to enjoy, cultivate,
[321.58 --> 323.12]  develop in the presence of God
[323.12 --> 323.96]  and with each other.
[324.12 --> 324.76]  There's harmony.
[325.68 --> 326.80]  Three chapters into the Bible,
[326.88 --> 327.42]  we get the story
[327.42 --> 328.42]  of human rebellion,
[328.42 --> 329.38]  often called the fall,
[329.48 --> 330.40]  but I like rebellion better,
[330.48 --> 331.34]  where humans say to God,
[331.62 --> 332.64]  we'll take it from here.
[332.76 --> 333.58]  We'll run the show.
[333.68 --> 334.24]  We don't need you
[334.24 --> 335.00]  to live our lives.
[335.10 --> 335.78]  And out of that
[335.78 --> 336.76]  comes this awful,
[337.22 --> 338.64]  catastrophic reality of sin,
[338.96 --> 339.96]  which I like to describe
[339.96 --> 341.52]  as a parasite or a cancer
[341.52 --> 343.16]  that infects our hearts
[343.16 --> 344.18]  and infects our world
[344.18 --> 345.30]  and brings about distortion
[345.30 --> 346.84]  and deterioration
[346.84 --> 347.90]  of God's good creation.
[348.76 --> 350.06]  God's response to that
[350.06 --> 352.14]  is to call a people, Israel.
[352.26 --> 352.82]  He says, Israel,
[352.92 --> 353.92]  I'm gonna bless you.
[354.22 --> 354.84]  I'm gonna make you
[354.84 --> 355.50]  a great nation.
[355.60 --> 356.74]  I'm gonna be present to you.
[356.74 --> 357.60]  I'm gonna teach you
[357.60 --> 358.52]  the way humans
[358.52 --> 359.38]  were supposed to live
[359.38 --> 359.94]  from the beginning
[359.94 --> 361.10]  and you're gonna be a blessing
[361.10 --> 361.98]  to all the nations.
[362.88 --> 363.64]  And that went terribly.
[364.46 --> 365.02]  And when that went
[365.02 --> 365.58]  into the ground,
[365.68 --> 366.62]  when Israel was just like
[366.62 --> 367.30]  all the other nations
[367.30 --> 368.06]  rejecting God,
[368.32 --> 369.34]  God says, this time,
[369.42 --> 370.08]  I'm gonna act.
[370.16 --> 370.90]  I'm sending myself.
[372.06 --> 373.16]  Jesus comes into history.
[373.58 --> 374.74]  He himself lives
[374.74 --> 376.12]  the perfect human life
[376.12 --> 377.24]  the way we were all created
[377.24 --> 378.24]  from the beginning to live
[378.24 --> 379.16]  with his words,
[379.42 --> 380.02]  his deeds,
[380.12 --> 380.96]  and his miracles.
[381.26 --> 382.30]  I often like to say here
[382.30 --> 383.38]  that Jesus' miracles
[383.38 --> 384.30]  are a snapshot
[384.30 --> 385.40]  of the way the world
[385.40 --> 386.24]  was supposed to be.
[386.58 --> 387.46]  No natural disasters,
[387.58 --> 387.96]  no sickness,
[388.06 --> 388.42]  no death,
[388.66 --> 389.60]  and a way the world
[389.60 --> 391.16]  will be when he returns.
[392.12 --> 392.78]  Then Jesus does
[392.78 --> 393.56]  what no other person
[393.56 --> 394.30]  has been able to do
[394.30 --> 395.70]  and that is he faces evil,
[395.80 --> 396.64]  he faces death,
[396.82 --> 397.58]  he faces sin,
[397.64 --> 398.60]  and he defeats it
[398.60 --> 399.66]  by the cross,
[399.84 --> 400.58]  giving up his life.
[401.50 --> 402.38]  Then doing what no one
[402.38 --> 403.36]  else saw coming as well
[403.36 --> 404.48]  and that is rising back
[404.48 --> 405.56]  to life from the dead.
[406.26 --> 407.46]  He ascends to the Father
[407.46 --> 407.88]  and he says,
[407.96 --> 408.62]  I'm coming again.
[409.20 --> 409.84]  But this is where
[409.84 --> 410.78]  we step into the story.
[410.92 --> 412.08]  Jesus fills us,
[412.16 --> 412.92]  sends the Spirit,
[413.04 --> 413.88]  and he says to the church,
[413.88 --> 415.28]  now you are sent
[415.28 --> 416.42]  to live the way
[416.42 --> 417.00]  you were created
[417.00 --> 417.96]  to live from the beginning,
[418.32 --> 419.84]  filled with the renewing power
[419.84 --> 420.90]  I gave you by the Spirit,
[421.10 --> 423.06]  and to share with the world
[423.06 --> 424.88]  that Jesus Christ is Lord
[424.88 --> 425.52]  and in him
[425.52 --> 426.72]  is the fullness of life.
[428.06 --> 429.40]  And the end of the story
[429.40 --> 431.30]  is not an arrow going up
[431.30 --> 432.48]  as people often say,
[432.86 --> 434.10]  it's Jesus returning.
[434.34 --> 435.26]  Revelation 22,
[435.78 --> 436.42]  a new heavens
[436.42 --> 437.64]  and a new earth
[437.64 --> 439.26]  where Jesus says to the world,
[439.40 --> 441.92]  I am making all things new.
[442.74 --> 443.92]  I'm building this creation
[443.92 --> 444.60]  to be perfect
[444.60 --> 445.48]  the way it was intended
[445.48 --> 446.10]  from the beginning,
[446.24 --> 446.90]  to live in,
[447.04 --> 447.54]  to enjoy,
[447.64 --> 448.12]  to cultivate,
[448.48 --> 450.20]  and enjoy in the presence of God.
[450.74 --> 451.82]  That's the story of the Bible.
[452.64 --> 453.30]  I'm telling this,
[453.34 --> 453.86]  yeah, I got an amen.
[454.00 --> 454.42]  Thank you, Jake.
[454.84 --> 456.68]  And the reason James is writing
[456.68 --> 457.24]  is he's saying,
[457.52 --> 459.48]  you church live right here.
[460.18 --> 462.20]  And we often talk about this era
[462.20 --> 463.26]  where we live,
[463.38 --> 464.30]  as well as the church
[464.30 --> 465.14]  in James' time,
[465.52 --> 466.62]  in the already not yet.
[466.68 --> 467.34]  They're experiencing
[467.34 --> 468.56]  the renewal of Jesus, right?
[468.62 --> 469.96]  They're experiencing the new life,
[470.22 --> 471.06]  the power that comes
[471.06 --> 471.64]  from the Spirit,
[471.92 --> 472.92]  but they're also realizing
[472.92 --> 474.30]  there's still oppression.
[474.80 --> 475.82]  There's still Roman boots
[475.82 --> 476.82]  that charge through
[476.82 --> 477.58]  the city streets.
[477.80 --> 478.80]  There's still greedy people
[478.80 --> 479.62]  destroying lives.
[479.72 --> 480.68]  There's still government leaders
[480.68 --> 481.58]  who are creating
[481.58 --> 482.90]  all sorts of havoc in the world.
[483.02 --> 484.06]  And so we're waiting
[484.06 --> 485.98]  for the return of Christ.
[486.38 --> 487.38]  We're waiting for Jesus
[487.38 --> 488.02]  to finally,
[488.62 --> 489.46]  once and for all,
[489.78 --> 490.96]  put an end to misery,
[491.78 --> 492.90]  stand against oppression,
[493.06 --> 493.82]  put away to evil
[493.82 --> 494.84]  those who oppose the kingdom,
[494.92 --> 496.68]  and establish his shalom forever.
[497.98 --> 499.26]  And it's important to know
[499.26 --> 499.96]  that James,
[500.16 --> 501.34]  this is such a beautiful point,
[501.34 --> 501.98]  he says to them,
[502.36 --> 503.06]  be patient,
[503.52 --> 505.00]  because they are eagerly
[505.00 --> 505.94]  waiting for it.
[506.78 --> 507.74]  That's an important point.
[507.80 --> 508.42]  Let me read for you
[508.42 --> 509.24]  how he starts.
[509.34 --> 509.50]  He says,
[509.58 --> 510.22]  be patient then,
[510.28 --> 510.88]  brothers and sisters,
[510.88 --> 512.12]  until the Lord's coming.
[512.80 --> 514.12]  See how a farmer waits
[514.12 --> 515.02]  for the land to yield
[515.02 --> 515.96]  its valuable crop,
[516.14 --> 516.96]  patiently waiting
[516.96 --> 517.54]  for the autumn
[517.54 --> 518.86]  and spring rains.
[520.56 --> 521.50]  See, if you look closely,
[521.80 --> 522.60]  patience is repeated
[522.60 --> 523.38]  three times
[523.38 --> 524.24]  in this short verse.
[525.20 --> 525.64]  So clearly,
[525.72 --> 526.22]  that's the center,
[526.30 --> 526.76]  but he wants them
[526.76 --> 527.22]  to be patient.
[527.30 --> 527.66]  He gives them
[527.66 --> 528.38]  three illustrations
[528.38 --> 528.78]  that we're going
[528.78 --> 529.52]  to open up today.
[530.06 --> 531.52]  But most striking to me
[531.52 --> 532.98]  is that James is writing
[532.98 --> 533.62]  to a church
[533.62 --> 534.80]  that is eager
[534.80 --> 536.24]  for Jesus to return.
[537.24 --> 538.04]  Think about that.
[538.34 --> 539.20]  When's the last time
[539.20 --> 539.90]  someone said to you,
[539.98 --> 540.48]  hey, hey, hey,
[540.54 --> 541.16]  whoa, whoa, whoa,
[541.16 --> 541.96]  be patient
[541.96 --> 542.82]  for Jesus' return?
[543.82 --> 544.74]  Is that being said
[544.74 --> 545.52]  to the church today
[545.52 --> 546.40]  in the West?
[546.84 --> 547.64]  I'm going to come back
[547.64 --> 548.20]  to that point.
[548.90 --> 549.48]  And the context
[549.48 --> 550.70]  is really important
[550.70 --> 551.28]  for this point.
[551.86 --> 552.48]  James is writing
[552.48 --> 553.24]  to people who are
[553.24 --> 554.96]  increasingly being oppressed.
[554.96 --> 556.04]  We talked about this
[556.04 --> 556.46]  at the beginning
[556.46 --> 557.04]  of the series.
[557.50 --> 558.28]  Christians are now
[558.28 --> 559.72]  losing positions of authority.
[559.88 --> 561.04]  They're being sort of mocked,
[561.14 --> 561.92]  at least publicly.
[562.08 --> 562.62]  It's no longer
[562.62 --> 563.64]  a popular idea.
[564.04 --> 564.76]  They're seeing
[564.76 --> 566.36]  the economic cost
[566.36 --> 567.46]  of being a Jesus follower
[567.46 --> 568.64]  and increasingly,
[569.10 --> 570.02]  they're losing safety.
[570.84 --> 571.84]  And you know what happens
[571.84 --> 572.84]  throughout church history
[572.84 --> 573.50]  whenever Christians
[573.50 --> 574.28]  enter into seasons
[574.28 --> 574.94]  of persecution
[574.94 --> 575.62]  and oppression?
[576.64 --> 578.08]  They start praying.
[578.64 --> 579.04]  And you know
[579.04 --> 579.72]  what they pray?
[580.70 --> 582.38]  Jesus come back.
[582.68 --> 583.18]  I mean, it's fitting
[583.18 --> 583.98]  that it just happens
[583.98 --> 585.42]  to be International Day of Prayer
[585.42 --> 586.42]  for the persecuted church
[586.42 --> 587.64]  because I promise you
[587.64 --> 588.34]  that churches
[588.34 --> 589.42]  who are gathering today,
[589.76 --> 590.46]  who are underground
[590.46 --> 591.58]  or have lost their buildings,
[591.68 --> 593.22]  who are being pushed away
[593.22 --> 593.84]  by leaders,
[594.06 --> 594.82]  they are praying,
[594.98 --> 596.66]  Jesus, Lord of the church,
[597.04 --> 597.78]  resurrected king,
[598.08 --> 599.78]  come back to heal this world.
[599.94 --> 600.88]  Get rid of this oppression.
[601.34 --> 602.72]  Deal with the forces of evil
[602.72 --> 603.46]  against the church
[603.46 --> 604.10]  and your world.
[605.32 --> 606.10]  And the believers
[606.10 --> 607.14]  in James' day
[607.14 --> 608.62]  are ready for that
[608.62 --> 609.50]  because they're oppressed,
[610.32 --> 611.48]  they're experiencing persecution,
[611.90 --> 612.94]  and they want Jesus,
[612.94 --> 614.22]  who they know can do it,
[614.30 --> 615.28]  to come and do his work
[615.28 --> 615.92]  and finish it.
[619.30 --> 620.18]  A main thing
[620.18 --> 620.88]  that James does
[620.88 --> 621.46]  with the church
[621.46 --> 623.02]  is encourage them.
[623.72 --> 624.70]  I mean, it's a tough show.
[624.98 --> 626.00]  And maybe you formed opinions
[626.00 --> 626.52]  about the church
[626.52 --> 627.18]  in James' time.
[627.26 --> 628.38]  I mean, they had division
[628.38 --> 629.02]  between the wealthy
[629.02 --> 629.46]  and the poor,
[629.58 --> 630.22]  there was favoritism,
[630.28 --> 630.76]  they had all sorts
[630.76 --> 631.34]  of brokenness,
[631.58 --> 632.72]  but they were following
[632.72 --> 633.70]  Jesus at a constant.
[634.32 --> 634.80]  And James,
[634.90 --> 635.54]  in this passage,
[635.70 --> 637.28]  really wants to encourage them.
[637.52 --> 638.08]  And he gives them
[638.08 --> 638.94]  sort of three ways
[638.94 --> 639.40]  of encouragement.
[639.54 --> 640.38]  One's the farmer image
[640.38 --> 641.22]  that we've already looked at.
[641.58 --> 642.14]  But he says,
[642.22 --> 643.58]  I want you to look at the prophets.
[644.74 --> 645.54]  He wants to encourage them
[645.54 --> 646.32]  by talking about the prophets.
[646.44 --> 646.76]  And now,
[646.96 --> 647.58]  I'm aware
[647.58 --> 648.68]  that the prophets
[648.68 --> 649.34]  in the Old Testament
[649.34 --> 650.86]  are probably one of the most
[650.86 --> 652.34]  under-read parts of the Bible.
[653.14 --> 654.04]  But if you read,
[654.12 --> 654.88]  and I encourage you
[654.88 --> 655.76]  to read the prophets,
[655.88 --> 656.28]  you will know
[656.28 --> 658.34]  that they had a tough go.
[658.96 --> 659.56]  They were people
[659.56 --> 660.18]  who had to learn
[660.18 --> 661.10]  to persevere.
[661.54 --> 662.40]  Some of the prophets,
[662.56 --> 663.14]  many of them,
[663.34 --> 664.18]  were told by God,
[664.26 --> 664.74]  here, come here,
[664.74 --> 665.38]  I'm going to give you
[665.38 --> 666.82]  a word to give to my people.
[666.98 --> 667.68]  Most of the prophets
[667.68 --> 668.58]  were speaking to Israel,
[668.70 --> 668.96]  by the way,
[669.06 --> 670.18]  some to other nations as well.
[670.64 --> 671.34]  I'm going to tell you
[671.34 --> 672.58]  to call them to repent
[672.58 --> 673.52]  because they're chasing
[673.52 --> 674.30]  after other gods
[674.30 --> 675.30]  that are leading to destruction.
[675.74 --> 676.84]  I want them to follow me
[676.84 --> 677.92]  and follow my ways.
[678.54 --> 679.44]  Some of these prophets,
[679.58 --> 680.08]  like Isaiah,
[680.14 --> 681.40]  were told in advance,
[681.54 --> 682.38]  just imagine this,
[683.02 --> 683.30]  Isaiah,
[683.42 --> 684.12]  I want you to preach
[684.12 --> 684.68]  to the people.
[685.58 --> 686.32]  Call them to repentance.
[686.56 --> 687.04]  And by the way,
[687.08 --> 687.44]  you're going to preach
[687.44 --> 687.94]  for decades
[687.94 --> 688.60]  and no one's going
[688.60 --> 689.20]  to listen to you.
[690.40 --> 690.76]  Decades.
[691.24 --> 691.94]  No one is going
[691.94 --> 692.56]  to listen to you.
[693.08 --> 694.42]  And Isaiah and Jeremiah
[694.42 --> 694.98]  and Amos,
[695.04 --> 695.96]  who had a tough word
[695.96 --> 696.44]  for the people,
[696.82 --> 697.78]  they listened to God,
[698.06 --> 699.24]  they spoke His word,
[699.36 --> 699.96]  and they trusted.
[699.96 --> 700.74]  This is the important
[700.74 --> 701.30]  piece of encouragement.
[701.42 --> 702.24]  They trusted that God
[702.24 --> 702.88]  was going to do
[702.88 --> 704.38]  what was most necessary
[704.38 --> 705.64]  in His own timing.
[706.68 --> 707.46]  They were patient
[707.46 --> 708.82]  and trusting the process.
[708.94 --> 709.52]  And the same is true
[709.52 --> 710.32]  of the second example
[710.32 --> 710.78]  of Job.
[711.32 --> 712.48]  James talks about Job.
[713.24 --> 714.10]  Now, in my family,
[714.30 --> 715.54]  we had this phrase
[715.54 --> 716.22]  for patient people.
[716.32 --> 716.48]  We said,
[716.56 --> 717.54]  oh, they have the patience
[717.54 --> 718.10]  of Job.
[718.74 --> 719.40]  Have you heard that phrase?
[719.48 --> 720.10]  Just my family?
[720.36 --> 720.58]  Okay.
[721.08 --> 721.48]  Never mind.
[721.94 --> 722.86]  It's a phrase we use.
[723.08 --> 723.88]  Apparently no one else does.
[724.48 --> 725.38]  But Job's a really
[725.38 --> 726.22]  powerful illustration.
[726.22 --> 726.98]  And for me,
[727.10 --> 727.98]  this is a significant one
[727.98 --> 728.78]  because when I was
[728.78 --> 729.24]  in university,
[729.44 --> 730.10]  I had a fixation
[730.10 --> 730.88]  with this book of Job
[730.88 --> 732.06]  because Job loses everything.
[732.28 --> 732.36]  Right?
[732.42 --> 733.00]  The story starts
[733.00 --> 733.92]  with Satan tempting him,
[734.26 --> 734.48]  saying,
[735.06 --> 736.42]  this guy will not follow God
[736.42 --> 737.90]  if his life gets hard.
[738.20 --> 738.86]  And Satan is allowed
[738.86 --> 739.62]  to sort of uproot
[739.62 --> 740.28]  all the goodness
[740.28 --> 741.06]  out of Job's life.
[741.10 --> 741.52]  His health,
[741.60 --> 742.00]  his family,
[742.10 --> 742.48]  his marriage,
[742.56 --> 742.96]  his kids,
[743.16 --> 743.88]  his livelihood,
[744.08 --> 744.78]  his body.
[745.06 --> 745.86]  All of these things
[745.86 --> 746.38]  he's experiencing
[746.38 --> 748.58]  extreme turmoil and pain.
[748.58 --> 750.48]  And yet he does not
[750.48 --> 751.38]  reject his faith.
[752.38 --> 753.44]  Doesn't turn in hatred
[753.44 --> 754.18]  towards God.
[754.42 --> 756.22]  He waits patiently
[756.22 --> 758.12]  for God's answer.
[758.68 --> 758.92]  In fact,
[758.96 --> 759.92]  one of my favorite passages
[759.92 --> 760.86]  in the book of Job
[760.86 --> 761.72]  is where he puts his hand
[761.72 --> 762.44]  over his mouth
[762.44 --> 764.16]  to hear God speak.
[764.52 --> 765.56]  Because he knows he's human
[765.56 --> 766.66]  and he knows God is God
[766.66 --> 768.18]  and he will wait for the Lord
[768.18 --> 769.98]  to do what the Lord sees fit
[769.98 --> 770.94]  in his own time.
[772.18 --> 773.60]  And James says to the church,
[774.08 --> 774.66]  look at the prophets.
[775.64 --> 776.34]  Look at Job.
[776.98 --> 778.08]  Be patient.
[778.58 --> 779.52]  in the difficulty.
[780.18 --> 781.38]  Trust that the Lord
[781.38 --> 782.38]  hears your cries.
[782.74 --> 783.54]  Trust that the Lord
[783.54 --> 784.04]  is at work
[784.04 --> 785.48]  and know that he is
[785.48 --> 786.90]  working out his will of good.
[788.22 --> 788.40]  You know,
[788.42 --> 789.34]  whenever I touch on passages
[789.34 --> 790.06]  about suffering
[790.06 --> 791.62]  or difficulty and perseverance,
[791.76 --> 792.82]  I think of one author
[792.82 --> 793.64]  basically summarized
[793.64 --> 794.64]  all the Bible's teaching
[794.64 --> 796.26]  on suffering and believers.
[796.38 --> 796.58]  He said,
[796.74 --> 797.12]  number one,
[797.92 --> 798.96]  suffering is never wasted
[798.96 --> 799.78]  in the hands of God.
[800.04 --> 800.68]  No matter what it is
[800.68 --> 801.92]  that church believers go through,
[802.32 --> 803.12]  it's never wasted
[803.12 --> 804.42]  in the hands of a sovereign God.
[804.48 --> 805.04]  He will use it
[805.04 --> 806.10]  to forge our character
[806.10 --> 807.72]  and make us to be like Jesus.
[807.72 --> 808.88]  That's what James 1 says.
[809.58 --> 810.10]  But secondly,
[810.48 --> 811.76]  and this is what our passage is about,
[812.18 --> 813.18]  there is coming a day
[813.18 --> 814.52]  when the suffering goes away.
[815.16 --> 815.82]  There is coming a day
[815.82 --> 816.38]  when the evil
[816.38 --> 816.92]  and the oppression
[816.92 --> 817.50]  and the violence
[817.50 --> 818.04]  and the opposition
[818.04 --> 818.96]  to God's good kingdom
[818.96 --> 820.86]  will be pushed aside
[820.86 --> 821.62]  by King Jesus
[821.62 --> 823.24]  and we wait for that day.
[823.24 --> 827.58]  In the middle of this passage
[827.58 --> 829.46]  is a very intriguing teaching
[829.46 --> 831.02]  that has drawn a lot of attention
[831.02 --> 832.28]  by people who have written
[832.28 --> 833.24]  commentaries on James
[833.24 --> 834.16]  and I want to read it for you.
[834.20 --> 835.52]  It starts in verse 11.
[836.90 --> 837.76]  Sorry, verse 8.
[839.42 --> 840.42]  This is what James writes
[840.42 --> 841.16]  starting in verse 8.
[841.16 --> 856.58]  Now when you hear that verse,
[856.70 --> 857.52]  what stands out to you?
[858.24 --> 858.82]  There's a few things.
[858.88 --> 859.20]  Obviously,
[859.54 --> 861.08]  he's giving an ominous warning
[861.08 --> 861.62]  to the church.
[861.70 --> 861.88]  Hey,
[862.38 --> 863.20]  when Jesus returns,
[863.30 --> 863.94]  you want to be busy
[863.94 --> 865.06]  being loving your neighbors,
[865.44 --> 866.34]  caring for those around you
[866.34 --> 867.92]  and not grumbling.
[869.26 --> 870.26]  But what really stands out
[870.26 --> 871.08]  to writers is
[871.08 --> 872.52]  two times in this passage,
[872.86 --> 874.06]  James seems to be suggesting
[874.06 --> 874.96]  that Jesus is coming
[874.96 --> 876.74]  like soon, right?
[877.08 --> 878.50]  The Lord's coming is near.
[878.74 --> 879.84]  The Lord, the judge,
[879.88 --> 881.46]  is standing at the door
[881.46 --> 883.04]  like he's right there.
[883.10 --> 884.54]  He can just walk in.
[886.08 --> 887.10]  And many commentaries,
[887.22 --> 887.70]  some of whom
[887.70 --> 888.80]  are not believing writers,
[888.90 --> 889.24]  they say,
[889.40 --> 890.28]  what's with that?
[891.08 --> 892.34]  Like James thought
[892.34 --> 893.76]  Jesus was coming back imminently.
[893.90 --> 894.74]  He was encouraging the church
[894.74 --> 895.36]  to be like ready
[895.36 --> 895.96]  for that moment
[895.96 --> 897.64]  and it's 2022
[897.64 --> 898.82]  and here we are
[898.82 --> 899.98]  and Jesus has not returned.
[900.94 --> 901.92]  Have you ever wondered about that?
[903.44 --> 904.18]  Some people,
[904.38 --> 905.12]  more critical people
[905.12 --> 905.38]  have said,
[905.48 --> 906.18]  well, there you go.
[906.30 --> 907.06]  These biblical writers
[907.06 --> 908.16]  didn't know what was going on.
[908.22 --> 908.82]  They got it wrong.
[908.90 --> 909.62]  They're a little eager,
[910.18 --> 911.18]  but they got it wrong.
[911.90 --> 912.30]  Some say,
[912.40 --> 913.48]  oh, they had what's called
[913.48 --> 914.14]  a over,
[915.04 --> 915.50]  what is it?
[915.52 --> 917.16]  Over-realized eschatology.
[917.46 --> 917.98]  That is to say,
[918.08 --> 918.96]  they were so eager
[918.96 --> 919.82]  for Jesus to come back,
[919.86 --> 920.54]  but they got it wrong.
[920.64 --> 921.08]  So, you know,
[921.18 --> 922.00]  what do we do with that?
[922.74 --> 923.64]  I'm of the mentality
[923.64 --> 924.44]  and I join the writers
[924.44 --> 924.88]  who say,
[924.88 --> 926.84]  perhaps what's most important
[926.84 --> 929.00]  is not that they thought
[929.00 --> 930.08]  Jesus could return
[930.08 --> 930.68]  in their lifetime.
[931.36 --> 932.58]  Perhaps what's most important
[932.58 --> 933.44]  is the posture
[933.44 --> 935.04]  they were fostering
[935.04 --> 935.52]  in the hearts
[935.52 --> 936.42]  and lives of believers
[936.42 --> 937.78]  of readiness
[937.78 --> 939.50]  and patience
[939.50 --> 940.48]  and anticipation
[940.48 --> 941.34]  of the glorious
[941.34 --> 942.32]  King Jesus returning.
[943.30 --> 943.64]  And again,
[943.68 --> 944.28]  I almost want to say,
[944.36 --> 944.74]  is that true
[944.74 --> 945.42]  of the church today?
[946.42 --> 947.48]  Because even if you have
[947.48 --> 948.22]  wonderings about
[948.22 --> 949.20]  why they got it wrong,
[949.42 --> 950.40]  we've got a lot of teaching
[950.40 --> 951.48]  from Jesus himself
[951.48 --> 952.34]  and in his parables,
[952.34 --> 953.80]  he's on and on
[953.80 --> 954.46]  and on again
[954.46 --> 955.90]  about how his return
[955.90 --> 956.98]  is going to be a surprise.
[957.80 --> 958.36]  No one's going to know
[958.36 --> 958.70]  the day.
[958.96 --> 959.46]  It's going to come
[959.46 --> 960.42]  like a thief in the night
[960.42 --> 961.28]  as Brad prayed about
[961.28 --> 961.80]  in his sermon.
[962.50 --> 963.54]  And it's going to be something
[963.54 --> 964.86]  that you want to be ready for
[964.86 --> 966.10]  because if you're on the wrong
[966.10 --> 967.16]  side of God's kingdom,
[967.30 --> 968.32]  it's not good news.
[969.74 --> 970.84]  And so I think we do well
[970.84 --> 971.28]  to say,
[971.58 --> 972.92]  perhaps what matters
[972.92 --> 973.34]  for us
[973.34 --> 974.02]  is to hear this
[974.02 --> 974.40]  and say,
[974.84 --> 976.16]  how do we become people
[976.16 --> 977.84]  who are ready
[977.84 --> 978.94]  for the day
[978.94 --> 979.78]  of Christ's return?
[979.78 --> 981.38]  And perhaps there's wisdom
[981.38 --> 982.38]  in living as though,
[982.50 --> 982.88]  who knows,
[982.92 --> 984.08]  it comes in our lifetime.
[984.74 --> 985.26]  Have you ever thought
[985.26 --> 985.70]  about that?
[987.70 --> 988.74]  And that brings me
[988.74 --> 989.88]  to what I want to spend
[989.88 --> 991.02]  quite a bit of time on today
[991.02 --> 991.64]  and that is,
[992.24 --> 992.86]  what do we do
[992.86 --> 994.18]  with a passage like this
[994.18 --> 995.84]  in North America,
[996.16 --> 997.12]  21st century,
[997.50 --> 998.34]  as Canadian believers?
[999.40 --> 1000.00]  Think about it.
[1000.06 --> 1000.64]  James is writing
[1000.64 --> 1001.80]  to a suffering church
[1001.80 --> 1003.24]  experiencing persecution
[1003.24 --> 1004.20]  who are eager
[1004.20 --> 1005.26]  for Jesus' return
[1005.26 --> 1006.20]  to be patient.
[1007.20 --> 1008.20]  Is that what James
[1008.20 --> 1009.34]  would say to us today?
[1010.22 --> 1011.10]  Is that what we need
[1011.10 --> 1011.52]  to hear?
[1011.62 --> 1012.18]  Because I think,
[1012.76 --> 1013.50]  and I could be wrong,
[1013.56 --> 1014.04]  you can correct me
[1014.04 --> 1014.58]  after today,
[1015.06 --> 1016.04]  I don't think we're
[1016.04 --> 1016.80]  living in persecution
[1016.80 --> 1017.48]  at this moment
[1017.48 --> 1018.40]  here in North America,
[1018.68 --> 1018.94]  Canada.
[1019.50 --> 1020.68]  I don't think we're
[1020.68 --> 1021.74]  eagerly anticipating
[1021.74 --> 1022.64]  the return of Jesus
[1022.64 --> 1023.30]  and I don't think
[1023.30 --> 1024.02]  James would necessarily
[1024.02 --> 1024.44]  have to say,
[1024.54 --> 1025.14]  hey, hey, whoa,
[1025.22 --> 1025.92]  North American church,
[1026.18 --> 1026.90]  be patient,
[1027.06 --> 1027.96]  wait for that day.
[1028.22 --> 1029.42]  I think in our comfort
[1029.42 --> 1031.58]  we have fallen asleep
[1031.58 --> 1032.96]  to the true story.
[1033.80 --> 1034.46]  Do you agree?
[1034.46 --> 1034.50]  Do you agree?
[1036.34 --> 1037.68]  Let me read a quote.
[1037.68 --> 1039.00]  This comes from a woman
[1039.00 --> 1040.12]  named Sylvia Kiesmat
[1040.12 --> 1041.38]  and it's actually
[1041.38 --> 1042.24]  an Advent reflection
[1042.24 --> 1042.86]  she wrote a number
[1042.86 --> 1043.32]  of years ago
[1043.32 --> 1044.20]  but when I read it,
[1044.26 --> 1044.86]  it just hit me
[1044.86 --> 1045.50]  between the eyes.
[1045.58 --> 1046.12]  So this is a quote
[1046.12 --> 1046.76]  that convicts me
[1046.76 --> 1047.28]  and I think it's going
[1047.28 --> 1048.14]  to convict all of us.
[1048.28 --> 1048.80]  She writes,
[1048.80 --> 1050.88]  for many Christians,
[1051.44 --> 1052.70]  the question of living
[1052.70 --> 1053.08]  in hope,
[1053.12 --> 1053.58]  she's talking about
[1053.58 --> 1054.34]  the return of Jesus,
[1054.86 --> 1056.08]  doesn't seem that urgent.
[1056.84 --> 1057.36]  Many of us have
[1057.36 --> 1058.32]  a pretty good life,
[1058.84 --> 1059.64]  jobs that put food
[1059.64 --> 1060.18]  on the table,
[1060.36 --> 1061.52]  holidays by the lake
[1061.52 --> 1062.26]  or seashore,
[1062.70 --> 1063.38]  enough clothes
[1063.38 --> 1064.26]  to keep us warm
[1064.26 --> 1064.72]  in the winter,
[1065.16 --> 1066.10]  a house or apartment
[1066.10 --> 1066.86]  with enough space
[1066.86 --> 1068.50]  for us and our toys
[1068.50 --> 1070.02]  and safety.
[1070.78 --> 1072.00]  We don't worry too much
[1072.00 --> 1072.76]  about whether we
[1072.76 --> 1073.58]  or our families
[1073.58 --> 1074.26]  will be alive
[1074.26 --> 1074.86]  in the morning.
[1075.52 --> 1076.50]  In such situations,
[1076.68 --> 1077.70]  the questions of the coming
[1077.70 --> 1078.24]  of the kingdom
[1078.24 --> 1079.90]  just isn't that pressing.
[1080.74 --> 1082.06]  We have it pretty good
[1082.06 --> 1082.76]  right now.
[1083.28 --> 1083.56]  Sure,
[1083.88 --> 1084.74]  we want to be with Jesus
[1084.74 --> 1087.74]  someday but not just yet.
[1088.66 --> 1089.68]  We have a movie or two
[1089.68 --> 1091.20]  trip we want to take
[1091.20 --> 1092.36]  before Jesus returns.
[1092.84 --> 1093.76]  It's no wonder
[1093.76 --> 1094.62]  that our lives
[1094.62 --> 1095.50]  aren't that different
[1095.50 --> 1096.10]  from those
[1096.10 --> 1097.46]  of our secular neighbors.
[1099.44 --> 1100.68]  How does that sit with you?
[1102.16 --> 1103.60]  It reminds me of a story
[1103.60 --> 1104.44]  I heard of a pastor
[1104.44 --> 1104.92]  who's preaching
[1104.92 --> 1105.86]  on the return of Jesus
[1105.86 --> 1107.14]  and he did this
[1107.14 --> 1107.72]  by a show of hands.
[1107.78 --> 1108.28]  I'm not going to do this
[1108.28 --> 1108.64]  in our church
[1108.64 --> 1109.32]  but I have a feeling
[1109.32 --> 1110.24]  we might do the same thing.
[1110.40 --> 1110.64]  He said,
[1110.72 --> 1111.32]  I want everyone
[1111.32 --> 1112.12]  by a show of hands
[1112.12 --> 1112.64]  to say,
[1112.74 --> 1113.86]  who wants Jesus to return?
[1115.02 --> 1115.96]  Everyone puts up their hand.
[1116.56 --> 1117.04]  And then he says,
[1117.16 --> 1117.76]  okay church,
[1118.08 --> 1118.84]  who wants Jesus
[1118.84 --> 1121.22]  to return right now?
[1122.22 --> 1122.74]  And then there's
[1122.74 --> 1123.20]  a bunch of people
[1123.20 --> 1123.58]  who are like,
[1124.86 --> 1126.48]  slowly putting their hand down
[1126.48 --> 1126.80]  because they want
[1126.80 --> 1127.20]  to be honest
[1127.20 --> 1127.72]  but they know
[1127.72 --> 1128.26]  they probably should
[1128.26 --> 1128.74]  have kept it up
[1128.74 --> 1129.06]  and there's like
[1129.06 --> 1130.18]  one old lady in the back
[1130.18 --> 1131.28]  just firmly ready,
[1131.42 --> 1132.40]  like late 90s,
[1132.60 --> 1133.48]  ready for it.
[1133.48 --> 1133.96]  Right?
[1135.24 --> 1136.12]  And it's worth asking,
[1136.20 --> 1137.04]  what's with that?
[1137.16 --> 1137.26]  Right?
[1137.30 --> 1137.80]  And there's a lot
[1137.80 --> 1138.88]  of reasons we ease out
[1138.88 --> 1139.84]  but here's the one thing
[1139.84 --> 1140.86]  that I'm convicted by
[1140.86 --> 1141.32]  personally.
[1142.36 --> 1143.72]  I think I am lulled
[1143.72 --> 1144.32]  to sleep
[1144.32 --> 1145.70]  by a different story.
[1146.74 --> 1147.60]  I think in the West
[1147.60 --> 1148.20]  there's a whole
[1148.20 --> 1148.90]  different narrative
[1148.90 --> 1150.18]  that governs our lives
[1150.18 --> 1151.28]  and shapes our way
[1151.28 --> 1151.94]  of seeing the future
[1151.94 --> 1152.48]  and the present
[1152.48 --> 1153.66]  that is more operative
[1153.66 --> 1154.06]  in the church
[1154.06 --> 1154.64]  than what I'm reading
[1154.64 --> 1155.48]  about here in James.
[1155.92 --> 1156.98]  And I feel convicted by it.
[1157.00 --> 1157.42]  I have a feeling
[1157.42 --> 1158.00]  that's going to be shared
[1158.00 --> 1158.94]  by us as believers.
[1159.38 --> 1160.38]  And if I could summarize,
[1160.58 --> 1161.06]  I don't have tons
[1161.06 --> 1161.70]  of time for this,
[1161.70 --> 1162.42]  but if I could summarize
[1162.42 --> 1164.10]  what I feel is the mood
[1164.10 --> 1165.90]  of our current society
[1165.90 --> 1166.54]  about the future,
[1166.66 --> 1167.80]  it's anxiety.
[1168.92 --> 1169.78]  There's not a confidence
[1169.78 --> 1170.80]  we're building a better world
[1170.80 --> 1171.14]  anymore.
[1171.24 --> 1171.88]  That may have been true
[1171.88 --> 1172.42]  in the 50s
[1172.42 --> 1173.36]  with technology, etc.
[1173.56 --> 1174.92]  There is a new anxiety
[1174.92 --> 1175.82]  about this world
[1175.82 --> 1176.56]  is getting destroyed,
[1176.68 --> 1177.52]  we're overpopulating,
[1177.64 --> 1178.64]  we're over all these things
[1178.64 --> 1179.06]  and people are like,
[1179.12 --> 1180.22]  this is not a good future.
[1180.66 --> 1181.78]  And what's happening,
[1182.20 --> 1182.96]  I think,
[1183.36 --> 1184.46]  is this sense of like,
[1184.80 --> 1186.42]  let's just live for the moment,
[1186.56 --> 1187.58]  let's go on that trip,
[1187.68 --> 1188.48]  let's eat good food,
[1188.58 --> 1189.08]  let's hang out
[1189.08 --> 1189.54]  with our friends
[1189.54 --> 1190.30]  because the future
[1190.30 --> 1191.54]  is a terrifying reality.
[1192.34 --> 1193.34]  Let's eat and drink
[1193.34 --> 1194.92]  for tomorrow we die.
[1196.30 --> 1197.30]  That's a sobering statement,
[1197.42 --> 1198.10]  but one person,
[1198.22 --> 1198.68]  one scholar,
[1198.84 --> 1200.02]  describes the state
[1200.02 --> 1200.80]  of our society
[1200.80 --> 1203.40]  as a cheerful nihilism.
[1204.56 --> 1204.92]  It's like,
[1204.98 --> 1205.90]  we know the future's bad,
[1206.16 --> 1206.86]  but we're going to try
[1206.86 --> 1207.36]  to live the best
[1207.36 --> 1208.16]  for the moment we have.
[1208.92 --> 1210.28]  And over and against that,
[1210.34 --> 1211.36]  here's for all it's worth,
[1211.76 --> 1212.56]  the scripture gives us
[1212.56 --> 1213.82]  a story where Jesus
[1213.82 --> 1215.94]  already defeated the enemy,
[1216.94 --> 1218.00]  where the church
[1218.00 --> 1218.66]  has the hope
[1218.66 --> 1220.06]  of an empty grave already,
[1220.06 --> 1221.74]  and we live with a hope
[1221.74 --> 1222.74]  of a king who already
[1222.74 --> 1223.48]  ascended to heaven
[1223.48 --> 1224.34]  to return
[1224.34 --> 1225.62]  to bring the glorious
[1225.62 --> 1226.70]  conclusion of his renewal
[1226.70 --> 1228.02]  that he's already sealed
[1228.02 --> 1228.78]  in the resurrection.
[1229.66 --> 1231.08]  That's a beautiful story.
[1231.72 --> 1232.42]  And I'm convinced
[1232.42 --> 1232.92]  that the church,
[1233.10 --> 1234.06]  when it comes alive
[1234.06 --> 1234.98]  in the scriptures,
[1235.12 --> 1235.50]  it will be like,
[1235.78 --> 1236.88]  this is good news
[1236.88 --> 1238.18]  for an anxious city,
[1238.40 --> 1239.40]  for a world that's fearful
[1239.40 --> 1240.08]  about the future.
[1240.34 --> 1241.82]  This is something worth sharing.
[1242.46 --> 1243.08]  Now I'm preaching.
[1243.08 --> 1247.58]  And so I want to ask
[1247.58 --> 1248.10]  the question,
[1248.28 --> 1249.32]  what I've been wrestling
[1249.32 --> 1249.96]  with this week is,
[1250.08 --> 1250.84]  it's good and fine
[1250.84 --> 1251.88]  for Pastor Dave to say,
[1251.94 --> 1252.86]  hey, we've got to be patient,
[1252.92 --> 1253.50]  we've got to be ready,
[1253.58 --> 1254.62]  we've got to be building
[1254.62 --> 1255.58]  that sense of anticipation
[1255.58 --> 1256.48]  for the return of Jesus.
[1256.72 --> 1257.46]  But the question that's
[1257.46 --> 1258.28]  swirling around my head is,
[1258.52 --> 1259.40]  how in the world
[1259.40 --> 1260.06]  do we do it?
[1260.66 --> 1261.50]  What are the practices
[1261.50 --> 1262.14]  and the habits
[1262.14 --> 1262.64]  and the rituals
[1262.64 --> 1263.46]  that we need to build
[1263.46 --> 1264.10]  into our lives
[1264.10 --> 1264.48]  that are going to be like,
[1264.66 --> 1265.90]  this is grounding us
[1265.90 --> 1266.72]  in the true story?
[1267.76 --> 1268.66]  Here's the first one.
[1269.26 --> 1270.00]  This is going to be
[1270.00 --> 1271.24]  like painstakingly obvious.
[1272.10 --> 1273.52]  Stay in the story.
[1274.56 --> 1275.40]  And by that I mean,
[1275.76 --> 1276.88]  ground your life
[1276.88 --> 1278.64]  in the word of Jesus Christ.
[1279.34 --> 1280.28]  I'm convinced that
[1280.28 --> 1282.50]  when this book is read regularly
[1282.50 --> 1283.46]  and when our lives
[1283.46 --> 1284.88]  are grounded in devotionally,
[1285.26 --> 1286.58]  we will be reminded again
[1286.58 --> 1287.54]  and again and again
[1287.54 --> 1288.72]  of what is true
[1288.72 --> 1289.90]  about us and the world
[1289.90 --> 1290.46]  and the future.
[1291.08 --> 1291.46]  And I don't know
[1291.46 --> 1292.06]  if this is just me,
[1292.12 --> 1292.98]  but I have it all the time
[1292.98 --> 1294.06]  where I'm like doing my devotions
[1294.06 --> 1294.34]  and I'm like,
[1294.46 --> 1295.62]  ah, right,
[1295.76 --> 1296.56]  that's what it means
[1296.56 --> 1297.12]  to be human.
[1297.72 --> 1299.04]  Or I'm reading about the future
[1299.04 --> 1299.98]  that's coming with Christ
[1299.98 --> 1300.16]  and I'm like,
[1300.28 --> 1300.48]  right,
[1300.48 --> 1301.54]  that's the hope
[1301.54 --> 1302.28]  that I need to hear
[1302.28 --> 1303.30]  again and again and again
[1303.30 --> 1304.70]  because when this is not
[1304.70 --> 1305.34]  in my life
[1305.34 --> 1306.28]  and your life,
[1306.76 --> 1307.96]  this Western story
[1307.96 --> 1309.64]  will build a new narrative
[1309.64 --> 1310.52]  for you to live out of.
[1311.28 --> 1312.54]  It will absorb your life
[1312.54 --> 1313.14]  and you'll be living
[1313.14 --> 1314.30]  out of a false narrative.
[1314.90 --> 1315.64]  It's a dangerous thing
[1315.64 --> 1316.44]  to do about the future
[1316.44 --> 1317.04]  and the present
[1317.04 --> 1317.66]  and about what it means
[1317.66 --> 1318.14]  to be human.
[1318.90 --> 1320.00]  Stay in the story
[1320.00 --> 1321.92]  and you will be reminded again
[1321.92 --> 1322.60]  that the king
[1322.60 --> 1324.10]  who defeated the grave
[1324.10 --> 1325.56]  is coming in glory
[1325.56 --> 1327.00]  and we have hope
[1327.00 --> 1327.92]  for the future.
[1327.92 --> 1330.98]  Secondly,
[1331.14 --> 1331.38]  amen,
[1331.38 --> 1334.54]  I don't know how to say this best
[1334.54 --> 1335.76]  but get close
[1335.76 --> 1336.44]  to the brokenness
[1336.44 --> 1336.88]  of the world.
[1337.82 --> 1338.52]  I'm convinced
[1338.52 --> 1339.30]  that it's when Christians
[1339.30 --> 1340.24]  get their arms
[1340.24 --> 1341.60]  and their hands dirty
[1341.60 --> 1342.16]  in the muck
[1342.16 --> 1342.68]  and the mire
[1342.68 --> 1343.22]  of this world,
[1343.36 --> 1344.34]  it builds in them
[1344.34 --> 1345.26]  a longing for Jesus
[1345.26 --> 1345.94]  to come back.
[1346.96 --> 1347.34]  I think,
[1347.68 --> 1347.98]  I mean,
[1348.06 --> 1348.38]  this is again,
[1348.40 --> 1348.98]  I read this article
[1348.98 --> 1349.70]  in Christianity Today
[1349.70 --> 1350.68]  just a couple weeks ago
[1350.68 --> 1351.62]  on how there's this new
[1351.62 --> 1352.56]  mentality of retreat.
[1353.28 --> 1354.02]  There's an anxiety
[1354.02 --> 1354.64]  around the future,
[1354.82 --> 1355.48]  anxiety around like
[1355.48 --> 1356.88]  the big geopolitical movements
[1356.88 --> 1357.40]  of the day
[1357.40 --> 1358.46]  and as people see
[1358.46 --> 1358.94]  what's happening
[1358.94 --> 1359.30]  in our world,
[1359.40 --> 1359.54]  they're like,
[1359.66 --> 1360.36]  oh my goodness,
[1360.46 --> 1361.14]  it's a mess
[1361.14 --> 1362.20]  and what happens
[1362.20 --> 1363.12]  in that moment is
[1363.12 --> 1364.00]  retreat.
[1364.34 --> 1365.06]  I'm going to find
[1365.06 --> 1365.88]  this safe little bubble,
[1365.94 --> 1366.44]  I'm just going to do
[1366.44 --> 1366.94]  my own thing,
[1367.12 --> 1368.16]  who cares about the world,
[1368.24 --> 1368.82]  I'm not going to think
[1368.82 --> 1369.14]  about that,
[1369.20 --> 1369.72]  we're just going to
[1369.72 --> 1370.56]  go to the cottage
[1370.56 --> 1371.36]  and have a good vacation,
[1371.48 --> 1371.96]  we're just going to
[1371.96 --> 1373.20]  spend a few hours gaming,
[1373.42 --> 1373.96]  hit Netflix,
[1374.08 --> 1374.82]  just stay in our home
[1374.82 --> 1375.50]  and do our own
[1375.50 --> 1376.52]  little bubble of safety
[1376.52 --> 1378.84]  and I just want to say
[1378.84 --> 1379.32]  at the outset,
[1379.86 --> 1380.74]  that is not the way
[1380.74 --> 1381.18]  of Christ.
[1382.08 --> 1382.94]  That is not what
[1382.94 --> 1383.78]  the church is called into.
[1384.48 --> 1384.74]  In fact,
[1384.80 --> 1385.30]  think about this,
[1385.48 --> 1385.84]  three weeks,
[1385.96 --> 1386.64]  Advent begins.
[1387.14 --> 1388.38]  What's the story of Advent?
[1389.32 --> 1390.28]  The story of Advent
[1390.28 --> 1390.88]  in a nutshell
[1390.88 --> 1392.16]  is God who knows
[1392.16 --> 1393.56]  how broken our world is
[1393.56 --> 1395.14]  sending Jesus Christ
[1395.14 --> 1396.56]  right into the thick
[1396.56 --> 1397.20]  of the mess
[1397.20 --> 1398.76]  and Jesus,
[1399.06 --> 1400.18]  who is fully God,
[1400.26 --> 1401.02]  showing how life
[1401.02 --> 1401.70]  is supposed to be,
[1401.92 --> 1402.62]  he reaches out
[1402.62 --> 1403.74]  and holds the sick,
[1404.64 --> 1405.76]  he dines with the outcast,
[1405.82 --> 1407.02]  he touches the leper,
[1407.10 --> 1407.84]  he doesn't have to do that
[1407.84 --> 1408.76]  but he touches them
[1408.76 --> 1410.20]  because he gets close
[1410.20 --> 1410.72]  to the mess
[1410.72 --> 1411.60]  and he announces to them,
[1411.94 --> 1412.78]  good news world,
[1413.42 --> 1414.70]  I have come to make it right.
[1414.70 --> 1415.98]  Good news,
[1416.08 --> 1417.14]  the sin that has mired
[1417.14 --> 1417.64]  my world,
[1417.96 --> 1419.16]  I am coming to defeat.
[1419.56 --> 1421.12]  Your king has come.
[1421.72 --> 1422.18]  Repent,
[1422.86 --> 1424.42]  believe the good news.
[1424.86 --> 1425.36]  And to everyone
[1425.36 --> 1426.26]  who follows Jesus,
[1426.66 --> 1428.06]  he says after his resurrection,
[1428.60 --> 1429.20]  wait for me,
[1429.72 --> 1430.54]  I'm coming again.
[1430.54 --> 1434.38]  I have a memorable story
[1434.38 --> 1435.32]  of going to India
[1435.32 --> 1437.44]  seven years ago or so
[1437.44 --> 1438.96]  and we're driving
[1438.96 --> 1439.58]  from the place
[1439.58 --> 1439.96]  where I was staying
[1439.96 --> 1440.56]  with some students
[1440.56 --> 1441.28]  back to the hotel
[1441.28 --> 1441.92]  and we're driving
[1441.92 --> 1443.16]  by this huge beach,
[1443.22 --> 1443.82]  it was like dusk
[1443.82 --> 1444.38]  so it was like,
[1444.76 --> 1444.98]  whichever,
[1445.20 --> 1446.28]  what's ever on that night,
[1446.46 --> 1447.08]  dusk or dawn,
[1447.14 --> 1447.56]  whatever it is,
[1447.96 --> 1448.48]  it was night
[1448.48 --> 1449.76]  and there's just like
[1449.76 --> 1450.92]  this beautiful long beach
[1450.92 --> 1451.94]  and just thousands
[1451.94 --> 1452.56]  upon thousands
[1452.56 --> 1453.34]  of people on this beach
[1453.34 --> 1454.54]  that I couldn't really make out
[1454.54 --> 1455.58]  and the driver
[1455.58 --> 1456.42]  who knew that
[1456.42 --> 1457.24]  I was new to the city,
[1457.36 --> 1457.50]  he said,
[1457.58 --> 1457.94]  you know that
[1457.94 --> 1458.94]  almost every single person
[1458.94 --> 1459.68]  on that beach is homeless.
[1460.88 --> 1461.50]  All these families,
[1461.60 --> 1462.42]  lots of kids on the beach,
[1462.54 --> 1463.14]  they all live
[1463.14 --> 1464.04]  in these makeshift huts
[1464.04 --> 1465.20]  and their existence
[1465.20 --> 1466.30]  is hoping every day
[1466.30 --> 1467.20]  to catch another fish
[1467.20 --> 1468.16]  in the sea,
[1468.56 --> 1469.06]  eat that fish
[1469.06 --> 1469.78]  and stay alive.
[1470.50 --> 1472.32]  And I've never in my life
[1472.32 --> 1473.44]  seen that many people
[1473.44 --> 1474.18]  homeless
[1474.18 --> 1475.42]  and it just broke me
[1475.42 --> 1476.60]  and I remember even now,
[1476.64 --> 1477.30]  oh, I'm getting emotional,
[1478.22 --> 1478.96]  I was in the car,
[1479.00 --> 1479.16]  I'm like,
[1479.26 --> 1480.80]  Jesus, I can't fix this.
[1481.60 --> 1482.68]  This is crazy.
[1482.92 --> 1484.34]  We need you to fix this
[1484.34 --> 1486.18]  and I prayed for Jesus to come
[1486.18 --> 1488.46]  and I have a hunch
[1488.46 --> 1490.00]  that you've had many experiences
[1490.00 --> 1490.92]  just like this.
[1491.30 --> 1491.82]  Maybe it's serving
[1491.82 --> 1492.56]  in the community kitchen
[1492.56 --> 1493.98]  and just seeing the brokenness
[1493.98 --> 1494.70]  in our own city
[1494.70 --> 1495.82]  of the complexity
[1495.82 --> 1496.44]  of homelessness
[1496.44 --> 1497.10]  and those who are
[1497.10 --> 1498.02]  economically vulnerable
[1498.02 --> 1499.12]  going through mental illness
[1499.12 --> 1499.60]  and addiction.
[1499.80 --> 1500.56]  It's a mess.
[1501.58 --> 1502.44]  Or perhaps you felt
[1502.44 --> 1503.30]  that same longing
[1503.30 --> 1503.90]  when you're helping
[1503.90 --> 1505.60]  this very disabled child
[1505.60 --> 1506.78]  get dressed in the morning
[1506.78 --> 1509.40]  or walking with a friend
[1509.40 --> 1510.16]  through the heavy
[1510.16 --> 1511.26]  darkness of depression
[1511.26 --> 1514.54]  or burying a loved one.
[1515.28 --> 1515.90]  I mean, as a pastor,
[1515.96 --> 1516.48]  I've been in a number
[1516.48 --> 1516.94]  of funerals
[1516.94 --> 1517.66]  and there's so many times
[1517.66 --> 1518.30]  where someone buries
[1518.30 --> 1518.76]  a loved one,
[1518.98 --> 1519.96]  especially if they're
[1519.96 --> 1520.94]  younger than them,
[1521.54 --> 1521.98]  where you just think,
[1522.10 --> 1523.52]  oh man, Jesus,
[1523.68 --> 1524.48]  I can't raise people
[1524.48 --> 1524.94]  from the dead,
[1525.12 --> 1525.82]  but you can.
[1526.58 --> 1527.60]  And so you need to come
[1527.60 --> 1528.78]  and you need to do something
[1528.78 --> 1529.38]  about this mess
[1529.38 --> 1530.78]  because we can't fix it
[1530.78 --> 1531.80]  and we need you
[1531.80 --> 1532.88]  who raises life
[1532.88 --> 1533.50]  from the death
[1533.50 --> 1534.42]  to do it.
[1535.04 --> 1535.80]  Come Lord Jesus,
[1536.60 --> 1537.48]  heal your world.
[1538.40 --> 1539.12]  And I'm convinced
[1539.12 --> 1539.84]  that people
[1539.84 --> 1541.28]  who get their hands dirty
[1541.28 --> 1542.56]  in the mess of the world
[1542.56 --> 1543.64]  will be people
[1543.64 --> 1544.44]  who cry
[1544.44 --> 1545.48]  and pray
[1545.48 --> 1546.24]  for Jesus
[1546.24 --> 1546.86]  to return.
[1549.66 --> 1550.50]  Final point.
[1552.72 --> 1553.60]  I want to finish
[1553.60 --> 1554.06]  with words
[1554.06 --> 1554.80]  from 2 Peter.
[1555.50 --> 1556.18]  This passage
[1556.18 --> 1556.62]  is written
[1556.62 --> 1557.38]  to believers
[1557.38 --> 1558.10]  who need to be told
[1558.10 --> 1558.64]  to be patient.
[1558.78 --> 1559.26]  May it be said
[1559.26 --> 1559.96]  of the church today,
[1560.26 --> 1560.94]  but I want to finish
[1560.94 --> 1561.46]  with a passage
[1561.46 --> 1562.20]  about patience
[1562.20 --> 1562.88]  and it's not about
[1562.88 --> 1563.74]  patience we need,
[1563.98 --> 1564.40]  the patience
[1564.40 --> 1565.22]  of our Heavenly Father.
[1565.64 --> 1566.52]  Every time I preach
[1566.52 --> 1567.28]  on the return of Jesus,
[1567.48 --> 1567.92]  I come back
[1567.92 --> 1568.60]  to this passage.
[1568.98 --> 1569.92]  Memorize it as a kid,
[1569.98 --> 1570.72]  it's ministered to me
[1570.72 --> 1571.50]  for many years.
[1571.92 --> 1572.50]  Here it is.
[1572.50 --> 1573.96]  This is from 2 Peter 9,
[1574.18 --> 1574.94]  2 Peter 3.
[1576.94 --> 1578.26]  The Lord is not slowing
[1578.26 --> 1579.86]  in keeping His promise
[1579.86 --> 1581.82]  as some understand slowness.
[1582.94 --> 1583.24]  Instead,
[1583.46 --> 1584.22]  He is patient
[1584.22 --> 1585.82]  with you,
[1587.26 --> 1588.20]  not wanting anyone
[1588.20 --> 1588.86]  to perish,
[1589.34 --> 1590.12]  but everyone
[1590.12 --> 1591.58]  to come to repentance.
[1592.76 --> 1593.48]  Did you hear it?
[1594.60 --> 1595.90]  If you've had rattling
[1595.90 --> 1596.52]  around your head
[1596.52 --> 1596.98]  the question,
[1597.22 --> 1598.24]  why hasn't Jesus
[1598.24 --> 1598.96]  come back?
[1599.28 --> 1600.56]  There's Peter's answer
[1600.56 --> 1601.22]  to your question.
[1601.22 --> 1603.04]  The Lord is patient
[1603.04 --> 1603.84]  with you.
[1604.48 --> 1605.24]  He has pushed,
[1605.34 --> 1605.88]  this is how I like
[1605.88 --> 1606.24]  to put it,
[1606.48 --> 1607.56]  Jesus when He first came,
[1608.08 --> 1608.62]  people thought
[1608.62 --> 1609.20]  He was a king
[1609.20 --> 1610.22]  that was going to destroy
[1610.22 --> 1610.96]  oppression, evil
[1610.96 --> 1611.58]  right there and then
[1611.58 --> 1612.02]  and they actually
[1612.02 --> 1612.92]  didn't believe in Him
[1612.92 --> 1613.74]  because there were still
[1613.74 --> 1614.76]  Romans on the ground
[1614.76 --> 1615.86]  doing evil things.
[1616.18 --> 1617.22]  And what Jesus is saying
[1617.22 --> 1617.42]  is,
[1617.88 --> 1619.60]  I'm delaying judgment
[1619.60 --> 1621.74]  so that the good news
[1621.74 --> 1622.92]  of Jesus, Him,
[1623.00 --> 1623.92]  can go out to the world.
[1624.66 --> 1626.00]  I'm delaying judgment
[1626.00 --> 1626.70]  and it's coming,
[1626.98 --> 1627.34]  trust me.
[1627.60 --> 1628.04]  There's a day
[1628.04 --> 1629.26]  where every single opposition
[1629.26 --> 1629.70]  to the kingdom
[1629.70 --> 1630.32]  of Jesus Christ
[1630.32 --> 1631.62]  will be done away with.
[1632.18 --> 1632.88]  And for some people
[1632.88 --> 1633.78]  that's bad news
[1633.78 --> 1634.34]  but Jesus is saying,
[1634.62 --> 1635.62]  I'm pushing back the end
[1635.62 --> 1636.48]  so you can make
[1636.48 --> 1637.16]  the good news known.
[1638.12 --> 1638.96]  I'm pushing back the end
[1638.96 --> 1639.70]  so you can live
[1639.70 --> 1640.26]  and experience
[1640.26 --> 1641.06]  a resurrection life
[1641.06 --> 1641.36]  of Jesus
[1641.36 --> 1642.78]  and invite everyone
[1642.78 --> 1643.52]  into it.
[1643.56 --> 1644.10]  And I tell you what,
[1644.14 --> 1644.96]  if there's ever a verse
[1644.96 --> 1645.62]  that gets me thinking
[1645.62 --> 1646.30]  about evangelism,
[1646.52 --> 1647.24]  that's the one.
[1648.30 --> 1649.06]  Because mission is not
[1649.06 --> 1649.68]  just an activity
[1649.68 --> 1650.32]  of the church,
[1650.56 --> 1651.50]  it's the era
[1651.50 --> 1652.60]  that we live in.
[1653.28 --> 1653.78]  And I don't think
[1653.78 --> 1654.26]  we get that.
[1654.52 --> 1655.46]  Mission is the era
[1655.46 --> 1655.96]  we live in.
[1656.00 --> 1656.80]  The reason Jesus
[1656.80 --> 1657.76]  hasn't come back
[1657.76 --> 1658.82]  is because he wants
[1658.82 --> 1659.40]  more people
[1659.40 --> 1660.70]  in more places
[1660.70 --> 1662.18]  to repent and believe
[1662.18 --> 1663.10]  in the good news.
[1666.06 --> 1667.02]  So church,
[1667.64 --> 1669.00]  take heart.
[1669.94 --> 1670.82]  The grave is empty,
[1671.72 --> 1672.86]  the king is coming,
[1673.38 --> 1675.32]  and we can live in hope.
[1676.38 --> 1677.02]  Let's pray.
[1677.02 --> 1684.34]  Lord, open our ears
[1684.34 --> 1685.14]  to hear this word
[1685.14 --> 1685.76]  for the church.
[1686.86 --> 1687.92]  And teach us to believe
[1687.92 --> 1688.46]  that you actually
[1688.46 --> 1689.02]  are coming.
[1690.26 --> 1691.26]  Teach us to have
[1691.26 --> 1691.90]  a faith
[1691.90 --> 1693.84]  that lives in hope.
[1695.08 --> 1696.50]  The pain and brokenness
[1696.50 --> 1697.18]  we walk through
[1697.18 --> 1697.84]  to cause us
[1697.84 --> 1699.68]  to long for your return.
[1700.18 --> 1701.16]  And help us to pray
[1701.16 --> 1702.30]  with those who suffer,
[1702.72 --> 1703.86]  with those who run
[1703.86 --> 1704.54]  for their lives,
[1704.58 --> 1705.20]  and with those
[1705.20 --> 1705.98]  who are persecuted,
[1705.98 --> 1707.14]  to pray that you
[1707.14 --> 1707.72]  come back
[1707.72 --> 1709.12]  and heal your world.
[1710.14 --> 1710.94]  Come soon,
[1711.06 --> 1711.56]  Lord Jesus,
[1712.14 --> 1713.14]  and make us faithful
[1713.14 --> 1714.18]  as we wait.
[1714.88 --> 1715.14]  Amen.
[1718.86 --> 1719.54]  We're going to sing
[1719.54 --> 1720.50]  a song of response.
[1720.90 --> 1722.04]  This is by Porter's Gate.
[1722.16 --> 1722.42]  It's called
[1722.42 --> 1722.88]  How Long
[1722.88 --> 1723.84]  Might Be New to Some of Us,
[1723.92 --> 1725.44]  Not Super New to Others of Us.
[1725.86 --> 1726.74]  But this is basically
[1726.74 --> 1728.04]  singing for Jesus
[1728.04 --> 1728.60]  to come back.
[1728.64 --> 1729.28]  And I invite you to stand
[1729.28 --> 1729.96]  as we sing together.
[1729.96 --> 1730.04]  Amen.
