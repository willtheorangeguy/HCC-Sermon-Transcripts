[0.00 → 6.76] This morning we are going to continue our series entitled Honest Prayers,
[6.86 → 9.80] where we've been going through a number of psalms,
[9.80 → 17.32] and we've been taking note how all the psalmists express their hearts honestly toward God.
[17.82 → 20.42] And some of these prayers are pretty raw prayers.
[20.56 → 22.18] Some of them are prayers of praise.
[22.30 → 24.14] Some of them are prayers of lament.
[24.14 → 31.46] We are now going to pray the Psalm 121, which is a psalm of ascent.
[32.46 → 35.72] Psalm 120 through 134 are called psalms of ascent.
[35.72 → 36.44] Now why that?
[37.48 → 43.20] Because they were used by the pilgrims travelling to Jerusalem to the temple for one of the three yearly festivals.
[43.38 → 47.98] I put the verse down where we kind of get this idea of why they have to go.
[48.42 → 52.18] In Deuteronomy 16, 16, way back in the Old Testament, we read,
[52.18 → 59.16] Three times a year all your men must appear before the Lord your God at the place he will choose,
[59.50 → 64.12] at the festival of unleavened bread, the festival of weeks, and the festival of tabernacles.
[64.22 → 65.98] No one should appear before the Lord empty-handed.
[66.58 → 70.28] And so they were needed once there was a temple.
[70.70 → 73.74] It used to be a tabernacle, which was kind of a travelling temple.
[73.74 → 84.74] And the temple was then the place where they were to go to bring their offerings and their hearts to God.
[85.86 → 92.78] In general, these psalms are called psalms of ascent because ascent is about going up.
[93.76 → 97.00] And Jerusalem is built on a hill, so you had to go up.
[97.00 → 102.52] But there's a spiritual component to that too, about spiritually going up.
[103.84 → 107.86] Do you know, it's one of the fun parts of writing a sermon, you start researching.
[108.00 → 113.58] I read some stuff, you know, some speculate that the psalms of ascent, Psalm 121-134,
[113.86 → 116.00] are some of the steps of the temple.
[116.98 → 119.90] And there are 15 steps and 15 psalms.
[119.90 → 125.52] And then you have this picture of the Levites on the harps and the lyres and trumpets and songs being sung
[125.52 → 127.04] and people going up these stairs.
[127.40 → 129.26] And you have this amazing worship moment.
[130.10 → 131.80] So that's kind of the picture here.
[132.38 → 137.66] The message of these psalms is that Jerusalem is a place for God's people to come together
[137.66 → 139.86] to worship the Lord their God.
[140.74 → 147.38] To confess, to give thanks, to remember God's mighty acts of the past and His ongoing and forever presence.
[147.38 → 153.36] And with that in mind, and I know it was read to you once, but let's read it again, Psalm 121.
[153.90 → 154.62] Read it with me.
[157.22 → 160.90] I will lift my eyes to the hills, to the mountains.
[161.82 → 163.10] Where does my help come from?
[164.26 → 167.84] My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.
[168.14 → 169.90] He will not let your foot slip.
[170.06 → 172.84] He who watches over you will not slumber.
[173.38 → 176.64] Indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
[176.64 → 178.24] The Lord watches over you.
[178.32 → 180.36] The Lord is your shade at your right hand.
[180.64 → 182.98] The sun will not harm you by day nor the moon by night.
[183.16 → 185.46] The Lord will keep you from all harm.
[185.80 → 187.14] He will watch over your life.
[187.52 → 191.66] The Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.
[191.66 → 196.48] And we see two voices in the psalm, verse 1 and 2.
[196.66 → 199.30] We have this question asked, where did my help come from?
[199.52 → 202.60] Then you have this confession by this individual or group of travellers.
[203.04 → 210.10] And then verse 3 through 8, we have this response by possibly a priest, people not travelling, maybe friends and relatives.
[210.36 → 212.92] And they say those other things in verse 3 through 8.
[212.92 → 218.32] I want you to imagine these travellers from all over the place, far and wide.
[219.42 → 223.48] Remind yourself, travel is by foot, right?
[223.54 → 227.56] There are no cars, no rapid transit, nothing like that.
[227.84 → 231.44] And these people are from all over the place, even outside of Israel.
[231.44 → 240.20] Most are simple folk, coming from small villages, farms, hardworking people, families, most not rich.
[240.74 → 243.12] And they come a long way to go to the temple.
[243.74 → 244.22] To what?
[244.44 → 247.22] To lift their eyes.
[248.16 → 253.24] To lift their eyes to the hills of Jerusalem, to the temple of God.
[254.58 → 259.16] There are a lot of hills though on the way for getting to Jerusalem.
[259.16 → 263.06] And those hills have threats.
[264.20 → 265.38] There are robbers in them.
[265.46 → 270.16] We think of the parable of the Good Samaritan, where the Good Samaritan finds a beat up man.
[270.52 → 272.06] He was robbed in the hills.
[272.26 → 273.16] That's the picture there.
[273.64 → 278.32] In the ancient world, the hills, they're often called high places.
[278.88 → 282.10] And they are places for pagan gods and spirits.
[282.62 → 284.74] And they're shrines scattered through the hills.
[284.74 → 284.80] And they're in the hills.
[284.80 → 291.32] My wife and I had the privilege of going to Israel, Egypt, and Jordan on a trip.
[292.02 → 296.10] And when we were in a place called Petra, some of you might know it from Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[296.18 → 299.08] This amazing kind of a place to see.
[299.16 → 300.58] But anyway, we were going to Petra.
[300.64 → 302.46] Then we walked around Petra for quite a while.
[302.84 → 306.14] And then our guide said, hey, you want to go up to a high place.
[306.14 → 308.66] And we went up the side path.
[309.04 → 310.66] And we climbed way up.
[310.72 → 312.58] There are these steps carved in.
[313.16 → 315.70] I was one of the old guys, so I was slowing everybody down.
[316.52 → 318.02] But we made it to the top.
[318.10 → 319.40] And there was one of these high places.
[319.48 → 321.12] And you can see kind of the ruins.
[321.80 → 324.88] And you could see where there were probably sacrifices.
[325.56 → 328.50] They had little canals for the blood to run.
[328.96 → 332.20] I mean, it was one of these high places for a false god.
[332.20 → 340.34] And the psalmist says, I lift my eyes to the hills.
[341.86 → 343.68] And we might ask, well, which hills?
[345.16 → 346.06] Which hills?
[346.92 → 351.06] The ones that promise power aside from Yahweh or not?
[352.58 → 354.78] Israel had this problem quite often.
[354.98 → 359.12] If you go through your Old Testament, they got sidetracked by false gods.
[359.12 → 363.86] They had the Ashe rah poles and, you know, Baal worship.
[364.04 → 365.92] And a lot of that was done on hills.
[366.60 → 369.50] And so, yeah, where are you lifting your eyes?
[369.80 → 370.66] Which hills?
[371.08 → 372.68] And this almost says, no, no, no, I'm not.
[372.76 → 374.62] I'm lifting my eyes to the hills.
[374.88 → 375.56] Yeah, I'm doing that.
[375.72 → 377.98] But not to look for the hills for anything.
[378.24 → 380.54] But to the maker of those hills.
[380.62 → 382.18] The maker of heaven and earth.
[382.56 → 384.60] That's who I'm lifting my eyes up to.
[384.60 → 387.82] I'm not getting caught up in the hills.
[388.62 → 391.68] I'm getting caught up in the maker of those hills.
[393.82 → 400.48] In the Apostles' Creed, a confession that binds Christian churches together,
[400.98 → 403.00] we start off, I believe in God the Father Almighty.
[403.58 → 404.94] Maker of heaven and earth.
[405.00 → 406.34] Let's define who we're talking about here.
[406.58 → 407.66] God the Father Almighty.
[407.78 → 408.16] Which one?
[408.50 → 410.32] The maker of heaven and earth.
[411.10 → 411.60] That one.
[411.60 → 414.60] That's where my help comes from.
[415.30 → 417.26] Not from some false gods we've created.
[417.60 → 419.62] Not from some self-help plan I made.
[419.92 → 422.88] Not from some lie I'm embracing and pretending it's the truth.
[423.20 → 423.44] No, no.
[423.88 → 425.14] The maker of heaven and earth.
[425.22 → 426.30] That's where my help comes from.
[426.90 → 430.84] And that phrase occurs a couple of times in some other places in the Songs of Ascent.
[431.06 → 433.08] Because it's one of the central truth.
[433.76 → 436.60] We worship the maker of heaven and earth.
[437.40 → 438.18] That's our God.
[438.18 → 443.94] And if we're going to go up, which is the picture here.
[444.66 → 444.92] Up.
[445.98 → 446.38] Allah.
[446.88 → 447.16] Up.
[447.34 → 448.14] The Hebrew word for up.
[448.68 → 451.60] Then we need to keep our eyes on that.
[451.70 → 452.54] And that theme comes through.
[452.64 → 453.94] I put some, there are lots of references.
[454.44 → 455.68] Isaiah 40, 26.
[456.62 → 460.06] The prophet says, lift your eyes and look to the heavens.
[460.40 → 462.10] Who created all these?
[462.10 → 468.60] He who brings out the starry host one by one calls forth each of them by name.
[468.84 → 472.74] Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.
[472.88 → 473.00] Right?
[473.10 → 473.86] That God.
[474.56 → 479.82] In the New Testament, in the book of Hebrew, we read, therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witness,
[479.98 → 484.10] let's throw off everything that distracts and hinders us and the sin that's so easily entangled.
[484.32 → 486.54] Let's run our race with perseverance.
[486.70 → 487.74] The race marked out for us.
[488.04 → 488.56] And here we go.
[488.56 → 490.80] We're fixing our eyes.
[491.66 → 492.04] Where?
[492.76 → 497.90] On Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
[498.42 → 501.60] scorning its shame, and he sat down at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty.
[502.32 → 504.32] The Lord is our helper.
[504.76 → 506.34] Lift your eyes to him.
[508.78 → 510.32] And it's not automatic.
[511.86 → 513.28] Because we're easily distracted.
[514.42 → 515.32] The Lord is our helper.
[516.06 → 518.52] The Hebrew word is ever, E-Z-E-R.
[519.18 → 521.14] It's 65 times mentioned in the Old Testament.
[521.90 → 523.90] One story about the Ebenezer stone.
[524.10 → 524.22] Right?
[524.26 → 525.02] You can look that up.
[525.40 → 526.56] The stone of help.
[527.06 → 528.08] This is our God.
[528.40 → 530.90] The word helper was also used for Eve.
[530.98 → 531.18] Right?
[531.62 → 534.54] And sometimes I think we downgrade the word help.
[536.12 → 537.86] You know, think, well, a helpmate.
[538.06 → 540.44] You know, as if it's an inferior position.
[540.98 → 542.32] It refers to God.
[542.32 → 546.98] God is our ever, our help.
[547.94 → 549.60] You know, Eve was Adam's help.
[549.96 → 554.90] This is not a this is a profoundly powerful statement to be one's help.
[554.90 → 560.00] It's so easy for us to get distracted by the struggles we face.
[560.98 → 563.24] Yeah, yeah, there are bandits in those hills.
[563.32 → 564.44] No doubt about it.
[565.36 → 567.96] Yeah, the sun is beating down on us.
[568.16 → 569.40] Water is scarce.
[569.40 → 573.34] We, we, you know, travelling has its risk.
[573.58 → 579.72] When my wife and I, when we, we walked through some of this territory, when we were in Palestine
[579.72 → 584.46] and Israel, and we walked through the territory, and I mean, this was a stark land.
[584.92 → 585.82] Intense heat.
[587.14 → 589.54] Not, not this 30 degree lightweight stuff.
[590.84 → 591.72] Intense heat.
[592.04 → 592.26] Right?
[592.26 → 592.30] Right?
[592.70 → 593.98] 40 was fairly normal.
[595.28 → 595.52] Right?
[595.62 → 597.48] You know, and then you, then you got to do stuff.
[597.88 → 599.40] Yeah, the Lord will keep you from all that.
[599.58 → 601.60] The Lord will keep you.
[603.04 → 604.28] I like that picture.
[604.40 → 604.96] Will keep you.
[605.02 → 607.50] The Hebrew word has a sense of watch overprotect.
[608.36 → 611.78] The word occurs six times in those eight verses of Psalm 121.
[612.10 → 613.38] God is active.
[613.90 → 615.52] The psalmist lists his attributes.
[615.52 → 615.76] Right?
[615.90 → 618.50] He keeps you from slipping because we tend to slip.
[619.06 → 619.20] Right?
[619.50 → 621.18] He is always on the watch.
[621.18 → 623.58] He shelters you from the sun and the moon.
[626.20 → 630.76] Some of you wonder, like, why are we talking about the moon?
[632.22 → 633.12] I mean, the sun, I get.
[633.92 → 634.10] Right?
[634.34 → 635.38] It beats down anybody.
[635.92 → 638.04] The sun and the moon represent deities.
[639.88 → 640.96] You think of Egypt.
[641.44 → 641.70] Ra.
[642.02 → 642.84] He was a sun god.
[644.40 → 645.08] Mesopotamian god.
[645.22 → 645.48] Nana.
[646.08 → 646.52] Moon god.
[646.92 → 647.74] Doesn't mean grandma.
[648.86 → 649.96] Grandmas are not deities.
[649.96 → 652.54] Even though they might like to be sometimes, but they're not.
[653.86 → 658.90] The picture here is the word, is the moon caused mental illness in a way.
[659.24 → 660.48] We get our word lunatic.
[661.22 → 662.22] You have the word lunar.
[662.92 → 663.28] Lunatic.
[663.86 → 664.92] I even put one verse down.
[665.02 → 667.72] Matthew 4.24 out of the King James.
[668.04 → 669.86] Just look at it with me.
[669.86 → 673.88] And Jesus' fame went throughout all Syria.
[673.88 → 681.76] And they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments,
[681.90 → 690.20] and those who were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had palsy, and he healed them.
[690.20 → 693.34] But you hear that word lunatic, moonstruck.
[694.78 → 700.24] And the psalm is saying, Yahweh protects us from all evil.
[701.84 → 702.56] All evil.
[702.66 → 703.38] Whatever's out there.
[706.22 → 713.12] Travellers surely observed these other worship sites, right, devoted to these other gods, whose followers claimed ordered the cosmos.
[713.12 → 719.94] And to say, God is our helper, the maker of heaven and earth, is to declare that these other gods are imposters.
[723.16 → 724.76] The psalmist says, our God doesn't sleep.
[725.48 → 731.78] It's interesting, if you're really a student, you're going to find out that there are some psalms that talk about God sleeping.
[733.04 → 736.44] So then don't come back to me and say later on, hey, wait a minute, you said God doesn't sleep.
[736.44 → 742.94] Remember, these are honest prayers, and there are times when the psalmist says, I don't know why God's not responding to my needs.
[743.22 → 744.42] He must be sleeping.
[745.54 → 745.80] Right?
[745.88 → 748.68] And there's that honest praying going on there.
[749.02 → 752.02] But the psalmist here says, God doesn't sleep.
[752.08 → 755.96] In other words, he doesn't stop watching over you.
[757.60 → 761.32] For these other gods, they slept.
[761.98 → 763.76] Sometimes it was a seasonal thing, right?
[763.76 → 768.28] They slept for a long period of time, or died sometime, and then it was winter.
[769.14 → 773.18] And we have the stories, the mythological stories of explaining the seasons that way.
[774.06 → 777.28] Israel's God is ever vigilant, and he's your shade.
[777.94 → 781.20] Really important in a hot area, especially as you travel in that heat.
[782.28 → 789.08] And this protective shade that God offers us, it's not a guarantee that we're not going to face any struggles.
[789.08 → 792.78] No, rather, it is God's abiding presence in the midst of those struggles.
[794.66 → 797.98] With any hill or mountain, there are valleys, right?
[798.70 → 800.22] You go down, now you're in a valley.
[800.48 → 802.22] In dark places, and God's there too.
[805.14 → 807.58] It made me think of Psalm 23.
[808.62 → 811.16] I put the one verse on there, Psalm 23, verse 4.
[811.16 → 816.22] Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
[816.26 → 817.90] You're riding your staff, they comfort me, right?
[818.30 → 823.14] And we have that picture of this God going with us through the darkest places, often used at funerals.
[823.48 → 825.88] Because God goes through the valley of the shadow of death.
[827.42 → 828.86] And he sees us through the other side.
[831.82 → 833.46] Some of you know those dark places.
[834.70 → 837.88] And I hope you know that God is there with you, leading you to the other side.
[837.88 → 840.96] These psalmists know there are many dangers.
[841.14 → 845.08] There are diseases, there's injury, war, disaster, depression, theft, evil, falsehood.
[845.32 → 848.06] And he asks, where does my help come from?
[849.44 → 850.54] Where does my help come from?
[850.66 → 853.80] Which is the right question to ask right from the start.
[853.80 → 857.58] It's a good place to start.
[857.70 → 859.00] People of God, let me ask you this.
[859.64 → 863.92] When you face life's challenges and hardships, where does your help come from?
[866.74 → 867.88] Where does your help come from?
[869.06 → 870.16] You can look to the hills.
[871.88 → 874.50] You can look to false gods and lies.
[875.76 → 877.62] Or you can look to your maker, your creator.
[878.36 → 880.82] Who is your keeper and your helper as you come and go.
[880.92 → 882.82] And he watches over your whole life now and forever.
[883.80 → 890.28] In Jewish life, Psalm 121, particularly verse 7 and 8.
[891.26 → 892.54] Let me read it to you once more.
[892.68 → 894.18] Verse 7 and 8.
[894.34 → 896.06] I'll just jump to it here.
[896.96 → 898.58] The Lord will keep you from all harm.
[898.66 → 899.82] He'll watch over your life.
[899.94 → 902.80] The Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.
[903.66 → 909.46] In Jewish life, that verse was posted in the delivery room or in the child's room.
[909.46 → 912.16] It was said as people left to go travel.
[912.16 → 914.58] What a wonderful blessing.
[914.80 → 916.20] Yes, there are lots of threats.
[916.98 → 919.22] But our God, our helper, our keeper, he's always with us.
[921.54 → 924.28] Journeying is a good picture of what life is.
[924.36 → 924.86] We journey.
[926.20 → 927.76] I love the stories of Abraham.
[928.10 → 932.08] Abraham left home for a promised land and a promised people.
[932.08 → 939.08] He was going to get, you know, as far as, you know, the sand of the shore and the stars in the sky.
[939.14 → 940.60] That's how many descendants you're going to have here.
[941.00 → 945.94] When Abraham died, he had one son and a burial plot.
[948.16 → 951.30] A far cry from a great land and great people.
[951.30 → 953.66] I put Hebrews 11.
[954.18 → 957.26] If you want to read a psalm, we'll talk about journeys.
[958.18 → 958.90] Hebrews 11.
[959.04 → 959.84] This is about Abraham.
[960.42 → 961.10] Hebrews 11, 8.
[961.60 → 966.72] By faith, Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went,
[966.98 → 968.38] even though he didn't know where he was going.
[969.20 → 969.34] Right?
[969.38 → 970.82] Abraham, Abraham, I want you to go.
[970.88 → 971.10] Where?
[971.28 → 971.70] Just go.
[971.88 → 972.08] Okay.
[972.64 → 976.10] By faith, he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country.
[976.10 → 980.94] He lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.
[981.36 → 985.18] For he was looking forward to a city with foundations whose architect and builder is God.
[985.38 → 987.68] He had his eyes focused.
[989.16 → 995.84] And by faith, even Sarah, who was past childbearing age, was unable to bear a child because she considered him faithful who made the promise.
[996.62 → 1004.48] And so from this one man, as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sands on the seashore.
[1004.48 → 1009.12] And all these people were still living by faith when they died.
[1009.66 → 1012.02] They did not receive the things promised.
[1012.12 → 1018.76] They only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth.
[1024.10 → 1026.46] We are travelling through.
[1029.28 → 1030.24] For now.
[1030.24 → 1043.18] And this God promises us his protection and his presence, this time forward and forevermore for life's whole journey.
[1043.72 → 1048.38] From baptism to death.
[1048.38 → 1053.36] I've had the privilege of being a pastor for a long time.
[1055.14 → 1060.12] And seeing people who I baptized, buried their parents.
[1061.54 → 1065.16] And the promise of the Lord's presence was in that baptism.
[1065.60 → 1068.46] And the promise of the Lord's presence was in that death.
[1069.46 → 1070.62] And everything in between.
[1070.62 → 1076.92] Psalm 121 is such a comforting psalm in so many circumstances.
[1077.66 → 1079.62] Often recited in significant times.
[1079.96 → 1082.08] Reminding those listening to lift their eyes.
[1083.48 → 1084.96] Sonia prayed for anxiety.
[1085.10 → 1089.12] I went through a period of pretty devastating anxiety in my life.
[1089.26 → 1091.78] And had a hard time carrying on.
[1092.80 → 1094.50] Needed a lot of support.
[1094.50 → 1098.26] This psalm meant a lot to me at the time.
[1099.58 → 1099.74] You know.
[1100.66 → 1102.16] Lift your eyes to the hills.
[1102.64 → 1104.02] Because my tendency.
[1104.46 → 1106.70] And my anxiety was to look down.
[1106.84 → 1108.32] To look at what was wrong.
[1108.48 → 1110.02] Look at how I couldn't manage.
[1110.14 → 1110.98] Look at, look at, look at, look at.
[1112.00 → 1113.92] I lift my eyes to the hills.
[1114.00 → 1114.86] Oh, look at those hills.
[1114.94 → 1115.52] Look at those mountains.
[1115.62 → 1116.32] And I'd look at the mountains.
[1116.38 → 1116.92] I'd look outside.
[1116.98 → 1117.40] I'd see the mountains.
[1118.08 → 1119.82] From where does your help come?
[1119.94 → 1121.10] Not looking down here.
[1121.10 → 1122.78] From where does your help come?
[1122.78 → 1125.26] It comes from, well, not those mountains.
[1125.52 → 1126.96] But from the maker of those mountains.
[1127.24 → 1130.00] And I felt some encouragement in thinking that way.
[1134.62 → 1135.72] Lift your eyes.
[1137.08 → 1138.00] To the hills.
[1138.40 → 1138.88] To the Lord.
[1139.20 → 1139.64] To the maker.
[1141.50 → 1142.30] It's interesting though.
[1142.32 → 1143.44] Sometimes that's hard to do.
[1143.76 → 1145.24] And it made me think of Psalm 3.
[1145.40 → 1146.78] Which I preached on in July.
[1147.20 → 1148.02] Psalm 3.3.
[1148.40 → 1149.32] Notice what it says here.
[1149.32 → 1152.02] But you, Lord, are a shield around me.
[1152.02 → 1152.84] My glory.
[1153.20 → 1155.20] The one who lifts my head high.
[1155.50 → 1156.72] And isn't that a beautiful picture?
[1156.98 → 1159.12] Sometimes I can't do this.
[1161.98 → 1164.44] And I need the Lord to lift my head.
[1164.52 → 1166.22] And I see, I see a parent.
[1166.62 → 1167.14] A parent.
[1167.24 → 1168.38] And the kid is crying.
[1168.48 → 1169.26] And the kid is hurt.
[1169.50 → 1170.32] And he's looking down.
[1170.62 → 1172.34] And that parent comes down on the knee.
[1172.58 → 1173.78] And lifts that kid's head up.
[1173.82 → 1174.64] Says, it's going to be okay.
[1175.42 → 1176.28] It's going to be okay.
[1176.28 → 1178.32] That's the picture.
[1179.66 → 1181.20] The Lord lifts your head up.
[1181.32 → 1181.72] And says, ah.
[1182.46 → 1183.66] Now you see who's with you.
[1184.98 → 1186.06] Now you see who's with you.
[1187.62 → 1188.66] Lift your eyes.
[1188.88 → 1190.16] And the Lord will help you do that too.
[1190.38 → 1191.98] To the maker who is always at work.
[1192.84 → 1195.76] And so these pilgrims travel to see the face of the Lord in the temple.
[1196.08 → 1198.32] And they travel through a particular landscape.
[1199.02 → 1199.28] Their minds.
[1200.06 → 1200.50] Their hearts.
[1200.62 → 1201.82] Their bodies were involved.
[1201.82 → 1203.72] I like that picture too.
[1204.20 → 1207.66] I like that the body and the mind and everything is involved.
[1208.10 → 1208.54] Pilgrimages.
[1209.48 → 1211.08] Some people do something called the El Camino.
[1211.98 → 1214.88] Which is in Europe and Spain and France I think.
[1216.42 → 1218.14] I went to a place called Iona.
[1218.94 → 1219.88] Island of Scotland.
[1220.66 → 1221.92] And you have these pilgrimages.
[1222.90 → 1224.46] I read stories of priests.
[1224.96 → 1228.52] You know, a poor priest on the coast of Scotland.
[1228.84 → 1229.92] They'd hop into a boat.
[1230.26 → 1231.12] They'd put up a sail.
[1231.12 → 1232.40] And they'd just float.
[1233.42 → 1235.68] And the idea that God's going to lead me where I need to go.
[1236.42 → 1237.96] I'm not sure if that's a great idea.
[1241.42 → 1243.02] I'd like a bit more plan than that.
[1243.30 → 1247.10] But, you know, I've heard of, and I've done it myself too.
[1247.20 → 1248.76] Going to the mission in mission.
[1249.64 → 1249.82] Right?
[1249.98 → 1251.36] And go for a prayer walk.
[1251.46 → 1257.42] I mean, I like that our bodies, our minds, our whole being gets to be part of it.
[1257.42 → 1259.74] And I think, you know, going to Jerusalem, right?
[1260.34 → 1260.54] Yeah.
[1260.62 → 1262.62] We were blessed with a trip to Jerusalem.
[1262.76 → 1265.48] We walked the lands Jesus walked.
[1265.48 → 1271.42] I mean, we walked where Mount Nebo, where Moses went up his last climb.
[1272.46 → 1275.26] But the body was involved in the head and the heart.
[1276.62 → 1277.52] Do some prayer walks.
[1278.48 → 1278.84] Right?
[1278.84 → 1280.42] I had one with my dogs.
[1280.96 → 1282.00] I had two big dogs.
[1282.24 → 1284.46] And, again, going through a bit of a tough time.
[1284.52 → 1285.66] And I'd do the same walk every day.
[1285.74 → 1288.78] And I had this big rock that I'd sit on and let the dogs run loose.
[1289.54 → 1290.58] And it was my prayer walk.
[1290.68 → 1292.26] It was my prayer rock as well.
[1292.26 → 1297.02] I think it's why it's essential for us to get together.
[1298.60 → 1300.08] And actually get up.
[1300.86 → 1302.16] And actually go.
[1302.48 → 1303.52] And actually drive.
[1303.68 → 1305.92] And actually have to do the physical stuff to get here.
[1306.22 → 1307.10] I think that's important.
[1308.28 → 1308.82] I really do.
[1312.18 → 1313.14] This psalm.
[1314.00 → 1317.34] This psalm begins with the world as it is.
[1317.50 → 1318.38] Full of uncertainties.
[1318.56 → 1319.32] A daunting world.
[1319.32 → 1322.32] And it starts with a state of helplessness.
[1323.26 → 1324.68] Where does my help come from?
[1324.74 → 1325.86] Because I need help.
[1325.98 → 1326.12] Right?
[1326.14 → 1327.28] I love that start here.
[1327.52 → 1330.16] The exact state we should be starting each day with.
[1331.36 → 1332.48] You get up in the morning.
[1334.26 → 1335.20] Look in the mirror.
[1335.60 → 1336.60] Recover from that sight.
[1340.46 → 1341.80] And then stay.
[1342.80 → 1343.08] All right.
[1343.10 → 1343.74] Here's today.
[1345.06 → 1346.62] Where's my help going to come from today?
[1346.62 → 1349.52] Start the day that way.
[1350.20 → 1351.86] Where am I going to look for help today?
[1352.00 → 1352.92] Because I'm going to need help.
[1354.10 → 1354.26] Right?
[1354.90 → 1355.38] You know.
[1355.42 → 1356.92] It's such a wonderful thing.
[1357.32 → 1358.42] It's going to come from my maker.
[1358.82 → 1359.66] Or from hills.
[1361.72 → 1364.04] And then we hear the voice of our community.
[1364.32 → 1364.90] And again.
[1365.24 → 1365.84] So in the beginning.
[1365.94 → 1366.72] Where does my help come from?
[1366.90 → 1368.08] And then verse 3 through 8.
[1368.36 → 1368.62] Hey.
[1368.80 → 1369.78] The community shows up.
[1370.06 → 1371.22] God is our helper.
[1371.32 → 1371.92] Remember that.
[1372.12 → 1372.94] He's our keeper.
[1372.94 → 1373.54] Remember that.
[1373.66 → 1374.42] Now and forever.
[1374.42 → 1376.56] And I need to hear that from you.
[1376.72 → 1378.86] And you need to hear that from one another.
[1379.26 → 1380.22] God is our helper.
[1380.58 → 1381.68] God is our keeper.
[1384.14 → 1387.60] Lift your eyes to the maker of the hills.
[1389.86 → 1392.54] These pilgrims travel together affirming God's presence.
[1392.70 → 1394.54] Because sometimes if we're on our own.
[1394.72 → 1395.40] We don't feel it.
[1396.14 → 1399.58] Travel together recalling the ways in which God had cared for them in the past.
[1399.58 → 1404.54] Binding together as a community of past and present and future.
[1405.64 → 1406.28] That's why I love it.
[1406.30 → 1406.94] Hebrews 12.
[1407.38 → 1409.80] Which says we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses.
[1410.40 → 1412.40] I love that as we did the baptism today.
[1412.94 → 1416.40] Miles is surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses.
[1417.46 → 1419.66] Including the ones of the past.
[1420.10 → 1422.78] The ones who have gone on and live in glory.
[1423.16 → 1423.88] Those two.
[1423.88 → 1425.08] But this moment.
[1425.48 → 1427.94] You are a cloud of witnesses to one another.
[1428.64 → 1431.06] And you witness to God's mighty acts.
[1431.48 → 1432.06] When we.
[1432.26 → 1433.42] When I might forget.
[1438.82 → 1440.08] And we walk together.
[1440.22 → 1441.12] And we sing together.
[1441.62 → 1442.96] United by a common purpose.
[1443.44 → 1444.94] And a shared destination.
[1446.24 → 1447.24] A shared destination.
[1447.24 → 1448.24] All.
[1450.12 → 1451.62] All of us need to be encouraged.
[1452.12 → 1453.14] To lift our eyes.
[1453.68 → 1456.10] To the one who watches over all our comings and goings.
[1456.16 → 1456.74] Now and forever.
[1459.06 → 1460.40] Knowing who's in charge.
[1462.36 → 1463.04] I finish.
[1463.68 → 1465.00] I'll finish with a couple of verses.
[1465.18 → 1467.06] That Jesus talked about lifting heads.
[1468.04 → 1469.58] The first verse in Luke 21.
[1470.04 → 1471.50] Jesus is talking about the end of times.
[1473.12 → 1474.10] The end of times.
[1474.68 → 1475.50] And you know.
[1475.58 → 1475.90] You may say.
[1475.98 → 1476.10] Okay.
[1476.20 → 1476.64] One time.
[1476.64 → 1476.96] So.
[1477.26 → 1477.68] In other words.
[1477.80 → 1477.92] You know.
[1477.98 → 1478.22] There is.
[1478.30 → 1479.34] There is going to be an end.
[1479.68 → 1480.92] And Jesus will return.
[1481.24 → 1482.26] We anticipate that.
[1482.36 → 1483.18] We live in the in between.
[1483.30 → 1483.46] Right.
[1483.52 → 1484.22] Between the cross.
[1484.34 → 1485.78] And the end of times here.
[1486.18 → 1487.08] And Jesus is saying.
[1487.08 → 1487.36] Okay.
[1488.78 → 1489.76] You can get caught up.
[1489.84 → 1490.34] And looking around.
[1490.52 → 1491.20] All kinds of things.
[1491.30 → 1491.98] But then he says this.
[1492.42 → 1492.74] When you.
[1492.90 → 1493.76] When these things.
[1493.88 → 1494.92] All the end of time stuff.
[1495.24 → 1496.24] Begin to take place.
[1496.66 → 1497.34] Stand up.
[1497.48 → 1498.06] And now here we go.
[1498.52 → 1499.82] Lift your head.
[1499.90 → 1501.20] Because your redemption is drawing near.
[1501.54 → 1502.68] Sometimes we can get caught up.
[1502.70 → 1504.14] In all the activities we have around us.
[1504.18 → 1505.18] And I know we have to.
[1505.62 → 1506.20] Deal with life.
[1506.20 → 1508.50] But we forget to look up and say.
[1508.66 → 1510.46] We are actually on a destination.
[1510.92 → 1512.22] That goes forever.
[1515.14 → 1516.28] And at some point.
[1516.52 → 1518.64] Your physical journey is going to end here.
[1519.84 → 1521.10] But the journey carries on.
[1524.10 → 1524.54] And so.
[1524.74 → 1525.48] While we're at it.
[1525.94 → 1527.62] Then Jesus is in John 4.35.
[1528.00 → 1528.76] He's talking about.
[1528.82 → 1529.46] So what do we do here?
[1529.66 → 1530.62] Do not say then.
[1530.84 → 1532.26] There are yet four months.
[1532.68 → 1533.82] Then comes the harvest.
[1533.82 → 1534.38] Look.
[1534.38 → 1534.70] Look.
[1534.70 → 1535.02] Look.
[1535.28 → 1535.80] I tell you.
[1535.94 → 1536.80] Lift your eyes.
[1537.08 → 1538.76] And see that the fields are white for harvest.
[1538.98 → 1540.44] Now what are we lifting our eyes for?
[1540.66 → 1541.90] We're lifting our eyes.
[1542.10 → 1542.88] To look around.
[1543.14 → 1543.74] Who's the harvest?
[1543.96 → 1545.10] All the people around you.
[1545.30 → 1545.94] That's the harvest.
[1546.28 → 1546.88] God is saying.
[1547.16 → 1548.00] Those are hearts.
[1548.12 → 1549.80] That need to be refocused.
[1550.12 → 1550.96] Those are heads.
[1551.16 → 1552.64] That need to be lifted.
[1553.38 → 1554.18] Get out there.
[1554.50 → 1555.84] Show them that I love them.
[1555.84 → 1561.16] Don't just go amongst your tasks.
[1561.16 → 1562.82] Without ever looking up.
[1563.08 → 1564.86] And remembering the grand task.
[1565.06 → 1566.40] That you've been called to.
[1573.12 → 1574.16] May your head.
[1574.92 → 1575.98] Be lifted.
[1576.10 → 1577.32] To see the one who made it all.

[1610.04 → 1610.62] That you are.
[1610.82 → 1611.66] Our shade.
[1611.74 → 1612.98] When things get hot.
[1612.98 → 1613.74] That you are.
[1614.42 → 1615.62] In the valleys.
[1615.62 → 1616.68] And on the mountaintops.
[1616.78 → 1617.62] That you are a God.

[1621.30 → 1621.58] Knowing.
[1622.36 → 1623.12] You lead us on.
[1624.20 → 1624.42] Lord.
[1624.44 → 1625.26] We praise you for that.
[1625.34 → 1626.50] Be with all the people here.
[1626.74 → 1628.20] Whose heads need to be lifted.
[1628.28 → 1628.40] Lord.
[1628.44 → 1629.26] Will you take their heads.
[1629.36 → 1630.46] And pull them up.
[1630.70 → 1632.22] That they might see your loving face.
[1632.88 → 1634.20] And then do the same for others.
[1634.66 → 1636.12] We pray this in Jesus' holy name.
