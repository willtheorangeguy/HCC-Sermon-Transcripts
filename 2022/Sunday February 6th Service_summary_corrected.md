• Start of sermon series on John chapter 5
• Reading from John chapter 5, specific story about Jesus healing an invalid man near the pool of Bethesda
• A man was healed by Jesus on the Sabbath.
• The Jewish leaders criticized him for breaking the law, but he replied that Jesus told him to pick up his mat and walk.
• The man did not know who Jesus was.
• Later, Jesus found the man at the temple and warned him to stop sinning or worse would happen.
• The man told the Jewish leaders that Jesus healed him.
• This led to persecution of Jesus by the Jewish leaders.
• Jesus defended himself by saying he is always working, even on the Sabbath, because his Father is always working.

• Jesus' question to the paraplegic man, "Do you want to get well?", is used as a catalyst to explore the theme of hopelessness and whether one wants to be healed.
• The paraplegic man's initial response to Jesus' healing is not one of gratitude or faith, but rather he reports Jesus to the Jews.
• Jesus confronts the man again with both grace and truth after his physical healing.
• The miraculous signs performed by Jesus, including healings, point to the full restoration of God's kingdom and good creation.
