[0.00 --> 3.86]  Thank you, John, and thank you, Hope, our collective.
[4.28 --> 7.58]  And if you're interested in serving the church with art,
[8.36 --> 13.36]  you can always talk to John and join our community and serve in this way.
[13.86 --> 15.96]  I'm not an art person at all,
[16.16 --> 20.14]  but just hearing these interpretations and these drawings, expressions,
[20.94 --> 24.70]  it makes you really think about what we are hearing
[24.70 --> 27.82]  and what we are reflecting from the Psalms.
[27.82 --> 32.80]  And so this morning, as I've said, we're going into the Psalms.
[33.62 --> 36.70]  And as we begin looking at the Psalms
[36.70 --> 40.58]  and how they express the experiences of life,
[40.96 --> 46.16]  it is important and it is very crucial that we note how all these prayers,
[46.34 --> 50.90]  how all these honest prayers, they're directed to God.
[51.76 --> 56.80]  And I think that's the most crucial point that we should not let go of or forget,
[56.80 --> 63.30]  that whatever prayers you may bring, however you may feel about those prayers,
[63.74 --> 65.60]  we bring them before our God.
[66.56 --> 69.36]  And so I don't know what your prayer life looks like right now,
[69.70 --> 72.42]  whether communally or individually,
[73.00 --> 78.42]  but the Psalms and all 150 of them reflect what praying to God looks like.
[78.42 --> 80.38]  And so this is a quote.
[80.48 --> 81.76]  I don't know if it's going to be up there.
[82.06 --> 83.08]  My fault for being late.
[83.22 --> 85.10]  But this is a quote from Eugene Peterson,
[85.54 --> 88.20]  a well-known biblical scholar who said this about the Psalms.
[89.54 --> 90.14]  Thank you.
[90.74 --> 96.00]  Everything that a person can possibly feel, experience, and say
[96.00 --> 99.18]  is brought into expression before God in the Psalms.
[99.18 --> 103.28]  If you have thought or felt anything like I have,
[103.78 --> 108.06]  of not knowing exactly how to pray or what to pray about,
[109.06 --> 111.16]  this sermon series is just for you.
[112.20 --> 116.76]  The Psalms teach us how to pray and to pray honestly before our God.
[117.96 --> 120.36]  And so before we begin looking at the very first Psalm,
[120.88 --> 123.72]  I want to do a brief introduction to the Psalms in general.
[124.36 --> 127.56]  I'll keep it as brief as possible, like I did last week.
[127.56 --> 132.22]  And so the Psalms, what are the Psalms?
[132.62 --> 134.12]  Why is it called Psalms?
[134.48 --> 136.36]  I did a little bit of research.
[136.54 --> 138.52]  The Psalms come from the etymology,
[138.68 --> 141.58]  the root of the word Psalms, pussalms, right?
[141.68 --> 145.44]  So the P is silent, but it's pronounced Psalms.
[145.58 --> 151.74]  And it comes from the meaning that it is something that you sing along to the harp,
[151.92 --> 152.40]  I believe.
[152.64 --> 154.32]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[154.32 --> 160.68]  But it's songs or expressions, prayers, confessions that are to be either musically sung
[160.68 --> 162.68]  or poetically confessed.
[164.18 --> 170.02]  And so many scholars also say that the Psalms were used for corporate worship by the people
[170.02 --> 176.84]  of God to honestly express their experiences, thoughts, and feelings to God in the worship
[176.84 --> 177.26]  setting.
[177.26 --> 186.18]  And so what we learn about God in the Psalms are reflections of real-life responses to real-life
[186.18 --> 186.90]  situations.
[188.24 --> 193.64]  I pulled just one more quote, this one from a different scholar.
[194.12 --> 194.70]  And he says,
[194.70 --> 202.16]  The Psalms are diverse and yet remarkably coherent songs whose aim is to praise the God of Israel,
[202.44 --> 208.54]  to celebrate His love and power even in the midst of pain and sorrow, and indeed to bring
[208.54 --> 211.32]  all of human life into His presence.
[212.50 --> 215.58]  All of human life into His presence.
[215.58 --> 223.32]  The key is that our whole life, every last bit of it, is brought before our God in prayer.
[224.42 --> 231.82]  And when we do bring to God all of our lives, we may hopefully be able to ground ourselves in who He is,
[232.72 --> 237.02]  and what our Psalms and what our Bible tells us about who God is.
[237.02 --> 244.22]  The loving, gracious, patient, understanding, and always faithful God.
[245.78 --> 250.58]  And so with this short introduction in mind, I invite you now, if you have your Bibles with you,
[250.86 --> 255.74]  on your phones, or print Bible, please turn with me to the very first Psalm.
[255.74 --> 267.22]  We begin the Psalms with Psalm 1.
[268.96 --> 275.74]  Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked, or stand in the way that sinners take,
[275.96 --> 283.56]  or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on His law
[283.56 --> 288.50]  day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water.
[290.92 --> 292.06]  Sorry, I lost my place.
[292.36 --> 295.80]  Which yields its fruit in season, and whose leaf does not wither.
[296.34 --> 298.28]  Whatever they do, prospers.
[299.22 --> 300.36]  Not so the wicked.
[301.04 --> 303.64]  They are like chaff, that the wind blows away.
[304.82 --> 307.54]  Therefore, the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
[307.84 --> 309.76]  nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
[310.42 --> 312.86]  For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,
[312.86 --> 316.24]  but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
[317.16 --> 318.46]  This is the word of the Lord.
[321.74 --> 325.56]  This Psalm opens the way into the Psalms as a collected whole.
[326.40 --> 329.42]  In a way, it sets the stage for the people of God
[329.42 --> 332.76]  reading and professing the Psalms that we're doing today.
[333.64 --> 334.72]  And as an introduction,
[335.36 --> 338.30]  it places two distinct contrasts
[338.30 --> 339.92]  between the way of righteousness,
[340.64 --> 341.92]  which is a blessing,
[342.52 --> 343.06]  blessing,
[343.70 --> 344.68]  blessed is the one,
[344.84 --> 346.28]  and the way to destruction,
[346.68 --> 348.02]  which leads to death.
[349.18 --> 351.22]  As the Psalms teach us to pray
[351.22 --> 354.46]  and express all that we go through in our journey of faith,
[355.26 --> 356.98]  the first Psalm gives us
[356.98 --> 359.28]  a template for what praying to God
[359.28 --> 361.00]  and journeying with Him is like.
[361.00 --> 362.72]  And in contrast,
[363.16 --> 364.02]  it shows us,
[364.24 --> 365.30]  the first Psalm does,
[365.66 --> 367.38]  what life looks like without Him.
[369.14 --> 372.70]  And so Psalm 1 is often known as wisdom literature.
[373.96 --> 374.96]  It's a genre.
[375.22 --> 375.42]  It's,
[375.70 --> 376.76]  you could say it's a proverb.
[377.80 --> 380.20]  There are many proverbs from all cultures.
[380.20 --> 382.46]  And as an analogy for this morning,
[382.66 --> 383.42]  I pulled out two.
[383.56 --> 384.64]  I researched two.
[384.94 --> 386.40]  One from my own Korean culture
[386.40 --> 388.22]  and one from the Dutch culture.
[388.82 --> 389.86]  I know we don't have
[389.86 --> 392.36]  many people in our church
[392.36 --> 393.98]  that may understand the Dutch.
[394.80 --> 395.94]  And so if I get it wrong,
[396.12 --> 397.72]  I don't think I'll be judged too much.
[398.04 --> 398.82]  But the first one,
[398.90 --> 400.08]  the Korean one says,
[400.60 --> 402.66]  원숭이도 나무에서 떨어진다.
[403.24 --> 404.54]  It's a very simple saying
[404.54 --> 405.12]  that says,
[405.32 --> 406.22]  translated literally,
[406.64 --> 408.54]  even the monkey falls off the tree.
[408.54 --> 411.54]  The meaning is that
[411.54 --> 412.50]  it comforts,
[412.50 --> 413.60]  it's supposed to comfort you,
[413.88 --> 414.74]  reminding you that
[414.74 --> 416.34]  even experts make mistakes.
[417.06 --> 418.28]  And then the Dutch one.
[419.42 --> 420.16]  Here we go.
[422.40 --> 423.38]  It's written,
[423.88 --> 424.10]  okay.
[424.54 --> 425.00]  Anyway, so,
[425.16 --> 426.06]  better in half,
[426.18 --> 427.64]  I done in lehe dope.
[429.16 --> 430.56]  Did anyone understand that?
[431.26 --> 431.82]  No?
[432.62 --> 434.18]  Can anyone translate it for me?
[434.92 --> 435.10]  No?
[437.04 --> 438.16]  Literally translated,
[438.16 --> 439.64]  it's better half an egg
[439.64 --> 440.68]  than an empty shell.
[441.92 --> 443.56]  The meaning supposedly is,
[443.82 --> 444.78]  we must be grateful
[444.78 --> 445.62]  for what we get,
[446.00 --> 447.76]  even if it is less than we desire.
[448.44 --> 449.44]  Those are two proverbs
[449.44 --> 449.96]  I looked at.
[450.00 --> 450.52]  There are many.
[451.06 --> 451.32]  I mean,
[451.40 --> 451.98]  right now,
[452.12 --> 453.62]  with my newborn,
[454.32 --> 455.92]  I'm getting a whole bunch
[455.92 --> 457.02]  of advice and proverbs
[457.02 --> 458.44]  on how to raise
[458.44 --> 459.78]  a newborn baby properly.
[460.20 --> 462.12]  And they're very diverse
[462.12 --> 462.70]  and different.
[462.70 --> 464.26]  And a lot of them
[464.26 --> 464.84]  are conflicting.
[465.70 --> 466.08]  Or,
[466.46 --> 467.68]  personally for me,
[467.78 --> 468.70]  growing up with eczema,
[468.82 --> 470.70]  I've heard thousands,
[471.54 --> 472.66]  that's an exaggeration,
[473.06 --> 474.28]  hundreds of advice
[474.28 --> 475.40]  on how to treat
[475.40 --> 476.26]  and have remedies
[476.26 --> 477.86]  to take care of my skin better.
[478.56 --> 479.18]  And again,
[479.38 --> 480.52]  they're so diverse.
[480.86 --> 481.46]  And a lot of,
[481.54 --> 482.72]  a lot of those advice
[482.72 --> 483.42]  are conflicting.
[483.60 --> 484.40]  So I don't even know
[484.40 --> 485.82]  who to trust anymore.
[485.82 --> 489.22]  One doctor says this,
[489.72 --> 489.82]  like,
[490.26 --> 491.70]  doctors with authority say,
[492.08 --> 492.24]  oh,
[492.36 --> 493.34]  eczema has to do
[493.34 --> 493.98]  with what you eat.
[494.26 --> 495.24]  Another doctor says,
[495.42 --> 496.26]  it has nothing to do
[496.26 --> 496.88]  with what you eat,
[496.98 --> 498.12]  you just have to treat it better.
[498.42 --> 499.70]  Put more moisturizer on it.
[500.24 --> 500.56]  And so,
[501.08 --> 502.94]  there are so many proverbs
[502.94 --> 503.96]  and advice.
[504.32 --> 505.96]  And the point of any proverb
[505.96 --> 509.00]  is to provide any wisdom
[509.00 --> 510.76]  that will lead to a better,
[511.48 --> 512.30]  and to use the words
[512.30 --> 513.20]  of our psalm this morning,
[513.48 --> 514.68]  a more blessed
[514.68 --> 517.06]  or a more prosperous life.
[518.42 --> 519.42]  Being reminded
[519.42 --> 520.52]  that we are not perfect,
[520.68 --> 521.42]  that even monkeys
[521.42 --> 522.32]  fall off trees,
[522.62 --> 524.40]  and that having a grateful mind
[524.40 --> 525.68]  will allow us
[525.68 --> 527.66]  to live a more happier life,
[527.98 --> 530.26]  maybe a more blessed life.
[533.32 --> 535.36]  But if we end the sermon here,
[536.36 --> 537.60]  what is the difference
[537.60 --> 539.04]  between God's Word
[539.04 --> 541.06]  and any general proverb?
[541.06 --> 544.74]  The wisdom that Psalm 1
[544.74 --> 546.36]  provides us with today
[546.36 --> 547.64]  is directing us
[547.64 --> 550.00]  to true blessedness,
[550.48 --> 551.56]  true happiness.
[552.34 --> 554.16]  That is the very first word
[554.16 --> 554.96]  that starts off
[554.96 --> 556.16]  the whole of the Psalms.
[556.48 --> 557.82]  Even in the original Hebrew,
[558.66 --> 559.84]  it starts off with,
[560.38 --> 561.14]  blessed is the one.
[561.52 --> 562.72]  Ashrei ha'ish.
[565.28 --> 567.96]  True blessing comes from God,
[567.96 --> 570.00]  and actually is God,
[570.22 --> 571.20]  in the sense that living
[571.20 --> 572.68]  in communion with our God,
[573.18 --> 574.14]  living the life
[574.14 --> 574.98]  that was intended
[574.98 --> 576.14]  by our Creator,
[577.18 --> 578.46]  is true blessing,
[579.10 --> 580.16]  is true happiness.
[581.62 --> 582.96]  The gospel message
[582.96 --> 583.84]  for us this morning
[583.84 --> 586.74]  is that this is true life
[586.74 --> 587.88]  that we have
[587.88 --> 590.54]  only through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[590.90 --> 592.24]  And that is a very simple
[592.24 --> 593.72]  and direct gospel for us
[593.72 --> 595.24]  through the Psalms this morning,
[595.24 --> 597.14]  that true happiness
[597.14 --> 598.54]  and true blessedness
[598.54 --> 600.58]  is through the grace of our God,
[600.94 --> 602.16]  through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[603.04 --> 604.60]  And so as we get into the wisdom
[604.60 --> 606.86]  of how living this life
[606.86 --> 607.94]  of faith looks like,
[608.78 --> 610.06]  the psalmist starts off
[610.06 --> 610.68]  with a negative,
[611.20 --> 612.56]  with the things to avoid
[612.56 --> 614.08]  if one desires to live
[614.08 --> 615.56]  a truly blessed life.
[617.02 --> 618.34]  Blessed is the one
[618.34 --> 621.24]  who does not walk in step.
[622.02 --> 623.68]  Although a better translation
[623.68 --> 624.70]  for this one would be
[624.70 --> 627.20]  to walk in the counsel of,
[627.30 --> 629.06]  in the advice of sinners,
[629.46 --> 630.34]  of the wicked.
[630.94 --> 633.06]  Stand in ways that sinners take,
[633.30 --> 635.68]  or sit in the company of mockers.
[637.20 --> 638.68]  And so for my sermon this morning,
[638.82 --> 640.30]  I listened to Dave's old sermon
[640.30 --> 641.06]  on the Psalms.
[641.64 --> 642.94]  And a significant point
[642.94 --> 644.42]  that I think is very appropriate
[644.42 --> 645.88]  for our community today,
[646.62 --> 648.78]  especially with a lot of high schoolers
[648.78 --> 650.10]  graduating from high school
[650.10 --> 650.74]  this season,
[650.74 --> 653.26]  is that the trajectory
[653.26 --> 654.54]  that we can observe
[654.54 --> 656.40]  happening with the young adults.
[657.84 --> 659.96]  Especially after graduating high school,
[660.08 --> 662.94]  and I can relate this myself as well,
[663.00 --> 664.54]  and a lot of it.
[665.48 --> 666.72]  You find yourself,
[666.90 --> 667.70]  after high school,
[667.94 --> 668.92]  going to university,
[669.24 --> 670.44]  or joining the workforce,
[671.24 --> 673.46]  where you are not necessarily protected
[673.46 --> 675.66]  by faithful people in your community,
[676.36 --> 677.62]  by a youth group maybe,
[677.62 --> 679.22]  or even by family,
[679.32 --> 680.64]  depending on where you end up.
[682.12 --> 684.96]  Especially after graduating high school,
[685.22 --> 686.80]  you start associating yourself
[686.80 --> 689.24]  with those who do not recognize your faith,
[689.68 --> 691.40]  or actually downright reject
[691.40 --> 692.82]  your identity as a Christian.
[694.34 --> 696.10]  And the more you walk with them,
[696.26 --> 699.14]  or receive their counsel and advice,
[699.76 --> 701.40]  and the more you stand with them,
[701.72 --> 703.06]  and you identify with them,
[703.40 --> 705.88]  and then eventually you sit with them,
[705.88 --> 708.00]  they end up becoming
[708.00 --> 709.76]  your primary company.
[712.00 --> 712.52]  Then,
[712.80 --> 714.04]  when this happens,
[714.16 --> 715.12]  when they become,
[715.22 --> 716.28]  when sinners become,
[716.60 --> 718.22]  when non-Christians become
[718.22 --> 719.56]  your primary company,
[720.56 --> 722.00]  you come to the place
[722.00 --> 723.16]  where church does not
[723.16 --> 724.66]  end up happening anymore.
[725.84 --> 727.10]  Where you struggle
[727.10 --> 729.12]  to even have meaningful conversations
[729.12 --> 730.94]  about your faith with anyone.
[732.30 --> 733.96]  If you feel guilty enough
[733.96 --> 735.12]  because you grew up in the church,
[735.12 --> 736.66]  you may maybe listen
[736.66 --> 737.66]  to an online sermon
[737.66 --> 738.78]  or a Christian podcast
[738.78 --> 739.54]  here and there,
[739.98 --> 741.92]  but you end up shaping your life
[741.92 --> 743.58]  around the path away
[743.58 --> 744.46]  from God's word
[744.46 --> 746.98]  and away from his people,
[747.26 --> 747.98]  his community.
[750.52 --> 751.08]  Now,
[751.10 --> 752.38]  the point I'm trying to make
[752.38 --> 753.60]  is not to suggest
[753.60 --> 755.28]  that we stay away
[755.28 --> 755.94]  from the world
[755.94 --> 756.82]  and protect,
[757.02 --> 758.16]  protect ourselves
[758.16 --> 758.82]  in the safety
[758.82 --> 760.34]  of some sort of Christian bubble,
[760.90 --> 763.62]  as if there's a perfect Christian bubble
[763.62 --> 764.86]  that will protect us.
[766.16 --> 767.66]  That actually goes against
[767.66 --> 768.72]  the missional identity
[768.72 --> 770.16]  we have as God's people
[770.16 --> 771.80]  to be in the world,
[772.02 --> 772.86]  to be a witness
[772.86 --> 773.70]  for God's kingdom.
[774.96 --> 776.58]  Our calling is actually
[776.58 --> 778.02]  to be in the world.
[778.58 --> 778.92]  It's just,
[779.04 --> 779.78]  the point is,
[780.16 --> 781.02]  we're not supposed
[781.02 --> 781.78]  to be of it.
[782.78 --> 785.08]  We're not to walk,
[785.54 --> 786.82]  we're not to stand,
[787.20 --> 788.04]  we're not to sit
[788.04 --> 789.30]  with the world,
[789.66 --> 790.60]  but we are in it.
[790.60 --> 793.12]  The point I want to make
[793.12 --> 793.94]  that the psalmist
[793.94 --> 795.16]  expresses in Psalm 1
[795.16 --> 797.02]  is exactly what Paul says
[797.02 --> 797.60]  in Romans.
[798.28 --> 800.96]  And I read from Romans 12.2.
[801.82 --> 802.46]  He says,
[802.86 --> 803.74]  Do not conform
[803.74 --> 804.66]  to the pattern
[804.66 --> 805.48]  of this world,
[805.94 --> 806.94]  but be transformed.
[807.70 --> 808.50]  Be renewed
[808.50 --> 809.44]  by the transforming,
[809.74 --> 811.30]  be transformed
[811.30 --> 812.22]  by the renewing
[812.22 --> 812.78]  of your mind.
[813.38 --> 814.52]  Then you will be able
[814.52 --> 815.98]  to test and approve
[815.98 --> 817.68]  of what God's will is,
[817.92 --> 818.52]  His good,
[818.52 --> 819.22]  pleasing,
[819.50 --> 820.76]  and perfect will.
[821.54 --> 822.44]  His good,
[822.96 --> 823.36]  pleasing,
[823.60 --> 824.74]  and perfect will,
[825.06 --> 825.48]  meaning,
[825.98 --> 827.46]  a blessed life.
[828.92 --> 830.18]  Later on in the chapter,
[830.32 --> 831.22]  Paul also says,
[831.32 --> 832.52]  which is one of my favorite
[832.52 --> 833.44]  verses in the Bible.
[833.86 --> 835.74]  When I was in Korea teaching,
[835.90 --> 837.00]  I had this Bible verse
[837.00 --> 838.78]  written in my classroom
[838.78 --> 839.40]  every week,
[839.74 --> 840.34]  every year,
[840.40 --> 840.86]  I should say.
[841.92 --> 843.40]  Romans 12.21 says,
[843.78 --> 844.86]  Do not be overcome
[844.86 --> 845.68]  by evil,
[845.86 --> 847.16]  but overcome evil
[847.16 --> 848.06]  with good.
[848.06 --> 848.74]  Again,
[850.10 --> 851.10]  the point is not
[851.10 --> 852.98]  to be separated
[852.98 --> 853.66]  from the world.
[853.78 --> 854.52]  The point is
[854.52 --> 855.84]  to be in the world,
[855.98 --> 857.08]  but not of it.
[858.94 --> 859.60]  And so I want
[859.60 --> 860.40]  to challenge you
[860.40 --> 860.98]  this morning
[860.98 --> 861.98]  to ask yourself,
[863.16 --> 864.32]  do you find life
[864.32 --> 865.82]  in God's living word,
[866.46 --> 867.50]  which proclaims
[867.50 --> 868.08]  the gospel,
[868.44 --> 869.40]  the good news
[869.40 --> 870.08]  that our Lord
[870.08 --> 871.40]  and Savior Jesus Christ,
[871.96 --> 873.22]  how He died
[873.22 --> 874.12]  and was resurrected
[874.12 --> 874.76]  from the dead,
[875.04 --> 876.16]  defeated death
[876.16 --> 877.02]  for us
[877.02 --> 878.32]  so that we may
[878.32 --> 878.88]  have life?
[880.20 --> 880.76]  Or,
[881.76 --> 882.92]  do you still struggle
[882.92 --> 883.68]  to identify
[883.68 --> 886.22]  who your primary company is,
[887.36 --> 888.42]  thinking that sitting
[888.42 --> 889.16]  on the fence
[889.16 --> 890.30]  is still an option?
[890.30 --> 893.96]  our psalm this morning
[893.96 --> 894.80]  is asking you
[894.80 --> 895.80]  to choose life.
[897.14 --> 897.98]  Choose the life
[897.98 --> 898.64]  of blessing,
[899.12 --> 900.18]  the life in communion
[900.18 --> 900.88]  with God
[900.88 --> 901.52]  through the grace
[901.52 --> 901.96]  of Jesus
[901.96 --> 903.48]  that allows us
[903.48 --> 904.28]  the true freedom
[904.28 --> 905.72]  to live the life
[905.72 --> 907.12]  that was intended
[907.12 --> 907.82]  from the beginning.
[909.28 --> 910.66]  And that is the good news
[910.66 --> 911.44]  for us this morning,
[911.56 --> 911.72]  Hope.
[911.96 --> 913.42]  We have life
[913.42 --> 914.04]  in Christ.
[914.26 --> 915.70]  We proclaim life
[915.70 --> 916.76]  in His name.
[916.76 --> 919.02]  And so,
[919.14 --> 920.28]  blessed is the one
[920.28 --> 921.10]  who does not
[921.10 --> 922.22]  identify with sinners,
[922.52 --> 923.42]  whose trajectory
[923.42 --> 925.10]  is not away from God,
[925.36 --> 927.02]  but blessed is the one
[927.02 --> 928.32]  who delights
[928.32 --> 929.78]  in the law
[929.78 --> 930.58]  of the Lord,
[931.10 --> 931.86]  in the Torah
[931.86 --> 932.76]  of the Lord.
[934.04 --> 934.82]  The translation
[934.82 --> 935.54]  law
[935.54 --> 937.12]  makes it unnecessarily
[937.12 --> 938.90]  too legalistic sounding.
[940.06 --> 941.08]  A better translation
[941.08 --> 941.80]  might be
[941.80 --> 942.78]  instructions
[942.78 --> 943.52]  of the Lord
[943.52 --> 944.42]  or guidelines
[944.42 --> 945.28]  of the Lord
[945.28 --> 946.66]  for a truly
[946.66 --> 947.54]  blessed life.
[948.54 --> 949.40]  I want you
[949.40 --> 950.42]  to picture the image
[950.42 --> 951.56]  not as God
[951.56 --> 953.38]  waiting to disqualify you
[953.38 --> 954.60]  into destruction
[954.60 --> 955.82]  at every shortcoming
[955.82 --> 956.56]  that you have.
[957.46 --> 958.46]  That here's the standard,
[958.60 --> 959.70]  every time you fall short,
[959.88 --> 961.50]  oh, you're disqualified.
[963.14 --> 964.26]  But the image
[964.26 --> 965.20]  is more like
[965.20 --> 966.02]  God,
[966.28 --> 967.38]  a loving Father,
[969.16 --> 971.40]  trying desperately
[971.40 --> 972.48]  to get our attention
[972.48 --> 974.62]  so that we may hear
[974.62 --> 976.54]  see and experience
[976.54 --> 978.16]  the real blessing
[978.16 --> 979.18]  and real life
[979.18 --> 979.74]  in His name.
[981.60 --> 983.00]  And what better way
[983.00 --> 984.04]  to hear and see
[984.04 --> 984.70]  this life
[984.70 --> 985.78]  than through
[985.78 --> 987.38]  His revealed will,
[987.88 --> 988.88]  through His
[988.88 --> 990.38]  revealed will
[990.38 --> 991.30]  in our scriptures.
[996.30 --> 997.94]  Our psalm also says
[997.94 --> 998.62]  to meditate
[998.62 --> 1000.04]  on God's instructions
[1000.04 --> 1000.80]  for us,
[1001.00 --> 1002.00]  on God's Torah
[1002.00 --> 1002.72]  for us.
[1004.16 --> 1005.16]  The significance
[1005.16 --> 1006.14]  of this word,
[1006.36 --> 1006.66]  meditate,
[1007.66 --> 1009.92]  is to slow down.
[1012.06 --> 1013.04]  Unlike my sermon
[1013.04 --> 1013.68]  last week,
[1014.48 --> 1016.18]  to slow down
[1016.18 --> 1017.22]  means to really
[1017.22 --> 1017.80]  chew
[1017.80 --> 1019.06]  and really
[1019.06 --> 1019.90]  take root
[1019.90 --> 1021.02]  in what God
[1021.02 --> 1021.82]  is saying to you
[1021.82 --> 1022.86]  through His living word.
[1024.60 --> 1025.70]  And I really like
[1025.70 --> 1026.24]  the image
[1026.24 --> 1026.92]  that Dave used
[1026.92 --> 1027.46]  in his sermon.
[1027.46 --> 1027.56]  meditation.
[1028.46 --> 1029.50]  He says
[1029.50 --> 1031.28]  that he compares
[1031.28 --> 1032.48]  meditation
[1032.48 --> 1033.44]  to eating
[1033.44 --> 1034.02]  really,
[1034.16 --> 1034.76]  really delicious
[1034.76 --> 1035.30]  chocolate
[1035.30 --> 1037.10]  really fast
[1037.10 --> 1038.22]  as compared
[1038.22 --> 1038.92]  to eating it
[1038.92 --> 1039.46]  really,
[1039.66 --> 1040.18]  really slow,
[1040.72 --> 1041.46]  letting it melt
[1041.46 --> 1042.18]  on your tongue
[1042.18 --> 1042.84]  and just
[1042.84 --> 1043.64]  being able
[1043.64 --> 1044.74]  to really feel
[1044.74 --> 1045.26]  and experience
[1045.26 --> 1046.24]  that delicious chocolate.
[1050.06 --> 1051.34]  You can't truly
[1051.34 --> 1051.98]  appreciate
[1051.98 --> 1053.06]  that wonderful taste
[1053.06 --> 1053.80]  if you eat it
[1053.80 --> 1054.38]  too fast.
[1054.38 --> 1055.16]  And that goes
[1055.16 --> 1056.46]  with any delicious food.
[1057.46 --> 1062.32]  in our culture
[1062.32 --> 1062.74]  today,
[1062.84 --> 1063.68]  which is drenched
[1063.68 --> 1064.48]  in so much
[1064.48 --> 1065.80]  instant gratification
[1065.80 --> 1067.16]  that we even
[1067.16 --> 1067.74]  have to fight
[1067.74 --> 1068.70]  our own instincts
[1068.70 --> 1070.02]  to slow down
[1070.02 --> 1070.90]  to really enjoy
[1070.90 --> 1071.34]  anything.
[1072.34 --> 1072.94]  Hear this
[1072.94 --> 1073.44]  encouragement
[1073.44 --> 1074.30]  from our psalm
[1074.30 --> 1074.76]  this morning.
[1075.74 --> 1077.08]  It is telling us
[1077.08 --> 1077.80]  in our modern
[1077.80 --> 1079.28]  fast-paced culture
[1079.28 --> 1080.62]  to slow down
[1080.62 --> 1082.40]  and really enjoy,
[1083.28 --> 1084.12]  be immersed,
[1084.60 --> 1085.06]  be rooted
[1085.06 --> 1085.98]  in God's word.
[1085.98 --> 1089.20]  The person
[1089.20 --> 1089.86]  that is able
[1089.86 --> 1090.62]  to really dig
[1090.62 --> 1091.04]  deep
[1091.04 --> 1091.98]  and become
[1091.98 --> 1093.16]  rooted in God's word
[1093.16 --> 1094.30]  is like a tree
[1094.30 --> 1095.38]  planted in streams
[1095.38 --> 1095.88]  of water,
[1096.84 --> 1097.64]  yielding fruit
[1097.64 --> 1098.34]  in its season
[1098.34 --> 1098.96]  whose leaf
[1098.96 --> 1099.76]  does not wither,
[1100.08 --> 1101.14]  who prospers
[1101.14 --> 1101.94]  in whatever
[1101.94 --> 1102.48]  they do.
[1104.48 --> 1105.00]  Prosper.
[1106.72 --> 1107.28]  Again,
[1107.38 --> 1108.10]  this points us
[1108.10 --> 1108.92]  back to the first
[1108.92 --> 1109.78]  word that the psalm
[1109.78 --> 1110.42]  started with,
[1111.14 --> 1111.58]  blessed.
[1111.58 --> 1113.84]  living a life
[1113.84 --> 1114.56]  as intended
[1114.56 --> 1115.64]  by our perfect
[1115.64 --> 1116.14]  creator,
[1116.66 --> 1117.52]  enjoying and
[1117.52 --> 1118.12]  celebrating
[1118.12 --> 1119.34]  a prosperous,
[1119.98 --> 1120.94]  a blessed life
[1120.94 --> 1121.52]  in communion
[1121.52 --> 1122.28]  with our loving
[1122.28 --> 1122.62]  Father.
[1124.50 --> 1125.08]  Now,
[1125.14 --> 1125.70]  if I had more
[1125.70 --> 1126.18]  time,
[1126.26 --> 1126.84]  I would warn
[1126.84 --> 1128.52]  against equating
[1128.52 --> 1129.36]  this definition
[1129.36 --> 1130.18]  of blessing
[1130.18 --> 1131.86]  and prosperous
[1131.86 --> 1132.36]  and being
[1132.36 --> 1132.86]  prosperous
[1132.86 --> 1134.80]  with material
[1134.80 --> 1135.28]  wealth.
[1135.28 --> 1136.98]  but I'm sure
[1136.98 --> 1137.62]  nobody here
[1137.62 --> 1137.94]  at Hope
[1137.94 --> 1138.50]  has a problem
[1138.50 --> 1138.96]  with that.
[1143.20 --> 1144.20]  The opposite
[1144.20 --> 1144.82]  end of this
[1144.82 --> 1145.20]  spectrum
[1145.20 --> 1146.08]  is one
[1146.08 --> 1146.66]  who is like
[1146.66 --> 1147.56]  chaff
[1147.56 --> 1148.34]  that is
[1148.34 --> 1149.18]  blown away.
[1150.18 --> 1150.98]  They are not
[1150.98 --> 1151.98]  rooted in anything.
[1153.06 --> 1154.04]  They are constantly
[1154.04 --> 1154.84]  on the move,
[1155.50 --> 1156.28]  being influenced
[1156.28 --> 1157.22]  by this and that,
[1157.56 --> 1158.16]  not knowing
[1158.16 --> 1159.12]  exactly who
[1159.12 --> 1159.88]  their primary
[1159.88 --> 1160.74]  company is.
[1160.74 --> 1163.30]  our psalm
[1163.30 --> 1163.86]  says that
[1163.86 --> 1164.34]  their life
[1164.34 --> 1165.02]  shall perish,
[1165.54 --> 1166.40]  meaning that
[1166.40 --> 1166.90]  their life
[1166.90 --> 1168.18]  will reflect
[1168.18 --> 1168.70]  a life
[1168.70 --> 1169.06]  that is
[1169.06 --> 1169.64]  aimless,
[1170.32 --> 1171.10]  directionless,
[1171.40 --> 1172.92]  because it is
[1172.92 --> 1173.80]  a life away
[1173.80 --> 1174.54]  from God,
[1175.04 --> 1175.88]  away from
[1175.88 --> 1176.36]  the true
[1176.36 --> 1177.04]  source of
[1177.04 --> 1177.72]  eternal life.
[1179.96 --> 1180.38]  And so,
[1180.52 --> 1180.94]  for us,
[1181.04 --> 1181.68]  the good news
[1181.68 --> 1182.02]  is,
[1183.06 --> 1183.48]  in our
[1183.48 --> 1184.14]  Christian,
[1184.40 --> 1185.24]  Christ-centered
[1185.24 --> 1185.74]  faith,
[1187.20 --> 1187.86]  Christ is
[1187.86 --> 1188.40]  the provider
[1188.40 --> 1188.94]  of life.
[1188.94 --> 1190.62]  Christ is
[1190.62 --> 1191.14]  the provider
[1191.14 --> 1191.90]  of our
[1191.90 --> 1192.36]  lives.
[1193.60 --> 1193.92]  We look
[1193.92 --> 1194.32]  to Him
[1194.32 --> 1194.88]  for life,
[1195.20 --> 1195.68]  and whoever
[1195.68 --> 1196.70]  believes in Him
[1196.70 --> 1197.38]  shall not
[1197.38 --> 1198.20]  perish,
[1198.80 --> 1199.58]  but have
[1199.58 --> 1200.26]  eternal life.
[1201.94 --> 1202.66]  They shall
[1202.66 --> 1203.72]  have a truly
[1203.72 --> 1204.56]  blessed life.
[1206.54 --> 1206.92]  And so,
[1207.02 --> 1207.62]  as we journey
[1207.62 --> 1208.06]  through the
[1208.06 --> 1208.56]  Psalms this
[1208.56 --> 1208.82]  summer,
[1209.34 --> 1210.00]  I want to
[1210.00 --> 1210.58]  encourage you
[1210.58 --> 1211.40]  to find life
[1211.40 --> 1211.88]  in God's
[1211.88 --> 1212.14]  Word.
[1213.32 --> 1213.82]  Meditate,
[1214.48 --> 1215.60]  slowly immerse
[1215.60 --> 1216.40]  yourself in
[1216.40 --> 1217.20]  His life-giving
[1217.20 --> 1218.06]  Word that
[1218.06 --> 1218.80]  proclaims
[1218.80 --> 1219.36]  life in
[1219.36 --> 1219.94]  Christ's
[1219.94 --> 1220.20]  name.
[1221.72 --> 1222.48]  And as
[1222.48 --> 1222.88]  you root
[1222.88 --> 1223.58]  yourself in
[1223.58 --> 1223.88]  God's
[1223.88 --> 1224.44]  living Word,
[1225.10 --> 1225.64]  may you
[1225.64 --> 1226.44]  be able to
[1226.44 --> 1227.56]  celebrate and
[1227.56 --> 1228.98]  enjoy the
[1228.98 --> 1230.32]  truly prosperous,
[1230.88 --> 1231.58]  blessed life
[1231.58 --> 1233.00]  through all of
[1233.00 --> 1234.02]  our joys and
[1234.02 --> 1234.52]  sorrows.
[1236.52 --> 1237.56]  And all of
[1237.56 --> 1238.28]  our joys and
[1238.28 --> 1239.86]  sorrows that
[1239.86 --> 1240.58]  we learned last
[1240.58 --> 1241.40]  week, we go
[1241.40 --> 1242.20]  through together.
[1242.76 --> 1243.50]  This is your
[1243.50 --> 1244.48]  primary company.
[1245.38 --> 1246.08]  The people of
[1246.08 --> 1246.66]  God journey
[1246.66 --> 1247.48]  together through
[1247.48 --> 1248.28]  all of our
[1248.28 --> 1248.72]  emotions,
[1249.04 --> 1249.54]  through all
[1249.54 --> 1249.88]  of our
[1249.88 --> 1250.22]  journeys,
[1250.54 --> 1251.00]  whether you
[1251.00 --> 1251.74]  are very
[1251.74 --> 1252.20]  joyful,
[1252.70 --> 1253.30]  very happy
[1253.30 --> 1253.84]  this morning,
[1253.90 --> 1254.36]  or whether
[1254.36 --> 1254.94]  you're down,
[1256.12 --> 1256.76]  something is
[1256.76 --> 1257.26]  tugging at
[1257.26 --> 1257.70]  your heart.
[1257.70 --> 1280.52]  we journey
[1280.52 --> 1281.02]  together.
[1281.02 --> 1281.08]  joy.
[1286.08 --> 1286.62]  These are
[1286.62 --> 1289.28]  tears of joy and
[1289.28 --> 1290.10]  tears of sadness
[1290.10 --> 1290.64]  at the same
[1290.64 --> 1291.00]  time.
[1293.00 --> 1294.52]  Just so that I'm
[1294.52 --> 1295.06]  clear, there's
[1295.06 --> 1297.56]  nothing big that's
[1297.56 --> 1298.24]  happening in my
[1298.24 --> 1298.92]  family or something,
[1299.04 --> 1300.18]  like nobody's dying
[1300.18 --> 1300.86]  at the moment.
[1302.04 --> 1303.12]  I am truly
[1303.12 --> 1303.66]  grateful.
[1303.80 --> 1304.44]  These are tears of
[1304.44 --> 1305.52]  joy, real joy,
[1306.16 --> 1307.44]  how our family has
[1307.44 --> 1308.82]  been blessed by so
[1308.82 --> 1309.28]  many in our
[1309.28 --> 1309.64]  community.
[1309.78 --> 1310.14]  And by the
[1310.14 --> 1311.76]  way, Hope, there
[1311.76 --> 1313.40]  are so many, so
[1313.40 --> 1314.04]  many talented
[1314.04 --> 1314.44]  cooks.
[1316.14 --> 1316.98]  And we've
[1316.98 --> 1318.10]  enjoyed so much
[1318.10 --> 1319.16]  delicious food and
[1319.16 --> 1320.36]  been blessed and
[1320.36 --> 1321.22]  have been able to
[1321.22 --> 1323.32]  enjoy that blessing
[1323.32 --> 1324.48]  together in our
[1324.48 --> 1326.14]  primary company, in
[1326.14 --> 1326.76]  our primary
[1326.76 --> 1327.38]  community.
[1329.28 --> 1330.24]  And at the same
[1330.24 --> 1331.28]  time, when we
[1331.28 --> 1332.14]  suffer, we get to
[1332.14 --> 1332.72]  suffer together.
[1333.68 --> 1335.04]  This is not the
[1335.04 --> 1335.62]  time for me.
[1335.78 --> 1336.62]  I've been off-center
[1336.62 --> 1337.52]  the whole sermon.
[1343.76 --> 1344.80]  But you have no
[1344.80 --> 1345.72]  idea how thankful
[1345.72 --> 1348.32]  I am that I am
[1348.32 --> 1349.42]  here with you,
[1349.96 --> 1350.80]  with Hope, here.
[1354.48 --> 1355.50]  And as we journey
[1355.50 --> 1356.40]  through the Psalms,
[1356.64 --> 1357.72]  I pray that you
[1357.72 --> 1358.64]  will be able to
[1358.64 --> 1360.00]  reflect some of the
[1360.00 --> 1362.02]  joys and also the
[1362.02 --> 1363.14]  sadness and suffering
[1363.14 --> 1364.60]  and grief that we
[1364.60 --> 1365.44]  will go through.
[1365.44 --> 1366.98]  And I pray that we
[1366.98 --> 1367.76]  will be able to do
[1367.76 --> 1368.58]  it together and we
[1368.58 --> 1370.30]  will be a true
[1370.30 --> 1371.42]  reflection of true
[1371.42 --> 1372.80]  blessing for one
[1372.80 --> 1373.08]  another.
[1374.06 --> 1375.04]  That is my prayer
[1375.04 --> 1375.76]  for you this morning.
[1375.86 --> 1376.94]  So please join me
[1376.94 --> 1377.76]  in prayer.
[1385.70 --> 1386.54]  Father God, we
[1386.54 --> 1388.86]  come before you in
[1388.86 --> 1390.78]  our raw, honest
[1390.78 --> 1391.40]  emotions.
[1391.40 --> 1395.58]  all that we have, all
[1395.58 --> 1397.46]  that we are, all that
[1397.46 --> 1398.32]  we go through, all
[1398.32 --> 1399.82]  that we experience,
[1400.18 --> 1401.76]  Lord, we bring it
[1401.76 --> 1402.30]  before you.
[1403.56 --> 1405.52]  We come to you and
[1405.52 --> 1407.10]  we look to you, Lord
[1407.10 --> 1407.46]  God.
[1409.68 --> 1411.28]  Lord, forgive us for
[1411.28 --> 1412.52]  trying to look for
[1412.52 --> 1416.40]  other ways and other
[1416.40 --> 1421.58]  things that are not
[1421.58 --> 1421.86]  you.
[1423.72 --> 1425.12]  Lord, I pray as we
[1425.12 --> 1425.78]  journey through the
[1425.78 --> 1426.52]  Psalms this summer
[1426.52 --> 1428.50]  that it will truly be
[1428.50 --> 1429.64]  a blessing for us,
[1430.18 --> 1431.24]  that we would be able
[1431.24 --> 1432.90]  to reflect what a
[1432.90 --> 1436.62]  life of blessedness,
[1436.76 --> 1438.00]  a life of righteousness
[1438.00 --> 1439.46]  looks like when we
[1439.46 --> 1441.12]  meditate, when we
[1441.12 --> 1443.10]  delight in your living
[1443.10 --> 1443.42]  word.
[1443.42 --> 1445.80]  Lord, let us be
[1445.80 --> 1448.70]  challenged that when
[1448.70 --> 1450.62]  we don't take your
[1450.62 --> 1452.04]  word and when we
[1452.04 --> 1453.32]  don't look to your
[1453.32 --> 1457.42]  word for life, we
[1457.42 --> 1458.50]  will find only death
[1458.50 --> 1459.92]  and destruction,
[1460.16 --> 1460.26]  Lord.
[1461.24 --> 1462.46]  So I pray that you
[1462.46 --> 1463.56]  will continue to guide
[1463.56 --> 1465.00]  your people, that by
[1465.00 --> 1466.22]  your grace and by your
[1466.22 --> 1467.96]  love, by your Holy
[1467.96 --> 1469.14]  Spirit, you will empower
[1469.14 --> 1470.70]  us and give us the
[1470.70 --> 1471.88]  wisdom, true
[1471.88 --> 1473.86]  proverbs, true wisdom
[1473.86 --> 1474.86]  through your Psalms,
[1474.94 --> 1476.32]  through your word, to
[1476.32 --> 1477.56]  be able to live for
[1477.56 --> 1478.88]  you, live for your
[1478.88 --> 1480.00]  kingdom here on earth
[1480.00 --> 1482.18]  as new creation, as
[1482.18 --> 1487.04]  new people living in
[1487.04 --> 1487.92]  communion with you.
[1488.36 --> 1489.34]  So we thank you for
[1489.34 --> 1490.12]  this morning, Lord.
[1490.88 --> 1492.48]  We thank you for the
[1492.48 --> 1493.08]  journey that we are
[1493.08 --> 1494.36]  starting with, with the
[1494.36 --> 1494.78]  Psalms.
[1495.64 --> 1496.80]  Lord, hear our praise,
[1497.18 --> 1498.06]  hear our honest
[1498.06 --> 1498.42]  prayers.
[1498.90 --> 1499.76]  We give you all the
[1499.76 --> 1500.66]  glory, Lord, and in
[1500.66 --> 1501.48]  Jesus' name we pray.
[1502.48 --> 1502.78]  Amen.
[1505.40 --> 1506.88]  I invite you to rise as
[1506.88 --> 1507.92]  we sing our song of
[1507.92 --> 1508.42]  response.
[1508.42 --> 1520.46]  through every battle, through
[1520.46 --> 1528.38]  every heartbreak, through
[1528.38 --> 1529.88]  every circumstance, through
[1529.88 --> 1533.88]  every battle, through every
[1533.88 --> 1534.88]  heartbreak, through every
[1534.88 --> 1536.88]  heartbreak, through every
[1536.88 --> 1538.88]  circumstance.
[1538.88 --> 1543.76]  I believe that you are my
[1543.76 --> 1549.54]  fortress, you are my portion, you
[1549.54 --> 1552.98]  are my hiding place.
[1552.98 --> 1562.98]  I believe you are the way, the truth, the
[1562.98 --> 1564.98]  life.
[1564.98 --> 1566.02]  I believe you are the way, the truth, the
[1566.02 --> 1567.02]  life.
[1567.02 --> 1577.02]  I believe you are the way, the truth, the
[1577.02 --> 1579.02]  life.
[1579.02 --> 1583.06]  I believe through every balance, through
[1583.06 --> 1585.06]  every promise, through every breath I take.
[1585.06 --> 1592.06]  through every promise, through every breath I take.
[1592.06 --> 1595.06]  I believe that you are my provider, you are my
[1595.06 --> 1602.06]  provider, you are my provider, you are my protector, you are the one I love.
[1602.06 --> 1609.06]  I believe you are the way, the truth, the life.
[1609.06 --> 1619.06]  I believe you are the way, the truth, the life.
[1619.06 --> 1632.06]  I believe you are the way, the truth, the life.
[1632.06 --> 1637.82]  I believe in His love.
[1648.82 --> 1654.86]  There's a new horizon and I'm set on you.
[1655.20 --> 1661.24]  And you meet me here today with verses that are new.
[1662.06 --> 1667.98]  All my fears and doubts, they can all come to you.
[1667.98 --> 1673.38]  Because they can't stay long when I'm here.
[1674.82 --> 1680.62]  It's a new horizon and I'm set on you.
[1681.86 --> 1687.26]  And you meet me here today with verses that are new.
[1687.26 --> 1693.18]  All my fears and doubts, they can all come to you.
[1693.18 --> 1699.98]  Because they can't stay long when I believe in Him.
[1699.98 --> 1713.22]  All the way, the truth, the life, I believe in Him.
[1713.22 --> 1726.78]  All the way, the truth, the life, I believe in Him.
[1726.78 --> 1751.94]  And so receive His blessing this morning, hope.
[1751.94 --> 1754.82]  as we journey through the Psalms
[1754.82 --> 1756.10]  and as we come to God,
[1757.46 --> 1759.44]  as we come before God in honest prayer,
[1760.14 --> 1761.22]  may He guide you.
[1763.80 --> 1766.76]  May you be filled with the fruit of righteousness
[1766.76 --> 1769.10]  that comes through Jesus Christ
[1769.10 --> 1773.26]  and only for the glory and praise of our God
[1773.26 --> 1774.94]  and all God's people said,
[1774.94 --> 1776.20]  Amen.
