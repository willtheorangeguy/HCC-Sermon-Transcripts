[0.00 --> 12.18]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[12.96 --> 15.24]  We're going to continue our series in the book of James.
[15.74 --> 20.50]  And I hope by now we're sort of picking up the way in which this book is challenging.
[21.14 --> 23.94]  And the thing that James is after is living faith.
[24.40 --> 29.16]  Not dead faith, not words without deeds, but people who, if they say they believe in Jesus Christ,
[29.16 --> 34.42]  is going to show up in their ordinary lives, in the way they act, the way they treat those who are vulnerable,
[34.86 --> 39.38]  not showing favoritism to the rich, and controlling the way they speak.
[40.48 --> 44.50]  Today's passage, actually just some feedback from the 9 a.m. service, is quite challenging.
[45.06 --> 47.90]  You know, sometimes people tell me right after the service, like, whoa, Dave, that was a challenging one.
[47.94 --> 49.26]  I'm like, it's not me, it's James.
[50.16 --> 54.76]  And so just so you know, it's an extension of last week's sermon on taming the tongue that Sid preached on.
[54.76 --> 57.28]  And if you have your Bible, turn with me to James chapter 4.
[57.64 --> 59.42]  We'll read verses 1 to 10 together.
[65.96 --> 66.74]  James 4.
[66.74 --> 93.86]  You adulterous people.
[93.86 --> 122.02]  Submit yourselves then to God.
[122.02 --> 151.10]  Well, this week I had the opportunity, along with Andre and Rhonda,
[151.10 --> 155.44]  that's the chair of our elders and the chair of our deacons, to go to this thing called classes.
[155.86 --> 158.82]  And if you're not, or if you haven't been around our denomination for a while,
[159.20 --> 162.26]  classes is the gathering of regional church leaders in our denomination.
[162.48 --> 163.82]  So it's pastors, elders, and deacons.
[164.22 --> 167.08]  And we gathered not just with the regional leaders in this area,
[167.12 --> 172.30]  but also in what's called BC Northwest, which is the other side of the bridge, Vancouver and wider.
[172.38 --> 173.58]  And we talked about church.
[173.58 --> 178.50]  And for me, it was a delight because I got to catch up with a lot of my colleagues that I hadn't seen since before COVID
[178.50 --> 182.12]  and talk about ministry and talk about how our churches are doing,
[182.12 --> 184.84]  how we navigate the pandemic, how everything's going.
[184.84 --> 190.68]  And we swapped a lot of stories about who screwed up their live streams the most,
[190.98 --> 192.20]  who made the most mistakes.
[192.28 --> 196.92]  And by the way, I think there's a great blooper video to be made on all the missteps that churches made
[196.92 --> 200.48]  as we went online and didn't know how to do audio and video and all the rest.
[200.54 --> 202.62]  There's a great video to be made of all the church mistakes.
[203.30 --> 204.22]  One notable one.
[204.30 --> 205.42]  I don't know if any of you remember this.
[205.56 --> 206.68]  You wouldn't because I never made it.
[207.04 --> 209.28]  But I tried to do communion once, leading everyone online.
[209.82 --> 213.40]  And I had, not knowingly, a broken, sorry, a frozen loaf of bread.
[214.38 --> 215.38]  Frozen, not just that.
[215.42 --> 216.32]  It was also stale.
[216.96 --> 220.22]  And so when I was like, the body of Christ given for you, I couldn't break the bread.
[220.38 --> 221.18]  And that was humiliating.
[221.36 --> 224.50]  And then once I did break the bread, a poof of white smoke came out of it.
[225.16 --> 228.06]  And then Dave Kimber and Joel Herod, who were doing the video, just said,
[228.14 --> 228.70]  shut it down.
[228.76 --> 229.62]  Let's start this over.
[230.12 --> 232.52]  Anyway, that is somewhere on Dave Kimber's computer.
[232.52 --> 238.80]  After we had this meeting, a number of us pastors went out for a drink at a local pub
[238.80 --> 239.58]  and we just talked.
[239.98 --> 243.90]  And we shared stories, some of the harder stories, of how our churches navigated over COVID.
[244.02 --> 246.92]  And one pastor visiting from a different province told this story.
[247.32 --> 248.48]  And maybe the story is too soon.
[248.56 --> 251.30]  It's about masks and COVID, but I hope you get the heart of it, okay?
[252.20 --> 255.72]  This is a story about the first Sunday that churches implemented masks in church.
[256.58 --> 260.74]  And in this church, the leaders got together after the government mandated masks and public gatherings.
[260.74 --> 262.40]  And they said, hey, we're going to do masks in our church.
[262.40 --> 263.88]  We're going to keep each other safe in this way.
[264.34 --> 265.38]  And Sunday morning came.
[265.54 --> 266.36]  People came into worship.
[266.54 --> 270.78]  And there's one fellow, loved in the church, long-term member of the church, was not wearing a mask.
[270.82 --> 271.66]  And he comes in the front.
[271.76 --> 273.90]  The greeter says, hey, you probably got the email from the leaders.
[274.14 --> 275.66]  We're going to do masks and worship today.
[276.38 --> 277.58]  He said, I'm not wearing a mask.
[278.24 --> 281.06]  And then he kind of walked past and he talked to a number of people in the foyer
[281.06 --> 283.30]  and expressed his displeasure with masks.
[283.78 --> 285.34]  And eventually he actually walked out.
[285.44 --> 286.34]  And he went back to his vehicle.
[286.40 --> 289.26]  He's going to go home because he was not happy about that requirement.
[289.26 --> 294.62]  And as he was walking to his car, a leader in the church, also a friend of his, saw him.
[294.66 --> 295.58]  And he says, hey, where are you going?
[295.70 --> 296.50]  Church is over there.
[296.96 --> 298.36]  He says, no, I'm not going to worship.
[298.50 --> 299.46]  I don't want to wear a mask.
[300.14 --> 306.48]  And this friend, as a true friend said, he said, look, you knew the decision the leaders of the church made.
[307.04 --> 309.84]  You knew coming here how that was going to come about.
[309.92 --> 311.86]  He says, now I have to ask you a hard question.
[311.86 --> 316.34]  Did you come here to pick a fight or did you come here to worship?
[318.30 --> 319.62]  And how do you think the story ends?
[320.78 --> 321.60]  I'm not going to tell you.
[321.64 --> 322.10]  It's a cliffhanger.
[323.54 --> 325.58]  I'm just, he's still in the parking lot to this day.
[326.20 --> 330.42]  No, he went inside the church and he worshiped.
[331.74 --> 337.36]  Now, James sometimes reminds me of that friend in the parking lot who said it straight.
[338.30 --> 340.64]  He said what needed to be said, even though it wasn't easy.
[340.72 --> 341.86]  He had the hard conversation.
[342.06 --> 345.00]  James does that over and over and over in this book.
[345.42 --> 348.12]  He confronts the church that he sees as having a dead faith.
[348.74 --> 352.50]  He confronts the church for showing favoritism to the rich and not caring about the vulnerable.
[352.92 --> 357.76]  He talks about how the words that people are using are destroying the hearts and lives of other people.
[357.76 --> 364.66]  And today, in this passage, it's almost as though he's coming to the church and he's saying, did you come here to pick a fight?
[365.42 --> 369.06]  And he wants to talk about quarrels and fights and what's behind them in the church.
[369.96 --> 372.30]  Of course, that's totally not relevant in today's society.
[372.44 --> 373.68]  We're not fighting in the church at all.
[373.86 --> 378.12]  So, we're just going to listen in on what James says to the church in his time.
[378.98 --> 382.66]  There are three pieces of wisdom that he gives that are all connected in this passage.
[382.98 --> 384.14]  And they are as follows.
[384.14 --> 389.14]  Number one, he talks about the source of the quarrels and fights, which is selfishness.
[389.82 --> 390.74]  That's verse one to three.
[390.74 --> 397.34]  And then he says to the church, in no uncertain terms, you and your selfishness are cheating on God.
[397.48 --> 398.44]  You're committing adultery.
[398.70 --> 402.42]  And your friendship with the world puts you at odds with your living Father.
[403.50 --> 404.92]  And then thirdly, he makes an invitation.
[405.90 --> 411.02]  An invitation to humility, where he says to the church, draw near to me, God, and I'll draw near to you.
[411.06 --> 412.00]  That's verse seven to ten.
[412.52 --> 414.12]  And we're going to look at all three of those this morning.
[414.12 --> 419.70]  But he starts with the question that's worth asking in every generation, in every city, in every church.
[420.22 --> 425.46]  What is the source of quarrels and fights among you?
[426.48 --> 431.52]  And you have to remember, this letter would have been read out loud to a group of believers, probably meeting in a house church.
[432.00 --> 436.94]  And I'm guessing as the believers heard James say these words to them, they would have different takes on it.
[437.02 --> 438.78]  Maybe someone would say, hey, it's that guy over there.
[438.82 --> 439.78]  He's the source of the problem.
[439.78 --> 441.86]  Or someone would say, it's this issue here.
[441.94 --> 445.66]  Or it's that ill-tempered woman over there that's causing the problems.
[446.08 --> 448.34]  But James actually answers his own question, if you're curious.
[448.98 --> 456.00]  And he says, do your quarrels and fights not come from your desires that battle within you?
[457.36 --> 460.36]  Now, there's an interesting diagnosis of the human condition.
[460.48 --> 462.50]  Do they not come from the desires that battle within you?
[462.66 --> 467.86]  And what he's naming, don't miss this, is that people are a mixed bag of desires, right?
[467.86 --> 473.88]  We in the church have a desire to care for our brothers and sisters and love them.
[473.94 --> 477.84]  But we also have a desire, an unhealthy desire, to elevate ourselves above some of them.
[478.82 --> 479.28]  That's true.
[479.76 --> 484.06]  We as believers in the church have a desire to speak the truth and uphold the truth in the church.
[484.12 --> 489.06]  But we also, alongside that, often have a desire to attack those who disagree with us.
[489.72 --> 492.72]  We in the church have a desire to serve the body with our gifts.
[492.72 --> 496.78]  But we also sometimes have a selfish desire to just be served.
[497.86 --> 502.96]  And James is saying the church is a mixed bag of believers with a mixed bag of desires.
[503.90 --> 505.30]  And here's the important thing.
[505.96 --> 508.32]  He never names what the source of the conflict is.
[508.36 --> 511.08]  We don't even know what specific things that they are arguing over is.
[511.30 --> 515.22]  What he does is get below that layer and say, I know what's going on.
[515.26 --> 518.58]  And at the heart of it is selfishness.
[518.58 --> 522.02]  Let me read for you what he says in verse 2 and following.
[522.12 --> 523.02]  I don't want us to miss it.
[523.86 --> 527.22]  It says, you desire, but you do not have, so you kill.
[527.30 --> 530.94]  And by the way, when he says kill, it's attack with your words, what Pastor Sid was looking at last week.
[531.52 --> 536.80]  You covet, but you cannot get what you want, and so you quarrel and fight.
[537.56 --> 538.38]  That's the assessment.
[539.14 --> 541.62]  James is saying, I know you're fighting, and I know you're fired up.
[541.62 --> 543.98]  He's like, but when I look at what's going on, you know what I see?
[544.18 --> 545.88]  I see believers who want something.
[546.08 --> 548.18]  They don't get it, and so they fight.
[550.32 --> 551.62]  That's a pretty interesting diagnosis.
[551.84 --> 557.38]  And even deeper than that, he says to them, you guys are so far gone here that you're abusing prayer.
[558.26 --> 561.18]  They're asking God for things selfishly and hoping that God will just give them.
[561.24 --> 564.62]  He says, you're not going to get what you want because you're asking with the wrong motives.
[564.62 --> 569.66]  Even your prayers are plagued by your selfishness.
[570.76 --> 575.92]  And in no uncertain terms, James says to them, the way you're operating, the way you're speaking,
[576.30 --> 580.28]  the fights you're having are killing your faith community.
[582.14 --> 585.10]  William Barclay, in his commentary on the book of James, puts it this way.
[585.86 --> 588.68]  And he's talking about selfish pleasures, and he says, and I quote,
[588.68 --> 592.22]  If pleasure is the policy of life, personal me getting what I want,
[592.72 --> 597.40]  nothing but strife and hatred and division can possibly follow.
[598.84 --> 599.94]  I'll come back to that.
[600.86 --> 605.52]  But now James actually takes a shift, and if you can believe it, he gets even more challenging.
[605.66 --> 606.36]  So buckle up.
[606.44 --> 607.94]  You're hearing me prepare you for that.
[608.32 --> 611.70]  He says to the church that's fighting and quarreling and living with selfish ambitions
[611.70 --> 613.18]  that are competing with one another, he says,
[613.18 --> 621.42]  You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world means enmity with God?
[622.04 --> 626.74]  Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
[626.82 --> 628.04]  And Steve, just keep that up there.
[629.10 --> 632.20]  I want to just let that sit there and ask you the question,
[632.42 --> 635.68]  what sort of percolates in you as you read this challenging passage?
[636.94 --> 641.56]  What thoughts come to mind about what it means to be a friend of the world and an enemy of God?
[643.18 --> 646.50]  I had within me a desire to move over this passage quickly in my sermon prep
[646.50 --> 648.20]  because it's like just so challenging.
[648.70 --> 650.98]  And then I realized I needed to let it sit with me.
[651.42 --> 654.94]  And I needed to allow it to diagnose me and what this means.
[654.94 --> 659.48]  And I want to just take a few minutes to tease out what in the world he means by friendship with the world.
[660.44 --> 663.68]  We say often behind this pulpit that the creation is good.
[664.36 --> 666.12]  So that's not what James is saying.
[666.60 --> 669.58]  What James is talking about is the way in which we align ourselves
[669.58 --> 675.62]  and we pursue the corrupt desires that sinful people have and sinful institutions have.
[676.28 --> 682.24]  That is to say, when you align yourself with different idols or different cultural ambitions
[682.24 --> 685.50]  that are not in keeping with the Lord's will, you are becoming a friend of the world.
[685.58 --> 686.42]  That's how James puts it.
[686.94 --> 690.20]  And in Rome, there is obsession with power.
[690.84 --> 692.80]  There is unbelievable greed.
[693.32 --> 695.22]  There is a desire to elevate your status
[695.22 --> 698.54]  and make other people know how much higher your status was than theirs.
[698.82 --> 703.96]  And James is saying, you are more aligned with that vision of what it means to be human
[703.96 --> 706.70]  than what the scriptures are teaching you about the way of Christ.
[707.14 --> 708.86]  You are being a friend of the Roman culture.
[709.42 --> 711.60]  And the same could be true of every culture.
[712.32 --> 718.16]  And just to give us a poignant way that we see another passage speaking into this friendship with the world,
[718.16 --> 721.20]  let me read for us what 1 John 2 says.
[722.08 --> 723.32]  And I think he illuminates this.
[723.32 --> 725.90]  He writes, not just friendship, but about love.
[726.00 --> 726.18]  He says,
[726.26 --> 728.40]  Do not love the world or anything in the world.
[728.96 --> 733.10]  If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them.
[733.80 --> 735.46]  For everything in the world, and here we get it,
[735.52 --> 740.98]  the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life
[740.98 --> 744.28]  come not from the Father, but from the world.
[745.50 --> 746.18]  You getting at that?
[746.28 --> 750.14]  Sort of aligning yourself with corrupt desires that take shape in your culture.
[750.14 --> 752.58]  And I can't help but read that line,
[752.72 --> 755.70]  the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life,
[755.76 --> 759.00]  and think, that kind of describes Western society.
[759.48 --> 759.72]  No?
[761.14 --> 766.80]  Doesn't it seem like our whole society is organized around insatiable wants?
[767.86 --> 768.74]  Would you agree with that?
[769.94 --> 771.42]  You want to have a good life?
[771.48 --> 772.44]  You want to experience pleasure?
[772.84 --> 773.68]  Go for it.
[773.68 --> 776.80]  You want to gratify the desires of your sexual appetite?
[777.20 --> 779.36]  You do whatever you want to do.
[779.70 --> 781.96]  You want to have power and prestige and money?
[782.46 --> 783.30]  Run for it.
[783.36 --> 783.98]  Do what you want to do.
[784.06 --> 787.96]  And don't let anyone tell you what you can't do.
[788.64 --> 789.38]  Does that sound about right?
[790.52 --> 792.42]  Does that sound about relevant to our context?
[792.78 --> 793.44]  And James would say,
[793.52 --> 796.16]  Hey, by the way, you should know that that's friendship with the world.
[796.42 --> 799.34]  And that puts you in an enemy position with the Father.
[799.34 --> 804.94]  And even more challenging, perhaps, is the word he uses to describe a church
[804.94 --> 806.62]  that's chasing after these idols,
[806.74 --> 809.56]  that's chasing after a different vision of the good life than what Christ has left.
[809.62 --> 809.86]  He says,
[810.22 --> 812.08]  You are cheating on God.
[814.06 --> 816.90]  You're committing adultery on your heavenly Father.
[817.54 --> 818.96]  And he's using that language.
[819.10 --> 820.82]  You know, I've been told by people,
[820.94 --> 823.06]  and I've sort of witnessed this in more than one occasion,
[823.24 --> 826.98]  that adultery is one of the most painful experiences couples can go through.
[826.98 --> 829.34]  And I'm guessing there's a few people in this room that know that.
[829.92 --> 832.66]  That most intimate bond you have in marriage is broken
[832.66 --> 837.22]  as someone cheats on you and finds someone else to enjoy their intimacy with.
[838.08 --> 840.66]  And that's the language James uses to describe a church
[840.66 --> 842.66]  that is chasing after other idols,
[843.26 --> 845.24]  that is more concerned about the pride of life,
[845.36 --> 846.92]  the lust of the eyes, and the lust of the flesh,
[847.00 --> 847.80]  than following Jesus.
[848.36 --> 851.64]  That puts them in spiritual adultery with God.
[853.40 --> 854.42]  It's at this point that I said,
[854.42 --> 855.98]  Hey, I warned you at the beginning of my sermon.
[855.98 --> 857.18]  This was a challenging sermon.
[859.00 --> 860.26]  But now let's hear some good news.
[860.34 --> 860.96]  You ready for that?
[861.40 --> 861.94]  I am.
[862.96 --> 865.32]  Next two verses, verse 5 and 6.
[865.88 --> 866.70]  James says this.
[866.80 --> 867.80]  What an intriguing passage.
[867.96 --> 868.14]  He says,
[868.26 --> 872.30]  Or do you think that Scripture says that without reason,
[872.42 --> 873.36]  he, the Father,
[873.98 --> 878.54]  jealously longs for the Spirit he has caused to dwell in us,
[878.84 --> 880.48]  but he gives us more grace?
[881.26 --> 882.20]  Now, if I had more time,
[882.26 --> 884.86]  I'd geek you out on the Greek of that sort of complicated phrase
[884.86 --> 885.72]  in the first line,
[886.02 --> 889.04]  but most translators say that that doesn't even capture the force
[889.04 --> 890.74]  of what James is trying to say.
[890.84 --> 892.24]  James is trying to say to the church,
[892.88 --> 894.08]  God, your Father,
[894.74 --> 899.00]  jealously wants you to experience the fullness of the life of the Spirit.
[899.86 --> 902.98]  He jealously wants you to return to Him
[902.98 --> 907.32]  like a husband who jealously wants his wife to be close to Him
[907.32 --> 910.48]  and experience the intimacy of being close to His heart.
[911.78 --> 913.50]  Isn't that a beautiful picture of the Father?
[914.94 --> 916.60]  Isn't that how you picture the Father?
[917.38 --> 921.20]  Who longs for you and me to be filled with the Spirit.
[921.88 --> 924.22]  You know, one of my favorite passages in Romans 5, 5,
[924.28 --> 924.60]  where it says,
[924.84 --> 927.30]  For the love of the Father has been poured into our hearts.
[927.48 --> 928.02]  Through whom?
[929.22 --> 930.14]  Through the Holy Spirit.
[931.10 --> 932.40]  Because when you're filled with the Spirit,
[932.46 --> 934.04]  when the Spirit of the living God is dwelling in you,
[934.26 --> 937.36]  you have the love of the Father radiating from within you,
[937.68 --> 938.30]  through you,
[938.56 --> 940.18]  and you change into His likeness.
[942.02 --> 942.74]  That's His heart.
[943.24 --> 943.98]  And don't miss this.
[944.06 --> 945.60]  I mean, I really want us to feel the force
[945.60 --> 946.76]  of what's going on in the church here.
[946.86 --> 951.50]  James is saying to a church that's chasing after cultural idols,
[952.04 --> 954.58]  a church that's selfish and fighting with one another
[954.58 --> 956.76]  over things that they want and can't get,
[956.76 --> 958.08]  He's saying to them,
[958.56 --> 961.90]  Do you not know the heart of the Father for the church?
[962.84 --> 966.38]  Do you not know that the Father who knew the depth of your brokenness
[966.38 --> 969.08]  sent His Son who defeated death and sin
[969.08 --> 970.26]  through the cross and His resurrection
[970.26 --> 971.74]  has now given you the Spirit,
[971.98 --> 973.78]  wants nothing more than like a husband
[973.78 --> 975.98]  for his wife to be close to his heart
[975.98 --> 977.36]  and know the depth of his love?
[978.56 --> 982.24]  That's the heart of the Father for this very broken church.
[983.38 --> 985.80]  It's the heart of the Father for every church.
[987.58 --> 990.46]  And now we get to the third move in this passage,
[990.60 --> 991.34]  the third section.
[992.28 --> 993.88]  This passage does not end with James just saying,
[993.98 --> 995.52]  Hey, that's what the Father desires for you.
[996.04 --> 999.92]  This passage ends with a very specific, clear, strong invitation
[999.92 --> 1002.24]  to humility and repentance.
[1002.68 --> 1003.24]  Let's hear it.
[1003.96 --> 1005.36]  James quotes one of his favorite books,
[1005.42 --> 1006.34]  and that is the Proverbs,
[1006.44 --> 1007.14]  and he says,
[1007.60 --> 1009.18]  God opposes the proud,
[1009.96 --> 1013.18]  but shows favor to the humble and the oppressed.
[1013.18 --> 1016.84]  And then you see this theme repeated twice in the next few verses.
[1017.00 --> 1017.24]  It says,
[1017.50 --> 1018.32]  Come near to God.
[1019.00 --> 1020.04]  He will come near to you.
[1020.82 --> 1022.40]  Humble yourselves before God,
[1022.48 --> 1024.82]  and He will lift you up.
[1025.38 --> 1026.32]  Did you hear the invitation?
[1027.34 --> 1029.56]  To a church that's chasing after all these other things,
[1029.70 --> 1030.74]  that's fighting with one another,
[1030.80 --> 1032.20]  that's using the words to kill one another,
[1032.52 --> 1033.12]  James is saying,
[1033.76 --> 1034.90]  Come back to God.
[1035.60 --> 1036.60]  Draw near to God.
[1036.96 --> 1038.00]  Humble yourselves,
[1038.00 --> 1039.80]  and you will experience His love,
[1040.10 --> 1040.78]  His closeness,
[1041.06 --> 1041.70]  His renewal,
[1041.98 --> 1042.80]  and His power.
[1044.64 --> 1047.02]  Now, just to go back to that image of the marriage
[1047.02 --> 1049.38]  that's been sort of going throughout this passage,
[1049.94 --> 1051.50]  I've been told a long time ago
[1051.50 --> 1052.82]  that the sign of a healthy marriage
[1052.82 --> 1055.08]  is not the absence of conflict.
[1056.08 --> 1056.78]  Some of you are like,
[1057.08 --> 1060.38]  The health of a marriage
[1060.38 --> 1062.70]  has more to do with the speed of reconciliation.
[1064.18 --> 1065.22]  Can you relate to that?
[1065.22 --> 1068.80]  And those of us who have experienced conflict in marriage
[1068.80 --> 1072.54]  know that there is one extremely necessary ingredient
[1072.54 --> 1073.90]  to real reconciliation.
[1074.20 --> 1074.64]  What is it?
[1077.08 --> 1078.36]  Oh, I heard a bunch of things.
[1079.92 --> 1080.36]  Humility.
[1081.76 --> 1084.34]  Humility is that thing that causes you to turn and say,
[1084.94 --> 1085.60]  I want to talk.
[1086.20 --> 1087.54]  I want to come close to you,
[1087.70 --> 1088.82]  and I want to hear your heart,
[1088.92 --> 1089.68]  and I want to reconcile.
[1090.54 --> 1091.38]  Without humility,
[1091.52 --> 1093.46]  it turns into fight part two, right?
[1093.84 --> 1094.70]  I want to talk,
[1094.70 --> 1095.74]  and here's what you did wrong.
[1096.58 --> 1097.64]  But that's not what's going on.
[1097.68 --> 1098.70]  This passage, it's saying,
[1098.88 --> 1099.52]  come near to God,
[1099.58 --> 1100.52]  and He's going to come near to you.
[1100.62 --> 1101.26]  Turn your heart,
[1101.38 --> 1103.20]  turn your posture towards Him in humility,
[1103.30 --> 1105.58]  and you're going to experience His renewal.
[1106.32 --> 1109.24]  That necessary ingredient is humility.
[1110.32 --> 1111.92]  And one author beautifully describes
[1111.92 --> 1113.62]  that invitation to turn and to repent
[1113.62 --> 1115.48]  as come home.
[1116.98 --> 1118.94]  Come back home
[1118.94 --> 1121.06]  to the Father who loves you,
[1121.44 --> 1124.48]  to the Father whose presence can transform you,
[1124.86 --> 1127.54]  to the Father who's gone all the way
[1127.54 --> 1130.78]  to redeem you from sin and pain and misery.
[1131.36 --> 1131.80]  Come home.
[1132.46 --> 1134.08]  And I can't help but look at this passage
[1134.08 --> 1137.00]  and say there is real resonance with Luke 15.
[1137.24 --> 1138.98]  And Luke 15 is the story of the prodigal son.
[1139.60 --> 1140.72]  And what's that story all about?
[1141.38 --> 1144.14]  It's about a son who has want.
[1144.78 --> 1146.94]  He wants to pursue his selfish ambitions,
[1147.06 --> 1147.84]  just like the church.
[1148.16 --> 1148.92]  And he says to his dad,
[1149.12 --> 1150.04]  let me have the money.
[1150.14 --> 1150.90]  And so he goes out,
[1150.98 --> 1151.48]  takes that money,
[1151.56 --> 1152.62]  he squanders it,
[1152.80 --> 1153.82]  he wastes it all away,
[1153.88 --> 1154.88]  and then he's in need.
[1155.10 --> 1157.78]  And that's when we see that humble turn, right?
[1158.24 --> 1160.50]  And he starts walking that long journey back home.
[1160.72 --> 1162.00]  He's reciting his apology,
[1162.18 --> 1164.72]  and he gets knocked over by the arms of his father,
[1164.72 --> 1166.48]  wrapped around him.
[1166.50 --> 1168.64]  A father who couldn't stay in the house
[1168.64 --> 1170.28]  and bolted out the front door
[1170.28 --> 1171.54]  to let his son know,
[1172.16 --> 1173.32]  this is how much I love you.
[1173.70 --> 1175.98]  This is how willing I am to receive you,
[1176.18 --> 1177.88]  and I'm so thankful you're home.
[1179.54 --> 1181.78]  That's our passage for the church.
[1183.98 --> 1185.78]  And I suppose one of the key questions
[1185.78 --> 1187.04]  that percolates within me
[1187.04 --> 1189.34]  as I sit with this passage is,
[1189.80 --> 1191.32]  how do we get that humility?
[1192.62 --> 1193.38]  Don't you ask that?
[1193.38 --> 1195.48]  How do we move from this selfish arrogance,
[1195.68 --> 1196.46]  this infighting,
[1196.52 --> 1197.82]  and this attacking with our words
[1197.82 --> 1198.94]  to humility?
[1199.42 --> 1201.20]  How do we move in such a way
[1201.20 --> 1202.92]  that we have that healthy posture
[1202.92 --> 1204.08]  that builds the unity
[1204.08 --> 1205.36]  and the health of the church?
[1206.80 --> 1208.16]  And of the many things I can say,
[1208.22 --> 1209.36]  I'm only going to say one.
[1210.78 --> 1211.98]  And that is, I think,
[1212.04 --> 1213.56]  one of the things that builds humility
[1213.56 --> 1215.16]  in all of us right here this morning
[1215.16 --> 1217.32]  is contemplating the cross.
[1219.14 --> 1220.80]  Tim Chester writes this
[1220.80 --> 1222.24]  about contemplating the cross.
[1223.38 --> 1226.18]  There is only one thing I know of
[1226.18 --> 1228.46]  that crushes me to the ground
[1228.46 --> 1230.48]  and humiliates me to the dust.
[1231.18 --> 1232.72]  And that is to look at the Son of God
[1232.72 --> 1235.04]  and especially contemplate the cross.
[1235.82 --> 1237.12]  Nothing less can do it.
[1237.52 --> 1239.50]  When I see that I am a sinner
[1239.50 --> 1241.54]  and that nothing but the Son of God
[1241.54 --> 1243.42]  on the cross can save me,
[1243.82 --> 1245.08]  I'm humbled to the dust.
[1245.12 --> 1246.20]  And here's the line that just,
[1246.74 --> 1247.36]  it's amazing.
[1247.36 --> 1249.48]  Nothing cultivates humility
[1249.48 --> 1251.08]  like the cross.
[1253.16 --> 1254.74]  And if you have ever done this,
[1255.16 --> 1257.04]  to stop and contemplate the cross,
[1257.14 --> 1258.32]  if you really take in
[1258.32 --> 1259.18]  in your devotional life,
[1259.24 --> 1259.92]  in your prayer life,
[1259.98 --> 1260.86]  in your time in your small group,
[1261.06 --> 1262.30]  what has taken place
[1262.30 --> 1263.60]  in Jesus Christ coming
[1263.60 --> 1264.68]  and defeating death,
[1264.72 --> 1265.74]  you will know that the cross
[1265.74 --> 1266.88]  changes you.
[1268.02 --> 1268.74]  It really does.
[1268.82 --> 1270.18]  It changes the way you see you.
[1270.88 --> 1271.78]  It changes the way you see
[1271.78 --> 1272.84]  the people around you.
[1272.90 --> 1273.94]  And it changes the way you see
[1273.94 --> 1274.74]  the heart of the Father.
[1274.74 --> 1276.70]  because the heart of the Father is,
[1277.10 --> 1278.18]  I will stop at nothing
[1278.18 --> 1281.20]  and give everything for you.
[1282.24 --> 1283.70]  The cross is the story of Jesus
[1283.70 --> 1285.72]  in the fullest of God
[1285.72 --> 1287.70]  and in his fullest of humility,
[1288.50 --> 1291.32]  giving his life up for us.
[1292.68 --> 1294.88]  And I've seen with my own eyes
[1294.88 --> 1296.00]  and in my own ministry here
[1296.00 --> 1296.88]  at Hope and before,
[1297.28 --> 1298.98]  the power of what happens
[1298.98 --> 1300.24]  when we take time
[1300.24 --> 1301.16]  to contemplate the cross.
[1301.26 --> 1302.70]  Can I finish with a story about that?
[1303.74 --> 1304.64]  You can say no.
[1304.74 --> 1307.38]  A number of years ago,
[1307.46 --> 1309.50]  we were doing a Lent prayer night
[1309.50 --> 1310.50]  in my former church.
[1311.40 --> 1312.12]  We had this tradition
[1312.12 --> 1312.90]  that actually we do this
[1312.90 --> 1314.58]  in our Maundy Thursday services as well.
[1315.12 --> 1316.06]  Where at the end of the service,
[1316.12 --> 1316.70]  we say to people,
[1316.88 --> 1318.54]  you can stay as long as you want
[1318.54 --> 1320.46]  and you can just come to the cross,
[1320.74 --> 1322.18]  sit in front of the cross and pray.
[1323.28 --> 1324.04]  Most of the time
[1324.04 --> 1324.86]  when we did the service,
[1325.26 --> 1325.90]  people went home.
[1326.02 --> 1326.74]  It was nine o'clock,
[1326.86 --> 1327.50]  they had things to do
[1327.50 --> 1328.14]  and people went home.
[1328.86 --> 1329.72]  One time though,
[1330.44 --> 1331.64]  there was this young guy,
[1332.58 --> 1334.08]  19 or so years old,
[1334.16 --> 1334.70]  who at the end,
[1334.78 --> 1335.60]  after everyone filed out,
[1335.62 --> 1336.48]  I was sitting around there,
[1336.70 --> 1338.22]  I saw him come to the cross
[1338.22 --> 1341.20]  and he kneeled right down
[1341.20 --> 1342.06]  in front of the cross
[1342.06 --> 1343.34]  with his arms outstretched.
[1343.94 --> 1344.98]  And I looked at him
[1344.98 --> 1346.64]  and I saw that he wasn't just crying,
[1346.72 --> 1348.00]  he was weeping.
[1349.00 --> 1350.00]  And I was stunned
[1350.00 --> 1351.26]  because this was one of those guys,
[1351.30 --> 1352.28]  I'm not going to tell his whole story,
[1352.74 --> 1354.18]  but from the outside looking in,
[1354.22 --> 1354.78]  he had it all.
[1355.08 --> 1355.78]  He was smart,
[1356.32 --> 1356.94]  good looking,
[1357.24 --> 1357.66]  athletic,
[1358.14 --> 1358.46]  musical,
[1358.46 --> 1359.54]  it's like unfair,
[1359.64 --> 1360.38]  he was the whole thing.
[1360.44 --> 1361.46]  And then there he was
[1361.46 --> 1363.18]  in front of the cross
[1363.18 --> 1364.90]  and I saw God do
[1364.90 --> 1366.02]  what only God can do,
[1366.40 --> 1367.74]  he was humbling him.
[1368.90 --> 1369.76]  And I saw the way
[1369.76 --> 1370.94]  how contemplating the cross
[1370.94 --> 1372.30]  with this 19 year old guy
[1372.30 --> 1374.10]  was making him see
[1374.10 --> 1376.52]  the power of Jesus Christ
[1376.52 --> 1379.06]  and see himself differently
[1379.06 --> 1381.90]  as he took in who Jesus is.
[1382.30 --> 1382.66]  And hope,
[1382.78 --> 1383.24]  I have to say,
[1383.28 --> 1383.98]  if there's one thing
[1383.98 --> 1384.92]  that I get out of this passage
[1384.92 --> 1385.48]  for our churches,
[1385.96 --> 1387.84]  I want us to have that humility.
[1388.46 --> 1390.62]  I want us to be those people
[1390.62 --> 1392.30]  who move from pride
[1392.30 --> 1393.02]  and selfishness
[1393.02 --> 1394.04]  and infighting and quarreling
[1394.04 --> 1394.96]  to the humility
[1394.96 --> 1395.94]  that comes from being
[1395.94 --> 1396.84]  in the presence of Jesus
[1396.84 --> 1398.06]  who gave it all for you,
[1398.72 --> 1400.02]  who gave it all for us
[1400.02 --> 1401.60]  and wants to see a community
[1401.60 --> 1403.16]  that reflects in the city
[1403.16 --> 1404.70]  his humility.
[1405.96 --> 1407.04]  Do you want that?
[1408.34 --> 1409.70]  I think our city's ready
[1409.70 --> 1410.52]  to see communities
[1410.52 --> 1411.80]  that have that kind of humility.
[1412.28 --> 1413.38]  It's ready to see churches
[1413.38 --> 1414.84]  that don't reflect the division,
[1415.00 --> 1416.24]  that don't pursue
[1416.24 --> 1417.12]  the kind of conflicts
[1417.12 --> 1418.52]  we see happening all around us,
[1418.60 --> 1419.78]  but live in this posture
[1419.78 --> 1420.66]  of humility that say
[1420.66 --> 1421.48]  we want to reflect
[1421.48 --> 1422.78]  who Jesus is
[1422.78 --> 1424.26]  in this city,
[1424.50 --> 1425.10]  in this time,
[1425.32 --> 1426.10]  in my family,
[1426.54 --> 1427.38]  in my church.
[1428.50 --> 1429.80]  That's my prayer for us.
[1430.64 --> 1431.66]  And I think the posture
[1431.66 --> 1433.58]  that moves away
[1433.58 --> 1434.72]  from conflict
[1434.72 --> 1435.50]  and quarreling
[1435.50 --> 1436.56]  and bitter division
[1436.56 --> 1438.20]  and the posture
[1438.20 --> 1439.24]  of humility comes
[1439.24 --> 1440.74]  only as we take in
[1440.74 --> 1442.06]  what Christ has done
[1442.06 --> 1442.66]  on the cross.
[1442.66 --> 1445.26]  let me lead us in prayer.
[1453.82 --> 1454.18]  Father,
[1454.24 --> 1454.84]  we want to start
[1454.84 --> 1455.44]  with gratitude
[1455.44 --> 1458.28]  for this challenging passage.
[1459.64 --> 1460.56]  And we ask that
[1460.56 --> 1461.62]  even as we hear it
[1461.62 --> 1463.04]  and process it,
[1463.10 --> 1463.64]  you would give us
[1463.64 --> 1464.16]  the humility
[1464.16 --> 1465.18]  to receive it.
[1466.22 --> 1466.78]  And if there are
[1466.78 --> 1468.04]  parts of our lives
[1468.04 --> 1468.88]  where we are just living
[1468.88 --> 1469.76]  in pure friendship
[1469.76 --> 1470.52]  with the world,
[1471.20 --> 1472.34]  would you uproot
[1472.34 --> 1473.14]  that from us?
[1474.04 --> 1474.96]  If there are ways
[1474.96 --> 1475.78]  where we are comfortably
[1475.78 --> 1477.10]  coasting in friendship
[1477.10 --> 1477.94]  with deep,
[1478.24 --> 1479.34]  profound idols,
[1480.10 --> 1481.26]  would you expose
[1481.26 --> 1482.02]  them in us?
[1482.42 --> 1483.02]  And would you,
[1483.16 --> 1483.76]  by your grace,
[1483.90 --> 1485.26]  cut them out of us?
[1486.54 --> 1488.14]  We ask for the humility
[1488.14 --> 1488.94]  of Jesus,
[1489.72 --> 1491.64]  and we ask that
[1491.64 --> 1492.40]  you would help us
[1492.40 --> 1493.08]  move along
[1493.08 --> 1493.68]  by the power
[1493.68 --> 1494.34]  of your Spirit
[1494.34 --> 1495.62]  to be those
[1495.62 --> 1496.54]  who listen,
[1497.82 --> 1498.98]  those who love,
[1500.22 --> 1501.00]  and those who seek
[1501.00 --> 1501.74]  to embody
[1501.74 --> 1503.98]  the very self-giving
[1503.98 --> 1505.06]  love of Christ
[1505.06 --> 1506.60]  in our church,
[1506.94 --> 1507.66]  in our families,
[1507.86 --> 1508.70]  and in our cities.
[1509.56 --> 1510.40]  Do that
[1510.40 --> 1510.98]  by the work
[1510.98 --> 1511.60]  of your Spirit.
[1512.72 --> 1513.00]  Amen.
[1514.86 --> 1515.78]  We're going to sing
[1515.78 --> 1517.16]  about that very humility.
[1517.40 --> 1518.20]  Let's stand and sing.
[1518.28 --> 1519.46]  Give us clean hands.
[1519.46 --> 1520.46]  Amen.
