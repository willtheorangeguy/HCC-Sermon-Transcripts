[0.00 --> 8.74]  Good morning.
[11.28 --> 14.90]  It is my privilege to be able to share God's word with you this morning.
[16.06 --> 18.74]  And thank you, Joe, again for the passionate prayer.
[19.20 --> 24.02]  Just so much passion, which is reflected in what James has to say for us as well.
[24.12 --> 29.22]  He has so much passion for the church in living as a distinct community.
[29.22 --> 33.48]  That we need to be transformed by God's Holy Spirit.
[34.34 --> 36.28]  Before we start, though, just a warning.
[36.92 --> 41.06]  One feedback that I got from the 9 a.m. service was that my sermon was so short.
[41.94 --> 45.88]  And so, I warn you, you're getting the longer version.
[47.82 --> 49.50]  Just kidding, sort of.
[51.60 --> 59.12]  And so, if you have your Bibles with you, if you would like to join me in opening up to James chapter 2.
[59.78 --> 61.32]  We will read from verse 1.
[64.64 --> 67.10]  Back in James, in chapter 2.
[68.18 --> 70.00]  We read God's word for us.
[70.00 --> 82.58]  Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes.
[82.58 --> 85.86]  And a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in.
[86.66 --> 91.82]  If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, here's a good seat for you.
[92.10 --> 94.80]  But say to the poor man, you stand there.
[95.14 --> 97.60]  Or you sit on the floor by my feet.
[98.52 --> 103.74]  Have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
[103.74 --> 107.62]  Listen, my dear brothers and sisters.
[108.02 --> 116.64]  Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?
[116.64 --> 119.26]  But you have dishonored the poor.
[120.64 --> 122.72]  Is it not the rich who are exploiting you?
[123.44 --> 126.30]  Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?
[127.04 --> 131.40]  Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong?
[131.40 --> 138.78]  If you really keep the royal law found in scripture, love your neighbor as yourself, then you are doing right.
[139.58 --> 146.68]  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.
[147.72 --> 152.96]  For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking it all.
[153.90 --> 157.66]  For he who said you shall not commit adultery also said you shall not murder.
[157.66 --> 163.66]  If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.
[165.04 --> 171.36]  And so speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom.
[172.66 --> 177.52]  Because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful.
[178.36 --> 180.54]  Mercy triumphs over judgment.
[181.36 --> 182.58]  This is the word of the Lord.
[182.58 --> 193.04]  Now before we dive into our text, it occurred to me that coming from a hierarchical culture like Korea,
[193.80 --> 200.02]  I think there is a higher danger of getting obsessed with power and status,
[200.34 --> 203.14]  which is what James is warning us about in our text this morning.
[204.32 --> 207.48]  Now out of the many instances that I had experienced or seen,
[207.48 --> 210.40]  I remember when I was a teacher back in Korea,
[211.24 --> 216.14]  we, as the whole student body of high school, went to a school camp.
[216.62 --> 218.46]  And at the resort that we were staying at,
[218.78 --> 223.98]  one of the staff came to me and scolded me, very rudely in my opinion,
[224.46 --> 227.86]  for being out of my room after curfew.
[228.92 --> 233.30]  Now I was both flattered that he thought that I looked young enough to be a high school student.
[233.30 --> 243.26]  But so weirdly satisfied when he came to apologize later for not showing me the respect that an adult,
[244.20 --> 246.80]  let alone a teacher, deserves in our society.
[247.58 --> 248.92]  Do you know who I am?
[249.82 --> 253.30]  And I remember thinking, I like that feeling,
[253.92 --> 256.44]  and that I could see myself liking more of it,
[256.86 --> 258.80]  that feeling of status and power.
[260.00 --> 261.32]  Now I don't know if you can relate.
[261.32 --> 264.10]  It might be just me and my sinfulness.
[264.46 --> 266.66]  But I have a feeling that throughout our lives,
[267.06 --> 271.62]  we may face temptations to misuse this sort of power or status.
[272.76 --> 276.40]  And so as we jump into James' warning for us as the church,
[276.78 --> 280.36]  the very first verse that we looked at sets the stage.
[281.86 --> 284.98]  And as believers, he calls to us.
[284.98 --> 292.78]  Believers, believers who have faith and full trust in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ,
[293.66 --> 295.50]  we must not show favoritism.
[295.96 --> 297.22]  That verse is so loaded.
[298.82 --> 301.64]  Believers who have a wholesome faith,
[301.76 --> 302.94]  not just head knowledge,
[303.50 --> 305.60]  not just following some religious rules,
[305.60 --> 310.02]  but a holistic faith that depends and are obedient
[310.02 --> 313.56]  and puts our full trust in the person to whom we belong,
[313.94 --> 315.74]  our glorious Lord Jesus Christ,
[315.90 --> 318.94]  who came down to us as a lowly servant.
[320.74 --> 323.38]  And I didn't share this in 9 a.m., but you get the full brunt.
[324.34 --> 328.24]  The word glorious here that describes our Lord Jesus Christ,
[328.60 --> 331.78]  it's emphasized in the word order of the original Greek syntax.
[331.78 --> 334.38]  It's at the end, doxa, saying,
[335.26 --> 337.86]  you belong to our glorious Lord Jesus Christ,
[338.08 --> 341.90]  who is king over all, but came humbly as a lowly servant.
[342.96 --> 344.32]  Know who you belong to.
[344.64 --> 346.52]  Know who your true king is.
[347.66 --> 350.82]  In light of this identity, he says simply,
[351.44 --> 353.82]  we must not show favoritism.
[356.90 --> 360.42]  Favoritism, as simple as our kids being like,
[360.42 --> 363.54]  I don't want to play with you because you look different,
[364.10 --> 365.72]  or because you smell,
[366.64 --> 369.24]  or because my mommy told me not to play with you.
[370.42 --> 372.34]  To be a little more sophisticated,
[373.24 --> 375.98]  we are warned not to show partiality,
[376.62 --> 380.52]  discrimination like racism, ageism, sexism,
[380.98 --> 383.50]  prejudice, division, tribalism.
[385.70 --> 386.38]  Why?
[387.02 --> 389.30]  James, why are you warning us about this?
[389.30 --> 391.76]  Why should we not show discrimination?
[392.10 --> 392.62]  Favoritism.
[393.90 --> 395.52]  Now, obviously, it might be silly to ask.
[396.16 --> 396.34]  Why?
[396.62 --> 398.52]  Of course we shouldn't show discrimination.
[399.32 --> 400.34]  But we ask James.
[400.60 --> 403.28]  And what James has to say specifically about this sin,
[403.88 --> 404.44]  he says,
[404.88 --> 406.30]  to show discrimination and favoritism
[406.86 --> 410.56]  is to become judges with evil thoughts.
[412.28 --> 413.98]  Judges with evil thoughts.
[413.98 --> 417.50]  And I think he means that to show favoritism
[417.50 --> 420.08]  is to reflect unrighteousness,
[420.32 --> 422.50]  which is to be a slave to sin
[422.50 --> 426.76]  and not free as God intended for us to live.
[428.08 --> 430.48]  Instead of letting God's word free us
[430.48 --> 432.22]  from a life slave to sin,
[432.38 --> 434.44]  we let the patterns of this world
[434.44 --> 437.52]  and culture to form and shape us.
[437.52 --> 441.30]  And like good wisdom literature,
[441.98 --> 443.74]  James presents us with two paths.
[444.68 --> 446.26]  One, the way of righteousness,
[447.08 --> 448.70]  to follow the royal law
[448.70 --> 450.80]  of loving your neighbor as yourself.
[451.44 --> 452.66]  And the other path,
[453.00 --> 454.48]  the way of unrighteousness,
[454.98 --> 456.64]  to let the patterns of this world
[456.64 --> 457.88]  shape our church,
[458.16 --> 458.96]  shape the church
[458.96 --> 460.46]  in showing partiality.
[460.46 --> 464.04]  This sounds much like the wisdom literature
[464.04 --> 464.80]  that we've seen,
[465.02 --> 465.92]  even in the Psalms.
[466.42 --> 467.58]  The very first verse
[467.58 --> 468.68]  of the very first Psalm
[468.68 --> 470.32]  that we looked at in our series.
[470.88 --> 472.34]  Blessed or happy
[472.34 --> 474.56]  is the one who does not walk
[474.56 --> 475.46]  in step with the wicked
[475.46 --> 478.12]  or stand in the way that sinners take
[478.12 --> 480.00]  or sit in the company of mockers,
[480.38 --> 482.32]  but blessed are those
[482.32 --> 484.24]  who meditate on God's word
[484.24 --> 485.56]  day and night.
[487.00 --> 488.26]  Also in Proverbs,
[488.26 --> 491.04]  those who despise their neighbors
[491.04 --> 491.66]  are sinners,
[492.66 --> 495.00]  but happy and blessed are those
[495.00 --> 496.78]  who are kind to the poor.
[499.14 --> 500.94]  Paul even echoes James
[500.94 --> 502.40]  as they both testify
[502.40 --> 503.52]  to the same predicament
[503.52 --> 504.78]  that was happening in the church.
[505.38 --> 506.52]  In Romans 12, 2,
[506.88 --> 507.44]  Paul says,
[507.82 --> 508.74]  Do not conform
[508.74 --> 510.44]  to the patterns of this world,
[511.14 --> 512.18]  but be transformed
[512.18 --> 513.80]  by the renewing of your mind.
[515.30 --> 516.52]  Do not conform
[516.52 --> 517.64]  to the patterns of this world.
[519.24 --> 520.92]  And James is reiterating
[520.92 --> 521.62]  to a church
[521.62 --> 523.02]  that was showing signs
[523.02 --> 523.94]  of being conformed
[523.94 --> 524.38]  to the world
[524.38 --> 525.44]  instead of witnessing
[525.44 --> 526.56]  to the good news
[526.56 --> 527.42]  of freedom
[527.42 --> 528.70]  from that life of sin.
[531.06 --> 532.22]  And so the example
[532.22 --> 533.56]  that James portrays for us
[533.56 --> 534.56]  in verses 2 to 3
[534.56 --> 535.56]  that we looked at
[535.56 --> 536.68]  may seem like
[536.68 --> 538.16]  an unreal
[538.16 --> 539.96]  or even a childish example.
[541.24 --> 542.94]  We read in verse 2 to 3,
[542.94 --> 544.28]  Suppose a man comes
[544.28 --> 544.88]  into your meeting
[544.88 --> 546.46]  wearing a gold ring,
[546.88 --> 548.04]  literally golden fingers,
[548.40 --> 549.28]  and fine clothes,
[549.36 --> 550.14]  and a poor man
[550.14 --> 551.02]  also comes in
[551.02 --> 552.26]  with filthy clothes.
[552.82 --> 554.36]  If you show special attention
[554.36 --> 554.82]  to the man
[554.82 --> 555.76]  wearing fine clothes
[555.76 --> 556.12]  and say,
[556.40 --> 557.58]  Here's a good seat for you.
[558.38 --> 559.16]  We like you.
[560.50 --> 561.66]  But say to the poor man,
[561.92 --> 562.72]  Why are you here?
[563.38 --> 564.38]  Can you stand there?
[564.78 --> 566.18]  Or you sit by my feet?
[566.80 --> 568.64]  Which is very disrespectful.
[570.88 --> 571.84]  Now I remember
[571.84 --> 573.16]  when I first read this
[573.16 --> 575.42]  or when I was reading this
[575.42 --> 576.02]  for the first time
[576.02 --> 576.86]  preparing for the sermon,
[577.14 --> 578.02]  thinking in my head,
[578.54 --> 579.74]  There's no way
[579.74 --> 580.86]  that James is speaking
[580.86 --> 581.72]  to our church,
[582.42 --> 582.72]  Hope.
[583.92 --> 584.94]  There's no way
[584.94 --> 586.24]  that anyone here,
[586.52 --> 587.48]  anyone in our church
[587.48 --> 588.74]  would explicitly
[588.74 --> 590.00]  and blatantly show
[590.00 --> 591.12]  this kind of discrimination
[591.12 --> 592.54]  for the poor.
[592.54 --> 596.50]  I remember thinking,
[596.72 --> 597.76]  No, our church is perfect.
[600.12 --> 601.06]  Such a naive
[601.06 --> 602.12]  and innocent Jonathan
[602.12 --> 603.22]  thinking that our church
[603.22 --> 603.80]  is perfect.
[604.06 --> 605.22]  As if our church,
[605.28 --> 606.54]  or any church for that matter,
[606.80 --> 607.38]  is a place
[607.38 --> 608.32]  where only saints
[608.32 --> 609.20]  gather together
[609.20 --> 609.68]  to worship.
[612.06 --> 613.04]  The church,
[613.30 --> 614.36]  we keep saying,
[615.16 --> 616.30]  and we know to be true,
[616.48 --> 617.10]  is a place
[617.10 --> 618.28]  where broken sinners
[618.28 --> 619.20]  come together
[619.20 --> 620.90]  to try our best,
[621.14 --> 621.88]  to try
[621.88 --> 623.04]  to live
[623.04 --> 624.10]  in reflection
[624.10 --> 625.02]  of God's kingdom
[625.02 --> 626.96]  where compassion
[626.96 --> 627.80]  and equality
[627.80 --> 628.68]  is the standard.
[630.46 --> 631.58]  Broken sinners
[631.58 --> 632.32]  coming together.
[634.04 --> 634.52]  And so,
[634.96 --> 635.86]  playing favorites
[635.86 --> 637.74]  and discrimination
[637.74 --> 639.24]  may not be evident
[639.24 --> 640.68]  externally for us.
[641.74 --> 642.46]  You may think
[642.46 --> 643.56]  that this particular
[643.56 --> 644.62]  struggle or sin
[644.62 --> 646.42]  does not pertain to us.
[647.64 --> 648.76]  But what goes on
[648.76 --> 649.82]  in our hearts sometimes,
[649.82 --> 651.60]  especially,
[651.84 --> 652.40]  I think,
[652.58 --> 653.84]  when conflict happens
[653.84 --> 655.26]  in the church.
[656.64 --> 657.08]  Yes,
[657.16 --> 657.88]  conflict happens
[657.88 --> 658.40]  in the church.
[658.98 --> 659.82]  And we sinners
[659.82 --> 661.10]  have a tendency
[661.10 --> 662.38]  of using
[662.38 --> 663.58]  that status card
[663.58 --> 665.00]  to try and beat
[665.00 --> 665.68]  the other person
[665.68 --> 666.72]  we're in conflict with.
[666.88 --> 667.92]  As if being in,
[668.20 --> 669.68]  as if the solution
[669.68 --> 670.42]  to conflict
[670.42 --> 671.44]  is to beat
[671.44 --> 672.16]  the other person.
[673.48 --> 674.16]  And so,
[674.24 --> 674.76]  when we do
[674.76 --> 675.56]  come in conflict
[675.56 --> 676.10]  with someone,
[676.98 --> 678.02]  we instinctively
[678.02 --> 678.72]  want to pull out
[678.72 --> 679.62]  that status card
[679.62 --> 681.58]  and ask this question,
[682.14 --> 683.24]  do you know
[683.24 --> 683.92]  who I am?
[686.32 --> 687.48]  I'm the pastor.
[689.00 --> 689.88]  I'm the son
[689.88 --> 690.66]  of so-and-so.
[690.92 --> 691.74]  You can't speak
[691.74 --> 692.46]  to me this way.
[695.56 --> 696.98]  But here's the key.
[698.26 --> 699.42]  We try
[699.42 --> 700.30]  and live
[700.30 --> 701.26]  in that reflection
[701.26 --> 702.12]  of God's kingdom,
[702.48 --> 703.28]  even in the midst
[703.28 --> 704.18]  of our brokenness.
[704.58 --> 705.80]  Where James echoes
[705.80 --> 706.24]  Jesus,
[706.50 --> 706.98]  who said,
[706.98 --> 708.38]  blessed are the poor
[708.38 --> 708.96]  in spirit,
[709.62 --> 710.44]  for theirs is
[710.44 --> 711.26]  the kingdom of heaven.
[712.86 --> 714.32]  Working out our faith
[714.32 --> 715.54]  holistically
[715.54 --> 717.26]  through our deeds
[717.26 --> 718.54]  with the guidance
[718.54 --> 719.22]  and empowering
[719.22 --> 720.12]  of the Holy Spirit,
[720.80 --> 722.46]  while always acknowledging
[722.46 --> 723.94]  our own faults,
[724.38 --> 724.96]  shortcomings,
[725.32 --> 726.38]  and being humble enough
[726.38 --> 727.02]  to realize
[727.02 --> 727.90]  that we don't always
[727.90 --> 729.04]  have everything together.
[731.20 --> 731.84]  Faith
[731.84 --> 733.24]  and works.
[733.24 --> 735.76]  And so to reflect
[735.76 --> 736.88]  specifically
[736.88 --> 737.54]  to the sin
[737.54 --> 738.32]  of favoritism
[738.32 --> 740.42]  in our passage today,
[740.76 --> 742.10]  part of our own realization
[742.10 --> 743.28]  of this working out
[743.28 --> 743.92]  of our faith
[743.92 --> 744.96]  is to care
[744.96 --> 745.60]  for the poor
[745.60 --> 746.30]  and the oppressed,
[746.56 --> 748.30]  to not show partiality
[748.30 --> 749.02]  against them
[749.02 --> 750.54]  because of what the world
[750.54 --> 751.52]  is telling us to do,
[752.10 --> 753.44]  because of what our culture
[753.44 --> 754.90]  is dragging us toward.
[756.18 --> 756.94]  You see,
[757.06 --> 758.26]  in the Roman world
[758.26 --> 758.84]  of James,
[759.16 --> 760.38]  that James is writing to,
[760.38 --> 762.34]  the society and culture
[762.34 --> 763.10]  was enmeshed
[763.10 --> 764.06]  with a thirst
[764.06 --> 764.92]  for that status
[764.92 --> 765.44]  and power.
[766.28 --> 766.92]  And sometimes
[766.92 --> 768.46]  that didn't even pertain
[768.46 --> 769.34]  to being wealthy
[769.34 --> 770.32]  or having a lot of money.
[771.18 --> 771.96]  That's the same thing.
[772.88 --> 774.10]  The main focus
[774.10 --> 775.26]  was about status
[775.26 --> 775.86]  and power.
[777.24 --> 778.78]  It's not too different
[778.78 --> 779.54]  from our society,
[779.64 --> 780.02]  I think,
[780.32 --> 781.24]  where we mark
[781.24 --> 782.18]  our own status
[782.18 --> 783.16]  and power
[783.16 --> 784.52]  with where we work,
[785.22 --> 786.42]  with what we buy,
[786.74 --> 787.48]  what we wear,
[787.98 --> 790.30]  what we listen to,
[791.16 --> 792.26]  what we consume.
[794.24 --> 795.56]  A commentator writes
[795.56 --> 797.38]  how to the Roman world,
[797.94 --> 798.84]  the Christian church
[798.84 --> 799.64]  was but another
[799.64 --> 800.72]  of these collegia,
[801.22 --> 802.30]  which is just their way
[802.30 --> 802.88]  of saying like
[802.88 --> 803.64]  a social club.
[804.98 --> 806.00]  And so to the Roman world,
[806.08 --> 806.68]  the Christian church
[806.68 --> 807.30]  was but another
[807.30 --> 808.98]  of these social clubs,
[809.28 --> 810.20]  another avenue
[810.20 --> 811.50]  that afforded the wealthy
[811.50 --> 812.30]  an opportunity
[812.30 --> 813.14]  to demonstrate
[813.14 --> 814.18]  their superiority
[814.18 --> 815.14]  over others.
[816.50 --> 817.64]  That was what was
[817.64 --> 818.48]  happening in the church.
[819.06 --> 819.68]  This means that
[819.68 --> 820.72]  for James' congregation
[820.72 --> 821.82]  that he is writing to,
[822.36 --> 823.00]  they were threatened
[823.00 --> 823.98]  to not create
[823.98 --> 824.70]  a community
[824.70 --> 825.50]  of compassion
[825.50 --> 826.30]  and equality,
[827.24 --> 828.78]  which is God's kingdom
[828.78 --> 829.22]  on earth,
[829.44 --> 830.96]  but one of social
[830.96 --> 831.70]  stratification
[831.70 --> 832.48]  and privilege.
[834.54 --> 835.74]  So the church,
[835.96 --> 836.34]  ironically,
[836.94 --> 838.04]  was favoring those
[838.04 --> 838.82]  who were the ones
[838.82 --> 839.92]  who were actually
[839.92 --> 840.86]  showing injustice
[840.86 --> 841.72]  to their community
[841.72 --> 842.36]  and society.
[842.70 --> 843.48]  It was the rich
[843.48 --> 844.46]  that were unjustly
[844.46 --> 845.40]  oppressing the poor
[845.40 --> 846.46]  through the court systems
[846.46 --> 847.74]  and taking away
[847.74 --> 849.60]  the land of the poor.
[851.92 --> 853.30]  This is so similar
[853.30 --> 853.88]  to the ancient
[853.88 --> 854.86]  Near Eastern context
[854.86 --> 855.70]  of the Old Testament.
[857.32 --> 858.52]  James is very likely
[858.52 --> 860.42]  echoing Leviticus 19.15
[860.42 --> 861.86]  where it says,
[862.66 --> 864.22]  Do not pervert justice.
[865.30 --> 866.84]  Do not show partiality
[866.84 --> 867.52]  to the poor
[867.52 --> 868.62]  or favoritism
[868.62 --> 869.20]  to the great,
[869.20 --> 870.26]  but judge
[870.26 --> 871.42]  your neighbor fairly.
[871.42 --> 874.24]  You see,
[874.40 --> 875.32]  this injustice
[875.32 --> 876.34]  that was happening
[876.34 --> 877.62]  was a pattern
[877.62 --> 878.26]  of the world.
[878.74 --> 879.76]  And this injustice
[879.76 --> 880.88]  was happening
[880.88 --> 881.58]  in the ancient
[881.58 --> 882.66]  Near Eastern times
[882.66 --> 883.50]  as well as
[883.50 --> 884.24]  the Roman society
[884.24 --> 885.00]  in the first century.
[886.18 --> 887.58]  But is that a surprise
[887.58 --> 888.20]  for us today?
[888.68 --> 889.58]  That that same
[889.58 --> 890.48]  pattern of the world,
[890.74 --> 891.62]  that same sin
[891.62 --> 892.64]  of showing favoritism
[892.64 --> 893.66]  against the poor
[893.66 --> 894.98]  is evident
[894.98 --> 895.84]  in the ancient
[895.84 --> 897.44]  Old Testament times
[897.44 --> 898.22]  as well as
[898.22 --> 898.98]  the first century
[898.98 --> 900.10]  New Testament times
[900.10 --> 901.08]  as well as
[901.08 --> 902.06]  all throughout history
[902.06 --> 903.54]  including ours today.
[906.18 --> 907.56]  Is it a surprise
[907.56 --> 909.44]  where I find this stat
[909.44 --> 911.80]  that 85% of the wealth
[911.80 --> 913.76]  of the global wealth today
[913.76 --> 915.36]  is owned by the richest
[915.36 --> 917.60]  10% of the world's population
[917.60 --> 919.24]  while the bottom half,
[920.04 --> 921.74]  meaning the bottom 50%
[921.74 --> 923.60]  of the whole world's population,
[924.06 --> 925.52]  own just 1%
[925.52 --> 926.50]  of the global wealth?
[926.50 --> 929.52]  Now these numbers
[929.52 --> 930.18]  may not be
[930.18 --> 931.10]  totally accurate,
[931.88 --> 933.02]  but I would guess
[933.02 --> 934.20]  that this is pretty close.
[935.10 --> 936.38]  A pattern of this world
[936.38 --> 937.48]  that is reflected.
[938.66 --> 939.22]  And I think
[939.22 --> 940.34]  I can trust Google
[940.34 --> 941.02]  for this stat.
[942.18 --> 943.18]  But to be clear,
[944.28 --> 945.52]  James is not just
[945.52 --> 946.12]  warning us
[946.12 --> 947.48]  simply about money
[947.48 --> 947.98]  and wealth.
[949.68 --> 950.72]  Money is not
[950.72 --> 951.76]  inherently evil.
[953.20 --> 954.02]  Money, I believe,
[954.02 --> 955.42]  is also part
[955.42 --> 956.68]  of our created world
[956.68 --> 958.02]  where we are called
[958.02 --> 959.04]  to be good stewards
[959.04 --> 959.48]  of it.
[960.86 --> 962.20]  How we treat money
[962.20 --> 963.72]  like worshipping money
[963.72 --> 964.84]  by being greedy
[964.84 --> 966.46]  or what we do with it
[966.46 --> 967.82]  is what can become sin.
[969.92 --> 971.22]  What James' church
[971.22 --> 971.82]  was becoming
[971.82 --> 972.72]  was a church
[972.72 --> 973.30]  that started
[973.30 --> 974.16]  to prioritize
[974.16 --> 975.80]  status and power
[975.80 --> 976.96]  which was rooted
[976.96 --> 978.10]  in unjust
[978.10 --> 979.84]  distribution of wealth.
[979.84 --> 984.80]  And so the challenge
[984.80 --> 985.42]  for us, hope,
[985.88 --> 986.98]  is that we cannot
[986.98 --> 988.16]  let this narrative,
[988.60 --> 989.26]  this pattern
[989.26 --> 989.82]  of the world
[989.82 --> 991.18]  be our narrative
[991.18 --> 992.30]  or our pattern.
[994.48 --> 995.36]  Paul says
[995.36 --> 996.78]  do not conform
[996.78 --> 997.38]  to the patterns
[997.38 --> 998.02]  of this world,
[999.32 --> 1000.22]  but be transformed
[1000.22 --> 1001.10]  by the renewing
[1001.10 --> 1001.68]  of your mind.
[1002.14 --> 1003.22]  Be transformed,
[1003.82 --> 1004.20]  passive,
[1004.58 --> 1005.58]  by the Holy Spirit.
[1005.58 --> 1008.78]  How can we,
[1009.28 --> 1010.18]  then we turn around
[1010.18 --> 1010.72]  the question,
[1011.18 --> 1011.86]  how can we
[1011.86 --> 1013.10]  as a church, hope,
[1013.50 --> 1014.26]  stand against
[1014.26 --> 1014.84]  the world's
[1014.84 --> 1015.92]  pattern of discrimination
[1015.92 --> 1016.82]  against the poor?
[1017.50 --> 1018.36]  How can we
[1018.36 --> 1019.26]  be good witnesses
[1019.26 --> 1020.04]  to the gospel?
[1022.56 --> 1023.12]  Practically,
[1023.72 --> 1024.38]  giving money
[1024.38 --> 1025.12]  and stewarding
[1025.12 --> 1026.36]  your finances wisely.
[1027.06 --> 1027.36]  Yes.
[1028.00 --> 1029.32]  Giving to the church more.
[1029.92 --> 1030.36]  Yes.
[1031.16 --> 1032.00]  Dave keeps saying
[1032.00 --> 1032.96]  that's his favorite one.
[1033.78 --> 1034.66]  Just kidding.
[1034.66 --> 1036.32]  But also,
[1036.46 --> 1036.88]  I think,
[1037.16 --> 1037.68]  importantly,
[1037.90 --> 1038.62]  money, yes,
[1038.82 --> 1040.68]  but also your time
[1040.68 --> 1041.42]  and effort
[1041.42 --> 1042.14]  and energy
[1042.14 --> 1043.62]  to serve others
[1043.62 --> 1045.38]  just as we commission
[1045.38 --> 1045.92]  our deacons
[1045.92 --> 1046.58]  and elders today.
[1047.28 --> 1049.00]  To give your time,
[1049.22 --> 1050.10]  your energy
[1050.10 --> 1051.58]  to serve others
[1051.58 --> 1053.18]  and to treat everyone,
[1053.68 --> 1055.00]  everyone in our church,
[1055.64 --> 1056.92]  everyone in our community
[1056.92 --> 1058.06]  that we get to serve
[1058.06 --> 1059.78]  with equality
[1059.78 --> 1060.76]  and compassion.
[1060.76 --> 1064.90]  simply put,
[1065.14 --> 1065.74]  the church,
[1065.92 --> 1066.56]  our church,
[1066.68 --> 1067.66]  any church today
[1067.66 --> 1069.10]  should never be a place
[1069.10 --> 1070.74]  that reflects the power
[1070.74 --> 1072.28]  and status honoring place
[1072.28 --> 1073.16]  that shapes
[1073.16 --> 1074.50]  our capitalistic society.
[1078.88 --> 1080.34]  And don't make the mistake
[1080.34 --> 1082.06]  that this sort of struggle
[1082.06 --> 1083.62]  is only for the churches
[1083.62 --> 1084.30]  down south
[1084.30 --> 1085.78]  in the U.S.,
[1085.78 --> 1087.04]  where there's so much politics
[1087.04 --> 1087.96]  involved in the churches.
[1087.96 --> 1089.20]  No,
[1089.46 --> 1090.54]  it sits in our hearts
[1090.54 --> 1090.96]  as well.
[1094.28 --> 1095.90]  But what is the gospel,
[1096.78 --> 1097.68]  the good news
[1097.68 --> 1098.50]  for us this morning?
[1099.74 --> 1100.38]  Is it just,
[1100.60 --> 1101.38]  is James just
[1101.38 --> 1102.66]  requiring some sort
[1102.66 --> 1103.26]  of religious
[1103.26 --> 1104.78]  obedience
[1104.78 --> 1106.18]  to another thing
[1106.18 --> 1107.04]  called favoritism?
[1107.24 --> 1108.44]  We check this box off
[1108.44 --> 1108.86]  and we say,
[1108.94 --> 1109.42]  yes, okay,
[1109.46 --> 1110.10]  we've done that,
[1110.30 --> 1110.80]  we're fine.
[1110.80 --> 1112.90]  Is it just enough
[1112.90 --> 1115.02]  to follow that law
[1115.02 --> 1115.48]  and say,
[1115.94 --> 1116.32]  we're okay?
[1118.76 --> 1120.46]  In verses 9 to 11,
[1121.36 --> 1122.10]  James demands
[1122.10 --> 1122.92]  something of us
[1122.92 --> 1124.14]  which reflects also
[1124.14 --> 1124.92]  what Paul says
[1124.92 --> 1126.96]  in Romans 3, 23.
[1127.98 --> 1128.76]  It says that,
[1128.96 --> 1129.82]  Paul says,
[1130.34 --> 1131.50]  that all have sinned
[1131.50 --> 1132.58]  and fall short
[1132.58 --> 1133.56]  of the glory of the Lord.
[1134.48 --> 1135.66]  And what Paul is saying
[1135.66 --> 1137.02]  is exactly what James
[1137.02 --> 1137.44]  is saying
[1137.44 --> 1138.04]  in our verses,
[1138.60 --> 1139.36]  in our chapter,
[1139.36 --> 1141.02]  where James says,
[1141.68 --> 1143.34]  but if you show favoritism,
[1143.74 --> 1144.38]  you sin
[1144.38 --> 1145.14]  and are convicted
[1145.14 --> 1145.76]  by the law
[1145.76 --> 1146.70]  as lawbreakers.
[1147.22 --> 1148.26]  For whoever keeps
[1148.26 --> 1149.10]  the whole law
[1149.10 --> 1150.12]  and yet stumbles
[1150.12 --> 1151.66]  at just one point
[1151.66 --> 1153.08]  is guilty of it all.
[1155.90 --> 1157.24]  So what is James
[1157.24 --> 1158.58]  expecting out of us
[1158.58 --> 1159.42]  as the church?
[1161.02 --> 1162.26]  You ask James,
[1163.00 --> 1164.82]  so what do you want?
[1165.10 --> 1165.96]  What are you expecting?
[1166.80 --> 1167.72]  What do you want us
[1167.72 --> 1168.32]  to reflect?
[1168.32 --> 1169.58]  Perfection?
[1170.66 --> 1171.22]  Yes.
[1172.22 --> 1173.88]  That's one of the key words
[1173.88 --> 1174.80]  all throughout James
[1174.80 --> 1175.34]  as a book.
[1176.54 --> 1177.10]  Perfection.
[1177.64 --> 1178.24]  Teleos.
[1179.54 --> 1181.26]  Reflecting God's perfection,
[1181.60 --> 1182.40]  God's compassion,
[1182.74 --> 1183.82]  God's equality
[1183.82 --> 1185.36]  shown to everyone.
[1187.62 --> 1188.30]  Holiness.
[1188.76 --> 1189.86]  Without fault.
[1190.36 --> 1191.00]  Perfection.
[1193.70 --> 1194.90]  But, John,
[1194.96 --> 1195.40]  you said
[1195.40 --> 1197.38]  this was the good news.
[1197.38 --> 1199.16]  How is
[1199.16 --> 1200.88]  demanding
[1200.88 --> 1202.50]  us to live
[1202.50 --> 1203.18]  into our identity
[1203.18 --> 1204.64]  of perfection,
[1205.04 --> 1206.04]  good news for us?
[1206.94 --> 1207.44]  Isn't that
[1207.44 --> 1208.88]  impossible for us
[1208.88 --> 1209.42]  to achieve?
[1210.46 --> 1211.46]  Yes and no.
[1212.18 --> 1213.24]  It's impossible
[1213.24 --> 1214.50]  by our own strength.
[1216.04 --> 1216.80]  But James,
[1216.96 --> 1217.24]  remember,
[1217.66 --> 1218.78]  is writing to us
[1218.78 --> 1219.54]  as the church
[1219.54 --> 1220.82]  with the full
[1220.82 --> 1221.68]  expectancy
[1221.68 --> 1223.38]  that we will
[1223.38 --> 1224.42]  grow in faith.
[1224.80 --> 1225.52]  We will
[1225.52 --> 1226.66]  grow in holiness.
[1227.64 --> 1228.04]  Why?
[1229.94 --> 1231.10]  Because we have
[1231.10 --> 1232.48]  God's Holy Spirit
[1232.48 --> 1233.62]  dwelling with us.
[1235.82 --> 1237.32]  He makes it possible.
[1237.32 --> 1240.98]  And so,
[1241.06 --> 1241.76]  the last part
[1241.76 --> 1242.62]  of James 2
[1242.62 --> 1243.40]  that we looked at,
[1244.52 --> 1245.16]  he says that
[1245.16 --> 1245.70]  we live
[1245.70 --> 1246.76]  in light of mercy
[1246.76 --> 1248.38]  because we are
[1248.38 --> 1249.18]  guilty of sin,
[1249.30 --> 1249.56]  yes.
[1250.22 --> 1250.42]  Yet,
[1250.58 --> 1251.22]  through the love
[1251.22 --> 1251.92]  of the Father,
[1252.26 --> 1253.14]  through the obedience
[1253.14 --> 1254.10]  of the Son,
[1254.46 --> 1255.26]  we have been shown
[1255.26 --> 1255.70]  mercy.
[1256.44 --> 1256.74]  Hence,
[1256.88 --> 1257.54]  James states,
[1258.12 --> 1259.44]  mercy triumphs
[1259.44 --> 1260.24]  over judgment.
[1262.16 --> 1263.30]  In light of this
[1263.30 --> 1263.72]  mercy,
[1263.72 --> 1264.86]  we are called
[1264.86 --> 1265.58]  to speak
[1265.58 --> 1266.28]  and act,
[1266.56 --> 1267.08]  which means
[1267.08 --> 1267.88]  we are called
[1267.88 --> 1268.42]  to live
[1268.42 --> 1269.40]  our whole lives
[1269.40 --> 1270.32]  as those
[1270.32 --> 1270.82]  who are going
[1270.82 --> 1271.46]  to be judged
[1271.46 --> 1272.22]  by the law
[1272.22 --> 1273.00]  that gives us
[1273.00 --> 1273.52]  freedom.
[1275.06 --> 1275.96]  Might sound
[1275.96 --> 1276.94]  like an oxymoron.
[1277.54 --> 1277.90]  Law?
[1278.72 --> 1279.16]  Freedom.
[1280.76 --> 1282.04]  Law that gives
[1282.04 --> 1282.66]  us freedom?
[1284.24 --> 1284.64]  Yes.
[1285.36 --> 1286.22]  God's law.
[1286.46 --> 1287.32]  Not just any law.
[1287.70 --> 1288.80]  God's word for us.
[1289.10 --> 1289.96]  God's law
[1289.96 --> 1291.20]  that gives us
[1291.20 --> 1291.64]  freedom
[1291.64 --> 1292.80]  to live righteously.
[1293.98 --> 1294.38]  Again,
[1294.62 --> 1295.18]  as God
[1295.18 --> 1295.94]  our loving Father
[1295.94 --> 1297.84]  intended for us
[1297.84 --> 1298.32]  to live.
[1299.52 --> 1300.44]  And this is only
[1300.44 --> 1301.28]  possible through
[1301.28 --> 1302.00]  His Holy Spirit.
[1303.28 --> 1304.30]  We see this
[1304.30 --> 1305.24]  beautiful work
[1305.24 --> 1306.72]  of our triune God
[1306.72 --> 1307.48]  working here
[1307.48 --> 1308.22]  where
[1308.22 --> 1310.26]  the loving mercy
[1310.26 --> 1311.04]  of the Father
[1311.04 --> 1312.26]  through the Son,
[1312.38 --> 1313.10]  Jesus Christ,
[1313.62 --> 1314.52]  works in us
[1314.52 --> 1315.86]  through His Holy Spirit
[1315.86 --> 1317.08]  enabling us
[1317.08 --> 1317.60]  to live
[1317.60 --> 1318.30]  in the way
[1318.30 --> 1319.04]  of righteousness.
[1320.82 --> 1321.38]  Yes,
[1321.46 --> 1321.90]  of course,
[1322.02 --> 1322.52]  we struggle
[1322.52 --> 1324.00]  with our own sins
[1324.00 --> 1325.86]  even as the Spirit
[1325.86 --> 1326.50]  leads us.
[1326.86 --> 1327.28]  And yes,
[1327.44 --> 1328.18]  we should
[1328.18 --> 1329.30]  and we lament
[1329.30 --> 1330.14]  at the fact
[1330.14 --> 1331.10]  of how much
[1331.10 --> 1331.76]  we try
[1331.76 --> 1332.36]  and limit
[1332.36 --> 1333.56]  the Holy Spirit
[1333.56 --> 1334.40]  working in us.
[1337.36 --> 1339.00]  But take courage
[1339.00 --> 1340.32]  and rejoice
[1340.32 --> 1342.06]  at the fact
[1342.06 --> 1343.46]  that the good news is
[1343.46 --> 1344.68]  God does never
[1344.68 --> 1345.60]  give up on us.
[1346.98 --> 1348.16]  He grants us
[1348.16 --> 1348.56]  freedom
[1348.56 --> 1349.74]  by His grace.
[1349.74 --> 1351.62]  This is His gift.
[1351.88 --> 1353.04]  This is not earned.
[1353.38 --> 1354.12]  We can never
[1354.12 --> 1354.82]  earn this.
[1355.24 --> 1355.78]  This is such
[1355.78 --> 1356.62]  a beautiful gift
[1356.62 --> 1357.72]  that was given to us
[1357.72 --> 1358.76]  that is with us
[1358.76 --> 1359.72]  through His Holy Spirit.
[1360.26 --> 1360.92]  You are free.
[1361.54 --> 1362.36]  You are free
[1362.36 --> 1363.04]  from sin.
[1363.60 --> 1364.24]  You are free
[1364.24 --> 1365.32]  to live righteously.
[1367.96 --> 1368.70]  And so,
[1368.90 --> 1369.86]  this is the encouragement
[1369.86 --> 1370.84]  for you this morning,
[1370.98 --> 1371.18]  Hope.
[1372.16 --> 1372.96]  Where the Spirit
[1372.96 --> 1373.90]  of the Lord is,
[1374.98 --> 1376.00]  there is freedom.
[1376.00 --> 1379.10]  This is a very famous song
[1379.10 --> 1380.00]  too that I used to sing
[1380.00 --> 1380.52]  when I was young.
[1380.78 --> 1381.12]  Moon said,
[1381.22 --> 1381.80]  oh, I'll sing it
[1381.80 --> 1382.44]  if you say it.
[1383.20 --> 1383.94]  Where the Spirit
[1383.94 --> 1385.32]  of the Lord is,
[1385.70 --> 1386.92]  there is freedom.
[1387.68 --> 1387.96]  Yeah,
[1388.08 --> 1388.94]  if you know the song,
[1389.14 --> 1389.84]  that's the lyrics.
[1390.56 --> 1391.20]  Where the Spirit
[1391.20 --> 1391.68]  of the Lord,
[1391.84 --> 1392.74]  there is freedom,
[1392.86 --> 1393.00]  Hope.
[1393.24 --> 1393.90]  There is freedom
[1393.90 --> 1394.34]  for you.
[1395.14 --> 1396.10]  Freedom from sin.
[1398.82 --> 1399.26]  And so,
[1399.42 --> 1400.44]  live into this freedom.
[1401.20 --> 1402.00]  Live as though
[1402.00 --> 1402.74]  you are free
[1402.74 --> 1404.64]  to show compassion
[1404.64 --> 1405.86]  to one another.
[1406.80 --> 1407.74]  Live as though
[1407.74 --> 1408.44]  you are free
[1408.44 --> 1410.46]  to treat everyone equally
[1410.46 --> 1412.14]  because we are all made
[1412.14 --> 1412.76]  in the image
[1412.76 --> 1413.42]  of our Creator.
[1414.54 --> 1415.90]  May we be able
[1415.90 --> 1417.14]  to reflect God's kingdom
[1417.14 --> 1417.88]  in this way
[1417.88 --> 1419.66]  by showing one another
[1419.66 --> 1420.40]  with compassion
[1420.40 --> 1421.74]  and equality
[1421.74 --> 1423.42]  and showing our community,
[1424.10 --> 1425.04]  especially those
[1425.04 --> 1426.12]  who we know
[1426.12 --> 1426.88]  are poor
[1426.88 --> 1427.60]  and are oppressed.
[1428.18 --> 1428.72]  Our society
[1428.72 --> 1429.56]  is not perfect.
[1430.72 --> 1431.62]  May we be able
[1431.62 --> 1432.92]  to show that compassion
[1432.92 --> 1435.10]  and that equality
[1435.10 --> 1435.72]  of God
[1435.72 --> 1436.88]  for us
[1436.88 --> 1437.64]  and our neighbors.
[1439.06 --> 1440.26]  Live into your freedom.
[1440.62 --> 1441.06]  Let's pray.
[1451.24 --> 1452.00]  Father God,
[1452.08 --> 1452.78]  we pray
[1452.78 --> 1454.50]  in gratitude
[1454.50 --> 1456.00]  and joy
[1456.00 --> 1458.86]  while also lamenting
[1458.86 --> 1459.74]  at our shortcomings.
[1459.74 --> 1462.70]  Lord,
[1462.78 --> 1463.36]  we pray
[1463.36 --> 1464.24]  as we prayed
[1464.24 --> 1464.82]  in confession
[1464.82 --> 1467.96]  that a lot
[1467.96 --> 1468.52]  of the times
[1468.52 --> 1469.80]  we do things
[1469.80 --> 1470.30]  that we are not
[1470.30 --> 1470.94]  supposed to
[1470.94 --> 1472.12]  and we don't do
[1472.12 --> 1472.74]  things that we
[1472.74 --> 1473.28]  should have done.
[1476.68 --> 1478.34]  But we take courage,
[1479.24 --> 1479.34]  Lord,
[1479.42 --> 1480.46]  because we know
[1480.46 --> 1481.74]  that by your Holy Spirit
[1481.74 --> 1482.58]  you are with us.
[1483.18 --> 1484.60]  You dwell in us.
[1485.30 --> 1486.72]  You live with us,
[1486.86 --> 1487.50]  guiding us,
[1487.92 --> 1489.00]  providing that wisdom
[1489.00 --> 1492.14]  to live righteously,
[1492.60 --> 1493.78]  to live in reflection
[1493.78 --> 1494.52]  of your kingdom.
[1497.00 --> 1498.20]  And as we witness
[1498.20 --> 1498.94]  through your word
[1498.94 --> 1499.40]  this morning,
[1499.52 --> 1499.70]  Lord,
[1500.38 --> 1501.54]  we pray
[1501.54 --> 1502.14]  that you will
[1502.14 --> 1503.34]  continue to guide us,
[1503.76 --> 1504.44]  that we will be
[1504.44 --> 1505.16]  more prone
[1505.16 --> 1506.42]  to listen to your voice,
[1506.78 --> 1507.94]  to listen to your spirit,
[1508.96 --> 1509.96]  of what you have to say
[1509.96 --> 1510.52]  to us
[1510.52 --> 1511.50]  and our community
[1511.50 --> 1512.82]  about taking care
[1512.82 --> 1513.76]  of those who are poor
[1513.76 --> 1514.98]  and who are oppressed,
[1515.88 --> 1516.80]  that we do not show
[1516.80 --> 1518.18]  discrimination against them,
[1518.18 --> 1519.42]  but we stand
[1519.42 --> 1520.22]  with them,
[1520.46 --> 1521.52]  we stand for them.
[1524.06 --> 1525.20]  So I pray,
[1525.54 --> 1525.72]  Lord,
[1526.48 --> 1527.78]  that you would be
[1527.78 --> 1529.52]  given all the glory
[1529.52 --> 1530.26]  that you deserve
[1530.26 --> 1531.56]  as we
[1531.56 --> 1532.46]  wrestle
[1532.46 --> 1533.82]  and as we journey
[1533.82 --> 1534.98]  throughout our lives
[1534.98 --> 1535.38]  of faith,
[1536.70 --> 1538.14]  living in this equality
[1538.14 --> 1539.16]  and this compassion
[1539.16 --> 1539.88]  for one another.
[1540.88 --> 1542.00]  May this blessing
[1542.00 --> 1542.94]  be on us
[1542.94 --> 1544.42]  as we live
[1544.42 --> 1545.24]  our lives.
[1545.70 --> 1546.36]  We thank you,
[1546.42 --> 1546.58]  Lord,
[1546.58 --> 1547.32]  in Jesus' name
[1547.32 --> 1547.70]  we pray.
[1548.64 --> 1548.92]  Amen.
[1548.92 --> 1549.04]  Amen.
