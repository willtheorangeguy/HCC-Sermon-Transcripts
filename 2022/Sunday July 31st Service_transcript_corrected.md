[0.00 → 5.06] so you just have to find us another Brazilian couple to replace yourself.
[6.82 → 11.82] All right, friends, we're going to jump back into our Psalms series, and the Psalms, as we've said
[11.82 → 15.68] at the beginning of this series, has been described as the prayer book of the church. It teaches us
[15.68 → 20.14] how to pray. It gives us language for lament. Furthermore, it gives language to wrestle with our doubt. Furthermore, it gives
[20.14 → 24.80] language to trust and to have faith, even in the midst of uncertainty and crisis, and this morning
[24.80 → 29.78] we're looking at Psalm 46, which is a statement, a prayer of faith in the midst of crisis.
[30.00 → 36.94] Just one week ago, my family, Brittany's family, gathered in Ontario at the funeral of Brittany's
[36.94 → 42.56] granddad, Mike and Marnie's dad, who was 94 and passed away. And at that funeral, they sang,
[42.86 → 47.78] they prayed, they shared stories of love of their dad, who died at the age of 94, and they
[47.78 → 53.86] read great-granddad's favourite psalm, which is Psalm 46. In fact, even up until a year ago,
[53.86 → 58.70] he had it memorized and recited it. And it was a psalm that just nourished his heart and his soul,
[58.70 → 63.58] and it's a delightful coincidence that I get to preach on Psalm 46 the week after this funeral,
[63.58 → 68.80] and it's an honour to do so. But I invite you, if you have your Bible, turn with me to Psalm 46.
[69.10 → 71.88] If you have it on your phone, turn with me as well, and we're going to read it together.
[71.88 → 84.26] God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear,
[84.80 → 90.60] though the earth gives way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar
[90.60 → 97.06] and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. There is a river whose streams make glad the city
[97.06 → 105.94] of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. God is within her. She will not fall. God will help
[105.94 → 113.84] her at break of day. Nations are in uproar and kingdoms fall. He lifts his voice. The earth melts.
[114.90 → 122.36] The Lord Almighty is with us. The God of Jacob is our fortress. Come and see what the Lord has done,
[122.36 → 128.82] the desolation he has brought on the earth. He makes war cease to the ends of the earth. He breaks
[128.82 → 138.18] the bow and shatters the spears. He burns the shields with fire. Be still and know that I am God. I will be
[138.18 → 146.60] exalted among the nations. I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord Almighty is with us. The God of Jacob
[146.60 → 148.28] is our fortress.
[153.06 → 158.72] One of the important questions that Psalm 46 raises for everyone who reads and prays it
[158.72 → 168.24] is where do you turn when the bottom falls out of life? Who or what do you go to when crisis becomes
[168.24 → 176.42] reality and your worst fear becomes your nightmare? Psalm 46 is written from that kind of place of need.
[177.32 → 182.92] In fact, a story that came to mind as I was working on this psalm is a story from a number of months ago
[182.92 → 188.44] when war broke out in Ukraine. You may have seen this video that circulated around social media. It
[188.44 → 193.00] was a group of people who huddled in a subway. And they huddled in the subway because that was the
[193.00 → 197.22] safe place to go when war broke out above them and there was a threat of bombs falling on their city.
[197.48 → 201.80] And they weren't just huddled in the subway in Ukraine. They were actually singing. They were praying
[201.80 → 206.78] in this subway in Ukraine. And what I learned as I researched what they were singing, and I heard
[206.78 → 211.02] from people who could translate Ukrainian, they were actually praying and singing Psalm 91
[211.02 → 216.02] in this subway. And I want to read for you just a portion of the beginning of Psalm 91, which they're
[216.02 → 220.98] likely singing. It reads, whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow
[220.98 → 228.36] of the Almighty. They say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust.
[228.98 → 232.64] Under His wings you will find refuge. And I love this. Think about Ukraine.
[232.64 → 241.24] You will not fear the terror of the night nor the arrows that fly by day. Our Ukrainian sisters and
[241.24 → 246.72] brothers were doing what generations of believers did when their greatest fear became a reality.
[247.52 → 253.90] They clung to God and prayed the Psalms. They prayed the words of faith, prayed by generations of
[253.90 → 259.48] people who went before them saying, God, here we are in a calamity. We trust you. We trust that you're
[259.48 → 263.00] going to be God, that you're going to be our refuge, and we trust you even more than that, that you're
[263.00 → 272.36] going to be the one who in your way makes peace and justice. They sang the Psalms. Most scholars
[272.36 → 279.78] suggest that the context to Isaiah, or sorry, to Psalm 46 was precisely what we see in Ukraine. In fact,
[279.78 → 287.64] Psalm 46 probably pairs with Isaiah 36, and Isaiah 36 is the story of the Assyrian army, the major empire of
[287.64 → 294.42] the day invading Israel. You can read about it. In 701, the Assyrians stormed into Israel, and they took
[294.42 → 301.54] every single city. They captured every single city except for Jerusalem. If you want to sort of imagine
[301.54 → 307.70] it as a present-day moment, it's like a country to ourselves, storming in British Columbia and taking
[307.70 → 313.56] every city except for Vancouver. And in Isaiah 36, we read that Hezekiah, the king of Israel at the time,
[313.56 → 317.88] sort of spoke to the king of Assyria saying, you will not take Jerusalem. God will fight for us. Bold
[317.88 → 322.80] words from a little country, that is Israel, speaking to Assyria, the major empire of the day. And the
[322.80 → 329.40] story of Isaiah 36 is the angel of the Lord fighting for them and defeating the army such that Jerusalem
[329.40 → 333.50] was not taken. And that's why we have words of celebration in the middle of this psalm, which is
[333.50 → 338.82] also one that cries out for help, because it's a real calamity. There are real cities around Israel that got
[338.82 → 343.30] captured by Assyria, and here are the Israelites praying words of faith and trust.
[346.10 → 352.54] One of the beautiful things of Psalm 46 is how incredibly it is crafted. You know, if you want
[352.54 → 356.52] to know how thoughtfully are psalms put together, the answer is very thoughtfully and a lot
[356.52 → 361.68] better than your university papers. Take a look at this screen. This is the organization and the
[361.68 → 368.12] repetition and the poetry of Psalm 46. I think we'll have them up there. There it is. It starts verse
[368.12 → 373.46] one saying, God is our refuge, our ever-present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear,
[373.56 → 382.08] verse two. God rules over calamity, verse three and four. God is present, verse five. Nations rage
[382.08 → 388.72] and kingdoms fall, verse six. God speaks, the earth melts. And here comes the repetition. God is present.
[389.40 → 395.64] God rules over political calamity, verse eight and nine. Be still and know that I am God, verse ten.
[395.64 → 400.54] And finally, God Almighty is with us. That's Psalm 46.
[400.54 → 406.02] And one of the things that we've said throughout this series that I appreciate about the psalm is
[406.02 → 412.40] it does not gloss over the harsh reality of life. It does not neglect to mention that the chaos of
[412.40 → 416.10] the world around them, there's political disaster around them. But what it does, and I want us to see
[416.10 → 422.70] this, it starts with God. It starts with God's character. It then moves to name the chaos of the
[422.70 → 426.38] world, the mountains falling into sea, the political disaster, the roaring of the nations.
[426.38 → 432.30] It brings those before God, and then it finishes again with God. That's the movement of Psalm 46.
[432.42 → 437.96] And let me ask, is that how we pray when our calamities befall us? Is that the movement
[437.96 → 443.80] of our hearts when our fears become realities? Starting with the character of God, bringing before
[443.80 → 449.40] Him the realities that we face that are awful, and then finishing again with trust in God? Because
[449.40 → 456.96] that's how Psalm 46 moves. Here's a question I want to ask after, actually, I'll read the passage,
[457.08 → 460.66] then I'll ask the question. This is the question that was sort of playing around in my own head as I
[460.66 → 467.14] worked on this sermon. But first let me read verse 1 and 2. We read, God is our refuge and our strength,
[467.70 → 474.92] our ever-present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth gives way and the
[474.92 → 479.96] mountains fall into the heart of the sea. Here's the question. Can we pray that with integrity?
[481.42 → 486.92] Can you and I read this Psalm as a prayer for our own lives and be honest? Did you see the movement
[486.92 → 491.16] there? God's our refuge and our strength, our ever-present help in trouble. Therefore, we will
[491.16 → 495.64] not fear, though the mountain falls in the heart of sea. And just to give you a sense of what the force
[495.64 → 499.40] of that sentence, the mountains in the ancient Near East were understood as sort of the strong
[499.40 → 504.48] pillars of the earth. And the sea represented chaos and danger and uncertainty. And what the
[504.48 → 509.64] force of this statement is, when the safety and security of life falls into the heart of the sea,
[509.84 → 518.74] we will still trust God. Or to put it very pointedly, when creation itself crumbles, we will still hold
[518.74 → 526.96] faith. Can you pray that honestly? Or to put a finer point on it, how have we prayed in this way
[526.96 → 533.34] through the last two years of the pandemic? Think of the anxiety that just covered our world.
[534.20 → 540.64] How did you pray through that? Did it look anything like Psalm 46? Did it have that kind of trust,
[540.76 → 547.50] starting with God, moving into calamity, returning to faith in God? It's inviting us to a bold, trusting
[547.50 → 552.98] faith. And the more you go into this question, you'll probably come to where I came this week is,
[552.98 → 560.14] how do I grow in that kind of faith? How do I learn to pray this kind of prayer of faith in the midst of
[560.14 → 566.88] trust and mean it and actually have that emerge from my own heart in prayer? And I want to suggest
[566.88 → 572.60] two specific ways that the Psalms themselves move in this direction. I think there are specific
[572.60 → 577.84] clues in these Psalms, specifically Psalm 46, where you see where the trust is coming from.
[577.84 → 583.48] How they come to a place of praying this prayer as Assyria invades and captures all of Israel except
[583.48 → 591.14] for Jerusalem. And the first thing we notice in Psalm 46 and so, so many other Psalms is that the God
[591.14 → 598.66] they pray to, they truly believe to be standing above creation and ruling over all the brokenness.
[598.66 → 606.30] That's such a basic and important point. God is not just part of the mess, he stands above it.
[606.82 → 612.00] And if that's true, they can say, therefore God will trust you, even though the mountains you created
[612.00 → 617.44] fall into the sea you created, we entrust our lives that you created in the midst of that chaos.
[617.88 → 623.08] You stand above it. And in case you didn't feel this when we were reading Psalm 46,
[623.08 → 631.64] the God they are praying to is a huge God. He's a huge God, right? Did you notice some of the language?
[631.76 → 636.26] He's a shelter, he's a fortress, he's an ever-present help. I love the line in verse 6,
[636.32 → 641.22] in fact, this is our great-granddad's favourite, says, the nations rage, kingdoms fall. What's next?
[642.62 → 652.10] The Lord speaks and the earth melts. Is that the content of our prayers? Is that the kind of God that we pray to?
[653.08 → 657.34] Now, I remember reading years ago a book called When People Are Big and God Is Small. Maybe you've
[657.34 → 661.04] heard that title before. And the essence of the whole book, if I could summarize it in a couple
[661.04 → 667.06] sentences, is that we as humans generally preoccupy ourselves with all the challenges that are in our
[667.06 → 671.78] lives. And they're real. Relational, economic, health challenges. We get so caught up in those,
[672.32 → 677.96] and we have this almost functional doubt. And that concerns, like, does God really see our problems?
[678.56 → 681.54] Does God concern himself with our problems? And the deepest doubt, perhaps, is,
[681.54 → 688.60] does God even have the power to deal with our problems? And Psalm 46 says, absolutely he does.
[689.46 → 696.72] And it's time we learn to call on him. It's time we learn to trust him and see how God will be God.
[697.68 → 703.88] God is huge, and he is bigger than our problems. He stands above creation and rules over it.
[703.88 → 710.04] But Psalm 46 is not blind trust. And this is, like, such an important piece. The reason the
[710.04 → 714.68] psalmist can pray this, the reason they can say this, as the Assyrians take over the place of Israel,
[715.18 → 720.14] is because God's proven his character. This is not blind trust in a God they do not know. It's a God
[720.14 → 726.54] they have seen and operation, and they have trusted him. You know, I think that most of us struggle to
[726.54 → 730.14] trust people. At least I'll speak for myself. Like, generally, when you're getting to know new people,
[730.14 → 733.40] or you're entering a new relationship, perhaps you're starting a dating relationship, you're always
[733.40 → 739.24] just discerning, can I trust this person? Do they have my best interest in mind? Are they for me?
[739.78 → 743.44] In fact, I think this is the process of conversion for most people. It's that basic question,
[743.76 → 749.18] okay, I believe there's a God. Is he good? Is he for me? Can I trust him with my life? That's often
[749.18 → 755.82] the process for many of us as we become Christians. But the psalmists are praying to a God who has proven
[755.82 → 759.92] his character. In fact, there's repeated lines in this psalm that aren't just throwaway lines,
[759.92 → 767.02] they go back to the story. They say, Psalm 1, sorry, 46, verse 1, 7, and 11 has the repeated phrases,
[767.82 → 774.60] God Almighty and God of Jacob. And that phrase, God of Jacob, right away is calling back the story.
[774.70 → 778.90] They remember what God did through Jacob. But God Almighty, even more significant, perhaps,
[779.16 → 787.10] is a phrase that God himself introduced to Abraham. When Abraham was just one guy who did not have a child
[787.10 → 790.80] with his wife, God showed up and said, Abraham, I'm pulling you into my plan. I'm going to make you a
[790.80 → 794.22] great nation. I'm going to bless you. Furthermore, I'm going to bless all the nations through you. And even Abraham
[794.22 → 800.34] and his wife were like, not so sure, right? And then God says, I am God Almighty, and I will do it
[800.34 → 808.06] in Genesis 17. And what happens? It happens. Abraham becomes a nation. That nation becomes a very large
[808.06 → 813.40] nation. They become a whole people. And God makes good on all those promises. And so when they say,
[813.40 → 818.02] you are the God of Jacob, you are the God Almighty, they are saying, you are God who's proven yourself.
[819.10 → 823.92] And there's no doubt, as many of the Psalms look back on, that they call to mind over and over again
[823.92 → 828.50] what I like to call the resurrection of the Old Testament. The resurrection of the Old Testament,
[828.62 → 834.32] the main event is the rescue from slavery. In fact, many of the Psalms just tell that story
[834.32 → 840.20] of their people back in the day for them, being slaves in Egypt, calling out in their pain,
[840.20 → 845.42] in their misery to the God they barely know, and God hears their calls, and very, very real ways,
[845.68 → 851.86] comes into the major empire of that day, Egypt, as God, and shows Egypt whose God, and in a very real
[851.86 → 858.58] way, breaks their spears, shatters their bows, and burns their shields. He showed up in power. He proved
[858.58 → 864.92] himself to be a God they could trust, a huge God who concerns himself with their suffering.
[864.92 → 872.78] The repeated phrase, though, in this Psalm, is not just that he's a big God, not just that he's the creator
[872.78 → 878.86] who stands over all the activities of this world, it's that he's near them. In verse 1, 7, 11, there's a
[878.86 → 887.44] repeated phrase, your ever-present help in trouble, God Almighty is with us. And again, God Almighty is with us.
[887.44 → 894.70] And what they would learn, as every generation of believers have to learn, including us, is that God
[894.70 → 901.62] is present. He hasn't changed. The God that they pray to when they are in crisis as Assyria invades
[901.62 → 907.66] their land is the God that we pray to right now this morning. And he is equally concerned with our
[907.66 → 913.94] calamities, our crises, our concerns, as he was for Israel. Do you believe that? Do you believe that the
[913.94 → 919.46] same God they call to is present to us this morning in our worship? And we do not believe the lie that
[919.46 → 924.18] he is unconcerned now, that somehow he has forgotten the needs of people in present-day British Columbia,
[924.28 → 929.68] here in Clayton Heights. He's a God who is deeply concerned. And what we need to learn in our lives
[929.68 → 935.52] is to believe and to trust that the way that every generation before us has. I think one of the most
[935.52 → 941.68] beautiful things about being a pastor is hearing stories from people in our church of seeing God show up.
[941.68 → 947.78] Seeing God show up when you are sort of pushed into the CAT scan at the hospital. Seeing God show up
[947.78 → 951.38] when you're holding the pink slip, and you've been let go of a position, you've got a family to feed.
[951.84 → 956.88] Seeing God show up when your spouse walks out the door. I've heard story after story in
[956.88 → 964.90] this church of God showing up. Why? Because he's God. Because your concerns are his concerns. Because
[964.90 → 970.80] your crises are things he cares about. And perhaps the activity, the takeaway activity for this morning's
[970.80 → 975.74] psalm is sitting around the lunch table with friends and family and saying, how have you discovered
[975.74 → 981.98] the faithfulness, the goodness, and the concern of God in your life? Your kids need to hear those
[981.98 → 987.22] stories. Your siblings need to hear those stories. Your parents and friends need to hear those stories.
[987.34 → 994.40] And so many psalms are psalms that simply remember and call to mind what God has done in the past as a way
[994.40 → 999.72] of saying, he did that then, and he can do it now. In church, he did these things then, and can do it
[999.72 → 1000.72] now.
[1000.72 → 1010.82] Let me finish with where the psalm finishes. With hope for peace. And I sometimes think when you read psalms
[1010.82 → 1014.96] in a situation where we have relative peace here in Canada, we don't have the states invading British
[1014.96 → 1022.32] Columbia. Hopefully, right? Just kidding. But for our brothers and sisters who have fled their homes for
[1022.32 → 1026.24] political disasters, for people in Ukraine who are fleeing their city because they've been bombed,
[1026.24 → 1033.62] these words are so potent. So I want to read them again. This is the final verses 9 and 10 of our
[1033.62 → 1041.68] psalm. He makes war cease to the ends of the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear. Furthermore, he burns the
[1041.68 → 1051.02] shield with fire. He says, be still and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations. I will be
[1051.02 → 1061.54] exalted in the earth. God's end goal has always been peace. From the very beginning, when humans
[1061.54 → 1066.50] rebelled against him and tried to be God rather than listen to God, his aim was reestablishing
[1066.50 → 1071.40] the shalom, the harmony, the beauty, and the goodness that was there at the creation of the
[1071.40 → 1080.84] world. God's long aim in the entire biblical story is reclaiming peace. And what the psalmist do is
[1080.84 → 1085.10] cling to that. What all the people and the prophets do is cling to that. It's that God will bring peace.
[1085.26 → 1090.10] And we trust him to be God. We trust him to do it in the way that he sees fit. But he will bring peace.
[1090.88 → 1095.50] And for the biblical writers, especially the prophets, that means that God will stand against
[1095.50 → 1101.12] oppression. He will deal with the injustice. He will stand up against the world leaders who oppose
[1101.12 → 1106.82] his good rule, and he will show them that he is God. And I often think of a writer named Miroslaw
[1106.82 → 1112.26] Wolf, who sort of takes on the challenge of like, wow, God is such a violent God. God has, you know,
[1112.30 → 1117.18] he goes to war. And Miroslaw Wolf has often said, he wouldn't be God if he couldn't stand against evil.
[1117.64 → 1123.14] Right? Why would you worship a God who's powerless in the face of genocide? Who's powerless in the face
[1123.14 → 1127.92] of Russia coming to Ukraine? We really wouldn't need to worship a God who can't do something about evil.
[1129.18 → 1133.50] What the psalmist wouldn't know, and the prophets later would not be able to anticipate,
[1133.50 → 1140.00] is the way God would establish that peace. Because it wasn't with military boots, it wasn't with
[1140.00 → 1146.80] spears, it wasn't with swords. It was with his son humiliated, naked, hanging on a cross in shame.
[1147.96 → 1154.26] That was God's means of establishing peace. It was his one and only son who was sent for the purpose
[1154.26 → 1159.94] of defeating the powers behind the empires. Defeating the powers and the principalities that
[1159.94 → 1165.84] operate behind all the evil, all the injustice, all the violence. In Christ's words, it is finished.
[1166.38 → 1170.96] We're God's declaration of victory over sin and hate and violence and oppression.
[1174.40 → 1179.52] A few months ago, I was reading Martin Luther King Jr. with our surge group. And if you're ever
[1179.52 → 1183.12] wondering if you're an eloquent preacher, just read Martin Luther King Jr. and your answer will be,
[1183.20 → 1188.50] no, I'm not an eloquent preacher. He's a very eloquent preacher. And he's something who knew about
[1188.50 → 1192.74] political turmoil. And you know Martin Luther King Jr.'s story of battling racism in the South.
[1193.68 → 1197.44] And I was struck again by his words of justice and the cross. Let me read for you. Actually,
[1197.50 → 1202.16] this is a reflection of his on the Psalms. This is a bit of an extended quote, but this is what he writes.
[1202.94 → 1208.84] Life constantly presents us with circumstances that are beyond our control. We are continually
[1208.84 → 1213.66] confronted with circumstances we did not have the freedom to choose, but with which we are forced
[1213.66 → 1220.32] to deal. At birth, African Americans are automatically thrust into a caste system they did not select.
[1221.00 → 1225.84] Other people, through no fault of their own, are forced to live life with an unwelcome and dreaded
[1225.84 → 1232.54] disease. In such intolerable circumstances, one of the great temptations of life is to become inward
[1232.54 → 1237.74] thinking. Ultimately, the test of a man's life is how he responds to his circumstances.
[1237.74 → 1246.86] It is necessary to look beyond our circumstances to something fixed, knowing that God's beautiful
[1246.86 → 1252.38] goodness will ultimately win over every state of evil. And this next quote is the singer.
[1253.68 → 1261.24] Evil may so shape events that Caesar will occupy a palace and Christ a cross. But that same Christ
[1261.24 → 1268.98] arose and split history into A.D. and B.C. so that even the life of Caesar must be dated by his name.
[1270.10 → 1276.18] Yes, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.
[1278.70 → 1285.16] Amen to that, hey? And it bends towards justice not on its own. It bends towards justice because God
[1285.16 → 1292.08] in Christ rules over his creation. It bends towards justice because God does not have his hands off
[1292.08 → 1297.02] the wheel. He's not on concerns about the wars of even our day. It bends towards justice because God
[1297.02 → 1303.62] will accomplish and establish his kingdom of peace. And the book of Revelation, especially Revelation 19,
[1303.90 → 1309.66] describes Jesus as the king who will return and all forces that oppose him, all armies that stand
[1309.66 → 1315.42] against his kingdom of peace will be overturned and done away with by Jesus, who will once and for all
[1315.42 → 1321.08] establish a kingdom of peace. And there will be no more bows, no more spears, no more nuclear warheads,
[1321.30 → 1328.22] because Jesus has done what God set out to do in Genesis. Establish a kingdom of peace forever.
[1328.40 → 1333.74] There will be no hate. There will be no violence. There will be no singing in subways, because the singing
[1333.74 → 1339.46] will be out loud in front, because Jesus' kingdom has come, and every knee has bowed before him.
[1339.66 → 1344.32] And those who love and serve him will enjoy that kingdom forever.
[1348.32 → 1355.26] And so the call to the church to hear Psalm 46 in our day, I think, is twofold. One is,
[1356.14 → 1364.92] we wait in hope for Jesus to return and bring that kingdom of peace. But two, we pray in trust
[1364.92 → 1371.34] that God will be God in our day, that his presence will be sufficient for our crises, and that he will
[1371.34 → 1376.84] show up to be our fortress, our deliverance, and our ever-present help in the midst of our troubles.
[1378.06 → 1385.70] And here's the hunch that I have on how this might be the most, how do I say this, what might be the most
[1385.70 → 1387.98] effective evangelism for the church right now?
[1389.42 → 1396.84] I think a posture of trust in the midst of crisis might be one of the most powerful statements of faith.
[1397.70 → 1401.18] And I say that recognizing, as you probably do, that we live in anxious times.
[1401.92 → 1407.64] There is a mood of anxiety that pervades our cities, it pervades our schools, it pervades our workplaces.
[1407.64 → 1414.30] There is an increased anxiety that is very confusing in many ways, given the incredible safety with which we live.
[1415.56 → 1419.54] And yet in the middle of the anxiety that circulates and is in our bones in our society,
[1419.74 → 1424.42] imagine there were believers who lived with a confident faith.
[1425.78 → 1429.38] That no matter what comes our way, no matter what mountains fall into the seas of our day,
[1429.60 → 1434.68] we trust, we live in faith, we trust that God will show up and be our fortress,
[1434.68 → 1440.56] and therefore we will not fear, for the mountain gives way and falls into the sea.
[1442.00 → 1446.08] Imagine what kind of questions would stir in your co-workers, your classmates, your friends,
[1446.22 → 1450.84] even your family members, as you live out your faith with that kind of confident trust that we see in Psalm 46.
[1451.24 → 1455.88] I'm sure living that out faithfully would stir a lot of conversation,
[1456.50 → 1460.46] especially when pandemics hit, when people's life is threatened by disease,
[1460.46 → 1464.80] when all sorts of pain are circulating in our cities, to see believers who say,
[1465.46 → 1466.98] we trust God even now.
[1467.82 → 1471.40] We hold faith before this huge God even now.
[1471.50 → 1477.28] We'll sing songs of faith even in the subway as the bombs fall on our city,
[1477.64 → 1478.98] because God is our refuge.
[1479.78 → 1480.54] He's our strength.
[1481.20 → 1483.08] He's our ever-present help in trouble.
[1483.52 → 1487.32] And we will be still and know that He is God.
[1487.78 → 1490.36] God Almighty is with us.
[1491.46 → 1492.18] Let's pray.
[1496.34 → 1498.52] Father, we give thanks for this psalm.
[1499.42 → 1503.46] We thank you for the way that you inspired people generations ago
[1503.46 → 1507.72] to put this on paper such that we can sing it to you today.
[1508.60 → 1513.36] And we thank you that you have already answered the great question of how you'll bring this peace,
[1513.42 → 1514.38] and we thank you for Jesus.
[1515.10 → 1518.62] We thank you that the tomb is empty and that Jesus sits on the throne.
[1518.62 → 1523.04] And we look forward and hope to the day when Jesus will establish that kingdom of peace,
[1523.40 → 1527.82] and all evil, injustice, violence, and pain will be done away with.
[1528.62 → 1532.52] And we pray with the church that suffers around the world, come soon, Lord Jesus.
[1532.52 → 1537.08] But we ask, too, that you would help us to wait in faith,
[1538.08 → 1541.56] that you would teach us to trust whatever calamities that come our way,
[1542.08 → 1545.58] that we would live not with fear, but with faith.
[1545.58 → 1547.68] And for that, Lord, we need your spirit.
[1547.78 → 1552.64] So fill us with your spirit and teach us to live in the way that we see in Psalm 46.
[1553.76 → 1554.04] Amen.
[1554.04 → 1560.50] Well, Jonathan picked a psalm of faith that has also led generations of people.
[1560.72 → 1562.36] That we're going to sing as a song of response,
[1562.50 → 1563.18] It Is Well.
[1563.32 → 1564.24] Let's stand as we sing.

[1684.22 → 1686.22] Let's stand as we sing.
[1686.22 → 1691.22] Let's stand as we sing.
[1691.22 → 1695.22] as a stone.
[1699.76 → 1701.22] The strong
[1702.22 → 1705.22] shall resound
[1705.22 → 1708.22] and the Lord
[1709.22 → 1711.22] shall resent

[1773.22 → 1774.22] His well
[1774.22 → 1775.22] with my soul
[1775.22 → 1778.72] In my soul.
[1782.56 → 1793.08] In his love, in his love, in his love.
[1793.08 → 1803.96] In his love, in his love.
[1805.22 → 1807.70] In my soul.
[1812.82 → 1813.34] Amen.
[1816.24 → 1820.16] We're going to go out into the city as people who trust in a faithful God.
[1820.70 → 1822.90] In a season of uncertainty and fear.
[1823.74 → 1825.84] As people who have to learn how to trust.
[1826.80 → 1830.10] But we go into the city with God's blessing, his presence and his protection.
[1830.32 → 1833.96] So I want you to receive a blessing that goes back generations as well.
[1833.96 → 1836.38] This is called the Aaronic Blessing.
[1836.44 → 1839.08] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[1839.78 → 1843.48] The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[1844.08 → 1850.18] The Lord turn his face towards you and give you his peace.
[1850.52 → 1851.34] And together we sing.
[1851.94 → 1852.38] Amen.
[1852.66 → 1853.78] Let's sing one more song.
