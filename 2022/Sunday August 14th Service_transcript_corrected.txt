[0.00 → 11.50] I couldn't help but notice as Nana prayed that a lot of her prayers were words from different
[11.50 → 16.24] psalms, which is precisely what we're going to focus our time on this morning. We're going to
[16.24 → 21.52] continue our series in the honest prayers of the psalms. And, you know, we've looked at psalms
[21.52 → 26.38] where God's people are asking for help in the midst of calamity, where they're wrestling with
[26.38 → 31.22] enemies and conflict, where they're wrestling with the shortness and the difficulty of life.
[31.82 → 36.66] And this morning we're looking at a very well-known psalm of confession. And I was actually going to
[36.66 → 42.66] preach on Psalm 51, the psalm of confession, last week. But I opted to preach it this week because
[42.66 → 47.30] we baptized little Timothy Huang last week, and it was a tough transition to go from baptizing a baby
[47.30 → 52.54] and all the celebration to like a psalm of confession about murder and adultery. But that's what we get
[52.54 → 58.36] to do this week. Yay. If you have your Bible, I do invite you to turn with me to Psalm 51.
[66.40 → 67.34] Psalm of David.
[68.82 → 76.94] Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love, according to your great compassion.
[76.94 → 87.36] Blot out my transgressions. Wash away my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions.
[88.10 → 96.50] My sin is always before me. Against you, you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight.
[97.46 → 103.16] So you're right in your verdict, and you justified when you judge. Surely I was sinful at birth,
[103.16 → 108.50] sinful from the time my mother conceived me. Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb.
[109.06 → 115.02] You taught me wisdom in that secret place. Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean.
[115.48 → 122.62] Wash me, and I'll be whiter than snow. Let me hear joy and gladness. Let the bones that you have crushed
[122.62 → 130.82] rejoice. Hide your face from my sins. Blot out my iniquity. Create in me a pure heart, O God,
[130.82 → 137.28] and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from
[137.28 → 143.50] me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me.
[144.94 → 151.22] Then I will teach transgressors your way, and sinners will turn back to you. Deliver me from blood guilt,
[151.22 → 158.02] O God, you who are my saviour, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness. Open my lips, Lord,
[158.02 → 164.48] and my mouth will declare your praise. You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it.
[165.48 → 173.10] You do not take pleasure in burnt offerings. My sacrifice, God, is a broken spirit, a broken
[173.10 → 180.84] and contrite heart you, God, will not despise. May it please you to prosper Zion, to build up the walls
[180.84 → 187.64] of Jerusalem. Then you will delight in sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offerings whole. Then bowls
[187.64 → 197.34] will be offered on your altar. I want to begin this morning with a question, and the question is,
[197.52 → 202.56] have you ever had a time when you were confronted, and you were exposed?
[204.84 → 210.24] Where someone said words that pierced you, and it hurt, and you did not want to deal with it?
[211.58 → 216.68] Perhaps it was a friend who showed a text, a deceitful text you sent that destroyed the life of somebody
[216.68 → 222.70] somebody else. Perhaps it's a parent who sets up a sit down with you because they saw something on the
[222.70 → 230.38] internet history that was deeply troubling. Perhaps it was a family member who hopes did a time to
[230.38 → 237.62] intervene your addiction. Perhaps it was a boss, an employer, who said it's time to talk about your
[237.62 → 241.04] work habits that are far less than desirable.
[243.48 → 246.80] Whatever situation you're imagining in your life where you were confronted
[246.80 → 251.58] and you were exposed, you know what it's like to have the option before you.
[252.30 → 259.14] You could, on the one hand, defer and deflect, to excuse, to mask it, or you can do the hard thing,
[259.14 → 267.68] that is to own it, to accept the rebuke for what it is, and that is a gift, to lead you into confession.
[269.80 → 276.60] You should know that Psalm 51 was written on the heels of King David, who wrote this psalm,
[277.08 → 283.80] being confronted and exposed. If you read the superscript, sort of the intro statement to this
[283.80 → 289.36] psalm, it gives you the whole context of why Psalm 51 was written. The superscript writes,
[289.86 → 296.42] for the director of music, a psalm of David, when the prophet Nathan came after David committed
[296.42 → 302.12] adultery with Bathsheba. And if you're not familiar with the Bible and the story of King David, I'll just
[302.12 → 308.04] briefly give you the thumbnail sketch. This comes from 2 Samuel 11 and 12. David, who is the king of
[308.04 → 313.40] Israel, interestingly, did not go to war with his people. They were at war. He stayed back. And on one of the
[313.40 → 317.86] nights while he was back, he was sitting on the roof, and he saw a woman bathing. Her name is Bathsheba.
[318.46 → 323.92] And David saw her beauty and decided he wanted to have that woman. So he invited her. He slept with
[323.92 → 329.28] her. She was married. And then he had to deal with the complexity of that. And so he hatched a plan
[329.28 → 336.10] to deal with what he had created here. And her husband's name was Uriah. And so he put Uriah in
[336.10 → 340.34] the front line of battle, in the battle he should himself have been in. And he wanted him to be in the
[340.34 → 344.62] front line so that Bathsheba's husband would be killed in battle and David could have Bathsheba
[344.62 → 349.46] to himself. This, by the way, if you ever think you have a dysfunctional, broken family, just read
[349.46 → 354.36] the story of David and Saul and Solomon. They are just as dysfunctional as the rest of us.
[355.54 → 360.28] And you can imagine, perhaps, that David along the way just kept rationalizing, kept minimizing,
[360.54 → 366.58] kept excusing all these awful decisions after awful decisions because he's the king. Perhaps he felt he
[366.58 → 371.58] deserved this. And perhaps he would have been stuck in this web of self-deception and lying if it weren't
[371.58 → 377.92] for the prophet Nathan, who God sent to David. Never minimize, by the way, when you get sent to be
[377.92 → 383.02] confronted. Perhaps it's God using that person. And he goes to David. He tells him this story of a corrupt,
[383.20 → 387.60] wealthy man who takes advantage of a poor man. And he's just pulling David into the story. And David's like,
[387.68 → 391.64] what an awful story. What kind of corrupt, wealthy man would do this? And Nathan says to him,
[391.64 → 397.42] David, you're that man. And this is what you've done to Uriah so that you could have Bathsheba as
[397.42 → 403.62] your wife. And now King David, the ruler of the people, a man with great power, being confronted
[403.62 → 411.02] by this bold prophet, now he's got the choice. Do I minimize, blame, deflect, or do I own it?
[412.48 → 419.84] In Psalm 51 is David saying, I'm going to own this one. This sin is my sin, and I'm taking it
[419.84 → 427.92] straight to God. Psalm 51 is called the great psalm of confession. It doesn't just talk about
[427.92 → 435.14] confession. Psalm 51 is David confessing. This is real-time confession. And these words, it is not
[435.14 → 439.90] an understatement to say, or an overstatement, that they have guided millions of Christians
[439.90 → 446.42] throughout the generations deal with the darkest parts of their life. The secret sin, the sexual sin
[446.42 → 452.88] that they don't want no one to know about. And it gives words to Christians to bring that dark stuff
[452.88 → 460.84] to God. And it helps them cling with David to the character of God, which is, as it starts, loving
[460.84 → 468.38] and compassionate. Asking that God could do what only God can do, and that is cleanse, forgive, and give
[468.38 → 478.30] broken, wrecked, sinful people new hearts. That's Psalm 51. Now, there are a lot of takes on the structure
[478.30 → 483.70] of Psalm 51, and I'm actually just going to focus on three elements, which I believe are the dominant
[483.70 → 489.28] elements of Psalm 51. The first is David honestly facing his sin. We're going to look at how he does
[489.28 → 496.38] that. Second is David asking, pleading with God to do what only God can do and to heal him. And the third
[496.38 → 503.22] is, an often neglected part of the Psalm, David moving to outward worship and to sharing and witnessing
[503.22 → 510.94] with others the power of God. Facing sin, inviting God to do what only God can do, and moving out to
[510.94 → 517.02] witnessing and sharing and declaring the healing, cleansing power of God. That's Psalm 51. That's where
[517.02 → 525.08] we're going to go this morning. So, to start, David is honest. He is honest about his sin. Listen to how it
[525.08 → 531.78] starts. The first verse is, have mercy on me. And then verse two, for I know my transgressions. My sin
[531.78 → 538.70] is always before me. Against you and only you have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight. So you are
[538.70 → 547.74] right in your verdict and justified when you judge. You know what these aren't? Those words are not words of
[547.74 → 554.10] someone who's playing games. And we can play games in our prayers. We can play games in our conversations.
[554.30 → 560.00] We can do what we're so good at doing when we are confronted and exposed. We can find some reason to
[560.00 → 565.70] blame something else. You have ever done that before? The reason I did that is not because of my sinful heart.
[565.78 → 571.04] It's because I've got a difficult marriage. It's because I've got challenging children. I don't sleep well.
[571.04 → 576.36] My boss is hard. I'm not having a good season. Right? You have ever done that before? Take that
[576.36 → 582.54] confrontation. Put it over there. Deflect and blame. Or we can minimize and mask it. We're all
[582.54 → 589.00] sexually broken. It was a moment of weakness. What do you expect of me under all the pressure I live
[589.00 → 595.32] with? Perhaps David even thought, as many men do when they commit adultery, she'd be better with me.
[595.32 → 602.14] I deserve this. I'll take better care of her. I'm the king. David does none of those things. Did you
[602.14 → 608.66] notice that? No self-defence. No deflecting. No masking. No minimizing. He's been exposed and he
[608.66 → 615.02] owns all of it. He knows what he's done. Furthermore, he knows the mess he's created, and he's going to God with honest
[615.02 → 622.20] self-reflection. Now David uses three words to describe his sin in this passage. He uses the word
[622.20 → 629.02] transgression, uses the word iniquity, and he uses the word sin. Now I don't think I hear people very
[629.02 → 634.32] often at all say the word transgression or iniquity. So I'm just going to describe what these three words
[634.32 → 639.64] mean so we can get some sense. Now transgression, you might guess, is sort of stepping out of a
[639.64 → 643.82] boundary. There are boundaries on how we live. There are boundaries on our relationships. And David's saying,
[643.92 → 649.28] I've transgressed. I've stepped so far beyond the boundary. That's what I've done. Secondly, iniquity,
[649.28 → 654.92] which is sort of the warped desires we're born with in our sin. That warped set of desires,
[655.02 → 659.06] that hatched plans like, oh I don't know, killing off a person on the front line of war so you can
[659.06 → 665.04] keep their wife for yourself. And then thirdly, it's sin. And sin is described in many ways, but it's
[665.04 → 671.00] the act of missing the mark. You know, there's God's design for your life right there, and you are way over
[671.00 → 677.04] there. And what I love about Psalm 51 is as David describes transgression, iniquity, and sin, he's like,
[677.04 → 682.84] check, check, check, check. All of the above. I'm guilty of it. I have transgressed the boundaries.
[682.98 → 689.74] I've killed a man so I can have his wife for myself. He is not minimizing. He's not blaming.
[690.24 → 695.42] He's recognizing that this situation is a mess of his making and he cannot fix it himself.
[695.42 → 705.28] Now here's a conviction I have. My conviction is that confession and repentance, like we see in Psalm 51,
[705.88 → 712.30] is a necessary piece of every Christian life. More than that, I think confession, if you practice it
[712.30 → 719.44] regularly, it's a sign of spiritual maturity. What do you think? I think people who confess are people
[719.44 → 725.64] who are finally learning to be honest with God about who they are. Finally learning to name what
[725.64 → 731.66] needs to be named. And I think this is just a hunch of mine. There is a desire in many Christians, an
[731.66 → 737.36] unhealthy desire to sort of leave alone, to put a lid on the brokenness, to not talk about the dark
[737.36 → 742.38] pieces of who we are with other believers or with God. And we just kind of secretly hope that goes away
[742.38 → 748.84] and we just secretly hope we grow. We have this sort of fake Christianity. And it breaks my heart
[748.84 → 754.82] that in so many churches, we know there's something wrong. I mean, even today, the stats on sexual sin
[754.82 → 759.58] in the church is staggering. Pornography addiction in the church is staggering. But we're not talking
[759.58 → 763.84] about it because we're afraid to. And we're afraid to pray about it because, well, for a lot of reasons.
[764.22 → 769.76] And I'll get to some of those in a minute. Confession is a sign of spiritual maturity where you're saying,
[769.76 → 774.18] I know the sin, Lord. I'm bringing it to you honestly.
[778.72 → 784.50] Nancy Lee Demons has written a book on brokenness and revival. She uses revival often to talk about
[784.50 → 789.86] spiritual renewal. But years ago when I read this book, it was suggested to me by a prof of mine.
[790.46 → 794.50] This line I underlined and have come back since reading it another time. She writes,
[794.50 → 804.04] We all want painless revival. A laughing revival. Resurrection. Life without crucifixion.
[804.56 → 810.64] Here's the turn. But the way up is down. Revivals do not begin happily. They begin with hearts
[810.64 → 818.00] that are broken. We will never meet God in revival, she'll add renewal, until we have first met him
[818.00 → 823.50] in brokenness. Now, how does that sit with you? Does that resonate with your experience?
[823.50 → 831.08] I read another book years ago on, I think I've shared about this before, on situations where
[831.08 → 835.54] there's major revivals, where many people come to faith in a city or a town or a place where there's
[835.54 → 839.72] sort of just this incredible growth in churches and conversion. And there's a group of people that
[839.72 → 844.02] years ago did a study on like, what's the connective tissue between these experiences? Like, what are the
[844.02 → 848.46] ingredients that lead to these revivals? And are there similarities? And one of the things they noted
[848.46 → 852.88] that was true of all the places they went to, where they studied and took testimony and listened to stories
[852.88 → 859.50] of revival. You know what it is? Repentance and confession. They found story after story where in
[859.50 → 863.26] a city where there's a revival and churches were growing and there's renewal, it was a group of
[863.26 → 868.52] people, often a small group of people, who were so sick of their sin, who were so broken by the needs
[868.52 → 873.90] of the city, they cry out to God and say, Lord, this is such a mess. We need you to show up and do
[873.90 → 881.50] something. And lo and behold, a God of compassion and love and power shows up in revival.
[883.22 → 887.82] But before we move to the next section, I need to pause and ask then the question, are we taking sin
[887.82 → 896.10] seriously in our lives? Is confession a practice in your home? Is it a practice in your prayers before
[896.10 → 903.10] you go to bed or when you wake up in the morning? Are you being honest with God about that stuff that
[903.10 → 910.62] you'd very much like to keep a nice sealed lid on? Because the way up is down and the way of renewal
[910.62 → 918.00] is by means of confession and repentance. And the church does not need any more masking or hiding
[918.00 → 922.52] or minimizing or deflecting the reality of our broken hearts.
[924.80 → 930.46] Second movement, after David is honest about his own heart, honest about his own sinful context,
[930.94 → 935.22] there is honest position. And I hope you just love this part of the passage because I certainly do.
[935.46 → 942.38] David makes massive requests to God, like just huge requests. You know, over and over again, he's saying,
[942.66 → 947.18] this is what I need, God. I need you to do it. Let me just read a few things that he says to the Lord
[947.18 → 952.12] in this prayer. Verse 2, wash away all my iniquity. That's a big request, don't you think?
[952.48 → 960.18] Cleanse me from my sin. Verse 10, create in me a new heart. Renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[960.50 → 968.56] Restore to me the joy of salvation. Again, remember what happened. Remember what Nathan convinced him of.
[968.82 → 974.64] And now he's saying, Lord, do all these things in my life. And let me name something very beautiful,
[974.64 → 980.10] and that is that David is not only looking for God to cover over and forgive what has already happened
[980.10 → 985.40] and all the mess it had created. He's not looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card or someone to finally say,
[985.52 → 988.62] it's good, we're done here. He's looking for transformation.
[989.58 → 994.14] David wants a new heart, new ambitions, new desires. He wants the miracle of transformation.
[994.56 → 997.52] Not just something that covers over what happened, he wants to be a new person.
[997.96 → 1001.26] That's how big his requests are to God. And I think that's beautiful.
[1001.26 → 1008.40] It's beautiful for a number of reasons, one of which is he believing that the God he prays to can actually do that.
[1010.00 → 1011.26] It's worth pausing and thinking about that.
[1011.70 → 1015.56] When David pens this confession, he really does believe that the God he worships,
[1015.62 → 1018.58] the God he leads under, the God who's leading his people,
[1018.84 → 1022.14] can forgive, cleanse, renew, and actually give people new hearts.
[1022.98 → 1023.68] That's something.
[1024.96 → 1027.72] And notice the way, how he starts this psalm.
[1027.72 → 1030.26] He clings to God's character.
[1030.98 → 1033.30] He frames his whole confession by saying first,
[1034.04 → 1038.64] have mercy on me according to your unfailing love and your great compassion.
[1039.62 → 1043.02] Even in the worst of his sin that got exposed in community,
[1043.16 → 1047.30] David is clinging to the fact that God is loving, and he is compassionate.
[1047.60 → 1051.66] And he will stake his life, his broken, shambled, sinful life,
[1051.66 → 1055.30] and ask God to be that for him at this moment of sin.
[1055.82 → 1056.52] That's beautiful.
[1059.80 → 1061.60] I would guess that there's many of us
[1061.60 → 1065.24] that would not be sure if we could pray this with integrity.
[1066.10 → 1068.94] And that is to say, I'm guessing there's a number of us, even here this morning,
[1069.64 → 1072.52] who have been stuck in ruts of sin and patterns of unfaithfulness
[1072.52 → 1074.80] and stuff we would never want to admit to anyone.
[1075.00 → 1076.52] And we've been stuck there for so long,
[1076.52 → 1079.76] we've come to believe the lie that we are far too far gone.
[1081.36 → 1083.00] That we're sort of unforgivable.
[1083.72 → 1084.50] It's too hard.
[1084.80 → 1085.74] It's too patterned.
[1085.80 → 1086.44] It's too deep.
[1086.64 → 1087.36] It's too painful.
[1087.54 → 1088.34] There's too much shame.
[1088.66 → 1090.80] And our shame and all the guilt around our sin
[1090.80 → 1092.62] has clouded our view of God's character.
[1093.92 → 1095.78] And one of the reasons we want to look at this psalm
[1095.78 → 1097.76] is because David, in his mess,
[1098.46 → 1100.60] finds the character of God and says,
[1100.70 → 1101.50] this is who you are.
[1101.68 → 1103.68] Be that for me at this moment.
[1103.68 → 1109.56] Now, if you read the story of 2 Samuel 11 and 12,
[1110.28 → 1112.84] you'll know that Nathan confronts David, and he says,
[1113.08 → 1113.72] this is your reality.
[1113.84 → 1114.36] You're the guy.
[1114.54 → 1115.34] This is what you've done.
[1115.80 → 1116.58] Plain and simple.
[1116.74 → 1117.12] Own it.
[1117.52 → 1118.86] And then he talks about the consequences.
[1119.04 → 1120.98] And there are consequences of what David has done.
[1121.04 → 1122.50] He loses his own son.
[1123.24 → 1126.10] But Nathan makes this curious statement that is worth saying.
[1126.20 → 1128.98] In his confrontation of David, he says,
[1129.46 → 1131.44] the Lord has taken away your sin.
[1131.44 → 1135.22] The Lord has taken away your sin.
[1136.12 → 1138.26] And that little phrase should cause us to pause.
[1138.90 → 1141.82] Because that is quite, you might say,
[1142.12 → 1144.12] a scandalous statement of grace.
[1145.48 → 1148.04] If you imagined yourself as Uriah's family,
[1148.66 → 1149.88] or even Bathsheba's family,
[1150.26 → 1152.02] you might be thinking, wait a minute.
[1152.82 → 1154.42] The Lord has taken away your sin?
[1154.70 → 1156.66] Do you know what David has done?
[1156.66 → 1162.94] There is a scandalous sense of grace emerging in this psalm and into David's life.
[1163.10 → 1164.90] Murder and adultery are on the table.
[1165.40 → 1167.52] And yet Nathan says, the Lord has taken away your sin.
[1170.32 → 1173.98] There's a powerful statement that's easily overlooked in Psalm 51,
[1174.12 → 1175.08] where David says,
[1176.68 → 1178.92] wash me with hyssop.
[1179.46 → 1181.54] Cleanse me with hyssop and I will be clean.
[1182.08 → 1183.06] And hyssop, just so you know,
[1183.10 → 1184.60] I did not know this until I was reading this.
[1184.60 → 1185.72] Hyssop is the branch.
[1185.82 → 1189.02] It's the plant they used to smear the blood on the doorways in Exodus.
[1189.66 → 1192.38] When God came in judgment in Egypt,
[1192.94 → 1193.86] and the people were told,
[1194.00 → 1195.20] if you put this on your doorway,
[1195.34 → 1196.64] you put that around your doorway,
[1196.80 → 1198.12] that judgment will pass over you.
[1199.90 → 1202.14] And David knows that God is right to judge.
[1202.18 → 1202.92] He says it right here.
[1203.00 → 1204.00] You are right in your verdict.
[1204.12 → 1205.26] You are right in your judgment.
[1205.42 → 1207.06] You are God, and I am not.
[1207.06 → 1210.42] And what David is going to learn in his life
[1210.42 → 1214.22] is that the judgment of God passes over him.
[1215.38 → 1218.12] The judgment of God passes over his children.
[1218.88 → 1220.32] And it passes over the prophets.
[1220.88 → 1222.98] And it lands, much to David's surprise,
[1223.42 → 1225.04] on his great, great-grandson.
[1226.16 → 1227.56] The judgment lands on Jesus.
[1229.54 → 1230.92] When I was preparing this passage,
[1230.92 → 1233.70] a verse from 1 Peter came to mind.
[1233.82 → 1235.44] 1 Peter is a loved book of mine.
[1235.56 → 1237.18] Once I had it memorized.
[1237.36 → 1237.92] Not anymore.
[1238.18 → 1239.48] That has faded since having kids.
[1240.14 → 1241.04] Along with many other things.
[1242.00 → 1242.98] But I want to read for you
[1242.98 → 1245.18] how 1 Peter describes Jesus' death.
[1246.20 → 1247.26] And it pulls in
[1247.26 → 1249.36] the Old Testament sense of God's judgment.
[1250.52 → 1250.78] It says,
[1250.78 → 1265.30] You hear that?
[1266.06 → 1269.28] You hear that?
[1269.28 → 1273.06] He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross
[1273.06 → 1275.44] so that we might die to sins
[1275.44 → 1277.54] and live to righteousness.
[1278.72 → 1280.38] Then you get my favourite verse.
[1280.78 → 1282.88] By his wounds,
[1283.46 → 1284.34] you have been healed.
[1286.00 → 1287.18] Are you hearing that
[1287.18 → 1289.30] in present tense for us today?
[1291.44 → 1293.30] God did that miracle for David.
[1294.22 → 1296.00] God finds sin egregious.
[1296.12 → 1297.56] It's not that this sin that David committed
[1297.56 → 1298.30] doesn't matter to him.
[1298.36 → 1299.60] It's not that it's some small thing
[1299.60 → 1300.74] that he can just look away from.
[1300.94 → 1301.72] God sees the sin.
[1301.78 → 1302.74] He sees all the sin.
[1302.80 → 1303.94] He sees all our sin.
[1304.18 → 1305.50] And in his infinite wisdom,
[1305.92 → 1306.76] grace, and love,
[1306.82 → 1307.20] he says,
[1307.48 → 1308.54] The judgment will come,
[1309.16 → 1310.34] but it won't fall on you.
[1311.22 → 1312.18] The judgment will come.
[1312.24 → 1313.32] It's not even going to fall on your children.
[1313.38 → 1315.46] The judgment will fall on Jesus Christ.
[1315.70 → 1317.30] The one who judges justly says,
[1317.50 → 1319.46] I will take that in Christ for you.
[1320.06 → 1321.10] And you, by Christ,
[1321.16 → 1322.08] will die to sin.
[1322.14 → 1323.20] You will die with Jesus,
[1323.30 → 1325.60] and you will rise in his life.
[1327.28 → 1328.16] Praise be the Lord.
[1328.16 → 1330.34] God has done that miracle,
[1330.34 → 1331.18] not just for David,
[1331.80 → 1333.68] but for everyone who finds himself
[1333.68 → 1335.78] wrapped in a mess of sin of their own making,
[1335.96 → 1336.88] crying out to God,
[1336.96 → 1337.12] saying,
[1337.20 → 1338.04] You're the just judge.
[1338.36 → 1338.84] Cleanse me.
[1338.96 → 1339.38] Renew me.
[1339.48 → 1340.18] Give me a new heart.
[1340.22 → 1340.70] And God says,
[1341.06 → 1342.42] Yes, I will.
[1343.14 → 1345.42] And it comes through the cross of Christ.
[1346.22 → 1347.64] It comes through that being the time
[1347.64 → 1348.04] where Jesus,
[1348.36 → 1350.34] God deals with sin once and for all,
[1350.84 → 1352.26] burying it in the grave with Jesus,
[1352.98 → 1354.30] coming up in resurrection life,
[1354.30 → 1354.72] and saying,
[1355.06 → 1356.14] That's for you to have.
[1356.76 → 1358.92] You can now live as you were created to live.
[1359.42 → 1361.46] You can now live by the Spirit's power
[1361.46 → 1362.60] within the boundaries
[1362.60 → 1363.92] you were created to live and thrive.
[1364.34 → 1367.82] You can resist the power of sin.
[1368.68 → 1369.34] Did you hear that?
[1370.14 → 1371.96] You, by the work of the Spirit
[1371.96 → 1373.28] and the resurrection life of Jesus,
[1373.40 → 1375.78] can resist the power of sin.
[1377.12 → 1378.48] God gives us new hearts.
[1378.48 → 1386.12] Now we get to the third movement of Psalm 51.
[1386.32 → 1387.36] David owns his sin.
[1387.42 → 1388.26] He names the reality.
[1388.40 → 1390.38] He calls on God to do what only God can do,
[1390.52 → 1392.68] the cleansing, renewing, healing power.
[1393.16 → 1395.56] And now he turns his heart outwards.
[1395.80 → 1396.78] Very important movement.
[1397.96 → 1400.00] He doesn't just want himself to experience cleansing.
[1400.08 → 1401.44] He wants to tell other people about it.
[1401.48 → 1402.30] Let me read for you
[1402.30 → 1404.56] what David says in verse 13 and 15.
[1405.64 → 1406.08] He says,
[1406.08 → 1409.14] Then I will teach transgressors your way.
[1409.74 → 1411.14] Or, I put this in my language,
[1411.40 → 1412.34] I'll teach my own people.
[1412.90 → 1413.56] He's one of them.
[1413.90 → 1415.36] And sinners will turn back to you.
[1415.48 → 1416.88] Open my lips, Lord,
[1417.00 → 1420.16] and my mouth will declare your praise.
[1421.10 → 1422.56] David doesn't want to just experience
[1422.56 → 1423.82] the cleansing work of God himself.
[1424.06 → 1425.40] He doesn't just want his sins covered over.
[1425.48 → 1428.58] He wants other people to have what he experienced.
[1429.04 → 1430.62] He wants other people to taste
[1430.62 → 1432.62] the new, renewing power of God.
[1432.82 → 1433.36] Isn't that beautiful?
[1434.24 → 1435.36] That's ministry right there.
[1436.08 → 1437.20] I think the most effective,
[1437.62 → 1438.26] faithful ministry
[1438.26 → 1439.78] is inviting other people
[1439.78 → 1440.30] to experience
[1440.30 → 1441.86] what you have already experienced yourself.
[1442.38 → 1443.04] You want to know grace?
[1443.12 → 1444.20] Let me tell you how I've experienced it.
[1444.24 → 1445.72] You want me to talk about
[1445.72 → 1446.52] the transformation of Jesus?
[1446.74 → 1448.24] This is how I'm experiencing it.
[1448.84 → 1449.74] In fact, Henry Owen,
[1450.64 → 1451.74] who's written a well-known book
[1451.74 → 1452.62] called The Wounded Healer,
[1453.38 → 1455.10] talks about how your place
[1455.10 → 1456.20] of greatest ministry
[1456.20 → 1458.60] will probably be the place
[1458.60 → 1459.90] of your greatest pain
[1459.90 → 1461.70] and weakness and brokenness
[1461.70 → 1462.96] that Jesus Christ
[1462.96 → 1464.12] is slowly bringing healing
[1464.12 → 1464.94] and renewal to.
[1465.78 → 1466.82] And as he does that,
[1466.86 → 1467.88] as he transforms you,
[1467.96 → 1469.42] as he moves his spirit in you,
[1469.46 → 1470.10] as he brings you
[1470.10 → 1471.44] to a place of faithfulness
[1471.44 → 1472.26] and renewal,
[1472.54 → 1473.76] you then invite other people
[1473.76 → 1474.56] into that place
[1474.56 → 1475.84] as you've experienced it.
[1476.48 → 1477.14] Where your ministry
[1477.14 → 1478.48] is sort of a come and see
[1478.48 → 1479.68] what God is doing here.
[1479.74 → 1480.62] Not that you're perfect,
[1480.96 → 1481.74] no one gets there,
[1481.90 → 1483.40] but as you experience that renewal,
[1483.48 → 1483.68] you say,
[1483.84 → 1484.82] look what God is doing in me
[1484.82 → 1486.10] and he can do that for you.
[1487.10 → 1487.34] Right?
[1488.16 → 1488.78] That's why,
[1488.86 → 1489.62] this is just an example
[1489.62 → 1490.10] in our own church,
[1490.20 → 1490.90] Nell Vulcanizer,
[1491.14 → 1492.08] a number of years ago,
[1492.20 → 1492.50] now you,
[1492.58 → 1493.48] I see you in the back there,
[1494.00 → 1495.16] Nell was diagnosed with cancer
[1495.16 → 1495.92] a number of years ago.
[1496.50 → 1497.54] And that was a hard season,
[1497.70 → 1498.66] and Nell's in another hard season
[1498.66 → 1499.54] with her husband's health.
[1499.92 → 1500.92] But when she was diagnosed
[1500.92 → 1501.36] with cancer,
[1501.44 → 1502.16] we were praying for her,
[1502.24 → 1502.94] and Nell went through
[1502.94 → 1503.70] that dark valley.
[1503.86 → 1504.22] And then,
[1505.04 → 1506.06] not that long after,
[1506.32 → 1506.64] Tammy,
[1507.30 → 1507.98] whose husband's sitting
[1507.98 → 1508.48] right beside Nell,
[1508.56 → 1509.24] Tammy was diagnosed
[1509.24 → 1509.80] with cancer,
[1509.90 → 1511.14] and guess who ministered
[1511.14 → 1511.56] to Tammy?
[1512.70 → 1513.14] Nell did.
[1513.82 → 1514.22] She was there
[1514.22 → 1515.08] every step of the way,
[1515.08 → 1516.86] holding on to the character
[1516.86 → 1517.30] of God,
[1517.46 → 1518.42] praying through fear,
[1518.56 → 1519.32] praying through the fear
[1519.32 → 1519.68] of death,
[1519.70 → 1520.20] and the two of them
[1520.20 → 1520.90] became bonded.
[1521.38 → 1522.34] This is the same thing
[1522.34 → 1522.78] with AA.
[1523.22 → 1524.36] The model of AA is,
[1524.66 → 1525.68] I used to be an alcoholic,
[1526.08 → 1526.92] and now I've been free
[1526.92 → 1527.64] for this many days,
[1527.68 → 1528.32] and I want to walk
[1528.32 → 1529.20] beside the person
[1529.20 → 1530.42] who can't go home
[1530.42 → 1531.02] by themselves
[1531.02 → 1531.96] because they will grab
[1531.96 → 1532.60] the alcohol,
[1533.24 → 1534.20] the wounded healer.
[1534.76 → 1536.26] The person who's experiencing
[1536.26 → 1537.92] the renewing power of God
[1537.92 → 1538.42] and saying,
[1538.42 → 1539.68] let me share with you
[1539.68 → 1541.06] that God can heal me
[1541.06 → 1541.98] and he can heal you.
[1542.76 → 1543.50] He can heal
[1543.50 → 1545.34] the greedy person.
[1546.10 → 1547.48] He can heal the alcoholic.
[1547.94 → 1549.08] He can heal the porn addict.
[1549.22 → 1549.80] He can heal
[1549.80 → 1550.58] the lazy,
[1550.76 → 1552.06] corner-cutting employee.
[1552.76 → 1553.58] He can heal me.
[1554.30 → 1555.04] He can heal you.
[1556.56 → 1557.46] That's the ministry
[1557.46 → 1558.20] of the church.
[1558.84 → 1559.94] And it gets me excited
[1559.94 → 1560.66] in my imagination
[1560.66 → 1561.26] to think,
[1561.60 → 1562.76] what if evangelism,
[1563.28 → 1563.76] think about this,
[1563.80 → 1565.02] what if evangelism was that?
[1566.12 → 1566.78] What if it wasn't
[1566.78 → 1567.80] like a ninja chop
[1567.80 → 1568.44] where you talk about
[1568.44 → 1569.46] Jesus dying for sins
[1569.46 → 1570.18] and you can get away
[1570.18 → 1570.62] from hell
[1570.62 → 1571.32] if you believe in Jesus?
[1571.42 → 1572.10] What if we moved away
[1572.10 → 1573.64] from the ninja chop evangelism?
[1574.16 → 1574.88] That's a surge.
[1575.02 → 1575.54] Someone in surge
[1575.54 → 1576.40] came up with that phrase.
[1576.48 → 1577.02] It wasn't mine.
[1577.58 → 1578.16] Towards saying,
[1578.30 → 1578.50] hey,
[1579.28 → 1580.22] God's bringing healing
[1580.22 → 1580.96] into my life
[1580.96 → 1582.16] and this is something
[1582.16 → 1582.94] that I've struggled with
[1582.94 → 1583.54] for years
[1583.54 → 1585.06] and in my prayer life
[1585.06 → 1585.84] and in community
[1585.84 → 1586.68] with my small group,
[1586.76 → 1588.16] I'm experiencing transformation.
[1588.70 → 1590.20] I'm moving towards renewal
[1590.20 → 1591.36] and the way I've been created
[1591.36 → 1591.76] to live.
[1592.52 → 1593.98] How could that be your story?
[1595.08 → 1596.68] How might you want healing?
[1597.52 → 1598.64] Where could the renewal
[1598.64 → 1599.90] of Jesus Christ
[1599.90 → 1600.64] through his death
[1600.64 → 1601.14] and resurrection
[1601.14 → 1602.34] break into your life
[1602.34 → 1602.94] and make you
[1602.94 → 1604.78] who God created you to be?
[1605.26 → 1606.06] Doesn't that sound
[1606.06 → 1606.94] like evangelism
[1606.94 → 1607.92] that's compelling?
[1609.02 → 1609.80] In a broken,
[1610.22 → 1610.70] anxious,
[1611.10 → 1613.06] lost city like ours?
[1616.20 → 1617.26] I want to finish
[1617.26 → 1618.34] with a couple questions.
[1620.84 → 1622.82] Where does this psalm meet you?
[1623.84 → 1625.46] This is a very personal psalm
[1625.46 → 1626.80] and we get to listen in
[1626.80 → 1627.86] on David's confession.
[1627.86 → 1630.90] It's our children.
[1633.32 → 1634.14] They're fleeing
[1634.14 → 1635.68] from one cornerstone room
[1635.68 → 1636.08] to the other.
[1638.98 → 1640.04] I'll just wait a sec.
[1644.66 → 1646.12] I'm genuinely curious
[1646.12 → 1649.10] how Psalm 51
[1649.10 → 1650.52] interacts with our lives.
[1652.40 → 1653.68] I'm genuinely curious
[1653.68 → 1655.28] how it percolates
[1655.28 → 1655.72] in your heart
[1655.72 → 1656.38] and maybe you're new
[1656.38 → 1657.00] to Christianity.
[1658.10 → 1659.06] Maybe Psalm 51
[1659.06 → 1659.52] is like,
[1659.66 → 1659.88] wow,
[1660.14 → 1660.56] confession,
[1660.72 → 1661.38] what is this?
[1662.14 → 1663.16] It's a bit overwhelming.
[1663.30 → 1664.24] How do I talk to God
[1664.24 → 1665.12] about these broken pieces
[1665.12 → 1665.60] of my life?
[1665.66 → 1666.24] And Psalm 51,
[1666.36 → 1666.66] if you're new
[1666.66 → 1667.42] to the Christian faith,
[1667.72 → 1668.30] is an invitation
[1668.30 → 1669.64] to this new practice.
[1671.96 → 1672.36] Perhaps
[1672.36 → 1674.24] you've been in a season
[1674.24 → 1675.38] where you are so busy
[1675.38 → 1676.22] casting stones
[1676.22 → 1676.88] at other people.
[1677.38 → 1678.14] You've been so busy
[1678.14 → 1678.84] blaming people
[1678.84 → 1679.90] for things that are going wrong.
[1680.06 → 1681.14] You have not had
[1681.14 → 1682.12] a season of humble
[1682.12 → 1683.38] confession yourself.
[1683.38 → 1684.16] And Psalm 51
[1684.16 → 1684.80] is an invitation
[1684.80 → 1686.70] to do this thing,
[1687.44 → 1688.46] to be contrite,
[1688.58 → 1689.12] to be humble,
[1689.24 → 1690.22] to be brokenhearted
[1690.22 → 1691.56] before your Heavenly Father.
[1693.66 → 1694.18] Perhaps
[1694.18 → 1695.60] this Psalm
[1695.60 → 1696.40] just straight up
[1696.40 → 1697.12] convicts you.
[1698.54 → 1699.44] Perhaps there are patterns
[1699.44 → 1700.00] of sin,
[1700.16 → 1700.94] relational sin,
[1701.20 → 1701.98] sexual sin,
[1702.22 → 1703.02] addictive tendencies
[1703.02 → 1703.72] that the Psalm
[1703.72 → 1704.86] just surfaces right away
[1704.86 → 1705.42] in your imagination.
[1705.98 → 1706.82] And you feel the shame
[1706.82 → 1707.74] even percolating now
[1707.74 → 1708.34] as I speak.
[1708.76 → 1709.26] This Psalm
[1709.26 → 1710.00] is an invitation
[1710.00 → 1711.56] to experience
[1711.56 → 1712.56] the liberating power
[1712.56 → 1713.08] of Jesus
[1713.08 → 1714.46] through the practice
[1714.46 → 1715.06] of confession
[1715.06 → 1715.68] and repentance.
[1717.28 → 1717.90] Psalm 51
[1717.90 → 1718.60] is a gift
[1718.60 → 1719.30] to the church.
[1720.24 → 1721.18] And I was going to
[1721.18 → 1722.20] just have a short prayer
[1722.20 → 1722.76] but I've decided
[1722.76 → 1723.90] I want to finish my prayer
[1723.90 → 1725.14] as we prepare
[1725.14 → 1725.70] for communion.
[1726.44 → 1727.44] I want to just lead
[1727.44 → 1727.86] a prayer
[1727.86 → 1729.04] through Psalm 51.
[1729.18 → 1729.84] I'm taking this
[1729.84 → 1730.66] from a prayer
[1730.66 → 1731.74] by a woman named
[1731.74 → 1732.38] Amy Loving
[1732.38 → 1733.34] which is an amazing
[1733.34 → 1733.94] last name.
[1734.88 → 1735.92] And it's an adaptation
[1735.92 → 1736.88] of Psalm 51
[1736.88 → 1737.68] and I'm going to read
[1737.68 → 1738.60] some portions of it
[1738.60 → 1739.64] on behalf of us.
[1739.76 → 1740.38] I'm going to lead times
[1740.38 → 1740.96] for silence
[1740.96 → 1741.66] where we can pray.
[1742.40 → 1743.22] And I do invite you
[1743.22 → 1744.44] to just listen
[1744.44 → 1745.02] to the Spirit.
[1746.44 → 1747.18] Whatever convictions
[1747.18 → 1747.68] you might have
[1747.68 → 1748.56] bring those to the Father
[1748.56 → 1750.36] and then after we pray
[1750.36 → 1751.84] after I finish our prayer
[1751.84 → 1752.56] we're going to go
[1752.56 → 1753.52] to the table of grace
[1753.52 → 1753.88] together
[1753.88 → 1754.90] and receive the love
[1754.90 → 1755.36] of Christ
[1755.36 → 1756.00] through the meal
[1756.00 → 1756.44] of communion.
[1756.64 → 1758.24] So join me
[1758.24 → 1758.76] in prayer.
