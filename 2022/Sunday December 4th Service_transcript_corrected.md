[0.00 → 9.52] As you can see, it is the season of Advent.
[10.58 → 15.10] And this season, we often say that we look back on the birth of Jesus,
[15.34 → 20.90] the first coming of Jesus, as a way of training us to wait for the second coming of Jesus.
[21.40 → 25.32] And He is coming, so we are living in our own season of Advent, waiting.
[26.10 → 29.32] As you can see, we're looking at the names of Jesus in Isaiah 9,
[29.32 → 33.44] the prophecy spoken about the coming King who would be the Wonderful Counsellor,
[33.54 → 37.64] the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace.
[38.50 → 42.40] Last week, Jonathan looked at what does it mean for Christ to be our Wonderful Counsellor.
[42.46 → 46.46] And this morning, we're going to open up together what it means for Jesus to be our Mighty God.
[47.28 → 49.62] And Alvin, I just want to say thank you for reading our Scripture.
[50.52 → 55.50] I said this in the 9 a.m., I'll say it again now, that it is a beautiful and a powerful thing
[55.50 → 57.62] that when you hear the Scripture read in different languages,
[57.62 → 62.58] you realize that God speaks, and He reveals Himself in every one of our languages.
[63.58 → 69.14] That's a beautiful thing, that God speaks and reveals Himself in every one of our languages.
[72.28 → 74.02] I'm going to begin this morning with a story.
[75.14 → 78.22] It's a story about a young guy at the back of a bus.
[79.70 → 84.46] Three men get on this bus, and this is in the 1930s, by the way, in downtown Detroit.
[84.46 → 88.26] These three men get on the bus, they pay their fare, and they sit in the middle of the bus,
[88.34 → 92.46] and they look back, and they see a young African-American man sitting by himself at the back.
[93.08 → 95.52] And these three young guys decided they're going to tease him.
[95.94 → 98.68] And so they start calling names back, they start saying things to him,
[98.98 → 101.14] and he doesn't respond even in a little bit.
[101.86 → 104.78] And so they turn up the heat, they start saying a little more aggressive things,
[104.92 → 107.40] more insulting things, hoping to maybe get a Mile out of him,
[107.48 → 109.80] maybe get a fight going, just to see what happens.
[109.80 → 111.12] He gives them nothing.
[112.32 → 116.02] A few minutes later, the bus stops, this man stands up to get off,
[116.10 → 120.72] and they realize that this guy's a lot bigger than they thought when they were making fun of him.
[121.26 → 125.52] And as he walks by them to get off the bus, he hands one of them a business card.
[126.08 → 128.90] Gets off the bus, one of the men looks at the business card,
[129.00 → 130.90] and no joke, what is written on there is,
[131.30 → 133.82] Joe Lewis, professional boxer.
[133.82 → 136.32] This is a true story.
[137.46 → 144.12] Those three young men tried to pick a fight with the person who would become the world heavyweight champion for more than a decade.
[145.16 → 149.52] How lucky they must have felt that he did not respond.
[150.24 → 153.32] They had no idea the power they were messing with.
[155.24 → 160.60] When Isaiah prophesies about a coming king, about a son that is given to the world,
[160.60 → 164.74] one of the words used to describe that son is mighty God.
[165.34 → 169.76] In Hebrew, that word is El Gabor, and El Gabor has a wide range of meanings,
[169.90 → 176.36] including warrior, strong fighter, hero, and champion.
[178.24 → 180.80] Jesus, mighty God.
[181.72 → 184.74] And there will come a day, Isaiah is already prophesying,
[184.88 → 189.56] where there will be powers and principalities and forces of darkness that mock this coming king,
[189.56 → 195.56] and we'll learn that they have no power against this mighty God.
[198.02 → 200.72] Now, it's helpful to remember that when we look at Isaiah 9,
[201.16 → 204.10] we're reading not just comfortable words given to comfortable people,
[204.20 → 208.20] that these, in my opinion, are audacious words of prophecy.
[208.30 → 210.98] They are scandalous, in my opinion.
[211.54 → 212.84] And here's why they're scandalous.
[212.84 → 217.48] The four words used to describe this coming son that's going to be given
[217.48 → 223.20] are four words, as commentators point out, that are used to describe exclusively only God.
[224.14 → 228.92] And Isaiah is saying these words are describing a coming child.
[230.02 → 231.88] That's a scandalous claim.
[232.68 → 235.28] And commentators will point out, as they look at Isaiah 9,
[235.52 → 239.56] that there is no other religion that would speak of a child in these ways.
[239.56 → 241.08] God is up there.
[241.18 → 241.84] He's infinite.
[242.20 → 243.00] We are down here.
[243.10 → 243.72] We are finite.
[243.84 → 247.10] And there's no way you can speak of a child in God terms.
[248.02 → 252.10] But Isaiah, scandalously and audaciously, is saying,
[252.24 → 253.78] if you want to know what God is like,
[254.12 → 255.84] if you want to know the character of God,
[256.24 → 259.02] this child that's coming is going to reveal Him to you.
[260.40 → 262.26] That's a scandalous claim, don't you think?
[262.26 → 267.00] And we can get so comfortable sort of in the Advent traditions in the West
[267.00 → 272.26] that we kind of forget how powerful and significant these prophecies are.
[272.46 → 275.52] Isaiah is making the boldest claims about a coming king
[275.52 → 281.90] who is going to be the fullest revelation of the wisdom, the peace, and the might of God.
[284.36 → 286.52] Now, Pastor Jonathan pointed this out last week,
[286.54 → 288.18] and I'm just going to highlight briefly again
[288.18 → 291.56] the context that these words of prophecy are spoken to.
[291.56 → 293.74] They're not prophesied to people living in comfort.
[293.98 → 294.74] Quite the opposite.
[295.66 → 298.44] Isaiah prophesied this to people living in fear.
[299.06 → 301.66] It's actually fitting that Sandy was talking about the war in Ukraine
[301.66 → 305.04] because Israel, receiving this prophecy from Isaiah,
[305.38 → 308.80] were living in a time when this giant world empire named Assyria
[308.80 → 311.48] was on the move across their cities,
[311.60 → 313.40] taking city by city,
[313.70 → 315.34] showing their power, showing their force,
[315.64 → 318.00] bringing Israel into submission to the Assyrian rule.
[318.00 → 320.98] And where Isaiah is prophesying in his city,
[321.32 → 323.00] they hadn't yet been captured or defeated.
[323.12 → 325.90] They were still living in relative safely, but they were worried.
[326.66 → 329.52] They were worried that they were next, that war was coming their way,
[329.58 → 330.26] and they were wondering,
[330.60 → 332.04] what's going to happen to us?
[332.08 → 332.94] Will we be safe?
[333.02 → 333.80] Will we be protected?
[334.00 → 334.94] And even more deeply,
[335.86 → 337.40] will God take care of us?
[337.98 → 339.40] Will God remember us?
[339.74 → 342.42] Will He provide for us as this giant world empire
[342.42 → 345.74] sweeps through our cities in power and military force?
[345.74 → 347.86] That's the context of Isaiah 9.
[349.04 → 350.48] And into that fear,
[351.28 → 355.26] Isaiah speaks some punchy, powerful words of hope.
[356.42 → 358.64] In general, what Isaiah is saying to them is,
[358.98 → 359.96] God has not forgotten.
[360.90 → 362.54] God has not neglected you.
[362.64 → 365.18] He's not asleep at the wheel and forgetting what His plans are.
[365.24 → 366.72] He's accomplishing His purposes.
[367.24 → 368.48] He's working out His will,
[368.76 → 371.32] but you're going to have to wait.
[372.48 → 374.18] And if you don't already know this about the Scriptures,
[374.18 → 375.26] I'll just give it to you straight.
[375.66 → 380.86] So much of the experience of God's people in the Bible is waiting.
[381.94 → 384.60] They wait, and they wait, and they wait.
[384.64 → 385.42] And don't get this wrong.
[385.56 → 387.32] God shows up throughout the story,
[387.36 → 388.44] and He accomplishes His purposes,
[388.88 → 393.24] but God's people are people who have to learn how to wait.
[394.22 → 395.48] And that's true, by the way,
[395.50 → 397.32] and I'll come back to this, about the church today.
[397.42 → 399.60] We need to be a people who learn how to wait,
[399.60 → 402.26] that the God who is in control of this world,
[402.78 → 406.70] accomplishing His purposes, does it in His time.
[407.68 → 409.58] And what Isaiah is saying in this prophecy is,
[409.88 → 412.46] Israel, I know you're afraid, but don't worry.
[413.14 → 415.34] The God who rules the world is sending a child,
[415.48 → 418.38] and His government will be reigning peace over the creation.
[418.50 → 419.54] That's what Isaiah 9 says.
[420.36 → 421.44] Take hope, Israel.
[421.84 → 425.08] The King that's coming is going to establish justice and mercy.
[425.58 → 426.14] Wait for Him.
[427.00 → 427.94] Take hope, Israel.
[428.18 → 430.82] The King that's coming, the child that's going to be given to you,
[430.96 → 434.26] will be a wonderful counsellor, a mighty God,
[434.68 → 436.76] an everlasting Father, and a Prince of Peace.
[437.42 → 438.40] Wait for Him.
[439.56 → 440.30] And guess what they did?
[441.84 → 442.62] They waited.
[443.78 → 446.24] Years turned into decades, decades turned into centuries,
[446.24 → 448.04] and four centuries later,
[448.68 → 451.00] in a little town of Nowhereville,
[451.12 → 453.36] to two people without power, privilege, or title,
[453.36 → 457.08] comes this child named Jesus, born in a barn.
[458.38 → 459.86] And that's the child.
[460.78 → 463.32] Centuries of waiting produced.
[464.88 → 468.50] Now, last week, Jonathan opened up the way in which Jesus is the wonderful counsellor.
[468.78 → 471.34] He reflects the wise counsel of the Father.
[471.40 → 473.86] And this morning, I'm going to open up what it means for Jesus,
[474.36 → 476.80] this Christ child, to be mighty God.
[476.80 → 481.16] How is Jesus mighty God?
[482.16 → 486.48] And I want to focus our attention on one dimension of Jesus' ministry,
[486.60 → 489.86] and that is His healing and His miracles.
[491.76 → 495.00] Think for a moment about the different things that Jesus does in His ministry.
[496.06 → 497.90] For starters, Jesus is in the boat.
[498.48 → 500.40] Water is swelling up, swamping the boat,
[500.46 → 502.22] and He extends His arm over the water,
[502.36 → 504.38] and it goes immediately calm.
[504.38 → 508.60] And that's not just a show you how powerful I am story.
[508.72 → 514.48] It's Jesus demonstrating the mighty power He has over creation,
[515.20 → 516.48] over natural disasters.
[517.68 → 521.12] Think of Jesus seeing a leper whose skin is falling off his body,
[521.24 → 521.90] losing his senses.
[522.20 → 524.78] He touches the leper, and his skin is made whole.
[525.52 → 526.66] And in and through that miracle,
[526.82 → 529.76] Jesus is demonstrating and displaying His might
[529.76 → 534.12] and His power over human disease and our bodily health.
[535.34 → 537.38] Or Jesus teaching on the mountainside,
[537.44 → 539.32] and there are thousands of people who are getting hungry.
[539.40 → 541.22] He takes this little meal from one boy,
[541.48 → 545.46] and He shows that He has power to feed thousands of people,
[546.22 → 550.10] demonstrating His ability to overcome our material needs
[550.10 → 551.74] and our physical needs.
[551.74 → 556.24] Or think of Jesus seeing a sick girl who died.
[557.20 → 560.02] And He goes to her, and He raises her back to life,
[560.22 → 563.82] demonstrating God's power over death.
[565.16 → 566.54] He is the mighty God.
[567.76 → 569.90] And maybe one of my favourite stories is hard to say,
[570.38 → 572.82] but a miracle story that I love, which is a two-for-one,
[573.40 → 574.70] comes in Mark chapter 2.
[575.58 → 577.54] And the story is Jesus teaching in a house.
[577.64 → 578.52] The walls are packed.
[578.52 → 581.20] The room is packed wall-to-wall with people listening to Jesus
[581.20 → 582.02] teaching about the kingdom.
[582.26 → 585.56] But there's a man outside who is paralyzed and can't walk.
[585.62 → 586.22] He's on a mat.
[586.44 → 590.56] And he's got four amazing, dedicated, creative, and bold friends
[590.56 → 593.00] who say, we're going to rip a hole through the roof
[593.00 → 595.22] and lower this man down in front of Jesus.
[595.70 → 596.66] Some of you know this story.
[597.50 → 599.10] And this man gets lowered in front of Jesus,
[599.20 → 601.52] in front of this, I'm sure, stunned, silent crowd.
[601.70 → 603.38] And what's the first thing Jesus says to him?
[604.42 → 604.84] Anyone know?
[604.84 → 609.36] Son, your sins are forgiven.
[610.84 → 613.02] And I, you know, there's no verse in the Bible about this,
[613.14 → 614.68] but I have this hunch that when that happened,
[614.76 → 618.06] the man was like, great, can we talk about my legs?
[618.44 → 619.34] They don't work.
[619.68 → 620.82] And I've been lowered down here
[620.82 → 622.16] because I want my legs to be healed.
[622.22 → 623.24] And what does Jesus do next?
[624.04 → 626.36] He says to him, take up your mat and walk.
[627.92 → 631.04] And in that scene, Jesus gets in hot water,
[631.20 → 633.14] not for the healing of his physical body.
[633.14 → 635.10] He gets in hot water with the Pharisees who say,
[635.68 → 638.80] who can do the forgiveness of sins except for God?
[639.68 → 641.82] And Jesus in this double two for one is showing,
[641.98 → 643.72] I don't just have power to heal the body.
[644.00 → 648.58] I have the mighty power to pronounce forgiveness over your sins
[648.58 → 651.20] and restore your relationship with my heavenly Father.
[651.52 → 653.52] I am the mighty God.
[654.88 → 655.66] That's Jesus.
[656.78 → 658.24] And the beauty and the mystery
[658.24 → 661.52] and the thing we marvel at Advent after Advent
[661.52 → 663.44] is as Dietrich Bonhoeffer puts it,
[663.64 → 666.68] that this manger is not just a manger that holds a human child.
[666.98 → 669.92] It is God in the manger.
[671.48 → 673.44] God is in the manger.
[673.88 → 677.00] And our Father in heaven was not just on board
[677.00 → 679.22] with this child being God.
[679.58 → 682.46] God was pleased, as Colossians 119 puts it,
[682.60 → 686.00] He's pleased to have His fullness dwell in that child.
[686.00 → 689.76] And for that child to grow up and reveal the fullness of the might
[689.76 → 693.00] and the power and strength of what it means to be God.
[693.66 → 694.70] Fully human.
[695.54 → 696.34] Fully God.
[698.56 → 700.44] And then there comes the moment,
[701.68 → 704.12] the climactic moment in all history
[704.12 → 707.10] where I imagine all creation holding its breath and waiting
[707.10 → 711.80] because Jesus then displays the full force.
[711.80 → 715.18] He flexes the full might of His divine power.
[716.14 → 716.68] And guess what?
[717.84 → 719.78] Isaiah also prophesies about that.
[721.00 → 723.16] Isaiah 9, he prophesies about a coming child
[723.16 → 725.18] who will be given, who will reign, a kingdom of peace.
[725.34 → 726.78] And then we get to Isaiah 53,
[726.90 → 730.30] and we learn that this mighty God is also a suffering servant.
[731.12 → 734.34] That this man who's going to usher in a kingdom of peace
[734.34 → 737.68] is also going to be crushed for our iniquities.
[737.68 → 740.94] He's going to be wounded for our sins.
[741.46 → 743.68] He's going to be pierced for our transgressions.
[745.24 → 749.04] And we learn that the cradle leads to the cross,
[749.44 → 752.26] that this son that is given will be the slain lamb.
[755.22 → 756.28] That moment came.
[757.66 → 758.66] And if you grew up in the church
[758.66 → 759.56] and you've been part of our church,
[759.62 → 762.76] you'll know that the moment that defines all history
[762.76 → 767.08] is where Jesus, you might say, steps into the ring.
[767.86 → 769.58] And He goes to war.
[769.88 → 772.02] And He becomes the hero and the champion
[772.02 → 774.74] who does what He was sent to do from the very beginning.
[775.66 → 777.74] Just like the boxer Joe Lewis
[777.74 → 781.08] did not worry himself with men picking on Him on the bus,
[781.08 → 783.92] but He saves His might and His strength and His energy
[783.92 → 786.38] for the day that came where He stood face-to-face,
[786.74 → 789.36] toe-to-toe, with the undefeated world champion,
[789.36 → 792.50] and He knocked Him down in two minutes of boxing.
[792.64 → 796.96] So Jesus saves Himself for the war that was set for Him,
[797.62 → 799.42] where He goes toe-to-toe
[799.42 → 802.30] with the undefeated enemies of sin,
[803.14 → 805.20] of death, and of Satan.
[806.32 → 810.98] And Jesus shows just how strong and powerful and mighty He is
[810.98 → 815.36] as He allows Himself not to be saved by legions of angels,
[815.46 → 817.12] but He allows Himself to be crucified.
[817.12 → 820.46] And through the cross, take on those enemies,
[821.10 → 822.54] drag them to the grave,
[822.78 → 824.58] exhaust them of all their power,
[824.90 → 826.10] and leave them there.
[827.44 → 829.56] And Jesus, the warrior hero,
[830.50 → 833.36] the mighty God, rises from that grave.
[835.12 → 837.94] The King, the mighty God,
[838.94 → 841.84] our warrior who wins our battle.
[841.84 → 845.66] This is the point where you say amen.
[846.94 → 847.98] You're getting there, hope.
[849.02 → 851.62] Our Nigerian brothers in the 9 a.m. were helping us along.
[853.22 → 855.64] And when Jesus wins that victory,
[856.24 → 859.16] when He KO's the enemies of sin, Satan, and death,
[859.44 → 861.58] we share in that victory.
[861.72 → 863.12] We are not just participants watching.
[863.44 → 864.86] We are people to whom Jesus says,
[865.20 → 867.26] share in the resurrection life that I give you.
[867.26 → 872.50] Celebrate the gift of freedom from sin that I freely offer to those who believe.
[872.90 → 876.62] Receive the gift of salvation from the mighty God
[876.62 → 878.50] who has now defeated your enemies.
[879.00 → 879.90] It's for you to share.
[881.24 → 883.54] We participate in His victory.
[883.54 → 887.02] But now we get to our Advent hope
[887.02 → 888.48] and our Advent waiting.
[889.64 → 891.16] One of the strange things you should know
[891.16 → 892.02] about the early believers,
[892.22 → 894.28] how they had to process what Jesus had done,
[894.74 → 897.28] is that before His ascension and after He rose from the dead,
[897.34 → 898.22] He's ministering to them.
[898.32 → 899.46] They looked around and Caesar,
[899.62 → 901.54] this corrupt, violent leader, was still on the throne.
[902.42 → 904.24] Roman soldiers still occupied the streets.
[904.36 → 906.42] People, friends, neighbours still died and fought
[906.42 → 907.20] and there was violence.
[907.50 → 908.90] And they wondered what was going on.
[908.94 → 911.24] If Jesus defeated death, and He's right there
[911.24 → 913.32] in His resurrected body to prove His victory,
[913.54 → 915.18] if He had done that, what's going on?
[915.20 → 916.92] And Jesus' response to them was,
[917.64 → 918.82] I have won the victory,
[919.64 → 922.92] but you will wait to experience the fullness of it.
[924.16 → 925.08] And that is to say,
[925.14 → 927.24] we live in this what's called already and not yet.
[928.06 → 929.96] We taste already the victory of the resurrection
[929.96 → 931.16] as we're renewed in Jesus,
[931.48 → 934.04] but we know that there's still sickness and pain and misery.
[934.90 → 936.44] And Jesus says, don't you worry.
[937.08 → 938.34] I'm coming again.
[939.74 → 940.60] Wait for me.
[940.60 → 943.86] And here's where we join all of our brothers and sisters
[943.86 → 946.84] in the biblical story, and we wait in hope.
[947.48 → 950.36] But our waiting is not for a little baby born in a manger.
[951.18 → 953.16] Our waiting is for a warrior king
[953.16 → 955.18] who already ascended to heaven,
[955.68 → 957.28] already rules over creation,
[957.28 → 961.22] and will come back to fully eradicate all sin,
[961.38 → 963.34] all disease, all violence, all war,
[963.48 → 964.72] all power of oppression.
[964.72 → 968.46] And on that day, we will celebrate.
[969.54 → 972.28] We will taste the fullness of the victory of Jesus Christ,
[972.74 → 974.72] crowned in authority and glory.
[976.08 → 977.52] That's our Advent hope.
[978.28 → 980.92] And that's what's sealed by the work of our mighty God
[980.92 → 982.60] who went to war for us.
[983.72 → 985.02] And so hope, I'll finish with a phrase
[985.02 → 987.02] we repeated last year in Advent.
[987.18 → 988.06] Christ has come.
[989.62 → 990.70] Christ has conquered.
[990.70 → 994.36] And Christ, our King, is coming again.
[995.50 → 995.82] Amen.
[996.10 → 996.48] Let's pray.
[1001.88 → 1003.92] Father, we thank you for sending your Son.
[1006.10 → 1010.22] And for the way you delighted in giving Christ all authority.
[1011.70 → 1014.62] We thank you for the way Jesus went to war for us
[1014.62 → 1017.16] and demonstrated what it is to be mighty.
[1017.16 → 1020.02] demonstrating for us what it means to exercise
[1020.02 → 1021.72] the fullness of his divine power.
[1022.72 → 1024.82] We thank you that the tomb is empty.
[1026.32 → 1028.66] Would you, Lord, teach us to wait?
[1029.84 → 1033.08] Would you teach us to place our hope in your coming?
[1034.08 → 1035.74] And would you make us faithful
[1035.74 → 1038.26] in sharing the victory of Jesus
[1038.26 → 1042.02] and making known the victory of Jesus until that day?
[1043.18 → 1044.58] To that end, would you fill us
[1044.58 → 1045.74] with the power of the resurrection
[1045.74 → 1046.92] through the Holy Spirit
[1046.92 → 1049.46] and send us into our cities
[1049.46 → 1050.48] with that good news.
[1051.48 → 1051.72] Amen.
