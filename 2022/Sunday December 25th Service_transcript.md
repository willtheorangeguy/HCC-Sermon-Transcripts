[0.00 --> 2.94]  Good morning and Merry Christmas to you all.
[6.38 --> 18.44]  It's wonderful to gather together on this Christmas morning and kind of unusual since often this only happens when Christmas lands on the Sunday.
[18.44 --> 25.84]  We usually just have Christmas Eve, so this is kind of a seven-year thing, so we'll call it a sabbatical Christmas. How's that?
[25.84 --> 34.98]  As you've kind of gotten the flavor of, we've been looking at the names of Jesus that are found in Isaiah.
[35.56 --> 41.06]  We've been doing that for our Advent season, that season where we prepare our hearts for the coming of Christ.
[41.44 --> 45.58]  Let me read you the passage once more, if you haven't heard it enough.
[46.04 --> 51.74]  For some of you, maybe this is going to be the first time you hear it, but it's a beautiful passage out of the Old Testament book of Isaiah.
[52.02 --> 52.78]  And we read this,
[52.78 --> 65.28]  For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders, and he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[65.98 --> 68.76]  Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end.
[69.36 --> 77.28]  He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing it and holding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever.
[77.28 --> 81.80]  And the zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
[83.16 --> 88.96]  And these names were given to this future Messiah, this future king.
[90.30 --> 93.46]  In a sense, they probably didn't really know what they were talking about.
[93.70 --> 95.84]  They just had this hope of this future king.
[95.84 --> 103.40]  But today, and we know that that's Jesus looking back, but today I'd like to reflect on the name of Jesus.
[103.92 --> 105.22]  On his name.
[105.36 --> 110.32]  All these references to Jesus are beautiful, but let's talk about his name this Christmas morning.
[111.52 --> 114.48]  That name is used nearly 1,200 times in the New Testament.
[115.36 --> 116.00]  It's Jesus.
[116.86 --> 117.28]  Yeshua.
[118.02 --> 120.60]  We get our name Joshua from that Hebrew word.
[120.60 --> 121.92]  And it means this.
[122.04 --> 124.30]  It means the Lord saves.
[125.28 --> 126.86]  The Lord saves.
[127.28 --> 132.64]  When I was reading that Isaiah 9 passage, it says the zeal of the Lord will accomplish this.
[132.98 --> 134.06]  The Lord saves.
[134.14 --> 135.02]  The zeal of the Lord.
[135.14 --> 138.10]  The will of the Lord will make this happen.
[140.88 --> 142.34]  It's a fairly common name.
[143.06 --> 148.02]  But it is loaded with meaning for us in our context and in the context of human history.
[148.02 --> 153.64]  I was thinking of Joseph when I reflect on this during this time of Advent.
[153.98 --> 157.68]  When Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant, he wasn't the father.
[157.80 --> 159.58]  He was going to quietly divorce her.
[160.54 --> 164.56]  And then we read, and Dave read this last night at our Christmas Eve service.
[164.90 --> 165.64]  I was a little nervous.
[165.78 --> 167.16]  I thought, oh man, I don't know what he's preaching on.
[167.20 --> 168.88]  Maybe I'm going to preach on the exact same thing.
[169.00 --> 173.54]  But anyways, we managed to navigate each other all by accident.
[173.54 --> 181.42]  Matthew 1, we read this after Joseph had this plan to be kind and divorce her quietly.
[181.96 --> 182.50]  We read this.
[182.58 --> 186.38]  But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and it said,
[186.52 --> 190.74]  Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take Mary home as your wife.
[191.02 --> 193.92]  Because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[194.42 --> 199.12]  She'll give birth to a son and you are to give him the name Jesus.
[199.12 --> 203.56]  Because he will save his people from their sins.
[204.94 --> 208.36]  In scriptures, names are often significant and prophetic.
[209.28 --> 210.36]  That's the case here too.
[210.80 --> 219.10]  This baby inside of Mary's wound would someday die and save mankind from sin and death because God saves.
[219.88 --> 221.42]  And I want to hit that home today.
[221.56 --> 222.40]  God saves.
[222.70 --> 226.32]  Many times in the Bible, we read also of Jesus Christ.
[226.54 --> 227.52]  It's not a last name.
[227.52 --> 233.62]  We should be saying Jesus who is the Christ, meaning Messiah or anointed one.
[234.26 --> 241.26]  So God saves and Jesus, the anointed one, the promised one, the Messiah of the line of David,
[241.74 --> 244.62]  he is the way God saves.
[245.50 --> 249.74]  And this leads us to reflect on the significance of his name, Jesus.
[250.18 --> 251.04]  God saves.
[251.04 --> 253.32]  And then how do we respond to that?
[253.44 --> 262.14]  Because Christmas can become a bit of a practice that we do every year without really thinking about it.
[262.16 --> 263.68]  I want to really dwell on it this morning.
[264.84 --> 268.16]  That this is about what God has done.
[270.02 --> 271.42]  What God has done.
[271.42 --> 274.64]  It's not about our journey to heaven, but about heaven coming down.
[274.92 --> 282.50]  It's not about building an award-winning church in response, but welcoming Jesus into our midst and our lives,
[282.78 --> 285.04]  and then reflecting who he is, the way we live.
[285.60 --> 288.22]  Salvation belongs to God alone.
[288.22 --> 290.22]  Joseph's story.
[290.22 --> 290.48]  Joseph's story.
[290.48 --> 291.86]  I just try to picture him.
[291.96 --> 298.04]  Joseph's story reminds us we are not the orchestrators of our own rescue or circumstances.
[298.70 --> 302.18]  And if we're honest, we really don't know what's going on.
[302.76 --> 303.66]  Like Joseph.
[304.72 --> 307.92]  He hasn't a clue what's really going on here.
[307.92 --> 312.94]  And the angel didn't say to him, here's what God wants.
[313.12 --> 314.36]  Here's the plan, Joseph.
[314.46 --> 315.96]  So go make it happen.
[316.24 --> 316.72]  No, no, no, no.
[317.10 --> 319.42]  Here's what God made happen.
[319.78 --> 321.98]  And here's what we want you to do, Joseph.
[321.98 --> 324.92]  We want you to learn to live in that reality and that truth.
[325.12 --> 327.68]  And you simply declare Jesus.
[328.94 --> 330.34]  God saves.
[331.24 --> 332.10]  That's your job.
[332.66 --> 333.88]  Declare Jesus.
[336.12 --> 337.56]  Toss out your plan.
[337.92 --> 339.84]  Which was going to end in divorce.
[340.96 --> 343.48]  And follow my plans, says God.
[344.58 --> 346.36]  His life was getting complicated.
[346.48 --> 347.36]  Maybe you can relate.
[347.62 --> 348.84]  He was feeling overwhelmed.
[348.94 --> 349.78]  Maybe you can relate.
[350.30 --> 353.42]  His soon-to-be wife seemingly had betrayed him.
[353.76 --> 355.02]  And God says, you know what?
[355.04 --> 357.78]  It's time to expand your definition of reality.
[358.20 --> 361.12]  This child, who is a problem to you,
[361.70 --> 364.76]  this child is the promised one.
[364.76 --> 366.68]  He is Jesus.
[367.92 --> 369.04]  God saves.
[369.68 --> 372.22]  And he has come for all of creation and all of mankind.
[373.38 --> 374.92]  And so Joseph does just that.
[375.28 --> 376.64]  We read it here in Matthew 1.
[377.20 --> 379.84]  He declares the child's name is Jesus.
[380.26 --> 382.46]  He says, God saves.
[382.46 --> 387.18]  That's what we're to respond to.
[387.42 --> 391.72]  And later on, then when he has to take his family and flee King Herod's death threats,
[391.78 --> 394.00]  because that's part of the Christmas story we don't talk about often,
[394.44 --> 396.34]  he declares, I picture this now,
[396.58 --> 398.74]  he declares every time he says that name,
[399.10 --> 400.28]  Jesus, get over here.
[400.44 --> 400.90]  All right, right.
[401.06 --> 401.62]  God saves.
[402.34 --> 404.16]  Jesus, you know, clean up your room.
[404.40 --> 404.84]  All right, right.
[404.92 --> 405.46]  God saves.
[406.02 --> 406.16]  Right?
[406.16 --> 409.92]  You know, every time he uses the name, he's saying God saves.
[410.12 --> 412.12]  And I think we need to remind ourselves of that too.
[412.18 --> 415.38]  We use the name Jesus, but we can use it without thinking.
[415.78 --> 419.82]  We are reminded again and again and again, God saves.
[421.50 --> 422.16]  God saves.
[422.46 --> 424.14]  In Joseph, we see our smallness.
[424.14 --> 426.34]  And remember, salvation belongs to God,
[426.54 --> 428.44]  even in the midst of all our struggles,
[428.78 --> 430.00]  in the midst of all the problems,
[430.10 --> 431.66]  no matter what they be,
[432.10 --> 433.36]  God saves.
[436.60 --> 438.56]  And the events of Christ's birth
[438.56 --> 441.56]  contain all the other events of Jesus' life.
[441.94 --> 443.52]  Bundled together in the manger
[443.52 --> 445.20]  is the salvation of the world,
[445.44 --> 446.44]  the cross, the resurrection,
[446.60 --> 447.32]  the coming of the Holy Spirit,
[447.40 --> 447.82]  the ascension.
[448.12 --> 451.00]  All are implicitly present in baby Jesus.
[451.56 --> 452.68]  In a real sense,
[452.68 --> 454.32]  the incarnation, Christ's birth,
[454.68 --> 456.96]  is our saving moment.
[458.16 --> 459.24]  It's our saving moment.
[459.54 --> 461.36]  God saves me
[461.36 --> 463.90]  because Christ came at Christmas.
[464.66 --> 465.86]  And we can then say,
[466.12 --> 467.00]  with old Simeon,
[467.36 --> 469.22]  there's an old man who's sitting in the temple
[469.22 --> 471.20]  who was promised that he would see the Messiah
[471.20 --> 472.08]  before he died,
[472.34 --> 473.92]  and Jesus comes a little later,
[474.30 --> 475.54]  and he says this,
[475.60 --> 475.84]  he says,
[475.90 --> 477.64]  for my eyes have seen your salvation.
[478.00 --> 480.04]  He sees that God saves.
[481.24 --> 482.42]  I read this quote.
[483.54 --> 484.28]  We say this,
[485.06 --> 485.76]  not because,
[485.96 --> 486.82]  and hopefully it's up there,
[486.88 --> 487.24]  there we go.
[487.78 --> 488.18]  We say this,
[488.24 --> 490.94]  not because we are looking backward
[490.94 --> 492.64]  from the cross to the crib,
[492.72 --> 494.48]  but also because from the very beginning,
[494.82 --> 496.02]  even before Adam fell,
[496.42 --> 497.54]  God was looking forward
[497.54 --> 498.80]  through the crib to the cross.
[499.68 --> 502.38]  This has always been about what God has done.
[502.74 --> 504.40]  Jesus, God saves.
[505.14 --> 506.62]  That's what we're celebrating today,
[506.62 --> 508.04]  and every day.
[508.04 --> 510.12]  This is not a seasonal moment.
[510.70 --> 513.28]  Often we tend to love Christmas
[513.28 --> 516.24]  because we say Christmas brings out the best in us.
[516.80 --> 518.28]  Have you ever heard stuff like that?
[518.94 --> 520.50]  That Christmas brings out the best in us.
[520.84 --> 521.00]  You know,
[521.06 --> 522.56]  I think of the story of The Christmas Carol.
[522.64 --> 522.78]  I mean,
[522.84 --> 524.58]  my favorite Christmas movie,
[524.78 --> 525.82]  everybody has their opinions,
[526.64 --> 528.08]  and Die Hard is not a Christmas movie,
[528.20 --> 528.46]  but anyway,
[528.50 --> 529.08]  that's another matter.
[529.08 --> 532.74]  But I say that,
[533.04 --> 533.22]  you know,
[533.28 --> 535.10]  my favorite is The Christmas Carol,
[535.32 --> 537.84]  but it has to be the Alistair Sims version.
[538.66 --> 539.98]  I watched one the other day,
[540.00 --> 540.60]  and it was a musical,
[540.76 --> 541.84]  and it was not right.
[541.94 --> 542.58]  It was wrong.
[542.82 --> 542.94]  So,
[543.12 --> 546.02]  but that story is saying
[546.02 --> 548.54]  that even Ebenezer Scrooge becomes a giver.
[548.94 --> 550.14]  And that's not,
[550.64 --> 552.16]  I'm not saying that's all bad,
[552.16 --> 553.68]  but I think The Christmas Carol
[553.68 --> 557.42]  has taken our Christmas story
[557.42 --> 559.54]  and tried to transform it
[559.54 --> 562.18]  into the way we view our Christmases today.
[562.76 --> 567.18]  Luke's story tells of God's gift to us,
[567.66 --> 570.74]  whereas Dickens tells how we can give to others.
[572.02 --> 575.42]  It helps us focus on improving our images.
[577.82 --> 579.22]  Yet God saves.
[579.82 --> 580.86]  In other words,
[581.58 --> 582.02]  you,
[582.76 --> 583.32]  me,
[583.90 --> 584.88]  we need saving.
[587.42 --> 588.98]  We need saving.
[593.42 --> 594.28]  You know what?
[594.36 --> 596.26]  I think we are better givers than getters,
[596.38 --> 596.94]  most of us.
[597.98 --> 600.74]  Not because we are particularly generous people,
[601.06 --> 602.78]  but because often we are a proud,
[603.06 --> 603.74]  arrogant people
[603.74 --> 605.04]  in need of saving,
[605.18 --> 606.32]  but not wanting to admit it.
[608.84 --> 610.58]  And that's a tough combination.
[611.92 --> 613.06]  In Luke's story,
[613.18 --> 615.52]  it isn't about how blessed it is to be givers,
[615.52 --> 618.96]  but how essential it is to see ourselves as receivers.
[620.08 --> 623.26]  This day says you need Christ.
[625.62 --> 628.04]  We prefer to think of ourselves as givers,
[628.26 --> 630.88]  powerful, competent, self-sufficient, capable people,
[631.04 --> 632.72]  whose goodness motivates us
[632.72 --> 634.64]  to use some of our resources
[634.64 --> 636.86]  for the benefit of the less fortunate.
[636.86 --> 639.58]  And the gospel is going to great length
[639.58 --> 641.60]  to show us the opposite is true.
[641.96 --> 645.72]  Jesus came without any help from us
[645.72 --> 647.40]  because no one understood the plan,
[647.72 --> 650.44]  and it is through him that God saves us
[650.44 --> 652.24]  and thus transforms us
[652.24 --> 653.82]  and all things.
[653.82 --> 659.30]  I like how John says it in his gospel,
[659.48 --> 660.16]  in John 1,
[661.60 --> 663.06]  this is out of the New King James Version.
[664.18 --> 664.74]  John writes,
[664.84 --> 666.04]  In the beginning was the Word,
[666.14 --> 667.56]  the Word was with God,
[667.64 --> 668.78]  the Word was God,
[669.26 --> 671.10]  and this Word is Jesus, by the way.
[671.38 --> 673.66]  He was in the beginning with God,
[673.92 --> 674.72]  creation of all things.
[675.04 --> 676.42]  All things were made through him.
[676.46 --> 678.20]  Without him, nothing was made that was made.
[678.54 --> 679.64]  In him was life,
[679.64 --> 681.78]  and life was the light of men.
[681.78 --> 683.64]  And the light shines in the darkness,
[683.76 --> 684.26]  and here we go.
[684.54 --> 686.96]  The darkness did not comprehend it.
[687.30 --> 689.66]  No one understood this.
[693.14 --> 694.70]  We didn't think of it,
[695.10 --> 695.88]  approve of it,
[695.94 --> 698.74]  or even comprehend it.
[699.62 --> 700.60]  Just like Joseph.
[702.14 --> 704.72]  All we could do was receive it.
[706.14 --> 708.00]  This is so counter-cultural
[708.00 --> 709.20]  to the notion,
[709.58 --> 710.30]  and here's the notion
[710.30 --> 711.34]  that our culture often has.
[711.34 --> 713.10]  You have within you
[713.10 --> 715.36]  the solution to what ails you.
[715.78 --> 716.40]  And the answer is,
[716.72 --> 718.70]  no, you don't.
[721.74 --> 722.78]  No, you don't.
[723.58 --> 724.66]  Our society says,
[724.96 --> 725.86]  you define you,
[726.16 --> 727.46]  you improve you.
[727.78 --> 729.30]  And the gospel says it clearly,
[729.82 --> 730.96]  God saves you
[730.96 --> 732.54]  because you need saving,
[732.66 --> 734.38]  and you can't do it.
[734.38 --> 741.82]  This strange story tells us
[741.82 --> 743.08]  we have to be receivers
[743.08 --> 744.34]  before we can even learn
[744.34 --> 746.00]  and be empowered to be givers.
[746.56 --> 747.66]  Discipleship teaches us
[747.66 --> 749.46]  the art of seeing our lives
[749.46 --> 749.94]  as gifts
[749.94 --> 751.16]  only after we've received.
[751.42 --> 752.64]  We talk a great deal
[752.64 --> 753.12]  in our world
[753.12 --> 754.28]  about freedom of choice
[754.28 --> 755.38]  and self-determination,
[755.38 --> 756.72]  but not too much
[756.72 --> 757.38]  about indebtedness
[757.38 --> 759.06]  and neediness.
[763.52 --> 764.84]  I think you might agree with me.
[765.14 --> 765.98]  It can be tough
[765.98 --> 767.38]  to be on the receiving end
[767.38 --> 769.36]  of giving,
[769.60 --> 770.04]  of getting.
[771.50 --> 772.24]  How many of you
[772.24 --> 772.96]  would rather be
[772.96 --> 774.58]  givers than receivers?
[774.58 --> 774.90]  Yeah.
[778.56 --> 779.80]  There's some power in giving.
[782.70 --> 783.66]  Being the receivers
[783.66 --> 785.62]  is the honest way
[785.62 --> 786.24]  we ought to be.
[786.70 --> 787.40]  I was thinking of
[787.40 --> 788.66]  the Isaiah 9 piece,
[788.74 --> 789.22]  Wonderful Counselor,
[789.26 --> 789.60]  Mighty God,
[789.84 --> 790.78]  and I was looking back
[790.78 --> 791.50]  prior to it,
[791.66 --> 792.54]  Isaiah 7,
[792.98 --> 793.70]  and I'm going to read
[793.70 --> 794.90]  a little bit of it to you.
[795.86 --> 797.30]  But here's the king,
[797.96 --> 798.24]  right?
[798.74 --> 799.86]  And there's trouble.
[800.40 --> 801.52]  They're under attack.
[802.14 --> 803.12]  And we read this.
[803.44 --> 804.34]  Isaiah's talking
[804.34 --> 806.68]  to King Ahaz.
[807.42 --> 808.36]  Let me read it to you.
[808.40 --> 809.28]  Again, the Lord spoke
[809.28 --> 809.96]  to Ahaz,
[810.38 --> 811.98]  Ask the Lord your God
[811.98 --> 812.68]  for a sign,
[813.04 --> 814.56]  whether in the deepest depths
[814.56 --> 815.68]  or the highest heights.
[816.12 --> 816.78]  In other words,
[816.96 --> 818.30]  you need help.
[819.14 --> 820.08]  You need help.
[820.08 --> 820.88]  Okay, now what?
[821.34 --> 822.84]  But Ahaz says,
[823.18 --> 823.66]  I will not,
[823.68 --> 824.78]  I will not put the Lord
[824.78 --> 825.24]  to the test.
[825.40 --> 826.08]  And we get this
[826.08 --> 827.10]  false humility
[827.10 --> 827.88]  going on here.
[828.14 --> 829.86]  I will stay in charge.
[831.04 --> 832.02]  I will stay in charge.
[832.40 --> 833.32]  And then Isaiah said,
[833.32 --> 834.00]  Here now,
[834.50 --> 836.28]  house of David,
[836.40 --> 837.12]  is it not enough
[837.12 --> 838.02]  to try the patience
[838.02 --> 838.48]  of humans?
[838.76 --> 839.96]  Will you try the patience
[839.96 --> 840.72]  of God also?
[841.20 --> 842.32]  Therefore the Lord himself
[842.32 --> 843.42]  will give you a sign.
[843.48 --> 844.02]  Here's the sign.
[844.38 --> 845.52]  The sign will be
[845.52 --> 846.14]  that the virgin
[846.14 --> 846.74]  will conceive
[846.74 --> 847.96]  and give birth to a son
[847.96 --> 849.20]  and will call him Emmanuel,
[849.54 --> 850.52]  God with us.
[850.72 --> 852.22]  This baby is the sign.
[852.42 --> 853.00]  You thought of that?
[853.10 --> 854.22]  No, you had no clue.
[854.48 --> 855.62]  You want to surrender to it?
[855.72 --> 856.60]  That's going to be hard
[856.60 --> 857.46]  because you want
[857.46 --> 858.28]  to stay in charge.
[863.06 --> 864.12]  Isaiah's been pleading
[864.12 --> 864.80]  with King Ahaz
[864.80 --> 865.54]  to put his trust
[865.54 --> 866.40]  in God's promises
[866.40 --> 867.96]  rather than in the alliances
[867.96 --> 869.22]  with strong military powers
[869.22 --> 870.12]  around like Syria.
[872.38 --> 873.32]  That's hard for us
[873.32 --> 873.98]  as human beings,
[874.04 --> 874.34]  isn't it?
[876.16 --> 877.28]  Christmas demands
[877.28 --> 878.06]  your surrender.
[878.06 --> 884.08]  I read this quote
[884.08 --> 884.76]  from Will Willimon.
[885.86 --> 886.16]  He said,
[886.24 --> 887.18]  this is often the way
[887.18 --> 888.12]  God loves us.
[889.06 --> 889.88]  Hear me carefully here.
[890.32 --> 891.58]  With gifts we didn't
[891.58 --> 892.62]  even know we needed,
[893.54 --> 895.26]  which transforms us
[895.26 --> 895.76]  into people
[895.76 --> 896.78]  we don't necessarily
[896.78 --> 897.38]  want to be.
[900.82 --> 902.82]  With our advanced degrees
[902.82 --> 903.34]  and armies
[903.34 --> 904.28]  and government programs
[904.28 --> 905.14]  and material comforts
[905.14 --> 906.34]  and self-fulfillment techniques,
[906.58 --> 907.82]  we assume that religion
[907.82 --> 908.90]  is about giving
[908.90 --> 909.98]  a little of our power
[909.98 --> 910.74]  in order to confirm
[910.74 --> 911.24]  to ourselves
[911.24 --> 912.32]  that we are indeed
[912.32 --> 913.22]  as self-sufficient
[913.22 --> 914.32]  as we claim.
[917.88 --> 919.10]  And God calls us
[919.10 --> 919.92]  to see ourselves
[919.92 --> 920.74]  as we are,
[921.24 --> 922.68]  empty-handed recipients
[922.68 --> 923.96]  of a gracious God
[923.96 --> 925.38]  who rather than leave us
[925.38 --> 926.30]  to our own devices
[926.30 --> 928.52]  gave us a baby
[928.52 --> 930.82]  to save us
[930.82 --> 932.60]  because we needed it.
[934.98 --> 936.14]  We read in Titus
[936.14 --> 936.96]  in the New Testament
[936.96 --> 940.48]  where it says,
[940.58 --> 941.68]  but when the kindness
[941.68 --> 942.80]  and love of God
[942.80 --> 943.84]  our Savior appeared,
[944.26 --> 945.22]  He saved us,
[945.34 --> 946.00]  not because of the
[946.00 --> 946.50]  righteous things
[946.50 --> 947.08]  we had done,
[947.38 --> 948.62]  but because His mercy.
[948.86 --> 949.60]  He saved us
[949.60 --> 950.20]  through the washing
[950.20 --> 950.76]  of rebirth
[950.76 --> 951.26]  and renewal
[951.26 --> 952.02]  of the Holy Spirit
[952.02 --> 953.42]  whom He poured out
[953.42 --> 954.58]  on us generously
[954.58 --> 957.26]  through Jesus Christ
[957.26 --> 958.24]  our Savior.
[958.24 --> 961.32]  and this grace
[961.32 --> 961.80]  was given
[961.80 --> 962.60]  before the beginning
[962.60 --> 963.24]  of time,
[963.36 --> 964.54]  but it is now revealed
[964.54 --> 965.18]  in the appearing
[965.18 --> 966.66]  of our Savior Jesus Christ.
[967.22 --> 968.38]  Jesus did not suddenly
[968.38 --> 969.64]  become Savior
[969.64 --> 971.90]  at Christmas time
[971.90 --> 973.62]  or when He died
[973.62 --> 974.28]  for our sins.
[974.50 --> 975.40]  He was born,
[975.52 --> 975.88]  He lived,
[975.96 --> 976.36]  He died,
[976.44 --> 977.26]  He rose again for us
[977.26 --> 979.46]  because He is Savior.
[979.46 --> 982.66]  He always has been.
[984.86 --> 987.30]  Far from doing things
[987.30 --> 988.18]  in order for God
[988.18 --> 989.44]  to love us,
[989.92 --> 990.92]  the good news of Christmas
[990.92 --> 992.02]  is that Jesus came
[992.02 --> 992.80]  to rescue us
[992.80 --> 994.22]  because God has
[994.22 --> 995.78]  always loved us.
[997.08 --> 997.58]  Always.
[999.08 --> 999.96]  That's the story
[999.96 --> 1000.44]  of Scripture.
[1001.50 --> 1002.96]  The incarnation reveals
[1002.96 --> 1004.04]  who God is
[1004.04 --> 1005.44]  and who He has been
[1005.44 --> 1006.30]  all along.
[1006.30 --> 1007.20]  The Holy One
[1007.20 --> 1008.76]  has embraced us
[1008.76 --> 1009.74]  at our worst
[1009.74 --> 1010.70]  and taken us
[1010.70 --> 1013.48]  in our sinful life
[1013.48 --> 1014.54]  to its ignoble end
[1014.54 --> 1015.38]  and given us
[1015.38 --> 1016.20]  a new beginning
[1016.20 --> 1017.42]  and eternal life
[1017.42 --> 1017.90]  for the Father.
[1018.78 --> 1019.76]  To live in grace
[1019.76 --> 1020.98]  is then to share
[1020.98 --> 1022.98]  in the Trinity itself.
[1023.24 --> 1024.38]  To live in Christ
[1024.38 --> 1025.30]  by the Spirit
[1025.30 --> 1026.06]  unto the Father.
[1026.44 --> 1027.26]  Knowing our union
[1027.26 --> 1027.90]  with Christ
[1027.90 --> 1028.78]  and filled with
[1028.78 --> 1029.40]  the Holy Spirit
[1029.40 --> 1030.38]  we find ourselves
[1030.38 --> 1031.76]  then compelled
[1031.76 --> 1032.88]  by love
[1032.88 --> 1033.70]  and motivated
[1033.70 --> 1034.24]  to action.
[1034.24 --> 1035.36]  Then it comes.
[1036.30 --> 1040.66]  Let me tell you folks
[1040.66 --> 1041.48]  that the truth
[1041.48 --> 1042.92]  is not relative.
[1045.30 --> 1046.40]  And we aren't asked
[1046.40 --> 1047.08]  to create our own
[1047.08 --> 1047.72]  version of it.
[1050.18 --> 1051.70]  We are saved
[1051.70 --> 1052.42]  by grace
[1052.42 --> 1053.30]  and we are
[1053.30 --> 1054.22]  led
[1054.22 --> 1056.38]  to the truth.
[1057.50 --> 1058.68]  And then we act
[1058.68 --> 1059.14]  through the power
[1059.14 --> 1059.86]  of the Holy Spirit
[1059.86 --> 1060.94]  and by the guidance
[1060.94 --> 1061.60]  of God's Word.
[1061.60 --> 1066.40]  John 1
[1066.40 --> 1068.36]  John's Gospel
[1068.36 --> 1069.06]  verse 14
[1069.06 --> 1069.60]  we read
[1069.60 --> 1071.22]  the Word became flesh
[1071.22 --> 1072.92]  and made His dwelling
[1072.92 --> 1073.46]  among us.
[1073.54 --> 1074.12]  That's Christmas.
[1076.36 --> 1077.70]  We have seen
[1077.70 --> 1078.36]  His glory
[1078.36 --> 1078.78]  the glory
[1078.78 --> 1079.32]  of the one
[1079.32 --> 1080.14]  and only Son
[1080.14 --> 1081.38]  who came from the Father
[1081.38 --> 1081.96]  notice here
[1081.96 --> 1083.08]  full of grace
[1083.08 --> 1083.56]  and truth.
[1084.10 --> 1085.46]  He is full
[1085.46 --> 1085.90]  of grace
[1085.90 --> 1086.40]  and truth.
[1086.78 --> 1087.14]  And then through
[1087.14 --> 1087.94]  His Spirit
[1087.94 --> 1089.22]  we learn to live
[1089.22 --> 1089.86]  in grace
[1089.86 --> 1090.62]  and truth.
[1093.74 --> 1094.48]  That's what this
[1094.48 --> 1094.88]  is about.
[1098.00 --> 1099.16]  We celebrate
[1099.16 --> 1099.94]  our Savior
[1099.94 --> 1100.84]  who came to us
[1100.84 --> 1101.32]  full of grace
[1101.32 --> 1101.68]  and truth.
[1102.04 --> 1102.46]  And again
[1102.46 --> 1103.78]  we receive that
[1103.78 --> 1105.38]  and then we respond
[1105.38 --> 1105.98]  to what God
[1105.98 --> 1106.44]  has done.
[1108.26 --> 1109.10]  It's interesting
[1109.10 --> 1110.22]  in the book of Acts
[1110.22 --> 1111.00]  we start seeing
[1111.00 --> 1111.58]  this phrase.
[1111.94 --> 1112.14]  We say
[1112.14 --> 1113.00]  in the name
[1113.00 --> 1113.78]  of Jesus.
[1115.38 --> 1115.82]  Right?
[1115.90 --> 1116.60]  In the name
[1116.60 --> 1117.52]  of Jesus.
[1118.34 --> 1119.44]  Jesus ascended
[1119.44 --> 1120.10]  and He left
[1120.10 --> 1120.68]  His followers
[1120.68 --> 1121.60]  to do His work
[1121.60 --> 1122.44]  in the power
[1122.44 --> 1123.02]  of the Spirit
[1123.02 --> 1123.84]  by the truth
[1123.84 --> 1124.54]  of His Word.
[1126.44 --> 1127.82]  We read in Acts 2
[1127.82 --> 1128.44]  38
[1128.44 --> 1129.48]  Peter replied
[1129.48 --> 1130.26]  he's talking
[1130.26 --> 1130.74]  to a crowd
[1130.74 --> 1131.14]  of people
[1131.14 --> 1132.28]  repent and be
[1132.28 --> 1133.26]  baptized every one
[1133.26 --> 1133.56]  of you.
[1133.80 --> 1134.20]  Oh there we go
[1134.20 --> 1134.60]  repent.
[1134.80 --> 1135.42]  You need a Savior.
[1135.68 --> 1136.30]  Repent and be
[1136.30 --> 1137.28]  baptized every one
[1137.28 --> 1137.52]  of you
[1137.52 --> 1138.78]  in the name
[1138.78 --> 1139.68]  of Jesus Christ
[1139.68 --> 1140.32]  by His power
[1140.32 --> 1140.56]  right?
[1142.18 --> 1142.96]  We have seen
[1142.96 --> 1143.74]  in the name
[1143.74 --> 1144.50]  of Jesus Christ
[1144.50 --> 1145.10]  for the forgiveness
[1145.10 --> 1145.76]  of your sins
[1145.76 --> 1146.66]  and you will
[1146.66 --> 1147.64]  receive the gift
[1147.64 --> 1148.42]  of the Holy Spirit.
[1149.16 --> 1149.60]  Again
[1149.60 --> 1150.94]  you are a receiver.
[1153.94 --> 1154.38]  Later
[1154.38 --> 1155.16]  Peter heals
[1155.16 --> 1156.00]  this lame man
[1156.00 --> 1157.08]  and he says
[1157.08 --> 1157.70]  silver and gold
[1157.70 --> 1158.96]  I don't have those
[1158.96 --> 1159.50]  but what I have
[1159.50 --> 1159.94]  I give you
[1159.94 --> 1160.58]  in the name
[1160.58 --> 1161.26]  of Jesus Christ
[1161.26 --> 1161.74]  of Nazareth
[1161.74 --> 1162.42]  walk.
[1164.10 --> 1164.70]  We see this
[1164.70 --> 1165.32]  over and over again
[1165.32 --> 1167.18]  we live in the name
[1167.18 --> 1167.60]  of Jesus
[1167.60 --> 1169.00]  in His power
[1169.00 --> 1169.92]  and we do things
[1169.92 --> 1170.72]  in His name
[1170.72 --> 1172.18]  meaning you do them
[1172.18 --> 1172.70]  in accordance
[1172.70 --> 1173.28]  with everything
[1173.28 --> 1174.30]  that is associated
[1174.30 --> 1175.02]  with Jesus
[1175.02 --> 1176.10]  in the faith
[1176.10 --> 1176.58]  wisdom
[1176.58 --> 1177.08]  power
[1177.08 --> 1177.82]  and holiness
[1177.82 --> 1178.60]  of Jesus
[1178.60 --> 1179.54]  and it means
[1179.54 --> 1180.38]  that you recognize
[1180.38 --> 1181.18]  the power
[1181.18 --> 1182.06]  to do anything
[1182.06 --> 1182.60]  righteous
[1182.60 --> 1183.64]  and holy
[1183.64 --> 1184.84]  comes from Him
[1184.84 --> 1185.64]  and that's why
[1185.64 --> 1186.06]  He said
[1186.06 --> 1186.92]  in the gospel
[1186.92 --> 1187.20]  He said
[1187.20 --> 1188.46]  apart from me
[1188.46 --> 1189.96]  you can do nothing
[1189.96 --> 1193.88]  thank you
[1193.88 --> 1195.30]  that's true
[1195.30 --> 1195.78]  isn't it
[1195.78 --> 1196.96]  you can do nothing
[1196.96 --> 1198.18]  you are branches
[1198.18 --> 1200.00]  I often like
[1200.00 --> 1200.58]  to look at myself
[1200.58 --> 1201.00]  in the mirror
[1201.00 --> 1201.24]  and say
[1201.24 --> 1201.82]  Sid you're a
[1201.82 --> 1202.18]  good looking
[1202.18 --> 1202.58]  branch
[1202.58 --> 1205.86]  you're a branch
[1205.86 --> 1208.50]  you're a branch
[1208.50 --> 1210.72]  and we do nothing
[1210.72 --> 1212.14]  apart from Him
[1212.14 --> 1214.82]  I think Paul
[1214.82 --> 1215.38]  does a beautiful
[1215.38 --> 1216.62]  description
[1216.62 --> 1217.18]  of what it looks
[1217.18 --> 1217.70]  like to live
[1217.70 --> 1218.06]  in the name
[1218.06 --> 1218.44]  of Jesus
[1218.44 --> 1219.10]  in Philippians
[1219.10 --> 1219.48]  I could have
[1219.48 --> 1220.44]  wrote the whole
[1220.44 --> 1220.80]  chapter
[1220.80 --> 1221.28]  but I put
[1221.28 --> 1222.02]  this much down
[1222.02 --> 1222.72]  look at
[1222.72 --> 1223.32]  Philippians 2
[1223.32 --> 1223.82]  1-5
[1223.82 --> 1224.88]  therefore
[1224.88 --> 1226.06]  because Christ
[1226.06 --> 1226.50]  has come
[1226.50 --> 1227.20]  because Christ
[1227.20 --> 1228.20]  has saved us
[1228.20 --> 1228.80]  therefore
[1228.80 --> 1229.70]  if you have
[1229.70 --> 1230.64]  any encouragement
[1230.64 --> 1231.22]  out of that
[1231.22 --> 1231.98]  does it encourage
[1231.98 --> 1232.52]  you that Christ
[1232.52 --> 1232.72]  has come
[1232.72 --> 1233.38]  okay good
[1233.38 --> 1234.42]  any encouragement
[1234.42 --> 1235.18]  from being united
[1235.18 --> 1235.66]  with Christ
[1235.66 --> 1236.22]  if you have
[1236.22 --> 1236.96]  any comfort
[1236.96 --> 1237.74]  from His love
[1237.74 --> 1238.12]  what's going to
[1238.12 --> 1238.34]  happen
[1238.34 --> 1239.76]  any common
[1239.76 --> 1240.88]  sharing in the
[1240.88 --> 1241.18]  spirit
[1241.18 --> 1242.54]  if any tenderness
[1242.54 --> 1243.20]  and compassion
[1243.20 --> 1244.44]  then make my joy
[1244.44 --> 1245.14]  we sing of joy
[1245.14 --> 1246.10]  then make my joy
[1246.10 --> 1247.32]  complete by being
[1247.32 --> 1248.06]  like minded
[1248.06 --> 1251.28]  like minded
[1251.28 --> 1252.00]  mean like we agree
[1252.00 --> 1252.30]  on everything
[1252.30 --> 1252.62]  no
[1252.62 --> 1253.10]  no
[1253.10 --> 1254.36]  a mind of Christ
[1254.36 --> 1255.14]  a love of Christ
[1255.14 --> 1255.54]  that's what we're
[1255.54 --> 1255.96]  talking about here
[1255.96 --> 1256.72]  like minded
[1256.72 --> 1258.28]  having the same love
[1258.28 --> 1259.40]  being one in spirit
[1259.40 --> 1259.96]  one in mind
[1259.96 --> 1260.98]  do nothing
[1260.98 --> 1263.54]  out of selfish ambition
[1263.54 --> 1264.70]  or vain conceit
[1264.70 --> 1265.82]  rather in humility
[1265.82 --> 1266.62]  value others
[1266.62 --> 1267.62]  above yourself
[1267.62 --> 1268.74]  not looking for
[1268.74 --> 1269.74]  your own interests
[1269.74 --> 1271.16]  but each of you
[1271.16 --> 1271.74]  to the interest
[1271.74 --> 1272.36]  of others
[1272.36 --> 1274.14]  in your relationship
[1274.14 --> 1274.74]  with one another
[1274.74 --> 1276.42]  have the same mindset
[1276.42 --> 1278.32]  as Christ Jesus
[1278.32 --> 1279.96]  because of Christmas
[1279.96 --> 1281.84]  you need to have
[1281.84 --> 1282.54]  and develop
[1282.54 --> 1283.50]  and accept
[1283.50 --> 1284.16]  and receive
[1284.16 --> 1285.06]  through the spirit
[1285.06 --> 1285.90]  the mind
[1285.90 --> 1286.66]  of Christ
[1286.66 --> 1293.14]  your humility
[1293.14 --> 1294.16]  should be like Christ
[1294.16 --> 1296.20]  who left glory
[1296.20 --> 1296.96]  and honor behind
[1296.96 --> 1297.64]  when He became
[1297.64 --> 1298.72]  one of us
[1298.72 --> 1302.88]  He subjected Himself
[1302.88 --> 1303.92]  to human limitations
[1303.92 --> 1304.56]  was treated
[1304.56 --> 1305.48]  as an outcast
[1305.48 --> 1306.42]  was crucified
[1306.42 --> 1308.08]  so sin was defeated
[1308.08 --> 1308.98]  and life received
[1308.98 --> 1310.28]  and then He was elevated
[1310.28 --> 1311.24]  to the highest place
[1311.24 --> 1312.32]  and then it says
[1312.32 --> 1313.30]  and every knee will bow
[1313.30 --> 1314.14]  and every tongue confess
[1314.14 --> 1315.30]  that Jesus Christ
[1315.30 --> 1316.16]  is Lord
[1316.16 --> 1320.58]  and every knee will bow
[1320.58 --> 1323.42]  like Joseph did
[1323.42 --> 1326.60]  God saves
[1326.60 --> 1328.16]  and every ruler
[1328.16 --> 1329.32]  and every leader
[1329.32 --> 1330.62]  and every atheist
[1330.62 --> 1331.52]  you name it
[1331.52 --> 1332.08]  any person
[1332.08 --> 1333.30]  everyone from the beginning
[1333.30 --> 1333.78]  of time
[1333.78 --> 1334.70]  to the end of time
[1334.70 --> 1335.86]  will eventually come
[1335.86 --> 1336.50]  to realize
[1336.50 --> 1339.20]  only God saves
[1339.20 --> 1342.42]  only God saves
[1342.42 --> 1346.54]  so then what's the response
[1346.54 --> 1348.56]  I think Paul said that
[1348.56 --> 1349.86]  rather well in Colossians 3
[1349.86 --> 1351.26]  he says
[1351.26 --> 1352.26]  whatever you do
[1352.26 --> 1353.14]  you go ahead and name it
[1353.14 --> 1355.08]  whatever you do
[1355.08 --> 1357.36]  whether in word
[1357.36 --> 1358.50]  or in deed
[1358.50 --> 1359.68]  do it all
[1359.68 --> 1360.70]  in the name
[1360.70 --> 1361.56]  of Jesus
[1361.56 --> 1363.00]  giving thanks
[1363.00 --> 1364.12]  to God the Father
[1364.12 --> 1364.92]  through Him
[1364.92 --> 1367.00]  whatever you do
[1367.00 --> 1367.78]  do it for Jesus
[1367.78 --> 1369.58]  the one who saves
[1369.58 --> 1371.26]  and it is Jesus
[1371.26 --> 1372.02]  whom we celebrate
[1372.02 --> 1373.16]  and we anticipate
[1373.16 --> 1373.88]  His return
[1373.88 --> 1375.36]  and then in that
[1375.36 --> 1376.18]  waiting for that
[1376.18 --> 1376.80]  second coming
[1376.80 --> 1377.92]  when it's genuine
[1377.92 --> 1378.70]  it's from the heart
[1378.70 --> 1379.82]  we live in the power
[1379.82 --> 1380.62]  of the Holy Spirit
[1380.62 --> 1381.86]  waiting for God
[1381.86 --> 1383.02]  to come again to us
[1383.02 --> 1384.34]  and we don't live
[1384.34 --> 1385.40]  by our own devices
[1385.40 --> 1386.70]  spiritual depth
[1386.70 --> 1387.30]  is found
[1387.30 --> 1388.64]  in the work of God
[1388.64 --> 1390.24]  coming down to us
[1390.24 --> 1391.32]  and penetrating
[1391.32 --> 1393.44]  our self-centered hearts
[1393.44 --> 1398.02]  that heart that doesn't
[1398.02 --> 1399.42]  want to be a receiver
[1399.42 --> 1401.24]  but prefers to be the giver
[1401.24 --> 1406.36]  folks it's not about us
[1406.36 --> 1406.96]  climbing up
[1406.96 --> 1409.86]  only as we surrender
[1409.86 --> 1410.68]  our whole lives
[1410.68 --> 1411.76]  can we then respond
[1411.76 --> 1412.78]  in the name
[1412.78 --> 1413.42]  and power
[1413.42 --> 1414.22]  of Jesus
[1414.22 --> 1416.50]  back to the Christmas story
[1416.50 --> 1417.46]  like Mary
[1417.46 --> 1420.52]  look at Mary's response
[1420.52 --> 1421.46]  to what happens
[1421.46 --> 1422.66]  with Jesus coming
[1422.66 --> 1423.40]  look at Luke 1
[1423.40 --> 1423.80]  with me
[1423.80 --> 1425.68]  she'd been told
[1425.68 --> 1426.80]  she's going to have a baby
[1426.80 --> 1429.24]  a miraculous child
[1429.24 --> 1430.24]  how will this be
[1430.24 --> 1430.92]  Mary asked
[1430.92 --> 1432.04]  since I am a virgin
[1432.04 --> 1434.30]  and the angel answered
[1434.30 --> 1435.10]  the Holy Spirit
[1435.10 --> 1436.00]  will come on you
[1436.00 --> 1437.58]  the power of the Most High
[1437.58 --> 1438.96]  will overshadow you
[1438.96 --> 1440.16]  so the Holy One
[1440.16 --> 1440.70]  to be born
[1440.70 --> 1441.36]  will be called
[1441.36 --> 1442.28]  the Son of God
[1442.28 --> 1444.22]  and notice Mary's response
[1444.22 --> 1445.96]  I'm the Lord's servant
[1445.96 --> 1447.24]  Mary answered
[1447.24 --> 1448.80]  may your words
[1448.80 --> 1449.96]  to me be fulfilled
[1449.96 --> 1451.18]  and the angel left her
[1451.18 --> 1452.42]  did she get it all
[1452.42 --> 1453.02]  no
[1453.02 --> 1455.00]  it's you know
[1455.00 --> 1456.06]  it uses the word
[1456.06 --> 1456.68]  Mary pondered
[1456.68 --> 1457.50]  these things in her heart
[1457.50 --> 1458.24]  she's trying to make
[1458.24 --> 1458.84]  sense of it
[1458.84 --> 1459.84]  she doesn't really
[1459.84 --> 1462.00]  how do you understand that
[1462.00 --> 1464.32]  but she accepts it
[1464.32 --> 1465.18]  she surrenders to it
[1465.18 --> 1466.20]  in surrender
[1466.20 --> 1467.60]  Jesus was conceived
[1467.60 --> 1469.02]  and in our daily lives
[1469.02 --> 1469.82]  it is essential
[1469.82 --> 1471.36]  that we too surrender
[1471.36 --> 1475.36]  that we are overshadowed
[1475.36 --> 1478.06]  we're overshadowed
[1478.06 --> 1478.80]  I love that word
[1478.80 --> 1479.80]  overshadowed
[1479.80 --> 1481.68]  I don't need to be
[1481.68 --> 1482.26]  in the front ground
[1482.26 --> 1483.80]  I need to be overshadowed
[1483.80 --> 1484.64]  by the power of the Spirit
[1484.64 --> 1485.50]  by Christ's love
[1485.50 --> 1489.38]  so that we might live
[1489.38 --> 1490.08]  in His name
[1490.08 --> 1490.96]  and by His power
[1490.96 --> 1492.24]  no matter what
[1492.24 --> 1494.04]  circumstances going on
[1494.04 --> 1498.80]  and then God's love
[1498.80 --> 1499.52]  overwhelms us
[1499.52 --> 1500.52]  and breaks into our lives
[1500.52 --> 1502.16]  leaving our human good will
[1502.16 --> 1502.70]  behind
[1502.70 --> 1504.94]  it was never
[1504.94 --> 1505.92]  Christ's purpose
[1505.92 --> 1506.76]  to bring about
[1506.76 --> 1507.84]  self-improvement
[1507.84 --> 1510.32]  He didn't
[1510.32 --> 1511.52]  He became poor
[1511.52 --> 1512.76]  not to offer us
[1512.76 --> 1514.38]  up moral toning
[1514.38 --> 1516.22]  even if that's
[1516.22 --> 1517.30]  good to some degree
[1517.30 --> 1519.40]  the word became flesh
[1519.40 --> 1520.26]  so that the same
[1520.26 --> 1521.26]  amazing life
[1521.26 --> 1522.48]  that broke into the world
[1522.48 --> 1523.48]  when Jesus was born
[1523.48 --> 1525.00]  actually becomes
[1525.00 --> 1525.72]  realized
[1525.72 --> 1526.86]  in our lives
[1526.86 --> 1527.98]  here and now
[1527.98 --> 1530.82]  that's what we're celebrating
[1530.82 --> 1537.32]  that's what we say
[1537.32 --> 1539.24]  when we say to somebody
[1539.24 --> 1540.52]  Merry Christmas
[1540.52 --> 1543.36]  we say surrender your entire life
[1543.36 --> 1544.04]  to Christ
[1544.04 --> 1545.76]  because He came for you
[1545.76 --> 1547.30]  because you need saving
[1547.30 --> 1555.46]  only God's love
[1555.46 --> 1558.14]  not the elevation
[1558.14 --> 1559.00]  of the human soul
[1559.00 --> 1559.60]  can affect
[1559.60 --> 1560.16]  the transformation
[1560.16 --> 1560.82]  of the world
[1560.82 --> 1563.38]  I was reading this story
[1563.38 --> 1564.72]  about St. Francis
[1564.72 --> 1565.96]  who lived in the 1200s
[1565.96 --> 1567.70]  and one of his brother monks
[1567.70 --> 1568.28]  Leo
[1568.28 --> 1568.86]  and they were walking
[1568.86 --> 1569.36]  down the road
[1569.36 --> 1571.12]  I kind of pictured myself
[1571.12 --> 1572.18]  sometimes living like this
[1572.18 --> 1573.78]  and Francis notices
[1573.78 --> 1576.44]  that his monk friend
[1576.44 --> 1577.82]  is pretty unhappy
[1577.82 --> 1578.44]  and he asked him
[1578.44 --> 1578.68]  Leo
[1578.68 --> 1580.28]  do you know what it means
[1580.28 --> 1581.74]  to be pure in heart
[1581.74 --> 1584.64]  of course replied Leo
[1584.64 --> 1587.16]  it means to have no sins
[1587.16 --> 1588.54]  no faults
[1588.54 --> 1589.46]  no weaknesses
[1589.46 --> 1591.18]  to reproach myself for
[1591.18 --> 1593.04]  ah
[1593.04 --> 1593.86]  said Francis
[1593.86 --> 1596.02]  now I understand
[1596.02 --> 1597.10]  why you're sad
[1597.10 --> 1600.12]  we will always have something
[1600.12 --> 1601.56]  to reproach ourselves for
[1601.56 --> 1602.22]  right
[1602.22 --> 1602.92]  said Leo
[1602.92 --> 1603.28]  right
[1603.28 --> 1605.32]  and that's why I despair
[1605.32 --> 1606.66]  of ever getting
[1606.66 --> 1607.68]  a pure heart
[1607.68 --> 1611.48]  Leo
[1611.48 --> 1612.90]  Francis says
[1612.90 --> 1614.78]  listen carefully to me
[1614.78 --> 1617.94]  don't be so preoccupied
[1617.94 --> 1618.92]  with the purity
[1618.92 --> 1619.90]  of your heart
[1619.90 --> 1620.98]  turn
[1620.98 --> 1622.52]  and look at Jesus
[1622.52 --> 1624.56]  admire Him
[1624.56 --> 1627.42]  rejoice that
[1627.42 --> 1629.24]  He is your Savior
[1629.24 --> 1630.14]  and Lord
[1630.14 --> 1632.68]  that's what it means
[1632.68 --> 1634.16]  to be pure in heart
[1634.16 --> 1637.38]  and once you've turned
[1637.38 --> 1637.92]  to Jesus
[1637.92 --> 1640.18]  don't turn back
[1640.18 --> 1641.70]  and start looking
[1641.70 --> 1642.54]  at yourself again
[1642.54 --> 1647.94]  I wonder if we ask
[1647.94 --> 1648.86]  people on the street
[1648.86 --> 1649.62]  what they most want
[1649.62 --> 1650.08]  for Christmas
[1650.08 --> 1651.20]  even here
[1651.20 --> 1651.96]  how many would say
[1651.96 --> 1653.18]  I want to see
[1653.18 --> 1654.16]  and be more
[1654.16 --> 1654.68]  and more
[1654.68 --> 1655.14]  and more
[1655.14 --> 1655.82]  like Jesus
[1655.82 --> 1660.24]  Rabbi Abraham
[1660.24 --> 1660.64]  Heschel
[1660.64 --> 1660.94]  said
[1660.94 --> 1661.68]  Jesus Christ
[1661.68 --> 1662.70]  is of no importance
[1662.70 --> 1663.74]  unless He is
[1663.74 --> 1664.40]  of supreme
[1664.40 --> 1665.20]  importance
[1665.20 --> 1667.78]  one of my favorite
[1667.78 --> 1668.64]  verses out of Hebrews
[1668.64 --> 1669.72]  is
[1669.72 --> 1671.84]  is the passage
[1671.84 --> 1672.46]  out of Hebrews
[1672.46 --> 1673.14]  12
[1673.14 --> 1673.58]  where it says
[1673.58 --> 1674.62]  fix your eyes
[1674.62 --> 1675.30]  on Jesus
[1675.30 --> 1676.52]  the author
[1676.52 --> 1676.98]  and perfecter
[1676.98 --> 1677.40]  of your faith
[1677.40 --> 1678.88]  fix your eyes
[1678.88 --> 1679.24]  on Him
[1679.24 --> 1680.42]  keep your focus
[1680.42 --> 1680.74]  there
[1680.74 --> 1682.14]  don't get distracted
[1682.14 --> 1682.90]  by what's going
[1682.90 --> 1683.70]  on around you
[1683.70 --> 1685.14]  people of God
[1685.14 --> 1686.64]  let this Christmas
[1686.64 --> 1687.48]  remind you
[1687.48 --> 1688.16]  that you
[1688.16 --> 1689.02]  need
[1689.02 --> 1689.92]  saving
[1689.92 --> 1691.26]  ongoing
[1691.26 --> 1692.30]  saving
[1692.30 --> 1695.76]  so does everything
[1695.76 --> 1696.42]  in all creation
[1696.42 --> 1696.88]  in the world
[1696.88 --> 1699.22]  and so God
[1699.22 --> 1700.10]  sent Jesus
[1700.10 --> 1700.96]  because God
[1700.96 --> 1701.52]  saves
[1701.52 --> 1702.16]  it's His work
[1702.16 --> 1703.36]  keep your eyes
[1703.36 --> 1703.74]  on Him
[1703.74 --> 1704.24]  always
[1704.24 --> 1705.58]  live for Him
[1705.58 --> 1706.08]  alone
[1706.08 --> 1706.56]  and whatever
[1706.56 --> 1707.32]  you do
[1707.32 --> 1708.06]  whether in word
[1708.06 --> 1708.46]  or deed
[1708.46 --> 1709.28]  do it all
[1709.28 --> 1709.78]  in the name
[1709.78 --> 1710.72]  of Jesus Christ
[1710.72 --> 1713.90]  and then live out
[1713.90 --> 1715.58]  the blessed news
[1715.58 --> 1716.74]  of Christmas
[1716.74 --> 1718.44]  Emmanuel
[1718.44 --> 1719.84]  God with you
[1719.84 --> 1721.30]  let's pray
[1721.30 --> 1732.78]  father God
[1732.78 --> 1735.10]  we come before you
[1735.10 --> 1735.62]  Lord and
[1735.62 --> 1738.92]  we have to be honest
[1738.92 --> 1739.12]  Lord
[1739.12 --> 1740.04]  sometimes it's hard
[1740.04 --> 1740.66]  for us
[1740.66 --> 1742.30]  to accept
[1742.30 --> 1742.88]  that we need
[1742.88 --> 1743.26]  saving
[1743.26 --> 1744.10]  and yet we do
[1744.10 --> 1744.80]  so badly
[1744.80 --> 1745.72]  I pray that you
[1745.72 --> 1746.62]  help every person
[1746.62 --> 1748.08]  here to realize
[1748.08 --> 1749.46]  the depths
[1749.46 --> 1750.44]  of their brokenness
[1750.44 --> 1751.42]  so they can accept
[1751.42 --> 1752.26]  the immensity
[1752.26 --> 1753.24]  of your salvation
[1753.24 --> 1755.40]  Lord I pray
[1755.40 --> 1756.04]  we may learn
[1756.04 --> 1756.72]  to surrender
[1756.72 --> 1757.42]  more and more
[1757.42 --> 1757.98]  to the power
[1757.98 --> 1758.68]  of your spirit
[1758.68 --> 1759.28]  and your word
[1759.28 --> 1759.88]  in our lives
[1759.88 --> 1760.86]  and that we may
[1760.86 --> 1761.92]  live according
[1761.92 --> 1762.84]  to your will
[1762.84 --> 1763.98]  more and more
[1763.98 --> 1765.68]  not to earn
[1765.68 --> 1766.02]  your love
[1766.02 --> 1766.66]  because we already
[1766.66 --> 1767.24]  have that
[1767.24 --> 1769.22]  Lord I pray
[1769.22 --> 1769.98]  that this Christmas
[1769.98 --> 1770.74]  we may fix
[1770.74 --> 1771.52]  our eyes on you
[1771.52 --> 1772.06]  the author
[1772.06 --> 1772.66]  and perfecter
[1772.66 --> 1773.06]  of our faith
[1773.06 --> 1774.82]  and that we may
[1774.82 --> 1775.72]  live for you alone
[1775.72 --> 1777.24]  and share the good
[1777.24 --> 1777.84]  news with those
[1777.84 --> 1778.40]  around us
[1778.40 --> 1779.98]  thank you Lord
[1779.98 --> 1780.82]  Jesus for coming
[1780.82 --> 1782.10]  and thank you

[1783.78 --> 1785.18]  we pray this all
[1785.18 --> 1786.20]  in Jesus holy name
[1786.20 --> 1787.40]  Amen
