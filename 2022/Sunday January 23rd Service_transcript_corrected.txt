[0.00 → 2.60] Well, we're going to continue our series in the Gospel of John.
[3.52 → 6.90] And I hope that you're continuing to read through it with us.
[7.20 → 10.46] I want to start with a couple questions that I've received.
[10.58 → 14.46] In fact, one of the questions, so just to back up a little bit,
[14.74 → 17.20] we're inviting everyone to read through the Gospel of John.
[17.36 → 20.82] And as you read it, if you have questions, you can, there's a QR code in the bulletin.
[20.88 → 22.34] You can just submit your question. They're anonymous.
[23.22 → 24.66] And so people have done that.
[24.72 → 28.32] And actually, I had one junior youth student just give it to me verbally.
[28.32 → 30.86] And I'm going to incorporate that question into my sermon.
[31.34 → 33.70] But I have one I'm just going to put up on the screen. I think we have it.
[34.16 → 36.22] And this came through the website.
[37.62 → 40.12] The question was, John 3, 13 says,
[41.06 → 44.80] No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven, the Son of Man.
[45.58 → 51.34] I was curious if Lazarus went to heaven when he died for those four days before Jesus raised him to life.
[52.48 → 53.64] You know what my answer to that is?
[53.80 → 57.28] I get four more weeks because we're talking about Lazarus in four weeks from now.
[57.28 → 58.46] So there you go.
[59.78 → 60.92] It's a good question, though.
[61.42 → 65.46] Just so you know, the vision behind this was getting our younger readers of the Bible engaged.
[65.56 → 69.74] But I really do love when friends and people in our church, even those of you who are new,
[69.82 → 71.92] just fire your questions out. We want to bring them to our services.
[72.26 → 74.66] This one I just get more time on, which is a great question.
[76.62 → 79.84] This week and next week, we're looking at John 3 and John 4.
[79.92 → 81.14] And these really do belong together.
[81.14 → 84.50] Next week, we're looking at what is a fairly well-known story, if you grew up in the church,
[84.50 → 89.08] of Jesus meeting a Samaritan woman at a well and bringing her to a place of seeing his identity.
[89.66 → 92.76] And today, we're looking at Jesus meeting with a Jewish man named Nicodemus
[92.76 → 95.22] and introducing him to his identity as well.
[95.28 → 97.40] So if you have your Bible, turn with me to John 3.
[97.70 → 99.18] We're going to read the first 16 verses.
[99.86 → 103.04] And even if you didn't grow up in the church, you're going to recognize the last verse.
[103.12 → 104.86] It's the most famous in the whole Bible, I think.
[105.84 → 107.10] This is John 3.
[107.10 → 113.52] Now, there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus, who was a member of the Jewish ruling council.
[114.44 → 116.02] He came to Jesus at night and said,
[116.16 → 119.98] Rabbi, we know that you're a teacher who has come from God.
[120.84 → 124.36] For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.
[125.82 → 126.62] Jesus replied,
[126.80 → 131.32] Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born again.
[131.32 → 135.62] How can anyone be born when they are old?
[135.88 → 136.66] Nicodemus asked.
[137.32 → 140.66] Surely they cannot enter a second time into the mother's womb to be born.
[141.92 → 142.58] Jesus answered,
[142.70 → 147.36] Very truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit.
[147.96 → 151.20] Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to Spirit.
[152.16 → 154.64] You should not be surprised at my saying, you must be born again.
[154.88 → 156.86] The wind blows wherever it pleases.
[157.42 → 161.00] You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going.
[161.48 → 163.72] So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.
[164.82 → 166.18] How can this be?
[166.52 → 167.32] Nicodemus asked.
[168.32 → 170.20] You are Israel's teacher, said Jesus.
[170.70 → 172.28] And do you not understand these things?
[172.88 → 175.28] Very truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know.
[175.62 → 177.26] And we testify to what we have seen.
[177.34 → 179.58] But still, you people do not accept our testimony.
[180.34 → 182.98] I have spoken to you of earthly things, and you do not believe.
[182.98 → 185.70] How then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?
[186.28 → 189.92] No one has ever gone to heaven except the one who came from heaven,
[189.92 → 191.04] the Son of Man.
[191.62 → 194.02] Just as Moses lifted a snake in the wilderness,
[194.52 → 196.28] so the Son of Man must be lifted,
[196.64 → 199.34] that everyone who believes may have eternal life.
[200.36 → 205.06] For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
[205.58 → 208.88] that whoever believes in him shall not perish,
[209.26 → 211.16] but have everlasting life.
[212.78 → 213.22] Amen.
[213.22 → 217.56] Well, I am going to begin with a story about fireworks.
[218.28 → 218.84] Just kidding.
[220.24 → 222.76] I was actually told by someone I should bring a firework
[222.76 → 223.72] to really up the ante.
[224.46 → 227.06] But this has nothing to do with the sermon.
[227.22 → 229.52] But I would have brought a firework if it did not get confiscated
[229.52 → 230.94] by the police like three years ago.
[231.04 → 232.78] We had a big Halloween party at our house.
[233.18 → 234.22] And our small group came over.
[234.32 → 235.16] Some of you will remember this.
[235.24 → 237.02] And our neighbours came out, and I was lighting up fireworks.
[237.40 → 238.96] And a vehicle came into our little street.
[238.96 → 240.66] And it so happened to be the police officers
[240.66 → 242.76] who then confiscated all of our fireworks.
[243.06 → 244.56] And there's nothing that looks worse
[244.56 → 245.90] than being the pastor on the street
[245.90 → 248.08] who's given all the fireworks over to the cops.
[248.98 → 251.70] So that's why I don't have a firework with me
[251.70 → 253.42] to follow up on Sid's challenge
[253.42 → 254.86] to start the service with fireworks.
[256.52 → 258.66] I actually want to begin by a story
[258.66 → 262.18] about a conversion of someone in 1931
[262.18 → 266.42] who has probably in one way or another shaped us.
[266.70 → 268.56] And you'll see in just a moment how that might be.
[269.70 → 271.84] It's a story that actually begins with three friends,
[272.04 → 273.14] all of whom were professors,
[273.44 → 274.78] two of whom were Oxford professors.
[274.96 → 276.48] The three friends were Hugo Dyson,
[277.04 → 278.80] the second was J.R. Tolkien,
[279.32 → 281.04] and the third was C.S. Lewis.
[282.14 → 284.54] Tolkien and Dyson were devoted believers.
[284.82 → 285.64] They followed Christ.
[285.74 → 286.76] They were serious about their faith
[286.76 → 289.30] and also serious about doing their academics as believers.
[290.34 → 292.50] C.S. Lewis, however, was a modern man.
[292.56 → 293.32] That's how he saw himself.
[293.38 → 294.24] I'm a modern man.
[294.24 → 296.66] He saw himself as sort of the trusted of science
[296.66 → 298.48] and he saw Christianity as the stuff of myth,
[298.48 → 299.76] the stuff of sort of fiction,
[299.88 → 301.80] the Bible not to be really taken seriously.
[302.64 → 303.84] But the three of them were close.
[304.78 → 306.70] And C.S. Lewis journaled about his own conversion
[306.70 → 309.50] and we know that there's a very decisive conversation
[309.50 → 312.22] that took place on September 29, 1931
[312.22 → 313.44] and it started with a dinner.
[314.20 → 315.70] Tolkien, Dyson, and Lewis.
[316.46 → 318.60] And the dinner was opening up a big conversation.
[318.76 → 320.56] Actually, the conversation went right past dinner
[320.56 → 322.52] and they walked around campus at Oxford
[322.52 → 324.04] until three in the morning.
[324.14 → 325.02] So they got their steps in.
[325.76 → 326.56] In that conversation,
[326.70 → 328.18] they talked about everything from fiction.
[328.44 → 329.50] I mean, and just think about this.
[329.80 → 330.98] You're talking Lord of the Rings,
[331.48 → 333.54] Tolkien meets what is to become
[333.54 → 334.62] the Chronicles of Narnia.
[334.82 → 336.38] I would just love to be a fly on the wall.
[336.90 → 338.00] They're talking about fiction.
[338.12 → 338.92] They're talking about their work.
[339.02 → 339.88] They're talking about faith.
[340.74 → 341.46] And C.S. Lewis,
[341.62 → 343.46] who was just like perpetually curious,
[343.70 → 345.04] was pressing in the questions,
[345.64 → 347.46] asking about like how we read the Bible,
[347.60 → 348.42] the genre of the Bible,
[348.48 → 349.28] how we trust it,
[349.54 → 351.10] understanding like what it means,
[351.22 → 352.96] like the resurrection and the death of Jesus.
[352.96 → 355.18] He had real issues with how the death of a person
[355.18 → 356.52] could even bring salvation,
[356.62 → 357.56] like what that even means.
[357.64 → 358.48] And if you didn't grow up in the church,
[358.54 → 359.12] you'd get that.
[360.22 → 361.68] That conversation went till three in the morning
[361.68 → 362.40] and Tolkien's like,
[362.44 → 363.52] you know what, I have to go to bed.
[363.68 → 364.44] And then Dyson's like,
[364.50 → 366.40] no, I got another hour left of conversation in me.
[366.48 → 367.48] They went back to his place
[367.48 → 369.04] and discussed for another hour
[369.04 → 370.14] about Christianity
[370.14 → 371.44] and what it meant to them
[371.44 → 372.34] and their futures.
[373.84 → 375.24] That was decisive for Lewis,
[375.30 → 377.32] who wrote two days later in his journal
[377.32 → 378.92] that he now understood
[378.92 → 380.58] that the Christian story,
[380.80 → 381.22] the Bible,
[381.94 → 383.14] is a true myth.
[383.84 → 384.78] He's on the way to seeing it
[384.78 → 386.18] as events that actually happened.
[387.00 → 387.84] Nine days later,
[387.88 → 388.74] he writes in his journal,
[388.86 → 390.22] I went for a long drive.
[390.52 → 391.78] At the beginning of that drive,
[391.90 → 392.54] I did not believe
[392.54 → 393.80] that Jesus was the Son of God.
[393.86 → 394.88] At the end of that drive,
[395.30 → 397.52] I believed that Jesus was the Son of God.
[398.92 → 399.32] Amen.
[401.40 → 403.62] These are decisive moments for Lewis.
[404.42 → 405.36] And as I already mentioned
[405.36 → 406.74] in our interview with Dan,
[407.22 → 408.22] people come into faith
[408.22 → 409.96] in so many different ways.
[410.52 → 411.78] Some people grow up with it,
[411.88 → 412.34] like me.
[412.80 → 414.36] Others go through a personal tragedy
[414.36 → 415.80] that just shakes their world apart
[415.80 → 416.68] and makes them think about
[416.68 → 417.58] what could be beyond
[417.58 → 418.74] what they see with their eyes.
[419.14 → 420.10] And some people,
[420.62 → 421.34] like Lewis,
[421.78 → 423.62] are perpetually curious.
[424.26 → 425.70] They have to ask the questions.
[425.80 → 426.90] They have to chase down the answers.
[427.16 → 428.32] The stakes are too high.
[429.36 → 430.30] And I happen to think
[430.30 → 431.16] that Nicodemus
[431.16 → 432.40] is one of those people.
[432.40 → 434.16] Nicodemus is someone
[434.16 → 435.56] who just could not let it go.
[436.36 → 437.02] He's the one who's like,
[437.12 → 438.64] I have to meet with Jesus
[438.64 → 441.04] and I have to ask him in person
[441.04 → 442.78] who in the world he is
[442.78 → 444.40] and what in the world he's about.
[444.88 → 445.72] That's Nicodemus.
[446.20 → 446.96] So let me just give you
[446.96 → 447.74] a character sketch.
[447.82 → 448.78] Here's what we know about him.
[449.36 → 450.16] He's a Pharisee.
[450.30 → 451.96] So he's very serious.
[452.06 → 453.22] He's of the strictest group
[453.22 → 454.34] of Jews at the time.
[454.78 → 455.98] That means he took his faith seriously.
[456.06 → 456.80] He wasn't just doing it
[456.80 → 457.80] to keep his grandma happy.
[458.36 → 459.10] He was devoted.
[459.62 → 460.28] But more than that,
[460.28 → 462.38] he was part of the ruling council of Jews.
[462.48 → 463.10] That is to say,
[463.40 → 464.08] he had a high profile.
[465.08 → 466.56] He had significance among his people.
[466.64 → 467.84] He made decisions that shaped
[467.84 → 469.30] how the Jews lived out their faith
[469.30 → 470.52] in the midst of the Roman Empire.
[470.62 → 471.64] This guy was a seriously
[471.64 → 472.74] high profile Jew.
[474.12 → 475.44] And that's precisely why
[475.44 → 477.80] we're told that when he meets with Jesus,
[478.72 → 480.14] he does not meet during the day.
[480.38 → 481.22] He meets at night.
[481.98 → 482.98] And writers of this,
[483.52 → 485.20] or commentators on the Gospel of John
[485.20 → 486.18] say the reason he's doing that
[486.18 → 487.72] is because he's afraid of the consequence,
[487.72 → 489.22] to be seen with Jesus during the day.
[489.50 → 490.66] There's like stakes involved.
[490.74 → 491.40] And you should know that
[491.40 → 492.90] in John chapter 3,
[493.00 → 494.02] right before this passage,
[494.14 → 495.00] if you're reading with us,
[495.38 → 496.38] Jesus goes into the temple
[496.38 → 497.08] and you know what he does?
[497.82 → 499.40] He flips over the tables
[499.40 → 500.66] and he gets all upset
[500.66 → 501.42] with the money changers
[501.42 → 503.14] and he drives these market sellers
[503.14 → 503.84] out of the temple.
[503.96 → 504.70] And so that is to say,
[504.92 → 506.42] Jesus doesn't have many friends right now
[506.42 → 507.20] in the Jewish community.
[508.16 → 508.96] And here's Nicodemus.
[509.04 → 509.20] He's like,
[509.26 → 510.08] I want to meet with him,
[510.54 → 511.74] but I ain't going to be seen with him.
[512.20 → 513.36] And so he secretly meets
[513.36 → 514.30] with Jesus at night.
[514.30 → 516.18] And we get this dialogue
[516.18 → 517.04] between John,
[517.28 → 517.46] sorry,
[517.54 → 518.94] between Jesus and Nicodemus
[518.94 → 520.44] that John narrates for us.
[521.54 → 522.68] I want to highlight at the outset
[522.68 → 523.48] when you read it,
[523.66 → 524.70] you need to know that Nicodemus
[524.70 → 526.56] I don't think is that suspicious of Jesus.
[526.70 → 527.96] Lots of Jews already were.
[528.08 → 529.26] They were threatened by him.
[529.60 → 530.42] But Nicodemus says,
[530.50 → 530.82] number one,
[530.84 → 531.28] he's a teacher.
[531.36 → 532.00] He's a rabbi.
[532.44 → 532.86] And he says,
[532.98 → 534.56] you're sent from God
[534.56 → 535.78] and by the work
[535.78 → 536.74] and the miracles you're doing,
[536.86 → 537.88] clearly God is with you.
[537.96 → 538.58] So Nicodemus,
[538.74 → 539.74] you can tell he's wrestled.
[539.80 → 540.98] He's been thinking about Jesus.
[541.36 → 542.52] He's been thinking about the signs
[542.52 → 543.42] and wonders he's been doing
[543.42 → 544.62] and trying to make sense of it.
[544.96 → 547.08] As someone who does believe in God
[547.08 → 548.00] and he says,
[548.12 → 548.56] okay Jesus,
[548.68 → 549.28] like what is this?
[549.48 → 550.68] Like what's going on here?
[551.96 → 553.20] And so Jesus engages him.
[553.76 → 554.86] He engages the conversation
[554.86 → 555.92] and I want to highlight first
[555.92 → 557.22] what Jesus does not say.
[558.32 → 559.02] I'm struck
[559.02 → 560.76] by how Jesus doesn't sort of
[560.76 → 561.40] invite him in
[561.40 → 562.36] and build on those blocks
[562.36 → 562.98] that Nicodemus,
[563.08 → 564.00] like Nicodemus is sort of
[564.00 → 565.12] building bridges as he speaks.
[565.22 → 565.32] He's like,
[565.40 → 566.18] I know God's with you.
[566.84 → 567.54] I know you're a teacher
[567.54 → 568.34] in the Jewish community.
[568.68 → 569.78] I know God's doing this work
[569.78 → 570.26] through you.
[570.80 → 571.60] And Jesus doesn't say,
[571.66 → 571.78] oh,
[571.82 → 572.52] you're so close,
[572.60 → 573.14] Nicodemus.
[573.42 → 574.98] Like you've got all the pieces there.
[575.02 → 575.44] You're just missing
[575.44 → 576.68] this one little building block.
[577.54 → 578.58] Jesus really bowls
[578.58 → 579.64] Nicodemus over.
[579.74 → 580.58] I think Jesus just
[580.58 → 582.34] stuns him with this reply.
[582.78 → 583.50] And I'll read it for you.
[583.54 → 584.02] He writes,
[584.34 → 585.88] very truly I tell you,
[586.36 → 587.48] no one can see
[587.48 → 588.26] the kingdom of God
[588.26 → 589.88] without being born again.
[591.06 → 591.64] You don't just need
[591.64 → 592.42] another little teaching,
[592.96 → 594.06] not just another thing
[594.06 → 594.88] to add on to what you've
[594.88 → 595.58] already assumed
[595.58 → 596.66] and thought about me.
[597.06 → 598.52] You need Nicodemus
[598.52 → 599.24] and everybody
[599.24 → 601.04] to be born again.
[601.92 → 602.72] And just to geek out
[602.72 → 603.20] on the Greek there,
[603.28 → 604.22] that phrase born again
[604.22 → 605.10] has a double meaning.
[605.20 → 606.26] It sort of means born again
[606.26 → 607.44] or born from above.
[608.48 → 609.60] And Jesus repeats himself
[609.60 → 610.48] in the next few verses.
[610.64 → 610.84] He says,
[610.92 → 611.82] very truly I tell you,
[612.10 → 613.14] no one can enter
[613.14 → 613.90] the kingdom
[613.90 → 615.28] without being born
[615.28 → 616.84] of water and spirit.
[617.64 → 618.52] And the emphasis
[618.52 → 619.54] for Jesus right here
[619.54 → 620.66] is you can't see
[620.66 → 620.98] the kingdom
[620.98 → 621.94] unless God
[621.94 → 622.86] by his spirit
[622.86 → 624.02] and his power
[624.02 → 625.98] births you
[625.98 → 627.20] to see it
[627.20 → 628.08] and enter it.
[629.08 → 629.28] Now,
[629.76 → 630.34] some of us
[630.34 → 630.96] who've grown in the church,
[631.06 → 632.04] you know that this phrase
[632.04 → 632.46] born again
[632.46 → 633.20] is fairly popular.
[633.54 → 633.88] Although,
[634.02 → 634.52] I will say,
[634.66 → 635.34] I don't hear too many
[635.34 → 636.02] Canadian Christians
[636.02 → 636.88] talking about being
[636.88 → 637.40] born again.
[638.00 → 638.68] Do you hear that?
[639.38 → 640.08] I know in the States
[640.08 → 641.48] it's a fairly common phrase,
[641.54 → 642.76] like I'm a born again Christian
[642.76 → 643.62] and I don't hear anyone
[643.62 → 644.02] saying that.
[644.06 → 644.66] Maybe we just don't like
[644.66 → 645.10] that phrase,
[645.16 → 645.68] I'm not sure.
[646.78 → 647.76] But I want to tease out
[647.76 → 648.10] this morning,
[648.16 → 648.78] I want to spend some time
[648.78 → 649.54] on, first,
[649.68 → 650.52] what does Jesus mean
[650.52 → 651.00] when he says,
[651.20 → 652.22] see the kingdom of God?
[652.26 → 653.14] Like, what is the kingdom?
[653.36 → 654.00] What's he talking about?
[654.06 → 654.52] And secondly,
[654.68 → 655.40] I want to hone in on
[655.40 → 655.96] what in the world
[655.96 → 657.30] it means to be born again.
[657.82 → 658.78] Like, what does that look like?
[658.82 → 659.30] What does it mean?
[659.36 → 660.30] How do we know it's happened?
[660.78 → 661.56] That's what we're going to focus
[661.56 → 662.42] some of our time on
[662.42 → 662.94] this morning.
[663.10 → 663.62] So first,
[664.56 → 666.26] what is this kingdom of God
[666.26 → 668.30] that Nicodemus cannot see
[668.30 → 669.58] unless he's born again?
[670.96 → 672.04] The reason Jesus
[672.04 → 673.54] didn't explain to Nicodemus
[673.54 → 674.52] what the kingdom was
[674.52 → 676.08] is because Nicodemus
[676.08 → 677.06] knew what it was.
[677.96 → 678.72] For us living
[678.72 → 680.12] in our current moment,
[680.24 → 680.86] no one's talking about
[680.86 → 681.24] this thing called
[681.24 → 681.76] the kingdom of God,
[681.84 → 682.68] but Jewish people,
[682.88 → 684.10] they were talking about it,
[684.14 → 685.00] they were praying for it,
[685.00 → 686.16] they were desperately hoping
[686.16 → 686.78] it would come.
[687.22 → 687.94] The kingdom of God
[687.94 → 689.52] was that final day
[689.52 → 691.86] when God would act in power,
[691.96 → 692.96] he would get rid of oppression,
[693.14 → 694.06] he would get rid of evil,
[694.24 → 696.56] he would establish his rule
[696.56 → 697.54] in the world forever.
[697.64 → 698.62] He would pour out his spirit,
[699.18 → 700.44] he would restore his people,
[700.58 → 701.50] he would heal the creation,
[701.74 → 702.70] that was the kingdom.
[703.22 → 704.44] That final day
[704.44 → 706.04] when God would act decisively
[706.04 → 707.34] and bring his renewal
[707.34 → 708.50] that the prophets promised
[708.50 → 710.04] all throughout the Old Testament.
[710.24 → 710.82] That's the kingdom.
[711.26 → 711.92] God's rule,
[712.26 → 713.28] the world perfected,
[713.28 → 715.10] God's people established again
[715.10 → 715.72] in their place.
[717.44 → 719.22] What made Jesus so confusing,
[719.34 → 720.08] and I've said this before,
[720.18 → 720.84] but I'll remind you,
[720.90 → 722.02] what made Jesus so confusing
[722.02 → 722.82] to Jewish people
[722.82 → 724.28] is that what was supposed
[724.28 → 725.50] to happen at the end
[725.50 → 727.40] broke into the present
[727.40 → 727.92] in Jesus.
[728.78 → 729.84] So these miracles,
[730.12 → 730.84] as we've talked about,
[731.02 → 732.16] they're all snapshots
[732.16 → 733.04] of the way the world
[733.04 → 733.82] is going to be
[733.82 → 734.94] when God returns, right?
[735.12 → 736.36] He heals the sick person,
[736.56 → 737.58] he cures the leper,
[737.92 → 738.66] he does all these,
[738.66 → 739.66] he calms the storm,
[739.76 → 740.92] all of this is a sneak preview
[740.92 → 741.64] of that's the way
[741.64 → 742.56] the world's going to be
[742.56 → 743.44] at the end.
[743.60 → 744.86] But now it's breaking
[744.86 → 745.82] into the present
[745.82 → 746.72] through Jesus.
[747.42 → 748.08] And the Jews are like,
[748.12 → 748.54] whoa, whoa, whoa,
[748.60 → 749.72] how can the Messiah be here?
[749.80 → 751.14] How can this kingdom be here
[751.14 → 752.46] but not fully here?
[753.10 → 753.94] That's the confusion.
[754.98 → 755.88] And then Jesus says,
[756.36 → 758.24] you can't even see it
[758.24 → 760.48] or enter it
[760.48 → 761.96] unless you've been born
[761.96 → 762.76] from above
[762.76 → 763.66] or born again.
[764.74 → 765.80] And I think, by the way,
[765.84 → 766.96] that would be radically offensive
[766.96 → 767.94] to Nicodemus.
[767.94 → 770.36] Of course,
[770.44 → 771.46] one of my favourite lines
[771.46 → 771.96] in this passage,
[772.02 → 772.38] by the way,
[772.44 → 773.06] is Nicodemus,
[773.14 → 773.52] he's just like,
[773.54 → 774.60] I picture him scratching his head,
[774.62 → 774.82] he's like,
[774.88 → 775.22] whoa, whoa, whoa,
[775.22 → 775.56] wait a minute,
[775.60 → 776.70] I've got to be born again.
[776.84 → 777.20] So like,
[777.44 → 778.36] I've got to like literally
[778.36 → 779.58] go into my mother's womb
[779.58 → 781.36] and get born a second time?
[781.76 → 782.50] And in my mind,
[782.54 → 783.46] I picture Jesus like,
[784.66 → 785.92] no, Nicodemus,
[785.96 → 787.18] you do not need to do that
[787.18 → 788.18] mercifully
[788.18 → 788.92] for all the mothers
[788.92 → 789.46] in the world.
[792.02 → 793.16] But I spent a lot of time
[793.16 → 793.58] this week
[793.58 → 794.82] thinking about that image
[794.82 → 795.88] of being born again.
[795.88 → 798.12] But how Jesus picks up
[798.12 → 798.72] on, I think,
[798.74 → 800.22] a very strong image
[800.22 → 801.28] of birth
[801.28 → 802.70] to talk about
[802.70 → 803.56] becoming a Christian,
[804.24 → 804.92] to talk about
[804.92 → 805.86] becoming a believer
[805.86 → 807.10] in Jesus.
[808.30 → 809.48] And perhaps
[809.48 → 810.70] the parents among us
[810.70 → 811.28] can remember
[811.28 → 812.84] when kids are born.
[813.22 → 814.18] I remember some of them,
[814.24 → 814.98] I'm a bit of a fainter,
[815.10 → 816.06] so it's a bit of a foggy
[816.06 → 816.66] memory for me.
[816.92 → 817.84] But I do remember
[817.84 → 819.20] the doctor holding up Levi
[819.20 → 820.60] for the first time
[820.60 → 822.02] and the first thing
[822.02 → 822.54] I remember is thinking,
[822.68 → 822.98] oh man,
[823.00 → 823.70] I predicted a girl
[823.70 → 824.36] and it was a boy
[824.36 → 825.34] and Brittany wins the bet
[825.34 → 825.80] and all that.
[826.04 → 826.70] But I do remember
[826.70 → 827.50] the doctor,
[827.92 → 828.58] it's okay,
[828.64 → 829.34] we got two of each,
[829.40 → 829.74] we're happy.
[830.66 → 831.92] The doctor held Levi up,
[831.96 → 832.54] he's over there,
[832.70 → 833.56] and Levi was so tiny,
[833.64 → 834.42] he came two weeks early,
[834.54 → 835.00] we weren't ready
[835.00 → 835.54] for him to come,
[835.80 → 836.64] and he was so little
[836.64 → 837.60] and he's just hanging there
[837.60 → 838.86] and then he opens his eyes.
[839.62 → 840.10] And I was like,
[840.16 → 840.96] oh my goodness,
[841.06 → 841.98] this whole parenting thing
[841.98 → 842.66] is amazing.
[843.46 → 844.84] And he observes the world
[844.84 → 845.54] for the first time
[845.54 → 846.26] and he hears us
[846.26 → 846.86] for the first time
[846.86 → 847.52] and we see him
[847.52 → 848.02] for the first time.
[848.08 → 848.72] It's amazing,
[848.84 → 850.22] it's like a spiritual experience
[850.22 → 851.20] to go through
[851.20 → 851.94] the process of birth,
[852.02 → 854.02] minus the whole crime scene
[854.02 → 854.52] part of it,
[854.62 → 855.04] where it's,
[855.66 → 855.82] yeah,
[855.84 → 856.06] anyway.
[857.82 → 859.18] I was born for the 70s
[859.18 → 859.68] and the 60s
[859.68 → 860.72] where you drop your wife off
[860.72 → 861.66] and you come back to work
[861.66 → 862.56] and you pick her back up.
[863.72 → 864.48] Don't judge me,
[864.56 → 865.12] I'm a fainter.
[866.00 → 867.22] Now I lost my spot.
[870.34 → 871.64] But Jesus used this image
[871.64 → 871.98] of birth
[871.98 → 872.98] to talk about
[872.98 → 874.22] spiritual birth.
[874.66 → 875.68] And I think that's powerful.
[875.80 → 876.64] There is a real sense
[876.64 → 877.04] in which
[877.04 → 878.54] to become born again
[878.54 → 879.54] by the power of the Spirit
[879.54 → 880.48] is to have your eyes opened,
[880.48 → 881.74] to see the world,
[882.18 → 882.86] to have your ears opened,
[882.90 → 884.68] to hear for the first time,
[884.92 → 886.44] to inhabit reality
[886.44 → 887.80] as it really is.
[888.24 → 888.90] It's rebirth.
[890.14 → 891.40] That's what the Spirit is doing.
[891.50 → 892.10] It's enabling us
[892.10 → 893.12] to live as children,
[893.24 → 893.98] to see the world
[893.98 → 894.94] for the first time
[894.94 → 896.32] as it truly is.
[898.02 → 899.00] I'm struck by how
[899.00 → 900.32] C.S. Lewis in his own story,
[900.84 → 901.82] right after describing
[901.82 → 903.34] believing that the Son is,
[903.46 → 904.60] or Jesus is the Son of God,
[905.04 → 905.34] he says,
[905.46 → 905.78] for me,
[905.90 → 906.84] coming to this reality
[906.84 → 908.74] was like waking up.
[909.48 → 910.02] Is that interesting?
[910.74 → 911.70] As there's this sense,
[911.82 → 912.18] and in fact,
[912.20 → 912.88] we were just talking about this,
[912.90 → 913.48] there's a sense in which
[913.48 → 914.80] before he knew who Jesus was
[914.80 → 916.06] and what the real story was,
[916.26 → 916.84] there's a sense in which
[916.84 → 917.48] he felt asleep
[917.48 → 918.14] and then believing
[918.14 → 919.02] that Jesus was his Son,
[919.30 → 920.02] seeing how the story
[920.02 → 920.50] fits together,
[920.54 → 920.76] he's like,
[920.90 → 921.22] oh,
[922.22 → 923.20] I'm waking up.
[924.76 → 924.94] Now,
[924.98 → 926.20] there's been a lot of writers
[926.20 → 926.98] over the years
[926.98 → 928.02] who've tried to make sense
[928.02 → 928.80] of this experience
[928.80 → 929.94] of spiritual rebirth,
[930.04 → 930.96] of being born again.
[931.52 → 931.84] In fact,
[931.88 → 932.50] a number of them are like,
[932.56 → 932.68] okay,
[932.84 → 934.48] just interviewing people saying,
[934.56 → 934.68] okay,
[934.72 → 935.56] how did this work for you?
[935.62 → 936.26] How does this look for you?
[936.40 → 937.04] What does it mean
[937.04 → 937.52] to be born again?
[937.54 → 938.22] How do we know
[938.22 → 938.96] we're born again?
[938.96 → 939.94] I think a lot of Christians
[939.94 → 941.00] at some point in their life,
[941.26 → 942.20] they look back perhaps
[942.20 → 943.08] in a place of tragedy
[943.08 → 943.26] and say,
[943.34 → 943.44] okay,
[943.56 → 943.72] like,
[944.36 → 945.14] am I born again?
[945.32 → 946.06] Do I believe this?
[946.12 → 947.72] How do I know I'm born again?
[947.82 → 948.96] These are important questions.
[949.70 → 950.62] And just to summarize,
[950.92 → 951.54] I can't go into
[951.54 → 952.32] all the details here,
[952.34 → 953.06] but just to summarize
[953.06 → 953.76] the thought
[953.76 → 955.46] of some very bright people,
[956.40 → 957.34] some key features
[957.34 → 958.30] of being born again
[958.30 → 959.04] are number one,
[960.18 → 961.04] you see new.
[962.30 → 963.62] You hear new.
[964.62 → 966.10] Your mind takes in
[966.10 → 967.30] new truth
[967.30 → 969.20] and your heart
[969.20 → 970.14] is moved.
[973.06 → 973.90] There was a time,
[974.02 → 975.24] perhaps right now
[975.24 → 975.64] as I preach,
[975.70 → 976.30] you're thinking about
[976.30 → 977.14] that story for you.
[977.26 → 977.72] You're thinking about
[977.72 → 978.74] that process of before
[978.74 → 979.28] and after
[979.28 → 980.06] and the journey
[980.06 → 981.10] of coming to faith,
[981.14 → 982.04] the journey of believing
[982.04 → 982.78] and taking in all
[982.78 → 983.42] this new stuff
[983.42 → 983.92] about Jesus.
[984.42 → 985.26] You can perhaps remember
[985.26 → 985.92] where someone said,
[986.00 → 986.60] hey, there's a God
[986.60 → 986.88] and you're like,
[986.94 → 987.84] that's crazy.
[988.84 → 989.48] And then somehow
[989.48 → 990.72] over the course of the years
[990.72 → 990.90] you're like,
[990.94 → 992.12] not only is there a God,
[992.82 → 994.94] but Jesus is fully God.
[994.94 → 996.18] and the Spirit
[996.18 → 997.42] has made known Jesus to me
[997.42 → 998.64] and Jesus is not just a person,
[998.74 → 999.86] he's the Saviour.
[1001.12 → 1002.34] Your eyes have been opened.
[1003.08 → 1003.72] That's evidence
[1003.72 → 1004.48] of the Spirit
[1004.48 → 1005.82] regenerating our hearts
[1005.82 → 1006.48] and minds.
[1008.16 → 1009.16] Not only that,
[1009.62 → 1010.84] I often think in the West,
[1010.90 → 1011.62] if you talk about
[1011.62 → 1012.88] this person called the devil,
[1013.56 → 1014.28] that is like taking
[1014.28 → 1015.42] the train to crazy town,
[1015.72 → 1015.98] right?
[1016.82 → 1017.66] You know this,
[1017.74 → 1018.16] in work,
[1018.26 → 1018.80] with your family,
[1019.02 → 1019.58] your neighbourhood,
[1019.68 → 1020.36] like you talk about Satan,
[1020.44 → 1020.56] you're like,
[1020.64 → 1020.98] pardon me,
[1021.04 → 1021.70] did you just mention
[1021.70 → 1022.30] like Satan?
[1023.24 → 1024.24] And perhaps you can remember
[1024.24 → 1024.96] being that person,
[1025.08 → 1027.04] but after following
[1027.04 → 1028.34] and learning who Jesus is
[1028.34 → 1029.52] and taking Scripture seriously,
[1029.52 → 1030.10] you realize,
[1030.16 → 1031.26] you get to Ephesians 6
[1031.26 → 1031.96] where it talks about
[1031.96 → 1033.36] sort of our battles
[1033.36 → 1034.54] not against flesh and blood
[1034.54 → 1035.40] but against the powers
[1035.40 → 1036.28] and the principalities
[1036.28 → 1036.96] and the heavenly realms
[1036.96 → 1037.40] and all of a sudden
[1037.40 → 1037.76] you're like,
[1038.60 → 1039.10] mm-hmm,
[1040.14 → 1041.48] there is more going on
[1041.48 → 1042.24] that meets the eyes.
[1042.32 → 1043.04] There is a battle
[1043.04 → 1044.38] between God and evil
[1044.38 → 1045.22] that is going on
[1045.22 → 1046.28] and we see it.
[1046.62 → 1046.96] Why?
[1047.12 → 1047.92] Because the Spirit
[1047.92 → 1049.42] has opened our eyes.
[1049.90 → 1050.88] Our ears are open
[1050.88 → 1051.92] to the truth of Scripture.
[1052.66 → 1053.08] And I mean,
[1053.16 → 1053.94] as a youth pastor,
[1054.14 → 1055.28] one of my favourite things
[1055.28 → 1057.92] was seeing how people's ears
[1057.92 → 1058.66] and eyes were open
[1058.66 → 1059.18] to the Scriptures,
[1059.36 → 1059.80] specifically.
[1060.24 → 1061.30] I've seen this so many times
[1061.30 → 1062.48] where you can grow up
[1062.48 → 1062.98] in the church,
[1063.32 → 1064.52] you've heard the Scriptures read,
[1064.58 → 1065.60] your parents taught you them,
[1065.78 → 1066.64] you went to Sunday school
[1066.64 → 1067.16] and there's a sense
[1067.16 → 1067.64] in which the book
[1067.64 → 1068.76] just feels lifeless to you.
[1068.86 → 1070.24] But then something happens
[1070.24 → 1071.30] and it's different
[1071.30 → 1071.82] for every person
[1071.82 → 1072.30] but all of a sudden
[1072.30 → 1072.78] they're reading it
[1072.78 → 1073.06] and they're like,
[1073.58 → 1074.60] oh, wow.
[1075.60 → 1076.54] God's speaking to me
[1076.54 → 1077.12] right now.
[1077.20 → 1077.82] It's like he's read
[1077.82 → 1078.36] my journal.
[1078.58 → 1079.54] This verse is like
[1079.54 → 1081.10] my life in a nutshell
[1081.10 → 1082.34] or Matthew 22,
[1082.52 → 1083.84] the summary of the Gospel.
[1085.02 → 1085.52] There's a sense
[1085.52 → 1086.14] in which the Scriptures
[1086.14 → 1086.60] come alive.
[1086.66 → 1087.20] And you know what that is?
[1087.24 → 1088.28] The Bible didn't change.
[1088.86 → 1089.72] What changed was
[1089.72 → 1090.78] the Spirit opened
[1090.78 → 1091.86] your eyes and your ears
[1091.86 → 1093.86] to see the true story
[1093.86 → 1095.12] and to live it
[1095.12 → 1095.86] and love it.
[1096.74 → 1097.06] And like,
[1097.14 → 1097.70] as a youth pastor,
[1097.74 → 1098.22] as a pastor,
[1098.28 → 1098.72] I'll say that's one
[1098.72 → 1099.72] of the most beautiful things.
[1099.82 → 1100.08] It's like,
[1100.44 → 1101.78] now you hear God speak.
[1102.64 → 1103.38] Now you're tuned
[1103.38 → 1104.18] to his voice.
[1108.36 → 1108.68] Augustine,
[1108.84 → 1109.66] who's a writer
[1109.66 → 1110.10] who's shaped
[1110.10 → 1110.74] Western history
[1110.74 → 1111.44] pretty dramatically.
[1112.32 → 1112.74] In his own,
[1112.84 → 1114.16] he's had a conversion story
[1114.16 → 1114.78] as a young adult
[1114.78 → 1115.20] and he wrote it
[1115.20 → 1116.00] in the book Confessions.
[1116.12 → 1116.36] In fact,
[1116.44 → 1117.04] if you're a reader,
[1117.32 → 1118.22] I do encourage you
[1118.22 → 1118.82] to read that book
[1118.82 → 1119.72] because it's a powerful
[1119.72 → 1120.68] autobiography
[1120.68 → 1121.86] of how he came to faith
[1121.86 → 1122.70] in the midst of his struggles
[1122.70 → 1123.52] as a young man
[1123.52 → 1124.18] and all of it.
[1124.70 → 1125.68] But he talks a lot
[1125.68 → 1126.54] about how conversion,
[1127.18 → 1128.16] a sign of conversion,
[1128.58 → 1129.30] a sign of sort of
[1129.30 → 1129.86] being reborn
[1129.86 → 1132.02] is your desires change.
[1132.02 → 1133.40] It's not just that
[1133.40 → 1133.60] you're reading
[1133.60 → 1134.46] the Bible differently.
[1134.60 → 1135.02] It's not just that
[1135.02 → 1135.68] your ears are tuned.
[1135.74 → 1135.96] It's like,
[1136.02 → 1137.86] you have these new desires.
[1138.72 → 1139.60] You have this sense of like,
[1139.66 → 1140.96] I used to be someone
[1140.96 → 1142.00] and I now understand
[1142.00 → 1143.22] that person's full of sin.
[1143.34 → 1143.52] In fact,
[1143.56 → 1143.88] you're going to hear
[1143.88 → 1144.68] a testimony about that
[1144.68 → 1145.20] in a few weeks.
[1145.56 → 1146.98] And now I have a desire
[1146.98 → 1147.76] to change.
[1148.62 → 1149.94] A desire to become
[1149.94 → 1150.92] like Jesus.
[1151.04 → 1152.62] A desire to put away
[1152.62 → 1153.78] that old self
[1153.78 → 1155.86] and put on the new self
[1155.86 → 1156.52] that is being made
[1156.52 → 1157.08] in the likeness
[1157.08 → 1158.14] of Jesus Christ
[1158.14 → 1158.96] through the work
[1158.96 → 1159.66] of the Holy Spirit.
[1162.02 → 1162.30] You know,
[1162.36 → 1163.32] one that I've heard
[1163.32 → 1164.02] just anecdotally
[1164.02 → 1165.26] from a few of my own friends.
[1166.02 → 1167.00] Before becoming a Christian,
[1167.08 → 1167.88] one of the weirdest things
[1167.88 → 1169.90] for them was this.
[1170.36 → 1170.62] They're like,
[1170.68 → 1171.58] people just like gather
[1171.58 → 1172.28] on a Sunday morning
[1172.28 → 1173.60] and they like do karaoke together.
[1173.76 → 1173.98] Like,
[1174.08 → 1175.24] this is what it is.
[1175.68 → 1175.98] Right?
[1176.12 → 1176.64] And you know,
[1176.72 → 1177.30] all of a sudden,
[1177.40 → 1178.36] like God's working their life.
[1178.44 → 1178.96] They meet some people
[1178.96 → 1179.54] who are part of church.
[1179.62 → 1180.36] They go to church
[1180.36 → 1181.66] and all of a sudden
[1181.66 → 1182.22] they see like,
[1182.34 → 1182.58] whoa,
[1183.58 → 1184.48] this is powerful.
[1185.04 → 1185.76] These songs
[1185.76 → 1186.46] that we get to worship
[1186.46 → 1186.92] and you know,
[1186.98 → 1187.36] all of a sudden
[1187.36 → 1188.04] they're now driving
[1188.04 → 1188.76] down Fraser Highway
[1188.76 → 1189.54] and they don't turn it down,
[1189.60 → 1190.32] they turn it up.
[1190.32 → 1191.52] And they're singing along
[1191.52 → 1192.04] and there might be
[1192.04 → 1192.92] like this little tear
[1192.92 → 1193.50] coming down.
[1193.58 → 1193.78] They're like,
[1193.86 → 1194.08] oh,
[1194.32 → 1195.44] this is so powerful.
[1195.54 → 1196.22] Singing about Jesus.
[1196.46 → 1197.58] And it's just another sign
[1197.58 → 1199.60] of God's Spirit
[1199.60 → 1201.16] changing hearts.
[1202.14 → 1202.72] God's Spirit
[1202.72 → 1203.74] opening minds
[1203.74 → 1204.74] and ears,
[1205.12 → 1206.08] helping us see
[1206.08 → 1206.82] that Jesus
[1206.82 → 1208.66] is Lord.
[1208.66 → 1211.02] are you thinking
[1211.02 → 1212.74] back to your own story?
[1217.58 → 1218.32] One of the things
[1218.32 → 1218.90] that I appreciated
[1218.90 → 1219.98] one commentator making
[1219.98 → 1220.84] about this passage
[1220.84 → 1223.06] is that babies are born
[1223.06 → 1224.32] in many different ways.
[1224.56 → 1225.00] I have, you know,
[1225.04 → 1225.86] I have so much experience
[1225.86 → 1226.14] in this.
[1226.18 → 1228.22] I'm told that some moms
[1228.22 → 1229.06] have easy
[1229.06 → 1230.66] and painless births.
[1232.20 → 1232.60] Oh,
[1232.70 → 1233.40] someone raised their hand there.
[1234.30 → 1235.16] I don't know that.
[1235.24 → 1235.54] I'm not a
[1235.72 → 1236.58] I've never had a baby.
[1237.22 → 1237.94] But I'm told
[1237.94 → 1238.82] there are those moms out there
[1238.82 → 1240.08] and some are slow
[1240.08 → 1241.10] and painful.
[1241.44 → 1242.12] And to even ask
[1242.12 → 1242.60] the mother about it,
[1242.62 → 1242.74] it's like,
[1242.78 → 1243.02] yeah, no,
[1243.06 → 1244.00] we're not going to go there today.
[1245.60 → 1246.38] Some children
[1246.38 → 1247.78] come out like chill
[1247.78 → 1248.56] and even keel.
[1248.70 → 1249.48] Some come out
[1249.48 → 1250.40] kicking and screaming.
[1251.02 → 1252.06] Some come out backwards,
[1252.18 → 1252.72] they're poor mothers.
[1253.18 → 1254.30] Some need forceps
[1254.30 → 1256.08] and need to be pulled out.
[1257.84 → 1258.52] Births come in many
[1258.52 → 1259.06] different ways
[1259.06 → 1259.80] and so it is
[1259.80 → 1260.76] with our spiritual birth.
[1261.26 → 1261.78] I appreciated
[1261.78 → 1262.74] what Dan mentioned earlier
[1262.74 → 1263.54] about how there's a sense
[1263.54 → 1264.62] in which everyone's story
[1264.62 → 1265.48] is so unique.
[1266.18 → 1266.88] Everyone's journey,
[1267.00 → 1267.92] the questions they're asking,
[1268.02 → 1268.66] what God's doing,
[1268.76 → 1269.22] who he's bringing
[1269.22 → 1269.76] into their life,
[1269.84 → 1270.58] how he's orchestrating
[1270.58 → 1271.00] all of it,
[1271.22 → 1272.38] it's unique to them.
[1272.46 → 1273.40] But the point is
[1273.40 → 1274.52] and the beautiful thing is
[1274.52 → 1275.86] the birth happens.
[1276.32 → 1276.84] Don't you think?
[1277.58 → 1278.32] The person sitting
[1278.32 → 1279.14] beside you right now,
[1279.38 → 1280.50] they've got a story
[1280.50 → 1281.58] about how Jesus
[1281.58 → 1282.38] by the Spirit
[1282.38 → 1283.16] opened their eyes
[1283.16 → 1283.74] and so do you.
[1284.68 → 1285.88] And one of my frustrations,
[1286.04 → 1286.80] if I can name this,
[1286.84 → 1287.50] is that in the church
[1287.50 → 1288.36] sometimes we obsess
[1288.36 → 1289.40] over the dramatic.
[1290.30 → 1290.46] You know,
[1290.48 → 1290.94] when I was a kid
[1290.94 → 1291.52] we had chapel
[1291.52 → 1292.04] in our high school.
[1292.12 → 1292.98] We always brought in
[1292.98 → 1293.90] like the craziest
[1293.90 → 1294.98] conversion stories.
[1294.98 → 1296.06] It's always involving
[1296.06 → 1296.74] like drugs
[1296.74 → 1297.68] and murder
[1297.68 → 1298.46] and jail
[1298.46 → 1299.10] and all the rest
[1299.10 → 1299.44] and you're like,
[1299.52 → 1299.66] wow,
[1299.92 → 1301.52] I guess I'll never have that.
[1301.76 → 1302.66] I don't want to do
[1302.66 → 1303.28] all those things
[1303.28 → 1304.42] but they came to Christ.
[1305.10 → 1305.70] But there's a sense
[1305.70 → 1305.98] in which,
[1306.06 → 1306.20] okay,
[1306.28 → 1306.78] that's true.
[1306.94 → 1307.72] God at work
[1307.72 → 1309.84] by the story of the story
[1309.84 → 1310.34] of the teen
[1310.34 → 1311.00] who's just struggling
[1311.00 → 1311.88] with some stuff,
[1312.44 → 1313.36] whose parents split up,
[1313.40 → 1314.32] who's asking hard questions,
[1314.40 → 1315.16] who's in a low place,
[1315.20 → 1315.94] who finds a friend
[1315.94 → 1316.80] who follows Jesus
[1316.80 → 1317.68] and a friend
[1317.68 → 1318.50] who invites him to church
[1318.50 → 1319.34] and their eyes are open,
[1319.56 → 1321.34] that story is just as beautiful
[1321.34 → 1322.42] in the eyes of Christ
[1322.42 → 1324.22] as the dramatic conversion.
[1324.64 → 1325.60] The story of the slow,
[1325.80 → 1326.90] steady learning of the gospel
[1326.90 → 1327.74] from your youngest years,
[1328.18 → 1329.70] God is praised in that.
[1330.26 → 1330.96] And to use the language
[1330.96 → 1331.46] of the Bible,
[1331.72 → 1332.60] the angels celebrate
[1332.60 → 1333.58] just as much
[1333.58 → 1334.92] over every child,
[1334.92 → 1335.48] no matter how
[1335.48 → 1336.36] they come into the faith.
[1336.94 → 1337.92] God is glorified
[1337.92 → 1338.50] by the conversion
[1338.50 → 1340.08] no matter how it happens.
[1340.44 → 1341.46] When the birth happens,
[1342.26 → 1342.94] God is at work.
[1347.46 → 1348.58] Maybe just to say
[1348.58 → 1349.30] one last thing
[1349.30 → 1350.12] that's worth highlighting
[1350.12 → 1351.26] about this image of birth
[1351.26 → 1352.18] that Jesus uses
[1352.18 → 1354.88] is how much work
[1354.88 → 1355.82] does the baby do
[1355.82 → 1358.04] in the process of birth?
[1360.72 → 1361.50] Not a lot.
[1362.50 → 1363.88] The mom does all the work
[1363.88 → 1364.96] and I think that's important
[1364.96 → 1365.50] for us to realize
[1365.50 → 1366.68] even in our spiritual birth
[1366.68 → 1367.52] there's a sense in which
[1367.52 → 1369.90] it is all grace.
[1370.88 → 1371.62] You know, I grew up
[1371.62 → 1373.10] in this catechism class
[1373.10 → 1373.92] and my teacher emphasized
[1373.92 → 1375.00] over and over again
[1375.00 → 1375.88] this reformed distinctive
[1375.88 → 1376.88] that I think is so important
[1376.88 → 1377.28] and that is
[1377.28 → 1378.34] we come to faith
[1378.34 → 1379.94] by grace
[1379.94 → 1382.02] through faith
[1382.02 → 1383.68] in Jesus
[1383.68 → 1385.10] which is the result
[1385.10 → 1385.64] of the Spirit.
[1386.12 → 1386.84] I think it's so important
[1386.84 → 1387.44] to recognize that
[1387.44 → 1388.18] our spiritual birth
[1388.18 → 1389.58] we just gotta stand back
[1389.58 → 1390.58] put our arms up
[1390.58 → 1391.82] and say thank you, Christ.
[1392.52 → 1393.48] Thank you Holy Spirit.
[1393.48 → 1394.34] Thank you, Father
[1394.34 → 1395.30] for what you have done
[1395.30 → 1396.68] because I was probably
[1396.68 → 1397.98] not headed anywhere near this
[1397.98 → 1399.28] and you did your work in me.
[1399.36 → 1400.24] The spiritual regeneration
[1400.24 → 1402.22] is all your work.
[1402.56 → 1403.26] Thank you, Christ.
[1408.98 → 1410.34] John wants us to see
[1410.34 → 1412.08] as Jesus tells this story
[1412.08 → 1413.40] that Nicodemus
[1413.40 → 1414.00] doesn't just need
[1414.00 → 1414.72] a few ideas
[1414.72 → 1415.96] doesn't just need
[1415.96 → 1416.74] to tweak some of what
[1416.74 → 1417.42] he already believes
[1417.42 → 1417.98] about Jesus.
[1418.56 → 1419.60] He needs to be reborn
[1419.60 → 1421.28] as does every person.
[1422.02 → 1422.42] Jesus says
[1422.42 → 1423.12] you can't see
[1423.12 → 1424.02] and you can't enter
[1424.02 → 1424.48] this kingdom
[1424.48 → 1425.94] unless the Spirit
[1425.94 → 1427.08] of the living God
[1427.08 → 1428.34] opens your eyes
[1428.34 → 1429.62] makes you reborn
[1429.62 → 1430.70] so you see Christ
[1430.70 → 1431.80] for who he is
[1431.80 → 1432.80] and all the rest.
[1434.30 → 1435.54] And now I want to show us
[1435.54 → 1436.26] how this is connected
[1436.26 → 1437.78] to the most famous passage
[1437.78 → 1438.80] in the Bible
[1438.80 → 1439.28] and that is
[1439.28 → 1440.04] John 3.16
[1440.04 → 1440.78] I'll read it again.
[1441.54 → 1442.14] John's summary
[1442.14 → 1443.02] after this whole story
[1443.02 → 1443.86] of Nicodemus and Jesus
[1443.86 → 1444.20] saying
[1444.20 → 1445.90] for God so loved
[1445.90 → 1446.54] the world
[1446.54 → 1447.26] that he gave
[1447.26 → 1448.48] his one and only son
[1448.48 → 1449.96] that whoever believes
[1449.96 → 1450.36] in him
[1450.36 → 1451.48] will not perish
[1451.48 → 1453.90] but have eternal life.
[1454.22 → 1454.70] In verse 17
[1454.70 → 1455.34] I'll just read it for you.
[1455.56 → 1456.40] For God did not send
[1456.40 → 1457.28] his son into the world
[1457.28 → 1458.18] to condemn it
[1458.18 → 1459.88] but to save the world
[1459.88 → 1460.86] through him.
[1461.34 → 1462.14] And that for John
[1462.14 → 1462.66] that's it.
[1462.88 → 1463.94] That's the whole story
[1463.94 → 1465.76] summarized right there.
[1466.82 → 1467.56] And I love
[1467.56 → 1468.80] so many dimensions of this.
[1468.86 → 1469.18] First
[1469.18 → 1470.06] it's not just humans
[1470.06 → 1470.58] God's after
[1470.58 → 1471.46] it's the whole world
[1471.46 → 1473.22] and what compels God.
[1474.20 → 1475.34] love.
[1476.96 → 1477.86] Love is what
[1477.86 → 1479.08] compels God
[1479.08 → 1479.88] to create this world.
[1480.08 → 1480.98] Love is what's
[1480.98 → 1481.46] behind him
[1481.46 → 1482.64] placing his image bearers
[1482.64 → 1483.60] humans in this creation
[1483.60 → 1484.24] to enjoy
[1484.24 → 1485.02] develop
[1485.02 → 1485.94] and flourish in it.
[1486.34 → 1487.08] It's love
[1487.08 → 1488.06] that drives God
[1488.06 → 1489.64] to preserve his world
[1489.64 → 1490.08] even
[1490.08 → 1491.18] when humans
[1491.18 → 1492.44] rebelliously sin
[1492.44 → 1493.08] against him.
[1494.16 → 1495.08] It's love
[1495.08 → 1495.80] that compels
[1495.80 → 1496.40] the father
[1496.40 → 1497.86] to send his only
[1497.86 → 1499.86] begotten son
[1499.86 → 1501.00] to redeem
[1501.00 → 1501.96] forgive
[1501.96 → 1503.50] and restore.
[1504.20 → 1505.32] It's love.
[1506.14 → 1506.74] And one of my favourite
[1506.74 → 1507.92] passages in the book
[1507.92 → 1508.38] of Romans
[1508.38 → 1509.18] is Romans 5
[1509.18 → 1509.46] 5
[1509.46 → 1509.86] where it says
[1509.86 → 1511.34] the love of God
[1511.34 → 1512.74] has been poured
[1512.74 → 1514.12] into our hearts
[1514.12 → 1515.74] by the Holy Spirit.
[1516.98 → 1518.08] This project
[1518.08 → 1519.20] is love.
[1520.80 → 1522.00] And did you notice
[1522.00 → 1523.62] the expansive invitation?
[1523.82 → 1524.62] Many commentators say
[1524.62 → 1525.50] the most offensive thing
[1525.50 → 1526.10] to Nicodemus
[1526.10 → 1526.54] and other Jews
[1526.54 → 1527.36] would have been this part
[1527.36 → 1529.32] whoever believes.
[1530.06 → 1530.38] You know Jews
[1530.38 → 1531.42] had a pretty narrow view
[1531.42 → 1531.96] of salvation.
[1532.08 → 1533.12] It was mostly Jewish people
[1533.12 → 1534.42] maybe a few outsiders
[1534.42 → 1535.44] but they saw salvation
[1535.44 → 1535.88] as theirs.
[1536.22 → 1536.58] And Jesus
[1536.58 → 1537.30] or John
[1537.30 → 1537.96] here is saying
[1537.96 → 1538.96] whoever believes
[1538.96 → 1540.46] in him
[1540.46 → 1541.04] will not perish
[1541.04 → 1541.90] but have eternal life.
[1542.06 → 1542.56] Nicodemus?
[1542.80 → 1543.02] Yup.
[1543.58 → 1544.50] The Samaritan woman
[1544.50 → 1545.26] at the well
[1545.26 → 1546.78] who's far from the faith?
[1547.16 → 1547.52] Yup.
[1548.52 → 1549.58] Paul the murderer
[1549.58 → 1550.08] of Christians?
[1550.70 → 1551.06] Yup.
[1551.50 → 1552.90] Matthew the collaborator
[1552.90 → 1554.18] with the Roman tax collectors?
[1554.84 → 1555.28] Yup.
[1555.66 → 1556.04] You?
[1557.04 → 1557.48] Yup.
[1557.98 → 1558.34] Me?
[1558.84 → 1559.20] Yup.
[1559.20 → 1560.28] Your neighbour?
[1561.00 → 1561.84] The kid of the class
[1561.84 → 1562.58] that you don't like?
[1562.98 → 1563.34] Yup.
[1563.76 → 1564.58] Your co-worker?
[1565.34 → 1565.76] Yup.
[1566.52 → 1568.64] Whoever believes in him
[1568.64 → 1569.98] will not perish
[1569.98 → 1571.38] but have everlasting life.
[1572.14 → 1573.00] And the operative word
[1573.00 → 1573.62] you can imagine
[1573.62 → 1574.38] is that word
[1574.38 → 1575.32] believe.
[1576.02 → 1577.08] And I'll just highlight here
[1577.08 → 1579.14] there's a mystery
[1579.14 → 1580.42] in this passage.
[1580.48 → 1581.22] Actually there's a mystery
[1581.22 → 1581.88] in the Christian faith
[1581.88 → 1582.78] that I'll just open you up to
[1582.78 → 1583.84] that pastors struggle with
[1583.84 → 1585.10] and have written many books about.
[1585.58 → 1586.00] And that is
[1586.00 → 1586.70] that this passage
[1586.70 → 1587.84] Jesus seemed to be saying
[1587.84 → 1589.40] you can't enter the kingdom
[1589.40 → 1590.34] unless the spirit
[1590.34 → 1591.16] opens your eyes.
[1591.48 → 1592.50] And then John is saying here
[1592.50 → 1593.96] whoever believes.
[1594.50 → 1595.32] And there's a sense in which
[1595.32 → 1596.86] everyone who comes to faith in Jesus
[1596.86 → 1598.00] must believe.
[1598.06 → 1599.20] Has a response.
[1600.34 → 1601.40] But that response
[1601.40 → 1602.62] is made possible
[1602.62 → 1603.48] by the Holy Spirit.
[1603.94 → 1604.88] And how those fit together?
[1605.28 → 1605.96] Different traditions
[1605.96 → 1606.48] land differently
[1606.48 → 1607.18] but you can bring that
[1607.18 → 1607.76] to your small groups.
[1607.82 → 1608.22] You can bring that
[1608.22 → 1608.90] to your dinner table.
[1609.20 → 1609.92] It's a beautiful thing
[1609.92 → 1610.58] to reflect on
[1610.58 → 1612.26] how it's always the work of God
[1612.26 → 1614.12] that always invites a response.
[1614.52 → 1614.86] Belief.
[1615.26 → 1615.92] Work of the spirit.
[1615.92 → 1617.76] Amen.
[1618.76 → 1619.58] But I want to highlight
[1619.58 → 1620.38] that that work believe
[1620.38 → 1621.02] is not you know
[1621.02 → 1621.72] as western people
[1621.72 → 1622.66] we think that's just an idea
[1622.66 → 1624.28] to sort of ascend our minds to.
[1624.52 → 1625.38] But that is not at all
[1625.38 → 1625.76] what this is.
[1625.80 → 1626.62] It's not just like an idea
[1626.62 → 1627.22] to accept.
[1627.36 → 1628.98] When John says believe
[1628.98 → 1630.58] he means trust.
[1631.10 → 1631.58] In fact I think
[1631.58 → 1632.46] the most literal reading
[1632.46 → 1633.10] of the Greek here
[1633.10 → 1634.48] is to entrust ourselves
[1634.48 → 1635.00] to Jesus.
[1635.66 → 1636.18] And that is to say
[1636.18 → 1637.32] you stake your whole life
[1637.32 → 1637.80] on Jesus.
[1638.36 → 1639.06] It's not just this thing
[1639.06 → 1639.68] you have over here
[1639.68 → 1640.00] in your life.
[1640.10 → 1641.22] It's the whole of your life
[1641.22 → 1642.36] now is organized around
[1642.36 → 1643.18] and made possible
[1643.18 → 1644.48] and given meaning
[1644.48 → 1646.24] by Jesus Christ
[1646.24 → 1647.26] dead and risen
[1647.26 → 1648.84] reigning over creation.
[1649.18 → 1649.72] Without Jesus
[1649.72 → 1650.72] it all crumbles.
[1652.18 → 1652.50] Believe.
[1653.78 → 1654.18] Trust.
[1656.44 → 1657.30] And Nicodemus
[1657.30 → 1658.06] has now got to
[1658.06 → 1659.16] sort that out.
[1659.40 → 1659.78] And don't miss
[1659.78 → 1660.48] the promise too.
[1660.74 → 1661.62] Whoever believes in him
[1661.62 → 1663.38] shall not perish
[1663.38 → 1665.82] but have everlasting life.
[1665.92 → 1666.32] Jesus says
[1666.32 → 1666.98] whoever believes
[1666.98 → 1667.80] to those whose eyes
[1667.80 → 1668.54] are open to the kingdom
[1668.54 → 1669.56] you get the kingdom of God
[1669.56 → 1670.50] you get to live eternally
[1670.50 → 1671.06] you get to live
[1671.06 → 1671.82] in the presence of God
[1671.82 → 1673.34] you get all of it
[1673.34 → 1675.32] by the work of Jesus
[1675.32 → 1676.64] through the work
[1676.64 → 1677.20] of the spirit
[1677.20 → 1678.30] through faith.
[1680.06 → 1680.82] Now here's where
[1680.82 → 1681.42] I get to the question
[1681.42 → 1682.38] that a junior youth asked.
[1683.12 → 1684.10] This is a perfect question.
[1684.16 → 1684.76] You know what the question was?
[1685.48 → 1686.68] What happens to Nicodemus?
[1687.40 → 1688.30] If you pay close attention
[1688.30 → 1689.04] to this passage
[1689.04 → 1690.40] Nicodemus approaches Jesus
[1690.40 → 1691.40] Jesus says some stuff
[1691.40 → 1692.68] that really makes
[1692.68 → 1693.68] Nicodemus confused
[1693.68 → 1694.86] and then John speaks
[1694.86 → 1696.04] the most famous verse
[1696.04 → 1696.32] you know
[1696.32 → 1696.96] for God so loved.
[1697.06 → 1697.48] You're like okay
[1697.48 → 1699.02] well what happens next?
[1699.54 → 1700.28] Does Nicodemus
[1700.28 → 1701.66] go back to his Jewish council
[1701.66 → 1702.26] and say hey guys
[1702.26 → 1703.26] this guy's legit
[1703.26 → 1704.08] and he's got this thing
[1704.08 → 1704.66] about being reborn
[1704.66 → 1706.20] that's going to blow your minds?
[1706.88 → 1707.44] We don't know.
[1708.46 → 1709.14] But here's something
[1709.14 → 1710.28] I learned for the first time
[1710.28 → 1711.16] myself this week.
[1711.22 → 1711.82] You ready for this?
[1712.06 → 1713.32] Nicodemus does show up
[1713.32 → 1714.94] in the Gospel of John.
[1715.00 → 1715.36] Do you know where?
[1715.44 → 1716.02] Anyone know where?
[1717.86 → 1718.72] He shows up
[1718.72 → 1720.00] after the crucifixion of Jesus
[1720.00 → 1721.02] and this is the most
[1721.02 → 1722.42] intriguing story to me.
[1723.12 → 1724.78] So as Jesus is crucified
[1724.78 → 1725.40] he dies
[1725.40 → 1727.64] two guys go up to Pilate
[1727.64 → 1728.66] and they ask
[1728.66 → 1729.72] to bury the body.
[1729.72 → 1731.06] Joseph of Arimathea
[1731.06 → 1732.88] and Nicodemus
[1732.88 → 1734.66] and Pilate says
[1734.66 → 1735.24] have at her.
[1735.78 → 1736.46] And this is just
[1736.46 → 1737.24] I want to say
[1737.24 → 1737.64] at the outset
[1737.64 → 1739.06] Nicodemus never makes
[1739.06 → 1740.18] a verbal statement of faith
[1740.18 → 1740.68] so I don't want you
[1740.68 → 1741.70] to read too far into this
[1741.70 → 1743.24] but a lot of authors say
[1743.24 → 1744.12] this activity
[1744.12 → 1745.16] this is the activity
[1745.16 → 1746.50] of a devoted follower.
[1747.52 → 1747.76] Okay?
[1748.56 → 1749.48] So first
[1749.48 → 1751.32] Nicodemus goes to do something
[1751.32 → 1752.64] that is very debasing
[1752.64 → 1753.04] like
[1753.04 → 1754.68] I have no idea
[1754.68 → 1755.24] what this is like
[1755.24 → 1755.94] but imagine taking
[1755.94 → 1757.02] a body off of a cross
[1757.02 → 1757.76] and burying it
[1757.76 → 1759.62] that's a very humiliating task
[1759.62 → 1760.24] and I'm told that
[1760.24 → 1761.38] only slaves at that time
[1761.38 → 1761.76] did that.
[1762.02 → 1762.80] So Nicodemus is saying
[1762.80 → 1763.94] I want to be close to Jesus
[1763.94 → 1765.06] I don't want to do this work
[1765.06 → 1765.42] of a slave
[1765.42 → 1766.98] because I have reverence
[1766.98 → 1767.66] for this body.
[1768.96 → 1769.24] Moreover
[1769.24 → 1770.44] think about the context
[1770.44 → 1771.96] right before Jesus' crucifixion
[1771.96 → 1772.76] who ran away?
[1773.62 → 1774.36] All the disciples.
[1775.26 → 1776.14] And now Nicodemus
[1776.14 → 1777.16] who in our passage
[1777.16 → 1778.78] is meeting Jesus in secret
[1778.78 → 1779.36] out of fear
[1779.36 → 1780.12] for the consequences
[1780.12 → 1782.02] now he's out in the open
[1782.02 → 1783.44] with Jesus' body.
[1784.22 → 1784.90] At the very time
[1784.90 → 1785.60] everyone's running away
[1785.60 → 1786.20] Nicodemus is like
[1786.20 → 1786.58] you know what?
[1786.64 → 1787.78] I'm not that concerned anymore.
[1788.50 → 1789.12] I'm not that concerned
[1789.12 → 1789.78] about what people think
[1789.78 → 1790.30] what they say
[1790.30 → 1790.90] what it means
[1790.90 → 1791.58] for my friendship
[1791.58 → 1792.22] and my relationship
[1792.22 → 1793.00] with the ruling council
[1793.00 → 1794.54] I'm going to do this act.
[1795.70 → 1796.44] And the final thing
[1796.44 → 1797.02] that really catches
[1797.02 → 1797.72] people's attention
[1797.72 → 1799.22] is Nicodemus came
[1799.22 → 1800.52] with a hundred pounds
[1800.52 → 1801.24] of spices.
[1802.42 → 1803.44] A hundred pounds.
[1804.36 → 1804.96] And someone who knows
[1804.96 → 1805.60] a lot more about
[1805.60 → 1806.34] burial practices
[1806.34 → 1807.70] in this time says
[1807.70 → 1809.12] this is not just any burial
[1809.12 → 1811.20] this is a burial fit
[1811.20 → 1812.38] for a king.
[1812.38 → 1815.76] And maybe
[1815.76 → 1817.04] just maybe
[1817.04 → 1818.66] as Nicodemus
[1818.66 → 1819.48] held that body
[1819.48 → 1820.30] and he prepared it
[1820.30 → 1820.80] for burial
[1820.80 → 1822.76] he remembered back
[1822.76 → 1823.52] to that conversation
[1823.52 → 1824.04] with Jesus
[1824.04 → 1825.18] who at the end
[1825.18 → 1825.80] of their dialogue
[1825.80 → 1827.34] his final words is
[1827.34 → 1828.96] the son of man
[1828.96 → 1830.40] must be lifted
[1830.40 → 1832.44] that everyone
[1832.44 → 1833.34] who believes
[1833.34 → 1835.38] may have eternal life.
[1837.64 → 1838.50] Let's pray.
[1838.50 → 1845.84] Father I thank you
[1845.84 → 1846.52] for this story.
[1848.48 → 1849.14] I thank you
[1849.14 → 1849.86] for the questions
[1849.86 → 1851.36] we get to wrestle with
[1851.36 → 1852.12] that come out of it.
[1853.68 → 1854.36] I thank you
[1854.36 → 1854.74] for the way
[1854.74 → 1855.66] that your Holy Spirit
[1855.66 → 1857.22] brings about new birth.
[1859.30 → 1860.08] And Lord I want to pray
[1860.08 → 1861.10] even at this moment
[1861.10 → 1861.68] for those of us
[1861.68 → 1862.14] who are struggling
[1862.14 → 1862.66] right now
[1862.66 → 1864.34] who've got those
[1864.34 → 1864.92] big questions
[1864.92 → 1865.46] rattling around
[1865.46 → 1865.86] their mind
[1865.86 → 1866.50] about what it means
[1866.50 → 1867.10] to be reborn
[1867.10 → 1868.40] what the gospel
[1868.40 → 1868.92] is about.
[1870.02 → 1870.78] And I pray
[1870.78 → 1871.84] that we as a church
[1871.84 → 1872.72] would be engaging
[1872.72 → 1873.42] those questions
[1873.42 → 1875.02] being patient
[1875.02 → 1876.16] with anyone we know
[1876.16 → 1877.40] our loved ones
[1877.40 → 1878.02] our friends
[1878.02 → 1878.70] our co-workers
[1878.70 → 1880.40] who are really hard
[1880.40 → 1881.56] asking those hard questions.
[1881.76 → 1882.34] I pray that we'd have
[1882.34 → 1882.80] the wisdom.
[1884.46 → 1885.08] Lord I pray
[1885.08 → 1886.02] what Dan shared earlier
[1886.02 → 1886.74] would be true for us
[1886.74 → 1887.26] that we would have
[1887.26 → 1888.04] a posture
[1888.04 → 1889.66] that demonstrates
[1889.66 → 1890.28] the gospel
[1890.28 → 1892.52] that we would speak
[1892.52 → 1894.26] and we would live
[1894.26 → 1896.08] the love of Jesus Christ
[1896.08 → 1896.68] for the world.
[1897.10 → 1898.48] to that end
[1898.48 → 1899.36] would you fill us
[1899.36 → 1900.30] with your Holy Spirit
[1900.30 → 1902.00] would you send us
[1902.00 → 1903.10] out to make Christ known
[1903.10 → 1904.12] and would you work
[1904.12 → 1904.90] through us
[1904.90 → 1906.60] to wake many people
[1906.60 → 1907.60] up to the good news
[1907.60 → 1908.34] of the gospel.
[1909.14 → 1909.36] Amen.
[1911.74 → 1913.38] I invite you to stand now
[1913.38 → 1914.40] as we sing
[1914.40 → 1916.14] the words of John 3.16.
[1916.14 → 1916.30] Amen.
[1916.30 → 1916.36] Amen.
[1916.36 → 1916.42] Amen.
[1916.42 → 1916.46] Amen.
[1916.46 → 1916.50] Amen.
[1916.50 → 1916.92] Amen.
[1916.92 → 1916.96] Amen.
[1916.96 → 1917.06] Amen.
[1917.06 → 1917.12] Amen.
[1917.12 → 1917.18] Amen.
[1917.18 → 1917.22] Amen.
[1917.22 → 1917.26] Amen.
[1917.26 → 1917.28] Amen.
[1917.28 → 1917.32] Amen.
[1917.32 → 1918.32] Amen.
[1918.32 → 1918.36] Amen.
