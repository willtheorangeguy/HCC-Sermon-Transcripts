[0.00 → 5.04] Good morning.
[7.94 → 11.36] Also congratulations to Pete and Joanna.
[12.08 → 15.26] The young, their daughter, was married yesterday too,
[15.42 → 17.32] so congratulations to them as well.
[20.18 → 23.82] We are in this series on unity,
[24.52 → 25.94] and it's an important series.
[26.38 → 27.58] It's always an important series,
[27.58 → 31.88] but it somewhat feels even more so
[31.88 → 36.36] in times when there are lots of examples of disunity.
[38.04 → 40.32] And last week, Pastor Dave's sermon,
[40.50 → 43.76] he mentioned how Christians in Paul's day
[43.76 → 45.18] were influenced by their world,
[46.44 → 50.72] and how Christ's influence showed up then in their behaviour,
[52.24 → 56.66] referring to this gap between what we say we believe
[56.66 → 59.54] and how we behave and live.
[60.32 → 62.14] And that's a troubling gap.
[64.46 → 69.08] I have been troubled by the behaviour of some Christians.
[69.40 → 72.84] Too many behave as rudely and unchristlike
[72.84 → 75.72] as some of their secular counterparts.
[77.72 → 81.16] I read a book, Andy Stanley, the latest book,
[81.16 → 82.58] and he says this.
[82.64 → 84.24] He says, difference is inevitable.
[85.18 → 85.82] And it is.
[86.36 → 87.74] But division is a choice.
[89.90 → 91.42] And yet when I look around,
[91.64 → 94.96] I see way too much division in way too many places.
[96.08 → 98.26] And it feels like something's gone wrong,
[98.34 → 100.00] and instead of being salt and light,
[100.80 → 103.68] we take our cues too often from the world
[103.68 → 105.30] and the surrounding culture,
[105.30 → 107.94] and we forget what it means to be Christian.
[109.44 → 110.78] In the first century,
[111.12 → 112.82] the word Christian was a political term,
[112.90 → 113.78] not a religious one.
[115.14 → 116.10] You had different groups.
[116.22 → 116.98] You had, for example,
[117.12 → 120.50] the Herodian, followers of Herod.
[120.56 → 122.40] You had the Devonian,
[122.82 → 124.24] the followers of Nero.
[125.20 → 125.96] Lots of groups.
[126.18 → 128.44] And you had Christians, followers of Jesus.
[128.44 → 132.40] And it really meant you were kind of anti-Roman.
[133.26 → 135.24] Not because of what they believed, really,
[135.30 → 137.16] but because of who they chose to obey.
[138.10 → 138.74] And so, you know,
[138.90 → 139.96] the Romans at that time would have said,
[140.04 → 140.88] go ahead, pick a god.
[140.94 → 141.80] There's a lot of them.
[142.76 → 144.22] But you have only one king.
[145.54 → 146.36] Worship Christ,
[147.10 → 148.08] but obey Caesar.
[149.90 → 151.86] And often no one asked Christians
[151.86 → 153.00] if they were Christians.
[153.12 → 154.38] They were accused of it.
[154.94 → 157.46] It was evident by their behaviour.
[158.44 → 159.88] And what behaviour was that?
[160.88 → 162.12] Well, I'm going to get into that.
[162.96 → 163.90] Too often,
[164.00 → 165.02] I think one of the problems is,
[165.08 → 166.92] too often we've reduced our faith
[166.92 → 168.48] to simply belief statements.
[170.78 → 171.06] You know?
[172.26 → 175.48] And then Jesus is somehow part of a belief system
[175.48 → 176.62] that we hold on to.
[176.94 → 178.62] Not one who we obey
[178.62 → 180.72] in every aspect of our lives
[180.72 → 183.56] because he is lord of every aspect of our lives.
[184.14 → 186.40] And in this ancient culture of Rome,
[186.74 → 187.74] that worship winning,
[187.74 → 189.38] the message of Jesus
[189.38 → 191.26] was considered weak,
[191.54 → 192.66] even offensive.
[193.30 → 194.80] And you can read lots of examples of that.
[195.14 → 198.76] But Jesus' other first value system
[198.76 → 200.00] appealed to many people.
[200.82 → 202.68] Christians, with their behaviour,
[203.06 → 203.44] for example,
[203.60 → 206.24] refused to abandon the sick.
[207.62 → 210.14] They deemed that slaves
[210.14 → 211.72] were brothers and sisters.
[212.34 → 213.82] They didn't necessarily bring down slavery,
[213.82 → 216.02] but they deemed that they were brothers and sisters.
[216.74 → 219.18] Men and women were considered equal,
[219.32 → 221.80] even though it probably wasn't always practice as such.
[222.26 → 224.20] And that's why Paul wrote things like,
[224.74 → 227.26] in Christ there's neither Jew nor Greek,
[227.38 → 228.34] neither male nor female,
[228.56 → 231.40] neither slave nor free.
[232.18 → 232.38] Right?
[232.38 → 234.64] Because that's the ideal of following Christ.
[234.64 → 235.96] And these people,
[236.28 → 237.50] by their behaviour again,
[237.80 → 241.64] they would adopt abandoned children
[241.64 → 242.82] left to die,
[243.06 → 245.46] which was a fairly common practice.
[246.46 → 248.92] We can hardly imagine that.
[249.70 → 250.44] But, yeah,
[250.52 → 251.94] it was a fairly common practice.
[252.28 → 253.16] Let me read you a letter
[253.16 → 255.18] dated June 17th,
[255.18 → 256.82] 1 B.C.
[256.96 → 257.94] And this illustrates
[257.94 → 259.82] the detached indifference
[259.82 → 262.12] that many ancients had toward newborns.
[262.42 → 263.06] And the letter was written
[263.06 → 263.96] by a Roman soldier
[263.96 → 266.58] stationed in Alexandria to his wife.
[266.64 → 267.38] And this is what he writes.
[267.70 → 270.10] Know that I am still in Alexandria,
[270.22 → 271.26] and don't worry if they,
[271.34 → 271.72] the army,
[271.86 → 272.48] wholly set out.
[272.64 → 274.14] I am staying in Alexandria.
[274.70 → 276.50] I ask you and entreat you,
[276.70 → 278.16] take care of the child,
[278.30 → 279.08] which she's expecting.
[279.74 → 281.68] And if I receive my pay soon,
[281.72 → 282.92] I will send it up to you.
[283.54 → 284.06] Above all,
[284.06 → 285.18] if you bear a child
[285.18 → 286.14] and it's a male,
[286.72 → 287.34] let it be.
[288.04 → 288.90] But if it's a female,
[289.98 → 290.62] cast it out.
[292.62 → 294.88] And that wasn't particularly unusual.
[296.30 → 296.70] Later,
[297.92 → 300.60] infanticide was a crime
[300.60 → 302.16] under Augustine
[302.16 → 303.98] and more Christian leaders
[303.98 → 307.00] because Christians behaved differently.
[307.48 → 308.60] This came to be.
[309.04 → 310.66] Rescuing and raising
[310.66 → 313.06] these abandoned children
[313.06 → 314.56] was something that
[314.56 → 317.18] these people had to do
[317.18 → 319.14] because their true king said,
[319.24 → 321.44] and I quote out of John 13,
[321.92 → 322.90] where Jesus says,
[323.78 → 324.30] love one,
[324.34 → 325.74] a new commandment I give you,
[326.14 → 327.06] love one another
[327.06 → 328.62] as I have loved you,
[328.72 → 330.74] so you must love one another.
[331.70 → 332.14] By this,
[332.28 → 333.02] everyone will know
[333.02 → 334.06] that you are my disciples
[334.06 → 336.24] if you love one another.
[336.24 → 337.90] And somehow,
[338.54 → 340.62] that swept through the empire
[340.62 → 342.60] and then swept through the world.
[344.40 → 345.70] Some of you would remember
[345.70 → 347.02] the old song,
[347.16 → 348.50] they'll know we are Christians
[348.50 → 349.40] by our love.
[350.52 → 352.52] Not so much by what we say,
[352.66 → 354.12] but more by what we do.
[355.58 → 356.70] Let me say this to you.
[356.74 → 358.12] You can't love people
[358.12 → 360.30] you demonize or attack.
[362.26 → 363.74] Ed Settler puts it this way,
[363.74 → 365.36] you can't hate people
[365.36 → 366.22] and engage them
[366.22 → 367.02] with the gospel
[367.02 → 368.22] at the same time.
[370.48 → 372.24] Jesus didn't come
[372.24 → 373.86] to help any particular group
[373.86 → 375.38] succeed with their thing.
[376.42 → 377.46] He just looked at the gospel,
[377.60 → 377.74] right?
[377.98 → 378.48] Jesus was,
[378.66 → 379.30] there was an attempt
[379.30 → 379.82] to draw him
[379.82 → 380.50] into a discussion
[380.50 → 381.30] about taxes.
[381.42 → 382.96] There were a lot of heavy taxes
[382.96 → 384.10] on a lot of poor people
[384.10 → 385.40] and they were pretty upset,
[385.50 → 386.04] rightly upset
[386.04 → 386.76] by these taxes.
[386.84 → 387.60] They tried to draw Jesus
[387.60 → 388.16] into the argument.
[388.58 → 388.76] You know,
[389.06 → 390.14] do we have to pay taxes
[390.14 → 390.54] to Caesar?
[390.72 → 391.36] And Jesus says,
[391.40 → 392.06] here, show me a coin.
[392.12 → 392.72] Whose head's on it?
[392.72 → 393.08] Caesar's.
[393.08 → 393.66] Okay, you go ahead,
[393.72 → 394.18] pay your taxes.
[394.40 → 395.80] He didn't get drawn into it.
[396.70 → 397.98] He didn't get drawn
[397.98 → 399.18] into those kingdom arguments
[399.18 → 400.24] because he came
[400.24 → 401.34] to build a kingdom
[401.34 → 402.94] that was not of this world.
[403.20 → 405.54] One that defines power
[405.54 → 406.76] differently than the rest
[406.76 → 407.14] of the world,
[407.22 → 408.26] which defines it
[408.26 → 409.36] as winning at all costs.
[410.72 → 412.40] Christ's kingdom invites you,
[413.12 → 414.20] and Luke says it this way,
[414.26 → 415.34] or Jesus says it in Luke
[415.34 → 415.90] this way,
[416.64 → 417.86] whoever wants to be
[417.86 → 418.62] my disciple,
[419.24 → 421.12] must deny themselves,
[422.56 → 423.84] take up their cross daily,
[424.52 → 425.40] and follow me.
[428.22 → 429.40] If you think about that
[429.40 → 430.74] and reflect on that,
[430.82 → 431.84] what would that mean to you?
[432.96 → 433.88] Jesus also said
[433.88 → 434.90] in Matthew 6,
[434.96 → 435.20] he said,
[435.48 → 437.02] no one can serve two masters.
[437.10 → 437.78] I might add to that,
[438.00 → 439.38] no one can serve two kingdoms,
[439.68 → 440.22] or three kingdoms,
[440.30 → 440.92] or whatever it might be.
[440.92 → 442.22] Either you will hate the one
[442.22 → 442.80] and love the other,
[443.02 → 443.92] you'll be devoted to one
[443.92 → 444.70] or despise the other.
[444.70 → 446.24] You cannot serve both God
[446.24 → 446.68] and money,
[446.88 → 447.98] or anything else,
[448.18 → 449.18] for that matter.
[449.50 → 450.42] Jesus is Lord,
[450.78 → 451.90] or he isn't.
[453.88 → 454.66] Andy Stanley,
[455.20 → 456.14] and I quote,
[456.28 → 457.18] and hopefully that slide
[457.18 → 457.78] comes up here,
[458.20 → 458.76] says this,
[458.94 → 460.88] we must refuse to play
[460.88 → 461.62] by the rules
[461.62 → 462.30] of the kingdoms
[462.30 → 463.26] of this world.
[463.84 → 465.18] We must choose instead
[465.18 → 466.20] the way of Jesus,
[466.94 → 468.32] the way of the cross.
[469.02 → 470.36] In the shadow of the cross,
[470.36 → 471.84] we lose our right
[471.84 → 473.04] to cancel anybody.
[473.04 → 474.68] We are to forgive
[474.68 → 476.24] as we've been forgiven.
[476.66 → 477.52] We are to let our light
[477.52 → 478.44] shine in such a way
[478.44 → 479.84] that people see our good works,
[479.94 → 480.86] hear our good words,
[480.90 → 481.88] and look up
[481.88 → 483.74] and glorify our Father in Heaven.
[484.96 → 485.98] Inflammatory rhetoric
[485.98 → 486.74] may win us
[486.74 → 488.08] more social media followers,
[488.48 → 489.36] but it damages
[489.36 → 490.08] our influence
[490.08 → 490.68] with those
[490.68 → 491.70] we are called
[491.70 → 492.82] to reach.
[496.98 → 498.24] Jesus was inviting
[498.24 → 499.60] his first century audience
[499.60 → 501.10] to repent,
[501.10 → 502.98] to turn away
[502.98 → 503.56] from that
[503.56 → 504.48] which was actually
[504.48 → 505.24] harming them.
[506.10 → 506.96] Maybe they didn't know
[506.96 → 507.74] it was harming them.
[508.46 → 509.56] I think we're in the same boat.
[510.02 → 510.82] To set aside
[510.82 → 512.52] their preconceived notions
[512.52 → 513.60] about the Father,
[513.74 → 514.38] about one another,
[514.50 → 515.24] about the world,
[515.46 → 516.38] and he invited them
[516.38 → 517.00] into something
[517.00 → 518.12] a lot better,
[518.36 → 519.66] to believe in him
[519.66 → 520.48] and then to centre
[520.48 → 521.32] their lives
[521.32 → 523.04] around him.
[524.64 → 526.04] A kingdom of heart
[526.04 → 526.92] and conscience.
[527.26 → 528.08] A kingdom that would
[528.08 → 528.84] flip the scripts
[528.84 → 529.48] of the kingdoms
[529.48 → 529.96] of the world.
[530.22 → 530.96] A kingdom where
[530.96 → 532.20] he would lay down
[532.20 → 534.04] his life for the world
[534.04 → 535.12] and he would require
[535.12 → 535.64] his followers
[535.64 → 536.20] to lay down
[536.20 → 536.84] their lives
[536.84 → 537.64] for one another.
[539.76 → 541.82] A new commandment
[541.82 → 542.62] I give you.
[543.22 → 544.16] Love one another
[544.16 → 546.00] like I loved you.
[546.44 → 547.06] And he said this
[547.06 → 547.86] just before he would
[547.86 → 548.78] go to the cross.
[549.90 → 552.10] Love like Jesus.
[554.16 → 555.14] Think about that.
[555.88 → 556.04] You know,
[556.08 → 557.16] we might say,
[557.22 → 557.42] oh yeah,
[557.60 → 558.84] of course we're supposed
[558.84 → 559.34] to love.
[559.78 → 561.94] Love like Jesus.
[563.06 → 565.02] Exactly like Jesus.
[566.10 → 566.62] How are you doing
[566.62 → 567.04] with that?
[569.58 → 570.10] You know,
[570.16 → 571.10] I picture Jesus
[571.10 → 574.20] coming to his followers
[574.20 → 576.08] at that time
[576.08 → 577.48] to someone like Matthew
[577.48 → 578.72] who was a tax collector
[578.72 → 581.32] and he would have been
[581.32 → 581.64] aided.
[582.38 → 582.48] Right?
[583.08 → 584.54] And saying this,
[584.94 → 585.32] Matthew,
[585.66 → 587.10] remember when we met.
[587.10 → 588.42] Yes, Rabbi,
[588.58 → 588.98] I remember.
[589.70 → 591.14] Remember what you were doing.
[591.90 → 592.68] Of course, Rabbi.
[593.06 → 593.82] Everybody remembers
[593.82 → 594.44] what I was doing.
[594.68 → 595.68] I used the authority
[595.68 → 596.24] of Rome
[596.24 → 597.52] as a cover to steal
[597.52 → 598.32] from my own people.
[599.68 → 600.12] Do you remember
[600.12 → 601.04] what I said to you?
[601.74 → 602.20] Yeah, Rabbi,
[602.32 → 603.12] you invited me
[603.12 → 603.84] to follow you.
[604.10 → 604.68] In those days,
[604.78 → 605.70] people were nervous
[605.70 → 606.48] if they thought
[606.48 → 607.48] I was following them.
[607.48 → 609.12] Matthew,
[609.54 → 611.20] extend that same grace
[611.20 → 612.14] I extended to you
[612.14 → 613.28] to everyone you meet
[613.28 → 614.46] for the rest of your life.
[614.84 → 616.20] Love as I have loved you.
[616.80 → 617.28] Nathaniel,
[617.62 → 619.02] remember the day we met.
[619.30 → 620.12] Remember what you said
[620.12 → 620.66] about me.
[620.92 → 621.84] Can anything good
[621.84 → 622.90] come from Nazareth?
[623.20 → 624.76] You dissed my town,
[624.90 → 625.80] my family,
[625.96 → 626.86] my childhood friends,
[626.98 → 628.78] but I invited you anyway.
[629.74 → 631.00] Extend the same grace
[631.00 → 631.50] and forgiveness
[631.50 → 632.96] to everybody you meet.
[632.96 → 637.34] and love as I have loved you.
[638.78 → 639.94] And one by one,
[640.34 → 642.84] Jesus could have taken them back
[642.84 → 643.88] to a moment
[643.88 → 645.50] and reminded them
[645.50 → 646.60] of patience
[646.60 → 648.14] or kindness and grace
[648.14 → 649.94] that he had extended to them.
[650.28 → 651.46] And now he looks you
[651.46 → 652.54] and I in the eyes
[652.54 → 653.16] and he says,
[653.46 → 655.10] remember how I loved you
[655.10 → 656.62] even when,
[657.34 → 657.80] and you go ahead
[657.80 → 658.46] and fill in the blank,
[659.50 → 660.20] even when,
[660.76 → 661.10] and he says,
[661.10 → 662.10] now go love like that.
[662.96 → 666.48] This is the unifying,
[666.68 → 667.58] identifying mark
[667.58 → 668.20] of his followers
[668.20 → 669.50] of his church
[669.50 → 671.86] against which all other behaviour
[671.86 → 672.58] of the followers
[672.58 → 673.80] would be measured.
[674.20 → 675.08] Think about that.
[676.18 → 677.12] By this,
[677.98 → 678.52] this,
[678.88 → 680.14] everyone will know
[680.14 → 681.08] you are my disciples.
[681.28 → 681.58] This,
[681.92 → 683.72] if you love one another,
[683.92 → 686.22] that is the measuring statement.
[689.52 → 690.12] This,
[690.12 → 692.24] how we treat,
[692.70 → 693.56] how we talk about,
[693.64 → 694.48] how we respond to,
[694.54 → 695.60] how we care for one another.
[695.94 → 697.68] Not merely what we claim to believe,
[697.98 → 698.42] but how,
[698.70 → 700.76] or how well we argue our positions.
[701.02 → 702.56] That's not the point here.
[703.88 → 705.68] That's not the entering point.
[706.26 → 707.52] Love as Jesus,
[707.70 → 708.14] our King,
[708.22 → 708.86] defines it
[708.86 → 710.00] and display it
[710.00 → 711.44] as he displayed it.
[712.72 → 713.94] Let me give you another quote.
[715.72 → 716.80] There's this theologian,
[716.86 → 717.46] Don Carson,
[717.46 → 718.48] and he writes this,
[718.48 → 720.20] I suspect
[720.20 → 721.26] that one reason
[721.26 → 721.98] why there are
[721.98 → 723.38] so many exhortations
[723.38 → 724.18] in the New Testament
[724.18 → 724.84] for Christians
[724.84 → 725.74] to love one another
[725.74 → 726.92] is because it's not
[726.92 → 728.06] an easy thing to do.
[729.20 → 729.90] And he continues,
[730.46 → 731.02] Ideally,
[731.56 → 732.00] however,
[732.10 → 732.88] the church itself
[732.88 → 733.58] is not made up
[733.58 → 734.76] of natural friends.
[735.14 → 735.64] It's made up
[735.64 → 736.56] of natural enemies.
[737.36 → 738.40] What binds us together
[738.40 → 739.72] is not common education,
[739.92 → 740.42] common race,
[740.56 → 741.42] common income levels,
[741.56 → 742.34] common politics,
[742.72 → 743.58] common nationality,
[743.72 → 744.40] common accents,
[744.86 → 745.42] common jobs,
[745.46 → 746.00] or anything else
[746.00 → 746.48] of that sort.
[746.84 → 747.66] Christians come together
[747.66 → 748.56] not because they form
[748.56 → 749.86] a natural co-location,
[750.12 → 750.92] but because they've all
[750.92 → 752.74] been saved by Jesus Christ
[752.74 → 753.64] and owe him
[753.64 → 754.74] a common allegiance.
[755.02 → 755.70] Ken was saying that
[755.70 → 756.50] and this is what he said.
[757.18 → 758.10] And then this next statement
[758.10 → 758.54] is gold.
[759.06 → 759.88] In light of this
[759.88 → 760.98] common allegiance,
[761.18 → 762.06] in light of the fact
[762.06 → 763.04] that we have all been loved
[763.04 → 763.90] by Jesus himself,
[764.06 → 765.32] they commit themselves
[765.32 → 768.08] to doing what he says.
[768.74 → 769.58] He commands them
[769.58 → 770.30] to love one another
[770.30 → 771.30] and in this light,
[771.56 → 772.10] they are a band
[772.10 → 773.00] of natural enemies
[773.00 → 773.62] who love one another
[773.62 → 774.44] for Jesus' sake.
[774.44 → 778.24] I love that transcends
[778.24 → 779.26] denominations.
[779.38 → 780.32] I love that transcends
[780.32 → 781.04] political boundaries
[781.04 → 781.90] and so forth and so on.
[782.66 → 783.92] And some of you
[783.92 → 784.24] might be thinking,
[784.32 → 784.72] oh, come on,
[784.74 → 786.08] this all sounds so naive.
[786.22 → 786.86] Love one another.
[786.96 → 787.38] Come on.
[787.66 → 788.62] It's not how the game
[788.62 → 789.52] is played in this world.
[791.52 → 792.14] So what?
[793.62 → 795.24] I'm not suggesting
[795.24 → 796.68] that Jesus' new command
[796.68 → 798.20] should govern our behaviour,
[798.56 → 799.22] our responses,
[799.38 → 799.98] or our tones.
[800.40 → 801.90] Jesus, our king, is.
[801.90 → 803.92] He said it.
[806.02 → 806.30] You know,
[806.96 → 808.32] I picture Jesus
[808.32 → 809.10] and his disciples
[809.10 → 809.78] entering Jerusalem
[809.78 → 810.56] on Passover
[810.56 → 812.56] before the cross
[812.56 → 814.08] and they had all kinds
[814.08 → 814.66] of opponents
[814.66 → 815.70] waiting for them, right,
[815.76 → 816.52] from the temple
[816.52 → 817.70] and the Roman government.
[818.32 → 819.48] And Jesus is talking
[819.48 → 819.92] to the disciples
[819.92 → 821.16] and the best he comes up with,
[821.42 → 823.10] love like I love.
[823.94 → 825.56] And that's the plan
[825.56 → 826.30] going forward.
[826.54 → 827.72] That's the big kingdom
[827.72 → 828.70] battle cry.
[828.86 → 830.06] Love like I love.
[830.06 → 833.20] And I picture that Caesar
[833.20 → 834.46] hears this
[834.46 → 835.88] or Caiaphas
[835.88 → 837.24] or Herod.
[837.78 → 837.94] You know,
[838.56 → 839.52] we're doomed.
[839.64 → 840.50] They're going to love
[840.50 → 841.14] one another.
[843.30 → 844.96] I'm shaking in my boots.
[845.06 → 845.76] They're going to love
[845.76 → 846.42] one another.
[848.50 → 849.48] But let me ask you this.
[849.76 → 850.66] Where's the Roman Empire
[850.66 → 851.10] today?
[854.28 → 855.24] You see the mighty
[855.24 → 855.88] Roman Empire
[855.88 → 857.02] working around today?
[857.24 → 857.62] No, no,
[857.62 → 858.32] they're not there anymore.
[858.32 → 858.80] Why?
[858.94 → 860.78] Because this Nazarene cult
[860.78 → 862.70] outlives the empire
[862.70 → 864.44] and it shapes the world
[864.44 → 866.50] anew forever.
[867.66 → 868.08] I get it.
[868.22 → 869.20] It's in progress.
[869.70 → 870.62] A lot of work to do yet,
[870.68 → 871.78] but it's a true story.
[871.98 → 872.72] It's a story
[872.72 → 873.62] that we find ourselves in.
[873.96 → 874.84] And this love
[874.84 → 875.62] one another culture
[875.62 → 876.08] of the church
[876.08 → 877.60] stood in sharp contrast
[877.60 → 878.52] to the bite
[878.52 → 879.00] and devour
[879.00 → 879.72] one another culture
[879.72 → 880.18] of the world.
[880.32 → 881.56] And it still should.
[881.56 → 886.28] I'm troubled
[886.28 → 887.28] when I see
[887.28 → 888.90] Christians involved
[888.90 → 889.36] in the bite
[889.36 → 889.72] and devour
[889.72 → 890.46] culture of the world
[890.46 → 891.58] that is around today.
[891.94 → 892.58] And what struck
[892.58 → 893.20] the ancient world
[893.20 → 894.04] as pathetic
[894.04 → 895.58] eventually becomes
[895.58 → 896.86] to be seen
[896.86 → 897.44] as inviting
[897.44 → 898.74] and in the end
[898.74 → 899.68] is contagious.
[901.12 → 903.20] That's our story.
[904.84 → 905.82] That's the gospel.
[905.82 → 908.32] One that requires us
[908.32 → 909.20] to love one another
[909.20 → 909.76] like Jesus
[909.76 → 910.98] no matter what the politics,
[911.44 → 913.24] no matter what the issue is,
[913.42 → 914.48] we love like Jesus.
[914.74 → 915.54] Even those
[915.54 → 917.60] we might call enemies.
[918.14 → 919.48] And we love in word
[919.48 → 920.60] and we love in deed
[920.60 → 922.00] and it gets reflected
[922.00 → 923.44] in our media posts,
[923.58 → 924.42] in our discussions,
[924.88 → 925.70] in our demeanour,
[925.98 → 926.72] in our sermons,
[926.94 → 927.76] in our meetings.
[928.36 → 928.94] And there will be
[928.94 → 929.68] no slander
[929.68 → 930.66] or blame
[930.66 → 931.90] or stereotyping
[931.90 → 933.02] or cancelling
[933.02 → 934.28] or shaming
[934.28 → 935.72] or gossiping.
[935.82 → 940.44] It's not complicated.
[941.60 → 942.86] But it is costly.
[944.24 → 945.32] Jesus never said,
[945.66 → 946.52] by this everyone
[946.52 → 947.54] will know you are my disciples.
[947.66 → 948.36] If you believe
[948.36 → 949.40] really correctly
[949.40 → 950.86] and argue it's perfect.
[952.18 → 953.74] He didn't say that.
[954.58 → 955.80] The world will know
[955.80 → 956.72] who we are
[956.72 → 957.50] and whose kingdom
[957.50 → 958.04] we represent
[958.04 → 959.20] by how we treat,
[959.40 → 959.94] respond to,
[960.06 → 960.32] serve,
[960.40 → 961.02] and talk about
[961.02 → 961.80] and forgive
[961.80 → 962.86] one another.
[964.32 → 965.80] Because we will have
[965.80 → 967.14] to forgive
[967.14 → 967.92] one another
[967.92 → 968.90] now and then.
[970.70 → 971.50] Anyone out there
[971.50 → 972.34] require forgiveness
[972.34 → 972.88] now and then?
[974.08 → 974.40] Maybe?
[974.72 → 974.94] Maybe?
[978.34 → 979.14] Paul describes
[979.14 → 979.48] a little bit
[979.48 → 980.24] what that looks like.
[980.72 → 982.08] Look at Colossians 3
[982.08 → 982.48] with me.
[983.84 → 984.78] Colossians 3
[984.78 → 988.82] where Paul writes this
[988.82 → 990.68] and he starts off
[990.68 → 990.90] with this.
[991.00 → 991.14] Okay.
[991.52 → 991.80] Therefore,
[991.90 → 992.84] it's God's chosen people.
[992.94 → 993.20] All right.
[993.52 → 993.90] Holy,
[994.08 → 994.50] dearly loved.
[994.56 → 995.06] There we go.
[995.32 → 995.46] Now,
[995.52 → 995.96] what do we do?
[996.42 → 997.64] Clothe yourselves.
[997.90 → 998.06] Okay,
[998.20 → 999.32] it's deliberate.
[999.48 → 1000.38] It's an act you do.
[1000.80 → 1001.58] Clothe yourself
[1001.58 → 1002.70] with compassion,
[1003.26 → 1003.64] kindness,
[1004.02 → 1004.48] humility,
[1005.02 → 1005.38] gentleness,
[1005.38 → 1006.10] and patience.
[1006.60 → 1008.82] Bear with each other.
[1009.30 → 1010.44] Forgive one another
[1010.44 → 1011.12] if any of you
[1011.12 → 1011.88] has a grievance.
[1012.02 → 1012.64] What kind of grievance?
[1012.70 → 1013.42] Any grievance
[1013.42 → 1014.28] against someone.
[1014.80 → 1015.68] Forgive as the Lord
[1015.68 → 1016.50] forgave you
[1016.50 → 1018.04] and over all these virtues.
[1018.30 → 1019.14] Put on love.
[1019.26 → 1020.24] Notice it's an act again.
[1020.34 → 1021.06] Put on love
[1021.06 → 1021.80] which binds them
[1021.80 → 1022.24] all together
[1022.24 → 1023.72] in perfect unity.
[1025.32 → 1027.34] Notice all the changed behaviour.
[1029.04 → 1030.72] Because Jesus is Lord
[1030.72 → 1031.62] and King,
[1031.84 → 1033.14] it changes how we live
[1033.14 → 1035.00] in every part of our lives.
[1035.24 → 1035.78] And the world
[1035.78 → 1036.74] becomes a better place
[1036.74 → 1037.50] because of what
[1037.50 → 1039.46] Christ followers believe,
[1039.58 → 1040.42] but even more so,
[1040.68 → 1042.52] how they behave.
[1045.78 → 1047.82] And this self-serving
[1047.82 → 1049.86] and self-preserving posture
[1049.86 → 1050.84] that we see around us
[1050.84 → 1052.30] has no place
[1052.30 → 1053.54] in our communities.
[1055.10 → 1055.90] No place.
[1057.46 → 1059.02] And it's why Paul said,
[1059.54 → 1060.14] what good,
[1060.18 → 1061.00] elsewhere in scripture,
[1061.12 → 1061.58] what good is it
[1061.58 → 1062.78] if someone claims that faith
[1062.78 → 1063.54] but have no deeds?
[1063.60 → 1064.44] And the answer is no good.
[1064.70 → 1065.68] Faith that doesn't do good
[1065.68 → 1066.34] is no good.
[1067.32 → 1067.98] It just isn't.
[1069.22 → 1070.82] You need to display
[1070.82 → 1071.70] kindness
[1071.70 → 1073.02] and compassion
[1073.02 → 1073.74] and humility
[1073.74 → 1074.38] and gentleness
[1074.38 → 1075.00] and patience
[1075.00 → 1078.08] and forgiveness
[1078.08 → 1079.90] because that's love.
[1083.56 → 1084.74] We've all been horrified.
[1084.94 → 1086.20] It's been prayed about already.
[1086.58 → 1087.60] But we've all been horrified
[1087.60 → 1088.30] about what we saw
[1088.30 → 1089.42] on the news in Texas
[1089.42 → 1091.30] and just before that
[1091.30 → 1091.84] in Buffalo.
[1095.90 → 1096.72] Same story
[1096.72 → 1097.72] seemed to repeat itself
[1097.72 → 1098.36] all over and over again.
[1098.48 → 1099.56] It's an awful thing.
[1100.02 → 1100.78] You remember
[1100.78 → 1101.72] Dylan Roof.
[1102.60 → 1103.10] Maybe some of you
[1103.10 → 1103.48] remember it
[1103.48 → 1104.32] from the news.
[1104.44 → 1105.36] He was a young man
[1105.36 → 1106.34] who killed nine
[1106.34 → 1106.98] African-American
[1106.98 → 1107.94] church parishioners
[1107.94 → 1109.46] who had welcomed them
[1109.46 → 1110.28] into the community.
[1110.76 → 1111.76] And he killed them
[1111.76 → 1112.76] because they were black,
[1113.80 → 1114.86] just like the guy
[1114.86 → 1115.46] did in Buffalo.
[1115.46 → 1118.52] Two years later,
[1119.24 → 1120.52] the Dylan Roof trial
[1120.52 → 1121.28] was happening
[1121.28 → 1123.96] and this mass murderer
[1123.96 → 1125.32] was forgiven
[1125.32 → 1127.68] by each of the families
[1127.68 → 1129.02] who lost loved ones
[1129.02 → 1130.48] to his hate.
[1132.86 → 1134.18] Let me read to you
[1134.18 → 1135.80] what one person said to him.
[1137.44 → 1138.86] Anthony Thompson,
[1139.66 → 1140.72] whose wife Mira
[1140.72 → 1141.92] was shot and killed
[1141.92 → 1143.24] at point-blank range,
[1143.24 → 1145.12] looked his wife's murderer
[1145.12 → 1145.96] in the eyes
[1145.96 → 1147.16] and said,
[1148.16 → 1148.98] I forgive you
[1148.98 → 1150.44] and my family
[1150.44 → 1151.16] forgives you,
[1151.32 → 1152.22] but we would like
[1152.22 → 1153.82] to take this opportunity
[1153.82 → 1155.10] to ask you
[1155.10 → 1155.88] to repent,
[1156.72 → 1157.56] to repent,
[1158.10 → 1159.08] to confess
[1159.08 → 1160.38] and give your life
[1160.38 → 1160.98] to the one
[1160.98 → 1161.94] who matters most,
[1162.74 → 1163.24] Christ.
[1166.46 → 1168.00] Mr. Thompson
[1168.00 → 1170.24] invited Dylan Roof
[1170.24 → 1172.18] to make a profound decision
[1172.18 → 1173.58] that would enable them
[1173.58 → 1175.74] to share heaven together.
[1181.34 → 1182.68] I think a lot of people
[1182.68 → 1183.80] would have rather heard
[1183.80 → 1185.62] them say to him,
[1186.46 → 1187.02] Dylan Roof
[1187.02 → 1187.56] to burn in hell.
[1191.78 → 1193.50] How could Anthony Thompson
[1193.50 → 1194.24] say this?
[1195.74 → 1196.74] But he went on,
[1197.74 → 1198.96] we would like to take
[1198.96 → 1199.68] this opportunity
[1199.68 → 1200.34] to ask you,
[1200.64 → 1201.90] confess and give your life
[1201.90 → 1202.46] to the one
[1202.46 → 1203.14] who matters most,
[1203.48 → 1203.82] Christ,
[1204.04 → 1206.38] so he can change you.
[1206.64 → 1208.40] He can change your ways
[1208.40 → 1209.48] no matter what happened
[1209.48 → 1209.88] to you
[1209.88 → 1211.30] and you'll be okay.
[1213.00 → 1213.94] You'll be okay.
[1219.02 → 1220.18] Unbelievable behaviour.
[1223.84 → 1224.82] Another example,
[1225.22 → 1226.54] American gymnast
[1226.54 → 1227.50] Rachel Hollander
[1227.50 → 1228.34] was the first woman
[1228.34 → 1229.40] to publicly accuse
[1229.40 → 1230.58] U.S. gymnastics team
[1230.58 → 1232.32] doctor Larry NASCAR
[1232.32 → 1233.66] of sexual assault.
[1233.98 → 1234.96] NASCAR had repeatedly
[1234.96 → 1236.10] engaged in horrific
[1236.10 → 1237.10] and humiliating
[1237.10 → 1238.04] sexual behaviour
[1238.04 → 1239.12] and after that
[1239.12 → 1240.62] over 265 other women
[1240.62 → 1241.24] came forward
[1241.24 → 1242.26] with their stories
[1242.26 → 1243.76] of similar abuse.
[1246.20 → 1247.82] And Rachel Hollander
[1247.82 → 1248.54] was the first one
[1248.54 → 1249.34] to come forward
[1249.34 → 1251.40] to state these charges
[1251.40 → 1252.64] and she was the last
[1252.64 → 1253.62] to speak in the courtroom.
[1253.62 → 1255.04] And here's what she said
[1255.04 → 1255.96] directly to NASCAR.
[1256.06 → 1257.04] Just picture that scene
[1257.04 → 1257.94] directly to NASCAR.
[1258.48 → 1259.00] He said,
[1259.26 → 1260.24] in our early hearings
[1260.24 → 1261.60] you brought your Bible
[1261.60 → 1262.40] into the courtroom
[1262.40 → 1263.56] and you have spoken
[1263.56 → 1264.78] of praying for forgiveness.
[1265.84 → 1267.14] And so it is on that basis
[1267.14 → 1268.20] that I appeal to you.
[1268.44 → 1269.18] If you have read
[1269.18 → 1270.52] that Bible that you carry
[1270.52 → 1272.02] you know the definition
[1272.02 → 1273.28] of sacrificial love
[1273.28 → 1275.24] portrayed is of God himself
[1275.24 → 1276.96] loving so sacrificially
[1276.96 → 1278.08] that he gave everything
[1278.08 → 1279.06] to pay the penalty
[1279.06 → 1281.14] for sin he did not commit.
[1281.14 → 1284.44] By his grace
[1284.44 → 1286.22] I too choose
[1286.22 → 1287.60] to love this way.
[1288.36 → 1289.54] Should you ever
[1289.54 → 1290.66] reach the point
[1290.66 → 1291.70] of truly facing
[1291.70 → 1292.48] what you have done
[1292.48 → 1294.34] the guilt will be crushing.
[1296.72 → 1298.08] But that's what makes
[1298.08 → 1299.54] the gospel so sweet
[1299.54 → 1301.10] because it extends
[1301.10 → 1302.32] grace and hope
[1302.32 → 1302.96] and mercy
[1302.96 → 1304.40] where none should be found.
[1304.94 → 1306.30] And it will be there for you.
[1307.18 → 1308.38] I pray you experience
[1308.38 → 1310.28] the soul crushing weight
[1310.28 → 1310.80] of guilt
[1310.80 → 1311.88] so you may someday
[1311.88 → 1313.72] experience true repentance
[1313.72 → 1314.94] and true forgiveness
[1314.94 → 1315.48] from God
[1315.48 → 1316.86] which you need far more
[1316.86 → 1318.12] than forgiveness from me
[1318.12 → 1319.30] though I extend that
[1319.30 → 1321.52] to you as well.
[1326.82 → 1327.70] And you can hear
[1327.70 → 1328.38] the silence
[1328.38 → 1329.50] in that courtroom
[1329.50 → 1333.00] and I can hear
[1333.00 → 1333.82] the voice of Jesus
[1333.82 → 1334.54] on the cross
[1334.54 → 1336.74] looking at the people
[1336.74 → 1337.72] who put him on the cross
[1337.72 → 1338.34] and saying Father
[1338.34 → 1338.86] forgive them
[1338.86 → 1339.30] they don't know
[1339.30 → 1339.76] what they're doing.
[1340.86 → 1341.78] They really don't get it.
[1345.78 → 1346.72] If the Hollander
[1346.72 → 1347.54] had spewed out
[1347.54 → 1348.62] years of pent-up venom
[1348.62 → 1349.46] no one would have
[1349.46 → 1349.94] blamed her.
[1350.34 → 1350.72] No one.
[1351.64 → 1352.82] But on that day
[1352.82 → 1354.12] Jesus was her Lord
[1354.12 → 1355.46] not her anger
[1355.46 → 1356.06] or pain.
[1356.36 → 1357.30] On that day
[1357.30 → 1358.02] her past
[1358.02 → 1358.92] didn't define her
[1358.92 → 1360.30] her Saviour did.
[1360.30 → 1364.38] and she came
[1364.38 → 1364.94] to forgive
[1364.94 → 1366.60] while justice
[1366.60 → 1367.48] was also served.
[1369.22 → 1370.42] She brought the kingdom
[1370.42 → 1371.70] into the courtroom.
[1373.70 → 1374.58] So when we hear
[1374.58 → 1375.02] the words
[1375.02 → 1375.36] forgive
[1375.36 → 1376.42] like Christ
[1376.42 → 1377.04] forgave you
[1377.04 → 1377.58] when we hear
[1377.58 → 1377.98] the words
[1377.98 → 1378.34] love
[1378.34 → 1379.06] like Christ
[1379.06 → 1379.54] loves you
[1379.54 → 1380.82] that's you
[1380.82 → 1383.30] somewhere.
[1383.30 → 1384.08] somewhere
[1384.08 → 1389.82] where do you
[1389.82 → 1390.50] need to forgive
[1390.50 → 1391.18] like Christ
[1391.18 → 1391.66] forgave you?
[1391.98 → 1392.36] Where do you
[1392.36 → 1393.04] need to love
[1393.04 → 1393.98] like Christ
[1393.98 → 1394.34] loves?
[1394.56 → 1395.20] Not just a
[1395.20 → 1395.82] little
[1395.82 → 1396.60] I love you
[1396.60 → 1396.94] no, no
[1396.94 → 1397.20] I know
[1397.20 → 1398.02] love like
[1398.02 → 1398.34] Christ
[1398.34 → 1398.50] loves
[1398.50 → 1399.20] when it
[1399.20 → 1399.68] hurts
[1399.68 → 1403.32] when it's
[1403.32 → 1403.68] hard.
[1409.18 → 1410.62] Put on
[1410.62 → 1411.38] kindness
[1411.38 → 1412.92] put on
[1412.92 → 1413.62] compassion
[1413.62 → 1414.94] put on
[1414.94 → 1415.58] humility
[1415.58 → 1416.88] put on
[1416.88 → 1417.50] gentleness
[1417.50 → 1418.66] put on
[1418.66 → 1419.30] patience
[1419.30 → 1420.52] bear with
[1420.52 → 1421.02] each other
[1421.02 → 1421.98] carry each
[1421.98 → 1422.36] other's
[1422.36 → 1422.60] burden
[1422.60 → 1423.68] that's what
[1423.68 → 1424.46] love looks
[1424.46 → 1424.80] like
[1424.80 → 1425.64] and forgive
[1425.64 → 1426.42] as the Lord
[1426.42 → 1427.28] forgave you
[1427.28 → 1428.20] because that's
[1428.20 → 1428.70] what God
[1428.70 → 1429.64] calls us
[1429.64 → 1430.30] to do.
[1434.54 → 1435.42] That's how
[1435.42 → 1436.56] we behave
[1436.56 → 1438.66] that's how
[1438.66 → 1439.04] we live
[1439.04 → 1439.42] life.
[1440.62 → 1445.44] you know
[1445.44 → 1445.64] what
[1445.64 → 1447.68] we all
[1447.68 → 1447.98] have these
[1447.98 → 1448.44] challenging
[1448.44 → 1448.94] moments
[1448.94 → 1455.54] somebody
[1455.54 → 1455.90] in the
[1455.90 → 1458.08] first service
[1458.08 → 1458.48] came and
[1458.48 → 1458.84] talked to me
[1458.84 → 1459.12] afterward
[1459.12 → 1459.46] about the
[1459.46 → 1459.68] sermon
[1459.68 → 1461.28] and this
[1461.28 → 1461.78] person has
[1461.78 → 1462.30] relatives in
[1462.30 → 1462.76] the states
[1462.76 → 1463.94] and some
[1463.94 → 1464.46] had posted
[1464.46 → 1465.28] some stuff
[1465.28 → 1467.24] about guns
[1467.24 → 1470.96] and she
[1470.96 → 1471.44] wanted to
[1471.44 → 1471.84] send a
[1471.84 → 1472.60] scathing
[1472.60 → 1473.40] rebuttal
[1473.40 → 1475.60] and an
[1475.60 → 1475.90] article
[1475.90 → 1478.90] and she
[1478.90 → 1479.18] said after
[1479.18 → 1479.52] hearing the
[1479.52 → 1479.90] sermon she
[1479.90 → 1480.52] decided to
[1480.52 → 1480.90] check her
[1480.90 → 1481.30] motive and
[1481.30 → 1481.60] she said why
[1481.60 → 1481.96] do I want
[1481.96 → 1482.24] to send
[1482.24 → 1482.64] this and
[1482.64 → 1483.14] she said I
[1483.14 → 1483.42] want to
[1483.42 → 1484.30] fight back
[1484.30 → 1487.78] she said
[1487.78 → 1488.10] after the
[1488.10 → 1488.38] sermon I'm
[1488.38 → 1488.64] not going
[1488.64 → 1488.90] to send
[1488.90 → 1489.16] it.
[1491.20 → 1491.50] Yay.
[1493.50 → 1494.06] A little
[1494.06 → 1494.40] victories.
[1495.74 → 1496.04] A little
[1496.04 → 1496.52] behaviour
[1496.52 → 1497.06] changes.
[1497.06 → 1497.40] Right.
[1497.40 → 1501.78] when you're
[1501.78 → 1502.04] in these
[1502.04 → 1502.90] moments and
[1502.90 → 1503.34] you want to
[1503.34 → 1504.20] take a
[1504.20 → 1504.94] swing back
[1504.94 → 1507.66] I get it
[1507.66 → 1508.32] we're not
[1508.32 → 1508.64] saying some
[1508.64 → 1508.86] of these
[1508.86 → 1509.28] issues aren't
[1509.28 → 1509.86] worth arguing
[1509.86 → 1511.34] it's posture
[1511.34 → 1512.20] it's tenor
[1512.20 → 1513.48] it's somehow
[1513.48 → 1514.44] if I'm speaking
[1514.44 → 1515.08] out of love
[1515.08 → 1515.86] what does that
[1515.86 → 1516.42] even look like
[1516.42 → 1517.18] and so ask
[1517.18 → 1517.78] yourself this
[1517.78 → 1518.86] question what
[1518.86 → 1519.60] would it look
[1519.60 → 1521.72] like to love
[1521.72 → 1522.40] this person or
[1522.40 → 1523.00] to love this
[1523.00 → 1523.68] group the way
[1523.68 → 1524.80] Christ loves
[1524.80 → 1525.14] them.
[1527.40 → 1529.26] what would
[1529.26 → 1529.74] that look
[1529.74 → 1530.26] like just
[1530.26 → 1531.34] think on that
[1531.34 → 1531.98] for a moment.
[1533.32 → 1533.92] I don't know
[1533.92 → 1534.58] about you but
[1534.58 → 1536.24] I've on
[1536.24 → 1537.18] occasion shot
[1537.18 → 1537.94] my mouth off
[1537.94 → 1538.24] and made
[1538.24 → 1538.88] things a whole
[1538.88 → 1539.54] lot worse.
[1540.90 → 1541.34] Maybe you
[1541.34 → 1541.84] have too.
[1545.68 → 1546.50] But I was
[1546.50 → 1547.24] so smart
[1547.24 → 1547.60] right.
[1550.92 → 1551.60] When you're
[1551.60 → 1552.62] not sure what
[1552.62 → 1553.34] to do or what
[1553.34 → 1554.60] to say ask
[1554.60 → 1555.68] yourself what
[1555.68 → 1556.62] does love
[1556.62 → 1557.80] require of
[1557.80 → 1558.10] me?
[1562.48 → 1562.92] Dan
[1562.92 → 1563.32] Hollander
[1563.32 → 1564.00] asked that.
[1566.36 → 1567.04] All those
[1567.04 → 1567.38] ones who
[1567.38 → 1567.82] lost their
[1567.82 → 1568.24] loved ones
[1568.24 → 1570.64] to that
[1570.64 → 1571.64] white supremacist
[1571.64 → 1572.74] asked the
[1572.74 → 1573.46] same question.
[1574.46 → 1575.34] What does
[1575.34 → 1577.02] love to require?
[1577.66 → 1578.56] Christ's love
[1578.56 → 1580.20] require of me.
[1580.20 → 1585.16] early on to
[1585.16 → 1585.88] follow Christ
[1585.88 → 1586.98] meant that the
[1586.98 → 1587.36] loved one
[1587.36 → 1587.90] another showed
[1587.90 → 1588.20] up in your
[1588.20 → 1588.60] behaviour.
[1589.92 → 1590.30] It still
[1590.30 → 1590.58] should.
[1590.82 → 1591.30] It stood in
[1591.30 → 1592.28] sharp contrast
[1592.28 → 1592.80] to the win
[1592.80 → 1593.28] at all cost
[1593.28 → 1593.86] culture around
[1593.86 → 1594.04] them.
[1596.94 → 1597.92] Imagine a
[1597.92 → 1599.70] world where
[1599.70 → 1600.40] people might
[1600.40 → 1601.26] be skeptical
[1601.26 → 1602.58] of what we
[1602.58 → 1603.36] believe but
[1603.36 → 1604.24] envious of how
[1604.24 → 1604.84] we treated one
[1604.84 → 1605.12] another.
[1607.94 → 1608.64] Wouldn't that be
[1608.64 → 1608.94] awesome?
[1610.20 → 1611.04] I mean I'd
[1611.04 → 1611.50] like them to
[1611.50 → 1612.24] believe as we
[1612.24 → 1612.92] believe too but
[1612.92 → 1613.74] wouldn't it be
[1613.74 → 1614.26] awesome if they
[1614.26 → 1615.62] wow you know I
[1615.62 → 1616.06] don't know if I
[1616.06 → 1616.92] see I don't agree
[1616.92 → 1617.62] with your statement
[1617.62 → 1618.50] man I see how you
[1618.50 → 1618.96] love each other
[1618.96 → 1620.46] that attracts me.
[1623.36 → 1624.06] We need to
[1624.06 → 1625.32] follow Jesus by
[1625.32 → 1626.64] loving and
[1626.64 → 1627.32] living like him.
[1630.26 → 1631.18] Paul goes on in
[1631.18 → 1632.08] Colossians 3 let me
[1632.08 → 1632.96] conclude with what
[1632.96 → 1633.68] he says next.
[1634.82 → 1635.76] Colossians 3 15
[1635.76 → 1636.48] through 17 he
[1636.48 → 1637.02] says let the
[1637.02 → 1637.76] peace of Christ
[1637.76 → 1638.28] rule in your
[1638.28 → 1640.16] hearts since as
[1640.16 → 1641.76] members of one
[1641.76 → 1643.30] body you were
[1643.30 → 1644.10] called to peace.
[1645.36 → 1646.62] That one body is
[1646.62 → 1647.26] all these
[1647.26 → 1648.70] denominations all
[1648.70 → 1649.64] these all these
[1649.64 → 1650.54] Christ followers
[1650.54 → 1651.36] all together right
[1651.36 → 1652.48] one body you are
[1652.48 → 1653.22] called to peace
[1653.22 → 1656.16] and be thankful
[1656.16 → 1658.14] let the message of
[1658.14 → 1659.14] Christ dwell in you
[1659.14 → 1660.16] richly as you
[1660.16 → 1661.14] teach and admonish
[1661.14 → 1661.76] one another with
[1661.76 → 1662.56] all wisdom through
[1662.56 → 1663.62] psalms and hymns and
[1663.62 → 1664.54] songs from the spirit
[1664.54 → 1665.74] singing to God with
[1665.74 → 1666.64] gratitude in your
[1666.64 → 1667.90] heart and whatever
[1667.90 → 1669.44] you do whether in
[1669.44 → 1670.14] word or in deed do
[1670.14 → 1670.70] it all in the name
[1670.70 → 1671.24] of the Lord Jesus
[1671.24 → 1672.06] giving thanks to
[1672.06 → 1672.58] God the Father
[1672.58 → 1673.32] through him.
[1674.76 → 1675.68] Members of one
[1675.68 → 1677.76] body we're in this
[1677.76 → 1678.84] together whether we
[1678.84 → 1679.40] like it or not.
[1680.60 → 1681.46] This is what
[1681.46 → 1683.20] unity is we can't do
[1683.20 → 1684.90] this alone and this
[1684.90 → 1686.68] love of Christ must
[1686.68 → 1688.20] show up in our lives
[1688.20 → 1689.44] together.
[1689.44 → 1689.56] prayer.
[1692.12 → 1692.92] Yeah at times there
[1692.92 → 1693.24] will be some
[1693.24 → 1694.96] admonishing there
[1694.96 → 1695.22] will be some
[1695.22 → 1696.84] teaching there will
[1696.84 → 1697.24] be a lot of
[1697.24 → 1698.78] singing lots and
[1698.78 → 1701.14] lots of gratitude and
[1701.14 → 1701.98] then Paul concludes
[1701.98 → 1702.92] and whatever you do
[1702.92 → 1703.76] so he covers all the
[1703.76 → 1704.48] bases you say well
[1704.48 → 1705.60] not this no whatever
[1705.60 → 1706.92] whatever you do
[1706.92 → 1708.16] you need to cover it
[1708.16 → 1708.88] all do it all for
[1708.88 → 1711.04] Jesus so you can live
[1711.04 → 1712.22] like Jesus.
[1713.70 → 1714.22] Let's pray.
[1714.22 → 1720.56] Lord God we come
[1720.56 → 1721.74] before you and we
[1721.74 → 1723.16] thank you, Father, for
[1723.16 → 1724.02] loving us so deeply.
[1725.64 → 1727.08] We thank you, Lord that
[1727.08 → 1729.62] you met us where we
[1729.62 → 1732.64] are with our messiness
[1732.64 → 1733.78] and our brokenness
[1733.78 → 1738.14] with our big opinions
[1738.14 → 1739.86] and our self
[1739.86 → 1741.42] justification and our
[1741.42 → 1743.80] argumentative tendencies
[1743.80 → 1746.22] tendencies and our
[1746.22 → 1747.32] tendencies to demonize
[1747.32 → 1748.34] others and Lord you
[1748.34 → 1749.38] met us, and you said
[1749.38 → 1750.78] listen let's just slow
[1750.78 → 1752.90] down here and know
[1752.90 → 1754.60] this I love you.
[1756.00 → 1757.86] I love you enough to
[1757.86 → 1759.86] face the cross, and I'm
[1759.86 → 1760.72] powerful enough to
[1760.72 → 1761.70] overcome that cross
[1761.70 → 1763.92] and overcome death and
[1763.92 → 1765.36] bring my kingdom about
[1765.36 → 1766.92] into its fullness so you
[1766.92 → 1767.80] can live in it and
[1767.80 → 1768.72] reflect that kingdom.
[1769.50 → 1770.62] Lord please forgive us
[1770.62 → 1772.24] when we forget to love
[1772.24 → 1772.92] like you do.
[1772.92 → 1774.36] When we forget to
[1774.36 → 1775.36] forgive as you forgive.
[1775.64 → 1777.00] When we forget to be
[1777.00 → 1778.18] like you when we think
[1778.18 → 1779.08] we just can shoot our
[1779.08 → 1780.16] mouths off however we
[1780.16 → 1780.64] see fit.
[1782.32 → 1783.22] Forgive us Lord.
[1785.00 → 1786.20] And make us more like
[1786.20 → 1787.28] you through the power of
[1787.28 → 1788.04] your Holy Spirit.
[1788.92 → 1789.58] In Jesus name.
