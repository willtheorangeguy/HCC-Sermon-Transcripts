[2739.06 --> 2747.06]  I was a prophet and knew that God would promise you that he would put one of his descendants
[2747.06 --> 2748.06]  to his throne.
[2748.06 --> 2756.06]  I'm talking about the resurrection of Christ that was not abandoned in the sepulchre, whose
[2756.06 --> 2761.06]  body did not suffer from decomposition.
[2761.06 --> 2768.24]  My name is Victor and I'm reading from Tagalog.

[2911.78 --> 2913.78]  Thank you.
[2913.78 --> 2915.78]  Good evening, everyone.
[2915.78 --> 2919.78]  My name is Prince Thomas, and I'm one of the pastors at Pacific Community Church.
[2919.78 --> 2924.78]  And I'd like to invite you all to join me in praying for the Spirit's work in our city,
[2924.78 --> 2928.78]  in our churches, and in global advancement for God's mission around the world.
[2928.78 --> 2930.78]  So let us pray.
[2930.78 --> 2937.78]  Heavenly Father, we come before you right now recognizing, dear Jesus, that you are worthy of all praise.
[2937.78 --> 2941.78]  You are worthy of all honor. There is no one like you in heaven or in earth.
[2941.78 --> 2946.78]  And because of this, we sing forth our praises unto you. We lift up your name.
[2946.78 --> 2950.78]  We worship you in all that we do and all that we say.
[2950.78 --> 2956.78]  And right now, dear God, we come together as one local church body of separate churches, dear God,
[2956.78 --> 2962.78]  but one body in Christ Jesus, asking for your Spirit to move and to blow through the city of Surrey,
[2962.78 --> 2967.78]  to blow through the city of Cloverdale, to blow through Clayton, dear Jesus,
[2967.78 --> 2970.78]  so that men and women will come to know your name.
[2970.78 --> 2978.78]  We ask, dear God, that you remove every single force of opposition that may seek to act against your will taking place in our community.
[2978.78 --> 2987.78]  And we pray and we intercede and we ask, dear God, that your Holy Spirit will just come upon our land in a way that it has never had before,
[2987.78 --> 2995.78]  so that people will wonder what is happening in this place in Surrey where men and women are singing out their praises to Jesus
[2995.78 --> 2999.78]  in a time where other people are choosing to go away from him.
[2999.78 --> 3006.78]  May people in our communities, may people in our neighborhoods come to know you because of the Spirit's work in us, dear God.
[3006.78 --> 3010.78]  And for that to happen, dear Jesus, you've chosen to use human vessels.
[3010.78 --> 3018.78]  And so I pray that your Spirit will fall upon each and every single member of the body of Christ who lives in our community, oh God.
[3018.78 --> 3023.78]  We ask, dear God, that we will just tap in deeper into you, that we will seek your face more,
[3023.78 --> 3028.78]  so that your Spirit can do what you want to do and you can operate freely within us.
[3028.78 --> 3031.78]  May we be a bride that is pure and white before you.
[3031.78 --> 3036.78]  May you remove every single form of impurity from us, dear Jesus.
[3036.78 --> 3044.78]  We repent where we need to repent, and we come before you asking that your Holy Spirit will just operate within us in a manner
[3044.78 --> 3048.78]  and in a way that will lead to transformation taking place.
[3048.78 --> 3057.78]  We want to look back and say that within this context and within this time that we served and that we seek to worship you in this space,
[3057.78 --> 3060.78]  plenty people came to know Jesus.
[3060.78 --> 3062.78]  And that is why we are here.
[3062.78 --> 3067.78]  We are not being called by you just to go along, to get along, to create social clubs,
[3067.78 --> 3072.78]  but to be a space and a place where people can come and encounter the living God.
[3072.78 --> 3078.78]  And so right now, dear Jesus, I pray for all of the congregations that are here represented.
[3078.78 --> 3083.78]  You know all of them by name, and I ask, dear God, that your Holy Spirit will fill us all,
[3083.78 --> 3090.78]  that your Holy Spirit will start a revival through us all, that the embers of fire will burn within us, dear Jesus,
[3090.78 --> 3095.78]  that you will fall upon us in a manner that we have never experienced before.
[3095.78 --> 3102.78]  I ask, heavenly Father, that when you think and we ponder upon your goodness, that it will lead us, dear Jesus,
[3102.78 --> 3107.78]  not to be in a space where we just take for granted the things that you have done for us,
[3107.78 --> 3111.78]  but that we will seek after you with hunger, that we will seek after you with passion,
[3111.78 --> 3119.78]  and we pray and we intercede that by your Spirit's moving within us, that the whole community will be transformed.
[3119.78 --> 3124.78]  And right now, we pray for Canada at large, dear Jesus, this beautiful country that we call home.
[3124.78 --> 3128.78]  We ask and we pray that your Spirit will blow across our land,
[3128.78 --> 3132.78]  and we ask and we pray, dear Jesus, that through your Spirit's work,
[3132.78 --> 3137.78]  the people around the globe will be able to see that something different is happening in Canada.
[3137.78 --> 3143.78]  May a revival be bubbled up within this nation. May men and women come to know you across this nation.
[3143.78 --> 3147.78]  May this place be an environment where people come and see,
[3147.78 --> 3150.78]  hey, I want to experience what is happening in the land of Canada,
[3150.78 --> 3155.78]  so that your gospel message can be sent throughout the entire world.
[3155.78 --> 3160.78]  We pray for the global missions work that we are all a part of in our different local churches.
[3160.78 --> 3163.78]  We ask, dear God, that you will be with our international workers.
[3163.78 --> 3166.78]  May they be filled with the Spirit to the brim.
[3166.78 --> 3171.78]  We ask that your Holy Spirit, dear God, will take away every single force of opposition
[3171.78 --> 3175.78]  that may act against the advancement of your cause around the world.
[3175.78 --> 3180.78]  We recognize that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but they are spiritual, dear Jesus.
[3180.78 --> 3186.78]  And so we come before you operating in the power of the Holy Spirit in the spiritual realm,
[3186.78 --> 3188.78]  asking you to war on our behalf.
[3188.78 --> 3194.78]  And so we just pray, dear God, that your Spirit will just flow across this globe,
[3194.78 --> 3198.78]  so people will come to know you.
[3198.78 --> 3204.78]  Dear Jesus, you know what has been difficult for the missionaries in this time,
[3204.78 --> 3207.78]  in the different contexts in which they serve.
[3207.78 --> 3214.78]  I ask, dear God, that you will provide all that they will need to be able to serve you effectively.
[3214.78 --> 3218.78]  We ask, dear Jesus, that you will stir our hearts in our local churches here,
[3218.78 --> 3221.78]  to think of our missionaries and to pray for them.
[3221.78 --> 3225.78]  We ask, oh God, that you will bless them with the resources that are needed,
[3225.78 --> 3228.78]  so that evangelization can take place.
[3228.78 --> 3230.78]  We do not bat away from that.
[3230.78 --> 3233.78]  We want to see people come to know you as the living God.
[3233.78 --> 3236.78]  And we recognize that one of the ways in which that takes place
[3236.78 --> 3240.78]  is through men and women going to the frontier lands around the globe,
[3240.78 --> 3243.78]  communicating your message of hope.
[3243.78 --> 3246.78]  And so, dear Jesus, we praise you.
[3246.78 --> 3248.78]  We lift you up.
[3248.78 --> 3251.78]  And we ask that on this day of Pentecost,
[3251.78 --> 3255.78]  that your Spirit will fall upon us in a way that we have never experienced before.
[3255.78 --> 3260.78]  In Jesus' holy and precious name, amen.
[3260.78 --> 3263.78]  And so, at this point in time,
[3263.78 --> 3267.78]  we would like to invite you and the congregation to join us in prayer as well.
[3267.78 --> 3270.78]  And so, Pastor Dave is going to be going around with a microphone.
[3270.78 --> 3275.78]  And so, if you are feeling the light of the Spirit to offer prayer maybe for our city,
[3275.78 --> 3279.78]  for our church, for the global missions, for Canada,
[3279.78 --> 3281.78]  something that the Spirit has placed upon your heart,
[3281.78 --> 3285.78]  we encourage you to pray out as one body here.
[3285.78 --> 3288.78]  And so, Pastor Dave will be going around with the microphone for you guys to do that.
[3288.78 --> 3304.78]  If you would like to join us in prayer, just raise your hand, and I will bring the mic towards you.
[3304.78 --> 3319.78]  Creator God, we just, as we wrap up a week of 24-7 prayer,
[3319.78 --> 3325.78]  I just want to worship and praise you for the hearts that you touched, the lives that you called.
[3325.78 --> 3329.78]  And Father, I just pray for revival.
[3329.78 --> 3336.78]  I pray that you would fan the flames that have started today and started days, weeks, years before.
[3336.78 --> 3338.78]  Lord, I pray that you would give your church a boldness,
[3338.78 --> 3342.78]  that your church would rise up and that we, as your people, would rise up.
[3342.78 --> 3346.78]  Give us boldness, Lord, in our schools, in our workplaces, in our homes.
[3346.78 --> 3351.78]  Help us to lead our families well, and let us be shining lights in this dark world, Jesus.
[3351.78 --> 3354.78]  And to your glory we pray.
[3370.78 --> 3377.78]  And Father, at that 24-7 prayer room this past week, you know how a number of pastors gathered together for an hour,
[3377.78 --> 3379.78]  and how rich that time of prayer was.
[3379.78 --> 3384.78]  And we praise you, Lord, that there are pastors in this city who are not about competition, but about collaboration,
[3384.78 --> 3389.78]  who seek to work together for your glory, for the good of all of our churches.
[3389.78 --> 3393.78]  So we praise you for that spirit of cooperation and brotherhood.
[3393.78 --> 3397.78]  And we pray that you would help the pastors of this city to be faithful to their calling,
[3397.78 --> 3400.78]  that you would help them also be fruitful in their work,
[3400.78 --> 3403.78]  that you would bless our congregations with faithful under-shepherds,
[3403.78 --> 3405.78]  that we would all look then to you.
[3405.78 --> 3409.78]  Jesus, the good shepherd, the great shepherd who laid down his life for us as sheep.
[3409.78 --> 3410.78]  We praise you.
[3410.78 --> 3411.78]  Hmm, Jesus.
[3411.78 --> 3417.78]  First of all, I want to acknowledge what I sense happening in the room.
[3417.78 --> 3420.78]  I've never felt this way before.
[3420.78 --> 3423.78]  Started at the second service and I felt it here.
[3423.78 --> 3424.78]  My head is still burning.
[3424.78 --> 3431.78]  I don't know if someone else is feeling that, but that's the glory of God.
[3431.78 --> 3439.78]  And CL Lewis says, if you want to see a revival, get on fire for Jesus, and people will come to see you born.
[3439.78 --> 3446.78]  So I'm going to pray that God ignite us with His fire.
[3446.78 --> 3452.78]  And get us away from our comfort zones.
[3452.78 --> 3454.78]  So that we'll begin to burn for Jesus.
[3454.78 --> 3456.78]  That's all it takes.
[3456.78 --> 3458.78]  You burn for Jesus.
[3458.78 --> 3459.78]  You burn for Jesus.
[3459.78 --> 3461.78]  And you burn for Jesus.
[3461.78 --> 3462.78]  That's all it takes.
[3462.78 --> 3464.78]  You burn for Jesus.
[3464.78 --> 3467.78]  You burn for Jesus.
[3467.78 --> 3468.78]  That's all it takes.
[3468.78 --> 3470.78]  You burn for Jesus.
[3470.78 --> 3473.78]  And people will come to watch you born.
[3473.78 --> 3482.78]  So Father, in your name, the name that is above all names.
[3482.78 --> 3486.78]  You are the fourth man in the fiery furnace.
[3486.78 --> 3490.78]  You are the shame of Nebuchadnezzar.
[3490.78 --> 3494.78]  You are the ancient of days.
[3494.78 --> 3496.78]  You are the lily of the valley.
[3496.78 --> 3499.78]  You are the bright and the morning sun.
[3499.78 --> 3501.78]  You are the omnipotent God.
[3501.78 --> 3503.78]  You are the omnipotent God.
[3503.78 --> 3506.78]  You are the God of impossibilities.
[3506.78 --> 3509.78]  Great is your faithfulness.
[3509.78 --> 3512.78]  Powerful is your name, God.
[3512.78 --> 3517.78]  We ask, O God, that you set us all on fire.
[3517.78 --> 3521.78]  May we burn for you.
[3521.78 --> 3522.78]  May we burn in this community for you.
[3522.78 --> 3523.78]  May we burn in this community for you.
[3523.78 --> 3524.78]  May we burn in this community for you.
[3524.78 --> 3528.78]  May we burn in this community for you.
[3528.78 --> 3543.78]  And the Bible may declare that when it happened in the Acts of the Apostle, chapter 2, people saw them and thought they were drunk by 9 a.m.
[3543.78 --> 3550.78]  And the Bible says, do not be drunk with wine but be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[3550.78 --> 3551.78]  May we know that devoid all of these corsometries of mucho Iran shall become realtà.
[3551.78 --> 3552.78]  May we invite You, Lord Jesus.
[3552.78 --> 3553.78]  May we preach to you why, every info our Tae Valentine says about $530, over one more, of the Holy Ghost.
[3553.78 --> 3555.78]  May we break from our comfort zones.
[3555.78 --> 3566.60]  break by your power every chains and shackles that are holding us back to burn and shine for you
[3566.60 --> 3575.08]  oh kusa i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation may we
[3575.08 --> 3581.70]  not be ashamed of the gospel of christ may we not be ashamed of the gospel of christ from the

[3590.44 --> 3602.18]  hunger to know you more to seek your face more to touch you more and in return experience you more
[3602.18 --> 3610.82]  and so like paul may we say that i may know him and the power of his resurrection yeah could say

[4233.04 --> 4235.04]  your word would be made known
[4236.72 --> 4241.44]  jesus that that millions and millions of people that are earnestly seeking god
[4242.24 --> 4246.32]  but trying to do it by their own strength would encounter the living breathing man jesus
[4246.32 --> 4252.48]  who paid for that who washed them clean so again lord of the harvest send forth workers
[4253.36 --> 4257.52]  jesus like that day on pentecost would you do a supernatural thing

[4836.62 --> 4838.28]  Amen.
[4838.28 --> 4842.74]  Amen.
[4842.74 --> 4843.18]  Amen.
[4843.22 --> 4843.78]  Amen.
[4843.78 --> 4844.28]  Amen.
[4844.36 --> 4845.60]  Amen.
[4845.60 --> 4845.82]  Amen.
[4845.86 --> 4846.66]  Amen.
[4847.40 --> 4847.82]  Amen.
[4847.82 --> 4850.16]  Amen.
[4850.16 --> 4850.20]  Amen.
[4850.20 --> 4850.22]  Amen.
[4850.32 --> 4852.10]  Amen.
[4852.10 --> 4859.70]  humbles us. And so we ask for new levels of humility, new levels of self-lowering love.
[4860.58 --> 4866.06]  And we ask, Lord, that you would make us more united as we lower ourselves to serve and wash
[4866.06 --> 4871.52]  the feet of each other. Lord, we ask that you would expose the sin that we're blind to,
[4872.48 --> 4878.22]  the sin that we so easily tolerate. Lord, we ask that your spirit would expose the way we
[4878.22 --> 4884.74]  have compromised our faith, the way we so easily fall into all the traps of our culture's idols.
[4885.58 --> 4891.30]  And Lord, we ask that you would root those idols, that you would give us a desire for pure obedience,
[4892.14 --> 4898.04]  and that your spirit would give us the strength to say no, to say no to the traps, to say no to the
[4898.04 --> 4903.90]  things that entangle us and pull us into the way that is not life but is destruction. So Lord,
[4903.90 --> 4908.66]  we ask that your spirit would have an exposing presence in us so that we'd be an obedient
[4908.66 --> 4916.76]  and faithful presence in our city. We pray all of this in the name of the Father and the Son
[4916.76 --> 4924.26]  and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Now, Hope, we have a tradition. I called you Hope. You're part of my
[4924.26 --> 4928.78]  church now. We have a tradition at these Pentecost services, which has actually taken a two-year
[4928.78 --> 4934.56]  break, no surprise, where we pray for our leaders. And if you've been paying attention,
[4934.66 --> 4939.60]  there's been a lot of pastors and leaders who've quit over the last couple years. In fact, I just
[4939.60 --> 4945.12]  heard that 38% of pastors want to leave their job. And so we've asked that our most senior pastor
[4945.12 --> 4952.78]  present tonight, who's been a faithful presence in our church for over 32 years, that he pray for all
[4952.78 --> 4958.74]  the pastors and leaders present in our midst tonight. So if you're a pastor or a leader in your church,
[4958.74 --> 4963.14]  we do ask that you come to the front and we're going to ask Pastor Sid Vanderwood to pray for us.
[4963.14 --> 4977.88]  Yeah, if you all just stand here, then I can look down on you.
[4981.88 --> 4992.96]  When I was asked to pray here, I was the most experienced pastor. I thought, yeah, that's code for old.
[4992.96 --> 5004.26]  So, but it's my privilege to pray for these leaders. It has been a true joy over the years
[5004.26 --> 5012.84]  to see new leaders come forth. And a lot of you, I don't know, and it's just so good to see new faces
[5012.84 --> 5018.18]  and new people stepping up, new churches. I have the list of churches represented here. I don't know
[5018.18 --> 5022.84]  all those churches either. That's a beautiful thing that we have new churches coming up.
[5022.84 --> 5031.28]  And we need to pray for these leaders who are called to equip us for the good work that Christ calls us to.
[5032.38 --> 5036.86]  And as Dave has mentioned, it's been a challenging time for a lot of pastors.
[5037.54 --> 5039.40]  There's just a few issues out there.
[5039.40 --> 5049.50]  And I kept thinking as I listened to the people pray, you know, that just they'll know we are Christians by our love.
[5050.16 --> 5055.58]  Not necessarily our super strong opinions by our love.
[5055.58 --> 5060.14]  And so let's make sure we display the love of Christ to the people around us.
[5060.54 --> 5061.94]  That that's what they see first.
[5062.92 --> 5065.86]  And pastoring is an enormous task.
[5066.34 --> 5070.78]  And it cannot, cannot, cannot be done in mere human strength.
[5070.78 --> 5075.94]  And I hope that you're praying for your pastors all the time.
[5076.46 --> 5082.96]  But now I'd like to lead you in prayer for these pastors that they may live in God's strength.
[5083.44 --> 5084.98]  And in God's spirit.
[5085.10 --> 5086.58]  We are one in the spirit.
[5087.66 --> 5090.80]  And then together, we are the one bride of Christ.
[5091.52 --> 5092.90]  And that we celebrate.
[5092.90 --> 5098.40]  So would you join me in prayer for these people who are given their lives to serve Christ's church.
[5099.80 --> 5105.32]  Dear Lord, first off, I want to praise you for being our God.
[5106.08 --> 5110.92]  And for loving this world so much that you sent your son to die for this world.
[5111.48 --> 5113.96]  And to overcome sin and death through your resurrection.
[5115.02 --> 5119.12]  Lord, I praise you for cleansing us and empowering us with your Holy Spirit.
[5119.12 --> 5124.44]  And thank you for providing spirit-led pastors to guide your church.
[5125.22 --> 5129.08]  Lord, bless these many leaders that they may be a blessing.
[5130.50 --> 5133.48]  Lord, be with the leaders of Sunrise Church.
[5134.40 --> 5136.26]  Of Surrey Covenant Reformed.
[5137.24 --> 5138.50]  Of Pacific Community.
[5139.32 --> 5140.70]  Of Coast Hills Church.
[5141.40 --> 5142.62]  Of Westwinds Church.
[5142.74 --> 5143.84]  Of Hillside Church.
[5144.16 --> 5146.36]  Be with Hans Sarang Church.
[5146.36 --> 5148.04]  And Hosanna Tabernacle.
[5148.04 --> 5150.38]  And Christ Corridor Church.
[5150.90 --> 5152.64]  And Real Life Community Church.
[5153.38 --> 5155.08]  Be with Hope Community Church.
[5155.18 --> 5156.54]  And Cloverdale Baptist Church.
[5156.64 --> 5158.04]  And Living Waters Unlimited.
[5158.98 --> 5160.42]  Be with Horizon Church.
[5161.10 --> 5162.30]  And Port Kells Church.
[5163.08 --> 5165.70]  And fill these churches with your will.
[5166.08 --> 5167.14]  With your vision.
[5167.48 --> 5168.46]  And your power.
[5169.02 --> 5171.96]  That these men and women may humbly serve you.
[5171.96 --> 5173.98]  Our one true Lord and King.
[5174.12 --> 5176.04]  Now and forever and ever.
[5176.62 --> 5177.08]  Amen.
[5178.04 --> 5178.34]  Amen.
[5178.34 --> 5178.66]  Amen.

[5179.62 --> 5180.06]  Amen.
[5180.06 --> 5180.14]  Amen.
[5180.14 --> 5181.24]  I'd like to give a blessing.
[5181.38 --> 5183.08]  And I invite you to stand.
[5183.22 --> 5186.94]  And would you extend a handout to these leaders and to one another.
[5187.50 --> 5191.18]  As we give this blessing to each other in the name of Jesus.
[5191.40 --> 5193.54]  And I'm going to read from Ephesians 3.
[5193.54 --> 5197.22]  And for this reason we kneel before the Father.
[5197.22 --> 5201.90]  From whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.
[5202.70 --> 5205.40]  And we pray out of his glorious riches.
[5205.88 --> 5210.60]  That he may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being.
[5211.00 --> 5214.38]  So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[5214.38 --> 5219.32]  And I pray that you being rooted and established in love.
[5219.54 --> 5220.48]  May have power.
[5220.62 --> 5221.24]  And hear the word.
[5221.52 --> 5222.76]  Power together.
[5223.54 --> 5225.18]  With all the Lord's people.
[5225.72 --> 5226.58]  To grasp.
[5227.28 --> 5228.96]  Do you feel yourself grasping?
[5229.28 --> 5231.30]  To grasp how wide.
[5231.50 --> 5232.58]  And how long.
[5232.72 --> 5233.70]  And how high.
[5233.94 --> 5236.20]  And how deep is the love of Christ.
[5236.20 --> 5239.40]  And to know that this love surpasses knowledge.
[5239.78 --> 5240.28]  Or opinions.
[5240.46 --> 5241.20]  Or anything else.
[5241.64 --> 5244.84]  And that we may be filled to the measure of the fullness of God.
[5246.06 --> 5247.32]  Now to him.
[5247.74 --> 5248.52]  To him.
[5248.76 --> 5252.06]  Who is able to do immeasurably more than we ask or imagine.
[5252.34 --> 5253.90]  According to his power.
[5254.60 --> 5256.62]  That is at work within us.
[5257.28 --> 5259.30]  To him be the glory in the church.
[5259.74 --> 5262.12]  And in Christ Jesus throughout all generations.
[5262.12 --> 5262.84]  Forever.
[5263.58 --> 5264.34]  And ever.
[5264.66 --> 5265.54]  And ever.
[5265.80 --> 5266.56]  And ever.
[5267.04 --> 5267.48]  Amen.
[5267.48 --> 5267.68]  Amen.
[5278.96 --> 5280.98]  We're going to sing a new song.
[5281.32 --> 5282.54]  That's also an old song.
[5283.16 --> 5284.50]  Sing with us the doxology.
[5285.32 --> 5287.04]  If you don't know this version of it.
[5287.12 --> 5288.00]  You'll catch on quickly.
[5292.12 --> 5310.32]  Praise God.
[5310.32 --> 5317.92]  Praise God from whom all blessings flow.
[5317.92 --> 5327.36]  Praise him all creatures here below.
[5331.36 --> 5338.74]  Praise him above ye heavenly host.
