[0.00 --> 7.34]  Well, good morning, Hope. It is good to gather together again.
[7.94 --> 10.36]  I see a number of new faces, and so I'll just introduce myself.
[10.44 --> 11.94]  My name is Dave. I'm one of the pastors here.
[12.48 --> 14.40]  It's a gift to start a new ministry season together.
[15.20 --> 18.98]  As part of our new ministry season, we're going to start a new sermon series on the book of James.
[19.72 --> 23.92]  And I realized this week that I had never preached a sermon on James before.
[24.08 --> 24.96]  And we're going to make that right.
[25.04 --> 26.40]  We're going to preach on James for a while.
[26.40 --> 31.14]  Well, and you'll see also by the art that we want to hold out what James is all about.
[31.22 --> 37.32]  You're going to learn in this series that James is a book that is filled with practical, concrete wisdom
[37.32 --> 40.10]  on how to live the Christian faith.
[40.88 --> 46.24]  James is a kind of book that wants to see what we believe and what we say we believe visible in our actions.
[46.36 --> 50.58]  It's a book that's very much on the ground, and that's what we're trying to communicate with the banners and the decor.
[50.84 --> 53.28]  Thank you both, Desiree and John and the Hope Art Collective.
[53.28 --> 58.10]  And take some time sort of taking in what you think they're communicating about this book throughout the series.
[59.90 --> 64.06]  We want to say at the outset that what we want you to do this week, but also throughout the whole series,
[64.30 --> 66.00]  is read the book of James.
[66.38 --> 67.76]  This is a powerful book.
[68.08 --> 69.54]  It's also a challenging book.
[69.60 --> 71.20]  I know for some of us it's a favorite book.
[71.58 --> 75.32]  But it's only five chapters, and I would love for us this week to go through that whole book.
[75.40 --> 77.74]  You could read chapter a day, and you're done by Thursday or Friday.
[77.74 --> 81.38]  And that's just going to help you orient and understand where we're going to be going.
[82.38 --> 87.56]  And so, if you have your Bible, digital or physical, turn with me to James chapter 2.
[87.64 --> 93.60]  I'm going to overview the book today, but I've picked a passage that I think is sort of a sum of the whole,
[93.70 --> 95.98]  and that's in James 2, verse 14 and following.
[95.98 --> 107.88]  What good is it, brothers and sisters, if people claim to have faith but have no deeds?
[108.64 --> 110.26]  Can such a faith save them?
[111.22 --> 114.32]  Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.
[114.90 --> 119.80]  If one of you says to them, go in peace, keep warm and well fed, but does nothing about their physical needs,
[120.10 --> 121.18]  what good is it?
[121.18 --> 127.04]  In the same way, faith by itself, if not accompanied by action, is dead.
[128.10 --> 131.36]  But someone will say, you have faith, I have deeds.
[132.10 --> 137.66]  Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.
[143.34 --> 148.42]  I think it's fair to say that one of the most common and consistent criticisms of the church,
[148.42 --> 151.70]  as long as I've been part of the church, is this.
[151.74 --> 152.68]  See if you can fill in the blank.
[153.16 --> 158.22]  The church is just a bunch of hypocrites.
[159.16 --> 160.56]  Sounds like you've heard that one too.
[160.66 --> 162.30]  Perhaps you've said that one before.
[162.76 --> 165.52]  This church is so compromised, it's full of hypocrites.
[165.60 --> 169.78]  And maybe it'd be helpful, just at the outset, for me to give us a working definition of hypocrisy.
[169.78 --> 171.82]  This is just pulled off the internet.
[171.82 --> 181.20]  We read, hypocrisy is the practice of professing beliefs, feelings, or virtues that one does not hold or possess.
[181.48 --> 182.50]  It's a falseness.
[182.68 --> 183.90]  It's a pretending.
[185.18 --> 186.88]  And here's how it looks when people look at the church.
[186.98 --> 192.74]  They say, hey, I know that this person, they go to church, and they talk, and they pray, and they sing about loving their neighbor,
[192.74 --> 196.14]  but I know what they're like at work, and they have a wicked temper.
[196.86 --> 197.02]  Right?
[197.02 --> 203.66]  Or I know that they go to church, and I know at church they talk about being generous and tithing and caring for the needs of the city,
[203.66 --> 209.18]  but I know for certain that that guy is so greedy, he cuts corners with his finances,
[209.38 --> 212.64]  and he doesn't give a rip about the vulnerable people in our city.
[213.98 --> 220.56]  Or these people, they know that the Christians that worship at Jesus who invites them to forgiveness and reconciliation,
[220.56 --> 228.22]  and they know for certain that that woman, when she gets home, she is grudgeful, revengeful, and she is downright mean.
[229.42 --> 233.38]  And so people look at the church, they look at the friends they have who are Christians, and they say to themselves,
[233.50 --> 236.32]  good riddance, what a bunch of hypocrites.
[238.02 --> 241.18]  Now, when you hear these criticisms, I'm sure some of you have heard them and even shared them,
[241.52 --> 245.58]  there is probably inside you this little flinch, just a little flinch to defend Christians, right?
[246.20 --> 248.52]  It's like, hey, we're all hypocrites, one to another.
[248.52 --> 252.28]  We're all hypocrites, right? And I just want to say at the outset that that's a legitimate criticism.
[253.32 --> 255.90]  The church is full of hypocrites. Let me put a finer point on it.
[256.44 --> 262.50]  There's a very good chance that someone has looked at your life and come to that conclusion about the church.
[263.26 --> 267.50]  There's a good chance that someone saw your driving and thought that about the church.
[268.14 --> 271.68]  Or they looked at the way you interact with friends, the way you navigate your workplace complexity,
[271.76 --> 275.54]  the way you talk to your kids and thought, good riddance, what a hypocrite.
[275.54 --> 278.00]  I'm sure that's been said of me.
[279.06 --> 284.96]  And I think it's fair to say that in all of our lives, there exists a pretty significant chasm
[284.96 --> 289.64]  between what we say we believe about Jesus, the world, the Christian life,
[289.74 --> 295.28]  and how we act on Monday morning, on Wednesday night, and Friday with our friends.
[296.10 --> 298.78]  There's a gap. We have to name that gap.
[298.78 --> 303.36]  In fact, there's a church a few years ago doing a bit of a series on hypocrisy,
[303.60 --> 307.44]  and they printed a whole bunch of t-shirts to help the church sort of walk through it and sort of have conversations.
[307.82 --> 310.28]  And the t-shirts read, Recovering Hypocrite.
[311.06 --> 313.46]  And that caused a lot of good conversation.
[314.40 --> 315.24]  Recovering Hypocrite.
[316.24 --> 317.96]  Now, hypocrisy is nothing new in the church.
[318.48 --> 319.88]  This is an old challenge.
[319.96 --> 323.62]  In fact, the book of James is addressing hypocrisy.
[323.62 --> 330.74]  I think that's one of the main concerns that James expresses in this book as he challenges the church to live what they believe.
[331.38 --> 334.96]  He's saying, if this is what you profess and this is who you believe Jesus to be,
[335.10 --> 339.10]  it needs to look like something tangibly in your lives.
[339.46 --> 341.94]  You can't have this incredible incongruity.
[342.58 --> 349.56]  And James, I would say, is chasing after that consistent life, the life that's integrity,
[349.56 --> 356.00]  where you say this and you believe it, where what you express as your belief about Jesus is visible in the way you speak to your spouse,
[356.16 --> 359.04]  the way you live at work, the way you talk to your friends, the way you do your education.
[359.34 --> 360.62]  There's a harmony there.
[361.72 --> 367.28]  In fact, a word that shows up seven times, not coincidentally, in the book of James is perfection.
[368.06 --> 371.94]  James is urging the church to live perfect lives, to mirror their perfect God,
[371.94 --> 378.52]  because perfection in James, important detail, is a life that is whole, a life that is consistent,
[379.12 --> 382.08]  a life where you know what a person believes because of how they live.
[382.14 --> 382.94]  There's no disconnect.
[383.08 --> 384.02]  There's no incongruity.
[384.12 --> 387.60]  There's no fracturedness between what someone believes and how they live.
[388.00 --> 389.00]  That's what he's after.
[390.06 --> 392.22]  And I think, I hope you'll agree with me,
[392.68 --> 397.60]  that the book of James is profoundly challenging and profoundly relevant to our day
[397.60 --> 405.08]  because it speaks into the gap, the gap that we're very aware of between what we say we believe and how we act.
[405.32 --> 409.16]  James wants us to ask the uncomfortable questions, what's with the distance?
[409.84 --> 411.30]  And is this a living faith?
[411.30 --> 418.06]  If there's no real evidence in your actual life, your ordinary day-to-day habits that you follow and believe in Jesus,
[418.38 --> 421.58]  let's talk about what kind of faith you have.
[422.72 --> 427.28]  He has no problem, you should know, calling the church back over and over again to obedience,
[427.60 --> 431.32]  and fidelity, and loyalty to Jesus.
[431.32 --> 436.64]  That leads to consistency and resists the hypocrisy.
[438.12 --> 441.76]  Now, you should know that the book of James has been so challenging that in different generations,
[442.00 --> 444.40]  people have said, should this book be in the Bible?
[444.94 --> 445.40]  You know that?
[445.74 --> 449.78]  In fact, if you know Reformed history, you'll know that one of the people who had questions and frustrations with it
[449.78 --> 454.66]  is Martin Luther, sort of the big reformer who sort of brought people back to the Bible.
[455.04 --> 457.04]  But Martin Luther's like, what's with this book?
[457.60 --> 458.98]  This isn't like the other letters.
[459.08 --> 461.56]  The other letters are a lot more grace.
[462.42 --> 464.08]  And this book is a lot more challenge.
[464.76 --> 469.94]  And people have consistently said, wow, this is not as gentle as other books in the Bible.
[470.56 --> 474.54]  James goes right for it, calling the church to action, calling the church to wake up.
[474.54 --> 477.08]  He's not preoccupied with comforting believers.
[477.42 --> 479.32]  He wants them to see reality.
[479.32 --> 487.00]  And he wants them to know, and this is so important for us today, believing in Jesus is not just a bunch of ideas.
[487.96 --> 489.60]  Believing in Jesus is action.
[490.28 --> 491.96]  It's the pattern of life.
[491.96 --> 500.20]  And how often people, when they look at the church, perhaps even we in the church, we think of Christianity as a set of doctrines that we believe in our heads.
[500.24 --> 501.84]  And if you get those doctrines right, you're good.
[502.06 --> 504.22]  Whereas James says, show me.
[505.68 --> 507.52]  Show me the Christian faith.
[508.18 --> 509.96]  Show me what it looks like.
[509.96 --> 518.92]  In fact, I would say a guiding question that sort of drives James is, if it is true that you follow Jesus, if it's true that his death and resurrection has changed your life, what does it look like?
[519.52 --> 520.80]  What does it look like with your friends?
[521.48 --> 522.78]  What does it look like with your money?
[523.18 --> 524.54]  What does it look like with your speech?
[524.84 --> 526.76]  What does it look like with your relationship with the poor?
[526.82 --> 530.02]  Those are things he gets at a number of times throughout this book.
[530.42 --> 532.60]  Show me your faith.
[536.04 --> 538.58]  A bit of helpful context about the book of James.
[538.58 --> 540.44]  It's written by James.
[541.12 --> 543.34]  But you might not know that James is the brother of Jesus.
[544.06 --> 545.00]  He grew up with Jesus.
[545.52 --> 551.26]  And James, after Jesus' death, resurrection, and ascension, he became a very prominent leader in the Jerusalem church.
[551.38 --> 559.78]  That's sort of the mother church of all the churches that would later be planted in the region of the ancient Near East, or sorry, Asia Minor.
[560.38 --> 563.64]  And so James was known as a wise, godly, faithful leader.
[563.64 --> 568.84]  And what's really interesting is he was a wise, godly, faithful leader in very turbulent times.
[569.46 --> 571.20]  James lived through political turmoil.
[571.48 --> 573.04]  He lived through famines in the land.
[573.12 --> 578.60]  And he lived through persecution from the Jews, whose faith he left so that they could plant a church and be part of the Jesus-following movement.
[579.22 --> 580.60]  And so James lived a tough life.
[580.70 --> 584.70]  And in all of it, I love this detail, James was known as a peacemaker.
[585.84 --> 586.52]  Don't you love that?
[586.52 --> 591.44]  In the middle of a very difficult life and ministry, this guy was a peacemaker.
[592.70 --> 595.46]  In 62 AD, James was martyred for his faith.
[595.84 --> 606.34]  And I think we should just pause and recognize that the book we have before us, these words were written by someone who not only talked about having incongruent life and caring and living out what you believe, he actually died for what he believed.
[606.96 --> 609.42]  He lived with integrity, and he died with integrity.
[609.42 --> 613.28]  And these words are a gift from the Lord through James to the church.
[613.28 --> 619.54]  Now, one of the things I love and I'm learning about the book of James is how different it is from other books of the Bible.
[620.12 --> 624.60]  It's read, of course, often understood as a letter, but this is not like other letters.
[624.86 --> 630.04]  You know, when Paul writes his letters like Ephesians, Philippians, Galatians, there's sort of a very significant body to it.
[630.08 --> 632.38]  He speaks to a specific community about particular issues.
[632.66 --> 633.74]  There's a movement to the letter.
[633.86 --> 635.18]  James is not like that.
[635.86 --> 637.50]  James has a very different feel to it.
[637.50 --> 640.88]  Even when you read it this week, you're like, okay, this has a, it just feels a little more disjointed.
[640.88 --> 644.06]  And that is because James is wisdom literature.
[645.48 --> 647.76]  James reads more like the Proverbs.
[648.54 --> 652.12]  In fact, most people say that you'll see, you can almost hear the Proverbs as he's speaking.
[652.22 --> 653.32]  He's giving rich imagery.
[653.48 --> 664.36]  He's giving strong statements and contrasts, very poignant, punchy things that sort of perk your imagination and prick you to think of like, okay, what does it mean to live as a follower of Jesus?
[664.86 --> 666.60]  How does this interact with my own story?
[666.60 --> 672.36]  It's a book that's meant to be read slowly and sort of digesting in your own life the wisdom that he's giving us.
[672.64 --> 673.42]  It's a wisdom book.
[675.02 --> 678.34]  You know, a good illustration on how to read this book comes from my sister-in-law, Erin.
[678.46 --> 679.80]  She's a professor at UBC.
[680.58 --> 681.74]  She teaches on English literature.
[681.90 --> 684.84]  And she often, in the past anyway, has given students two pieces of chocolate.
[685.52 --> 687.18]  Really good way to make friends with your students, by the way.
[687.62 --> 690.08]  And she said to her students, okay, just eat the first piece of chocolate.
[690.20 --> 692.82]  Of course, most students, they open the wrapper, they just wolf it down, they're done.
[692.82 --> 697.24]  And she says, okay, before you eat your second one, I want you to take your time.
[698.08 --> 698.70]  Eat it slowly.
[698.92 --> 699.82]  Pay attention to the texture.
[700.02 --> 701.00]  Pay attention to the flavors.
[701.42 --> 702.36]  And, of course, they eat it.
[702.40 --> 703.04]  And then she'll ask questions.
[703.10 --> 703.82]  Okay, what did you notice?
[703.88 --> 708.80]  And all of a sudden, they notice so much about the piece of chocolate the second time that they did not notice the first time.
[709.56 --> 713.46]  And I think the book of James is to be read like that second piece of chocolate is to be eaten.
[714.08 --> 715.20]  You digest it slowly.
[715.32 --> 716.32]  You pay close attention.
[716.46 --> 720.26]  You let it sort of percolate in your imagination and allow it to read your life.
[720.58 --> 721.88]  That's how you read wisdom literature.
[723.30 --> 725.20]  But James is not just wisdom literature.
[725.42 --> 728.26]  In fact, James is deeply affected by Jesus.
[729.20 --> 730.80]  James is his brother, so it's not surprising.
[730.80 --> 737.80]  And, you know, if I had more time, I'd show you how so much of what James writes about mirrors what Jesus teaches on in the Sermon on the Mount.
[738.20 --> 741.16]  There's allusions and quotations to Jesus' own teaching in the Sermon on the Mount.
[741.24 --> 743.28]  You'll find, even as you read it, there's connections there.
[743.28 --> 751.00]  And in Sermon, then, what he's doing is he's taking the richness of Old Testament wisdom that's meant to instruct people how to live well.
[751.42 --> 757.28]  And then he's taking the teaching of Jesus that he cares so deeply about, and he's bringing both of those to bear on this community,
[757.66 --> 760.94]  these scattered Christians, these Jewish believers who are having a hard time and saying,
[760.94 --> 765.06]  this is how we must live our faith.
[765.76 --> 773.72]  This is what it looks like when faith is practiced, when beliefs are visible, when we move from hypocrisy to integrity.
[773.72 --> 778.62]  That's all my introduction to our passage and to the book.
[779.04 --> 782.06]  Which brings us, then, to the chapter 2, which we read.
[782.14 --> 783.48]  And I'm actually just going to read it again.
[784.54 --> 785.28]  James 2.
[786.54 --> 791.76]  What good is it, brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?
[792.30 --> 793.74]  Can such a faith save them?
[794.54 --> 797.60]  Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.
[798.08 --> 802.98]  If one of you say to them, go in peace, keep warm and well-fed, but does nothing about their physical needs,
[802.98 --> 804.50]  what good is it?
[805.30 --> 810.86]  In the same way, faith by itself, if not accompanied by action, is dead.
[811.80 --> 813.98]  But some will say, you have faith, I have deeds.
[814.56 --> 821.40]  Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
[822.70 --> 826.46]  And you can get a sense of how James writes in his whole book just from that passage.
[826.64 --> 829.42]  You get his directness, you get his sort of poignant statements,
[829.72 --> 831.46]  a punchy way of getting you to think about faith.
[831.46 --> 832.56]  Is it living or is it dead?
[832.62 --> 833.60]  Is your faith caring for the poor?
[833.66 --> 835.00]  If not, is it alive?
[835.22 --> 837.94]  And he's okay, asking the hard questions.
[838.84 --> 841.28]  What kind of faith is it that we have?
[842.68 --> 845.58]  And, you know, if you've grown up in the church, even if you're a new Christian,
[846.06 --> 849.30]  maybe you've heard the different categories that Christians have for Christians.
[850.10 --> 852.80]  You know, I've heard people in this church who've come out of a Catholic background
[852.80 --> 854.86]  talk about sort of being a nominal Catholic.
[854.86 --> 858.52]  Or I've heard people talk about non-practicing Christians.
[858.60 --> 860.56]  Have you heard that category, a non-practicing Christian?
[861.54 --> 863.46]  Or in our denomination, we have this category.
[863.54 --> 864.40]  I'm getting close to home now.
[864.76 --> 866.74]  It's called a non-active member.
[866.74 --> 871.02]  And I'm increasingly convinced that if you were to tell James,
[871.06 --> 875.82]  we've got these categories like non-practicing Christian, non-active member,
[875.90 --> 877.48]  he would say, pardon me?
[878.58 --> 880.22]  Non-practicing Christian?
[880.36 --> 880.86]  Come again?
[881.24 --> 882.40]  What is that?
[883.00 --> 884.40]  And he would have some hard questions.
[884.48 --> 886.64]  So like, when you say non-practicing Christian,
[886.86 --> 890.16]  what you probably are trying to say is dead faith.
[891.16 --> 892.10]  I'm not saying this.
[892.70 --> 893.58]  James is saying that.
[894.36 --> 897.88]  And James assumes, and this is really significant teaching in the book of James,
[898.42 --> 902.06]  and James assumes, and this is really significant teaching in the book of James,
[902.42 --> 904.38]  that if there is faith, it's going to be visible.
[905.10 --> 908.00]  If your life is planted in Jesus Christ like a tree,
[908.08 --> 912.32]  an image Jesus himself uses, there has to be fruit, right?
[912.82 --> 913.84]  Not immediately.
[914.04 --> 917.16]  He knows that the coming to Christ is a messy process for many people,
[917.24 --> 919.88]  dying to yourself, learning new patterns, putting to death,
[919.88 --> 920.60]  these old patterns.
[920.86 --> 925.34]  But if there's no evidence that you follow Jesus in your words,
[925.66 --> 927.20]  your money, your relationships,
[928.12 --> 930.98]  he's ready to ask us some hard, probing questions.
[933.18 --> 935.22]  James wants to know, what kind of faith is it?
[935.24 --> 938.08]  Is it living faith that's practiced, or is it dead faith?
[938.24 --> 939.52]  Let's have a hard conversation.
[940.98 --> 944.30]  And that brings us to what I think is a really important question
[944.30 --> 947.46]  that people through generations have asked about the book of James,
[947.82 --> 948.64]  including Martin Luther.
[948.64 --> 950.44]  People read the book, maybe you'll have that this week,
[950.54 --> 951.44]  and you might say to yourself,
[951.88 --> 953.90]  whoa, whoa, whoa, James.
[954.72 --> 957.88]  I've read other parts of the Bible talk about works,
[957.94 --> 959.16]  because you're talking a lot about deeds,
[959.26 --> 960.22]  you're talking a lot about works,
[960.26 --> 961.26]  and when I read you, James,
[961.30 --> 963.46]  it sounds a bit like works-based righteousness.
[964.12 --> 966.06]  Because when I read Paul in other letters,
[966.10 --> 966.88]  I hear him say,
[967.28 --> 972.02]  you are saved by grace through faith,
[972.02 --> 975.62]  and this is not by works.
[976.36 --> 977.58]  And now we're reading James thinking,
[977.68 --> 981.16]  it sounds a little bit like we earn salvation through works.
[981.74 --> 983.10]  And so I want to pause on this dynamic,
[983.10 --> 984.68]  because it's an important dynamic,
[984.92 --> 986.84]  and I'll say what I know James agrees with,
[986.90 --> 987.96]  and Paul agrees with,
[988.48 --> 991.18]  that you did nothing to earn your salvation.
[991.98 --> 993.66]  That is, as Paul himself says,
[993.72 --> 995.52]  a gift from God.
[996.12 --> 997.10]  He saved you,
[997.20 --> 997.98]  he opened your eyes,
[998.04 --> 999.14]  he regenerated your heart
[999.14 --> 1000.52]  through the work of Jesus Christ
[1000.52 --> 1001.44]  and his death and resurrection.
[1001.88 --> 1003.00]  You do not,
[1003.08 --> 1003.96]  and I do not,
[1004.08 --> 1004.82]  deserve that.
[1005.04 --> 1006.06]  James and Paul both agree.
[1006.90 --> 1007.28]  In fact,
[1007.74 --> 1008.74]  a story that comes to mind
[1008.74 --> 1009.64]  as I look at this passage
[1009.64 --> 1010.98]  is from my own examination.
[1011.66 --> 1013.18]  To become a pastor in the CRC,
[1013.30 --> 1014.02]  you have to be examined,
[1014.22 --> 1014.96]  and all the other pastors
[1014.96 --> 1016.04]  get to kick the tires on you
[1016.04 --> 1016.96]  and make sure you're not a heretic.
[1017.54 --> 1017.76]  In fact,
[1017.78 --> 1018.82]  there's a couple of you who are there
[1018.82 --> 1019.82]  asking those questions.
[1020.80 --> 1021.78]  And one of the pastors
[1021.78 --> 1022.46]  asked me a question
[1022.46 --> 1023.18]  about this dynamic
[1023.18 --> 1024.90]  of the Reformed faith and grace,
[1024.90 --> 1025.64]  and I remember,
[1025.78 --> 1025.96]  like,
[1026.04 --> 1027.08]  a good Reformed pastor,
[1027.22 --> 1028.32]  I quoted Ephesians 2.
[1028.66 --> 1030.56]  And Ephesians 2 is where Paul says,
[1031.08 --> 1032.18]  for it is by grace
[1032.18 --> 1033.08]  you have been saved
[1033.08 --> 1034.00]  through faith.
[1034.16 --> 1035.44]  And this is not of yourselves.
[1035.62 --> 1036.82]  It's a gift from God,
[1037.04 --> 1038.10]  not by works,
[1038.20 --> 1040.34]  so that no one can boast.
[1041.34 --> 1041.82]  There you go.
[1041.96 --> 1042.62]  Knockout argument
[1042.62 --> 1043.76]  on grace through faith.
[1043.88 --> 1045.10]  No works to earn your salvation.
[1045.64 --> 1046.40]  Guess what happened
[1046.40 --> 1047.36]  after I quoted this?
[1048.20 --> 1048.84]  An old,
[1049.02 --> 1049.40]  wise,
[1049.58 --> 1050.32]  seasoned pastor
[1050.32 --> 1051.44]  stood up and he said,
[1051.84 --> 1052.98]  what does the rest
[1052.98 --> 1053.98]  of that passage say?
[1055.38 --> 1055.96]  Does anyone know?
[1057.04 --> 1057.64]  You know what Paul says
[1057.64 --> 1058.18]  right after this,
[1058.22 --> 1059.22]  the very next verse?
[1059.96 --> 1060.26]  He says,
[1060.42 --> 1062.54]  for we are God's handiwork,
[1062.84 --> 1064.06]  created in Christ Jesus
[1064.06 --> 1067.08]  to do good work,
[1067.78 --> 1068.68]  which Christ prepared
[1068.68 --> 1069.96]  in advance for us to do.
[1072.16 --> 1073.14]  So there's harmony
[1073.14 --> 1074.80]  between Paul and James.
[1074.90 --> 1075.56]  Now I'm going to come back
[1075.56 --> 1076.10]  to some of the ways
[1076.10 --> 1076.96]  that they actually correct
[1076.96 --> 1077.26]  one another.
[1077.32 --> 1077.84]  I think there's actually
[1077.84 --> 1079.08]  a mutual blessing
[1079.08 --> 1080.16]  in their emphases
[1080.16 --> 1081.92]  and the way they contextualize
[1081.92 --> 1082.66]  the faith and works
[1082.66 --> 1083.32]  to different audiences.
[1083.32 --> 1083.94]  We'll come back.
[1084.22 --> 1085.14]  But Paul and James
[1085.14 --> 1086.00]  agree on this.
[1086.30 --> 1087.60]  You are saved by grace
[1087.60 --> 1088.22]  through faith.
[1088.42 --> 1089.18]  But here's the thing.
[1090.24 --> 1091.90]  Faith never comes by itself.
[1093.14 --> 1094.14]  Faith never exists
[1094.14 --> 1094.88]  in a vacuum.
[1095.46 --> 1096.42]  And what James wants you to know
[1096.42 --> 1097.76]  is faith is not
[1097.76 --> 1099.30]  just intellectually
[1099.30 --> 1100.82]  assenting to ideas.
[1101.82 --> 1103.70]  Faith must be visible
[1103.70 --> 1105.94]  and transform our deeds.
[1106.68 --> 1107.82]  Going back to the plant
[1107.82 --> 1108.30]  and the tree,
[1108.68 --> 1109.30]  if we are rooted
[1109.30 --> 1110.10]  in the life of Christ,
[1110.10 --> 1112.20]  there must be evidence.
[1116.22 --> 1116.62]  You know,
[1116.68 --> 1117.36]  this is an example.
[1117.48 --> 1117.70]  I don't know
[1117.70 --> 1118.88]  if this is a perfect example,
[1119.02 --> 1120.12]  but it reminds me
[1120.12 --> 1120.88]  of that sort of
[1120.88 --> 1122.00]  popular corporate
[1122.00 --> 1123.32]  team building exercise
[1123.32 --> 1124.22]  that was like
[1124.22 --> 1125.50]  interesting years ago.
[1125.66 --> 1125.84]  You know,
[1125.88 --> 1126.24]  in corporate,
[1126.36 --> 1127.08]  if you're part of the corporate world,
[1127.14 --> 1127.64]  maybe you know this,
[1127.72 --> 1129.22]  where you tell a co-worker,
[1129.36 --> 1129.50]  okay,
[1129.64 --> 1130.38]  do you believe
[1130.38 --> 1131.36]  that if you fall backwards,
[1131.44 --> 1132.10]  I will catch you?
[1132.74 --> 1133.28]  And they say,
[1133.34 --> 1133.58]  yes,
[1133.58 --> 1134.98]  I believe that if I fall backwards,
[1135.18 --> 1135.92]  you will catch me.
[1135.98 --> 1136.38]  And then you say,
[1136.46 --> 1136.68]  okay,
[1137.18 --> 1137.90]  fall backwards.
[1138.74 --> 1139.06]  Of course,
[1139.06 --> 1139.64]  they fall backwards,
[1139.72 --> 1140.28]  you don't catch them,
[1140.34 --> 1140.86]  they're traumatized
[1140.86 --> 1141.48]  for the rest of their life.
[1142.02 --> 1142.74]  That actually happened.
[1142.82 --> 1143.38]  I once did that
[1143.38 --> 1143.90]  with Adele,
[1144.00 --> 1144.48]  my daughter,
[1144.66 --> 1145.38]  and outside,
[1145.66 --> 1146.38]  and then she thought
[1146.38 --> 1147.26]  she could just fall backwards
[1147.26 --> 1147.78]  any time
[1147.78 --> 1148.34]  and I'd catch her.
[1148.42 --> 1149.02]  And she fell back
[1149.02 --> 1149.54]  and hit the curb.
[1149.86 --> 1151.48]  So this is a traumatic story
[1151.48 --> 1152.08]  for our family.
[1153.60 --> 1154.60]  But you get the point.
[1154.74 --> 1154.90]  Like,
[1155.00 --> 1155.66]  if you believe
[1155.66 --> 1156.12]  that the person
[1156.12 --> 1156.56]  will catch you
[1156.56 --> 1157.24]  when you fall backwards,
[1157.34 --> 1158.42]  then you can do it
[1158.42 --> 1159.52]  and you're validating
[1159.52 --> 1159.90]  your belief
[1159.90 --> 1160.84]  by falling backwards.
[1161.02 --> 1162.22]  And if you don't fall backwards
[1162.22 --> 1163.18]  after saying you believe
[1163.18 --> 1163.94]  the person will catch you,
[1164.22 --> 1165.60]  the person can rightly say,
[1165.72 --> 1166.66]  are you sure you believe
[1166.66 --> 1167.28]  that it'll catch you
[1167.28 --> 1168.10]  if you fall backwards?
[1168.10 --> 1169.68]  So it is with James,
[1169.80 --> 1170.56]  faith, and work.
[1170.94 --> 1171.68]  If it is true
[1171.68 --> 1172.18]  that you believe
[1172.18 --> 1173.08]  that Jesus calls us
[1173.08 --> 1173.50]  to this life,
[1173.58 --> 1174.34]  if it is true
[1174.34 --> 1175.24]  that you're following Him,
[1175.48 --> 1177.52]  it must be made manifest
[1177.52 --> 1179.14]  in what you do.
[1180.50 --> 1182.04]  Moving from hypocrisy
[1182.04 --> 1183.68]  to integrity.
[1184.68 --> 1185.60]  From a distance
[1185.60 --> 1186.32]  between what you say
[1186.32 --> 1186.70]  you believe
[1186.70 --> 1187.36]  and what you do
[1187.36 --> 1188.84]  to a consistency saying,
[1189.00 --> 1189.36]  I believe
[1189.36 --> 1190.78]  and you can see it
[1190.78 --> 1192.12]  in how I act.
[1192.66 --> 1193.82]  You can see it
[1193.82 --> 1194.88]  in how I treat my neighbors.
[1195.02 --> 1195.68]  You can see it
[1195.68 --> 1196.40]  with my relationship
[1196.40 --> 1197.12]  with my money.
[1198.10 --> 1201.18]  So a few concluding remarks
[1201.18 --> 1203.06]  as we sort of focus
[1203.06 --> 1203.92]  on the introducing
[1203.92 --> 1205.24]  of this book this morning.
[1205.54 --> 1206.06]  Number one,
[1206.52 --> 1207.30]  I hope you can already
[1207.30 --> 1208.04]  begin to see with me
[1208.04 --> 1208.78]  how challenging
[1208.78 --> 1209.84]  the book of James is.
[1210.42 --> 1211.46]  And as a friend of mine put it,
[1211.50 --> 1212.88]  the church has a reputation problem.
[1213.56 --> 1214.50]  And the reputation problem
[1214.50 --> 1214.92]  is because we have
[1214.92 --> 1215.98]  a hypocrisy problem.
[1216.48 --> 1217.32]  There's a sense in which
[1217.32 --> 1218.66]  we know there's a gap.
[1219.02 --> 1219.64]  But here's the thing
[1219.64 --> 1220.60]  I think we need to recognize
[1220.60 --> 1221.08]  this morning.
[1221.38 --> 1222.76]  Not only are we aware,
[1222.86 --> 1223.14]  I think,
[1223.14 --> 1223.68]  that there's a gap
[1223.68 --> 1224.22]  between our words
[1224.22 --> 1224.66]  and our deeds,
[1224.66 --> 1225.48]  but I think the challenge
[1225.48 --> 1226.04]  we have is
[1226.04 --> 1227.58]  we just don't care much
[1227.58 --> 1228.66]  about the division
[1228.66 --> 1229.96]  between what we say is true,
[1230.02 --> 1230.86]  what we believe about Jesus,
[1230.96 --> 1231.48]  and how we're living.
[1232.04 --> 1233.32]  And I think James probes in
[1233.32 --> 1233.66]  and says,
[1233.86 --> 1234.94]  let's talk about that gap.
[1235.70 --> 1236.66]  Let's talk about what it means
[1236.66 --> 1237.60]  to pursue perfection.
[1238.30 --> 1239.64]  Let's talk about Christ's invitation
[1239.64 --> 1240.44]  for you to mirror
[1240.44 --> 1241.50]  his godliness,
[1241.78 --> 1242.50]  his love,
[1242.60 --> 1243.12]  his mercy,
[1243.22 --> 1243.80]  his justice,
[1244.08 --> 1244.88]  and his patience.
[1246.48 --> 1247.14]  There's a writer
[1247.14 --> 1248.26]  by the name of Kierkegaard.
[1249.14 --> 1249.98]  Lived in Denmark
[1249.98 --> 1251.34]  in what's called Christendom.
[1251.48 --> 1252.30]  And Christendom is basically
[1252.30 --> 1252.94]  when Christianity
[1252.94 --> 1253.78]  was a state religion.
[1253.88 --> 1254.58]  It was just assumed
[1254.58 --> 1255.38]  everyone was a Christian.
[1255.76 --> 1256.60]  And Kierkegaard noticed
[1256.60 --> 1257.42]  that everyone believed
[1257.42 --> 1258.42]  that you're saved by grace
[1258.42 --> 1259.14]  through faith
[1259.14 --> 1259.84]  apart from works.
[1259.90 --> 1260.98]  And what he noticed, though,
[1261.28 --> 1261.90]  is that it was like
[1261.90 --> 1263.00]  this buzz phrase.
[1263.14 --> 1263.52]  And everyone's like,
[1263.54 --> 1264.08]  oh yeah, of course,
[1264.14 --> 1264.86]  it's good, we're saved.
[1264.92 --> 1266.18]  And it led to what he described
[1266.18 --> 1266.98]  as a dangerous
[1266.98 --> 1268.86]  and lazy faith.
[1269.82 --> 1271.00]  And let me ask the question,
[1271.58 --> 1272.32]  would you not say
[1272.32 --> 1273.26]  that's also true
[1273.26 --> 1275.06]  in much of the Western church?
[1276.04 --> 1276.76]  I prayed.
[1277.38 --> 1277.98]  I was baptized.
[1278.62 --> 1279.24]  I'm forgiven.
[1279.84 --> 1280.32]  I'm good.
[1280.80 --> 1281.38]  We don't need to talk
[1281.38 --> 1281.96]  about the details
[1281.96 --> 1282.72]  that aren't figured out.
[1282.92 --> 1283.72]  I know I'm a mess.
[1283.80 --> 1284.48]  I know there's sin.
[1284.66 --> 1285.38]  We'll figure that out.
[1285.44 --> 1285.94]  There's a sense
[1285.94 --> 1287.46]  in which you're unconcerned
[1287.46 --> 1289.02]  about pursuing
[1289.02 --> 1290.44]  a life of integrity.
[1291.16 --> 1292.72]  And James probes in
[1292.72 --> 1294.16]  and asks the hard questions.
[1295.16 --> 1296.74]  Is this a living faith?
[1297.36 --> 1298.18]  And if it is,
[1298.52 --> 1299.54]  it needs to be manifest
[1299.54 --> 1300.22]  in actions.
[1304.44 --> 1305.68]  Second, I'll just say this.
[1306.16 --> 1306.92]  I think we should let
[1306.92 --> 1307.60]  the book of James
[1307.60 --> 1308.56]  make us uncomfortable.
[1309.16 --> 1309.66]  You know, some books
[1309.66 --> 1310.48]  are deep in comfort.
[1310.90 --> 1311.40]  And some books
[1311.40 --> 1312.24]  are meant to shake us up
[1312.24 --> 1312.92]  and I think we just need
[1312.92 --> 1313.74]  to come to this book
[1313.74 --> 1314.64]  saying, okay, Lord,
[1315.40 --> 1316.18]  teach me.
[1316.94 --> 1318.20]  I come with open ears
[1318.20 --> 1319.10]  and open eyes
[1319.10 --> 1321.20]  and I want to use this time
[1321.20 --> 1321.86]  with this book
[1321.86 --> 1322.80]  for your Holy Spirit
[1322.80 --> 1323.76]  to open up in me
[1323.76 --> 1324.52]  the incongruity
[1324.52 --> 1325.54]  and the hypocrisy
[1325.54 --> 1326.56]  and the inconsistency
[1326.56 --> 1327.78]  and for you to use
[1327.78 --> 1328.38]  that awareness
[1328.38 --> 1329.34]  to grow me
[1329.34 --> 1330.24]  as a disciple
[1330.24 --> 1331.54]  who is less hypocritical
[1331.54 --> 1332.68]  and leaning into
[1332.68 --> 1333.60]  wholeness and integrity
[1333.60 --> 1334.82]  that Jesus himself
[1334.82 --> 1335.56]  can give us.
[1336.16 --> 1336.90]  I think this is
[1336.90 --> 1337.72]  a good season for that.
[1337.72 --> 1341.00]  And that also connects,
[1341.12 --> 1341.24]  I think,
[1341.28 --> 1341.80]  to the good news
[1341.80 --> 1342.30]  of this book.
[1342.86 --> 1343.48]  You know, this week,
[1343.74 --> 1345.02]  Val, our discipleship coordinator,
[1345.18 --> 1346.06]  I was summarizing my sermon
[1346.06 --> 1346.32]  to her
[1346.32 --> 1346.74]  because she wrote
[1346.74 --> 1347.64]  the small group questions
[1347.64 --> 1349.02]  and after I summarized it,
[1349.02 --> 1349.28]  she said,
[1349.34 --> 1350.26]  Dave, where's the good news?
[1350.36 --> 1350.54]  I'm like,
[1350.64 --> 1351.68]  that's a very good question.
[1352.04 --> 1352.72]  Where's the good news?
[1352.82 --> 1354.06]  James is a very challenging book
[1354.06 --> 1354.84]  and the good news is,
[1354.90 --> 1355.96]  and this is so powerful,
[1356.54 --> 1358.14]  James does not write this book
[1358.14 --> 1359.20]  to beat Christians
[1359.20 --> 1359.90]  over the head
[1359.90 --> 1360.90]  with difficult rules
[1360.90 --> 1361.52]  and regulations
[1361.52 --> 1362.46]  on how to follow him.
[1362.92 --> 1363.80]  James, number one,
[1363.86 --> 1364.26]  assumes
[1364.26 --> 1366.24]  that we can grow.
[1367.72 --> 1369.18]  He assumes
[1369.18 --> 1371.00]  by the work of Jesus
[1371.00 --> 1372.14]  through the power
[1372.14 --> 1372.72]  of the Spirit
[1372.72 --> 1373.92]  that the church
[1373.92 --> 1375.06]  can grow,
[1375.76 --> 1377.06]  that we can move
[1377.06 --> 1378.90]  from radical hypocrisy
[1378.90 --> 1380.62]  to increasing levels
[1380.62 --> 1381.38]  of integrity
[1381.38 --> 1382.70]  between what we believe
[1382.70 --> 1383.30]  and what we live.
[1383.36 --> 1384.02]  Isn't that beautiful?
[1384.88 --> 1385.46]  And James,
[1385.62 --> 1385.80]  you know,
[1385.84 --> 1387.12]  he has a very powerful view
[1387.12 --> 1387.42]  of God
[1387.42 --> 1388.34]  who is merciful
[1388.34 --> 1389.82]  and compassionate,
[1389.82 --> 1390.56]  and he knows
[1390.56 --> 1391.22]  that God is there
[1391.22 --> 1391.72]  to help us
[1391.72 --> 1393.14]  every time we fail,
[1393.44 --> 1394.56]  every time we fall flat
[1394.56 --> 1395.12]  on our face
[1395.12 --> 1395.80]  and disobedience,
[1395.98 --> 1397.12]  and Christ in His grace
[1397.12 --> 1397.96]  will pick us up,
[1398.88 --> 1399.70]  reveal the depth
[1399.70 --> 1400.50]  of His compassion,
[1400.96 --> 1402.66]  and equip us
[1402.66 --> 1403.90]  by the power
[1403.90 --> 1404.54]  of the Spirit
[1404.54 --> 1406.34]  to stand firm
[1406.34 --> 1407.38]  and grow.
[1408.18 --> 1409.16]  Isn't that good news?
[1410.08 --> 1411.10]  James assumes
[1411.10 --> 1411.80]  that the Jesus
[1411.80 --> 1413.16]  who died and rose
[1413.16 --> 1414.48]  will walk with the church
[1414.48 --> 1415.32]  and enable them
[1415.32 --> 1416.12]  by His power
[1416.12 --> 1417.74]  with their cooperation
[1417.74 --> 1419.32]  to become people
[1419.32 --> 1419.92]  of integrity,
[1420.74 --> 1421.96]  people who are whole,
[1422.50 --> 1424.26]  people who pursue perfection.
[1424.26 --> 1424.38]  perfection.
[1425.40 --> 1426.28]  That's good news.
[1429.94 --> 1430.68]  Now let me finish
[1430.68 --> 1431.20]  with a story
[1431.20 --> 1432.40]  about James.
[1433.02 --> 1434.06]  Not James the Bible,
[1435.08 --> 1435.96]  but James Park,
[1436.30 --> 1437.00]  who is part of our church.
[1437.08 --> 1437.52]  James, are you here
[1437.52 --> 1437.96]  this morning?
[1438.28 --> 1439.18]  Were you in the 9 a.m. church?
[1439.26 --> 1440.00]  There you are, James.
[1440.44 --> 1441.28]  James gave me permission
[1441.28 --> 1442.02]  to share the story,
[1442.10 --> 1442.76]  and I was like,
[1442.84 --> 1443.60]  why did I do that?
[1445.10 --> 1445.86]  James and Sarah,
[1446.06 --> 1447.00]  they're fairly new
[1447.00 --> 1447.52]  to our church.
[1447.64 --> 1448.24]  They had us over
[1448.24 --> 1449.06]  last week,
[1449.08 --> 1449.54]  and we prayed
[1449.54 --> 1450.12]  because they just moved
[1450.12 --> 1450.76]  into a new home,
[1451.02 --> 1451.92]  and we just praised the Lord
[1451.92 --> 1452.68]  for the way He brought you
[1452.68 --> 1453.12]  to our church,
[1453.12 --> 1454.04]  but also your story
[1454.04 --> 1455.00]  because as we were sharing
[1455.00 --> 1455.46]  in your home,
[1455.54 --> 1456.16]  you talked about
[1456.16 --> 1457.44]  how you came to faith,
[1457.56 --> 1458.74]  and James came to Canada
[1458.74 --> 1459.74]  as a young person,
[1459.92 --> 1461.66]  as a high school student,
[1462.24 --> 1462.86]  and then he moved
[1462.86 --> 1463.74]  his way over to UBC,
[1464.10 --> 1464.72]  did not grow up
[1464.72 --> 1465.44]  in a Christian family,
[1465.54 --> 1466.00]  and on UBC,
[1466.14 --> 1466.72]  like every student,
[1466.84 --> 1468.24]  James wanted to find community,
[1468.40 --> 1469.14]  find some friends,
[1469.76 --> 1470.52]  and his strategy,
[1470.66 --> 1471.26]  a good strategy,
[1471.26 --> 1472.88]  was to find an on-campus club,
[1473.32 --> 1473.98]  and I know perhaps
[1473.98 --> 1474.66]  our students right now
[1474.66 --> 1475.46]  are doing the same thing.
[1476.10 --> 1477.30]  He got to know one club
[1477.30 --> 1478.44]  and got involved in that club
[1478.44 --> 1479.30]  and realized pretty quickly,
[1479.42 --> 1479.94]  okay, this is not
[1479.94 --> 1480.88]  a healthy club.
[1481.20 --> 1481.98]  This is not a club
[1481.98 --> 1483.14]  that's going to nurture my soul,
[1483.14 --> 1484.28]  and this is not
[1484.28 --> 1484.88]  what I'm looking for.
[1484.92 --> 1485.38]  He's not someone
[1485.38 --> 1486.06]  who's not a believer.
[1486.64 --> 1487.72]  And then James was invited
[1487.72 --> 1488.64]  by someone in Burnaby
[1488.64 --> 1490.38]  to a Korean Christian club,
[1490.74 --> 1491.36]  and he said,
[1491.46 --> 1492.84]  I was a little weirded out by it.
[1493.48 --> 1494.40]  They're strange people,
[1495.24 --> 1496.32]  but he said what he learned
[1496.32 --> 1497.18]  early on is that
[1497.18 --> 1498.92]  these people lived differently,
[1499.92 --> 1501.98]  that there's something unique
[1501.98 --> 1502.40]  about the way
[1502.40 --> 1503.46]  they talked to each other,
[1504.12 --> 1504.84]  the way they cared
[1504.84 --> 1505.44]  for one another,
[1505.72 --> 1506.56]  and the way they did
[1506.56 --> 1508.06]  their academic work together.
[1508.06 --> 1509.96]  And as he saw them,
[1510.00 --> 1510.94]  as he spent time with them,
[1510.98 --> 1511.38]  he realized,
[1511.50 --> 1512.02]  now there's something
[1512.02 --> 1512.50]  different here
[1512.50 --> 1513.64]  that I want to pursue.
[1514.32 --> 1515.16]  And I'm going to let James
[1515.16 --> 1516.28]  one day tell his whole story
[1516.28 --> 1516.80]  in all of life.
[1516.84 --> 1517.36]  Interview is not
[1517.36 --> 1518.10]  my whole story to tell,
[1518.38 --> 1519.24]  but here's the point.
[1520.46 --> 1521.22]  James was able
[1521.22 --> 1522.84]  to taste the character
[1522.84 --> 1523.42]  of Jesus
[1523.42 --> 1525.66]  through the actions
[1525.66 --> 1527.66]  of Christian students
[1527.66 --> 1528.44]  on campus.
[1528.98 --> 1530.30]  And Jesus used
[1530.30 --> 1531.08]  those students
[1531.08 --> 1531.90]  who were young
[1531.90 --> 1532.74]  and I'm sure immature
[1532.74 --> 1533.56]  in a variety of ways,
[1533.78 --> 1534.44]  but they lived out
[1534.44 --> 1535.24]  their faith sufficiently
[1535.24 --> 1535.80]  that James says,
[1536.02 --> 1537.68]  I want what it is
[1537.68 --> 1538.06]  they have
[1538.06 --> 1539.12]  because I can see
[1539.12 --> 1540.40]  good news.
[1541.36 --> 1542.52]  Praise the Lord, James,
[1543.14 --> 1543.90]  that you're here
[1543.90 --> 1545.06]  through the grace of Jesus
[1545.06 --> 1546.00]  through the action
[1546.00 --> 1546.70]  of believers.
[1547.46 --> 1548.24]  And my prayer
[1548.24 --> 1549.48]  as we work through this book
[1549.48 --> 1551.44]  is precisely this,
[1551.68 --> 1553.04]  that God would move us
[1553.04 --> 1553.86]  from hypocrisy
[1553.86 --> 1554.82]  towards integrity
[1554.82 --> 1556.26]  and as we live out
[1556.26 --> 1556.80]  our faith
[1556.80 --> 1557.58]  in ordinary ways
[1557.58 --> 1558.40]  in our family neighborhood,
[1558.56 --> 1559.52]  words and deeds,
[1560.44 --> 1561.24]  that our friends,
[1561.42 --> 1561.80]  co-workers,
[1562.04 --> 1562.42]  and neighbors
[1562.42 --> 1563.02]  would see
[1563.02 --> 1564.26]  integrated lives.
[1564.26 --> 1565.66]  and they would get
[1565.66 --> 1567.04]  a taste of the love
[1567.04 --> 1568.26]  of Jesus Christ
[1568.26 --> 1570.54]  through ordinary activity,
[1571.04 --> 1572.18]  that it would be visible
[1572.18 --> 1573.98]  even without words.
[1574.20 --> 1575.10]  And who knows,
[1575.54 --> 1576.46]  by the grace of Jesus,
[1576.58 --> 1577.12]  our friends,
[1577.30 --> 1577.70]  our neighbors,
[1577.80 --> 1578.34]  and co-workers
[1578.34 --> 1579.22]  would find themselves
[1579.22 --> 1580.24]  worshiping Jesus
[1580.24 --> 1582.26]  because they found life
[1582.26 --> 1583.48]  through the ministry
[1583.48 --> 1584.14]  of the church.
[1585.62 --> 1586.30]  Let's pray.
[1591.14 --> 1592.34]  Father, we want to thank you
[1592.34 --> 1592.94]  for this book.
[1594.26 --> 1596.52]  I thank you for inspiring James
[1596.52 --> 1597.48]  to write these words.
[1598.28 --> 1599.48]  I thank you for the way
[1599.48 --> 1600.40]  this has been a gift
[1600.40 --> 1601.12]  to the church
[1601.12 --> 1602.40]  for centuries.
[1602.80 --> 1603.32]  And so I pray
[1603.32 --> 1604.16]  as we begin this series
[1604.16 --> 1605.22]  that we would receive it.
[1605.96 --> 1607.12]  You'd give us open ears
[1607.12 --> 1608.50]  to hear what we need to hear
[1608.50 --> 1610.30]  and that you would minister
[1610.30 --> 1610.84]  to us
[1610.84 --> 1612.68]  and deepen our faith
[1612.68 --> 1614.04]  through it
[1614.04 --> 1616.00]  such that the faith
[1616.00 --> 1616.62]  we profess
[1616.62 --> 1617.98]  is faith that we live.
[1618.64 --> 1619.26]  And for that,
[1619.34 --> 1620.26]  Lord, we need you.
[1620.98 --> 1622.08]  We need your spirit.
[1622.08 --> 1622.80]  And so we ask
[1622.80 --> 1623.92]  that you'd pour your spirit
[1623.92 --> 1624.52]  on us
[1624.52 --> 1626.06]  so that people would see
[1626.06 --> 1626.54]  in us people
[1626.54 --> 1628.64]  who live what they believe.
[1629.68 --> 1630.54]  All glory
[1630.54 --> 1631.40]  and honor
[1631.40 --> 1632.60]  be to Jesus Christ.
[1633.26 --> 1633.54]  Amen.
