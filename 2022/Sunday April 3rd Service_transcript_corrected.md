[0.00 → 2.72] Well, good morning, Hope. It is good to be together.
[3.58 → 4.32] Good morning, Bill.
[4.70 → 7.78] You should know that Bill and BEV, they are here for both services.
[8.30 → 12.52] And you're in the front, and it is a privilege to preach two sermons to you, Bill.
[16.30 → 19.00] This is the part of the service where we gather around Christ's word,
[19.14 → 21.02] and we listen to him speak to us together.
[21.40 → 23.86] And we're going to continue our series in the Gospel of John,
[24.26 → 27.06] looking at the longest single recorded prayer of Jesus.
[27.06 → 31.40] And so if you have your Bible, digital or physical, turn with me to John chapter 17.
[33.00 → 36.84] And I should admit to you at the outset that this is one of the hardest sermons for me.
[37.54 → 41.36] I should say the most dense passages for me to put into one sermon.
[41.56 → 43.48] So we're going to do our best.
[44.20 → 46.10] This is Jesus' prayer before he's arrested.
[50.44 → 53.90] After Jesus said this, he looked upward to heaven and prayed,
[54.76 → 56.62] Father, the hour has come.
[57.06 → 61.32] Father, glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.
[62.00 → 64.24] For you granted him authority over all people,
[64.32 → 67.58] that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.
[68.32 → 69.74] Now this is eternal life,
[70.04 → 73.04] that they may know you, the only true God,
[73.30 → 75.20] and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[75.90 → 79.62] I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do.
[80.02 → 82.80] And now, Father, glorify me in your presence
[82.80 → 85.60] with the glory I had with you before the world began.
[85.60 → 89.84] I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world.
[90.04 → 91.04] They were yours.
[91.40 → 93.56] You gave them to me and have obeyed your word.
[94.06 → 97.32] Now they know everything you have given me comes from you.
[97.86 → 100.66] For I gave them the words you gave me, and they accepted them.
[101.18 → 103.16] They knew with certainty that I came from you,
[103.20 → 104.90] and they believed that you sent me.
[104.90 → 106.80] I pray for them.
[107.30 → 110.72] I'm not praying for the world, but for those you have given me,
[111.56 → 112.50] for they are yours.
[113.32 → 116.38] All I have is yours, and all you have is mine.
[116.52 → 118.58] All glory has come to me through them.
[119.08 → 121.10] I remain in the world no longer,
[121.40 → 122.96] but they are still in the world,
[123.42 → 124.62] and I am coming to you.
[125.62 → 128.30] Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name,
[128.56 → 129.78] the name you gave me,
[129.88 → 132.24] so that they may be one as we are one.
[133.00 → 134.70] While I was with them, I protected them
[134.70 → 136.86] and kept them safe by that name you gave me.
[137.22 → 139.98] None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction
[139.98 → 141.72] so that the scripture would be fulfilled.
[142.62 → 144.26] I am coming to you now,
[144.64 → 146.78] but I say these things while I am still in the world
[146.78 → 149.88] so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.
[150.70 → 152.16] I have given them your word,
[152.78 → 154.14] and the world has hated them.
[154.62 → 157.24] For they are not of the world any more than I am not of the world.
[157.94 → 159.92] My prayer is not that you take them out of the world,
[160.00 → 162.04] but that you protect them from the evil one.
[163.02 → 165.74] They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.
[166.82 → 168.14] Sanctify them by the truth.
[168.82 → 170.06] Your word is truth.
[170.76 → 172.12] As you sent me into the world,
[172.12 → 174.28] I have sent them into the world.
[175.20 → 176.72] For them, I sanctify myself,
[176.82 → 179.16] that they too may truly be sanctified.
[180.34 → 181.96] My prayer is not for them alone.
[182.26 → 184.26] I pray also for those who will believe in me
[184.26 → 185.12] through their message,
[185.62 → 187.66] that all of them may be one, Father,
[187.80 → 190.04] just as you are in me, and I am in you.
[190.68 → 192.18] May they also be in us
[192.18 → 193.58] so that the world may believe
[193.58 → 195.38] that you have sent me.
[196.22 → 198.24] I have given them the glory that you gave me,
[198.30 → 199.84] that they may be one as we are one,
[199.98 → 201.48] I in them and you in me,
[201.64 → 204.38] so that they may be brought to complete unity.
[204.38 → 207.86] Then the world will know that you have sent me
[207.86 → 210.60] and I have loved them even as you have loved me.
[211.34 → 214.58] Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am
[214.58 → 215.90] and to see my glory,
[216.04 → 218.10] the glory you have given me because you love me
[218.10 → 219.84] before the creation of the world.
[221.02 → 223.18] Righteous Father, though the world does not know you,
[223.60 → 227.26] I know you and they know that you have sent me.
[227.88 → 229.28] I have made you known to them
[229.28 → 230.86] and they will continue to make you known
[230.86 → 234.14] in order that the love you have for me may be in them
[234.14 → 236.82] and that I myself may be in them.
[238.62 → 239.70] What a prayer, hey?
[246.10 → 247.40] Over the last number of years,
[247.50 → 249.54] there have been people who have moved into our city
[249.54 → 252.38] and into our church from various places in the world.
[253.50 → 255.56] And I love having conversation with families
[255.56 → 257.18] who are new to our church from different places
[257.18 → 259.44] and asking them what it was like to move to Canada,
[259.44 → 261.96] what it was like to leave their family, leave their home.
[262.80 → 264.02] And often when I ask,
[264.12 → 267.22] what was the most difficult part of leaving your home country,
[267.34 → 269.54] the answer I get is almost always the same.
[269.64 → 270.90] Aside from food,
[271.84 → 274.14] when I ask people what they miss the most about back home,
[274.20 → 274.88] do you know what they say?
[277.00 → 277.40] Family.
[278.42 → 282.34] The hardest part was saying goodbye to family and close friends.
[283.50 → 285.62] Maybe some of you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[285.62 → 288.06] You can still remember being at the airport
[288.06 → 291.06] or being at home sharing your last meal with them
[291.06 → 292.24] before you get on that plane.
[292.78 → 294.14] Those are sacred moments.
[294.66 → 297.38] And moments where you often want to say what you want to say.
[297.48 → 298.68] Your words of love for them.
[299.12 → 300.72] Your words of appreciation for them.
[301.20 → 303.60] Your words of appreciation for the season you've had together
[303.60 → 304.84] before you say goodbye.
[306.14 → 308.06] Those final moments are precious ones.
[308.06 → 314.74] John 17 is our window into Jesus' last moments with his disciples.
[315.12 → 317.54] Right after this prayer, Jesus is arrested.
[318.38 → 320.74] And in this short time he has with his disciples,
[321.30 → 323.78] we've seen over the last few weeks that he washes their feet,
[324.16 → 325.08] he shares a meal,
[325.18 → 328.34] and now Jesus' final words are a prayer.
[329.48 → 332.06] His last words are not just to his disciples,
[332.20 → 334.32] they are prayer for his disciples.
[334.32 → 338.22] And you can learn a lot about someone by how they pray.
[338.90 → 341.78] And we certainly learn a ton about the heart of Jesus
[341.78 → 344.80] in this prayer in John 17.
[345.42 → 348.38] It's a prayer where he asks for the Father to glorify him
[348.38 → 350.42] so that he would give glory to his Father.
[350.92 → 354.40] It's a prayer for protection over the small group of believers
[354.40 → 356.78] who are going to carry the message of Jesus' identity
[356.78 → 358.74] into the world after he ascends.
[358.74 → 361.86] And it's a prayer for unity.
[362.70 → 364.88] That the oneness of the church
[364.88 → 367.10] would proclaim the goodness of the gospel.
[367.84 → 369.86] And we're going to look at this prayer together.
[371.08 → 372.80] Now something I learned about John 17
[372.80 → 374.88] that I did not know before studying it
[374.88 → 376.68] is that there's a lot of closeness
[376.68 → 378.66] between Matthew 6, the Lord's Prayer,
[378.80 → 381.82] and this John 17, the other Lord's Prayer.
[382.38 → 383.88] The petitions mirror each other,
[383.92 → 384.66] and if I had more time,
[384.70 → 385.96] I'd walk through all the similarities.
[385.96 → 389.76] But today I'm going to show you the six key petitions in John 17.
[390.04 → 391.28] I'm going to work through them together.
[391.40 → 395.12] The six key requests that Jesus brings to his Father are,
[395.64 → 398.26] first, Father, glorify your Son,
[398.88 → 400.46] that your Son may glorify you.
[400.90 → 401.56] That's verse 1.
[401.98 → 405.64] Second, Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name,
[405.72 → 408.02] the name that you gave me, verse 11.
[408.68 → 411.32] Third, protect them from the evil one, verse 15.
[412.52 → 414.32] Sanctify them by the truth.
[414.32 → 416.48] Your word is truth, verse 17.
[417.56 → 420.24] May they be one Father in us,
[420.44 → 423.02] so that the world may believe that you have sent me,
[423.10 → 424.18] verse 20 to 23.
[424.32 → 427.22] And finally, Father, I want those you have given me
[427.22 → 428.74] to be with me where I am,
[429.16 → 431.66] and to see my glory, verse 24.
[433.06 → 435.28] So let's look at these specific petitions
[435.28 → 436.96] that Jesus makes to the Father together.
[437.16 → 439.56] First, Jesus prays for his glory
[439.56 → 441.10] and the glory of his Father.
[441.10 → 444.66] Father, glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.
[446.10 → 447.42] This is a very significant prayer,
[447.48 → 449.94] and that word glory brings in lots of dimensions to it.
[450.02 → 451.16] It's bringing exaltation.
[451.32 → 453.04] It's bringing acknowledgement of the dignity
[453.04 → 454.94] and the significance of some other.
[455.20 → 457.40] It's lifting someone who's worthy of praise.
[457.50 → 459.58] And Jesus is saying, glorify me, Father,
[459.84 → 461.80] that I would bring glory to you.
[462.82 → 465.58] And don't miss what Jesus' eyes are focused on
[465.58 → 466.48] in verses 1 to 5.
[466.56 → 467.74] They are the cross.
[467.74 → 470.62] Jesus is looking forward to his death.
[471.06 → 473.86] He's looking forward to the most humiliating way
[473.86 → 474.76] for someone to die.
[474.84 → 475.50] And he's saying, Father,
[475.80 → 477.86] would you bring glory to your Son
[477.86 → 479.76] as I go to the cross?
[480.56 → 482.50] And would I bring glory to you
[482.50 → 484.52] as I wipe away the sins of the world?
[484.82 → 486.08] Would I bring glory to you
[486.08 → 487.66] as I defeat the power of Satan
[487.66 → 489.06] and all the forces of darkness?
[489.30 → 490.96] Would you receive the glory
[490.96 → 494.24] in this act of self-sacrifice?
[494.34 → 496.56] Would I finish the work you've sent me to do
[496.56 → 497.58] and bring glory?
[499.00 → 500.50] And I want us to recognize this morning
[500.50 → 502.40] that even us gathering for worship
[502.40 → 506.50] is a testimony to what Jesus is praying for.
[506.90 → 508.58] Because what we just did in that last song,
[508.66 → 510.98] Anya's Day, that we have sung together,
[511.46 → 513.32] that is a song where we as the church today
[513.32 → 516.14] in our city acknowledge what Jesus has done.
[516.42 → 518.00] We bring glory to Jesus,
[518.12 → 519.24] who is worthy of our praise,
[519.30 → 520.82] and we bring glory to the Father
[520.82 → 523.08] as people who know that Jesus finished the work.
[523.08 → 524.94] This first part of the prayer
[524.94 → 528.08] is all about the glory of the Son and the Father.
[529.52 → 531.04] The second two petitions
[531.04 → 532.94] are petitions for protection.
[533.90 → 534.72] And I want us to know
[534.72 → 537.12] that there's a pretty sobering element to this prayer.
[537.38 → 538.66] Because Jesus names two realities
[538.66 → 540.52] that no Western Christian talks about much.
[540.56 → 541.10] I shouldn't say no.
[541.52 → 542.70] Two things we don't talk about enough.
[542.82 → 544.20] Number one, Jesus says
[544.20 → 545.96] the world is going to hate his disciples.
[546.90 → 548.64] I mean, that is not a popular teaching.
[548.86 → 550.26] The world's going to hate his disciples.
[550.26 → 552.86] Number two, there is an evil one, Satan,
[552.98 → 554.78] who's going to attack, divide, and destroy.
[555.92 → 557.76] And he's present and active in the world.
[558.84 → 561.02] So Jesus' first petition for protection is,
[561.50 → 562.72] Holy Father, verse 11,
[562.84 → 564.52] protect them by the power of your name,
[564.74 → 566.80] the name you gave me.
[567.82 → 568.94] And if you've been going with us
[568.94 → 569.92] throughout the series on John,
[570.00 → 571.24] you'll know that as Jesus goes
[571.24 → 572.82] through his ministry in the Gospel of John,
[573.08 → 575.10] he continually repeats this statement
[575.10 → 575.84] about his identity
[575.84 → 577.56] that is connecting him to the Father.
[577.56 → 579.60] He says, I am.
[580.26 → 581.94] And he names the good shepherd,
[582.40 → 584.34] the vine, the truth, the resurrection.
[584.76 → 586.92] He's identifying that he is one with the Father.
[587.72 → 588.92] But this prayer for protection
[588.92 → 590.66] has also got some layers to it.
[590.68 → 591.42] And if you have your Bible,
[591.78 → 592.86] if you have an NIV especially,
[592.98 → 594.24] you'll know that in the footnotes,
[594.50 → 596.10] it says one way of reading this prayer
[596.10 → 597.04] for protection is,
[597.72 → 601.26] keep them faithful to the power of your name.
[601.90 → 603.60] And I agree with the commentators who say,
[603.70 → 605.08] what Jesus is praying for
[605.08 → 606.50] is that the disciples,
[606.50 → 608.96] as they face pressure and persecution
[608.96 → 610.38] and all sorts of hostility,
[610.50 → 612.60] that they remain loyal to the name of Jesus.
[613.22 → 614.44] Or to put it a different way,
[614.64 → 616.54] that they not dilute the message
[616.54 → 619.70] or water down the Gospel
[619.70 → 622.30] out of a desire to be palatable
[622.30 → 625.32] and liked and safe in culture.
[626.90 → 628.46] Now that's Jesus' prayer for his disciples.
[629.46 → 631.28] I think it has a lot for us to hear
[631.28 → 632.70] in our own context.
[632.80 → 634.28] Now we don't face the kind of persecution
[634.28 → 635.34] that the disciples faced.
[635.34 → 636.44] Many of them were killed,
[636.44 → 637.86] beheaded, and murdered
[637.86 → 638.84] for what they believed,
[639.00 → 640.06] but there certainly is pressure.
[641.30 → 642.78] And that word to the church today,
[643.08 → 644.70] to remain loyal and faithful
[644.70 → 645.90] to the name of Jesus,
[646.08 → 647.54] is a word in season.
[649.74 → 652.10] Jesus then prays words of protection
[652.10 → 652.78] from Satan.
[653.38 → 654.72] And this is a mirror, perfectly,
[654.92 → 656.22] of Matthew 6 in the Lord's Prayer
[656.22 → 656.72] where he says,
[657.08 → 658.80] protect them from the evil one.
[659.76 → 661.14] And I just want to name at the outset,
[661.80 → 664.12] Jesus is naming the reality of Satan.
[664.58 → 666.00] He's naming the presence of Satan.
[666.00 → 667.74] And you know, as Christians in the West,
[668.10 → 669.34] we don't talk much about Satan,
[669.48 → 670.36] and the church doesn't feel
[670.36 → 671.62] too particularly threatened by him.
[671.76 → 672.90] Our culture thinks it's crazy.
[673.28 → 675.64] But Jesus finds Satan significant enough,
[675.68 → 676.20] hear this,
[676.82 → 679.18] to pray for the church's protection from him.
[680.02 → 681.06] That's pretty significant.
[682.02 → 683.86] He believes the divisive, destructive power
[683.86 → 685.14] of the evil one is sufficient
[685.14 → 687.70] that Jesus himself gives some of his last moments
[687.70 → 688.34] with his disciples
[688.34 → 690.60] to pray that the Father protect the church
[690.60 → 691.82] from Satan.
[692.34 → 693.34] And I think this petition
[693.34 → 695.36] is both a warning and a comfort for us today.
[695.36 → 696.84] Number one, the warning is,
[697.10 → 698.40] church, take Satan seriously.
[699.84 → 701.86] He is not some non-existence
[701.86 → 702.54] that has no threat.
[702.64 → 703.96] His work is present,
[704.16 → 705.54] his divisive work is real,
[705.78 → 707.10] and if we don't take him seriously,
[707.28 → 708.26] as C.S. Lewis puts it,
[708.50 → 709.60] Satan's delighted by that.
[710.34 → 711.30] He's not particularly threatened
[711.30 → 712.80] by churches that don't take Satan seriously,
[713.02 → 714.00] he's not particularly threatened
[714.00 → 715.62] by societies that deny his existence.
[715.90 → 717.48] But Jesus says, he's real.
[718.24 → 719.88] And I'm praying for your protection
[719.88 → 720.64] from the Father,
[720.78 → 722.60] from Satan's schemes.
[722.60 → 724.24] Secondly, though,
[724.52 → 725.22] there's comfort
[725.22 → 726.90] because it's Jesus
[726.90 → 728.04] who's praying for us.
[728.32 → 728.84] And it's Jesus
[728.84 → 730.72] who's praying to the Father for us.
[730.86 → 731.56] And we can trust
[731.56 → 732.00] that the Jesus
[732.00 → 733.34] who defeated Satan on the cross
[733.34 → 735.30] can entrust to the Father
[735.30 → 736.22] our protection.
[737.02 → 738.86] And the Father will protect his church.
[739.20 → 740.26] He will persevere
[740.26 → 741.72] and preserve his church
[741.72 → 743.04] from the Satan's work
[743.04 → 744.50] and all the powers of darkness.
[744.50 → 748.88] Then comes Jesus' fourth petition.
[750.48 → 751.40] Our growth.
[752.46 → 753.66] We read in verse 17,
[753.92 → 756.06] Sanctify them by the truth.
[756.78 → 759.16] Your word is truth.
[759.44 → 760.78] And we talked about this last week.
[761.64 → 763.72] How Jesus not only claims to be the truth,
[763.84 → 765.12] the way, the truth, and the life,
[765.36 → 767.44] he invites people to live in that truth.
[767.50 → 768.44] And what we have before us
[768.44 → 769.78] in the scripture is a record
[769.78 → 772.12] and a testimony to Christ
[772.12 → 773.34] as the truth.
[774.16 → 775.28] And as John Calvin puts it,
[775.30 → 776.04] we said this last week,
[776.30 → 778.66] Christ comes clothed to us
[778.66 → 779.88] by the word.
[779.96 → 781.06] And when we read the word,
[781.18 → 782.24] we are listening to Christ.
[782.34 → 783.24] As we study the word,
[783.30 → 784.68] we are studying how to follow Christ.
[784.86 → 786.54] And as we take the word in,
[786.70 → 787.40] we are being made
[787.40 → 788.56] in the likeness of Christ
[788.56 → 789.50] by the work of the Spirit.
[790.64 → 791.90] One commentator says
[791.90 → 792.86] that Jesus' prayer here
[792.86 → 793.54] is that his Father
[793.54 → 794.74] would move the future church,
[794.74 → 795.48] that's us,
[795.78 → 796.96] into a love affair
[796.96 → 797.82] with God's word
[797.82 → 799.10] so that the church
[799.10 → 800.52] would actually represent
[800.52 → 801.60] and mirror the love
[801.60 → 802.42] and the life of Jesus
[802.42 → 803.96] in our society today.
[807.06 → 808.40] Jesus starts the prayer
[808.40 → 809.64] on glory,
[809.74 → 810.94] for his and the Father's glory.
[811.04 → 811.96] He then prays specifically
[811.96 → 813.42] for his 12 disciples.
[813.92 → 815.34] And then the prayer moves out.
[815.44 → 816.44] The last two requests
[816.44 → 817.74] are for all believers
[817.74 → 820.20] that will hear about God,
[820.34 → 820.60] Jesus,
[821.10 → 822.44] by the gospel message
[822.44 → 823.08] of the disciples.
[823.42 → 824.34] Just think about this for a minute.
[824.34 → 825.20] Before I read this,
[825.78 → 826.92] every one of us here
[826.92 → 829.30] has decided to follow Christ
[829.30 → 830.46] because someone has spoken
[830.46 → 831.18] that word to us
[831.18 → 832.50] and we join the global church
[832.50 → 833.32] that has heard the message
[833.32 → 833.94] and responded.
[834.32 → 835.08] And it's beautiful to think
[835.08 → 835.78] that Jesus' prayer
[835.78 → 837.98] is for us here in this passage.
[839.06 → 840.44] And this is what Jesus prays.
[840.48 → 841.04] Verse 20.
[842.00 → 843.62] My prayer is not for them alone,
[843.70 → 844.60] his disciples alone.
[844.72 → 845.70] I pray also for those
[845.70 → 846.82] who will believe in me
[846.82 → 847.62] through their message,
[848.02 → 848.98] that all of them
[848.98 → 850.52] may be one Father,
[851.24 → 852.52] just as you are in me
[852.52 → 853.52] and I am in you.
[854.24 → 855.40] May they also be in us
[855.40 → 857.18] so that the world may believe
[857.18 → 858.38] that you have sent me.
[858.98 → 860.16] I've given them the glory
[860.16 → 861.04] that you gave me,
[861.14 → 862.06] that they may be one
[862.06 → 863.00] as we are one,
[863.12 → 863.84] I in them
[863.84 → 864.76] and you in me,
[865.00 → 866.04] so that they may be brought
[866.04 → 868.14] to complete unity.
[869.88 → 871.84] Then the world will know
[871.84 → 872.78] that you sent me
[872.78 → 873.74] and have loved me
[873.74 → 875.00] even, sorry,
[875.08 → 875.76] I have loved them
[875.76 → 877.08] even as you have loved me.
[878.56 → 879.66] Jesus' first petition
[879.66 → 880.92] for the global church,
[880.98 → 881.56] you might say,
[881.78 → 882.80] is a prayer for unity,
[883.70 → 884.66] a prayer for oneness.
[884.66 → 885.82] And I have to admit,
[885.96 → 886.86] I'm not sure how we should
[886.86 → 887.76] even hear this prayer
[887.76 → 889.18] in our current moment.
[889.86 → 891.22] I read over six years ago now
[891.22 → 892.24] that at the time,
[892.40 → 893.12] six years ago,
[893.38 → 894.08] there were roughly
[894.08 → 897.50] 36,000 denominations.
[898.94 → 901.78] 36,000 denominations.
[901.96 → 902.60] You know what that means?
[902.80 → 904.50] That means 36,000 times
[904.50 → 905.84] Christians were in a church together
[905.84 → 907.44] and some said to the others,
[907.60 → 908.84] this is so bad
[908.84 → 909.98] and I'm so unhappy
[909.98 → 910.70] that I'm going to start
[910.70 → 911.52] a new church.
[912.86 → 914.18] And a little self-reflection here,
[914.18 → 915.04] you know the church
[915.04 → 916.04] that is often the worst
[916.04 → 916.56] at division?
[917.46 → 918.74] The Reformed Church.
[919.88 → 920.20] Us.
[921.20 → 922.10] In fact, there are jokes,
[922.20 → 922.90] I told this in the night,
[922.94 → 923.54] I'm going to tell it again,
[923.64 → 924.26] there's a joke about
[924.26 → 924.94] a Reformed guy
[924.94 → 925.52] who was on an island
[925.52 → 926.12] by himself.
[926.24 → 927.56] They found him years later
[927.56 → 928.68] and they rescued him
[928.68 → 929.60] and they saw on the island
[929.60 → 930.54] all sorts of artifacts
[930.54 → 931.44] of him living by himself
[931.44 → 932.40] and they saw two churches.
[933.26 → 933.86] Two churches.
[934.46 → 935.12] And they asked him,
[935.42 → 936.08] what happened with,
[936.18 → 936.92] why is there two churches?
[937.02 → 937.14] He's like,
[937.18 → 937.90] well, I used to be part
[937.90 → 938.28] of that one
[938.28 → 939.24] but I wasn't happy there,
[939.30 → 939.98] it wasn't going well
[939.98 → 941.04] so I started a new church.
[941.70 → 942.42] That's the story.
[942.46 → 943.04] It's a joke
[943.04 → 944.48] but it's a sad joke
[944.48 → 945.72] and it's a sad reality
[945.72 → 946.42] on the nature
[946.42 → 947.24] of our division.
[948.50 → 949.14] And I don't think
[949.14 → 950.04] we often take Jesus
[950.04 → 950.98] seriously enough
[950.98 → 951.98] when he prays this prayer.
[952.14 → 953.10] And did you notice
[953.10 → 954.84] the logic of what he's saying?
[955.32 → 956.96] I pray that they may be one,
[957.22 → 957.96] I in them
[957.96 → 958.74] and they in me
[958.74 → 959.94] just as the Father is in me
[959.94 → 961.08] so that what?
[961.56 → 962.38] So that the world
[962.38 → 962.88] would believe
[962.88 → 963.76] that you have sent me.
[963.98 → 964.42] That is to say
[964.42 → 965.58] the unity of the church
[965.58 → 966.58] is what bears witness
[966.58 → 967.66] to the reality of Jesus
[967.66 → 968.24] as the Saviour.
[968.24 → 969.72] And the division
[969.72 → 970.72] of the church therefore
[970.72 → 972.34] undercuts the mission
[972.34 → 972.88] and the ministry
[972.88 → 973.44] to the world.
[974.46 → 975.96] That's a pretty serious thing
[975.96 → 976.78] for Jesus to say.
[977.38 → 978.54] The unity of the church
[978.54 → 979.76] is what bears witness
[979.76 → 980.60] to Christ in the world
[980.60 → 981.50] and here's how that works.
[982.02 → 983.04] If you read the New Testament
[983.04 → 984.22] specifically Galatians
[984.22 → 985.12] and Paul and Romans
[985.12 → 987.20] they're constantly celebrating
[987.20 → 988.64] and protecting unity
[988.64 → 989.98] because they see
[989.98 → 990.88] the witness of it.
[991.42 → 992.32] You know in Galatians 3
[992.32 → 993.54] Paul talks about
[993.54 → 994.58] how there's no male
[994.58 → 995.12] nor female
[995.12 → 996.08] Greek nor Jew
[996.08 → 997.18] slave nor free.
[997.18 → 999.04] They're all one in Christ.
[999.74 → 1000.68] And the image there
[1000.68 → 1001.52] is that the church
[1001.52 → 1002.22] was made up of
[1002.22 → 1003.12] all these different
[1003.12 → 1003.74] people groups.
[1004.12 → 1004.82] All these different
[1004.82 → 1005.74] sectors of society.
[1006.16 → 1007.22] And imagine this.
[1008.26 → 1009.10] Someone walking down
[1009.10 → 1009.44] the street
[1009.44 → 1010.48] they'd walk by a house church
[1010.48 → 1011.10] they're often visible
[1011.10 → 1011.66] from the road
[1011.66 → 1012.56] at least that's what I've read
[1012.56 → 1013.42] and they would see
[1013.42 → 1014.88] a slave and a slave owner
[1014.88 → 1015.90] a man and a woman
[1015.90 → 1016.88] children, adults
[1016.88 → 1017.74] and they'd see
[1017.74 → 1018.96] Jews and Greeks
[1018.96 → 1020.84] around the table together
[1020.84 → 1022.10] as family.
[1023.04 → 1023.72] They'd see them
[1023.72 → 1024.94] celebrating this meal together
[1024.94 → 1026.00] and they would be forced
[1026.00 → 1026.80] to ask
[1026.80 → 1027.88] how is it
[1027.88 → 1028.84] that these people
[1028.84 → 1029.88] who in other circumstances
[1029.88 → 1031.00] would never be together
[1031.00 → 1032.48] who are in different classes
[1032.48 → 1033.40] do not belong together
[1033.40 → 1034.56] how are they around the table
[1034.56 → 1035.70] as brothers and sisters
[1035.70 → 1036.88] and the only answer
[1036.88 → 1037.94] the church could give
[1037.94 → 1039.76] is it's the reconciling power
[1039.76 → 1040.78] of Jesus Christ.
[1041.32 → 1042.38] That's the only thing
[1042.38 → 1043.18] that brings them together
[1043.18 → 1044.02] into this family
[1044.02 → 1045.20] that is called the church
[1045.20 → 1046.26] where the spirit
[1046.26 → 1047.70] the water of baptism
[1047.70 → 1048.74] is thicker than blood.
[1049.74 → 1051.24] That was their mystery.
[1051.40 → 1052.00] That was their witness.
[1052.86 → 1053.60] We are united
[1053.60 → 1054.68] by nothing other
[1054.68 → 1055.72] than the power
[1055.72 → 1056.10] of Jesus
[1056.10 → 1056.64] and the power
[1056.64 → 1057.12] of the gospel
[1057.12 → 1057.88] breaks through
[1057.88 → 1058.76] the social boundaries
[1058.76 → 1060.26] and makes this family
[1060.26 → 1061.44] the new humanity
[1061.44 → 1062.40] that is the church
[1062.40 → 1064.44] and that unity
[1064.44 → 1066.22] points to Christ
[1066.22 → 1067.74] because the only thing
[1067.74 → 1068.60] that brings them together
[1068.60 → 1070.22] is Christ.
[1072.90 → 1073.50] Leslie Newborn
[1073.50 → 1074.10] makes a very
[1074.10 → 1075.04] he's a commentator
[1075.04 → 1075.42] on John
[1075.42 → 1075.86] he makes a very
[1075.86 → 1076.72] astute observation
[1076.72 → 1078.40] that many religions
[1078.40 → 1079.04] when they're started
[1079.04 → 1079.64] they have a leader
[1079.64 → 1080.32] who writes a book
[1080.32 → 1080.94] and gives that book
[1080.94 → 1081.70] to people to read.
[1081.70 → 1083.44] some leave a set
[1083.44 → 1084.38] of moral instructions
[1084.38 → 1085.16] some give a sort
[1085.16 → 1085.76] of a program
[1085.76 → 1086.30] to follow
[1086.30 → 1087.04] or ideals
[1087.04 → 1087.36] that you have
[1087.36 → 1087.92] to live into
[1087.92 → 1088.38] to be part
[1088.38 → 1088.90] of that religion.
[1089.28 → 1090.20] What Jesus does
[1090.20 → 1090.90] by contrast
[1090.90 → 1091.94] to all those options
[1091.94 → 1093.18] is he leaves
[1093.18 → 1093.82] a community.
[1095.10 → 1095.48] He leaves
[1095.48 → 1096.04] a group
[1096.04 → 1096.84] of disciples
[1096.84 → 1098.08] and he says
[1098.08 → 1098.48] to them
[1098.48 → 1099.72] you
[1099.72 → 1101.26] as you live
[1101.26 → 1102.08] as you work
[1102.08 → 1102.98] as you live
[1102.98 → 1103.64] as a family
[1103.64 → 1104.76] you are
[1104.76 → 1105.82] the witness
[1105.82 → 1107.48] of my resurrection.
[1108.02 → 1108.86] You together
[1108.86 → 1109.62] are the ones
[1109.62 → 1110.40] who will make known
[1110.40 → 1110.84] the good news
[1110.84 → 1111.16] of Jesus.
[1111.46 → 1112.12] As we put
[1112.12 → 1113.12] in modern terms
[1113.12 → 1113.86] I don't know
[1113.86 → 1114.14] if you've heard
[1114.14 → 1114.56] this before
[1114.56 → 1115.60] but the first Bible
[1115.60 → 1116.18] that most people
[1116.18 → 1116.70] ever read
[1116.70 → 1117.76] is the church.
[1119.16 → 1119.82] The first Bible
[1119.82 → 1120.44] that people will read
[1120.44 → 1121.50] their understanding
[1121.50 → 1122.20] of what the gospel
[1122.20 → 1122.88] is going to be
[1122.88 → 1123.30] Christians
[1123.30 → 1124.06] you and I
[1124.06 → 1124.96] in our ordinary lives
[1124.96 → 1126.96] living that out.
[1128.54 → 1129.62] And if they see
[1129.62 → 1130.24] division
[1130.24 → 1132.40] in the church
[1132.40 → 1133.74] that undercuts
[1133.74 → 1134.36] the witness.
[1135.46 → 1136.24] If they see
[1136.24 → 1137.14] Christians who can't
[1137.14 → 1138.08] get along
[1138.08 → 1139.24] that leads
[1139.24 → 1140.12] to confusion
[1140.12 → 1140.72] and I've had
[1140.72 → 1141.50] many people
[1141.50 → 1142.02] I should say
[1142.02 → 1142.58] a number of people
[1142.58 → 1142.96] who come into
[1142.96 → 1143.30] our membership
[1143.30 → 1143.66] classes
[1143.66 → 1144.14] who did not
[1144.14 → 1144.42] grow up
[1144.42 → 1144.80] in the church
[1144.80 → 1145.34] did not
[1145.34 → 1145.58] grow up
[1145.58 → 1146.16] as Christians
[1146.16 → 1146.80] and one of the
[1146.80 → 1147.22] first questions
[1147.22 → 1148.10] is what's
[1148.10 → 1148.88] with Christians?
[1149.00 → 1149.32] Why are there
[1149.32 → 1150.46] so many denominations?
[1150.82 → 1151.18] Why is there
[1151.18 → 1152.12] so much division
[1152.12 → 1152.90] in the church?
[1153.46 → 1154.00] And I just
[1154.00 → 1154.58] join them
[1154.58 → 1155.26] and lament
[1155.26 → 1156.64] the incredible
[1156.64 → 1157.34] infighting
[1157.34 → 1158.30] and division
[1158.30 → 1158.80] that has taken
[1158.80 → 1159.32] place in the
[1159.32 → 1160.00] history of the church.
[1163.60 → 1164.56] One of the most
[1164.56 → 1165.70] life-giving things
[1165.70 → 1167.12] about my ministry
[1167.12 → 1167.74] here and I know
[1167.74 → 1168.32] I speak for other
[1168.32 → 1169.16] pastors in our church
[1169.16 → 1169.94] one of the most
[1169.94 → 1170.90] life-giving things
[1170.90 → 1171.86] is the unity
[1171.86 → 1172.40] that we're seeing
[1172.40 → 1173.54] happen in our city
[1173.54 → 1174.64] and if you've been
[1174.64 → 1175.26] at Hope long enough
[1175.26 → 1175.82] you'll know that
[1175.82 → 1176.36] there's some pretty
[1176.36 → 1176.96] cool things that
[1176.96 → 1177.44] we're doing with
[1177.44 → 1178.22] other local churches
[1178.22 → 1179.18] and you'll know
[1179.18 → 1180.00] that we care a lot
[1180.00 → 1180.92] about what's happening
[1180.92 → 1181.64] in local churches.
[1181.82 → 1182.02] In fact,
[1182.40 → 1183.20] shortly after I came
[1183.20 → 1183.50] to Hope
[1183.50 → 1184.44] almost six years ago
[1184.44 → 1184.64] now,
[1184.74 → 1185.58] more than six years ago
[1185.58 → 1187.70] the elders freed me up
[1187.70 → 1188.20] and said
[1188.20 → 1189.30] we're allowed to give
[1189.30 → 1190.38] time to get to
[1190.38 → 1191.16] know local pastors
[1191.16 → 1192.24] get to know local churches
[1192.24 → 1193.44] and invest in
[1193.44 → 1194.70] the city initiatives
[1194.70 → 1195.38] that local churches
[1195.38 → 1195.74] are doing
[1195.74 → 1196.44] so that we can work
[1196.44 → 1196.86] together
[1196.86 → 1198.10] because we want
[1198.10 → 1198.98] to be the church
[1198.98 → 1199.52] of Coverdale
[1199.52 → 1200.10] and we want Hope
[1200.10 → 1200.78] to figure out
[1200.78 → 1201.58] how we can partner
[1201.58 → 1202.70] together for the good
[1202.70 → 1203.24] of the city
[1203.24 → 1204.22] with other believers
[1204.22 → 1205.66] and that has been
[1205.66 → 1206.22] amazing
[1206.22 → 1207.12] to meet with pastors
[1207.12 → 1207.96] on a monthly basis
[1207.96 → 1208.94] to pray with them
[1208.94 → 1210.18] to find initiatives
[1210.18 → 1210.98] and ways we can
[1210.98 → 1211.62] serve together
[1211.62 → 1212.82] so often a church
[1212.82 → 1213.82] has the best idea
[1213.82 → 1214.28] but they don't
[1214.28 → 1214.86] have the resources
[1214.86 → 1215.78] but when churches
[1215.78 → 1216.78] come together
[1216.78 → 1218.70] they serve
[1218.70 → 1219.68] and there's a
[1219.68 → 1220.50] beautiful witness
[1220.50 → 1221.86] in fact
[1221.86 → 1222.50] we've had some
[1222.50 → 1223.46] awkward
[1223.46 → 1224.48] but also humorous
[1224.48 → 1224.94] moments
[1224.94 → 1226.16] where people
[1226.16 → 1226.52] have come into
[1226.52 → 1227.00] our church
[1227.00 → 1227.82] and they're from
[1227.82 → 1228.52] a local church
[1228.52 → 1229.46] and they'll start
[1229.46 → 1230.18] trash talking
[1230.18 → 1230.70] their church
[1230.70 → 1231.06] and they'll be like
[1231.06 → 1231.60] oh man
[1231.60 → 1232.14] I just don't like
[1232.14 → 1232.56] how that preacher
[1232.56 → 1232.98] is preaching
[1232.98 → 1233.84] I don't like
[1233.84 → 1234.24] the vision
[1234.24 → 1234.68] of that church
[1234.68 → 1235.14] so we're coming
[1235.14 → 1235.46] to Hope
[1235.46 → 1236.14] and we'll have
[1236.14 → 1236.62] to cut them off
[1236.62 → 1236.94] and say hey
[1236.94 → 1237.40] just so you know
[1237.40 → 1237.86] we're friends
[1237.86 → 1238.50] with that pastor
[1238.50 → 1240.98] and we pray
[1240.98 → 1241.48] for that church
[1241.48 → 1241.92] by name
[1241.92 → 1243.08] at least once a month
[1243.08 → 1243.52] and then things
[1243.52 → 1243.98] get awkward
[1243.98 → 1245.26] but you should know
[1245.26 → 1245.78] that that's also
[1245.78 → 1246.36] reciprocated
[1246.36 → 1246.88] because the other
[1246.88 → 1247.40] paths we've had
[1247.40 → 1247.82] I mean
[1247.82 → 1248.30] I don't know
[1248.30 → 1248.86] a story of this
[1248.86 → 1249.28] but I know
[1249.28 → 1249.92] that if people
[1249.92 → 1250.46] from our church
[1250.46 → 1250.86] left
[1250.86 → 1251.46] they went to
[1251.46 → 1251.92] a local church
[1251.92 → 1252.32] the pastors
[1252.32 → 1253.12] will say the same
[1253.12 → 1253.42] thing
[1253.42 → 1254.80] they will say
[1254.80 → 1255.26] we're friends
[1255.26 → 1256.00] with Dave and Sid
[1256.00 → 1257.02] we are praying
[1257.02 → 1257.50] for your church
[1257.50 → 1258.24] in fact just this
[1258.24 → 1258.52] morning
[1258.52 → 1259.40] I had a text
[1259.40 → 1259.92] from two local
[1259.92 → 1260.40] pastors saying
[1260.40 → 1260.78] we're praying
[1260.78 → 1261.56] for your church
[1261.56 → 1262.66] praying that God
[1262.66 → 1263.56] moves in your
[1263.56 → 1263.98] community
[1263.98 → 1265.08] praying that the
[1265.08 → 1265.86] spirit is poured
[1265.86 → 1266.30] out on your
[1266.30 → 1267.04] worship service
[1267.04 → 1267.94] I think that's
[1267.94 → 1268.74] a beautiful thing
[1268.74 → 1270.02] and I want everyone
[1270.02 → 1270.62] who joins this
[1270.62 → 1271.02] church to know
[1271.02 → 1271.66] that I really
[1271.66 → 1272.94] believe that God
[1272.94 → 1273.42] is at work
[1273.42 → 1274.06] in our city
[1274.06 → 1275.22] bringing unity
[1275.22 → 1275.80] to churches
[1275.80 → 1277.76] that is proclaiming
[1277.76 → 1278.24] the gospel
[1278.24 → 1278.76] together
[1278.76 → 1279.76] in our city
[1279.76 → 1282.36] just in the last
[1282.36 → 1283.28] week and a bit
[1283.28 → 1283.96] let me name just
[1283.96 → 1284.54] a few things
[1284.54 → 1284.96] that have taken
[1284.96 → 1285.28] place
[1285.28 → 1285.86] our youth
[1285.86 → 1286.86] joined together
[1286.86 → 1287.26] with youth
[1287.26 → 1287.60] of different
[1287.60 → 1287.84] churches
[1287.84 → 1288.44] to make a video
[1288.44 → 1288.78] that's going to
[1288.78 → 1289.06] be shown
[1289.06 → 1289.64] on Good Friday
[1289.64 → 1290.92] and a cool part
[1290.92 → 1291.40] of that story
[1291.40 → 1292.12] is they finish
[1292.12 → 1292.50] filming
[1292.50 → 1292.92] they're doing
[1292.92 → 1293.14] a thing
[1293.14 → 1293.78] on the Apostles
[1293.78 → 1294.06] Creed
[1294.06 → 1294.88] they finish
[1294.88 → 1295.44] filming in this
[1295.44 → 1296.06] creative barn
[1296.06 → 1296.40] setting
[1296.40 → 1296.70] and they're all
[1296.70 → 1297.12] just standing
[1297.12 → 1297.46] there
[1297.46 → 1298.40] and somehow
[1298.40 → 1298.92] they all just
[1298.92 → 1299.36] started praying
[1299.36 → 1299.94] for each other
[1299.94 → 1301.28] for their churches
[1301.28 → 1302.28] for their families
[1302.28 → 1303.02] for their lives
[1303.02 → 1303.78] and there's this
[1303.78 → 1304.04] picture
[1304.04 → 1304.58] I think you saw
[1304.58 → 1305.14] it is on social media
[1305.14 → 1305.72] of just some of the
[1305.72 → 1306.10] youth praying
[1306.10 → 1306.48] for each other
[1306.48 → 1306.96] I think that's a
[1306.96 → 1307.72] that's a vision
[1307.72 → 1308.26] of the church
[1308.26 → 1308.98] that delights
[1308.98 → 1309.90] the heart of Christ
[1309.90 → 1310.98] to see these youth
[1310.98 → 1311.46] coming together
[1311.46 → 1311.80] and praying
[1311.80 → 1312.36] for one another
[1312.36 → 1313.60] last Sunday
[1313.60 → 1314.14] sunrise
[1314.14 → 1315.50] they had a worship
[1315.50 → 1315.80] service
[1315.80 → 1316.28] and they invited
[1316.28 → 1316.88] all the churches
[1316.88 → 1317.38] from the city
[1317.38 → 1318.06] to join them
[1318.06 → 1318.90] praying for the city
[1318.90 → 1319.64] praying for each other
[1319.64 → 1320.60] praying for transformation
[1320.60 → 1321.92] this week
[1321.92 → 1322.60] I know some people
[1322.60 → 1323.12] in our own church
[1323.12 → 1323.66] signed up
[1323.66 → 1324.80] for the 24-7
[1324.80 → 1325.52] prayer initiative
[1325.52 → 1326.52] that Pacific
[1326.52 → 1327.16] Community Church
[1327.16 → 1327.50] hosted
[1327.50 → 1328.68] you took a block
[1328.68 → 1329.02] of time
[1329.02 → 1329.60] you went to their
[1329.60 → 1329.88] building
[1329.88 → 1330.38] and you prayed
[1330.38 → 1330.96] for an hour
[1330.96 → 1331.82] for our church
[1331.82 → 1332.48] for their church
[1332.48 → 1332.96] for the city
[1332.96 → 1333.66] because we see
[1333.66 → 1334.46] ourselves together
[1334.46 → 1335.66] ministering in this
[1335.66 → 1336.60] place called Coverdale
[1336.60 → 1339.42] that's not to mention
[1339.42 → 1340.04] that in two weeks
[1340.04 → 1340.64] as Pastor Sid
[1340.64 → 1341.22] already mentioned
[1341.22 → 1342.64] we are going to
[1342.64 → 1343.14] get together
[1343.14 → 1343.90] on Good Friday
[1343.90 → 1344.84] with a whole group
[1344.84 → 1345.22] of churches
[1345.22 → 1347.10] and celebrate
[1347.10 → 1347.84] our unity
[1347.84 → 1348.62] around the cross
[1348.62 → 1350.14] in fact I remember
[1350.14 → 1351.52] probably five years ago
[1351.52 → 1352.26] now one of the first
[1352.26 → 1353.20] Good Friday services
[1353.20 → 1353.88] that I went to
[1353.88 → 1355.14] a pastor made the
[1355.14 → 1355.44] suggestion
[1355.44 → 1355.82] you know what we
[1355.82 → 1356.16] should do
[1356.16 → 1357.04] we should get all
[1357.04 → 1358.14] the sandwich boards
[1358.14 → 1359.40] the sandwich board
[1359.40 → 1360.14] signs for our churches
[1360.14 → 1360.64] and we should put them
[1360.64 → 1361.48] all in front of the
[1361.48 → 1361.74] building
[1361.74 → 1362.72] and so you know
[1362.72 → 1363.14] most churches
[1363.14 → 1363.76] are church plants
[1363.76 → 1364.16] in our city
[1364.16 → 1364.42] that don't have
[1364.42 → 1364.90] their own buildings
[1364.90 → 1365.80] so we all got
[1365.80 → 1366.56] these sandwich board
[1366.56 → 1367.28] signs for our church
[1367.28 → 1368.04] and we lined them
[1368.04 → 1369.00] up side by side
[1369.00 → 1369.72] and it was just
[1369.72 → 1370.74] beautiful to drive
[1370.74 → 1371.52] to church on Good
[1371.52 → 1372.02] Friday morning
[1372.02 → 1373.16] and see Coast Hills
[1373.16 → 1374.32] Cross Ridge
[1374.32 → 1374.72] Hope
[1374.72 → 1375.24] Pacific
[1375.24 → 1375.94] Sunrise
[1375.94 → 1376.46] all these different
[1376.46 → 1376.72] churches
[1376.72 → 1378.06] side by side
[1378.06 → 1379.30] even more beautiful
[1379.30 → 1379.92] was going into
[1379.92 → 1380.24] the building
[1380.24 → 1380.68] and seeing all
[1380.68 → 1381.16] these believers
[1381.16 → 1382.10] that I didn't know
[1382.10 → 1382.78] but they were there
[1382.78 → 1383.78] for the same reason
[1383.78 → 1384.84] they were there
[1384.84 → 1385.46] to celebrate
[1385.46 → 1386.70] and sing the praises
[1386.70 → 1387.68] of Jesus Christ
[1387.68 → 1388.52] and recognize
[1388.52 → 1389.84] that we are one church
[1389.84 → 1391.02] around the cross
[1391.02 → 1392.22] amen
[1392.22 → 1393.92] and I hope
[1393.92 → 1394.24] you are there
[1394.24 → 1394.72] in two weeks
[1394.72 → 1395.46] to be part of that
[1395.46 → 1397.68] I really believe
[1397.68 → 1398.64] that God
[1398.64 → 1399.44] seeks to bring
[1399.44 → 1399.78] unity
[1399.78 → 1400.88] to his churches
[1400.88 → 1401.80] now
[1401.80 → 1402.46] do the churches
[1402.46 → 1403.64] agree on everything
[1403.64 → 1405.62] no they do not
[1405.62 → 1407.16] does Pastor Chris
[1407.16 → 1407.56] West by
[1407.56 → 1408.26] at Sunrise Church
[1408.26 → 1409.00] make fun of me
[1409.00 → 1410.16] for baptizing babies
[1410.16 → 1411.80] yes he does
[1411.80 → 1413.80] is Pastor Chris
[1413.80 → 1414.28] wrong
[1414.28 → 1415.74] yes he is
[1415.74 → 1422.54] he is going to
[1422.54 → 1423.00] watch this
[1423.00 → 1423.52] and just shake
[1423.52 → 1423.88] his head
[1423.88 → 1426.30] but more seriously
[1426.30 → 1427.08] even on an internal
[1427.08 → 1427.50] basis
[1427.50 → 1429.24] there is no question
[1429.24 → 1429.68] that COVID
[1429.68 → 1430.56] has been a challenging
[1430.56 → 1431.40] season for churches
[1431.40 → 1433.34] I have heard a lot
[1433.34 → 1434.10] of stories of division
[1434.10 → 1434.84] in our families
[1434.84 → 1435.88] division between churches
[1435.88 → 1436.84] division just between
[1436.84 → 1437.74] members of churches
[1437.74 → 1438.62] and people saying
[1438.62 → 1439.36] I am done with church
[1439.36 → 1440.22] because of the conflict
[1440.22 → 1440.84] and all the stuff
[1440.84 → 1441.64] that COVID has brought
[1441.64 → 1442.90] and I have prayed
[1442.90 → 1444.12] more for the unity
[1444.12 → 1444.96] of our church
[1444.96 → 1446.36] and our churches
[1446.36 → 1446.88] in the city
[1446.88 → 1447.72] in the last two years
[1447.72 → 1448.18] than I have ever
[1448.18 → 1448.80] prayed before
[1448.80 → 1450.66] because I really think
[1450.66 → 1451.48] we don't take Jesus
[1451.48 → 1452.50] seriously when he says
[1452.50 → 1453.94] I pray that they may be
[1453.94 → 1454.80] one
[1454.80 → 1456.52] and that their
[1456.52 → 1457.46] oneness
[1457.46 → 1458.24] will bear witness
[1458.24 → 1459.08] to the resurrection
[1459.08 → 1460.66] that people will know
[1460.66 → 1461.60] that Jesus came
[1461.60 → 1462.76] as they see believers
[1462.76 → 1463.84] living in meaningful
[1463.84 → 1465.68] true unity
[1465.68 → 1468.06] and this is the right
[1468.06 → 1468.96] season for us to say
[1468.96 → 1469.70] what does that look like
[1469.70 → 1470.06] for me
[1470.06 → 1471.72] what path of reconciliation
[1471.72 → 1472.78] do I need to take
[1472.78 → 1473.66] and we are going to come back
[1473.66 → 1474.64] to that in just a few minutes
[1474.64 → 1475.54] with communion
[1475.54 → 1478.84] Jesus' final petition
[1478.84 → 1481.12] in this prayer
[1481.12 → 1481.98] is in verse 24
[1481.98 → 1482.70] where he says
[1482.70 → 1483.92] Father I want those
[1483.92 → 1484.70] you have given me
[1484.70 → 1485.62] to be with me
[1485.62 → 1486.44] where I am
[1486.44 → 1488.70] and to see my glory
[1488.70 → 1490.40] Jesus' petition here
[1490.40 → 1491.22] is for the future
[1491.22 → 1492.62] in some sense
[1492.62 → 1493.46] the great comfort
[1493.46 → 1494.72] that all believers have
[1494.72 → 1495.90] is if we die in Christ
[1495.90 → 1497.26] we are waking up
[1497.26 → 1497.72] in the presence
[1497.72 → 1498.72] of Christ in paradise
[1498.72 → 1499.66] that's what he says
[1499.66 → 1500.48] to the thief on the cross
[1500.48 → 1501.32] he says today
[1501.32 → 1503.04] today you will be with me
[1503.04 → 1503.68] so our comfort
[1503.68 → 1504.48] is that we are going
[1504.48 → 1505.14] to be with Christ
[1505.14 → 1505.68] if we die
[1505.68 → 1506.32] when we die
[1506.32 → 1507.40] but the hope
[1507.40 → 1508.82] of every believer
[1508.82 → 1510.00] is that the Jesus
[1510.00 → 1511.48] who was with his disciples
[1511.48 → 1512.66] ascended to be with the Father
[1512.66 → 1513.46] after his resurrection
[1513.46 → 1515.60] he is coming back
[1515.60 → 1518.56] and we are going to see
[1518.56 → 1520.24] his glory
[1520.24 → 1522.40] there is coming a day
[1522.40 → 1523.60] where we will behold
[1523.60 → 1525.38] the glory of Jesus
[1525.38 → 1527.06] together
[1527.06 → 1529.16] and as Paul says
[1529.16 → 1530.36] those who share
[1530.36 → 1531.68] in his suffering
[1531.68 → 1533.18] will share
[1533.18 → 1534.16] in his glory
[1534.16 → 1536.84] and the Father
[1536.84 → 1537.48] who protects
[1537.48 → 1538.10] the church
[1538.10 → 1539.56] will enable
[1539.56 → 1540.60] by his grace
[1540.60 → 1541.38] us to share
[1541.38 → 1542.00] in the glory
[1542.00 → 1542.86] of his Son
[1542.86 → 1546.02] when that happens
[1546.02 → 1547.52] every petition
[1547.52 → 1548.38] in this prayer
[1548.38 → 1548.78] of Jesus
[1548.78 → 1549.64] is going to be
[1549.64 → 1550.36] fulfilled fully
[1550.36 → 1552.18] there will be
[1552.18 → 1553.68] no more hatred
[1553.68 → 1555.06] towards the church
[1555.06 → 1556.54] what good news
[1556.54 → 1556.84] that is
[1556.84 → 1557.26] for believers
[1557.26 → 1557.66] who are meeting
[1557.66 → 1558.08] in secret
[1558.08 → 1558.64] right now
[1558.64 → 1559.36] whose lives
[1559.36 → 1559.80] are threatened
[1559.80 → 1560.50] because of what
[1560.50 → 1561.04] they believe
[1561.04 → 1561.90] there will be
[1561.90 → 1562.54] no more threats
[1562.54 → 1563.18] against the church
[1563.18 → 1563.82] because Christ
[1563.82 → 1564.40] will have renewed
[1564.40 → 1565.02] his creation
[1565.02 → 1565.72] there will be
[1565.72 → 1566.50] no more temptation
[1566.50 → 1567.22] and division
[1567.22 → 1568.10] and attack
[1568.10 → 1568.50] on the church
[1568.50 → 1569.08] from Satan
[1569.08 → 1570.30] because he is
[1570.30 → 1570.96] fully done away
[1570.96 → 1571.70] with by Christ's
[1571.70 → 1571.98] return
[1571.98 → 1574.96] imagine this
[1574.96 → 1576.26] we will be
[1576.26 → 1577.76] fully sanctified
[1577.76 → 1580.04] no more trapped
[1580.04 → 1580.68] by sin
[1580.68 → 1581.52] no more cycles
[1581.52 → 1582.16] of pain
[1582.16 → 1582.78] and misery
[1582.78 → 1583.36] and division
[1583.36 → 1583.82] in our families
[1583.82 → 1584.40] we will be
[1584.40 → 1585.82] fully alive
[1585.82 → 1586.52] as we were
[1586.52 → 1587.38] created to live
[1587.38 → 1587.74] in the very
[1587.74 → 1588.54] presence of Jesus
[1588.54 → 1589.96] sanctified
[1589.96 → 1591.72] and maybe most
[1591.72 → 1592.52] exciting for me
[1592.52 → 1594.00] is we as the
[1594.00 → 1594.74] church of Jesus
[1594.74 → 1596.24] will be one
[1596.24 → 1599.62] imagine it
[1599.62 → 1600.08] this is how
[1600.08 → 1600.82] revelation gives
[1600.82 → 1601.30] us the image
[1601.30 → 1602.42] when Jesus returns
[1602.42 → 1602.80] there will be
[1602.80 → 1603.72] people from every
[1603.72 → 1604.10] tribe
[1604.10 → 1604.72] every background
[1604.72 → 1605.38] every ethnicity
[1605.38 → 1606.58] every language
[1606.58 → 1607.94] circling around
[1607.94 → 1608.76] the throne of
[1608.76 → 1609.56] Jesus the Lamb
[1609.56 → 1610.14] and the Father
[1610.14 → 1611.10] and bowing
[1611.10 → 1611.68] before him
[1611.68 → 1612.48] in worship
[1612.48 → 1614.64] that's how
[1614.64 → 1615.30] the end
[1615.30 → 1616.36] takes place
[1616.36 → 1618.04] the church
[1618.04 → 1619.54] will be united
[1619.54 → 1620.38] the tattered
[1620.38 → 1621.68] divided fabric
[1621.68 → 1622.28] of the church
[1622.28 → 1622.64] of Jesus
[1622.64 → 1623.64] will be mended
[1623.64 → 1624.70] fully
[1624.70 → 1626.54] and our future
[1626.54 → 1627.54] in Christ
[1627.54 → 1629.26] is one body
[1629.26 → 1630.96] brothers and sisters
[1630.96 → 1631.90] scattered around
[1631.90 → 1633.26] the entire creation
[1633.26 → 1635.06] honouring and exalting
[1635.06 → 1636.02] and giving glory
[1636.02 → 1636.72] to the Father
[1636.72 → 1637.84] and Son
[1637.84 → 1639.16] and Holy Spirit
[1639.16 → 1640.30] Amen
[1640.30 → 1642.54] let's pray
[1642.54 → 1646.64] Father we thank you
[1646.64 → 1647.08] that Jesus
[1647.08 → 1648.04] finished the work
[1648.04 → 1649.00] you sent him to do
[1649.00 → 1650.16] and we thank you
[1650.16 → 1650.78] that the tomb
[1650.78 → 1651.54] is empty
[1651.54 → 1652.82] and that the glory
[1652.82 → 1653.26] of Jesus
[1653.26 → 1653.96] was seen
[1653.96 → 1655.02] in the strange
[1655.02 → 1656.32] and incredible
[1656.32 → 1657.22] act of his
[1657.22 → 1658.08] self-sacrifice
[1658.08 → 1658.74] on the cross
[1658.74 → 1661.06] Lord we pray
[1661.06 → 1661.70] for protection
[1661.70 → 1663.98] we pray that you
[1663.98 → 1664.44] would make us
[1664.44 → 1665.70] faithful to your name
[1665.70 → 1666.76] in our circumstances
[1666.76 → 1667.54] in our culture
[1667.54 → 1668.74] we pray that you
[1668.74 → 1669.24] would protect us
[1669.24 → 1670.36] from the devil's schemes
[1670.36 → 1671.02] to divide
[1671.02 → 1671.82] and to destroy
[1671.82 → 1672.94] us in this season
[1672.94 → 1675.04] Lord would you
[1675.04 → 1676.06] make us one
[1676.06 → 1678.88] would you enable us
[1678.88 → 1680.12] to live in unity
[1680.12 → 1682.46] so that our city
[1682.46 → 1683.44] our neighbours
[1683.44 → 1684.50] our friends
[1684.50 → 1685.52] would see that
[1685.52 → 1686.48] Christ is Lord
[1686.48 → 1687.50] Amen
