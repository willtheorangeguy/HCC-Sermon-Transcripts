[0.00 --> 7.92]  It's just so funny.
[8.76 --> 10.88]  They warned me that this would happen.
[11.42 --> 16.52]  I will try my best to highlight the main aspects of 1 Corinthians 12,
[16.68 --> 21.40]  because I don't think you can say that you did a full series on unity of the church
[21.40 --> 23.26]  without looking at 1 Corinthians 12.
[23.86 --> 29.70]  And so I had two main aspects that I was going to highlight from the verses today.
[30.00 --> 34.92]  I will do my best to concisely deliver them to you so that we are blessed.
[35.34 --> 39.62]  But I must say, with everything that we went through today,
[39.84 --> 47.02]  celebrating graduation, witnessing the journey of faith of our Cornerstone students going up to youth,
[47.26 --> 51.06]  and our new members bringing in, and this is the most important part too,
[51.06 --> 55.04]  they're bringing in new gifts, which is what we're looking at today.
[55.24 --> 58.40]  And they have, they all have gifts.
[58.40 --> 60.14]  That is the main point of the sermon.
[60.22 --> 61.52]  I can just say amen right now.
[61.94 --> 68.78]  But every one of you, every one of you, especially including our new members this morning,
[69.14 --> 74.70]  bring in new diverse gifts that will bless this church and will bless our community.
[75.32 --> 78.32]  And so please turn with me if you have your Bibles with you.
[78.32 --> 82.30]  We will quickly run through 1 Corinthians chapter 12.
[83.10 --> 85.84]  We will start reading at verse 12.
[86.90 --> 89.66]  1 Corinthians 12, verse 12.
[96.56 --> 99.02]  This is the Word of God for us this morning.
[99.02 --> 124.68]  And I skip down to verse 18.
[124.68 --> 141.66]  I skip down to verse 25.
[141.66 --> 167.74]  This is the Word of God.
[167.74 --> 170.48]  Thanks be to God.
[171.10 --> 173.88]  And so as I reflect on our sermon series on unity,
[174.38 --> 177.04]  I pondered on my own experience so far at Hope.
[177.82 --> 181.96]  I've been encouraged so much as I lead worship, as I preach occasionally,
[182.14 --> 186.36]  as I help out with youth, as I help out as best as I can in different ministries,
[186.68 --> 190.42]  of how I'm very encouraged by the Hope community,
[191.42 --> 193.86]  saying what a good job I've been doing here at Hope.
[193.86 --> 198.44]  With this encouragement, I am still aware,
[198.68 --> 200.56]  even with this encouragement, I should say,
[200.82 --> 203.44]  I am still aware of the limits of my gifts.
[204.20 --> 208.14]  And so when it comes to examples of serving with hospitality,
[209.00 --> 211.90]  I cannot do, for example, what the Gruens do,
[212.22 --> 219.76]  or what Sonia and Rob does on a regular occasion of serving and blessing others with their hospitality.
[219.76 --> 225.14]  And also, even having grown up as a youth pastor for a significant part of my life,
[225.40 --> 229.42]  I can't imagine for a second now at this stage of my life,
[229.90 --> 233.78]  thinking that I can do anything like Misha is doing with the youth.
[234.88 --> 239.42]  And so the main point is, for the health and growth of the church,
[240.04 --> 241.28]  we need each other.
[241.74 --> 243.54]  We need each other's gifts.
[243.54 --> 251.98]  And I think the danger sometimes is that we either think that some of us have the most important gifts,
[252.52 --> 256.28]  or some of us think we can just do it all ourselves.
[257.78 --> 262.48]  And remember the four channels of grace that we heard from the lengthy sermon from last week.
[264.58 --> 268.48]  Apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer.
[268.48 --> 274.64]  What I want to highlight and emphasize is that these four practices,
[275.18 --> 278.76]  these four channels of grace are all communal practices.
[279.40 --> 280.46]  We do them together.
[281.74 --> 285.32]  This means one person cannot do all these four things.
[285.72 --> 287.60]  One person cannot do fellowship.
[287.88 --> 289.20]  That would just not be fellowship.
[289.84 --> 293.28]  One person breaking of bread, there is no meaning and significance.
[293.76 --> 294.32]  And so on.
[294.32 --> 298.22]  And as we look at our verses in 1 Corinthians,
[298.60 --> 300.98]  we look at, as I've said at the beginning,
[301.30 --> 303.68]  how everyone brings their gifts.
[304.42 --> 306.44]  That is the main first aspect.
[306.66 --> 310.44]  And it is the simple but the most important part,
[310.64 --> 316.48]  that every one of you here brings gifts to Christ's body.
[316.48 --> 324.46]  It is actually important that everyone brings their different gifts to the church.
[325.82 --> 328.76]  And so Pastor Dave keeps making the joke that our church,
[328.86 --> 330.98]  or any church, would be very boring,
[331.48 --> 333.34]  or I think the better description would be,
[333.44 --> 337.48]  it would be very chaotic if it was just full of Pastor Sid's.
[338.86 --> 341.40]  Or I would add to that, or Dave's.
[341.40 --> 343.62]  You know, how, yeah.
[343.82 --> 346.36]  But if it's full of Jonathan's, I don't know.
[346.44 --> 347.64]  That might be a different story.
[348.64 --> 354.64]  But it is very important that everyone brings their different gifts.
[356.04 --> 362.90]  These gifts that we serve with are not necessarily seen or always acknowledged.
[362.90 --> 365.86]  And having grown up in the church,
[365.96 --> 370.68]  I've always noted in my mind that for a healthy church to run,
[370.98 --> 374.36]  especially the major ministries, the big ministries to run smoothly,
[374.74 --> 378.88]  it takes a lot of people who work and serve in the background.
[379.56 --> 382.82]  And they're not necessarily always acknowledged or thanked.
[384.10 --> 386.00]  And so a couple of weeks ago,
[386.10 --> 389.88]  when we did the Volunteer Appreciation Sunday,
[389.88 --> 393.92]  it wasn't just something that the leaders of the church thought of
[393.92 --> 395.44]  to get done and away with,
[396.02 --> 397.14]  so that they can say,
[397.28 --> 399.08]  there, now we've thanked you,
[399.40 --> 400.88]  you've been paid, now go serve.
[402.22 --> 403.90]  Although it was far from perfect,
[404.30 --> 407.48]  it was a beautiful reflection of our passage this morning,
[407.68 --> 408.84]  which we actually didn't read,
[408.92 --> 411.58]  but I will read for us now.
[412.94 --> 414.64]  Starting on verse 22, it says,
[414.64 --> 415.86]  On the contrary,
[416.50 --> 420.14]  those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable.
[421.40 --> 423.70]  And the parts that we think are less honorable,
[424.26 --> 425.78]  we treat with special honor.
[426.44 --> 430.68]  And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty.
[433.62 --> 436.96]  And so Paul, in many places of his letters,
[437.58 --> 440.84]  uses the analogy of the church being Christ's body.
[440.84 --> 446.92]  And we are his body because we reflect his likeness.
[448.24 --> 451.20]  Our God is wonderfully diverse,
[451.54 --> 453.24]  and he's wonderfully creative.
[454.70 --> 459.02]  God is distinctly Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[462.60 --> 464.24]  Yes, he is.
[464.48 --> 467.12]  But he is truly one,
[467.12 --> 470.32]  and he represents that perfect unity.
[470.84 --> 473.96]  And we try to reflect that as his body,
[474.96 --> 477.84]  where we are clearly distinct.
[478.02 --> 479.48]  We are very different.
[479.92 --> 484.56]  And you can just see it on an outward appearance itself,
[484.88 --> 486.42]  as you look at the new members today.
[487.02 --> 490.96]  We are distinctly different and bring different gifts,
[491.62 --> 495.16]  but we reflect God's likeness by becoming one together.
[495.16 --> 500.88]  This brings me to the second point.
[500.96 --> 501.94]  I'm already at the second point.
[502.02 --> 502.82]  It's the last point.
[504.28 --> 506.32]  Unity among diversity
[506.32 --> 508.92]  also means, and I would add,
[509.44 --> 511.72]  that we bring diverse gifts
[511.72 --> 515.00]  and also bring diverse brokenness.
[515.50 --> 516.88]  And I want to highlight that
[516.88 --> 519.72]  the gifts that we bring are not just always all joyful.
[519.72 --> 522.70]  We are a gathering of sinful people.
[523.64 --> 526.26]  We bring and we come together
[526.26 --> 529.36]  as God's people with our brokenness.
[530.94 --> 532.90]  I have used this image before,
[533.06 --> 534.64]  and this was inspired by Pastor Sid
[534.64 --> 536.26]  from his sermon a while back.
[536.84 --> 538.32]  We are like a broken bowl
[538.32 --> 540.58]  put together by the grace of God.
[540.58 --> 543.20]  And so when God's Spirit fills us,
[543.58 --> 547.50]  we overflow so that we may be able to love and bless others.
[548.66 --> 551.04]  The point is that we are not perfect
[551.04 --> 552.62]  and that our church,
[552.72 --> 554.70]  or any church for that matter, is perfect.
[555.90 --> 560.28]  The point is that we trust in our God who is perfect.
[561.02 --> 562.50]  And when we put our trust in Him,
[563.10 --> 564.88]  He allows His church to grow
[564.88 --> 568.56]  and overflow with His love and mission for the world.
[568.56 --> 573.32]  And so this is God's mission that He accomplishes through us.
[574.24 --> 576.72]  That is why in verse 18 that we looked at today,
[577.14 --> 579.92]  it says God has placed the parts in the body,
[580.18 --> 581.38]  every one of them,
[581.76 --> 583.20]  just as He wanted them to be.
[584.44 --> 585.90]  And part of this loving mission
[585.90 --> 588.84]  is that we reflect this unity of our God
[588.84 --> 592.12]  where all the parts of the body here together
[592.12 --> 595.30]  share equal concern for one another.
[595.30 --> 598.82]  share equal concern for one another.
[599.72 --> 602.24]  And so what does this equal concern look like?
[603.48 --> 606.18]  Paul says in verse 26 of our text this morning,
[606.50 --> 608.12]  if one part suffers,
[608.76 --> 610.48]  every part suffers with it.
[611.16 --> 613.18]  If one part is honored,
[614.08 --> 615.94]  we all rejoice with it.
[615.94 --> 619.24]  Now there is no question,
[619.76 --> 621.08]  and I think everyone can agree,
[621.30 --> 624.54]  that we go through life with many sufferings and joys.
[625.70 --> 628.20]  What Paul encourages the church,
[628.44 --> 629.42]  the body of Christ,
[629.70 --> 630.96]  God's people to do,
[631.24 --> 633.40]  is to suffer and rejoice
[633.40 --> 636.68]  through our spiritual journeys of life together.
[636.68 --> 640.74]  It is such an obvious reality
[640.74 --> 642.10]  that there is no joy
[642.10 --> 645.44]  if one cannot celebrate and rejoice with someone.
[646.16 --> 648.84]  Imagine doing Misha's wedding yesterday
[648.84 --> 651.26]  and not inviting anyone to the wedding.
[652.84 --> 655.28]  Or giving birth to a newborn
[655.28 --> 658.96]  and not being able to share that news with anyone.
[658.96 --> 661.68]  Or on the other side,
[662.02 --> 663.48]  grieving a loss in the family
[663.48 --> 668.02]  with seemingly no one to share the memories and the grief with.
[670.36 --> 672.48]  So we come together in unity,
[672.86 --> 675.00]  which is not uniformity.
[676.36 --> 678.28]  It is so much wonderful
[678.28 --> 680.76]  and seemingly chaotic diversity
[680.76 --> 683.30]  coming together to try and reflect
[683.30 --> 685.62]  God's example of perfect unity.
[685.62 --> 688.52]  And in order for this to happen,
[689.10 --> 690.58]  everyone needs to
[690.58 --> 692.02]  either find
[692.02 --> 693.94]  and or acknowledge
[693.94 --> 696.00]  their unique giftedness
[696.00 --> 697.80]  and brokenness
[697.80 --> 699.28]  in our humility
[699.28 --> 701.62]  as we gather together as the church.
[703.02 --> 704.66]  And so this is the encouragement
[704.66 --> 706.50]  for us this morning, Hope.
[706.96 --> 708.70]  Especially for the new members.
[710.72 --> 711.80]  May we reflect
[711.80 --> 714.16]  the loving unity of our God,
[714.16 --> 717.02]  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
[717.02 --> 719.10]  with all of our diverse gifts.
[720.10 --> 721.60]  And may God's Holy Spirit
[721.60 --> 722.60]  guide us
[722.60 --> 724.26]  as we come together in unity
[724.26 --> 726.30]  with all of our brokenness as well.
[727.46 --> 728.28]  In this way,
[728.68 --> 730.66]  we all suffer and rejoice
[730.66 --> 732.50]  together as God's people.
[733.88 --> 734.58]  And we say,
[734.78 --> 735.74]  and we confess,
[735.84 --> 736.88]  and we profess together
[736.88 --> 737.96]  with the psalmist
[737.96 --> 738.92]  as he says,
[738.92 --> 741.50]  how good and pleasant it is
[741.50 --> 742.88]  when God's people
[742.88 --> 744.58]  live together in unity.
[745.34 --> 745.62]  Amen?
[746.48 --> 747.08]  Amen.
[747.44 --> 748.32]  Let us pray together.
[754.08 --> 755.14]  And this morning,
[755.26 --> 756.36]  I would like to share a prayer
[756.36 --> 758.02]  that is based off of
[758.02 --> 759.12]  the Belgic Confessions,
[759.60 --> 761.86]  which reflect this unity.
[761.86 --> 764.60]  So we pray,
[764.80 --> 766.00]  Creator of color,
[767.20 --> 768.30]  Lord of variety,
[769.60 --> 770.58]  forgive our attempts
[770.58 --> 771.60]  to make your church
[771.60 --> 773.14]  fit a bland oneness.
[774.78 --> 776.28]  Differences frighten us,
[776.72 --> 779.00]  so we instinctively downplay them,
[779.52 --> 780.62]  which only reveals
[780.62 --> 782.02]  our ignorance of the gospel
[782.02 --> 782.50]  and you.
[782.50 --> 784.46]  Thank you,
[784.62 --> 785.50]  Triune God,
[785.66 --> 787.02]  for showing in yourself
[787.02 --> 789.20]  something so refreshingly different,
[789.20 --> 792.22]  a unity that is not uniformity,
[792.76 --> 794.36]  but a refreshing diversity
[794.36 --> 795.66]  of one God
[795.66 --> 796.80]  and three persons.
[797.52 --> 797.84]  Amen.
[799.44 --> 800.98]  I invite you to stand
[800.98 --> 802.48]  as we sing our song of response.
