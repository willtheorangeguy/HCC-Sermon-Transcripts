[0.00 → 8.74] Well, if you've been travelling with us
[8.74 → 10.42] in these past few Sundays,
[10.50 → 11.26] you'll know that we're preaching
[11.26 → 12.36] our way through the Psalms.
[13.08 → 14.10] And our series is called
[14.10 → 16.00] Honest to God, Praying the Psalms.
[16.20 → 17.90] And it has been a privilege for us
[17.90 → 19.36] as pastors just to be working
[19.36 → 20.14] our way through these,
[20.26 → 21.78] recognizing that these Psalms
[21.78 → 23.02] have been sung and memorized
[23.02 → 25.08] and prayed by generations of believers.
[25.24 → 26.14] In fact, someone told me
[26.14 → 27.14] just the other day
[27.14 → 28.34] that they learned most of the Psalms
[28.34 → 29.12] through singing them.
[29.12 → 30.96] And it's a privilege for us
[30.96 → 32.40] this morning to read Psalm 8
[32.40 → 34.46] and hear God speak to us through it.
[34.48 → 35.80] So if you have your Bible on your phone
[35.80 → 37.78] or you have it in the physical Bible,
[38.30 → 39.00] join me.
[39.10 → 40.30] It's also going to be on the screen.
[41.50 → 42.64] This is Psalm 8.
[46.84 → 48.22] Lord, our Lord,
[48.32 → 50.24] how majestic is your name
[50.24 → 51.10] in all the earth.
[51.92 → 54.30] You have set your glory above the heavens
[54.30 → 56.44] through the praise of children
[56.44 → 57.32] and infants.
[57.32 → 59.44] You have established a stronghold
[59.44 → 60.44] against your enemies
[60.44 → 62.78] to silence the foe and the avenger.
[63.88 → 65.22] When I consider your heavens,
[65.96 → 67.54] the works of your fingers,
[68.02 → 69.08] the moon and the stars
[69.08 → 70.62] which you have set in place,
[71.18 → 72.78] what are humankind
[72.78 → 75.02] that you are mindful of them?
[75.94 → 78.08] Human beings that you care for them.
[79.02 → 80.52] You've made them a little lower
[80.52 → 81.62] than the heavenly beings
[81.62 → 83.56] and crowned them with glory and honour.
[83.56 → 85.14] You made them rulers
[85.14 → 86.88] over the works of your hands.
[87.44 → 89.56] You put everything under their feet.
[90.22 → 91.32] All flocks and herds,
[91.62 → 92.64] the animals of the wild,
[92.74 → 93.70] the birds of the sky,
[93.82 → 94.72] the fish of the sea,
[94.84 → 97.02] all that swim in the paths of the seas.
[97.68 → 99.14] Lord, our Lord,
[99.54 → 101.88] how majestic is your name
[101.88 → 103.26] in all the earth.
[103.26 → 113.02] On February 14, 1990,
[114.02 → 115.18] when I was five years old,
[115.46 → 117.54] there was a famous photograph
[117.54 → 118.74] taken from space.
[119.22 → 120.46] Some of you might remember this.
[121.18 → 122.26] It was a photograph taken
[122.26 → 123.82] by Voyager 1 spacecraft,
[124.74 → 126.64] and that spacecraft had gone further
[126.64 → 127.90] than any other spacecraft
[127.90 → 130.10] had ever gone away from the earth.
[130.10 → 130.92] It was approximately
[130.92 → 133.52] six billion kilometres away from earth,
[133.60 → 134.44] and it took a photo
[134.44 → 137.40] that took five months to download.
[138.56 → 139.52] This is the photo.
[141.70 → 142.36] Ta-da.
[144.12 → 145.58] Now, we should play I Spy.
[145.88 → 146.46] I want to make sure
[146.46 → 148.44] we can all see where earth is.
[149.88 → 154.42] It is that tiny speck of blue
[154.42 → 156.06] in that blue streak.
[157.38 → 158.20] Now, when this photo
[158.20 → 159.48] was sort of released to the public,
[159.48 → 160.50] it generated a lot
[160.50 → 161.50] of interesting conversation
[161.50 → 162.38] among scientists
[162.38 → 163.54] and those who were involved
[163.54 → 164.78] in sort of space exploration.
[164.94 → 165.92] The conversation was,
[166.62 → 167.56] look at what we can do.
[167.70 → 168.90] Look how far we can travel.
[169.04 → 170.14] Look what new opportunities
[170.14 → 171.80] of exploration are before us.
[172.00 → 173.34] But for the rest of us,
[173.48 → 174.46] looking at this photo,
[175.06 → 176.58] many people couldn't help
[176.58 → 177.90] but stare at it and say,
[178.36 → 179.30] oh my goodness,
[179.80 → 182.12] we are so small.
[183.44 → 185.14] And there have been many people
[185.14 → 186.64] of many different backgrounds
[186.64 → 187.90] who look at this and say,
[187.90 → 190.44] what value and meaning
[190.44 → 192.78] does my tiny little life
[192.78 → 195.10] on that tiny little speck
[195.10 → 197.56] have when I see this photo?
[198.52 → 199.62] It's a sobering picture
[199.62 → 200.60] in many ways.
[201.52 → 202.50] What's it all worth?
[202.60 → 203.42] What's it all for?
[203.64 → 204.40] What's the meaning
[204.40 → 205.96] of our tiny short lives
[205.96 → 207.46] on that little speck
[207.46 → 208.60] we call earth?
[208.60 → 212.96] When David wrote Psalm 8,
[213.52 → 214.72] generations ago,
[214.80 → 215.86] he couldn't even fathom
[215.86 → 217.28] a picture like this.
[217.64 → 218.40] He couldn't even imagine
[218.40 → 219.34] a spacecraft taking
[219.34 → 220.14] a photo of earth.
[220.22 → 221.42] In fact, my hunch,
[221.58 → 222.28] just my hunch,
[222.70 → 223.92] is that David wrote this
[223.92 → 224.80] doing something
[224.80 → 225.60] that many of us love
[225.60 → 226.42] doing at camp.
[227.78 → 228.18] Stargazing.
[228.62 → 229.76] Who loves stargazing here?
[230.50 → 231.58] Oh, there's a few of us.
[231.84 → 233.20] Did anyone go for the supermoon
[233.20 → 233.78] on Wednesday?
[234.74 → 235.66] Yes, there's a few of us
[235.66 → 235.94] who did.
[236.02 → 236.18] Okay.
[236.34 → 237.02] My wife chased it
[237.02 → 237.58] and couldn't find it.
[238.24 → 238.90] Wasn't big enough.
[240.24 → 241.38] David wrote this Psalm
[241.38 → 243.00] while looking up in the sky,
[243.84 → 245.18] probably just reflecting
[245.18 → 245.72] on the beauty,
[245.82 → 246.20] the power,
[246.26 → 247.30] and the character of God.
[247.60 → 248.56] And what's so interesting
[248.56 → 249.80] about him is that
[249.80 → 251.04] as he looked at the bigness
[251.04 → 252.14] of what's up there,
[252.20 → 252.98] it didn't make him
[252.98 → 254.44] just feel the smallness
[254.44 → 255.14] of our lives,
[255.16 → 256.40] but it made him struck
[256.40 → 258.34] by the God who places
[258.34 → 259.30] the stars and the moon
[259.30 → 259.80] up there,
[260.40 → 261.88] cares for our small lives
[261.88 → 262.52] down here.
[263.70 → 265.18] The one who sets
[265.18 → 266.64] the heavens above us
[266.64 → 268.26] that we get to marvel at
[268.26 → 269.10] as we camp
[269.10 → 270.10] is also the one
[270.10 → 271.32] who concerns himself
[271.32 → 273.28] with our seemingly
[273.28 → 275.82] insignificant short lives.
[276.80 → 277.60] And David writes
[277.60 → 279.10] a psalm of praise
[279.10 → 280.02] about it.
[280.12 → 280.38] In fact,
[280.66 → 281.24] this psalm
[281.24 → 281.82] has been dubbed
[281.82 → 282.46] by some people
[282.46 → 283.32] as the psalm
[283.32 → 284.94] that celebrates humanity.
[285.46 → 286.12] He looks up
[286.12 → 286.82] and he looks down
[286.82 → 287.22] and he says,
[287.34 → 287.74] God,
[288.26 → 289.72] you care for us.
[290.02 → 291.04] All this is yours
[291.04 → 292.18] and yet you concern
[292.18 → 294.28] yourself with our tiny
[294.28 → 295.80] little life down here.
[296.52 → 297.48] That's psalm A.
[297.74 → 298.88] That's a very good sneeze.
[300.54 → 301.64] Now the psalm begins
[301.64 → 302.22] with that phrase,
[302.34 → 303.00] Lord, our Lord,
[303.06 → 304.66] how majestic is your name
[304.66 → 305.64] in all the earth.
[305.68 → 306.34] And when he says
[306.34 → 306.92] your name,
[306.98 → 307.38] he's talking about
[307.38 → 308.84] how majestic is your character.
[309.40 → 310.82] Dave looks at the skies.
[310.94 → 311.54] He sees the moon.
[311.60 → 312.26] He sees the stars.
[312.34 → 312.58] He says,
[312.80 → 314.60] that's God's character.
[314.88 → 316.38] That's God's handiwork.
[316.80 → 317.76] And I hope some of us
[317.76 → 318.60] have had that experience
[318.60 → 319.36] already this summer
[319.36 → 320.06] while travelling
[320.06 → 320.90] or vacationing
[320.90 → 321.36] or camping
[321.36 → 322.94] to see the handiwork of God
[322.94 → 323.26] and say,
[323.40 → 323.64] wow,
[324.20 → 325.12] that's his work.
[325.44 → 326.20] Whether you're touching
[326.20 → 327.86] the 100-year-old Douglas Fir,
[327.98 → 328.60] whether you're standing
[328.60 → 329.42] on Crescent Beach
[329.42 → 330.62] or whether you're looking up
[330.62 → 331.42] at the supermoon
[331.42 → 332.42] as we did
[332.42 → 333.58] at the Vincula Farm
[333.58 → 334.58] this Tuesday,
[335.38 → 336.52] we look up and say,
[336.66 → 336.96] Lord,
[337.60 → 338.64] that's your work.
[339.44 → 341.12] How majestic is your character,
[341.90 → 342.40] your name.
[343.54 → 344.50] But the psalm goes
[344.50 → 345.86] from big to little.
[345.96 → 346.68] It goes from sort of
[346.68 → 347.96] the macro of the sky
[347.96 → 348.90] to the smallest
[348.90 → 349.58] and that is
[349.58 → 350.86] the praise of babies.
[351.44 → 352.26] Did you notice a shift
[352.26 → 352.82] in verse 2?
[353.36 → 354.60] This is what David says next.
[354.68 → 354.92] He says,
[355.12 → 355.94] through the praise
[355.94 → 357.36] of children and infants,
[357.90 → 358.78] you have established
[358.78 → 359.58] a stronghold
[359.58 → 360.48] against your enemies
[360.48 → 361.88] to silence the foe
[361.88 → 362.46] and the avenger.
[363.32 → 363.96] In a psalm
[363.96 → 364.54] that celebrates
[364.54 → 365.22] human dignity,
[365.36 → 366.34] the first people
[366.34 → 367.32] that David mentions
[367.32 → 368.84] are babies and children.
[368.96 → 369.36] How fitting.
[370.66 → 371.86] But I want to tell you
[371.86 → 372.76] that there's so many people
[372.76 → 373.56] who look at this verse
[373.56 → 375.08] and we have no idea
[375.08 → 375.74] what it means.
[376.06 → 376.58] Maybe you're wondering
[376.58 → 377.54] that what does it mean
[377.54 → 378.62] that through the praise
[378.62 → 379.66] of children and infants,
[380.02 → 381.04] the Lord establishes
[381.04 → 381.70] a stronghold
[381.70 → 382.54] against enemies
[382.54 → 383.86] to silence the foe
[383.86 → 384.44] and the avenger.
[385.32 → 385.94] And I want to just
[385.94 → 386.60] be up front with you
[386.60 → 387.20] and say there's about
[387.20 → 387.86] like four different
[387.86 → 388.50] takes on it
[388.50 → 389.58] and I'm not even sure
[389.58 → 390.02] which is right
[390.02 → 390.54] but I'm going to give you
[390.54 → 391.48] the one I like the most.
[391.60 → 392.26] If you don't like it,
[392.34 → 393.22] you go to the commentaries,
[393.32 → 393.86] you come back.
[394.42 → 395.14] I think the pastor
[395.14 → 395.92] and Sandra's son
[395.92 → 396.44] will probably have
[396.44 → 396.92] some conversation
[396.92 → 397.72] with me afterwards
[397.72 → 398.30] about that.
[399.86 → 400.78] My take is that
[400.78 → 401.56] it's a way of saying,
[401.64 → 401.98] God,
[402.40 → 403.50] you work through the weak,
[403.60 → 403.98] the vulnerable,
[404.08 → 404.62] and the powerless
[404.62 → 406.32] to accomplish your purposes.
[407.28 → 408.40] As the weakest people,
[408.50 → 409.40] as the smallest people,
[409.46 → 410.82] as the most insignificant people
[410.82 → 411.84] call on your name,
[411.92 → 413.06] they praise your name,
[413.26 → 414.02] you equip them
[414.02 → 414.88] to stand against
[414.88 → 415.78] the work of the enemy.
[417.04 → 418.52] Take that in for a minute.
[419.16 → 420.26] That the God of the universe
[420.26 → 421.46] who sets it all in place
[421.46 → 422.64] has in his love
[422.64 → 423.54] and mercy and goodness
[423.54 → 423.76] says,
[423.90 → 424.44] I'll work through
[424.44 → 425.18] the weak people.
[425.66 → 426.30] I'll work through
[426.30 → 427.10] the insignificant ones.
[427.18 → 427.68] I'll work through
[427.68 → 428.90] the children and the infants.
[429.04 → 429.92] Thank you very much.
[429.96 → 430.54] I'm God.
[431.66 → 432.24] And I could say
[432.24 → 433.10] a lot more about this
[433.10 → 434.04] but I'm aware of the time.
[434.12 → 434.66] I just want to say
[434.66 → 435.48] as parents,
[436.24 → 437.20] that can reframe
[437.20 → 437.82] the way we think
[437.82 → 438.40] about our children.
[439.28 → 440.32] That casts a new vision
[440.32 → 441.46] for what God might seek
[441.46 → 442.32] to do through
[442.32 → 443.86] our children and our infants
[443.86 → 444.82] as they call on
[444.82 → 445.60] and praise the name
[445.60 → 446.04] of the Father.
[446.34 → 447.80] What might he seek to do
[447.80 → 448.84] through the little ones,
[449.24 → 449.92] through the vulnerable?
[450.68 → 451.18] And if you look
[451.18 → 451.96] at the biblical story
[451.96 → 452.58] through the beginning
[452.58 → 453.38] right to the end,
[453.48 → 454.40] God always chooses
[454.40 → 455.20] the unlikeliest,
[455.64 → 456.38] the small ones.
[456.46 → 456.72] In fact,
[456.78 → 457.70] some of his best work
[457.70 → 458.04] in history
[458.04 → 458.66] is through what?
[459.62 → 460.02] Babies.
[461.22 → 461.94] That's God.
[463.10 → 464.24] Then we get to
[464.24 → 464.64] what I think
[464.64 → 465.92] is the most central question
[465.92 → 466.96] in this whole psalm
[466.96 → 467.90] and that is verse 4
[467.90 → 468.46] where David,
[468.56 → 469.64] who's looking up probably,
[470.22 → 470.52] he says,
[470.66 → 471.88] when I consider the heavens,
[472.66 → 473.88] what is mankind
[473.88 → 476.04] that you're mindful of them?
[476.66 → 478.10] What are human beings
[478.10 → 480.08] that you care for them?
[481.26 → 482.06] And it is true
[482.06 → 482.74] that because of
[482.74 → 483.94] scientific exploration
[483.94 → 484.80] and the universe
[484.80 → 485.28] sort of having
[485.28 → 486.04] so many photos
[486.04 → 486.66] and we see pictures
[486.66 → 487.16] of galaxies,
[487.52 → 488.38] many people have said
[488.38 → 490.38] there is no real value
[490.38 → 491.38] to human life.
[491.38 → 493.30] At least they would say
[493.30 → 494.84] it's very insignificant
[494.84 → 496.12] in the cosmic scheme
[496.12 → 496.86] of things, right?
[497.28 → 498.48] We are just little humans
[498.48 → 499.54] living in one corner
[499.54 → 500.54] of this blue dot
[500.54 → 501.28] that is the earth
[501.28 → 502.92] and we get 80 years,
[503.14 → 504.60] 90 at best.
[506.00 → 507.16] And one of my favourite writers,
[507.26 → 507.96] Leslie New begin,
[508.06 → 508.36] said,
[508.74 → 509.76] I'm aware that my life
[509.76 → 510.24] is short
[510.24 → 511.16] and I know that
[511.16 → 511.90] after I die,
[512.00 → 512.80] my life will be,
[512.88 → 513.16] quote,
[513.50 → 514.72] buried by the rubble
[514.72 → 515.36] of history.
[515.86 → 516.70] And that's sobering,
[516.78 → 517.50] but it's true.
[518.22 → 519.34] We are quickly aging,
[519.56 → 520.38] we are quickly replaced
[520.38 → 521.36] by future generations,
[521.46 → 522.06] you saw some of them
[522.06 → 522.56] on the stage
[522.56 → 523.58] and life is short
[523.58 → 524.02] and we ask,
[524.18 → 525.06] what's the meaning of it?
[525.68 → 526.32] What's the value
[526.32 → 528.16] of my short little life
[528.16 → 529.12] here on earth?
[529.90 → 530.96] But what's so striking
[530.96 → 531.98] about David's statement
[531.98 → 534.10] is it's a rhetorical question.
[534.78 → 535.96] He's not actually asking it
[535.96 → 536.90] with a sense of despair
[536.90 → 537.46] or worry,
[537.52 → 538.06] he's asking it
[538.06 → 538.62] with a sense of,
[539.14 → 540.26] I know through the eyes
[540.26 → 540.78] of faith.
[541.14 → 541.96] Because listen to how
[541.96 → 542.48] he answers.
[543.28 → 544.58] He says in the next few verses,
[545.00 → 545.80] you, God,
[545.94 → 547.00] have made humans
[547.00 → 547.76] a little lower
[547.76 → 548.42] than the angels.
[549.22 → 549.86] Let's take that in
[549.86 → 550.18] for a minute.
[550.38 → 551.28] A little lower
[551.28 → 551.90] than the angels
[551.90 → 552.70] and crown them
[552.70 → 554.02] with glory and honour.
[554.40 → 555.28] You made them rulers
[555.28 → 555.96] over the works
[555.96 → 556.68] of your hands.
[556.98 → 558.70] You put everything
[558.70 → 560.16] under their feet.
[561.36 → 562.48] Is that how you view
[562.48 → 563.42] what it means to be human?
[564.62 → 566.00] That's a big picture,
[566.70 → 567.74] a big statement
[567.74 → 568.52] about what it means
[568.52 → 569.16] to be humans.
[570.04 → 570.88] And what David's noting
[570.88 → 571.80] is in spite of all
[571.80 → 572.34] the hugeness
[572.34 → 573.22] of the world around us,
[573.26 → 574.04] in spite of its beauty,
[574.16 → 574.80] its vastness,
[574.86 → 575.22] he says,
[575.22 → 576.10] God,
[576.20 → 577.46] you've given us
[577.46 → 579.18] this privileged place
[579.18 → 580.56] in this world.
[581.10 → 581.88] You've crowned us
[581.88 → 582.66] with glory and honour.
[582.86 → 584.06] Everything's under our feet.
[584.30 → 585.26] And what he's pointing to,
[585.36 → 586.20] and a lot of commentators
[586.20 → 586.80] note this,
[587.08 → 588.04] is Genesis 1
[588.04 → 589.78] is feeding into Psalm 8.
[590.52 → 591.48] David knows the story
[591.48 → 592.10] of Genesis 1
[592.10 → 593.06] and what he's aware of,
[593.10 → 594.24] as we should also be,
[594.60 → 596.24] is that the climactic event
[596.24 → 597.12] of Genesis 1
[597.12 → 598.82] is God creating the world,
[598.92 → 599.44] but the climax
[599.44 → 600.28] wasn't the creation
[600.28 → 601.02] of aquatic life,
[601.08 → 601.88] it wasn't plant life,
[601.88 → 602.76] it wasn't animal life,
[602.80 → 604.70] it was humans.
[605.66 → 606.82] Male and female
[606.82 → 609.22] created in God's image.
[609.78 → 610.72] That is said about
[610.72 → 612.40] nothing else in creation.
[612.88 → 613.68] These people,
[614.12 → 615.16] formed and fashioned
[615.16 → 616.62] by the God of creation,
[617.10 → 618.44] they are the only ones
[618.44 → 619.36] about whom it is said,
[619.48 → 621.42] you are made in my image.
[622.92 → 623.50] And there's a lot
[623.50 → 624.04] that I could say
[624.04 → 624.90] about being created
[624.90 → 625.94] in the image of God,
[626.30 → 627.48] but it certainly reflects
[627.48 → 628.56] nothing less than
[628.56 → 631.12] reflecting his beauty,
[631.12 → 633.14] reflecting his power,
[633.32 → 634.82] reflecting his goodness,
[635.56 → 637.20] reflecting his love,
[637.38 → 638.98] imaging his creativity,
[639.40 → 640.34] and his thinking,
[640.46 → 640.96] his power,
[641.06 → 641.32] his strength,
[641.40 → 642.02] all those things
[642.02 → 643.32] is built into being
[643.32 → 644.28] image bearers.
[645.06 → 645.94] That's quite something
[645.94 → 646.48] to think about.
[647.48 → 648.72] And, even more striking,
[648.84 → 649.82] if you read an Egyptian
[649.82 → 651.02] creation account,
[651.10 → 651.66] because there are many
[651.66 → 652.50] other creation accounts,
[652.56 → 653.54] Egyptian, Babylonian,
[653.68 → 654.54] they all have a very
[654.54 → 655.60] different take on humans
[655.60 → 656.22] in creation.
[656.86 → 657.96] Sometimes they are just
[657.96 → 659.14] there to feed the gods,
[659.24 → 660.22] other times they are
[660.22 → 661.08] just slaves whose
[661.08 → 662.04] lives are expendable.
[662.12 → 662.54] And then we get to
[662.54 → 663.16] Genesis 1,
[663.30 → 664.46] which feeds Psalm 8,
[664.70 → 665.40] and David's saying,
[665.52 → 667.54] Lord, you've placed us
[667.54 → 669.36] in charge of this creation.
[670.28 → 671.40] You put everything
[671.40 → 672.36] under our feet.
[672.76 → 674.14] And, I might add,
[674.56 → 676.10] he delighted to do so.
[677.28 → 679.28] He delighted to fashion
[679.28 → 680.46] human beings in his image.
[680.74 → 682.24] He marvels himself
[682.24 → 683.54] at little Georgia and Fay
[683.54 → 683.82] and says,
[684.20 → 686.16] that's my image bearer.
[686.76 → 688.04] And I delight in giving
[688.04 → 689.46] men and women rule
[689.46 → 690.42] over my good creation.
[690.54 → 691.84] I want them to enjoy it.
[691.88 → 693.14] I want them to cultivate it.
[693.14 → 694.42] I want them to develop it.
[694.62 → 695.44] The heart of God
[695.44 → 697.10] is pleased in the position
[697.10 → 698.96] that we get in creation.
[700.24 → 701.06] Isn't that a remarkable
[701.06 → 702.06] thing to think about?
[702.06 → 706.98] You know, many social movements
[706.98 → 707.62] in history
[707.62 → 709.56] that stand against injustice,
[710.02 → 710.86] that care for the weak
[710.86 → 711.38] and the vulnerable,
[711.72 → 712.76] are done by believers
[712.76 → 713.60] who take the Bible,
[713.70 → 714.78] they take Genesis 1,
[714.88 → 716.74] they take Psalm 8,
[716.80 → 717.96] they take Ephesians 2,
[718.02 → 718.98] which describes humans
[718.98 → 720.24] as God's handiwork,
[720.32 → 720.86] his masterpiece,
[721.06 → 721.30] and they say,
[721.52 → 722.26] if that's true,
[722.66 → 724.24] I must stand against injustice.
[724.68 → 725.44] If that's true,
[725.52 → 726.72] I must work towards
[726.72 → 727.56] caring for the widow
[727.56 → 728.12] and the orphan
[728.12 → 728.66] and the poor.
[728.66 → 730.50] I must support refugees
[730.50 → 731.26] fleeing from war
[731.26 → 732.98] because these are not
[732.98 → 734.28] just expendable things.
[734.66 → 735.74] These are image bearers
[735.74 → 737.30] and I must care.
[739.50 → 740.98] Now, there's a well-known writer
[740.98 → 741.82] named C.S. Lewis.
[742.02 → 742.84] I think most of us
[742.84 → 743.62] will know him at least
[743.62 → 744.08] from writing
[744.08 → 745.14] The Chronicles of Narnia,
[745.24 → 746.08] a wonderful series.
[747.06 → 747.64] He's also written
[747.64 → 748.32] a number of other works,
[748.44 → 749.28] one of which is called
[749.28 → 750.28] The Weight of Glory.
[750.90 → 751.84] And that's actually taken
[751.84 → 752.54] from Psalm 8
[752.54 → 753.18] where C.S. Lewis
[753.18 → 753.90] does some deep,
[754.30 → 755.46] very creative reflection
[755.46 → 756.04] on what it means
[756.04 → 756.66] to be humans,
[756.66 → 757.18] humans,
[757.84 → 758.28] what it means
[758.28 → 758.74] to be created
[758.74 → 759.28] in God's image,
[759.38 → 759.76] what it means
[759.76 → 760.68] to have a vision
[760.68 → 761.98] shaped by the Bible
[761.98 → 763.02] about what we are.
[763.32 → 764.40] And in my opinion,
[764.44 → 765.02] we don't think enough
[765.02 → 765.52] about this.
[766.20 → 767.06] And C.S. Lewis talks
[767.06 → 768.12] about how we are created
[768.12 → 769.10] and crowned with glory
[769.10 → 770.40] and how when Jesus comes back,
[770.48 → 771.70] we will be recreated
[771.70 → 772.64] and crowned with glory.
[772.72 → 773.26] And he does some
[773.26 → 774.26] fascinating reflection
[774.26 → 775.50] on the beauty
[775.50 → 776.50] of what we are created for
[776.50 → 777.86] and what we will have
[777.86 → 778.70] when Jesus returns.
[778.92 → 780.00] But this is what he says
[780.00 → 781.98] about being humans.
[783.20 → 783.66] He writes,
[783.66 → 786.18] You have never talked
[786.18 → 787.50] to a mere mortal.
[789.02 → 789.42] Remember,
[789.58 → 790.10] and I love this,
[790.22 → 791.50] remember that the dullest
[791.50 → 792.86] and most interesting person,
[793.28 → 794.34] are you imagining them right now?
[794.66 → 795.24] The dullest
[795.24 → 796.28] and most interesting person
[796.28 → 797.04] you talk to
[797.04 → 798.52] may one day be a creature
[798.52 → 800.58] which if you saw now,
[801.06 → 802.60] you would be strongly tempted
[802.60 → 803.32] to worship.
[804.82 → 807.20] Next to the blessed sacrament itself,
[807.92 → 808.96] your neighbour
[808.96 → 811.44] is the holiest object
[811.44 → 812.68] presented to your senses.
[813.66 → 815.02] Isn't that beautiful?
[815.82 → 817.26] And that's just C.S. Lewis saying,
[817.40 → 818.58] I'm reading Genesis 1.
[818.92 → 820.36] I'm reading Psalm 8.
[820.44 → 821.90] I'm reading what the Bible says
[821.90 → 822.42] in the New Testament
[822.42 → 822.96] about what it means
[822.96 → 823.88] to be children of God
[823.88 → 825.08] and this is true.
[826.10 → 827.30] You have never met
[827.30 → 828.40] a mere mortal.
[829.22 → 830.40] Even your greatest enemy
[830.40 → 832.20] is an image bearer
[832.20 → 833.70] created by the Father.
[835.50 → 837.12] Celebrating the glory of God
[837.12 → 838.58] and praising Him
[838.58 → 839.90] for the privileged position
[839.90 → 841.30] we have as bearers
[841.30 → 842.20] of His image and creation,
[842.34 → 843.14] that's Psalm 8.
[843.66 → 844.54] Your glory,
[844.72 → 845.22] Your majesty,
[845.34 → 845.80] Your goodness,
[846.18 → 846.90] I marvel
[846.90 → 848.70] at we as humans
[848.70 → 849.98] receive Your care.
[850.62 → 851.86] We receive Your mercy.
[851.98 → 853.34] We receive Your concern
[853.34 → 854.08] in our small,
[854.24 → 855.08] short little lives
[855.08 → 856.14] on planet Earth.
[858.08 → 859.16] What I want to do now
[859.16 → 860.52] is spend just a few minutes
[860.52 → 861.58] reflecting on
[861.58 → 863.62] how does this passage
[863.62 → 865.30] speak to us today?
[865.30 → 867.00] I mean, David wrote this psalm,
[867.08 → 867.62] this prayer,
[867.92 → 869.06] generations ago
[869.06 → 870.12] and here we are listening
[870.12 → 870.92] in Clayton Heights,
[871.02 → 871.92] Surrey, British Columbia
[871.92 → 873.38] in the 21st century.
[873.74 → 874.86] What is it that the Spirit
[874.86 → 876.96] has to say to the church today?
[878.32 → 879.42] Here are just a few
[879.42 → 880.46] of my own reflections.
[881.48 → 882.80] I think the first thing,
[882.90 → 883.58] at least for me,
[883.96 → 885.24] that this passage challenges
[885.24 → 886.96] is all the ways
[886.96 → 887.70] we reduce
[887.70 → 888.74] what it means to be human.
[889.74 → 890.36] And trust me,
[890.42 → 891.44] in our cultural moment,
[891.56 → 892.42] there are many ways
[892.42 → 893.66] that there are voices
[893.66 → 894.60] and institutions
[894.60 → 895.48] and people
[895.48 → 896.38] that will say
[896.38 → 897.10] human beings
[897.10 → 898.54] are much less
[898.54 → 899.94] than image bearers
[899.94 → 900.96] creating God's image.
[901.96 → 902.88] One of those
[902.88 → 903.92] is what I would call
[903.92 → 904.76] the materialist.
[904.80 → 905.28] And I'm not talking
[905.28 → 905.72] about shopping,
[905.80 → 906.16] I'm talking about
[906.16 → 907.08] the materialist worldview
[907.08 → 908.32] that says we are nothing more
[908.32 → 909.42] than matter in motion.
[909.94 → 910.66] Our bodies are just
[910.66 → 912.18] a collection of random molecules
[912.18 → 913.92] that live these short lives
[913.92 → 914.62] and then when we die,
[914.70 → 915.88] our bodies rot in the ground.
[916.20 → 916.68] That's it.
[917.54 → 918.94] That is a powerful worldview
[918.94 → 919.52] that came,
[919.64 → 919.96] in fact,
[920.24 → 921.80] alongside a lot of exploration,
[922.10 → 923.62] a lot of scientific experiment,
[923.74 → 924.12] the sense of
[924.12 → 926.10] we are just matter in motion.
[926.72 → 927.22] And of course,
[927.32 → 927.94] we are molecules,
[928.08 → 928.94] we are matter in motion,
[929.12 → 929.98] but we are created
[929.98 → 930.92] as image bearers
[930.92 → 932.58] with hearts and souls
[932.58 → 933.62] and minds and bodies
[933.62 → 935.46] that respond to a living God.
[936.20 → 937.30] And I've been part of
[937.30 → 938.90] and led a number of funerals
[938.90 → 939.86] and what I found is
[939.86 → 941.38] no matter what kind of people
[941.38 → 942.18] come to a funeral,
[942.50 → 943.62] when we see a body
[943.62 → 944.46] that is dead,
[944.46 → 946.28] we ache
[946.28 → 948.30] for there to be more
[948.30 → 949.02] than the grave.
[949.78 → 950.74] You know what I'm talking about.
[950.88 → 951.16] In fact,
[951.62 → 952.84] online watching right now
[952.84 → 953.96] is a number of family members
[953.96 → 954.76] of Brittany's family
[954.76 → 956.76] who are gathering next weekend
[956.76 → 958.50] to remember
[958.50 → 959.92] our great-granddad
[959.92 → 960.46] who died
[960.46 → 962.84] and to grieve his death.
[963.30 → 963.92] And that funeral,
[964.06 → 964.38] I know,
[964.46 → 965.26] is going to both
[965.26 → 966.46] celebrate his life,
[966.52 → 967.16] it will grieve
[967.16 → 968.44] the awful reality of death,
[968.56 → 969.24] but it will say,
[969.38 → 969.70] Jesus,
[970.34 → 971.12] the God of life,
[971.12 → 971.72] has taken
[971.72 → 973.14] great-granddad Green
[973.14 → 973.96] into his presence
[973.96 → 975.46] and great-granddad Green
[975.46 → 976.42] will get a new body
[976.42 → 977.84] in the new earth
[977.84 → 979.04] to live in forever
[979.04 → 980.54] because God has defeated
[980.54 → 981.10] the grave.
[982.40 → 984.04] We reduce our humanity
[984.04 → 984.58] when we say
[984.58 → 985.80] we are just molecules
[985.80 → 986.58] in motion.
[987.44 → 987.98] Another way
[987.98 → 989.24] that we reduce our humanity
[989.24 → 990.18] that Psalm 8 challenges
[990.18 → 991.72] is the consumer myth
[991.72 → 992.62] that we are all,
[992.74 → 993.94] all our lives matter
[993.94 → 994.86] because we shop
[994.86 → 995.82] and buy and acquire.
[996.38 → 997.18] And this is a lie
[997.18 → 998.08] that you will find
[998.08 → 998.58] on Netflix,
[999.48 → 999.98] you will find it
[999.98 → 1000.64] on Amazon Prime,
[1000.64 → 1001.14] you will find it
[1001.14 → 1001.76] on the commercials
[1001.76 → 1002.52] while you watch
[1002.52 → 1003.20] the hockey game.
[1004.60 → 1005.88] It's a powerful lie.
[1006.28 → 1006.94] It basically says
[1006.94 → 1007.98] the value of your life
[1007.98 → 1009.24] is the bigness of your home,
[1009.44 → 1010.28] the things you fill it with,
[1010.34 → 1011.28] the places you travel,
[1011.40 → 1012.30] all that you acquire,
[1012.58 → 1013.94] the person with the most
[1013.94 → 1015.46] and the most stamps
[1015.46 → 1016.30] on their passports
[1016.30 → 1016.98] at the end of life,
[1017.06 → 1017.96] that's the good life.
[1018.28 → 1019.00] And Psalm 8 says
[1019.00 → 1019.58] you are created
[1019.58 → 1020.66] for far more than that.
[1021.64 → 1022.42] Don't let that lie
[1022.42 → 1023.86] reduce your sense
[1023.86 → 1024.38] of humanity.
[1025.86 → 1026.48] A third way
[1026.48 → 1027.58] we reduce our humanity,
[1027.78 → 1028.86] and this is a powerful one
[1028.86 → 1029.78] as well in our culture,
[1029.78 → 1031.14] is we reduce ourselves
[1031.14 → 1032.36] just to our sexuality.
[1033.54 → 1034.92] We are the sum
[1034.92 → 1036.26] of our sexual experiences
[1036.26 → 1037.12] and what we crave,
[1037.20 → 1037.98] and the goal of life
[1037.98 → 1039.04] is to express ourselves
[1039.04 → 1040.08] and to find pleasure
[1040.08 → 1041.94] in that experience of life,
[1042.16 → 1043.04] and that's the essence
[1043.04 → 1043.56] of it all.
[1044.28 → 1044.96] And don't get me wrong,
[1045.06 → 1045.76] sex is a good gift
[1045.76 → 1046.26] of creation.
[1046.58 → 1047.04] It produces some
[1047.04 → 1047.84] pretty beautiful babies.
[1049.70 → 1050.46] Just this week,
[1050.64 → 1052.72] I had a song pop in my head,
[1052.76 → 1053.58] a song I'm not proud of
[1053.58 → 1054.54] knowing from my youth,
[1054.96 → 1055.74] and I thought I'd be able
[1055.74 → 1056.14] to quote it,
[1056.18 → 1056.72] but I don't think
[1056.72 → 1057.64] I'm going to get to it,
[1057.70 → 1058.74] but I'm going to read
[1058.74 → 1059.26] a part of it,
[1059.26 → 1059.72] and those of you
[1059.72 → 1060.10] who know it
[1060.10 → 1060.46] will know
[1060.46 → 1061.32] what I'm talking about.
[1062.46 → 1063.38] It's from my youth,
[1063.48 → 1064.80] and the chorus goes,
[1064.94 → 1065.88] you and me, baby,
[1065.96 → 1067.06] ain't nothing but mammals.
[1070.00 → 1071.16] The rest of you know that,
[1071.20 → 1071.66] and I'm not even
[1071.66 → 1072.30] going to finish it.
[1073.94 → 1074.92] That is a reduction
[1074.92 → 1075.52] of humanity,
[1075.68 → 1076.26] and we laugh,
[1076.34 → 1077.48] but that is a powerful
[1077.48 → 1078.42] reduction that says
[1078.42 → 1079.70] you're just your sexuality.
[1080.62 → 1081.32] And Psalm 8
[1081.32 → 1082.50] and the New Testament
[1082.50 → 1084.34] say you were created
[1084.34 → 1086.38] with glory and honour.
[1087.34 → 1088.58] The loving Father
[1088.58 → 1090.02] who formed and fashioned
[1090.02 → 1090.62] your body
[1090.62 → 1091.46] and your mother's womb,
[1091.76 → 1092.68] he stamped you
[1092.68 → 1093.42] in his image,
[1093.48 → 1094.42] and do not let
[1094.42 → 1095.40] any lie
[1095.40 → 1096.44] from the materialist worldview
[1096.44 → 1097.60] to the consumer myth
[1097.60 → 1098.80] to the sexuality
[1098.80 → 1099.48] being reduced
[1099.48 → 1100.88] who you really are.
[1101.54 → 1103.12] You belong to God.
[1103.80 → 1105.32] You are his creation,
[1105.56 → 1106.78] and as Philippians 2 says,
[1106.86 → 1108.56] you are his masterpiece,
[1109.16 → 1110.48] created for good works
[1110.48 → 1111.18] that he prepared
[1111.18 → 1111.68] in advance
[1111.68 → 1112.60] for you to do.
[1113.26 → 1114.12] I really do believe
[1114.12 → 1114.72] that Psalm 8
[1114.72 → 1116.50] shatters so many lies
[1116.50 → 1118.42] that reduce our humanity.
[1119.02 → 1120.02] That's my first reflection.
[1120.96 → 1121.76] A second reflection
[1121.76 → 1122.46] is a question
[1122.46 → 1123.68] that I couldn't help
[1123.68 → 1124.30] but grapple with,
[1124.38 → 1125.22] and I just have a sense
[1125.22 → 1126.18] some of us also
[1126.18 → 1127.52] might be asking this question.
[1128.66 → 1129.68] You read Psalm 8,
[1129.72 → 1130.22] and he's saying,
[1130.40 → 1130.94] what are men?
[1131.06 → 1131.56] What's mankind
[1131.56 → 1132.62] that you're mindful of us?
[1132.78 → 1133.30] Human beings
[1133.30 → 1134.08] that you care for us.
[1134.10 → 1134.62] You've given us
[1134.62 → 1136.02] this privileged position
[1136.02 → 1136.74] over creation,
[1136.92 → 1137.98] and we ask that question,
[1138.74 → 1140.18] why did he give us
[1140.18 → 1142.16] such a privileged,
[1142.16 → 1143.08] privileged ruler,
[1143.64 → 1144.64] like to have rule
[1144.64 → 1145.18] over the world
[1145.18 → 1146.30] when we wreck
[1146.30 → 1147.74] this world so badly?
[1148.66 → 1149.50] You ever ask that question?
[1150.50 → 1151.30] Why do we have
[1151.30 → 1152.22] so much freedom?
[1152.64 → 1152.80] You know,
[1152.84 → 1153.76] my 10-year-old and I,
[1153.90 → 1155.00] when Russia and Ukraine
[1155.00 → 1155.54] went to war,
[1155.62 → 1156.14] he and I were just
[1156.14 → 1157.04] grappling together like,
[1157.34 → 1158.24] how does this happen?
[1158.64 → 1159.62] How do human beings
[1159.62 → 1160.38] get together and say,
[1160.46 → 1161.22] we're going to invade
[1161.22 → 1161.74] this country,
[1161.86 → 1162.50] we're going to build
[1162.50 → 1163.94] artillery and bombs
[1163.94 → 1164.46] and missiles,
[1164.60 → 1164.96] and we're going to
[1164.96 → 1166.22] destroy human lives?
[1166.22 → 1167.68] How do we get to a place
[1167.68 → 1168.64] with our freedom
[1168.64 → 1170.08] to do this kind of stuff?
[1171.00 → 1172.52] And we just lament,
[1172.88 → 1173.38] I think,
[1173.52 → 1174.46] when we look at the news
[1174.46 → 1174.96] and we say,
[1175.30 → 1176.78] with all the privileged
[1176.78 → 1177.54] position we've been
[1177.54 → 1178.08] given in the world,
[1178.18 → 1179.20] look what destruction
[1179.20 → 1179.88] we're causing.
[1181.78 → 1182.70] Humans are a paradox,
[1183.28 → 1183.78] and it doesn't matter
[1183.78 → 1184.48] what faith back end
[1184.48 → 1184.84] you have,
[1185.08 → 1185.82] humans are a paradox.
[1185.96 → 1187.06] We discover penicillin
[1187.06 → 1188.28] and we make nuclear bombs.
[1188.74 → 1189.50] We help women
[1189.50 → 1190.30] have babies
[1190.30 → 1191.08] and we do all this
[1191.08 → 1191.80] medical intervention
[1191.80 → 1192.54] to help them conceive,
[1192.62 → 1193.14] and then we help
[1193.14 → 1193.86] with abortions.
[1194.16 → 1195.26] We build the best
[1195.26 → 1195.68] of friendships
[1195.68 → 1196.76] and we stab people
[1196.76 → 1197.60] in the back.
[1198.50 → 1199.36] That's humanity.
[1200.38 → 1201.46] And maybe as we reflect
[1201.46 → 1202.32] on the murkiness
[1202.32 → 1203.56] and the greed
[1203.56 → 1204.38] and the selfishness
[1204.38 → 1204.86] and the pride
[1204.86 → 1205.84] that runs in all
[1205.84 → 1206.50] of our hearts,
[1206.70 → 1207.80] we must ask
[1207.80 → 1208.92] of Psalm 8 even differently.
[1209.34 → 1210.44] Lord, our Lord,
[1211.24 → 1212.54] how is it that you care
[1212.54 → 1214.32] for us when we are
[1214.32 → 1216.78] so broken and rebellious
[1216.78 → 1217.54] and sinful?
[1218.14 → 1219.50] Why do you concern yourself
[1219.50 → 1220.70] with our short little lives
[1220.70 → 1222.02] during which we create
[1222.02 → 1223.02] so much pain
[1223.02 → 1224.86] and endure so much sadness
[1224.86 → 1226.06] at the hands
[1226.06 → 1227.10] of humans?
[1231.56 → 1232.50] And I think God
[1232.50 → 1233.50] answers that question
[1233.50 → 1235.54] very specifically.
[1236.82 → 1238.02] When Psalm 8 says,
[1238.26 → 1239.28] why do you concern
[1239.28 → 1240.24] yourself for us?
[1240.34 → 1241.28] Why do you care?
[1241.70 → 1242.96] God answers that question,
[1243.12 → 1243.68] get this,
[1244.36 → 1245.06] with a baby.
[1246.34 → 1247.10] His answer
[1247.10 → 1247.92] to the brokenness
[1247.92 → 1248.52] and the rebellion
[1248.52 → 1249.68] and the sin of our world
[1249.68 → 1251.24] is to send a baby
[1251.24 → 1252.22] who will silence
[1252.22 → 1253.40] the foe and the avenger.
[1253.40 → 1257.06] Psalm 8 is quoted
[1257.06 → 1257.94] several times
[1257.94 → 1258.78] in the New Testament
[1258.78 → 1259.72] and one of those times
[1259.72 → 1260.84] is in the book of Hebrews.
[1261.26 → 1261.48] In fact,
[1261.52 → 1262.34] there's a direct quote
[1262.34 → 1262.94] of Psalm 8
[1262.94 → 1263.74] and then it starts
[1263.74 → 1265.42] to talk about Jesus.
[1266.38 → 1267.04] And I want to read
[1267.04 → 1267.86] for you exactly
[1267.86 → 1269.26] what Hebrews 2 says
[1269.26 → 1269.86] about Jesus,
[1270.10 → 1270.68] verse 9.
[1270.68 → 1273.32] But we do see Jesus
[1273.32 → 1274.06] who was made,
[1274.42 → 1275.18] notice the language,
[1275.34 → 1276.04] a little lower
[1276.04 → 1276.64] than the angels
[1276.64 → 1277.62] for a little while,
[1277.84 → 1278.58] now crowned
[1278.58 → 1279.54] with glory and honour
[1279.54 → 1281.74] because he suffered death
[1281.74 → 1283.10] so that by the grace
[1283.10 → 1283.52] of God
[1283.52 → 1284.62] he might taste death
[1284.62 → 1285.90] for everyone.
[1286.66 → 1287.90] In bringing many sons
[1287.90 → 1289.08] and daughters to glory,
[1289.18 → 1290.30] it was fitting that God,
[1290.54 → 1291.66] for whom and through whom
[1291.66 → 1292.86] everything exists,
[1293.20 → 1294.44] should make the pioneer
[1294.44 → 1295.48] of their salvation
[1295.48 → 1296.28] perfect
[1296.28 → 1297.78] through what he suffered.
[1297.78 → 1298.86] both the one
[1298.86 → 1299.96] who makes people holy
[1299.96 → 1301.54] and those who are made holy
[1301.54 → 1303.00] are of the same family.
[1303.48 → 1304.06] And I love this.
[1304.12 → 1305.44] So Jesus is not ashamed
[1305.44 → 1306.98] to call them brothers
[1306.98 → 1308.48] and sisters.
[1309.28 → 1310.12] Now that's a pretty
[1310.12 → 1310.94] dense statement.
[1311.06 → 1311.22] In fact,
[1311.26 → 1311.74] the book of Hebrews
[1311.74 → 1312.74] has a lot of deep stuff.
[1312.82 → 1313.74] But here's the issue.
[1313.86 → 1315.10] Here's the gist of it.
[1316.28 → 1317.18] God's answer
[1317.18 → 1318.44] to the rebellion
[1318.44 → 1319.12] and the brokenness
[1319.12 → 1319.80] and the sin
[1319.80 → 1321.16] that has infected our hearts
[1321.16 → 1322.30] and corrupted our minds
[1322.30 → 1323.08] and our relationships,
[1323.24 → 1324.12] God's answer to that
[1324.12 → 1324.80] is a baby.
[1326.06 → 1326.64] His answer
[1326.64 → 1327.48] is the incarnation.
[1327.78 → 1328.52] And he says,
[1328.66 → 1329.46] I care so much,
[1329.54 → 1330.36] I'm going to send Jesus
[1330.36 → 1331.34] who is fully God,
[1331.44 → 1332.18] who then descends
[1332.18 → 1332.76] to our level
[1332.76 → 1334.06] which is just a little lower
[1334.06 → 1335.10] than the heavenly beings.
[1335.46 → 1336.98] And he is glorified
[1336.98 → 1337.70] and crowned
[1337.70 → 1338.64] through his suffering,
[1339.30 → 1340.56] through his humiliation
[1340.56 → 1341.68] and ultimately
[1341.68 → 1343.10] his death on a cross.
[1344.30 → 1345.62] And God did this
[1345.62 → 1346.56] all on purpose
[1346.56 → 1347.84] so that the enemy,
[1348.00 → 1348.60] that is sin
[1348.60 → 1349.10] and death
[1349.10 → 1349.56] and Satan
[1349.56 → 1350.10] is defeated.
[1350.96 → 1352.22] And we are rescued
[1352.22 → 1353.88] from our awful,
[1354.44 → 1355.90] sin-soaked image bearing
[1355.90 → 1357.80] to be the people
[1357.80 → 1359.20] God created us to be
[1359.20 → 1359.94] in the beginning.
[1361.18 → 1362.22] When palmate asks,
[1362.36 → 1363.12] why do you care?
[1363.20 → 1364.04] How do you care for us?
[1364.10 → 1364.80] God's answer is,
[1365.02 → 1366.00] I care so much,
[1366.22 → 1367.40] I will bring Christ.
[1368.24 → 1369.26] My level of concern
[1369.26 → 1369.78] is so deep
[1369.78 → 1370.60] that I will allow Christ
[1370.60 → 1371.06] to suffer,
[1371.42 → 1372.20] to go to humiliation,
[1372.32 → 1373.34] to go all the way
[1373.34 → 1374.16] to the grave
[1374.16 → 1374.98] as a slave
[1374.98 → 1375.78] for the sake
[1375.78 → 1376.66] of you being healed,
[1377.36 → 1377.74] for the sake
[1377.74 → 1378.72] of you being redeemed,
[1378.98 → 1379.48] for the sake
[1379.48 → 1380.70] of sin being defeated
[1380.70 → 1381.48] and brought to the grave
[1381.48 → 1382.52] once and for all.
[1382.52 → 1383.58] And you,
[1383.82 → 1384.58] says Hebrews 2,
[1384.76 → 1385.48] you get to be
[1385.48 → 1386.34] the brothers and sisters
[1386.34 → 1386.82] of Jesus
[1386.82 → 1388.64] and share in his glory.
[1390.18 → 1390.88] That's the point
[1390.88 → 1391.66] at which you say amen.
[1396.78 → 1397.58] And I believe
[1397.58 → 1398.36] that Psalm 8
[1398.36 → 1399.92] and Hebrews 2 together,
[1400.38 → 1401.20] they have a lot to say
[1401.20 → 1401.66] about the mission
[1401.66 → 1402.20] of the church.
[1403.56 → 1404.42] If you look at
[1404.42 → 1405.10] the whole story
[1405.10 → 1405.62] of the Bible,
[1406.44 → 1407.36] when Jesus comes
[1407.36 → 1408.36] and he dies on the cross,
[1408.42 → 1408.98] it's not just
[1408.98 → 1410.08] cancelling death.
[1410.44 → 1411.44] It's not just saying,
[1411.70 → 1412.18] you're not going
[1412.18 → 1412.92] to hell anymore.
[1413.06 → 1413.48] It's saying,
[1413.64 → 1414.74] you are now redeemed
[1414.74 → 1416.26] to live the fullness
[1416.26 → 1417.40] you were created for.
[1418.50 → 1419.20] You now,
[1419.30 → 1420.26] by the Spirit's work
[1420.26 → 1420.76] in your life,
[1420.82 → 1421.38] by the resurrection
[1421.38 → 1422.06] power of Jesus,
[1422.32 → 1423.36] you get to recover
[1423.36 → 1424.20] what was given to you
[1424.20 → 1425.08] in Genesis 1.
[1425.56 → 1426.50] And you get to start
[1426.50 → 1427.32] tasting what you
[1427.32 → 1428.10] will experience
[1428.10 → 1429.66] after Revelation 22.
[1430.24 → 1431.14] That the glory
[1431.14 → 1431.80] and the honour
[1431.80 → 1432.46] of our humanity
[1432.46 → 1433.70] becomes restored.
[1434.72 → 1435.76] And my deep conviction
[1435.76 → 1437.00] and my hope
[1437.00 → 1437.78] for our church
[1437.78 → 1439.04] is that our evangelism
[1439.04 → 1439.66] is not just,
[1439.94 → 1440.74] you get out of hell
[1440.74 → 1442.00] free by faith in Jesus.
[1442.64 → 1443.70] That one's been tried.
[1443.80 → 1444.74] It doesn't work very well.
[1445.62 → 1446.42] My hope is that
[1446.42 → 1447.48] our evangelism is that
[1447.48 → 1448.80] in our ordinary lives,
[1449.30 → 1450.56] our ordinary parenting,
[1451.00 → 1452.12] our ordinary work
[1452.12 → 1453.32] in the job site
[1453.32 → 1454.32] shows people
[1454.32 → 1454.92] what it means
[1454.92 → 1456.56] to be human.
[1457.64 → 1458.78] Because that's what
[1458.78 → 1460.12] Jesus is after
[1460.12 → 1462.22] in coming to this world.
[1462.70 → 1463.88] That's what the incarnation
[1463.88 → 1465.22] and the crucifixion
[1465.22 → 1465.88] and the resurrection
[1465.88 → 1466.34] are for.
[1466.46 → 1467.82] For God to reclaim
[1467.82 → 1469.30] his sin-soaked world.
[1469.30 → 1470.78] for God to heal us
[1470.78 → 1471.64] of all the burdens
[1471.64 → 1472.20] and the oppression
[1472.20 → 1472.98] and all the sin
[1472.98 → 1473.94] that come to our own hearts
[1473.94 → 1474.46] and say,
[1474.62 → 1475.38] now you're free
[1475.38 → 1477.02] to be the humans
[1477.02 → 1477.90] you were created for.
[1478.12 → 1478.72] Now you're free
[1478.72 → 1479.86] to rule the world
[1479.86 → 1480.98] as caretakers
[1480.98 → 1481.68] and stewards
[1481.68 → 1482.48] who develop
[1482.48 → 1483.40] and create
[1483.40 → 1484.36] and enjoy this world
[1484.36 → 1485.64] as you were created to
[1485.64 → 1486.80] in the beginning.
[1487.86 → 1489.16] And I hope for some of us
[1489.16 → 1489.96] who might be hearing this
[1489.96 → 1490.62] for the first time,
[1490.76 → 1491.52] you're getting a sense
[1491.52 → 1493.38] of how big salvation is.
[1493.38 → 1495.60] that is Jesus saying,
[1495.80 → 1497.30] I've come to free you
[1497.30 → 1498.78] to live in this world
[1498.78 → 1499.94] as you were intended
[1499.94 → 1500.58] to live in it
[1500.58 → 1501.20] from the beginning.
[1501.80 → 1503.80] And when Jesus comes back,
[1504.32 → 1505.24] we will taste
[1505.24 → 1506.38] the glory
[1506.38 → 1507.16] that we were meant
[1507.16 → 1508.34] to be crowned with
[1508.34 → 1509.14] and the honour
[1509.14 → 1509.62] we were meant
[1509.62 → 1511.22] to live with forever
[1511.22 → 1512.48] in the presence
[1512.48 → 1513.44] of Jesus Christ
[1513.44 → 1514.84] and the Father.
[1516.40 → 1517.16] And so I finish
[1517.16 → 1518.20] how the psalm finishes.
[1518.92 → 1520.66] Lord, our Lord,
[1521.26 → 1522.74] how majestic is your name.
[1523.38 → 1524.44] Your character,
[1525.16 → 1525.76] Your work
[1525.76 → 1527.20] in all the earth.
[1528.14 → 1528.44] Amen.
[1529.64 → 1530.68] Would you join me in prayer?
[1534.30 → 1535.48] Father, we thank You
[1535.48 → 1536.30] for this psalm.
[1537.60 → 1539.44] And we join David's question.
[1540.24 → 1540.80] What are we
[1540.80 → 1541.88] that You care for us?
[1542.84 → 1543.94] Small humans
[1543.94 → 1545.00] with short lives
[1545.00 → 1545.96] on this little earth
[1545.96 → 1547.72] and yet You care.
[1548.74 → 1550.14] You concern Yourself.
[1550.96 → 1552.30] And we look at the empty cross
[1552.30 → 1552.92] and we say,
[1553.38 → 1554.18] thank You.
[1555.70 → 1556.58] And we pray
[1556.58 → 1558.30] that You would release us
[1558.30 → 1559.88] to live the fullness
[1559.88 → 1560.68] of our humanity.
[1561.36 → 1562.76] That we would rediscover
[1562.76 → 1563.96] the joy we are created
[1563.96 → 1564.62] to live with
[1564.62 → 1565.92] in relationship with You
[1565.92 → 1567.56] and in one another.
[1568.34 → 1569.66] We pray that we as a church
[1569.66 → 1570.22] would be known
[1570.22 → 1571.84] for valuing human life
[1571.84 → 1572.54] because we know
[1572.54 → 1573.50] who it belongs to.
[1574.30 → 1575.48] We pray that we would be people
[1575.48 → 1576.70] who stand against injustice
[1576.70 → 1579.00] and who seek to serve
[1579.00 → 1580.50] the lowest and the least
[1580.50 → 1581.66] because You care.
[1582.74 → 1584.14] Lord, we ask that our ministry
[1584.14 → 1585.42] and our mission in the world
[1585.42 → 1586.04] would be living
[1586.04 → 1587.14] the fullness of humanity
[1587.14 → 1587.96] You have given us
[1587.96 → 1588.46] in Jesus.
[1589.80 → 1590.42] And to that end,
[1590.48 → 1591.46] we ask that You'd pour out
[1591.46 → 1592.28] Your Holy Spirit
[1592.28 → 1593.76] and make us
[1593.76 → 1595.02] what You've created us to be.
[1595.82 → 1596.14] Amen.
[1596.14 → 1600.82] I invite you to stand with me
[1600.82 → 1602.80] and sing our song of response
[1602.80 → 1604.28] as a song that celebrates
[1604.28 → 1605.30] the power of Jesus.
[1605.30 → 1605.88] Amen.
[1626.58 → 1627.36] Amen.
[1627.36 → 1628.36] Amen.
[1628.36 → 1630.36] Amen.
