[0.00 --> 2.68]  Thank you for that prayer, Brant.
[3.10 --> 6.56]  At a certain point, I felt like you moved from praying to preaching, and it was just beautiful.
[7.56 --> 10.60]  And to our elders and our deacons, welcome to our leadership team.
[11.58 --> 15.06]  I've had several moments in the last season where I've just been so grateful.
[15.06 --> 22.58]  One of those was when there was a condo fire in Langley, seeing the deacons assemble, receive critical gifts to bring to these people.
[22.78 --> 27.74]  And I saw them in the office after the service that Sunday just to write gift cards and cards for them.
[27.76 --> 29.42]  And I thought, this is what it looks like to be deacons.
[30.00 --> 34.86]  And there's been amazing unseen things happening all season long where the deacons are involved in the city.
[34.94 --> 38.32]  They're getting involved in the community, being a generous presence of our church.
[38.40 --> 42.26]  And so I'm very grateful for the leaders, and I just want to say welcome to our elders and our deacons.
[43.88 --> 48.20]  As Sid mentioned, we're going to continue our sermon series on Belong, Believe, Become.
[48.68 --> 51.66]  Last week, we looked at what does it mean to be part of the church?
[52.52 --> 55.18]  What does it mean to be a member of the body of Christ?
[55.82 --> 60.08]  And now you know exactly how to answer anyone who asks you what it means to be part of the church.
[60.66 --> 64.24]  And this week, we're going to look at what it means to believe, what it is that Christians believe.
[64.88 --> 69.00]  And I was regretting the fact that we didn't turn this one sermon into three sermons.
[69.14 --> 70.98]  And so you're going to have to buckle up for this morning.
[71.60 --> 76.04]  And it's a good challenge to have to decide what passes do you preach on for believe?
[76.04 --> 82.52]  And I settled on 1 Corinthians 15, and I invite, if you have a Bible, turn with me to 1 Corinthians 15.
[82.68 --> 84.30]  We're going to read the first nine verses.
[84.30 --> 97.00]  Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you,
[97.44 --> 100.72]  which you have received and on which you have taken your stand.
[101.48 --> 107.06]  By this gospel, you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word that I preached to you.
[107.82 --> 109.48]  Otherwise, you have believed in vain.
[109.48 --> 114.14]  For what I received, I passed on to you as of first importance,
[114.88 --> 117.82]  that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
[118.54 --> 122.70]  that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
[123.20 --> 125.70]  and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.
[126.28 --> 130.86]  After that, he appeared to more than 500 of the brothers and sisters at the same time,
[131.30 --> 133.98]  most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.
[133.98 --> 139.62]  Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all, he appeared to me also,
[139.98 --> 141.52]  as to one abnormally born.
[142.52 --> 146.62]  For I am the least of the apostles, and do not even deserve to be called an apostle,
[146.76 --> 149.02]  because I persecuted the church of God.
[149.88 --> 155.48]  But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect.
[156.22 --> 161.26]  No, I worked harder than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was in me.
[161.26 --> 168.66]  Whether then it is I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.
[173.70 --> 179.34]  I want you to imagine yourself back at that park, at Hillcrest Park, across the road.
[179.48 --> 181.28]  If you were here last week, we started with this.
[181.62 --> 185.02]  You're sitting on a bench, you're talking with your neighbor two doors down,
[185.10 --> 188.00]  who's been snooping and following you around on Sunday morning with her dog,
[188.00 --> 191.20]  and she's been asking you questions about what you believe,
[191.28 --> 193.16]  and asking you questions about why you're part of the church,
[193.28 --> 196.12]  and you've been able to share with her why you're part of a church,
[196.46 --> 199.98]  why you go and worship on Sunday mornings, even in seasons like this.
[200.70 --> 203.48]  And then after talking about this for a while, she paused and she says,
[203.62 --> 208.12]  okay, so what is it then that Christians believe?
[210.06 --> 211.50]  What would you say to that question?
[211.50 --> 214.80]  What's the first thing that comes to your mind?
[215.26 --> 217.06]  What is it that Christians believe?
[218.30 --> 219.58]  What would you say? You can say it out loud.
[222.12 --> 223.48]  Jesus died for our sins.
[224.36 --> 225.26]  Is that the same thing you said?
[225.34 --> 227.42]  Pastor Sid went first, so he better get this right.
[230.08 --> 231.34]  Anything else that comes to mind?
[232.64 --> 233.80]  This is God's world.
[236.80 --> 238.36]  Redemption. One word. Look at that.
[240.04 --> 240.68]  Anyone else?
[240.68 --> 244.32]  Christ is coming again.
[246.10 --> 246.42]  Amen.
[247.46 --> 248.90]  Yeah, there's so much you could say.
[249.50 --> 251.12]  In fact, you'd almost feel pressure to say,
[251.22 --> 253.04]  okay, how do I make sure I'm not forgetting anything?
[253.52 --> 255.88]  You want to tell them that the Bible is God's word.
[255.96 --> 257.60]  You want to tell them that Jesus is God,
[257.66 --> 259.10]  and that we're sinners in need of a savior.
[259.38 --> 261.76]  You want to tell them that the creation belongs to the Lord,
[261.92 --> 263.00]  and he's going to heal it.
[263.40 --> 265.60]  And you want to tell them about the power of the Holy Spirit.
[266.00 --> 269.10]  It's hard to summarize in one succinct statement.
[269.10 --> 271.14]  This is what we believe.
[271.54 --> 273.62]  And that's what Paul's doing in our passage.
[274.32 --> 276.04]  This is what we believe.
[276.04 --> 281.20]  Now, if there's one word that Christians use the most to describe the essence,
[281.32 --> 282.82]  the core of the Christian faith,
[283.82 --> 284.48]  what is it?
[284.52 --> 285.10]  You know what the word is?
[287.10 --> 287.46]  Gospel.
[289.22 --> 292.90]  Gospel is the word that seems to be used the most to describe,
[292.98 --> 293.98]  and this is throughout history,
[293.98 --> 296.38]  to describe what it is that Christians believe.
[296.38 --> 298.08]  If you go to a Christian bookstore,
[298.54 --> 301.98]  you'll see that most of the books are going to say gospel somewhere on them.
[302.14 --> 303.10]  Gospel-centered preaching.
[303.26 --> 304.08]  Gospel-centered worship.
[304.42 --> 305.46]  Gospel-centered parents.
[305.68 --> 307.56]  Gospel, gospel, gospel.
[307.66 --> 308.58]  And it's this way,
[308.86 --> 311.44]  because the word used most often in the New Testament
[311.44 --> 314.40]  to describe the new, what we believe is,
[315.18 --> 315.60]  gospel.
[316.54 --> 318.24]  I mean, listen to what Paul says in our passage.
[318.44 --> 318.84]  He says,
[318.84 --> 319.86]  Now, brothers and sisters,
[320.08 --> 321.36]  I want to remind you of what?
[321.72 --> 323.56]  The gospel I preach to you,
[323.86 --> 324.84]  by which you have received
[324.84 --> 326.36]  and on which you have taken your stand.
[326.60 --> 327.56]  By this gospel,
[328.00 --> 329.60]  you are saved.
[330.42 --> 331.06]  So clearly,
[331.20 --> 332.46]  this is an important thing.
[332.82 --> 333.54]  They've received it,
[333.58 --> 334.48]  they took their stand on it,
[334.50 --> 336.82]  and the gospel is what saves them.
[337.54 --> 338.52]  So it's important.
[339.72 --> 340.68]  Now, this word gospel,
[341.14 --> 341.88]  I don't know if you know this,
[341.92 --> 343.60]  it simply means good news.
[344.42 --> 345.34]  That's what gospel means,
[345.44 --> 346.62]  good news.
[346.62 --> 350.10]  It's a common word in the Roman world.
[351.06 --> 353.14]  It wasn't just exclusive to early Christians.
[353.32 --> 354.42]  In fact, it was one of those words
[354.42 --> 355.86]  that everyone would be familiar with.
[356.48 --> 357.12]  It was known,
[357.24 --> 358.38]  we know in one context
[358.38 --> 359.62]  that the word gospel is used in
[359.62 --> 361.56]  was when the Caesar or the emperor at the time
[361.56 --> 363.22]  would win a war against another nation.
[363.68 --> 364.80]  A person, a messenger,
[364.88 --> 366.06]  would run into the middle of the city
[366.06 --> 366.30]  and say,
[366.64 --> 367.34]  Good news!
[367.74 --> 368.14]  Gospel!
[368.96 --> 370.16]  We have won the war!
[371.02 --> 372.92]  Or if a royal child was born,
[373.02 --> 374.06]  that same messenger would run
[374.06 --> 374.82]  into the middle of the city
[374.82 --> 375.02]  and say,
[375.22 --> 376.02]  Good news!
[376.02 --> 377.50]  A child has been born
[377.50 --> 378.52]  to the Caesar and his wife.
[378.62 --> 379.80]  We have an heir to the throne.
[380.80 --> 381.62]  That's how it was used.
[381.68 --> 383.02]  And the New Testament writers said,
[383.66 --> 384.90]  We're going to use that
[384.90 --> 388.34]  to describe the center of our faith.
[389.32 --> 390.88]  And so you start the gospel of Matthew.
[390.96 --> 392.12]  What does he say at the very beginning?
[392.80 --> 394.50]  The beginning of the gospel.
[395.22 --> 396.90]  The beginning of the good news
[396.90 --> 398.54]  about Jesus Christ.
[399.90 --> 400.38]  Gospel.
[400.38 --> 403.44]  Now Paul makes sure we understand
[403.44 --> 405.16]  what he means when he says gospel
[405.16 --> 406.36]  in 1 Corinthians 15.
[406.74 --> 408.22]  And he continues to describe
[408.22 --> 409.68]  what it is that he's talking about.
[409.72 --> 410.00]  He says,
[410.12 --> 410.90]  For what we received,
[410.96 --> 411.62]  for what I received,
[411.88 --> 412.86]  I passed on to you
[412.86 --> 414.64]  as of first importance.
[414.82 --> 415.94]  This is like critical,
[416.16 --> 416.92]  base level,
[417.04 --> 417.88]  essential stuff.
[418.42 --> 420.32]  That Christ died for our sins
[420.32 --> 421.62]  according to the scriptures.
[422.44 --> 423.14]  That he was buried.
[423.26 --> 423.90]  And he says that
[423.90 --> 424.70]  because there was doubt
[424.70 --> 425.76]  about him actually dying.
[425.76 --> 427.24]  So he died and he was buried,
[427.36 --> 428.04]  actually dead.
[428.54 --> 429.66]  And that he was raised
[429.66 --> 430.66]  on the third day
[430.66 --> 431.68]  according to the scriptures.
[432.86 --> 433.70]  That's what he says.
[434.52 --> 435.90]  That's the gospel.
[437.42 --> 439.20]  Now if you had no understanding,
[439.30 --> 439.90]  if you're the neighbor
[439.90 --> 441.46]  talking to you on the bench,
[441.82 --> 442.98]  if you had no understanding
[442.98 --> 443.84]  of the Christian faith,
[444.36 --> 445.62]  and this is all you heard
[445.62 --> 446.60]  from 1 Corinthians 15,
[446.68 --> 447.54]  you would know at least
[447.54 --> 448.62]  the gospel is about Jesus.
[449.44 --> 450.38]  It's about him dying,
[450.68 --> 451.24]  being buried,
[451.42 --> 452.66]  and rising according
[452.66 --> 453.46]  to the scriptures.
[453.88 --> 454.74]  That's what you would know.
[455.76 --> 458.06]  And Paul wants to be clear,
[458.12 --> 458.74]  and I want to say this
[458.74 --> 459.76]  this morning as clear as I can.
[460.06 --> 461.40]  Without these things,
[461.88 --> 463.42]  the entire edifice
[463.42 --> 465.10]  of Christian faith
[465.10 --> 467.18]  and teaching collapses.
[467.84 --> 468.08]  In fact,
[468.12 --> 469.18]  in just a few verses later,
[469.54 --> 470.32]  people are denying
[470.32 --> 470.90]  the resurrection.
[471.16 --> 471.52]  In Corinthians,
[471.62 --> 472.16]  you should know that.
[472.20 --> 472.78]  There's questions about
[472.78 --> 473.98]  whether the resurrection happened.
[474.42 --> 474.84]  And Paul says,
[475.08 --> 476.64]  if Jesus didn't rise from the dead,
[476.70 --> 478.02]  if he stayed in the grave,
[478.38 --> 479.40]  everything we believe
[479.40 --> 479.92]  is useless,
[480.22 --> 481.32]  you're all a bunch of fools,
[481.32 --> 482.46]  and we are to be pitied
[482.46 --> 483.64]  more than all other people.
[483.64 --> 485.76]  So this is the center
[485.76 --> 486.26]  of it all.
[487.36 --> 489.04]  And Paul opens up
[489.04 --> 489.96]  several important things.
[490.02 --> 490.52]  I want to highlight
[490.52 --> 491.22]  two features
[491.22 --> 492.22]  of this passage first.
[492.66 --> 493.56]  One is,
[494.32 --> 495.56]  he describes the gospel
[495.56 --> 498.14]  not as ideas
[498.14 --> 499.78]  to be thought about,
[500.06 --> 501.90]  but events that happened.
[502.42 --> 503.86]  That's a really important piece.
[504.28 --> 505.60]  This is not just a few ideas
[505.60 --> 506.42]  on how to live your life.
[506.48 --> 507.80]  It's not just some teaching
[507.80 --> 508.66]  about dimensions
[508.66 --> 509.66]  of what it means to be human.
[509.88 --> 511.34]  It's events that happened
[511.34 --> 513.08]  that changed the course of history.
[513.96 --> 515.06]  In our surge group
[515.06 --> 515.88]  this past week,
[516.66 --> 517.46]  we're looking at
[517.46 --> 518.78]  the story of the Bible as a whole.
[519.20 --> 519.90]  And there's a story,
[519.96 --> 520.92]  I think I've shared it before,
[521.26 --> 522.66]  of a missionary in India
[522.66 --> 523.42]  giving a Bible
[523.42 --> 524.64]  to a Hindu scholar.
[525.68 --> 526.52]  He read that Bible
[526.52 --> 527.60]  start to finish,
[528.00 --> 528.88]  gives the Bible back
[528.88 --> 529.50]  to the missionary,
[529.50 --> 529.96]  and he says,
[530.14 --> 532.38]  this is nothing like
[532.38 --> 533.38]  other religious books.
[534.14 --> 535.26]  This isn't just some teaching.
[535.46 --> 536.60]  This isn't just some instruction.
[537.02 --> 538.34]  This is about events
[538.34 --> 540.48]  that shape the entire world
[540.48 --> 541.56]  from beginning to end.
[541.74 --> 543.02]  There's nothing like this
[543.02 --> 544.02]  in religious literature.
[545.18 --> 546.38]  Paul says the gospel
[546.38 --> 547.54]  is events
[547.54 --> 548.84]  that we're witness to.
[548.90 --> 550.20]  He goes for quite a while
[550.20 --> 550.42]  saying,
[550.70 --> 551.72]  we saw this.
[551.98 --> 553.54]  We saw the resurrected Jesus.
[553.68 --> 554.56]  He appeared to the disciples.
[554.70 --> 555.74]  He appeared to James.
[555.82 --> 556.72]  He appeared to me
[556.72 --> 557.42]  at Normally Born.
[557.46 --> 558.98]  He appeared to 500 men and women.
[559.26 --> 561.16]  We're witnesses to events.
[562.22 --> 562.88]  Really important.
[563.66 --> 564.70]  But equally important
[564.70 --> 565.36]  is number two,
[565.78 --> 567.28]  these events took place
[567.28 --> 568.56]  in part of a story
[568.56 --> 569.98]  that makes sense of them.
[570.88 --> 572.06]  And what I mean by that as well
[572.06 --> 573.14]  is if you went to someone
[573.14 --> 573.78]  and you said,
[573.84 --> 574.54]  you know what I believe?
[575.20 --> 576.36]  I believe that Jesus died,
[576.50 --> 577.00]  he was buried,
[577.08 --> 577.80]  and he was raised.
[578.22 --> 579.50]  They'd probably look at you
[579.50 --> 579.98]  and say,
[580.84 --> 583.30]  and what does that mean?
[584.14 --> 585.54]  The events by themselves
[585.54 --> 586.90]  don't make a lot of sense,
[586.96 --> 587.26]  do they?
[587.86 --> 588.58]  Jesus died,
[588.68 --> 589.06]  he was buried,
[589.12 --> 589.56]  he was raised.
[589.78 --> 590.84]  What does it mean?
[591.20 --> 592.00]  They require you
[592.00 --> 593.12]  to tell the story.
[593.70 --> 594.22]  And Paul,
[594.38 --> 594.94]  just like us,
[595.02 --> 596.18]  knows that a story
[596.18 --> 596.98]  makes sense
[596.98 --> 597.88]  of how important
[597.88 --> 598.58]  these events are.
[598.96 --> 599.98]  In the Roman story,
[600.52 --> 601.94]  Jesus was just another person
[601.94 --> 603.06]  who resisted the Caesar,
[603.22 --> 604.44]  he resisted the Roman rule,
[604.74 --> 605.42]  he got in trouble
[605.42 --> 606.12]  with the wrong people,
[606.20 --> 606.86]  and they killed him
[606.86 --> 607.46]  on a cross.
[608.10 --> 608.64]  Lots of people
[608.64 --> 609.84]  were crucified before Jesus,
[610.10 --> 610.74]  number of people
[610.74 --> 611.74]  crucified after him.
[611.92 --> 613.10]  That's the end of the story.
[613.88 --> 614.98]  That's the Roman telling
[614.98 --> 615.84]  of a crucifixion.
[616.46 --> 617.44]  But Paul says,
[617.52 --> 618.32]  in the words that carry
[618.32 --> 619.48]  a whole lot of freight
[619.48 --> 620.32]  in this passage,
[620.82 --> 621.46]  he died,
[621.60 --> 622.20]  and he was buried,
[622.32 --> 623.10]  and he was raised
[623.10 --> 625.08]  according to the scriptures.
[625.08 --> 627.60]  That's the story
[627.60 --> 628.94]  that makes sense
[628.94 --> 629.98]  of everything Jesus
[629.98 --> 630.76]  came to do
[630.76 --> 632.60]  and all that he accomplished
[632.60 --> 633.62]  in and through
[633.62 --> 635.16]  his death and resurrection.
[636.02 --> 636.88]  The story.
[638.80 --> 640.30]  I want to suggest to you
[640.30 --> 642.02]  that when you capture
[642.02 --> 644.04]  the story of the Bible
[644.04 --> 645.98]  and the unfolding narrative
[645.98 --> 646.74]  of the Old Testament,
[646.88 --> 648.82]  the gospel becomes huge.
[649.94 --> 650.72]  And that's why
[650.72 --> 651.06]  at the beginning
[651.06 --> 651.82]  of every Serge year,
[651.90 --> 652.98]  I say the most important
[652.98 --> 653.56]  thing in Serge
[653.56 --> 654.08]  is that we understand
[654.08 --> 655.54]  the story.
[656.20 --> 656.42]  In fact,
[656.48 --> 657.50]  I remember just a few years ago,
[657.60 --> 658.36]  Pastor Sid and I,
[658.40 --> 659.30]  as our church was growing,
[660.12 --> 660.62]  and we were doing
[660.62 --> 661.52]  these membership classes,
[661.76 --> 662.92]  we were sort of off the cuff
[662.92 --> 663.70]  just adding more
[663.70 --> 664.48]  membership classes
[664.48 --> 665.26]  as people came in.
[665.32 --> 666.18]  I don't know if you remember that.
[666.24 --> 666.40]  We're like,
[666.62 --> 667.14]  there's a 101.
[667.32 --> 668.24]  We should probably do a 201
[668.24 --> 669.36]  and a 301
[669.36 --> 670.16]  and a 401.
[670.16 --> 671.56]  And the reason is
[671.56 --> 671.94]  we had people
[671.94 --> 673.14]  from such different backgrounds.
[673.62 --> 674.96]  Some from Catholic traditions,
[675.12 --> 675.90]  some Pentecostal,
[675.98 --> 677.38]  some with zero church background.
[677.48 --> 677.66]  I'm like,
[677.74 --> 678.36]  what do we do
[678.36 --> 679.26]  in these membership classes?
[679.56 --> 680.74]  How do we communicate
[680.74 --> 681.52]  what it is
[681.52 --> 682.60]  that we believe as Christians?
[682.60 --> 684.44]  And what we settled on
[684.44 --> 685.44]  in our membership classes
[685.44 --> 687.30]  is telling the whole story
[687.30 --> 687.82]  of the Bible.
[688.66 --> 689.44]  And the temptation,
[689.64 --> 689.88]  by the way,
[689.92 --> 690.68]  in membership classes
[690.68 --> 691.46]  is to be like,
[691.96 --> 692.26]  okay,
[692.48 --> 693.18]  welcome to hope.
[693.56 --> 694.96]  If you go to a Pentecostal church,
[695.06 --> 695.86]  they're going to teach you this.
[696.06 --> 697.30]  That's not what the Bible says.
[697.34 --> 698.52]  Or if you go to a Baptist church,
[698.60 --> 699.06]  they're going to teach you
[699.06 --> 699.74]  this about baptism.
[699.88 --> 701.10]  That's not what the Bible says.
[701.38 --> 701.84]  We decide,
[701.94 --> 702.34]  we're going to tell
[702.34 --> 703.50]  the whole story of the Bible
[703.50 --> 704.96]  and then we're going to tell them
[704.96 --> 705.76]  how we read it right.
[709.76 --> 710.78]  We still do that.
[710.78 --> 713.70]  But the point was,
[713.80 --> 714.64]  we realize that
[714.64 --> 715.72]  you're not going to understand
[715.72 --> 717.06]  the significance of the death
[717.06 --> 718.00]  and the resurrection of Jesus
[718.00 --> 719.12]  unless you understand
[719.12 --> 719.94]  the rest of the Bible.
[720.28 --> 721.96]  And you're likely going to distort it
[721.96 --> 723.50]  or reduce it in some way.
[723.58 --> 724.92]  And that happens all the time.
[725.30 --> 726.12]  Even in the church.
[726.50 --> 727.86]  I'm struck by how often
[727.86 --> 728.64]  in the church today
[728.64 --> 730.38]  we talk about our faith
[730.38 --> 733.58]  as only an individual relationship
[733.58 --> 734.08]  with Jesus.
[734.46 --> 735.54]  Now that is critical.
[735.64 --> 736.34]  I'm going to talk about that
[736.34 --> 737.08]  in just a minute again.
[737.22 --> 738.26]  That is essential.
[738.26 --> 740.62]  But there's more to it.
[741.22 --> 741.86]  God's got a plan
[741.86 --> 742.98]  for this whole world
[742.98 --> 744.28]  that Paul is calling into view
[744.28 --> 744.84]  when he says,
[745.22 --> 746.40]  he died and he rose
[746.40 --> 748.04]  according to the scriptures.
[748.72 --> 750.06]  Paul's going right back
[750.06 --> 750.72]  to the beginning
[750.72 --> 752.68]  where God created
[752.68 --> 754.20]  the entire world.
[755.18 --> 756.18]  And he's going right back
[756.18 --> 756.80]  to the story
[756.80 --> 757.84]  where God begins
[757.84 --> 758.88]  to unfold his plan
[758.88 --> 760.22]  to heal and renew
[760.22 --> 760.92]  and restore
[760.92 --> 762.28]  the entire world.
[763.26 --> 764.06]  You and I know
[764.06 --> 764.98]  that the final pages
[764.98 --> 765.46]  of the book,
[765.54 --> 766.18]  they end with
[766.18 --> 767.08]  a new heavens
[767.08 --> 768.08]  and a new earth.
[768.46 --> 769.38]  As many authors say,
[769.46 --> 770.06]  the Bible starts
[770.06 --> 770.56]  with a garden
[770.56 --> 771.18]  and it finishes
[771.18 --> 772.48]  with a garden city.
[772.86 --> 773.74]  And in the middle,
[774.16 --> 774.74]  the Old Testament
[774.74 --> 775.60]  narrates for us
[775.60 --> 777.40]  this catastrophic slide
[777.40 --> 779.02]  into rebellion and sin
[779.02 --> 780.26]  where humans say
[780.26 --> 781.40]  to our good and loving Father,
[781.76 --> 782.50]  no thanks,
[782.64 --> 783.72]  we'll take it from here.
[784.52 --> 785.68]  And Genesis 3 to 11,
[785.78 --> 786.18]  they narrate
[786.18 --> 787.68]  a spiraling out of control
[787.68 --> 788.36]  where this thing
[788.36 --> 789.52]  we call sin
[789.52 --> 791.36]  starts to infect
[791.36 --> 792.10]  the human heart,
[792.56 --> 793.56]  human relationships,
[793.90 --> 795.02]  the non-human creation,
[795.02 --> 796.14]  and it just becomes
[796.14 --> 796.84]  a mess.
[797.44 --> 798.06]  By the time we get
[798.06 --> 798.90]  to Genesis 11,
[798.98 --> 799.86]  it's the Tower of Babel,
[800.02 --> 800.88]  which is basically
[800.88 --> 802.74]  Genesis 3 all over again
[802.74 --> 803.78]  on a cultural level.
[804.56 --> 805.54]  The fall starts
[805.54 --> 806.18]  with humans saying,
[806.30 --> 806.66]  no thanks,
[806.70 --> 807.40]  we'll do it on our own.
[807.44 --> 808.42]  And now in the Tower of Babel
[808.42 --> 809.36]  you have a whole culture,
[809.76 --> 810.70]  a whole society
[810.70 --> 811.44]  saying to God,
[811.62 --> 812.34]  no thanks,
[812.50 --> 813.52]  we'll do it on our own.
[815.00 --> 816.12]  And from Genesis 12
[816.12 --> 817.50]  to the end of Malachi,
[818.56 --> 819.66]  God's rolling up
[819.66 --> 820.28]  his sleeves
[820.28 --> 820.84]  and he's saying,
[821.22 --> 822.38]  I'm going to deal
[822.38 --> 823.26]  with sin.
[823.26 --> 825.04]  The thing that is
[825.04 --> 826.36]  wrecking the shalom
[826.36 --> 828.14]  I created you to experience,
[828.48 --> 829.02]  the thing that's
[829.02 --> 829.68]  tearing apart
[829.68 --> 830.60]  human relationships,
[831.02 --> 831.52]  tearing apart
[831.52 --> 832.28]  human communities,
[832.54 --> 833.02]  the thing that is
[833.02 --> 833.60]  keeping people
[833.60 --> 834.52]  at a distance from me,
[834.72 --> 835.64]  I'm going to deal
[835.64 --> 836.12]  with that.
[837.62 --> 839.08]  And so the story unfolds.
[839.14 --> 840.08]  God calls a people
[840.08 --> 840.52]  to himself.
[840.62 --> 841.42]  He rescues them
[841.42 --> 842.02]  from slavery.
[842.38 --> 842.98]  He gives them
[842.98 --> 843.98]  his own presence,
[844.10 --> 844.76]  his protection,
[845.14 --> 845.86]  his instruction
[845.86 --> 846.68]  on how life
[846.68 --> 847.32]  is supposed to be
[847.32 --> 848.12]  lived in his world.
[848.36 --> 849.16]  He protects them
[849.16 --> 850.02]  and places them
[850.02 --> 850.48]  in Canaan
[850.48 --> 850.92]  so they can be
[850.92 --> 851.42]  a blessing,
[851.68 --> 852.52]  not just to themselves,
[852.52 --> 853.76]  but to the entire world.
[854.32 --> 855.30]  The nations need
[855.30 --> 856.46]  to know about this God.
[857.50 --> 857.90]  But if you know
[857.90 --> 858.44]  the story,
[859.14 --> 859.62]  you know that it
[859.62 --> 860.20]  doesn't finish
[860.20 --> 860.72]  with them just
[860.72 --> 861.96]  enjoying God's presence
[861.96 --> 862.46]  in Canaan,
[862.98 --> 863.88]  worshiping him,
[864.24 --> 865.24]  living how he instructed.
[865.36 --> 866.16]  No, it ends
[866.16 --> 867.12]  with this endless cycle
[867.12 --> 867.78]  of rebellion.
[869.24 --> 870.00]  Pushing and saying,
[870.08 --> 871.02]  no, we'll do it
[871.02 --> 871.84]  the way the other nations
[871.84 --> 872.42]  do, God.
[873.10 --> 874.18]  We'll take it from here.
[874.26 --> 874.94]  We know how to run
[874.94 --> 875.60]  life well.
[875.92 --> 876.58]  And you feel
[876.58 --> 877.22]  by the time you get
[877.22 --> 878.10]  to the end of Malachi,
[878.36 --> 879.40]  what is God
[879.40 --> 880.66]  going to do next?
[880.66 --> 882.68]  His people are in exile.
[883.04 --> 883.74]  There's a rejection
[883.74 --> 884.40]  of his law.
[884.52 --> 885.12]  There's a rejection
[885.12 --> 885.90]  of his presence.
[886.14 --> 886.78]  They're experiencing
[886.78 --> 887.86]  pain of foreign rule.
[887.94 --> 889.06]  What's God going to do next?
[889.66 --> 891.28]  This is the story
[891.28 --> 893.42]  that Jesus enters into.
[894.46 --> 895.48]  And it shouldn't surprise
[895.48 --> 896.44]  anyone that when Jesus
[896.44 --> 897.52]  starts his public ministry,
[897.62 --> 898.20]  what's the first thing
[898.20 --> 898.68]  he says?
[899.64 --> 901.24]  Good news.
[902.08 --> 903.54]  The kingdom of God
[903.54 --> 904.24]  has come.
[904.86 --> 905.34]  Repent
[905.34 --> 906.66]  and believe
[906.66 --> 907.72]  the good news.
[907.72 --> 908.76]  That's how he starts
[908.76 --> 909.30]  his ministry.
[909.94 --> 910.78]  Good news, people.
[911.66 --> 912.98]  Everything that God
[912.98 --> 914.50]  has sought to accomplish
[914.50 --> 915.68]  and the plan he worked out
[915.68 --> 916.22]  from the beginning,
[916.54 --> 917.62]  I will accomplish
[917.62 --> 919.38]  in and through my life,
[919.76 --> 920.32]  my death,
[920.56 --> 921.42]  and my resurrection.
[923.52 --> 924.64]  All the promises
[924.64 --> 925.50]  that God made
[925.50 --> 926.06]  in the Old Testament
[926.06 --> 926.78]  to establish
[926.78 --> 928.30]  an everlasting kingdom
[928.30 --> 929.58]  in the line of David,
[929.72 --> 930.62]  2 Samuel 7,
[931.26 --> 932.06]  that's accomplished
[932.06 --> 932.56]  in Jesus.
[932.94 --> 934.08]  The promise to remove
[934.08 --> 934.86]  a heart of stone
[934.86 --> 936.10]  and give a heart of flesh
[936.10 --> 937.26]  to fill people
[937.26 --> 938.04]  with his spirit
[938.04 --> 938.98]  in Ezekiel 36,
[939.20 --> 940.06]  that's accomplished
[940.06 --> 941.00]  in Jesus.
[941.36 --> 942.46]  The promise to fill
[942.46 --> 943.60]  the entire earth
[943.60 --> 944.82]  with the glory of God,
[945.08 --> 946.02]  that's accomplished
[946.02 --> 947.40]  in Christ Jesus.
[947.90 --> 949.16]  The whole story
[949.16 --> 949.78]  has been leaning
[949.78 --> 950.28]  to Jesus.
[950.42 --> 951.18]  And when he steps in
[951.18 --> 951.50]  and he says,
[951.76 --> 952.20]  good news,
[952.28 --> 952.96]  the kingdom of God
[952.96 --> 953.28]  is here.
[953.70 --> 954.52]  Everything God
[954.52 --> 955.26]  has set in motion,
[955.46 --> 956.28]  all of his activity
[956.28 --> 956.98]  throughout the Old Testament
[956.98 --> 958.10]  story is coming
[958.10 --> 958.82]  to his fulfillment
[958.82 --> 959.86]  and his climax
[959.86 --> 960.62]  in Jesus.
[961.86 --> 962.66]  Are you feeling
[962.66 --> 963.32]  the hugeness
[963.32 --> 964.62]  of the gospel?
[964.62 --> 966.56]  A little bit.
[967.90 --> 968.96]  I like to say,
[969.40 --> 970.02]  or at least I think
[970.02 --> 970.78]  I've said it many times
[970.78 --> 971.58]  behind this pulpit,
[972.22 --> 972.78]  that the gospel
[972.78 --> 973.58]  is cosmic,
[974.06 --> 974.68]  it's good news
[974.68 --> 975.28]  for the world,
[975.74 --> 976.44]  it's communal,
[976.60 --> 977.20]  it's good news
[977.20 --> 977.84]  for the church
[977.84 --> 978.42]  and community,
[978.54 --> 979.46]  and it is individual.
[979.80 --> 980.52]  It is good news
[980.52 --> 981.52]  for you personally.
[982.22 --> 983.20]  And I like to say it
[983.20 --> 983.74]  in that order
[983.74 --> 984.54]  because so often
[984.54 --> 985.08]  we default
[985.08 --> 985.80]  to the personal.
[986.82 --> 987.36]  And trust me
[987.36 --> 987.90]  when I say it,
[987.90 --> 988.88]  I want the gospel
[988.88 --> 989.36]  to be personal.
[989.46 --> 990.36]  When I look at my kids,
[990.44 --> 991.08]  two of whom are sitting
[991.08 --> 991.66]  in the front row
[991.66 --> 992.34]  trying to make sense
[992.34 --> 992.82]  of the sermon,
[993.30 --> 994.10]  I want them
[994.10 --> 994.76]  to know Jesus.
[995.02 --> 995.52]  I want them
[995.52 --> 996.16]  to have a personal
[996.16 --> 996.66]  relationship
[996.66 --> 997.52]  and walk with Jesus,
[997.72 --> 998.80]  but I want these two
[998.80 --> 999.60]  kids right here
[999.60 --> 1001.12]  to see the hugeness
[1001.12 --> 1001.92]  of what God's doing
[1001.92 --> 1002.46]  in our world.
[1003.36 --> 1004.50]  I want them to know
[1004.50 --> 1005.20]  that there's coming
[1005.20 --> 1006.22]  a day when there
[1006.22 --> 1007.12]  will be no coronavirus,
[1008.06 --> 1008.96]  when there will be
[1008.96 --> 1009.94]  no more wildfires
[1009.94 --> 1011.56]  that smoke hazes
[1011.56 --> 1012.26]  over our city,
[1012.48 --> 1013.28]  no more people
[1013.28 --> 1014.60]  fleeing their country
[1014.60 --> 1015.12]  of origin
[1015.12 --> 1016.02]  and trying to find
[1016.02 --> 1016.58]  a new home
[1016.58 --> 1017.40]  because they're refugees
[1017.40 --> 1018.26]  because of war.
[1018.58 --> 1019.66]  That day is coming
[1019.66 --> 1020.14]  and sealed
[1020.14 --> 1021.10]  because of the resurrection.
[1021.10 --> 1022.88]  I want my kids
[1022.88 --> 1023.22]  to know
[1023.22 --> 1023.82]  that there's a day
[1023.82 --> 1024.80]  where Hong Kong
[1024.80 --> 1025.92]  and Vancouver Island,
[1026.30 --> 1027.24]  Russia and Argentina
[1027.24 --> 1028.24]  are going to be made new,
[1028.68 --> 1029.44]  made right,
[1029.56 --> 1030.64]  where humans can flourish
[1030.64 --> 1031.56]  in our cities
[1031.56 --> 1032.70]  and our communities again.
[1033.44 --> 1034.40]  That's what God
[1034.40 --> 1035.00]  has accomplished
[1035.00 --> 1035.64]  in Jesus.
[1035.84 --> 1036.28]  The gospel
[1036.28 --> 1037.28]  is good news
[1037.28 --> 1037.92]  for the world
[1037.92 --> 1039.48]  and it's good news
[1039.48 --> 1040.22]  for community.
[1040.78 --> 1041.14]  If you read
[1041.14 --> 1041.76]  the New Testament,
[1042.08 --> 1042.94]  what Paul is giving
[1042.94 --> 1043.86]  thanks for over
[1043.86 --> 1044.80]  and over and over
[1044.80 --> 1045.12]  again,
[1045.28 --> 1046.22]  it's that the resurrection
[1046.22 --> 1047.30]  power of Jesus,
[1047.44 --> 1048.46]  the life that comes
[1048.46 --> 1049.28]  from His rising
[1049.28 --> 1049.90]  from the dead,
[1049.90 --> 1051.48]  is taking place
[1051.48 --> 1052.28]  and taking root
[1052.28 --> 1052.88]  in the church.
[1053.60 --> 1054.26]  And now people
[1054.26 --> 1055.02]  who were once enemies
[1055.02 --> 1055.86]  are reconciling.
[1056.10 --> 1056.68]  People who couldn't
[1056.68 --> 1057.32]  be in the same room
[1057.32 --> 1058.50]  can now share the table
[1058.50 --> 1059.56]  of Jesus Christ
[1059.56 --> 1060.02]  in communion.
[1060.46 --> 1061.70]  Now there's reconciliation
[1061.70 --> 1062.92]  and love.
[1064.08 --> 1065.04]  The gospel is good news
[1065.04 --> 1065.68]  for community.
[1066.48 --> 1067.54]  Sin is forgiven.
[1068.28 --> 1069.62]  Grace is poured out.
[1070.04 --> 1071.36]  Freedom is experienced.
[1071.90 --> 1073.06]  Life is experienced.
[1073.84 --> 1074.88]  The gospel is good news
[1074.88 --> 1075.52]  for community
[1075.52 --> 1077.10]  and the gospel
[1077.10 --> 1077.82]  is good news
[1077.82 --> 1078.76]  for us personally.
[1079.90 --> 1080.84]  The same God
[1080.84 --> 1081.72]  who created
[1081.72 --> 1082.74]  the heavens and the earth,
[1082.82 --> 1083.38]  who ordered
[1083.38 --> 1084.78]  this beautiful creation,
[1085.68 --> 1086.48]  walks with you.
[1087.64 --> 1088.58]  There is no place
[1088.58 --> 1089.10]  you go
[1089.10 --> 1090.38]  that He does not
[1090.38 --> 1091.02]  go with you.
[1091.62 --> 1092.44]  There is no pain
[1092.44 --> 1093.08]  you experience
[1093.08 --> 1093.74]  that He does not
[1093.74 --> 1094.26]  understand.
[1094.56 --> 1095.38]  No joy
[1095.38 --> 1096.34]  you celebrate
[1096.34 --> 1097.18]  that He does not
[1097.18 --> 1098.04]  celebrate with you.
[1098.20 --> 1099.46]  He is a personal God
[1099.46 --> 1100.26]  and as Brant said
[1100.26 --> 1100.80]  so beautifully,
[1101.14 --> 1101.76]  when we pray
[1101.76 --> 1102.36]  to this God,
[1102.58 --> 1103.34]  He listens.
[1103.34 --> 1105.82]  He is a personal God.
[1107.34 --> 1108.08]  And even the last
[1108.08 --> 1108.90]  few weeks and months
[1108.90 --> 1109.72]  I've heard testimonies
[1109.72 --> 1110.34]  in this church
[1110.34 --> 1112.02]  of how this great
[1112.02 --> 1112.98]  sovereign God
[1112.98 --> 1114.80]  is personally involved
[1114.80 --> 1115.64]  in power
[1115.64 --> 1116.36]  and love
[1116.36 --> 1116.94]  and grace
[1116.94 --> 1117.62]  in our church.
[1118.08 --> 1118.94]  And we give thanks
[1118.94 --> 1119.82]  that the good news
[1119.82 --> 1121.08]  is for our world.
[1122.04 --> 1122.88]  It's for community.
[1123.60 --> 1124.40]  It's for the church.
[1124.68 --> 1125.72]  And it is for you
[1125.72 --> 1126.32]  personally.
[1128.02 --> 1129.26]  All of this
[1129.26 --> 1130.72]  is part of the statement
[1130.72 --> 1131.72]  that Paul says
[1131.72 --> 1132.82]  Jesus died
[1132.82 --> 1133.72]  according to the scriptures
[1133.72 --> 1134.46]  for our sin.
[1134.72 --> 1135.34]  He was buried
[1135.34 --> 1136.10]  and He was raised
[1136.10 --> 1136.92]  on the third day
[1136.92 --> 1137.98]  according to the scriptures.
[1138.12 --> 1138.86]  We're witnesses
[1138.86 --> 1140.28]  of the good news
[1140.28 --> 1141.42]  of Jesus Christ.
[1143.56 --> 1144.18]  Now I'm going to
[1144.18 --> 1145.06]  cut myself short
[1145.06 --> 1146.28]  on some of the things
[1146.28 --> 1146.90]  I wanted to say
[1146.90 --> 1147.74]  because I want to focus
[1147.74 --> 1148.46]  on verse 2.
[1149.22 --> 1150.06]  And this is at the advice
[1150.06 --> 1151.14]  of my wife by the way.
[1151.74 --> 1152.66]  So when she says
[1152.66 --> 1153.14]  how I should preach
[1153.14 --> 1153.50]  my sermon,
[1153.60 --> 1153.98]  I listen.
[1154.84 --> 1156.26]  I can see her smirking
[1156.26 --> 1156.86]  through her screen
[1156.86 --> 1157.30]  right now.
[1158.38 --> 1159.12]  In verse 2,
[1159.28 --> 1159.92]  Paul says,
[1160.00 --> 1160.44]  and I want you to
[1160.44 --> 1161.34]  pay attention to this,
[1161.34 --> 1163.00]  he shifts from talking
[1163.00 --> 1163.76]  about the content
[1163.76 --> 1165.04]  of what it is
[1165.04 --> 1165.54]  that we believe
[1165.54 --> 1166.08]  to the act
[1166.08 --> 1167.12]  of believing itself.
[1167.72 --> 1168.22]  And these are
[1168.22 --> 1168.98]  pretty strong words.
[1169.08 --> 1169.52]  He says,
[1170.26 --> 1171.00]  by this gospel
[1171.00 --> 1171.74]  you are saved
[1171.74 --> 1173.76]  if you hold firmly
[1173.76 --> 1174.82]  where is it?
[1174.86 --> 1175.46]  Where am I reading it?
[1175.48 --> 1176.18]  If you hold firmly
[1176.18 --> 1177.12]  to the word I preach
[1177.12 --> 1177.48]  to you,
[1177.60 --> 1178.34]  otherwise you have
[1178.34 --> 1179.26]  believed in vain.
[1180.32 --> 1180.88]  Do you hear that?
[1182.08 --> 1183.06]  Paul's not worried
[1183.06 --> 1183.78]  about the power
[1183.78 --> 1184.44]  of the gospel.
[1184.96 --> 1185.52]  He's not worried
[1185.52 --> 1186.10]  about what Jesus
[1186.10 --> 1187.20]  accomplished for his world
[1187.20 --> 1187.76]  and for the church
[1187.76 --> 1188.52]  and for us personally
[1188.52 --> 1190.02]  when he rose from the dead.
[1190.02 --> 1191.58]  What he's concerned about
[1191.58 --> 1192.90]  is the level of trust
[1192.90 --> 1193.50]  in the church.
[1194.04 --> 1194.74]  That they're rooted
[1194.74 --> 1196.20]  and firmly holding
[1196.20 --> 1197.10]  to this good news.
[1197.44 --> 1198.38]  As one writer puts it,
[1198.42 --> 1198.84]  he says,
[1199.12 --> 1200.10]  Paul affirms
[1200.10 --> 1200.98]  that the gospel
[1200.98 --> 1202.06]  has brought them salvation.
[1202.86 --> 1203.78]  His only reservation
[1203.78 --> 1205.14]  lies in the shakiness
[1205.14 --> 1206.34]  of their faith in Christ.
[1207.00 --> 1208.14]  If the grip of the gospel
[1208.14 --> 1209.30]  is such that they are not
[1209.30 --> 1211.20]  really trusting Christ,
[1211.72 --> 1213.06]  their belief is groundless
[1213.06 --> 1213.56]  and empty.
[1214.62 --> 1215.70]  It's pretty strong.
[1215.70 --> 1218.56]  And that is to say,
[1218.72 --> 1219.44]  and you see this
[1219.44 --> 1220.36]  all over the New Testament,
[1220.78 --> 1221.88]  that believing in Jesus,
[1222.06 --> 1223.20]  believing the gospel
[1223.20 --> 1226.18]  is not just connecting
[1226.18 --> 1227.24]  to a few ideas
[1227.24 --> 1229.20]  or sort of having
[1229.20 --> 1230.98]  this half-hearted interest
[1230.98 --> 1232.02]  in church,
[1232.18 --> 1233.36]  half-hearted commitment
[1233.36 --> 1233.92]  to the church,
[1234.00 --> 1235.26]  like a plan you have
[1235.26 --> 1235.86]  that could shift
[1235.86 --> 1236.86]  if you see something else
[1236.86 --> 1237.38]  better in line.
[1237.52 --> 1238.78]  That's not how it works.
[1239.58 --> 1240.88]  To Paul and to Jesus,
[1240.88 --> 1243.08]  it's a whole-hearted commitment.
[1243.08 --> 1246.46]  It's taking your stand
[1246.46 --> 1248.56]  on these convictions.
[1249.48 --> 1250.02]  It's saying,
[1250.70 --> 1252.08]  my life rests
[1252.68 --> 1253.32]  on the death
[1253.32 --> 1254.34]  and resurrection of Jesus.
[1255.50 --> 1256.30]  He is the king
[1256.30 --> 1257.36]  who now controls
[1257.36 --> 1258.50]  and governs
[1258.50 --> 1259.76]  the whole of it.
[1260.60 --> 1261.20]  Finances,
[1261.50 --> 1262.12]  sexuality,
[1262.46 --> 1262.88]  friendship,
[1263.28 --> 1263.64]  work,
[1263.94 --> 1264.20]  leisure,
[1264.40 --> 1265.52]  all of it lives
[1265.52 --> 1266.16]  under the lordship
[1266.16 --> 1266.92]  of Jesus Christ.
[1267.18 --> 1269.24]  This is who I am.
[1269.24 --> 1270.60]  This is what I believe
[1270.60 --> 1271.64]  with the whole of my being.
[1271.80 --> 1272.84]  That's what Paul's after.
[1273.88 --> 1274.36]  And he's saying
[1274.36 --> 1274.82]  nothing more
[1274.82 --> 1276.12]  than Jesus himself says.
[1276.56 --> 1276.70]  You know,
[1276.74 --> 1277.40]  I'm struck by how
[1277.40 --> 1278.82]  in John 5 or John 6
[1278.82 --> 1279.70]  when Jesus is preaching
[1279.70 --> 1280.38]  about who he is
[1280.38 --> 1281.10]  and what it means to believe,
[1281.28 --> 1282.70]  people walk away from him.
[1283.22 --> 1284.24]  And he says to his disciples,
[1284.40 --> 1285.74]  are you going to desert me too?
[1287.06 --> 1287.88]  Jesus is saying
[1287.88 --> 1288.40]  throughout his,
[1288.64 --> 1290.20]  especially in his parables,
[1290.42 --> 1291.02]  he's telling people,
[1291.16 --> 1292.02]  count the cost.
[1292.64 --> 1293.46]  Know what it is
[1293.46 --> 1294.14]  you're getting into.
[1294.38 --> 1295.50]  This is huge.
[1295.58 --> 1296.26]  It's good news.
[1296.26 --> 1297.02]  But know
[1297.02 --> 1298.08]  you need to count the cost
[1298.08 --> 1298.58]  and recognize
[1298.58 --> 1300.16]  what it means to believe.
[1301.18 --> 1301.56]  And what it means
[1301.56 --> 1302.98]  to turn from another story
[1302.98 --> 1303.80]  that's not true
[1303.80 --> 1305.08]  to faith in Jesus
[1305.08 --> 1306.08]  as Lord of all.
[1306.32 --> 1307.52]  That's a significant shift.
[1307.62 --> 1308.32]  Take it seriously.
[1309.70 --> 1310.62]  And Paul knows,
[1310.66 --> 1311.34]  and I think he speaks
[1311.34 --> 1311.88]  with urgency
[1311.88 --> 1312.80]  because he's aware.
[1313.20 --> 1314.66]  He's living in a Roman empire.
[1314.84 --> 1316.54]  This is a massive story.
[1316.68 --> 1317.32]  They're telling people
[1317.32 --> 1318.16]  what it means to be human.
[1318.42 --> 1319.64]  They're shaping the imagination
[1319.64 --> 1320.72]  on a vision for the good life.
[1320.98 --> 1322.36]  He knows that the power
[1322.36 --> 1322.92]  of this story
[1322.92 --> 1324.42]  sweeps away so many people
[1324.42 --> 1326.14]  so easily.
[1326.72 --> 1327.84]  And the same is true today.
[1328.58 --> 1330.22]  There are such powerful visions
[1330.22 --> 1330.88]  and stories
[1330.88 --> 1331.42]  for what it means
[1331.42 --> 1331.98]  to be human
[1331.98 --> 1333.16]  in the Western culture
[1333.16 --> 1334.58]  that takes the heart
[1334.58 --> 1335.10]  of Christians.
[1336.30 --> 1337.04]  We all know that
[1337.04 --> 1337.74]  in our own families,
[1338.18 --> 1339.28]  our own friendships.
[1340.02 --> 1340.28]  I mean,
[1340.38 --> 1341.38]  I know of so many students,
[1341.46 --> 1342.34]  and this is true for me too,
[1342.72 --> 1343.84]  we grow up with our friends
[1343.84 --> 1344.24]  in church
[1344.24 --> 1345.44]  and they say at a certain point,
[1345.70 --> 1347.02]  I just don't believe this.
[1347.90 --> 1348.58]  And there's some other
[1348.58 --> 1349.26]  compelling vision
[1349.26 --> 1350.32]  that controls their life.
[1350.74 --> 1351.28]  And in the West,
[1351.38 --> 1352.44]  it's so often the vision
[1352.44 --> 1353.76]  of thousands of followers
[1353.76 --> 1354.38]  on Instagram.
[1354.38 --> 1354.54]  Instagram.
[1355.20 --> 1355.96]  It's a big house
[1355.96 --> 1356.92]  filled with good tech.
[1357.42 --> 1358.06]  It's a comfortable
[1358.06 --> 1358.96]  white-collar job
[1358.96 --> 1360.56]  with a hundred six-figure salary
[1360.56 --> 1362.06]  and a fast car.
[1363.10 --> 1364.06]  A few other things like that.
[1364.12 --> 1364.42]  Travel.
[1365.64 --> 1366.38]  That's the vision.
[1367.36 --> 1368.86]  And Paul says to the church then,
[1368.94 --> 1369.56]  and I'll echo it
[1369.56 --> 1370.26]  for the church today,
[1370.72 --> 1372.12]  hold firm
[1372.12 --> 1373.62]  to the gospel
[1373.62 --> 1374.92]  of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1375.44 --> 1377.68]  It is good news.
[1378.56 --> 1380.22]  It is life.
[1381.16 --> 1382.02]  And the story
[1382.02 --> 1383.12]  that so many people
[1383.12 --> 1383.88]  are finding meaning
[1383.88 --> 1384.58]  in your culture
[1384.58 --> 1385.74]  is not.
[1387.16 --> 1388.30]  Hold firm.
[1389.18 --> 1390.58]  Stand on this foundation.
[1390.78 --> 1390.98]  And Stu,
[1391.02 --> 1391.74]  I just want to thank you
[1391.74 --> 1392.76]  for starting our service
[1392.76 --> 1393.62]  with that song,
[1393.72 --> 1394.04]  The Creed.
[1394.26 --> 1396.40]  This is what you stand on.
[1396.92 --> 1397.44]  As a kid,
[1397.56 --> 1397.82]  we would,
[1397.90 --> 1398.14]  I don't know,
[1398.20 --> 1398.82]  maybe some of you
[1398.82 --> 1399.58]  grew up in the CRC,
[1399.66 --> 1400.40]  but we used to stand
[1400.40 --> 1401.06]  and recite The Creed
[1401.06 --> 1402.00]  almost every week.
[1402.62 --> 1403.48]  And there's something right
[1403.48 --> 1404.52]  about standing and saying,
[1404.92 --> 1406.78]  I believe in God our Father.
[1407.40 --> 1409.12]  I believe in Jesus Christ.
[1409.32 --> 1410.92]  I believe in the Holy Spirit,
[1411.00 --> 1411.86]  the virgin birth,
[1411.86 --> 1413.36]  the resurrection of the dead,
[1413.50 --> 1414.32]  I believe it.
[1414.80 --> 1416.04]  This is what I stand on.
[1416.10 --> 1416.90]  These are my convictions.
[1417.34 --> 1418.00]  This is what it means
[1418.00 --> 1418.80]  to be the church
[1418.80 --> 1420.02]  and what makes us
[1420.02 --> 1420.56]  who we are.
[1422.26 --> 1423.66]  And to cycle back
[1423.66 --> 1425.18]  to last week,
[1426.26 --> 1427.92]  this requires a community.
[1428.92 --> 1430.46]  I don't think any one of us
[1430.46 --> 1431.84]  can keep feeding
[1431.84 --> 1432.56]  and nurturing
[1432.56 --> 1433.52]  all on our own
[1433.52 --> 1434.70]  the strength that is needed
[1434.70 --> 1435.40]  to be faithful.
[1436.18 --> 1437.16]  We need brothers
[1437.16 --> 1438.00]  and sisters,
[1438.46 --> 1438.84]  friends,
[1438.84 --> 1439.38]  and family
[1439.38 --> 1439.90]  to nurture
[1439.90 --> 1440.68]  and feed
[1440.68 --> 1441.66]  and strengthen
[1441.66 --> 1442.82]  that faith in us.
[1443.46 --> 1444.58]  That image of the coal
[1444.58 --> 1445.20]  and the fire
[1445.20 --> 1446.44]  is so necessary
[1446.44 --> 1446.94]  when it comes
[1446.94 --> 1447.98]  to standing firm
[1447.98 --> 1449.50]  and holding fast
[1449.50 --> 1450.06]  to the gospel
[1450.06 --> 1451.20]  of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1452.08 --> 1453.62]  I think of my own formation,
[1454.38 --> 1455.98]  my own childhood experience
[1455.98 --> 1456.48]  in the church.
[1456.68 --> 1457.46]  It was so often
[1457.46 --> 1459.52]  watching older people
[1459.52 --> 1459.96]  in the church
[1459.96 --> 1461.44]  who really believed
[1461.44 --> 1462.56]  the gospel
[1462.56 --> 1463.68]  that made me say,
[1463.82 --> 1464.96]  this is good news.
[1465.56 --> 1466.84]  It's watching my parents
[1466.84 --> 1467.86]  who really believed
[1467.86 --> 1468.42]  the gospel.
[1469.06 --> 1470.00]  They couldn't articulate
[1470.00 --> 1470.64]  in all the ways
[1470.64 --> 1471.12]  that I can.
[1471.18 --> 1471.64]  They often say,
[1471.68 --> 1471.98]  I don't know how
[1471.98 --> 1472.46]  you could preach.
[1472.52 --> 1472.78]  And I say,
[1472.88 --> 1474.02]  you lived it in a way
[1474.02 --> 1474.76]  that made it good news
[1474.76 --> 1475.18]  for me.
[1475.70 --> 1476.30]  And in seasons
[1476.30 --> 1477.12]  where I was wondering
[1477.12 --> 1477.84]  and really wondering
[1477.84 --> 1478.30]  what it was
[1478.30 --> 1478.74]  that I believed,
[1478.80 --> 1479.34]  I could remember
[1479.34 --> 1480.88]  the faith of my family,
[1480.98 --> 1481.66]  my extended family
[1481.66 --> 1482.08]  and my church
[1482.08 --> 1482.32]  and saying,
[1482.60 --> 1483.96]  I know that's good news.
[1484.88 --> 1486.30]  I know that this is true.
[1487.06 --> 1488.12]  This is who I am.
[1488.72 --> 1489.48]  Even in seasons
[1489.48 --> 1489.98]  where I needed
[1489.98 --> 1490.94]  to be pulled back in
[1490.94 --> 1492.10]  by the community of faith,
[1493.26 --> 1494.40]  we need each other
[1494.40 --> 1495.94]  to ground and root
[1495.94 --> 1497.62]  and establish us
[1497.62 --> 1499.28]  in these convictions
[1499.28 --> 1500.22]  of what it means
[1500.22 --> 1501.32]  to be followers of Jesus,
[1502.22 --> 1503.14]  to follow the gospel,
[1503.24 --> 1503.88]  the good news.
[1507.76 --> 1508.64]  I want to finish
[1508.64 --> 1509.30]  with a story
[1509.30 --> 1511.14]  that goes back
[1511.14 --> 1512.20]  to the huge gospel
[1512.20 --> 1513.32]  of how one pastor
[1513.32 --> 1514.22]  answered the question,
[1514.52 --> 1515.02]  what is it
[1515.02 --> 1515.94]  that Christians believe?
[1516.72 --> 1517.86]  The pastor in Seattle
[1517.86 --> 1518.98]  who was getting
[1518.98 --> 1519.68]  his hair cut
[1519.68 --> 1521.10]  as Barbara
[1521.10 --> 1521.98]  was cutting his hair
[1521.98 --> 1522.54]  and they're talking
[1522.54 --> 1523.10]  about life
[1523.10 --> 1523.50]  and the barber
[1523.50 --> 1524.30]  asked him what he did
[1524.30 --> 1524.66]  and he said,
[1524.72 --> 1525.30]  I'm a pastor.
[1526.14 --> 1527.02]  The barber was intrigued
[1527.02 --> 1527.76]  because he was
[1527.76 --> 1528.84]  not a huge fan
[1528.84 --> 1529.30]  of the church,
[1529.42 --> 1529.86]  not a huge fan
[1529.86 --> 1530.28]  of Christians
[1530.28 --> 1530.82]  and this guy
[1530.82 --> 1531.56]  now represented
[1531.56 --> 1532.12]  the church
[1532.12 --> 1533.64]  and so they got
[1533.64 --> 1534.08]  to chatting
[1534.08 --> 1534.80]  and the pastor
[1534.80 --> 1535.42]  said to him,
[1536.02 --> 1536.92]  what kind of world
[1536.92 --> 1537.80]  do you want to live in?
[1539.04 --> 1539.78]  The barber said,
[1539.84 --> 1540.58]  I know what kind
[1540.58 --> 1541.04]  of world I want
[1541.04 --> 1541.36]  to live in.
[1541.40 --> 1542.08]  He had really strong
[1542.08 --> 1542.72]  convictions about
[1542.72 --> 1543.82]  environmental justice
[1543.82 --> 1544.62]  and equality
[1544.62 --> 1545.14]  and he shared
[1545.14 --> 1545.66]  how he wanted
[1545.66 --> 1546.20]  to live in a world
[1546.20 --> 1547.02]  where there's no waste.
[1547.52 --> 1548.28]  We're not destroying
[1548.28 --> 1549.28]  the world we live in.
[1549.48 --> 1550.20]  There's not pollution
[1550.20 --> 1550.66]  everywhere.
[1550.80 --> 1551.52]  We're not greedily
[1551.52 --> 1552.66]  sort of destroying
[1552.66 --> 1553.96]  the resources around us.
[1553.96 --> 1554.62]  He's going on
[1554.62 --> 1555.16]  and on about how
[1555.16 --> 1555.62]  he wants to live
[1555.62 --> 1555.88]  in a world
[1555.88 --> 1556.76]  where there's justice
[1556.76 --> 1557.68]  for the marginalized
[1557.68 --> 1558.96]  and there's safety
[1558.96 --> 1560.36]  for the future generations
[1560.36 --> 1561.38]  and after he shared
[1561.38 --> 1561.82]  about this,
[1561.90 --> 1562.64]  the pastor said,
[1563.38 --> 1564.38]  I want to live
[1564.38 --> 1565.14]  in that world too
[1565.14 --> 1567.76]  and because of the
[1567.76 --> 1568.42]  death and resurrection
[1568.42 --> 1568.96]  of Jesus,
[1569.18 --> 1570.26]  I believe that world
[1570.26 --> 1570.74]  is coming.
[1572.18 --> 1573.36]  He has secured
[1573.36 --> 1574.30]  the future
[1574.30 --> 1576.16]  for a new heavens
[1576.16 --> 1577.08]  and a new earth
[1577.08 --> 1578.38]  where all is going
[1578.38 --> 1579.08]  to be made right
[1579.08 --> 1580.94]  and this barber
[1580.94 --> 1581.60]  looked at him
[1581.60 --> 1582.06]  and he said,
[1582.84 --> 1583.24]  nah.
[1584.12 --> 1584.58]  It's like,
[1584.72 --> 1585.10]  yeah,
[1585.72 --> 1586.20]  nah.
[1588.28 --> 1589.70]  And he was so perplexed
[1589.70 --> 1590.32]  and he said to the pastor,
[1590.38 --> 1590.54]  he's like,
[1590.62 --> 1591.14]  I've never heard
[1591.14 --> 1591.92]  any Christian talk
[1591.92 --> 1592.46]  about this.
[1593.02 --> 1593.66]  All I've heard
[1593.66 --> 1594.62]  is generally this idea
[1594.62 --> 1595.18]  that when you die
[1595.18 --> 1595.66]  you go to heaven
[1595.66 --> 1596.70]  if you live a certain way
[1596.70 --> 1597.78]  and the pastor said,
[1597.84 --> 1598.04]  no,
[1598.50 --> 1599.46]  we believe that the death
[1599.46 --> 1600.04]  and resurrection
[1600.04 --> 1601.02]  of Jesus
[1601.02 --> 1601.98]  secures
[1601.98 --> 1603.46]  a new creation.
[1604.70 --> 1605.82]  That barber went home
[1605.82 --> 1606.54]  to his partner
[1606.54 --> 1607.38]  and he said,
[1607.44 --> 1607.76]  you're never going
[1607.76 --> 1608.42]  to believe the conversation
[1608.42 --> 1609.34]  I had with this pastor
[1609.34 --> 1609.86]  today
[1609.86 --> 1610.96]  and I want to check
[1610.96 --> 1611.58]  out his church
[1611.58 --> 1613.24]  because that's good news.
[1615.68 --> 1616.46]  Good news
[1616.46 --> 1617.78]  is what we believe.
[1618.62 --> 1619.24]  We do not have
[1619.24 --> 1619.98]  just good advice,
[1620.38 --> 1621.48]  we don't have good information,
[1621.62 --> 1622.14]  although those things
[1622.14 --> 1622.50]  are true,
[1622.80 --> 1624.32]  we announce good news
[1624.32 --> 1625.54]  that in the death
[1625.54 --> 1626.10]  and resurrection
[1626.10 --> 1626.64]  of Jesus
[1626.64 --> 1627.52]  the future has been
[1627.52 --> 1628.20]  made secure.
[1629.12 --> 1629.56]  Forgiveness
[1629.56 --> 1630.66]  has been unleashed.
[1631.40 --> 1632.64]  Life has been poured out
[1632.64 --> 1633.42]  from the love
[1633.42 --> 1634.22]  of the Father
[1634.22 --> 1635.54]  over his world
[1635.54 --> 1637.38]  over the church
[1637.38 --> 1639.02]  and over you
[1639.02 --> 1639.78]  as a part
[1639.78 --> 1640.52]  of that community.
[1641.38 --> 1641.76]  Hope,
[1641.86 --> 1642.78]  do you believe that?
[1644.12 --> 1644.78]  Let's pray.
[1648.98 --> 1649.46]  Father,
[1649.52 --> 1650.02]  we thank you
[1650.02 --> 1650.74]  that you hold
[1650.74 --> 1651.38]  this world
[1651.38 --> 1652.46]  in your hands
[1652.46 --> 1654.84]  and we pause
[1654.84 --> 1656.44]  as part of this church
[1656.44 --> 1657.36]  to thank you
[1657.36 --> 1658.40]  for the way
[1658.40 --> 1659.28]  you have brought us
[1659.28 --> 1659.78]  to faith.
[1660.86 --> 1661.46]  We thank you
[1661.46 --> 1662.26]  for the friends,
[1663.10 --> 1664.04]  the family members,
[1664.46 --> 1665.02]  the neighbors,
[1665.54 --> 1666.12]  and the people
[1666.12 --> 1666.84]  who have made
[1666.84 --> 1667.96]  the gospel plausible
[1667.96 --> 1668.62]  to us
[1668.62 --> 1669.36]  in their lives
[1669.36 --> 1670.12]  and in their deeds.
[1671.22 --> 1672.14]  We thank you
[1672.14 --> 1672.70]  for the way
[1672.70 --> 1673.84]  that we get to bear witness
[1673.84 --> 1674.86]  to this good news
[1674.86 --> 1675.46]  in our city,
[1676.34 --> 1677.58]  in our families,
[1678.30 --> 1679.50]  in our workplaces,
[1679.62 --> 1680.36]  with our friends.
[1681.28 --> 1682.10]  And we pray,
[1682.32 --> 1682.40]  Lord,
[1682.48 --> 1683.80]  that you would root us
[1683.80 --> 1686.02]  and establish us
[1686.02 --> 1687.94]  and ground us
[1687.94 --> 1689.14]  in the good news
[1689.14 --> 1690.24]  of what Jesus has done.
[1690.24 --> 1692.48]  and that as we grow
[1692.48 --> 1693.36]  and as we mature
[1693.36 --> 1694.52]  as a body of believers,
[1694.66 --> 1695.42]  we would see more
[1695.42 --> 1696.30]  and more the beauty
[1696.30 --> 1697.76]  and the glory
[1697.76 --> 1699.62]  and the stunning grace
[1699.62 --> 1700.40]  that we find
[1700.40 --> 1701.02]  in the death
[1701.02 --> 1702.00]  and the resurrection
[1702.00 --> 1702.54]  of Jesus.
[1703.32 --> 1704.28]  Thank you, God.
[1704.86 --> 1705.18]  Amen.
[1707.92 --> 1709.12]  I invite you to stand
[1709.12 --> 1709.66]  and worship
[1709.66 --> 1710.30]  as we sing
[1710.30 --> 1711.58]  our song of response,
[1711.78 --> 1712.42]  Build Your Kingdom.
[1712.42 --> 1712.48]  Thank you.
