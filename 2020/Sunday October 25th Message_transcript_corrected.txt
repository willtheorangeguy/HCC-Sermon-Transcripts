[0.00 → 8.76] well good morning hope it is good to gather around the word and dwell in the scriptures
[8.76 → 14.00] together this morning and again I want to say hello to those of you haven't seen in a while
[14.00 → 19.34] it's always nice to see the faces of our congregation and this morning the 9 a.m. and
[19.34 → 23.00] the 11 a.m. I see some new faces, and we're just delighted that you can worship with us in person
[23.00 → 29.38] again I hope you have been enjoying this series on first Thessalonians as much as I have I am
[29.38 → 35.16] coming to realize it has so much to say to leaders and every time I prepare a sermon I just can't uh
[35.16 → 40.66] I can't believe how much it's saying to the leaders of the church and uh this morning I'm going to be
[40.66 → 46.58] coming to the end of the first half of Thessalonians uh just so you know in the big structure there's
[46.58 → 52.20] three prayers in Thessalonians and two halves and the first half is really about gratitude and
[52.20 → 56.14] thanksgiving and giving praise to god for what he's doing in the church and the second half which
[56.14 → 61.10] pastor SID will be starting next week Paul puts his finger on these places where there needs to be
[61.10 → 66.30] growth where there are these idols that need to be named and change that needs to happen and so that's
[66.30 → 72.32] going to be starting next week I get all the fun stuff so turn with me to uh first Thessalonians 2
[72.32 → 74.56] I'm going to start reading in verse 17
[74.56 → 89.38] but brothers and sisters when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time in person
[89.38 → 96.34] not in thought out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you for we wanted to come to you
[96.34 → 104.48] certainly i Paul did again and again but Satan blocked our way for what is our hope our joy or
[104.48 → 110.74] the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our lord Jesus when he comes is it not you indeed
[110.74 → 116.90] you are our glory and joy so when we could not stand it no longer could stand it no longer we thought
[116.90 → 123.02] it is best to be left on ourselves in Athens we sent timothy who was our brother and co-worker in god's
[123.02 → 128.34] service and spreading the gospel of Christ to strengthen and encourage you in your faith so
[128.34 → 134.82] that no one would be unsettled by these trials you know quite well that we were destined for them in
[134.82 → 140.10] fact when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted, and it turned out that way
[140.10 → 146.08] as you well know for this reason when I could not stand it any longer I sent to find out about your
[146.08 → 151.54] faith I was afraid that in some way the tempter attempted you and that our labours might have been in
[151.54 → 157.70] vain but timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love
[157.70 → 163.22] he has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us, and you long to see us just as we long to see
[163.22 → 169.10] you therefore brothers and sisters in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about
[169.10 → 176.42] you because of your faith for now we really live since you are standing firm in the lord how can we
[176.42 → 181.78] thank god enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our god because of you
[181.78 → 188.26] night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith
[188.26 → 195.72] now may our god and father himself and our lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you
[195.72 → 202.04] may the lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else just as ours does
[202.04 → 208.04] for you may he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our
[208.04 → 212.58] god and father when our lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones
[212.58 → 225.52] but a week and a half ago while driving I was listening to talk radio because I'm old now and that's
[225.52 → 231.18] what you do when you get old and I was listening to an interview with two different people who had been
[231.18 → 236.48] separated from their loved ones one was separated from her fiancé the other was separated from her family
[236.48 → 241.38] by the border closure between Canada and the U.S., and they were interviewing them on what it's been like
[241.38 → 245.68] to be separated from family so long and these two people were sharing their stories and also lobbying
[245.68 → 250.90] the government to create some concessions for family to visit, but you could hear as they shared the
[250.90 → 256.46] difficulty in being away from their families the inability to just cross the border, and they shared that
[256.46 → 261.86] because of work and quarantine it's impossible for them to see their family without losing their jobs
[261.86 → 267.34] the interviewers as they're asking questions made a clear point of saying what has it been like for
[267.34 → 274.94] you and in both cases they shared as they choked up the difficulty they were homesick they were so tired
[274.94 → 279.94] of being at a distance one even said honestly I was finding all the ways I could possibly break the rules
[279.94 → 287.52] and break the protocols because I just wanted to be home but in the end they were stuck they couldn't
[287.52 → 291.96] move they didn't have the power or the authority to break these things, and they were at a distance
[291.96 → 298.42] feeling that homesickness now I'm guessing there are a few people even in our own church who might be
[298.42 → 303.20] going through that right now you have loved ones in the states, and you just want to be with them
[303.20 → 311.00] and if you feel that you know what Paul is feeling in first Thessalonians in fact if Paul had it hid
[311.00 → 316.08] with his way he would not be writing a letter he'd be with the church he's writing a letter because he
[316.08 → 322.14] can't be with the Thessalonian church and if you know this letter you can tell that Paul is just grieved
[322.14 → 328.88] by the distance he says to them, we're like orphaned from you, we are separated against our will we tried
[328.88 → 334.16] to go we tried to go we tried to go, but we couldn't Satan blocked our way and now I have to write you
[334.16 → 341.68] because I'm concerned about you and I love you when I read this passage I'm sure you felt what I feel
[341.68 → 350.16] and that is that Paul really loves this church I mean there is such deep affection from Paul to this
[350.16 → 357.38] little group of believers in Thessalonians he just loves them so dearly and I think we need to
[357.38 → 361.98] understand that his love for them is not just because they believe the message which is true
[361.98 → 366.98] it's not just because he prays so night and day which is also true in our passage, but it's also
[366.98 → 375.22] because he planted that church, and he knows them like this is his faith family I don't know if you
[375.22 → 379.60] know any church planters or if you've ever been part of a church plant in the past but that bond
[379.60 → 385.10] between the planter and that core group of crazies who are bought in and sold out, and they want to make
[385.10 → 389.68] this thing happens they're praying for the city they're visioning for the city that's a really
[389.68 → 396.04] deep bond in fact there might even be a few people in this room who are part of the plant of hope
[396.04 → 402.14] community church and remember that sense of dreaming and visioning and asking that god would use this
[402.14 → 409.86] tiny little core believers to bless the city Paul loves this church they are his faith family
[409.86 → 415.68] in fact as Jonathan preached last week which by the way I really wanted to preach last week I'm still
[415.68 → 418.98] jealous I didn't get to preach on it so I'm just going to say a few more words about what Jonathan
[418.98 → 423.80] preached on but some of the language Paul used he says to the church we were like fathers to who loved
[423.80 → 429.62] you we were like nursing mothers to you, we were like children to you, he uses as much family language
[429.62 → 435.86] as he could possibly use but here's my favourite line in chapter two he says we were delighted
[435.86 → 445.94] not just to share the gospel with you but to share our very lives as well when you picture Paul
[445.94 → 451.44] planting this church preaching the gospel do not picture just a travelling evangelist
[451.44 → 458.52] picture someone who shares meals with these believers picture someone who sits down with them
[458.52 → 465.62] for extended conversations well into the night about faith but the work I picture Paul counselling
[465.62 → 470.12] couples who are struggling I picture him sitting down with a young guy who's struggling at work with
[470.12 → 474.72] what it means to be a believer I picture him talking to single people about the difficulties of being
[474.72 → 480.84] single Paul loved this church and I actually imagine this is not hard to imagine for me that Paul
[480.84 → 485.28] worked with some of them just in this previous chapter Paul says I didn't want to burden any of you i
[485.28 → 490.96] worked I made sure that I was providing for myself I can imagine Paul working building labouring with his
[490.96 → 499.80] hands with his church he shared life with them and I think any healthy church will be a church
[499.80 → 506.32] where ministry is not just talking but the sharing of life the sharing of meals the sharing of worship
[506.32 → 513.32] the sharing of prayer the bonding together of believers and that's precisely why covid is so hard
[513.32 → 517.96] for church right now because it disintegrates that sense of shared life that sense of connectedness
[517.96 → 524.28] connectedness that sense of being one body together for Paul this is not just a ministry project
[524.28 → 532.52] this is shared life and I have to say that it's worth pointing out that we have a pastor in our own
[532.52 → 539.38] church who's modelled this vision of ministry so well pastor SID many of you know him in fact you all know
[539.38 → 546.68] him he has been doing this kind of ministry for almost 25 years in our church SID is not and he'll agree
[546.68 → 551.68] with this he's right there he is not a program builder he's not administrator he's not someone
[551.68 → 556.26] who concerns himself too much with the finances the details of the church but what he's very good at
[556.26 → 562.02] is sharing his life with the church he's the kind of pastor who will be in your backyard
[562.02 → 567.88] asking about your family asking about your kids talking about the struggles you're going through with
[567.88 → 576.80] and sharing his life listening receiving praying that's SID's vision and I just give thanks SID
[576.80 → 581.96] for the way in which you've done that for almost a quarter-century a quarter-century in March it will
[581.96 → 588.10] have been 25 years of sharing life in this particular community big shoes to fill for this pastor right here
[588.10 → 593.80] but we give thanks for that ministry that's not just words it's not just ideas it's not living at a distance
[593.80 → 597.82] it's sharing life, and we give thanks to the lord for that yeah we can clap
[597.82 → 608.06] now where was I so Paul's grieving his distance from the church he wants to make sure the church
[608.06 → 613.30] knows that if he could be there he would, and he gives us very intriguing reason for not being there
[613.30 → 618.88] he says I tried over and over and over again to be there and guess what Satan blocked my way
[618.88 → 624.94] don't you find that intriguing explanation in other passages in acts for example as they're
[624.94 → 630.34] doing these different missionary journeys Paul says the Holy Spirit directed us
[630.34 → 634.20] elsewhere and god seemed to work through the community as they prayed to make sure they went
[634.20 → 641.38] to this city and not that city but in this passage Paul says Satan blocked our way and I have to admit
[641.38 → 646.48] I'm a little frustrated that he didn't just write one more sentence about exactly what that looked like
[646.48 → 652.30] what did you mean Paul when you said Satan blocked your way from going back to be with the Thessalonian
[652.30 → 658.00] church and there are a lot of different ideas given by scholars I tend to agree if I had to pick one
[658.00 → 665.38] reason it would be that Paul sees not just persecution on the church and himself from corrupt people and
[665.38 → 670.42] corrupt leadership in Rome he sees behind the work of these corrupt people that are seeking to kill
[670.42 → 678.46] Christians he sees behind all that the work of the evil one who does actively seek to undo the good
[678.46 → 685.36] work of the church to undo the good work of Jesus Christ in cities and communities not just then but
[685.36 → 691.12] also now and so Paul named Satan as the reason he can't be there and Satan by the way shows up again
[691.12 → 696.28] in verse 5 Paul's not just talking about how Satan blocked his way he says to the church very honestly
[696.28 → 703.42] like a good pastor I was afraid for you, I was afraid that in my absence the tempter Satan would
[703.42 → 708.66] have tempted you and our work to plant and to preach and to nurture your faith would have been undone
[708.66 → 714.18] and become in vain that's a very honest pastor there he says I was nervous that the same person
[714.18 → 718.84] who's blocking my way from being with you was also undoing the good work of faith in your small
[718.84 → 728.62] young believing community so what does he do Paul can't go back it's probably because his life is
[728.62 → 733.12] that threat like he could be killed for returning he was chased out of the city, and he knows what will
[733.12 → 738.18] happen when he gets back he can't go back this church is young some suggest it's only three or four
[738.18 → 743.60] months old that's a young church they are being tempted by Satan, and they're being persecuted
[743.60 → 751.78] and so what does Paul do he sends timothy, and he sends timothy to strengthen and to encourage their
[751.78 → 756.74] faith as they face all these challenges I want to read for you exactly what Paul says in this letter
[756.74 → 762.36] about timothy's ministry he says we sent timothy who was a brother and co-worker in god's service and
[762.36 → 767.46] spreading the gospel of Christ to strengthen and encourage you in your faith so that no one would
[767.46 → 774.64] be unsettled by these trials you know quite well that we are destined for them in fact when we were
[774.64 → 780.68] with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted and Paul says nonchalantly it turns out
[780.68 → 786.88] that way as you well know there's a lot to tease out in this passage and the first thing I want to say
[786.88 → 792.14] is it seems to me that timothy's ministry of encouraging and strengthening is a ministry for the
[792.14 → 798.18] church to suffer well that's basically what he gets sent there to do encourage them as they face all
[798.18 → 805.34] these trials to face them faithfully and to deal with the consequences and I don't know about you but
[805.34 → 810.76] I think whenever we bump into a passage on suffering and persecution and trials as western believers we
[810.76 → 817.16] need to pause and say what is the spirit saying to us because we don't live in exactly this kind of
[817.16 → 822.74] setting, and we need to have it unearth some stuff in us and one of the things I think it needs to
[822.74 → 829.34] unearth is the way we preach and evangelize and disciple people for example oftentimes when we're
[829.34 → 836.24] sharing the gospel to people we say god loves you which is 100 true we say god has a plan for you
[836.24 → 843.00] which is a 100 true praise the lord but somehow in the west we translate that when we hear it to say
[843.00 → 851.94] god has a comfortable plan for my future god has a safe vision for where he's taking me it's going
[851.94 → 859.46] to be materially, materially prosperous none of that is true for the church of first Thessalonians
[859.46 → 863.80] this is not an easy plan to be part of in fact I think a lot of us would be like you know what
[863.80 → 871.26] I'm not sure I'm up for something so dangerous and insecure and unsafe and yet Paul sends timothy
[871.26 → 878.60] say stand firm church don't give up the faith and timothy and Paul as well as leaders today know
[878.60 → 883.34] there's two very strong temptations for the church whenever there are trials and persecution and pressure
[883.34 → 888.88] one is to give up and say it's not worth it just go with the flow go with what the Romans are doing
[888.88 → 897.40] and avoid all the persecution and trial the other extreme equally tempting is to run away or just to
[897.40 → 901.66] be sort of an enclave community that no longer communicates with the city you just do your own
[901.66 → 906.34] little thing but in so doing you're no longer salt you're no longer light you're no longer blessing the
[906.34 → 912.96] city that Christ himself has sent you to be in and so Paul sends timothy, and he says stand firm
[912.96 → 921.36] more than that Paul seems to suggest, and we don't want to hear this he says this is what we were
[921.36 → 929.10] destined for seeming to say this is what it means to be church and if you listen to his other letters
[929.10 → 933.20] and you read them you'll see that Paul talks about suffering not once not twice but a lot
[933.20 → 939.60] and he seems to be saying as he writes to a lot of different churches when you come to Jesus Christ
[939.60 → 945.86] you place your allegiance in him, you turn away from the idols of that society, and you believe and give
[945.86 → 951.48] your allegiance to Jesus as lord and his saviour it's going to hurt because you're now going against
[951.48 → 956.70] the grain of society and for the Thessalonians it was people who saying Caesar is lord and they
[956.70 → 961.74] worshipped him they paid homage to him and the Christians were saying Jesus is lord and Caesar is
[961.74 → 967.14] not, and they suffered for it in different contexts it's going to take a different shape I think for
[967.14 → 974.60] Christians in the west right now it's saying self is not lord money is not lord sex is not lord
[974.60 → 980.76] Jesus is lord and when we run against the grain of those things there can be pain and trials
[980.76 → 986.44] you know just last week I was chatting with my brother-in-law mark he's a professor at regent
[986.44 → 991.72] college, and they were talking in their class about what it means to be kingdom citizens, and they were
[991.72 → 997.12] talking about how they care for the vulnerable they act justice and mercy, and they have really an
[997.12 → 1003.58] ordinary conversation about the basics of following Christ mark had a Chinese student who is from China
[1003.58 → 1010.68] and returning to China after his time at regent raise his hand and say okay if I preach this
[1010.68 → 1017.22] when I get back to China I am going to be considered dangerous the government will be watching the
[1017.22 → 1022.74] government will be listening, and they might very well arrest me for preaching and living this stuff
[1022.74 → 1030.78] it's okay he can cry so this Chinese student says what do I do if I go back to China and if I preach
[1030.78 → 1035.62] and live this stuff I could get arrested by the government what do I do now if you were the
[1035.62 → 1044.20] professor what would you say what would you be your instruction to that student and the class had a
[1044.20 → 1051.58] very good and healthy conversation about what it means to be faithful to the gospel uncompromising
[1051.58 → 1057.48] in our obedience to Jesus Christ and yet creative and subversive in whatever culture we find ourselves
[1057.48 → 1065.42] a wise teacher once said to me that Christians should never ever seek out suffering but they
[1065.42 → 1071.80] should never be surprised when it comes and the global church the witness of Christians around the
[1071.80 → 1077.16] world which Marie thank you for praying for they bear witness to the reality that as Christians
[1077.16 → 1085.02] lean into Christ they are faithful to the gospel there is suffering there are trials there is resistance
[1085.02 → 1089.52] that requires the church to receive the encouragement from leaders and from the encouragement of the
[1089.52 → 1094.32] spirit to say stand firm this is what it means to be faithful to Jesus Christ
[1094.32 → 1100.98] so what does Paul put before them by way of encouragement well he says he sends timothy to
[1100.98 → 1105.00] tell him to stand firm but what he does over and over in Thessalonians and this is why we named our
[1105.00 → 1110.24] series living in hope is he casts their eyes beyond the present to see what's coming in the future
[1110.24 → 1115.88] he helps him see beyond the present trials to the future hope and I want to turn your attention to
[1115.88 → 1123.18] my favourite part of this passage and that is in verse 219 this is what Paul says for what is our hope
[1123.18 → 1130.82] our joy our crown in which we will glory in the presence of our lord Jesus Christ when he comes is it not
[1130.82 → 1139.02] you indeed you are our glory and our joy now that's a beautiful passage to us but given our context we
[1139.02 → 1143.90] probably miss one of the quickest associations that first century hearers would have when Paul
[1143.90 → 1152.56] mentions crown guess what he's referencing the Olympics obviously the Olympics go way before our
[1152.56 → 1157.48] time and yes they already practiced then and here's how it worked in the first century when a person of
[1157.48 → 1163.28] power and a dignitary would come into the city oftentimes that city would hold Olympics in their honour
[1163.28 → 1168.30] they would have the stadium was full they'd have all sorts of competitions and performances and racing and
[1168.30 → 1173.50] all the rest and then when a person would win an event they would get a crown or a wreath put on
[1173.50 → 1180.16] their head, and they would celebrate in the presence of that dignitary you picture that now don't miss
[1180.16 → 1187.18] what Paul is saying Paul is saying church when Jesus the great dignitary comes in glory and power and
[1187.18 → 1194.78] sits down as the king the great king I am going to boast in his presence and you church will be my crown
[1194.78 → 1200.68] you're the reason I celebrate because my work is not in vain and the gospel has power because the church
[1200.68 → 1212.54] is there hmm can you imagine pastor SID in the presence of Jesus Christ with the crown called hope
[1212.54 → 1224.76] Paul has more to say about hope for the church not just that they can look forward to the future and
[1224.76 → 1228.98] know that Paul is going to celebrate because of their existence but Paul says to them, you will share in
[1228.98 → 1235.06] that glory when Jesus returns to eradicate sin eradicate corruption put an end to suffering and
[1235.06 → 1243.10] vindicate and celebrate he will enable those believers to share in his glory in fact nowhere
[1243.10 → 1250.22] does Paul say it better than in Romans 8 17 where he says I consider the present suffering not worth
[1250.22 → 1255.40] comparing to the future glory that will come and be revealed in the children of god when Jesus returns in
[1255.40 → 1260.64] power think about that the present suffering Christians in that context were likely dying
[1260.64 → 1265.58] for their faith and Paul says this isn't worth comparing to the future glory that is coming
[1265.58 → 1273.70] and so church lift your eyes says Paul and fix your eyes on what is to come wait patiently for that day
[1273.70 → 1281.04] when Jesus will return and reveal his glory reveal his kingship to every ruler of the world eradicate all
[1281.04 → 1288.42] evil and sinful corrupt behaviour and allow his children to experience freedom finally forever
[1288.42 → 1298.02] and until that time the church is given the spirit they're given the power and the comfort and the
[1298.02 → 1304.08] guidance of the spirit they're given leaders who encourage and strengthen and support as they wait
[1304.08 → 1310.56] and live faithfully and Paul finishes by just giving thanks that that's exactly what's happening in this
[1310.56 → 1316.98] church timothy comes back to Paul, and he says Paul it's happening they're standing firm they're not
[1316.98 → 1321.32] giving up on the faith they're not collapsing under pressure they're not hating one another living in
[1321.32 → 1327.22] love they're living faithfully what they believe about Jesus give thanks and so Paul ends with this
[1327.22 → 1333.56] incredibly thankful note saying we cannot stop giving thanks you filled us with joy, and you prove that the
[1333.56 → 1340.82] gospel has power that's our passage in a nutshell so I want to ask that we've been
[1340.82 → 1346.52] asking throughout this series what does Christ say to the church today here in Clayton heights as we
[1346.52 → 1354.84] listen to what he says to the church in first Thessalonians in the first century the first thing that hits me and i
[1354.84 → 1358.54] realize I have certain lenses because I'm a leader in the church but the first thing that hits me
[1358.54 → 1365.42] is that critical role of strengthening and encouraging in the church the ministry of timothy
[1365.42 → 1373.10] the ministry of all leaders in the church I think we can overcomplicate discipleship in the church and
[1373.10 → 1376.96] there's a lot of confusion about what exactly it means and what exactly it looks like to disciple
[1376.96 → 1380.84] but when I read first Thessalonians it actually feels really clear and simple to me
[1380.84 → 1384.80] it's leaders like Paul and then later timothy as Paul goes to other churches
[1384.80 → 1393.36] simply coming alongside young believers encouraging them teaching them caring for them praying for them
[1393.36 → 1398.08] and in so doing watching them grow in their faith in fact you see Paul right at the beginning of
[1398.08 → 1404.08] Thessalonians saying just imitate us follow our example as we follow Christ Paul did not think he
[1404.08 → 1408.70] was perfect, but he knew that he was following Christ and actively seeking to be faithful, and he says to the
[1408.70 → 1414.90] young people just watch my example and I think leaders in the church need to say okay our calling
[1414.90 → 1420.38] is to come alongside young believers and encourage them strengthen them
[1420.38 → 1427.96] I can't also help but see some connections between first Thessalonians and our own today
[1427.96 → 1433.28] in terms of distance you know Paul is lamenting the fact that he can't be with the church
[1433.28 → 1437.22] that they are there he's in Athens he wants to be with them, but they're at a distance
[1437.22 → 1440.62] he's experiencing social isolation before we gave it that category
[1440.62 → 1448.58] I think also one of the pains that we feel is that separation and the distance from one another
[1448.58 → 1453.08] and some of the difficulty that comes from it covid has not been an easy season for the church it's
[1453.08 → 1457.46] been a difficult season for a lot of people, but it's hard for churches and everything I've read on covid
[1457.46 → 1463.58] suggests that whatever you were struggling with before covid is now a lot harder in this in
[1463.58 → 1469.22] in the midst of covid for example if you were struggling with your work it's probably a lot
[1469.22 → 1475.88] harder now or if your marriage was experiencing tension before covid it's probably having a lot
[1475.88 → 1483.86] of difficulty now if you were struggling with addiction before covid it's probably so hard now
[1483.86 → 1490.16] or if you were facing loneliness before covid you have experienced much deeper levels of pain and
[1490.16 → 1498.72] loneliness now does that sound about right and if all that is true that ministry of strengthening and
[1498.72 → 1506.16] encouraging is all the more important now and I speak on behalf of the pastors and the staff here
[1506.16 → 1513.10] when I say this is a time when we need people who are mature and seasoned in their faith to come
[1513.10 → 1522.14] alongside those who need that encouragement and support people who can just simply say how can I pray for
[1522.14 → 1528.40] you how can I care for you how can I speak into the pain and the trials that you are facing so that you can
[1528.40 → 1536.66] stand firm, and we can stand firm in the midst of these specific trials and no trials are not the same as
[1536.66 → 1542.38] first Thessalonians, but we are facing trials, and we need people to come around us and support and
[1542.38 → 1547.46] strengthen our faith so we can live faithfully in the midst of those and one of the things I love about
[1547.46 → 1553.82] our church is that we've actually been given a good mix of seasoned believers and new believers young
[1553.82 → 1560.04] believers old believers, and we're well positioned in my estimation to have this kind of informal discipleship
[1560.04 → 1566.24] happen don't you think and one of the things I'd love for you to do today right now this week
[1566.24 → 1574.96] is prayed lord who are the people that I can strengthen and encourage who are the people in my life that I can
[1574.96 → 1579.76] really come alongside and who are the people I can just receive it from and just so you know it takes a
[1579.76 → 1585.08] little bit of humility to receive that care and say yes I want to be strengthened I need to be encouraged
[1585.08 → 1592.08] in this specific trial receive the care and this by the way goes from our oldest members to our youngest
[1592.08 → 1597.74] children youth young adults there are people that you can encourage and equip and even right now I see
[1597.74 → 1602.86] some of our youth leaders and I give thanks for the way you're investing in youth and children who have
[1602.86 → 1609.54] their own set of trials, but we need this kind of discipleship in order to be faithful in this particular season
[1609.54 → 1621.00] finally let me simply say that we too need to lift our eyes I think the church and generally people in
[1621.00 → 1627.30] the west we can be so myopically preoccupied with the present we're living with our eyes like this
[1627.30 → 1632.04] and Paul over and over again in Thessalonians just says to the church do you know what's coming
[1632.04 → 1639.26] hope do you know what's coming you might feel so frustrated by the elections or whatever social
[1639.26 → 1647.70] ills are right in front of us, but the future is secure when Jesus hung on the cross and rose from
[1647.70 → 1655.54] the grave he sealed what's coming and that coming of Christ gives us confidence, and it gives us hope
[1655.54 → 1661.56] we can face whatever we face today knowing that there is a day when the great dignitary Jesus Christ is
[1661.56 → 1668.04] coming, and he will put an end to corrupt leaders he will put an end to evil the Satan the tempter will be
[1668.04 → 1674.04] eradicated from his good creation and you and I will live in freedom forever you can say amen to that
[1674.04 → 1681.24] that's coming and Paul says live in that hope let's pray
[1681.24 → 1693.86] father we start by giving thanks that you are with us, and we give thanks for the church around the world
[1693.86 → 1699.10] that bears witness to the reign of Jesus in so many different cultures facing so many different
[1699.10 → 1707.10] trials and lord this morning we want to ask that we would learn how to encourage and strengthen the
[1707.10 → 1715.28] faith of our brothers and sisters in faith we pray that even in our local church we would learn how to
[1715.28 → 1724.50] nurture and pray and encourage the faith of those younger than us lord I pray that we would stand firm
[1724.50 → 1730.42] in the faith that the gospel would not just be an idea, but it would be the whole of our lives
[1730.42 → 1738.56] for that to happen lord we need your spirit would you pour your spirit out on us would you encourage
[1738.56 → 1744.94] us to face the challenges we have right in front of us this week with confidence that the grave is
[1744.94 → 1752.82] empty and with hope that you're coming and when that day comes we will celebrate we will be full of joy
[1752.82 → 1758.82] and we will glory in your presence thank you lord that your work is finished and thank you that you're
[1758.82 → 1760.42] coming again amen
[1760.42 → 1786.62] I want you to know
[1786.62 → 1787.58] for
