[1212.62 → 1224.18] As we continue to worship and pray,
[1224.72 → 1227.66] I want to invite everyone who's joining us
[1227.66 → 1230.54] to find a place where you can pray.
[1230.54 → 1235.54] I encourage you not to get too comfortable laying back on your couches and whatnot,
[1235.54 → 1239.54] but to try to find a place and a posture where you can join
[1239.54 → 1242.54] and hear the still small voice of God.
[1242.54 → 1244.54] And we can cry out to Him as well.
[1244.54 → 1248.54] And so at this time, I would like to share a prayer topic.
[1248.54 → 1250.54] I'll lead us in prayer.
[1250.54 → 1252.54] And as the worship band is playing,
[1252.54 → 1255.54] I would invite you guys to, everyone joining us,
[1255.54 → 1258.54] to pray with us in your homes.
[1258.54 → 1260.54] So let me lead us in prayer.
[1260.54 → 1264.54] And with the same topic, I would invite you again to pray in your homes.
[1265.54 → 1268.54] As we read in Psalm 131,
[1268.54 → 1273.54] we acknowledge that we put our trust in our Lord, our God,
[1273.54 → 1278.54] that we do not concern ourselves with things too wonderful for us,
[1278.54 → 1280.54] things that we cannot handle.
[1280.54 → 1284.54] There are so many things that we feel like we can do ourselves
[1284.54 → 1286.54] and we attempt to.
[1286.54 → 1290.54] We attempt to take control of everything that we may face in our lives.
[1290.54 → 1295.54] But at this time, I invite you to lay it all down before the Lord.
[1295.54 → 1300.54] Whatever we may face, the Lord has good plan for those He has called.
[1300.54 → 1303.54] And so let me lead us in prayer.
[1303.54 → 1305.54] And we will pray together.
[1305.54 → 1307.54] Let's pray.
[1310.54 → 1316.54] Lord, we confess that you are bigger than anything that we may face.
[1316.54 → 1322.54] We depend on you, and we trust that you have good plan for those that you have called.
[1322.54 → 1331.54] Specifically, Lord, I pray that you will guide our health workers as they continue to work to bring safety and health for us.
[1331.54 → 1337.54] I pray for those who are currently suffering because of this virus.
[1337.54 → 1339.54] I pray for continual guidance and comfort.
[1339.54 → 1341.54] Lord, heal our land.
[1341.54 → 1353.54] Help us to trust in what you have planned, even when we can't understand it.
[1353.54 → 1355.54] Even when we can't see it.
[1355.54 → 1357.54] Lord, help us to trust in you.
[1357.54 → 1359.54] So we pray to you, Lord.
[1359.54 → 1361.54] We cry out to you.
[1361.54 → 1363.54] We depend on you.
[1363.54 → 1366.54] So let's pray together.
[1366.54 → 1385.54] Let's pray together.
