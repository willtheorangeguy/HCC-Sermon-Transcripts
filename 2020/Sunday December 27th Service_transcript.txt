[0.00 --> 9.76]  Well, we're going to have a very 2020 moment.
[9.90 --> 11.42]  I was told my microphone wasn't on,
[11.50 --> 13.32]  and so I'm just going to say hello again.
[13.48 --> 14.34]  Let's do a do-over.
[15.46 --> 17.54]  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to everyone.
[17.78 --> 19.30]  It is good to be together in worship
[19.30 --> 21.06]  on this final Sunday of the year.
[21.50 --> 22.48]  I know for many of us,
[22.54 --> 24.48]  we're just ready for 2020 to be finished.
[24.88 --> 27.04]  We feel like it's been a bit of a gong show
[27.04 --> 28.08]  inside of a train wreck,
[28.08 --> 29.16]  inside of a dumpster fire,
[29.16 --> 31.72]  and we just want to turn the page and go to 2021.
[32.82 --> 34.48]  But I think it's important for us to stop
[34.48 --> 36.36]  and to reflect and to even give thanks
[36.36 --> 38.04]  for what God has been up to this year,
[38.24 --> 39.98]  for how he's been faithful to the church
[39.98 --> 41.42]  and to his world in this year,
[41.50 --> 43.60]  and this service really is going to be about stopping,
[44.10 --> 45.48]  reflecting, and giving thanks.
[46.68 --> 49.82]  I want us to start with a song, or really a prayer.
[50.12 --> 52.48]  This is a prayer of Moses, so this goes back,
[52.96 --> 55.68]  and this is a well-known psalm on the brevity of life,
[55.68 --> 57.58]  on the everlasting character of the Father,
[57.58 --> 60.48]  and a prayer for God to make our work last.
[61.90 --> 64.98]  Lord, you've been our dwelling place throughout all generations.
[65.74 --> 67.44]  Before the mountains were born,
[67.54 --> 69.74]  or you brought forth the whole world,
[70.02 --> 71.90]  from everlasting to everlasting,
[72.46 --> 73.52]  you are God.
[74.18 --> 75.74]  You turn people back to dust,
[75.86 --> 77.66]  saying, return to dust, you mortals.
[78.54 --> 80.26]  A thousand years in your sight
[80.26 --> 82.54]  are like a day that has just gone by,
[82.86 --> 84.58]  or like a watch in the night.
[84.58 --> 87.46]  Yet you sweep people away in the sleep of death.
[88.14 --> 90.30]  They are like the new grass of the morning.
[90.84 --> 92.24]  In the morning it springs up new,
[92.32 --> 94.28]  but by evening it is dry and withered.
[95.02 --> 95.78]  And now the prayer.
[96.76 --> 100.48]  May the favor of the Lord our God rest on us.
[101.12 --> 103.02]  Establish the work of our hands.
[103.74 --> 106.98]  Yes, establish the work of our hands.
[107.64 --> 109.04]  Would you join me in an opening prayer?
[109.04 --> 115.40]  Father, as we enter into worship on this final Sunday of the year,
[116.20 --> 118.52]  we ask that you would be present to us.
[119.48 --> 121.96]  As we've just read in this psalm, Lord,
[122.50 --> 123.78]  our days are fleeting.
[124.70 --> 125.60]  They are short.
[126.20 --> 127.84]  They are like the grass of the morning
[127.84 --> 129.18]  that withers in the evening.
[129.32 --> 130.16]  And we pray, Lord,
[130.22 --> 131.62]  that you would help us see
[131.62 --> 133.68]  the brevity of our lives.
[134.74 --> 136.54]  And in light of its brevity, Lord,
[136.54 --> 139.60]  we pray that we would know how to make our lives matter.
[140.20 --> 141.86]  To prioritize our time,
[142.60 --> 143.34]  our habits,
[144.16 --> 145.62]  the ambitions of our life
[145.62 --> 147.14]  such that they honor you,
[147.84 --> 149.06]  they build your kingdom,
[149.52 --> 150.60]  and they are a blessing.
[151.74 --> 153.74]  Lord, we pray at the end of this year
[153.74 --> 156.68]  that you would establish the work of our hands.
[157.10 --> 158.42]  And that we as a community
[158.42 --> 159.44]  would be a blessing.
[160.24 --> 162.08]  We pray this in the name of Jesus Christ.
[162.82 --> 163.12]  Amen.
[163.12 --> 165.10]  In your homes,
[165.18 --> 166.94]  we invite you to stand and worship with us
[166.94 --> 167.56]  as we sing,
[167.70 --> 168.36]  Bless the Lord.
[174.32 --> 176.04]  It's become a bit of tradition for us
[176.04 --> 177.62]  to finish our year each year
[177.62 --> 179.74]  with a reflection on the season,
[179.86 --> 181.46]  on the ministry of the year before.
[181.62 --> 183.86]  And so I'm going to do a year in review this morning.
[184.50 --> 185.58]  But before I do that,
[185.62 --> 187.44]  I just want to encourage you as families,
[187.76 --> 189.40]  if you have time today
[189.40 --> 190.72]  or even in the following week,
[190.72 --> 192.76]  to spend time asking the question,
[193.20 --> 195.38]  what were the memorable moments of 2020?
[196.60 --> 197.54]  What were the things
[197.54 --> 199.40]  where you heard God teaching you
[199.40 --> 200.32]  about life,
[200.42 --> 200.90]  its brevity,
[201.04 --> 201.58]  about health,
[201.70 --> 203.14]  about anything that could have come up
[203.14 --> 203.74]  in this year?
[204.34 --> 205.20]  And what are the things
[205.20 --> 206.56]  that you give thanks for
[206.56 --> 208.26]  that you don't want to forget
[208.26 --> 209.28]  about 2020?
[209.48 --> 210.92]  Spend time in that conversation
[210.92 --> 212.96]  around the lunch or dinner table
[212.96 --> 213.80]  this week.
[213.80 --> 217.76]  The very first service of 2020,
[218.24 --> 221.06]  we started a series on Sabbath.
[221.78 --> 223.90]  We preached on how to slow down
[223.90 --> 224.88]  and we made a commitment
[224.88 --> 227.32]  to not starting any new ministries in 2020.
[227.74 --> 230.10]  And then you got a 10-month Sabbath.
[231.06 --> 233.12]  We got to practice what we preached.
[234.56 --> 236.62]  On February 25,
[237.32 --> 240.32]  we participated in the last big event of the year.
[240.46 --> 240.94]  That's right.
[240.94 --> 242.94]  The coldest night of the year walk.
[243.46 --> 245.48]  And in true hope competitive fashion,
[245.64 --> 247.18]  we were the top fundraising church
[247.18 --> 250.18]  and we beat Pacific Community Church again.
[250.58 --> 251.42]  If you're listening to this,
[251.48 --> 252.24]  Dave Glass-Stetter,
[252.74 --> 253.30]  we won,
[253.40 --> 254.96]  but we'll see you in a month and a half.
[255.66 --> 257.10]  We raised over $11,000
[257.10 --> 259.24]  and three of the top five fundraisers
[259.24 --> 261.42]  were children and youth from our church
[261.42 --> 263.86]  and I was very proud of us in that day.
[264.96 --> 266.84]  One of the ministries that never stopped
[266.84 --> 267.74]  throughout 2025
[267.74 --> 270.00]  was our work at the Cloverdale Community Kitchen.
[270.00 --> 272.70]  Our group of dedicated volunteers served,
[272.78 --> 273.78]  if my math is correct,
[273.88 --> 277.66]  served and shared 1,560 meals
[277.66 --> 280.38]  with our neighbors who are vulnerable
[280.38 --> 281.64]  and live on the margins
[281.64 --> 282.90]  and we give thanks for that.
[283.52 --> 284.34]  Even in the fall,
[284.76 --> 286.30]  we were one of the few drop-off zones
[286.30 --> 287.64]  or drop-off centers
[287.64 --> 288.96]  in the whole lower mainland
[288.96 --> 290.02]  and we just thought,
[290.14 --> 290.74]  if we're the church,
[290.88 --> 293.00]  we're going to receive donations
[293.00 --> 294.54]  and food for our neighbors
[294.54 --> 295.90]  and I was grateful for the way
[295.90 --> 297.86]  that donations poured in from the city
[297.86 --> 298.86]  for our neighbors.
[301.32 --> 302.48]  We continued to partner
[302.48 --> 304.20]  with Adams Road Elementary School
[304.20 --> 306.34]  and sponsored their breakfast program
[306.34 --> 307.44]  for children who were not able
[307.44 --> 308.62]  to come to school with food
[308.62 --> 310.52]  and we just received another letter
[310.52 --> 311.40]  from them thanking us
[311.40 --> 312.38]  for the way that we continue
[312.38 --> 313.32]  to support them
[313.32 --> 315.20]  and surround them in this kind of care
[315.20 --> 316.18]  in this season.
[317.32 --> 318.68]  This year, we welcomed babies,
[319.10 --> 321.42]  Hayden, Paige, Lucy, and Nathan,
[321.68 --> 323.78]  two of whom I still have not seen.
[324.64 --> 327.18]  We baptized Sophia, Isabella, and Lucy
[327.18 --> 328.44]  and this picture here
[328.44 --> 329.30]  will always remind me
[329.30 --> 330.16]  of the strangeness
[330.16 --> 332.22]  of doing a baptism with a mask.
[332.36 --> 332.96]  Who would have thought
[332.96 --> 334.00]  that that would be the case?
[335.46 --> 336.98]  We celebrated marriage.
[337.36 --> 338.46]  Doug and Debbie,
[339.22 --> 340.20]  Steve and Megan.
[340.32 --> 342.02]  In fact, Steve and Megan's wedding
[342.02 --> 343.22]  was my first COVID wedding
[343.22 --> 344.44]  and we even had a special guest.
[344.82 --> 346.64]  The police show up to celebrate
[346.64 --> 347.82]  because there were not one
[347.82 --> 350.10]  but two social distancing complaints
[350.10 --> 351.40]  and that's when we realized
[351.40 --> 352.80]  this is a different kind of year
[352.80 --> 354.48]  with different kind of weddings.
[356.34 --> 357.98]  We grieved this year.
[358.62 --> 360.50]  Many of us lost loved ones,
[360.80 --> 361.50]  some to COVID.
[361.98 --> 363.84]  I know Estelle lost two relatives
[363.84 --> 364.74]  to COVID
[364.74 --> 366.02]  and we recognized
[366.02 --> 367.14]  that it was a difficult year
[367.14 --> 367.50]  of grieving,
[367.62 --> 368.50]  not just loss
[368.50 --> 370.30]  but also grieving in small numbers
[370.30 --> 371.44]  and not being able to gather
[371.44 --> 372.72]  and hug and be together
[372.72 --> 374.84]  in the way that we would normally grieve.
[376.38 --> 377.68]  On March 14,
[378.40 --> 381.24]  our gatherings were officially shut down
[381.24 --> 382.56]  and I remember arguing
[382.56 --> 383.56]  with our elders saying,
[383.70 --> 384.12]  no, no, no,
[384.12 --> 385.46]  we can still gather,
[385.58 --> 386.50]  this should be okay
[386.50 --> 387.40]  only to realize,
[387.50 --> 388.26]  no, this is serious.
[388.86 --> 390.68]  We did our very first online service
[390.68 --> 391.74]  on March 14
[391.74 --> 393.12]  and I remember being so grateful
[393.12 --> 394.12]  for the media team
[394.12 --> 395.22]  who stepped up
[395.22 --> 397.70]  and did such good work
[397.70 --> 398.88]  making worship happen
[398.88 --> 399.48]  in our homes
[399.48 --> 400.50]  in the way that it has.
[400.96 --> 401.94]  Our gifted media team
[401.94 --> 402.90]  has risen to the challenge.
[402.98 --> 403.82]  I just want to say thank you
[403.82 --> 404.28]  to Greg,
[404.68 --> 405.30]  to Joel,
[405.60 --> 406.22]  to John,
[406.46 --> 407.00]  to David,
[407.30 --> 407.78]  to Vince,
[407.98 --> 409.04]  and to Dave Herod.
[409.04 --> 410.36]  You have been such a gift.
[410.44 --> 411.00]  There's a picture
[411.00 --> 412.30]  of our media team.
[412.36 --> 413.00]  I think that was during
[413.00 --> 414.50]  one of our very first live streams
[414.50 --> 415.80]  and they wanted to build
[415.80 --> 417.04]  the number of views we had.
[417.10 --> 418.12]  You could see all their devices
[418.12 --> 418.82]  open there.
[419.26 --> 420.24]  It was wonderful.
[420.62 --> 421.76]  I think we had four views
[421.76 --> 422.54]  for that service.
[424.26 --> 426.40]  We learned how to do ministry
[426.40 --> 428.26]  without a building this year
[428.26 --> 430.70]  and I think that's a good thing.
[430.82 --> 431.98]  There's our youth leaders
[431.98 --> 432.94]  meeting over Zoom.
[433.40 --> 434.58]  So many pictures I have
[434.58 --> 435.10]  from this year
[435.10 --> 437.48]  are pictures of people on Zoom
[437.48 --> 439.28]  and of course the phrase
[439.28 --> 440.24]  of 2020 is
[440.24 --> 441.30]  you're on mute.
[442.20 --> 442.98]  We can't hear you
[442.98 --> 443.80]  just like how we started
[443.80 --> 444.40]  this service.
[445.68 --> 446.50]  There's another picture
[446.50 --> 447.30]  I want to show you though.
[447.40 --> 448.52]  That's our worship team.
[448.84 --> 449.88]  Our team's all leading
[449.88 --> 450.60]  from their homes
[450.60 --> 451.60]  doing a collaborative video.
[451.68 --> 452.80]  That video is such a blessing
[452.80 --> 453.50]  and in fact you're going
[453.50 --> 454.02]  to hear that one
[454.02 --> 454.92]  at the end of the service
[454.92 --> 455.50]  this morning.
[456.00 --> 456.68]  But the next picture
[456.68 --> 457.48]  you'll see are youth
[457.48 --> 458.94]  doing their small group meeting
[458.94 --> 459.68]  on the lawn,
[460.02 --> 461.08]  I believe.
[463.66 --> 464.32]  There they are.
[464.38 --> 465.36]  That picture I love
[465.36 --> 466.28]  because if you don't know
[466.28 --> 466.90]  the history of hope,
[466.90 --> 468.00]  there's actually another picture
[468.00 --> 469.08]  we have of young adults
[469.08 --> 470.44]  before the church was built
[470.44 --> 471.40]  doing their small group
[471.40 --> 472.32]  and a time of prayer
[472.32 --> 473.06]  on the property
[473.06 --> 474.42]  and there's something so cool
[474.42 --> 475.20]  about seeing our youth
[475.20 --> 476.28]  on the property again
[476.28 --> 477.44]  doing Bible study,
[477.92 --> 478.58]  praying together,
[478.74 --> 479.86]  recognizing that the ministry
[479.86 --> 480.84]  doesn't have to be
[480.84 --> 481.98]  in a building.
[482.12 --> 482.78]  And I think 2020
[482.78 --> 483.66]  was a year of learning
[483.66 --> 484.36]  how to do ministry
[484.36 --> 485.44]  without the building
[485.44 --> 486.02]  and there's something
[486.02 --> 487.02]  so good and right
[487.02 --> 487.68]  about that.
[489.18 --> 490.04]  And then of course
[490.04 --> 490.76]  we learned how to do
[490.76 --> 491.64]  worship in the building
[491.64 --> 492.44]  in limited numbers
[492.44 --> 493.44]  with fog machines
[493.44 --> 494.96]  and masks
[494.96 --> 496.16]  and distancing
[496.16 --> 498.30]  and seating capacity limits
[498.30 --> 499.44]  and tracking
[499.44 --> 500.92]  and no childcare.
[501.62 --> 503.32]  What a unique season
[503.32 --> 504.16]  that was too.
[504.22 --> 505.00]  And there's just a picture
[505.00 --> 506.08]  of what worship looked like
[506.08 --> 507.26]  for several months
[507.26 --> 508.16]  when we could still gather
[508.16 --> 509.30]  in two groups of 50
[509.30 --> 510.80]  at 9 and 11.
[513.18 --> 514.32]  We had to cancel
[514.32 --> 516.00]  a lot of events.
[517.26 --> 518.12]  The community barbecue
[518.12 --> 518.98]  with our neighbors,
[519.86 --> 520.60]  Christmas parties,
[521.18 --> 522.28]  the cornerstone play
[522.28 --> 522.92]  for the neighborhood,
[523.18 --> 524.18]  seniors dinners,
[524.62 --> 525.46]  Clayton days,
[525.92 --> 526.60]  Tot Romp,
[526.92 --> 527.40]  Pickleball,
[527.58 --> 528.62]  all things that really
[528.62 --> 529.96]  gathered people together
[529.96 --> 530.96]  we canceled.
[531.10 --> 532.08]  And I just want to say
[532.08 --> 533.50]  that was very hard
[533.50 --> 535.00]  for us ministry leaders
[535.00 --> 536.14]  who invested in these
[536.14 --> 537.20]  a way that we just
[537.20 --> 537.94]  naturally connect
[537.94 --> 538.40]  to our neighborhood.
[538.58 --> 539.84]  It was hard for us
[539.84 --> 540.54]  on those moments,
[540.66 --> 541.48]  those days where we knew
[541.48 --> 542.82]  every year this is what we do,
[542.92 --> 543.68]  this is the event
[543.68 --> 544.30]  that we host.
[544.56 --> 545.86]  It was hard to not have
[545.86 --> 546.82]  those happen this year.
[548.08 --> 550.12]  But instead of big gatherings
[550.12 --> 551.32]  with lots of people,
[551.62 --> 553.54]  we had so many small
[553.54 --> 555.60]  creative gatherings happening.
[556.34 --> 557.28]  Small groups meeting
[557.28 --> 559.00]  over Zoom or in garages.
[559.86 --> 560.90]  Deacons dropping up
[560.90 --> 562.34]  so many different gifts
[562.34 --> 563.10]  to so many different
[563.10 --> 563.78]  groups of people.
[564.30 --> 565.04]  Groups of people
[565.04 --> 566.16]  just organizing
[566.16 --> 567.28]  very voluntarily
[567.28 --> 568.28]  to drop off cups
[568.28 --> 568.92]  and mugs
[568.92 --> 570.28]  and gifts at front steps.
[570.52 --> 571.38]  We saw so much
[571.38 --> 572.58]  creative care happening.
[572.92 --> 573.46]  And I don't think
[573.46 --> 574.50]  our deacons have ever
[574.50 --> 575.82]  called more people
[575.82 --> 577.88]  than they have this year
[577.88 --> 578.18]  to say,
[578.26 --> 578.86]  how are you doing?
[579.56 --> 580.60]  How can we care for you?
[580.96 --> 581.64]  What are the needs
[581.64 --> 582.58]  that we can pray for?
[583.04 --> 584.28]  And I was so encouraged
[584.28 --> 585.64]  to see that creative,
[586.08 --> 587.12]  very personal care
[587.12 --> 588.18]  happen throughout 2020.
[588.56 --> 589.60]  And I think we can learn
[589.60 --> 590.48]  that that honestly
[590.48 --> 591.78]  is how ministry needs
[591.78 --> 592.38]  to remain
[592.38 --> 593.64]  in so many ways.
[595.34 --> 596.48]  We said goodbye
[596.48 --> 597.50]  to a number of people
[597.50 --> 597.94]  this year.
[598.50 --> 599.44]  Michael and Morgan,
[600.12 --> 601.12]  Laura and John,
[601.76 --> 602.74]  Dylan and Hannah,
[603.60 --> 604.78]  Grace, Megan,
[605.28 --> 605.60]  Amy,
[606.14 --> 607.18]  Jin and Xianghee.
[607.18 --> 608.80]  And so many of these
[608.80 --> 609.46]  goodbyes, of course,
[609.52 --> 610.28]  were good goodbyes
[610.28 --> 611.26]  where God was sending
[611.26 --> 612.38]  our brothers and sisters
[612.38 --> 613.04]  to different parts
[613.04 --> 613.50]  of the world,
[613.60 --> 614.10]  to Malaysia,
[614.36 --> 614.80]  Indonesia,
[615.04 --> 615.56]  Mongolia,
[615.74 --> 616.16]  and soon,
[616.32 --> 616.76]  Lord willing,
[616.86 --> 617.66]  the South Sudan.
[618.22 --> 618.96]  And I believe,
[619.10 --> 619.90]  I really do believe
[619.90 --> 620.70]  that it's God's way
[620.70 --> 621.88]  of connecting our church
[621.88 --> 623.26]  to His global church
[623.26 --> 624.16]  and helping our church
[624.16 --> 625.20]  see the wider
[625.20 --> 626.96]  global mission of God
[626.96 --> 628.36]  and how we can partner
[628.36 --> 629.28]  with those we know
[629.28 --> 629.74]  and love
[629.74 --> 630.32]  who are part of
[630.32 --> 631.04]  our own community
[631.04 --> 632.70]  as they continue ministry
[632.70 --> 633.42]  in different parts
[633.42 --> 634.00]  of the world.
[634.00 --> 636.92]  On September,
[637.78 --> 638.56]  September 3,
[638.66 --> 639.12]  I believe,
[639.64 --> 641.72]  we sealed our pastoral intern,
[641.92 --> 642.82]  Jonathan Huang,
[643.28 --> 645.54]  and we gratefully received him
[645.54 --> 646.36]  and Moon and Joseph
[646.36 --> 647.38]  into our church family.
[647.78 --> 648.58]  And Jonathan is actually
[648.58 --> 649.34]  preaching this morning
[649.34 --> 650.24]  and we just give thanks
[650.24 --> 651.28]  for the gift he's been
[651.28 --> 652.32]  in this season.
[654.72 --> 656.10]  God has been faithful,
[657.26 --> 658.04]  He's been gracious,
[658.72 --> 659.58]  He's been merciful,
[659.82 --> 661.36]  and He has been generous to us.
[662.12 --> 663.06]  And some of the words
[663.06 --> 663.62]  that I would use
[663.62 --> 664.88]  to describe our church
[664.88 --> 665.48]  in this year
[665.48 --> 666.68]  are creative,
[667.66 --> 668.16]  adaptive,
[669.26 --> 670.42]  long-suffering,
[670.74 --> 672.18]  and generous.
[672.76 --> 674.34]  I remember already in May,
[674.66 --> 675.36]  as staff,
[675.46 --> 675.70]  we said,
[675.82 --> 676.40]  we feel called
[676.40 --> 677.80]  to be a generous church.
[678.20 --> 679.64]  And I've really been amazed
[679.64 --> 680.44]  to see how money
[680.44 --> 681.10]  has been given
[681.10 --> 682.08]  and then flowed
[682.08 --> 682.76]  through this church,
[682.84 --> 684.34]  how time has flowed
[684.34 --> 685.10]  from this community
[685.10 --> 686.10]  into the city.
[686.16 --> 686.98]  And I just give thanks
[686.98 --> 687.36]  for the way
[687.36 --> 688.04]  that our posture
[688.04 --> 689.02]  in this season
[689.02 --> 690.68]  has not been that of defeat,
[690.68 --> 692.00]  but that of resilience
[692.00 --> 693.38]  and generosity.
[693.60 --> 694.56]  So thank the Lord.
[695.08 --> 696.10]  This next picture for me
[696.10 --> 697.16]  captures really
[697.16 --> 698.40]  so much of the year.
[698.78 --> 699.62]  My favorite service
[699.62 --> 700.08]  of the year
[700.08 --> 701.20]  was our Easter service
[701.20 --> 702.26]  and we hadn't seen
[702.26 --> 703.08]  each other in months
[703.08 --> 703.88]  and then, of course,
[703.96 --> 705.00]  Dave Herod and Joel
[705.00 --> 705.76]  put together
[705.76 --> 706.56]  this amazing video
[706.56 --> 707.10]  where we just said
[707.10 --> 707.80]  Christ is risen
[707.80 --> 709.20]  and seeing the faces
[709.20 --> 710.38]  of our families
[710.38 --> 710.82]  in the church
[710.82 --> 711.28]  and couples
[711.28 --> 712.74]  just saying Christ is risen
[712.74 --> 713.52]  reminded me
[713.52 --> 714.32]  that the church
[714.32 --> 715.42]  has not shut down.
[716.18 --> 717.10]  The church is still
[717.10 --> 717.90]  the church gathered
[717.90 --> 718.56]  or scattered
[718.56 --> 719.74]  and hope we give
[719.74 --> 720.50]  thanks for you.
[720.68 --> 721.56]  And that we can be
[721.56 --> 722.02]  the church
[722.02 --> 723.06]  in and for Clayton
[723.06 --> 724.06]  in 2020.
[724.26 --> 724.84]  Praise the Lord.
[726.52 --> 727.32]  The final thing
[727.32 --> 727.84]  I want to say
[727.84 --> 728.30]  is the gift
[728.30 --> 728.88]  that Sid and I
[728.88 --> 729.76]  experienced this year
[729.76 --> 731.36]  is the gift of being
[731.36 --> 731.84]  in unity
[731.84 --> 732.54]  with other churches.
[733.44 --> 733.98]  There's been
[733.98 --> 734.88]  monthly Zoom meetings
[734.88 --> 735.44]  that have happened
[735.44 --> 736.46]  among Cloverdale pastors
[736.46 --> 736.94]  that have been
[736.94 --> 737.62]  more essential
[737.62 --> 738.14]  than ever
[738.14 --> 739.12]  where we just
[739.12 --> 739.82]  resource share.
[740.50 --> 741.34]  We lament
[741.34 --> 742.58]  that which we
[742.58 --> 743.66]  were not able to do
[743.66 --> 744.66]  and we say
[744.66 --> 745.30]  how can we pray
[745.30 --> 745.82]  for one another?
[745.94 --> 746.78]  What can we do?
[746.86 --> 747.32]  What are the creative
[747.32 --> 748.02]  things we can do
[748.02 --> 748.90]  to bless our city?
[749.26 --> 749.82]  And we give
[749.82 --> 750.56]  thanks more
[750.56 --> 750.92]  than ever
[750.92 --> 751.52]  for the unity
[751.52 --> 752.06]  of the church
[752.06 --> 752.62]  in Cloverdale
[752.62 --> 753.78]  and for the unified
[753.78 --> 754.82]  voice of the church
[754.82 --> 755.34]  in Cloverdale
[755.34 --> 756.58]  with the ups and downs
[756.58 --> 757.36]  of lockdowns
[757.36 --> 758.12]  and church closers
[758.12 --> 759.12]  and all the rest.
[759.72 --> 760.48]  And so what we've done
[760.48 --> 761.70]  to finish the year off
[761.70 --> 762.32]  is the churches
[762.32 --> 762.92]  of Cloverdale
[762.92 --> 763.46]  have put together
[763.46 --> 763.96]  a video
[763.96 --> 765.06]  and it really is
[765.06 --> 765.70]  a video that gives
[765.70 --> 766.44]  thanks for what
[766.44 --> 766.98]  God has done
[766.98 --> 767.52]  in and through
[767.52 --> 768.02]  the church
[768.02 --> 768.50]  and the city
[768.50 --> 769.02]  this year
[769.02 --> 769.90]  and let's take
[769.90 --> 770.36]  a few moments
[770.36 --> 771.06]  to watch that video
[771.06 --> 771.32]  now.
[771.32 --> 774.56]  Hey everyone
[774.56 --> 776.40]  we know that 2020
[776.40 --> 777.48]  has been a tough year
[777.48 --> 778.50]  for most of us
[778.50 --> 779.28]  relationally
[779.28 --> 779.84]  socially
[779.84 --> 780.92]  with mental health
[780.92 --> 781.94]  and even in our faith
[781.94 --> 783.74]  and we also realize
[783.74 --> 784.38]  though that this has been
[784.38 --> 785.30]  a year of adapting
[785.30 --> 786.80]  of creative care
[786.80 --> 787.74]  and of learning
[787.74 --> 788.70]  to love our neighbors
[788.70 --> 789.34]  in new ways.
[789.84 --> 791.06]  We thought as Cloverdale
[791.06 --> 791.86]  pastors that it would
[791.86 --> 792.62]  be fitting to finish
[792.62 --> 793.60]  our year on the tone
[793.60 --> 794.16]  of gratitude.
[794.86 --> 796.10]  We've seen God work
[796.10 --> 796.76]  in our churches
[796.76 --> 797.56]  this season
[797.56 --> 798.24]  and so for the next
[798.24 --> 798.64]  few minutes
[798.64 --> 799.10]  we're going to share
[799.10 --> 800.62]  stories and share words
[800.62 --> 801.34]  of how we've seen
[801.34 --> 801.80]  God at work
[801.80 --> 802.30]  in our churches
[802.30 --> 803.20]  and through our churches
[803.20 --> 804.44]  in the city at large.
[805.08 --> 806.06]  At the Cloverdale
[806.06 --> 806.78]  Community Kitchen
[806.78 --> 808.52]  we are so thankful
[808.52 --> 809.90]  for all the churches
[809.90 --> 810.68]  that have been involved
[810.68 --> 811.54]  in connecting with
[811.54 --> 812.00]  the community
[812.00 --> 812.88]  over the pandemic.
[813.70 --> 814.58]  March came
[814.58 --> 816.36]  and we weren't sure
[816.36 --> 817.10]  if we were able
[817.10 --> 818.64]  to keep the doors open
[818.64 --> 820.72]  as everybody was scared
[820.72 --> 821.20]  with COVID
[821.20 --> 821.90]  and we didn't know
[821.90 --> 822.62]  what was next
[822.62 --> 824.64]  and a lot of our volunteers
[824.64 --> 826.62]  were 65 and older
[826.62 --> 828.80]  and so a lot of them
[828.80 --> 829.68]  had to call in
[829.68 --> 831.18]  and say I can't serve anymore
[831.18 --> 833.32]  and we put the word out
[833.32 --> 835.30]  we said a lot of our volunteers
[835.30 --> 836.08]  can't serve
[836.08 --> 838.00]  and for every volunteer
[838.00 --> 839.22]  that we lost in March
[839.22 --> 841.58]  two volunteers showed up
[841.58 --> 843.66]  and we now have more volunteers
[843.66 --> 844.90]  serving more meals
[844.90 --> 846.08]  serving more people
[846.08 --> 847.10]  with food in Cloverdale
[847.10 --> 848.14]  than we've ever had.
[848.92 --> 850.56]  Hey one of the surprising
[850.56 --> 852.52]  and gratifying things
[852.52 --> 853.30]  about this year
[853.30 --> 854.40]  has been the way
[854.40 --> 855.12]  in which people
[855.12 --> 856.66]  have just come together
[856.66 --> 857.72]  and learned new ways
[857.72 --> 859.30]  to support and love each other
[859.30 --> 860.64]  new ways to live out
[860.64 --> 861.94]  God's grace and truth
[861.94 --> 863.66]  even in difficult circumstances.
[864.18 --> 865.22]  I suppose we shouldn't
[865.22 --> 865.90]  be surprised
[865.90 --> 867.08]  God's spirit
[867.08 --> 868.06]  has a way of just
[868.06 --> 868.98]  working through
[868.98 --> 870.06]  even the most difficult
[870.06 --> 870.80]  of circumstances
[870.80 --> 872.72]  and I'm just so grateful
[872.72 --> 874.04]  for the way that's turned out.
[874.36 --> 875.24]  I'm looking forward
[875.24 --> 876.68]  to an exciting new year
[876.68 --> 877.70]  and I'm so grateful
[877.70 --> 878.48]  to be able to
[878.48 --> 879.30]  go through it
[879.30 --> 880.02]  with the friends
[880.02 --> 881.36]  that God's given us
[881.36 --> 882.66]  at Port Kellis Church.
[883.90 --> 885.38]  I've been thinking about
[885.38 --> 886.42]  first of all
[886.42 --> 887.28]  I'm just grateful
[887.28 --> 888.06]  that the church
[888.06 --> 889.20]  keeps going
[889.20 --> 891.26]  keeps going through technology
[891.26 --> 891.88]  keeps going through
[891.88 --> 893.32]  a lot of other ways
[893.32 --> 893.82]  a lot of people
[893.82 --> 894.60]  working really hard
[894.60 --> 895.66]  to make us
[895.66 --> 896.94]  still present
[896.94 --> 898.96]  but an example
[898.96 --> 900.04]  that came to my mind
[900.04 --> 902.50]  was we had a meeting
[902.50 --> 903.40]  recently with our
[903.40 --> 904.40]  board of leaders
[904.40 --> 905.56]  and elders
[905.56 --> 908.52]  and it was a budget meeting
[908.52 --> 910.98]  and so we were going to
[910.98 --> 912.40]  talk about the upcoming budget
[912.40 --> 914.26]  and where we're going to go
[914.26 --> 914.98]  with certain things
[914.98 --> 915.76]  and how it's going
[915.76 --> 919.72]  and we ended up
[919.72 --> 921.00]  looking at the budget
[921.00 --> 921.84]  and feeling really grateful
[921.84 --> 923.42]  because people were still giving
[923.42 --> 924.72]  and that's a wonderful thing
[924.72 --> 926.46]  but we talked about
[926.46 --> 927.30]  where we're going to go
[927.30 --> 928.08]  a little bit
[928.08 --> 928.78]  but we didn't spend
[928.78 --> 929.40]  a whole lot of time
[929.40 --> 929.76]  on the budget
[929.76 --> 930.48]  and I think that was
[930.48 --> 931.96]  budgets are worthwhile
[931.96 --> 932.92]  so I'm not saying
[932.92 --> 933.88]  anything against that
[933.88 --> 935.10]  but what struck me
[935.10 --> 936.08]  was we soon turned
[936.08 --> 937.38]  the conversation to
[937.38 --> 940.30]  in this time
[940.30 --> 941.88]  how are we going to connect
[941.88 --> 942.64]  to the community
[942.64 --> 944.54]  I remember when
[944.54 --> 945.52]  we had our first shutdown
[945.52 --> 946.54]  in the spring
[946.54 --> 948.14]  the week after that
[948.14 --> 948.96]  decision was made
[948.96 --> 949.90]  by our local elders
[949.90 --> 951.46]  I got a number of calls
[951.46 --> 952.40]  and emails that week
[952.40 --> 953.76]  and there was no suspicion
[953.76 --> 955.18]  there was no criticism
[955.18 --> 956.62]  they were simply people saying
[956.62 --> 957.04]  hey Dave
[957.04 --> 957.80]  how can I help
[957.80 --> 959.58]  and two people right away said
[959.58 --> 960.80]  Dave where can I give
[960.80 --> 962.08]  where are the needs of our city
[962.08 --> 964.12]  and I remember receiving those calls
[964.12 --> 964.78]  and thinking to myself
[964.78 --> 965.90]  yes this is what it means
[965.90 --> 966.56]  to be the church
[966.56 --> 967.24]  in this city
[967.24 --> 967.96]  and it was a deeply
[967.96 --> 968.74]  encouraging moment
[968.74 --> 969.44]  for me realizing
[969.44 --> 970.58]  how our church was adapting
[970.58 --> 971.28]  to the needs
[971.28 --> 972.20]  of this moment
[972.20 --> 974.40]  I have seen people
[974.40 --> 975.14]  in our churches
[975.14 --> 976.62]  connect with each other
[976.62 --> 977.78]  in greater ways
[977.78 --> 979.16]  to get through
[979.16 --> 980.90]  this pandemic situation
[980.90 --> 982.28]  and also I have seen
[982.28 --> 983.54]  so many Cloverdale churches
[983.54 --> 984.30]  get online
[984.30 --> 985.18]  and on board
[985.18 --> 985.98]  with the Cloverdale
[985.98 --> 986.76]  Community Kitchen
[986.76 --> 988.56]  in serving others
[988.56 --> 989.30]  in the food bank
[989.30 --> 990.26]  and serving meals
[990.26 --> 991.30]  to the marginalized
[991.30 --> 992.78]  in our own community
[992.78 --> 993.62]  and lastly
[993.62 --> 994.28]  I have seen
[994.28 --> 995.42]  so many Christians
[995.42 --> 996.40]  in these churches
[996.40 --> 998.62]  sort of use the pandemic
[998.62 --> 999.86]  as an opportunity
[999.86 --> 1001.42]  to share the gospel
[1001.42 --> 1002.72]  I think people are more open
[1002.72 --> 1003.54]  to Christ now
[1003.54 --> 1005.06]  than perhaps ever before
[1005.06 --> 1006.82]  and we are seeing people
[1006.82 --> 1007.68]  speak about Jesus
[1007.68 --> 1008.52]  so thank you
[1008.52 --> 1009.56]  for doing that
[1009.56 --> 1011.92]  there's much to be grateful for
[1011.92 --> 1013.70]  and so there's a few things
[1013.70 --> 1014.46]  I just want to share
[1014.46 --> 1015.40]  there's lots I could say
[1015.40 --> 1016.04]  but a few things
[1016.04 --> 1016.52]  I want to share
[1016.52 --> 1017.66]  that I'm grateful for right now
[1017.66 --> 1019.14]  first is just our local church
[1019.14 --> 1019.86]  Center Church
[1019.86 --> 1021.36]  I'm thankful for all that God
[1021.36 --> 1022.32]  has done through the church
[1022.32 --> 1023.20]  and the people
[1023.20 --> 1023.84]  as they've loved
[1023.84 --> 1024.84]  and cared for one another
[1024.84 --> 1025.88]  the second
[1025.88 --> 1027.96]  that I'm very grateful for
[1027.96 --> 1029.32]  as I saw God work this year
[1029.32 --> 1031.38]  was just in the Cloverdale churches
[1031.38 --> 1032.60]  just loving and supporting
[1032.60 --> 1033.18]  the community
[1033.18 --> 1034.50]  through the Cloverdale Community Kitchen
[1034.50 --> 1035.06]  in many other
[1035.06 --> 1037.44]  different ways as well
[1037.44 --> 1039.40]  but also through Sunrise Church
[1039.40 --> 1040.10]  in particular
[1040.10 --> 1042.20]  who opened their doors to us
[1042.20 --> 1043.20]  and said
[1043.20 --> 1043.68]  Center Church
[1043.68 --> 1044.88]  you can meet in our building
[1044.88 --> 1045.86]  we're a portable church
[1045.86 --> 1046.64]  couldn't meet
[1046.64 --> 1047.42]  and they opened the doors
[1047.42 --> 1047.76]  and said
[1047.76 --> 1049.28]  hey here's a space for you to meet
[1049.28 --> 1051.02]  so thankful to Sunrise Church
[1051.02 --> 1052.24]  one of the ways that God
[1052.24 --> 1052.96]  has been at work
[1052.96 --> 1054.08]  in our church community
[1054.08 --> 1055.54]  despite all the challenges
[1055.54 --> 1056.30]  of this time
[1056.30 --> 1057.90]  has been through
[1057.90 --> 1060.08]  the setup of an online chat forum
[1060.08 --> 1062.86]  it's something that we started in March
[1062.86 --> 1064.00]  it's still going strong
[1064.00 --> 1065.82]  and it's just been a way for us
[1065.82 --> 1067.22]  to show love to one another
[1067.22 --> 1069.56]  to share photos of ourselves
[1069.56 --> 1070.98]  at worship in our homes
[1070.98 --> 1072.82]  to share prayer requests
[1072.82 --> 1073.52]  with one another
[1073.52 --> 1074.84]  it's been really remarkable
[1074.84 --> 1076.20]  how God's just used that
[1076.20 --> 1077.72]  for us to be able to share
[1077.72 --> 1078.94]  our lives together
[1078.94 --> 1079.48]  even though
[1079.48 --> 1080.88]  we can't be together
[1080.88 --> 1082.24]  as much as we usually are
[1082.24 --> 1083.80]  hi everyone
[1083.80 --> 1084.94]  I'm just here
[1084.94 --> 1086.02]  because I'm just so grateful
[1086.02 --> 1087.16]  for how the Lord has
[1087.16 --> 1088.58]  carried and sustained me
[1088.58 --> 1089.46]  this last year
[1089.46 --> 1090.54]  I've gone through
[1090.54 --> 1091.26]  some health issues
[1091.26 --> 1092.48]  with rheumatoid lung
[1092.48 --> 1093.40]  and rheumatoid arthritis
[1093.40 --> 1094.18]  which has made it
[1094.18 --> 1095.82]  very difficult for me to breathe
[1095.82 --> 1096.56]  and there have been moments
[1096.56 --> 1097.28]  of frustration
[1097.28 --> 1098.64]  feeling down
[1098.64 --> 1099.70]  but the more I kept
[1099.70 --> 1100.76]  pressing into the Lord
[1100.76 --> 1101.98]  and really hearing His voice
[1101.98 --> 1103.08]  hope just started
[1103.08 --> 1104.26]  to really rise within me
[1104.26 --> 1105.08]  so no matter
[1105.08 --> 1106.40]  what our circumstances are
[1106.40 --> 1108.08]  just hold on to that hope
[1108.08 --> 1109.90]  just like the line from the song
[1109.90 --> 1111.40]  I'm gonna sing
[1111.40 --> 1112.86]  in the middle of the storm
[1112.86 --> 1114.24]  higher and higher
[1114.24 --> 1116.00]  I'm gonna hear my praises roar
[1116.00 --> 1117.56]  up from the ashes
[1117.56 --> 1118.66]  hope will arise
[1118.66 --> 1119.98]  death is defeated
[1119.98 --> 1120.90]  the King is alive
[1120.90 --> 1123.48]  I praise and thank God
[1123.48 --> 1125.22]  for this season
[1125.22 --> 1127.16]  with His blessing
[1127.16 --> 1128.80]  and help for the churches
[1128.80 --> 1130.50]  and for allowing us
[1130.50 --> 1131.52]  to be a blessing
[1131.52 --> 1134.70]  despite this COVID-19 situation
[1134.70 --> 1136.30]  I thank God
[1136.30 --> 1137.20]  for allowing us
[1137.20 --> 1138.64]  to be agents of hope
[1138.64 --> 1140.76]  for the many lost people
[1140.76 --> 1142.30]  and that's what I pray
[1142.30 --> 1143.94]  for all of us as a church
[1143.94 --> 1146.00]  I remember our church
[1146.00 --> 1147.40]  despite we are small
[1147.40 --> 1149.36]  we just started here
[1149.36 --> 1150.22]  but then the Lord
[1150.22 --> 1151.46]  is using us
[1151.46 --> 1152.60]  in a way
[1152.60 --> 1153.94]  that we give hope
[1153.94 --> 1154.48]  to others
[1154.48 --> 1155.34]  who are hopeless
[1155.34 --> 1157.28]  and so in this season
[1157.28 --> 1158.36]  let us just be
[1158.36 --> 1159.74]  an agent of hope
[1159.74 --> 1160.96]  for everyone
[1160.96 --> 1162.38]  especially for the lost
[1162.38 --> 1164.34]  I am so thankful
[1164.34 --> 1165.14]  first of all
[1165.14 --> 1166.36]  for the sovereignty of God
[1166.36 --> 1167.30]  that we can trust Him
[1167.30 --> 1168.92]  no matter what is going on
[1168.92 --> 1169.56]  around us
[1169.56 --> 1170.54]  because He is the one
[1170.54 --> 1171.98]  who is over all of history
[1171.98 --> 1173.62]  and this is a great reminder
[1173.62 --> 1174.48]  for us in the midst
[1174.48 --> 1175.08]  of the pandemic
[1175.08 --> 1176.24]  and the pain
[1176.24 --> 1176.88]  that it's caused
[1176.88 --> 1178.54]  to trust in Him completely
[1178.54 --> 1179.40]  and so I am thankful
[1179.40 --> 1179.98]  for His sovereignty
[1179.98 --> 1180.86]  and the reminder
[1180.86 --> 1182.50]  I am also thankful
[1182.50 --> 1183.32]  for church history
[1183.32 --> 1184.12]  which is probably
[1184.12 --> 1184.82]  a little outside
[1184.82 --> 1185.30]  of the scope
[1185.30 --> 1186.78]  but as we go through
[1186.78 --> 1187.56]  difficult times
[1187.56 --> 1188.94]  it's really important
[1188.94 --> 1189.54]  for us to remember
[1189.54 --> 1190.30]  in Hebrews 11
[1190.30 --> 1191.12]  certainly a reminder
[1191.12 --> 1191.52]  of that
[1191.52 --> 1193.12]  but all of church history
[1193.12 --> 1194.36]  so filled with people
[1194.36 --> 1194.96]  who are loyal
[1194.96 --> 1195.70]  and faithful to God
[1195.70 --> 1197.26]  in the midst of crisis
[1197.26 --> 1197.96]  and tragedy
[1197.96 --> 1198.68]  and the third thing
[1198.68 --> 1199.78]  that I am extremely
[1199.78 --> 1200.44]  thankful for
[1200.44 --> 1201.96]  in the midst of this pandemic
[1201.96 --> 1203.76]  and in this last year
[1203.76 --> 1205.94]  is that the value
[1205.94 --> 1206.50]  of church
[1206.50 --> 1207.78]  the value of meeting together
[1207.78 --> 1209.50]  the treasure of being
[1209.50 --> 1210.88]  a part of a local church
[1210.88 --> 1212.20]  has really come to the front
[1212.20 --> 1213.26]  for all of us
[1213.26 --> 1215.02]  it's something we have missed
[1215.02 --> 1216.56]  and I think so often before
[1216.56 --> 1218.10]  we have taken that for granted
[1218.10 --> 1220.50]  I am just so grateful to God
[1220.50 --> 1222.00]  to be called
[1222.00 --> 1222.80]  to minister
[1222.80 --> 1224.16]  in the Cloverdale area
[1224.16 --> 1226.04]  an area that I've lived in now
[1226.04 --> 1227.08]  for 18 years
[1227.08 --> 1229.02]  and called by the Lord
[1229.02 --> 1231.44]  to see His kingdom come
[1231.44 --> 1233.46]  even in this challenging time
[1233.46 --> 1235.54]  so I want to pass on
[1235.54 --> 1236.12]  an encouragement
[1236.12 --> 1237.90]  from Pacific Community Church
[1237.90 --> 1238.98]  to all of you
[1238.98 --> 1240.34]  and from myself
[1240.34 --> 1240.96]  and my home
[1240.96 --> 1241.72]  to all of you
[1241.72 --> 1243.42]  I want to encourage you
[1243.42 --> 1244.62]  this Christmas
[1244.62 --> 1246.28]  I pray that God blesses you
[1246.28 --> 1246.78]  with hope
[1246.78 --> 1248.00]  and with faith
[1248.00 --> 1249.34]  with peace
[1249.34 --> 1250.64]  and with joy
[1250.64 --> 1252.02]  God bless you
[1252.02 --> 1253.50]  and have a wonderful Christmas
[1253.50 --> 1256.16]  in response to the underlying anxiety
[1256.16 --> 1257.00]  that many people
[1257.00 --> 1258.08]  have been experiencing
[1258.08 --> 1258.72]  and facing
[1258.72 --> 1259.68]  during this pandemic
[1259.68 --> 1261.48]  we as a church
[1261.48 --> 1262.52]  brought in the directors
[1262.52 --> 1263.90]  of Shoreline Counseling
[1263.90 --> 1265.04]  to help us navigate
[1265.04 --> 1266.80]  this incredible time
[1266.80 --> 1267.38]  of stress
[1267.38 --> 1268.14]  and uncertainty
[1268.14 --> 1270.12]  the gracious space
[1270.12 --> 1271.58]  that was created
[1271.58 --> 1272.62]  in those three sessions
[1272.62 --> 1274.06]  was a beautiful representation
[1274.06 --> 1275.68]  of the kingdom of God
[1275.68 --> 1277.72]  expressed here on earth
[1277.72 --> 1279.60]  with the interweaving
[1279.60 --> 1280.62]  of God's Holy Spirit
[1280.62 --> 1283.04]  that we were able to present
[1283.04 --> 1284.10]  and share
[1284.10 --> 1285.38]  and be present with each other
[1285.38 --> 1287.00]  in the midst of our fear
[1287.00 --> 1289.62]  in sharing our stories
[1289.62 --> 1290.26]  with each other
[1290.26 --> 1291.72]  in the light of Christ
[1291.72 --> 1293.92]  and as His light shone
[1293.92 --> 1295.14]  in the midst of our darkness
[1295.14 --> 1297.84]  we discovered in a fresh way
[1297.84 --> 1301.32]  how God's hope meets us
[1301.32 --> 1303.94]  even in the midst of our anxiety
[1303.94 --> 1305.72]  this year I've really seen
[1305.72 --> 1307.34]  God calling His people to worship
[1307.34 --> 1308.88]  and putting that desire in us
[1308.88 --> 1310.12]  whether that's all together
[1310.12 --> 1311.32]  in groups of 50
[1311.32 --> 1313.00]  just alone on our own
[1313.00 --> 1313.86]  or with our own family
[1313.86 --> 1315.06]  and I've loved seeing God
[1315.06 --> 1316.50]  move us in that way
[1316.50 --> 1317.64]  calling us to worship
[1317.64 --> 1319.30]  my thoughts on gratitude
[1319.30 --> 1319.98]  in 2020
[1319.98 --> 1322.30]  I've seen a lot more togetherness
[1322.30 --> 1323.48]  when it comes to families
[1323.48 --> 1324.38]  and neighbors
[1324.38 --> 1325.76]  people who've connected
[1325.76 --> 1326.96]  deeply with their families
[1326.96 --> 1327.68]  that other times
[1327.68 --> 1328.48]  they've been so busy
[1328.48 --> 1329.60]  people have connected
[1329.60 --> 1330.78]  deeply with their neighbors
[1330.78 --> 1332.46]  because they've had the chance
[1332.46 --> 1333.90]  to be with them
[1333.90 --> 1334.80]  and not a lot of time
[1334.80 --> 1335.60]  to do other things
[1335.60 --> 1336.68]  and one of the things
[1336.68 --> 1337.92]  I've seen in the church
[1337.92 --> 1339.42]  is an answer to the prayer
[1339.42 --> 1340.36]  in Jesus' words
[1340.36 --> 1340.94]  where He said
[1340.94 --> 1342.96]  that we would all be one
[1342.96 --> 1345.06]  so that the world may know
[1345.06 --> 1346.46]  that Jesus was sent
[1346.46 --> 1347.76]  and I really believe
[1347.76 --> 1348.50]  for a church
[1348.50 --> 1350.28]  that can be one of our finest hours
[1350.28 --> 1352.20]  is to practice togetherness
[1352.20 --> 1352.70]  and unity
[1352.70 --> 1353.76]  to maintain that
[1353.76 --> 1354.52]  as Paul said
[1354.52 --> 1355.74]  so that the world
[1355.74 --> 1356.38]  would know
[1356.38 --> 1357.66]  that Jesus was sent
[1357.66 --> 1358.90]  and that He is the Savior
[1358.90 --> 1360.36]  bless you in this new year
[1360.36 --> 1367.34]  good morning
[1367.34 --> 1367.36]  good morning
[1367.36 --> 1367.38]  good morning
[1367.38 --> 1368.46]  good morning
[1368.46 --> 1368.50]  good morning
[1368.50 --> 1369.00]  good morning
[1369.00 --> 1369.40]  good morning
[1369.40 --> 1370.02]  good morning
[1370.02 --> 1371.52]  I can't believe it's
[1371.52 --> 1373.28]  already been
[1373.28 --> 1374.86]  a whole year
[1374.86 --> 1376.08]  gone by
[1376.08 --> 1376.60]  and
[1376.60 --> 1378.00]  when we were doing
[1378.00 --> 1379.02]  the year-end review
[1379.02 --> 1380.20]  I didn't realize
[1380.20 --> 1381.28]  that I joined Hope
[1381.28 --> 1382.12]  in September
[1382.12 --> 1383.56]  it seemed
[1383.56 --> 1385.46]  so long ago
[1385.46 --> 1386.16]  that I joined
[1386.16 --> 1386.48]  but
[1386.48 --> 1388.20]  it's only
[1388.20 --> 1389.10]  three months
[1389.10 --> 1391.66]  it just goes to show
[1391.66 --> 1392.60]  how Hope
[1392.60 --> 1393.58]  has made our family
[1393.58 --> 1394.88]  feel so welcome here
[1394.88 --> 1396.42]  and we are very grateful
[1396.42 --> 1397.02]  for that
[1397.02 --> 1398.52]  so I want to add that
[1398.52 --> 1400.74]  onto the list of things
[1400.74 --> 1401.94]  that we're thankful for
[1401.94 --> 1402.92]  for this year
[1402.92 --> 1405.80]  and so
[1405.80 --> 1407.34]  when I look back
[1407.34 --> 1408.04]  on this year
[1408.04 --> 1410.14]  for this last message
[1410.14 --> 1410.70]  of the year
[1410.70 --> 1412.30]  making the intern do it
[1412.30 --> 1413.00]  I told Dave
[1413.00 --> 1414.58]  it's not very common
[1414.58 --> 1415.50]  in the context
[1415.50 --> 1416.18]  I come from
[1416.18 --> 1416.46]  where
[1416.46 --> 1417.68]  the last service
[1417.68 --> 1418.76]  the last message
[1418.76 --> 1419.18]  of the year
[1419.18 --> 1420.08]  goes to the intern
[1420.08 --> 1421.60]  so it's a lot of pressure
[1421.60 --> 1422.40]  on me personally
[1422.40 --> 1424.26]  and
[1424.26 --> 1425.34]  on top of that
[1425.34 --> 1426.64]  Dave and Sid
[1426.64 --> 1427.80]  joke that
[1427.80 --> 1429.36]  just preach on gratitude
[1429.36 --> 1430.50]  that's like the easiest thing
[1430.50 --> 1431.34]  to find in the Bible
[1431.34 --> 1433.58]  I agree
[1433.58 --> 1434.64]  I totally agree
[1434.64 --> 1435.04]  but
[1435.04 --> 1435.58]  again
[1435.58 --> 1437.14]  last service of the year
[1437.14 --> 1438.30]  making the intern do it
[1438.30 --> 1438.62]  right
[1438.62 --> 1439.46]  thanks a lot
[1439.46 --> 1442.12]  but
[1442.12 --> 1443.68]  in all honesty
[1443.68 --> 1444.96]  as I reflected back
[1444.96 --> 1445.64]  on this year
[1445.64 --> 1446.52]  and
[1446.52 --> 1447.10]  praying
[1447.10 --> 1447.76]  and meditating
[1447.76 --> 1448.32]  on this
[1448.32 --> 1449.06]  theme of
[1449.06 --> 1449.84]  Thanksgiving
[1449.84 --> 1451.46]  I
[1451.46 --> 1452.46]  was confronted
[1452.46 --> 1453.32]  more and more
[1453.32 --> 1454.46]  with the gospel message
[1454.46 --> 1456.50]  all kidding aside
[1456.50 --> 1458.36]  it has truly been
[1458.36 --> 1459.06]  a blessing for me
[1459.06 --> 1459.56]  personally
[1459.56 --> 1461.08]  to be given this topic
[1461.08 --> 1461.90]  to preach on
[1461.90 --> 1462.36]  this morning
[1462.36 --> 1464.32]  and so with that in mind
[1464.32 --> 1465.78]  please turn with me
[1465.78 --> 1466.84]  to Philippians 4
[1466.84 --> 1467.82]  as we look at
[1467.82 --> 1468.52]  today's text
[1468.52 --> 1472.48]  I believe it's going to be
[1472.48 --> 1473.36]  on the screen for you
[1473.36 --> 1474.90]  so please read with me
[1474.90 --> 1479.44]  I feel like I need to sing
[1479.44 --> 1480.60]  this first verse
[1480.60 --> 1481.48]  but I won't
[1481.48 --> 1484.26]  rejoice in the Lord
[1484.26 --> 1484.86]  always
[1484.86 --> 1486.70]  I will say it again
[1486.70 --> 1487.74]  rejoice
[1487.74 --> 1490.14]  let your gentleness
[1490.14 --> 1491.58]  be evident to all
[1491.58 --> 1493.28]  the Lord is near
[1493.28 --> 1495.40]  do not be anxious
[1495.40 --> 1496.38]  about anything
[1496.38 --> 1498.62]  but in every situation
[1498.62 --> 1499.86]  by prayer and petition
[1499.86 --> 1501.34]  with thanksgiving
[1501.34 --> 1503.50]  present your requests
[1503.50 --> 1504.84]  to God
[1504.84 --> 1507.18]  and the peace of God
[1507.18 --> 1508.06]  which transcends
[1508.06 --> 1509.18]  all understanding
[1509.18 --> 1510.54]  will guard your hearts
[1510.54 --> 1511.42]  and your minds
[1511.42 --> 1513.24]  in Jesus Christ
[1513.24 --> 1514.40]  Amen
[1514.40 --> 1520.56]  Before I get into the text
[1520.56 --> 1521.30]  I want to share
[1521.30 --> 1521.92]  some material
[1521.92 --> 1522.50]  that I learned
[1522.50 --> 1523.48]  from my history
[1523.48 --> 1524.56]  of Christianity class
[1524.56 --> 1524.96]  at Regent
[1524.96 --> 1526.56]  I get to use something
[1526.56 --> 1527.52]  that I actually learned
[1527.52 --> 1529.38]  it seemed
[1529.38 --> 1530.14]  when I looked at it
[1530.14 --> 1530.60]  at first
[1530.60 --> 1531.56]  unrealistically
[1531.56 --> 1533.02]  similar to our
[1533.02 --> 1533.74]  current situation
[1533.74 --> 1534.10]  today
[1534.10 --> 1536.40]  you may recall
[1536.40 --> 1538.34]  the plague
[1538.34 --> 1539.24]  that devastated
[1539.24 --> 1539.84]  most of Europe
[1539.84 --> 1540.88]  in the 16th century
[1540.88 --> 1541.58]  known as the
[1541.58 --> 1543.36]  Black Death
[1543.36 --> 1544.98]  the Black Plague
[1544.98 --> 1546.42]  in a newly
[1546.42 --> 1547.40]  Protestant city
[1547.40 --> 1548.64]  called Nuremberg
[1548.64 --> 1550.14]  not Nuremberg
[1550.14 --> 1551.32]  it's Nuremberg
[1551.32 --> 1551.86]  in Germany
[1551.86 --> 1552.66]  I'm not sure
[1552.66 --> 1553.68]  if I'm pronouncing it right
[1553.68 --> 1555.50]  the magistrates
[1555.50 --> 1556.88]  so leaders of the city
[1556.88 --> 1558.10]  made a guide
[1558.10 --> 1558.70]  in dealing
[1558.70 --> 1560.06]  with the pandemic
[1560.06 --> 1562.18]  so as precautions
[1562.18 --> 1563.16]  they prescribed
[1563.16 --> 1564.14]  flight from infected
[1564.14 --> 1565.22]  persons and places
[1565.22 --> 1567.54]  avoidance of large crowds
[1567.54 --> 1569.66]  recourse to various
[1569.66 --> 1570.42]  potions
[1570.42 --> 1571.26]  to ward off
[1571.26 --> 1573.50]  or treat the plague
[1573.50 --> 1575.68]  avoidance of putrid air
[1575.68 --> 1577.14]  especially the breath
[1577.14 --> 1578.12]  of those who were sick
[1578.12 --> 1580.52]  modesty in eating
[1580.52 --> 1581.82]  and physical activity
[1581.82 --> 1584.78]  periodic bloodletting
[1584.78 --> 1586.32]  and sweating
[1586.32 --> 1588.24]  and maybe they were
[1588.24 --> 1589.22]  even wearing masks
[1589.22 --> 1590.18]  or face coverings
[1590.18 --> 1592.42]  but as Christians
[1592.42 --> 1594.18]  they also encouraged
[1594.18 --> 1594.92]  their citizens
[1594.92 --> 1595.60]  by saying
[1595.60 --> 1596.90]  and this is the quote
[1596.90 --> 1597.44]  that you will see
[1597.44 --> 1597.94]  on the screen
[1597.94 --> 1601.04]  in such dangerous times
[1601.04 --> 1602.08]  there is nothing
[1602.08 --> 1603.08]  more necessary
[1603.08 --> 1604.12]  fruitful
[1604.12 --> 1605.24]  salutary
[1605.24 --> 1606.18]  or comforting
[1606.18 --> 1607.54]  than for a Christian
[1607.54 --> 1608.70]  to lift up his heart
[1608.70 --> 1609.32]  and mind
[1609.32 --> 1610.70]  to God the Father
[1610.70 --> 1611.76]  through a genuine
[1611.76 --> 1612.80]  strong
[1612.80 --> 1614.38]  and constant faith
[1614.38 --> 1615.52]  in the gracious
[1615.52 --> 1616.22]  gospel
[1616.22 --> 1618.32]  of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1618.32 --> 1619.76]  and to believe
[1619.76 --> 1620.72]  without doubt
[1620.72 --> 1621.60]  that God
[1621.60 --> 1622.26]  is our ever
[1622.26 --> 1623.12]  gracious Father
[1623.12 --> 1624.68]  who has mercifully
[1624.68 --> 1625.84]  forgiven us
[1625.84 --> 1626.70]  our sin
[1626.70 --> 1628.50]  through the suffering
[1628.50 --> 1629.32]  and death
[1629.32 --> 1631.10]  the suffering
[1631.10 --> 1631.78]  and death
[1631.78 --> 1632.32]  of Christ
[1632.32 --> 1633.68]  and who will truly
[1633.68 --> 1634.34]  and certainly
[1634.34 --> 1635.78]  give us eternal life
[1635.78 --> 1636.88]  when this life
[1636.88 --> 1637.32]  is over
[1637.32 --> 1640.84]  this
[1640.84 --> 1643.12]  this is very significant
[1643.12 --> 1643.60]  that
[1643.60 --> 1644.80]  this is being
[1644.80 --> 1645.86]  confessed
[1645.86 --> 1647.00]  during the black plague
[1647.00 --> 1648.52]  where the numbers
[1648.52 --> 1648.98]  tell us
[1648.98 --> 1650.22]  that about 500 people
[1650.22 --> 1650.74]  were dying
[1650.74 --> 1651.44]  a week
[1651.44 --> 1653.12]  in a population
[1653.12 --> 1653.70]  of about
[1653.70 --> 1654.62]  40,000
[1654.62 --> 1658.02]  you couldn't avoid
[1658.02 --> 1658.74]  thinking about
[1658.74 --> 1659.06]  death
[1659.06 --> 1659.74]  every day
[1659.74 --> 1661.82]  it was a regular
[1661.82 --> 1662.38]  suffering
[1662.38 --> 1663.34]  that they lived with
[1663.34 --> 1666.00]  to give it a little
[1666.00 --> 1666.78]  more context
[1666.78 --> 1668.22]  we're talking about
[1668.22 --> 1669.10]  the medieval ages
[1669.10 --> 1670.26]  so in the 16th century
[1670.26 --> 1671.78]  16th century
[1671.78 --> 1672.60]  where everyone
[1672.60 --> 1673.72]  recognized themselves
[1673.72 --> 1674.58]  as Christian
[1674.58 --> 1675.50]  by name
[1675.50 --> 1676.84]  but they were
[1676.84 --> 1677.74]  most of them
[1677.74 --> 1678.74]  were living in fear
[1678.74 --> 1680.38]  fear of their own
[1680.38 --> 1680.86]  salvation
[1680.86 --> 1682.06]  they're facing death
[1682.06 --> 1682.72]  every day
[1682.72 --> 1683.78]  but they weren't sure
[1683.78 --> 1684.54]  if they were being
[1684.54 --> 1685.66]  they were going to be
[1685.66 --> 1686.32]  saved or not
[1686.32 --> 1688.08]  and so that's what
[1688.08 --> 1689.18]  Martin Luther first
[1689.18 --> 1690.74]  attacked in his
[1690.74 --> 1691.48]  attack
[1691.48 --> 1693.02]  what he argued against
[1693.02 --> 1694.00]  in his
[1694.00 --> 1694.94]  reformation
[1694.94 --> 1696.08]  that
[1696.08 --> 1697.22]  the buying and selling
[1697.22 --> 1698.58]  of indulgences
[1698.58 --> 1699.16]  is wrong
[1699.16 --> 1700.66]  that we don't
[1700.66 --> 1701.58]  get to buy
[1701.58 --> 1702.10]  and sell
[1702.10 --> 1703.26]  grace from God
[1703.26 --> 1708.12]  in this context
[1708.12 --> 1709.50]  during their
[1709.50 --> 1710.04]  pandemic
[1710.04 --> 1711.08]  much the same
[1711.08 --> 1711.64]  as ours
[1711.64 --> 1713.32]  Protestant Christians
[1713.32 --> 1714.38]  so reformers
[1714.38 --> 1715.82]  in Nuremberg
[1715.82 --> 1716.48]  proclaim
[1716.48 --> 1717.60]  the peace
[1717.60 --> 1718.98]  and good news
[1718.98 --> 1720.14]  of the gospel
[1720.14 --> 1721.04]  of Jesus Christ
[1721.04 --> 1723.48]  and so with that
[1723.48 --> 1724.04]  in mind
[1724.04 --> 1724.96]  with this background
[1724.96 --> 1725.48]  in mind
[1725.48 --> 1726.58]  let us jump into
[1726.58 --> 1727.56]  our text for today
[1727.56 --> 1729.06]  and we can see
[1729.06 --> 1730.68]  how Paul starts off
[1730.68 --> 1731.36]  by emphasizing
[1731.36 --> 1732.16]  how joyful
[1732.16 --> 1733.22]  he is in the Lord
[1733.22 --> 1735.70]  so let me ask this
[1735.70 --> 1736.44]  from the get-go
[1736.44 --> 1737.96]  what do you
[1737.96 --> 1738.92]  rejoice in hope
[1738.92 --> 1741.24]  are you truly
[1741.24 --> 1742.12]  joyful that the
[1742.12 --> 1742.94]  Lord is near
[1742.94 --> 1745.30]  what about
[1745.30 --> 1746.18]  this year
[1746.18 --> 1747.14]  particularly
[1747.14 --> 1748.62]  gives you reasons
[1748.62 --> 1749.42]  for rejoicing
[1749.42 --> 1751.84]  or are you just
[1751.84 --> 1752.40]  thankful that
[1752.40 --> 1753.26]  2020 is almost
[1753.26 --> 1753.62]  over
[1753.62 --> 1757.50]  for me personally
[1757.50 --> 1759.30]  this year
[1759.30 --> 1760.20]  has really tested
[1760.20 --> 1760.82]  what my limit
[1760.82 --> 1761.68]  for Zoom is
[1761.68 --> 1763.36]  apparently it
[1763.36 --> 1764.06]  isn't very long
[1764.06 --> 1765.90]  I still remember
[1765.90 --> 1766.60]  getting the email
[1766.60 --> 1767.14]  from Regent
[1767.14 --> 1768.08]  telling us
[1768.08 --> 1768.70]  that we're going
[1768.70 --> 1769.18]  we're moving
[1769.18 --> 1770.34]  into online classes
[1770.34 --> 1771.70]  for
[1771.70 --> 1773.18]  we don't
[1773.18 --> 1774.40]  for I didn't know
[1774.40 --> 1775.42]  how long back then
[1775.42 --> 1776.56]  but that was back
[1776.56 --> 1777.02]  in March
[1777.02 --> 1778.76]  and for the foreseeable
[1778.76 --> 1779.14]  future
[1779.14 --> 1780.04]  I still see
[1780.04 --> 1780.74]  that we're going
[1780.74 --> 1781.70]  into online classes
[1781.70 --> 1783.32]  so Zoom
[1783.32 --> 1784.12]  I'm not a big fan
[1784.12 --> 1784.50]  of Zoom
[1784.50 --> 1785.64]  but I'm thankful
[1785.64 --> 1786.34]  that I'm able
[1786.34 --> 1787.44]  to continue my studies
[1787.44 --> 1788.46]  and hear
[1788.46 --> 1789.38]  and to share
[1789.38 --> 1789.98]  what I learned
[1789.98 --> 1790.82]  from my class
[1790.82 --> 1793.42]  I also remember
[1793.42 --> 1793.72]  though
[1793.72 --> 1795.36]  my parents asking me
[1795.36 --> 1796.00]  on the day
[1796.00 --> 1796.80]  of what turned out
[1796.80 --> 1798.84]  to be my last
[1798.84 --> 1799.94]  in-person class
[1799.94 --> 1800.48]  of the year
[1800.48 --> 1802.28]  to wear a mask
[1802.28 --> 1803.74]  on public transit
[1803.74 --> 1804.64]  on my way to school
[1804.64 --> 1806.28]  that we should
[1806.28 --> 1807.00]  be more careful
[1807.00 --> 1809.78]  when I first heard it
[1809.78 --> 1810.78]  when I first
[1810.78 --> 1812.46]  heard my parents' request
[1812.46 --> 1813.72]  I remember thinking
[1813.72 --> 1814.24]  in my head
[1814.24 --> 1815.98]  of how silly
[1815.98 --> 1816.50]  I would look
[1816.50 --> 1817.62]  being the only person
[1817.62 --> 1818.30]  wearing a mask
[1818.30 --> 1818.62]  I mean
[1818.62 --> 1819.54]  it wasn't very common
[1819.54 --> 1820.00]  back then
[1820.00 --> 1820.66]  I would be
[1820.66 --> 1821.12]  almost
[1821.12 --> 1823.38]  out of the very few people
[1823.38 --> 1824.90]  that would be wearing masks
[1824.90 --> 1826.68]  and I also thought
[1826.68 --> 1827.42]  up to myself
[1827.42 --> 1829.30]  I would make myself
[1829.30 --> 1829.84]  a target
[1829.84 --> 1830.80]  for people to think
[1830.80 --> 1831.78]  that I was the Asian
[1831.78 --> 1832.76]  with the coronavirus
[1832.76 --> 1836.48]  I guess it worked out
[1836.48 --> 1837.88]  that for me at least
[1837.88 --> 1838.92]  that school got cancelled
[1838.92 --> 1840.06]  that I didn't have to
[1840.06 --> 1841.02]  wear masks
[1841.02 --> 1841.92]  on public transit
[1841.92 --> 1844.60]  sadly though
[1844.60 --> 1846.24]  it also serves
[1846.24 --> 1847.02]  to remind me
[1847.02 --> 1848.06]  of the ever increasing
[1848.06 --> 1848.82]  hate crimes
[1848.82 --> 1849.70]  that have risen
[1849.70 --> 1850.40]  against Asians
[1850.40 --> 1850.96]  in Vancouver
[1850.96 --> 1853.20]  my brother-in-law
[1853.20 --> 1854.24]  who lives in Vancouver
[1854.24 --> 1855.54]  having been
[1855.54 --> 1856.94]  verbally abused as well
[1856.94 --> 1860.58]  I can feel
[1860.58 --> 1861.30]  that everyone
[1861.30 --> 1862.58]  including myself
[1862.58 --> 1863.02]  actually
[1863.02 --> 1864.48]  wants a scapegoat
[1864.48 --> 1865.76]  someone
[1865.76 --> 1866.46]  or at least
[1866.46 --> 1867.60]  something to blame
[1867.60 --> 1870.68]  what or who
[1870.68 --> 1871.78]  do I blame
[1871.78 --> 1872.74]  for the NHL season
[1872.74 --> 1873.38]  being cancelled
[1873.38 --> 1876.10]  I refer to hockey
[1876.10 --> 1876.96]  every time I preach
[1876.96 --> 1877.80]  and you can tell
[1877.80 --> 1878.44]  that I'm a fan
[1878.44 --> 1881.36]  for not being able
[1881.36 --> 1882.06]  to play soccer
[1882.06 --> 1883.36]  although I play soccer
[1883.36 --> 1884.32]  I'm a big fan of hockey
[1884.32 --> 1887.00]  but in seriousness
[1887.00 --> 1888.48]  for throwing a wrench
[1888.48 --> 1889.36]  into my life
[1889.36 --> 1890.64]  and the whole world
[1890.64 --> 1891.38]  and changing
[1891.38 --> 1892.42]  literally everything
[1892.42 --> 1895.58]  and so especially
[1895.58 --> 1896.48]  for this year
[1896.48 --> 1897.62]  suffering
[1897.62 --> 1898.88]  seems to be
[1898.88 --> 1899.56]  a common word
[1899.56 --> 1900.10]  that is being
[1900.10 --> 1900.64]  thrown around
[1900.64 --> 1903.34]  we heard today
[1903.34 --> 1904.00]  from prayers
[1904.00 --> 1905.70]  and from our
[1905.70 --> 1906.46]  ear and review
[1906.46 --> 1907.32]  of all the things
[1907.32 --> 1908.10]  that we've been through
[1908.10 --> 1909.70]  and we think about
[1909.70 --> 1910.56]  all the sufferings
[1910.56 --> 1911.12]  that we've had
[1911.12 --> 1912.24]  from loss of loved ones
[1912.24 --> 1913.60]  suffering from
[1913.60 --> 1914.22]  not being able
[1914.22 --> 1915.08]  to say goodbye
[1915.08 --> 1915.90]  to loved ones
[1915.90 --> 1918.46]  suffering with finances
[1918.46 --> 1920.68]  suffering in relationships
[1920.68 --> 1921.88]  and sadly
[1921.88 --> 1923.54]  that's regardless
[1923.54 --> 1924.26]  of COVID
[1924.26 --> 1927.54]  suffering is
[1927.54 --> 1929.18]  an unavoidable part
[1929.18 --> 1929.98]  of the life
[1929.98 --> 1930.62]  that we live
[1930.62 --> 1931.30]  in this world
[1931.30 --> 1933.90]  but the main message
[1933.90 --> 1934.90]  from today's text
[1934.90 --> 1935.38]  is that
[1935.38 --> 1936.22]  our suffering
[1936.22 --> 1937.28]  is not in vain
[1937.28 --> 1939.90]  whatever sufferings
[1939.90 --> 1940.62]  we face
[1940.62 --> 1942.26]  whether we may judge it
[1942.26 --> 1943.46]  to be small or big
[1943.46 --> 1945.80]  we suffer with Christ
[1945.80 --> 1948.66]  the Savior
[1948.66 --> 1949.98]  whom we have hope in
[1949.98 --> 1951.66]  is not a Savior
[1951.66 --> 1952.74]  who came in power
[1952.74 --> 1953.42]  and pride
[1953.42 --> 1955.22]  but is a Savior
[1955.22 --> 1956.48]  who came in suffering
[1956.48 --> 1957.32]  and humility
[1957.32 --> 1959.46]  and so I think
[1959.46 --> 1960.18]  it is very important
[1960.18 --> 1961.14]  to recognize here
[1961.14 --> 1962.96]  that Paul writes
[1962.96 --> 1963.80]  this exhortation
[1963.80 --> 1964.62]  to the Philippians
[1964.62 --> 1967.16]  not in a comfortable office
[1967.16 --> 1968.04]  sitting in a nice
[1968.04 --> 1968.76]  warm place
[1968.76 --> 1971.10]  but most likely
[1971.10 --> 1971.96]  he is in prison
[1971.96 --> 1972.62]  at this point
[1972.62 --> 1973.98]  and he is almost
[1973.98 --> 1974.90]  coming to the end
[1974.90 --> 1975.54]  of his ministry
[1975.54 --> 1976.48]  that has been
[1976.48 --> 1977.52]  full of suffering
[1977.52 --> 1979.08]  suffering for Christ
[1979.08 --> 1981.98]  what gives Paul
[1981.98 --> 1983.10]  the thought of rejoicing
[1983.10 --> 1983.88]  in the Lord then
[1983.88 --> 1985.62]  what does he
[1985.62 --> 1986.70]  have to rejoice about
[1986.70 --> 1989.00]  why does he emphasize
[1989.00 --> 1990.78]  rejoicing so much
[1990.78 --> 1994.28]  and so in verse 5
[1994.28 --> 1995.18]  of today's text
[1995.18 --> 1996.44]  Paul confesses
[1996.44 --> 1997.02]  in faith
[1997.02 --> 1998.56]  that the Lord
[1998.56 --> 1999.22]  is near
[1999.22 --> 2001.72]  we can see
[2001.72 --> 2002.44]  his hope
[2002.44 --> 2004.00]  and our hope
[2004.00 --> 2004.98]  is in the Lord
[2004.98 --> 2005.66]  Jesus Christ
[2005.66 --> 2008.02]  true joy
[2008.02 --> 2008.50]  for Paul
[2008.50 --> 2009.06]  is founded
[2009.06 --> 2009.86]  in the gospel
[2009.86 --> 2012.88]  and so
[2012.88 --> 2013.80]  this gospel
[2013.80 --> 2015.60]  what makes it
[2015.60 --> 2016.40]  good news
[2016.40 --> 2017.56]  is that
[2017.56 --> 2018.40]  for this Savior
[2018.40 --> 2019.52]  whom we have hope in
[2019.52 --> 2021.66]  we have nothing
[2021.66 --> 2022.38]  to offer him
[2022.38 --> 2023.40]  but our sinfulness
[2023.40 --> 2026.10]  what can we give
[2026.10 --> 2026.76]  to God
[2026.76 --> 2027.74]  that deserves
[2027.74 --> 2028.22]  merit
[2028.22 --> 2033.46]  whatever we do
[2033.46 --> 2034.78]  whatever we can
[2034.78 --> 2035.34]  offer God
[2035.34 --> 2037.00]  it is worthless
[2037.00 --> 2037.86]  if there is no
[2037.86 --> 2038.28]  Jesus
[2038.28 --> 2039.46]  if we are not
[2039.46 --> 2040.50]  founded in Christ
[2040.50 --> 2041.34]  if we are not
[2041.34 --> 2042.32]  founded in the gospel
[2042.32 --> 2043.94]  there is no point
[2043.94 --> 2047.24]  and so the gospel
[2047.24 --> 2048.12]  message is clear
[2048.12 --> 2049.34]  he declares
[2049.34 --> 2050.62]  sinners like us
[2050.62 --> 2051.48]  righteous
[2051.48 --> 2052.34]  and blameless
[2052.34 --> 2055.12]  and so we read
[2055.12 --> 2056.16]  in Romans 5
[2056.16 --> 2057.12]  Paul says
[2057.12 --> 2059.80]  therefore
[2059.80 --> 2060.80]  since we have
[2060.80 --> 2061.56]  been justified
[2061.56 --> 2062.46]  through faith
[2062.46 --> 2063.88]  we have peace
[2063.88 --> 2064.42]  with God
[2064.42 --> 2065.02]  through our Lord
[2065.02 --> 2065.86]  Jesus Christ
[2065.86 --> 2066.98]  through whom
[2066.98 --> 2067.76]  we have gained
[2067.76 --> 2069.12]  access by faith
[2069.12 --> 2070.46]  into this grace
[2070.46 --> 2071.28]  in which we now
[2071.28 --> 2071.76]  stand
[2071.76 --> 2073.64]  and we boast
[2073.64 --> 2074.32]  in the hope
[2074.32 --> 2074.96]  of the glory
[2074.96 --> 2075.50]  of God
[2075.50 --> 2077.78]  not only so
[2077.78 --> 2080.62]  but we also
[2080.62 --> 2081.78]  glory in our
[2081.78 --> 2082.36]  sufferings
[2082.36 --> 2085.66]  I'll read that
[2085.66 --> 2086.32]  last part again
[2086.32 --> 2088.60]  and we boast
[2088.60 --> 2089.22]  in the hope
[2089.22 --> 2089.76]  of the glory
[2089.76 --> 2090.28]  of God
[2090.28 --> 2091.34]  and not only so
[2091.34 --> 2092.38]  but we also
[2092.38 --> 2093.04]  glory
[2093.04 --> 2094.10]  in our
[2094.10 --> 2094.66]  sufferings
[2094.66 --> 2097.56]  and so I want
[2097.56 --> 2098.08]  to take a step
[2098.08 --> 2098.90]  back and see
[2098.90 --> 2099.96]  how the world
[2099.96 --> 2100.58]  deals with
[2100.58 --> 2100.90]  suffering
[2100.90 --> 2101.90]  in contrast
[2101.90 --> 2103.42]  Paul says
[2103.42 --> 2104.22]  earlier in his
[2104.22 --> 2104.66]  letter to the
[2104.66 --> 2105.08]  Philippians
[2105.08 --> 2105.68]  so we look at
[2105.68 --> 2106.42]  in chapter 3
[2106.42 --> 2107.78]  and he's talking
[2107.78 --> 2108.50]  about the enemies
[2108.50 --> 2109.02]  of the cross
[2109.02 --> 2109.44]  of Christ
[2109.44 --> 2110.24]  so he's talking
[2110.24 --> 2111.14]  about non-Christians
[2111.14 --> 2112.40]  and he's saying
[2112.40 --> 2113.54]  their destiny
[2113.54 --> 2114.46]  is destruction
[2114.46 --> 2116.06]  their God
[2116.06 --> 2116.92]  is their stomach
[2116.92 --> 2118.76]  and their glory
[2118.76 --> 2119.54]  is in their shame
[2119.54 --> 2121.30]  their mind
[2121.30 --> 2121.78]  is set
[2121.78 --> 2122.92]  on earthly things
[2122.92 --> 2124.26]  but
[2124.26 --> 2126.04]  our citizenship
[2126.04 --> 2126.92]  is in heaven
[2126.92 --> 2128.30]  and we eagerly
[2128.30 --> 2129.02]  await a savior
[2129.02 --> 2129.58]  from there
[2129.58 --> 2131.12]  the Lord Jesus Christ
[2131.12 --> 2133.38]  we also see
[2133.38 --> 2134.16]  in the Old Testament
[2134.16 --> 2135.24]  how Job says
[2135.24 --> 2135.80]  when referring
[2135.80 --> 2136.34]  to the world
[2136.34 --> 2137.68]  the godless
[2137.68 --> 2138.88]  in heart
[2138.88 --> 2139.86]  harbor resentment
[2139.86 --> 2141.70]  even when God
[2141.70 --> 2142.42]  fetters them
[2142.42 --> 2143.26]  they do not
[2143.26 --> 2143.88]  cry for help
[2143.88 --> 2145.04]  they do not repent
[2145.04 --> 2146.86]  but those
[2146.86 --> 2147.52]  who suffer
[2147.52 --> 2149.02]  God delivers
[2149.02 --> 2149.78]  in their suffering
[2149.78 --> 2151.34]  he speaks
[2151.34 --> 2151.78]  to them
[2151.78 --> 2152.68]  in their affliction
[2152.68 --> 2157.54]  the godless
[2157.54 --> 2158.50]  and the world
[2158.50 --> 2159.80]  can only deal
[2159.80 --> 2160.34]  with suffering
[2160.34 --> 2161.06]  with resentment
[2161.06 --> 2162.28]  and look
[2162.28 --> 2163.10]  to temporary
[2163.10 --> 2163.78]  happiness
[2163.78 --> 2164.68]  and satisfaction
[2164.68 --> 2166.92]  their God
[2166.92 --> 2167.86]  is their stomach
[2167.86 --> 2170.22]  they do not
[2170.22 --> 2170.80]  have Christ
[2170.80 --> 2171.48]  as their ultimate
[2171.48 --> 2171.86]  hope
[2171.86 --> 2174.66]  not that I
[2174.66 --> 2175.50]  don't enjoy
[2175.50 --> 2175.86]  a drink
[2175.86 --> 2177.14]  here and then
[2177.14 --> 2178.24]  but I'm not
[2178.24 --> 2179.00]  surprised to hear
[2179.00 --> 2179.50]  on the news
[2179.50 --> 2180.40]  that liquor stores
[2180.40 --> 2181.94]  are doing so much
[2181.94 --> 2183.04]  better now than ever
[2183.04 --> 2183.92]  during this pandemic
[2183.92 --> 2186.66]  and so I come to think
[2186.66 --> 2187.64]  in what ways
[2187.64 --> 2188.70]  have we ourselves
[2188.70 --> 2189.70]  tried to deal
[2189.70 --> 2190.22]  with suffering
[2190.22 --> 2190.96]  through temporary
[2190.96 --> 2191.44]  happiness
[2191.44 --> 2194.12]  what do we depend
[2194.12 --> 2195.22]  on in our sufferings
[2195.22 --> 2196.98]  and go further
[2196.98 --> 2197.48]  and ask
[2197.48 --> 2199.28]  what can fully
[2199.28 --> 2200.38]  satisfy our needs
[2200.38 --> 2203.36]  and so when I refer
[2203.36 --> 2204.14]  to the world
[2204.14 --> 2205.30]  and the godless
[2205.30 --> 2206.56]  I am not just
[2206.56 --> 2207.50]  talking about
[2207.50 --> 2208.08]  the sinfulness
[2208.08 --> 2209.14]  and the brokenness
[2209.14 --> 2209.74]  out there
[2209.74 --> 2211.68]  but it is also
[2211.68 --> 2212.76]  a provocation
[2212.76 --> 2213.66]  of the sinfulness
[2213.66 --> 2214.42]  within us
[2214.42 --> 2216.70]  our own brokenness
[2216.70 --> 2218.38]  we are not
[2218.38 --> 2218.88]  Christians
[2218.88 --> 2220.20]  because we don't
[2220.20 --> 2220.52]  suffer
[2220.52 --> 2222.12]  or because we
[2222.12 --> 2222.60]  can handle
[2222.60 --> 2223.58]  suffering perfectly
[2223.58 --> 2225.48]  I know I can't
[2225.48 --> 2228.54]  what distinguishes
[2228.54 --> 2229.32]  God's people
[2229.32 --> 2230.16]  from the world then
[2230.16 --> 2234.86]  through suffering
[2234.86 --> 2235.82]  and actually
[2235.82 --> 2236.98]  in all circumstances
[2236.98 --> 2239.26]  God's people
[2239.26 --> 2240.58]  are given reminders
[2240.58 --> 2242.44]  sometimes very
[2242.44 --> 2243.58]  painful reminders
[2243.58 --> 2244.98]  that there is
[2244.98 --> 2246.20]  nothing in this world
[2246.20 --> 2247.36]  that may fully
[2247.36 --> 2248.28]  satisfy us
[2248.28 --> 2251.92]  Paul directs
[2251.92 --> 2252.48]  his focus
[2252.48 --> 2254.80]  on the gospel
[2254.80 --> 2255.92]  for his rejoicing
[2255.92 --> 2257.14]  and thanksgiving
[2257.14 --> 2259.26]  and so when we
[2259.26 --> 2260.00]  gather together
[2260.00 --> 2260.66]  as a church
[2260.66 --> 2261.52]  and when we
[2261.52 --> 2262.04]  actually do
[2262.04 --> 2262.40]  get to
[2262.40 --> 2263.10]  when we get
[2263.10 --> 2264.80]  to get together
[2264.80 --> 2265.92]  I don't know
[2265.92 --> 2266.36]  if you understood
[2266.36 --> 2267.24]  when we are
[2267.24 --> 2267.94]  finally allowed
[2267.94 --> 2268.72]  to get together
[2268.72 --> 2270.66]  that's what we do
[2270.66 --> 2271.22]  as a church
[2271.22 --> 2272.32]  we remind each other
[2272.32 --> 2274.04]  that our only hope
[2274.04 --> 2274.78]  is in Christ
[2274.78 --> 2277.56]  all the ministries
[2277.56 --> 2278.28]  that we have
[2278.28 --> 2279.46]  all the ways
[2279.46 --> 2280.00]  that we serve
[2280.00 --> 2280.56]  that we looked at
[2280.56 --> 2281.02]  this morning
[2281.02 --> 2283.00]  they all point
[2283.00 --> 2283.48]  to Christ
[2283.48 --> 2284.70]  and we do
[2284.70 --> 2285.50]  this for Jesus
[2285.50 --> 2288.32]  and so
[2288.32 --> 2289.08]  as we continue
[2289.08 --> 2289.58]  to look at
[2289.58 --> 2290.46]  Paul's exhortation
[2290.46 --> 2292.14]  I found it
[2292.14 --> 2292.58]  very helpful
[2292.58 --> 2293.06]  to read the
[2293.06 --> 2294.70]  message version
[2294.70 --> 2295.70]  especially in
[2295.70 --> 2296.18]  verse 5
[2296.18 --> 2297.76]  and so I have
[2297.76 --> 2298.40]  it on the screen
[2298.40 --> 2299.46]  if you can read
[2299.46 --> 2299.78]  along
[2299.78 --> 2301.24]  it says
[2301.24 --> 2301.82]  in the message
[2301.82 --> 2302.24]  version
[2302.24 --> 2303.74]  let me read
[2303.74 --> 2304.56]  the NIV version
[2304.56 --> 2304.94]  first
[2304.94 --> 2305.58]  so that we can
[2305.58 --> 2306.34]  see the contrast
[2306.34 --> 2307.94]  in the NIV
[2307.94 --> 2308.70]  it just says
[2308.70 --> 2309.08]  that
[2309.08 --> 2310.76]  in verse 5
[2310.76 --> 2311.88]  let your gentleness
[2311.88 --> 2312.46]  be evident
[2312.46 --> 2313.06]  to all
[2313.06 --> 2314.40]  the Lord
[2314.40 --> 2314.84]  is near
[2314.84 --> 2315.80]  and so I was
[2315.80 --> 2316.32]  pondering on
[2316.32 --> 2316.58]  what that
[2316.58 --> 2317.30]  actually meant
[2317.30 --> 2319.08]  my gentleness
[2319.08 --> 2321.32]  not a very
[2321.32 --> 2322.04]  gentle person
[2322.04 --> 2322.46]  but what
[2322.46 --> 2322.92]  what does it
[2322.92 --> 2323.34]  mean to
[2323.34 --> 2324.02]  let my
[2324.02 --> 2324.84]  gentleness
[2324.84 --> 2325.36]  be evident
[2325.36 --> 2325.88]  to everyone
[2325.88 --> 2328.52]  in the message
[2328.52 --> 2328.98]  version
[2328.98 --> 2330.20]  it says
[2330.20 --> 2332.04]  make it as
[2332.04 --> 2332.66]  clear as you
[2332.66 --> 2333.00]  can
[2333.00 --> 2333.76]  to all you
[2333.76 --> 2334.04]  meet
[2334.04 --> 2334.62]  that you're
[2334.62 --> 2335.08]  on their
[2335.08 --> 2335.48]  side
[2335.48 --> 2337.12]  working with
[2337.12 --> 2337.38]  them
[2337.38 --> 2337.82]  and not
[2337.82 --> 2338.60]  against them
[2338.60 --> 2339.78]  help them
[2339.78 --> 2340.26]  to see
[2340.26 --> 2340.62]  that the
[2340.62 --> 2340.96]  master
[2340.96 --> 2341.46]  is about
[2341.46 --> 2342.06]  to arrive
[2342.06 --> 2343.22]  he could
[2343.22 --> 2343.52]  show up
[2343.52 --> 2344.06]  any minute
[2344.06 --> 2346.86]  again
[2346.86 --> 2347.48]  to reiterate
[2347.48 --> 2348.34]  our hope
[2348.34 --> 2348.98]  is in Christ
[2348.98 --> 2350.28]  and so in
[2350.28 --> 2350.98]  light of that
[2350.98 --> 2352.06]  this verse
[2352.06 --> 2352.56]  has such
[2352.56 --> 2353.10]  a missional
[2353.10 --> 2353.54]  tone
[2353.54 --> 2355.92]  help others
[2355.92 --> 2356.48]  see the
[2356.48 --> 2357.26]  eternal hope
[2357.26 --> 2357.78]  in our
[2357.78 --> 2358.40]  Lord Jesus
[2358.40 --> 2358.94]  Christ
[2358.94 --> 2360.72]  be for
[2360.72 --> 2361.02]  them
[2361.02 --> 2361.42]  and not
[2361.42 --> 2361.84]  against
[2361.84 --> 2362.14]  them
[2362.14 --> 2363.56]  help
[2363.56 --> 2363.94]  them
[2363.94 --> 2364.84]  help
[2364.84 --> 2365.34]  everyone
[2365.34 --> 2366.70]  see
[2366.70 --> 2367.00]  our
[2367.00 --> 2367.40]  master
[2367.40 --> 2369.92]  and I
[2369.92 --> 2370.06]  think
[2370.06 --> 2370.28]  that's
[2370.28 --> 2370.38]  the
[2370.38 --> 2370.62]  ultimate
[2370.62 --> 2370.98]  goal
[2370.98 --> 2371.30]  of
[2371.30 --> 2371.62]  mission
[2371.62 --> 2374.06]  moving
[2374.06 --> 2374.44]  on to
[2374.44 --> 2374.98]  verse 6
[2374.98 --> 2375.74]  Paul says
[2375.74 --> 2376.56]  don't be
[2376.56 --> 2376.94]  anxious
[2376.94 --> 2377.26]  about
[2377.26 --> 2377.72]  anything
[2377.72 --> 2378.30]  but in
[2378.30 --> 2378.54]  every
[2378.54 --> 2379.20]  situation
[2379.20 --> 2380.22]  by prayer
[2380.22 --> 2380.84]  and petition
[2380.84 --> 2381.52]  with
[2381.52 --> 2382.26]  thanksgiving
[2382.26 --> 2383.50]  present
[2383.50 --> 2383.82]  your
[2383.82 --> 2384.54]  requests
[2384.54 --> 2385.22]  to God
[2385.22 --> 2387.12]  and so
[2387.12 --> 2387.62]  I say it
[2387.62 --> 2387.84]  again
[2387.84 --> 2388.54]  Paul is
[2388.54 --> 2389.04]  not saying
[2389.04 --> 2389.42]  here that
[2389.42 --> 2389.70]  Christians
[2389.70 --> 2390.32]  should not
[2390.32 --> 2391.14]  feel anxiety
[2391.14 --> 2391.72]  or that
[2391.72 --> 2392.08]  we should
[2392.08 --> 2392.40]  not
[2392.40 --> 2392.78]  suffer
[2392.78 --> 2394.74]  we do
[2394.74 --> 2395.04]  get
[2395.04 --> 2395.42]  anxious
[2395.42 --> 2396.68]  we do
[2396.68 --> 2396.96]  go
[2396.96 --> 2397.26]  through
[2397.26 --> 2397.64]  real
[2397.64 --> 2398.08]  suffering
[2398.08 --> 2400.90]  but
[2400.90 --> 2401.50]  this is
[2401.50 --> 2402.04]  a reminder
[2402.04 --> 2403.44]  know
[2403.44 --> 2404.18]  that we
[2404.18 --> 2404.38]  have
[2404.38 --> 2404.74]  reason
[2404.74 --> 2405.20]  to have
[2405.20 --> 2405.60]  hope
[2405.60 --> 2406.16]  beyond
[2406.16 --> 2406.60]  whatever
[2406.60 --> 2406.90]  we are
[2406.90 --> 2407.14]  going
[2407.14 --> 2407.42]  through
[2407.42 --> 2409.50]  that
[2409.50 --> 2409.80]  every
[2409.80 --> 2410.34]  experience
[2410.34 --> 2410.56]  that
[2410.56 --> 2411.00]  God's
[2411.00 --> 2411.40]  people
[2411.40 --> 2412.40]  experience
[2412.40 --> 2413.40]  points
[2413.40 --> 2414.16]  and directs
[2414.16 --> 2414.60]  to
[2414.60 --> 2414.98]  Christ
[2414.98 --> 2417.22]  we may
[2417.22 --> 2417.44]  be
[2417.44 --> 2417.90]  thankful
[2417.90 --> 2418.88]  in our
[2418.88 --> 2419.26]  suffering
[2419.26 --> 2419.94]  because
[2419.94 --> 2420.66]  we share
[2420.66 --> 2421.62]  the glory
[2421.62 --> 2421.96]  that is
[2421.96 --> 2422.20]  freely
[2422.20 --> 2422.46]  given
[2422.46 --> 2422.98]  to us
[2422.98 --> 2426.22]  and so
[2426.22 --> 2426.56]  that is
[2426.56 --> 2426.78]  why
[2426.78 --> 2427.48]  Paul says
[2427.48 --> 2427.94]  again
[2427.94 --> 2428.30]  earlier
[2428.30 --> 2428.48]  in
[2428.48 --> 2428.94]  Philippians
[2428.94 --> 2429.24]  that
[2429.24 --> 2430.02]  our
[2430.02 --> 2430.52]  citizenship
[2430.52 --> 2431.10]  is not
[2431.10 --> 2431.52]  of this
[2431.52 --> 2431.88]  world
[2431.88 --> 2433.72]  we don't
[2433.72 --> 2434.10]  belong
[2434.10 --> 2434.50]  here
[2434.50 --> 2434.94]  in this
[2434.94 --> 2435.34]  world
[2435.34 --> 2436.14]  but our
[2436.14 --> 2436.68]  home
[2436.68 --> 2438.42]  is in
[2438.42 --> 2438.70]  God's
[2438.70 --> 2438.96]  kingdom
[2438.96 --> 2440.28]  where we
[2440.28 --> 2440.90]  are fully
[2440.90 --> 2441.64]  glorified
[2441.64 --> 2442.14]  in unity
[2442.14 --> 2442.76]  with Christ
[2442.76 --> 2443.84]  that is
[2443.84 --> 2444.28]  where our
[2444.28 --> 2444.70]  hope is
[2444.70 --> 2445.00]  founded
[2445.00 --> 2445.26]  in
[2445.26 --> 2447.12]  and so
[2447.12 --> 2447.74]  again
[2447.74 --> 2448.38]  Paul says
[2448.38 --> 2448.96]  in Romans
[2448.96 --> 2450.72]  we suffer
[2450.72 --> 2451.40]  with him
[2451.40 --> 2452.24]  in order
[2452.24 --> 2452.64]  that we
[2452.64 --> 2453.20]  may also
[2453.20 --> 2454.22]  be glorified
[2454.22 --> 2454.76]  with him
[2454.76 --> 2459.04]  and remember
[2459.04 --> 2460.22]  the already
[2460.22 --> 2460.72]  not yet
[2460.72 --> 2461.02]  kingdom
[2461.02 --> 2461.58]  of God
[2461.58 --> 2463.40]  I appreciate
[2463.40 --> 2464.02]  our
[2464.02 --> 2464.58]  reformed
[2464.58 --> 2464.96]  tradition
[2464.96 --> 2465.62]  I say
[2465.62 --> 2466.00]  our
[2466.00 --> 2466.60]  I'm not
[2466.60 --> 2467.88]  from the
[2467.88 --> 2468.30]  reformed
[2468.30 --> 2468.64]  tradition
[2468.64 --> 2469.50]  very similar
[2469.50 --> 2470.22]  but I
[2470.22 --> 2470.60]  appreciate
[2470.60 --> 2471.22]  this part
[2471.22 --> 2471.84]  a lot
[2471.84 --> 2473.36]  the already
[2473.36 --> 2473.84]  not yet
[2473.84 --> 2474.12]  kingdom
[2474.12 --> 2474.60]  of God
[2474.60 --> 2475.04]  explains
[2475.04 --> 2475.72]  so much
[2475.72 --> 2476.92]  that here
[2476.92 --> 2477.94]  in the
[2477.94 --> 2478.52]  not yet
[2478.52 --> 2480.12]  here
[2480.12 --> 2481.12]  we suffer
[2481.12 --> 2482.48]  awaiting
[2482.48 --> 2483.54]  the eternal
[2483.54 --> 2484.52]  already
[2484.52 --> 2484.96]  kingdom
[2484.96 --> 2485.46]  of God
[2485.46 --> 2485.72]  that we
[2485.72 --> 2486.28]  believe in
[2486.28 --> 2489.54]  and so
[2489.54 --> 2489.86]  in the
[2489.86 --> 2490.42]  last verse
[2490.42 --> 2491.00]  of today's
[2491.00 --> 2491.36]  text
[2491.36 --> 2492.20]  it says
[2492.20 --> 2493.52]  the peace
[2493.52 --> 2494.24]  of God
[2494.24 --> 2496.20]  shalom
[2496.20 --> 2497.76]  God's
[2497.76 --> 2498.36]  wholeness
[2498.36 --> 2498.98]  for his
[2498.98 --> 2499.38]  people
[2499.38 --> 2500.46]  and creation
[2500.46 --> 2502.40]  which transcends
[2502.40 --> 2503.52]  all understanding
[2503.52 --> 2504.30]  that we
[2504.30 --> 2504.64]  cannot
[2504.64 --> 2505.32]  understand
[2505.32 --> 2506.50]  will guard
[2506.50 --> 2507.18]  our hearts
[2507.18 --> 2507.64]  and our
[2507.64 --> 2508.02]  minds
[2508.02 --> 2509.36]  in
[2509.36 --> 2510.16]  Christ
[2510.16 --> 2510.72]  Jesus
[2510.72 --> 2513.46]  everything
[2513.46 --> 2514.28]  is centered
[2514.28 --> 2514.78]  on
[2514.78 --> 2515.22]  Christ
[2515.22 --> 2519.56]  and so
[2519.56 --> 2519.90]  let me
[2519.90 --> 2520.42]  finish this
[2520.42 --> 2520.84]  morning with
[2520.84 --> 2521.20]  a short
[2521.20 --> 2521.70]  testimony
[2521.70 --> 2525.64]  based on
[2525.64 --> 2526.02]  personal
[2526.02 --> 2526.62]  experience
[2526.62 --> 2527.26]  suffering
[2527.26 --> 2527.92]  may sometimes
[2527.92 --> 2528.54]  feel like
[2528.54 --> 2529.28]  it throws
[2529.28 --> 2529.58]  you off
[2529.58 --> 2529.96]  balance
[2529.96 --> 2531.76]  it leaves
[2531.76 --> 2532.20]  a hole
[2532.20 --> 2533.44]  a missing
[2533.44 --> 2533.92]  piece of
[2533.92 --> 2534.28]  the puzzle
[2534.28 --> 2534.82]  of my soul
[2534.82 --> 2535.26]  if you will
[2535.26 --> 2538.16]  in my case
[2538.16 --> 2538.66]  it literally
[2538.66 --> 2539.14]  threw me
[2539.14 --> 2539.72]  off balance
[2539.72 --> 2542.38]  along with
[2542.38 --> 2543.02]  other conditions
[2543.02 --> 2544.02]  I was diagnosed
[2544.02 --> 2544.68]  with something
[2544.68 --> 2545.08]  called
[2545.08 --> 2545.68]  Meniere's
[2545.68 --> 2545.94]  disease
[2545.94 --> 2547.28]  I had no idea
[2547.28 --> 2547.84]  what that was
[2547.84 --> 2548.38]  until I had to
[2548.38 --> 2548.88]  look it up
[2548.88 --> 2550.02]  during my time
[2550.02 --> 2550.38]  in Korea
[2550.38 --> 2552.56]  basically what it
[2552.56 --> 2553.22]  means is that
[2553.22 --> 2554.00]  you hear constant
[2554.00 --> 2554.84]  ringing in your ears
[2554.84 --> 2555.46]  called tinnitus
[2555.46 --> 2556.90]  it comes and
[2556.90 --> 2557.26]  goes
[2557.26 --> 2559.18]  and you also
[2559.18 --> 2559.60]  have
[2559.60 --> 2560.86]  random episodes
[2560.86 --> 2561.42]  of vertigo
[2561.42 --> 2562.26]  so you get
[2562.26 --> 2563.04]  dizzy and you
[2563.04 --> 2563.88]  faint
[2563.88 --> 2567.18]  people who know
[2567.18 --> 2567.46]  me
[2567.46 --> 2568.14]  tell me
[2568.14 --> 2568.74]  especially my
[2568.74 --> 2569.04]  wife
[2569.04 --> 2570.44]  constantly tell me
[2570.44 --> 2571.10]  that I have a
[2571.10 --> 2572.14]  high EQ level
[2572.14 --> 2573.04]  I wish I had
[2573.04 --> 2574.08]  an IQ level
[2574.08 --> 2575.86]  but she says
[2575.86 --> 2576.46]  I have a
[2576.46 --> 2577.56]  high EQ level
[2577.56 --> 2578.44]  I'm very emotional
[2578.44 --> 2579.54]  you can probably
[2579.54 --> 2580.04]  see that
[2580.04 --> 2581.74]  and that I get
[2581.74 --> 2582.42]  too emotionally
[2582.42 --> 2583.32]  involved in
[2583.32 --> 2583.90]  situations
[2583.90 --> 2586.06]  and so when I
[2586.06 --> 2587.16]  counseled
[2587.16 --> 2587.98]  students in
[2587.98 --> 2588.32]  Korea
[2588.32 --> 2590.64]  mostly middle
[2590.64 --> 2591.12]  and high school
[2591.12 --> 2591.60]  students
[2591.60 --> 2593.72]  a lot of them
[2593.72 --> 2594.14]  came from
[2594.14 --> 2594.96]  broken families
[2594.96 --> 2596.42]  had depression
[2596.42 --> 2597.92]  anxiety problems
[2597.92 --> 2599.04]  addiction problems
[2599.04 --> 2600.28]  violence problems
[2600.28 --> 2600.66]  etc
[2600.66 --> 2602.54]  those things
[2602.54 --> 2602.96]  threw me
[2602.96 --> 2603.56]  off balance
[2603.56 --> 2606.18]  what I usually
[2606.18 --> 2606.54]  do
[2606.54 --> 2607.38]  and what my
[2607.38 --> 2608.54]  personality
[2608.54 --> 2609.56]  demands of me
[2609.56 --> 2609.84]  is
[2609.84 --> 2611.04]  I treat
[2611.04 --> 2611.82]  their problems
[2611.82 --> 2612.30]  as if
[2612.30 --> 2613.06]  it's my own
[2613.06 --> 2614.68]  and so
[2614.68 --> 2615.24]  some of you
[2615.24 --> 2616.18]  may think
[2616.18 --> 2616.62]  wow
[2616.62 --> 2617.32]  John is such
[2617.32 --> 2618.06]  a great person
[2618.06 --> 2618.92]  wow
[2618.92 --> 2620.50]  he's a great guy
[2620.50 --> 2622.00]  taking others
[2622.00 --> 2622.76]  problems
[2622.76 --> 2623.50]  and making it
[2623.50 --> 2623.96]  his own
[2623.96 --> 2625.28]  and sympathizing
[2625.28 --> 2625.68]  with them
[2625.68 --> 2627.34]  thank you
[2627.34 --> 2627.74]  if you think
[2627.74 --> 2628.16]  that way
[2628.16 --> 2629.46]  you may commend
[2629.46 --> 2630.08]  me for it
[2630.08 --> 2631.48]  but in reality
[2631.48 --> 2633.16]  in my time
[2633.16 --> 2633.52]  in Korea
[2633.52 --> 2634.04]  it was more
[2634.04 --> 2634.74]  harmful than
[2634.74 --> 2635.12]  helpful
[2635.12 --> 2636.62]  in my opinion
[2636.62 --> 2638.30]  without
[2638.30 --> 2639.36]  exaggerating
[2639.36 --> 2640.80]  I visited
[2640.80 --> 2641.44]  clinics and
[2641.44 --> 2641.88]  hospitals
[2641.88 --> 2642.34]  weekly
[2642.34 --> 2644.24]  during my
[2644.24 --> 2644.72]  almost six
[2644.72 --> 2645.10]  years in
[2645.10 --> 2645.34]  Korea
[2645.34 --> 2648.68]  not just
[2648.68 --> 2649.02]  for the
[2649.02 --> 2649.34]  Meniere's
[2649.34 --> 2649.62]  disease
[2649.62 --> 2650.52]  other conditions
[2650.52 --> 2650.86]  as well
[2650.86 --> 2653.12]  I feel like
[2653.12 --> 2654.10]  I'm kind of like
[2654.10 --> 2655.44]  picturing myself
[2655.44 --> 2656.40]  as if I'm like
[2656.40 --> 2656.98]  a very sick
[2656.98 --> 2657.36]  person
[2657.36 --> 2657.90]  I'm not
[2657.90 --> 2658.82]  and I've gotten
[2658.82 --> 2659.44]  much better
[2659.44 --> 2660.36]  especially here
[2660.36 --> 2660.76]  in Canada
[2660.76 --> 2661.20]  and one of the
[2661.20 --> 2661.74]  biggest reasons
[2661.74 --> 2662.26]  that we moved
[2662.26 --> 2662.98]  back to Canada
[2662.98 --> 2664.00]  was my health
[2664.00 --> 2665.36]  reasons as well
[2665.36 --> 2666.92]  but I'm thankful
[2666.92 --> 2668.44]  that here
[2668.44 --> 2669.66]  at least I am
[2669.66 --> 2670.90]  keeping up my
[2670.90 --> 2671.18]  health
[2671.18 --> 2671.84]  somewhat
[2671.84 --> 2675.06]  but again
[2675.06 --> 2676.10]  as I think
[2676.10 --> 2676.54]  back
[2676.54 --> 2678.12]  and reflect
[2678.12 --> 2679.06]  on that time
[2679.06 --> 2679.74]  during my
[2679.74 --> 2681.04]  time in Korea
[2681.04 --> 2683.02]  I wrestled
[2683.02 --> 2683.94]  and lamented
[2683.94 --> 2686.02]  a lot
[2686.02 --> 2686.42]  in my
[2686.42 --> 2686.92]  sufferings
[2686.92 --> 2689.14]  and in these
[2689.14 --> 2689.80]  situations
[2689.80 --> 2691.16]  I was
[2691.16 --> 2691.82]  painfully
[2691.82 --> 2692.30]  reminded
[2692.30 --> 2693.52]  that my
[2693.52 --> 2694.58]  only hope
[2694.58 --> 2694.90]  and my
[2694.90 --> 2695.48]  satisfaction
[2695.48 --> 2697.34]  the only
[2697.34 --> 2698.04]  one who is
[2698.04 --> 2698.52]  able to
[2698.52 --> 2699.20]  make me
[2699.20 --> 2699.62]  whole
[2699.62 --> 2700.86]  and make
[2700.86 --> 2701.66]  all of
[2701.66 --> 2702.08]  creation
[2702.08 --> 2702.82]  whole again
[2702.82 --> 2705.10]  is God
[2705.10 --> 2708.54]  God sent
[2708.54 --> 2709.04]  a savior
[2709.04 --> 2709.68]  for us
[2709.68 --> 2710.90]  and he
[2710.90 --> 2711.38]  saved us
[2711.38 --> 2712.02]  through his
[2712.02 --> 2712.70]  suffering
[2712.70 --> 2716.00]  the reason
[2716.00 --> 2716.78]  we rejoice
[2716.78 --> 2717.06]  then
[2717.06 --> 2718.22]  the reason
[2718.22 --> 2718.76]  we can
[2718.76 --> 2719.54]  praise our
[2719.54 --> 2719.94]  God
[2719.94 --> 2721.10]  in thanksgiving
[2721.10 --> 2722.36]  even in our
[2722.36 --> 2722.86]  sufferings
[2722.86 --> 2723.54]  is because
[2723.54 --> 2724.26]  we believe
[2724.26 --> 2724.74]  and we
[2724.74 --> 2725.20]  confess
[2725.20 --> 2726.10]  that he
[2726.10 --> 2726.90]  will make
[2726.90 --> 2727.32]  it right
[2727.32 --> 2728.38]  that God
[2728.38 --> 2728.90]  will make
[2728.90 --> 2729.52]  everything
[2729.52 --> 2730.18]  whole again
[2730.18 --> 2732.34]  and we
[2732.34 --> 2732.78]  proclaim
[2732.78 --> 2733.44]  in victory
[2733.44 --> 2734.24]  that he
[2734.24 --> 2735.12]  has already
[2735.12 --> 2735.64]  accomplished
[2735.64 --> 2736.16]  this
[2736.16 --> 2736.96]  through Jesus
[2736.96 --> 2737.40]  Christ
[2737.40 --> 2738.98]  the already
[2738.98 --> 2739.80]  not yet
[2739.80 --> 2741.68]  and so
[2741.68 --> 2742.06]  no matter
[2742.06 --> 2742.84]  what we've
[2742.84 --> 2743.34]  been through
[2743.34 --> 2744.54]  or are still
[2744.54 --> 2745.12]  going through
[2745.12 --> 2746.04]  especially this
[2746.04 --> 2746.34]  year
[2746.34 --> 2747.60]  we can still
[2747.60 --> 2748.22]  be thankful
[2748.22 --> 2749.92]  we have
[2749.92 --> 2750.82]  hope
[2750.82 --> 2751.46]  and we
[2751.46 --> 2751.88]  share the
[2751.88 --> 2752.28]  glory
[2752.28 --> 2752.88]  that is
[2752.88 --> 2753.34]  given to
[2753.34 --> 2753.56]  us
[2753.56 --> 2753.94]  through our
[2753.94 --> 2754.98]  Lord Jesus
[2754.98 --> 2755.44]  Christ
[2755.44 --> 2756.90]  and so
[2756.90 --> 2757.56]  for this
[2757.56 --> 2758.26]  last message
[2758.26 --> 2759.36]  of the year
[2759.36 --> 2760.30]  I hope
[2760.30 --> 2762.04]  I have
[2762.04 --> 2762.48]  directed
[2762.48 --> 2762.92]  and we
[2762.92 --> 2763.50]  have shared
[2763.50 --> 2764.12]  how our
[2764.12 --> 2764.68]  hope is in
[2764.68 --> 2765.24]  Jesus Christ
[2765.24 --> 2765.76]  there is
[2765.76 --> 2766.32]  nothing more
[2766.32 --> 2767.20]  that is what
[2767.20 --> 2767.84]  church is about
[2767.84 --> 2768.26]  and we
[2768.26 --> 2768.82]  gather to
[2768.82 --> 2769.34]  worship the
[2769.34 --> 2769.78]  God

[2770.44 --> 2770.76]  freely
[2770.76 --> 2771.32]  given us
[2771.32 --> 2772.12]  the glory
[2772.12 --> 2772.58]  that we
