[0.00 → 6.76] Well, good morning, Hope.
[7.12 → 10.86] It's good to be together in our homes as a body.
[11.12 → 13.04] And yes, it does feel like a return to March.
[13.32 → 15.76] But as Val said so well at the beginning of our service,
[16.20 → 18.34] gathered or scattered, we are still the church.
[18.68 → 21.82] And it's a gift to gather around the scriptures together this morning.
[21.96 → 23.88] I do encourage you, if you're in your home right now,
[24.28 → 27.24] grab the family Bible or grab your Bibles.
[27.24 → 30.00] And because a point in this sermon,
[30.10 → 32.22] I'd like for us to stop and look at a verse specifically.
[32.96 → 34.38] And I'd love for you to have it on your lap
[34.38 → 37.04] so you could spend some time with it even after this morning's service.
[38.60 → 42.06] We are closing up our series on 1 Thessalonians.
[42.58 → 44.68] We've been on this journey for a number of weeks now.
[45.06 → 47.96] And I hope you've been able to take in the gift that this book has been
[47.96 → 52.72] as it speaks into very relevantly what it means to stand firm in the gospel of Jesus
[52.72 → 56.88] amidst pressure, amidst opposition, amidst hostility.
[57.24 → 61.40] What this book has to teach us about holiness and purity in our relationships,
[61.64 → 63.12] in our marriages, in our families.
[63.62 → 66.26] And finally, what it means to be a people who live in hope,
[66.82 → 70.24] who do not fear death, who do not fear Christ's return.
[70.68 → 74.18] In fact, we live in hope that Jesus will come to finish what he started,
[74.34 → 76.24] and that is to renew all things.
[77.60 → 78.72] This is the passage.
[79.16 → 80.42] We're closing the book.
[80.42 → 85.78] In this book, Paul speaks into how the church is to live between here and the return of Jesus,
[85.86 → 87.42] between resurrection and return.
[87.54 → 88.42] What do we do now?
[88.92 → 92.88] How do we live as the body, now filled with the Spirit, with the life of Christ,
[92.94 → 95.30] as we wait and hope for the day he returns?
[95.86 → 97.22] This is what Paul has to say.
[97.32 → 101.36] So turn with me to 1 Thessalonians 5, and we'll begin at verse 12.
[101.36 → 110.76] Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you,
[111.24 → 113.80] who care for you in the Lord, and who admonish you.
[114.56 → 117.70] Hold them in the highest regard and love because of their work.
[118.96 → 120.98] Live in peace with each other.
[121.76 → 125.12] And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive.
[125.12 → 127.42] Encourage the disheartened.
[127.84 → 128.74] Help the weak.
[129.02 → 130.72] Be patient with everyone.
[131.74 → 134.70] Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong,
[135.08 → 139.82] but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.
[140.56 → 142.00] Rejoice always.
[142.44 → 143.60] Pray continually.
[144.02 → 148.38] Give thanks in all circumstances for this as God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[149.52 → 152.12] Do not put out the Spirit's fire.
[152.12 → 156.26] Do not treat prophecies with contempt, but test them all.
[156.56 → 157.76] Hold on to what is good.
[158.08 → 160.08] Reject whatever is harmful.
[161.40 → 167.46] May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through.
[168.26 → 173.94] May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[174.38 → 178.92] The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
[179.72 → 181.38] Brothers and sisters, pray for us.
[181.38 → 184.04] Greet all God's people with a holy kiss.
[184.48 → 188.70] I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.
[189.12 → 192.42] The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
[192.42 → 208.20] When I read this passage the first time, the first thought that came to mind of what it reminds me of is parents dropping their kids off to university.
[209.14 → 212.16] Dropping their son or daughter off for the very first time on campus.
[212.16 → 218.34] And I imagine this long drive where they get to talk about the opportunities and the challenges of this new season.
[218.80 → 223.74] I imagine them taking the luggage out of the car and bringing it to the dorm where the child's going to stay.
[224.16 → 224.90] Settling them in.
[224.90 → 228.38] And then comes that moment where they finally have to say goodbye.
[229.00 → 238.46] And at that moment, the parents stand in the doorway, and they just can't help but pour out their hearts and share just rapid fire, loving instruction.
[238.96 → 240.86] Take your studies seriously.
[240.86 → 244.20] Take the gift of this season well.
[245.46 → 247.04] Don't waste your time.
[248.28 → 250.94] Don't waste your time partying.
[251.58 → 252.88] Choose your friends wisely.
[253.04 → 253.84] Care for your faith.
[254.00 → 254.78] Find a good church.
[255.06 → 256.12] Don't forget to call us.
[256.22 → 256.92] Tell us how you're doing.
[257.12 → 258.02] We love you.
[258.36 → 258.62] Goodbye.
[258.62 → 258.74] Goodbye.
[260.08 → 263.86] Paul is doing something like that in this passage.
[264.20 → 270.58] As he's closing out this very rich and brief letter, he says to them in rapid fire succession,
[270.78 → 271.76] care for your leaders.
[271.90 → 272.82] Take care of one another.
[273.14 → 273.96] Help the weak.
[274.18 → 275.20] Encourage the disheartened.
[275.48 → 277.30] Test the spirits.
[277.78 → 280.40] Make sure you live the faith.
[281.82 → 283.04] I love you.
[283.36 → 284.18] Grace and peace.
[284.96 → 286.70] That's how Paul finishes this passage.
[286.70 → 292.56] And although there are a lot of small instructions, and I can't even touch on all of them in this passage this morning,
[292.86 → 297.52] a lot of these instructions boil down to one thing, relationships.
[298.84 → 304.56] Paul spends so much time at the end of this book saying, let's look at your relationships.
[305.60 → 312.26] Because the life of Jesus needs to be lived out in your family, in your church body.
[312.26 → 317.00] And the world needs to see what relationships look like renewed in Jesus.
[317.68 → 320.88] He looks at relationships between the church and its leaders.
[321.06 → 326.24] He looks at relationships between believers in the church, between believers and those with whom they're in conflict with,
[326.50 → 328.24] believers and the people in this city.
[328.42 → 330.16] It's all about relationships.
[330.16 → 336.94] One of my last classes at Regent College, I was sitting under a teacher named Paul Stevens.
[337.08 → 339.86] In fact, I think it was one of his last classes because he's now retired.
[340.60 → 346.72] And he spent a lot of time just sharing wisdom from ministry that he lived in, what he's learned along the way.
[346.80 → 351.54] And in one particular class where he was talking about what it was like to lose loved ones and lose friends,
[351.54 → 357.52] and sit with them in the hospital as they're breathing their last breath and speak words of life and encouragement into them.
[357.56 → 365.50] He said, you know, in those moments, those last moments of life, nobody talks about their job.
[366.40 → 368.60] Nobody talks about the degrees they acquired.
[368.78 → 370.52] Nobody talks about the size of their home.
[370.70 → 372.12] Nobody talks about where they travelled.
[372.44 → 376.90] All they want to talk about and pray about is relationships.
[376.90 → 384.88] And all that seems to matter in the end is what was the health of those relationships.
[385.96 → 392.84] And Paul wants to focus the last few moments he has in this letter to say, let's look at the health of your relationships.
[393.34 → 397.68] Because in the end, the health of the church is not just in organized ministries.
[397.84 → 398.62] It's not in programs.
[398.72 → 399.72] It's not all the stuff.
[399.82 → 402.56] It's the heart and the health of the people.
[402.56 → 411.32] If in their speaking and living and serving, the life of Jesus is animating and there's grace, there's mercy, there's love, there's life.
[412.56 → 418.34] The first relationship Paul looks at is the one between the church and its leaders.
[419.32 → 424.98] And it's evident in what he says that there's conflict between the church and its leaders.
[425.48 → 429.68] He never mentions what it is, but there seems to be tensions such that Paul has to speak into this.
[429.68 → 437.18] And if you've been in churches long enough, you'll know that tension between leaders and the body is not uncommon, sadly.
[438.62 → 447.50] There are a lot of times when people leave the church, sadly, because the pastors have failed them in one way or another.
[448.72 → 456.74] If you read the news long enough, you'll see that there's a lot of people who leave the church because their pastors failed morally in ways that do so much damage to the church.
[456.74 → 466.68] Also, on the other side, there are a lot of pastors who have to leave their churches because they've been so hurt by the body, by other leaders.
[467.38 → 472.08] And for the sake of their family, for the sake of their marriage, for the sake of their kids, they need to leave their church.
[472.42 → 475.18] In our own denomination, we have this thing called an Article 17.
[475.76 → 480.32] It's an ominous church word for breakup between a pastor and their church.
[480.32 → 488.44] And there's actually a team of people who've been studying these Article 17s because there have been so many in our own denomination over the last number of years.
[488.52 → 494.22] People want to know what's leading to such a spike in separation between pastors and churches.
[494.32 → 495.24] So this matters.
[495.90 → 497.66] And we want to hear what Paul has to say.
[497.66 → 499.74] And the first thing he says is,
[500.64 → 515.48] Now, before I say a word about what Paul's saying to the body about how they should view their leaders,
[516.60 → 520.38] Paul assumes three things that have to be true about the leaders that need to be seen.
[521.00 → 523.26] Number one, the leaders need to be working.
[523.98 → 525.66] They need to be working hard.
[525.66 → 529.12] They're not people who are just sitting on their hands doing nothing.
[529.24 → 533.84] They're not taking advantage of the generosity of the church that cares for them financially and in other ways.
[534.10 → 536.74] They're not supposed to be wasting their time away on social media.
[537.18 → 541.38] They are working in ministry on the ground.
[541.56 → 545.72] In fact, I'm struck by how, for Paul, the leaders are the labourers.
[546.18 → 548.10] They're the people doing the work.
[548.20 → 549.78] In our minds and culture, at least,
[549.86 → 552.18] we often think that as you rise in leadership,
[552.78 → 555.62] somehow you tell other people to do the work, and you don't have to do it.
[555.82 → 557.68] Paul says, No, no, the leaders are your labourers.
[557.72 → 560.52] They're the ones on the ground doing the work of ministry.
[561.22 → 562.36] They must be working hard.
[562.42 → 562.98] That's the first thing.
[563.04 → 567.00] The second thing he assumes is that they care for the church in the Lord,
[567.24 → 571.96] that they have a distinct desire to love and nurture the faith of the people in that church
[571.96 → 576.02] such that they experience the life of Jesus in their lives.
[576.72 → 578.18] They're not just filling their time.
[578.44 → 579.82] They're not just performing clerical duties.
[579.82 → 581.70] They're there because they care.
[582.68 → 585.10] And I can tell you, as I know the pastors in our own city,
[585.48 → 587.66] the pastors I know are there because they care.
[587.80 → 591.42] And a lot would say, I would much prefer the ease of another vocation,
[591.52 → 592.92] but I'm here because I care.
[594.20 → 596.48] Thirdly, actually, I will add to that,
[596.70 → 598.66] one of the things that struck me when I first came to Hope
[598.66 → 602.08] and when Sid and I were talking about the growth of our church
[602.08 → 604.22] and how to unfold people who are new to our church,
[604.22 → 607.30] one of the comments he said to me that stuck with me since then
[607.30 → 610.30] was that when people decide to stay in a church,
[610.56 → 612.40] you know, there's this category of church shopping,
[612.64 → 614.90] and maybe some are in that category right now online.
[615.72 → 618.16] But Pastor Sid said to me, you know, what I've learned over the years
[618.16 → 621.06] is that people stay in churches not just because of a dynamic preacher
[621.06 → 624.36] or because of a perfect worship style or one particular program.
[624.36 → 628.72] They stay in churches when they're cared for meaningfully,
[629.74 → 631.78] when their families are being discipled,
[631.78 → 635.00] when they're actually being nurtured in the life of the gospel in relationships.
[635.26 → 636.88] Those are the churches where people stay.
[637.22 → 639.20] And that sort of gave us a focused vision
[639.20 → 642.08] for what our job should be as our church grows.
[643.62 → 646.52] Thirdly, Paul assumes that the leaders of the church
[646.52 → 648.22] are doing this work of admonishing.
[649.38 → 651.80] And we don't use that word very often, and we like it even less.
[651.98 → 653.68] No one likes to be admonished.
[654.34 → 658.68] But admonish is an important part, an extension of the care.
[658.68 → 662.06] When you care for someone, and you love them, you admonish them.
[662.14 → 663.88] In fact, in this passage, in the next verse,
[663.98 → 665.64] the same word admonish is translated,
[665.70 → 668.06] or the Greek word for admonish is translated to warn.
[668.88 → 670.52] Admonishing is to warn people.
[670.94 → 672.50] And in this passage, it says to the whole church,
[672.96 → 674.82] warn the people who are idle.
[675.66 → 676.24] Warn them.
[676.98 → 678.42] Tell them they're going off the tracks,
[678.50 → 681.38] and they need to be warned to return to a faithful lifestyle.
[682.34 → 683.74] That's what admonishing is.
[683.90 → 687.06] And I think a good way of thinking about the ministry of admonishing for leaders
[687.06 → 689.28] is actually the ministry of parenting.
[690.92 → 692.30] Parents love their kids.
[692.90 → 695.24] That's why in one sentence, a parent can say to their child,
[695.50 → 696.88] I love you so much.
[697.36 → 699.16] I care for you so much.
[699.40 → 702.12] You are such a gifted little boy.
[702.58 → 704.64] But if you kick your sister in the face again,
[705.06 → 706.22] there's going to be consequences.
[706.88 → 707.84] I love you.
[708.64 → 710.50] That is like ministry all the time.
[710.66 → 711.88] I love you so much.
[711.94 → 713.40] I'm so thankful you're part of our church.
[713.40 → 716.80] But don't throw your marriage away for that co-worker who's flirting with you.
[716.90 → 717.98] It's a bad idea.
[718.10 → 719.30] It's going to bring a lot of pain.
[719.56 → 720.36] You've been warned.
[721.06 → 722.18] Or I love you so much.
[722.22 → 724.62] I'm so thankful you're involved in this ministry of our church.
[724.80 → 727.64] But do not visit those websites late at night.
[727.70 → 728.90] It's going to destroy your soul.
[730.02 → 731.24] We love you so much.
[731.28 → 732.56] We're thankful you joined our church.
[732.78 → 737.92] But please stop trying to feed the idol of consumption in your heart
[737.92 → 740.80] throughout the course of Advent with online shopping.
[740.80 → 743.22] Fill in your blank.
[743.34 → 744.70] That's the work of the church.
[745.20 → 748.62] And so often, it is the gift to anyone who joins
[748.62 → 750.66] to have a leader and a brother and sister,
[750.80 → 752.92] and the church itself is called to mutual admonishment,
[753.34 → 755.50] speak the words that need to be spoken.
[756.02 → 757.44] This is sin.
[758.76 → 760.14] This needs to change.
[760.42 → 762.50] And I speak it because I care.
[763.94 → 765.92] Before Paul says anything to the church,
[766.12 → 768.94] the assumptions are that the leaders are working hard,
[768.94 → 771.18] they care for the brothers and sisters.
[771.28 → 774.16] They want to see the life of Jesus take hold of the church.
[774.44 → 777.22] And thirdly, they are speaking those hard words of love
[777.22 → 779.60] so that people stay on the path of faithfulness.
[781.06 → 785.48] And I will add, it's assumed that the body holds the leadership
[785.48 → 786.58] to that standard.
[787.00 → 788.56] That when there's no hard work being done,
[788.62 → 789.70] when there's no care happening,
[789.94 → 791.36] when admonishment has fallen through the cracks,
[791.44 → 792.56] that someone's like, hey, leaders,
[792.82 → 794.10] this is what you're called to be.
[794.66 → 796.32] This is what it means to be under shepherds
[796.32 → 798.28] in the flock that Jesus Christ died for.
[800.16 → 801.68] Then Paul says to the church,
[801.78 → 805.18] simply acknowledge the work that's being done.
[805.44 → 807.62] Hold these leaders in high respect.
[807.76 → 809.90] And I'll pause and say, yes, it feels a bit strange
[809.90 → 811.38] to be a leader in the church,
[811.56 → 813.32] talking about how people in the church
[813.32 → 814.90] are supposed to acknowledge the work
[814.90 → 815.78] of the leaders in the church,
[815.94 → 817.04] but I have to preach it.
[817.56 → 818.76] And if you feel convicted by it,
[818.78 → 820.30] well, that's between you and the Holy Spirit.
[822.02 → 823.14] Paul is basically saying,
[823.14 → 825.74] acknowledge their worth and the value of the work
[825.74 → 827.34] of the leaders in the church.
[828.14 → 829.00] Love them.
[830.06 → 832.74] They deserve your love and your care.
[834.68 → 835.16] Amen.
[839.80 → 841.22] Now, even in this season,
[841.90 → 845.26] there's been a lot of challenge in this dynamic
[845.26 → 846.30] for almost every church.
[846.38 → 848.18] In fact, I think COVID is a litmus test
[848.18 → 849.86] that rises to the surface
[849.86 → 852.48] what kind of relationship the leaders in the church has.
[852.48 → 854.26] And I want to speak just personally for a moment
[854.26 → 856.32] about how I've seen this in our own church.
[856.66 → 858.42] And I want to say in the first place,
[858.84 → 860.76] given all the hard decisions we've made
[860.76 → 862.82] and all the challenging decisions we've had to make,
[863.00 → 865.80] I'm so thankful for the love
[865.80 → 867.76] and the support of this congregation.
[868.06 → 869.12] Yes, there's been some disagreement.
[869.28 → 870.40] How can there not be
[870.40 → 871.92] with some of the decisions we've had to make?
[872.08 → 873.06] But on the whole,
[873.84 → 875.38] I speak on behalf of the staff
[875.38 → 878.10] when I say we feel very loved and very supported.
[878.60 → 880.60] In fact, even when we sent an email out this week
[880.60 → 881.42] saying, hey everyone,
[881.96 → 883.58] our in-person worship is being cancelled,
[883.78 → 884.56] new health orders,
[884.66 → 885.84] we're going to move our worship online.
[886.00 → 888.02] The first set of emails I received
[888.02 → 890.94] were, hey, thank you so much for the email.
[891.16 → 892.38] We're praying for you guys.
[892.38 → 894.32] We really appreciate what you're doing.
[895.10 → 895.84] Thank you.
[896.78 → 898.14] And I want to speak also
[898.14 → 900.68] about the history of this church
[900.68 → 901.92] and caring for its pastors.
[902.26 → 903.30] You know, it's very rare
[903.30 → 905.64] to have a pastor serve in one church
[905.64 → 907.42] for 24 years.
[908.12 → 909.62] Pastor Sid has been here 24 years.
[909.62 → 911.60] The average stay of a pastor
[911.60 → 913.74] is seven years in a congregation.
[913.86 → 914.72] Then something happens
[914.72 → 915.98] and they have to leave or whatever.
[916.18 → 917.24] I'm not sure all the dynamics,
[917.40 → 917.96] but it's seven years.
[918.16 → 920.22] You have more than tripled that number.
[921.34 → 922.78] Now you've given him two heart attacks.
[923.22 → 924.40] We should probably talk about that.
[924.56 → 925.78] But you've tripled the number
[925.78 → 926.64] of an average stay
[926.64 → 928.44] and that's an encouragement to the body.
[928.84 → 930.04] You have learned to love
[930.04 → 931.20] and care and support
[931.20 → 933.56] and hold your leaders in high regard.
[933.84 → 934.72] Even this week,
[935.30 → 936.16] when Pastor Sid came home
[936.16 → 937.08] from the hospital on Tuesday
[937.08 → 937.76] and I called him
[937.76 → 938.06] and I just said,
[938.06 → 938.64] how are you doing?
[938.78 → 940.32] One of the first things he said is,
[940.98 → 943.22] I feel so loved.
[944.52 → 945.64] Because of all the texts,
[945.78 → 946.46] all the calls,
[946.66 → 947.30] all the emails,
[947.46 → 948.44] all the prayer,
[949.02 → 949.86] you are a church
[949.86 → 951.12] that knows how to love your leaders.
[951.22 → 952.04] So thank you.
[952.12 → 953.12] On behalf of the staff,
[953.20 → 954.28] on behalf of Pastor Sid,
[954.70 → 955.30] thank you.
[956.40 → 957.92] But I do want to underscore
[957.92 → 960.26] what's at stake
[960.26 → 961.98] and why Paul cares so much
[961.98 → 962.72] about this dynamic
[962.72 → 963.36] between the leaders
[963.36 → 964.52] and the whole body.
[964.52 → 966.40] so much is at stake
[966.40 → 967.30] when there's conflict.
[968.00 → 968.48] When people,
[968.84 → 969.40] the church,
[969.80 → 970.80] proclaims the gospel,
[970.92 → 972.44] we proclaim a gospel of peace,
[972.74 → 974.12] we proclaim a gospel of reconciliation,
[974.78 → 975.90] we proclaim a gospel
[975.90 → 977.54] of mercy and of grace.
[977.82 → 978.50] And when the tension
[978.50 → 979.64] between a pastor and a church
[979.64 → 980.40] is so real
[980.40 → 981.84] that people can't see that,
[981.92 → 982.54] that's a problem.
[983.66 → 985.14] Or to say it how my mother-in-law says it,
[985.18 → 987.06] the reputation of Jesus Christ
[987.06 → 988.32] is at stake
[988.32 → 989.80] in our relationships.
[989.80 → 992.92] And so often the case that happens
[992.92 → 994.42] is when there's so much tension
[994.42 → 995.58] between leaders and a body,
[996.04 → 996.94] ministry dries up
[996.94 → 998.38] and mission dies off.
[999.24 → 1000.62] So much is at stake
[1000.62 → 1001.70] in that health
[1001.70 → 1002.84] and that love
[1002.84 → 1003.66] and that care
[1003.66 → 1004.64] and that respect
[1004.64 → 1005.98] between leaders and a church.
[1007.74 → 1009.34] That's the first set of relationships
[1009.34 → 1010.20] that Paul talks about.
[1010.24 → 1010.90] The second one
[1010.90 → 1012.76] is between believers in the church.
[1013.06 → 1014.60] And he says the first word
[1014.60 → 1015.56] to the church
[1015.56 → 1017.38] as we think about one and other,
[1017.46 → 1017.86] he says,
[1017.86 → 1020.70] live at peace
[1020.70 → 1021.82] with one another.
[1022.52 → 1023.30] That is to say,
[1023.36 → 1024.38] he's inviting the believers
[1024.38 → 1026.04] into an active posture
[1026.04 → 1027.64] of making peace.
[1027.92 → 1028.82] Peace is not,
[1028.88 → 1029.38] let me be clear,
[1029.44 → 1031.48] it is not the absence of conflict.
[1032.34 → 1032.76] If you're married,
[1032.86 → 1033.42] you know this.
[1033.72 → 1035.40] Peace is not the absence of conflict.
[1035.72 → 1036.98] It is leaning into
[1036.98 → 1038.66] in humility and love
[1038.66 → 1039.66] to a healthy,
[1039.88 → 1040.78] God-honouring,
[1041.08 → 1042.04] faithful relationship
[1042.04 → 1043.50] in spite of those differences.
[1043.80 → 1045.28] We will always have differences.
[1045.28 → 1048.02] But learning how to live in peace
[1048.02 → 1049.22] is a distinct calling
[1049.22 → 1049.94] of the church.
[1050.76 → 1052.22] And it's also a declaration
[1052.22 → 1053.80] in the way we live
[1053.80 → 1055.58] of the reconciling power
[1055.58 → 1056.28] of the gospel.
[1057.24 → 1057.98] Now two weeks ago,
[1058.18 → 1058.96] we did an interview
[1058.96 → 1060.22] with a pastor named Jim Mullins
[1060.22 → 1061.24] on this very thing.
[1061.54 → 1063.32] The talk was on peacemaking.
[1063.72 → 1063.98] In fact,
[1064.02 → 1064.92] if you'd like to watch it,
[1064.98 → 1065.42] there's an interview,
[1065.54 → 1066.96] it's posted on our public Facebook page
[1066.96 → 1067.92] and it's well worth
[1067.92 → 1069.00] the one hour of your time.
[1069.24 → 1070.04] And we just asked him,
[1070.14 → 1070.94] what does it look like
[1070.94 → 1071.48] for the church
[1071.48 → 1072.52] to be a community
[1072.52 → 1074.86] defined by peacemaking?
[1075.82 → 1076.38] And Jim,
[1076.46 → 1077.44] in all of his illustrations,
[1077.64 → 1078.82] came back more than once
[1078.82 → 1080.38] to the very simple,
[1080.60 → 1081.82] profound teaching of Jesus
[1081.82 → 1082.42] where he said,
[1082.92 → 1084.28] take the log
[1084.28 → 1085.80] out of your own eye
[1085.80 → 1089.58] before chasing after the speck
[1089.58 → 1091.46] in the other person's eye
[1091.46 → 1093.30] on social media,
[1093.90 → 1095.24] which goes over so well,
[1095.36 → 1095.94] we all know.
[1096.96 → 1097.90] And Jim said,
[1098.34 → 1100.66] if we just started there
[1100.66 → 1101.90] in that posture
[1101.90 → 1103.10] of self-examination,
[1103.22 → 1103.58] that posture
[1103.58 → 1104.54] of self-repentance,
[1104.58 → 1105.84] of sorting out our own stuff,
[1105.98 → 1107.04] and then spoke
[1107.04 → 1107.74] with our friends,
[1107.86 → 1108.28] our neighbours,
[1108.38 → 1109.12] our brothers and sisters
[1109.12 → 1109.56] in the church,
[1109.80 → 1111.12] so much of our conflict
[1111.12 → 1112.04] would be on its way
[1112.04 → 1112.96] to reconciliation
[1112.96 → 1114.22] and resolution.
[1115.50 → 1115.94] Humility,
[1117.28 → 1117.90] love,
[1118.80 → 1119.30] peace.
[1121.02 → 1122.08] Paul then goes on
[1122.08 → 1123.56] in verse 14 and 15
[1123.56 → 1124.74] to give a set
[1124.74 → 1126.86] of five specific instructions
[1126.86 → 1127.60] and I'll walk through
[1127.60 → 1128.76] each of these briefly.
[1129.16 → 1129.58] He writes,
[1129.58 → 1130.50] we urge you,
[1130.60 → 1131.42] brothers and sisters,
[1131.80 → 1133.08] warn those who are idle
[1133.08 → 1133.64] and disruptive,
[1134.74 → 1136.02] encourage the disheartened,
[1136.70 → 1137.60] help the weak,
[1138.10 → 1139.50] be patient with everyone,
[1139.72 → 1140.80] and make sure nobody
[1140.80 → 1142.44] pays back wrong for wrong,
[1142.76 → 1143.82] always strive to do
[1143.82 → 1144.88] what is good for each other
[1144.88 → 1146.44] and everyone else.
[1147.36 → 1148.06] Now my first thought
[1148.06 → 1149.24] when I read that passage is,
[1149.54 → 1150.54] Paul calls at the beginning
[1150.54 → 1151.68] of this book,
[1152.12 → 1153.34] this church a model church.
[1153.72 → 1154.40] And when I read this,
[1154.46 → 1154.72] I think,
[1155.02 → 1155.96] they're such wonderfully
[1155.96 → 1156.92] ordinary people,
[1157.42 → 1158.56] just like the rest of us.
[1158.56 → 1160.50] What a human community
[1160.50 → 1161.48] Paul is writing to.
[1161.54 → 1162.84] There are believers in the church
[1162.84 → 1164.82] who are idle and disruptive.
[1165.74 → 1166.58] There are different reasons
[1166.58 → 1167.22] that people give
[1167.22 → 1168.06] on this idleness.
[1168.74 → 1169.66] Some suggest that
[1169.66 → 1170.90] they believe Jesus
[1170.90 → 1172.16] was coming back so soon
[1172.16 → 1173.28] they weren't working.
[1173.54 → 1174.12] They were just twiddling
[1174.12 → 1174.50] their thumbs,
[1174.62 → 1175.44] waiting for that moment.
[1175.90 → 1176.40] And so Paul says,
[1176.48 → 1177.22] get back to work.
[1177.90 → 1179.14] Or perhaps they were
[1179.14 → 1180.80] in this client-patron relationship
[1180.80 → 1181.56] where they were receiving
[1181.56 → 1182.12] so much money,
[1182.30 → 1182.96] they didn't have to work
[1182.96 → 1183.70] and they just sat around
[1183.70 → 1184.50] being disruptive
[1184.50 → 1185.10] with their lives.
[1185.10 → 1186.20] And in both cases,
[1186.52 → 1187.32] whatever it may be,
[1187.64 → 1188.94] Paul says to the other believers,
[1189.36 → 1190.44] go to those believers
[1190.44 → 1190.94] and say to them,
[1191.00 → 1191.76] we love you.
[1192.04 → 1193.32] We love you so much.
[1193.60 → 1194.64] Now get to work.
[1195.02 → 1195.72] Use your gifts
[1195.72 → 1196.56] to build up the body,
[1196.74 → 1197.52] to serve the city.
[1197.70 → 1198.58] You've got a good life
[1198.58 → 1199.92] to live and serve with.
[1200.76 → 1201.74] Warn those who are idols.
[1201.82 → 1202.58] That's the first thing.
[1203.60 → 1203.98] Secondly,
[1204.46 → 1205.00] there were believers
[1205.00 → 1205.84] who were struggling
[1205.84 → 1207.74] and needed to be encouraged.
[1207.96 → 1208.26] He says,
[1208.38 → 1209.98] encourage the disheartened.
[1210.94 → 1211.82] Now there are a number of things,
[1211.94 → 1212.08] again,
[1212.14 → 1212.82] that that could be.
[1213.16 → 1213.74] There's a good reason
[1213.74 → 1214.94] to think that many are disheartened
[1214.94 → 1216.18] because they've lost loved ones
[1216.18 → 1216.94] due to persecution
[1216.94 → 1218.44] or they're disheartened
[1218.44 → 1219.04] simply because
[1219.04 → 1220.42] there's such heavy persecution
[1220.42 → 1222.44] and they're losing hope
[1222.44 → 1223.62] for what's happening.
[1223.76 → 1224.48] They're losing hope
[1224.48 → 1225.82] to keep living out their faith.
[1226.08 → 1226.48] And Paul says,
[1226.62 → 1227.84] go to those brothers and sisters
[1227.84 → 1230.68] and be ministers of encouragement.
[1232.32 → 1232.50] Man,
[1232.52 → 1233.04] I have to say,
[1233.12 → 1234.18] that is such a ministry
[1234.18 → 1235.28] that we need right now.
[1236.42 → 1237.66] So many of us
[1237.66 → 1238.92] need to be receiving
[1238.92 → 1240.92] and sharing those words
[1240.92 → 1241.72] of life.
[1242.54 → 1243.48] Picking up the phone.
[1243.48 → 1243.82] Yes,
[1243.94 → 1244.72] we still can talk
[1244.72 → 1245.10] on the phone,
[1245.22 → 1245.60] by the way.
[1245.96 → 1247.22] Firing off the text
[1247.22 → 1247.82] saying,
[1247.96 → 1248.12] hey,
[1248.54 → 1249.36] how are you doing?
[1249.74 → 1250.84] You came to mind today
[1250.84 → 1251.60] and I just want to say
[1251.60 → 1252.18] I miss you.
[1252.82 → 1254.40] I miss being in small group together.
[1254.80 → 1256.12] I miss seeing you in worship.
[1256.72 → 1257.70] How are you doing?
[1258.04 → 1259.34] And then taking the opportunity
[1259.34 → 1261.94] to speak words of encouragement.
[1262.32 → 1263.30] Do not underestimate
[1263.30 → 1265.88] how powerful this ministry is.
[1266.98 → 1267.36] Third,
[1267.70 → 1268.34] there were those
[1268.34 → 1269.08] who were weak
[1269.08 → 1270.24] who needed help.
[1270.46 → 1271.50] Now that could be physically,
[1271.62 → 1272.22] they could be sick
[1272.22 → 1273.10] and they needed care.
[1273.10 → 1274.66] This is before hospitals
[1274.66 → 1275.24] were organized
[1275.24 → 1275.82] and the community
[1275.82 → 1276.40] was really,
[1276.56 → 1277.14] really necessary.
[1277.66 → 1278.44] Or perhaps,
[1278.94 → 1279.64] they were struggling
[1279.64 → 1280.38] in their faith.
[1280.50 → 1281.40] We could also mean
[1281.40 → 1282.18] they had doubts
[1282.18 → 1283.06] and confusion
[1283.06 → 1284.14] and they were just not sure
[1284.14 → 1284.58] what to make
[1284.58 → 1284.96] of what it meant
[1284.96 → 1285.64] to follow Jesus.
[1285.98 → 1286.94] In either case,
[1287.40 → 1288.26] the church was called
[1288.26 → 1289.60] to surround those people,
[1289.72 → 1290.58] to love those people,
[1290.64 → 1291.54] to care for their needs,
[1291.68 → 1292.26] both physically
[1292.26 → 1293.04] and spiritually,
[1293.62 → 1294.36] with the questions
[1294.36 → 1295.08] and their wrestling.
[1295.50 → 1296.16] To be people
[1296.16 → 1296.92] who come along
[1296.92 → 1297.82] and lift
[1297.82 → 1298.64] and walk with
[1298.64 → 1299.84] those who are weak.
[1300.64 → 1301.36] And likewise,
[1301.62 → 1302.62] that ministry exists
[1302.62 → 1304.54] in equal urgency today
[1304.54 → 1305.82] in the Western church
[1305.82 → 1306.72] where I was just told
[1306.72 → 1308.26] four people walk away
[1308.26 → 1308.84] from the faith
[1308.84 → 1309.44] in the U.S.
[1309.44 → 1310.62] for every one person
[1310.62 → 1311.24] who comes.
[1313.90 → 1314.38] Fourthly,
[1315.20 → 1315.84] there were just people
[1315.84 → 1316.20] in the church
[1316.20 → 1317.14] who were straight up difficult.
[1318.28 → 1318.56] I mean,
[1318.60 → 1319.48] that's not our church.
[1320.48 → 1321.42] That was that church.
[1321.90 → 1322.66] But Paul just says,
[1323.06 → 1324.10] be patient
[1324.10 → 1325.74] with everyone.
[1326.66 → 1327.58] There's this posture
[1327.58 → 1328.20] that he's inviting
[1328.20 → 1328.74] the church into,
[1328.92 → 1330.44] not just an act of patience
[1330.44 → 1331.12] where you just let
[1331.12 → 1331.84] something slide,
[1331.94 → 1332.84] but this posture
[1332.84 → 1333.68] of enduring,
[1334.44 → 1336.56] long-suffering patience
[1336.56 → 1337.82] with people
[1337.82 → 1338.82] who are very much
[1338.82 → 1339.54] not like you,
[1339.92 → 1341.06] who think very different
[1341.06 → 1341.78] thoughts than you,
[1341.98 → 1343.00] who have these habits
[1343.00 → 1343.88] that drive you
[1343.88 → 1344.84] up the wall.
[1345.14 → 1345.46] Paul says,
[1345.52 → 1346.42] be patient with them.
[1346.56 → 1347.32] And not just people
[1347.32 → 1347.76] in your church.
[1347.82 → 1348.04] He says,
[1348.28 → 1348.74] everyone.
[1349.56 → 1350.20] The person who's
[1350.20 → 1351.22] hoarding toilet paper
[1351.22 → 1351.84] at Costco.
[1352.66 → 1353.36] Or how about this?
[1353.36 → 1354.44] Just being patient
[1354.44 → 1355.12] at Costco.
[1356.24 → 1357.32] Or anywhere else
[1357.32 → 1357.92] in traffic
[1357.92 → 1359.18] with the neighbour
[1359.18 → 1359.84] to your right.
[1359.92 → 1360.96] The person in the cubicle
[1360.96 → 1361.84] to your left.
[1362.42 → 1363.32] The person who you've
[1363.32 → 1364.48] not talked to for months
[1364.48 → 1365.18] because you can't
[1365.18 → 1365.66] handle them.
[1365.96 → 1366.60] Be patient.
[1367.42 → 1368.28] Long-suffering
[1368.28 → 1369.16] and enduring.
[1370.74 → 1371.28] And finally,
[1371.40 → 1372.62] Paul says to them,
[1373.16 → 1373.90] now do not follow
[1373.90 → 1374.66] the way of the world.
[1374.72 → 1375.44] And this one is just
[1375.44 → 1376.38] getting right at the heart
[1376.38 → 1376.82] of what it means
[1376.82 → 1377.50] to follow Jesus.
[1377.64 → 1377.96] He says,
[1378.04 → 1378.72] make sure nobody
[1378.72 → 1379.30] pays back.
[1379.42 → 1380.18] Wrong for wrong,
[1380.18 → 1381.36] but always strive
[1381.36 → 1382.38] to do what is good
[1382.38 → 1383.16] for each other
[1383.16 → 1384.72] and for everyone else.
[1386.22 → 1387.04] And you can imagine
[1387.04 → 1387.90] the church then.
[1388.42 → 1389.32] They were being persecuted.
[1389.46 → 1390.08] There was hostility.
[1390.24 → 1390.88] There's a good chance
[1390.88 → 1392.06] people lost their jobs
[1392.06 → 1393.16] because they were Christians.
[1393.46 → 1394.30] You can imagine
[1394.30 → 1395.20] the kind of hate
[1395.20 → 1396.78] and hostility
[1396.78 → 1397.40] that would come
[1397.40 → 1398.12] in this circumstance.
[1398.76 → 1400.10] That desire for revenge,
[1400.24 → 1401.38] that desire to pay back,
[1401.64 → 1402.90] that desire to repay evil
[1402.90 → 1403.44] with evil,
[1403.58 → 1404.18] hurt for hurt,
[1404.30 → 1405.14] punch for punch.
[1405.74 → 1406.66] And the same goes today.
[1406.72 → 1407.82] We've got a different circumstance,
[1408.04 → 1409.24] but the same temptation
[1409.24 → 1410.58] runs through the human heart now
[1410.58 → 1413.24] to respond to that nasty email
[1413.24 → 1414.84] by elevating your game
[1414.84 → 1415.52] and just showing them
[1415.52 → 1416.58] how nasty you can be.
[1417.14 → 1417.58] Have you done that
[1417.58 → 1418.04] in this season?
[1418.60 → 1419.48] Or responding
[1419.48 → 1421.02] to that passive-aggressive text
[1421.02 → 1422.24] with another equally
[1422.24 → 1423.34] impressively
[1423.34 → 1424.68] passive-aggressive text.
[1426.32 → 1427.22] Words of hate
[1427.22 → 1427.96] returned
[1427.96 → 1429.08] to words of hate.
[1429.20 → 1429.82] How's that going,
[1429.92 → 1430.34] by the way?
[1430.74 → 1431.72] How's your relationship doing?
[1431.76 → 1432.50] Is it getting better
[1432.50 → 1433.98] with punch for punch,
[1434.68 → 1435.84] nastiness for nastiness?
[1435.84 → 1436.52] Jesus,
[1437.00 → 1438.02] in his life,
[1438.62 → 1439.14] invites us
[1439.14 → 1439.78] to this posture
[1439.78 → 1441.42] of absorbing sin.
[1442.98 → 1443.98] Absorbing sin
[1443.98 → 1445.98] and doing good
[1445.98 → 1447.44] even to those
[1447.44 → 1448.82] who are your enemies.
[1449.02 → 1449.56] And Paul says,
[1449.68 → 1450.38] that's the posture
[1450.38 → 1450.88] of the church.
[1451.56 → 1452.68] You respond to evil
[1452.68 → 1453.52] with good.
[1453.86 → 1454.34] And good,
[1454.44 → 1455.18] not just for the people
[1455.18 → 1455.54] in your church,
[1455.60 → 1456.40] but for the city.
[1457.12 → 1458.42] That's who you are.
[1458.72 → 1459.48] That's what you've been
[1459.48 → 1460.54] baptized into.
[1460.86 → 1462.20] That's the life of Jesus
[1462.20 → 1463.04] in this community.
[1463.04 → 1464.66] This is how
[1464.66 → 1465.96] your relationships
[1465.96 → 1467.24] should look.
[1468.74 → 1469.16] Now,
[1469.24 → 1470.56] I'm just going to pause here.
[1471.26 → 1472.06] And I want to put up
[1472.06 → 1472.66] on the screen
[1472.66 → 1474.88] verses 14 and 15.
[1476.00 → 1476.32] Hopefully,
[1476.40 → 1476.96] we can do that.
[1478.04 → 1479.40] And I just want to ask you
[1479.40 → 1479.88] the question,
[1480.70 → 1482.28] what's gripping your heart
[1482.28 → 1483.34] in these words?
[1484.02 → 1484.66] You can talk
[1484.66 → 1485.30] as your families
[1485.30 → 1486.46] and as you're watching
[1486.46 → 1487.00] the live stream.
[1487.50 → 1488.54] When you look at this,
[1489.40 → 1490.78] what's just tugging
[1490.78 → 1491.28] at your heart?
[1491.36 → 1491.96] Are there areas where,
[1492.08 → 1492.20] okay,
[1492.20 → 1492.48] okay,
[1492.58 → 1493.60] this is encouraging to me,
[1493.66 → 1494.18] this is happening,
[1494.28 → 1494.88] but other areas
[1494.88 → 1495.30] where you're thinking,
[1495.60 → 1497.10] this is just something
[1497.10 → 1498.12] I don't want to deal with
[1498.12 → 1500.26] because it's surfacing
[1500.26 → 1501.14] some stuff in me,
[1501.20 → 1501.98] some things I've done,
[1502.08 → 1503.04] some relationships I have
[1503.04 → 1503.88] that just need attention
[1503.88 → 1504.78] and I need repentance.
[1505.28 → 1507.44] I want you to not neglect
[1507.44 → 1508.86] what's going on
[1508.86 → 1509.54] inside of you
[1509.54 → 1511.12] and take the time today,
[1511.78 → 1513.34] even around the lunch table,
[1513.90 → 1515.22] to have a conversation
[1515.22 → 1516.52] about this specific
[1516.52 → 1517.38] set of instructions
[1517.38 → 1518.52] because Paul is speaking
[1518.52 → 1519.04] to people
[1519.04 → 1519.98] who need to hear it.
[1519.98 → 1521.30] He wanted this letter
[1521.30 → 1522.70] read to the whole community
[1522.70 → 1524.18] so that those
[1524.18 → 1524.96] who were convicted,
[1525.28 → 1525.90] so that those
[1525.90 → 1526.82] who were being challenged
[1526.82 → 1528.20] needed to deal with it.
[1528.92 → 1529.42] And so I think
[1529.42 → 1530.20] it's only fitting
[1530.20 → 1530.94] that we put this
[1530.94 → 1531.66] in front of ourselves
[1531.66 → 1532.06] and we say,
[1532.18 → 1532.30] okay,
[1532.44 → 1533.52] how can I be someone
[1533.52 → 1534.24] who helps the weak?
[1534.44 → 1535.62] Who are the weak in my life?
[1535.78 → 1536.84] How can I encourage
[1536.84 → 1537.48] the disheartened?
[1537.66 → 1538.98] How can I repay good
[1538.98 → 1539.58] for evil
[1539.58 → 1541.26] and follow the way of Christ?
[1541.26 → 1542.42] And in so doing,
[1542.54 → 1543.36] don't miss this,
[1544.00 → 1544.94] show them
[1544.94 → 1546.22] the transformation
[1546.22 → 1547.02] of the gospel.
[1547.92 → 1548.90] So take the time
[1548.90 → 1549.72] with this passage.
[1551.24 → 1552.68] But let me also say
[1552.68 → 1553.46] what I think
[1553.46 → 1554.18] you're all feeling,
[1554.68 → 1557.14] that this is a huge order.
[1558.08 → 1558.34] I mean,
[1558.50 → 1559.84] what a massive set
[1559.84 → 1560.30] of instructions.
[1560.44 → 1561.86] Like the bar is up here.
[1562.62 → 1564.10] Respond to evil with good.
[1564.28 → 1564.90] Be patient.
[1565.08 → 1565.46] Encourage.
[1565.84 → 1566.26] Help.
[1566.64 → 1567.62] It's this incredible
[1567.62 → 1568.20] new ethic
[1568.20 → 1568.92] of following Jesus
[1568.92 → 1569.74] that all of us are like,
[1569.86 → 1570.86] how in the world
[1570.86 → 1571.88] do we do this?
[1572.22 → 1573.28] And you need to know
[1573.28 → 1575.34] that Paul never writes something
[1575.34 → 1576.52] that's simply there
[1576.52 → 1577.42] to oppress you.
[1578.44 → 1579.46] He never gives instructions
[1579.46 → 1579.86] that he think,
[1579.98 → 1580.48] oh man,
[1580.54 → 1581.38] this is just going to make them
[1581.38 → 1582.58] feel so bad about themselves.
[1582.72 → 1583.54] They'll never be able
[1583.54 → 1584.04] to do it.
[1584.84 → 1586.30] Paul truly believes
[1586.30 → 1587.64] that because the church
[1587.64 → 1588.60] has the spirit
[1588.60 → 1590.50] and because Jesus defeated
[1590.50 → 1591.42] the power of sin,
[1591.70 → 1592.98] that new way of life
[1592.98 → 1593.68] was possible.
[1594.52 → 1595.48] That old age
[1595.48 → 1596.74] has been put to end
[1596.74 → 1597.40] in the death
[1597.40 → 1598.22] and resurrection of Jesus
[1598.22 → 1599.30] and the new life
[1599.30 → 1600.38] has broken into the present
[1600.38 → 1602.42] and this way of life
[1602.42 → 1603.92] is possible.
[1604.60 → 1605.18] In its fullness?
[1605.44 → 1605.66] No.
[1605.92 → 1607.00] But in baby steps?
[1607.78 → 1608.22] Absolutely.
[1608.74 → 1609.62] And I've seen it
[1609.62 → 1610.54] in our church.
[1610.66 → 1612.24] Even in the last few months,
[1612.42 → 1613.26] I've seen it.
[1613.86 → 1614.64] Be encouraged.
[1615.94 → 1616.72] It shouldn't surprise
[1616.72 → 1617.14] any of us
[1617.14 → 1617.92] that right after giving
[1617.92 → 1618.70] these incredible
[1618.70 → 1619.84] ethical instructions,
[1620.36 → 1621.34] Paul shifts to say,
[1621.96 → 1624.10] pray continually.
[1625.88 → 1626.96] Pray continually.
[1627.68 → 1628.32] And it's his way
[1628.32 → 1628.64] of saying,
[1628.64 → 1629.62] this kind of life,
[1629.74 → 1630.48] this kind of posture,
[1630.60 → 1631.50] this kind of ethic,
[1631.88 → 1633.10] it does not depend
[1633.10 → 1633.88] on human strength.
[1633.94 → 1634.54] You can't do this
[1634.54 → 1634.96] on your own.
[1635.22 → 1636.08] You need the power
[1636.08 → 1636.72] of the spirit,
[1637.06 → 1637.84] the life of Jesus
[1637.84 → 1639.42] to invade your life
[1639.42 → 1640.66] individually and communally
[1640.66 → 1641.86] such that you can
[1641.86 → 1642.82] begin to step
[1642.82 → 1644.26] little by little
[1644.26 → 1646.18] into loving enemies,
[1646.56 → 1647.40] into being patient
[1647.40 → 1648.08] with the difficult
[1648.08 → 1649.10] members of your church,
[1649.36 → 1650.72] into caring for your leaders,
[1651.10 → 1652.50] et cetera, et cetera.
[1654.48 → 1655.44] Paul even shifts
[1655.44 → 1656.06] his own tone
[1656.06 → 1656.86] in verse 23.
[1656.86 → 1657.78] He stops giving them
[1657.78 → 1658.60] instruction and telling
[1658.60 → 1659.10] them to pray
[1659.10 → 1660.10] to actually praying
[1660.10 → 1660.50] for them.
[1660.86 → 1661.22] And if you know
[1661.22 → 1661.70] the whole book
[1661.70 → 1663.08] of 1 Thessalonians,
[1663.26 → 1664.48] he starts with prayer.
[1664.76 → 1665.68] In the middle of the book,
[1665.72 → 1666.38] he prays for them,
[1666.48 → 1667.64] and he finishes this book
[1667.64 → 1668.04] by saying,
[1668.16 → 1670.14] let me just pray for you.
[1671.54 → 1672.30] In our interview
[1672.30 → 1673.26] with Jim Mullins
[1673.26 → 1674.04] in Phoenix,
[1674.90 → 1675.52] there was a moment
[1675.52 → 1676.62] where he just summarized
[1676.62 → 1677.22] the situation
[1677.22 → 1678.04] he was in Phoenix.
[1678.56 → 1678.76] I mean,
[1678.80 → 1679.46] if we think we've had
[1679.46 → 1680.16] a challenging season,
[1680.24 → 1680.94] just imagine this.
[1681.04 → 1682.14] The year began
[1682.14 → 1683.26] with the coronavirus.
[1683.26 → 1685.02] Then in Phoenix,
[1685.12 → 1687.42] they had massive racial tension
[1687.42 → 1688.56] and riots
[1688.56 → 1689.92] and all sorts of division
[1689.92 → 1690.72] within the church over that.
[1690.84 → 1692.54] Then they had political insanity.
[1693.04 → 1693.38] And again,
[1693.50 → 1694.26] division in the church.
[1694.46 → 1695.22] And then if that was
[1695.22 → 1696.94] as much as they needed,
[1697.22 → 1697.72] then they had
[1697.72 → 1698.76] the longest stretch
[1698.76 → 1699.98] of heat wave in Phoenix
[1699.98 → 1701.56] where for more than 40 days,
[1701.62 → 1703.02] it was more than 40 degrees.
[1703.34 → 1703.82] And it was like
[1703.82 → 1705.00] this pressure cooker
[1705.00 → 1705.90] in the city
[1705.90 → 1706.70] and in the church.
[1706.88 → 1707.76] And then we just asked Jim,
[1707.98 → 1709.30] how in the world
[1709.30 → 1710.50] do you navigate this
[1710.50 → 1711.52] in your church?
[1714.18 → 1715.02] And you know what he said?
[1716.58 → 1716.90] Prayer.
[1718.34 → 1718.86] And he said,
[1718.88 → 1719.78] what we learned actually
[1719.78 → 1720.70] in 2016
[1720.70 → 1721.30] when there was a lot
[1721.30 → 1722.04] of political tension
[1722.04 → 1722.76] the first time around,
[1722.84 → 1723.04] he says,
[1723.10 → 1724.44] we learned that all this
[1724.44 → 1725.32] division and this fighting,
[1725.46 → 1726.48] this was not good for us.
[1726.78 → 1727.74] And we need to do better
[1727.74 → 1728.44] this time around.
[1728.54 → 1729.06] And so they spent
[1729.06 → 1729.76] a whole month
[1729.76 → 1730.72] leading up to the election
[1730.72 → 1733.04] in fasting and prayer.
[1733.66 → 1734.08] And he said,
[1734.16 → 1735.46] that seems to be the thing
[1735.46 → 1736.86] that changed our community
[1736.86 → 1737.82] from four years ago
[1737.82 → 1738.60] to today.
[1738.60 → 1740.42] Maybe he's on to
[1740.42 → 1741.08] the same thing
[1741.08 → 1742.10] Paul's on to
[1742.10 → 1743.38] in our passage.
[1744.74 → 1745.60] I want to read
[1745.60 → 1746.40] what Paul says
[1746.40 → 1747.60] in verse 23.
[1748.30 → 1748.86] You've heard this
[1748.86 → 1749.52] at the end of many
[1749.52 → 1750.10] of our services.
[1750.32 → 1750.68] He writes,
[1751.18 → 1752.10] may God himself,
[1752.22 → 1754.22] the God of peace,
[1754.62 → 1755.34] sanctify you
[1755.34 → 1756.16] through and through.
[1756.52 → 1757.58] May your whole spirit,
[1757.80 → 1758.64] soul, and body
[1758.64 → 1759.48] be kept blameless
[1759.48 → 1760.02] at the coming
[1760.02 → 1761.26] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1761.58 → 1762.60] The one who calls you
[1762.60 → 1763.70] is faithful.
[1764.62 → 1765.62] He will do it.
[1766.70 → 1767.72] At the end of this passage,
[1767.72 → 1768.86] no more instruction
[1768.86 → 1769.54] about how to live.
[1769.74 → 1772.30] It's all about God.
[1773.40 → 1774.60] And Paul knows
[1774.60 → 1775.04] that the church
[1775.04 → 1775.60] has work to do.
[1775.66 → 1776.98] He knows that every church
[1776.98 → 1778.06] will struggle with sin
[1778.06 → 1778.62] and division
[1778.62 → 1779.44] and judgment
[1779.44 → 1780.80] and not caring for one another
[1780.80 → 1781.84] and forgetting about their mission.
[1782.04 → 1782.72] But in the end he says,
[1783.08 → 1783.84] you serve
[1783.84 → 1784.96] and you are in the hands
[1784.96 → 1786.82] of a faithful God.
[1787.14 → 1788.74] And he will hold you
[1788.74 → 1790.20] such that you are blameless
[1790.20 → 1790.64] on the day
[1790.64 → 1791.96] where Jesus Christ returns
[1791.96 → 1793.42] to bring healing
[1793.42 → 1794.88] and renewal to his world.
[1794.88 → 1797.02] Do you see the faithfulness
[1797.02 → 1798.18] of your God?
[1798.94 → 1799.88] That's where he leaves
[1799.88 → 1800.50] the church in the end.
[1800.58 → 1801.50] Grace and peace, church.
[1801.86 → 1803.36] Your God is dependable.
[1803.82 → 1804.70] He's reliable.
[1805.02 → 1805.76] And he'll finish
[1805.76 → 1806.40] what he started
[1806.40 → 1808.36] in his world,
[1809.36 → 1810.66] in his church,
[1811.54 → 1812.46] and in you.
[1813.68 → 1815.00] Grace and peace.
[1815.24 → 1815.50] Amen.
[1816.36 → 1817.00] Let's pray.
[1817.00 → 1817.06] Amen.
[1817.06 → 1817.16] Amen.
[1817.16 → 1817.26] Amen.
[1817.26 → 1817.28] Amen.
[1817.28 → 1817.30] Amen.
[1817.30 → 1817.34] Amen.
[1817.34 → 1817.38] Amen.
[1817.38 → 1817.44] Amen.
[1817.44 → 1817.46] Amen.
[1817.46 → 1817.90] Amen.
[1817.90 → 1817.92] Amen.
[1817.92 → 1817.94] Amen.
[1817.94 → 1818.44] Amen.
[1818.44 → 1819.06] Amen.
[1819.06 → 1819.10] Amen.
[1824.88 → 1825.40] Amen.
[1825.74 → 1826.18] Amen.
[1826.18 → 1826.58] Father, we're just going
[1826.58 → 1827.42] to take a few moments
[1827.42 → 1828.12] in your presence
[1828.12 → 1831.28] to thank you for your goodness,
[1832.46 → 1834.44] to thank you for your patience
[1834.44 → 1835.28] with the church,
[1836.48 → 1838.04] for the way that you don't
[1838.04 → 1839.50] let things fall through the cracks
[1839.50 → 1840.36] and you will finish
[1840.36 → 1841.00] what you started
[1841.00 → 1841.84] for your world,
[1842.58 → 1844.38] for your communities of faith,
[1844.82 → 1845.96] and for us personally.
[1847.70 → 1848.68] And Lord, I pray
[1848.68 → 1849.68] that you would reveal
[1849.68 → 1850.76] to us afresh
[1850.76 → 1854.36] your grace,
[1855.32 → 1856.40] your mercy,
[1857.28 → 1858.62] and the way that you have
[1858.62 → 1859.94] found us in Christ
[1859.94 → 1860.60] on the cross
[1860.60 → 1862.90] and the word spoken over us
[1862.90 → 1864.30] is forgiven.
[1866.20 → 1867.14] Father, I pray
[1867.14 → 1868.10] that this week
[1868.10 → 1870.34] we would have the chance
[1870.34 → 1871.90] to be those who encourage.
[1873.12 → 1874.70] We would seize the opportunity
[1874.70 → 1876.58] to help the weak,
[1877.06 → 1879.32] to speak words of life
[1879.32 → 1880.68] to the disheartened,
[1880.76 → 1881.88] to encourage
[1881.88 → 1883.32] and live in love
[1883.32 → 1884.48] with our brothers and sisters,
[1884.64 → 1885.78] not just in the church,
[1886.50 → 1887.34] but in our city.
[1888.68 → 1889.66] Lord, I pray
[1889.66 → 1891.24] that our very being
[1891.24 → 1893.32] in our homes,
[1894.06 → 1895.10] in our workplaces,
[1895.62 → 1896.56] in our marriages,
[1897.22 → 1898.10] would reveal
[1898.10 → 1900.48] the transformational power
[1900.48 → 1901.28] of the gospel.
[1902.48 → 1903.74] And Lord, I pray
[1903.74 → 1905.06] that you would give us hope
[1905.06 → 1906.28] not just for your return,
[1906.94 → 1908.26] but for what we can do
[1908.26 → 1909.70] as citizens of your kingdom
[1909.70 → 1911.08] in the here and now.
[1911.72 → 1912.38] We pray this
[1912.38 → 1913.10] in the mighty name
[1913.10 → 1913.96] of Jesus Christ.
[1914.68 → 1914.90] Amen.
[1914.90 → 1915.90] Amen.
