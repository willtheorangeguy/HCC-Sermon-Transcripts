[0.00 --> 9.54]  Today, we start a new series called Living in Hope, and we're going to go through Paul's
[9.54 --> 11.06]  letter to the Thessalonians.
[12.22 --> 15.74]  Just a little background to kind of get the context here.
[16.22 --> 21.48]  This was written to a community of believers who had been Christians for a pretty short
[21.48 --> 22.66]  period of time.
[23.94 --> 29.58]  Paul had been sharing the gospel throughout the area, a place like Ephesus and Philippi
[29.58 --> 30.68]  and Corinth and Rome.
[31.58 --> 32.80]  Now, it's Thessalonica.
[34.12 --> 37.12]  The word gospel, too, needs a little bit of understanding.
[37.56 --> 39.10]  Really, it's a political word.
[39.84 --> 41.44]  It literally means good news.
[42.88 --> 46.88]  And the context of the day was the good news was this politically.
[47.42 --> 53.24]  Caesar Augustus has brought you the Pax Romana, the peace of Rome.
[53.80 --> 56.04]  And that's the good news.
[56.30 --> 57.30]  That's the gospel.
[57.30 --> 64.40]  And therefore, you owe him your allegiance because, and here was the phrase, Caesar is
[64.40 --> 64.76]  Lord.
[65.82 --> 68.34]  So that's the gospel of the day.
[69.32 --> 74.94]  And Paul and Silas have come, and they have shared a different story with the people of
[74.94 --> 75.54]  Thessalonica.
[76.10 --> 77.78]  A story of a risen Savior.
[77.78 --> 81.86]  A story that says, Jesus is Lord.
[83.54 --> 87.66]  And he has brought a kingdom of eternal peace.
[89.00 --> 94.58]  Pretty soon, they get accused of defying Caesar with this contrary gospel message.
[95.58 --> 99.52]  Eventually, they flee the city so as not to bring hostility on these new converts.
[99.52 --> 103.42]  Later, Paul's wondering how they're doing.
[103.98 --> 107.58]  And how are these new believers doing back in Thessalonica?
[108.08 --> 110.62]  And so he sends Timothy to check it out.
[110.84 --> 113.74]  Obviously, communication was a slow process, right?
[113.78 --> 116.02]  No phones, no technology.
[116.02 --> 120.18]  And so this involved Timothy walking all the way out there and going to check it out.
[120.24 --> 120.76]  And he does.
[121.56 --> 123.62]  And Timothy goes, and he hangs out for a while there.
[123.70 --> 126.10]  And then he comes back, and he says, you know what?
[126.16 --> 127.34]  They're doing great.
[127.64 --> 128.98]  They're a healthy community.
[130.62 --> 133.72]  And then Paul responds with that with a couple of letters.
[133.90 --> 136.88]  He says, okay, I want to speak to these people here.
[137.12 --> 140.02]  And he writes the letters that we call 1 and 2 Thessalonians.
[140.02 --> 145.82]  Some scholars think this might have been the very first writings of the New Testament.
[146.94 --> 153.08]  Dated about 50 AD, which is not even two decades after Jesus' death and resurrection.
[153.72 --> 156.40]  So there's a little bit of context to kind of hear that in.
[156.86 --> 159.12]  And now we're going to read the first chapter together.
[159.30 --> 162.88]  It's 10 verses, so not particularly long, but now we're into it.
[163.30 --> 164.42]  So let's read this.
[164.42 --> 173.80]  Paul, Silas, and Timothy, to the church of Thessalonians, in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
[173.96 --> 175.44]  grace and peace to you.
[176.40 --> 181.72]  We always thank God for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers.
[182.94 --> 187.02]  We remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith,
[187.02 --> 193.38]  your labor prompted by love, your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[193.38 --> 199.08]  For we know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that He has chosen you.
[199.70 --> 203.36]  Because our gospel came to you not simply with word, but also with power,
[203.80 --> 205.88]  with the Holy Spirit and deep conviction.
[206.88 --> 209.78]  You know how we lived among you for your sake.
[210.12 --> 212.50]  You became imitators of us and of the Lord.
[212.76 --> 215.96]  For you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering,
[216.20 --> 218.42]  with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.
[218.42 --> 223.44]  And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Acacia.
[224.12 --> 227.88]  And the Lord's message rang out from you, not only in Macedonia and Acacia,
[228.32 --> 231.16]  your faith in God has become known everywhere.
[232.40 --> 235.58]  Therefore, we do not need to say anything about it,
[235.84 --> 238.92]  for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us.
[238.92 --> 244.30]  They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living true God
[244.30 --> 248.62]  and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead,
[248.96 --> 252.36]  Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.
[254.54 --> 259.46]  And you see Paul here, as I said, he's been writing to a pretty healthy community.
[260.20 --> 264.40]  This letter isn't a particularly heavy theological one like some of Paul's letters.
[264.40 --> 269.02]  It's really an informal, down-to-earth, upbeat letter.
[269.98 --> 271.00]  He's encouraging them.
[271.74 --> 273.32]  You know, he said, you're doing a great job.
[273.52 --> 274.94]  Now keep growing, keep going.
[275.86 --> 278.72]  And over and over again throughout the book, the letter rather,
[279.08 --> 280.62]  he says this phrase.
[280.70 --> 282.52]  He says, you already know this.
[283.22 --> 284.82]  You get this stuff.
[285.26 --> 286.32]  So keep at it.
[286.40 --> 287.40]  Keep growing, keep going.
[287.40 --> 293.60]  I think this is one of the reasons where Pastor Dave and myself have thought
[293.60 --> 297.00]  this would be a good series for us at Hope Community Church at this time.
[298.26 --> 301.02]  You know, things have been going well at the church.
[302.06 --> 305.58]  I know this time of COVID has made things complicated, but things have gone well.
[305.74 --> 308.52]  I'm not saying perfect, but they've gone well, right?
[308.60 --> 310.22]  We've been growing at the church.
[310.48 --> 312.72]  We have a lot of energy, a lot of good things happening.
[312.84 --> 314.64]  Even the online presence has been really good.
[314.64 --> 318.92]  And so this is something to celebrate, something that we can be grateful for.
[319.60 --> 323.10]  And so we want to say, yeah, yes, let's celebrate that.
[323.24 --> 327.04]  But let's keep moving toward health, toward maturity.
[327.70 --> 332.82]  You know this stuff, to use Paul's words, so live it.
[334.18 --> 334.72]  Live it.
[336.36 --> 339.30]  In verse 7, let me read it to you again.
[339.30 --> 342.42]  He said, you have become a model to all the believers.
[342.42 --> 345.22]  You become a model to all the believers.
[345.62 --> 349.72]  He says this phrase, the gospel message rang out from you.
[350.12 --> 351.34]  It just comes out of you.
[352.12 --> 355.72]  Isn't that what we want to hear as a church?
[357.22 --> 358.62]  Hope Community Church.
[359.12 --> 360.36]  You're a model church.
[361.76 --> 362.82]  We want to hear that.
[363.18 --> 366.52]  And so now continue on that path.
[366.80 --> 368.54]  And Paul writes about that.
[368.54 --> 371.78]  He writes to the Thessalonians and says, this is how you stay on that path.
[371.92 --> 373.74]  And he's saying the same things really to us.
[374.70 --> 381.62]  We want to encourage you, Pastor Dave and myself, to read this letter.
[382.78 --> 384.60]  And what we recommend is this.
[384.82 --> 388.32]  If you would all be, maybe take a time, maybe even today, this evening,
[388.68 --> 391.66]  to read the first Thessalonians, the whole letter.
[391.66 --> 393.06]  It's five chapters.
[393.64 --> 394.68]  Give it, read it through.
[395.04 --> 396.56]  Just start to finish and read it.
[397.14 --> 400.04]  But then every day after that, read one chapter.
[400.88 --> 402.90]  And then pray on that chapter.
[403.46 --> 404.36]  Meditate on it.
[404.82 --> 406.12]  Let it sink in.
[407.32 --> 408.92]  And ask yourself this kind of question.
[409.16 --> 411.26]  How are you hearing it in your life?
[411.52 --> 413.82]  How do you keep going?
[413.82 --> 418.00]  A quick little summary of the letter, right?
[418.12 --> 419.64]  Chapter 1 is kind of an introduction.
[420.14 --> 421.78]  There's this thankfulness and prayer.
[421.96 --> 423.40]  There's gratitude for faith.
[423.84 --> 428.14]  In chapters 2 and 3, Paul's describing his relationship with the people,
[428.56 --> 431.24]  why he left in a hurry, why he hasn't been back.
[431.92 --> 435.66]  And then chapters 4 and 5, well, they get into some issues.
[436.94 --> 441.34]  Being a model church isn't necessarily a church without issues.
[441.84 --> 442.80]  That's still true.
[442.80 --> 445.58]  And so, you know, we all have stuff to work on.
[445.70 --> 446.92]  Paul named some of that.
[447.66 --> 449.16]  What were some of the issues that they dealt with?
[449.28 --> 452.46]  Well, you know, they dealt with issues around sexuality.
[453.40 --> 455.44]  You know, which is really no surprise.
[456.50 --> 460.50]  In the Greek culture, there were tempting places.
[460.78 --> 463.44]  Temple prostitution was a big issue.
[464.24 --> 466.08]  It was common to have a mistress.
[467.78 --> 470.90]  Sexuality was expressed however you felt like it.
[470.90 --> 474.04]  That sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it?
[474.94 --> 478.10]  And then there were some, another issue here, there were some who were lazy.
[478.26 --> 479.46]  They weren't pulling their weight.
[479.66 --> 480.86]  And Paul addresses that.
[481.98 --> 483.96]  And then there were disagreements.
[486.06 --> 488.40]  Ongoing disagreements in the church is nothing new.
[488.72 --> 492.42]  One of the main disagreements they had was around the future and when Christ would return.
[492.42 --> 495.80]  Some of them even thought that Christ had returned and they missed it.
[496.60 --> 498.42]  And so there was some arguing around that.
[498.96 --> 500.86]  Thank goodness we've settled all that.
[500.86 --> 515.48]  But then Paul addresses, so, with all of that in mind, what does it look like to be the people of God in the middle of the messiness of life,
[515.86 --> 521.36]  in the middle of the suffering, and he talks about that, in the middle of all this cultural dynamics,
[521.74 --> 523.28]  what does it mean to be the people of God?
[524.60 --> 525.82]  Idols were common.
[525.82 --> 529.28]  There were many, many gods in this culture.
[529.46 --> 531.16]  There were statues all over the place.
[531.26 --> 531.80]  There were temples.
[532.36 --> 534.60]  Caesar is considered a god.
[534.96 --> 537.08]  That's why you're supposed to call him Lord.
[537.96 --> 541.38]  And then this group of Christians says this,
[542.16 --> 544.46]  Only Jesus is Lord.
[546.66 --> 551.54]  In this culture, transferring your allegiance is costly.
[551.54 --> 555.52]  It affected relationships, employment.
[556.50 --> 558.12]  It often brought hostility.
[559.12 --> 563.02]  In this Greek-Roman culture, they were really heavily into status.
[564.00 --> 565.46]  You had a ranking.
[565.68 --> 566.52]  There were slaves.
[566.86 --> 567.88]  Then you had freemen.
[568.32 --> 569.56]  Then you had equestrians.
[569.86 --> 572.28]  We hear the word about horses, right?
[572.48 --> 574.68]  These were people who owned a horse, which was a status symbol.
[574.76 --> 575.34]  You could ride around.
[575.68 --> 576.58]  And then there was the Senate.
[577.30 --> 579.62]  You know, status showed up in clothes.
[579.62 --> 582.64]  The first example would be only a citizen could wear a toga.
[583.22 --> 585.60]  The freemen had their own special hats to wear.
[585.84 --> 586.60]  I mean, there's all these things.
[586.90 --> 587.66]  Legal rights.
[588.36 --> 590.16]  Citizens couldn't be flogged.
[590.68 --> 591.76]  Everyone else was fine.
[592.86 --> 595.80]  It showed up in what you ate, what parties you went to.
[596.16 --> 598.26]  All of it arranged by status.
[598.26 --> 603.58]  And you don't want to lose status.
[605.64 --> 608.22]  The process of losing status was named.
[608.30 --> 610.14]  It was called being humbled.
[611.10 --> 611.76]  Being humbled.
[612.48 --> 613.78]  Nobody wanted that.
[615.20 --> 617.00]  I'm going to read you a quote from Pliny.
[617.74 --> 620.26]  He's an ancient Roman scholar.
[620.52 --> 621.76]  And he said this, and I quote,
[621.76 --> 630.58]  It is more uglifying to lose praise, to go down than never to have been praised at all.
[634.06 --> 637.96]  This idea of status is hugely, hugely important.
[638.46 --> 640.24]  Fortunately, we have no issues with that, right?
[640.24 --> 644.36]  And Paul says, we follow Jesus.
[644.64 --> 645.90]  Jesus is Lord.
[646.64 --> 650.36]  The one who made himself nothing.
[651.70 --> 653.34]  Imagine this culture hearing that.
[653.82 --> 657.46]  The one who took the very nature of a servant.
[658.54 --> 659.70]  And you're going, what?
[659.96 --> 661.62]  Could the worst thing of being humbled in this?
[662.28 --> 666.22]  And he, the Lord, Scripture says, humbled himself.
[666.22 --> 670.46]  Minds blown.
[671.70 --> 673.34]  He humbled himself.
[673.86 --> 675.60]  Nobody would do that.
[675.90 --> 677.08]  And he is Lord.
[677.50 --> 680.68]  And this kingdom of God breaks into the Roman world.
[681.08 --> 683.48]  And then ironically, how does it affect the culture?
[683.84 --> 687.88]  Well, when we read it in verse 6 here, he says this.
[688.04 --> 691.02]  And you see, you became imitators of us and of the Lord.
[691.30 --> 692.42]  For you welcomed the message.
[692.42 --> 698.06]  And now here, in the midst of severe suffering, with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.
[699.62 --> 704.76]  So there's all this suffering going on, but they have joy in this story.
[705.68 --> 710.72]  And these joyful followers of Jesus learn that power comes through surrender.
[711.40 --> 714.46]  And it comes through the Spirit and the Spirit's power.
[714.46 --> 719.96]  Joy comes not through indulging my sinful self, but dying to self.
[722.10 --> 729.38]  This gospel comes to a people in their time and their place, as it does to us.
[731.38 --> 735.68]  A gospel that is so much more than just about getting to heaven.
[735.96 --> 737.96]  That's part of it, but it's just so much more than that.
[737.96 --> 740.64]  It's so much more than a bunch of good advice.
[740.74 --> 741.68]  It does give good advice.
[742.04 --> 745.12]  But it hinges, this gospel hinges on an event.
[746.06 --> 752.56]  Jesus of Nazareth was crucified and he arose and he reigns.
[754.24 --> 755.16]  He reigns.
[756.04 --> 756.90]  He is Lord of Lords.
[758.18 --> 761.32]  And the world, because of that, is not the same.
[761.32 --> 767.60]  I'm going to describe this then as the fulcrum of history.
[768.38 --> 770.64]  The fulcrum is when everything balances on.
[771.24 --> 773.62]  It's not the Pax Romana.
[774.30 --> 776.30]  An empire, by the way, that would soon crumble.
[776.64 --> 778.26]  People didn't know it at the time, but it would.
[779.08 --> 785.64]  No, the kingdom of God comes and Jesus is Lord and he establishes an eternal kingdom.
[786.70 --> 787.94]  And that's the gospel story.
[787.94 --> 795.18]  In our time, many want to make the fulcrum of history about the rise of science, for example.
[795.36 --> 798.70]  Or rise of technology or Western democracy.
[799.20 --> 801.58]  You know, we say, well, those are Lord.
[802.56 --> 804.18]  Those are tools.
[805.02 --> 807.02]  Those are maybe valuable in many ways.
[807.22 --> 808.62]  But that's not the Lord.
[808.68 --> 809.88]  We say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[810.20 --> 811.36]  Yes, those things matter.
[811.64 --> 813.08]  But Jesus is Lord.
[814.34 --> 815.60]  And only him.
[816.46 --> 819.26]  And then we understand those things in the context of his lordship.
[820.06 --> 821.60]  He is the fulcrum.
[822.08 --> 822.76]  Nothing else.
[825.96 --> 828.98]  Let me read in verses 9 and 10.
[830.14 --> 832.50]  We read there where it says,
[832.50 --> 838.32]  And they tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living God.
[838.66 --> 841.92]  And then wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead.
[841.98 --> 844.20]  Jesus who rescues us from the coming wrath.
[845.92 --> 853.18]  And I love this combination there of you turn from idols and then you wait.
[853.92 --> 855.56]  And this is active waiting.
[855.96 --> 858.46]  We could talk a whole lot about what it is to wait.
[858.46 --> 860.90]  That's kind of, we talk a lot about that at Advent.
[861.14 --> 862.24]  We'll probably get into that more then.
[862.44 --> 865.54]  But, you know, we wait with activity here.
[866.48 --> 872.02]  And he will return to restore and renew and transform and heal all things.
[872.58 --> 874.14]  Where there will be no more evil then.
[874.20 --> 875.10]  And there will be no more death.
[875.16 --> 876.28]  And there will be forever peace.
[876.28 --> 880.98]  But that renewal has begun and is ongoing and we are part of it.
[882.44 --> 892.12]  And the gospel is built on the past event of Jesus' death and resurrection and his kingdom come and his kingdom coming.
[892.12 --> 898.80]  It is also a gospel that is built on the future hope of what is to come.
[899.32 --> 900.44]  The kingdom fulfilled.
[900.58 --> 902.18]  And we sit in between those two.
[902.46 --> 906.46]  It is also a gospel that is for now in our time and place.
[906.56 --> 908.88]  That's why Paul writes this letter to a time and a place.
[909.26 --> 910.58]  The kingdom of God at hand.
[910.94 --> 912.90]  The kingdom up to something right now.
[913.04 --> 913.90]  In our lives.
[913.98 --> 914.62]  In your life.
[914.68 --> 915.24]  In my life.
[915.50 --> 916.58]  To our world.
[916.58 --> 923.34]  The Holy Spirit empowering us right now to live the gospel now.
[923.48 --> 924.88]  To seek justice now.
[925.20 --> 926.04]  Healing now.
[926.32 --> 927.26]  Restoration now.
[927.62 --> 928.38]  Freedom now.
[928.70 --> 929.68]  Peace now.
[931.52 --> 932.88]  Not idyllically.
[933.36 --> 934.42]  But in process.
[935.98 --> 939.14]  So we work while we wait.
[940.50 --> 942.24]  For the kingdom to come in its fullness.
[942.60 --> 944.08]  We anticipate more and more and more.
[945.04 --> 945.72]  One writer said,
[945.72 --> 946.36]  In a sense,
[946.54 --> 947.88]  We are a picture of the future.
[948.70 --> 950.30]  I like that image.
[950.82 --> 955.36]  You and I as a church are a picture of what is to come.
[956.76 --> 959.68]  A model of what is to come.
[960.70 --> 962.24]  We live in the in between, right?
[962.32 --> 968.22]  We live right now with all the chaos and the brokenness of the world and yet all the promises of God.
[968.62 --> 972.80]  We live with hope in the midst of a lot of disappointments too.
[972.80 --> 976.56]  But we live where hope prevails.
[976.56 --> 981.32]  We are a people of now and a people of the future.
[981.70 --> 983.86]  As the series is called, A Living Hope.
[985.86 --> 988.12]  And then we say, this is what God is doing.
[988.48 --> 989.72]  Or that's what God is doing.
[989.92 --> 992.58]  That is a snapshot of what is to come.
[992.66 --> 993.84]  What is and is to come.
[993.84 --> 997.78]  I really like how Paul said it elsewhere in Romans 8.
[997.90 --> 998.58]  Look at it with me.
[999.16 --> 1001.02]  Romans 8 out of the New Living Translation.
[1001.86 --> 1003.10]  I love how he just starts off.
[1003.30 --> 1005.68]  And we believers also groan.
[1008.24 --> 1009.20]  I'm going to stop there.
[1010.74 --> 1011.90]  You know, I groan.
[1012.66 --> 1014.02]  I'm in some pain.
[1015.50 --> 1017.96]  You know, I groan with my own personal brokenness.
[1017.96 --> 1020.66]  I might groan with some brokenness in my marriage.
[1020.90 --> 1022.64]  I might groan because of COVID.
[1022.94 --> 1025.54]  I might groan because there's war or famine.
[1025.82 --> 1027.76]  I might groan because there's disharmony.
[1028.04 --> 1029.58]  I might groan because of injustice.
[1031.36 --> 1033.90]  It's like, oh, it hurts.
[1035.06 --> 1035.18]  Right?
[1035.24 --> 1036.28]  So there, Paul starts there.
[1036.36 --> 1038.74]  So there we are in time and place.
[1038.98 --> 1039.80]  I groan.
[1039.80 --> 1042.18]  But then he goes on.
[1042.36 --> 1047.40]  Even though we have the Holy Spirit within us as a foretaste of future glory.
[1047.50 --> 1048.16]  Isn't that beautiful?
[1048.50 --> 1049.66]  It's a foretaste.
[1049.98 --> 1052.66]  We are an appetizer of the kingdom to come.
[1054.92 --> 1055.74]  A foretaste.
[1056.06 --> 1060.02]  For we longed for our bodies to be released from sin and suffering.
[1060.52 --> 1062.32]  Our bodies and everything else around us.
[1062.66 --> 1064.74]  We too wait with eager hope.
[1064.86 --> 1065.70]  Isn't that wonderful?
[1066.00 --> 1066.46]  We wait.
[1066.52 --> 1066.74]  How?
[1066.94 --> 1068.12]  With eager hope.
[1068.12 --> 1073.52]  Not like we're standing in some line and impatient for the line to go away.
[1073.88 --> 1074.12]  No, no.
[1074.18 --> 1078.18]  We wait with eager hope because we keep the hope of Christ in front of us.
[1079.38 --> 1083.84]  We wait with eager hope for the day when God will give us our full rights as his adopted children.
[1084.14 --> 1086.94]  Including the new bodies that he has promised us and a new creation as well.
[1090.14 --> 1091.42]  Hope Community Church.
[1092.04 --> 1093.80]  When people look at us.
[1094.08 --> 1097.26]  They ought to get a glimpse of what the kingdom is like.
[1098.12 --> 1099.98]  Or it could be like.
[1100.94 --> 1102.20]  Not perfectly, right?
[1102.24 --> 1102.76]  We get that.
[1102.84 --> 1103.48]  That's why we groan.
[1103.48 --> 1104.56]  But hopefully.
[1104.56 --> 1104.58]  But hopefully.
[1106.08 --> 1109.18]  This is what marriage can look like.
[1111.54 --> 1114.82]  You still catch me on a bad day, but this is what marriage can look like.
[1115.64 --> 1119.56]  This is what can happen to brokenness.
[1119.96 --> 1121.12]  Where there can be renewal.
[1121.30 --> 1122.18]  There can be healing.
[1122.18 --> 1126.48]  This is what can happen to when there's tons of tension.
[1126.48 --> 1129.52]  We can overcome it somehow with peace.
[1129.94 --> 1131.52]  This is where justice prevails.
[1131.82 --> 1133.06]  Where creation is healed.
[1133.36 --> 1135.18]  Where forgiveness triumphs over blame.
[1135.52 --> 1137.92]  Where freedom from addiction happens.
[1137.92 --> 1142.16]  And we celebrate that.
[1144.16 --> 1145.28]  In Thessalonica.
[1146.62 --> 1148.36]  You know, you're modeling that there, Paul says.
[1148.42 --> 1149.44]  In Hope Community Church.
[1149.68 --> 1150.98]  You're modeling that.
[1151.06 --> 1152.32]  Yeah, I know not perfectly.
[1152.32 --> 1156.92]  I know we all can have times where we feel disappointed even in churches.
[1157.18 --> 1158.32]  And there's lots of stories about them.
[1158.36 --> 1158.92]  And that's sad.
[1159.00 --> 1159.74]  And that breaks my heart.
[1160.14 --> 1161.94]  But we're full of the Spirit's power.
[1162.20 --> 1163.26]  Full of the Spirit's activity.
[1163.62 --> 1165.28]  Moving towards something hopeful.
[1166.86 --> 1168.86]  We're imitators of Jesus Christ.
[1169.50 --> 1171.66]  And your joy comes from the Spirit.
[1172.00 --> 1174.14]  Not merely through your circumstances.
[1178.62 --> 1179.68]  You're holy people.
[1179.68 --> 1182.22]  Yeah, you're set apart to be in the midst.
[1183.42 --> 1184.58]  You're a sanctified people.
[1184.66 --> 1185.40]  I said last week.
[1185.46 --> 1185.56]  Right?
[1185.60 --> 1186.08]  What does that mean?
[1186.28 --> 1186.88]  Well, you're humble.
[1187.00 --> 1187.34]  You're gentle.
[1187.42 --> 1187.82]  You're patient.
[1187.92 --> 1188.92]  You bear one another in love.
[1189.40 --> 1191.22]  Not driven by your wants.
[1191.56 --> 1192.62]  Or your passions.
[1192.74 --> 1193.38]  Or your lust.
[1193.64 --> 1195.10]  Or your brokenness and hurts.
[1195.52 --> 1196.42]  Not lazy.
[1196.54 --> 1198.38]  But wanting to contribute and produce.
[1198.70 --> 1201.32]  And use your God-given gifts and talents and resources.
[1201.62 --> 1202.58]  For the good of others.
[1203.52 --> 1206.64]  A people living in the kingdom community.
[1206.86 --> 1208.62]  With love and peace and joy.
[1208.62 --> 1209.94]  And yes, forgiveness.
[1210.08 --> 1211.52]  Because we don't do it flawlessly.
[1212.94 --> 1215.18]  We're learning to work together.
[1216.10 --> 1219.00]  We're learning to pay attention to those around us.
[1219.66 --> 1221.24]  We need lots of patience.
[1221.38 --> 1222.12]  Lots of grace.
[1222.36 --> 1223.84]  Because we drop the ball sometimes.
[1224.24 --> 1226.16]  And that should make us sad as a community.
[1226.46 --> 1229.12]  But we also celebrate the triumph of community.
[1229.42 --> 1230.66]  Not triumphalism.
[1231.04 --> 1233.54]  But the triumph of Christ's work in us and through us.
[1233.54 --> 1235.56]  We do life together.
[1236.84 --> 1238.32]  Waiting for Christ to return.
[1238.94 --> 1241.98]  Working for the kingdom that has come and is coming.
[1242.38 --> 1243.98]  Showing the world what the future can look like.
[1247.40 --> 1248.62]  So people of hope.
[1249.96 --> 1251.02]  Let me ask you.
[1252.06 --> 1253.42]  Where is your life?
[1254.36 --> 1256.16]  A picture of the future kingdom come.
[1256.16 --> 1259.26]  And just think about that.
[1261.08 --> 1263.42]  And then like Paul, I say, you know, keep going.
[1264.30 --> 1265.32]  You know this stuff.
[1265.78 --> 1266.50]  Keep doing that.
[1268.12 --> 1273.62]  But let me also ask, where is your life not embodying the future kingdom?
[1275.80 --> 1278.26]  And I think we all have examples of those moments too.
[1279.70 --> 1280.60]  Repent of that.
[1280.60 --> 1283.20]  And seek the spirit's power.
[1284.00 --> 1285.84]  To move in a better direction.
[1289.52 --> 1290.76]  Like in Thessalonians.
[1291.28 --> 1292.28]  You know, Caesar is Lord.
[1292.68 --> 1295.30]  The world around us is saying those kind of things too.
[1295.38 --> 1296.86]  And say, well, this is Lord.
[1297.02 --> 1297.80]  That is Lord.
[1298.02 --> 1298.94]  I think a common one.
[1299.18 --> 1300.70]  You are your own Lord.
[1303.10 --> 1304.22]  And we know the truth.
[1304.76 --> 1305.50]  Jesus is Lord.
[1307.62 --> 1309.88]  And our hope is in him.
[1311.38 --> 1312.72]  Not in our brilliance.
[1313.76 --> 1314.44]  In him.
[1315.80 --> 1317.50]  And we put aside idols.
[1318.46 --> 1320.22]  Which isn't a one-shot deal.
[1320.30 --> 1321.52]  Because I put aside idols.
[1322.02 --> 1323.54]  And then I focus on the Lord.
[1324.00 --> 1326.46]  And then over time, I sometimes get drawn back to the idol.
[1326.56 --> 1327.58]  And I pick it up again.
[1327.64 --> 1329.00]  And say, oh, what a beautiful idol.
[1329.44 --> 1331.06]  And then, you know, I have to learn to put it down.
[1331.12 --> 1331.78]  Say, Lord, sorry.
[1331.90 --> 1333.22]  I picked up that stupid idol again.
[1333.28 --> 1333.70]  Forgive me.
[1336.60 --> 1337.80]  We put down the idols.
[1338.04 --> 1339.30]  We turn away from the idols.
[1339.30 --> 1341.40]  And we focus on Jesus.
[1342.02 --> 1343.50]  Jesus who has overcome sin.
[1343.58 --> 1344.56]  Who has overcome death.
[1344.94 --> 1347.34]  We don't even have to fear death.
[1347.44 --> 1349.38]  I know it's a thing.
[1349.74 --> 1352.96]  You know, it's so sad to hear 200,000 plus dead.
[1353.10 --> 1354.46]  You know, what a sad, sad story.
[1354.46 --> 1358.92]  But we don't have to live in cynicism that there's no ultimate purpose.
[1359.74 --> 1360.98]  That death wins in the end.
[1361.22 --> 1362.46]  Even Jesus will overcome that.
[1362.70 --> 1363.94]  Yeah, there's plenty of struggles.
[1364.08 --> 1366.98]  There's plenty of issues in our lives and in the world around us.
[1366.98 --> 1370.26]  But that's not how the story ends.
[1374.50 --> 1375.82]  So we look forward.
[1377.38 --> 1378.86]  We have a living hope.
[1379.84 --> 1381.44]  Because there's ongoing renewal.
[1381.64 --> 1383.52]  And the restoration of all things is yet to come.
[1384.40 --> 1388.42]  So, again, where is God calling you right now to embody the future?
[1388.42 --> 1393.58]  And to trust in this work of the Spirit to empower you to live out the kingdom come.
[1394.54 --> 1396.48]  And to show a picture of the kingdom yet to come.
[1398.32 --> 1398.92]  Let's pray.
[1402.24 --> 1404.14]  Father God, we come before you.
[1404.30 --> 1407.90]  And we are so grateful that you are a God who has come to us.
[1408.92 --> 1409.96]  You have created us.
[1409.96 --> 1412.98]  And then the brokenness happened.
[1413.88 --> 1415.02]  And you sent your Son.
[1415.62 --> 1417.28]  And you created a way forward.
[1417.64 --> 1419.70]  A way to restore and renew.
[1420.04 --> 1422.68]  A way for healing and hope to come yet again.
[1422.96 --> 1425.08]  A way where death and sin don't win.
[1425.46 --> 1426.06]  But you do.
[1426.12 --> 1426.90]  And you are Lord.
[1427.90 --> 1430.78]  Lord, may we hold you in Lordship all the time.
[1430.82 --> 1432.56]  And when we don't, may we repent.
[1433.30 --> 1434.50]  And turn yet again to you.
[1435.08 --> 1438.08]  We thank you, Lord, that you are our Lord.
[1438.26 --> 1439.06]  And you are our God.
[1439.96 --> 1440.98]  And that we are your people.
[1441.86 --> 1444.56]  Help us, Lord, to be a snapshot of what is yet to come.
[1444.96 --> 1445.76]  In Jesus' name.
[1446.24 --> 1446.46]  Amen.
[1453.78 --> 1455.18]  We're going to sing in response.
[1455.30 --> 1455.92]  Thank you, Sid.
[1456.70 --> 1457.80]  You're welcome to stand.
[1457.80 --> 1457.86]  Thank you.
[1469.96 --> 1482.28]  How great the chasm that lay between us.
[1482.28 --> 1489.08]  How high the mountain I could not climb.
[1489.08 --> 1496.64]  In desperation, I turned to heaven.
[1496.64 --> 1503.82]  And spoke your name into the night.
[1503.82 --> 1518.40]  Then through the darkness, your loving kindness tore through the shadows of my soul.
[1519.08 --> 1521.08]  The work is finished.
[1521.08 --> 1523.14]  The work is finished.
[1523.14 --> 1526.54]  The end is written.
[1526.54 --> 1533.74]  Jesus Christ, my very hope.
[1533.74 --> 1545.06]  Who could imagine so great a mercy.
[1545.06 --> 1552.66]  What our good fellow, such boundless grace.
[1552.66 --> 1553.66]  The God of the world, such boundless grace.
[1553.66 --> 1557.66]  The God of the world, such boundless grace.
[1557.66 --> 1559.70]  The grace of God, says it is indeed.
[1559.70 --> 1563.76]  Now, the zal HIji hall, such about Ele clicking on it.
[1563.76 --> 1563.96]  Mypit or his love is already visto.
[1563.96 --> 1565.66]  And if it's all this boundless Christ is произошed.
[1565.66 --> 1567.20]  But if it exists because of his love comes, he harms me.
[1567.20 --> 1568.06]  Theat Hanson Bible, such that love, so great, theyヒal.
[1568.06 --> 1581.06]  The cross has fallen, my beautiful feet, the peace of me is all.
[1581.06 --> 1595.06]  Beautiful Savior, I'm yours forever, Jesus Christ, my name.
[1595.06 --> 1603.06]  Hallelujah, praise the one who sets me free.
[1603.06 --> 1610.06]  Hallelujah, you have lost it before me.
[1610.06 --> 1617.06]  You have lost it every day, your salvation in heaven.
[1617.06 --> 1624.06]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1624.06 --> 1634.06]  Then came the morning that sealed the promise.
[1634.06 --> 1642.06]  Your very body began to breathe.
[1642.06 --> 1656.06]  Out of the silence the roaring lion declared the grave has no claim on me.
[1656.06 --> 1686.06] 
[1686.06 --> 1696.06]  The cross has fallen, my beautiful feet, the peace of me.
[1696.06 --> 1699.06]  There's no one who set me free.
[1699.06 --> 1706.06]  Hallelujah, there has lost it before me.
[1706.06 --> 1713.06]  You have broken every day, your salvation in your name.
[1713.06 --> 1719.06]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1719.06 --> 1723.06]  Hallelujah, oh hallelujah.
[1723.06 --> 1727.06]  Praise the one who set me free.
[1727.06 --> 1733.06]  Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me.
[1733.06 --> 1743.06]  You have broken every day, your salvation in your name.
[1743.06 --> 1747.06]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1747.06 --> 1753.06]  Oh, Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1753.06 --> 1757.06]  Oh, God, you love, my living hope.
[1757.06 --> 1769.06]  Jesus Christ, my living hope.
[1769.06 --> 1773.06]  Isn't that encouraging?
[1773.06 --> 1779.06]  I want to read you a blessing.
[1779.06 --> 1789.06]  Lord, send the gift of your spirit to fill this place and these people and your world.
[1789.06 --> 1795.06]  Touch us with truth that burns like fire, with beauty that moves like the wind.
[1795.06 --> 1818.06]  And set us free, Lord, free to try new ways of living, free to forgive myself and others, free to love and laugh and sing, free to lay aside my burdens of security, free to join the battle for justice and peace, free to see and listen and wonder again at the gracious mystery of things and persons, free to be, free to give, free to receive, to rejoice.
[1818.06 --> 1823.06]  And that's the gift of God, free to rejoice as a child of your spirit.
[1823.06 --> 1830.06]  People of God, go live your life in that spirit's power and display the kingdom come and coming.
[1830.06 --> 1831.06]  Amen.
[1831.06 --> 1833.06]  Enjoy your day.
[1833.06 --> 1834.06]  God bless.
[1834.06 --> 1835.06]  Amen.
[1835.06 --> 1836.06]  Amen.
[1836.06 --> 1837.06]  Amen.
[1837.06 --> 1838.06]  Amen.
[1838.06 --> 1839.06]  Amen.
[1839.06 --> 1840.06]  Amen.
[1840.06 --> 1841.06]  Amen.
[1841.06 --> 1842.06]  Amen.
[1842.06 --> 1843.06]  Amen.
[1843.06 --> 1844.06]  Amen.
[1844.06 --> 1845.06]  Amen.
[1845.06 --> 1846.06]  Amen.
[1846.06 --> 1847.06]  Amen.
[1847.06 --> 1848.06]  Amen.
