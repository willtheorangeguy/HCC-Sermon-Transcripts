[0.00 → 19.04] I'm just so thankful that I can testify to God's love and goodness in my life.
[19.04 → 25.92] You know, going through something like cancer and radiation treatments,
[25.92 → 31.84] it just gives you a realization for the many blessings that we have.
[31.84 → 37.44] You know, the love of family, the community that we are surrounded by.
[40.24 → 44.08] You know, my wonderful husband, Harold, who, you know, is just such a rock.
[45.04 → 47.36] There are so many blessings that we take for granted.
[50.00 → 55.52] When rubber hits the road, they're the things that really hold you up.
[56.48 → 56.80] Yeah.
[59.04 → 62.56] Well, just I'm thankful to be given the opportunity to talk about it.
[64.24 → 73.04] Thankful for my place here in Clayton and all the blessings that God continues to shower on
[73.68 → 79.84] myself and my family. It's really overwhelming. I mean, my wife and I talk about
[79.84 → 88.88] just how incredibly wealthy we are in terms of friends and family and providence and God,
[89.84 → 96.56] you know, throwing up the lamp for our journey kind of thing. So I'm probably just most grateful for that.
[96.56 → 107.68] But ultimately, when I step back, I'm grateful for this truth that he's bigger and in control than
[108.24 → 117.68] than anything that's brewing, you know, kind of thing in our culture. So yeah, that's that's my gratitude.
[117.68 → 118.24] I'm thankful for that.
[118.24 → 125.68] I'm thankful for that. I have a church community and a youth community that I can
[127.20 → 129.52] worship God with people and
[129.52 → 136.16] get encouragement from them. And yeah, it's great to have this community.
[136.16 → 142.08] What I'm most grateful and thankful for at this time in my life is
[142.08 → 151.84] my family, and it's all encompassing, you know, good health and then there's peace. In my marriage,
[151.84 → 159.76] I cannot, you know, there's usually, you usually have the ups and downs, but, you know,
[160.72 → 162.56] we always find a way to sort it out.
[162.56 → 171.44] I have seen in my home, in my family, I have seen God work in ways that I know that
[172.00 → 175.76] if it hadn't been him, you know, things would have gone south.
[175.76 → 186.08] I really thank God for this moment. Just let me learn about my weakness and let me agree
[186.08 → 193.12] with God and agree that I have it and I have to deal with the problem. So
[195.84 → 204.96] I'm adult, but before God, I'm still growing up. So yeah, that part is amazing.
[207.12 → 211.92] What am I most thankful for? I would say I am most thankful for
[211.92 → 224.64] honestly everything. I'm really lucky. Furthermore, I mean, my family, we go and we, even at my school,
[224.64 → 229.84] it's always about serving. It's about servant leadership. It's about, you know what, we've been
[229.84 → 237.60] blessed, but we're only a few questions or a few decisions different from somebody who we meet on
[237.60 → 246.00] the street. So the fact that we're given much, we should be expected to do much. I don't know if
[246.00 → 253.52] that makes any sense, but yeah, I just really want to have it where at the end of the day,
[255.12 → 260.08] nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care. And I just want people to know how
[260.08 → 267.04] much their story doesn't scare me and their story, I want to be a part of it if I can. And if not,
[267.04 → 272.32] just silently walk beside them. But I have a hard time being silent anyway. So let's be honest,
[272.32 → 274.32] I just want to walk and have some good times with them.
[276.80 → 283.12] From where we were three years ago, because the 19th of this month, we make it three years,
[283.12 → 289.28] we arrived Canada from Nigeria. So from where we're coming from and from where we are right now,
[289.28 → 295.44] like I can't even start to talk about in this short period, these three years, we've achieved a lot.
[295.44 → 302.72] We've seen, you know, amazing, great things happen in our life. Just a year ago, we bought our first
[302.72 → 310.88] home in Canada. And that was just less than two years we were here. So for me, that's like,
[310.88 → 315.12] because when we first came, someone actually told me, you guys, if you're thinking to get a home,
[315.12 → 321.36] to buy a home, you are in your wrong promise. So I remember telling Pastor Dave, just watch me,
[321.36 → 326.96] we'll do it. I wasn't really relying on my strength, on what I can do or what I can do.
[327.92 → 330.88] I was absolutely relying on God's grace and faithfulness.
[331.44 → 337.84] Yeah, for Thanksgiving, I'm truly thankful for my health and for my family, of course. But if I
[337.84 → 342.88] really think about it, I think about all the wonderful people that I have in my life and that
[342.88 → 349.28] I have encountered in my life. I love how God has wired us all differently and made us all uniquely.
[349.84 → 355.84] And I just love meeting new people. And I'm just so thankful for all the people in my life,
[355.84 → 363.44] for just the broad spectrum and diversity of personalities that I get to enjoy life with. It's great.
[363.44 → 376.40] Thank you.
[380.00 → 383.84] Hello, Hope Community Church. My name is Mingy Kim. Shall we pray together?
[383.84 → 397.20] We give thanks and praise to God you saved us who died in sin and guilty through Jesus Christ.
[398.00 → 405.76] You made us your children, and thank you for letting us go to heaven on our last day in this world,
[406.56 → 409.20] because you have promised us eternal life.
[409.20 → 414.24] You made us your children, and thank you for letting us know that we are here today.
[414.24 → 416.32] And we are here today.
[417.92 → 421.68] There is another reason for gratitude to Heavenly Father.
[423.04 → 431.68] Over the past year, you have reaped a lot from our lives, because you have given us many opportunities.
[432.80 → 438.08] Sometimes the results were good, sometimes they were ugly,
[438.08 → 441.04] especially at this time of the pandemic.
[442.08 → 448.80] But what we are most grateful to God is that you have never left us,
[449.44 → 458.72] and you have been with us under any circumstance when we were sad, happy, hurt, or thankful.
[458.72 → 470.68] So we have lived up to now without any disappointment in all situations and without giving up because of you, my Lord.
[471.68 → 474.12] There is another reason to thank God.
[474.70 → 477.14] We thank God for making us a church.
[478.00 → 481.36] We thank God for giving us faithful God's workers,
[481.94 → 486.96] like pastors, elders, deacons, readers, and other volunteers.
[486.96 → 494.62] We thank you for allowing us to use our strength and power to serve your church.
[495.96 → 500.46] Now we are in front of you, in front of your word.
[501.16 → 508.30] When we listen to God, the Holy Spirit makes us understand the word of God well.
[508.30 → 518.22] Let us try to renew our hearts and change our lives so that we can live a life that pleases God.
[518.90 → 522.08] In the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.
[522.08 → 534.12] Well, good morning, Hope.
[535.26 → 536.26] Welcome to worship.
[536.82 → 539.16] It's good to gather around the word this morning.
[539.92 → 543.82] When Pastor Sid and I met to talk about our fall preaching series,
[543.98 → 546.92] we decided pretty quickly we're going to do a Thanksgiving service.
[546.92 → 551.30] Perhaps this is the most important season to do a Thanksgiving service in,
[551.40 → 555.08] more important than many others for the reasons of the season we're in.
[556.12 → 559.24] I want to thank also those of you who are doing that interview.
[559.38 → 562.80] That was just beautiful, and it helps us again to see from a variety of perspectives
[562.80 → 564.46] the goodness of God in this season.
[564.46 → 568.10] I'm going to continue our series in Thessalonians,
[568.26 → 572.20] and I'm actually going to preach on the same passage that Pastor Sid preached on last week
[572.20 → 574.14] because he didn't do a good enough job.
[574.88 → 575.68] I'm just kidding.
[576.06 → 576.92] I'm going to focus.
[577.38 → 578.60] His wife is looking at me.
[578.70 → 579.46] I'm just joking.
[579.52 → 580.18] I really am.
[581.54 → 584.82] I'm going to preach on the Thanksgiving at the beginning of our book,
[585.06 → 588.08] and so if you have your Bible, turn with me to 1 Thessalonians 1.
[588.48 → 590.28] We're going to be reading verse 2 and 3.
[590.28 → 590.34] Verse 2.
[594.46 → 602.96] We always thank God for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers.
[603.72 → 607.98] We remember you before our God and Father, your work produced by faith,
[608.66 → 610.68] your labour prompted by love,
[611.10 → 616.58] and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[616.58 → 628.08] I want to begin this morning with a story about a man named Matthew Henry.
[629.16 → 633.84] Matthew Henry is a well-known pastor in the 17th century, and he's a well-known writer.
[634.00 → 637.54] In fact, many pastors still have his commentaries on their shelves.
[637.62 → 639.02] He wrote many commentaries on the Scriptures.
[639.94 → 643.72] And in his own life, at one point, he was walking home in the evening, and he was mugged.
[643.72 → 646.62] And the people who mugged him took all of his belongings.
[646.78 → 649.90] He had a little bag, and that was all of his money at the time.
[650.06 → 654.70] And so he was experiencing a significant amount of frustration and grief over that theft.
[655.54 → 660.78] The evening of that mugging, he wrote in his journal, and I want to read for you what he wrote that night.
[661.82 → 662.60] He writes,
[662.72 → 667.54] Let me be thankful first, because I was never robbed before.
[668.66 → 672.52] Second, because although they took my purse, they did not take my life.
[672.52 → 676.84] Third, because although they took my all, it was not much.
[677.42 → 681.62] And fourth, because it was I who was robbed and not I who robbed.
[683.58 → 686.26] Let me be thankful.
[687.54 → 694.50] Now, I don't think I need to convince anyone today that this is not a season marked by gratitude or Thanksgiving in any measure.
[695.18 → 698.04] In fact, I happen to think it's the opposite right now.
[698.04 → 699.62] There's a lot of frustration.
[700.14 → 701.30] There's a lot of exhaustion.
[701.84 → 708.00] There's a lot of people who are at the end of themselves as this pandemic goes on and all the stuff that's happening in our culture around us.
[708.34 → 709.20] There's exhaustion.
[710.00 → 717.32] And it seems that no matter what conversation you're in, it's only a matter of minutes before it slides into complaining about COVID-19.
[718.18 → 718.82] Have you noticed that?
[719.78 → 720.92] Have you been that person?
[720.92 → 724.68] Or it slides into ranting about American politics.
[724.76 → 725.42] Have you done that?
[726.68 → 726.96] Yeah?
[727.18 → 727.94] Canadian politics?
[728.72 → 736.42] Or perhaps ranting or venting about some social media post that triggers you about any one of the aforementioned issues going on in our culture.
[736.42 → 740.56] I feel like people are on edge right now.
[741.10 → 742.08] Present company included.
[742.56 → 743.88] We're quick to complain.
[744.08 → 745.12] We're quick to grumble.
[745.28 → 747.86] We're quick to snap even at people close to us that we love.
[748.18 → 748.92] We're on edge.
[749.90 → 750.78] Have you noticed that?
[751.54 → 755.68] In your workplace, perhaps your family, your neighbourhood, and in yourself.
[756.42 → 759.44] I mean, is gratitude something that's going on in your life?
[759.66 → 762.50] Is that what people would describe when they talk about your character right now?
[762.54 → 763.12] They're grateful.
[764.12 → 765.32] It's a tough season for it.
[765.32 → 770.54] Paul begins his letter to the Thessalonians with Thanksgiving.
[771.10 → 773.64] Deep, heartfelt Thanksgiving.
[774.10 → 780.38] And what's striking, if you know Paul's letters, he does this in almost every single letter he writes.
[781.12 → 782.22] And that's significant.
[782.80 → 787.72] If you know some of the churches Paul's writing to, like Corinthians, they're a bit of a mess.
[788.42 → 790.18] Corinthians were struggling with all sorts of things.
[790.26 → 791.72] They had lawsuits between believers.
[791.92 → 792.80] They were suing one another.
[792.80 → 797.50] There were all sorts of questions about what Paul was saying, people doubting the resurrection.
[798.14 → 802.98] There was a gap between the wealthy and the poor, and the wealthy were lording their positions over the poor in the church.
[803.06 → 803.72] It was a mess.
[804.22 → 806.56] And how does Paul start that letter to Corinthians?
[806.56 → 811.90] I always thank my God for you because of the grace given you in Jesus Christ.
[814.78 → 815.26] Gratitude.
[816.82 → 817.18] Thanksgiving.
[817.84 → 824.90] And we can learn a lot just from Paul's own posture as he writes to these churches that are going through a lot.
[824.90 → 825.70] They're young.
[825.82 → 826.40] They're immature.
[826.54 → 828.32] The culture is hard for them to live in.
[828.56 → 831.68] And he starts by saying, I always give thanks for you.
[833.32 → 838.10] It's important to note that when Paul shares these words of Thanksgiving, it's not just a warm-up routine.
[838.80 → 843.22] And it's not sort of a pseudo-thanksgiving to get out of the way before he deals with the stuff.
[843.28 → 846.64] Or it sort of covers over the stuff that's really going on in the church.
[846.86 → 848.24] It's honest Thanksgiving.
[848.92 → 851.52] And it doesn't sweep under the rug the stuff that's happening.
[851.62 → 857.38] I think in our context, I could be wrong, there can often be this pseudo-thanksgiving,
[857.46 → 861.54] a sort of fake smile where you want to hide the stuff that's not going right.
[861.62 → 865.76] You sit around the table with your family for Thanksgiving, and you sort of pretend everything's fine.
[865.78 → 866.30] But it's not.
[867.20 → 874.50] Paul is giving genuine gratitude, and he's also going to genuinely name all the mess and the problems in these churches.
[874.50 → 882.52] In fact, in Thessalonians, as we go through the series, he names, he puts his finger right on the places where there's pain and tension and hurt and sin.
[882.92 → 886.78] He has no problem doing that, calling out laziness, calling out unfaithfulness in marriages.
[887.00 → 888.54] He has no problem talking about that.
[889.18 → 893.80] But not for a second does it take him away from Thanksgiving.
[894.94 → 902.36] Not for a second does the mess of the church or the mess of the culture make Paul ungrateful and no longer able to give thanks to God.
[902.36 → 906.10] He starts his letters with deep, real gratitude.
[908.24 → 916.52] And that's because his gratitude is not dependent on how well these churches are doing or whatever vision of success people have for them.
[917.18 → 924.62] It's on the finished work of Jesus, the power of Christ that's in these churches, and his hope, Paul has, we're going to come back to this,
[925.00 → 928.34] that Jesus will finish what he began.
[928.34 → 933.08] Hope securely rooted that he's going to come back and make all things right.
[933.08 → 938.22] Now when Paul writes to Thessalonians, he starts with this gratitude.
[938.42 → 938.60] He says,
[938.60 → 955.78] Picture not Paul just with a quill in hand, but picture him meeting with Silas and with Timothy.
[955.90 → 959.32] Timothy came back with a report about how the church was doing in Thessalonica,
[959.54 → 962.30] and the three of them are together, and they're giving thanks.
[963.08 → 965.14] And what's the context for them giving thanks?
[965.14 → 965.62] Prayer.
[969.06 → 970.64] That's an important detail to me.
[971.04 → 974.80] They're not just thinking thankful thoughts, they're praying thankful prayers.
[974.88 → 979.10] And there's a difference between just thinking thankful thoughts and directing them to the Father,
[979.26 → 983.36] who is the source of all good things, who is the one who gives every good gift.
[983.48 → 983.88] And he's saying,
[984.14 → 988.04] We thank God, the giver of these gifts, for what we see in your church.
[988.98 → 992.04] He is the good Father who is at work in your midst.
[992.04 → 1001.64] Now there are three specific things that Timothy reports back on about how the church is doing that Paul gives thanks for.
[1002.92 → 1005.78] They are, number one, work produced by faith,
[1006.92 → 1009.88] love, sorry, labour prompted by love,
[1010.34 → 1013.48] and endurance inspired by hope in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1014.40 → 1016.12] And you see a sort of familiar triad.
[1016.22 → 1017.68] Paul always talks about faith, hope, and love.
[1017.68 → 1024.72] He writes them in all of his letters, and in this passage, he attaches them to specific activity in the church, work, labour, endurance.
[1025.50 → 1028.86] So I want to open up just briefly all three of these things that Paul is thankful for,
[1028.90 → 1031.38] and then come back to how this speaks to us today.
[1032.38 → 1033.94] Number one, Paul says,
[1034.38 → 1038.66] I give thanks for your work produced by faith.
[1039.10 → 1040.92] That's a punchy, powerful little statement.
[1041.32 → 1042.86] Work produced by faith.
[1042.86 → 1049.84] He's not saying that work gives them faith, or they're saved by their work, but that they are saved for work.
[1050.90 → 1051.74] Are you hearing them properly?
[1052.10 → 1053.70] You're saved for work.
[1053.88 → 1059.60] In our tradition, in the Reformed tradition, we emphasize big time that you are saved by grace apart from works.
[1060.02 → 1060.66] Ephesians 2.
[1061.14 → 1066.72] You did nothing for the gift that Christ has given you, the salvation he's provided for you through his finished work.
[1066.78 → 1067.62] It's all grace.
[1067.62 → 1071.78] But our tradition, we're pretty quiet on that second half.
[1072.92 → 1075.40] Saved for good work.
[1076.98 → 1079.88] In Ephesians 2, one of my favourite passages, Paul puts this together beautifully.
[1080.04 → 1080.18] He says,
[1080.46 → 1083.26] You are saved by grace apart from works, not by works.
[1083.52 → 1084.40] You cannot boast.
[1084.78 → 1085.54] And then he goes on to say,
[1085.66 → 1090.62] For we are God's handiwork, his masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus to do what?
[1090.80 → 1094.66] To do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
[1094.66 → 1102.68] And Paul is giving thanks that the church in Thessalonians, this small church, is doing good work.
[1103.52 → 1105.40] Their faith is not just a mental thing up here.
[1105.48 → 1107.60] They don't just have loose convictions rattling around their mind.
[1107.80 → 1108.50] It's concrete.
[1108.88 → 1113.78] It's tangible and visible in their community life, in their work in the city, the way they live their marriages.
[1114.10 → 1114.74] It's seen.
[1115.26 → 1116.62] Their faith is on display.
[1117.74 → 1119.20] It's not faith that lacks works.
[1119.28 → 1121.00] As James would say, it's not really faith at all.
[1121.00 → 1125.40] It's visible faith that takes shape in visible work.
[1125.48 → 1126.84] It's blessing the city.
[1127.06 → 1128.88] That's worth Thanksgiving.
[1131.06 → 1133.36] Secondly, Paul says to them,
[1133.56 → 1138.36] I give thanks for your labour prompted by love.
[1139.86 → 1144.56] Now, I think you and I all know the difference between labour prompted by force or paycheck,
[1145.00 → 1146.40] or because your parents said you had to,
[1147.14 → 1148.62] and labour prompted by love.
[1149.38 → 1150.38] There's a big difference.
[1151.04 → 1152.32] And the church, I want you to see this,
[1152.38 → 1154.56] in the widest possible sense, the work of the church.
[1154.66 → 1157.08] And I mean that your vocational work, your occupation,
[1157.30 → 1158.98] your work in the neighbourhood, your work in the church,
[1159.12 → 1161.22] all of that counts as work in the church.
[1161.62 → 1164.44] All of that is to be a labour of love.
[1166.16 → 1170.66] We don't care for the vulnerable because we have to only,
[1170.74 → 1171.42] even though it's a command.
[1171.80 → 1173.50] We don't love our neighbour, even the ones we don't like,
[1173.72 → 1174.88] simply because it's commanded.
[1174.98 → 1177.84] Although that's true, we do it out of love.
[1177.84 → 1182.88] As Christ, by his spirit, works in us, giving us a new ambition to care,
[1183.02 → 1186.68] to love, to serve, to bring ourselves down, to love our neighbour.
[1187.06 → 1188.02] We do it out of love.
[1188.30 → 1192.84] Let me give you a perfect illustration of how I saw this at work in our own church a couple of years ago.
[1192.84 → 1197.92] I was on this board in Clayton community that was made up of many people who worked for the city,
[1198.08 → 1199.76] libraries, rec centres, etc.
[1200.00 → 1205.06] And the goal of the board was to talk about how can we care for the families of young kids in Clayton.
[1206.16 → 1210.06] And at one of those meetings, there's a lady who worked for the library,
[1210.56 → 1214.30] and they had employed someone to do a story time program in their library.
[1214.38 → 1215.92] Lots of libraries have story time programs.
[1216.78 → 1219.78] And they were having trouble with that person showing up on time.
[1219.90 → 1220.56] There was turnover.
[1220.76 → 1223.98] People weren't happy with the wage that they got for doing these story time hours.
[1224.32 → 1225.78] And this lady turns to me in the meeting.
[1225.86 → 1228.60] She says, okay, your church has a story time group.
[1228.86 → 1230.40] How do you do story time?
[1230.46 → 1232.58] How do you manage the wages and the turnover?
[1233.78 → 1236.04] And that question totally caught me off guard,
[1236.04 → 1239.70] because the first thing that came to mind is we don't pay them.
[1240.66 → 1241.66] Now, my wife has done that group.
[1241.70 → 1242.58] Maybe she wants to be paid.
[1242.58 → 1243.70] They haven't brought that up with me.
[1244.08 → 1249.46] But story time in our church did not start with sort of this obligation to order or organize story time.
[1249.54 → 1253.40] It was simply three women who loved our community, saw a need.
[1253.58 → 1257.68] They loved telling stories and doing craft and being with kids, and so story time happened.
[1258.10 → 1260.00] It was a labour of love.
[1260.48 → 1264.24] And I tried in my best, generous, kind way to articulate that, saying,
[1264.52 → 1266.02] this is why they do it.
[1266.28 → 1267.26] They show up.
[1267.86 → 1269.08] They want to be there.
[1269.16 → 1270.50] There's no turnover yet.
[1270.50 → 1276.16] But the same is true for the many of us week after week, month after month,
[1276.20 → 1277.40] are serving at the community kitchen.
[1278.18 → 1282.10] In fact, if you've never been there, you should go there just to see the atmosphere
[1282.10 → 1287.80] and the mood of all the people making the meals, sitting down, sharing it with people who don't have homes.
[1287.88 → 1288.88] It's beautiful.
[1289.60 → 1290.98] It's a labour of love.
[1290.98 → 1294.94] But I want to include in this, and this is easy for us to forget,
[1295.24 → 1299.86] this is also true for the occupational work that we do in the church.
[1300.40 → 1302.04] This, too, is a labour of love.
[1302.08 → 1306.72] And I'm saying this because I'm very aware, as you are, that in our context,
[1307.10 → 1312.28] we choose jobs mostly because of what they pay, their prestige, how easy they are.
[1312.28 → 1314.58] You avoid jobs that you don't want to do because they're hard.
[1314.82 → 1317.42] And we want to do something that makes us a lot of money.
[1317.48 → 1318.80] So that's the ultimate choice.
[1318.88 → 1322.08] In university, people say, what can, the easiest work that makes the most amount of money,
[1322.44 → 1327.56] that is not the frame for Christians for work.
[1328.22 → 1330.22] And in Surge, we are always working this out.
[1330.56 → 1334.30] How is it that we begin to do our work out of love?
[1334.92 → 1336.12] We do it competently.
[1336.40 → 1337.52] We do it well.
[1337.52 → 1338.66] We do it thoughtfully.
[1338.80 → 1342.92] We care for our coworkers because we are doing it out of the love of Christ.
[1343.28 → 1345.50] What a different frame that would be for work.
[1345.82 → 1349.58] How much could we change the atmosphere of our workforce
[1349.58 → 1353.26] if that was the way Christians walked in on Monday morning to the workplace?
[1354.60 → 1355.28] And I have a burden.
[1355.38 → 1356.16] I've shared this before.
[1356.28 → 1359.18] For students in high school and university who are discerning their careers,
[1359.58 → 1363.98] I have a burden to sort of help them see vocation through the lens of faith.
[1363.98 → 1368.72] Where the question is not about income, the question is not first about what's easy,
[1368.80 → 1372.20] but it's like, how can I as a student with the gifts I have,
[1372.26 → 1374.96] the gifts that God has given me, unique burdens I have,
[1375.14 → 1380.88] how do I love my neighbour for the next 40 plus years with my time?
[1381.68 → 1385.78] Oh, how I would love for our students to be forming that question in university.
[1385.78 → 1393.16] Paul gives thanks that the work in the church is done out of love.
[1393.84 → 1394.52] And what's the work?
[1394.68 → 1396.76] Well, we know just by looking through Thessalonians
[1396.76 → 1399.12] that they are standing firm in the midst of persecution.
[1399.98 → 1402.84] They are staying firm and saying, we believe in Jesus,
[1403.08 → 1406.04] even if we're losing positions of power, even if we're being mocked,
[1406.20 → 1407.96] even if some believers are being killed for the faith,
[1408.26 → 1410.60] we are standing on this belief.
[1411.24 → 1412.84] We know that they encourage one another.
[1413.36 → 1415.50] We know that they share the gospel with people in their city.
[1415.78 → 1417.56] We know that they love their church.
[1418.20 → 1420.50] That's a big deal, by the way, to love your church.
[1420.54 → 1422.68] When you know all the ins and outs and all the broken pieces,
[1423.06 → 1424.90] this church loves their church.
[1425.00 → 1430.30] And Paul says, we give thanks that the work you do is a labour of love.
[1432.66 → 1438.10] Thirdly, Paul says, we give thanks for the endurance you have
[1438.10 → 1441.90] that is inspired by the hope you have in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1442.72 → 1444.30] This is a significant statement.
[1444.30 → 1448.58] Now, hope for Paul, you need to see, is a very, very packed word.
[1449.04 → 1450.88] It's not just sort of ideas he has about the future.
[1451.00 → 1454.10] It's not just some vague sense of what might or what might not come.
[1454.66 → 1457.54] Hope for Paul is about the death and the resurrection of Jesus
[1457.54 → 1459.20] and what it seals for the future.
[1460.84 → 1466.00] And hope for Paul is confidence that Jesus is returning as Lord and King
[1466.00 → 1469.08] to restore all things, establish his kingdom fully.
[1469.08 → 1472.54] And if that's the future, it gives shape to the present.
[1472.54 → 1476.68] And if you don't already know this, the way you see the future,
[1477.38 → 1480.52] the way you think about the future, it shapes how you work in the present,
[1481.26 → 1482.06] whether you know it or not.
[1482.74 → 1485.90] If you have no hope for the future, it's not going to be a great motivator
[1485.90 → 1486.38] for the present.
[1487.04 → 1487.50] And vice versa.
[1487.56 → 1490.36] If you're hopeful about the future, it gives you purpose for what you do
[1490.36 → 1490.78] in the present.
[1490.78 → 1494.16] And Paul is saying, you, church of Thessalonians, you have hope.
[1494.52 → 1497.60] You share my hope for the resurrected Jesus coming in glory and power.
[1497.88 → 1499.84] And it motivates you to stand firm.
[1500.82 → 1504.32] It compels you to continue to love your city, the one that persecutes you.
[1504.44 → 1506.66] It compels you to continue to love your brother and sister,
[1506.88 → 1508.04] even though they're hard to live with.
[1508.44 → 1509.58] You have hope.
[1509.78 → 1511.18] And it's fuelling endurance.
[1511.18 → 1518.60] So these are the three things that Paul gives thanks for in the church
[1518.60 → 1519.32] in Thessalonians.
[1519.78 → 1525.58] Faith, love, hope that produces work, labour, and endurance.
[1526.46 → 1529.76] And the question I want us to ask this morning with the remaining time we have is,
[1530.32 → 1536.74] how is God by His Spirit speaking to us today as we listen in to what He said
[1536.74 → 1539.28] to the church in Thessalonians 2,000 years ago?
[1539.28 → 1542.20] How is God speaking to us?
[1542.24 → 1543.80] And bring this question to your small groups,
[1544.34 → 1549.62] but I want to share just two things briefly that are on my heart after a week
[1549.62 → 1550.78] of being in this passage.
[1551.90 → 1557.52] Number one, I think that statement on endurance inspired by hope is one we need
[1557.52 → 1558.34] to wrestle with.
[1558.76 → 1559.88] You know why I think this?
[1560.60 → 1564.42] I don't think endurance is something people describe Western Christians as having.
[1565.88 → 1568.32] Does anyone describe a Western church as an enduring church?
[1569.84 → 1570.64] I'm not sure.
[1571.42 → 1574.96] But one of the reasons I think that is because I'm pretty sure I'm not positive.
[1575.06 → 1575.76] I don't know the future.
[1576.18 → 1581.64] I'm pretty sure it's going to get harder for the Western church as we go in our society,
[1581.80 → 1583.88] more likely than it is to get easier.
[1583.88 → 1590.54] I think the secular context in which we live will make it more difficult for us to be faithful
[1590.54 → 1595.76] in our witness and pressure us more and more to take our belief that Jesus is Lord and King
[1595.76 → 1601.68] and Saviour of all and sort of force us to see this as a private commitment we have on Sundays
[1601.68 → 1604.54] that has no bearing on our public life and society.
[1604.54 → 1609.92] And I think the church of Jesus Christ, if it wants to be faithful, will need to learn
[1609.92 → 1610.96] endurance.
[1612.36 → 1617.66] Plotting along faithfully, joyfully, even when the going gets tough.
[1618.56 → 1621.38] And I know maybe some of you are thinking, wow, Dave, this is your Thanksgiving sermon?
[1621.74 → 1623.50] Talking about endurance and difficulty?
[1623.98 → 1625.88] Well, Paul did it, so I just joined him in it.
[1625.88 → 1631.78] But for that to happen, hope needs to be born in the church, right?
[1632.24 → 1636.82] If we were to endure in the present, whatever the challenges may be, it's born out of a hope
[1636.82 → 1637.42] for the future.
[1638.44 → 1642.44] And I think my prayer for the church this week is that God opens our eyes to the fact that
[1642.44 → 1643.92] Jesus finished the work.
[1645.10 → 1646.62] He died and He rose.
[1646.88 → 1648.82] He is not just sitting on His thumbs doing nothing.
[1648.94 → 1650.54] He's reigning over the whole creation.
[1651.40 → 1655.86] And if that's true, He's coming, and He's going to make things right.
[1656.46 → 1661.42] And we can endure because we know the day is coming where there will be no suffering.
[1661.96 → 1664.64] There will be no more vaccinations needed because bodies are healthy.
[1664.86 → 1665.88] No more MRIs.
[1666.08 → 1666.74] No more violence.
[1666.86 → 1671.76] No more corrupt leaders making corrupt decisions that benefit them and punish the citizens of
[1671.76 → 1672.18] their countries.
[1672.46 → 1676.24] That's coming to an end when Jesus establishes His kingdom fully.
[1678.12 → 1679.48] You can say amen to that.
[1680.24 → 1681.36] There we go, people.
[1681.36 → 1687.80] I think that's one of the areas where we need to listen well to this passage.
[1687.80 → 1694.02] But secondly and personally, when I read this Thanksgiving from Paul, as he writes to a
[1694.02 → 1701.62] very ordinary church with all sorts of problems, I think, how do I develop that gratitude for
[1701.62 → 1702.16] the church?
[1702.16 → 1708.64] How does God open my eyes the way He opened Paul's eyes to see the mess of the church, how small and
[1708.64 → 1712.32] weak it is, how complicated and hard it is to be faithful in a secular culture?
[1712.58 → 1718.78] How do I have the perspective of always giving thanks for what God is doing by Christ in His church?
[1718.78 → 1727.16] And I say that because in our context, so many people have given up on the church, right?
[1728.68 → 1730.18] Add your word.
[1730.78 → 1732.84] I don't like church because blank.
[1733.90 → 1734.86] Too judgmental.
[1736.36 → 1736.82] Hypocritical.
[1737.32 → 1740.80] At a step with the way our society thinks about so many social issues.
[1741.10 → 1741.70] Fill in the blank.
[1741.78 → 1743.34] There are so many reasons to say, what a mess.
[1743.58 → 1745.10] Why would I be part of that church?
[1745.10 → 1748.68] And Paul had just as many reasons.
[1749.46 → 1752.18] I mean, if you listen to some of the things he names in these early churches, you think,
[1752.24 → 1752.46] wow.
[1752.76 → 1754.08] He had reason to be frustrated.
[1754.20 → 1756.12] He had reason to say, we're done here.
[1756.26 → 1756.88] No more letters.
[1757.04 → 1757.84] Just close up shop.
[1757.90 → 1758.84] This church is a mess.
[1759.18 → 1763.72] And yet Paul over and over and over again says, I give thanks to the Father for the grace
[1763.72 → 1765.42] given you in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1765.94 → 1768.08] Let me tell you why I'm so thankful.
[1768.08 → 1775.04] And I think that own posture he has of prayer is probably the first step we need to make
[1775.04 → 1776.26] in order to have this posture.
[1777.20 → 1782.30] It's the posture of prayer that helps us to see the church, our community, our family, as
[1782.30 → 1783.30] God sees it.
[1784.78 → 1788.68] Seeing the grace, being able to see what God is doing, seeing what Christ is doing, how
[1788.68 → 1793.46] he's changing, transforming, renewing ambitions, bringing about his own life in this broken community
[1793.46 → 1794.26] in a broken city.
[1794.26 → 1796.68] We need that vision to start in prayer.
[1799.86 → 1804.78] And I encourage you this week in your small groups, pray for the church.
[1806.70 → 1808.16] Even the areas that frustrate you.
[1808.20 → 1809.46] You're never going to have it the way you like it.
[1809.50 → 1811.94] The more you get to know our church, if you're new, there's going to be things that frustrate
[1811.94 → 1812.18] you.
[1812.76 → 1814.92] There's going to be things that you wish were more like the way you think.
[1815.90 → 1817.72] And if you pray, bring those into prayer.
[1818.38 → 1822.14] The hope is that you'll have alignment with the grace of what God is doing in the church.
[1822.14 → 1823.32] You'll see it differently.
[1823.32 → 1825.86] You'll have a different vision for the church.
[1826.62 → 1831.56] And you'll be able to mirror Paul's own prayer saying, I give thanks for the grace given
[1831.56 → 1832.12] to the church.
[1832.40 → 1836.50] I always remember the church in my prayers, giving thanks to him for its existence, for
[1836.50 → 1839.58] what Christ is doing and Christ will do in and through this community.
[1842.10 → 1847.20] Faith, hope, love, producing work, labour, and endurance.
[1847.34 → 1849.38] That's Paul's prayer for the church.
[1849.38 → 1851.94] That's his grateful heart for the church.
[1852.28 → 1856.22] And oh hope, how I pray that that will be true for our church this morning.
[1856.88 → 1857.52] Let's pray.
[1857.52 → 1868.12] Father, we stop to give you thanks for the existence of your church.
[1869.90 → 1875.34] That 2,020 years after your resurrection, your church is still here.
[1876.30 → 1877.72] It is around the world.
[1877.72 → 1885.96] Father, we give you praise.
[1885.96 → 1891.58] Father, we ask, Lord, that you would give us grateful hearts.
[1891.58 → 1897.74] That you would open our eyes to see how Jesus Christ is working in our midst.
[1899.12 → 1909.88] We pray that we would be known for work produced by faith, for labour produced by love, and endurance
[1909.88 → 1911.76] inspired by hope.
[1911.76 → 1917.96] Father, would you pour your spirit on us so that we would be a faithful witness today.
[1918.68 → 1922.44] We pray this in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, our resurrected King.
[1922.98 → 1923.30] Amen.
[1927.04 → 1931.14] This is the point in our service where we get to celebrate communion together.
[1931.28 → 1936.24] So I invite you to take your medical-looking little things that have the elements in them.
[1936.24 → 1941.18] I was joking with some people in the first service that they kind of look like something
[1941.18 → 1942.92] you'd see on a tray in a hospital.
[1944.22 → 1950.00] And I have to admit that after doing communion with my family in our home, and we got to break
[1950.00 → 1954.10] a big loaf together and share it around the family and say, the body of Christ given for
[1954.10 → 1957.24] you, these tiny little trays just don't quite do it for me.
[1957.54 → 1961.16] But I also give thanks that we get to celebrate communion.
[1961.60 → 1961.86] Amen.
[1961.86 → 1970.02] My prayer this morning as we celebrate this meal is that Christ would restore to us the
[1970.02 → 1971.06] joy of our salvation.
[1972.26 → 1978.22] That you, as you take in these very ordinary elements of bread and juice, would receive
[1978.22 → 1980.84] the life that you have in Christ.
[1981.62 → 1987.32] As one writer puts it, that we would know in the core of our being that despite how we feel,
[1988.04 → 1989.44] we are God's free people.
[1989.44 → 1993.78] That in His death and resurrection, Jesus defeated the power of sin.
[1993.90 → 1995.04] He defeated Satan.
[1995.32 → 1996.76] He defeated death itself.
[1997.06 → 2002.40] And those gifts He gives to the church, He says, that is yours as you are in me.
[2003.46 → 2010.64] And I pray that this morning you would receive that joy of being found and saved in Jesus Christ,
[2011.10 → 2012.18] our resurrected King.
[2012.18 → 2019.00] On the night Jesus was betrayed, He took very ordinary bread and in a very ordinary Passover
[2019.00 → 2020.54] meal, He said bizarre words.
[2020.62 → 2025.76] He said to His disciples, this is my body given for you.
[2026.48 → 2028.44] Do this in remembrance of me.
[2029.74 → 2031.46] And then He did another strange thing.
[2032.12 → 2040.52] He took the wine then, and He poured it, and He said, this is the cup of the new covenant in
[2040.52 → 2042.34] my blood.
[2042.34 → 2044.30] Do this in remembrance of me.
[2045.30 → 2050.58] The disciples had no idea then what that meant until after His resurrection.
[2051.44 → 2056.16] And then they realized that this very ordinary meal now celebrated the most important event
[2056.16 → 2060.22] in world history, what Jesus did in dying and rising from the grave.
[2060.22 → 2066.54] And as Paul says to the church, whenever we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim
[2066.54 → 2072.80] together with the church of all ages the death of Jesus, the victory of Jesus until He comes
[2072.80 → 2073.46] again.
[2074.58 → 2081.24] And so brothers and sisters of faith, this is the gift of Christ for the body of Christ.
[2081.24 → 2088.72] And if you believe you are part of His church, if Jesus is who He says He is to you, you are welcome
[2088.72 → 2090.84] to participate in this meal.
[2094.48 → 2104.04] So brothers and sisters, take, eat, remember, and believe that Jesus Christ has paid for all
[2104.04 → 2105.82] of our sin with His body.
[2125.82 → 2133.88] Take, drink, remember, and believe that the blood of Jesus was shed for the complete forgiveness
[2133.88 → 2135.02] of our sins.
[2148.02 → 2149.26] Let me lead us in prayer.
[2152.70 → 2153.74] Father, we thank You.
[2154.48 → 2155.90] We thank You for Your grace.
[2156.64 → 2158.10] We thank You for the cross.
[2159.00 → 2163.08] And we thank You that in Jesus' death and resurrection, we are free people.
[2163.88 → 2169.76] We ask that You would fill us with the joy of our salvation in spite of whatever circumstances
[2169.76 → 2171.04] we find ourselves in.
[2171.62 → 2178.26] We pray that You would renew us by Your Spirit, that we would live as Your children in the freedom
[2178.26 → 2179.28] that comes from Jesus.
[2180.04 → 2180.38] Amen.
