[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 92.62]  He was a pastor in World War II.
[93.38 --> 97.08]  He was arrested and imprisoned and later killed by the Nazis.
[97.32 --> 100.30]  But he wrote this about Advent and said this.
[100.88 --> 103.80]  Advent is like sitting in a prison cell.
[105.00 --> 110.30]  One cannot do anything except hope, pray, and wait.
[110.30 --> 111.28]  And then this.
[112.38 --> 114.80]  Deliverance must come from the outside.
[116.06 --> 121.56]  And now we are going to read a passage for today about that outside deliverance.
[122.22 --> 124.04]  So let's look at Luke 2 together.
[125.36 --> 127.82]  Luke 2, the verses 8 through 20.
[127.82 --> 135.60]  And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[136.26 --> 138.52]  An angel of the Lord appeared to them.
[139.24 --> 141.32]  And the glory of the Lord shone around them.
[141.76 --> 143.18]  And they were terrified.
[143.94 --> 144.98]  But the angel said to them,
[144.98 --> 145.72]  Don't be afraid.
[145.88 --> 150.22]  I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.
[151.04 --> 153.80]  Today in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.
[154.14 --> 156.32]  He is the Messiah, the Lord.
[156.40 --> 157.62]  And this will be a sign to you.
[157.70 --> 160.96]  You will find a baby wrapped in claws and lying in a manger.
[160.96 --> 165.88]  And suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel,
[166.04 --> 167.14]  praising God and saying,
[167.52 --> 171.38]  Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.
[171.66 --> 174.36]  And when the angels had left them and gone into heaven,
[174.72 --> 175.92]  the shepherds said to one another,
[176.12 --> 178.86]  Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened,
[178.96 --> 180.72]  which the Lord has told us about.
[181.68 --> 186.16]  And so they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger.
[186.52 --> 187.62]  And when they had seen him,
[187.62 --> 191.58]  they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child.
[192.18 --> 196.16]  All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
[197.16 --> 200.40]  But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
[200.88 --> 205.26]  And the shepherds returned, glorifying, praising God for all the things they had heard and seen,
[205.80 --> 208.22]  which were just as they had been told.
[211.08 --> 215.02]  Luke's narrative invites a calm, slow telling, really.
[215.02 --> 217.06]  You know, it starts off with,
[217.16 --> 219.16]  And it came to pass in those days.
[219.42 --> 226.28]  And he assures us that Jesus' birth marks God's entry into the long flow of human history.
[226.66 --> 229.74]  Into the good, into the bad, and everything in between.
[230.82 --> 234.80]  We notice that God shares this good news through his angels.
[235.60 --> 239.32]  We see an angel tell Mary, or talk to Mary.
[239.44 --> 240.80]  We see an angel talking to Joseph.
[241.06 --> 243.22]  And we see these angels telling the shepherds.
[243.22 --> 248.70]  God delivers his good news to the lowly.
[249.34 --> 251.50]  To those living in tough times.
[251.94 --> 258.08]  And so today, I want to take a little bit of a closer look at the shepherds in this story.
[259.24 --> 260.58]  I want to look at this for a moment here.
[260.62 --> 264.72]  In Scripture, there's lots of stories that involve shepherds.
[264.78 --> 268.32]  We can go all the way back to Abraham, 2,000 years before Christ.
[268.70 --> 269.80]  And he's a herdsman.
[269.88 --> 271.00]  He has flocks.
[271.00 --> 272.56]  He's a shepherd.
[273.76 --> 275.92]  We see that with Isaac and Jacob as well.
[276.02 --> 277.68]  These are what we call the patriarch.
[277.90 --> 279.02]  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[279.12 --> 280.12]  The founders of the faith.
[280.60 --> 281.64]  They're shepherds.
[282.80 --> 284.06]  And we move on to Jacob.
[284.34 --> 285.94]  Jacob had 12 sons.
[286.78 --> 289.44]  The one that I think is most well known is Joseph.
[289.58 --> 290.74]  The multicolored coat.
[291.08 --> 292.38]  The one who interpreted the dreams.
[292.54 --> 294.06]  Sold by his brothers into slavery.
[294.06 --> 297.54]  And he ends up becoming second in command of all of Egypt.
[298.08 --> 301.70]  Eventually, Israel ends up in Egypt in a land called Goshen.
[301.78 --> 302.98]  And I put one verse down here.
[303.06 --> 305.36]  I took it out of the message that describes this.
[305.44 --> 310.74]  And Joseph is telling his brothers what to say when they're going to meet Pharaoh, the most powerful man of the world.
[310.74 --> 311.50]  And we read this.
[312.46 --> 320.34]  When Pharaoh calls you in and asks you what kind of work you do, tell him, your servants have always kept livestock for as long as we can remember.
[320.84 --> 322.68]  And we and our parents also.
[323.94 --> 328.82]  That way, he'll let you stay apart in an area of Goshen.
[328.82 --> 334.02]  For Egyptians look down on anyone who is a shepherd.
[335.14 --> 337.64]  And we see something, a bit of a trend start here.
[338.18 --> 339.72]  Looking down on shepherds.
[339.82 --> 342.04]  This is often, there were, shepherds were nomads.
[342.12 --> 346.62]  They wandered around, letting their flocks graze on farmland.
[346.68 --> 348.38]  And the farmers didn't like that very much.
[348.44 --> 350.58]  So there's something happening here.
[350.66 --> 354.10]  But Israel ends up being 400 years in slavery.
[354.10 --> 359.10]  In a land where they are shepherds, in a culture which looks down on shepherds.
[359.96 --> 362.34]  And that has some influence on the mindset of Israel.
[362.92 --> 366.12]  They are, like all of us, affected by the culture they live in.
[367.22 --> 368.50]  We'll keep moving forward here.
[369.00 --> 370.40]  We go to the first king, Saul.
[371.46 --> 372.42]  He blows it.
[372.50 --> 373.56]  He doesn't do a very good job.
[373.68 --> 375.58]  God wants to replace him with a new king.
[375.90 --> 382.66]  The prophet Samuel is called to look for a new king that God has chosen and anoint that new king.
[382.66 --> 385.50]  They go to a household of a guy named Jesse.
[385.78 --> 387.40]  He has a whole whack of sons.
[387.64 --> 389.24]  Big, strapping, strong guys.
[389.72 --> 393.08]  None of them are chosen by God to be that king.
[393.52 --> 394.96]  And so he asked, are there any others?
[395.54 --> 398.00]  And they said, well, yeah, yeah, there's one more.
[398.14 --> 400.06]  It's our youngest son.
[400.30 --> 404.36]  And he's young and he's a shepherd.
[404.58 --> 405.84]  And his name is David.
[406.58 --> 408.02]  But, you know, that can't be right.
[408.26 --> 409.86]  We can't have that happen.
[409.86 --> 412.88]  And we see God do the upside down thing here.
[413.12 --> 420.00]  Here the youngest, who is a shepherd, which was often the case for the youngest, becomes king of Israel.
[420.92 --> 424.24]  The one who writes, Psalm 23, verse 1, right?
[424.32 --> 425.42]  The Lord is my shepherd.
[425.48 --> 426.62]  I will lack nothing.
[427.36 --> 430.10]  That man becomes king.
[430.96 --> 431.64]  A shepherd.
[431.64 --> 435.78]  Now, fast forward to this time of Jesus.
[436.66 --> 440.44]  This process of looking down on shepherds has continued.
[441.48 --> 444.60]  I read in one commentary, I read this.
[444.60 --> 456.82]  While shepherds could be romanticized, as was King David, they were usually ranked with donkey drivers, tanners, sailors, butchers, camel drivers, and other despised occupations.
[458.32 --> 463.88]  Being away from home at night, they were unable to protect their women, hence considered dishonorable.
[463.88 --> 470.76]  In addition, they were often considered thieves because they grazed their flocks on other people's property.
[472.26 --> 475.46]  They were seen as people to be avoided.
[476.14 --> 478.80]  They were seen as a public nuisance.
[480.64 --> 487.64]  In this time, we have rabbis arguing, how could David, King David, a man after God's own heart,
[487.64 --> 491.78]  how could he call God a good shepherd?
[491.78 --> 491.98]  Shepherds.
[494.58 --> 500.26]  The leaders in this day, they said, don't buy from shepherds because it's likely stolen property.
[501.62 --> 509.16]  They also said, if you walk by, you're walking along and you see a shepherd who has fallen in a pit, you don't have to help.
[510.82 --> 513.74]  You can see shepherds aren't looked upon favorably.
[516.74 --> 519.68]  It's almost saying like shepherd lives don't matter.
[519.68 --> 523.26]  Nobody was standing up for them.
[524.38 --> 526.18]  And the leaders had their reasons.
[526.88 --> 527.84]  They always do.
[528.52 --> 530.26]  God had given Israel the law.
[531.66 --> 536.32]  God had wanted his people to know what it is to be purified and cleansed.
[536.38 --> 538.62]  There was lots of rituals and sacrifices.
[538.82 --> 539.68]  There was the Sabbath.
[539.68 --> 548.84]  So you better stay away from what is unclean and you better stay away from whoever is unclean so they don't mess you up.
[549.72 --> 552.78]  And these shepherds were unclean.
[553.94 --> 558.02]  They didn't go to the temple regularly to sacrifice for their impurities.
[558.98 --> 559.82]  They really couldn't.
[559.82 --> 562.50]  God said, keep the Sabbath holy.
[562.88 --> 564.48]  But these people just kept working.
[564.90 --> 569.82]  Apparently sheep needed care and watching even on the Sabbath.
[571.50 --> 577.74]  And these shepherds were often out in the fields, away from people, away from the temple, away from the cleansing ritual.
[577.74 --> 579.08]  Not able to sacrifice.
[579.48 --> 582.22]  Not able to be purified.
[582.22 --> 583.22]  Not able to sacrifice.
[584.36 --> 596.24]  Ironically, they are the ones who provide the lambs and the sheep for the sacrifice so that Israel could practice their purification laws and rituals.
[596.74 --> 600.50]  These are the shepherds that we read about here in Luke 2.
[601.42 --> 603.22]  Really, the shepherds are the outcasts.
[604.42 --> 606.24]  They are the ones who don't belong.
[606.56 --> 608.60]  They are the ones who don't fit in.
[608.60 --> 613.60]  They made me think, so who are our outcasts?
[615.12 --> 616.00]  The homeless?
[617.22 --> 618.50]  The addicts?
[619.22 --> 621.06]  Those who don't think like us?
[621.16 --> 622.52]  Those who don't live like us?
[622.56 --> 623.22]  Look like us?
[623.28 --> 624.14]  Behave like us?
[624.42 --> 626.78]  Who are the outcasts for us?
[627.86 --> 630.86]  You know, if David had written Psalm 23 today, maybe he would have written,
[631.22 --> 632.50]  The Lord is my outcast.
[632.60 --> 634.40]  The one who hangs out with the outcasts.
[634.40 --> 634.64]  Right?
[634.64 --> 646.72]  How do we take this gospel story that includes the lowly, that includes the outcasts, the ones who don't belong, who aren't important or powerful,
[647.02 --> 649.32]  what does this story say to us?
[650.44 --> 655.80]  Because we read here, the angel of the Lord appeared to them.
[657.38 --> 658.34]  To them.
[658.34 --> 662.02]  This has huge implications.
[662.24 --> 664.20]  I'm sure many of you have set up your manger scenes.
[664.54 --> 668.22]  This has huge implications on how you look at that manger scene.
[669.38 --> 669.48]  Right?
[670.06 --> 675.18]  I mean, there's a barn or a stable scene, so it's not a temple, it's not a palace.
[675.56 --> 677.52]  There's a pregnant teenage girl involved.
[677.84 --> 681.26]  There's a bunch of nobody shepherds, society's outcasts.
[681.46 --> 684.54]  And then the wise men are there too, so we have a bunch of foreigners as well.
[684.54 --> 691.14]  Now, the angel comes to them.
[692.60 --> 695.60]  To the shepherds in the fields.
[695.80 --> 697.10]  And it's cold and it's dark.
[697.46 --> 699.64]  The angels join them in their space.
[699.88 --> 700.84]  In the fields.
[701.12 --> 702.08]  Not at the temple.
[703.08 --> 704.06]  Not at the palace.
[704.60 --> 707.56]  Not avoiding them because of their uncleanness.
[707.90 --> 710.20]  Entering their world with the good news.
[710.20 --> 713.92]  With the news of peace and good will.
[714.20 --> 717.90]  A royal proclamation that Christ and his kingdom has come.
[719.20 --> 720.64]  Given not to the kings.
[720.76 --> 721.74]  Not to the religious leaders.
[722.02 --> 724.58]  Not to Caesar, the most powerful man in the world.
[726.34 --> 727.34]  To lowly nobodies.
[727.34 --> 733.98]  I was thinking if it was up to Caesar, the tables of the powerful would never be overturned.
[735.20 --> 738.60]  When Caesar hears about the good news of the gospel, he only knows to crush it.
[739.08 --> 740.58]  To crucify it.
[742.58 --> 747.60]  Yet on these Palestinian hills, we hear the royal proclamation of a new reality.
[747.60 --> 751.58]  Where peace comes not from armies, but from justice.
[752.18 --> 754.92]  Where sin withers in the face of truth.
[755.38 --> 757.92]  Where all, all are invited to the table.
[758.14 --> 760.34]  And all are invited to belong.
[761.34 --> 763.16]  Where love conquers fear.
[765.18 --> 771.16]  And the angels say, I bring you good news of great joy for all the people.
[772.12 --> 773.02]  All the people.
[773.62 --> 774.64]  Including the shepherds.
[775.50 --> 777.58]  Including all the outcasts.
[777.60 --> 781.10]  Including all the people who don't feel like they belong.
[781.78 --> 785.42]  Yes, the angel army breaks forth in proclamation.
[785.98 --> 788.48]  And in praise of the king of kings.
[788.92 --> 790.74]  Whose peace he brings.
[791.08 --> 793.12]  Whose kingdom has come and is coming.
[793.42 --> 794.66]  And they say, fear not.
[794.84 --> 799.06]  For this kingdom and this king is for all people.
[800.44 --> 802.52]  He longs for all to know him.
[803.80 --> 805.26]  And these shepherds respond.
[806.52 --> 807.16]  They respond.
[807.16 --> 809.40]  Not with lots of questions.
[809.82 --> 815.16]  But with a desire to experience what has been told to them by the angels.
[815.16 --> 816.16]  Sometimes.
[817.92 --> 818.36]  Sometimes.
[819.76 --> 822.26]  When you're up to your neck and struggle.
[823.26 --> 824.26]  And problems.
[824.54 --> 825.48]  And pain and hurt.
[826.44 --> 827.98]  Sometimes we have a lot of questions.
[829.44 --> 830.98]  I think mostly why questions.
[832.24 --> 833.60]  And maybe these shepherds.
[833.80 --> 835.24]  Who didn't have the easiest life in the world.
[835.48 --> 837.38]  Maybe these shepherds had a lot of questions too.
[837.38 --> 838.38]  But for now.
[838.38 --> 839.20]  And I love this.
[839.20 --> 839.80]  For now.
[839.80 --> 841.58]  They simply move forward.
[842.88 --> 845.50]  They simply move to go and see.
[845.66 --> 847.82]  Holding on to the promise of the Christ child.
[847.98 --> 849.36]  That has come into the darkness.
[849.66 --> 850.50]  With us.
[850.82 --> 853.00]  And therefore the world is not the same.
[853.00 --> 853.56]  You know.
[853.56 --> 854.00]  You know.
[854.00 --> 854.76]  You know.
[854.76 --> 857.68]  You know.
[857.68 --> 857.88]  And.
[859.38 --> 860.88]  We celebrate that coming.
[861.00 --> 861.88]  That Christmas.
[862.10 --> 862.16]  But.
[862.16 --> 862.68]  You know.
[862.74 --> 864.88]  It still can seem like a pretty dark world sometimes.
[864.88 --> 865.16]  Right.
[866.50 --> 867.62]  We've got the pandemic.
[869.24 --> 870.94]  Struggles with relationships.
[870.94 --> 872.38]  Polarization.
[872.84 --> 873.40]  In society.
[873.90 --> 874.46]  Addiction.
[875.06 --> 875.62]  Pollution.
[875.88 --> 876.40]  Deception.
[876.70 --> 877.04]  War.
[877.24 --> 877.72]  Racism.
[877.86 --> 878.26]  Loneliness.
[878.70 --> 879.32]  Health issues.
[879.42 --> 880.32]  And you can go on and on.
[880.70 --> 884.26]  But the light shines in the dark places.
[884.38 --> 885.48]  And it shows up best there.
[888.44 --> 892.38]  Made me think of John's telling of the gospel.
[892.50 --> 893.52]  And he starts it off this way.
[893.52 --> 894.06]  In John 1.
[894.10 --> 895.04]  The verses 4 to 5.
[895.42 --> 896.18]  Where we read.
[897.36 --> 898.92]  In Jesus was life.
[898.92 --> 902.20]  And that life was the light.
[902.42 --> 903.02]  And here we go.
[903.36 --> 904.84]  Of all mankind.
[905.92 --> 906.24]  All.
[907.36 --> 909.22]  The light shines in the darkness.
[910.10 --> 911.58]  Whatever that darkness may be.
[912.34 --> 915.02]  And the darkness has not and cannot overcome it.
[918.46 --> 921.34]  In that dark night where the shepherds were.
[922.78 --> 924.44]  A great light was shone.
[924.44 --> 927.30]  And these shepherds go.
[927.74 --> 928.04]  Go.
[928.46 --> 929.44]  To Bethlehem.
[929.52 --> 930.68]  In order to see more.
[931.44 --> 932.54]  In order to.
[933.10 --> 933.78]  Dare I say.
[933.86 --> 934.32]  Be enlightened.
[935.60 --> 936.80]  And they come.
[937.08 --> 938.24]  As they are.
[939.50 --> 940.66]  No clean clothes.
[941.46 --> 942.42]  Not a quick shower.
[942.56 --> 943.42]  No cleansed hearts.
[943.54 --> 944.44]  No ritual purification.
[945.64 --> 947.48]  They didn't clean up the rack.
[947.72 --> 949.44]  Or they didn't improve their reputations.
[950.60 --> 952.42]  They just come.
[953.32 --> 954.20]  As they are.
[954.44 --> 958.34]  In Romans 5.
[958.40 --> 958.62]  8.
[958.76 --> 959.26]  We read.
[960.04 --> 960.58]  That sort of.
[960.72 --> 961.22]  Fits this.
[961.30 --> 962.18]  What I'm trying to say here.
[962.70 --> 963.12]  Where it says.
[963.22 --> 965.24]  But God demonstrates his love.
[965.64 --> 966.28]  For us.
[966.46 --> 967.18]  In this.
[968.26 --> 970.48]  While we were still.
[970.94 --> 971.42]  Sinners.
[972.62 --> 973.58]  Christ was born.
[973.68 --> 974.72]  And Christ died for us.
[976.00 --> 977.22]  While we were sinners.
[978.22 --> 980.22]  We didn't clean ourselves up.
[980.44 --> 980.76]  At all.
[981.26 --> 981.58]  And so.
[981.58 --> 982.28]  And really.
[982.28 --> 983.02]  The truth is.
[983.02 --> 984.24]  We all come.
[984.24 --> 985.66]  As outcast.
[985.88 --> 986.64]  All of us.
[986.96 --> 988.12]  We all come broken.
[988.50 --> 989.62]  We all come as sinners.
[989.62 --> 989.74]  Shepherds.
[991.94 --> 993.54]  And then here's a beautiful picture.
[993.64 --> 994.28]  These broken.
[994.50 --> 994.90]  Messy.
[995.26 --> 996.14]  Messy shepherds.
[996.18 --> 996.60]  They come.
[996.74 --> 997.40]  And what do they see?
[997.46 --> 998.28]  They see a baby.
[998.40 --> 998.54]  I mean.
[998.58 --> 1000.24]  Talk about non-threatening.
[1000.62 --> 1001.24]  Talk about.
[1001.72 --> 1002.24]  God.
[1002.52 --> 1003.76]  Fitting in with us.
[1004.60 --> 1005.44]  The shepherds see.
[1005.58 --> 1007.52]  One who is like them.
[1007.76 --> 1009.28]  And with them.
[1009.28 --> 1010.02]  And yet.
[1010.16 --> 1010.70]  Somehow.
[1010.70 --> 1012.36]  The Messiah of the world.
[1014.22 --> 1016.18]  One who relates to us.
[1016.18 --> 1017.84]  Because he's one of us.
[1020.84 --> 1023.16]  He joins the outcast.
[1025.54 --> 1026.50]  And then the.
[1026.90 --> 1027.96]  Those shepherds.
[1028.52 --> 1028.72]  Who.
[1028.72 --> 1029.44]  By the way.
[1029.56 --> 1032.16]  Were not allowed to testify in court.
[1032.42 --> 1033.38]  Because their.
[1033.70 --> 1034.02]  Their.
[1034.36 --> 1037.72]  Their testimony would be considered untrustworthy.
[1037.72 --> 1040.38]  They are invited to see that.
[1040.90 --> 1042.80]  The deliverer was like them.
[1043.24 --> 1045.16]  They are allowed to worship him.
[1045.92 --> 1047.24]  And then here's the irony.
[1047.58 --> 1047.72]  Look.
[1047.78 --> 1049.02]  Look at verse 17.
[1049.42 --> 1049.88]  And 18.
[1050.04 --> 1050.12]  Of.
[1050.48 --> 1051.28]  Of that chapter.
[1052.18 --> 1052.46]  Of.
[1052.82 --> 1053.70]  Luke's gospel.
[1053.86 --> 1053.98]  It said.
[1053.98 --> 1055.04]  When they had seen him.
[1055.10 --> 1055.94]  We read in verse 17.
[1056.04 --> 1057.16]  They spread the word.
[1057.16 --> 1058.24]  They spread the word.
[1058.64 --> 1060.54]  Concerning what had been told them about this child.
[1060.86 --> 1062.20]  And all who heard it were amazed.
[1062.50 --> 1063.44]  At what the shepherds.
[1063.82 --> 1064.94]  Said to them.
[1064.94 --> 1067.60]  They.
[1068.16 --> 1069.62]  Who were not allowed.
[1069.62 --> 1071.58]  To be witnesses in a court of law.
[1071.82 --> 1073.14]  Are invited by God.
[1073.22 --> 1074.82]  To become the first witnesses.
[1075.26 --> 1076.88]  Of his grand story.
[1077.10 --> 1077.88]  Of redemption.
[1078.20 --> 1078.96]  And salvation.
[1079.54 --> 1080.42]  And these shepherds.
[1080.48 --> 1081.86]  Tell everyone they meet.
[1082.90 --> 1083.84]  Prompting amazement.
[1086.02 --> 1086.98]  People are thinking.
[1087.16 --> 1087.26]  You know.
[1087.54 --> 1089.12]  These outcasts.
[1089.16 --> 1090.38]  They act like they belong.
[1092.06 --> 1093.08]  Because they do.
[1094.94 --> 1096.90]  They receive the good news.
[1097.40 --> 1099.66]  That God has come to them.
[1099.88 --> 1101.06]  In their lives.
[1101.14 --> 1101.86]  To bring hope.
[1101.92 --> 1102.40]  And joy.
[1102.52 --> 1103.02]  And peace.
[1103.02 --> 1104.02]  And restoration.
[1107.62 --> 1109.22]  This is such a strong theme.
[1109.38 --> 1109.94]  In the gospel.
[1110.06 --> 1110.80]  It's interesting to me.
[1110.86 --> 1111.64]  That later in Luke.
[1111.88 --> 1112.46]  Luke writes.
[1112.82 --> 1113.64]  About Jesus.
[1113.78 --> 1114.48]  Thanking God.
[1114.62 --> 1115.00]  For something.
[1115.12 --> 1115.96]  And look at it with me.
[1116.02 --> 1116.70]  Luke 10.
[1117.10 --> 1117.38]  It says.
[1117.48 --> 1118.34]  At that time.
[1118.34 --> 1119.46]  Jesus.
[1119.80 --> 1120.94]  Full of joy.
[1120.94 --> 1122.10]  Through the Holy Spirit.
[1122.24 --> 1122.48]  Said.
[1122.72 --> 1123.80]  I praise you Father.
[1123.80 --> 1124.90]  Lord of heaven and earth.
[1125.12 --> 1127.28]  Because you have hidden these things.
[1127.50 --> 1128.20]  This is the gospel.
[1128.42 --> 1128.86]  Good news.
[1129.08 --> 1129.80]  From the wise.
[1129.88 --> 1130.26]  And the learned.
[1130.44 --> 1132.12]  And revealed them to little children.
[1132.56 --> 1133.14]  Yes Father.
[1133.54 --> 1135.68]  For this is what you were pleased to do.
[1135.88 --> 1136.88]  And then we jump ahead again.
[1136.88 --> 1137.18]  In Luke.
[1137.20 --> 1137.90]  In Luke 18.
[1138.22 --> 1138.68]  Jesus says.
[1138.76 --> 1140.10]  Truly I tell you.
[1140.56 --> 1142.74]  Anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God.
[1142.80 --> 1143.50]  Like a little child.
[1143.64 --> 1144.58]  Will never enter it.
[1144.58 --> 1150.58]  Like one.
[1152.40 --> 1153.70]  Who has no power.
[1155.24 --> 1156.48]  Like one who's.
[1156.80 --> 1158.42]  Not particularly in charge.
[1159.56 --> 1160.80]  In the simplicity.
[1161.30 --> 1163.02]  Of surrender and acceptance.
[1163.46 --> 1164.00]  They come.
[1164.26 --> 1165.34]  Childlike in sense.
[1167.06 --> 1167.56]  You know.
[1167.68 --> 1168.44]  I love.
[1169.10 --> 1169.92]  How Mary.
[1170.06 --> 1170.26]  You know.
[1170.30 --> 1171.60]  When she first hears the news of her.
[1172.12 --> 1173.00]  Miraculous pregnancy.
[1173.18 --> 1173.52]  She says.
[1173.62 --> 1174.54]  How can this be?
[1174.58 --> 1175.76]  And it's a great question.
[1176.08 --> 1176.94]  How can this be?
[1177.22 --> 1178.12]  But soon after.
[1178.24 --> 1178.60]  She says.
[1178.64 --> 1179.16]  Very soon after.
[1179.20 --> 1179.46]  She says.
[1179.86 --> 1180.94]  Let it be.
[1182.76 --> 1183.56]  Let it be.
[1184.32 --> 1185.60]  Has she figured it all out yet?
[1185.68 --> 1185.84]  No.
[1185.90 --> 1186.06]  No.
[1186.24 --> 1186.42]  No.
[1186.42 --> 1186.48]  No.
[1186.60 --> 1188.10]  But we go from questions.
[1188.20 --> 1188.88]  Which is fine.
[1189.06 --> 1191.22]  I don't mind that we all have questions sometimes.
[1191.56 --> 1192.72]  But we go from questions.
[1193.16 --> 1194.30]  To surrender.
[1195.66 --> 1196.34]  To surrender.
[1197.74 --> 1200.00]  Knowing that we don't often know.
[1200.00 --> 1200.50]  You know.
[1200.50 --> 1201.34]  You know.
[1201.34 --> 1203.46]  You know.
[1203.54 --> 1204.44]  I think sometimes we.
[1204.56 --> 1206.12]  We try to be way too smart.
[1207.62 --> 1208.62]  And we're not.
[1210.62 --> 1211.72]  We're just kids.
[1213.18 --> 1214.86]  And our father knows best.
[1217.26 --> 1218.26]  These shepherds.
[1218.32 --> 1218.80]  They leave.
[1219.30 --> 1219.86]  Changed.
[1220.12 --> 1221.32]  By what they had experienced.
[1221.58 --> 1222.10]  And witnessed.
[1222.60 --> 1223.66]  And thus became.
[1223.88 --> 1224.28]  A witness.
[1224.60 --> 1224.98]  For others.
[1224.98 --> 1229.40]  Let me encourage you.
[1230.34 --> 1231.08]  Be a witness.
[1231.22 --> 1232.34]  Out of that same place.
[1233.70 --> 1235.06]  The angels go back.
[1235.24 --> 1236.56]  From where they came.
[1237.28 --> 1237.54]  Right.
[1237.60 --> 1238.16]  Back to heaven.
[1238.70 --> 1239.66]  And the shepherds.
[1239.82 --> 1240.72]  Then go forth.
[1242.08 --> 1242.32]  They.
[1242.78 --> 1243.22]  They.
[1243.22 --> 1244.58]  They didn't just stop.
[1244.68 --> 1245.22]  At the manger.
[1245.36 --> 1245.48]  And say.
[1245.56 --> 1245.70]  Oh.
[1245.84 --> 1246.06]  What a.
[1246.14 --> 1247.42]  What a wonderful story.
[1247.74 --> 1249.40]  Somehow it sends them out.
[1249.72 --> 1251.02]  Jesus has come.
[1252.02 --> 1252.62]  And then.
[1252.62 --> 1253.54]  Then we surrender.
[1253.72 --> 1254.04]  To that.
[1254.24 --> 1254.84]  His coming.
[1254.98 --> 1255.76]  To his presence.
[1255.90 --> 1256.74]  To what he brings us.
[1256.92 --> 1258.10]  And then we witness.
[1258.28 --> 1258.98]  To the good news.
[1259.34 --> 1260.42]  We experience.
[1260.86 --> 1261.40]  In him.
[1263.16 --> 1264.34]  These are the first people.
[1264.44 --> 1265.02]  That God invites.
[1265.10 --> 1265.96]  To become his witnesses.
[1266.24 --> 1267.48]  These outcasts.
[1271.32 --> 1271.72]  Maybe.
[1273.66 --> 1274.06]  Maybe.
[1274.06 --> 1274.86]  Maybe you feel like.
[1274.98 --> 1276.16]  Like you have nothing to offer.
[1276.26 --> 1277.08]  In sharing the good news.
[1279.24 --> 1280.78]  And I want to encourage you.
[1280.88 --> 1282.22]  God just calls you.
[1282.22 --> 1282.96]  To be you.
[1282.96 --> 1283.06]  To be you.
[1284.26 --> 1284.86]  That's all.
[1284.86 --> 1284.88]  That's all.
[1285.52 --> 1286.98]  And then to experience him.
[1287.06 --> 1287.60]  In his presence.
[1288.42 --> 1289.00]  And then.
[1289.20 --> 1289.84]  Live that out.
[1290.00 --> 1291.46]  And live that out in words.
[1291.62 --> 1292.64]  And live that out in deeds.
[1292.72 --> 1293.32]  And in prayers.
[1293.62 --> 1293.78]  I mean.
[1293.84 --> 1295.34]  Maybe your small contributions.
[1295.56 --> 1296.56]  Are encouraging notes.
[1296.84 --> 1296.92]  Or.
[1297.12 --> 1297.42]  Or.
[1297.42 --> 1298.34]  Or text.
[1298.42 --> 1299.42]  Or you call somebody.
[1299.54 --> 1299.62]  Or.
[1299.78 --> 1300.64]  You're there for them.
[1300.68 --> 1302.10]  Or you help them out when they're struggling.
[1302.24 --> 1303.18]  But maybe financially.
[1303.48 --> 1305.34]  Somehow there's all kinds of ways.
[1305.34 --> 1306.16]  To be.
[1306.16 --> 1307.92]  And bring good news.
[1309.38 --> 1310.36]  Let me encourage you.
[1310.40 --> 1311.52]  God will use that.
[1311.70 --> 1313.16]  He will use you.
[1314.70 --> 1315.62]  To bring.
[1316.54 --> 1317.78]  His good news.
[1317.94 --> 1318.72]  To all.
[1319.26 --> 1319.58]  People.
[1319.76 --> 1320.50]  Not you particularly.
[1321.30 --> 1322.70]  You're going to rub shoulders.
[1322.94 --> 1323.40]  With some.
[1324.06 --> 1324.54]  People.
[1324.82 --> 1326.16]  I don't mean rub shoulders.
[1326.24 --> 1326.56]  Literally.
[1326.76 --> 1327.54]  Not in this time of COVID.
[1327.96 --> 1328.44]  But anyways.
[1328.96 --> 1330.22]  Let me ask you this question.
[1330.32 --> 1332.18]  Is there an outcast.
[1332.18 --> 1332.26]  Outcast.
[1332.90 --> 1334.16]  That you know of.
[1335.86 --> 1336.86]  Someone who feels.
[1336.96 --> 1338.02]  Like they don't belong.
[1342.22 --> 1343.24]  We all feel like.
[1343.44 --> 1344.34]  Outcasts sometimes.
[1349.92 --> 1350.68]  We have.
[1355.28 --> 1355.84]  You know.
[1356.02 --> 1357.58]  Our kids in Winnipeg.
[1357.78 --> 1358.54]  Had a rough time.
[1359.00 --> 1359.66]  Recently where.
[1362.18 --> 1363.00]  A loved one.
[1363.26 --> 1363.84]  Someone close.
[1363.96 --> 1364.54]  Passed away.
[1366.14 --> 1367.62]  Due to a fentanyl overdose.
[1372.48 --> 1373.58]  I was watching the news.
[1373.62 --> 1374.02]  The other day.
[1374.24 --> 1375.30]  And there was this.
[1375.54 --> 1376.52]  First Nations man.
[1379.52 --> 1380.58]  From Prince George.
[1380.90 --> 1381.56]  And he.
[1382.52 --> 1383.30]  Made it a point.
[1383.40 --> 1384.68]  To regularly come from Prince George.
[1384.74 --> 1385.38]  Into Vancouver.
[1386.00 --> 1387.36]  To wander the streets.
[1387.42 --> 1388.26]  In the back alleys.
[1389.46 --> 1390.20]  And he said.
[1390.26 --> 1390.82]  These are his words.
[1390.94 --> 1391.98]  Looking for his people.
[1392.18 --> 1394.84]  Of his tribe.
[1394.88 --> 1395.94]  I don't remember what tribe it was.
[1396.14 --> 1397.50]  But he went specifically.
[1397.68 --> 1398.60]  To look for his people.
[1400.34 --> 1401.94]  And his mission was this.
[1402.42 --> 1402.66]  We.
[1402.84 --> 1403.54]  We want.
[1403.54 --> 1404.38]  Our people.
[1404.60 --> 1405.06]  To know.
[1405.54 --> 1405.92]  That the.
[1406.48 --> 1407.42]  His people.
[1407.60 --> 1408.66]  Are looking for them.
[1410.28 --> 1411.36]  And he found.
[1411.52 --> 1411.98]  He found.
[1412.18 --> 1412.94]  A young man.
[1413.20 --> 1414.26]  From their tribe.
[1414.64 --> 1415.54]  And he convinced him.
[1415.58 --> 1416.34]  To come back with him.
[1416.36 --> 1417.34]  And he got into treatment.
[1417.54 --> 1417.64]  And.
[1417.96 --> 1418.86]  And they had.
[1418.96 --> 1419.90]  Had him on the news.
[1420.02 --> 1420.52]  And he was.
[1420.64 --> 1421.28]  Eight months sober.
[1422.18 --> 1423.22]  And.
[1423.22 --> 1424.40]  And it just struck me.
[1424.84 --> 1424.96]  That.
[1425.16 --> 1425.78]  That we all.
[1425.96 --> 1427.16]  Want to be told.
[1428.28 --> 1429.34]  That our people.
[1429.50 --> 1430.42]  Are looking for us.
[1434.18 --> 1435.34]  That's the church.
[1437.34 --> 1438.38]  Our people.
[1438.88 --> 1439.30]  Are looking.
[1439.56 --> 1440.08]  For us.
[1445.08 --> 1445.44]  Somehow.
[1445.44 --> 1446.52]  And.
[1446.52 --> 1447.16]  That young man.
[1447.26 --> 1448.26]  It made such a difference.
[1448.70 --> 1449.74]  And I think it makes a difference.
[1449.90 --> 1450.62]  In all of our lives.
[1450.74 --> 1451.26]  When we know.
[1451.74 --> 1452.86]  There's someone looking for us.
[1454.18 --> 1454.58]  And.
[1454.70 --> 1456.52]  And you and I just need to tell someone.
[1456.88 --> 1457.18]  That the.
[1457.26 --> 1459.12]  That the light has shone in your life.
[1459.16 --> 1460.72]  And it can shine in theirs too.
[1461.18 --> 1461.58]  We.
[1462.10 --> 1462.54]  Belong.
[1463.22 --> 1463.58]  Because.
[1463.78 --> 1465.12]  Jesus has come to us.
[1465.28 --> 1466.20]  As we are.
[1466.38 --> 1467.60]  And we need to tell others.
[1467.82 --> 1468.44]  You belong.
[1468.44 --> 1468.94]  You belong.
[1468.94 --> 1474.98]  As you are.
[1477.98 --> 1478.28]  You know.
[1478.46 --> 1479.78]  I read a quote recently.
[1479.88 --> 1480.08]  It said.
[1480.20 --> 1481.24]  Grace is like water.
[1481.36 --> 1482.66]  It flows downhill.
[1482.98 --> 1485.12]  And pools up in the lowest places.
[1487.40 --> 1488.52]  Grace is like water.
[1488.60 --> 1489.36]  It flows downhill.
[1489.36 --> 1490.92]  And it pools in the lowest places.
[1491.32 --> 1492.12]  And I've asked you.
[1492.20 --> 1492.40]  You know.
[1492.40 --> 1493.26]  Where's your lowest places?
[1493.38 --> 1494.72]  Because that's where grace is showing up.
[1494.72 --> 1498.60]  And then go ahead and come.
[1498.84 --> 1499.06]  You know.
[1499.20 --> 1500.20]  Come to that manger.
[1500.36 --> 1501.02]  Take a look.
[1501.12 --> 1501.36]  Look.
[1501.44 --> 1502.32]  Look deeply there.
[1502.64 --> 1504.06]  Look with all your questions.
[1504.18 --> 1505.00]  And all your doubts.
[1507.38 --> 1507.78]  Look.
[1508.14 --> 1509.74]  With all your brokenness.
[1509.78 --> 1510.80]  And all your messiness.
[1511.10 --> 1513.56]  Go and see the one who has come.
[1513.90 --> 1515.66]  And is like you.
[1516.62 --> 1518.68]  The one who has stepped into the mess.
[1518.68 --> 1521.72]  Who has stepped into being an outcast.
[1521.86 --> 1523.10]  With the rest of us.
[1523.10 --> 1525.96]  Because he longs to bring you life.
[1526.04 --> 1526.84]  Life in all its fullness.
[1526.94 --> 1527.80]  As he describes it.
[1531.80 --> 1532.22]  You know.
[1532.28 --> 1532.92]  And these shepherds.
[1535.28 --> 1536.08]  Then they went.
[1537.64 --> 1538.54]  And then they saw.
[1538.60 --> 1539.48]  And I picture these shepherds.
[1539.54 --> 1540.10]  I wonder how they felt.
[1540.20 --> 1541.84]  They saw Jesus.
[1542.14 --> 1543.04]  The lamb of God.
[1545.72 --> 1547.22]  The lamb that would be sacrificed.
[1547.22 --> 1550.72]  To bring them actual and permanent purification.
[1550.72 --> 1553.36]  The one who will cleanse them.
[1554.06 --> 1556.22]  And give them the wholeness they long for.
[1558.14 --> 1559.46]  I'd just like to finish off.
[1559.52 --> 1559.98]  With reading.
[1560.24 --> 1561.50]  Revelation 7.17.
[1561.62 --> 1563.34]  We sang a little bit about it at one point too.
[1565.26 --> 1566.20]  Where John writes.
[1567.48 --> 1568.42]  And you picture this.
[1569.42 --> 1570.42]  For the lamb.
[1570.56 --> 1572.12]  At the center of the throne.
[1572.12 --> 1576.28]  Will be their shepherd.
[1579.28 --> 1580.90]  And picture that.
[1581.02 --> 1581.72]  Think about that.
[1583.04 --> 1584.18]  The lamb.
[1584.70 --> 1585.82]  One of the flock.
[1587.10 --> 1587.70]  Young.
[1588.28 --> 1590.10]  Is somehow the shepherd.
[1591.38 --> 1592.64]  That sounds crazy.
[1593.98 --> 1595.92]  One who is like us.
[1596.44 --> 1597.88]  Is our shepherd.
[1597.88 --> 1599.66]  And he will lead them.
[1599.66 --> 1599.90]  Where?
[1600.10 --> 1602.16]  To springs of living water.
[1602.98 --> 1603.90]  What a beautiful image.
[1604.06 --> 1604.94]  Particularly if you're a shepherd.
[1606.46 --> 1608.10]  You'll get the drink you need.
[1609.04 --> 1609.66]  And then this.
[1609.74 --> 1611.24]  And God will wipe every tear.
[1611.80 --> 1612.74]  From your eyes.
[1612.94 --> 1613.54]  From their eyes.
[1615.92 --> 1616.40]  Together.
[1616.84 --> 1617.80]  We walk.
[1618.88 --> 1619.66]  In that light.
[1619.80 --> 1620.60]  In the light of Jesus.
[1621.66 --> 1623.26]  Knowing we are cleansed.
[1623.30 --> 1624.18]  No matter how messy.
[1625.12 --> 1627.04]  Knowing he gives us living water.
[1627.04 --> 1629.86]  And we are no longer outcasts.
[1630.12 --> 1632.08]  We belong with the King of Kings.
[1632.08 --> 1632.98]  And the Lord of Lords.
[1633.36 --> 1634.12]  Now and forever.
[1634.86 --> 1636.76]  And we need to go in his name.
[1637.44 --> 1638.46]  And share that good news.
[1639.54 --> 1640.12]  Let's pray.
