[0.00 --> 9.00]  Good morning.
[10.06 --> 10.90]  Good morning.
[14.48 --> 16.60]  It's good to be with all of you this morning,
[16.96 --> 19.90]  here and also online.
[21.12 --> 26.74]  We're into this series of Paul's letter to the Thessalonians,
[26.74 --> 30.88]  and so I'm going to begin with that.
[30.98 --> 32.68]  So let's look at our passage for today.
[33.30 --> 37.36]  We're reading out of 1 Thessalonians 4, the verses 1 through 8.
[37.46 --> 40.08]  It'll be up on the screen, and if you have your Bible,
[40.32 --> 41.22]  you can look it up as well.
[42.56 --> 43.62]  Where Paul writes,
[44.82 --> 47.38]  As for other matters, brothers and sisters,
[48.04 --> 51.40]  we instructed you how to live in order to please God
[51.40 --> 53.70]  as, in fact, you are living.
[53.70 --> 57.28]  And now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus
[57.28 --> 60.30]  to do this more and more.
[60.98 --> 62.86]  I like that phrase. Keep it in mind.
[63.66 --> 65.48]  For you know what instructions we gave you
[65.48 --> 67.02]  by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
[67.94 --> 70.56]  It is God's will that you should be sanctified.
[70.88 --> 72.50]  And there's that in a way that the more and the more
[72.50 --> 74.32]  and the sanctified are the same thing.
[74.60 --> 77.04]  That you should avoid sexual immorality.
[77.86 --> 80.64]  That each of you should learn to control your own body
[80.64 --> 83.08]  in a way that is holy and honorable.
[83.08 --> 87.58]  Not in passionate lust like the pagans who do not know God.
[88.20 --> 89.66]  And that is, in this matter,
[89.78 --> 93.34]  no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister.
[93.98 --> 96.36]  The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins
[96.36 --> 99.36]  as we told you and warned you before.
[100.16 --> 102.12]  For God did not call us to be impure,
[103.16 --> 105.04]  but to live a holy life.
[105.40 --> 107.40]  And therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction
[107.40 --> 109.56]  does not reject a human being,
[110.44 --> 113.78]  but God, the very God who gives you His Holy Spirit.
[115.86 --> 117.72]  On first read of that passage,
[118.92 --> 121.52]  I thought, well, that's pretty straightforward, right?
[123.10 --> 123.96]  Please God.
[124.36 --> 125.28]  Okay, got it.
[125.52 --> 127.12]  You know, careful with sex.
[127.78 --> 128.20]  Got it.
[128.64 --> 129.80]  You know, pretty straightforward.
[129.80 --> 131.94]  Kind of like going to a movie
[131.94 --> 133.58]  and knowing what to expect,
[133.70 --> 134.70]  and there were no surprises.
[136.08 --> 137.80]  But as I read the passage
[137.80 --> 139.72]  and reflected more and more on it,
[139.76 --> 141.54]  which is what we do as pastors
[141.54 --> 143.36]  that are trying to prepare for these moments,
[143.80 --> 146.58]  it felt like something changed in me.
[146.72 --> 148.80]  It felt like I'm now at a movie,
[149.56 --> 152.26]  and I was expecting not to be surprised,
[152.26 --> 155.90]  and then as I unpacked this movie and saw it,
[156.50 --> 160.46]  my life was changed by the movie at the very end,
[160.62 --> 162.48]  and I was changed somehow.
[164.28 --> 165.66]  Somehow this phrase,
[165.90 --> 166.64]  please God,
[166.70 --> 169.32]  has kind of resonated with me all week,
[169.78 --> 172.58]  and I've just been savoring that phrase
[172.58 --> 173.40]  and what it means.
[173.80 --> 175.90]  Living sanctified lives.
[176.00 --> 177.34]  You know, we can throw around
[177.34 --> 178.84]  the religious terminology,
[179.42 --> 181.62]  but what does it mean to my life
[181.62 --> 182.84]  and how I live?
[184.04 --> 185.42]  I mean, sanctified really is
[185.42 --> 187.88]  all those things that make you more Christ-like.
[189.24 --> 190.42]  And those could be struggles,
[190.68 --> 191.76]  those could be triumphs,
[191.76 --> 192.66]  those could be all kinds of things,
[192.70 --> 194.58]  but all those things that make you Christ-like.
[195.60 --> 196.98]  And Paul talks about that.
[197.10 --> 198.74]  He says that that's what he wants
[198.74 --> 200.18]  for the Thessalonians.
[200.68 --> 202.44]  And then in that context,
[202.54 --> 202.80]  he said,
[202.88 --> 204.74]  avoid sexual immorality.
[206.10 --> 206.98]  All right, well,
[207.18 --> 208.74]  what's sexual immorality here?
[208.74 --> 209.46]  Well,
[210.66 --> 212.10]  there's two ways
[212.10 --> 214.66]  of approaching this issue of sex,
[215.20 --> 216.78]  which is what we're going to spend some time
[216.78 --> 217.56]  talking about this morning
[217.56 --> 219.40]  in addition to much more.
[219.86 --> 220.66]  First off,
[221.00 --> 223.10]  this can be a problematic issue,
[223.42 --> 225.04]  or it can be a pathway
[225.04 --> 226.14]  to sanctification.
[228.20 --> 229.66]  The Thessalonians live in a culture
[229.66 --> 230.20]  that said,
[230.44 --> 231.92]  who is to say
[231.92 --> 233.50]  what is moral
[233.50 --> 234.42]  and what is immoral?
[234.42 --> 236.68]  And that should sound
[236.68 --> 237.86]  rather familiar to us.
[237.98 --> 238.12]  You know,
[238.22 --> 240.02]  we have this idea too
[240.02 --> 240.68]  in our culture,
[241.14 --> 241.34]  you know,
[241.44 --> 242.76]  you get to decide
[242.76 --> 244.28]  what your right and wrong is.
[244.52 --> 245.52]  It's all up to you.
[246.16 --> 248.36]  But Paul uses this word here
[248.36 --> 249.46]  for sexual immorality,
[249.98 --> 251.02]  and that word,
[251.14 --> 251.70]  it's a Greek word,
[251.84 --> 252.42]  it's pornea.
[253.78 --> 254.74]  You can hear that
[254.74 --> 257.02]  we get our word pornography from it.
[257.38 --> 258.28]  But translated,
[258.52 --> 259.58]  it really simply means
[259.58 --> 260.56]  any relationships
[260.56 --> 261.76]  out of the context
[261.76 --> 263.54]  of a covenant marriage.
[264.42 --> 265.62]  That's what it is.
[265.94 --> 266.78]  And Paul says,
[267.04 --> 268.58]  stay away from this.
[269.06 --> 269.18]  You know,
[269.20 --> 269.46]  he says,
[269.54 --> 271.10]  you see this in the world around you,
[271.40 --> 272.26]  avoid it.
[273.36 --> 274.06]  Now we might ask,
[274.14 --> 274.60]  well, why?
[275.04 --> 275.36]  Why?
[276.62 --> 278.36]  Now we're back to these pathways,
[278.58 --> 279.08]  these two paths.
[279.40 --> 279.84]  Why?
[280.00 --> 280.96]  Because it works
[280.96 --> 282.64]  against sanctification.
[282.82 --> 284.42]  It works against your holiness.
[285.02 --> 285.34]  Sex,
[285.86 --> 287.80]  a pathway to sanctification.
[288.38 --> 288.68]  Yes.
[289.20 --> 289.54]  Sex,
[289.86 --> 291.94]  a pathway away from sanctification.
[291.94 --> 294.32]  Those are the options here.
[295.30 --> 296.76]  And it goes a little further than that.
[296.94 --> 297.46]  When we read,
[297.66 --> 298.84]  and I'll reread it to you,
[298.92 --> 299.64]  in verse 6,
[300.68 --> 302.56]  we can read here,
[302.86 --> 304.08]  let me get the glasses on.
[306.32 --> 307.10]  There we go.
[307.36 --> 307.88]  Where it says,
[308.04 --> 308.86]  and this is a matter
[308.86 --> 311.92]  that no one should wrong
[311.92 --> 312.62]  or take advantage
[312.62 --> 313.60]  of a brother or sister.
[314.78 --> 316.80]  Paul takes this issue of sex,
[316.84 --> 317.24]  and he says,
[317.52 --> 319.10]  there's a communal component
[319.10 --> 321.00]  to this whole thing too.
[321.00 --> 323.50]  It's not just you.
[324.62 --> 325.88]  It's not just you.
[326.34 --> 328.00]  Uncontrolled sexual desires
[328.00 --> 329.36]  divide people.
[330.04 --> 331.30]  Obviously in marriage,
[331.46 --> 333.06]  that makes sense to all of us,
[333.20 --> 335.14]  but also in society at large.
[336.28 --> 338.08]  The way we view sex
[338.08 --> 339.30]  can be a huge division
[339.30 --> 340.72]  between men and women,
[340.84 --> 341.28]  for example.
[342.22 --> 342.90]  We can have issues
[342.90 --> 344.08]  of objectification,
[344.86 --> 346.22]  misusing people,
[346.74 --> 348.28]  dehumanizing people.
[348.50 --> 349.26]  All of those
[349.26 --> 352.28]  can divide society at large.
[352.76 --> 354.34]  It can warp our view
[354.34 --> 355.52]  of one another.
[357.22 --> 357.92]  And I think I see
[357.92 --> 359.28]  a lot of examples of that
[359.28 --> 360.52]  often in our society.
[360.98 --> 362.22]  It also can create
[362.22 --> 362.96]  a lot of shame
[362.96 --> 363.80]  and confusion.
[365.02 --> 366.26]  I think we live in an age
[366.26 --> 367.34]  where there is a lot of that.
[368.70 --> 369.66]  And Paul says,
[369.78 --> 371.22]  God judges this.
[371.38 --> 372.42]  What is he judging?
[372.42 --> 374.14]  He judges that
[374.14 --> 376.08]  which harms and divides.
[377.70 --> 378.52]  And I want a God
[378.52 --> 380.00]  who doesn't want us
[380.00 --> 381.08]  to harm and divide
[381.08 --> 381.86]  amongst ourselves.
[382.26 --> 383.72]  Because he longs
[383.72 --> 384.22]  for people
[384.22 --> 385.24]  to live holy lives.
[385.46 --> 386.30]  To live lives
[386.30 --> 387.20]  that the creator,
[387.54 --> 388.30]  the holy one,
[388.40 --> 389.38]  created us to live
[389.38 --> 391.32]  according to his design.
[392.46 --> 393.66]  And so Paul is saying here,
[393.92 --> 395.18]  choose the path
[395.18 --> 395.70]  of holiness.
[396.46 --> 397.32]  This shows up
[397.32 --> 398.08]  in how you live,
[398.84 --> 399.64]  including the way
[399.64 --> 400.52]  you treat your body,
[400.64 --> 401.88]  including how you view sex.
[401.88 --> 402.76]  And the reason
[402.76 --> 404.28]  Paul specifies sex
[404.28 --> 405.60]  is because it's an issue
[405.60 --> 406.52]  for the Thessalonians.
[407.92 --> 408.66]  We've got a lot of stuff
[408.66 --> 409.54]  going on sexually.
[409.80 --> 411.38]  There are temple prostitutes.
[411.98 --> 413.06]  We can hardly imagine
[413.06 --> 414.30]  that that would be the case,
[414.36 --> 414.82]  but they did.
[416.34 --> 417.80]  Mistresses were commonplace.
[418.52 --> 419.22]  There was an attitude
[419.22 --> 421.14]  of doing whatever you want.
[421.72 --> 424.50]  Feeling like you define life
[424.50 --> 425.68]  by your wants
[425.68 --> 426.52]  and your desires.
[427.16 --> 427.96]  And it made me think
[427.96 --> 430.00]  of an old song lyric
[430.00 --> 430.46]  that said,
[430.46 --> 432.22]  how can it be wrong
[432.22 --> 434.62]  when it feels so right?
[436.12 --> 437.82]  Which is stupidity
[437.82 --> 438.66]  in terms of logic.
[439.88 --> 440.20]  It just,
[440.56 --> 440.82]  you know,
[440.88 --> 441.50]  we think,
[441.58 --> 442.48]  oh, what a lovely line.
[442.56 --> 443.02]  No, no,
[443.02 --> 443.72]  it's not a lovely line.
[443.76 --> 444.24]  It's stupid.
[445.32 --> 446.78]  And let's be honest here.
[447.90 --> 448.70]  This issue,
[448.84 --> 449.34]  which was an issue
[449.34 --> 450.36]  for the Thessalonians,
[450.58 --> 451.48]  is an issue
[451.48 --> 453.50]  in our world as well.
[453.72 --> 454.66]  And Paul asked,
[454.70 --> 455.56]  he's really asking them,
[455.60 --> 456.72]  and he's asking us as well,
[456.72 --> 458.20]  where are your wants?
[458.32 --> 459.46]  Where are your lusts?
[459.60 --> 460.94]  Where are they taking you?
[461.08 --> 461.68]  Because he says,
[462.02 --> 464.30]  if you want to control,
[465.06 --> 466.22]  or you should be controlling
[466.22 --> 466.76]  your wants,
[466.82 --> 467.56]  you should be controlling
[467.56 --> 469.06]  your lusts and your desires,
[469.20 --> 470.68]  or they're going to control you.
[472.76 --> 474.50]  And then back to his main point,
[474.58 --> 475.88]  which seems also obvious
[475.88 --> 476.36]  in a way,
[476.42 --> 477.08]  and yet it's not.
[477.58 --> 478.28]  He goes back,
[478.32 --> 479.08]  and his main point says,
[479.32 --> 480.86]  please God.
[481.86 --> 482.58]  Please God.
[482.58 --> 485.30]  Not this self-centered part of you
[485.30 --> 488.14]  that could be destroying you
[488.14 --> 489.56]  in its self-centeredness.
[491.00 --> 491.82]  It's interesting,
[492.08 --> 492.80]  in Thessalonica,
[493.06 --> 494.22]  women were commanded
[494.22 --> 496.00]  to be faithful to their husbands.
[498.40 --> 500.70]  Men, not so much.
[502.06 --> 504.10]  Affairs were to be expected.
[505.06 --> 506.82]  And Paul here is addressing
[506.82 --> 508.90]  all of you.
[509.26 --> 510.42]  Here's the bar.
[510.86 --> 511.92]  Please God.
[511.92 --> 513.12]  God, this is the bar.
[513.26 --> 514.90]  This is where we all need to be.
[515.26 --> 516.44]  You need to be faithful,
[516.74 --> 518.24]  all of you, male, female,
[518.66 --> 519.56]  to your creator,
[519.86 --> 521.22]  to the one who is faithful,
[521.60 --> 523.16]  and then you are faithful
[523.16 --> 524.08]  to one another.
[526.02 --> 526.84]  It made me think a little bit
[526.84 --> 528.06]  about how when Jesus asked
[528.06 --> 528.94]  what is the greatest law,
[529.00 --> 530.28]  and we read in Luke 10,
[530.68 --> 531.42]  Jesus answered,
[531.58 --> 532.36]  love the Lord your God
[532.36 --> 532.96]  with all your heart,
[533.02 --> 533.52]  with all your soul,
[533.62 --> 534.18]  with all your strength,
[534.20 --> 534.80]  with all your mind.
[534.94 --> 535.08]  Right?
[535.14 --> 535.68]  There's the creator.
[536.20 --> 537.80]  And out of that comes love,
[538.16 --> 540.08]  love of neighbor and yourself.
[541.10 --> 541.50]  Right?
[541.50 --> 543.52]  There's almost this trickle-down effect.
[543.86 --> 545.70]  You are faithful to the creator,
[546.16 --> 547.34]  and then that faithfulness
[547.34 --> 547.84]  and that love
[547.84 --> 549.40]  trickle down into your relationships,
[549.72 --> 550.74]  and then it trickles down
[550.74 --> 551.86]  even into love of self.
[555.96 --> 558.38]  Sexuality can be a place
[558.38 --> 560.44]  of much pleasure and much good,
[560.96 --> 562.46]  a good gift from the creator.
[562.46 --> 564.66]  I don't know if I'm going to get you
[564.66 --> 565.30]  to shout amen,
[565.46 --> 566.34]  but that might sound weird.
[568.50 --> 572.48]  To be enjoyed at the creator's design.
[574.24 --> 574.96]  In scripture,
[575.96 --> 577.60]  when we speak of sex,
[577.88 --> 579.28]  the one phrase that comes up
[579.28 --> 580.76]  is one flesh.
[581.56 --> 583.26]  We read it in Genesis 3.24,
[583.36 --> 583.90]  right in the beginning,
[584.30 --> 585.46]  a man will leave his father
[585.46 --> 586.10]  and his mother,
[586.50 --> 587.92]  he's united to his wife,
[588.20 --> 589.96]  and then they become one flesh.
[589.96 --> 594.46]  It's talking about sex,
[595.20 --> 596.80]  but so much more.
[598.62 --> 600.04]  In the Hebrew language,
[600.38 --> 603.72]  there's about 7,000 words.
[604.36 --> 605.04]  In the English,
[605.20 --> 606.72]  there's a couple of hundred thousand.
[607.12 --> 609.88]  So Hebrew words are really layered.
[610.02 --> 611.68]  They cover a lot of ground.
[611.68 --> 614.54]  The word for one flesh
[614.54 --> 616.64]  comes out of the word ehad.
[617.64 --> 619.46]  Ehad, E-C-H-A-D.
[619.84 --> 621.22]  And it means oneness.
[621.64 --> 623.52]  The two shall be one.
[623.82 --> 625.44]  Two independent beings
[625.44 --> 628.00]  somehow entering oneness.
[629.96 --> 632.16]  This word is also a word
[632.16 --> 634.90]  that is used in one of the most important prayers
[634.90 --> 637.70]  in the Hebrew world,
[637.78 --> 638.68]  in the Jewish religion,
[639.24 --> 640.40]  called the shima.
[640.40 --> 643.08]  My wife and I went on a tour
[643.08 --> 644.62]  quite a number of years back,
[644.84 --> 646.00]  and our guide,
[646.12 --> 648.22]  we started each day with praying the shima.
[648.42 --> 649.70]  Here's how the shima starts.
[650.22 --> 651.16]  Hear, O Israel,
[651.62 --> 652.76]  the Lord our God,
[652.84 --> 654.94]  the Lord is one.
[656.04 --> 658.54]  The Lord is ehad.
[660.44 --> 661.66]  There's oneness.
[662.30 --> 664.50]  And it's the same word that Paul,
[664.98 --> 665.96]  or that in Genesis,
[666.22 --> 667.64]  we see the man and the woman
[667.64 --> 668.64]  shall be one flesh.
[669.00 --> 669.42]  Ehad.
[669.42 --> 671.46]  Man and women are ehad.
[671.56 --> 672.50]  There is oneness.
[672.82 --> 674.42]  They are, in a sense,
[674.64 --> 676.38]  like God as one.
[676.58 --> 678.54]  It is a picture of oneness.
[680.46 --> 682.06]  Marriage has a mission,
[682.48 --> 684.36]  and it is a mission to display
[684.36 --> 687.02]  the oneness of God somehow.
[689.14 --> 690.82]  It would be an interesting conversation
[690.82 --> 692.34]  for husbands and wives
[692.34 --> 693.00]  to sit down and say,
[693.10 --> 695.22]  okay, what does that mean for us?
[695.22 --> 698.72]  How does that change our thinking?
[700.30 --> 701.58]  You know, we live in a world
[701.58 --> 702.88]  that is not ehad.
[703.20 --> 704.56]  It is not one.
[704.66 --> 705.72]  It is fractured.
[705.80 --> 706.98]  That's what sin does.
[707.04 --> 707.68]  It is broken.
[707.92 --> 709.64]  We talk about broken homes.
[710.00 --> 711.20]  We talk about couples
[711.20 --> 712.94]  that have split.
[713.74 --> 714.72]  You hear the language.
[715.30 --> 716.26]  It's brokenness.
[716.34 --> 716.96]  It's divisiveness.
[716.96 --> 718.26]  And Paul says,
[718.70 --> 719.98]  sex is about oneness.
[720.66 --> 722.04]  But when it's misused,
[722.18 --> 722.80]  it divides.
[723.00 --> 723.96]  It fractures.
[724.38 --> 725.64]  When it is self-centered,
[725.96 --> 727.04]  there's no oneness.
[728.38 --> 729.38]  And then the gift of sex
[729.38 --> 730.78]  is used for all kinds of other things.
[730.94 --> 732.06]  Sex used as power.
[732.42 --> 733.42]  Sex as abuse.
[733.82 --> 734.90]  Sex used to shame.
[735.26 --> 736.36]  Sex used to get money.
[736.74 --> 737.90]  Sex used to exploit.
[738.32 --> 739.96]  Sex as addictive and enslaving.
[740.30 --> 741.82]  Sex just feeding your wants
[741.82 --> 742.78]  and your desires.
[746.06 --> 747.62]  And then there is no intimacy
[747.62 --> 750.32]  and no faithfulness
[750.32 --> 753.76]  and no sanctification.
[759.38 --> 760.56]  Note this here.
[760.72 --> 762.92]  Paul is not rebuking the Thessalonians.
[763.84 --> 765.60]  You can read some of Paul's other letters
[765.60 --> 766.54]  when he's rebuking
[766.54 --> 767.52]  and you'll see it.
[767.90 --> 769.74]  He's not rebuking them, right?
[769.94 --> 771.58]  He's basically encouraging them.
[771.58 --> 771.90]  And he's saying,
[772.30 --> 774.02]  keep fighting for the life
[774.02 --> 775.64]  God intended you to have.
[776.02 --> 779.56]  The only way that life works.
[779.64 --> 780.78]  The only way.
[782.70 --> 784.00]  Remember, Paul is holding up
[784.00 --> 785.14]  this church in Thessalonica
[785.14 --> 787.26]  as a model church.
[788.16 --> 789.66]  So being a model church
[789.66 --> 791.48]  doesn't mean being a perfect church.
[792.06 --> 793.44]  I want to remind you
[793.44 --> 796.02]  that we know our perfection
[796.02 --> 798.04]  is only found in Christ
[798.04 --> 799.08]  and His saving work.
[799.08 --> 802.52]  We are perfect in Christ.
[802.52 --> 804.16]  So we're not talking about that.
[804.42 --> 804.78]  But again,
[805.02 --> 806.38]  this more and more thing,
[806.50 --> 807.72]  this sanctification thing
[807.72 --> 808.38]  is going on here.
[808.72 --> 809.82]  And a model church
[809.82 --> 811.18]  and a model people,
[811.52 --> 812.14]  they are honest
[812.14 --> 814.68]  and they strive for Christ-likeness.
[814.68 --> 819.06]  And in that honesty,
[819.20 --> 820.06]  Paul challenges them.
[820.06 --> 820.62]  Thessalonians,
[820.72 --> 821.38]  what's driving you?
[822.76 --> 823.80]  What's driving you?
[824.42 --> 826.96]  And where is that going?
[828.44 --> 830.56]  Where is that taking you?
[830.80 --> 832.78]  Because it ends up somewhere
[832.78 --> 835.58]  and not where you expect.
[835.58 --> 837.84]  Paul is saying,
[838.02 --> 839.96]  is this about you and your wants
[839.96 --> 842.06]  or is this about pleasing God,
[842.26 --> 843.64]  the only pathway to life?
[846.74 --> 848.58]  The only way to live life
[848.58 --> 850.56]  is to follow the Creator's intents.
[851.98 --> 853.48]  And this happens throughout Scripture
[853.48 --> 855.22]  again and again and again.
[857.18 --> 858.68]  I could give many examples.
[858.80 --> 859.48]  I chose one.
[859.70 --> 861.04]  God speaking to the people of Israel
[861.04 --> 862.16]  in the book of Deuteronomy.
[862.16 --> 865.28]  Deuteronomy 30 verse 15.
[865.58 --> 867.12]  I used a New Living Translation.
[867.24 --> 867.92]  Let me read it to you.
[868.68 --> 869.76]  Where God said to the people,
[870.00 --> 871.56]  Today I give you the choice
[871.56 --> 873.60]  between life and death,
[874.50 --> 876.66]  between blessings and curses.
[877.44 --> 878.78]  Now I call on heaven and earth
[878.78 --> 880.60]  to witness the choice you make.
[881.10 --> 883.76]  Oh, and I hear the Creator's longing here.
[884.10 --> 886.96]  Oh, that you would choose life
[886.96 --> 891.02]  so that you and your descendants might live.
[891.02 --> 891.94]  And isn't that interesting?
[892.50 --> 894.68]  Your life choice somehow affects
[894.68 --> 897.42]  your kids and your kids' kids
[897.42 --> 898.70]  and so forth and so on.
[899.02 --> 901.46]  That goodness carries on generationally.
[903.86 --> 907.20]  Blessings, curses, life, death.
[909.90 --> 910.72]  I mean, let's face it.
[910.76 --> 912.58]  Our desires can be hijacked.
[912.66 --> 913.58]  Even our good ones,
[914.64 --> 915.56]  they can be hijacked.
[916.76 --> 918.52]  Sexual desires is a gift
[918.52 --> 920.38]  to bring oneness,
[920.38 --> 922.34]  to bring intimacy between husband and wife.
[922.42 --> 923.14]  That's God's intent.
[923.56 --> 924.74]  But it can be hijacked.
[925.14 --> 926.96]  It can be hijacked by self-centeredness.
[927.64 --> 930.10]  And then we get stuck in porn
[930.10 --> 931.94]  or affairs or abuse.
[932.16 --> 933.22]  And then it's not,
[933.32 --> 935.56]  it's not about pleasing God at that point.
[935.94 --> 936.78]  Only yourself.
[936.78 --> 941.84]  And, you know,
[941.92 --> 943.68]  we're using sex as an example here,
[943.74 --> 945.74]  but we could add all kinds of other wants
[945.74 --> 948.12]  and desires that can also be hijacked.
[949.46 --> 949.86]  Eating.
[949.86 --> 952.86]  Somehow that can be an act of selfishness.
[954.04 --> 955.52]  I'm not suggesting we shouldn't enjoy it,
[955.54 --> 955.82]  but I mean,
[955.90 --> 957.20]  it can get out of hand.
[957.54 --> 958.02]  Drinking.
[959.56 --> 960.56]  Being right.
[962.46 --> 962.94]  Buying.
[963.36 --> 963.72]  Working.
[963.98 --> 965.48]  All of those things can be hijacked.
[965.58 --> 967.14]  They can be done simply for yourself
[967.14 --> 968.26]  rather than,
[968.96 --> 971.08]  as they'd be seen as gifts from the Creator
[971.08 --> 973.22]  used to bless and please Him
[973.22 --> 974.62]  and to bless other people.
[974.86 --> 976.48]  And then somehow out of that comes life.
[976.48 --> 978.34]  If they're self-serving,
[978.78 --> 982.24]  they will end up in destructiveness.
[985.36 --> 986.66]  We see it all the time.
[988.34 --> 989.74]  Kind of what's at the heart of that?
[990.90 --> 992.46]  I think if we go back to Genesis,
[994.24 --> 997.68]  we have Eve standing by the tree
[997.68 --> 998.92]  with forbidden fruit.
[1000.56 --> 1001.66]  The serpent's there,
[1002.48 --> 1004.12]  and the serpent and Eve are talking,
[1004.12 --> 1005.12]  and Eve said,
[1005.18 --> 1007.10]  well, I can't do this because,
[1007.98 --> 1008.72]  you know, I'll die.
[1009.14 --> 1010.48]  And we read then here,
[1011.18 --> 1011.90]  the serpent said,
[1011.96 --> 1012.84]  you won't die.
[1014.30 --> 1015.82]  The serpent replied to the woman,
[1016.24 --> 1019.40]  God knows that your eyes will be opened
[1019.40 --> 1020.48]  as soon as you eat it,
[1020.62 --> 1023.54]  and you will be like God,
[1024.84 --> 1025.66]  knowing good and evil.
[1025.66 --> 1031.82]  When we attempt to merely please ourselves,
[1032.56 --> 1035.32]  we attempt to be God.
[1036.96 --> 1039.48]  I am the great decider.
[1042.70 --> 1044.32]  The irony is this.
[1045.70 --> 1048.90]  It leaves you with you as God,
[1049.00 --> 1050.88]  which means you have a pathetic,
[1051.58 --> 1053.06]  powerless God.
[1053.06 --> 1058.50]  Attempts at self-salvation
[1058.50 --> 1060.62]  always lead to shame
[1060.62 --> 1062.62]  and always lead to emptiness.
[1063.74 --> 1064.16]  Always.
[1065.40 --> 1067.44]  Adam and Eve had everything,
[1067.68 --> 1067.86]  right,
[1067.92 --> 1069.78]  but they perceived something was missing.
[1070.90 --> 1072.22]  And then took the goal
[1072.22 --> 1074.86]  to find satisfaction in their own hands,
[1075.12 --> 1077.10]  rather than embracing the creator's,
[1077.10 --> 1078.40]  and I chose these words very carefully,
[1078.78 --> 1081.52]  the creator's wonderful limits.
[1081.52 --> 1085.60]  The creator's wonderful limits.
[1085.76 --> 1087.10]  We do some weird things
[1087.10 --> 1088.60]  with the creator's limits, right?
[1088.66 --> 1089.44]  We get the sense,
[1089.50 --> 1089.98]  oh, the law,
[1090.12 --> 1091.42]  God's trying to box us in.
[1092.00 --> 1093.58]  And it's the exact opposite.
[1095.28 --> 1096.60]  It's the exact opposite.
[1096.80 --> 1098.68]  It's actually about life,
[1099.16 --> 1100.38]  and the creator knows life.
[1100.98 --> 1101.16]  You know,
[1101.20 --> 1102.18]  when we're out of touch
[1102.18 --> 1103.62]  with ourselves and our hearts,
[1103.88 --> 1104.96]  when we're out of touch
[1104.96 --> 1106.20]  with our true story,
[1106.20 --> 1107.56]  where a loving creator says,
[1107.92 --> 1108.66]  this is life,
[1109.00 --> 1109.76]  this isn't.
[1111.52 --> 1112.56]  Well,
[1112.62 --> 1114.12]  then we walk the earth
[1114.12 --> 1115.44]  using others,
[1116.40 --> 1117.56]  using things
[1117.56 --> 1119.12]  to attempt to satisfy
[1119.12 --> 1119.92]  a deep ache
[1119.92 --> 1121.18]  that comes when we walk
[1121.18 --> 1121.90]  outside the rhythms
[1121.90 --> 1122.78]  of our creator,
[1123.28 --> 1124.48]  instead of walking
[1124.48 --> 1125.40]  with the creator
[1125.40 --> 1126.96]  as we were intended to
[1126.96 --> 1127.88]  in the garden.
[1127.88 --> 1131.10]  And then,
[1131.24 --> 1131.84]  what happens?
[1132.16 --> 1132.28]  Well,
[1132.32 --> 1133.70]  then we leave behind
[1133.70 --> 1135.86]  a debris field
[1135.86 --> 1136.92]  of emptiness
[1136.92 --> 1138.54]  and shame
[1138.54 --> 1139.52]  and pain
[1139.52 --> 1140.90]  and broken relationships
[1140.90 --> 1142.18]  and shattered dreams
[1142.18 --> 1145.62]  because it doesn't lead to life.
[1145.76 --> 1147.10]  It doesn't work.
[1147.10 --> 1153.92]  In the absence
[1153.92 --> 1155.86]  of real connection,
[1156.30 --> 1157.08]  real intimacy,
[1157.68 --> 1158.20]  ahad,
[1158.68 --> 1158.92]  right,
[1159.22 --> 1159.74]  oneness
[1159.74 --> 1160.80]  with one another,
[1161.02 --> 1162.30]  we will then search
[1162.30 --> 1163.26]  for substitutes
[1163.26 --> 1165.32]  that cannot fulfill,
[1165.74 --> 1168.46]  that will leave us empty
[1168.46 --> 1173.30]  because nothing replaces God
[1173.30 --> 1175.06]  and His pathway to life.
[1175.06 --> 1176.46]  nothing.
[1179.20 --> 1180.70]  Intimacy is found
[1180.70 --> 1182.62]  in pleasing God.
[1185.34 --> 1186.42]  And the lie,
[1186.94 --> 1188.44]  it's found in getting
[1188.44 --> 1189.48]  what you want
[1189.48 --> 1190.30]  for you.
[1191.46 --> 1192.60]  Some kind of
[1192.60 --> 1193.54]  lust fulfillment
[1193.54 --> 1195.56]  or some lie
[1195.56 --> 1196.30]  you tell yourself.
[1197.94 --> 1199.14]  Our society
[1199.14 --> 1200.60]  strives to find
[1200.60 --> 1201.42]  meaning and purpose.
[1201.58 --> 1202.92]  I think all human beings
[1202.92 --> 1204.08]  attempt to do that.
[1204.08 --> 1206.26]  They try to find it
[1206.26 --> 1206.94]  in a variety of ways.
[1207.02 --> 1207.12]  Well,
[1207.20 --> 1208.24]  in having a good time.
[1208.66 --> 1209.48]  Nothing wrong
[1209.48 --> 1210.46]  with having a good time.
[1210.52 --> 1211.42]  So I'm not saying
[1211.42 --> 1211.84]  that's wrong.
[1212.12 --> 1212.74]  But if that's where
[1212.74 --> 1213.26]  you're going to find
[1213.26 --> 1213.74]  your meaning,
[1214.02 --> 1215.06]  you're going to come up short.
[1215.28 --> 1216.32]  Or it might be found
[1216.32 --> 1217.08]  in beauty.
[1217.38 --> 1218.12]  Nothing wrong
[1218.12 --> 1219.14]  with enjoying beauty,
[1219.26 --> 1219.78]  of course.
[1220.04 --> 1220.98]  But that's not
[1220.98 --> 1221.52]  where you're going to find
[1221.52 --> 1222.22]  your ultimate meaning,
[1222.34 --> 1223.08]  your ultimate significance.
[1223.64 --> 1224.50]  It can be found
[1224.50 --> 1226.66]  in living however you want.
[1226.72 --> 1227.62]  And you decide
[1227.62 --> 1228.38]  how it's all going to go
[1228.38 --> 1229.10]  and you might find it
[1229.10 --> 1229.58]  through drugs
[1229.58 --> 1230.12]  or alcohol
[1230.12 --> 1230.60]  or sex
[1230.60 --> 1231.20]  or great food
[1231.20 --> 1232.02]  or experiences.
[1232.02 --> 1235.02]  Again,
[1235.86 --> 1236.56]  none of those things
[1236.56 --> 1237.30]  in and of themselves
[1237.30 --> 1239.78]  is bad per se
[1239.78 --> 1240.56]  except
[1240.56 --> 1242.76]  they make horrible
[1242.76 --> 1243.88]  God substitutes
[1243.88 --> 1245.82]  because they are then
[1245.82 --> 1246.34]  just done
[1246.34 --> 1247.98]  to please almighty you
[1247.98 --> 1249.14]  instead of almighty God.
[1251.96 --> 1252.26]  Paul,
[1252.74 --> 1253.24]  his argument
[1253.24 --> 1254.60]  to all of this stuff
[1254.60 --> 1255.44]  is quite simple.
[1255.86 --> 1256.30]  You present,
[1256.44 --> 1256.52]  oh,
[1256.56 --> 1257.24]  this is how I want to live,
[1257.28 --> 1257.88]  this is what I want to do,
[1257.96 --> 1258.68]  yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[1259.08 --> 1259.60]  And Paul says,
[1259.64 --> 1259.94]  you know what?
[1259.94 --> 1261.18]  Here's my argument.
[1261.62 --> 1262.12]  Please God.
[1263.48 --> 1264.10]  There we go.
[1265.62 --> 1266.16]  I win.
[1267.82 --> 1268.12]  Right?
[1269.72 --> 1272.22]  And I can see
[1272.22 --> 1273.42]  a lot of people
[1273.42 --> 1273.66]  would say,
[1273.72 --> 1274.14]  well, come on,
[1274.16 --> 1274.34]  really?
[1275.18 --> 1275.48]  Really?
[1275.62 --> 1275.78]  Really?
[1276.16 --> 1277.32]  Why is that
[1277.32 --> 1278.06]  the only way it works?
[1278.86 --> 1280.08]  And let's explore
[1280.08 --> 1281.02]  that just a little bit here.
[1282.48 --> 1283.36]  I would ask,
[1283.72 --> 1285.50]  have all the other options
[1285.50 --> 1286.32]  worked?
[1286.32 --> 1289.78]  Have they brought you
[1289.78 --> 1290.84]  what you're really
[1290.84 --> 1292.34]  longing for?
[1295.44 --> 1296.62]  I've met with
[1296.62 --> 1298.16]  people after people
[1298.16 --> 1298.78]  after people
[1298.78 --> 1299.54]  who have tried
[1299.54 --> 1301.16]  God's substitutes
[1301.16 --> 1302.98]  and they always
[1302.98 --> 1304.32]  come out on the short end.
[1306.68 --> 1308.24]  It never satisfies.
[1310.26 --> 1311.20]  And like the great
[1311.20 --> 1312.60]  theologian Mick Jagger said,
[1312.92 --> 1313.66]  I can't find
[1313.66 --> 1315.18]  any satisfaction.
[1315.18 --> 1322.50]  what you're really
[1322.50 --> 1323.24]  longing for,
[1323.80 --> 1323.94]  you know,
[1323.98 --> 1325.12]  making happiness
[1325.12 --> 1326.68]  your highest goal.
[1327.32 --> 1328.92]  Has it brought you there?
[1328.92 --> 1333.42]  And then when you're
[1333.42 --> 1334.28]  not happy,
[1336.04 --> 1337.08]  what next?
[1339.74 --> 1341.34]  When you're depressed,
[1341.68 --> 1342.58]  when you're feeling
[1342.58 --> 1343.00]  empty,
[1343.12 --> 1343.56]  when you're feeling
[1343.56 --> 1344.14]  unfulfilled,
[1344.54 --> 1345.20]  now what?
[1345.38 --> 1346.46]  When a good day,
[1346.58 --> 1347.58]  a good day is only
[1347.58 --> 1348.38]  defined as the day
[1348.38 --> 1349.40]  where I got my wants
[1349.40 --> 1349.70]  met,
[1349.92 --> 1350.98]  then what do you do
[1350.98 --> 1351.90]  with a bad day?
[1351.90 --> 1358.60]  hear me well.
[1359.38 --> 1360.44]  Everything in life
[1360.44 --> 1361.08]  cannot,
[1361.26 --> 1362.26]  cannot be a tool
[1362.26 --> 1362.68]  or a way
[1362.68 --> 1363.54]  to make you happy
[1363.54 --> 1364.64]  as you define it.
[1367.08 --> 1368.22]  Because here's the problem,
[1368.36 --> 1369.26]  then right and wrong
[1369.26 --> 1370.44]  get replaced with
[1370.44 --> 1371.70]  how does that
[1371.70 --> 1372.86]  make me feel?
[1373.44 --> 1374.30]  And then we're back
[1374.30 --> 1375.54]  to that stupid statement,
[1375.76 --> 1376.90]  how can it be wrong
[1376.90 --> 1378.14]  when it feels so right?
[1378.14 --> 1379.32]  and we're hijacked
[1379.32 --> 1380.16]  by our feelings
[1380.16 --> 1380.82]  once again.
[1384.58 --> 1385.68]  The problem is this,
[1386.04 --> 1389.80]  you're not free
[1389.80 --> 1391.68]  in those moments
[1391.68 --> 1392.84]  then to pursue truth.
[1394.10 --> 1395.78]  You can only pursue
[1395.78 --> 1397.16]  what makes you happy
[1397.16 --> 1399.44]  as you define it.
[1401.36 --> 1402.72]  Paul deals with
[1402.72 --> 1403.74]  some of this argumentation
[1403.74 --> 1404.80]  in 1 Corinthians 6.
[1404.84 --> 1405.44]  Look at it with me.
[1406.66 --> 1407.64]  Paul starts off,
[1407.70 --> 1407.92]  he said,
[1408.14 --> 1408.40]  well,
[1408.58 --> 1409.34]  you say,
[1409.54 --> 1410.26]  I'm allowed
[1410.26 --> 1410.88]  to do anything.
[1412.32 --> 1412.62]  Okay?
[1414.42 --> 1414.74]  But,
[1414.92 --> 1415.30]  you know what,
[1415.38 --> 1415.64]  Paul said,
[1415.70 --> 1416.20]  not everything
[1416.20 --> 1416.94]  is good for you.
[1417.88 --> 1418.70]  And even though
[1418.70 --> 1419.32]  I'm allowed
[1419.32 --> 1420.00]  to do anything,
[1420.18 --> 1420.70]  Paul argues,
[1420.84 --> 1421.46]  I must not be
[1421.46 --> 1422.60]  a slave to anything
[1422.60 --> 1423.26]  because that's
[1423.26 --> 1423.86]  kind of how it goes.
[1424.26 --> 1424.68]  You say,
[1424.76 --> 1424.88]  well,
[1425.02 --> 1425.80]  food was made
[1425.80 --> 1426.32]  for their stomach,
[1426.44 --> 1427.00]  stomach for food,
[1427.06 --> 1427.18]  right,
[1427.20 --> 1427.88]  I can do whatever I want.
[1428.26 --> 1429.08]  And this is true though,
[1429.32 --> 1430.00]  Paul says,
[1430.06 --> 1430.62]  so someday God
[1430.62 --> 1431.04]  will do away
[1431.04 --> 1431.60]  both of them.
[1433.52 --> 1434.12]  This is not
[1434.12 --> 1435.26]  the long term story.
[1435.74 --> 1435.92]  But,
[1436.18 --> 1437.26]  you can't say,
[1437.34 --> 1437.66]  Paul said,
[1437.66 --> 1438.68]  that our bodies
[1438.68 --> 1439.10]  were made
[1439.10 --> 1440.14]  for sexual immorality.
[1441.10 --> 1442.06]  They were made
[1442.06 --> 1443.20]  for the Lord
[1443.20 --> 1444.16]  and the Lord
[1444.16 --> 1445.10]  cares about
[1445.10 --> 1446.20]  our bodies.
[1447.76 --> 1448.24]  And God
[1448.24 --> 1449.08]  will raise us
[1449.08 --> 1450.06]  from the dead
[1450.06 --> 1450.84]  by his power
[1450.84 --> 1451.38]  because you're
[1451.38 --> 1452.08]  going to die
[1452.08 --> 1453.54]  just as he raised
[1453.54 --> 1453.96]  our Lord
[1453.96 --> 1454.76]  from the dead.
[1455.56 --> 1456.02]  And Paul
[1456.02 --> 1456.58]  is messing
[1456.58 --> 1457.80]  with the definition
[1457.80 --> 1458.78]  and the idea
[1458.78 --> 1459.18]  of freedom.
[1459.68 --> 1460.98]  He throws this
[1460.98 --> 1461.44]  kind of
[1461.44 --> 1464.20]  contrary statement
[1464.20 --> 1464.56]  almost
[1464.56 --> 1465.70]  in front of them all.
[1465.70 --> 1465.90]  He says,
[1466.10 --> 1467.08]  you can be a slave
[1467.08 --> 1467.62]  to freedom.
[1468.84 --> 1469.14]  You know,
[1469.22 --> 1470.54]  what a weird mix,
[1470.62 --> 1470.78]  right?
[1471.16 --> 1472.10]  I'm a slave
[1472.10 --> 1472.74]  to freedom.
[1472.84 --> 1473.48]  I'm a slave
[1473.48 --> 1474.10]  to my wants.
[1474.16 --> 1474.70]  I'm a slave
[1474.70 --> 1475.64]  to all those
[1475.64 --> 1476.16]  kinds of things.
[1476.44 --> 1477.86]  I do whatever
[1477.86 --> 1478.52]  I want
[1478.52 --> 1479.12]  and pretty soon
[1479.12 --> 1479.68]  I'm a slave
[1479.68 --> 1480.42]  to my wants.
[1483.56 --> 1484.40]  And we see this
[1484.40 --> 1485.04]  all the time.
[1487.12 --> 1488.10]  And Paul says,
[1488.26 --> 1489.22]  try adding this word
[1489.22 --> 1490.34]  to your questions.
[1490.56 --> 1491.00]  Add the word
[1491.00 --> 1491.44]  should.
[1491.44 --> 1494.58]  should I do this?
[1496.16 --> 1496.92]  Not do I want
[1496.92 --> 1497.34]  to do this.
[1497.40 --> 1498.52]  Should I do this?
[1499.34 --> 1500.40]  Is this in line
[1500.40 --> 1501.38]  with God's design?
[1501.94 --> 1502.64]  Does this move
[1502.64 --> 1503.32]  toward life
[1503.32 --> 1504.32]  or away from it?
[1506.20 --> 1507.02]  And here's the irony.
[1508.08 --> 1508.46]  Those are
[1508.46 --> 1509.38]  those wonderful limits.
[1509.90 --> 1511.62]  God frees you
[1511.62 --> 1514.04]  to live life
[1514.04 --> 1516.08]  within his good will
[1516.08 --> 1517.00]  and his design.
[1518.40 --> 1518.84]  Now,
[1519.32 --> 1520.30]  let me add this.
[1520.30 --> 1521.90]  you can't do this
[1521.90 --> 1522.70]  in your own strength.
[1524.80 --> 1525.60]  You can't.
[1529.18 --> 1529.58]  Scripture
[1529.58 --> 1530.98]  and the gospel
[1530.98 --> 1532.64]  has a constant picture
[1532.64 --> 1533.18]  of a God
[1533.18 --> 1534.52]  who comes to us.
[1535.96 --> 1537.00]  Time and time again
[1537.00 --> 1538.40]  God shows up
[1538.40 --> 1540.28]  when we need him
[1540.28 --> 1541.24]  and we always need him
[1541.24 --> 1542.26]  but he shows up
[1542.26 --> 1543.12]  in significant ways.
[1543.78 --> 1544.54]  And we see this
[1544.54 --> 1545.36]  throughout the gospel.
[1546.48 --> 1547.18]  The incarnation,
[1547.64 --> 1547.76]  right?
[1548.34 --> 1549.38]  God sends Jesus
[1549.38 --> 1549.94]  into the world.
[1549.94 --> 1550.52]  We're going to celebrate
[1550.52 --> 1551.18]  that not too long
[1551.18 --> 1551.54]  from now.
[1552.84 --> 1554.84]  God sends the Holy Spirit
[1554.84 --> 1556.92]  because we need
[1556.92 --> 1557.82]  the power of the Holy Spirit
[1557.82 --> 1558.34]  in our lives.
[1559.08 --> 1560.10]  And I'm reading a book
[1560.10 --> 1561.42]  and in that book
[1561.42 --> 1562.32]  there's this quote
[1562.32 --> 1563.98]  about the incarnation.
[1564.14 --> 1564.82]  Let me read it to you.
[1565.30 --> 1566.28]  The incarnation,
[1566.76 --> 1567.56]  God coming to us,
[1568.32 --> 1569.84]  retunes our anxious
[1569.84 --> 1571.30]  and grasping souls,
[1572.12 --> 1572.84]  reminds us
[1572.84 --> 1574.14]  of our divine design,
[1574.40 --> 1575.64]  and reunites us
[1575.64 --> 1577.40]  with our divine center.
[1577.40 --> 1578.86]  Jesus,
[1579.52 --> 1580.46]  and the word
[1580.46 --> 1581.14]  self-centeredness
[1581.14 --> 1583.22]  is what sin is,
[1583.62 --> 1584.62]  Jesus is the living
[1584.62 --> 1585.10]  antidote
[1585.10 --> 1586.22]  to self-centeredness.
[1586.78 --> 1587.54]  He answers into
[1587.54 --> 1588.12]  the waters
[1588.12 --> 1589.06]  of self-centeredness,
[1589.16 --> 1590.14]  suffers in the waters
[1590.14 --> 1591.02]  of self-centeredness,
[1591.26 --> 1591.86]  is crucified
[1591.86 --> 1592.62]  in the waters
[1592.62 --> 1593.42]  of self-centeredness,
[1593.68 --> 1594.76]  and yet rises
[1594.76 --> 1595.56]  through the waters
[1595.56 --> 1596.56]  to redeem
[1596.56 --> 1597.74]  and restore
[1597.74 --> 1599.72]  the entire cosmos.
[1599.72 --> 1604.44]  It is in the power
[1604.44 --> 1605.26]  of His coming
[1605.26 --> 1605.88]  and His Spirit
[1605.88 --> 1606.86]  that we are able
[1606.86 --> 1607.98]  to please God.
[1608.76 --> 1609.48]  Through Jesus,
[1609.78 --> 1611.04]  we find favor
[1611.04 --> 1612.06]  with the Father,
[1613.14 --> 1614.54]  and His Spirit then
[1614.54 --> 1615.68]  empowers us
[1615.68 --> 1617.58]  to live the good limits
[1617.58 --> 1618.30]  in the way
[1618.30 --> 1619.68]  that He intends us to live.
[1620.06 --> 1620.20]  You know,
[1620.28 --> 1621.42]  and that's so much more
[1621.42 --> 1621.96]  than you simply
[1621.96 --> 1622.96]  trying harder,
[1623.22 --> 1624.18]  although God
[1624.18 --> 1625.20]  doesn't want you to try.
[1625.50 --> 1626.32]  But your efforts
[1626.32 --> 1627.52]  are not enough.
[1627.92 --> 1628.64]  You need power
[1628.64 --> 1629.50]  outside of you,
[1629.78 --> 1630.44]  because remember,
[1630.72 --> 1632.00]  you make a lousy God.
[1634.04 --> 1634.88]  And then another quote
[1634.88 --> 1635.74]  from that book
[1635.74 --> 1636.28]  that I'd read,
[1637.20 --> 1638.54]  the psychologist says,
[1638.98 --> 1639.68]  I've never seen
[1639.68 --> 1640.78]  real growth occur
[1640.78 --> 1642.76]  without suffering,
[1643.20 --> 1643.78]  humiliation,
[1644.40 --> 1644.94]  disappointment,
[1645.46 --> 1646.14]  and pain.
[1647.52 --> 1648.62]  Why is that?
[1649.82 --> 1651.40]  Because that's the way
[1651.40 --> 1653.02]  the self dies.
[1655.40 --> 1656.20]  That's the way
[1656.20 --> 1657.12]  the self dies.
[1657.12 --> 1658.60]  And then the author
[1658.60 --> 1659.06]  goes on.
[1659.36 --> 1660.48]  The way of transformation,
[1660.64 --> 1661.08]  and I could have
[1661.08 --> 1661.78]  replaced the word
[1661.78 --> 1662.58]  with some of the words
[1662.58 --> 1663.20]  that Paul uses,
[1663.52 --> 1664.26]  the way of transformation,
[1664.46 --> 1665.40]  the way of Christlikeness,
[1665.50 --> 1666.42]  the way of sanctification,
[1666.56 --> 1667.26]  the way of holiness,
[1667.58 --> 1668.60]  is the way
[1668.60 --> 1669.90]  of the cross.
[1672.12 --> 1672.36]  Yeah,
[1672.54 --> 1673.40]  where Christ died,
[1673.48 --> 1673.92]  but also
[1673.92 --> 1676.06]  where you died.
[1677.66 --> 1678.78]  A journey in which
[1678.78 --> 1679.56]  our suffering
[1679.56 --> 1680.52]  and repentance
[1680.52 --> 1681.78]  makes way
[1681.78 --> 1683.34]  for resurrection.
[1683.34 --> 1688.10]  we're going to have
[1688.10 --> 1688.50]  communion.
[1690.98 --> 1692.24]  And if you
[1692.24 --> 1693.18]  don't have
[1693.18 --> 1694.34]  communion items,
[1694.42 --> 1695.28]  they are on the table there.
[1695.32 --> 1696.14]  You can still grab some,
[1696.22 --> 1696.80]  but we're going to have
[1696.80 --> 1697.34]  communion now.
[1697.34 --> 1710.58]  As I said,
[1711.70 --> 1714.32]  Christ came to us
[1714.32 --> 1716.64]  in our brokenness
[1716.64 --> 1718.32]  in order to bring us
[1718.32 --> 1719.80]  a haad,
[1720.80 --> 1721.28]  oneness.
[1722.18 --> 1724.00]  Oneness with the Father,
[1724.88 --> 1726.14]  oneness with ourselves,
[1726.44 --> 1727.80]  oneness in our relationships,
[1728.46 --> 1729.60]  oneness in our living
[1729.60 --> 1730.66]  and the way we live.
[1731.82 --> 1732.28]  And that
[1732.28 --> 1733.52]  a haad,
[1733.82 --> 1735.12]  it comes through,
[1735.62 --> 1736.40]  first and foremost,
[1736.52 --> 1737.58]  the suffering and death
[1737.58 --> 1738.10]  of Jesus,
[1738.36 --> 1739.98]  the door to oneness
[1739.98 --> 1740.66]  and wholeness
[1740.66 --> 1741.16]  and restoration.
[1741.78 --> 1742.38]  And in that,
[1742.48 --> 1742.66]  then,
[1742.86 --> 1743.62]  we come
[1743.62 --> 1744.84]  with our surrender
[1744.84 --> 1746.02]  and our brokenness
[1746.02 --> 1746.84]  and our pain,
[1746.84 --> 1748.18]  and we receive
[1748.18 --> 1749.28]  that a haad,
[1749.50 --> 1750.34]  that oneness.
[1754.00 --> 1757.16]  You know,
[1757.28 --> 1759.16]  when we talk about
[1759.16 --> 1761.30]  oneness here,
[1761.44 --> 1761.86]  a haad,
[1762.30 --> 1763.24]  it's ironic
[1763.24 --> 1764.22]  that it happens
[1764.22 --> 1766.80]  through brokenness.
[1768.68 --> 1769.96]  What Christ says,
[1771.24 --> 1771.88]  my body,
[1772.72 --> 1773.94]  given to you,
[1775.30 --> 1776.52]  given to you.
[1777.30 --> 1778.52]  I don't know
[1778.52 --> 1780.08]  where you need haad
[1780.08 --> 1780.92]  and oneness
[1780.92 --> 1781.58]  in your life,
[1781.72 --> 1782.56]  but it comes
[1782.56 --> 1783.24]  through Jesus.
[1784.00 --> 1785.08]  The one who said,
[1785.68 --> 1788.20]  this is my body
[1788.20 --> 1789.40]  and I give it
[1789.40 --> 1790.02]  in service
[1790.02 --> 1790.80]  to the will
[1790.80 --> 1791.54]  and the mission
[1791.54 --> 1792.24]  of the Father
[1792.24 --> 1793.34]  whose desire
[1793.34 --> 1794.42]  is to have a haad
[1794.42 --> 1795.10]  and oneness
[1795.10 --> 1796.34]  in the world,
[1797.62 --> 1798.24]  including you,
[1798.96 --> 1799.78]  including your marriage,
[1800.12 --> 1800.96]  including your families,
[1801.88 --> 1803.08]  including every aspect
[1803.08 --> 1803.82]  of your life.
[1803.82 --> 1810.52]  and Jesus takes the cup
[1810.52 --> 1813.14]  and pours wine
[1813.14 --> 1816.56]  and he said,
[1816.80 --> 1817.76]  this is my blood
[1817.76 --> 1820.16]  shed and given for you
[1820.16 --> 1821.04]  so that you may be
[1821.04 --> 1822.78]  cleansed of all
[1822.78 --> 1824.16]  that is contrary
[1824.16 --> 1825.24]  to real life,
[1825.54 --> 1827.24]  with all that is contrary
[1827.24 --> 1828.02]  to a haad,
[1828.10 --> 1828.72]  to oneness.
[1829.02 --> 1830.78]  My blood brings you
[1830.78 --> 1831.48]  cleansing
[1831.48 --> 1832.68]  and it brings you
[1832.68 --> 1833.44]  oneness.
[1834.14 --> 1835.02]  People of God,
[1836.10 --> 1836.52]  eat,
[1837.26 --> 1837.66]  drink,
[1838.22 --> 1838.72]  remember,
[1838.94 --> 1839.68]  and believe
[1839.68 --> 1840.68]  that through Jesus
[1840.68 --> 1842.38]  you have resurrection
[1842.38 --> 1843.98]  and you have life
[1843.98 --> 1845.32]  and you have oneness.
[1845.32 --> 1873.10]  let us pray.
[1873.10 --> 1873.12]  Let us pray.
[1875.32 --> 1878.60]  Lord God,
[1879.80 --> 1882.20]  we are so grateful
[1882.20 --> 1884.24]  that you bring us life.
[1885.90 --> 1886.44]  Lord,
[1886.54 --> 1887.16]  forgive us
[1887.16 --> 1888.98]  in so many ways
[1888.98 --> 1889.92]  where we choose
[1889.92 --> 1891.02]  death
[1891.02 --> 1892.20]  instead of life,
[1892.30 --> 1893.14]  where we choose curse
[1893.14 --> 1894.18]  instead of blessing,
[1895.34 --> 1896.62]  where we choose darkness
[1896.62 --> 1897.44]  instead of light.
[1898.90 --> 1899.16]  Lord,
[1899.24 --> 1900.14]  thank you for coming
[1900.14 --> 1901.62]  and for dying
[1901.62 --> 1903.02]  so that we might know life.
[1903.02 --> 1905.46]  thank you for presenting us
[1905.46 --> 1906.94]  the way of life,
[1907.06 --> 1907.16]  Lord,
[1907.24 --> 1908.10]  that might we choose
[1908.10 --> 1908.94]  to live in it
[1908.94 --> 1910.42]  and thrive in it
[1910.42 --> 1911.54]  and struggle for it
[1911.54 --> 1912.12]  and then,
[1912.34 --> 1913.06]  like Paul says,
[1913.22 --> 1914.16]  more and more
[1914.16 --> 1915.42]  embrace what Christ
[1915.42 --> 1916.24]  has brought us.
[1917.14 --> 1917.38]  Lord,
[1917.44 --> 1918.02]  thank you
[1918.02 --> 1919.28]  that we can have
[1919.28 --> 1920.20]  the life in you
[1920.20 --> 1921.34]  and that we can know it
[1921.34 --> 1921.86]  more and more
[1921.86 --> 1922.78]  through the power
[1922.78 --> 1923.46]  of the Holy Spirit.
[1923.98 --> 1924.10]  Lord,
[1924.14 --> 1925.38]  I pray that everyone here
[1925.38 --> 1926.40]  will surrender
[1926.40 --> 1928.24]  what isn't life-giving
[1928.24 --> 1929.44]  and embrace
[1929.44 --> 1930.42]  what is life.
[1930.86 --> 1931.40]  We pray this
[1931.40 --> 1932.20]  in the name of the Father,
[1932.38 --> 1932.66]  the Son,
[1932.70 --> 1933.28]  and the Holy Spirit.
[1933.72 --> 1933.92]  Amen.
[1933.92 --> 1934.04]  Amen.
