[0.00 --> 8.10]  we'll miss you guys a lot
[8.10 --> 13.36]  I was Laura's teacher at one point
[13.36 --> 17.24]  and Dave keeps teasing me that I'm trying to take all the credit
[17.24 --> 19.10]  for all her success but that's not the case
[19.10 --> 22.30]  we're going to miss you a lot
[22.30 --> 27.10]  it's so good to see what God has done in your life
[27.10 --> 28.32]  and in our lives
[28.32 --> 35.26]  today we are concluding the visioning series
[35.26 --> 37.08]  belong, believe, become
[37.08 --> 41.72]  Pastor Dave preached on the belong, believe part
[41.72 --> 45.10]  belong, right, we belong to Christ, we belong to one another
[45.10 --> 49.46]  we want those who come to this church
[49.46 --> 52.76]  regardless where they are in their faith walk
[52.76 --> 54.06]  to feel like they belong
[54.06 --> 57.84]  right, so you belong, if you come here
[57.84 --> 59.32]  you belong
[59.32 --> 62.56]  and we want you to know that
[62.56 --> 66.82]  we also are a community that believes
[66.82 --> 68.76]  we are bound together by
[68.76 --> 71.22]  beliefs, beliefs in the gospel
[71.22 --> 73.16]  story and our place
[73.16 --> 73.56]  in it
[73.56 --> 77.10]  and we confess that and we attempt to
[77.10 --> 78.10]  live that out together
[78.10 --> 80.22]  and then this morning
[80.22 --> 81.64]  as has been said
[81.64 --> 82.84]  we're going to talk about becoming
[82.84 --> 84.44]  and
[84.44 --> 87.58]  it's a massively big topic
[87.58 --> 88.42]  all these are
[88.42 --> 90.58]  so to kind of do one sermon on it
[90.58 --> 92.82]  almost doesn't do it justice
[92.82 --> 94.00]  but I'll do the best I can
[94.00 --> 95.92]  I read this quote
[95.92 --> 96.44]  and it says
[96.44 --> 97.78]  Christians need
[97.78 --> 99.52]  to look like
[99.52 --> 101.30]  what they are talking about
[101.30 --> 104.12]  I've been thinking about that
[104.12 --> 104.44]  you know
[104.44 --> 105.70]  Christians need to look like
[105.70 --> 107.02]  what they are talking about
[107.02 --> 110.06]  it's not always the case
[110.06 --> 111.02]  right
[111.02 --> 111.30]  I mean
[111.30 --> 112.42]  as the saying goes
[112.42 --> 113.44]  talk is cheap
[113.44 --> 114.96]  authenticity
[114.96 --> 116.36]  is essential
[116.36 --> 117.46]  and that shows up
[117.46 --> 118.54]  in the way we live
[118.54 --> 120.64]  we are to become
[120.64 --> 121.88]  Christ-like
[121.88 --> 123.86]  we don't just say words
[123.86 --> 126.42]  think of
[126.42 --> 127.78]  metamorphosis
[127.78 --> 128.86]  right
[128.86 --> 129.58]  metamorphosis
[129.58 --> 130.96]  is the caterpillar
[130.96 --> 132.14]  becoming
[132.14 --> 133.24]  the butterfly
[133.24 --> 135.88]  an amazing transformation
[135.88 --> 137.70]  the word morpho
[137.70 --> 138.30]  is the word
[138.30 --> 139.70]  that means
[139.70 --> 140.82]  form
[140.82 --> 142.40]  it's your nature
[142.40 --> 143.70]  it refers to
[143.70 --> 144.28]  the essence
[144.28 --> 145.12]  of a person
[145.12 --> 146.56]  I mean
[146.56 --> 147.84]  Paul said of Jesus
[147.84 --> 149.10]  in Philippians 2
[149.10 --> 150.68]  he described Jesus
[150.68 --> 151.76]  and I have the
[151.76 --> 152.66]  verse up here
[152.66 --> 152.96]  it says
[152.96 --> 153.62]  who
[153.62 --> 154.30]  Jesus
[154.30 --> 155.46]  who though he was
[155.46 --> 157.02]  in form of God
[157.02 --> 158.86]  did not count equality
[158.86 --> 159.32]  with God
[159.32 --> 160.50]  something to be grasped
[160.50 --> 162.02]  in morpho
[162.02 --> 162.86]  of God
[162.86 --> 164.22]  in essence
[164.22 --> 165.56]  he is God
[165.56 --> 166.80]  his very nature
[166.80 --> 167.84]  is God
[167.84 --> 170.04]  the Greek prefix
[170.04 --> 170.80]  though that's added
[170.80 --> 171.24]  to that
[171.24 --> 172.54]  metamorphosis
[172.54 --> 173.02]  meta
[173.02 --> 174.60]  is to change
[174.60 --> 175.26]  the nature
[175.26 --> 176.00]  of something
[176.00 --> 176.74]  or someone
[176.74 --> 179.48]  this is an inside
[179.48 --> 180.16]  work
[180.16 --> 181.20]  that has huge
[181.20 --> 182.12]  implications
[182.12 --> 183.40]  on the
[183.40 --> 184.78]  outward living
[184.78 --> 187.40]  and I think
[187.40 --> 188.60]  of our human nature
[188.60 --> 189.54]  which is often
[189.54 --> 192.14]  described as sinful
[192.14 --> 193.58]  as broken
[193.58 --> 195.26]  and it needs
[195.26 --> 196.94]  metamorphosis
[196.94 --> 197.52]  and that's
[197.52 --> 198.30]  kind of what
[198.30 --> 199.38]  scripture talks about
[199.38 --> 201.42]  being born again
[201.42 --> 204.42]  it's taking on
[204.42 --> 205.44]  in Genesis
[205.44 --> 206.28]  it describes us
[206.28 --> 207.02]  as being in the image
[207.02 --> 207.44]  of God
[207.44 --> 208.26]  in a sense
[208.26 --> 209.58]  it's reclaiming
[209.58 --> 210.18]  the vision
[210.18 --> 211.12]  of God
[211.12 --> 212.40]  the image of God
[212.40 --> 213.38]  in our lives again
[213.38 --> 214.50]  his nature
[214.50 --> 215.64]  his form
[215.64 --> 216.92]  becomes ours
[216.92 --> 220.60]  in Christian
[220.60 --> 221.54]  theology
[221.54 --> 222.46]  we try to tackle
[222.46 --> 223.44]  this with words
[223.44 --> 224.66]  it's a bit of a
[224.66 --> 225.58]  daunting task
[225.58 --> 226.80]  and we use words
[226.80 --> 228.04]  like justification
[228.04 --> 229.80]  justified
[229.80 --> 231.16]  we are justified
[231.16 --> 232.20]  by Christ's work
[232.20 --> 232.86]  on the cross
[232.86 --> 234.50]  but then we add
[234.50 --> 235.34]  to it this word
[235.34 --> 236.64]  sanctification
[236.64 --> 238.58]  becoming more
[238.58 --> 239.30]  and more
[239.30 --> 239.92]  and more
[239.92 --> 240.70]  like Christ
[240.70 --> 241.60]  as we mature
[241.60 --> 242.52]  and those are
[242.52 --> 243.52]  pretty good words
[243.52 --> 244.06]  you know
[244.06 --> 244.98]  to try to capture
[244.98 --> 245.80]  something massive
[245.80 --> 247.30]  on the cross
[247.30 --> 248.06]  Christ
[248.06 --> 248.82]  atoned
[248.82 --> 250.06]  for our sins
[250.06 --> 251.46]  and he restored us
[251.46 --> 252.32]  in relationship
[252.32 --> 253.16]  with God
[253.16 --> 255.12]  now
[255.12 --> 257.12]  sometimes
[257.12 --> 257.86]  as Christians
[257.86 --> 259.06]  we stop there
[259.06 --> 259.86]  it's a wonderful
[259.86 --> 261.06]  wonderful moment
[261.06 --> 262.32]  to be atoned for
[262.32 --> 264.00]  but salvation
[264.00 --> 264.74]  is about
[264.74 --> 265.88]  deliverance
[265.88 --> 267.02]  deliverance
[267.02 --> 267.88]  from our sins
[267.88 --> 269.14]  but also from the sins
[269.14 --> 270.06]  of the world around us
[270.06 --> 271.08]  and then we are
[271.08 --> 272.40]  to be conformed
[272.40 --> 273.06]  into the image
[273.06 --> 273.62]  of Christ
[273.62 --> 274.94]  and involved
[274.94 --> 275.56]  in the renewal
[275.56 --> 276.32]  of all things
[276.32 --> 278.28]  let me go a little
[278.28 --> 278.92]  further with this
[278.92 --> 280.68]  great Christian thinker
[280.68 --> 281.46]  Dallas Willard
[281.46 --> 282.30]  says that humans
[282.30 --> 283.40]  are to respond
[283.40 --> 284.72]  to God's powerful
[284.72 --> 286.36]  spirit given grace
[286.36 --> 287.88]  and I love this
[287.88 --> 289.48]  by dethroning
[289.48 --> 290.32]  the self
[290.32 --> 291.94]  and enthroning
[291.94 --> 292.42]  God
[292.42 --> 295.16]  if you think
[295.16 --> 295.80]  of your life
[295.80 --> 296.62]  as in a life
[296.62 --> 297.58]  of dethroning
[297.58 --> 298.36]  the self
[298.36 --> 299.40]  and enthroning
[299.40 --> 299.78]  God
[299.78 --> 300.78]  thus allowing
[300.78 --> 301.94]  God to transform
[301.94 --> 303.28]  us over time
[303.28 --> 304.44]  into the likeness
[304.44 --> 305.00]  of his son
[305.00 --> 307.28]  and then
[307.28 --> 308.86]  Dallas Willard
[308.86 --> 309.24]  goes on
[309.24 --> 309.56]  he says
[309.56 --> 310.46]  and the church
[310.46 --> 310.82]  is
[310.82 --> 311.32]  and he says
[311.32 --> 312.40]  the hospital
[312.40 --> 313.08]  for those
[313.08 --> 313.46]  who are on
[313.46 --> 314.38]  this transformative
[314.38 --> 315.02]  journey
[315.02 --> 316.40]  right
[316.40 --> 317.32]  we're not
[317.32 --> 318.08]  the ones
[318.08 --> 318.72]  who have it
[318.72 --> 319.52]  all together
[319.52 --> 321.82]  we are collectively
[321.82 --> 323.02]  in the hospital
[323.02 --> 324.82]  of becoming
[324.82 --> 325.60]  like Christ
[325.60 --> 326.32]  Jesus kind of
[326.32 --> 327.02]  said it rather well
[327.02 --> 327.56]  when he spoke
[327.56 --> 329.02]  to some of the leaders
[329.02 --> 329.62]  in his time
[329.62 --> 330.26]  Mark 2
[330.26 --> 331.30]  verse 17
[331.30 --> 331.60]  he says
[331.60 --> 332.56]  on hearing this
[332.56 --> 333.56]  Jesus said to them
[333.56 --> 335.02]  it's not the healthy
[335.02 --> 335.96]  who need a doctor
[335.96 --> 337.08]  but the sick
[337.08 --> 338.72]  I have not come
[338.72 --> 339.54]  to call the righteous
[339.54 --> 340.26]  but the sinners
[340.26 --> 341.92]  and the irony
[341.92 --> 342.62]  was that
[342.62 --> 343.66]  scripture also says
[343.66 --> 344.36]  no one is righteous
[344.36 --> 345.66]  so he was indeed
[345.66 --> 346.66]  coming for everybody
[346.66 --> 348.92]  and we hold
[348.92 --> 350.10]  up together
[350.10 --> 350.94]  a vision
[350.94 --> 352.00]  of what life
[352.00 --> 352.78]  in the kingdom
[352.78 --> 353.92]  should look like
[353.92 --> 357.08]  and the intention
[357.08 --> 358.22]  we have together
[358.22 --> 359.20]  is to become
[359.20 --> 359.92]  like Christ
[359.92 --> 361.36]  and we encourage
[361.36 --> 361.94]  one another
[361.94 --> 362.60]  and yes
[362.60 --> 364.18]  hold one another
[364.18 --> 365.10]  accountable
[365.10 --> 366.34]  along that
[366.34 --> 367.00]  journey
[367.00 --> 369.64]  that's what we do
[369.64 --> 370.60]  collectively together
[370.60 --> 371.24]  in the hospital
[371.24 --> 371.56]  here
[371.56 --> 373.60]  we acknowledge
[373.60 --> 374.62]  that the human
[374.62 --> 375.38]  will has a
[375.38 --> 376.18]  has a role
[376.18 --> 376.78]  to play
[376.78 --> 377.84]  even though
[377.84 --> 379.08]  it by itself
[379.08 --> 379.82]  cannot achieve
[379.82 --> 380.82]  Christ likeness
[380.82 --> 384.52]  you gotta know
[384.52 --> 384.94]  this
[384.94 --> 385.84]  right
[385.84 --> 386.46]  that
[386.46 --> 387.56]  that
[387.56 --> 388.34]  it's not on
[388.34 --> 389.34]  our own strength
[389.34 --> 389.60]  right
[389.60 --> 390.08]  otherwise
[390.08 --> 391.94]  you know
[391.94 --> 392.70]  we fall into
[392.70 --> 393.82]  legalism very quickly
[393.82 --> 394.76]  and that's been a
[394.76 --> 395.36]  trap for
[395.36 --> 396.46]  for many a Christian
[396.46 --> 397.00]  unfortunately
[397.00 --> 398.30]  in an effort
[398.30 --> 399.52]  to mature
[399.52 --> 400.06]  right
[400.06 --> 400.84]  we are atoned
[400.84 --> 402.04]  for by Christ
[402.04 --> 402.34]  right
[402.34 --> 403.50]  justified by Christ
[403.50 --> 404.18]  and then the
[404.18 --> 405.26]  sanctification process
[405.26 --> 406.20]  kicks in
[406.20 --> 406.96]  where we are
[406.96 --> 407.60]  learning to become
[407.60 --> 408.02]  like Christ
[408.02 --> 409.14]  but in an effort
[409.14 --> 409.90]  to mature
[409.90 --> 411.04]  we can easily
[411.04 --> 411.66]  attempt
[411.66 --> 412.50]  to win
[412.50 --> 413.32]  God's favor
[413.32 --> 414.22]  as if our
[414.22 --> 414.86]  performance
[414.86 --> 415.54]  is what
[415.54 --> 416.92]  finally determines
[416.92 --> 417.72]  whether our
[417.72 --> 418.60]  relationship with
[418.60 --> 419.20]  God is good
[419.20 --> 419.62]  or bad
[419.62 --> 422.12]  and that's
[422.12 --> 422.56]  that's
[422.56 --> 423.36]  that's legalism
[423.36 --> 424.42]  it suddenly
[424.42 --> 425.06]  becomes
[425.06 --> 426.20]  all about us
[426.20 --> 427.66]  and what we do
[427.66 --> 429.24]  instead of being
[429.24 --> 429.94]  all about what
[429.94 --> 430.98]  Jesus has done
[430.98 --> 432.20]  in our lives
[432.20 --> 434.34]  and we cooperate
[434.34 --> 435.44]  with what he's done
[435.44 --> 438.20]  and then
[438.20 --> 438.98]  if we fall
[438.98 --> 439.66]  into that trap
[439.66 --> 440.36]  of legalism
[440.36 --> 441.74]  we then can live
[441.74 --> 442.58]  with a lot of rules
[442.58 --> 443.64]  and a lot of standards
[443.64 --> 445.44]  which ironically
[445.44 --> 446.06]  provide us
[446.06 --> 446.54]  with a way
[446.54 --> 448.58]  of avoiding
[448.58 --> 449.44]  to acknowledge
[449.44 --> 450.58]  our deepest needs
[450.58 --> 451.70]  our deepest deficiencies
[451.70 --> 452.84]  our deepest inabilities
[452.84 --> 454.10]  I think that's why
[454.10 --> 455.14]  Jesus went down
[455.14 --> 455.66]  the path
[455.66 --> 456.44]  of saying things
[456.44 --> 457.66]  like speck
[457.66 --> 458.36]  and log
[458.36 --> 459.70]  you know
[459.70 --> 460.48]  in legalism
[460.48 --> 461.50]  we can get so busy
[461.50 --> 463.26]  looking for specks
[463.26 --> 464.68]  in other people's eyes
[464.68 --> 465.78]  and we miss logs
[465.78 --> 466.92]  because we're really
[466.92 --> 467.90]  more into specks
[467.90 --> 469.70]  but your life
[469.70 --> 470.38]  might need some
[470.38 --> 471.30]  log removal
[471.30 --> 473.34]  but you're not
[473.34 --> 474.06]  going to go there
[474.06 --> 474.62]  because you've got
[474.62 --> 475.48]  lots of little rules
[475.48 --> 476.10]  that you keep
[476.10 --> 477.16]  that don't really tackle
[477.16 --> 478.04]  the deepest places
[478.04 --> 478.86]  you need to go
[478.86 --> 480.18]  and then we fall
[480.18 --> 480.74]  into the trap
[480.74 --> 481.44]  saying well look
[481.44 --> 482.20]  what I can do
[482.20 --> 483.38]  and we generate
[483.38 --> 484.24]  our own meaning
[484.24 --> 485.00]  and security
[485.00 --> 486.56]  it's what Christian writer
[486.56 --> 487.16]  Michael Horton
[487.16 --> 488.08]  describes as
[488.08 --> 488.64]  and I quote
[488.64 --> 490.32]  the default setting
[490.32 --> 491.38]  of the human heart
[491.38 --> 492.62]  is the religion
[492.62 --> 493.78]  of self salvation
[493.78 --> 496.14]  of self salvation
[496.14 --> 497.98]  there's something
[497.98 --> 498.60]  in us
[498.60 --> 499.48]  that wants to
[499.48 --> 500.38]  save ourselves
[500.38 --> 501.28]  and get the credit
[501.28 --> 503.42]  and this keeps us
[503.42 --> 504.32]  from the essential
[504.32 --> 504.72]  then
[504.72 --> 505.72]  of becoming
[505.72 --> 507.32]  like Christ
[507.32 --> 508.78]  which is really
[508.78 --> 509.86]  a demand
[509.86 --> 510.74]  for an act
[510.74 --> 511.54]  of surrender
[511.54 --> 514.12]  an act of surrender
[514.12 --> 515.68]  that includes
[515.68 --> 516.32]  obedience
[516.32 --> 518.50]  to Christ
[518.50 --> 521.52]  in Luke 9
[521.52 --> 522.18]  Luke says
[522.18 --> 523.28]  it this way
[523.28 --> 524.22]  he says
[524.22 --> 525.96]  quoting Jesus here
[525.96 --> 526.82]  then he said
[526.82 --> 527.42]  to them all
[527.42 --> 528.58]  whoever wants
[528.58 --> 529.72]  to be my disciple
[529.72 --> 531.36]  must deny themselves
[531.36 --> 532.92]  and take up their cross
[532.92 --> 533.38]  daily
[533.38 --> 534.22]  and follow me
[534.22 --> 538.22]  I read one writer
[538.22 --> 539.04]  who said
[539.04 --> 539.46]  the idea
[539.46 --> 540.24]  that you have to
[540.24 --> 540.92]  take the cross
[540.92 --> 541.44]  daily
[541.44 --> 542.82]  is that every day
[542.82 --> 543.72]  again you get
[543.72 --> 545.04]  to crucify your old self
[545.04 --> 547.36]  and its demands
[547.36 --> 547.78]  in your life
[547.78 --> 550.02]  he who is the way
[550.02 --> 551.04]  shows the way
[551.04 --> 551.66]  to live
[551.66 --> 553.56]  and he sends his spirit
[553.56 --> 554.54]  to empower us
[554.54 --> 556.86]  last week I made reference
[556.86 --> 557.32]  to the woman
[557.32 --> 558.04]  caught in adultery
[558.04 --> 558.94]  I think it's a story
[558.94 --> 559.56]  that resonates
[559.56 --> 561.16]  deeply with me
[561.16 --> 562.48]  and I think
[562.48 --> 563.38]  it illustrates
[563.38 --> 565.66]  these two things
[565.66 --> 566.48]  of justification
[566.48 --> 567.58]  and sanctification
[567.58 --> 569.44]  I just put a little bit
[569.44 --> 570.24]  of it in John 8
[570.24 --> 571.46]  the woman caught in adultery
[571.46 --> 572.16]  thrown in front of
[572.16 --> 573.22]  all these people
[573.22 --> 574.10]  and going to be stoned
[574.10 --> 574.58]  to death
[574.58 --> 575.10]  and Jesus said
[575.10 --> 575.86]  he was without sin
[575.86 --> 576.74]  throw the first stone
[576.74 --> 577.70]  and they all walk away
[577.70 --> 578.56]  and then we come
[578.56 --> 579.54]  to this passage here
[579.54 --> 580.74]  Jesus straightened up
[580.74 --> 581.22]  and asked her
[581.22 --> 582.14]  woman where are they
[582.14 --> 584.18]  has no one condemned you
[584.18 --> 585.72]  no one sir
[585.72 --> 586.26]  she said
[586.26 --> 587.04]  and then neither
[587.04 --> 588.06]  do I condemn you
[588.06 --> 589.26]  and then Jesus declared
[589.26 --> 589.76]  now go
[589.76 --> 590.92]  leave your life of sin
[590.92 --> 593.50]  she's guilty
[593.50 --> 595.68]  but because of Jesus
[595.68 --> 596.64]  and his work
[596.64 --> 597.40]  not condemned
[597.40 --> 599.54]  yet he says
[599.54 --> 600.52]  go sin no more
[600.52 --> 602.22]  and I think
[602.22 --> 603.18]  that's the beautiful
[603.18 --> 603.70]  thing here
[603.70 --> 604.38]  notice
[604.38 --> 606.30]  he's inviting her
[606.30 --> 607.62]  to live life
[607.62 --> 610.32]  to live life
[610.32 --> 611.12]  and not
[611.12 --> 612.30]  inviting her
[612.30 --> 612.86]  to try to score
[612.86 --> 613.72]  points with God
[613.72 --> 616.00]  sometimes I wonder
[616.00 --> 616.32]  you know
[616.32 --> 617.64]  go sin no more
[617.64 --> 618.02]  and then
[618.02 --> 618.76]  you could say
[618.76 --> 619.44]  well did she
[619.44 --> 621.80]  doesn't say
[621.80 --> 623.20]  I hope so
[623.20 --> 624.76]  I picture a story
[624.76 --> 625.22]  of a woman
[625.22 --> 627.04]  who goes back
[627.04 --> 627.70]  to her husband
[627.70 --> 629.50]  who restores marriage
[629.50 --> 630.90]  who builds life
[630.90 --> 631.24]  again
[631.24 --> 632.26]  the way God
[632.26 --> 632.86]  intends life
[632.86 --> 633.40]  to be lived
[633.40 --> 634.60]  we don't get to see
[634.60 --> 635.04]  that story
[635.04 --> 635.44]  but I hope
[635.44 --> 636.20]  that's how it went
[636.20 --> 639.16]  so what does it
[639.16 --> 639.84]  entail
[639.84 --> 641.82]  what does this entail
[641.82 --> 642.70]  to be Christ like
[642.70 --> 645.84]  how do we live out
[645.84 --> 646.50]  this act
[646.50 --> 647.32]  of sanctification
[647.32 --> 648.46]  that is an ongoing
[648.46 --> 649.74]  process of maturing
[649.74 --> 650.26]  in Christ
[650.26 --> 651.58]  for the rest of our lives
[651.58 --> 652.90]  what does that look like
[652.90 --> 653.88]  and I thought
[653.88 --> 654.90]  I'd just try to tackle
[654.90 --> 655.66]  this a little bit
[655.66 --> 656.82]  with Ephesians 4
[656.82 --> 657.48]  1-6
[657.48 --> 659.08]  so look at it with me
[659.08 --> 660.40]  Ephesians 4
[660.40 --> 661.10]  1-6
[661.10 --> 663.62]  it's up on the screen
[663.62 --> 665.22]  so you can read it as well
[665.22 --> 665.92]  Paul writes
[665.92 --> 666.94]  as a prisoner
[666.94 --> 668.36]  for the Lord
[668.36 --> 668.70]  then
[668.70 --> 670.08]  I urge you
[670.08 --> 671.06]  to live a life
[671.06 --> 672.08]  worthy
[672.08 --> 673.46]  of the calling
[673.46 --> 674.24]  you have received
[674.24 --> 675.74]  worthy of the calling
[675.74 --> 676.90]  that's a powerful line
[676.90 --> 678.28]  be completely
[678.28 --> 679.30]  humble and gentle
[679.30 --> 680.48]  be patient
[680.48 --> 681.96]  bearing with one another
[681.96 --> 682.46]  in love
[682.46 --> 683.64]  make every effort
[683.64 --> 684.60]  to keep the unity
[684.60 --> 686.06]  of the spirit
[686.06 --> 686.72]  through the bond
[686.72 --> 687.30]  of peace
[687.30 --> 689.00]  there is one body
[689.00 --> 689.68]  one spirit
[689.68 --> 690.88]  just as you were called
[690.88 --> 691.66]  to one hope
[691.66 --> 692.42]  when you were called
[692.42 --> 693.16]  one Lord
[693.16 --> 693.74]  one faith
[693.74 --> 694.40]  one baptism
[694.40 --> 695.88]  one God and Father of all
[695.88 --> 696.88]  who is over all
[696.88 --> 697.94]  and through all
[697.94 --> 699.30]  and in all
[699.30 --> 702.02]  a life
[702.02 --> 702.88]  worthy
[702.88 --> 704.22]  of the calling
[704.22 --> 705.82]  you have received
[705.82 --> 708.88]  that's a challenge
[708.88 --> 709.40]  isn't it
[709.40 --> 712.06]  the word worthy
[712.06 --> 712.36]  here
[712.36 --> 713.70]  in Paul's day
[713.70 --> 715.06]  referred to
[715.06 --> 715.84]  a counterweight
[715.84 --> 716.50]  a scale
[716.50 --> 716.88]  you know
[716.88 --> 717.62]  those scales
[717.62 --> 718.12]  where you can put
[718.12 --> 719.02]  something on this side
[719.02 --> 719.96]  and something on this side
[719.96 --> 721.08]  and then they can
[721.08 --> 722.76]  balance or not balance
[722.76 --> 724.90]  and Paul is saying here
[724.90 --> 725.54]  he says
[725.54 --> 726.22]  it's like
[726.22 --> 727.80]  take all that Jesus
[727.80 --> 728.88]  is for you
[728.88 --> 730.52]  and all that he has done
[730.52 --> 731.68]  and put it on one side
[731.68 --> 732.28]  of the scale
[732.28 --> 734.42]  and then you step
[734.42 --> 736.04]  on the other side
[736.04 --> 739.88]  and now live like that
[739.88 --> 743.52]  live that balance
[743.52 --> 744.12]  of life
[744.12 --> 745.50]  now a lot of you
[745.50 --> 745.74]  are going
[745.74 --> 748.54]  oh that's
[748.54 --> 750.30]  what I gotta do
[750.30 --> 751.04]  again
[751.04 --> 753.44]  not in your own strength
[753.44 --> 754.34]  but that's the picture
[754.34 --> 754.80]  Paul has
[754.80 --> 756.00]  walking worthy
[756.00 --> 757.02]  means there's balance
[757.02 --> 758.06]  that you are not
[758.06 --> 759.16]  achieving this on your own
[759.16 --> 759.74]  but somehow
[759.74 --> 761.06]  your lifestyle
[761.06 --> 762.62]  balances with
[762.62 --> 763.50]  his life
[763.50 --> 764.32]  in you
[764.32 --> 767.62]  my external living
[767.62 --> 769.52]  matches his ways
[769.52 --> 774.32]  and I think we all know
[774.32 --> 774.72]  when our lives
[774.72 --> 775.62]  get out of balance
[775.62 --> 778.80]  here's Jesus life
[778.80 --> 779.86]  and when I'm not living it
[779.86 --> 781.46]  it goes like this
[781.46 --> 781.94]  and the scale
[781.94 --> 782.82]  is out of whack
[782.82 --> 783.92]  we all know that
[783.92 --> 785.14]  and then repentance
[785.14 --> 785.76]  and so forth
[785.76 --> 788.08]  but the goal here
[788.08 --> 789.40]  this life worthy
[789.40 --> 791.04]  is I want nothing
[791.04 --> 793.22]  between my life
[793.22 --> 793.88]  and his
[793.88 --> 796.94]  I need that balance
[796.94 --> 800.46]  and so
[800.46 --> 801.24]  what does that life
[801.24 --> 801.82]  look like
[801.82 --> 803.20]  well
[803.20 --> 804.12]  Paul gives us
[804.12 --> 804.96]  four characteristics
[804.96 --> 807.12]  of Christ's likeness
[807.12 --> 808.10]  in Ephesians 4 here
[808.10 --> 810.26]  and it starts off
[810.26 --> 810.48]  with
[810.48 --> 812.02]  be completely humble
[812.02 --> 817.14]  I really feel
[817.14 --> 820.14]  in society today
[820.14 --> 822.94]  there's a tremendous
[822.94 --> 824.12]  lack of humility
[824.12 --> 826.80]  including the Christian
[826.80 --> 827.58]  community often
[827.58 --> 830.00]  try to think of Jesus
[830.00 --> 831.02]  without humility
[831.02 --> 835.18]  it frames his character
[835.18 --> 835.96]  from beginning to the end
[835.96 --> 836.18]  I mean
[836.18 --> 836.52]  you know
[836.52 --> 837.68]  he's born in a barn
[837.68 --> 840.06]  lived a poor life
[840.06 --> 840.58]  never held
[840.58 --> 842.08]  really public office
[842.08 --> 842.92]  never wrote a book
[842.92 --> 843.62]  you know
[843.62 --> 844.50]  washed feet
[844.50 --> 845.46]  like a slave
[845.46 --> 846.66]  and then submitted
[846.66 --> 847.56]  willingly
[847.56 --> 849.24]  to the humiliating death
[849.24 --> 850.92]  of crucifixion
[850.92 --> 853.62]  and he says
[853.62 --> 855.02]  in Matthew 18
[855.02 --> 855.66]  verse 4
[855.66 --> 856.54]  he says
[856.54 --> 857.00]  therefore
[857.00 --> 858.48]  whoever takes
[858.48 --> 859.82]  the lowly position
[859.82 --> 861.08]  of this child
[861.08 --> 862.50]  and he has a kid there
[862.50 --> 863.78]  is the greatest
[863.78 --> 864.46]  in the kingdom
[864.46 --> 864.98]  of heaven
[864.98 --> 867.14]  and he's done that
[867.14 --> 867.70]  a few times
[867.70 --> 868.52]  where he looks at kids
[868.52 --> 868.82]  and he says
[868.82 --> 869.50]  be like that
[869.50 --> 871.92]  because a child
[871.92 --> 873.50]  really has no power
[873.50 --> 875.02]  a child is not
[875.02 --> 875.98]  self-sufficient
[875.98 --> 877.16]  a child needs
[877.16 --> 878.36]  to trust his parents
[878.36 --> 879.70]  to supply his needs
[879.70 --> 881.86]  humility
[881.86 --> 882.62]  says
[882.62 --> 883.52]  Johnny Erickson
[883.52 --> 883.90]  Tata
[883.90 --> 885.32]  and I quote
[885.32 --> 886.86]  is just another word
[886.86 --> 887.16]  for
[887.16 --> 887.74]  and then scripture
[887.74 --> 888.20]  has a number
[888.20 --> 888.78]  of different words
[888.78 --> 889.90]  for little
[889.90 --> 891.08]  last
[891.08 --> 891.96]  lost
[891.96 --> 893.18]  least position
[893.18 --> 894.50]  we hold
[894.50 --> 895.38]  when gazing
[895.38 --> 896.10]  at Christ
[896.10 --> 897.76]  when I
[897.76 --> 898.68]  see Christ
[898.68 --> 899.28]  over here
[899.28 --> 900.08]  in my life
[900.08 --> 900.32]  here
[900.32 --> 900.84]  and I gaze
[900.84 --> 901.44]  at Christ
[901.44 --> 902.64]  I understand
[902.64 --> 904.08]  humility
[904.08 --> 906.32]  and then
[906.32 --> 906.66]  I long
[906.66 --> 907.76]  to be like Christ
[907.76 --> 911.68]  humility
[911.68 --> 912.50]  says
[912.50 --> 914.82]  I don't have
[914.82 --> 915.44]  to have things
[915.44 --> 916.04]  my way
[916.04 --> 918.88]  that decision
[918.88 --> 919.98]  that choice
[919.98 --> 920.94]  isn't the one
[920.94 --> 921.82]  I might make
[921.82 --> 922.84]  but that's okay
[922.84 --> 924.14]  that's not the main point
[924.14 --> 925.10]  what is good
[925.10 --> 925.76]  for others
[925.76 --> 928.34]  I don't know
[928.34 --> 929.04]  if you ever noticed this
[929.04 --> 929.88]  but we can fight
[929.88 --> 930.78]  about almost anything
[930.78 --> 932.82]  in churches
[932.82 --> 933.82]  and in society
[933.82 --> 936.06]  politics
[936.06 --> 938.20]  have you ever seen
[938.20 --> 939.12]  a time where it feels
[939.12 --> 939.92]  more divisive
[939.92 --> 941.24]  right
[941.24 --> 942.66]  music in the church
[942.66 --> 943.32]  historically
[943.32 --> 943.96]  has been a good
[943.96 --> 944.74]  fighting point
[944.74 --> 947.16]  what to eat
[947.16 --> 947.54]  you know
[947.54 --> 948.12]  when we're making
[948.12 --> 949.06]  little decisions
[949.06 --> 951.92]  COVID protocols
[951.92 --> 953.24]  let's not even
[953.24 --> 953.86]  go there
[953.86 --> 956.72]  the latest issue
[956.72 --> 957.46]  in church
[957.46 --> 958.38]  or in society
[958.38 --> 959.16]  and we can argue
[959.16 --> 959.70]  and fight about
[959.70 --> 960.78]  you name it
[960.78 --> 962.08]  we can fight
[962.08 --> 962.56]  about it
[962.56 --> 963.16]  because there's
[963.16 --> 963.96]  nothing
[963.96 --> 965.74]  more important
[965.74 --> 967.60]  than my opinion
[967.60 --> 973.56]  right
[973.56 --> 979.56]  you want to know
[979.56 --> 980.18]  how you can tell
[980.18 --> 980.84]  when humility
[980.84 --> 982.30]  takes hold on you
[982.30 --> 983.96]  it's when you have
[983.96 --> 984.80]  long periods
[984.80 --> 985.44]  of time
[985.44 --> 986.74]  without thinking
[986.74 --> 987.64]  about yourself
[987.64 --> 989.38]  and your amazing
[989.38 --> 989.98]  opinions
[989.98 --> 995.60]  if you are the
[995.60 --> 996.42]  center of your
[996.42 --> 996.92]  attention
[996.92 --> 997.76]  if you are driven
[997.76 --> 998.76]  by your wants
[998.76 --> 999.60]  or driven by your
[999.60 --> 1000.06]  opinions
[1000.06 --> 1000.96]  or your rights
[1000.96 --> 1001.80]  or your hurts
[1001.80 --> 1002.98]  well
[1002.98 --> 1004.52]  more metamorphosis
[1004.52 --> 1004.96]  needed
[1004.96 --> 1006.16]  you need to become
[1006.16 --> 1007.16]  more like
[1007.16 --> 1007.90]  Christ
[1007.90 --> 1011.74]  earlier I
[1011.74 --> 1012.72]  read a little bit
[1012.72 --> 1013.56]  out of Philippians 2
[1013.56 --> 1014.88]  but in Philippians 2
[1014.88 --> 1015.96]  Paul also says
[1015.96 --> 1016.36]  he says
[1016.36 --> 1016.80]  you know
[1016.80 --> 1017.60]  have the mind
[1017.60 --> 1018.26]  of Christ
[1018.26 --> 1019.78]  it says
[1019.78 --> 1020.52]  Christ
[1020.52 --> 1021.70]  emptied himself
[1021.70 --> 1022.66]  took the form
[1022.66 --> 1023.20]  of a servant
[1023.20 --> 1024.40]  you get the template
[1024.40 --> 1024.80]  there
[1024.80 --> 1026.18]  we need to
[1026.18 --> 1026.90]  empty
[1026.90 --> 1027.90]  ourselves
[1027.90 --> 1029.70]  self needs
[1029.70 --> 1030.22]  to die
[1030.22 --> 1030.90]  daily
[1030.90 --> 1034.56]  we are to be
[1034.56 --> 1035.46]  humble
[1035.46 --> 1036.60]  like Christ
[1036.60 --> 1037.00]  is humble
[1037.00 --> 1040.22]  and then Ephesians 2
[1040.22 --> 1040.90]  Paul goes on
[1040.90 --> 1041.12]  he says
[1041.12 --> 1041.60]  be completely
[1041.60 --> 1041.94]  humble
[1041.94 --> 1042.58]  and then he adds
[1042.58 --> 1043.10]  this word
[1043.10 --> 1044.20]  gentle
[1044.20 --> 1046.80]  sometimes the word
[1046.80 --> 1047.30]  gentle
[1047.30 --> 1048.34]  to me feels like
[1048.34 --> 1049.46]  when you have
[1049.46 --> 1050.60]  those Miss America
[1050.60 --> 1051.24]  or whatever
[1051.24 --> 1052.34]  contests
[1052.34 --> 1053.34]  and you get the
[1053.34 --> 1055.62]  congeniality award
[1055.62 --> 1056.88]  right
[1056.88 --> 1057.36]  oh wow
[1057.36 --> 1057.72]  you know
[1057.72 --> 1058.42]  she was the
[1058.42 --> 1059.06]  friendliest
[1059.06 --> 1059.64]  you know
[1059.64 --> 1060.36]  and it feels like
[1060.36 --> 1061.22]  it should be
[1061.22 --> 1062.00]  an amazing award
[1062.00 --> 1062.58]  but it always feels
[1062.58 --> 1063.44]  like it's not
[1063.44 --> 1064.90]  gentleness
[1064.90 --> 1066.04]  can somehow feel
[1066.04 --> 1067.04]  the work
[1067.04 --> 1067.70]  that often
[1067.70 --> 1068.14]  comes with
[1068.14 --> 1068.48]  gentleness
[1068.48 --> 1069.42]  is meekness
[1069.42 --> 1070.52]  you know
[1070.52 --> 1071.14]  and you wonder
[1071.14 --> 1071.54]  sometimes
[1071.54 --> 1072.26]  how many people
[1072.26 --> 1073.44]  long to be
[1073.44 --> 1073.96]  meek
[1073.96 --> 1076.72]  long to be
[1076.72 --> 1077.26]  gentle
[1077.26 --> 1079.88]  in Paul's day
[1079.88 --> 1080.54]  this word
[1080.54 --> 1081.26]  that was used
[1081.26 --> 1081.72]  for gentle
[1081.72 --> 1082.86]  was a word
[1082.86 --> 1083.32]  that was used
[1083.32 --> 1083.86]  to describe
[1083.86 --> 1084.28]  a horse
[1084.28 --> 1084.74]  that had been
[1084.74 --> 1085.22]  broken
[1085.22 --> 1089.60]  the horse
[1089.60 --> 1090.30]  still had
[1090.30 --> 1091.28]  lots of strength
[1091.28 --> 1093.46]  lots of spirit
[1093.46 --> 1094.52]  but it was
[1094.52 --> 1095.84]  under the control
[1095.84 --> 1096.72]  of another
[1096.72 --> 1097.84]  broken
[1097.84 --> 1098.54]  maybe a better
[1098.54 --> 1099.04]  word be
[1099.04 --> 1099.62]  kind of
[1099.62 --> 1100.80]  bent
[1100.80 --> 1102.66]  right
[1102.66 --> 1106.42]  I remember
[1106.42 --> 1107.50]  a number of years
[1107.50 --> 1107.72]  ago
[1107.72 --> 1108.30]  so this idea
[1108.30 --> 1108.80]  of broken
[1108.80 --> 1110.36]  and quite a number
[1110.36 --> 1110.84]  of years ago
[1110.84 --> 1111.90]  I was going
[1111.90 --> 1112.38]  through a dark
[1112.38 --> 1113.28]  time in my life
[1113.28 --> 1115.20]  wrestling with a lot
[1115.20 --> 1115.80]  of issues
[1115.80 --> 1117.36]  that were not
[1117.36 --> 1120.88]  dealt with in my life
[1120.88 --> 1121.00]  yet
[1121.00 --> 1121.74]  needed to be dealt
[1121.74 --> 1122.02]  with
[1122.02 --> 1123.72]  and my wife
[1123.72 --> 1124.46]  looked me in the eyes
[1124.46 --> 1124.96]  and she said
[1124.96 --> 1125.68]  you know what you need
[1125.68 --> 1126.00]  and I said
[1126.00 --> 1126.92]  what do I need
[1126.92 --> 1127.96]  you need to be broken
[1127.96 --> 1131.38]  what
[1131.38 --> 1133.78]  you need to understand
[1133.78 --> 1134.70]  what it is to be broken
[1134.70 --> 1138.52]  and then it happened
[1138.52 --> 1141.14]  and it was awful
[1141.14 --> 1143.44]  and it took
[1143.44 --> 1144.58]  counseling for about
[1144.58 --> 1145.42]  a year and a half
[1145.42 --> 1148.78]  and it broke me
[1148.78 --> 1152.62]  it broke deep
[1152.62 --> 1153.56]  deep down inside
[1153.56 --> 1154.26]  but it was the best
[1154.26 --> 1154.70]  thing that ever
[1154.70 --> 1155.10]  happened
[1155.10 --> 1157.40]  and my wife's
[1157.40 --> 1158.18]  prophetic words
[1158.18 --> 1160.28]  led to
[1160.28 --> 1161.58]  an amazing release
[1161.58 --> 1162.28]  of something
[1162.28 --> 1162.78]  in my life
[1162.78 --> 1163.12]  that needed
[1163.12 --> 1163.82]  to be released
[1163.82 --> 1166.56]  gentleness
[1166.56 --> 1168.50]  power
[1168.50 --> 1170.06]  under control
[1170.06 --> 1172.66]  you see it
[1172.66 --> 1173.18]  in those
[1173.18 --> 1174.28]  who don't insist
[1174.28 --> 1175.60]  on their own rights
[1175.60 --> 1176.84]  you see it
[1176.84 --> 1177.28]  in those
[1177.28 --> 1177.96]  who are not
[1177.96 --> 1179.10]  easily offended
[1179.10 --> 1180.94]  not argumentative
[1180.94 --> 1182.08]  who don't
[1182.08 --> 1183.30]  hold grudges
[1183.30 --> 1187.50]  if you're always
[1187.50 --> 1189.68]  defending yourself
[1189.68 --> 1190.54]  always picking
[1190.54 --> 1191.12]  a fight
[1191.12 --> 1193.42]  you need
[1193.42 --> 1194.58]  the spirit's work
[1194.58 --> 1196.26]  maybe you too
[1196.26 --> 1197.10]  need to be broken
[1197.10 --> 1198.70]  and you need to
[1198.70 --> 1199.24]  understand
[1199.24 --> 1200.48]  the gift
[1200.48 --> 1201.20]  of gentleness
[1201.20 --> 1202.90]  you see this
[1202.90 --> 1203.70]  in Jesus
[1203.70 --> 1204.00]  right
[1204.00 --> 1204.94]  he had all
[1204.94 --> 1205.66]  this strength
[1205.66 --> 1205.94]  I mean
[1205.94 --> 1206.66]  scripture says
[1206.66 --> 1207.08]  he could have
[1207.08 --> 1207.90]  called legions
[1207.90 --> 1208.54]  of angels
[1208.54 --> 1211.30]  to stop
[1211.30 --> 1211.98]  the whole process
[1211.98 --> 1212.58]  of crucifixion
[1212.58 --> 1213.26]  but he didn't do that
[1213.26 --> 1214.16]  he had nothing
[1214.16 --> 1214.78]  to prove
[1214.78 --> 1215.80]  except to live out
[1215.80 --> 1216.88]  his trust
[1216.88 --> 1217.48]  of the father
[1217.48 --> 1217.96]  and the mission
[1217.96 --> 1218.52]  of the father
[1218.52 --> 1222.12]  in James 3
[1222.12 --> 1223.18]  we read this
[1223.18 --> 1224.12]  I took it out
[1224.12 --> 1224.64]  of the voice
[1224.64 --> 1225.64]  it says
[1225.64 --> 1226.62]  and it's kind of
[1226.62 --> 1227.34]  good advice
[1227.34 --> 1228.76]  who in your community
[1228.76 --> 1229.46]  is understanding
[1229.46 --> 1229.92]  and wise
[1229.92 --> 1230.28]  okay
[1230.28 --> 1231.24]  find somebody like that
[1231.24 --> 1232.16]  who in your community
[1232.16 --> 1232.72]  is understanding
[1232.72 --> 1233.14]  and wise
[1233.14 --> 1234.36]  let his or her
[1234.36 --> 1234.88]  example
[1234.88 --> 1236.00]  which is marked
[1236.00 --> 1237.16]  by wisdom
[1237.16 --> 1238.02]  and gentleness
[1238.02 --> 1238.70]  blaze a trail
[1238.70 --> 1239.06]  for others
[1239.06 --> 1239.68]  and I think
[1239.68 --> 1240.16]  it's a beautiful
[1240.16 --> 1240.78]  combination
[1240.78 --> 1241.64]  wisdom
[1241.64 --> 1243.14]  and gentleness
[1243.14 --> 1244.90]  they go hand
[1244.90 --> 1245.60]  in hand
[1245.60 --> 1248.42]  too often
[1248.42 --> 1250.30]  our world
[1250.30 --> 1250.86]  celebrates
[1250.86 --> 1251.74]  the loud
[1251.74 --> 1252.88]  and the brash
[1252.88 --> 1257.36]  not much
[1257.36 --> 1258.68]  about the wise
[1258.68 --> 1259.44]  and the gentle
[1259.44 --> 1262.46]  so often
[1262.46 --> 1263.32]  we long
[1263.32 --> 1264.04]  to show others
[1264.04 --> 1264.72]  what we know
[1264.72 --> 1267.12]  right
[1267.12 --> 1267.86]  there's a debate
[1267.86 --> 1268.76]  you long to throw
[1268.76 --> 1269.86]  your two bits in
[1269.86 --> 1270.72]  show everybody
[1270.72 --> 1271.38]  what really
[1271.38 --> 1272.08]  ought to happen
[1272.08 --> 1272.92]  you're about
[1272.92 --> 1273.78]  putting people
[1273.78 --> 1274.52]  in their place
[1274.52 --> 1276.30]  these are indications
[1276.30 --> 1277.20]  that you need
[1277.20 --> 1278.54]  the continued growth
[1278.54 --> 1279.38]  and the brokenness
[1279.38 --> 1279.92]  that comes
[1279.92 --> 1281.24]  in becoming
[1281.24 --> 1282.70]  like Christ
[1282.70 --> 1286.66]  and Paul goes on
[1286.66 --> 1287.52]  in Ephesians 4
[1287.52 --> 1288.52]  he goes on
[1288.52 --> 1289.84]  we talk about humility
[1289.84 --> 1290.86]  we talk about gentleness
[1290.86 --> 1291.24]  and he says
[1291.24 --> 1292.06]  now be patient
[1292.06 --> 1293.88]  literally the word
[1293.88 --> 1295.52]  means long tempered
[1295.52 --> 1296.52]  long fused
[1296.52 --> 1299.22]  how do you respond
[1299.22 --> 1300.50]  to frustrations
[1300.50 --> 1301.72]  and inconveniences
[1301.72 --> 1302.46]  and delays
[1302.46 --> 1303.82]  and aggravating people
[1303.82 --> 1305.40]  and maddening circumstances
[1305.40 --> 1307.96]  do you wait
[1307.96 --> 1309.08]  to respond
[1309.08 --> 1310.44]  knowing anger
[1310.44 --> 1311.22]  and harsh replies
[1311.22 --> 1311.70]  are only going
[1311.70 --> 1312.38]  to make it worse
[1312.38 --> 1313.92]  do you trust
[1313.92 --> 1314.50]  that God
[1314.50 --> 1315.14]  is in control
[1315.14 --> 1316.40]  even in that
[1316.40 --> 1317.22]  circumstance
[1317.22 --> 1318.00]  that you're not
[1318.00 --> 1319.22]  particularly happy about
[1319.22 --> 1322.08]  going back to the book
[1322.08 --> 1322.78]  of James again
[1322.78 --> 1323.62]  James 1 19
[1323.62 --> 1324.60]  he writes
[1324.60 --> 1325.58]  my dear brothers
[1325.58 --> 1326.10]  and sisters
[1326.10 --> 1327.06]  take note of this
[1327.06 --> 1328.04]  everyone should be
[1328.04 --> 1328.62]  quick to listen
[1328.62 --> 1329.28]  slow to speak
[1329.28 --> 1330.34]  and slow to become angry
[1330.34 --> 1332.58]  yeah
[1332.58 --> 1334.22]  Jesus endured
[1334.22 --> 1334.96]  the cross
[1334.96 --> 1335.78]  the shame
[1335.78 --> 1336.56]  the hostility
[1336.56 --> 1337.68]  the false accusations
[1337.68 --> 1339.78]  as disciples of Jesus
[1339.78 --> 1340.86]  we must learn
[1340.86 --> 1341.84]  to be like Christ
[1341.84 --> 1342.90]  and that means
[1342.90 --> 1343.94]  we are patient
[1343.94 --> 1347.18]  and then Ephesians 4
[1347.18 --> 1347.82]  goes on
[1347.82 --> 1349.34]  with humility
[1349.34 --> 1350.04]  and gentleness
[1350.04 --> 1350.62]  and patience
[1350.62 --> 1351.16]  then he says
[1351.16 --> 1351.88]  and accept
[1351.88 --> 1352.66]  one another
[1352.66 --> 1353.92]  bear with one another
[1353.92 --> 1354.88]  in love
[1354.88 --> 1356.78]  I kind of like
[1356.78 --> 1357.64]  the word bear
[1357.64 --> 1358.80]  because
[1358.80 --> 1360.36]  it literally means
[1360.36 --> 1361.98]  putting up with people
[1361.98 --> 1364.98]  it would be a weird thing
[1364.98 --> 1365.88]  to say to your spouse
[1365.88 --> 1366.84]  or someone you love
[1366.84 --> 1368.04]  say I love you
[1368.04 --> 1369.26]  by putting up with you
[1369.26 --> 1372.28]  somehow
[1372.28 --> 1374.74]  displaying love
[1374.74 --> 1375.82]  even though
[1375.82 --> 1376.98]  I may not like
[1376.98 --> 1377.66]  that person
[1377.66 --> 1378.76]  in a given moment
[1378.76 --> 1381.38]  it may shock you
[1381.38 --> 1382.46]  but Jesus didn't like
[1382.46 --> 1383.40]  everyone all the time
[1383.40 --> 1385.60]  I was reading
[1385.60 --> 1386.38]  Luke 9
[1386.38 --> 1387.72]  when he's a little
[1387.72 --> 1389.00]  frustrated with a group
[1389.00 --> 1389.62]  and he says
[1389.62 --> 1390.68]  you unbelieving
[1390.68 --> 1391.72]  and perverse generation
[1391.72 --> 1392.38]  Jesus replied
[1392.38 --> 1393.40]  how long shall I
[1393.40 --> 1393.92]  stay with you
[1393.92 --> 1394.96]  and put up with you
[1394.96 --> 1398.54]  there's some
[1398.54 --> 1399.56]  pastoral words
[1399.56 --> 1401.92]  imagine I'm standing up here
[1401.92 --> 1402.38]  how long
[1402.38 --> 1402.70]  am I going to
[1402.70 --> 1404.00]  put up with you people
[1404.00 --> 1404.80]  right
[1404.80 --> 1407.44]  I know you have to
[1407.44 --> 1408.00]  put up with me
[1408.00 --> 1409.04]  so we're even
[1409.04 --> 1409.72]  on that score
[1409.72 --> 1412.80]  but the whole context
[1412.80 --> 1414.62]  is somehow that
[1414.62 --> 1415.82]  I need to love
[1415.82 --> 1417.26]  even when it's hard
[1417.26 --> 1419.32]  bearing with one another
[1419.32 --> 1420.88]  bearing with one another
[1420.88 --> 1421.34]  in love
[1421.34 --> 1422.74]  enduring differences
[1422.74 --> 1423.74]  and quirks
[1423.74 --> 1424.46]  and habits
[1424.46 --> 1425.76]  it means
[1425.76 --> 1427.40]  knowing you too
[1427.40 --> 1428.96]  are put up with
[1428.96 --> 1434.12]  we all have grumpy days
[1434.12 --> 1435.24]  and critical moments
[1435.24 --> 1436.56]  and granted
[1436.56 --> 1437.72]  some seem to have that
[1437.72 --> 1438.40]  a little more than others
[1438.40 --> 1438.96]  but you know
[1438.96 --> 1439.34]  Paul
[1439.34 --> 1440.04]  when he writes
[1440.04 --> 1440.78]  that amazing chapter
[1440.78 --> 1441.14]  on love
[1441.14 --> 1441.82]  in 1 Corinthians
[1441.82 --> 1442.40]  he says
[1442.40 --> 1442.90]  love
[1442.90 --> 1443.98]  and then he goes
[1443.98 --> 1446.64]  love always protects
[1446.64 --> 1448.18]  talk about enduring love
[1448.18 --> 1449.12]  always
[1449.12 --> 1449.96]  always
[1449.96 --> 1451.96]  trust
[1451.96 --> 1453.08]  always persevere
[1453.08 --> 1455.04]  love never fails
[1455.04 --> 1459.20]  that's
[1459.20 --> 1459.52]  that's a Christ
[1459.52 --> 1460.08]  like love
[1460.08 --> 1462.04]  that's
[1462.04 --> 1462.74]  what it is
[1462.74 --> 1463.42]  to reflect
[1463.42 --> 1463.92]  Jesus
[1463.92 --> 1465.22]  humility
[1465.22 --> 1466.30]  gentleness
[1466.30 --> 1466.98]  patience
[1466.98 --> 1468.38]  bearing with one another
[1468.38 --> 1468.78]  in love
[1468.78 --> 1469.54]  and notice
[1469.54 --> 1470.20]  all of these
[1470.20 --> 1470.66]  are about
[1470.66 --> 1471.40]  relationships
[1471.40 --> 1472.64]  you can't be
[1472.64 --> 1472.94]  humble
[1472.94 --> 1473.44]  and gentle
[1473.44 --> 1473.94]  and patient
[1473.94 --> 1474.34]  and showing
[1474.34 --> 1474.86]  forbearance
[1474.86 --> 1475.68]  without relating
[1475.68 --> 1476.20]  to people
[1476.20 --> 1479.74]  and then Paul
[1479.74 --> 1480.14]  goes on
[1480.14 --> 1480.70]  in Ephesians
[1480.70 --> 1481.50]  4
[1481.50 --> 1482.26]  let me read
[1482.26 --> 1482.88]  it to you
[1482.88 --> 1483.06]  again
[1483.06 --> 1484.10]  out of verse 3
[1484.10 --> 1484.32]  here
[1484.32 --> 1485.80]  make every effort
[1485.80 --> 1486.26]  so here
[1486.26 --> 1487.84]  we got this
[1487.84 --> 1488.76]  humility
[1488.76 --> 1489.36]  gentleness
[1489.36 --> 1490.64]  patience
[1490.64 --> 1491.14]  and love
[1491.14 --> 1491.68]  and then now
[1491.68 --> 1492.76]  make every effort
[1492.76 --> 1494.04]  to keep the unity
[1494.04 --> 1494.62]  of the spirit
[1494.62 --> 1495.16]  through the bond
[1495.16 --> 1495.66]  of peace
[1495.66 --> 1497.12]  there's one body
[1497.12 --> 1497.74]  one spirit
[1497.74 --> 1498.62]  just as you were called
[1498.62 --> 1499.24]  to one hope
[1499.24 --> 1500.20]  when you were called
[1500.20 --> 1500.68]  one Lord
[1500.68 --> 1501.18]  one faith
[1501.18 --> 1501.78]  one baptism
[1501.78 --> 1502.50]  one God
[1502.50 --> 1503.10]  and Father of all
[1503.10 --> 1503.88]  who is over all
[1503.88 --> 1504.36]  and through all
[1504.36 --> 1504.84]  and in all
[1504.84 --> 1507.58]  and the whole context
[1507.58 --> 1508.50]  is about being
[1508.50 --> 1509.68]  people of God
[1509.68 --> 1511.32]  there is unity
[1511.32 --> 1512.68]  in the spirit
[1512.68 --> 1514.68]  peace
[1514.68 --> 1514.70]  peace
[1514.70 --> 1516.34]  binds us
[1516.34 --> 1520.10]  and this is not
[1520.10 --> 1520.96]  about agreeing
[1520.96 --> 1522.40]  on every issue
[1522.40 --> 1525.10]  you know
[1525.10 --> 1525.44]  sometimes
[1525.44 --> 1526.78]  I listen to people
[1526.78 --> 1527.78]  talk about church
[1527.78 --> 1528.86]  and then there's
[1528.86 --> 1529.92]  issues in churches
[1529.92 --> 1530.86]  and they say
[1530.86 --> 1531.20]  oh man
[1531.20 --> 1532.26]  I probably should find
[1532.26 --> 1532.86]  you know
[1532.86 --> 1533.78]  find another church
[1533.78 --> 1535.04]  as if you're
[1535.04 --> 1536.44]  gonna find a church
[1536.44 --> 1537.38]  that if you need
[1537.38 --> 1537.82]  a church
[1537.82 --> 1538.86]  that agrees with you
[1538.86 --> 1539.62]  on every issue
[1539.62 --> 1540.64]  you're not looking
[1540.64 --> 1541.22]  for a church
[1541.22 --> 1541.60]  you're looking
[1541.60 --> 1542.28]  for a cult
[1542.28 --> 1547.50]  there's nothing
[1547.50 --> 1548.50]  better for you
[1548.50 --> 1549.12]  than to be
[1549.12 --> 1549.82]  in a place
[1549.82 --> 1551.06]  where you don't
[1551.06 --> 1551.86]  have everybody
[1551.86 --> 1552.92]  agreeing with you
[1552.92 --> 1555.28]  where
[1555.28 --> 1557.16]  if you need
[1557.16 --> 1557.92]  that total agreement
[1557.92 --> 1558.80]  if your opinion
[1558.80 --> 1559.60]  always has to be
[1559.60 --> 1559.94]  right
[1559.94 --> 1560.90]  well that's
[1560.90 --> 1561.86]  not a healthy thing
[1561.86 --> 1563.86]  you need some
[1563.86 --> 1564.86]  more metamorphosis
[1564.86 --> 1566.52]  truth is
[1566.52 --> 1566.86]  you know
[1566.86 --> 1568.72]  I need a church
[1568.72 --> 1569.24]  where people
[1569.24 --> 1570.22]  challenge me
[1570.22 --> 1572.14]  on certain things
[1572.14 --> 1573.02]  where I also
[1573.02 --> 1573.72]  have to relate
[1573.72 --> 1574.30]  with people
[1574.30 --> 1576.14]  this is gonna
[1576.14 --> 1576.86]  be shocking
[1576.86 --> 1578.34]  but my wife
[1578.34 --> 1578.80]  doesn't always
[1578.80 --> 1579.78]  agree with me
[1579.78 --> 1583.40]  and I don't
[1583.40 --> 1584.20]  get it
[1584.20 --> 1584.94]  right
[1584.94 --> 1585.46]  but no
[1585.46 --> 1586.72]  I do get it
[1586.72 --> 1588.20]  because that's
[1588.20 --> 1589.00]  that's the world
[1589.00 --> 1589.60]  we live in
[1589.60 --> 1590.84]  that's the way
[1590.84 --> 1592.00]  it needs to be
[1592.00 --> 1593.34]  and I need
[1593.34 --> 1593.92]  to learn
[1593.92 --> 1594.68]  and she needs
[1594.68 --> 1595.18]  to learn
[1595.18 --> 1595.94]  to love
[1595.94 --> 1596.44]  and relate
[1596.44 --> 1597.04]  with someone
[1597.04 --> 1597.64]  who they don't
[1597.64 --> 1598.54]  always agree with
[1598.54 --> 1601.48]  make every effort
[1601.48 --> 1603.28]  to grow
[1603.28 --> 1604.44]  and become like Christ
[1604.44 --> 1606.04]  it's a community project
[1606.04 --> 1607.86]  this is a greenhouse
[1607.86 --> 1608.80]  where we grow together
[1608.80 --> 1610.46]  where the spirit unifies
[1610.46 --> 1611.64]  where the oneness
[1611.64 --> 1612.66]  is in Christ
[1612.66 --> 1615.04]  and each of us
[1615.04 --> 1616.02]  takes it on ourselves
[1616.02 --> 1617.18]  to work toward
[1617.18 --> 1617.88]  that oneness
[1617.88 --> 1619.34]  that we find in Christ
[1619.34 --> 1620.26]  each of us
[1620.26 --> 1621.64]  making an effort
[1621.64 --> 1623.62]  that effort
[1623.62 --> 1624.54]  involves the humility
[1624.54 --> 1625.16]  and the gentleness
[1625.16 --> 1625.74]  and the patience
[1625.74 --> 1626.54]  and the forbearance
[1626.54 --> 1629.24]  we become like Christ
[1629.24 --> 1631.08]  also then
[1631.08 --> 1632.40]  when we get to this
[1632.40 --> 1633.50]  the sense of
[1633.50 --> 1634.52]  Christ likeness
[1634.52 --> 1635.56]  and Laura talked
[1635.56 --> 1635.96]  about that
[1635.96 --> 1636.64]  that we are
[1636.64 --> 1637.28]  ascent people
[1637.28 --> 1638.06]  we step into
[1638.06 --> 1638.80]  Christ mission
[1638.80 --> 1639.76]  as well
[1639.76 --> 1643.18]  ascent people
[1643.18 --> 1646.02]  sent to Calgary
[1646.02 --> 1648.44]  I don't like that
[1648.44 --> 1648.94]  very much
[1648.94 --> 1649.40]  but it's
[1649.40 --> 1650.30]  the way it is
[1650.30 --> 1652.42]  I like that
[1652.42 --> 1653.30]  she was sent here
[1653.30 --> 1654.48]  but I get it
[1654.48 --> 1655.54]  God sends people
[1655.54 --> 1656.32]  wherever he calls
[1656.32 --> 1656.88]  them to be
[1656.88 --> 1659.64]  I read this quote
[1659.64 --> 1661.56]  from Archbishop
[1661.56 --> 1662.64]  Michael Ramsey
[1662.64 --> 1664.42]  and he said it
[1664.42 --> 1665.12]  a number of years ago
[1665.12 --> 1667.24]  and he was talking
[1667.24 --> 1667.82]  about how
[1667.82 --> 1670.24]  Christ entered
[1670.24 --> 1671.86]  our world
[1671.86 --> 1673.98]  and that's a beautiful image
[1673.98 --> 1675.28]  and we are called
[1675.28 --> 1676.22]  to do the same
[1676.22 --> 1678.02]  and he writes
[1678.02 --> 1679.68]  we state
[1679.68 --> 1680.50]  and commend
[1680.50 --> 1681.72]  the faith
[1681.72 --> 1682.74]  only in so far
[1682.74 --> 1683.96]  as we go out
[1683.96 --> 1685.28]  and put ourselves
[1685.28 --> 1687.06]  with loving sympathy
[1687.06 --> 1688.66]  inside the doubts
[1688.66 --> 1689.30]  of the doubter
[1689.30 --> 1690.34]  the question
[1690.34 --> 1691.14]  of the questioner
[1691.14 --> 1692.04]  and the loneliness
[1692.04 --> 1692.90]  of those who have
[1692.90 --> 1693.88]  lost their way
[1693.88 --> 1702.96]  the danger here
[1702.96 --> 1703.14]  is
[1703.14 --> 1705.34]  for some
[1705.34 --> 1705.74]  is that
[1705.74 --> 1708.30]  we might want to then
[1708.30 --> 1709.18]  turn this into
[1709.18 --> 1709.90]  perfectionism
[1709.90 --> 1713.00]  and that's not
[1713.00 --> 1713.80]  what's being said here
[1713.80 --> 1718.10]  there's going to be times
[1718.10 --> 1718.94]  I think all of us
[1718.94 --> 1719.62]  know this right
[1719.62 --> 1720.40]  if you know yourself
[1720.40 --> 1722.06]  maybe we harden
[1722.06 --> 1722.54]  our hearts
[1722.54 --> 1723.46]  and we turn away
[1723.46 --> 1724.46]  from Christ's likeness
[1724.46 --> 1725.94]  but then
[1725.94 --> 1727.44]  then the spirit comes
[1727.44 --> 1728.96]  and God's patience
[1728.96 --> 1730.08]  and his gentleness
[1730.08 --> 1731.22]  and his forbearance
[1731.22 --> 1732.34]  and his humility
[1732.34 --> 1733.40]  and his love
[1733.40 --> 1735.28]  overcome me yet again
[1735.28 --> 1736.56]  and then I repent
[1736.56 --> 1737.20]  yet again
[1737.20 --> 1738.36]  and scripture uses
[1738.36 --> 1738.80]  the phrase
[1738.80 --> 1739.36]  he says
[1739.36 --> 1741.74]  you are born again
[1741.74 --> 1745.84]  you know
[1745.84 --> 1746.96]  we may argue
[1746.96 --> 1747.70]  and debate
[1747.70 --> 1748.66]  and question
[1748.66 --> 1749.78]  but God
[1749.78 --> 1750.56]  through its spirit
[1750.56 --> 1751.80]  convicts us
[1751.80 --> 1752.88]  and molds us
[1752.88 --> 1753.92]  and forms us
[1753.92 --> 1755.12]  into the likeness
[1755.12 --> 1755.78]  of his son
[1755.78 --> 1757.54]  and we need
[1757.54 --> 1758.40]  to surrender
[1758.40 --> 1760.02]  our will
[1760.02 --> 1760.72]  to his
[1760.72 --> 1762.38]  daily
[1762.38 --> 1764.78]  maybe hour
[1764.78 --> 1765.26]  by hour
[1765.26 --> 1765.86]  maybe minute
[1765.86 --> 1766.40]  by minute
[1766.40 --> 1769.20]  and this
[1769.20 --> 1770.20]  this shaping
[1770.20 --> 1771.12]  and this molding
[1771.12 --> 1772.20]  this Christ likeness
[1772.20 --> 1772.38]  is
[1772.38 --> 1773.18]  of the
[1773.18 --> 1774.28]  is done
[1774.28 --> 1775.40]  the work of the spirit
[1775.40 --> 1776.80]  and it is enhanced
[1776.80 --> 1777.64]  in our being
[1777.64 --> 1778.24]  together
[1778.24 --> 1779.64]  to hear God's
[1779.64 --> 1780.76]  God's word
[1780.76 --> 1781.74]  to worship
[1781.74 --> 1782.78]  to confess
[1782.78 --> 1784.48]  to celebrate communion
[1784.48 --> 1786.70]  it's enhanced
[1786.70 --> 1787.60]  through prayer
[1787.60 --> 1788.76]  through solitude
[1788.76 --> 1789.70]  through fasting
[1789.70 --> 1790.90]  through the need
[1790.90 --> 1792.62]  to take God's word
[1792.62 --> 1793.78]  and meditate on it
[1793.78 --> 1794.52]  and we begin
[1794.52 --> 1795.24]  to understand
[1795.24 --> 1795.72]  and we begin
[1795.72 --> 1796.08]  to grow
[1796.08 --> 1796.48]  what it is
[1796.48 --> 1797.30]  to be like Christ
[1797.30 --> 1798.44]  through our practices
[1798.44 --> 1800.04]  and through our holy habits
[1800.04 --> 1804.82]  but we've got to be careful
[1804.82 --> 1806.18]  because we so easily
[1806.18 --> 1807.42]  take those holy habits
[1807.42 --> 1809.14]  and we act like
[1809.14 --> 1809.70]  they're a way
[1809.70 --> 1810.40]  to make God
[1810.40 --> 1811.30]  like us better
[1811.30 --> 1812.36]  and somehow
[1812.36 --> 1813.98]  we miss the point
[1813.98 --> 1814.86]  no this is still
[1814.86 --> 1815.54]  about grace
[1815.54 --> 1816.86]  and these holy habits
[1816.86 --> 1817.66]  are there
[1817.66 --> 1818.42]  to help us
[1818.42 --> 1819.46]  become like Christ
[1819.46 --> 1820.92]  but it is through Christ
[1820.92 --> 1822.26]  that we have
[1822.26 --> 1823.26]  been saved
[1823.26 --> 1828.48]  we are striving
[1828.48 --> 1829.26]  to be brought
[1829.26 --> 1831.24]  into a harmony
[1831.24 --> 1832.78]  into harmony
[1832.78 --> 1833.24]  with working
[1833.24 --> 1833.84]  with the spirit
[1833.84 --> 1836.88]  and in our own strength
[1836.88 --> 1837.38]  it's clearly
[1837.38 --> 1838.60]  unattainable
[1838.60 --> 1839.08]  to become more
[1839.08 --> 1839.64]  like Christ
[1839.64 --> 1842.00]  and so we
[1842.00 --> 1843.46]  we
[1843.46 --> 1844.58]  individually
[1844.58 --> 1845.30]  and collectively
[1845.30 --> 1846.82]  we align ourselves
[1846.82 --> 1847.34]  with the work
[1847.34 --> 1847.82]  of the spirit
[1847.82 --> 1850.16]  and then the spirit
[1850.16 --> 1850.78]  enables us
[1850.78 --> 1851.30]  to continue
[1851.30 --> 1851.74]  to grow
[1851.74 --> 1853.26]  to become
[1853.26 --> 1854.10]  more like Christ
[1854.10 --> 1856.60]  one more quote
[1856.60 --> 1856.98]  from a guy
[1856.98 --> 1858.04]  named William Temple
[1858.04 --> 1860.66]  I kind of like
[1860.66 --> 1861.28]  how he said this
[1861.28 --> 1863.26]  he said
[1863.26 --> 1863.90]  it's no good
[1863.90 --> 1864.64]  giving me
[1864.64 --> 1865.96]  a play
[1865.96 --> 1866.84]  like Hamlet
[1866.84 --> 1867.78]  or King Lear
[1867.78 --> 1868.94]  and then telling me
[1868.94 --> 1869.58]  to write a play
[1869.58 --> 1870.26]  like that
[1870.26 --> 1871.30]  Shakespeare
[1871.30 --> 1872.16]  could do it
[1872.16 --> 1873.20]  I can't
[1873.20 --> 1874.90]  and it's no good
[1874.90 --> 1875.62]  showing me
[1875.62 --> 1876.04]  a life
[1876.04 --> 1876.72]  like the life
[1876.72 --> 1877.14]  of Jesus
[1877.14 --> 1877.94]  and telling me
[1877.94 --> 1879.18]  to live like that
[1879.18 --> 1880.60]  Jesus could do it
[1880.60 --> 1882.04]  I can't
[1882.04 --> 1884.12]  but if the genius
[1884.12 --> 1884.96]  of Shakespeare
[1884.96 --> 1885.68]  could come
[1885.68 --> 1887.12]  and live in me
[1887.12 --> 1888.64]  well then I could
[1888.64 --> 1889.52]  write plays like him
[1889.52 --> 1891.52]  and if the spirit
[1891.52 --> 1892.06]  comes
[1892.06 --> 1893.46]  into me
[1893.46 --> 1895.58]  well then I can live
[1895.58 --> 1896.96]  like Jesus
[1896.96 --> 1900.62]  that's good news
[1900.62 --> 1903.40]  people of hope
[1903.40 --> 1905.82]  you're not condemned
[1905.82 --> 1908.16]  celebrate that
[1908.16 --> 1910.04]  but remember
[1910.04 --> 1911.76]  go sin no more
[1911.76 --> 1913.66]  cooperate
[1913.66 --> 1914.68]  with the spirit
[1914.68 --> 1916.80]  and live in the way
[1916.80 --> 1917.86]  and in the mission
[1917.86 --> 1919.06]  of Jesus
[1919.06 --> 1920.82]  let's pray
[1920.82 --> 1925.06]  Lord God
[1925.06 --> 1925.98]  we come before you
[1925.98 --> 1926.74]  and we thank you
[1926.74 --> 1928.80]  for your amazing
[1928.80 --> 1929.70]  love for us
[1929.70 --> 1931.94]  thank you
[1931.94 --> 1932.30]  that you
[1932.30 --> 1933.20]  bring us
[1933.20 --> 1935.00]  your spirit
[1935.00 --> 1935.88]  so that we can
[1935.88 --> 1936.80]  live like Jesus
[1936.80 --> 1937.84]  Lord may we learn
[1937.84 --> 1938.34]  what it is
[1938.34 --> 1939.06]  to surrender
[1939.06 --> 1940.20]  may we learn
[1940.20 --> 1940.68]  what it is
[1940.68 --> 1941.48]  to be humble
[1941.48 --> 1943.12]  and gentle
[1943.12 --> 1945.08]  and patient
[1945.08 --> 1946.96]  may we learn
[1946.96 --> 1947.40]  what it is
[1947.40 --> 1948.00]  to love
[1948.00 --> 1949.58]  even when it's hard
[1949.58 --> 1951.38]  oh Lord
[1951.38 --> 1951.84]  help us
[1951.84 --> 1952.94]  to enter into
[1952.94 --> 1953.72]  the lives
[1953.72 --> 1954.22]  of others
[1954.22 --> 1955.18]  like you did
[1955.18 --> 1957.00]  trusting in the power
[1957.00 --> 1957.56]  of the spirit
[1957.56 --> 1958.22]  to lead us
[1958.22 --> 1958.98]  and to guide us
[1958.98 --> 1961.06]  may this church
[1961.06 --> 1961.88]  be a place
[1961.88 --> 1963.22]  that reflects
[1963.22 --> 1964.40]  not unity
[1964.40 --> 1965.46]  on every issue
[1965.46 --> 1966.38]  but unity
[1966.38 --> 1967.16]  in the spirit
[1967.16 --> 1968.32]  and a oneness
[1968.32 --> 1968.78]  in you
[1968.78 --> 1969.70]  in Jesus
[1969.70 --> 1970.16]  holy name
[1970.16 --> 1970.64]  we pray
[1970.64 --> 1971.82]  amen
[1971.82 --> 1977.20]  let's stand
[1977.20 --> 1981.86]  receive
[1982.36 --> 1983.70]  now
[1983.82 --> 1985.20]  in
[1985.20 --> 1986.12]  high
[1986.12 --> 1986.24]  amen
[1986.24 --> 1986.42]  in
