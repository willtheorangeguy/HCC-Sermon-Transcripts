[0.00 --> 2.90]  Good morning.
[6.42 --> 8.58]  I'm hoping this is a good message.
[9.10 --> 9.58]  So that's good.
[12.38 --> 14.08]  It's good to be with you all.
[14.28 --> 17.98]  As has been said already, it's a joy to gather.
[18.90 --> 24.40]  And we say those words, but we should never take it for granted.
[25.04 --> 27.42]  And so I'm so grateful we can be here together.
[27.42 --> 32.58]  We're continuing a series on Paul's letter to the Thessalonians.
[33.62 --> 37.28]  Paul has reminded them of his ongoing mission to proclaim the gospel.
[38.08 --> 40.54]  He has urged them to lead a life worthy of God.
[40.92 --> 43.42]  He offers thanksgiving for the Thessalonians.
[44.10 --> 45.34]  He wishes he could be with them.
[45.44 --> 49.54]  He challenges them to live a life to please God and let that be their only goal.
[50.10 --> 53.38]  And this should show up in how they live, including their sexuality.
[53.48 --> 54.94]  And I talked about that last week.
[54.94 --> 58.12]  And we continue now in 1 Thessalonians 4.
[58.42 --> 60.28]  I did the first part of 1 Thessalonians 4.
[60.36 --> 62.42]  Now we jump to verses 13 through 18.
[62.76 --> 64.26]  So let's take a look at it together.
[65.52 --> 66.52]  Where Paul writes,
[66.64 --> 67.50]  Brothers and sisters,
[68.50 --> 72.92]  we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death,
[73.68 --> 78.10]  so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind who have no hope.
[78.10 --> 81.94]  For we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
[82.72 --> 87.82]  and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
[88.86 --> 90.40]  According to the Lord's word,
[90.58 --> 93.26]  we tell you that we who are still alive,
[93.38 --> 95.24]  who are left until the coming of the Lord,
[95.48 --> 98.06]  will certainly not perceive those who have fallen asleep.
[98.84 --> 102.54]  For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command,
[102.92 --> 104.40]  with the voice of the archangels,
[104.40 --> 106.12]  and with the trumpet call of God,
[106.32 --> 108.62]  and the dead in Christ will rise first.
[109.66 --> 110.26]  After that,
[110.40 --> 112.14]  we who are still alive and are left
[112.14 --> 114.40]  will be caught up together with them in the clouds
[114.98 --> 116.50]  to meet the Lord in the air.
[116.64 --> 118.76]  And so we will be with the Lord forever.
[119.92 --> 120.32]  Therefore,
[120.88 --> 122.18]  encourage one another
[122.18 --> 124.44]  with these words.
[126.96 --> 128.64]  Paul is dealing
[128.64 --> 130.74]  with an important question
[130.74 --> 133.52]  that the Thessalonians are wrestling with.
[134.82 --> 136.46]  They're having some questions
[136.46 --> 138.80]  and some anxiety around loved ones
[138.80 --> 139.66]  that have died.
[140.86 --> 142.18]  Maybe some of them died
[142.18 --> 144.56]  even with the persecution that's going on.
[146.24 --> 147.66]  And they were expecting
[147.66 --> 149.22]  that the Lord would return
[149.22 --> 151.00]  any time soon.
[151.22 --> 151.50]  In fact,
[151.56 --> 152.42]  they expected that.
[153.34 --> 154.66]  And then here's the question.
[154.78 --> 155.82]  So how would that affect
[155.82 --> 157.12]  the loved ones
[157.12 --> 158.30]  who had died?
[158.30 --> 161.30]  Will those who are alive
[161.30 --> 162.74]  have some kind of advantage
[162.74 --> 164.38]  over those who died?
[165.88 --> 166.88]  They might have wrestled with,
[166.96 --> 167.10]  you know,
[167.14 --> 169.12]  maybe they weren't supposed to have died
[169.12 --> 170.32]  and there's something about
[170.32 --> 171.24]  having enough faith
[171.24 --> 171.70]  or whatever.
[172.30 --> 172.54]  You know,
[172.58 --> 173.84]  and I think as a pastor,
[173.96 --> 175.20]  I've met with people
[175.20 --> 177.40]  who are in their last days
[177.40 --> 178.30]  and, you know,
[178.38 --> 179.88]  some people die
[179.88 --> 181.60]  with a great deal of confidence,
[181.76 --> 182.54]  but I've had others
[182.54 --> 185.66]  who have been on their deathbeds
[185.66 --> 187.06]  and they've wrestled with,
[187.06 --> 188.54]  gee, was my faith enough?
[189.30 --> 190.26]  Am I good enough?
[191.04 --> 192.36]  And they wrestle with questions
[192.36 --> 193.38]  like that.
[193.76 --> 195.22]  Struggling here
[195.22 --> 196.68]  is the question of struggling
[196.68 --> 199.12]  with faith and death issues.
[200.22 --> 202.56]  And I think we all can relate with that.
[202.78 --> 204.10]  How do I deal
[204.10 --> 205.60]  with the inevitability of death?
[205.98 --> 207.34]  What's going to happen?
[209.40 --> 210.78]  What's going to happen then?
[210.78 --> 213.22]  This passage,
[213.48 --> 214.36]  I should point out,
[214.40 --> 215.50]  is often hijacked
[215.50 --> 216.28]  in a sense
[216.28 --> 217.44]  to talk about the details
[217.44 --> 218.38]  of the end of time.
[219.74 --> 221.58]  Something churches have argued about
[221.58 --> 223.00]  for a long time.
[223.88 --> 225.12]  And we get fancy words
[225.12 --> 226.24]  like premillennialism
[226.24 --> 227.44]  and postmillennialism
[227.44 --> 229.16]  and amillennialism
[229.16 --> 230.74]  and dispensationalism
[230.74 --> 232.70]  and all these big words
[232.70 --> 234.12]  and all arguing about
[234.12 --> 235.06]  Christ's return
[235.06 --> 236.26]  and the thousand-year reign
[236.26 --> 237.34]  and how that's all going to go.
[237.34 --> 237.50]  So,
[238.14 --> 240.38]  there's a verse here
[240.38 --> 241.60]  that kind of
[241.60 --> 243.44]  is used to talk about
[243.44 --> 244.00]  the rapture,
[244.08 --> 244.58]  for example,
[244.60 --> 245.60]  where we get caught up
[245.60 --> 246.36]  in the clouds.
[247.18 --> 247.32]  Right?
[247.36 --> 248.68]  And you have this picture
[248.68 --> 251.68]  of believers being taken up
[251.68 --> 253.08]  prior to the thousand-year reign
[253.08 --> 254.66]  and somebody's driving a car
[254.66 --> 255.86]  and suddenly the driver's gone
[255.86 --> 256.80]  or a plane
[256.80 --> 257.98]  and the pilot's gone.
[258.32 --> 259.10]  All kinds of things.
[260.34 --> 261.38]  I'm going to talk about that
[261.38 --> 261.76]  a little bit.
[261.80 --> 262.32]  I'm not going to get
[262.32 --> 263.26]  too caught up in that.
[263.26 --> 264.30]  But here,
[265.12 --> 268.28]  the ancient church,
[268.40 --> 269.24]  Father Jerome,
[270.56 --> 271.90]  in the translation
[271.90 --> 273.64]  of Scripture into Latin
[273.64 --> 274.98]  used this word repair,
[275.16 --> 276.84]  R-A-P-E-R-E.
[277.14 --> 278.42]  We get the word rapture
[278.42 --> 278.94]  out of that.
[280.38 --> 282.48]  For most of Christian history
[282.48 --> 283.88]  until 1820,
[284.32 --> 285.24]  there wasn't too much
[285.24 --> 286.80]  of a problem with the word.
[287.28 --> 288.56]  It wasn't understood
[288.56 --> 290.48]  like we think of it now.
[290.48 --> 293.58]  But at that time in 1820
[293.58 --> 294.16]  in Scotland,
[294.30 --> 295.10]  there was a teenage girl.
[295.18 --> 295.70]  She had a vision
[295.70 --> 297.92]  of this idea of rapture
[297.92 --> 298.90]  that we hold now.
[299.26 --> 300.48]  And a pastor there
[300.48 --> 301.20]  heard that
[301.20 --> 302.40]  and he saw it as a revelation
[302.40 --> 303.58]  and he decided
[303.58 --> 304.58]  that this was something
[304.58 --> 305.82]  that needed to be shared
[305.82 --> 307.02]  with the churches.
[308.90 --> 309.94]  That idea,
[310.18 --> 310.86]  that understanding
[310.86 --> 311.76]  never took root
[311.76 --> 312.58]  in Scotland
[312.58 --> 313.50]  or the UK
[313.50 --> 314.22]  for that matter.
[314.56 --> 315.44]  But it did
[315.44 --> 316.40]  in the United States.
[316.92 --> 317.44]  It became,
[317.94 --> 318.36]  in many churches,
[318.40 --> 319.06]  a real big deal.
[319.06 --> 321.68]  Most don't realize this.
[322.74 --> 324.04]  This history here.
[325.28 --> 326.10]  I was thinking about
[326.10 --> 327.10]  Mike Goheen,
[328.16 --> 330.16]  Dave's father-in-law,
[330.34 --> 330.52]  right?
[330.64 --> 331.70]  He's a professor,
[332.04 --> 333.42]  a brilliant mind.
[333.66 --> 335.74]  And he did a course
[335.74 --> 337.18]  on revelation for us
[337.18 --> 338.14]  in the early stages
[338.14 --> 338.82]  of the pandemic.
[339.38 --> 340.18]  And he said this.
[340.26 --> 340.82]  He said the real,
[340.96 --> 341.90]  in an email that
[341.90 --> 343.16]  he sent to my wife actually,
[343.52 --> 344.40]  and the real question
[344.40 --> 345.82]  about all these positions
[345.82 --> 346.90]  of end of time stuff
[346.90 --> 348.82]  is what is the relation
[348.82 --> 349.74]  of the power
[349.74 --> 350.74]  of God's kingdom
[350.74 --> 351.58]  to the present?
[352.20 --> 352.56]  And he said
[352.56 --> 353.92]  that's the more important question.
[354.00 --> 354.52]  And I think that's
[354.52 --> 355.42]  the more important question
[355.42 --> 356.28]  here as well.
[357.72 --> 360.24]  We in the reformed world,
[361.42 --> 362.70]  we rightly see
[362.70 --> 363.96]  that this is about
[363.96 --> 365.06]  the kingdom here
[365.06 --> 367.76]  and the kingdom not yet.
[368.44 --> 369.36]  And we live
[369.36 --> 370.72]  in between those two.
[370.72 --> 373.76]  So God's power
[373.76 --> 375.00]  to heal and renew
[375.00 --> 376.08]  is here now,
[376.20 --> 377.52]  but it will not come fully
[377.52 --> 379.16]  until Christ's return.
[379.72 --> 380.70]  And then there's a whole lot
[380.70 --> 382.48]  of speculation after that.
[383.04 --> 383.76]  And I don't want to get
[383.76 --> 384.54]  too much into that
[384.54 --> 385.08]  because I don't think
[385.08 --> 385.96]  that's what this passage
[385.96 --> 386.76]  is talking about.
[387.02 --> 388.32]  But let me just set
[388.32 --> 389.26]  a few things straight here.
[389.86 --> 391.36]  There's a scholar
[391.36 --> 392.44]  named Reinhold Niebuhr,
[392.70 --> 393.12]  and he said,
[393.24 --> 394.24]  we shouldn't concern ourselves
[394.24 --> 395.42]  too much with the furniture
[395.42 --> 395.98]  of heaven
[395.98 --> 397.56]  or the temperature of hell.
[398.14 --> 399.28]  Enough to be on the road
[399.28 --> 400.02]  with Christ.
[400.72 --> 402.78]  And I think that's true.
[403.58 --> 405.26]  I was reading a story
[405.26 --> 406.68]  from a pastor,
[407.70 --> 408.88]  and let me share it with you
[408.88 --> 409.60]  just to kind of
[409.60 --> 411.08]  set the tone here.
[412.52 --> 413.76]  This pastor writes,
[413.84 --> 414.70]  in one of my
[414.70 --> 416.80]  Pauline Epistle classes
[416.80 --> 417.74]  in seminary,
[418.16 --> 418.82]  Pauline Epistles
[418.82 --> 420.38]  is about Paul's letters,
[421.08 --> 421.56]  he said,
[421.64 --> 422.84]  my professor Andrew Banstra
[422.84 --> 423.64]  had just completed
[423.64 --> 425.40]  a rigorous and thorough defense
[425.40 --> 426.82]  of the reformed position
[426.82 --> 428.52]  on amillennialism,
[428.52 --> 429.44]  kingdom here,
[429.56 --> 430.16]  not yet,
[430.16 --> 431.52]  and the denial
[431.52 --> 432.80]  of the most complex
[432.80 --> 434.18]  timeline for the end of times
[434.18 --> 435.14]  associated with
[435.14 --> 437.04]  dispensationalist theology.
[437.74 --> 438.28]  So you see,
[438.36 --> 438.78]  they were talking
[438.78 --> 439.54]  about the end of times.
[440.00 --> 440.92]  And the class finished,
[441.18 --> 441.92]  and as we students
[441.92 --> 443.06]  were stuffing our books
[443.06 --> 443.46]  and notebooks
[443.46 --> 444.62]  into our backpacks,
[445.00 --> 446.22]  Professor Banstra said,
[446.80 --> 447.70]  then again,
[448.66 --> 450.16]  if the Lord Jesus returns
[450.16 --> 451.38]  and you meet him
[451.38 --> 451.88]  in the air
[451.88 --> 452.86]  and he starts setting up
[452.86 --> 453.56]  a thousand year
[453.56 --> 454.40]  kingdom headquarters
[454.40 --> 455.02]  in Jerusalem,
[455.02 --> 455.10]  Jerusalem,
[455.74 --> 456.00]  well,
[456.70 --> 458.14]  go along with it.
[460.38 --> 461.28]  And then he writes,
[461.36 --> 461.82]  in truth,
[461.94 --> 463.20]  none of us can fully envision
[463.20 --> 464.14]  what the end will be,
[464.50 --> 466.10]  but if it's Jesus
[466.10 --> 467.54]  and if we are with him,
[468.08 --> 469.00]  neither do we
[469.00 --> 469.76]  or will we have
[469.76 --> 470.80]  a blessed thing
[470.80 --> 472.42]  to worry about.
[473.70 --> 474.44]  And I think
[474.44 --> 475.26]  that's the right posture.
[476.14 --> 476.52]  Now,
[477.08 --> 477.88]  let me get into
[477.88 --> 478.64]  the passion bit.
[478.64 --> 480.58]  I think this passage
[480.58 --> 481.64]  is actually about
[481.64 --> 482.60]  something far more
[482.60 --> 484.04]  profound and beautiful
[484.04 --> 485.30]  than speculation
[485.30 --> 486.20]  about the end of times.
[487.00 --> 487.54]  I'm not saying
[487.54 --> 488.28]  that doesn't matter,
[488.70 --> 489.40]  but I think the passage
[489.40 --> 490.22]  says something else.
[490.84 --> 491.48]  For Paul,
[491.86 --> 493.68]  these aren't fighting words
[493.68 --> 494.62]  in a debate.
[496.06 --> 496.96]  These sentences
[496.96 --> 498.08]  were not intended
[498.08 --> 499.24]  to be dissected
[499.24 --> 499.62]  and used
[499.62 --> 500.16]  for an argument,
[500.30 --> 500.48]  really.
[501.18 --> 502.70]  These were pastoral
[502.70 --> 503.76]  words of comfort
[503.76 --> 504.48]  to people
[504.48 --> 505.66]  who were struggling
[505.66 --> 507.20]  with real faith
[507.20 --> 508.06]  alongside
[508.06 --> 509.92]  real death.
[511.76 --> 512.94]  Some thought
[512.94 --> 514.24]  believers wouldn't die
[514.24 --> 515.40]  before Christ returned.
[515.66 --> 516.20]  You see that
[516.20 --> 516.96]  even in a sense
[516.96 --> 518.80]  with the passage
[518.80 --> 519.74]  that Dave opened up
[519.74 --> 520.36]  with where Jesus
[520.36 --> 521.60]  died and the resurrection
[521.60 --> 522.08]  and the life.
[523.06 --> 525.58]  And Jesus had said
[525.58 --> 527.36]  to Martha
[527.36 --> 530.16]  that you wouldn't die.
[530.84 --> 531.22]  But that was
[531.22 --> 531.82]  the whole other thing
[531.82 --> 532.70]  we could talk about that.
[532.76 --> 533.58]  But these followers
[533.58 --> 534.26]  thought that.
[534.68 --> 536.22]  And so these followers,
[536.40 --> 537.16]  they're waiting
[537.16 --> 538.28]  for Jesus to return.
[538.36 --> 538.84]  They don't think
[538.84 --> 539.38]  they're going to die
[539.38 --> 540.10]  before Jesus returned.
[540.22 --> 541.28]  And then some followers
[541.28 --> 541.88]  died.
[543.72 --> 544.48]  Now what?
[546.82 --> 548.86]  These were gut-wrenching,
[549.06 --> 550.66]  tear-drenched questions.
[552.60 --> 553.58]  That's what Paul's
[553.58 --> 554.16]  doing here.
[554.76 --> 555.22]  In fact,
[555.46 --> 557.72]  it jumped to verse 18.
[558.04 --> 558.28]  Therefore,
[558.46 --> 559.60]  encourage one another
[559.60 --> 560.28]  with these words.
[560.34 --> 560.88]  And you see
[560.88 --> 562.10]  the pastoral care here.
[562.46 --> 563.70]  He reassures them,
[563.70 --> 565.08]  know the dead
[565.08 --> 566.08]  are not lost.
[566.38 --> 567.18]  They are still
[567.18 --> 568.18]  in God's hands.
[568.52 --> 569.72]  He encourages them
[569.72 --> 571.40]  in the face of death.
[572.96 --> 574.92]  What a human story
[574.92 --> 575.70]  this is
[575.70 --> 578.30]  with real spiritual assurance.
[581.30 --> 582.28]  I read something
[582.28 --> 582.66]  that said
[582.66 --> 584.30]  we all die twice
[584.30 --> 587.58]  when our hearts stop
[587.58 --> 589.70]  and down the road
[589.70 --> 591.44]  when no one remembers you anymore.
[591.44 --> 596.28]  I've talked to people
[596.28 --> 597.26]  who aren't believers
[597.26 --> 600.00]  and, you know,
[600.08 --> 601.18]  and done funerals
[601.18 --> 602.04]  occasionally
[602.04 --> 603.04]  for those who
[603.04 --> 603.56]  weren't believers.
[605.82 --> 606.70]  And, you know,
[606.78 --> 607.78]  they try to find
[607.78 --> 608.74]  comforts in this.
[610.08 --> 610.86]  He, she
[610.86 --> 612.06]  lives on in my memory.
[613.96 --> 614.98]  Yeah, for now.
[614.98 --> 618.40]  that goes to.
[620.26 --> 620.54]  Right?
[620.82 --> 621.78]  That goes to.
[622.44 --> 623.12]  And, and, and,
[623.12 --> 624.12]  and it leaves us,
[624.46 --> 625.10]  it leaves us
[625.10 --> 625.82]  with the question,
[626.18 --> 627.06]  did that person
[627.06 --> 627.62]  ever matter?
[629.76 --> 630.88]  Is that all there is?
[630.90 --> 631.54]  Is there more?
[632.38 --> 633.82]  And Paul is saying here,
[634.24 --> 635.16]  yes, yes,
[635.36 --> 636.54]  in Christ there's more
[636.54 --> 637.22]  and more
[637.22 --> 637.86]  and more
[637.86 --> 638.50]  and more
[638.50 --> 639.14]  and more
[639.14 --> 640.58]  and more
[640.58 --> 640.98]  and more
[640.98 --> 641.86]  and I can keep going.
[641.86 --> 643.80]  And Paul writes about
[643.80 --> 644.78]  death here
[644.78 --> 645.86]  as sleep.
[645.98 --> 646.36]  We're going to look at
[646.36 --> 646.92]  three words.
[647.06 --> 647.52]  As sleep,
[647.86 --> 648.22]  resurrection,
[648.46 --> 648.82]  cloud.
[649.04 --> 649.66]  He writes about
[649.66 --> 650.42]  death as sleep.
[651.44 --> 652.82]  Not unusual in Scripture.
[653.00 --> 654.06]  Matthew 9, 24.
[655.08 --> 657.00]  Jesus has been asked
[657.00 --> 657.92]  to heal this little girl.
[658.46 --> 658.68]  And it says,
[658.80 --> 659.46]  when Jesus entered
[659.46 --> 660.02]  the synagogue
[660.02 --> 661.82]  leader's house
[661.82 --> 663.22]  and saw the noisy crowd
[663.22 --> 664.54]  there mourning this death
[664.54 --> 666.82]  and people playing pipes,
[667.36 --> 667.80]  he said,
[668.02 --> 668.50]  go away,
[668.62 --> 669.84]  the girl is not dead
[669.84 --> 670.96]  but asleep.
[670.96 --> 672.58]  And they laughed at him.
[673.58 --> 675.32]  Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15,
[675.92 --> 677.04]  but Christ has indeed
[677.04 --> 678.04]  been raised from the dead,
[678.12 --> 679.06]  the first fruit of those
[679.06 --> 680.58]  who have fallen asleep.
[681.36 --> 682.14]  For since death
[682.14 --> 682.96]  came through a man,
[683.04 --> 684.04]  the resurrection of the dead
[684.04 --> 685.40]  comes also through a man.
[685.72 --> 686.42]  For as in Adam
[686.42 --> 687.16]  all die,
[687.30 --> 688.42]  so in Christ
[688.42 --> 690.28]  all will be made alive.
[692.22 --> 693.50]  In the ancient world,
[693.74 --> 695.36]  sleep with the word for death.
[697.48 --> 698.24]  And if you read
[698.24 --> 699.88]  in verse 14 and 16,
[699.88 --> 701.88]  we are reassured
[702.46 --> 703.78]  your soul goes to be
[703.78 --> 705.14]  with Jesus when you die.
[706.40 --> 707.32]  And eventually the body
[707.32 --> 707.82]  and the soul
[707.82 --> 708.50]  will be reunited.
[710.54 --> 711.72]  Paul then uses this word
[711.72 --> 712.88]  the cloud.
[713.10 --> 714.10]  We're caught up
[714.10 --> 714.74]  in the clouds.
[715.38 --> 716.64]  And throughout Scripture,
[717.18 --> 718.90]  we see the word cloud
[718.90 --> 720.88]  used as a symbolically
[721.70 --> 722.96]  charged language
[722.96 --> 724.18]  for God's presence.
[724.18 --> 726.38]  right?
[726.76 --> 727.78]  Think of Moses,
[727.98 --> 729.24]  Mount Sinai, right?
[729.50 --> 730.60]  God comes down
[730.60 --> 731.58]  to the top of the mountain
[731.58 --> 732.14]  in a cloud,
[732.28 --> 733.08]  thunder, lightning.
[733.54 --> 735.46]  God displays his presence.
[737.04 --> 737.84]  Daniel 7,
[738.66 --> 740.74]  wonderful vision Daniel has.
[741.00 --> 741.40]  He said,
[741.46 --> 742.46]  In my vision at night
[742.46 --> 742.88]  I looked,
[742.96 --> 743.82]  and there before me
[743.82 --> 745.36]  was one like the Son of Man
[745.36 --> 747.52]  coming with the clouds of heaven.
[747.98 --> 749.92]  He approached the ancient of days
[749.92 --> 751.72]  and was led into his presence.
[752.06 --> 753.02]  He was given authority,
[753.18 --> 753.44]  glory,
[753.54 --> 754.32]  and sovereign power.
[754.66 --> 755.80]  And all nations and peoples
[755.80 --> 757.16]  of every language worshipped him.
[757.38 --> 758.12]  His dominion,
[758.22 --> 759.34]  an everlasting dominion
[759.34 --> 760.50]  that will not pass away.
[760.76 --> 761.60]  His kingdom won,
[761.84 --> 762.98]  that will never be destroyed.
[763.92 --> 765.24]  And we have a beautiful picture
[765.24 --> 766.74]  of the coming of our Lord.
[768.70 --> 769.32]  Acts 1,
[769.70 --> 769.92]  Jesus ascends
[770.88 --> 772.02]  into the clouds.
[772.02 --> 773.24]  And it says,
[773.38 --> 774.26]  then he will return
[774.26 --> 775.70]  in the same way.
[778.22 --> 779.00]  And then Paul goes on
[779.00 --> 779.58]  to talk about
[779.58 --> 780.32]  all throughout this
[780.32 --> 781.38]  about that all
[781.38 --> 782.26]  will be resurrected.
[782.88 --> 784.66]  That there will be judgment,
[784.94 --> 786.14]  which is the end of evil.
[786.46 --> 787.44]  That there will be recreation
[787.44 --> 788.48]  and the healing
[788.48 --> 789.10]  and the renewal
[789.10 --> 789.96]  of all things.
[790.38 --> 791.18]  All those things
[791.18 --> 791.70]  are talked about here.
[791.96 --> 793.24]  All followers of Jesus
[793.24 --> 794.12]  believe that.
[796.38 --> 797.90]  The timing and the details
[797.90 --> 799.60]  are secondary.
[799.60 --> 803.04]  How it will all work out,
[803.38 --> 804.22]  to some degree,
[804.28 --> 804.62]  we'll see.
[806.28 --> 806.92]  And again,
[807.80 --> 808.80]  Paul wrote this
[808.80 --> 810.46]  to encourage hurting people
[810.46 --> 811.92]  who had real questions.
[813.08 --> 814.30]  And he says,
[815.04 --> 815.96]  very clearly,
[816.74 --> 818.76]  we grieve.
[820.76 --> 821.82]  We grieve.
[824.62 --> 826.66]  Not like the rest of the world,
[826.88 --> 828.06]  who have no real hope
[828.06 --> 829.26]  to hold on to, though.
[829.60 --> 830.78]  But we grieve
[830.78 --> 832.96]  with real hope.
[837.70 --> 838.30]  I've,
[838.80 --> 840.56]  on a number of occasions,
[840.76 --> 842.52]  used something
[842.52 --> 843.56]  at a graveside,
[845.28 --> 846.28]  something called
[846.28 --> 848.00]  the Heidelberg Catechism.
[848.94 --> 850.68]  An old document,
[850.82 --> 851.72]  confessional document,
[851.88 --> 853.40]  that we hold
[853.40 --> 855.88]  in our Reformed tradition.
[857.14 --> 858.14]  And there's these questions
[858.14 --> 858.70]  and answers,
[858.78 --> 860.20]  and this is the very first one
[860.20 --> 861.76]  that the writer starts with,
[861.80 --> 863.16]  and it's question and answer one.
[863.68 --> 864.48]  And the question is,
[864.56 --> 865.02]  what is my,
[865.22 --> 866.30]  what is your only comfort
[866.30 --> 867.26]  in life and death?
[867.72 --> 869.04]  And I think I have a,
[869.32 --> 870.60]  should be a slide for that,
[870.66 --> 871.00]  I think,
[871.16 --> 871.48]  I hope.
[872.24 --> 872.64]  If not,
[872.70 --> 873.72]  you'll just have to hear it.
[874.74 --> 875.36]  There we go.
[875.36 --> 878.88]  what is my only comfort
[878.88 --> 880.58]  in life and death?
[881.90 --> 883.82]  That I am not my own,
[884.82 --> 886.30]  but belong body and soul
[886.30 --> 887.44]  both in life and death
[887.44 --> 888.66]  to my faithful Savior,
[889.44 --> 890.20]  Jesus Christ.
[891.54 --> 892.54]  He has fully paid
[892.54 --> 893.40]  for all my sins
[893.40 --> 894.46]  with His precious blood.
[895.64 --> 896.62]  He has set me free
[896.62 --> 897.88]  from all the power
[897.88 --> 898.38]  of the devil.
[899.32 --> 900.86]  He also preserves me
[900.86 --> 901.34]  in such a way
[901.34 --> 902.00]  that without the will
[902.00 --> 902.78]  of my Heavenly Father
[902.78 --> 903.56]  not a hair can fall
[903.56 --> 904.14]  from my head.
[904.46 --> 904.68]  Indeed,
[904.82 --> 906.30]  all things must work together
[906.30 --> 907.22]  for my salvation.
[908.56 --> 908.94]  Therefore,
[909.38 --> 910.38]  by His Holy Spirit,
[910.66 --> 911.68]  He also assures me
[911.68 --> 912.52]  of eternal life
[912.52 --> 913.62]  and makes me heartily
[913.62 --> 914.38]  willing and ready
[914.38 --> 915.20]  from now on
[915.20 --> 917.04]  to live for Him.
[920.56 --> 921.90]  And I think this passage
[921.90 --> 923.42]  is in that vein.
[923.42 --> 928.38]  Jesus who said,
[928.54 --> 929.42]  I am the resurrection
[929.42 --> 932.18]  and the life.
[934.74 --> 935.34]  It does say,
[935.40 --> 935.54]  you know,
[935.60 --> 938.00]  after that,
[938.12 --> 938.32]  you know,
[938.40 --> 939.36]  that we're going to,
[939.50 --> 940.54]  all will be resurrected,
[940.70 --> 940.80]  right?
[940.82 --> 941.30]  After that,
[941.38 --> 942.64]  those who are alive
[942.64 --> 943.34]  then will be caught
[943.34 --> 944.16]  up in the air here.
[944.58 --> 945.90]  What do we do with that?
[946.20 --> 946.36]  Right?
[946.44 --> 947.22]  I know for some
[947.22 --> 948.14]  it's that picture
[948.14 --> 949.66]  of that idea of rapture here.
[949.70 --> 950.40]  But let me say,
[950.74 --> 951.78]  it's a beautiful,
[951.78 --> 952.68]  beautiful metaphor.
[953.42 --> 957.42]  We could jump ahead
[957.42 --> 958.28]  to chapter 5
[958.28 --> 960.04]  and it too talks
[960.04 --> 960.80]  about the end of times
[960.80 --> 961.38]  to a degree.
[962.34 --> 963.74]  And in there,
[963.84 --> 964.52]  it talks about how God
[964.52 --> 964.90]  is going to come
[964.90 --> 965.80]  like a thief in the night.
[967.28 --> 969.24]  And we immediately
[969.24 --> 971.06]  acknowledge that's metaphor
[971.06 --> 972.22]  because we know
[972.22 --> 973.08]  that the God
[973.08 --> 973.78]  who's coming back
[973.78 --> 974.62]  is not a thief.
[975.24 --> 976.42]  We know it's metaphor.
[980.20 --> 982.16]  We need to understand
[982.16 --> 983.32]  that this being caught
[983.32 --> 983.94]  up in the air
[983.94 --> 985.22]  is a picture.
[987.08 --> 988.48]  When scripture writes,
[988.62 --> 989.38]  writers write
[989.38 --> 990.24]  about the future,
[990.38 --> 991.54]  it's almost always
[991.54 --> 993.42]  in metaphors.
[994.68 --> 995.36]  Almost always.
[997.54 --> 998.42]  And he writes,
[999.10 --> 999.76]  says this,
[1000.12 --> 1001.38]  all writing about the future
[1001.38 --> 1002.26]  is a signpost
[1002.26 --> 1003.90]  pointing into the fog.
[1003.90 --> 1010.32]  I think Paul often used,
[1010.44 --> 1011.42]  I like how he used
[1011.42 --> 1011.98]  this phrase,
[1012.40 --> 1012.68]  you know,
[1012.96 --> 1013.62]  we see through
[1013.62 --> 1014.26]  a mirror dimly.
[1014.66 --> 1015.84]  We see through glass
[1015.84 --> 1017.02]  that's not particularly clear.
[1017.70 --> 1018.78]  Sort of the same idea here.
[1019.58 --> 1022.32]  We talk about this world
[1022.32 --> 1023.74]  outside of time,
[1024.32 --> 1025.20]  free from sin,
[1025.48 --> 1026.34]  free from brokenness,
[1026.42 --> 1027.02]  no more death,
[1027.28 --> 1028.16]  everything renewed.
[1028.70 --> 1028.80]  Right?
[1028.86 --> 1029.84]  That's what we're doing.
[1030.22 --> 1031.26]  We talk about that.
[1031.26 --> 1033.16]  And scripture uses metaphors
[1033.16 --> 1034.08]  to paint a picture
[1034.08 --> 1035.28]  of that future.
[1035.68 --> 1036.84]  And for some reason,
[1037.16 --> 1038.20]  people forget that
[1038.20 --> 1039.20]  when they read passages
[1039.20 --> 1039.78]  like this
[1039.78 --> 1040.80]  or books like Revelation.
[1043.88 --> 1046.58]  Paul has already used
[1046.58 --> 1047.86]  Caesar language
[1047.86 --> 1048.90]  for Jesus,
[1049.10 --> 1049.92]  as did Luke
[1049.92 --> 1050.86]  and other writers as well,
[1051.08 --> 1051.58]  where they said,
[1051.66 --> 1052.96]  Jesus is Lord.
[1052.96 --> 1053.08]  Lord.
[1053.52 --> 1054.80]  And they lived in a culture
[1054.80 --> 1055.32]  that said,
[1055.66 --> 1056.80]  Caesar is Lord
[1056.80 --> 1058.74]  and the followers of Jesus
[1058.74 --> 1058.98]  saying,
[1059.08 --> 1059.24]  nope,
[1059.64 --> 1059.82]  nope,
[1059.90 --> 1060.04]  nope.
[1060.68 --> 1061.50]  Jesus is Lord.
[1062.94 --> 1064.64]  And they used their language.
[1066.32 --> 1067.42]  In verse 15 here,
[1068.42 --> 1070.32]  let me find it for you.
[1070.50 --> 1070.60]  Okay,
[1070.66 --> 1071.02]  it says,
[1071.58 --> 1073.40]  according to the Lord's word,
[1073.52 --> 1074.36]  we tell you that
[1074.36 --> 1076.04]  we who are still alive,
[1076.32 --> 1076.66]  who are left
[1076.66 --> 1077.52]  until the coming of the Lord,
[1077.86 --> 1078.64]  will certainly not
[1078.64 --> 1080.86]  precede those
[1080.86 --> 1081.70]  who have fallen asleep.
[1081.70 --> 1083.96]  and then we come
[1083.96 --> 1084.64]  to that phrase
[1084.64 --> 1086.82]  that in verse 15,
[1086.96 --> 1088.14]  that the coming
[1088.14 --> 1088.98]  of the Lord.
[1090.96 --> 1092.32]  It's that same kind
[1092.32 --> 1093.52]  of Caesar language.
[1094.12 --> 1095.12]  This was a politically
[1095.12 --> 1096.28]  charged phrase
[1096.28 --> 1098.36]  used for Caesar's
[1098.36 --> 1099.14]  parousia.
[1099.82 --> 1100.94]  It's a Greek word
[1100.94 --> 1101.80]  that's used for
[1101.80 --> 1102.72]  his coming.
[1103.42 --> 1104.24]  We use it for
[1104.24 --> 1105.22]  the second coming
[1105.22 --> 1105.66]  of Jesus.
[1106.46 --> 1107.18]  Here's the picture.
[1108.24 --> 1108.90]  When the emperor
[1108.90 --> 1110.36]  made a public appearance
[1110.36 --> 1111.44]  to places like
[1111.44 --> 1112.04]  Thessalonica,
[1112.48 --> 1113.66]  it was called
[1113.66 --> 1114.48]  a parousia,
[1115.36 --> 1116.20]  a coming,
[1116.54 --> 1117.70]  a royal appearance.
[1118.76 --> 1119.74]  And Paul chose
[1119.74 --> 1120.26]  this word
[1120.26 --> 1120.82]  to describe
[1120.82 --> 1121.60]  Jesus' return.
[1122.08 --> 1124.20]  His royal appearance.
[1124.88 --> 1125.24]  Saying,
[1125.42 --> 1126.90]  Jesus is the world's
[1126.90 --> 1127.84]  true Lord,
[1128.28 --> 1129.48]  not Caesar.
[1131.88 --> 1132.76]  And then there's
[1132.76 --> 1133.20]  this phrase
[1133.20 --> 1134.06]  in verse 17,
[1134.38 --> 1135.68]  to meet the Lord.
[1135.88 --> 1136.48]  In the clouds, right?
[1136.62 --> 1137.12]  To meet the Lord.
[1137.12 --> 1138.78]  It's a technical term
[1138.78 --> 1140.44]  describing a delegation
[1140.44 --> 1141.52]  that would go out
[1141.52 --> 1142.46]  of the city gates
[1142.46 --> 1143.80]  if Caesar or a special
[1143.80 --> 1144.36]  guest showed up.
[1144.76 --> 1145.30]  And they'd go out
[1145.30 --> 1145.94]  of the city gates
[1145.94 --> 1146.94]  and they'd send
[1146.94 --> 1147.82]  a delegation to meet
[1147.82 --> 1148.94]  Caesar or that special
[1148.94 --> 1149.24]  guest.
[1149.68 --> 1151.22]  And if that delegation,
[1151.38 --> 1152.60]  if it was Caesar,
[1152.94 --> 1153.80]  that delegation
[1153.80 --> 1154.80]  would be the whole
[1154.80 --> 1155.26]  city.
[1156.40 --> 1156.94]  And they'd go
[1156.94 --> 1158.08]  outside the gates
[1158.08 --> 1159.12]  and they'd line
[1159.12 --> 1159.74]  the streets
[1159.74 --> 1160.82]  and trumpets
[1160.82 --> 1161.52]  would blare
[1161.52 --> 1162.38]  and people
[1162.38 --> 1163.12]  would cheer
[1163.12 --> 1164.82]  and a big hoopla
[1164.82 --> 1167.42]  would be displayed
[1167.42 --> 1168.20]  because Caesar
[1168.20 --> 1168.86]  was there.
[1169.92 --> 1171.00]  And then they'd
[1171.00 --> 1171.72]  walk back
[1171.72 --> 1172.62]  into the city
[1172.62 --> 1173.50]  to a temple
[1173.50 --> 1174.92]  or a monument
[1174.92 --> 1176.10]  and then Caesar
[1176.10 --> 1176.98]  would take
[1176.98 --> 1178.40]  his rightful
[1178.40 --> 1179.42]  place
[1179.42 --> 1181.76]  as the Lord
[1181.76 --> 1182.30]  of the city.
[1184.52 --> 1186.26]  And Paul is saying
[1186.26 --> 1188.72]  that's what's
[1188.72 --> 1189.56]  going on.
[1190.66 --> 1192.14]  That's the picture
[1192.14 --> 1193.36]  of Jesus' return.
[1193.78 --> 1194.78]  The king coming
[1194.78 --> 1196.22]  to claim
[1196.22 --> 1197.36]  and restore
[1197.36 --> 1198.82]  his kingdom fully.
[1199.36 --> 1199.90]  And we,
[1200.34 --> 1201.02]  the living
[1201.02 --> 1202.56]  and the dead,
[1203.68 --> 1204.96]  and the dead,
[1205.70 --> 1207.08]  will welcome him
[1207.08 --> 1208.72]  and walk with him.
[1209.04 --> 1209.68]  And Paul says
[1209.68 --> 1210.62]  to the Thessalonians
[1210.62 --> 1211.10]  and to us,
[1211.40 --> 1213.18]  so encourage each other
[1213.18 --> 1214.86]  with these words.
[1214.86 --> 1223.90]  look at that future picture
[1223.90 --> 1226.46]  so you can find hope
[1226.46 --> 1228.02]  in the present moment.
[1228.02 --> 1232.78]  this passage
[1232.78 --> 1234.44]  isn't really
[1234.44 --> 1235.74]  debate material,
[1235.96 --> 1236.68]  rather it's
[1236.68 --> 1238.46]  comfort at a graveside
[1238.46 --> 1241.28]  where we grieve
[1241.28 --> 1243.12]  with real hope.
[1243.12 --> 1246.14]  you know,
[1246.16 --> 1246.68]  it's interesting,
[1247.06 --> 1247.74]  many people
[1247.74 --> 1248.52]  in the Roman Empire
[1248.52 --> 1250.46]  believe that death
[1250.46 --> 1251.46]  was simply the end,
[1251.60 --> 1252.12]  that they've even
[1252.12 --> 1252.96]  found tombstones
[1252.96 --> 1253.60]  with this kind of
[1253.60 --> 1254.66]  wording on it,
[1255.00 --> 1255.52]  and I,
[1255.64 --> 1256.92]  I was,
[1257.32 --> 1258.32]  I am not,
[1258.82 --> 1259.74]  I care not.
[1262.24 --> 1262.38]  Hmm,
[1263.56 --> 1264.08]  there's a bit of an
[1264.08 --> 1264.64]  attitude there,
[1264.70 --> 1265.00]  isn't there?
[1265.00 --> 1267.52]  And I think many,
[1267.64 --> 1268.38]  many people today
[1268.38 --> 1269.30]  might feel the same way,
[1269.50 --> 1270.40]  although I,
[1270.40 --> 1271.62]  I think even more
[1271.62 --> 1272.44]  people are unsure.
[1273.80 --> 1274.36]  At least that's my
[1274.36 --> 1275.32]  experience with people
[1275.32 --> 1276.72]  when facing death,
[1276.80 --> 1277.26]  we all want,
[1277.38 --> 1278.24]  we all want to believe
[1278.24 --> 1278.66]  there's something
[1278.66 --> 1279.30]  more happening.
[1282.62 --> 1283.84]  Martin Luther King Jr.
[1283.84 --> 1285.06]  at a funeral,
[1286.88 --> 1287.72]  a difficult funeral
[1287.72 --> 1288.74]  for a couple of girls
[1288.74 --> 1290.18]  killed in a racist attack,
[1290.36 --> 1291.06]  imagine that,
[1292.12 --> 1292.86]  said this,
[1293.70 --> 1294.68]  and I also have a
[1294.68 --> 1295.46]  slide for that
[1295.46 --> 1296.14]  so you can read it
[1296.14 --> 1296.84]  because it's kind of
[1296.84 --> 1297.74]  a long quote,
[1297.88 --> 1298.48]  and he says this,
[1298.76 --> 1299.26]  picture this,
[1299.40 --> 1299.96]  graveside,
[1300.82 --> 1302.10]  people grieving deeply,
[1302.58 --> 1303.68]  two girls killed.
[1307.06 --> 1307.84]  And he writes,
[1308.26 --> 1309.34]  I hope you can find
[1309.34 --> 1310.56]  a little consolation
[1310.56 --> 1312.00]  from the universality
[1312.00 --> 1313.20]  of this experience.
[1313.70 --> 1314.90]  Death comes
[1314.90 --> 1316.42]  to every individual.
[1317.48 --> 1318.28]  There is an amazing
[1318.28 --> 1319.66]  democracy about death.
[1320.18 --> 1321.80]  It is not aristocracy
[1321.80 --> 1323.12]  for some of the people,
[1323.20 --> 1323.84]  but a democracy
[1323.84 --> 1324.84]  for all of the people.
[1325.50 --> 1326.34]  Kings die,
[1326.90 --> 1327.66]  and beggars die,
[1328.00 --> 1329.52]  rich men and poor men die,
[1329.80 --> 1330.82]  old people die,
[1330.90 --> 1331.88]  and young people die.
[1332.22 --> 1333.36]  Death comes to the innocent,
[1333.54 --> 1334.38]  it comes to the guilty.
[1334.72 --> 1336.76]  Death is the irreducible,
[1337.04 --> 1337.96]  common denominator
[1337.96 --> 1338.64]  of all men.
[1339.70 --> 1341.44]  I hope you can find
[1341.44 --> 1342.50]  some consolation
[1342.50 --> 1344.16]  from Christianity's affirmation
[1344.16 --> 1345.72]  that death is not the end.
[1346.10 --> 1347.18]  Death is not a period
[1347.18 --> 1348.32]  that ends the great sentence
[1348.32 --> 1348.72]  of life,
[1348.72 --> 1349.52]  but a comma
[1349.52 --> 1350.72]  that punctuates it
[1350.72 --> 1352.18]  to more lofty significance.
[1353.06 --> 1354.48]  Death is not a blind alley
[1354.48 --> 1355.64]  that leads the human race
[1355.64 --> 1357.10]  into a state of nothingness,
[1357.24 --> 1358.26]  but an open door
[1358.26 --> 1359.38]  which leads man
[1359.38 --> 1360.30]  into eternal life.
[1360.66 --> 1362.62]  Let this daring faith,
[1363.00 --> 1365.38]  this great invincible surmise,
[1365.74 --> 1367.40]  be your sustaining power
[1367.40 --> 1369.88]  during these trying days.
[1369.88 --> 1371.88]  Amen.
[1371.88 --> 1372.26]  Amen.
[1373.82 --> 1374.72]  Just picture that.
[1380.58 --> 1382.34]  That's the true story
[1382.34 --> 1383.16]  we live in.
[1384.88 --> 1386.32]  And in that story,
[1386.56 --> 1386.76]  yeah,
[1386.88 --> 1387.76]  we grieve
[1387.76 --> 1388.88]  deeply.
[1388.88 --> 1389.80]  deeply.
[1391.08 --> 1392.72]  We feel the pain
[1392.72 --> 1393.44]  and the sting
[1393.44 --> 1394.74]  of the brokenness
[1394.74 --> 1395.28]  and of death,
[1395.46 --> 1396.14]  and we do it
[1396.14 --> 1397.84]  without phony spirituality
[1397.84 --> 1399.56]  as if we don't grieve.
[1399.92 --> 1401.86]  Even Jesus wept at death,
[1402.68 --> 1404.44]  but we grieve with hope,
[1404.80 --> 1405.60]  real hope.
[1409.60 --> 1411.90]  I felt that
[1411.90 --> 1412.64]  and knew that hope
[1412.64 --> 1413.16]  last year
[1413.16 --> 1415.00]  when we buried my dad.
[1416.92 --> 1418.08]  And that same week,
[1418.08 --> 1418.90]  I did the funeral
[1418.90 --> 1419.76]  of a close friend
[1419.76 --> 1421.06]  who passed away
[1421.06 --> 1422.38]  looking at her husband
[1422.38 --> 1423.36]  and her son,
[1426.06 --> 1427.86]  sharing real hope.
[1429.22 --> 1430.66]  I felt that hope
[1430.66 --> 1432.82]  when my three-year-old nephew died,
[1433.08 --> 1434.24]  yet I've never grieved
[1434.24 --> 1435.20]  harder in my life.
[1438.90 --> 1439.50]  Grief
[1439.50 --> 1441.36]  and hope
[1441.36 --> 1443.76]  together.
[1445.68 --> 1447.34]  And not just
[1447.34 --> 1448.46]  with the word death.
[1449.86 --> 1450.92]  We were made
[1450.92 --> 1451.76]  for wholeness.
[1452.16 --> 1452.74]  We were made
[1452.74 --> 1453.32]  for walking
[1453.32 --> 1453.96]  with the Lord
[1453.96 --> 1454.96]  and with one another
[1454.96 --> 1455.88]  in right relationships.
[1456.16 --> 1457.04]  And we grieve
[1457.04 --> 1458.36]  broken relationships
[1458.36 --> 1459.48]  and harm done
[1459.48 --> 1460.16]  to creation.
[1460.16 --> 1461.00]  And we live
[1461.00 --> 1462.00]  in a kingdom come.
[1462.64 --> 1463.74]  Not yet.
[1464.84 --> 1466.12]  So not all
[1466.12 --> 1467.16]  is as it should be.
[1468.22 --> 1468.72]  Yet.
[1468.72 --> 1473.18]  all of us
[1473.18 --> 1474.30]  know disappointments
[1474.30 --> 1477.42]  where we say
[1477.42 --> 1478.42]  this isn't the way
[1478.42 --> 1479.16]  it's supposed
[1479.16 --> 1480.00]  to be.
[1482.50 --> 1483.44]  It's not supposed
[1483.44 --> 1484.16]  to be this way.
[1485.20 --> 1486.32]  That relationship,
[1487.26 --> 1488.46]  that disease,
[1490.10 --> 1491.54]  that pandemic,
[1492.54 --> 1493.82]  that racism,
[1494.46 --> 1495.48]  that addiction,
[1495.48 --> 1497.48]  that,
[1497.64 --> 1498.36]  and you can fill
[1498.36 --> 1498.96]  in the blank,
[1499.58 --> 1501.50]  it shouldn't be.
[1503.50 --> 1504.72]  And we live aware
[1504.72 --> 1505.78]  of the gap
[1505.78 --> 1506.70]  between what we
[1506.70 --> 1507.80]  were made for
[1507.80 --> 1509.38]  and where we are.
[1509.38 --> 1511.70]  and it's disappointing
[1511.70 --> 1512.50]  and it hurts
[1512.50 --> 1513.30]  and we grieve
[1513.30 --> 1515.08]  with hope.
[1517.36 --> 1518.38]  Anticipating a God
[1518.38 --> 1519.10]  who comes
[1519.10 --> 1520.38]  and comes again
[1520.38 --> 1521.22]  to not only
[1521.22 --> 1522.52]  put you back together
[1522.52 --> 1524.42]  but your relationships
[1524.42 --> 1525.40]  and your city
[1525.40 --> 1526.30]  and the nations
[1526.30 --> 1527.32]  and all of creation.
[1527.78 --> 1528.68]  So encourage
[1528.68 --> 1529.82]  one another
[1529.82 --> 1531.10]  with these words.
[1534.32 --> 1535.80]  Because they are encouraging.
[1535.80 --> 1540.02]  And then live
[1540.02 --> 1541.58]  with purpose
[1541.58 --> 1543.06]  and live with focus
[1543.06 --> 1544.26]  and don't waste
[1544.26 --> 1544.78]  your life
[1544.78 --> 1545.80]  on trivial things
[1545.80 --> 1547.32]  because how you
[1547.32 --> 1548.50]  see the future
[1548.50 --> 1549.62]  ought to shape
[1549.62 --> 1550.66]  how you live
[1550.66 --> 1551.74]  your right now.
[1553.74 --> 1554.78]  We as followers
[1554.78 --> 1555.24]  of Jesus
[1555.24 --> 1555.74]  ought to be
[1555.74 --> 1556.44]  the most hopeful
[1556.44 --> 1557.32]  positive people
[1557.32 --> 1557.96]  on the planet.
[1562.60 --> 1564.06]  This should motivate us
[1564.06 --> 1564.94]  to join in God's
[1564.94 --> 1565.76]  kingdom work
[1565.76 --> 1566.86]  right now.
[1569.90 --> 1570.86]  We don't look
[1570.86 --> 1571.72]  to the future
[1571.72 --> 1572.68]  hear me well on this
[1572.68 --> 1573.72]  to escape life.
[1575.60 --> 1576.40]  I think it's one
[1576.40 --> 1576.92]  of the flaws
[1576.92 --> 1578.94]  of some of the ideas
[1578.94 --> 1579.88]  of the ends of times.
[1580.50 --> 1582.32]  I think it allows
[1582.32 --> 1582.70]  some well
[1582.70 --> 1583.50]  and death
[1583.50 --> 1584.52]  you know
[1584.52 --> 1585.94]  I can check out now
[1585.94 --> 1587.08]  because you know
[1587.08 --> 1588.18]  I live happily ever after
[1588.18 --> 1588.50]  eventually
[1588.50 --> 1588.96]  so I don't even
[1588.96 --> 1589.72]  have to try now.
[1589.92 --> 1590.90]  That's not what's
[1590.90 --> 1592.00]  going on at all here.
[1592.28 --> 1593.36]  That's poor thinking.
[1595.76 --> 1596.74]  No, no, no.
[1596.82 --> 1598.26]  We look to the future
[1598.26 --> 1598.92]  to see how to live
[1598.92 --> 1599.48]  right now.
[1600.86 --> 1602.52]  So no escaping.
[1604.30 --> 1605.92]  Don't let your theology
[1605.92 --> 1606.78]  ever allow you
[1606.78 --> 1607.76]  to escape
[1607.76 --> 1609.48]  the life you live
[1609.48 --> 1610.14]  right now.
[1611.02 --> 1612.10]  Don't let a bottle
[1612.10 --> 1613.98]  or a video game
[1613.98 --> 1614.52]  or media
[1614.52 --> 1616.00]  or work
[1616.00 --> 1616.96]  or sex
[1616.96 --> 1617.54]  or whatever
[1617.54 --> 1618.64]  don't let any of that
[1618.64 --> 1619.82]  be escapism
[1619.82 --> 1620.92]  of where you live
[1620.92 --> 1621.52]  right now.
[1621.52 --> 1623.44]  live the kingdom life
[1623.44 --> 1624.04]  now
[1624.04 --> 1625.24]  and anticipate
[1625.24 --> 1627.24]  its future coming
[1627.24 --> 1628.90]  and the fullness of that.
[1629.36 --> 1630.52]  Grieve what isn't right
[1630.52 --> 1631.42]  right now
[1631.42 --> 1632.86]  and hold on to the hope
[1632.86 --> 1634.42]  of an eternal hope
[1634.42 --> 1637.18]  and then engage
[1637.18 --> 1638.28]  the world you live in
[1638.28 --> 1639.18]  with a hope
[1639.18 --> 1640.16]  found in Jesus
[1640.16 --> 1641.20]  and then help
[1641.20 --> 1642.12]  bring that hope
[1642.12 --> 1643.18]  bring that healing
[1643.18 --> 1644.40]  bring that wholeness
[1644.40 --> 1646.64]  wherever you are
[1646.64 --> 1647.82]  right now.
[1649.34 --> 1650.08]  Let's pray.
[1650.08 --> 1655.40]  Lord God
[1655.40 --> 1656.86]  we thank you so much
[1656.86 --> 1659.82]  for being a God
[1659.82 --> 1660.96]  who comes to us
[1660.96 --> 1663.88]  that you came
[1663.88 --> 1665.62]  while we were yet sinners
[1665.62 --> 1667.90]  and you lived with us
[1667.90 --> 1668.58]  and you showed us
[1668.58 --> 1669.10]  a better way
[1669.10 --> 1669.80]  and then you died
[1669.80 --> 1670.54]  and you rose again
[1670.54 --> 1673.40]  and you tell us
[1673.40 --> 1674.20]  you're coming again.
[1676.34 --> 1676.64]  And Lord
[1676.64 --> 1677.20]  that you brought
[1677.20 --> 1677.74]  your kingdom
[1677.74 --> 1679.02]  and yet
[1679.02 --> 1680.20]  it's not fully there
[1680.20 --> 1681.10]  and we get to work
[1681.10 --> 1682.48]  in that kingdom come
[1682.48 --> 1683.14]  and yet coming
[1683.14 --> 1683.80]  and Lord help us
[1683.80 --> 1685.54]  to live with hope
[1685.54 --> 1686.88]  with all the brokenness
[1686.88 --> 1687.62]  that we experience
[1687.62 --> 1688.58]  and all the disappointments
[1688.58 --> 1689.16]  that we experience
[1689.16 --> 1691.12]  to yet live with hope
[1691.12 --> 1692.88]  because we have hope
[1692.88 --> 1694.26]  real hope
[1694.26 --> 1694.64]  now
[1694.64 --> 1695.36]  and forever.
[1696.06 --> 1697.34]  Lord may we live
[1697.34 --> 1699.48]  in the kingdom now
[1699.48 --> 1700.42]  and the kingdom to come
[1700.42 --> 1703.86]  and may we grieve well
[1703.86 --> 1706.56]  and may we live well
[1706.56 --> 1707.74]  because we have a savior
[1707.74 --> 1708.44]  who has overcome
[1708.44 --> 1709.86]  and will come again
[1709.86 --> 1710.64]  in Jesus name
[1710.64 --> 1711.18]  Amen.
[1711.18 --> 1741.16]  Thank you.
