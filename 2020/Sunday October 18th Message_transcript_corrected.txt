[0.00 → 9.46] Good morning.
[14.76 → 17.56] I'm very thankful that I get this opportunity again.
[18.10 → 25.62] Last week, I was able to, I was given the chance to greet and welcome Hope's family into worship.
[25.82 → 27.44] And today, I get to share God's word.
[27.44 → 30.68] And so again, I am very grateful for this opportunity.
[31.50 → 38.08] And as I was worshipping together this morning, and as I was hearing the community prayer, the communal prayer,
[38.48 → 45.36] I was thinking to myself, huh, did my sermon manuscript somehow get into the hands of everyone that was serving?
[45.84 → 49.14] Because their confessions are a reflection of what I wanted to share today.
[49.70 → 54.48] Obviously, Dave being my supervisor, he knows of my sermon manuscript, so he had a copy.
[54.48 → 60.38] And I was suspicious. Did Dave make a copy and send it to our leader so that they had ideas for themselves?
[61.64 → 65.82] But all in all, we confess, and we worship God together.
[65.96 → 68.22] And so I'm very grateful for that today.
[68.82 → 74.36] And so as we continue in our Living in Hope series, looking at 1 Thessalonians,
[75.08 → 78.64] today we want to look at chapter 2 from verses 1 to 12.
[78.64 → 86.60] Before we do, I want to do a little bit of background, just a short background of why Paul wrote his letter to the Thessalonians.
[87.44 → 91.64] So when we look at the background and why Paul wrote this letter,
[92.16 → 97.12] Dave mentioned last week that the Thessalonian church was going through a lot of opposition and hardships.
[97.12 → 108.58] The main argument that we can find from Acts 16 says that they, so the Jews living in Thessalonians is accusing Paul and the Christians,
[109.04 → 117.88] saying they, Paul and his mission team, the Messianic Jews that they were called, the Christians, the followers of Jesus,
[117.88 → 125.42] they defy Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.
[126.22 → 127.86] This is from Acts 17, 7.
[128.64 → 137.06] It is then significant when Paul encourages the Thessalonian believers to have hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
[137.84 → 144.48] It is a very significant message indeed, one that Pastor Sid emphasized a couple of weeks ago in his sermon.
[144.48 → 151.82] The theme of perseverance is a very common and popular theme throughout the bigger biblical story.
[153.36 → 159.32] How do we persevere in the midst of hardships today, whatever hardships that we may have?
[160.40 → 162.34] Where do we base our hope on?
[163.92 → 170.60] And so it was interesting as Dave explained the word hope, the English word hope last week,
[170.60 → 175.16] because he wanted to clarify, in the Bible when Paul uses the word hope,
[175.80 → 181.66] he's not just thinking about just some earthly hope that something in the future might or might not happen.
[182.56 → 189.96] Like a hope I would have is in the future, the Vancouver Canucks would win the Stanley Cup.
[190.18 → 192.76] That would be a true legitimate hope I have.
[192.76 → 197.40] I really strongly hope that they win one, a real one.
[197.40 → 204.34] And so when thinking about this word and thinking about it in Paul's usage,
[204.48 → 206.26] it's not just that kind of earthly hope.
[206.58 → 210.34] It is hope in Jesus Christ that we are confident in,
[210.70 → 215.42] 100% sure that it has happened, and it will happen, that Jesus will come back.
[215.42 → 222.68] And so it's interesting because in the Korean language we have two words that connotate this meaning of hope,
[223.06 → 224.56] is 희망 and 소망.
[225.52 → 227.58] And in the Bible we use the latter.
[228.02 → 233.04] We use 소망 to signify the connotation of biblical hope, hope in Jesus Christ.
[233.80 → 238.72] And 희망 would be like I have 희망 that Vancouver would get a Stanley Cup one day.
[238.96 → 239.10] Right?
[239.14 → 239.90] That would be my 희망.
[239.90 → 246.30] And so that's kind of a preview of today's message, today's text, what Paul is trying to say.
[247.22 → 252.60] And so can you please turn with me to 1 Thessalonians 2 if you have your Bibles.
[253.10 → 255.06] If not, it's going to be on the screen for you.
[256.08 → 259.36] So 1 Thessalonians 2.
[259.36 → 267.00] You know, brothers and sisters, that our visit to you was not without results.
[268.00 → 274.54] We had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in Philippi, as you know.
[274.98 → 281.34] But with the help of our God, we dared to tell you His gospel in the face of strong opposition.
[281.34 → 288.68] For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.
[289.38 → 294.12] On the contrary, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel.
[294.96 → 299.46] We are not trying to please people, but God who tests our hearts.
[300.52 → 305.88] You know we never use flattery, nor do we put up masks to cover up greed.
[306.48 → 307.22] God is our witness.
[307.22 → 312.60] We were not looking for praise from people, not from you or anyone else,
[312.66 → 315.72] even though as apostles of Christ, we could have asserted our authority.
[316.58 → 320.30] Instead, we were like young children, or we were gentle among you,
[320.56 → 322.68] like a nursing mother who cares for her children.
[323.90 → 328.58] Because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God,
[328.86 → 330.32] but our lives as well.
[331.32 → 334.70] Surely you remember, brothers and sisters, our toil and hardship.
[334.70 → 341.22] We worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.
[342.16 → 348.72] You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous, and blameless we were among you who believed.
[349.60 → 353.84] For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children,
[354.66 → 359.30] encouraging, comforting, and urging you to live lives worthy of God,
[359.30 → 362.22] who calls you into His kingdom and glory.
[363.54 → 363.84] Amen.
[364.70 → 374.62] As I read and as I reflected on Paul's central message from this text,
[375.22 → 381.08] I was reminded of my days as a youth and also young adult growing up in a Korean church.
[381.44 → 383.80] I've grown up in a Korean church all my life,
[383.88 → 387.92] and Hope is only my second church that's not a Korean congregation.
[387.92 → 392.74] For Korean students living in the greater Vancouver area,
[393.06 → 396.48] we used to have these big, huge conferences called COSTA.
[396.76 → 399.40] I think it stood for Korean Student Association or something.
[399.86 → 403.52] And so we would have hundreds of kids gather in a big sanctuary.
[403.76 → 407.62] We'd rent a sanctuary, and we would gather together for our youth conference.
[407.62 → 412.60] And I remember at the time, we would have the best worship teams,
[412.60 → 419.94] and we would pay, or the staff would pay the most popular speakers to inspire our youth.
[419.94 → 429.86] But thinking and reflecting on that now, and me as a youth pastor now,
[429.86 → 436.26] speaking to young people, I think many popular preachers today, especially for young people,
[436.26 → 442.92] they have a tendency to use fancy words and exuberant skills of rhetoric to grab the attention of young people.
[442.92 → 452.24] Whereas these are not bad in themselves, it has, I think, a danger of what Paul refers to as flattery,
[452.24 → 457.86] to please the audience instead of trying to please God by proclaiming the truth of the gospel.
[459.32 → 461.32] I remember we had this one speaker.
[461.98 → 463.96] The speaker went on for a long time.
[465.14 → 469.60] Nothing against the speaker, but the message was really long,
[469.60 → 475.52] and you're speaking in front of youth who have shorter, and now it's even shorter in my opinion, attention spans.
[476.64 → 479.62] And so the speaker went on for about two hours.
[479.62 → 482.40] Without exaggeration, it was about two hours from my memory.
[483.20 → 487.86] And I remember when the speaker was done, everyone clapped before we prayed.
[488.56 → 489.96] They were cheering that we were done.
[492.60 → 495.96] Now, reflecting on it now, I feel terrible for that speaker.
[495.96 → 499.88] Being on the speaker side of things, I feel even more terrible.
[500.84 → 502.52] Imagine how that speaker felt.
[504.18 → 505.40] I didn't clap myself.
[505.78 → 507.08] I didn't cheer.
[507.38 → 508.12] I felt bad.
[508.48 → 511.20] And so I didn't cheer, but I remember in my heart, in my mind, thinking,
[511.96 → 513.88] man, am I glad that speaker is done.
[515.70 → 517.34] That was my honest opinion.
[517.34 → 527.50] And so I'm not intending here to be cynical and trying to trash talk the popular speakers
[527.50 → 530.06] or speakers who talk in exuberant ways.
[530.26 → 533.06] What I'm trying to say is that it should be,
[533.52 → 537.10] the text today should be a reminder of why we serve in our ministries.
[538.18 → 540.48] What is the focus of why we serve?
[541.82 → 543.32] What was the focus for Paul?
[543.32 → 551.62] He says that whether the gospel is received well, it is up to God.
[551.90 → 554.90] And he puts his trust in God alone.
[556.94 → 560.98] And so we ourselves do the best we can to serve in ministry,
[561.56 → 565.40] but we know, and we confess, as Paul says to the Corinthians,
[565.40 → 572.82] but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God
[572.82 → 574.06] and it's not from us.
[576.70 → 579.42] So as we dive into our text today in verse 1,
[579.78 → 582.74] Paul says that his visit was not without results.
[583.60 → 585.30] Or more literally, it wasn't empty.
[585.58 → 590.78] His visit to the Thessalonians was not empty of results because they had converts.
[591.32 → 593.60] They had people who really accepted the gospel.
[593.60 → 598.74] And that's his whole Thanksgiving that we looked at in the past two weeks of our sermons.
[600.20 → 603.12] The main focus of our ministry should be the same.
[604.06 → 606.42] People coming to faith in God,
[607.02 → 611.52] receiving the good news that God has redeemed us from slavery to sin
[611.52 → 613.70] through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[614.52 → 615.66] That is our main focus.
[615.66 → 621.40] And so as we reflect on this in our ministries today,
[621.66 → 623.24] we may want to ask ourselves,
[623.80 → 627.20] when have we been questioned about our motives?
[628.56 → 633.34] When have we been challenged about the message that we preach or teach?
[634.54 → 637.24] Are we preaching the gospel, the truth?
[637.24 → 641.22] Is that where our motives, our hearts are at?
[645.10 → 650.36] In verse 2, Paul continues as he reminds the Thessalonians of his sufferings in Philippi.
[651.24 → 655.42] He had put in prison, and through miraculous events,
[655.78 → 657.10] through the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
[657.10 → 660.32] he escapes prison, and then he travels to Thessalonica,
[660.48 → 662.26] where he continues his mission.
[662.26 → 668.96] N.T. Wright gives a great visualization of the context of the Thessalonian society
[668.96 → 673.00] and how they would have been very skeptical of any new messages
[673.00 → 675.40] or any new teachings that came their way.
[676.84 → 681.86] The Thessalonian society would have been very used to seeing travelling salesmen
[681.86 → 684.28] looking to sell their product.
[685.42 → 687.98] This could have been in the form of travelling teachers,
[687.98 → 693.62] people who try to make a living by offering their hearers fresh new insight or wisdom,
[694.16 → 696.78] some kind of magic, a new philosophy, or whatever.
[698.00 → 701.26] At the very least, in an honour and shame culture,
[701.48 → 703.00] which I'm very aware of as well,
[704.18 → 707.52] any new teacher that came into a new city or a new community
[707.52 → 709.78] would have wanted to make a name for themselves.
[710.08 → 712.04] That would have been one of the main motives
[712.04 → 714.34] behind whatever they were trying to sell.
[714.34 → 718.12] So even when I receive emails,
[718.44 → 721.26] and many people, you guys receive emails all the time
[721.26 → 723.50] about ads trying to sell you products,
[724.30 → 726.90] but you know almost instinctively right away
[726.90 → 728.64] that it's an ad,
[729.10 → 730.28] that it's trying to sell you something,
[730.40 → 731.96] so you put it straight to the trash.
[734.18 → 736.60] Hopefully you don't treat church emails that way,
[737.08 → 738.48] that you don't see it as an ad.
[738.48 → 745.96] So Paul goes on to give an extended list
[745.96 → 747.66] of what his ministry is not about.
[748.18 → 749.50] As we read in the text today,
[750.04 → 753.34] his gospel message is not an appeal from error
[753.34 → 755.26] or deceit, to be more exact.
[756.10 → 757.80] It's not from impure motives.
[758.44 → 760.44] It's definitely not out of trickery.
[760.68 → 761.86] He's not trying to trick anyone.
[762.14 → 763.42] He's not trying to trick you into,
[763.74 → 765.06] hey, Jesus might be the way.
[765.66 → 766.48] He's trying to trick people.
[766.48 → 768.38] No, that's his faith.
[769.78 → 772.78] And he didn't put on a mask to cover up his greed
[772.78 → 774.58] as if he was doing it for the money,
[774.82 → 776.30] which he did not receive, by the way,
[776.34 → 777.70] from Thessalonian church.
[778.32 → 779.70] He didn't try to please men
[779.70 → 782.62] or to receive praise from people by using flattery.
[784.28 → 787.44] If Paul was to be paid or given some sort of personal gain
[787.44 → 790.88] from providing this new sort of teaching of Christianity,
[791.18 → 793.12] then people would have judged Paul
[793.12 → 794.78] as having false motives.
[794.78 → 798.10] which in turn, most importantly,
[798.48 → 801.80] would have taken away from the legitimacy of the gospel.
[803.70 → 805.82] And so Paul is emphasizing here
[805.82 → 807.98] that his gospel is real.
[808.98 → 812.44] That even though he went through all that suffering
[812.44 → 815.04] and hardship and opposition in Philippi,
[815.54 → 818.26] he came to boldly preach the gospel.
[818.26 → 822.40] So he's defending his cause,
[822.56 → 822.92] saying,
[823.58 → 824.80] I'm not doing it for money.
[825.08 → 826.64] I'm not doing it for false motives.
[826.76 → 828.62] I'm here even though I know
[828.62 → 831.52] and I've been through all the opposition and persecution
[831.52 → 833.08] because of my faith,
[833.34 → 834.94] because of this message of the gospel.
[834.94 → 840.68] Does this not remind us of our society today
[840.68 → 842.38] when we reflect on this background,
[842.54 → 844.20] on this context of Thessalonica?
[845.40 → 848.40] Do you think that our neighbours,
[848.60 → 848.84] sorry,
[849.10 → 852.46] all around us would not be able to see through our motives?
[852.46 → 855.26] If we as the church,
[855.44 → 856.62] the body of Christ,
[856.94 → 859.52] are not motivated by Christ
[859.52 → 861.54] and preach about Christ,
[862.00 → 866.32] then where can anyone hear the message of the gospel?
[870.16 → 872.80] Where is Paul's heart at in his ministry?
[872.80 → 876.66] Through everything he went through in his ministry,
[876.82 → 879.06] which we will look at,
[879.44 → 880.62] he really wanted them,
[880.80 → 881.48] the Thessalonians,
[881.54 → 882.86] to hear the gospel message
[882.86 → 884.04] and that alone.
[885.84 → 887.20] And so Paul says in verse 6
[887.20 → 888.60] that even though Paul,
[889.06 → 892.32] as an authoritative apostle of Christ,
[892.62 → 894.40] entrusted to preach the gospel,
[894.98 → 898.22] he had the right to ask for compensation
[898.22 → 899.16] for his ministry,
[899.30 → 899.96] for his work,
[900.74 → 902.28] but he opted not to.
[903.38 → 904.28] From our knowledge,
[904.80 → 906.04] Paul had a separate profession.
[906.18 → 907.00] He was a tentmaker.
[907.84 → 908.78] And we're assuming,
[909.36 → 911.08] and many scholars assume
[911.08 → 913.50] that Paul would have provided for himself
[913.50 → 915.32] if he opted not to be compensated
[915.32 → 916.74] by the Thessalonian church,
[917.04 → 920.42] he would have done some sort of job on the side
[920.42 → 922.38] to provide for his stay
[922.38 → 924.50] during his stay in Thessalonica.
[924.94 → 927.04] And we're guessing he was making tents,
[927.84 → 928.50] making a living,
[928.76 → 930.02] working with his bare hands,
[930.02 → 933.20] working night and day.
[934.92 → 937.62] So why did he not opt to take any compensation?
[939.12 → 940.18] What was his purpose?
[940.98 → 942.28] What was he trying to show?
[944.06 → 945.90] He was trying to emphasize that
[945.90 → 948.96] absolutely nothing he wanted to take away
[948.96 → 951.98] from the legitimacy of the gospel he was preaching.
[951.98 → 955.96] Whether people accepted it or not,
[956.52 → 959.22] whether they persecuted him or not,
[959.80 → 961.82] he did not use some sort of bargain technique
[961.82 → 963.80] to sell his Jesus product.
[963.80 → 967.86] He entrusted his ministry to God.
[968.82 → 969.68] So in light of this,
[969.84 → 971.78] Paul also says to the Corinthian church,
[972.72 → 975.72] neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything,
[976.36 → 979.16] but only God who makes things grow.
[980.20 → 981.58] So all his trust,
[981.78 → 984.50] everything is solely dependent on God.
[984.50 → 988.90] His motivation and his message are centred on God.
[988.90 → 993.54] He wasn't looking for,
[993.62 → 994.98] if we're thinking of today's terms,
[995.26 → 997.16] he wasn't looking for likes on Instagram,
[997.66 → 998.74] or hearts, I guess.
[999.22 → 1000.50] Not the praises of people.
[1001.24 → 1004.28] Not about having his name known by others.
[1005.04 → 1008.90] But the message that Paul proclaims in his ministry
[1008.90 → 1012.22] was about God, and it was with God.
[1012.22 → 1014.88] In the end,
[1015.38 → 1016.94] ministry is God's ministry
[1016.94 → 1018.64] and it's not Paul's.
[1019.80 → 1020.88] It's not ours.
[1021.88 → 1024.14] Ultimately, all ministry is God's
[1024.14 → 1026.88] and we must solely depend on him
[1026.88 → 1028.08] and trust in him
[1028.08 → 1029.96] for our motives and our message.
[1032.68 → 1034.16] And so in light of this,
[1034.24 → 1034.88] in verse 7,
[1035.34 → 1036.76] Paul continues as he says,
[1037.12 → 1039.52] instead of these false ways of ministry,
[1040.64 → 1041.54] real ministry,
[1041.54 → 1044.92] that he expressed with his missionary team,
[1045.00 → 1046.56] so Timothy and Silas,
[1046.74 → 1047.88] what they were trying to do
[1047.88 → 1049.70] and how they expressed their ministry,
[1050.04 → 1050.68] how was it?
[1051.82 → 1054.16] By being gentle like nursing mothers.
[1054.82 → 1055.78] And later in verse 11,
[1055.86 → 1056.24] he says,
[1056.56 → 1057.90] like caring fathers
[1057.90 → 1060.36] who care for their children out of love.
[1061.06 → 1062.64] It's a family language.
[1064.84 → 1067.32] And so if we think of our ministries
[1067.32 → 1068.40] here at Hope,
[1068.62 → 1069.24] in a church,
[1069.30 → 1070.30] as the body of Christ,
[1070.30 → 1072.50] if we can truly think of ourselves
[1072.50 → 1073.74] as brothers and sisters,
[1074.06 → 1075.82] as the family of God,
[1077.44 → 1079.28] wouldn't you want to preach
[1079.28 → 1081.76] and share that good news of Jesus
[1081.76 → 1082.88] to our family?
[1084.62 → 1087.10] Or would you just want your family
[1087.10 → 1088.14] to come to church
[1088.14 → 1089.90] and just go through the motions
[1089.90 → 1091.04] of Christianity
[1091.04 → 1092.70] as if it were just a religion?
[1092.70 → 1097.88] This familial language
[1097.88 → 1099.02] or imagery continues
[1099.02 → 1100.20] in verses 9 to 10.
[1101.72 → 1102.88] What is the purpose
[1102.88 → 1104.00] of Paul emphasizing
[1104.00 → 1106.40] and reminding the Thessalonians
[1106.40 → 1108.22] of his righteous actions
[1108.22 → 1108.88] and ministry?
[1110.58 → 1112.16] As we look at it one more time,
[1112.34 → 1112.72] he says,
[1112.72 → 1113.56] surely remember,
[1113.94 → 1114.74] brothers and sisters,
[1115.70 → 1117.00] our toil and hardship,
[1117.50 → 1119.24] we worked night and day
[1119.24 → 1120.92] in order not to be a burden to anyone
[1120.92 → 1122.46] while we preached the gospel to you.
[1123.10 → 1123.84] You are witnesses,
[1124.06 → 1124.74] and so is God,
[1124.82 → 1125.66] of how holy,
[1125.86 → 1126.14] righteous,
[1126.26 → 1127.34] and blameless we were
[1127.34 → 1128.68] among you who believed.
[1129.52 → 1130.90] Is he trying to brag here?
[1131.58 → 1133.64] Is he trying to speak
[1133.64 → 1134.88] as if he was trying to gain
[1134.88 → 1136.42] his own personal glory?
[1136.42 → 1139.68] But we just looked,
[1140.58 → 1143.80] and he was explicit,
[1144.10 → 1145.00] and he was emphasizing
[1145.00 → 1145.86] how his motives
[1145.86 → 1147.20] were not about that.
[1147.26 → 1148.96] It was only about the gospel.
[1152.40 → 1155.64] So why does he emphasize this?
[1156.04 → 1157.32] And he even says,
[1157.44 → 1157.96] night and day,
[1158.02 → 1159.16] that he worked night and day.
[1159.62 → 1160.22] And apparently,
[1160.78 → 1162.46] going through just some
[1162.46 → 1163.08] of the research
[1163.08 → 1164.56] of why they say night and day
[1164.56 → 1165.44] instead of day and night,
[1165.44 → 1167.04] it's to emphasize
[1167.04 → 1168.16] that when you,
[1168.40 → 1169.36] when in the ancient,
[1169.58 → 1170.64] in the ancient world,
[1170.84 → 1171.92] when they went out to work,
[1171.98 → 1172.78] it was still dark,
[1173.14 → 1174.58] especially if you did hard labour,
[1174.88 → 1175.84] it was still dark out
[1175.84 → 1177.22] when you first went out to work.
[1177.50 → 1178.86] Kind of like what our praise team
[1178.86 → 1180.48] does for our morning services.
[1180.94 → 1182.02] It's getting dark.
[1182.88 → 1184.38] And so when they come to church,
[1184.38 → 1185.20] it's still dark,
[1185.56 → 1186.58] and hopefully it's still not,
[1186.58 → 1188.08] it's not dark when they leave,
[1188.52 → 1190.36] but it's working night and day,
[1190.56 → 1192.08] emphasizing how hard he worked,
[1192.40 → 1193.46] how hard he tried
[1193.46 → 1194.90] to not take away anything
[1194.90 → 1196.18] from the gospel,
[1196.80 → 1198.46] to not burden anyone
[1198.46 → 1199.38] from the Thessalonians,
[1199.56 → 1200.46] to not give them
[1200.46 → 1202.18] false accusations,
[1203.06 → 1204.58] false ideas of accusations
[1204.58 → 1205.38] that he's trying
[1205.38 → 1206.38] to sell them a product.
[1207.02 → 1207.40] No.
[1207.96 → 1208.70] He's just trying
[1208.70 → 1209.80] to share his message,
[1210.76 → 1211.70] the faith that he has
[1211.70 → 1212.48] in Jesus Christ.
[1216.98 → 1218.66] And so to conclude this morning,
[1219.06 → 1219.78] let us look at
[1219.78 → 1220.72] how Paul exhorts
[1220.72 → 1222.44] the believers of Thessalonica.
[1222.44 → 1224.78] In verse 12,
[1224.88 → 1225.36] he says,
[1226.08 → 1227.10] live lives
[1227.10 → 1228.40] worthy of God
[1228.40 → 1229.08] who calls you
[1229.08 → 1229.68] into his kingdom
[1229.68 → 1230.24] and glory.
[1232.80 → 1233.86] Shifting a little bit
[1233.86 → 1234.98] and thinking specifically
[1234.98 → 1235.64] for the leaders
[1235.64 → 1236.42] of our church,
[1237.42 → 1238.50] even though
[1238.50 → 1239.68] I'm still a newbie here,
[1240.18 → 1241.12] I had the privilege
[1241.12 → 1241.68] of witnessing
[1241.68 → 1242.38] the calling
[1242.38 → 1243.58] of some of our new elders
[1243.58 → 1244.28] and deacons.
[1245.92 → 1247.00] And so I'm thinking,
[1247.32 → 1248.26] what might God
[1248.26 → 1248.92] be saying
[1248.92 → 1249.52] to the leaders
[1249.52 → 1250.14] of our church
[1250.14 → 1250.80] in this text?
[1253.38 → 1254.36] Ministry is not
[1254.36 → 1255.76] about organizing people
[1255.76 → 1257.00] or setting up programs
[1257.00 → 1258.12] or building projects
[1258.12 → 1259.42] and counting attendance,
[1259.92 → 1260.74] although we have
[1260.74 → 1261.78] a beautiful building here
[1261.78 → 1262.88] and we're blessed by it.
[1263.96 → 1265.86] It is focused
[1265.86 → 1266.84] first and foremost
[1266.84 → 1268.32] about sharing
[1268.32 → 1269.38] the message of Christ,
[1269.96 → 1271.62] making Christ known.
[1271.62 → 1275.98] we need all these programs,
[1276.48 → 1277.58] but the focus
[1277.58 → 1278.46] should not be lost.
[1278.60 → 1279.22] Our motives
[1279.22 → 1280.64] should not be lost.
[1282.22 → 1283.20] I see hope
[1283.20 → 1283.80] as a church
[1283.80 → 1285.40] and it is a place
[1285.40 → 1285.96] where the leaders
[1285.96 → 1287.08] must be intercessors,
[1287.90 → 1288.36] caregivers,
[1289.44 → 1290.44] people who are invested
[1290.44 → 1291.08] in the growth
[1291.08 → 1291.66] of the body,
[1292.54 → 1293.58] people who serve,
[1294.02 → 1294.58] share life
[1294.58 → 1295.74] with one another,
[1296.24 → 1298.04] just like loving parents,
[1298.44 → 1299.20] as Paul says
[1299.20 → 1300.06] in our text today.
[1300.06 → 1303.14] We must continue
[1303.14 → 1304.12] to be this way
[1304.12 → 1305.20] and not just be
[1305.20 → 1306.44] about slick campaigns
[1306.44 → 1307.14] or become
[1307.14 → 1308.84] an institutionalized
[1308.84 → 1310.34] or professionalized
[1310.34 → 1310.96] church,
[1311.48 → 1313.68] which is sadly
[1313.68 → 1315.00] a lot of the case
[1315.00 → 1317.08] in Korean churches today.
[1317.74 → 1318.74] They reflect a lot
[1318.74 → 1320.90] of what American churches
[1320.90 → 1321.88] are going through.
[1323.38 → 1324.42] And so Michael Horton,
[1324.92 → 1325.60] who is a professor
[1325.60 → 1327.12] at Westminster Seminary,
[1327.46 → 1327.88] in his book
[1327.88 → 1328.98] Christless Christianity,
[1329.46 → 1329.92] says,
[1330.72 → 1331.88] Christianity in America
[1331.88 → 1333.22] is less interested
[1333.22 → 1334.78] in truth of the gospel
[1334.78 → 1336.30] than in therapy
[1336.30 → 1337.92] and more focused
[1337.92 → 1338.84] on consumers
[1338.84 → 1340.06] than making disciples.
[1342.56 → 1343.96] So what drives
[1343.96 → 1345.34] what we do here at Hope?
[1346.00 → 1347.88] Do we share Paul's heart
[1347.88 → 1348.56] for conversion
[1348.56 → 1349.60] and growth
[1349.60 → 1350.30] in the church?
[1350.98 → 1352.46] Does it compel us
[1352.46 → 1353.64] to share our faith?
[1353.64 → 1356.84] As much as we need
[1356.84 → 1357.82] programs to reach
[1357.82 → 1358.44] our communities,
[1358.94 → 1360.08] our neighbours
[1360.08 → 1361.02] all around us,
[1361.76 → 1362.70] they see right
[1362.70 → 1363.64] through any motives,
[1363.76 → 1364.64] any false motives
[1364.64 → 1365.44] that we may have.
[1366.88 → 1368.26] They need to see
[1368.26 → 1369.58] authentic witness,
[1370.40 → 1371.58] a faithful community
[1371.58 → 1372.78] rooted in the truth
[1372.78 → 1373.36] of the gospel.
[1375.22 → 1376.48] They need to see
[1376.48 → 1377.50] that the church
[1377.50 → 1378.62] is made up
[1378.62 → 1379.56] of a bunch
[1379.56 → 1380.90] of saved sinners,
[1380.90 → 1383.06] not just a group
[1383.06 → 1383.84] of holy,
[1384.04 → 1384.70] righteous people.
[1385.34 → 1385.88] We are,
[1386.02 → 1387.14] in the biblical sense,
[1387.36 → 1387.90] but we are
[1387.90 → 1388.76] saved sinners.
[1389.18 → 1390.02] That's why we are
[1390.02 → 1391.20] holy and blameless
[1391.20 → 1391.66] and righteous
[1391.66 → 1392.40] before God
[1392.40 → 1393.80] because God
[1393.80 → 1394.52] has allowed that
[1394.52 → 1394.96] to happen
[1394.96 → 1395.62] through His grace
[1395.62 → 1396.14] and love.
[1396.94 → 1397.44] And so that's
[1397.44 → 1397.88] our message.
[1398.32 → 1399.42] We are the same
[1399.42 → 1400.08] sinners,
[1400.48 → 1401.46] but we are saved
[1401.46 → 1402.10] through Christ.
[1402.36 → 1404.22] That is great message.
[1404.46 → 1405.38] That is really,
[1405.54 → 1406.06] perfect,
[1406.52 → 1406.98] encouraging,
[1407.40 → 1408.30] hopeful message
[1408.30 → 1409.00] that we want
[1409.00 → 1409.68] to get across.
[1410.90 → 1413.06] So brothers
[1413.06 → 1414.08] and sisters of hope,
[1415.30 → 1416.34] may we strive
[1416.34 → 1417.36] to find motivation
[1417.36 → 1418.64] centred on God,
[1419.24 → 1420.94] to be faithful witnesses
[1420.94 → 1422.98] to God's redemptive work.
[1424.60 → 1426.34] May we encourage,
[1427.04 → 1427.42] comfort,
[1427.94 → 1429.14] and urge one another
[1429.14 → 1430.84] to live lives
[1430.84 → 1431.88] worthy of God,
[1432.36 → 1434.62] to serve in ministries
[1434.62 → 1436.26] in whatever form,
[1437.46 → 1438.48] worthy of God.
[1438.48 → 1441.38] as Paul says
[1441.38 → 1442.66] throughout Thessalonians,
[1443.42 → 1443.96] for He,
[1444.12 → 1444.64] for God,
[1444.70 → 1445.56] has chosen you.
[1446.22 → 1447.22] He has called you
[1447.22 → 1448.12] into His kingdom
[1448.12 → 1448.62] and glory.
[1449.14 → 1449.70] And He
[1449.70 → 1451.08] who calls us
[1451.08 → 1451.80] to this kingdom
[1451.80 → 1452.50] is faithful
[1452.50 → 1454.38] and He will do it.
[1454.78 → 1456.24] It is God's ministry.
[1456.60 → 1457.54] It is His work.
[1458.02 → 1459.22] Have confidence in that.
[1460.12 → 1460.38] Amen?
[1460.38 → 1460.52] Amen?
[1461.56 → 1462.40] Let us pray.
[1462.40 → 1470.78] Father God,
[1470.86 → 1472.04] we thank you so much
[1472.04 → 1472.96] for this morning.
[1474.14 → 1475.70] I give you thanks,
[1475.88 → 1476.02] Lord,
[1476.50 → 1477.86] just like Paul gives thanks
[1477.86 → 1479.12] for the Thessalonian church,
[1479.48 → 1480.80] that we have so many people
[1480.80 → 1481.52] here at Hope
[1481.52 → 1482.98] who are willing to serve,
[1483.44 → 1483.88] who are willing
[1483.88 → 1485.02] to commit themselves
[1485.02 → 1485.56] to you.
[1485.56 → 1487.22] And Lord,
[1487.30 → 1488.22] as we reflect on
[1488.22 → 1489.40] your passage today,
[1489.46 → 1490.66] on your word for us today,
[1491.12 → 1492.84] help us to be motivated by you
[1492.84 → 1494.10] and help us to
[1494.10 → 1496.02] only preach about you.
[1496.64 → 1497.22] May the
[1497.22 → 1498.60] sole purpose
[1498.60 → 1499.42] and our focus
[1499.42 → 1500.72] of everything that we do
[1500.72 → 1501.66] in whatever shape
[1501.66 → 1502.62] and whatever form
[1502.62 → 1504.54] may be for your glory
[1504.54 → 1505.60] and for your kingdom.
[1506.20 → 1507.48] May we proclaim
[1507.48 → 1509.18] and share the good news
[1509.18 → 1509.68] of Christ
[1509.68 → 1511.00] to our neighbours,
[1511.20 → 1512.64] to our communities around us,
[1513.02 → 1514.00] to the ends of the earth,
[1514.12 → 1514.26] Lord.
[1514.26 → 1515.88] So we thank you.
[1516.12 → 1517.12] So I thank you again
[1517.12 → 1518.46] for Hope.
[1518.94 → 1520.06] I thank you for the leaders.
[1520.68 → 1521.56] I thank you for everyone
[1521.56 → 1522.16] who serves,
[1523.20 → 1524.48] whether they're seen or not.
[1524.98 → 1527.08] May it be for your glory again.
[1528.08 → 1529.22] So we thank you, Lord.
[1529.58 → 1530.70] We thank you, Lord.
[1531.30 → 1532.28] We give you all the praise
[1532.28 → 1532.78] this morning.
[1533.04 → 1534.06] And in Jesus' name we pray.
[1535.06 → 1535.40] Amen.
