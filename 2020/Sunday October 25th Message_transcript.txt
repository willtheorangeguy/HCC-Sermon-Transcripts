[0.00 --> 8.76]  well good morning hope it is good to gather around the word and dwell in the scriptures
[8.76 --> 14.00]  together this morning and again i want to say hello to those of you haven't seen in a while
[14.00 --> 19.34]  it's always nice to see the faces of our congregation and this morning the 9 a.m. and
[19.34 --> 23.00]  the 11 a.m. i see some new faces and we're just delighted that you can worship with us in person
[23.00 --> 29.38]  again i hope you have been enjoying this series on first thessalonians as much as i have i am
[29.38 --> 35.16]  coming to realize it has so much to say to leaders and every time i prepare a sermon i just can't uh
[35.16 --> 40.66]  i can't believe how much it's saying to the leaders of the church and uh this morning i'm going to be
[40.66 --> 46.58]  coming to the end of the first half of thessalonians uh just so you know in the big structure there's
[46.58 --> 52.20]  three prayers in thessalonians and two halves and the first half is really about gratitude and
[52.20 --> 56.14]  thanksgiving and giving praise to god for what he's doing in the church and the second half which
[56.14 --> 61.10]  pastor sid will be starting next week paul puts his finger on these places where there needs to be
[61.10 --> 66.30]  growth where there's these idols that need to be named and change that needs to happen and so that's
[66.30 --> 72.32]  going to be starting next week i get all the fun stuff so turn with me to uh first thessalonians 2
[72.32 --> 74.56]  i'm going to start reading in verse 17
[74.56 --> 89.38]  but brothers and sisters when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time in person
[89.38 --> 96.34]  not in thought out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you for we wanted to come to you
[96.34 --> 104.48]  certainly i paul did again and again but satan blocked our way for what is our hope our joy or
[104.48 --> 110.74]  the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our lord jesus when he comes is it not you indeed
[110.74 --> 116.90]  you are our glory and joy so when we could not stand it no longer could stand it no longer we thought
[116.90 --> 123.02]  it best to be left on ourselves in athens we sent timothy who was our brother and co-worker in god's
[123.02 --> 128.34]  service and spreading the gospel of christ to strengthen and encourage you in your faith so
[128.34 --> 134.82]  that no one would be unsettled by these trials you know quite well that we were destined for them in
[134.82 --> 140.10]  fact when we were with you we kept telling you that we would be persecuted and it turned out that way
[140.10 --> 146.08]  as you well know for this reason when i could not stand it any longer i sent to find out about your
[146.08 --> 151.54]  faith i was afraid that in some way the tempter attempted you and that our labors might have been in
[151.54 --> 157.70]  vain but timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love
[157.70 --> 163.22]  he has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and you long to see us just as we long to see
[163.22 --> 169.10]  you therefore brothers and sisters in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about
[169.10 --> 176.42]  you because of your faith for now we really live since you are standing firm in the lord how can we
[176.42 --> 181.78]  thank god enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our god because of you
[181.78 --> 188.26]  night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith
[188.26 --> 195.72]  now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus clear the way for us to come to you
[195.72 --> 202.04]  may the lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else just as ours does
[202.04 --> 208.04]  for you may he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our
[208.04 --> 212.58]  god and father when our lord jesus comes with all his holy ones
[212.58 --> 225.52]  but a week and a half ago while driving i was listening to talk radio because i'm old now and that's
[225.52 --> 231.18]  what you do when you get old and i was listening to an interview with two different people who had been
[231.18 --> 236.48]  separated from their loved ones one was separated from her fiance the other was separated from her family
[236.48 --> 241.38]  by the border closure between canada and the u.s and they were interviewing them on what it's been like
[241.38 --> 245.68]  to be separated from family so long and these two people were sharing their stories and also lobbying
[245.68 --> 250.90]  the government to create some concessions for family to visit but you could hear as they shared the
[250.90 --> 256.46]  difficulty in being away from their families the inability to just cross the border and they shared that
[256.46 --> 261.86]  because of work and quarantine it's impossible for them to see their family without losing their jobs
[261.86 --> 267.34]  the interviewers as they're asking questions made a clear point of saying what has it been like for
[267.34 --> 274.94]  you and in both cases they shared as they choked up the difficulty they were homesick they were so tired
[274.94 --> 279.94]  of being at a distance one even said honestly i was finding all the ways i could possibly break the rules
[279.94 --> 287.52]  and break the protocols because i just wanted to be home but in the end they were stuck they couldn't
[287.52 --> 291.96]  move they didn't have the power or the authority to break these things and they were at a distance
[291.96 --> 298.42]  feeling that homesickness now i'm guessing there's a few people even in our own church who might be
[298.42 --> 303.20]  going through that right now you have loved ones in the states and you just want to be with them
[303.20 --> 311.00]  and if you feel that you know what paul is feeling in first thessalonians in fact if paul had it hid
[311.00 --> 316.08]  with his way he would not be writing a letter he'd be with the church he's writing a letter because he
[316.08 --> 322.14]  can't be with the thessalonian church and if you know this letter you can tell that paul is just grieved
[322.14 --> 328.88]  by the distance he says to them we're like orphaned from you we are separated against our will we tried
[328.88 --> 334.16]  to go we tried to go we tried to go but we couldn't satan blocked our way and now i have to write you
[334.16 --> 341.68]  because i'm concerned about you and i love you when i read this passage i'm sure you felt what i feel
[341.68 --> 350.16]  and that is that paul really loves this church i mean there is such deep affection from paul to this
[350.16 --> 357.38]  little group of believers in thessalonians he just loves them so dearly and i think we need to
[357.38 --> 361.98]  understand that his love for them is not just because they believe the message which is true
[361.98 --> 366.98]  it's not just because he prays so night and day which is also true in our passage but it's also
[366.98 --> 375.22]  because he planted that church and he knows them like this is his faith family i don't know if you
[375.22 --> 379.60]  know any church planters or if you've ever been part of a church plant in the past but that bond
[379.60 --> 385.10]  between the planter and that core group of crazies who are bought in and sold out and they want to make
[385.10 --> 389.68]  this thing happen they're praying for the city they're visioning for the city that's a really
[389.68 --> 396.04]  deep bond in fact there might even be a few people in this room who are part of the plant of hope
[396.04 --> 402.14]  community church and remember that sense of dreaming and visioning and asking that god would use this
[402.14 --> 409.86]  tiny little core believers to bless the city paul loves this church they are his faith family
[409.86 --> 415.68]  in fact as jonathan preached last week which by the way i really wanted to preach last week i'm still
[415.68 --> 418.98]  jealous i didn't get to preach on it so i'm just going to say a few more words about what jonathan
[418.98 --> 423.80]  preached on but some of the language paul used he says to the church we were like fathers to who loved
[423.80 --> 429.62]  you we were like nursing mothers to you we were like children to you he uses as much family language
[429.62 --> 435.86]  as he could possibly use but here's my favorite line in chapter two he says we were delighted
[435.86 --> 445.94]  not just to share the gospel with you but to share our very lives as well when you picture paul
[445.94 --> 451.44]  planting this church preaching the gospel do not picture just a traveling evangelist
[451.44 --> 458.52]  picture someone who shares meals with these believers picture someone who sits down with them
[458.52 --> 465.62]  for extended conversations well into the night about faith but the work i picture paul counseling
[465.62 --> 470.12]  couples who are struggling i picture him sitting down with a young guy who's struggling at work with
[470.12 --> 474.72]  what it means to be a believer i picture him talking to single people about the difficulties of being
[474.72 --> 480.84]  single paul loved this church and i actually imagine this is not hard to imagine for me that paul
[480.84 --> 485.28]  worked with some of them just in this previous chapter paul says i didn't want to burden any of you i
[485.28 --> 490.96]  worked i made sure that i was providing for myself i can imagine paul working building laboring with his
[490.96 --> 499.80]  hands with his church he shared life with them and i think any healthy church will be a church
[499.80 --> 506.32]  where ministry is not just talking but the sharing of life the sharing of meals the sharing of worship
[506.32 --> 513.32]  the sharing of prayer the bonding together of believers and that's precisely why covid is so hard
[513.32 --> 517.96]  for church right now because it disintegrates that sense of shared life that sense of connectedness
[517.96 --> 524.28]  connectedness that sense of being one body together for paul this is not just a ministry project
[524.28 --> 532.52]  this is shared life and i have to say that it's worth pointing out that we have a pastor in our own
[532.52 --> 539.38]  church who's modeled this vision of ministry so well pastor sid many of you know him in fact you all know
[539.38 --> 546.68]  him he has been doing this kind of ministry for almost 25 years in our church sid is not and he he'll agree
[546.68 --> 551.68]  with this he's right there he is not a program builder he's not administrator he's not someone
[551.68 --> 556.26]  who concerns himself too much with the finances the details of the church but what he's very good at
[556.26 --> 562.02]  is sharing his life with the church he's the kind of pastor who will be in your backyard
[562.02 --> 567.88]  asking about your family asking about your kids talking about the struggles you're going through with
[567.88 --> 576.80]  and sharing his life listening receiving praying that's sid's vision and i just give thanks sid
[576.80 --> 581.96]  for the way in which you've done that for almost a quarter century a quarter century in march it will
[581.96 --> 588.10]  have been 25 years of sharing life in this particular community big shoes to fill for this pastor right here
[588.10 --> 593.80]  but we give thanks for that ministry that's not just words it's not just ideas it's not living at a distance
[593.80 --> 597.82]  it's sharing life and we give thanks to the lord for that yeah we can clap
[597.82 --> 608.06]  now where was i so paul's grieving his distance from the church he wants to make sure the church
[608.06 --> 613.30]  knows that if he could be there he would and he gives us very intriguing reason for not being there
[613.30 --> 618.88]  he says i tried over and over and over again to be there and guess what satan blocked my way
[618.88 --> 624.94]  don't you find that intriguing explanation in other passages in acts for example as they're
[624.94 --> 630.34]  doing these different different missionary journeys paul says the holy spirit directed us
[630.34 --> 634.20]  elsewhere and god seemed to work through the community as they prayed to make sure they went
[634.20 --> 641.38]  to this city and not that city but in this passage paul says satan blocked our way and i have to admit
[641.38 --> 646.48]  i'm a little frustrated that he didn't just write one more sentence about exactly what that looked like
[646.48 --> 652.30]  what did you mean paul when you said satan blocked your way from going back to be with the thessalonian
[652.30 --> 658.00]  church and there's a lot of different ideas given by scholars i tend to agree if i had to pick one
[658.00 --> 665.38]  reason it would be that paul sees not just persecution on the church and himself from corrupt people and
[665.38 --> 670.42]  corrupt leadership in rome he sees behind the work of these corrupt people that are seeking to kill
[670.42 --> 678.46]  christians he sees behind all that the work of the evil one who does actively seek to undo the good
[678.46 --> 685.36]  work of the church to undo the good work of jesus christ in cities and communities not just then but
[685.36 --> 691.12]  also now and so paul named satan as the reason he can't be there and satan by the way shows up again
[691.12 --> 696.28]  in verse 5 paul's not just talking about how satan blocked his way he says to the church very honestly
[696.28 --> 703.42]  like a good pastor i was afraid for you i was afraid that in my absence the tempter satan would
[703.42 --> 708.66]  have tempted you and our work to plant and to preach and to nurture your faith would have been undone
[708.66 --> 714.18]  and become in vain that's a very honest pastor there he says i was nervous that the same person
[714.18 --> 718.84]  who's blocking my way from being with you was also undoing the good work of faith in your small
[718.84 --> 728.62]  young believing community so what does he do paul can't go back it's probably because his life is
[728.62 --> 733.12]  that threat like he could be killed for returning he was chased out of the city and he knows what will
[733.12 --> 738.18]  happen when he gets back he can't go back this church is young some suggest it's only three or four
[738.18 --> 743.60]  months old that's a young church they are being tempted by satan and they're being persecuted
[743.60 --> 751.78]  and so what does paul do he sends timothy and he sends timothy to strengthen and to encourage their
[751.78 --> 756.74]  faith as they face all these challenges i want to read for you exactly what paul says in this letter
[756.74 --> 762.36]  about timothy's ministry he says we sent timothy who was a brother and co-worker in god's service and
[762.36 --> 767.46]  spreading the gospel of christ to strengthen and encourage you in your faith so that no one would
[767.46 --> 774.64]  be unsettled by these trials you know quite well that we are destined for them in fact when we were
[774.64 --> 780.68]  with you we kept telling you that we would be persecuted and paul says nonchalantly it turns out
[780.68 --> 786.88]  that way as you well know there's a lot to tease out in this passage and the first thing i want to say
[786.88 --> 792.14]  is it seems to me that timothy's ministry of encouraging and strengthening is a ministry for the
[792.14 --> 798.18]  church to suffer well that's basically what he gets sent there to do encourage them as they face all
[798.18 --> 805.34]  these trials to face them faithfully and to deal with the consequences and i don't know about you but
[805.34 --> 810.76]  i think whenever we bump into a passage on suffering and persecution and trials as western believers we
[810.76 --> 817.16]  need to pause and say what is the spirit saying to us because we don't live in exactly this kind of
[817.16 --> 822.74]  setting and we need to have it unearth some stuff in us and one of the things i think it needs to
[822.74 --> 829.34]  unearth is the way we preach and evangelize and disciple people for example oftentimes when we're
[829.34 --> 836.24]  sharing the gospel to people we say god loves you which is 100 true we say god has a plan for you
[836.24 --> 843.00]  which is a 100 true praise the lord but somehow in the west we translate that when we hear it to say
[843.00 --> 851.94]  god has a comfortable plan for my future god has a safe vision for where he's taking me it's going
[851.94 --> 859.46]  to be materially materially prosperous none of that is true for the church of first thessalonians
[859.46 --> 863.80]  this is not an easy plan to be part of in fact i think a lot of us would be like you know what
[863.80 --> 871.26]  i'm not sure i'm up for something so dangerous and insecure and unsafe and yet paul sends timothy
[871.26 --> 878.60]  say stand firm church don't give up the faith and timothy and paul as well as leaders today know
[878.60 --> 883.34]  there's two very strong temptations for the church whenever there's trials and persecution and pressure
[883.34 --> 888.88]  one is to give up and say it's not worth it just go with the flow go with what the romans are doing
[888.88 --> 897.40]  and avoid all the persecution and trial the other extreme equally tempting is to run away or just to
[897.40 --> 901.66]  be sort of an enclave community that no longer communicates with the city you just do your own
[901.66 --> 906.34]  little thing but in so doing you're no longer salt you're no longer light you're no longer blessing the
[906.34 --> 912.96]  city that christ himself has sent you to be in and so paul sends timothy and he says stand firm
[912.96 --> 921.36]  more than that paul seems to suggest and we don't want to hear this he says this is what we were
[921.36 --> 929.10]  destined for seeming to say this is what it means to be church and if you listen to his other letters
[929.10 --> 933.20]  and you read them you'll see that paul talks about suffering not once not twice but a lot
[933.20 --> 939.60]  and he seems to be saying as he writes to a lot of different churches when you come to jesus christ
[939.60 --> 945.86]  you place your allegiance in him you turn away from the idols of that society and you believe and give
[945.86 --> 951.48]  your allegiance to jesus as lord and his savior it's going to hurt because you're now going against
[951.48 --> 956.70]  the grain of society and for the thessalonians it was people who saying caesar is lord and they
[956.70 --> 961.74]  worshiped him they paid homage to him and the christians were saying jesus is lord and caesar is
[961.74 --> 967.14]  not and they suffered for it in different contexts it's going to take a different shape i think for
[967.14 --> 974.60]  christians in the west right now it's saying self is not lord money is not lord sex is not lord
[974.60 --> 980.76]  jesus is lord and when we run against the grain of those things there can be pain and trials
[980.76 --> 986.44]  you know just last week i was chatting with my brother-in-law mark he's a professor at regent
[986.44 --> 991.72]  college and they were talking in their class about what it means to be kingdom citizens and they were
[991.72 --> 997.12]  talking about how they care for the vulnerable they act justice and mercy and they have really an
[997.12 --> 1003.58]  ordinary conversation about the basics of following christ mark had a chinese student who is from china
[1003.58 --> 1010.68]  and returning to china after his time at regent raise his hand and say okay if i preach this
[1010.68 --> 1017.22]  when i get back to china i am going to be considered dangerous the government will be watching the
[1017.22 --> 1022.74]  government will be listening and they might very well arrest me for preaching and living this stuff
[1022.74 --> 1030.78]  it's okay he can cry so this chinese student says what do i do if i go back to china and if i preach
[1030.78 --> 1035.62]  and live this stuff i could get arrested by the government what do i do now if you were the
[1035.62 --> 1044.20]  professor what would you say what would you be your instruction to that student and the class had a
[1044.20 --> 1051.58]  very good and healthy conversation about what it means to be faithful to the gospel uncompromising
[1051.58 --> 1057.48]  in our obedience to jesus christ and yet creative and subversive in whatever culture we find ourselves
[1057.48 --> 1065.42]  a wise teacher once said to me that christians should never ever seek out suffering but they
[1065.42 --> 1071.80]  should never be surprised when it comes and the global church the witness of christians around the
[1071.80 --> 1077.16]  world which marie thank you for praying for they bear witness to the reality that as christians
[1077.16 --> 1085.02]  lean into christ they are faithful to the gospel there is suffering there are trials there is resistance
[1085.02 --> 1089.52]  that requires the church to receive the encouragement from leaders and from the encouragement of the
[1089.52 --> 1094.32]  spirit to say stand firm this is what it means to be faithful to jesus christ
[1094.32 --> 1100.98]  so what does paul put before them by way of encouragement well he says he sends timothy to
[1100.98 --> 1105.00]  tell him to stand firm but what he does over and over in thessalonians and this is why we named our
[1105.00 --> 1110.24]  series living in hope is he casts their eyes beyond the present to see what's coming in the future
[1110.24 --> 1115.88]  he helps him see beyond the present trials to the future hope and i want to turn your attention to
[1115.88 --> 1123.18]  my favorite part of this passage and that is in verse 219 this is what paul says for what is our hope
[1123.18 --> 1130.82]  our joy our crown in which we will glory in the presence of our lord jesus christ when he comes is it not
[1130.82 --> 1139.02]  you indeed you are our glory and our joy now that's a beautiful passage to us but given our context we
[1139.02 --> 1143.90]  probably miss one of the quickest associations that first century hearers would have when paul
[1143.90 --> 1152.56]  mentions crown guess what he's referencing the olympics obviously the olympics go way before our
[1152.56 --> 1157.48]  time and yes they already practiced then and here's how it worked in the first century when a person of
[1157.48 --> 1163.28]  power and a dignitary would come into the city oftentimes that city would hold olympics in their honor
[1163.28 --> 1168.30]  they would have the stadium was full they'd have all sorts of competitions and performances and racing and
[1168.30 --> 1173.50]  all the rest and then when a person would win an event they would get a crown or a wreath put on
[1173.50 --> 1180.16]  their head and they would celebrate in the presence of that dignitary you picture that now don't miss
[1180.16 --> 1187.18]  what paul is saying paul is saying church when jesus the great dignitary comes in glory and power and
[1187.18 --> 1194.78]  sits down as the king the great king i am going to boast in his presence and you church will be my crown
[1194.78 --> 1200.68]  you're the reason i celebrate because my work is not in vain and the gospel has power because the church
[1200.68 --> 1212.54]  is there hmm can you imagine pastor sid in the presence of jesus christ with the crown called hope
[1212.54 --> 1224.76]  paul has more to say about hope for the church not just that they can look forward to the future and
[1224.76 --> 1228.98]  know that paul is going to celebrate because of their existence but paul says to them you will share in
[1228.98 --> 1235.06]  that glory when jesus returns to eradicate sin eradicate corruption put an end to suffering and
[1235.06 --> 1243.10]  vindicate and celebrate he will enable those believers to share in his glory in fact nowhere
[1243.10 --> 1250.22]  does paul say it better than in romans 8 17 where he says i consider the present suffering not worth
[1250.22 --> 1255.40]  comparing to the future glory that will come and be revealed in the children of god when jesus returns in
[1255.40 --> 1260.64]  power think about that the present suffering christians in that context were likely dying
[1260.64 --> 1265.58]  for their faith and paul says this isn't worth comparing to the future glory that is coming
[1265.58 --> 1273.70]  and so church lift your eyes says paul and fix your eyes on what is to come wait patiently for that day
[1273.70 --> 1281.04]  when jesus will return and reveal his glory reveal his kingship to every ruler of the world eradicate all
[1281.04 --> 1288.42]  evil and sinful corrupt behavior and allow his children to experience freedom finally forever
[1288.42 --> 1298.02]  and until that time the church is given the spirit they're given the power and the comfort and the
[1298.02 --> 1304.08]  guidance of the spirit they're given leaders who encourage and strengthen and support as they wait
[1304.08 --> 1310.56]  and live faithfully and paul finishes by just giving thanks that that's exactly what's happening in this
[1310.56 --> 1316.98]  church timothy comes back to paul and he says paul it's happening they're standing firm they're not
[1316.98 --> 1321.32]  giving up on the faith they're not collapsing under pressure they're not hating one another living in
[1321.32 --> 1327.22]  love they're living faithfully what they believe about jesus give thanks and so paul ends with this
[1327.22 --> 1333.56]  incredibly thankful note saying we cannot stop giving thanks you filled us with joy and you prove that the
[1333.56 --> 1340.82]  gospel has power that's our passage in a nutshell so i want to ask the question that we've been
[1340.82 --> 1346.52]  asking throughout this series what does christ say to the church today here in clayton heights as we
[1346.52 --> 1354.84]  listen to what he says to the church in first thessalonians in the first century the first thing that hits me and i
[1354.84 --> 1358.54]  realize i have certain lenses because i'm a leader in the church but the first thing that hits me
[1358.54 --> 1365.42]  is that critical role of strengthening and encouraging in the church the ministry of timothy
[1365.42 --> 1373.10]  the ministry of all leaders in the church i think we can over complicate discipleship in the church and
[1373.10 --> 1376.96]  there's a lot of confusion about what exactly it means and what exactly it looks like to disciple
[1376.96 --> 1380.84]  but when i read first thessalonians it actually feels really clear and simple to me
[1380.84 --> 1384.80]  it's leaders like paul and then later timothy as paul goes to other churches
[1384.80 --> 1393.36]  simply coming alongside young believers encouraging them teaching them caring for them praying for them
[1393.36 --> 1398.08]  and in so doing watching them grow in their faith in fact you see paul right at the beginning of
[1398.08 --> 1404.08]  thessalonians saying just imitate us follow our example as we follow christ paul did not think he
[1404.08 --> 1408.70]  was perfect but he knew that he was following christ and actively seeking to be faithful and he says to the
[1408.70 --> 1414.90]  young people just watch my example and i think leaders in the church need to say okay our calling
[1414.90 --> 1420.38]  is to come alongside young believers and encourage them strengthen them
[1420.38 --> 1427.96]  i can't also help but see some connections between first thessalonians and our own today
[1427.96 --> 1433.28]  in terms of distance you know paul is lamenting the fact that he can't be with the church
[1433.28 --> 1437.22]  that they are there he's in athens he wants to be with them but they're at a distance
[1437.22 --> 1440.62]  he's experiencing social isolation before we gave it that category
[1440.62 --> 1448.58]  i think also one of the pains that we feel is that separation and the distance from one another
[1448.58 --> 1453.08]  and some of the difficulty that comes from it covid has not been an easy season for the church it's
[1453.08 --> 1457.46]  been a difficult season for a lot of people but it's hard for churches and everything i've read on covid
[1457.46 --> 1463.58]  suggests that whatever you were struggling with before covid is now a whole lot harder in this in
[1463.58 --> 1469.22]  in the midst of covid for example if you were struggling with your work it's probably a lot
[1469.22 --> 1475.88]  harder now or if your marriage was experiencing tension before covid it's probably having a lot
[1475.88 --> 1483.86]  of difficulty now if you were struggling with addiction before covid it's probably so hard now
[1483.86 --> 1490.16]  or if you were facing loneliness before covid you have experienced much deeper levels of pain and
[1490.16 --> 1498.72]  loneliness now does that sound about right and if all that is true that ministry of strengthening and
[1498.72 --> 1506.16]  encouraging is all the more important now and i speak on behalf of the pastors and the staff here
[1506.16 --> 1513.10]  when i say this is a time where we need people who are mature and seasoned in their faith to come
[1513.10 --> 1522.14]  alongside those who need that encouragement and support people who can just simply say how can i pray for
[1522.14 --> 1528.40]  you how can i care for you how can i speak into the pain and the trials that you are facing so that you can
[1528.40 --> 1536.66]  stand firm and we can stand firm in the midst of these specific trials and no our trials are not the same as
[1536.66 --> 1542.38]  first thessalonians but we are facing trials and we need people to come around us and support and
[1542.38 --> 1547.46]  strengthen our faith so we can live faithfully in the midst of those and one of the things i love about
[1547.46 --> 1553.82]  our church is that we've actually been given a good mix of seasoned believers and new believers young
[1553.82 --> 1560.04]  believers old believers and we're well positioned in my estimation to have this kind of informal discipleship
[1560.04 --> 1566.24]  happen don't you think and one of the things i'd love for you to do today right now this week
[1566.24 --> 1574.96]  is pray lord who are the people that i can strengthen and encourage who are the people in my life that i can
[1574.96 --> 1579.76]  really come alongside and who are the people i can just receive it from and just so you know it takes a
[1579.76 --> 1585.08]  little bit of humility to receive that care and say yes i want to be strengthened i need to be encouraged
[1585.08 --> 1592.08]  in this specific trial receive the care and this by the way goes from our oldest members to our youngest
[1592.08 --> 1597.74]  children youth young adults there are people that you can encourage and equip and even right now i see
[1597.74 --> 1602.86]  some of our youth leaders and i give thanks for the way you're investing in youth and children who have
[1602.86 --> 1609.54]  their own set of trials but we need this kind of discipleship in order to be faithful in this particular season
[1609.54 --> 1621.00]  finally let me simply say that we too need to lift our eyes i think the church and generally people in
[1621.00 --> 1627.30]  the west we can be so myopically preoccupied with the present we're living with our eyes like this
[1627.30 --> 1632.04]  and paul over and over again in thessalonians just says to the church do you know what's coming
[1632.04 --> 1639.26]  hope do you know what's coming you might feel so frustrated by the elections or whatever social
[1639.26 --> 1647.70]  ills are right in front of us but the future is secure when jesus hung on the cross and rose from
[1647.70 --> 1655.54]  the grave he sealed what's coming and that coming of christ gives us confidence and it gives us hope
[1655.54 --> 1661.56]  we can face whatever we face today knowing that there is a day when the great dignitary jesus christ is
[1661.56 --> 1668.04]  coming and he will put an end to corrupt leaders he will put an end to evil the satan the tempter will be
[1668.04 --> 1674.04]  eradicated from his good creation and you and i will live in freedom forever you can say amen to that
[1674.04 --> 1681.24]  that's coming and paul says live in that hope let's pray
[1681.24 --> 1693.86]  father we start by giving thanks that you are with us and we give thanks for the church around the world
[1693.86 --> 1699.10]  that bears witness to the reign of jesus in so many different cultures facing so many different
[1699.10 --> 1707.10]  trials and lord this morning we want to ask that we would learn how to encourage and strengthen the
[1707.10 --> 1715.28]  faith of our brothers and sisters in faith we pray that even in our local church we would learn how to
[1715.28 --> 1724.50]  nurture and pray and encourage the faith of those younger than us lord i pray that we would stand firm
[1724.50 --> 1730.42]  in the faith that the gospel would not just be an idea but it would be the whole of our lives
[1730.42 --> 1738.56]  for that to happen lord we need your spirit would you pour your spirit out on us would you encourage
[1738.56 --> 1744.94]  us to face the challenges we have right in front of us this week with confidence that the grave is
[1744.94 --> 1752.82]  empty and with hope that you're coming and when that day comes we will celebrate we will be full of joy
[1752.82 --> 1758.82]  and we will glory in your presence thank you lord that your work is finished and thank you that you're
[1758.82 --> 1760.42]  coming again amen
[1760.42 --> 1786.62]  i want you to know
[1786.62 --> 1787.58]  for
