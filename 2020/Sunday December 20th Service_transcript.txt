[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 62.00]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Thank you.
[122.00 --> 124.00]  Thank you.
[124.00 --> 126.00]  Thank you.
[126.00 --> 128.00]  Thank you.
[128.00 --> 130.00]  Thank you.
[130.00 --> 132.00]  Thank you.
[132.00 --> 134.00]  Thank you.
[134.00 --> 136.00]  Thank you.
[136.00 --> 138.00]  Thank you.
[138.00 --> 140.00]  Thank you.
[140.00 --> 141.00]  Thank you.
[141.00 --> 142.00]  Thank you.
[142.00 --> 152.00]  Thank you.
[152.00 --> 153.44]  Two more weeks for Advent giving.
[153.70 --> 155.30]  We're giving to a well in Sierra Leone,
[155.38 --> 158.32]  and we're also raising money to care for those who've experienced abuse.
[158.82 --> 162.06]  And we encourage you after the service to go on Church Center,
[162.20 --> 165.92]  and you can donate to either of those causes in the list you see there.
[166.24 --> 167.04]  Thank you so much.
[180.30 --> 181.22]  Good morning.
[182.00 --> 187.74]  And to those watching online, good morning to you.
[189.02 --> 190.24]  My name is Nana.
[190.58 --> 192.30]  I'm a member of Hope Community Church.
[193.24 --> 195.74]  And this morning I'm here for the community prayer.
[197.64 --> 200.26]  I would want us to bow down our heads in prayer.
[203.30 --> 207.24]  Our Father and our God, we give you praise, we give you glory.
[207.96 --> 211.06]  We thank you, Father, for your faithfulness.
[211.06 --> 215.12]  Your word says in Psalm 3, verse 5,
[215.12 --> 218.86]  I laid me down and I slept.
[218.86 --> 224.20]  I woke up for the Lord has sustained me.
[224.20 --> 228.76]  Of a truth, Father, you have sustained us.
[229.94 --> 233.66]  Through it all, you have helped us.
[233.66 --> 242.58]  You have delivered us from the snare of the fowler and from every noisome pestilence.
[242.58 --> 247.12]  Therefore, this morning, we say thank you.
[248.32 --> 249.94]  We honor you, Lord.
[249.94 --> 255.44]  Ebenezer, this is how far you have brought us.
[255.68 --> 260.82]  Even to the last month of the year 2020.
[260.82 --> 268.44]  We say, if it had not been you on our side, like where would we have been, Lord?
[269.56 --> 277.94]  Our prayer is that, Father, you will lead us to cross over even to the year 2021.
[277.94 --> 283.86]  With your goodness and mercy following us.
[284.56 --> 288.80]  With your countenance being lifted upon us.
[289.28 --> 297.74]  And let us walk, O God, in the corridors of your blessings in the year 2021.
[297.74 --> 306.22]  This morning, Father, we have gathered here and in our homes to receive your word.
[307.28 --> 311.48]  As your servant, Pastor Sid, stands to minister.
[312.92 --> 322.40]  Let your word, O God, come like an ointment poured forth to bring healing to the sick.
[322.40 --> 331.20]  Father, we are praying for our little Brooklyn who has gone through this surgery.
[332.24 --> 334.50]  We pray for speedy recovery.
[335.84 --> 340.60]  And we pray that, Father, you will perfect her healing in the name of Jesus.
[342.02 --> 345.10]  Touch her and make her whole.
[345.98 --> 348.72]  In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[348.72 --> 356.02]  Father, this morning we pray, committing all the churches in Cloverdale, O God, before you.
[357.54 --> 363.74]  Let your presence be seen in the house of the Lord.
[365.10 --> 372.64]  And let your word bring peace to the brokenhearted.
[372.64 --> 379.52]  Father, this morning we have gathered here and in our homes.
[381.78 --> 387.62]  Trust in that we shall not leave your presence the same.
[389.10 --> 390.42]  Those who are isolated.
[392.04 --> 394.54]  Those who have mental issues, Lord.
[395.80 --> 397.28]  We call on you.
[398.42 --> 399.78]  We lean on you.
[400.56 --> 402.14]  For you are our helper.
[403.56 --> 404.56]  See us through.
[405.88 --> 407.20]  Deliver us, O God.
[408.10 --> 410.28]  And make our life whole again.
[411.40 --> 415.02]  In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
[415.02 --> 416.78]  We have prayed.
[417.36 --> 417.78]  Amen.
[417.78 --> 418.24]  Amen.
[418.24 --> 418.28]  Amen.
[432.64 --> 436.42]  Good morning to all of you.
[436.78 --> 440.16]  It's so good to be with you.
[440.68 --> 443.66]  And it's so good that we can still gather.
[444.06 --> 447.86]  As we gather in unusual ways, we are still the body of Christ.
[447.94 --> 450.78]  And for that, I am grateful to be together.
[450.78 --> 460.36]  When I think about Christmas, I think about this God who put on flesh in order to be with us.
[461.02 --> 463.74]  And he came to be with all of us.
[463.74 --> 470.50]  In this series, we have been looking at how Christ came.
[470.50 --> 475.68]  And the original story involved God coming to all kinds of people.
[476.30 --> 478.28]  We call this a just Christmas.
[478.28 --> 486.48]  And we saw God entering the life of a teenage girl who has a miraculous but complicating pregnancy.
[486.48 --> 491.32]  We saw God coming to social outcasts like shepherds.
[491.60 --> 495.84]  Inviting them to be among the first witnesses of Emmanuel, God, with us.
[496.00 --> 499.32]  We even saw Mary and Joseph and Jesus fleeing.
[499.84 --> 500.74]  Refugee-like.
[501.26 --> 503.78]  Seeing that God is with those who are on the run.
[504.06 --> 505.78]  With those who are homeless.
[506.26 --> 508.36]  That God came for all.
[508.36 --> 517.04]  And we are inviting you, and we as a church, want to respond to that God.
[518.56 --> 525.00]  I read this poem that kind of talks a little bit about response.
[525.18 --> 526.02]  And let me read it to you.
[527.10 --> 528.06]  It goes like this.
[528.06 --> 532.54]  I was hungry, and you formed a humanities club and discussed my hunger.
[532.54 --> 538.42]  I was imprisoned, and you crept off quietly to your chapel and prayed for my release.
[538.74 --> 542.32]  I was naked, and in your mind you debated the morality of my appearance.
[543.26 --> 546.30]  I was sick, and you knelt and thanked God for your health.
[547.18 --> 552.56]  I was homeless, and you preached to me of the spiritual shelter of the love of God.
[553.36 --> 556.24]  I was lonely, and you left me alone to go pray for me.
[557.48 --> 560.10]  You seem so holy, so close to God.
[560.10 --> 565.72]  But I am still very hungry, and lonely, and cold.
[569.48 --> 572.62]  Jesus does similar things in the story in Matthew.
[572.78 --> 577.30]  And we read in Matthew 25, when he tells this story, where it says,
[577.40 --> 580.82]  Then the righteous will ask, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you?
[580.90 --> 582.72]  Or thirsty and give you something to drink?
[582.98 --> 585.56]  When did we see you a stranger and invite you in?
[585.72 --> 587.42]  Or needing clothes and clothe you?
[587.42 --> 591.40]  When did we see you sick or in prison and go visit you?
[591.70 --> 597.80]  And the king will reply, Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine,
[598.00 --> 599.50]  you did for me.
[602.94 --> 609.46]  This is a God for all people, who comes to all people in all circumstance.
[609.46 --> 612.96]  And this is a God who invites us to do the same.
[615.24 --> 619.16]  Today, we are looking at Simeon and Anna.
[620.46 --> 622.02]  Devout elderly people.
[623.80 --> 626.84]  I wonder why Dave asked me to preach on this one.
[626.84 --> 634.72]  Nonetheless, people who have learned to hold on to faith, these elderly people,
[635.12 --> 639.98]  in the long journey of life, are worth listening to, worth looking at.
[641.44 --> 644.20]  You know, that's why the title is A Word from the Wise.
[644.34 --> 646.68]  And if you thought it was about the wise men, it's not.
[646.74 --> 651.22]  It's about these old people who have been there with the Lord for a long time.
[651.22 --> 657.18]  We've been discussing how God has come to all these outcasts,
[657.28 --> 659.54]  and He calls us to do the same.
[659.88 --> 662.46]  To see where there's a need, to see where there's a hurt,
[662.76 --> 664.78]  and to get into that space somehow.
[665.24 --> 667.58]  That's what we're trying to celebrate here.
[668.02 --> 670.78]  The good news of the gospel for all people.
[671.78 --> 674.70]  So let's jump into this passage this morning out of Luke 2.
[675.80 --> 678.58]  We're a little bit after the time of Jesus' birth here.
[679.52 --> 680.84]  Forty days later, actually.
[680.84 --> 682.20]  In Luke 2 we read,
[682.90 --> 687.24]  When the time came for the purification rites required by the law of Moses,
[688.04 --> 692.28]  Joseph and Mary took Jesus to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord.
[693.04 --> 694.80]  As it is written in the law of the Lord,
[694.94 --> 697.92]  every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord,
[698.74 --> 703.02]  and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the law of the Lord,
[703.36 --> 706.04]  a pair of doves or two young pigeons.
[707.04 --> 709.24]  Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon,
[709.24 --> 710.90]  who was righteous and devout,
[711.02 --> 713.24]  and he was waiting for the consolation of Israel,
[713.54 --> 715.58]  and the Holy Spirit was on him.
[716.58 --> 720.30]  It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die
[720.30 --> 722.54]  before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.
[722.54 --> 726.40]  Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts.
[726.84 --> 732.96]  And when the parents brought the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the law required,
[733.36 --> 736.66]  Simeon took Jesus in his arms and praised God, saying,
[736.66 --> 743.54]  Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you may now dismiss your servant in peace.
[744.50 --> 749.58]  For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all nations,
[749.92 --> 754.82]  a light for revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel.
[755.96 --> 759.66]  The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.
[759.66 --> 763.30]  And then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother,
[763.68 --> 768.00]  This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel,
[768.38 --> 770.94]  and to be a sign that will be spoken against,
[771.66 --> 774.64]  so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed,
[775.70 --> 779.74]  and a sword will pierce your own soul too.
[781.10 --> 785.80]  There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Peniel, of the tribe of Asher.
[785.80 --> 789.62]  She was very old. She had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,
[789.70 --> 793.10]  and then with a widow until she was 84.
[794.12 --> 797.00]  She never left the temple but worshipped night and day,
[797.82 --> 801.64]  fasting and praying, and coming up to them at that very moment.
[801.78 --> 805.44]  She gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all
[805.44 --> 809.54]  who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.
[809.54 --> 818.04]  Having children is a profound and amazing experience.
[819.24 --> 822.56]  My wife and I have four children, and they're all growing up now,
[822.74 --> 826.88]  but I can still remember the joy and, to some degree,
[826.96 --> 828.66]  the exhaustion of a baby in the house,
[829.54 --> 832.40]  especially your first child,
[833.40 --> 835.98]  and our first child who just turned 41.
[835.98 --> 838.58]  I was thinking back.
[838.78 --> 841.22]  I couldn't believe with that first child,
[841.28 --> 846.72]  I couldn't believe that the hospital was actually letting us go with this baby home.
[847.50 --> 849.40]  I wanted to yell back at them,
[850.00 --> 852.08]  we don't know what we're doing.
[852.90 --> 854.22]  You shouldn't be doing this.
[855.20 --> 857.40]  We obviously figured it out,
[858.02 --> 859.88]  and then we had grandkids,
[860.04 --> 862.14]  and what a joy and what a gift that is,
[862.68 --> 863.44]  all ten of them.
[863.44 --> 866.60]  And you look at them,
[866.84 --> 867.92]  and when you're grandparents,
[868.12 --> 872.30]  you look at them through the eyes of your experience raising children
[872.30 --> 875.10]  and watching your children raise children.
[876.76 --> 877.74]  And you're reminded,
[877.98 --> 880.20]  and I'm sure every grandparent says it too often,
[880.36 --> 881.44]  but it's worth saying,
[881.54 --> 883.74]  you remind your kids and your grandkids,
[884.20 --> 885.38]  it all goes so fast.
[885.38 --> 891.32]  And you spend time wondering what their lives will be like,
[892.24 --> 895.04]  and you pray a lot.
[896.44 --> 897.16]  A lot.
[898.22 --> 900.78]  You know there's going to be ups and downs,
[901.78 --> 903.92]  and you pray deeply that no matter what,
[904.42 --> 906.60]  they will walk with the Lord.
[906.60 --> 910.48]  You see all that holy potential.
[912.56 --> 913.32]  When you're young,
[913.46 --> 914.82]  you tend to live in the moments,
[915.12 --> 916.96]  you go through them quickly,
[917.42 --> 918.48]  don't do much reflecting.
[918.82 --> 919.66]  But when you're older,
[920.14 --> 921.74]  you're in those moments too,
[922.08 --> 923.62]  but you're somewhat on the sidelines,
[924.04 --> 925.64]  and you're watching,
[926.00 --> 928.38]  and you watch with a lived perspective.
[928.38 --> 933.18]  I want to encourage the younger people out there
[933.18 --> 937.66]  to take advantage of that lived perspective of older people.
[939.10 --> 941.82]  It's just a wise thing to do
[941.82 --> 944.08]  to seek the wisdom of someone
[944.08 --> 946.88]  who has traversed the journey you are on.
[948.90 --> 950.32]  And don't get me wrong,
[950.66 --> 952.64]  older people can learn a lot from younger people.
[952.72 --> 955.20]  I'm not suggesting older people know everything.
[955.40 --> 957.20]  They probably made a lot of mistakes
[957.20 --> 958.48]  along the way that they've learned from them.
[958.52 --> 960.08]  Maybe they want you to avoid those mistakes.
[960.66 --> 963.56]  But there is nothing that teaches life like experience.
[965.22 --> 966.54]  In this Hebrew culture,
[966.84 --> 968.88]  this was acknowledged and this was important.
[970.62 --> 971.94]  In Scripture we read often,
[972.06 --> 973.46]  listen to those who have gone before you.
[974.88 --> 976.48]  I read a quote recently.
[976.58 --> 976.78]  It said,
[976.88 --> 977.82]  Respect your elders.
[978.44 --> 979.98]  They made it through high school
[979.98 --> 981.72]  without Google or Wikipedia.
[983.38 --> 984.42]  And some of you might be wondering,
[984.56 --> 985.52]  how is that even possible?
[987.20 --> 991.48]  Luke points out two senior citizens in the temple,
[992.56 --> 993.28]  Simeon and Adam.
[994.00 --> 995.04]  Both faithful,
[995.78 --> 1000.26]  both having learned to wait upon the Lord.
[1002.16 --> 1003.86]  I was laying awake last night
[1003.86 --> 1007.42]  about four in the morning.
[1008.44 --> 1010.44]  I was sort of thinking about
[1010.44 --> 1012.14]  what I'm going to say this morning.
[1012.14 --> 1014.60]  And that whole idea of waiting
[1014.60 --> 1016.72]  was sinking in a little bit deeper with me.
[1017.36 --> 1018.56]  This idea of waiting.
[1018.88 --> 1021.92]  I think we've all had our waiting capacity
[1021.92 --> 1023.84]  growing during this time of COVID
[1023.84 --> 1024.96]  and waiting for vaccine
[1024.96 --> 1026.48]  and waiting for everything to go back to normal.
[1027.04 --> 1028.70]  Waiting is a powerful thing.
[1028.80 --> 1031.28]  It's a powerful shaping instrument that God uses.
[1031.28 --> 1033.20]  And Luke is saying,
[1033.32 --> 1034.96]  these two waited.
[1037.12 --> 1037.60]  Waited.
[1037.90 --> 1039.12]  A long, long time.
[1040.02 --> 1042.78]  And that's what faithfulness looks like.
[1045.38 --> 1047.00]  That's what it is to be shaped
[1047.00 --> 1049.48]  by God's Word and by the Holy Spirit.
[1049.48 --> 1050.90]  You know, Simeon,
[1050.98 --> 1052.84]  he's called righteous and devout.
[1053.12 --> 1055.58]  And the waiting is highlighted again too.
[1056.02 --> 1058.68]  And it says the Holy Spirit was on him.
[1059.76 --> 1063.66]  And his name literally means to hear.
[1063.66 --> 1067.34]  So Luke is saying,
[1067.60 --> 1069.54]  listen to this man of God
[1069.54 --> 1071.34]  who knows how to wait,
[1072.16 --> 1073.40]  who knows how to listen.
[1074.72 --> 1076.16]  He knows the Torah,
[1076.40 --> 1077.16]  the Scripture,
[1077.64 --> 1078.28]  the Word of God.
[1078.50 --> 1080.86]  And he cherishes those words.
[1081.22 --> 1082.36]  He's righteous,
[1082.76 --> 1084.54]  meaning he lives by those words.
[1084.72 --> 1086.36]  He doesn't just know the Scriptures,
[1086.50 --> 1087.10]  he lives them.
[1087.30 --> 1088.12]  And when Scripture says,
[1088.54 --> 1089.62]  do this, he did it.
[1089.74 --> 1090.30]  And when Scripture says,
[1090.42 --> 1092.00]  don't do that, he didn't.
[1093.66 --> 1095.26]  He lived it.
[1095.32 --> 1096.28]  Not perfectly.
[1097.40 --> 1098.38]  Throughout his life.
[1099.62 --> 1103.02]  He had a long walk with this Lord.
[1103.60 --> 1104.90]  And it had shaped him.
[1108.22 --> 1112.44]  I have words to say to my grandkids.
[1112.58 --> 1114.18]  And they probably say too many words.
[1115.30 --> 1116.60]  That's not a surprise.
[1117.82 --> 1119.20]  I have a lot to say.
[1120.58 --> 1121.56]  But you know what?
[1121.56 --> 1125.32]  I really hope my life speaks to them.
[1126.92 --> 1128.90]  Mistakes and all.
[1132.52 --> 1134.20]  You know, the Spirit of the Lord
[1134.20 --> 1135.66]  was upon Simeon.
[1136.60 --> 1137.90]  And I hope the Spirit of the Lord
[1137.90 --> 1139.16]  is upon me in such a way
[1139.16 --> 1141.24]  that it's evident to my children
[1141.24 --> 1141.84]  and grandchildren.
[1142.88 --> 1144.26]  Simeon's life was guided
[1144.26 --> 1145.74]  by God's Spirit.
[1147.04 --> 1148.32]  And then there's Anna.
[1148.92 --> 1149.94]  She's called a prophet.
[1149.94 --> 1151.00]  It basically means
[1151.00 --> 1152.56]  someone who speaks God's words.
[1153.68 --> 1154.70]  She's in her 80s.
[1155.66 --> 1157.48]  She had known deep pain.
[1158.26 --> 1159.14]  She had lost her husband.
[1159.28 --> 1160.42]  And yet she walked with the Lord
[1160.42 --> 1161.58]  in spite of all of that.
[1163.24 --> 1164.88]  She'd been a widow for a long time.
[1166.22 --> 1168.62]  And yet she found deep contentedness
[1168.62 --> 1169.66]  in God.
[1169.84 --> 1171.04]  Even though her life
[1171.04 --> 1173.38]  wasn't exactly as she wished it to be.
[1173.38 --> 1175.76]  And it says she was fasting
[1175.76 --> 1176.56]  and praying
[1176.56 --> 1178.42]  and sharing her faith.
[1181.30 --> 1182.14]  She made me,
[1182.94 --> 1184.14]  as I reflected on her,
[1184.56 --> 1186.70]  she made me think of my mom.
[1188.00 --> 1189.80]  My mom is turning 90
[1189.80 --> 1191.24]  at the end of December.
[1192.82 --> 1193.58]  The other day,
[1193.82 --> 1195.14]  I had a whip home
[1195.14 --> 1196.00]  from the church office.
[1196.22 --> 1197.10]  And when I got home,
[1197.16 --> 1198.90]  there was a Christmas card
[1198.90 --> 1200.36]  in my mailbox.
[1200.36 --> 1201.76]  And it was from my mom.
[1202.14 --> 1202.96]  I know you need to know
[1202.96 --> 1205.64]  my mom has dementia.
[1206.82 --> 1207.46]  So, you know,
[1207.52 --> 1208.52]  getting a Christmas card,
[1208.60 --> 1209.94]  I knew she didn't send it.
[1210.56 --> 1211.90]  But she did sign it.
[1212.78 --> 1214.04]  So I thought I'd give her a call.
[1214.38 --> 1216.48]  And I knew by giving her a call,
[1216.54 --> 1217.78]  I would be informing her
[1217.78 --> 1218.82]  that she wrote us a card.
[1218.82 --> 1222.30]  And that indeed was the case.
[1222.94 --> 1223.90]  But it was so nice
[1223.90 --> 1224.76]  to talk to her.
[1225.00 --> 1225.94]  And my mom,
[1226.78 --> 1227.04]  you know,
[1227.08 --> 1228.18]  she just talked about
[1228.18 --> 1229.64]  how content she feels
[1229.64 --> 1230.12]  in the Lord.
[1236.12 --> 1237.28]  And I haven't seen her
[1237.28 --> 1238.68]  since March.
[1238.68 --> 1245.40]  And I'm grateful
[1245.40 --> 1246.14]  for her dementia
[1246.14 --> 1246.72]  in the sense that
[1246.72 --> 1247.44]  she doesn't remember
[1247.44 --> 1248.92]  how little she's being visited.
[1250.64 --> 1252.00]  But her contentedness
[1252.00 --> 1252.50]  moved me.
[1252.66 --> 1253.12]  And to me,
[1253.20 --> 1253.84]  in that moment,
[1254.92 --> 1256.18]  she was a prophet.
[1257.52 --> 1258.50]  And we were on the phone
[1258.50 --> 1259.84]  and she started to sing
[1259.84 --> 1260.96]  this old Dutch hymn.
[1262.24 --> 1264.28]  And speaking of
[1264.28 --> 1265.46]  God's faithfulness.
[1265.46 --> 1267.90]  And she didn't know
[1267.90 --> 1269.00]  but she was being a prophet
[1269.00 --> 1269.78]  to her son.
[1272.70 --> 1273.84]  With her very life
[1273.84 --> 1274.66]  and her very words.
[1274.76 --> 1275.10]  And this old,
[1275.64 --> 1277.34]  we had the place
[1277.34 --> 1278.12]  where she's staying
[1278.12 --> 1282.70]  and send us a clip
[1282.70 --> 1284.54]  of her singing another song.
[1285.06 --> 1285.94]  And there's this old lady
[1285.94 --> 1287.12]  and they had come to her room
[1287.12 --> 1288.06]  with a guitar
[1288.06 --> 1289.00]  and a couple of staff.
[1289.54 --> 1290.46]  And they were singing
[1290.46 --> 1291.74]  Christmas carols with her.
[1292.74 --> 1294.32]  And there's this little clip.
[1294.40 --> 1295.44]  I probably should have played it.
[1295.46 --> 1296.46]  because it's a beautiful thing
[1296.46 --> 1297.44]  to see this little old lady
[1297.44 --> 1298.92]  singing away in a manger.
[1300.20 --> 1301.56]  And she finishes the song
[1301.56 --> 1302.02]  and she says,
[1302.62 --> 1304.24]  that's a beautiful story.
[1306.18 --> 1306.90]  It is.
[1309.04 --> 1310.30]  Everybody has a story.
[1312.30 --> 1314.46]  I'm drawn to those people
[1314.46 --> 1315.42]  in my life
[1315.42 --> 1317.28]  who have experienced hardship
[1317.28 --> 1319.56]  and have somehow learned
[1319.56 --> 1320.46]  to live with it
[1320.46 --> 1321.76]  and in fact grow with it.
[1321.76 --> 1325.16]  There's a lot of people
[1325.16 --> 1325.76]  who are victimized
[1326.64 --> 1327.44]  by their pain
[1327.44 --> 1329.62]  and remain victims.
[1330.86 --> 1331.96]  While some grow
[1331.96 --> 1333.08]  in profound ways
[1333.08 --> 1334.64]  because of the pain
[1334.64 --> 1336.06]  and God's work through it.
[1336.90 --> 1338.22]  Anna is not one
[1338.22 --> 1339.32]  who's looking for pity.
[1339.70 --> 1341.04]  She's looking for that
[1341.04 --> 1342.62]  deeper walk with the Lord
[1342.62 --> 1344.34]  in spite of her pain
[1344.34 --> 1345.94]  and in her history.
[1346.26 --> 1347.72]  And she allows God
[1347.72 --> 1349.22]  to enter her space,
[1349.48 --> 1350.08]  that pain,
[1350.08 --> 1350.64]  in that life.
[1350.64 --> 1352.06]  And she is transformed
[1352.06 --> 1353.20]  by it.
[1355.56 --> 1356.70]  And that happens
[1356.70 --> 1357.80]  over time.
[1359.38 --> 1360.94]  That's not a one day event.
[1361.94 --> 1363.06]  Learning to walk
[1363.06 --> 1363.66]  with the Lord.
[1364.96 --> 1365.22]  You know,
[1365.26 --> 1365.86]  we can spend
[1365.86 --> 1366.70]  our entire lives
[1366.70 --> 1367.94]  worrying and fretting
[1367.94 --> 1368.80]  over what isn't.
[1369.72 --> 1370.44]  Or we can learn
[1370.44 --> 1371.56]  to find God's presence
[1371.56 --> 1373.14]  in every space
[1373.14 --> 1374.26]  including the dark ones.
[1374.26 --> 1376.90]  And those who have learned
[1376.90 --> 1377.66]  to find God
[1377.66 --> 1378.32]  in their pain
[1378.32 --> 1380.48]  develop a deep perspective
[1380.48 --> 1381.12]  on life.
[1383.88 --> 1385.38]  These people tend not
[1385.38 --> 1386.60]  to sweat the small stuff
[1386.60 --> 1386.98]  anymore.
[1388.04 --> 1388.88]  They just know
[1388.88 --> 1389.76]  the Lord is with them.
[1391.40 --> 1391.88]  And Anna,
[1391.98 --> 1392.56]  because of this,
[1392.62 --> 1393.58]  has much to say
[1393.58 --> 1394.86]  that's worth hearing.
[1396.46 --> 1397.48]  And there's so much
[1397.48 --> 1398.60]  to copy in terms
[1398.60 --> 1399.96]  of the way she lives life
[1399.96 --> 1401.08]  with this fasting
[1401.08 --> 1401.72]  and praying.
[1401.72 --> 1403.46]  And I think
[1403.46 --> 1404.50]  I see her as being
[1404.50 --> 1406.12]  a word that is important
[1406.12 --> 1406.78]  to me right now
[1406.78 --> 1407.84]  is mindfulness.
[1409.04 --> 1410.30]  Being in the moment
[1410.30 --> 1411.64]  daily with God
[1411.64 --> 1412.46]  no matter what
[1412.46 --> 1413.66]  the day holds.
[1414.62 --> 1415.92]  Knowing that God
[1415.92 --> 1416.86]  is right there
[1416.86 --> 1417.88]  in every moment
[1417.88 --> 1419.42]  no matter what's happening.
[1420.72 --> 1422.28]  That is what prayer
[1422.28 --> 1423.54]  and scripture reading
[1423.54 --> 1424.28]  and fasting
[1424.28 --> 1425.28]  and times of violence,
[1425.28 --> 1427.42]  that's what they do.
[1428.94 --> 1430.50]  They keep you focused.
[1430.70 --> 1431.80]  They keep you grounded
[1431.80 --> 1432.58]  in the reality
[1432.58 --> 1434.66]  of God with us
[1434.66 --> 1436.18]  in every second
[1436.18 --> 1436.90]  of our lives
[1436.90 --> 1439.00]  regardless of circumstances.
[1442.42 --> 1443.48]  Anna and Simeon
[1443.48 --> 1445.30]  made this faith
[1445.30 --> 1446.62]  of theirs
[1446.62 --> 1447.94]  a way of life.
[1448.10 --> 1448.62]  And so then
[1448.62 --> 1449.72]  they had eyes
[1449.72 --> 1450.48]  to see
[1450.48 --> 1451.64]  that Christ
[1451.64 --> 1452.58]  had come.
[1452.58 --> 1455.52]  I mean it struck me
[1455.52 --> 1456.52]  here's these two
[1456.52 --> 1457.52]  old people
[1457.52 --> 1458.46]  I mean
[1458.46 --> 1459.78]  very likely
[1459.78 --> 1460.94]  needing reading glasses.
[1462.78 --> 1464.40]  And they're the ones
[1464.40 --> 1465.58]  who see Christ.
[1466.40 --> 1468.06]  He's just a baby.
[1469.80 --> 1471.36]  Everybody else is there.
[1472.28 --> 1473.34]  How come these two
[1473.34 --> 1474.36]  senior citizens
[1474.36 --> 1475.52]  see the Christ?
[1476.56 --> 1476.92]  And I know
[1476.92 --> 1477.38]  it's the work
[1477.38 --> 1478.12]  of the Holy Spirit
[1478.12 --> 1480.04]  but when Jesus says
[1480.04 --> 1481.22]  may they have eyes
[1481.22 --> 1481.74]  to see
[1481.74 --> 1482.88]  and ears to hear
[1482.88 --> 1483.68]  there's something
[1483.68 --> 1484.66]  going on there.
[1488.28 --> 1489.42]  Let me ask you
[1489.42 --> 1492.18]  are you training
[1492.18 --> 1493.20]  your eyes
[1493.20 --> 1494.36]  to see Christ
[1494.36 --> 1495.52]  entering your life
[1495.52 --> 1496.48]  all the time
[1496.48 --> 1497.60]  even in those
[1497.60 --> 1498.56]  dark spaces?
[1500.22 --> 1501.12]  Are you living
[1501.12 --> 1502.16]  mindful of
[1502.16 --> 1503.32]  his daily presence?
[1504.76 --> 1505.88]  Because Christ
[1505.88 --> 1507.64]  keeps coming.
[1508.12 --> 1511.02]  every single day
[1511.02 --> 1512.30]  is Christmas
[1512.30 --> 1515.50]  in a sense.
[1517.82 --> 1519.00]  We read here
[1519.00 --> 1521.78]  in verse 22
[1521.78 --> 1523.72]  through 23 there
[1523.72 --> 1526.40]  about
[1526.40 --> 1528.08]  purification rights
[1528.08 --> 1528.70]  and the law
[1528.70 --> 1530.02]  and that Mary
[1530.02 --> 1530.34]  and Joseph
[1530.34 --> 1530.84]  had come
[1530.84 --> 1532.00]  to present
[1532.00 --> 1532.42]  Jesus
[1532.42 --> 1533.88]  and Mary
[1533.88 --> 1534.36]  as well
[1534.36 --> 1535.30]  to be purified.
[1535.88 --> 1536.90]  There's this whole thing
[1536.90 --> 1537.54]  in the Old Testament
[1537.54 --> 1538.60]  demanding
[1538.60 --> 1539.66]  that 40 days
[1539.66 --> 1539.94]  old
[1539.94 --> 1541.10]  the child
[1541.10 --> 1541.78]  would be presented
[1541.78 --> 1542.16]  especially
[1542.16 --> 1543.02]  a firstborn son
[1543.02 --> 1545.00]  and the woman
[1545.00 --> 1546.22]  is to be purified
[1546.22 --> 1546.80]  according to
[1546.80 --> 1547.28]  the Old Testament
[1547.28 --> 1547.64]  law
[1547.64 --> 1548.76]  so she can again
[1548.76 --> 1549.62]  worship in the temple.
[1550.94 --> 1551.66]  The sacrifice
[1551.66 --> 1552.00]  that
[1552.00 --> 1553.54]  if you had some money
[1553.54 --> 1554.94]  you would give
[1554.94 --> 1555.56]  would be a ram
[1555.56 --> 1557.00]  but if you were poor
[1557.00 --> 1557.58]  you could give
[1557.58 --> 1558.64]  a couple of doves
[1558.64 --> 1559.34]  and it says here
[1559.34 --> 1559.76]  that's what Mary
[1559.76 --> 1560.54]  and Joseph gave
[1560.54 --> 1561.96]  reminding us
[1561.96 --> 1562.38]  that Jesus
[1562.38 --> 1562.84]  comes from
[1562.84 --> 1563.44]  a poor family.
[1563.44 --> 1566.30]  and then I see
[1566.30 --> 1567.22]  you picture Simeon
[1567.22 --> 1567.98]  this old man
[1567.98 --> 1569.84]  and he's walking
[1569.84 --> 1570.52]  up to Mary
[1570.52 --> 1570.76]  and Joseph
[1570.76 --> 1571.14]  they don't know
[1571.14 --> 1571.58]  who he is
[1571.58 --> 1572.42]  this old man
[1572.42 --> 1572.96]  comes up to him
[1572.96 --> 1573.26]  and says here
[1573.26 --> 1573.56]  let me hold
[1573.56 --> 1574.04]  your baby
[1574.04 --> 1575.70]  and I picture
[1575.70 --> 1576.68]  some nervousness
[1576.68 --> 1577.64]  because some old guy
[1577.64 --> 1578.40]  you know
[1578.40 --> 1580.08]  maybe he's a little shaky
[1580.08 --> 1582.60]  and he takes
[1582.60 --> 1583.40]  this baby
[1583.40 --> 1587.44]  made me think of
[1587.44 --> 1588.88]  I've had the privilege
[1588.88 --> 1591.18]  of baptizing
[1591.18 --> 1591.92]  my grandkids
[1591.92 --> 1595.14]  my first
[1595.14 --> 1596.86]  born grandson
[1596.86 --> 1597.70]  is here
[1597.70 --> 1598.76]  he was playing
[1598.76 --> 1599.34]  drums today
[1599.34 --> 1600.74]  I can still picture
[1600.74 --> 1602.82]  holding him
[1602.82 --> 1604.40]  and baptizing him
[1604.40 --> 1605.62]  and what a privilege
[1605.62 --> 1606.30]  that was
[1606.30 --> 1607.88]  to bless
[1607.88 --> 1608.82]  the next generation
[1608.82 --> 1609.82]  and I see Simeon
[1609.82 --> 1610.98]  this old man
[1610.98 --> 1611.84]  holding this baby
[1611.84 --> 1613.74]  and he realizes
[1613.74 --> 1614.58]  what Simeon
[1614.58 --> 1614.98]  strikes
[1614.98 --> 1615.98]  what strikes Simeon
[1615.98 --> 1617.20]  and let me read
[1617.20 --> 1618.14]  the words that he said
[1618.14 --> 1618.64]  because I think
[1618.64 --> 1619.56]  they're profound
[1619.56 --> 1622.82]  in verse 29 here
[1622.82 --> 1625.08]  sovereign Lord
[1625.08 --> 1626.04]  as you have promised
[1626.04 --> 1627.22]  you may now dismiss
[1627.22 --> 1628.66]  your servant in peace
[1628.66 --> 1629.88]  right
[1629.88 --> 1631.00]  I'm ready to die
[1631.00 --> 1632.42]  for my eyes
[1632.42 --> 1633.56]  have seen your salvation
[1633.56 --> 1634.40]  which you have prepared
[1634.40 --> 1635.48]  in the sight of all the nations
[1635.48 --> 1636.30]  the light of revelation
[1636.30 --> 1636.98]  to the Gentiles
[1636.98 --> 1638.16]  and the glory of your people
[1638.16 --> 1638.52]  Israel
[1638.52 --> 1639.94]  and then the father
[1639.94 --> 1640.52]  and mother
[1640.52 --> 1641.60]  you know
[1641.60 --> 1643.68]  are amazed
[1643.68 --> 1646.18]  Simeon realizes
[1646.18 --> 1646.96]  that only Jesus
[1646.96 --> 1649.46]  can meet his deepest longings
[1649.46 --> 1651.26]  only Jesus
[1651.26 --> 1653.42]  is the real purification
[1653.42 --> 1654.74]  not the lambs
[1654.74 --> 1655.72]  not the doves
[1655.72 --> 1657.20]  but this lamb of God
[1657.20 --> 1658.56]  is the real purification
[1658.56 --> 1659.64]  somehow he knows this
[1659.64 --> 1660.98]  and the longings
[1660.98 --> 1661.86]  of your heart
[1661.86 --> 1663.96]  can only be satisfied
[1663.96 --> 1665.12]  your deepest longings
[1665.12 --> 1666.40]  can only be satisfied
[1666.40 --> 1667.12]  in Christ
[1667.12 --> 1673.70]  you can wait
[1673.70 --> 1675.34]  for your intellect
[1675.34 --> 1676.62]  to bring you
[1676.62 --> 1677.14]  what you think
[1677.14 --> 1678.10]  you must need
[1678.10 --> 1679.18]  you can wait
[1679.18 --> 1679.92]  for your money
[1679.92 --> 1680.78]  to meet your need
[1680.78 --> 1681.46]  you can wait
[1681.46 --> 1682.14]  for your status
[1682.14 --> 1682.86]  you can wait
[1682.86 --> 1683.50]  for your power
[1683.50 --> 1684.10]  you can wait
[1684.10 --> 1685.12]  for whatever you want
[1685.12 --> 1686.06]  but you
[1686.06 --> 1687.18]  will wait
[1687.18 --> 1687.90]  in vain
[1687.90 --> 1689.86]  because only
[1689.86 --> 1690.48]  Jesus
[1690.48 --> 1691.46]  can bring you
[1691.46 --> 1692.46]  what you most
[1692.46 --> 1693.66]  deeply need
[1693.66 --> 1694.76]  and Simeon
[1694.76 --> 1695.34]  knew this
[1695.34 --> 1696.46]  and Anna knew this
[1696.46 --> 1697.72]  they had waited
[1697.72 --> 1698.92]  for Jesus
[1698.92 --> 1703.00]  because
[1703.00 --> 1704.20]  he saves
[1704.20 --> 1705.74]  and he redeems
[1705.74 --> 1707.10]  and he restores
[1707.10 --> 1708.48]  and he heals
[1708.48 --> 1713.08]  C.S. Lewis writes
[1713.08 --> 1714.78]  alas the door
[1714.78 --> 1715.64]  that we've been knocking
[1715.64 --> 1716.72]  on our whole lives
[1716.72 --> 1717.54]  is now open
[1717.54 --> 1720.46]  and Simeon says
[1720.46 --> 1721.22]  now
[1721.22 --> 1722.76]  I can die
[1722.76 --> 1724.36]  truly satisfied
[1724.36 --> 1727.96]  my mom spoke
[1727.96 --> 1728.66]  of being ready
[1728.66 --> 1728.98]  that
[1728.98 --> 1730.74]  she dies soon
[1730.74 --> 1731.70]  she's good
[1731.70 --> 1732.28]  with that
[1732.28 --> 1734.26]  she's happy
[1734.26 --> 1734.78]  to be alive
[1734.78 --> 1735.32]  but she's good
[1735.32 --> 1735.80]  with dying
[1735.80 --> 1737.66]  she knows
[1737.66 --> 1738.44]  where she goes
[1738.44 --> 1740.92]  she knows
[1740.92 --> 1741.90]  that her satisfaction
[1741.90 --> 1742.62]  and her life
[1742.62 --> 1743.44]  are found in Christ
[1743.44 --> 1744.66]  and this
[1744.66 --> 1745.50]  good news
[1745.50 --> 1746.44]  is this gospel
[1746.44 --> 1747.80]  is for all people
[1747.80 --> 1749.46]  for all outcasts
[1749.46 --> 1750.22]  for Jews
[1750.22 --> 1751.34]  for Gentiles
[1751.34 --> 1753.44]  we read here
[1753.44 --> 1754.10]  of the light
[1754.10 --> 1755.02]  and the glory
[1755.02 --> 1755.60]  for people
[1755.60 --> 1756.58]  I've been trying
[1756.58 --> 1757.36]  to reflect a little bit
[1757.36 --> 1757.98]  on that light
[1757.98 --> 1758.42]  and glory
[1758.42 --> 1758.68]  I think
[1758.68 --> 1759.66]  when you have light
[1759.66 --> 1760.82]  and the light of Jesus
[1760.82 --> 1761.34]  in your life
[1761.34 --> 1762.44]  somehow then glory
[1762.44 --> 1763.44]  is also shown
[1763.44 --> 1769.08]  and he says
[1769.08 --> 1769.70]  he says
[1769.70 --> 1770.32]  to Mary
[1770.32 --> 1772.42]  who has seen
[1772.42 --> 1773.54]  and heard the angels
[1773.54 --> 1774.54]  who has seen
[1774.54 --> 1776.06]  what the shepherds
[1776.06 --> 1776.74]  had done
[1776.74 --> 1777.28]  and said
[1777.28 --> 1778.44]  and she's been
[1778.44 --> 1779.14]  pondering
[1779.14 --> 1779.72]  scripture says
[1779.72 --> 1780.48]  she's been pondering
[1780.48 --> 1780.94]  all these things
[1780.94 --> 1781.36]  in her heart
[1781.36 --> 1783.40]  and she hears
[1783.40 --> 1784.44]  these words
[1784.44 --> 1786.18]  where Simeon
[1786.18 --> 1786.86]  blessed them
[1786.86 --> 1787.60]  and then said
[1787.60 --> 1788.04]  to Mary
[1788.04 --> 1789.14]  this child
[1789.14 --> 1789.80]  is destined
[1789.80 --> 1790.46]  to cause
[1790.46 --> 1791.04]  the rising
[1791.04 --> 1791.60]  and the falling
[1791.60 --> 1792.34]  of many in Israel
[1792.34 --> 1793.38]  to be a sign
[1793.38 --> 1794.10]  that will be spoken
[1794.10 --> 1794.42]  again
[1794.42 --> 1795.48]  so that the hearts
[1795.48 --> 1795.92]  of many
[1795.92 --> 1796.86]  will be revealed
[1796.86 --> 1797.96]  and a sword
[1797.96 --> 1798.64]  will pierce
[1798.64 --> 1799.32]  your own soul
[1799.32 --> 1799.76]  too
[1799.76 --> 1804.92]  many
[1804.92 --> 1806.64]  will rise
[1806.64 --> 1807.46]  because of him
[1807.46 --> 1809.20]  the outcast
[1809.20 --> 1810.88]  the broken
[1810.88 --> 1812.72]  the hurting
[1812.72 --> 1814.64]  those
[1814.64 --> 1815.44]  who know
[1815.44 --> 1816.30]  their poverty
[1816.30 --> 1818.12]  those who know
[1818.12 --> 1819.10]  their inadequacy
[1819.10 --> 1821.62]  but many
[1821.62 --> 1823.10]  will fall
[1823.10 --> 1823.80]  because of him
[1823.80 --> 1824.28]  and why
[1824.28 --> 1826.64]  because they choose
[1826.64 --> 1827.72]  self-sufficiency
[1827.72 --> 1828.76]  over salvation
[1828.76 --> 1829.98]  over being
[1829.98 --> 1831.06]  rescued
[1831.06 --> 1834.70]  it's a humbling
[1834.70 --> 1835.22]  thing
[1835.22 --> 1836.64]  to admit
[1836.64 --> 1837.66]  you need
[1837.66 --> 1838.30]  rescue
[1838.30 --> 1841.40]  and so Simeon
[1841.40 --> 1841.60]  said
[1841.60 --> 1842.00]  yeah Mary
[1842.00 --> 1842.62]  there's some
[1842.62 --> 1843.40]  pain ahead
[1843.40 --> 1844.62]  but wait
[1844.62 --> 1845.78]  because salvation
[1845.78 --> 1846.46]  has come
[1846.46 --> 1847.56]  through your son
[1847.56 --> 1849.62]  and then Jesus
[1849.62 --> 1850.14]  comes
[1850.14 --> 1850.90]  and he shines
[1850.90 --> 1851.46]  light
[1851.46 --> 1852.26]  in dark
[1852.26 --> 1852.92]  places
[1852.92 --> 1856.40]  that's not
[1856.40 --> 1856.96]  an easy
[1856.96 --> 1857.32]  thing
[1857.32 --> 1857.78]  for those
[1857.78 --> 1858.04]  of us
[1858.04 --> 1858.44]  who don't
[1858.44 --> 1858.74]  want to
[1858.74 --> 1859.24]  look in
[1859.24 --> 1859.78]  that dark
[1859.78 --> 1860.26]  place
[1860.26 --> 1862.44]  it is a
[1862.44 --> 1862.74]  light
[1862.74 --> 1863.78]  that demands
[1863.78 --> 1864.42]  honesty
[1864.42 --> 1865.20]  but promises
[1865.20 --> 1865.80]  healing
[1865.80 --> 1867.68]  Jesus
[1867.68 --> 1868.38]  comes
[1868.38 --> 1869.18]  and he
[1869.18 --> 1869.82]  enters
[1869.82 --> 1870.94]  it all
[1870.94 --> 1873.68]  and those
[1873.68 --> 1874.12]  who are saying
[1874.12 --> 1874.34]  well
[1874.34 --> 1874.88]  no
[1874.88 --> 1875.76]  Jesus
[1875.76 --> 1876.36]  can't come
[1876.36 --> 1877.02]  into this
[1877.02 --> 1877.46]  place
[1877.46 --> 1877.98]  Jesus
[1877.98 --> 1878.42]  can't
[1878.42 --> 1878.70]  actually
[1878.70 --> 1879.16]  enter
[1879.16 --> 1879.72]  this
[1879.72 --> 1880.18]  pain
[1880.18 --> 1880.84]  can't
[1880.84 --> 1881.04]  enter
[1881.04 --> 1881.52]  this
[1881.52 --> 1881.92]  part
[1881.92 --> 1882.22]  of my
[1882.22 --> 1882.72]  story
[1882.72 --> 1885.06]  I say
[1885.06 --> 1885.52]  to them
[1885.52 --> 1886.06]  actually
[1886.06 --> 1886.64]  he can
[1886.64 --> 1886.96]  and he
[1886.96 --> 1887.32]  must
[1887.32 --> 1887.96]  so that
[1887.96 --> 1888.36]  you will
[1888.36 --> 1888.56]  know
[1888.56 --> 1888.92]  life
[1888.92 --> 1889.18]  and all
[1889.18 --> 1889.34]  its
[1889.34 --> 1889.72]  fullness
[1889.72 --> 1891.16]  joy
[1891.16 --> 1891.72]  comes
[1891.72 --> 1893.54]  that's
[1893.54 --> 1893.80]  why I
[1893.80 --> 1893.98]  love
[1893.98 --> 1894.38]  the way
[1894.38 --> 1894.82]  Eugene
[1894.82 --> 1895.28]  Peterson
[1895.28 --> 1895.60]  in
[1895.60 --> 1896.60]  John's
[1896.60 --> 1896.86]  gospel
[1896.86 --> 1897.54]  when he
[1897.54 --> 1897.76]  talks
[1897.76 --> 1897.94]  about
[1897.94 --> 1898.12]  Jesus
[1898.12 --> 1898.34]  coming
[1898.34 --> 1898.48]  he
[1898.48 --> 1898.60]  said
[1898.60 --> 1898.78]  the
[1898.78 --> 1899.18]  word
[1899.18 --> 1899.64]  became
[1899.64 --> 1900.06]  flesh
[1900.06 --> 1900.22]  and
[1900.22 --> 1900.38]  moved
[1900.38 --> 1900.58]  into
[1900.58 --> 1900.78]  the
[1900.78 --> 1901.16]  neighborhood
[1901.16 --> 1902.80]  yeah
[1902.80 --> 1903.18]  and not
[1903.18 --> 1903.48]  just
[1903.48 --> 1903.74]  the
[1903.74 --> 1904.10]  comfy
[1904.10 --> 1904.50]  parts
[1904.50 --> 1904.72]  of the
[1904.72 --> 1905.00]  neighborhood
[1905.00 --> 1905.50]  every
[1905.50 --> 1905.96]  corner
[1905.96 --> 1906.32]  of the
[1906.32 --> 1906.70]  neighborhood
[1906.70 --> 1909.18]  the part
[1909.18 --> 1909.38]  of the
[1909.38 --> 1909.68]  neighborhood
[1909.68 --> 1910.02]  that you
[1910.02 --> 1910.36]  avoid
[1910.36 --> 1913.06]  that house
[1913.06 --> 1914.08]  where there's
[1914.08 --> 1914.54]  lots of
[1914.54 --> 1914.96]  problems
[1914.96 --> 1915.20]  yet he
[1915.20 --> 1915.48]  comes
[1915.48 --> 1915.66]  there
[1915.66 --> 1915.90]  too
[1915.90 --> 1916.66]  and here's
[1916.66 --> 1917.14]  the irony
[1917.14 --> 1917.44]  of it
[1917.44 --> 1917.68]  all
[1917.68 --> 1919.10]  then joy
[1919.10 --> 1919.78]  comes
[1919.78 --> 1924.60]  I love
[1924.60 --> 1924.82]  this
[1924.82 --> 1926.48]  psalm
[1926.48 --> 1927.02]  in psalm
[1927.02 --> 1927.30]  30
[1927.30 --> 1928.06]  verse 5
[1928.06 --> 1929.90]  where the
[1929.90 --> 1930.20]  psalmist
[1930.20 --> 1930.52]  writes
[1930.52 --> 1931.54]  his anger
[1931.54 --> 1933.02]  lasts only a
[1933.02 --> 1933.42]  moment but
[1933.42 --> 1934.32]  his favor
[1934.32 --> 1934.90]  lasts a
[1934.90 --> 1935.20]  lifetime
[1935.20 --> 1935.50]  and then
[1935.50 --> 1935.74]  this
[1935.74 --> 1936.58]  weeping
[1936.58 --> 1937.20]  may last
[1937.20 --> 1937.52]  through the
[1937.52 --> 1937.68]  night
[1937.68 --> 1937.98]  yeah you
[1937.98 --> 1938.36]  go through
[1938.36 --> 1938.72]  this hard
[1938.72 --> 1938.92]  time
[1938.92 --> 1939.32]  weeping
[1939.32 --> 1939.72]  may last
[1939.72 --> 1939.92]  night
[1939.92 --> 1940.66]  but joy
[1940.66 --> 1941.10]  comes
[1941.10 --> 1941.60]  with the
[1941.60 --> 1941.96]  morning
[1941.96 --> 1943.76]  with the
[1943.76 --> 1944.12]  coming of
[1944.12 --> 1944.28]  our
[1944.28 --> 1944.56]  Savior
[1944.56 --> 1949.12]  and then
[1949.12 --> 1949.72]  Anna speaks
[1949.72 --> 1951.34]  she gives
[1951.34 --> 1951.78]  thanks
[1951.78 --> 1954.00]  and she
[1954.00 --> 1954.72]  shares with
[1954.72 --> 1955.16]  all who are
[1955.16 --> 1955.66]  waiting for
[1955.66 --> 1956.08]  redemption
[1956.08 --> 1958.50]  it's interesting
[1958.50 --> 1959.14]  that you know
[1959.14 --> 1959.64]  you may as well
[1959.64 --> 1960.20]  not share with
[1960.20 --> 1960.62]  those who don't
[1960.62 --> 1961.20]  want redemption
[1961.20 --> 1962.06]  you can try
[1962.06 --> 1963.08]  but somehow
[1963.08 --> 1963.62]  when you know
[1963.62 --> 1963.94]  you need
[1963.94 --> 1964.28]  redemption
[1964.28 --> 1964.72]  you're willing
[1964.72 --> 1965.10]  to hear
[1965.10 --> 1968.32]  let's be
[1968.32 --> 1969.16]  aware of
[1969.16 --> 1969.70]  those folks
[1969.70 --> 1970.28]  around us
[1970.28 --> 1970.56]  who are
[1970.56 --> 1971.22]  longing and
[1971.22 --> 1971.76]  waiting for
[1971.76 --> 1972.14]  more
[1972.14 --> 1976.72]  I remember
[1976.72 --> 1979.60]  the fall
[1979.60 --> 1979.82]  of the
[1979.82 --> 1980.38]  Berlin Wall
[1980.38 --> 1980.64]  I know
[1980.64 --> 1981.08]  that ages
[1981.08 --> 1981.32]  me
[1981.32 --> 1982.82]  I did
[1982.82 --> 1983.28]  the math
[1983.28 --> 1983.52]  it's
[1983.52 --> 1984.52]  30 years
[1984.52 --> 1984.72]  ago
[1984.72 --> 1985.04]  so
[1985.04 --> 1986.54]  Dave
[1986.54 --> 1987.10]  was probably
[1987.10 --> 1987.50]  like
[1987.50 --> 1987.92]  three
[1987.92 --> 1990.76]  it was a
[1990.76 --> 1991.22]  significant
[1991.22 --> 1991.56]  event
[1991.56 --> 1992.02]  the falling
[1992.02 --> 1992.32]  of the
[1992.32 --> 1993.02]  Berlin Wall
[1993.02 --> 1995.14]  wall
[1995.14 --> 1995.92]  that divided
[1995.92 --> 1996.58]  east and
[1996.58 --> 1996.88]  west
[1996.88 --> 1997.44]  Germany
[1997.44 --> 1998.66]  the free
[1998.66 --> 1999.00]  west
[1999.00 --> 1999.38]  from the
[1999.38 --> 1999.78]  oppression
[1999.78 --> 2000.64]  of communism
[2000.64 --> 2001.96]  and the
[2001.96 --> 2002.44]  people in
[2002.44 --> 2003.18]  east Berlin
[2003.18 --> 2003.88]  and east
[2003.88 --> 2004.12]  Germany
[2004.12 --> 2004.84]  were in
[2004.84 --> 2005.12]  essence
[2005.12 --> 2005.78]  locked in
[2005.78 --> 2007.34]  and there
[2007.34 --> 2007.64]  had been
[2007.64 --> 2008.24]  protests
[2008.24 --> 2009.02]  starting up
[2009.02 --> 2010.96]  in the
[2010.96 --> 2012.50]  eastern part
[2012.50 --> 2013.46]  where protests
[2013.46 --> 2014.08]  weren't allowed
[2014.08 --> 2017.04]  the protests
[2017.04 --> 2017.74]  began around
[2017.74 --> 2018.80]  Saint Nicholas's
[2018.80 --> 2019.30]  church
[2019.30 --> 2021.70]  a bunch of
[2021.70 --> 2022.18]  people would
[2022.18 --> 2022.62]  gather
[2022.62 --> 2023.70]  and at first
[2023.70 --> 2024.04]  the numbers
[2024.04 --> 2024.58]  were relatively
[2024.58 --> 2024.92]  small
[2024.92 --> 2025.26]  around a
[2025.26 --> 2025.92]  thousand or so
[2025.92 --> 2026.64]  eventually
[2026.64 --> 2027.26]  those numbers
[2027.26 --> 2027.80]  grew to
[2027.80 --> 2029.28]  300,000
[2029.28 --> 2030.02]  people
[2030.02 --> 2031.50]  singing songs
[2031.50 --> 2032.10]  of hope
[2032.10 --> 2033.18]  and protest
[2033.18 --> 2034.10]  and justice
[2034.10 --> 2037.08]  until their
[2037.08 --> 2037.58]  songs
[2037.58 --> 2038.62]  shook the
[2038.62 --> 2039.10]  power of
[2039.10 --> 2039.58]  the nation
[2039.58 --> 2040.98]  and changed
[2040.98 --> 2041.48]  the world
[2041.48 --> 2044.30]  sometime
[2044.30 --> 2044.94]  after the
[2044.94 --> 2045.32]  fall of the
[2045.32 --> 2045.54]  wall
[2045.54 --> 2046.68]  and those
[2046.68 --> 2046.82]  of you
[2046.82 --> 2046.96]  who don't
[2046.96 --> 2047.22]  know the
[2047.22 --> 2047.74]  story well
[2047.74 --> 2049.34]  look it up
[2049.34 --> 2049.82]  the fall of
[2049.82 --> 2050.24]  the Berlin Wall
[2050.24 --> 2050.86]  it was an
[2050.86 --> 2051.68]  amazing time
[2051.68 --> 2053.18]  massive
[2053.18 --> 2053.90]  change in
[2053.90 --> 2054.30]  history
[2054.30 --> 2055.10]  sometime
[2055.10 --> 2055.96]  after the
[2055.96 --> 2056.34]  fall of the
[2056.34 --> 2056.52]  wall
[2056.52 --> 2057.08]  a journalist
[2057.08 --> 2057.60]  asked
[2057.60 --> 2058.32]  one of the
[2058.32 --> 2059.04]  commanders
[2059.04 --> 2059.42]  of the
[2059.42 --> 2060.18]  East German
[2060.18 --> 2061.36]  secret police
[2061.36 --> 2063.22]  why haven't
[2063.22 --> 2063.82]  they simply
[2063.82 --> 2064.54]  crushed
[2064.54 --> 2065.52]  these protests
[2065.52 --> 2066.04]  like they had
[2066.04 --> 2066.96]  crushed so many
[2066.96 --> 2067.54]  protests
[2067.54 --> 2068.00]  before
[2068.00 --> 2069.40]  and I love
[2069.40 --> 2070.02]  his reply
[2070.02 --> 2070.52]  he said
[2070.52 --> 2071.52]  we had
[2071.52 --> 2072.86]  no contingency
[2072.86 --> 2073.50]  plans
[2073.50 --> 2074.82]  for songs
[2074.82 --> 2080.78]  they're
[2080.78 --> 2081.46]  singing
[2081.46 --> 2082.80]  stop
[2082.80 --> 2083.96]  they didn't
[2083.96 --> 2084.28]  know what
[2084.28 --> 2084.64]  to do
[2084.64 --> 2084.96]  with that
[2084.96 --> 2087.28]  Simeon is
[2087.28 --> 2087.98]  often described
[2087.98 --> 2088.44]  as singing
[2088.44 --> 2089.06]  Anna as well
[2089.06 --> 2090.44]  Simeon doesn't
[2090.44 --> 2092.16]  sing of angels
[2092.16 --> 2092.78]  and mangers
[2092.78 --> 2093.62]  but of letting
[2093.62 --> 2094.28]  go and of
[2094.28 --> 2094.94]  dying and yet
[2094.94 --> 2095.42]  how hope
[2095.42 --> 2096.16]  still prevails
[2096.16 --> 2097.52]  in this baby
[2097.52 --> 2098.42]  promises are
[2098.42 --> 2098.82]  fulfilled
[2098.82 --> 2099.66]  and then Anna
[2099.66 --> 2100.80]  sings of praise
[2100.80 --> 2101.54]  and thanksgiving
[2101.54 --> 2102.52]  because Christ
[2102.52 --> 2103.02]  has come
[2103.02 --> 2103.90]  and then you
[2103.90 --> 2104.46]  and I are
[2104.46 --> 2105.20]  called to
[2105.20 --> 2105.74]  sing
[2105.74 --> 2108.68]  and I know
[2108.68 --> 2109.16]  we can't get
[2109.16 --> 2109.76]  together and
[2109.76 --> 2110.02]  sing
[2110.02 --> 2110.94]  but we can
[2110.94 --> 2111.48]  get together
[2111.48 --> 2111.98]  and sing
[2111.98 --> 2115.64]  in this season
[2115.64 --> 2116.76]  a lot of us
[2116.76 --> 2117.04]  have our
[2117.04 --> 2117.74]  favorite carols
[2117.74 --> 2119.98]  I know Dave's
[2119.98 --> 2120.36]  favorite is
[2120.36 --> 2120.88]  Silent Night
[2120.88 --> 2123.30]  and you know
[2123.30 --> 2124.20]  others love
[2124.20 --> 2124.70]  joy to the
[2124.70 --> 2125.26]  world and
[2125.26 --> 2125.96]  there's Hark
[2125.96 --> 2126.56]  the Herald
[2126.56 --> 2127.14]  I mean all
[2127.14 --> 2127.52]  the great ones
[2127.52 --> 2128.28]  I love
[2128.28 --> 2128.96]  Go Tell It
[2128.96 --> 2129.42]  on the Mountain
[2129.42 --> 2129.90]  it has this
[2129.90 --> 2130.54]  missional feel
[2130.54 --> 2130.92]  to it
[2130.92 --> 2132.02]  but I was
[2132.02 --> 2132.38]  looking at
[2132.38 --> 2132.58]  you know
[2132.58 --> 2133.12]  at songs
[2133.12 --> 2133.60]  that I don't
[2133.60 --> 2134.20]  normally listen
[2134.20 --> 2134.32]  to
[2134.32 --> 2134.64]  I listen
[2134.64 --> 2135.04]  to one
[2135.04 --> 2135.52]  called
[2135.52 --> 2136.72]  In the Bleak
[2136.72 --> 2137.48]  Midwinter
[2137.48 --> 2139.24]  you can look
[2139.24 --> 2139.46]  it up
[2139.46 --> 2139.92]  you can listen
[2139.92 --> 2140.26]  to it
[2140.26 --> 2141.42]  the title
[2141.42 --> 2141.96]  caught me
[2141.96 --> 2144.70]  and the song
[2144.70 --> 2145.40]  reminds us
[2145.40 --> 2145.96]  that Christ
[2145.96 --> 2146.86]  came not only
[2146.86 --> 2147.74]  for the joyful
[2147.74 --> 2148.78]  but also
[2148.78 --> 2149.98]  for the despairing
[2149.98 --> 2153.10]  those living
[2153.10 --> 2153.94]  with regrets
[2153.94 --> 2156.34]  with loss
[2156.34 --> 2158.00]  there's a number
[2158.00 --> 2158.32]  of our
[2158.32 --> 2159.40]  community
[2159.40 --> 2159.78]  who have
[2159.78 --> 2161.40]  lost this year
[2161.40 --> 2162.46]  and this
[2162.46 --> 2162.82]  time of year
[2162.82 --> 2163.04]  is going
[2163.04 --> 2163.20]  to be
[2163.20 --> 2163.52]  a little
[2163.52 --> 2163.88]  tougher
[2163.88 --> 2164.90]  there's those
[2164.90 --> 2165.40]  living with
[2165.40 --> 2165.80]  loneliness
[2165.80 --> 2166.48]  living with
[2166.48 --> 2166.92]  struggle
[2166.92 --> 2169.18]  not feeling
[2169.18 --> 2169.64]  merry
[2169.64 --> 2171.14]  with COVID
[2171.14 --> 2171.40]  around
[2171.40 --> 2172.66]  even more so
[2172.66 --> 2173.62]  and they
[2173.62 --> 2174.16]  would prefer
[2174.16 --> 2174.68]  to sing
[2174.68 --> 2175.32]  laments
[2175.32 --> 2176.24]  and I would
[2176.24 --> 2176.60]  say
[2176.60 --> 2177.80]  do that
[2177.80 --> 2181.02]  just sing
[2181.02 --> 2181.56]  your songs
[2181.56 --> 2185.16]  because Christ
[2185.16 --> 2185.62]  is coming
[2185.62 --> 2186.72]  precisely where
[2186.72 --> 2187.32]  you are
[2187.32 --> 2189.60]  and he
[2189.60 --> 2190.16]  invites you
[2190.16 --> 2190.56]  to sing
[2190.56 --> 2194.72]  I love
[2194.72 --> 2195.32]  the scripture
[2195.32 --> 2196.06]  where it
[2196.06 --> 2196.48]  pictures
[2196.48 --> 2197.26]  God
[2197.26 --> 2197.72]  singing
[2197.72 --> 2198.46]  over us
[2198.46 --> 2201.20]  we sing
[2201.20 --> 2201.66]  in turn
[2201.66 --> 2203.10]  and then
[2203.10 --> 2203.58]  in him
[2203.58 --> 2204.90]  and because
[2204.90 --> 2205.34]  of Christ
[2205.34 --> 2205.66]  coming
[2205.66 --> 2206.22]  hope is
[2206.22 --> 2206.70]  restored
[2206.70 --> 2207.84]  and justice
[2207.84 --> 2208.30]  comes
[2208.30 --> 2209.04]  and peace
[2209.04 --> 2209.54]  prevails
[2209.54 --> 2209.98]  and deep
[2209.98 --> 2210.50]  joy sets
[2210.50 --> 2210.76]  in
[2210.76 --> 2211.96]  because his
[2211.96 --> 2212.28]  love
[2212.28 --> 2213.44]  has come
[2213.44 --> 2214.96]  darkness
[2214.96 --> 2216.44]  is overcome
[2216.44 --> 2219.26]  because his
[2219.26 --> 2219.74]  love has
[2219.74 --> 2220.18]  come
[2220.18 --> 2221.74]  brokenness
[2221.74 --> 2222.64]  and walls
[2222.64 --> 2223.46]  of divisiveness
[2223.46 --> 2224.06]  are torn
[2224.06 --> 2224.50]  down
[2224.50 --> 2227.70]  we need
[2227.70 --> 2228.04]  that so
[2228.04 --> 2228.36]  much
[2228.36 --> 2230.22]  I'd like
[2230.22 --> 2230.62]  to close
[2230.62 --> 2230.90]  with a
[2230.90 --> 2231.24]  verse
[2231.24 --> 2233.44]  out of
[2233.44 --> 2233.94]  Ephesians
[2233.94 --> 2234.42]  where Paul
[2234.42 --> 2235.08]  writes this
[2235.08 --> 2237.06]  remember
[2237.06 --> 2237.76]  at that
[2237.76 --> 2238.32]  time
[2238.32 --> 2240.24]  prior to
[2240.24 --> 2240.58]  Christ
[2240.58 --> 2241.18]  you were
[2241.18 --> 2241.56]  separate
[2241.56 --> 2242.36]  from Christ
[2242.36 --> 2243.62]  excluded
[2243.62 --> 2244.48]  from citizenship
[2244.48 --> 2245.02]  in Israel
[2245.02 --> 2245.58]  and foreigners
[2245.58 --> 2245.94]  to the
[2245.94 --> 2246.22]  covenant
[2246.22 --> 2247.48]  of promise
[2247.48 --> 2248.20]  without hope
[2248.20 --> 2248.86]  and without
[2248.86 --> 2249.38]  God in the
[2249.38 --> 2249.66]  world
[2249.66 --> 2251.42]  but now
[2251.42 --> 2251.90]  Christ
[2251.90 --> 2252.44]  Jesus
[2252.44 --> 2253.42]  now in
[2253.42 --> 2253.66]  Christ
[2253.66 --> 2253.92]  Jesus
[2253.92 --> 2254.50]  you who
[2254.50 --> 2254.90]  were once
[2254.90 --> 2255.38]  far away
[2255.38 --> 2255.66]  have been
[2255.66 --> 2256.10]  brought near
[2256.10 --> 2256.36]  by the
[2256.36 --> 2256.70]  blood of
[2256.70 --> 2257.10]  Christ
[2257.10 --> 2258.62]  for he
[2258.62 --> 2259.26]  himself
[2259.26 --> 2260.54]  he himself
[2260.54 --> 2261.24]  is our
[2261.24 --> 2261.78]  peace
[2261.78 --> 2263.06]  who has
[2263.06 --> 2263.50]  made
[2263.50 --> 2264.26]  the two
[2264.26 --> 2264.78]  groups
[2264.78 --> 2265.22]  whatever
[2265.22 --> 2265.58]  those two
[2265.58 --> 2265.82]  groups

[2289.66 --> 2290.00]  others
[2290.00 --> 2291.80]  that is the
[2291.80 --> 2292.42]  role that
[2292.42 --> 2293.24]  Jesus plays
[2293.24 --> 2294.18]  because Christ
