[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 65.14]  Grab your Bible, and as you do that, I will introduce us to our new Advent theme, which
[65.14 --> 67.08]  is just Christmas.
[68.16 --> 69.62]  And that's a bit of a play on words.
[69.86 --> 71.80]  In the one sense, we do mean just Christmas.
[71.92 --> 76.18]  We want to focus our hearts and our minds on the center of what the season is, and that
[76.18 --> 81.42]  is the birth and the coming of Jesus Christ, and not the way in which our culture celebrates
[81.42 --> 81.64]  it.
[81.64 --> 86.70]  I have those haunting words of Richard Horsley in my mind that we read last year on Christmas
[86.70 --> 92.66]  Eve, where he said, Christmas in the West is a pagan month-long festival of consumption.
[93.30 --> 96.02]  I shared that actually on Christmas Eve last year, and someone came up to me and said,
[96.08 --> 97.98]  did you really read that on Christmas Eve?
[97.98 --> 99.10]  That is so mean.
[99.10 --> 103.56]  But I do believe that there's insight in what Horsley is saying, and we want to focus our
[103.56 --> 105.24]  hearts on Jesus Christ.
[106.10 --> 108.64]  But secondly, when we say just, we mean justice.
[109.46 --> 114.26]  And what we want to do from week to week throughout Advent is show how when God reveals his plan
[114.26 --> 121.98]  of salvation, he pulls in the most unlikely people, this young teenage girl, these shepherds
[121.98 --> 126.68]  who are outsiders, always revealing to these people who are nobodies with no status and
[126.68 --> 129.14]  no power, this is what's going to happen.
[129.24 --> 131.62]  They're getting pulled into this drama of salvation.
[132.44 --> 137.94]  And we want to show you how the kingdom and the king are nothing like we expected, that subvert
[137.94 --> 141.96]  what we think about status, that subvert what we think about power, and reveal to us the
[141.96 --> 144.68]  very heart of God and his love for the poor.
[146.16 --> 151.12]  So we're going to start with one of the most well-known passages on the birth scene, and
[151.12 --> 152.42]  that is in Luke chapter 1.
[152.52 --> 153.48]  I invite you to turn with me.
[153.68 --> 156.26]  Luke chapter 1, we'll start at verse 26.
[156.26 --> 158.78]  This is Gabriel appearing to Mary.
[165.00 --> 171.66]  In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent an angel Gabriel to Nazareth.
[171.66 --> 172.98]  A town in Galilee.
[173.70 --> 177.42]  To a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.
[178.24 --> 179.66]  The virgin's name was Mary.
[180.42 --> 181.74]  The angel went to her and said,
[181.94 --> 184.10]  Greetings, you who are highly favored.
[184.52 --> 186.10]  The Lord is with you.
[187.04 --> 191.12]  Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
[191.84 --> 193.72]  The angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary.
[194.04 --> 195.64]  You have found favor with God.
[196.12 --> 199.80]  You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.
[199.80 --> 203.52]  He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.
[203.78 --> 208.86]  The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house
[208.86 --> 209.92]  of Jacob forever.
[210.34 --> 212.26]  His kingdom will never end.
[213.34 --> 214.92]  How will this be?
[215.54 --> 218.26]  Mary asked the angel, since I'm a virgin.
[219.42 --> 223.64]  The angel answered, The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will
[223.64 --> 224.60]  overshadow you.
[224.60 --> 228.14]  So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.
[228.58 --> 232.88]  Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child in her old age, and she who is
[232.88 --> 238.96]  said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month, for no word of God will ever fail.
[240.30 --> 242.66]  I am the Lord's servant, Mary answered.
[243.08 --> 245.72]  May it be to me according to your word.
[246.54 --> 247.68]  Then the angel left her.
[247.68 --> 252.02]  Now we jump down to Mary's song in verse 46.
[253.52 --> 254.28]  And Mary said,
[255.28 --> 262.14]  My soul glorifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has been mindful of
[262.14 --> 263.94]  the humble state of his servant.
[264.54 --> 270.42]  From now on, all generations will call me blessed, for the Mighty One has done great things for
[270.42 --> 270.78]  me.
[271.44 --> 272.92]  Holy is his name.
[272.92 --> 277.10]  His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.
[277.68 --> 280.16]  He has performed mighty deeds with his arm.
[280.40 --> 283.16]  He has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
[283.52 --> 287.40]  He has brought down rulers from their thrones, but has lifted up the humble.
[288.18 --> 292.02]  He has filled the hungry with good things, but he has sent the rich away empty.
[292.70 --> 298.40]  He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful to Abraham and his descendants forever,
[298.96 --> 301.28]  just as he promised our ancestors.
[301.28 --> 314.50]  I'm sure I'm not the only person in our church who is currently hooked on the Netflix season,
[314.80 --> 315.20]  The Crown.
[315.92 --> 317.68]  Are any of you watching that season right now?
[318.90 --> 321.52]  Brittany and I have been hooked on it from the beginning, and I'm still not sure why,
[321.62 --> 323.50]  because I find it incredibly depressing.
[323.86 --> 326.24]  If you're watching it, you'll know exactly what I mean.
[326.28 --> 329.34]  It's not a particularly warm and fuzzy kind of season.
[329.34 --> 336.02]  But a theme that threads its way through all the seasons so far is the theme of status.
[336.78 --> 343.54]  You have the power of the monarchy with its castles and its feasts and its lineage and all the rest,
[343.82 --> 348.78]  and then you have these ordinary folk in London with their ordinary, difficult lives,
[349.18 --> 355.84]  and that question of how does this status of the monarchy, this historical thing, relate to the everyday person?
[355.84 --> 362.88]  And there's one episode, which is actually a historical event, where a man, an ordinary lower-class man in London,
[363.00 --> 365.52]  decides to break in to Buckingham Palace.
[365.60 --> 369.36]  He hops a fence behind the back, he walks in the middle, apparently climbs up a drainpipe,
[369.52 --> 372.42]  and goes right into the room of Queen Elizabeth.
[373.18 --> 379.08]  If you've seen the episode, it's almost this eerie slow-motion scene of him standing in this gargantuous bedroom
[379.08 --> 380.76]  while the Queen is asleep.
[380.86 --> 386.82]  And what you feel as you watch it, at least what I felt, was, who does this guy think he is?
[387.74 --> 390.98]  He's standing right in front of the Queen.
[391.96 --> 394.54]  He's just this ordinary and lower-class guy.
[394.62 --> 399.04]  He has no business being in the presence of the monarch.
[399.04 --> 403.92]  And you think to yourself, he is in so much trouble.
[404.02 --> 406.28]  He doesn't belong there, and he's going to be punished.
[407.58 --> 412.70]  This kind of tension between this lower-class fellow in the presence of the Queen
[412.70 --> 419.18]  is similar to the tension people in the first century might feel as they hear a story like this.
[419.82 --> 422.50]  I can imagine someone explaining the birth of Jesus
[422.50 --> 425.70]  and the people who first heard of this event saying,
[425.70 --> 428.14]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, who did Gabriel go to?
[429.04 --> 430.20]  Where does she live?
[430.98 --> 432.30]  Who are her parents?
[433.20 --> 437.40]  Okay, did you say shepherds were the ones who heard the angels?
[437.62 --> 440.80]  They saw this great choir of angels announcing this birth?
[441.42 --> 442.38]  Why them?
[443.36 --> 445.52]  And in Luke's account, and Luke loves doing this,
[445.80 --> 450.76]  he's showing how the announcement of this king who's coming comes to all the wrong people.
[451.24 --> 453.80]  It doesn't go to the palace, doesn't go to the center of Rome.
[453.80 --> 456.46]  It goes to the outsiders in the middle of nowhere
[456.46 --> 460.58]  who get brought into the most important news of world history,
[461.28 --> 462.46]  Jesus' coming.
[464.06 --> 471.32]  And you'll see throughout Luke's gospel this deep desire he has to show how Jesus is not like other kings.
[471.62 --> 473.92]  His kingdom is not like other kingdoms.
[474.16 --> 478.18]  It's completely upside down and subverting everything we think,
[478.18 --> 483.38]  even now, power, of status, of significant, who's in and who's out.
[483.38 --> 488.56]  And he holds before us this gospel, this kingdom, this life that is extended to the outsiders,
[489.04 --> 492.68]  the nobodies, the insignificance, the weak, and the poor.
[493.22 --> 493.90]  And Luke says,
[494.34 --> 496.54]  Welcome to the kingdom of God.
[496.54 --> 502.86]  Now, the first thing we know about this passage is the location.
[503.30 --> 504.20]  It's Nazareth.
[505.04 --> 508.72]  And you need to know that Nazareth is not a major hub of society.
[508.90 --> 513.96]  You know, when I think of any movie you watch right now that shows matters of global significance,
[513.96 --> 518.08]  like any superhero movie where it's all about the world being destroyed by some evil power,
[518.08 --> 523.40]  it always has these, like, shots of major cities like London and Tokyo and New York and Surrey.
[523.86 --> 524.28]  Just kidding.
[524.42 --> 525.22]  Surrey didn't make the list.
[525.22 --> 530.42]  It's always the important major cities where there's the catastrophe and where the conflict happens.
[531.00 --> 534.30]  Nazareth is the equivalent today of, like, a hundred-mile house.
[535.14 --> 539.50]  And no offense to anyone like Ross who moved or lives in a hundred-mile house.
[539.56 --> 540.80]  But it's nowhere town.
[541.04 --> 542.10]  Nothing happens here.
[542.10 --> 546.08]  And this is the place where God sends his messenger, Gabriel, to say,
[546.38 --> 550.04]  Announce this news to this teenager.
[550.80 --> 554.48]  And now we're introduced to the main character, Mary.
[555.22 --> 558.82]  Now, there's a lot you might think about Mary.
[558.82 --> 561.94]  If you grew up in the Catholic Church, you think a lot about Mary.
[562.04 --> 566.28]  You were in a tradition that thought very highly of Mary and still does.
[566.64 --> 570.08]  There's an incredible amount of artwork put out by the Catholic Church on Mary.
[570.16 --> 570.96]  She's a big deal.
[570.96 --> 577.96]  But if you grew up in the Protestant Church or even outside of the church, you've grown up in a tradition that says she's just another person.
[577.96 --> 585.54]  And I can't help but think, when I look at a passage like this and I spend time in it, no matter where you land on Mary, she's a very significant person.
[585.92 --> 593.06]  I mean, no one else carried Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, in their womb.
[593.92 --> 594.94]  That's a big deal.
[595.82 --> 599.96]  But let me give you a brief character sketch on this young person named Mary.
[599.96 --> 606.72]  From what we know, we don't know a whole lot, she was young, politically, culturally insignificant, and poor.
[607.82 --> 610.30]  Scholars guess between 13 and 15.
[610.40 --> 614.06]  That's younger than Nadia, who read our prayer this morning.
[614.76 --> 615.98]  13 and 15 years old.
[616.02 --> 616.70]  She's a teenager.
[616.70 --> 620.40]  Secondly, no knowledge is known of her lineage.
[620.48 --> 621.46]  She's not someone of status.
[621.56 --> 627.40]  If she was, they would have said, she's the daughter of so-and-so, the family of so-and-so from this place and this lineage.
[627.50 --> 630.00]  There's none of that because she's not significant.
[630.82 --> 637.90]  She's just an ordinary, blue-collar, working-class, poor family in 100-mile house Nazareth.
[638.48 --> 639.02]  That's Mary.
[639.02 --> 645.62]  And yet, to this working-class, blue-collar, nobody who's very insignificant in the grand scheme of things, God says,
[646.08 --> 647.74]  Gabriel, that's the person.
[648.14 --> 654.24]  That's the woman you are going to give the most significant news to about what's coming for my world and for your people.
[655.38 --> 655.68]  Mary.
[656.54 --> 661.02]  And to this teenage girl, Gabriel shows up and says,
[661.42 --> 664.18]  Greetings, highly favored one.
[664.76 --> 667.50]  The Lord is with you.
[667.50 --> 675.88]  And I encourage you just right now to imagine what it would have been like to be Mary, perhaps working in her home,
[676.36 --> 680.12]  and all of a sudden this angel shows up and says that kind of statement to you.
[681.56 --> 685.14]  And I love this statement because, first of all, when the angel Gabriel says,
[685.32 --> 690.86]  Greetings, highly favored one, that phrase, favored, is the same word we use to say grace.
[692.66 --> 693.52]  Greetings, Mary.
[694.20 --> 696.26]  The grace of God has come to you.
[696.26 --> 697.52]  The Lord is with you.
[697.56 --> 698.96]  And it's not because of where you're from.
[699.20 --> 700.76]  It's not because of what family you come from.
[700.82 --> 703.06]  It's not because of your status, your education, your pedigree.
[703.26 --> 705.56]  It's because the grace of the Lord has found you.
[705.82 --> 711.46]  And if anything, it's because of your lowliness and your humble position.
[712.48 --> 716.24]  That's the kind of person the Father sends the Son to.
[717.86 --> 719.88]  And Mary, this is a very human story, by the way.
[719.92 --> 721.14]  If you read this, you'll just notice that.
[721.20 --> 723.42]  Mary says very human, ordinary things.
[723.42 --> 725.12]  The first thing is, she's troubled.
[725.78 --> 726.78]  She's perplexed.
[726.86 --> 728.74]  She's confused by this announcement.
[728.86 --> 730.00]  What is he going to say to me?
[730.30 --> 733.10]  And so Gabriel elaborates with giving the most incredible news.
[733.18 --> 734.16]  He says, don't be afraid.
[735.40 --> 736.88]  You have found favor with God.
[737.12 --> 739.90]  You're going to conceive and give birth to a son,
[740.26 --> 741.40]  and you're going to call him Jesus.
[742.10 --> 745.14]  He will be great, and he will be called Son of the Most High.
[745.44 --> 748.44]  The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David,
[748.44 --> 751.54]  and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever.
[752.08 --> 755.26]  His kingdom will never end.
[757.48 --> 759.22]  One minute you're in your house working,
[759.82 --> 761.22]  the next minute you're told,
[761.98 --> 765.64]  the Son of the Most High is going to be conceived in your womb.
[766.22 --> 768.38]  The one who's going to sit on the throne of David
[768.38 --> 769.92]  and establish an everlasting kingdom.
[770.04 --> 772.32]  He's coming through your body.
[772.32 --> 776.28]  That must have blown her mind.
[777.36 --> 779.12]  And Mary, we need to be clear about this.
[779.30 --> 781.00]  She knew what Gabriel meant.
[781.10 --> 782.46]  She's part of the Israelite people.
[782.58 --> 783.06]  She's Jewish.
[783.42 --> 786.06]  She knows what everyone and her whole people are praying for.
[786.14 --> 787.08]  They're praying for a king.
[787.38 --> 788.72]  They're praying for someone to bring redemption.
[788.96 --> 790.62]  They're praying for God to show up in power,
[790.74 --> 792.80]  to heal his people, restore their place,
[792.92 --> 794.28]  and bring healing to his world.
[795.06 --> 797.56]  And Mary knows exactly what Gabriel is saying.
[797.62 --> 799.32]  He's like, that person you're praying for,
[799.32 --> 801.54]  that person your whole people group is paying for,
[801.54 --> 802.50]  he's come.
[803.04 --> 804.02]  He's coming through you.
[805.62 --> 807.58]  That must have been an instant game changer.
[809.02 --> 812.48]  And again, I just imagine this very young teenage girl
[812.48 --> 814.40]  sitting perhaps with friends in Nazareth
[814.40 --> 816.44]  who are all expecting,
[816.62 --> 819.04]  having sort of a young expecting moms group,
[819.38 --> 820.86]  and talking about their expectation.
[821.02 --> 824.68]  I think, how would Mary even tell people what's coming?
[825.62 --> 828.28]  Think of the expectation everyone has for their baby to come.
[828.28 --> 829.08]  What does she even say?
[829.18 --> 831.44]  Well, yeah, Gabriel showed up and he told me,
[831.54 --> 832.74]  I know you're not going to believe in me,
[832.84 --> 836.16]  but this is going to be the savior of the world.
[838.72 --> 841.46]  Now again, the humanity of Mary shows up very strongly
[841.46 --> 842.86]  in her next statement.
[843.38 --> 845.32]  Of course, she's known for incredible faith
[845.32 --> 846.30]  and responding humility.
[846.40 --> 847.30]  We're going to get to that in a minute.
[847.36 --> 848.60]  But her first statement is,
[849.96 --> 853.54]  how in the world is this going to happen?
[853.62 --> 855.50]  And Mary knows enough about the birds and the bees
[855.50 --> 856.94]  and how babies are born to know
[856.94 --> 859.02]  a man needs to be involved in the process.
[859.02 --> 861.74]  And Luke goes through painstaking detail to say,
[862.02 --> 862.86]  Mary is a virgin.
[863.14 --> 864.52]  And she herself says to Gabriel,
[864.72 --> 865.78]  I'm a virgin.
[866.44 --> 868.34]  I can't be pregnant.
[868.48 --> 870.64]  It's not possible to be pregnant.
[870.76 --> 872.44]  So if you want me to believe this,
[872.90 --> 874.18]  how is it going to happen?
[875.48 --> 877.48]  And then Gabriel discloses one of the great mysteries
[877.48 --> 880.06]  of the Christian faith in a very short statement.
[880.06 --> 883.40]  And he says, the Holy Spirit will come on you
[883.40 --> 887.48]  and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
[887.86 --> 888.98]  That's how, Mary.
[890.10 --> 890.82]  That's how.
[891.76 --> 892.82]  And that little statement,
[893.20 --> 896.08]  we bump into one of the most beautiful mysteries,
[896.22 --> 899.88]  and that is the divine conception of Jesus Christ.
[901.04 --> 903.50]  And he writes, one scholar who writes a commentary
[903.50 --> 904.48]  on the Gospel of Luke,
[904.54 --> 906.00]  he writes this about this moment.
[906.00 --> 908.70]  He says, God himself, the creator,
[909.20 --> 911.96]  will surround her completely with his sovereign power.
[912.52 --> 914.00]  God's power from outside,
[914.12 --> 916.06]  the indwelling spirit inside together,
[916.18 --> 918.16]  resulting in things being done
[918.16 --> 923.00]  that would otherwise be unthinkable in any other way.
[924.78 --> 926.56]  And yes, there have been many people,
[926.70 --> 927.52]  Christians throughout history,
[927.60 --> 929.08]  who have looked at this passage and said,
[929.82 --> 931.10]  I don't know about this.
[932.12 --> 933.52]  Joseph had to have been involved.
[934.36 --> 935.80]  This is too much for me.
[935.80 --> 939.58]  This is too unreal to really believe could happen.
[940.04 --> 941.34]  And N.T. Wright, along with others,
[941.72 --> 943.62]  wisely says, save your doubt.
[944.40 --> 945.18]  Save your questions,
[945.26 --> 946.76]  because in just a few chapters,
[947.10 --> 947.86]  Luke is going to tell you
[947.86 --> 949.42]  that this child grows up to be a man,
[949.56 --> 950.96]  a man who claims a kingdom,
[951.16 --> 953.14]  and then dies, gets put in a grave,
[953.36 --> 955.10]  a stone is rolled over his tomb.
[955.30 --> 956.52]  And guess what happens next?
[957.08 --> 959.48]  The same power that created life in the womb
[959.48 --> 963.14]  raises it to life, resurrected forever.
[963.54 --> 965.60]  Save your doubt for the greatest mystery,
[965.60 --> 967.82]  and the greatest miracle, the resurrection.
[969.82 --> 972.26]  Now, Christians and believers throughout the centuries,
[972.40 --> 974.10]  including the scriptures themselves,
[975.06 --> 977.68]  always grapple with the power of God,
[978.00 --> 979.56]  where they receive words like this,
[979.60 --> 981.28]  and they just put their hands on their head and say,
[981.52 --> 984.30]  how in the world can that be?
[984.30 --> 985.88]  How can God do this?
[985.92 --> 987.18]  How is this possible?
[987.88 --> 989.34]  And we realize that throughout the scriptures,
[989.56 --> 991.72]  God, in his amazing sovereign power,
[992.30 --> 995.28]  constantly partners with finite humans
[995.28 --> 997.46]  to accomplish incredible goals.
[997.96 --> 1000.00]  The salvation of the world through pregnancy.
[1000.94 --> 1001.78]  Think about that.
[1001.78 --> 1005.42]  And Mary, just like so many people before her,
[1005.62 --> 1006.64]  in her own line,
[1006.94 --> 1010.42]  have to stand in awe at the power of God who says,
[1010.84 --> 1011.66]  this is what's coming.
[1012.44 --> 1013.62]  I will do this.
[1013.92 --> 1015.08]  And Gabriel himself says,
[1015.34 --> 1018.34]  no word of the Lord will ever fail.
[1019.00 --> 1021.78]  The same creator who spoke life into existence
[1021.78 --> 1024.24]  will speak life into this womb.
[1024.24 --> 1025.86]  In fact, the word overshadow,
[1026.60 --> 1028.38]  overshadow the spirit overshadowing her,
[1028.58 --> 1031.32]  that's the same word we see in Genesis 1.
[1031.82 --> 1034.54]  The spirit of the Lord hovering over the waters.
[1035.32 --> 1036.48]  Life will come.
[1037.00 --> 1038.60]  The word of the Lord does not fail.
[1040.80 --> 1043.90]  Now we get to this beautiful statement of faith
[1043.90 --> 1045.50]  that Mary gives the generations,
[1046.16 --> 1049.10]  where she receives that incredible word from Gabriel,
[1049.36 --> 1049.98]  and she says,
[1049.98 --> 1053.06]  I am the Lord's servant.
[1054.24 --> 1057.16]  May it be to me according to your word.
[1058.20 --> 1060.66]  And anyone who studied the ancient Near Eastern world
[1060.66 --> 1061.48]  that she lives in,
[1062.06 --> 1063.72]  the context of the first century,
[1063.82 --> 1065.98]  they will say that Mary had a lot to be worried about.
[1066.80 --> 1068.28]  Mary had her family to think about.
[1068.50 --> 1070.48]  She had the rumor mill to think about.
[1070.72 --> 1072.42]  The status and the indecision
[1072.42 --> 1074.70]  that now sort of cast a shadow over them,
[1074.76 --> 1075.68]  over her being pregnant,
[1075.74 --> 1076.64]  and what it means for Joseph,
[1076.86 --> 1077.86]  what it means for her parents,
[1077.94 --> 1078.86]  the shame on the family.
[1079.08 --> 1080.68]  None of that comes into this scene.
[1081.56 --> 1082.82]  She's not worried about her status.
[1082.82 --> 1084.26]  She's not worried about what people will say.
[1084.48 --> 1086.02]  She's not worried about all that will come.
[1086.10 --> 1086.52]  She just says,
[1087.10 --> 1090.22]  May it be as the Lord God wishes.
[1090.74 --> 1091.94]  I am the Lord's servant.
[1092.28 --> 1094.62]  What obedient trust and faith.
[1096.24 --> 1097.84]  And Augustine has this beautiful quote,
[1097.90 --> 1098.68]  and I'll read it to you,
[1099.34 --> 1099.92]  where he says,
[1099.92 --> 1101.08]  when we read this passage,
[1101.18 --> 1103.02]  we realize that Christ was conceived
[1103.02 --> 1104.84]  first in Mary's heart
[1104.84 --> 1108.86]  before he was conceived in her womb.
[1111.78 --> 1113.16]  Then Mary gives us
[1113.16 --> 1115.70]  this incredible song of faith.
[1115.80 --> 1116.46]  This teenager,
[1116.74 --> 1117.66]  this teenage girl
[1117.66 --> 1119.56]  produces this song of faith
[1119.56 --> 1120.68]  that blesses the church
[1120.68 --> 1121.64]  throughout the generations.
[1122.08 --> 1124.56]  It's also got a name called the Magnificat,
[1124.56 --> 1126.42]  and I hope that right after,
[1126.58 --> 1127.58]  after this sermon,
[1128.22 --> 1129.16]  you go on YouTube
[1129.16 --> 1130.38]  and you search it
[1130.38 --> 1131.14]  and you listen to it
[1131.14 --> 1131.84]  because it's beautiful.
[1131.96 --> 1132.14]  In fact,
[1132.20 --> 1133.44]  I had it playing in the background
[1133.44 --> 1134.82]  during the preparation of this sermon,
[1135.04 --> 1137.28]  and it ministered to me all week long.
[1137.70 --> 1138.90]  And in this song,
[1139.66 --> 1141.10]  Mary again opens up
[1141.10 --> 1143.40]  the upside-down kingdom of God.
[1144.14 --> 1146.24]  And she focuses on two main things.
[1146.32 --> 1147.14]  The first thing is
[1147.14 --> 1148.50]  the mighty power
[1148.50 --> 1150.76]  and delivering power of God.
[1151.06 --> 1152.34]  He's got this outstretched,
[1152.54 --> 1153.28]  mighty arm.
[1153.28 --> 1155.02]  He's going to be the one who delivers.
[1155.54 --> 1156.70]  He's got so much power.
[1156.78 --> 1157.86]  This is a big God
[1157.86 --> 1159.04]  Mary sings about.
[1159.56 --> 1160.26]  But then we see
[1160.26 --> 1161.16]  throughout the second half
[1161.16 --> 1161.86]  of this whole song,
[1162.12 --> 1163.56]  how does he exercise it?
[1163.78 --> 1165.32]  How does he exert his power
[1165.32 --> 1165.90]  and his will?
[1166.14 --> 1166.74]  And she says,
[1167.02 --> 1168.02]  he exerts his power
[1168.02 --> 1168.86]  for the poor,
[1169.66 --> 1170.40]  for the weak,
[1171.06 --> 1171.82]  for the hungry,
[1172.12 --> 1173.12]  and for the oppressed.
[1173.58 --> 1174.88]  That's how God exercises
[1174.88 --> 1176.42]  his mighty power over his world.
[1176.66 --> 1177.70]  He extends his arm
[1177.70 --> 1178.36]  for the weak,
[1178.48 --> 1178.96]  the powerless,
[1179.12 --> 1179.44]  the poor,
[1179.48 --> 1179.92]  and the hungry.
[1180.74 --> 1181.14]  Wow.
[1181.60 --> 1182.66]  And then she says,
[1182.66 --> 1184.74]  and he opposes the proud,
[1185.22 --> 1185.68]  the wicked,
[1186.04 --> 1186.52]  the arrogant,
[1186.52 --> 1188.14]  and he's going to tear them down
[1188.14 --> 1188.96]  from their thrones
[1188.96 --> 1190.12]  because he's God
[1190.12 --> 1191.86]  and this world belongs to him.
[1192.60 --> 1193.98]  And so Mary sings
[1193.98 --> 1196.10]  of the God who's come to her.
[1196.38 --> 1197.64]  And this song needs to be seen
[1197.64 --> 1198.40]  in two ways
[1198.40 --> 1199.92]  and both are equally significant.
[1200.70 --> 1201.30]  Number one,
[1201.78 --> 1203.08]  Mary represents Israel.
[1203.82 --> 1204.48]  You should know that
[1204.48 --> 1204.90]  in Christmas
[1204.90 --> 1206.44]  I have this personal pet peeve,
[1206.50 --> 1207.70]  maybe it's just a pastor's thing,
[1207.70 --> 1209.76]  where we see the birth of Jesus
[1209.76 --> 1212.10]  as this sort of isolated event
[1212.10 --> 1213.50]  that has no backstory,
[1213.82 --> 1214.68]  no context,
[1215.04 --> 1215.72]  no Old Testament,
[1215.80 --> 1217.40]  just his baby born in Nazareth.
[1218.48 --> 1221.40]  Mary comes in the people of God.
[1221.52 --> 1222.64]  She knows the story.
[1222.72 --> 1223.68]  She's part of Israel.
[1223.96 --> 1225.64]  She's praying for the Messiah to come.
[1225.72 --> 1226.88]  She understands the story.
[1227.10 --> 1228.32]  And Mary in this passage
[1228.32 --> 1229.62]  represents Israel.
[1230.62 --> 1231.62]  Israel is weak
[1231.62 --> 1232.68]  and poor
[1232.68 --> 1233.60]  and powerless
[1233.60 --> 1235.02]  and they are oppressed.
[1235.48 --> 1236.46]  They lost their land.
[1236.56 --> 1237.78]  They lost their place of worship.
[1238.04 --> 1239.20]  They lost their status
[1239.20 --> 1240.02]  in so many ways.
[1240.34 --> 1241.92]  And God speaking to Mary
[1241.92 --> 1242.24]  is saying,
[1242.42 --> 1243.80]  I have not forgotten you, Israel.
[1244.66 --> 1245.72]  All the promises
[1245.72 --> 1247.14]  I made to Abraham,
[1247.36 --> 1248.22]  Isaac, Jacob,
[1248.36 --> 1249.36]  all the work
[1249.36 --> 1250.44]  in placing you in Canaan
[1250.44 --> 1251.64]  and giving you my law
[1251.64 --> 1252.86]  and giving you my presence,
[1252.96 --> 1254.40]  I have not forgotten any of it
[1254.40 --> 1255.36]  and all of it
[1255.36 --> 1256.34]  is coming to fulfillment
[1256.34 --> 1258.14]  through this child.
[1259.56 --> 1260.80]  Israel is represented
[1260.80 --> 1262.24]  by Mary personally.
[1262.24 --> 1264.12]  But this song is also
[1264.12 --> 1265.96]  a very personal statement of faith.
[1266.32 --> 1266.76]  It's a statement
[1266.76 --> 1268.00]  about her own humility.
[1268.18 --> 1268.52]  Mary is saying,
[1268.88 --> 1270.58]  I know I have no business
[1270.58 --> 1271.92]  being the person
[1271.92 --> 1273.02]  who carries Jesus.
[1273.70 --> 1275.06]  I have no claim to status,
[1275.18 --> 1276.08]  no claim to significance,
[1276.24 --> 1277.08]  no family lineage
[1277.08 --> 1277.96]  that makes me important
[1277.96 --> 1278.94]  and yet God
[1278.94 --> 1280.12]  in all of his glory
[1280.12 --> 1281.44]  and grace chose me.
[1282.48 --> 1283.50]  Praise the Lord.
[1284.48 --> 1285.72]  The upside down kingdom
[1285.72 --> 1287.46]  for those who don't belong,
[1287.54 --> 1289.32]  who get drawn into the beauty
[1289.32 --> 1290.42]  and the glory
[1290.42 --> 1292.24]  and love of the Father.
[1293.28 --> 1294.60]  That's what the song is about.
[1295.48 --> 1296.56]  The oppressed
[1296.56 --> 1297.90]  and the weak
[1297.90 --> 1299.16]  and the weak
[1299.16 --> 1300.04]  get lifted up.
[1300.58 --> 1301.20]  Well, God says,
[1301.58 --> 1302.14]  the rulers
[1302.14 --> 1303.12]  and the oppressors
[1303.12 --> 1304.00]  will get torn down
[1304.00 --> 1304.88]  and it's going to happen
[1304.88 --> 1306.40]  through that baby.
[1310.94 --> 1312.54]  When I look at this song,
[1313.04 --> 1314.68]  I can't help but say,
[1314.68 --> 1316.98]  what an amazing God
[1316.98 --> 1317.74]  we worship.
[1318.44 --> 1319.06]  It's a song
[1319.06 --> 1319.56]  that brings you
[1319.56 --> 1320.66]  right into his very heart,
[1320.72 --> 1322.12]  a God who loves
[1322.12 --> 1323.08]  and can't help
[1323.08 --> 1324.10]  but hear the cries
[1324.10 --> 1324.80]  of the oppressed.
[1325.24 --> 1325.88]  Even today,
[1326.30 --> 1326.80]  he's a God
[1326.80 --> 1327.70]  who can't help
[1327.70 --> 1328.64]  but hear the cries
[1328.64 --> 1329.48]  of the weak,
[1329.78 --> 1330.38]  the abused,
[1330.54 --> 1331.20]  the disadvantaged,
[1331.34 --> 1331.90]  the refugee,
[1332.10 --> 1332.74]  the outsider
[1332.74 --> 1335.22]  and work and act
[1335.22 --> 1336.48]  on their behalf.
[1337.50 --> 1337.90]  And Luke,
[1337.98 --> 1338.84]  if you read the whole gospel
[1338.84 --> 1339.34]  in one sitting,
[1339.42 --> 1340.70]  you'll see over and over
[1340.70 --> 1341.54]  and over again
[1341.54 --> 1342.48]  how he shows
[1342.48 --> 1345.12]  Jesus' entire ministry
[1345.12 --> 1347.40]  was pushing against
[1347.40 --> 1348.12]  those who thought
[1348.12 --> 1348.96]  they understood it,
[1349.46 --> 1350.42]  who thought they understood
[1350.42 --> 1351.62]  status and power
[1351.62 --> 1353.30]  and it flips everything
[1353.30 --> 1354.04]  on its head.
[1354.76 --> 1355.26]  And he says,
[1355.36 --> 1356.64]  the kingdom belongs
[1356.64 --> 1357.68]  to the poor.
[1358.18 --> 1359.32]  That's why Jesus' own beatitude,
[1359.66 --> 1360.68]  blessed are the poor,
[1361.04 --> 1362.06]  blessed are the meek,
[1362.52 --> 1363.78]  they will inherit the earth,
[1364.04 --> 1364.88]  they will inherit
[1364.88 --> 1365.78]  the kingdom of heaven.
[1366.70 --> 1367.08]  Blessed,
[1367.68 --> 1368.18]  lucky,
[1368.86 --> 1369.68]  they are the ones
[1369.68 --> 1370.72]  who receive the favor,
[1370.72 --> 1371.94]  the heart of God
[1371.94 --> 1373.24]  is in this passage.
[1374.52 --> 1375.52]  Now I want to spend
[1375.52 --> 1376.34]  the last few minutes
[1376.34 --> 1377.06]  I have this morning
[1377.06 --> 1377.94]  and we'll be coming back
[1377.94 --> 1379.14]  to this over the next few weeks
[1379.14 --> 1380.42]  asking the question
[1380.42 --> 1381.14]  for us today,
[1381.66 --> 1384.22]  how well do we live
[1384.22 --> 1385.60]  as citizens
[1385.60 --> 1387.22]  of this upside down kingdom
[1387.22 --> 1388.26]  in this way?
[1389.24 --> 1390.10]  If it's true
[1390.10 --> 1391.10]  that Jesus established
[1391.10 --> 1391.48]  a kingdom
[1391.48 --> 1392.00]  where the poor,
[1392.12 --> 1392.72]  the disadvantaged,
[1392.90 --> 1393.30]  the weak,
[1393.52 --> 1394.10]  the marginalized,
[1394.26 --> 1394.90]  those who don't seem
[1394.90 --> 1395.42]  like they belong
[1395.42 --> 1396.40]  are drawn in
[1396.40 --> 1397.02]  and loved,
[1397.36 --> 1397.80]  cared for,
[1397.90 --> 1398.58]  received grace,
[1398.68 --> 1399.30]  received mercy,
[1399.30 --> 1400.30]  are in fellowship
[1400.30 --> 1402.20]  how well are we living
[1402.20 --> 1403.44]  in that kingdom?
[1404.36 --> 1405.56]  Or to frame it very simply,
[1405.66 --> 1406.78]  how well are we following
[1406.78 --> 1408.14]  Jesus in his own
[1408.14 --> 1409.46]  pattern of life?
[1410.90 --> 1411.86]  Our culture,
[1412.10 --> 1412.96]  at least in my opinion,
[1413.64 --> 1414.92]  is just as obsessed
[1414.92 --> 1415.78]  with status
[1415.78 --> 1416.66]  and rank
[1416.66 --> 1417.32]  and hierarchy
[1417.32 --> 1417.84]  as Rome.
[1418.62 --> 1419.32]  It looks different,
[1419.52 --> 1420.30]  but we're still obsessed
[1420.30 --> 1420.68]  with it.
[1421.10 --> 1422.02]  We still live with
[1422.02 --> 1422.82]  this deep desire
[1422.82 --> 1424.18]  for upward mobility,
[1424.68 --> 1426.04]  to be in fellowship
[1426.04 --> 1426.82]  with the haves
[1426.82 --> 1428.38]  and not with the have-nots,
[1428.38 --> 1429.58]  to be with people
[1429.58 --> 1430.40]  who are significant,
[1431.06 --> 1431.72]  powerful,
[1432.20 --> 1432.82]  and influential
[1432.82 --> 1434.92]  and have status.
[1436.16 --> 1437.04]  On social media,
[1437.14 --> 1438.02]  you see this all the time,
[1438.08 --> 1438.72]  we want to be
[1438.72 --> 1439.56]  with the influencers.
[1439.74 --> 1440.48]  We want to be
[1440.48 --> 1441.26]  the influencers.
[1441.78 --> 1443.02]  We envy those people
[1443.02 --> 1444.38]  who have 11,000,
[1444.50 --> 1445.04]  2,000,
[1445.12 --> 1446.58]  5 million followers.
[1446.68 --> 1447.68]  We want to be that person,
[1448.06 --> 1450.06]  be that significant person.
[1450.66 --> 1451.84]  Or we look at that person
[1451.84 --> 1452.42]  who's up,
[1452.74 --> 1453.86]  higher up in our company
[1453.86 --> 1454.78]  and we say,
[1455.14 --> 1456.34]  I want that position.
[1457.02 --> 1458.04]  I want that power.
[1458.12 --> 1458.88]  I want the status
[1458.88 --> 1460.12]  that comes with that office
[1460.12 --> 1461.28]  and that floor
[1461.28 --> 1462.62]  with that kind of influence
[1462.62 --> 1463.68]  over the rest of the company.
[1463.88 --> 1465.08]  We just want that.
[1466.32 --> 1467.90]  We're obsessed with it.
[1468.48 --> 1469.24]  And I'm always struck,
[1469.38 --> 1469.70]  by the way,
[1469.74 --> 1470.70]  when fundraisers happen,
[1470.86 --> 1471.90]  even Christian fundraisers,
[1472.44 --> 1473.44]  when people want a fundraiser
[1473.44 --> 1474.28]  to be really significant,
[1474.36 --> 1474.90]  you know what they do?
[1475.68 --> 1476.74]  They bring in celebrities,
[1477.82 --> 1480.08]  people with status,
[1480.76 --> 1481.64]  with influence,
[1481.64 --> 1482.20]  and oftentimes
[1482.20 --> 1483.16]  it has nothing to do
[1483.16 --> 1483.82]  with their character.
[1484.26 --> 1485.16]  But those people
[1485.16 --> 1486.48]  will draw the crowds
[1486.48 --> 1487.62]  and they'll use that
[1487.62 --> 1488.56]  for raising money.
[1489.14 --> 1490.60]  I'm not necessarily opposed to it,
[1490.62 --> 1491.68]  but I find it's such a statement
[1491.68 --> 1492.26]  about status.
[1492.34 --> 1493.66]  You want to have a good fundraiser?
[1493.88 --> 1494.56]  Bring a celebrity
[1494.56 --> 1495.90]  who usually knows nothing
[1495.90 --> 1496.90]  about that cause
[1496.90 --> 1499.12]  to raise money for it.
[1500.40 --> 1500.88]  Status.
[1501.64 --> 1503.06]  And here's the real rub.
[1503.32 --> 1504.86]  I think the Western church
[1504.86 --> 1507.72]  swims way too well
[1507.72 --> 1509.30]  in this kind of culture.
[1509.30 --> 1513.20]  We are just as preoccupied
[1513.20 --> 1515.06]  with looking good,
[1515.16 --> 1516.12]  having influence,
[1516.30 --> 1517.68]  being people of significance,
[1517.94 --> 1519.22]  being people of status.
[1519.76 --> 1520.56]  We want church
[1520.56 --> 1521.72]  to look smooth
[1521.72 --> 1522.74]  and slick
[1522.74 --> 1523.86]  and polished
[1523.86 --> 1525.64]  and very well presented.
[1526.40 --> 1526.66]  I mean,
[1526.70 --> 1527.30]  let me just give you
[1527.30 --> 1528.00]  one example.
[1529.16 --> 1530.06]  This one is a tough one
[1530.06 --> 1530.32]  to share,
[1530.40 --> 1531.14]  but I think it's important.
[1531.84 --> 1533.24]  Already a year and a half ago,
[1533.56 --> 1534.22]  there's a bunch of people
[1534.22 --> 1535.22]  sitting around in our house
[1535.22 --> 1536.26]  when you could sit around
[1536.26 --> 1537.38]  with people in your house.
[1537.38 --> 1538.64]  Oh, how we miss those days.
[1539.14 --> 1540.28]  And we were talking about
[1540.28 --> 1541.36]  church online,
[1541.66 --> 1542.20]  live stream,
[1542.32 --> 1543.46]  before our church even did it.
[1543.80 --> 1544.98]  And one person was sharing
[1544.98 --> 1546.04]  that in the church
[1546.04 --> 1546.94]  they used to attend,
[1547.38 --> 1548.32]  they made sure,
[1548.46 --> 1549.20]  and I'm not joking
[1549.20 --> 1549.86]  when I say this,
[1550.12 --> 1551.82]  that very good looking,
[1552.10 --> 1552.88]  well dressed people
[1552.88 --> 1553.58]  were in the front.
[1555.02 --> 1555.76]  That's true right now,
[1555.80 --> 1556.00]  by the way.
[1556.02 --> 1556.48]  My wife,
[1556.56 --> 1557.18]  one of the few people here,
[1557.24 --> 1558.02]  she's sitting up front.
[1559.38 --> 1560.26]  But they made sure
[1560.26 --> 1561.52]  that the well dressed people
[1561.52 --> 1562.20]  put together,
[1562.50 --> 1563.54]  they looked nice,
[1563.62 --> 1564.36]  they were in the very front
[1564.36 --> 1565.32]  because they knew
[1565.32 --> 1566.60]  that in the live stream
[1566.60 --> 1567.40]  frame,
[1567.66 --> 1568.76]  which even in our own church
[1568.76 --> 1570.50]  I'm neglecting to stay in sometimes,
[1570.82 --> 1571.54]  but in that frame,
[1571.80 --> 1572.42]  they wanted anyone
[1572.42 --> 1573.08]  who looks online
[1573.08 --> 1574.18]  to see like a nice,
[1574.32 --> 1575.12]  put together,
[1575.32 --> 1575.96]  live stream,
[1576.32 --> 1577.14]  good looking people
[1577.14 --> 1577.60]  in the front,
[1577.78 --> 1578.36]  who wouldn't want
[1578.36 --> 1579.28]  to be part of that church?
[1581.98 --> 1583.12]  And I understand,
[1583.46 --> 1584.40]  I understand
[1584.40 --> 1585.70]  that pressure.
[1586.74 --> 1587.92]  But here's the question,
[1589.18 --> 1591.08]  would Mary be allowed
[1591.08 --> 1592.96]  on the front seats
[1592.96 --> 1594.12]  of our church?
[1594.12 --> 1595.54]  Could it be
[1595.54 --> 1596.62]  that in that very church,
[1596.90 --> 1597.78]  Mary shows up
[1597.78 --> 1598.38]  and an usher
[1598.38 --> 1599.28]  in gentleness
[1599.28 --> 1599.96]  and kindness says,
[1600.32 --> 1601.16]  is there any way
[1601.16 --> 1602.46]  you could sit further back?
[1602.72 --> 1603.24]  We're aiming
[1603.24 --> 1604.28]  for a certain look here,
[1604.38 --> 1605.22]  you just don't fit
[1605.22 --> 1605.98]  that mold,
[1606.46 --> 1606.72]  Mary.
[1608.48 --> 1609.74]  Or to frame it differently,
[1609.90 --> 1611.06]  how well does the church
[1611.06 --> 1612.14]  right now
[1612.14 --> 1614.28]  love and care for
[1614.28 --> 1615.92]  the single pregnant teenagers?
[1617.96 --> 1619.34]  Do they have fellowship
[1619.34 --> 1620.28]  in our church?
[1620.68 --> 1621.52]  Would they be welcome
[1621.52 --> 1622.74]  to your social media?
[1622.84 --> 1623.50]  Would they be welcome
[1623.50 --> 1623.94]  in your home?
[1623.98 --> 1624.60]  Would they be welcome
[1624.60 --> 1625.22]  in our small groups
[1625.22 --> 1626.56]  to the full life
[1626.56 --> 1627.10]  and fellowship
[1627.10 --> 1627.56]  of the church?
[1627.72 --> 1629.10]  Not just receiving care
[1629.10 --> 1630.36]  or being cared for
[1630.36 --> 1630.92]  at a soup kitchen,
[1631.04 --> 1632.14]  but actually part
[1632.14 --> 1632.76]  of the church.
[1634.60 --> 1635.68]  That's what it means
[1635.68 --> 1636.38]  to live
[1636.38 --> 1638.62]  in the upside down kingdom.
[1639.96 --> 1640.72]  A pastor
[1640.72 --> 1641.88]  I once knew
[1641.88 --> 1642.54]  in Ontario,
[1643.12 --> 1643.84]  he dressed up
[1643.84 --> 1644.78]  like a homeless person.
[1645.48 --> 1646.30]  And on a Sunday morning,
[1646.40 --> 1646.92]  he camped out
[1646.92 --> 1647.68]  on the front steps
[1647.68 --> 1648.32]  of his church.
[1648.38 --> 1648.96]  And I wouldn't recommend
[1648.96 --> 1649.78]  doing this during COVID
[1649.78 --> 1650.56]  because no one's coming
[1650.56 --> 1651.20]  to church in COVID.
[1651.20 --> 1652.92]  But he sat down
[1652.92 --> 1653.64]  and dressed up
[1653.64 --> 1654.30]  very effectively
[1654.30 --> 1655.34]  like a homeless person
[1655.34 --> 1656.18]  in front of his church
[1656.18 --> 1657.28]  just to see
[1657.28 --> 1659.12]  how his own church
[1659.12 --> 1661.28]  would walk by him.
[1661.94 --> 1662.96]  Would they engage him?
[1663.30 --> 1664.18]  Would they see him
[1664.18 --> 1664.96]  as an image bearer?
[1665.00 --> 1665.74]  Would they notice him?
[1665.80 --> 1666.42]  Would they be sort of
[1666.42 --> 1667.36]  afraid of him
[1667.36 --> 1668.68]  and sidestep around him?
[1668.68 --> 1669.92]  And he got a mixed response,
[1670.58 --> 1671.06]  of course.
[1671.52 --> 1672.16]  Some people were like,
[1672.24 --> 1673.06]  ah, not again.
[1673.30 --> 1673.94]  Walk around.
[1674.04 --> 1674.92]  And other people engaged him.
[1674.96 --> 1675.36]  Other people often
[1675.36 --> 1675.94]  buy coffee.
[1675.94 --> 1676.90]  But there's that sense.
[1676.96 --> 1677.56]  He wanted to know,
[1677.66 --> 1679.10]  does my church realize
[1679.10 --> 1680.92]  that this is what it means
[1680.92 --> 1682.74]  to be kingdom citizens?
[1683.12 --> 1684.18]  That this person
[1684.18 --> 1685.30]  receives care
[1685.30 --> 1686.24]  because we live
[1686.24 --> 1686.80]  in the kingdom.
[1687.38 --> 1688.38]  They have status.
[1688.70 --> 1689.40]  They have worth.
[1689.80 --> 1691.14]  They are worthy
[1691.14 --> 1692.58]  of the favor
[1692.58 --> 1694.38]  and the grace of God
[1694.38 --> 1696.38]  as much as anyone else
[1696.38 --> 1697.68]  who believes in Jesus.
[1699.98 --> 1701.64]  And I'll finish with this.
[1703.18 --> 1704.30]  Jesus never says
[1704.30 --> 1704.94]  to the church,
[1704.94 --> 1706.78]  I want you to look
[1706.78 --> 1707.52]  this way.
[1708.34 --> 1709.62]  I want you to appear
[1709.62 --> 1711.26]  in this kind of presentation
[1711.26 --> 1712.14]  on your live stream.
[1712.38 --> 1713.06]  I want your worship
[1713.06 --> 1714.12]  to have these tones.
[1714.22 --> 1714.78]  I want your preaching
[1714.78 --> 1715.56]  to have this style.
[1715.82 --> 1716.82]  What he does say
[1716.82 --> 1718.34]  is follow me.
[1719.88 --> 1720.82]  And then he proceeds
[1720.82 --> 1721.54]  to show us
[1721.54 --> 1723.00]  exactly how he wants us
[1723.00 --> 1723.48]  to live.
[1723.72 --> 1724.62]  And he's the one
[1724.62 --> 1726.16]  who's dining with outsiders.
[1726.36 --> 1727.54]  He's dining with tax collectors.
[1727.66 --> 1728.18]  And the Pharisees
[1728.18 --> 1728.78]  come up to him
[1728.78 --> 1730.06]  and they accuse him
[1730.06 --> 1731.60]  saying this man
[1731.60 --> 1732.56]  is a glutton
[1732.56 --> 1733.54]  and a drunkard.
[1733.54 --> 1734.98]  He's a friend
[1734.98 --> 1735.86]  of tax collectors
[1735.86 --> 1737.14]  and a friend
[1737.14 --> 1737.84]  of sinners.
[1739.68 --> 1741.30]  What an accusation
[1741.30 --> 1742.22]  to make
[1742.22 --> 1743.32]  of the son of man,
[1743.60 --> 1744.64]  the king who will sit
[1744.64 --> 1745.76]  on the throne forever.
[1746.12 --> 1747.56]  This man is a friend
[1747.56 --> 1748.88]  of sinners.
[1750.12 --> 1751.26]  He dines
[1751.26 --> 1752.14]  with outsiders.
[1752.70 --> 1753.66]  He has the boldness
[1753.66 --> 1754.36]  to forgive
[1754.36 --> 1755.24]  the people
[1755.24 --> 1756.92]  who seem unforgivable.
[1757.44 --> 1757.96]  Welcome
[1757.96 --> 1759.18]  to the kingdom
[1759.18 --> 1760.12]  of God.
[1761.52 --> 1762.32]  And Jesus says
[1762.32 --> 1762.86]  to everyone
[1762.86 --> 1764.18]  who claims faith
[1764.18 --> 1764.82]  in him
[1764.82 --> 1765.80]  as king and savior,
[1766.88 --> 1768.50]  follow me.
[1769.76 --> 1770.40]  Live
[1770.40 --> 1772.90]  in the upside down kingdom
[1772.90 --> 1774.54]  where Mary
[1774.54 --> 1775.82]  and the shepherds
[1775.82 --> 1776.78]  and the poor
[1776.78 --> 1777.88]  and the weak
[1777.88 --> 1779.00]  belong.
[1780.00 --> 1780.80]  All
[1780.80 --> 1781.64]  by
[1781.64 --> 1782.78]  grace.
[1783.98 --> 1784.88]  Let's pray.
[1784.88 --> 1784.94]  Amen.
[1784.94 --> 1790.06]  Father,
[1790.14 --> 1790.64]  we thank you
[1790.64 --> 1791.32]  for your word.
[1792.90 --> 1793.56]  We thank you
[1793.56 --> 1793.84]  that
[1793.84 --> 1795.30]  your kingdom
[1795.30 --> 1796.08]  is not like
[1796.08 --> 1796.54]  the kingdoms
[1796.54 --> 1797.30]  of this world.
[1798.88 --> 1799.18]  And Lord,
[1799.22 --> 1800.54]  we feel that challenge
[1800.54 --> 1802.08]  recognizing
[1802.08 --> 1802.92]  that we drink
[1802.92 --> 1803.40]  the water
[1803.40 --> 1804.00]  of our culture,
[1804.10 --> 1804.74]  we swim in it
[1804.74 --> 1805.26]  so well
[1805.26 --> 1805.78]  of status,
[1805.88 --> 1806.40]  of power,
[1806.82 --> 1807.84]  of upward mobility.
[1807.98 --> 1808.34]  And Lord,
[1808.44 --> 1808.90]  I pray
[1808.90 --> 1810.24]  you would send us
[1810.24 --> 1810.76]  as brothers
[1810.76 --> 1811.42]  and sisters
[1811.42 --> 1812.90]  to love
[1812.90 --> 1813.60]  your city,
[1814.26 --> 1814.90]  all of it.
[1815.74 --> 1816.26]  We pray
[1816.26 --> 1816.72]  that we'd have
[1816.72 --> 1817.78]  eyes to see
[1817.78 --> 1819.82]  those who need
[1819.82 --> 1820.32]  your care.
[1821.38 --> 1821.98]  We pray
[1821.98 --> 1822.68]  that you'd give us
[1822.68 --> 1823.78]  new levels
[1823.78 --> 1824.50]  of patience
[1824.50 --> 1825.46]  and love
[1825.46 --> 1826.36]  and grace
[1826.36 --> 1827.72]  and hospitality
[1827.72 --> 1828.90]  for the least
[1828.90 --> 1829.34]  of these
[1829.34 --> 1830.34]  who are our neighbors
[1830.34 --> 1832.08]  and your image bearers
[1832.08 --> 1832.78]  that you love.
[1834.02 --> 1834.46]  Lord,
[1834.56 --> 1835.04]  send us
[1835.04 --> 1835.74]  as a church
[1835.74 --> 1837.22]  to be citizens
[1837.22 --> 1838.62]  of your upside down
[1838.62 --> 1838.92]  kingdom.
[1839.98 --> 1840.32]  Fill us
[1840.32 --> 1841.10]  with your spirit
[1841.10 --> 1842.14]  give us
[1842.14 --> 1842.78]  your eyes.
[1843.54 --> 1843.78]  Amen.
[1847.00 --> 1847.82]  Our final
[1847.82 --> 1848.72]  song of response
[1848.72 --> 1849.60]  is one that we sang
[1849.60 --> 1850.64]  a fair bit last year.
[1850.78 --> 1851.12]  It's called
[1851.12 --> 1852.26]  King of Kings.
[1852.82 --> 1853.52]  And just notice
[1853.52 --> 1854.26]  the first verse
[1854.26 --> 1854.96]  that descent.
[1855.16 --> 1855.72]  The Father,
[1856.26 --> 1857.16]  he's in heaven.
[1857.58 --> 1858.44]  Jesus is enjoying
[1858.44 --> 1859.64]  glory with God
[1859.64 --> 1860.70]  and descends
[1860.70 --> 1861.42]  to a cradle
[1861.42 --> 1862.30]  in the dirt.
[1862.44 --> 1863.04]  So let's stand
[1863.04 --> 1863.82]  as we sing together.
