[0.00 --> 17.56]  well good morning hope it's good to be back after a few weeks of vacation with family
[17.56 --> 22.26]  it's always nice to be in your home church and it's nice to be together and worship
[23.58 --> 27.48]  i'm sure you feel what i do and that is that this is like the weirdest september
[27.48 --> 34.46]  ever i feel like a lot of us feel disconnected and some of us haven't seen each other for like
[34.46 --> 40.10]  six months and we're all growing up and changing our toddlers are now walking etc it's quite a
[40.10 --> 46.26]  strange season still i also think it's a tenuous season where everything feels a little bit open
[46.26 --> 51.92]  ended and uncertain and decisions never feel final i was told even by one of the youth here on their
[51.92 --> 57.18]  first day of school that they started betting on when it's shutting down again and i'm not going
[57.18 --> 64.20]  to say the date that i would bet on but it's not super far away it's a strange season and for sid and
[64.20 --> 69.98]  i you know we remember i'm many of you do too last september on this very sunday we were like
[69.98 --> 75.70]  ramping up we were relaunching the second service we had a barbecue where pete and gourd were firing
[75.70 --> 81.58]  up like 600 hamburgers for the community and for our church it was like um a ministry fair where we're
[81.58 --> 86.28]  signing up to serve and all these new ministries it was like a buzz of preparation and if we try to do
[86.28 --> 92.72]  that today oh man we'd have the cops show up again steve and megan their marriage happened here and
[92.72 --> 98.78]  yes we did have the police show up shame on that wedding party for social distancing it's a strange
[98.78 --> 104.70]  season and the question we had over august was what do you preach on in september of 2020 we just
[104.70 --> 110.78]  finished ecclesiastes do we move on to lamentations is that is that the right sermon series we're going
[110.78 --> 115.36]  to preach on belong believe become or belonging believing becoming i think that's a more fitting
[115.36 --> 120.56]  way of putting it and we want to hunker down and focus our hearts and our minds on what it means to be
[120.56 --> 129.06]  the church right here right now what does it mean to belong to this community in this season and join
[129.06 --> 136.40]  christ in his mission in this city in this season now before i read our passage i just want to orrent us
[136.40 --> 141.80]  a little bit on what this letter that we're going to read is all about this letter is written to very
[141.80 --> 149.60]  small churches scattered across the roman empire asia minor these churches are small they are powerless
[149.60 --> 155.60]  i mean many of them people estimate are between 15 and 20 people large the roman empire is increasingly
[155.60 --> 162.02]  suspicious the public is increasingly hostile to the christian faith it's not an easy time to be a
[162.02 --> 167.72]  christian and yet they would still gather many of them cautiously to hear these letters read to worship
[167.72 --> 174.42]  and to pray and you're i encourage you just to imagine being a christian in the first century and
[174.42 --> 178.96]  hearing this letter read to you as you know it goes from church to church this is a circular letter
[178.96 --> 184.82]  and so try to imagine reading this church as a first century believer this comes from first peter 2
[184.82 --> 196.76]  therefore rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit hypocrisy envy and slander of every kind like newborn
[196.76 --> 204.16]  babies crave spiritual milk so that by it you may grow up in your salvation now that you've tasted that the
[204.16 --> 214.14]  lord is good as you come to him the living stone rejected by human beings but chosen by god and precious to him
[214.14 --> 221.64]  you also like living stones are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood offering
[221.64 --> 229.74]  spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ for in scripture it says see i lay a stone in
[229.74 --> 237.66]  zion a chosen and precious cornerstone and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame
[237.66 --> 243.76]  now to you who believe this stone is precious but to those who do not believe the stone that the
[243.76 --> 250.30]  builders rejected has become the cornerstone and a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that
[250.30 --> 256.04]  makes them fall they stumble because they disobey the message which is also what they were destined for
[256.04 --> 267.00]  but you are chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation god's special possession that you may
[267.00 --> 273.22]  declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light once you were not a
[273.22 --> 280.26]  people but now you are the people of god once you would not receive mercy but now you have received
[280.26 --> 287.60]  mercy dear friends i urge you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from the sinful desires which war
[287.60 --> 294.08]  against your soul live such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong
[294.08 --> 298.42]  they may see your good deeds and glorify god on the day he visits us
[298.42 --> 310.38]  i want you to imagine yourself sitting on a bench at hillcrest park which is just across fraser highways
[310.38 --> 316.28]  which way is it across fraser highway across fraser highway you're sitting on a bench enjoying the
[316.28 --> 322.44]  beautiful weather and a neighbor who lives two doors down from you walking her dog comes up to you and
[322.44 --> 328.68]  says hey how are you doing you look at your neighbor and the two of you engage in the most stereotypical
[328.68 --> 335.74]  clayton conversation you talk about the crime talk about the parking talk about the dog poop that people
[335.74 --> 340.98]  aren't picking up in the park tell me i'm wrong this isn't the clayton conversation and after that small
[340.98 --> 348.10]  talk finishes mercifully she says to you hey every sunday morning i'm walking my dog down 85th and i see you
[348.10 --> 354.12]  walking over to that church across the road and at this point you're feeling a little nervous you're
[354.12 --> 359.36]  thinking man this woman's really watching me here where's this conversation going and she says to you with
[359.36 --> 370.06]  genuine honesty why do you go there what is church all about anyway what's the first thing you would say to
[370.06 --> 375.38]  that woman i'll give you a moment to think about what would you say to anyone in the neighborhood
[375.38 --> 383.68]  says to you what why do you go to church i'll let that percolate and we'll come back to that at the
[383.68 --> 390.30]  end of the sermon i think we happen to live in a moment culturally speaking where church feels very
[390.30 --> 395.66]  small feels insignificant i bet you you feel that in a variety of ways in your neighborhood in your
[395.66 --> 401.26]  workplace with your friends perhaps church i think generally speaking is an antiquated
[401.26 --> 407.42]  outdated thing it's like what your grandparents did it's like their tradition we don't need religion
[407.42 --> 411.94]  anymore we don't need church anymore we understand science we'd like to be in control of our own lives
[411.94 --> 418.88]  so church is sort of this small insignificant strange community in the midst of this western culture
[418.88 --> 426.20]  we live in one of the ways i feel that is whenever people ask me about what i do for a living about
[426.20 --> 430.76]  six months ago i was skating with my kids at cloverdale arena i was actually helping this young
[430.76 --> 436.28]  guy learn how to skate it was his first time on the ice and we got to talking he worked at telus a
[436.28 --> 441.42]  nice tech relevant job in modern day society and after a while he said well what do you do for a
[441.42 --> 446.18]  living i gave him three guesses knowing there wasn't a chance he was going to guess what i did for a
[446.18 --> 451.28]  living and finally when i said to him that i was a pastor he paused and just kind of looked at me
[451.28 --> 459.00]  not knowing what to say and all he could say was huh so that's like like an actual job i was like
[459.00 --> 465.38]  yeah i would say it's a job but those moments and i'm sure again you have your own are moments where
[465.38 --> 471.80]  you think wow culturally speaking this is a strange small outdated community
[471.80 --> 478.50]  and we feel more and more i think that we're pushed to the margins of society we're not in the
[478.50 --> 483.40]  center we don't have a great deal of power and political influence we feel the smallness of what
[483.40 --> 488.38]  it means to be the church today and i think there's a lot of good pieces to that i think there's a lot of
[488.38 --> 495.06]  fruit that can come out of being a small seemingly powerless community one of the things i think it will
[495.06 --> 501.96]  force us to do because no one's making us go to church especially now is you have to decide why
[501.96 --> 505.68]  you're part of the church few of us are being forced to none of us have to go to church so you
[505.68 --> 513.10]  have to have a sense of what makes me want to belong to a church why would i do that and for those of
[513.10 --> 517.08]  you going off to university the next couple years that will be a question you face then now that my
[517.08 --> 524.40]  parents don't force me to church why would i want to be and belong to this kind of community
[524.40 --> 531.10]  and this morning we want to look at what does it mean to be the church what is the church and i want
[531.10 --> 538.78]  us to realize that we cannot have our definition shaped by cultural assumptions but by biblical
[538.78 --> 545.34]  definition and i'm realizing more and more that there's all these reductions of what it means to be
[545.34 --> 553.76]  the church that we even buy into that don't capture the hugeness of what god says we are as the body of
[553.76 --> 560.74]  christ we are more than just a gathering of like-minded religious individuals we are more than just a
[560.74 --> 566.10]  community that cares for the poor and the vulnerable we are more than just a place that gives moral
[566.10 --> 576.88]  instruction to children we are the people who belong to god we are the people who have been set free
[576.88 --> 584.96]  through jesus christ to live human lives that were intended from the very beginning we're free people
[584.96 --> 592.52]  we have been filled with the very power and presence of the holy spirit who brings life and restoration
[592.52 --> 600.70]  and freedom to us as a community and we're the people god sends into neighborhoods saying share
[600.70 --> 605.42]  that life that's the church
[605.42 --> 614.42]  now when first peter when peter writes this letter he's writing as i mentioned to a whole host of small
[614.42 --> 619.44]  house churches and if you think we feel powerless in western culture today especially west coast
[619.44 --> 625.14]  canadian culture they would have felt it even more they were persecuted increasingly as different roman
[625.14 --> 630.14]  emperors got into power there was more and more cracking down in the church and as generations and
[630.14 --> 636.02]  time passed there was more persecution and when persecution happens you really have to decide am i in
[636.02 --> 643.34]  on what the church is all about and what does it mean to be the church one commentator in first peter
[643.34 --> 648.02]  writes this and i really like this quote he writes for this fledgling movement and it was fledgling
[648.02 --> 654.26]  its members residing in households dispersed through thousands of miles of asia minor territory
[654.26 --> 658.26]  needed a sense of all that bound them together as a distinctive community
[658.26 --> 663.50]  and a resolve to maintain that community however great the cost
[663.50 --> 672.28]  now i've read a fair bit on covid19 and how it will shape the church in fact i think i'm fatigued by
[672.28 --> 676.58]  reading about covid19 and how it will shape the church and there's a lot of different takes some say
[676.58 --> 680.22]  the church is going to shrink because of it because all those who are sort of marginally involved are
[680.22 --> 683.82]  going to leave other people say no it's actually going to grow because of it because god's going to
[683.82 --> 689.66]  give a hunger to people who are experiencing isolation and i say let's pray for the latter and time will tell
[689.66 --> 696.24]  but i think covid even now is forcing people to ask the question what in the world does it mean for us
[696.24 --> 700.66]  and our family and me as an individual to be part of a church what am i missing when i'm not there
[700.66 --> 704.96]  and part of it what am i gaining when i'm part of this community it's an important season of asking
[704.96 --> 712.26]  the question what does it mean to belong to a church what peter is doing in this letter
[712.26 --> 719.68]  is saying over and over and over again in a variety of ways this is who you are
[719.68 --> 728.96]  this is what you are and what you belong to in this community this is not just a social club this
[728.96 --> 732.66]  is not just a justice community it's not just a community of like-minded individuals you are the
[732.66 --> 737.52]  church and i hope for anyone who's listening this morning or here this morning who's new to the faith
[737.52 --> 746.10]  i hope this passage blows your mind on what it means to be the church because this is not like any
[746.10 --> 752.38]  other community and we must not forget the hugeness that we've been called into in being christians
[752.38 --> 758.46]  so this is where he starts in verse one to three peter actually talks about the distinctive lifestyle
[758.46 --> 764.34]  of the community he says rid yourself of malice and envy and greed this isn't who you are anymore
[764.34 --> 770.34]  he's talking about how they're not like other romans in fact one of the key words in first peter
[770.34 --> 776.84]  in fact he starts by saying to god's elect exiles scattered throughout asia minor and then later he
[776.84 --> 783.54]  says i urge you as foreigners and exiles in your cities to live this way he's basically saying now
[783.54 --> 789.40]  that you belong to jesus you don't quite fit with roman society anymore you're at a sink you're against
[789.40 --> 793.36]  the grain it doesn't sort of fit who you are anymore because you're living out of a different story
[793.36 --> 799.54]  the roman empire isn't your story the caesar being called lord that's not your story that's not your
[799.54 --> 805.62]  faith now you believe in jesus and you're running in this direction following his way against the
[805.62 --> 810.96]  grain of roman culture romans might live a certain way roman culture might be oriented a certain way
[810.96 --> 818.62]  but now you are people who speak truth who live with grace who are trustworthy who love your neighbor
[818.62 --> 827.18]  who love your enemy and malice greed envy slander gossip that's not who you are anymore you're free people
[827.18 --> 832.80]  and underneath what peter is saying is actually really beautiful because peter is looking at this
[832.80 --> 838.20]  young community remember this is mostly recent converse to christian faith he's saying to them
[838.20 --> 843.76]  you've tasted that the lord is good you know he's for you you know he's freed you now you get to grow up
[843.76 --> 849.36]  and experience that and he's assuming that this community has been freed by christ it's full of the
[849.36 --> 855.76]  holy spirit and it will grow he has a sense of confidence as he speaks here and writes to them that this
[855.76 --> 860.76]  community is going to mature and be a faithful witness in their city and that's true by the way
[860.76 --> 866.90]  for the church today the spirit has been given the freedom of christ is here we can grow up and be the
[866.90 --> 875.20]  kind of community that lives distinctively in the next few verses in 5 to 11 he does something really
[875.20 --> 882.50]  creative and very powerful peter associates the life of believers with the life of christ very tightly
[882.50 --> 888.04]  and interestingly by using the imagery of a house and he's pulling on all sorts of old testament imagery
[888.04 --> 894.26]  and if i had more time i'd spend way more time on this but he basically says jesus is the living stone
[894.26 --> 901.64]  you are living stones and i'll just read it for you he says as you come to him the living stone rejected by
[901.64 --> 908.16]  human beings but chosen by god and precious to him you also like living stones are being built into a
[908.16 --> 915.52]  spiritual house now notice the movement jesus is the living stone the cornerstone you are living stones
[915.52 --> 925.60]  jesus was rejected by human beings implicitly you are being rejected by human beings for what you believe
[925.60 --> 936.84]  but he is precious to the father he is the cornerstone so also you as the church are invaluable and precious
[936.84 --> 943.96]  to the father see the movement what is true for christ is true for the church and the church identifies
[943.96 --> 949.82]  with the life of christ including we don't like to talk about this suffering and the church that will
[949.82 --> 954.70]  come after this community he's running to will experience far more suffering as the emperor nero comes in
[954.70 --> 960.68]  and decides that it would be good to light his streets with burning christians it's a sobering thought
[960.68 --> 966.92]  the church identifies with the life of christ he's basically saying you are built in the same family
[966.92 --> 974.16]  jesus is the cornerstone you're the living stones of the spiritual house that god lives in what's true
[974.16 --> 981.40]  for him is true for you jesus suffered you suffer jesus was rejected you rejected jesus died you died with
[981.40 --> 985.90]  him jesus rose you rise with him jesus is glorified you will be glorified with him
[985.90 --> 994.14]  this is a beautiful reality for the church what's true for christ is true for us and what peter says
[994.14 --> 1000.02]  even at the beginning which i can't stop emphasizing these days in a time of coronavirus is that jesus
[1000.02 --> 1006.42]  promises the internal inheritance for those who follow him he holds the hands of the church right
[1006.42 --> 1010.74]  through suffering right through death into resurrection into glory
[1010.74 --> 1022.42]  if identifying with the church or the church with christ and all that christ brings isn't enough
[1022.42 --> 1029.24]  the next few verses paul stacks up more benefits and uses more language to describe the benefits and
[1029.24 --> 1035.22]  the blessings and the privileges of being the body of christ and he uses language that comes from exodus
[1035.22 --> 1040.90]  that comes from the jews in the old testament and is describing them and uh just a helpful frame is
[1040.90 --> 1047.82]  when uh in the old testament when the exodus happened that was the biggest event when god rescued israel
[1047.82 --> 1053.16]  from slavery that was um how one writer says that's the the resurrection of the old testament that's the
[1053.16 --> 1057.06]  biggest thing that happened when the slaves were rescued from egypt and god brought them to himself
[1057.06 --> 1061.88]  he bound them to himself in covenant he became their god they were his people that was the hugest event
[1061.88 --> 1067.36]  that happened and now what peter does he takes all that language all the significance of that he says
[1067.36 --> 1074.22]  that's true for you church in jesus and way more has happened in and through the death and resurrection
[1074.22 --> 1085.84]  so listen to what he says he says to them you are a chosen people a royal priesthood you are a holy nation
[1085.84 --> 1090.94]  god's special possession that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his
[1090.94 --> 1097.76]  wonderful light once you were not a people church but now you're a people once you had not received
[1097.76 --> 1104.26]  mercy but now you've received mercy do you know who you are peter's saying this is what has happened
[1104.26 --> 1112.18]  for you through jesus christ you are the royal priesthood you are the set apart nation you are
[1112.18 --> 1118.28]  the new family that's constituted not by genetics not by blood but by faith in jesus all the blessings
[1118.28 --> 1122.78]  that were promised israel are true for you all the things i said i would do are now yours the
[1122.78 --> 1132.98]  inheritance the presence the power the life are yours and just pause and try to imagine for a moment
[1132.98 --> 1140.34]  being this small little house church in cappadocia and pontus and galatia meeting with 15 brothers and
[1140.34 --> 1145.88]  sisters a ragtag bunch of people who all feel marginalized by society and hearing peter say
[1145.88 --> 1153.32]  that's who you are you're the royal priesthood you're the holy nation you feel marginalized you
[1153.32 --> 1160.80]  belong to god you've received mercy he's called you out of darkness he's made you his receive that
[1160.80 --> 1162.90]  live into that
[1162.90 --> 1171.30]  and that which is true for the first century church is also true for the 21st century church
[1171.30 --> 1178.98]  are you able to hear that for us this morning are we able to actually hear those words as truth for
[1178.98 --> 1188.60]  the church of jesus christ today royal priesthood holy nation god's special possession people who now
[1188.60 --> 1195.42]  have received mercy who live in the freedom of jesus because they believe and have found life
[1195.42 --> 1198.12]  receive that hope
[1198.12 --> 1207.42]  now one of the main emphases of this image of being a spiritual house for peter actually has to do with
[1207.42 --> 1213.92]  being unified the image here is as they draw close to christ they will be drawn close to one another as
[1213.92 --> 1218.20]  a spiritual house and you should so and the old testament again a lot of old testament imagery in this
[1218.20 --> 1223.50]  passage the old testament jews believe israel believed that when god was coming in power he was going to
[1223.50 --> 1229.44]  rebuild the physical temple of jerusalem and both peter and paul they look at the early church and
[1229.44 --> 1235.82]  they say you are the temple you are the stones that are being built into the house that god dwells in by
[1235.82 --> 1243.46]  his spirit to quote paul in ephesians 2 20 you are that building in your very being together as the church
[1243.46 --> 1250.14]  and the assumption is they would learn how to be together as the church as women men slaves free jews
[1250.14 --> 1252.96]  gentiles and all their diversity experience their unity
[1252.96 --> 1263.36]  even the imagery of a stone by the way think about it for a moment a stone is meant for being put onto
[1263.36 --> 1270.08]  a wall and a stone by itself has very little function very little use all by itself stones are
[1270.08 --> 1275.98]  meant to be locked together to create something big together but on their own what's a stone not very
[1275.98 --> 1281.54]  useful at least not in my opinion in the west i want to highlight this because this is our reality
[1281.54 --> 1288.52]  unlike the first century church we can easily conceive of being christians without being in a church
[1288.52 --> 1293.32]  in fact a lot of us when we think of being christian we might not even first think about being part of
[1293.32 --> 1298.22]  a believing community we think of sort of my own relationship with christ my own devotional life
[1298.22 --> 1303.84]  my own prayer life however you conceive it it's easy for us in an individualistic culture to think of our
[1303.84 --> 1310.50]  faith life as an individual individualistic thing that's not how it goes and i think if peter were
[1310.50 --> 1319.18]  to write this letter to the church today he would be hammering this point home you can't thrive by
[1319.18 --> 1326.82]  yourself you need to belong to the body you're a stone that belongs to the wall and that wall is the
[1326.82 --> 1334.16]  family of jesus christ you need them and they need you are you hearing this this is an important word
[1334.16 --> 1342.02]  for the church in the west right now even during covid you need the body i want to share two stories
[1342.02 --> 1346.08]  that i think reinforce this well the first is i heard this years ago and i may have even shared it
[1346.08 --> 1351.92]  it's of a young man who is feeling very far from christ distant in his face struggling with what he
[1351.92 --> 1357.02]  believes and so he went to visit his pastor visits his pastor at night and the pastor sitting by a
[1357.02 --> 1362.48]  fire it's an open fire on a hearth those were good days i grew up with a fire i just love real fires
[1362.48 --> 1367.80]  anyway visiting his power is visiting his pastor they're sitting together in front of the fire and
[1367.80 --> 1372.94]  he's sharing his story he feels distant from the church disconnected from christ he's feeling far and
[1372.94 --> 1379.72]  just lost in his life and the pastor says nothing to him what he does is with the tongs he takes one of
[1379.72 --> 1385.54]  the red coals from the embers in the fire takes it out of the fire puts it on the stone hearth in front
[1385.54 --> 1392.86]  of the fire and together they just watch that little red ember slowly fade dark orange then to gray and
[1392.86 --> 1400.32]  then black and then without saying a word the pastor takes the tongs puts that coal back in the fire and
[1400.32 --> 1405.72]  they both watch as the fire and the heat and the redness can return to that little coal as it's with the
[1405.72 --> 1413.14]  rest and the point was clear disassociated and disconnected from the body you lose your heat
[1413.14 --> 1421.54]  you lose your fire for christ and his word and the gospel but in that community of people you maintain
[1421.54 --> 1429.10]  the heat and the passion for christ and his life related to that when i was in my fourth year university
[1429.10 --> 1434.60]  my professor one of my favorite professors he gave me a piece of art and i promptly lost it i actually
[1434.60 --> 1439.20]  looked quite heavily for it when we moved here and i never found it but this big it was a chalk drawing
[1439.20 --> 1444.64]  and had two halves to it i'll describe it to you on the one half it showed a dragon figure it was sort
[1444.64 --> 1450.28]  of it wasn't a uh what's the word sort of impressionistic sorry for art people i'm terrible
[1450.28 --> 1456.06]  at this and it showed a dragon bearing down on an individual holding a sword running away that's the
[1456.06 --> 1462.22]  one half the other half showed a community of people chasing together that very dragon it's almost out
[1462.22 --> 1468.16]  of the scene the caption underneath the first half where the dragon was chasing was disconnected
[1468.16 --> 1476.48]  individualism the caption under the second half was faithful community what i like about that piece
[1476.48 --> 1481.98]  of art was specifically the way in which it describes spiritual attack and demonic attack this idea that
[1481.98 --> 1488.26]  temptation and satan's devices remember he's a roaring lion ready to pounce that when we are on our own
[1488.26 --> 1495.60]  disconnected trying to live out our faith we're toast do you know that we don't have a chance
[1495.60 --> 1502.14]  facing all the schemes and all the temptations not to mention our own broken burden sinful hearts we don't
[1502.14 --> 1509.44]  have a chance of growing and thriving and following christ on our own we are pounced but in community
[1509.44 --> 1515.42]  there is strength where the spirit dwells and almost every time by the way just so i say this
[1515.42 --> 1519.76]  almost every time the spirit is talked about in the new testament with the exception of two or three
[1519.76 --> 1526.12]  it's always talked about on a community not just individuals only a few times does it describe the body
[1526.12 --> 1530.94]  of the individual as the residence of the holy spirit it's the community where the power and the life of
[1530.94 --> 1535.40]  the spirit is felt and when the community is working together growing reading the scriptures praying
[1535.40 --> 1542.18]  encouraging that's where the power and the victory is gained and i'm convinced that a lot of us this
[1542.18 --> 1552.34]  morning we're feeling the loss of disconnected individualism and i know it's been a hard season for a lot of us
[1552.34 --> 1561.92]  and i want to say as much as i can we need to be creative and very intentional about remaining bricks who are
[1561.92 --> 1569.86]  connected in the body of christ we need to be very creative and intentional about reaching out and receiving the gift
[1569.86 --> 1577.40]  of community and i know it's weird i mean we think and talk a lot at a staff level about how do we do
[1577.40 --> 1582.58]  church right now and i'm convinced we don't need to think big and grandiose just not possible right now
[1582.58 --> 1592.32]  but we need to think very small about that person that family that couple that friend who you haven't seen
[1592.32 --> 1597.28]  and i've been surprised i've been listening over the last six months as people pick up the phone
[1597.28 --> 1601.90]  or they say let's go meet somewhere they grab a coffee or they sit in chairs in the backyard
[1601.90 --> 1606.94]  they're amazed by what people share and how they need to catch up and what there is to pray for and
[1606.94 --> 1613.98]  how they're receiving the blessing of community don't be surprised when you take those baby steps of
[1613.98 --> 1617.24]  picking up your phone and calling that person who the spirit has been putting in your heart when
[1617.24 --> 1620.80]  ministry and encouragement and growth happens
[1620.80 --> 1629.50]  several times as i prepared my sermon the passage from hebrews 10 came to mind and i'll read it for you
[1629.50 --> 1637.26]  let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess for he who promised is faithful and let us consider
[1637.26 --> 1644.04]  how we might spur one another on towards love and good deeds not giving up meeting together as some
[1644.04 --> 1651.20]  are in the habit of doing but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day approaching
[1651.20 --> 1659.04]  and hebrews just like first peter is a book written to people who are struggling in this massive oppressive
[1659.04 --> 1669.48]  roman empire and these churches they need the family of christ to stay faithful to stay growing
[1669.48 --> 1674.66]  to grow up in their faith to be the presence of christ in their city
[1674.66 --> 1683.66]  we can't read this passage without also seeing that everything peter is describing about the church
[1683.66 --> 1689.04]  about being god's special possession about being god's priestly nation about being them set apart
[1689.04 --> 1694.92]  that all of that is to be lived before the watching world this is not some separate enclave this is not
[1694.92 --> 1699.26]  just some community that just enjoys the benefits of god all on their own and lives their own little
[1699.26 --> 1704.86]  segregated life it's all for the city even when he says he's called you out of darkness into his
[1704.86 --> 1710.46]  wonderful light so what so that you can declare the praises of him who called you into that light
[1710.46 --> 1715.18]  and when it describes the declaring praises yes it's talking about corporate worship but it's talking
[1715.18 --> 1721.36]  about the whole of life as worship from being with your neighbors to being with your friends to
[1721.36 --> 1727.96]  working in the city that too is worship and he puts a real fine point on it in verse 11 and 12 when
[1727.96 --> 1734.44]  peter says dear friends i urge you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from the sinful desires that
[1734.44 --> 1742.58]  war against your souls live such good lives among the pagans that what though they accuse you of doing
[1742.58 --> 1747.26]  wrong and by the way that accusation was probably the strangeness of what they believed and how they
[1747.26 --> 1753.16]  lived out their faith they will see your good deeds and glorify god on the day he visits us
[1753.16 --> 1759.84]  do you see what peter is envisioning there peter is envisioning this tiny again small little house
[1759.84 --> 1765.94]  churches living out their faith baby steps of faithfulness small acts of kindness speaking the
[1765.94 --> 1772.64]  words of life and as they do that christ works through the church to bring about faith in neighbors
[1772.64 --> 1778.90]  friends family members cousins etc such that when god returns in power to restore all things
[1778.90 --> 1783.76]  more people will be glorifying his name ready for his return through the mission of the church
[1783.76 --> 1790.10]  that's what peter imagines through these small house churches and my prayer is that we have a vision for
[1790.10 --> 1801.20]  what that looks like even in our community right here in clayton today so to summarize we are the church
[1801.20 --> 1808.52]  we are not a social club we are not just a gathering of like-minded religious people who have some sort of
[1808.52 --> 1814.62]  weakness and need to talk to a god we belong to the creator of heaven and earth do you believe that
[1814.62 --> 1822.88]  we have been freed through the death and resurrection of jesus christ to live fully human lives
[1822.88 --> 1833.94]  you and i have been filled with the holy spirit he's here in our midst dwelling among us so that we can grow
[1833.94 --> 1843.84]  and experience the joy of our salvation and we belong to a church that is sent to invite the whole world
[1843.84 --> 1856.78]  into that freedom that's the church we belong to amen and i hope and pray that you get the chance
[1856.78 --> 1863.18]  to sit on that bench or at the coffee table at work or in the neighborhood and share this is why
[1863.18 --> 1872.70]  i belong to the church let's pray father we thank you so much that you've grafted us into this body
[1872.70 --> 1878.88]  and we celebrate that this body goes far beyond just this gathering this morning but to churches
[1878.88 --> 1884.30]  across the city to churches across the globe we praise you for the family that you've brought us into
[1884.30 --> 1892.22]  we ask for hearts that can receive the blessings we pray for the ability to know that in christ we are
[1892.22 --> 1901.46]  free people we are forgiven people we have been made right with you through jesus christ help us lord to
[1901.46 --> 1908.88]  see and believe that and lord we pray that we learn how to be living stones who are built together in
[1908.88 --> 1916.20]  unity and that our words and our deeds our baby steps of faithfulness would lead to conversion and
[1916.20 --> 1921.08]  transformation in our city to that end lord would you fill us with your spirit
[1921.08 --> 1928.84]  would you move in our lives and use us to bring about your blessing we pray this all in the name of
[1928.84 --> 1930.82]  jesus christ our lord amen
[1930.82 --> 1940.20]  peter spoke of jesus being the cornerstone and now we can sing to christ our cornerstone let's sing
[1940.20 --> 1941.40]  stand as we worship
[1941.40 --> 1949.94]  you
[1949.94 --> 1951.94]  you
[1951.94 --> 1953.94]  you
[1953.94 --> 1955.94]  you
[1955.94 --> 1957.94]  you
[1957.94 --> 1959.94]  you
[1959.94 --> 1961.94]  you
[1961.94 --> 1963.94]  you
[1963.94 --> 1965.94]  you
