[0.00 → 6.56] Well, good morning, Hope.
[8.24 → 11.74] It's good to gather around God's Word again this morning
[11.74 → 15.72] and listen to what Christ has to say to the church today
[15.72 → 20.30] as we listen to what God says to His church in Thessalonica.
[21.46 → 24.10] And Val, I just want to thank you for the way that your prayer opened us up
[24.10 → 27.50] to our global body and the needs in our world.
[27.50 → 30.58] And in some sense, that really helps us understand a little bit
[30.58 → 32.20] about what we're going to talk about this morning.
[32.78 → 36.88] Last week, Pastor Sid preached on how to face death
[36.88 → 38.46] and believers who have died.
[39.08 → 42.88] And this week, they're asking another question about this coming day of the Lord.
[43.10 → 46.98] And so if you have your Bible, turn with me to 1 Thessalonians 5,
[47.36 → 49.28] and we'll read starting at verse 1.
[49.28 → 58.88] Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates, we do not need to write to you,
[59.26 → 63.54] for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
[64.20 → 66.34] While people are saying, peace and safety,
[66.92 → 70.64] destruction will come on them suddenly as labour pains on a pregnant woman,
[70.92 → 72.82] and they will not escape.
[73.52 → 75.90] But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness,
[75.90 → 78.10] so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
[78.72 → 81.98] You are all children of the light and children of the day.
[82.64 → 84.74] We do not belong to the night or the darkness.
[85.52 → 88.46] So then let us not be like others who are asleep,
[88.90 → 90.94] but let us be awake and sober.
[91.62 → 93.40] For those who sleep, sleep at night,
[93.50 → 95.48] and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.
[95.68 → 98.62] But since we belong to the day, let us be sober,
[99.28 → 101.68] putting on faith and love as a breastplate,
[101.68 → 103.60] and hope as a salvation helmet.
[104.40 → 106.60] For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath,
[106.96 → 110.30] but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[111.00 → 112.36] He died for us,
[112.54 → 114.64] so that whether we are awake or asleep,
[114.94 → 117.06] we may live together with Him.
[117.86 → 120.24] Therefore, encourage one another and build each other up,
[120.50 → 122.84] just as in fact you are doing.
[122.84 → 132.44] Well, one of the unique things about living in a Western culture like we do,
[132.78 → 133.58] at least to me,
[134.20 → 137.48] is that we live in the here and in the now.
[138.20 → 140.18] Our culture, whether you're aware of it or not,
[140.22 → 141.94] is a present tense culture.
[142.46 → 144.72] We are preoccupied with right now,
[144.98 → 146.28] what's happening right at this moment.
[146.40 → 148.98] We're not that concerned about the past.
[148.98 → 153.86] We don't talk much or reflect much on what's happening in the future.
[154.14 → 156.56] It's all about the moment.
[156.74 → 157.44] Have you noticed that?
[158.54 → 161.24] Until, of course, some crisis happens
[161.24 → 163.30] that forces you and forces me
[163.30 → 165.08] to think about these bigger questions of history
[165.08 → 166.48] and the meaning of life.
[166.86 → 170.20] Crises like a pandemic or a funeral.
[171.00 → 174.30] I've found that there's nothing like a funeral
[174.30 → 178.42] to force people to ask those bigger questions about their life,
[178.42 → 179.90] the meaning of life,
[180.28 → 181.40] where everything's going,
[181.78 → 184.80] and how to live in the short lives that we have.
[185.66 → 186.90] Perhaps you know what I'm talking about,
[186.94 → 188.26] where you sit at a funeral
[188.26 → 189.56] and you watch the slideshow
[189.56 → 190.46] and you hear the speeches
[190.46 → 192.46] and you hear those passages about death
[192.46 → 193.50] and the resurrection.
[193.70 → 193.94] You think,
[194.34 → 196.70] what am I going to make of my own life?
[198.26 → 199.92] One of the things I love
[199.92 → 202.24] about this little church in Thessalonica
[202.24 → 205.74] is that they don't preoccupy themselves
[205.74 → 208.14] with the immediate moment like we do.
[208.68 → 210.62] They're asking Paul these huge questions
[210.62 → 213.56] about death and what happens to believers when they die.
[213.64 → 215.20] And as soon as Paul instructs them about that,
[215.44 → 217.84] they seem to have questions about the day of the Lord,
[217.94 → 218.22] this future,
[218.98 → 221.68] what's God doing with all history?
[222.06 → 224.40] Where is he taking everything that's happening?
[225.26 → 227.32] We don't talk about that in the West.
[227.90 → 229.02] But they're asking Paul,
[229.02 → 231.38] what's coming for humanity?
[231.76 → 234.00] And how do we live in light of what's coming?
[234.10 → 235.42] And so Paul instructs them
[235.42 → 238.40] on this thing we call the day of the Lord.
[238.82 → 241.12] Let me read to you how Paul starts our passage again.
[241.22 → 241.42] He says,
[241.48 → 242.32] Brothers and sisters,
[243.18 → 245.40] about times and dates we do not need to write you,
[245.52 → 247.18] for you know very well
[247.18 → 249.24] that the day of the Lord will come
[249.24 → 250.54] like a thief in the night.
[252.58 → 254.00] Now this word, day of the Lord,
[254.08 → 255.80] this phrase is a loaded phrase.
[255.86 → 256.42] And I'm curious,
[256.42 → 257.66] I wish I could ask you,
[257.74 → 259.14] what's popping up in your head
[259.14 → 261.12] even as you hear day of the Lord?
[262.26 → 263.86] First century Jewish people
[263.86 → 265.46] and even Jewish people before them
[265.46 → 266.66] had a very clear sense
[266.66 → 268.88] of what that phrase meant.
[269.02 → 269.22] You see,
[269.30 → 271.28] they saw the world in sort of two frames,
[271.42 → 272.16] two epochs.
[272.64 → 274.14] There was the present age
[274.14 → 276.26] and there was the age to come.
[276.86 → 277.86] The present age,
[277.96 → 278.82] we know something about.
[278.90 → 280.04] It was the age of evil,
[280.22 → 280.68] of sin,
[280.78 → 281.24] of misery,
[281.38 → 281.94] of violence,
[282.02 → 282.48] and death.
[282.74 → 284.00] And the age to come
[284.00 → 285.74] was the age of righteousness
[285.74 → 286.76] and justice
[286.76 → 287.98] and God's love
[287.98 → 288.64] filled the earth
[288.64 → 289.84] and there was no more evil,
[290.00 → 290.72] no more pain.
[291.48 → 292.20] It was shalom.
[293.48 → 294.44] The old age
[294.44 → 295.70] and the new age.
[296.06 → 297.36] And what would happen
[297.36 → 298.86] in order for the world
[298.86 → 299.64] to experience
[299.64 → 301.32] this age to come
[301.32 → 302.62] was the day of the Lord.
[303.28 → 304.26] That's when God
[304.26 → 304.92] was going to show up
[304.92 → 305.44] in power
[305.44 → 306.06] and glory
[306.06 → 306.64] and judgment.
[306.94 → 308.06] He would put away oppression,
[308.22 → 309.18] He would put away violence,
[309.40 → 310.46] He would deal with evil,
[310.60 → 311.74] and He would establish
[311.74 → 313.28] His kingdom forever,
[313.42 → 314.22] that age to come.
[314.22 → 316.72] That's how they saw
[316.72 → 317.58] the old age,
[317.66 → 318.30] the new age,
[318.50 → 320.00] and the day of the Lord
[320.00 → 321.22] that brought an end
[321.22 → 321.82] to the old
[321.82 → 322.44] and the beginning
[322.44 → 323.00] of the new.
[324.20 → 325.34] And what made Jesus,
[325.46 → 326.36] this is an important point,
[326.64 → 327.26] what made Jesus
[327.26 → 328.36] so confusing
[328.36 → 330.04] to Jewish people
[330.04 → 330.74] in the first century
[330.74 → 331.60] is number one,
[332.64 → 333.60] He suffered and died
[333.60 → 334.18] on a cross.
[334.30 → 335.24] They imagined God
[335.24 → 336.14] coming in judgment
[336.14 → 336.84] and power
[336.84 → 337.66] and here they look
[337.66 → 338.16] at this quote
[338.16 → 339.08] Messiah figure
[339.08 → 340.10] dealing
[340.10 → 341.34] and being dealt
[341.34 → 342.00] the violence
[342.00 → 342.64] and the oppression
[342.64 → 343.36] and the evil
[343.36 → 344.02] and dying
[344.02 → 345.70] a sinner's death.
[346.52 → 347.80] That didn't fit the mould.
[348.64 → 349.44] But secondly,
[350.00 → 350.78] they could never
[350.78 → 351.34] have imagined
[351.34 → 352.78] that that age to come
[352.78 → 354.44] would arrive
[354.44 → 356.08] in a small way
[356.08 → 357.40] and not in its fullness.
[357.62 → 357.84] In fact,
[357.90 → 358.48] that's what Paul
[358.48 → 359.08] struggled with
[359.08 → 359.46] when he tried
[359.46 → 360.24] to make sense of Jesus.
[360.36 → 360.66] He said,
[360.98 → 361.96] when the Messiah comes,
[362.36 → 363.24] the age to come
[363.24 → 363.98] will be ushered in
[363.98 → 364.48] in its fullness
[364.48 → 365.54] and then Jesus rises
[365.54 → 366.04] from the dead,
[366.10 → 366.58] He ascends to be
[366.58 → 367.08] with the Father
[367.08 → 368.16] and guess who still
[368.16 → 368.84] sits on the throne
[368.84 → 369.72] of his own city?
[370.26 → 370.76] The Caesar
[370.76 → 372.46] and all of his violence.
[373.90 → 375.00] There's this overlapping
[375.00 → 375.78] of the ages
[375.78 → 377.44] that made it hard
[377.44 → 378.40] for people to understand
[378.40 → 379.82] who Jesus was
[379.82 → 380.68] and so that's why
[380.68 → 381.50] we talk about
[381.50 → 382.64] this already,
[382.80 → 383.10] not yet.
[383.16 → 383.86] If you heard Sid
[383.86 → 384.60] preaching last week,
[384.64 → 385.02] he talked about
[385.02 → 386.00] how we live in this already.
[386.12 → 386.68] The age to come
[386.68 → 387.30] is already here
[387.30 → 388.28] through Jesus' resurrection
[388.28 → 389.16] and the outpouring
[389.16 → 389.68] of the Spirit
[389.68 → 391.60] but we still live
[391.60 → 393.06] in that old age
[393.06 → 393.72] with suffering
[393.72 → 394.26] and evil
[394.26 → 395.00] and violence
[395.00 → 395.68] and pain.
[395.68 → 397.96] But when the New Testament
[397.96 → 398.80] writers now
[398.80 → 399.96] talk about the day
[399.96 → 400.50] of the Lord,
[400.74 → 401.88] they're not just looking back
[401.88 → 402.54] at what Jesus did
[402.54 → 403.22] on the cross,
[403.46 → 404.56] they're looking forward
[404.56 → 406.20] to Jesus' return
[406.20 → 408.10] which Jesus himself promised
[408.10 → 409.44] saying He's going to return
[409.44 → 410.80] to judge the living
[410.80 → 411.76] and the dead
[411.76 → 413.60] and after that happens
[413.60 → 414.62] He will establish
[414.62 → 416.18] His kingdom here forever.
[417.64 → 418.78] The day of the Lord
[418.78 → 420.00] was that day
[420.00 → 421.14] of judgment.
[422.04 → 422.74] Now I want to say
[422.74 → 423.58] something very clearly
[423.58 → 424.26] right up front
[424.26 → 425.02] as we think about
[425.02 → 425.86] this passage
[425.86 → 426.94] and that is that
[426.94 → 427.74] Western people,
[427.96 → 428.62] Western Christians,
[429.16 → 429.92] we get a little bit
[429.92 → 430.40] uncomfortable
[430.40 → 431.88] when we talk about judgment.
[432.72 → 433.30] Maybe some of you
[433.30 → 433.76] right now
[433.76 → 434.48] as I talk about
[434.48 → 435.78] Jesus coming as a judge
[435.78 → 436.36] it makes you
[436.36 → 437.58] wince a little bit.
[438.32 → 439.10] There are lots of reasons
[439.10 → 439.44] for that.
[439.52 → 440.12] I think two of them
[440.12 → 440.58] are one,
[441.00 → 442.38] we live in a hyper-tolerant
[442.38 → 442.74] culture
[442.74 → 445.00] and we don't judge anything.
[445.12 → 445.38] In fact,
[445.64 → 446.36] the J word
[446.36 → 447.50] is worse than other words.
[447.62 → 448.42] No one wants to be
[448.42 → 449.36] a judge,
[449.50 → 450.74] a judgmental person.
[451.76 → 452.18] Secondly,
[452.34 → 453.30] I think some of us
[453.30 → 454.04] probably grew up
[454.04 → 454.58] in traditions
[454.58 → 455.46] and church traditions
[455.46 → 456.62] that emphasize
[456.62 → 457.84] hell and judgment
[457.84 → 458.76] so much
[458.76 → 459.48] that it almost
[459.48 → 460.68] feared people
[460.68 → 461.84] into faith
[461.84 → 463.24] rather than the good news
[463.24 → 463.74] of what Jesus
[463.74 → 464.42] has accomplished.
[464.98 → 465.52] And there's now
[465.52 → 466.54] a sort of reaction
[466.54 → 467.58] against that old
[467.58 → 468.32] way of preaching
[468.32 → 469.28] where we just
[469.28 → 470.56] don't talk about it.
[471.60 → 472.32] But let me be clear,
[472.46 → 473.42] you can't read
[473.42 → 474.22] the New Testament
[474.22 → 475.82] without hearing
[475.82 → 476.76] the day of the Lord
[476.76 → 477.38] and judgment
[477.38 → 478.34] mentioned a lot.
[478.42 → 478.68] In fact,
[478.72 → 479.22] if you want to do
[479.22 → 479.82] a word study
[479.82 → 480.30] on judgment,
[480.70 → 480.96] do it
[480.96 → 481.40] because you'll see
[481.40 → 482.60] how Jesus talks about it,
[482.60 → 483.64] Paul talks about it,
[483.72 → 484.54] Peter talks about it,
[484.58 → 485.74] Revelation talks about it,
[485.86 → 486.70] it's all over.
[487.66 → 488.68] More than that,
[488.90 → 489.78] in the New Testament,
[490.06 → 490.62] when judgment
[490.62 → 491.38] is talked about,
[491.88 → 492.90] it's good news.
[494.58 → 495.66] Any guess why?
[497.00 → 498.30] When Jesus comes
[498.30 → 499.00] as the judge
[499.00 → 499.54] of the living
[499.54 → 500.06] and the dead,
[500.46 → 501.28] that means
[501.28 → 501.86] oppression
[501.86 → 503.16] and violence
[503.16 → 504.00] and evil
[504.00 → 505.30] and corrupt systems
[505.30 → 505.92] and hatred
[505.92 → 508.44] are finally gone.
[509.88 → 510.96] That's good news.
[510.96 → 511.86] Yes,
[511.94 → 512.78] there are pieces of it
[512.78 → 513.24] that make us
[513.24 → 513.80] uncomfortable thinking,
[513.96 → 514.52] how is Jesus
[514.52 → 515.06] going to judge?
[515.18 → 515.60] What's it going
[515.60 → 516.12] to look like?
[516.26 → 517.22] We all try to imagine
[517.22 → 517.72] that future,
[518.06 → 518.78] but for believers
[518.78 → 519.68] throughout history
[519.68 → 520.76] and New Testament writers,
[521.24 → 522.30] this was the time
[522.30 → 523.08] where God would
[523.08 → 524.98] finally put an end
[524.98 → 527.02] to all that makes
[527.02 → 528.70] our world a mess.
[529.46 → 529.78] And Val,
[529.82 → 530.70] I just want to acknowledge
[530.70 → 532.00] how good it was
[532.00 → 533.56] to pray for the countries
[533.56 → 534.20] that are going through
[534.20 → 535.00] turmoil this morning
[535.00 → 535.62] and recognizing
[535.62 → 536.96] our world is not
[536.96 → 537.70] as it should be
[537.70 → 539.12] and we need
[539.12 → 539.92] a just,
[540.32 → 541.38] loving judge
[541.38 → 542.24] to deal with
[542.24 → 543.04] what is a mess.
[545.88 → 546.36] Now,
[546.44 → 546.94] Christian writers
[546.94 → 547.60] throughout history,
[548.16 → 549.24] as they grapple
[549.24 → 550.94] with Jesus being a judge,
[551.44 → 552.34] have all landed
[552.34 → 553.26] more or less
[553.26 → 554.00] in the same way.
[554.68 → 555.30] They've realized
[555.30 → 556.24] that Jesus wouldn't
[556.24 → 557.44] be much of a God
[557.44 → 557.96] to worship
[557.96 → 559.38] if he couldn't judge
[559.38 → 560.88] evil and violence
[560.88 → 561.44] and corruption.
[561.80 → 562.40] Just imagine
[562.40 → 562.82] for a moment
[562.82 → 563.48] that Jesus didn't
[563.48 → 564.14] have the power
[564.14 → 565.52] or the ability
[565.52 → 566.50] to deal with
[566.50 → 567.12] all that makes
[567.12 → 567.54] our world
[567.54 → 568.32] what it is now.
[569.00 → 569.72] Imagine we just
[569.72 → 570.46] had to permanently
[570.46 → 571.80] and perpetually forever
[571.80 → 573.54] tolerate oppression,
[574.34 → 575.14] corrupt governments,
[575.58 → 576.96] policies that abuse
[576.96 → 577.60] and dehumanize.
[577.64 → 578.18] We just had to live
[578.18 → 578.98] with that forever.
[579.50 → 580.54] What kind of God
[580.54 → 581.42] would Jesus be
[581.42 → 582.68] if that's all
[582.68 → 583.40] he offered us?
[583.42 → 584.86] Just keep tolerating it.
[585.64 → 586.68] Just keep living with it.
[587.20 → 587.90] That's your hope
[587.90 → 588.46] for the future.
[589.74 → 590.64] And Miroslaw Golf,
[591.58 → 592.38] an academic
[592.38 → 593.80] and also a believer,
[593.80 → 595.40] he struggled quite
[595.40 → 596.76] personally and academically
[596.76 → 599.18] with Jesus as a judge
[599.18 → 600.18] and God's wrath
[600.18 → 601.00] and God's love
[601.00 → 601.60] and what to make
[601.60 → 602.22] of his character.
[602.64 → 603.26] And I want to read
[603.26 → 603.86] for you a quote
[603.86 → 605.20] that I think captures
[605.20 → 606.18] a big piece
[606.18 → 607.06] of where the New Testament
[607.06 → 608.08] lands when it talks
[608.08 → 609.12] about Jesus coming
[609.12 → 609.60] as judge.
[609.68 → 610.50] This is what he writes.
[611.10 → 612.64] Though I used to complain
[612.64 → 614.88] about the indecency
[614.88 → 615.84] of the idea
[615.84 → 616.84] of God's wrath,
[617.08 → 618.02] I came to think
[618.02 → 618.94] that I would have
[618.94 → 619.74] to rebel
[619.74 → 621.04] against a God
[621.04 → 622.68] who wasn't wrathful
[622.68 → 623.36] in the sight
[623.36 → 624.28] of the world's evil.
[625.26 → 626.60] God isn't wrathful
[626.60 → 628.32] in spite of being love.
[629.04 → 629.96] God is wrathful
[629.96 → 632.60] because God is love.
[632.70 → 633.46] Did you catch that?
[634.74 → 635.94] He judges evil
[635.94 → 636.56] and oppression
[636.56 → 637.76] because he loves
[637.76 → 638.52] his world
[638.52 → 639.60] and his people
[639.60 → 640.76] too much
[640.76 → 641.70] to let evil
[641.70 → 642.64] go on forever.
[643.94 → 644.70] And the day
[644.70 → 645.52] of Jesus coming
[645.52 → 646.30] as judge
[646.30 → 647.26] is the day
[647.26 → 648.06] of God saying,
[648.66 → 649.18] enough.
[649.18 → 651.44] Now my kingdom
[651.44 → 652.38] of peace comes
[652.38 → 653.52] and oppression
[653.52 → 654.40] is done away with.
[654.92 → 656.32] And that for the New Testament
[656.32 → 657.96] is good news.
[660.14 → 661.22] Paul is saying,
[662.08 → 662.78] there is a day
[662.78 → 664.00] on God's calendar
[664.00 → 666.16] where that enough moment
[666.16 → 667.36] and the banishing
[667.36 → 668.32] of all opposition
[668.32 → 669.06] to his kingdom,
[669.46 → 669.90] the banishing
[669.90 → 670.80] of all oppression
[670.80 → 671.78] will happen.
[672.46 → 672.88] And I think
[672.88 → 674.06] the way we understand
[674.06 → 674.94] that has to do
[674.94 → 675.86] a lot with our own
[675.86 → 677.16] situation in life
[677.16 → 678.08] and our own location
[678.08 → 678.98] in life.
[679.28 → 680.00] And by that I mean
[680.00 → 680.90] if you are someone
[680.90 → 681.84] who is oppressed
[681.84 → 683.42] or poor
[683.42 → 685.16] or if there are bombs
[685.16 → 686.40] flying over your city
[686.40 → 687.66] and you've lost loved ones
[687.66 → 688.24] due to war,
[688.80 → 689.52] the day of the Lord
[689.52 → 690.20] is good news,
[690.26 → 690.76] wouldn't you say?
[691.78 → 692.58] But if you're someone
[692.58 → 693.22] who's oppressing
[693.22 → 694.96] and you're dehumanizing
[694.96 → 695.78] and abusing others,
[695.86 → 696.40] the day of the Lord
[696.40 → 697.74] is bad news.
[698.50 → 699.48] And there's no avoiding
[699.48 → 700.60] that point in our passage.
[701.98 → 703.68] And the New Testament believers
[703.68 → 705.20] and many of the believers
[705.20 → 706.26] in these small churches,
[706.26 → 708.30] they were oppressed.
[709.04 → 710.16] They were persecuted.
[710.32 → 710.98] And as we've mentioned,
[711.38 → 712.46] there are likely believers
[712.46 → 713.14] in this church
[713.14 → 714.02] who were killed
[714.02 → 715.68] for their faith.
[716.38 → 717.32] And the words we see
[717.32 → 718.18] in Revelation are,
[718.80 → 719.96] how long, Lord?
[720.76 → 722.36] How long will you tolerate
[722.36 → 723.44] this oppression?
[724.20 → 726.68] Come, bring your kingdom.
[727.74 → 728.52] Heal your world.
[730.60 → 731.60] The question
[731.60 → 732.96] that the believers
[732.96 → 734.24] in Thessalonians were asking,
[734.44 → 735.58] a question we all ask,
[735.58 → 737.12] is when?
[737.76 → 738.64] The very human thing.
[738.76 → 740.08] Okay, when's the day
[740.08 → 740.74] of the Lord coming?
[740.86 → 742.14] When is Jesus coming back
[742.14 → 742.44] in power?
[742.58 → 743.34] When is this judgment
[743.34 → 743.86] going to happen?
[744.10 → 744.64] Have you ever asked
[744.64 → 745.12] that question?
[746.48 → 747.28] I've had people say,
[747.36 → 748.16] it's got to be coming soon.
[748.24 → 749.04] Things are getting crazy.
[750.10 → 750.80] The when question,
[750.90 → 752.02] and Paul says to them,
[752.68 → 753.40] that's not for us
[753.40 → 754.02] to talk about.
[754.28 → 754.86] And he's just echoing
[754.86 → 755.50] what Jesus said,
[755.56 → 755.86] by the way,
[755.92 → 756.80] when Jesus was asked
[756.80 → 758.00] about when God's coming back
[758.00 → 758.70] and when he's returning,
[758.78 → 759.34] you know what he said?
[759.94 → 761.22] Really deep theology here.
[761.82 → 762.74] I don't know.
[762.74 → 765.10] Only the Father knows
[765.10 → 766.46] by his appointed authority.
[766.80 → 767.46] I don't know.
[767.54 → 768.40] And I think the subtext
[768.40 → 769.94] of that for any current person
[769.94 → 771.70] is maybe you should stop
[771.70 → 772.92] trying to figure it out.
[773.68 → 774.50] Maybe you should stop
[774.50 → 774.96] trying to say,
[775.08 → 776.20] it could be May 2020
[776.20 → 777.80] or August 1970
[777.80 → 778.80] or all the thousands
[778.80 → 779.22] of predictions
[779.22 → 779.86] that have been made.
[780.08 → 780.96] We don't know.
[781.62 → 782.08] And instead,
[782.20 → 782.92] what Paul does
[782.92 → 783.66] is he says,
[783.90 → 785.50] here's what Jesus himself taught
[785.50 → 786.50] and what I want to reiterate.
[786.50 → 787.22] Number one,
[787.54 → 788.20] it's coming.
[789.20 → 789.90] Number two,
[789.98 → 790.90] it's going to be a surprise.
[791.46 → 792.06] Number three,
[792.36 → 792.88] be ready.
[793.94 → 794.82] And the two images
[794.82 → 795.96] Paul starts with are,
[796.36 → 797.50] Jesus coming will be like
[797.50 → 798.52] a thief in the night
[798.52 → 800.26] and like a child being born.
[801.06 → 801.26] Now,
[801.34 → 801.86] has anyone here
[801.86 → 802.52] been broken into?
[804.22 → 804.96] Did you know
[804.96 → 805.60] it was going to happen?
[806.76 → 807.40] There you go.
[807.84 → 808.74] It's a surprise.
[808.90 → 809.50] That's the point.
[810.06 → 810.24] Now,
[810.30 → 810.90] I'm more struck
[810.90 → 811.90] by Paul's image
[811.90 → 813.48] of a child being born
[813.48 → 814.92] as this coming of Jesus.
[815.60 → 815.80] Now,
[815.80 → 816.48] Brittany and I
[816.48 → 817.18] have four kids
[817.18 → 818.70] and I still know nothing
[818.70 → 819.50] about childbirth
[819.50 → 820.92] because I'm a fainter
[820.92 → 821.60] and I do everything
[821.60 → 822.36] in my power
[822.36 → 823.22] to avoid
[823.22 → 824.70] the event of childbirth.
[824.90 → 825.62] Don't judge me.
[825.94 → 826.84] I was born
[826.84 → 827.66] for like the 50s
[827.66 → 828.22] where you could drop
[828.22 → 828.90] your wife off
[828.90 → 829.46] at the hospital,
[829.64 → 830.38] go back to work.
[830.70 → 831.42] They would call you
[831.42 → 832.14] to say if it was a boy
[832.14 → 832.50] or a girl
[832.50 → 833.14] and then you'd go
[833.14 → 834.36] and you'd not have to faint.
[835.04 → 835.78] And if you're judging me,
[835.84 → 836.12] remember,
[836.26 → 836.96] you're not a fainter.
[838.06 → 838.96] But what I do know
[838.96 → 839.62] a little bit about
[839.62 → 840.38] in that image
[840.38 → 842.14] is the readiness.
[843.30 → 844.34] One of my greatest fears
[844.34 → 845.96] is a home birth.
[846.58 → 847.22] I still don't know
[847.22 → 848.16] why people choose
[848.16 → 848.78] home births
[848.78 → 849.38] in a day when they have
[849.38 → 850.70] these glorious hospitals
[850.70 → 852.36] ready to help you
[852.36 → 853.82] and take care of you.
[854.34 → 855.04] Different conversation.
[855.20 → 855.80] But there are times
[855.80 → 856.80] where Brittany would be feeling
[856.80 → 857.94] like she might go into labour
[857.94 → 859.04] and I would seriously
[859.04 → 859.80] contemplate
[859.80 → 860.62] dressed,
[860.96 → 861.52] going to bed
[861.52 → 862.32] completely dressed,
[862.44 → 863.42] car keys in my hand
[863.42 → 864.68] so that if any contractions
[864.68 → 864.98] happen,
[865.30 → 865.54] boom,
[865.62 → 866.54] I'd get up in the car,
[866.62 → 867.12] we're gone.
[867.28 → 868.22] We're not doing a home birth.
[868.22 → 870.34] I understood that sense
[870.34 → 870.90] of being ready.
[871.72 → 872.64] And what Paul is saying,
[872.70 → 873.24] don't miss this,
[873.28 → 873.60] he's saying,
[874.18 → 874.76] that baby,
[875.30 → 876.26] that new creation
[876.26 → 877.28] is coming.
[878.00 → 878.98] That day of the Lord,
[879.28 → 880.52] it is inevitable
[880.52 → 882.72] and it is a surprise.
[883.58 → 884.44] So be ready.
[886.12 → 887.00] That's his point.
[887.40 → 888.76] But notice how Paul connects
[888.76 → 890.48] this image of the child coming
[890.48 → 891.54] is actually a sobering one.
[891.60 → 892.10] He says,
[892.44 → 893.38] and I want to read for you,
[893.38 → 896.60] he says,
[896.82 → 898.20] while the people are saying
[898.20 → 899.44] peace and safety,
[899.94 → 901.64] destruction will come on them
[901.64 → 903.44] suddenly as labour pains
[903.44 → 904.38] on a pregnant woman
[904.38 → 906.38] and they will not escape.
[907.70 → 908.78] Now, peace and safety,
[908.88 → 909.88] that phrase is an important one.
[909.92 → 910.80] It's sort of a slogan
[910.80 → 911.48] for the Caesar.
[911.58 → 912.52] When people in the first century
[912.52 → 913.46] would say peace and safety,
[913.74 → 914.80] they're referring to him.
[914.88 → 915.94] The same way that if you say
[915.94 → 917.42] make America great again,
[917.68 → 919.00] it refers to Trump's slogan.
[919.06 → 919.64] Or if you say,
[919.74 → 920.50] what does Trudeau say?
[920.84 → 921.74] Speaking moistly.
[921.80 → 922.42] You know we're talking
[922.42 → 923.08] about Trudeau.
[923.38 → 924.64] But peace and safety
[924.64 → 926.30] was about the Caesar.
[926.46 → 926.94] And you should know
[926.94 → 927.80] that Thessalonica
[927.80 → 929.00] is a city
[929.00 → 930.50] that loved
[930.50 → 932.18] what Caesar was up to,
[932.24 → 932.94] what the Roman emperor
[932.94 → 933.32] was doing
[933.32 → 934.14] because it brought them
[934.14 → 934.86] a lot of wealth,
[935.30 → 936.04] safe travel,
[936.22 → 936.84] safe trade,
[936.88 → 937.92] and they were a wealthy city
[937.92 → 938.90] and they actually had a temple
[938.90 → 940.10] in the middle of their city
[940.10 → 941.80] for worshipping him.
[942.60 → 943.42] And so it's very likely
[943.42 → 944.00] that there would be
[944.00 → 945.36] sort of written inscriptions
[945.36 → 946.66] on walls or billboards
[946.66 → 947.48] in their own city
[947.48 → 949.06] that said peace and safety
[949.06 → 950.48] brought to you by the Caesar.
[950.56 → 951.26] You're very welcome.
[951.26 → 953.12] But Paul,
[953.90 → 955.30] and anyone who knows
[955.30 → 957.84] how this empire was built
[957.84 → 959.70] sees right through
[959.70 → 960.60] that peace and safety.
[961.22 → 962.68] When Rome extended its borders,
[962.76 → 963.42] how did it do it?
[964.46 → 965.40] Military victory.
[965.68 → 967.12] They decimated their opponents.
[967.80 → 968.90] How else did they establish
[968.90 → 969.36] their borders?
[969.66 → 970.52] Heavy taxation
[970.52 → 971.44] for anyone who wasn't
[971.44 → 972.12] a Roman citizen.
[972.50 → 973.68] How else did they prop up
[973.68 → 974.20] their empire?
[974.54 → 976.80] They enslaved the conquered people
[976.80 → 977.70] and made them build
[977.70 → 978.86] the empire for them.
[979.34 → 980.70] What kind of peace and safety
[980.70 → 981.84] are you talking about, Caesar?
[982.50 → 983.58] And Paul says,
[983.66 → 984.42] and I want to say this
[984.42 → 985.46] as clearly as I can,
[986.08 → 986.82] unequivocally,
[987.46 → 988.42] kingdoms built
[988.42 → 990.24] on power
[990.24 → 991.40] and violence
[991.40 → 992.24] and personality
[992.24 → 992.98] like a Caesar,
[993.44 → 996.26] they will not escape
[996.26 → 997.42] the judgment
[997.42 → 998.38] of the living God.
[998.38 → 1000.42] And yes,
[1000.58 → 1001.18] Rome fell
[1001.18 → 1002.30] some few years later,
[1003.10 → 1004.50] but this is also true
[1004.50 → 1007.14] for every current government
[1007.14 → 1008.62] and structure
[1008.62 → 1009.78] that is built
[1009.78 → 1011.24] around something other
[1011.24 → 1012.14] than submission
[1012.14 → 1012.66] to the rule
[1012.66 → 1013.48] of Jesus Christ.
[1013.48 → 1016.48] It will not stand
[1017.22 → 1018.96] before his authority.
[1018.96 → 1023.04] Now that's a sobering point,
[1023.78 → 1025.72] but that is also good news
[1025.72 → 1026.94] because of some
[1026.94 → 1028.32] of the greatest oppression
[1028.32 → 1029.28] happens in our world
[1029.28 → 1030.00] right now
[1030.00 → 1031.84] through unjust structures
[1031.84 → 1033.52] and corrupt leaders
[1033.52 → 1035.18] building their own kingdoms
[1035.18 → 1037.08] ignorant of the true king,
[1037.62 → 1038.26] Jesus Christ.
[1039.98 → 1041.48] Now sobering as these points
[1041.48 → 1041.82] may be,
[1041.92 → 1042.82] this passage is actually
[1042.82 → 1043.96] one of deep encouragement
[1043.96 → 1045.06] and I want us to see
[1045.06 → 1046.28] how Paul shifts his attention
[1046.28 → 1047.70] in verse four.
[1048.38 → 1048.68] Paul says,
[1048.68 → 1050.06] but you brothers and sisters
[1050.06 → 1052.04] are not in darkness,
[1052.62 → 1052.92] but this,
[1053.04 → 1054.28] and so it should not surprise you
[1054.28 → 1055.08] that this day will come
[1055.08 → 1056.04] like a thief in the night.
[1056.70 → 1057.96] You are children of the light,
[1058.24 → 1059.92] you are children of the day.
[1060.86 → 1061.78] Now I want you to see
[1061.78 → 1062.50] what Paul's doing here
[1062.50 → 1063.12] because this is actually
[1063.12 → 1064.08] a pretty significant part
[1064.08 → 1064.50] of the passage.
[1064.62 → 1065.28] He's saying to the church,
[1065.74 → 1066.68] wrong question.
[1067.82 → 1069.26] Do not preoccupy yourselves
[1069.26 → 1070.38] on when the day
[1070.38 → 1071.16] of the Lord is coming.
[1071.78 → 1072.54] Preoccupy yourselves
[1072.54 → 1074.20] on how you are to live
[1074.20 → 1074.88] right now
[1074.88 → 1076.22] knowing that this day
[1076.22 → 1076.66] is coming.
[1076.66 → 1079.10] And Paul even adds to that,
[1079.48 → 1080.38] you also know
[1080.38 → 1082.48] that that new world to come
[1082.48 → 1083.80] has already broken
[1083.80 → 1084.64] into the present
[1084.64 → 1085.38] through the death
[1085.38 → 1086.32] and resurrection of Jesus
[1086.32 → 1087.28] and the outpouring
[1087.28 → 1087.80] of the Spirit.
[1088.12 → 1089.48] You already live
[1089.48 → 1091.16] in that age to come
[1091.16 → 1092.98] through what Jesus has done.
[1093.58 → 1094.42] So the question is,
[1094.68 → 1096.34] how are you to live
[1096.34 → 1097.32] as you wait?
[1098.26 → 1099.24] And I'm struck,
[1099.32 → 1100.42] and you need to see this,
[1100.62 → 1102.20] by the present tense statements
[1102.20 → 1103.58] that Paul makes.
[1103.58 → 1104.62] He says to them,
[1105.06 → 1107.30] you are children of the day.
[1107.70 → 1108.56] You, present tense,
[1108.68 → 1110.10] do not belong to the night.
[1110.32 → 1111.16] And he's doing something
[1111.16 → 1111.84] I want you to see
[1111.84 → 1112.28] that he does
[1112.28 → 1113.12] in many of his letters.
[1113.98 → 1114.98] He's emphasizing
[1114.98 → 1116.08] their identity.
[1117.22 → 1118.04] When believers
[1118.04 → 1118.96] in any generation,
[1119.10 → 1119.50] but believers
[1119.50 → 1120.44] in the early church,
[1121.32 → 1122.16] turned away
[1122.16 → 1123.16] from their old allegiances,
[1123.32 → 1123.92] their old identity
[1123.92 → 1124.50] into Jesus,
[1124.66 → 1125.38] a lot shifted.
[1125.84 → 1126.44] It no longer
[1126.44 → 1127.68] was their core identity
[1127.68 → 1128.42] that they were born
[1128.42 → 1129.36] as a Roman citizen.
[1129.84 → 1130.42] It no longer
[1130.42 → 1131.54] was their core identity
[1131.54 → 1132.14] that they were part
[1132.14 → 1132.72] of this temple
[1132.72 → 1133.72] or that temple practice
[1133.72 → 1134.38] that sort of shaped
[1134.38 → 1135.40] their family life
[1135.40 → 1136.26] and their cultic life.
[1136.60 → 1138.16] Now, all that mattered
[1138.16 → 1139.94] was that by faith in Jesus,
[1140.18 → 1141.24] they belonged
[1141.24 → 1142.96] as children of the Father.
[1143.80 → 1144.96] They were grafted
[1144.96 → 1146.08] into the body of Christ.
[1146.34 → 1147.44] They were covered over
[1147.44 → 1148.00] by the death
[1148.00 → 1148.92] and resurrection of Jesus.
[1149.18 → 1150.06] They were destined
[1150.06 → 1151.20] for resurrection
[1151.20 → 1152.58] in a new creation
[1152.58 → 1153.34] in the presence
[1153.34 → 1154.46] of Jesus himself.
[1154.84 → 1156.00] That's who they were.
[1156.42 → 1157.08] And what Paul's saying,
[1157.28 → 1158.28] that's who you are,
[1158.60 → 1160.06] now live like it.
[1160.06 → 1162.18] You're a child of the day.
[1162.72 → 1163.50] Live like it,
[1163.58 → 1164.74] sober and alert.
[1165.34 → 1166.06] You don't belong
[1166.06 → 1167.18] to the darkness anymore.
[1167.74 → 1169.20] Live who you already are
[1169.20 → 1171.56] through what Jesus already did.
[1172.80 → 1173.54] You see that movement?
[1174.50 → 1175.42] And to draw this out
[1175.42 → 1176.08] as encouragement,
[1176.66 → 1177.26] Paul talks about
[1177.26 → 1177.82] this contrast
[1177.82 → 1179.38] between night and day,
[1179.56 → 1180.60] darkness and light.
[1181.38 → 1182.12] And he's using them
[1182.12 → 1183.86] as sort of way
[1183.86 → 1184.38] of understanding
[1184.38 → 1185.08] a posture
[1185.08 → 1186.82] towards the coming
[1186.82 → 1187.68] day of the Lord.
[1187.68 → 1189.20] There are actions
[1189.20 → 1190.12] that happen at night
[1190.12 → 1191.68] that are unique
[1191.68 → 1192.12] to the night
[1192.12 → 1192.88] and actions that happen
[1192.88 → 1193.38] during the day
[1193.38 → 1193.84] that are unique
[1193.84 → 1194.38] to the day.
[1195.08 → 1195.92] When I was preparing
[1195.92 → 1196.44] the sermon,
[1196.70 → 1197.56] I was brought back
[1197.56 → 1198.46] to a memory of my own
[1198.46 → 1200.10] where I was in the Bronx
[1200.10 → 1201.10] on a surf trip
[1201.10 → 1201.92] in university.
[1202.64 → 1203.12] Has anyone here
[1203.12 → 1203.76] been to the Bronx?
[1204.64 → 1205.32] A couple of people?
[1205.88 → 1206.20] Candy?
[1207.70 → 1209.30] And when I was there,
[1209.42 → 1210.36] we had a great time.
[1210.46 → 1210.72] We were doing
[1210.72 → 1211.52] a housing project
[1211.52 → 1212.50] in the middle of the Bronx
[1212.50 → 1213.40] and we were able
[1213.40 → 1214.56] to go outside and play
[1214.56 → 1215.02] and get to know
[1215.02 → 1216.04] the neighbours of that city.
[1216.04 → 1217.08] And then at night,
[1217.20 → 1217.70] we were told,
[1218.32 → 1218.88] you are not allowed
[1218.88 → 1219.48] to go outside.
[1220.56 → 1221.38] The very places
[1221.38 → 1221.94] that you played
[1221.94 → 1222.80] with kids in the day
[1222.80 → 1224.02] is not safe at night.
[1224.10 → 1224.38] In fact,
[1224.40 → 1225.12] you'd be a fool
[1225.12 → 1226.12] to go to that park
[1226.12 → 1226.82] across the road
[1226.82 → 1227.48] from where you're staying
[1227.48 → 1227.82] at night
[1227.82 → 1228.68] because there are activities
[1228.68 → 1229.52] that happen at night
[1229.52 → 1230.64] that do not happen
[1230.64 → 1231.18] during the day.
[1231.54 → 1232.06] You get it.
[1232.74 → 1233.60] And Paul's saying,
[1233.68 → 1234.60] he's giving this posture
[1234.60 → 1235.02] of nighttime,
[1235.16 → 1235.48] he's saying,
[1235.78 → 1236.94] drunkenness and sleep
[1236.94 → 1237.68] happen at night.
[1238.72 → 1239.68] And when he's saying that,
[1239.72 → 1240.48] he's basically saying
[1240.48 → 1242.28] people are not aware
[1242.28 → 1243.46] of what's going on.
[1243.90 → 1245.38] They are unconcerned
[1245.38 → 1246.46] and they're apathetic
[1246.46 → 1247.62] to the bigger movement
[1247.62 → 1248.66] of God in history.
[1248.76 → 1249.44] They're asleep
[1249.44 → 1250.60] and they're drunk
[1250.60 → 1251.26] to the reality
[1251.26 → 1252.24] of the coming day
[1252.24 → 1252.70] of the Lord.
[1253.48 → 1254.50] By contrast,
[1255.22 → 1256.08] daytime people
[1256.08 → 1256.82] are awake.
[1257.66 → 1258.64] They are sober.
[1259.24 → 1260.16] They have their eyes
[1260.16 → 1261.58] opened to the reality
[1261.58 → 1262.28] of God's coming,
[1262.40 → 1263.04] to what he's doing
[1263.04 → 1263.52] in the present.
[1263.78 → 1264.34] They're in tune
[1264.34 → 1265.12] with God's movement
[1265.12 → 1266.04] and they're ready.
[1266.56 → 1267.34] They're ready
[1267.34 → 1268.08] for him coming.
[1268.08 → 1269.02] And so Paul says,
[1269.54 → 1271.24] be daytime people.
[1272.10 → 1272.94] And by the way,
[1273.42 → 1274.02] Jesus' death
[1274.02 → 1274.68] and resurrection
[1274.68 → 1276.26] makes you such.
[1278.96 → 1280.14] Building on this encouragement,
[1280.30 → 1281.06] Paul says to them,
[1281.40 → 1282.18] put on faith
[1282.18 → 1282.68] and love
[1282.68 → 1283.50] as a breastplate
[1283.50 → 1285.00] and put on hope
[1285.00 → 1286.00] as your helmet.
[1286.58 → 1287.90] He takes this military imagery
[1287.90 → 1288.74] and you see it again
[1288.74 → 1289.62] in Ephesians 6
[1289.62 → 1290.24] and he says,
[1290.32 → 1291.22] we want you to go to war
[1291.22 → 1292.46] but there are no weapons,
[1292.56 → 1293.16] there's no sword.
[1293.24 → 1294.26] Your weapons are hope,
[1294.92 → 1295.28] faith,
[1295.28 → 1296.28] and love.
[1296.64 → 1297.42] These are the means
[1297.42 → 1298.62] by which you fight
[1298.62 → 1300.44] to live as daytime people.
[1301.50 → 1302.50] The way you fight
[1302.50 → 1303.50] the draw
[1303.50 → 1304.18] to be someone
[1304.18 → 1305.34] who lives in the darkness,
[1306.16 → 1307.34] the way you stay awake
[1307.34 → 1308.18] and sober
[1308.18 → 1309.94] is by living in faith
[1309.94 → 1310.90] in Jesus Christ,
[1311.88 → 1312.96] living in love
[1312.96 → 1313.86] for your father
[1313.86 → 1314.82] and for your neighbours
[1314.82 → 1315.48] and your city
[1315.48 → 1316.96] and living in hope
[1316.96 → 1317.86] that the Jesus
[1317.86 → 1318.92] who died and rose
[1318.92 → 1320.30] is coming again
[1320.30 → 1321.26] in glory and power.
[1323.78 → 1324.82] Like a good pastor,
[1324.82 → 1325.46] Paul finishes
[1325.46 → 1326.26] with some good news
[1326.26 → 1327.00] and I want to read it
[1327.00 → 1327.78] for you.
[1329.28 → 1330.96] For God did not appoint us
[1330.96 → 1332.40] to suffer wrath
[1332.40 → 1334.68] but to receive salvation
[1334.68 → 1337.48] through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1338.20 → 1339.24] He died for us
[1339.24 → 1340.36] so that whether we are awake
[1340.36 → 1341.02] or asleep,
[1341.46 → 1342.78] we may live together
[1342.78 → 1343.32] with him.
[1343.70 → 1344.02] Therefore,
[1344.40 → 1345.52] encourage one another
[1345.52 → 1346.64] and build each other up
[1346.64 → 1347.70] just as you are
[1347.70 → 1349.18] in fact doing.
[1350.00 → 1350.80] Did you hear that?
[1350.80 → 1354.22] Not only are believers
[1354.22 → 1355.28] not to fear death
[1355.28 → 1355.96] because they are asleep
[1355.96 → 1356.48] in Christ,
[1357.18 → 1359.12] we are also not to fear
[1359.12 → 1360.30] that coming day
[1360.30 → 1360.82] of the Lord.
[1362.06 → 1363.18] Paul says unequivocally,
[1363.52 → 1364.54] if you are in Christ,
[1364.92 → 1366.52] you are not appointed
[1366.52 → 1367.54] for wrath.
[1368.28 → 1370.02] You have nothing to fear.
[1370.74 → 1371.64] Your life is covered
[1371.64 → 1372.32] with Christ.
[1372.60 → 1373.56] The blood of that lamb
[1373.56 → 1375.00] is covered over you.
[1375.12 → 1376.30] It's passed over you
[1376.30 → 1377.68] and you will live together
[1377.68 → 1378.34] in the presence
[1378.34 → 1379.82] of Jesus Christ forever.
[1381.30 → 1382.34] Not only that,
[1382.54 → 1383.66] but you can be hopeful
[1383.66 → 1384.52] of that day
[1384.52 → 1385.60] knowing that you get
[1385.60 → 1386.56] to live in a world
[1386.56 → 1387.74] that will be free
[1387.74 → 1388.32] of oppression,
[1389.44 → 1390.04] that will be free
[1390.04 → 1390.58] of cancer,
[1391.18 → 1391.90] that will be free
[1391.90 → 1392.56] of a coronavirus,
[1393.12 → 1393.84] that will be free
[1393.84 → 1395.36] of death and tears
[1395.36 → 1396.38] and pain.
[1397.08 → 1397.94] Who doesn't want
[1397.94 → 1399.50] to live in that world?
[1401.98 → 1403.02] Now, with the few moments
[1403.02 → 1403.72] I have left,
[1403.82 → 1404.74] I want us to spend
[1404.74 → 1405.58] reflecting
[1405.58 → 1407.48] on what we hear
[1407.48 → 1408.48] the Spirit saying
[1408.48 → 1409.26] to us today
[1409.26 → 1411.04] as we listen in
[1411.04 → 1412.52] to a passage like this
[1412.52 → 1413.88] to the small church
[1413.88 → 1415.56] in the city of Thessalonica.
[1416.40 → 1417.78] As I sit with it,
[1418.66 → 1419.48] a number of things
[1419.48 → 1420.40] rise to the surface.
[1420.56 → 1421.10] Number one,
[1421.98 → 1423.54] Jesus is coming.
[1424.82 → 1426.16] Do you believe this?
[1426.92 → 1427.70] And I say that
[1427.70 → 1429.26] because we're all living
[1429.26 → 1430.60] in this Western world
[1430.60 → 1432.26] that has no real sense
[1432.26 → 1433.86] of His reality,
[1434.16 → 1434.82] of His coming,
[1434.82 → 1435.80] of His power,
[1436.72 → 1438.32] and we live as though
[1438.32 → 1439.16] it's not going to happen
[1439.16 → 1439.96] or we buy into
[1439.96 → 1440.66] these narratives
[1440.66 → 1441.28] that our world
[1441.28 → 1441.94] is sort of spinning
[1441.94 → 1443.14] in this endless cycle
[1443.14 → 1444.22] of violence and pain
[1444.22 → 1445.02] or that it's just going
[1445.02 → 1445.96] to get destroyed
[1445.96 → 1447.14] by human activity.
[1447.24 → 1447.94] And I get it.
[1448.44 → 1449.66] There are discouraging things
[1449.66 → 1450.42] happening in our world
[1450.42 → 1450.94] right now.
[1451.20 → 1452.60] But take hope, church.
[1453.96 → 1454.84] Jesus is coming.
[1456.10 → 1457.20] Do you believe that?
[1457.20 → 1459.96] And secondly,
[1460.28 → 1461.72] if that's true,
[1462.66 → 1464.40] hear what Paul is saying
[1464.40 → 1465.88] to be ready.
[1466.70 → 1468.14] It's going to be a surprise.
[1468.82 → 1469.92] No, we do not know
[1469.92 → 1470.42] when it's coming.
[1470.50 → 1471.06] I'm not making
[1471.06 → 1472.06] any foolish predictions.
[1472.52 → 1473.44] But Paul is saying,
[1473.60 → 1474.90] just like Jesus was saying,
[1475.36 → 1477.22] live like you're ready.
[1478.86 → 1480.16] I want to read a quote for you
[1480.16 → 1481.54] that comes from Sylvia Kinsman.
[1482.38 → 1483.28] She wrote this a number
[1483.28 → 1483.76] of years ago
[1483.76 → 1484.96] during an Advent season.
[1485.88 → 1487.06] And it's on how Christians
[1487.06 → 1488.70] in some ways are lulled
[1488.70 → 1490.14] into the lie of our culture
[1490.14 → 1491.88] of not living in hope.
[1492.24 → 1492.72] She writes,
[1493.14 → 1493.94] for many Christians,
[1494.16 → 1495.92] the question of living in hope
[1495.92 → 1497.36] doesn't seem that urgent.
[1498.08 → 1498.68] Many of us have
[1498.68 → 1499.72] a pretty good life.
[1500.10 → 1500.88] Jobs that put food
[1500.88 → 1501.42] on the table,
[1501.62 → 1502.58] holidays by the lake
[1502.58 → 1503.26] or seashore,
[1503.58 → 1504.20] enough clothes
[1504.20 → 1505.04] to keep us warm
[1505.04 → 1505.52] in the winter,
[1505.92 → 1507.26] a house or an apartment
[1507.26 → 1508.20] with enough space
[1508.20 → 1509.60] for us and our toys,
[1509.98 → 1510.96] and safety.
[1511.54 → 1512.74] We don't worry too much
[1512.74 → 1513.46] about whether we
[1513.46 → 1514.30] or our families
[1514.30 → 1515.44] will be alive in the morning.
[1516.44 → 1517.40] In such a situation,
[1518.26 → 1519.26] the question of the coming
[1519.26 → 1519.70] of the kingdom
[1519.70 → 1521.04] just isn't that pressing.
[1521.94 → 1523.10] We have it pretty good right now.
[1523.26 → 1524.06] Sure, we want to be
[1524.06 → 1524.94] with Jesus someday,
[1525.60 → 1527.88] but not just yet.
[1528.40 → 1529.04] Ever felt that?
[1529.90 → 1531.12] We have a movie or two
[1531.12 → 1531.80] we want to see,
[1531.88 → 1532.78] a trip we want to take
[1532.78 → 1533.94] before Jesus returns.
[1534.24 → 1535.02] It's no wonder
[1535.02 → 1535.98] that our lives
[1535.98 → 1536.76] aren't that different
[1536.76 → 1537.26] from those
[1537.26 → 1538.24] of our secular neighbours.
[1538.62 → 1540.18] We go to church on Sunday,
[1540.18 → 1541.92] but the rest of the week
[1541.92 → 1544.46] we look just like everybody else.
[1545.82 → 1546.82] And we need to name
[1546.82 → 1549.06] that gravitational pull
[1549.06 → 1550.32] in our Western society
[1550.32 → 1552.66] to be lulled back to sleep
[1552.66 → 1554.60] and to live in darkness.
[1555.30 → 1556.40] That gravitational pull
[1556.40 → 1557.98] to live in the imminent frame,
[1558.08 → 1559.18] to live for the here and now.
[1559.30 → 1560.24] Don't worry about the past.
[1560.36 → 1561.14] Don't worry about the future.
[1561.52 → 1562.66] Don't ask the big questions
[1562.66 → 1563.58] about why you exist.
[1563.92 → 1565.32] Just seize the day.
[1565.32 → 1567.56] And that is a powerful,
[1567.86 → 1568.98] subversive narrative
[1568.98 → 1569.80] that comes at us
[1569.80 → 1571.68] all day long
[1571.68 → 1573.64] in our current lives.
[1574.82 → 1576.04] And Paul says,
[1576.86 → 1577.44] be awake.
[1578.56 → 1579.74] Be sober.
[1580.86 → 1581.70] Be ready.
[1582.64 → 1584.12] That kingdom is coming.
[1584.66 → 1585.74] Jesus who rose
[1585.74 → 1587.06] will return
[1587.06 → 1588.16] to judge the living
[1588.16 → 1588.90] and the dead.
[1589.24 → 1590.82] It is inevitable.
[1592.34 → 1592.96] Be awake.
[1592.96 → 1596.20] I want to finish
[1596.20 → 1597.50] with a question
[1597.50 → 1598.22] that some of you
[1598.22 → 1598.82] have asked me
[1598.82 → 1599.84] over the last few months.
[1600.46 → 1601.12] Somebody even said
[1601.12 → 1601.98] in a phone conversation
[1601.98 → 1602.76] a few weeks ago,
[1603.12 → 1604.80] Jesus has to be coming soon.
[1605.16 → 1605.44] I mean,
[1605.56 → 1606.48] this is a mess
[1606.48 → 1607.16] that we're in.
[1607.90 → 1608.50] The question
[1608.50 → 1609.40] that many have asked
[1609.40 → 1610.24] in different ways
[1610.24 → 1610.68] is,
[1611.48 → 1613.00] why hasn't he already come?
[1614.14 → 1615.00] Why hasn't Jesus
[1615.00 → 1615.72] just come
[1615.72 → 1616.58] and healed the world
[1616.58 → 1617.48] and dealt with oppression
[1617.48 → 1618.82] like we're still suffering?
[1618.92 → 1619.46] Our world
[1619.46 → 1620.66] is under the weight
[1620.66 → 1621.16] of pain.
[1621.16 → 1621.38] Like,
[1621.48 → 1623.18] why hasn't he already come?
[1623.60 → 1624.46] Have you ever asked that?
[1626.16 → 1627.22] Let me answer
[1627.22 → 1629.20] with how Peter
[1629.20 → 1630.92] answers the church.
[1632.38 → 1632.76] He writes,
[1632.90 → 1634.40] the Lord is not slow
[1634.40 → 1635.70] in keeping his promise.
[1636.44 → 1636.78] Instead,
[1637.38 → 1638.54] he is patient
[1638.54 → 1639.72] with you.
[1640.40 → 1641.62] Not wanting
[1641.62 → 1642.44] anyone
[1642.44 → 1643.90] to perish,
[1644.60 → 1645.68] but everyone
[1645.68 → 1647.06] to come to repentance.
[1648.66 → 1649.84] Do you hear that?
[1649.84 → 1651.92] To put it
[1651.92 → 1652.52] differently,
[1652.94 → 1654.86] Jesus has delayed judgment.
[1655.46 → 1656.38] He has delayed
[1656.38 → 1657.70] that final day
[1657.70 → 1658.36] of the Lord
[1658.36 → 1660.50] so that
[1660.50 → 1662.52] people could come
[1662.52 → 1663.16] to faith
[1663.16 → 1664.52] and experience
[1664.52 → 1665.16] his salvation.
[1666.16 → 1667.48] And praise the Lord
[1667.48 → 1668.56] that we have heard
[1668.56 → 1669.22] that news
[1669.22 → 1670.48] and we have received
[1670.48 → 1671.34] that message
[1671.34 → 1672.38] and we don't need
[1672.38 → 1673.06] to live in fear
[1673.06 → 1673.68] of that day.
[1674.78 → 1675.40] Praise the Lord
[1675.40 → 1675.86] for that.
[1676.48 → 1677.80] But that also means,
[1677.90 → 1678.82] and this is an important point,
[1678.82 → 1680.38] that we get caught up
[1680.38 → 1681.32] in that mission
[1681.32 → 1682.36] until that day.
[1682.64 → 1683.80] The mission of the church
[1683.80 → 1685.86] is the era we live in.
[1686.04 → 1686.90] The reason Jesus
[1686.90 → 1687.70] hasn't come back
[1687.70 → 1688.64] is because we have
[1688.64 → 1689.60] a job to do
[1689.60 → 1690.60] in living
[1690.60 → 1691.36] and speaking
[1691.36 → 1692.42] and witnessing
[1692.42 → 1693.18] to the reign
[1693.18 → 1694.02] of Jesus Christ
[1694.02 → 1695.08] and him being
[1695.08 → 1695.52] King,
[1695.98 → 1696.28] Lord,
[1696.44 → 1697.40] and Saviour.
[1699.08 → 1700.06] Your neighbours
[1700.06 → 1701.26] need to hear
[1701.26 → 1702.02] that good news.
[1703.48 → 1704.50] Your neighbours
[1704.50 → 1705.88] need to see
[1705.88 → 1706.58] what life
[1706.58 → 1708.38] in this new creation
[1708.38 → 1709.56] looks like
[1709.56 → 1710.44] through you.
[1711.54 → 1712.30] And I'm struck
[1712.30 → 1713.34] by how Paul says,
[1713.78 → 1714.34] your armour
[1714.34 → 1715.28] is faith,
[1715.86 → 1716.48] it's hope,
[1716.72 → 1717.78] and it's love.
[1719.22 → 1719.92] And my prayer
[1719.92 → 1720.32] this week
[1720.32 → 1721.14] is that your neighbours,
[1721.30 → 1721.80] your co-workers,
[1721.94 → 1722.52] your friends
[1722.52 → 1723.66] would see
[1723.66 → 1724.64] through your faith,
[1725.70 → 1726.48] your hope,
[1727.06 → 1729.08] and your love
[1729.08 → 1730.74] a taste
[1730.74 → 1732.10] of that life
[1732.10 → 1732.72] that is coming
[1732.72 → 1734.56] and have a desire
[1734.56 → 1734.94] to say,
[1735.26 → 1736.00] what power,
[1736.44 → 1737.28] what life,
[1737.68 → 1738.44] what person
[1738.44 → 1740.38] has made this possible
[1740.38 → 1741.56] in you?
[1742.14 → 1743.44] And in so doing,
[1744.06 → 1745.10] see the good news
[1745.10 → 1746.68] of Jesus Christ.
[1747.44 → 1748.16] Let's pray.
[1753.20 → 1753.68] Father,
[1753.76 → 1754.38] we thank you
[1754.38 → 1755.50] for these scriptures
[1755.50 → 1757.94] and we thank you
[1757.94 → 1758.40] for the way
[1758.40 → 1759.34] you give us hope
[1759.34 → 1760.14] for the future.
[1760.14 → 1762.16] we thank you
[1762.16 → 1762.70] that the day
[1762.70 → 1763.26] is coming
[1763.26 → 1764.88] when violence
[1764.88 → 1765.74] will be no more,
[1766.86 → 1767.86] when abuse
[1767.86 → 1769.22] will be forgotten
[1769.22 → 1770.66] and over,
[1771.46 → 1772.34] when warfare
[1772.34 → 1773.22] will cease.
[1774.36 → 1775.36] We thank you
[1775.36 → 1776.00] that Jesus
[1776.00 → 1776.78] will come
[1776.78 → 1778.26] and make
[1778.26 → 1779.02] this world
[1779.02 → 1779.62] right.
[1781.08 → 1781.96] And Lord,
[1782.08 → 1782.74] we join
[1782.74 → 1783.40] the church
[1783.40 → 1784.26] of the ages,
[1785.08 → 1785.88] the church
[1785.88 → 1786.82] that is persecuted
[1786.82 → 1788.02] around the world,
[1788.60 → 1789.36] and the church
[1789.36 → 1789.78] that even
[1789.78 → 1790.16] in the book
[1790.16 → 1790.74] of Revelation
[1790.74 → 1792.44] cries out to you,
[1793.04 → 1794.28] how long?
[1795.72 → 1796.70] And we cry
[1796.70 → 1797.30] with them,
[1797.94 → 1798.92] come soon,
[1799.04 → 1799.60] Lord Jesus,
[1800.36 → 1801.06] and heal
[1801.06 → 1801.88] your world.
[1802.60 → 1802.88] Amen.
[1802.88 → 1803.06] Amen.
