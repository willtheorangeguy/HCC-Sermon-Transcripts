[0.00 --> 21.88]  Today we light our third Advent candle remembering Zach
[21.88 --> 46.48]  Zechariah and from that moment is unable to speak he will be able to speak when the child
[46.48 --> 52.76]  is born and he names him John his silence is a constant testimony to God's sure promises
[52.76 --> 54.92]  even in the face of doubt.
[54.92 --> 64.76]  Here in the stained glass window we see Zechariah writing out his newborn son's name God's promise
[64.76 --> 70.32]  fulfilled and then he can speak again and he sings a song of praise this God who acts
[70.32 --> 79.60]  even when he sings of his son preparing the way of Jesus.
[79.60 --> 81.24]  What a blessing.
[81.24 --> 86.60]  We light our third Advent candle remembering God's sure promises and we too praise our God
[86.60 --> 91.60]  for the gift of salvation.
[91.60 --> 116.52]  Good morning.
[116.52 --> 122.30]  My name is Valerie and I will be leading the community prayer.
[122.30 --> 129.28]  Also just want to remind you that one of the acts of worship is giving of our finances and
[129.28 --> 135.28]  one of the ways you can do that is to the mission of our church and the various things that we
[135.28 --> 142.00]  support and it's just a way of honoring God and acknowledging that everything that we have
[142.00 --> 147.04]  is a gift from God and it's a way of just giving back.
[147.04 --> 153.24]  For part of the prayer I will be saying sort of general categories of things that people
[153.24 --> 160.92]  may struggle with and it's an opportunity in the silence for you to bring before God people
[160.92 --> 165.80]  and situations that you know of that relate.
[165.80 --> 171.84]  So would you please pray with me.
[171.84 --> 181.36]  Heavenly Father, we praise you this morning for sending Jesus to redeem your people.
[181.36 --> 189.38]  Though you are mighty, almighty, you sent your son to be lowly.
[189.38 --> 199.08]  Though you are holy and set apart, you sent your son to be God with us.
[199.08 --> 206.22]  Though you are perfect, you sent your son into an imperfect world to live as one of us and
[206.22 --> 210.38]  yet he was without sin.
[210.38 --> 216.14]  Jesus we thank you for coming near to humanity as a baby.
[216.14 --> 222.82]  We admit that we are often impressed by people with power, strength and fame.
[222.82 --> 228.04]  But to those people we come with varying degrees of fear.
[228.04 --> 232.02]  You came as a humble and weak baby.
[232.02 --> 238.52]  And when we are drawn to babies, we come with joy, love and tender care.
[238.52 --> 245.92]  Lord we thank you for the wisdom in sending Jesus as a baby to disarm our fears.
[245.92 --> 254.76]  To soften our hearts and to inspire us towards care and towards service.
[254.76 --> 262.94]  Jesus, you lived as one of us and you know the pain that comes with living in a world infected
[262.94 --> 263.94]  by sin.
[263.94 --> 269.00]  You know the effects of sin in each one of our lives.
[269.00 --> 274.46]  And we confess again that it is only through you and by your sacrifice on the cross that
[274.46 --> 279.18]  we can be cleaned of all that darkens us and our world.
[279.18 --> 287.94]  Lord Jesus, we pray for those this morning who are burdened in very specific ways.
[287.94 --> 295.00]  God, we pray for those who have been hurt relationally.
[295.00 --> 307.18]  And we pray for you to bring peace, forgiveness and reconciliation.
[307.18 --> 314.32]  Lord Jesus, for those who have hurt inside of their bodies, we pray that you bring healing
[314.32 --> 323.20]  and strength.
[323.20 --> 338.86]  Holy Jesus, for those experiencing hurt in areas of mental health, we pray that you bring wholeness.
[338.86 --> 346.50]  For those whose hearts ache with the hurt brought by death of family and friends.
[346.50 --> 357.80]  Lord God, we pray you bring comfort.
[357.80 --> 364.32]  God we also pray for those in our community whose bellies are not full and whose fridges
[364.32 --> 368.08]  and pantries are empty.
[368.08 --> 372.84]  God we thank you for all those who help at the Cloverdale Community Kitchen and other places
[372.84 --> 377.54]  that serve food for the needs of those with less.
[377.54 --> 390.90]  God we pray for generosity within our community that we look for those in need and help out.
[390.90 --> 398.04]  God we pray for those who are struggling with work, jobs, vocation.
[398.04 --> 411.94]  God we pray that you open opportunities and creativity so there is a path towards meaningful work.
[411.94 --> 416.70]  God we pray for those who are struggling with work.
[416.70 --> 421.70]  God we pray for those who are struggling with work.
[421.70 --> 428.04]  Lord God we pray for those of you and for peace in nature.
[428.04 --> 431.12]  God we pray for the pain you are pregnant and the pain they need to be treated well.
[433.26 --> 436.20]  God we pray for you and for those who serve each of you and for your family.
[436.20 --> 448.44]  And Lord God, we pray for justice for those who are suffering with unjust circumstances.
[448.44 --> 469.70]  Holy God, help each of us to be people who can see burdens, who can see the burdens of those around us,
[469.70 --> 479.90]  and equip us and embolden us to be agents of peace and healing, support, encouragement, and comfort.
[480.86 --> 489.20]  God, we thank you for community, and we ask that you move by your spirit in everyone in this room,
[489.90 --> 495.52]  and that the people, your church, would bring your hope to the hopeless.
[495.52 --> 503.70]  And God, we also pray for those places around the world where there is conflict.
[505.02 --> 513.78]  God, we pray that your light shine and that peace roll over hatred and violence.
[514.48 --> 519.40]  God, we crave the day that guns are laid down and never picked up again.
[519.82 --> 521.72]  Come, Lord Jesus, come.
[525.52 --> 531.50]  Praise be to the Lord God of Israel, because you have come to redeem your people.
[532.30 --> 536.94]  Help us to live each moment as your redeemed ones.
[538.14 --> 544.16]  And God, we pray over the children as they bring delightful songs for us.
[544.66 --> 548.00]  May we experience your joy through them.
[548.00 --> 551.96]  And we pray for Pastor Sid as he brings your messages.
[552.78 --> 556.86]  May our minds be opened as he speaks your word.
[557.08 --> 558.68]  In Jesus' name, amen.
[561.30 --> 565.38]  After the service, if there's anyone who wants prayer, I'll be hanging out here.
[565.44 --> 566.90]  I'd be delighted to pray with you.
[566.90 --> 566.98]  Amen.
[566.98 --> 567.02]  Amen.
[567.02 --> 567.08]  Amen.
[567.08 --> 567.12]  Amen.
[567.12 --> 567.14]  Amen.
[567.14 --> 567.18]  Amen.
[567.18 --> 567.22]  Amen.
[567.22 --> 569.14]  Amen.
[569.14 --> 569.18]  Amen.
[569.18 --> 571.18]  Amen.
[571.18 --> 571.22]  Amen.
[571.22 --> 573.18]  Amen.
[573.18 --> 575.18]  Amen.
[575.18 --> 575.22]  Amen.
[578.00 --> 580.36]  Amen.
[582.30 --> 582.82]  Amen.
[582.82 --> 583.38]  Amen.
[583.38 --> 583.86]  Amen.
[583.86 --> 584.22]  Amen.
[584.22 --> 584.44]  Amen.
[584.44 --> 585.02]  Good morning.
[585.02 --> 591.36]  It's so good to be with you all in this time, in this service, in this season.
[591.84 --> 597.76]  Before I get into the message, I want to point out a way for you to help out.
[598.70 --> 602.24]  Valerie already mentioned about the offerings and all the good things that come out of our offerings.
[602.24 --> 612.54]  in the season of advent our church historically has picked a particular cause for the and you
[612.54 --> 619.12]  can see up here that that idea but we pick a cause for advent and we collect as much money
[619.12 --> 624.26]  as we can in the past we built various wells in various countries that's always been a beautiful
[624.26 --> 631.52]  thing but this time we're collecting during this advent season and even beyond it but for
[631.52 --> 639.80]  we're gonna we are sponsoring another refugee family and we need a eighty thousand dollars for
[639.80 --> 645.64]  that so it's not a small amount of money we have quite a bit but not all of that and so you have
[645.64 --> 650.66]  an opportunity to contribute for someone coming to the country who have been dealing with hardship
[650.66 --> 658.28]  and war and and difficulties and you can help them start a new life and that's what the refugee fund
[658.28 --> 664.90]  is about you can give there's an app an app here and there's a debit machine in the back and cash and
[664.90 --> 671.64]  checks I mean all on the back after the service so I encourage you to consider that if you can't do it
[671.64 --> 675.20]  that's what the
[675.20 --> 682.28]  oh and Dave has remind me there's something called launch here that's a grade four through seven there
[682.28 --> 690.88]  we go thank you guys I don't look like an idiot anyways so yeah that's going to be upstairs there they
[690.88 --> 694.42]  seem to know the way if you're visiting you're that age feel free to follow them
[694.42 --> 704.18]  we are as we've said in a season of advent advent is a time of waiting but also a time of preparing
[704.18 --> 706.70]  preparing our hearts for Christmas and beyond
[706.70 --> 715.20]  Christmas is I don't mean to sound negative at all here but Christmas is a challenging time for pastors
[715.20 --> 721.88]  not not only because there's so many services that's all fine but sometimes what how do you
[721.88 --> 725.56]  get people excited again about the story of the incarnation
[725.56 --> 729.62]  how do you make it come to life again because that's what we want
[729.62 --> 731.76]  so we try all these different series
[731.76 --> 738.68]  and different ways of trying to approach the Christmas story so that Christmas becomes real to you
[738.68 --> 740.84]  the birth of Jesus becomes real to you
[740.84 --> 746.28]  so that's what we're trying to do here in this season of we're trying to help you prepare your heart
[746.28 --> 748.76]  for Christmas and beyond
[748.76 --> 756.80]  as you've seen we're doing the songs of Luke they're found in Luke Luke didn't write them
[756.80 --> 766.68]  these are songs of advent songs yeah we could say poems spoken word and they're sung by they're written by
[766.68 --> 770.40]  Zechariah said by Mary which Pastor Dave spoke on last week
[770.40 --> 776.74]  Zechariah which Pastor Dave nicely pointed out the fact that he's an old guy and so an old guy gets to preach on him
[776.74 --> 781.00]  but Pastor Dave gets to preach on another old guy next week on Simeon
[781.00 --> 784.56]  so there's a lot of old guys doing a lot of amazing things
[784.56 --> 786.58]  shout out for the old guys so there we go
[786.58 --> 792.06]  and then the last one that we'll talk about is the angel songs
[792.06 --> 794.56]  and they're all found in Luke 1 and 2
[794.56 --> 799.02]  today as I said I'm going to talk about Zechariah
[799.02 --> 800.30]  but I'm going to give you a little bit of background
[800.30 --> 802.70]  because the passage we jump into needs a little context
[802.70 --> 806.70]  as I said there's an older couple Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth
[806.70 --> 808.20]  Zechariah is a priest
[808.20 --> 810.92]  they are childless
[810.92 --> 814.02]  they'd prayed for many many many years
[814.02 --> 816.00]  and still have no child
[816.00 --> 819.72]  perhaps they'd given up praying by now
[819.72 --> 822.32]  they might feel really discouraged about it
[822.32 --> 825.20]  and one day Zechariah he was on duty
[825.20 --> 826.66]  as a priest
[826.66 --> 830.18]  and he had to go into a part of the temple called the holy place
[830.18 --> 832.24]  to offer a sacrifice
[832.24 --> 836.98]  suddenly an angel named Gabriel appears before him
[836.98 --> 840.26]  and Gabriel told him and gave him the news
[840.26 --> 844.36]  that said his old wife and him are soon to have a son
[844.36 --> 846.72]  and that son would be named John
[846.72 --> 850.10]  and he would be a prophet to prepare the way
[850.10 --> 852.56]  for the long awaited Messiah
[852.56 --> 856.40]  unbelievable good news
[856.40 --> 859.44]  and Zechariah's response
[859.44 --> 860.82]  doubt
[860.82 --> 864.78]  how do an old couple like me and my wife
[864.78 --> 866.24]  have a baby
[866.24 --> 868.62]  I don't think that's going to happen
[868.62 --> 871.72]  and the angel catches this doubt
[871.72 --> 874.76]  and he says Zechariah you're not going to be able to speak
[874.76 --> 876.78]  until the baby is born
[876.78 --> 879.54]  so he's going to be silent for the nine months
[879.54 --> 881.46]  of this pregnancy
[881.46 --> 883.86]  and then we come to the passage
[883.86 --> 884.94]  where we are today
[884.94 --> 885.86]  nine months go by
[885.86 --> 887.44]  look at it with me
[887.44 --> 889.78]  Luke 1 starting at verse 57
[889.78 --> 894.50]  now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth
[894.50 --> 897.16]  and she bore a son
[897.16 --> 900.72]  and her neighbors and relatives heard about what the Lord
[900.72 --> 903.18]  that the Lord had shown great mercy to her
[903.18 --> 905.80]  and they rejoiced with her
[905.80 --> 906.72]  you can only imagine
[906.72 --> 908.06]  they rejoiced with her
[908.06 --> 909.56]  and on the eighth day
[909.56 --> 911.34]  they came to circumcise the child
[911.34 --> 913.92]  and they would have called him Zechariah
[913.92 --> 914.98]  after his father
[914.98 --> 917.24]  but his mother answered
[917.24 --> 917.94]  no no no
[917.94 --> 920.10]  he shall be called John
[920.10 --> 922.60]  and they said to her
[922.60 --> 925.80]  what none of your relatives is called by that name
[925.80 --> 928.74]  and they made signs to his father
[928.74 --> 931.70]  inquiring what he wanted him to be called
[931.70 --> 933.48]  and he asked for a writing tablet
[933.48 --> 935.38]  and wrote his name is John
[935.38 --> 937.46]  you saw that on the picture of the reading
[937.46 --> 938.70]  on that stained glass window
[938.70 --> 940.48]  he's writing his name is John
[940.48 --> 942.28]  and they all wondered
[942.28 --> 943.42]  or they were all amazed
[943.42 --> 945.50]  and immediately his mouth was open
[945.50 --> 946.60]  and his tongue loosed
[946.60 --> 947.30]  and he spoke
[947.30 --> 948.90]  blessing God
[948.90 --> 952.22]  and fear came on all the neighbors
[952.22 --> 954.78]  and all these things were talked about
[954.78 --> 956.70]  throughout all the hill country of Judea
[956.70 --> 957.94]  and all who heard them
[957.94 --> 959.02]  laid them up in their hearts
[959.02 --> 959.20]  saying
[959.20 --> 962.54]  what then will this child be
[962.54 --> 964.34]  for the hand of the Lord
[964.34 --> 965.72]  was with him
[965.72 --> 969.62]  and his father Zechariah
[969.62 --> 971.72]  so now he suddenly after nine months can speak
[971.72 --> 973.72]  was filled with the Holy Spirit
[973.72 --> 975.12]  and he prophesied
[975.12 --> 975.54]  saying
[975.54 --> 976.64]  and here we read this
[976.64 --> 977.72]  this is the song
[977.72 --> 980.82]  blessed be the Lord God of Israel
[980.82 --> 982.30]  for he has visited
[982.30 --> 983.84]  and redeemed his people
[983.84 --> 985.84]  and he has raised up
[985.84 --> 987.36]  a horn of salvation for us
[987.36 --> 989.32]  in the house of his servant David
[989.32 --> 991.86]  and he spoke by the mouth
[991.86 --> 993.62]  of his holy prophets from of old
[993.62 --> 995.32]  that we should be saved
[995.32 --> 996.06]  from our enemies
[996.06 --> 997.80]  and from the hands of all who hate us
[997.80 --> 999.84]  to show the mercy promised
[999.84 --> 1000.54]  to our fathers
[1000.54 --> 1003.20]  and to remember his holy covenant
[1003.20 --> 1005.76]  the oath that he swore
[1005.76 --> 1007.02]  to our father Abraham
[1007.02 --> 1009.10]  to grant us that we
[1009.10 --> 1010.76]  being delivered from the hands
[1010.76 --> 1011.18]  of our enemies
[1011.18 --> 1012.56]  might serve him
[1012.56 --> 1013.82]  without fear
[1013.82 --> 1015.74]  in holiness
[1015.74 --> 1016.74]  and righteousness
[1016.74 --> 1017.96]  before him
[1017.96 --> 1019.26]  all our days
[1019.26 --> 1021.36]  and you
[1021.36 --> 1021.98]  child
[1021.98 --> 1022.96]  so now he starts speaking
[1022.96 --> 1023.56]  to his baby
[1023.56 --> 1024.88]  will be called
[1024.88 --> 1026.64]  the prophet of the most high
[1026.64 --> 1027.88]  for you will go before
[1027.88 --> 1028.36]  the Lord
[1028.36 --> 1029.42]  to prepare his way
[1029.42 --> 1030.14]  to give
[1030.14 --> 1032.04]  knowledge of salvation
[1032.04 --> 1032.88]  to his people
[1032.88 --> 1033.56]  and the forgiveness
[1033.56 --> 1034.38]  of their sins
[1034.38 --> 1036.00]  because of the tender mercy
[1036.00 --> 1036.84]  of our God
[1036.84 --> 1037.66]  whereby
[1037.66 --> 1039.08]  the sunrise
[1039.08 --> 1040.30]  shall visit us
[1040.30 --> 1041.34]  from on high
[1041.34 --> 1042.50]  to give light
[1042.50 --> 1043.50]  to those who sit
[1043.50 --> 1044.12]  in darkness
[1044.12 --> 1045.14]  and in the shadow
[1045.14 --> 1045.68]  of death
[1045.68 --> 1046.80]  to guide our feet
[1046.80 --> 1048.00]  in the way of peace
[1048.00 --> 1050.10]  and the child grew
[1050.10 --> 1051.00]  and became strong
[1051.00 --> 1051.58]  in spirit
[1051.58 --> 1053.38]  and he was in the wilderness
[1053.38 --> 1054.82]  until the day
[1054.82 --> 1056.46]  of his public appearance
[1056.46 --> 1057.36]  to Israel
[1057.36 --> 1059.74]  the word of the Lord
[1059.74 --> 1063.54]  I'd like to start off
[1063.54 --> 1064.62]  before I get into
[1064.62 --> 1065.70]  the song itself
[1065.70 --> 1066.94]  looking at some
[1066.94 --> 1067.76]  of the reactions
[1067.76 --> 1068.84]  of people
[1068.84 --> 1069.68]  in this story
[1069.68 --> 1071.92]  there's the first reaction
[1071.92 --> 1073.24]  that caught my eye
[1073.24 --> 1074.92]  was one of community joy
[1074.92 --> 1077.00]  they are rejoicing together
[1077.00 --> 1078.08]  old Elizabeth
[1078.08 --> 1078.92]  has a baby
[1078.92 --> 1080.40]  they're all excited for
[1080.40 --> 1081.54]  and in fact
[1081.54 --> 1082.50]  they acknowledge
[1082.50 --> 1083.26]  that it is
[1083.26 --> 1084.12]  God's mercy
[1084.12 --> 1084.90]  at work
[1084.90 --> 1086.44]  for Elizabeth
[1086.44 --> 1087.04]  you know
[1087.04 --> 1087.78]  it wasn't just waiting
[1087.78 --> 1088.42]  for nine months
[1088.42 --> 1089.46]  it seemed a lifetime
[1089.46 --> 1090.60]  of waiting for her
[1090.60 --> 1092.68]  we are reminded
[1092.68 --> 1093.92]  and I'm sure
[1093.92 --> 1095.40]  this wasn't lost
[1095.40 --> 1096.00]  on them either
[1096.00 --> 1096.84]  we are reminded
[1096.84 --> 1098.06]  of Sarah and Abraham
[1098.06 --> 1099.16]  in the Old Testament
[1099.16 --> 1101.36]  and they were promised
[1101.36 --> 1101.90]  a son
[1101.90 --> 1102.92]  that was going to become
[1102.92 --> 1104.14]  the nation of Israel
[1104.14 --> 1105.62]  and they are old people
[1105.62 --> 1106.20]  and they haven't even
[1106.20 --> 1106.88]  got a kid yet
[1106.88 --> 1107.86]  let alone a nation
[1107.86 --> 1109.62]  and they're waiting
[1109.62 --> 1110.48]  for their son
[1110.48 --> 1111.08]  and that son
[1111.08 --> 1112.12]  eventually comes
[1112.12 --> 1113.24]  his name is Isaac
[1113.24 --> 1116.06]  the words
[1116.06 --> 1117.22]  the angel speaks
[1117.22 --> 1118.84]  are coming true
[1118.84 --> 1120.84]  as if we shouldn't
[1120.84 --> 1121.26]  and we shouldn't
[1121.26 --> 1121.80]  be surprised
[1121.80 --> 1122.26]  should we
[1122.26 --> 1123.70]  it's interesting to me
[1123.70 --> 1124.88]  that Zachariah
[1124.88 --> 1126.32]  knew all the stories
[1126.32 --> 1126.80]  in scripture
[1126.80 --> 1127.44]  he's a priest
[1127.44 --> 1128.44]  he knows this stuff
[1128.44 --> 1129.52]  he would know
[1129.52 --> 1130.64]  the story of Abraham
[1130.64 --> 1131.34]  and Sarah
[1131.34 --> 1132.40]  and how God
[1132.40 --> 1133.74]  worked in amazing ways
[1133.74 --> 1135.28]  yet when it came
[1135.28 --> 1135.80]  to him
[1135.80 --> 1136.46]  and Elizabeth
[1136.46 --> 1139.12]  he doubts
[1139.12 --> 1141.56]  he doubts it
[1141.56 --> 1142.90]  you know
[1142.90 --> 1143.54]  I was thinking
[1143.54 --> 1144.72]  of contrasting
[1144.72 --> 1145.76]  his reaction
[1145.76 --> 1147.26]  here's this old priest
[1147.26 --> 1147.92]  right
[1147.92 --> 1148.54]  and then
[1148.54 --> 1150.40]  his doubtful reaction
[1150.40 --> 1151.12]  and then I think
[1151.12 --> 1151.94]  of Mary
[1151.94 --> 1152.50]  you know
[1152.50 --> 1153.22]  the angel comes
[1153.22 --> 1153.48]  you know
[1153.48 --> 1153.92]  Mary you're going
[1153.92 --> 1154.32]  to have a baby
[1154.32 --> 1154.72]  how am I going
[1154.72 --> 1155.14]  to have a baby
[1155.14 --> 1156.00]  I've never been
[1156.00 --> 1156.48]  with a man
[1156.48 --> 1157.46]  the Holy Spirit
[1157.46 --> 1158.32]  and you know
[1158.32 --> 1159.12]  like whoa
[1159.12 --> 1159.40]  you know
[1159.40 --> 1160.38]  it just blows her mind
[1160.38 --> 1160.78]  I'm sure
[1160.78 --> 1161.72]  and then
[1161.72 --> 1162.26]  you know
[1162.26 --> 1163.84]  she says
[1163.84 --> 1164.80]  she's greatly troubled
[1164.80 --> 1165.82]  but when all is said
[1165.82 --> 1166.10]  and done
[1166.10 --> 1166.66]  she says
[1166.66 --> 1167.92]  may it be
[1167.92 --> 1169.16]  as you have said
[1169.16 --> 1170.30]  I'm your servant
[1170.30 --> 1171.38]  I'll do what you
[1171.38 --> 1172.56]  need me to do
[1172.56 --> 1175.62]  I want to encourage
[1175.62 --> 1176.26]  you young people
[1176.26 --> 1176.74]  sometimes
[1176.74 --> 1177.40]  you know
[1177.40 --> 1178.12]  we always think
[1178.12 --> 1178.94]  it's the older people
[1178.94 --> 1179.58]  leading the way here
[1179.58 --> 1180.84]  Mary's a teenage girl
[1180.84 --> 1181.82]  who's about to get
[1181.82 --> 1183.74]  pregnant in a miraculous way
[1183.74 --> 1185.02]  and here's old Zechariah
[1185.02 --> 1185.78]  a long time priest
[1185.78 --> 1186.62]  and he doubts
[1186.62 --> 1189.16]  they all come out in the end
[1189.16 --> 1190.16]  but I just
[1190.16 --> 1190.58]  you know
[1190.58 --> 1191.62]  scripture says
[1191.62 --> 1192.66]  don't let anyone
[1192.66 --> 1193.30]  look down on you
[1193.30 --> 1194.10]  because you're young
[1194.10 --> 1194.28]  right
[1194.28 --> 1195.86]  you can have a deep faith
[1195.86 --> 1196.26]  too
[1196.26 --> 1197.56]  you can show them away
[1197.56 --> 1197.92]  so anyway
[1197.92 --> 1198.76]  a little aside there
[1198.76 --> 1200.44]  but I just love
[1200.44 --> 1201.72]  contrasting the reaction
[1201.72 --> 1203.06]  and you can see God
[1203.06 --> 1203.70]  you know
[1203.70 --> 1204.30]  Zechariah
[1204.30 --> 1204.56]  you know
[1204.56 --> 1205.28]  he read all these
[1205.28 --> 1205.94]  biblical stories
[1205.94 --> 1206.64]  of Abraham and Sarah
[1206.64 --> 1207.10]  and so forth
[1207.10 --> 1208.18]  you can see God
[1208.18 --> 1209.14]  at work in the Bible
[1209.14 --> 1210.50]  and yet you can fail
[1210.50 --> 1211.22]  to believe
[1211.22 --> 1212.98]  that that happens
[1212.98 --> 1213.94]  in your life
[1213.94 --> 1214.88]  in some ways
[1214.88 --> 1215.34]  as God
[1215.34 --> 1216.68]  as God defines
[1216.68 --> 1220.98]  Zechariah doubts
[1220.98 --> 1223.50]  and then the baby comes
[1223.50 --> 1225.56]  right
[1225.56 --> 1229.24]  the community comes out
[1229.24 --> 1230.50]  they're all rejoicing
[1230.50 --> 1231.44]  it's good news
[1231.44 --> 1233.12]  the baby is born
[1233.12 --> 1233.90]  to old Elizabeth
[1233.90 --> 1235.34]  and they all say
[1235.34 --> 1236.68]  isn't God merciful
[1236.68 --> 1239.28]  but then there's another reaction
[1239.28 --> 1240.26]  we go from joy
[1240.26 --> 1241.56]  to amazement
[1241.56 --> 1242.94]  we almost could say
[1242.94 --> 1243.58]  confusion
[1243.58 --> 1244.78]  at the choice
[1244.78 --> 1246.10]  of the name
[1246.10 --> 1246.84]  John
[1246.84 --> 1248.28]  joy
[1248.28 --> 1249.30]  now
[1249.30 --> 1250.08]  amazement
[1250.08 --> 1250.52]  what
[1250.52 --> 1251.40]  you know
[1251.40 --> 1252.58]  the boy's name
[1252.58 --> 1252.90]  is going
[1252.90 --> 1253.82]  they were going to name him
[1253.82 --> 1254.52]  Zechariah
[1254.52 --> 1255.38]  which would be according
[1255.38 --> 1256.58]  to tradition here
[1256.58 --> 1257.94]  you know
[1257.94 --> 1259.10]  but now we have
[1259.10 --> 1260.00]  the day of circumcision
[1260.00 --> 1261.38]  and this day of naming
[1261.38 --> 1264.52]  we pick names
[1264.52 --> 1265.20]  often by
[1265.20 --> 1266.70]  different criteria
[1266.70 --> 1268.40]  maybe how the name
[1268.40 --> 1269.16]  sounds
[1269.16 --> 1270.46]  maybe what someone
[1270.46 --> 1271.52]  reminds us of
[1271.52 --> 1272.88]  I was a teacher
[1272.88 --> 1273.74]  for many years
[1273.74 --> 1275.44]  I remember liking
[1275.44 --> 1276.32]  certain names
[1276.32 --> 1277.46]  you know
[1277.46 --> 1279.86]  prior to teaching
[1279.86 --> 1281.02]  but as I became a teacher
[1281.02 --> 1281.94]  and then we had kids
[1281.94 --> 1282.94]  and certain names
[1282.94 --> 1283.70]  that I might have given
[1283.70 --> 1284.22]  my kid
[1284.22 --> 1285.24]  I didn't want to give
[1285.24 --> 1285.52]  anymore
[1285.52 --> 1286.84]  because some student
[1286.84 --> 1287.54]  with that name
[1287.54 --> 1288.60]  would be what I remembered
[1288.60 --> 1288.96]  so
[1288.96 --> 1291.44]  I'm not going to name
[1291.44 --> 1292.46]  that one at all
[1292.46 --> 1295.02]  picking names
[1295.02 --> 1295.96]  is kind of
[1295.96 --> 1297.10]  a curious
[1297.10 --> 1298.14]  process
[1298.14 --> 1299.70]  in the Middle East
[1299.70 --> 1300.92]  they pick names
[1300.92 --> 1302.04]  on somewhat
[1302.04 --> 1302.92]  of a different criteria
[1302.92 --> 1303.72]  the sound
[1303.72 --> 1304.28]  didn't matter
[1304.28 --> 1304.82]  so much
[1304.82 --> 1306.56]  but let me give you
[1306.56 --> 1306.88]  an example
[1306.88 --> 1307.82]  back to Sarah
[1307.82 --> 1308.24]  and Abraham
[1308.24 --> 1309.34]  right
[1309.34 --> 1311.02]  an angel
[1311.02 --> 1311.76]  came to Abraham
[1311.76 --> 1312.08]  too
[1312.08 --> 1313.16]  and said
[1313.16 --> 1313.80]  hey you guys
[1313.80 --> 1314.24]  you're going to have
[1314.24 --> 1314.92]  a son
[1314.92 --> 1315.94]  Sarah's off
[1315.94 --> 1316.44]  in the background
[1316.44 --> 1317.38]  but she hears this
[1317.38 --> 1318.26]  and she goes
[1318.26 --> 1320.08]  yeah right
[1320.08 --> 1322.24]  she has this laugh
[1322.24 --> 1323.12]  you know
[1323.12 --> 1324.98]  I can't believe that
[1324.98 --> 1326.36]  us kids
[1326.36 --> 1327.88]  anyways
[1327.88 --> 1329.00]  later on
[1329.00 --> 1330.12]  she does have Isaac
[1330.12 --> 1331.38]  and then she also
[1331.38 --> 1332.32]  laughs in joy
[1332.32 --> 1334.04]  but the name
[1334.04 --> 1334.74]  of the child
[1334.74 --> 1335.32]  that they have
[1335.32 --> 1336.02]  is Isaac
[1336.02 --> 1338.08]  Isaac means laughter
[1338.08 --> 1339.70]  and you can imagine
[1339.70 --> 1340.34]  how Sarah
[1340.34 --> 1341.86]  calling Isaac laughter
[1341.86 --> 1343.08]  thinks of her doubt
[1343.08 --> 1344.08]  but also her
[1344.08 --> 1344.88]  her joy
[1344.88 --> 1346.42]  so these names
[1346.42 --> 1347.28]  are different here
[1347.28 --> 1347.78]  or
[1347.78 --> 1349.98]  maybe you know
[1349.98 --> 1350.48]  a picture
[1350.48 --> 1351.92]  it might paint a picture
[1351.92 --> 1352.78]  the name might paint a picture
[1352.78 --> 1354.12]  of who they might become
[1354.12 --> 1356.12]  John is named John
[1356.12 --> 1357.54]  which means God is gracious
[1357.54 --> 1358.76]  and if he's the forerunner
[1358.76 --> 1360.02]  of Jesus
[1360.02 --> 1361.18]  then we see
[1361.18 --> 1363.02]  God brings grace
[1363.02 --> 1363.40]  right
[1363.40 --> 1365.52]  most firstborn sons
[1365.52 --> 1366.46]  we have this a bit too
[1366.46 --> 1367.90]  would be named after their father
[1367.90 --> 1368.54]  and that's what everyone
[1368.54 --> 1369.22]  thought would happen
[1369.22 --> 1370.10]  this is going to be
[1370.10 --> 1370.42]  Zach
[1370.42 --> 1371.32]  Zachariah Jr.
[1371.32 --> 1372.82]  but Elizabeth said
[1372.82 --> 1373.48]  no no no no
[1373.48 --> 1374.12]  no no no
[1374.12 --> 1375.04]  he's not going to be that
[1375.04 --> 1375.86]  his name's going to be John
[1375.86 --> 1376.38]  and they all go
[1376.38 --> 1376.90]  what
[1376.90 --> 1378.80]  no one in the family
[1378.80 --> 1379.70]  is named John
[1379.70 --> 1381.78]  and they're amazed
[1381.78 --> 1383.18]  they're confused
[1383.18 --> 1384.42]  what's going on here
[1384.42 --> 1386.96]  so they go to Zachariah
[1386.96 --> 1389.64]  well we'll have Zachariah then
[1389.64 --> 1390.36]  because you don't know
[1390.36 --> 1390.96]  what's going on
[1390.96 --> 1392.98]  and they gave him a tablet
[1392.98 --> 1394.18]  maybe an iPad
[1394.18 --> 1395.08]  maybe a Samsung
[1395.08 --> 1396.12]  I'm not sure which one
[1396.12 --> 1398.30]  actually it was a piece of wood
[1398.30 --> 1399.12]  covered in wax
[1399.12 --> 1399.64]  but anyways
[1399.64 --> 1402.06]  and he writes
[1402.06 --> 1403.60]  and you saw that on that slide
[1403.60 --> 1405.30]  on that stained glass window
[1405.30 --> 1405.94]  he writes
[1405.94 --> 1408.44]  his name is John
[1408.44 --> 1412.38]  amazement
[1412.38 --> 1413.24]  joy
[1413.24 --> 1414.74]  amazement
[1414.74 --> 1415.42]  confusion
[1415.42 --> 1417.34]  and then we have another reaction
[1417.34 --> 1418.46]  an interesting one now
[1418.46 --> 1419.16]  now suddenly
[1419.16 --> 1420.70]  Zachariah can speak
[1420.70 --> 1422.88]  and he prophesies
[1422.88 --> 1423.78]  he sings a song
[1423.78 --> 1426.14]  and we go from that emotion
[1426.14 --> 1427.54]  of not joy
[1427.54 --> 1429.08]  not amazement
[1429.08 --> 1431.06]  but as scripture says here
[1431.06 --> 1432.16]  fear
[1432.16 --> 1434.56]  fear
[1434.56 --> 1437.34]  we could say awe
[1437.34 --> 1439.68]  news spreads
[1439.68 --> 1440.18]  it says here
[1440.18 --> 1441.10]  news spreads
[1441.10 --> 1441.98]  through the region
[1441.98 --> 1443.72]  we get some holy gossip
[1443.72 --> 1444.26]  going on here
[1444.26 --> 1445.48]  everybody's talking about it
[1445.48 --> 1445.66]  here
[1445.66 --> 1448.10]  they all wonder
[1448.10 --> 1448.74]  what's going to happen
[1448.74 --> 1449.24]  with this child
[1449.24 --> 1450.18]  because something amazing
[1450.18 --> 1450.82]  is going on here
[1450.82 --> 1452.58]  so when God acts
[1452.58 --> 1453.84]  why fear
[1453.84 --> 1455.12]  well when God acts
[1455.12 --> 1456.42]  be it sending an angel
[1456.42 --> 1457.34]  or babies
[1457.34 --> 1458.52]  or whatever
[1458.52 --> 1459.68]  the response is
[1459.68 --> 1460.50]  often fear
[1460.50 --> 1461.24]  and why is that
[1461.24 --> 1462.66]  because fear
[1462.66 --> 1464.52]  in the face
[1464.52 --> 1465.62]  of this God
[1465.62 --> 1467.02]  who knows what he's doing
[1467.02 --> 1468.08]  and we don't
[1468.08 --> 1469.84]  fear
[1469.84 --> 1471.66]  of this God
[1471.66 --> 1472.66]  who is in charge
[1472.66 --> 1473.68]  and we aren't
[1473.68 --> 1476.50]  we are reminded
[1476.50 --> 1477.98]  of our powerlessness
[1477.98 --> 1479.18]  we are reminded
[1479.18 --> 1480.64]  of our finiteness
[1480.64 --> 1481.68]  we are reminded
[1481.68 --> 1482.64]  of our sinfulness
[1482.64 --> 1483.22]  in the face
[1483.22 --> 1483.88]  of holiness
[1483.88 --> 1486.24]  this fear
[1486.24 --> 1487.36]  that drives us
[1487.36 --> 1488.56]  to reverence
[1488.56 --> 1489.24]  fear and reverence
[1489.24 --> 1489.98]  come close together
[1489.98 --> 1490.42]  sometimes
[1490.42 --> 1491.30]  to awe
[1491.30 --> 1492.74]  and then toward worship
[1492.74 --> 1493.40]  and we see that
[1493.40 --> 1494.08]  happening here
[1494.08 --> 1495.62]  notice how Zechariah's
[1495.62 --> 1496.42]  first words
[1496.42 --> 1497.44]  after nine months
[1497.44 --> 1498.46]  are words
[1498.46 --> 1499.34]  of praise
[1499.34 --> 1501.14]  right
[1501.14 --> 1502.28]  he starts off
[1502.28 --> 1503.72]  blessed be the God
[1503.72 --> 1504.18]  of Israel
[1504.18 --> 1506.28]  he has visited us
[1506.28 --> 1508.30]  and redeemed us
[1508.30 --> 1513.90]  I was thinking
[1513.90 --> 1514.66]  of that time
[1514.66 --> 1515.34]  of stillness
[1515.34 --> 1516.90]  and I love the verse
[1516.90 --> 1517.68]  many of you might know
[1517.68 --> 1518.86]  it's out of Psalm 46
[1518.86 --> 1519.92]  where it says
[1519.92 --> 1521.00]  be still
[1521.00 --> 1521.96]  and then what happens
[1521.96 --> 1523.56]  and know that I am God
[1523.56 --> 1525.04]  be still
[1525.04 --> 1526.66]  be quiet
[1526.66 --> 1529.22]  and then know
[1529.22 --> 1530.58]  that I am God
[1530.58 --> 1534.06]  I have been reflecting
[1534.06 --> 1534.84]  on that a little bit
[1534.84 --> 1536.40]  and what that silence
[1536.40 --> 1537.14]  did to him
[1537.14 --> 1539.74]  and imagining
[1539.74 --> 1541.08]  what it would be like
[1541.08 --> 1542.44]  you know
[1542.44 --> 1543.10]  as a pastor
[1543.10 --> 1544.28]  to say
[1544.28 --> 1544.82]  okay you are not
[1544.82 --> 1545.26]  going to be able
[1545.26 --> 1545.66]  to speak
[1545.66 --> 1546.48]  for nine months
[1546.48 --> 1547.98]  I don't know
[1547.98 --> 1548.98]  if I could survive that
[1548.98 --> 1552.32]  and he doesn't come out
[1552.32 --> 1553.12]  frustrated
[1553.12 --> 1553.94]  and angry
[1553.94 --> 1555.56]  he comes out
[1555.56 --> 1556.08]  singing
[1556.08 --> 1556.92]  through the power
[1556.92 --> 1557.70]  of the Holy Spirit
[1557.70 --> 1559.02]  and his song is called
[1559.02 --> 1560.06]  the Benedictus
[1560.06 --> 1561.38]  it's Latin for blessed
[1561.38 --> 1563.16]  he sees in that time
[1563.16 --> 1563.70]  of silence
[1563.70 --> 1565.12]  how deeply God
[1565.12 --> 1565.62]  is at work
[1565.62 --> 1566.62]  and how blessed
[1566.62 --> 1567.36]  he is not only
[1567.36 --> 1567.98]  to get a son
[1567.98 --> 1569.30]  but this son
[1569.30 --> 1571.36]  and he sees
[1571.36 --> 1571.98]  that the world
[1571.98 --> 1572.62]  is blessed
[1572.62 --> 1574.46]  through all of this
[1574.46 --> 1578.68]  he goes from doubt
[1578.68 --> 1579.90]  to praise
[1579.90 --> 1584.18]  when he has time
[1584.18 --> 1584.74]  to reflect
[1584.74 --> 1585.38]  and be quiet
[1585.38 --> 1587.12]  to be silent
[1587.12 --> 1587.98]  and let the spirit
[1587.98 --> 1588.92]  speak to him
[1588.92 --> 1589.88]  and I think
[1589.88 --> 1590.76]  those two go together
[1590.76 --> 1591.36]  I sometimes think
[1591.36 --> 1592.22]  we are just too talkative
[1592.22 --> 1593.58]  too hectic
[1593.58 --> 1594.16]  too busy
[1594.16 --> 1595.34]  especially in this time
[1595.34 --> 1595.64]  of year
[1595.64 --> 1597.18]  a time to reflect
[1597.18 --> 1598.74]  a time to repent
[1598.74 --> 1599.94]  of the doubt
[1599.94 --> 1601.32]  a time to deeply
[1601.32 --> 1602.36]  think and pray
[1602.36 --> 1603.36]  and read scriptures
[1603.36 --> 1605.04]  it's fascinating to me
[1605.04 --> 1605.76]  that John the Baptist
[1605.76 --> 1606.80]  was to prepare the way
[1606.80 --> 1607.46]  for the Messiah
[1607.46 --> 1608.24]  right
[1608.24 --> 1609.78]  that's an incredible thing
[1609.78 --> 1611.30]  and last time
[1611.30 --> 1612.12]  we had a prophet
[1612.12 --> 1613.22]  we are backing up
[1613.22 --> 1614.54]  400 years
[1614.54 --> 1615.78]  that's in the last book
[1615.78 --> 1616.28]  of the Old Testament
[1616.28 --> 1617.08]  called Malachi
[1617.08 --> 1618.30]  and let's look
[1618.30 --> 1619.40]  what that prophet
[1619.40 --> 1619.88]  says
[1619.88 --> 1621.50]  in Malachi
[1621.50 --> 1622.96]  3 verse 1
[1622.96 --> 1624.72]  where we read this
[1624.72 --> 1627.58]  again 400 years prior
[1627.58 --> 1628.80]  I will send
[1628.80 --> 1630.02]  my messenger
[1630.02 --> 1631.38]  this is God speaking
[1631.38 --> 1632.66]  who will prepare
[1632.66 --> 1633.70]  the way before me
[1633.70 --> 1634.54]  then suddenly
[1634.54 --> 1634.96]  the Lord
[1634.96 --> 1635.58]  you are seeking
[1635.58 --> 1636.32]  will come
[1636.32 --> 1637.40]  to his temple
[1637.40 --> 1638.36]  the messenger
[1638.36 --> 1638.96]  of the covenant
[1638.96 --> 1639.98]  whom you desire
[1639.98 --> 1640.58]  will come
[1640.58 --> 1641.24]  that's Jesus
[1641.24 --> 1642.64]  says the Lord Almighty
[1642.64 --> 1648.12]  and the angel said
[1648.12 --> 1649.20]  in Luke 1
[1649.20 --> 1650.20]  look at Luke 1
[1650.20 --> 1651.12]  back it up
[1651.12 --> 1651.76]  a wee bit here
[1651.76 --> 1653.08]  he says this
[1653.08 --> 1653.80]  of John the Baptist
[1653.80 --> 1655.00]  he will bring back
[1655.00 --> 1655.94]  many people
[1655.94 --> 1656.64]  of Israel
[1656.64 --> 1657.54]  to the Lord
[1657.54 --> 1658.22]  their God
[1658.22 --> 1660.22]  even Zechariah
[1660.22 --> 1660.76]  to a degree
[1660.76 --> 1661.08]  right
[1661.08 --> 1663.04]  and he will go
[1663.04 --> 1663.88]  before the Lord
[1663.88 --> 1664.60]  in spirit
[1664.60 --> 1665.20]  and power
[1665.20 --> 1665.80]  of Elijah
[1665.80 --> 1666.74]  Elijah is
[1666.74 --> 1667.80]  one of the big name
[1667.80 --> 1668.70]  prophets out there
[1668.70 --> 1670.08]  and to turn
[1670.08 --> 1670.70]  the hearts
[1670.70 --> 1671.34]  of parents
[1671.34 --> 1672.12]  to their children
[1672.12 --> 1673.44]  and the disobedient
[1673.44 --> 1674.08]  to the wisdom
[1674.08 --> 1674.76]  of the righteous
[1674.76 --> 1676.32]  to make ready
[1676.32 --> 1676.96]  a people
[1676.96 --> 1677.52]  prepared
[1677.52 --> 1678.80]  for the Lord
[1678.80 --> 1682.80]  a prophet
[1682.80 --> 1683.76]  called by God
[1683.76 --> 1685.34]  to bring people
[1685.34 --> 1685.96]  back
[1685.96 --> 1687.80]  through the ministry
[1687.80 --> 1688.64]  of repentance
[1688.64 --> 1689.46]  and baptism
[1689.46 --> 1690.70]  that's John
[1690.70 --> 1692.56]  a new prophet
[1692.56 --> 1694.88]  Horiah's already
[1694.88 --> 1695.42]  repented
[1695.42 --> 1697.90]  God calls us back
[1697.90 --> 1699.02]  even doubtful
[1699.02 --> 1699.62]  priest
[1699.62 --> 1700.78]  repentance
[1700.78 --> 1702.10]  is the way
[1702.10 --> 1704.80]  I can see him
[1704.80 --> 1706.00]  in his silence
[1706.00 --> 1706.50]  going back
[1706.50 --> 1707.24]  to the scriptures
[1707.24 --> 1708.48]  his whole song
[1708.48 --> 1709.06]  is loaded
[1709.06 --> 1710.24]  with Old Testament
[1710.24 --> 1710.98]  references
[1710.98 --> 1711.50]  right
[1711.50 --> 1713.00]  the line of David
[1713.00 --> 1714.24]  the old prophets
[1714.24 --> 1715.36]  the covenant
[1715.36 --> 1716.08]  with Abraham
[1716.08 --> 1716.64]  the covenant
[1716.64 --> 1717.52]  other covenants
[1717.52 --> 1718.52]  and he sees
[1718.52 --> 1719.46]  his old wife
[1719.46 --> 1720.42]  who's expecting
[1720.42 --> 1721.06]  getting bigger
[1721.06 --> 1721.38]  and bigger
[1721.38 --> 1722.16]  and he sees
[1722.16 --> 1722.88]  God at work
[1722.88 --> 1724.08]  not just in their life
[1724.08 --> 1725.54]  but in the life
[1725.54 --> 1726.58]  of the whole world
[1726.58 --> 1727.86]  throughout history
[1727.86 --> 1728.48]  even history
[1728.48 --> 1729.02]  yet to come
[1729.02 --> 1731.86]  suddenly scripture
[1731.86 --> 1733.32]  and his life
[1733.32 --> 1734.74]  are interwoven
[1734.74 --> 1737.06]  he's not just
[1737.06 --> 1738.26]  reading about
[1738.26 --> 1739.00]  people
[1739.00 --> 1740.12]  he's part
[1740.12 --> 1741.10]  of the story
[1741.10 --> 1744.56]  who could have
[1744.56 --> 1745.72]  imagined all that
[1745.72 --> 1746.58]  but God
[1746.58 --> 1748.24]  and he praises
[1748.24 --> 1749.42]  this incredible God
[1749.42 --> 1751.46]  who he at first
[1751.46 --> 1752.16]  doubted
[1752.16 --> 1753.44]  but right now
[1753.44 --> 1753.88]  he says
[1753.88 --> 1754.82]  he's visited
[1754.82 --> 1756.40]  he's redeemed
[1756.40 --> 1757.42]  this is what
[1757.42 --> 1758.34]  this God is doing
[1758.34 --> 1759.48]  I like that word
[1759.48 --> 1759.88]  visited
[1759.88 --> 1760.88]  it doesn't mean
[1760.88 --> 1761.76]  you know
[1761.76 --> 1762.58]  kind of a come
[1762.58 --> 1763.24]  and go right away
[1763.24 --> 1763.70]  sort of thing
[1763.70 --> 1764.50]  like a quick visit
[1764.50 --> 1766.36]  it means showing up
[1766.36 --> 1769.00]  he came to us
[1769.00 --> 1770.22]  I kind of like
[1770.22 --> 1770.92]  how it's described
[1770.92 --> 1771.84]  in John 1
[1771.84 --> 1773.36]  out of the message
[1773.36 --> 1774.42]  John 1 verse 14
[1774.42 --> 1775.36]  look at it with me
[1775.36 --> 1778.00]  the word became flesh
[1778.00 --> 1778.60]  that's Jesus
[1778.60 --> 1781.60]  became flesh and blood
[1781.60 --> 1782.44]  and moved
[1782.44 --> 1783.66]  into the neighborhood
[1783.66 --> 1784.24]  right
[1784.24 --> 1785.14]  came to us
[1785.14 --> 1785.90]  visited us
[1785.90 --> 1787.44]  we saw the glory
[1787.44 --> 1788.26]  with our own eyes
[1788.26 --> 1789.12]  the one of a kind
[1789.12 --> 1789.72]  glory like
[1789.72 --> 1790.56]  like father
[1790.56 --> 1791.12]  like son
[1791.12 --> 1792.12]  generous inside
[1792.12 --> 1792.44]  and out
[1792.44 --> 1793.30]  true from start
[1793.30 --> 1793.68]  to finish
[1793.68 --> 1794.62]  and then this
[1794.62 --> 1795.74]  and John
[1795.74 --> 1796.78]  pointed him out
[1796.78 --> 1797.32]  and called
[1797.32 --> 1799.44]  this is the one
[1799.44 --> 1801.30]  the one I told you
[1801.30 --> 1801.80]  who was coming
[1801.80 --> 1802.36]  after me
[1802.36 --> 1803.10]  but in fact
[1803.10 --> 1803.88]  was ahead of me
[1803.88 --> 1804.88]  he's always been
[1804.88 --> 1805.36]  ahead of me
[1805.36 --> 1806.44]  he's always had
[1806.44 --> 1807.58]  the first word
[1807.58 --> 1810.06]  God showed up
[1810.06 --> 1810.54]  when Israel
[1810.54 --> 1811.66]  cried out in Egypt
[1811.66 --> 1812.64]  in their slavery
[1812.64 --> 1813.52]  and now God
[1813.52 --> 1814.44]  is showing up
[1814.44 --> 1815.12]  yet again
[1815.12 --> 1817.26]  to free us
[1817.26 --> 1818.22]  to free the world
[1818.22 --> 1819.20]  from the slavery
[1819.20 --> 1819.84]  of sin
[1819.84 --> 1820.78]  and death
[1820.78 --> 1822.52]  the whole story
[1822.52 --> 1822.94]  is of one
[1822.94 --> 1823.42]  of a God
[1823.42 --> 1824.32]  who keeps coming
[1824.32 --> 1825.68]  to rescue us
[1825.68 --> 1826.92]  because of his
[1826.92 --> 1827.66]  great love
[1827.66 --> 1829.14]  from Abraham
[1829.14 --> 1830.40]  to David
[1830.40 --> 1831.60]  to Moses
[1831.60 --> 1832.12]  from Abraham
[1832.12 --> 1832.58]  to Moses
[1832.58 --> 1833.08]  to David
[1833.08 --> 1833.74]  all throughout
[1833.74 --> 1834.20]  scripture
[1834.20 --> 1835.18]  through miracles
[1835.18 --> 1835.80]  through prophets
[1835.80 --> 1836.62]  through hardships
[1836.62 --> 1838.76]  God is at work
[1838.76 --> 1840.56]  he's at work
[1840.56 --> 1842.84]  Zachariah sings
[1842.84 --> 1843.70]  songs about
[1843.70 --> 1844.70]  all of that
[1844.70 --> 1846.20]  God keeps
[1846.20 --> 1847.06]  coming for us
[1847.06 --> 1848.58]  he keeps coming
[1848.58 --> 1849.58]  to the dark
[1849.58 --> 1850.26]  to bring us
[1850.26 --> 1851.24]  into his forever
[1851.24 --> 1851.72]  light
[1851.72 --> 1853.46]  I like that
[1853.46 --> 1856.12]  when in Zachariah's song
[1856.12 --> 1856.84]  he talks about
[1856.84 --> 1858.10]  the light shining
[1858.10 --> 1859.16]  in those who are
[1859.16 --> 1860.14]  sitting in dark
[1860.14 --> 1860.74]  places
[1860.74 --> 1862.32]  it's interesting
[1862.32 --> 1863.24]  that they're sitting
[1863.24 --> 1863.52]  right
[1863.52 --> 1864.54]  the light comes
[1864.54 --> 1865.40]  to us when we've
[1865.40 --> 1866.38]  kind of given up
[1866.38 --> 1868.80]  back to Malachi
[1868.80 --> 1869.50]  last book
[1869.50 --> 1870.44]  book of the Old Testament
[1870.44 --> 1872.12]  where the writer
[1872.12 --> 1872.52]  writes
[1872.52 --> 1873.68]  but for you
[1873.68 --> 1874.86]  who revere my name
[1874.86 --> 1875.46]  here we go
[1875.46 --> 1876.02]  here's the light
[1876.02 --> 1877.70]  the sun of righteousness
[1877.70 --> 1878.42]  will rise
[1878.42 --> 1880.00]  with healing
[1880.00 --> 1880.92]  in its rays
[1880.92 --> 1881.82]  and you will go out
[1881.82 --> 1882.24]  and frolic
[1882.24 --> 1883.28]  like well fed calves
[1883.28 --> 1884.38]  John 1 5
[1884.38 --> 1885.50]  the light shines
[1885.50 --> 1886.06]  in the darkness
[1886.06 --> 1886.78]  and the darkness
[1886.78 --> 1888.36]  has not overcome it
[1888.36 --> 1889.84]  the sun comes
[1889.84 --> 1891.20]  and we have a new day
[1891.20 --> 1891.96]  it's a new day
[1891.96 --> 1892.46]  dawning
[1892.46 --> 1893.82]  for those who sit
[1893.82 --> 1895.24]  in dark places
[1895.24 --> 1898.60]  they've lost their way
[1898.60 --> 1899.98]  they can't find the path
[1899.98 --> 1900.62]  in the darkness
[1900.62 --> 1903.24]  they've given up
[1903.24 --> 1904.44]  so they just sit down
[1904.44 --> 1905.18]  in despair
[1905.18 --> 1908.18]  desperate people
[1908.18 --> 1909.72]  know they need
[1909.72 --> 1910.64]  deliverance
[1910.64 --> 1912.10]  because they can't
[1912.10 --> 1912.74]  rescue
[1912.74 --> 1913.82]  themselves
[1913.82 --> 1915.50]  they're beyond
[1915.50 --> 1916.36]  the illusion
[1916.36 --> 1917.48]  of self
[1917.48 --> 1918.62]  salvation
[1918.62 --> 1921.06]  in Zachariah's song
[1921.06 --> 1922.02]  we see salvation
[1922.02 --> 1923.22]  as God's doing
[1923.22 --> 1923.76]  not ours
[1923.76 --> 1924.90]  God visits
[1924.90 --> 1925.74]  God comes
[1925.74 --> 1926.42]  to redeem
[1926.42 --> 1927.40]  we didn't
[1927.40 --> 1928.00]  find him
[1928.00 --> 1928.86]  God delivers
[1928.86 --> 1929.62]  he plans
[1929.62 --> 1930.38]  he prophesies
[1930.38 --> 1931.50]  he carried it out
[1931.50 --> 1933.34]  he enlightens us
[1933.34 --> 1935.50]  that's what's going on here
[1935.50 --> 1937.24]  all we can do
[1937.24 --> 1939.12]  is receive it
[1939.12 --> 1941.26]  I like how it's spoken of
[1941.26 --> 1941.76]  in Romans
[1941.76 --> 1943.52]  Romans 5
[1943.52 --> 1945.26]  verse 6 to 8
[1945.26 --> 1945.94]  Paul writes
[1945.94 --> 1948.14]  you see at just the right time
[1948.14 --> 1949.86]  when we were still powerless
[1949.86 --> 1952.42]  Christ died for the ungodly
[1952.42 --> 1954.04]  very rarely
[1954.04 --> 1955.34]  will anyone
[1955.34 --> 1956.98]  die for the righteous person
[1956.98 --> 1958.24]  though
[1958.24 --> 1959.72]  for a good person
[1959.72 --> 1960.70]  someone might possibly
[1960.70 --> 1961.40]  dare to die
[1961.40 --> 1962.84]  but God demonstrates
[1962.84 --> 1963.78]  his own love for us
[1963.78 --> 1964.80]  in this
[1964.80 --> 1966.14]  while we were still sinners
[1966.14 --> 1967.32]  Christ died for us
[1967.32 --> 1969.60]  Zachariah spoke
[1969.60 --> 1970.58]  of being delivered
[1970.58 --> 1971.34]  from enemies
[1971.34 --> 1972.02]  and of course
[1972.02 --> 1972.88]  he's thinking of
[1972.88 --> 1974.08]  the people like
[1974.08 --> 1974.88]  the Egyptians
[1974.88 --> 1975.86]  and the Babylonians
[1975.86 --> 1976.28]  and the Greeks
[1976.28 --> 1976.84]  and now the Romans
[1976.84 --> 1977.84]  they've been oppressed
[1977.84 --> 1978.46]  as a people
[1978.46 --> 1979.64]  and many in Israel
[1979.64 --> 1980.34]  were waiting
[1980.34 --> 1982.48]  for a political messiah
[1982.48 --> 1984.12]  to solve the problems
[1984.12 --> 1985.00]  of their day
[1985.00 --> 1986.30]  but salvation
[1986.30 --> 1987.40]  goes deeper than that
[1987.40 --> 1988.62]  notice
[1988.62 --> 1990.06]  because salvation comes
[1990.06 --> 1991.48]  we then live differently
[1991.48 --> 1992.36]  we can serve
[1992.36 --> 1993.52]  without fear
[1993.52 --> 1995.04]  because our sins
[1995.04 --> 1995.50]  are no more
[1995.50 --> 1996.48]  we can serve
[1996.48 --> 1997.12]  in holiness
[1997.12 --> 1998.04]  and righteousness
[1998.04 --> 1999.96]  through the forgiveness
[1999.96 --> 2000.54]  of sins
[2000.54 --> 2002.70]  God saves us
[2002.70 --> 2003.78]  so we might serve
[2003.78 --> 2004.64]  and bless one another
[2004.64 --> 2006.22]  so we might share
[2006.22 --> 2007.00]  in the light
[2007.00 --> 2009.26]  and John's ministry
[2009.26 --> 2010.42]  is one of repentance
[2010.42 --> 2011.22]  and baptism
[2011.22 --> 2013.00]  earlier on
[2013.00 --> 2014.30]  Gabriel had told
[2014.30 --> 2014.82]  Zachariah
[2014.82 --> 2015.84]  many will rejoice
[2015.84 --> 2016.64]  at John's birth
[2016.64 --> 2018.16]  because he will call
[2018.16 --> 2018.92]  people back
[2018.92 --> 2019.76]  to their God
[2019.76 --> 2021.86]  call them to repent
[2021.86 --> 2023.06]  and be cleansed
[2023.06 --> 2024.26]  not in John's name
[2024.26 --> 2025.56]  albeit John's name
[2025.56 --> 2026.02]  is the Lord
[2026.02 --> 2026.60]  is gracious
[2026.60 --> 2028.00]  but in Jesus name
[2028.00 --> 2029.22]  because his name
[2029.22 --> 2030.74]  means to deliver
[2030.74 --> 2031.50]  to rescue
[2031.50 --> 2032.08]  to save
[2032.08 --> 2034.30]  and Zachariah
[2034.30 --> 2034.90]  then says
[2034.90 --> 2035.62]  and I picture him
[2035.62 --> 2036.76]  holding his baby boy
[2036.76 --> 2038.00]  and he says
[2038.00 --> 2039.32]  and you my child
[2039.32 --> 2040.02]  and I see tears
[2040.02 --> 2040.74]  streaming down his face
[2040.74 --> 2041.76]  you my child
[2041.76 --> 2042.20]  will be called
[2042.20 --> 2043.30]  the prophet of Mosiah
[2043.30 --> 2046.72]  and there's a little baby
[2046.72 --> 2046.96]  and he said
[2046.96 --> 2048.50]  so much is going on
[2048.50 --> 2049.38]  and he's holding
[2049.38 --> 2050.22]  this little boy
[2050.22 --> 2050.88]  and he said
[2050.88 --> 2051.48]  you're going to be
[2051.48 --> 2052.42]  a prophet of Mosiah
[2052.42 --> 2053.52]  you're going to lead
[2053.52 --> 2054.12]  the way
[2054.12 --> 2055.68]  to the Messiah
[2055.68 --> 2057.46]  you're going to call
[2057.46 --> 2058.38]  people back
[2058.38 --> 2059.46]  to light
[2059.46 --> 2061.24]  how did
[2061.24 --> 2062.12]  how did that turn out
[2062.12 --> 2062.60]  in John's life
[2062.60 --> 2062.88]  I thought
[2062.88 --> 2063.78]  let's just jump
[2063.78 --> 2064.42]  a little bit here
[2064.42 --> 2066.46]  what does this prophet
[2066.46 --> 2067.44]  do and look like
[2067.44 --> 2069.58]  earlier on
[2069.58 --> 2070.00]  I read you
[2070.00 --> 2070.34]  John
[2070.34 --> 2071.96]  in John 1
[2071.96 --> 2073.00]  let me read it to you again
[2073.00 --> 2074.46]  John pointed him out
[2074.46 --> 2075.08]  he said
[2075.08 --> 2076.16]  this is the one
[2076.16 --> 2077.32]  the one I told you
[2077.32 --> 2078.08]  coming after me
[2078.08 --> 2078.64]  but in fact
[2078.64 --> 2079.14]  was ahead of me
[2079.14 --> 2080.10]  he's always been ahead of me
[2080.10 --> 2081.50]  he's always had the first word
[2081.50 --> 2081.68]  right
[2081.68 --> 2083.14]  this John is pointing to him
[2083.14 --> 2084.56]  we read Luke 3
[2084.56 --> 2086.42]  you'll see a bunch of names here
[2086.42 --> 2088.50]  but it's the context of the day
[2088.50 --> 2089.56]  and the days to come
[2089.56 --> 2089.88]  right
[2089.88 --> 2092.34]  in the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar
[2092.34 --> 2092.98]  so Caesar
[2092.98 --> 2093.56]  we hear that
[2093.56 --> 2094.90]  when Pontius Paul
[2094.90 --> 2095.36]  oh yeah right
[2095.36 --> 2096.26]  I remember that guy
[2096.26 --> 2097.48]  wasn't he at the crucifixion
[2097.48 --> 2097.66]  yeah
[2097.66 --> 2098.88]  governor of Judea
[2098.88 --> 2099.56]  Herod
[2099.56 --> 2099.94]  oh yeah
[2099.94 --> 2100.88]  I remember him too
[2100.88 --> 2103.96]  Tetrarch of Galilee
[2103.96 --> 2105.02]  brother Philip
[2105.02 --> 2106.06]  you know all these guys
[2106.06 --> 2107.58]  doing
[2107.58 --> 2108.88]  and then the high priest
[2108.88 --> 2110.24]  Annas and Caiaphas
[2110.24 --> 2111.96]  and we think of Jesus' crucifixion
[2111.96 --> 2113.82]  and they put Jesus on trial
[2113.82 --> 2114.40]  at some point
[2114.40 --> 2115.66]  the word of God
[2115.66 --> 2116.60]  in all that time
[2116.60 --> 2117.20]  the word of God
[2117.20 --> 2118.26]  came to John
[2118.26 --> 2120.80]  son of Zechariah
[2120.80 --> 2122.58]  in the wilderness
[2122.58 --> 2125.60]  he went into all the country
[2125.60 --> 2126.46]  around Jordan
[2126.46 --> 2127.80]  preaching a baptism
[2127.80 --> 2128.84]  of repentance
[2128.84 --> 2129.80]  for the forgiveness
[2129.80 --> 2131.34]  of sins
[2131.34 --> 2132.38]  he's preparing
[2132.38 --> 2133.64]  the way
[2133.64 --> 2135.82]  John 1 27
[2135.82 --> 2137.58]  he is the one
[2137.58 --> 2138.50]  and point to Jesus again
[2138.50 --> 2138.90]  he is the one
[2138.90 --> 2139.62]  who comes after me
[2139.62 --> 2141.10]  the straps of whose sandals
[2141.10 --> 2142.64]  I'm not worthy to untie
[2142.64 --> 2144.34]  later in John 3 30
[2144.34 --> 2145.22]  John says
[2145.22 --> 2146.06]  pointing to Jesus
[2146.06 --> 2146.54]  yet again
[2146.54 --> 2147.98]  he must become greater
[2147.98 --> 2149.80]  I must become less
[2149.80 --> 2152.52]  in a society
[2152.52 --> 2153.28]  where we all
[2153.28 --> 2153.54]  are
[2153.54 --> 2154.64]  we're often about
[2154.64 --> 2156.42]  making ourselves up high
[2156.42 --> 2158.48]  that's not what's going on here
[2158.48 --> 2161.34]  and I think
[2161.34 --> 2162.20]  I think that's
[2162.20 --> 2162.84]  a great way
[2162.84 --> 2163.86]  to enter the Christmas season
[2163.86 --> 2165.82]  pointing to Jesus
[2165.82 --> 2167.26]  like John did
[2167.26 --> 2169.82]  less about me
[2169.82 --> 2171.94]  more about him
[2171.94 --> 2174.84]  that's what we're called to do
[2174.84 --> 2176.94]  now one more verse
[2176.94 --> 2178.18]  Matthew 11
[2178.18 --> 2180.70]  where Jesus says
[2180.70 --> 2181.88]  truly I tell you
[2181.88 --> 2183.46]  among those born of women
[2183.46 --> 2184.68]  there has not risen anyone
[2184.68 --> 2186.30]  greater than John the Baptist
[2186.30 --> 2188.76]  yet whoever is least
[2188.76 --> 2190.00]  in the kingdom of heaven
[2190.00 --> 2191.62]  is greater than he
[2191.62 --> 2192.58]  what's going on here
[2192.58 --> 2193.10]  you know
[2193.10 --> 2193.82]  we might be saying
[2193.82 --> 2194.48]  wait a minute
[2194.48 --> 2195.38]  I'm sure there are listeners
[2195.38 --> 2196.24]  hearing Jesus said
[2196.24 --> 2197.72]  John greater than Abraham
[2197.72 --> 2198.44]  than Moses
[2198.44 --> 2199.08]  than David
[2199.08 --> 2199.70]  Isaiah
[2199.70 --> 2200.44]  how
[2200.44 --> 2203.08]  because although Abraham
[2203.08 --> 2203.72]  and Moses
[2203.72 --> 2204.12]  and David
[2204.12 --> 2204.50]  and Isaiah
[2204.50 --> 2205.36]  and so on
[2205.36 --> 2206.70]  all pointed to Jesus
[2206.70 --> 2207.80]  in some sense of it
[2207.80 --> 2209.58]  only John the Baptist
[2209.58 --> 2211.42]  was given to say
[2211.42 --> 2212.92]  there
[2212.92 --> 2214.46]  in his life
[2214.46 --> 2214.94]  there
[2214.94 --> 2216.14]  that man right over there
[2216.14 --> 2217.10]  that's him
[2217.10 --> 2220.32]  that's the one
[2220.32 --> 2221.54]  we've been waiting for
[2221.54 --> 2222.60]  for thousands of years
[2222.60 --> 2223.62]  that's him
[2223.62 --> 2227.26]  the Lamb of God
[2227.26 --> 2228.38]  and I'm not worthy
[2228.38 --> 2229.74]  to even touch his sandals
[2229.74 --> 2231.56]  and he must increase
[2231.56 --> 2233.18]  and I must decrease
[2233.18 --> 2234.38]  and then ironically
[2234.38 --> 2235.98]  we arise
[2235.98 --> 2237.32]  with him
[2237.32 --> 2241.22]  John's greatness
[2241.22 --> 2242.26]  is found in pointing
[2242.26 --> 2242.84]  to Jesus
[2242.84 --> 2245.70]  just as Zechariah
[2245.70 --> 2246.28]  sang about
[2246.28 --> 2247.86]  but then you might say
[2247.86 --> 2248.88]  well but how are we
[2248.88 --> 2250.02]  then the least
[2250.02 --> 2250.62]  because that's us
[2250.62 --> 2252.42]  greater than John
[2252.42 --> 2253.68]  what does he mean
[2253.68 --> 2257.32]  because your greatness
[2257.32 --> 2258.02]  my greatness
[2258.02 --> 2259.24]  is also found
[2259.24 --> 2260.90]  in pointing to Jesus
[2260.90 --> 2262.90]  reflecting him
[2262.90 --> 2263.72]  in the way we live
[2263.72 --> 2265.64]  reflecting him
[2265.64 --> 2266.68]  by acknowledging him
[2266.68 --> 2267.40]  as Lord and Savior
[2267.40 --> 2268.98]  and in some sense
[2268.98 --> 2270.04]  we can say more
[2270.04 --> 2270.60]  about Jesus
[2270.60 --> 2271.52]  than John could
[2271.52 --> 2273.22]  John was executed
[2273.22 --> 2274.24]  before Jesus died
[2274.24 --> 2274.82]  and rose again
[2274.82 --> 2276.66]  he never lived
[2276.66 --> 2277.26]  to see the coming
[2277.26 --> 2277.86]  of the Holy Spirit
[2277.86 --> 2278.52]  at Pentecost
[2278.52 --> 2279.92]  he wasn't there
[2279.92 --> 2280.66]  at the ascension
[2280.66 --> 2283.34]  we can point to Jesus
[2283.34 --> 2284.44]  with greater clarity
[2284.44 --> 2285.20]  than he could
[2285.20 --> 2287.44]  and we find ourselves
[2287.44 --> 2288.30]  in Jesus then
[2288.30 --> 2289.86]  and then we tell others
[2289.86 --> 2290.82]  to look to him
[2290.82 --> 2292.22]  in their dark places
[2292.22 --> 2293.30]  so they can live life
[2293.30 --> 2294.64]  in all its fullness
[2294.64 --> 2295.26]  too
[2295.26 --> 2297.88]  this Jesus
[2297.88 --> 2298.70]  whom we celebrate
[2298.70 --> 2299.22]  at Christmas
[2299.22 --> 2301.50]  he came to us
[2301.50 --> 2302.88]  in our darkness
[2302.88 --> 2304.32]  and he showed us
[2304.32 --> 2305.02]  the path
[2305.02 --> 2305.94]  to peace
[2305.94 --> 2306.32]  that's what
[2306.32 --> 2307.52]  Zechariah is saying
[2307.52 --> 2307.66]  about
[2307.66 --> 2308.50]  he shows us
[2308.50 --> 2309.08]  the path
[2309.08 --> 2309.68]  to peace
[2309.68 --> 2311.12]  and we get to do
[2311.12 --> 2311.88]  the same thing
[2311.88 --> 2312.46]  for others
[2312.46 --> 2317.16]  let me encourage you
[2317.16 --> 2318.02]  in this season
[2318.02 --> 2319.86]  of busyness
[2319.86 --> 2321.50]  find some time
[2321.50 --> 2322.72]  to practice silence
[2322.72 --> 2325.36]  so that like Zechariah
[2325.36 --> 2326.38]  you may ponder
[2326.38 --> 2327.28]  God's greatness
[2327.28 --> 2328.78]  God's love
[2328.78 --> 2330.28]  God's eternal purposes
[2330.28 --> 2331.98]  for our lives
[2331.98 --> 2334.56]  pray together
[2334.56 --> 2337.62]  Lord God
[2337.62 --> 2338.58]  we come before you
[2338.58 --> 2340.62]  and we thank you
[2340.62 --> 2340.86]  Lord
[2340.86 --> 2342.86]  for coming to us
[2342.86 --> 2344.38]  we thank you
[2344.38 --> 2345.82]  for your incredible story
[2345.82 --> 2348.86]  of restoration
[2348.86 --> 2349.76]  of redemption
[2349.76 --> 2350.92]  of wholeness
[2350.92 --> 2352.54]  we thank you
[2352.54 --> 2353.56]  that you invite us
[2353.56 --> 2354.24]  to partake
[2354.24 --> 2355.00]  in your story
[2355.00 --> 2356.90]  that you invite us
[2356.90 --> 2358.10]  to share the good news
[2358.10 --> 2358.72]  of the gospel
[2358.72 --> 2359.42]  with others
[2359.42 --> 2361.44]  we thank you
[2361.44 --> 2361.80]  Lord
[2361.80 --> 2363.60]  that you
[2363.60 --> 2366.64]  that you are the one
[2366.64 --> 2368.66]  who sent your son
[2368.66 --> 2370.34]  to be one of us
[2370.34 --> 2372.20]  to die for us
[2372.20 --> 2373.24]  and to rise again
[2373.24 --> 2374.52]  so that we might
[2374.52 --> 2375.42]  have eternal favor
[2375.42 --> 2377.22]  Lord I pray
[2377.22 --> 2378.00]  that we might
[2378.00 --> 2378.82]  reflect on that
[2378.82 --> 2379.42]  this season
[2379.42 --> 2380.80]  and share it
[2380.80 --> 2381.22]  with others
[2381.22 --> 2382.16]  in Jesus name
[2382.16 --> 2382.70]  Amen
[2382.70 --> 2383.16]  Amen
[2383.16 --> 2395.78]  Amen
[2395.78 --> 2397.72]  Amen
[2397.72 --> 2427.70]  Thank you.
[2427.72 --> 2457.70]  Thank you.
[2457.72 --> 2487.70]  Thank you.
[2487.72 --> 2489.72]  Thank you.
[2517.72 --> 2519.72]  Thank you.
[2547.72 --> 2549.72]  Thank you.
[2577.72 --> 2579.72]  Thank you.
[2607.72 --> 2609.72]  Thank you.
[2609.72 --> 2611.72]  Thank you.
[2611.72 --> 2613.72]  Thank you.
[2639.72 --> 2641.72]  Thank you.
[2669.72 --> 2671.72]  Thank you.
[2699.72 --> 2705.72]  Thank you.
[2705.72 --> 2707.72]  Thank you.
[2707.72 --> 2711.40]  Let the world shine, shine, shine
[2711.40 --> 2715.40]  I'll open the ocean, right, right, right
[2715.40 --> 2719.80]  I'll be in the light of the world
[2719.80 --> 2728.60]  In the heart of our world
[2737.72 --> 2749.54]  Well, if that wasn't enough blessing, I'll give you a blessing
[2749.54 --> 2752.18]  Lovely
[2752.18 --> 2757.06]  Would you rise and receive God's blessing?
[2762.56 --> 2765.78]  May you experience his tender mercy
[2765.78 --> 2769.14]  His forgiveness of sins
[2769.14 --> 2771.34]  His salvation, his light
[2771.34 --> 2773.74]  May the Holy Spirit guide you
[2773.74 --> 2776.54]  And may you follow his path of peace
[2776.54 --> 2780.46]  May you call out when you find yourself in dark places
[2780.46 --> 2783.60]  Trusting his light to lead you to wholeness yet again
[2783.60 --> 2786.80]  And may your life point to him
[2786.80 --> 2789.32]  The Prince of Peace, Emmanuel
[2789.32 --> 2791.00]  God with us
[2795.78 --> 2804.18]  Shepherds kept there watching
[2804.18 --> 2808.66]  For silent logs by night
[2808.66 --> 2813.08]  Behold, throughout the heavens
[2813.08 --> 2818.22]  There shone a holy light
[2818.22 --> 2819.22]  The Prince of Peace, Emmanuel
[2819.22 --> 2820.22]  And may your life point to him
[2820.22 --> 2821.30]  And may your life point to him
[2821.30 --> 2822.22]  The Prince of Peace, Emmanuel
[2822.22 --> 2824.66]  Tell it, I'm a king
[2824.66 --> 2828.18]  Over the hills and everywhere
[2828.18 --> 2829.58]  And go
[2829.58 --> 2833.18]  Now we're going down to the hills and the hills right to the hills
[2833.18 --> 2834.58]  The Prince of Peace, Emmanuel
[2834.58 --> 2835.56]  The Prince of Peace, Emmanuel
[2835.56 --> 2839.78]  The shepherds feared and trembled
[2839.78 --> 2843.68]  When low above the earth
[2843.68 --> 2847.60]  Brang out the angels for us
[2847.60 --> 2851.64]  That hailed our Savior's name
[2851.64 --> 2853.68]  Go
[2853.68 --> 2855.12]  Go
[2855.12 --> 2855.68]  Go
[2855.68 --> 2856.68]  Go
[2856.68 --> 2857.68]  Go
[2857.68 --> 2858.68]  Go
[2858.68 --> 2859.68]  Go
[2859.68 --> 2860.68]  Go
[2860.68 --> 2861.68]  Go
[2861.68 --> 2862.68]  Go
[2862.68 --> 2863.68]  Go
[2863.68 --> 2864.68]  Go
[2864.68 --> 2865.68]  Go
[2865.68 --> 2866.68]  Go
[2866.68 --> 2867.68]  Go
[2867.68 --> 2868.68]  Go
[2868.68 --> 2869.68]  Go
[2869.68 --> 2870.68]  Go
[2870.68 --> 2871.68]  Go
[2871.68 --> 2896.68]  Go
[2896.68 --> 2898.68]  Go
[2898.68 --> 2901.12]  Jesus Christ is born.
[2902.42 --> 2905.12]  Go tell it on the mountain.
[2906.12 --> 2909.60]  Over the hills and every day.
[2910.12 --> 2913.00]  No tell it on the mountain.
[2913.00 --> 2916.40]  But Jesus Christ is born.
[2917.34 --> 2921.64]  But Jesus Christ is born.
[2926.28 --> 2928.24]  Go tell it on the mountain.
[2928.68 --> 2930.56]  That Jesus Christ is born.
[2931.06 --> 2931.86]  Go in peace.
[2932.50 --> 2936.24]  cuma word is born.
[2936.24 --> 2937.64]  So, God bless you.
[2937.64 --> 2967.62]  Thank you.
[2967.64 --> 2997.62]  Thank you.
