[0.00 → 5.82] Good morning, Hope.
[9.62 → 13.00] This morning we get to continue our series on the Beatitudes.
[13.38 → 15.14] And last week we had a guest preacher,
[15.66 → 20.26] and I think it was very appropriate that our guest pastor, Todd,
[20.90 → 22.92] preached on the ascension of Christ.
[23.10 → 26.66] And it was a good reminder that, yes, Jesus is victorious,
[26.66 → 30.26] and he sits at the right hand of God the Father out there,
[30.74 → 32.22] seemingly absent from us.
[32.54 → 35.52] And we can mourn because of that, and we can be sad.
[36.06 → 38.76] But his reminder was that he is here with us now.
[39.42 → 41.72] And so it's a great reminder,
[42.08 → 45.96] and it relates very well to our Beatitude this morning.
[46.20 → 48.58] It's only one verse, so if you have your Bibles,
[48.68 → 51.04] you can turn with me to Matthew chapter 5,
[51.46 → 53.98] but allow me to read this verse for us.
[53.98 → 57.38] Read and hear the Word of God.
[58.02 → 62.28] Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[63.78 → 66.92] Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[67.20 → 68.72] And when you read this blessing,
[69.12 → 72.66] so if somebody were to give you this specific Beatitude to reflect on,
[73.04 → 75.86] what would be the initial thoughts that come to your mind?
[76.56 → 78.48] Because I can paraphrase this,
[78.90 → 81.78] and hopefully it induces some deeper thought.
[81.78 → 84.66] But if you paraphrase it, it could sound like,
[85.10 → 90.28] so happy, congratulations to you who are weeping,
[90.98 → 94.90] who are in deep grieving as if you lost a loved one.
[95.78 → 97.82] Congratulations, you must be so happy.
[99.44 → 104.18] It's sort of weird that Jesus follows up the first Beatitude with this one.
[104.18 → 107.18] And to remind you what our first Beatitude was,
[107.28 → 108.62] remember, poor in spirit.
[109.00 → 109.72] You're blessed.
[110.18 → 114.24] You gain true blessing as you are poor in spirit.
[114.40 → 115.22] Utter dependence.
[115.54 → 118.76] You have no way to save yourselves, and you know it.
[119.26 → 119.92] Blessed are you.
[120.10 → 122.08] And also, to add on top of that,
[122.40 → 124.14] blessed are you who weep,
[124.64 → 125.52] who mourn,
[125.52 → 127.72] mourn, and are in deep sadness.
[127.72 → 134.96] Think again about what true blessing means.
[135.52 → 136.76] What is blessing?
[138.22 → 142.74] And as I was reflecting on this Beatitude in particular this week,
[143.40 → 145.84] it was very timely that one of our young adults,
[145.88 → 147.68] I was playing the bass up here today, Marcus,
[148.08 → 150.16] he sent me just randomly out of the blue
[150.16 → 151.92] as he's journeying with a new Christian,
[152.22 → 153.08] a friend in his life.
[153.16 → 153.74] He's like, hey,
[154.10 → 156.56] I was thinking about this friend I have,
[156.56 → 157.44] he's a new believer,
[157.80 → 159.20] and this quote was sent to me.
[159.26 → 160.24] I want to share it with you.
[160.82 → 162.94] And I thought, wow, this is really timely.
[163.30 → 166.48] This reflects a lot about our Beatitude this morning.
[167.12 → 168.52] And so, to read this quote,
[170.18 → 170.90] the first line,
[171.04 → 173.24] he who has felt the deepest grief
[173.24 → 177.08] is best able to experience supreme happiness.
[177.36 → 179.00] I'll read that first line just once again.
[179.42 → 181.64] He who has felt the deepest grief
[181.64 → 185.44] is best able to experience supreme happiness.
[185.44 → 188.48] We must have felt what it is to die
[188.48 → 191.48] that we may appreciate the enjoyments of life.
[192.60 → 194.00] Live then and be happy,
[194.54 → 195.74] beloved children of my heart,
[195.86 → 198.68] and never forget that until the day
[198.68 → 201.58] God will deign to reveal the future to man,
[201.86 → 205.36] all human wisdom is contained in these two words,
[206.12 → 207.74] wait and hope.
[208.78 → 209.80] Wait and hope.
[209.88 → 210.46] That's beautiful.
[210.46 → 213.16] And I think this quote reflects
[213.16 → 215.40] a lot of what Jesus is trying to tell us
[215.40 → 216.72] with this Beatitude.
[217.08 → 220.38] Blessed, happy are for those who mourn.
[221.26 → 224.18] Remember, our identity and our calling
[224.18 → 227.38] is to be a blessed people.
[228.54 → 230.22] And just a reminder once again,
[230.46 → 231.28] this blessing,
[231.56 → 234.02] all these qualities that we will talk about in our series,
[234.36 → 235.94] to be truly blessed people
[235.94 → 239.28] are not a result of us being good enough
[239.28 → 240.44] and God saying,
[240.64 → 241.74] okay, now you're good enough.
[241.86 → 242.86] Now I will bless you.
[243.56 → 245.16] No, it's the other way around.
[246.14 → 248.18] We are blessed because
[248.18 → 251.62] it is a result of God calling us into His kingdom,
[252.08 → 253.62] calling us into His family,
[253.88 → 255.22] and the result is,
[255.78 → 257.14] is this true blessing.
[257.88 → 259.16] The result is
[259.16 → 260.96] in us being blessed
[260.96 → 263.66] and to share in His likeness,
[263.86 → 265.32] to be Christ-like,
[265.42 → 266.16] we say in church,
[266.62 → 267.78] to share in His likeness.
[268.56 → 270.44] And part of this likeness
[270.44 → 272.56] we want to reflect on today
[272.56 → 274.60] is to share God's heart,
[275.06 → 277.10] to share God's heart
[277.10 → 278.12] for ourselves,
[278.50 → 279.50] for one another,
[279.86 → 281.32] and for our world,
[282.02 → 283.34] to share God's heart.
[283.76 → 284.96] And God's heart
[284.96 → 286.76] mourns.
[286.76 → 289.58] God mourns.
[291.00 → 292.88] God passionately grieves
[292.88 → 293.80] what this word means.
[294.26 → 295.72] God passionately grieves
[295.72 → 296.72] at the brokenness
[296.72 → 297.90] of His good creation
[297.90 → 299.42] because He knows
[299.42 → 301.36] and now has let us know
[301.36 → 303.74] that this is not the way
[303.74 → 304.62] it's supposed to be.
[305.20 → 305.88] You're going to hear me
[305.88 → 306.74] say this a lot today.
[307.10 → 308.46] It's not the way
[308.46 → 309.76] it's supposed to be.
[310.96 → 312.18] The good creation
[312.18 → 314.16] that was made by God
[314.16 → 315.02] in the beginning
[315.02 → 316.16] is now broken
[316.16 → 317.30] and falls short
[317.30 → 318.56] of God's glory,
[318.84 → 319.66] His beautiful,
[319.92 → 320.84] perfect design.
[322.30 → 323.52] It's not the way
[323.52 → 324.34] it's supposed to be
[324.34 → 325.26] and seeing all
[325.26 → 327.04] the broken relationships
[327.04 → 328.50] with God Himself,
[329.00 → 329.90] with one another,
[330.26 → 331.60] with the rest of creation,
[331.98 → 333.12] God mourns
[333.12 → 335.76] and now calls us
[335.76 → 337.06] to mourn with Him.
[338.02 → 339.04] That's blessing.
[339.04 → 341.86] And the good news,
[341.98 → 343.10] this gospel story
[343.10 → 344.42] doesn't end here.
[345.82 → 347.30] God promises us
[347.30 → 348.26] the second part
[348.26 → 349.10] of this beatitude,
[349.74 → 350.68] blessed are those
[350.68 → 351.40] who mourn
[351.40 → 353.00] for they will be
[353.00 → 354.56] comforted.
[355.90 → 357.62] God promises us
[357.62 → 358.34] comfort
[358.34 → 359.88] as He Himself
[359.88 → 360.94] mourns with us.
[361.46 → 362.36] He doesn't say,
[362.44 → 363.38] and this is very important
[363.38 → 363.74] as well,
[363.94 → 364.68] He doesn't say
[364.68 → 365.28] that He will just
[365.28 → 365.94] take away
[365.94 → 366.90] all the sadness
[366.90 → 367.72] and the pain
[367.72 → 368.30] right now,
[369.18 → 370.54] but that He will
[370.54 → 371.10] meet us
[371.10 → 372.06] where we are,
[372.34 → 373.48] wherever we are
[373.48 → 374.46] in our brokenness,
[374.56 → 375.24] in our journeys.
[375.58 → 376.56] He says that He will
[376.56 → 378.30] mourn wherever we are
[378.30 → 379.26] with us
[379.26 → 381.24] and He comforts us
[381.24 → 382.12] as He mourns.
[383.44 → 384.28] And that's why
[384.28 → 385.58] God's Holy Spirit,
[386.22 → 387.44] God's sweet spirit
[387.44 → 388.14] that Nana prayed
[388.14 → 388.90] for us this morning,
[388.96 → 389.76] I love that phrase,
[390.10 → 391.46] God's sweet spirit,
[392.30 → 393.44] He's given the title,
[393.68 → 394.24] I don't know if you've
[394.24 → 394.84] heard this before,
[395.08 → 395.70] Paraclete.
[396.04 → 397.54] It's a Greek word,
[398.04 → 398.66] Paraclete,
[398.84 → 399.74] and it simply means
[399.74 → 400.46] comforter,
[401.36 → 402.02] Paraclete.
[403.16 → 404.56] And this same root,
[405.10 → 405.74] Paraclete,
[405.84 → 407.10] is used in our
[407.10 → 407.78] verse this morning.
[407.90 → 408.66] Blessed are those
[408.66 → 409.26] who mourn
[409.26 → 410.44] for they will be
[410.44 → 411.64] paracalosanti,
[411.86 → 413.30] paracalosanti,
[413.90 → 414.68] Paraclete.
[415.14 → 416.30] You will be comforted
[416.30 → 418.20] by His Holy Spirit.
[420.52 → 422.06] And so if we share,
[422.46 → 423.18] and when we share,
[423.18 → 423.70] I should say,
[424.04 → 424.76] God's heart
[424.76 → 425.84] and we mourn with Him,
[426.22 → 427.58] we shall be comforted.
[428.70 → 429.46] And ultimately,
[430.04 → 430.84] God's Spirit
[430.84 → 431.84] comforts us
[431.84 → 433.08] with the hope
[433.08 → 433.76] we have
[433.76 → 434.74] in Jesus Christ
[434.74 → 436.40] because the gospel
[436.40 → 437.74] story doesn't end
[437.74 → 439.30] on the mourning part.
[439.48 → 440.06] It doesn't say,
[440.18 → 440.96] blessed are you
[440.96 → 441.96] who mourn,
[442.14 → 442.40] period.
[443.04 → 444.30] Be sad all the time,
[444.36 → 445.22] that's all you have.
[446.44 → 448.80] No, it doesn't end there.
[449.40 → 450.78] God promised us
[450.78 → 451.60] and has already
[451.60 → 453.00] achieved victory.
[453.18 → 454.92] through Christ's work
[454.92 → 455.70] on the cross,
[455.82 → 457.32] that He has one victory
[457.32 → 458.02] over sin,
[458.34 → 459.28] one sin for all.
[459.56 → 461.18] And so this gospel message
[461.18 → 463.26] is a message of victory,
[463.44 → 463.70] yes,
[463.90 → 465.08] and we are joyful
[465.08 → 466.54] in the hope that we have.
[468.00 → 469.28] But we cannot
[469.28 → 470.36] be naive
[470.36 → 472.22] and just rush past
[472.22 → 474.54] the actual blessing part
[474.54 → 475.30] where He says,
[475.72 → 476.74] that you will mourn.
[476.74 → 479.74] to rush past
[479.74 → 480.42] this part
[480.42 → 481.16] of mourning,
[481.52 → 482.54] to rush past
[482.54 → 483.16] the reality
[483.16 → 483.74] of sin,
[483.98 → 484.80] which we will talk
[484.80 → 485.34] about today,
[485.86 → 486.70] is to be naive
[486.70 → 487.38] and think that
[487.38 → 488.42] when we become Christians,
[489.38 → 490.60] everything falls
[490.60 → 491.64] into place perfectly
[491.64 → 492.94] and we get to enjoy
[492.94 → 493.48] a perfect,
[493.70 → 494.36] prosperous life.
[495.66 → 496.12] Now,
[496.18 → 497.06] if that were true,
[497.72 → 498.84] if that were true,
[498.90 → 499.72] when you become Christian,
[499.80 → 500.58] everything is said.
[500.92 → 501.80] No more problems,
[501.90 → 502.52] no more suffering
[502.52 → 502.98] or pain.
[503.90 → 504.96] How's it going for you?
[506.40 → 507.96] Is everything all peachy
[507.96 → 509.16] because you are a Christian?
[511.52 → 513.20] When we're all about victory
[513.20 → 514.20] and being joyful
[514.20 → 515.64] for what we are promised
[515.64 → 516.20] in Jesus
[516.20 → 517.20] and enjoying
[517.20 → 518.24] what we think
[518.24 → 519.80] are blessed lives
[519.80 → 521.26] in our own judgment,
[521.84 → 523.30] we sometimes tend to,
[523.98 → 525.26] we sometimes end up
[525.26 → 525.98] forgetting
[525.98 → 527.34] about the suffering,
[527.50 → 527.92] the pain,
[527.98 → 529.00] and the real grieving
[529.00 → 530.42] that happens every day
[530.42 → 531.76] all around us.
[532.66 → 533.76] And we sometimes think
[533.76 → 534.60] that we have this
[534.60 → 535.36] blessing thing
[535.36 → 536.32] all figured out
[536.32 → 538.30] when there is a seeming
[538.30 → 539.68] absence of suffering
[539.68 → 540.82] or at least
[540.82 → 541.72] we hide it
[541.72 → 542.64] and we pretend
[542.64 → 543.96] that there is no suffering.
[546.28 → 546.70] And so,
[546.82 → 547.68] here's the significance.
[548.20 → 549.18] Here's why we have
[549.18 → 550.28] these arrows up here
[550.28 → 551.00] representing
[551.00 → 552.24] our Beatitude series.
[552.62 → 553.46] Jesus is taking
[553.46 → 555.46] that upside-down idea
[555.46 → 556.70] of thinking that
[556.70 → 557.76] blessing,
[558.06 → 558.88] it means
[558.88 → 559.64] an absence
[559.64 → 560.52] of all suffering
[560.52 → 561.38] and mourning and pain.
[561.80 → 563.58] Jesus is reversing that
[563.58 → 564.34] and He's saying,
[564.72 → 564.84] no,
[565.02 → 566.26] blessed are those
[566.26 → 567.42] who mourn,
[568.48 → 570.10] who mourn with me
[570.10 → 572.28] just like God mourns.
[572.66 → 574.20] We share in His likeness.
[574.76 → 575.42] And here's
[575.42 → 576.88] the amazing part.
[577.32 → 577.80] God,
[578.34 → 579.04] like us,
[579.26 → 580.12] He mourns,
[580.52 → 581.38] but He mourns
[581.38 → 582.78] with the full knowledge
[582.78 → 583.68] that the victory
[583.68 → 584.30] is one
[584.30 → 585.06] that we talked about.
[585.36 → 586.20] Jesus' work
[586.20 → 587.04] on the cross
[587.04 → 588.12] to defeat sin
[588.12 → 588.88] once and for all.
[588.88 → 590.06] God Himself
[590.06 → 591.52] achieved that victory.
[592.70 → 593.58] He did it.
[594.64 → 595.00] Yet,
[595.26 → 596.22] He mourns.
[597.82 → 599.14] And that's the message
[599.14 → 599.56] for us.
[599.64 → 600.78] That is the encouragement
[600.78 → 601.30] for us.
[601.58 → 603.04] We mourn with God
[603.04 → 604.66] knowing we have
[604.66 → 606.12] full promise
[606.12 → 606.98] of victory,
[607.50 → 608.62] but we mourn
[608.62 → 609.62] what is now.
[609.62 → 612.70] So,
[613.00 → 614.12] after getting
[614.12 → 615.14] that part across,
[615.24 → 615.44] okay,
[615.56 → 615.80] fine,
[615.88 → 616.10] God,
[616.20 → 616.64] You mourn
[616.64 → 617.20] and You mourn
[617.20 → 617.70] with us
[617.70 → 618.88] and You call us
[618.88 → 619.42] to mourn
[619.42 → 620.10] to share
[620.10 → 621.32] Your heart.
[622.32 → 622.84] So,
[622.90 → 623.56] I had to ask,
[623.74 → 623.92] okay,
[624.00 → 624.26] God,
[624.34 → 625.10] what do You mourn
[625.10 → 625.60] for then?
[626.54 → 627.68] What do You mourn
[627.68 → 628.32] for exactly?
[629.26 → 630.14] What are we then
[630.14 → 630.90] called to mourn
[630.90 → 631.64] with You about?
[631.64 → 635.28] And in churches today,
[635.42 → 636.70] we usually tend
[636.70 → 637.46] to use the word
[637.46 → 638.00] broken
[638.00 → 639.54] to express sin.
[640.78 → 641.02] So,
[641.14 → 642.70] God mourns
[642.70 → 643.44] with us
[643.44 → 644.72] as we experience
[644.72 → 645.74] brokenness,
[645.86 → 646.52] as we say.
[647.64 → 648.70] And the biblical term
[648.70 → 649.80] for this,
[650.14 → 650.82] brokenness,
[651.18 → 652.74] is the word sin.
[655.58 → 656.56] Simply put,
[656.68 → 657.44] God mourns
[657.44 → 658.76] because of sin.
[659.76 → 660.54] And I think,
[660.68 → 661.52] and I want to suggest
[661.52 → 662.62] that to fully grasp
[662.62 → 663.30] the goodness
[663.30 → 665.18] of the gospel message,
[665.56 → 666.96] to grasp how good
[666.96 → 669.04] this true blessing is,
[669.20 → 670.08] to experience
[670.08 → 670.60] and know
[670.60 → 671.22] what it means
[671.22 → 672.78] to be right side up,
[673.06 → 674.40] in sync with God's will
[674.40 → 675.20] type of people,
[675.48 → 676.56] we need to know
[676.56 → 677.82] what sin is,
[678.26 → 679.16] what it means,
[679.46 → 680.84] how it affects our lives,
[680.94 → 681.46] how it affects
[681.46 → 682.46] the whole world.
[683.28 → 684.00] And sadly,
[684.00 → 685.00] many churches
[685.00 → 686.16] don't talk about sin.
[688.44 → 688.74] And so,
[688.98 → 690.84] sin is simply defined
[690.84 → 692.38] we pull two
[692.38 → 694.18] ancient words out.
[694.60 → 694.80] So,
[694.88 → 695.34] from the Hebrew
[695.34 → 695.78] data
[695.78 → 697.08] and the Greek
[697.08 → 697.78] Samaria,
[697.90 → 698.76] those two words
[698.76 → 699.82] simply mean
[699.82 → 701.82] to miss the mark.
[702.26 → 702.80] That's it.
[703.36 → 704.20] To miss the mark.
[704.40 → 704.62] Like,
[704.66 → 705.32] you're throwing darts,
[705.42 → 705.90] you're supposed to
[705.90 → 706.52] maybe hit the middle,
[706.78 → 707.68] but you miss it.
[707.94 → 709.22] That's what sin means.
[709.72 → 709.90] So,
[709.96 → 710.88] if there is a specific
[710.88 → 712.24] destination or goal,
[712.30 → 712.90] like a mark,
[713.46 → 714.74] to sin is to miss
[714.74 → 715.42] that mark.
[716.86 → 718.00] Whatever that goal is.
[718.00 → 718.12] So,
[718.12 → 718.84] that's the question
[718.84 → 719.68] you want to be asking.
[720.00 → 720.20] Then,
[720.26 → 720.88] what's the goal?
[721.16 → 721.94] What are we missing
[721.94 → 722.70] when we're sinning?
[724.36 → 725.38] The goal,
[726.02 → 726.90] the ultimate goal,
[727.12 → 728.56] that the Bible teaches us
[728.56 → 729.70] is that for humans,
[730.18 → 731.42] created by God
[731.42 → 732.70] in His image,
[733.38 → 735.22] is first to love God
[735.22 → 736.64] with all of our hearts,
[736.84 → 738.12] with all of our being,
[738.46 → 739.22] to love,
[739.72 → 740.90] to fully love God.
[742.16 → 743.38] And then God says,
[743.46 → 744.78] the second most important thing
[744.78 → 746.04] is to love one another.
[746.54 → 746.90] Why?
[747.54 → 749.00] Because we're all created
[749.00 → 750.14] in God's image.
[751.12 → 752.12] Beautifully distinct,
[752.24 → 755.08] yet created in our God's image.
[755.34 → 755.66] And so,
[755.66 → 756.72] to love one another
[756.72 → 758.88] is actually to love God.
[759.88 → 760.64] Flip that around.
[760.84 → 762.00] To not love one another,
[762.12 → 763.52] to fail to love one another,
[763.96 → 764.24] sin,
[764.78 → 766.26] is too then to fail
[766.26 → 767.20] to love God.
[768.00 → 769.12] That's 1 John.
[769.12 → 771.20] And so,
[771.32 → 771.72] to sin
[771.72 → 773.16] is to fail,
[773.54 → 774.38] to miss the mark
[774.38 → 775.44] of loving God and others.
[775.90 → 777.02] And the sad part
[777.02 → 777.70] about sin,
[778.20 → 779.26] this is the sad part.
[779.32 → 780.52] It's not as simple as this.
[781.04 → 781.26] Okay,
[781.32 → 781.92] here's the mark.
[782.04 → 782.18] Okay,
[782.30 → 783.36] love God,
[783.46 → 783.82] love others.
[783.88 → 784.62] That's easy enough.
[785.68 → 787.20] But the sad part
[787.20 → 788.00] of sin
[788.00 → 788.64] is that
[788.64 → 790.44] we sometimes think
[790.44 → 791.44] we know
[791.44 → 792.54] how to hit that mark
[792.54 → 793.66] or
[793.66 → 795.20] we've hit it
[795.20 → 796.26] and
[796.26 → 797.40] we're all good.
[797.66 → 798.54] We've done our part.
[798.54 → 799.70] We're not sinning.
[801.64 → 802.96] You may ask yourself,
[803.10 → 803.68] like I did,
[804.08 → 804.92] is the world
[804.92 → 806.20] really broken with sin?
[806.96 → 808.58] It seems okay enough.
[808.68 → 809.44] My life is fine.
[810.12 → 810.78] We manage.
[811.02 → 811.76] We're not perfect.
[811.90 → 812.18] Fine.
[812.56 → 813.36] But we manage.
[813.80 → 814.84] Is it really sinful?
[816.24 → 817.76] Are we really sinful?
[819.54 → 820.66] Why are you telling me
[820.66 → 821.24] that the Bible
[821.24 → 821.88] and,
[822.18 → 822.56] like I said,
[822.62 → 823.28] hopefully churches,
[823.44 → 824.28] hopefully churches,
[824.68 → 825.84] why do they keep telling me
[825.84 → 826.44] that I'm a sinner?
[827.40 → 828.48] I'm a good person.
[828.56 → 829.00] I try.
[831.56 → 833.06] Some practical examples
[833.06 → 834.44] to maybe help us relate
[834.44 → 836.26] to what sin looks like.
[837.14 → 838.34] I'll start with a lighter one.
[838.76 → 838.90] So,
[839.02 → 840.44] take a look at these instruments here.
[841.00 → 841.94] You have the drums
[841.94 → 843.28] and you have the guitar,
[843.48 → 844.38] electric guitar,
[844.70 → 845.94] and you have the bass guitar.
[847.04 → 848.04] Churches in the past
[848.04 → 849.46] have condemned
[849.46 → 850.90] these evil instruments
[850.90 → 852.66] as instruments of the devil.
[853.34 → 854.28] In their effort,
[854.78 → 855.38] and I'm a drummer,
[855.38 → 856.40] I play drums
[856.40 → 857.38] more than half my life,
[857.66 → 859.08] so I felt a little bit of that,
[859.18 → 859.92] not too much.
[860.76 → 861.58] But what was the church
[861.58 → 862.10] trying to do?
[862.26 → 863.74] Just hate on these instruments
[863.74 → 864.46] because they don't like
[864.46 → 864.94] these people?
[866.16 → 866.56] Maybe.
[867.16 → 867.48] Maybe.
[867.56 → 868.08] Hopefully not.
[868.34 → 869.22] But their point was
[869.22 → 870.80] to try and keep the church pure,
[871.10 → 872.58] what they thought was pure,
[872.78 → 874.22] to try and love God,
[874.46 → 876.02] hit that mark of loving God.
[877.36 → 878.28] Another example,
[878.42 → 879.00] more serious,
[879.00 → 880.42] is the churches,
[880.98 → 881.38] us,
[882.16 → 883.08] our past churches
[883.08 → 884.06] used to condemn
[884.06 → 886.30] and literally hang people,
[886.74 → 887.54] execute them,
[887.66 → 888.46] because they had
[888.46 → 889.48] different doctrines
[889.48 → 891.56] and different theological perspectives.
[893.36 → 895.00] In the name of love,
[895.28 → 897.04] we killed one another.
[898.18 → 898.44] Well,
[898.48 → 899.48] we don't do that now.
[900.08 → 900.82] When was the last time
[900.82 → 901.68] you've seen somebody
[901.68 → 902.86] being hung
[902.86 → 903.90] because they had
[903.90 → 905.76] different theological views?
[906.04 → 906.74] That'd be terrible.
[906.74 → 908.38] So we're okay now.
[908.98 → 909.50] Churches today
[909.50 → 910.92] don't sin like that,
[911.02 → 911.36] do they?
[912.36 → 913.58] We're trying.
[913.78 → 914.16] We're better
[914.16 → 915.10] at loving one another.
[915.54 → 916.30] That's why
[916.30 → 917.40] we only have
[917.40 → 919.32] about 45,000 denominations
[919.32 → 919.80] globally
[919.80 → 920.76] because we've done
[920.76 → 921.54] a great job
[921.54 → 922.42] of loving one another
[922.42 → 923.42] and staying in unity
[923.42 → 924.30] and representing
[924.30 → 925.58] the body of Christ.
[925.78 → 927.58] It's not bodies of Christ.
[927.78 → 929.04] It's a body of Christ.
[929.68 → 930.18] And I don't think
[930.18 → 931.54] 45 denominations
[931.54 → 933.18] and all the thousands
[933.18 → 934.48] and thousands of churches
[934.48 → 936.08] within those denominations,
[936.08 → 936.84] I don't think
[936.84 → 937.66] that's what it was
[937.66 → 938.48] meant to be
[938.48 → 939.70] when God said
[939.70 → 942.02] you are the body of Christ.
[943.62 → 944.76] It shouldn't be,
[944.88 → 945.84] at least our church
[945.84 → 947.16] shouldn't be so divided.
[947.88 → 948.78] But it is.
[950.64 → 951.50] Now you could say,
[951.60 → 952.28] okay, that's just,
[952.42 → 953.54] okay, you're talking internally.
[953.66 → 954.22] You're talking about
[954.22 → 955.04] our faith journeys.
[955.16 → 955.66] You're talking about
[955.66 → 956.10] our churches.
[956.40 → 957.22] What about the rest
[957.22 → 957.70] of the world?
[958.40 → 959.38] How is sin
[959.38 → 961.32] affecting our world
[961.32 → 962.92] in our societies,
[963.32 → 964.26] in our governments,
[964.26 → 965.26] in our schools,
[965.44 → 966.18] with our friends,
[966.28 → 966.90] our families,
[966.90 → 968.24] who do not maybe
[968.24 → 969.20] hold to this same
[969.20 → 969.74] Christian view?
[969.98 → 970.58] They don't know
[970.58 → 972.04] what sin is.
[972.62 → 973.70] They might not agree
[973.70 → 974.80] what sin is.
[975.30 → 976.08] How is it?
[976.42 → 977.16] What do you see?
[978.08 → 979.20] Do you see everyone
[979.20 → 980.50] doing a fantastic job
[980.50 → 981.60] of hitting that mark,
[982.10 → 982.72] that goal,
[982.80 → 983.50] if we can at least
[983.50 → 984.20] agree on that,
[984.34 → 985.38] that we want to love
[985.38 → 985.90] one another?
[986.90 → 987.88] When was the last time?
[987.96 → 989.02] Well, I don't want
[989.02 → 989.88] to say that specifically,
[990.02 → 991.22] but do you see,
[991.34 → 992.02] generally speaking,
[992.02 → 993.34] do you see love
[993.34 → 994.04] around you?
[995.30 → 995.68] Meaning,
[996.00 → 997.34] do you see people
[997.34 → 998.36] being selfless,
[998.68 → 999.12] patient,
[999.52 → 999.96] gentle,
[1000.36 → 1000.94] sacrificial,
[1001.36 → 1001.74] humble,
[1002.10 → 1002.74] and kind
[1002.74 → 1003.60] to all those
[1003.60 → 1004.18] around them?
[1005.78 → 1006.30] Sure,
[1006.44 → 1007.34] I see them all the time.
[1007.56 → 1008.20] If you do,
[1008.40 → 1008.96] good for you.
[1009.82 → 1010.40] We're trying,
[1010.52 → 1010.76] yes.
[1011.86 → 1012.82] But I'll try
[1012.82 → 1014.00] to hit reality for you.
[1014.40 → 1015.48] Go down and drive
[1015.48 → 1016.28] on East Hastings
[1016.28 → 1016.88] in Vancouver.
[1017.86 → 1018.68] Do you see
[1018.68 → 1019.54] the mark hit there?
[1019.98 → 1020.38] Do you see
[1020.38 → 1021.26] the kingdom of God
[1021.26 → 1022.18] in East Hastings?
[1023.84 → 1025.10] Or do you say
[1025.10 → 1025.68] to yourself,
[1026.08 → 1027.26] it's not supposed
[1027.26 → 1028.00] to be this way.
[1029.10 → 1030.18] It doesn't have
[1030.18 → 1030.98] to be like this.
[1033.22 → 1034.40] And a couple of days ago,
[1034.48 → 1035.22] we had a refugee
[1035.22 → 1035.84] fundraiser,
[1036.16 → 1036.80] and we're trying
[1036.80 → 1037.32] our best.
[1037.58 → 1038.32] We come together.
[1039.00 → 1040.48] Such generous people
[1040.48 → 1041.32] here we have,
[1041.72 → 1042.18] here at Hope,
[1042.46 → 1043.60] trying our best
[1043.60 → 1044.14] to represent
[1044.14 → 1044.82] his kingdom
[1044.82 → 1046.06] as we try to sponsor
[1046.06 → 1047.00] our refugee family.
[1047.22 → 1048.46] But at the same time,
[1048.68 → 1049.62] we got to witness
[1049.62 → 1050.24] through videos
[1050.24 → 1050.86] and pictures,
[1051.22 → 1051.80] the real,
[1051.98 → 1053.32] the real life
[1053.32 → 1054.24] suffering
[1054.24 → 1055.08] and the mourning
[1055.08 → 1055.78] and the pain
[1055.78 → 1057.12] that some of our refugees
[1057.12 → 1058.06] have to go through.
[1058.74 → 1059.78] You look at that
[1059.78 → 1060.28] and you go,
[1061.20 → 1062.72] we've done a great job
[1062.72 → 1063.60] of hitting that mark.
[1063.82 → 1064.84] We're pretty close.
[1064.90 → 1065.52] We're getting there.
[1067.04 → 1067.70] Or again,
[1067.76 → 1068.22] do you say,
[1068.46 → 1069.88] it doesn't have
[1069.88 → 1070.64] to be that way.
[1070.72 → 1071.42] It shouldn't
[1071.42 → 1072.28] be that way.
[1072.28 → 1075.52] Just to use
[1075.52 → 1076.24] some practical,
[1076.48 → 1077.28] relevant examples
[1077.28 → 1078.42] that even Daryl Johnson,
[1078.92 → 1080.74] who lives in Vancouver,
[1082.28 → 1083.56] he challenges us
[1083.56 → 1084.82] with some deeper questions.
[1084.94 → 1085.38] He says,
[1085.62 → 1086.12] he asks,
[1086.64 → 1087.24] does the world
[1087.24 → 1087.92] have to spend
[1087.92 → 1089.18] trillions of dollars
[1089.18 → 1089.58] a year
[1089.58 → 1090.50] to build weapons,
[1091.10 → 1092.10] which is ridiculously
[1092.10 → 1093.42] more than we spend
[1093.42 → 1094.06] on health,
[1094.44 → 1094.86] education,
[1094.98 → 1095.84] and social services
[1095.84 → 1096.46] combined?
[1096.46 → 1100.08] Does the pornography
[1100.08 → 1101.22] and prostitution
[1101.22 → 1102.22] have to be a source
[1102.22 → 1103.44] of grossly large
[1103.44 → 1104.32] sums of income?
[1106.82 → 1108.14] Do we have to still
[1108.14 → 1109.18] continue promoting
[1109.18 → 1110.28] this thing called
[1110.28 → 1111.58] anti-racism?
[1114.26 → 1115.10] Now, I mean,
[1115.26 → 1116.10] can't we just get rid
[1116.10 → 1116.90] of all of our prejudice
[1116.90 → 1117.98] and our suspicions?
[1119.80 → 1120.62] Can I not,
[1120.70 → 1121.22] to make it a little
[1121.22 → 1121.72] more personal,
[1121.84 → 1122.70] can I not change
[1122.70 → 1123.90] my own driving habits
[1123.90 → 1125.40] and not get mad
[1125.40 → 1126.26] at every other driver
[1126.26 → 1127.18] that cuts me off?
[1129.70 → 1131.04] Even playing soccer,
[1132.20 → 1133.08] even playing soccer,
[1133.18 → 1133.94] sorry, I turned away,
[1134.12 → 1134.66] sorry, Luke.
[1135.12 → 1136.38] Even playing soccer,
[1137.02 → 1137.82] I'll turn this way,
[1138.00 → 1138.78] even playing soccer
[1138.78 → 1140.44] in our church league
[1140.44 → 1142.24] against fellow brothers
[1142.24 → 1143.54] and sisters of Christ,
[1144.38 → 1146.36] why is it so difficult
[1146.36 → 1149.94] to not have hateful judgments,
[1150.46 → 1151.48] whether it be internally
[1151.48 → 1154.54] or externally, vocally?
[1156.26 → 1159.28] And why is there so much
[1159.28 → 1161.64] brokenness in our relationships
[1161.64 → 1164.46] with people who we call friends,
[1164.98 → 1165.56] our neighbours,
[1166.16 → 1167.32] and within our families?
[1169.40 → 1171.02] Why can we not get along
[1171.02 → 1172.68] and stay in healthy marriages?
[1172.68 → 1176.28] Why can we not reflect
[1176.28 → 1177.26] a loving unity
[1177.26 → 1178.08] in our families
[1178.08 → 1179.16] and in our homes?
[1181.22 → 1182.36] Is there sin?
[1183.96 → 1185.08] I would suggest,
[1185.18 → 1185.92] the Bible suggests,
[1186.00 → 1186.46] there is.
[1187.94 → 1189.64] If any of these examples
[1189.64 → 1190.66] are relatable to you,
[1190.70 → 1191.66] directly or indirectly,
[1192.10 → 1193.60] then maybe Paul's confession
[1193.60 → 1195.04] may ring true
[1195.04 → 1196.02] in your hearts as well.
[1196.02 → 1197.12] As Paul says
[1197.12 → 1198.16] in his letter to the Romans,
[1198.16 → 1199.20] as it is,
[1199.76 → 1200.70] it is no longer
[1200.70 → 1202.04] I myself who do it,
[1202.10 → 1204.74] but it is sin living in me.
[1205.00 → 1206.58] For I know that good itself
[1206.58 → 1207.80] does not dwell in me,
[1207.86 → 1208.28] that is,
[1208.52 → 1209.86] in my sinful nature.
[1210.64 → 1211.96] For I have the desire
[1211.96 → 1213.10] to do what is good,
[1213.26 → 1215.12] but I cannot carry it out.
[1216.20 → 1218.42] For I do not do the good,
[1218.58 → 1220.08] the good true blessing
[1220.08 → 1221.90] to be in sync with God,
[1222.58 → 1224.68] to represent His kingdom on earth
[1224.68 → 1226.56] like it is in heaven.
[1226.56 → 1227.44] The good,
[1227.66 → 1228.26] this good,
[1228.34 → 1229.36] I want to do,
[1229.60 → 1231.04] but I cannot carry it out.
[1231.24 → 1232.00] But the evil
[1232.00 → 1233.82] that I do not want to do,
[1234.22 → 1235.84] this I keep on doing.
[1239.86 → 1241.24] Sin is real.
[1243.06 → 1245.40] Is the world broken with sin?
[1246.68 → 1248.98] Am I broken with sin?
[1252.40 → 1253.48] And ultimately,
[1254.10 → 1255.90] there is something called death
[1255.90 → 1257.20] that no one can avoid.
[1257.84 → 1258.98] And this is the ultimate,
[1259.52 → 1261.04] final enemy that Paul says,
[1261.38 → 1262.18] because of sin.
[1264.72 → 1266.42] Death was not
[1266.42 → 1268.28] and is not supposed to be
[1268.28 → 1269.76] part of God's good creation,
[1269.98 → 1270.74] but it is,
[1270.94 → 1272.32] and we face it all the time.
[1273.62 → 1274.76] Whether it be the death
[1274.76 → 1276.12] of someone who is more elderly,
[1276.66 → 1277.32] and we judge,
[1277.74 → 1279.10] it's good for them to die now,
[1279.48 → 1280.42] it's good for you to go.
[1281.00 → 1283.04] Or it's an untimely death
[1283.04 → 1283.96] through an accident
[1283.96 → 1284.80] or a tragedy.
[1285.80 → 1286.84] Or it's the death
[1286.84 → 1287.74] of a child.
[1290.02 → 1291.04] Or a newborn.
[1292.76 → 1293.98] Whatever it may be,
[1294.18 → 1295.56] death is not
[1295.56 → 1296.68] and was not
[1296.68 → 1298.00] supposed to be
[1298.00 → 1299.48] part of God's creation.
[1301.36 → 1302.94] And God mourns
[1302.94 → 1303.80] because of this.
[1305.54 → 1306.52] God mourns
[1306.52 → 1307.28] because of death.
[1307.64 → 1308.18] When Jesus,
[1308.48 → 1309.54] in the Gospels we read,
[1309.62 → 1310.50] when Jesus visits
[1310.50 → 1311.20] his old friend,
[1311.50 → 1312.44] and he's informed
[1312.44 → 1313.22] that Lazarus,
[1313.28 → 1313.66] his friend,
[1313.98 → 1314.58] has died.
[1314.82 → 1315.86] And they're very sure
[1315.86 → 1317.40] that he is dead.
[1318.78 → 1319.70] Jesus does not
[1319.70 → 1320.58] just stand up
[1320.58 → 1321.66] and gets all cheery
[1321.66 → 1322.16] and joyful
[1322.16 → 1323.14] because he knows
[1323.14 → 1323.80] that he can just
[1323.80 → 1325.24] snap his fingers like that
[1325.24 → 1326.04] and raise his friend
[1326.04 → 1327.04] Lazarus from dead.
[1327.20 → 1328.14] He knows that.
[1328.36 → 1329.30] He knows he has
[1329.30 → 1330.26] the power to do that.
[1330.40 → 1331.16] And he does
[1331.16 → 1332.36] end up doing that.
[1333.50 → 1334.50] But what is
[1334.50 → 1335.44] the first thing
[1335.44 → 1336.36] that Jesus does
[1336.36 → 1337.50] as he is informed
[1337.50 → 1338.62] about the loss
[1338.62 → 1340.20] of his own friend?
[1341.86 → 1342.96] He weeps.
[1344.28 → 1345.28] The Son of God,
[1345.52 → 1346.06] the creator
[1346.06 → 1347.68] of the entire universe,
[1348.10 → 1348.72] breaks down
[1348.72 → 1350.32] in uncontrollable tears
[1350.32 → 1351.72] even though he knows
[1351.72 → 1352.38] he can raise him
[1352.38 → 1353.16] back from the dead.
[1356.16 → 1357.56] And this same God
[1357.56 → 1358.34] came to us
[1358.34 → 1359.32] as a fellow man
[1359.32 → 1360.00] and tells us
[1360.00 → 1360.86] that we are blessed
[1360.86 → 1361.80] when we mourn
[1361.80 → 1362.30] with him,
[1362.62 → 1363.74] when we share
[1363.74 → 1364.82] in his heart.
[1364.82 → 1369.46] And as we share
[1369.46 → 1370.82] God's heart,
[1371.42 → 1372.40] as we taste
[1372.40 → 1374.00] the awfulness
[1374.00 → 1374.60] and tragic,
[1374.80 → 1375.68] devastating effects
[1375.68 → 1376.16] of sin
[1376.16 → 1377.86] and ultimately death
[1377.86 → 1378.88] that no one can avoid,
[1379.26 → 1381.52] we are given joy.
[1382.04 → 1382.76] Such an irony.
[1383.40 → 1384.44] We are given joy
[1384.44 → 1385.64] through the hope
[1385.64 → 1386.70] that we have in Jesus.
[1387.48 → 1388.40] God's Holy Spirit
[1388.40 → 1389.66] comforts us
[1389.66 → 1390.72] as he mourns
[1390.72 → 1391.20] with us
[1391.20 → 1392.32] and reminds us
[1392.32 → 1393.38] that we have hope
[1393.38 → 1393.84] in Jesus
[1393.84 → 1394.74] who defeated
[1394.74 → 1396.14] all sin and death
[1396.14 → 1397.40] that we are called
[1397.40 → 1398.00] and invited
[1398.00 → 1399.54] into an eternal kingdom
[1399.54 → 1401.48] where he dwells
[1401.48 → 1402.22] with us forever.
[1402.58 → 1403.32] Where there are
[1403.32 → 1404.10] no more tears,
[1404.26 → 1404.82] no death,
[1404.92 → 1405.46] no crying,
[1405.54 → 1406.08] no pain.
[1406.34 → 1407.06] He says there are
[1407.06 → 1408.52] no more mourning
[1408.52 → 1409.24] in this kingdom.
[1409.78 → 1411.26] We don't have to anymore.
[1413.86 → 1415.36] That is our calling.
[1415.90 → 1417.58] That is true blessing.
[1418.44 → 1419.38] Blessed are those
[1419.38 → 1420.20] who mourn,
[1420.26 → 1421.40] who share God's heart.
[1422.18 → 1422.80] And so what does
[1422.80 → 1423.72] that look like today?
[1424.62 → 1425.60] What does sharing
[1425.60 → 1426.60] God's heart like this
[1426.60 → 1427.28] look like
[1427.28 → 1429.12] for us in our lives
[1429.12 → 1429.46] today?
[1431.10 → 1432.26] And as I was wrestling
[1432.26 → 1432.68] with it,
[1432.82 → 1433.50] the first thing
[1433.50 → 1434.22] that came to mind
[1434.22 → 1436.16] was this serves
[1436.16 → 1437.18] as a wake-up call,
[1437.54 → 1438.48] a slap in the face
[1438.48 → 1438.96] if you will.
[1439.22 → 1439.68] It's saying,
[1439.92 → 1441.20] John, wake up.
[1441.94 → 1442.84] There is sin.
[1443.40 → 1444.66] There is brokenness
[1444.66 → 1445.18] all around.
[1445.48 → 1446.42] You don't have to look
[1446.42 → 1447.40] too far by the way.
[1447.78 → 1448.78] Just go look in a mirror.
[1450.42 → 1451.34] There is sin.
[1451.34 → 1452.22] We are broken.
[1453.22 → 1453.90] Mourn with me,
[1453.96 → 1454.52] God says.
[1457.60 → 1458.80] Since we know,
[1459.18 → 1460.48] since we know
[1460.48 → 1461.00] that the world
[1461.00 → 1461.52] is broken,
[1461.60 → 1462.56] that we are broken,
[1462.94 → 1464.12] we can mourn
[1464.12 → 1464.90] with God.
[1465.46 → 1466.66] And now turn that around,
[1466.90 → 1467.82] we can mourn
[1467.82 → 1468.60] with one another.
[1470.78 → 1471.86] We can share
[1471.86 → 1472.58] the burden
[1472.58 → 1473.50] of mourning
[1473.50 → 1474.78] for this world
[1474.78 → 1475.64] and for ourselves
[1475.64 → 1476.70] because I think
[1476.70 → 1477.14] that's how
[1477.14 → 1478.42] God's spirit works.
[1479.94 → 1480.92] God provides us
[1480.92 → 1481.42] with people
[1481.42 → 1482.16] who can relate
[1482.16 → 1483.54] and sympathize,
[1483.86 → 1484.88] share this heart
[1484.88 → 1485.70] together.
[1486.22 → 1487.16] We don't do it alone.
[1487.92 → 1488.28] Christianity
[1488.28 → 1489.34] is not a faith
[1489.34 → 1490.10] done alone.
[1491.06 → 1491.78] It is a faith
[1491.78 → 1492.70] done together.
[1493.04 → 1493.90] God calls us
[1493.90 → 1494.92] as his people,
[1495.14 → 1496.40] not just as a person.
[1498.30 → 1498.76] And so from
[1498.76 → 1499.44] the book of Hebrews,
[1499.64 → 1500.74] we read this description
[1500.74 → 1501.24] of Jesus
[1501.24 → 1502.14] and we are called
[1502.14 → 1502.96] to his likeness.
[1502.96 → 1504.74] For we do not have
[1504.74 → 1505.48] a high priest,
[1505.70 → 1505.96] Jesus,
[1506.20 → 1507.18] who is unable
[1507.18 → 1508.12] to empathize
[1508.12 → 1508.84] with our weaknesses,
[1509.34 → 1510.52] but we have one
[1510.52 → 1511.28] who has been tempted
[1511.28 → 1512.16] in every way
[1512.16 → 1513.58] just as we are,
[1513.88 → 1515.44] yet he did not sin.
[1516.66 → 1517.82] This is the encouragement
[1517.82 → 1518.14] then.
[1518.40 → 1519.80] Let us then approach
[1519.80 → 1521.02] God's throne of grace
[1521.02 → 1522.02] with confidence,
[1522.46 → 1523.14] with joy,
[1523.44 → 1524.74] so that we may receive
[1524.74 → 1526.48] mercy and find grace
[1526.48 → 1527.56] to help us
[1527.56 → 1528.70] in our time of need.
[1528.70 → 1533.74] That is our calling.
[1535.68 → 1536.46] And so the question
[1536.46 → 1536.94] to you,
[1537.34 → 1538.18] question for us,
[1538.64 → 1539.56] who do you mourn
[1539.56 → 1540.10] with hope?
[1541.36 → 1542.48] Who is it that you
[1542.48 → 1543.54] share this burden with?
[1544.56 → 1545.66] As you yourself
[1545.66 → 1546.80] mourn for the brokenness
[1546.80 → 1547.26] that is,
[1547.54 → 1548.84] who do you reach out to
[1548.84 → 1549.90] in your time of need?
[1551.70 → 1552.58] And then again,
[1552.70 → 1553.32] turn it around.
[1553.94 → 1555.20] Who is it that you
[1555.20 → 1556.32] can witness to
[1556.32 → 1557.50] to this blessing?
[1557.50 → 1559.82] That there is comfort
[1559.82 → 1560.94] in this gospel story,
[1561.02 → 1561.58] in our faith.
[1562.00 → 1562.96] God provides us
[1562.96 → 1563.72] with comfort.
[1564.18 → 1565.08] Who is it that you
[1565.08 → 1565.72] can witness
[1565.72 → 1566.98] to that comfort to?
[1569.28 → 1570.50] Who can you approach
[1570.50 → 1571.68] God's throne of grace
[1571.68 → 1572.06] with?
[1574.02 → 1574.38] And so,
[1574.48 → 1575.50] blessed people of hope,
[1576.12 → 1577.04] mourn with God.
[1577.62 → 1578.52] Mourn with one another.
[1579.06 → 1580.40] Mourn with a broken world.
[1580.90 → 1581.62] There is so much
[1581.62 → 1582.34] loving power
[1582.34 → 1583.38] in grieving together.
[1584.38 → 1585.34] Now you may not know,
[1585.42 → 1586.28] if you're anything like me,
[1586.28 → 1587.06] you may not know
[1587.06 → 1587.76] what to say
[1587.76 → 1589.02] or how to exactly
[1589.02 → 1590.16] comfort other people
[1590.16 → 1590.80] who are in mourning.
[1592.72 → 1593.78] But being there
[1593.78 → 1595.66] and reflecting God's presence
[1595.66 → 1596.70] for those who are
[1596.70 → 1597.26] in mourning
[1597.26 → 1598.82] is a beautiful reflection
[1598.82 → 1599.66] of His kingdom.
[1600.14 → 1600.98] Just be there.
[1603.06 → 1604.14] Because ultimately,
[1604.60 → 1605.32] our comfort
[1605.32 → 1606.36] leads us
[1606.36 → 1607.10] to an ending
[1607.10 → 1607.96] that does not
[1607.96 → 1609.10] end with mourning.
[1609.56 → 1610.60] This gospel story
[1610.60 → 1612.28] leads us to the hope
[1612.28 → 1613.04] we have in Jesus.
[1613.04 → 1614.56] And so,
[1614.70 → 1615.26] people of hope,
[1615.36 → 1616.02] you are blessed
[1616.02 → 1617.08] to be a blessing.
[1617.70 → 1618.32] You are blessed
[1618.32 → 1619.04] to mourn
[1619.04 → 1620.48] so that you may
[1620.48 → 1621.30] mourn with others
[1621.30 → 1622.20] and lead them
[1622.20 → 1622.76] to the comfort
[1622.76 → 1624.10] that can only come
[1624.10 → 1624.90] from the hope
[1624.90 → 1626.14] we have in Christ.
[1627.02 → 1628.26] May that be a blessing
[1628.26 → 1628.92] for all of us
[1628.92 → 1629.34] this morning.
[1629.86 → 1630.36] Let's pray.
[1630.36 → 1630.40] Let's pray.
[1630.40 → 1631.40] Let's pray.
[1631.40 → 1632.40] Let's pray.
[1638.72 → 1639.94] Loving Father,
[1640.94 → 1643.32] we come before You
[1643.32 → 1646.16] and we put
[1646.16 → 1647.68] and we want to bring
[1647.68 → 1650.32] all of our struggles,
[1650.98 → 1652.28] all of our sin
[1652.28 → 1653.76] before You
[1653.76 → 1655.26] because we know
[1655.26 → 1657.38] that You have defeated sin,
[1658.02 → 1659.22] You have defeated death,
[1659.22 → 1661.00] that we are promised
[1661.00 → 1662.00] victory in Your name.
[1664.02 → 1664.44] But Lord,
[1664.52 → 1665.28] we also know
[1665.28 → 1666.48] that there is still mourning.
[1667.06 → 1667.80] There is pain
[1667.80 → 1668.54] here and now.
[1670.14 → 1670.98] I pray
[1670.98 → 1672.54] for a blessing
[1672.54 → 1674.08] of peace
[1674.08 → 1675.00] that only You
[1675.00 → 1675.56] can allow.
[1676.80 → 1677.34] The peace
[1677.34 → 1677.84] that comes
[1677.84 → 1679.02] by Your Holy Spirit
[1679.02 → 1680.00] as You,
[1680.08 → 1680.56] Yourself,
[1680.74 → 1681.48] mourn with us.
[1682.68 → 1683.52] We thank You
[1683.52 → 1684.24] that You're a God
[1684.24 → 1685.18] who is not distant
[1685.18 → 1685.70] from us,
[1686.32 → 1687.14] that You're a God
[1687.14 → 1687.68] who comes
[1687.68 → 1689.10] wherever we are.
[1689.94 → 1690.54] And You're here
[1690.54 → 1691.40] with us
[1691.40 → 1693.08] and You mourn with us
[1693.08 → 1694.02] and You comfort us.
[1694.72 → 1695.44] May we be
[1695.44 → 1696.36] this same comfort
[1696.36 → 1697.50] to the world
[1697.50 → 1698.62] that is broken in sin.
[1699.76 → 1700.88] We ask all this
[1700.88 → 1701.42] in Your name.
[1702.06 → 1702.32] Amen.
[1704.66 → 1705.90] I invite you to stand
[1705.90 → 1706.52] as we sing
[1706.52 → 1707.58] our song of response.
