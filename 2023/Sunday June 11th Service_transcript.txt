[0.00 --> 5.42]  Good morning, beloved church.
[7.20 --> 10.14]  So good to see the second service crowd here.
[10.26 --> 11.86]  Some of you I recognize.
[12.24 --> 15.28]  You've been a part of my past life here in Cloverdale,
[15.38 --> 17.16]  and it's so nice to be among friends.
[18.16 --> 20.02]  Thank you, Kennedy, for reading that.
[20.56 --> 22.46]  It's really well done.
[23.64 --> 25.62]  The parable of the prodigal son.
[26.48 --> 29.70]  This is perhaps the favorite.
[30.00 --> 32.32]  Parable of all parables.
[33.22 --> 36.64]  Probably most of us have heard many sermons on this.
[36.76 --> 37.20]  I have.
[38.16 --> 40.68]  Our parable begins with the words of Jesus,
[40.92 --> 43.64]  there was a man who had two sons.
[45.20 --> 46.98]  And whenever you begin that way,
[47.12 --> 48.88]  you don't need to read another thing.
[48.88 --> 51.52]  You know that there's going to be tension in the story.
[52.66 --> 53.84]  There's going to be drama.
[55.10 --> 57.46]  If you have a father, he has two sons,
[57.46 --> 60.92]  or you have a mother with two sons or two daughters,
[61.28 --> 62.98]  you've got tension.
[63.14 --> 66.78]  And we don't need sociology to tell us this or psychology.
[66.78 --> 71.44]  We just look through the lens of our own dysfunctional family,
[71.44 --> 72.36]  and we go,
[72.84 --> 75.00]  this is going to be an exciting story.
[75.00 --> 77.32]  In fact, in Genesis 1,
[77.42 --> 81.52]  the whole Bible begins with the story of a father and mother with two sons.
[82.32 --> 82.88]  Cain and Abel.
[83.84 --> 84.24]  Drama.
[85.04 --> 86.22]  And then Jacob and Esau.
[86.86 --> 88.32]  And then Absalom and Amnon.
[88.32 --> 89.76]  And then James and John.
[89.90 --> 90.88]  And Mary and Martha.
[91.06 --> 91.90]  And so it goes.
[91.90 --> 94.54]  And there's drama in every story
[94.54 --> 97.80]  because one sibling is always older,
[98.20 --> 100.60]  and that makes the other one younger.
[102.38 --> 103.96]  And we like to be older.
[104.72 --> 106.20]  We don't like to be younger.
[106.68 --> 107.92]  Even if you're twins,
[108.20 --> 110.12]  one comes out of the womb first,
[110.22 --> 111.58]  and therein lies the difficulty.
[111.74 --> 113.16]  It's in that word, first.
[113.72 --> 116.12]  We generally don't like to be second.
[117.44 --> 120.34]  Second chair, second fiddle, second string.
[120.34 --> 122.78]  Congratulations, you've come in second place.
[124.06 --> 126.78]  And even if dad loves both boys equally,
[127.04 --> 128.34]  which I'm sure he does,
[128.52 --> 131.50]  I am one of two brothers,
[131.76 --> 134.32]  and I'm a father with two sons,
[134.52 --> 138.72]  and I'd like to think I love both Grady and Charlie the same,
[139.46 --> 142.40]  the older brother will always remind the younger brother
[142.40 --> 144.18]  that dad loved me longer.
[145.84 --> 146.84]  It's true.
[146.84 --> 151.38]  I've got more history with my dad than my brother.
[152.50 --> 155.80]  And so the younger or the older son or the older daughter
[155.80 --> 159.32]  will tend to struggle with a sense of entitlement,
[159.84 --> 163.56]  especially after the younger little brat comes along.
[164.72 --> 168.72]  And if the younger sibling happens to be the kind of sibling
[168.72 --> 173.26]  that wants to be as unlike the older sibling as possible,
[173.26 --> 175.80]  you've got yourself a story.
[176.54 --> 179.02]  So I envision the older brother in the story,
[179.12 --> 180.68]  if we were telling the story today,
[181.10 --> 183.24]  he would work on one of the high rises
[183.24 --> 187.20]  in the corner of Berard and Georgia,
[187.20 --> 189.70]  and he would be wearing a suit from Harry Rosen's.
[189.70 --> 193.66]  He'd have a button-down shirt in his spare time.
[193.76 --> 195.62]  He would listen to Kenny G.
[195.62 --> 201.22]  And the younger brother wears black leather and chains
[201.22 --> 202.88]  and is highly tattooed,
[202.94 --> 204.50]  and he listens to the Rolling Stones.
[205.00 --> 209.34]  And it is his goal to be as unlike his older brother as possible.
[210.32 --> 211.20]  But here's the deal.
[211.78 --> 215.26]  It doesn't matter the age of the brothers or the style.
[215.26 --> 218.38]  Both boys desperately need their father,
[218.60 --> 220.00]  and they also need one another,
[220.22 --> 222.22]  and neither of them can see it.
[222.28 --> 224.72]  And herein lies the theme of this famous parable.
[225.56 --> 230.58]  Both sons are seeking their identity independently of their father.
[231.68 --> 234.56]  The younger son, doubting his belovedness,
[234.92 --> 238.56]  wants to find himself with money and what money can buy
[238.56 --> 240.80]  and the freedom that money will give him.
[241.36 --> 244.86]  With his inheritance, he can finally leave the constraints of the farm.
[244.86 --> 248.08]  He can leave living under the shadow of his older brother.
[248.26 --> 248.92]  He can be free.
[249.38 --> 250.28]  He can go to Vegas.
[250.84 --> 253.46]  And he can spend his money the way he wants.
[254.30 --> 258.30]  But the older son, also doubting his belovedness,
[258.94 --> 262.36]  has created for himself a life of responsibility.
[263.68 --> 265.50]  And there's nothing wrong with that.
[265.78 --> 268.90]  But along with the older brother's responsibility
[268.90 --> 273.26]  is a deep-seated resentment against anybody
[273.26 --> 276.20]  who is not as responsible as he is.
[276.74 --> 280.62]  And so we see that it's the good boys
[280.62 --> 285.12]  who usually feel like they deserve more.
[286.28 --> 288.84]  The story begins not with the older brother,
[288.96 --> 290.98]  but with the younger requesting his inheritance
[290.98 --> 294.24]  and blowing the whole thing in Gentile territory,
[294.24 --> 297.08]  which would have been a very shameful thing for a Jew to do.
[297.08 --> 301.18]  We sometimes think that when the younger son
[301.18 --> 302.80]  maybe went to his father and said,
[302.92 --> 304.44]  Dad, I know this is going to break your heart
[304.44 --> 305.82]  and I know that you haven't died,
[306.02 --> 307.92]  but I want one-third of my inheritance
[307.92 --> 310.04]  or one-third of the estate right now.
[310.36 --> 314.30]  We picture maybe the father bursting into tears saying,
[314.46 --> 315.90]  Son, this does break my heart,
[315.98 --> 318.80]  but here, and he writes him a check and gives it to him
[318.80 --> 319.84]  and says bye-bye.
[320.12 --> 321.40]  It wouldn't have happened that way.
[321.40 --> 325.36]  In fact, the father would not have given him a bag of gold
[325.36 --> 327.90]  and said, here, be careful with this money.
[328.56 --> 330.20]  Not in first-century Palestine.
[331.12 --> 332.94]  The father and the older brother
[332.94 --> 336.02]  would have had a massive liquidation sale
[336.02 --> 339.04]  where they sold pennies on the dollar,
[339.50 --> 343.46]  vast amounts of real estate and buildings and equipment
[343.46 --> 348.04]  in order to give the young son his share of the estate.
[348.04 --> 352.56]  The entire community would have known about the liquidation sale
[352.56 --> 354.08]  because people in the village
[354.08 --> 357.30]  would have been buying this cheap property.
[358.10 --> 360.84]  And so the father and the older brother
[360.84 --> 365.40]  have been deeply humiliated in this whole ordeal.
[365.96 --> 368.56]  Well, we know the story when the party was over
[368.56 --> 369.66]  and the money was gone
[369.66 --> 372.96]  and the market turned from a bull market to a bear market,
[373.34 --> 375.92]  the young prodigal realized that the pigs,
[375.92 --> 379.16]  owned by the Gentile pig farmer,
[379.56 --> 382.32]  and there's meant to be some comedic irony here,
[382.84 --> 386.64]  they had it better off than he did.
[386.76 --> 389.72]  And so he developed a plan to save himself.
[390.66 --> 392.04]  He got into this mess,
[392.74 --> 395.16]  he would now have to get himself out.
[395.84 --> 399.74]  This is always the thinking of salvation by works.
[400.42 --> 404.30]  Now, would it be humiliating for the younger son to go home?
[404.30 --> 405.96]  Yes, and he knows that.
[406.38 --> 409.00]  Would he be willing to face the village gauntlet?
[409.48 --> 409.86]  Yes.
[410.12 --> 412.96]  Would he be willing to face the scorn of the older brother?
[413.20 --> 413.58]  Yes.
[414.02 --> 417.00]  If going home simply meant that he could learn a trade,
[417.30 --> 419.40]  get a job, and avoid starvation,
[419.66 --> 422.84]  he was willing to eat whatever humble pie was necessary.
[423.84 --> 428.44]  And so he crafts a very clever repentance speech.
[428.76 --> 430.06]  But we shouldn't be fooled.
[430.06 --> 434.30]  Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you.
[434.78 --> 437.10]  I'm no longer worthy to be called your son.
[437.58 --> 440.78]  Make me like one of your hired men.
[441.86 --> 444.84]  This was his self-saving plan.
[445.78 --> 449.20]  The idea of restored sonship with his father,
[449.60 --> 451.00]  not even on his radar.
[451.78 --> 455.24]  That ship had sailed, according to the younger son.
[455.24 --> 460.26]  The idea of redemption, forgiveness, actual reconciliation,
[460.92 --> 462.32]  not even a chance.
[462.66 --> 465.84]  He was willing to simply work for hire.
[466.80 --> 470.18]  But of course, what the younger prodigal didn't realize
[470.18 --> 474.26]  was the depths of his father's compassion for him
[474.26 --> 477.44]  and his father's ability
[477.44 --> 482.70]  to make a horrible wrong in the family right.
[482.70 --> 485.94]  Now, I don't remember where I read this from.
[486.04 --> 487.46]  It could have been Tim Keller's book,
[487.54 --> 488.50]  The Prodigal God.
[488.66 --> 491.14]  But one of the authors that I read
[491.14 --> 492.66]  in preparation for this message
[492.66 --> 494.78]  said that the Muslims
[494.78 --> 497.20]  used the story of the prodigal son
[497.20 --> 498.58]  to show Christians
[498.58 --> 502.28]  that salvation doesn't require a mediator
[502.28 --> 503.36]  or a savior.
[504.22 --> 505.12]  They say,
[505.54 --> 508.12]  look, the young rebel came to his senses
[508.12 --> 510.64]  and came home on his own steam
[510.64 --> 513.00]  and the father simply met him.
[513.36 --> 514.32]  There's no cross,
[514.54 --> 515.40]  no atonement,
[515.70 --> 516.66]  there's no Jesus,
[517.18 --> 518.46]  and they're reconciled.
[519.30 --> 519.76]  He says,
[519.84 --> 521.78]  that's what the Islam faith is like,
[522.14 --> 523.08]  but you Christians,
[523.72 --> 525.98]  you need a mediator.
[527.64 --> 528.70]  Are they right?
[530.38 --> 532.76]  As the prodigal returns home,
[532.94 --> 533.36]  remember,
[533.66 --> 536.28]  he expects his father to be a certain way.
[536.28 --> 538.44]  He expects him to be aloof
[538.44 --> 539.10]  and cold
[539.10 --> 540.00]  and callous,
[540.58 --> 541.00]  angry.
[541.76 --> 542.80]  Once the word got out
[542.80 --> 543.98]  that the father's estate
[543.98 --> 546.72]  was squandered in Gentile territory,
[547.42 --> 548.64]  he would have been blacklisted
[548.64 --> 549.94]  by the entire community
[549.94 --> 551.82]  and subjected to what was called
[551.82 --> 553.78]  the Kazaza ceremony.
[554.24 --> 556.40]  This really was like cancel culture
[556.40 --> 558.94]  in first century Palestine or Israel.
[559.50 --> 560.08]  Kenneth Bailey,
[560.20 --> 561.22]  who spent his whole life
[561.22 --> 562.36]  ministering to people
[562.36 --> 563.38]  in the Middle East,
[563.62 --> 564.16]  said this,
[564.16 --> 565.72]  Upon returning home,
[566.42 --> 567.46]  the son would be obliged
[567.46 --> 568.76]  to sit for some time
[568.76 --> 569.92]  outside the city gate
[569.92 --> 570.80]  of the family home
[570.80 --> 572.52]  before even being allowed
[572.52 --> 573.76]  to see his father.
[574.26 --> 575.64]  After sufficient time,
[575.92 --> 577.18]  he would be summoned in
[577.18 --> 579.46]  with the boy already rejected
[579.46 --> 581.10]  by the entire village.
[581.42 --> 582.60]  The father would express
[582.60 --> 583.76]  his deep anger
[583.76 --> 585.40]  and the boy would be obliged
[585.40 --> 586.20]  to apologize
[586.20 --> 588.16]  for everything he had done
[588.16 --> 590.68]  and then plead for job training
[590.68 --> 591.80]  in the next village.
[592.46 --> 593.08]  End of quote.
[593.08 --> 595.08]  Then what they would do
[595.08 --> 596.24]  is the townspeople
[596.24 --> 598.72]  would take a large clay pot
[598.72 --> 600.30]  and they would stand
[600.30 --> 602.20]  before the son
[602.20 --> 603.18]  who had come home
[603.18 --> 605.22]  and they would smash the pot
[605.22 --> 606.08]  in front of him
[606.08 --> 608.14]  indicating that any chance
[608.14 --> 609.60]  of future reconciliation
[609.60 --> 610.58]  was over.
[611.60 --> 613.54]  Any shalom the family had
[613.54 --> 614.28]  had been broken.
[614.92 --> 616.24]  There was no chance
[616.24 --> 617.40]  that the broken pieces
[617.40 --> 618.20]  of that pot
[618.20 --> 619.28]  could ever be put
[619.28 --> 620.30]  back together again.
[622.04 --> 624.96]  This was cancel culture
[624.96 --> 626.74]  like we've never seen it before.
[627.50 --> 629.44]  But this is not what happens
[629.44 --> 630.54]  in the story, is it?
[631.84 --> 634.16]  Seeing his son from a distance
[634.16 --> 636.02]  and not knowing anything
[636.02 --> 637.86]  about his heart condition,
[638.34 --> 639.50]  the father breaks
[639.50 --> 640.74]  with oriental tradition
[640.74 --> 642.02]  and runs
[642.02 --> 642.86]  to meet his son.
[643.74 --> 644.34]  The father
[644.34 --> 645.22]  runs.
[645.92 --> 646.48]  In fact,
[646.76 --> 647.20]  the Greek
[647.20 --> 648.22]  indicates
[648.22 --> 648.84]  that he
[648.84 --> 649.64]  raced
[649.64 --> 650.74]  towards his son.
[651.12 --> 651.74]  He ran
[651.74 --> 652.56]  as if he was
[652.56 --> 653.02]  running
[653.02 --> 653.66]  against
[653.66 --> 654.90]  somebody else.
[654.90 --> 655.70]  Who was he
[655.70 --> 656.60]  running against?
[657.60 --> 658.74]  Why did he want
[658.74 --> 659.68]  to get to his son
[659.68 --> 660.48]  so fast?
[660.94 --> 662.10]  The whole experience
[662.10 --> 662.58]  would have been
[662.58 --> 663.52]  very undignified
[663.52 --> 664.30]  and humiliating
[664.30 --> 664.98]  for an elderly
[664.98 --> 665.78]  Jewish man.
[666.08 --> 666.74]  It would be safe
[666.74 --> 667.40]  to say that he
[667.40 --> 668.08]  hadn't run
[668.08 --> 668.82]  for years.
[669.42 --> 670.48]  He had no need
[670.48 --> 671.00]  to run.
[671.66 --> 672.70]  He would throw off
[672.70 --> 673.66]  his outer garment
[673.66 --> 674.52]  and then he would
[674.52 --> 675.28]  take his hands
[675.28 --> 676.00]  and pull up
[676.00 --> 677.28]  his undergarment,
[677.46 --> 678.94]  tie it around
[678.94 --> 680.12]  his waist,
[680.26 --> 681.70]  revealing his naked
[681.70 --> 683.36]  legs as he ran.
[683.44 --> 683.84]  It would have been
[683.84 --> 684.98]  a very shameful
[684.98 --> 686.50]  thing for a dignified
[686.50 --> 687.74]  elderly Jewish
[687.74 --> 689.16]  man to do.
[689.34 --> 690.12]  But this is
[690.12 --> 690.84]  exactly
[690.84 --> 692.42]  what he does.
[693.04 --> 694.30]  Why does the
[694.30 --> 695.84]  father run
[695.84 --> 697.14]  towards his son?
[697.14 --> 698.06]  Is it simply
[698.06 --> 699.18]  because he loves
[699.18 --> 699.86]  his son and he
[699.86 --> 700.64]  misses his son
[700.64 --> 701.28]  and he can hardly
[701.28 --> 701.92]  wait to get his
[701.92 --> 702.80]  arms around him?
[703.60 --> 704.00]  Maybe.
[705.84 --> 707.16]  Or maybe
[707.16 --> 708.18]  the father
[708.18 --> 709.90]  runs to his son
[709.90 --> 710.72]  knowing the
[710.72 --> 711.96]  disgrace that's
[711.96 --> 713.10]  awaiting him
[713.10 --> 714.38]  as he walks
[714.38 --> 715.22]  through the village
[715.22 --> 716.42]  and he wants
[716.42 --> 717.00]  to pronounce
[717.00 --> 718.12]  his verdict
[718.12 --> 719.40]  on his son
[719.40 --> 720.60]  before anybody
[720.60 --> 721.92]  else has a chance
[721.92 --> 723.18]  to shame him.
[724.96 --> 725.96]  And so moved
[725.96 --> 726.84]  with compassion,
[726.84 --> 727.46]  the father
[727.46 --> 728.32]  takes upon
[728.32 --> 729.16]  himself,
[729.72 --> 730.66]  the humiliation
[730.66 --> 731.60]  and disgrace
[731.60 --> 732.16]  that's due
[732.16 --> 732.74]  his son.
[733.22 --> 734.02]  It is a picture
[734.02 --> 734.80]  of God
[734.80 --> 735.62]  in Christ
[735.62 --> 737.64]  reconciling
[737.64 --> 738.22]  the world
[738.22 --> 739.46]  to himself
[739.46 --> 740.68]  at great cost.
[740.88 --> 741.52]  He doesn't
[741.52 --> 742.42]  wait for his
[742.42 --> 743.24]  son to get
[743.24 --> 743.84]  to him
[743.84 --> 744.86]  but at great
[744.86 --> 745.86]  cost to
[745.86 --> 746.46]  himself
[746.46 --> 747.84]  mercifully
[747.84 --> 749.08]  embraces him
[749.08 --> 750.58]  and the original
[750.58 --> 751.78]  language tells us
[751.78 --> 752.40]  that when he
[752.40 --> 753.48]  kisses his son
[753.48 --> 754.02]  it's in the
[754.02 --> 754.56]  continuous
[754.56 --> 755.60]  tense
[755.60 --> 756.78]  he kisses him
[756.78 --> 757.84]  over and
[757.84 --> 758.62]  over and
[758.62 --> 759.28]  over again.
[759.44 --> 760.42]  He smothers him
[760.42 --> 760.90]  with kisses
[760.90 --> 762.36]  and there in the
[762.36 --> 763.24]  arms of his
[763.24 --> 764.40]  father he is
[764.40 --> 765.12]  raised from the
[765.12 --> 765.36]  dead.
[765.36 --> 768.94]  and this act of
[768.94 --> 769.62]  compassionate
[769.62 --> 770.64]  humiliation
[770.64 --> 772.66]  was public.
[773.86 --> 774.50]  Think of the
[774.50 --> 775.04]  cross.
[775.64 --> 776.34]  God in
[776.34 --> 776.84]  Christ
[776.84 --> 778.78]  dying in
[778.78 --> 779.16]  front of
[779.16 --> 779.58]  people.
[780.42 --> 780.76]  There are
[780.76 --> 781.76]  villagers and
[781.76 --> 782.80]  servants close
[782.80 --> 783.96]  by watching this
[783.96 --> 784.96]  unusual scene
[784.96 --> 786.12]  of the father
[786.12 --> 786.96]  embracing the
[786.96 --> 787.74]  runaway son.
[787.74 --> 788.70]  We know that
[788.70 --> 789.16]  because the
[789.16 --> 789.78]  father turns
[789.78 --> 790.22]  to one of
[790.22 --> 790.42]  them and
[790.42 --> 790.74]  he says
[790.74 --> 791.52]  quickly go
[791.52 --> 793.58]  make haste
[793.58 --> 794.48]  get a robe
[794.48 --> 795.16]  and place it
[795.16 --> 795.46]  on his
[795.46 --> 795.82]  shoulders
[795.82 --> 797.42]  and go into
[797.42 --> 797.98]  my bedroom
[797.98 --> 798.58]  and get my
[798.58 --> 799.44]  signature ring
[799.44 --> 800.02]  and put the
[800.02 --> 800.56]  ring on my
[800.56 --> 801.28]  son's finger
[801.28 --> 802.02]  indicating that
[802.02 --> 802.70]  he belongs
[802.70 --> 803.24]  to us
[803.24 --> 805.08]  and put the
[805.08 --> 805.72]  sandals on
[805.72 --> 806.18]  his feet.
[806.36 --> 806.84]  I want my
[806.84 --> 807.44]  son to feel
[807.44 --> 807.84]  at home
[807.84 --> 808.32]  immediately
[808.32 --> 809.98]  and there
[809.98 --> 810.72]  will be no
[810.72 --> 811.84]  kazaza ceremony
[811.84 --> 812.62]  here tonight.
[812.90 --> 813.20]  No.
[813.42 --> 814.14]  No goat
[814.14 --> 814.56]  tonight.
[814.74 --> 815.20]  We're having
[815.20 --> 815.60]  beef.
[815.92 --> 816.62]  Kill the
[816.62 --> 817.26]  fattened
[817.26 --> 817.62]  calf.
[817.74 --> 818.46]  If we
[818.46 --> 819.64]  break anything
[819.64 --> 820.48]  in front of
[820.48 --> 821.24]  my son
[821.24 --> 821.98]  we are going
[821.98 --> 822.66]  to be breaking
[822.66 --> 823.46]  the bottle
[823.46 --> 824.08]  of champagne
[824.08 --> 824.64]  that we have
[824.64 --> 825.10]  been saving
[825.10 --> 825.62]  for a very
[825.62 --> 826.16]  long time
[826.16 --> 827.98]  for this
[827.98 --> 829.40]  momentous
[829.40 --> 830.02]  moment.
[831.46 --> 832.26]  Do you
[832.26 --> 832.68]  see the
[832.68 --> 833.22]  cross in
[833.22 --> 833.72]  the story?
[835.34 --> 835.98]  Yes.
[836.12 --> 836.60]  The public
[836.60 --> 837.30]  humiliation
[837.30 --> 837.68]  of the
[837.68 --> 838.06]  innocent.
[839.22 --> 839.98]  The righteous
[839.98 --> 841.08]  man suffering
[841.08 --> 841.72]  on behalf
[841.72 --> 842.02]  of the
[842.02 --> 842.66]  unrighteous.
[843.50 --> 844.48]  The judge
[844.48 --> 845.44]  bearing the
[845.44 --> 846.10]  shame of
[846.10 --> 846.42]  the
[846.42 --> 847.84]  offender.
[847.84 --> 849.62]  The robe
[849.62 --> 850.18]  of one
[850.18 --> 850.66]  man's
[850.66 --> 851.40]  righteousness
[851.40 --> 852.54]  being imputed
[852.54 --> 853.00]  to the
[853.00 --> 853.40]  naked
[853.40 --> 853.94]  sinful
[853.94 --> 854.52]  shoulders
[854.52 --> 855.38]  of the
[855.38 --> 855.64]  sinner.
[857.00 --> 857.70]  We see
[857.70 --> 858.32]  God
[858.32 --> 859.84]  in Christ
[859.84 --> 861.40]  reconciling
[861.40 --> 861.96]  the world
[861.96 --> 863.16]  to himself.
[863.16 --> 864.16]  God
[864.16 --> 864.22]  will
[864.22 --> 865.16]  be
[865.16 --> 865.68]  God
[865.68 --> 866.16]  to the
[866.16 --> 866.56]  son.
[866.56 --> 866.84]  God
[866.84 --> 867.16]  will be
[867.16 --> 867.32]  to the
[867.32 --> 867.34]  son.
[867.34 --> 868.06]  God
[868.06 --> 868.50]  will be
[868.50 --> 869.00]  to the
[869.00 --> 871.36]  son.
[871.70 --> 872.56]  You may have
[872.56 --> 873.10]  noticed that
[873.10 --> 873.76]  following the
[873.76 --> 875.10]  humiliating race
[875.10 --> 875.94]  and the embrace
[875.94 --> 876.54]  and the kissing
[876.54 --> 877.12]  and all of
[877.12 --> 877.40]  that,
[877.82 --> 878.14]  when the
[878.14 --> 878.82]  son finally
[878.82 --> 879.40]  has a chance
[879.40 --> 881.28]  to speak
[881.28 --> 881.78]  out his
[881.78 --> 882.68]  famous repentance
[882.68 --> 883.20]  speech,
[883.60 --> 884.22]  he drops
[884.22 --> 884.74]  the last
[884.74 --> 885.04]  line.
[885.04 --> 886.04]  God
[886.04 --> 887.04]  will be
[887.04 --> 887.40]  to the
[887.40 --> 888.04]  son.
[888.04 --> 888.98]  The line about him simply being a hired hand,
[889.98 --> 890.78]  not here,
[891.76 --> 893.18]  not in this kind of family.
[894.26 --> 894.62]  No,
[895.52 --> 903.00]  simply opting to be a servant who works for hire no longer makes sense in a family of such unconditional love and grace.
[903.00 --> 904.04]  And the son,
[904.22 --> 904.72]  in effect,
[904.90 --> 907.64]  receives his father's offer of humility,
[908.00 --> 911.42]  knowing that it's only by pure undeserved grace,
[911.66 --> 915.12]  and he is transformed in the arms of his father.
[915.28 --> 917.30]  He's not saved in the pig pen.
[918.52 --> 921.22]  God uses the pig pen in our lives,
[921.44 --> 923.70]  but it does not have the power to save us.
[924.98 --> 928.00]  Only the arms of the father can do that.
[928.70 --> 930.58]  It's the kindness of the Lord
[930.58 --> 933.06]  that leads us to repentance.
[935.18 --> 937.72]  But there's two boys in this story.
[939.26 --> 940.26]  Verse 25.
[941.76 --> 943.88]  Meanwhile, the older son was in the field,
[944.02 --> 945.36]  and when he came near the house,
[945.44 --> 946.66]  he heard music and dancing.
[947.24 --> 948.16]  So picture the scene.
[949.18 --> 951.58]  Looks a little bit like a Vincent Van Gogh painting.
[952.48 --> 954.78]  You know, the painting of the sower in the field.
[955.68 --> 956.80]  Mediterranean sun
[956.80 --> 959.00]  casting its long shadow
[959.00 --> 962.96]  on the large frame of the older brother.
[963.64 --> 964.96]  He's coming in late.
[965.10 --> 966.34]  He's worked long.
[966.68 --> 968.74]  In fact, the entire village is
[968.74 --> 971.42]  celebrating the return of the younger son.
[971.68 --> 972.28]  You might ask,
[972.40 --> 974.62]  why is the older brother working so late?
[975.98 --> 976.86]  Ask him.
[977.60 --> 978.26]  He'll tell you.
[979.14 --> 980.26]  I work late.
[980.26 --> 983.98]  Because since my younger brother ripped us off,
[984.54 --> 986.46]  one-third of the entire estate,
[986.78 --> 988.42]  I've had to do the job of two men.
[989.22 --> 990.60]  So he's hangry.
[991.66 --> 992.72]  He's thirsty.
[994.02 --> 997.30]  He gets to the house,
[997.70 --> 999.72]  and he smells beef,
[999.94 --> 1000.58]  and he goes,
[1000.72 --> 1002.56]  something is very, very wrong.
[1002.56 --> 1005.50]  He hears the sound of a bass drum,
[1005.94 --> 1008.28]  and the snap of a tambourine,
[1008.60 --> 1010.76]  and he hears people singing,
[1010.92 --> 1012.92]  and he looks through the window of the courtyard
[1012.92 --> 1015.30]  into where the entire village is,
[1015.34 --> 1016.42]  and it looks like a scene
[1016.42 --> 1019.44]  from The Fiddler on the Roof.
[1019.50 --> 1020.50]  It looks like a wedding,
[1020.84 --> 1022.20]  and they're singing and dancing,
[1022.42 --> 1023.98]  and who is leading the dance?
[1024.90 --> 1025.88]  His father.
[1027.68 --> 1029.54]  And the older brother is outraged,
[1029.54 --> 1031.84]  and he boycotts the party.
[1032.68 --> 1034.34]  So he called one of the servants,
[1034.42 --> 1035.00]  a young boy,
[1035.16 --> 1035.76]  and asked him,
[1035.94 --> 1036.94]  what's going on?
[1038.16 --> 1039.38]  Your brother has come,
[1039.44 --> 1039.98]  he replied.
[1040.90 --> 1042.06]  You haven't heard.
[1042.94 --> 1044.96]  And your father has killed the fattened calf
[1044.96 --> 1046.90]  because he has him back safe and sound.
[1047.30 --> 1047.78]  Powerful.
[1047.86 --> 1049.40]  The last phrase could be translated,
[1049.78 --> 1051.54]  because your dad has received
[1051.54 --> 1053.40]  your younger brother in peace,
[1053.88 --> 1054.58]  in shalom.
[1056.02 --> 1057.14]  In effect, he's saying,
[1057.14 --> 1059.22]  your father has opened his heart
[1059.22 --> 1059.94]  to a sinner,
[1060.18 --> 1060.98]  and we know that
[1060.98 --> 1062.26]  because he's dining with him.
[1064.78 --> 1066.16]  Without sufficient time
[1066.16 --> 1068.12]  to even test the sinner's sincerity,
[1068.30 --> 1070.26]  the father and the rebel are reconciled.
[1071.96 --> 1074.12]  And this makes the older brother very angry.
[1074.24 --> 1075.54]  His opinion about what to do
[1075.54 --> 1076.30]  with the younger brother
[1076.30 --> 1077.28]  has not been consulted.
[1079.04 --> 1080.92]  Now it's the older brother's turn
[1080.92 --> 1082.82]  to completely humiliate the father.
[1084.10 --> 1085.10]  Verse 28,
[1085.10 --> 1086.68]  the older brother became angry
[1086.68 --> 1088.66]  and refused to go in.
[1089.34 --> 1091.10]  So his father went out
[1091.10 --> 1093.26]  and pleaded with him.
[1093.48 --> 1094.68]  He entreated him.
[1095.06 --> 1097.30]  He went out with a party hat
[1097.30 --> 1097.86]  and he said,
[1097.96 --> 1098.62]  come on son,
[1099.04 --> 1099.76]  put this on.
[1101.06 --> 1102.84]  This is no time for this.
[1104.26 --> 1106.04]  This is time to offer grace
[1106.04 --> 1106.64]  to your brother.
[1107.90 --> 1108.36]  Really,
[1108.56 --> 1110.32]  what the father was offering
[1110.32 --> 1111.42]  the older son
[1111.42 --> 1112.58]  was an opportunity
[1112.58 --> 1114.60]  for conversion.
[1116.48 --> 1118.56]  For you can't receive
[1118.56 --> 1119.50]  the forgiveness
[1119.50 --> 1120.98]  and grace of God
[1120.98 --> 1122.26]  without a willingness
[1122.26 --> 1124.22]  to also extend it.
[1125.82 --> 1127.18]  But the older brother's
[1127.18 --> 1127.80]  not interested.
[1129.88 --> 1131.36]  This is the second time
[1131.36 --> 1131.96]  in one day
[1131.96 --> 1132.60]  where the father
[1132.60 --> 1133.66]  has left the home
[1133.66 --> 1134.96]  in pursuit of the sons.
[1135.20 --> 1136.42]  And it really tells us
[1136.42 --> 1137.40]  about the heart of Jesus
[1137.40 --> 1138.36]  who always leaves
[1138.36 --> 1139.78]  the 99 in open pasture
[1139.78 --> 1140.52]  and goes after
[1140.52 --> 1141.98]  the one lost sheep
[1141.98 --> 1142.94]  regardless of their
[1142.94 --> 1144.56]  particular flavor of sin,
[1144.68 --> 1145.98]  whether it's blue collar sin
[1145.98 --> 1147.52]  or white collar sin.
[1148.38 --> 1149.34]  But the older brother
[1149.34 --> 1150.26]  wants none of it.
[1150.30 --> 1151.22]  He doesn't understand
[1151.22 --> 1152.50]  this kind of radical grace
[1152.50 --> 1153.70]  because it's not the world
[1153.70 --> 1154.70]  he's chosen to live in.
[1155.00 --> 1155.94]  He's chosen to live
[1155.94 --> 1157.26]  in the world of justice.
[1158.22 --> 1159.16]  Where's the justice?
[1159.30 --> 1160.44]  He cries out to his dad.
[1161.26 --> 1162.18]  Where's the necessary
[1162.18 --> 1163.58]  humiliation of my brother?
[1163.98 --> 1164.78]  Where's the payment
[1164.78 --> 1165.86]  for crimes committed?
[1165.86 --> 1167.50]  Show me the money.
[1167.94 --> 1168.48]  Then maybe
[1168.48 --> 1170.56]  I will go into the party.
[1173.20 --> 1174.78]  See, the reinstatement
[1174.78 --> 1175.72]  of the younger brother
[1175.72 --> 1177.38]  had violated
[1177.38 --> 1179.04]  the village honor system.
[1180.36 --> 1181.24]  And for many of us,
[1181.30 --> 1183.28]  the idea of this kind of grace
[1183.28 --> 1184.76]  flies directly in the face
[1184.76 --> 1186.66]  of our inbred sense of fairness.
[1187.66 --> 1188.66]  But the fact is,
[1189.40 --> 1191.32]  in the gospel story,
[1192.14 --> 1193.90]  there's not just grace.
[1193.90 --> 1196.00]  There is justice.
[1197.92 --> 1200.66]  Somebody does have to pay.
[1201.54 --> 1202.56]  And in this story,
[1202.70 --> 1203.86]  somebody does pay.
[1203.98 --> 1204.98]  But what the older brother
[1204.98 --> 1206.78]  can't see and doesn't want to see
[1206.78 --> 1208.42]  is that it was his father
[1208.42 --> 1209.46]  who paid.
[1209.92 --> 1212.16]  He bore the prodigal shame
[1212.16 --> 1213.62]  and humiliation.
[1214.48 --> 1216.28]  God in Christ
[1216.28 --> 1218.04]  reconciling the world
[1218.04 --> 1219.16]  to himself.
[1219.16 --> 1222.54]  But by not going into the party,
[1222.64 --> 1223.38]  the older brother
[1223.38 --> 1225.18]  deeply insults his father.
[1225.46 --> 1226.06]  It's ironic.
[1226.54 --> 1228.32]  As one broken relationship
[1228.32 --> 1230.14]  is being restored inside,
[1230.78 --> 1231.98]  another relationship
[1231.98 --> 1233.72]  is being fractured.
[1233.86 --> 1234.66]  It's imploding.
[1235.00 --> 1235.80]  And all of this
[1235.80 --> 1236.28]  is happening
[1236.28 --> 1237.52]  during the banquet.
[1237.74 --> 1238.42]  It's public.
[1238.70 --> 1239.38]  People are saying,
[1239.60 --> 1240.30]  where's the host?
[1240.48 --> 1241.22]  Where did he go?
[1241.22 --> 1242.66]  I don't see him anywhere.
[1242.98 --> 1243.92]  And somebody else says,
[1244.00 --> 1244.68]  don't you know,
[1245.02 --> 1246.10]  his older son
[1246.10 --> 1247.26]  does not want to come
[1247.26 --> 1247.84]  into the party.
[1249.04 --> 1250.54]  He's begging him to come,
[1250.62 --> 1251.38]  but he refuses.
[1253.36 --> 1254.60]  And for the second time
[1254.60 --> 1255.40]  in one day,
[1255.54 --> 1258.04]  the father leaves the house
[1258.04 --> 1260.14]  to find each of his sons
[1260.14 --> 1262.14]  and he deals graciously
[1262.14 --> 1262.96]  for sin.
[1263.34 --> 1265.28]  Now for the second time
[1265.28 --> 1266.22]  in one story,
[1266.68 --> 1268.34]  the father endures
[1268.34 --> 1270.18]  the shame only this time.
[1270.30 --> 1270.84]  It's the shame
[1270.84 --> 1271.66]  of the older brother.
[1273.02 --> 1274.36]  And he initiates
[1274.36 --> 1275.12]  reconciliation.
[1275.12 --> 1276.58]  He doesn't demand it.
[1277.58 --> 1278.72]  He knows that love
[1278.72 --> 1279.88]  doesn't work that way.
[1281.60 --> 1282.72]  But the older brother
[1282.72 --> 1283.72]  answered his father,
[1283.92 --> 1284.14]  look,
[1284.68 --> 1285.58]  all these years
[1285.58 --> 1286.80]  I've been slaving for you
[1286.80 --> 1287.82]  and never disobeyed
[1287.82 --> 1288.34]  your orders,
[1288.64 --> 1289.58]  yet you never even
[1289.58 --> 1290.60]  gave me a goat
[1290.60 --> 1291.78]  so I could celebrate
[1291.78 --> 1292.70]  with my friends.
[1293.08 --> 1294.60]  But when this son of yours
[1294.60 --> 1295.44]  who has squandered
[1295.44 --> 1296.02]  your property
[1296.02 --> 1296.88]  with prostitutes
[1296.88 --> 1297.54]  comes home,
[1297.92 --> 1299.50]  you kill the fattened calf
[1299.50 --> 1300.22]  for him.
[1301.74 --> 1302.62]  And in these
[1302.62 --> 1303.60]  well-known words,
[1303.72 --> 1304.82]  the older brother's heart
[1304.82 --> 1306.40]  is fully exposed.
[1307.28 --> 1308.68]  And my heart
[1308.68 --> 1311.22]  is fully exposed.
[1312.26 --> 1313.74]  The older brother
[1313.74 --> 1314.92]  is blind
[1314.92 --> 1316.82]  to his true condition.
[1317.38 --> 1318.04]  He too
[1318.04 --> 1318.96]  is a rebel
[1318.96 --> 1321.00]  just like the younger son.
[1321.28 --> 1321.96]  He's just
[1321.96 --> 1322.70]  a rebel
[1322.70 --> 1323.58]  at home.
[1324.64 --> 1326.04]  He's on the farm
[1326.04 --> 1326.96]  but he's lost.
[1326.96 --> 1329.36]  He's physically close
[1329.36 --> 1330.14]  to his father
[1330.14 --> 1330.82]  but distant
[1330.82 --> 1332.72]  in ways that really matter
[1332.72 --> 1333.70]  like a married couple
[1333.70 --> 1335.02]  sharing the same house
[1335.02 --> 1335.92]  but living completely
[1335.92 --> 1336.98]  independent lives.
[1337.56 --> 1338.46]  Or like a couple
[1338.46 --> 1339.24]  who are
[1339.24 --> 1341.06]  side by side
[1341.06 --> 1342.46]  moving through life
[1342.46 --> 1343.98]  getting the job done
[1343.98 --> 1345.32]  but they are no longer
[1345.32 --> 1346.78]  face to face.
[1347.62 --> 1348.92]  The intimacy
[1348.92 --> 1350.78]  has been lost
[1350.78 --> 1351.56]  and perhaps
[1351.56 --> 1352.58]  there never was.
[1352.58 --> 1354.76]  the older brother
[1354.76 --> 1355.98]  is a joyless
[1355.98 --> 1356.94]  law keeper
[1356.94 --> 1357.54]  isn't he?
[1357.62 --> 1358.50]  He is Javert
[1358.50 --> 1360.20]  in Les Miserables.
[1360.54 --> 1361.82]  He is an angry man
[1361.82 --> 1362.92]  hateful of his brother
[1362.92 --> 1364.08]  hateful of his father.
[1364.50 --> 1365.02]  He appears
[1365.02 --> 1366.90]  hopelessly narcissistic.
[1367.26 --> 1367.78]  He says
[1367.78 --> 1368.30]  Dad
[1368.30 --> 1369.48]  you've never even
[1369.48 --> 1370.30]  given me
[1370.30 --> 1371.06]  a goat
[1371.06 --> 1371.86]  to celebrate
[1371.86 --> 1373.34]  with my friends
[1373.34 --> 1373.98]  but you throw
[1373.98 --> 1374.98]  the mother of parties
[1374.98 --> 1375.74]  for this loser.
[1375.74 --> 1378.76]  And if you remember
[1378.76 --> 1379.96]  we were quite hard
[1379.96 --> 1380.86]  on the younger brother
[1380.86 --> 1381.96]  when he was satisfied
[1381.96 --> 1382.64]  to simply
[1382.64 --> 1383.88]  serve his father
[1383.88 --> 1384.78]  as a slave
[1384.78 --> 1385.98]  as a hired hand
[1385.98 --> 1387.10]  but the older brother
[1387.10 --> 1388.26]  is doing exactly
[1388.26 --> 1390.02]  the same thing.
[1390.62 --> 1391.94]  He sees himself
[1391.94 --> 1392.86]  as a slave
[1392.86 --> 1393.64]  who has earned
[1393.64 --> 1394.62]  certain rewards
[1394.62 --> 1395.52]  for good behavior.
[1395.90 --> 1396.40]  He says
[1396.40 --> 1397.78]  I've been slaving
[1397.78 --> 1398.24]  for you
[1398.24 --> 1399.28]  all these years
[1399.28 --> 1400.16]  and you've never
[1400.16 --> 1400.84]  come through
[1400.84 --> 1401.72]  with your end
[1401.72 --> 1402.18]  of the bargain.
[1402.18 --> 1406.08]  And so we have
[1406.08 --> 1407.52]  a painting
[1407.52 --> 1409.10]  Visio Divina.
[1410.22 --> 1411.48]  We have the father
[1411.48 --> 1412.00]  in the middle.
[1413.52 --> 1414.26]  He has already
[1414.26 --> 1414.80]  embraced
[1414.80 --> 1415.72]  the younger son
[1415.72 --> 1416.46]  on the left.
[1417.78 --> 1418.80]  Every touch
[1418.80 --> 1420.06]  of the father's
[1420.06 --> 1420.70]  love
[1420.70 --> 1422.12]  brings healing
[1422.12 --> 1422.92]  and hope
[1422.92 --> 1424.44]  to the younger son.
[1424.86 --> 1425.22]  Notice
[1425.22 --> 1426.40]  the part of his arm
[1426.40 --> 1427.48]  that has not been touched
[1427.48 --> 1428.62]  is still dark.
[1429.04 --> 1430.34]  The other part
[1430.34 --> 1430.96]  is light.
[1430.96 --> 1432.38]  It's like
[1432.38 --> 1433.20]  the purity
[1433.20 --> 1434.28]  of the father
[1434.28 --> 1434.92]  is going to be
[1434.92 --> 1435.48]  imputed
[1435.48 --> 1436.60]  to the sin
[1436.60 --> 1437.62]  of the younger son.
[1438.08 --> 1439.44]  Someone would ask
[1439.44 --> 1441.06]  who paid the price
[1441.06 --> 1442.28]  and this particular artist
[1442.28 --> 1444.14]  puts the fattened calf
[1444.14 --> 1444.96]  or the lamb
[1444.96 --> 1446.00]  in between
[1446.00 --> 1446.80]  the father
[1446.80 --> 1447.94]  and the son.
[1448.20 --> 1449.12]  There was blood
[1449.12 --> 1449.76]  shed.
[1450.42 --> 1451.06]  But there's another
[1451.06 --> 1452.12]  brother in the story.
[1453.40 --> 1455.10]  But he's red-faced.
[1456.04 --> 1456.94]  He cannot look
[1456.94 --> 1457.66]  at his father.
[1458.46 --> 1459.08]  He's turned
[1459.08 --> 1460.16]  his back to him.
[1460.16 --> 1461.42]  He's also
[1461.42 --> 1462.58]  waving a flag.
[1462.76 --> 1463.52]  What is the flag
[1463.52 --> 1464.10]  that he's waving?
[1464.18 --> 1464.70]  It's the flag
[1464.70 --> 1465.34]  of injustice.
[1466.42 --> 1467.12]  He's saying
[1467.12 --> 1468.70]  this is not right.
[1469.42 --> 1470.44]  Somebody has
[1470.44 --> 1471.04]  to pay.
[1471.60 --> 1472.20]  And with the
[1472.20 --> 1473.16]  other fist
[1473.16 --> 1474.46]  it's coming up
[1474.46 --> 1475.66]  under the jaw
[1475.66 --> 1476.36]  of the younger
[1476.36 --> 1477.04]  brother.
[1477.32 --> 1477.94]  He's saying
[1477.94 --> 1478.86]  to his father
[1478.86 --> 1479.78]  if you don't
[1479.78 --> 1480.54]  have the guts
[1480.54 --> 1482.00]  to take revenge
[1482.00 --> 1483.36]  on my younger brother
[1483.36 --> 1484.54]  I will do it.
[1484.54 --> 1485.36]  I will be
[1485.36 --> 1486.18]  the vigilante
[1486.18 --> 1487.50]  in this story.
[1490.70 --> 1491.22]  What's
[1491.22 --> 1491.80]  Jesus
[1491.80 --> 1492.62]  saying
[1492.62 --> 1494.34]  to his church?
[1496.72 --> 1497.90]  What's he saying
[1497.90 --> 1498.60]  to us?
[1499.76 --> 1500.58]  He's making
[1500.58 --> 1501.38]  a theological
[1501.38 --> 1501.86]  point
[1501.86 --> 1502.32]  isn't he?
[1503.18 --> 1503.88]  That the younger
[1503.88 --> 1504.88]  son represents
[1504.88 --> 1505.90]  the tax collectors
[1505.90 --> 1506.94]  and the prostitutes
[1506.94 --> 1507.54]  and the sinners
[1507.54 --> 1508.74]  those that are
[1508.74 --> 1509.64]  getting front row
[1509.64 --> 1510.30]  seats at the
[1510.30 --> 1510.86]  marriage supper
[1510.86 --> 1511.40]  of the lamb
[1511.40 --> 1512.46]  and the older
[1512.46 --> 1513.44]  son represents
[1513.44 --> 1514.24]  the Pharisees
[1514.24 --> 1514.90]  who are demanding
[1514.90 --> 1515.60]  Jesus to give
[1515.60 --> 1516.02]  an account
[1516.02 --> 1516.64]  for why he
[1516.64 --> 1517.28]  welcomes such
[1517.28 --> 1517.62]  people.
[1520.16 --> 1521.24]  Where does
[1521.24 --> 1521.94]  the parable
[1521.94 --> 1523.34]  touch you?
[1525.04 --> 1526.02]  Let me share
[1526.02 --> 1526.80]  two thoughts
[1526.80 --> 1527.40]  in closing.
[1528.28 --> 1528.82]  One is an
[1528.82 --> 1529.40]  observation
[1529.40 --> 1530.56]  that I've made
[1530.56 --> 1531.26]  about us
[1531.26 --> 1531.90]  church people
[1531.90 --> 1533.00]  over the last
[1533.00 --> 1533.66]  few decades
[1533.66 --> 1535.32]  and the other
[1535.32 --> 1536.46]  observation is
[1536.46 --> 1536.92]  something I've
[1536.92 --> 1537.52]  seen in my own
[1537.52 --> 1539.16]  heart as an
[1539.16 --> 1539.60]  older brother.
[1540.64 --> 1541.04]  First,
[1541.40 --> 1542.96]  I think the
[1542.96 --> 1543.62]  one thing
[1543.62 --> 1545.34]  that keeps
[1545.34 --> 1545.88]  the largest
[1545.88 --> 1546.48]  number of
[1546.48 --> 1547.36]  Christians back
[1547.36 --> 1548.04]  from really
[1548.04 --> 1548.78]  pressing in
[1548.78 --> 1549.60]  to know God
[1549.60 --> 1550.20]  is that their
[1550.20 --> 1551.52]  concept of God
[1551.52 --> 1552.06]  the Father
[1552.06 --> 1553.18]  is wrong.
[1553.88 --> 1554.70]  It's preventing
[1554.70 --> 1556.38]  us from getting
[1556.38 --> 1557.12]  to know him.
[1557.46 --> 1558.28]  Like the older
[1558.28 --> 1559.18]  brother, we view
[1559.18 --> 1559.90]  our relationship
[1559.90 --> 1560.74]  with God more
[1560.74 --> 1561.90]  like a contract
[1561.90 --> 1563.00]  than a covenant
[1563.00 --> 1564.12]  and we believe
[1564.12 --> 1565.18]  that God honors
[1565.18 --> 1565.94]  good behavior
[1565.94 --> 1566.86]  with a good life
[1566.86 --> 1567.52]  and in typical
[1567.52 --> 1568.62]  older brother style
[1568.62 --> 1569.52]  most of us
[1569.52 --> 1570.44]  older brother types
[1570.44 --> 1571.36]  naturally believe
[1571.36 --> 1571.90]  that we've had
[1571.90 --> 1572.62]  sufficiently good
[1572.62 --> 1572.98]  behavior.
[1573.98 --> 1574.94]  Unlike the younger
[1574.94 --> 1575.58]  brother, we've
[1575.58 --> 1576.32]  stayed in church.
[1576.82 --> 1577.34]  Look at us.
[1578.38 --> 1579.02]  What a beautiful
[1579.02 --> 1579.78]  group we are.
[1581.00 --> 1581.72]  We tithe
[1581.72 --> 1583.20]  as we were
[1583.20 --> 1584.44]  commended to do
[1584.44 --> 1584.82]  today.
[1585.26 --> 1585.84]  We serve.
[1586.74 --> 1587.16]  Many of you
[1587.16 --> 1588.02]  serve kids and
[1588.02 --> 1588.36]  youth.
[1589.18 --> 1589.80]  You serve at the
[1589.80 --> 1590.54]  Cloverdale Community
[1590.54 --> 1590.94]  Kitchen.
[1591.30 --> 1591.94]  I know that.
[1592.62 --> 1593.32]  We've seen you
[1593.32 --> 1593.56]  there.
[1594.60 --> 1595.26]  We've avoided
[1595.26 --> 1595.94]  most of the
[1595.94 --> 1596.84]  dirty sins.
[1596.84 --> 1596.90]  things.
[1598.46 --> 1599.28]  And as a result,
[1599.46 --> 1600.50]  though we never
[1600.50 --> 1601.48]  say it out loud,
[1601.60 --> 1602.34]  we believe that
[1602.34 --> 1603.36]  God owes us
[1603.36 --> 1603.86]  something.
[1604.64 --> 1605.48]  And this attitude
[1605.48 --> 1606.64]  is only exposed
[1606.64 --> 1607.76]  when we experience
[1607.76 --> 1608.90]  the loss of
[1608.90 --> 1610.02]  something very
[1610.02 --> 1611.34]  precious to us.
[1612.50 --> 1614.16]  A dream that we
[1614.16 --> 1615.04]  have is completely
[1615.04 --> 1615.62]  dashed.
[1616.28 --> 1617.48]  Cancer attacks
[1617.48 --> 1618.14]  the family.
[1619.14 --> 1619.78]  Heaven forbid
[1619.78 --> 1620.92]  a child dies.
[1621.66 --> 1622.14]  A marriage
[1622.14 --> 1622.82]  dissolves.
[1622.82 --> 1624.38]  A job is lost.
[1624.92 --> 1625.60]  A nest egg
[1625.60 --> 1626.20]  diminishes.
[1626.80 --> 1627.70]  Early dementia
[1627.70 --> 1628.58]  sets in.
[1629.20 --> 1629.58]  And it's
[1629.58 --> 1630.10]  devastating.
[1631.42 --> 1632.44]  And the attitude
[1632.44 --> 1633.76]  that often emerges
[1633.76 --> 1635.46]  is, what have I
[1635.46 --> 1636.24]  done, God, to
[1636.24 --> 1636.96]  deserve this?
[1638.48 --> 1639.76]  Where now is the
[1639.76 --> 1640.82]  faithfulness of God
[1640.82 --> 1641.58]  in light of my
[1641.58 --> 1642.54]  faithfulness to Him?
[1643.64 --> 1644.62]  And it's a common
[1644.62 --> 1645.76]  response, but it
[1645.76 --> 1646.80]  reveals that we
[1646.80 --> 1648.66]  view ourselves as
[1648.66 --> 1649.88]  servants, not
[1649.88 --> 1650.36]  daughters.
[1651.26 --> 1652.24]  Servants, not
[1652.24 --> 1652.66]  sons.
[1653.68 --> 1654.64]  Servants whose
[1654.64 --> 1656.18]  good behavior now
[1656.18 --> 1657.22]  entitles us to
[1657.22 --> 1658.12]  certain blessings
[1658.12 --> 1659.46]  or rewards, and
[1659.46 --> 1660.16]  when the rewards
[1660.16 --> 1661.20]  don't come or
[1661.20 --> 1662.06]  they are removed,
[1662.44 --> 1663.58]  we take it out
[1663.58 --> 1664.64]  on God.
[1665.32 --> 1666.80]  We turn our face
[1666.80 --> 1667.90]  away from Him in
[1667.90 --> 1668.20]  anger.
[1668.64 --> 1669.28]  We are like
[1669.28 --> 1670.58]  Asaph in Psalm
[1670.58 --> 1672.44]  73 who said,
[1672.84 --> 1674.00]  I became like a
[1674.00 --> 1675.06]  brute beast
[1675.06 --> 1675.98]  before you
[1675.98 --> 1677.82]  because I had
[1677.82 --> 1679.36]  nothing and all
[1679.36 --> 1680.28]  of my pagan
[1680.28 --> 1681.04]  brothers and
[1681.04 --> 1681.66]  sisters were
[1681.66 --> 1682.18]  winning the
[1682.18 --> 1682.60]  lottery.
[1682.82 --> 1684.38]  and it's not
[1684.38 --> 1685.34]  fair.
[1687.14 --> 1688.72]  Then Asaph
[1688.72 --> 1689.92]  had a
[1689.92 --> 1690.36]  breakthrough.
[1691.56 --> 1692.60]  The question
[1692.60 --> 1693.54]  is, will the
[1693.54 --> 1694.32]  older brother
[1694.32 --> 1695.92]  in the story
[1695.92 --> 1697.20]  have the same
[1697.20 --> 1698.20]  breakthrough?
[1699.14 --> 1700.54]  I can tell you
[1700.54 --> 1701.30]  that the story
[1701.30 --> 1702.38]  before us today
[1702.38 --> 1703.08]  instead of
[1703.08 --> 1703.92]  condemning us
[1703.92 --> 1704.50]  older brother
[1704.50 --> 1705.56]  types, offers
[1705.56 --> 1706.64]  the same grace
[1706.64 --> 1708.68]  as is offered
[1708.68 --> 1709.40]  to the younger
[1709.40 --> 1710.96]  brother and
[1710.96 --> 1711.28]  sister.
[1711.28 --> 1713.30]  But receiving
[1713.30 --> 1714.34]  this grace
[1714.34 --> 1715.06]  will involve
[1715.06 --> 1715.78]  an accurate
[1715.78 --> 1716.84]  self-assessment
[1716.84 --> 1717.60]  and the
[1717.60 --> 1718.64]  gratitude and
[1718.64 --> 1719.68]  humility which
[1719.68 --> 1720.72]  will lead to
[1720.72 --> 1721.18]  repentance.
[1722.02 --> 1723.10]  It's what we
[1723.10 --> 1724.08]  haven't yet seen
[1724.08 --> 1724.58]  in the older
[1724.58 --> 1725.26]  brother in our
[1725.26 --> 1725.66]  story.
[1725.92 --> 1726.78]  Like the story
[1726.78 --> 1727.94]  of Jonah, we
[1727.94 --> 1729.50]  don't know how
[1729.50 --> 1730.70]  it's going to
[1730.70 --> 1731.02]  end.
[1731.48 --> 1732.26]  The verdict is
[1732.26 --> 1732.52]  out.
[1732.52 --> 1736.14]  Secondly, I
[1736.14 --> 1736.52]  know from
[1736.52 --> 1737.70]  personal experience
[1737.70 --> 1738.32]  that the
[1738.32 --> 1739.72]  arrogance and
[1739.72 --> 1740.82]  the self-righteousness
[1740.82 --> 1741.10]  and the
[1741.10 --> 1742.72]  judgmentalism that
[1742.72 --> 1743.34]  I've seen in my
[1743.34 --> 1744.66]  own heart not
[1744.66 --> 1745.90]  only affects my
[1745.90 --> 1746.64]  relationship with
[1746.64 --> 1748.08]  God, but it
[1748.08 --> 1748.92]  affects my
[1748.92 --> 1750.24]  relationship with
[1750.24 --> 1751.26]  you, with my
[1751.26 --> 1751.66]  brothers and
[1751.66 --> 1751.92]  sisters.
[1751.92 --> 1753.26]  brothers and
[1753.26 --> 1753.28]  sisters.
[1753.28 --> 1753.76]  It affects my
[1753.76 --> 1754.46]  relationship with
[1754.46 --> 1755.22]  my own siblings.
[1756.88 --> 1758.06]  It affects my
[1758.06 --> 1759.42]  relationship with
[1759.42 --> 1760.72]  people whose sins
[1760.72 --> 1761.62]  look differently
[1761.62 --> 1763.32]  than mine.
[1765.30 --> 1766.82]  When I was 13
[1766.82 --> 1767.46]  and my brother
[1767.46 --> 1768.60]  was 7, our
[1768.60 --> 1769.60]  family experienced
[1769.60 --> 1770.42]  such a tragedy.
[1771.06 --> 1771.94]  My mother died
[1771.94 --> 1772.94]  of a brain tumor.
[1773.76 --> 1774.64]  She was 36.
[1775.40 --> 1777.26]  And the size of
[1777.26 --> 1778.38]  hole left in my
[1778.38 --> 1779.08]  heart and in my
[1779.08 --> 1780.08]  brother's heart was
[1780.08 --> 1780.92]  enormous as you
[1780.92 --> 1781.34]  can imagine.
[1782.86 --> 1783.74]  Through the
[1783.74 --> 1784.48]  tragedy of my
[1784.48 --> 1785.26]  mom's death, I
[1785.26 --> 1786.10]  actually encountered
[1786.10 --> 1786.90]  the presence of
[1786.90 --> 1787.96]  God, was
[1787.96 --> 1789.14]  transformed by it.
[1789.22 --> 1790.56]  It probably was my
[1790.56 --> 1791.52]  conversion experience
[1791.52 --> 1792.34]  or my burning bush
[1792.34 --> 1793.48]  experience at least.
[1794.02 --> 1795.08]  And I was old
[1795.08 --> 1795.68]  enough, I was a
[1795.68 --> 1796.86]  teenager, so that
[1796.86 --> 1798.36]  the youth leaders
[1798.36 --> 1799.20]  in the church could
[1799.20 --> 1800.26]  get a hold of me
[1800.26 --> 1801.34]  and walk me through
[1801.34 --> 1802.40]  this horrendous
[1802.40 --> 1803.48]  grieving experience.
[1804.20 --> 1804.76]  And they did.
[1805.94 --> 1806.56]  But my brother,
[1806.78 --> 1808.32]  who was 7, did not
[1808.32 --> 1808.94]  have such an
[1808.94 --> 1809.36]  opportunity.
[1810.42 --> 1811.34]  When I acted
[1811.34 --> 1812.68]  out, I had people
[1812.68 --> 1813.88]  that pulled me in.
[1814.50 --> 1815.00]  But when my
[1815.00 --> 1816.22]  brother, who was a
[1816.22 --> 1817.72]  normal kid, acted
[1817.72 --> 1819.16]  out, he was told to
[1819.16 --> 1819.68]  go play.
[1820.84 --> 1821.80]  None of us had
[1821.80 --> 1823.44]  grief counseling or
[1823.44 --> 1824.48]  grief recovery in
[1824.48 --> 1825.04]  those days.
[1826.66 --> 1828.84]  And as I continued
[1828.84 --> 1830.24]  on as a teenager and
[1830.24 --> 1831.18]  into my young adult
[1831.18 --> 1833.14]  years, I look back
[1833.14 --> 1835.08]  at those years where
[1835.08 --> 1836.74]  my brother-in-law lived
[1836.74 --> 1837.84]  under the same roof
[1837.84 --> 1839.34]  with our father.
[1840.68 --> 1842.24]  And I realized that
[1842.24 --> 1843.24]  instead of me
[1843.24 --> 1845.34]  nurturing my son,
[1845.48 --> 1847.82]  my brother, I
[1847.82 --> 1848.46]  bullied him.
[1849.48 --> 1850.34]  And it was a few
[1850.34 --> 1851.92]  years ago, while I
[1851.92 --> 1853.08]  was pastoring, not
[1853.08 --> 1853.98]  that far down the
[1853.98 --> 1855.80]  road, that I got a
[1855.80 --> 1856.76]  tap on the shoulder
[1856.76 --> 1858.08]  by the Holy Spirit
[1858.08 --> 1861.38]  who said, Brian, you
[1861.38 --> 1862.08]  have unfinished
[1862.08 --> 1863.08]  business at home.
[1863.08 --> 1865.44]  You need to make
[1865.44 --> 1866.68]  the journey to the
[1866.68 --> 1867.56]  city where you and
[1867.56 --> 1868.22]  your brother were
[1868.22 --> 1870.06]  raised and revisit
[1870.06 --> 1870.92]  those years.
[1871.96 --> 1872.88]  And I did.
[1875.42 --> 1876.48]  I visited our
[1876.48 --> 1878.26]  old home where my
[1878.26 --> 1879.00]  mother died.
[1879.54 --> 1880.26]  I visited the
[1880.26 --> 1881.10]  schools that I went
[1881.10 --> 1882.86]  to and wept.
[1884.18 --> 1884.96]  And then my
[1884.96 --> 1885.70]  brother and I went
[1885.70 --> 1886.20]  for dinner.
[1887.32 --> 1888.70]  And I expressed my
[1888.70 --> 1890.70]  deep remorse over
[1890.70 --> 1891.78]  what I could have
[1891.78 --> 1892.84]  given him but didn't.
[1894.64 --> 1896.80]  Confessed my sins
[1896.80 --> 1897.58]  of commission,
[1898.14 --> 1898.96]  things I had done
[1898.96 --> 1900.84]  to him that were
[1900.84 --> 1901.68]  so unkind.
[1905.00 --> 1906.08]  Here's what I know
[1906.08 --> 1908.56]  about life and
[1908.56 --> 1909.30]  about the story
[1909.30 --> 1909.94]  of the prodigal
[1909.94 --> 1910.26]  son.
[1911.44 --> 1913.34]  You may be more
[1913.34 --> 1914.32]  like the younger
[1914.32 --> 1916.56]  brother, or you
[1916.56 --> 1917.60]  may be more like
[1917.60 --> 1918.68]  the older brother,
[1918.82 --> 1919.60]  or you may have a
[1919.60 --> 1920.26]  really wonderful
[1920.26 --> 1921.34]  combination of both.
[1921.78 --> 1923.76]  But whether you
[1923.76 --> 1924.90]  lean towards law
[1924.90 --> 1925.92]  keeping or law
[1925.92 --> 1927.66]  breaking, sin is
[1927.66 --> 1929.12]  primarily relational.
[1930.94 --> 1931.88]  And because of our
[1931.88 --> 1933.72]  selfishness, we turn
[1933.72 --> 1935.68]  our face away from
[1935.68 --> 1937.24]  God and away from
[1937.24 --> 1938.12]  others who are
[1938.12 --> 1938.98]  different than
[1938.98 --> 1939.40]  ourselves.
[1939.40 --> 1942.90]  God and we also
[1942.90 --> 1944.10]  know from this story
[1944.10 --> 1945.82]  that God in the
[1945.82 --> 1947.10]  person of Jesus
[1947.10 --> 1948.52]  Christ comes
[1948.52 --> 1950.64]  after us all
[1950.64 --> 1951.94]  and in his
[1951.94 --> 1953.52]  reconciling power
[1953.52 --> 1955.06]  not only pulls us
[1955.06 --> 1956.48]  into himself
[1956.48 --> 1957.96]  to reconcile us
[1957.96 --> 1958.90]  with him through
[1958.90 --> 1959.88]  his shed blood on
[1959.88 --> 1961.44]  the cross, but he
[1961.44 --> 1962.64]  reconciles us
[1962.64 --> 1964.88]  with each other.
[1964.88 --> 1971.94]  God will move us
[1971.94 --> 1972.86]  in all of our
[1972.86 --> 1974.94]  hearts and move
[1975.66 --> 1976.96]  us in the direction
[1976.96 --> 1978.88]  towards him and
[1979.80 --> 1981.24]  towards our siblings
[1981.24 --> 1983.06]  that we may be
[1983.06 --> 1983.76]  distant from.
[1985.12 --> 1986.54]  Oh Holy Spirit,
[1987.42 --> 1988.60]  take this message
[1988.60 --> 1990.06]  this morning and
[1990.06 --> 1991.94]  seal it to all of
[1991.94 --> 1992.48]  our hearts.
[1995.22 --> 1996.44]  In Jesus' name we
[1996.44 --> 1996.74]  pray.
[1997.48 --> 1997.78]  Amen.
