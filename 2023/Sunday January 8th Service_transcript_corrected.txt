[0.00 → 7.28] Well, Hope, next week we're going to be starting a new sermon series on the book of Jonah.
[8.06 → 12.20] But today I thought it would be fitting to connect a bit with what Jonathan preached on last week
[12.20 → 16.42] and also tie it into this membership welcome, what it means to be the church
[16.42 → 20.04] and how to live out our identity as believers in our city today.
[20.04 → 26.84] So if you have your Bibles, turn with me to 1 Peter 2, actually, and we're going to read verse 9 to 12.
[30.00 → 41.10] But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession,
[41.56 → 47.06] that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
[47.56 → 51.30] Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God.
[51.88 → 55.74] Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[55.74 → 64.22] Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from the sinful desires which war against your soul.
[65.18 → 70.54] Live such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong,
[71.00 → 75.72] they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
[75.72 → 87.06] A number of years ago I went to a conference, it was a pastor's conference,
[88.06 → 91.36] and the conference was focused on sort of revitalizing the church.
[92.30 → 96.70] And I remember the main speaker, first thing in the morning, asked a question that has stuck with me ever since.
[96.78 → 98.02] And the question is this, he said,
[98.02 → 103.14] If your church closed up tomorrow, would your neighbourhood miss it?
[103.98 → 107.24] If you stopped gathering entirely and never met again,
[107.36 → 112.60] would anybody have a tangible sense of loss that your church is no longer in their city?
[113.82 → 114.74] It's a good question.
[115.76 → 119.30] It actually makes me wonder if we were to go around to our neighbours who live around here
[119.30 → 122.20] or maybe some of the business owners who are nearby us and just ask them,
[122.20 → 124.16] What's Hope Community Church all about?
[124.56 → 126.60] What are they up to in this community?
[126.80 → 128.48] I'm curious what they would say.
[129.34 → 133.36] What words they would use to describe us gathering for worship in our lives in the city?
[133.46 → 136.70] What adjectives they would use to talk about this church?
[138.28 → 140.78] I remember, and maybe you do too, some of us,
[140.88 → 144.90] when the Coverdale Reporter published a very generous, kind article about our church,
[145.00 → 146.60] talking about the headline actually being,
[147.00 → 149.58] Community Church, Built with Community Needs in Mind.
[149.58 → 152.42] When that article was published at the building was built,
[152.62 → 155.90] I remember the first comment in the online article was this,
[156.20 → 157.20] very kind and generous.
[157.54 → 158.32] The person wrote,
[158.82 → 161.84] Great, just what the world doesn't need.
[162.60 → 164.84] A private clubhouse for believers.
[165.74 → 167.22] That was the first comment written,
[167.56 → 170.08] and it's always been a bit of a challenge to me, a good one.
[170.72 → 174.02] But he summarized what I think people often assume about church,
[174.50 → 176.94] that it's a little private clubhouse for believers.
[176.94 → 181.32] And I would even go so far as to say sometimes in our own imaginations,
[181.32 → 182.98] when we think of what it means to be the church,
[183.22 → 185.74] we think of church as a Sunday gathering,
[186.16 → 188.10] where we go to a building, and we sing some songs,
[188.74 → 190.84] important and critical though it is,
[191.18 → 192.58] we see that as all the churches.
[193.30 → 195.60] In our family, Brittany and I try to make a point of saying to our kids,
[195.88 → 197.08] we are not going to church.
[197.64 → 198.74] We are the church.
[199.14 → 200.22] We're going to worship.
[201.06 → 202.12] It doesn't work all the time.
[202.12 → 203.10] We still say it ourselves.
[203.48 → 207.28] But the point is that the church is not just what's happening here on Sunday,
[207.74 → 209.82] but that Sunday must connect to the rest of the week.
[209.86 → 210.76] And if you were here last week,
[211.10 → 214.82] Pastor Jonathan highlighted the way in which the church must exist
[214.82 → 216.62] for the sake of the city.
[217.38 → 219.50] All that we do here in the preaching of the word
[219.50 → 221.00] and the receiving of the sacraments,
[221.06 → 222.16] the prayer and the worship,
[222.36 → 225.06] that is all to form us and forge us in the way of Jesus
[225.06 → 229.72] such that blessing flows through us into the city from Monday to Saturday.
[230.64 → 232.88] The church exists for the sake of the city.
[234.48 → 238.32] 1 Peter 2 is very interested in the question
[238.32 → 241.88] of how is the church supposed to relate to the city?
[242.38 → 245.96] How is the church supposed to be the church in the city in which they live?
[245.98 → 248.20] And I picked this passage so that we can understand,
[248.32 → 249.50] even as we think about membership,
[249.94 → 252.56] what it means to be part of a church in a city.
[252.56 → 257.44] And you'll see that Peter has a real interest in seeing them as set apart,
[258.00 → 261.58] yet living very much in and for the city.
[263.00 → 265.34] One of the intriguing things about this passage to me
[265.34 → 267.96] that has sort of shaped the undergirding pieces of this
[267.96 → 272.38] is that the people that Peter is writing to are being persecuted.
[273.12 → 275.62] And you can imagine how they might feel about their city,
[275.70 → 278.14] the feelings they would have towards those who are persecuting them
[278.14 → 280.06] and bringing them from positions of power.
[280.18 → 281.28] They've lost social status.
[281.28 → 284.48] To become a Christian then, to become a member of a church then,
[284.54 → 285.52] is to count the cost.
[286.20 → 287.78] They lost a lot.
[288.38 → 291.26] And yet Peter has some very challenging words on how to be the church
[291.26 → 293.38] and still bless the city.
[294.74 → 296.52] I'm convinced at the beginning of our passage
[296.52 → 298.96] is Peter's way of encouraging the church.
[299.60 → 300.44] It's his way of saying to them,
[300.50 → 303.08] I know you've sacrificed a lot to be in this community.
[303.16 → 306.02] I know you've given up status and social prestige
[306.02 → 307.76] to be part of this thing that is a church.
[307.76 → 311.38] And don't worry, church, because in Christ you've gained everything.
[312.30 → 315.64] That's why he says, you are God's special possession.
[315.86 → 316.96] You're a royal priesthood.
[317.24 → 321.12] Once you didn't know truth or mercy, but now, church, you have.
[321.68 → 325.60] You may have lost a lot culturally, but you've gained everything in Jesus.
[326.60 → 327.96] That's the beauty of being a believer,
[328.30 → 329.88] of being grafted into God's family.
[329.88 → 333.36] The life of the resurrection lives among us.
[335.06 → 338.66] I'm going to focus our attention this morning on verses 11 and 12.
[339.76 → 342.70] And let me read again for us what Peter writes in verse 11.
[342.84 → 343.76] He starts by saying,
[344.00 → 344.66] Dear friends,
[345.56 → 349.18] I urge you as foreigners and exiles
[349.18 → 354.18] to abstain from the sinful desires that war against your soul.
[355.92 → 356.50] I don't know about you,
[356.50 → 360.40] but I'm really intrigued by that phrase, foreigners and exiles.
[361.34 → 363.02] Now, if you've moved from one place to another,
[363.12 → 364.44] one country or culture to another,
[364.54 → 366.94] you actually know what it feels like to be the foreigner.
[367.08 → 368.16] You dress a little bit differently.
[368.36 → 369.34] You speak a little bit differently.
[369.54 → 371.32] You just can't quite fit in.
[371.74 → 374.32] And Peter uses that language to describe the church,
[374.54 → 376.16] not because they're from other places.
[376.78 → 378.64] They grew up in the cities that they're worshipping in.
[378.90 → 380.50] The reason he's saying it is
[380.50 → 384.48] that the way they live sets them apart.
[384.48 → 387.64] Their distinctive lifestyle of following Jesus
[387.64 → 389.16] is what makes them not fit in.
[389.20 → 390.32] Not their words, not their dress,
[390.58 → 393.20] but their distinctive lifestyle sets them apart
[393.20 → 395.10] in the Roman society.
[396.02 → 398.08] They have learned how to sort of steer away
[398.08 → 399.60] from the idolatrous way of Rome
[399.60 → 401.44] and follow the way of Jesus.
[402.18 → 404.08] And it hasn't been easy.
[404.90 → 406.42] You should know that later in 1 Peter,
[406.68 → 407.44] he says to them,
[407.44 → 409.88] Your friends, your old friends, your old neighbours,
[410.16 → 412.04] they're surprised that you don't join them
[412.04 → 414.46] in their reckless, wild living.
[415.46 → 417.32] And they heap abuses on you.
[418.40 → 420.92] The church has learned how to creatively navigate
[420.92 → 422.46] the complexity of the Roman world
[422.46 → 425.46] and find ways to be faithful to Jesus.
[426.20 → 427.10] And that would have been hard.
[427.82 → 429.56] Rome was a place of great power.
[429.64 → 430.28] They loved power.
[430.48 → 431.82] It was a violent society.
[432.10 → 434.70] It was incredibly oversexed.
[435.24 → 437.28] It was incredibly hierarchical.
[437.28 → 439.20] And Christians had to find their way
[439.20 → 440.08] as they followed Jesus
[440.08 → 442.86] to live out their calling in Roman society.
[444.14 → 445.60] I want to read for you a quote.
[445.92 → 447.00] This comes from what's called
[447.00 → 449.02] the Epistle of Igneous.
[449.32 → 450.68] Written in the second century.
[450.96 → 452.20] And we don't know who wrote it,
[452.24 → 453.02] but we know they're a believer.
[453.46 → 455.64] And they're writing it to a person named Igneous
[455.64 → 457.78] to try to explain and help understand
[457.78 → 459.14] how the Christians were living
[459.14 → 460.56] in contrast to their society.
[460.88 → 462.28] And you'll feel as he writes
[462.28 → 464.00] all the contrast he's making.
[464.00 → 465.70] And this is a powerful statement
[465.70 → 467.58] about the church's distinctive life.
[468.24 → 468.66] He writes,
[469.66 → 470.84] they, that is the Christians,
[471.36 → 472.78] they marry as do others.
[473.50 → 474.46] They beget children,
[474.92 → 476.62] but they do not destroy their offspring
[476.62 → 478.44] because that was normal in Rome.
[479.00 → 480.38] They have a common table,
[480.82 → 482.56] but not a common bed,
[482.84 → 484.30] which is also normal in Rome.
[484.92 → 486.20] They are in the flesh,
[486.32 → 488.64] but they do not live after the flesh.
[489.00 → 490.48] They pass their days on earth,
[490.56 → 492.10] but are citizens of heaven.
[492.10 → 495.48] They love all and are persecuted by all.
[496.06 → 496.82] They are poor,
[497.24 → 498.58] yet they make many rich.
[499.00 → 500.46] They are completely destitute,
[500.84 → 502.72] and yet they enjoy complete abundance.
[503.36 → 504.64] They are reviled,
[505.32 → 507.80] and yet they bless.
[509.68 → 512.00] What a statement about the church.
[512.70 → 514.10] You know, my first thought when I read that is,
[514.46 → 516.08] could the same be said of the church today?
[516.54 → 518.56] Could the same set of contrast be made
[518.56 → 519.58] where there's a sense of,
[519.90 → 520.52] oh, they're Christians,
[520.52 → 523.08] they have a distinct lifestyle that sets them apart.
[523.32 → 524.34] They're mocked for it.
[524.54 → 525.72] People revile them for it,
[525.90 → 526.94] and yet these people,
[527.58 → 528.86] they are known for blessing.
[529.42 → 530.80] They are known for hospitality.
[531.28 → 533.18] They are known for sacrificial ways of living
[533.18 → 535.44] that give benefits to other people.
[536.08 → 537.46] What a statement about the church.
[539.02 → 540.22] To join a church then,
[540.28 → 541.78] if I'm reading verse 11 properly,
[542.54 → 544.24] is to join a church that learns
[544.24 → 546.44] to abstain from sinful desires
[546.44 → 548.32] that are normal in culture.
[549.04 → 551.18] To abstain and resist things
[551.18 → 552.30] that are normal around you,
[552.34 → 553.74] but are actually not honouring to God,
[553.82 → 555.56] and certainly not going to lead to life
[555.56 → 557.04] in our own lives and relationships.
[558.10 → 559.50] The church had to creatively learn
[559.50 → 560.68] how to go a different way.
[561.18 → 563.18] A.W. Tower has this great quote
[563.18 → 563.70] where he says,
[563.78 → 563.96] you know,
[564.22 → 565.86] Christians often think of the world
[565.86 → 566.50] as a playground,
[567.50 → 569.28] when in fact it is a battleground.
[570.12 → 571.08] Where Christians learn
[571.08 → 572.60] how to live faithfully to Jesus
[572.60 → 574.28] and follow in his way of life
[574.28 → 576.26] in contrast to all the idols
[576.26 → 578.16] and sinful ways of life
[578.16 → 579.32] that have formed them
[579.32 → 580.32] and surround them
[580.32 → 582.22] in a non-believing society.
[583.78 → 585.14] And if that's true,
[585.66 → 587.40] the same must be true for us today.
[587.68 → 589.00] To join a church today
[589.00 → 590.06] is to join a community
[590.06 → 592.36] that battles against the sinful desires
[592.36 → 594.16] that are normal in our culture.
[594.96 → 596.40] And let me give you just a few examples
[596.40 → 597.18] that I've written down
[597.18 → 599.22] of what this should and could look like
[599.22 → 599.96] for us today.
[600.04 → 600.30] You ready?
[601.38 → 603.20] To join a church today
[603.20 → 605.30] is to join a church
[605.30 → 607.28] that is battling against
[607.28 → 610.20] the deep temptation in the West
[610.20 → 611.50] to make life about
[611.50 → 613.36] the accumulation of wealth
[613.36 → 615.24] and consumer pleasure.
[616.62 → 619.46] That is deep in the bones of our society.
[620.28 → 621.80] To join the church today
[621.80 → 622.88] is to join the community
[622.88 → 624.14] that battles against
[624.14 → 626.66] pursuing only the jobs
[626.66 → 628.44] that make you a lot of money
[628.44 → 630.16] and have prestigious titles.
[631.56 → 633.60] To join the church today
[633.60 → 636.46] is to battle against the desires
[636.46 → 637.80] and the temptations in our culture
[637.80 → 640.24] to make the value of your life
[640.24 → 642.90] only what you present on social media
[642.90 → 644.40] and the meaning
[644.40 → 646.10] and the worth of who you are
[646.10 → 647.40] attached to the likes
[647.40 → 648.78] and the comments below
[648.78 → 650.90] your digital self-presentation.
[652.10 → 653.32] To join the church today
[653.32 → 655.00] is to resist the temptation
[655.00 → 656.54] to reduce the fullness
[656.54 → 657.96] of what it means to be humanity
[657.96 → 662.08] to simply our sexual preferences,
[662.42 → 663.46] our sexual desires,
[663.60 → 665.20] and our sexual experiences.
[666.24 → 668.04] To join the church today
[668.04 → 669.76] is to resist the desire
[669.76 → 671.00] in the academic world
[671.00 → 673.26] to make life all about grades.
[674.26 → 675.64] To determine your value
[675.64 → 677.64] with a letter or a number.
[678.68 → 680.10] These are just a few ways
[680.10 → 681.04] that the church,
[681.24 → 683.00] just like the first century church did,
[683.40 → 685.00] discerns how we are to walk
[685.00 → 686.70] a new way of following Jesus
[686.70 → 688.72] amidst all these sinful desires
[688.72 → 690.20] that are now normal
[690.20 → 690.96] and embedded
[690.96 → 692.80] in the society in which we live.
[693.20 → 694.10] And it's not easy.
[694.98 → 695.98] It's not simple.
[696.56 → 697.86] It's not uncomplicated.
[698.18 → 699.40] But it is the way of Jesus.
[700.28 → 701.38] And as I've said many times
[701.38 → 702.44] behind this pulpit before,
[702.92 → 704.18] to follow the way of Jesus
[704.18 → 706.20] is to say no to many things
[706.20 → 709.02] because they do not lead to life.
[709.02 → 711.02] We do not reduce ourselves
[711.02 → 711.86] in all these ways
[711.86 → 712.68] or chase the grades
[712.68 → 713.40] or chase the money
[713.40 → 714.30] or chase consumerism
[714.30 → 716.48] because it is not life.
[717.30 → 718.04] In fact, I'm guessing
[718.04 → 719.10] there are millions of people
[719.10 → 720.50] around North America right now
[720.50 → 722.00] who are waking up to the reality
[722.00 → 722.84] that all the stuff
[722.84 → 723.56] they got at Christmas
[723.56 → 724.20] and all the stuff
[724.20 → 725.04] they gave at Christmas
[725.04 → 727.50] does not lead to life.
[728.76 → 730.78] It is Christ that brings life.
[731.34 → 731.90] And it is Christ
[731.90 → 732.86] who brings a community
[732.86 → 734.00] away from the idols
[734.00 → 735.68] into the way of His,
[735.92 → 736.68] His own life,
[736.68 → 737.84] so that we can live
[737.84 → 739.10] the fullness of our humanity.
[741.74 → 743.40] Abstain from the sinful desires
[743.40 → 746.12] that war against your soul.
[747.52 → 748.76] If you were to just stop
[748.76 → 749.46] at verse 11,
[749.70 → 750.52] you might think
[750.52 → 751.38] that what Peter is saying
[751.38 → 752.14] to the church is,
[752.46 → 752.86] everybody,
[753.28 → 754.38] retreat from the city.
[754.70 → 756.32] Run away from all the difficulty
[756.32 → 757.00] and the complexity
[757.00 → 758.24] and the idols of that city.
[758.62 → 759.82] Find your own little community.
[760.06 → 761.22] Form your own little church
[761.22 → 762.34] and be segregated
[762.34 → 763.74] from all the cultural life
[763.74 → 764.80] that you were once part of.
[764.80 → 767.30] But then we get to verse 12.
[768.14 → 768.92] And this to me
[768.92 → 770.04] is a real singer,
[770.30 → 770.70] again,
[771.14 → 771.76] for a church
[771.76 → 772.72] that's being persecuted
[772.72 → 773.82] by its culture.
[774.44 → 775.14] Peter writes,
[776.14 → 778.28] live such good lives
[778.28 → 780.24] among the pagans
[780.24 → 781.80] that though they accuse you
[781.80 → 782.46] of doing wrong,
[782.74 → 784.72] they may see your good deeds
[784.72 → 786.12] and glorify God
[786.12 → 787.62] on the day He visits us.
[789.22 → 790.66] I love that verse.
[790.66 → 794.00] That verse opens up powerfully
[794.00 → 795.66] the missionary calling
[795.66 → 796.56] of every church
[796.56 → 798.18] to be among the city.
[799.00 → 799.96] To not run from
[799.96 → 800.92] or retreat from,
[801.10 → 803.28] but to live their ordinary lives
[803.28 → 805.10] scattered throughout the week
[805.10 → 806.36] in the city.
[807.00 → 808.20] Because Jesus' church
[808.20 → 809.78] is, yes, set apart.
[810.00 → 811.24] It has a distinctive lifestyle
[811.24 → 812.52] and yet it lives in
[812.52 → 813.36] and among
[813.36 → 815.32] and for the city.
[815.62 → 816.48] Even a city
[816.48 → 818.40] that persecutes the church.
[818.40 → 818.44] church.
[819.58 → 820.48] That's powerful.
[822.38 → 823.24] You should know
[823.24 → 824.24] that when the early church
[824.24 → 824.88] had to figure out
[824.88 → 825.88] what to call itself,
[826.02 → 827.54] they had several options
[827.54 → 828.10] on the table.
[829.06 → 830.38] The two most common options
[830.38 → 831.40] that the early church had
[831.40 → 833.02] for a self-designation
[833.02 → 834.16] was a Theranos
[834.16 → 835.46] and a thesis.
[835.60 → 835.98] Don't worry about
[835.98 → 836.48] the Greek words.
[836.84 → 838.00] What they basically meant
[838.00 → 839.32] was private,
[839.76 → 840.94] religious community.
[841.90 → 842.74] And there were tons
[842.74 → 843.40] of them around Rome.
[843.46 → 844.42] There's lots of different
[844.42 → 845.48] cults you can be part of.
[845.52 → 846.22] You get in feasts
[846.22 → 847.54] and you sort of sign up
[847.54 → 848.24] and you are known
[848.24 → 849.24] by your affiliation
[849.24 → 849.92] with this private
[849.92 → 850.82] religious community.
[851.18 → 852.04] And the church said,
[852.60 → 853.70] that's not who we are.
[854.38 → 855.14] We are not
[855.14 → 856.52] a private religious community.
[856.78 → 857.68] The name that we're
[857.68 → 858.60] going to pick for ourselves
[858.60 → 860.12] is Silesia.
[860.96 → 861.56] You've probably heard
[861.56 → 862.30] that phrase before.
[862.80 → 863.48] And an Silesia,
[863.68 → 864.34] you know what that means?
[864.46 → 865.52] It sort of pulls together
[865.52 → 866.02] two things.
[866.12 → 866.72] Number one is,
[866.90 → 868.90] it's a public assembly.
[869.66 → 870.32] No hiding.
[870.56 → 871.08] No private.
[871.40 → 872.36] It's a public assembly.
[872.54 → 873.24] And secondly,
[873.54 → 875.06] it's sort of called out
[875.06 → 875.96] for the good of the city.
[875.96 → 876.96] In fact,
[877.02 → 877.72] in the first century,
[877.82 → 878.60] that would be like what
[878.60 → 880.22] people who hold public office,
[880.68 → 881.24] they're an Silesia.
[881.40 → 882.18] They're called out
[882.18 → 883.00] for the good of the city.
[883.12 → 883.84] If only that were the case
[883.84 → 884.66] in politics today.
[885.06 → 885.86] But the church said,
[886.06 → 886.72] we're an Silesia
[886.72 → 887.56] because we are
[887.56 → 888.48] a public community
[888.48 → 889.72] that gathers in public
[889.72 → 891.18] and we are called out
[891.18 → 893.20] for the good of our city.
[893.84 → 895.00] And here's the real singer.
[895.42 → 897.00] By choosing that word,
[897.26 → 898.04] they were persecuted.
[899.34 → 900.02] The Caesar would have
[900.02 → 900.72] no issue
[900.72 → 901.82] with another private
[901.82 → 902.62] religious group
[902.62 → 903.16] going off
[903.16 → 903.96] and doing their own thing
[903.96 → 904.70] on Sunday mornings.
[904.70 → 905.96] What the Caesar did
[905.96 → 906.86] have an issue with
[906.86 → 907.98] is a church that said,
[908.46 → 909.64] we are the new humanity.
[910.06 → 910.92] Jesus is Lord,
[911.04 → 911.62] not the Caesar.
[911.78 → 912.34] And we're inviting
[912.34 → 913.64] the entire world
[913.64 → 914.64] to join us
[914.64 → 916.64] in following the way of life.
[917.36 → 918.60] And they were persecuted
[918.60 → 919.86] for it.
[921.30 → 922.60] Hope Community Church,
[923.56 → 924.50] let's live
[924.50 → 925.52] as an Silesia,
[926.46 → 927.56] not a Theranos,
[928.30 → 929.40] not a Theo sos.
[929.76 → 930.62] We are not
[930.62 → 932.46] a private religious community.
[932.46 → 934.00] Jesus sends us
[934.00 → 935.80] to be distinctive believers
[935.80 → 937.02] who live in
[937.02 → 937.62] and among
[937.62 → 938.56] and for
[938.56 → 940.14] the good of our city.
[941.88 → 942.36] Amen.
[943.98 → 944.86] And I think
[944.86 → 945.94] what really hits me
[945.94 → 946.84] about verse 12,
[946.94 → 947.78] at least one of the things
[947.78 → 948.38] that hits me,
[948.96 → 950.44] is that Peter assumes
[950.44 → 952.98] that God in Christ
[952.98 → 953.98] is going to work
[953.98 → 955.20] His power
[955.20 → 956.44] through the ordinary
[956.44 → 957.48] deeds of believers.
[958.12 → 958.64] And don't think
[958.64 → 959.60] that the first century Christians
[959.60 → 960.58] were some super Christians
[960.58 → 961.52] who had it all figured out.
[961.80 → 962.48] And yet he says,
[962.74 → 964.10] through your ordinary deeds,
[964.20 → 965.46] your actions in the city,
[965.98 → 966.96] your ordinary life,
[967.26 → 968.52] God's going to bring people
[968.52 → 969.42] who are suspicious
[969.42 → 970.06] and skeptical
[970.06 → 970.60] and critical
[970.60 → 971.78] to a place of faith
[971.78 → 973.08] as they watch you.
[973.86 → 974.60] Isn't that powerful?
[975.78 → 976.92] Through their ordinary lives
[976.92 → 977.44] at work,
[977.70 → 978.58] their ordinary lives
[978.58 → 979.16] with their family,
[979.26 → 980.02] their ordinary lives
[980.02 → 980.68] around the city,
[980.86 → 981.98] as they are faithful
[981.98 → 983.44] to Jesus by His Spirit,
[983.80 → 984.72] Jesus will turn
[984.72 → 985.60] people's hearts
[985.60 → 987.34] as they watch believers
[987.34 → 988.38] live their lives.
[989.24 → 990.14] That's powerful.
[991.48 → 992.94] And I would go so far
[992.94 → 993.50] as to suggest
[993.50 → 994.38] that there's many of us
[994.38 → 995.62] in this room this morning
[995.62 → 997.54] who are worshipping here
[997.54 → 998.10] this morning
[998.10 → 999.88] because we saw
[999.88 → 1001.22] the gospel at work
[1001.22 → 1002.34] in the ordinary life
[1002.34 → 1003.18] of someone around us.
[1003.22 → 1004.22] Is that not true for you?
[1005.14 → 1006.04] Throughout your life,
[1006.12 → 1006.70] your childhood,
[1006.90 → 1007.72] your young adult years,
[1007.80 → 1008.46] going to university,
[1008.60 → 1009.46] it's often seeing
[1009.46 → 1010.28] some believer,
[1010.58 → 1011.44] you don't know what to make
[1011.44 → 1011.98] of what they believe,
[1012.04 → 1013.06] but you watch their life
[1013.06 → 1013.48] and you say,
[1013.90 → 1015.64] that is life.
[1016.84 → 1017.96] Perhaps you were in business
[1017.96 → 1019.10] and you saw some Christian
[1019.10 → 1020.14] in your workplace
[1020.14 → 1021.16] and you saw the way
[1021.16 → 1022.32] he treated his employees
[1022.32 → 1023.06] and the way he worked
[1023.06 → 1023.58] with his money
[1023.58 → 1024.14] and you thought,
[1024.48 → 1025.36] this isn't the cutthroat
[1025.36 → 1026.08] world of business.
[1026.32 → 1027.10] This guy lives
[1027.10 → 1028.08] for a different reason.
[1029.26 → 1030.32] Perhaps you've got a neighbour
[1030.32 → 1031.26] who is a Christian.
[1031.38 → 1031.88] You see the way
[1031.88 → 1032.66] she and her husband
[1032.66 → 1033.58] are raising their kids
[1033.58 → 1034.26] and the way they live
[1034.26 → 1034.76] in their marriage
[1034.76 → 1035.72] and you have no idea
[1035.72 → 1036.50] what to make of the gospel,
[1036.64 → 1037.58] but you see life
[1037.58 → 1038.98] in that home
[1038.98 → 1040.06] and it compels you.
[1040.96 → 1041.94] Perhaps you're a student
[1041.94 → 1043.12] and you don't know anything
[1043.12 → 1043.64] about Christianity,
[1043.78 → 1044.54] but there's this girl
[1044.54 → 1045.66] next to you in class
[1045.66 → 1046.62] and she doesn't seem
[1046.62 → 1047.78] to be so lured
[1047.78 → 1049.26] by the power of grades
[1049.26 → 1050.90] or the power
[1050.90 → 1051.48] of just getting
[1051.48 → 1052.74] that distinguished job
[1052.74 → 1053.18] at the end.
[1053.26 → 1053.84] She's studying
[1053.84 → 1055.02] so she can use her gifts
[1055.02 → 1056.08] to serve.
[1057.28 → 1059.58] In all these ordinary ways,
[1060.34 → 1061.18] Jesus Christ,
[1061.30 → 1062.42] by the power of the Spirit,
[1062.58 → 1063.38] turns hearts,
[1064.14 → 1065.10] softens people,
[1065.52 → 1066.88] moving them from skepticism
[1066.88 → 1067.44] to faith,
[1067.62 → 1070.02] such that when Jesus returns
[1070.02 → 1070.80] in glory and power,
[1071.02 → 1071.76] they're not skeptical,
[1071.76 → 1072.90] they're worshipping
[1072.90 → 1074.92] through the ordinary ministry
[1074.92 → 1076.20] of the church.
[1078.60 → 1079.88] Can I just invite you
[1079.88 → 1080.64] to pause
[1080.64 → 1082.76] and think about the people
[1082.76 → 1083.62] in your own life,
[1084.48 → 1085.30] your neighbours,
[1086.06 → 1087.00] your coworkers,
[1087.26 → 1088.50] the people you rub shoulders
[1088.50 → 1089.58] with at Tim Hortons
[1089.58 → 1090.42] in the classroom
[1090.42 → 1091.48] or Starbucks
[1091.48 → 1092.68] if you're classy like that.
[1093.72 → 1094.78] This is the mission
[1094.78 → 1095.44] of the church,
[1096.28 → 1097.78] the Monday to Saturday
[1097.78 → 1099.32] ordinary warp and woof
[1099.32 → 1100.88] of life to do deeds
[1100.88 → 1103.14] that show we follow Jesus.
[1104.18 → 1105.30] And I don't think
[1105.30 → 1106.58] it's that complicated
[1106.58 → 1108.14] because what the world
[1108.14 → 1109.16] really needs to see
[1109.16 → 1110.68] is that the person of Jesus
[1110.68 → 1111.70] we come to gather
[1111.70 → 1112.68] and worship on Sunday
[1112.68 → 1114.38] shapes the way we love
[1114.38 → 1116.42] and live in the city,
[1117.10 → 1117.80] in our workplace,
[1118.34 → 1119.12] in the classroom,
[1119.56 → 1120.32] with our neighbours,
[1120.80 → 1121.70] in our homes.
[1122.18 → 1123.50] And the same Spirit of God
[1123.50 → 1124.70] that's present with us
[1124.70 → 1125.26] this morning
[1125.26 → 1126.64] goes with us
[1126.64 → 1127.38] as we gather
[1127.38 → 1128.62] and scatter throughout the city
[1128.62 → 1130.32] to do all the ordinary tasks
[1130.32 → 1130.98] of life.
[1132.26 → 1133.06] And that same Spirit
[1133.06 → 1134.38] softens hearts of people
[1134.38 → 1136.10] who are watching you.
[1136.16 → 1136.76] And trust me,
[1136.94 → 1138.34] there's a very good chance
[1138.34 → 1139.74] there are a lot of people
[1139.74 → 1141.22] who are watching you.
[1141.98 → 1142.76] They're not necessarily
[1142.76 → 1143.86] interested in what you have to say,
[1144.22 → 1145.18] but they do want to know
[1145.18 → 1146.56] is what you do
[1146.56 → 1148.38] consistent with what you believe
[1148.38 → 1149.34] about Jesus Christ
[1149.34 → 1150.28] and how you worship
[1150.28 → 1151.06] on Sunday morning.
[1151.06 → 1154.04] And don't ever underestimate
[1154.04 → 1157.00] the power of Jesus Christ
[1157.00 → 1160.40] to use your ordinary small life
[1160.40 → 1163.16] to make someone come to faith in Christ.
[1163.66 → 1165.74] The gospel has power.
[1166.94 → 1168.54] And Jesus can do so much
[1168.54 → 1169.82] with so little.
[1170.54 → 1172.06] He has so much ability
[1172.06 → 1174.26] with our ordinary lives.
[1174.96 → 1176.10] Test me on that one.
[1176.90 → 1177.94] Try out this week
[1177.94 → 1179.30] living faithfully
[1179.30 → 1180.04] with the things
[1180.04 → 1180.70] and the places
[1180.70 → 1181.60] that God puts you
[1181.60 → 1183.62] and see what He can do
[1183.62 → 1184.60] in and through
[1184.60 → 1185.76] our ordinary lives.
[1187.78 → 1188.76] Verse 11 tells us
[1188.76 → 1189.60] that we are a community
[1189.60 → 1190.76] that must be at war
[1190.76 → 1192.02] against the sinful desires
[1192.02 → 1193.38] that dehumanize us
[1193.38 → 1194.84] and bring us far
[1194.84 → 1195.40] from the life
[1195.40 → 1196.34] that we are created for.
[1196.80 → 1197.72] Verse 12 says,
[1198.20 → 1198.58] Church,
[1199.00 → 1199.90] you must be in
[1199.90 → 1201.28] and for the city.
[1201.62 → 1203.44] They must see deeds
[1203.44 → 1204.72] that reflect
[1204.72 → 1206.14] the love of Jesus Christ.
[1206.84 → 1208.06] And don't be surprised
[1208.06 → 1209.74] if by seeing them
[1209.74 → 1211.10] they are wooed
[1211.10 → 1212.82] to Jesus Himself
[1212.82 → 1214.28] such that
[1214.28 → 1215.52] when Jesus comes back
[1215.52 → 1216.84] they are not critical
[1216.84 → 1218.48] but they join us
[1218.48 → 1219.12] in worship.
[1220.38 → 1221.48] May it be so.
[1222.60 → 1223.72] Let me lead us in prayer.
[1230.18 → 1231.30] Father, I want to begin
[1231.30 → 1232.00] with gratitude
[1232.00 → 1233.80] that we're here
[1233.80 → 1235.22] because You have done something
[1235.22 → 1236.28] in our lives
[1236.28 → 1238.88] and You've used the words
[1238.88 → 1239.78] and the deeds
[1239.78 → 1241.12] of people in our life
[1241.12 → 1242.86] to nurture our faith.
[1242.96 → 1243.64] We praise You
[1243.64 → 1245.18] that we are Your children
[1245.18 → 1246.72] and that You've found us.
[1247.94 → 1248.98] Lord, we ask that You
[1248.98 → 1249.80] would use us
[1249.80 → 1250.66] as an ecclesial,
[1251.70 → 1253.32] that You would send us
[1253.32 → 1254.34] into our cities
[1254.34 → 1255.96] and that in our very
[1255.96 → 1257.06] ordinary lives,
[1257.16 → 1258.46] our very broken lives,
[1258.86 → 1259.84] the good news of Jesus
[1259.84 → 1261.66] would shine through
[1261.66 → 1263.82] our ordinary acts
[1263.82 → 1264.42] of love,
[1265.20 → 1266.46] our ordinary kindness
[1266.46 → 1267.50] to those on the margins,
[1268.30 → 1269.44] our thoughtfulness
[1269.44 → 1270.18] to our coworkers
[1270.18 → 1271.10] and classmates.
[1272.04 → 1272.54] Lord, would You
[1272.54 → 1274.16] fill us with Your Spirit
[1274.16 → 1275.50] such that the light
[1275.50 → 1276.76] of Jesus shines brightly
[1276.76 → 1277.56] in the darkness
[1277.56 → 1278.84] of this city.
[1279.50 → 1280.24] And would You be
[1280.24 → 1281.42] so kind to us
[1281.42 → 1283.22] to bring many people
[1283.22 → 1283.82] in Clayton
[1283.82 → 1284.62] and Coverdale
[1284.62 → 1285.26] and beyond
[1285.26 → 1286.72] to know You
[1286.72 → 1287.68] through the ministry
[1287.68 → 1289.00] of Hope Community Church.
[1289.00 → 1290.72] We trust You,
[1291.30 → 1292.08] we believe
[1292.08 → 1292.66] that the gospel
[1292.66 → 1293.42] has power,
[1293.80 → 1294.68] and we invite You
[1294.68 → 1296.18] to use us.
[1296.96 → 1297.22] Amen.
[1302.10 → 1303.00] At this time,
[1303.06 → 1303.94] we're going to celebrate
[1303.94 → 1305.24] communion together,
[1305.62 → 1306.56] and hopefully someone
[1306.56 → 1307.38] has gone upstairs
[1307.38 → 1308.18] to invite our children
[1308.18 → 1309.44] to join us for it.
