[0.00 → 10.12] Well, as it was announced at the beginning of the service, we get to celebrate Caden's
[10.12 → 11.60] baptism together this morning.
[12.54 → 17.02] And before I even begin, it's kind of cool that we get to be nervous about this together,
[17.02 → 21.48] how this is my first baptism and this is Caden's first baptism.
[23.60 → 24.90] I'm hoping that's true.
[24.90 → 30.40] And so this morning, we witnessed the baptism of Caden Lünen.
[30.92 → 36.36] We are thankful that you are here to celebrate this milestone, this work of grace in Caden's
[36.36 → 36.66] life.
[37.58 → 42.50] And since the time I've met Caden, we've been talking about baptism, being baptized, and
[42.50 → 46.62] he has been very much eagerly waiting for this for a long time.
[47.44 → 53.92] There was the issue of me being ordained and being equipped to administer the baptism, to
[53.92 → 55.68] share this milestone with my brother of faith.
[56.82 → 61.26] And so in our generation and culture, it's kind of unique and maybe challenging a little
[61.26 → 66.26] bit more where it's not so easy or maybe not even normal to be a Christian.
[67.10 → 69.76] But we are called to share the good news of Jesus.
[70.32 → 75.02] We are called to take hold of the faith that you have been given, to embrace the good news
[75.02 → 79.96] and live as a follower of Jesus Christ and live as part of his family.
[79.96 → 83.82] That is what is happening here for Caden this morning.
[84.54 → 90.58] And ordinarily at Hope, we baptize infants and later as they grow in their faith, we invite
[90.58 → 92.28] them to do their profession of faith.
[92.96 → 99.54] But because Caden is new to this faith, to our faith, and have not received baptism yet,
[99.74 → 101.44] we're merging those two together.
[102.22 → 104.70] And so let me share a few words about the meaning of baptism.
[104.70 → 108.72] Baptism is fundamentally about belonging.
[109.60 → 113.82] It is about being grafted into the family of faith, the body of Christ.
[114.64 → 119.32] And a couple of weeks ago, even during my ordination service, Pastor Dave invited us to reflect
[119.32 → 128.04] on the marvellous fact that the church, including ours, it still exists about 2,000 years after
[128.04 → 129.46] the death and resurrection of Jesus.
[129.46 → 136.54] And this reality, as Scripture tells us, is because of the resurrection power of Christ.
[136.98 → 143.84] And this is the same power that is called and adopted Caden into God's family.
[144.66 → 150.52] And as part of this family, he will grow to know and experience the love of God, the grace
[150.52 → 152.80] of Jesus, and the life of the Spirit.
[153.60 → 156.50] And so we get to hear a little bit of that in Caden's testimony today.
[156.50 → 164.52] We believe that baptism is a sign of sins being washed away and of being united with Christ's
[164.52 → 165.40] death and resurrection.
[166.24 → 171.80] That's why when we do an adult baptism, as is the case today, we often submerge people in
[171.80 → 175.92] the water, which is a symbol of dying and rising to new life.
[176.12 → 183.26] We die to our old self, and we are resurrected with the new self, made alive by Christ, not by
[183.26 → 184.80] us, but by His grace.
[184.80 → 192.16] And so we believe that baptism is a seal, wherein God makes possible the life of faith in the
[192.16 → 193.82] life of the person being baptized.
[195.04 → 201.22] All true Christians see baptism as a mark by which God claims a person and calls to live
[201.22 → 203.40] in faith, love, and obedience.
[204.74 → 209.10] And so we recognize that baptism is not simply an offer to come to faith.
[209.10 → 215.72] It is also not a guarantee that a person will automatically just believe because they
[215.72 → 216.24] get baptized.
[217.02 → 218.26] It is a promise.
[218.52 → 224.16] It is a covenant that as a person grows up in this family of faith, the Spirit will be
[224.16 → 224.78] at work.
[226.54 → 232.86] The Spirit will enable Caden to take hold of Christ in faith and experience the life that
[232.86 → 238.04] is truly life, what it means to be truly human, made in God's image.
[238.40 → 240.40] And we reflected this together at Surge Caden.
[240.64 → 243.60] We get to become who we already are.
[243.60 → 250.74] And so hear these words from Romans 6, as Paul tells us the meaning of baptism in his words.
[251.16 → 258.78] We were buried with Him through baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised
[258.78 → 263.60] from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may have new life.
[263.60 → 269.68] For we have been united with Him in a death like His, we will certainly also be united with
[269.68 → 272.04] Him in a resurrection like His.
[272.90 → 278.90] For we know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body ruled by sin might
[278.90 → 280.14] be done away with.
[280.94 → 286.96] That we should no longer be slaves to sin because anyone who has died has been set free from
[286.96 → 287.52] sin.
[288.26 → 290.90] And so Caden, I'm going to ask you up to the stage at this time.
[293.60 → 297.18] Yeah, I think you can grab the mic at this point.
[297.38 → 297.50] Yeah.
[298.76 → 304.54] Before you share your testimony, I'm going to ask you some questions for you to answer.
[309.04 → 313.34] First, Caden, after I ask all the questions, I'm going to ask you to answer with the appropriate
[313.34 → 313.76] answer.
[315.22 → 320.24] First, do you love Jesus Christ and do you want to make following Him the goal of the rest
[320.24 → 320.86] of your life?
[320.86 → 327.02] Second, do you confess that you are a sinner, that you are broken and that you need grace,
[327.10 → 330.18] which only comes through the death and resurrection of Jesus?
[331.32 → 338.72] Third, will you commit to growing in the faith, in this community of faith, and foster the practices
[338.72 → 343.98] that lead to vitality in your Christian walk, to devote yourself to the church's teaching,
[344.50 → 346.78] fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayers?
[346.78 → 353.44] And lastly, are you committed to using your gifts in service for the kingdom, joining us
[353.44 → 360.12] in bearing witness to the love of Christ with your talents, your time, your ambitions, lots
[360.12 → 362.92] of ambition from you, Caden, the whole of your life?
[363.66 → 365.12] I do, God helping me.
[365.76 → 366.10] Amen.
[366.10 → 371.14] I'm going to ask the congregation to stand at this point and respond to this question
[371.14 → 371.58] as well.
[375.50 → 381.16] Do you, church, receive Caden as a member of this body of believers, and do you promise
[381.16 → 386.58] to love him, pray for him, do life with him, and encourage him in his walk with the Lord
[386.58 → 387.62] as you are able?
[387.88 → 389.14] Church, what is your answer?
[389.56 → 391.56] Do you, God helping me.
[391.56 → 398.26] I'm going to ask you to stay standing as we're going to confess one of the oldest confessions
[398.26 → 399.28] of our faith together.
[400.28 → 405.44] And so in the early church, before people even received baptism, they underwent catechism,
[405.64 → 406.00] teaching.
[406.60 → 411.58] A pastor would teach them what it looked like to follow Jesus and the content of the Christian
[411.58 → 414.44] faith, which Caden will express through his testimony.
[415.32 → 419.90] Before people received baptism in the early church, they would recite what we're going to
[419.90 → 421.84] recite together, the Apostles' Creed.
[423.26 → 429.06] This creed is one of the few documents that unites Christians throughout history and throughout
[429.06 → 430.22] the world, even today.
[430.84 → 436.22] We're going to read it together, and as we read it, Caden and church, I want to remind
[436.22 → 441.12] us that these words are the actual words that many Christians even died for.
[441.96 → 444.22] Words that marked them off from their culture.
[444.22 → 450.10] Words that reflected lives that now belong to the kingdom of Jesus Christ.
[450.82 → 455.68] And so, with the Church of Ages, let us confess these words together, which will be up on the
[455.68 → 456.26] screen for you.
[458.58 → 464.02] I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[464.02 → 472.12] I believe in Jesus Christ, his Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born
[472.12 → 473.12] of the Virgin Mary.
[474.12 → 479.18] He suffered under a conscious delight, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[479.86 → 481.02] He descended to heaven.
[481.02 → 484.44] The third day he rose again from the dead.
[485.02 → 486.18] He ascended to heaven.
[486.76 → 490.14] And is seated at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty.
[490.96 → 494.14] From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[495.10 → 502.26] I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness
[502.26 → 507.16] of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life of the last one.
[507.86 → 508.22] Amen.
[508.22 → 508.44] Amen.
[509.04 → 509.32] Amen.
[509.32 → 509.50] Amen.
[510.14 → 510.50] Amen.
[518.82 → 519.34] Amen.
[519.34 → 519.46] Amen.
[519.46 → 519.96] Amen.
[519.96 → 521.64] Prepare- to me.
[521.76 → 522.30] Do you want your towel?
[523.18 → 523.90] No, that's fine.
[530.36 → 534.86] So, on the first service, Jonathan asked me to be a little louder, which is the first
[534.86 → 538.14] time I've ever heard that in my life, which is like, so it's an exciting day.
[538.14 → 545.66] all around. But yeah, good morning Hope. I just want to start by saying thank you to everyone
[545.66 → 554.50] that came to share such a special day with me. First came to Hope on May 3rd, 2023. I'd like to
[554.50 → 559.58] say on that day God found me because I wasn't looking. I wasn't raised religious so my experiences
[559.58 → 566.54] with God and the church were very limited. Leading up to this new journey, I was having a pretty rough
[566.54 → 570.96] go with life. About three and a half years ago I suffered a traumatic brain injury which led to a
[570.96 → 578.66] lot of physical and mental struggles that I wasn't equipped to deal with. The year leading up to me
[578.66 → 582.86] coming to faith is where things got very difficult. Without getting into too much detail, through
[582.86 → 587.86] brokenness and struggles within my family, I was forced to experience firsthand the effects of sin.
[587.86 → 597.26] As situations progressed, things became too much to bear. I felt lost, angry, confused and depressed.
[597.26 → 602.30] Not knowing what my next step was, I truly felt the weight of the world on my shoulders.
[602.30 → 611.10] I tried my best to keep moving forward and pull myself out of the turmoil I was feeling, but I failed.
[611.10 → 624.86] I reached my boiling point on May 3rd, 2023 and was truly ready to give up and end it all. I remember driving
[624.86 → 630.52] around through Clayton Heights with no destination, broken and lost. Knowing what this would do to my
[630.52 → 638.34] family, but lacking a better plan. As I was driving down 68th Avenue, I saw Hope. Without thinking, I pulled in.
[638.34 → 646.38] Sitting there confused on why I just pulled into a church parking lot, I left. I drove up to the second roundabout
[646.38 → 654.42] and I came right back. Sat in my truck for about 10 minutes and once again left. Finally, on the third
[654.42 → 662.16] time, God wasn't taking no for an answer. I returned with an overwhelming urge to come inside. While not
[662.16 → 673.84] knowing how any of this works, I made a phone call to the front desk. Natalia answered the phone and told me
[673.84 → 681.50] to come right in. I was greeted by Val. I was greeted by Val who then brought me to the foot of the cross
[681.50 → 687.82] and we prayed. She then shared with me a story from the Bible, which seemed to be exactly what I needed
[687.82 → 694.66] to hear. We sat there for probably about two hours chatting, reading and praying. For the first time
[694.66 → 699.96] in a while, I started to feel a sense of peace. When it was time to leave, Val set me up with my first
[699.96 → 703.70] Bible and for the remainder of that evening, I was glued to that book.
[703.70 → 712.18] The following morning, I woke up once again lost, not knowing what my next step was. So I got in my
[712.18 → 720.08] truck and drove back to Hope. I continued doing this every day for about a month. I'd spend two,
[720.24 → 725.68] three, four hours, two, three, four hours sitting at the foot of the cross, reading, praying and
[725.68 → 732.26] developing my faith. In the beginning, Hope was a safe place where I know I could find God. As time went
[732.26 → 736.82] on, I began to learn how to walk with God in my day-to-day life, and he made himself known to me
[736.82 → 742.02] every single day. Things started to happen that I couldn't explain other than it being the work of
[742.02 → 748.82] God. My mental health started to become much more manageable. I no longer felt entirely consumed by
[748.82 → 756.14] my problems. Through the grace of God, I no longer have to be alone. I want to express my deepest gratitude
[756.14 → 763.50] to Val and Jonathan for playing such an instrumental role in my faith and really taking the time
[763.50 → 768.96] with me, teaching me how to pray, read the Bible and become a member of this community.
[771.76 → 777.06] I also want to thank all the members of our Men's Breakfast, Young Adults and Serge for continuing
[777.06 → 783.50] to teach and walk with me as we try to be more like Jesus. And thank you to all of our church members
[783.50 → 787.84] and everyone that carries the word of God and makes Hope a community I'm proud to be a part of.
[788.78 → 792.44] Though I have much to learn, I feel as though I'm becoming who I was always meant to be,
[792.64 → 795.64] and I know I'm exactly where God wants me to be.
[795.64 → 797.64] Thank you.
[813.50 → 827.04] I'm going to ask Val to join us up here. Machine
[827.06 → 827.76] ?
[827.76 → 830.44] Oh, cow.
[832.70 → 834.16] Oh, oh, it's right.
[835.16 → 837.20] Oh, other way, other way.
[839.64 → 840.72] Sit, sit, lay up.
[843.78 → 844.66] Temperature, okay?
[846.18 → 846.70] A little tight.
[848.22 → 853.08] We're not used to such a big man doing bad discipline.
[854.08 → 856.18] I'm going to hold my hand as we go down, okay?
[857.76 → 863.76] Let's get these words out.
[873.56 → 875.14] I baptize you.
[875.14 → 875.20] Amen.
[880.40 → 884.98] In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[888.48 → 888.88] Thank you.
[891.16 → 893.26] A final gesture.
[893.26 → 895.28] A final gesture.
[895.36 → 895.54] versions.
[895.60 → 897.74] A final gesture.
[901.06 → 901.56] A final gesture.
[901.56 → 905.36] Just ask, I'm going to ask,
[905.36 → 922.36] I'm going to ask friends and family to come up and join us as we lay hands on Caden to
[922.36 → 925.96] pray for him as we continue this journey together now.
[925.96 → 930.74] So if you would like to come up, lay hands on him, I ask you to come up to the stage
[930.74 → 932.74] now, please.
[932.74 → 956.46] Let's move this whole thing to the centre over there.
[956.46 → 961.12] I'm going to ask Val to lead us in praying for Caden and if anybody would like to pray for
[961.12 → 968.12] them, just ask for the mic, raise your hand, we'll pass it to you, and we'll pray for Caden.
[968.12 → 975.12] Please join me in praying.
[975.12 → 988.12] Please join me in praying.
[988.12 → 999.12] God, you have led Caden to this moment, and we're so grateful for the way that you put
[999.12 → 1009.12] little tiny details and weave threads of gold through our lives to bring us to be who we
[1009.12 → 1010.12] are meant to be.
[1010.12 → 1016.40] God, I just pray your blessing on Caden and his whole family at this moment as you symbolize
[1016.40 → 1019.12] new life, new possibilities.
[1019.12 → 1029.12] Your Holy Spirit breathing and working through us to bring life from death, to bring grace
[1029.12 → 1030.12] grace and goodness.
[1030.12 → 1040.12] God, we just pray that you infuse Caden with everything that he needs from this part of his
[1040.12 → 1041.12] journey forward.
[1041.12 → 1048.62] That you would use this young man and his commitment, witness today, that you would further your kingdom
[1048.62 → 1055.62] through him and all his ambitions and all his plans that they would be within your mighty,
[1055.62 → 1061.62] loving, compassionate hands.
[1061.62 → 1075.62] Father, we praise you for new life.
[1075.62 → 1081.90] We praise you for the trust he has in your word and the way he's willing to serve with
[1081.90 → 1082.90] his gifts.
[1082.90 → 1090.18] And we just pray your blessing over his future, that you grow him in faith and wisdom and use
[1090.18 → 1095.18] his gifts to bless many people.
[1095.18 → 1112.18] Father God, we thank you once again for your son that you have called into this family.
[1112.18 → 1119.18] Lord, continue to guide us now through your spirit as we live into the being, into the
[1119.18 → 1124.18] new life that you have already called us to.
[1124.18 → 1128.46] And so we bless Caden with this blessing that comes from Hebrews.
[1128.46 → 1134.46] Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the
[1134.46 → 1141.46] dead, our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, may that God equip you with everything
[1141.46 → 1146.46] good, everything good for doing his will.
[1146.46 → 1151.46] And may he work in us what is pleasing to him through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be
[1151.46 → 1152.46] glory forever and ever.
[1152.46 → 1153.46] Amen.
[1153.46 → 1154.46] Amen.
[1154.46 → 1158.46] Hope will you join me in welcoming our newest member of our faith.
[1158.46 → 1159.46] I'd like to dismiss the kids.
[1159.46 → 1160.46] They're welcome to go upstairs.
[1160.46 → 1161.46] And I would like to dismiss the kids.
[1161.46 → 1162.46] They're welcome to go upstairs.
[1162.46 → 1163.46] And I would like to dismiss the kids.
[1163.46 → 1164.46] They're welcome to go upstairs to Cornerstone.
[1164.46 → 1170.46] And there's also launch ages three to grade three.
[1170.46 → 1183.46] A5C for me.
[1183.46 → 1186.98] A5C for me.
[1186.98 → 1189.72] They're welcome to go upstairs to Cornerstone,
[1189.72 → 1193.10] and there's also launch, ages three to grade three.
[1209.22 → 1213.86] It's my privilege this morning to pray with you today.
[1213.86 → 1216.72] And after the service, if anybody would like to have prayer,
[1216.72 → 1217.92] I'll be over there in the corner,
[1218.74 → 1221.48] and I will be happy to pray with you.
[1222.28 → 1223.64] Will you join me now?
[1225.34 → 1228.70] Father in heaven, we come before you this morning
[1228.70 → 1230.16] in this rhythm of Sabbath,
[1230.90 → 1232.92] longing to be refreshed and restored.
[1233.74 → 1237.12] We know, Father, you are the only one who can do this for us.
[1237.94 → 1240.98] You are our Father, our faithful Father,
[1241.22 → 1243.54] our Saviour, our Rock.
[1244.24 → 1246.46] We remind ourselves like the psalmist,
[1246.72 → 1249.00] the Lord is gracious and righteous.
[1249.72 → 1251.76] Our God is full of compassion.
[1252.72 → 1254.78] The Lord protects the simple-hearted.
[1255.88 → 1257.96] When I was in great need, he saved me.
[1258.90 → 1260.86] Be at rest once more, O my soul,
[1260.96 → 1262.78] for the Lord has been good to you.
[1263.88 → 1265.92] Lord, how can we ever thank you
[1265.92 → 1267.26] for all you have done for us?
[1267.80 → 1269.04] We are so grateful.
[1269.04 → 1272.60] Thank you for the testimony of Caden.
[1273.24 → 1275.22] You have touched this young man deeply,
[1275.22 → 1278.12] and we get to witness his commitment to you this morning
[1278.12 → 1280.02] through his testimony in baptism.
[1280.88 → 1282.94] May you be glorified in his life,
[1283.32 → 1285.44] and may the calling on his life
[1285.44 → 1288.40] to serve you deep in each day
[1288.40 → 1291.32] through prayer, community, and your word.
[1292.44 → 1294.90] Thank you, Lord, for the good news of Sarah Choi.
[1295.66 → 1298.00] Thank you that her breast cancer surgery
[1298.00 → 1299.32] has shown no more cancer.
[1300.28 → 1302.74] Please continue to strengthen her to full health,
[1302.74 → 1305.44] and let her return home soon to her family.
[1306.64 → 1308.94] And Lord, continue to strengthen Tyler Dealer
[1308.94 → 1310.12] at GF Strong
[1310.12 → 1313.24] as he works to be able to come home next month.
[1314.00 → 1316.18] We ask, Father, for your mercy.
[1317.36 → 1319.94] Continue to heal him in all areas of his life.
[1320.86 → 1322.42] Give those who are supporting him
[1322.42 → 1323.88] your guidance and strength
[1323.88 → 1325.20] as they journey with Tyler.
[1326.74 → 1329.62] Father, we come asking humbly
[1329.62 → 1331.62] for your strength in so many areas.
[1332.56 → 1334.70] There are some of us who have physical,
[1335.78 → 1338.36] spiritual, or emotional pain.
[1339.34 → 1341.38] We know of family and friends
[1341.38 → 1342.50] that are hurting deeply
[1342.50 → 1344.74] for a variety of reasons,
[1344.74 → 1347.00] and we lift these loved ones up to you
[1347.00 → 1348.66] for your touch of healing.
[1350.60 → 1352.08] And Lord, we see this world
[1352.08 → 1355.68] and the devastation of war on so many.
[1356.94 → 1358.28] We ask you, please,
[1358.28 → 1360.16] may your kingdom come,
[1361.22 → 1363.12] and may your will be done on earth
[1363.12 → 1364.36] as it is in heaven.
[1365.90 → 1367.76] Father, we ask you to bless Dave
[1367.76 → 1369.08] as he gives us the words
[1369.08 → 1371.32] that you have given him to share with us.
[1372.32 → 1374.00] Take distractions away
[1374.00 → 1376.72] so that in this hour we are together,
[1377.18 → 1379.18] we truly worship you,
[1380.10 → 1381.34] our faithful redeemer.
[1382.64 → 1383.98] Bless the children upstairs
[1383.98 → 1387.32] as the teachers share with them who you are,
[1387.32 → 1390.20] let it take root in their hearts
[1390.20 → 1393.40] so they grow into followers of a God
[1393.40 → 1395.08] who just adores them.
[1395.86 → 1397.02] In the name of the Father,
[1397.52 → 1398.76] the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[1399.14 → 1399.44] Amen.
[1399.44 → 1399.60] Amen.
[1399.60 → 1415.10] Well, good morning, everyone,
[1415.86 → 1417.54] and welcome to the friends and family
[1417.54 → 1418.66] who are here for the baptism.
[1420.02 → 1421.76] We're in the middle of a sermon series
[1421.76 → 1422.60] on the book of Ruth,
[1422.70 → 1425.38] this tiny little Old Testament love story,
[1425.38 → 1428.02] and if you weren't here last week,
[1428.08 → 1428.98] we looked about the way
[1428.98 → 1429.78] and looked at how
[1429.78 → 1432.28] God is sovereignly orchestrating his plans
[1432.28 → 1434.04] through ordinary events
[1434.04 → 1435.66] to bring healing to a broken family
[1435.66 → 1437.36] and healing to a broken nation.
[1438.06 → 1438.72] And this morning,
[1438.78 → 1439.38] we're going to pick up
[1439.38 → 1440.46] right where we left off
[1440.46 → 1441.38] in Ruth chapter 2.
[1441.48 → 1442.32] So if you have your Bible,
[1442.58 → 1443.92] turn with me to Ruth chapter 2,
[1444.00 → 1444.74] or if you have your phone,
[1444.94 → 1446.38] scroll with me to Ruth chapter 2.
[1446.74 → 1448.00] And if you don't have your phone,
[1448.06 → 1449.00] which is hard to believe,
[1449.36 → 1450.32] the words are on the screen.
[1450.32 → 1453.10] I'm going to read the first nine verses
[1453.10 → 1454.32] and then jump down to 17.
[1456.42 → 1457.84] Now Naomi had a relative
[1457.84 → 1459.12] on her husband's side,
[1459.64 → 1460.54] a man of standing
[1460.54 → 1461.76] from the clan of Abimelech,
[1461.82 → 1462.90] whose name was Boaz.
[1463.78 → 1465.46] And Ruth the Mobile said to Naomi,
[1465.74 → 1466.52] let me go to the fields
[1466.52 → 1467.88] and pick up the leftover grain
[1467.88 → 1468.60] behind anyone
[1468.60 → 1470.24] in whose eyes I find favour.
[1471.44 → 1472.26] Naomi said to her,
[1472.32 → 1473.20] go ahead, my daughter.
[1473.76 → 1474.50] So she went out,
[1474.58 → 1475.18] entered the field,
[1475.22 → 1476.06] and began to glean
[1476.06 → 1477.16] behind the harvesters.
[1477.80 → 1478.82] As it turned out,
[1478.82 → 1480.08] she found herself working
[1480.08 → 1481.76] in the field belonging to Boaz,
[1482.06 → 1483.52] who was from the clan of Abimelech.
[1484.34 → 1485.76] Just then Boaz arrived
[1485.76 → 1486.36] from Bethlehem
[1486.36 → 1487.42] and greeted the harvesters.
[1487.94 → 1489.00] The Lord be with you.
[1489.60 → 1490.74] The Lord bless you,
[1490.82 → 1491.36] they answered.
[1492.46 → 1493.86] Boaz asked the overseer
[1493.86 → 1494.74] of his harvesters,
[1494.96 → 1496.94] who does that young woman belong to?
[1497.74 → 1498.98] The overseer replied,
[1499.08 → 1500.02] she is a Mobile woman
[1500.02 → 1501.18] who came back from Moab
[1501.18 → 1501.78] with Naomi.
[1502.44 → 1502.84] She said,
[1502.90 → 1503.72] please let me glean
[1503.72 → 1504.84] and gather sheaves
[1504.84 → 1505.88] behind the harvesters.
[1506.48 → 1507.56] She came into the fields
[1507.56 → 1508.52] and has remained here
[1508.52 → 1509.56] from morning till now,
[1509.56 → 1510.90] except for a short rest
[1510.90 → 1511.44] in the shelter.
[1512.58 → 1513.78] So Boaz said to Ruth,
[1514.24 → 1514.76] my daughter,
[1514.90 → 1515.58] listen to me.
[1516.16 → 1517.12] Don't go and glean
[1517.12 → 1517.90] in another field
[1517.90 → 1519.28] and don't go away from here.
[1519.90 → 1520.96] Stay here with the women
[1520.96 → 1521.82] who work for me.
[1522.28 → 1523.04] Watch the field
[1523.04 → 1524.42] where the harvesters
[1524.42 → 1524.82] are working
[1524.82 → 1525.64] and follow along
[1525.64 → 1526.24] after the women.
[1526.90 → 1527.64] I have told the men
[1527.64 → 1528.92] not to lay a hand on you
[1528.92 → 1530.32] and whenever you are thirsty,
[1530.80 → 1531.56] go and get a drink
[1531.56 → 1532.44] from the water jars
[1532.44 → 1533.22] the men have filled.
[1534.82 → 1535.96] So Ruth gleaned
[1535.96 → 1536.38] in the field
[1536.38 → 1537.00] until evening.
[1537.00 → 1538.36] Then she thrust
[1538.36 → 1539.52] the barley she had gathered
[1539.52 → 1540.58] and it amounted to
[1540.58 → 1541.14] in epoch.
[1541.78 → 1542.54] She carried it back
[1542.54 → 1543.06] to town
[1543.06 → 1543.96] and her mother-in-law
[1543.96 → 1545.74] how much she had gathered.
[1546.56 → 1547.58] Ruth also brought out
[1547.58 → 1548.06] and gave her
[1548.06 → 1548.88] what she had left over
[1548.88 → 1550.10] after she had eaten enough.
[1550.90 → 1551.54] Her mother-in-law
[1551.54 → 1552.12] asked her,
[1552.62 → 1553.86] where did you glean today?
[1554.52 → 1555.42] Where did you work?
[1556.28 → 1557.20] Blessed be the man
[1557.20 → 1558.32] who took notice of you.
[1559.02 → 1560.32] Then Ruth told her mother-in-law
[1560.32 → 1560.98] about the one
[1560.98 → 1561.70] at whose place
[1561.70 → 1562.42] she had been working.
[1563.06 → 1563.80] The name of the man
[1563.80 → 1564.72] I worked with today
[1564.72 → 1565.60] is Boaz,
[1565.88 → 1566.40] she said.
[1567.02 → 1568.84] The Lord bless him,
[1569.02 → 1569.48] Naomi said
[1569.48 → 1570.28] to her daughter-in-law.
[1570.60 → 1571.74] He has not stopped
[1571.74 → 1572.54] showing kindness
[1572.54 → 1573.32] to the living
[1573.32 → 1574.16] and the dead,
[1574.98 → 1575.58] she added.
[1575.94 → 1576.66] That man
[1576.66 → 1577.76] is a close relative.
[1578.50 → 1579.10] He is one
[1579.10 → 1581.08] of our family guardians.
[1584.88 → 1585.36] Well,
[1585.40 → 1586.00] Caden works
[1586.00 → 1586.96] in the area
[1586.96 → 1587.78] of excavation
[1587.78 → 1588.44] and I thought
[1588.44 → 1589.04] I would open
[1589.04 → 1589.80] with an illustration,
[1589.94 → 1590.88] the only illustration
[1590.88 → 1591.48] I know of
[1591.48 → 1592.28] that connects to it.
[1593.60 → 1595.04] When I was 17 years old
[1595.04 → 1596.24] for a very short period
[1596.24 → 1596.70] of time,
[1596.84 → 1598.76] I delivered rental equipment
[1598.76 → 1600.10] to people doing renovations
[1600.10 → 1601.30] and landscape work.
[1602.08 → 1603.28] And on one particular day,
[1603.40 → 1604.14] I was delivering
[1604.14 → 1605.40] a mini excavator
[1605.40 → 1606.92] to a homeowner
[1606.92 → 1607.90] who happened to live
[1607.90 → 1608.48] on a hill
[1608.48 → 1610.08] and he had a very long,
[1610.26 → 1610.86] steep driveway
[1610.86 → 1612.42] that went up to his house.
[1613.04 → 1613.78] And so I backed
[1613.78 → 1614.58] this truck up
[1614.58 → 1615.14] with a trailer
[1615.14 → 1616.36] that had the backhoe on it
[1616.36 → 1617.92] and I got to his front door
[1617.92 → 1619.38] and then I started pulling
[1619.38 → 1620.34] this little excavator
[1620.34 → 1621.56] off the back of the trailer
[1621.56 → 1623.06] and when I did that,
[1623.42 → 1624.86] the weight of the excavator
[1624.86 → 1626.52] lifted the back
[1626.52 → 1627.10] of the truck
[1627.10 → 1627.96] off the ground
[1627.96 → 1629.08] and so it was like a V.
[1629.82 → 1630.92] And then the truck,
[1631.10 → 1631.98] trailer and me
[1631.98 → 1632.86] with the excavator
[1632.86 → 1633.78] started sliding
[1633.78 → 1634.70] down the driveway
[1634.70 → 1636.70] and I did the only thing
[1636.70 → 1637.66] my 17-year-old brain
[1637.66 → 1638.16] knew how to do
[1638.16 → 1638.88] which is jump
[1638.88 → 1640.14] off the excavator
[1640.14 → 1641.86] and I hit the ground
[1641.86 → 1642.72] and I looked
[1642.72 → 1643.58] to my horror
[1643.58 → 1644.62] as this truck
[1644.62 → 1645.54] sped into
[1645.54 → 1646.20] with the trailer
[1646.20 → 1646.78] and excavator
[1646.78 → 1647.98] through the front
[1647.98 → 1648.76] flowerbed
[1648.76 → 1649.84] over the mailbox
[1649.84 → 1651.16] and smashed
[1651.16 → 1651.66] right into
[1651.66 → 1652.50] the homeowner's car
[1652.50 → 1653.40] which was parked
[1653.40 → 1653.88] on the driveway
[1653.88 → 1654.46] or the road.
[1655.76 → 1656.44] I told you
[1656.44 → 1657.08] I only had a job
[1657.08 → 1657.94] for a short period of time.
[1660.44 → 1661.54] Here's what happened next.
[1662.06 → 1662.70] The homeowner,
[1663.34 → 1664.30] fairly large man
[1664.30 → 1664.96] comes over to me
[1664.96 → 1665.48] and he puts his hand
[1665.48 → 1665.92] on my shoulder
[1665.92 → 1666.34] and he says,
[1666.44 → 1666.84] it's okay.
[1667.46 → 1668.50] We'll sort this out.
[1668.64 → 1669.34] It's just a car.
[1669.86 → 1670.64] We walk down
[1670.64 → 1671.38] this long driveway,
[1671.74 → 1672.44] start cleaning up
[1672.44 → 1673.06] some of the debris,
[1673.24 → 1673.92] try to put the mailbox
[1673.92 → 1674.86] back in the ground
[1674.86 → 1676.06] and then I finally
[1676.06 → 1676.62] get set up
[1676.62 → 1677.46] and I drive the truck
[1677.46 → 1678.28] which is still drivable
[1678.28 → 1679.36] back to the shop
[1679.36 → 1680.10] and I'm like
[1680.10 → 1681.50] so afraid
[1681.50 → 1682.18] not just because
[1682.18 → 1682.74] of what just happened
[1682.74 → 1683.66] but because my boss
[1683.66 → 1684.38] was not the most
[1684.38 → 1685.10] patient man.
[1685.56 → 1686.22] So I'm driving
[1686.22 → 1687.08] back to the shop
[1687.08 → 1688.18] and when I get there
[1688.18 → 1688.80] in the driveway
[1688.80 → 1690.04] he's already walking
[1690.04 → 1691.20] fast towards me
[1691.20 → 1692.64] and I'm nervous.
[1693.12 → 1693.92] I get out of the truck
[1693.92 → 1694.44] and he says,
[1694.58 → 1695.50] I just got off the phone
[1695.50 → 1696.16] with the homeowner
[1696.16 → 1697.34] and he told me
[1697.34 → 1698.64] not to get mad at you.
[1699.42 → 1700.10] He told me
[1700.10 → 1701.20] that it's not your fault,
[1701.38 → 1702.40] the trailer's underrated
[1702.40 → 1702.90] for the weight
[1702.90 → 1703.74] of the excavator
[1703.74 → 1704.90] and that he's not
[1704.90 → 1705.68] going to press charges
[1705.68 → 1706.58] over all that happened.
[1707.82 → 1710.62] I was so relieved.
[1711.22 → 1712.46] I mean this total stranger
[1712.46 → 1713.46] could have yelled at me,
[1713.56 → 1713.86] could have made
[1713.86 → 1714.52] my life difficult,
[1714.88 → 1716.32] my boss could have fired me,
[1716.42 → 1717.30] everything I was imagining
[1717.30 → 1718.04] could have gone wrong
[1718.04 → 1719.26] and this total stranger
[1719.26 → 1720.60] chose to be kind.
[1721.82 → 1722.48] At that moment
[1722.48 → 1723.78] driving that little excavator
[1723.78 → 1724.70] in that short season
[1724.70 → 1725.34] of my life
[1725.34 → 1726.38] I experienced
[1726.38 → 1727.72] unexpected kindness.
[1729.44 → 1730.00] Now the reason
[1730.00 → 1730.64] I share this story
[1730.64 → 1731.20] is not just because
[1731.20 → 1731.72] it connects to
[1731.72 → 1732.24] Caden's life
[1732.24 → 1732.96] and excavation.
[1733.74 → 1734.48] It's because
[1734.48 → 1736.18] Ruth 2 is all about
[1736.18 → 1737.28] unexpected kindness.
[1738.18 → 1738.50] In fact,
[1738.56 → 1739.46] there's a repeated word
[1739.46 → 1740.34] that shows up
[1740.34 → 1741.12] in the book of Ruth
[1741.12 → 1741.96] a few times
[1741.96 → 1742.96] and it's the Hebrew word
[1742.96 → 1743.76] heed.
[1744.42 → 1745.28] Now it's one of those words
[1745.28 → 1746.62] that has no direct translation
[1746.62 → 1747.42] to English.
[1747.86 → 1748.84] It can mean loyalty,
[1749.14 → 1750.46] it can mean faithfulness,
[1750.52 → 1751.50] it can mean compassion
[1751.50 → 1752.56] and in the book of Ruth
[1752.56 → 1754.32] it is continually translated
[1754.32 → 1755.96] as kindness.
[1757.60 → 1758.46] And in the book of Ruth
[1758.46 → 1759.14] we need to know
[1759.14 → 1760.46] that one of the major things
[1760.46 → 1761.34] that we see happening
[1761.34 → 1762.80] is God showing
[1762.80 → 1764.08] His kindness
[1764.08 → 1766.12] to this outsider family
[1766.12 → 1766.86] that is poor
[1766.86 → 1768.28] and in great need
[1768.28 → 1769.50] and as God shows
[1769.50 → 1770.32] His kindness to them
[1770.32 → 1771.16] it shows up
[1771.16 → 1773.82] through ordinary people
[1773.82 → 1775.70] expressing their kindness.
[1776.62 → 1777.26] God is working
[1777.26 → 1777.80] in and through
[1777.80 → 1778.74] ordinary kindness
[1778.74 → 1780.18] to reveal His provision,
[1780.36 → 1780.74] His love
[1780.74 → 1782.06] and His kindness.
[1782.48 → 1783.22] That's what's happening
[1783.22 → 1784.38] in our chapter.
[1785.82 → 1786.30] Now Ruth 2
[1786.30 → 1786.82] is broken up
[1786.82 → 1787.58] into three sections
[1787.58 → 1788.70] or sort of three scenes.
[1788.80 → 1789.40] The first scene
[1789.40 → 1790.56] introduction to Boaz
[1790.56 → 1791.44] in the first three verses.
[1792.12 → 1793.24] Verse 13 to 17
[1793.24 → 1794.24] is the interaction
[1794.24 → 1795.58] between Boaz and Ruth
[1795.58 → 1796.84] as she works in his field
[1796.84 → 1798.24] and then the final scene
[1798.24 → 1799.24] is Ruth and Naomi
[1799.24 → 1800.02] debriefing
[1800.02 → 1800.74] and talking about
[1800.74 → 1801.94] this guy named Boaz
[1801.94 → 1802.92] in general.
[1804.20 → 1805.50] It starts by letting
[1805.50 → 1806.52] the reader know
[1806.52 → 1807.56] that Boaz
[1807.56 → 1808.66] just happens
[1808.66 → 1809.62] to be part of
[1809.62 → 1811.20] Naomi's husband's
[1811.20 → 1812.12] extended clan.
[1812.78 → 1812.92] You know,
[1812.98 → 1813.38] you'll notice
[1813.38 → 1814.48] in the book of Ruth
[1814.48 → 1815.12] there's always this
[1815.12 → 1816.04] as it turns out
[1816.04 → 1817.02] it just so happens
[1817.02 → 1817.30] well,
[1817.66 → 1818.38] in the family
[1818.38 → 1819.22] it so happens
[1819.22 → 1819.98] that there's this guy
[1819.98 → 1820.68] named Boaz
[1820.68 → 1821.34] and we're going to see
[1821.34 → 1822.14] how Ruth lands up
[1822.14 → 1822.82] in his field.
[1823.38 → 1824.30] But what matters
[1824.30 → 1825.42] about these first few verses
[1825.42 → 1827.90] is Boaz is described
[1827.90 → 1829.58] as a man of standing.
[1830.84 → 1831.56] Different translations
[1831.56 → 1832.54] will say he's a man
[1832.54 → 1833.20] of worth
[1833.20 → 1834.44] or a man of value
[1834.44 → 1835.72] or a man of wealth
[1835.72 → 1836.90] because all of those things
[1836.90 → 1837.64] capture Boaz.
[1837.76 → 1838.26] He is a man.
[1838.36 → 1839.08] He owns fields.
[1839.22 → 1840.02] He has his workers.
[1840.46 → 1841.84] He is a man of good standing
[1841.84 → 1842.70] because his character
[1842.70 → 1843.42] is known.
[1844.04 → 1845.20] He's highly respected
[1845.20 → 1846.06] in his community.
[1846.42 → 1846.92] And we're going to see
[1846.92 → 1847.82] for the rest of the story
[1847.82 → 1848.18] really
[1848.18 → 1849.64] how Boaz illustrates
[1849.64 → 1850.36] the nature
[1850.36 → 1851.14] of his character.
[1852.60 → 1854.14] Scene two then starts
[1854.14 → 1855.70] zooming in on Ruth.
[1855.82 → 1856.14] Remember,
[1856.58 → 1857.82] Ruth is this Mobile woman
[1857.82 → 1858.90] who left everything
[1858.90 → 1860.10] to follow Naomi
[1860.10 → 1860.98] back to Israel
[1860.98 → 1862.22] and Ruth,
[1862.46 → 1863.64] like many immigrant women,
[1864.02 → 1864.72] she came ready
[1864.72 → 1865.44] to work
[1865.44 → 1866.48] to provide
[1866.48 → 1867.14] for her family
[1867.14 → 1867.72] and the first thing
[1867.72 → 1868.46] she does is what?
[1869.20 → 1870.22] She goes to the fields
[1870.22 → 1871.70] and she starts gleaning.
[1872.20 → 1872.30] Now,
[1872.32 → 1872.54] do we know
[1872.54 → 1873.26] what gleaning is?
[1873.94 → 1874.42] Gleaning is not
[1874.42 → 1875.32] a common word
[1875.32 → 1876.16] in our day
[1876.16 → 1877.40] and I'll just give
[1877.40 → 1878.10] a bit of background
[1878.10 → 1878.62] on it.
[1879.00 → 1879.74] There was a command
[1879.74 → 1881.10] that God gave his people
[1881.10 → 1882.40] in the Old Testament
[1882.40 → 1884.12] called the gleaning command
[1884.12 → 1885.04] and I'll read for you
[1885.04 → 1886.50] a passage from Leviticus.
[1886.72 → 1887.22] I'll just say,
[1887.58 → 1888.34] you really get a sense
[1888.34 → 1889.00] of the heart of God
[1889.00 → 1889.60] in this passage?
[1890.16 → 1890.96] He says to his people,
[1891.20 → 1891.72] when you reap
[1891.72 → 1893.18] the harvest of your land,
[1893.46 → 1894.10] do not reap
[1894.10 → 1894.94] to the very edges
[1894.94 → 1895.64] of your field
[1895.64 → 1896.60] or gather gleaning
[1896.60 → 1897.74] of your harvest.
[1898.22 → 1899.14] And then about vineyards,
[1899.24 → 1900.00] do not go over
[1900.00 → 1901.24] your vineyard a second time
[1901.24 → 1902.38] or pick up the grapes
[1902.38 → 1902.94] that have fallen.
[1903.10 → 1903.68] Here's the point.
[1903.68 → 1905.62] Leave them for the poor
[1905.62 → 1906.74] and the foreigner.
[1906.94 → 1907.92] I am the Lord,
[1908.28 → 1908.90] your God.
[1909.48 → 1910.56] Don't you love that law?
[1911.46 → 1912.10] God who's like,
[1912.16 → 1913.00] I love the foreigners
[1913.00 → 1913.54] and the poor
[1913.54 → 1914.06] in your community
[1914.06 → 1914.98] so much that you're not
[1914.98 → 1915.68] allowed to use
[1915.68 → 1916.26] all your crops,
[1916.50 → 1916.78] you're not allowed
[1916.78 → 1917.70] to pick all your grapes
[1917.70 → 1918.94] because I want to use that
[1918.94 → 1920.08] to care for those
[1920.08 → 1920.72] who are vulnerable.
[1921.60 → 1922.86] Our God has a heart
[1922.86 → 1923.68] for the vulnerable
[1923.68 → 1925.74] and his laws reflect that.
[1926.68 → 1926.90] Now,
[1926.96 → 1927.74] we don't know how often
[1927.74 → 1928.68] gleaning was practiced.
[1929.18 → 1929.98] There's a very good chance
[1929.98 → 1930.86] that very few farmers
[1930.86 → 1931.26] did it.
[1931.26 → 1932.02] And also,
[1932.50 → 1933.76] gleaning is very dangerous.
[1934.06 → 1934.56] Here's why.
[1935.18 → 1935.60] Often,
[1935.72 → 1936.54] it would be a single
[1936.54 → 1937.32] foreign female
[1937.32 → 1938.12] like Ruth
[1938.12 → 1939.38] in a field
[1939.38 → 1940.66] of Israel workers.
[1941.26 → 1942.12] And the women
[1942.12 → 1943.06] who are working there
[1943.06 → 1944.50] have no protection
[1944.50 → 1945.14] under the law.
[1945.72 → 1946.38] The workers there
[1946.38 → 1947.60] might not be good people.
[1947.72 → 1948.64] They might take advantage
[1948.64 → 1949.26] of this woman.
[1949.50 → 1950.66] And you even see Boaz
[1950.66 → 1951.34] saying to his workers,
[1951.46 → 1952.36] don't you touch that woman.
[1953.08 → 1953.90] You take care of her
[1953.90 → 1955.32] because gleaning isn't safe.
[1955.42 → 1955.62] And so,
[1955.72 → 1956.78] Ruth is putting herself
[1956.78 → 1958.16] in a vulnerable position
[1958.16 → 1959.44] as a single
[1959.44 → 1960.72] foreign female worker.
[1960.72 → 1963.26] But it just so happens
[1963.26 → 1964.58] that she lands up
[1964.58 → 1965.22] in whose field?
[1966.36 → 1966.96] Boaz's field.
[1967.76 → 1968.60] And we get a sense
[1968.60 → 1969.32] of Boaz's character
[1969.32 → 1969.78] right away.
[1969.86 → 1970.98] When he walks to his farm,
[1971.12 → 1971.98] he goes to his field,
[1972.06 → 1972.86] he says to his workers,
[1973.10 → 1974.32] the Lord be with you.
[1974.40 → 1975.12] And they respond,
[1975.32 → 1976.18] and the Lord bless you.
[1976.24 → 1976.92] This guy sounds like
[1976.92 → 1977.90] a pastor, right?
[1979.14 → 1980.06] And Boaz then sees
[1980.06 → 1981.04] this woman working
[1981.04 → 1981.96] in the corner of his field
[1981.96 → 1983.30] and he goes to his overseer.
[1983.40 → 1983.52] You know,
[1983.56 → 1985.04] this is before Facebook scrolling
[1985.04 → 1985.52] and, you know,
[1985.60 → 1986.40] stalking people
[1986.40 → 1987.18] on social media.
[1987.32 → 1988.50] He goes to his overseer
[1988.50 → 1988.86] and he's like,
[1988.90 → 1989.84] who's that woman over there?
[1989.84 → 1991.18] And the overseer
[1991.18 → 1992.74] gives this report of Ruth.
[1992.84 → 1993.42] He says, you know,
[1993.50 → 1994.68] she left her home.
[1994.84 → 1995.82] She was committed
[1995.82 → 1996.78] to her mother-in-law,
[1996.88 → 1997.20] Naomi.
[1997.60 → 1998.20] She's working
[1998.20 → 1998.86] to take care of her.
[1998.94 → 2000.04] She asked for permission
[2000.04 → 2000.74] to be here.
[2001.34 → 2002.48] Boaz takes this information
[2002.48 → 2003.26] and then he goes
[2003.26 → 2004.90] to talk to Ruth.
[2005.58 → 2007.30] And in this next section,
[2008.08 → 2009.18] you really get a sense
[2009.18 → 2011.14] of this unexpected kindness.
[2011.98 → 2013.16] Four particular ways
[2013.16 → 2013.84] Boaz expresses
[2014.62 → 2016.76] the kindness he has.
[2016.76 → 2018.18] He expresses this character
[2018.18 → 2018.90] that wants to care
[2018.90 → 2019.38] for someone.
[2019.96 → 2020.66] So let's take a look.
[2020.74 → 2022.10] The first thing Boaz does
[2022.10 → 2023.62] is provided for her.
[2024.38 → 2025.30] He says to Ruth
[2025.30 → 2026.36] in verse 8,
[2027.64 → 2028.44] don't go and glean
[2028.44 → 2029.20] in another field
[2029.20 → 2030.00] and don't go away
[2030.00 → 2030.48] from here.
[2030.84 → 2031.92] Stay here with the women
[2031.92 → 2032.74] who work for me.
[2033.26 → 2033.92] Watch the field
[2033.92 → 2034.76] where the men are harvesting
[2034.76 → 2035.70] and follow along
[2035.70 → 2036.54] after the women.
[2037.16 → 2038.20] I have told the men
[2038.20 → 2039.98] not to lay a hand on you
[2039.98 → 2041.08] and whenever you're thirsty,
[2041.54 → 2042.20] go get a drink
[2042.20 → 2043.10] from the jars of water
[2043.10 → 2044.08] the men have filled.
[2044.66 → 2045.44] And you get a sense here
[2045.44 → 2046.90] that Boaz is seriously
[2046.90 → 2048.06] thinking on her behalf.
[2048.70 → 2049.28] He's not thinking
[2049.28 → 2050.26] as a wealthy landowner
[2050.26 → 2051.18] who has his needs met.
[2051.22 → 2051.52] He's thinking,
[2051.76 → 2052.36] here's a woman
[2052.36 → 2053.18] who left everything.
[2053.46 → 2054.24] How can I care
[2054.24 → 2055.36] for the basic needs
[2055.36 → 2056.66] that she has to meet?
[2056.84 → 2057.98] And that's how he can do it.
[2058.82 → 2060.02] But then in the next verse,
[2060.10 → 2060.94] we get the why.
[2061.06 → 2063.06] Like why is Boaz doing this?
[2063.20 → 2064.68] And we see in these next verses
[2064.68 → 2066.38] this sense of his second
[2066.38 → 2067.30] act of kindness
[2067.30 → 2068.34] which is to pray a prayer
[2068.34 → 2069.52] of blessing over her.
[2070.32 → 2071.00] Boaz realizes
[2071.00 → 2071.54] it's not just he
[2071.54 → 2072.22] who has good character,
[2072.36 → 2073.44] it is Ruth herself.
[2073.44 → 2075.02] And he says to her,
[2075.68 → 2076.32] I have been told
[2076.32 → 2077.62] all about what you have done
[2077.62 → 2078.52] for your mother-in-law
[2078.52 → 2079.70] and since the death
[2079.70 → 2080.30] of your husband.
[2080.84 → 2081.88] How you left your father
[2081.88 → 2082.48] and your mother
[2082.48 → 2083.28] and your homeland
[2083.28 → 2084.16] and came to live
[2084.16 → 2084.58] with a people
[2084.58 → 2086.04] you did not know before.
[2086.66 → 2087.42] So here's the prayer.
[2088.18 → 2089.38] May the Lord repay you
[2089.38 → 2090.36] for what you have done.
[2090.78 → 2092.24] May you be richly rewarded
[2092.24 → 2092.92] by the Lord,
[2093.04 → 2093.94] the God of Israel
[2093.94 → 2095.26] under whose wings
[2095.26 → 2096.40] you have come
[2096.40 → 2097.44] to take refuge.
[2097.86 → 2099.02] I love that prayer.
[2100.24 → 2100.52] You want to know
[2100.52 → 2100.86] something cool
[2100.86 → 2101.46] about this prayer?
[2102.28 → 2103.16] Boaz is just being
[2103.16 → 2104.12] a kind person.
[2104.54 → 2105.26] He's praying a prayer
[2105.26 → 2106.52] blessing over Ruth
[2106.52 → 2107.70] and what he doesn't know
[2107.70 → 2108.36] is that God
[2108.36 → 2109.66] is going to use him
[2109.66 → 2111.54] to answer his own prayer.
[2112.60 → 2113.14] Isn't that a wonderful
[2113.14 → 2113.82] part of the story?
[2114.26 → 2115.08] Boaz is just praying,
[2115.18 → 2116.38] hey, may the Lord bless you.
[2116.44 → 2117.40] You've come to this land,
[2117.50 → 2118.64] you've sacrificed a lot
[2118.64 → 2120.24] and what he doesn't even know
[2120.24 → 2121.26] is that God's going to use
[2121.26 → 2122.50] his land ownership,
[2123.02 → 2123.78] his fields,
[2124.06 → 2125.72] his role as a guardian redeemer
[2125.72 → 2126.62] to bless Ruth,
[2126.88 → 2127.72] to bless Naomi
[2127.72 → 2128.76] and to give a king
[2128.76 → 2129.80] to his people.
[2129.80 → 2131.76] And don't be surprised
[2131.76 → 2132.28] by the way
[2132.28 → 2133.10] when you're praying
[2133.10 → 2133.64] for someone,
[2134.16 → 2135.14] you're concerned for them
[2135.14 → 2136.04] and you get drawn
[2136.04 → 2136.96] into the plot
[2136.96 → 2138.52] and it's your acts
[2138.52 → 2139.30] of care and kindness
[2139.30 → 2140.02] that God uses
[2140.02 → 2140.72] to bless,
[2141.28 → 2141.66] protect
[2141.66 → 2142.94] and to take care of.
[2144.38 → 2145.44] Well, if those two things
[2145.44 → 2145.82] weren't enough,
[2145.92 → 2147.24] the next step of kindness
[2147.24 → 2147.88] for Boaz
[2147.88 → 2148.78] is hospitality.
[2149.44 → 2150.00] He says to Ruth,
[2150.06 → 2150.46] hey, Ruth,
[2150.80 → 2151.54] at the end of the day,
[2151.66 → 2152.38] come join the people
[2152.38 → 2152.98] who work for me,
[2153.08 → 2153.42] we're going to have
[2153.42 → 2154.12] a meal together
[2154.12 → 2155.30] and I would like for you
[2155.30 → 2156.14] to have some food.
[2156.80 → 2158.08] And even more surprising
[2158.08 → 2159.08] and subversive,
[2159.50 → 2160.30] in the ancient Near East,
[2160.46 → 2161.24] it would often be,
[2161.34 → 2162.44] perhaps almost always,
[2162.88 → 2163.92] it would be the poor women
[2163.92 → 2165.04] who serve the wealthy men.
[2165.12 → 2165.94] That's just how it would go.
[2166.02 → 2166.72] And in this story,
[2166.76 → 2167.50] if you look closely,
[2167.90 → 2168.76] what does Boaz do?
[2169.70 → 2171.00] He serves Ruth.
[2171.74 → 2172.72] And I have to think
[2172.72 → 2173.32] there are some women
[2173.32 → 2173.84] who work there
[2173.84 → 2174.38] and even the men
[2174.38 → 2174.84] who work there
[2174.84 → 2175.12] are saying,
[2175.26 → 2176.14] what is going on here?
[2176.24 → 2177.08] Like, this guy
[2177.08 → 2177.90] is either smitten,
[2178.86 → 2179.16] you know,
[2179.28 → 2179.84] he's going a little
[2179.84 → 2180.46] over the top,
[2180.60 → 2182.68] or he really genuinely cares
[2182.68 → 2183.62] for this woman
[2183.62 → 2184.58] who has given up everything
[2184.58 → 2185.38] to be in his fields
[2185.38 → 2186.40] and he wants her
[2186.40 → 2187.42] to know that she's welcome
[2187.42 → 2188.34] and that he's going
[2188.34 → 2189.10] to take care of her.
[2190.54 → 2191.20] And then finally,
[2191.34 → 2192.04] this sort of finishes
[2192.04 → 2193.00] the second scene.
[2194.32 → 2194.50] You know,
[2194.56 → 2195.16] Ruth goes back
[2195.16 → 2196.00] to the field to glean
[2196.00 → 2197.48] and Boaz says
[2197.48 → 2197.96] to his workers,
[2198.50 → 2199.68] don't just let her glean
[2199.68 → 2200.76] on the edges of the fields.
[2200.98 → 2201.70] That's a little further.
[2202.26 → 2203.52] Make sure that she can collect
[2203.52 → 2205.18] from the sheaves of barley.
[2205.30 → 2206.16] And that's a huge deal
[2206.16 → 2206.82] because the people
[2206.82 → 2207.60] have already done the work
[2207.60 → 2208.44] they've collected them
[2208.44 → 2209.32] and Boaz says,
[2209.40 → 2209.58] Ruth,
[2209.78 → 2210.50] she can actually collect
[2210.50 → 2210.96] from the work
[2210.96 → 2211.58] that you've done
[2211.58 → 2212.16] and that means
[2212.16 → 2212.66] she can collect
[2212.66 → 2213.74] way more barley.
[2214.62 → 2215.02] And so at the end
[2215.02 → 2215.54] of scene two,
[2215.62 → 2216.38] we're told that she goes
[2216.38 → 2217.40] home with an epoch
[2217.40 → 2218.54] of barley.
[2218.70 → 2219.16] And that's,
[2219.56 → 2220.18] scholars estimate
[2220.18 → 2221.98] between 20 and 50 pounds
[2221.98 → 2223.02] of barley.
[2223.52 → 2224.02] And I don't even know
[2224.02 → 2224.64] if I could carry
[2224.64 → 2225.72] as much as she did home.
[2226.48 → 2227.34] But that brings us
[2227.34 → 2228.40] to the final scene
[2228.40 → 2229.12] of this story
[2229.12 → 2230.44] where Ruth goes back
[2230.44 → 2230.92] to Naomi
[2230.92 → 2231.84] and you can just picture
[2231.84 → 2232.50] the scene for a minute.
[2232.64 → 2233.44] Naomi probably sees
[2233.44 → 2234.20] Ruth come home,
[2234.62 → 2234.86] you know,
[2234.92 → 2236.32] and she sees like 50 pounds
[2236.32 → 2236.74] of barley
[2236.74 → 2237.36] and she's like,
[2237.92 → 2240.34] where did you work?
[2240.34 → 2242.56] What were the circumstances
[2242.56 → 2243.80] that led to extra food
[2243.80 → 2244.46] from the meal
[2244.46 → 2246.10] and 50 pounds of barley
[2246.10 → 2246.94] on your first day
[2246.94 → 2247.42] of gleaning?
[2247.96 → 2248.52] And Ruth's like,
[2248.60 → 2248.88] well,
[2249.04 → 2249.78] there's this guy
[2249.78 → 2250.38] who just happens
[2250.38 → 2251.12] to own this field
[2251.12 → 2252.64] and his name is Boaz.
[2253.00 → 2253.82] And that triggers
[2253.82 → 2255.54] a really important verse
[2255.54 → 2256.20] in this passage,
[2256.32 → 2256.82] verse 20,
[2257.20 → 2258.18] where Naomi says,
[2258.36 → 2260.50] the Lord bless him,
[2260.62 → 2261.12] Naomi says
[2261.12 → 2261.92] to her daughter-in-law.
[2262.30 → 2263.68] He has not stopped
[2263.68 → 2264.60] showing kindness
[2264.60 → 2265.50] to the living
[2265.50 → 2266.24] and the dead.
[2266.94 → 2267.82] And then she adds,
[2267.82 → 2269.88] this man is our close relative.
[2270.66 → 2271.46] He is one of our
[2271.46 → 2273.24] guardian redeemers.
[2274.16 → 2274.38] Now,
[2274.44 → 2275.46] two important things to note.
[2275.94 → 2277.28] That word kindness
[2277.28 → 2278.50] is heed.
[2279.34 → 2280.42] That man has not
[2280.42 → 2282.18] stopped showing heed,
[2282.34 → 2282.90] compassion,
[2283.22 → 2283.72] faithfulness,
[2283.80 → 2284.36] and kindness
[2284.36 → 2285.12] to our family
[2285.12 → 2285.92] for the living
[2285.92 → 2286.44] and the dead.
[2286.52 → 2286.80] And then,
[2286.90 → 2287.14] of course,
[2287.20 → 2287.72] this addition,
[2288.14 → 2289.06] it just so happens
[2289.06 → 2289.72] that the field
[2289.72 → 2290.76] you went to glean
[2290.76 → 2291.88] belongs to this
[2291.88 → 2292.68] family relative
[2292.68 → 2293.44] who's one of our
[2293.44 → 2295.14] guardian redeemers.
[2295.78 → 2295.96] Now,
[2296.14 → 2297.46] we're probably not familiar
[2297.46 → 2298.02] with that phrase
[2298.02 → 2298.74] guardian redeemer.
[2298.92 → 2299.68] We're going to come back
[2299.68 → 2300.64] in the next couple of weeks,
[2300.90 → 2301.66] but just some quick
[2301.66 → 2302.10] background.
[2302.36 → 2303.42] In the ancient Near East,
[2303.84 → 2304.82] within Israel,
[2304.96 → 2306.42] within a large family clan,
[2306.50 → 2307.10] there was a person
[2307.10 → 2308.16] who was called the Goal
[2308.16 → 2309.04] or the redeemer.
[2309.62 → 2310.52] And their job
[2310.52 → 2311.20] was to make sure
[2311.20 → 2312.06] that their people
[2312.06 → 2313.22] were being taken care of,
[2313.34 → 2313.84] that their needs
[2313.84 → 2314.46] were being met,
[2314.52 → 2315.48] that their food
[2315.48 → 2316.06] and water.
[2316.36 → 2317.18] If someone fell
[2317.18 → 2317.94] into difficulty,
[2318.10 → 2318.68] they would help.
[2318.76 → 2319.84] If someone ran into debt,
[2320.06 → 2321.14] they would help pay it off.
[2321.22 → 2322.42] And often what happened,
[2323.10 → 2324.46] if someone had major debt,
[2324.54 → 2325.84] they would fall into slavery.
[2326.22 → 2326.94] You'd become a slave
[2326.94 → 2327.40] to a person
[2327.40 → 2328.24] in order to pay off
[2328.24 → 2328.66] your debt.
[2328.96 → 2329.16] Well,
[2329.24 → 2330.54] in those circumstances,
[2330.54 → 2331.70] it's the redeemer,
[2331.82 → 2332.80] the guardian redeemer,
[2333.02 → 2334.18] who would step in
[2334.18 → 2335.18] and whatever cost
[2335.18 → 2336.08] was needed to be paid,
[2336.22 → 2337.22] they would pay
[2337.22 → 2338.38] in order to buy
[2338.38 → 2339.18] that person back
[2339.18 → 2339.64] their freedom
[2339.64 → 2340.58] and bring them
[2340.58 → 2341.32] into the family.
[2342.44 → 2343.40] And isn't it interesting
[2343.40 → 2344.78] that Boaz
[2344.78 → 2345.92] happens to be
[2345.92 → 2346.88] the guardian redeemer
[2346.88 → 2348.32] for Naomi and Ruth
[2348.32 → 2349.38] as they come back
[2349.38 → 2349.90] to Israel?
[2351.68 → 2352.16] Now,
[2352.28 → 2352.86] I don't want to steal
[2352.86 → 2353.56] Jonathan's sermon
[2353.56 → 2354.04] next week,
[2354.08 → 2355.08] but let me just say this.
[2355.08 → 2356.44] I hope you can see
[2356.44 → 2357.54] some foreshadowing
[2357.54 → 2359.44] of Jesus in this passage.
[2359.54 → 2360.04] Do you see it?
[2360.64 → 2361.84] How is Jesus described
[2361.84 → 2362.66] in Galatians 4?
[2363.54 → 2364.70] The redeemer.
[2366.14 → 2367.40] Jesus comes to rescue
[2367.40 → 2368.38] people from slavery,
[2368.50 → 2369.32] not just to debt
[2369.32 → 2370.78] like actual financial debt,
[2371.12 → 2372.56] but slavery to sin
[2372.56 → 2374.50] and slavery to death
[2374.50 → 2376.38] and temptation to Satan.
[2377.06 → 2377.74] And Galatians 4
[2377.74 → 2378.50] describes Jesus
[2378.50 → 2379.94] as this kinsman redeemer
[2379.94 → 2381.00] who shows up
[2381.00 → 2381.86] for his world
[2381.86 → 2383.08] and for his people
[2383.08 → 2384.16] so that he can
[2384.16 → 2385.66] buy them back
[2385.66 → 2386.88] and bring them
[2386.88 → 2387.66] into his family.
[2389.82 → 2390.60] Charles Spurgeon
[2390.60 → 2391.86] has done a lot of work
[2391.86 → 2392.64] connecting the book
[2392.64 → 2394.18] of Ruth to Jesus.
[2394.36 → 2394.90] And I want to read
[2394.90 → 2395.70] a quote that comes
[2395.70 → 2396.04] from him
[2396.04 → 2396.72] that just connects
[2396.72 → 2397.28] some dots
[2397.28 → 2397.84] and we're going to
[2397.84 → 2398.38] fill these in
[2398.38 → 2398.84] even more
[2398.84 → 2399.78] in the next couple of weeks.
[2400.14 → 2400.58] He writes,
[2401.10 → 2402.18] As Ruth found favour
[2402.18 → 2403.20] in the eyes of Boaz,
[2403.30 → 2404.32] so we find favour
[2404.32 → 2405.24] in the eyes of Jesus.
[2405.98 → 2407.24] As Boaz was considered
[2407.24 → 2408.20] a man of standing
[2408.20 → 2408.96] among his people,
[2408.96 → 2410.58] Jesus stands above
[2410.58 → 2411.98] all other men.
[2412.94 → 2414.52] Boaz was a near kinsman
[2414.52 → 2415.10] to Ruth.
[2415.54 → 2417.08] Jesus took on flesh
[2417.08 → 2418.78] to become our near kinsman.
[2419.40 → 2420.58] Out of his love for her,
[2420.78 → 2421.56] Boaz was willing
[2421.56 → 2422.72] to redeem Ruth.
[2423.26 → 2424.42] Out of his great love
[2424.42 → 2425.40] for us too,
[2425.98 → 2427.04] Jesus was willing
[2427.04 → 2428.04] to redeem us
[2428.04 → 2428.76] and I will add,
[2428.98 → 2430.08] at a great cost.
[2431.60 → 2433.30] Now I can't say these words
[2433.30 → 2434.48] without pointing to Caden
[2434.48 → 2434.96] and saying,
[2435.28 → 2435.92] This morning,
[2436.12 → 2436.76] we are witnessing
[2436.76 → 2437.82] in real time
[2437.82 → 2439.18] the redeeming work
[2439.18 → 2440.00] of Jesus Christ
[2440.00 → 2440.80] extended to someone
[2440.80 → 2441.42] in our church.
[2442.30 → 2442.76] We are witnessing
[2442.76 → 2445.08] in real time
[2445.08 → 2446.36] the work that Jesus
[2446.36 → 2446.88] has done
[2446.88 → 2447.32] through his death
[2447.32 → 2447.80] and resurrection
[2447.80 → 2448.86] being extended
[2448.86 → 2449.50] to someone
[2449.50 → 2450.84] and I want to say
[2450.84 → 2451.24] this right,
[2451.60 → 2452.60] he is being bought
[2452.60 → 2454.06] back from slavery
[2454.06 → 2455.76] to sin and death
[2455.76 → 2457.22] into the family
[2457.22 → 2458.16] of God.
[2458.96 → 2460.72] Praise the Lord,
[2460.92 → 2461.20] Caden.
[2461.20 → 2462.20] Amen.
[2462.20 → 2462.26] Amen.
[2462.26 → 2462.30] Amen.
[2462.30 → 2462.40] Amen.
[2462.40 → 2462.80] Amen.
[2462.80 → 2462.90] Amen.
[2462.90 → 2463.32] Amen.
[2463.32 → 2463.40] Amen.
[2463.40 → 2463.82] Amen.
[2463.82 → 2464.36] Amen.
[2464.36 → 2464.38] Amen.
[2464.38 → 2464.40] Amen.
[2464.40 → 2464.44] Amen.
[2464.44 → 2464.46] Amen.
[2467.82 → 2468.24] Amen.
[2468.36 → 2468.82] Amen.

[2492.16 → 2495.56] Jeremy.
[2495.56 → 2499.96] And then Jesus comes to redeem, to buy back, and to rescue those to himself
[2499.96 → 2506.28] so that they can reflect the chased, the kindness of his father.
[2507.10 → 2510.62] You know what Jesus does as he reaches us is he makes us fully human.
[2510.72 → 2512.48] And you know what happens when we become fully human again?
[2512.48 → 2517.74] We reflect the character of God, the kindness of God.
[2519.04 → 2523.80] And it seems to me, as I reflect on Caden's story and as I reflect on Ruth chapter 2,
[2523.80 → 2531.10] that as I said, the way we experience the kindness of God is not some vague sort of intangible thing.
[2531.36 → 2535.50] It actually shows up in concrete acts of kindness through other people.
[2536.36 → 2537.48] Is that not true for you?
[2538.04 → 2543.44] Think about your own story, how you came to faith, how you grew up, the people in your life,
[2543.50 → 2546.02] what made you actually decide to be a Christian and follow Jesus.
[2546.26 → 2550.64] I'm going to wager a guess that that involved a number of people,
[2550.64 → 2553.98] perhaps a pile of people showing you kindness.
[2554.82 → 2557.38] And then God who is sovereign and loving and generous,
[2557.82 → 2561.56] weaving your life and their lives together such that you see his love
[2561.56 → 2564.84] in tangible, concrete ways through the kindness of others.
[2564.94 → 2565.92] Is that not true for you?
[2567.04 → 2569.84] I know it's true for Caden, you just shared that, and I know it's true for me.
[2570.14 → 2575.38] But I think the way we see the hand of God is through the love and the kindness of others.
[2575.38 → 2581.30] And I just wrote down a few examples that actually all come from real life situations in our church,
[2581.40 → 2581.94] in our community.
[2583.16 → 2585.76] Perhaps the way you've experienced the kindness of God
[2585.76 → 2589.04] is actually through the listening ear of a close friend
[2589.04 → 2593.70] when you are going through serious crisis and mental health challenges.
[2593.70 → 2598.46] Perhaps for you, this time you've seen the kindness of God
[2598.46 → 2602.34] is when someone opened their home to you for the very first time
[2602.34 → 2606.68] when you've moved to a new country, and you know nobody in this place that is Canada.
[2607.90 → 2612.10] Perhaps it's you being someone who's struggling financially and not really sure what to do.
[2612.26 → 2615.04] You experience someone opening their home and having a meal with you
[2615.04 → 2617.04] when you're having a tough time.
[2617.04 → 2623.12] Perhaps it's the sacrificial generosity of someone who actually pays off your debt,
[2623.48 → 2625.94] your financial debt, because you've made some serious mistakes,
[2626.26 → 2629.98] your company has gone bankrupt, and you desperately need help.
[2630.84 → 2633.60] And it just so happens that someone shows up in your life who can.
[2634.84 → 2639.52] Or perhaps it's a thoughtful person in the church who sees that you've just had kids,
[2639.84 → 2642.18] or let's say twins, I see some twins in the back,
[2642.46 → 2645.30] or you've just gone through surgery, and you're not really able to make meals,
[2645.30 → 2648.30] and so meals show up for a month or two because those people realize
[2648.30 → 2650.88] you don't really have the capacity to cook for yourself,
[2651.10 → 2653.10] and at your doorstep shows home-cooked meal.
[2653.52 → 2654.02] What a gift.
[2654.18 → 2655.40] You see the kindness of God.
[2656.56 → 2660.40] Or perhaps it really is the first time you've ever experienced forgiveness and grace
[2660.40 → 2662.84] was through someone in the church who you hurt,
[2663.18 → 2665.34] and they said to you with the fullness of their heart,
[2665.74 → 2667.10] I forgive you.
[2668.14 → 2671.50] In all of these ways, which might feel small to us at the moment,
[2671.50 → 2673.52] God is weaving together these circumstances
[2673.52 → 2676.20] such that you see and taste and experience
[2676.20 → 2678.20] the goodness and kindness of His heart
[2678.20 → 2681.38] through human people in your life.
[2683.02 → 2684.00] And Caden, that's your story.
[2684.64 → 2686.60] So I was listening to you share your testimony on the stage.
[2687.02 → 2689.74] I was so struck by how it's the ordinary events
[2689.74 → 2691.76] of trying to leave the church,
[2692.62 → 2693.74] looping back to the church,
[2694.18 → 2695.22] trying to leave the church again.
[2695.32 → 2696.90] There's something like very biblical about this.
[2696.96 → 2698.52] Three times you looped around 68th,
[2698.52 → 2701.36] and you got stuck back in our parking lot,
[2701.74 → 2704.42] and then had the guts to call the church
[2704.42 → 2706.38] and totally creep Natalia out.
[2706.46 → 2707.64] We were like, can I come into the building?
[2708.34 → 2708.98] Natalia's like, sure.
[2709.02 → 2710.92] He's like, okay, I'm actually in the parking lot already.
[2710.98 → 2712.42] I'll be there in 13 seconds.
[2714.10 → 2716.48] And then the ordinary acts of you coming into this building,
[2716.58 → 2717.62] and Val, where are you, Val?
[2718.90 → 2720.48] Val just walking up and talk to you,
[2721.18 → 2721.92] listening to you,
[2722.78 → 2723.58] sharing with you,
[2723.58 → 2725.56] sitting at a cross,
[2725.84 → 2727.28] literally a physical cross,
[2727.44 → 2729.18] and you bring your pain to the cross,
[2729.36 → 2730.94] and she's listening, we're praying,
[2731.26 → 2732.40] you're looking at the Scriptures together,
[2732.52 → 2733.64] then Jonathan shows up
[2733.64 → 2735.46] and starts sharing with you more of the Scriptures
[2735.46 → 2736.64] and what it means to follow him.
[2736.80 → 2738.66] It's the ordinary stuff
[2738.66 → 2741.84] of Christians being kind
[2741.84 → 2745.30] that leads to conversions like this.
[2746.34 → 2748.54] In fact, so much of your story is very ordinary,
[2749.16 → 2750.34] and yet here we are celebrating
[2750.34 → 2752.04] the tangible grace of Christ
[2752.04 → 2754.40] through ordinary human acts of kindness.
[2756.32 → 2758.56] And maybe it's worth turning that into a question
[2758.56 → 2760.56] for us as a church family.
[2761.46 → 2763.38] Are there people you're praying for right now,
[2763.82 → 2765.72] perhaps in a vague, general sense,
[2766.06 → 2767.08] that God might be saying,
[2767.18 → 2768.80] it's time for you to be pulled into the plot.
[2769.42 → 2771.02] It's time for you to use your money,
[2771.26 → 2772.64] your time, your talents,
[2772.78 → 2775.08] your competencies to care.
[2775.92 → 2776.82] And don't be surprised
[2776.82 → 2778.12] when it's your ordinary life,
[2778.20 → 2779.02] your ordinary words,
[2779.02 → 2780.04] your ordinary forgiveness
[2780.04 → 2783.36] that God uses to show his kindness.
[2784.24 → 2785.90] Because Ruth 2, in the end,
[2786.26 → 2788.40] is all about the chased of God.
[2788.90 → 2789.90] It's all about his kindness
[2789.90 → 2791.32] showing up in ordinary ways.
[2791.62 → 2794.02] And what Jesus has come to do in the church
[2794.02 → 2795.62] is to create a community
[2795.62 → 2797.86] that is so full of his resurrection power,
[2798.24 → 2799.84] so full of the life of the Spirit,
[2800.08 → 2801.52] that what comes out of this community
[2801.52 → 2802.52] from Monday to Friday
[2802.52 → 2804.28] is the kindness
[2804.28 → 2806.54] that we've experienced in Jesus,
[2806.54 → 2809.22] shown in ordinary ways
[2809.22 → 2811.20] to those around us.
[2812.26 → 2813.76] Would you join me in prayer?
[2818.64 → 2820.00] Father, we praise you
[2820.00 → 2822.84] for being sovereign and in control
[2822.84 → 2825.36] and for the way that you have showed up
[2825.36 → 2827.12] in our lives in kindness.
[2827.12 → 2829.58] We praise you for the testimony
[2829.58 → 2830.78] that Caden has shared
[2830.78 → 2832.28] about how he's experienced that
[2832.28 → 2834.30] and through that has come to know
[2834.30 → 2836.42] Jesus as Saviour and life.
[2838.04 → 2840.10] Lord, would you enable us to see
[2840.10 → 2843.32] how we can care for those around us,
[2843.40 → 2845.26] particularly those who are struggling
[2845.26 → 2846.82] and vulnerable.
[2846.82 → 2849.08] We ask that you give us eyes
[2849.08 → 2850.06] to see the need,
[2850.90 → 2851.64] the capacity,
[2851.76 → 2852.30] the care,
[2852.42 → 2853.32] and make the time
[2853.32 → 2854.44] for those around us.
[2854.82 → 2856.72] And Lord, would you use us
[2856.72 → 2859.46] to bless and show your kindness
[2859.46 → 2861.20] such that many people in our city,
[2861.64 → 2862.22] in our community,
[2862.38 → 2863.22] and our workplaces
[2863.22 → 2865.72] come to know Jesus through us.
[2866.30 → 2866.98] And to that end,
[2867.02 → 2868.32] would you fill us with your Spirit?
[2869.90 → 2871.10] Would you change us
[2871.10 → 2872.34] by the power of your resurrection
[2872.34 → 2874.20] so that this community
[2874.20 → 2876.18] is one that is filled with chased?
[2876.82 → 2877.86] with your kindness.
[2878.50 → 2879.92] We pray this in Christ's name.
[2880.68 → 2880.94] Amen.
[2883.18 → 2884.34] I invite you to stand
[2884.34 → 2885.12] and sing with me
[2885.12 → 2886.06] a song of response.
[2886.20 → 2887.04] Blessed be your name.
