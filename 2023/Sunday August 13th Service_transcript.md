[1.00 --> 5.56]  Well, I was told this morning that I could preach on whatever I want, and so I decided
[5.56 --> 10.34]  we're going to look at prayer, and if you have your Bible, I invite you to turn with
[10.34 --> 11.62]  me to Luke chapter 11.
[11.88 --> 13.98]  We're going to let Jesus teach us on prayer.
[14.12 --> 18.34]  When his disciples ask him, Lord, teach us to pray, this is what Jesus teaches them.
[19.30 --> 21.20]  This is Luke chapter 11.
[21.20 --> 30.68]  One day when Jesus was praying in a certain place, when he finished, one of his disciples
[30.68 --> 33.84]  said to him, Lord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples.
[35.04 --> 39.40]  He said to them, when you pray, say, Father, hallowed be your name.
[40.20 --> 41.32]  Your kingdom come.
[42.34 --> 44.38]  Give us each day our daily bread.
[44.58 --> 49.32]  Forgive us of our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.
[49.32 --> 51.58]  And lead us not into temptation.
[52.86 --> 57.30]  Then Jesus said to them, suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say,
[57.48 --> 59.24]  friend, lend me three loaves of bread.
[59.46 --> 62.92]  A friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.
[63.68 --> 66.32]  And suppose the one inside answers, don't bother me.
[66.44 --> 68.86]  The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed.
[69.10 --> 70.82]  I can't get up and give you anything.
[71.76 --> 75.24]  I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship,
[75.24 --> 81.04]  yet because of your shameless audacity, he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.
[81.84 --> 85.32]  So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you.
[86.06 --> 87.72]  Seek, and you will find.
[88.16 --> 90.24]  Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
[90.32 --> 92.20]  For everyone who asks receives.
[92.70 --> 96.48]  Those who seek find, and those who knock, the door will be opened.
[96.48 --> 101.40]  Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?
[101.96 --> 104.12]  Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
[104.82 --> 108.52]  If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
[109.04 --> 114.26]  how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?
[114.26 --> 125.48]  Well, a number of years ago now, I got to know this young guy who lived near me at the time.
[126.56 --> 129.84]  And when I met him, he was going through some challenges with work and also his health.
[129.94 --> 132.66]  In fact, shortly after I met him, he was admitted to a hospital,
[132.66 --> 134.80]  and he fired me a text saying, hey, I'm in the hospital.
[134.90 --> 135.56]  I'd love for you to visit.
[136.32 --> 139.82]  So I went to visit him, and when I got there, I realized, as he shared with me,
[139.88 --> 142.16]  that I'm the only one who knew he was there.
[142.90 --> 144.10]  And that was a strange thing.
[144.16 --> 148.18]  And he then went on to share the brokenness in his family, some of the strange relationships.
[149.12 --> 151.56]  And I thought, it's not right that I'm the only one who knows this.
[151.60 --> 155.04]  And so I said, you know, can we contact a family member, and then I'm just going to let him know.
[155.64 --> 157.88]  Long story short, I get on the phone.
[158.12 --> 159.02]  I call his dad.
[159.48 --> 162.32]  And the plan was, if his dad picked up, I'll explain the situation,
[162.48 --> 163.50]  and then he and his dad will talk.
[163.58 --> 164.64]  They haven't talked in years.
[165.26 --> 165.88]  And so I did that.
[165.94 --> 166.58]  His dad picked up.
[166.64 --> 167.54]  I explained the situation.
[167.66 --> 169.18]  His dad was so happy to talk to his son.
[169.22 --> 171.56]  And I handed the phone to his son in the hospital room
[171.56 --> 175.74]  and got to witness these two people talk for the first time in many years.
[175.78 --> 179.78]  There's a beautiful moment where I just remember, like, the gift of seeing this guy talk to his dad.
[181.08 --> 185.00]  Now, I share this story about the hospital room because I think it represents, at least for me,
[185.44 --> 187.70]  the way many of our prayer lives operate.
[188.34 --> 188.58]  Right?
[188.60 --> 189.80]  We have a heavenly father.
[189.80 --> 192.34]  We know he's there somewhere.
[192.94 --> 194.60]  But we do not talk with him.
[195.40 --> 197.06]  We don't have conversation with him.
[197.12 --> 200.74]  In fact, if we're honest, we wouldn't even know what to say with him if we do talk with him
[200.74 --> 203.82]  because things are just awkward and distant and cold.
[204.46 --> 208.86]  And it's not until a crisis, right, that you pick up the phone and you call
[208.86 --> 213.94]  and maybe are surprised to discover that he actually is there and he does want to talk.
[213.94 --> 218.74]  Interestingly, this past week, I was listening to the radio in our vehicle
[218.74 --> 222.20]  and I heard a song that I just couldn't help but notice as it relates to this sermon.
[222.62 --> 225.20]  It's by a band with the worst name called Jelly Roll.
[225.74 --> 226.92]  And you've probably heard this song.
[227.04 --> 229.54]  It says, I only talk to God when I need a favor.
[229.88 --> 230.28]  You know it?
[230.34 --> 230.84]  You hearing it?
[231.34 --> 235.40]  And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer, but I need a favor.
[235.90 --> 236.44]  That's the song.
[236.50 --> 237.40]  I got one nod over there.
[237.44 --> 238.60]  One other person heard that song.
[239.08 --> 240.52]  And I think that captures it from many of us.
[240.52 --> 243.24]  We only call the Lord, so to speak, when we've got a favor.
[243.74 --> 248.14]  And we're surprised to find out, like that guy in the hospital room, that he's ready to talk.
[248.94 --> 250.54]  He's ready to have a conversation.
[251.96 --> 257.72]  Now, one of the most mysterious and most beautiful dimensions of the Christian life, in my opinion, is prayer.
[258.72 --> 259.58]  And it is mysterious.
[259.82 --> 260.62]  And it is beautiful.
[260.74 --> 264.94]  Like the fact that we have a God who not only created this world and created us,
[264.94 --> 270.20]  but he is a relational God that wants you to know him and you to be known by him,
[270.32 --> 276.54]  who listens to your prayers and speaks to you by his word through creation and verbally in prayer.
[277.56 --> 278.56]  That's the God we worship.
[278.64 --> 282.08]  And if you know anyone who's come to faith and you have the privilege of praying with them,
[282.16 --> 285.68]  one of my favorite things to do is just hear new believers learn prayer.
[286.86 --> 288.40]  Eugene Peterson, one of my favorite writers,
[288.40 --> 292.84]  he describes prayer as the most important thing we can teach people to do in the church.
[293.76 --> 296.86]  He describes prayer as the language of Christianity.
[297.28 --> 301.98]  That is to say, if you are a Christian, you must learn this new language where you talk with your heavenly father
[301.98 --> 306.02]  and listen to him and build relationship with him.
[306.52 --> 310.86]  And the reason he says it's the most important thing we can teach people to do in the church
[310.86 --> 314.06]  is because we're created to do that.
[314.78 --> 315.48]  I mean, think about this.
[315.48 --> 319.50]  This runs quite deep if you let it, that you were created to be an ongoing,
[319.80 --> 322.58]  unbroken conversation and relationship with your heavenly father.
[323.22 --> 327.02]  And it's actually abnormal that we don't speak with him regularly
[327.02 --> 330.26]  or we feel like it's this strange part of our already busy lives
[330.26 --> 331.82]  that we don't really attend to this relationship,
[332.12 --> 336.42]  but it's actually the most human thing in the world to speak to your father.
[337.32 --> 340.44]  And to pray is to recover the fullness of your humanity.
[340.44 --> 345.50]  That is to say, those who don't pray are resisting the fullness of humanity
[345.50 --> 350.74]  because they don't yet know what it's like to be in conversation with the living God.
[350.74 --> 356.00]  This morning we're going to listen to Jesus teach us about prayer.
[357.16 --> 361.44]  Something he knows a lot about, something he actually in the Gospel of Luke is prioritizing.
[361.58 --> 364.72]  Often we read that Jesus goes off by himself to a solitary place
[364.72 --> 369.92]  and he comes out of that solitary place full of the power of God to do the ministry he does.
[370.34 --> 374.28]  And when Jesus' disciples say, teach us to pray, he's like, I want to teach you to pray.
[374.28 --> 379.62]  And this morning we're actually not going to look at the first part of this passage,
[379.76 --> 381.48]  which is what people call the Lord's Prayer.
[381.80 --> 384.70]  We're going to look at the second two parts where Jesus gives a story
[384.70 --> 387.94]  and where Jesus gives a really deep teaching on the character of the Father.
[388.64 --> 391.20]  And this passage in a nutshell is on the one hand,
[391.54 --> 395.30]  Jesus inviting us to humble, persistent, bold prayer.
[395.74 --> 398.20]  And on the other side, Jesus saying, when you do that,
[398.26 --> 400.32]  you're going to discover you have a faithful father.
[400.32 --> 404.88]  Father, he listens, he responds, he provides.
[405.50 --> 406.88]  That's our passage in a nutshell.
[408.12 --> 411.28]  So let's look first at verse 5 where Jesus gives a story.
[411.40 --> 412.48]  I think we'll have it on the screen.
[412.56 --> 412.98]  There we go.
[413.90 --> 416.22]  Jesus invites his disciples to imagine a certain scene
[416.22 --> 418.06]  that would be more common for them than for us,
[418.46 --> 421.12]  probably more common for cultures of high hospitality.
[421.40 --> 423.94]  But he says, I want you to imagine that you have a friend
[423.94 --> 425.62]  who comes to you in the middle of the night
[425.62 --> 428.10]  and it's your responsibility to provide food for them,
[428.38 --> 429.18]  but you don't have any.
[429.18 --> 432.60]  So you go to your friend, you knock on his door
[432.60 --> 435.38]  and ask if he's got bread that he can provide you
[435.38 --> 436.44]  so you can host your guests.
[436.50 --> 437.36]  That's the situation.
[438.36 --> 439.62]  And to a Middle Eastern mind,
[439.78 --> 441.14]  this situation would be unthinkable.
[441.24 --> 442.22]  Like if you knock on someone's door,
[442.30 --> 443.18]  they're going to give you the bread.
[443.26 --> 443.90]  That's what you do.
[444.02 --> 445.46]  You feed your guests.
[445.96 --> 447.30]  I shared this in the 9 a.m. service,
[447.42 --> 450.24]  but I remember my very first time dropping someone off
[450.24 --> 452.28]  at the home of a Nigerian family.
[452.78 --> 453.76]  It was at 10 p.m.
[453.76 --> 454.80]  This is when I was a youth pastor.
[455.20 --> 456.50]  And the mom comes outside.
[456.78 --> 457.52]  She invites me in.
[457.52 --> 458.50]  She's like, we're having dinner.
[458.58 --> 459.76]  I'm like, it's 10 p.m.
[459.84 --> 460.98]  I'm ready to go to bed.
[461.20 --> 462.44]  She's like, no, no, we're having a meal.
[462.58 --> 464.76]  That's hospitality like the Middle East right there.
[465.22 --> 467.44]  So it would be unthinkable for them to say no.
[468.08 --> 469.76]  But the purpose of the story, Jesus says,
[469.84 --> 470.86]  but you're going to keep knocking.
[470.98 --> 472.92]  Your bold, shameless audacity,
[473.16 --> 473.94]  you're going to knock on the door
[473.94 --> 476.66]  and you know that friend is going to open the door,
[476.86 --> 477.94]  not just because of friendship,
[478.38 --> 479.72]  but because you've been so persistent
[479.72 --> 480.54]  in knocking on the door,
[480.78 --> 482.36]  he will provide you with what you need.
[482.36 --> 486.06]  And the message of this small teaching here
[486.06 --> 486.92]  is Jesus saying,
[487.34 --> 489.62]  if that's what a friend of yours will do,
[489.96 --> 493.68]  how much more will God do that in response to prayer?
[494.56 --> 495.62]  In fact, let me read for you a quote.
[495.72 --> 496.86]  It comes from Charles Talbert,
[497.08 --> 498.46]  commentator on the Gospel of Luke.
[498.78 --> 499.58]  This is what he writes,
[499.62 --> 500.86]  and it just summarizes it perfectly.
[501.00 --> 501.38]  He says,
[501.38 --> 522.40]  Did you hear that?
[522.48 --> 525.38]  God wants to answer prayer.
[525.38 --> 527.56]  And it must be noted, by the way,
[527.90 --> 530.08]  that the way Jesus describes God in this story
[530.08 --> 531.94]  is a friend.
[533.24 --> 533.96]  Think about that.
[534.50 --> 536.48]  God is not in some orbit way out there.
[536.58 --> 537.72]  He's very close by.
[537.82 --> 538.78]  He's on the other side of the door.
[538.86 --> 541.06]  He's ready to answer your request.
[542.60 --> 543.46]  And as I said,
[543.52 --> 545.40]  this story picks up two major dimensions of prayer.
[545.52 --> 546.72]  One, bold, persistent,
[547.06 --> 549.50]  even shameless requesting of the Lord
[549.50 --> 550.94]  what it is that you need,
[551.08 --> 552.64]  the heart, your pains, your desires.
[552.90 --> 554.44]  And the other is the character of God
[554.44 --> 555.42]  who is ready to answer,
[555.86 --> 558.38]  responsive in his care and love for your needs.
[559.38 --> 561.36]  And before I open up either of those anymore,
[561.46 --> 562.54]  I want to name the reality
[562.54 --> 563.58]  that you're probably all feeling.
[563.94 --> 566.24]  At least I feel, even as a pastor.
[567.34 --> 569.02]  Prayer is hard.
[569.56 --> 570.38]  Do you feel that?
[571.60 --> 573.86]  Prayer for many of us is difficult.
[574.52 --> 575.76]  It's hard to squeeze in.
[575.88 --> 577.32]  We're fair weather at best.
[577.38 --> 578.18]  It comes, it goes.
[578.26 --> 579.26]  We feel guilty about it.
[579.44 --> 580.66]  We wish we were better at it.
[580.72 --> 581.74]  Am I relating to you here?
[582.20 --> 583.40]  This is true for pastors too.
[583.40 --> 584.84]  We're just as human as everyone else
[584.84 --> 586.72]  in our lives and our prayer lives.
[587.06 --> 589.44]  And I want to name three specific ways
[589.44 --> 591.34]  or three specific things
[591.34 --> 592.44]  that I think make prayer difficult.
[592.52 --> 593.36]  You ready for the first one?
[595.18 --> 598.04]  This invention of profound distraction.
[599.32 --> 601.56]  Now, in years past, before phones,
[601.74 --> 602.34]  many Christians,
[602.48 --> 604.96]  the first thing they do when they get up is pray.
[605.62 --> 606.86]  Or before they go to bed,
[606.92 --> 607.68]  they do their prayers.
[607.92 --> 609.64]  What's the first thing that almost all of us do
[609.64 --> 610.40]  when we get out of bed?
[610.40 --> 612.34]  Then, confession time, hope.
[612.42 --> 613.50]  What's the first thing you do
[613.50 --> 614.32]  when you get out of bed?
[614.56 --> 615.56]  You check your phone.
[615.64 --> 616.96]  Oh, I got one person saying they don't.
[617.06 --> 617.58]  Bless you.
[619.96 --> 621.20]  It's a distraction machine.
[622.08 --> 623.78]  And that makes prayer very difficult
[623.78 --> 625.88]  because it fills the gaps of all the time
[625.88 --> 627.44]  that we could spend praying, right?
[627.90 --> 628.80]  And you know what it's like.
[628.86 --> 629.50]  You pick up your phone,
[629.60 --> 630.32]  you want to check the weather,
[630.40 --> 631.70]  and all of a sudden you're looking at cat videos
[631.70 --> 632.10]  on TikTok
[632.10 --> 633.38]  and wondering why you're wasting
[633.38 --> 634.16]  your whole life away.
[634.24 --> 635.06]  It's painful.
[635.06 --> 637.04]  Secondly,
[637.38 --> 640.16]  this is a reality for all of us as well.
[640.40 --> 641.18]  If I were to ask you
[641.18 --> 642.32]  in regular conversation
[642.32 --> 643.16]  what makes prayer difficult,
[643.26 --> 644.40]  you'd probably say what I would say.
[644.52 --> 644.72]  It's,
[645.22 --> 646.42]  I am busy.
[647.48 --> 649.00]  My life is full.
[649.56 --> 651.70]  It's hard to find the time to pray.
[652.52 --> 654.18]  And I don't want to overstate this point.
[654.88 --> 656.38]  Prayer and hurry
[656.38 --> 658.30]  are at odds with one another.
[658.82 --> 659.66]  In fact, it's the same
[659.66 --> 660.48]  of all your relationships.
[660.64 --> 662.02]  I can't be close to my wife
[662.02 --> 663.98]  if I'm constantly racing through my day.
[663.98 --> 665.52]  I can't be close to my kids
[665.52 --> 666.90]  if I'm constantly racing through my day.
[667.08 --> 668.46]  I can't be close to my friends
[668.46 --> 670.30]  if I'm constantly racing through the day.
[670.54 --> 671.36]  And the same is true
[671.36 --> 672.46]  of your relationship with the Lord.
[672.94 --> 674.38]  If you are constantly running,
[674.44 --> 675.36]  you've got no margin,
[675.48 --> 676.92]  you don't have a pace that is healthy,
[677.32 --> 678.96]  you can't be a person of prayer.
[679.74 --> 681.92]  Hurry is hostile to Christianity.
[683.22 --> 684.40]  I made this quote earlier
[684.40 --> 685.40]  in the first service
[685.40 --> 686.66]  and someone corrected who it's from.
[687.00 --> 688.48]  I thought it was from Dallas Willard.
[688.60 --> 689.78]  It probably isn't,
[689.84 --> 690.82]  so this is your research
[690.82 --> 692.04]  when you go home who said this.
[692.04 --> 694.10]  But a Christian leader was asked,
[694.32 --> 695.00]  what is the thing
[695.00 --> 696.30]  that believers need to recover
[696.30 --> 697.94]  to have a full life in Christ?
[698.04 --> 700.52]  And the answer they gave is this.
[701.32 --> 704.90]  Ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life.
[705.74 --> 707.22]  Because if you are hurrying,
[707.38 --> 708.86]  you cannot give yourself to prayer.
[708.92 --> 710.42]  And you know how impossible it is
[710.42 --> 712.72]  to really pray when you're in a rush.
[713.24 --> 715.02]  And the sad reality is
[715.02 --> 716.30]  the pace of our culture
[716.30 --> 718.22]  is so much faster than we even realize.
[718.22 --> 719.80]  It's so much more unhealthy
[719.80 --> 721.38]  than we even know.
[722.58 --> 724.58]  Third reason that we don't pray
[724.58 --> 726.06]  is straight up,
[726.10 --> 726.72]  I'm going to be honest with you,
[726.74 --> 727.52]  it's because we're proud.
[729.12 --> 729.92]  I think many of us,
[730.02 --> 732.50]  we don't want to bring our request to God
[732.50 --> 733.98]  because, well, what if He says something?
[734.06 --> 735.74]  What if He starts meddling with my plans?
[735.92 --> 737.10]  And I like my ideas
[737.10 --> 738.40]  and I like my vision for my future.
[738.50 --> 739.80]  I don't want God saying no
[739.80 --> 741.70]  or giving me something I don't want to do.
[742.38 --> 743.42]  And so we'd rather say,
[743.50 --> 744.38]  I've got a plan for my life
[744.38 --> 744.98]  that I'm going to follow
[744.98 --> 746.36]  and I'm just not going to ask God.
[747.34 --> 748.52]  And two terrible assumptions
[748.52 --> 750.26]  under the hood of that perception,
[750.38 --> 750.72]  by the way,
[750.74 --> 751.32]  are number one,
[751.66 --> 753.50]  you think you know what's best for your life.
[754.16 --> 755.24]  That's probably not true.
[755.36 --> 755.82]  Number two,
[756.14 --> 757.54]  God's some cosmic killjoy
[757.54 --> 758.54]  who's going to wreck your life
[758.54 --> 760.10]  if you bring things to Him
[760.10 --> 761.38]  and ask for His provision,
[761.54 --> 762.04]  His wisdom,
[762.34 --> 762.84]  His input.
[763.42 --> 766.02]  That is not how Jesus in this passage
[766.02 --> 767.60]  describes the character of the Father
[767.60 --> 769.14]  who is a good Father
[769.14 --> 770.16]  who gives good gifts
[770.16 --> 772.10]  and provides for the children He loves.
[772.10 --> 774.36]  And it seems to me
[774.36 --> 775.38]  before I can even talk
[775.38 --> 777.36]  about like this persistent kind of prayer,
[777.78 --> 779.22]  I want to invite us into repentance.
[780.18 --> 780.98]  We've got to repent
[780.98 --> 782.92]  of our distraction to phones.
[784.02 --> 785.76]  And you can talk to Brayden, by the way.
[785.82 --> 786.52]  There's a few of us
[786.52 --> 787.86]  who have done this thing called dumb phoning.
[788.40 --> 789.66]  And basically it's just limiting
[789.66 --> 790.64]  what phones can do
[790.64 --> 791.82]  and how often you use them.
[792.00 --> 793.26]  And that's often the first step
[793.26 --> 794.76]  towards having the space
[794.76 --> 795.86]  to develop a prayer life.
[795.88 --> 797.10]  But we need to repent of our hurry.
[797.90 --> 799.24]  Not just for the sake of our prayer,
[799.32 --> 800.32]  but for the sake of our families,
[800.32 --> 801.86]  our friendships, and our wholeness
[801.86 --> 803.16]  and our formation in Christ.
[803.70 --> 805.48]  And finally we need to repent of our pride.
[806.44 --> 808.60]  We do not know how to run our lives.
[809.40 --> 812.80]  You do not know how best to live tomorrow.
[813.54 --> 815.06]  But your Father in Heaven does.
[815.52 --> 817.14]  And He's ready to share with you
[817.14 --> 818.56]  and reveal to you
[818.56 --> 820.78]  His wisdom, His love, and His direction.
[822.36 --> 823.40]  So in light of that,
[823.46 --> 824.34]  I want to now say
[824.34 --> 826.32]  what Jesus is inviting us into
[826.32 --> 829.00]  is one persistent, humble prayer.
[829.00 --> 830.24]  And then He talks about
[830.24 --> 831.08]  the character of the Father.
[831.42 --> 833.38]  This passage is inviting us
[833.38 --> 834.50]  to shameless prayer.
[835.26 --> 835.68]  It's saying,
[835.80 --> 838.24]  God, this is what I need
[838.24 --> 840.40]  and I'm not afraid to ask you for it.
[840.66 --> 842.02]  I'm not proud over here
[842.02 --> 843.14]  solving my own problems,
[843.30 --> 844.82]  finding a way to get this bread to my friend.
[845.10 --> 846.54]  I need you.
[847.22 --> 848.08]  And I'm not afraid
[848.08 --> 849.96]  to be shamelessly out
[849.96 --> 850.88]  in the middle of the night
[850.88 --> 851.72]  knocking on the door
[851.72 --> 852.56]  because I trust
[852.56 --> 853.90]  that this is worth it,
[854.04 --> 854.70]  that you care,
[854.78 --> 855.84]  and that you're going to open the door.
[856.58 --> 858.08]  This is not some self-made person
[858.08 --> 858.72]  knocking on the door.
[858.78 --> 860.66]  This is a humble person
[860.66 --> 862.60]  who knows they have need
[862.60 --> 864.34]  and they know God cares.
[864.86 --> 865.94]  So they knock patiently,
[866.68 --> 868.22]  boldly, persistently,
[868.28 --> 870.10]  and even shamelessly
[870.10 --> 871.94]  on the door of prayer.
[873.78 --> 874.76]  Over my sabbatical,
[874.82 --> 876.14]  I read a few books on prayer
[876.14 --> 877.00]  and in one of them,
[877.06 --> 877.68]  I read a story
[877.68 --> 879.24]  about a man named D.L. Moody.
[879.76 --> 880.72]  Some of you might know him,
[880.80 --> 881.54]  many of you might not.
[882.06 --> 883.82]  D.L. Moody grew up
[883.82 --> 885.48]  in the 18th century or 19th century.
[886.02 --> 887.36]  He was a shoe salesman
[887.36 --> 888.62]  with a fifth grade education
[888.62 --> 890.42]  who became one of the most
[890.42 --> 891.66]  well-known evangelists
[891.66 --> 893.60]  and preachers of the 19th century.
[894.58 --> 896.68]  And his entire strategy
[896.68 --> 897.34]  for ministry,
[897.72 --> 899.44]  of preaching and church growth
[899.44 --> 900.12]  and all the rest
[900.12 --> 901.14]  was just pray.
[902.56 --> 904.32]  Pray for the power of God
[904.32 --> 906.54]  to show up in powerful ways.
[907.90 --> 908.56]  And what I learned
[908.56 --> 909.60]  as I read about D.L. Moody
[909.60 --> 910.64]  is that in his pocket,
[910.98 --> 911.68]  throughout the entirety
[911.68 --> 912.54]  of his adult life,
[912.98 --> 913.90]  he had a sheet of paper.
[914.10 --> 914.98]  And on that sheet of paper
[914.98 --> 917.34]  were the names of 100 people,
[917.86 --> 919.36]  family members, friends,
[919.74 --> 920.66]  people he knew well,
[920.92 --> 922.14]  who did not yet know Christ.
[922.24 --> 923.42]  And he was praying daily
[923.42 --> 925.14]  by name through that list
[925.14 --> 926.26]  of people on the sheet
[926.26 --> 928.18]  that God would reveal himself
[928.18 --> 929.64]  in such a way
[929.64 --> 930.70]  that they turned their lives
[930.70 --> 931.74]  to the gospel of Jesus.
[932.76 --> 933.36]  Now, I read that
[933.36 --> 934.52]  when D.L. Moody died,
[934.84 --> 936.26]  96 of those people
[936.26 --> 937.50]  became Christians,
[937.50 --> 940.24]  some of whom
[940.24 --> 941.80]  at his funeral.
[942.26 --> 943.16]  As people shared
[943.16 --> 944.28]  about D.L. Moody's faith,
[944.44 --> 945.28]  as they shared stories
[945.28 --> 945.94]  of what God did
[945.94 --> 947.04]  in and through his ministry,
[947.18 --> 947.60]  they said,
[947.96 --> 948.60]  I believe.
[949.52 --> 950.90]  And that was in response
[950.90 --> 952.46]  to a lifetime
[952.46 --> 953.98]  of daily prayer
[953.98 --> 955.94]  of people by name
[955.94 --> 957.12]  for conversion.
[958.14 --> 958.64]  And I don't know
[958.64 --> 959.46]  how that story sits with you.
[959.52 --> 960.18]  Maybe it makes you think,
[960.24 --> 961.12]  oh, I gotta start this
[961.12 --> 961.42]  or whatever,
[961.50 --> 962.18]  but it makes me
[962.18 --> 963.50]  get imaginative.
[963.74 --> 964.84]  Because what I imagine is,
[964.92 --> 965.68]  imagine we had
[965.68 --> 966.36]  in our pockets,
[966.70 --> 967.46]  little sheets of paper.
[967.68 --> 968.50]  Doesn't even need
[968.50 --> 969.36]  to be 100 people.
[969.46 --> 970.08]  We'll take 10.
[970.40 --> 971.20]  Or, even better,
[971.30 --> 972.46]  you get TikTok off your phone,
[972.58 --> 973.56]  get Instagram off your phone,
[973.64 --> 974.58]  get Facebook off your phone,
[974.88 --> 975.70]  recover your life,
[975.84 --> 976.54]  and then have a note
[976.54 --> 977.16]  on your phone
[977.16 --> 978.26]  where you write down
[978.26 --> 978.80]  the names of people
[978.80 --> 979.50]  you wanna pray for
[979.50 --> 980.14]  every morning.
[980.24 --> 981.16]  That's the first thing you do.
[981.96 --> 982.32]  Imagine,
[983.44 --> 984.74]  imagine with me
[984.74 --> 985.50]  what people
[985.50 --> 986.94]  in 35 years from now
[986.94 --> 987.96]  here at Hope Community Church
[987.96 --> 988.90]  might be celebrating
[988.90 --> 990.60]  and praising the Lord for
[990.60 --> 991.68]  because of the seeds
[991.68 --> 992.40]  of prayer
[992.40 --> 993.64]  we are planting now
[993.64 --> 994.12]  in patient,
[994.28 --> 994.54]  faithful,
[994.68 --> 994.88]  humble,
[995.00 --> 995.36]  persistence.
[995.68 --> 996.78]  Have I percolated
[996.78 --> 997.34]  your imagination
[997.34 --> 997.92]  a little bit?
[999.40 --> 1000.24]  Small groups,
[1000.68 --> 1001.44]  great opportunity
[1001.44 --> 1002.64]  to do on a weekly basis.
[1003.06 --> 1003.76]  Married couples,
[1004.04 --> 1004.42]  families,
[1004.74 --> 1005.62]  find a prayer jar,
[1005.80 --> 1006.36]  work your way
[1006.36 --> 1007.04]  through your friends
[1007.04 --> 1007.42]  and families.
[1008.00 --> 1010.04]  Allow God to show you
[1010.04 --> 1011.38]  how he answers prayer.
[1013.14 --> 1014.92]  Test the faithfulness
[1014.92 --> 1016.06]  of God's provision
[1016.06 --> 1017.38]  in patient,
[1017.56 --> 1017.78]  humble,
[1017.98 --> 1018.94]  persistent prayer.
[1022.00 --> 1022.48]  Now,
[1022.52 --> 1023.14]  it seems to me
[1023.14 --> 1023.92]  that if we really
[1023.92 --> 1024.64]  wanna give ourselves
[1024.64 --> 1025.04]  to prayer,
[1025.04 --> 1025.62]  we have to have
[1025.62 --> 1026.82]  a measure of trust
[1026.82 --> 1028.32]  that there is a person
[1028.32 --> 1029.12]  on the other side
[1029.12 --> 1029.60]  of the door
[1029.60 --> 1030.58]  who loves
[1030.58 --> 1031.56]  and cares for us
[1031.56 --> 1032.34]  and he actually
[1032.34 --> 1033.84]  seeks to open
[1033.84 --> 1034.36]  the door
[1034.36 --> 1035.22]  and answer prayer.
[1035.70 --> 1036.46]  And that's what Jesus
[1036.46 --> 1037.54]  actually focuses on
[1037.54 --> 1038.32]  in this passage.
[1038.68 --> 1039.16]  A lot of times
[1039.16 --> 1039.90]  we focus on like
[1039.90 --> 1040.34]  the asking,
[1040.54 --> 1040.88]  the seeking,
[1041.02 --> 1041.40]  the knocking,
[1041.74 --> 1042.74]  but behind every one
[1042.74 --> 1043.24]  of those statements
[1043.24 --> 1043.66]  he says,
[1043.86 --> 1044.20]  ask
[1044.20 --> 1046.18]  and you'll receive.
[1046.74 --> 1047.00]  Seek
[1047.00 --> 1047.84]  and you'll find.
[1048.02 --> 1048.28]  Knock
[1048.28 --> 1048.88]  and the door
[1048.88 --> 1050.12]  will be open to you
[1050.12 --> 1051.14]  for everyone who asks,
[1051.48 --> 1051.82]  receives.
[1051.98 --> 1052.80]  All those who seek,
[1052.90 --> 1053.10]  find.
[1053.10 --> 1054.06]  All those who knock,
[1054.34 --> 1055.20]  the door is open.
[1055.32 --> 1056.40]  Jesus is getting repetitive
[1056.40 --> 1057.44]  about the character
[1057.44 --> 1057.98]  of the Father.
[1058.82 --> 1059.78]  But I now wanna read
[1059.78 --> 1060.70]  how Jesus finishes
[1060.70 --> 1062.08]  because he sort of
[1062.08 --> 1063.48]  directs right attention
[1063.48 --> 1064.18]  to the dads
[1064.18 --> 1064.94]  as a way of saying,
[1065.24 --> 1066.76]  this is who God is
[1066.76 --> 1067.80]  when you pray.
[1069.68 --> 1070.32]  He says,
[1070.40 --> 1070.64]  you know,
[1071.00 --> 1072.08]  which of you fathers,
[1072.84 --> 1073.76]  which of you fathers,
[1073.82 --> 1074.40]  if your son asks
[1074.40 --> 1074.80]  for a fish,
[1074.84 --> 1075.20]  will give him
[1075.20 --> 1075.98]  a snake instead?
[1076.90 --> 1077.62]  Or if he asks
[1077.62 --> 1078.04]  for an egg,
[1078.08 --> 1078.44]  will give him
[1078.44 --> 1079.08]  a scorpion?
[1079.14 --> 1079.76]  What a terrible thing
[1079.76 --> 1080.06]  to do.
[1080.84 --> 1081.52]  If you then,
[1081.60 --> 1082.22]  though you are evil,
[1082.32 --> 1082.94]  know how to give
[1082.94 --> 1083.50]  good gifts
[1083.50 --> 1084.08]  to your children,
[1084.34 --> 1085.72]  how much more
[1085.72 --> 1086.94]  will the Father
[1086.94 --> 1087.98]  give the Holy Spirit
[1087.98 --> 1089.54]  to those who ask him?
[1090.90 --> 1091.34]  And he's saying,
[1091.40 --> 1092.30]  it's such a simple teaching.
[1092.40 --> 1093.04]  If you're a dad,
[1093.10 --> 1093.70]  and we have lots
[1093.70 --> 1094.16]  of good dads
[1094.16 --> 1094.76]  in our church
[1094.76 --> 1096.44]  who will give anything
[1096.44 --> 1097.14]  for their kids
[1097.14 --> 1097.82]  to care for them,
[1097.88 --> 1098.48]  provide for them,
[1098.74 --> 1099.44]  raise them well.
[1099.56 --> 1100.82]  Parents get this instinct
[1100.82 --> 1101.64]  to care for kids.
[1101.98 --> 1102.64]  And Jesus is saying,
[1102.74 --> 1103.68]  if you know how to give
[1103.68 --> 1104.72]  good gifts to your kids,
[1105.44 --> 1106.22]  don't you think
[1106.22 --> 1107.06]  your heavenly Father
[1107.06 --> 1107.90]  does too?
[1107.90 --> 1110.04]  Interestingly,
[1110.66 --> 1111.52]  if you read this story
[1111.52 --> 1112.68]  in the Gospel of Matthew,
[1112.90 --> 1113.48]  Matthew says,
[1113.68 --> 1114.22]  how much more
[1114.22 --> 1114.74]  will your Father
[1114.74 --> 1115.62]  give good gifts
[1115.62 --> 1116.64]  to those who ask him?
[1116.86 --> 1117.54]  And Luke says,
[1117.74 --> 1118.32]  how much more
[1118.32 --> 1118.88]  will your Father
[1118.88 --> 1119.86]  in heaven give what?
[1120.80 --> 1122.26]  The Holy Spirit
[1122.26 --> 1124.06]  to those who ask him.
[1124.44 --> 1124.94]  Matthew's saying,
[1125.00 --> 1125.60]  he's going to provide
[1125.60 --> 1125.90]  for you,
[1125.96 --> 1126.74]  he knows your needs,
[1126.88 --> 1127.70]  he's going to be there
[1127.70 --> 1128.70]  with the very specific
[1128.70 --> 1129.76]  things you're asking for.
[1129.96 --> 1130.54]  And Luke says,
[1130.64 --> 1131.64]  he'll do you one better.
[1132.58 --> 1134.10]  He will give you himself.
[1134.10 --> 1136.94]  He will pour out
[1136.94 --> 1138.38]  his Holy Spirit
[1138.38 --> 1139.60]  on you.
[1140.60 --> 1141.30]  And it just so happened
[1141.30 --> 1141.86]  that this week,
[1142.38 --> 1143.12]  I had someone visit me
[1143.12 --> 1143.70]  in my office
[1143.70 --> 1144.44]  and we were talking
[1144.44 --> 1145.04]  about prayer
[1145.04 --> 1146.04]  and they said to me,
[1146.10 --> 1146.30]  you know,
[1146.38 --> 1147.98]  we just don't talk enough
[1147.98 --> 1149.96]  and dwell enough
[1149.96 --> 1151.06]  on the gift
[1151.06 --> 1152.00]  of the Holy Spirit.
[1152.56 --> 1153.42]  We often talk about
[1153.42 --> 1154.16]  God as sovereign,
[1154.28 --> 1154.98]  we talk about Jesus
[1154.98 --> 1155.70]  as our redeemer
[1155.70 --> 1156.68]  and we say very little
[1156.68 --> 1157.52]  but the Holy Spirit.
[1157.86 --> 1158.72]  And what a tragedy
[1158.72 --> 1160.00]  because Jesus says,
[1160.10 --> 1160.70]  it's better for me
[1160.70 --> 1161.32]  to go to heaven
[1161.32 --> 1162.42]  after my ascension
[1162.42 --> 1162.96]  and resurrection
[1162.96 --> 1164.46]  so that you can receive
[1164.46 --> 1164.98]  the Spirit.
[1165.44 --> 1166.10]  Because when Jesus
[1166.10 --> 1166.90]  gives us the Spirit,
[1167.14 --> 1167.94]  he gives us the very
[1167.94 --> 1169.56]  indwelling power
[1169.56 --> 1171.80]  and presence of God.
[1173.34 --> 1174.60]  Not just up there,
[1175.10 --> 1175.62]  in here.
[1175.78 --> 1176.60]  Even as we worship,
[1176.72 --> 1178.04]  the Spirit is among us.
[1178.12 --> 1178.52]  Even more,
[1178.58 --> 1180.60]  the Spirit is within you.
[1181.40 --> 1182.86]  The Spirit groans with you,
[1182.94 --> 1184.18]  the Spirit grieves your pain,
[1184.28 --> 1185.36]  the Spirit knows your sorrow
[1185.36 --> 1186.54]  and joys with you
[1186.54 --> 1187.28]  in your celebration.
[1187.58 --> 1188.22]  When you pray,
[1188.48 --> 1189.82]  the Spirit is at work
[1189.82 --> 1190.86]  within you
[1190.86 --> 1192.90]  to know how to pray,
[1193.48 --> 1194.54]  to soften your heart
[1194.54 --> 1195.10]  to the Scriptures,
[1195.26 --> 1196.32]  to lead you to repentance
[1196.32 --> 1197.34]  so that you know
[1197.34 --> 1198.34]  the love of the Father.
[1198.92 --> 1199.46]  And I've shared this
[1199.46 --> 1200.24]  many times before.
[1200.32 --> 1201.30]  One of my favorite passages
[1201.30 --> 1202.08]  in the Bible
[1202.08 --> 1203.32]  is that when you receive
[1203.32 --> 1203.70]  the Spirit,
[1203.78 --> 1205.02]  you receive the love of God.
[1205.76 --> 1206.68]  Romans 5.5 says,
[1206.80 --> 1207.72]  for the love of God
[1207.72 --> 1208.46]  has been poured
[1208.46 --> 1209.66]  into our hearts
[1209.66 --> 1211.12]  through the Holy Spirit.
[1212.04 --> 1212.72]  And I'm convinced
[1212.72 --> 1213.58]  that people who give
[1213.58 --> 1214.36]  themselves to pray,
[1214.62 --> 1215.42]  one of the things
[1215.42 --> 1216.48]  they can be assured of
[1216.48 --> 1217.86]  is they will feel
[1217.86 --> 1219.12]  and experience
[1219.12 --> 1220.54]  the love of their Father.
[1221.66 --> 1222.82]  Even in the hardest seasons,
[1223.42 --> 1223.84]  even in the most
[1223.84 --> 1225.08]  frustrating circumstances,
[1225.22 --> 1225.96]  they will know
[1225.96 --> 1228.50]  the love of their Father
[1228.50 --> 1229.30]  through the Spirit.
[1232.18 --> 1233.16]  Now, I mentioned this
[1233.16 --> 1233.64]  with Brayden
[1233.64 --> 1234.28]  in our interview
[1234.28 --> 1235.32]  and I'll say it again,
[1235.42 --> 1236.26]  that one of the great gifts
[1236.26 --> 1236.98]  that I experienced
[1236.98 --> 1238.10]  in my own sabbatical
[1238.10 --> 1239.18]  was prayer.
[1240.28 --> 1241.04]  And like everyone,
[1241.34 --> 1242.76]  I am not gifted,
[1242.92 --> 1243.50]  I would say,
[1243.60 --> 1244.02]  in prayer.
[1244.14 --> 1245.44]  I have a distracted mind.
[1245.94 --> 1247.28]  I have been accused,
[1247.62 --> 1248.54]  and rightfully so,
[1248.54 --> 1249.32]  I have a busy schedule
[1249.32 --> 1250.00]  that squeezes
[1250.00 --> 1250.90]  my prayer life out.
[1251.30 --> 1251.88]  And on my prayer,
[1252.10 --> 1252.86]  or on my sabbatical,
[1252.94 --> 1253.80]  I gave every day
[1253.80 --> 1255.32]  a time for a prayer walk.
[1256.40 --> 1257.12]  And over the time,
[1257.18 --> 1257.80]  every day I did it,
[1257.82 --> 1258.38]  I found myself,
[1258.48 --> 1259.74]  I didn't need to talk as much.
[1259.98 --> 1260.86]  Maybe I ran out of things
[1260.86 --> 1261.72]  to say, I don't know.
[1261.80 --> 1262.98]  But I would slowly,
[1263.14 --> 1264.18]  and probably almost every day,
[1264.28 --> 1264.44]  say,
[1264.54 --> 1266.22]  Lord, I want you to speak to me.
[1266.26 --> 1266.66]  I'm open.
[1266.70 --> 1267.14]  I want to hear
[1267.14 --> 1267.92]  what you have to say.
[1268.68 --> 1270.54]  And I was so encouraged
[1270.54 --> 1271.20]  and moved
[1271.20 --> 1272.36]  by the fact that God
[1272.36 --> 1273.66]  would reveal Scripture to me.
[1273.72 --> 1274.04]  That was probably
[1274.04 --> 1274.98]  the most common thing.
[1275.24 --> 1276.06]  Scriptures would come to me,
[1276.06 --> 1277.24]  some that confronted me
[1277.24 --> 1278.44]  that I didn't want to hear.
[1279.08 --> 1279.92]  The Spirit would sometimes
[1279.92 --> 1280.42]  reveal to me
[1280.42 --> 1281.14]  things I'm seeing
[1281.14 --> 1282.36]  and things I need to pray for.
[1282.56 --> 1283.32]  And sometimes God
[1283.32 --> 1284.40]  would speak very directly to me
[1284.40 --> 1284.88]  about things
[1284.88 --> 1285.74]  that I needed to know.
[1286.22 --> 1286.92]  And there's something
[1286.92 --> 1288.46]  that just changes you
[1288.46 --> 1290.32]  when you experience that.
[1290.78 --> 1291.96]  It just affects you
[1291.96 --> 1293.36]  that there's this God
[1293.36 --> 1294.90]  who is so concerned
[1294.90 --> 1296.18]  about your puny little life
[1296.18 --> 1296.92]  that when you're walking
[1296.92 --> 1298.72]  around 168A Avenue,
[1298.86 --> 1299.44]  He's speaking.
[1299.62 --> 1301.14]  It's just an amazing thing
[1301.14 --> 1303.12]  that we have a generous Father
[1303.12 --> 1304.28]  who's so specific
[1304.28 --> 1305.34]  in His love and His care.
[1305.56 --> 1306.82]  And I need to underscore this.
[1307.78 --> 1309.14]  That was not my experience
[1309.14 --> 1310.12]  because I'm a pastor.
[1311.04 --> 1311.76]  There's many people
[1311.76 --> 1312.20]  in our church
[1312.20 --> 1313.14]  who are more faithful
[1313.14 --> 1313.80]  in their prayer lives
[1313.80 --> 1314.32]  than I am.
[1314.64 --> 1315.44]  And it's not like God
[1315.44 --> 1316.60]  hears Dave Gruden praying
[1316.60 --> 1316.82]  and thinking,
[1316.94 --> 1317.50]  oh, he's a pastor.
[1317.56 --> 1318.26]  I better speak to him.
[1318.46 --> 1319.36]  This is what He does
[1319.36 --> 1320.30]  for His children.
[1321.44 --> 1322.22]  Whether you're a lawyer,
[1322.48 --> 1322.92]  a teacher,
[1323.14 --> 1323.70]  a carpenter,
[1324.10 --> 1324.74]  a bricklayer,
[1324.84 --> 1326.30]  an ICBC lawyer,
[1326.72 --> 1327.94]  God speaks to His children.
[1329.22 --> 1330.20]  Sorry, John Holstein.
[1330.38 --> 1330.94]  You're at the hospital
[1330.94 --> 1331.52]  with your wife.
[1331.82 --> 1332.68]  I had to make a dig
[1332.68 --> 1334.18]  at him being an ICBC lawyer.
[1334.28 --> 1337.86]  But the invitation is simple.
[1338.00 --> 1338.40]  To the oldest,
[1338.56 --> 1338.86]  the youngest,
[1338.98 --> 1339.60]  the newest believer,
[1339.72 --> 1340.62]  the youngest child,
[1340.80 --> 1342.30]  ask, seek, knock.
[1342.78 --> 1344.04]  The generous Father
[1344.04 --> 1344.88]  you have in heaven
[1344.88 --> 1346.82]  who has secured your life
[1346.82 --> 1347.34]  through the cross
[1347.34 --> 1348.18]  of Jesus Christ
[1348.18 --> 1350.78]  will respond as fathers do.
[1352.16 --> 1353.26]  And I want to invite you
[1353.26 --> 1354.46]  as strongly as I can.
[1354.58 --> 1355.16]  Test it out.
[1356.48 --> 1356.78]  Pray.
[1357.74 --> 1358.50]  Pray as a couple.
[1358.68 --> 1359.36]  Pray as a family.
[1359.52 --> 1360.56]  Pray with your small group.
[1361.14 --> 1362.24]  Find a practice of prayer.
[1362.38 --> 1363.64]  Find, as my friend does,
[1363.70 --> 1364.68]  a prayer chair.
[1365.22 --> 1365.82]  And every morning
[1365.82 --> 1366.74]  you plunk yourself down
[1366.74 --> 1367.18]  in that chair,
[1367.24 --> 1367.88]  whether you're tired,
[1368.28 --> 1369.16]  whether you're not happy,
[1369.48 --> 1369.96]  whether you don't feel
[1369.96 --> 1370.60]  like praying or not,
[1370.66 --> 1371.44]  and allow God
[1371.44 --> 1372.62]  to minister to you
[1372.62 --> 1374.04]  and show up
[1374.04 --> 1375.22]  like a good father.
[1377.92 --> 1378.76]  I'm going to finish
[1378.76 --> 1379.78]  with a story.
[1380.12 --> 1380.88]  Actually, not a story.
[1380.98 --> 1381.40]  I'm going to finish
[1381.40 --> 1382.34]  with a hard question.
[1383.14 --> 1384.38]  I couldn't preach on this
[1384.38 --> 1385.52]  without naming something
[1385.52 --> 1386.10]  that I think a lot
[1386.10 --> 1386.78]  of people experience.
[1386.92 --> 1387.80]  And so this is for you.
[1387.86 --> 1388.22]  If you're someone
[1388.22 --> 1389.10]  struggling in your faith,
[1389.38 --> 1390.46]  I felt the need to finish
[1390.46 --> 1391.42]  on this strange one.
[1392.14 --> 1393.30]  I think a few people
[1393.30 --> 1394.14]  look at this passage
[1394.14 --> 1394.62]  and say,
[1394.76 --> 1396.30]  well, I guess there's
[1396.30 --> 1397.28]  something wrong with me
[1397.28 --> 1398.92]  because I've been praying
[1398.92 --> 1399.78]  for a long time
[1399.78 --> 1400.84]  for this diagnosis,
[1401.06 --> 1401.64]  for that job,
[1401.72 --> 1402.54]  for this family member,
[1402.96 --> 1404.16]  and nothing is happening.
[1405.02 --> 1406.42]  Either God doesn't love me,
[1406.66 --> 1407.84]  He's not powerful enough,
[1407.94 --> 1409.16]  or I suck at praying
[1409.16 --> 1409.90]  in some way or another
[1409.90 --> 1411.16]  because this is just exhausting
[1411.16 --> 1412.34]  and I feel empty
[1412.34 --> 1413.68]  as I continue to try
[1413.68 --> 1414.52]  to pray for this thing
[1414.52 --> 1415.94]  year over year over year.
[1416.44 --> 1417.02]  And I want to say
[1417.02 --> 1417.48]  at the outset
[1417.48 --> 1418.52]  that I get that.
[1419.18 --> 1420.10]  Personally, I get that.
[1420.14 --> 1420.72]  The thing I've prayed
[1420.72 --> 1421.96]  for the longest in my life,
[1422.44 --> 1423.44]  for my brother's healing,
[1423.56 --> 1424.64]  he has bipolar depression,
[1425.30 --> 1426.64]  I have not seen that happen.
[1426.76 --> 1427.48]  In fact, things have gotten
[1427.48 --> 1428.72]  only worse recently
[1428.72 --> 1429.10]  and I think,
[1429.20 --> 1429.60]  okay, Lord,
[1429.76 --> 1430.80]  this is what I've been praying
[1430.80 --> 1431.74]  for since I'm nine.
[1431.84 --> 1432.80]  Like, what's the deal?
[1433.80 --> 1434.44]  And I don't want
[1434.44 --> 1435.84]  to soften any edges.
[1435.96 --> 1436.74]  I don't want to even think
[1436.74 --> 1437.90]  that there's a trite answer
[1437.90 --> 1439.28]  for that hard question.
[1439.90 --> 1441.48]  But I do want to point us
[1441.48 --> 1442.34]  to a source of comfort
[1442.34 --> 1443.08]  and hope.
[1443.44 --> 1444.16]  You know what that is?
[1445.06 --> 1446.10]  That the person
[1446.10 --> 1447.88]  who teaches His disciples
[1447.88 --> 1449.24]  this prayer
[1449.24 --> 1451.96]  is someone who in his own life
[1451.96 --> 1454.02]  experienced unanswered prayer.
[1454.72 --> 1455.40]  Did you know that?
[1456.72 --> 1458.04]  Jesus prays to His Father
[1458.04 --> 1460.70]  in His moment of greatest need.
[1461.54 --> 1462.72]  In the Garden of Gethsemane,
[1463.12 --> 1464.26]  shortly before He's handed over
[1464.26 --> 1464.98]  to go to the cross,
[1464.98 --> 1467.06]  Jesus is begging His Father
[1467.06 --> 1468.50]  not to be crucified.
[1469.26 --> 1470.18]  I don't want it, Lord.
[1470.32 --> 1471.98]  I don't want this cup of judgment.
[1472.30 --> 1473.44]  Take it away from me.
[1474.10 --> 1475.64]  And the answer Jesus gets
[1475.64 --> 1477.00]  is no.
[1478.34 --> 1480.64]  And Jesus then goes to the cross.
[1481.74 --> 1483.88]  And here is the marvelous mystery
[1483.88 --> 1485.70]  of Jesus' unanswered prayer.
[1485.80 --> 1486.40]  You know what it is?
[1487.48 --> 1489.00]  That becomes the answer
[1489.00 --> 1491.48]  to generations of prayer.
[1491.48 --> 1494.08]  That becomes God's answer
[1494.08 --> 1495.86]  to generations of groaning
[1495.86 --> 1496.98]  from people
[1496.98 --> 1498.16]  and generation after generation
[1498.16 --> 1499.02]  living in the muck
[1499.02 --> 1500.20]  and pain and mire
[1500.20 --> 1501.02]  and vicious,
[1501.40 --> 1503.34]  divisive pain of sin.
[1504.28 --> 1505.40]  And what God says
[1505.40 --> 1506.36]  in His note to Jesus
[1506.36 --> 1508.04]  is to the rest of the world,
[1508.12 --> 1508.78]  to the rest of people
[1508.78 --> 1509.24]  who are praying,
[1509.52 --> 1510.62]  I have heard your prayers.
[1511.62 --> 1512.92]  And the answer is coming
[1512.92 --> 1514.14]  in the unexpected death
[1514.14 --> 1514.58]  and resurrection
[1514.58 --> 1515.86]  of my own Son
[1515.86 --> 1517.02]  whom I love.
[1518.12 --> 1518.92]  Your redemption,
[1519.70 --> 1520.50]  your healing,
[1520.50 --> 1521.90]  your resurrection
[1521.90 --> 1523.92]  is coming through the cross.
[1524.50 --> 1525.54]  And when Jesus hung,
[1525.94 --> 1526.90]  humiliated,
[1527.32 --> 1528.18]  after He didn't get
[1528.18 --> 1528.94]  His answered prayer,
[1529.56 --> 1530.20]  God says,
[1530.56 --> 1531.94]  I am now accomplishing
[1531.94 --> 1533.78]  and answering your prayer.
[1535.16 --> 1536.42]  Defeating the power of Satan,
[1536.78 --> 1538.12]  the tempter for all of us.
[1538.38 --> 1540.02]  Defeating the power of sin
[1540.02 --> 1541.76]  that is corrupting our desires
[1541.76 --> 1543.04]  and destroying our relationships
[1543.04 --> 1544.44]  and defeating the power of death,
[1545.14 --> 1546.62]  the thing we all have to face
[1546.62 --> 1547.88]  at the end of our lives.
[1547.88 --> 1550.86]  And here's the thing.
[1552.10 --> 1553.02]  Jesus, who experienced
[1553.02 --> 1553.84]  the unanswered prayer,
[1553.98 --> 1554.92]  says to us today,
[1555.86 --> 1557.60]  your day is coming.
[1559.04 --> 1560.56]  Your day of healing is coming.
[1561.20 --> 1562.82]  Your day of restoration is coming.
[1562.90 --> 1564.36]  Your day of answering that prayer
[1564.36 --> 1565.46]  where today you have to
[1565.46 --> 1566.48]  limp along in pain.
[1566.78 --> 1567.84]  Tomorrow you have to experience
[1567.84 --> 1568.96]  all the brokenness of sin.
[1569.20 --> 1570.42]  But when I come back,
[1571.06 --> 1572.98]  it will be made well.
[1572.98 --> 1575.38]  And to those of us this morning
[1575.38 --> 1576.86]  who are limping along
[1576.86 --> 1577.88]  in the pain,
[1578.50 --> 1579.40]  who are frustrated
[1579.40 --> 1580.48]  with what feels like
[1580.48 --> 1581.90]  endless unanswered prayer,
[1582.46 --> 1583.78]  God says to all of us
[1583.78 --> 1584.80]  through the empty grave,
[1585.42 --> 1587.08]  your day is coming.
[1587.82 --> 1589.72]  The resurrection seals the future.
[1590.42 --> 1591.74]  And although the pain is here,
[1591.78 --> 1592.70]  and you'll be formed by it.
[1592.70 --> 1593.50]  I could preach a whole sermon
[1593.50 --> 1594.06]  just on that.
[1594.12 --> 1595.12]  You'll be formed and fashioned
[1595.12 --> 1595.96]  and deepened by it.
[1596.18 --> 1597.16]  Your day will come
[1597.16 --> 1599.40]  where mind, body, soul,
[1599.60 --> 1600.98]  relationship, and creation
[1600.98 --> 1603.28]  will be healed by Jesus Christ
[1603.28 --> 1604.18]  and we will live
[1604.18 --> 1605.60]  in resurrected healed bodies
[1605.60 --> 1606.14]  with Him
[1606.14 --> 1608.28]  in this good world forever.
[1610.38 --> 1611.64]  And until that day,
[1611.76 --> 1612.34]  we wait,
[1613.42 --> 1614.58]  we live in hope,
[1615.20 --> 1616.34]  and we pray.
[1617.16 --> 1618.94]  Because there are many prayers
[1618.94 --> 1620.38]  that we will experience
[1620.38 --> 1621.54]  answered between now
[1621.54 --> 1622.08]  and the grave,
[1622.20 --> 1623.74]  between now and Christ's return.
[1624.16 --> 1625.62]  And the invitation is to knock,
[1626.42 --> 1627.14]  to ask,
[1627.56 --> 1628.22]  and to seek.
[1629.08 --> 1629.94]  And don't be surprised
[1629.94 --> 1631.30]  when God, our generous Father,
[1631.42 --> 1632.16]  opens the door
[1632.16 --> 1634.00]  and reveals His goodness,
[1634.62 --> 1635.26]  His grace,
[1635.60 --> 1636.28]  and His provision.
[1638.80 --> 1639.82]  I'm going to lead us now
[1639.82 --> 1640.20]  in a prayer.
[1640.30 --> 1641.08]  I'm actually going to pray
[1641.08 --> 1642.30]  slowly the Lord's Prayer.
[1643.38 --> 1644.12]  And I'm just going to leave
[1644.12 --> 1646.20]  time of silence after that.
[1647.24 --> 1648.40]  And I want to invite you,
[1648.68 --> 1649.38]  wherever you are
[1649.38 --> 1650.56]  in your story of faith,
[1650.68 --> 1651.24]  wherever you are
[1651.24 --> 1652.36]  in your relationship with God,
[1652.56 --> 1654.30]  I want you to bring
[1654.30 --> 1655.44]  to your Heavenly Father
[1655.44 --> 1656.24]  whatever it is
[1656.24 --> 1656.94]  that's on your heart
[1656.94 --> 1657.52]  and your mind.
[1657.52 --> 1658.18]  You pray,
[1658.30 --> 1658.80]  and after that,
[1659.16 --> 1660.54]  I will finish our prayer
[1660.54 --> 1661.42]  and we'll worship together.
[1661.72 --> 1662.82]  So let me lead us in prayer.
[1670.10 --> 1671.34]  Our Father
[1671.34 --> 1673.00]  in heaven,
[1674.28 --> 1675.18]  hallowed be
[1675.18 --> 1676.56]  your name.
[1677.94 --> 1679.32]  Your kingdom come,
[1680.68 --> 1681.94]  your will be done,
[1681.94 --> 1683.64]  on earth
[1683.64 --> 1685.00]  as it is in heaven.
[1686.46 --> 1687.74]  Give us today
[1687.74 --> 1689.00]  our daily bread.
[1690.78 --> 1691.58]  Forgive us
[1691.58 --> 1692.68]  our sins,
[1693.22 --> 1694.92]  for we also forgive
[1694.92 --> 1696.02]  everyone who sins
[1696.02 --> 1696.88]  against us.
[1698.22 --> 1699.22]  Lead us not
[1699.22 --> 1700.14]  into temptation.
[1702.06 --> 1703.02]  Deliver us
[1703.02 --> 1704.18]  from the evil one,
[1705.00 --> 1706.00]  for yours is
[1706.00 --> 1706.48]  the kingdom
[1706.48 --> 1708.18]  and the power
[1708.18 --> 1709.52]  and the glory.
[1709.52 --> 1711.42]  And Father,
[1711.52 --> 1712.14]  we now ask
[1712.14 --> 1712.84]  that you hear
[1712.84 --> 1713.66]  and respond
[1713.66 --> 1714.74]  to our prayers.
[1714.74 --> 1714.80]  Thank you.
[1714.80 --> 1714.86]  Thank you.
[1714.86 --> 1714.88]  Thank you.
[1714.88 --> 1714.92]  Thank you.
[1739.52 --> 1740.52]  Thank you.
[1769.52 --> 1782.76]  Father,
[1782.82 --> 1783.28]  we thank you
[1783.28 --> 1784.08]  for the empty tomb.
[1785.76 --> 1786.44]  We thank you
[1786.44 --> 1787.50]  that you're near to us
[1787.50 --> 1788.22]  by your spirit
[1788.22 --> 1789.68]  and we thank you
[1789.68 --> 1791.06]  that you answer prayer.
[1791.30 --> 1792.40]  To you be all the glory
[1792.40 --> 1793.02]  and honor.
[1793.72 --> 1793.96]  Amen.
[1793.96 --> 1794.12]  Amen.
