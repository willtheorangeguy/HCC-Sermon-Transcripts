[0.00 → 5.40] One thing that we forgot to mention earlier is that this is also launch Sunday.
[5.60 → 9.34] That means that if you have a youth who's aged, or sorry, grades 4 to 7,
[9.50 → 11.72] they meet upstairs in the youth room,
[11.84 → 13.96] and they're going to go through the same passage as we are,
[14.08 → 15.48] together interactively and creatively.
[15.62 → 18.48] So if you have any youth, grades 4 to 7, I think a lot of them already left,
[18.56 → 20.40] but they still can leave, you know?
[20.50 → 22.06] There's still a chance to escape this sermon.
[25.94 → 28.38] We are going to continue our series on the book of Jonah.
[28.38 → 31.08] If you were here last week, you'll know that we overviewed the whole book,
[31.34 → 34.04] and we started with this conviction, I want to repeat it,
[34.08 → 36.38] that the book of Jonah is not about...
[36.38 → 37.88] Yeah, you're in there.
[38.56 → 41.54] And it is rather about God's love for a wicked city,
[42.08 → 43.90] or as the Bible Project summarizes it,
[43.94 → 49.22] is the story of a rebellious prophet who's angry at God for loving his enemies.
[49.92 → 52.62] And we're going to look at this morning how it's not only just about
[52.62 → 54.64] the way that God deals with Nineveh,
[54.78 → 57.00] but we're going to see this morning how God pursues Jonah.
[57.00 → 59.70] And for that, I'm going to read the whole first chapter of Jonah.
[59.80 → 61.60] So if you have your Bible, turn with me to the book of Jonah.
[62.20 → 66.00] And we're going to read what I think is just a masterfully crafted story
[66.70 → 70.30] of how Jonah finds himself in a whale, or a great fish, rather.
[70.40 → 70.98] It doesn't say whale.
[72.62 → 73.44] This is Jonah 1.
[73.44 → 77.20] The word of the Lord came to Jonah, son of Amit tai.
[77.84 → 80.60] Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it,
[80.80 → 82.96] because its wickedness has come up before me.
[84.04 → 86.98] But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish.
[87.38 → 90.40] He went down to Joppa, where he found a ship bound for that port.
[91.04 → 94.74] After paying the fare, he went aboard and sailed for Tarshish to flee from the Lord.
[95.62 → 97.74] Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea,
[97.74 → 101.16] and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up.
[101.86 → 105.24] All the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own God,
[105.72 → 108.14] and they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship.
[108.96 → 113.56] But Jonah had gone below deck, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.
[114.36 → 115.82] The captain went to him and said,
[115.90 → 116.82] How can you sleep?
[117.12 → 118.66] Get up and call on your God.
[119.00 → 121.78] Maybe he will take note of us so that we will not perish.
[121.78 → 124.06] Then the sailors said to each other,
[124.22 → 128.00] Come, let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity.
[128.86 → 129.88] So they asked him,
[129.88 → 132.32] They cast lots and the lot fell on Jonah.
[132.94 → 133.74] So they asked him,
[133.84 → 136.98] Tell us, who is responsible for making this trouble for us?
[137.26 → 138.58] What kind of work do you do?
[138.78 → 139.76] Where do you come from?
[139.98 → 140.84] What is your country?
[141.20 → 142.54] From what people are you?
[143.62 → 144.44] He answered,
[144.56 → 147.00] I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord,
[147.14 → 150.06] the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.
[150.06 → 153.44] This terrified them, and they asked,
[153.62 → 154.42] What have you done?
[155.14 → 156.98] They knew he was running away from the Lord,
[157.06 → 158.58] because he had already told them so.
[159.42 → 161.20] The sea was getting rougher and rougher,
[161.32 → 161.98] so they asked him,
[162.06 → 164.96] What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?
[165.94 → 168.56] Pick me up and throw me into the sea, he replied,
[168.88 → 170.28] and it will become calm.
[171.10 → 174.18] I know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you.
[175.28 → 177.50] Instead, the men did their best to row back to land,
[177.50 → 180.22] but they could not, for the sea grew even wilder than before.
[181.04 → 182.28] Then they cried out to the Lord,
[182.60 → 185.62] Please, Lord, do not let us die for taking this man's life.
[186.00 → 188.78] Do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man,
[188.86 → 191.30] for you, Lord, have done as you pleased.
[192.04 → 194.38] Then they took Jonah, and they threw him overboard,
[194.88 → 196.54] and the raging sea grew calm.
[197.84 → 200.58] At this, the men greatly feared the Lord,
[201.04 → 203.40] and they offered him sacrifices to the Lord,
[203.60 → 204.84] and made vows to him.
[204.84 → 208.98] Now, the Lord provided a huge fish to swallow Jonah,
[209.48 → 212.32] and Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days,
[212.62 → 213.94] and for three nights.
[218.66 → 220.90] Every Wednesday, in our fireside room,
[221.48 → 223.24] there is a group that meets.
[223.44 → 224.34] It's an AA group.
[225.50 → 227.40] And you probably, if you're part of the Pickleball Club,
[227.46 → 228.62] which is a pretty good number of us,
[228.66 → 230.78] you've seen that group meet every week after week.
[230.78 → 234.56] It's a place where people come to talk openly about their struggles
[234.56 → 236.00] in a safe environment with addiction.
[236.76 → 239.48] It's a place where they invite people to hold them accountable
[239.48 → 241.34] to the struggle they're going through.
[241.42 → 247.04] And it's also a place where incredible milestones of sobriety are celebrated.
[247.42 → 248.44] It's a remarkable group.
[249.60 → 251.24] If you're familiar with the AA world,
[251.30 → 253.56] you'll also know that they have this thing called interventions.
[254.50 → 257.50] And interventions are where family members and close friends
[257.50 → 259.90] of someone struggling deeply with alcohol addiction
[259.90 → 262.76] is where they lovingly confront them
[262.76 → 266.12] so that these people have a chance to see what's going on.
[266.56 → 268.42] They're caught in this web of addiction.
[268.64 → 269.74] They're destroying lives,
[269.76 → 271.32] and there's this whole wake of pain around them,
[271.34 → 272.48] and the family now wants to say,
[272.84 → 273.88] this is reality.
[274.54 → 275.98] We want to speak truth and love.
[276.04 → 276.90] We want to set boundaries
[276.90 → 280.42] so you have a chance to get the support you need
[280.42 → 282.10] and get your life back.
[283.64 → 286.94] I think Jonah 1 is a story of intervention.
[287.94 → 290.32] It's a story of God seeing Jonah go down this path
[290.32 → 291.62] that is not going well for him,
[291.66 → 296.10] and God reaches in and very severely intervenes
[296.10 → 299.22] such that Jonah has a chance to get his life back.
[299.90 → 304.38] He has a chance to get back in on what God's plan for his life is.
[304.86 → 306.10] This is an intervention.
[306.10 → 309.96] And I hope you can see the very masterful way
[309.96 → 311.18] this story is woven together.
[311.32 → 313.56] It's not just about God intervening with Jonah,
[313.64 → 316.24] but it's about God showing up to these sailors
[316.24 → 318.30] who at the beginning of the story
[318.30 → 320.30] are praying to their own gods
[320.30 → 322.60] and at the end of the story are making commitments to him.
[323.22 → 326.26] And it's also a story about God providing for Jonah.
[326.98 → 328.20] Under normal circumstances,
[328.36 → 329.88] the throwing overboard would lead to his death,
[329.96 → 330.78] but not in this story.
[330.84 → 333.68] In this story, God shows up powerfully, surprisingly,
[333.68 → 335.96] to give Jonah a second chance
[335.96 → 337.62] through the belly of the great fish.
[339.50 → 342.00] The intervention shows up in verse 4.
[342.94 → 343.70] Up until this point,
[343.78 → 346.58] Jonah probably thinks his plan is coming together quite well.
[346.66 → 347.66] He's heard the Lord speak.
[347.86 → 348.92] He dodged the call.
[349.02 → 351.38] He got on the boat to go as far as he could go.
[351.70 → 353.56] And then comes the storm.
[354.34 → 355.84] And verse 4 doesn't say it's just a storm.
[355.96 → 358.10] It says the Lord sent the storm.
[358.50 → 361.24] A storm so violent that it threatened to destroy the ship.
[361.24 → 363.10] A storm so violent that the people,
[363.26 → 364.46] these competent sailors,
[365.06 → 366.42] looked at what was in front of them
[366.42 → 368.72] and they started crying out to their gods.
[369.44 → 370.40] And that's a serious storm.
[370.50 → 372.76] If you've got sailors crying out to their gods,
[372.90 → 373.90] competent trained men,
[374.00 → 375.88] who are asking for divine intervention,
[375.98 → 376.84] this is a real storm.
[377.78 → 379.00] It's a moment of chaos
[379.00 → 380.46] where they're throwing stuff in the water
[380.46 → 381.76] just to stay alive.
[382.20 → 384.34] And then the story zooms in on Jonah.
[385.82 → 387.20] And what's Jonah doing?
[388.72 → 389.56] He's asleep.
[389.56 → 391.28] What an interesting juxtaposition.
[391.42 → 393.32] You've got this crazy, chaotic storm
[393.32 → 396.30] and you've got this man at the bottom of the boat sleeping.
[397.22 → 398.50] And I want to highlight something
[398.50 → 400.62] that the Hebrew points out in this story
[400.62 → 402.78] that we're not getting in our English translations very well.
[402.86 → 406.22] And that is from the moment Jonah said no to God's call,
[406.80 → 409.02] it's been telling a story of him going down.
[409.46 → 411.44] It starts with him going down to Joppa,
[411.80 → 412.78] down to the ship,
[412.94 → 414.26] down to the bottom of the ship.
[414.30 → 416.48] And then the Hebrew says down into a great sleep.
[416.56 → 418.50] It's just this slide downwards.
[418.50 → 421.76] One writer says it's the slippery slope of sin.
[422.56 → 425.30] And here's now Jonah completely unaware,
[425.64 → 428.52] completely asleep to all the chaos
[428.52 → 429.52] that's going on around him.
[429.62 → 432.06] Chaos that is his fault.
[432.86 → 434.12] It's a fascinating story.
[434.84 → 437.08] And God decides to use the captain of the ship
[437.08 → 438.58] who worships some other God
[438.58 → 440.80] to sort of shake Jonah awake
[440.80 → 442.70] and say, hey, you're a prophet.
[443.00 → 445.08] Maybe you can pray to your God
[445.08 → 446.50] so that he might deliver us.
[447.00 → 448.50] It's not the best day for a prophet
[448.50 → 449.92] when it's some other guy
[449.92 → 450.90] worshipping some other God
[450.90 → 452.36] who said, can you please pray for us?
[452.50 → 453.98] We need your God's help too.
[454.72 → 456.34] And this is Jonah's state of affairs
[456.34 → 457.46] in our story.
[457.46 → 461.54] So then the sailors cast lots.
[462.08 → 463.30] They want to know who's responsible.
[463.40 → 465.74] They have some sense that this is a divine event
[465.74 → 466.72] and they cast lots,
[466.82 → 468.62] probably dice that surface in a certain way.
[468.96 → 469.48] And through that,
[469.54 → 471.22] they find out that the fault lies with Jonah.
[471.48 → 474.20] And then comes this like rapid fire interrogation.
[474.50 → 475.24] Like, who are you?
[475.30 → 475.88] Where are you from?
[475.92 → 476.60] What do you do for work?
[476.64 → 477.28] Who are your people?
[477.66 → 478.14] Tell us.
[478.28 → 480.20] What is the cause of this problem?
[480.94 → 482.04] And then in verse 9,
[482.88 → 485.66] we get the first words from Jonah.
[485.74 → 487.14] He hasn't spoken yet in this story.
[487.20 → 487.92] It's just about him.
[487.96 → 488.68] And now in verse 9,
[488.78 → 489.66] Jonah opens his mouth.
[489.96 → 492.02] And I think these might be my favourite words
[492.02 → 492.86] in the passage,
[492.96 → 493.84] and I'll say why in a minute.
[494.18 → 495.50] This is what Jonah says to them.
[495.62 → 496.18] His defence.
[497.18 → 498.82] I am a Hebrew,
[499.76 → 501.50] and I worship the Lord,
[502.20 → 503.44] the God of heaven,
[504.14 → 506.86] who made the sea and the dry land.
[506.86 → 509.56] Now, I want to pause and ask you,
[509.64 → 510.74] what's going through your minds
[510.74 → 513.46] as you think of Jonah's sort of introduction of himself
[513.46 → 515.36] and who he is and who he worships?
[517.14 → 519.84] I think if we were the original readers of this passage,
[520.44 → 521.38] we might think to ourselves,
[521.74 → 523.26] get serious here, Jonah.
[524.62 → 526.30] You're saying that you worship the Lord?
[526.66 → 528.32] You're running away from him
[528.32 → 529.92] as far as you can go.
[530.16 → 531.70] You're saying that the Lord you worship
[531.70 → 533.02] is the God of heaven and earth
[533.02 → 534.42] who makes the sea and the dry land,
[534.50 → 536.26] and yet you're trying to escape from him
[536.26 → 537.50] on a boat.
[538.32 → 539.36] Like, that's good, Jonah.
[539.82 → 540.60] Very clever.
[541.26 → 543.12] And I think the original heroism,
[543.24 → 544.34] maybe we today feel,
[544.42 → 546.30] this incredible tension, right?
[546.68 → 548.52] Jonah's saying this about what he believes,
[548.58 → 550.32] and he's doing this.
[550.66 → 552.10] There's an incredible contradiction.
[552.28 → 553.96] Like, the irony is just too rich
[553.96 → 554.94] for us not to say, like,
[554.98 → 556.46] what, does this guy actually believe what he's saying?
[556.54 → 558.40] Is he just completely unaware of who he is
[558.40 → 559.02] and what he's doing?
[559.26 → 560.72] There's a massive gap.
[562.02 → 563.62] And this is also where I think
[563.62 → 565.86] we hit one of those mirror moments, okay?
[566.26 → 568.06] Remember last week when I shared the illustration
[568.06 → 570.30] of how Jonah functions a bit like a perfect joke
[570.30 → 572.08] where you're tracking with all the details,
[572.20 → 573.12] and then comes the punchline.
[573.22 → 574.36] Everyone's laughing, and you're laughing.
[574.50 → 576.46] Like, oh, that story's about me.
[577.26 → 579.56] I think Jonah is a mirror for Israel here.
[580.28 → 582.82] Israel, the original hearers and readers of this story,
[583.14 → 584.04] would have been reading this and saying,
[584.10 → 585.34] oh, man, what is this guy?
[585.40 → 586.44] He's saying he worships the Lord,
[586.52 → 587.24] and he's running away.
[587.72 → 588.64] And then they're like, oh, wait.
[589.30 → 590.54] Isn't Israel the community
[590.54 → 593.20] that's constantly running from the Lord?
[593.86 → 596.70] Aren't they the ones who have neglected their calling
[596.70 → 597.58] to love their neighbours
[597.58 → 600.64] and instead started adopting all the idols of their neighbours
[600.64 → 602.56] and followed the practices of their neighbours?
[603.10 → 604.38] Aren't the Israelites the one
[604.38 → 605.54] who now hate their enemies?
[606.28 → 607.00] This is a mirror.
[608.18 → 609.26] And let me ask you a question.
[609.98 → 612.38] Is it not also a mirror for the church today?
[613.38 → 615.46] Isn't Jonah sort of mirroring back to us
[615.46 → 617.66] one of the most common criticisms of the church?
[618.06 → 618.80] You know what that is?
[620.38 → 620.74] Hypocrites.
[621.66 → 623.68] Jonah's saying this, and he's doing this.
[623.74 → 624.94] He's saying he worshipped the Lord,
[625.02 → 626.20] but running from that Lord.
[626.54 → 628.44] Isn't that true of believers all the time?
[629.48 → 630.72] I mean, don't you have those moments
[630.72 → 632.26] where you're wrestling with your own life,
[632.64 → 633.92] your own patterns, your own habits,
[633.96 → 634.64] and you think to yourself,
[634.94 → 638.80] why do I do this when this is what I say I believe?
[639.70 → 641.56] Do you not have those moments in the middle of the night
[641.56 → 643.68] where you're like, what is with this habit in my life
[643.68 → 646.28] that is so grossly out of sync
[646.28 → 648.20] with what I'm telling people
[648.20 → 649.50] is true of who I am in Jesus?
[651.04 → 651.84] Jonah's the mirror.
[652.28 → 652.88] Do you see this?
[653.62 → 655.30] This is a very powerful moment here.
[656.76 → 659.46] Now, I think from verse 10 on, in my opinion,
[659.56 → 661.56] the story gets more fascinating
[661.56 → 664.06] and, I think, very challenging.
[664.20 → 665.88] So let me just walk us through verse 10.
[665.96 → 667.52] Verse 10, in my opinion, is confusing
[667.52 → 669.70] because Jonah reveals to these people
[669.70 → 671.38] who he is and who he worships,
[671.38 → 672.44] and what's their response?
[673.60 → 674.54] They're terrified.
[675.14 → 677.58] And then they ask him, what have you done?
[678.18 → 680.26] And then we read this parenthetical comment
[680.26 → 681.60] which is so intriguingly placed.
[681.92 → 684.62] It says, they knew he was running away from the Lord
[684.62 → 686.18] because he had already told them so.
[687.14 → 688.56] And so now I have to ask the question.
[688.66 → 689.74] Maybe this isn't confusing to you
[689.74 → 690.78] the way it was for me this week,
[690.78 → 693.78] but what is it about what Jonah said there
[693.78 → 696.26] that changed their take, right?
[696.32 → 698.10] They already knew Jonah was running from the Lord.
[698.32 → 699.56] They had a sense of acknowledgement,
[699.56 → 700.88] like, hey, they have their gods.
[701.00 → 701.82] Jonah has his God.
[702.14 → 703.42] Jonah's running away from his God.
[703.48 → 703.98] That's okay.
[704.12 → 705.70] But then Jonah speaks up
[705.70 → 707.06] and now they're terrified.
[708.08 → 709.38] So let's go back to what he says.
[709.50 → 711.26] Jonah says, I am a Hebrew.
[711.96 → 713.70] I worship the Lord, the God of heaven,
[714.18 → 716.24] the maker of the seas and the dry land.
[716.96 → 717.92] That's it right there.
[719.00 → 720.50] You see, perhaps up until this point,
[720.84 → 723.20] these men worship, they had a polytheism, right?
[723.24 → 724.08] There are lots of gods.
[724.16 → 725.04] They all do their own things.
[725.16 → 727.08] They have their intriguing elements and whatnot.
[727.08 → 729.96] But Jonah says this to them about his God
[729.96 → 731.02] and all of a sudden they're like,
[732.10 → 735.96] oh, the God you worship is the creator God.
[736.30 → 738.76] The God you worship is the creator of the sea
[738.76 → 740.14] and the land.
[740.24 → 741.36] And here we are in a storm
[741.36 → 744.58] and it looks like your God has the power to do that.
[745.26 → 746.36] And now we're afraid.
[747.64 → 748.92] They have a new encounter
[748.92 → 751.60] with the kind of power of Jonah's God.
[751.84 → 753.04] That's what's happening in verse 10.
[753.04 → 756.94] And so now we get to what happens next.
[757.10 → 758.82] And they say to Jonah, the storm's getting worse.
[759.32 → 760.48] They're getting more worried.
[760.58 → 762.32] And they say, what is it that we should do?
[762.44 → 764.70] And Jonah's response, most intriguing line ever.
[764.82 → 767.06] He's just like, throw me overboard.
[768.56 → 769.34] I don't know about you,
[769.38 → 770.62] but I think that's a really strange thing to say.
[770.68 → 771.22] It's like, you know what?
[771.70 → 773.18] I think you should throw me overboard.
[774.14 → 775.66] Pastor Sid and I were talking this week
[775.66 → 776.72] about how strange this is
[776.72 → 778.54] because like, well, why didn't you just jump overboard?
[779.04 → 780.76] But no, he had to be thrown overboard.
[780.76 → 783.98] And you should know that this is a very debated verse.
[784.12 → 785.24] Verse 12 is a debated verse
[785.24 → 787.56] because it's hard to know Jonah's motive.
[788.38 → 790.82] A very charitable reading of Jonah would say,
[790.96 → 793.28] man, this guy is overwhelmed with guilt, right?
[793.32 → 794.56] He knows the storm's his fault.
[794.90 → 796.74] He knows God has caught up with him in the storm.
[796.96 → 797.94] And he's feeling terribly
[797.94 → 800.66] that these sailors could die with him
[800.66 → 802.02] as a result of his sin.
[802.62 → 803.78] And so he's like, throw me overboard.
[803.88 → 804.82] We'll mitigate the damage.
[804.94 → 805.36] I'll die.
[805.46 → 805.88] You'll live.
[805.94 → 806.72] The storm will be okay.
[807.90 → 809.10] Another take altogether,
[809.10 → 811.68] and I'm a little more leaning towards this, I think,
[812.28 → 815.00] is where Jonah is basically saying in his heart,
[815.90 → 816.96] I would rather die,
[817.58 → 819.48] and it'll also mitigate the consequences.
[819.70 → 821.72] I'd rather die than have to go to Nineveh
[821.72 → 823.22] and preach to that city.
[823.80 → 825.64] This solidifies that I will not have to do
[825.64 → 826.68] what God wants me to do.
[827.36 → 829.12] And the reason I think that's a compelling argument
[829.12 → 831.08] in part is because this is not the first time
[831.08 → 832.14] Jonah asked to die.
[832.82 → 833.98] He does this twice in our story.
[834.08 → 836.40] Last week we talked about how in chapter four, verse two,
[836.40 → 839.00] after God shows compassion to Nineveh,
[839.38 → 840.66] Jonah takes God to task,
[840.70 → 841.44] and he says, you know what?
[842.22 → 843.28] I want you to let me die.
[844.46 → 845.64] And so there's a complexity here.
[845.80 → 848.86] And Pastor Sid is nicer to Jonah than I am.
[849.20 → 851.24] I'll let you just rest with the complexity of his motives.
[851.80 → 853.78] Nevertheless, however you interpret Jonah
[853.78 → 855.26] asking to be thrown into the water,
[855.68 → 858.34] a number of very surprising things happen, okay?
[859.30 → 860.36] First thing that happens
[860.36 → 862.72] is a prayer meeting breaks out on the boat.
[862.72 → 865.04] And now it's a bunch of sailors
[865.04 → 867.32] who are not praying to their own gods,
[867.48 → 868.68] but they're praying to God,
[869.26 → 871.18] the maker of the sea and the dry land.
[871.28 → 872.38] They're crying out to him saying,
[872.52 → 874.38] God, do not hold us accountable
[874.38 → 875.70] for throwing this man overboard.
[876.16 → 878.66] Show us mercy for taking this man's life.
[878.80 → 880.96] Do not make us punished for this.
[881.70 → 882.72] And they throw Jonah overboard.
[882.92 → 885.02] The water is calmed in the same way Jonah said it would be.
[885.32 → 888.20] And then they start worshipping God.
[888.58 → 889.90] They start making vows to him.
[889.90 → 891.84] And they start praising him, right?
[891.92 → 893.34] And this is another one of those moments
[893.34 → 895.28] where there's the big surprises of the story.
[895.38 → 897.92] You've got the prophet who's sinking down in the water
[897.92 → 900.76] and these pagan polytheistic sailors
[900.76 → 903.94] who are raising their arms and hearts to the Lord
[903.94 → 906.04] in worship and in commitment.
[906.60 → 907.48] They fear the Lord.
[909.24 → 910.84] That, I think, is foreshadowing,
[910.94 → 912.28] not just of Nineveh, right?
[912.36 → 914.12] These sailors represent what's going to happen in Nineveh.
[914.18 → 916.50] The whole city's going to come to fearing the Lord.
[916.50 → 918.52] But Nineveh itself is then a foreshadowing
[918.52 → 920.54] of what Jesus is going to do in his ministry.
[921.20 → 922.86] He's going to go to the outside places
[922.86 → 924.66] and invite those people to faith,
[925.08 → 926.66] repentance, and commitment to the Lord.
[927.26 → 928.46] And it's going to be the Sumerians
[928.46 → 929.98] and it's going to be the British Columbians
[929.98 → 932.74] who, by the grace of God, take hold of Christ
[932.74 → 934.60] and are grafted into the family.
[935.40 → 937.20] In Jonah, the outsiders come in
[937.20 → 939.06] and the insiders have to wrestle with
[939.06 → 940.52] a God who loves the outsiders.
[940.70 → 941.68] And that's happening right here.
[942.40 → 943.42] So that's the first surprise.
[943.54 → 945.14] The sailors are coming to faith.
[945.14 → 946.00] They're praying to the Lord.
[946.10 → 947.04] They're fearing him.
[947.56 → 948.72] The second surprise is,
[949.42 → 950.66] Jonah doesn't die.
[951.92 → 953.50] Under ordinary circumstances,
[953.92 → 955.58] this is game over for Jonah, right?
[955.64 → 956.80] You're getting thrown into a sea.
[957.16 → 957.66] This is it.
[957.98 → 961.24] But no, the Lord provides a great fish.
[961.32 → 962.72] And this, if you have a children's Bible story,
[962.82 → 964.04] this is the centre of it all.
[964.48 → 965.30] It's not actually the centre,
[965.38 → 966.04] but it's a part of it.
[966.58 → 968.48] The great fish swallows Jonah
[968.48 → 970.64] and we're told that Jonah was in the belly
[970.64 → 971.86] of that fish for three days
[971.86 → 972.82] and for three nights.
[972.82 → 975.54] And we have to remember,
[975.86 → 977.00] the reason that happens
[977.00 → 978.58] is because God,
[978.70 → 979.96] by his gracious intervention,
[980.08 → 981.54] is reaching into Jonah's life,
[981.66 → 982.44] into his rebellion,
[983.14 → 985.36] pulling him back into his mission
[985.36 → 986.64] so that through Jonah,
[987.16 → 988.54] the mercy of the living God
[988.54 → 989.64] can be made known to Jinnah.
[990.92 → 991.82] That's Jonah 1.
[993.02 → 994.60] And I want to take just a few minutes now
[994.60 → 995.98] to open up some powerful ways
[995.98 → 998.18] I think Jonah 1 speaks to us,
[998.28 → 1000.36] the way it mirrors back to us in our day.
[1000.36 → 1001.44] Number one,
[1002.44 → 1003.74] I think we just need to step back
[1003.74 → 1006.72] and marvel at the sovereign power of God.
[1007.22 → 1007.36] Okay?
[1007.88 → 1009.34] This story is all about
[1009.34 → 1011.76] a man who's trying to dodge God's call
[1011.76 → 1013.28] and get away from God
[1013.28 → 1015.96] and there's no way that this limits God.
[1016.60 → 1017.50] It's not like Jonah's saying,
[1017.62 → 1018.10] I'm out of here.
[1018.20 → 1019.54] It's not like God then starts panicking
[1019.54 → 1019.90] and be like,
[1019.96 → 1021.74] well, I guess that's it for Nineveh.
[1022.30 → 1023.76] I guess Jonah's a lost cause.
[1023.84 → 1024.56] I guess I've got to start
[1024.56 → 1025.56] in some other way entirely.
[1025.70 → 1026.90] That's not how the story goes.
[1026.90 → 1029.88] God orchestrates all these events
[1029.88 → 1032.72] to accomplish exactly what he wants to accomplish,
[1033.08 → 1034.52] much to Jonah's surprise
[1034.52 → 1036.60] and much to the sailor's surprise.
[1037.10 → 1037.26] Right?
[1037.66 → 1038.72] He brings the storm.
[1039.00 → 1040.02] He gets Jonah's attention.
[1040.14 → 1041.74] He wakes him up from his slumber.
[1041.98 → 1043.12] And in the midst of it all,
[1043.24 → 1044.32] God uses Jonah,
[1044.62 → 1045.32] think about this,
[1045.86 → 1046.84] to bring these sailors
[1046.84 → 1048.76] to know his name,
[1049.40 → 1050.32] to fear him.
[1050.96 → 1053.16] God is just amazingly orchestrating
[1053.16 → 1054.72] these events for his purposes.
[1054.72 → 1056.10] And let me emphasize this,
[1056.58 → 1057.84] God has not changed.
[1058.76 → 1060.70] The same God who's working in that story
[1060.70 → 1062.84] and all out the biblical story
[1062.84 → 1066.14] is still orchestrating his purposes today.
[1067.08 → 1068.42] He's still working on his purposes
[1068.42 → 1069.28] in your life,
[1069.62 → 1070.30] in my life,
[1070.40 → 1071.18] in our church,
[1071.48 → 1071.98] in our city,
[1072.00 → 1074.56] and he is not out of control.
[1075.78 → 1078.52] He is working his good and pleasing purposes
[1078.52 → 1079.76] as he sees fits
[1079.76 → 1082.12] and using very rebellious,
[1082.64 → 1084.36] broken, angry people
[1084.36 → 1085.56] to accomplish them.
[1086.66 → 1087.60] And that brings me
[1087.60 → 1088.52] to the second point
[1088.52 → 1090.20] of this passage for us.
[1091.00 → 1091.82] Last week we looked
[1091.82 → 1093.70] at God's gracious pursuit of Nineveh.
[1093.90 → 1094.42] And this morning
[1094.42 → 1095.34] we just have to pause
[1095.34 → 1096.00] and celebrate
[1096.00 → 1097.44] and be in wonder
[1097.44 → 1099.04] at God's gracious pursuit
[1099.04 → 1100.10] of Jonah.
[1101.82 → 1103.20] He does a lot
[1103.20 → 1104.74] to chase after
[1104.74 → 1106.12] a rebellious prophet.
[1106.70 → 1107.56] He doesn't have to do this.
[1107.88 → 1108.90] He could let Jonah run
[1108.90 → 1109.56] and ruin his life,
[1109.62 → 1110.22] but there's God
[1110.22 → 1111.32] showing up in the storm,
[1111.66 → 1113.04] bringing a severe grace,
[1113.04 → 1114.40] intervening because
[1114.40 → 1115.18] he wants Jonah
[1115.18 → 1116.32] in the game.
[1116.68 → 1117.22] He wants Jonah
[1117.22 → 1117.92] to know him
[1117.92 → 1118.84] and he wants the people
[1118.84 → 1119.18] of Nineveh
[1119.18 → 1119.88] through Jonah
[1119.88 → 1120.88] to know his love.
[1121.68 → 1122.88] That's an amazing thing
[1122.88 → 1124.18] that God says,
[1124.30 → 1124.36] no,
[1124.42 → 1124.96] I'm not just going to
[1124.96 → 1125.82] let this guy run away.
[1126.08 → 1127.18] I will pursue him
[1127.18 → 1128.84] and he will know
[1128.84 → 1129.56] my grace.
[1129.82 → 1130.88] He will know my mercy.
[1130.96 → 1131.92] He will know my provision
[1131.92 → 1132.92] and I'm going to use him
[1132.92 → 1134.38] in all of his brokenness.
[1135.24 → 1136.30] That shows so much
[1136.30 → 1137.12] about the heart of God.
[1138.74 → 1139.80] And I have a hunch,
[1139.80 → 1141.06] I mean you can confirm this
[1141.06 → 1142.04] in your own time,
[1142.10 → 1142.60] but I have a hunch
[1142.60 → 1143.84] that there's a number of us
[1143.84 → 1145.60] who when we read Jonah 1
[1145.60 → 1147.10] and the story of his running,
[1147.58 → 1148.90] the story of God showing up
[1148.90 → 1149.72] in a severe grace
[1149.72 → 1150.28] of intervention,
[1150.76 → 1151.46] I have a feeling
[1151.46 → 1152.86] you can read your own life
[1152.86 → 1153.74] through that lens.
[1155.24 → 1155.92] Is this resonating
[1155.92 → 1156.64] with some of us?
[1157.40 → 1158.64] The sense of perhaps
[1158.64 → 1159.76] knowing something about God,
[1159.84 → 1160.98] having a sense of his invitation
[1160.98 → 1161.76] into his life
[1161.76 → 1162.16] and you say,
[1162.26 → 1163.38] absolutely not.
[1163.80 → 1164.84] And you run from him,
[1164.90 → 1165.48] you avoid him,
[1165.56 → 1166.92] you totally reject
[1166.92 → 1167.52] whatever it is
[1167.52 → 1168.50] he might have for your life.
[1168.50 → 1170.90] And then comes the storm.
[1172.64 → 1174.44] Then comes the intervention.
[1175.24 → 1176.66] Then comes his disruption.
[1178.00 → 1178.12] You know,
[1178.16 → 1179.22] I remember sitting in a class
[1179.22 → 1180.12] at Regent College
[1180.12 → 1180.82] and Daryl Johnson,
[1180.92 → 1181.74] our prop at the time,
[1182.08 → 1182.90] he started the class
[1182.90 → 1183.44] by saying,
[1183.84 → 1184.88] welcome to this class.
[1185.28 → 1186.46] What is it that you were doing
[1186.46 → 1186.94] in your life
[1186.94 → 1188.58] before God totally disrupted it
[1188.58 → 1189.72] and brought you into a seminary
[1189.72 → 1190.66] so that you could be a pastor?
[1191.14 → 1192.06] And then people started
[1192.06 → 1192.82] sharing the stories.
[1192.86 → 1193.04] I'm like,
[1193.08 → 1193.90] I didn't want to do this.
[1193.96 → 1194.84] I had no interest in this.
[1194.88 → 1195.52] This is not what I had
[1195.52 → 1195.92] for my life.
[1195.92 → 1197.92] But God intervened.
[1198.90 → 1200.42] And we have our stories
[1200.42 → 1201.04] of intervention.
[1202.16 → 1203.08] It's probably not being
[1203.08 → 1204.08] on a boat in the storm.
[1204.44 → 1205.52] But perhaps for you,
[1205.60 → 1206.78] it's a serious car accident
[1206.78 → 1209.04] or a motorcycle accident
[1209.04 → 1210.06] where God took hold of you
[1210.06 → 1211.44] and he woke you up.
[1212.52 → 1213.90] Perhaps it's the sheet of paper
[1213.90 → 1214.34] you got,
[1214.42 → 1215.28] the doctor's results
[1215.28 → 1216.06] from your MRI.
[1216.92 → 1217.86] And there you sat
[1217.86 → 1219.08] looking at numbers
[1219.08 → 1219.96] you don't want to see.
[1220.42 → 1222.10] And God woke you up.
[1223.16 → 1224.62] Perhaps it's a family crisis
[1224.62 → 1226.04] where you could no longer run.
[1226.04 → 1226.94] You were stuck
[1226.94 → 1228.86] and God had your attention.
[1230.56 → 1232.00] Perhaps it's losing a job
[1232.00 → 1233.28] that you really loved
[1233.28 → 1235.36] and you had to re-evaluate
[1235.36 → 1236.14] your identity.
[1236.94 → 1237.52] Perhaps it's getting
[1237.52 → 1238.06] out of university
[1238.06 → 1239.50] and never getting that job
[1239.50 → 1240.48] and having to make sense
[1240.48 → 1241.52] of the purpose of your life.
[1241.78 → 1242.74] And God shows up,
[1243.14 → 1244.00] shakes you awake
[1244.00 → 1244.40] and says,
[1244.54 → 1245.76] this is my plan for you.
[1246.52 → 1247.00] Follow me.
[1247.90 → 1248.66] I think there are
[1248.66 → 1249.66] so many testimonies,
[1249.76 → 1250.94] even in our church,
[1251.48 → 1252.54] of God showing up
[1252.54 → 1253.26] in an intervention.
[1253.26 → 1254.46] It's a severe grace
[1254.46 → 1255.50] that we would never want
[1255.50 → 1256.12] for ourselves.
[1256.86 → 1257.84] And often at the moment,
[1258.12 → 1259.48] you are really resenting
[1259.48 → 1259.82] the Lord
[1259.82 → 1261.88] and often 10, 15, 20 years later
[1261.88 → 1262.48] where you look back
[1262.48 → 1262.92] and you say,
[1263.80 → 1266.14] ah, that's what he was doing.
[1266.66 → 1267.84] That was my intervention.
[1268.12 → 1268.76] Praise the Lord.
[1269.54 → 1270.78] Who knows where I would have gone
[1270.78 → 1272.22] if I got to stay in control
[1272.22 → 1272.96] and keep running.
[1273.14 → 1274.60] Who knows what kind of destruction
[1274.60 → 1275.34] I'd bring to myself
[1275.34 → 1275.72] and others
[1275.72 → 1277.90] if God didn't in a severe mercy
[1277.90 → 1278.94] show up,
[1279.40 → 1280.08] wake me up
[1280.08 → 1281.44] and bring me back to himself.
[1281.44 → 1283.72] Praise the Lord
[1283.72 → 1284.82] for the way he has intervened
[1284.82 → 1286.70] in your and in my life,
[1287.08 → 1288.24] such as us being here
[1288.24 → 1288.86] as a testimony
[1288.86 → 1290.24] to his intervention.
[1294.06 → 1295.10] Thirdly and finally,
[1295.60 → 1297.02] I think Jonah 1 tells us
[1297.02 → 1298.08] something very simple
[1298.08 → 1299.34] that I don't want us to forget,
[1300.20 → 1301.70] that God can do a lot
[1301.70 → 1302.90] with a little.
[1303.90 → 1305.46] God can do a lot
[1305.46 → 1306.40] with a little.
[1307.00 → 1307.96] Here's what I mean by that.
[1308.00 → 1308.68] This week I was reading
[1308.68 → 1309.28] this long,
[1309.98 → 1311.36] actually quite boring commentary,
[1311.44 → 1312.66] on this passage.
[1312.76 → 1313.28] At the end,
[1313.70 → 1314.82] the writer of the commentary
[1314.82 → 1315.22] just said,
[1315.30 → 1315.52] you know,
[1315.72 → 1316.44] what's remarkable
[1316.44 → 1317.40] about this story
[1317.40 → 1318.44] is the fact that
[1318.44 → 1319.82] in spite of Jonah,
[1320.66 → 1321.70] God used Jonah
[1321.70 → 1322.68] to make himself known.
[1323.54 → 1325.50] In spite of Jonah's failure,
[1325.70 → 1326.26] his running,
[1326.42 → 1327.36] all the weirdness,
[1327.44 → 1327.94] the contradiction
[1327.94 → 1328.66] between what he says
[1328.66 → 1329.18] and what he does,
[1329.54 → 1331.00] God uses that little statement
[1331.00 → 1331.64] from Jonah
[1331.64 → 1332.66] to open the eyes
[1332.66 → 1333.34] up to these sailors
[1333.34 → 1334.50] such that they start
[1334.50 → 1335.66] crying out to God
[1335.66 → 1336.44] and then committing
[1336.44 → 1337.32] their lives to him.
[1338.40 → 1340.34] God uses a rebellious prophet
[1340.34 → 1341.40] who's running from him
[1341.40 → 1342.66] to bring others to faith.
[1343.44 → 1344.70] He can do a lot
[1344.70 → 1345.90] with a little.
[1347.24 → 1347.98] Now let me say,
[1348.40 → 1349.22] I happen to believe
[1349.22 → 1350.42] that in many churches,
[1350.56 → 1351.62] and ours is no exception,
[1352.40 → 1354.26] I think there's a deep-seated lie.
[1354.36 → 1354.96] You ready for it?
[1355.22 → 1356.06] I almost want to call this
[1356.06 → 1356.94] a demonic lie.
[1357.18 → 1357.92] And the lie is this.
[1358.28 → 1360.24] The lie is that God can't use you
[1360.24 → 1361.94] because you're a bit
[1361.94 → 1362.78] too complicated.
[1363.72 → 1364.70] He can't use your life
[1364.70 → 1365.22] because it's just
[1365.22 → 1366.94] a little too messed up.
[1366.94 → 1368.52] You're a little too broken.
[1368.72 → 1369.28] Your relationship's
[1369.28 → 1370.12] a little too fractured.
[1370.22 → 1371.06] You're not as close
[1371.06 → 1372.02] to his heart as you want,
[1372.08 → 1372.80] and therefore you feel like,
[1372.84 → 1373.18] you know what?
[1373.36 → 1373.98] I'm going to sit
[1373.98 → 1375.08] on the sidelines
[1375.08 → 1375.84] of his plan.
[1376.36 → 1376.88] I'm going to sit
[1376.88 → 1377.64] on the sidelines
[1377.64 → 1378.44] of whatever his purposes
[1378.44 → 1379.08] are in the world
[1379.08 → 1380.12] and just trust that
[1380.12 → 1380.74] he's going to find
[1380.74 → 1381.74] some ultra-Christians
[1381.74 → 1382.28] somewhere else
[1382.28 → 1382.82] in this church,
[1383.10 → 1383.96] somewhere else in this city,
[1384.06 → 1384.68] and he's going to use
[1384.68 → 1386.02] those people over there.
[1386.84 → 1387.74] And I think Jonah says,
[1387.88 → 1388.38] watch out.
[1389.38 → 1390.56] He can do a lot
[1390.56 → 1391.40] with a little.
[1392.12 → 1394.00] He can use rebellious prophets
[1394.00 → 1394.54] who are running
[1394.54 → 1395.18] from the Lord
[1395.18 → 1396.56] to bring sailors to faith
[1396.56 → 1397.48] on a ship
[1397.48 → 1398.30] where the storm
[1398.30 → 1399.14] is his fault.
[1399.64 → 1400.70] Surely he can use you
[1400.70 → 1402.14] in your neighbourhood,
[1402.28 → 1402.80] in your workplace,
[1402.92 → 1403.42] in your family,
[1403.48 → 1404.30] with your friends.
[1405.14 → 1406.04] God can do a lot
[1406.04 → 1406.48] with a little.
[1407.46 → 1408.04] And if you were here
[1408.04 → 1408.64] last year
[1408.64 → 1409.14] when we were going
[1409.14 → 1410.16] through the Gospel of John,
[1410.40 → 1411.00] I did a number
[1411.00 → 1411.94] of interviews with people
[1411.94 → 1412.76] about their story
[1412.76 → 1413.54] of becoming Christians.
[1413.74 → 1414.64] And one of the things
[1414.64 → 1416.00] that really stuck out to me
[1416.00 → 1417.64] among all the testimonies
[1417.64 → 1418.10] that were shared
[1418.10 → 1420.90] is the very ordinary things
[1420.90 → 1422.28] that were part of the story
[1422.28 → 1423.10] of becoming Christians.
[1423.76 → 1424.42] It's a roommate
[1424.42 → 1425.10] who gives someone
[1425.10 → 1426.08] a ride to school
[1426.08 → 1426.92] or it's a family
[1426.92 → 1428.08] that invites a student
[1428.08 → 1428.90] over for a meal.
[1429.00 → 1429.40] It's a teacher
[1429.40 → 1430.94] who shows just a morsel
[1430.94 → 1432.02] of concern for this kid
[1432.02 → 1432.90] who's new to the class,
[1433.22 → 1433.92] et cetera, et cetera.
[1433.98 → 1434.84] And God uses all these
[1434.84 → 1436.54] incredibly ordinary things,
[1437.34 → 1438.04] ordinary acts,
[1438.18 → 1438.76] ordinary meals,
[1438.84 → 1439.66] and uses those
[1439.66 → 1441.54] to bring people along
[1441.54 → 1443.68] to become people
[1443.68 → 1444.02] who say,
[1444.18 → 1444.90] I want to know Jesus.
[1445.30 → 1446.48] I want to make vows to him.
[1446.72 → 1447.50] I want to follow him
[1447.50 → 1448.30] for the rest of my life.
[1449.68 → 1452.00] That's how powerful God is.
[1452.68 → 1453.78] He can use broken,
[1454.04 → 1454.88] rebellious prophets.
[1455.02 → 1456.26] He can use ordinary believers
[1456.26 → 1457.46] who don't always have
[1457.46 → 1458.68] the most consistent lives
[1458.68 → 1459.04] in Christ,
[1459.14 → 1460.02] and yet by his grace
[1460.02 → 1460.52] and mercy
[1460.52 → 1461.30] and his sovereign care,
[1461.54 → 1462.90] he weaves that together
[1462.90 → 1464.10] to bring your neighbour,
[1464.24 → 1464.74] your friend,
[1465.40 → 1465.96] your daughter,
[1466.16 → 1466.58] your mother,
[1466.72 → 1467.24] your dad,
[1467.30 → 1468.40] your son to faith.
[1469.62 → 1470.46] Can we just praise
[1470.46 → 1471.24] the Lord for that?
[1472.26 → 1473.40] And our stories, again,
[1473.60 → 1474.74] give testimony to that.
[1474.80 → 1475.54] I know a number of us
[1475.54 → 1475.94] who were here
[1475.94 → 1477.18] because our siblings
[1477.18 → 1478.48] shared the gospel with us.
[1478.88 → 1479.18] A number of us
[1479.18 → 1479.50] who were here
[1479.50 → 1480.18] because we saw
[1480.18 → 1480.76] the consistency
[1480.76 → 1481.86] of someone's life in Christ
[1481.86 → 1482.88] and they cared for us
[1482.88 → 1483.94] and God used that
[1483.94 → 1484.86] to bring us
[1484.86 → 1485.58] to a place of faith.
[1485.72 → 1486.50] Praise the Lord
[1486.50 → 1487.92] for his sovereign grace
[1487.92 → 1489.88] that broke into our lives.
[1495.90 → 1497.12] I think it's worth noting,
[1497.22 → 1498.20] and maybe this is one of the points
[1498.20 → 1498.72] not to forget
[1498.72 → 1499.34] from this sermon,
[1499.78 → 1501.42] that what we believe
[1501.42 → 1502.64] is not just information
[1502.64 → 1504.40] about God.
[1505.26 → 1506.14] What we believe
[1506.14 → 1506.76] is truly
[1506.76 → 1509.04] a transformative power
[1509.04 → 1511.04] that when God acts,
[1511.20 → 1512.52] he acts in power.
[1513.48 → 1514.26] Let me say a little bit
[1514.26 → 1514.82] more about that.
[1514.96 → 1516.30] When God sees our world
[1516.30 → 1517.24] living in rebellion,
[1517.52 → 1518.04] and Jonah, again,
[1518.12 → 1519.16] he mirrors Israel,
[1519.26 → 1519.90] he mirrors the world
[1519.90 → 1520.80] that runs from him.
[1521.10 → 1521.84] When he sees the world
[1521.84 → 1523.14] that chooses to plunge
[1523.14 → 1523.70] more deeply
[1523.70 → 1524.98] into sin and rebellion,
[1525.10 → 1525.88] what he does is
[1525.88 → 1528.18] act in power.
[1529.00 → 1530.06] And the cross of Jesus
[1530.06 → 1531.92] is God's great intervention
[1531.92 → 1532.56] in a world
[1532.56 → 1533.38] that is not set
[1533.38 → 1534.10] on following him.
[1534.34 → 1534.92] And it's God saying,
[1535.12 → 1535.92] in spite of you,
[1536.38 → 1537.38] I will bring rescue
[1537.38 → 1537.88] and redemption.
[1537.88 → 1539.08] In spite of you,
[1539.22 → 1540.62] I will defeat the power
[1540.62 → 1541.70] that's gripped your hearts,
[1541.82 → 1543.00] that causes you to run,
[1543.18 → 1543.98] and I'm going to release
[1543.98 → 1545.02] a greater power
[1545.02 → 1546.38] that will transform
[1546.38 → 1546.98] the world,
[1547.02 → 1547.60] and that power
[1547.60 → 1548.62] is the very life
[1548.62 → 1549.40] of the resurrection
[1549.40 → 1550.80] of Jesus Christ.
[1551.48 → 1552.38] The resurrection
[1552.38 → 1553.54] that he gives to us
[1553.54 → 1554.50] before his ascension.
[1555.26 → 1556.26] Ephesians 1 says,
[1556.40 → 1557.36] the very same power
[1557.36 → 1558.18] that rose Jesus
[1558.18 → 1558.76] from the dead
[1558.76 → 1560.62] is alive
[1560.62 → 1561.74] in you
[1561.74 → 1562.74] also.
[1564.16 → 1565.14] The gospel
[1565.14 → 1566.62] is a transforming
[1566.62 → 1567.66] power.
[1567.88 → 1568.98] And it should never
[1568.98 → 1569.60] surprise you
[1569.60 → 1570.52] that your weak words,
[1570.66 → 1571.32] your weak actions,
[1571.62 → 1572.56] your bumbling life
[1572.56 → 1573.78] of seeking to follow Jesus
[1573.78 → 1574.76] is taken up
[1574.76 → 1576.14] by a very powerful God
[1576.14 → 1577.04] who by the work
[1577.04 → 1577.58] of the Spirit
[1577.58 → 1578.30] brings people
[1578.30 → 1579.00] to know Jesus
[1579.00 → 1580.58] because the gospel
[1580.58 → 1582.56] is a transforming power.
[1583.82 → 1584.24] And again,
[1584.72 → 1586.52] our lives bear witness
[1586.52 → 1587.08] to that.
[1587.56 → 1588.60] Our worship this morning
[1588.60 → 1589.64] reflects that somehow
[1589.64 → 1591.56] God in his amazing grace
[1591.56 → 1592.54] has brought you
[1592.54 → 1593.34] and your family,
[1593.54 → 1594.32] you and your friend,
[1594.40 → 1594.84] your couple,
[1594.84 → 1596.74] to bring to a place
[1596.74 → 1597.80] of worship.
[1600.22 → 1601.20] That's the God
[1601.20 → 1602.46] of Jonah 1
[1602.46 → 1604.24] who is sovereignly
[1604.24 → 1605.20] working out his plan
[1605.20 → 1607.12] in spite of rebellion,
[1607.26 → 1608.46] using a broken person
[1608.46 → 1609.22] to bring sailors
[1609.22 → 1609.78] to faith
[1609.78 → 1611.08] and in the grace
[1611.08 → 1611.76] that he has
[1611.76 → 1613.52] opens up a fish's mouth
[1613.52 → 1614.60] to rescue Jonah
[1614.60 → 1616.08] so he gets to be sent
[1616.08 → 1617.00] into the city
[1617.00 → 1617.50] of Nineveh.
[1618.74 → 1619.20] And perhaps
[1619.20 → 1620.28] that's where I'll finish.
[1620.72 → 1621.42] God has broken
[1621.42 → 1622.40] into our lives.
[1622.40 → 1623.40] He has intervened
[1623.40 → 1624.28] in your life
[1624.28 → 1625.16] so that we get
[1625.16 → 1625.86] to participate
[1625.86 → 1627.80] in bearing witness
[1627.80 → 1628.28] to the love
[1628.28 → 1629.12] of Jesus Christ
[1629.12 → 1630.52] and his power
[1630.52 → 1631.18] to the world.
[1632.22 → 1632.92] Let's pray.
[1640.62 → 1641.08] Father,
[1641.14 → 1641.58] we thank you
[1641.58 → 1641.90] for the way
[1641.90 → 1642.88] you pursue us.
[1644.78 → 1645.58] We thank you
[1645.58 → 1646.80] that you are in control.
[1648.42 → 1649.50] And we thank you
[1649.50 → 1651.68] even for the severe grace
[1651.68 → 1652.64] that we have experienced
[1652.64 → 1653.28] in the storms
[1653.28 → 1654.08] of our life
[1654.08 → 1656.10] that have woken us up.
[1657.40 → 1658.40] And we pray, Lord,
[1658.50 → 1659.50] for those in our lives,
[1659.58 → 1660.38] perhaps it's even us
[1660.38 → 1660.90] this morning,
[1661.34 → 1662.54] who are in that storm,
[1663.42 → 1664.52] who are experiencing
[1664.52 → 1665.34] the frustration,
[1665.52 → 1666.38] and I pray that you would
[1666.38 → 1667.80] use the difficulty
[1667.80 → 1668.70] of our lives
[1668.70 → 1670.30] to wake us up
[1670.30 → 1670.96] to your grace,
[1671.32 → 1672.74] to bring us back
[1672.74 → 1673.50] into your presence
[1673.50 → 1675.48] so that we can be used
[1675.48 → 1676.64] in this world
[1676.64 → 1677.82] to make Jesus known.
[1677.82 → 1680.08] we thank you
[1680.08 → 1680.82] that you hold
[1680.82 → 1682.00] this world in your hands
[1682.00 → 1683.62] and you have redeemed it
[1683.62 → 1684.56] by Jesus Christ.
[1685.84 → 1686.50] May he receive
[1686.50 → 1687.16] all the glory
[1687.16 → 1688.00] and the praise
[1688.00 → 1688.68] from us.
[1689.10 → 1689.34] Amen.
[1691.56 → 1692.82] I invite you to stand
[1692.82 → 1693.36] and sing
[1693.36 → 1694.34] a song of response
[1694.34 → 1695.02] that celebrates
[1695.02 → 1696.32] the grace of Jesus Christ.
[1696.32 → 1710.46] and then sing
[1710.66 → 1711.20] We thank you
[1711.20 → 1712.50] to our music
[1712.50 → 1713.20] that Christmas
[1713.20 → 1713.22] will be
[1713.22 → 1713.64] our guest
[1714.02 → 1714.60] so feel
[1714.60 → 1715.54] to speak
[1715.60 → 1715.80] as cool as
[1716.02 → 1716.10] together.
[1716.26 → 1716.88] Thank you
[1716.88 → 1717.14] for watching
[1717.14 → 1718.10] oh yes
[1718.10 → 1718.60] and you
[1718.60 → 1719.18] today
[1719.18 → 1719.34] you
[1719.64 → 1721.64] you
[1721.64 → 1722.08] have
[1722.08 → 1722.56] all the
[1722.56 → 1723.06] lawsuits
[1723.06 → 1723.58] that
[1723.58 → 1723.62] it
[1723.62 → 1724.16] will
[1724.16 → 1725.14] be
