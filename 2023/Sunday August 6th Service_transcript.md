[0.00 --> 4.44]  Good morning.
[7.28 --> 14.30]  It's so good to be with you all and spend some time together in God's Word.
[14.54 --> 15.72]  What a blessing that is.
[17.78 --> 19.54]  Welcome back to the Grun family.
[19.74 --> 20.52]  That's wonderful.
[22.60 --> 27.86]  We're going to continue, as we have throughout the summer, in our series on the Beatitudes.
[27.86 --> 34.12]  So I'm just going to jump right in and read with you Matthew 5, the verses 1 through 12.
[34.70 --> 36.76]  And then we'll conclude it today.
[37.20 --> 38.20]  So look at it with me.
[39.90 --> 47.56]  Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
[47.84 --> 51.46]  And his disciples came to him, and he began to teach them.
[52.36 --> 52.94]  And he said,
[53.70 --> 56.80]  Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[57.86 --> 61.46]  Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[62.60 --> 65.08]  Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
[66.46 --> 70.12]  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
[71.56 --> 74.20]  Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
[75.78 --> 78.08]  Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
[79.32 --> 82.56]  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
[82.56 --> 84.62]  And then our passage today.
[85.66 --> 90.90]  Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[91.30 --> 97.56]  Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely see all kinds of evil against you because of me.
[98.84 --> 103.26]  Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven.
[103.26 --> 107.64]  For in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
[107.64 --> 110.98]  So here we are.
[111.14 --> 111.76]  Last one.
[112.00 --> 115.84]  Today we look at blessed are the persecuted, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[116.12 --> 118.08]  And you likely might be thinking, really?
[120.16 --> 120.58]  Really?
[120.78 --> 122.52]  Blessed are you when you're persecuted?
[122.92 --> 124.62]  Who wants that?
[126.10 --> 127.80]  Hungering and thirsting for a right living?
[127.98 --> 128.16]  Sure.
[128.54 --> 129.30]  A pure heart?
[129.46 --> 129.80]  Yes.
[130.60 --> 131.02]  Merciful?
[131.22 --> 131.42]  Sure.
[131.82 --> 132.26]  Peacemaking?
[132.36 --> 132.74]  Of course.
[132.74 --> 134.42]  Being persecuted?
[135.58 --> 139.70]  What a way to end the series and this beatitude.
[140.92 --> 142.54]  But boy, is that what you really want?
[143.66 --> 152.12]  Look at what this German theologian, I'm going to mess his name up, Helmut Thielicki, a German theologian, but he said this.
[152.82 --> 153.82]  And it should be up on your screen there.
[153.82 --> 155.96]  What a ghastly prospect.
[155.96 --> 163.60]  It makes one ask in all seriousness how Jesus could ever have gained disciples with an appeal like that.
[164.12 --> 173.00]  And then it does not sound like sheer mockery for him to go on and say in the face of the tortures of body and soul to which they were actually exposed, rejoice and be glad.
[173.46 --> 178.94]  If that's not mockery, and surely it can't be that, then it must be some great mystery here which we do not see.
[178.94 --> 183.04]  And maybe we'll scratch the surface of that mystery a little bit this morning.
[184.00 --> 186.10]  So yes, this is a tough one.
[187.00 --> 191.78]  Pastor Jonathan last week rightly commented, let Sid deal with that one.
[193.18 --> 194.76]  I really appreciate that, Jonathan.
[195.08 --> 195.64]  So anyways.
[197.54 --> 208.12]  It's interesting when you look at this that you notice that in verse 10 and 11, this is the first that the Beatitudes do this, is that Jesus repeats himself.
[208.12 --> 210.12]  He says the same thing twice.
[210.74 --> 213.86]  Maybe because he knows we won't believe we heard it right the first time.
[214.70 --> 219.60]  Or maybe because this one hits close to home for Jesus himself with his upcoming suffering.
[221.00 --> 222.58]  Also notice the pronoun change.
[222.88 --> 227.64]  He goes from blessed are they to blessed are you when you're persecuted.
[228.08 --> 233.28]  It's no longer this theoretical they, but a very personal you.
[233.70 --> 235.44]  You will be persecuted.
[235.44 --> 237.76]  And you, and you, and you, and you.
[238.12 --> 240.18]  He's bringing us into this.
[242.24 --> 246.18]  And then with the line, on account of me.
[247.24 --> 248.70]  On account of me.
[249.22 --> 253.48]  You'll find yourself in difficult places because of me.
[254.74 --> 257.24]  Timothy, 2 Timothy, we read this.
[257.24 --> 261.00]  In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life.
[261.64 --> 262.60]  You've got to see that.
[262.74 --> 266.76]  Who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
[267.26 --> 267.82]  Not maybe.
[268.24 --> 268.66]  Will be.
[269.26 --> 269.66]  All right.
[270.86 --> 271.96]  There's where we're at.
[272.14 --> 273.30]  We're at this place here.
[273.86 --> 275.50]  And it's because of Jesus' righteousness.
[275.92 --> 283.14]  Jesus is not blessing those who get persecuted for being obnoxious or arrogant or tactless or insensitive.
[283.14 --> 284.78]  That's not what's going on here.
[284.98 --> 287.06]  That is not on account of Jesus.
[287.36 --> 288.84]  That is on account of your ego.
[289.66 --> 290.60]  You own that one.
[291.24 --> 299.66]  Jesus is blessing those who experience opposition because their desire to see life work the way the creator intended it to.
[299.66 --> 306.76]  And these beatitude qualities, Jesus blesses, they're not natural to us.
[306.84 --> 308.84]  They're not natural human qualities.
[309.32 --> 311.10]  We don't produce them.
[312.32 --> 318.60]  It's only when Jesus and His gospel, His good news gets a hold of our lives and our thoughts and our mind.
[318.96 --> 322.30]  Then we will know our poverty of spirit.
[322.62 --> 326.94]  Then we will know what it is to mourn the brokenness of the world and ourselves.
[326.94 --> 331.30]  And we will become meeker and gentler and we'll hunger and thirst for more.
[331.60 --> 333.20]  And we'll seek purity of heart.
[333.52 --> 337.38]  And we'll make peace as much as we can.
[338.46 --> 341.26]  And we'll get persecuted because of it.
[343.62 --> 347.30]  Believers all over the world experience persecution.
[347.30 --> 357.90]  If we total up the number of Christian martyrs for their faith in the 20th century, it works out to an average of about 450,000 people a year.
[359.70 --> 363.18]  That's over 200 million people in that time.
[363.70 --> 368.70]  Christians in 60 countries today are denied basic human rights because of their faith in Jesus.
[368.70 --> 372.98]  It's why Jesus said in John 15, look at it with me.
[373.38 --> 375.96]  If the world hates you, keep in mind it hated me first.
[376.24 --> 380.38]  If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you.
[380.60 --> 383.18]  If they obeyed my teachings, they will obey yours also.
[383.26 --> 385.18]  And he's speaking there to the church in many ways.
[385.70 --> 392.86]  And for us who really don't fear persecution in that way, maybe it feels a little bit foreign.
[393.10 --> 394.24]  But many in the world do.
[394.24 --> 398.80]  For us, maybe it's more of a matter of not getting pulled into the world and its value system.
[399.92 --> 402.04]  So I thought, how can we approach this?
[402.12 --> 404.04]  And so I thought of a passage, and I'm going to read it.
[404.08 --> 406.60]  It's a little bit long, but out of 1 Peter 2.
[406.94 --> 410.24]  And I'm going to unpack that with you, and then we'll do some thinking.
[410.36 --> 412.58]  But what is the idea of persecution for us?
[412.94 --> 413.78]  So look at it with me.
[414.22 --> 415.02]  1 Peter 2.
[417.48 --> 418.18]  He writes,
[418.18 --> 437.42]  For in Scripture it says,
[437.42 --> 441.82]  See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen precious cornerstone.
[441.94 --> 442.58]  That's Jesus again.
[442.90 --> 445.68]  And the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.
[446.56 --> 451.34]  Now to you who believe this stone is precious, but to those who do not believe,
[451.66 --> 455.58]  the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
[456.26 --> 461.54]  And the stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.
[462.30 --> 465.86]  They stumble because they disobey the message, which is also what they were destined for.
[465.86 --> 471.14]  But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession,
[471.52 --> 476.44]  that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
[477.16 --> 479.24]  Once you were not a people, but now you are a people of God.
[479.30 --> 481.48]  Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[481.86 --> 488.86]  Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from sinful desires,
[489.38 --> 491.08]  which wage war against your soul.
[491.08 --> 495.90]  Live such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong,
[496.24 --> 499.40]  they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
[500.18 --> 503.86]  To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you,
[504.26 --> 506.90]  leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps.
[507.78 --> 510.12]  He committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth.
[510.38 --> 512.64]  When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate.
[512.88 --> 514.42]  When he suffered, he made no threats.
[514.76 --> 518.54]  Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
[518.54 --> 526.26]  He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness.
[527.06 --> 528.84]  By his wounds you have been healed.
[529.92 --> 532.68]  This is about his righteousness.
[534.06 --> 537.24]  This passage addresses the persecution for righteousness.
[537.68 --> 543.08]  It does so that we will then live our lives with a vision of righteousness.
[543.08 --> 547.82]  A vision that I want Hope Community Church to have.
[548.22 --> 552.90]  For us as a church, we are a chosen race, a holy people set apart,
[553.08 --> 556.26]  not to go hide, but to serve the world that God so loves.
[556.42 --> 558.58]  Not a bunch of losers who have been persecuted.
[558.92 --> 561.68]  Not an obnoxious group yelling at everyone.
[561.98 --> 568.02]  This passage talks about how the church lives within the tension of the world around us.
[568.02 --> 572.94]  A tension that we maintain.
[573.32 --> 575.98]  We're not trying to eliminate this tension necessarily.
[576.44 --> 580.54]  Living out the righteousness of Jesus, yet loving the world profoundly.
[581.66 --> 583.44]  We're trying to do all of that.
[585.10 --> 589.18]  That's why in verse 5, it talks about living stones built to be a light in the world,
[589.42 --> 590.68]  with Jesus as the cornerstone.
[590.96 --> 592.66]  Built together with Jesus as central.
[592.94 --> 594.30]  Sharing life together.
[594.30 --> 595.86]  Supporting each other.
[596.18 --> 597.94]  Working in the community around us.
[598.44 --> 600.50]  Built to be together.
[600.90 --> 601.52]  The body.
[601.68 --> 602.00]  Us.
[602.26 --> 604.66]  Not just a bunch of individuals with some faith.
[608.00 --> 611.50]  It takes a group to live out the righteousness of Christ.
[612.66 --> 614.20]  The good news that he came to bring.
[614.64 --> 617.72]  We live out the beatitudes in community.
[618.72 --> 622.08]  We experience the spirit's work together in us.
[622.08 --> 628.68]  And in this, Peter tells us there's a deep tension between this work and the world around us.
[628.72 --> 635.86]  And when we say world, we're saying the part that operates in opposition or neglect of God.
[637.34 --> 643.28]  Many Christians, by the way, deal with this tension in one of two ways that aren't particularly good.
[643.52 --> 646.56]  The first is, some separate from society.
[647.00 --> 648.78]  Society is them.
[648.78 --> 652.08]  And we're not them.
[652.26 --> 653.30]  We're exclusive.
[653.82 --> 654.88]  We have lots of rules.
[655.08 --> 658.08]  And we like to hide away and criticize the world around us.
[659.20 --> 662.38]  And the second way, society is us.
[662.96 --> 665.40]  And we almost have no rules and almost no doctrines.
[665.56 --> 666.96]  And we have total accommodation.
[667.28 --> 667.76]  Just come.
[668.00 --> 669.50]  You don't have to believe anything.
[669.88 --> 673.14]  We're completely inclusive and never critical in any way.
[673.14 --> 678.38]  And then instead of a slogan of belong, believe, become, we simply have a slogan that says belong.
[678.78 --> 679.40]  And we're done.
[679.56 --> 680.48]  We don't worry about beliefs.
[680.68 --> 681.56]  We don't worry about becoming.
[683.50 --> 684.82]  Those are the two extremes.
[687.82 --> 694.16]  And both, interestingly, these approaches are about, in a weird way, about power.
[695.24 --> 697.56]  You want to be accepted by the culture around you?
[697.76 --> 699.42]  Just adopt their values.
[700.72 --> 701.54]  Go for it.
[701.54 --> 705.28]  Then the church assimilates and everyone loves you and you gain power.
[707.06 --> 712.22]  And those who separate also want to gain power, but more by vilifying the world.
[713.66 --> 717.88]  Talk about how bad the world is and how we stand alone against that tide.
[718.32 --> 720.00]  And there's weird power in that too.
[720.00 --> 727.38]  Interestingly, those two extremes help avoid suffering.
[728.00 --> 730.36]  Because you either stay away from the world.
[730.96 --> 732.82]  You're just a weird group out there.
[733.46 --> 734.62]  And so you isolate.
[735.26 --> 738.92]  Or the accommodate all approach also avoids suffering because we fit in.
[739.12 --> 740.06]  We're just like everybody else.
[740.22 --> 741.38]  We haven't upset anybody.
[741.38 --> 748.94]  I'm going to read verse 11 and 12 of 1 Peter once more here.
[748.94 --> 755.08]  Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from sinful desires which war against your soul.
[755.36 --> 758.52]  Live such good lives among the pagans, those who don't know God,
[758.52 --> 764.18]  that though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits.
[765.54 --> 768.24]  What an amazing balance.
[770.72 --> 772.18]  What an amazing balance.
[773.22 --> 774.86]  We don't assimilate.
[776.02 --> 778.86]  We don't just absorb the values around us.
[778.86 --> 780.92]  We are aliens.
[782.16 --> 782.96]  Meaning foreigners.
[784.12 --> 786.56]  When you become a Christian, you become a foreigner.
[786.84 --> 789.70]  In a sense, the scripture says you're a peculiar people somehow.
[791.02 --> 795.20]  One Roman historian writer at that time said Christians were another genus.
[795.56 --> 796.76]  Another species.
[797.82 --> 798.74]  That's how he described it.
[799.06 --> 799.76]  Why do you say that?
[800.00 --> 806.56]  Because Christians were not just another religious group keeping their faith values private like everyone else.
[806.56 --> 810.64]  It rather shaped the way they lived in their culture.
[811.36 --> 812.56]  They were a chosen race.
[812.64 --> 813.36]  A holy people.
[813.64 --> 815.54]  Holy and set apart yet not separate.
[817.44 --> 819.58]  They became counter-cultural.
[820.50 --> 825.28]  They didn't go to the bloody gladiator events and so were considered anti-social.
[825.64 --> 829.08]  They didn't serve in the military supporting Caesar's wars of conflict.
[829.32 --> 831.62]  As Jonathan mentioned last week, the Pax Romano.
[831.68 --> 833.56]  They weren't part of that piece because they had a better piece.
[833.56 --> 837.98]  They were against abortion.
[838.18 --> 841.94]  They were against infanticide where you didn't want your baby.
[842.02 --> 843.34]  You left it to die on a hillside.
[844.04 --> 848.92]  They empowered women in positions of leadership contrary to the society around them.
[850.36 --> 854.30]  They were against sex outside of marriage or defining sex as you saw fit.
[854.30 --> 858.80]  They strongly supported the poor.
[859.76 --> 864.00]  In their gathering, races and class distinctions were disregarded and put aside.
[864.34 --> 866.96]  And only Christ was the way.
[868.22 --> 870.54]  Only Christ for salvation.
[871.56 --> 875.46]  This in a society where everyone had their own God or gods.
[875.46 --> 879.90]  And kind of like, well, you know, it doesn't matter.
[882.00 --> 884.48]  No one had ever seen a group like this.
[884.86 --> 885.68]  They're aliens.
[886.52 --> 887.62]  They're not like the Greeks.
[887.74 --> 888.46]  They're not like the Romans.
[888.58 --> 889.42]  They're not like the Jews.
[890.36 --> 891.88]  And guess who got persecuted?
[894.08 --> 895.04]  Guess who suffered?
[895.04 --> 897.12]  And we're still aliens.
[897.24 --> 897.88]  We're still foreigners.
[898.24 --> 906.22]  We don't fit into the Western individualistic, there we go, consumeristic, self-centered, self-absorbed society around us.
[906.34 --> 909.56]  We don't fit into conservatism or liberalism.
[912.56 --> 913.94]  We've always been aliens.
[915.58 --> 917.26]  We never really fit in.
[917.26 --> 922.40]  In the world, not of it.
[925.10 --> 928.48]  But we are residents aliens.
[929.78 --> 931.12]  We live here.
[931.42 --> 932.60]  We do life here.
[932.96 --> 939.62]  We have our PR cards, our permanent residence cards, where we live in this world and we're part of this world.
[939.84 --> 941.60]  We're in it, just not of it.
[941.60 --> 948.06]  And we are not called to assimilate and we are not called to attack.
[951.24 --> 956.60]  It says here, Paul says, or Peter says, live such good lives.
[958.14 --> 961.76]  Like Jesus is saying, let your light shine in the darkness.
[961.76 --> 969.66]  So people may see, although they may not like what you're trying to get them to see.
[971.60 --> 973.12]  And this is about serving.
[973.24 --> 975.28]  This isn't just about talking all the time.
[975.86 --> 977.18]  Sometimes I think there's too much talk.
[977.82 --> 979.96]  If you assimilate, you don't suffer.
[980.26 --> 982.22]  If you separate, you don't suffer.
[982.50 --> 989.40]  If you live with and serve and love and yet maintain biblical values and truth, the world will not like that all the time.
[989.70 --> 993.32]  And yet you will be respected for that in some weird way too.
[995.82 --> 997.22]  Which is what we're trying to do.
[997.22 --> 1001.66]  You will be misunderstood.
[1003.02 --> 1003.74]  That's okay.
[1006.18 --> 1008.36]  Because we look at the world differently.
[1009.40 --> 1011.42]  Yet they will see the good you do.
[1011.82 --> 1013.38]  And that can be compelling.
[1013.86 --> 1018.82]  Oh, you do the community food for the poor, really?
[1019.14 --> 1022.26]  Oh, you offer great programs for kids.
[1023.02 --> 1023.64]  Anybody's kids?
[1023.72 --> 1024.60]  Yeah, yeah, we do that too.
[1024.60 --> 1027.62]  Oh, you hang out with people that don't believe like you do?
[1027.82 --> 1028.78]  Yeah, yeah, we do.
[1028.86 --> 1029.96]  We want to be with you.
[1030.16 --> 1031.92]  We want you to see we love you.
[1032.52 --> 1034.54]  We're not here to throw stones.
[1036.90 --> 1039.22]  We're here to hold up the way of Jesus.
[1044.26 --> 1046.18]  And you're recognized for the good done.
[1046.18 --> 1053.00]  You know, most people love the forgiving and the accepting and the grace and all that's wonderful.
[1053.50 --> 1056.04]  But don't ask me to change my life.
[1056.34 --> 1057.50]  Don't criticize it.
[1057.82 --> 1058.78]  Then I'll turn on you.
[1062.24 --> 1064.28]  And yet that could be the most loving thing you could do.
[1064.28 --> 1075.54]  This is the life of the church that is in the world, but not of it.
[1077.16 --> 1081.50]  We love and serve, yet we don't condone or assimilate.
[1081.90 --> 1084.82]  We hold up life as God made it to be as an act of love.
[1085.08 --> 1087.70]  This is how we live and make a difference in the world.
[1087.70 --> 1091.84]  Yes, this will invite persecution or criticism, but that's okay.
[1092.64 --> 1094.22]  Jesus was light in darkness.
[1094.66 --> 1097.34]  His mere presence exposed attitudes and behaviors.
[1097.78 --> 1099.52]  And this wasn't always welcomed.
[1099.94 --> 1102.50]  And we know this for ourselves.
[1103.20 --> 1104.44]  That's why we stay humble.
[1104.88 --> 1108.18]  We know his light exposes our darkness.
[1111.24 --> 1113.16]  And we don't always like that either.
[1113.16 --> 1116.94]  Jesus, why do you have to shine a light in that corner?
[1117.00 --> 1118.76]  I had that pretty well hidden over here.
[1119.02 --> 1120.86]  Why are you shining a light here?
[1122.46 --> 1124.10]  Because I want you to be healed of that.
[1124.40 --> 1126.26]  I don't want to look at it.
[1128.36 --> 1129.38]  But you need to.
[1133.66 --> 1137.18]  And only then, only then will we see our poverty.
[1137.18 --> 1138.64]  That we're poor in spirit.
[1138.96 --> 1141.06]  And only then will we hunger and thirst for more.
[1141.06 --> 1144.24]  And only then will we seek his righteousness and his grace.
[1144.56 --> 1147.00]  And then this begins to change us through the spirit's power.
[1147.32 --> 1149.08]  And then we show mercy because we know mercy.
[1149.34 --> 1151.28]  And then we forgive because we know forgiveness.
[1151.66 --> 1154.76]  And we become peacemakers because we know Jesus' peace and shalom.
[1155.04 --> 1157.88]  And we become more and more like Jesus.
[1164.72 --> 1169.24]  When we say Jesus is Lord and only him, we're going to find criticism.
[1171.06 --> 1174.86]  And we'll be accused of being intolerant and judgmental.
[1176.64 --> 1181.94]  While trying to share Christ's righteousness and love and grace.
[1184.32 --> 1186.80]  I'm going to read a quote to you from Mortimer Arias.
[1186.96 --> 1188.78]  He's a Bolivian evangelist.
[1188.82 --> 1189.56]  And he says this.
[1189.56 --> 1194.04]  The arrival of the kingdom produces a crisis.
[1194.94 --> 1198.40]  It is like a sword that draws a dividing line.
[1198.76 --> 1202.88]  And cuts through the most intimate and sacred relationships and loyalties.
[1203.50 --> 1207.12]  And subordinates any former value or commitment.
[1207.98 --> 1209.28]  The kingdom is reversal.
[1209.48 --> 1212.46]  And as such, the permanent subverter of human orders.
[1212.98 --> 1215.94]  The proclaimer of this kingdom could not expect any other treatment.
[1215.94 --> 1219.56]  Than the one reserved for the subversives in human history.
[1222.04 --> 1225.60]  In the world, not of it.
[1226.56 --> 1227.62]  What a balance.
[1228.90 --> 1231.76]  And as a church, we strive to strike that balance.
[1231.90 --> 1234.62]  But I'm sure we failed many times to strike that balance.
[1234.92 --> 1237.14]  And so we keep coming to the cornerstone, to Jesus Christ.
[1237.32 --> 1239.98]  And we come and we admit that we tried other cornerstones.
[1240.14 --> 1242.02]  That didn't work particularly well.
[1242.02 --> 1244.68]  Because everyone builds on something.
[1245.08 --> 1247.46]  And sometimes we want these substitute cornerstones.
[1247.58 --> 1248.58]  Whatever they are for you.
[1248.84 --> 1252.36]  And I encourage you to look in your life where you have a false cornerstone.
[1252.62 --> 1254.70]  And say, I need to replace that with Jesus again.
[1257.64 --> 1258.60]  And then repent.
[1259.30 --> 1260.36]  And come again to Jesus.
[1260.48 --> 1262.46]  The one who is the way, the truth, and the life.
[1262.84 --> 1263.92]  Nothing else.
[1263.92 --> 1267.90]  And then realign your life to His.
[1269.40 --> 1270.52]  To His righteousness.
[1271.54 --> 1272.66]  The righteousness that you seek.
[1272.76 --> 1275.02]  His ways then become your ways.
[1275.68 --> 1277.34]  His truth, your truth.
[1278.74 --> 1282.98]  Jesus was rejected because you were precious to Him.
[1284.02 --> 1286.82]  So He willingly died to bring you wholeness in Him.
[1287.08 --> 1290.40]  And you then in turn bring that good news to the world around you.
[1290.64 --> 1293.20]  By His rejection, you are accepted by the Father.
[1293.20 --> 1296.54]  In turn, you bring good news to those who feel rejected.
[1297.02 --> 1299.04]  So they can find acceptance in Christ.
[1299.38 --> 1301.40]  Instead of a faulty cornerstone.
[1304.18 --> 1304.98]  So yes.
[1306.60 --> 1310.42]  Blessed are those who choose Christ's righteousness.
[1312.00 --> 1313.46]  Even if it means persecution.
[1316.18 --> 1317.00]  Let us pray.
[1317.00 --> 1317.04]  Let us pray.
[1317.04 --> 1324.90]  Father God, we thank you for coming to us.
[1325.96 --> 1328.18]  For allowing yourself to suffer.
[1329.74 --> 1333.86]  To suffer the persecution of injustice.
[1333.86 --> 1337.54]  At the hands of those who you came to save.
[1339.32 --> 1343.24]  Father, might we be a people who seek your righteousness.
[1343.46 --> 1346.28]  And if that results in opposition, criticism.
[1346.94 --> 1347.58]  So be it, Lord.
[1347.66 --> 1350.64]  But may we not be people who just want to shoot our mouths off.
[1350.74 --> 1351.56]  May that not be the case.
[1351.84 --> 1353.68]  It may be a people who want to share you.
[1353.86 --> 1355.80]  Not just in word, but in deeds.
[1355.80 --> 1358.64]  And may then the world around us see the good we do.
[1358.64 --> 1361.02]  And be drawn toward you.
[1362.28 --> 1364.04]  Lord, make us such a people.
[1365.34 --> 1366.54]  May you be our cornerstone.
[1366.86 --> 1367.52]  In Jesus' name.
[1367.86 --> 1368.08]  Amen.
[1371.20 --> 1374.04]  Today we share in communion.
[1376.98 --> 1379.60]  Where we remember again.
[1380.02 --> 1381.48]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[1381.48 --> 1383.10]  We remember again.
[1383.48 --> 1384.34]  Jesus' love.
[1384.86 --> 1385.40]  And grace.
[1385.94 --> 1386.88]  And ways of living.
[1389.20 --> 1392.14]  And him taking on all the brokenness of life.
[1392.50 --> 1395.42]  And turning it and renewing it into life.
[1396.36 --> 1398.56]  Shining light in dark places.
[1400.34 --> 1403.52]  Martin Luther is thinking about this whole thing of persecution and affliction.
[1403.86 --> 1404.78]  Martin Luther said,
[1405.08 --> 1406.92]  Affliction is the best book in my library.
[1409.32 --> 1410.48]  Do some thinking about that.
[1411.48 --> 1413.34]  But it's true, isn't it?
[1413.70 --> 1416.52]  Sometimes in the hard things, I've done more growing than anything else.
[1418.68 --> 1420.76]  In a way, that's following the ways of Jesus, right?
[1421.30 --> 1422.88]  Philip Yancey said this.
[1423.40 --> 1423.68]  He said,
[1424.10 --> 1427.94]  Pain redeemed impresses me more than pain removed.
[1429.80 --> 1430.90]  And then he went on.
[1431.42 --> 1434.80]  We're concerned with how things turn out.
[1435.18 --> 1437.78]  God seems more concerned with how we turn out.
[1437.78 --> 1442.40]  We're just trying to remove hard things.
[1443.48 --> 1446.10]  And Jesus is trying to take hard things and shape us into people.
[1446.82 --> 1449.24]  Who know what the Beatitudes and what Jesus is all about.
[1451.14 --> 1454.48]  Blessed are you when you live like Jesus.
[1455.00 --> 1457.02]  And you reflect him in your day-to-day living.
[1457.02 --> 1457.38]  Jesus.
[1457.38 --> 1457.44]  Jesus.
[1461.44 --> 1465.86]  The one who gave us his body.
[1467.40 --> 1470.26]  So that we could have life.
[1471.04 --> 1473.20]  The one who shed his blood.
[1475.48 --> 1477.36]  So that we could be cleansed.
[1477.36 --> 1482.36]  This is what we celebrate when we celebrate communion.
[1483.52 --> 1486.30]  I invite you to go to one of the tables.
[1486.82 --> 1488.86]  And receive Jesus.
[1489.86 --> 1490.72]  His body.
[1490.86 --> 1491.38]  His blood.
[1491.72 --> 1493.30]  So that you may be cleansed.
[1493.52 --> 1496.18]  So that you may be empowered to live like him.
[1496.72 --> 1499.40]  Blessed to be a blessing.
[1499.40 --> 1504.92]  I invite the elders and deacons to come to the tables.
[1505.70 --> 1507.92]  And once they're there, feel free to go to one of those tables.
[1507.92 --> 1507.98]  Thank you.
