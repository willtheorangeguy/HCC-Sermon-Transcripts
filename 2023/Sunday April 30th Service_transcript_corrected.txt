[1144.38 → 1146.48] of sinful men
[1146.48 → 1148.54] thy glory
[1148.54 → 1150.54] may not
[1150.54 → 1151.68] sing
[1151.68 → 1154.04] only
[1154.04 → 1156.02] thou art
[1156.02 → 1157.64] holy
[1157.64 → 1160.24] there is
[1160.24 → 1162.38] none beside
[1162.38 → 1163.88] thee
[1163.88 → 1165.92] perfect
[1165.92 → 1167.92] in power

[1170.72 → 1172.88] and purity

[1184.52 → 1186.52] lord
[1186.52 → 1188.52] almighty
[1188.52 → 1190.52] all
[1190.52 → 1192.10] thy works
[1192.10 → 1193.56] shall praise
[1193.56 → 1194.76] thy name
[1194.76 → 1197.72] in earth and sky

[1205.52 → 1206.52] holy
[1206.52 → 1207.52] merciful
[1207.52 → 1210.52] and mighty
[1211.52 → 1212.52] Lord
[1214.32 → 1215.52] in three
[1215.52 → 1216.52] persons
[1217.38 → 1218.52] blessed
[1219.20 → 1220.52] Trinity
[1220.52 → 1225.40] we serve
[1225.40 → 1225.76] a God
[1225.76 → 1226.48] who is holy
[1226.48 → 1227.18] and mighty
[1227.18 → 1229.44] and to be feared
[1229.44 → 1231.36] but he's also a God
[1231.36 → 1232.40] who has revealed himself
[1232.40 → 1233.22] as our father
[1233.22 → 1235.08] and called us friends
[1235.08 → 1236.54] so let's sing together
[1236.54 → 1237.16] of the goodness
[1237.16 → 1238.36] of this gracious God
[1238.36 → 1239.00] that we serve
[1239.00 → 1255.96] I love you Lord
[1255.96 → 1261.34] for your mercy never fails me
[1261.34 → 1263.34] all my days
[1263.34 → 1264.14] all my days
[1264.14 → 1265.64] I've been held
[1265.64 → 1267.34] in your hands
[1267.34 → 1271.46] from the moment that I wake up
[1271.46 → 1274.34] until I lay my head
[1274.34 → 1276.34] I will sing
[1276.34 → 1280.34] of the goodness of God
[1280.34 → 1282.34] of the goodness of God
[1282.34 → 1283.34] of the goodness of God
[1283.34 → 1284.34] of the goodness of God
[1284.34 → 1287.34] all my life you have been faithful
[1287.34 → 1288.34] all my life you have been faithful
[1288.34 → 1293.34] all my life you have been so, so God
[1293.34 → 1300.34] with every breath that I have made
[1300.34 → 1308.34] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1308.34 → 1311.34] I love your voice
[1311.34 → 1312.34] I love your voice
[1312.34 → 1316.34] you have led me through the fire
[1316.34 → 1319.34] and in the darkest night
[1319.34 → 1323.34] you are close like no other
[1323.34 → 1327.34] I've known you as a father
[1327.34 → 1331.34] I've known you as a friend
[1331.34 → 1337.34] and I have lived in the goodness of God
[1337.34 → 1344.34] all my life you have been faithful
[1344.34 → 1352.34] all my life you have been so, so God
[1352.34 → 1358.34] with every breath that I have made
[1358.34 → 1365.34] I will sing of the goodness of God
[1365.34 → 1370.34] your goodness is running after
[1370.34 → 1372.34] it's running after me
[1372.34 → 1377.34] your goodness is running after
[1377.34 → 1380.34] it's running after me
[1380.34 → 1382.34] with my life laid down
[1382.34 → 1384.34] I've surrendered now
[1384.34 → 1386.34] I give you everything
[1386.34 → 1389.34] your goodness is running out
[1389.34 → 1391.34] your goodness is running out
[1391.34 → 1395.34] it's running after me
[1395.34 → 1401.30] Your goodness is running out, it's running out to me.
[1402.30 → 1408.30] Your goodness is running out, it's running out to me.
[1408.30 → 1414.58] My life lay down, I've surrendered now, I gave you everything.
[1416.28 → 1422.30] Your goodness is running out, it's running out to me.
[1422.30 → 1427.36] All my life you have been paid.
[1429.94 → 1436.94] All my life you have been so, so good.
[1437.66 → 1448.30] Every breath that I have made, I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1448.30 → 1455.94] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1455.94 → 1462.52] You may be seated.
[1462.52 → 1472.70] Good morning, Hope.
[1473.70 → 1478.22] I see a number of faces I don't recognize, and I just want to say welcome to the family
[1478.22 → 1482.18] and the friends who've come here to witness and celebrate with their family and friends
[1482.18 → 1483.92] who are doing profession of faith and baptism.
[1484.82 → 1488.90] It's helpful to note that at Hope Community Church, we baptize babies, and when they are
[1488.90 → 1492.94] baptized as a baby, we invite them to do what's called a public profession of faith, where
[1492.94 → 1497.54] they say, hey, that which was spoken at my baptism is something that I take hold of in faith and
[1497.54 → 1498.36] want to share publicly.
[1499.12 → 1502.96] And this morning, we also have people who have not yet received baptism who will be baptized,
[1503.56 → 1506.82] and all six of the students who you'll hear from are going to be joining our church as
[1506.82 → 1511.26] members as the body of Christ with the gift they are to our city and to our community.
[1513.66 → 1516.62] There's a well-known phrase that maybe you have heard before.
[1516.76 → 1521.26] It says that Christianity is only one generation away from going extinct.
[1522.16 → 1525.16] One generation away from that being it.
[1526.10 → 1530.32] And what's behind that statement, of course, is that every new generation that comes up needs
[1530.32 → 1532.36] to hear the gospel and respond to the gospel.
[1532.36 → 1536.26] And not only do we have a responsibility to share the gospel with those who do not know
[1536.26 → 1539.38] it, but to impart that same good news of who Jesus is to our children.
[1540.40 → 1543.44] And this morning, we have the privilege of hearing some of those children who have grown
[1543.44 → 1546.66] up in our community, some who are new to our community, professing that they want to take
[1546.66 → 1550.08] hold of Christ by faith and follow him with the rest of their lives.
[1551.34 → 1555.96] The last time we had a profession of faith, just under a year ago, one of the people read
[1555.96 → 1558.06] this passage from Romans 10, verse 9.
[1559.30 → 1560.14] This is what we read.
[1560.14 → 1564.96] This is Paul saying, this is the message concerning the faith that we proclaim.
[1565.96 → 1571.72] If you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised
[1571.72 → 1575.44] him from the dead, you will be saved.
[1577.22 → 1579.38] Now, today is not a day that comes by accident.
[1580.72 → 1583.66] As you meet the students in just a minute as they come up here, you'll realize that they
[1583.66 → 1588.06] have testimonies of the grace of Christ, that he has shown up in their lives in a whole
[1588.06 → 1588.94] variety of ways.
[1589.64 → 1594.36] He's shown up to the teaching of parents, through prayers at night, scripture around
[1594.36 → 1597.26] the table, discipleship, ordinary discipleship in the home.
[1597.94 → 1601.46] They have been formed to understand the goodness of Christ as they have gone through their own
[1601.46 → 1606.00] adversity, their own challenges, as they face the reality of the pain and suffering in our
[1606.00 → 1606.32] world.
[1606.32 → 1610.84] They have learned through youth ministry and children's ministry who Jesus is and what
[1610.84 → 1613.52] it means to follow the story of the Bible.
[1614.22 → 1619.14] And their stories are stories that say the gospel of Jesus, which was true yesterday, is
[1619.14 → 1619.68] true today.
[1620.22 → 1624.60] The faithfulness of God, which is true for former generations, is true for our generation.
[1624.60 → 1629.52] And so at this point, I want to invite up onto the stage Alex and Timothy.
[1629.96 → 1630.62] Where are the rest?
[1631.30 → 1632.14] Way over there.
[1632.40 → 1633.94] Zoe and Kennedy and Raya.
[1634.78 → 1635.28] One more.
[1635.36 → 1635.88] I'm missing one.
[1636.18 → 1637.36] And May, who's right behind them.
[1637.40 → 1641.72] Come up on the stage here so you can all see those who are being baptized and professing
[1641.72 → 1642.14] their faith.
[1642.14 → 1642.26] Thank you.
[1654.60 → 1662.82] I just want to say to all six of you, it's been a privilege to get to know you over the
[1662.82 → 1663.54] last number of years.
[1663.64 → 1665.26] Some of you I've known for a number of years.
[1666.02 → 1670.00] May, I remember, interesting story about May is she just showed up out of nowhere at
[1670.00 → 1674.24] our church over COVID and says, I need to talk to a pastor about faith and life.
[1674.24 → 1676.64] And here she is sharing her story of faith.
[1676.72 → 1680.20] And we just praise the Lord for the different ways that you've come into our community, for
[1680.20 → 1682.16] the different ways that Christ has been at work in your life.
[1682.16 → 1686.64] I know I speak on behalf of Misha and Jonathan, wherever he is, as we've been preparing for
[1686.64 → 1690.32] this and doing some discipleship preparation on, you know, what is the story of the Bible?
[1691.18 → 1694.06] What does it mean to live faithfully as believers in Western society?
[1694.60 → 1697.22] What does it mean to be part of a church and serve with your gifts?
[1697.66 → 1700.98] And as we've gotten to know your stories and as you've gotten to learn, even in this
[1700.98 → 1706.20] process of being ready for this day, it's a gift to see that Jesus Christ is alive.
[1706.64 → 1707.74] His spirit is at work in you.
[1707.74 → 1711.98] And today is a day when we celebrate the gift of grace that has met you in your lives.
[1712.80 → 1713.90] Here's how we're going to do it today.
[1714.36 → 1718.18] I'm going to ask all six of you four questions of commitment.
[1719.50 → 1724.54] After that, I'm going to invite our church to make a commitment to journey with you in
[1724.54 → 1725.50] your discipleship journey.
[1726.08 → 1728.24] And then we're going to hear you give your testimonies.
[1728.62 → 1730.34] Then we'll do the professions of faith.
[1730.76 → 1732.12] Then we'll do the baptisms.
[1732.34 → 1735.06] Then I'm going to invite family members on the stage, and we're going to pray for you and
[1735.06 → 1736.50] celebrate the goodness of God.
[1736.56 → 1737.16] Does that sound good?
[1737.16 → 1740.76] And I'm just letting you know in advance, this will not be a short service.
[1741.40 → 1744.48] You know, we said two weeks ago that Western people are really anxious about time.
[1744.74 → 1746.80] Today's the day to put your watch away, put the phone away.
[1747.16 → 1749.56] We're just going to enjoy the time of being together.
[1750.48 → 1753.44] And so, first I have four questions for you.
[1754.38 → 1758.06] And it's not insignificant that you're on a stage, and you're making commitment.
[1758.28 → 1761.54] There's a very few times in your life where you stand in front of a group of people and
[1761.54 → 1762.82] you commit yourself to something.
[1762.82 → 1765.52] You make vows and this is one of those days.
[1766.18 → 1771.18] So let me read for you four invitations of commitment to Jesus Christ, His kingdom, and
[1771.18 → 1771.72] our church.
[1772.48 → 1776.42] So first, do you love Jesus Christ?
[1777.36 → 1780.64] Do you want to make following Him the goal of the rest of your life?
[1781.56 → 1787.10] Do you trust Him as the one who saves you from sin and with repentance and joy embrace
[1787.10 → 1788.98] Him as the Lord of your life?
[1788.98 → 1795.00] Secondly, do you believe that this word is God's word?
[1795.88 → 1800.58] It is the true story of the whole world, trustworthy and true, and it brings us into contact with
[1800.58 → 1802.44] the Saviour of all, and that is Jesus Christ.
[1804.04 → 1810.34] Third, do you promise to do all that you can with the help of the Holy Spirit to strengthen
[1810.34 → 1815.86] your love and commitment to Jesus Christ by sharing faithfully in the life of this church,
[1815.86 → 1820.66] honouring and submitting to its authority as you grow in discipleship?
[1822.06 → 1828.00] Fourthly and finally, will you commit to growing in your faith, devoting yourselves to the disciplines
[1828.00 → 1832.86] that foster your life in Christ, and seek to use the gifts God has given each of you
[1832.86 → 1836.98] to serve His kingdom purposes and make Jesus known in this city?
[1839.24 → 1840.44] Zoe, what is your answer?
[1840.94 → 1841.94] Thank you, God helping me.
[1842.28 → 1843.52] Kennedy, what is your answer?
[1844.30 → 1845.62] Thank you, God helping me.
[1845.86 → 1847.00] May, what is your answer?
[1847.50 → 1848.84] I do, God helping me.
[1849.34 → 1850.44] Ryan, what is your answer?
[1850.62 → 1851.76] I do, God helping me.
[1852.28 → 1853.34] Alex, what is your answer?
[1853.46 → 1854.60] I do, God helping me.
[1855.20 → 1856.36] Timothy, what is your answer?
[1857.56 → 1861.28] Oh, God helping me.
[1861.66 → 1861.94] Amen.
[1862.22 → 1862.76] Thank you, Timothy.
[1864.40 → 1868.48] Well, Hope, at this time I'm going to invite you to stand, because it's true what they say.
[1868.52 → 1870.94] It takes a village to raise a child.
[1870.94 → 1881.72] And I would say that every season of life, whether you are young or old, you need a community of faith to nurture you, to challenge you, to rebuke you, to pray with you.
[1881.72 → 1888.54] And these six people at our stage, how they've been formed is not accidental, and their future formation will not be accidental.
[1888.54 → 1895.32] So we're making a commitment to come alongside them as Christ gives us opportunity to join them in discipleship and mission.
[1896.18 → 1900.00] So Hope Community Church, do you receive these as members of our church?
[1900.64 → 1910.72] Do you promise to pray for them, care for them, encourage them, and walk alongside them as fellow brothers and sisters in Christ to make Jesus Christ known in our city?
[1911.02 → 1912.58] Hope Community Church, what is your answer?
[1913.18 → 1915.12] We do, God helping us.
[1915.12 → 1915.88] Amen.
[1916.10 → 1916.70] You may be seated.
[1919.82 → 1921.36] At this time, you can also be seated.
[1921.48 → 1924.90] I'm going to invite our students, one by one, to share their testimonies.
[1925.36 → 1926.46] So let me just get you set up here.
[1930.38 → 1932.42] Zoe is the brave one who goes first.
[1941.42 → 1944.84] Hi, I'm Zoe, and this is my testimony.
[1945.12 → 1950.22] I've been a Christian my whole life, or to be more precise, I've believed in God my whole life.
[1950.58 → 1953.82] I grew up in a pretty stereotypical Christian household.
[1954.02 → 1956.18] We read the Bible, prayed, and went to church weekly.
[1956.72 → 1962.10] My parents are and were great examples to me on what a Christian does and how a Christian should act.
[1963.10 → 1967.24] Throughout elementary school and middle school, I believed in Jesus, but I was a lukewarm Christian,
[1967.60 → 1970.24] someone who didn't spread the gospel or do devotions on my own time.
[1970.68 → 1971.88] I hadn't owned my faith yet.
[1971.96 → 1973.20] It was just like a family tradition.
[1974.22 → 1977.16] One of my first memories I had with Jesus was in worship at youth.
[1977.34 → 1980.52] I was probably in grade four or five, and it was a dark room, and we worshipped.
[1980.82 → 1983.24] It was a very new Jesus-high feeling, I felt.
[1983.54 → 1988.44] But I didn't take the hint from God that he alone could fill my cup, so I kept on in my worldly ways.
[1988.44 → 1994.26] In the last year, I can't say I've had one huge experience that made me end up on this stage doing a profession of faith,
[1994.38 → 1998.06] which is way out of my comfort zone, more just like a steady incline.
[1998.78 → 2000.76] When I was in grade eight, I had a very rough year.
[2000.98 → 2003.96] I only had one friend at the time, and it was in high school for the first time,
[2004.08 → 2007.40] and all my classes were subjects that I did not excel in, like math and French.
[2008.72 → 2010.66] During this time, I was pretty far from God.
[2010.82 → 2014.72] I didn't believe, I still believed, but I didn't know him on a personal level.
[2014.72 → 2017.84] Throughout the year, I had bad anxiety and very overwhelming thoughts.
[2018.10 → 2021.70] At the end of the year, I started praying for a good Christian friend, and God answered my prayers.
[2022.12 → 2026.84] He gave me Raya, and at the beginning of the year, Raya, at the beginning of the year.
[2027.04 → 2031.98] With Raya, I grew my faith and got to have a physical person who reminded me to connect with God and to trust him.
[2032.54 → 2035.46] Throughout this year, my anxiety has gone down, and I've trusted God.
[2035.60 → 2040.50] I also had the special privilege of having a friend to grow with, and now my faith is stronger than ever.
[2040.50 → 2046.98] So now I stand on this stage, and I can confidently say that even in the toughest times, God is always working behind the scenes.
[2047.54 → 2052.16] It may take years for you to understand, but God's plan is a hundred times better than what you can imagine.
[2052.60 → 2057.86] One thing that really helped me in my faith was reading the Bible, which was really hard for me because I knew the main plot.
[2058.00 → 2059.98] It's like reading a book where you've already watched the movie.
[2059.98 → 2064.98] I started reading in August, and now I'm in Psalms.
[2065.10 → 2068.64] Psalm 16 really stood out to me, so I'm going to read a portion of it to end my testimony.
[2069.12 → 2071.00] This is Psalm 16, 5, verse 11.
[2071.50 → 2073.60] Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup.
[2073.80 → 2074.76] You make my lot secure.
[2075.20 → 2077.38] Your boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places.
[2078.00 → 2079.52] Surely I have delightful inheritance.
[2079.84 → 2081.40] I will praise the Lord who counsels me.
[2081.52 → 2082.98] Even at night, my heart instructs me.
[2083.12 → 2084.66] I keep my eyes always on the Lord.
[2085.10 → 2086.94] With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
[2086.94 → 2091.40] Therefore, my heart is God and my tongue rejoices.
[2091.60 → 2097.76] My body will rest secure, because you will not abandon me in the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful ones see decay.
[2098.12 → 2103.14] You make known to me the path of life and will fill me with joy in your presence with eternal life at your right hand.
[2103.54 → 2103.94] Thank you.
[2113.46 → 2116.28] Okay, I'm Raya, for those who don't know me.
[2116.94 → 2118.28] So, yeah.
[2118.90 → 2123.74] I grew up in a very Christian family, and the belief in God was never something that had wavered for me.
[2124.88 → 2130.90] I did the prayer of faith when I was three or four, and was aided in that by my mom and my five-year-old brother's best friend.
[2132.18 → 2139.02] Through most of my life, I've been a halfway Christian, which means that I didn't devote myself to God, but I also didn't fully shy away from him.
[2139.02 → 2143.90] I would like to share a couple of key faith-defining moments in my life.
[2143.90 → 2151.66] So, when I was younger, I used to pray because it was a means to an end, not because of the relationship that I got from it with God.
[2151.66 → 2157.62] When I was in grade four, I had a panic attack because I was super upset that my family cat had died.
[2158.42 → 2160.50] It got so bad that I felt like I couldn't breathe.
[2160.90 → 2163.54] As a last-ditch attempt, I decided to pray for aid.
[2163.54 → 2169.02] In that exact second that I was praying, I felt a wave of peace and calm wash over and envelop me.
[2169.68 → 2172.22] My breathing slowed, and I truly felt peace-filled.
[2172.86 → 2175.72] But even after that, I still didn't prioritize my faith.
[2176.02 → 2179.50] I had started caring less and less about praying, going to church, etc.
[2179.50 → 2182.92] As a result, my daily life started to suffer.
[2183.48 → 2187.70] I started caring more and more about what everybody else, but God thought about me.
[2188.58 → 2190.44] Panic attacks started becoming more frequent.
[2190.82 → 2191.88] Anxiety was constant.
[2192.10 → 2192.88] Grades were worsening.
[2193.14 → 2194.34] Eating was becoming difficult.
[2194.96 → 2197.90] And my self-criticizing mind started killing me from the inside.
[2198.82 → 2206.06] As I prioritized non-Christian activities, my spiritual health, mental health, physical health, and general well-being started to suffer.
[2206.06 → 2215.48] I was, however, encouraged by Mrs. Green at our weekly violin-slash-my-version-of-a-therapy session to start praying and reading the Bible.
[2215.98 → 2219.84] But it wasn't until a year later that I finally started taking her advice.
[2220.38 → 2226.36] There have been so many moments where I've seen the faith of others, and that's helped me with my own faith, and that's led us to last September.
[2227.34 → 2230.98] But during September, Jesus removed some of the bad influences in my life.
[2231.26 → 2235.66] God also gave me a true Christian buddy who was at a similar faith level as me.
[2236.06 → 2241.32] Together, we helped to build up each other's faith through encouragement, reminders, Instagram Reels, and advice.
[2242.36 → 2247.10] Zoe helped me so much with my faith and currently helps me to do check-ins with myself and God.
[2247.58 → 2250.46] We turned our friendship from a worldly one to a Christian one.
[2251.28 → 2257.18] Because God brought her into my life, I started praying, reading the Bible, and had a deeper relationship with God.
[2257.80 → 2262.04] In two months, I started genuinely living my life for and with God.
[2262.04 → 2268.70] It doesn't mean that all of my problems are now gone like I used to pray for, but it does mean that I have the strength to navigate them with God.
[2269.66 → 2276.44] For me, this baptism means that I get to accept the faith that I was raised into, not just as a child's promise, but as a true navigation point.
[2277.34 → 2280.56] This baptism is the beginning of me taking up my cross daily.
[2280.56 → 2287.06] I would like to end my testimony with a Bible verse from Matthew 16, verse 24 to 26.
[2288.18 → 2289.68] Then Jesus said to his disciples,
[2290.14 → 2294.40] Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.
[2294.84 → 2299.24] For whoever wants to save their lives will lose it, but whoever loses their lives for me will find it.
[2299.72 → 2303.62] What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world yet forfeit their soul?
[2304.08 → 2306.22] Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
[2306.22 → 2307.58] Amen.
[2307.58 → 2309.58] Hi.
[2318.72 → 2321.52] My name is Kennedy, and I am a Christian.
[2322.10 → 2327.18] I believe that Jesus Christ came to save the world, and he died in order to give us life.
[2328.48 → 2330.14] I was raised in a Christian household.
[2330.92 → 2335.80] We went to church, and we read the Bible and did devotions, and we prayed before meals, all the things.
[2335.80 → 2338.92] I never knew anything but Christianity.
[2339.94 → 2347.34] I actually remember a moment when I was young when I first became aware that not everyone was Christian.
[2347.76 → 2352.68] It was like a conscious realization I had that not everyone in the world was a Christian.
[2353.18 → 2356.52] And of course I ran to tell my mom this was a big revelation for me.
[2357.08 → 2362.20] Little me just couldn't understand why anyone wouldn't be Christian or wouldn't want to be Christian.
[2362.20 → 2369.64] I would say growing up in my childhood I was like a casual Christian.
[2370.28 → 2375.54] I was Christian once removed, sharing a faith with my parents yet not yet having my own faith.
[2377.78 → 2385.92] I, during quarantine, which is about spring of 2020, I don't remember exactly when it happened or what it happened, but something hit me.
[2385.92 → 2388.40] I was a Christian.
[2389.48 → 2393.66] I wasn't just raised to believe this, but I actually really did believe this.
[2394.26 → 2396.16] And because of that I needed to take action.
[2397.04 → 2401.62] I needed to be active in my faith and really get to know my Saviour on a personal level.
[2401.62 → 2413.70] So, I began to pray regularly, and I tried to read the Bible and think of church less like the most boring hour of my week.
[2414.48 → 2417.62] And more like an opportunity to learn and grow my faith.
[2417.86 → 2418.44] Which it is.
[2419.74 → 2423.42] I started attending youth very regularly and I volunteered.
[2424.24 → 2426.78] And that's when I really started to get to know God better.
[2426.78 → 2438.60] 2021 to 2022, when I was in grade 10, Misha, she's our youth pastor, challenged the youth to read the whole Bible cover to cover in the school year.
[2439.34 → 2441.28] And she offered us $100 to do it.
[2443.22 → 2450.08] Naturally, I accepted because I wanted to read the Bible and scripture more consistently and also money.
[2450.08 → 2455.50] It was a lot of reading every day, but I did it.
[2455.82 → 2458.96] I finished the last chapter of Revelation on the last day of school.
[2459.96 → 2462.46] And God showed me a lot through that experience.
[2463.46 → 2467.06] He taught me to look at scripture as one whole story.
[2467.60 → 2469.26] One complete story.
[2469.40 → 2470.78] And that really changed my perspective.
[2472.54 → 2476.02] After that, I continued to work on my faith and relationship with God.
[2476.02 → 2481.82] Practicing spiritual habits and learning more about what Christianity is and what it means for me to be a Christian.
[2483.16 → 2488.22] More recently, Jesus and God has been teaching me to be more comfortable talking about my faith.
[2488.88 → 2489.44] Like right now.
[2490.28 → 2492.30] Particularly with people who don't share it.
[2493.88 → 2497.56] I have recognized how broken this world is.
[2498.20 → 2500.82] How broken its people are and how broken I am.
[2500.82 → 2506.16] And through that, I've realized how desperately we all need Jesus.
[2506.84 → 2509.30] How the world needs Jesus and how I need Jesus.
[2510.86 → 2520.14] And that's why it's easier for me to say that I believe, and I'm ready, and I'm excited to give my life to Jesus and see what he does with it.
[2520.88 → 2521.44] Thank you.
[2521.44 → 2522.44] Thank you.
[2530.82 → 2531.64] Hey guys.
[2531.74 → 2532.44] My name is May.
[2533.18 → 2535.48] I'm going to be sharing the story of how I found God.
[2536.12 → 2538.86] So, I did not grow up in the church.
[2538.96 → 2540.54] I didn't grow up going to church with my family.
[2540.68 → 2543.88] And I didn't particularly grow up in like a religious household.
[2545.88 → 2546.86] Heart's beating so fast.
[2547.60 → 2552.64] But however, without knowing it, God was leading me to youth groups in elementary school.
[2553.82 → 2557.30] And like I would go with like my friends like once a month.
[2557.30 → 2563.04] And growing up, I was introduced to prayer and what the Bible was like by my dad.
[2563.12 → 2564.92] Like we would pray before bed every night.
[2565.70 → 2568.68] So, I did have some idea of God.
[2568.94 → 2572.72] And like I always grew up believing in a higher power.
[2572.84 → 2577.24] Like there was some being that was more powerful than humans.
[2579.10 → 2581.14] I did not know who Jesus was.
[2581.52 → 2584.96] And I did not know what it meant to follow him and what being a Christian was.
[2584.96 → 2588.48] So, quarantine was the spark.
[2588.64 → 2590.80] I feel like quarantine was the spark of a lot of things.
[2590.88 → 2592.82] Because that was a fascinating time for everybody.
[2594.90 → 2596.90] But quarantine was the time God spoke to me.
[2597.04 → 2599.76] And it was the time when I found him.
[2600.08 → 2604.16] So, before quarantine happened, I was struggling with things like idolization.
[2604.92 → 2607.88] Idolization meaning I was like a former Cardi B fan.
[2607.98 → 2609.48] And if you don't know who Cardi B is, good.
[2609.48 → 2617.80] So, I was struggling with like idolization, friendship issues, addiction, like addiction to social media.
[2619.48 → 2624.36] Pursuing the wrong kind of guys, you know, not Christian relationships.
[2626.44 → 2627.50] Etc.
[2627.50 → 2634.38] So, before and during quarantine, like I felt really lost and lonely just because of what the whole world was going through.
[2634.62 → 2636.74] And I did not know who to trust.
[2637.94 → 2642.90] And as much as I do not particularly like social media, it did help me in this way.
[2643.30 → 2646.92] Because around springtime of 2020, I was like scrolling on it.
[2646.96 → 2651.48] And I discovered like a few people on there who like they just came up on my For You page.
[2651.48 → 2656.02] And they were talking about how like spiritual stuff and how like angels watch over us.
[2656.14 → 2659.00] And at that moment, I was like, oh yeah, like angels from God.
[2659.14 → 2661.16] There are demons from the devil and there are angels from God.
[2661.22 → 2664.20] Like I know this stuff and I believe in this stuff somewhat.
[2664.90 → 2670.52] And so, when I heard that like angels do watch over us, I felt a sense of like protected, like protection.
[2670.70 → 2671.36] Like I'm protected.
[2672.02 → 2673.56] And I felt like a sense of peace.
[2673.56 → 2685.30] So, I thought to myself, like if I believe in a higher power like God, I should turn to God about my situation and about what the world is currently going through.
[2686.18 → 2696.00] And if I believe that there is an afterlife and that God is more knowledgeable and powerful than us, then I should learn more about that and what that would mean for me.
[2697.24 → 2701.02] So, shortly after that, I became, like I was on a prayer battle.
[2701.02 → 2706.22] I was praying like all the time and I started seeing like more of like the beauty in life.
[2706.90 → 2716.82] And I started feeling more like my true self because I was becoming who God was calling me to be when I started following him and educating myself about like God.
[2716.90 → 2718.74] Like I was becoming who he wanted me to be.
[2718.74 → 2729.38] So, back when I was on social media, I began following Christian influencers to educate myself since like many in-person things were shut down.
[2729.50 → 2732.02] Like that was the only kind of way I could learn.
[2733.86 → 2738.08] And this continued all throughout the summer of 2020, like till the end of 2020.
[2738.08 → 2745.42] And till the end of 2020, that transition to 2021, like that was like, okay, life was getting kind of rough.
[2745.74 → 2748.26] Things didn't feel like butterflies and sparkles anymore.
[2748.42 → 2757.72] You know, I heard this saying like a long time ago that when Jesus gives you a new beginning, he has to bring everything to the dirt again before he can rebuild it.
[2757.76 → 2758.68] And that's what he did for me.
[2758.76 → 2761.00] Like my life was getting rough because he was rebuilding it.
[2761.00 → 2770.92] God removed many people from my life who were not meant to be in it, which definitely hurt because some of these people, like I thought were going to be in my life forever.
[2772.60 → 2776.84] But I knew that it was for a better peace, like a better peace of mind.
[2778.80 → 2785.38] He also opened doors to new, many new relationships that were needed in my life, which brought me closer to Jesus.
[2785.38 → 2792.38] Just like the door he opened when he called me to this church randomly after school that day.
[2793.18 → 2795.46] And I met a bunch of lovely people here.
[2797.68 → 2805.34] My whole, like after I started learning about God, like my whole vision on life started to change because God provided me with like an actual purpose.
[2806.04 → 2807.86] And he provided me with true joy.
[2808.92 → 2812.72] And my whole vision on life changed along with my opinions.
[2812.72 → 2816.38] Like I knew, and I wanted my home to be in heaven with God.
[2818.12 → 2821.84] And shortly after that, like I found out what persecution felt like.
[2822.56 → 2827.28] Because like when you follow Jesus, like not everyone's going to, you know, love you for that.
[2828.52 → 2831.38] So I soon found out like what that felt like.
[2831.70 → 2835.38] People have hated on me and laughed at me for my beliefs like at school.
[2837.20 → 2839.30] But Jesus does not call us to be like the world.
[2839.42 → 2840.62] He is love, and he is truth.
[2840.62 → 2842.50] And he calls us to share that.
[2842.60 → 2847.16] Like even if others will hate you for it, like he calls us to share that with the world.
[2850.96 → 2851.36] Yeah.
[2851.48 → 2855.50] So what that means for me now is like I'm still learning, and I will never be perfect.
[2855.84 → 2857.60] But I'm grateful to have a saviour.
[2857.60 → 2860.32] Who is perfect.
[2862.32 → 2863.60] He saved me from lots.
[2863.74 → 2866.66] All those things that I said in the beginning, like idolization, addiction.
[2867.28 → 2868.30] Those are like so broad.
[2868.38 → 2870.80] Like he saved me from so many things like in those things.
[2871.20 → 2876.30] I look at me back in 2019, and I'm like, wow, like some of the things I did were like really toxic.
[2878.94 → 2880.06] So, yeah.
[2880.06 → 2882.08] And all I had to do was call on him.
[2882.14 → 2883.98] All I had to do was call on God.
[2885.64 → 2891.46] So, now like I follow Jesus because every time I feel like I'm drowning, he pulls me out of the water.
[2891.72 → 2893.22] And I know what it's like to breathe again.
[2893.76 → 2894.18] Thank you.
[2894.18 → 2924.16] Thank you.
[2924.18 → 2925.26] Thank you.
[2929.82 → 2930.62] Thank you.
[2930.62 → 2931.30] Thank you.
[2943.72 → 2952.28] Thank you.
[2952.28 → 2956.46] with a lot of love. Another group of people who's had influence, although not through
[2956.46 → 2960.66] sharing the word, are the friends I've met at school. They've had many conversations
[2960.66 → 2966.22] with me about the faith, and I have felt very comfortable sharing with them. In addition,
[2966.22 → 2970.28] to my family, this church has had a huge influence on me. Not only have the sermons been quite
[2970.28 → 2974.00] good, but I have also attended senior youth here at Hope, and the small conversations
[2974.00 → 2979.00] I have had here I have never found anywhere else. Both environments are extremely positive,
[2979.00 → 2985.00] and I've learned many things going to both. I have come to the realization that my reason
[2985.00 → 2988.82] for following Jesus is the evidence from those in my life, from the people who have followed
[2988.82 → 2993.86] him before me, because of the godlessness of our society that brings it closer to destruction
[2993.86 → 2998.50] every day. These things are all evident in my life, and I hope you to realize that the
[2998.50 → 3002.68] last two reasons can be seen everywhere. I believe that Jesus is the foundation of the
[3002.68 → 3007.52] church, the saviour of the world, and the conclusion of God's redemption plan. I also believe that
[3007.52 → 3011.28] God is omnipotent and good, that he gave his one and only son to die for the sins of the
[3011.28 → 3015.84] world. And lastly, I believe that Jesus rose from the grave and descended to heaven, where
[3015.84 → 3021.52] he now sits at the right hand of the Father. Now, I was going to read 1 Corinthians 3, verse
[3021.52 → 3026.16] 10 to 15, but after how short my testimony was, I think I'll include a few other verses.
[3026.16 → 3033.36] All right, so starting from verse 5, yeah, Paul says,
[3033.36 → 3038.80] What after all is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants through whom you have come to believe,
[3038.80 → 3044.08] as the Lord has assigned to each his task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been
[3044.08 → 3049.34] making it grow. So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who makes
[3049.34 → 3054.48] things grow. The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and they'll each be
[3054.48 → 3060.00] rewarded according to their own labour. For we are co-workers in God's service. You are God's field,
[3060.24 → 3064.96] God's building. By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder,
[3065.44 → 3070.24] and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care, for no one can lay any
[3070.24 → 3074.90] foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. If anyone builds on this foundation
[3074.90 → 3081.46] using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw, their work will be shown for what it is,
[3081.46 → 3085.94] because the day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the
[3085.94 → 3090.74] quality of each person's work. If what has been built survives, the builder will receive a reward.
[3090.74 → 3096.58] If it is burnt up, the builder will suffer loss, but yet be saved, even though it was one escaping
[3096.58 → 3102.66] through the flames. This verse has been sticking in my mind for quite some time, and I realize it has
[3102.66 → 3119.94] called me and many other people to share the word of the gospel with others. Thank you.
[3119.94 → 3125.22] Thank you.
[3125.22 → 3129.22] Thank you.
[3129.22 → 3134.50] Thank you.
[3134.50 → 3138.50] Thank you.
[3138.50 → 3142.50] Thank you.
[3142.50 → 3148.50] Thank you.
[3148.50 → 3161.78] Thank you.
[3161.78 → 3165.78] Thank you.
[3165.78 → 3179.06] Thank you.
[3179.06 → 3187.06] Hello. My name is Tim.
[3187.06 → 3208.34] I was born into a clothing family. I am not unkind.
[3208.34 → 3229.62] My parents really take care of me. I was the firstborn.
[3229.62 → 3242.34] My siblings Alex and Andrew Arius.
[3242.34 → 3255.94] Andrew plays with me at home.
[3255.94 → 3269.74] When I was a baby, I began to talk to
[3269.74 → 3271.38] I was the fifth age of the father family in with my sister.
[3271.38 → 3273.74] She really covered him. How ended her husband clip and wrote and made disciples of support
[3273.74 → 3276.08] to have had him.
[3276.08 → 3280.34] And there was the first time that she checked.
[3280.34 → 3284.26] My parents were not united that in sustenance wealthy,
[3284.26 → 3289.62] where I decided to go away.
[3289.62 → 3290.90] To be a man in ANY way.
[3290.90 → 3292.06] This is zip.
[3292.06 → 3294.94] I have joined a bandana at students.
[3294.94 → 3296.38] Chinese monks, at students' answers chemical,
[3296.38 → 3297.02] said Mike Jen Okay.
[3297.02 → 3298.14] ę HAI fans have also known aً to speak for more people.
[3298.14 → 3328.12] My parents helped me understand the Bible.
[3328.12 → 3358.10] In White Street, I had a family.
[3358.10 → 3364.10] I tried to take him since.
[3364.10 → 3386.10] The school helped me out with trusting these things.
[3386.10 → 3400.10] I was an emotional one I feel very proud.
[3400.10 → 3416.10] I was a swimmer and sad person.
[3416.10 → 3432.10] When I got my brain in the brain, I had a fever.
[3432.10 → 3438.10] And so I was...
[3438.10 → 3444.10] I was...
[3444.10 → 3448.10] I was a kid.
[3448.10 → 3450.10] I was a kid.
[3450.10 → 3452.10] I was a kid.
[3452.10 → 3454.10] I was a kid.
[3454.10 → 3460.10] I was a kid.
[3460.10 → 3462.10] I was a kid.
[3462.10 → 3464.10] I was a kid.
[3464.10 → 3467.10] I was a kid.
[3467.10 → 3468.10] I was a kid.
[3468.10 → 3470.10] I had a very tough time.
[3470.10 → 3484.10] I had a very tough time.
[3484.10 → 3502.10] Was my life enough for me?
[3502.10 → 3514.10] And I couldn't remember things.
[3514.10 → 3526.10] It so very helped me.
[3526.10 → 3538.10] Helped my brain with a bad disease.
[3538.10 → 3548.10] Please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[3548.10 → 3552.10] Please help me.
[3552.10 → 3558.10] And I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[3558.10 → 3576.10] I want to get baptized.
[3576.10 → 3596.10] I want to touch that new life.
[3596.10 → 3616.10] With my new interest in Jesus, I have died of Christ.
[3616.10 → 3632.10] Because he's a bad friend, not me.
[3632.10 → 3660.10] I want to touch all of my life to be trusted to be trusted by the people.
[3660.10 → 3680.10] I want to be rescued from the street.
[3680.10 → 3698.10] Because I want to be with Jesus when I die.
[3698.10 → 3712.10] And he loves everyone so well.
[3712.10 → 3714.10] I want to be with Jesus.
[3714.10 → 3718.10] Thank you.
[3718.10 → 3720.10] Thank you.
[3720.10 → 3724.10] Thank you.
[3724.10 → 3748.10] I'm going to now invite one by one, those of you who are doing professional faith, to stand with me by this baptism bowl.
[3748.10 → 3752.10] Zoe, I'll get you to come up first.
[3752.10 → 3754.10] Zoe, I'll get you to come up first.
[3754.10 → 3760.10] I feel like this morning, almost this afternoon, you need to do some specific remembering.
[3760.10 → 3766.10] And I want you to do your very best to think of yourself as a little baby girl.
[3766.10 → 3774.10] Because there is a day when your mom and dad held you in front of a bowl of baptism.
[3774.10 → 3776.10] And they made promises.
[3776.10 → 3778.10] And your church made promises.
[3778.10 → 3784.10] And ever since that day, the grace of Jesus Christ has been at work in your life.
[3784.10 → 3796.10] And today is really a day when all of us, we take hold of this event that was in your past, and recognize that today's profession of faith is a testimony to the faithfulness of God.
[3796.10 → 3817.10] So I'm going to invite you to actually put your hands in this bowl, and I'm just going to pray with you quietly for a minute as we remember that together.
[3817.10 → 3818.10] Amen.
[3818.10 → 3820.10] Amen.
[3820.10 → 3828.10] And just a minute, the parents who held you over this baptism bowl are going to pray for you.
[3828.10 → 3829.10] But you can take a seat.
[3829.10 → 3831.10] I'm going to invite Kennedy to do the same.
[3831.10 → 3835.10] Just in case you don't know, these two are sisters, Kennedy and Zoe.
[3835.10 → 3838.10] They had a pretty consistent reputation as they talked about their parents here.
[3838.10 → 3845.10] But Kennedy, I now want to invite you to put your hands in this bowl of baptism, recognizing the commitment that your parents and your community have made to you,
[3845.10 → 3850.10] and the testimony that today is, of the faithfulness of God to your own baptism.
[3850.10 → 3870.10] And may.
[3870.10 → 3871.10] And may.
[3871.10 → 3879.10] One of the interesting things about may is that even though she has not grown up in the church, she was baptized.
[3879.10 → 3888.10] And it's an interesting story to see the grace of Christ entering at a unique season in your life, and in some sense honouring the way in which your parents,
[3888.10 → 3895.10] and I don't know where your dad is, he's right there, the prayers they prayed over your life and your mom, the love they have for you,
[3895.10 → 3899.10] and the way that Jesus has shown up and revealed himself to you.
[3899.10 → 3905.10] And so now at this time, may, would you put your hands in the bowl as a testimony to the faithfulness of God to your baptism.
[3905.10 → 3928.10] All right, now we're going to include a little bit more water.
[3928.10 → 3935.10] Raya, I think that you are the first one who's going to get baptized, so I just invite you to take your boots off.
[3935.10 → 3941.10] And sit in the tub facing this way.
[3941.10 → 3947.10] It's not an ice bath if anyone's curious.
[3947.10 → 3966.10] So Raya Frey, I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[3966.10 → 3987.10] All right, Alex, you're next.
[3987.10 → 3990.10] All right, all of a sudden this baptism tub feels small.
[3990.10 → 3995.10] It's right in the front.
[3995.10 → 4006.10] Alex Hogan Dore, I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[4006.10 → 4019.10] Now Timothy.
[4019.10 → 4035.10] Amen.
[4035.10 → 4038.10] Amen.
[4038.10 → 4039.10] Amen.
[4039.10 → 4041.10] Amen.
[4041.10 → 4042.10] Amen.
[4044.10 → 4045.10] Amen.
[4045.10 → 4054.60] Timothy Hendon, I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[4075.10 → 4081.08] At this time, I'm going to invite the parents and youth leaders of those who've done professional faith and baptism.
[4081.08 → 4083.36] We're going to surround these students in prayer.
[4083.94 → 4087.76] And so we're just going to find space on this stage somehow and pray together.
[4094.52 → 4096.80] In fact, if you could stand in the middle here, students.
[4096.80 → 4105.12] And just reach in, place your hands on them.
[4105.42 → 4106.14] Let's pray together.
[4122.02 → 4126.40] These are just a few people that represent a lifetime of care,
[4126.40 → 4128.14] a prayer of discipleship.
[4128.94 → 4131.56] And I just want to acknowledge that those of you who are here,
[4132.34 → 4135.98] the way that God's used you as parents, as friends, as youth leaders,
[4136.44 → 4140.96] to forge the faith and how the grace of Jesus works through ordinary people,
[4141.82 → 4145.50] ordinary homes, ordinary circumstances to bring about a day like today.
[4146.22 → 4147.44] So I've got a roaming mic.
[4147.60 → 4149.18] If you want to pray, just raise your hand.
[4149.22 → 4149.98] I'll pass it to you.
[4150.28 → 4153.02] And I will close our prayer when we're good and done.
[4153.10 → 4153.96] Would you join us in prayer?
[4156.40 → 4163.24] Father, we thank you for your goodness.
[4164.94 → 4168.88] We thank you that the next generation takes hold of Jesus in faith.
[4170.34 → 4171.88] And we pray over their futures.
[4172.62 → 4174.14] We pray over their relationships.
[4174.14 → 4178.04] We pray that your name would be honoured for the rest of their lives.
[4178.04 → 4208.02] We pray over their prayers.
[4208.02 → 4209.02] Lord, we pray for your forgiveness.
[4209.02 → 4210.02] We pray over their prayers.
[4210.02 → 4211.02] We pray for your forgiveness.
[4211.02 → 4212.02] We pray for your forgiveness.
[4212.02 → 4214.02] We pray for our faithfulness through our lives, Lord.
[4214.64 → 4219.08] Lord, we pray for Zoe and Kennedy, that they may hear your word,
[4219.68 → 4221.96] that they may continue to follow your voice,
[4222.12 → 4225.84] that you may continue to lead them in their future, Lord,
[4225.88 → 4229.72] that you will continue to guide them and be near unto them,
[4229.76 → 4233.60] and they may feel your presence and your guidance throughout their lives, Lord.
[4233.60 → 4240.00] Lord Jesus, we want to thank you for all that are a part of this journey.
[4240.58 → 4243.50] Pastor Dave has mentioned already that it does take a village,
[4243.50 → 4248.98] and we think of the grandparents, their aunts and uncles,
[4249.54 → 4253.64] their aunts and uncles that are part of not biology,
[4253.64 → 4259.10] but extended family that have been grafted into our family, Lord.
[4260.72 → 4262.56] We think of this church.
[4262.80 → 4264.96] We think of New West Christian Reformed Church
[4264.96 → 4270.70] and all the people that have helped raise them to be where they are today, Lord.
[4271.42 → 4273.70] We think of the teachers in their lives.
[4273.70 → 4277.26] We think of the youth leaders.
[4277.66 → 4283.28] We think of the mentors through CCK,
[4284.10 → 4288.88] through all the different aspects of this church, Lord,
[4288.92 → 4292.44] and we're so grateful for such a large community that can surround us
[4292.44 → 4298.44] and be part of our extended family that helps raise your children
[4298.44 → 4303.34] to know you and to love you and to follow you, Lord.
[4303.42 → 4308.88] And we pray for a continued community to surround and guide them all here, Lord,
[4309.00 → 4313.80] to lead them and to guide them.
[4314.24 → 4315.44] We thank you for this.
[4315.44 → 4332.28] Our Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have given the gift of baptism to your church,
[4333.28 → 4342.26] that we can be reminded of our connection with all of your children through history till today.
[4345.44 → 4352.38] that we can be reminded of our forgiveness of sins that have been washed away
[4352.38 → 4355.94] by the gift of your Son, Jesus.
[4361.66 → 4367.52] And we can be reminded that we have been buried with him
[4367.52 → 4372.46] and will be raised with him.
[4375.44 → 4385.24] I pray for these six people who have professed faith in you this morning.
[4385.38 → 4389.72] We pray that you would continue to work in their lives,
[4390.44 → 4395.76] to guide them in a world that is full of lies and deceit,
[4396.76 → 4399.56] where evil is portrayed as good
[4399.56 → 4403.76] and virtue is considered to be a vice.
[4403.76 → 4408.02] We ask that you would help them to understand your truth
[4408.02 → 4412.22] and that they'd be able to discern truth from lie
[4412.22 → 4415.54] and would be able to remain faithful to you.
[4419.38 → 4421.48] We thank you for your goodness to us
[4421.48 → 4427.62] and we ask you to bless these people who have made commitments today.
[4427.62 → 4429.50] In Jesus' name, amen.
[4437.42 → 4439.00] God, I just ask that you
[4439.00 → 4443.00] continue to bless each of these people
[4443.00 → 4445.74] who have been baptized and professed their faith today.
[4445.74 → 4450.56] that we, their parents, siblings, friends, community,
[4451.40 → 4452.80] that we would walk beside them
[4452.80 → 4456.96] as they discover their purpose that they have in you,
[4457.82 → 4459.20] that you would guide their path
[4459.20 → 4460.84] and lead them into their calling.
[4461.08 → 4463.34] We thank you that they are your children first
[4463.34 → 4466.18] and we thank you for the gift that they are to us.
[4467.18 → 4469.14] We just praise you, Jesus, for this day.
[4469.14 → 4469.20] Amen.
[4469.20 → 4469.26] Amen.
[4469.26 → 4469.28] Amen.
[4469.28 → 4469.30] Amen.
[4469.30 → 4469.32] Amen.
[4469.32 → 4469.36] Amen.
[4469.36 → 4469.38] Amen.
[4475.74 → 4476.74] Amen.
[4476.74 → 4477.74] Amen.
[4485.74 → 4488.24] And so, Father, we close this prayer
[4488.24 → 4491.06] with the words of Hebrews.
[4492.06 → 4493.44] And may the God of peace,
[4493.62 → 4495.32] who through the blood of the eternal covenant
[4495.32 → 4499.04] brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ,
[4499.16 → 4500.68] the great shepherd of the sheep,
[4501.36 → 4503.92] may he equip you with everything good for doing his will.
[4503.92 → 4507.40] And may he work in us what is pleasing to him
[4507.40 → 4508.54] through Jesus Christ,
[4509.10 → 4511.68] to whom be glory forever and ever.
[4511.94 → 4513.64] And together we say, amen.
[4515.24 → 4517.96] I'm going to invite Misha onto the stage,
[4518.12 → 4519.34] wherever Misha is.
[4519.92 → 4520.66] She's right there.
[4521.70 → 4522.96] She's got a few words to share.
[4526.70 → 4528.26] Just a few brief words.
[4528.26 → 4531.42] I just want to say to our students who shared today,
[4531.62 → 4535.14] it is an honour to get to be part of the journey.
[4535.38 → 4536.20] And that is what it is.
[4536.28 → 4538.90] Today is not, oh, life is going to be perfect for you
[4538.90 → 4540.48] when you leave this place.
[4540.98 → 4542.94] Life is hard, and it's full of challenges.
[4543.28 → 4546.54] But hold fast to what you have said today.
[4547.24 → 4548.60] We have a small gift for you.
[4548.94 → 4550.42] And it's a little note for me,
[4550.48 → 4552.50] a little certificate just to remind you.
[4552.60 → 4554.24] Put that somewhere maybe in your room
[4554.24 → 4556.54] or in a hallway in your house to remind you.
[4556.78 → 4557.96] And we also have a book for you
[4557.96 → 4561.06] that's some questions that often come up
[4561.06 → 4562.94] of what do I believe about this?
[4563.04 → 4564.84] And so it's just something to help you navigate
[4564.84 → 4567.16] as you continue to grow your faith
[4567.16 → 4569.36] and as you continue to share your faith,
[4569.52 → 4571.26] especially with friends and family,
[4571.82 → 4574.32] neighbours, whoever you come into contact with
[4574.32 → 4574.72] in your life.
[4574.80 → 4575.98] And so, yeah, I just wanted to say
[4575.98 → 4578.22] you are so loved and supported
[4578.22 → 4580.14] and we cannot wait to continue this journey
[4580.14 → 4581.14] with you at Youth.
[4584.24 → 4593.24] As you receive your gifts,
[4593.30 → 4595.06] you are welcome to find your way back to your seats.
[4604.48 → 4605.78] And on behalf of this church,
[4605.86 → 4607.74] I want to say welcome to Hope Community Church.
[4608.34 → 4610.98] We look forward to seeing what God has in store for you,
[4610.98 → 4612.18] both in terms of your formation
[4612.18 → 4615.04] and in terms of your gifts being served for His kingdom.
[4617.26 → 4618.80] You can welcome them one more time.
[4629.28 → 4630.82] I also believe at this time
[4630.82 → 4634.08] our very patient and excited children
[4634.08 → 4636.78] are now invited upstairs to Cornerstone.
[4636.78 → 4636.98] So...
[4636.98 → 4641.50] That's it.
[4642.18 → 4653.46] This is not a long enough cord.
[4656.74 → 4659.04] I've had the privilege of worshipping
[4659.04 → 4661.10] with some African brothers and sisters
[4661.10 → 4662.30] in Kenya in the past.
[4662.70 → 4664.90] So this is the point where you start dancing
[4664.90 → 4666.10] that we're still here.
[4666.40 → 4666.62] Okay?
[4666.62 → 4669.00] My name is Valerie,
[4669.24 → 4671.86] and I will share with you the community prayer.
[4672.52 → 4674.64] I just want to mention before I do that
[4674.64 → 4676.82] that we are taking a special offering
[4676.82 → 4679.24] for Cascade Christian Counselling.
[4679.72 → 4681.12] You can do it on the app
[4681.12 → 4683.22] or all the other stuff
[4683.22 → 4685.70] the bean counters have made available to us.
[4685.80 → 4686.26] There it is.
[4686.26 → 4689.42] They are a Christian counselling centre
[4689.42 → 4691.12] rooted in God's word
[4691.12 → 4693.44] as they help people deal with their
[4693.44 → 4696.80] marital, relational, mental health challenges.
[4697.04 → 4698.38] So please give generously.
[4701.54 → 4702.22] Sorry, Bill.
[4702.26 → 4703.08] I know it's a bit long.
[4704.66 → 4706.24] Would you please pray with me?
[4706.24 → 4711.66] Holy, almighty, sovereign king,
[4712.58 → 4715.78] ever-present lord of all that is
[4715.78 → 4717.56] and all that was
[4717.56 → 4718.82] and all that will be,
[4719.52 → 4720.88] we thank you
[4720.88 → 4723.04] that Jesus, the eternal,
[4724.20 → 4726.72] the one who is with you
[4726.72 → 4727.90] and the Holy Spirit,
[4728.60 → 4729.80] that Jesus came low
[4729.80 → 4733.14] and he joined us in our humanity
[4733.14 → 4735.86] as a small and gentle baby.
[4737.16 → 4739.60] And we thank you for living with us,
[4740.22 → 4741.90] for sharing in our suffering.
[4742.98 → 4744.78] We thank you that in your dying
[4744.78 → 4747.26] and by the most profound, deep mystery
[4747.26 → 4748.92] that you defeated death.
[4749.76 → 4750.66] And in rising,
[4751.08 → 4752.46] you display your might
[4752.46 → 4754.72] and sovereignty over all.
[4756.00 → 4758.42] As you appeared to marry in the garden
[4758.42 → 4759.84] on Easter morning,
[4761.06 → 4762.76] she at first didn't recognize
[4762.76 → 4763.80] the risen Jesus.
[4764.30 → 4764.90] But then,
[4765.68 → 4767.14] you spoke her name.
[4768.68 → 4770.86] Speak our name, Father,
[4771.02 → 4772.62] and help us to see you
[4772.62 → 4773.94] as you truly are.
[4775.54 → 4776.64] That you are the humble
[4776.64 → 4779.06] and gentle, loving, forgiving God
[4779.06 → 4780.96] who sees us
[4780.96 → 4782.46] and loves us
[4782.46 → 4785.44] and draws us towards holiness,
[4786.38 → 4788.18] redeeming all our disgraces.
[4789.42 → 4791.24] We thank you for your mercy
[4791.24 → 4793.16] and we thank you for your justice
[4793.16 → 4794.22] and we thank you
[4794.22 → 4795.88] for your transforming,
[4796.60 → 4799.00] restorative power in our lives.
[4801.68 → 4803.14] Work in us
[4803.14 → 4804.22] and through us
[4804.22 → 4805.40] and these six
[4805.40 → 4809.02] that have just publicly proclaimed
[4809.02 → 4811.20] their allegiance to you.
[4811.46 → 4812.40] Work through us
[4812.40 → 4813.62] to usher in a kingdom
[4813.62 → 4816.16] that cares for the desperate
[4816.16 → 4817.12] and the needy
[4817.12 → 4817.78] and the lonely
[4817.78 → 4818.66] and the lost.
[4819.44 → 4821.18] And grant us the humility
[4821.18 → 4823.42] to see that we are also
[4823.42 → 4825.64] counted as the desperate
[4825.64 → 4826.44] and needy
[4826.44 → 4826.96] and lonely
[4826.96 → 4827.70] and lost
[4827.70 → 4829.88] so that we are not tempted
[4829.88 → 4831.64] to be judgmental
[4831.64 → 4832.66] or prideful.
[4833.84 → 4834.84] Convict us
[4834.84 → 4835.72] in the areas
[4835.72 → 4836.88] where we are blind
[4836.88 → 4838.94] and guide us
[4838.94 → 4840.48] to your righteous paths
[4840.48 → 4842.14] so that we may flourish
[4842.14 → 4843.86] and be swept up
[4843.86 → 4845.38] in your blessing on earth
[4845.38 → 4847.42] for the good of all the world.
[4848.58 → 4849.20] We thank you
[4849.20 → 4850.66] for the rhythm of life,
[4851.54 → 4853.76] for six days of work
[4853.76 → 4855.22] and one day of rest.
[4855.78 → 4856.48] We thank you
[4856.48 → 4857.32] for the days,
[4857.48 → 4859.08] for the gifts of celebration,
[4859.56 → 4860.84] the days like this one.
[4861.60 → 4862.20] We thank you
[4862.20 → 4863.30] for Dave and Brittany,
[4863.96 → 4865.02] Levi, Adele,
[4865.22 → 4866.02] Ruben, and Rosie.
[4866.02 → 4867.54] And we ask that you
[4867.54 → 4869.10] enrich their time
[4869.10 → 4869.96] on sabbatical.
[4870.88 → 4872.26] That you infuse them
[4872.26 → 4873.12] with new joy
[4873.12 → 4873.90] and passion
[4873.90 → 4875.34] for your calling
[4875.34 → 4876.34] on their lives.
[4876.76 → 4877.36] And we pray
[4877.36 → 4878.40] that you grant them
[4878.40 → 4880.38] deep rest
[4880.38 → 4881.48] and renewal.
[4882.84 → 4883.70] Anoint Jonathan
[4883.70 → 4884.34] and Moon
[4884.34 → 4886.20] with the fullest measure
[4886.20 → 4887.04] of your spirit
[4887.04 → 4888.36] as they step
[4888.36 → 4889.28] into the space
[4889.28 → 4890.20] left by Dave
[4890.20 → 4890.64] and Brittany.
[4891.58 → 4892.38] May your blessing
[4892.38 → 4893.66] be upon them
[4893.66 → 4895.40] as they lead
[4895.40 → 4896.06] your church.
[4897.38 → 4897.72] God,
[4897.86 → 4898.76] fill Pastor Dave
[4898.76 → 4899.38] right now
[4899.38 → 4900.52] with your words
[4900.52 → 4901.12] of wisdom,
[4901.76 → 4902.14] grace,
[4902.64 → 4903.00] mercy,
[4903.66 → 4903.98] truth,
[4903.98 → 4904.76] and love
[4904.76 → 4906.70] that we may
[4906.70 → 4907.40] go out
[4907.40 → 4908.36] and be light
[4908.36 → 4909.40] in this world.
[4910.22 → 4911.56] In your holy name,
[4912.00 → 4912.22] amen.
[4923.66 → 4932.44] Well, I'm living
[4932.44 → 4933.32] in a preacher's nightmare
[4933.32 → 4935.18] and I say that
[4935.18 → 4936.30] just because I'm aware
[4936.30 → 4937.12] that we have a meal
[4937.12 → 4937.90] after the service
[4937.90 → 4938.50] and some people
[4938.50 → 4939.36] from the first service
[4939.36 → 4940.00] are coming back
[4940.00 → 4940.46] and then there's
[4940.46 → 4941.62] a Korean worship service.
[4942.60 → 4943.52] When I started preaching,
[4943.64 → 4944.38] I have a father-in-law
[4944.38 → 4944.94] who said to me,
[4945.02 → 4945.52] you have to be able
[4945.52 → 4946.28] to preach your sermon
[4946.28 → 4947.12] in a paragraph.
[4947.26 → 4947.58] You should be able
[4947.58 → 4948.32] to summarize your sermon
[4948.32 → 4948.78] in a paragraph.
[4949.00 → 4949.98] And so I'm going to read
[4949.98 → 4951.18] our passage for this morning
[4951.18 → 4952.02] and I'm going to give you
[4952.02 → 4953.38] a short version
[4953.38 → 4953.82] of the sermon.
[4954.68 → 4955.68] So I do want us
[4955.68 → 4956.56] to hear God speak
[4956.56 → 4957.26] by His Word.
[4958.56 → 4959.34] And we're going to read
[4959.34 → 4960.12] from Romans 6
[4960.12 → 4960.78] which is a passage
[4960.78 → 4961.80] that's all about baptism.
[4965.48 → 4966.98] What shall we say then?
[4968.22 → 4969.50] Shall we go on sinning
[4969.50 → 4971.88] so that grace may increase?
[4972.62 → 4973.80] By no means.
[4974.34 → 4974.92] We are those
[4974.92 → 4975.96] who have died to sin.
[4976.04 → 4977.26] How can we live in it
[4977.26 → 4977.84] any longer?
[4978.60 → 4979.42] Or don't you know
[4979.42 → 4980.04] that all of us
[4980.04 → 4980.62] who are baptized
[4980.62 → 4981.66] into Christ Jesus
[4981.66 → 4982.24] were baptized
[4982.24 → 4983.44] into His death?
[4984.14 → 4984.70] We are therefore
[4984.70 → 4985.66] buried with Him
[4985.66 → 4986.46] through baptism
[4986.46 → 4987.08] into death
[4987.08 → 4988.04] in order that just
[4988.04 → 4989.16] as Christ was raised
[4989.16 → 4989.68] from the dead
[4989.68 → 4990.30] through the glory
[4990.30 → 4990.96] of the Father,
[4991.38 → 4992.52] we too may live
[4992.52 → 4993.74] a new life.
[4994.52 → 4995.60] If we've been united
[4995.60 → 4996.16] with Him
[4996.16 → 4997.30] in a death like His,
[4997.36 → 4998.02] we will certainly
[4998.02 → 4999.56] also be united with Him
[4999.56 → 5000.78] in a resurrection
[5000.78 → 5001.66] like His.
[5002.34 → 5002.94] For we know
[5002.94 → 5003.94] that our old self
[5003.94 → 5005.30] was crucified with Him
[5005.30 → 5006.80] so that the body
[5006.80 → 5008.00] ruled by sin
[5008.00 → 5009.10] might be done away with.
[5009.10 → 5010.56] That we should no longer
[5010.56 → 5011.60] be slaves to sin
[5011.60 → 5012.78] because anyone
[5012.78 → 5013.34] who has died
[5013.34 → 5014.44] has been set free
[5014.44 → 5015.02] from sin.
[5015.90 → 5016.80] Now if we died
[5016.80 → 5017.44] with Christ,
[5018.02 → 5018.82] we believe we will
[5018.82 → 5019.90] also live with Him.
[5020.38 → 5020.90] For we know that
[5020.90 → 5021.96] since Christ was raised
[5021.96 → 5022.40] from the dead,
[5022.46 → 5023.74] He cannot die again.
[5024.28 → 5025.10] Death no longer
[5025.10 → 5026.54] has mastery over Him.
[5027.24 → 5028.06] The death He died,
[5028.14 → 5028.86] He died to sin
[5028.86 → 5030.20] once for all.
[5030.66 → 5031.72] But the life He lives,
[5031.78 → 5032.84] He lives to God.
[5033.62 → 5034.58] In the same way,
[5034.68 → 5035.44] count yourselves
[5035.44 → 5036.28] dead to sin,
[5036.28 → 5038.04] but alive to God
[5038.04 → 5038.76] in Christ Jesus.
[5039.54 → 5039.76] Therefore,
[5039.90 → 5040.66] do not let sin
[5040.66 → 5041.88] reign in your mortal bodies
[5041.88 → 5042.70] so that you obey
[5042.70 → 5043.72] its evil desires.
[5044.46 → 5045.14] Do not offer
[5045.14 → 5046.36] any part of yourself
[5046.36 → 5046.94] to sin
[5046.94 → 5047.60] as an instrument
[5047.60 → 5048.34] of wickedness,
[5048.60 → 5049.54] but rather offer
[5049.54 → 5050.72] yourselves to God
[5050.72 → 5052.06] as those who have
[5052.06 → 5052.56] been brought
[5052.56 → 5053.96] from death to life.
[5054.34 → 5055.42] And offer every part
[5055.42 → 5056.32] of yourself to Him
[5056.32 → 5057.52] as an instrument
[5057.52 → 5058.22] of righteousness.
[5059.22 → 5060.48] For sin shall no longer
[5060.48 → 5061.24] be your master
[5061.24 → 5062.68] because you are not
[5062.68 → 5063.42] under the law
[5063.42 → 5065.12] but under grace.
[5067.78 → 5068.96] That opening question
[5068.96 → 5069.90] is such a good one.
[5070.90 → 5071.52] Shall we continue
[5071.52 → 5072.78] in sin so that grace
[5072.78 → 5073.50] may abound?
[5074.26 → 5074.74] It's a question
[5074.74 → 5075.58] that I think some teenagers
[5075.58 → 5076.68] often could ask.
[5077.16 → 5077.74] I had that one
[5077.74 → 5078.48] as a youth pastor.
[5078.58 → 5079.40] You mean to say, Dave,
[5079.44 → 5080.68] that grace is so expansive,
[5081.20 → 5082.54] Jesus' mercy is so good
[5082.54 → 5083.36] that no matter
[5083.36 → 5084.48] how deep sin goes,
[5084.58 → 5085.70] grace meets me there.
[5086.24 → 5087.14] And does that mean then
[5087.14 → 5087.74] that I can kind of
[5087.74 → 5088.76] live how I want,
[5089.34 → 5090.34] do whatever I like,
[5090.74 → 5091.96] do the deathbed conversion,
[5092.08 → 5092.92] and we're good to go?
[5093.72 → 5094.04] Have you ever had
[5094.04 → 5094.52] that question
[5094.52 → 5095.94] rattle through your head?
[5097.34 → 5098.22] And Paul's answer
[5098.22 → 5098.96] to that question
[5098.96 → 5099.48] in our passage
[5099.48 → 5100.26] is so stunning.
[5101.38 → 5102.18] His answer is,
[5102.72 → 5103.52] don't you know
[5103.52 → 5104.62] who you are?
[5105.72 → 5106.46] Don't you know
[5106.46 → 5107.78] what your baptism means?
[5109.00 → 5109.50] Paul says,
[5109.60 → 5110.02] basically,
[5110.18 → 5111.06] when you get baptized,
[5111.42 → 5112.86] you die with Jesus.
[5113.74 → 5114.86] And through your baptism,
[5115.12 → 5116.24] you rise with Jesus.
[5117.02 → 5117.84] The old self
[5117.84 → 5118.90] was buried with Him.
[5118.98 → 5119.64] The old way
[5119.64 → 5120.56] of patterns of life
[5120.56 → 5121.46] was dying with Him.
[5121.46 → 5122.42] And you have now
[5122.42 → 5122.86] been brought
[5122.86 → 5124.94] into a whole new reality.
[5126.34 → 5127.80] You have resurrection life.
[5128.92 → 5129.76] And for the last minute
[5129.76 → 5130.22] of my sermon,
[5130.28 → 5130.78] I'm going to show you
[5130.78 → 5131.86] a diagram that illustrates
[5131.86 → 5132.48] Romans 6.
[5134.66 → 5135.66] This actually brings me
[5135.66 → 5136.44] back to last year,
[5136.52 → 5137.54] the baptisms we did.
[5137.92 → 5138.66] I had the same problem
[5138.66 → 5139.16] in our diagram
[5139.16 → 5139.98] and ran out of time.
[5140.86 → 5141.82] This is Romans 6
[5141.82 → 5142.36] in a diagram.
[5142.48 → 5142.86] I want to thank
[5142.86 → 5143.94] my father-in-law for it.
[5144.26 → 5144.90] In Romans 5,
[5145.00 → 5145.44] Paul says,
[5145.44 → 5145.92] in Adam,
[5146.02 → 5146.72] when he rebelled,
[5146.90 → 5147.72] the whole world
[5147.72 → 5149.10] entered into this reality
[5149.10 → 5149.92] of sin.
[5150.32 → 5151.06] There's exile
[5151.06 → 5152.38] and bondage to the powers.
[5152.80 → 5153.48] There's this reality
[5153.48 → 5154.24] that we are now
[5154.24 → 5156.30] in bondage to sinful ambition,
[5156.52 → 5157.22] sinful desires.
[5157.36 → 5158.04] There are all sorts of
[5158.04 → 5159.42] difficulty in our world.
[5159.94 → 5160.44] That's Adam.
[5160.54 → 5161.16] That's the old age.
[5161.22 → 5162.16] Then comes the new Adam
[5162.16 → 5162.76] named Jesus.
[5163.42 → 5164.68] And by His death,
[5164.96 → 5166.18] symbolized by the cross there,
[5166.58 → 5167.46] He brought an end
[5167.46 → 5168.74] to the power of sin.
[5169.40 → 5171.64] He dealt with the full extent
[5171.64 → 5173.30] of its destructive power
[5173.30 → 5173.84] in our lives
[5173.84 → 5174.36] and our world.
[5174.46 → 5175.62] And in His resurrection,
[5176.36 → 5178.28] He brought into our reality
[5178.28 → 5179.44] the age to come.
[5180.38 → 5182.00] And by His Holy Spirit,
[5182.48 → 5183.46] we taste that.
[5184.54 → 5185.48] And what Paul is saying
[5185.48 → 5186.46] in Romans 6 is,
[5186.86 → 5188.00] through baptism,
[5188.36 → 5188.94] think about this,
[5188.98 → 5190.06] we move from exile
[5190.06 → 5191.20] and bondage to the powers,
[5191.64 → 5192.82] the ways of this world,
[5193.64 → 5194.64] the power of sin,
[5195.10 → 5195.96] into liberation,
[5196.64 → 5197.76] the life of the resurrection
[5197.76 → 5198.92] and power by the Spirit.
[5199.22 → 5200.24] And what Paul wants to say
[5200.24 → 5200.74] to a church
[5200.74 → 5201.52] that still thinks,
[5201.78 → 5202.64] why don't I just keep
[5202.64 → 5203.62] living the old way?
[5203.62 → 5204.08] He says,
[5204.40 → 5205.54] when you received baptism
[5205.54 → 5206.82] and you came to faith in Jesus,
[5207.18 → 5210.14] you moved into a new reality.
[5211.22 → 5212.22] And yet this church,
[5212.86 → 5213.96] that's our reality.
[5214.66 → 5215.74] The students who just profess
[5215.74 → 5216.48] faith in Jesus,
[5216.86 → 5218.34] who just share that they believe
[5218.34 → 5219.26] He's Lord and Saviour,
[5219.78 → 5220.44] they are saying,
[5220.60 → 5222.48] I now live with this church
[5222.48 → 5224.38] in the reality of the resurrection.
[5225.40 → 5226.36] That is to say,
[5226.46 → 5227.88] the Jesus who died and rose,
[5228.22 → 5231.12] His power is among us.
[5231.98 → 5233.58] His power is in this community,
[5233.72 → 5234.40] it's in our homes,
[5234.48 → 5235.26] it's in our hearts,
[5235.26 → 5238.52] and that means change is possible.
[5240.04 → 5241.76] Transformation in the deepest,
[5241.96 → 5243.36] most broken part of our lives
[5243.36 → 5244.38] is possible
[5244.38 → 5247.08] because we live in a new reality.
[5248.18 → 5249.10] And if I had more time,
[5249.16 → 5249.90] I'd share stories,
[5249.98 → 5251.02] even in our church,
[5251.52 → 5252.96] even among the students who share,
[5252.96 → 5255.04] of the way the resurrection power
[5255.04 → 5256.52] of Jesus by the Spirit
[5256.52 → 5257.62] takes hold of our lives
[5257.62 → 5259.72] and makes us new creatures,
[5260.72 → 5262.28] makes us new people
[5262.28 → 5263.84] who reflect the beauty,
[5264.00 → 5264.56] the compassion,
[5264.74 → 5265.20] the love,
[5265.26 → 5266.48] and the justice of Jesus.
[5266.84 → 5268.76] And we begin to experience now
[5268.76 → 5269.46] what's going to happen
[5269.46 → 5270.82] when Jesus returns in glory,
[5271.48 → 5272.96] when our lives are transformed perfectly
[5273.52 → 5275.20] in the way we are created
[5275.20 → 5276.20] to live from the beginning.
[5276.20 → 5278.50] And to summarize this sermon
[5278.50 → 5279.16] in a sentence,
[5279.32 → 5279.98] Paul is saying,
[5280.70 → 5283.48] you're free from sin, church.
[5284.62 → 5286.00] You've died to it.
[5286.08 → 5287.42] You've been buried with it
[5287.42 → 5288.28] through the work of Jesus.
[5288.90 → 5289.98] And now you live
[5289.98 → 5291.72] to the resurrection life of Christ.
[5292.82 → 5294.08] Become what you are.
[5294.82 → 5295.68] Discover the freedom
[5295.68 → 5296.38] you already have
[5296.38 → 5298.46] secured by the empty tomb of Christ.
[5298.86 → 5299.24] Amen?
[5299.82 → 5300.30] Amen.
[5300.78 → 5301.78] Let's pray together.
[5301.78 → 5306.10] I only get a clap
[5306.10 → 5307.04] when I do short sermons.
[5307.18 → 5308.36] It's very hurtful.
[5311.58 → 5312.84] Father, you are good.
[5314.12 → 5316.02] And we pray that we would know
[5316.02 → 5317.68] the forgiveness and the freedom
[5317.68 → 5319.18] and the resurrection power
[5319.18 → 5320.18] that Christ has given.
[5321.02 → 5322.32] We pray that you would pour out
[5322.32 → 5323.50] your Spirit on our church,
[5324.36 → 5325.72] that your Spirit would radiate
[5325.72 → 5326.50] in our homes,
[5327.00 → 5328.52] it would transform our hearts,
[5328.66 → 5330.08] and that the mission of this church
[5330.08 → 5331.76] would simply be transformed
[5331.76 → 5334.60] lives that brightly shine
[5334.60 → 5335.80] the power of Christ.
[5336.62 → 5338.22] We pray that the kingdom of God
[5338.22 → 5338.88] would be visible
[5338.88 → 5340.04] in our ordinary work
[5340.04 → 5341.92] as we become more like Jesus
[5341.92 → 5343.36] through the power of the Spirit.
[5344.56 → 5345.46] To that end, Lord,
[5345.56 → 5346.52] fill us with your Spirit.
[5347.36 → 5348.50] And may your name be known
[5348.50 → 5350.00] by this church and this city.
[5350.94 → 5351.22] Amen.
[5352.64 → 5353.54] I invite you to stand
[5353.54 → 5354.12] and sing with me
[5354.12 → 5355.10] our song of response,
[5355.92 → 5356.76] Cornerstone.
[5356.76 → 5356.84] Cornerstone.
[5361.76 → 5383.00] My hope is built on nothing less
[5383.00 → 5387.96] than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[5387.96 → 5395.80] I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
[5395.80 → 5402.34] but fully trust in Jesus' name.
[5402.34 → 5407.30] Christ alone,
[5407.30 → 5408.30] Cornerstone.
[5408.30 → 5410.30] Cornerstone.
[5410.30 → 5413.90] Weakness strong
[5413.90 → 5417.52] In the Saviour's love
[5417.52 → 5420.66] Through the storm
[5420.66 → 5423.96] He is Lord,
[5424.50 → 5426.96] Lord of all
[5426.96 → 5438.20] When darkness seems to hide His face
[5438.20 → 5444.64] We rest on His unchanging grace
[5444.64 → 5451.08] In every high and storm He gets
[5451.08 → 5457.04] Our anchor holds Him in the land
[5457.04 → 5457.62] Our anchor holds Him in the land
[5457.62 → 5462.68] Christ alone,
[5462.68 → 5465.92] Cornerstone
[5465.92 → 5468.96] Weakness strong
[5468.96 → 5472.50] In the Saviour's love
[5472.50 → 5475.64] Through the storm
[5475.64 → 5478.94] He is Lord
[5478.94 → 5482.90] Lord of all
[5482.90 → 5490.28] When Christ shall come
[5490.28 → 5493.22] With trumpet sound
[5493.22 → 5496.90] Oh, may we then
[5496.90 → 5499.26] In Him be found
[5499.26 → 5505.74] Dressed in His righteousness alone
[5505.74 → 5508.42] Footless to stand
[5508.42 → 5509.08] Footless to stand
[5509.08 → 5511.68] Before the throne
[5511.68 → 5513.10] Footless to stand
[5513.10 → 5514.42] Before the throne
[5514.42 → 5515.98] What is God
[5515.98 → 5516.54] Cornerstone
[5516.54 → 5519.60] Cornerstone
[5519.60 → 5522.60] Weakness strong
[5522.60 → 5523.54] Weakness strong
[5523.54 → 5527.00] In the Saviour's love
[5527.00 → 5529.06] Through the storm
[5529.06 → 5533.34] He is Lord
[5533.34 → 5537.30] Lord of all
[5537.30 → 5538.30] Christ alone
[5538.30 → 5540.30] Christ alone
[5540.30 → 5542.30] Christ alone
[5542.30 → 5545.30] Cornerstone
[5545.30 → 5547.30] Weakness strong
[5547.30 → 5548.30] Weakness strong
[5548.30 → 5552.30] In the Saviour's love
[5552.30 → 5554.30] Through the storm
[5554.30 → 5555.30] You are Lord
[5555.30 → 5556.30] You are Lord
[5556.30 → 5557.30] Lord
[5557.30 → 5559.70] You are Lord
[5559.70 → 5562.26] Lord of all
[5562.26 → 5566.22] Lord of all
[5566.22 → 5568.22] You are Lord
[5568.22 → 5570.22] You are Lord
[5570.22 → 5576.14] Quickly, I will be quick.
[5576.42 → 5578.92] On behalf of council, I want Dave to come on up here.
[5578.92 → 5586.42] I just want to say a few words of blessing or thankfulness to the Lord.
[5586.50 → 5593.58] Praise God that we have an opportunity to provide Dave and Brittany to go on a little sabbatical.
[5594.06 → 5599.04] The reason I say blessing is that we have Pastor Sid and Jonathan and the team.
[5599.70 → 5608.46] They're a great team that Dave has been leading and allow Dave and Brittany to go off on a sabbatical and allow them to go off well.
[5609.20 → 5611.10] So that is a huge, huge gift.
[5612.38 → 5618.14] And so, I mean, the whole purpose of this, of course, is that I look forward to the next sabbatical he gets to go on with us.
[5618.42 → 5625.12] So, yeah, I just want to say, I just want to pray with you guys as you guys go off.
[5625.92 → 5628.84] Dear Lord, thank you very much for Brittany, Dave, and the family.
[5629.50 → 5632.04] Thank you for everything they brought to this congregation.
[5632.04 → 5634.76] Know that they are loved.
[5635.72 → 5640.36] Know that they do your work here as evidenced by today.
[5640.94 → 5641.92] Thank you for them, Lord.
[5642.04 → 5645.60] Give them rest and peace and walk alongside them.
[5645.72 → 5646.62] In Jesus' name, amen.
[5646.62 → 5658.36] I just want to make some corrections.
[5658.84 → 5662.56] Number one, at the beginning of the service, Jonathan said we're having a meal to celebrate my leaving.
[5662.76 → 5663.66] That's also offensive.
[5664.10 → 5665.68] The meal is not for that.
[5666.10 → 5669.34] The meal is to celebrate the baptisms and the professions of faith.
[5669.34 → 5674.90] And if you're younger or older, just so you know, there are also tons and tons of donuts.
[5675.76 → 5679.86] So what I want you to do, stick around, help us move some of the chairs, not all of them.
[5679.92 → 5680.86] We're going to set up some tables.
[5681.26 → 5682.34] We're going to have a meal to celebrate.
[5682.50 → 5683.86] Make sure you find the students.
[5684.70 → 5688.28] Give them your words of encouragement, and let's have a meal to celebrate.
[5688.96 → 5691.50] But before we do all that, let's receive God's blessing.
[5692.72 → 5694.46] I invite you to hold out your hands to receive it.
[5694.46 → 5695.74] This comes not just from me.
[5695.74 → 5698.32] This is one of the oldest blessings we have in the Bible.
[5698.44 → 5699.64] It goes back to the book of Numbers.
[5700.70 → 5702.18] The Lord bless you and keep you.
[5703.02 → 5706.82] Lord, make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5707.36 → 5711.66] The Lord turn his face towards you and give you his peace.
[5711.80 → 5714.18] In the body of Christ, we say, amen.
[5714.18 → 5714.34] Amen.
[5725.74 → 5726.00] Amen.
[5726.00 → 5728.00] Amen.
[5756.00 → 5767.46] Turn His face toward you and give you peace.
[5771.42 → 5778.18] Lord bless you and keep you.
[5778.18 → 5785.58] Make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[5785.58 → 5797.82] Lord turn His face toward you and give you peace.
[5797.82 → 5802.36] Amen.
[5803.36 → 5805.76] Amen.
[5806.76 → 5809.26] Amen.
[5809.26 → 5823.98] Amen.
