[0.00 --> 5.66]  It is again my privilege to welcome our guest preacher for us.
[6.48 --> 10.44]  And just to share a little bit about Jim Hueving that I will introduce.
[11.18 --> 19.80]  He is a former pastor at PCC, so Pacific Community Church.
[19.96 --> 21.70]  I was losing my mind here for a bit.
[21.70 --> 24.52]  At PCC, he used to be a former pastor.
[24.52 --> 33.32]  And at this point right now, presently, he is involved and works with the organization that runs the coldest night of the year.
[33.38 --> 37.36]  That's the best way that we can make contact and know.
[38.04 --> 49.16]  And so, as most of you should know, we have won the top charity organization for coldest night of the year for, I think, a few years now.
[49.24 --> 51.74]  And so, we've been very involved.
[52.86 --> 53.34]  Yes.
[53.34 --> 53.54]  Yes.
[53.92 --> 56.10]  We praise God for your generous hearts.
[56.50 --> 60.50]  We've been very involved as we seek to bless the community.
[61.30 --> 65.46]  And when I actually first came here as an intern at Hope, Dave told me,
[65.70 --> 69.78]  Hey, John, we're, as a church, we want to be a blessing to the community.
[70.12 --> 74.96]  And one of the ways that you can learn about how we can be a blessing, practically speaking,
[75.12 --> 77.08]  I want you to go and meet Jim Hueving.
[77.28 --> 78.60]  I want you to learn from that guy.
[78.60 --> 85.76]  And so, today, it is my privilege to welcome him so that we get to learn and share what he has to witness to from God's word.
[86.16 --> 88.98]  And so, please welcome with me Pastor Jim Hueving.
[88.98 --> 92.74]  Thanks, Jonathan.
[92.74 --> 92.78]  Thanks, Jonathan.
[95.06 --> 96.90]  I still remember that visit.
[97.14 --> 98.86]  I think I still had to buy the coffee.
[99.54 --> 100.28]  Is that not true?
[101.40 --> 101.84]  No.
[101.84 --> 101.88]  No.
[102.12 --> 102.32]  Okay.
[102.32 --> 109.46]  No, I've been pastoring, have pastored in Cloverdale for many, many years, 22 years.
[109.46 --> 116.48]  And when Pacific and we were pretty engaged in starting Cloverdale Community Kitchen.
[116.74 --> 123.34]  And you guys have become such an amazing part of that, volunteering and then joining that fundraising campaign,
[123.48 --> 128.22]  coldest night of the year, and always, always being the leading church.
[128.74 --> 130.00]  You guys are amazing.
[130.00 --> 140.90]  But anyways, as I came to my conclusion at Pacific Community Church, God opened up the doors to work with this organization called Blue Sea Foundation,
[141.34 --> 152.40]  which is not a Christian organization per se, but all of us are really convicted Christians who love serving God's kingdom,
[152.70 --> 158.80]  being participants in that, and inviting the world to come alongside some awesome charities like Cloverdale Community Kitchen.
[158.80 --> 162.50]  So I get to work with 180 of them through Coldest Night of the Year,
[162.58 --> 167.48]  and now 80 other ones through a couple of other campaigns called Ride for Refuge and stuff.
[167.52 --> 170.56]  So it's a pretty exciting little venture that I'm a part of.
[170.82 --> 174.84]  And perhaps you don't know this, but I used to be a part of Hope Community Church.
[175.24 --> 177.88]  I was here probably before some of you were here.
[178.24 --> 182.18]  I was an intern about 24 years ago.
[183.16 --> 184.80]  How many people beat that?
[186.20 --> 187.60]  How many here?
[188.80 --> 189.36]  See?
[189.72 --> 190.46]  Oh, candy.
[190.62 --> 191.28]  Yeah, of course.
[191.38 --> 192.20]  Candy and Sid.
[192.76 --> 193.12]  Yeah.
[193.38 --> 193.82]  Oh, yeah.
[195.02 --> 195.38]  So, yeah.
[195.42 --> 196.36]  And then they kicked me out.
[196.62 --> 198.74]  And then I had to find my way.
[201.02 --> 202.78]  It's good to be here with you this morning.
[202.78 --> 207.24]  And I hang out in this second service.
[207.34 --> 207.86]  You know me.
[208.50 --> 212.12]  I was going to make fun of the first service people because they make us do all the work,
[212.18 --> 213.78]  like cleaning up the chairs and stuff.
[213.96 --> 216.36]  And they take all the bread, leave us with nothing.
[216.56 --> 217.40]  It's so unjust.
[218.20 --> 220.96]  I hope you got a little bit of the left remnants.
[220.96 --> 228.16]  Today I want to talk about the big theme of justice in the Bible.
[228.36 --> 229.20]  It's a passion of mine.
[230.88 --> 238.02]  Sort of the thing I think about quite a bit and wrestle with, seeking to come to terms with,
[238.02 --> 244.62]  in terms of the way I've done ministry, the way I'm engaging in the years yet to come.
[246.14 --> 251.28]  And I want to just talk about justice and how big a deal it is in the Bible.
[251.28 --> 254.28]  And maybe turn the pot.
[255.96 --> 257.96]  You know, I'm not a member of you here yet.
[258.58 --> 261.20]  This may just define whether I ever make it in.
[262.62 --> 263.44]  Who knows?
[266.06 --> 272.66]  This picture is painted on a Jerusalem wall, or it once was, 2003, by a guy named Bansky.
[273.30 --> 273.96]  We think it's a guy.
[274.04 --> 275.28]  We're not sure who it is, really.
[276.74 --> 279.36]  It's a Palestinian, enraged.
[279.36 --> 281.60]  We've seen pictures like this.
[284.28 --> 286.68]  Standing up against what is unjust.
[288.24 --> 294.18]  But yet, the pictures, of course, feel the tension because it's not a rock in his hand, but flowers.
[297.04 --> 299.00]  Artists perhaps saying something like,
[299.88 --> 302.34]  yeah, there's issues of rage and anger in this world.
[303.56 --> 304.76]  But man, rocks.
[306.16 --> 307.66]  Maybe not the way to deal with it.
[307.66 --> 309.68]  Maybe we need more flowers.
[311.98 --> 315.24]  Captures a little bit about the need for justice in our world.
[316.12 --> 326.36]  And also, the reality about how the church may be a participant in that reality in terms of calling out for justice.
[326.36 --> 328.48]  There's another picture.
[328.48 --> 332.92]  There's a story in Nova Scotia that I came across a couple of years ago.
[333.12 --> 334.28]  A wonderful story.
[334.72 --> 338.98]  Kelly McCann here is a carpenter that lives in Mill Bay.
[339.36 --> 339.90]  Is it Mill Bay?
[340.30 --> 341.70]  Anyway, Mill Cove, Nova Scotia.
[341.70 --> 343.70]  He's a carpenter.
[343.70 --> 346.52]  He one day was walking down the street of his neighborhood.
[347.52 --> 354.50]  And he noticed that Jane's house, an education assistant teacher at the local school,
[354.90 --> 357.74]  her patio on the front of the house was askew.
[357.86 --> 359.72]  It was falling off her house.
[359.72 --> 363.28]  And he's like, this is not good.
[364.14 --> 365.34]  Maybe I can do something.
[365.44 --> 366.90]  So he knocks on her door.
[367.76 --> 370.50]  He knocks on her door and she opens up and invites him in.
[371.02 --> 377.40]  And then he realizes it's not just the porch, but the floorboards are sinking and rotting.
[377.78 --> 383.78]  The toilet that he saw just around the corner was being propped up because it was falling through the floor.
[383.78 --> 387.62]  There was things just, it was just not, the whole house was compromised.
[389.04 --> 390.44]  And he's like, this is beyond me.
[391.82 --> 393.60]  And so he phoned up a few friends.
[394.72 --> 399.46]  They said, hey, Jane, she's like, she needs some help.
[399.70 --> 400.36]  Could you help me?
[401.14 --> 402.36]  Can we do some work together?
[402.76 --> 403.56]  Next picture.
[403.84 --> 408.46]  Well, as a result, the whole community started getting onto this project.
[408.88 --> 413.26]  Social media went abuzz and hardware stores got involved.
[413.26 --> 422.92]  And all of a sudden, they rebuilt this shack, this ramshackle shack, into a functional operating home for Jane to live in.
[424.36 --> 426.18]  I love that story.
[426.24 --> 429.32]  I love it because he saw something.
[429.64 --> 430.44]  He was moved by it.
[430.44 --> 434.16]  As he said, you know, I live my whole life taking care of my own needs.
[434.16 --> 444.56]  But maybe sometimes we just have to stop and look at the needs around us and see the kind of people who are falling in the cracks.
[444.56 --> 446.96]  And he responded.
[448.18 --> 449.42]  And she welcomed.
[450.20 --> 451.86]  And the community rallied.
[452.74 --> 455.08]  To me, I don't know if you love this story.
[455.22 --> 456.66]  This is the first time you maybe heard it.
[456.66 --> 464.84]  But I love this story because it paints a beautiful picture of what I think how God sees justice lived out in this world.
[465.76 --> 477.60]  Where people see an issue, an injustice, something that's just not the way it should be, and be able to do something about it.
[477.60 --> 482.52]  And that's why I love that story.
[483.56 --> 489.80]  Because it illustrates so much of what God is up to in this world, making all things new.
[489.80 --> 493.70]  Now, I wonder.
[496.22 --> 496.98]  I wonder.
[499.76 --> 504.96]  You know, often I sit in churches, and I wonder.
[506.60 --> 510.00]  Are we really thinking about justice?
[511.66 --> 514.50]  Are we really content?
[514.50 --> 522.24]  Are we the kind of people that will step out like a Kelly to help a Jane?
[524.72 --> 530.88]  Are we the kind of people who will see a patio askew and knock on the door?
[534.02 --> 540.86]  We're going to take a look at the book of Amos, or the prophet Amos, just for a moment.
[540.86 --> 547.36]  Because he wants to highlight this notion that God is up to doing justice in this world.
[548.06 --> 551.58]  And he's calling his people to be justice keepers.
[552.94 --> 554.88]  Let's just look at Amos for a moment.
[555.24 --> 560.60]  You know, Amos lived in the divided southern nation of Israel.
[561.06 --> 566.46]  Divided from its ten other, you know, brothers and sisters up to the north, northern Israel.
[566.46 --> 572.38]  And he was a little bit miffed as he was watching things go down in northern Israel.
[573.34 --> 577.46]  He was miffed by the reality of their religious hypocrisy.
[578.10 --> 579.66]  They had become a powerful nation.
[580.22 --> 581.78]  They had expanded their territory.
[582.22 --> 586.76]  And they were adding wealth to all that they had, especially amongst the privileged,
[587.12 --> 590.22]  while the less privileged among them suffered great neglect.
[591.00 --> 592.74]  And he was just miffed by that.
[592.74 --> 601.58]  He was like, you are called by God to create a just society, to do good amongst each other.
[602.14 --> 603.52]  But you are messing things up.
[603.62 --> 609.54]  And so, in chapter 5, he says a few very, he just calls it out.
[609.74 --> 613.92]  He goes, there are those of you who are turning justice into bitterness.
[614.06 --> 617.92]  You're taking a good thing, and you're making it taste really bad.
[617.92 --> 621.96]  A good thing, like a good cinnamon donut.
[624.52 --> 629.16]  You know, it tastes like a stale, moldy piece of bread.
[629.64 --> 630.50]  It's just awful.
[632.58 --> 638.04]  You're turning justice into bitterness, and you're casting righteousness to the ground.
[638.04 --> 645.30]  There are those of you who hate the one who upholds justice.
[645.58 --> 648.70]  The one who says, hey, hey, hey, just a minute here, just a minute here, we've got to do it right.
[650.74 --> 655.28]  And you detest the one who comes up and says, this is the way it should be.
[656.40 --> 657.60]  In fact, you ignore them.
[657.60 --> 662.08]  There are those of you who oppress the innocent.
[662.30 --> 670.28]  People who are suffering, who are not doing wrong, and you take bribes and deprive the poor of their justice in the courts.
[672.74 --> 679.98]  You powerful, capable people are making a mess of what it means to be God's people.
[681.98 --> 687.10]  You have turned justice into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness.
[687.60 --> 690.38]  Not a good scene.
[691.26 --> 698.68]  In fact, in verses 21 to 24, he sort of says this big statement, voicing the words of God.
[699.52 --> 704.34]  I hate, I despise your religious festivals.
[704.50 --> 706.54]  I just can't stand them.
[708.44 --> 711.34]  Your assemblies are a stink to me.
[711.34 --> 723.04]  You might have the perfume, and you might put on the aftershave, and it all might look sort of cool, but it turns my stomach, says God.
[724.24 --> 729.34]  Even though you bring me these burnt offerings and grain offerings, I'm not going to take it.
[729.84 --> 730.52]  I don't want it.
[731.40 --> 736.76]  And though you bring choice fellowship offerings, I have no regard for it.
[736.76 --> 748.76]  I will not listen to the music of your harps.
[748.76 --> 758.08]  Instead, please, oh my goodness, could you let justice roll on like a river?
[759.52 --> 762.00]  Righteousness like a never-failing stream.
[762.16 --> 764.38]  Oh, if you could just turn this around.
[764.38 --> 776.98]  And may justice and righteousness roll out like a never-ending stream of goodness, transforming the world that you are living in.
[777.58 --> 778.94]  That's what I want.
[780.66 --> 786.08]  You know, one of the things he's saying, which is maybe something we need to really take to ourselves.
[786.08 --> 788.70]  One big takeaway is this.
[789.52 --> 797.34]  Pious worship becomes false worship when it ignores injustice.
[802.30 --> 808.50]  Pious worship becomes false worship when it ignores injustice.
[810.96 --> 811.90]  That's loaded.
[811.90 --> 819.28]  We can make our worship profoundly amazing.
[820.72 --> 836.86]  But if it doesn't motivate us with sustained wash of justice-keeping as we go out the doors and into our communities,
[837.24 --> 839.68]  this worship becomes false.
[841.90 --> 848.86]  Prophets get to say things hard like that.
[851.12 --> 854.60]  And I think we do need to listen to this kind of stuff.
[854.60 --> 858.18]  And Amos, he uses these two words, mishvat and cicada.
[859.04 --> 861.98]  And the combination is pretty cool.
[861.98 --> 867.70]  But, you know, mishvat is this action-oriented, do-good type of approach.
[868.12 --> 869.36]  You do justice.
[869.84 --> 875.70]  And cicada is sort of this description of making sure all your social relationships are good.
[875.76 --> 879.16]  You know, so often we think of justice in terms of retribution, right?
[879.24 --> 881.20]  It's like you do wrong, you should pay.
[881.32 --> 883.20]  You speed, you should pay.
[883.50 --> 884.04]  You know what?
[884.04 --> 887.60]  You live out the consequences of what you're doing wrong.
[887.82 --> 888.78]  Retributive justice.
[889.42 --> 900.22]  But that's just a part of the perspective of all that God has who wants to see all relationships thrive in the world that God has created.
[900.22 --> 910.38]  Our relationships to each other, our relationships to different kinds of people, our relationship to God, our relationship to ourselves, our relationship to creation.
[910.74 --> 915.84]  God sees justice as what we call it shalom in the Bible.
[915.84 --> 918.26]  We use the word peace.
[918.44 --> 922.26]  But it's just everything is in its place and it's thriving and growing.
[923.14 --> 924.40]  That's what God calls us.
[924.64 --> 931.90]  And, of course, we understand sort of this retribution thing, too, because we know that we as people have broken relationship with God.
[932.06 --> 937.46]  And there's no way, you know, no way that we can overcome this brokenness with God.
[937.56 --> 941.06]  And so we're so thankful that Jesus Christ comes in and says,
[941.62 --> 943.54]  For you, I have died.
[943.88 --> 945.42]  For you, I have paid the penalty.
[945.42 --> 949.84]  Come, come and enjoy this great feast of love and mercy.
[950.30 --> 951.20]  You're mine.
[951.30 --> 952.00]  I'm yours.
[952.24 --> 953.18]  And let's live.
[953.42 --> 955.72]  And let's do the same for so many others.
[955.88 --> 960.78]  Let's build a community where people can all thrive together.
[962.10 --> 966.72]  In fact, you know, Amos sort of says this very much in chapter 5.
[967.02 --> 968.58]  In one place, verse 4, he says,
[968.94 --> 969.76]  Seek the Lord and live.
[970.10 --> 970.60]  Seek Him.
[971.20 --> 975.34]  If you seek the Lord, if you grab hold of Him, you'll live.
[975.82 --> 976.34]  You'll live.
[976.80 --> 982.84]  You'll be shown how to live and put life together in a way that's redemptive and powerful and restorative.
[983.34 --> 986.62]  But then in verse 14, he says the same thing, but different words sort of.
[986.96 --> 992.36]  He says, seek good, not evil, that you may live.
[992.36 --> 994.38]  It's almost the same thing.
[994.50 --> 996.10]  By seeking God, you're seeking good.
[996.32 --> 997.80]  By seeking good, you're seeking God.
[998.84 --> 999.62]  And you're living.
[1000.42 --> 1001.44]  It goes into one and the same.
[1001.52 --> 1003.28]  You can't seek God and not seek good.
[1004.38 --> 1006.20]  I mean, that's sort of goofy.
[1009.26 --> 1009.62]  Right?
[1009.62 --> 1018.06]  Now, at this point, at this point, you're probably thinking to yourself, oh my goodness, do I have to listen to a pastor?
[1018.54 --> 1019.54]  Well, I'm not really a pastor.
[1019.60 --> 1020.68]  I don't have a license anymore.
[1020.76 --> 1022.42]  But anyways, that's another story.
[1022.42 --> 1030.82]  But do I have to listen to some guy who's trying to talk to me about social justice?
[1032.72 --> 1034.40]  Social justice, what's that?
[1035.16 --> 1036.44]  That's too complicated.
[1036.56 --> 1039.02]  And I'm not sure if that's really the Christian thing to do.
[1039.02 --> 1044.44]  In fact, you know, as I was sort of scanning the internet, I came across a couple sermon titles that said,
[1044.86 --> 1048.46]  Biblical justice and social justice, the differences in why it matters.
[1049.66 --> 1052.00]  Social justice, its implications in why it's wrong.
[1052.42 --> 1053.04]  I'm like, what?
[1053.20 --> 1055.04]  Well, I'm not going to listen to that sermon.
[1055.46 --> 1056.24]  Well, what's with that?
[1058.26 --> 1059.68]  I mean, think about it.
[1060.32 --> 1063.60]  What justice is not social?
[1063.60 --> 1068.98]  All justice is social.
[1071.80 --> 1074.44]  It's about right living in this world.
[1075.90 --> 1079.32]  Now, it doesn't mean I have to agree with every social justice champion.
[1079.48 --> 1089.10]  No, no, I can wrestle with them and think through them and offer up maybe a Christian worldview perspective on this from the Bible and say,
[1089.10 --> 1096.70]  I think, you know, and why would I give up this term social justice when it's been so informed by a biblical imagination?
[1097.46 --> 1099.08]  Thank you, Martin Luther, Jr.
[1104.88 --> 1107.20]  Now, some of you might say, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1107.58 --> 1109.62]  Jim, you're just so passionate, you know.
[1109.68 --> 1113.12]  I can see you getting sort of effervescent about it and all that kind of stuff.
[1113.26 --> 1117.46]  Well, let's just walk through the Bible really quickly and just sort of capture this theme.
[1117.46 --> 1120.16]  You know, this picture, you know this picture, right?
[1123.02 --> 1124.20]  I'm just testing you now.
[1124.94 --> 1125.88]  I'm testing you.
[1127.18 --> 1130.40]  What did anybody know what this means?
[1131.08 --> 1131.66]  You do, right?
[1132.14 --> 1133.76]  You're all gone to surge, right?
[1134.08 --> 1139.46]  I'm going to just tell you, you know, creation, rebellion, you know, people have promised Jesus Christ comes,
[1139.80 --> 1143.50]  the church, and, you know, restoration, the full restoration of things.
[1143.78 --> 1146.26]  You're going to see justice played out here all the way through.
[1146.26 --> 1148.42]  And I'm going to stop right in the middle for a little bit.
[1149.54 --> 1153.36]  But when you think about it, when God created the world, all things were just.
[1154.00 --> 1155.82]  Just the way it should be.
[1157.34 --> 1162.56]  With a built-in momentum of going beyond.
[1163.26 --> 1164.24]  And that's humanity.
[1164.64 --> 1171.48]  And God called Adam and Eve and all of us to sort of steward this amazing reality where life will expand.
[1171.48 --> 1174.28]  I mean, there was four rivers coming out of the Garden of Eden.
[1174.34 --> 1178.08]  It just meant that there was a highway to a whole other pieces of the planet.
[1179.14 --> 1181.00]  And just culture could develop.
[1181.64 --> 1183.42]  God made it good.
[1184.36 --> 1188.42]  And it was just, it was just the way God designed it for us.
[1188.88 --> 1190.80]  But of course, a tragic turn happened.
[1191.34 --> 1193.64]  Adam and Eve caught up in a lie.
[1193.76 --> 1195.14]  Thought, nah, there's a better way.
[1195.14 --> 1197.28]  Well, anyway, you know what happened.
[1198.14 --> 1198.90]  Apple eaten.
[1199.28 --> 1200.12]  Things fall apart.
[1200.66 --> 1204.36]  And there's just this rupturing of relationship between them and God.
[1205.50 --> 1206.60]  Them and each other.
[1208.56 --> 1209.94]  Them and themselves.
[1210.94 --> 1215.44]  These expectant, optimistic reality has now turned into shame and fear.
[1215.54 --> 1216.20]  And they're hiding.
[1216.36 --> 1217.62]  It's like, this is goofy.
[1217.62 --> 1224.02]  And then all of a sudden, now there's this story of, the creation is now sort of tripping over itself with you.
[1224.12 --> 1225.62]  Because now there's thorns and thorns.
[1225.70 --> 1230.64]  It's just now a broken reality where things are not just the way they should be.
[1230.98 --> 1234.52]  And it just gets on worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[1238.70 --> 1240.30]  But then God perseveres.
[1240.30 --> 1246.36]  And he doesn't want to give up in this creation and his humanity.
[1247.18 --> 1250.02]  And he births out a new reality.
[1250.82 --> 1251.44]  And amazing.
[1252.58 --> 1254.08]  He births it out through Abraham.
[1254.68 --> 1259.50]  Who then, his family gets caught up under slavery in Egypt.
[1261.96 --> 1263.72]  And God redeems them.
[1264.24 --> 1265.50]  And this is an iconic.
[1265.88 --> 1269.54]  This is the redemptive story of the Old Testament.
[1269.54 --> 1270.74]  How God comes in.
[1271.14 --> 1274.50]  And for a people that are unjustly treated.
[1275.46 --> 1278.16]  He redeems them by his might and his stronghold.
[1278.36 --> 1279.66]  This is what God is about.
[1279.84 --> 1282.12]  It's about transforming communities.
[1282.30 --> 1284.62]  And then he had this grand purpose for Israel.
[1284.96 --> 1286.56]  He says, I've saved you.
[1286.76 --> 1290.62]  Now you be the people who I'm going to shine a light to the whole world.
[1290.94 --> 1293.08]  And you're going to live in a new way.
[1293.16 --> 1294.30]  I'm going to show you how.
[1294.52 --> 1295.96]  I'm going to lead you to this.
[1296.12 --> 1298.42]  And you're going to be a people that instead of oppression,
[1298.42 --> 1299.62]  you're going to be a blessing.
[1300.50 --> 1301.86]  This is what you're going to be.
[1302.10 --> 1303.92]  Instead of grabbing, you're going to be giving.
[1304.08 --> 1305.82]  Instead of ignoring, you're going to be helping.
[1305.98 --> 1307.74]  Instead of excluding, you're going to be welcoming.
[1308.16 --> 1310.10]  Instead of ignoring, you're going to be listening.
[1310.50 --> 1314.26]  You are going to be the people who I am going to work through
[1314.26 --> 1316.42]  to be a light into this dark world.
[1316.42 --> 1320.68]  And people and the nations are going to look at you and say,
[1321.04 --> 1325.90]  wow, you guys, this is better than what I got.
[1326.06 --> 1327.58]  I want what you got.
[1328.16 --> 1329.08]  Can I come?
[1329.88 --> 1335.04]  And I mean, that's what God wanted to do with Israel.
[1337.30 --> 1339.96]  People who were treated unjustly to become people
[1339.96 --> 1341.92]  who would treat the rest of the world justly and say,
[1342.24 --> 1343.52]  see, there's a better way.
[1343.52 --> 1345.04]  Let's go do this together.
[1345.30 --> 1346.76]  You're all part of this.
[1347.00 --> 1348.32]  All nations can come.
[1351.38 --> 1354.06]  Well, Israel had its moments, didn't it?
[1354.24 --> 1355.36]  Some glorious moments.
[1356.18 --> 1360.14]  The man, the accumulated consequence was pretty embarrassing
[1360.14 --> 1361.50]  for the people of Israel.
[1362.44 --> 1363.80]  And a good lesson for all of us.
[1365.50 --> 1368.90]  And things just got worse to worse for them.
[1368.90 --> 1372.06]  They got polluted by the world
[1372.06 --> 1377.30]  and undermined the very promise that God put upon them.
[1378.72 --> 1380.36]  But then, God doesn't give up.
[1380.74 --> 1384.44]  God amps it up by sending his one and only.
[1385.44 --> 1386.52]  Jesus Christ.
[1387.28 --> 1388.02]  His one and only.
[1388.12 --> 1390.82]  He says, the one who was before all time
[1390.82 --> 1394.40]  comes and assumes mortal flesh, us,
[1394.74 --> 1395.88]  and becomes one of us,
[1396.20 --> 1400.20]  bears the injustice of the world in his own body,
[1400.50 --> 1403.92]  and shows us a whole new way.
[1403.92 --> 1409.82]  And as such, the gospel,
[1411.30 --> 1412.98]  call, you know,
[1413.24 --> 1416.88]  the gospel just demonstrates that we too are a people
[1416.88 --> 1419.90]  like the Hebrews who were caught under slavery,
[1420.04 --> 1422.14]  so too we that Jesus came into that,
[1422.40 --> 1423.24]  into the dust of it.
[1424.20 --> 1427.18]  And Jesus came to just turn the tables upside down
[1427.18 --> 1428.68]  in a revolutionary way.
[1429.50 --> 1430.52]  I mean, Jesus knew this.
[1430.60 --> 1432.10]  You know his first sermon, right?
[1432.10 --> 1433.32]  The first sermon.
[1433.48 --> 1434.40]  What was that sermon?
[1434.56 --> 1435.84]  What passage was it?
[1437.36 --> 1438.80]  Isaiah, I think it's 61.
[1440.16 --> 1442.46]  You know, when Jesus declares what his mission is,
[1442.74 --> 1445.04]  he goes, the spirit of the Lord is on me.
[1445.54 --> 1446.32]  The spirit of the Lord.
[1446.42 --> 1450.56]  He is the first spirit-filled human being in the world.
[1452.04 --> 1453.88]  You want to know what a spirit-filled life looks like?
[1454.02 --> 1455.02]  Take a look at Jesus,
[1455.08 --> 1458.10]  because that's what it means for human and God
[1458.10 --> 1459.58]  to be coexisting together.
[1459.58 --> 1462.26]  And he invites us into that spirit life.
[1462.48 --> 1463.66]  But anyways, that's another point.
[1464.00 --> 1465.68]  But Jesus says,
[1466.64 --> 1469.90]  the spirit of the Lord is on me
[1469.90 --> 1473.04]  because he has anointed me to proclaim good news.
[1473.38 --> 1474.14]  To who?
[1475.22 --> 1475.96]  The poor.
[1477.86 --> 1479.02]  Freedom to prisoners.
[1479.18 --> 1479.92]  Sight for the blind.
[1480.08 --> 1480.94]  Freedom for the oppressed.
[1481.34 --> 1482.52]  The Lord's favor has come.
[1482.58 --> 1483.14]  It's come.
[1483.14 --> 1486.70]  Jesus knew it.
[1487.12 --> 1488.38]  His mother knew it, too.
[1488.92 --> 1490.48]  Mothers are always right.
[1491.20 --> 1493.04]  Mothers are always right.
[1493.56 --> 1495.46]  And this next picture here, I love this.
[1495.54 --> 1499.12]  This is my hopeful Christmas card one year,
[1499.26 --> 1500.86]  if I can get permission from the family.
[1501.72 --> 1503.06]  But, you know, we think of Mary,
[1503.42 --> 1505.70]  the mother of Jesus, as some meek and mild one.
[1505.70 --> 1508.30]  But if you read her lullaby,
[1509.22 --> 1512.04]  it ain't so meek and mild.
[1512.18 --> 1517.60]  It's like, oh, my son, the divine one,
[1517.90 --> 1520.86]  is going to turn things upside down.
[1521.38 --> 1524.04]  It's going to take my reality and transform it.
[1525.22 --> 1526.88]  And I love this picture.
[1527.02 --> 1529.30]  It's Mary, fist up high,
[1529.46 --> 1532.18]  clenched with her head on a skeleton's head.
[1532.44 --> 1534.30]  And it's like death is going to be done.
[1534.30 --> 1535.88]  The snake is underneath that.
[1536.14 --> 1538.74]  It's like this is going to be conquered.
[1539.92 --> 1541.62]  Isn't this a great Christmas card?
[1542.40 --> 1545.16]  Don't you think this is what you should be sending out?
[1545.90 --> 1547.32]  I love it.
[1548.16 --> 1550.02]  In fact, I got it on a poster on my wall,
[1550.14 --> 1551.54]  but my kids were a little bit embarrassed.
[1551.66 --> 1552.20]  I took it down.
[1553.16 --> 1553.50]  I don't know.
[1554.02 --> 1557.54]  But anyways, mothers are never wrong.
[1559.24 --> 1561.04]  And Jesus, think about the Beatitudes.
[1562.60 --> 1563.08]  You know what?
[1563.08 --> 1565.12]  Every time we get to the Beatitudes,
[1565.20 --> 1565.92]  I think they're good.
[1567.74 --> 1570.70]  But sometimes I struggle trying to absorb it.
[1571.36 --> 1572.98]  What does it mean to mourn?
[1573.68 --> 1575.08]  What does it mean to...
[1576.20 --> 1579.90]  How do I spiritualize this and apply it to my life?
[1581.54 --> 1583.50]  You know why I think we struggle with that?
[1583.60 --> 1585.02]  Maybe it's just me.
[1585.02 --> 1590.70]  I think our life is so contemporary, modern, Canadiana,
[1591.00 --> 1593.22]  where life is pretty good.
[1594.42 --> 1599.92]  We don't resonate to the reality that these Beatitudes speak to.
[1599.92 --> 1601.44]  What do they speak to?
[1601.62 --> 1603.36]  People who are suffering and under oppression.
[1605.40 --> 1610.86]  People who really cry because they can't overcome the reality of their economic oppression.
[1610.86 --> 1621.36]  They mourn the reality that they're of a certain sort of person that's just not accepted in the broader realities.
[1622.56 --> 1623.32]  They suffer.
[1623.32 --> 1627.50]  In fact, if you take the Beatitudes,
[1628.72 --> 1631.34]  it's sort of fun in the Second Service because I don't have to worry about time.
[1631.86 --> 1633.20]  But you can chase me if you need to.
[1634.30 --> 1636.16]  But anyways, think of these Beatitudes.
[1636.16 --> 1640.16]  When we read the Beatitudes, there's this word called diaksonae,
[1641.06 --> 1644.50]  which is translated justice regularly.
[1646.22 --> 1653.66]  But our English translators tend to use the word righteousness to distinguish some of the nuance.
[1654.64 --> 1655.86]  And they have the reasons.
[1655.98 --> 1657.06]  And I'm not going to argue with them.
[1657.12 --> 1658.36]  I'm not smart enough for that.
[1658.66 --> 1660.70]  But I do like Nicholas Wolterstorff who says,
[1660.82 --> 1664.12]  maybe we should really alter the conversation around here.
[1664.12 --> 1667.04]  I mean, in the Spanish Bible, they don't have a word for righteousness.
[1667.38 --> 1668.52]  It's just justice.
[1668.62 --> 1671.50]  So if you're Spanish and you've got a Spanish translation in front of you
[1671.50 --> 1673.82]  and you look at these verses, it says justicia.
[1674.90 --> 1676.00]  The word justice.
[1677.18 --> 1678.40]  And so really, I'll go back.
[1678.94 --> 1680.30]  Blessed, it says.
[1680.60 --> 1683.48]  Blessed are those who are in hunger for righteousness.
[1684.20 --> 1686.74]  Really is justice.
[1687.00 --> 1687.82]  It's the same word.
[1689.14 --> 1691.62]  And then 5 verse 10, it's the same thing.
[1691.88 --> 1692.30]  Same word.
[1692.30 --> 1694.90]  Blessed are those who are persecuted because of justice.
[1695.50 --> 1696.68]  For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[1697.42 --> 1700.70]  Why do I think justice is a better word, even if you love the word righteousness?
[1701.82 --> 1705.54]  I think righteousness has become sort of an introverted sense of,
[1706.10 --> 1708.50]  oh, how's my relationship with God?
[1709.48 --> 1712.50]  Righteousness is more about, am I right with God?
[1712.56 --> 1713.22]  Am I doing good?
[1713.26 --> 1713.84]  Am I growing?
[1714.66 --> 1715.62]  It's more personal.
[1715.96 --> 1717.88]  We've individuated that word.
[1717.88 --> 1722.98]  And it's sort of a nice churchy word, but I mean, most people don't use the word out there.
[1724.14 --> 1724.40]  Right?
[1726.98 --> 1733.12]  But when you read it, and you replace it with justice, it does it a little bit of a moment.
[1733.26 --> 1734.58]  I mean, think about it.
[1735.88 --> 1739.74]  Did Jesus, I mean, righteousness is this sort of be nice person, right?
[1739.80 --> 1740.72]  Yeah, a morally nice person.
[1740.72 --> 1744.64]  But was Jesus crucified because he was nice?
[1747.68 --> 1753.54]  Did Jesus get thrown onto the cross because, you know, he was just good?
[1753.54 --> 1753.94]  No.
[1754.60 --> 1754.96]  No.
[1755.88 --> 1760.02]  Jesus was crucified because he confronted the injustice in his world.
[1760.98 --> 1766.06]  He, in fact, was turning the tables on their economic realities or their religious systems
[1766.06 --> 1768.90]  and saying, you guys, this is wrong.
[1769.72 --> 1772.82]  What you think is good is really undermining people's lives.
[1773.44 --> 1774.64]  This is not healthy.
[1774.96 --> 1776.68]  This is not the way God wants it.
[1776.84 --> 1779.54]  And I'm in your face about it.
[1779.54 --> 1787.52]  Jesus was, I mean, you read Matthew and you, you know, he says some nasty things to the religious leaders.
[1788.64 --> 1789.32]  Nasty things.
[1789.60 --> 1791.16]  You guys are whitewashed hoops.
[1791.32 --> 1792.74]  I'm sure that went over well.
[1796.26 --> 1797.98]  I don't know.
[1798.10 --> 1803.56]  Jesus is a nice guy, but he's also a pretty strong person that goes past the line, isn't he?
[1805.88 --> 1807.52]  So when we say, what would Jesus do?
[1808.12 --> 1808.96]  Would you do that?
[1809.54 --> 1816.82]  And, of course, Jesus calls the church to it.
[1817.62 --> 1822.36]  And, of course, the book of Revelation describes how all things will be made new, which is amazing.
[1823.34 --> 1827.26]  You'll find justice all the way through the New Testament, all the way right to the finish.
[1827.40 --> 1829.82]  In fact, Nicholas Wolterstorff puts it this way.
[1830.26 --> 1835.90]  He says, Israel's religion was a religion of salvation, not of contemplation.
[1836.32 --> 1837.44]  Don't go too far on that one.
[1837.44 --> 1841.56]  But it was a religion of action.
[1842.36 --> 1847.72]  That is what accounts for the mantra of widows, the orphans, the aliens, and the poor.
[1848.24 --> 1853.58]  It's not a religion of salvation from this earthly existence.
[1853.86 --> 1854.14]  It's not.
[1854.14 --> 1857.44]  Christ is not calling us to endure this.
[1858.28 --> 1859.36]  Hopefully we make it.
[1859.80 --> 1862.78]  I can't wait till he takes me up to heaven so I'm finished with this.
[1863.32 --> 1863.62]  No, no.
[1863.72 --> 1864.92]  That's not what he calls us to.
[1865.16 --> 1871.58]  In fact, what he calls us to is a religion of salvation from injustice in this earthly existence.
[1871.58 --> 1882.22]  Jesus is calling us to participate with him, to make things new, and to demonstrate that reality of a coming kingdom when all of it will be done by his strength and his power.
[1882.22 --> 1885.92]  And James agrees.
[1888.00 --> 1890.78]  Religion that our father accepts is pure and faultless is this.
[1891.28 --> 1892.24]  To look after who?
[1892.42 --> 1894.20]  The orphans and the widows in their distress.
[1895.08 --> 1897.12]  And, oh, I lost my page.
[1897.36 --> 1899.94]  And to keep oneself being polluted by the world.
[1900.56 --> 1900.88]  Right?
[1900.88 --> 1903.60]  I love that word, pollution.
[1904.24 --> 1905.32]  I think it's so descriptive.
[1906.92 --> 1907.36]  Pollution.
[1907.56 --> 1912.32]  It's that foreign, toxic substance that makes what is good stink.
[1912.84 --> 1914.96]  And that's what humans have done to God's creation.
[1915.62 --> 1916.62]  Made it stink.
[1917.38 --> 1918.16]  It's ugly.
[1918.78 --> 1919.62]  It's foul.
[1920.50 --> 1921.54]  It's not hospitable.
[1923.42 --> 1924.52]  And James is saying,
[1925.52 --> 1928.52]  don't be polluted by it.
[1928.52 --> 1930.84]  Don't even walk past it.
[1930.92 --> 1931.96]  Do something about it.
[1933.08 --> 1937.36]  Because if you don't deal with the stink through the power of the gospel,
[1938.04 --> 1939.80]  you're going to stink too.
[1940.62 --> 1943.76]  It's going to undermine what it means to be God's followers today.
[1950.06 --> 1953.36]  Do as Kelly did when he saw James Crooked Porch.
[1954.00 --> 1956.98]  And he knocked on the door and rallied the whole community.
[1958.52 --> 1958.88]  Okay.
[1959.36 --> 1959.80]  Okay.
[1960.26 --> 1961.76]  I'm going to finish up with three points.
[1963.18 --> 1964.50]  What do we do with this?
[1965.46 --> 1967.74]  How can we become more just?
[1969.08 --> 1971.56]  And live out this calling of justice?
[1972.68 --> 1973.74]  Well, a lot more can be said.
[1973.90 --> 1975.22]  But at least this can be said.
[1976.10 --> 1980.86]  To become part of a community that seeks justice.
[1980.86 --> 1988.32]  Churches need to be places of justice.
[1990.32 --> 1993.48]  People who walk around in their life and they can smell the stink.
[1993.48 --> 1999.16]  And not like, you know, in the Samaritan, the good Samaritan story, walk by.
[2000.30 --> 2001.46]  But do something.
[2003.36 --> 2008.26]  And knowing that it will overwhelm, you invite the community to participate with.
[2008.44 --> 2010.90]  You be part of a community that is sensitive.
[2011.16 --> 2012.80]  Has a nose for stink.
[2013.14 --> 2016.22]  Is able to say, we've got to do something about this.
[2016.22 --> 2019.96]  We can lead the community.
[2020.06 --> 2021.64]  It doesn't mean we have to solve all the problems.
[2021.74 --> 2025.16]  We've got God and spirit and all this good resource.
[2025.26 --> 2026.22]  We also have the community.
[2026.34 --> 2028.58]  We can invite the community to help us do this.
[2028.86 --> 2031.70]  Because you're calling out to them to say, hey, there's a better way.
[2031.94 --> 2032.88]  Can we do this together?
[2033.06 --> 2035.06]  This is what it means to be kingdom kind of people.
[2035.16 --> 2038.98]  Inviting people into the thrust of rolling justice.
[2038.98 --> 2047.86]  In fact, you know, one of the things my family loves about this place is the diversity of nations that gather here.
[2048.82 --> 2049.64]  It's so cool.
[2050.38 --> 2051.04]  Such a blessing.
[2053.84 --> 2055.62]  But here's one thing I'll challenge you on.
[2056.66 --> 2058.14]  I've been here for about a year and a half.
[2059.64 --> 2064.00]  And I have yet to hear a concern about indigenous people in Canada raised.
[2064.00 --> 2072.20]  I'm not even sure if we're ready to acknowledge that we're on their unseated land.
[2073.74 --> 2079.90]  I'm not even sure if we're really willing to listen to the kind of pain and suffering that they have endured.
[2081.24 --> 2085.48]  And us privileged have, I'm not going to say taken advantage of.
[2086.48 --> 2089.40]  But we live on the assumption of such things.
[2089.40 --> 2094.80]  My good friend Ray Aldred, a Christian theologian at a Vancouver School of Theology.
[2099.50 --> 2109.14]  He says, churches need to understand that the indigenous community in Canada perhaps are articulating the gospel in a more profound way than the churches.
[2109.68 --> 2110.60]  And I go, why is that?
[2110.72 --> 2112.54]  I said, because they suffer.
[2112.54 --> 2121.12]  And they've had to grab a hold of a gospel out of that suffering and out of the oppression.
[2122.72 --> 2126.74]  We would be better if we would listen and hear.
[2127.16 --> 2128.86]  I don't, maybe you can't agree with them.
[2129.06 --> 2138.66]  But my goodness, can we not, we live on the lands and the, we, people God has worked with for generations and generations.
[2139.08 --> 2139.94]  They were ready for us.
[2139.94 --> 2140.90]  They had dreams of us.
[2142.54 --> 2144.74]  They became Christians before the treaties were set.
[2147.26 --> 2151.42]  And then we abandoned them to their suffering and live on their land.
[2151.86 --> 2154.84]  Now, I'm not saying we're going to fix all that, but I'm just saying, have we listened?
[2155.02 --> 2155.82]  Have we absorbed that?
[2155.86 --> 2157.00]  Have we come to terms with that?
[2158.30 --> 2159.06]  I think we should.
[2160.82 --> 2166.54]  And I think our worship will become distorted without it.
[2166.54 --> 2171.24]  Be part of a community that seeks justice.
[2172.94 --> 2175.02]  Two, to suffer with those who suffer.
[2177.02 --> 2185.60]  A good chunk of my ministry at Pacific Community Church was to, was, we just got caught up in this Cloverdale Community Kitchen.
[2185.60 --> 2189.04]  Monica, she made one of the first lasagnas.
[2189.82 --> 2191.32]  And, well, you know what it's become.
[2192.26 --> 2194.38]  And, you know, the heart of it was?
[2195.42 --> 2200.76]  Was to, was to just hear the stories of people who were suffering.
[2200.76 --> 2204.58]  And they transformed our lives.
[2205.22 --> 2207.64]  They taught me what injustice was.
[2208.64 --> 2213.92]  I could see what I was doing that was shaping their awful reality.
[2214.80 --> 2216.06]  How I ignored them.
[2216.18 --> 2219.22]  How I never knocked on their door when I saw them in trouble.
[2219.22 --> 2222.08]  How I was doing that was happening in trouble.
[2222.08 --> 2223.14]  How I was doing that was happening in trouble.
[2223.14 --> 2224.14]  How I was doing that was happening in trouble.
[2224.14 --> 2230.06]  If you want to learn about some of these things, just serve and get to know people.
[2230.34 --> 2232.14]  Don't show up with a full stomach.
[2232.30 --> 2239.84]  Sit down with a plate of food and just hang out with people who will show you what it means to live a different life than the one you live.
[2240.84 --> 2244.54]  And begin to connect the dots between how you are functioning and they're functioning.
[2245.00 --> 2246.80]  And your complicity in that.
[2249.22 --> 2251.68]  Shouldn't the church be leading in this zone?
[2253.16 --> 2255.80]  Smelling the reality and doing something about it?
[2258.04 --> 2259.80]  Well, be part of a community that seeks justice.
[2260.28 --> 2261.66]  To suffer with those who suffer.
[2262.24 --> 2264.22]  And three, stand up.
[2265.72 --> 2266.78]  Just stand up.
[2268.56 --> 2273.60]  More recently, I came across a situation that made me so angry.
[2275.78 --> 2278.40]  I saw somebody being unjustly treated.
[2279.22 --> 2281.40]  I was so frustrated.
[2282.44 --> 2291.06]  And so, stood beside those people and started reaching out to some of my colleagues and friends and said,
[2291.28 --> 2293.86]  there's something going wrong over here.
[2294.26 --> 2295.34]  It's not right.
[2295.44 --> 2297.34]  This is not the way things should be.
[2297.80 --> 2299.56]  And I'm standing up.
[2299.56 --> 2300.34]  I used those examples.
[2300.34 --> 2301.66]  I'm standing up.
[2302.78 --> 2304.30]  And they get a response back.
[2304.62 --> 2307.54]  They go, well, that's really nice of you, Jim.
[2307.58 --> 2309.62]  But you've got to be careful that you don't cross the line.
[2313.22 --> 2313.70]  Bing!
[2313.70 --> 2315.92]  When is...
[2315.92 --> 2316.92]  When is...
[2316.92 --> 2321.94]  When don't you cross the line when you're standing up for something?
[2325.42 --> 2330.66]  When Jesus was standing up for those who were hungry and hurting or those who were being...
[2330.66 --> 2332.74]  Was he crossing the line?
[2333.38 --> 2334.72]  He was crossing the line.
[2334.78 --> 2335.62]  That's why he got crucified.
[2336.14 --> 2342.22]  He was interrupting people's way of life and their assumptions about what should be...
[2342.22 --> 2344.38]  He was crossing the line.
[2344.38 --> 2350.58]  I think to be justice people, you cross the line.
[2351.78 --> 2359.22]  When there was a bunch of religious people who were going to stone that woman and Jesus comes up alongside,
[2359.56 --> 2363.18]  he stood beside that person and he wrote some words in the sand.
[2363.26 --> 2364.66]  We never know what that is.
[2365.92 --> 2373.94]  But I'm just wondering if it was saying something like, you know, Hebrew words of love or chesed or grace or something.
[2374.38 --> 2377.14]  And he was basically asking those throw...
[2377.14 --> 2379.76]  Rock throwers to say, there's another way.
[2379.82 --> 2381.00]  Why don't you come on to my side?
[2381.44 --> 2386.86]  Why don't we love this woman and grant her freedom and hope and restoration?
[2388.52 --> 2392.02]  Well, nobody joined Jesus with this woman.
[2392.02 --> 2393.42]  They all walked away.
[2393.76 --> 2395.28]  Though they did put their stones down.
[2396.18 --> 2399.34]  But they didn't find the flowers that could maybe transform that situation.
[2404.38 --> 2407.08]  Let's go to the table.
[2411.90 --> 2418.66]  This table is a table that Jesus Christ invites us to.
[2418.66 --> 2427.38]  It represents his body and his blood.
[2428.72 --> 2433.58]  Which he willingly gave to turn the world around.
[2433.58 --> 2437.52]  He gave all of himself.
[2438.48 --> 2440.88]  Not just to get you from here to heaven.
[2441.60 --> 2445.80]  But to empower you with his blood and body.
[2446.18 --> 2450.42]  So that you might be the kind of people who do the same in this world.
[2450.74 --> 2455.26]  Who are willing to give of your life for the sake of others.
[2455.38 --> 2457.58]  Bruce Waltke put it so beautifully.
[2457.58 --> 2463.78]  He says, Christians are the kind of people who would disadvantage themselves to advantage another.
[2464.94 --> 2466.46]  Evil is the opposite.
[2467.06 --> 2469.58]  People take an advantage of, you know...
[2470.18 --> 2471.10]  Taking of a...
[2471.10 --> 2472.16]  How does he put it?
[2472.34 --> 2475.34]  It's basically taking advantage of them for your own advantage.
[2476.06 --> 2476.28]  Right?
[2477.04 --> 2479.08]  Disadvantaging others for your sake.
[2479.50 --> 2480.96]  We turn it around in the gospel.
[2481.08 --> 2481.88]  We transform it.
[2481.92 --> 2483.08]  We turn it upside down.
[2484.80 --> 2486.24]  Life for the sake of others.
[2486.24 --> 2488.66]  And Jesus invites us to this table.
[2490.72 --> 2492.22]  And to each of us.
[2492.24 --> 2495.10]  He says, this is my blood.
[2495.32 --> 2496.16]  It's poured out for you.
[2496.26 --> 2499.04]  For the forgiveness of all sins.
[2500.10 --> 2501.44]  Not just your personal sins.
[2501.50 --> 2502.72]  But the sins of our culture.
[2502.86 --> 2505.88]  The sins of our ways of operating.
[2506.20 --> 2508.08]  Our world views that are so disrupted.
[2508.38 --> 2510.72]  And following the wrong idols.
[2511.92 --> 2514.90]  I come to you with my blood.
[2514.90 --> 2516.46]  I forgive you.
[2517.42 --> 2518.54]  I forgive you.
[2518.54 --> 2518.66]  I make you fresh.
[2518.84 --> 2520.16]  And here's my body.
[2521.20 --> 2522.02]  Where is it?
[2523.76 --> 2527.14]  And my body was torn apart for your sake.
[2529.32 --> 2531.34]  This is the life that you are to live.
[2531.34 --> 2535.16]  Eat and drink with me.
[2535.16 --> 2536.32]  Remember me.
[2537.32 --> 2538.24]  Says Jesus.
[2539.06 --> 2540.18]  And do likewise.
[2544.02 --> 2545.16]  Let's pray.
[2551.12 --> 2552.32]  Lord Jesus.
[2553.90 --> 2556.76]  Your mom knew that you were a revolutionary.
[2556.76 --> 2557.28]  You came.
[2557.28 --> 2557.56]  You came.
[2558.56 --> 2559.52]  You came.
[2560.28 --> 2561.62]  Not just to be nice.
[2561.86 --> 2562.78]  But to stand up.
[2563.42 --> 2565.46]  To confront the powers of this day.
[2567.68 --> 2569.56]  And to transform it.
[2569.68 --> 2571.42]  In such a way that all things.
[2572.58 --> 2573.78]  Would be made new.
[2575.00 --> 2575.82]  Your miracles.
[2577.10 --> 2577.86]  Your words.
[2579.08 --> 2579.78]  The way you.
[2580.50 --> 2581.60]  Used power.
[2582.46 --> 2583.10]  To bless.
[2584.10 --> 2584.76]  Was transformational.
[2584.76 --> 2585.40]  Transformational.
[2586.90 --> 2588.10]  And you've called us.
[2588.16 --> 2588.64]  Your church.
[2588.92 --> 2590.24]  To live out this.
[2590.46 --> 2591.66]  In a like manner.
[2592.38 --> 2593.74]  And we stumble along.
[2593.82 --> 2594.84]  And we goof it up.
[2596.72 --> 2598.98]  But you continue to invite us to this table.
[2599.32 --> 2600.48]  You want us to be.
[2601.74 --> 2603.54]  In sync with who you are.
[2603.70 --> 2605.28]  And how your spirit is leading us.
[2605.36 --> 2606.68]  And so as we come to this table.
[2606.80 --> 2608.58]  We want to remember you.
[2608.58 --> 2612.66]  We need to be refreshed by you.
[2613.60 --> 2615.56]  We need to be made new by you.
[2617.16 --> 2620.30]  And we need to be as sensitive as you.
[2620.52 --> 2621.86]  So that we can smell.
[2622.66 --> 2623.46]  What's wrong.
[2624.14 --> 2625.96]  And be emboldened.
[2626.10 --> 2627.10]  To knock on a door.
[2627.50 --> 2628.94]  And to rally communities.
[2628.94 --> 2629.92]  To do good together.
[2630.92 --> 2631.78]  And so Lord.
[2631.86 --> 2633.04]  As we come to this table.
[2634.04 --> 2635.60]  Forgive us our sins.
[2635.60 --> 2637.94]  Grant us hope.
[2638.72 --> 2639.76]  Enliven us.
[2640.74 --> 2642.66]  Make us newer today.
[2642.82 --> 2644.92]  Than what we were yesterday.
[2647.32 --> 2649.26]  Please do this work amongst us.
[2649.94 --> 2650.86]  We pray this.
[2651.48 --> 2652.48]  In Jesus name.
[2653.48 --> 2653.76]  Amen.
[2653.76 --> 2653.90]  Amen.
[2657.24 --> 2658.26]  We're going to have.
[2659.56 --> 2660.66]  Four stations.
[2660.66 --> 2665.10]  And I'm going to invite you.
[2665.20 --> 2666.14]  To make your way.
[2666.22 --> 2667.62]  To each of the four stations.
[2668.46 --> 2669.84]  But I want you to do something.
[2670.02 --> 2670.96]  Maybe a little bit different.
[2671.10 --> 2672.72]  But not a big difference.
[2673.66 --> 2675.12]  But it's symbolically.
[2676.12 --> 2676.56]  Good.
[2678.22 --> 2679.20]  I don't think.
[2679.20 --> 2680.38]  When we come to the table.
[2680.56 --> 2681.16]  We should take.
[2682.14 --> 2683.04]  Or grab.
[2684.24 --> 2685.28]  We should receive.
[2687.16 --> 2687.64]  Because.
[2688.56 --> 2689.66]  We're all in need.
[2689.66 --> 2693.20]  We come to the table.
[2693.38 --> 2694.30]  I'm going to encourage you.
[2695.22 --> 2695.62]  Physically.
[2696.20 --> 2696.56]  Symbolically.
[2696.98 --> 2697.82]  Just to reach out.
[2700.00 --> 2700.70]  In readiness.
[2700.96 --> 2701.60]  To receive.
[2702.02 --> 2703.32]  And the people at the table.
[2703.46 --> 2704.36]  Who are your host.
[2705.10 --> 2706.62]  Will put the bread in your hand first.
[2707.74 --> 2708.62]  And then the cup.
[2708.68 --> 2709.86]  And you can hold on to the cup.
[2710.14 --> 2711.02]  And they will say to you.
[2711.04 --> 2712.50]  And I want you to look at them.
[2712.52 --> 2713.24]  In their eyes.
[2713.30 --> 2713.62]  Because this.
[2713.82 --> 2714.34]  This is.
[2715.34 --> 2716.74]  This is who we are.
[2717.48 --> 2719.06]  We're at Jesus table.
[2719.66 --> 2721.84]  And they will say to you.
[2721.88 --> 2722.82]  This is the body.
[2722.82 --> 2723.44]  And blood.
[2723.58 --> 2724.32]  Of Jesus Christ.
[2725.12 --> 2725.96]  Don't leave the table.
[2726.02 --> 2727.02]  Without hearing those words.
[2727.30 --> 2728.12]  And looking them in the eye.
[2728.32 --> 2729.72]  And if you need to say something back.
[2729.80 --> 2729.96]  Go.
[2730.68 --> 2731.70]  Praise be to God.
[2732.80 --> 2733.58]  Then eat it.
[2733.66 --> 2734.24]  And drink it.
[2734.38 --> 2734.70]  There.
[2734.86 --> 2735.66]  Or on your way.
[2735.78 --> 2737.00]  Or while you're sitting down.
[2738.26 --> 2738.60]  And.
[2739.06 --> 2739.62]  Eat it.
[2739.78 --> 2740.80]  Like it's a meal.
[2741.60 --> 2742.42]  Being nourished.
[2743.06 --> 2744.36]  For all that God wants you to do.
[2744.36 --> 2746.36]  Make sense.
[2748.32 --> 2750.60]  I invite you to come to the table.
[2750.60 --> 2780.58]  Thank you.
