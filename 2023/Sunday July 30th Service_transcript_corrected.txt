[0.00 → 3.54] Well, good morning, Hope.
[6.60 → 8.58] I don't necessarily like this stand.
[10.64 → 13.18] Well, as our Cornerstone kids are making their way out,
[13.30 → 17.14] I just want to give another sing of appreciation for our teachers
[17.14 → 20.82] who's been at it, practicing, helping our kids learn this prayer
[20.82 → 23.98] and this song as we lift our prayers to God.
[24.16 → 26.52] It wasn't just a performance, not a presentation,
[26.84 → 29.92] but their prayers and from their hearts to God.
[30.44 → 34.58] So we want to, if they can hear us, give a big applause for our teachers.
[35.22 → 36.40] Thank you so much.
[37.00 → 38.02] Thank you, Cornerstone.
[41.80 → 44.82] And though it wasn't designed this way,
[44.82 → 49.22] it is just so fitting that today's beatitude that we get to witness to
[49.22 → 55.74] blesses us and reminds us of our own identities as children of God.
[55.84 → 58.98] As we get to witness and enjoy the blessing we have
[58.98 → 62.30] of so many children at our church offer up their prayers.
[62.70 → 64.76] Now, before we get to God's Word this morning,
[64.76 → 69.76] I do want to encourage and remind everybody that we have a second offering today.
[69.96 → 72.96] So our second offering that we usually do maybe once a month
[72.96 → 79.48] is we do a special donation and offering for different needs of our community and our church.
[79.48 → 84.48] For this month, we decided that we are going to give to the Hope Care Fund.
[85.10 → 91.50] And what the Hope Care Fund is, is we entrust our deacons, our body of deacons,
[91.74 → 95.30] to use the funds for the needs of those around us.
[95.30 → 101.20] In the past, we've used these funds to help people who's gone through maybe fires,
[101.74 → 105.74] natural disasters, I mean fires or floods that we had a couple of years back,
[106.02 → 108.34] and people who need help getting counselling,
[108.62 → 112.14] going through some mental health challenges, etc., etc.
[112.14 → 115.86] There is a lot of need, obviously, that is within our church,
[116.06 → 117.52] all around us in our community.
[118.02 → 121.68] And so I encourage you to give today on the app or in the back.
[121.78 → 123.56] We have the debit machine, even cash.
[123.78 → 129.40] If you would like to give in that way, it is our second offering this morning.
[130.28 → 132.74] And so, back to our seventh beatitude.
[132.90 → 136.28] If you've been following with us, if you've been listening to our sermons,
[136.48 → 140.86] the series, we've been looking at all the beatitudes found in Matthew 5.
[140.86 → 143.94] And the beatitude we have is our seventh one.
[144.30 → 149.04] It's not necessarily that special seven because there are more beatitudes coming up.
[149.50 → 153.94] But I do want to bless us again hearing Jesus' words.
[154.34 → 158.20] But I'd rather have it so that we read it together instead of just hearing my voice
[158.20 → 160.82] being and representing Jesus' words.
[161.30 → 164.74] And so we have the beatitudes, all the ones that we've read so far,
[164.96 → 166.18] up on the screen for you.
[166.18 → 170.60] If you can follow along and read the beatitudes together.
[170.86 → 171.70] That would be wonderful.
[172.64 → 175.66] And so here are the words from Jesus himself who blesses us.
[176.30 → 180.92] Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[181.78 → 185.66] Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[186.48 → 189.74] Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
[190.54 → 193.96] Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[193.96 → 196.10] for they will be filled.
[197.00 → 201.68] Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
[201.88 → 204.34] You should have it memorized anyway, so you don't need the screen.
[205.62 → 208.34] Blessed are the and this was from a couple of weeks ago,
[208.74 → 210.84] blessed are the pure in heart.
[210.84 → 220.60] And today, blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
[221.40 → 226.30] So a couple of weeks ago, pure in heart, honest, bringing our whole selves to God,
[226.72 → 230.40] and giving us, and Jesus giving us a promise that we would get to see him,
[230.72 → 235.06] get to see his face, which is a very huge claim to make.
[235.42 → 236.54] Very significant promise.
[236.54 → 240.64] And today, he says, following up, you are peacemakers.
[240.74 → 244.02] Remember, all these Beatitudes are describing one person.
[244.76 → 246.88] One, or I should say every person.
[247.18 → 253.90] Every Christian, our meek, our merciful, our humble, our gentle, they are peacemakers.
[254.76 → 256.14] They are peacemakers.
[256.90 → 258.98] And so thinking about our Beatitude,
[259.38 → 262.94] I want to suggest that this particular Beatitude
[262.94 → 265.12] wraps up all the other Beatitudes
[265.12 → 268.62] and thrusts it into a mission perspective.
[269.60 → 273.12] A mission perspective, meaning it is something that is given to us
[273.12 → 275.86] to take and to reach out to the world,
[276.02 → 279.08] to live out our identities as a blessing,
[279.40 → 280.54] a blessing for the world.
[280.90 → 282.08] They say it over and over again,
[282.50 → 284.72] you are blessed to be a blessing for the world.
[284.88 → 285.88] That's our mission.
[286.68 → 288.94] And our particular Beatitude today,
[288.94 → 290.20] to be peacemakers,
[290.74 → 291.80] reflects that mission.
[291.80 → 295.50] And so, thinking about this particular one,
[295.80 → 297.22] we are called children of God.
[297.86 → 300.58] It made me think about, obviously, our children here,
[300.86 → 303.12] and specifically for me, my own son, Joseph.
[303.96 → 307.34] As I suggested that this Beatitude reflects a mission outlook,
[307.66 → 310.20] it reflects what God's children look like.
[310.30 → 312.90] We are called His children, part of His family.
[313.24 → 316.04] And quite literally, like our own children
[316.04 → 318.70] who we raise and bring up in faith together,
[318.70 → 321.48] not just within our homes,
[321.58 → 323.18] but together as a faith community,
[323.38 → 324.58] we bring up our children.
[325.06 → 327.22] And much like our children and ourselves,
[327.82 → 330.34] God's children also mess up,
[330.68 → 333.78] and they need their parents to be there for them.
[334.08 → 336.48] That's exactly what we live into.
[337.04 → 337.80] And so I remember,
[338.18 → 340.64] when our family moved back to Canada in 2019,
[340.64 → 342.00] after having worked in Korea,
[342.00 → 343.72] Joseph was born in Korea,
[343.72 → 347.04] and we moved back and found our place in Langley,
[347.26 → 348.32] this is where we live now.
[348.88 → 351.92] And, as any good young Canadian family would do,
[352.42 → 356.52] we furnish our house with as many Swedish carpentry furniture
[356.52 → 357.68] as we can afford.
[358.54 → 359.34] And so the laugh,
[359.60 → 361.26] you understand what I am talking about.
[361.26 → 364.44] This obviously meant a lot of tedious work
[364.44 → 366.76] of unwrapping, unscrewing,
[367.02 → 369.60] putting together large Lego-like pieces of furniture.
[370.78 → 372.08] And as we did this,
[372.18 → 373.12] so my wife and I,
[373.58 → 376.26] Joseph was about two to three years old at the time,
[376.58 → 378.52] an age where he thought he could help out
[378.52 → 381.18] and even do a better job of putting together
[381.18 → 383.80] these complicated furniture better than I could.
[384.64 → 387.36] And like any dad that tries to be a good father,
[387.98 → 389.24] and this is the key part, I think,
[389.24 → 392.04] I helped him help me.
[392.74 → 393.90] You understand the concept.
[394.50 → 396.82] I helped him so that he can help me.
[397.54 → 399.84] And I allowed my son and gave him the confidence
[399.84 → 400.86] as much as I could,
[401.20 → 403.70] and the encouragement to join my mission.
[404.32 → 404.98] And my mission?
[405.28 → 406.10] To furnish our home.
[406.78 → 409.48] And I encouraged, and I tried to equip Joseph
[409.48 → 410.84] to join that mission.
[411.58 → 414.10] And that's the teaching point that I took away here.
[414.82 → 417.22] It only took the first crew to see
[417.22 → 419.56] and also experience and feel
[419.56 → 423.08] that my mission of furnishing our home
[423.08 → 425.68] has gotten much, much more difficult
[425.68 → 427.28] with Joseph in the venture.
[428.60 → 430.46] And that's, and quite literally,
[430.84 → 432.16] is when I had the God moment.
[432.82 → 434.98] I felt, and I observed
[434.98 → 438.00] that just like how it's difficult for me
[438.00 → 440.42] to do my job of furnishing my home,
[440.82 → 441.32] our home,
[441.32 → 444.60] God has probably,
[445.28 → 447.24] and based on Scripture is what I find,
[447.74 → 451.94] is that God probably has a much, much harder task
[451.94 → 453.66] now that we,
[454.24 → 454.90] his children,
[455.04 → 456.00] his broken children,
[456.10 → 456.88] the way we are,
[457.28 → 458.42] have joined his mission.
[459.12 → 460.36] He has allowed us,
[460.70 → 461.30] blessed us,
[461.48 → 462.28] equipped us
[462.28 → 463.66] to join his mission
[463.66 → 464.46] when,
[465.24 → 466.24] when you think about it,
[466.50 → 468.12] thinking about our sovereign God
[468.12 → 469.28] and the way he is
[469.28 → 470.28] and who he is,
[470.52 → 471.88] could snap his fingers like this
[471.88 → 472.20] and say,
[472.34 → 472.58] done,
[473.04 → 473.58] restored,
[473.88 → 475.06] the way it's supposed to be.
[476.30 → 476.74] But no,
[477.16 → 478.66] the beautiful part is,
[478.88 → 479.40] he says,
[479.60 → 481.58] I am not going to just snap my fingers,
[481.98 → 483.86] I am actually going to send my son
[483.86 → 485.24] to go through the hard work
[485.24 → 487.38] of living a human life,
[487.66 → 489.78] to take all the brokenness of the world
[489.78 → 491.72] and die in its place,
[492.02 → 492.54] and,
[493.42 → 494.14] plus that,
[494.14 → 495.74] I am now going to equip
[495.74 → 496.82] and train
[496.82 → 498.70] and restore broken people
[498.70 → 499.80] as my children
[499.80 → 501.46] to join my mission
[501.46 → 503.12] of restoring the rest of creation,
[503.46 → 505.30] including all of his children.
[506.46 → 507.54] Much easier
[507.54 → 509.46] if he did it by himself.
[509.58 → 510.04] Do you understand?
[511.56 → 513.18] And so that's the amazing part
[513.18 → 515.54] and that is good news for us.
[515.84 → 518.28] That is the gospel for us this morning
[518.28 → 520.70] because it is the ongoing work
[520.70 → 521.70] of God's grace
[521.70 → 523.68] in our everyday lives
[523.68 → 525.60] where the blood of Jesus redeems
[525.60 → 527.30] and his Holy Spirit equips,
[527.52 → 528.44] as I keep on saying.
[528.74 → 530.94] He does that ongoing
[530.94 → 532.66] in our own lives.
[533.04 → 534.06] Everyone here
[534.06 → 535.54] listening to this,
[536.22 → 537.56] listening to his scripture,
[538.46 → 539.60] being in his presence,
[540.04 → 541.92] we are equipped to do so.
[543.06 → 544.52] We get the privilege
[544.52 → 546.60] and it is quite the privilege,
[547.06 → 549.10] not some sort of religious tedious work
[549.10 → 549.98] that we need to do,
[549.98 → 552.22] not some sort of religious obligation
[552.22 → 553.34] that we have to do,
[553.54 → 554.98] but it is a privilege
[554.98 → 556.18] of participating
[556.18 → 557.56] and restoring the way
[557.56 → 560.06] to the way it's supposed to be.
[560.62 → 561.38] God's mission,
[561.48 → 562.04] not ours,
[562.56 → 563.84] joining God's mission
[563.84 → 564.34] of restoring.
[564.78 → 565.88] And part of this,
[566.28 → 566.52] then,
[566.62 → 567.26] for us,
[568.02 → 569.70] is to be more Christ-like,
[570.06 → 571.56] to walk in the way
[571.56 → 572.58] of blessing
[572.58 → 573.72] and flourish
[573.72 → 575.02] as human beings,
[575.32 → 576.70] created in God's image.
[576.84 → 578.16] And we looked at a lot of that
[578.16 → 579.52] through Mike's sermon last week.
[579.52 → 580.62] What does it mean
[580.62 → 581.56] to be flourishing,
[581.76 → 582.68] to walk in the way
[582.68 → 583.86] of blessing in your lives?
[584.38 → 585.72] Whether it be Marnie's spaghetti
[585.72 → 587.82] or your own menu
[587.82 → 588.96] that you like the best,
[589.18 → 590.72] or whether it's enjoying
[590.72 → 591.64] the 21 kids
[591.64 → 592.48] in one household
[592.48 → 594.10] for a whole week or so,
[594.76 → 596.18] I'm not sure if I would call that
[596.18 → 597.26] flourishing for me,
[597.78 → 599.38] but whatever that blessing
[599.38 → 600.22] looks like,
[600.82 → 601.96] that's the way
[601.96 → 604.04] that Christ invites you into.
[604.04 → 606.34] And then the other side of that
[606.34 → 607.14] in our rebellion,
[607.74 → 608.20] obviously,
[608.50 → 609.82] is the way of course.
[610.70 → 612.08] And it's our brokenness.
[612.70 → 615.70] And Christ has proclaimed victory,
[616.14 → 616.78] and He said,
[617.04 → 617.38] Shalom,
[617.88 → 618.28] peace,
[618.58 → 620.38] over all of that brokenness.
[620.84 → 622.36] And that's the good news.
[623.42 → 624.24] In this way,
[624.70 → 625.40] like I said,
[625.88 → 628.00] that we learned from Mike last week,
[628.00 → 630.40] we get to live into this story,
[630.74 → 632.88] this whole biblical grand narrative,
[634.08 → 635.42] and the blessing to be a blessing
[635.42 → 640.20] starts with Genesis 12,
[640.86 → 641.20] Abraham.
[641.60 → 642.64] And we live into this
[642.64 → 644.02] Abrahamic blessing
[644.02 → 646.30] to be a light for the world,
[646.48 → 647.72] as Jesus said Himself,
[648.08 → 649.92] you are light for the world,
[650.24 → 652.32] you are a city in a tunnel?
[653.26 → 653.56] No.
[653.92 → 655.62] You are a city on a hill
[655.62 → 657.26] for everyone to see.
[657.26 → 658.48] That is your mission.
[659.20 → 660.26] Whether you like it or not,
[660.68 → 662.66] when you are blessed by God,
[662.90 → 665.00] when you are blessed by His Scriptures,
[665.32 → 666.80] and you are equipped by His Spirit,
[667.44 → 668.90] you don't have a choice
[668.90 → 672.52] other than to radiate that light,
[672.94 → 674.68] radiate that blessing for the world,
[674.88 → 677.14] which we will look further into today.
[677.62 → 680.24] That's what it means to be peacemakers.
[681.16 → 682.54] And that is good news,
[682.60 → 683.08] once again.
[683.50 → 684.02] Gospel.
[684.02 → 686.18] We wait and anticipate it
[686.18 → 687.78] with joyful and hopeful hearts
[687.78 → 690.12] because we get to be peacemakers
[690.12 → 693.66] and not just peace seekers or desirers.
[694.32 → 696.80] We are called partners with God Himself.
[698.02 → 700.12] That is such dignity.
[700.58 → 702.76] It is such a calling to be His children,
[703.12 → 704.86] to be makers of peace with Him.
[704.86 → 709.24] And before we get to how this peacemaking actually matters
[709.24 → 712.18] and how it actually pans out in our everyday lives,
[712.32 → 713.04] in our offices,
[713.30 → 714.06] in our workplaces,
[714.26 → 715.28] in our homes,
[715.36 → 716.04] in our schools,
[716.76 → 717.82] before we get there,
[718.42 → 722.84] how did the original hearers of Jesus' words Himself,
[723.08 → 724.46] His words itself,
[724.64 → 725.98] how did they hear it?
[726.26 → 727.10] When they heard,
[727.46 → 729.10] blessed are the peacemakers,
[729.10 → 732.00] how did they hear this word peace?
[732.16 → 733.26] And what were the thoughts
[733.26 → 734.80] that rang through their minds
[734.80 → 735.98] as they heard this?
[736.78 → 739.12] Well, we got the education session from last week.
[739.28 → 741.18] We know how the Jews would have heard it.
[742.14 → 742.60] But then,
[743.10 → 743.48] we're not,
[743.82 → 744.30] we're not,
[744.94 → 747.10] Jesus is not just preaching in Judea
[747.10 → 748.70] and in the Jewish world.
[749.08 → 751.50] This Jewish world that Jesus is living in
[751.50 → 752.62] right now at this point,
[752.82 → 753.86] in the first century,
[754.24 → 755.76] is the Roman Empire.
[755.76 → 756.90] And so,
[757.00 → 757.84] we have to think,
[758.16 → 761.24] how did the Romans also receive this message?
[761.70 → 762.48] The Gentiles,
[762.60 → 763.14] the foreigners,
[763.48 → 765.70] that we're hearing this Jewish man
[765.70 → 767.86] talk about bringing peace for the world.
[768.50 → 770.26] What kind of claim are you making?
[770.54 → 772.58] We have a rough idea of what peace is.
[772.76 → 774.14] We have our version.
[774.88 → 775.42] What's yours?
[775.80 → 777.68] Why are you saying that yours is different?
[779.10 → 779.62] So,
[779.94 → 781.62] this word that we use today,
[782.58 → 782.98] gospel.
[783.70 → 784.34] Many of you,
[784.34 → 785.50] if you grew up in the church,
[785.76 → 788.00] you know that the Greek word for gospel,
[788.40 → 789.80] which just simply means good news,
[790.08 → 791.90] is evangelion.
[792.36 → 794.18] It's where we get the term evangelism,
[794.36 → 794.56] right?
[795.00 → 797.14] It's to preach and proclaim the good news.
[797.90 → 798.46] Evangelion.
[798.74 → 802.26] But this Greek word actually has so much significance
[802.26 → 803.36] in the Roman Empire
[803.36 → 805.44] because this same Greek word
[805.44 → 807.68] was used to refer to news
[807.68 → 809.62] that came from the Roman Emperor himself.
[810.68 → 812.00] When the Roman Emperor,
[812.00 → 813.20] when the Caesar said,
[813.20 → 815.04] I am bringing peace,
[815.52 → 817.66] I am establishing my empire,
[817.66 → 820.36] and I think my empire is the best,
[820.66 → 821.96] is the most successful,
[822.74 → 824.86] they used the word evangelion
[824.86 → 826.36] to proclaim this news.
[826.36 → 828.02] And so,
[828.18 → 829.58] for the gospel writers
[829.58 → 831.26] to use that same word
[831.26 → 832.18] to preach
[832.18 → 833.74] the kingdom of heaven,
[834.08 → 835.94] the kingdom that Jesus brings in,
[836.28 → 837.84] it's a direct stand
[837.84 → 839.94] against the culture of the time,
[840.40 → 842.24] a direct stand against the empires.
[842.60 → 842.80] So,
[842.84 → 844.16] here's the picture as we have it.
[844.44 → 845.22] On one side,
[845.30 → 846.10] you have Jesus
[846.10 → 848.38] proclaiming that he is the Son of God,
[848.62 → 849.64] he is the Messiah
[849.64 → 850.42] that is promised
[850.42 → 851.50] in the Jewish Bible,
[851.50 → 852.90] in the grand narratives
[852.90 → 853.74] of the biblical story
[853.74 → 855.02] as we have it in the Old Testament.
[855.02 → 856.06] Jesus says,
[856.40 → 858.04] I am that Messiah,
[858.48 → 859.86] and prophet Isaiah says,
[859.98 → 861.46] that Messiah is named
[861.46 → 862.88] the Prince of Peace.
[864.14 → 864.66] Okay,
[864.80 → 865.16] so Jesus,
[865.28 → 865.58] you're saying,
[865.70 → 867.42] you're the Prince of Shalom,
[867.62 → 867.96] Peace.
[868.54 → 869.92] And then on the other side,
[870.22 → 871.72] based in that same boat,
[872.10 → 872.92] are the Jews
[872.92 → 874.90] who thought of that Shalom
[874.90 → 876.06] in their own way,
[876.56 → 876.94] thinking,
[877.18 → 878.54] we have two swords,
[878.62 → 879.16] is that enough?
[879.74 → 880.82] Do you remember from last week?
[881.60 → 882.26] The disciples,
[882.52 → 883.24] their idea of,
[883.24 → 884.12] Jesus is saying,
[884.38 → 884.60] okay,
[884.72 → 885.82] we're going to Jerusalem now.
[886.54 → 886.82] Oh,
[887.48 → 889.08] the revolt has finally started.
[889.74 → 892.14] The conquest that we have done
[892.14 → 892.90] in the past,
[893.00 → 893.96] like through Joshua,
[894.22 → 895.44] we are now going to do
[895.44 → 896.40] that same thing again
[896.40 → 898.06] and conquer all those
[898.06 → 898.94] bad,
[899.10 → 900.28] evil Gentiles,
[900.58 → 901.04] the Romans.
[901.42 → 902.74] Let's overpower them
[902.74 → 903.56] and make
[903.56 → 904.52] Shalom,
[905.40 → 905.68] Peace.
[905.68 → 907.06] So Jesus,
[907.42 → 908.06] Prince of Peace,
[908.26 → 909.06] and then the Jews
[909.06 → 910.14] in their version
[910.14 → 911.78] of overpowering other people
[911.78 → 913.24] for their version of peace.
[913.32 → 914.02] And then lastly,
[914.54 → 915.60] you have the Romans
[915.60 → 916.92] who proclaim
[916.92 → 918.12] and boasted of,
[918.88 → 919.42] anyone know
[919.42 → 920.62] what this 200-year span
[920.62 → 921.06] was called?
[921.72 → 922.34] What the Romans
[922.34 → 923.20] called their peace?
[924.36 → 925.30] Somebody said it.
[925.86 → 926.56] Pax Romana.
[926.66 → 927.10] Thank you.
[927.60 → 928.32] Pax Romana.
[929.12 → 930.38] Latin for peace of Rome.
[930.38 → 932.58] In this roughly
[932.58 → 934.00] 200-year span
[934.00 → 935.24] of what the historians
[935.24 → 936.34] called the Pax Romana,
[936.86 → 938.00] in the first century,
[938.44 → 939.28] the Roman Empire
[939.28 → 940.42] enjoyed many,
[940.54 → 942.06] many prosperous achievements.
[942.92 → 944.84] But the important part here is
[944.84 → 946.30] the way that this
[946.30 → 947.50] prosperous way,
[947.74 → 947.92] this,
[948.22 → 949.18] what they called peace,
[949.48 → 950.24] was achieved
[950.24 → 951.28] and maintained
[951.28 → 952.58] and even defined
[952.58 → 955.46] was fundamentally different.
[955.88 → 957.18] It was upside down
[957.18 → 958.48] than what Jesus
[958.48 → 959.36] was proclaiming.
[960.38 → 962.48] Just a quick research
[962.48 → 963.38] of Pax Romana
[963.38 → 964.30] and the historians
[964.30 → 965.30] will define this peace
[965.30 → 965.86] in this way.
[966.72 → 968.56] A relatively quiet period
[968.56 → 969.36] of time,
[970.20 → 972.12] absent of significant wars
[972.12 → 974.00] and some innovative developments
[974.00 → 974.96] in academics,
[975.50 → 976.74] in trade and commerce.
[977.42 → 978.66] That's the Roman version
[978.66 → 979.28] of peace.
[979.84 → 980.70] It sounds okay.
[981.64 → 983.24] Lots of innovative projects.
[983.54 → 985.30] They built so many roads.
[985.64 → 986.80] It is a wonder.
[987.02 → 988.42] It's a historical wonder.
[988.84 → 989.42] And ironically,
[989.42 → 990.48] God even uses
[990.48 → 991.32] those developments
[991.32 → 992.74] that Caesar's
[992.74 → 993.46] and the Roman Empire
[993.46 → 995.20] had in their own agenda.
[995.54 → 996.32] And what did God
[996.32 → 997.08] use that for?
[997.84 → 998.76] He used that
[998.76 → 1000.04] and those same roads
[1000.04 → 1000.84] to spread the gospel
[1000.84 → 1002.18] to the whole wide world
[1002.18 → 1002.86] as they had it
[1002.86 → 1004.50] in their context.
[1005.34 → 1006.72] That's the way God works
[1006.72 → 1007.60] in mysterious ways.
[1007.84 → 1008.22] But anyway,
[1008.30 → 1008.94] back to the point.
[1009.38 → 1011.56] Romans built their empire
[1011.56 → 1013.60] and had lots of good things
[1013.60 → 1014.46] that came out of it.
[1014.60 → 1015.66] And they called it peace.
[1015.66 → 1019.86] But underlying all of that peace
[1019.86 → 1024.26] was so much brokenness.
[1025.12 → 1026.02] There's no other word
[1026.02 → 1026.68] to put it.
[1027.04 → 1028.34] There's so much hatred
[1028.34 → 1030.00] through civil wars,
[1030.16 → 1031.78] deceit, corruption,
[1032.22 → 1033.68] lots and lots of bloodshed.
[1034.00 → 1036.16] Now I taught this period of time,
[1036.24 → 1036.78] ancient history,
[1036.86 → 1037.42] when I was a teacher
[1037.42 → 1038.04] back in Korea.
[1038.10 → 1039.00] I was a history teacher.
[1039.68 → 1041.46] And one detail
[1041.46 → 1042.72] that I still remember is
[1042.72 → 1043.98] the Roman Empire
[1043.98 → 1044.70] is because there were
[1044.70 → 1045.52] so many people
[1045.52 → 1046.52] that were rioting
[1046.52 → 1047.52] and were not satisfied
[1047.52 → 1048.54] with the Roman Empire.
[1048.82 → 1049.80] What they did was
[1049.80 → 1050.88] they started creating
[1050.88 → 1051.82] a lot of venues
[1051.82 → 1052.50] for gambling,
[1052.98 → 1053.54] for drinking,
[1054.10 → 1054.94] for violence,
[1055.10 → 1055.98] gladiator fights
[1055.98 → 1057.72] to quiet the crowd.
[1058.28 → 1059.26] They were trying to
[1059.26 → 1060.22] just sweep
[1060.22 → 1061.28] all the problems
[1061.28 → 1061.78] that they had
[1061.78 → 1062.38] under the carpet
[1062.38 → 1063.50] and said,
[1063.66 → 1064.50] everyone's satisfied?
[1064.92 → 1065.96] You have enough booze?
[1066.04 → 1067.42] You have enough entertainment?
[1067.78 → 1068.48] Now be quiet.
[1068.48 → 1069.48] If you're not going
[1069.48 → 1070.06] to be quiet,
[1070.36 → 1070.88] we're just going
[1070.88 → 1072.06] to suppress you anyway.
[1072.50 → 1072.86] And we're going
[1072.86 → 1073.74] to call this peace.
[1075.90 → 1077.36] And so tyrannical emperors
[1077.36 → 1077.84] like this
[1077.84 → 1079.46] killed political rivals even
[1079.46 → 1080.48] as Rome brutally
[1081.08 → 1082.16] suppressed revolts
[1082.16 → 1082.80] in provinces
[1082.80 → 1084.12] such as Judea,
[1084.38 → 1085.50] which is the context
[1085.50 → 1086.74] that Jesus is preaching in.
[1087.26 → 1088.06] That's the land
[1088.06 → 1088.56] of the Jews.
[1088.86 → 1089.54] And so they were just
[1089.54 → 1090.62] suppressing everyone
[1090.62 → 1091.82] with their force.
[1092.48 → 1093.36] And people were
[1093.36 → 1094.18] getting sick of it.
[1094.88 → 1095.92] This left one person
[1095.92 → 1096.62] during this period
[1096.62 → 1098.10] saying that the Romans
[1098.10 → 1099.92] created a desolation,
[1100.28 → 1101.28] a desolation
[1101.28 → 1103.58] and called it peace.
[1104.14 → 1104.80] Pax Romana.
[1106.32 → 1107.08] And then just a quick
[1107.08 → 1108.14] reminder from last week,
[1108.46 → 1110.04] the Jews thinking
[1110.04 → 1111.28] that Jesus' disciples,
[1111.40 → 1112.00] we have two swords,
[1112.08 → 1112.58] is that enough?
[1113.06 → 1113.52] The Romans,
[1113.66 → 1114.58] if a Roman citizen
[1114.58 → 1115.76] heard that little comment,
[1116.52 → 1117.34] they would laugh
[1117.34 → 1117.88] in their face
[1117.88 → 1118.34] and say,
[1118.56 → 1119.56] good luck
[1119.56 → 1120.72] with your little
[1120.72 → 1121.18] two swords.
[1121.82 → 1122.72] Let's see if you can
[1122.72 → 1123.92] out power,
[1124.48 → 1125.50] overpower,
[1125.50 → 1126.08] I should say,
[1126.18 → 1126.98] the Roman Empire
[1126.98 → 1127.74] as we have it.
[1128.94 → 1129.72] And then
[1129.72 → 1131.64] comes Jesus,
[1132.34 → 1133.44] riding on a donkey,
[1134.52 → 1135.54] born in a manger,
[1136.16 → 1137.40] oh great king of kings,
[1137.64 → 1138.20] good start.
[1139.16 → 1140.90] He comes as a lowly servant.
[1142.02 → 1143.00] He doesn't come
[1143.00 → 1144.30] overpowering everyone
[1144.30 → 1145.76] with his majestic
[1145.76 → 1146.62] godly power.
[1146.82 → 1148.82] He comes as a lowly servant,
[1149.58 → 1151.24] giving up his own life
[1151.24 → 1152.44] and calls it love
[1152.44 → 1153.06] and peace.
[1154.18 → 1155.64] Very upside down
[1155.64 → 1156.66] from the world
[1156.66 → 1157.72] that they lived in.
[1158.74 → 1159.46] And what Jesus
[1159.46 → 1160.42] preaches
[1160.42 → 1162.18] is that God's kingdom
[1162.18 → 1163.48] is finally here.
[1163.92 → 1164.80] And he calls
[1164.80 → 1166.06] his own disciples
[1166.06 → 1167.82] not to pick up
[1167.82 → 1168.62] their swords,
[1168.96 → 1170.66] but to lay it down.
[1171.30 → 1172.82] And he preaches peace
[1172.82 → 1175.18] to not seek revenge
[1175.18 → 1176.06] against enemies,
[1176.26 → 1177.32] but to love
[1177.32 → 1178.30] your enemies.
[1178.84 → 1180.28] Not even just tolerate them,
[1180.28 → 1181.36] but to love
[1181.36 → 1182.04] your enemies,
[1182.20 → 1182.44] really?
[1182.90 → 1183.84] And to turn
[1183.84 → 1184.56] the other cheek?
[1185.10 → 1186.68] To give your own garments
[1186.68 → 1187.82] as a sign of peace?
[1188.78 → 1189.30] Really?
[1189.50 → 1190.36] That's your definition
[1190.36 → 1191.24] of peace, Jesus?
[1192.74 → 1194.36] And Jesus preaches peace
[1194.36 → 1195.30] not as some
[1195.30 → 1196.22] inner tranquility
[1196.22 → 1196.54] like,
[1197.08 → 1197.38] oh,
[1197.50 → 1198.48] now I'm peaceful.
[1199.14 → 1200.56] Or the simple
[1200.56 → 1201.94] absence of war
[1201.94 → 1203.54] that the Romans
[1203.54 → 1204.74] tried to enforce.
[1205.54 → 1206.34] Absence of war
[1206.34 → 1206.92] and conflict
[1206.92 → 1208.00] is very significant
[1208.00 → 1209.18] and it is
[1209.18 → 1210.02] shalom and peace,
[1210.02 → 1210.74] but that's not
[1210.74 → 1211.38] all of it.
[1211.68 → 1211.90] Why?
[1212.02 → 1213.22] Because Jesus comes
[1213.22 → 1214.12] and he preaches
[1214.12 → 1215.28] shalom in the face
[1215.28 → 1216.26] of the cause
[1216.26 → 1217.42] of all division
[1217.42 → 1218.52] and the brokenness
[1218.52 → 1219.70] and the sicknesses
[1219.70 → 1220.56] and the diseases
[1220.56 → 1221.68] and all the conflicts
[1221.68 → 1222.58] that happen
[1222.58 → 1224.36] from the cause,
[1224.94 → 1226.40] which is sin.
[1227.34 → 1228.48] And Jesus proclaims
[1228.48 → 1230.42] victory over sin,
[1230.74 → 1231.60] not just,
[1232.00 → 1232.30] all right,
[1232.34 → 1232.64] everyone,
[1232.78 → 1233.38] calm down,
[1233.64 → 1234.28] find some sort
[1234.28 → 1235.18] of inner tranquility,
[1235.52 → 1236.20] no more fighting.
[1236.20 → 1238.72] He preaches victory
[1238.72 → 1239.40] over sin.
[1241.32 → 1242.28] And ironically,
[1242.90 → 1243.56] and I'll leave this
[1243.56 → 1244.04] up to Sid,
[1244.08 → 1244.64] I don't want to preach
[1244.64 → 1245.18] on this today,
[1245.26 → 1246.54] it's too depressing,
[1246.92 → 1248.16] because Jesus says,
[1248.50 → 1248.70] no,
[1248.94 → 1250.10] there won't be an absence
[1250.10 → 1251.00] of conflict
[1251.00 → 1252.12] when I come and preach
[1252.12 → 1253.10] the good news to you,
[1253.24 → 1254.22] there will be actually
[1254.22 → 1254.70] more.
[1255.08 → 1255.58] And you,
[1255.70 → 1256.58] as my followers,
[1256.94 → 1257.82] you are actually
[1257.82 → 1258.90] going to be persecuted
[1258.90 → 1259.96] and you will have
[1259.96 → 1260.92] more conflict
[1260.92 → 1261.56] because of me.
[1261.74 → 1262.98] The world will hate you
[1262.98 → 1264.20] because they hated me first.
[1265.52 → 1266.30] Thanks, Jesus.
[1267.32 → 1268.44] And the way you're
[1268.44 → 1268.96] persecuted
[1268.96 → 1271.26] will be preached
[1271.26 → 1272.10] by Sid next week.
[1272.16 → 1272.80] I don't want to talk
[1272.80 → 1273.38] about it today.
[1274.32 → 1275.42] Very light topic
[1275.42 → 1276.18] to discuss.
[1277.86 → 1278.76] And so the peace,
[1279.16 → 1279.98] the shalom
[1279.98 → 1281.30] that Jesus preaches,
[1282.10 → 1283.14] and as I said,
[1283.14 → 1284.30] the root cause
[1284.30 → 1285.54] of all that brokenness
[1285.54 → 1286.60] is sin.
[1287.08 → 1288.02] And Jesus preaches
[1288.02 → 1289.36] shalom over
[1289.36 → 1290.92] all creation
[1290.92 → 1292.14] and all mankind.
[1293.84 → 1294.82] Jesus proclaims
[1294.82 → 1295.66] shalom and victory
[1295.66 → 1296.36] over sin
[1296.36 → 1298.20] and ultimately
[1298.20 → 1299.36] death itself.
[1300.20 → 1301.18] That's the picture
[1301.18 → 1301.58] of shalom
[1301.58 → 1302.26] that we should be
[1302.26 → 1302.90] thinking about.
[1303.40 → 1304.36] The picture of shalom
[1304.36 → 1305.42] maybe in our context
[1305.42 → 1306.02] now is
[1306.02 → 1307.04] when we face
[1307.04 → 1307.60] the problem
[1307.60 → 1308.62] with mental health
[1308.62 → 1309.10] challenges,
[1309.10 → 1310.22] when we have
[1310.22 → 1311.26] housing problems
[1311.26 → 1312.66] and people are homeless
[1312.66 → 1313.44] and they have
[1313.44 → 1314.38] no refuge,
[1314.74 → 1315.56] nowhere to go,
[1315.78 → 1316.22] when they're
[1316.22 → 1316.78] the victims
[1316.78 → 1317.98] of domestic violence,
[1318.02 → 1318.54] when there's
[1318.54 → 1319.50] so much brokenness
[1319.50 → 1320.20] in our marriages,
[1320.48 → 1321.22] in our homes,
[1321.58 → 1322.38] with drugs,
[1322.68 → 1323.26] with kids,
[1323.34 → 1325.12] even struggling
[1325.12 → 1325.96] to find their own
[1325.96 → 1326.42] identities.
[1327.32 → 1328.62] No place of refuge
[1328.62 → 1329.46] because we are
[1329.46 → 1330.12] so broken.
[1330.46 → 1331.66] Jesus says shalom
[1331.66 → 1332.82] in the face of that.
[1334.00 → 1335.94] Not just the absence
[1335.94 → 1336.78] of conflict.
[1337.24 → 1337.88] Jesus says,
[1338.26 → 1339.28] look at your hearts.
[1339.54 → 1340.44] I am pointing
[1340.44 → 1341.54] directly to
[1341.54 → 1342.74] your inner being,
[1343.22 → 1344.06] your own heart,
[1344.12 → 1345.08] the centre of your being,
[1345.08 → 1346.10] and I say shalom
[1346.10 → 1346.80] over that.
[1348.06 → 1349.36] We are all broken.
[1349.64 → 1350.52] It is not just
[1350.52 → 1351.16] our society
[1351.16 → 1351.78] and the world
[1351.78 → 1352.76] outside the church
[1352.76 → 1353.10] building
[1353.10 → 1354.38] that is all broken
[1354.38 → 1355.04] and messed up.
[1355.28 → 1356.40] We are broken
[1356.40 → 1357.02] and messed up.
[1357.34 → 1358.48] We all need
[1358.48 → 1358.86] loving
[1358.86 → 1360.42] and a merciful God.
[1361.42 → 1362.46] And we are
[1362.46 → 1364.02] in utter dependence
[1364.02 → 1364.42] of that,
[1364.50 → 1365.74] to be poor in spirit.
[1366.10 → 1366.94] That's what it means
[1366.94 → 1367.68] to be blessed.
[1367.68 → 1369.26] And Jesus says,
[1369.54 → 1370.76] shalom over that.
[1373.86 → 1375.48] This is exactly
[1375.48 → 1377.06] what the prophet Isaiah
[1377.06 → 1378.10] in the Old Testament
[1378.10 → 1380.20] was prophesying about.
[1380.48 → 1380.92] He said,
[1381.04 → 1382.14] when the Messiah comes,
[1383.20 → 1384.18] this is what
[1384.18 → 1384.94] the shalom
[1384.94 → 1385.70] will look like.
[1385.94 → 1386.92] And this is the shalom
[1386.92 → 1387.82] that he will come
[1387.82 → 1388.80] and proclaim
[1388.80 → 1389.78] and live out
[1389.78 → 1390.98] and make possible
[1390.98 → 1392.38] for his own people.
[1393.28 → 1394.00] Here's shalom.
[1394.20 → 1395.02] And I'm going to read
[1395.02 → 1396.26] these really quickly.
[1396.26 → 1397.50] They will be up
[1397.50 → 1398.58] on the screen for you.
[1398.88 → 1399.78] From Isaiah 11.
[1400.48 → 1401.64] The wolf will live
[1401.64 → 1402.38] with the lamb.
[1402.74 → 1404.20] The leopard will lie down
[1404.20 → 1404.72] with the goat
[1404.72 → 1405.98] and the calf and the lion
[1405.98 → 1406.98] and the yearling together.
[1407.34 → 1408.46] And a little child,
[1409.24 → 1409.54] Jesus,
[1409.90 → 1410.72] will lead them.
[1411.56 → 1412.46] The desert
[1412.46 → 1413.44] and the parched land
[1413.44 → 1414.36] will be glad.
[1414.60 → 1415.16] The wilderness
[1415.16 → 1416.00] will rejoice
[1416.00 → 1417.00] and blossom.
[1417.28 → 1418.24] Like the crocus,
[1418.38 → 1419.08] it will burst
[1419.08 → 1419.76] and bloom.
[1420.60 → 1421.92] It will rejoice greatly
[1421.92 → 1423.56] and shout for joy.
[1423.84 → 1424.98] The glory of Lebanon
[1424.98 → 1426.02] will be given to it.
[1426.02 → 1426.70] The splendour
[1426.70 → 1427.56] of Mount Carmel
[1427.56 → 1428.08] and Sharon.
[1428.38 → 1428.82] They will see
[1428.82 → 1429.88] the glory of the Lord.
[1430.16 → 1431.04] The splendour
[1431.04 → 1431.74] of our God.
[1431.90 → 1432.62] He's talking about
[1432.62 → 1434.70] all the geographical creation
[1434.70 → 1437.18] that he is praising from.
[1438.02 → 1440.00] Then will the eyes
[1440.00 → 1441.12] of the blind be open
[1441.12 → 1441.82] and the ears
[1441.82 → 1443.24] of the deaf unstopped.
[1443.68 → 1444.80] Then will the lame
[1444.80 → 1445.96] leap like a deer
[1445.96 → 1447.24] and the mute tongue
[1447.24 → 1448.48] shout for joy.
[1449.00 → 1450.20] Water will gush
[1450.20 → 1451.28] from forth
[1451.28 → 1451.88] in the wilderness
[1451.88 → 1452.98] and streams
[1452.98 → 1453.00] and streams
[1453.00 → 1453.96] in the desert.
[1453.96 → 1455.88] He will judge
[1455.88 → 1457.12] between the nations
[1457.12 → 1458.50] and will settle disputes
[1458.50 → 1459.42] for many peoples.
[1459.84 → 1460.52] They will beat
[1460.52 → 1461.18] their swords
[1461.18 → 1462.22] into plowshares
[1462.22 → 1463.30] and their spears
[1463.30 → 1464.38] into pruning hooks.
[1464.78 → 1465.84] Nation will not
[1465.84 → 1466.56] take up sword
[1466.56 → 1467.38] against nation
[1467.38 → 1469.14] nor will they train
[1469.14 → 1470.56] for war anymore.
[1471.32 → 1471.86] Shalom
[1471.86 → 1473.56] is what the Messiah
[1473.56 → 1474.98] will prophesy.
[1474.98 → 1477.36] And then
[1477.36 → 1478.68] in the New Testament
[1478.68 → 1480.56] Paul and John
[1480.56 → 1482.40] take that same image
[1482.40 → 1483.48] knows that
[1483.48 → 1484.32] in light of Christ
[1484.32 → 1485.82] this is fulfilled
[1485.82 → 1487.22] and it is being fulfilled
[1487.22 → 1488.32] now in their time
[1488.32 → 1488.80] of history.
[1489.20 → 1490.86] This is how they express it
[1490.86 → 1491.82] in Paul's letter
[1491.82 → 1492.60] to the Ephesians.
[1492.72 → 1493.14] He says
[1493.14 → 1494.38] Consequently
[1494.38 → 1495.98] you are no longer
[1495.98 → 1496.52] foreigners
[1496.52 → 1497.46] and strangers
[1497.46 → 1499.38] but fellow citizens
[1499.38 → 1500.62] with God's people
[1500.62 → 1502.30] and also members
[1502.30 → 1504.06] of his family.
[1504.98 → 1505.76] He says
[1505.76 → 1506.96] that's shalom.
[1508.18 → 1509.58] You have brokenness
[1509.58 → 1511.56] in your relationships
[1511.56 → 1514.40] even in your churches.
[1515.02 → 1515.64] Paul says
[1515.64 → 1516.46] no
[1516.46 → 1517.94] there are no more
[1517.94 → 1518.40] foreigners
[1518.40 → 1519.24] and strangers.
[1519.70 → 1520.88] You all belong
[1520.88 → 1522.46] to God's household.
[1523.32 → 1524.82] To God's household.
[1525.36 → 1525.64] And then
[1525.64 → 1526.64] in Revelation 21
[1526.64 → 1528.14] I feel like
[1528.14 → 1528.74] we should all have
[1528.74 → 1529.72] this memorized by now.
[1531.20 → 1532.04] He will wipe
[1532.04 → 1533.00] every tear
[1533.00 → 1533.82] from their eyes.
[1534.36 → 1534.90] There will be
[1534.90 → 1536.06] no more death
[1536.06 → 1537.28] the ultimate enemy
[1537.28 → 1537.76] of sin
[1537.76 → 1538.70] or mourning
[1538.70 → 1539.40] or crying
[1539.40 → 1539.94] or pain
[1539.94 → 1541.42] for the old order
[1541.42 → 1541.82] of things
[1541.82 → 1542.70] has passed away.
[1543.66 → 1544.02] Shalom.
[1546.30 → 1547.84] Shalom is here
[1547.84 → 1548.70] now too
[1548.70 → 1550.68] and you can taste it
[1550.68 → 1551.46] because we
[1551.46 → 1552.42] are called
[1552.42 → 1553.28] God's children
[1553.28 → 1553.78] as well
[1553.78 → 1554.84] who belong
[1554.84 → 1555.84] to his household
[1555.84 → 1557.00] who hunger
[1557.00 → 1557.96] and thirst
[1557.96 → 1559.38] for that righteousness
[1559.38 → 1561.02] for that restoration
[1561.02 → 1561.04] for that restoration
[1561.04 → 1561.20] for that restoration
[1561.20 → 1561.82] of shalom.
[1565.44 → 1566.44] That shalom
[1566.44 → 1568.38] we long for it
[1568.38 → 1569.94] we hope for it
[1569.94 → 1571.08] and we live
[1571.08 → 1571.86] for it
[1571.86 → 1573.08] in our everyday lives.
[1573.76 → 1574.58] And we are called
[1574.58 → 1575.40] God's children
[1575.40 → 1576.50] and are blessed
[1576.50 → 1577.46] to be makers
[1577.46 → 1578.52] of this shalom.
[1578.84 → 1580.10] That's our mission
[1580.10 → 1581.38] that we look at
[1581.38 → 1582.46] from this beatitude.
[1583.42 → 1584.16] Our mission
[1584.16 → 1585.22] is to be makers
[1585.22 → 1586.22] of that shalom.
[1587.02 → 1587.54] Participating
[1587.54 → 1588.02] in a mission
[1588.02 → 1589.12] that only God
[1589.12 → 1589.96] can accomplish
[1589.96 → 1591.06] and this again
[1591.06 → 1592.54] is God's mission
[1592.54 → 1593.36] not ours.
[1594.02 → 1594.82] Just so that
[1594.82 → 1595.44] we don't take
[1595.44 → 1596.26] these beatitudes
[1596.26 → 1597.20] and what it says
[1597.20 → 1598.24] in the Holy Scriptures
[1598.24 → 1599.64] as another set
[1599.64 → 1601.00] of religious rules
[1601.00 → 1601.68] and obligation
[1601.68 → 1603.40] to win God's favour
[1603.40 → 1604.54] just like the Jews
[1604.54 → 1605.14] mistook.
[1605.76 → 1606.82] They mistook
[1606.82 → 1607.38] their idea
[1607.38 → 1607.96] of the kingdom
[1607.96 → 1609.38] they also mistook
[1609.38 → 1610.56] all these religious
[1610.56 → 1611.70] obligations
[1611.70 → 1613.24] or religious rules
[1613.24 → 1614.10] that God gave us
[1614.10 → 1614.82] as guidelines
[1614.82 → 1616.02] and they took them
[1616.02 → 1617.70] as prerequisites
[1617.70 → 1619.06] to earn God's favour.
[1619.46 → 1620.20] And Jesus says
[1620.20 → 1620.66] no.
[1621.28 → 1622.34] It is when
[1622.34 → 1623.46] you are confronted
[1623.46 → 1624.58] when you are
[1624.58 → 1625.22] transformed
[1625.22 → 1626.78] by God's spirit himself
[1626.78 → 1628.18] you are given victory
[1628.18 → 1629.24] and you are given
[1629.24 → 1629.94] freedom
[1629.94 → 1631.18] to live
[1631.18 → 1632.30] in shalom.
[1633.90 → 1635.32] That's the gospel.
[1636.00 → 1637.00] Not doing all
[1637.00 → 1637.94] the meekness
[1637.94 → 1638.68] and the humility
[1638.68 → 1639.92] and all those
[1639.92 → 1641.10] good religious things
[1641.10 → 1642.14] so that we can
[1642.14 → 1642.80] be good enough.
[1643.30 → 1643.58] No.
[1643.58 → 1645.50] because of God's
[1645.50 → 1646.84] transforming spirit
[1646.84 → 1648.94] we now get to live
[1648.94 → 1650.04] get the privilege
[1650.04 → 1651.10] to live in the shalom
[1651.10 → 1652.42] and we can also
[1652.42 → 1653.34] be makers
[1653.34 → 1654.62] of that shalom
[1654.62 → 1657.02] to be partners
[1657.02 → 1657.64] with God.
[1658.32 → 1659.00] And so for us
[1659.00 → 1659.90] living in Canada
[1659.90 → 1661.48] in North America
[1661.48 → 1662.80] and turn it back
[1662.80 → 1663.72] more specifically
[1663.72 → 1664.92] in British Columbia
[1664.92 → 1665.44] Surrey
[1665.44 → 1665.90] Langley
[1665.90 → 1667.94] what does it look like
[1667.94 → 1668.86] to be peacemakers
[1668.86 → 1669.20] then
[1669.20 → 1670.10] to be partners
[1670.10 → 1670.58] with God
[1670.58 → 1671.20] in this mission?
[1672.40 → 1673.76] I have three things
[1673.76 → 1675.40] just from what I've gathered
[1675.40 → 1676.74] from witnessing
[1676.74 → 1677.48] to the scripture.
[1677.94 → 1678.22] One
[1678.22 → 1679.56] because we are
[1679.56 → 1680.48] children of God
[1680.48 → 1681.56] through God's grace
[1681.56 → 1682.42] we are adopted
[1682.42 → 1683.48] into his family
[1683.48 → 1684.58] as it says in Ephesians
[1684.58 → 1686.02] and when we belong
[1686.02 → 1687.28] to his household
[1687.28 → 1689.28] there is some sort of
[1689.28 → 1690.06] not some sort of
[1690.06 → 1691.56] there is a beautiful
[1691.56 → 1692.22] sense
[1692.22 → 1693.34] of confidence
[1693.34 → 1694.32] and stability
[1694.32 → 1696.46] that can only come
[1696.46 → 1697.80] from our perfect
[1697.80 → 1698.68] loving
[1698.68 → 1699.60] Father God.
[1701.36 → 1702.36] And I talked about
[1702.36 → 1703.06] my firstborn
[1703.06 → 1703.92] thinking about
[1703.92 → 1704.82] my second born now
[1704.82 → 1705.16] Timothy
[1705.16 → 1705.72] who is only
[1705.72 → 1706.68] about one now
[1706.68 → 1708.48] he has this weird
[1708.48 → 1709.04] confidence
[1709.04 → 1710.52] like all young babies do
[1710.52 → 1712.84] where he feels like
[1712.84 → 1713.46] he can do whatever
[1713.46 → 1714.04] he wants
[1714.04 → 1715.38] whether it be
[1715.38 → 1716.16] poking his finger
[1716.16 → 1717.44] into an electrical hole
[1717.44 → 1719.26] we didn't let him do that
[1719.26 → 1719.72] I'm just saying
[1719.72 → 1720.38] as an example
[1720.38 → 1721.36] whether it be
[1721.36 → 1722.96] poking into an electrical hole
[1722.96 → 1723.94] or trying to
[1723.94 → 1725.72] reach for the knives
[1725.72 → 1726.58] that are in the dishwasher
[1726.58 → 1728.82] they have this weird
[1728.82 → 1730.36] confidence and stability
[1730.36 → 1731.02] that they can do
[1731.02 → 1731.70] whatever they want
[1731.70 → 1734.00] and it made me think
[1734.00 → 1734.84] where does that
[1734.84 → 1735.82] confidence come from?
[1737.10 → 1737.58] And yes
[1737.58 → 1738.38] I said this in the
[1738.38 → 1739.12] first service
[1739.12 → 1739.74] I don't know if
[1739.74 → 1740.56] Moon got mad at me
[1740.56 → 1742.12] it's kind of borderline
[1742.12 → 1743.12] between stupidity
[1743.12 → 1743.76] and confidence
[1743.76 → 1745.06] there's a thin line
[1745.06 → 1745.72] there I think
[1745.72 → 1747.02] but
[1747.02 → 1749.02] even being innocent
[1749.02 → 1749.88] let's not use
[1749.88 → 1750.78] the word stupid here
[1750.78 → 1752.38] even being innocent
[1752.38 → 1753.44] and having that
[1753.44 → 1754.48] confidence and stability
[1754.48 → 1756.58] it comes because
[1756.58 → 1758.48] Timothy has
[1758.48 → 1759.64] and has no choice
[1759.64 → 1760.02] actually
[1760.02 → 1760.74] but to have
[1760.74 → 1761.56] full dependence
[1761.56 → 1762.54] and trust
[1762.54 → 1763.66] on his parents
[1763.66 → 1765.14] he knows that
[1765.14 → 1765.88] whatever he does
[1765.88 → 1767.02] somebody will come
[1767.02 → 1767.90] and cover for him
[1767.90 → 1770.30] and that same
[1770.30 → 1771.08] confidence
[1771.08 → 1772.50] radiates
[1772.50 → 1773.36] and oozes
[1773.36 → 1774.48] out of our lives
[1774.48 → 1774.92] as well
[1774.92 → 1776.38] when we enjoy
[1776.38 → 1777.56] shalom relationship
[1777.56 → 1779.10] with our own
[1779.10 → 1779.54] father
[1779.54 → 1780.74] our heavenly father
[1780.74 → 1783.68] and this sense
[1783.68 → 1784.34] of peace
[1784.34 → 1785.52] and shalom
[1785.52 → 1787.04] even when the world
[1787.04 → 1788.32] throws all sorts
[1788.32 → 1789.20] of turmoil
[1789.20 → 1790.46] and brokenness
[1790.46 → 1791.00] and chaos
[1791.00 → 1791.90] in all of our
[1791.90 → 1792.48] relationships
[1792.48 → 1793.26] and I want to say
[1793.26 → 1794.64] all of our relationships
[1794.64 → 1796.18] no matter how good
[1796.18 → 1797.16] your relationships are
[1797.16 → 1798.18] there is always
[1798.18 → 1798.94] some sort of
[1798.94 → 1800.24] brokenness
[1800.24 → 1801.48] deep inside
[1801.48 → 1802.68] and sometimes
[1802.68 → 1803.92] we ourselves
[1803.92 → 1804.76] are the cause
[1804.76 → 1805.26] of that
[1805.26 → 1807.88] when we enjoy
[1807.88 → 1808.64] shalom relationship
[1808.64 → 1809.24] with God
[1809.24 → 1810.42] the difference though
[1810.42 → 1810.76] is
[1810.76 → 1811.50] even though
[1811.50 → 1812.32] we are broken
[1812.32 → 1813.34] even though
[1813.34 → 1814.74] we are in the world
[1814.74 → 1815.86] and we do live here
[1815.86 → 1816.82] in Surrey and Langley
[1816.82 → 1817.60] in the midst
[1817.60 → 1818.74] of all brokenness
[1818.74 → 1819.68] we are not
[1819.68 → 1820.80] of the world
[1820.80 → 1821.44] because we don't
[1821.44 → 1822.14] identify
[1822.14 → 1823.58] and say that the world
[1823.58 → 1824.60] is what defines
[1824.60 → 1825.50] our identity
[1825.50 → 1827.62] God defines
[1827.62 → 1828.30] our identity
[1828.30 → 1829.48] that's where
[1829.48 → 1830.48] we are rooted
[1830.48 → 1832.24] and this rootedness
[1832.24 → 1834.08] is very contagious
[1834.08 → 1836.30] and it is very noticeable
[1836.30 → 1838.80] and so take this one story
[1838.80 → 1839.30] from I got
[1839.30 → 1840.10] from I
[1840.10 → 1841.72] from Caden
[1841.72 → 1843.10] who I got this story from
[1843.10 → 1844.18] is what I want to say
[1844.18 → 1845.76] Caden sitting right there
[1845.76 → 1847.26] is one of our young adults
[1847.26 → 1848.30] our new young adults
[1848.30 → 1849.70] and new person of faith
[1849.70 → 1851.58] and he landed a job
[1851.58 → 1852.92] at a new construction company
[1852.92 → 1854.20] and while being
[1854.20 → 1855.38] very, very grateful
[1855.38 → 1856.30] for his new job
[1856.30 → 1857.22] and he's doing very well
[1857.22 → 1857.84] for himself
[1857.84 → 1859.24] construction
[1859.24 → 1860.42] as many of you know
[1860.42 → 1861.82] is not the most
[1861.82 → 1862.74] friendly environment
[1862.74 → 1863.76] for people of faith
[1863.76 → 1866.84] but Caden shared with me
[1866.84 → 1868.36] a story of joy
[1868.36 → 1869.54] when he found
[1869.54 → 1870.26] and met
[1870.26 → 1872.00] another person of faith
[1872.00 → 1874.80] albeit on a construction site
[1874.80 → 1876.98] and when he met him
[1876.98 → 1878.26] that other person
[1878.26 → 1879.94] not having known him
[1879.94 → 1880.80] at all in the past
[1880.80 → 1882.16] and not having had
[1882.16 → 1883.52] any extended conversation
[1883.52 → 1884.78] Caden felt this
[1884.78 → 1886.84] weird different vibe
[1886.84 → 1887.72] from this person
[1887.72 → 1889.26] and then after
[1889.26 → 1890.94] a little while
[1890.94 → 1892.66] Caden ended up asking
[1892.66 → 1896.60] Caden ended up asking
[1896.60 → 1897.26] this person
[1897.26 → 1899.34] are you a man of God
[1899.34 → 1901.30] and that's the exact
[1901.30 → 1902.12] quote that I got
[1902.12 → 1902.50] from Caden
[1902.50 → 1903.74] are you a man of God
[1903.74 → 1905.54] Caden felt something
[1905.54 → 1907.64] and sure enough
[1907.64 → 1908.64] this person
[1908.64 → 1909.90] was a man of faith
[1909.90 → 1911.68] and he was overjoyed
[1911.68 → 1912.34] and encouraged
[1912.34 → 1913.80] to have another brother
[1913.80 → 1915.00] that can
[1915.00 → 1917.14] share in that shalom
[1917.14 → 1917.92] that he has
[1917.92 → 1919.58] even if he hasn't been
[1919.58 → 1920.46] to church in a while
[1920.46 → 1921.92] even if he may be
[1921.92 → 1923.18] struggling in his faith
[1923.18 → 1925.04] so encouraging
[1925.04 → 1926.72] and that stability
[1926.72 → 1927.54] and confidence
[1927.54 → 1928.16] that he had
[1928.16 → 1930.04] in that shalom relationship
[1930.04 → 1930.88] he enjoys
[1930.88 → 1933.56] because and thanks to
[1933.56 → 1934.82] God's grace
[1934.82 → 1936.58] and God's loving ways
[1936.58 → 1937.32] through his spirit
[1937.32 → 1941.18] we are peacemakers
[1941.18 → 1943.50] as we enjoy
[1943.50 → 1944.30] peace
[1944.30 → 1945.48] with God himself
[1945.48 → 1947.00] and it radiates
[1947.00 → 1948.14] you are light
[1948.14 → 1948.82] for the world
[1948.82 → 1949.36] second
[1949.36 → 1950.76] just like Jesus
[1950.76 → 1951.68] who totally flipped
[1951.68 → 1952.24] the world view
[1952.24 → 1952.84] and perspective
[1952.84 → 1953.76] of the Romans
[1953.76 → 1954.26] and the Jews
[1954.26 → 1954.86] of his time
[1954.86 → 1955.92] who thought of peace
[1955.92 → 1957.20] in their own certain way
[1957.20 → 1958.24] Jesus says
[1958.24 → 1958.58] nope
[1958.58 → 1959.96] I'm flipping that around
[1959.96 → 1961.02] that is not shalom
[1961.02 → 1961.90] shalom
[1961.90 → 1963.18] is self
[1963.18 → 1964.46] sacrificial love
[1964.46 → 1966.40] that's the second point
[1966.40 → 1967.52] what does it mean
[1967.52 → 1968.38] to be peacemakers
[1968.38 → 1970.80] we reflect Christ likeness
[1970.80 → 1971.88] when we reflect
[1971.88 → 1973.68] self sacrificial love
[1973.68 → 1974.82] just like Jesus himself
[1974.82 → 1976.46] and to emphasize this point
[1976.46 → 1977.28] I just copied
[1977.28 → 1978.32] and pasted Mike's
[1978.32 → 1978.80] beatitude
[1978.80 → 1979.86] that he made for us
[1979.86 → 1980.42] last week
[1980.42 → 1982.28] and his beatitude
[1982.28 → 1982.88] from last week
[1982.88 → 1983.40] says this
[1983.40 → 1985.08] in a world of selfishness
[1985.08 → 1986.24] narcissism
[1986.24 → 1987.70] and self-centredness
[1987.70 → 1988.92] all the selfies
[1988.92 → 1989.46] that we take
[1989.46 → 1989.82] he said
[1989.82 → 1992.22] blessed are the selfless
[1992.22 → 1994.76] who live in self-giving love
[1994.76 → 1995.76] looking out
[1995.76 → 1996.38] for the interest
[1996.38 → 1997.00] of others
[1997.00 → 1997.90] above themselves
[1997.90 → 1999.66] for they shall be satisfied
[1999.66 → 2001.98] that is a contemporary
[2001.98 → 2003.02] beatitude
[2003.02 → 2003.66] a blessing
[2003.66 → 2004.74] that Mike wrote
[2004.74 → 2005.38] for us
[2005.38 → 2007.16] would Jesus say that
[2007.16 → 2007.96] if you were alive
[2007.96 → 2008.68] here right now
[2008.68 → 2009.60] and saying that to us
[2009.60 → 2011.66] I think so
[2011.66 → 2012.74] and I think Jesus
[2012.74 → 2013.98] did speak through Mike
[2013.98 → 2016.74] and then he gave us homework
[2016.74 → 2017.72] he said
[2017.72 → 2018.80] make your own beatitudes
[2018.80 → 2020.12] in your own context
[2020.12 → 2021.02] what's a beatitude
[2021.02 → 2022.10] that you would think of
[2022.10 → 2024.40] so as being a good student
[2024.40 → 2026.10] I made my own beatitude
[2026.10 → 2027.24] and I said this
[2027.24 → 2028.32] based on 1 Corinthians
[2028.32 → 2029.72] in a world of
[2029.72 → 2031.10] instant gratification
[2031.10 → 2033.98] instant gratification
[2033.98 → 2035.40] and minimal room
[2035.40 → 2036.00] for patience
[2036.00 → 2038.48] which leads to us
[2038.48 → 2039.40] defining love
[2039.40 → 2040.24] in this way as well
[2040.24 → 2041.38] love means
[2041.38 → 2042.86] instant gratification
[2042.86 → 2044.70] that's what I want
[2044.70 → 2045.86] all I'm thinking about
[2045.86 → 2046.40] is myself
[2046.40 → 2048.78] so in a world of that
[2048.78 → 2050.20] in a world of instant gratification
[2050.20 → 2050.90] and minimal room
[2050.90 → 2051.56] for patience
[2051.56 → 2052.80] blessed are those
[2052.80 → 2053.48] who define
[2053.48 → 2054.94] and live lovingly
[2054.94 → 2056.82] in patience
[2056.82 → 2057.80] kindness
[2057.80 → 2059.30] not being envious
[2059.30 → 2060.32] not being proud
[2060.32 → 2061.54] not dishonouring
[2061.54 → 2062.72] or self-seeking
[2062.72 → 2064.90] not easily angered
[2065.70 → 2066.78] he struggled with that one
[2066.78 → 2068.60] rejoices with the truth
[2068.60 → 2069.90] with the truth
[2069.90 → 2070.86] with Jesus
[2070.86 → 2071.88] who is truth
[2071.88 → 2072.90] with his scripture
[2073.54 → 2074.40] the word
[2074.40 → 2075.96] as he has gifted us with
[2075.96 → 2077.82] rejoicing with that
[2077.82 → 2079.32] always protecting
[2079.32 → 2080.16] trusting
[2080.16 → 2080.76] hoping
[2080.76 → 2081.70] and persevering
[2081.70 → 2082.28] in our faith
[2082.28 → 2083.66] blessed is the one
[2083.66 → 2084.50] who loves
[2084.50 → 2085.58] a godly
[2085.58 → 2086.94] Christ-like
[2086.94 → 2088.70] self-sacrificial love
[2088.70 → 2090.28] for that love
[2090.28 → 2091.60] never fails
[2091.60 → 2093.56] if we have
[2093.56 → 2094.46] this kind of love
[2094.46 → 2095.70] and every one of his
[2095.70 → 2097.24] every one of God's children
[2097.24 → 2098.06] reflected this
[2098.06 → 2100.24] I think it's safe to say
[2100.24 → 2101.46] we don't need laws anymore
[2101.46 → 2103.02] if that were the case
[2103.02 → 2108.68] that's hungering
[2108.68 → 2109.66] and thirsting
[2109.66 → 2110.32] for shalom
[2110.32 → 2111.36] for righteousness
[2111.36 → 2112.26] in our lives
[2112.26 → 2113.26] to be
[2113.26 → 2114.82] self-sacrificial
[2114.82 → 2115.72] just like Christ
[2115.72 → 2117.86] and lastly
[2117.86 → 2118.92] from Jesus himself
[2118.92 → 2121.54] not to just
[2121.54 → 2122.52] love our neighbours
[2122.52 → 2123.82] because this challenge
[2123.82 → 2124.44] and this mission
[2124.44 → 2125.30] to be peacemakers
[2125.30 → 2126.46] it might be easy
[2126.46 → 2127.10] in your home
[2127.10 → 2128.40] maybe some of you not
[2128.40 → 2129.62] but many of us
[2129.62 → 2130.22] we can say
[2130.22 → 2130.96] sometimes
[2130.96 → 2131.96] most of the time
[2131.96 → 2133.22] it's easy to love
[2133.22 → 2134.16] my own son Joseph
[2134.16 → 2135.16] or my wife
[2135.16 → 2136.48] or Timothy
[2136.48 → 2140.54] but Jesus challenges us
[2140.54 → 2141.30] further than that
[2141.30 → 2141.90] because he's getting
[2141.90 → 2142.44] to the heart
[2142.44 → 2142.88] of the issue
[2142.88 → 2143.32] isn't he
[2143.32 → 2144.50] he's saying
[2144.50 → 2145.74] don't just love
[2145.74 → 2146.40] your neighbours
[2146.40 → 2147.38] whoever agrees
[2147.38 → 2147.94] with you
[2147.94 → 2149.30] but love
[2149.30 → 2150.30] your enemies
[2150.30 → 2151.30] as we looked at
[2151.30 → 2151.74] at the beginning
[2151.74 → 2152.24] of the sermon
[2152.24 → 2154.26] love your enemies
[2154.26 → 2157.92] I'll let Jesus
[2157.92 → 2158.76] speak for himself
[2158.76 → 2159.76] you have heard
[2159.76 → 2160.40] that it was said
[2160.40 → 2161.16] Matthew 5
[2161.16 → 2162.84] love your neighbour
[2162.84 → 2164.22] and hate your enemy
[2164.22 → 2165.76] that's from scripture
[2165.76 → 2167.04] but Jesus says
[2167.04 → 2168.06] getting to the heart of it
[2168.06 → 2169.14] but I tell you
[2169.14 → 2170.50] love your enemies
[2170.50 → 2172.00] and pray for those
[2172.00 → 2173.00] who persecute you
[2173.00 → 2174.04] that you may be
[2174.04 → 2174.88] children of your
[2174.88 → 2175.62] father in heaven
[2175.62 → 2177.78] he causes the sun
[2177.78 → 2178.88] to rise on the evil
[2178.88 → 2179.70] and the good
[2179.70 → 2180.66] and sends rain
[2180.66 → 2181.20] on the righteous
[2181.20 → 2182.40] and the unrighteous
[2182.40 → 2183.80] if you love those
[2183.80 → 2184.58] who love you
[2184.58 → 2185.80] what reward
[2185.80 → 2186.58] will you get
[2186.58 → 2187.94] are not even
[2187.94 → 2188.96] the tax collectors
[2188.96 → 2189.56] doing that
[2189.56 → 2190.08] the sinners
[2190.08 → 2192.12] and if you greet
[2192.12 → 2193.32] only your own
[2193.32 → 2193.88] people
[2193.88 → 2196.18] your own
[2196.18 → 2196.74] people
[2196.74 → 2198.70] whether it be
[2198.70 → 2199.38] of your own
[2199.38 → 2199.88] ethnicity
[2199.88 → 2201.06] whether it be
[2201.06 → 2201.78] of your own
[2201.78 → 2202.42] household
[2202.42 → 2203.24] whether it be
[2203.24 → 2203.78] your own
[2203.78 → 2204.20] church
[2204.20 → 2204.90] whether it be
[2204.90 → 2205.32] your own
[2205.32 → 2205.96] denomination
[2205.96 → 2207.14] however small
[2207.14 → 2208.06] your circle is
[2208.06 → 2209.00] your own
[2209.00 → 2209.46] people
[2209.46 → 2210.36] if you only
[2210.36 → 2211.30] greet them
[2211.30 → 2214.10] doesn't the world
[2214.10 → 2214.86] do that
[2214.86 → 2216.12] doesn't our society
[2216.12 → 2216.76] do that
[2216.76 → 2218.56] doesn't our society
[2218.56 → 2219.78] do a better job
[2219.78 → 2220.16] of that
[2220.16 → 2220.62] sometimes
[2220.62 → 2221.28] than we do
[2221.28 → 2221.84] as Christians
[2221.84 → 2224.24] and Jesus
[2224.24 → 2225.52] is challenging us
[2225.52 → 2226.54] getting to the heart
[2226.54 → 2227.12] of the issue
[2227.12 → 2229.02] love your enemies
[2229.02 → 2231.76] love people
[2231.76 → 2232.68] that are not
[2232.68 → 2233.92] your own people
[2233.92 → 2235.76] the Gentiles
[2235.76 → 2238.08] and then he
[2238.08 → 2239.12] and then he
[2239.12 → 2239.70] caps it off
[2239.70 → 2240.12] with this
[2240.12 → 2241.58] be perfect
[2241.58 → 2243.18] for your heavenly
[2243.18 → 2244.26] father is perfect
[2244.26 → 2245.32] wow
[2245.32 → 2246.08] thanks Jesus
[2246.08 → 2246.98] that's easier
[2246.98 → 2247.82] that's easier
[2247.82 → 2248.48] said than done
[2248.48 → 2250.12] be perfect
[2250.12 → 2251.56] as your father
[2251.56 → 2251.98] in heaven
[2251.98 → 2252.58] is perfect
[2252.58 → 2255.56] in light of our
[2255.56 → 2256.28] beatitude today
[2256.28 → 2257.62] what does that
[2257.62 → 2258.22] sound like
[2258.22 → 2259.50] Jesus is
[2259.50 → 2260.34] challenging us
[2260.34 → 2261.00] he's saying
[2261.00 → 2262.08] be shalom
[2262.08 → 2262.60] makers
[2262.60 → 2264.40] just as our heavenly
[2264.40 → 2264.84] father
[2264.84 → 2266.12] is shalom
[2266.12 → 2266.76] itself
[2266.76 → 2269.46] that's our
[2269.46 → 2269.98] mission
[2269.98 → 2271.70] be blessed
[2271.70 → 2272.92] to be a blessing
[2272.92 → 2274.46] be shalom
[2274.46 → 2274.92] makers
[2274.92 → 2275.76] be perfect
[2275.76 → 2278.00] to be
[2278.00 → 2279.16] shalom
[2279.16 → 2279.82] for the world
[2279.82 → 2282.84] you radiate it
[2282.84 → 2283.98] you live it
[2283.98 → 2285.88] people can see it
[2285.88 → 2287.42] it's very contagious
[2287.42 → 2289.02] but people
[2289.02 → 2290.18] for the most part
[2290.18 → 2290.90] don't know
[2290.90 → 2291.48] where that peace
[2291.48 → 2292.10] come from
[2292.10 → 2294.94] are you out
[2294.94 → 2295.78] there radiating
[2295.78 → 2296.06] that
[2296.06 → 2296.56] yes
[2296.56 → 2298.06] are you out
[2298.06 → 2298.58] there then
[2298.58 → 2299.54] guiding people
[2299.54 → 2300.54] to see that
[2300.54 → 2300.82] light
[2300.82 → 2301.72] and the source
[2301.72 → 2302.32] of where that
[2302.32 → 2302.80] light
[2302.80 → 2303.58] and that shalom
[2303.58 → 2304.24] comes from
[2304.24 → 2307.82] we come to
[2307.82 → 2308.26] God
[2308.26 → 2309.02] and we come
[2309.02 → 2309.54] to Jesus
[2309.54 → 2310.18] who is
[2310.18 → 2310.78] who called
[2310.78 → 2311.18] himself
[2311.18 → 2311.96] and proclaims
[2311.96 → 2312.40] the scripture
[2312.40 → 2313.62] that he is
[2313.62 → 2314.26] the light
[2314.26 → 2314.82] of the world
[2314.82 → 2316.64] and we bring
[2316.64 → 2317.16] and our mission
[2317.16 → 2317.64] is to bring

[2320.16 → 2321.30] through everything
[2321.30 → 2322.08] that we live
[2322.08 → 2322.60] through
[2322.60 → 2323.84] we are
[2323.84 → 2325.76] shalom makers
[2325.76 → 2326.48] even in our
[2326.48 → 2327.08] brokenness
[2327.08 → 2328.28] may that be
[2328.28 → 2329.52] an encouragement
[2329.52 → 2330.74] may that be
[2330.74 → 2331.42] a reminder
[2331.42 → 2332.38] of your identities
[2332.38 → 2333.78] as we live our
[2333.78 → 2334.26] to be this
[2334.26 → 2335.10] light for the world

[2359.18 → 2359.52] of
[2359.52 → 2361.04] shalom making
[2361.04 → 2361.94] we cannot do it
[2361.94 → 2362.50] on our own
[2362.50 → 2365.18] sometimes we even
[2365.18 → 2366.38] stand against it
[2366.38 → 2367.10] and lord
[2367.10 → 2368.14] we ask for your

[2384.24 → 2385.36] radiate that light
[2385.36 → 2387.00] wherever we are
[2387.00 → 2387.62] in our work

[2390.26 → 2391.32] in our households
[2391.32 → 2395.08] may we radiate
