[0.00 → 10.20] Well, it's always tough to preach after Joe prays.
[11.10 → 14.02] Thank you, Joe, for leading us in community prayer.
[16.50 → 21.16] For the last number of weeks, we have been looking at what we call the Songs of Luke.
[21.90 → 28.26] Now, the Songs of Luke are basically the moments in the story where God reveals his plan of sending Jesus.
[28.26 → 33.26] And those who he reveals that plan to break out into song.
[33.36 → 34.72] They break out into celebration.
[34.90 → 39.40] We've looked at the Song of Mary, at the Song of Zechariah, at the Song of Simeon.
[39.54 → 43.64] And this morning, this evening, we are going to be looking at the Angel's Song.
[44.28 → 47.70] And so I'm going to read for us well-known words from the Gospel of Luke.
[47.76 → 52.56] This is Luke chapter 2 about the birth of Jesus and the announcement made to the shepherds.
[52.56 → 60.90] And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over the flocks at night.
[61.64 → 67.20] An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
[68.06 → 69.24] But the angel said to them,
[69.24 → 94.28] Suddenly, a great company of heavenly hosts appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
[94.28 → 100.82] Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favour rests.
[101.98 → 105.56] When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another,
[105.86 → 109.90] Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.
[110.74 → 115.08] So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger.
[116.34 → 120.78] When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told to them about this child.
[120.78 → 124.38] And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
[125.16 → 128.52] But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
[129.22 → 134.04] The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen,
[134.50 → 136.74] which they were just as they had been told.
[141.68 → 145.08] Now, I don't know what goes through your mind when you hear this passage read,
[145.08 → 151.68] but I will admit that often when I read it, the image that pops into my head is of a children's Christmas pageant.
[152.12 → 153.04] Am I the only one?
[153.50 → 156.94] The shepherds and the manger and all that's happening, the flocks.
[157.38 → 162.06] And maybe the reason I think that is because just two years ago, you might remember this,
[162.10 → 166.34] in our church we had our cornerstone children do a Christmas pageant here on the stage.
[166.78 → 170.50] And if you don't remember it, let me remind you, that was the year, right at the end of COVID,
[170.50 → 174.26] where our little flock of sheep, the children three years old, my daughter was one of them,
[174.74 → 176.50] they were exposed to COVID.
[177.12 → 181.40] And then all of a sudden there was contact tracing, and it was no longer a silent night at Hope Community Church.
[182.52 → 184.28] That's why I remember that Christmas pageant.
[185.20 → 189.90] And as much as I love Christmas pageants, there is one possible drawback to them.
[190.52 → 195.16] And that is that they could sometimes present a cute and quaint picture of the nativity scene.
[195.50 → 198.50] And that just isn't what Luke is telling us about in this passage.
[198.50 → 205.24] In fact, maybe this will burst your bubble, but the story of Luke chapter 2 is a dangerous story.
[206.34 → 211.78] The birth of Jesus could not have taken place at a more turbulent and violent and dangerous time.
[212.30 → 217.02] There were riots going on between the Jewish people and the Roman occupiers at the time.
[217.46 → 218.72] There was street danger.
[218.84 → 220.50] People couldn't go out at night in safety.
[220.64 → 222.90] That's the context Jesus was born into.
[222.90 → 229.48] And Luke wants his readers to know, even by the way he talks through this story, that it's not a safe time.
[230.54 → 234.26] In fact, the question Luke puts before his readers, I'm quite certain of,
[234.64 → 236.96] is the question that you have to make a decision between.
[237.14 → 243.78] There are two kings who claim to be savers of the world, who claim to bring peace on earth.
[243.78 → 246.64] And they are competing for allegiance from people.
[246.76 → 249.68] One is the Caesar, and the other is Jesus Christ.
[251.08 → 257.24] When Luke starts telling the birth of Jesus, you might remember from many different movies or different stories,
[257.30 → 259.26] he starts by saying, in the days of whom?
[260.10 → 266.36] In the days of Caesar Augustus, who initiates the census that actually starts a lot of these riots.
[266.48 → 269.40] Now, Caesar Augustus is an important part of the story.
[269.40 → 272.44] And you should know, just a little bit of backstory on Caesar,
[272.68 → 276.32] he had a very interesting title that he wanted people to refer to him by,
[276.42 → 277.22] and this is the title.
[277.68 → 278.30] You're going to love it.
[279.08 → 283.84] He referred to himself as the benefactor and the saviour of the whole world.
[284.52 → 287.22] And when I read that, I just think, hashtag narcissist, right?
[287.68 → 288.86] It's hard not to think so.
[288.92 → 293.42] And you should know that Caesar Augustus actually instituted the worship of himself.
[293.62 → 296.92] People would come, and they'd pay homage to him, and they'd worship him as a deity.
[296.92 → 300.86] There were many writings at the time, and I'm going to read for you just one of them,
[300.98 → 304.04] that sort of paid homage to Caesar as a god and as a saviour.
[304.18 → 304.72] Listen to this.
[304.78 → 308.88] This comes from the decree of the provincial assembly in 9 AD.
[308.88 → 335.28] Now, just take a close look at that.
[335.28 → 337.10] Can you see what Luke is trying to do?
[338.22 → 342.18] Luke should be read as sort of treasonous words against Augustus,
[342.22 → 344.26] where he's saying there's actually a different king,
[344.54 → 348.56] born in a different place to this obscure couple in Bethlehem.
[348.78 → 353.40] And about that king, angels are saying he is the saviour of the world,
[353.66 → 355.60] who's bringing peace to his earth.
[356.66 → 358.88] And Luke is forcing people to ask,
[358.88 → 361.64] who's the saviour who's bringing peace?
[361.90 → 364.06] Is it Caesar or is it Jesus?
[365.64 → 368.52] Now, we've noticed throughout this series, if you've been with us,
[368.72 → 371.80] that every time the announcement is made that Jesus is coming,
[372.32 → 374.32] the announcement is made to all the wrong people.
[374.92 → 378.16] It's made first to a poor Jewish young woman, that's Mary.
[378.46 → 381.66] Then it's made to two senior citizens, that's Zechariah and Simeon.
[381.66 → 387.02] And our story tells the story of the announcement of Jesus' birth being made to shepherds.
[387.80 → 391.84] And I have a hunch that the shepherds were just as surprised as anyone else
[391.84 → 393.18] that they're part of the plot.
[393.34 → 393.84] Here's why.
[394.64 → 396.56] Shepherds in the first century were not dignified.
[397.38 → 399.10] Their job was a low-income job.
[399.22 → 400.54] People looked down on shepherds.
[400.84 → 402.56] They were known to be untrustworthy,
[402.76 → 404.46] and sometimes they were known for being thieves.
[404.96 → 407.12] And so, generally speaking, they were looked down on.
[407.12 → 412.34] And yet, here's a group of shepherds in a field in the middle of the night,
[412.50 → 416.50] and the glory of the Lord shines around them.
[418.20 → 420.36] I quite like this image for many reasons.
[420.94 → 422.40] I think it shows their surprise,
[422.44 → 425.00] because they were stunned that this was their experience.
[425.68 → 428.14] And like so many of the appearances from angels to humans,
[428.26 → 429.20] the shepherds are terrified.
[429.38 → 430.60] And what does the angel say to them?
[430.94 → 432.58] Do not be afraid.
[433.02 → 436.76] I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all people.
[437.12 → 440.32] Today, in the town of David, a Saviour has been born.
[440.82 → 443.24] He is the Messiah, the Lord.
[444.00 → 447.56] And remember, these words from the angels are spoken to shepherds
[447.56 → 449.14] who already believe there is a Saviour,
[449.30 → 451.50] who are already told that Caesar was the Saviour,
[451.90 → 453.48] bringing peace to his world.
[454.82 → 457.16] And if this scene isn't marvellous enough,
[457.36 → 459.48] I mean, just imagine, they see one angel
[459.48 → 461.18] who tells them not to be afraid,
[461.26 → 463.46] and then they look up, and they see what is a company,
[463.46 → 466.76] a heavenly host of angels appearing to them.
[467.54 → 469.38] And what we need to remind ourselves is,
[469.46 → 471.46] at this time, very few people knew
[471.46 → 473.70] of anything that was happening with the birth of Jesus.
[474.28 → 475.40] But you know who did know?
[476.84 → 477.86] The angels knew.
[478.64 → 479.82] And the angels, as it were,
[479.90 → 483.16] they show up to celebrate what is coming,
[483.24 → 484.42] what God is doing,
[484.46 → 485.94] because they know the significance,
[486.60 → 488.30] they know what's going to change,
[488.40 → 489.86] they know where history is moving,
[489.86 → 492.64] and so they show up to bring the praise to God
[492.64 → 494.82] for what he is doing in the sending of Jesus.
[496.10 → 498.50] And the angel song, as it's commonly referred to,
[498.54 → 500.64] is the one that's produced many of the songs we have sung tonight,
[501.10 → 503.14] some of the songs we are still going to sing tonight.
[503.48 → 505.22] And it's this short little song
[505.22 → 506.96] where they say,
[507.20 → 508.88] glory to God in the highest heaven,
[509.64 → 513.82] and on earth peace to those on whom his favour rests.
[514.70 → 516.18] This song is about two things.
[516.52 → 517.32] It's about glory,
[518.00 → 519.24] and it is about peace.
[520.08 → 521.66] And you should know that word peace there
[521.66 → 523.02] is one of those big words.
[523.34 → 525.86] You know, when Western people use the word peace,
[525.94 → 527.88] we often think of inner tranquility
[527.88 → 529.32] or inner sense of at peace.
[529.74 → 531.36] But when we talk about peace in the Bible,
[531.46 → 534.08] it's this big sense of being put back together.
[534.46 → 536.94] It's a sense of creation coming back into harmony.
[536.94 → 540.80] It's a sense of total, whole, complete harmony.
[541.80 → 544.24] And one of the big promises God makes throughout the Bible
[544.24 → 546.00] is to bring peace.
[546.58 → 549.06] In fact, a tiny summary of the Bible
[549.06 → 550.84] is that the Bible starts with peace.
[551.18 → 552.66] Harmony between God and humans,
[553.08 → 554.70] harmony between humans and one another,
[555.18 → 556.64] harmony between humans and creation,
[556.76 → 558.26] and even harmony within ourselves.
[558.72 → 559.50] There was peace.
[560.12 → 563.26] There wasn't disharmony until humans rebelled against God,
[563.36 → 564.70] saying, we'll take it from here.
[564.70 → 566.64] And then there's this fracturing
[566.64 → 568.24] between our relationship with God,
[568.62 → 569.62] relationship with one another,
[569.88 → 570.74] relationship with creation,
[570.88 → 572.00] and even with ourselves.
[572.76 → 574.78] But the promise from that point in the story
[574.78 → 576.54] right up until the end of the Bible
[576.54 → 579.96] is that God is going to bring peace.
[581.04 → 583.90] In fact, there's this audacious prophecy in Isaiah 9
[583.90 → 587.14] where Isaiah says, a child is going to be born.
[587.80 → 589.32] And the titles given to this child,
[589.42 → 590.24] some of you may know them,
[590.66 → 593.48] are Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God,
[593.48 → 597.48] Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace.
[597.52 → 599.04] I heard it from one of our kids in the front.
[599.84 → 601.26] And that child, says Isaiah,
[601.30 → 602.46] is going to govern the world
[602.46 → 603.88] and bring healing and renewal
[603.88 → 605.44] and peace to his creation.
[606.08 → 608.24] And the angels and Luke
[608.24 → 609.86] in telling the story of Jesus' birth
[609.86 → 611.82] are saying quite boldly, audaciously,
[612.18 → 614.28] that child has come.
[615.22 → 617.14] That child was born in Bethlehem,
[617.14 → 620.30] and he is going to be the Prince of Peace.
[621.10 → 621.84] Contra Caesar.
[622.54 → 624.16] Contra all those who have come before him
[624.16 → 624.98] to make this claim.
[627.02 → 628.56] Now, if you didn't grow up in the church
[628.56 → 631.20] and you're not familiar with the story of the Bible,
[631.88 → 634.58] it would be a very appropriate question to ask,
[635.12 → 637.34] how in the world does this child
[637.34 → 638.86] born in a feeding trough
[638.86 → 640.70] go about bringing peace?
[641.18 → 642.66] Like, what is this child going to do
[642.66 → 645.82] that's going to accomplish peace in this world?
[646.68 → 648.12] And the New Testament writers, by the way,
[648.14 → 649.48] are so delighted you asked.
[649.64 → 650.84] They spent so much of their time
[650.84 → 652.28] answering this question for us.
[653.32 → 654.64] The Gospel writers, of course,
[654.70 → 656.82] are quick to show how Jesus, as he grows,
[657.16 → 658.80] as he performs his earthly ministry,
[659.14 → 660.48] he brings peace, right?
[660.54 → 661.74] He forgives sins of people.
[661.84 → 663.02] He restores their hearts.
[663.26 → 665.12] He brings healing to their bodies
[665.12 → 666.38] that are diseased and riddled
[666.38 → 667.52] with all sorts of temptation.
[667.52 → 670.66] He calms the storm just by extending his hand,
[670.74 → 671.94] bringing peace to his creation.
[672.76 → 675.70] But ultimately, and climactically,
[676.14 → 678.14] the moment that all the Bible writers
[678.14 → 680.78] want to tell us about is the cross.
[681.64 → 683.90] That's the place of peace.
[684.78 → 685.78] In fact, I want to read for you
[685.78 → 687.36] one of my favourite passages in the Bible.
[687.64 → 688.92] It comes from Colossians,
[689.18 → 691.26] where Paul is giving this celebration
[691.26 → 692.58] about the power of God,
[692.62 → 694.18] and this is what Paul writes about Jesus.
[694.18 → 699.16] For God was pleased to have all his fullness
[699.16 → 700.34] dwell in him,
[700.66 → 702.86] and through him to reconcile to himself
[702.86 → 705.04] all things, whether things on earth
[705.04 → 705.94] or things in heaven,
[706.02 → 709.28] by making peace through his blood
[709.28 → 711.60] shed on the cross.
[713.24 → 716.40] Jesus did not come to storm the palace.
[716.94 → 717.92] Many people thought he would.
[718.52 → 720.08] Jesus did not come to sort of stir up
[720.08 → 721.42] a band of rebels who were going to grab
[721.42 → 723.42] their swords and try to attack the Caesar
[723.42 → 725.08] and take hold of their land back.
[725.32 → 726.66] That's not what Jesus came to do.
[727.32 → 728.82] He came to bring peace
[728.82 → 732.24] by healing the rupture between heaven and earth,
[732.40 → 733.58] between people and others,
[733.68 → 735.44] between nations and other nations,
[736.00 → 738.90] by giving up his life selflessly
[738.90 → 741.86] and sacrificially in the cross.
[742.86 → 746.68] That is the moment where peace came to earth.
[746.68 → 750.42] Now I want to tell you a story
[750.42 → 752.02] about Napoleon Bonaparte.
[752.40 → 754.94] I noticed that a movie just came out about him.
[755.66 → 756.94] Napoleon is a French emperor
[756.94 → 758.62] who ruled for a very short period of time,
[759.30 → 761.78] from 1804 to 1815.
[762.44 → 765.40] He conquered 16 nations in short succession.
[765.54 → 767.06] This guy was hugely ambitious,
[767.26 → 768.78] considered by many people
[768.78 → 770.52] to be one of the most brilliant
[770.52 → 772.50] military strategists of all time.
[773.10 → 774.62] But Napoleon, just like so many people
[774.62 → 776.04] before him and after him,
[776.40 → 777.06] so ambitious,
[777.26 → 778.30] wanted to conquer the world,
[778.40 → 779.54] wanted to create his own kingdom,
[779.66 → 781.02] he extended himself too far,
[781.28 → 782.26] he lost a war,
[782.38 → 784.26] and was banished to an island to die.
[784.36 → 785.00] It's a tough life.
[785.92 → 787.12] Before his death,
[787.62 → 789.16] these were some of his reflections
[789.16 → 790.96] on empires and on war
[790.96 → 792.36] and how to build an empire.
[792.50 → 793.30] This is what he writes.
[795.10 → 796.78] Alexander, that's Alexander the Great,
[797.14 → 798.12] Caesar Augustus,
[798.12 → 800.44] and Charlemagne, and me,
[801.02 → 802.50] all founded empires.
[802.50 → 805.08] But what foundation did we rest
[805.08 → 806.80] the creation of our genius
[806.80 → 808.84] upon force?
[810.32 → 813.24] Jesus Christ founded an empire upon love,
[813.92 → 814.68] and at this hour,
[814.84 → 816.20] millions of men and women
[816.20 → 817.82] would die for him.
[818.30 → 819.02] And I just want to add,
[819.12 → 820.14] millions of men and women
[820.14 → 821.96] continue in the name of Christ
[821.96 → 823.18] to be persecuted and killed
[823.18 → 824.06] for what they believe.
[825.72 → 827.42] Do you see what he's wrestling with there?
[828.12 → 829.26] There's a way that people
[829.26 → 830.60] go about establishing peace.
[830.60 → 831.74] There's a way that we go about
[831.74 → 832.98] building empires as humans,
[833.18 → 834.92] and Jesus doesn't fit the mould.
[835.38 → 837.08] And right before his own death,
[837.18 → 837.96] Napoleon's like,
[838.26 → 840.02] there's one person I can think of
[840.02 → 842.26] who establishes peace differently,
[842.34 → 843.30] and it's Jesus Christ
[843.30 → 845.54] in his death and in his resurrection.
[847.18 → 849.10] Do you know what the first thing Jesus says
[849.10 → 851.56] to his disciples after his resurrection?
[853.06 → 853.96] They're in a room.
[854.10 → 855.38] They're afraid for their lives.
[855.46 → 857.14] They just had the guts to follow Jesus.
[857.26 → 858.38] They didn't see the cross coming.
[858.38 → 860.18] They're huddled for fear of their own lives.
[860.24 → 861.28] And Jesus appears to them.
[861.52 → 863.14] The first thing Jesus says to them
[863.14 → 864.18] in Luke chapter 24
[864.18 → 865.68] is,
[865.84 → 866.62] peace be with you.
[867.68 → 868.56] It's the first thing he says
[868.56 → 869.62] to his fearful disciples.
[870.20 → 871.36] And it's Jesus' way of saying,
[871.66 → 873.00] the reconciling work
[873.00 → 874.24] between heaven and on earth
[874.24 → 875.28] has been finished.
[876.04 → 877.66] The work that I came to do,
[877.76 → 878.64] I have accomplished.
[878.94 → 879.76] Sin has been dealt with.
[880.04 → 880.94] Death has been defeated.
[881.24 → 882.50] I now rise to you
[882.50 → 883.60] in resurrection life.
[883.60 → 884.88] And that life,
[885.82 → 886.58] that peace,
[887.06 → 888.06] is yours.
[889.36 → 890.30] And from that moment
[890.30 → 892.16] throughout the history since then,
[892.58 → 894.28] as millions of men and women
[894.28 → 895.26] and old and young
[895.26 → 896.36] have put their faith in Jesus,
[896.48 → 897.42] they have experienced
[897.42 → 898.74] his peace.
[899.50 → 899.84] In fact,
[899.92 → 901.10] just after the 10 a.m. service
[901.10 → 901.50] this morning,
[901.60 → 902.44] someone came up to me,
[902.52 → 903.88] someone who gave their lives
[903.88 → 904.68] to Christ recently,
[904.82 → 905.06] said,
[905.36 → 906.42] that's exactly why
[906.42 → 907.44] they became a Christian.
[907.84 → 909.58] It's because the peace of Christ
[909.58 → 910.96] was what they are looking for.
[910.96 → 912.30] And it's the peace of Christ
[912.30 → 913.06] that brought order
[913.06 → 914.60] and joy and restoration
[914.60 → 915.46] to their family,
[915.54 → 916.02] their relationships,
[916.20 → 916.92] and their self.
[919.16 → 920.24] Now there are two things
[920.24 → 921.06] I want to spend the rest
[921.06 → 922.12] of my time teasing out.
[922.24 → 922.46] Don't worry,
[922.50 → 923.44] I'm not going to take too long.
[924.50 → 925.86] The first thing is this,
[926.30 → 927.30] that Jesus Christ,
[927.44 → 928.36] the Saviour of the world
[928.36 → 929.52] that the angels announce,
[930.26 → 931.58] is a king for everybody.
[932.50 → 934.08] He is a king for everybody.
[934.24 → 936.44] It is not an insignificant detail
[936.44 → 938.42] that the angels announce
[938.42 → 940.24] this good news to shepherds.
[940.96 → 942.78] To the disrespectful outsiders
[942.78 → 943.44] of society,
[943.66 → 944.70] to the people who knew nothing
[944.70 → 945.32] about the power
[945.32 → 945.80] and the privilege
[945.80 → 946.84] of the palace in Rome.
[947.28 → 948.58] It's not a little detail
[948.58 → 949.78] because what that shows
[949.78 → 952.40] is the heart of God.
[953.02 → 954.04] I mean, don't miss this.
[954.62 → 956.18] God sends Jesus
[956.18 → 958.68] for the shepherds.
[959.46 → 960.36] He reveals himself
[960.36 → 961.12] to the elderly
[961.12 → 961.84] and to Mary,
[961.94 → 963.00] this poor Jewish teenager,
[963.10 → 963.60] and to shepherds
[963.60 → 964.96] because they are seen
[965.48 → 966.52] by the Father.
[966.98 → 968.50] And Jesus is sent
[968.50 → 969.94] for them.
[969.94 → 971.46] He came to bring
[971.46 → 972.06] His shalom,
[972.20 → 972.82] His wholeness,
[972.86 → 973.60] and His restoration
[973.60 → 975.06] to the tax collectors,
[975.54 → 976.42] to the fishermen,
[976.84 → 978.56] to those who understood power,
[978.62 → 979.90] and to those who didn't feel
[979.90 → 980.60] like they belonged,
[980.70 → 981.44] the shepherds.
[982.06 → 983.58] The shepherds belong
[983.58 → 984.90] in the salvation
[984.90 → 986.24] of Jesus.
[987.40 → 988.52] And I often wondered,
[988.58 → 989.14] even this week
[989.14 → 990.34] as I prepared this message,
[990.78 → 992.40] what would it have been like
[992.40 → 994.00] for these shepherds
[994.00 → 995.12] to hear the news
[995.12 → 995.78] from these angels,
[996.00 → 997.38] to go then to Bethlehem
[997.38 → 998.74] to witness Jesus
[998.74 → 1000.02] with their own eyes
[1000.02 → 1001.54] and think to themselves,
[1001.74 → 1002.70] could this be
[1002.70 → 1004.86] a king for the people?
[1005.76 → 1006.90] Could this be a king
[1006.90 → 1008.38] who finally loves
[1008.38 → 1010.18] those on the outside?
[1010.66 → 1011.72] A king who sees
[1011.72 → 1012.96] and wants to bring restoration
[1012.96 → 1014.32] to those who are not significant
[1014.32 → 1015.28] in the Roman Empire?
[1015.56 → 1017.02] Could this be a king for them?
[1017.06 → 1017.94] And the answer is,
[1018.52 → 1019.08] yes.
[1019.90 → 1021.52] This is a Saviour
[1021.52 → 1022.98] for the wealthy
[1022.98 → 1023.84] and the poor,
[1024.26 → 1025.70] for those who have
[1025.70 → 1026.24] what they need
[1026.24 → 1027.40] and those who do not,
[1027.66 → 1028.52] for the strong
[1028.52 → 1029.12] and the weak,
[1029.20 → 1029.82] for the old
[1029.82 → 1030.76] and the young.
[1031.70 → 1033.16] Jesus is for all of us.
[1033.56 → 1034.24] He is the one
[1034.24 → 1035.06] who will bring peace
[1035.06 → 1037.18] to all who will receive Him.
[1038.46 → 1039.78] And I think there's a moment
[1039.78 → 1040.92] in all of our lives,
[1042.04 → 1043.30] whether you are someone
[1043.30 → 1044.16] who believes in Jesus
[1044.16 → 1044.90] or doesn't,
[1045.48 → 1046.86] where we're looking for peace,
[1047.02 → 1048.12] and I'll speak on behalf
[1048.12 → 1049.40] of those who believe in Jesus,
[1049.96 → 1051.08] that we often look back
[1051.08 → 1052.60] at the meandering mess
[1052.60 → 1053.32] of our lives,
[1053.88 → 1054.92] those pieces of our lives
[1054.92 → 1055.96] that we're ashamed of,
[1056.08 → 1056.84] those parts of our lives
[1056.84 → 1057.78] we wish did not happen
[1057.78 → 1058.48] the way they do,
[1058.84 → 1060.74] and we look at the person of Jesus
[1060.74 → 1061.56] and we say,
[1062.42 → 1062.74] wow,
[1063.90 → 1065.14] He came from me.
[1066.82 → 1068.38] He came to bring wholeness
[1068.38 → 1070.02] and restoration to this person
[1070.02 → 1071.96] in this family system,
[1072.30 → 1073.74] in this broken scenario,
[1074.08 → 1075.08] with all the stuff
[1075.08 → 1076.16] we'd rather not talk about
[1076.16 → 1076.90] in this life,
[1077.02 → 1078.70] He's the King for me.
[1079.52 → 1080.32] Praise the Lord.
[1081.78 → 1082.76] Jesus is the King
[1082.76 → 1083.38] and the Saviour
[1083.38 → 1085.16] who has come to bring peace
[1085.16 → 1086.40] to all who would receive Him.
[1086.68 → 1087.52] That's the first thing.
[1088.08 → 1088.82] The second thing
[1088.82 → 1089.66] I want to highlight
[1089.66 → 1091.00] is that the shepherds
[1091.00 → 1091.92] had to make a decision,
[1092.52 → 1093.76] as do all of us.
[1094.42 → 1094.74] Remember,
[1094.86 → 1095.84] the shepherds heard the news
[1095.84 → 1096.82] about a Saviour coming
[1096.82 → 1098.06] who was bringing peace,
[1098.52 → 1099.82] thinking that there was already
[1099.82 → 1101.10] a person claiming it, right?
[1101.30 → 1102.12] Caesar Augustus,
[1102.48 → 1103.42] Saviour of the world,
[1103.92 → 1105.22] benefactor of all people
[1105.22 → 1106.38] who restored peace
[1106.38 → 1106.90] and order
[1106.90 → 1108.12] to the whole world.
[1108.78 → 1109.96] They had to make
[1109.96 → 1111.46] the journey over to Bethlehem
[1111.46 → 1112.66] and then they had to wrestle
[1112.66 → 1113.48] with the claim
[1113.48 → 1114.40] the angels made.
[1115.00 → 1116.22] Is Jesus
[1116.22 → 1117.80] that person?
[1118.64 → 1120.78] Is Jesus truly the King
[1120.78 → 1122.02] for all the people?
[1122.12 → 1123.28] Has He come to bring peace
[1123.28 → 1123.90] to all people?
[1124.16 → 1125.04] And you know what's interesting?
[1125.88 → 1126.98] It's not just that the shepherds
[1126.98 → 1128.30] got to behold God
[1128.30 → 1128.94] in the manger
[1128.94 → 1130.38] in the person of Jesus.
[1131.18 → 1132.46] It's what they did afterwards.
[1132.60 → 1133.36] You know what they did next?
[1134.50 → 1135.48] Verse 17 and following.
[1135.54 → 1136.24] What did the shepherds do?
[1136.48 → 1137.50] They go from Bethlehem
[1137.50 → 1138.32] where they witnessed Jesus
[1138.32 → 1138.76] in the manger
[1138.76 → 1140.18] and they spread the good news.
[1140.68 → 1141.68] They tell the people
[1141.68 → 1142.24] in the towns
[1142.24 → 1142.78] of what they heard
[1142.78 → 1143.42] and what they saw.
[1143.76 → 1145.88] They go glorifying God
[1145.88 → 1147.16] and sharing
[1147.16 → 1149.28] about whom this King Jesus is
[1149.28 → 1150.54] and what was told to them
[1150.54 → 1151.16] by the angels.
[1152.50 → 1153.56] One writer put it this way.
[1153.64 → 1153.84] They said,
[1153.84 → 1154.52] you know the shepherds,
[1154.60 → 1155.26] they get an angel.
[1156.38 → 1157.70] Everybody else gets a shepherd.
[1158.72 → 1159.56] All the other people
[1159.56 → 1160.60] who hear about Jesus
[1160.60 → 1161.50] and what has been born
[1161.50 → 1162.04] in Bethlehem,
[1162.12 → 1163.94] they hear it from the shepherds,
[1164.54 → 1165.64] from the ordinary folk.
[1166.50 → 1167.26] But the shepherds
[1167.26 → 1168.10] had to make a decision.
[1168.22 → 1169.64] Is Caesar the Lord
[1169.64 → 1171.12] bringing salvation and peace
[1171.12 → 1171.92] or is it Jesus?
[1172.68 → 1173.40] And their worship
[1173.40 → 1174.50] and the sharing
[1174.50 → 1175.24] of what they heard
[1175.24 → 1176.70] suggests they bought in.
[1177.30 → 1178.20] They believed
[1178.20 → 1179.16] and they became messengers
[1179.16 → 1179.96] of the good news.
[1181.46 → 1182.58] And I want to suggest to you
[1182.58 → 1183.68] that everyone who reads
[1183.68 → 1185.14] these dangerous words
[1185.14 → 1185.86] of Luke 2
[1185.86 → 1187.66] has to make that same decision.
[1187.92 → 1188.64] Yes, we don't live
[1188.64 → 1189.08] in an era
[1189.08 → 1190.76] where there is a Caesar Augustus
[1190.76 → 1191.54] claiming to be
[1191.54 → 1193.58] the saviour of the whole world.
[1194.42 → 1195.58] But in every generation,
[1195.80 → 1196.94] there are the saviours,
[1197.04 → 1197.62] you might say.
[1198.26 → 1198.86] There are the things
[1198.86 → 1199.52] that we worship,
[1199.78 → 1200.46] the things that we give
[1200.46 → 1201.08] our praise to,
[1201.14 → 1201.86] the things that we place
[1201.86 → 1202.74] our hope in,
[1202.96 → 1204.60] that we desperately want
[1204.60 → 1205.72] to bring us peace.
[1206.54 → 1207.50] And I would suggest
[1207.50 → 1208.64] that if you live in Canada,
[1209.44 → 1210.60] the saviour of the world
[1210.60 → 1210.98] is who?
[1212.12 → 1212.94] It's the self.
[1214.18 → 1215.06] It's me who's going
[1215.06 → 1215.96] to solve my life.
[1216.88 → 1218.66] And the saviour that is the self
[1218.66 → 1219.74] is going to find meaning
[1219.74 → 1221.00] and satisfaction and peace
[1221.00 → 1222.48] often through material prosperity,
[1222.74 → 1222.98] right?
[1223.20 → 1224.10] The rich are the winners
[1224.10 → 1225.06] in Western society.
[1225.52 → 1226.06] And I would say
[1226.06 → 1226.84] at this time of year,
[1226.92 → 1227.86] you know the way we find
[1227.86 → 1229.00] our meaning and our peace
[1229.00 → 1229.84] and our satisfaction?
[1231.56 → 1231.92] Consumption.
[1233.28 → 1234.16] Buying stuff.
[1234.56 → 1234.86] In fact,
[1234.92 → 1235.70] there's an economist
[1235.70 → 1236.76] in 1955,
[1236.76 → 1238.14] his name is Victor Leno,
[1238.26 → 1238.60] who said,
[1238.92 → 1239.60] what we need to do
[1239.60 → 1240.26] is teach people
[1240.26 → 1241.20] to find not just
[1241.20 → 1243.20] general economic satisfaction
[1243.20 → 1243.82] in purchasing,
[1244.08 → 1246.16] but spiritual satisfaction
[1246.16 → 1247.30] in purchasing.
[1248.50 → 1249.12] And I wonder
[1249.12 → 1250.36] if Luke 2 were written today,
[1250.78 → 1251.90] how might he go after
[1251.90 → 1253.24] the gods of self
[1253.24 → 1254.30] and the gods
[1254.30 → 1255.44] of material prosperity
[1255.44 → 1256.74] and consumption?
[1258.80 → 1259.50] Tim Keller,
[1259.82 → 1260.74] in his own life
[1260.74 → 1261.28] and ministry,
[1261.94 → 1262.60] he wrote this,
[1262.64 → 1263.44] and I'm going to read it twice
[1263.44 → 1264.16] because it hits me
[1264.16 → 1264.78] between the eyes
[1264.78 → 1265.48] and I think you'll find
[1265.48 → 1266.40] the challenge there too.
[1266.40 → 1267.14] He writes,
[1267.54 → 1268.46] accepting Jesus
[1268.46 → 1269.76] requires humility
[1269.76 → 1273.32] because it requires
[1273.32 → 1273.94] that we admit
[1273.94 → 1275.98] that we cannot save ourselves
[1275.98 → 1277.56] by our own means.
[1277.64 → 1278.08] Can I say that
[1278.08 → 1278.64] one more time?
[1279.22 → 1279.98] Accepting Jesus
[1279.98 → 1281.10] requires humility
[1281.10 → 1283.44] because we need to admit
[1283.44 → 1285.76] that we cannot save ourselves
[1285.76 → 1287.46] by our own means.
[1288.12 → 1289.00] And it requires,
[1289.20 → 1290.06] might I suggest,
[1290.74 → 1292.44] the humility of a shepherd
[1292.44 → 1294.06] to receive Christ.
[1294.06 → 1294.56] Christ.
[1294.86 → 1296.46] It requires recognizing
[1296.46 → 1297.66] that we have needs
[1297.66 → 1298.78] and that this king
[1298.78 → 1299.76] born in humility
[1299.76 → 1300.56] and fragility
[1300.56 → 1301.56] and obscurity
[1301.56 → 1303.02] is the one who's come
[1303.02 → 1303.86] to bring our healing,
[1304.28 → 1304.80] our salvation,
[1304.80 → 1306.02] and our peace.
[1306.02 → 1308.66] I want to finish
[1308.66 → 1309.12] with a quote
[1309.12 → 1309.98] from a former teacher
[1309.98 → 1310.28] of mine.
[1310.34 → 1311.24] His name is Daryl Johnson.
[1312.24 → 1313.26] Daryl Johnson recounts
[1313.26 → 1314.36] the story of a conversation
[1314.36 → 1315.40] between two very well-known
[1315.40 → 1316.04] Bible teachers.
[1316.14 → 1317.24] One is Thomas Torrance
[1317.24 → 1317.74] and the other one
[1317.74 → 1318.48] is Karl Barth.
[1319.10 → 1319.98] And Thomas Torrance
[1319.98 → 1321.16] in a conversation with Barth
[1321.16 → 1321.98] asked him the question,
[1322.04 → 1322.38] he said,
[1322.58 → 1323.84] when in the story
[1323.84 → 1324.42] of Jesus
[1324.42 → 1325.66] did you know
[1325.66 → 1326.30] that the world
[1326.30 → 1327.50] is going to be saved?
[1328.50 → 1329.42] And Karl Barth
[1329.42 → 1330.22] gave him a very
[1330.22 → 1332.46] perhaps expected answer.
[1332.58 → 1332.94] He said,
[1333.06 → 1334.10] it's Good Friday for me.
[1334.56 → 1335.36] So when Jesus died
[1335.36 → 1336.12] on the cross
[1336.12 → 1337.20] and he defeated
[1337.20 → 1337.94] the power of sin,
[1338.02 → 1338.60] that I knew
[1338.60 → 1339.20] that the world
[1339.20 → 1340.22] was going to be saved.
[1340.68 → 1341.50] And then he turns
[1341.50 → 1342.56] and he asked Thomas Torrance
[1342.56 → 1343.16] the same question,
[1343.24 → 1343.80] when in the story
[1343.80 → 1344.14] of Jesus
[1344.14 → 1344.96] did you know
[1344.96 → 1345.64] that the world
[1345.64 → 1346.62] was going to be saved?
[1347.48 → 1348.62] And Torrance said to him,
[1348.82 → 1349.76] it's Christmas Eve.
[1350.78 → 1351.88] Jesus being born
[1351.88 → 1352.52] into the world,
[1352.60 → 1353.58] that's when I knew
[1353.58 → 1355.38] the world would be saved.
[1356.48 → 1357.26] And Daryl Johnson,
[1357.26 → 1358.02] my former teacher,
[1358.14 → 1358.32] he said,
[1358.38 → 1358.54] you know,
[1358.58 → 1359.36] if I were asked
[1359.36 → 1359.90] the question,
[1360.24 → 1361.54] when in the Jesus story
[1361.54 → 1362.50] did I know
[1362.50 → 1363.12] that the world
[1363.12 → 1364.06] was going to be saved?
[1364.12 → 1365.04] I would answer,
[1365.84 → 1366.52] it's the moment
[1366.52 → 1367.32] he was conceived
[1367.32 → 1368.22] in Mary's womb.
[1368.88 → 1369.42] And I'll read
[1369.42 → 1370.24] what he says next.
[1371.32 → 1372.32] It's at that moment
[1372.32 → 1372.98] that humanity
[1372.98 → 1373.82] and divinity
[1373.82 → 1374.80] are united
[1374.80 → 1375.92] in a single cell.
[1376.94 → 1378.18] And from that moment on,
[1378.26 → 1380.28] there is no turning back.
[1380.78 → 1381.80] How are we going
[1381.80 → 1382.82] to separate humanity
[1382.82 → 1384.10] from divinity now?
[1384.82 → 1385.94] That's what draws me
[1385.94 → 1386.46] to Christmas
[1386.46 → 1387.24] because we know
[1387.24 → 1388.12] at that moment,
[1388.36 → 1389.64] on that night,
[1390.00 → 1391.74] all will be well.
[1392.06 → 1393.62] There is no turning back.
[1394.10 → 1394.98] God is going
[1394.98 → 1396.16] to have his way
[1396.16 → 1397.54] with his world.
[1398.96 → 1400.22] Glory to God
[1400.22 → 1400.98] in the highest
[1400.98 → 1403.36] and peace on earth
[1403.36 → 1404.40] to those on whom
[1404.40 → 1405.40] his favour rests.
[1406.20 → 1406.52] Amen.
[1407.38 → 1408.54] Would you pray with me?
[1408.54 → 1413.42] Father, we thank you
[1413.42 → 1414.30] for your word
[1414.30 → 1416.04] and we thank you
[1416.04 → 1417.16] for the word made flesh.
[1418.16 → 1418.96] We thank you
[1418.96 → 1419.62] that your love
[1419.62 → 1420.46] for your world
[1420.46 → 1422.10] and your creation
[1422.10 → 1423.02] and for us
[1423.02 → 1423.98] was so great
[1423.98 → 1425.48] that you sent
[1425.48 → 1426.36] Jesus Christ,
[1427.36 → 1428.58] humanity and deity,
[1429.40 → 1430.80] to save us.
[1430.80 → 1431.80] God bless you.
[1431.80 → 1433.08] We thank you
[1433.08 → 1433.80] that true peace
[1433.80 → 1434.56] comes in him
[1434.56 → 1435.74] and that day
[1435.74 → 1436.38] is coming
[1436.38 → 1437.70] where Christ
[1437.70 → 1438.32] is returning
[1438.32 → 1439.48] in glory and power.
[1440.60 → 1441.54] The day our tears
[1441.54 → 1442.36] will be wiped away,
[1443.14 → 1444.44] our bodies healed,
[1445.42 → 1446.14] our creation
[1446.14 → 1447.22] made perfect again.
[1447.22 → 1449.22] We thank you
[1449.22 → 1450.24] that that is secure
[1450.24 → 1451.20] in Jesus Christ.
