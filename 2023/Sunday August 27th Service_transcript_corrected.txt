[0.00 → 12.60] This morning I have the privilege of continuing our little sort of miniseries where we get to look at the story.
[13.86 → 20.56] And last week Dave guided us through the central good news, the gospel story.
[20.88 → 29.70] And this morning what I want to do is invite you to take a step back with me and to see why that central gospel story is so central.
[30.00 → 36.36] It's so significant and so meaningful in the midst of the broader biblical story.
[37.00 → 45.50] And so this morning we get to journey from the very beginning, from Genesis 1 all the way to Revelation 21, which is the whole Bible.
[45.64 → 47.42] So I hope you have your patience with you today.
[47.42 → 51.36] We'll need a little bit of patience as we go through the story.
[52.28 → 58.42] But, not but, and I say grad narrative, and we look at the bigger story.
[58.42 → 58.98] Story.
[59.46 → 67.92] Because, I say, and I suggest that the Bible is not just some sort of religious book or some sort of collection of moral codes and rules.
[68.54 → 69.60] It's a story.
[70.58 → 77.08] There may be a mix of genres and the way the story is told may be odd and different at times.
[77.64 → 79.36] But it really is a story.
[79.36 → 84.80] And it's a story about something that happened in real history with real people in real places.
[85.36 → 91.42] And it's also a story that claims the beginning and the end of the whole entire universe.
[91.94 → 94.86] It's being, it's existence, and it's meaning.
[96.10 → 98.78] And so you can see the story of the Bible on the board.
[99.04 → 104.88] If you take Surge, you have the task of being able to tell the full story in two minutes.
[104.88 → 106.60] I don't have to do that today.
[106.90 → 109.52] One, I haven't taken Surge yet, so I don't have that excuse.
[110.04 → 116.42] And two, I actually have a more expanded time when we get to explore what the Bible story means for us.
[116.92 → 125.22] And so, as I prepared for this sermon, my old middle school math teacher came up to my mind.
[125.58 → 130.54] And I remember her saying, I don't know why it came up during our math class of all classes,
[130.54 → 137.92] but I remember her saying something like this, even if you're not a Christian, the Bible is a fascinating book.
[138.40 → 140.42] It's a good story to read.
[140.92 → 143.18] And that's what she said when I was in middle school.
[143.92 → 145.68] And that gave me two things.
[146.06 → 154.56] One, it encouraged me very much because in the public school setting that I was in, the story was not about the Bible.
[154.80 → 155.98] It was not very friendly.
[155.98 → 162.38] And the stories and the narratives that shaped my middle school puberty life was very much not biblical.
[162.90 → 169.94] And so, one, when my teacher, my math teacher, mentioned the Bible and kind of semi-promoted it.
[169.98 → 171.90] I know you're not supposed to do that in public schools.
[172.20 → 177.90] But when she said that the Bible is a good story to read, it encouraged me in my young journey of faith
[177.90 → 182.62] and also provided for me a new way to look at the Bible.
[183.54 → 190.36] Because I grew up a pastor's kid and I grew up in the church, read the Bible somewhat a lot all throughout my life,
[190.58 → 191.96] even in my formative years.
[192.30 → 196.60] But then when she said, when my math teacher said that it's a good story to read,
[196.90 → 201.04] I thought to myself, huh, that is a different way to look at the Bible.
[201.82 → 205.38] Because I don't know if anybody else can relate with me growing up in the church.
[205.38 → 209.54] For me growing up, I had a very simplistic view of the Bible, actually.
[210.14 → 215.70] In my mind, the Bible was just one of many religious books that offered one, again,
[215.78 → 221.98] of many different options of going to heaven, some sort of afterlife paradise when I died.
[223.14 → 228.60] The way to, quote-unquote, achieve this goal was obviously through a person named Jesus.
[228.76 → 230.30] You can't take Jesus out of the Bible.
[230.64 → 232.10] So that part was obvious enough.
[232.10 → 235.86] But the way to achieve the goal of going to heaven, right?
[236.24 → 237.18] False idea there, too.
[237.52 → 246.10] Going to heaven and punch my ticket to be good enough was to believe in this man who died for me 2,000 years ago,
[246.24 → 248.76] even though I didn't ask him to die for me.
[249.02 → 252.42] And I didn't even know why he died for me in the first place.
[252.42 → 261.28] And so, just a religious book, a collection of rules, some sort of rules that define my identity as a Christian, as a religious person.
[262.12 → 265.20] And Jesus was sort of like the centre of it, or it was supposed to be.
[265.36 → 267.40] And I had to devote my whole life to him.
[267.40 → 273.26] And so, the way I'm describing it right now, the way I grew up thinking about our Bible,
[273.76 → 279.92] is very much, I think, in line with what Pastor Dave mentioned last week,
[280.22 → 285.74] the moralistic, therapeutic deism that is kind of the shaping culture today.
[286.74 → 292.70] Moralistic, therapeutic deism, where Jesus is very insignificant in this view.
[293.40 → 297.68] Jesus was not very significant in my life, other than when we had kind of youth retreat,
[297.88 → 300.00] turn off the lights, play loud music, get emotional.
[300.16 → 302.00] Oh, right, Jesus is very important.
[302.32 → 303.24] I can feel it.
[303.54 → 307.04] But then when I really thought about the Bible, it's like, oh, right.
[307.62 → 309.06] Oh, I shouldn't smoke.
[309.18 → 310.10] Oh, I shouldn't drink.
[310.18 → 310.92] Oh, I shouldn't swear.
[311.06 → 312.62] Oh, because I'm a Christian, right?
[312.66 → 313.24] It's a religion.
[313.70 → 315.08] It's a collection of rules.
[316.44 → 320.90] And then as I grew, and then as I was formed in the gospel story,
[320.90 → 325.72] when I take, when we take the religion out of Christianity
[325.72 → 331.68] and truly try to view the Bible as a story that explains the existence of the whole world
[331.68 → 335.52] and ourselves in it, it is something different.
[336.98 → 341.04] And this is a long segue into me trying to emphasize that our Christian faith,
[341.36 → 344.68] our faith which is founded on the story of the Bible,
[345.04 → 348.02] is true and is good news for us.
[348.02 → 350.80] We all belong in this story,
[351.12 → 355.36] and we are all characters in this very much non-fiction,
[355.96 → 360.88] sometimes chaotic, adventurous, joyful, sad, maybe scary at times.
[361.14 → 364.56] And most of all, this story that provides us with hope,
[364.88 → 366.64] it is a hopeful story.
[367.12 → 369.84] And that hope is founded on Jesus.
[370.14 → 372.58] And Jesus is everything in this story,
[373.16 → 374.22] as we heard last week.
[374.22 → 378.10] And so as we see the Bible as the true story for the world,
[378.90 → 382.70] Jesus is not just a sideline character who we're supposed to live for or something.
[383.02 → 384.28] Jesus is everything.
[385.02 → 387.06] Jesus is the centre of the story.
[388.08 → 390.18] And to emphasize this point just a little further,
[390.36 → 392.74] here's what a Hindu scholar had to say about our Bible.
[394.18 → 394.82] He says,
[394.82 → 397.00] I can't understand why you missionaries,
[397.10 → 398.24] why you Christian missionaries,
[398.54 → 402.24] present this Bible to us in India as a book of religion.
[402.88 → 404.38] It is not a book of religion.
[404.54 → 406.52] And anyway, we have plenty of books in India.
[407.10 → 408.48] We don't need any more.
[409.32 → 412.10] What I find in your Bible is a unique interpretation
[412.10 → 414.84] of the history of the whole of creation
[414.84 → 417.00] and the history of the human race.
[417.38 → 421.62] And therefore, a unique interpretation of the human person,
[422.04 → 423.32] and I thought this was very key,
[423.32 → 426.16] the unique interpretation of the human person
[426.16 → 428.44] as a responsible actor,
[428.86 → 431.20] responsible actor in history.
[432.04 → 433.08] That is unique.
[433.84 → 438.16] There is nothing else in the whole religious literature of the world
[438.16 → 439.50] to put alongside it.
[439.82 → 440.20] End quote.
[441.28 → 442.54] So it's a story.
[443.24 → 444.64] Not just a religious book.
[444.70 → 445.32] It's a story.
[445.70 → 447.08] A unique interpretation.
[447.78 → 449.62] And we are responsible actors.
[449.62 → 450.94] Why?
[451.40 → 454.14] Because we are all made in the image of God.
[454.26 → 455.34] And we will look at it further.
[455.76 → 458.90] And so where better to begin this story than the beginning?
[459.52 → 460.32] Genesis 1.
[460.52 → 462.22] So Genesis 1 to Revelation 1.
[462.30 → 462.70] Strap in.
[463.26 → 464.64] This is the beginning of the story.
[465.46 → 466.14] As we all know,
[466.46 → 467.26] in the beginning,
[467.76 → 470.36] God created the heavens and the earth.
[470.36 → 473.84] And now the earth was formless and empty.
[474.54 → 476.86] Darkness was over the surface of the deep.
[477.26 → 478.58] And the Spirit of God,
[479.16 → 480.14] God's Spirit,
[480.52 → 482.24] was hovering over the waters.
[483.96 → 486.58] And so from the beginning of this grand narrative,
[486.76 → 487.54] this big story,
[488.00 → 490.80] we see God as the main character.
[491.80 → 493.30] And He begins the story.
[493.40 → 494.36] And not only that,
[494.76 → 497.62] He is the author of the story as well.
[497.62 → 500.72] He speaks the world into being.
[501.40 → 503.28] He speaks and it happens.
[503.46 → 504.72] And what that teaches us,
[504.82 → 506.40] right from the beginning of this story,
[506.74 → 507.76] is that God,
[507.92 → 509.10] in theological terms,
[509.48 → 510.58] is sovereign.
[511.32 → 513.26] God is in full control.
[513.46 → 515.62] What He says comes into being.
[517.44 → 520.64] The biblical story then tells us that our God,
[520.70 → 521.90] it goes on to tell us,
[521.94 → 522.44] I should say,
[522.90 → 523.88] that our God,
[524.00 → 525.52] that's described in the Bible,
[525.52 → 526.52] is good,
[527.20 → 527.94] He's caring,
[528.40 → 529.38] He's detailed,
[529.94 → 530.96] He is creative,
[531.78 → 532.22] and again,
[532.34 → 533.12] He is sovereign.
[533.46 → 534.58] He's in full control.
[535.92 → 537.66] And as God created the world,
[537.80 → 539.96] He saw that the world He created
[539.96 → 541.64] was also good.
[542.68 → 544.30] He saw that it was beautiful,
[544.60 → 545.02] creative,
[545.30 → 545.66] diverse,
[545.96 → 546.92] it was flourishing,
[547.06 → 547.86] it was growing.
[548.34 → 551.20] And it's the image of a blessed world.
[551.58 → 553.78] And God called it good.
[553.78 → 555.50] He called it to in Hebrew.
[555.76 → 556.52] He called it good.
[556.76 → 558.48] And He called it very good
[558.48 → 560.54] when He saw the creation that He created.
[561.38 → 563.48] And for the benefit of this good,
[563.60 → 564.68] created world,
[565.08 → 568.04] God creates humans in His own image.
[569.12 → 569.74] He created,
[569.94 → 570.42] in the Hebrew,
[570.58 → 572.36] we look at the word Adam,
[572.94 → 573.74] where we get Adam,
[574.08 → 575.34] from Adam.
[576.12 → 577.80] And Adam just means dirt,
[578.06 → 578.32] earth.
[578.78 → 580.02] That's a Hebrew word for earth.
[580.72 → 581.44] And so too,
[581.54 → 582.46] it's a word play here.
[582.46 → 583.46] It's not just saying,
[583.62 → 584.54] oh, He created man,
[584.60 → 585.14] and that's it.
[585.30 → 586.52] That's what He created first.
[586.80 → 588.34] He created humankind,
[588.86 → 590.14] earthlings from the dirt.
[590.84 → 592.54] And in God's own image,
[592.78 → 593.80] He created them,
[594.30 → 595.36] male and female,
[595.58 → 596.72] Genesis 1.27.
[598.08 → 600.58] He created humans in His own image,
[600.90 → 601.84] male and female,
[601.94 → 602.68] He created them,
[602.94 → 603.90] to fill the earth,
[604.10 → 606.16] and to rule and care over
[606.16 → 607.48] the whole world,
[607.60 → 609.32] the good world that He created.
[609.32 → 612.00] And so this chapter in the story,
[612.08 → 613.04] the beginning chapter,
[613.52 → 615.62] portrays the image of a good,
[616.06 → 616.52] caring,
[616.76 → 617.54] creator God,
[618.12 → 620.48] who commissions His own image bearers
[620.48 → 623.12] to continue that work of creation,
[623.78 → 625.20] flourishing and enjoying
[625.20 → 626.90] every bit of its goodness.
[627.62 → 629.04] And here we get to say,
[629.34 → 630.22] what we couldn't say
[630.22 → 631.82] when we were doing the Beatitudes series,
[632.06 → 633.78] when we were looking at a lot of the brokenness,
[633.82 → 634.48] we kept saying,
[634.82 → 636.56] it's not the way it's supposed to be.
[636.56 → 637.76] But here,
[637.86 → 638.86] at the beginning of the story,
[639.30 → 642.54] everything is the way it's supposed to be.
[643.24 → 644.98] God made it the way it's supposed to be,
[645.06 → 646.32] and it is good.
[648.06 → 649.28] And in this goodness,
[650.14 → 652.00] the most important part here,
[652.40 → 653.54] in the part of this,
[653.78 → 655.44] in the midst of this good creation,
[655.92 → 657.30] all relationships
[657.30 → 659.44] between God Himself,
[660.28 → 663.00] between God and His image bearer humans,
[663.00 → 665.40] and all of non-human creation,
[665.80 → 667.90] were in perfect relationship.
[668.36 → 668.82] Shalom.
[669.76 → 671.38] Harmonious, perfect relationship.
[671.78 → 672.82] The way it's supposed to be.
[673.20 → 674.58] And how great would it be
[674.58 → 676.28] if the story just ended there?
[676.78 → 678.70] If we didn't have that big X mark
[678.70 → 679.88] in the next stage.
[681.16 → 683.16] But we know how the story continues.
[683.56 → 685.14] And we get that big X
[685.14 → 686.40] telling us
[686.40 → 688.00] that the following chapters,
[688.28 → 689.72] right after Genesis 2,
[689.72 → 691.42] in Genesis chapter 3,
[691.98 → 693.34] literally the next chapter,
[693.76 → 696.04] we get introduced,
[696.24 → 696.76] I should say,
[697.02 → 697.52] to sin.
[698.10 → 699.74] And rightly called rebellion.
[700.14 → 701.32] Because that's what
[701.32 → 702.74] God's image bearers
[702.74 → 704.04] did against God.
[704.14 → 704.98] They rebelled
[704.98 → 707.04] against their good creator.
[707.42 → 708.66] And in Genesis 3.1,
[708.84 → 709.98] that's where we see,
[710.54 → 711.72] and we start to see,
[712.02 → 712.98] that seed of doubt
[712.98 → 713.78] being planted
[713.78 → 714.72] into the humans.
[715.68 → 716.68] By the serpent,
[716.78 → 717.44] when he says,
[717.66 → 718.62] in Genesis 3.1,
[718.62 → 720.30] did God really say?
[721.74 → 723.18] Just a simple question.
[723.72 → 724.82] Did God really say
[724.82 → 726.34] to not eat from that fruit?
[727.40 → 729.00] Planting that seed of doubt first,
[729.22 → 730.46] and then continuing on.
[730.72 → 731.76] Genesis 3.5,
[731.94 → 732.64] what does he say?
[733.12 → 734.22] No, I don't think
[734.22 → 735.32] he really forbid you.
[736.02 → 737.68] I think that God knows
[737.68 → 739.26] that when you eat from it,
[739.50 → 740.66] from that forbidden fruit,
[741.00 → 742.40] your eyes will be open,
[742.76 → 744.62] and you will be like God.
[745.72 → 746.82] That's a scary phrase.
[746.82 → 748.88] You will be like God,
[749.58 → 750.90] knowing good and evil.
[752.10 → 753.08] Like God.
[753.64 → 754.54] In other words,
[755.50 → 755.88] for me,
[755.94 → 756.80] this is very central
[756.80 → 757.58] to the description,
[758.00 → 759.60] definition of what sin is.
[760.98 → 762.42] You, humans,
[762.56 → 764.34] made in the image of God,
[764.52 → 765.94] who is supposed to be obedient
[765.94 → 766.90] to the good creator,
[766.90 → 769.44] you now have the ability
[769.44 → 771.60] to judge between good and evil
[771.60 → 773.26] without God,
[773.46 → 774.94] meaning you can be like him,
[775.08 → 776.86] and you can think to yourself,
[777.04 → 778.24] you're better than I.
[779.54 → 781.34] That's the rebellion.
[781.78 → 783.00] That's what's happening here.
[783.68 → 785.10] The rebellion goes from,
[785.24 → 785.40] again,
[785.58 → 787.00] being faithfully obedient
[787.00 → 788.80] to a good and loving maker,
[789.14 → 790.00] making choices
[790.00 → 791.74] and ruling over creation
[791.74 → 793.58] in reflection of God's goodness.
[793.58 → 795.54] So you go from that perfect,
[795.82 → 796.84] harmonious relationship
[796.84 → 797.60] and obedience
[797.60 → 799.48] to now thinking,
[799.78 → 800.60] God,
[800.66 → 801.74] why'd you do it that way?
[802.66 → 803.78] I wouldn't have done that
[803.78 → 804.32] if I were you.
[804.76 → 805.10] Really?
[805.44 → 806.54] You're going to create us naked?
[806.80 → 807.54] That's shameful.
[807.82 → 808.86] Let's just cover it up.
[809.04 → 809.86] I don't agree
[809.86 → 811.26] that you created us good.
[812.30 → 813.78] And they cover themselves in shame.
[815.48 → 816.74] And what that did,
[816.96 → 818.80] so the start of doubt here,
[819.08 → 820.68] trying to overthrow God's throne,
[820.68 → 823.64] what that did was throw the whole ordered
[823.64 → 826.14] good creation into now chaos.
[826.94 → 828.86] And this parasitic cancer-like disease
[828.86 → 829.74] called sin
[829.74 → 832.66] affected every bit of creation,
[833.00 → 834.38] including the relationship
[834.38 → 835.44] between God,
[835.70 → 836.32] his humans,
[836.66 → 838.44] and all of non-human creation.
[838.62 → 840.12] All relationships are broken.
[841.26 → 843.16] And it seems like hope is lost
[843.16 → 845.26] as the chapters of this biblical story continue.
[845.52 → 847.20] When we get to that rebellion stage,
[847.26 → 847.66] we go,
[848.26 → 849.28] what is going on?
[849.28 → 851.92] Where is this chaos coming from?
[852.56 → 853.48] Where is God?
[855.22 → 857.66] The first murder is recorded
[857.66 → 859.90] right in the next chapter in Genesis 4,
[860.36 → 861.78] where we have the murder
[861.78 → 863.90] between brothers of all people,
[864.44 → 865.58] own family members.
[866.56 → 868.08] And then we get to witness
[868.08 → 869.50] the wickedness grow,
[869.88 → 871.02] and it even describes
[871.02 → 873.32] how God even regretted making humans.
[874.44 → 875.26] And then you go,
[875.42 → 876.52] skip to Genesis 11,
[876.52 → 878.96] we get the picture of the Tower of Babel,
[879.28 → 880.46] where it shows us
[880.46 → 882.42] to what extent human beings would go
[882.42 → 884.14] to try to be gods themselves.
[884.50 → 884.88] Again,
[885.06 → 886.88] trying to judge between good and evil
[886.88 → 889.14] because we think we're better than God.
[890.46 → 891.80] And sin is rampant.
[893.16 → 894.28] And here at this point,
[894.52 → 895.72] we stop at Genesis 11,
[896.40 → 898.14] and I don't think you have to even look
[898.14 → 898.98] at just the Bible
[898.98 → 900.34] to see how sin is real.
[901.00 → 902.34] This sad reality of sin
[902.34 → 903.44] that we see from the Bible
[903.44 → 905.42] is reflected in all of human history.
[905.78 → 907.16] And I think it's a very fair,
[907.38 → 908.20] general assessment
[908.20 → 909.94] if you're kind of a history lover
[909.94 → 910.62] like I am.
[910.76 → 913.18] If you study any ancient history,
[913.30 → 915.62] or actually just any social studies,
[915.68 → 916.28] even today,
[916.46 → 917.74] you get to see that
[917.74 → 919.04] every civilization,
[919.68 → 919.94] whether,
[920.20 → 921.10] no matter I should say,
[921.26 → 922.90] how advanced or developed
[922.90 → 923.90] they may have been,
[924.02 → 925.14] or are today,
[926.08 → 927.88] run into the same problem of sin
[927.88 → 929.04] and all the brokenness
[929.04 → 929.84] that come with it,
[930.22 → 931.96] whether it be diseases,
[933.24 → 934.08] COVID-19,
[934.66 → 936.90] that plagued whole nations,
[937.00 → 938.42] or whether it be the injustice
[938.42 → 940.26] reflected in ancient history,
[940.40 → 941.94] or the injustice reflected
[941.94 → 943.74] in our societies today,
[944.16 → 945.20] or the extremes
[945.20 → 947.40] like sacrificing their own babies
[947.40 → 949.06] to win divine favour,
[949.34 → 950.38] whatever extremes,
[950.78 → 952.20] whatever brokenness it is,
[952.54 → 955.32] sin was and is real
[955.32 → 957.78] and affects every bit of creation.
[959.50 → 961.56] So going back to the biblical story here,
[962.04 → 962.80] we're still at the rebellion.
[963.46 → 964.32] I want to get out of it,
[964.38 → 966.06] but that's the reality of the world.
[966.82 → 968.02] I think it's fair to wonder
[968.02 → 968.70] and ask here,
[969.48 → 970.80] where are you, God?
[972.56 → 974.46] That good, caring creator
[974.46 → 975.54] at the beginning that we saw,
[975.60 → 976.20] where are you?
[977.78 → 979.42] Where is God
[979.42 → 980.50] that made humans
[980.50 → 981.64] in His own image
[981.64 → 983.08] to reflect His goodness
[983.08 → 984.00] and flourish
[984.00 → 985.14] in His good creation?
[985.32 → 988.34] Is it like the many
[988.34 → 989.32] ancient worldviews
[989.32 → 990.58] that thought that a God,
[990.90 → 991.86] some divine being,
[992.10 → 993.16] or gods, plural,
[993.96 → 995.86] were made humans
[995.86 → 996.92] just as slaves
[996.92 → 998.28] and had no care
[998.28 → 999.44] for what was happening
[999.44 → 1000.02] in creation?
[1000.34 → 1001.24] Or the worldview
[1001.24 → 1001.86] where they thought
[1001.86 → 1003.28] that the same gods
[1003.28 → 1003.96] or divine figures
[1003.96 → 1005.22] were way, way out there
[1005.22 → 1006.26] and they had no care
[1006.26 → 1007.12] for this world?
[1007.96 → 1009.14] Is that the worldview
[1009.14 → 1010.10] that the Bible story
[1010.10 → 1011.02] presents to us?
[1011.38 → 1012.60] Is that our God?
[1012.60 → 1015.54] Obviously, no.
[1016.50 → 1017.08] And then you get
[1017.08 → 1018.02] to Genesis 12,
[1018.60 → 1020.40] where God initiates
[1020.40 → 1022.00] His plan of redemption
[1022.00 → 1022.84] and restoration
[1022.84 → 1024.30] from all of this
[1024.30 → 1025.54] sin and brokenness
[1025.54 → 1026.46] through a man
[1026.46 → 1027.62] named
[1027.62 → 1029.94] Genesis 12.
[1030.62 → 1031.20] Like, I mean,
[1031.90 → 1032.76] albeit my wife,
[1032.84 → 1034.38] when I was sharing this yesterday,
[1034.46 → 1034.82] she said,
[1034.92 → 1035.18] Jesus.
[1036.46 → 1037.60] Yes, that's always
[1037.60 → 1038.32] the right answer.
[1038.32 → 1038.90] Of course,
[1039.00 → 1039.46] through Jesus
[1039.46 → 1040.38] we are redeemed,
[1040.72 → 1041.18] but here,
[1041.32 → 1042.88] specifically in Genesis 12,
[1043.66 → 1045.30] my preacher preached
[1045.30 → 1046.18] this part for us
[1046.18 → 1047.08] a few weeks ago.
[1047.42 → 1048.22] Genesis 12,
[1048.54 → 1049.88] God chooses a man
[1049.88 → 1051.94] named Abram.
[1052.58 → 1053.28] Some of you say
[1053.28 → 1053.62] Abraham.
[1053.86 → 1054.44] Yes, yes,
[1054.46 → 1054.84] that's right,
[1054.92 → 1055.74] but it's Abram
[1055.74 → 1057.18] who gets renamed
[1057.18 → 1057.98] into Abraham,
[1058.10 → 1059.32] the father of many nations,
[1059.68 → 1061.02] chosen by God
[1061.02 → 1062.72] to reflect His blessing
[1062.72 → 1063.58] for the world again.
[1064.30 → 1065.38] God initiates
[1065.38 → 1065.96] that plan.
[1066.18 → 1066.82] He does not
[1066.82 → 1067.98] abandon humanity.
[1067.98 → 1069.12] He's not some God
[1069.12 → 1070.30] way, way out there.
[1070.44 → 1070.68] No.
[1071.36 → 1072.04] He chooses
[1072.04 → 1073.60] an image bearer,
[1074.66 → 1076.10] an imperfect one at that,
[1076.62 → 1077.24] and He says,
[1077.58 → 1078.54] I will make you
[1078.54 → 1079.40] into a people,
[1079.74 → 1080.40] a nation
[1080.40 → 1081.96] that is chosen by me
[1081.96 → 1082.98] to reflect
[1082.98 → 1084.56] blessing for the world again.
[1085.06 → 1086.00] So here's the picture
[1086.00 → 1086.84] at this point
[1086.84 → 1087.74] in Genesis 12.
[1088.02 → 1089.48] That's the start of Israel,
[1089.80 → 1090.84] that horizontal arrow.
[1091.90 → 1092.54] Here's the picture
[1092.54 → 1093.24] in Genesis 12.
[1093.50 → 1094.56] Because God knew
[1094.56 → 1095.58] and saw,
[1096.00 → 1096.54] and I quote
[1096.54 → 1097.62] a Bible verse here,
[1097.98 → 1099.50] God saw how great
[1099.50 → 1100.20] the wickedness
[1100.20 → 1101.04] of the human race
[1101.04 → 1102.26] had become on earth
[1102.26 → 1104.30] and that every inclination
[1104.30 → 1105.20] of the thoughts
[1105.20 → 1106.24] of the human heart
[1106.24 → 1108.16] was only evil
[1108.16 → 1109.34] all the time.
[1109.68 → 1110.40] That's depressing.
[1110.84 → 1111.46] That's sin.
[1111.58 → 1112.24] That's reality.
[1112.94 → 1114.04] And then He chose,
[1114.48 → 1116.34] out of His loving kindness
[1116.34 → 1117.14] and goodness
[1117.14 → 1118.26] and His grace,
[1118.90 → 1119.56] a people,
[1120.02 → 1120.98] a royal priesthood,
[1121.94 → 1123.10] a holy nation
[1123.10 → 1125.02] as His special possession
[1125.02 → 1126.00] to be instruments
[1126.00 → 1126.98] of His redemption
[1126.98 → 1127.80] and restoration.
[1130.42 → 1131.72] If you end it there,
[1131.82 → 1132.54] that is kind of
[1132.54 → 1133.32] the full story.
[1134.06 → 1135.20] Chooses a people,
[1135.76 → 1136.68] His special possession
[1136.68 → 1138.24] to redeem the world,
[1138.44 → 1139.00] and it's done
[1139.00 → 1140.48] through a man named Jesus,
[1140.62 → 1141.24] His own Son.
[1142.84 → 1144.26] And if you know your Bible,
[1144.88 → 1145.58] the two verses
[1145.58 → 1147.02] that I just quoted here
[1147.02 → 1148.74] was from Genesis 6
[1148.74 → 1149.46] that describes
[1149.46 → 1149.94] the growth
[1149.94 → 1150.62] of the wickedness
[1150.62 → 1151.08] of humans
[1151.08 → 1152.38] during the time of Noah
[1152.38 → 1154.84] and also 1 Peter 2
[1154.84 → 1155.70] in the New Testament
[1155.70 → 1156.92] all in the same breath
[1156.92 → 1157.94] because it captures
[1157.94 → 1159.70] that full gospel story.
[1160.42 → 1161.50] I know we're jumping ahead,
[1162.32 → 1164.24] but you can't really skip
[1164.24 → 1165.52] the redemption part,
[1165.58 → 1165.86] can you?
[1166.00 → 1166.96] That's the central
[1166.96 → 1168.24] of the whole biblical story.
[1169.42 → 1171.64] Jesus achieved for us
[1171.64 → 1173.40] what no image-bearing humans
[1173.40 → 1173.84] can do,
[1174.42 → 1174.98] could do.
[1176.36 → 1178.20] He won victory over sin
[1178.20 → 1179.54] and all its brokenness
[1179.54 → 1181.34] and then the ultimate enemy
[1181.34 → 1181.82] as well,
[1182.08 → 1183.00] which is death.
[1184.58 → 1185.72] So go back here
[1185.72 → 1186.88] to that arrow to Israel.
[1187.30 → 1188.34] We know where this story
[1188.34 → 1188.94] takes us.
[1189.58 → 1190.02] Israel,
[1191.34 → 1192.36] chosen to be a blessing,
[1192.64 → 1193.98] failed to be that blessing,
[1194.46 → 1195.66] chose the way of course
[1195.66 → 1196.32] instead of the way
[1196.32 → 1196.90] of blessing,
[1197.00 → 1197.72] and they failed,
[1197.94 → 1199.30] and they were without hope.
[1200.52 → 1202.78] They lived in a false story
[1202.78 → 1203.72] instead of letting
[1203.72 → 1205.78] the biblical true story
[1205.78 → 1207.36] lead them and guide them
[1207.36 → 1208.74] in their way of blessing.
[1210.66 → 1211.92] And so if you only have
[1211.92 → 1213.42] this story up to Malachi,
[1213.62 → 1214.22] and let's say
[1214.22 → 1215.46] that that was all
[1215.46 → 1215.98] that you had,
[1216.04 → 1216.56] which is the end
[1216.56 → 1217.28] of the Old Testament,
[1217.92 → 1219.50] it's a pretty depressing story
[1219.50 → 1220.12] if you tell me
[1220.12 → 1222.28] because they're lingering
[1222.28 → 1223.72] and they're anticipating
[1223.72 → 1225.28] a Messiah,
[1225.44 → 1226.00] a chosen one,
[1226.22 → 1227.54] the hope of their salvation,
[1227.74 → 1229.32] but he hasn't come yet,
[1229.44 → 1229.86] has he?
[1230.24 → 1231.74] Not by the end of Malachi.
[1231.74 → 1234.52] But we know,
[1235.60 → 1236.74] and here we can relate
[1236.74 → 1237.56] to the Old Testament,
[1237.76 → 1238.18] some of them
[1238.18 → 1239.18] and how they say,
[1239.74 → 1241.68] where is God?
[1243.00 → 1243.48] Again,
[1243.72 → 1244.98] where is that good,
[1245.26 → 1245.86] caring creator
[1245.86 → 1246.34] that we saw
[1246.34 → 1246.86] at the beginning?
[1247.24 → 1247.96] Where are you?
[1248.62 → 1249.90] David says in his Psalms,
[1249.96 → 1250.44] in his prayer,
[1250.54 → 1250.78] he says,
[1251.04 → 1252.66] will you abandon me forever?
[1254.82 → 1257.16] But God never left
[1257.16 → 1258.48] and abandoned his people,
[1258.58 → 1258.84] did he?
[1258.84 → 1261.12] All throughout
[1261.12 → 1261.82] the Old Testament,
[1261.94 → 1263.16] even before we get
[1263.16 → 1263.98] to Jesus coming,
[1264.60 → 1265.64] we get shadows
[1265.64 → 1266.88] or glimpses
[1266.88 → 1268.30] of the Messianic figure,
[1268.46 → 1269.54] which points to Jesus,
[1269.72 → 1270.04] obviously.
[1270.52 → 1271.58] And as Dave pointed out
[1271.58 → 1272.46] for us last week
[1272.46 → 1273.04] when he quoted,
[1273.32 → 1273.86] when he preached
[1273.86 → 1274.88] from 1 Corinthians,
[1275.26 → 1276.34] that according to
[1276.34 → 1276.94] the scriptures,
[1277.30 → 1278.20] according to this
[1278.20 → 1279.50] Old Testament story,
[1280.02 → 1281.78] Jesus died
[1281.78 → 1282.74] and was buried
[1282.74 → 1283.72] and was raised
[1283.72 → 1284.58] to life again
[1284.58 → 1286.12] because as he won
[1286.12 → 1287.52] victory over sin
[1287.52 → 1288.82] and all of its brokenness,
[1288.84 → 1289.68] that's why
[1289.68 → 1291.22] that's so central.
[1291.78 → 1293.34] Everything is about Jesus.
[1294.20 → 1295.28] That is the core
[1295.28 → 1296.54] of our biblical story.
[1297.76 → 1298.42] And now,
[1298.90 → 1300.44] the story continues on.
[1301.36 → 1302.42] We're living out
[1302.42 → 1302.94] that story
[1302.94 → 1303.70] as we have it.
[1304.86 → 1306.06] The call to faith
[1306.06 → 1306.90] for us today
[1306.90 → 1308.18] is not, again,
[1308.46 → 1309.66] just some religious,
[1310.00 → 1311.32] moralistic obligation
[1311.32 → 1312.24] to a way of life
[1312.24 → 1313.00] among many,
[1313.68 → 1315.84] some sort of option
[1315.84 → 1316.68] that you have to take
[1316.68 → 1317.76] to achieve some sort
[1317.76 → 1318.88] of afterlife paradise.
[1319.70 → 1321.32] But our Christian faith,
[1321.58 → 1322.86] our faith that we live,
[1323.12 → 1323.96] is a story
[1323.96 → 1325.22] that we are living out
[1325.22 → 1326.54] right now as we live.
[1327.44 → 1328.64] And just like Israel
[1328.64 → 1329.22] was chosen
[1329.22 → 1330.88] as God's holy nation,
[1331.24 → 1331.80] holy people
[1331.80 → 1332.48] to be a blessing
[1332.48 → 1333.02] for the world,
[1333.10 → 1334.16] to join his mission
[1334.16 → 1334.70] in redemption,
[1335.12 → 1336.38] we are now today
[1336.38 → 1336.94] chosen
[1336.94 → 1338.80] as God's special possession,
[1339.12 → 1339.96] as God's people
[1339.96 → 1341.22] called the church.
[1341.22 → 1342.94] And that's what
[1342.94 → 1344.48] those two horizontal arrows
[1344.48 → 1346.02] signify for us.
[1346.70 → 1347.14] And then,
[1347.30 → 1348.22] always when I get
[1348.22 → 1348.98] to this stage
[1348.98 → 1350.36] and this part of the story,
[1350.68 → 1351.82] I always have to stop
[1351.82 → 1352.54] and ask myself,
[1352.94 → 1354.84] what's the difference then?
[1355.52 → 1356.78] Why the two
[1356.78 → 1358.14] chosen people of God?
[1359.10 → 1360.84] Why did Israel fail?
[1361.62 → 1363.02] Why do we need Jesus?
[1363.52 → 1365.14] And why are we chosen again
[1365.14 → 1366.06] to be that blessing?
[1366.66 → 1367.62] What's the difference
[1367.62 → 1369.08] between Israel and church?
[1369.08 → 1372.78] There are two sides
[1372.78 → 1373.76] to this in my opinion.
[1373.92 → 1375.36] I suggest that on one side,
[1375.88 → 1377.04] not much of a difference
[1377.04 → 1378.42] in the sense that
[1378.42 → 1379.90] we also fail
[1379.90 → 1380.96] and sometimes
[1380.96 → 1382.56] let the false stories
[1382.56 → 1383.30] of our culture
[1383.30 → 1383.98] lead us
[1383.98 → 1385.26] more than the true
[1385.26 → 1386.16] biblical narrative.
[1387.02 → 1387.80] So in that sense,
[1387.86 → 1388.84] we're not that much different.
[1389.46 → 1389.78] Also,
[1389.92 → 1390.72] not much different
[1390.72 → 1392.00] because we also
[1392.00 → 1393.88] know that sin is real
[1393.88 → 1395.14] and that sin affects
[1395.14 → 1396.14] all of our lives,
[1396.26 → 1396.90] whether it be
[1396.90 → 1397.84] in our relationships,
[1398.28 → 1398.92] our spiritual,
[1399.08 → 1399.78] or emotional
[1399.78 → 1400.88] or physical health,
[1401.02 → 1402.06] or the injustice
[1402.06 → 1404.06] of governments today,
[1404.18 → 1405.10] or the failure
[1405.10 → 1406.32] to care and cultivate
[1406.32 → 1407.02] creation
[1407.02 → 1408.14] as God's
[1408.14 → 1408.68] with,
[1409.26 → 1409.86] in alignment
[1409.86 → 1410.68] with God's heart.
[1411.20 → 1412.18] Whatever shortcomings
[1412.18 → 1412.86] we have,
[1413.34 → 1414.58] sin is still real.
[1415.44 → 1416.02] And so again,
[1416.10 → 1416.86] in that sense,
[1417.20 → 1418.16] we are not much
[1418.16 → 1419.08] different from Israel.
[1420.96 → 1421.92] And so what is
[1421.92 → 1422.36] the difference?
[1422.48 → 1422.92] What is the other
[1422.92 → 1423.72] side of the coin here?
[1424.74 → 1426.02] The difference then
[1426.02 → 1428.10] is that we are
[1428.10 → 1429.08] in a different place
[1429.08 → 1430.18] in this story
[1430.18 → 1431.44] in 2023.
[1432.70 → 1434.38] We live in a time
[1434.38 → 1436.60] after the salvation
[1436.60 → 1437.80] by Jesus
[1437.80 → 1438.70] and His plan
[1438.70 → 1439.60] of redemption
[1439.60 → 1441.50] has been totally
[1441.50 → 1442.32] accomplished
[1442.32 → 1443.58] once and for all.
[1443.66 → 1444.36] That victory
[1444.36 → 1445.92] is already won.
[1446.12 → 1447.10] We live in a time
[1447.10 → 1448.30] after that is
[1448.30 → 1449.12] fully revealed
[1449.12 → 1449.78] for us.
[1449.78 → 1450.94] and now we are
[1450.94 → 1451.54] equipped
[1451.54 → 1453.20] by God's
[1453.20 → 1454.06] Spirit Himself
[1454.06 → 1455.46] to live out
[1455.46 → 1456.00] that mission
[1456.00 → 1456.52] of redemption.
[1459.84 → 1460.74] Just looking
[1460.74 → 1461.46] at the chronology
[1461.46 → 1461.78] here,
[1462.04 → 1462.76] we live in a time
[1462.76 → 1463.50] right after
[1463.50 → 1464.44] the redemption
[1464.44 → 1466.08] won by Jesus Christ.
[1466.42 → 1466.92] And we know
[1466.92 → 1467.64] that He has,
[1467.76 → 1467.92] again,
[1468.06 → 1468.60] gifted us
[1468.60 → 1469.98] with His Holy Spirit
[1469.98 → 1471.18] to be witnesses
[1471.18 → 1472.40] to this story
[1472.40 → 1473.40] to the ends
[1473.40 → 1474.06] of the earth,
[1474.20 → 1474.96] Acts 1.8.
[1476.28 → 1477.26] We get to look
[1477.26 → 1478.26] forward to a day
[1478.26 → 1479.76] when all suffering
[1479.76 → 1480.36] and pain
[1480.36 → 1480.86] and sorrow
[1480.86 → 1481.46] will end.
[1482.46 → 1483.20] And this is all
[1483.20 → 1484.56] done by the work
[1484.56 → 1485.18] of the cross
[1485.18 → 1486.14] and the resurrection
[1486.14 → 1486.86] of our Saviour
[1486.86 → 1487.64] Jesus Christ.
[1488.66 → 1489.58] That's God's
[1489.58 → 1490.74] perfect created world
[1490.74 → 1492.14] restored here,
[1492.86 → 1493.58] not out there.
[1494.02 → 1494.78] The arrow points
[1494.78 → 1497.06] down for restoration.
[1499.26 → 1500.02] And a practical
[1500.02 → 1500.80] difference.
[1501.08 → 1501.78] Israel was
[1501.78 → 1503.18] one nation.
[1504.00 → 1504.74] One nation.
[1505.26 → 1505.86] Mostly one
[1505.86 → 1506.62] ethnicity group.
[1506.62 → 1508.36] God's mission
[1508.36 → 1509.64] is for the whole
[1509.64 → 1510.70] world to join
[1510.70 → 1511.20] His kingdom,
[1511.56 → 1512.76] not just the Israelites,
[1513.38 → 1514.36] not just one nation.
[1515.22 → 1515.90] It's evident
[1515.90 → 1516.44] just now.
[1516.58 → 1517.18] Just look around.
[1517.84 → 1518.48] Are we all
[1518.48 → 1519.18] just Israelites?
[1519.74 → 1520.66] Are we just
[1520.66 → 1521.34] all Dutch?
[1522.60 → 1523.44] Not really.
[1524.00 → 1524.70] And thank God
[1524.70 → 1525.36] for that.
[1525.76 → 1525.94] Not,
[1526.20 → 1526.48] I'm not,
[1526.70 → 1527.34] it's a compliment.
[1527.90 → 1528.82] We're reflecting
[1528.82 → 1529.72] God's kingdom here.
[1530.36 → 1531.22] If you don't have
[1531.22 → 1532.18] a van in your name
[1532.18 → 1533.20] or your last name,
[1533.38 → 1534.08] it's a good thing.
[1534.08 → 1534.50] You know?
[1535.24 → 1536.46] We reflect God's
[1536.46 → 1536.76] kingdom.
[1537.18 → 1537.90] This is what Paul
[1537.90 → 1539.30] says for the Galatian
[1539.30 → 1539.68] church.
[1540.04 → 1540.74] There is neither
[1540.74 → 1542.12] Jew nor Gentile,
[1542.40 → 1543.62] neither slave nor free,
[1544.02 → 1545.06] nor is there male
[1545.06 → 1545.72] or female,
[1545.96 → 1546.68] for you are all
[1546.68 → 1548.24] one in Christ Jesus.
[1548.54 → 1549.42] And we get to look
[1549.42 → 1550.66] to a day when
[1550.66 → 1551.64] every tongue
[1551.64 → 1552.34] and every knee
[1552.34 → 1553.10] will bow
[1553.10 → 1554.02] before our Lord
[1554.02 → 1554.88] Jesus Christ.
[1556.42 → 1556.98] That's
[1556.98 → 1558.10] the church.
[1559.22 → 1560.20] That's what Israel
[1560.20 → 1560.96] was supposed to be,
[1561.10 → 1561.24] too.
[1561.24 → 1563.90] The true judge
[1563.90 → 1564.70] is coming back.
[1565.46 → 1566.60] Jesus is coming back.
[1567.12 → 1568.08] We will no longer
[1568.08 → 1569.08] have to be tainted
[1569.08 → 1569.94] with sin
[1569.94 → 1570.76] in the sense
[1570.76 → 1571.76] that we no longer
[1571.76 → 1573.60] have to make judgments
[1573.60 → 1574.68] of good and evil
[1574.68 → 1575.36] on our own
[1575.36 → 1576.16] without God.
[1577.08 → 1577.90] Through the obedience
[1577.90 → 1578.48] of Jesus,
[1578.64 → 1579.50] we get to be free
[1579.50 → 1580.68] from disobedience
[1580.68 → 1581.60] and we will get
[1581.60 → 1583.12] to enjoy the harmonious
[1583.12 → 1584.82] shalom relationship
[1584.82 → 1585.88] with God,
[1586.10 → 1586.82] with one another,
[1587.12 → 1588.08] with ourselves,
[1589.04 → 1590.04] and with the rest
[1590.04 → 1590.64] of creation.
[1591.24 → 1591.74] Shalom.
[1592.30 → 1592.66] And in our
[1592.66 → 1593.68] Beatitudes series,
[1594.56 → 1595.74] Jesus blesses
[1595.74 → 1596.80] those who hunger
[1596.80 → 1597.76] and thirst
[1597.76 → 1598.58] for that righteousness
[1598.58 → 1599.10] again.
[1600.18 → 1601.80] A God-sized craving
[1601.80 → 1602.94] for that restoration
[1602.94 → 1604.08] to happen again.
[1604.28 → 1605.10] For that restoration
[1605.10 → 1606.44] we get to look forward to.
[1606.62 → 1607.40] To the hope
[1607.40 → 1608.60] that we get to live in
[1608.60 → 1609.58] through the work
[1609.58 → 1610.16] of Jesus.
[1611.82 → 1612.54] And then we look
[1612.54 → 1613.08] to the end
[1613.08 → 1613.72] of this story.
[1614.12 → 1614.68] And we quote this
[1614.68 → 1615.42] so many times.
[1615.80 → 1616.74] Revelation 21.
[1617.20 → 1617.86] This is where
[1617.86 → 1619.32] God's story ends
[1619.32 → 1620.26] and begins
[1620.26 → 1621.08] anew forever.
[1621.08 → 1622.38] Then I saw
[1622.38 → 1623.02] a new heaven
[1623.02 → 1623.76] and a new earth
[1623.76 → 1624.92] and I heard
[1624.92 → 1625.78] a loud voice
[1625.78 → 1626.32] from the throne
[1626.32 → 1626.68] saying,
[1626.92 → 1627.12] Look,
[1627.74 → 1629.24] God's dwelling place
[1629.24 → 1630.64] is now among
[1630.64 → 1631.26] the people
[1631.26 → 1632.54] and he will dwell
[1632.54 → 1633.96] with us.
[1635.12 → 1635.82] They will be
[1635.82 → 1636.48] his people
[1636.48 → 1637.40] and God himself
[1637.40 → 1638.28] will be with them
[1638.28 → 1639.22] and be their God.
[1639.58 → 1640.20] He will wipe
[1640.20 → 1641.24] every tear
[1641.24 → 1642.02] from their eyes.
[1642.32 → 1642.82] There will be
[1642.82 → 1643.66] no more death
[1643.66 → 1644.30] or mourning
[1644.30 → 1645.28] or crying or pain
[1645.28 → 1646.52] for the old order
[1646.52 → 1646.92] of things
[1646.92 → 1647.80] has passed away.
[1648.14 → 1648.92] We don't look
[1648.92 → 1649.60] to a story
[1649.60 → 1650.12] where it's
[1650.12 → 1651.92] an imperfect finish.
[1653.18 → 1654.06] This story
[1654.06 → 1654.84] doesn't end
[1654.84 → 1656.50] with some sort
[1656.50 → 1657.68] of glimmering
[1657.68 → 1658.42] sense of hope.
[1659.00 → 1659.72] This story
[1659.72 → 1661.04] ends with perfection
[1661.04 → 1662.14] where God
[1662.14 → 1663.58] fully restores
[1663.58 → 1664.50] all creation.
[1666.22 → 1667.04] And so for us
[1667.04 → 1667.42] today,
[1668.26 → 1669.26] for us today,
[1669.96 → 1670.72] as you hear
[1670.72 → 1671.22] this story,
[1671.30 → 1672.32] I think the challenge
[1672.32 → 1673.82] is to see
[1673.82 → 1674.66] that you belong
[1674.66 → 1675.50] in this story.
[1675.50 → 1677.24] We all belong
[1677.24 → 1678.00] in this
[1678.00 → 1679.12] biblical story.
[1680.12 → 1680.84] You matter
[1680.84 → 1682.00] because you are
[1682.00 → 1682.76] part of this
[1682.76 → 1683.60] grand narrative
[1683.60 → 1684.84] taking part
[1684.84 → 1685.76] as God's
[1685.76 → 1687.10] holy chosen people.
[1687.84 → 1688.54] We partake
[1688.54 → 1689.30] in his mission
[1689.30 → 1690.12] for that redemption.
[1691.76 → 1692.94] And in the coming weeks,
[1693.06 → 1693.78] it is our hope
[1693.78 → 1694.58] that as we
[1694.58 → 1696.22] look into the story
[1696.22 → 1696.90] of this series
[1696.90 → 1697.52] and the series
[1697.52 → 1698.02] to come,
[1698.44 → 1699.08] we want to see
[1699.08 → 1700.32] how this biblical story,
[1700.42 → 1701.50] which is our story,
[1701.90 → 1702.88] how that gets lived
[1702.88 → 1703.92] out in our homes,
[1703.92 → 1705.06] our workplaces,
[1705.22 → 1706.04] our relationships,
[1706.54 → 1707.86] our everyday lives,
[1707.96 → 1709.24] that you would find
[1709.24 → 1710.18] encouragement
[1710.18 → 1711.66] and you would find
[1711.66 → 1713.02] hope in your identity
[1713.02 → 1714.10] as children of God
[1714.10 → 1715.76] chosen to be a blessing
[1715.76 → 1716.50] for the world.
[1717.06 → 1718.16] That's what the story
[1718.16 → 1718.66] is about
[1718.66 → 1720.20] right now in our stage,
[1720.34 → 1720.90] in the story
[1720.90 → 1721.72] that we live in,
[1721.86 → 1722.54] in the chapters
[1722.54 → 1723.50] that we are writing
[1723.50 → 1725.20] as God leads us through.
[1726.74 → 1727.84] Be encouraged
[1727.84 → 1728.50] and know
[1728.50 → 1729.68] that you belong,
[1730.24 → 1730.86] that God
[1730.86 → 1732.04] loves you
[1732.04 → 1733.16] and has called you
[1733.16 → 1734.08] into this story
[1734.08 → 1734.90] as his people.
[1737.32 → 1738.12] May that be
[1738.12 → 1738.66] an encouragement
[1738.66 → 1739.22] for us
[1739.22 → 1740.04] as we are reminded
[1740.04 → 1741.76] of our identity
[1741.76 → 1742.96] through our Lord
[1742.96 → 1743.98] Jesus Christ.
[1744.32 → 1744.90] Let's pray.
[1744.90 → 1744.94] Let's pray.
[1752.02 → 1752.66] Good,
[1753.32 → 1753.64] caring,
[1753.80 → 1754.62] and loving Father,
[1755.42 → 1757.04] we come to you
[1757.04 → 1757.86] today again
[1757.86 → 1759.68] to worship
[1759.68 → 1760.76] your holy name,
[1760.76 → 1763.30] we know you
[1763.30 → 1764.22] are set apart.
[1765.24 → 1766.32] You are the creator
[1766.32 → 1767.54] of the whole universe
[1767.54 → 1769.60] and you have created
[1769.60 → 1770.88] us in your image
[1770.88 → 1772.34] to reflect
[1772.34 → 1773.12] your goodness
[1773.12 → 1773.76] for the world.
[1774.98 → 1775.46] Lord,
[1775.54 → 1776.02] forgive us
[1776.02 → 1776.58] for the times
[1776.58 → 1777.54] where we come short.
[1778.14 → 1779.40] We fail to live
[1779.40 → 1780.38] into this story
[1780.38 → 1782.10] what we're called for
[1782.10 → 1783.08] and we let
[1783.08 → 1784.12] the story of the world
[1784.12 → 1785.50] lead us
[1785.50 → 1786.26] more than yours.
[1788.76 → 1789.50] Strengthen us
[1789.50 → 1790.24] and guide us,
[1790.24 → 1790.96] remind us
[1790.96 → 1791.56] that your spirit
[1791.56 → 1792.98] is always with us
[1792.98 → 1794.44] and that you always
[1794.44 → 1795.80] lead and guide us
[1795.80 → 1797.66] back to your story.
[1798.34 → 1799.66] May we live that out
[1799.66 → 1800.32] to the fullest.
[1800.78 → 1801.68] May we enjoy
[1801.68 → 1802.58] that growth
[1802.58 → 1804.08] and flourishing life
[1804.08 → 1805.04] that you have promised
[1805.04 → 1805.66] for us,
[1806.20 → 1807.10] that we get to live
[1807.10 → 1808.50] the life that you have
[1808.50 → 1808.94] intended
[1808.94 → 1809.94] from the beginning,
[1810.06 → 1810.90] the way it's supposed
[1810.90 → 1811.26] to be.
[1812.52 → 1813.38] We thank you
[1813.38 → 1814.10] for this story.
[1814.58 → 1815.00] We thank you
[1815.00 → 1816.10] for this true story.
[1817.10 → 1818.38] May we glorify
[1818.38 → 1819.20] your name
[1819.20 → 1821.20] and worship you
[1821.20 → 1822.20] with our whole being
[1822.20 → 1823.52] as we live
[1823.52 → 1824.30] into this story.
[1824.64 → 1825.46] In Jesus' name,
[1826.30 → 1826.52] amen.
[1827.88 → 1829.08] I invite you to stand
[1829.08 → 1829.60] as we sing
[1829.60 → 1830.54] our song of response.
[1830.54 → 1831.16] and let us
[1831.16 → 1855.10] all Ezra
