[0.00 --> 3.48]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[4.32 --> 7.02]  This morning we get to celebrate the sacrament of baptism.
[7.36 --> 9.66]  We get to baptize little Sophia May Braidfeld.
[10.04 --> 12.50]  And I do want to say, I know Misha already mentioned this,
[12.56 --> 14.16]  but welcome to the family and the friends.
[14.32 --> 17.22]  I know that we have generations of family here,
[17.30 --> 20.96]  and it is a gift to have the family surround this little baby
[20.96 --> 23.92]  and join our church family in celebrating this sacrament.
[24.58 --> 26.26]  I'm going to say just a few words.
[26.64 --> 28.78]  I'll try my best to keep it a few about baptism,
[28.78 --> 31.18]  and then I'm going to invite Derek and Nancy and Sophia on the stage,
[31.28 --> 34.76]  as well as all of our cornerstone age kids in just a minute.
[36.28 --> 41.84]  In our church, we do believe that baptism is fundamentally about belonging.
[42.90 --> 46.60]  In fact, I think that before baptism says something about Sophia,
[46.78 --> 48.44]  it says something about the church.
[49.26 --> 54.18]  Baptism is the sacrament where Sophia joins the church.
[54.18 --> 58.88]  She becomes grafted into God's family, this family here.
[59.74 --> 62.56]  In Romans 6, it says that the church, the body of believers,
[62.78 --> 65.32]  is the community that has died in the death of Jesus.
[66.28 --> 70.00]  It says that the church is a community that has risen to new power and new life
[70.00 --> 71.50]  through the resurrection of Jesus.
[72.08 --> 77.14]  And that means that Sophia is joining a resurrection community,
[77.84 --> 80.10]  that the power of God that's at work in this family
[80.10 --> 82.22]  is now at work in her as part of this family.
[82.84 --> 85.22]  That the Spirit of God that is at work in this family
[85.22 --> 88.26]  is now at work in Sophia as part of this family.
[88.68 --> 91.22]  And we praise the Lord that the grace of Jesus Christ
[91.22 --> 94.98]  that covers over this church covers over Sophia.
[96.58 --> 97.94]  Now, throughout the biblical story,
[98.04 --> 100.54]  we really do believe that children belong.
[101.28 --> 103.94]  They are not sort of a secondary part of the church family.
[104.20 --> 104.94]  They belong.
[104.94 --> 106.86]  In the Old Testament, in the feasts,
[106.98 --> 109.18]  where they celebrated God's miraculous work
[109.18 --> 111.56]  rescuing His slave nation from Egypt,
[111.80 --> 113.74]  the children participated in the feasts.
[114.22 --> 115.34]  When the law was given,
[115.46 --> 118.20]  the entire community, including the babies, were there
[118.20 --> 120.70]  so that the babies and the infants and the children
[120.70 --> 123.08]  could hear the good instruction of God
[123.08 --> 126.00]  and be raised to live it out with their parents.
[126.96 --> 128.96]  In the New Testament, when Jesus is teaching,
[129.30 --> 131.50]  in fact, one of my favorite stories about children in the Bible,
[132.46 --> 134.52]  one who's coming up on the stage right now,
[134.94 --> 139.18]  it's ironic because here's the story.
[139.30 --> 142.02]  When Jesus was teaching about His ministry,
[142.58 --> 143.98]  there was children who came up to Jesus
[143.98 --> 145.10]  and the disciples thought,
[145.26 --> 146.18]  oh, He's too busy.
[146.28 --> 147.06]  They can't come.
[147.12 --> 148.42]  And they try to block the children.
[148.54 --> 149.78]  What does Jesus say to His disciples?
[151.06 --> 152.82]  Let the children come to Me,
[153.26 --> 156.58]  for to these belong the kingdom of heaven.
[157.60 --> 158.42]  Children belong.
[159.14 --> 161.46]  We also believe that in household baptisms
[161.46 --> 162.44]  in the book of Acts,
[162.82 --> 164.50]  the children belonged.
[164.94 --> 169.18]  A few things that I try to say at every baptism that we do,
[169.30 --> 170.68]  whether it's adult or child,
[171.12 --> 172.70]  is number one, we do not believe
[172.70 --> 174.84]  that baptism is a guarantee.
[175.50 --> 176.14]  That is to say,
[176.26 --> 178.70]  when little Sophia receives the water of baptism this morning,
[178.86 --> 180.40]  it doesn't mean that she is saved
[180.40 --> 182.74]  no matter what she does or how she lives
[182.74 --> 183.96]  or what decisions she makes.
[184.50 --> 186.96]  Sophia has a responsibility in this.
[186.96 --> 191.04]  But we also don't think that baptism is just an offer,
[191.52 --> 194.44]  that everything depends on the strength of Sophia's faith
[194.44 --> 196.96]  for her to follow Jesus and be part of this family.
[197.06 --> 200.26]  We believe that the grace and the power of God
[200.26 --> 202.54]  through Jesus and by the Spirit
[202.54 --> 205.20]  shows up powerfully in this community,
[205.42 --> 206.78]  in your home,
[206.78 --> 209.76]  in such a way that Sophia's heart is softened by grace
[209.76 --> 211.10]  and responds in faith
[211.10 --> 213.08]  because Jesus has that kind of power.
[215.28 --> 216.26]  Baptism is a gift.
[216.66 --> 218.54]  And we do believe for the rest of Sophia's life,
[218.62 --> 219.66]  she's invited to obedience,
[220.44 --> 221.74]  faith as she follows Jesus
[221.74 --> 223.48]  along with her parents in this church.
[224.46 --> 225.26]  So this time,
[225.30 --> 226.40]  I'm going to invite Derek and Nancy
[226.40 --> 227.48]  up onto the stage with me.
[228.00 --> 229.26]  And if you are a child,
[229.40 --> 230.84]  age three to grade three,
[230.94 --> 232.80]  you can sit right up on these steps here
[232.80 --> 234.20]  so you can be the front row seats
[234.20 --> 235.44]  to this beautiful sacrament.
[236.90 --> 237.82]  Even if you're visiting,
[237.92 --> 238.82]  all the children are welcome
[238.82 --> 239.98]  to sit on the stairs here.
[245.98 --> 246.72]  Let's just make sure
[246.72 --> 248.44]  we give the littlest ones a good spot.
[252.66 --> 253.24]  Come on up.
[253.24 --> 254.34]  You can sit right on the stairs.
[258.26 --> 258.96]  There we go.
[259.60 --> 260.90]  You might want to face this way.
[261.80 --> 262.74]  This is where it's happening.
[262.80 --> 267.18]  But you can wave to your moms and dads.
[267.70 --> 269.70]  Just a fun fact about Derek and Nancy.
[270.16 --> 271.44]  When I was a youth pastor,
[271.64 --> 272.88]  when I was still a kid myself,
[272.98 --> 274.78]  the very first visit I made
[274.78 --> 275.86]  was to Derek Braidfeld.
[276.44 --> 278.46]  And I also married Derek and Nancy
[278.46 --> 279.28]  a few years ago.
[279.44 --> 280.68]  And it is a privilege for me now
[280.68 --> 282.12]  to be baptizing little Sophia.
[282.26 --> 283.88]  I feel blessed and a privilege
[283.88 --> 284.92]  to be able to do this.
[286.38 --> 288.24]  Let me just show you for a moment, children,
[289.32 --> 291.30]  this very ordinary water.
[291.30 --> 293.60]  I've shown this to many kids
[293.60 --> 294.98]  and we're just going to put water
[294.98 --> 296.64]  over Sophia's head today.
[297.10 --> 298.36]  There's three ways of doing baptism.
[298.48 --> 299.24]  We could dunk her.
[300.28 --> 300.68]  No.
[301.08 --> 302.30]  But that's the way of saying
[302.30 --> 304.16]  that she died and rises with Jesus.
[304.58 --> 306.12]  We could pour water on her.
[306.20 --> 307.68]  In fact, that's how my kids were baptized
[307.68 --> 310.16]  because it shows the outpouring of the Spirit.
[310.16 --> 312.46]  But today we're just going to sprinkle Sophia
[312.46 --> 314.08]  and that means she's cleansed
[314.08 --> 315.28]  by the blood of Jesus.
[316.10 --> 317.28]  And every time we do baptism,
[317.48 --> 319.00]  we say to everyone who believes,
[319.42 --> 320.94]  this is God's way of saying to us,
[321.02 --> 321.72]  I love you.
[322.96 --> 324.84]  Follow me with the whole of your lives
[324.84 --> 327.08]  and stay close to my heart.
[327.18 --> 327.96]  Don't walk away
[327.96 --> 329.50]  because life is found in me.
[332.18 --> 332.54]  Ooh.
[332.90 --> 334.58]  You can talk to your cousin's parents
[334.58 --> 335.56]  about baptizing her.
[335.56 --> 339.16]  So if it's true
[339.16 --> 341.30]  that this child is only going to know
[341.30 --> 342.34]  the power and love of Jesus,
[343.58 --> 344.92]  it's going to be through your family.
[345.04 --> 345.94]  It's going to be through our church.
[346.72 --> 347.96]  And so I've got a number of questions
[347.96 --> 348.92]  for you, Derek and Nancy.
[349.12 --> 350.24]  I'm going to ask four questions
[350.24 --> 351.28]  and at the end of those,
[351.36 --> 352.46]  I'll invite you to respond.
[352.64 --> 353.14]  And after that,
[353.16 --> 354.10]  I have a question for us
[354.10 --> 355.08]  as the church family.
[356.14 --> 357.54]  So number one, Derek and Nancy,
[358.26 --> 359.36]  do you as parents
[359.36 --> 360.88]  believe in Jesus Christ
[360.88 --> 363.40]  as Lord and Savior and life?
[363.40 --> 365.70]  Secondly, do you believe
[365.70 --> 366.26]  that Sophia,
[366.50 --> 367.82]  as beautiful as she is,
[368.20 --> 369.26]  was born in sin
[369.26 --> 371.64]  and can only find salvation and life
[371.64 --> 372.46]  through the death
[372.46 --> 373.46]  and resurrection of Jesus?
[374.82 --> 375.38]  Thirdly,
[375.88 --> 377.80]  do you promise to raise little Sophia
[377.80 --> 380.24]  to know the living God?
[380.80 --> 382.32]  Will you model a life of repentance
[382.32 --> 383.14]  and faith
[383.14 --> 384.48]  and following Jesus yourselves?
[384.86 --> 386.46]  And will you teach her the scriptures,
[387.36 --> 388.20]  the way of prayer,
[388.78 --> 389.92]  and nurture her heart
[389.92 --> 391.02]  in the way of Christ?
[391.02 --> 391.74]  Finally,
[393.08 --> 394.58]  will you teach little Sophia
[394.58 --> 396.04]  that she belongs
[396.04 --> 397.86]  to the body of Christ,
[398.44 --> 399.44]  where her faith,
[399.52 --> 400.88]  her gifts can be nurtured,
[401.16 --> 402.40]  and where she can participate
[402.40 --> 403.28]  in God's mission
[403.28 --> 404.26]  in this city?
[404.98 --> 405.72]  Derek and Nancy,
[405.82 --> 406.46]  what is your answer?
[410.24 --> 411.54]  Hope I invite you to stand
[411.54 --> 412.94]  because I have a question for us
[412.94 --> 414.04]  as the wider believers.
[416.82 --> 418.20]  They say it takes a village
[418.20 --> 419.04]  to raise a child,
[419.12 --> 420.86]  and that is absolutely the case.
[420.86 --> 422.20]  When it comes to raising our children
[422.20 --> 423.36]  to know and follow Jesus.
[424.24 --> 425.12]  So Hope Community Church,
[425.18 --> 426.76]  will you pray for Derek and Nancy?
[427.28 --> 428.18]  Will you bless them,
[428.50 --> 429.00]  love them,
[429.22 --> 429.74]  serve them
[429.74 --> 431.02]  as God gives you opportunities
[431.02 --> 432.28]  so that all will grow
[432.28 --> 433.84]  in Christ and serve his kingdom?
[433.92 --> 434.64]  What is your answer?
[435.32 --> 435.98]  We do.
[436.42 --> 437.14]  God help us.
[437.48 --> 437.72]  Amen.
[437.92 --> 438.50]  You may be seated.
[438.50 --> 443.54]  All right, Nancy.
[443.54 --> 454.54]  Bring her right close.
[460.22 --> 462.60]  Sophia May Breitfeldt,
[463.30 --> 465.28]  I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[465.28 --> 468.06]  and the Son,
[468.66 --> 470.46]  and the Holy Spirit.
[471.66 --> 472.08]  Amen.
[482.66 --> 484.34]  Hope, will you join me in praying
[484.34 --> 486.36]  for the youngest member
[486.36 --> 487.86]  of our church family?
[487.86 --> 489.54]  And if you're able,
[489.68 --> 491.04]  I won't pray for a very long time
[491.04 --> 492.92]  because I want you to extend your arm
[492.92 --> 495.06]  in blessing and praying provision
[495.06 --> 496.30]  and protection over little Maya.
[496.38 --> 496.78]  Let's pray.
[498.36 --> 500.16]  Lord, we thank you for Sophia.
[501.74 --> 503.50]  And we begin by recognizing
[503.50 --> 504.62]  that she is fearfully
[504.62 --> 506.66]  and she is wonderfully made.
[507.30 --> 508.30]  You knit her together
[508.30 --> 509.12]  in her mother's womb,
[509.16 --> 511.14]  and we praise you for her life.
[511.14 --> 515.10]  We thank you for the promises
[515.10 --> 515.80]  of baptism.
[516.92 --> 518.20]  We thank you for the gift
[518.20 --> 519.98]  of being grafted into your family.
[520.86 --> 522.44]  We pray over her future.
[523.62 --> 524.78]  We ask that you would help her
[524.78 --> 525.66]  see her gifts,
[526.76 --> 528.12]  that you would nurture her heart,
[528.78 --> 529.46]  that you would give her
[529.46 --> 530.72]  the fruits of your spirit
[530.72 --> 532.22]  so that she would flourish
[532.22 --> 534.46]  as a servant of God.
[535.32 --> 536.80]  I pray over Derek and Nancy
[536.80 --> 537.28]  in their home
[537.28 --> 538.22]  that you give them everything
[538.22 --> 540.06]  they need to love her,
[540.06 --> 542.10]  to nurture her faith,
[542.46 --> 543.34]  to protect her
[543.34 --> 544.44]  and show her what it means
[544.44 --> 545.28]  to follow Jesus.
[546.26 --> 547.48]  Fill them with your spirit.
[548.30 --> 549.54]  Guide them by your strength.
[550.16 --> 551.04]  And Lord, we look forward
[551.04 --> 552.30]  to seeing Sophia grow up
[552.30 --> 553.52]  in this church family.
[554.36 --> 555.36]  We pray this all
[555.36 --> 557.02]  in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[557.34 --> 557.60]  Amen.
[560.60 --> 561.86]  So we've got some gifts
[561.86 --> 562.92]  for you, Derek and Nancy.
[564.32 --> 565.74]  First, as you've seen
[565.74 --> 566.74]  many times in our church,
[566.84 --> 568.00]  this is a baptism blanket.
[568.54 --> 570.04]  We hope she chews on this.
[570.28 --> 571.16]  She drools on this.
[571.26 --> 572.92]  Maybe even throws up on this.
[573.24 --> 574.52]  But it becomes a symbol
[574.52 --> 576.60]  where you can remind yourselves
[576.60 --> 577.76]  and her that she belongs
[577.76 --> 578.86]  to the family of Christ.
[579.56 --> 580.74]  We're also giving you
[580.74 --> 582.04]  the Jesus Storybook Bible,
[582.26 --> 583.96]  which I think is a phenomenal way
[583.96 --> 585.22]  to teach our kids the story.
[585.72 --> 587.34]  And inside this is a card
[587.34 --> 588.02]  from our leaders
[588.02 --> 589.44]  as well as a certificate
[589.44 --> 590.04]  of baptism.
[590.94 --> 591.74]  And the final gift
[591.74 --> 592.44]  that we're giving you,
[592.50 --> 593.54]  you'll be getting next week
[593.54 --> 594.82]  because we took photos
[594.82 --> 595.58]  of this event.
[596.18 --> 597.18]  A lot of pressure, by the way,
[597.22 --> 598.24]  because Nancy's a photographer,
[598.24 --> 599.04]  so hopefully it meets
[599.04 --> 599.50]  your standards.
[600.54 --> 601.86]  But we're going to frame that
[601.86 --> 603.36]  as well as a statement
[603.36 --> 604.46]  of what baptism's about.
[604.54 --> 605.72]  And we want you to put that photo
[605.72 --> 606.74]  in her bedroom
[606.74 --> 608.74]  so that as you go into a room,
[608.80 --> 609.92]  as she grows up in that room,
[609.98 --> 610.64]  it's a reminder
[610.64 --> 612.26]  that she is baptized in Christ,
[612.50 --> 613.56]  that she's part of the family,
[613.56 --> 614.78]  and she is loved.
[615.28 --> 615.98]  So congratulations,
[616.38 --> 616.98]  Derek and Nancy.
[617.36 --> 618.46]  Why don't we welcome them
[618.46 --> 618.96]  one more time
[618.96 --> 619.62]  with an applause
[619.62 --> 621.02]  and we praise the Lord.
[631.30 --> 632.64]  All right, Cornerstone children,
[632.78 --> 634.04]  you are invited upstairs
[634.04 --> 635.74]  to be discipled into the story.
[636.30 --> 637.12]  And I'm going to invite
[637.12 --> 637.84]  Jerry Ackerman
[637.84 --> 639.38]  to lead us in a community prayer.
[639.38 --> 639.50]  Thank you.
[639.50 --> 639.58]  Thank you.
[649.62 --> 658.42]  Having been a member of Hope
[658.42 --> 660.04]  since this was a field,
[660.30 --> 661.90]  and I remember standing here
[661.90 --> 664.20]  with the dirt under my feet,
[664.78 --> 666.40]  praying that this church
[666.40 --> 667.08]  would be built,
[667.78 --> 669.08]  I can say I've seen
[669.08 --> 670.16]  a lot of the kids
[670.16 --> 671.28]  grow up in Hope
[671.28 --> 673.18]  and been part of that journey
[673.18 --> 674.16]  and part of that community.
[674.84 --> 675.90]  And it's just great
[675.90 --> 676.60]  to come together
[676.60 --> 677.54]  as a community
[677.54 --> 679.02]  and to worship.
[679.62 --> 681.34]  Give thanks to the worship team
[681.34 --> 682.36]  who is so awesome
[682.36 --> 683.66]  in leading with their music.
[683.94 --> 684.78]  But I have to say,
[685.16 --> 686.10]  sitting up front,
[686.34 --> 687.84]  I'll recommend it to anyone.
[688.14 --> 690.12]  You all sound awesome as well
[690.12 --> 691.74]  as we do the worship here.
[693.08 --> 694.38]  Now that the kids are gone,
[695.44 --> 696.76]  let's calm our hearts
[696.76 --> 698.76]  and please join me
[698.76 --> 700.78]  as we together pray
[700.78 --> 701.56]  for our community.
[704.16 --> 706.96]  Father in heaven,
[707.14 --> 708.36]  we come before you
[708.36 --> 709.94]  in fellowship
[709.94 --> 711.72]  to sing praises to you
[711.72 --> 713.82]  and to recognize you
[713.82 --> 716.22]  as the one sovereign God.
[717.60 --> 719.80]  We ask that you fill this place
[719.80 --> 721.34]  and our homes
[721.34 --> 722.54]  with your Holy Spirit
[722.54 --> 723.70]  and that you continue
[723.70 --> 724.58]  to bless us.
[726.66 --> 729.20]  What an amazing summer it was
[729.20 --> 730.88]  with opportunities
[730.88 --> 731.92]  to get outdoors,
[732.52 --> 734.14]  experience all that you've made,
[734.16 --> 734.30]  made.
[734.98 --> 736.50]  We marvel at the beauty
[736.50 --> 737.04]  of it all
[737.04 --> 739.04]  and how wonderfully
[739.04 --> 740.98]  you've created all things.
[742.80 --> 743.58]  Lord God,
[743.64 --> 744.40]  we give thanks
[744.40 --> 745.76]  for the baptism
[745.76 --> 746.72]  of Sophia
[746.72 --> 748.86]  and the promise
[748.86 --> 749.66]  and the reminder
[749.66 --> 750.88]  that you're among us
[750.88 --> 752.14]  and that you love us.
[753.58 --> 754.78]  We give thanks
[754.78 --> 756.24]  for your endless providence.
[756.24 --> 758.52]  Lord, we thank you
[758.52 --> 759.82]  for our great nation.
[760.58 --> 761.50]  We thank you
[761.50 --> 762.62]  for Clayton community,
[763.12 --> 764.86]  for all the churches here.
[765.56 --> 766.50]  We give thanks
[766.50 --> 767.74]  for all the families here
[767.74 --> 769.72]  and for all the abundance
[769.72 --> 771.10]  that we have in our lives
[771.10 --> 773.20]  and for each person
[773.20 --> 774.10]  that you place
[774.10 --> 774.76]  in our lives.
[777.00 --> 778.14]  Lord, we pray
[778.14 --> 779.58]  for the indigenous communities
[779.58 --> 780.86]  that are around us
[780.86 --> 782.12]  and we ask
[782.12 --> 783.42]  for continued healing.
[783.42 --> 785.68]  We ask for peace
[785.68 --> 787.12]  and we ask
[787.12 --> 787.94]  for reconciliation,
[788.46 --> 788.56]  Lord,
[788.64 --> 789.58]  as we live together.
[791.54 --> 792.44]  Lord, we lift up
[792.44 --> 792.84]  the needs
[792.84 --> 793.96]  of our church family
[793.96 --> 796.14]  and our community
[796.14 --> 796.92]  around here.
[798.32 --> 798.76]  Lord,
[798.94 --> 800.04]  you are the healer.
[800.52 --> 801.50]  You are the teacher.
[802.86 --> 803.14]  Lord,
[803.20 --> 803.76]  you love us
[803.76 --> 804.96]  and you are a guiding light.
[804.96 --> 805.68]  Lord,
[805.68 --> 807.60]  we lift up those
[807.60 --> 808.22]  who are facing
[808.22 --> 809.18]  health challenges,
[809.42 --> 809.56]  Lord,
[810.04 --> 811.32]  and we ask for healing.
[813.40 --> 814.56]  We lift up those,
[814.68 --> 814.80]  Lord,
[814.86 --> 815.54]  who are struggling
[815.54 --> 817.40]  with their employment situation.
[818.16 --> 818.92]  We pray
[818.92 --> 819.76]  that the unemployed
[819.76 --> 820.72]  will find work.
[821.50 --> 821.96]  We pray
[821.96 --> 822.88]  that in our work
[822.88 --> 824.14]  that we may find
[824.14 --> 824.80]  opportunities
[824.80 --> 826.02]  to glorify you
[826.02 --> 827.64]  in all of our actions
[827.64 --> 828.92]  and interactions.
[831.16 --> 831.64]  Lord,
[831.74 --> 832.76]  there may be some here
[832.76 --> 833.46]  who are facing
[833.46 --> 834.78]  very difficult decisions.
[834.96 --> 837.50]  whether it's workload
[837.50 --> 838.74]  or balance,
[839.28 --> 840.70]  life balance,
[841.62 --> 842.32]  perhaps it's
[842.32 --> 843.14]  within relationships
[843.14 --> 844.84]  or it's choosing
[844.84 --> 845.72]  the next direction.
[846.36 --> 847.00]  We pray,
[847.18 --> 847.22]  Lord,
[847.28 --> 848.38]  that you'll help guide us.
[849.52 --> 850.24]  We ask you,
[850.34 --> 850.76]  Lord Jesus,
[850.84 --> 851.72]  to walk with us
[851.72 --> 852.88]  and to be near us
[852.88 --> 853.84]  as we struggle
[853.84 --> 854.68]  in conflict.
[856.62 --> 857.64]  May you help us
[857.64 --> 858.56]  to be peacemakers,
[858.78 --> 858.92]  Lord.
[860.30 --> 860.78]  Lord,
[860.84 --> 861.24]  we pray
[861.24 --> 861.96]  and we lift up
[861.96 --> 862.64]  our students
[862.64 --> 863.96]  who have started school
[863.96 --> 865.62]  including those
[865.62 --> 866.28]  who have gone off
[866.28 --> 866.82]  to college
[866.82 --> 867.62]  and university.
[869.34 --> 870.12]  Lord Jesus,
[870.24 --> 871.36]  we ask that you guide
[871.36 --> 872.30]  and protect them.
[873.18 --> 874.48]  We pray for encouragement
[874.48 --> 875.12]  for them
[875.12 --> 876.84]  and that you give them
[876.84 --> 877.54]  the knowledge
[877.54 --> 878.40]  that they seek.
[879.88 --> 881.16]  In the name of Jesus,
[881.82 --> 883.42]  we ask that you empower
[883.42 --> 884.26]  each of us
[884.26 --> 885.26]  as we strive
[885.26 --> 886.92]  to make a place here,
[887.70 --> 888.68]  a place where people
[888.68 --> 889.38]  can become
[889.38 --> 890.62]  so belong,
[890.62 --> 891.98]  where they can believe
[891.98 --> 892.74]  and become
[892.74 --> 894.20]  part of this community,
[894.40 --> 894.52]  Lord.
[896.30 --> 897.80]  We pray that Clayton Heights
[897.80 --> 898.36]  will know
[898.36 --> 899.58]  that Hope Church
[899.58 --> 901.30]  is where Christians
[901.30 --> 902.04]  will know us
[902.04 --> 902.70]  by our love.
[903.78 --> 905.10]  We pray for the leadership
[905.10 --> 905.88]  of this church,
[906.10 --> 906.26]  Lord,
[906.38 --> 907.16]  and the leaders
[907.16 --> 907.92]  in our community.
[909.66 --> 909.90]  Lord,
[910.10 --> 911.40]  please give them wisdom
[911.40 --> 913.42]  as they make decisions
[913.42 --> 914.44]  to care for
[914.44 --> 915.42]  and to love
[915.42 --> 916.20]  your church
[916.20 --> 916.94]  and your people.
[918.20 --> 919.00]  Please prepare
[919.00 --> 919.52]  our hearts,
[919.68 --> 919.84]  Lord,
[920.16 --> 921.90]  as we are about
[921.90 --> 922.74]  to hear your word
[922.74 --> 924.10]  and bless Pastor Dave.
[925.30 --> 926.06]  We ask this
[926.06 --> 926.42]  in the name
[926.42 --> 926.98]  of the Father
[926.98 --> 928.28]  and the Son
[928.28 --> 929.50]  and the Holy Spirit.
[930.42 --> 930.74]  Amen.
[933.74 --> 934.64]  At this time,
[934.72 --> 935.32]  we would have
[935.32 --> 936.08]  an offering,
[936.72 --> 938.82]  but we do that
[938.82 --> 939.58]  digitally now.
[939.80 --> 940.38]  And so there is
[940.38 --> 941.24]  a QR code
[941.24 --> 941.98]  in your bulletin
[941.98 --> 942.86]  and we have an app
[942.86 --> 943.70]  for online giving.
[944.24 --> 944.62]  Also,
[944.72 --> 945.54]  after the service,
[945.68 --> 946.72]  there's a machine there
[946.72 --> 947.10]  if you'd like
[947.10 --> 947.64]  to give there.
[947.64 --> 948.66]  You can do it
[948.66 --> 949.40]  any time of the week
[949.40 --> 950.38]  using the electronics.
[950.72 --> 952.10]  But the money
[952.10 --> 953.50]  that comes in
[953.50 --> 954.12]  through the offering,
[954.24 --> 954.72]  for those of you
[954.72 --> 955.24]  who don't know,
[955.52 --> 956.46]  it goes beyond
[956.46 --> 957.34]  just putting lights
[957.34 --> 958.24]  on in the church
[958.24 --> 959.16]  or paying for the heat
[959.16 --> 960.26]  or the staff.
[961.40 --> 962.78]  Some of those funds
[962.78 --> 963.90]  go towards the deacons
[963.90 --> 965.28]  who are listening
[965.28 --> 966.16]  to our community
[966.16 --> 967.68]  and helping those
[967.68 --> 968.28]  that are in need.
[968.62 --> 969.06]  Thank you.
[969.06 --> 969.12]  Thank you.
[969.12 --> 969.16]  Thank you.
[969.16 --> 970.16]  Thank you.
[970.16 --> 971.16]  Thank you.
[971.16 --> 971.22]  Thank you.
[971.22 --> 972.16]  Thank you.
[972.16 --> 973.16]  Thank you.
[973.16 --> 973.22]  Thank you.
[973.22 --> 974.16]  Thank you.
[974.16 --> 975.16]  Thank you.
[975.16 --> 975.22]  Thank you.
[975.22 --> 975.28]  Thank you.
[975.28 --> 976.16]  Thank you.
[976.16 --> 977.16]  Thank you.
[977.64 --> 978.64]  Thank you.
[978.64 --> 979.64]  Thank you.
[979.64 --> 980.64]  Well, we are going to continue
[980.64 --> 981.60]  our sermon series
[981.60 --> 982.66]  called Homegrown.
[982.66 --> 984.54]  And over the last three weeks,
[984.54 --> 985.20]  we've been looking
[985.20 --> 986.58]  at what does it look like
[986.58 --> 987.50]  to live out the gospel
[987.50 --> 988.94]  in the most ordinary space
[988.94 --> 990.16]  that is our homes?
[990.50 --> 991.72]  How do we bring
[991.72 --> 992.90]  what we believe about Jesus
[992.90 --> 994.66]  to the ordinary relationships
[994.66 --> 995.72]  under your roof,
[995.98 --> 997.96]  the ordinary life of marriage?
[997.96 --> 998.90]  And today,
[998.90 --> 1000.18]  we are going to be looking
[1000.18 --> 1001.86]  at the overwhelming,
[1002.16 --> 1002.38]  daunting,
[1002.50 --> 1003.38]  and beautiful task
[1003.38 --> 1004.10]  of parenting.
[1004.10 --> 1005.98]  And I will say,
[1006.10 --> 1006.74]  writing the sermon
[1006.74 --> 1007.80]  was personally challenging
[1007.80 --> 1008.44]  for me.
[1009.18 --> 1010.20]  But if you have your Bible,
[1010.36 --> 1011.18]  I invite you to turn with me
[1011.18 --> 1012.54]  to Ephesians chapter 6.
[1012.78 --> 1013.60]  We're going to continue
[1013.60 --> 1014.94]  actually right off
[1014.94 --> 1015.74]  where Pastor Sid
[1015.74 --> 1016.84]  left us last week
[1016.84 --> 1017.58]  when he was preaching
[1017.58 --> 1018.24]  on marriage.
[1019.26 --> 1020.42]  This is Ephesians 6,
[1020.66 --> 1021.60]  1 to 4.
[1023.28 --> 1024.16]  I really like
[1024.16 --> 1025.04]  how this one starts.
[1025.04 --> 1027.58]  Children,
[1027.86 --> 1028.86]  obey your parents
[1028.86 --> 1029.52]  in the Lord,
[1030.24 --> 1031.74]  for this is right.
[1032.48 --> 1033.32]  Honor your father
[1033.32 --> 1034.04]  and your mother,
[1034.56 --> 1035.72]  which is the first commandment
[1035.72 --> 1036.48]  with a promise,
[1036.90 --> 1038.04]  so that it may go well
[1038.04 --> 1038.54]  with you
[1038.54 --> 1039.76]  and that you may enjoy
[1039.76 --> 1040.62]  a long life
[1040.62 --> 1041.28]  on the earth.
[1042.52 --> 1042.90]  Fathers,
[1043.36 --> 1044.74]  do not exasperate
[1044.74 --> 1045.22]  your children.
[1046.08 --> 1046.44]  Instead,
[1047.14 --> 1048.04]  bring them up
[1048.04 --> 1048.82]  in the training
[1048.82 --> 1049.88]  and the instruction
[1049.88 --> 1051.06]  of the Lord.
[1051.06 --> 1051.22]  Amen.
[1055.04 --> 1057.12]  Well, a few years ago now,
[1057.20 --> 1058.50]  I was attending a conference.
[1058.76 --> 1060.02]  It was a church leaders conference
[1060.02 --> 1061.52]  and the focus of the conference
[1061.52 --> 1063.08]  was on outreach
[1063.08 --> 1064.06]  and evangelism.
[1064.60 --> 1065.82]  And throughout that weekend
[1065.82 --> 1066.60]  that I was there,
[1066.72 --> 1067.72]  there were so many stories
[1067.72 --> 1068.48]  of how churches
[1068.48 --> 1069.48]  were engaging their city,
[1069.62 --> 1070.18]  how they're caring
[1070.18 --> 1070.62]  for the needs
[1070.62 --> 1071.18]  of their neighbors.
[1071.58 --> 1072.54]  It was very moving.
[1073.46 --> 1074.72]  But what I remember the most
[1074.72 --> 1075.60]  about this conference
[1075.60 --> 1076.82]  is an older gentleman
[1076.82 --> 1077.44]  who was speaking
[1077.44 --> 1078.50]  near the end of the conference
[1078.50 --> 1080.40]  and he's sharing stories
[1080.40 --> 1080.96]  and then he said,
[1081.02 --> 1081.46]  you know what?
[1081.80 --> 1082.36]  All weekend,
[1082.44 --> 1083.00]  we've been hearing
[1083.00 --> 1083.98]  amazing stories
[1083.98 --> 1084.50]  of how churches
[1084.50 --> 1085.54]  are engaging their cities.
[1085.74 --> 1087.14]  But I want to share with you
[1087.14 --> 1088.04]  a concern,
[1088.20 --> 1089.34]  a burden of my heart
[1089.34 --> 1090.74]  and this is what he said.
[1091.54 --> 1092.82]  If we do all these
[1092.82 --> 1093.74]  exciting ministries
[1093.74 --> 1094.52]  in the city
[1094.52 --> 1096.64]  at the expense
[1096.64 --> 1098.58]  of raising our children
[1098.58 --> 1099.84]  to follow Jesus,
[1100.74 --> 1102.94]  we have lost the plot.
[1104.16 --> 1105.22]  And for the next 10 minutes,
[1105.30 --> 1105.98]  he just exhorted
[1105.98 --> 1106.94]  all the young parents
[1106.94 --> 1107.38]  who were there
[1107.38 --> 1108.02]  at this conference
[1108.02 --> 1109.40]  to sacrificially
[1109.40 --> 1110.36]  and generously
[1110.36 --> 1111.50]  create space
[1111.50 --> 1113.02]  to disciple their children
[1113.02 --> 1114.26]  to know Jesus.
[1114.50 --> 1114.96]  And you could hear
[1114.96 --> 1115.64]  a pin drop
[1115.64 --> 1116.32]  in the room
[1116.32 --> 1116.90]  because we felt
[1116.90 --> 1117.74]  such deep conviction
[1117.74 --> 1119.14]  by what he was saying.
[1120.10 --> 1120.84]  But I want to widen
[1120.84 --> 1121.86]  the scope of what he said
[1121.86 --> 1122.70]  because it was so deep
[1122.70 --> 1123.58]  not just for pastors
[1123.58 --> 1124.16]  and church leaders
[1124.16 --> 1125.58]  but for every single parent
[1125.58 --> 1126.54]  who's raising children
[1126.54 --> 1128.48]  that the calling we have
[1128.48 --> 1129.28]  to serve Jesus
[1129.28 --> 1130.04]  with our work
[1130.04 --> 1130.68]  from framing
[1130.68 --> 1131.46]  to finance
[1131.46 --> 1132.34]  and all the rest,
[1132.70 --> 1133.54]  all that good work
[1133.54 --> 1134.48]  that God sends us
[1134.48 --> 1135.22]  in the world to do
[1135.22 --> 1137.02]  must never overshadow
[1137.02 --> 1138.80]  or eclipse
[1138.80 --> 1141.20]  the glorious calling
[1141.20 --> 1142.86]  to raise our children
[1142.86 --> 1144.48]  to know God
[1144.48 --> 1145.54]  and to follow Jesus.
[1146.24 --> 1147.82]  When God gives us children,
[1148.24 --> 1149.32]  they are a gift.
[1149.98 --> 1151.62]  They truly are a gift.
[1151.62 --> 1153.56]  But he also gives with us
[1153.56 --> 1154.66]  that responsibility,
[1154.92 --> 1155.42]  the daunting
[1155.42 --> 1157.96]  and beautiful responsibility
[1157.96 --> 1160.16]  to form those young hearts
[1160.16 --> 1161.76]  to respond
[1161.76 --> 1163.58]  to God's grace.
[1165.16 --> 1166.36]  Now in Ephesians 6,
[1166.46 --> 1167.68]  there's sort of two halves to it.
[1167.72 --> 1168.42]  The first half
[1168.42 --> 1170.48]  is Paul addressing children.
[1171.42 --> 1172.32]  And so junior youth
[1172.32 --> 1173.22]  who are here,
[1173.28 --> 1173.84]  I just want to say
[1173.84 --> 1174.90]  this is a great Sunday
[1174.90 --> 1176.54]  for having your sermon notes.
[1176.68 --> 1177.50]  Take really good notes.
[1177.60 --> 1178.26]  Bring them to the table
[1178.26 --> 1178.98]  when you get to lunch
[1178.98 --> 1179.54]  this afternoon.
[1180.02 --> 1181.14]  And the second half
[1181.14 --> 1182.04]  addresses parents.
[1182.12 --> 1182.64]  And we can take
[1182.64 --> 1183.34]  our sermon notes
[1183.34 --> 1183.84]  and take those
[1183.84 --> 1184.28]  to the table
[1184.28 --> 1185.44]  this afternoon as well.
[1185.98 --> 1186.88]  But we'll look at it
[1186.88 --> 1187.32]  in the order
[1187.32 --> 1188.66]  that Paul gives his instruction.
[1189.44 --> 1190.46]  This is how he starts.
[1191.18 --> 1191.46]  Children,
[1191.76 --> 1192.74]  obey your parents
[1192.74 --> 1193.36]  in the Lord
[1193.36 --> 1194.28]  for this is right.
[1195.04 --> 1196.06]  Honor your father
[1196.06 --> 1196.72]  and your mother
[1196.72 --> 1198.08]  which is the first commandment
[1198.08 --> 1198.84]  with a promise
[1198.84 --> 1201.08]  so that it may go well for you
[1201.08 --> 1202.38]  and that you may enjoy
[1202.38 --> 1204.76]  long life on the earth.
[1205.86 --> 1206.92]  Now these words
[1206.92 --> 1208.76]  are very contextual words.
[1209.60 --> 1210.22]  Pastor Sid touched
[1210.22 --> 1210.94]  on this last week
[1210.94 --> 1211.72]  but I'll remind us
[1211.72 --> 1213.06]  that in the context
[1213.06 --> 1213.90]  that he's writing
[1213.90 --> 1214.92]  there was what's called
[1214.92 --> 1215.86]  a household code.
[1216.04 --> 1217.38]  Romans and Jewish people
[1217.38 --> 1218.52]  had a sense of like
[1218.52 --> 1219.72]  this is how the home
[1219.72 --> 1220.72]  is supposed to run.
[1221.14 --> 1222.38]  And in the Roman context
[1222.38 --> 1223.38]  which is Ephesus
[1223.38 --> 1224.18]  a Roman colony
[1224.18 --> 1225.76]  the way they understood
[1225.76 --> 1226.90]  household code was
[1226.90 --> 1230.14]  the dad has all the power.
[1231.08 --> 1231.98]  Doesn't matter how old
[1231.98 --> 1232.48]  the kids are
[1232.48 --> 1234.20]  what dad says goes.
[1234.84 --> 1235.96]  And Paul's aware of that
[1235.96 --> 1236.96]  as he's writing this
[1236.96 --> 1238.16]  and notice what Paul says.
[1239.14 --> 1239.50]  Children,
[1239.70 --> 1242.28]  obey your parents
[1242.28 --> 1243.54]  thanks in the Lord.
[1244.64 --> 1245.66]  And one of the commentators
[1245.66 --> 1246.34]  on this passage
[1246.34 --> 1246.84]  he says you know
[1246.84 --> 1247.74]  the gospel is always
[1247.74 --> 1248.58]  good news for children
[1248.58 --> 1249.56]  and it's always good news
[1249.56 --> 1249.98]  for women.
[1250.10 --> 1250.88]  And I just want to say
[1250.88 --> 1252.26]  children are invited
[1252.26 --> 1253.76]  to obey not just their dad
[1253.76 --> 1254.90]  but their mom.
[1255.40 --> 1256.72]  And we praise the Lord
[1256.72 --> 1257.22]  for that.
[1257.70 --> 1258.42]  You know I'm sure
[1258.42 --> 1259.24]  I'm not the only dad
[1259.24 --> 1259.84]  in this room
[1259.84 --> 1261.10]  who's had his
[1261.10 --> 1262.56]  low moments of parenting
[1262.56 --> 1263.68]  where things have been said
[1263.68 --> 1264.38]  and you're trying to
[1264.38 --> 1265.34]  elicit response
[1265.34 --> 1265.90]  from your children
[1265.90 --> 1266.88]  and it's not going well
[1266.88 --> 1267.76]  and then your wife
[1267.76 --> 1268.70]  comes into the room
[1268.70 --> 1269.56]  and it's going
[1269.56 --> 1270.18]  a lot better.
[1270.84 --> 1271.68]  She says things
[1271.68 --> 1272.10]  in a way
[1272.10 --> 1272.92]  that's a little better
[1272.92 --> 1273.48]  and healthier
[1273.48 --> 1274.14]  and all of a sudden
[1274.14 --> 1275.16]  the children are responding
[1275.16 --> 1275.94]  in a healthier way.
[1276.26 --> 1277.14]  Praise the Lord
[1277.14 --> 1278.74]  that moms
[1278.74 --> 1280.28]  are part of the equation
[1280.28 --> 1280.94]  when it comes to
[1280.94 --> 1282.28]  forming young hearts.
[1283.84 --> 1284.28]  Secondly,
[1284.84 --> 1285.92]  notice what Paul adds
[1285.92 --> 1286.42]  after that.
[1286.56 --> 1286.74]  Honor,
[1287.30 --> 1287.54]  sorry,
[1287.60 --> 1288.52]  obey your parents
[1288.52 --> 1289.94]  in the Lord.
[1290.74 --> 1291.78]  That is such
[1291.78 --> 1292.74]  a critical statement.
[1292.94 --> 1293.78]  Paul is not saying
[1293.78 --> 1294.54]  that children have to
[1294.54 --> 1295.24]  obey their parents
[1295.24 --> 1296.00]  carte blanche.
[1296.54 --> 1297.08]  He's not saying
[1297.08 --> 1298.00]  that parents can ask
[1298.00 --> 1298.64]  their kids to do
[1298.64 --> 1299.26]  whatever they want.
[1299.54 --> 1300.06]  They are called
[1300.06 --> 1301.36]  to instruct their children
[1301.36 --> 1302.60]  in the Lord
[1302.60 --> 1304.16]  and that means
[1304.16 --> 1305.12]  very importantly
[1305.12 --> 1306.14]  that there's an authority
[1306.14 --> 1307.56]  above mom and dad
[1307.56 --> 1309.24]  whose instruction
[1309.24 --> 1310.92]  trumps mom and dad
[1310.92 --> 1312.88]  and there are situations
[1312.88 --> 1313.84]  sometimes they're
[1313.84 --> 1314.48]  heart-wrenching
[1314.48 --> 1315.84]  where children can hear
[1315.84 --> 1316.42]  an instruction
[1316.42 --> 1317.12]  from mom and dad
[1317.12 --> 1317.96]  or they can be told
[1317.96 --> 1318.66]  to do something
[1318.66 --> 1319.46]  by dad or mom
[1319.46 --> 1320.70]  and they can legitimately
[1320.70 --> 1321.76]  if they know the words
[1321.76 --> 1323.78]  say that is not
[1323.78 --> 1324.64]  to be listened to
[1324.64 --> 1326.04]  because there is
[1326.04 --> 1327.06]  a higher authority
[1327.06 --> 1328.10]  that says
[1328.10 --> 1328.72]  this is the way
[1328.72 --> 1329.12]  I'm supposed
[1329.12 --> 1329.96]  to live my life.
[1331.42 --> 1332.20]  And this is a bit
[1332.20 --> 1332.82]  of a sidebar
[1332.82 --> 1333.56]  but I think it's always
[1333.56 --> 1334.28]  a healthy thing
[1334.28 --> 1335.16]  if you're a young adult
[1335.16 --> 1335.82]  or you're sort of
[1335.82 --> 1336.44]  emerging adult
[1336.44 --> 1337.74]  whatever that category means
[1337.74 --> 1339.18]  and you are still
[1339.18 --> 1339.68]  under the roof
[1339.68 --> 1340.26]  of your parents
[1340.26 --> 1340.72]  and you're listening
[1340.72 --> 1341.26]  to their teaching
[1341.26 --> 1342.16]  it is always a healthy
[1342.16 --> 1342.90]  thing to be asking
[1342.90 --> 1343.68]  yourself not just
[1343.68 --> 1344.90]  what do mom and dad
[1344.90 --> 1345.96]  think about this
[1345.96 --> 1347.36]  but to be asking
[1347.36 --> 1348.16]  what does Christ
[1348.16 --> 1348.96]  by his word
[1348.96 --> 1350.22]  say about this
[1350.22 --> 1350.72]  and I think that's
[1350.72 --> 1351.32]  just a statement
[1351.32 --> 1351.88]  of maturing
[1351.88 --> 1352.62]  saying it's no longer
[1352.62 --> 1353.20]  just mom and dad
[1353.20 --> 1354.10]  it's I want to know
[1354.10 --> 1354.98]  what Jesus Christ
[1354.98 --> 1355.80]  by his word
[1355.80 --> 1356.98]  have for me
[1356.98 --> 1358.10]  in this stage of life
[1358.10 --> 1359.02]  because that is
[1359.02 --> 1359.84]  my discipleship
[1359.84 --> 1360.62]  that is obedience.
[1362.52 --> 1363.66]  Now Paul immediately
[1363.66 --> 1365.36]  touches this teaching
[1365.36 --> 1366.68]  to the fifth commandment
[1366.68 --> 1367.94]  which is Exodus 20
[1367.94 --> 1368.84]  the Old Testament
[1368.84 --> 1370.12]  there's ten commandments
[1370.12 --> 1371.12]  and the fifth commandment
[1371.12 --> 1372.74]  is honor your father
[1372.74 --> 1373.52]  and your mother
[1373.52 --> 1375.02]  which is the first commandment
[1375.02 --> 1375.72]  with a promise.
[1376.78 --> 1377.66]  And I think it's a really
[1377.66 --> 1378.38]  important question
[1378.38 --> 1379.46]  at every stage
[1379.46 --> 1380.78]  when we are children
[1380.78 --> 1381.86]  whether we're adult children
[1381.86 --> 1382.64]  or young children
[1382.64 --> 1383.86]  what in the world
[1383.86 --> 1384.42]  does it mean
[1384.42 --> 1386.16]  to honor my mom
[1386.16 --> 1387.16]  and my dad?
[1388.38 --> 1388.84]  Well scripture
[1388.84 --> 1389.92]  gives a lot of rich nuance
[1389.92 --> 1390.38]  to that
[1390.38 --> 1391.02]  and I would say
[1391.02 --> 1391.90]  the words actually
[1391.90 --> 1392.60]  in the Old Testament
[1392.60 --> 1393.32]  can be translated
[1393.32 --> 1394.28]  to revere
[1394.28 --> 1395.46]  sounds pretty good
[1395.46 --> 1396.16]  doesn't it parents?
[1396.50 --> 1396.86]  Revere
[1396.86 --> 1398.04]  children revere you
[1398.04 --> 1399.92]  they respect you
[1399.92 --> 1401.32]  and by respect
[1401.32 --> 1402.02]  I mean not just
[1402.02 --> 1402.82]  as people
[1402.82 --> 1404.16]  but your position
[1404.16 --> 1406.42]  this is such a deep teaching
[1406.42 --> 1407.06]  but think about this
[1407.06 --> 1407.38]  for a minute
[1407.38 --> 1410.38]  God gave you
[1410.38 --> 1411.84]  certain parents
[1411.84 --> 1413.52]  Sophia this morning
[1413.52 --> 1414.18]  oh she's gone
[1414.18 --> 1414.90]  that's how she felt
[1414.90 --> 1415.44]  about the sermon
[1415.44 --> 1416.38]  she left
[1416.38 --> 1418.98]  Sophia has been placed
[1418.98 --> 1420.16]  under the care
[1420.16 --> 1421.74]  of Derek and Nancy
[1421.74 --> 1423.36]  they have been given
[1423.36 --> 1424.14]  the responsibility
[1424.14 --> 1425.30]  to teach her
[1425.30 --> 1426.48]  to instruct her
[1426.48 --> 1427.50]  to put boundaries
[1427.50 --> 1428.56]  around her life
[1428.56 --> 1429.52]  to play with her
[1429.52 --> 1429.98]  and yes
[1429.98 --> 1431.44]  even to discipline her
[1431.44 --> 1433.18]  in the way of Christ
[1433.18 --> 1434.82]  and that is a unique
[1434.82 --> 1435.88]  privilege and position
[1435.88 --> 1436.80]  that God has given them
[1436.80 --> 1437.84]  and every parent
[1437.84 --> 1439.04]  is given that
[1439.04 --> 1439.90]  and children are to
[1439.90 --> 1441.60]  honor and respect
[1441.60 --> 1442.70]  that unique position
[1442.70 --> 1443.54]  that parents have
[1443.54 --> 1446.22]  an author I quite like
[1446.22 --> 1446.86]  he said this
[1446.86 --> 1448.00]  on Ephesians 6
[1448.00 --> 1448.28]  he says
[1448.28 --> 1448.92]  you know we honor
[1448.92 --> 1449.70]  our parents
[1449.70 --> 1451.00]  not because
[1451.00 --> 1451.92]  they are the wisest
[1451.92 --> 1452.68]  or the fairest
[1452.68 --> 1455.18]  we honor our parents
[1455.18 --> 1456.16]  because they are
[1456.16 --> 1456.64]  the parents
[1456.64 --> 1458.08]  that God has given us
[1458.08 --> 1459.88]  and it's assumed
[1459.88 --> 1460.78]  by Paul here
[1460.78 --> 1461.94]  that obedience
[1461.94 --> 1462.52]  and honor
[1462.52 --> 1463.12]  includes
[1463.12 --> 1464.20]  listening well
[1464.20 --> 1464.90]  to the instruction
[1464.90 --> 1465.48]  they give
[1465.48 --> 1466.84]  not constantly
[1466.84 --> 1467.74]  challenging it
[1467.74 --> 1468.90]  not constantly
[1468.90 --> 1470.12]  rolling your eyes
[1470.12 --> 1470.86]  when your parents
[1470.86 --> 1471.52]  give a boundary
[1471.52 --> 1472.02]  that you think
[1472.02 --> 1472.52]  is unfair
[1472.52 --> 1473.54]  and all your friends
[1473.54 --> 1474.08]  have the thing
[1474.08 --> 1474.66]  that you don't get
[1474.66 --> 1475.14]  to have
[1475.14 --> 1476.34]  it's respecting
[1476.34 --> 1477.62]  the God given
[1477.62 --> 1478.22]  authority
[1478.22 --> 1479.66]  that they have
[1479.66 --> 1480.70]  in your life
[1480.70 --> 1483.76]  now I want to note
[1483.76 --> 1484.26]  this is again
[1484.26 --> 1485.00]  a bit of a sidebar
[1485.00 --> 1486.28]  but I can't not say it
[1486.28 --> 1487.30]  Daryl Johnson
[1487.30 --> 1487.94]  in his work
[1487.94 --> 1488.82]  on the Ten Commandments
[1488.82 --> 1489.88]  says that this has
[1489.88 --> 1490.52]  this passage
[1490.52 --> 1491.60]  has a lot to say
[1491.60 --> 1493.18]  to adult kids
[1493.18 --> 1494.32]  so those of you
[1494.32 --> 1494.88]  who are adults
[1494.88 --> 1495.50]  and your parents
[1495.50 --> 1496.32]  are still alive
[1496.32 --> 1497.66]  we still have to work
[1497.66 --> 1498.42]  out what does it mean
[1498.42 --> 1499.04]  to honor them
[1499.04 --> 1500.16]  now that I'm grown up
[1500.16 --> 1501.08]  in some sense
[1501.08 --> 1502.06]  and my parents
[1502.06 --> 1503.00]  have grown up
[1503.00 --> 1503.84]  in some sense
[1503.84 --> 1505.14]  and Daryl Johnson
[1505.14 --> 1505.76]  suggests
[1505.76 --> 1507.16]  that the calling
[1507.16 --> 1508.24]  of adult kids
[1508.24 --> 1509.50]  is to care
[1509.50 --> 1510.88]  for their parents
[1510.88 --> 1512.60]  and I'll just read
[1512.60 --> 1512.92]  a quote
[1512.92 --> 1513.72]  it's not on the screen
[1513.72 --> 1514.34]  but this one
[1514.34 --> 1515.76]  this always affects me
[1515.76 --> 1516.84]  as I think of my own parents
[1516.84 --> 1517.30]  he says
[1517.30 --> 1518.78]  look how your parents
[1518.78 --> 1520.22]  sacrifice their lifestyle
[1520.22 --> 1520.96]  for you
[1520.96 --> 1522.30]  for 10, 20
[1522.30 --> 1522.70]  and I'd add
[1522.70 --> 1523.92]  even 30 years
[1523.92 --> 1525.44]  isn't it only fair
[1525.44 --> 1526.14]  that we return
[1526.14 --> 1527.26]  a decade or two
[1527.26 --> 1528.28]  of care for them
[1528.28 --> 1529.84]  we stifled
[1529.84 --> 1530.96]  their lifestyle
[1530.96 --> 1531.82]  with dirty diapers
[1531.82 --> 1533.96]  messing eating habits
[1533.96 --> 1535.32]  and endless crying
[1535.32 --> 1535.94]  at night
[1535.94 --> 1537.82]  isn't it only fair
[1537.82 --> 1539.10]  to return the gift
[1539.10 --> 1540.82]  of being inconvenienced
[1540.82 --> 1542.34]  they pushed us
[1542.34 --> 1543.26]  in strollers
[1543.26 --> 1544.12]  ought we not
[1544.12 --> 1544.86]  to push them
[1544.86 --> 1546.12]  in wheelchairs
[1546.12 --> 1548.96]  honor your father
[1548.96 --> 1550.24]  her and your mother
[1550.24 --> 1552.10]  now interestingly
[1552.10 --> 1553.38]  notice what Paul says
[1553.38 --> 1554.16]  right after that
[1554.16 --> 1555.30]  first commandment
[1555.30 --> 1556.62]  with a promise
[1556.62 --> 1557.94]  so that it may go well
[1557.94 --> 1558.30]  with you
[1558.30 --> 1559.36]  and that you may enjoy
[1559.36 --> 1560.84]  a long life on the earth
[1560.84 --> 1561.66]  the payoff
[1561.66 --> 1563.02]  of obedience
[1563.02 --> 1564.12]  and honoring our parents
[1564.12 --> 1565.36]  is blessing
[1565.36 --> 1566.96]  and it doesn't mean
[1566.96 --> 1567.28]  by the way
[1567.28 --> 1567.80]  that you're going to live
[1567.80 --> 1569.32]  120 if you obey your parents
[1569.32 --> 1570.14]  I mean maybe that's
[1570.14 --> 1570.80]  going to be the case
[1570.80 --> 1571.38]  for some of us
[1571.38 --> 1572.94]  but what Paul means by that
[1572.94 --> 1574.02]  is you're going to flourish
[1574.02 --> 1575.68]  when you have good
[1575.68 --> 1576.44]  godly parents
[1576.44 --> 1577.74]  giving good godly instruction
[1577.74 --> 1579.04]  and you take hold of those
[1579.04 --> 1579.68]  and you live in them
[1579.68 --> 1580.98]  there's a really good chance
[1580.98 --> 1581.74]  you're going to avoid
[1581.74 --> 1582.68]  destructive habits
[1582.68 --> 1584.14]  that ruin your life
[1584.14 --> 1585.32]  you're going to avoid
[1585.32 --> 1586.36]  pitfalls of behavior
[1586.36 --> 1587.52]  that will leave a trail
[1587.52 --> 1588.76]  of pain in your relationships
[1588.76 --> 1590.08]  you're going to make decisions
[1590.08 --> 1591.40]  that honor God
[1591.40 --> 1591.86]  and you're going to
[1591.86 --> 1593.40]  experience blessing
[1593.40 --> 1594.66]  it doesn't mean your life
[1594.66 --> 1595.60]  will be absent of pain
[1595.60 --> 1597.10]  but there is always blessing
[1597.10 --> 1598.90]  when we obey good instructions
[1598.90 --> 1599.64]  that bring us
[1599.64 --> 1600.50]  in the way of Christ
[1600.50 --> 1604.36]  and now we shift
[1604.36 --> 1605.88]  to what Paul has to say
[1605.88 --> 1606.54]  to parents
[1606.54 --> 1608.80]  and don't miss that
[1608.80 --> 1609.68]  the first thing he says
[1609.68 --> 1610.78]  to parents is to dads
[1610.78 --> 1612.34]  so mom's going to pass on this
[1612.34 --> 1613.06]  not very fair
[1613.06 --> 1614.02]  but it is what it is
[1614.02 --> 1615.34]  Paul says
[1615.34 --> 1618.18]  fathers do not exasperate
[1618.18 --> 1619.38]  or other translations
[1619.38 --> 1620.60]  will say enrage
[1620.60 --> 1621.76]  frustrate
[1621.76 --> 1622.64]  embitter
[1622.64 --> 1623.56]  your children
[1623.56 --> 1625.22]  instead bring them up
[1625.22 --> 1625.76]  in the training
[1625.76 --> 1626.52]  and the instruction
[1626.52 --> 1627.46]  of the Lord
[1627.46 --> 1629.34]  now that is just
[1629.34 --> 1630.24]  an important word
[1630.24 --> 1632.14]  there are ways
[1632.14 --> 1632.94]  that we can relate
[1632.94 --> 1633.68]  to our children
[1633.68 --> 1635.62]  that are outright destructive
[1635.62 --> 1637.56]  there are many
[1637.56 --> 1639.22]  and I don't want to generalize
[1639.22 --> 1639.74]  but some of us
[1639.74 --> 1640.56]  grew up in homes
[1640.56 --> 1641.44]  where the dad
[1641.44 --> 1642.16]  was more like
[1642.16 --> 1644.18]  a military authoritarian dictator
[1644.18 --> 1645.18]  than a dad
[1645.18 --> 1646.60]  and sometimes
[1646.60 --> 1647.34]  they thought
[1647.34 --> 1648.14]  what was necessary
[1648.14 --> 1648.98]  is just to bark
[1648.98 --> 1649.84]  orders at children
[1649.84 --> 1650.54]  and yell at them
[1650.54 --> 1651.66]  to get them to fall in line
[1651.66 --> 1652.12]  and sometimes
[1652.12 --> 1652.92]  it feels effective
[1652.92 --> 1653.92]  but that is not
[1653.92 --> 1654.70]  the way of parenting
[1654.70 --> 1655.30]  in Christ
[1655.30 --> 1656.60]  in fact
[1656.60 --> 1657.52]  in Colossians 3
[1657.52 --> 1658.10]  which is sort of
[1658.10 --> 1658.78]  a co-text
[1658.78 --> 1659.56]  to Ephesians 6
[1659.56 --> 1659.84]  it says
[1659.84 --> 1661.04]  fathers do not
[1661.04 --> 1662.02]  embitter your children
[1662.02 --> 1663.78]  because they will get discouraged
[1663.78 --> 1666.14]  they will become a shell
[1666.14 --> 1667.16]  of who they could be
[1667.16 --> 1668.48]  if you instruct them
[1668.48 --> 1669.30]  in the way of Christ
[1669.30 --> 1670.86]  and what our kids need
[1670.86 --> 1671.52]  hear this well
[1671.52 --> 1672.90]  what our kids all need
[1672.90 --> 1674.58]  is the love of Jesus
[1674.58 --> 1676.64]  the encouragement
[1676.64 --> 1677.42]  of Jesus
[1677.42 --> 1679.30]  and the patience
[1679.30 --> 1680.26]  of Jesus
[1680.26 --> 1681.48]  showing up in our parenting
[1681.48 --> 1683.14]  I'm not saying
[1683.14 --> 1683.64]  it's easy
[1683.64 --> 1684.50]  I'm saying
[1684.50 --> 1685.18]  that's what we're called
[1685.18 --> 1685.58]  to do
[1685.58 --> 1688.24]  and now positively
[1688.24 --> 1690.44]  Paul says
[1690.44 --> 1691.36]  this is what you are
[1691.36 --> 1691.90]  to do
[1691.90 --> 1693.76]  bring your kids up
[1693.76 --> 1694.70]  in the training
[1694.70 --> 1695.86]  and the instruction
[1695.86 --> 1696.88]  of the Lord
[1696.88 --> 1697.42]  and I'm going to spend
[1697.42 --> 1698.10]  a fair bit of time
[1698.10 --> 1699.36]  on just this one instruction
[1699.36 --> 1701.28]  there's a commentary
[1701.28 --> 1702.38]  commentator
[1702.38 --> 1702.96]  by the name of
[1702.96 --> 1703.94]  Francis Folks
[1703.94 --> 1705.50]  and when I read
[1705.50 --> 1706.34]  this quote this week
[1706.34 --> 1706.84]  it just kind of
[1706.84 --> 1707.64]  hit me between the eyes
[1707.64 --> 1708.10]  and I feel like
[1708.10 --> 1709.02]  you'll be just as challenged
[1709.02 --> 1710.02]  as I was by it
[1710.02 --> 1710.54]  he writes
[1710.54 --> 1712.28]  the task of parents
[1712.28 --> 1713.78]  to raise up a child
[1713.78 --> 1714.30]  in the training
[1714.30 --> 1714.80]  and instruction
[1714.80 --> 1715.28]  of the Lord
[1715.28 --> 1716.08]  means
[1716.08 --> 1717.70]  being more concerned
[1717.70 --> 1719.04]  about the relationship
[1719.04 --> 1720.02]  to the living God
[1720.02 --> 1721.00]  in Jesus Christ
[1721.00 --> 1722.64]  than anything else
[1722.64 --> 1724.32]  more concerned
[1724.32 --> 1725.28]  for that relationship
[1725.28 --> 1725.88]  than for their
[1725.88 --> 1726.92]  intellectual growth
[1726.92 --> 1728.26]  their health
[1728.26 --> 1729.96]  their material property
[1729.96 --> 1731.34]  their social status
[1731.34 --> 1732.40]  more concerned
[1732.40 --> 1733.18]  for them to know
[1733.18 --> 1734.36]  love and obey Jesus
[1734.36 --> 1736.76]  than anything else
[1736.76 --> 1738.18]  do you feel challenged
[1738.18 --> 1739.00]  by that like I do
[1739.00 --> 1741.12]  I know as parents
[1741.12 --> 1741.74]  in this room
[1741.74 --> 1742.66]  there's so much love
[1742.66 --> 1743.12]  for our kids
[1743.12 --> 1744.30]  and we do so much
[1744.30 --> 1745.22]  for our kids
[1745.22 --> 1746.02]  we run all over
[1746.02 --> 1747.12]  we give them good education
[1747.12 --> 1748.26]  we pour ourselves
[1748.26 --> 1749.22]  into them
[1749.22 --> 1749.76]  but I want to ask
[1749.76 --> 1750.24]  the question
[1750.24 --> 1752.32]  does this resonate
[1752.32 --> 1752.90]  with us
[1752.90 --> 1754.42]  is the main thing
[1754.42 --> 1755.26]  in our homes
[1755.26 --> 1756.46]  the main thing
[1756.46 --> 1757.90]  could it be said
[1757.90 --> 1758.68]  if someone were to
[1758.68 --> 1759.58]  survey your household
[1759.58 --> 1760.14]  for a week
[1760.14 --> 1761.02]  as you parent
[1761.02 --> 1761.44]  your children
[1761.44 --> 1762.10]  would it be said
[1762.10 --> 1762.56]  man
[1762.56 --> 1763.94]  this couple
[1763.94 --> 1764.86]  this parent
[1764.86 --> 1765.44]  is raising
[1765.44 --> 1765.98]  their children
[1765.98 --> 1767.14]  in the instruction
[1767.14 --> 1768.26]  and the teaching
[1768.26 --> 1769.20]  of the Lord
[1769.20 --> 1772.38]  and that obviously
[1772.38 --> 1773.14]  includes
[1773.14 --> 1774.22]  and I'll say this explicitly
[1774.22 --> 1774.78]  that includes
[1774.78 --> 1775.34]  making sure
[1775.34 --> 1775.84]  we are teaching
[1775.84 --> 1776.70]  our kids the scripture
[1776.70 --> 1778.96]  that there is some place
[1778.96 --> 1779.90]  in our daily routine
[1779.90 --> 1781.00]  where it's being read
[1781.00 --> 1782.20]  it's being talked about
[1782.20 --> 1783.50]  it includes praying
[1783.50 --> 1784.06]  with our kids
[1784.06 --> 1785.04]  whether when they rise
[1785.04 --> 1785.98]  or when they go to bed
[1785.98 --> 1787.02]  or over at the dinner table
[1787.02 --> 1787.94]  that we're praying
[1787.94 --> 1788.34]  with them
[1788.34 --> 1788.92]  and they know
[1788.92 --> 1789.46]  how to speak
[1789.46 --> 1790.32]  with their heavenly father
[1790.32 --> 1792.44]  but it also includes
[1792.44 --> 1793.82]  a lot
[1793.82 --> 1795.24]  of conversation
[1795.24 --> 1797.26]  I think one of the ways
[1797.26 --> 1798.18]  that we teach our children
[1798.18 --> 1798.98]  the way of Christ
[1798.98 --> 1800.00]  is by listening
[1800.00 --> 1800.66]  to the burdens
[1800.66 --> 1801.38]  of their hearts
[1801.38 --> 1803.20]  the bullying at school
[1803.20 --> 1804.84]  the failed grades
[1804.84 --> 1806.62]  the failure on the soccer field
[1806.62 --> 1807.48]  or the ballet class
[1807.48 --> 1808.76]  all the interpersonal conflict
[1808.76 --> 1809.46]  that comes with life
[1809.46 --> 1811.32]  and talking through with them
[1811.32 --> 1812.68]  how it is
[1812.68 --> 1813.58]  that they follow Jesus
[1813.58 --> 1814.54]  in those hard spaces
[1814.54 --> 1816.52]  I think that's raising our kids
[1816.52 --> 1817.00]  in the training
[1817.00 --> 1817.84]  and instruction of the Lord
[1817.84 --> 1818.96]  it's listening well
[1818.96 --> 1820.06]  knowing where their lives
[1820.06 --> 1820.48]  are going
[1820.48 --> 1821.04]  where they're at
[1821.04 --> 1822.80]  and then bringing Jesus
[1822.80 --> 1823.72]  to bear
[1823.72 --> 1825.12]  on their ordinary
[1825.12 --> 1826.06]  daily life
[1826.06 --> 1827.68]  it's helping them see
[1827.68 --> 1828.90]  how Jesus equips them
[1828.90 --> 1829.98]  how Jesus is with them
[1829.98 --> 1831.78]  how Jesus enables them
[1831.78 --> 1832.84]  to be faithful
[1832.84 --> 1834.18]  in every sphere
[1834.18 --> 1834.74]  of the life
[1834.74 --> 1835.46]  that they are in
[1835.46 --> 1838.24]  now this week
[1838.24 --> 1839.70]  I approached a number
[1839.70 --> 1840.72]  of parents in our church
[1840.72 --> 1842.26]  to ask them this question
[1842.26 --> 1842.78]  I just want to say
[1842.78 --> 1843.72]  thank you to the parents
[1843.72 --> 1844.50]  who got back to me
[1844.50 --> 1845.26]  I'm not going to quote you
[1845.26 --> 1845.70]  by name
[1845.70 --> 1847.82]  but I asked every parent
[1847.82 --> 1848.30]  the question
[1848.30 --> 1849.92]  what is the most challenging
[1849.92 --> 1850.38]  part
[1850.38 --> 1852.52]  of raising your kids
[1852.52 --> 1853.86]  to follow Jesus
[1853.86 --> 1855.06]  in this current moment
[1855.06 --> 1855.78]  that we live in
[1855.78 --> 1856.96]  and here are some
[1856.96 --> 1858.10]  of the main answers
[1858.10 --> 1858.96]  that they got back
[1858.96 --> 1859.54]  to me with
[1859.54 --> 1860.72]  number one
[1860.72 --> 1861.92]  guess what it is
[1861.92 --> 1865.28]  I knew you were going to say it
[1865.28 --> 1865.84]  screens
[1865.84 --> 1866.86]  yes
[1866.86 --> 1867.64]  after the end
[1867.64 --> 1868.90]  of a long day of work
[1868.90 --> 1870.04]  and after your kids
[1870.04 --> 1871.14]  came home hangry
[1871.14 --> 1871.76]  from school
[1871.76 --> 1873.14]  it is so tempting
[1873.14 --> 1874.20]  just to hand them
[1874.20 --> 1875.06]  that tablet
[1875.06 --> 1876.52]  give them that remote
[1876.52 --> 1877.70]  give them the controller
[1877.70 --> 1878.82]  and allow them
[1878.82 --> 1879.38]  just to veg
[1879.38 --> 1880.62]  and for you to veg
[1880.62 --> 1881.68]  and just so you know
[1881.68 --> 1882.54]  the challenge of screens
[1882.54 --> 1883.68]  is not just our kids problem
[1883.68 --> 1884.98]  it's our problem
[1884.98 --> 1886.48]  we're just as guilty
[1886.48 --> 1887.56]  of laying on the couch
[1887.56 --> 1888.86]  into the scroll of doom
[1888.86 --> 1889.78]  on Instagram
[1889.78 --> 1890.48]  or TikTok
[1890.48 --> 1892.12]  and our own habits
[1892.12 --> 1893.28]  are forming our kids
[1893.28 --> 1893.62]  it's like oh
[1893.62 --> 1895.16]  I guess this is what parenting is
[1895.16 --> 1896.20]  from these hours
[1896.20 --> 1896.72]  at night
[1896.72 --> 1898.14]  and don't hear me wrong
[1898.14 --> 1899.28]  there's nothing inherently
[1899.28 --> 1900.26]  evil about screens
[1900.26 --> 1901.56]  but one of the great challenges
[1901.56 --> 1902.52]  for Christian parents
[1902.52 --> 1904.36]  is limiting screens
[1904.36 --> 1906.28]  such that we've created space
[1906.28 --> 1907.00]  for conversation
[1907.00 --> 1907.56]  devotion
[1907.56 --> 1908.72]  and discipleship
[1908.72 --> 1911.34]  challenge number two
[1911.34 --> 1912.12]  guess what it is
[1912.12 --> 1916.26]  we are too busy
[1916.26 --> 1918.00]  and some of you
[1918.00 --> 1918.84]  might be feeling this already
[1918.84 --> 1919.40]  as I talk
[1919.40 --> 1920.62]  we don't even have time
[1920.62 --> 1921.44]  for a family meal
[1921.44 --> 1922.20]  you know
[1922.20 --> 1922.76]  you're racing
[1922.76 --> 1924.10]  to get someone home
[1924.10 --> 1925.00]  from a school practice
[1925.00 --> 1926.38]  and then you gotta scramble
[1926.38 --> 1927.32]  the meal together
[1927.32 --> 1928.06]  and then someone's out
[1928.06 --> 1928.54]  for ballet
[1928.54 --> 1929.58]  or they're out for soccer
[1929.58 --> 1930.72]  or they're out for violin lessons
[1930.72 --> 1931.40]  or whatever it is
[1931.40 --> 1932.34]  you feel like your home
[1932.34 --> 1933.28]  is just in and out
[1933.28 --> 1934.44]  and you're racing through it
[1934.44 --> 1935.26]  and I'll just say
[1935.26 --> 1937.20]  it's very hard to disciple
[1937.20 --> 1938.58]  in a home
[1938.58 --> 1940.16]  where the pace is frantic
[1940.16 --> 1941.60]  it's very hard
[1941.60 --> 1942.12]  to teach someone
[1942.12 --> 1942.66]  how to pray
[1942.66 --> 1943.42]  when you don't even
[1943.42 --> 1944.10]  have time together
[1944.10 --> 1945.70]  to really quiet your hearts
[1945.70 --> 1946.70]  and your minds
[1946.70 --> 1947.76]  in the presence of God
[1947.76 --> 1951.22]  challenge number three
[1951.22 --> 1953.50]  we have no idea
[1953.50 --> 1954.12]  what we're doing
[1954.12 --> 1955.82]  that comment came
[1955.82 --> 1956.72]  quite a few times
[1956.72 --> 1959.68]  yeah I see the resonance here
[1959.68 --> 1961.16]  we have no idea
[1961.16 --> 1961.74]  what we're doing
[1961.74 --> 1962.78]  and I just want to say
[1962.78 --> 1963.78]  thank you to those of you
[1963.78 --> 1964.50]  who got back to me
[1964.50 --> 1964.94]  and said look
[1964.94 --> 1965.98]  I didn't grow up a Christian
[1965.98 --> 1967.86]  I didn't have Christian parents
[1967.86 --> 1968.32]  and siblings
[1968.32 --> 1969.22]  and now I've got these
[1969.22 --> 1970.36]  little humans in my house
[1970.36 --> 1971.20]  and I don't know
[1971.20 --> 1971.90]  what I'm doing
[1971.90 --> 1973.98]  and I'll just be really real
[1973.98 --> 1974.32]  with you
[1974.32 --> 1975.22]  for a lot of parents
[1975.22 --> 1975.76]  who didn't grow up
[1975.76 --> 1976.36]  with Christianity
[1976.36 --> 1977.92]  the idea of reading
[1977.92 --> 1979.06]  a Bible story with the kids
[1979.06 --> 1979.82]  is a bit scary
[1979.82 --> 1980.32]  because you're like
[1980.32 --> 1981.14]  well what if my son
[1981.14 --> 1981.48]  or daughter
[1981.48 --> 1982.18]  asked me a question
[1982.18 --> 1982.52]  about Noah
[1982.52 --> 1983.30]  and I don't know
[1983.30 --> 1984.22]  who Noah is
[1984.22 --> 1985.22]  or I don't know
[1985.22 --> 1985.88]  why this story
[1985.88 --> 1986.48]  is in the Bible
[1986.48 --> 1987.54]  and I want to take a moment
[1987.54 --> 1988.28]  just to encourage you
[1988.28 --> 1988.76]  specifically
[1988.76 --> 1990.50]  I just think
[1990.50 --> 1991.44]  that one of the most
[1991.44 --> 1992.20]  profound ways
[1992.20 --> 1992.84]  we can parent
[1992.84 --> 1994.12]  is by saying to our kids
[1994.12 --> 1995.50]  I don't know the answer
[1995.50 --> 1996.08]  to this
[1996.08 --> 1997.34]  but I want to learn
[1997.34 --> 1997.88]  it with you
[1997.88 --> 1999.72]  I don't know exactly
[1999.72 --> 2000.46]  how to live this out
[2000.46 --> 2001.60]  but why don't we discover
[2001.60 --> 2002.44]  that together
[2002.44 --> 2003.92]  your kids aren't looking
[2003.92 --> 2004.70]  for an expert
[2004.70 --> 2006.12]  if it's any encouragement
[2006.12 --> 2007.06]  my kids ask me questions
[2007.06 --> 2007.74]  all the time
[2007.74 --> 2008.24]  that I don't know
[2008.24 --> 2008.86]  the answer to
[2008.86 --> 2010.76]  but what they do need
[2010.76 --> 2011.30]  to hear is
[2011.30 --> 2012.20]  here's a mom
[2012.20 --> 2012.72]  or a dad
[2012.72 --> 2013.42]  who's willing to say
[2013.42 --> 2014.70]  let's figure it out together
[2014.70 --> 2016.18]  let's try practicing
[2016.18 --> 2016.74]  this together
[2016.74 --> 2018.10]  let's as a family
[2018.10 --> 2019.24]  lean into the scriptures
[2019.24 --> 2020.32]  and allow them to shape us
[2020.32 --> 2021.44]  and we're just going to learn
[2021.44 --> 2022.34]  as we go
[2022.34 --> 2023.80]  trusting that the spirit
[2023.80 --> 2024.32]  is at work
[2024.32 --> 2025.20]  as we open the Bible
[2025.20 --> 2026.76]  trusting that God loves us
[2026.76 --> 2027.34]  in this home
[2027.34 --> 2028.68]  he knows our brokenness
[2028.68 --> 2029.56]  and he walks with us
[2029.56 --> 2030.96]  every step of the way
[2030.96 --> 2032.38]  those of us
[2032.38 --> 2033.06]  who did not grow up
[2033.06 --> 2033.62]  in the church
[2033.62 --> 2034.70]  I think you have
[2034.70 --> 2035.52]  everything you need
[2035.52 --> 2037.00]  to learn with your kids
[2037.00 --> 2037.52]  and that will be
[2037.52 --> 2038.98]  deep beautiful formation
[2038.98 --> 2041.86]  some other challenges
[2041.86 --> 2042.28]  mentioned
[2042.28 --> 2043.46]  competitive parenting
[2043.46 --> 2044.50]  it's a thing
[2044.50 --> 2045.98]  the pressure
[2045.98 --> 2047.44]  to be a friend
[2047.44 --> 2048.92]  rather than a parent
[2048.92 --> 2049.82]  you've seen this
[2049.82 --> 2050.80]  we all have that temptation
[2050.80 --> 2051.98]  oh I don't want to
[2051.98 --> 2052.84]  bring discipline here
[2052.84 --> 2053.34]  I don't want to put
[2053.34 --> 2053.92]  boundaries in here
[2053.92 --> 2054.46]  because I want them
[2054.46 --> 2055.08]  to love me
[2055.08 --> 2055.80]  trust me
[2055.80 --> 2056.80]  that backfires
[2056.80 --> 2057.80]  really badly
[2057.80 --> 2059.28]  as your kids get older
[2059.28 --> 2061.80]  a million different
[2061.80 --> 2062.78]  competing pieces
[2062.78 --> 2063.58]  of advice
[2063.58 --> 2064.58]  on social media
[2064.58 --> 2065.38]  about how to do
[2065.38 --> 2066.32]  the best as a parent
[2066.32 --> 2067.26]  that always conflict
[2067.26 --> 2068.06]  with the last thing
[2068.06 --> 2068.44]  you heard
[2068.44 --> 2069.38]  on social media
[2069.38 --> 2069.96]  about how to
[2069.96 --> 2071.24]  raise your kids well
[2071.24 --> 2073.10]  there are so many challenges
[2073.10 --> 2076.10]  let me name a final challenge
[2076.10 --> 2076.90]  that I think is going to
[2076.90 --> 2078.04]  hit home for all of us
[2078.04 --> 2079.98]  the challenge is that
[2079.98 --> 2081.32]  our homes are so much
[2081.32 --> 2081.86]  more broken
[2081.86 --> 2083.58]  and messy
[2083.58 --> 2085.38]  and dysfunctional
[2085.38 --> 2086.34]  than we are ready
[2086.34 --> 2086.92]  to admit
[2086.92 --> 2089.24]  and I know for a number
[2089.24 --> 2089.58]  of us
[2089.58 --> 2090.66]  even hearing this passage
[2090.66 --> 2091.48]  on Ephesians 6
[2091.48 --> 2092.48]  brings up pain
[2092.48 --> 2094.00]  perhaps bitterness
[2094.00 --> 2095.64]  perhaps guilt
[2095.64 --> 2097.52]  pain because you grew up
[2097.52 --> 2098.14]  in a family where
[2098.14 --> 2099.10]  it was just chaos
[2099.10 --> 2101.30]  guilt because you wish
[2101.30 --> 2102.50]  you could go back
[2102.50 --> 2103.42]  to when your kids
[2103.42 --> 2103.82]  were young
[2103.82 --> 2104.74]  and do it differently
[2104.74 --> 2105.62]  yell less
[2105.62 --> 2106.52]  be present more
[2106.52 --> 2107.36]  work less
[2107.36 --> 2107.84]  so that you are
[2107.84 --> 2108.88]  available to your kids
[2108.88 --> 2109.50]  I know it
[2109.50 --> 2110.52]  guilt is real
[2110.52 --> 2111.26]  as we get older
[2111.26 --> 2112.58]  and of course
[2112.58 --> 2113.66]  just a lot of heartache
[2113.66 --> 2114.94]  because our homes
[2114.94 --> 2115.46]  for many of us
[2115.46 --> 2116.46]  were not safe places
[2116.46 --> 2117.40]  they were places
[2117.40 --> 2118.10]  of conflict
[2118.10 --> 2118.90]  bitterness
[2118.90 --> 2120.14]  grudge keeping
[2120.14 --> 2120.92]  estrangement
[2120.92 --> 2121.64]  and even hatred
[2121.64 --> 2124.42]  some of us
[2124.42 --> 2124.96]  in this room
[2124.96 --> 2126.28]  might have amazing parents
[2126.28 --> 2128.10]  and you just grew up
[2128.10 --> 2128.92]  with their encouragement
[2128.92 --> 2129.74]  and their love
[2129.74 --> 2132.50]  but some of us didn't
[2132.50 --> 2133.58]  we grew up with parents
[2133.58 --> 2134.40]  who did not give us
[2134.40 --> 2135.16]  wise advice
[2135.16 --> 2136.34]  parents who were not
[2136.34 --> 2137.60]  always for us
[2137.60 --> 2138.74]  parents who didn't
[2138.74 --> 2140.08]  always love us
[2140.08 --> 2142.62]  some of us have children
[2142.62 --> 2143.62]  who are struggling
[2143.62 --> 2144.70]  in ways that totally
[2144.70 --> 2145.50]  overwhelm us
[2145.50 --> 2145.90]  whether it be
[2145.90 --> 2146.70]  mental illness
[2146.70 --> 2147.72]  addiction
[2147.72 --> 2149.16]  relational complexity
[2149.16 --> 2149.80]  and more
[2149.80 --> 2151.82]  some of us have parents
[2151.82 --> 2152.58]  who aren't speaking
[2152.58 --> 2153.28]  to each other
[2153.28 --> 2155.26]  some of us have kids
[2155.26 --> 2156.42]  who have left the church
[2156.42 --> 2157.56]  run away from the church
[2157.56 --> 2158.30]  they've been burned
[2158.30 --> 2159.14]  by the church
[2159.14 --> 2161.00]  some of us are parenting
[2161.00 --> 2161.84]  on our own
[2161.84 --> 2163.76]  and I don't want you
[2163.76 --> 2164.44]  to think that I have
[2164.44 --> 2165.06]  all the answers
[2165.06 --> 2166.98]  for how we are to parent
[2166.98 --> 2167.86]  and be kids
[2167.86 --> 2169.26]  in very complex
[2169.26 --> 2171.00]  challenging circumstances
[2171.00 --> 2172.68]  I really do think
[2172.68 --> 2173.76]  it takes a lot of wisdom
[2173.76 --> 2175.78]  it takes a lot of prayer
[2175.78 --> 2177.52]  and it takes a lot of
[2177.52 --> 2178.52]  sitting with the Bible
[2178.52 --> 2179.68]  and being with your
[2179.68 --> 2180.62]  brothers and sisters
[2180.62 --> 2181.64]  in the church
[2181.64 --> 2183.22]  to know how to parent well
[2183.22 --> 2184.14]  in all these situations
[2184.14 --> 2186.16]  I don't have all the wisdom
[2186.16 --> 2187.36]  you don't have all the wisdom
[2187.36 --> 2188.30]  but I think collectively
[2188.30 --> 2189.20]  as we discern
[2189.20 --> 2189.90]  God's will together
[2189.90 --> 2191.34]  we gain the ability
[2191.34 --> 2192.36]  to disciple as well
[2192.36 --> 2192.96]  as we can
[2192.96 --> 2194.72]  given the circumstances
[2194.72 --> 2195.28]  we're in
[2195.28 --> 2196.84]  maybe two pieces
[2196.84 --> 2198.30]  of extremely practical advice
[2198.30 --> 2199.72]  for all of us as parents
[2199.72 --> 2200.38]  is number one
[2200.38 --> 2202.68]  find people to do it with
[2202.68 --> 2204.64]  do not parent on your own
[2204.64 --> 2206.14]  you don't have what it takes
[2206.14 --> 2206.80]  your kids are going to
[2206.80 --> 2207.80]  press all sorts of buttons
[2207.80 --> 2209.04]  talk to a friend
[2209.04 --> 2210.80]  talk to an older parent
[2210.80 --> 2211.82]  talk to a relative
[2211.82 --> 2213.14]  who's been down that journey
[2213.14 --> 2215.14]  and allow them to give advice
[2215.14 --> 2216.32]  to pray for you
[2216.32 --> 2217.12]  to journey with you
[2217.12 --> 2218.22]  to take your kids
[2218.22 --> 2218.86]  when you're at the end
[2218.86 --> 2219.40]  of your rope
[2219.40 --> 2220.84]  don't do it by yourself
[2220.84 --> 2222.98]  it takes a community
[2222.98 --> 2223.82]  to raise a kid
[2223.82 --> 2225.10]  and it takes a community
[2225.10 --> 2225.96]  to parent well
[2225.96 --> 2227.64]  but secondly
[2227.64 --> 2228.90]  and I'll say what we've been
[2228.90 --> 2230.06]  repeating throughout this series
[2230.06 --> 2233.66]  God lives in your home
[2233.66 --> 2235.72]  He knows the burdens
[2235.72 --> 2236.34]  of your heart
[2236.34 --> 2237.56]  He knows when you're
[2237.56 --> 2238.38]  at the end of your rope
[2238.38 --> 2240.24]  bring your burdens to Him
[2240.24 --> 2241.26]  He cares for you
[2241.26 --> 2243.02]  and He wants nothing more
[2243.02 --> 2244.14]  than to equip you
[2244.14 --> 2245.64]  with everything you need
[2245.64 --> 2246.34]  to disciple
[2246.34 --> 2247.62]  and raise your kids
[2247.62 --> 2248.76]  to know Jesus
[2248.76 --> 2250.34]  that is deep to the heart
[2250.34 --> 2251.02]  of God
[2251.02 --> 2252.60]  to give you what you need
[2252.60 --> 2253.40]  in every season
[2253.40 --> 2254.38]  no matter what
[2254.38 --> 2255.60]  the challenge
[2255.60 --> 2259.98]  now when I wrote the sermon
[2259.98 --> 2261.22]  I had so many rabbit trails
[2261.22 --> 2262.62]  that I was going to go down
[2262.62 --> 2263.58]  and I want to hunker down
[2263.58 --> 2264.14]  on what I think
[2264.14 --> 2265.64]  might be the most important thing
[2265.64 --> 2266.38]  for us to hear today
[2266.38 --> 2268.76]  I'm convinced
[2268.76 --> 2271.06]  that if we are to raise our kids
[2271.06 --> 2271.62]  in the training
[2271.62 --> 2272.52]  and instruction of the Lord
[2272.52 --> 2273.50]  and if we are to obey
[2273.50 --> 2274.88]  and honor our parents
[2274.88 --> 2276.92]  we will need to learn
[2276.92 --> 2278.64]  how to live
[2278.64 --> 2279.98]  with our family members
[2279.98 --> 2282.14]  embodying the grace
[2282.14 --> 2283.08]  of Jesus
[2283.08 --> 2285.04]  in fact
[2285.04 --> 2286.18]  the more I think about it
[2286.18 --> 2286.96]  I'll share with you
[2286.96 --> 2287.50]  a conviction
[2287.50 --> 2288.46]  that has been sitting
[2288.46 --> 2289.16]  with me all week
[2289.16 --> 2291.16]  the distinguishing part
[2291.16 --> 2292.12]  of a Christian home
[2292.12 --> 2293.70]  is not the absence
[2293.70 --> 2294.38]  of conflict
[2294.38 --> 2296.70]  the distinguishing part
[2296.70 --> 2297.28]  of a Christian home
[2297.28 --> 2298.22]  is not that your kids
[2298.22 --> 2299.00]  are all buttoned up
[2299.00 --> 2299.84]  everything looks great
[2299.84 --> 2300.74]  no one's yelling
[2300.74 --> 2301.44]  no one's throwing
[2301.44 --> 2302.96]  their food across the table
[2302.96 --> 2303.86]  no one's walking
[2303.86 --> 2304.30]  out of the house
[2304.30 --> 2305.32]  or slamming the door
[2305.32 --> 2307.36]  as loudly as they possibly could
[2307.36 --> 2308.76]  those are not the things
[2308.76 --> 2309.90]  that make us distinct
[2309.90 --> 2310.96]  what makes us distinct
[2310.96 --> 2312.16]  is that in the middle
[2312.16 --> 2312.92]  of our conflict
[2312.92 --> 2314.68]  we learn
[2314.68 --> 2316.04]  how to extend
[2316.04 --> 2317.86]  the grace of Jesus Christ
[2317.86 --> 2319.80]  we learn
[2319.80 --> 2320.78]  how to ask
[2320.78 --> 2321.54]  for forgiveness
[2321.54 --> 2323.18]  when we have thoroughly
[2323.18 --> 2324.88]  messed things up
[2324.88 --> 2326.58]  and like we've said
[2326.58 --> 2327.36]  already in this series
[2327.36 --> 2329.24]  sometimes the hardest people
[2329.24 --> 2329.82]  to forgive
[2329.82 --> 2331.84]  and to ask forgiveness from
[2331.84 --> 2333.22]  are the people you live
[2333.22 --> 2334.00]  in the same house with
[2334.00 --> 2337.58]  last week when Pastor Sid
[2337.58 --> 2338.36]  was talking about marriage
[2338.36 --> 2339.42]  he said the hardest thing
[2339.42 --> 2339.92]  in the world
[2339.92 --> 2341.74]  is to have the humility
[2341.74 --> 2342.90]  to put down the sword
[2342.90 --> 2344.66]  and stop attacking
[2344.66 --> 2346.86]  and say to your loved one
[2346.86 --> 2349.26]  I am sorry
[2349.26 --> 2351.66]  will you forgive me
[2351.66 --> 2353.56]  and all of a sudden
[2353.56 --> 2354.26]  when you do that
[2354.26 --> 2354.98]  you're inviting
[2354.98 --> 2356.60]  the power of Jesus
[2356.60 --> 2358.02]  into your home
[2358.02 --> 2358.60]  you're inviting
[2358.60 --> 2359.52]  your spouse
[2359.52 --> 2360.14]  or your parent
[2360.14 --> 2360.64]  or your child
[2360.64 --> 2361.54]  into a space
[2361.54 --> 2362.76]  where they can extend
[2362.76 --> 2363.88]  grace
[2363.88 --> 2365.28]  because that
[2365.28 --> 2366.14]  is what makes homes
[2366.14 --> 2367.84]  distinctively Christian
[2367.84 --> 2370.36]  an author I quite like
[2370.36 --> 2371.34]  said about this passage
[2371.34 --> 2372.24]  that we are never
[2372.24 --> 2373.70]  more like Jesus
[2373.70 --> 2375.40]  than when we forgive
[2375.40 --> 2377.48]  we are never
[2377.48 --> 2378.82]  embodying the person
[2378.82 --> 2379.48]  and the character
[2379.48 --> 2380.26]  of Jesus more
[2380.26 --> 2381.16]  than when we say
[2381.16 --> 2381.60]  to someone
[2381.60 --> 2383.44]  you are forgiven
[2383.44 --> 2385.52]  and we get the opportunity
[2385.52 --> 2386.14]  in the midst
[2386.14 --> 2387.02]  of the messiness
[2387.02 --> 2387.80]  of our homes
[2387.80 --> 2389.36]  to practice that
[2389.36 --> 2393.38]  most parents
[2393.38 --> 2395.68]  know their failings
[2395.68 --> 2398.06]  most parents
[2398.06 --> 2399.34]  don't feel very good
[2399.34 --> 2400.24]  about how they're parenting
[2400.24 --> 2401.22]  after 9am service
[2401.22 --> 2401.70]  I was listening
[2401.70 --> 2402.54]  to some of the conversation
[2402.54 --> 2403.56]  we were just kind of debriefing
[2403.56 --> 2404.08]  like man
[2404.08 --> 2405.30]  we've got a ways to go
[2405.30 --> 2406.44]  most children
[2406.44 --> 2407.18]  know
[2407.18 --> 2407.82]  that they are not
[2407.82 --> 2409.12]  the most obedient kids
[2409.12 --> 2410.14]  who honor their parents
[2410.14 --> 2411.78]  and what is needed
[2411.78 --> 2413.34]  is grace
[2413.34 --> 2415.12]  in fact
[2415.12 --> 2415.98]  I would love for you
[2415.98 --> 2416.62]  to talk about this
[2416.62 --> 2417.26]  when you get home
[2417.26 --> 2418.58]  but when you think
[2418.58 --> 2419.06]  of some of the most
[2419.06 --> 2420.00]  defining moments
[2420.00 --> 2420.76]  as a child
[2420.76 --> 2421.28]  for you
[2421.28 --> 2422.32]  I'm curious
[2422.32 --> 2423.04]  what they are
[2423.04 --> 2424.40]  because our family
[2424.40 --> 2424.98]  as I've mentioned
[2424.98 --> 2425.78]  I grew up in a family
[2425.78 --> 2426.50]  with five boys
[2426.50 --> 2427.58]  we had no absence
[2427.58 --> 2428.26]  of conflict
[2428.26 --> 2429.18]  there were times
[2429.18 --> 2429.70]  where I just look
[2429.70 --> 2430.12]  at my parents
[2430.12 --> 2430.28]  and I'm like
[2430.28 --> 2430.86]  how did you even
[2430.86 --> 2431.72]  raise us
[2431.72 --> 2432.78]  we were so good
[2432.78 --> 2433.20]  at fighting
[2433.20 --> 2433.88]  over everything
[2433.88 --> 2434.72]  you could turn
[2434.72 --> 2434.98]  into something
[2434.98 --> 2435.46]  that shouldn't be
[2435.46 --> 2435.80]  fought over
[2435.80 --> 2436.34]  and we could fight
[2436.34 --> 2436.82]  over that
[2436.82 --> 2438.16]  and one of the most
[2438.16 --> 2439.12]  defining moments
[2439.12 --> 2440.82]  of my junior youth life
[2440.82 --> 2441.86]  I think I was a grade six
[2441.86 --> 2442.38]  or so
[2442.38 --> 2443.96]  one of those crazy nights
[2443.96 --> 2444.48]  in our household
[2444.48 --> 2445.32]  I remember my dad
[2445.32 --> 2446.20]  coming into my room
[2446.20 --> 2447.16]  as I was already in bed
[2447.16 --> 2448.18]  he sat on my bed
[2448.18 --> 2450.16]  and he asked for my forgiveness
[2450.16 --> 2451.84]  because of the conflict
[2451.84 --> 2452.60]  that we had had
[2452.60 --> 2454.32]  and he has no idea
[2454.32 --> 2455.24]  but in that moment
[2455.24 --> 2456.82]  he taught me so much
[2456.82 --> 2457.80]  about parenting
[2457.80 --> 2460.16]  he taught me so much
[2460.16 --> 2460.84]  about humility
[2460.84 --> 2462.12]  just by asking
[2462.12 --> 2463.10]  for forgiveness
[2463.10 --> 2464.82]  opening up the space
[2464.82 --> 2465.22]  of grace
[2465.22 --> 2465.94]  to flow from this
[2465.94 --> 2466.88]  little kid
[2466.88 --> 2468.18]  who probably deserved
[2468.18 --> 2469.54]  everything he said to me
[2469.54 --> 2470.74]  but he had the humility
[2470.74 --> 2471.62]  to put the sword down
[2471.62 --> 2471.96]  and say
[2471.96 --> 2472.40]  Dave
[2472.40 --> 2473.84]  will you forgive me
[2473.84 --> 2474.66]  for what I said
[2474.66 --> 2476.70]  what's that look like
[2476.70 --> 2477.18]  in your home
[2477.18 --> 2479.26]  what's the stuff
[2479.26 --> 2480.02]  coming to your mind
[2480.02 --> 2480.56]  as you think about
[2480.56 --> 2481.12]  your marriage
[2481.12 --> 2481.96]  and your relationship
[2481.96 --> 2482.60]  with your kids
[2482.60 --> 2483.30]  or your relationship
[2483.30 --> 2483.94]  with your parent
[2483.94 --> 2485.36]  where's the space
[2485.36 --> 2486.20]  where you know
[2486.20 --> 2487.10]  you've messed up
[2487.10 --> 2488.12]  and the invitation
[2488.12 --> 2489.32]  from Jesus Christ
[2489.32 --> 2490.82]  the ultimate example
[2490.82 --> 2491.28]  of forgiveness
[2491.28 --> 2492.18]  is for you to say
[2492.18 --> 2493.96]  will you forgive me
[2493.96 --> 2496.18]  and will you with me
[2496.18 --> 2497.34]  take that journey
[2497.34 --> 2498.48]  towards reconciliation
[2498.48 --> 2500.44]  so that we can enjoy
[2500.44 --> 2501.40]  the gift of forgiveness
[2501.40 --> 2502.30]  in this household
[2502.30 --> 2508.96]  now we started this series
[2508.96 --> 2509.66]  a couple weeks ago
[2509.66 --> 2510.34]  with the conviction
[2510.34 --> 2512.32]  that one of the places
[2512.32 --> 2513.54]  we really do believe
[2513.54 --> 2515.10]  where people will see
[2515.10 --> 2515.66]  the gospel
[2515.66 --> 2516.88]  is not necessarily
[2516.88 --> 2517.76]  on a Sunday morning
[2517.76 --> 2518.76]  although I do believe
[2518.76 --> 2519.32]  that's true
[2519.32 --> 2520.40]  but when people
[2520.40 --> 2521.62]  who do not yet know Jesus
[2521.62 --> 2522.38]  the place where they
[2522.38 --> 2523.80]  will likely first experience
[2523.80 --> 2524.34]  the gospel
[2524.34 --> 2525.14]  and see Christianity
[2525.14 --> 2525.58]  lived out
[2525.58 --> 2526.68]  is in your home
[2526.68 --> 2528.86]  it's your ordinary life
[2528.86 --> 2529.46]  on display
[2529.46 --> 2530.14]  with your neighbors
[2530.14 --> 2531.32]  who think very different things
[2531.32 --> 2532.50]  that will likely be
[2532.50 --> 2533.34]  their first taste
[2533.34 --> 2534.76]  of what it is like
[2534.76 --> 2535.60]  to see a disciple
[2535.60 --> 2536.68]  of Jesus in action
[2536.68 --> 2538.14]  and I thought
[2538.14 --> 2538.60]  it would be fitting
[2538.60 --> 2539.38]  for me to finish
[2539.38 --> 2539.84]  this sermon
[2539.84 --> 2540.52]  with a story
[2540.52 --> 2541.94]  that I hope encourages you
[2541.94 --> 2543.38]  that brings mission
[2543.38 --> 2544.84]  and discipleship
[2544.84 --> 2545.40]  and formation
[2545.40 --> 2546.48]  in our homes together
[2546.48 --> 2547.20]  and it's a story
[2547.20 --> 2548.02]  told by a man
[2548.02 --> 2549.28]  named Jim Peterson
[2549.28 --> 2551.60]  Jim went to university
[2551.60 --> 2552.46]  a secular university
[2552.46 --> 2553.34]  when he was younger
[2553.34 --> 2554.86]  and at university
[2554.86 --> 2555.68]  he met a young guy
[2555.68 --> 2556.32]  named Mario
[2556.32 --> 2557.84]  and Jim was a believer
[2557.84 --> 2559.08]  Mario was very much
[2559.08 --> 2559.46]  an atheist
[2559.46 --> 2560.80]  and for four years
[2560.80 --> 2561.66]  while they were in university
[2561.66 --> 2563.20]  they debated Christianity
[2563.20 --> 2564.54]  they debated atheism
[2564.54 --> 2565.58]  they were sharing books
[2565.58 --> 2566.50]  with each other
[2566.50 --> 2568.06]  constant conversation
[2568.06 --> 2568.60]  in love
[2568.60 --> 2569.22]  it was charitable
[2569.22 --> 2570.04]  they were understanding
[2570.04 --> 2570.80]  they were friends
[2570.80 --> 2572.54]  then they graduated
[2572.54 --> 2573.62]  and went their separate ways
[2573.62 --> 2574.90]  Jim got married
[2574.90 --> 2575.84]  he had kids young
[2575.84 --> 2576.98]  as Christians often do
[2576.98 --> 2578.24]  and Mario went off
[2578.24 --> 2579.28]  and pursued his career
[2579.28 --> 2580.08]  but Mario would still
[2580.08 --> 2580.84]  visit his home
[2580.84 --> 2581.28]  regularly
[2581.28 --> 2582.10]  catch up
[2582.10 --> 2583.24]  tell stories of university
[2583.24 --> 2584.52]  meet Jim's family
[2584.52 --> 2586.14]  and then many years
[2586.14 --> 2587.68]  after their university days
[2587.68 --> 2588.80]  Mario became a Christian
[2588.80 --> 2591.04]  and one of the first people
[2591.04 --> 2592.08]  he wanted to tell about it
[2592.08 --> 2592.70]  was Jim
[2592.70 --> 2593.66]  who was with him
[2593.66 --> 2594.68]  basically from the beginning
[2594.68 --> 2595.36]  of that journey
[2595.36 --> 2596.68]  and he said to Jim
[2596.68 --> 2597.22]  you know
[2597.22 --> 2599.04]  what brought me to Christianity
[2599.04 --> 2601.34]  perhaps more than anything else
[2601.34 --> 2604.96]  was being in your home
[2604.96 --> 2607.30]  seeing you live out
[2607.30 --> 2608.38]  the ordinary life
[2608.38 --> 2609.04]  of family
[2609.04 --> 2610.12]  as believers
[2610.12 --> 2610.52]  he says
[2610.52 --> 2612.28]  that pulled me in
[2612.28 --> 2613.90]  to the goodness of Jesus
[2613.90 --> 2615.54]  and of course
[2615.54 --> 2616.54]  Jim had no idea
[2616.54 --> 2617.50]  and Jim often
[2617.50 --> 2618.46]  he wrote about
[2618.46 --> 2618.96]  how he admits
[2618.96 --> 2620.12]  how embarrassing it was
[2620.12 --> 2621.02]  when his kids were young
[2621.02 --> 2622.10]  to have Mario over
[2622.10 --> 2623.40]  and the kids were not obeying
[2623.40 --> 2624.50]  and the table was not clean
[2624.50 --> 2625.10]  and the conversation
[2625.10 --> 2625.82]  was complicated
[2625.82 --> 2627.34]  and yet that was the place
[2627.34 --> 2628.28]  where Mario saw
[2628.28 --> 2629.36]  the gospel lived out
[2629.36 --> 2631.54]  I want to finish
[2631.54 --> 2632.06]  with a quote
[2632.06 --> 2633.28]  that Jim writes back
[2633.28 --> 2634.42]  looking on this experience
[2634.42 --> 2634.86]  with Mario
[2634.86 --> 2635.50]  and I think I have it
[2635.50 --> 2635.98]  on the screen
[2635.98 --> 2637.42]  he writes
[2637.42 --> 2639.48]  our family was unaware
[2639.48 --> 2641.02]  of its influence on Mario
[2641.02 --> 2642.98]  God had done this work
[2642.98 --> 2643.72]  through our family
[2643.72 --> 2645.82]  without our knowing it
[2645.82 --> 2647.76]  we tend to see
[2647.76 --> 2648.42]  the weaknesses
[2648.42 --> 2649.58]  and incongruities
[2649.58 --> 2650.44]  of our lives
[2650.44 --> 2651.48]  and our reaction
[2651.48 --> 2652.30]  is to recoil
[2652.30 --> 2653.28]  at the thought
[2653.28 --> 2654.50]  of letting outsiders
[2654.50 --> 2655.46]  get close enough
[2655.46 --> 2656.06]  to see us
[2656.06 --> 2657.62]  as we really are
[2657.62 --> 2659.62]  even if our assessment
[2659.62 --> 2660.24]  is accurate
[2660.24 --> 2661.36]  it is my observation
[2661.36 --> 2662.32]  that any Christian
[2662.32 --> 2663.12]  and I will add
[2663.12 --> 2663.86]  any family
[2663.86 --> 2665.18]  who is sincerely
[2665.18 --> 2666.24]  seeking to walk
[2666.24 --> 2666.72]  with God
[2666.72 --> 2668.02]  in spite of all
[2668.02 --> 2668.90]  their flaws
[2668.90 --> 2670.52]  is reflecting
[2670.52 --> 2671.34]  something
[2671.34 --> 2673.10]  of Christ
[2673.10 --> 2675.38]  Amen
[2675.38 --> 2676.98]  would you pray with me
[2676.98 --> 2684.04]  Father we want to begin
[2684.04 --> 2684.52]  this prayer
[2684.52 --> 2685.16]  with gratitude
[2685.16 --> 2687.64]  we praise you
[2687.64 --> 2688.48]  for our families
[2688.48 --> 2690.40]  we praise you
[2690.40 --> 2691.10]  for our parents
[2691.10 --> 2691.88]  and for our children
[2691.88 --> 2693.84]  we praise you
[2693.84 --> 2694.76]  for the gift it is
[2694.76 --> 2695.98]  to be in a family
[2695.98 --> 2697.42]  and this morning
[2697.42 --> 2697.98]  we praise you
[2697.98 --> 2698.52]  for Sophia
[2698.52 --> 2701.12]  we ask Lord
[2701.12 --> 2701.96]  for your power
[2701.96 --> 2703.70]  to come into our homes
[2703.70 --> 2705.70]  as we think about
[2705.70 --> 2706.82]  the places of conflict
[2706.82 --> 2708.54]  the tense relationships
[2708.54 --> 2709.60]  the family dynamics
[2709.60 --> 2710.88]  we ask that the grace
[2710.88 --> 2711.72]  of Christ
[2711.72 --> 2713.04]  would come into
[2713.04 --> 2714.02]  those hard places
[2714.02 --> 2715.88]  and that even this week
[2715.88 --> 2716.56]  we would have
[2716.56 --> 2717.14]  the humility
[2717.14 --> 2718.50]  that comes from your spirit
[2718.50 --> 2720.32]  to ask for forgiveness
[2720.32 --> 2722.72]  I pray Lord
[2722.72 --> 2723.40]  that you would give us
[2723.40 --> 2723.84]  the ability
[2723.84 --> 2724.88]  to invite others
[2724.88 --> 2725.82]  into our homes
[2725.82 --> 2727.10]  trusting that even
[2727.10 --> 2728.28]  our broken way
[2728.28 --> 2729.08]  of following Jesus
[2729.08 --> 2729.56]  together
[2729.56 --> 2730.86]  will bear witness
[2730.86 --> 2731.74]  to the grace
[2731.74 --> 2733.24]  of Jesus Christ
[2733.24 --> 2735.60]  to you be all the glory
[2735.60 --> 2736.66]  Amen
[2736.66 --> 2741.58]  at this time
[2741.58 --> 2741.86]  we are going to have
[2741.86 --> 2742.86]  a song of response
[2742.86 --> 2743.76]  and I actually want you
[2743.76 --> 2744.88]  to stay seated for it
[2744.88 --> 2746.68]  this for probably
[2746.68 --> 2747.30]  most of us
[2747.30 --> 2747.72]  is going to be
[2747.72 --> 2748.70]  a song you've never heard
[2748.70 --> 2749.14]  some of us
[2749.14 --> 2749.76]  maybe it is a song
[2749.76 --> 2750.12]  you've heard
[2750.12 --> 2751.60]  but we picked it
[2751.60 --> 2752.24]  because we want
[2752.24 --> 2752.80]  the worship team
[2752.80 --> 2753.92]  to actually pray this
[2753.92 --> 2754.50]  over us
[2754.50 --> 2755.28]  to worship this
[2755.28 --> 2756.04]  over us
[2756.04 --> 2756.86]  this is a prayer
[2756.86 --> 2757.98]  of blessing
[2757.98 --> 2758.58]  it's a prayer
[2758.58 --> 2759.36]  of encouragement
[2759.36 --> 2761.46]  and so just receive it
[2761.46 --> 2761.88]  they're going to
[2761.88 --> 2762.42]  I believe they're
[2762.42 --> 2763.26]  singing it through twice
[2763.26 --> 2764.82]  and if you're feeling
[2764.82 --> 2765.60]  just really burdened
[2765.60 --> 2766.02]  by family
[2766.02 --> 2767.28]  allow this to minister
[2767.28 --> 2767.78]  to you
[2767.78 --> 2768.70]  you don't have to sing
[2768.70 --> 2770.28]  the third time around
[2770.28 --> 2771.12]  if you feel like
[2771.12 --> 2772.02]  you're ready to sing it
[2772.02 --> 2772.72]  you can join us
[2772.72 --> 2773.22]  in singing it
[2773.22 --> 2774.12]  but allow this song
[2774.12 --> 2774.96]  more than anything
[2774.96 --> 2776.58]  to minister to the
[2776.58 --> 2777.78]  broken hard places
[2777.78 --> 2779.32]  of your own household
[2779.32 --> 2783.92]  land ofไม bad osoby
[2783.92 --> 2784.42]  color and basketball
[2784.42 --> 2785.04]  but allow this
[2785.04 --> 2788.70]  our Michelle
[2788.70 --> 2789.48]  importance deeper
[2789.48 --> 2790.16]  and every time
[2790.16 --> 2790.60]  for our V Miami
[2790.60 --> 2792.72]  and we're here
[2792.72 --> 2794.18]  so a lot of확in Here
[2794.18 --> 2794.88]  and the sudden
[2794.88 --> 2795.04]  in breaking off
[2795.04 --> 2796.02]  of my aussie
[2796.02 --> 2796.94]  that grab their
[2796.94 --> 2798.38] ienza
[2798.38 --> 2798.98]  of their jobs
[2798.98 --> 2799.06]  to Mitchell
[2799.06 --> 2800.00]  and the final
[2800.00 --> 2801.00]  and that
[2801.00 --> 2801.44]  Prankful of
[2801.44 --> 2801.66]  exciting
[2801.88 --> 2802.50]  and the finish
[2802.50 --> 2803.18]  of our
[2803.18 --> 2803.48]  people
[2803.48 --> 2804.88]  in this
[2804.88 --> 2805.82]  new
[2805.82 --> 2805.92]  Day
[2805.92 --> 2827.06]  Every mother, every father, call to raise up sons or daughters.
[2827.06 --> 2852.24]  May your heart be patient, may your mind be clear, may our God be with you and calm your fears.
[2857.06 --> 2862.36]  Ooh.
[2868.76 --> 2872.00]  Ooh.
[2872.00 --> 2886.00]  Every mother, every father, call to raise ό.
[2886.00 --> 2888.42]  raise up
[2888.42 --> 2889.98]  sons
[2889.98 --> 2891.98]  and daughters
[2893.16 --> 2895.98]  may your heart
[2896.50 --> 2897.98]  be patient
[2898.52 --> 2901.80]  may your mind
[2901.80 --> 2902.98]  be clear
[2902.98 --> 2907.14]  may our God
[2907.14 --> 2908.98]  be ready
[2908.98 --> 2910.98]  calm
[2910.98 --> 2912.98]  your
[2912.98 --> 2916.90]  years
[2920.78 --> 2926.82]  ooh
[2926.82 --> 2938.12]  every
[2938.86 --> 2940.82]  mother
[2940.82 --> 2956.82]  Every father called to raise up sons or daughters.
[2956.82 --> 2961.82]  May your heart be patient.
[2961.82 --> 2966.82]  May your mind be clear.
[2966.82 --> 2983.82]  May our God be with you and call your fears.
[2983.82 --> 3008.82]  May your heart be with you and call your fears.
[3008.82 --> 3016.82]  Well, now we're all going to join Bill and stand to receive God's blessing.
[3016.82 --> 3020.82]  You have heard God speak by worship and prayer and by the word.
[3020.82 --> 3025.82]  You've been equipped by him this morning so that we can go into our neighborhoods,
[3025.82 --> 3034.82]  we can go into our workplaces, and we can go into our homes to make Jesus known and embody his grace.
[3034.82 --> 3037.82]  And Jesus goes with us.
[3037.82 --> 3039.82]  You don't go in your own strength.
[3039.82 --> 3041.82]  You don't go in your own power.
[3041.82 --> 3044.82]  You go with the God who walks with you in your homes.
[3044.82 --> 3045.82]  He's with you.
[3045.82 --> 3049.82]  And I thought it would be fitting for us to finish with a benediction that comes from Hebrews.
[3049.82 --> 3053.82]  A benediction where God promises to give us what we need.
[3053.82 --> 3055.82]  So receive these words.
[3055.82 --> 3062.82]  Now, may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Christ,
[3062.82 --> 3070.82]  that great shepherd of the sheep, may he equip you with everything good for doing his will.
[3070.82 --> 3074.82]  And may he work in us what is pleasing to him through Jesus Christ,
[3074.82 --> 3077.82]  to whom be glory and honor forever and ever.
[3077.82 --> 3080.82]  And together we say, Amen.
[3080.82 --> 3087.82]  Let's sing our final song of worship together before we enjoy fellowship.
[3087.82 --> 3088.82]  Amen.
[3088.82 --> 3089.82]  Amen.
