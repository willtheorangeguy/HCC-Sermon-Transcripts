[0.00 --> 4.46]  How many of you feel nervous that I'm going to fall?
[8.98 --> 10.10]  I'm a little nervous.
[13.34 --> 16.42]  For those of you who are new, my name is Pastor Sid Vanderwood,
[16.58 --> 24.22]  and I have the privilege of offering you today God's Word and a message on that.
[24.22 --> 27.58]  And it's so good to be together.
[28.80 --> 35.70]  In this season of Lent, we've really focused on suffering, on the hardships of life.
[37.06 --> 42.34]  Christ came to meet us in the hard places of life as well as the joys of life.
[43.54 --> 48.30]  Because we all come with our joys, our sorrows, our triumphs, our struggles.
[48.30 --> 57.72]  Yesterday, this room was full of people saying goodbye to my good friend Peter Balconier,
[58.12 --> 60.86]  who passed away a week ago.
[61.84 --> 67.98]  And we had a memorial service here, and we rejoiced and had a lot of fun and a lot of laughter
[67.98 --> 70.10]  because Pete was that kind of guy.
[70.10 --> 76.36]  And we recognize that God meets us in those places of sorrow
[76.36 --> 83.36]  with the opportunity to remember that God is with us in the hard moments,
[83.44 --> 85.40]  but he brings us the hope of the future as well.
[87.46 --> 94.16]  We know that Easter joy is coming, but we can't ignore the suffering and the pain.
[94.16 --> 100.44]  And hopefully you and I will go to our Father with all that hurt and those broken places.
[100.82 --> 104.72]  And we go in prayer, and we pray for healing, and we pray for relief,
[104.84 --> 106.50]  and we pray for mending of relationships.
[107.12 --> 109.90]  We share our pain with our God.
[111.68 --> 113.80]  It's interesting to me that even in times of great suffering,
[113.90 --> 115.38]  unbelievers may be moved to prayer.
[115.48 --> 117.52]  We might even call those foxhole prayers,
[118.36 --> 121.32]  where we have a desperate prayer, we're not even sure we believe,
[121.32 --> 124.18]  but we call out to this God that we hope will help us.
[124.78 --> 128.20]  And we might cry, and we do cry out for healing and for restoration
[128.20 --> 134.04]  and for deliverance from addictions and all kinds of things we bring before the Lord.
[134.08 --> 136.46]  And we cry out again and again and again.
[138.24 --> 142.52]  And there are times in life where God just doesn't seem to hear you.
[144.70 --> 148.60]  Think of Psalm 22, where the psalmist says to God,
[148.60 --> 152.86]  My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[153.18 --> 157.64]  Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?
[158.22 --> 162.48]  My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer.
[162.58 --> 164.68]  By night, but I find no rest.
[164.88 --> 167.74]  And we hear these same words echoed with Jesus on the cross.
[167.82 --> 169.20]  In Matthew 27, we read,
[169.20 --> 174.04]  From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over the whole land.
[174.12 --> 177.10]  And about three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice,
[177.20 --> 179.26]  Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani, which means,
[179.42 --> 181.60]  My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[181.72 --> 183.90]  And he feels that way too.
[184.30 --> 185.62]  And he quotes that psalm.
[187.64 --> 189.68]  Prayer is an essential to the Christian life.
[190.68 --> 192.92]  It's a part of the road of suffering as well.
[192.92 --> 197.96]  But sometimes it feels like it adds to our suffering
[197.96 --> 201.56]  because it seems like God doesn't even hear us.
[203.20 --> 206.24]  And what do we do, and that's what I want to talk about today,
[206.70 --> 208.08]  with unanswered prayer?
[208.66 --> 212.18]  Or with prayers that don't go the way we had hoped they would?
[214.06 --> 215.44]  We're going to look at John 11.
[216.18 --> 218.14]  This is the story of Lazarus.
[218.78 --> 222.20]  Lazarus dies, and a good friend of Jesus.
[222.20 --> 226.20]  And I'm looking at it as a bit of a microcosm of us
[226.20 --> 229.68]  and our worlds and how we look for Jesus in hard times
[229.68 --> 230.44]  and hope for more.
[230.84 --> 233.22]  And we know that this story, if you know the story of Lazarus,
[233.36 --> 235.84]  it ends with Jesus crying out in front of a tomb,
[235.96 --> 237.56]  Lazarus, come forth!
[237.88 --> 239.82]  And you might hear a Carmen song in there,
[239.88 --> 241.16]  for those of you who are old enough to know that.
[241.56 --> 245.10]  And Lazarus comes out of the grave, and he lives again.
[245.44 --> 248.48]  But before we do the resurrection part,
[249.10 --> 251.72]  we are going to focus in rather this morning
[251.72 --> 254.24]  on the hurt, on the pain,
[254.24 --> 257.70]  on this feeling of tension that exists between Jesus
[257.70 --> 260.50]  and some of his closest friends.
[261.60 --> 263.42]  It's what we were doing in this Lent season.
[263.58 --> 268.88]  We're focusing in on how we feel, how we hurt,
[269.00 --> 272.08]  so that we bring all of that to Easter.
[272.08 --> 274.40]  Right?
[274.60 --> 276.28]  But we don't have to ignore that pain.
[277.06 --> 278.26]  So let's read it together.
[279.06 --> 280.36]  It's a bit of a longer piece,
[280.80 --> 285.10]  but it's worth hearing the whole context from chapter 11.
[285.10 --> 288.14]  Now, a man named Lazarus was sick.
[289.28 --> 291.26]  He was from Bethany, the village of Mary,
[291.42 --> 292.50]  and her sister Martha.
[293.06 --> 295.54]  This Mary, whose brother Lazarus is not only sick,
[295.60 --> 298.18]  was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord's feet
[298.18 --> 299.06]  and wiped it with her hair.
[299.30 --> 301.26]  We're given that kind of context because we're told
[301.26 --> 303.76]  this is someone who's intimate and close to Jesus.
[304.42 --> 304.62]  Okay?
[304.62 --> 308.12]  So the sisters sent word to Jesus,
[308.20 --> 309.40]  Lord, the one you love,
[309.62 --> 311.98]  and obviously Jesus would know who that is,
[312.14 --> 312.62]  is sick.
[312.88 --> 314.44]  And when he heard this, Jesus said,
[314.74 --> 317.00]  this sickness will not end in death.
[318.48 --> 319.88]  No, it is for the glory of God,
[320.18 --> 322.12]  so that God's Son may be glorified through it.
[322.42 --> 326.22]  Now, Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus,
[326.44 --> 328.04]  and so when he heard that Lazarus was sick,
[328.32 --> 330.92]  he stayed where he was for two more days.
[331.22 --> 333.54]  And you might think, what is going on with that?
[333.54 --> 335.98]  Come quick, hurry.
[336.94 --> 338.02]  Someone you love is sick.
[338.24 --> 339.68]  I think I'll hang out for a couple more days.
[339.92 --> 340.96]  You think, what is going on here?
[341.10 --> 344.08]  Okay, now we, and then in verse 7,
[344.96 --> 346.58]  and then he said to the disciples,
[346.68 --> 347.62]  let's go back to Judea.
[348.54 --> 349.68]  Jump ahead to verse 17.
[350.06 --> 352.06]  On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus
[352.06 --> 354.50]  had already been in the tomb for four days.
[355.20 --> 357.46]  Now, Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,
[357.58 --> 359.30]  so this wasn't that it was too far away.
[359.54 --> 361.70]  And many Jews had come to Mary and Martha
[361.70 --> 363.38]  to comfort them in the loss of their brother.
[363.98 --> 365.92]  When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,
[366.00 --> 366.76]  she went out to meet him,
[366.82 --> 368.02]  but Mary stayed home.
[368.72 --> 369.88]  There's stuff there, too.
[370.38 --> 371.86]  Lord, Martha said to Jesus,
[372.22 --> 374.50]  if you had been here,
[375.28 --> 377.08]  my brother would not have died.
[378.14 --> 379.50]  But I know that even now,
[379.58 --> 380.96]  God will give you whatever you ask.
[382.24 --> 383.20]  And she said to her,
[383.40 --> 384.62]  your brother will rise again.
[384.76 --> 386.44]  And Mary, Martha answered,
[386.54 --> 387.60]  I know he will rise again
[387.60 --> 389.84]  in the resurrection at the last day.
[389.84 --> 390.88]  And Jesus said to her,
[391.16 --> 393.40]  I am the resurrection and the life.
[393.62 --> 395.02]  The one who believes in me will live,
[395.08 --> 395.88]  even though they die.
[396.08 --> 397.62]  And whoever lives by believing in me
[397.62 --> 398.52]  will never die.
[398.82 --> 400.44]  Do you believe this?
[402.00 --> 403.36]  Yes, Lord, she replied.
[403.92 --> 405.54]  I believe that you are the Messiah,
[405.64 --> 406.24]  the Son of God,
[406.36 --> 407.78]  who is to come into the world.
[408.26 --> 409.26]  And after she said this,
[409.28 --> 412.16]  she went back and called her sister Mary aside.
[412.28 --> 413.34]  The teacher's here, she said.
[413.38 --> 414.44]  He is asking for you.
[414.44 --> 416.02]  And when Mary heard this,
[416.08 --> 417.72]  she got up quickly and went to him.
[418.10 --> 419.80]  And now Jesus had not yet entered the village,
[419.92 --> 420.68]  but was still at the place
[420.68 --> 421.88]  where Martha had met him.
[422.22 --> 423.38]  And when the Jews who had been
[423.38 --> 424.34]  with Mary in the house,
[424.66 --> 425.16]  comforting her,
[425.26 --> 426.52]  noticed how quickly she got up
[426.52 --> 427.22]  and went out,
[427.30 --> 427.94]  they followed her,
[428.02 --> 429.92]  supposing she was going to the tomb
[429.92 --> 430.80]  to mourn there.
[431.70 --> 432.88]  When Mary reached the place
[432.88 --> 434.76]  where Jesus was and saw him,
[435.02 --> 436.38]  she fell at his feet
[436.38 --> 437.86]  and said,
[437.92 --> 440.66]  Lord, if you had been here,
[440.66 --> 444.46]  my brother would not have died.
[447.12 --> 448.42]  And Jesus saw her weeping
[448.42 --> 450.02]  and the Jews who had come along
[450.02 --> 451.76]  with their also weeping.
[451.88 --> 453.60]  He was deeply moved in spirit
[453.60 --> 454.46]  and troubled.
[456.00 --> 456.92]  Where have you laid him?
[457.56 --> 458.02]  He asked.
[458.78 --> 460.12]  Come and see, Lord, they replied.
[461.26 --> 462.08]  Jesus wept.
[463.28 --> 464.10]  And then the Jews said,
[464.18 --> 465.10]  see how he loved him.
[465.58 --> 466.40]  But some of them said,
[466.40 --> 469.76]  could not he who opened the eyes of the blind
[469.76 --> 472.60]  have kept this man from dying.
[474.52 --> 477.44]  And you see this profoundly personal
[477.44 --> 479.80]  and intimate story of loss.
[484.36 --> 487.22]  Martha and Mary are close friends
[487.22 --> 488.36]  and disciples of Jesus.
[489.38 --> 491.28]  They have relational history.
[491.68 --> 493.22]  So they send word to Jesus
[493.22 --> 494.86]  about Lazarus' illness.
[495.16 --> 496.50]  Your friend is sick.
[496.98 --> 498.88]  Expecting Jesus to respond.
[498.88 --> 500.38]  Yet we read, as I said,
[500.40 --> 501.76]  he held back for two days.
[501.92 --> 502.46]  And we wonder,
[502.60 --> 503.50]  why are you waiting?
[503.60 --> 504.42]  What is going on here?
[504.70 --> 505.78]  And then in verse 17,
[505.86 --> 506.68]  we jump ahead and say,
[506.86 --> 507.80]  he's too late.
[507.92 --> 508.66]  He's been in the tomb
[508.66 --> 509.44]  for four days already.
[509.74 --> 510.64]  Lazarus has died.
[511.00 --> 512.08]  And then the community
[512.08 --> 513.52]  has even already shown up
[513.52 --> 515.54]  to help the family
[515.54 --> 516.58]  in this time of need.
[517.96 --> 518.54]  No Jesus.
[520.10 --> 521.24]  And Martha meets Jesus
[521.24 --> 522.16]  on his way to the village
[522.16 --> 522.72]  and he's saying,
[523.10 --> 524.32]  maybe with some anger.
[524.46 --> 525.38]  Maybe with some anger and hurt.
[525.38 --> 526.98]  If only you had.
[527.70 --> 530.02]  If only you had been here,
[530.12 --> 531.12]  this wouldn't have happened.
[533.14 --> 534.14]  And Martha confronts him
[534.14 --> 535.64]  with what he could have done
[535.64 --> 537.98]  and saved her brother.
[539.74 --> 540.58]  Jesus tells her,
[540.70 --> 541.96]  I am the resurrection of the life.
[542.02 --> 542.86]  Do you believe that?
[543.10 --> 543.56]  And Martha says,
[543.60 --> 544.10]  I know, I know.
[544.18 --> 545.44]  Someday he will live.
[545.72 --> 546.18]  Someday.
[546.42 --> 547.72]  But I don't want someday.
[547.84 --> 548.92]  I want this day.
[548.92 --> 551.18]  I want now.
[555.08 --> 556.78]  And we see Jesus attempt
[556.78 --> 557.94]  to expand her view
[557.94 --> 558.88]  and her perspective
[558.88 --> 560.68]  about what's really going on.
[561.08 --> 562.40]  Because you and I
[562.40 --> 563.56]  tend to be stuck
[563.56 --> 565.36]  in our moments of pain
[565.36 --> 566.10]  and suffering.
[566.40 --> 568.10]  They tend to make us myopic
[568.10 --> 569.32]  in many ways.
[570.56 --> 572.34]  And then Jesus encounters Mary.
[572.74 --> 573.64]  And I think Mary comes
[573.64 --> 575.38]  with maybe a softer tone,
[575.46 --> 576.46]  but with a lot of pain.
[576.46 --> 577.26]  And she's,
[577.38 --> 579.92]  if only you had been here.
[582.68 --> 583.78]  Maybe you have some
[583.78 --> 585.24]  if only's in your life.
[585.74 --> 588.08]  If only you had been here,
[588.42 --> 589.24]  this wouldn't happen.
[589.34 --> 590.80]  If only you had been here.
[590.86 --> 592.50]  If only you had done something.
[592.80 --> 593.60]  We could have gotten
[593.60 --> 594.56]  through that moment.
[594.80 --> 596.58]  If only you could have healed this.
[596.78 --> 597.46]  If only,
[597.78 --> 599.14]  and we have all these lists
[599.14 --> 599.94]  of if only's.
[600.52 --> 600.98]  And really,
[601.30 --> 603.60]  the situation is painful
[603.60 --> 604.90]  in so many ways,
[604.98 --> 605.56]  if only's.
[606.46 --> 607.24]  And Jesus then,
[607.46 --> 607.92]  we read,
[607.98 --> 609.32]  is moved by the spirit,
[609.44 --> 609.92]  it says here.
[610.10 --> 611.76]  He feels and knows her anguish.
[611.80 --> 611.98]  Really,
[612.28 --> 612.98]  by the spirit,
[613.12 --> 613.92]  if you translate it
[613.92 --> 614.32]  into Greek,
[614.48 --> 615.14]  we get a picture
[615.14 --> 616.36]  of becoming enraged.
[617.84 --> 618.94]  Becoming enraged.
[619.16 --> 619.86]  Like a bull.
[620.16 --> 622.56]  The situation deeply affects him.
[622.78 --> 624.12]  It angers him.
[626.40 --> 627.40]  He's angry
[627.40 --> 628.92]  at the injustice
[628.92 --> 629.96]  of brokenness.
[629.96 --> 631.84]  It's not supposed
[631.84 --> 632.96]  to be this way.
[633.34 --> 633.64]  Jesus,
[633.88 --> 634.74]  in the beginning,
[635.20 --> 635.42]  right,
[635.50 --> 635.86]  he knew,
[636.10 --> 637.20]  he created life,
[637.68 --> 639.40]  the triune God made life,
[639.58 --> 640.70]  and then suddenly
[640.70 --> 641.58]  it was ruined.
[642.12 --> 642.34]  You know,
[642.40 --> 643.48]  on the day you eat the fruit,
[643.60 --> 644.68]  you will surely die.
[644.90 --> 645.76]  You will experience
[645.76 --> 646.54]  the brokenness
[646.54 --> 647.00]  of the world.
[647.24 --> 648.02]  It's not supposed
[648.02 --> 648.88]  to be this way.
[648.88 --> 655.08]  And Jesus sees that,
[655.54 --> 656.18]  and he weeps.
[656.60 --> 656.80]  And yeah,
[656.82 --> 657.74]  he weeps for the pain
[657.74 --> 658.16]  of Mary,
[658.42 --> 659.48]  but I think he weeps
[659.48 --> 660.32]  for the brokenness
[660.32 --> 660.84]  of the world.
[661.14 --> 661.98]  This is the deep,
[662.10 --> 662.60]  this is the shortest
[662.60 --> 663.14]  verse in the Bible,
[663.36 --> 663.98]  and one of the most
[663.98 --> 664.96]  deepest verses
[664.96 --> 665.76]  in the Bible too.
[665.96 --> 666.92]  He weeps because
[666.92 --> 668.24]  the world is broken.
[668.64 --> 670.02]  That's why he's there.
[670.40 --> 671.98]  Soon he's going to die
[671.98 --> 674.08]  to begin the process
[674.08 --> 675.12]  of bringing all things
[675.12 --> 677.10]  back into the restoration
[677.10 --> 677.94]  the Father wants.
[678.88 --> 680.30]  But Jesus enters
[680.30 --> 681.52]  their pain.
[684.06 --> 685.22]  Their pain of what
[685.22 --> 686.40]  could have been,
[687.52 --> 688.94]  but what wasn't.
[689.58 --> 690.96]  The pain of loss,
[691.10 --> 691.74]  of confusion,
[691.92 --> 693.20]  of unanswered prayers.
[693.76 --> 694.44]  And at the center
[694.44 --> 695.76]  of this unanswered prayer
[695.76 --> 697.06]  and all unanswered prayers
[697.06 --> 698.98]  is a relationship.
[700.96 --> 702.02]  Deep prayer is built
[702.02 --> 702.74]  on a relationship.
[702.96 --> 704.74]  It's not a list of things.
[705.10 --> 706.34]  It's a relational thing.
[707.12 --> 708.32]  And in that space
[708.32 --> 709.32]  of prayer,
[709.66 --> 710.80]  you are invited
[710.80 --> 712.40]  to share it all.
[714.28 --> 714.80]  Father,
[715.86 --> 717.20]  if only,
[718.66 --> 721.18]  why have you forsaken me?
[721.60 --> 722.82]  You could have.
[723.46 --> 724.60]  Take this cup.
[725.60 --> 726.86]  We share it all.
[726.98 --> 728.18]  We express our pain,
[728.54 --> 729.78]  yet our hope is in the one
[729.78 --> 730.86]  we love and trust
[730.86 --> 732.20]  in the midst of our hurts.
[732.20 --> 735.26]  And Jesus weeps
[735.26 --> 736.38]  about this broken world
[736.38 --> 738.30]  because He's there
[738.30 --> 738.98]  in the pain
[738.98 --> 739.76]  weeping with us.
[740.10 --> 741.36]  He's present in the moments
[741.36 --> 743.26]  that holds out love
[743.26 --> 743.76]  and hope
[743.76 --> 744.82]  in the middle of all of it.
[745.70 --> 747.44]  He reveals the future,
[747.58 --> 748.74]  a reality without death
[748.74 --> 749.64]  and tears and pain.
[750.16 --> 751.18]  And He reminds them
[751.18 --> 751.96]  who He really is,
[752.00 --> 752.82]  the resurrection
[752.82 --> 753.56]  and the life
[753.56 --> 755.06]  without dismissing
[755.06 --> 755.72]  their pain.
[755.72 --> 758.02]  And He shows them
[758.02 --> 758.30]  and us
[758.30 --> 759.02]  that He too
[759.02 --> 759.54]  is hurt
[759.54 --> 760.50]  and angry
[760.50 --> 761.18]  at the reality
[761.18 --> 762.20]  of sin and brokenness
[762.20 --> 763.90]  knowing that He will soon
[763.90 --> 764.76]  die for it all.
[765.06 --> 765.78]  He acknowledges
[765.78 --> 766.68]  the state of the world
[766.68 --> 768.00]  as it is,
[768.80 --> 770.10]  yet pointing beyond it
[770.10 --> 770.72]  to Himself,
[771.22 --> 771.98]  the resurrected one.
[771.98 --> 775.52]  this must reshape
[775.52 --> 777.86]  our perspective
[777.86 --> 778.96]  on the realities
[778.96 --> 779.78]  that we are facing.
[781.32 --> 782.88]  I've done quite a few funerals
[782.88 --> 783.70]  in my time.
[785.34 --> 785.86]  Yesterday,
[786.02 --> 787.30]  participating in one too.
[788.40 --> 789.88]  And I've done a few services
[789.88 --> 791.08]  for non-believers.
[794.48 --> 795.66]  And they have hoped
[795.66 --> 798.02]  that it goes like this.
[798.02 --> 801.28]  He, she,
[802.36 --> 803.82]  lives on in your memory.
[805.72 --> 806.62]  And on the surface,
[806.74 --> 806.88]  you say,
[807.00 --> 808.26]  well, that's lovely
[808.26 --> 809.22]  and it's true
[809.22 --> 810.56]  to an extent.
[811.82 --> 812.20]  But, you know,
[812.24 --> 813.12]  then you're going to die
[813.12 --> 814.50]  and those memories
[814.50 --> 815.04]  go with you
[815.04 --> 816.28]  and your grandchildren
[816.28 --> 817.60]  and they'll die
[817.60 --> 818.48]  and the memories go too
[818.48 --> 819.24]  and pretty soon
[819.24 --> 820.40]  there won't even be a memory.
[820.90 --> 821.24]  And I think
[821.24 --> 822.36]  that's the beauty here.
[822.72 --> 822.84]  You know,
[822.88 --> 823.90]  when I think of my friend Pete,
[824.02 --> 824.14]  you know,
[824.22 --> 826.76]  what we celebrated yesterday
[826.76 --> 828.00]  was he doesn't,
[828.00 --> 829.78]  but, and yes,
[829.84 --> 830.98]  we had all kinds of memories,
[831.18 --> 832.04]  humorous laughter.
[832.16 --> 833.24]  There was lots of laughter
[833.24 --> 834.42]  here yesterday, right?
[834.46 --> 835.00]  Just remembering
[835.00 --> 836.62]  all the silly things
[836.62 --> 837.52]  he might have said
[837.52 --> 837.90]  or did
[837.90 --> 839.16]  that made him
[839.16 --> 839.96]  such a fun friend
[839.96 --> 840.76]  to be around too.
[841.10 --> 841.50]  But, you know,
[841.58 --> 842.70]  we celebrated
[842.70 --> 844.02]  that there was real hope.
[844.24 --> 844.34]  You know,
[844.38 --> 846.08]  Pastor Dave said it
[846.08 --> 846.88]  to the people
[846.88 --> 847.76]  that gathered here,
[848.00 --> 849.42]  the gospel truth, right?
[849.56 --> 850.90]  He lives on
[850.90 --> 851.50]  really,
[851.96 --> 852.36]  truly.
[856.00 --> 857.68]  Not just remembered,
[858.00 --> 859.00]  but he didn't
[859.00 --> 860.00]  do anything
[860.00 --> 860.32]  so much better
[860.32 --> 860.82]  than that.
[861.06 --> 863.38]  Our hope is in life eternal
[863.38 --> 865.20]  and the one who brings it
[865.20 --> 866.26]  about Jesus himself.
[866.52 --> 867.04]  Yet even though
[867.04 --> 868.32]  this is profoundly important,
[868.66 --> 870.54]  it doesn't remove the pain.
[871.06 --> 871.62]  And that's sometimes
[871.62 --> 873.90]  when we do some crazy things
[873.90 --> 877.00]  with our religious jargon sometime.
[877.00 --> 880.24]  You know,
[880.40 --> 881.36]  there was a woman yesterday
[881.36 --> 885.36]  at the service
[885.36 --> 887.28]  and a long-time friend.
[890.00 --> 890.92]  Part of hope
[890.92 --> 892.24]  in the very, very beginning
[892.24 --> 893.78]  when there was about 20 of us.
[895.44 --> 897.52]  And she lost two children
[897.52 --> 899.08]  and her husband
[899.08 --> 900.48]  over time.
[900.48 --> 903.50]  And after one of those losses,
[903.88 --> 905.34]  we were gathered together
[905.34 --> 906.48]  as a small group of people
[906.48 --> 909.30]  and somebody said to her,
[910.94 --> 911.94]  to try to bring comfort,
[912.14 --> 913.70]  the gardener picks
[913.70 --> 914.98]  the choicest blooms.
[914.98 --> 919.80]  And I wanted to punch him.
[924.40 --> 925.62]  And think about that.
[925.74 --> 926.40]  The gardener picks
[926.40 --> 927.04]  the choicest blooms
[927.04 --> 927.44]  like so.
[927.80 --> 928.86]  God just picked your kid
[928.86 --> 930.98]  because your kid is...
[932.50 --> 934.10]  It was a ridiculous thing
[934.10 --> 934.40]  to say.
[934.48 --> 935.60]  You might read it on a card,
[935.68 --> 936.54]  but it's just not true.
[938.14 --> 939.22]  We don't know why.
[939.84 --> 940.88]  We don't have to settle
[940.88 --> 941.38]  that one.
[941.38 --> 943.28]  We need to grieve
[943.28 --> 943.82]  with those
[943.82 --> 945.02]  who have lost loved ones
[945.02 --> 947.08]  and just simply grieve.
[951.36 --> 952.20]  C.S. Lewis,
[953.18 --> 954.24]  because this whole process
[954.24 --> 955.66]  is so disorienting sometimes,
[955.90 --> 956.76]  when you find people
[956.76 --> 957.58]  who are in deep pain,
[958.08 --> 958.30]  you know,
[958.36 --> 959.08]  they're trying to find
[959.08 --> 959.66]  their balance
[959.66 --> 960.86]  between hope
[960.86 --> 962.06]  and present suffering.
[962.18 --> 963.24]  They're kind of stuck there, right?
[963.68 --> 964.56]  That weird,
[964.72 --> 965.72]  uncomfortable place
[965.72 --> 966.84]  that's surreal sometimes.
[968.44 --> 969.88]  But C.S. Lewis put it this way.
[969.94 --> 970.24]  He said,
[970.24 --> 972.14]  the heart never takes place
[972.14 --> 972.64]  in the head.
[974.80 --> 975.30]  And so you say,
[975.48 --> 976.68]  all these feelings here,
[977.04 --> 977.96]  and then the things
[977.96 --> 978.62]  that I think
[978.62 --> 979.44]  and that I believe
[979.44 --> 980.10]  and I know
[980.10 --> 981.14]  in some ways,
[981.22 --> 982.08]  but sometimes this heart
[982.08 --> 983.14]  is feeling so much differently.
[983.54 --> 984.40]  And so we feel this
[984.40 --> 985.02]  and we know this
[985.02 --> 986.22]  and we do this
[986.22 --> 988.34]  disconnect somehow.
[991.94 --> 993.16]  What we think
[993.16 --> 993.50]  and believe
[993.50 --> 994.78]  doesn't always translate
[994.78 --> 995.56]  into what we feel.
[996.46 --> 997.62]  There's a chasm really
[997.62 --> 999.44]  between what will be
[999.44 --> 1001.94]  and what is right now.
[1003.36 --> 1003.84]  And so how do you
[1003.84 --> 1004.88]  close that gap?
[1005.02 --> 1006.68]  And we see Mary and Martha
[1006.68 --> 1007.50]  in their deep pain,
[1007.96 --> 1008.76]  you know,
[1008.82 --> 1009.76]  feeling abandoned
[1009.76 --> 1011.12]  by their closest friend,
[1011.20 --> 1011.42]  Jesus.
[1011.96 --> 1012.64]  If only,
[1013.20 --> 1014.16]  where were you?
[1015.82 --> 1017.04]  And they confront Jesus
[1017.04 --> 1017.76]  with their hurts.
[1017.76 --> 1020.84]  before they could receive
[1020.84 --> 1021.74]  his presence
[1021.74 --> 1022.72]  and comfort,
[1023.50 --> 1024.70]  they had to be honest
[1024.70 --> 1025.14]  with him,
[1025.46 --> 1026.10]  the only one
[1026.10 --> 1026.78]  who could have
[1026.78 --> 1029.74]  changed the situation.
[1031.30 --> 1032.70]  This is true for us too.
[1033.70 --> 1035.16]  Before we can actually
[1035.16 --> 1037.00]  be open to God's presence,
[1037.16 --> 1038.12]  we have to express
[1038.12 --> 1039.62]  the pain of an answered prayer,
[1039.98 --> 1041.50]  sharing what seems
[1041.50 --> 1042.48]  and feels like
[1042.48 --> 1043.40]  broken trust
[1043.40 --> 1044.62]  between us and God.
[1044.62 --> 1044.66]  God.
[1047.62 --> 1048.66]  I can still picture
[1048.66 --> 1050.90]  praying week after week
[1050.90 --> 1051.52]  after week
[1051.52 --> 1052.42]  for my nephew
[1052.42 --> 1053.80]  and his little
[1053.80 --> 1055.94]  two-year-old
[1055.94 --> 1057.52]  who was dying
[1057.52 --> 1059.84]  and week after week
[1059.84 --> 1060.30]  after week
[1060.30 --> 1061.14]  praying every day,
[1061.20 --> 1061.44]  every day,
[1061.50 --> 1061.78]  every day,
[1061.82 --> 1062.08]  every day,
[1062.08 --> 1062.46]  every day.
[1062.84 --> 1063.26]  And he died.
[1071.84 --> 1073.34]  We have to take that to God.
[1074.62 --> 1077.48]  We don't have to play games
[1077.48 --> 1079.10]  with God.
[1080.78 --> 1082.30]  We don't have to have platitudes.
[1082.48 --> 1083.72]  We don't have to write
[1083.72 --> 1084.78]  a hallmark card
[1084.78 --> 1085.44]  for the moment.
[1085.58 --> 1086.18]  We don't have to do
[1086.18 --> 1086.68]  any of that.
[1089.74 --> 1091.02]  We can feel sad.
[1091.14 --> 1092.40]  We can feel angry.
[1092.56 --> 1093.66]  We can feel confused.
[1093.86 --> 1095.36]  And we can say it to God.
[1097.16 --> 1098.16]  And I think often
[1098.16 --> 1099.02]  it's tethered
[1099.02 --> 1099.72]  to something else.
[1099.78 --> 1100.86]  I think it's tethered
[1100.86 --> 1102.34]  to this sense of injustice.
[1102.34 --> 1104.56]  This world
[1104.56 --> 1106.80]  isn't how it's supposed to be.
[1106.88 --> 1107.78]  There's a lot of beautiful things.
[1107.86 --> 1108.80]  I'm not knocking this over.
[1108.88 --> 1109.88]  I love lots of this world.
[1110.38 --> 1111.76]  But this world
[1111.76 --> 1113.60]  is a hard place sometimes.
[1113.82 --> 1115.30]  It is not the end yet.
[1115.48 --> 1116.96]  We live in the moment now.
[1117.36 --> 1118.74]  And we can't fix it.
[1118.98 --> 1120.20]  And we can't control it.
[1120.32 --> 1121.58]  And we sometimes suffocate
[1121.58 --> 1122.98]  in the reality of brokenness.
[1123.72 --> 1123.84]  You know,
[1123.88 --> 1125.38]  and Jesus even himself did
[1125.38 --> 1126.24]  in Gethsemane
[1126.24 --> 1126.88]  to a degree too.
[1126.92 --> 1127.74]  He was feeling overwhelmed.
[1127.74 --> 1130.66]  If we don't surrender it,
[1130.72 --> 1131.78]  if we don't share it,
[1131.88 --> 1132.72]  we're going to probably
[1132.72 --> 1134.06]  try to stuff it down
[1134.06 --> 1135.34]  and it's going to leak out
[1135.34 --> 1136.64]  in all kinds of unhealthy ways.
[1136.96 --> 1137.96]  And if we don't acknowledge
[1137.96 --> 1138.64]  our pain
[1138.64 --> 1140.26]  of unanswered prayers,
[1140.48 --> 1141.34]  we'll compromise
[1141.34 --> 1142.06]  our ability
[1142.06 --> 1143.68]  to build a deeper relationship
[1143.68 --> 1144.32]  with God
[1144.32 --> 1146.22]  and often then
[1146.22 --> 1147.30]  with one another as well.
[1147.30 --> 1152.62]  when I've grieved
[1152.62 --> 1153.32]  with people
[1153.32 --> 1156.12]  and allowed them
[1156.12 --> 1157.28]  to express their hurt
[1157.28 --> 1159.22]  without trying to
[1159.22 --> 1160.12]  tidy it up
[1160.12 --> 1161.32]  in some kind of
[1161.32 --> 1162.90]  Christian package
[1162.90 --> 1163.56]  with a bow,
[1165.10 --> 1167.80]  it's so much more honest
[1167.80 --> 1169.02]  and so much more healing.
[1171.84 --> 1173.46]  It's the only road
[1173.46 --> 1175.54]  to relational rebuilding
[1175.54 --> 1176.74]  and reconnection.
[1177.30 --> 1180.66]  We can actually admit
[1180.66 --> 1181.72]  that we have times
[1181.72 --> 1183.64]  where God seems silent
[1183.64 --> 1185.42]  and he seems distant.
[1187.66 --> 1188.94]  Listen to Psalm 13.
[1189.08 --> 1190.46]  Look how the psalmist feels here.
[1190.96 --> 1191.96]  Look at his prayer.
[1192.28 --> 1193.28]  How long, Lord,
[1193.44 --> 1195.32]  will you forget me forever?
[1195.56 --> 1196.26]  You ever pray that?
[1197.56 --> 1199.68]  Will you forget me forever?
[1202.16 --> 1203.84]  Because that's how I feel
[1203.84 --> 1205.10]  and I get to say it.
[1205.10 --> 1207.68]  How long will you hide
[1207.68 --> 1208.50]  your face from me?
[1208.68 --> 1210.02]  How long must I wrestle
[1210.02 --> 1210.82]  with my thoughts
[1210.82 --> 1212.26]  and day after day
[1212.26 --> 1213.26]  have sorrow in my heart?
[1213.44 --> 1214.70]  How long will my enemy
[1214.70 --> 1215.58]  triumph over me?
[1215.88 --> 1216.84]  Look at me, Lord.
[1217.16 --> 1218.14]  Answer me, Lord.
[1218.26 --> 1220.02]  You feel the pain in that.
[1223.46 --> 1224.64]  God doesn't want
[1224.64 --> 1225.42]  to play games
[1225.42 --> 1226.68]  with his relationship
[1226.68 --> 1227.24]  with you.
[1227.46 --> 1228.44]  Don't play games
[1228.44 --> 1229.28]  with your relationship
[1229.28 --> 1229.80]  with God.
[1229.80 --> 1231.90]  God doesn't want
[1231.90 --> 1232.46]  to play games
[1232.46 --> 1232.80]  with you.
[1232.80 --> 1233.54]  We can actually admit
[1233.54 --> 1234.28]  we have times
[1234.28 --> 1236.42]  where God feels far away.
[1238.62 --> 1239.52]  And then I think
[1239.52 --> 1240.22]  of Romans 12.
[1241.46 --> 1242.38]  Part of the process
[1242.38 --> 1242.80]  as well.
[1243.38 --> 1244.30]  Where Paul writes,
[1244.42 --> 1245.50]  be joyful in hope.
[1245.62 --> 1246.20]  Oh, okay, okay.
[1246.32 --> 1246.88]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1247.52 --> 1248.62]  Patient in affliction
[1248.62 --> 1249.88]  because it doesn't get solved.
[1250.44 --> 1251.60]  Maybe it won't get solved
[1251.60 --> 1252.30]  the way I want it all.
[1252.64 --> 1253.74]  And faithful in prayer.
[1253.74 --> 1255.10]  And I pray even
[1255.10 --> 1256.34]  when it's super hard
[1256.34 --> 1256.74]  to pray.
[1257.08 --> 1257.88]  Even when I don't
[1257.88 --> 1258.52]  feel like it.
[1258.66 --> 1259.98]  I still cry out to God
[1259.98 --> 1261.10]  because we have
[1261.10 --> 1261.90]  a relationship.
[1265.06 --> 1266.60]  And I cry out to him again
[1266.60 --> 1267.28]  and I plead
[1267.28 --> 1267.90]  and I beg
[1267.90 --> 1269.38]  and I beg God to intervene.
[1269.70 --> 1270.26]  And I might do that
[1270.26 --> 1271.56]  for a long, long time.
[1272.72 --> 1273.62]  And like the psalmist
[1273.62 --> 1274.56]  and like Mary and Martha,
[1274.88 --> 1276.10]  we tell God about our pain,
[1276.42 --> 1277.22]  about not being heard
[1277.22 --> 1277.96]  because the silence
[1277.96 --> 1278.80]  in the midst of suffering
[1278.80 --> 1279.88]  feels so wrong.
[1281.12 --> 1281.96]  I think it was C.S. Lewis
[1281.96 --> 1283.44]  where he lost
[1283.44 --> 1284.86]  he got married
[1284.86 --> 1285.62]  late in life
[1285.62 --> 1287.50]  and he lost his wife.
[1287.98 --> 1289.02]  And I think it was him
[1289.02 --> 1289.36]  who said,
[1289.78 --> 1290.54]  it wasn't that I didn't
[1290.54 --> 1291.38]  believe in God anymore
[1291.38 --> 1292.10]  as now I had to believe
[1292.10 --> 1292.50]  in a God
[1292.50 --> 1293.38]  who allowed such things
[1293.38 --> 1293.76]  to happen.
[1298.42 --> 1299.10]  That's honest.
[1300.50 --> 1301.22]  And so we speak
[1301.22 --> 1302.00]  our pain to a God
[1302.00 --> 1302.92]  because if we don't,
[1303.10 --> 1303.84]  we'll allow bitterness
[1303.84 --> 1304.54]  to creep in,
[1304.60 --> 1305.28]  we'll allow doubt
[1305.28 --> 1305.96]  to creep in,
[1306.18 --> 1307.20]  we'll become hard
[1307.20 --> 1308.56]  and hardness
[1308.56 --> 1309.34]  will define us.
[1309.48 --> 1310.44]  If you don't confront
[1310.44 --> 1311.34]  God honestly,
[1311.60 --> 1312.26]  we will create
[1312.26 --> 1313.28]  our own interpretation
[1313.28 --> 1314.04]  of God's silence
[1314.04 --> 1315.26]  will basically conclude
[1315.26 --> 1316.92]  God doesn't really care
[1316.92 --> 1318.00]  or he really can't
[1318.00 --> 1318.96]  do much about it.
[1323.54 --> 1324.52]  So C.S. Lewis,
[1324.94 --> 1325.24]  you know,
[1325.44 --> 1327.86]  he processes this
[1327.86 --> 1329.52]  in his writings,
[1329.98 --> 1330.64]  Problem of Pain,
[1330.72 --> 1331.74]  all kinds of great books,
[1331.84 --> 1332.76]  but a moment
[1332.76 --> 1333.62]  I really like
[1333.62 --> 1335.70]  is out of the Narnia series.
[1336.84 --> 1338.30]  I'm a fantasy buff
[1338.30 --> 1340.20]  and I love the Narnia series.
[1340.20 --> 1342.00]  In the Narnia series,
[1342.08 --> 1342.42]  for those of you
[1342.42 --> 1342.92]  who don't know,
[1343.40 --> 1344.90]  there's Aslan,
[1344.96 --> 1345.36]  I think there's going
[1345.36 --> 1346.06]  to be a slide up
[1346.06 --> 1348.70]  for that.
[1349.96 --> 1350.56]  There it is.
[1350.96 --> 1352.12]  Aslan is the Christ
[1352.12 --> 1352.90]  figure in the story.
[1353.86 --> 1355.50]  And this is out of the book,
[1355.64 --> 1356.52]  The Magician's Nephew,
[1356.58 --> 1357.08]  and there's this boy,
[1357.16 --> 1357.44]  Diggory,
[1357.70 --> 1358.34]  and he comes
[1358.34 --> 1359.36]  and his mom is dying.
[1359.84 --> 1360.60]  And he gets pulled
[1360.60 --> 1362.04]  into this magical land
[1362.04 --> 1362.64]  of Narnia.
[1362.64 --> 1364.46]  And he knows
[1364.46 --> 1365.12]  that Aslan
[1365.12 --> 1366.86]  is this powerful being
[1366.86 --> 1368.02]  who can solve
[1368.02 --> 1368.66]  his problems.
[1368.74 --> 1369.36]  And his problem,
[1369.70 --> 1370.58]  mom's dying.
[1370.86 --> 1373.08]  I need to ask Aslan
[1373.08 --> 1374.34]  to give me something
[1374.34 --> 1375.60]  to cure my mother.
[1376.18 --> 1376.60]  And so he,
[1376.80 --> 1377.72]  but he's nervous,
[1377.84 --> 1378.18]  you know,
[1378.22 --> 1379.02]  approaching a lion.
[1379.42 --> 1380.62]  And he walks up
[1380.62 --> 1381.48]  and his head is down
[1381.48 --> 1382.36]  and he approaches
[1382.36 --> 1382.88]  the lion
[1382.88 --> 1383.80]  and he's trying
[1383.80 --> 1384.88]  to find the courage
[1384.88 --> 1385.76]  and he took
[1385.76 --> 1386.50]  a deep breath
[1386.50 --> 1388.14]  and he nervously
[1388.14 --> 1389.10]  asks Aslan
[1389.10 --> 1390.00]  and he blurs it out,
[1390.24 --> 1391.44]  please help my mother,
[1391.72 --> 1392.32]  hoping Aslan
[1392.32 --> 1392.88]  would say yes.
[1392.96 --> 1393.96]  Fearing he might say no.
[1396.20 --> 1397.74]  And Diggory was taken aback
[1397.74 --> 1400.16]  when Aslan did neither.
[1402.22 --> 1403.44]  Aslan was silent,
[1404.36 --> 1405.72]  deafening silence.
[1407.22 --> 1407.60]  And Diggory,
[1407.72 --> 1408.48]  in his deep needs,
[1408.88 --> 1410.02]  approaches a second time.
[1410.14 --> 1411.04]  He tries to find
[1411.04 --> 1411.42]  the courage.
[1411.72 --> 1412.26]  His thoughts
[1412.26 --> 1413.34]  of his dear mother
[1413.34 --> 1413.80]  buoyed him
[1413.80 --> 1414.74]  to find that courage
[1414.74 --> 1415.38]  and that hope again.
[1415.54 --> 1416.16]  And he spoke
[1416.16 --> 1417.52]  with a lump in his throat
[1417.52 --> 1418.46]  and tears flowing
[1418.46 --> 1419.18]  and he blurted out,
[1419.48 --> 1419.88]  please,
[1420.18 --> 1421.30]  please give me
[1421.30 --> 1421.88]  something
[1421.88 --> 1422.66]  to cure
[1422.66 --> 1424.32]  my mom.
[1428.08 --> 1429.26]  And he's still silent.
[1430.68 --> 1431.58]  And he'd been looking
[1431.58 --> 1432.92]  at the lion's big paws
[1432.92 --> 1435.04]  and he looks up
[1435.04 --> 1435.90]  and he finds
[1435.90 --> 1436.52]  that lion's
[1436.52 --> 1437.68]  big tawny head
[1437.68 --> 1439.34]  and he sees tears
[1439.34 --> 1440.20]  streaming out of
[1440.20 --> 1441.66]  those big lion eyes.
[1441.66 --> 1446.88]  And Diggory thought,
[1447.06 --> 1449.62]  I think he's in more pain
[1449.62 --> 1450.24]  than I am.
[1454.58 --> 1455.62]  Aslan wept.
[1458.12 --> 1459.14]  Diggory there
[1459.14 --> 1459.64]  and Lewis
[1459.64 --> 1460.32]  through Diggory
[1460.32 --> 1461.32]  expresses
[1461.32 --> 1463.78]  the heart of God,
[1464.04 --> 1465.64]  a heart of deep compassion,
[1466.04 --> 1466.92]  of deep longing,
[1467.06 --> 1467.70]  of deep love.
[1467.70 --> 1469.02]  confronting the silence
[1469.02 --> 1470.40]  will demand
[1470.40 --> 1471.64]  courage and honesty.
[1472.02 --> 1472.54]  It will demand
[1472.54 --> 1473.14]  the courage
[1473.14 --> 1474.18]  to look into the eyes
[1474.18 --> 1474.66]  of Jesus
[1474.66 --> 1475.66]  and seeing
[1475.66 --> 1476.72]  that Jesus
[1476.72 --> 1477.80]  wept.
[1480.46 --> 1481.22]  I wonder how
[1481.22 --> 1482.52]  seeing that
[1482.52 --> 1483.42]  changed Mary.
[1483.70 --> 1484.04]  When Mary
[1484.04 --> 1485.60]  came with all that pain,
[1485.68 --> 1486.18]  she falls on
[1486.18 --> 1486.74]  in front of Jesus
[1486.74 --> 1487.84]  and then she looks up
[1487.84 --> 1488.90]  and sees her Lord,
[1489.44 --> 1490.02]  her Savior,
[1490.40 --> 1490.76]  weeping.
[1490.76 --> 1493.52]  We serve a God
[1493.52 --> 1494.62]  who weeps with us.
[1494.92 --> 1495.76]  We may not gain
[1495.76 --> 1496.22]  the clarity
[1496.22 --> 1497.46]  but we are reminded
[1497.46 --> 1498.68]  that the heart of God
[1498.68 --> 1499.58]  is deeply caring
[1499.58 --> 1500.24]  and filled with love
[1500.24 --> 1500.52]  for us.
[1501.06 --> 1502.76]  And this changes a lot,
[1502.86 --> 1503.76]  maybe not the circumstance
[1503.76 --> 1504.98]  but it does change
[1504.98 --> 1505.78]  the reality of it.
[1506.02 --> 1506.94]  And somewhere on this
[1506.94 --> 1508.64]  journey of unanswered prayer
[1508.64 --> 1510.44]  after we confront God
[1510.44 --> 1511.28]  and His silence,
[1511.52 --> 1512.50]  we can come back
[1512.50 --> 1513.22]  to the Father,
[1513.56 --> 1514.86]  the one who loves us.
[1515.04 --> 1516.24]  And we trust again,
[1516.46 --> 1517.24]  even in the pain,
[1517.50 --> 1519.26]  that He still loves us.
[1519.26 --> 1521.16]  Look at Him weep.
[1525.40 --> 1526.62]  And then maybe like Jesus,
[1526.80 --> 1527.64]  when Jesus said,
[1527.68 --> 1528.28]  Lord, take this cup,
[1528.32 --> 1528.76]  please take it,
[1528.80 --> 1529.74]  I don't want to do this.
[1529.90 --> 1530.64]  Take it, take it, take it.
[1532.18 --> 1532.78]  And He says,
[1532.86 --> 1533.86]  Father, Thy will be done
[1533.86 --> 1535.00]  and He gets to that place.
[1537.38 --> 1538.44]  And we need to learn
[1538.44 --> 1539.78]  to continually surrender,
[1540.14 --> 1540.94]  learn to see God
[1540.94 --> 1541.56]  more and more
[1541.56 --> 1542.48]  as He really is
[1542.48 --> 1543.84]  because our view of God
[1543.84 --> 1545.70]  is always too small
[1545.70 --> 1547.36]  and always too limited.
[1548.66 --> 1549.10]  Always.
[1549.26 --> 1554.14]  But a God who weeps with me,
[1554.44 --> 1556.60]  I can get my hands around that.
[1558.66 --> 1559.48]  This is a God
[1559.48 --> 1560.60]  who doesn't abandon us.
[1561.10 --> 1561.74]  This is a God
[1561.74 --> 1562.68]  who is with us
[1562.68 --> 1563.32]  in our suffering.
[1564.10 --> 1565.26]  This God who created us
[1565.26 --> 1565.94]  comes to us
[1565.94 --> 1567.26]  in all the brokenness
[1567.26 --> 1567.52]  and says,
[1567.62 --> 1568.10]  I'm with you.
[1568.28 --> 1569.16]  That's really the story
[1569.16 --> 1569.60]  of Scripture.
[1569.80 --> 1570.44]  Over and over again,
[1570.50 --> 1571.18]  God shows up again.
[1571.28 --> 1571.88]  Over and over again,
[1571.98 --> 1572.76]  God shows up again.
[1573.22 --> 1573.62]  Eventually,
[1574.00 --> 1575.26]  with this final thing
[1576.10 --> 1577.78]  of Jesus coming to us.
[1577.78 --> 1579.26]  And through Jesus,
[1579.40 --> 1580.06]  God will one day
[1580.06 --> 1580.52]  bring an end
[1580.52 --> 1581.18]  to all that pain
[1581.18 --> 1582.82]  and all that suffering.
[1583.36 --> 1583.56]  You know,
[1583.62 --> 1584.38]  we call this series,
[1584.52 --> 1585.84]  In This World You Will Have Trouble.
[1586.12 --> 1587.50]  And then that powerful word,
[1588.30 --> 1588.50]  but.
[1590.50 --> 1591.82]  And it's almost like
[1591.82 --> 1592.54]  you have the two,
[1594.00 --> 1594.26]  you know,
[1594.32 --> 1596.78]  the suffering now
[1596.78 --> 1598.12]  and the future to come
[1598.12 --> 1599.82]  and tied together with,
[1600.66 --> 1600.90]  but.
[1601.44 --> 1602.04]  Take heart.
[1602.04 --> 1602.08]  God,
[1602.60 --> 1603.68]  I've overcome the world.
[1604.72 --> 1605.72]  God is so much bigger
[1605.72 --> 1606.14]  than it all,
[1606.20 --> 1606.64]  so much bigger
[1606.64 --> 1607.34]  than our thoughts.
[1607.88 --> 1609.68]  He is what we need most.
[1610.32 --> 1611.30]  And even in our pain
[1611.30 --> 1612.70]  and our unanswered prayer,
[1612.98 --> 1613.78]  there's an invitation
[1613.78 --> 1614.94]  to know God more.
[1615.20 --> 1615.78]  And I've seen that
[1615.78 --> 1616.76]  many, many times.
[1617.00 --> 1617.68]  People coming into
[1617.68 --> 1618.60]  far deeper places
[1618.60 --> 1619.06]  with God
[1619.06 --> 1619.76]  in suffering
[1619.76 --> 1620.54]  than they ever did
[1620.54 --> 1620.90]  when everything
[1620.90 --> 1621.62]  was going their way.
[1623.92 --> 1625.68]  To know His goodness
[1625.68 --> 1626.54]  even when it doesn't
[1626.54 --> 1627.82]  match our expectations.
[1628.42 --> 1629.06]  And to remember
[1629.06 --> 1630.14]  even when it doesn't
[1630.14 --> 1630.80]  feel like it
[1630.80 --> 1632.34]  that He has overcome.
[1635.00 --> 1635.68]  We're going to have
[1635.68 --> 1636.48]  communion together
[1636.48 --> 1640.64]  as we have
[1640.64 --> 1642.52]  the last four weeks.
[1647.88 --> 1648.98]  And we celebrate
[1648.98 --> 1649.64]  this Jesus
[1649.64 --> 1650.68]  who comes to us
[1650.68 --> 1651.78]  and answers it all.
[1652.60 --> 1653.54]  And let me assure you,
[1653.62 --> 1655.08]  whatever you are
[1655.08 --> 1656.54]  dealing with right now,
[1656.72 --> 1657.82]  Jesus is there.
[1659.32 --> 1660.42]  I read this quote
[1660.42 --> 1661.14]  of someone who was
[1661.14 --> 1662.02]  going through a rough time
[1662.02 --> 1662.34]  and it said,
[1662.56 --> 1663.74]  there is hope for someday
[1663.74 --> 1664.82]  but someday is not now.
[1665.30 --> 1667.12]  But Jesus is there now
[1667.12 --> 1668.38]  in that place.
[1670.40 --> 1672.08]  We live between that now
[1672.08 --> 1672.60]  and someday,
[1672.76 --> 1673.68]  the yet and not yet.
[1673.96 --> 1674.86]  We live here
[1674.86 --> 1676.78]  before all the heartache
[1676.78 --> 1677.18]  is over.
[1678.30 --> 1679.52]  Jesus said at one time,
[1679.56 --> 1680.10]  and I'm going to read it
[1680.10 --> 1680.54]  to you,
[1681.64 --> 1682.62]  out of Luke 12,
[1682.70 --> 1682.94]  He said,
[1683.04 --> 1684.80]  consider the ravens.
[1685.00 --> 1686.36]  They don't sow or reap.
[1686.46 --> 1687.36]  They have no storerooms
[1687.36 --> 1688.00]  or barns yet.
[1688.00 --> 1688.86]  God feeds them.
[1689.68 --> 1690.60]  And how much more valuable
[1690.60 --> 1691.80]  are you than birds?
[1693.18 --> 1694.30]  Who of you by worrying
[1694.30 --> 1695.28]  can add a single hour
[1695.28 --> 1695.80]  to your life
[1695.80 --> 1696.84]  since you cannot do
[1696.84 --> 1697.54]  this very little thing?
[1697.62 --> 1698.98]  Why do you worry
[1698.98 --> 1699.62]  about the rest?
[1699.98 --> 1701.88]  Consider how the wild flowers grow.
[1702.26 --> 1703.44]  They do not labor or spin,
[1703.52 --> 1704.52]  yet not even Solomon
[1704.52 --> 1705.34]  in all his splendor
[1705.34 --> 1706.26]  was dressed like one of these.
[1706.60 --> 1707.56]  If that is how God
[1707.56 --> 1708.98]  clothes the grass of the field
[1708.98 --> 1709.82]  which is here today
[1709.82 --> 1711.10]  and gone tomorrow
[1711.10 --> 1712.22]  and is thrown in the fire,
[1712.28 --> 1712.74]  how much more
[1712.74 --> 1713.58]  will He clothe you,
[1713.78 --> 1714.98]  you of little faith?
[1714.98 --> 1716.72]  Why do I put that verse
[1716.72 --> 1717.26]  here in communion?
[1718.56 --> 1718.80]  You know,
[1718.84 --> 1719.60]  I was thinking about that.
[1719.88 --> 1720.84]  You think of birds
[1720.84 --> 1721.64]  and flowers
[1721.64 --> 1723.30]  and grass
[1723.30 --> 1723.80]  and so on.
[1723.80 --> 1724.72]  So what was Jesus saying?
[1724.92 --> 1726.16]  He wasn't pointing
[1726.16 --> 1727.56]  to the infiniteness
[1727.56 --> 1728.28]  of those things.
[1728.50 --> 1730.18]  He was pointing more
[1730.18 --> 1732.00]  to God's attentiveness.
[1733.28 --> 1734.78]  God's there with the birds
[1734.78 --> 1735.46]  and the flowers
[1735.46 --> 1736.22]  and the grass.
[1737.20 --> 1739.20]  He's in all of that
[1739.20 --> 1741.62]  as He's in all of our lives.
[1741.96 --> 1743.72]  He's attentive to us.
[1743.72 --> 1743.76]  Jesus,
[1744.56 --> 1747.90]  no matter what's keeping you up
[1747.90 --> 1748.28]  at night
[1748.28 --> 1750.02]  or what feels overwhelming to you,
[1750.76 --> 1752.12]  God has not left your side.
[1752.32 --> 1753.90]  He has not forgotten you
[1753.90 --> 1755.34]  and then I guess
[1755.34 --> 1756.58]  that's why we're having communion.
[1756.82 --> 1757.46]  Not I guess.
[1757.62 --> 1758.32]  Silly thing to say,
[1758.38 --> 1758.62]  isn't it?
[1760.64 --> 1761.38]  Jesus said,
[1762.44 --> 1765.04]  do this in remembrance of me
[1765.04 --> 1767.22]  because this is my body
[1767.22 --> 1768.12]  for you.
[1768.46 --> 1770.14]  This body is for you.
[1770.40 --> 1771.40]  I weep with you,
[1771.48 --> 1772.08]  Jesus said.
[1772.22 --> 1773.28]  I'm with you.
[1773.72 --> 1776.62]  He said,
[1776.78 --> 1777.48]  this is my blood
[1777.48 --> 1779.98]  poured out for you.
[1781.08 --> 1783.04]  Wash away all the messiness
[1783.04 --> 1784.42]  that you have in your life.
[1784.94 --> 1786.84]  I'm with you.
[1786.84 --> 1792.24]  I'm going to invite you
[1792.24 --> 1793.68]  to come up
[1793.68 --> 1795.68]  but this is how we're going to do that.
[1796.10 --> 1796.74]  I'm going to invite you
[1796.74 --> 1798.72]  to come up the center aisle.
[1799.00 --> 1800.16]  Here's the table with the bread
[1800.16 --> 1801.34]  and you have this sense of
[1801.34 --> 1803.94]  the fullness of God here.
[1804.38 --> 1806.02]  There's a feast to spread.
[1806.20 --> 1807.24]  It is Jesus' fullness
[1807.24 --> 1808.74]  is what we're trying to show you here.
[1809.22 --> 1811.52]  You can grab a chunk of bread.
[1811.84 --> 1813.52]  You can take it to your seats
[1813.52 --> 1814.62]  and break it up
[1814.62 --> 1816.18]  with those people around you there,
[1816.28 --> 1816.68]  your friends,
[1816.78 --> 1817.22]  your families
[1817.22 --> 1818.96]  and grab some juice
[1818.96 --> 1819.72]  and you know,
[1819.78 --> 1820.76]  or even have a little more juice.
[1820.88 --> 1821.22]  Just this,
[1821.36 --> 1822.02]  we want you to see
[1822.02 --> 1823.96]  fullness of Jesus' presence
[1823.96 --> 1824.64]  in your life.
[1825.42 --> 1826.96]  We symbolically share that
[1826.96 --> 1828.24]  with you in this way.
[1828.24 --> 1831.28]  And then when you sit down,
[1833.22 --> 1834.02]  I'll say it now,
[1834.64 --> 1837.06]  then take, eat, drink,
[1837.30 --> 1838.36]  remember and believe
[1838.36 --> 1840.42]  that you are united in love
[1840.42 --> 1841.24]  with our God
[1841.24 --> 1843.14]  who came to suffer and die
[1843.14 --> 1845.16]  that you might have life
[1845.16 --> 1846.18]  in all its fullness.
[1847.18 --> 1848.38]  I invite you to come.
