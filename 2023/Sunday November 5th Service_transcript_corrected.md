[0.00 → 8.26] Well, as Pastor Sid already mentioned, we are going to be starting a new sermon series
[8.26 → 9.72] on the book of Ruth.
[10.48 → 16.80] And we're going to look at this very packed little love story that has a lot of depth
[16.80 → 21.08] to it over the next four weeks, and that's actually going to segue us right into Advent.
[21.24 → 23.94] And you'll see how Ruth actually leads us to Advent quite seamlessly.
[24.72 → 25.76] But I'm really curious.
[25.88 → 29.30] I need to know, how many of us have ever heard a sermon on the book of Ruth?
[30.12 → 31.06] By show of hands.
[32.28 → 32.88] Oh, okay.
[33.38 → 36.12] When I asked our staff that this week, it was like nobody.
[36.32 → 37.24] So I thought it was unique.
[37.32 → 41.10] But apparently you've all been around, and you've heard good sermons on Ruth, so it's not as fresh to you.
[42.14 → 49.14] I'm going to read the full chapter, the first chapter, because it's so good and rich that I couldn't just pick a section of it.
[49.20 → 50.98] So if you have your Bible, turn with me to Ruth.
[51.50 → 54.36] It's sandwiched between the book of Judges and Samuel.
[55.16 → 58.82] And it's, I wish I could give you a page number, but we all have different pages in our Bibles.
[58.82 → 60.36] Ruth chapter 1.
[60.36 → 66.26] In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land.
[67.04 → 73.10] So a man from Bethlehem and Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab.
[73.88 → 79.38] The man's name was Abimelech, and his wife's name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Maldon and Ilion.
[80.20 → 84.26] They were Phragmites from Bethlehem, Judah, and they went to Moab and lived there.
[84.26 → 89.26] Now, Abimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.
[90.14 → 93.24] They married Mobile women, one named Oprah and the other Ruth.
[94.06 → 98.58] After they had lived there about ten years, both Maldon and Ilion also died.
[99.54 → 102.70] Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.
[102.70 → 109.18] When Naomi heard in Moab that the Lord had come to aid of his people by providing food for them,
[109.36 → 112.72] she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.
[113.54 → 119.04] With her two daughters-in-law, she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.
[119.90 → 122.06] Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law,
[122.06 → 124.52] Go back, each of you, to your mother's homes.
[125.08 → 129.16] May the Lord show you kindness, if you have shown kindness to your dead and to me.
[129.90 → 133.74] May the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.
[134.62 → 138.02] Then she kissed them goodbye, and they wept aloud and said to her,
[138.52 → 140.32] We will go back with you to your people.
[141.56 → 143.78] But Naomi said, Return home, my daughters.
[144.12 → 145.32] Why would you come with me?
[145.86 → 148.40] Am I going to have more sons who could become your husbands?
[149.12 → 150.40] Return home, my daughters.
[150.40 → 152.98] I am too old to have another husband.
[153.12 → 158.32] And even if there was still hope for me, even if I had a husband tonight and gave birth to sons,
[158.54 → 160.22] would you wait until they grew up?
[160.60 → 162.28] Would you remain unmarried for them?
[162.78 → 163.10] No.
[163.56 → 168.98] My daughters, it is more bitter for me than for you, because the Lord's hand has turned against me.
[170.14 → 172.08] At this they wept aloud again.
[173.38 → 175.06] Then Oprah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye.
[176.10 → 177.42] But Ruth clung to her.
[178.18 → 179.48] Look, said Naomi.
[179.48 → 182.62] Your sister-in-law is going back to her people and to her gods.
[182.98 → 184.00] Go back with her.
[185.02 → 185.94] But Ruth replied,
[186.82 → 189.58] Don't urge me to leave you or turn back from you.
[190.08 → 191.62] Where you go, I will go.
[192.10 → 193.78] And where you stay, I will stay.
[194.34 → 198.40] Your people will be my people, and your God, my God.
[198.98 → 200.48] Where you die, I will die.
[200.56 → 202.36] And there I will be buried.
[203.12 → 205.94] May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely,
[205.94 → 209.36] if even death separates you and me.
[210.36 → 214.74] When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.
[214.74 → 218.60] So the two women went until they came to Bethlehem.
[219.12 → 222.26] When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them.
[222.48 → 224.88] And the women exclaimed, Can this be Naomi?
[226.14 → 228.10] Don't call me Naomi, she told them.
[228.60 → 232.48] Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made life very bitter.
[232.48 → 236.70] I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty.
[237.18 → 238.44] Why call me Naomi?
[239.08 → 240.68] The Lord has afflicted me.
[241.06 → 243.64] The Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.
[244.74 → 247.90] So Naomi returned from Moab, accompanied by Ruth the Mobile,
[248.36 → 252.74] her daughter-in-law arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
[252.74 → 261.56] Well, a few years ago now, my wife and I watched a movie called The Children of Men.
[262.42 → 266.48] The Children of Men is this sort of futuristic, a bit apocalyptic movie
[266.48 → 268.20] where there's a global catastrophe.
[269.02 → 271.66] But the catastrophe isn't like a war or a famine.
[272.16 → 274.56] It is that women are no longer able to have babies.
[275.44 → 278.46] And as a result, the population goes in rapid decline,
[278.66 → 280.08] people fall into despair,
[280.08 → 282.34] and then there's violence and chaos as a result.
[283.46 → 286.96] The plot orients around this one young woman who is pregnant.
[288.04 → 291.58] And the whole plot really is about keeping her safe from all the chaos and violence
[291.58 → 295.72] so that she can bring this baby to full term and give hope to people around her.
[296.68 → 297.90] Now, there's a bit of a spoiler alert,
[298.04 → 301.50] but the end of the movie shows her holding this child.
[301.60 → 302.32] She has the baby.
[302.46 → 305.06] It's this very intimate moment of, in this chaotic world,
[305.16 → 306.56] this mom gets to hold her baby.
[307.18 → 310.84] And yet, as you watch it, you can't help but think there are layers to this story
[310.84 → 313.52] where on the one hand, yes, a mom gets to hold her baby.
[313.60 → 317.40] But on a deeper, more substantial level, the world gets hope.
[317.82 → 321.22] This baby represents something more than just beyond her own story.
[321.22 → 327.70] I share this story because I think it's going to help us understand the book of Ruth as a whole.
[328.72 → 333.36] The book of Ruth, on one level, is a story of just one family.
[333.36 → 336.32] A family that went through a great crisis and tragedy,
[336.48 → 340.18] but then there's hope and there's a new life given to this family
[340.18 → 342.04] and it ends with a baby being born.
[342.88 → 344.82] But we realize that this story's got layers
[344.82 → 348.16] because not only does God sort of provide for this one family
[348.16 → 349.36] and show his goodness to them,
[349.40 → 352.16] but it's through that family that God provides for his people.
[353.04 → 354.42] God shows favour to a family,
[354.50 → 356.84] and through that family, he shows favour in the bigger scheme
[356.84 → 360.08] to his own people and his plan for the world as well.
[360.08 → 364.24] Now, my goal this morning, it feels ambitious to me,
[364.34 → 365.26] but we'll see how I do.
[365.60 → 367.58] My goal is to overview the whole book of Ruth,
[367.68 → 368.82] and I hope that will be helpful.
[368.92 → 370.84] Not everyone reads the book of Ruth.
[370.94 → 372.14] It's a small book in the Old Testament,
[372.24 → 373.26] so I want to overview it.
[373.64 → 374.60] I want to ask,
[374.76 → 377.36] why in the world this tiny little love story
[377.36 → 379.28] is even in the Bible in the first place
[379.28 → 381.04] and why it is where it is?
[381.60 → 385.52] And then I want to show how the first chapter really unfolds
[385.52 → 387.70] and opens up the plot that we're going to walk through
[387.70 → 388.68] for the next four weeks.
[390.08 → 392.22] So a good question to ask of any book of the Bible
[392.22 → 394.42] is why in the world is it in the Bible?
[394.70 → 396.58] Like, why is this cute romance,
[396.68 → 399.68] this Christian romance story of Ruth in the Old Testament?
[399.84 → 400.70] And more importantly,
[401.18 → 403.26] why is it right after the book of Judges?
[404.06 → 405.44] Now, a month or so ago,
[405.58 → 407.34] I audio-booked my way through Judges,
[407.60 → 409.70] and let me tell you, that book is intense.
[409.98 → 411.30] Has anyone read the book of Judges lately?
[412.30 → 414.34] If Judges were on your Spotify playlist,
[414.34 → 416.24] it would have the red E beside it.
[416.24 → 417.98] It's an explicit book,
[418.04 → 420.58] and it gets worse and worse and worse.
[420.70 → 423.12] It starts with God placing his people in Canaan.
[423.50 → 425.60] They are supposed to be a light to the nations
[425.60 → 427.10] to reveal the goodness of God
[427.10 → 428.76] and the place that God's given them,
[429.10 → 430.94] but they just totally descend
[430.94 → 432.90] into a train wreck of disobedience,
[433.24 → 434.94] of chaos and violence.
[435.38 → 438.20] And Judges ends on an awful, violent note.
[438.72 → 439.60] And then you get Ruth.
[439.60 → 442.36] And you wonder, like, why is Ruth there?
[442.46 → 444.44] Is it like this romantic relief
[444.44 → 447.08] after the heaviness of war and violence and Judges?
[447.14 → 449.62] Like, what is Ruth doing right after Judges?
[449.96 → 451.26] And I want to help us see,
[451.48 → 452.84] through the last words of Judges
[452.84 → 454.16] and the last words of Ruth,
[454.70 → 456.38] how these books thread together
[456.38 → 458.78] and how they both fit into the bigger story of the Bible.
[459.90 → 462.48] The book of Judges ends with these very interesting
[462.48 → 466.38] and almost judging words over God's people's activity.
[467.08 → 468.96] After some terrible stuff that happens,
[468.96 → 471.00] we read this at the very end of Judges.
[471.10 → 473.28] In those days, Israel had no king.
[474.36 → 476.44] Everyone did as they saw fit,
[476.76 → 477.70] and it was not good.
[478.62 → 480.82] Now, the book of Ruth ends, spoiler alert,
[481.02 → 482.12] with a baby being born,
[482.46 → 483.88] and then they hold this baby,
[483.96 → 484.98] and then there's a genealogy,
[485.08 → 486.58] which feels so, like, you know, innocent,
[486.70 → 487.98] but this genealogy is very deep
[487.98 → 490.28] because we're told at the end of Ruth,
[490.76 → 493.02] Boaz is the father of Bed.
[493.78 → 495.42] Bed is the father of Jesse,
[495.42 → 497.14] and Jesse is the father of David,
[497.34 → 498.58] and who does David become?
[499.74 → 500.44] The king.
[501.20 → 504.24] And so the book of Ruth answers the great problem of Judges,
[504.30 → 505.20] where they don't have a king.
[505.32 → 508.16] It's this lawless, chaotic, thug-rule nation,
[508.36 → 509.70] and now they're going to be getting a king
[509.70 → 511.42] who sort of brings into order
[511.42 → 514.78] this unruly and reckless nation that is Israel.
[514.78 → 517.20] So see the layers now, right?
[517.26 → 518.98] You've got Ruth, which is, in one sense,
[519.02 → 521.52] is God showing his love and his care and his provision
[521.52 → 524.44] for this one family that's deeply broken and hurt
[524.44 → 525.28] in a variety of ways,
[525.42 → 527.26] but through that family then,
[527.78 → 529.38] showing provision for Israel
[529.38 → 531.72] and showing how God's going to lead Israel,
[531.84 → 533.80] this nation that desperately needs leadership.
[534.92 → 536.86] And if you want me to summarize the whole book of Ruth
[536.86 → 538.28] in sort of sentence or two,
[538.28 → 542.04] it's God bringing healing and hope to a family,
[542.84 → 544.34] and through that family,
[544.46 → 546.74] bringing healing and hope to a people.
[547.48 → 548.40] That's the story of Ruth.
[548.76 → 550.08] Healing and hope to a family,
[550.40 → 551.40] and through that family,
[551.56 → 552.96] healing and hope to his people.
[552.96 → 554.32] And I want us to marvel,
[554.40 → 556.04] we'll do this today and in future sermons,
[556.46 → 559.46] at the amazing, sovereign work of God
[559.46 → 560.98] who's just threading things together.
[561.40 → 562.66] He's accomplishing his purpose
[562.66 → 564.72] through very ordinary events
[564.72 → 567.14] to accomplish what he wants to accomplish
[567.14 → 568.34] for his people and his world.
[569.98 → 571.44] Now, I think it's helpful sometimes
[571.44 → 572.64] to see the structure of a book,
[573.10 → 574.02] and so I'll put on the screen
[574.02 → 574.86] the structure of Ruth,
[574.96 → 577.46] which actually reminds me of Jonah a few months ago.
[577.96 → 579.90] Four chapters divided up in this way.
[580.12 → 581.52] There's a prologue in chapter one
[581.52 → 584.42] that shows the misery and the emptiness of Naomi.
[585.02 → 586.02] And then in chapter one,
[586.14 → 587.46] you have Naomi returning home
[587.46 → 589.22] with her daughter-in-law, Ruth.
[590.00 → 592.14] In chapter two, the sparks begin to fly,
[592.32 → 594.40] and Ruth meets Boaz on the threshing floor.
[595.16 → 596.38] Chapter three is where,
[596.80 → 598.04] like all good mothers-in-law,
[598.52 → 599.94] Naomi hatches a plan for Ruth
[599.94 → 601.38] to find a husband and a home.
[601.84 → 602.84] And in chapter four,
[603.30 → 604.60] Ruth and Boaz get hitched,
[604.68 → 605.40] they have a baby,
[605.56 → 606.62] and then there's the epilogue
[606.62 → 608.42] where there's the satisfaction of a child,
[608.78 → 609.94] there's a hope for a nation.
[609.94 → 611.76] That's where we're going to be going
[611.76 → 613.18] over the next four weeks.
[614.44 → 617.66] But now, I want us to focus on chapter one.
[618.78 → 620.04] The first five books,
[620.38 → 622.14] first five chapter verses
[622.14 → 623.78] of the book of Ruth
[623.78 → 624.86] open up the whole plot.
[625.38 → 627.60] And it starts with this family from Israel,
[628.28 → 629.20] husband and wife,
[629.44 → 630.92] Abimelech and Naomi,
[631.22 → 632.24] and they have two sons.
[632.68 → 634.14] Their sons are Malian and Kilian.
[634.72 → 636.30] There's a famine in Israel
[636.30 → 637.20] that's so severe
[637.20 → 639.68] that Abimelech takes his whole family down
[639.68 → 640.88] or over to Moab,
[641.00 → 642.50] which by the way is not a safe place.
[642.88 → 644.18] They are no friends of Israel,
[644.34 → 645.68] so it was a very risky decision.
[646.42 → 647.64] And then it's in that place
[647.64 → 649.50] where things go from bad to worse.
[650.74 → 651.96] The bad is that, you know,
[652.08 → 654.30] first Naomi loses her husband, Abimelech,
[654.36 → 654.90] he dies.
[656.02 → 656.54] And therefore,
[656.66 → 658.60] she's now totally dependent on her sons.
[658.80 → 659.80] Her sons would be the ones
[659.80 → 661.26] who were in charge in the ancient world
[661.26 → 662.06] to take care of her,
[662.38 → 663.74] to make sure she's provided for.
[663.74 → 665.50] But then both of her sons,
[665.64 → 666.62] Malian and Kilian,
[666.86 → 667.20] die.
[668.30 → 669.70] And Naomi is now facing
[669.70 → 671.56] what I believe is unspeakable grief,
[671.80 → 672.00] right?
[672.60 → 673.56] She lost her home.
[674.38 → 675.26] She lost her husband.
[675.74 → 676.68] She lost her children.
[676.82 → 678.06] She lost her family line.
[678.16 → 679.14] She lost her security.
[679.50 → 680.42] She has lost
[680.42 → 683.10] an unspeakable amount of things.
[683.46 → 684.40] And sometimes when you read
[684.40 → 685.06] books of the Bible,
[685.46 → 687.28] you cannot get into the emotion of it,
[687.34 → 688.34] but I want us to pause
[688.34 → 689.12] and just realize
[689.12 → 690.50] what Naomi is experiencing
[690.50 → 692.92] is far more than any one of us
[692.92 → 694.52] probably experiences in a life.
[694.62 → 695.50] Some of us know the death
[695.50 → 696.18] of a loved one
[696.18 → 697.40] or a child
[697.40 → 698.32] or a parent.
[698.40 → 699.08] You know that grief.
[699.20 → 700.42] Imagine being a child,
[700.74 → 701.36] another child,
[701.40 → 702.16] and then your husband.
[702.70 → 703.38] It's painful.
[703.48 → 704.92] And then she's living far from home.
[705.22 → 706.36] This is an unspeakable grief
[706.36 → 707.48] that will help us understand
[707.48 → 708.42] her bitterness.
[709.86 → 710.90] In verse 6
[710.90 → 712.58] is where we see a shift take place.
[713.14 → 714.36] Naomi learns that there is
[714.36 → 715.84] food being provided by God
[715.84 → 716.94] for her own people in Israel.
[716.94 → 718.90] So she then packs up her stuff
[718.90 → 720.84] along with her two daughters-in-law,
[721.00 → 721.78] Oprah and Ruth,
[722.02 → 722.96] and they together
[722.96 → 724.68] move back up to Israel.
[725.38 → 726.38] But interestingly,
[726.94 → 727.80] even strangely,
[728.30 → 729.92] after the daughters-in-law,
[730.64 → 731.36] Oprah and Ruth,
[731.48 → 732.42] pack up their stuff,
[733.32 → 734.38] Naomi then turns to them
[734.38 → 735.20] while they're on the road
[735.20 → 736.08] and Naomi says,
[736.54 → 737.50] Oprah and Ruth,
[738.00 → 739.44] don't do this.
[740.00 → 741.36] Don't come back with me.
[741.64 → 742.90] I want you to find
[742.90 → 744.04] Mobile husbands.
[744.26 → 745.04] I want you to worship
[745.04 → 745.90] your Mobile gods.
[745.90 → 747.14] It's going to be way harder
[747.14 → 747.92] for you in Israel.
[748.08 → 748.88] You're not going to be able
[748.88 → 750.46] to enjoy finding a husband.
[750.58 → 751.42] It's going to be an outsider
[751.42 → 752.24] experience for you.
[752.38 → 754.22] Stay here in Moab.
[755.46 → 756.34] And initially,
[756.96 → 757.64] Oprah says,
[758.24 → 759.20] no, I want to go with you.
[759.60 → 760.46] But then she realizes
[760.46 → 761.62] the wisdom of what Ruth is,
[761.78 → 762.68] or Naomi is saying,
[762.72 → 763.06] and she says,
[763.14 → 764.30] okay, I'm going to stay here
[764.30 → 764.70] in Moab,
[765.14 → 766.10] find myself a husband.
[766.48 → 767.10] I'm going to worship
[767.10 → 768.08] my Mobile gods.
[768.98 → 769.90] But not Ruth.
[770.78 → 772.38] Ruth has a very visceral
[772.38 → 773.66] and strong response.
[773.86 → 775.36] Ruth clings to Naomi.
[775.90 → 777.10] She has no responsibility
[777.10 → 778.56] or obligation to do so.
[778.96 → 780.20] And for the first time in Ruth,
[780.74 → 781.46] Ruth speaks.
[781.84 → 782.98] I want to read for you again
[782.98 → 784.50] this profound statement
[784.50 → 785.38] that Ruth makes
[785.38 → 786.30] to her mother-in-law.
[787.42 → 787.86] She writes,
[787.86 → 789.36] Do not urge me to leave you
[789.36 → 790.50] or to turn back from you.
[791.16 → 791.78] Where you go,
[791.88 → 792.54] I will go.
[793.02 → 793.86] Where you stay,
[794.02 → 794.74] I will stay.
[795.26 → 796.82] Your people will be my people
[796.82 → 797.68] and your God,
[798.10 → 798.80] my God.
[799.14 → 799.84] Where you die,
[799.92 → 800.54] I will die
[800.54 → 801.90] and there I will be buried.
[802.30 → 803.66] May the Lord deal with me,
[803.78 → 805.30] be it ever so severely,
[805.46 → 806.64] if even death
[806.64 → 808.52] separates you and me.
[809.18 → 809.70] And if you want to be
[809.70 → 810.90] really impressed by this,
[811.28 → 812.56] most scholars estimate
[812.56 → 813.60] that Ruth is probably
[813.60 → 814.40] a late teen
[814.40 → 816.04] or early 20s young woman.
[816.04 → 817.54] And here she is making
[817.54 → 819.48] this profound statement
[819.48 → 820.38] of commitment
[820.38 → 821.02] to her mother-in-law
[821.02 → 822.06] and even more deeply,
[822.50 → 823.68] a profound statement
[823.68 → 824.38] of faith.
[825.00 → 825.66] There's no reason
[825.66 → 826.44] to think that Ruth
[826.44 → 828.00] wasn't an ordinary Mobile
[828.00 → 829.22] worshipping ordinary gods
[829.22 → 830.24] and here she is
[830.24 → 832.54] almost as a conversion statement.
[833.26 → 833.94] Saying to Naomi,
[834.08 → 835.26] I'm not just committed to you,
[835.62 → 836.90] I'm committed to your people
[836.90 → 838.68] and I'm committed to your God
[838.68 → 840.06] and I'm so bold as to say,
[840.38 → 841.76] may the God that you worship,
[841.86 → 842.48] the God of Israel,
[843.00 → 843.88] judge me
[843.88 → 845.26] if I don't honour you
[845.26 → 845.94] with this commitment
[845.94 → 847.24] and not let anything
[847.24 → 848.82] but the grave separate us.
[849.50 → 850.48] What a profound statement.
[851.22 → 852.58] And she had no promise
[852.58 → 854.22] of things going well for her.
[854.30 → 854.98] It's not like Naomi
[854.98 → 855.92] is trying to convince her
[855.92 → 857.18] that she'd have some good life
[857.18 → 857.80] with a husband
[857.80 → 858.72] and everything was going
[858.72 → 859.68] to fall together for her.
[860.00 → 861.14] She had no one telling her
[861.14 → 861.96] this was a good idea.
[862.06 → 863.52] She simply made the commitment
[863.52 → 865.28] and she had a sense
[865.28 → 866.06] that this is what needed
[866.06 → 866.60] to be done.
[867.74 → 868.74] And from that point on,
[868.82 → 870.10] both Ruth and Naomi
[870.10 → 872.24] were going to learn together
[872.24 → 874.80] that the God whom she swore by,
[875.18 → 876.04] a God she probably
[876.04 → 877.04] didn't know well,
[877.54 → 878.56] was going to show up
[878.56 → 879.28] in grace,
[879.92 → 880.68] in love,
[881.34 → 881.76] provision,
[882.32 → 882.96] and care.
[885.46 → 886.36] And so with that,
[887.04 → 887.84] Ruth and Naomi
[887.84 → 889.16] both make the move
[889.16 → 891.16] back to Israel.
[892.16 → 893.72] And I want us to notice
[893.72 → 895.32] how this chapter ends.
[895.36 → 896.46] It doesn't actually focus on Ruth.
[896.52 → 897.88] This chapter focuses on Naomi.
[898.42 → 899.70] So they get back to Bethlehem.
[899.88 → 901.12] Naomi's seen by her community.
[901.12 → 901.64] Everyone's like,
[901.74 → 902.96] whoa, Naomi's back.
[903.22 → 904.62] But listen to the strong words
[904.62 → 905.78] this chapter finishes with.
[905.82 → 906.52] I'll read them again.
[906.94 → 908.50] When people realize who she is,
[908.56 → 909.68] she says to her community,
[910.14 → 911.40] do not call me Naomi.
[912.50 → 913.64] Call me Mara
[913.64 → 915.16] because the Almighty
[915.16 → 916.32] has made my life
[916.32 → 917.58] very bitter.
[918.34 → 919.46] I went away full,
[919.82 → 920.26] but the Lord
[920.26 → 921.36] has brought me back empty.
[921.78 → 922.90] Why call me Naomi?
[923.24 → 924.50] The Lord has afflicted me.
[924.58 → 925.92] The Almighty has brought
[925.92 → 927.66] misfortune upon me.
[927.66 → 930.42] Now, it's clear,
[930.50 → 931.12] I think you can see
[931.12 → 931.72] from these words,
[931.86 → 932.86] that Naomi doesn't think
[932.86 → 934.06] that all the devastation
[934.06 → 934.86] she's experienced
[934.86 → 935.98] is accidental.
[936.64 → 937.12] She doesn't think
[937.12 → 938.14] it's just bad luck
[938.14 → 938.88] that she's going through
[938.88 → 939.44] what she's going through.
[939.64 → 941.22] She looks squarely at God
[941.22 → 941.58] and says,
[942.12 → 943.40] you brought this upon me.
[944.30 → 945.10] You are the one
[945.10 → 945.84] who's afflicted me
[945.84 → 947.16] and I'm going to tell you
[947.16 → 948.74] that this is how I feel
[948.74 → 949.30] in my bitterness
[949.30 → 950.18] and my pain.
[950.66 → 951.82] And can we blame Naomi?
[952.62 → 953.54] Can we blame her
[953.54 → 954.06] for her bitterness?
[954.82 → 955.02] I mean,
[955.04 → 956.08] she's lost so much,
[956.12 → 956.60] her home,
[956.74 → 957.22] her family,
[957.32 → 957.84] her security,
[957.96 → 958.38] her husband,
[958.48 → 958.92] her children.
[959.42 → 961.02] This woman is grieved deeply
[961.02 → 962.26] and she's not afraid
[962.26 → 964.70] to speak that out loud.
[966.28 → 967.12] And you should know
[967.12 → 967.66] that for the rest
[967.66 → 968.40] of the book of Ruth,
[968.48 → 969.00] we're going to see
[969.00 → 969.58] how Naomi,
[969.84 → 970.04] you know,
[970.12 → 971.14] like all of us,
[971.48 → 973.00] she's stuck in her own life.
[973.08 → 973.54] She doesn't have
[973.54 → 974.48] some bigger picture view
[974.48 → 975.22] of what's going on.
[975.42 → 976.18] She doesn't have a book
[976.18 → 976.94] telling her where this
[976.94 → 978.02] is all going like we do.
[978.38 → 979.20] Naomi's just living
[979.20 → 980.48] in the pain of her grief
[980.48 → 982.08] and she's allowed to do that.
[982.56 → 983.80] And what she will see
[983.80 → 985.24] through very ordinary
[985.24 → 985.98] circumstances
[985.98 → 987.42] is that the God
[987.42 → 988.30] to whom she brings
[988.30 → 988.94] deep bitterness
[988.94 → 990.36] hears her.
[991.50 → 992.02] That the God
[992.02 → 992.44] that she has
[992.44 → 994.04] so many grievances with
[994.04 → 994.88] over the loss
[994.88 → 995.56] she's experienced
[995.56 → 996.46] is the God
[996.46 → 997.22] who's saying to her,
[997.38 → 998.10] I know what you're
[998.10 → 998.64] going through.
[999.82 → 1001.56] Watch me work
[1001.56 → 1002.90] in response
[1002.90 → 1004.16] to your cries.
[1006.28 → 1006.72] Now,
[1006.82 → 1007.52] in the book of Ruth,
[1007.58 → 1008.42] we're going to open up
[1008.42 → 1009.10] several themes.
[1009.20 → 1009.54] Like I said,
[1009.60 → 1010.34] this is a textured,
[1010.70 → 1011.92] deep theological book.
[1012.00 → 1013.02] It has the theme
[1013.02 → 1013.60] of kingship
[1013.60 → 1014.28] where God provides
[1014.28 → 1015.14] a king for his people.
[1015.58 → 1016.18] It has the theme
[1016.18 → 1016.68] of redemption
[1016.68 → 1017.60] where Boaz,
[1017.90 → 1018.50] this Israelite,
[1018.56 → 1019.42] becomes the kinsman
[1019.42 → 1020.60] redeemer who brings
[1020.60 → 1021.64] into his family
[1021.64 → 1022.60] Ruth and Naomi.
[1023.24 → 1024.10] There's the theme
[1024.10 → 1025.70] of Jesus' lineage
[1025.70 → 1026.58] now grafting
[1026.58 → 1027.40] this outsider,
[1027.58 → 1028.74] poor Mobile woman
[1028.74 → 1030.10] who she's named
[1030.10 → 1031.66] in Jesus' genealogy.
[1032.44 → 1033.14] But this morning
[1033.14 → 1034.12] what I want to focus on
[1034.12 → 1034.72] with the few minutes
[1034.72 → 1035.40] we have left
[1035.40 → 1037.36] is the way in which
[1037.36 → 1039.24] God is sovereignly
[1039.24 → 1041.52] guiding their lives.
[1042.12 → 1042.72] The way in which
[1042.72 → 1043.44] they're walking
[1043.44 → 1044.10] through a mess,
[1044.18 → 1044.64] they're walking
[1044.64 → 1045.14] through grief,
[1045.28 → 1046.56] and God is right there
[1046.56 → 1047.34] in it with them.
[1047.56 → 1048.34] They can't see it,
[1048.38 → 1049.36] but he's orchestrating
[1049.36 → 1050.40] and navigating
[1050.40 → 1051.50] and making things
[1051.50 → 1052.50] happen exactly
[1052.50 → 1054.14] as he sees fits,
[1055.04 → 1056.52] even in the midst
[1056.52 → 1057.42] of crisis and pain.
[1059.30 → 1060.32] I think it's easy
[1060.32 → 1061.26] to believe generally
[1061.26 → 1062.04] in the sovereignty
[1062.04 → 1062.62] of God,
[1062.88 → 1063.44] that he's guiding
[1063.44 → 1064.74] our lives in some sense
[1064.74 → 1066.18] when life is going well.
[1066.52 → 1066.70] Right?
[1066.74 → 1067.22] You can sort of
[1067.22 → 1067.92] look at your life,
[1068.00 → 1068.66] you look at your family,
[1068.66 → 1069.34] look at your health
[1069.34 → 1069.80] or your job
[1069.80 → 1070.46] or whatever it is,
[1070.70 → 1071.12] and you can say,
[1071.20 → 1072.32] wow, Lord, thank you.
[1072.64 → 1073.78] You're taking care of me.
[1074.02 → 1075.20] You're organizing life
[1075.20 → 1075.80] in a way that I'm
[1075.80 → 1076.82] flourishing and thriving.
[1077.16 → 1078.22] It is another thing
[1078.22 → 1079.04] all together
[1079.04 → 1080.64] to believe that God's
[1080.64 → 1082.08] guiding and blessing
[1082.08 → 1082.64] our life
[1082.64 → 1083.40] and he's in control
[1083.40 → 1084.30] of our circumstances
[1084.30 → 1085.50] when everything
[1085.50 → 1086.30] is going wrong.
[1087.72 → 1088.22] And some of you
[1088.22 → 1088.70] know exactly
[1088.70 → 1089.52] what I'm talking about.
[1090.20 → 1091.96] It is a very hard thing
[1091.96 → 1092.54] to say, wow,
[1092.62 → 1093.80] I believe in the sovereignty
[1093.80 → 1094.78] and the goodness of God
[1094.78 → 1095.98] and I have five months
[1095.98 → 1096.96] to live now that I've
[1096.96 → 1098.14] received a cancer diagnosis.
[1099.18 → 1100.02] It is a very different
[1100.02 → 1100.50] thing to say,
[1100.58 → 1102.12] God is good all the time
[1102.12 → 1103.08] when you've lost
[1103.08 → 1103.82] the person you've been
[1103.82 → 1105.38] married to for 50 plus years
[1105.38 → 1108.04] or when a child you love
[1108.04 → 1108.64] you have to be
[1108.64 → 1110.04] at the graveside for
[1110.04 → 1111.06] and you think,
[1111.12 → 1111.72] God, like,
[1112.32 → 1113.30] what are you doing here?
[1114.24 → 1115.12] And you are forced
[1115.12 → 1115.60] to ask,
[1115.66 → 1116.50] and many believers
[1116.50 → 1117.32] at some point
[1117.32 → 1117.66] in their life,
[1117.70 → 1118.36] if you haven't asked
[1118.36 → 1118.88] these questions,
[1119.00 → 1119.52] there will probably
[1119.52 → 1120.10] come a time
[1120.10 → 1120.60] where you do,
[1121.36 → 1122.16] where you're in grief
[1122.16 → 1122.72] and pain
[1122.72 → 1123.48] and you're hurting
[1123.48 → 1123.90] and you say,
[1123.94 → 1124.30] God, like,
[1124.34 → 1124.94] do you care?
[1125.82 → 1126.42] Is there something
[1126.42 → 1127.16] that we have done
[1127.16 → 1128.58] to earn an extra level
[1128.58 → 1129.70] of punishment from you?
[1129.80 → 1130.74] Do you not notice
[1130.74 → 1131.88] the pain we're going through?
[1132.26 → 1132.98] Is there a way
[1132.98 → 1133.70] in which you could just
[1133.70 → 1135.02] take this away?
[1135.88 → 1136.06] Like,
[1136.20 → 1137.76] if you care for us,
[1137.98 → 1138.88] why would you allow
[1138.88 → 1139.40] it to happen?
[1139.80 → 1140.80] And if you're sovereign,
[1141.16 → 1142.82] you certainly don't feel good
[1142.82 → 1143.92] to us right now.
[1143.92 → 1146.98] I have to say
[1146.98 → 1148.20] in my study this week,
[1149.08 → 1150.00] just reading
[1150.00 → 1151.26] and living into
[1151.26 → 1152.20] Naomi's bitterness,
[1152.40 → 1152.90] I have to say
[1152.90 → 1154.14] I came to appreciate her.
[1155.10 → 1155.66] And you should know
[1155.66 → 1156.40] that commentaries,
[1156.56 → 1157.32] different commentaries,
[1157.46 → 1158.36] they look at Naomi
[1158.36 → 1159.02] quite negatively,
[1159.16 → 1159.34] saying,
[1159.44 → 1160.56] this woman is very bitter.
[1161.00 → 1162.00] She is very harsh
[1162.00 → 1162.80] towards God.
[1163.06 → 1163.52] But you know what
[1163.52 → 1164.48] I appreciate about her?
[1165.56 → 1166.28] Is her honesty.
[1167.46 → 1168.16] Naomi does not
[1168.16 → 1168.96] hide her grief.
[1169.52 → 1170.10] She does not
[1170.10 → 1171.42] sugarcoat her bitterness.
[1171.88 → 1172.68] She does not say
[1172.68 → 1173.18] to her community,
[1173.26 → 1173.58] hey guys,
[1173.58 → 1174.40] everything's okay,
[1174.72 → 1175.42] and try to put on
[1175.42 → 1176.70] this false mask
[1176.70 → 1177.78] of everything being fine.
[1178.06 → 1178.92] She has the guts
[1178.92 → 1179.30] to say,
[1179.42 → 1180.20] I am hurting,
[1180.66 → 1181.52] I am grieving,
[1181.70 → 1182.18] and I'm willing
[1182.18 → 1183.20] to speak that right
[1183.20 → 1184.16] to God and say,
[1184.26 → 1185.16] it's His hand
[1185.16 → 1186.40] that's against me.
[1187.40 → 1187.92] And I believe
[1187.92 → 1188.70] that Naomi has
[1188.70 → 1189.34] this ability
[1189.34 → 1189.92] to sort of
[1189.92 → 1191.22] hold pain
[1191.22 → 1193.24] and almost wait
[1193.24 → 1193.84] for God
[1193.84 → 1194.62] to do something
[1194.62 → 1195.22] about it.
[1196.28 → 1197.24] She has the ability
[1197.24 → 1197.72] to sort of
[1197.72 → 1198.64] speak her hurt,
[1198.72 → 1199.40] her deepest pain,
[1199.64 → 1200.62] right to the Father
[1200.62 → 1201.58] and say,
[1201.68 → 1202.40] now it's your turn
[1202.40 → 1202.96] to act.
[1203.42 → 1203.88] You know
[1203.88 → 1204.54] how I feel.
[1205.10 → 1205.56] You know
[1205.56 → 1205.86] the hurt
[1205.86 → 1206.50] I'm experiencing.
[1206.80 → 1207.50] It's your turn
[1207.50 → 1208.18] to do something
[1208.18 → 1208.72] about it.
[1209.96 → 1210.86] And here's something
[1210.86 → 1212.50] that we can easily miss
[1212.50 → 1213.20] when we read
[1213.20 → 1214.16] through Ruth chapter 1.
[1215.52 → 1215.90] Naomi,
[1216.42 → 1217.72] not for a second,
[1218.48 → 1219.50] renounces her faith.
[1219.74 → 1220.38] Did you notice that?
[1221.28 → 1222.72] Not for a second
[1222.72 → 1224.04] did Naomi say,
[1224.38 → 1225.38] that's it.
[1225.96 → 1227.30] I'm done with Yahweh.
[1227.44 → 1228.20] I'm done with the God
[1228.20 → 1228.52] of Israel.
[1228.52 → 1228.98] I'm going to go
[1228.98 → 1229.82] worship Ko mesh,
[1229.84 → 1230.28] who's the God
[1230.28 → 1230.94] of the Mobiles.
[1231.24 → 1231.56] She's like,
[1231.64 → 1231.84] no.
[1232.64 → 1233.52] Never does she say,
[1233.58 → 1234.44] God, I'm done with you.
[1234.50 → 1235.22] I'm finished with you.
[1235.36 → 1236.44] She brings her grievance
[1236.44 → 1237.18] and she does it
[1237.18 → 1237.96] in the context
[1237.96 → 1238.86] of abiding,
[1239.08 → 1239.70] trusting faith.
[1240.38 → 1241.64] That is a profound
[1241.64 → 1243.90] thing to do.
[1244.62 → 1245.78] She holds her grief
[1245.78 → 1246.40] and her pain
[1246.40 → 1247.48] and she does not
[1247.48 → 1249.02] let it make her give up.
[1250.20 → 1250.70] And I think
[1250.70 → 1251.62] of the many things
[1251.62 → 1252.54] that Ruth chapter 1
[1252.54 → 1253.64] is opening us up to
[1253.64 → 1255.40] is those big questions
[1255.40 → 1255.88] of asking,
[1256.12 → 1256.86] do I believe God
[1256.86 → 1257.62] guides my life
[1257.62 → 1258.24] in crisis,
[1259.16 → 1259.80] in pain,
[1260.36 → 1261.54] and do I have
[1261.54 → 1262.02] the ability
[1262.02 → 1263.44] to hold my grief
[1263.44 → 1265.04] and bring it to Him,
[1265.90 → 1266.94] trusting that He can
[1266.94 → 1267.84] now do something
[1267.84 → 1268.52] about it?
[1269.50 → 1269.94] Because I think
[1269.94 → 1270.66] that's what Ruth 1
[1270.66 → 1271.14] is all about.
[1271.22 → 1271.98] It's about Naomi's
[1271.98 → 1273.18] deep bitterness and pain
[1273.18 → 1274.10] being brought
[1274.10 → 1275.38] and expressed to God
[1275.38 → 1276.22] and she's sort of
[1276.22 → 1277.24] holding and waiting
[1277.24 → 1277.88] for Him to now
[1277.88 → 1279.70] do something about it.
[1280.52 → 1281.50] And her act of faith
[1281.50 → 1282.54] is actually returning.
[1282.74 → 1283.12] You should know
[1283.12 → 1284.04] that a repeated word
[1284.04 → 1284.68] in Ruth 1
[1284.68 → 1286.10] is Naomi returning.
[1286.20 → 1287.22] Everything is returning
[1287.22 → 1287.72] because Naomi's
[1287.72 → 1288.52] going back home
[1288.52 → 1289.04] to the place
[1289.04 → 1289.78] where her God is.
[1290.02 → 1291.16] She's returning to God
[1291.16 → 1292.90] to see what He will do.
[1295.68 → 1296.74] Now, I want to admit
[1296.74 → 1297.56] to you a strange
[1297.56 → 1298.28] part of my week.
[1298.78 → 1300.14] I think about
[1300.14 → 1301.06] this big question
[1301.06 → 1302.64] of how we see
[1302.64 → 1303.48] God in crisis,
[1304.02 → 1304.82] how God shows up
[1304.82 → 1305.68] in His sovereign goodness
[1305.68 → 1306.26] in the middle
[1306.26 → 1307.38] of our own circumstances
[1307.38 → 1308.44] in our ordinary lives.
[1308.84 → 1309.76] And I'm trying to think,
[1309.90 → 1311.44] how do I illustrate this
[1311.44 → 1312.36] in our own day?
[1313.28 → 1313.88] And I couldn't think
[1313.88 → 1314.22] of anything.
[1314.22 → 1314.98] I have this every now
[1314.98 → 1315.56] and then on Fridays
[1315.56 → 1316.06] where I'm like,
[1316.30 → 1317.36] I'm really stuck, Lord.
[1317.64 → 1318.22] You've got to help me
[1318.22 → 1318.80] write this sermon.
[1318.92 → 1320.14] And that's a common experience.
[1320.54 → 1321.08] But this week,
[1321.30 → 1322.20] it just so happened
[1322.20 → 1324.10] at 10 a.m. on Friday,
[1324.44 → 1325.16] this woman comes
[1325.16 → 1325.68] to the church
[1325.68 → 1326.36] out of the blue,
[1326.46 → 1326.94] unannounced,
[1327.02 → 1327.54] did not tell me
[1327.54 → 1328.02] she was coming.
[1328.20 → 1328.98] I haven't seen her
[1328.98 → 1329.74] in a few years now.
[1330.86 → 1331.82] And she says to me,
[1331.92 → 1332.84] Dave, I want to meet with you
[1332.84 → 1333.64] and just share with you
[1333.64 → 1334.44] how life is going.
[1334.78 → 1335.52] I want to thank you
[1335.52 → 1336.26] for the part you played
[1336.26 → 1337.04] in my family's life
[1337.04 → 1338.36] because as you'll know
[1338.36 → 1338.68] in a minute,
[1339.00 → 1339.78] this is the story.
[1340.10 → 1340.88] And as she's sharing,
[1340.96 → 1341.40] I'm like, whoa,
[1341.48 → 1342.34] this is profound.
[1342.34 → 1343.06] And then I get back
[1343.06 → 1343.80] to my office
[1343.80 → 1344.74] and I'm like,
[1344.92 → 1345.98] I think I'm meant
[1345.98 → 1346.96] to share her story
[1346.96 → 1347.62] in my sermon.
[1347.76 → 1348.68] So I call her up
[1348.68 → 1349.40] and I said,
[1349.46 → 1350.24] is it okay if I share
[1350.24 → 1351.18] your story in my sermon?
[1351.28 → 1351.84] She says, yes,
[1351.88 → 1352.46] you can do that.
[1352.50 → 1353.40] So this is the story.
[1353.96 → 1354.42] Two and a half,
[1354.50 → 1355.06] three years ago,
[1355.66 → 1356.62] I'm on the phone with her.
[1356.78 → 1357.46] She calls me up
[1357.46 → 1358.04] and she just says,
[1358.08 → 1359.04] I need to share with you
[1359.04 → 1359.72] the heaviness
[1359.72 → 1360.58] of what's going on
[1360.58 → 1361.08] in our family.
[1362.18 → 1363.08] Two of her daughters-in-law
[1363.08 → 1364.04] were expecting babies.
[1364.42 → 1365.44] Both of them miscarried.
[1365.76 → 1366.80] They were traumatic experiences
[1366.80 → 1367.40] for the family.
[1368.18 → 1369.18] Around that same time,
[1369.28 → 1370.30] her son and daughter-in-law
[1370.30 → 1371.56] get in a life-threatening
[1371.56 → 1372.18] car accident.
[1372.60 → 1373.42] And they weren't even sure
[1373.42 → 1374.40] if they were going to make it.
[1374.92 → 1376.06] And then if that weren't enough,
[1376.28 → 1377.38] then she gets diagnosed
[1377.38 → 1377.98] with cancer.
[1378.84 → 1379.60] And so she's on the phone
[1379.60 → 1380.30] with me sharing
[1380.30 → 1381.12] all these crises
[1381.12 → 1381.78] and there are others
[1381.78 → 1382.70] I'm not going to share about.
[1383.26 → 1384.26] And she's just weeping
[1384.26 → 1385.88] and I remember just saying,
[1386.00 → 1386.84] what do I even say
[1386.84 → 1387.34] to this woman?
[1387.62 → 1388.52] Like, what's the word
[1388.52 → 1389.22] of a pastor here?
[1389.24 → 1390.10] And I just grieved with her
[1390.10 → 1390.82] and prayed with her.
[1391.18 → 1391.82] And one of the things
[1391.82 → 1392.78] she said through tears
[1392.78 → 1393.30] on the phone
[1393.30 → 1393.78] two and a half,
[1393.84 → 1394.68] three years ago was,
[1395.02 → 1396.80] I feel like Job.
[1397.90 → 1399.12] I feel like everything
[1399.12 → 1400.56] is being taken away from me.
[1400.96 → 1402.32] And I don't understand why.
[1403.34 → 1403.94] And again,
[1404.00 → 1404.72] there are no words
[1404.72 → 1405.84] for these conversations.
[1406.02 → 1406.66] And so we grieved
[1406.66 → 1407.20] and we prayed
[1407.20 → 1408.36] and I didn't talk to her
[1408.36 → 1408.74] for a while.
[1408.88 → 1409.00] You know,
[1409.04 → 1409.66] I knew her family
[1409.66 → 1410.30] and I was involved
[1410.30 → 1410.94] in the situation.
[1411.80 → 1413.04] She shows up at 10 a.m.
[1413.04 → 1413.92] on Friday morning
[1413.92 → 1414.38] and she says,
[1414.44 → 1414.66] Dave,
[1414.72 → 1415.48] I want you to know,
[1415.54 → 1415.94] number one,
[1416.00 → 1416.90] the cancer's in remission.
[1417.90 → 1419.02] My son and daughter-in-law
[1419.02 → 1419.60] have recovered
[1419.60 → 1420.62] from the injury
[1420.62 → 1421.68] they had in the car accident.
[1422.24 → 1423.36] A child has been born
[1423.36 → 1424.12] to one couple
[1424.12 → 1425.62] and another daughter-in-law
[1425.62 → 1426.18] is expecting.
[1427.28 → 1429.38] And we just marvelled together
[1429.38 → 1431.18] at the goodness of God.
[1431.76 → 1432.00] You know,
[1432.04 → 1432.78] two and a half years ago,
[1432.82 → 1433.50] there are no words.
[1433.62 → 1434.62] And then we just stood there
[1434.62 → 1435.20] and we hugged
[1435.20 → 1435.56] and we thought,
[1435.64 → 1435.84] man,
[1435.94 → 1437.26] God hears our cries.
[1437.80 → 1439.02] He hears our tears.
[1439.12 → 1440.10] He sees our pain
[1440.10 → 1441.52] and he shows up.
[1442.28 → 1442.60] And of course,
[1442.68 → 1443.18] we didn't know
[1443.18 → 1443.84] two and a half years ago
[1443.84 → 1444.62] where this was going.
[1444.70 → 1445.52] There's no road map.
[1445.62 → 1446.20] There's no, like,
[1446.56 → 1447.34] way of knowing
[1447.34 → 1448.18] and we just marvelled
[1448.18 → 1448.90] at the God
[1448.90 → 1449.90] who we worship
[1449.90 → 1451.64] sees us.
[1452.30 → 1453.52] He knows our pain
[1453.52 → 1455.30] and he's with us.
[1455.96 → 1457.02] Orchestrating his good
[1457.02 → 1458.22] and perfect plan
[1458.22 → 1459.68] for our lives.
[1461.08 → 1461.48] Now,
[1461.54 → 1462.12] let me say
[1462.12 → 1463.50] as straight up as I can,
[1463.66 → 1465.30] I know that not every story
[1465.30 → 1466.96] has a bow tie at the end.
[1467.74 → 1468.40] Not every story
[1468.40 → 1470.04] is happily ever after
[1470.04 → 1470.66] in our church,
[1470.66 → 1471.58] in our families,
[1471.72 → 1472.32] in our community.
[1472.84 → 1473.74] And I'm also aware
[1473.74 → 1474.50] that some of us
[1474.50 → 1475.32] get the luxury
[1475.32 → 1476.76] of years later
[1476.76 → 1477.80] we get the ability
[1477.80 → 1478.34] to see,
[1478.52 → 1478.78] oh,
[1478.92 → 1480.34] that's what God was doing
[1480.34 → 1481.00] in this divorce.
[1481.14 → 1482.10] That's what God was doing
[1482.10 → 1483.18] when I lost my job
[1483.18 → 1484.40] and got this terrible diagnosis
[1484.40 → 1485.78] and our family blew up.
[1485.96 → 1487.42] We sometimes get the ability
[1487.42 → 1487.84] to see,
[1488.00 → 1488.20] oh,
[1488.32 → 1489.44] that's where God was.
[1490.22 → 1490.98] But oftentimes,
[1492.04 → 1493.18] we limp along
[1493.18 → 1493.90] until we die
[1493.90 → 1494.50] and see Jesus.
[1495.64 → 1497.26] And we live with that sense
[1497.26 → 1498.36] that that day will come
[1498.36 → 1499.78] at the end of our lives
[1499.78 → 1500.78] when we're with Christ
[1500.78 → 1501.26] in glory.
[1501.46 → 1502.12] That's the time
[1502.12 → 1502.80] the clarity comes
[1502.80 → 1503.48] and we limp along
[1503.48 → 1504.00] until then.
[1504.14 → 1504.80] And that's a reality
[1504.80 → 1505.60] for many of us.
[1506.24 → 1507.78] But we marvel in Ruth
[1507.78 → 1509.80] at the reality
[1509.80 → 1510.72] of the God we worship
[1510.72 → 1512.56] because He is sovereign,
[1513.40 → 1514.92] He is faithful,
[1515.46 → 1518.80] and He does control history.
[1519.90 → 1521.44] He does not waste,
[1521.52 → 1522.06] maybe this is what
[1522.06 → 1522.48] some of you need
[1522.48 → 1522.94] to hear the most,
[1523.16 → 1524.16] He does not waste
[1524.16 → 1524.74] our suffering.
[1524.74 → 1527.12] I don't want to explain
[1527.12 → 1528.24] any suffering away.
[1528.42 → 1529.46] I don't want to presume
[1529.46 → 1530.78] to know why some families
[1530.78 → 1531.78] go through so much more
[1531.78 → 1532.50] hardship than others,
[1532.76 → 1533.50] why some people have
[1533.50 → 1534.46] every physical ailment
[1534.46 → 1535.74] and other people able-bodied,
[1536.04 → 1537.90] why some lives seem so simple
[1537.90 → 1539.84] and other lives seem so complex.
[1540.04 → 1541.50] But what I am convinced of
[1541.50 → 1543.10] in Ruth chapter 1
[1543.10 → 1545.20] is that God is always at work.
[1545.98 → 1547.02] He hears the cries
[1547.02 → 1547.64] of His people
[1547.64 → 1548.94] and He is the one
[1548.94 → 1550.08] who controls time,
[1550.26 → 1551.18] controls the nations,
[1551.50 → 1552.36] controls history,
[1552.66 → 1553.50] holds the world,
[1553.50 → 1554.68] and He's the one
[1554.68 → 1556.42] who Romans 8 says,
[1556.72 → 1557.76] for I am convinced
[1557.76 → 1558.64] that He's working
[1558.64 → 1560.52] all things together
[1560.52 → 1561.62] for the good of those
[1561.62 → 1562.18] who love Him,
[1562.44 → 1563.28] who have been called
[1563.28 → 1564.60] according to His plan.
[1566.36 → 1567.34] And maybe my word
[1567.34 → 1567.96] this morning,
[1569.28 → 1570.60] especially to those
[1570.60 → 1571.18] who are bitter,
[1572.02 → 1572.84] maybe you can just relate
[1572.84 → 1573.84] to Naomi in deep
[1573.84 → 1574.94] and unknown ways,
[1575.42 → 1576.62] the word for those of us
[1576.62 → 1577.88] who experience that grief
[1577.88 → 1580.74] is brought it to the Lord.
[1580.74 → 1584.46] hold that in faith
[1584.46 → 1586.96] and allow Him to act.
[1588.06 → 1589.34] There are so many ways
[1589.34 → 1590.04] that God is working
[1590.04 → 1591.04] that we never see.
[1591.38 → 1592.04] There are so many ways
[1592.04 → 1592.56] that He's working
[1592.56 → 1593.14] in our community
[1593.14 → 1594.18] that we don't get privy
[1594.18 → 1595.30] to understand,
[1595.42 → 1596.18] but we trust
[1596.18 → 1597.60] that He's sovereign,
[1598.08 → 1599.92] that He's faithful,
[1599.92 → 1601.74] and He is working
[1601.74 → 1603.88] out good purposes.
[1605.40 → 1606.48] That's the story
[1606.48 → 1607.06] of Ruth.
[1607.70 → 1608.66] That's the story
[1608.66 → 1609.46] of the church.
[1610.08 → 1611.34] That is our story.
[1611.90 → 1612.78] And we are invited
[1612.78 → 1614.98] to trust in a sovereign
[1614.98 → 1616.44] and faithful
[1616.44 → 1618.06] and good God.
[1619.56 → 1620.86] Let me lead us in prayer.
[1620.86 → 1630.86] Father,
[1631.56 → 1631.96] at this moment,
[1632.04 → 1633.06] I want to bring before you
[1633.06 → 1633.64] those of us
[1633.64 → 1634.92] who have heavy hearts,
[1635.52 → 1637.68] who can relate to Naomi
[1637.68 → 1638.84] and just have burdens
[1638.84 → 1639.56] and bitterness
[1639.56 → 1640.40] and pain
[1640.40 → 1641.34] and questions.
[1642.60 → 1644.02] I want to hold before you
[1644.02 → 1644.90] those in our church
[1644.90 → 1645.68] and our families
[1645.68 → 1646.96] who don't even know
[1646.96 → 1647.96] how to pray
[1647.96 → 1649.36] because the grief
[1649.36 → 1650.12] is too great.
[1650.86 → 1652.60] And my prayer
[1652.60 → 1654.38] is that You would meet us
[1654.38 → 1655.76] in our places of need,
[1656.74 → 1658.84] that You would hold us
[1658.84 → 1659.82] in our grief,
[1660.58 → 1662.22] and that You would reveal to us
[1662.22 → 1663.82] that You are for us.
[1664.90 → 1666.08] Lord, would You do
[1666.08 → 1667.30] what You need to do
[1667.30 → 1668.84] to give us strength?
[1669.52 → 1670.48] Would You uphold us
[1670.48 → 1670.98] in our places
[1670.98 → 1671.92] of greatest pain?
[1672.60 → 1673.10] And would You,
[1673.24 → 1674.04] by Your Spirit,
[1674.72 → 1675.80] give us hope,
[1676.68 → 1678.12] give us patience,
[1678.58 → 1680.20] and enable us to wait
[1680.20 → 1681.42] because we know
[1681.42 → 1682.62] a day is coming
[1682.62 → 1683.84] when our tears
[1683.84 → 1684.74] will be wiped away,
[1685.16 → 1686.68] our creation will be healed,
[1686.82 → 1689.26] and we will be made right.
[1689.92 → 1691.26] So we wait for You
[1691.26 → 1693.46] and we pray in Jesus' name.
[1694.16 → 1694.48] Amen.
[1694.48 → 1698.84] I invite you to stand
[1698.84 → 1700.52] and sing a song
[1700.52 → 1702.04] called The Goodness of God.
[1703.78 → 1704.60] I just want to say
[1704.60 → 1705.10] a couple words
[1705.10 → 1705.66] about this song.
[1705.74 → 1706.16] Number one,
[1706.24 → 1707.12] I've learned that this is
[1707.12 → 1707.84] a bit of a favourite
[1707.84 → 1708.38] in our church.
[1708.48 → 1709.16] Every time I'm sitting
[1709.16 → 1709.62] in the front,
[1709.88 → 1710.66] I feel carried
[1710.66 → 1711.48] by your worship.
[1712.26 → 1712.92] But number two,
[1713.00 → 1714.20] I'm aware that for some of us,
[1714.26 → 1715.44] this is not easy to sing.
[1716.20 → 1716.62] For some of us,
[1716.68 → 1717.88] you can belt these words out
[1717.88 → 1718.68] because you celebrate
[1718.68 → 1719.32] and you feel
[1719.32 → 1719.94] the goodness of God.
[1720.00 → 1720.50] For some of us,
[1720.50 → 1721.18] it might just be
[1721.18 → 1722.28] a defiant act
[1722.28 → 1723.18] to sing this
[1723.18 → 1723.92] because it betrays
[1723.92 → 1724.44] our emotions.
[1725.26 → 1726.42] And maybe you're in a place
[1726.42 → 1727.44] where you just can't sing
[1727.44 → 1728.90] this song because it's so hard
[1728.90 → 1729.72] and it's so deep.
[1730.14 → 1731.82] Let us sing it for you
[1731.82 → 1733.88] and let us sing it with you
[1733.88 → 1735.46] as your family of faith
[1735.46 → 1737.16] that trusts in the goodness of God.
[1737.24 → 1738.24] So let's worship together
[1738.24 → 1739.02] with this song.
