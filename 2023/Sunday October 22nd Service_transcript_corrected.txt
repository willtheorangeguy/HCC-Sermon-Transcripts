[0.00 → 0.58] Good morning.
[4.30 → 9.46] It's good to gather together again and gather around God's Word.
[11.70 → 18.18] We're going to continue our series called Homegrown,
[18.44 → 22.96] and it's this idea of what does it mean to follow Jesus,
[23.54 → 28.32] to be disciples, people who apply the gospel to every single part of their lives.
[28.32 → 33.34] We've been talking about marriage, parenting, hospitality, money,
[33.78 → 38.62] and today I'm going to talk about, in a sense, your time,
[39.90 → 42.64] but especially on Sabbath and rest.
[44.32 → 46.12] In the Ten Commandments, right, we read,
[46.26 → 48.54] Six days shall you labour, but the seventh is the Lord's.
[48.54 → 50.26] The seventh is a day of rest.
[50.32 → 52.08] Sabbath simply means rest.
[53.18 → 54.10] Sabbath rest.
[54.10 → 60.46] You know, it fascinates me that we needed a command to stop,
[61.84 → 63.04] a command to rest.
[63.30 → 64.88] You know, I kind of get the commands, you know,
[65.26 → 66.64] thou shalt not kill, of course not,
[66.96 → 69.62] a command to honour your parents, a command to not commit adultery,
[69.72 → 71.94] but a command to rest.
[72.02 → 73.20] I mean, you don't have to tell me twice.
[73.76 → 74.92] I'm all up for that nap.
[76.24 → 77.88] I'm willing to rest.
[78.90 → 81.48] And I think it's just, so what does it look like?
[81.48 → 83.30] What do we, what's going on here?
[83.74 → 85.22] And so we're going to talk about that this morning.
[85.36 → 87.18] What does rest look like?
[87.92 → 90.42] And then what does Sabbath rest look like?
[91.04 → 92.86] We're going to look at a passage about Jesus
[92.86 → 95.98] and the life of Jesus in Luke 6, the verses 1 through 11.
[96.44 → 97.40] So look at it with me.
[99.70 → 100.90] One Sabbath.
[101.18 → 102.70] So we'll start right off, all right?
[102.82 → 103.48] On a Sabbath.
[103.64 → 106.86] One Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grain fields
[106.86 → 110.10] and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain,
[111.16 → 113.58] rub them in their hands, and eat the kernels.
[114.58 → 115.76] Some of the Pharisees asked,
[116.24 → 119.98] why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?
[121.44 → 122.50] And Jesus answered them,
[122.58 → 124.58] have you never read?
[124.96 → 127.54] Bit of an insult here to a bunch of Bible guys.
[128.06 → 130.22] Have you never read what David did
[130.22 → 132.26] when he and his companions were hungry?
[132.42 → 134.92] He answered the house of God, like temple, tabernacle,
[134.92 → 137.78] and taking the consecrated, the holy bread,
[137.78 → 140.62] he ate what is lawful only for the priest to eat.
[140.92 → 142.84] And he also gave some to his companions.
[143.76 → 144.96] And then Jesus said to them,
[145.28 → 148.66] the Son of Man is the Lord of the Sabbath.
[149.40 → 150.68] Imagine how they hear that.
[152.12 → 154.68] On another Sabbath, he went into the synagogue
[154.68 → 156.38] and was teaching.
[156.64 → 159.64] And a man was there whose right hand was shrivelled.
[160.56 → 162.16] The Pharisees and the teachers of the law
[162.16 → 164.00] were looking for reasons to accuse Jesus.
[164.00 → 165.60] So they watched him closely
[165.60 → 169.24] to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.
[170.04 → 172.02] The law that they had was,
[172.46 → 174.42] if somebody was dying, you could do something about it.
[174.80 → 177.66] But if somebody's just merely sick or suffering in some way,
[178.08 → 179.48] not on the Sabbath.
[179.60 → 180.46] That was kind of the rule.
[181.22 → 183.00] But Jesus knew what they were thinking.
[183.14 → 184.72] He said to the man with the shrivelled hand,
[184.82 → 186.68] hey, get up, stand up in front of everyone.
[186.96 → 188.28] So he got up and he stood there.
[188.28 → 190.74] Then Jesus said to them,
[191.22 → 194.04] I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath?
[194.30 → 195.66] To do good or to do evil?
[196.66 → 198.82] To save life or to destroy it?
[199.42 → 201.24] And he looked around at them,
[201.66 → 202.50] at them all,
[202.62 → 203.58] and then he said to the man,
[203.72 → 204.72] stretch out your hand.
[204.76 → 205.42] And he did so,
[205.48 → 206.92] and his hand was completely restored.
[207.52 → 209.44] But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law
[209.44 → 210.32] were furious
[210.32 → 212.54] and began to discuss with one another
[212.54 → 214.68] what they might do to Jesus.
[217.02 → 219.74] So just picture all that, right?
[219.82 → 221.52] Jesus walking through the grain fields.
[222.14 → 222.86] The guys are hungry.
[223.80 → 224.72] They grab some grain.
[224.86 → 227.30] They roll it and get the kernels out
[227.30 → 228.54] and have a bit of a snack.
[230.54 → 236.50] It was breaking one of the 39 works forbidden on Sabbath.
[236.50 → 242.54] These were rules that were made by religious leaders
[242.54 → 244.44] to try to keep people,
[245.26 → 246.40] the Sabbath pure
[246.40 → 247.78] and keep people on the right track.
[248.36 → 250.00] We probably, most of us probably say,
[250.10 → 252.38] well, that was incredibly legalistic.
[253.50 → 254.16] And I get that.
[254.20 → 255.04] I kind of agree in a way.
[255.58 → 256.28] But in a way,
[256.36 → 259.46] we're kind of self-righteous about it all too.
[259.84 → 261.86] Notice Jesus doesn't say,
[262.30 → 264.54] I've come to get rid of the Sabbath.
[264.54 → 267.36] It made me think of how I grew up.
[267.40 → 268.64] I grew up in the church
[268.64 → 270.44] and my parents,
[270.58 → 270.78] you know,
[270.82 → 272.18] they had Sabbath rituals.
[273.30 → 273.92] If Dad,
[274.10 → 275.04] if we needed gas,
[275.18 → 276.12] the tank was getting low,
[276.18 → 278.08] Dad would make sure he tanked up on Saturday night.
[278.92 → 279.08] Right?
[279.18 → 281.34] They were not going to go to the gas station on a Sunday.
[281.76 → 282.96] Mom would peel the potatoes
[282.96 → 285.22] for Sunday dinner on Saturday.
[285.86 → 286.08] Right?
[286.18 → 287.44] These practices.
[288.02 → 288.20] You know,
[288.22 → 291.04] we never would have gone to a restaurant
[291.04 → 292.86] because, you know,
[292.90 → 295.48] you don't make other people work on the Sabbath.
[295.62 → 295.70] Right?
[295.86 → 296.94] All these things.
[297.04 → 299.10] Some of you maybe grew up the same way.
[299.58 → 299.96] I remember,
[300.16 → 301.54] you know,
[301.56 → 302.86] I played ball hockey
[302.86 → 307.60] and my parents were a little bit more relaxed in some ways
[307.60 → 310.60] and so could play ball hockey on Sunday.
[310.72 → 312.46] That was fine to go to the local lacrosse box
[312.46 → 313.72] and a bunch of neighbourhood kids
[313.72 → 314.56] and we'd play ball hockey.
[315.24 → 316.14] But Dad said,
[316.20 → 316.32] you know,
[316.38 → 316.70] church,
[317.20 → 318.20] I grew up in Ladder.
[318.72 → 321.32] Church was at 2 in the afternoon
[321.32 → 323.00] and so Dad said,
[323.08 → 323.16] okay,
[323.24 → 325.24] you've got to come home
[325.24 → 326.84] prior to 2 o'clock
[326.84 → 328.92] so that the people going to the second service
[328.92 → 330.42] don't see you playing hockey
[330.42 → 333.08] and then you can go back later.
[334.04 → 334.06] So,
[334.54 → 336.52] anyway,
[336.68 → 336.80] you know,
[336.86 → 337.34] so yeah,
[337.58 → 338.34] legalistic,
[338.48 → 338.70] yeah,
[339.00 → 341.20] but I do have some sense,
[341.44 → 342.36] maybe as I get older,
[342.36 → 345.36] of an appreciation for a desire
[345.36 → 347.00] to keep Sabbath
[347.00 → 350.16] as opposed to turn it into a free-for-all.
[350.70 → 352.02] You can do whatever you want,
[352.06 → 352.78] it doesn't matter.
[353.08 → 354.96] You don't even have to put any thought into it,
[355.00 → 355.14] right?
[355.38 → 355.58] So,
[355.78 → 357.30] there's something about this
[357.30 → 358.08] and Jesus says,
[358.24 → 360.12] I'm Lord of the Sabbath.
[361.46 → 361.64] Right?
[361.70 → 362.70] Tells that story about David,
[362.78 → 362.90] right?
[362.96 → 363.10] You know,
[363.14 → 363.32] okay,
[363.42 → 364.74] David messed with it here.
[365.14 → 365.36] You know,
[365.44 → 366.06] and so he's saying,
[366.14 → 366.24] you know,
[366.42 → 366.72] yes,
[366.96 → 368.74] we don't have to be rigid
[368.74 → 371.18] but we do need to have a desire
[371.18 → 372.78] to be Sabbath people.
[374.30 → 375.48] What does that look like?
[376.36 → 376.90] Jesus said,
[377.14 → 378.90] I'm all about the Sabbath.
[379.26 → 380.86] I'm not trying to dismiss that.
[383.80 → 385.40] And then we think of our culture.
[386.86 → 387.06] Right?
[387.08 → 388.32] We don't know how to stop,
[389.18 → 390.04] how to rest.
[390.72 → 391.70] Nothing closes.
[392.50 → 393.50] 24 hours a day,
[393.60 → 394.30] always something.
[394.74 → 394.92] Right?
[394.96 → 396.90] And we have that dynamics going on too.
[396.90 → 398.10] We don't know how to stop.
[398.60 → 399.06] So,
[399.18 → 399.64] in a way,
[399.70 → 400.06] I would say,
[400.16 → 402.38] we have no business judging any attempts
[402.38 → 405.70] to encourage attempts to keep Sabbath.
[407.34 → 407.56] Right?
[407.64 → 409.16] We should be careful with that.
[410.22 → 411.86] I was listening to Tim Keller
[411.86 → 413.84] and he spoke of an article
[413.84 → 416.70] by a Jewish writer for the New York Times
[416.70 → 418.84] named Judas Gurevich.
[419.50 → 420.36] She wrote an article,
[420.54 → 421.88] Bring Back the Sabbath.
[422.58 → 424.34] She was raised Jewish and religious.
[424.74 → 425.96] She walked away from their faith
[425.96 → 427.90] and then later on in her life,
[427.98 → 428.66] she writes this.
[428.72 → 429.86] I'm going to read some of it to you.
[430.80 → 431.32] She says,
[431.42 → 434.04] My mood would darken every weekend.
[435.64 → 438.10] I began to drop in on the synagogue.
[439.40 → 439.78] Finally,
[439.94 → 442.08] I developed a theory for my condition.
[443.14 → 443.70] Formerly,
[443.88 → 445.84] some suffered from the Sabbath
[445.84 → 447.32] with all its rules,
[448.10 → 449.56] while I now suffered
[449.56 → 451.44] from the lack of Sabbath.
[451.44 → 454.02] There is ample evidence
[454.02 → 455.72] that our relationship to work
[455.72 → 456.68] is out of whack.
[457.82 → 459.60] Let me argue
[459.60 → 461.12] for the process
[461.12 → 463.08] that has helped keep workaholism
[463.08 → 463.88] in check
[463.88 → 465.78] for thousands of years.
[466.64 → 468.54] Most people believe
[468.54 → 469.64] to stop working
[469.64 → 470.68] merely means
[470.68 → 472.14] to stop working.
[472.88 → 474.56] But the inventors of the Sabbath
[474.56 → 476.52] knew it was much more complicated.
[476.52 → 478.88] You cannot downshift
[478.88 → 482.56] and casually and easily.
[482.90 → 484.06] This is why the Puritan
[484.06 → 485.48] and Jewish Sabbath
[485.48 → 487.64] were so exactingly intentional.
[488.64 → 489.88] The rules did not exist
[489.88 → 491.08] to torture the faithful.
[492.06 → 494.28] Interrupting the ceaseless striving
[494.28 → 497.92] required a surprisingly strenuous act
[497.92 → 498.56] of will,
[499.04 → 500.98] one bolstered by habit
[500.98 → 502.96] and social sanction.
[502.96 → 507.40] That kind of got me thinking.
[508.14 → 508.32] Right?
[509.08 → 509.84] You know, you think,
[509.92 → 511.12] okay, you're going to stop working,
[511.18 → 511.74] just stop working.
[511.84 → 514.66] But it goes much, much deeper than that.
[515.38 → 517.52] It's incredibly naive to think
[517.52 → 518.62] you'll just stop
[518.62 → 520.00] when you need to stop
[520.00 → 521.82] and you'll just give up your control
[521.82 → 523.88] when you need to give up your control.
[524.24 → 525.66] The ability to rest
[525.66 → 528.32] really is a matter of life and death
[528.32 → 529.00] and lifestyle.
[529.42 → 531.04] But it is not natural
[531.04 → 532.98] for sinful, self-centred man.
[533.20 → 535.22] And it is not simple.
[537.42 → 538.58] It takes discipline
[538.58 → 540.60] and it takes practice.
[542.10 → 542.54] Why?
[544.58 → 545.48] Some of it's about,
[546.26 → 547.10] think of the job,
[547.20 → 548.40] your job or the economy.
[548.62 → 550.60] We all feel somewhat insecure, right?
[550.78 → 552.56] Is it ever going to be enough?
[553.50 → 554.72] We could lose the job.
[554.82 → 555.26] We could lose,
[555.38 → 556.34] the economy could collapse.
[556.52 → 557.06] And we worry.
[557.20 → 558.48] And so we go after things.
[558.58 → 559.42] We go after more.
[559.42 → 561.48] Or else it's job expectations.
[561.96 → 563.08] You're always on,
[563.52 → 565.06] always connected.
[566.44 → 567.78] Even when you're not working,
[567.86 → 568.34] you're working.
[569.42 → 571.06] Never really stopping.
[572.58 → 574.24] Some sociologists say
[574.24 → 575.86] we used to get meaning
[575.86 → 577.68] in life from family.
[577.86 → 578.84] Many of us still do.
[579.40 → 580.50] So work with a way
[580.50 → 581.30] to bless your family.
[581.30 → 582.64] But now,
[582.80 → 583.16] often,
[583.40 → 584.98] you define yourself with it.
[585.18 → 587.58] You decide what you want to be
[587.58 → 590.64] and then you have significance.
[591.46 → 594.08] Which makes our expectations of work
[594.08 → 595.68] enormous.
[597.68 → 598.16] Enormous.
[599.76 → 602.14] So we are desperately in need of rest
[602.14 → 603.28] while at the same time
[603.28 → 605.20] unable to rest within ourselves.
[606.72 → 608.10] There's something deeper going on there.
[608.10 → 609.94] Tim Keller said,
[610.02 → 611.02] to practice Sabbath
[611.02 → 613.58] is a disciplined and faithful way
[613.58 → 614.12] to remember
[614.12 → 615.60] you are not the one
[615.60 → 617.00] who keeps the world running.
[619.16 → 619.50] And I think,
[619.64 → 620.02] and you say,
[620.08 → 620.82] well, of course.
[621.36 → 623.00] But I think there are ways we live
[623.00 → 624.04] where we act like
[624.04 → 626.26] we are God in some ways.
[626.60 → 628.16] And the ancient practice of Sabbath
[628.16 → 629.78] is about learning to rest.
[630.04 → 631.78] It's about learning to surrender,
[632.12 → 633.92] to reevaluate your identity,
[634.20 → 635.58] to celebrate relationships,
[635.58 → 636.92] to refocus.
[637.28 → 640.04] We need regular time for that.
[640.98 → 643.20] It doesn't just happen.
[644.76 → 645.74] I often feel like people
[645.74 → 647.10] just go with the flow.
[647.36 → 648.04] They just keep going.
[648.12 → 648.88] They just keep flowing
[648.88 → 649.52] and flowing and flowing.
[649.76 → 650.42] No one stops.
[650.52 → 651.10] No one reflects.
[651.18 → 651.74] No one rests.
[652.50 → 653.40] I think that's what Sabbath
[653.40 → 654.24] is trying to get us to do.
[654.46 → 656.48] To get the eyes off of yourself
[656.48 → 657.64] and onto God
[657.64 → 658.48] and onto others.
[659.80 → 661.84] God knew we needed this
[661.84 → 663.52] and He knew our tendency
[663.52 → 664.72] to not do that.
[664.98 → 666.24] So He made it a command.
[668.74 → 671.36] Back to Judas Slavic.
[671.60 → 672.34] She writes,
[672.66 → 674.42] When the Sabbath was still sacred,
[675.24 → 676.56] not only did drudgery
[676.56 → 677.82] give way to festivity
[677.82 → 679.90] and family gatherings
[679.90 → 680.64] and worship,
[681.30 → 682.36] but the machinery
[682.36 → 684.00] of self-censorship
[684.00 → 685.28] shut down too,
[685.70 → 686.10] stealing,
[686.24 → 687.00] and I like this line,
[687.38 → 688.82] the eternal murmur
[688.82 → 690.24] of self-reproach.
[690.24 → 695.08] You stopped enough
[695.08 → 697.68] to start figuring out
[697.68 → 699.50] the voices that were going on
[699.50 → 700.20] in your mind.
[700.74 → 702.22] You stopped enough
[702.22 → 703.42] to refocus.
[705.32 → 705.46] You know,
[705.50 → 706.56] Sabbath is about rest
[706.56 → 707.62] and when we think of rest,
[707.72 → 709.06] I need enough sleep
[709.06 → 709.64] and that's true.
[710.00 → 711.26] We need good sleep too.
[711.52 → 712.26] REM sleep,
[712.38 → 712.82] deep sleep,
[712.90 → 713.12] yes.
[713.52 → 714.04] So, yes,
[714.12 → 715.16] we need to rest
[715.16 → 716.52] from the physical exertions
[716.52 → 717.04] of life.
[717.04 → 719.40] But there's a deeper problem here
[719.40 → 720.08] and a deeper thing
[720.08 → 720.58] going on here.
[720.92 → 721.94] There's a work
[721.94 → 723.32] underneath the work
[723.32 → 724.26] that the writer calls
[724.26 → 727.04] the eternal inner murmur.
[727.90 → 729.92] The need to prove yourself.
[730.42 → 732.98] And that is incredibly tiring.
[733.98 → 735.04] And that work
[735.04 → 736.68] is never enough.
[738.44 → 739.58] It's never enough.
[740.94 → 742.44] I think of as a pastor,
[742.88 → 744.16] I've often fought
[744.16 → 745.06] over the years
[745.06 → 748.48] against my desire
[748.48 → 749.16] to please people.
[752.18 → 753.80] Trying to keep everyone
[753.80 → 755.20] happy and satisfied
[755.20 → 757.96] is never enough.
[760.02 → 760.68] It just isn't.
[762.78 → 764.16] It's hard to rest from that.
[766.08 → 768.34] That's where we need rest
[768.34 → 769.12] for our souls
[769.12 → 770.46] and a vacation then
[770.46 → 771.34] doesn't cut it.
[771.62 → 772.52] It's a deeper need,
[772.94 → 774.00] a soul rest
[774.00 → 775.14] which goes beyond
[775.14 → 776.38] mere physical rest.
[776.84 → 777.46] Sabbath rest,
[777.56 → 778.34] we need it.
[779.44 → 779.98] That's why Jesus
[779.98 → 780.76] calls himself
[780.76 → 781.68] the Lord of the Sabbath.
[782.02 → 783.10] I am the Lord
[783.10 → 784.80] of what it means
[784.80 → 785.98] to rest.
[789.64 → 791.14] He says it in Matthew 11.
[791.30 → 792.00] Look at it with me.
[793.50 → 794.56] Come to me,
[794.56 → 795.80] all you who are
[795.80 → 796.78] weary
[796.78 → 798.24] and burdened
[798.24 → 800.18] and I
[800.18 → 801.44] will give you rest.
[801.44 → 803.92] take my yoke.
[803.92 → 804.62] That sounds like
[804.62 → 805.16] a burden again
[805.16 → 805.66] but it's not.
[806.10 → 807.20] Take my yoke upon you
[807.20 → 808.32] and learn from me
[808.32 → 809.30] for I am gentle
[809.30 → 810.10] and humble in heart
[810.10 → 811.22] and you will find rest
[811.22 → 811.60] for what?
[811.78 → 812.98] For your souls.
[813.90 → 814.62] For my yoke
[814.62 → 815.34] is easy
[815.34 → 816.34] and my burden
[816.34 → 817.80] is light.
[819.74 → 820.48] In me,
[820.74 → 821.38] Jesus says,
[821.58 → 822.42] is the deep rest
[822.42 → 823.24] you desperately need.
[823.52 → 824.28] I am the Lord
[824.28 → 824.82] of rest.
[825.06 → 826.02] So if you want
[826.02 → 826.74] deep rest,
[826.90 → 828.04] you have to go to Jesus.
[828.04 → 829.14] And if you're still
[829.14 → 830.54] restless
[830.54 → 832.22] in those moments,
[832.46 → 833.34] then you need to learn
[833.34 → 834.02] what surrender
[834.02 → 834.70] is all about.
[835.00 → 836.04] How do you surrender
[836.04 → 836.56] to rest?
[836.74 → 837.54] It's sometimes like
[837.54 → 838.48] trying to get kids
[838.48 → 839.08] to go to bed.
[839.28 → 840.66] They desperately need rest
[840.66 → 842.42] but they fight against it.
[842.70 → 844.20] We sometimes do the same.
[846.16 → 846.58] And then I think
[846.58 → 847.66] of Genesis 2.
[847.78 → 848.28] Look at it with me.
[848.32 → 848.74] Genesis 2,
[848.78 → 849.44] verse 2 and 3.
[849.94 → 850.80] The seventh day,
[851.36 → 852.08] God has finished
[852.08 → 853.16] the work of creation,
[853.24 → 853.48] right,
[853.58 → 854.56] that he had been doing
[854.56 → 855.62] and on the seventh day
[855.62 → 856.84] he rested from all his work.
[856.84 → 857.98] Then God blessed
[857.98 → 858.92] that seventh day,
[859.02 → 859.86] made it holy
[859.86 → 860.82] because on it
[860.82 → 862.00] he rested from all the work
[862.00 → 863.04] of creating
[863.04 → 864.54] that he had done.
[865.84 → 866.96] God rested.
[867.46 → 868.60] Not because he was tired,
[869.12 → 869.64] obviously,
[870.06 → 871.32] but he makes things.
[871.68 → 872.32] He didn't make things.
[872.42 → 873.54] I'll create the animals
[873.54 → 874.38] and create the trees
[874.38 → 875.28] and create all things.
[875.68 → 876.22] And then he says,
[876.40 → 876.96] oh, that's good.
[877.02 → 877.44] Oh, man,
[877.46 → 878.52] that is so good too.
[878.80 → 879.76] Oh, that is good.
[880.02 → 880.82] And then he creates people
[880.82 → 881.00] and says,
[881.02 → 881.44] oh, man,
[881.62 → 882.52] that's very,
[882.78 → 883.86] very good.
[884.26 → 885.46] And rest then
[885.46 → 887.04] is about enjoying
[887.04 → 889.10] what has been done.
[892.46 → 893.24] How many of us
[893.24 → 894.64] run from thing to thing
[894.64 → 895.38] to thing
[895.38 → 896.06] to thing
[896.06 → 896.50] to thing
[896.50 → 898.32] never stopping for a moment
[898.32 → 898.50] and say,
[898.60 → 898.80] wow,
[898.94 → 900.76] this is really kind of cool.
[900.94 → 902.04] I really enjoyed this.
[902.30 → 902.80] This is a
[902.94 → 904.12] I made something good here.
[904.40 → 905.86] I think a place
[905.86 → 907.22] where I do it rather well
[907.22 → 909.02] is if I mow the lawn.
[910.86 → 911.30] Randy,
[911.60 → 912.94] it's so simple, right?
[913.60 → 914.24] Oh, here we go.
[914.24 → 914.88] There we go.
[915.48 → 915.62] Right?
[915.94 → 916.76] But, you know,
[916.82 → 916.98] then,
[917.08 → 919.08] especially when it's not
[919.08 → 919.90] yellow and dead,
[920.56 → 923.48] when it's nice lush
[923.48 → 924.04] and green
[924.04 → 924.82] and then you cut it
[924.82 → 925.56] and then you look back
[925.56 → 926.48] and it's,
[926.60 → 926.80] ah,
[926.92 → 928.00] the edges are done
[928.00 → 929.30] and it looks so good
[929.30 → 930.70] and you stand back
[930.70 → 930.92] and say,
[931.66 → 932.56] that's good.
[933.54 → 934.16] For now.
[935.14 → 935.88] But you could say,
[935.94 → 936.36] oh, man,
[936.38 → 937.26] then it's going to grow again
[937.26 → 938.16] and then I've got to cut it again.
[938.54 → 939.82] I'm concrete on everything.
[940.24 → 940.42] Right?
[940.42 → 942.42] And, you know,
[942.46 → 942.80] it's just,
[943.40 → 943.94] I think, you know,
[944.02 → 947.00] God was utterly satisfied
[947.00 → 948.76] with His creation
[948.76 → 950.16] and then celebrated it.
[951.20 → 952.16] So Sabbath is about
[952.16 → 953.48] celebrating what's good
[953.48 → 954.60] and enjoying it.
[956.34 → 957.60] Then we look at Hebrews 4,
[957.70 → 958.28] 9 and 11.
[958.28 → 961.00] There remains then
[961.00 → 962.20] a Sabbath rest
[962.20 → 963.98] for the people of God.
[965.66 → 967.24] For anyone who enters
[967.24 → 968.36] God's rest
[968.36 → 970.58] also rests from their work
[970.58 → 972.30] just as God did from His.
[972.80 → 973.40] Let us, therefore,
[973.50 → 974.52] make every effort
[974.52 → 975.56] to enter that rest.
[976.04 → 977.26] And there's that sense
[977.26 → 980.24] that we are like God
[980.24 → 980.76] in that sense.
[981.08 → 981.66] Through Christ,
[981.86 → 983.10] you can look at your life,
[983.20 → 984.08] you can look at yourself
[984.08 → 985.20] and others and your work
[985.20 → 985.88] and you say,
[986.20 → 987.78] wow, that's perfect.
[988.28 → 990.88] And Sabbath then
[990.88 → 991.42] is the time
[991.42 → 992.96] then to be also reminded
[992.96 → 993.94] who we are.
[994.48 → 995.14] God rests.
[995.36 → 996.14] We rest.
[996.56 → 997.86] We reflect His image,
[997.96 → 998.76] His divine image.
[999.28 → 1000.78] And we are then reminded
[1000.78 → 1001.48] that we are more
[1001.48 → 1002.96] than just our work.
[1003.48 → 1005.10] We partake in the Creator's
[1005.10 → 1005.86] grand design
[1005.86 → 1006.80] and story of life.
[1007.20 → 1008.28] We are image bearers
[1008.28 → 1009.28] and out of that
[1009.28 → 1010.98] we do what we do.
[1013.66 → 1015.18] We muddy that water up
[1015.18 → 1015.68] pretty good.
[1015.68 → 1019.06] We don't do
[1019.06 → 1020.28] to score points
[1020.28 → 1021.10] with God.
[1021.48 → 1021.88] We do,
[1022.22 → 1023.10] we work to
[1023.10 → 1024.30] work,
[1024.44 → 1024.98] get in on
[1024.98 → 1026.40] what God is already up to.
[1028.60 → 1029.24] Because, you know,
[1029.30 → 1029.80] if you're trying
[1029.80 → 1030.84] to prove yourself to God,
[1030.90 → 1032.02] that work is never done.
[1033.06 → 1033.80] That's never enough.
[1034.92 → 1035.98] Rest says it's good
[1035.98 → 1036.96] and I'm satisfied
[1036.96 → 1037.90] and I celebrate it.
[1038.36 → 1039.68] Rest says it's finished
[1040.20 → 1041.16] in Jesus.
[1041.16 → 1042.84] That's why I wanted
[1042.84 → 1043.54] to do some of Jesus'
[1043.64 → 1044.78] last words on the cross
[1044.78 → 1046.14] where it is finished
[1046.14 → 1048.38] and then His head hung down
[1048.38 → 1049.30] and He gave up His spirit.
[1049.54 → 1050.08] It's finished.
[1050.42 → 1051.56] Only through Jesus
[1051.56 → 1053.24] is it finished.
[1055.94 → 1056.88] Only through Him.
[1057.70 → 1058.48] It's interesting to me
[1058.48 → 1059.62] that Jesus called Himself
[1059.62 → 1060.42] Lord of the Sabbath
[1060.42 → 1061.16] and then the leaders
[1061.16 → 1061.88] were all mad
[1061.88 → 1062.58] and they were furious
[1062.58 → 1063.98] and they planned to kill Him
[1063.98 → 1064.94] and eventually they did.
[1065.28 → 1066.28] The irony was
[1066.28 → 1067.72] that through that death,
[1067.84 → 1068.58] Jesus then became
[1068.58 → 1069.38] Lord of all things,
[1069.38 → 1071.22] including Lord of the Sabbath.
[1072.18 → 1072.78] That's why I read it
[1072.78 → 1074.12] in 2 Corinthians 5.
[1074.18 → 1074.78] Look at it with me.
[1075.10 → 1075.64] Verse 21.
[1076.14 → 1077.04] God made Him,
[1077.16 → 1078.16] Jesus who had no sin,
[1078.22 → 1079.02] to be sin for us
[1079.02 → 1080.12] so that in Him
[1080.12 → 1081.00] we might become
[1081.00 → 1082.56] the righteousness of God.
[1082.74 → 1084.36] Not through your efforts,
[1084.48 → 1085.10] through Jesus.
[1085.32 → 1086.44] It is finished
[1086.44 → 1087.38] through Him.
[1088.96 → 1091.24] We rest in that gospel truth.
[1093.08 → 1094.44] Rest was missing
[1094.44 → 1095.98] until Jesus came
[1095.98 → 1097.28] and finished it all.
[1098.20 → 1099.02] There was no more need
[1099.02 → 1100.56] for that inner murmur
[1100.56 → 1101.52] of self-reproach.
[1101.82 → 1102.62] He lived the life
[1102.62 → 1103.28] we should have lived
[1103.28 → 1104.12] and He died the death
[1104.12 → 1106.10] we should have died.
[1106.40 → 1107.68] So when we follow Jesus,
[1108.04 → 1108.44] well then we,
[1108.94 → 1109.50] even though we try
[1109.50 → 1110.22] to be Christ-like,
[1110.38 → 1111.48] we're not doing it
[1111.48 → 1112.30] to score points.
[1112.54 → 1113.12] We're doing it
[1113.12 → 1114.10] because we recognize
[1114.10 → 1115.06] the finished work
[1115.06 → 1116.04] is in Him
[1116.04 → 1118.08] and He's at work in us.
[1122.40 → 1123.20] Through Jesus then,
[1123.28 → 1124.00] God looks at you
[1124.00 → 1124.32] and He says,
[1124.42 → 1125.82] ah, you're good.
[1125.92 → 1126.82] You're so very,
[1127.02 → 1127.80] very, very good.
[1127.80 → 1131.28] And I can rest in that.
[1132.72 → 1133.28] How many of you
[1133.28 → 1133.80] have seen the movie
[1133.80 → 1134.74] Chariots of Fire?
[1137.90 → 1138.18] Yeah.
[1139.40 → 1140.18] Nobody younger.
[1140.72 → 1141.12] But anyway.
[1143.68 → 1144.74] Story of two runners,
[1145.48 → 1147.06] kind of Olympic
[1147.06 → 1147.70] kind of runners.
[1148.68 → 1149.34] One of them
[1149.34 → 1150.56] can't stop working
[1150.56 → 1151.68] and he was asked
[1151.68 → 1152.48] in the movie,
[1152.78 → 1153.80] why are you working
[1153.80 → 1154.24] so hard?
[1154.28 → 1155.00] What are you doing here?
[1155.00 → 1155.92] And he said,
[1155.98 → 1156.64] he was a sprinter,
[1156.92 → 1157.18] he said,
[1157.26 → 1158.24] I have 10 seconds
[1158.24 → 1159.62] to justify my existence.
[1161.64 → 1161.78] Hmm.
[1162.70 → 1163.54] Imagine living that.
[1163.62 → 1164.54] I have 10 seconds
[1164.54 → 1165.86] to justify my existence.
[1166.82 → 1167.64] Another one
[1167.64 → 1168.92] was a Christian guy
[1168.92 → 1170.32] named Eric Little.
[1170.44 → 1171.10] It's a true story.
[1171.64 → 1172.64] And he finds out
[1172.64 → 1173.52] that the race
[1173.52 → 1174.68] he was supposed to run in
[1174.68 → 1176.06] had been scheduled now
[1176.06 → 1176.84] to a Sunday.
[1177.54 → 1178.40] As a devout Christian,
[1178.48 → 1179.18] he didn't want to do
[1179.18 → 1179.86] anything on Sunday,
[1180.04 → 1180.62] so he says,
[1180.66 → 1181.38] ah, I'm out.
[1181.38 → 1183.42] And he gets put into,
[1183.54 → 1184.50] he asked him,
[1184.58 → 1185.36] can I do another race?
[1185.42 → 1186.24] And it's a race
[1186.24 → 1187.14] he hadn't trained for,
[1187.38 → 1188.30] but he runs it anyway.
[1188.94 → 1189.84] The first guy
[1189.84 → 1190.98] does a sprint thing
[1190.98 → 1191.72] and he runs
[1191.72 → 1193.04] and he wins,
[1193.78 → 1194.96] but he isn't satisfied.
[1196.02 → 1197.04] It's never enough.
[1198.06 → 1199.20] I proved my existence,
[1199.26 → 1200.44] I justified my existence
[1200.44 → 1201.24] in these 10 seconds,
[1201.58 → 1202.18] but now I've got to do it
[1202.18 → 1202.88] in these 10 seconds
[1202.88 → 1203.84] and in this 10 seconds,
[1204.22 → 1205.88] and it's just never
[1205.88 → 1206.50] going to be enough.
[1207.20 → 1207.62] Eric Little,
[1207.70 → 1208.36] on the other hand,
[1208.60 → 1209.22] didn't run
[1209.22 → 1210.30] to satisfy anybody.
[1210.30 → 1211.34] In fact,
[1211.38 → 1212.04] I was talking to somebody
[1212.04 → 1212.56] about the movie
[1212.56 → 1213.74] and there's a line
[1213.74 → 1214.44] in the movie
[1214.44 → 1215.42] where he's running
[1215.42 → 1216.38] and he says,
[1216.48 → 1217.30] I run because
[1217.30 → 1219.40] of the joy of running,
[1220.28 → 1221.22] the joy of being
[1221.22 → 1222.24] with God while I run.
[1223.52 → 1223.84] So he was,
[1224.36 → 1225.06] the motives were
[1225.06 → 1225.88] so different.
[1226.36 → 1226.76] But, you know,
[1226.80 → 1228.38] and so he was in Jesus,
[1228.82 → 1229.88] he knew life in Jesus
[1229.88 → 1231.48] was what he was living for,
[1231.76 → 1232.78] and so when it got moved
[1232.78 → 1233.54] and he had to adjust,
[1233.64 → 1234.56] well, he just adjusted.
[1236.22 → 1236.80] Interestingly enough,
[1236.82 → 1238.08] he won his race too,
[1238.18 → 1238.44] but anyway,
[1238.54 → 1239.02] that's not bad.
[1239.02 → 1241.02] Knowing all this,
[1241.18 → 1242.64] then you practice Sabbath,
[1242.76 → 1243.52] otherwise it's not
[1243.52 → 1244.28] going to work.
[1245.46 → 1245.88] Then it's,
[1246.14 → 1246.44] otherwise,
[1246.76 → 1247.58] if you think it's
[1247.58 → 1248.20] other things,
[1248.28 → 1248.86] it's you somehow,
[1249.10 → 1250.06] it's never enough,
[1250.30 → 1251.20] it's never good enough,
[1251.40 → 1252.32] you'll just keep running
[1252.32 → 1252.84] and running
[1252.84 → 1253.36] and running
[1253.36 → 1253.80] and running
[1253.80 → 1255.88] and never be satisfied.
[1259.18 → 1260.78] How do we practice this?
[1261.00 → 1261.94] Here are a few thoughts.
[1261.94 → 1264.56] You don't have to go through
[1264.56 → 1265.96] a list of dos and don'ts,
[1266.38 → 1268.08] how far you can walk
[1268.08 → 1268.54] and all that,
[1268.80 → 1270.20] but some structures
[1270.20 → 1271.30] are important.
[1272.14 → 1272.72] Some structures
[1272.72 → 1273.56] are important.
[1273.84 → 1274.48] They can be helpful.
[1275.04 → 1276.36] The practice of Sabbath
[1276.36 → 1277.36] is essential.
[1278.94 → 1279.20] You know,
[1279.40 → 1280.76] I'm going to walk 15 steps
[1280.76 → 1281.10] and all,
[1281.32 → 1281.52] okay,
[1281.64 → 1282.06] no, no, no,
[1282.06 → 1282.50] not that.
[1283.32 → 1284.50] In a sense,
[1284.58 → 1285.28] I think what's important
[1285.28 → 1285.60] to remember
[1285.60 → 1286.26] that, yeah,
[1286.36 → 1287.08] there are certain
[1287.08 → 1287.90] disciplines involved,
[1288.14 → 1288.76] but Sabbath,
[1288.98 → 1289.88] according to Scripture,
[1289.88 → 1291.10] is liberation.
[1293.44 → 1294.88] In the book of Deuteronomy,
[1295.04 → 1296.28] Deuteronomy 15,
[1297.52 → 1298.94] way in the Old Testament there,
[1299.02 → 1299.70] talking to the people
[1299.70 → 1300.08] of Israel,
[1300.60 → 1300.78] right,
[1300.88 → 1302.44] this chapter is all about
[1302.44 → 1303.70] all these Sabbath things,
[1304.12 → 1305.56] a Sabbath for the land
[1305.56 → 1306.36] in seven years,
[1306.84 → 1308.46] a Sabbath for debt
[1308.46 → 1309.32] being forgiven.
[1310.24 → 1310.82] Imagine that
[1310.82 → 1311.60] in seven years,
[1311.66 → 1311.80] right,
[1312.14 → 1314.20] debt is forgiven,
[1314.30 → 1314.38] right,
[1314.42 → 1315.18] all kinds of things,
[1315.28 → 1316.58] all lifestyle things.
[1317.38 → 1318.64] And so then,
[1318.64 → 1320.98] God says this,
[1321.26 → 1322.46] remember that you
[1322.46 → 1324.28] were slaves in Egypt
[1324.28 → 1327.00] and the Lord your God
[1327.00 → 1328.20] redeemed you.
[1329.64 → 1330.96] That is why I give you
[1330.96 → 1331.44] this command.
[1332.86 → 1334.58] Out of that knowledge,
[1335.20 → 1335.78] do Sabbath.
[1338.28 → 1339.06] Do Sabbath.
[1339.18 → 1339.94] Out of that knowledge.
[1341.50 → 1343.06] Remember you were slaves
[1343.06 → 1344.06] and you were freed.
[1344.24 → 1345.14] Therefore observe Sabbath.
[1345.14 → 1348.90] slaves don't get days off.
[1351.10 → 1352.60] They just keep going
[1352.60 → 1353.32] and keep going.
[1353.56 → 1355.08] If you don't rest,
[1355.48 → 1356.78] you are a slave.
[1360.52 → 1361.48] A lot of you
[1361.48 → 1362.72] are always too busy.
[1362.98 → 1364.32] If you can't set aside
[1364.32 → 1364.96] some time,
[1365.24 → 1366.76] you're living like a slave.
[1367.22 → 1368.26] Slave to activities,
[1368.48 → 1369.72] slave to your insecurities,
[1370.08 → 1371.14] slave to expectations,
[1371.40 → 1372.26] slaves to culture,
[1372.70 → 1373.90] slaves to technology.
[1373.90 → 1375.72] Lots of ways to be slaves.
[1376.10 → 1376.84] And you have to say
[1376.84 → 1377.90] deep within you,
[1378.32 → 1379.76] Sabbath is an act
[1379.76 → 1380.90] where I am recognized,
[1381.66 → 1381.90] I am liberated
[1382.56 → 1383.50] in the saving
[1383.50 → 1384.46] and finished work
[1384.46 → 1384.90] of Jesus Christ.
[1388.50 → 1389.82] That's what we're doing here.
[1391.74 → 1393.30] It is an act of acknowledging
[1393.30 → 1394.36] God is God alone
[1394.36 → 1395.64] and He frees me.
[1396.72 → 1398.12] And then like the psalmist,
[1398.24 → 1398.94] we acknowledge,
[1399.26 → 1402.10] He who watches over you
[1402.10 → 1403.68] neither slumbers nor sleep.
[1403.92 → 1404.98] Isn't that good news?
[1405.12 → 1406.68] I can even go to sleep
[1406.68 → 1409.68] knowing that the God
[1409.68 → 1411.08] of the universe is at it.
[1412.18 → 1412.96] And so I should be able
[1412.96 → 1413.72] to rest easy.
[1414.90 → 1415.86] Albeit that's sometimes
[1415.86 → 1416.96] hard for us to do too.
[1417.86 → 1419.02] We can be weak.
[1419.14 → 1419.38] Why?
[1419.52 → 1420.48] Because God isn't.
[1422.78 → 1423.48] Wendell Berry,
[1423.70 → 1425.02] an activist and farmer
[1425.02 → 1426.98] and a guy from quite a while back.
[1427.16 → 1427.76] But he writes,
[1428.70 → 1429.58] he writes,
[1429.68 → 1430.92] it's easy to imagine
[1430.92 → 1432.56] that the next great division
[1432.56 → 1433.16] in the world
[1433.16 → 1434.16] will be between people
[1434.16 → 1435.08] who wish to live
[1435.08 → 1436.32] as living creatures
[1436.32 → 1437.88] and those who wish
[1437.88 → 1438.94] to live as machines.
[1440.40 → 1441.12] It's always going,
[1441.22 → 1441.56] always going,
[1441.66 → 1441.96] always going,
[1442.02 → 1442.34] always going,
[1442.40 → 1442.72] always going.
[1445.42 → 1447.24] As the psalmist also says,
[1447.34 → 1447.48] you know,
[1447.52 → 1448.16] I lie down,
[1448.80 → 1449.66] I sleep,
[1450.08 → 1450.92] I wake up
[1450.92 → 1452.62] because the Lord sustains me.
[1453.10 → 1454.20] And there's this rest thing.
[1454.52 → 1455.14] When I rest,
[1455.28 → 1455.84] I say,
[1456.00 → 1456.74] hey, God's on it.
[1457.50 → 1458.12] And that's good.
[1459.02 → 1459.98] It's countercultural.
[1460.58 → 1461.78] Rest is the confession
[1461.78 → 1463.28] that is countercultural.
[1463.46 → 1464.88] We are not sufficient.
[1465.42 → 1466.44] We need care.
[1466.96 → 1467.78] We need God.
[1469.44 → 1470.68] And then this shows up
[1470.68 → 1471.68] in how we live
[1471.68 → 1472.74] and in our routines,
[1473.34 → 1474.24] including Sabbath.
[1475.14 → 1476.58] One writer put this question forward.
[1476.66 → 1477.38] I thought it was a good one.
[1477.88 → 1478.68] What if Christians
[1478.68 → 1479.56] were known as
[1479.56 → 1480.74] countercultural community
[1480.74 → 1482.54] of well-rested people
[1482.54 → 1485.04] who embrace our limits
[1485.04 → 1486.08] with zest and joy?
[1487.42 → 1488.08] Isn't that interesting?
[1489.66 → 1489.90] I said,
[1489.96 → 1491.26] boy, you seem really well-rested.
[1491.28 → 1492.02] You must be a Christian.
[1494.66 → 1496.06] It'd be a fascinating thing, right?
[1496.92 → 1497.50] Hyped up,
[1497.60 → 1498.48] stressed out Christian.
[1498.64 → 1499.86] I know they exist.
[1500.42 → 1501.14] We're all them people.
[1501.24 → 1502.48] We are all those people sometimes.
[1502.80 → 1503.56] But it is not
[1503.56 → 1505.02] what Christ would have us be
[1505.02 → 1505.32] in those.
[1505.92 → 1506.76] He would ask us
[1506.76 → 1507.68] to be a people of rest.
[1508.46 → 1509.14] So each night
[1509.14 → 1510.24] when you go to sleep,
[1510.74 → 1512.14] in a sense,
[1512.28 → 1513.44] practice the Sabbath
[1513.44 → 1514.24] of letting go.
[1515.58 → 1517.00] Each Sabbath day,
[1517.42 → 1518.70] this rhythm of Sundays,
[1519.04 → 1519.86] we slow down,
[1519.94 → 1520.60] admitting life
[1520.60 → 1522.04] isn't all about our striving,
[1522.46 → 1523.32] but it's about
[1523.32 → 1525.60] recognizing that God is God
[1525.60 → 1527.00] and we rest in Him.
[1527.38 → 1528.84] And my work does not define me.
[1529.04 → 1530.04] Christ defines me.
[1530.04 → 1534.18] When I was going through
[1534.18 → 1536.48] a time of burnt,
[1536.74 → 1537.78] I was kind of burnt out,
[1538.96 → 1539.82] a time when I was running
[1539.82 → 1540.58] way too hard
[1540.58 → 1541.64] and I couldn't do it anymore.
[1541.84 → 1543.04] I was running on my own strength
[1543.04 → 1544.00] and rarely stopping.
[1545.42 → 1546.62] I got some counselling
[1546.62 → 1548.36] and spent some time
[1548.36 → 1550.00] taking the sabbatical
[1550.00 → 1550.66] in those days.
[1552.34 → 1553.56] Psalm 121,
[1553.64 → 1554.18] verse 1 or 2
[1554.18 → 1555.18] became important to me.
[1555.90 → 1556.64] Let me read it to you.
[1556.64 → 1557.34] Psalm 121,
[1557.40 → 1557.98] verse 1 or 2.
[1560.02 → 1560.58] A picture
[1560.58 → 1562.42] often happened,
[1562.50 → 1563.64] I was working at my desk,
[1564.96 → 1566.06] window over here,
[1567.46 → 1569.38] and I'd be anxious,
[1570.52 → 1571.02] fretting,
[1571.32 → 1571.98] stressed out.
[1573.26 → 1574.56] And then I would think
[1574.56 → 1575.04] of the verse,
[1575.82 → 1576.72] I lift,
[1576.82 → 1577.02] okay,
[1577.14 → 1578.20] so here's all the stress,
[1578.92 → 1580.38] and I lift my eyes
[1580.38 → 1581.76] to those mountains,
[1581.76 → 1583.34] and then I ask,
[1583.48 → 1585.44] from where will my help come?
[1586.62 → 1587.90] My help comes
[1587.90 → 1589.12] from the Lord,
[1589.42 → 1590.78] the maker of heaven
[1590.78 → 1591.54] and earth.
[1595.20 → 1596.42] And I was refocused.
[1597.82 → 1598.66] And that happened
[1598.66 → 1599.80] several times a day.
[1601.12 → 1602.68] I still think that way.
[1602.76 → 1603.58] That verse still means
[1603.58 → 1604.28] a lot to me.
[1605.60 → 1607.24] A little mini Sabbath
[1607.24 → 1609.20] in the midst of busy days.
[1610.34 → 1611.24] Busyness is not really
[1611.24 → 1611.66] the problem.
[1611.74 → 1612.24] It's maybe more
[1612.24 → 1613.40] our mindset in some ways.
[1613.90 → 1614.68] A needed reminder
[1614.68 → 1615.34] about what the point
[1615.34 → 1615.78] of life is.
[1615.96 → 1616.80] I trust God.
[1616.90 → 1617.94] He keeps the world running,
[1617.98 → 1618.40] not me.
[1618.70 → 1619.56] He invites me in
[1619.56 → 1620.46] on what He's up to.
[1621.06 → 1623.18] And I think for a lot of us,
[1623.22 → 1624.58] we could do these mini Sabbaths.
[1624.58 → 1625.04] It's not just
[1625.04 → 1625.94] the Sunday thing here.
[1626.40 → 1627.52] Go for a little walk.
[1627.64 → 1628.70] Go fishing.
[1629.30 → 1630.46] Lift your eyes
[1630.46 → 1631.18] to the mountains,
[1631.30 → 1631.82] to the hills,
[1632.18 → 1633.62] and in that rest,
[1633.72 → 1634.74] remind yourself
[1634.74 → 1635.74] who you are
[1635.74 → 1637.14] and what the point
[1637.14 → 1637.88] of it all is.
[1638.22 → 1639.42] You are a child of God,
[1639.42 → 1640.08] we sang that,
[1640.34 → 1641.44] who is dearly loved
[1641.44 → 1643.34] and completely cleansed.
[1647.26 → 1648.30] And that ought to lead us
[1648.30 → 1648.70] to worship.
[1652.76 → 1653.10] You know,
[1653.18 → 1655.46] I find over the years
[1655.46 → 1655.98] more and more
[1655.98 → 1657.28] I listen to songs
[1657.28 → 1658.62] that stir my soul
[1658.62 → 1659.42] and my heart.
[1660.80 → 1661.60] My wife and I,
[1661.66 → 1662.78] when we go on road trips,
[1662.90 → 1663.48] we love to listen
[1663.48 → 1664.46] to worship music together
[1664.46 → 1665.10] and sing together.
[1667.02 → 1667.60] My wife,
[1667.90 → 1668.32] once in a while,
[1668.42 → 1669.76] wants to raise her hand
[1669.76 → 1672.18] so I open the sunroof
[1672.18 → 1673.40] so she can get the hand
[1673.40 → 1673.86] all the way up.
[1676.78 → 1677.60] It's a beautiful thing
[1677.60 → 1678.20] to sing together
[1678.20 → 1679.10] and worship together.
[1681.00 → 1681.52] Parents too,
[1681.58 → 1682.30] with your kids too.
[1683.36 → 1684.32] It's harder with teenagers,
[1684.46 → 1684.84] that's different.
[1687.22 → 1687.58] Right?
[1687.58 → 1688.28] And it's Sabbath.
[1688.64 → 1688.76] Be,
[1689.06 → 1690.26] we are accountable
[1690.26 → 1691.38] to each other
[1691.38 → 1692.26] for Sabbath.
[1693.12 → 1694.40] It's a community event.
[1694.58 → 1695.96] We remember together,
[1696.14 → 1697.46] we remind each other,
[1697.74 → 1698.90] we encourage together.
[1699.00 → 1699.30] That's why
[1699.30 → 1700.96] the writer of Hebrews 10,
[1701.04 → 1702.10] 25 says this,
[1702.24 → 1703.02] 24 and 25,
[1703.42 → 1704.42] let us consider,
[1704.60 → 1704.76] okay,
[1704.80 → 1705.32] how are we going to do this?
[1705.54 → 1706.28] Let us consider
[1706.28 → 1707.66] how we may spur one another
[1707.66 → 1708.94] on toward love
[1708.94 → 1709.72] and good deeds.
[1709.80 → 1710.10] Oh wow,
[1710.18 → 1711.72] that's a beautiful goal here.
[1711.82 → 1712.46] How is that going to be?
[1712.92 → 1715.10] Not giving up
[1715.10 → 1716.44] meeting together
[1716.44 → 1717.82] as some are in the habit
[1717.82 → 1718.12] of doing,
[1718.40 → 1719.70] but encouraging one another.
[1719.92 → 1720.46] And you can only
[1720.46 → 1721.42] encourage one another
[1721.42 → 1722.70] when you're together.
[1725.14 → 1726.06] When we're here.
[1727.22 → 1727.82] And all the more
[1727.82 → 1728.78] as you see the day approaching,
[1728.84 → 1729.46] all the more as you see
[1729.46 → 1730.20] the end of time coming.
[1732.68 → 1733.08] Folks,
[1733.46 → 1734.30] if it's not,
[1734.44 → 1735.88] if Sabbath is not part
[1735.88 → 1736.94] of your routines
[1736.94 → 1738.00] for your family,
[1738.12 → 1738.74] for yourself,
[1738.94 → 1739.70] with music,
[1739.90 → 1740.62] with scripture,
[1741.14 → 1742.34] with gathering on Sundays,
[1742.52 → 1743.32] if it's not part
[1743.32 → 1744.36] of your routine,
[1744.52 → 1746.20] it's not going to happen.
[1748.06 → 1748.86] It's just not.
[1748.86 → 1752.18] There will be
[1752.18 → 1754.32] so many reasons
[1754.32 → 1755.68] to not stop
[1755.68 → 1757.44] and just to keep going
[1757.44 → 1759.36] and floating along
[1759.36 → 1760.38] in an unhealthy way.
[1761.28 → 1761.74] And in that,
[1762.26 → 1763.26] you'll miss the real point
[1763.26 → 1763.62] of life.
[1764.02 → 1764.52] And in that,
[1764.60 → 1765.66] you'll forget who you are.
[1766.58 → 1767.40] Because the world
[1767.40 → 1767.98] will be constantly
[1767.98 → 1768.86] trying to define you.
[1771.86 → 1773.00] I'm going to remember
[1773.00 → 1774.12] who I am
[1774.12 → 1776.26] and what the ultimate point is.
[1776.26 → 1778.58] because I'm with you.
[1781.84 → 1782.98] And my eyes
[1782.98 → 1784.24] will stay on the one
[1784.24 → 1784.80] who said,
[1785.06 → 1786.40] it's all good.
[1787.50 → 1788.38] It's good.
[1789.10 → 1789.98] And so are you.
[1790.72 → 1792.14] Because my son came
[1792.14 → 1793.44] and in him,
[1794.16 → 1794.74] it's finished.
[1796.36 → 1797.30] So follow him.
[1797.72 → 1798.14] Let's pray.
[1798.14 → 1803.44] Father God,
[1803.48 → 1804.28] we come before you
[1804.28 → 1805.78] and we thank you
[1805.78 → 1806.50] that you are the Lord
[1806.50 → 1807.02] of the Sabbath.
[1807.22 → 1808.44] You are the Lord of time.
[1809.68 → 1809.86] Lord,
[1809.94 → 1811.24] may we build our lives
[1811.24 → 1812.98] around you.
[1814.70 → 1815.78] You give us work.
[1815.86 → 1816.82] That's a wonderful thing.
[1817.60 → 1818.76] You give us opportunities.
[1818.96 → 1819.76] That's a good thing.
[1819.94 → 1821.44] But you also give us rest.
[1821.72 → 1822.58] You give us moments
[1822.58 → 1823.30] to stop
[1823.30 → 1824.64] and recalibrate
[1824.64 → 1825.50] and refocus
[1825.50 → 1827.98] and remind ourselves again
[1827.98 → 1830.30] that you are the Lord
[1830.30 → 1832.20] and we follow you
[1832.20 → 1833.52] and we work
[1833.52 → 1834.42] because you invite us
[1834.42 → 1834.86] into it.
[1835.58 → 1835.92] Lord,
[1836.00 → 1837.32] I pray that you bless us
[1837.32 → 1837.90] as a community
[1837.90 → 1839.00] that we might encourage
[1839.00 → 1839.50] each other.
[1839.82 → 1841.24] That we might not neglect
[1841.24 → 1842.24] meeting together
[1842.24 → 1844.22] because in the meeting together
[1844.22 → 1845.52] your spirit comes
[1845.52 → 1847.10] and we are again
[1847.10 → 1848.00] reminded together
[1848.00 → 1849.10] that we are loved
[1849.10 → 1850.24] and that the finished work
[1850.24 → 1850.72] of Jesus
[1850.72 → 1852.04] is the point of our lives.
[1853.30 → 1853.64] So Lord,
[1853.74 → 1854.10] thank you.
[1854.42 → 1855.26] Thank you for Sabbath.
[1855.72 → 1856.64] Thank you for rest.
[1857.30 → 1858.34] And thank you for loving us
[1858.34 → 1860.16] and saying to each of us,
[1860.60 → 1861.40] you are loved
[1861.40 → 1863.12] and you are very good.
