[0.00 → 5.04] um we are starting a new sermon series today for the next four weeks and this sermon series is
[5.04 → 10.64] called your story and just a bit of backstory behind what this series is about it actually
[10.64 → 14.32] comes from some conversation with people who are new to our church new to the Christian faith
[14.32 → 18.16] and they said hey like we didn't grow up in the church we didn't grow up with Christianity we'd
[18.16 → 22.80] love for you to do some teaching on some of the basics of what you believe about the bible about
[22.80 → 26.96] Christianity and so the way we're going to do this series is we're going to start with the gospel like
[26.96 → 31.60] what is the gospel that's today's sermon and next week Jonathan's going to be preaching on the story
[31.60 → 36.16] of the bible then we're going to look at the story of our culture and then finally on kickoff Sunday
[36.16 → 40.48] September 13 we're going to look at what does it mean to be faithful as a church living at the
[40.48 → 45.04] crossroads between our cultural story and living faithfully in the biblical story so that's where
[45.04 → 48.40] we're going and if you're new to the Christian faith I'm just thankful you're here for the
[48.40 → 53.76] conversation and I had people after the 9 a.m service ask me a bunch of questions uh so you're
[53.76 → 57.44] welcome to approach any of us as leaders and pastors we'd love to be part of a conversation
[57.44 → 64.24] if these sermons stir up those questions if you have a bible turn with me to first Corinthians 15
[64.96 → 70.56] we're going to read verses 1 to 8 where Paul literally says this is what I believe is the good news
[77.04 → 82.80] now brothers and sisters I want you to remind you of the gospel I preached to you which you received
[82.80 → 88.96] and on which you have taken your stand by this gospel you are saved if you hold firmly to the
[88.96 → 96.00] word I preached to you otherwise you've believed in vain for what I received I passed on to you as of
[96.00 → 102.08] first importance that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures that he was buried
[102.64 → 107.76] that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures and that he appeared to cafes that's
[107.76 → 113.52] peter and then to the 12 after that he appeared to more than 500 of the brothers and sisters at the
[113.52 → 119.12] same time most of whom are still living though some have fallen asleep then he appeared to jams
[119.12 → 124.56] then to all the apostles and last of all he appeared to me also as to one abnormally born
[124.56 → 138.00] well the dad paced around the hall of the hospital anxiously just a few minutes prior to that his
[138.00 → 143.36] wife was delivering what he was hoping to be their firstborn child and then all of a sudden a doctor
[143.36 → 147.44] came in the room, and he called in another doctor and there are voices talking back and forth and all
[147.44 → 151.60] of a sudden they rushed his wife out of the delivery room into a surgery room far down the hall
[151.60 → 158.16] and there he stood waiting wondering what's going on was his wife okay was the child okay were they
[158.16 → 163.36] going to make it and then what felt like an eternity later a nurse at the very end of the hall
[163.36 → 168.96] popped through the doors, and she was pushing this cart which had a little baby in it, and she said to
[168.96 → 176.72] the dad good news here is your baby daughter she's healthy, and your wife is going to be just fine too
[176.72 → 185.52] well you can imagine the wash of relief and joy fill that dad as he held his baby girl good news
[187.76 → 192.48] now of the many things that can be said about Christianity we really do believe that the centre
[192.48 → 201.76] of what we believe is good news not good advice not good ideas good news something happened that has to
[201.76 → 208.40] be shared something has taken place that we need to receive and talk about that's at the centre of
[208.40 → 214.08] the Christian faith and interestingly when the gospel writers put their quill to scroll, and they tell
[214.08 → 220.56] the story of Jesus and what he did the word they use the Greek word is evangelion you know what that means
[221.44 → 228.24] gospel you know what gospel means good news they couldn't help but talk about Jesus without saying
[228.24 → 234.56] the person that we're telling you about the things that happened to him are good news and that's why
[234.56 → 239.04] the first four books in the New Testament are the Gospel of Luke the Gospel of John the Gospel of Matthew
[239.04 → 246.32] the Gospel of Mark it's good news and when Paul talking to the church in Corinth starts talking about
[246.32 → 252.16] the deep centre of what they believe he says let me read it for you brothers and sisters I want to
[252.16 → 258.80] remind you of the gospel the good news I preach to you which you have received and on which you take
[258.80 → 268.48] your stand by this gospel the good news you are saved now I want to name a challenge that we live in
[268.48 → 275.84] or have now that we live in the 21st century it's been 2023 years since Jesus and as the Christianity
[275.84 → 280.48] has spread in different places there's different denominations people answer differently the question
[280.48 → 285.76] what is the gospel in fact in surge our discipleship group that we have every year at hope I often will
[285.76 → 292.40] get people when they start this group to say hey what do you say is the gospel let me ask you know
[292.40 → 295.76] let's say you get into an elevator with someone you're going up 10 floors, and they know you're
[295.76 → 300.64] a Christian that is it hey like what's your faith all about what is the gospel that Christians talk
[300.64 → 306.48] about what would you say what's your one to two to three sentence summary of the Christian faith
[306.48 → 314.08] that you hold what would you say you thinking about it keep that in your mind because we're
[314.08 → 319.60] going to come back to that question now if you're curious, or you're confused even what you would say
[319.60 → 325.92] Paul is here to help because in this passage Paul's talking to a very broken church you know this is a
[325.92 → 329.84] church that gets not one letter but two letters it's never a good sign when you get two letters from
[329.84 → 333.84] Paul it's like I've already written you now I'm writing you again and I read a meme just like two
[333.84 → 338.48] weeks ago where it said you know if Jesus or sorry Paul visited our city in our churches
[339.20 → 345.68] we'd be getting a letter too but in this letter to a very broken church Paul near the end says all
[345.68 → 351.28] right this is the centre of what we believe this is what makes us church these are the convictions
[351.28 → 357.92] that change the world and this is what he writes starting at verse three for what I received I pass on
[357.92 → 364.88] to you as of first importance number one that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures
[364.88 → 369.92] number two that he was buried and there's some debate about people thinking maybe he was resuscitated he
[369.92 → 375.44] didn't actually die so no he was buried number three that he was raised on the third day according to
[375.44 → 383.36] the scriptures and number four that he appeared to peter the twelve more than 500 and then also to Paul
[383.36 → 390.32] himself there is a lot packed in this passage let me say the first thing number one notice how important
[390.32 → 396.00] this is to Paul he says what I'm about to tell you is the most important thing you can know about and
[396.00 → 402.56] believe in nothing is more important than Jesus and what was accomplished in his life death and
[402.56 → 410.00] resurrection, and you must reckon with that if you come to believe in him, he is therefore the foundation
[410.00 → 415.04] of everything you live for and nothing else can be more important not your money not your time not
[415.04 → 424.24] your relationships everything is built on Jesus nothing is more important secondly I want to suggest
[424.24 → 430.88] that it's really important that we recognize that Christianity is not just ideas or morals or good
[430.88 → 435.04] teaching on how to live a lot of people when you ask them what's Christianity oh it's this guy who gave
[435.04 → 439.68] some good teachings on how we're supposed to live that is true Jesus did that but at the centre of
[439.68 → 445.44] Christianity is an event something happened interestingly I just read a few weeks ago there
[445.44 → 450.56] was a fellow who tried to compile all the teachings of different religious literature so he took the
[450.56 → 456.16] Quran he took the bible he took the grant sahib the Sikh literature, and he tried to distill everything
[456.16 → 462.24] down to like 400 specific teachings, and he said there it is all the religious teachings buy my book you've
[462.24 → 466.32] got everything you don't need to go to all these different religious literatures there it is you can live by
[466.32 → 471.04] these 400 things and when I heard about that I thought he missed the whole point of Christianity
[471.04 → 476.16] because Christianity at the centre is not just about ideas on how to live your life it's about
[476.16 → 481.28] something that happened to a person in the first century and there are well over 500 witnesses who said
[481.28 → 488.16] this Jesus who lived in the first century a Jewish man lived he was died that was witnessed, and he rose and
[488.16 → 495.28] that was witnessed, and we must then wrestle with what it means everyone has to make sense of that event we
[495.28 → 498.88] have to take seriously the testimony of these people and say okay if it's true that Jesus rose
[498.88 → 508.96] from the dead what does that mean now here's the thing we can't talk about Jesus without telling a
[508.96 → 514.00] story you can't say anything really meaningful about Jesus without saying okay what's what's he there
[514.00 → 517.60] for why did he come what were his claims what is the story that makes sense of his life and that's
[517.60 → 522.96] actually true of all of us our lives only make sense within a story the events of our lives only make
[522.96 → 528.00] sense within a story a good example of this not my favourite, but it works is a murder mystery anyone
[528.00 → 533.52] here like good murder mysteries the murder mystery at most anyway they start with an event how someone
[533.52 → 538.16] died the event you know someone got hit with a candlestick in the library and then the rest of
[538.16 → 543.44] the story the movie is giving you plausible narratives that make sense of why that event happened
[543.44 → 547.84] and the same is true of Jesus there's an event his life his death his resurrection his appearance to
[547.84 → 553.36] people, and now we have to say what's the story that makes sense of what Jesus did and there were
[553.36 → 558.96] stories then you know in the Roman world they saw Jesus as some strange religious zealot who's sort of
[558.96 → 563.68] stirring people up making pretty big claims about being a king challenging the emperor and so they
[563.68 → 568.40] said that's enough of that we're going to execute you and show you who's boss you are not than there
[568.40 → 573.20] are the Jews who said hey this guy's a heretic he's claiming to be god he's just a human, and they think
[573.20 → 578.32] this guy got what he deserved he was crucified that's the end of that and today of course there's
[578.32 → 584.64] lots of different narratives for Jesus most people say interesting religious rabbi lots of teachings on
[584.64 → 589.44] how to live definitely did not rise from the dead let's move on with our lives and enjoy the gifts of
[589.44 → 597.60] science and technology to lead us to a better world, but a story makes sense of Jesus and Paul tells us the
[597.60 → 603.60] story we need to ground Jesus in did you notice what he repeats twice in our passage what's the phrase
[603.60 → 611.84] he repeats twice in our passage according to the scriptures Jesus died for our sins according to our
[611.84 → 616.88] scriptures he rose on the third day according to the scriptures and when Paul says according to the
[616.88 → 622.96] scriptures he's talking about the Old Testament story he's saying that's the story that makes sense
[622.96 → 628.72] of why Jesus came that's the story Jesus himself was living in and claiming to fulfill you can't
[628.72 → 636.56] understand Jesus without the Old Testament story you know who else by the way told us to make sense of
[636.56 → 644.00] Jesus life in light of the Old Testament Jesus did one of my favourite stories in the bible the road to
[644.00 → 650.48] Emmaus Luke chapter 24 Jesus in his resurrected state he's got his body walking away from Jerusalem he
[650.48 → 654.64] finds these two travellers who are distraught discouraged they thought Jesus was something but
[654.64 → 659.28] he died they're walking away in sadness Jesus comes along, and he starts listening to them talking to
[659.28 → 663.52] them they invite Jesus in for a meal could you imagine this scene, and they're eating with him
[663.52 → 669.68] and all of a sudden their eyes are opened, and he says I want to tell you from the beginning how i
[669.68 → 675.68] fulfill the law and the prophets how the Old Testament is all fulfilled in what I have done on the cross
[675.68 → 681.68] Jesus the resurrected saviour says the story that makes sense of me is the Old Testament
[683.04 → 688.00] now you should know next Sunday pastor Jonathan is going to be preaching on the whole story of the
[688.00 → 693.52] bible no pressure at all Jonathan and I'm going to do my best not to steal from Jonathan's
[693.52 → 698.64] sermon but I'm going to steal from Jonathan's sermon right now because you can't talk about the
[698.64 → 702.96] gospel without the story, and you can't understand the story without the gospel, and so I am shamelessly
[702.96 → 706.72] stealing from his sermon next week that's okay he's got to do the whole bible in one sermon he'll
[706.72 → 713.60] forgive me later I think we believe that the bible is not just a random collection of stories
[714.24 → 718.48] and when I was a youth pastor that's how students sought a random collection of confusing stories
[718.48 → 724.72] it is one unfolding narrative from beginning to end it starts with a beautiful creation that god places
[724.72 → 731.68] humans in to enjoy cultivating to develop, and it finishes with a perfected creation that humans get
[731.68 → 737.52] to enjoy in the presence of god again it starts with a garden it finishes with the city it starts
[737.52 → 742.80] with god dwelling with us in this world, and it finishes with god dwelling with us in this world
[744.24 → 751.04] in the middle we get the plot and near the beginning we get the problem we'll talk about this more next
[751.04 → 757.36] week but the problem that comes into god's good creation is humans saying to god we'll take it from here
[757.36 → 763.28] we'll rule the show we'll live by our own measure we'll push you at a distance and out of that comes
[763.28 → 770.64] this awful parasitic reality of sin and before I say any more about sin if you're new to the faith or
[770.64 → 775.20] you're asking questions about the faith I just want to say this every person has to make sense of the
[775.20 → 780.56] mess of this world every person needs to give some explanation whether it's in the back of their head or
[780.56 → 785.84] it's spoken out loud you need to make sense of the mess and the bible does a phenomenal job
[786.48 → 793.04] making sense of the mess the Old Testament is brutally honest about injustice violence hatred
[793.04 → 798.32] warfare all of it is in the bible because it's honest about the problem, and they know where it came
[798.32 → 804.80] from human rebellion which breaks relationship with god it ruptures relationships with each other
[804.80 → 810.40] family friends all of it is puts us at a difference and not in sync with our creation itself and even
[810.40 → 816.88] puts us at odds with ourselves we are not integrated whole people any more we're broken our compromised
[816.88 → 823.12] desires mess with us, and we make a mess of our lives as we chase after idols as we put our hopes and things
[823.12 → 827.92] that can't save us as we try to find meaning outside a relationship with the living god the old
[827.92 → 835.68] testament tells story after story of humans chasing after destruction because of sin, but the plot moves
[835.68 → 843.20] forward because god who sees his world descend into pain descend into corruption says I will not let
[844.00 → 851.20] humans wreck my good creation I will not let humans have the last word over the creation that I say
[851.92 → 858.56] good and so god builds relationship with Israel he draws them to himself he reveals his intentions and
[858.56 → 863.36] over and over and over and over he shows them I'm in control and I'm making all things new
[865.28 → 870.08] at the end of the Old Testament actually throughout it, you find the people of god and even other nations
[870.72 → 876.56] experiencing the brutality of a broken world crying out for saving crying out for justice crying out for
[876.56 → 882.48] the poor to be rescued crying out for god to give forgiveness over sin and then in the middle of the story
[882.48 → 891.68] we get this Jewish man who has the audacity to get out into the public and say these audacious words
[892.64 → 903.20] good news the kingdom of god is near repent and believe now if I had more time I'd go into a lot of
[903.20 → 909.36] detail but I'm just going to summarize Jesus statement very briefly when Jesus says good news what he means to
[909.36 → 918.00] say is the power of god the authority of god to deal with the problem of sin to stand against the
[918.00 → 925.36] oppressive deception of Satan and to overturn the finality of the grave that has come through Jesus
[926.24 → 930.72] and Jesus has the audacity to say I know what you've been waiting for I know what the world is groaning in
[930.72 → 938.64] and I've come to do what only god can do the kingdom of god is near what a bold claim
[939.92 → 948.56] right off the bat good news world I've come to do what only god can do now when we asked earlier
[948.56 → 954.24] how you would answer the question of what is the gospel I have a guess at what some of you said in your
[954.24 → 959.28] heads and in the 9 a.m service I had only one person nod with honesty I'm guessing that the first
[959.28 → 965.92] thing that came to your mind was Jesus died for my sin is that true oh only a couple more honest people
[965.92 → 970.72] it's a good answer Jesus did die for our sin, and he did release us from Satan so that we don't go to
[970.72 → 974.96] hell because that's often how it's framed Jesus died for our sins we're freed from it so that we
[974.96 → 980.88] don't go to hell we live with him in heaven, but you know what people often do is we skip over his life
[981.60 → 987.20] and I think that's too bad because Jesus life often helps us understand what his death is all of
[987.20 → 999.76] the way the world's supposed to be the way the world relation the way relationships are supposed
[999.76 → 1003.36] to be the way we're supposed to treat one another the way supposed to live the way our bodies are
[1003.36 → 1008.08] supposed to work all of it and if you've been at hope before you'll know that I talk about Jesus
[1008.08 → 1013.76] miracles as a snapshot of the kingdom of god when he heals bodies that are diseased it's his way of
[1013.76 → 1020.00] saying bodies in my good world are meant to be healthy when he casts out demons he's saying demonic
[1020.00 → 1025.12] power should not have any authority over bodies and people when he calms a storm he's saying it
[1025.12 → 1031.68] was not created for the world to be in disorder and forest fires and tsunamis Jesus gives us a picture
[1031.68 → 1036.48] of how the world's supposed to be at the beginning and the way it will be at the end and I want to
[1036.48 → 1041.60] read an extended quote this comes from a fellow named mark sayers Australian if you ever hear a podcast
[1041.60 → 1046.08] of his it's so much better than a Canadian voice because that Australian accent so hear his
[1046.08 → 1051.12] Australian accent but here's what he says about Jesus life and I just love this quote he writes
[1051.68 → 1059.76] Jesus life on earth points us toward the future his actions act as clues showing us how the story of
[1059.76 → 1066.40] creation will continue in the future Jesus healing of the disabled points to a time when humans will be
[1066.40 → 1072.32] healed physically and mentally Jesus deliverance of those possessed by evil demons point to a future
[1072.32 → 1078.00] when evil will be expelled from god's world Jesus feeding of those without food is a glimpse of a
[1078.00 → 1083.84] future where the world will there be no hunger poverty or starvation by turning over the tables of
[1083.84 → 1088.40] the merchants selling religious products in the temple Jesus shows that our future will be a time when
[1088.40 → 1096.16] our worship of god will not be compromised by corruption and greed Jesus honouring of women Samaritans
[1096.16 → 1103.12] and children speaks of a time when no humans will be marginalized and above all Jesus resurrection
[1103.12 → 1111.92] speaks of a time when death and suffering will be defeated, and the world will be resurrected then he ends
[1111.92 → 1116.96] on this light and fluffy note sadly though most Christians miss these illusions living as we do
[1116.96 → 1123.28] under the shadow of the hyperreal world, and we'll come back to that in a few weeks time as well do
[1123.28 → 1128.40] you hear what he's saying though when Jesus lives, and he's demonstrating with power the kingdom he's
[1128.40 → 1133.44] showing us this is where the future is going bodies will be healed the creation will be restored lives
[1133.44 → 1138.32] will be forgiven demons will be cast out and all will be made as it was created to be from the beginning
[1138.32 → 1145.84] when I return when I first started learning this stuff it blew my mind
[1147.28 → 1150.80] when I was a young adult and I started reading about the unity of the story of the bible all of
[1150.80 → 1157.84] a sudden I realized the gospel is so much bigger than I often thought it was and I can only speak
[1157.84 → 1162.56] personally but let me just say how I've kind of come around on this I realized quickly as I read
[1162.56 → 1167.76] the story of the bible and god's concern for his world that the gospel is about more than just individual
[1167.76 → 1174.40] forgiveness beautiful though that is I never tire of coming to worship and receiving the grace of Christ
[1174.40 → 1178.64] through the preaching through prayer and through singing I celebrate that we are forgiven as god's
[1178.64 → 1183.68] people, but the gospel is about more than that it's about more than just god in Jesus defeating the
[1183.68 → 1191.76] tempting power of Satan amazing though that is, and the gospel is about more than just him overpowering death
[1192.88 → 1200.88] the gospel is about Jesus bringing resurrection to the world it's about Jesus coming to his world that is
[1200.88 → 1208.80] marred by sin and saying I have been sent by my father to make all things new, and he says exactly
[1208.80 → 1214.64] that in Matthew 19 and the apostles in writing acts say the exact same thing about Jesus mission he has
[1214.64 → 1222.88] come to make all things new you know two quotes that come to mind one uh this is a very easy to remember
[1222.88 → 1227.52] one, but a teacher of mine back in the day said you know god don't make junk he's talking about the
[1227.52 → 1234.80] creation and god don't junk what he makes and through Jesus he restores his world, and we will
[1234.80 → 1240.00] see the renewal at the end when Jesus returns the other person is Chris Wright and I'm going to
[1240.00 → 1244.48] paraphrase here because I don't have an exact quote he says the goal of god in sending Jesus is not to
[1244.48 → 1250.80] clean us up and then bring us out of the world the goal of god in Jesus is to clean up the whole creation
[1250.80 → 1261.28] including us so that he can come and dwell with us here forever good news when I was a youth pastor
[1261.28 → 1265.36] I spent a lot of time teaching the story of the bible in fact some of you here were my youth and i just
[1265.36 → 1270.72] feel sad that you had to listen to this Dave grew and droning on and on about this but I remember just
[1270.72 → 1275.20] listening to you struggle with what the bible is about trying to make sense of this long story and i
[1275.20 → 1282.32] remember those moments of just like ah you mean to say that my life in this world is what god wants
[1282.32 → 1287.36] me to live you mean to say that my body matters and that my body matters enough to Jesus I'm going to
[1287.36 → 1293.44] rise to life again and enjoy the things I love in this world you mean to say that the home I live in the
[1293.44 → 1299.04] relationships I have all the stuff that's actually good in this world we get to enjoy forever and the
[1299.04 → 1307.60] answer is yes god's ultimate plan is to bring resurrection to this world and resurrection to our
[1307.60 → 1314.48] physical body so that we can enjoy this beautiful creation as we are intended to from the beginning that is
[1314.48 → 1324.48] good news that story transforms the generations of the generation of a god who has the power to make all things new
[1324.48 → 1332.40] now I'm going to finish with the danger with this too we will come back to in this series the danger
[1332.40 → 1338.80] is that every generation of Christians faces the temptation to number one neglect and then forget
[1338.80 → 1344.24] this story to let dust cover their bibles and not really know what it's about get confused by it and
[1344.24 → 1348.88] just leave it alone you know watch some more Netflix it's not that important blah blah blah and then what
[1348.88 → 1354.16] happens is another story and trust me we all are shaped by some story whether we know it or not
[1354.16 → 1359.44] another story comes in and shapes our lives or then co-ops the biblical story, and we get some weird
[1359.44 → 1365.12] messed up fusing of the biblical story with our cultural story that is what happens by the way
[1365.12 → 1370.96] in Corinthians when Paul writes to this church they are like full of the spirit they are loving this power
[1370.96 → 1375.36] they have they're speaking in tongues they're doing all sorts of prophecy and Paul saying to them
[1375.36 → 1379.76] you've got division between the wealthy and the poor you are obsessed with the elite with the
[1379.76 → 1385.68] philosophers all these big ideas you are so shaped by the Corinth story, and you are not living according
[1385.68 → 1390.80] to the scriptures, and he's saying to them, you need to learn church how to live according to the
[1390.80 → 1398.88] scriptures and the same is true today I don't think I need to talk about the challenges we all face in
[1398.88 → 1405.92] neglecting the biblical story reading it saturating it learning from it rooting our lives in it but we also
[1405.92 → 1411.60] need to take seriously how there's another story in our own culture that is shaping our hearts our
[1411.60 → 1417.92] ambitions our future plans and shaping our minds in a way that is not in tune with the biblical story
[1419.36 → 1423.52] let me give you a very poignant example of that there's a scholar by the name of Christian
[1424.40 → 1430.40] a number of years ago he did a study with 3 000 American teenagers most of whom were Christian
[1430.96 → 1435.12] and what he wanted to know is how do these teenagers articulate their faith like what is it that
[1435.12 → 1439.28] they say when they have to summarize what they believe about the world their deepest convictions
[1439.28 → 1444.64] about life, and he compiled all their answers into this document which then got turned into a book
[1444.64 → 1450.64] and what he concluded was this these Christians or sorry these teenagers are saying things that are
[1450.64 → 1457.20] actually very much not in sync with Christianity, and he said it's actually not Christianity he said
[1457.20 → 1463.44] what I'm hearing from them is he coined this category it's moralistic therapeutic deism
[1463.44 → 1471.60] moralistic therapeutic deism and I'll summarize it to you as follows most of the teens expressed a
[1471.60 → 1477.28] sense of god exists he created this world, and he watches over it in some way god wants people to be
[1477.28 → 1483.68] good nice and fair to each other as taught in the bible and in other world religions the central goal of
[1483.68 → 1491.36] life is to be happy and feel good about oneself god does not need to be particularly involved in one's life
[1491.36 → 1497.44] except when we need him, and then he comes in to resolve our problems good people go to heaven when
[1497.44 → 1503.68] they die that's the summary of moralistic therapeutic deism now there are insights in there I don't want to
[1503.68 → 1512.56] be trashing this but Christian smith goes on to say is this what the bible teaches is the goal of life to
[1512.56 → 1520.88] feel good about oneself, and then he goes on to ask well what's missing from moralistic therapeutic deism
[1520.88 → 1531.92] you know what's missing sin is missing you know what else is missing the gospel Jesus is missing from
[1531.92 → 1537.28] moralistic therapeutic deism, and he says what if we help people understand moving beyond this to say
[1537.28 → 1542.48] there actually is a god who's come in Christ and the deepest needs of our heart the deepest distortions
[1542.48 → 1547.04] in our hearts he's come to deal with and not only that he's come to heal the whole creation
[1548.48 → 1553.28] and I think all of us in some way have been affected by that moralistic therapeutic deism
[1553.28 → 1557.44] where we think of Christianity as god sort of doing what we need him to do so we can feel good about
[1557.44 → 1561.68] ourselves and the story of the bible is about much more than that
[1564.88 → 1572.16] in first Corinthians 15 Paul says to a church that has got its own brokenness he says this is the gospel
[1572.48 → 1578.00] and to the church today he says this is the gospel that Christ died according to the scriptures he was
[1578.00 → 1584.24] buried raised to life according to the scriptures, and he appeared and the only way we can understand
[1584.24 → 1589.60] what that means is the story and in the middle of that story comes this Jewish man who says the kingdom
[1589.60 → 1596.48] of god is near I have come to overturn the power of death I've come to stand against this tempting power
[1596.48 → 1606.24] of Satan and I have come to forgive sin and the invitation to every single person then and now
[1607.36 → 1616.16] is to repent and believe to turn away from the false gospels to turn away from the false stories and say
[1616.16 → 1623.76] Jesus I believe that you died and that you rose that salvation forgiveness freedom and the cosmic renewal of
[1623.76 → 1632.24] this world is real because of you, and we are invited to turn in our own lives to receive that good news
[1632.24 → 1640.80] and to take our stand I want to finish with the words that Jesus himself gives about his resurrection
[1640.80 → 1647.44] in john chapter 11. To people grieving their friend's death Jesus says I am the resurrection and the life
[1647.44 → 1653.36] the one who believes in me will live even though they die and whoever lives by believing in me will
[1653.36 → 1662.72] never die, and he finishes with this question I'll ask it to us as a church do you believe this good news
[1664.24 → 1665.28] let me lead us in prayer
[1665.28 → 1678.40] father we believe help us in our unbelief
[1681.52 → 1684.64] we ask that you would reveal to us the gospel
[1686.16 → 1692.08] that you would strip out of our hearts and our lives all the false gods and the false stories that we live
[1692.08 → 1700.88] out of and help us see that Jesus Christ is life would you fill us with hope that because the tomb is
[1700.88 → 1706.48] empty the future is secure would you fill us with confidence that when we take our stand on the gospel
[1706.48 → 1714.40] we have stood on something secure we thank you for salvation we thank you for the forgiveness of sins
[1714.40 → 1723.12] we thank you that Satan has been defeated, and we thank you that death is not the end praise you Jesus
[1723.12 → 1728.40] for what you have finished fill us with your spirit amen
