[0.00 → 10.14] Good morning, Ho. If you're in Cornerstone, ages 3 to grade 3, I think you can make your
[10.14 → 18.26] way upstairs. Join your teachers for Cornerstone. And as our kids are making their way up, we
[18.26 → 26.20] share this news. Sorry, also launch grades 4 to 7. Grades 4 to 7 for launch. Our youth,
[26.20 → 34.48] junior youth, can head on up, join your leaders as well. We share this good news in the 9am
[34.48 → 39.58] service. Mingy, who just prayed our communal prayer for us, he received some good news from
[39.58 → 45.08] the government a couple of days ago. Mingy and his family finally received their permanent residency
[45.08 → 52.12] for their status in Canada. So we praise God for the good news for their family.
[52.12 → 59.98] And so we are back in Jonah. Today we get to look at Jonah's anger. And so if you have your
[59.98 → 64.06] Bibles with you or your apps, please turn with me to Jonah chapter 4.
[64.06 → 80.16] But to Jonah, this seemed very wrong. And he became angry. He prayed to the Lord,
[80.30 → 85.48] isn't this what I said, Lord, when I was still at home? That is what I tried to forestall by going
[85.48 → 91.60] to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding
[91.60 → 101.86] in love. A God who relents from sending calamity. Now, Lord, take away, take away my life, for it is
[101.86 → 109.40] better for me to die than to live. But the Lord replied, Jonah, is it right for you to be angry?
[111.86 → 118.26] This past week, I was just joking with a couple of people about how I get to preach on Jonah's anger
[118.26 → 126.74] today. And then Dave has God's compassion next week. And we were just joking that Dave maybe thought
[126.74 → 132.02] I had anger management issues and that I should really reflect on what God is trying to say to me
[132.02 → 140.34] in my life. But it is ironic and funny, but also kind of true. I do have sinful ways with my anger.
[140.88 → 147.58] And hopefully what we get out of our text from Jonah is that we come to God in repentance as well,
[147.58 → 151.98] which I think is one of the main purposes of the book of Jonah, for the people of God.
[152.66 → 157.92] Now, as I was preparing for this sermon, I was reminded of a movie, which sort of connects with
[157.92 → 162.08] what Jonah is going through. For those of you who've seen Bruce Almighty, you'll understand what
[162.08 → 168.68] I'm talking about. Bruce Almighty, Bruce, played by Jim Carrey. If you don't, if you haven't watched it,
[168.86 → 173.90] a little bit of a spoiler, but hopefully it's not too much of a deal. I do recommend watching the movie.
[173.90 → 180.92] It has some significant insight. No, not insight. Significant thoughts, perspective about our lives
[180.92 → 186.78] as Christians as well. And so the story goes, as some of you know, Bruce, Jim Carrey plays God.
[187.36 → 194.96] He gets frustrated, angry at how God is doing godly things. And he says to God, God, if I were you,
[195.00 → 200.38] I'd do a better job. And then God takes up on that challenge and gives Bruce divine powers.
[200.38 → 206.54] So he's able to kind of like split the sea in his coffee and things like that. And as the movie
[206.54 → 214.42] progresses, in Bruce's human limitations, even with divine powers, he cannot achieve whatever he
[214.42 → 218.72] wants to achieve, all the desires that he's had in his life. And so the movie goes on and on,
[218.80 → 224.84] and his frustration actually even builds more with divine power in his hands. And at the end of the
[224.84 → 230.22] movie, one of the climax is he kneels down on a highway. I don't even know how he ended up on the
[230.22 → 237.92] highway, but he's on the highway. And then I quote what he says finally to God. I'm done, Bruce says.
[238.40 → 246.82] Please, I don't want to do this anymore. This is very striking. I don't want to be God. I want you to
[246.82 → 254.44] decide what's right for me. And then he screams, I surrender to your will. And then he gets hit by a
[254.44 → 262.86] truck. I mean, you're on a highway, right? That part is not necessarily part of our message today,
[263.10 → 271.20] but surrendering to God's will is. And I think that's very key. As we continue in our sermon
[271.20 → 276.36] series on Jonah, I believe, like I said, one of the main purposes is to induce and encourage people
[276.36 → 281.78] to think and reflect on our lives as those who confess God's will be done in our lives.
[282.50 → 289.28] And really think, do we live that way? Do we live as those who really believe the gospel? And Jesus'
[289.48 → 296.86] gospel was, repent for the kingdom is near. He starts off with a message of repentance.
[296.86 → 302.92] And specifically through Jonah's anger that we read this morning, I suggest that we are also called
[302.92 → 310.90] to repent, and specifically, like Jonah, to repent for a lack of trust, lack of obedience to God's will
[310.90 → 318.82] and judgment. And so, with this in mind, today's message is an echo from last week, as Dave reminded us
[318.82 → 325.62] to reflect on our lives, to live counter-culturally, to be a blessing for the world as we live in our cities.
[325.62 → 334.00] And we are again confronted, and I love how Dave said it last week. We are confronted with this message,
[334.34 → 340.48] get off your throne. Get off your throne. I mean, the language might be a bit strong, but I feel like it is
[340.48 → 348.12] the right message. It hit me personally as well. And today, as we hear this get off your throne message,
[348.74 → 355.34] we are to acknowledge the true king who's supposed to be on the throne, our God, whose ways may not always
[355.34 → 365.00] be what we expect or even what we want. And so, Jonah, as the prophet of Yahweh, his main mission was to go
[365.00 → 371.90] and prophesy to Nineveh. And as we, the readers of the story, and as the Israelites who read or heard
[371.90 → 379.28] the story originally, this story has the effect of, like I said, evoking repentance. It calls us to reflect
[379.28 → 386.06] on whether we have lived according to God's ways or not. So, here's the situation for Jonah. Remember,
[386.20 → 393.42] again, from last week, he preaches the shortest sermon ever. Forty more days, and then Nineveh will be
[393.42 → 401.28] overthrown. Overthrown is the key word here. This word, overthrown, is the same word that is used for the
[401.28 → 408.10] judgment and destruction against Sodom and Gomorrah. But, as I was studying and researching for the sermon,
[408.60 → 414.76] it was interesting that this same word for overthrow can have the connotation of turning oneself,
[415.42 → 424.94] of changing oneself, or to be changed in the passive voice. Like in Nehemiah 13 is an example.
[424.94 → 432.84] This word is used to describe how God so overthrew or turned, changed a curse into a blessing.
[434.32 → 439.82] And so, here's the irony. Even though Jonah may not have actually wanted it, even though Jonah may
[439.82 → 448.60] not have desired this, he was a successful prophet. He was able to evoke and challenge the pagan,
[448.60 → 457.30] non-Yahweh-worshipping Assyrians into repentance to the point where God actually relented from bringing
[457.30 → 463.92] the judgment of destruction on them as planned. So, for Jonah, he might have thought or even wished
[463.92 → 470.54] that Nineveh would not have repented and that God would bring sweet justice to those evildoers.
[471.42 → 477.90] But, lo and behold, they ended up repenting. And the result is, is that the Gentile pagan nation
[477.90 → 485.44] is blessed by Yahweh. Oh, the tragedy that our God blesses a city and a nation.
[486.76 → 493.22] And so, I hope you can see it with me, that the irony is, Jonah is angry. And the word
[493.22 → 500.44] Hara in Hebrew, it actually connotates, it actually means kindling, like fire kindling. So, the English
[500.44 → 505.86] expression fits perfectly here. He was burning with anger. He was furious.
[505.86 → 513.42] And the irony is that he was furious and angry at God for blessing a city and a nation.
[514.86 → 520.28] And he's angry specifically for himself in the situation that he was in, that he played a key
[520.28 → 524.40] instrument in God blessing a nation, an enemy nation.
[524.40 → 533.90] And God, the promise that he made to Abraham in the first place, to bless Abraham and his descendants,
[534.14 → 539.26] to be a blessing for all nations. God accomplished that mission, that covenant mission, and then
[539.26 → 542.78] Jonah takes that and becomes angry at God's judgment.
[542.78 → 556.60] And then, I should say, rather, Jonah turns around, and then he prays to God. Now, as I was reading this, I don't know what's better.
[557.26 → 563.00] His sermon, that short sermon to Nineveh, or this prayer. But this is what he says in verse 2.
[563.00 → 565.08] Jonah prayed to the Lord.
[566.00 → 568.48] Isn't this what I said, Lord, when I was still at home?
[569.06 → 572.06] That is what I tried to forestall by going to Tarshish.
[572.46 → 577.44] I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love.
[577.56 → 580.90] Chased, a God who relents from sending calamity.
[582.32 → 584.64] And then he stops, and then he says, please.
[584.88 → 586.82] I know it says now in our English translation.
[586.82 → 589.70] It's actually, please, he's pleading.
[590.92 → 594.78] Please, Lord, just take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.
[596.74 → 604.80] And it is also significant here that even though it may seem like Jonah has the accurate description of God's characteristic,
[605.82 → 610.18] he actually omits a key aspect, another key aspect of God's character,
[610.18 → 617.30] in that God is not just a God of mercy, but God is a God of mercy and justice.
[618.36 → 622.82] And it seems like Jonah is echoing Exodus, which we can see from Exodus 34.
[623.54 → 631.66] The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness,
[632.18 → 637.42] keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.
[637.42 → 641.62] This is where it seems like Jonah has stopped.
[642.30 → 649.82] He's angry at this part of God's characteristic, that he is loving, forgiving, and compassionate, merciful.
[651.10 → 653.14] But Exodus doesn't stop there.
[653.46 → 654.10] It goes on.
[654.22 → 658.44] But God, who will by no means clear the guilty,
[658.90 → 664.20] visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children to the third and fourth generation.
[664.20 → 671.34] And remember that Jonah was first called, in chapter 1, if you remember back,
[671.72 → 676.34] that he was called by God to go prophesy against Nineveh for their wickedness.
[677.14 → 684.26] For Jonah, in his perspective, he is right to assume that God would have put,
[684.78 → 689.14] was planning to bring destruction and judgment against the Assyrians.
[689.14 → 697.22] But here, as we know, God judges, God makes the judgment that he will relent
[697.22 → 700.34] and not bring destruction on Nineveh as they repent.
[701.14 → 704.54] God wants, and it reflects his merciful characteristic,
[704.92 → 708.24] that he wants to bring blessing to the world through a chosen people.
[708.72 → 711.88] And Jonah is the representative of that chosen people.
[711.88 → 716.00] His nickname is, nickname, his name means dove.
[716.50 → 719.86] And Israel's nickname was the dove of God.
[720.84 → 724.74] So Jonah, even linguistically, represents Israel.
[726.10 → 731.46] But that's the irony, that he has chosen to bring blessing.
[732.34 → 737.00] But then when God actually fulfills that blessing to an evil nation of Nineveh,
[737.36 → 739.20] he gets angry at God for this.
[739.20 → 743.76] And so I stopped here, and I asked,
[744.38 → 746.90] what is the good in this situation?
[747.24 → 748.40] What is the right thing?
[749.86 → 753.48] Is it Jonah's desire, I think a justified one,
[753.66 → 755.98] for wanting justice on an evil city?
[756.20 → 758.62] Or is it the evil city's repentance?
[759.12 → 761.66] What is the good in this specific situation for Jonah?
[761.66 → 765.92] I thought I could, in my head,
[766.38 → 769.24] make the argument that both answers can be good.
[769.88 → 771.26] Justice and mercy.
[772.32 → 775.36] But the underlying issue, and the message for us,
[775.92 → 777.32] is that the prophet Jonah,
[778.26 → 780.14] he does not accept,
[780.58 → 783.38] and is angry at God's will.
[784.14 → 786.64] Whether that be mercy or justice,
[786.64 → 792.70] God's perfect good will is what Jonah is getting angry at.
[794.10 → 798.90] Whether God's answer to our prayers is a yes, no, or wait,
[799.44 → 805.24] for Jonah, he did not have the posture of obedience and submission to God's will.
[805.24 → 810.28] Hence, I hope, and it did for me,
[810.56 → 813.24] it serves as a stark reminder of our own lives,
[813.66 → 816.38] as those who confess God to be the true judge.
[817.82 → 819.10] Again, I ask,
[819.40 → 824.86] do we really live as those who confess God's will be done on earth as it is in heaven?
[825.26 → 828.54] Not my will, but God's will be done.
[828.54 → 832.24] And then go on to ask another question.
[832.68 → 833.66] What is your throne?
[835.60 → 836.66] What is your throne?
[837.08 → 839.46] What is something that you can't seem to let go of?
[839.80 → 841.72] Something that you think is right,
[842.24 → 844.08] but seems to not go your way?
[845.98 → 847.48] We'll come back to this at the end.
[848.24 → 851.02] This narrative about Jonah and the repentant city of Nineveh
[851.02 → 854.10] is a portrayal of how we are called to trust in God's ways,
[854.36 → 856.98] that His judgment is the right one, not ours.
[856.98 → 860.48] And through the prophet Isaiah, we are reminded with these words.
[861.52 → 862.12] God says,
[862.64 → 864.70] For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
[865.14 → 868.46] neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord.
[869.18 → 871.18] As the heavens are higher than the earth,
[871.52 → 873.54] so are my ways higher than your ways,
[873.72 → 875.82] and my thoughts than your thoughts.
[878.20 → 882.66] Hence, the only response at this point from God to Jonah
[882.66 → 884.52] is a simple question.
[884.52 → 887.32] Jonah, is it right?
[887.86 → 890.06] Or more literally, again, going back to the Hebrew,
[890.44 → 892.98] Yates, To, that word means good.
[893.32 → 895.20] Literally translated here, you could say,
[895.62 → 898.74] Jonah, is it good for you to be angry?
[899.50 → 902.54] Now, I had this kind of angry tone representing God.
[902.84 → 904.36] I pictured in many different ways.
[904.76 → 906.40] Is it good for you to be angry, Jonah?
[906.54 → 909.82] Or, is it good, Jonah, to be angry at this point?
[909.82 → 912.96] I think the second one is better.
[913.46 → 914.74] But, whatever the case,
[915.14 → 916.04] what is the good?
[917.98 → 919.44] The better question, I think,
[919.96 → 921.36] we could ask, we should ask,
[921.72 → 922.98] who is the good?
[924.66 → 926.20] And, I don't know if you recall,
[926.56 → 928.28] somebody came to Jesus and called Jesus
[928.28 → 929.46] a good teacher.
[929.70 → 930.26] Good teacher.
[931.18 → 932.30] And then Jesus turns around,
[932.52 → 933.02] and He says,
[933.82 → 934.80] talking to me,
[935.36 → 936.74] why do you call me good?
[936.74 → 938.78] I hope you're intentional about this.
[939.40 → 940.48] Why do you call me good?
[941.30 → 943.28] Only God is good.
[946.00 → 947.70] God is good,
[947.94 → 950.04] and His ways are right and trustworthy.
[951.24 → 953.76] But, for us listening to this message,
[954.46 → 957.30] is it simply enough that we identify with Jonah
[957.30 → 958.70] and just feel guilty
[958.70 → 961.14] for being on our own thrones of judgment,
[961.86 → 963.12] reflecting our sinful natures?
[964.60 → 966.52] The answer, I think, yes.
[967.36 → 968.34] The message is,
[968.54 → 969.26] get off your throne.
[969.82 → 971.80] That is a necessary message for us.
[972.10 → 974.60] But, it is not guilt that is called for.
[975.58 → 977.46] What is called for is repentance,
[978.02 → 979.56] like Dave prayed for us
[979.56 → 980.82] as we were leading worship
[980.82 → 982.60] in our time of confession.
[983.84 → 986.04] Forgive us for trying to do things
[986.04 → 987.28] our own way
[987.28 → 989.00] instead of your way.
[990.16 → 991.82] Trying to do it our own way
[991.82 → 993.00] where fear and anxiety
[993.00 → 994.18] just ends up building
[994.18 → 996.44] because we're not trusting in God's ways,
[996.80 → 997.88] trying to do it on our own.
[1000.24 → 1001.74] Again, it is not guilt,
[1002.14 → 1003.96] but it is a call to repentance,
[1003.96 → 1005.64] which actually means,
[1005.78 → 1006.70] again, same idea,
[1006.94 → 1007.54] to turn,
[1007.54 → 1009.78] to turn to Christ,
[1010.60 → 1012.12] who is the ultimate fulfillment
[1012.12 → 1014.74] of God's merciful and just plans
[1014.74 → 1015.82] to bless the world.
[1016.62 → 1017.50] Jesus Christ,
[1017.82 → 1018.24] Yahweh,
[1018.36 → 1019.04] our Lord,
[1019.44 → 1020.00] our God,
[1020.06 → 1021.50] who came as an Israelite,
[1021.82 → 1023.00] came as a representative
[1023.00 → 1024.16] of Israel,
[1024.26 → 1024.84] like Jonah,
[1025.06 → 1026.68] to fulfill what they,
[1026.96 → 1028.26] what Israel failed to do,
[1028.60 → 1030.36] to be that blessing for all nations.
[1030.92 → 1033.18] And contrast Jonah to Jesus here.
[1033.52 → 1034.28] Unlike Jonah,
[1034.38 → 1035.56] who wanted death
[1035.56 → 1037.32] because he didn't even want
[1037.32 → 1038.12] to see that mercy
[1038.12 → 1039.40] being played out for Nineveh,
[1040.16 → 1043.26] Jesus exemplifies
[1043.26 → 1044.86] and embodies obedience
[1044.86 → 1046.12] and submission to God's will
[1046.12 → 1047.16] onto death.
[1048.12 → 1048.94] You see the difference?
[1049.80 → 1050.10] God,
[1050.66 → 1051.12] not God,
[1051.22 → 1052.80] Jonah just wants to die
[1052.80 → 1054.30] so that he doesn't have to see
[1054.30 → 1055.74] and witness the mercy
[1055.74 → 1056.58] being played out.
[1057.02 → 1057.86] Whereas Jesus
[1057.86 → 1060.08] is obedient all the way
[1060.08 → 1060.80] to death
[1060.80 → 1062.14] so that that blessing
[1062.14 → 1063.38] may happen for the world.
[1064.68 → 1065.62] In Mount Gethsemane,
[1065.72 → 1066.56] Jesus prays,
[1067.54 → 1067.76] Father,
[1067.86 → 1068.56] if you are willing,
[1069.20 → 1070.32] take this cup from me.
[1070.74 → 1071.60] It is too heavy.
[1072.14 → 1072.38] Yet,
[1073.00 → 1074.32] not my will,
[1075.20 → 1076.32] but yours be done.
[1079.40 → 1080.40] Yours be done.
[1080.68 → 1082.86] That example of obedience.
[1083.32 → 1084.96] And so this is the gospel.
[1085.60 → 1086.60] This is the good news,
[1086.68 → 1086.88] I think,
[1086.94 → 1087.62] for us this morning,
[1087.72 → 1087.88] hope.
[1088.52 → 1090.08] Through the obedience of Jesus,
[1090.80 → 1092.56] we now are gifted
[1092.56 → 1094.10] with the same blessing,
[1095.08 → 1096.48] equipped and empowered
[1096.48 → 1097.72] by his Holy Spirit
[1097.72 → 1099.02] to carry out the mission
[1099.02 → 1099.86] to bless the world.
[1100.66 → 1101.30] And remember
[1101.30 → 1103.76] that this is God's mission
[1103.76 → 1105.06] in the first place.
[1105.36 → 1107.24] It is God's will being done.
[1107.74 → 1109.38] It is not what we can do,
[1109.56 → 1110.90] not what we have to do,
[1111.06 → 1112.62] but it is the work of Christ
[1112.62 → 1114.34] in us and through us.
[1114.34 → 1117.98] And now going back to Jonah,
[1118.76 → 1119.58] even though,
[1119.90 → 1120.54] even when,
[1121.28 → 1122.68] because I know I do a lot too,
[1123.06 → 1124.78] even when we may feel like Jonah
[1124.78 → 1125.42] at times,
[1126.18 → 1127.90] angry with how God works
[1127.90 → 1129.60] or even reveals his plans,
[1131.02 → 1131.82] he, God,
[1132.20 → 1134.20] patiently waits for us as well,
[1134.62 → 1136.84] as he patiently waited for Jonah.
[1136.84 → 1139.92] The text doesn't say
[1139.92 → 1141.46] when Jonah got angry,
[1142.38 → 1144.16] and hopefully I have established
[1144.16 → 1145.68] that it is not right for him
[1145.68 → 1146.98] to be angry in this situation,
[1147.48 → 1148.70] but whatever the case,
[1149.46 → 1150.74] Jonah is downright furious
[1150.74 → 1152.02] at God's plans.
[1152.76 → 1153.78] God didn't turn around
[1153.78 → 1155.24] and zap him with a lightning bolt.
[1156.24 → 1156.78] He didn't say,
[1156.90 → 1157.10] Jonah,
[1157.56 → 1158.12] no,
[1158.52 → 1160.24] you have no right to be angry.
[1160.68 → 1161.50] You're in the wrong.
[1162.36 → 1164.50] He doesn't condemn him.
[1165.02 → 1166.90] He simply asks the question.
[1167.60 → 1168.96] And I think for the purpose of
[1168.96 → 1171.66] inducing Jonah into repentance,
[1172.16 → 1173.42] like a patient father,
[1174.00 → 1175.00] patient parent
[1175.00 → 1177.06] that goes to the child.
[1177.12 → 1178.58] I know I'm terrible at this too.
[1178.80 → 1180.72] Like when Joseph does something wrong,
[1180.76 → 1181.84] and I know this is wrong,
[1181.92 → 1183.02] he shouldn't be hitting his brother,
[1184.22 → 1186.50] but it's more effective
[1186.50 → 1187.58] as a parent,
[1187.66 → 1188.08] I think,
[1188.20 → 1189.08] and this is not from me,
[1189.12 → 1190.50] this is more from Moon,
[1190.58 → 1190.98] my wife,
[1190.98 → 1192.98] is not to just kind of
[1192.98 → 1195.18] point at his mistakes
[1195.18 → 1195.92] and his failures
[1195.92 → 1196.46] and say,
[1196.78 → 1197.08] Joseph,
[1197.32 → 1198.06] you are wrong.
[1198.66 → 1199.78] You have done something wrong.
[1199.88 → 1200.24] It is,
[1200.54 → 1200.82] Joseph,
[1201.36 → 1202.46] do you think it is good
[1202.46 → 1203.32] that you're hitting your brother?
[1204.22 → 1205.82] And have him reflect
[1205.82 → 1207.42] on what he has been doing wrong.
[1208.66 → 1209.74] And I think that's kind of
[1209.74 → 1211.96] what God is doing
[1211.96 → 1213.48] by asking Jonah the question.
[1213.96 → 1214.26] Jonah,
[1214.94 → 1216.08] is it good
[1216.08 → 1217.24] that you are angry?
[1217.74 → 1218.20] That's it.
[1220.98 → 1223.36] And so the encouragement
[1223.36 → 1225.14] for us
[1225.14 → 1226.30] is to trust and obey
[1226.30 → 1226.98] God's will
[1226.98 → 1228.18] and judgment for our lives.
[1228.68 → 1229.82] And throughout my life,
[1230.32 → 1231.94] as I have shared my faith journey
[1231.94 → 1233.26] in various ministries,
[1233.42 → 1234.22] I've been part of
[1234.22 → 1235.12] kids' ministries,
[1235.28 → 1235.84] youth ministries,
[1235.92 → 1236.72] for a long time,
[1236.76 → 1237.26] and now kind of
[1237.26 → 1237.98] with young adults,
[1238.38 → 1239.64] and talking to so many
[1239.64 → 1240.40] young Christians,
[1241.40 → 1242.90] a common theme
[1242.90 → 1243.78] usually runs
[1243.78 → 1244.24] throughout
[1244.24 → 1245.98] their discernment
[1245.98 → 1246.62] and their thoughts.
[1246.62 → 1249.40] many young Christians,
[1249.56 → 1249.96] I've found,
[1250.02 → 1250.72] are frustrated
[1250.72 → 1251.50] and angry
[1251.50 → 1252.62] for one,
[1253.30 → 1254.00] they don't know
[1254.00 → 1254.96] what God's will is,
[1255.58 → 1256.14] and two,
[1256.58 → 1257.40] even if they know,
[1258.24 → 1258.92] when something
[1258.92 → 1260.44] does not go their way,
[1260.98 → 1261.46] our way,
[1261.88 → 1263.18] they get angry
[1263.18 → 1263.90] and frustrated.
[1264.48 → 1265.12] And usually,
[1265.30 → 1265.90] in this case,
[1266.06 → 1266.96] if they are a Christian,
[1267.70 → 1269.02] they use God
[1269.02 → 1270.16] as the scapegoat
[1270.16 → 1271.36] for why
[1271.36 → 1272.44] they're angry
[1272.44 → 1273.40] and why things
[1273.40 → 1274.36] are not going their way.
[1274.36 → 1276.88] countless times,
[1276.96 → 1277.38] I've heard
[1277.38 → 1278.58] young Christians say,
[1279.02 → 1280.36] but I prayed about this.
[1281.04 → 1282.02] I've devoted my life
[1282.02 → 1282.98] and I've
[1282.98 → 1285.10] really thought deeply
[1285.10 → 1286.06] about God's plan
[1286.06 → 1286.68] for my life,
[1287.04 → 1287.94] but it just doesn't
[1287.94 → 1289.10] seem to go my way.
[1290.46 → 1291.26] How come God
[1291.26 → 1291.96] doesn't like me?
[1292.86 → 1293.50] How come God
[1293.50 → 1294.28] does not support
[1294.28 → 1295.56] what I'm trying to do
[1295.56 → 1296.90] to bless other people?
[1297.08 → 1298.04] I'm trying to do good here.
[1300.46 → 1301.94] I ponder the same questions,
[1302.04 → 1302.66] but from Jonah,
[1303.60 → 1304.34] take it from Jonah,
[1304.36 → 1304.60] Jonah.
[1305.42 → 1306.82] Anger has its place,
[1307.18 → 1308.80] but not if it replaces
[1308.80 → 1310.38] the trust that we have
[1310.38 → 1311.16] in our good
[1311.16 → 1312.44] and compassionate God.
[1314.26 → 1315.54] And so you could ask
[1315.54 → 1316.72] the question again here.
[1317.44 → 1319.18] When you're angry at God,
[1319.68 → 1320.04] stop,
[1320.16 → 1320.76] take a breather,
[1320.96 → 1321.54] and think,
[1321.96 → 1323.02] and question yourself.
[1323.78 → 1324.78] Who's on the throne
[1324.78 → 1325.70] in that situation?
[1326.58 → 1327.50] Is it God
[1327.50 → 1328.18] or is it you?
[1328.18 → 1328.20] Is it you?
[1328.20 → 1333.40] Human anger does not produce
[1333.40 → 1334.04] the righteousness
[1334.04 → 1335.34] that God desires.
[1336.66 → 1337.86] James 1.20
[1337.86 → 1341.74] Human anger does not produce
[1341.74 → 1342.36] the righteousness
[1342.36 → 1343.70] that God desires.
[1343.70 → 1346.36] And in the book
[1346.36 → 1347.00] that we are studying
[1347.00 → 1347.84] for our young adults,
[1348.72 → 1349.68] we're studying a book
[1349.68 → 1350.66] that reflects on
[1350.66 → 1351.42] the Lord's Prayer,
[1351.72 → 1352.38] and Daryl Johnson
[1352.38 → 1353.40] puts it like this.
[1354.52 → 1355.14] On the throne
[1355.14 → 1355.82] is the Father
[1355.82 → 1357.30] of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1357.44 → 1357.50] who,
[1358.16 → 1358.84] because of what
[1358.84 → 1360.12] he has done in Jesus,
[1360.48 → 1361.60] is our Father too.
[1362.56 → 1362.86] Who,
[1363.14 → 1363.70] says Jesus,
[1364.06 → 1365.20] knows what you need
[1365.20 → 1366.48] before you ask him.
[1367.26 → 1368.08] Text from Matthew.
[1368.08 → 1369.48] This is good news.
[1369.58 → 1370.40] This is the gospel.
[1370.80 → 1371.08] Why?
[1371.92 → 1373.96] Because we do not know
[1373.96 → 1374.80] what we need.
[1375.84 → 1377.48] We think we know.
[1377.96 → 1379.00] We think we see
[1379.00 → 1379.70] the whole picture.
[1379.98 → 1381.04] We think we recognize
[1381.04 → 1381.84] all the factors
[1381.84 → 1382.44] that are involved
[1382.44 → 1383.30] in our circumstances.
[1383.96 → 1385.38] We think we understand,
[1385.52 → 1386.48] even ourselves,
[1386.78 → 1387.72] our own desires,
[1387.84 → 1388.40] our longings,
[1388.44 → 1389.00] and our fears.
[1390.04 → 1392.16] But the stark reality is
[1392.16 → 1393.22] we do not.
[1394.38 → 1395.44] The good news
[1395.44 → 1396.50] comes from the fact
[1396.50 → 1397.68] that God does.
[1398.88 → 1400.48] God knows what's best,
[1401.10 → 1403.58] even if we may not see,
[1403.68 → 1405.12] if it may not seem like
[1405.12 → 1406.66] that's what we expect
[1406.66 → 1407.52] or even want.
[1409.58 → 1410.62] And so,
[1411.06 → 1412.68] from Jonah,
[1413.90 → 1414.90] we get to reflect
[1414.90 → 1416.88] when we have full trust
[1416.88 → 1418.10] in God's ways,
[1418.36 → 1419.10] in God's will
[1419.10 → 1420.08] and his judgment,
[1421.00 → 1421.94] we can turn around
[1421.94 → 1423.26] and we are able to hear
[1423.26 → 1424.34] and confess
[1424.34 → 1425.72] and to live
[1425.72 → 1427.90] according to Jesus' words
[1427.90 → 1428.72] that he taught us
[1428.72 → 1429.56] through the Lord's Prayer.
[1430.94 → 1431.42] Father,
[1431.90 → 1433.52] hallowed be thy name.
[1434.68 → 1435.88] Your will be done.
[1436.66 → 1438.22] Your will be done
[1438.22 → 1439.30] on earth,
[1439.70 → 1441.58] in our lives,
[1441.76 → 1443.14] in our daily lives,
[1443.14 → 1443.76] as we journey
[1443.76 → 1444.58] through our faith.
[1445.02 → 1446.54] May your will be done
[1446.54 → 1447.96] on earth in our lives
[1447.96 → 1448.92] as it is in heaven.
[1449.68 → 1451.00] Not my ways,
[1451.48 → 1452.36] your ways.
[1452.36 → 1453.72] And with Bruce,
[1453.76 → 1454.76] we can all shout together,
[1454.98 → 1456.54] I surrender to your will.
[1457.20 → 1458.00] And we can live
[1458.00 → 1459.70] according to God's will.
[1460.54 → 1461.02] Obviously,
[1461.16 → 1461.80] it's not easy.
[1461.80 → 1464.32] But the call
[1464.32 → 1466.04] from God's word
[1466.04 → 1466.52] this morning
[1466.52 → 1466.98] is
[1466.98 → 1469.40] trust in God's ways.
[1471.28 → 1472.00] Anger should not
[1472.00 → 1472.50] replace
[1472.50 → 1473.78] the trust you have
[1473.78 → 1474.80] in God's
[1474.80 → 1476.06] will
[1476.06 → 1476.90] and his judgment.
[1478.04 → 1479.36] He is on the throne.
[1480.04 → 1481.00] That is his
[1481.00 → 1481.82] rightful throne,
[1482.06 → 1482.82] not ours.
[1484.70 → 1485.48] Let's pray.
[1485.48 → 1485.52] Amen.
[1485.52 → 1485.56] Amen.
[1485.56 → 1485.60] Amen.
[1485.60 → 1485.62] Amen.
[1485.62 → 1485.64] Amen.
[1485.64 → 1485.68] Amen.
[1485.68 → 1485.72] Amen.
[1485.72 → 1485.74] Amen.
[1485.74 → 1485.76] Amen.
[1485.76 → 1485.78] Amen.
[1485.78 → 1485.82] Amen.
[1485.82 → 1485.84] Amen.
[1485.84 → 1485.86] Amen.
[1492.76 → 1493.98] welcoming Him
[1493.98 → 1494.62] loving,
[1495.06 → 1495.84] compassionate Father,
[1496.60 → 1498.04] slow to anger,
[1498.50 → 1499.36] abounding in love.
[1500.92 → 1501.34] Lord,
[1501.46 → 1502.54] we come before you
[1502.54 → 1503.62] in gratitude
[1503.62 → 1505.48] and in humility.
[1507.20 → 1508.92] For we have tried
[1508.92 → 1510.02] so hard to live
[1510.02 → 1511.88] as if we are
[1511.88 → 1512.52] on the throne,
[1512.94 → 1513.98] as if we are
[1513.98 → 1514.80] the rightful judge
[1514.80 → 1515.66] of our own lives.
[1517.32 → 1518.24] But Lord,
[1518.44 → 1519.86] we pray and ask
[1519.86 → 1521.24] that you would
[1521.24 → 1527.78] continue to guide us and to see that you are the rightful judge that we need you
[1527.78 → 1533.96] we need your wisdom we need to know your will in order to live the life that you
[1533.96 → 1541.22] have created us to live so I pray for that wisdom by enlightenment that we
[1541.22 → 1545.92] would be able to discern what your will is and also for that humble spirit that
[1545.92 → 1550.86] we need that we would acknowledge what your will is and to obey and submit to
[1550.86 → 1556.92] that will to that good and perfect will that you have designed for us so Lord
[1556.92 → 1563.10] be with us and guide us may we continue to follow your ways forgive us our
[1563.10 → 1568.68] shortcomings may we live to be a reflection of your kingdom to be a
[1568.68 → 1577.74] blessing for the world in your holy name we pray amen I invite you to stand as we
[1577.74 → 1581.12] sing our song response
