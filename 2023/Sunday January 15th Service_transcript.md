[0.00 --> 3.98]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[5.70 --> 10.04]  It's crazy to think that seven years ago, this day, by the way, seven years ago this
[10.04 --> 12.70]  day, we had our first service in the building, my first service.
[12.90 --> 15.06]  I didn't know anybody here except for Sid and Candy.
[16.06 --> 17.48]  And I just want to say it's been a privilege.
[18.10 --> 19.22]  It's been a good seven years.
[19.52 --> 23.36]  And even as I think about a sabbatical, I've never taken a sabbatical before, but I do
[23.36 --> 27.22]  pray that God uses that time to form me and deepen me and give me a clarity about how
[27.22 --> 31.10]  to serve well for the next seven years plus, Lord willing, here in this church.
[31.20 --> 31.76]  It's been a gift.
[33.34 --> 36.76]  As Brad just mentioned, we're going to start a new sermon series in the book of Jonah.
[37.82 --> 40.94]  And I'm excited to preach on Jonah because I've never preached on it before.
[41.32 --> 43.56]  I mean, I've read about it as a kid, but never preached on it before.
[43.98 --> 47.98]  And I hope that you experience what I've been experiencing in my study of it, and that is
[47.98 --> 49.16]  it is surprising.
[49.94 --> 51.70]  And it's actually quite challenging.
[52.56 --> 56.58]  And this morning, I'm going to overview and introduce Jonah, and then we're going to walk
[56.58 --> 58.22]  our way through it up until we get to Lent.
[58.36 --> 62.06]  But if you have your Bible, turn with me to Jonah chapter 1.
[62.14 --> 64.04]  We're going to read just the first three verses.
[68.30 --> 69.76]  This is Jonah chapter 1.
[69.76 --> 94.60]  Those three sentences set in motion the entire plot of the book.
[94.60 --> 100.30]  This past Tuesday, I was spending some time with dads in our church, and we were talking
[100.30 --> 104.28]  about children's Bibles, children's Bible stories, and which ones we're reading for our
[104.28 --> 106.56]  kids, and which ones work best for certain ages.
[107.06 --> 113.08]  And we got onto the conversation of that transition kids make at some point from reading these children's
[113.08 --> 115.14]  Bible stories to reading the actual Bible.
[115.88 --> 117.60]  Does any of you remember that transition?
[117.60 --> 122.30]  Because what often happens, if you remember it, is you start reading the actual Bible, and the first
[122.30 --> 129.92]  thing you think is, whoa, that story was not in my children's Bible, like Sodom and Gomorrah,
[130.56 --> 135.08]  and Songs of Solomon, and a whole bunch of other Old and New Testament books.
[135.96 --> 140.46]  But even when you do get to the stories that you're familiar with, you learn pretty quickly
[140.46 --> 146.20]  that they are not told in the same way, and often don't even have the same focus as we do in the
[146.20 --> 147.60]  children's books we grow up on.
[148.52 --> 152.76]  Best case scenario, when you read in the Bible the story you knew from a children's Bible,
[153.00 --> 156.64]  it deepens and strengthens that simplified version you grew up with.
[157.32 --> 163.06]  Worst case scenario, you just have to go out and unlearn all that you read in this cheesy,
[163.28 --> 165.26]  diluted version of a children's Bible.
[165.92 --> 169.42]  And I'm going to suggest to you that Jonah might bring us to a worst case scenario.
[171.06 --> 172.06]  Let me explain.
[172.06 --> 176.10]  If you grew up with children's Bibles, answer this question with me.
[176.24 --> 179.02]  What is the first word that comes to mind when I say Jonah?
[181.42 --> 181.78]  Unbelievable.
[184.10 --> 185.72]  We've got a lot of work to do this morning.
[186.82 --> 189.52]  So this week I googled children's Bible Jonah.
[189.62 --> 190.80]  This is what comes up, by the way.
[190.88 --> 191.90]  This is on my Google search.
[192.52 --> 194.14]  What shows up in all of these pictures?
[195.22 --> 197.14]  What doesn't show up in almost all of them?
[197.80 --> 198.74]  Nineveh, thank you.
[198.74 --> 204.14]  I think my favorite is the bottom left, where Jonah is like in full conversation with the whale.
[204.60 --> 208.58]  He is, you know, he's processed the trauma of being swallowed and spit up.
[208.80 --> 212.02]  He's become a whale whisperer, and they've just got a great thing going.
[212.54 --> 213.34]  And here's the problem.
[213.42 --> 214.02]  This is a problem.
[214.54 --> 216.54]  This is not what Jonah is about, okay?
[216.68 --> 217.82]  I've just done what I shouldn't do.
[217.86 --> 220.06]  I gave you a picture of the thing I don't want you to remember.
[220.06 --> 225.04]  Even when we did the images and the background with the banner and the Hope Art Collective,
[225.14 --> 226.52]  I said, I have one requirement.
[227.40 --> 228.60]  No whale.
[230.38 --> 233.20]  So now, take a look with me at the banners and the background.
[233.40 --> 235.10]  Thank you, Hope Art Collective and decor team.
[235.16 --> 235.54]  They're beautiful.
[236.44 --> 238.02]  What do you think Jonah might be about?
[240.10 --> 240.82]  The city.
[241.26 --> 241.56]  Yes.
[242.12 --> 247.66]  More specifically, it's about the compassion of our living God towards very wicked, broken cities.
[247.66 --> 250.98]  In fact, let me summarize for you what the Bible Project.
[251.12 --> 254.08]  They do these great overview videos on every book of the Bible.
[254.18 --> 255.66]  This is how they describe the book of Jonah.
[256.18 --> 263.76]  Jonah is a book about a rebellious prophet who is angry with God, who hates God for loving his enemies.
[263.86 --> 264.40]  I'll say it again.
[264.88 --> 269.64]  Jonah is a book about a rebellious prophet who hates God for loving his enemies.
[270.20 --> 274.62]  And we are going to unpack what it meant for God's people then and the church today
[274.62 --> 278.30]  to hear the powerful and, I think, challenging word of Jonah.
[280.06 --> 282.90]  Now, you need to know that Jonah, and you probably already do know this if you've read it,
[283.12 --> 284.40]  it's a pretty unique book.
[284.72 --> 286.64]  I'd even say it's a strange book.
[287.34 --> 289.68]  There's a lot of debate around Jonah.
[289.76 --> 291.60]  In fact, I feel like it's a minefield of debate.
[291.74 --> 293.76]  Like, a lot of scholars who study Jonah say,
[293.86 --> 296.10]  hey, can we trust that these events actually happen?
[296.10 --> 299.32]  Can people be swallowed by whales and then be regurgitated and live?
[299.66 --> 300.94]  Lots of questions around that.
[301.52 --> 304.10]  Lots of questions around how in the world it fits into the Bible.
[304.62 --> 306.18]  Specifically, the prophets.
[306.82 --> 310.42]  If you've ever read the minor prophets, which may very well be the most under-read
[310.42 --> 312.38]  and under-represented parts of the Bible,
[312.78 --> 314.94]  you'll know that this thing sticks out like a sore thumb.
[315.74 --> 318.34]  Most of the minor prophets are God's word coming to a prophet,
[318.54 --> 322.64]  and then the book records the prophet's words to Israel and to the other nations.
[323.26 --> 325.82]  Jonah is a book about that prophet.
[326.44 --> 330.32]  And even stranger is that it's actually not very kind to the prophet.
[330.42 --> 332.94]  It puts Jonah in a pretty negative light, as we're going to see.
[332.94 --> 337.30]  And that brings people to another big question about this book,
[337.36 --> 339.62]  and that is, what kind of book is it?
[340.38 --> 343.52]  You know, if you're a student of English and you pick up a book,
[343.60 --> 345.24]  one of the first questions you always want to ask is,
[345.58 --> 347.04]  what genre is this book?
[347.08 --> 347.80]  Am I reading poetry?
[347.96 --> 348.50]  Am I reading history?
[348.62 --> 349.08]  Am I reading this?
[349.14 --> 349.60]  Am I reading that?
[349.60 --> 355.24]  I agree with the authors who say that this book is satire.
[355.78 --> 358.30]  And there's a lot of backstory behind that, a lot of discussion.
[358.58 --> 359.20]  But let me explain.
[359.28 --> 362.04]  When I say satire, I mean, not that I'm saying this is not historical,
[362.40 --> 365.96]  but this book is written to get a response out of its readers.
[366.72 --> 370.12]  This book has all sorts of twists and turns and surprises.
[370.32 --> 372.66]  The good guys are the bad guys, and the bad guys are the good guys,
[372.70 --> 376.42]  and it's meant for the readers to say, whoa, why is it like this, right?
[376.86 --> 382.04]  In most Old Testament books, the Israelites, specifically the prophets,
[382.68 --> 386.82]  they are the good guys, and the bad guys are those other nations who are wicked.
[386.94 --> 389.18]  But in Jonah, it's a reversal, right?
[389.34 --> 392.56]  The prophet of God, the one who has the word of the Lord, he's running away.
[392.56 --> 396.10]  And it's the Ninevites and the men on the ship who hear this word about the Lord,
[396.20 --> 399.38]  and they respond with trust, with repentance, and with faith.
[399.84 --> 401.98]  And it's meant to say, hey, what's going on here?
[402.12 --> 405.06]  Why is everything reversed and upside down in Jonah?
[406.20 --> 408.32]  And we're going to ask that question in just a few minutes,
[408.36 --> 411.30]  because we need to know why this book is in the Bible.
[411.78 --> 413.46]  We'll put that on pause for just a moment.
[414.92 --> 418.48]  Now, when you get into a new book of the Bible, I find it helpful to know the structure.
[418.64 --> 421.10]  I don't know if you're like me, but I like to know how the book moves.
[421.10 --> 423.00]  Jonah has a very clear structure.
[423.08 --> 424.02]  It's got two halves.
[424.62 --> 428.12]  There's Jonah 1 and 2, Jonah 3 and 4, and they mirror each other.
[428.62 --> 432.72]  It starts with the word of the Lord coming to Jonah, go to Nineveh, preach against it.
[432.78 --> 433.56]  It's a wicked city.
[433.96 --> 438.30]  Jonah says, hard pass, runs as far as he can run, and then he encounters these sailors.
[438.50 --> 441.28]  There's a giant, there's a ship with a giant storm.
[441.78 --> 444.58]  Series of events that we'll look at next week, Jonah is thrown overboard.
[445.64 --> 447.40]  Swallowed, not by a whale, but great fish.
[447.60 --> 448.42]  Jonah never says whale.
[448.42 --> 451.84]  And in that whale belly, he has a prayer.
[452.12 --> 453.32]  We're going to look at that in two weeks.
[454.72 --> 456.72]  Then he gets spit up on the shore, and we get to scene two.
[456.80 --> 457.78]  It's almost like a reboot.
[458.22 --> 461.94]  God comes to him again a second time and says, Jonah, go to Nineveh.
[462.04 --> 467.56]  And this time, begrudgingly, he goes, preaches the world's shortest sermon of doom against Nineveh.
[467.84 --> 472.56]  And much to his surprise, all of Nineveh responds and repents, and they receive mercy.
[473.20 --> 476.38]  And I think everyone in the story is happy except Jonah.
[476.38 --> 476.46]  Jonah.
[477.08 --> 481.20]  And in the second prayer, which mirrors the first prayer in the belly of the great fish,
[481.66 --> 483.40]  Jonah actually gets angry with God.
[484.16 --> 490.18]  And the book abruptly ends with God asking a question of Jonah, a question that I think opens up the whole meaning of the book,
[490.54 --> 496.82]  where God says, am I not supposed to show compassion to a city that doesn't know what is right?
[496.82 --> 502.72]  Am I not to show compassion on a city that is not aware of how they are to live?
[503.38 --> 507.18]  It's a question that should percolate even in our hearts today as we live in our own cities.
[508.94 --> 510.38]  That's the story in a nutshell.
[510.88 --> 515.82]  And now I want to go back to the beginning and tease out a few more details of what's happening in the book overall.
[515.82 --> 518.76]  Verse 1 we read again,
[518.76 --> 521.14]  The word of the Lord came to Jonah, son of Amittai.
[521.54 --> 527.50]  Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it, for its wickedness has come up before me.
[528.42 --> 531.72]  But Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for Tarshish.
[531.72 --> 539.26]  Now, I'm told by people smarter than me that if you and I were the original hearers, we'd be like, that is interesting.
[540.18 --> 545.84]  That is unusual, even strange, because number one, you have a prophet of the Lord, who, by the way, was doing ministry.
[546.30 --> 547.64]  You can read about him in 2 Kings.
[547.74 --> 548.64]  He's an interesting figure.
[548.70 --> 549.16]  That is Jonah.
[549.68 --> 552.48]  And now the word of the Lord comes from him, and he doesn't respond positively.
[553.24 --> 554.34]  Jonah runs.
[554.90 --> 556.70]  The prophet is running from God.
[556.76 --> 558.38]  And not just a little bit, by the way.
[558.52 --> 560.04]  He's running as far as he can.
[560.04 --> 564.50]  And I'll throw a map up on the screen so you can just get a sense of how reactionary Jonah is.
[564.56 --> 565.32]  So here's Joppa.
[566.30 --> 569.10]  Nineveh is 550 miles, which is still quite a hike, by the way.
[569.46 --> 572.24]  But Tarshish, I mean, yeah, you're getting it now.
[572.32 --> 575.00]  The original readers would be laughing, like, what is he doing?
[575.36 --> 578.62]  Why is he going, to their understanding, the edge of the earth?
[579.16 --> 581.20]  You know, it's not like he's going from Surrey to Chilliwack.
[581.28 --> 582.72]  He's going from Surrey to Fort Nelson.
[583.44 --> 586.56]  He's going to the edge of the earth, and he really wants to get out of the way.
[586.78 --> 589.54]  And then you have to ask yourself an even more important question is,
[590.04 --> 593.08]  don't prophets know that you can't hide from God?
[593.52 --> 597.12]  Don't prophets know the Psalms, which say you can't run from him, you can't hide from him?
[597.16 --> 597.78]  He's everywhere.
[598.18 --> 602.08]  And yet Jonah, this prophet, he's making it to Tarshish.
[603.32 --> 604.50]  So it's a weird start.
[605.06 --> 607.50]  And any original hero, like, this is not like other prophets.
[607.64 --> 608.72]  This is not like other stories.
[608.88 --> 610.06]  What's going on here?
[610.06 --> 616.98]  And I want to ask a question that a lot of people, if you've grown up on children's Bibles, will think.
[617.54 --> 620.80]  Oftentimes Jonah is framed as a timid prophet, right?
[620.86 --> 624.10]  He's been given this very difficult task, and he's timid.
[624.66 --> 629.98]  And I have to say, I have some sympathy for Jonah because he is going to a very hostile environment.
[629.98 --> 635.06]  I mean, I was reading about Assyria, which is, Nineveh is the capital of Assyria.
[635.14 --> 639.54]  I was reading about Assyria and its war practices, and they're not known for being kind to the people they defeat.
[639.62 --> 640.64]  They don't just make them subjects.
[640.78 --> 641.46]  They don't make them slaves.
[641.78 --> 645.98]  They will torture, dismember, and they were known for skinning enemies alive.
[646.46 --> 646.62]  Okay?
[646.64 --> 647.56]  This is serious business.
[647.66 --> 651.94]  When God says, the wickedness of Assyria, of Nineveh, has reached him, it's been wicked.
[651.94 --> 655.86]  And you can imagine Jonah saying, well, no thank you.
[656.34 --> 658.98]  I prefer to keep the skin on my body, right?
[659.58 --> 660.44]  But here's the thing.
[661.70 --> 666.78]  The book of Jonah never tells us that the reason he goes to Tarshish and not Nineveh is because he's afraid.
[667.50 --> 670.10]  I would think there is fear there, but the book never says that.
[670.20 --> 673.70]  And I, you know, doing some reading this week and some trusted people that I've been reading,
[673.82 --> 678.02]  I actually agree that the reason Jonah goes to Tarshish is not fear.
[678.02 --> 683.94]  I also think that Jonah chapter 4 answers the why he does this.
[685.04 --> 686.56]  Jonah chapter 4, I think, surfaces his heart.
[686.62 --> 687.82]  We're going to come back to this in a few weeks.
[687.92 --> 691.12]  But in Jonah chapter 4, God shows mercy to Nineveh.
[691.58 --> 693.02]  Everyone's happy except for Jonah.
[693.14 --> 696.20]  And in a prayer, he has the guts to rebuke God.
[696.26 --> 697.20]  And this is my paraphrase.
[697.26 --> 699.18]  He says to God, I knew it.
[699.74 --> 702.26]  I knew you were going to show compassion on Nineveh.
[702.32 --> 703.68]  I just knew you were going to do that.
[703.88 --> 705.58]  So, Lord, I would rather die.
[705.80 --> 706.48]  Take my life.
[708.02 --> 710.32]  That's a pretty strange thing to say to God, don't you think?
[711.12 --> 714.04]  And I think Jonah is exposed in this moment.
[714.12 --> 718.18]  He's not some timid prophet who has a little bit of fear about going to Nineveh.
[718.76 --> 720.10]  He's an angry prophet.
[720.92 --> 722.68]  And he just hates the Ninevites.
[723.08 --> 727.54]  And it bothers him deeply that God would show them compassion.
[728.30 --> 730.84]  And Jonah just can't handle that.
[730.84 --> 735.18]  And so, he says to the Lord, I would rather die than be part of this great rescue project
[735.18 --> 737.76]  of redeeming and forgiving this pagan city.
[739.60 --> 741.58]  And we're going to come back to that in a few weeks.
[741.68 --> 744.70]  But I just find it very interesting that Jonah in this book is not the hero.
[745.34 --> 747.14]  He is not the hero.
[747.94 --> 751.50]  But this then brings us to the big question that we want to start this series with.
[751.50 --> 753.50]  Why is Jonah in the Bible?
[754.32 --> 755.78]  It's a good question to ask of every book in the Bible.
[755.90 --> 756.68]  Why is it there?
[757.04 --> 763.22]  Why is there a story about this angry, resentful, begrudging prophet who's mad at God for forgiving
[763.22 --> 763.78]  this city?
[763.90 --> 764.92]  What's going on here?
[765.48 --> 767.78]  And I'm going to borrow an image that I got from someone else this week.
[767.88 --> 771.24]  And that is, Jonah acts as a mirror.
[772.34 --> 772.48]  Okay?
[773.98 --> 776.66]  Jonah is a book that reads the reader.
[777.76 --> 780.66]  Let me give you an illustration that breaks down at certain points, but it will be helpful.
[780.66 --> 783.28]  Think of yourself listening to a joke from a friend.
[783.94 --> 787.84]  And you're following the details that friend tells a joke well, lots of clever turns and
[787.84 --> 790.48]  twists, and finally he gets to the punchline, and everybody's laughing.
[790.56 --> 791.00]  You're laughing.
[791.06 --> 794.10]  And then you realize, oh, that joke's about me.
[794.84 --> 796.28]  That's what Jonah's trying to do.
[796.68 --> 799.98]  As the Israelites read and hear this story, as they understand what's going on, all of a
[799.98 --> 803.34]  sudden it's like, oh, we are that prophet.
[804.12 --> 805.58]  And here's why I'm saying that.
[806.24 --> 810.34]  Israel had a very clear sense that they were a very special people.
[810.66 --> 813.82]  In fact, if you were here last Sunday, you'll know that 1 Peter quotes a passage in the
[813.82 --> 818.62]  Old Testament about them being a treasured possession, a holy nation, a royal priesthood.
[818.66 --> 821.48]  They had a sense of like, we belong to the living God.
[821.58 --> 823.74]  We're a special set-apart people.
[824.26 --> 825.68]  Jerusalem is a special place.
[825.86 --> 827.08]  Israel is a special nation.
[827.38 --> 832.62]  And over time, their view of the other nations was, well, we are here, you are there.
[832.62 --> 837.10]  And especially as some of those nations like Assyria started like going to war against Israel,
[837.30 --> 839.46]  they didn't just move from a sense of their superiority.
[839.92 --> 841.32]  They moved towards hate.
[842.12 --> 847.32]  And in so doing, they forgot the very reason God set them apart.
[847.90 --> 850.66]  Genesis 12, God calls Abraham, I'm going to make you a great nation.
[850.86 --> 851.82]  And what does he say next?
[852.52 --> 855.82]  Through you, all the nations are going to be blessed.
[856.32 --> 858.94]  It is not as though God loves Israel and hates all the nations.
[858.94 --> 862.38]  It's that through the people of Israel, his love will move to the nations.
[862.74 --> 869.12]  And here's Israel with a smug sense of national superiority, a smug sense of ethnic superiority,
[869.60 --> 874.20]  a smug sense of disdain and separation and hatred towards those nations.
[875.20 --> 877.96]  And Jonah represents them all.
[879.24 --> 886.22]  You might say that Jonah embodies all the worst tendencies of God's people, both then and now.
[886.22 --> 892.72]  Jonah represents that hatred of the person that you don't want to see forgiven,
[893.30 --> 897.24]  that person who's done vile things that you believe is not worthy of the grace that you've received.
[897.52 --> 900.80]  He represents the selfishness of believers.
[901.66 --> 906.04]  He represents the refusal to get involved in God's mission.
[907.08 --> 910.92]  He represents a sort of rebellious spirit towards God himself.
[910.92 --> 913.60]  Jonah is a mirror.
[914.80 --> 918.26]  And I believe that the more we allow Jonah to read us,
[918.52 --> 922.24]  the more we'll feel that punchline being about the church today.
[922.38 --> 926.74]  Because there's no shortage of examples of believers in their ordinary lives
[926.74 --> 932.88]  and Christians and churches not caring for the world,
[933.08 --> 936.92]  not caring for the city, not caring for the mission that God set us apart for.
[936.92 --> 942.28]  And Jonah's got a word for the church that we're going to unpack over the next number of weeks.
[944.66 --> 948.64]  What Jonah needs to learn is the character of God.
[949.60 --> 954.10]  In fact, I want to read for you a quote that comes from Tim Keller about Jonah's understanding of the Lord.
[954.18 --> 956.12]  I think this nails a centerpiece of Jonah.
[957.30 --> 957.86]  We read,
[958.52 --> 960.52]  Jonah wants a God of his own making.
[961.10 --> 962.78]  And I think, by the way, that is all of our tendencies.
[962.90 --> 964.82]  We want to form God into our own liking.
[964.82 --> 969.52]  He wants a God who simply smites the bad people, for instance, the wicked Ninevites,
[969.66 --> 973.40]  and blesses the good people, for instance, Jonah and his countrymen.
[974.00 --> 978.48]  When the real God, not Jonah's counterfeit, keeps showing up,
[978.88 --> 981.54]  Jonah is thrown into a fury of despair.
[982.38 --> 988.96]  How, Jonah asks, can God be merciful and forgiving to people who have done such violence and evil?
[990.12 --> 992.58]  And surely we can have a little bit of sympathy for that question.
[992.58 --> 997.50]  Jonah is wrestling with the kind of forgiveness that those wicked Ninevites can receive.
[997.50 --> 1006.14]  And what we need to realize is that Jonah and the church today need to recalibrate their hearts,
[1006.32 --> 1009.06]  their eyes, and their ears to who God really is.
[1009.92 --> 1012.54]  And what Jonah needs to realize is the God he worshiped,
[1012.74 --> 1016.98]  the God who set him apart as a prophet, is an enemy-loving God.
[1016.98 --> 1020.26]  Yes, sin has its consequences.
[1020.78 --> 1022.92]  Yes, wickedness will be dealt with by God.
[1023.04 --> 1027.76]  But his desire is for every city to repent, to believe, and find life.
[1028.40 --> 1031.94]  And Nineveh is just one small example of that.
[1032.20 --> 1036.30]  And Jonah's getting a front row seat about what the heart of God for the world is.
[1037.00 --> 1042.06]  And in my opinion, Jonah is just a small glimpse of what's coming when Jesus arrives.
[1042.06 --> 1044.90]  You know, Brad already prayed for this, but he said it so well.
[1044.96 --> 1047.22]  When Jesus arrives, he doesn't stay within Israel.
[1048.24 --> 1050.92]  Jesus' heart is the faultless heart for the world.
[1051.44 --> 1053.88]  If Jesus is truly a king, his heart is after every nation.
[1054.06 --> 1056.16]  And he goes from place to place, town to town,
[1056.40 --> 1061.96]  announcing and inviting repentance and faith and belief because the king of creation has come.
[1062.74 --> 1066.86]  Not just to Israel, but Samaria, Judea, and the ends of the earth, British Columbia.
[1066.86 --> 1076.94]  And it shouldn't surprise us that in Jesus' own ministry, he got pegged and accused and criticized for being a friend of sinners.
[1078.14 --> 1080.64]  That's the critique they got, he got from the Pharisees.
[1080.76 --> 1085.28]  This guy dines with tax collectors and he's a friend of sinners.
[1085.38 --> 1085.90]  You know why?
[1086.76 --> 1087.70]  He is God.
[1087.70 --> 1098.36]  And he embodies and lives and demonstrates the same enemy-loving heart of his father for the world that does not know how to live.
[1099.04 --> 1101.54]  For the Ninevites, us of our day.
[1102.92 --> 1108.00]  And Jonah could never have predicted the depth of God's heart in Jesus' ministry.
[1108.10 --> 1110.38]  It's not until we get to the cross, Jesus' death and resurrection,
[1110.38 --> 1116.56]  when we see how far God will go to exercise his enemy-loving will of grace.
[1117.70 --> 1123.76]  It's not until we get to the death and resurrection when we see how far he'll go to turn enemies into his children.
[1124.28 --> 1126.66]  Those who are destined for curse to receive his blessing.
[1127.02 --> 1130.64]  Those who deserve retribution and wrath, but they get forgiveness.
[1130.88 --> 1133.60]  And hope, let me say it as clearly as I can, we are those people.
[1134.40 --> 1138.28]  We are the Ninevites who in our own rebellion, in our own darkened hearts,
[1138.28 --> 1142.52]  do not deserve the grace and the affection that God in his love and mercy gave to us in Jesus.
[1143.76 --> 1145.02]  We are those Ninevites.
[1145.02 --> 1156.42]  And just like Israel, we are sent to bear witness and live out the enemy-loving heart of God in our city, our Nineveh.
[1158.94 --> 1161.06]  Now, I want to finish with just one way.
[1161.48 --> 1167.56]  It was very hard for me to limit this sermon, but I want to focus on one way in which Jonah is a mirror, I think, to Christians today.
[1167.56 --> 1172.62]  Not only did Jonah not think that Nineveh deserved the grace of God,
[1172.70 --> 1176.90]  and he had to sort of recalibrate the way he saw the living God, Jonah refused to be part of it.
[1178.10 --> 1179.50]  That's what these first few verses are.
[1179.58 --> 1180.70]  God's word comes to him.
[1180.94 --> 1182.90]  He hears that call to go to Nineveh, and he says,
[1183.22 --> 1184.54]  No way, God!
[1184.90 --> 1187.78]  He refuses to participate in God's mission.
[1187.78 --> 1191.86]  And it seems to me, I mean, this is my own way of reading this,
[1192.66 --> 1196.06]  that when Jonah hears God's invitation to preach to the Ninevites,
[1196.48 --> 1197.64]  what he's hearing is,
[1198.00 --> 1199.96]  Thanks for wrecking my life, God.
[1201.08 --> 1203.28]  I had a plan for my ministry as a prophet.
[1203.64 --> 1205.98]  I had a vision for what that was supposed to look like.
[1206.04 --> 1207.82]  And I'm guessing, based on the work of Tim Keller,
[1207.90 --> 1210.68]  that most prophets, they wanted to stay in Israel.
[1211.06 --> 1213.10]  They wanted to prophesy to their own kings.
[1213.10 --> 1216.30]  They wanted a sort of safe boundary around what they were supposed to do.
[1216.68 --> 1221.44]  And his vision did not include going 550 miles to the center of Assyria,
[1221.54 --> 1223.74]  their enemies, and preaching to that place.
[1223.82 --> 1225.00]  He had no desire.
[1225.76 --> 1226.64]  And in his mind, he's like,
[1226.72 --> 1227.26]  No way, Lord.
[1227.34 --> 1227.98]  I've got a vision.
[1228.12 --> 1228.76]  I've got a plan.
[1229.02 --> 1231.48]  This is what I want to do, and that isn't it.
[1232.02 --> 1233.60]  So off to Tarshish I go.
[1235.04 --> 1236.26]  Now, let me ask you this.
[1237.32 --> 1242.10]  Do we not do this all the time in our own lives?
[1243.72 --> 1244.46]  Think about it.
[1244.50 --> 1248.28]  Jesus' word goes out to the church week after week as we read our scriptures.
[1248.50 --> 1249.66]  His invitation is simply,
[1250.06 --> 1250.54]  Follow me.
[1251.92 --> 1253.10]  He leads by example.
[1253.24 --> 1254.44]  He teaches about the kingdom, and he says,
[1254.52 --> 1255.62]  Follow what I've shown you.
[1255.94 --> 1258.40]  And every single day, I would argue,
[1258.86 --> 1260.40]  in all sorts of ways, we say,
[1260.82 --> 1262.44]  No, thank you, Jesus.
[1262.90 --> 1264.42]  I've got a vision for my life.
[1264.48 --> 1266.38]  I've got a plan for what I want to do with my money,
[1266.62 --> 1269.76]  my relationships, my singleness, my sexuality, my work.
[1269.76 --> 1271.74]  All those things I have a plan for,
[1271.94 --> 1273.48]  and I don't want you meddling with them.
[1274.36 --> 1275.36]  And I really do think,
[1275.42 --> 1278.50]  if we're honest with what's going on in our hearts and our minds,
[1279.00 --> 1279.98]  when we hear those words,
[1280.10 --> 1281.70]  Follow me, we often could say,
[1282.10 --> 1284.34]  It kind of feels like Jesus is wrecking our lives.
[1285.28 --> 1287.90]  We're worried that he might ask us to do things we don't want to do.
[1287.94 --> 1289.34]  It's going to upset our comfort.
[1289.44 --> 1291.14]  It's going to derail us from what we want to do.
[1291.36 --> 1293.86]  It's going to interfere with the plans we have for our future.
[1294.08 --> 1295.00]  And guess what, church?
[1295.00 --> 1297.12]  You're absolutely right.
[1297.76 --> 1299.70]  You are absolutely right to think that,
[1299.78 --> 1302.22]  because Jesus, that's exactly what he's come to do.
[1303.02 --> 1304.74]  That's exactly what he wants to do with us.
[1304.78 --> 1305.72]  When he says, Follow me, he says,
[1305.92 --> 1307.22]  You can't be in charge.
[1307.32 --> 1307.82]  And guess what?
[1308.02 --> 1310.28]  When you are in charge, it goes sideways.
[1311.50 --> 1316.30]  Nineveh is a city that represents what happens when humans are in charge.
[1316.30 --> 1319.80]  And I would say there's a lot of examples in our own city
[1319.80 --> 1322.40]  of what happens when humans are in charge.
[1323.26 --> 1326.48]  And Jesus' word to the church to follow me is a word of release.
[1327.12 --> 1330.86]  Get out of the driver's seat and allow my vision for your life
[1330.86 --> 1333.30]  and my invitation for the years I've given you
[1333.30 --> 1336.42]  to direct your plans and your ambitions and your goals.
[1338.08 --> 1340.16]  I think Jonah 1 speaks to the church today,
[1340.46 --> 1341.90]  Stop running.
[1341.90 --> 1345.72]  Stop running from allowing Jesus Christ,
[1345.90 --> 1347.74]  your good, faithful Lord,
[1348.18 --> 1349.78]  to rule over your finances,
[1350.70 --> 1352.26]  to rule over your friendships,
[1352.82 --> 1355.94]  to rule over your marriage and your kids and your work.
[1356.44 --> 1357.32]  And for you to say,
[1357.66 --> 1359.12]  I'm willing to listen.
[1360.00 --> 1361.94]  I'm willing to give up my vision,
[1362.36 --> 1363.80]  my plans, my ambitions,
[1364.00 --> 1366.16]  and trust that what Jesus has in mind
[1366.16 --> 1369.46]  is better than what I have in mind for myself.
[1369.46 --> 1371.30]  And just to be clear,
[1371.36 --> 1372.00]  when I say better,
[1372.08 --> 1373.14]  I do not mean easier.
[1373.86 --> 1375.76]  I do not mean more financially free.
[1376.02 --> 1378.66]  I do not mean more comfortable or even healthier.
[1379.18 --> 1382.76]  But it will lead to the furthering of the kingdom of Jesus Christ.
[1383.58 --> 1385.00]  It will lead to blessing
[1385.00 --> 1386.94]  in the kingdom sense,
[1387.00 --> 1387.64]  in your family,
[1387.84 --> 1388.38]  your marriage,
[1388.48 --> 1388.98]  your neighborhood,
[1389.16 --> 1389.72]  and your city.
[1389.72 --> 1394.36]  And it requires saying,
[1394.52 --> 1394.76]  Lord,
[1394.88 --> 1397.94]  I'll receive your vision for my life,
[1398.22 --> 1399.74]  for our church.
[1400.30 --> 1401.98]  And I will sacrifice
[1401.98 --> 1404.26]  whatever it is I thought I wanted
[1404.26 --> 1406.70]  to trust that what you know is best.
[1407.42 --> 1408.80]  I trust that when I say,
[1409.08 --> 1409.76]  your will be done,
[1409.82 --> 1412.68]  it's better than my will be done.
[1412.68 --> 1415.44]  And don't be surprised,
[1415.70 --> 1417.46]  like we see in the book of Jonah,
[1417.52 --> 1418.40]  when it leads
[1418.40 --> 1420.60]  to the mercy and the power
[1420.60 --> 1421.90]  and the grace of God
[1421.90 --> 1426.00]  showing up in the most unlikely places.
[1427.90 --> 1428.70]  Follow me
[1428.70 --> 1430.58]  is the word for the church
[1430.58 --> 1431.78]  in Jonah 1.
[1432.78 --> 1433.68]  Let's pray together.
[1439.32 --> 1440.82]  Father, we begin with gratitude
[1440.82 --> 1442.00]  for this book of the Bible.
[1442.68 --> 1443.48]  And we thank you
[1443.48 --> 1445.12]  for the way you speak
[1445.12 --> 1447.18]  to your people then
[1447.18 --> 1448.48]  and to the church now
[1448.48 --> 1449.76]  through this scripture.
[1450.98 --> 1452.70]  We pray that we have the humility
[1452.70 --> 1454.08]  to hear what we need to hear,
[1454.66 --> 1455.88]  that you by your spirit
[1455.88 --> 1456.48]  would be gracious
[1456.48 --> 1458.46]  and expose what needs to be exposed.
[1458.94 --> 1459.44]  And Lord,
[1459.50 --> 1460.98]  in the areas where we resist,
[1462.14 --> 1464.06]  the areas where we run from your will
[1464.06 --> 1465.52]  and run from your invitation
[1465.52 --> 1467.36]  to participate in your work,
[1467.84 --> 1469.06]  we ask for repentance.
[1470.78 --> 1472.32]  We pray for willing,
[1472.32 --> 1472.82]  submissive,
[1472.82 --> 1474.96]  and humble hearts
[1474.96 --> 1477.02]  to follow the path
[1477.02 --> 1477.80]  that you lead in
[1477.80 --> 1479.68]  and to go to the places
[1479.68 --> 1480.64]  you send us.
[1481.72 --> 1483.10]  We offer up to you
[1483.10 --> 1483.78]  our lives,
[1484.54 --> 1485.88]  our time,
[1486.58 --> 1487.98]  our resources,
[1488.76 --> 1489.96]  our ambitions.
[1489.96 --> 1492.14]  and we ask that you,
[1492.36 --> 1493.34]  by your spirit,
[1494.24 --> 1495.44]  would make us ready
[1495.44 --> 1496.20]  to listen
[1496.20 --> 1497.38]  and follow.
[1499.00 --> 1500.38]  Yours be the kingdom.
[1501.48 --> 1502.54]  Your will be done
[1502.54 --> 1503.40]  in heaven
[1503.40 --> 1504.56]  and on earth
[1504.56 --> 1505.42]  as it is in heaven.
[1505.76 --> 1505.98]  Amen.
[1505.98 --> 1506.86]  Amen.
[1506.94 --> 1507.72]  Amen.
[1507.78 --> 1508.22]  Amen.
[1508.22 --> 1508.74]  Amen.

[1515.48 --> 1515.70]  Amen.
[1519.24 --> 1519.38]  Amen.
[1519.38 --> 1520.88]  Amen.
[1521.44 --> 1521.48]  Amen.
[1521.48 --> 1522.16]  Amen.
[1522.84 --> 1522.98]  Amen.
[1522.98 --> 1523.60]  Amen.
