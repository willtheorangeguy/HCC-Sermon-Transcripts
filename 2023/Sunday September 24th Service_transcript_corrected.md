[0.00 → 9.62] Good morning to all of you. It's good to be with you. Good to spend time together in God's
[9.62 → 19.58] Word and to realize that that good Word meets us where we live and where we are. We're continuing
[19.58 → 26.60] this series called Homegrown, and I'm privileged to talk about deepening your marriage. And
[26.60 → 30.62] you might say, okay, if you weren't here last week, what's the point of this series really all
[30.62 → 35.08] about here? And I thought Dave's quote last week was helpful with that, so I'm going to read it to
[35.08 → 41.82] you once more. This sort of highlights a little bit the purpose of this series, Homegrown. So we
[41.82 → 49.38] can see that quote up there, that'd be great. There we go, from James K. Smith. How can a home be a place
[49.38 → 58.18] to recalibrate our hearts? It means we should be concerned about the ethos of our households,
[58.76 → 65.24] the unspoken vibe carried in our time that is attuned to some end, some goal. We need to tune
[65.24 → 72.38] our homes and thus our hearts to sing His grace. That tuning requires intentionality with regard to
[72.38 → 79.40] the hum, the constant background noise generated by our routines and rhythms. You could have Bible
[79.40 → 84.46] inputs every day and yet still have a household whose frantic rhythms are humming along with the
[84.46 → 90.96] consumerist myth of productivity and consumption. You might have Bible verses on the walls in every
[90.96 → 96.84] room of the house and yet the unspoken rituals reinforce self-centredness rather than sacrifice.
[96.84 → 104.24] Each household and family does well to take an audit of its daily routines. What story is carried in
[104.24 → 110.84] those rhythms? What vision of the good life is carried in those practices? What sorts of people are
[110.84 → 119.82] made by immersion in these places? And I especially like that line, and maybe this is a challenge for
[119.82 → 127.26] the series, take an audit of your daily routines. What rhythms are you living out in your marriage,
[127.32 → 132.82] in your families, in your friendships? What does that rhythm look like and where is it getting you,
[133.44 → 140.00] really? This morning I'm going to jump into Ephesians chapter 5. Dave read a little piece of it. I'm
[140.00 → 144.22] going to read a little bit of a longer piece. So let's look at the passage we're going to kind of unpack for
[144.22 → 153.82] today. Ephesians 5 verses 21 through 32. And further, Paul says, submit to one another out of reverence
[153.82 → 160.50] for Christ. I love that start. For wives, this means submits your husband as to the Lord. For the
[160.50 → 165.16] husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body,
[165.28 → 170.26] the church. As the church submits to Christ, so you wives should submit your husbands in everything.
[170.26 → 176.96] For husbands, this means love your wife just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for
[176.96 → 182.02] her to make her holy and clean, washed by the cleansing of God's word. He did this to present
[182.02 → 187.42] her to himself as a glorious church without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish. Instead,
[187.76 → 193.02] she will be holy and without fault. In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as they love
[193.02 → 198.98] their own bodies. For a man who loves his wife actually shows love for himself. No one hates his own
[198.98 → 205.70] body but feeds and cares for it, just as Christ cares for the church. And we are members of his
[205.70 → 210.70] body. As Scripture says, the man leads his father and mother and is joined to his wife and the two
[210.70 → 214.96] are united into one. This is the great mystery, but it's an illustration of the way Christ and the
[214.96 → 220.74] church are one. So again, I say each man must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect
[220.74 → 237.38] her husband. Submit to one another. Mutual submission. I'm fascinated by Paul's intermingling
[237.38 → 243.94] of the church relationship, our relationship as church with each other and with God, and marriage,
[243.94 → 248.76] and how this is all about oneness. And what does that even look like? How does that go?
[250.08 → 253.84] So yeah, you know, love like Christ loves.
[255.84 → 261.92] That's no small challenge. Love like Christ loved. How? How did he love? He gave himself away.
[262.66 → 271.14] He lowered himself. He died for all of us. So submit out of that, submit to one another
[271.14 → 276.80] out of reverence to Christ. We read that, and we might go, well, there we go. No problem.
[277.00 → 282.84] We're all perfect at submission. No problem at all. We'll just do it, right?
[283.92 → 289.06] Verse 21, I think, could be called the power of marriage and relationships. Verse 21, right?
[289.14 → 297.00] Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. The power is submission. James 4, it says,
[297.00 → 302.26] submit yourselves therefore to God. And then out of that, you submit yourselves to one another
[302.26 → 310.72] for Christ. That is the gospel entering our relationships. That's what we're trying to figure
[310.72 → 317.78] out. That's how we're going to live if we're serious about this. It's interesting to me that
[317.78 → 323.02] the story of Scripture, the God story, the one we find ourselves in, that it starts, and it ends with a
[323.02 → 327.84] marriage. Adam and Eve in the beginning, right? God created them. Man and woman, He created them.
[328.10 → 332.52] And then this promise of new life that comes out of that, even beyond the brokenness that comes with
[332.52 → 338.34] sin. In the end of Scripture, it's time for a king and a queen to get married. I put it in here. We
[338.34 → 345.66] read out of Revelations, Revelations 21, the end of the story here. Then I saw, John writes, a new heaven
[345.66 → 350.60] and a new earth. For the old heaven and the old earth had disappeared, and the sea was also gone.
[350.60 → 356.46] And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, here we go, like a bride
[356.46 → 365.06] beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud shout, not that one, a loud shout from the
[365.06 → 370.90] throne saying, look, God's home is now among His people. He will live with them, and they will be His
[370.90 → 377.00] people, and God Himself will be with them. He'll wipe away every tear from their eyes. There'll be no more
[377.00 → 382.64] death or crying or sorrow or pain. And all these things are gone forever. And the one sitting on the
[382.64 → 390.24] throne says, look, I'm making everything new. So we find ourselves in that story in the beginning with
[390.24 → 396.42] a man and a woman. In the end, a marriage between Christ and the church. It's amazing to me that Paul
[396.42 → 403.68] brought those two together in this passage here. This is somehow about covenantal love.
[405.56 → 413.76] Covenantal love. A love built on a promise. Love is a strange word to talk about sometimes because
[413.76 → 419.68] we have some initial ideas about it. I think our tendency in a lot of times is to say love is a
[419.68 → 426.26] feeling. We feel we're in love. I love you because of the way you make me feel. And then it's conditional
[426.26 → 432.94] to those feelings. We're basically saying, I love you as long as that feeling lasts, as long as you
[432.94 → 443.06] make me happy. And I love you. This is so different from this covenantal love, this love with a promise.
[443.06 → 452.42] I've done lots and lots of weddings. I always kind of, when I have a couple of standing in front here,
[452.58 → 457.12] and they're looking at each other's eyes, and they're holding hands, and they look nervous. They
[457.12 → 463.42] look like deer in the headlights sometimes. And then I ask them to make, say, I do to these promises.
[463.82 → 468.84] And I'm thinking, are they actually hearing the promises? Because they're so nervous and everything
[468.84 → 474.20] else that day. But you know, we ought to, you know, look at those promises from now, from time to time,
[474.26 → 479.46] maybe on our anniversaries. But to have and hold from this day forward, richer or poorer.
[481.58 → 486.24] Let's take richer, right? In sickness and in health.
[489.58 → 495.02] There's some of you that know the sickness part. You're loving someone who's sick.
[495.02 → 499.38] And they need you.
[501.00 → 502.74] Especially see it in those who are aging.
[505.52 → 506.96] Or else it's a sickness
[506.96 → 509.28] that is within a family.
[509.44 → 511.34] Sometimes it's not just the sickness of the
[511.34 → 513.20] wife or the husband, but the sickness
[513.20 → 514.64] that is in the family.
[514.96 → 517.10] And you've got someone who's really, really ill
[517.10 → 518.86] or really, really broken somehow.
[519.42 → 521.20] And now that enters
[521.20 → 522.82] the marriage. It enters
[522.82 → 524.94] the family. And you have to
[524.94 → 526.80] live that out with that tension.
[527.18 → 528.78] Some of you know that firsthand.
[530.14 → 531.48] And it shapes you.
[532.02 → 533.56] And it shapes your marriage.
[535.92 → 536.76] To love
[536.76 → 538.96] and to cherish in all of that.
[539.04 → 540.80] In the richer or the poorer, in the sickness
[540.80 → 542.56] and health. To love and to cherish.
[542.66 → 544.74] How long? Till death do us
[544.74 → 545.30] part.
[546.52 → 547.78] Till this life is over.
[550.12 → 550.76] A lot of you might say,
[550.78 → 552.80] well, that sounds difficult. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. It is.
[553.78 → 554.28] It is.
[554.78 → 556.76] I love you beyond how
[556.76 → 557.62] I feel.
[559.28 → 560.92] I love you out of obedience
[560.92 → 562.88] to the Lord. Try saying
[562.88 → 564.92] that to your significant
[564.92 → 566.84] other. I'm only loving
[566.84 → 568.84] you because it's obedience, right? It's not going to
[568.84 → 570.56] go well in a fight, so don't try it then.
[570.94 → 572.54] But maybe think about it. Sometimes
[572.54 → 574.66] you love because you're obedient
[574.66 → 575.38] to the Lord.
[577.54 → 578.74] And you're not feeling
[578.74 → 580.78] it, but you love anyway.
[580.78 → 584.06] That is submitting
[584.06 → 584.98] to the Lord.
[587.26 → 588.40] I learned to put
[588.40 → 590.28] aside myself,
[590.58 → 591.22] my ego.
[592.68 → 594.34] I'm learning to do that
[594.34 → 595.84] because my natural tendency
[595.84 → 597.36] is to take care of me.
[597.64 → 598.62] And so I'm learning to love
[598.62 → 599.88] outside myself.
[600.48 → 601.10] And by the way,
[601.26 → 601.76] I can
[601.76 → 603.06] speak
[603.06 → 603.86] freely
[603.86 → 604.56] this morning
[604.56 → 604.84] because
[604.84 → 606.08] my wife's not here.
[606.08 → 607.04] she's in New Jersey.
[608.66 → 609.84] As long as you keep
[609.84 → 610.60] quiet about it,
[610.78 → 611.74] we're good, right?
[612.72 → 614.44] But any of you
[614.44 → 616.12] ever argue
[616.12 → 617.08] with your
[617.08 → 618.44] significant other?
[620.08 → 620.86] Just a few?
[621.46 → 621.74] Yeah.
[621.74 → 623.74] Some of you are nodding
[623.74 → 624.04] your heads
[624.04 → 625.36] and others are lying.
[629.30 → 630.18] My wife and I
[630.18 → 631.22] in our 47 years
[631.22 → 631.66] of marriage
[631.66 → 632.34] have had some
[632.34 → 635.16] pretty epic battles.
[636.48 → 637.22] Especially in the
[637.22 → 637.82] early years
[637.82 → 639.06] before we learned
[639.06 → 639.50] how to fight
[639.50 → 639.92] fairly,
[639.92 → 641.78] which is an
[641.78 → 642.76] ongoing quest.
[645.08 → 646.60] I learned
[646.60 → 648.04] early on
[648.04 → 649.12] that sarcasm
[649.12 → 649.96] isn't helpful
[649.96 → 653.04] but so satisfying.
[655.20 → 655.88] Sometimes.
[656.94 → 658.00] But still is not right.
[658.84 → 659.54] But so satisfying.
[660.54 → 661.82] But what we both
[661.82 → 662.36] learned
[662.36 → 663.80] and sometimes
[663.80 → 664.74] are still learning
[664.74 → 665.82] ever so slowly
[665.82 → 667.26] is that our
[667.26 → 667.88] arguments
[667.88 → 669.04] were often about
[669.04 → 669.86] our fears,
[670.44 → 671.66] about our anxieties,
[672.08 → 673.10] about our identities,
[673.32 → 674.04] especially our
[674.04 → 674.90] false identities
[674.90 → 675.90] that we have
[675.90 → 676.58] within ourselves,
[676.92 → 677.44] our hopes,
[677.80 → 678.48] and our
[678.48 → 680.44] unreached hopes.
[684.16 → 684.38] You know,
[684.54 → 686.28] life goes
[686.28 → 687.14] like life goes.
[687.28 → 687.38] You know,
[687.42 → 688.32] my wife was
[688.32 → 689.10] going to be a nurse
[689.10 → 690.68] and instead
[690.68 → 691.74] she married me.
[692.80 → 693.44] Now she's
[693.44 → 694.04] a full-time nurse
[694.04 → 694.60] but that's
[694.60 → 695.18] another question.
[696.28 → 696.74] But you know,
[696.92 → 698.06] she had some dreams.
[698.14 → 698.66] They didn't get
[698.66 → 700.08] fulfilled exactly
[700.08 → 700.60] and you know,
[700.66 → 701.72] so life twists
[701.72 → 702.22] and turns.
[702.34 → 702.76] It doesn't go
[702.76 → 703.26] always the way
[703.26 → 705.10] we think it will
[705.10 → 707.06] and that can be
[707.06 → 707.54] challenging.
[708.04 → 709.78] But the point being,
[709.86 → 710.60] my wife and I
[710.60 → 711.26] both brought
[711.26 → 712.82] into our marriage
[712.82 → 714.04] the brokenness
[714.04 → 715.16] of ourselves
[715.16 → 716.52] and the brokenness
[716.52 → 717.12] that comes
[717.12 → 717.90] from the origin
[717.90 → 719.10] families we grew
[719.10 → 719.72] up in.
[719.72 → 724.84] my wife grew up
[724.84 → 726.78] in an alcoholic
[726.78 → 727.34] family.
[728.96 → 729.54] Her mom
[729.54 → 731.46] died of cancer.
[731.58 → 732.16] Her dad ran
[732.16 → 732.54] off.
[734.04 → 734.84] And then she
[734.84 → 735.48] got adopted
[735.48 → 737.36] which was wonderful
[737.36 → 737.78] and lovely
[737.78 → 738.44] in many ways
[738.44 → 739.34] and had its own
[739.34 → 740.24] set of challenges
[740.24 → 740.96] as well
[740.96 → 742.58] and some expectations
[742.58 → 743.06] that were pretty
[743.06 → 743.78] hard to deal with.
[744.18 → 744.80] I grew up in a
[744.80 → 746.26] pretty healthy family
[746.26 → 746.84] although my dad
[746.84 → 747.72] was a rageaholic
[747.72 → 749.68] and caused a lot
[749.68 → 750.12] of pain
[750.12 → 752.78] to us at times.
[754.50 → 755.62] The arguments
[755.62 → 756.44] that we had
[756.44 → 757.28] with one another
[757.28 → 758.52] got fuelled
[758.52 → 759.74] by some of that
[759.74 → 760.28] stuff
[760.28 → 762.08] and we didn't
[762.08 → 762.72] see it.
[764.42 → 765.26] I want to be
[765.26 → 765.78] really honest
[765.78 → 766.20] with you.
[767.14 → 768.18] Most people
[768.18 → 768.80] don't know
[768.80 → 769.82] themselves very well.
[770.70 → 771.64] They only think
[771.64 → 772.08] they do.
[772.08 → 775.22] We don't often
[775.22 → 776.02] see how we're
[776.02 → 777.12] shaped by a lot
[777.12 → 777.66] of things.
[778.78 → 779.68] We just don't.
[781.00 → 781.74] Your spouse
[781.74 → 782.38] probably sees you
[782.38 → 782.82] a little clearer
[782.82 → 783.24] than you might
[783.24 → 783.70] see yourself
[783.70 → 784.64] often and other
[784.64 → 785.24] people as well.
[785.82 → 786.60] But here
[786.60 → 788.00] when Kenny
[788.00 → 788.46] and I had our
[788.46 → 788.86] arguments
[788.86 → 790.28] it was then
[790.28 → 791.52] I'm not just
[791.52 → 792.88] mad about that
[792.88 → 793.94] criticism you
[793.94 → 794.52] gave me
[794.52 → 795.84] but that pattern
[795.84 → 796.60] of criticism
[796.60 → 797.68] that bumps up
[797.68 → 798.54] against my own
[798.54 → 799.54] patterns of sin
[799.54 → 800.32] and boundedness
[800.32 → 801.48] and self-defensiveness
[801.48 → 802.72] and all that's
[802.72 → 803.52] going on.
[804.66 → 805.46] And it's not just
[805.46 → 806.22] this issue
[806.22 → 807.06] or this issue
[807.06 → 807.86] there's a whole
[807.86 → 809.14] dynamics at work
[809.14 → 810.12] here, and it can
[810.12 → 810.90] build up into a
[810.90 → 811.68] kind of habitual
[811.68 → 812.30] resentment
[812.30 → 813.38] if you don't
[813.38 → 814.24] deal with it.
[817.44 → 818.36] Maybe you feel
[818.36 → 818.64] that.
[819.82 → 820.30] And then
[820.30 → 821.54] one person
[821.54 → 822.68] frets out loud
[822.68 → 824.08] and he dismisses
[824.08 → 824.36] it
[824.36 → 825.90] and the other
[825.90 → 826.94] one fires back
[826.94 → 827.70] and then it's
[827.70 → 828.40] answered by a
[828.40 → 829.36] sarcastic remark
[829.36 → 830.44] and it escalates
[830.44 → 831.32] until then
[831.32 → 831.98] it ends up
[831.98 → 832.96] in a war
[832.96 → 834.22] of silence.
[836.22 → 837.04] Can you relate?
[838.48 → 838.84] You have your
[838.84 → 839.92] wars of silence?
[842.62 → 842.90] Lay
[842.90 → 843.66] up this side
[843.66 → 844.02] of the bed
[844.02 → 844.40] and this side
[844.40 → 844.80] of the bed
[844.80 → 845.40] back to back
[845.40 → 846.00] nobody's talking.
[848.14 → 849.06] And then the verse
[849.06 → 850.08] submit
[850.08 → 851.40] to one another.
[852.00 → 852.18] Whoa
[852.18 → 852.88] you mean
[852.88 → 854.36] I take the sword
[854.36 → 855.14] and I put it down
[855.14 → 855.66] in front of them
[855.66 → 856.78] and I admit
[856.78 → 857.52] I lost?
[857.76 → 858.74] Are you crazy?
[858.74 → 859.46] No!
[859.94 → 860.86] Submit to one
[860.86 → 861.80] another is an
[861.80 → 862.76] act of bravery.
[863.92 → 864.88] An act of
[864.88 → 865.86] obedience to the
[865.86 → 866.64] Lord out of
[866.64 → 867.46] reverence for
[867.46 → 868.00] Christ.
[868.48 → 869.18] And so I put
[869.18 → 869.76] down the sword
[869.76 → 870.52] because that's
[870.52 → 871.02] what Christ
[871.02 → 871.68] would have me
[871.68 → 872.12] do.
[877.74 → 878.48] Which is hard
[878.48 → 878.76] work.
[881.52 → 882.24] Which is hard
[882.24 → 882.46] work.
[882.46 → 884.72] I get along
[884.72 → 885.12] pretty well
[885.12 → 885.54] with people.
[887.26 → 887.90] When I do
[887.90 → 888.52] have conflict
[888.52 → 889.02] it's usually
[889.02 → 889.58] with the person
[889.58 → 890.12] I love most
[890.12 → 890.56] in the world
[890.56 → 891.00] and that's
[891.00 → 891.40] my wife.
[893.20 → 893.64] To love
[893.64 → 894.30] your neighbour
[894.30 → 895.60] is most often
[895.60 → 896.68] tested in the
[896.68 → 896.90] home.
[899.34 → 900.06] I can get
[900.06 → 900.80] caught up
[900.80 → 901.68] as a pastor
[901.68 → 903.72] in big thoughts
[903.72 → 904.78] about truth
[904.78 → 905.38] and grace
[905.38 → 906.12] and justice
[906.12 → 907.42] and I can
[907.42 → 908.26] neglect those
[908.26 → 909.14] who are closest
[909.14 → 909.70] to me.
[911.40 → 912.12] I need to
[912.12 → 912.88] remember that I
[912.88 → 913.54] cannot seek
[913.54 → 914.44] God's peace
[914.44 → 914.88] and mission
[914.88 → 915.34] in the world
[915.34 → 916.28] without beginning
[916.28 → 917.22] right where I
[917.22 → 918.64] am in my
[918.64 → 919.42] home with my
[919.42 → 920.34] wife of 47
[920.34 → 921.24] years.
[921.78 → 922.86] That's where I
[922.86 → 923.32] start.
[924.20 → 924.66] That's where I
[924.66 → 925.46] need to start.
[926.76 → 927.60] Submit to one
[927.60 → 928.74] another again
[928.74 → 929.66] and again
[929.66 → 930.50] and again
[930.50 → 931.48] but start with
[931.48 → 932.30] submitting yourself
[932.30 → 932.78] to the Lord
[932.78 → 933.20] first.
[937.12 → 937.82] Sometimes it's
[937.82 → 938.36] so easy to
[938.36 → 939.12] separate these
[939.12 → 939.84] big ideas
[939.84 → 940.52] of shalom
[940.52 → 941.08] from the
[941.08 → 941.88] ordinary lives
[941.88 → 943.12] we live.
[944.88 → 945.60] Let me share
[945.60 → 946.08] a quote with
[946.08 → 946.48] you that I
[946.48 → 947.62] read this
[947.62 → 948.12] past week
[948.12 → 949.00] that I
[949.00 → 949.56] rather liked.
[951.82 → 952.48] You'll see
[952.48 → 953.00] up there.
[955.74 → 956.54] Trish Harrison
[956.54 → 957.54] Warren says
[957.54 → 958.38] but the
[958.38 → 959.44] gospel reminds
[959.44 → 960.30] us that
[960.30 → 961.64] peace is
[961.64 → 962.64] homegrown.
[963.22 → 963.66] I like that
[963.66 → 964.16] there's our
[964.16 → 964.68] series in there
[964.68 → 964.86] too.
[965.28 → 965.84] It's homegrown
[965.84 → 966.54] beginning on
[966.54 → 967.20] the smallest
[967.20 → 968.34] scales in
[968.34 → 968.78] the daily
[968.78 → 969.86] grind in
[969.86 → 971.34] homes, in
[971.34 → 973.06] churches, and
[973.06 → 973.56] neighbourhoods.
[974.34 → 975.14] Daily habits
[975.14 → 975.84] of peace or
[975.84 → 976.40] habits of
[976.40 → 977.24] discord spill
[977.24 → 977.70] into our
[977.70 → 978.60] city creating
[978.60 → 979.64] cultures of
[979.64 → 980.46] peace or
[980.46 → 981.44] cultures of
[981.44 → 982.08] discord.
[982.82 → 983.48] I've been
[983.48 → 983.90] thinking about
[983.90 → 984.36] that quite a
[984.36 → 984.70] bit too.
[985.00 → 985.80] How much is
[985.80 → 986.48] our family
[986.48 → 987.92] dynamics spilling
[987.92 → 988.68] into the rest
[988.68 → 989.36] of our lives
[989.36 → 989.82] as well?
[990.18 → 990.62] Now we carry
[990.62 → 990.92] on with the
[990.92 → 991.10] quote.
[991.10 → 991.70] And God
[991.70 → 992.34] can then take
[992.34 → 993.06] these ordinary
[993.06 → 993.52] things.
[993.62 → 993.94] What ordinary
[993.94 → 994.12] things?
[994.32 → 994.94] Well, peacemaking,
[995.08 → 996.00] submission, grace
[996.00 → 996.46] giving, truth
[996.46 → 997.16] seeking, and
[997.16 → 998.18] like fish and
[998.18 → 999.22] bread, bless
[999.22 → 999.72] them and
[999.72 → 1000.40] multiply them.
[1000.64 → 1001.20] He can make
[1001.20 → 1003.02] revolution stories
[1003.02 → 1004.66] out of smallness.
[1005.02 → 1005.74] I like that.
[1007.94 → 1008.96] It's not the
[1008.96 → 1010.22] big things.
[1011.70 → 1012.64] Or else, the
[1012.64 → 1013.14] big things are
[1013.14 → 1013.66] made of a million
[1013.66 → 1014.22] little things.
[1017.22 → 1018.14] The gospel
[1018.14 → 1019.10] starts close.
[1019.10 → 1020.16] It starts
[1020.16 → 1020.50] here.
[1020.50 → 1020.52] It starts here.
[1021.46 → 1021.94] And then it
[1021.94 → 1022.92] goes down into
[1022.92 → 1023.76] our closest
[1023.76 → 1024.46] relationships.
[1025.12 → 1025.54] And then it
[1025.54 → 1026.08] goes up from
[1026.08 → 1026.34] there.
[1027.38 → 1027.74] I was thinking
[1027.74 → 1028.34] about that last
[1028.34 → 1028.88] week when Dave
[1028.88 → 1029.90] was commissioning
[1029.90 → 1030.44] the new elders
[1030.44 → 1031.04] and deacons,
[1031.14 → 1031.32] right?
[1031.64 → 1032.12] And out of
[1032.12 → 1033.12] Timothy, where
[1033.12 → 1035.16] Paul says, you
[1035.16 → 1036.42] know, that in
[1036.42 → 1037.12] order to be a
[1037.12 → 1038.02] good deacon or
[1038.02 → 1039.12] elder, you need
[1039.12 → 1039.74] to have it start
[1039.74 → 1040.34] at home.
[1041.58 → 1042.12] And it starts
[1042.12 → 1042.86] at home and
[1042.86 → 1043.90] then it can go
[1043.90 → 1044.26] elsewhere.
[1044.46 → 1044.90] It can go into
[1044.90 → 1045.44] the rest of the
[1045.44 → 1045.74] church.
[1045.74 → 1045.78] church.
[1046.48 → 1047.60] I need to
[1047.60 → 1048.62] seek peace with
[1048.62 → 1049.72] my wife before
[1049.72 → 1052.12] I start with the
[1052.12 → 1053.00] bigger world around
[1053.00 → 1053.26] me.
[1054.76 → 1055.46] And that's
[1055.46 → 1056.40] hard work.
[1056.64 → 1057.38] It's why both my
[1057.38 → 1058.24] wife and I have
[1058.24 → 1059.76] had a fair bit of
[1059.76 → 1060.50] counselling to deal
[1060.50 → 1061.10] with the brokenness
[1061.10 → 1061.76] we find within
[1061.76 → 1062.28] ourselves.
[1064.24 → 1064.90] You know, we
[1064.90 → 1065.90] both needed some
[1065.90 → 1066.22] help.
[1067.20 → 1068.46] And that led to
[1068.46 → 1069.70] some healing in
[1069.70 → 1070.38] our marriage and
[1070.38 → 1071.14] the struggles we
[1071.14 → 1073.18] were having in
[1073.18 → 1073.98] our life together.
[1073.98 → 1074.04] together.
[1074.56 → 1075.86] And all of that
[1075.86 → 1077.96] took intentionality
[1077.96 → 1078.64] and time.
[1079.00 → 1080.40] It doesn't just
[1080.40 → 1080.74] happen.
[1081.06 → 1081.78] You know, when
[1081.78 → 1082.30] Dave and Jonathan
[1082.30 → 1082.68] and I were talking
[1082.68 → 1083.62] about the series, we
[1083.62 → 1084.36] wanted it to be
[1084.36 → 1084.78] practical.
[1085.06 → 1085.74] The one big
[1085.74 → 1086.80] practical piece I
[1086.80 → 1087.78] want you to take
[1087.78 → 1088.76] home with you is
[1088.76 → 1089.64] that it takes
[1089.64 → 1090.92] intentionality and
[1090.92 → 1091.56] it takes time.
[1091.76 → 1093.00] It doesn't just
[1093.00 → 1093.28] happen.
[1093.46 → 1094.14] I don't care what
[1094.14 → 1094.94] relationships we're
[1094.94 → 1095.48] talking about.
[1096.88 → 1098.00] You need to
[1098.00 → 1098.60] schedule some
[1098.60 → 1098.94] time.
[1099.26 → 1100.36] You need to get
[1100.36 → 1100.94] some counselling
[1100.94 → 1101.46] possibly.
[1101.76 → 1102.92] You need to work
[1102.92 → 1103.92] on this deliberate
[1103.92 → 1106.58] you need to read a
[1106.58 → 1107.28] good book on the
[1107.28 → 1107.60] topic.
[1108.42 → 1109.44] You need to talk
[1109.44 → 1110.12] to a pastor.
[1110.44 → 1111.34] You need to talk
[1111.34 → 1112.14] to another couple.
[1112.40 → 1113.18] Whatever it might
[1113.18 → 1113.50] be.
[1113.86 → 1114.82] Call it a regular
[1114.82 → 1115.48] date night.
[1115.60 → 1117.12] Some people, that's
[1117.12 → 1117.76] an important way to
[1117.76 → 1117.98] do it.
[1118.26 → 1119.26] Especially in those
[1119.26 → 1120.76] busy, child-rearing,
[1120.92 → 1121.84] career-building,
[1122.22 → 1123.14] paying-for-mortgage
[1123.14 → 1124.00] kind of life that
[1124.00 → 1124.90] many of you live.
[1126.30 → 1127.44] There's hardly any
[1127.44 → 1127.78] time.
[1127.84 → 1128.60] I don't have time
[1128.60 → 1129.12] for all that.
[1129.12 → 1130.12] No, you can't
[1130.12 → 1131.24] afford to not
[1131.24 → 1132.42] take the time.
[1135.38 → 1135.96] When you're
[1135.96 → 1136.76] running hard like
[1136.76 → 1137.36] that, you need it
[1137.36 → 1137.90] all the more.
[1139.40 → 1140.34] Nothing is ever
[1140.34 → 1141.58] quite the way it's
[1141.58 → 1142.74] supposed to be.
[1142.96 → 1143.34] So if you're
[1143.34 → 1144.26] waiting for perfect
[1144.26 → 1145.06] to happen and then
[1145.06 → 1145.88] you'll do it, it
[1145.88 → 1146.82] ain't going to happen.
[1149.64 → 1150.42] You have to make
[1150.42 → 1150.74] time.
[1150.74 → 1153.88] And then we can
[1153.88 → 1155.94] move in understanding
[1155.94 → 1158.30] ourselves and our
[1158.30 → 1159.66] loved ones by submitting
[1159.66 → 1161.32] first to the Lord and
[1161.32 → 1162.04] then submitting to one
[1162.04 → 1162.36] another.
[1164.50 → 1165.82] Towards servant-heart
[1165.82 → 1166.50] development.
[1167.92 → 1169.28] And that leads to, I'm
[1169.28 → 1169.86] gonna just say three
[1169.86 → 1170.14] things.
[1170.24 → 1170.86] That servant-heart
[1170.86 → 1171.72] development leads to
[1171.72 → 1172.44] three things.
[1172.66 → 1173.52] To be like Christ.
[1173.62 → 1174.32] These three things.
[1174.90 → 1176.22] First, then you
[1176.22 → 1177.36] can hear criticism
[1177.36 → 1178.42] without being crushed.
[1178.42 → 1180.88] How many of you are
[1180.88 → 1181.58] good at hearing
[1181.58 → 1182.18] criticism?
[1184.72 → 1186.46] I rarely share what
[1186.46 → 1187.04] I'm going to do in a
[1187.04 → 1188.00] sermon with my wife
[1188.00 → 1188.98] because if she says
[1188.98 → 1190.04] something's wrong, I'm
[1190.04 → 1191.04] immediately annoyed.
[1193.08 → 1194.56] Which is kind of sad.
[1195.98 → 1196.18] Right?
[1196.68 → 1197.48] But okay.
[1198.12 → 1199.78] You know, I was
[1199.78 → 1200.90] overly sensitive often.
[1201.76 → 1202.26] I didn't take
[1202.26 → 1203.32] criticism very well.
[1203.68 → 1204.58] To my fault.
[1205.94 → 1207.32] So one of the
[1207.32 → 1208.28] healthy signs that the
[1208.28 → 1209.20] gospel is entering your
[1209.20 → 1210.30] life and your marriage
[1210.30 → 1211.52] and your heart, you can
[1211.52 → 1212.38] hear criticism without
[1212.38 → 1212.94] being crushed.
[1213.40 → 1214.30] Because oftentimes
[1214.30 → 1215.04] nobody's trying to
[1215.04 → 1215.44] crush you.
[1216.68 → 1218.12] The second point is, you
[1218.12 → 1219.24] can have the ability to
[1219.24 → 1220.66] give criticism without
[1220.66 → 1221.54] being crushing.
[1223.74 → 1225.34] Some of you are awful
[1225.34 → 1226.38] at giving criticism.
[1227.24 → 1228.14] Because you make it
[1228.14 → 1230.64] sound like there's all
[1230.64 → 1231.84] kinds of fault and
[1231.84 → 1232.74] blame to be given
[1232.74 → 1233.26] away there.
[1234.64 → 1235.26] And then the third
[1235.26 → 1236.34] thing, the ability to
[1236.34 → 1237.38] forgive without residual
[1237.38 → 1237.86] anger.
[1238.70 → 1240.10] Really actually letting
[1240.10 → 1240.60] it goes.
[1242.96 → 1244.26] That's easy to say, right?
[1244.30 → 1245.04] It's hard to do.
[1246.04 → 1247.24] We always say you don't
[1247.24 → 1249.10] keep score while we keep
[1249.10 → 1249.50] score.
[1250.56 → 1252.18] I think last time I gave
[1252.18 → 1252.90] in, it's your turn.
[1252.98 → 1253.54] I think, you know, that
[1253.54 → 1254.14] kind of thing.
[1254.38 → 1256.08] This is about giving
[1256.08 → 1257.84] yourself away.
[1258.16 → 1259.84] This is about growing up
[1259.84 → 1261.30] in Christ, which allows you
[1261.30 → 1262.94] to take the focus off
[1262.94 → 1263.86] yourself.
[1267.76 → 1269.08] And this only happens
[1269.08 → 1270.00] when the Spirit of God
[1270.00 → 1271.60] is illuminating your heart
[1271.60 → 1273.02] and you submit to it
[1273.02 → 1273.98] because you know that's
[1273.98 → 1275.42] where deep love lives.
[1275.52 → 1276.32] That's real life.
[1276.48 → 1277.50] Where you realize more
[1277.50 → 1279.20] and more what Jesus has
[1279.20 → 1281.02] done for you and is
[1281.02 → 1282.44] doing for you and it
[1282.44 → 1284.20] changes you, and it keeps
[1284.20 → 1285.76] changing you and nothing
[1285.76 → 1287.22] in the world matters more
[1287.22 → 1288.86] for you than that.
[1295.86 → 1297.02] And that's security.
[1298.06 → 1299.34] That's where real security
[1299.34 → 1299.68] lies.
[1302.18 → 1303.78] Ken and I often said,
[1304.14 → 1305.82] let's not make gods out
[1305.82 → 1306.84] of each other because we
[1306.84 → 1308.22] both make lousy gods.
[1308.22 → 1312.96] she knows I need God
[1312.96 → 1313.80] more than I need her.
[1317.28 → 1318.38] And that gives us the
[1318.38 → 1319.56] ability too then to submit
[1319.56 → 1320.58] to one another out of our
[1320.58 → 1321.46] reverence and love for
[1321.46 → 1321.80] Christ.
[1322.64 → 1324.48] You get this unselfishness
[1324.48 → 1325.96] as Christ becomes more
[1325.96 → 1326.86] real to you.
[1327.12 → 1328.22] And then criticism doesn't
[1328.22 → 1329.28] crush you because you know
[1329.28 → 1330.30] Christ loves you.
[1330.44 → 1331.24] And you learn to give
[1331.24 → 1332.38] criticism with love because
[1332.38 → 1333.02] that's what you're trying
[1333.02 → 1333.30] to love.
[1333.66 → 1334.62] And this will, servant
[1334.62 → 1335.72] heart mindset isn't just
[1335.72 → 1336.80] about a switch you turn on.
[1336.86 → 1337.78] You keep working at it.
[1337.78 → 1339.08] And it gets developed over
[1339.08 → 1340.32] time with great
[1340.32 → 1341.48] intentionality.
[1345.86 → 1346.78] So you get together.
[1346.96 → 1348.70] You make time to talk and
[1348.70 → 1350.20] to listen, to hear from the
[1350.20 → 1350.36] other.
[1350.44 → 1351.14] How are things going?
[1351.42 → 1352.54] Is there anything about me
[1352.54 → 1354.56] that's hard to deal with
[1354.56 → 1354.76] lately?
[1354.88 → 1355.84] Let's talk.
[1358.64 → 1359.72] I don't know how to change
[1359.72 → 1359.90] that.
[1359.98 → 1360.78] Well, let's work on that.
[1360.86 → 1361.74] Let's get counselling.
[1362.16 → 1363.60] Also to laugh together and
[1363.60 → 1364.50] enjoy together and cry
[1364.50 → 1365.44] together and pray together.
[1365.70 → 1366.78] I'm stunned sometimes.
[1366.78 → 1368.58] How many couples would find
[1368.58 → 1369.54] the hardest thing they could
[1369.54 → 1371.14] do is to actually pray
[1371.14 → 1371.70] together?
[1375.48 → 1375.92] Why?
[1383.24 → 1383.64] Why?
[1384.78 → 1385.70] And a little aside here,
[1385.76 → 1388.42] but dads, and maybe you do
[1388.42 → 1390.16] this so it's not relevant to
[1390.16 → 1390.36] you.
[1390.36 → 1393.82] Dads, help put the kids to bed.
[1396.82 → 1398.70] Some of my greatest memories
[1398.70 → 1400.84] of my kids and my grandkids as
[1400.84 → 1403.84] well is just laying on a bed
[1403.84 → 1406.34] with a book, reading stories,
[1407.28 → 1410.86] using stupid voices, and then
[1410.86 → 1412.32] praying with them and asking them
[1412.32 → 1413.50] how they're doing and all that
[1413.50 → 1413.80] stuff.
[1414.18 → 1416.16] Those are some of my best memories.
[1416.16 → 1418.08] Our greatest moments of
[1418.08 → 1419.46] meaning are hidden in the
[1419.46 → 1421.62] ordinary things we do in life.
[1425.50 → 1427.10] Candy and I are committed to
[1427.10 → 1429.08] helping each other become holy
[1429.08 → 1430.92] more than just happy.
[1430.92 → 1437.64] And we have tried, and we keep
[1437.64 → 1439.14] trying to work on what is broken
[1439.14 → 1440.16] in the way we pattern our
[1440.16 → 1440.42] living.
[1441.26 → 1442.76] And we remember it starts with
[1442.76 → 1444.66] submitting to Christ so that we
[1444.66 → 1445.74] can submit to each other.
[1446.20 → 1447.44] And then we just keep trying to
[1447.44 → 1449.10] learn to love like Jesus and keep
[1449.10 → 1450.08] learning to love like Jesus.
[1450.34 → 1451.72] And we're not inventing anything.
[1451.86 → 1452.76] We're imitating.
[1453.28 → 1454.90] And remember, your kids are
[1454.90 → 1455.52] watching you.
[1455.60 → 1457.04] What are you imitating?
[1457.04 → 1460.84] The patterns of this world are
[1460.84 → 1462.62] you imitating your Saviour's love
[1462.62 → 1463.10] for you.
[1468.10 → 1470.74] So get Christ's words into your
[1470.74 → 1472.08] life because you can't think like
[1472.08 → 1473.42] Jesus without knowing what Jesus
[1473.42 → 1473.90] said.
[1476.14 → 1477.38] That just doesn't happen.
[1481.20 → 1483.08] And then, and then his love
[1483.08 → 1484.76] penetrates your thoughts and then
[1484.76 → 1486.16] your actions through the power of
[1486.16 → 1486.68] the Holy Spirit.
[1487.64 → 1489.00] And like Jesus, you can say,
[1489.26 → 1491.04] Lord, not, not my will, not my
[1491.04 → 1492.96] will now, not my will, but your
[1492.96 → 1494.90] will be done in my life.
[1495.68 → 1496.84] And this will show up in your
[1496.84 → 1498.42] relationships, and it will be on
[1498.42 → 1499.56] display in the way you relate to
[1499.56 → 1499.82] others.
[1500.06 → 1501.92] And yes, it takes time, and it takes
[1501.92 → 1503.68] prayer, and it takes Bible reading
[1503.68 → 1505.40] and it takes coming to worship
[1505.40 → 1507.66] together as a couple time and time
[1507.66 → 1508.10] again.
[1508.22 → 1509.74] And it takes reflecting and
[1509.74 → 1511.10] meditating with other Christians.
[1511.22 → 1512.26] And that's why we encourage small
[1512.26 → 1512.56] groups.
[1513.04 → 1515.10] And as time goes on, it sinks in
[1515.10 → 1516.80] deeper and deeper and deeper and
[1516.80 → 1519.82] deeper because the gospel will dwell
[1519.82 → 1522.22] in you richly when you give it time
[1522.22 → 1523.56] and intentionality.
[1527.06 → 1529.24] And if this doesn't happen, your heart
[1529.24 → 1531.58] will stay hard, and it will stay small.
[1531.58 → 1537.40] And you'll naturally serve yourself
[1537.40 → 1538.26] first.
[1540.26 → 1541.98] We live in a culture that loves to
[1541.98 → 1544.76] talk about self-care, which is okay,
[1545.34 → 1546.82] but doesn't want to talk so much about
[1546.82 → 1549.78] submission, about dying to self.
[1549.78 → 1549.84] love.
[1550.60 → 1552.98] And that's what's needed in marriage,
[1553.26 → 1557.04] for you to give yourself away.
[1559.90 → 1563.34] And to enter a covenantal love, a promise
[1563.34 → 1566.48] to love, not just when it feels good, but
[1566.48 → 1568.74] to live it even when you don't feel it.
[1568.74 → 1573.66] And that's what love does.
[1573.66 → 1576.38] You listen, you serve, you share, you
[1576.38 → 1578.70] repent, you forgive, you create time
[1578.70 → 1579.28] and space.
[1579.90 → 1581.74] That love gets you to, and that love
[1581.74 → 1583.54] will get you through the inevitable
[1583.54 → 1584.66] hard times.
[1590.12 → 1592.22] I talk to too many people where trust
[1592.22 → 1595.48] has been hurt, where laziness has set in.
[1595.48 → 1598.96] And I want to push them towards this.
[1601.68 → 1603.14] And it's not a quick fix.
[1604.50 → 1607.22] It's a lifelong rearranging of what
[1607.22 → 1608.48] matters most to you.
[1612.42 → 1613.72] We're an impatient people.
[1614.76 → 1617.86] We hate waiting, even as God is at
[1617.86 → 1619.48] work in that waiting through our lives
[1619.48 → 1620.04] and relationships.
[1620.56 → 1622.26] We want to say, I just want to get on
[1622.26 → 1622.52] with it.
[1622.58 → 1624.04] Come on, God, work with me.
[1625.48 → 1626.82] I'm tired of waiting.
[1627.92 → 1629.42] And yet it's sometimes in that waiting
[1629.42 → 1630.74] and that working at it and that
[1630.74 → 1632.56] intentionality that God does his
[1632.56 → 1633.32] the greatest work.
[1633.86 → 1635.72] And then Christians are marked not only
[1635.72 → 1637.88] by patience and carrying on then, but
[1637.88 → 1638.90] also by longing.
[1639.78 → 1643.00] We are oriented to our future hopes.
[1643.20 → 1646.28] As couples, we have dreams and hopes for
[1646.28 → 1647.68] our kids, for ourselves, for our
[1647.68 → 1648.06] retirement.
[1648.28 → 1648.88] All fine.
[1648.96 → 1649.42] All good.
[1649.72 → 1649.92] Good.
[1649.98 → 1651.42] We should have some dreams.
[1651.42 → 1651.48] dreams.
[1651.98 → 1656.84] But we should also not dream to escape.
[1657.98 → 1660.06] Not dream to say, oh man, someday when I
[1660.06 → 1662.48] retire, then this job's done, and I can
[1662.48 → 1664.82] finally be happy and all that kind of
[1664.82 → 1664.90] stuff.
[1665.08 → 1665.98] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1666.16 → 1668.68] At the moment, God is with you in this
[1668.68 → 1669.00] moment.
[1669.20 → 1670.80] This moment is life.
[1672.40 → 1674.00] Don't wait for life.
[1674.00 → 1677.88] And yeah, we have to deal with the real
[1677.88 → 1679.48] and pressing brokenness and suffering in
[1679.48 → 1679.82] the world.
[1680.02 → 1681.56] We don't get a pass on that.
[1682.70 → 1683.76] It's hard sometimes.
[1684.80 → 1686.86] The future we hope for, the one that God
[1686.86 → 1689.38] is unfolding before us right now, the
[1689.38 → 1692.00] story of Scripture is that where there
[1692.00 → 1693.88] will be no more tears and no more mourning
[1693.88 → 1695.74] and no more death and when justice will
[1695.74 → 1698.68] roll like a river, that one hangs right
[1698.68 → 1701.16] now over our relationships, our marriages,
[1701.30 → 1702.82] our kids, over everything.
[1702.82 → 1705.52] That's there, right here.
[1708.70 → 1711.06] It gives us a vision of what to work for
[1711.06 → 1713.20] in the here and now as we continue to
[1713.20 → 1714.82] pray, Lord, thy kingdom come.
[1715.08 → 1716.48] Thy kingdom come into me.
[1716.76 → 1718.22] Thy kingdom come into my marriage.
[1718.46 → 1719.84] Thy kingdom come into my kids.
[1720.14 → 1721.88] Thy kingdom come into our church, even
[1721.88 → 1722.50] when it's hard.
[1722.78 → 1725.50] Thy kingdom come into all these moments
[1725.50 → 1727.88] because the promise of God's eternal
[1727.88 → 1729.86] future is always before us.
[1732.82 → 1739.12] The world can be a hard place.
[1742.06 → 1743.88] But life in Christ with the power of the
[1743.88 → 1746.16] Holy Spirit allows us to glimpse the
[1746.16 → 1748.74] potential redemption, and we get to
[1748.74 → 1749.66] participate in it.
[1750.70 → 1752.44] We get to submit to it.
[1752.44 → 1755.70] And our hope for the future, Shalom,
[1755.84 → 1758.78] motivates us to press toward that reality
[1758.78 → 1761.90] in our ordinary day-to-day lives.
[1762.26 → 1764.18] You don't have to just wait until you drop dead.
[1766.86 → 1769.12] And we trust the Lord because He is preparing
[1769.12 → 1769.88] a place for us.
[1770.54 → 1771.64] And He is the Lord.
[1772.36 → 1773.46] And He is our Saviour.
[1773.46 → 1778.94] May His strength fill you and use you to be the
[1778.94 → 1779.94] blessing you need to be.
[1780.82 → 1781.42] Let's pray.
[1785.42 → 1787.92] Lord God, we come before you and we just
[1787.92 → 1789.78] thank you, Lord, for your incredible love for us.
[1791.76 → 1794.84] Lord, we live in a broken and a messy world.
[1795.24 → 1796.40] We make it messy too.
[1797.42 → 1798.30] Forgive us for that.
[1798.30 → 1801.40] And help us, Lord, to keep our eyes focused on you.
[1802.30 → 1804.08] Focused on the way you want us to live.
[1804.18 → 1805.50] Submitting our lives to you.
[1805.62 → 1806.92] Submitting our marriages to you.
[1807.00 → 1807.50] Our friendships.
[1808.18 → 1809.70] Our everything to you.
[1810.46 → 1811.84] So that we don't get in the way.
[1812.90 → 1815.18] Father, will you bless us with your spirit,
[1815.32 → 1815.96] with your strength.
[1816.30 → 1819.00] May we get your words into our heads and hearts
[1819.00 → 1820.18] and minds and lives.
[1821.48 → 1822.24] Will you fill us?
[1822.50 → 1823.70] We pray this in the name of Jesus.
[1824.38 → 1824.66] Amen.
[1824.66 → 1824.76] Amen.
