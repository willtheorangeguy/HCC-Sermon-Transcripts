[0.00 --> 6.56]  Candy, I just want to say thank you for praying for the local churches.
[6.56 --> 10.08]  I had two experiences this week where I was spending time with pastors,
[10.70 --> 13.98]  praying with them or praying with them for Trinity Western students,
[14.06 --> 17.00]  and I'm reminded of how what we do here is just part of a much bigger thing
[17.00 --> 18.88]  that God is doing in many churches around our city,
[19.38 --> 22.82]  and we want to be part of that wider body of Christ being faithful to the gospel.
[24.30 --> 28.18]  We are finishing our series that we've been working out for the last four weeks
[28.18 --> 29.16]  called Your Story.
[29.46 --> 32.46]  We've looked at the gospel, the events of Jesus' death and resurrection,
[32.88 --> 36.14]  and how they fulfill the unfolding story of the Bible.
[36.98 --> 39.04]  And last week we looked at how there's actually a different story
[39.04 --> 42.20]  that's gripping and seeking to control our hearts and minds,
[42.28 --> 43.56]  and that is the story of our culture.
[44.30 --> 47.68]  And this morning what we want to look at is what is the calling of the church
[47.68 --> 51.34]  as we live at the crossroads of the biblical story and the cultural story,
[51.44 --> 53.42]  what is it that Jesus invites us to do
[53.42 --> 56.70]  and how to live the rest of our lives as his disciples.
[56.70 --> 60.08]  And for that, we're actually going to look at a very well-known passage
[60.08 --> 61.08]  if you grew up in the church.
[61.36 --> 64.48]  It's from Matthew 28, and it's called The Great Commission.
[64.64 --> 66.74]  So if you have your Bible, turn with me to Matthew 28,
[67.12 --> 69.68]  and we'll read 16 all the way to 20.
[69.68 --> 76.58]  Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee,
[76.98 --> 79.18]  to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
[80.18 --> 83.32]  When they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted.
[83.32 --> 85.78]  Then Jesus came to them and said,
[86.54 --> 90.44]  All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[91.26 --> 94.36]  Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,
[94.82 --> 98.70]  baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[99.12 --> 102.36]  and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[102.98 --> 107.04]  And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.
[107.04 --> 107.12]  Amen.
[113.32 --> 116.06]  And when Brittany and I got married some 16 years ago,
[116.70 --> 119.98]  we had a professor of ours give us a gift for our wedding.
[120.52 --> 122.84]  And I'll show you a picture of the gift he gave us.
[123.70 --> 125.00]  He gave us a piece of art.
[125.50 --> 128.08]  And it wasn't on the registry, and I'm just going to be straight up.
[128.14 --> 130.62]  When I got this piece of art, which is in our house, it's very big,
[130.66 --> 131.78]  I was like, what is this?
[132.36 --> 134.22]  It's not my style, it's black and white.
[134.32 --> 136.98]  And I didn't even understand exactly what was behind the gift
[136.98 --> 138.70]  until I looked a little more closely.
[138.70 --> 143.68]  And I want us to take a moment to look at what might just be unique about this art.
[144.10 --> 146.56]  I realize if you're sitting in the back, you might not be able to see it as clearly.
[146.68 --> 150.90]  But if you look closely, you will see that down the center aisle of the sanctuary,
[151.02 --> 151.40]  what is that?
[151.44 --> 151.86]  Can you see it?
[153.28 --> 154.18]  It's a city street.
[154.98 --> 158.88]  The artist very creatively superimposed an ordinary, busy city street
[158.88 --> 159.96]  right down the center of the aisle.
[160.52 --> 163.38]  And it's dark, but if you look at the top left corner,
[163.48 --> 166.78]  there's a banner hanging, and on that banner is Matthew 28.
[166.78 --> 173.28]  Go make disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[173.76 --> 175.30]  And I'm no art critic, clearly.
[175.46 --> 176.94]  When I got the piece of art, I didn't like it.
[177.36 --> 180.78]  But it seems to me that the artist is inviting a really important question.
[181.46 --> 185.00]  The question is, what is it that they do in this sanctuary building
[185.00 --> 188.76]  that has to intersect with the ordinary, busy life of the city?
[189.42 --> 192.68]  What does those words of the Great Commission to make disciples
[192.68 --> 196.26]  have to do with ordinary lives of people?
[197.06 --> 199.22]  Or to frame it around the story of the series,
[199.56 --> 203.88]  what does the story of the church have to do with the story of the neighborhood?
[204.96 --> 207.50]  And to this day, this piece of art is hanging in our house,
[207.80 --> 210.28]  and people who walk by it, I'll ask them to do the examination.
[210.52 --> 211.42]  What is this all about?
[213.06 --> 215.76]  This morning, we're going to be looking at the calling of the church
[215.76 --> 218.68]  in the middle of the city to bear witness to Jesus.
[218.68 --> 223.72]  Now, here's a realization that I have seen many people have
[223.72 --> 227.44]  as I'll teach on the story of the Bible or preach on the story of the Bible.
[227.70 --> 231.12]  The realization often happens to people at different times where it hits them
[231.12 --> 233.32]  that they, this might sound basic, but it's so significant,
[233.84 --> 238.96]  they realize that they have a part to play in the story of the Bible.
[239.78 --> 243.48]  They realize that if we are part of the church, the story's not finished yet,
[243.48 --> 246.48]  and the story of the Bible actually takes us up into the narrative,
[246.62 --> 250.92]  and it gives us a part of the plot to play as people who follow Jesus.
[251.68 --> 254.08]  If you were here two weeks ago and Jonathan preached on the story,
[254.40 --> 256.88]  we know the story begins with a good creation,
[257.04 --> 261.78]  that our triune Father places us in the world to enjoy, cultivate, and develop.
[262.16 --> 265.60]  We know the story ends with a healed, renewed creation,
[265.68 --> 269.16]  where we, with resurrected bodies, get to enjoy forever again.
[269.16 --> 272.60]  And we know in the middle of the story is Jesus' death and resurrection,
[273.06 --> 277.38]  where he deals decisively with the power of sin and Satan and death.
[277.68 --> 282.76]  What we often miss is where Jesus, right before his ascension,
[283.26 --> 285.42]  says to his disciples, which includes the church today,
[285.88 --> 288.64]  I have a job for you.
[289.72 --> 292.98]  You have work to do for me.
[292.98 --> 299.04]  And I'm now sending you to be my witnesses to the ends of the earth.
[299.12 --> 300.98]  And by the way, I say this almost every time,
[301.34 --> 303.68]  but you should know that British Columbia, to people who receive this,
[303.86 --> 304.90]  we are the ends of the earth.
[305.46 --> 308.28]  So in some sense, we bear witness to how true this has been,
[308.86 --> 311.34]  that the church has been making disciples to the ends of the earth.
[312.76 --> 314.74]  That's what this passage of Matthew is about.
[315.50 --> 317.64]  And you should know, by the way, when we read those words,
[317.70 --> 320.64]  if you don't have your own Bible, those were the last words of Matthew.
[320.64 --> 324.96]  These are Jesus' last words to his disciples before he ascends to the Father
[324.96 --> 329.22]  to take up his rule, and he doesn't waste his last words with them.
[329.42 --> 331.06]  This is often called the Great Commission,
[331.54 --> 334.28]  the missionary sending verse for all Christians into the world.
[335.30 --> 339.62]  But let's just notice the audacious way Jesus starts the Great Commission.
[340.26 --> 341.80]  It starts, by the way, just the movement of it.
[341.84 --> 346.04]  Jesus names his authority, and then he gives a command to the church,
[346.44 --> 347.88]  and then he talks about his presence.
[347.88 --> 351.02]  It's Jesus' authority, Jesus' command, Jesus' presence.
[351.50 --> 353.68]  But Jesus starts, I think, with an audacious claim.
[353.76 --> 357.22]  It's either he's crazy, or we have to listen and take seriously what he says.
[357.74 --> 364.34]  All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[366.10 --> 367.88]  Well, that statement doesn't get any larger than that.
[367.98 --> 369.22]  Basically, what Jesus is saying is,
[369.46 --> 372.52]  whoever or whatever you thought had power and authority
[372.52 --> 377.64]  before Jesus showed up is now subservient and below and underneath Jesus.
[378.14 --> 381.54]  Nation states, political leaders, kingdoms, armies,
[381.70 --> 384.58]  all of that, no matter where it is in the world or if it's in heaven,
[384.86 --> 386.80]  is underneath the authority of Jesus.
[388.08 --> 389.44]  That's a pretty radical statement.
[390.30 --> 391.56]  And notice how Jesus doesn't say,
[391.72 --> 392.96]  it will be given to me.
[393.40 --> 396.76]  He says, that authority has been given to me by the Father.
[396.76 --> 400.94]  And I can't help but think of those words in the book of Revelation
[400.94 --> 404.96]  when John is receiving a revelation from Jesus about who Jesus is.
[405.06 --> 406.16]  John describes Jesus.
[406.30 --> 407.66]  In the very first chapter, he says,
[408.04 --> 411.48]  he is the firstborn among the dead.
[411.90 --> 412.76]  That's what gives Jesus authority.
[412.84 --> 413.76]  He rose from the grave.
[413.84 --> 414.60]  He defeated death.
[414.92 --> 415.74]  And then John says,
[415.86 --> 419.52]  and he is the ruler of the kings of the earth.
[420.62 --> 422.06]  That's a statement of authority.
[422.06 --> 425.24]  And it's not that it's coming at the end, which is true,
[425.34 --> 428.52]  but Jesus already now, by virtue of his resurrection,
[428.66 --> 430.32]  has been given all authority from the Father
[430.32 --> 432.98]  to govern over his Father's creation.
[434.36 --> 437.68]  And of the many things I could say about this statement that Jesus makes,
[438.24 --> 439.04]  let me say this.
[439.92 --> 441.84]  These words are profoundly comforting to believers.
[442.70 --> 443.98]  No matter how dark your life is,
[444.02 --> 446.50]  no matter how hard our lives are in this creation,
[446.58 --> 448.98]  which is still experiencing the effects of rebellion,
[448.98 --> 454.06]  we know that ultimately all authority already is in the hands of Jesus,
[454.20 --> 455.68]  who rules over the world with grace,
[456.50 --> 459.94]  with power, in justice, and in love.
[460.64 --> 462.26]  It's in his hands.
[463.90 --> 466.00]  And then on the heels of this statement, what does Jesus say?
[466.80 --> 468.10]  All authority is mine,
[468.58 --> 472.82]  therefore go and make disciples of all nations.
[473.50 --> 474.70]  That's sort of the because.
[475.04 --> 475.98]  All authority is mine.
[475.98 --> 480.26]  Now, because of that, you need to tell the world that all authority is mine.
[480.86 --> 482.56]  Not everybody knows that Jesus is Lord.
[482.90 --> 486.18]  Many people have not heard that Jesus has resurrected from the dead.
[486.40 --> 489.78]  So the disciples, this little group of followers,
[490.18 --> 493.46]  some of whom even in this moment of the commissioning, were doubting.
[493.96 --> 494.42]  Jesus says,
[494.82 --> 497.78]  you share with the world that I'm the king.
[498.30 --> 501.80]  You live out your lives demonstrating the life of God.
[501.80 --> 505.60]  You speak the words of Jesus' resurrection so that people will come to faith
[505.60 --> 508.64]  and join you in worshiping and following Jesus.
[510.44 --> 513.20]  Now, this is a bit of a sidebar, but I think it's an important one.
[513.70 --> 516.84]  Oftentimes, when people teach or preach on the Great Commission,
[516.98 --> 518.68]  they emphasize that word, go.
[519.08 --> 520.94]  You know, it's the famous missionary sending verse,
[521.02 --> 524.66]  and I know we have students here who are studying translation and linguistics
[524.66 --> 526.02]  to go to different parts of the world,
[526.22 --> 527.70]  and we celebrate that.
[527.70 --> 531.68]  But I just want to highlight that it's not just about going to other nations
[531.68 --> 534.52]  and evangelizing people who have not yet heard the gospel.
[535.20 --> 538.04]  In fact, I agree with the translators of this passage who say
[538.04 --> 540.16]  the best way to translate Matthew 28 is,
[540.66 --> 543.40]  as you go, make disciples.
[543.84 --> 546.84]  As you go into other countries, as you go into your workplace,
[547.38 --> 550.96]  as you go into the classroom, as you go into your neighborhood, make disciples.
[551.12 --> 554.16]  It is about global mission, and it is about local mission.
[554.16 --> 558.06]  In fact, the best summary of Matthew 28 is the whole church,
[558.16 --> 562.04]  the global church, bringing the whole gospel to the whole world.
[563.08 --> 565.10]  And one of the gifts of being in British Columbia
[565.10 --> 569.16]  is that we get to do ministry in a city where the nations actually gather.
[569.68 --> 571.74]  You know, people from different parts of Canada often will say
[571.74 --> 574.56]  when they come to BC, wow, BC is a diverse place.
[574.72 --> 577.86]  It brings many nations, and for us, we get to make disciples of many nations
[577.86 --> 581.04]  in one place here in our own city.
[581.04 --> 585.92]  But here now comes the question that I'm going to spend most of our time on this morning.
[586.50 --> 589.34]  Very basic and very important. Are you ready for it?
[589.92 --> 590.82]  The question is this.
[591.44 --> 594.16]  How in the world do we make disciples?
[595.84 --> 599.84]  What does it look like to go and make disciples?
[599.98 --> 603.54]  This is like a first-order question, and I'm asking it for a few reasons.
[604.42 --> 607.16]  There are a lot of conversations among local pastors,
[607.80 --> 609.56]  many Canadian North American pastors too,
[609.56 --> 611.18]  who are saying, okay, how do we disciple?
[611.88 --> 614.72]  Like, what's the process by which we make disciples?
[614.88 --> 617.38]  And it's well-acknowledged by many honest pastors
[617.38 --> 622.06]  that we have what one of my favorite writers says is a discipleship crisis
[622.06 --> 624.84]  where churches are actually not discipling.
[625.40 --> 626.86]  We're not making disciples.
[627.00 --> 628.94]  Churches sometimes look more like a social club.
[629.58 --> 631.86]  And I think we have to ask even a more basic question.
[632.18 --> 634.36]  Not only are we worried about how to make disciples
[634.36 --> 637.42]  and how confusing that is, how are we being disciples?
[638.02 --> 639.32]  And these things are deeply connected.
[640.44 --> 642.54]  If you were at Hope a year and a half ago,
[643.06 --> 644.28]  and you have a perfect memory,
[644.42 --> 646.20]  you'll remember that we preached a sermon series
[646.20 --> 647.70]  called Apprenticing with Jesus.
[647.82 --> 648.90]  Do some of you remember this?
[649.28 --> 649.72]  Of course.
[649.82 --> 651.24]  You probably remember every sermon from that.
[652.10 --> 654.20]  You'll know that when we talked about discipleship,
[654.28 --> 656.98]  the word that we like to use the most was apprenticeship.
[656.98 --> 660.80]  That something about apprenticeship gives a vision for discipleship
[660.80 --> 662.86]  where you're like, you're on the ground, you're learning,
[663.18 --> 664.58]  you're getting practical know-how,
[664.72 --> 666.66]  you're sort of following the footsteps of someone.
[666.94 --> 669.12]  That's what we believe discipleship is with Jesus.
[670.34 --> 672.34]  John Mark Comer, an author I quite like,
[672.44 --> 674.88]  describes apprenticeship or discipleship in this way.
[674.96 --> 677.14]  This is kind of a working definition of discipleship.
[677.54 --> 681.20]  It's being with Jesus, it's becoming like Jesus,
[681.86 --> 683.36]  and it's doing what Jesus did.
[683.60 --> 684.10]  I like that.
[684.10 --> 688.62]  Being with Jesus, presence, learning from his character,
[688.80 --> 691.98]  being like Jesus, and then actually doing the things that Jesus did.
[692.72 --> 695.96]  Practicing justice, hospitality, caring for the poor,
[696.44 --> 698.54]  speaking words of encouragement, grace, and love.
[698.60 --> 700.06]  That's all part of discipleship.
[700.86 --> 703.04]  Another writer that I've quoted too many times already
[703.04 --> 704.62]  in this sermon series, Dallas Willard,
[705.10 --> 708.12]  his way of framing discipleship I think is also very clear
[708.12 --> 709.36]  and concise for us to remember.
[709.48 --> 711.28]  He says, every Christian should be asking the question,
[711.92 --> 713.64]  what kind of life would Jesus live?
[714.48 --> 716.06]  If Jesus lived my life.
[717.32 --> 718.96]  What kind of life would Jesus live?
[719.02 --> 721.60]  If my life were his, and my family were his,
[721.68 --> 722.98]  and my responsibilities were his,
[723.08 --> 724.32]  how would he treat his coworkers?
[724.48 --> 727.18]  How would he live with the neighbors that he has if they were mine?
[727.24 --> 730.64]  How would he treat his spouse and raise his kids if my life were his?
[730.68 --> 732.70]  That's a really good question.
[732.70 --> 737.48]  What kind of life would Jesus live if Jesus lived my life?
[738.88 --> 743.88]  And then to go make disciples is basically inviting others in on your life
[743.88 --> 745.62]  as you seek to follow Jesus.
[746.08 --> 750.74]  It's inviting other people into the community as we seek to follow Jesus together.
[751.42 --> 755.36]  And it goes without saying, but I think in an individualistic culture,
[755.46 --> 756.36]  we need to repeat this.
[756.36 --> 759.82]  Discipleship is never a solo project.
[760.48 --> 762.18]  It is never a me and Jesus.
[763.02 --> 764.30]  Discipleship is always communal.
[764.42 --> 766.32]  In fact, Jesus commissions his disciples together.
[766.44 --> 769.22]  Throughout the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is always sending groups of believers
[769.22 --> 773.24]  to make Jesus known because it's not a solo project.
[773.24 --> 775.56]  In fact, let me make a bold statement.
[776.60 --> 777.96]  I'm pretty sure I'm right on this one.
[778.78 --> 781.38]  Almost all the practices and habits in your life
[781.38 --> 784.42]  that are faithfully nourishing your life in Jesus
[784.42 --> 787.42]  are probably learned from another believer.
[788.74 --> 792.28]  Someone in your life, it could be a grandparent, a friend, a parent, a youth pastor,
[792.64 --> 795.38]  they modeled for you a way of following Jesus
[795.38 --> 798.00]  that you sort of picked up from that relationship.
[798.98 --> 800.14]  Let me give you some examples.
[800.14 --> 806.00]  If you're a generous person, it's likely that that's just not how you are.
[806.08 --> 809.92]  You learned it from watching someone in your life practice generosity
[809.92 --> 812.40]  with their resources, with their time, with their money.
[812.82 --> 814.28]  There's a way in which you pick that up from someone.
[814.34 --> 815.48]  You say, yes, that's how I want to be.
[815.56 --> 817.62]  I'm being invited into a way of living.
[818.26 --> 820.44]  Or if you're a hospitable person, there's a good chance
[820.44 --> 822.76]  that when you were a poor university student, you had no money,
[823.08 --> 825.38]  someone from the church took you in their home, they fed you,
[825.46 --> 826.70]  you felt like you were part of their family,
[826.78 --> 828.84]  and you thought, oh, that's how I want to live.
[828.84 --> 829.70]  I want to be hospitable.
[830.86 --> 833.26]  Or prayer, practicing devotions.
[833.40 --> 836.28]  You probably picked that up from a youth pastor, a friend at school,
[836.40 --> 837.64]  a coworker who invited you to church.
[837.72 --> 841.12]  There's someone who showed you how to read the Bible and how to pray.
[841.72 --> 844.78]  In fact, I've noticed that a lot of kids, when you pray with kids
[844.78 --> 845.84]  and then you meet their parents, they're like,
[845.94 --> 847.44]  oh, they learned how to pray like their parents.
[847.90 --> 849.30]  Because that's how discipleship works.
[849.38 --> 852.44]  You pick up the way of speaking, a way of living, a way of doing devotions,
[852.78 --> 856.38]  a way of practicing justice by watching other believers do it.
[856.38 --> 861.64]  You know, a really core memory for me growing up is that my dad was an early riser.
[861.72 --> 863.60]  He was often up and out of the house before we got up.
[863.90 --> 867.38]  And I would know that my dad was awake because there would be the Bible on the table,
[867.52 --> 868.30]  on our kitchen table.
[868.60 --> 871.80]  And if you grew up in the CRC, he had the today devotional with it.
[871.80 --> 874.62]  And I knew, okay, dad was awake, the Bible's on the table.
[874.70 --> 876.16]  But that was deeply formative for me.
[876.66 --> 879.08]  He was modeling for me, like, if you want to follow Jesus
[879.08 --> 882.16]  and you want your family to follow Jesus, you start your day in the Word.
[882.82 --> 885.24]  And I, to this day, want my days to start in the Word
[885.24 --> 887.00]  because that's how I've been formed by my dad.
[888.58 --> 891.32]  All these practices we pick up through community.
[892.34 --> 897.38]  Listening, speaking, following Jesus in very ordinary ways, they model it for us.
[897.38 --> 900.76]  In fact, I couldn't help but think this week, as I was reflecting on discipleship,
[901.06 --> 904.42]  that there's a lot of overlap between parenting and discipleship, right?
[904.94 --> 905.74]  It's very hard.
[906.10 --> 906.84]  It's very slow.
[907.06 --> 908.28]  It's a very patient process.
[908.42 --> 909.32]  It doesn't happen quickly.
[909.60 --> 911.16]  And there's lots of ups and downs.
[911.54 --> 914.92]  And as the researchers say about parenting, I think it's also true of discipleship.
[915.78 --> 920.50]  Your kids become what you do and how you model, not what you say they should do, right?
[921.00 --> 922.96]  The best parenting is never like, hey, you should do this.
[923.02 --> 924.50]  I'm not doing it, but you need to do this.
[924.50 --> 927.26]  The best parenting is, watch me live this life.
[927.72 --> 929.84]  I'm now inviting you to model your life after me.
[930.04 --> 930.94]  That's discipleship.
[932.12 --> 934.82]  Inviting other people to follow us as we follow Jesus.
[935.06 --> 937.92]  Inviting other people into a community where we're seeking to follow Jesus
[937.92 --> 942.52]  so they can grow and pick up the habits that nurture and nourish their life in Jesus.
[944.66 --> 946.46]  And I just want to be really upfront.
[946.78 --> 948.04]  I'm going to ask two important questions.
[948.14 --> 952.82]  But before I say that, I think it's important to be honest that in church somehow,
[952.82 --> 957.94]  especially in the West, we can think that you can go to church and discipleship isn't central.
[959.10 --> 964.16]  You can be part of church your whole life and still not think that you're invited to be discipled by other people
[964.16 --> 968.78]  and that you are invited, commanded, I should add, to disciple others.
[969.30 --> 970.80]  Okay, that is a command of Jesus.
[970.90 --> 972.20]  The only question is, will we be faithful?
[972.90 --> 976.94]  But out of that conviction then comes two questions that we're going to bring to our small groups this week
[976.94 --> 980.56]  and two questions I'd love for you to take to your lunch table this afternoon.
[980.66 --> 981.10]  You want to there?
[981.30 --> 984.82]  Number one, who are you being discipled by?
[986.96 --> 989.08]  And I'd love for you just to percolate for a moment.
[989.64 --> 992.14]  When I ask this question, are there people who come to mind?
[993.00 --> 995.32]  Who are you being discipled by?
[995.32 --> 1003.08]  And it's worth saying, if there are really significant people who have formed your faith
[1003.08 --> 1007.14]  and discipled you in the way of Jesus, take some time this week to thank them.
[1008.20 --> 1011.10]  It is remarkable to me, and I know this from so many stories in our church,
[1011.18 --> 1013.44]  how God just brings people into our lives.
[1014.12 --> 1016.02]  You know, we can move to Clayton, we're new to the city,
[1016.10 --> 1018.78]  and somehow he just brings the right people in who will take you in,
[1019.16 --> 1022.48]  open their home, invite you to a small group, start sharing their faith with you,
[1022.48 --> 1024.66]  and like God's just saying, I want you to be discipled by them.
[1024.88 --> 1026.32]  And if you're here and you know that's your story,
[1026.42 --> 1031.04]  make a point of thanking those people who God brought into your life for your formation.
[1031.96 --> 1034.90]  But secondly, lean into those relationships.
[1035.26 --> 1037.12]  If there are people like, yes, I know they're in my life,
[1037.20 --> 1038.30]  I'm not spending any time with them,
[1038.48 --> 1041.02]  I know they are the kind of people I want to become like,
[1041.54 --> 1044.30]  relationships of those kind are so important.
[1045.10 --> 1047.40]  Text that person this week, set up the coffee,
[1047.78 --> 1050.86]  make a point of allowing their life to form yours.
[1050.86 --> 1052.48]  This is what it means to be church.
[1054.34 --> 1059.76]  Secondly, equally important, who are you discipling?
[1061.90 --> 1063.16]  I'll just be straight up with you.
[1063.24 --> 1065.38]  Somehow we can read a passage like Matthew 28,
[1065.78 --> 1067.62]  and we hear it as saying,
[1068.32 --> 1071.52]  go therefore and hire some pastors and missionaries,
[1071.80 --> 1073.98]  and they're going to do all the discipleship for you
[1073.98 --> 1075.48]  so that you don't have to do it.
[1076.22 --> 1078.08]  And that is not what this passage is saying.
[1078.08 --> 1080.36]  Okay, Jesus is commissioning all of his disciples,
[1081.20 --> 1083.28]  and they represent all people in the church.
[1083.86 --> 1084.94]  And if the church is to be healthy,
[1085.10 --> 1087.62]  all of us are invited to both being discipled by others
[1087.62 --> 1090.16]  and discipling others as well.
[1091.16 --> 1093.86]  Nicky Gumbel, who started Alpha in the world,
[1093.98 --> 1095.72]  Alpha sort of introduces Christian faith.
[1096.38 --> 1098.52]  He made this image that I chuckle by,
[1098.60 --> 1099.74]  and hopefully it's not too offensive,
[1099.86 --> 1100.14]  but he says,
[1100.14 --> 1103.50]  sometimes churches are like football stadiums.
[1103.50 --> 1108.54]  You have 20,000 fans desperately in need of exercise,
[1108.94 --> 1112.64]  cheering on 20 players who are desperately in need of a break.
[1114.10 --> 1114.80]  And he says,
[1114.96 --> 1116.38]  that is not the church.
[1116.92 --> 1118.86]  You do not have 20 believers in the church
[1118.86 --> 1121.28]  scrambling around to try to make disciples
[1121.28 --> 1123.34]  while the rest watch those people and cheer them on.
[1123.56 --> 1126.12]  All of us are invited to discipleship.
[1126.98 --> 1128.26]  Every single one of us,
[1128.28 --> 1129.30]  from the oldest to the youngest,
[1129.46 --> 1131.22]  from the newest believer to the most seasoned believer,
[1131.22 --> 1134.42]  is invited to be discipled and to disciple others.
[1135.14 --> 1136.90]  And the question is always the same,
[1137.00 --> 1139.44]  will we be faithful to it?
[1141.46 --> 1142.34]  You know, this week,
[1142.46 --> 1143.66]  and actually last week as well,
[1143.76 --> 1146.34]  our staff has been talking a fair bit about discipleship.
[1147.42 --> 1148.58]  And we realize that
[1148.58 --> 1150.86]  when you're with other leaders in the church
[1150.86 --> 1152.44]  or you're spending time with other pastors,
[1153.00 --> 1154.96]  there's ways that we compare notes
[1154.96 --> 1158.54]  and we sort of measure the health of a church.
[1158.54 --> 1160.84]  And the two questions that often get asked
[1160.84 --> 1162.36]  in very, you know, gentle ways,
[1162.42 --> 1163.20]  but we want to know,
[1163.36 --> 1164.76]  it determines whether a church is healthy.
[1165.12 --> 1165.66]  Number one,
[1166.00 --> 1167.74]  a pastor will often ask another pastor,
[1168.44 --> 1169.76]  how big is your church?
[1170.96 --> 1171.94]  And I always tell people,
[1171.98 --> 1172.60]  I round up,
[1172.68 --> 1173.36]  so if people ask me that,
[1173.40 --> 1173.58]  I'm like,
[1173.62 --> 1175.24]  well, we're bigger than Village Church.
[1176.64 --> 1177.84]  At least 2,000.
[1178.14 --> 1178.64]  3,000.
[1179.42 --> 1180.26]  But there's that question,
[1180.32 --> 1180.86]  how big is your church?
[1180.90 --> 1181.98]  And the second question is always like,
[1182.06 --> 1183.10]  are you meeting your budget?
[1183.24 --> 1184.64]  Like, how's the numbers going?
[1184.76 --> 1186.82]  And the answer to those two questions is like,
[1186.82 --> 1188.30]  okay, are you healthy, are you not?
[1188.34 --> 1189.18]  If you're small
[1189.18 --> 1190.22]  and you're not meeting your budget,
[1190.32 --> 1190.88]  you're not healthy,
[1191.00 --> 1192.42]  which is, in my opinion,
[1192.58 --> 1193.44]  not a great metric.
[1194.14 --> 1195.44]  Someone in the 9 a.m. service says,
[1195.54 --> 1196.94]  their metric for healthy church is
[1196.94 --> 1199.48]  your funerals over your baptism ratio.
[1199.86 --> 1200.70]  And I'm not sure,
[1200.86 --> 1202.52]  that's probably a metric.
[1203.68 --> 1205.06]  But let me just suggest to you
[1205.06 --> 1207.26]  that for me and for our staff at Hope,
[1207.66 --> 1209.34]  one of the questions that we're asking is,
[1209.40 --> 1210.66]  it's not about numbers necessarily,
[1210.76 --> 1211.50]  it's not about attendance.
[1211.50 --> 1213.12]  It's how many people
[1213.12 --> 1215.32]  that God has entrusted to this community
[1215.32 --> 1219.44]  are meaningfully engaged in discipleship.
[1220.60 --> 1221.56]  And to be honest,
[1221.66 --> 1223.10]  I really think that's one of the questions
[1223.10 --> 1224.18]  that we as leaders
[1224.18 --> 1226.08]  will have to answer to Jesus when he returns.
[1226.72 --> 1228.26]  I don't think Jesus is gonna be that concerned
[1228.26 --> 1230.46]  if Hope Community Church is 50 or 500
[1230.46 --> 1232.16]  or 5,000 bigger than village.
[1232.42 --> 1233.10]  The question is,
[1233.20 --> 1233.88]  were we faithful
[1233.88 --> 1236.66]  with what God entrusted us to do?
[1236.66 --> 1238.30]  And if I'm hearing Matthew 28 right,
[1239.18 --> 1239.86]  the question is,
[1239.98 --> 1241.10]  are you being discipled?
[1241.50 --> 1242.68]  And are you discipling?
[1243.14 --> 1244.62]  How many people at Hope Community Church
[1244.62 --> 1245.94]  are meaningfully engaged
[1245.94 --> 1246.84]  in small groups,
[1247.42 --> 1248.42]  in service ministries,
[1248.94 --> 1250.28]  in youth and young adults,
[1250.74 --> 1251.98]  caring for the people in our city?
[1252.18 --> 1254.56]  How many of us are meaningfully engaged
[1254.56 --> 1256.54]  in the life of discipleship?
[1256.60 --> 1258.18]  That to me is like the key.
[1258.76 --> 1260.24]  And if only 10% of us
[1260.24 --> 1262.26]  are meaningfully engaged in discipleship,
[1262.38 --> 1263.56]  Nikki Gumbel is right.
[1264.34 --> 1265.66]  And we are very unhealthy.
[1265.66 --> 1267.90]  And as we increase that number,
[1268.02 --> 1268.22]  I mean,
[1268.30 --> 1269.36]  I was told at the ministry
[1269.36 --> 1270.90]  Volunteer Appreciation Sunday
[1270.90 --> 1272.44]  that there's a lot of people in our church
[1272.44 --> 1274.22]  who are involved in a variety of ways
[1274.22 --> 1274.66]  and I'm encouraged
[1274.66 --> 1276.24]  because the greater percentage of us
[1276.24 --> 1277.40]  that are meaningfully involved
[1277.40 --> 1278.50]  in discipleship ministries,
[1279.00 --> 1281.04]  the healthier we will be.
[1282.40 --> 1283.92]  And just a story to encourage us,
[1284.02 --> 1284.18]  you know,
[1284.70 --> 1286.06]  in the last number of months,
[1286.76 --> 1287.10]  I was,
[1287.30 --> 1287.44]  you know,
[1287.52 --> 1288.10]  you'll be at the church
[1288.10 --> 1288.96]  on different nights of the week
[1288.96 --> 1289.70]  and it's very encouraging.
[1289.86 --> 1289.98]  You know,
[1290.04 --> 1291.06]  you'll see on one night
[1291.06 --> 1291.82]  a number of young adults
[1291.82 --> 1292.66]  gathering together
[1292.66 --> 1293.92]  and then another night
[1293.92 --> 1295.00]  you'll see one of those young adults
[1295.00 --> 1295.62]  discipling,
[1295.66 --> 1296.42]  on a youth night.
[1296.88 --> 1297.52]  And then sometimes
[1297.52 --> 1298.16]  on a Sunday morning,
[1298.22 --> 1299.16]  I'll see some of those youth
[1299.16 --> 1300.84]  discipling our cornerstone children
[1300.84 --> 1302.26]  and I find that so moving.
[1302.92 --> 1303.48]  You've got people
[1303.48 --> 1304.76]  who are not being paid to do this.
[1304.84 --> 1305.26]  There's no one
[1305.26 --> 1306.24]  who requires them to do it,
[1306.26 --> 1307.78]  but discipleship is moving down.
[1308.08 --> 1308.74]  And you've got children
[1308.74 --> 1310.04]  in grade four and five and six
[1310.04 --> 1311.74]  sitting down with preschoolers,
[1312.18 --> 1313.44]  some of which are my own children
[1313.44 --> 1314.04]  and these students
[1314.04 --> 1315.22]  are learning to pray with them,
[1315.52 --> 1316.34]  teaching them the scriptures
[1316.34 --> 1318.76]  and that is discipleship.
[1319.40 --> 1320.82]  Let me say to our grade four,
[1320.96 --> 1321.20]  five,
[1321.32 --> 1321.56]  six,
[1321.66 --> 1322.50]  our high school students,
[1322.50 --> 1324.76]  you are invited by Jesus
[1324.76 --> 1327.26]  not just to receive discipleship,
[1327.68 --> 1329.64]  but to also give discipleship.
[1330.32 --> 1331.14]  And there's always
[1331.14 --> 1331.96]  the younger sibling,
[1332.22 --> 1333.44]  there's always the kid down the road,
[1333.50 --> 1334.26]  there's always someone
[1334.26 --> 1335.12]  in your life
[1335.12 --> 1337.02]  who you are being invited
[1337.02 --> 1338.72]  to be the presence of Christ,
[1339.26 --> 1339.94]  the intercessor
[1339.94 --> 1341.02]  and the teacher
[1341.02 --> 1341.86]  of the way of Jesus.
[1341.86 --> 1345.74]  And I am quite convinced
[1345.74 --> 1346.98]  that no one needs to go
[1346.98 --> 1347.96]  into the middle of the city
[1347.96 --> 1349.40]  to find that person to disciple.
[1349.50 --> 1350.64]  They're already in your life.
[1351.28 --> 1352.12]  It's going to be the children
[1352.12 --> 1352.74]  in your home,
[1352.82 --> 1353.94]  the people who live next door,
[1354.04 --> 1354.72]  the lady who works
[1354.72 --> 1355.92]  in the cubicle to your left.
[1356.12 --> 1356.80]  It's going to be people
[1356.80 --> 1357.76]  who are already in your life
[1357.76 --> 1358.66]  where God is inviting you
[1358.66 --> 1359.54]  to be intentional
[1359.54 --> 1361.08]  in sharing
[1361.08 --> 1362.42]  and living out the gospel
[1362.42 --> 1363.76]  and inviting them
[1363.76 --> 1364.62]  on that journey with you.
[1364.70 --> 1366.20]  That is the essence of it.
[1368.54 --> 1370.20]  Jesus adds to the command
[1370.20 --> 1370.82]  to disciple
[1370.82 --> 1372.44]  two specific things.
[1372.96 --> 1373.36]  He says,
[1373.86 --> 1375.86]  disciple people of all nations
[1375.86 --> 1376.92]  and then what does he add to it?
[1378.04 --> 1378.66]  Baptize them
[1378.66 --> 1379.56]  in the name of the Father,
[1379.70 --> 1380.10]  the Son,
[1380.14 --> 1380.88]  and the Holy Spirit
[1380.88 --> 1382.84]  and teach them
[1382.84 --> 1384.14]  everything
[1384.14 --> 1386.24]  I have commanded you.
[1386.70 --> 1387.84]  Let me just briefly reflect
[1387.84 --> 1388.54]  on those two things
[1388.54 --> 1389.40]  because for me,
[1389.56 --> 1390.36]  maybe it's just me,
[1390.82 --> 1391.76]  the fact that Jesus
[1391.76 --> 1392.86]  adds baptism
[1392.86 --> 1394.30]  to his final statement
[1394.30 --> 1395.02]  to his disciples
[1395.02 --> 1396.08]  is interesting.
[1396.64 --> 1397.20]  Of all the things
[1397.20 --> 1397.62]  he could have said,
[1397.66 --> 1397.84]  he says,
[1397.92 --> 1398.88]  make sure that happens.
[1399.24 --> 1399.92]  And here's why.
[1399.98 --> 1400.66]  If you've been to a baptism
[1400.66 --> 1401.10]  about hope,
[1401.40 --> 1402.22]  you'll know that we say
[1402.22 --> 1402.94]  it's number one,
[1403.20 --> 1404.80]  being grafted into a community.
[1404.86 --> 1405.88]  A child or an adult
[1405.88 --> 1406.78]  when they come to faith,
[1407.08 --> 1407.96]  they're being grafted
[1407.96 --> 1408.76]  into the church.
[1409.28 --> 1410.10]  It's a sacrament
[1410.10 --> 1411.16]  of initiation.
[1412.00 --> 1413.20]  But the reason it matters
[1413.20 --> 1414.28]  is because we believe
[1414.28 --> 1415.14]  that the church
[1415.14 --> 1415.90]  is a community
[1415.90 --> 1417.20]  that is connected
[1417.20 --> 1418.18]  to the life
[1418.18 --> 1419.58]  of our triune God.
[1420.30 --> 1421.36]  Such that when a baby
[1421.36 --> 1421.92]  or an adult
[1421.92 --> 1422.92]  is baptized into the church,
[1423.04 --> 1424.20]  we really do believe
[1424.20 --> 1425.76]  that they are being connected
[1425.76 --> 1428.04]  to the resurrection power
[1428.04 --> 1428.58]  of Jesus.
[1429.44 --> 1430.44]  That the Holy Spirit
[1430.44 --> 1432.30]  really does live
[1432.30 --> 1433.32]  in our church
[1433.32 --> 1433.92]  when we gather
[1433.92 --> 1434.72]  in our homes,
[1434.94 --> 1435.78]  when we're in the neighborhood,
[1435.98 --> 1436.90]  in our workplaces
[1436.90 --> 1437.74]  as we do our work,
[1438.10 --> 1439.48]  the Jesus who we worship
[1439.48 --> 1441.40]  is with us.
[1442.14 --> 1443.58]  Such that when we baptize
[1443.58 --> 1444.04]  someone then,
[1444.24 --> 1444.92]  we are saying,
[1445.28 --> 1446.52]  you are being grafted
[1446.52 --> 1447.58]  into the power
[1447.58 --> 1449.06]  of the living God.
[1449.48 --> 1450.52]  That's why it matters.
[1451.52 --> 1452.30]  And then I will repeat
[1452.30 --> 1453.04]  something we've said
[1453.04 --> 1453.80]  a few times now
[1453.80 --> 1454.36]  in this series.
[1455.16 --> 1456.04]  That discipleship
[1456.04 --> 1457.36]  is learning.
[1458.24 --> 1460.04]  So much of discipleship
[1460.04 --> 1460.60]  in my life,
[1460.64 --> 1461.42]  and I'm sure you can attest
[1461.42 --> 1461.88]  to this if you've been
[1461.88 --> 1462.62]  a believer for a while,
[1462.98 --> 1464.28]  is learning the way
[1464.28 --> 1464.70]  of Jesus.
[1465.24 --> 1466.28]  Learning the scriptures,
[1466.44 --> 1467.54]  having someone teach them,
[1467.84 --> 1468.38]  preach them,
[1468.68 --> 1469.30]  talk about them
[1469.30 --> 1469.98]  in the small group.
[1470.06 --> 1470.84]  We have to learn
[1470.84 --> 1472.02]  the way of Jesus.
[1472.62 --> 1473.38]  And you are committing
[1473.38 --> 1474.34]  by being a disciple
[1474.34 --> 1476.48]  to a lifelong process
[1476.48 --> 1478.06]  of living according
[1478.06 --> 1478.78]  to the scriptures.
[1479.66 --> 1480.46]  And Jesus, you know,
[1480.52 --> 1481.40]  doesn't mince his words.
[1481.86 --> 1482.84]  Teach new disciples
[1482.84 --> 1484.62]  to obey,
[1485.30 --> 1486.26]  not just a little bit,
[1486.56 --> 1487.42]  but everything
[1487.42 --> 1489.14]  I have commanded you.
[1489.86 --> 1490.74]  That's quite something.
[1490.90 --> 1491.52]  Not just the verses
[1491.52 --> 1492.06]  you like,
[1492.56 --> 1493.46]  not just the passages
[1493.46 --> 1494.04]  you've memorized
[1494.04 --> 1494.78]  when you're in grade 7,
[1495.10 --> 1498.12]  everything I have commanded you.
[1499.62 --> 1501.10]  Teach them the whole story.
[1502.36 --> 1503.12]  Teach them what it means
[1503.12 --> 1504.12]  to love the Lord
[1504.12 --> 1505.08]  with all of our hearts
[1505.08 --> 1506.24]  and love our neighbors
[1506.24 --> 1507.48]  as ourselves.
[1508.10 --> 1509.42]  Teach them the story
[1509.42 --> 1509.96]  that his death
[1509.96 --> 1510.96]  and resurrection fulfilled
[1510.96 --> 1511.62]  in the Old Testament,
[1511.82 --> 1512.48]  and teach them
[1512.48 --> 1513.86]  the part that we have to play
[1513.86 --> 1515.74]  as the church of Jesus Christ
[1515.74 --> 1516.56]  in the New Testament.
[1517.94 --> 1518.46]  Teach them.
[1520.94 --> 1521.82]  Make disciples
[1521.82 --> 1522.80]  of all nations.
[1523.34 --> 1524.02]  Baptize them
[1524.02 --> 1524.80]  in the name of the Father,
[1524.96 --> 1525.98]  Son, and Holy Spirit,
[1526.22 --> 1526.80]  and teach them
[1526.80 --> 1527.86]  to obey everything
[1527.86 --> 1529.04]  I have commanded you.
[1529.26 --> 1531.06]  That's the command
[1531.06 --> 1531.70]  of Jesus
[1531.70 --> 1533.02]  for the church.
[1534.04 --> 1535.04]  And I will say again,
[1535.62 --> 1536.46]  it is possible
[1536.46 --> 1538.16]  to grow up in the church
[1538.16 --> 1539.80]  and not take this seriously.
[1540.52 --> 1541.16]  It's possible
[1541.16 --> 1542.48]  to be a lifelong Christian
[1542.48 --> 1543.78]  and never really say,
[1543.90 --> 1544.14]  Jesus,
[1544.72 --> 1546.40]  am I obeying the command
[1546.40 --> 1547.06]  you give us
[1547.06 --> 1547.82]  in the Great Commission?
[1548.82 --> 1549.66]  And there's a whole
[1549.66 --> 1550.38]  variety of reasons,
[1550.46 --> 1550.94]  I don't have time
[1550.94 --> 1551.56]  to get into them,
[1551.64 --> 1553.14]  why people don't disciple,
[1553.54 --> 1554.32]  why we're not intentional
[1554.32 --> 1555.22]  with our discipleship,
[1555.34 --> 1556.06]  but this morning
[1556.06 --> 1557.54]  we have God's Word before us.
[1558.26 --> 1559.42]  We have Jesus' command
[1559.42 --> 1559.98]  before us,
[1560.02 --> 1560.84]  and we have two options.
[1561.58 --> 1563.06]  We can obey His command
[1563.06 --> 1564.50]  and be faithful
[1564.50 --> 1565.02]  to what it means
[1565.02 --> 1565.74]  to be the church,
[1566.02 --> 1567.88]  or we can disobey His command
[1567.88 --> 1569.98]  and neglect discipleship.
[1570.52 --> 1571.50]  And I promise you,
[1571.94 --> 1573.12]  the future of a church
[1573.12 --> 1574.00]  that doesn't disciple
[1574.00 --> 1575.58]  is in serious,
[1576.08 --> 1576.80]  serious risk.
[1577.60 --> 1578.22]  I would say
[1578.22 --> 1578.78]  that's also true
[1578.78 --> 1579.22]  of the present.
[1579.92 --> 1580.44]  The invitation
[1580.44 --> 1581.18]  to every believer
[1581.18 --> 1581.96]  who's here this morning
[1581.96 --> 1582.78]  gathering for worship
[1582.78 --> 1584.50]  is to be discipled
[1584.50 --> 1586.22]  and to make disciples.
[1586.76 --> 1587.62]  The only question is
[1587.62 --> 1588.34]  if we'll obey
[1588.34 --> 1589.06]  and be faithful.
[1589.06 --> 1591.76]  But now I want to finish
[1591.76 --> 1592.78]  with the encouragement.
[1593.00 --> 1593.56]  Jesus starts
[1593.56 --> 1594.32]  with His authority.
[1594.86 --> 1595.70]  He gives His command
[1595.70 --> 1596.16]  to the church,
[1596.20 --> 1596.96]  and how does He finish?
[1597.92 --> 1598.86]  With His presence.
[1600.02 --> 1600.82]  He says to the church,
[1601.02 --> 1602.48]  Surely I am with you
[1602.48 --> 1603.30]  always,
[1604.06 --> 1605.32]  even to the end
[1605.32 --> 1606.34]  of the age.
[1606.80 --> 1607.70]  Oh, how I love
[1607.70 --> 1608.66]  that part of the passage.
[1609.52 --> 1610.60]  Every year when we start
[1610.60 --> 1611.88]  a new ministry season together,
[1611.98 --> 1612.60]  I think, yes,
[1612.90 --> 1613.90]  this is what we need.
[1614.16 --> 1615.02]  I don't want us to do
[1615.02 --> 1615.82]  another year of ministry
[1615.82 --> 1616.58]  in our own strength.
[1616.64 --> 1617.32]  I don't want us to try
[1617.32 --> 1618.20]  to go discipling
[1618.20 --> 1619.26]  with our own resources.
[1619.44 --> 1620.42]  I want the very power
[1620.42 --> 1621.70]  of God to be
[1621.70 --> 1622.44]  what gets us doing
[1622.44 --> 1623.24]  what we're supposed to do.
[1624.36 --> 1625.14]  And one of the promises
[1625.14 --> 1626.58]  we see throughout the story
[1626.58 --> 1627.52]  is God showing up
[1627.52 --> 1628.18]  to very weak,
[1628.28 --> 1628.80]  very timid,
[1628.88 --> 1630.40]  very fearful humans
[1630.40 --> 1631.64]  and saying to them,
[1631.76 --> 1632.70]  Don't be afraid.
[1633.84 --> 1634.80]  Do not fear.
[1635.34 --> 1637.28]  I am with you.
[1638.12 --> 1639.14]  And if I'm with you,
[1639.34 --> 1640.84]  you don't need to worry
[1640.84 --> 1641.90]  because I will be
[1641.90 --> 1642.46]  your protection.
[1643.30 --> 1644.54]  I will be your provision.
[1645.26 --> 1646.60]  I will be your encouragement.
[1646.60 --> 1648.06]  I will be the one
[1648.06 --> 1649.48]  who forgives you of sin.
[1649.82 --> 1650.60]  And I will fill you
[1650.60 --> 1651.70]  with my power
[1651.70 --> 1653.50]  to do what I'm calling you to do.
[1653.84 --> 1654.64]  Praise the Lord
[1654.64 --> 1656.04]  that Jesus is with the church.
[1657.14 --> 1657.88]  Praise the Lord
[1657.88 --> 1658.48]  that the commission
[1658.48 --> 1659.06]  he gives us
[1659.06 --> 1660.54]  is not too heavy for us
[1660.54 --> 1662.30]  because we have his power
[1662.30 --> 1663.48]  to do it.
[1664.76 --> 1665.68]  Without this,
[1666.22 --> 1666.82]  I would think
[1666.82 --> 1667.58]  the great commission
[1667.58 --> 1668.86]  would be a great burden.
[1669.46 --> 1670.58]  But because the spirit
[1670.58 --> 1671.40]  of God is with us,
[1671.46 --> 1672.36]  the resurrection power
[1672.36 --> 1673.46]  of Jesus is in us,
[1673.46 --> 1675.36]  we have everything we need
[1675.36 --> 1677.18]  to make disciples
[1677.18 --> 1679.12]  in our workplaces,
[1679.62 --> 1680.82]  in our neighborhoods,
[1681.36 --> 1682.54]  in our homes
[1682.54 --> 1683.28]  with our children,
[1683.64 --> 1684.56]  in our friendships
[1684.56 --> 1685.34]  in the city.
[1685.76 --> 1686.48]  This command
[1686.48 --> 1687.56]  is not too burdensome
[1687.56 --> 1688.80]  because the resurrected Jesus
[1688.80 --> 1690.16]  is with you.
[1691.32 --> 1692.14]  He's with you.
[1693.10 --> 1693.82]  And I feel the need
[1693.82 --> 1694.62]  to repeat the point
[1694.62 --> 1695.44]  that when you leave
[1695.44 --> 1696.20]  this building,
[1696.92 --> 1697.86]  he goes with you
[1697.86 --> 1698.52]  to your home.
[1699.18 --> 1700.06]  He's with you
[1700.06 --> 1700.72]  in your neighborhood.
[1700.72 --> 1701.90]  He's with you
[1701.90 --> 1702.98]  in all the frustrations
[1702.98 --> 1704.10]  you face at work.
[1704.66 --> 1705.20]  He's with you
[1705.20 --> 1706.04]  in the new classroom
[1706.04 --> 1707.56]  with all these strange students,
[1708.04 --> 1709.26]  enabling us to be
[1709.26 --> 1710.70]  faithful witnesses
[1710.70 --> 1711.46]  to the gospel
[1711.46 --> 1712.30]  of Jesus Christ.
[1713.46 --> 1714.62]  We started this sermon
[1714.62 --> 1715.70]  by saying
[1715.70 --> 1717.48]  that if we're faithful
[1717.48 --> 1718.44]  to the story
[1718.44 --> 1719.00]  of the scriptures,
[1719.62 --> 1720.72]  the calling of the church
[1720.72 --> 1722.28]  is discipleship.
[1723.10 --> 1724.50]  What Jesus says to us
[1724.50 --> 1725.64]  in no uncertain terms
[1725.64 --> 1727.78]  is we are commanded
[1727.78 --> 1731.60]  to go and make disciples.
[1732.64 --> 1733.46]  And we don't go
[1733.46 --> 1734.32]  in our own strength.
[1734.72 --> 1736.80]  We go in his.
[1737.54 --> 1738.32]  And I tell you what,
[1738.36 --> 1739.68]  as we start a new ministry season,
[1739.78 --> 1741.04]  my prayer is that we lean
[1741.04 --> 1742.68]  into the strength he provides
[1742.68 --> 1743.84]  and that he,
[1744.00 --> 1744.60]  by his grace,
[1744.72 --> 1745.88]  enables us to be faithful
[1745.88 --> 1747.92]  in all the spaces
[1747.92 --> 1749.46]  that he places us
[1749.46 --> 1750.54]  in this year ahead.
[1751.18 --> 1752.40]  May he receive all the glory
[1752.40 --> 1753.54]  from Hope Community Church.
[1754.48 --> 1755.62]  Would you join me in prayer?
[1757.78 --> 1763.22]  Father, we receive
[1763.22 --> 1764.22]  your word this morning
[1764.22 --> 1766.34]  and we pray that we would
[1766.34 --> 1767.64]  not just be hearers of it,
[1767.72 --> 1768.42]  but people who are
[1768.42 --> 1769.42]  obedient to it.
[1770.54 --> 1771.76]  We bring before you
[1771.76 --> 1773.12]  our fears of speaking
[1773.12 --> 1773.90]  about our faith.
[1774.62 --> 1775.44]  We bring before you
[1775.44 --> 1777.00]  the timidity we often have
[1777.00 --> 1777.88]  in making known
[1777.88 --> 1778.74]  the belief we have
[1778.74 --> 1780.00]  that Jesus really does
[1780.00 --> 1781.12]  have all authority.
[1781.74 --> 1783.04]  And we pray that you'd give us
[1783.04 --> 1784.54]  a bold humility
[1784.54 --> 1786.84]  to live what we believe,
[1786.84 --> 1788.78]  to speak what we believe,
[1789.16 --> 1790.30]  to be discipled
[1790.30 --> 1791.20]  by mature believers
[1791.20 --> 1791.70]  around us,
[1791.74 --> 1793.10]  and to invite other people
[1793.10 --> 1793.98]  to follow Jesus
