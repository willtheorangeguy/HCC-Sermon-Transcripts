[0.00 --> 3.78]  So I see someone in the service. I need to make another announcement that hasn't
[3.78 --> 9.92]  yet been made. On Friday, Chuck Gerber turned 80 years old. I don't know if you
[9.92 --> 18.08]  wanted that known, Chuck. And if you're new to Hope, you should know that Chuck was
[18.08 --> 23.70]  one of the people who served so selflessly behind the scenes. A lot of
[23.70 --> 26.72]  what we have here is because Chuck's like, we can do this. We can build this
[26.72 --> 30.46]  building. We can serve this community. And Chuck and Margaret, I also want to say that
[30.46 --> 34.26]  you two have been a gift as a married couple. You're a model for many of us
[34.26 --> 38.18]  younger couples. And we praise the Lord that you're part of our church and that you're healthy
[38.18 --> 40.46]  and you can be in worship with us this morning. That's a gift.
[42.18 --> 43.80]  Now we can clap one more time for Chuck and Margaret.
[49.40 --> 54.02]  Well, we're going to continue our series throughout Lent, a series that's on suffering with the most
[54.02 --> 59.88]  unpopular title, which is, In This World, You Will Have Trouble. And we've looked at how Jesus promises
[59.88 --> 64.04]  us trouble and the specific areas we've looked at so far where we experience it as a workplace,
[64.68 --> 68.80]  our loneliness and rejection, our broken relationships. And this morning, we're adding
[68.80 --> 74.12]  to that the trouble we have in our bodies with weakness, with pain, and with sickness. And I have
[74.12 --> 78.20]  to admit that earlier this week, I thought, I have no business preaching this sermon. You know, I've had
[78.20 --> 82.24]  relatively good health so far in my life. And I said to Sid that he should preach it because he's
[82.24 --> 85.92]  getting old, he's getting frail. And he said, no way, he's on vacation.
[88.66 --> 92.98]  But if you have your Bible, turn with me to 2 Corinthians 12. We're going to read what I think
[92.98 --> 97.28]  are fairly personal words from the Apostle Paul about his own suffering, about his own pain.
[98.78 --> 100.98]  Starting in verse 7, this is 2 Corinthians 12.
[100.98 --> 108.50]  Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh,
[109.40 --> 115.24]  a messenger from Satan to torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.
[116.08 --> 123.32]  But he said to me, my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.
[124.66 --> 130.04]  Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.
[130.98 --> 136.16]  That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in my weaknesses, and insults, and hardships, and persecution,
[136.62 --> 141.10]  and difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
[145.94 --> 151.58]  I want to begin with a question for you. The question is, what is that prayer that you have
[151.58 --> 157.46]  prayed the most for in your life? What's the thing that you've prayed so much for your life that it
[157.46 --> 161.48]  almost just comes off your tongue the second you start speaking with the Lord? The thing where you
[161.48 --> 170.08]  say to him, if you just took this thing away, I could live my life. Perhaps for you, that is chronic
[170.08 --> 178.76]  migraines, or chronic fatigue. Perhaps it's CRPS, or arthritis. Perhaps it's autism, or cancer.
[178.76 --> 185.04]  A broken back, feet that don't seem to work properly, a whole host of things fill in your blank.
[185.50 --> 190.82]  That thing where you say, Lord, if you just took that away, I could live my life. I could serve you
[190.82 --> 197.72]  faithfully. Is that thing coming to mind for you? If you've prayed that prayer, you can relate to the
[197.72 --> 204.78]  Apostle Paul. The most well-known church planter, the persecutor of the church-turned-evangelist Paul,
[204.78 --> 210.66]  in this passage, becomes very personal with the Lord. He brings before the Lord his own burdens,
[210.78 --> 215.66]  his own thorn in the flesh, and he pleads with God to take it away. And this morning, we're going
[215.66 --> 220.28]  to look not just at Paul's request for this thorn in the flesh that God would take it away,
[220.46 --> 227.12]  but also God's surprising, and you might even say God's disappointing answer for Paul, that his grace
[227.12 --> 233.64]  is sufficient. Now, I want us to see the context to this whole passage because it helps us understand
[233.64 --> 237.74]  what Paul's trying to say. He also starts with a therefore, and so when he starts with therefore,
[237.90 --> 242.32]  you know there's backstory. You need to know a little bit about the Corinthian church. Now,
[242.68 --> 247.02]  in my opinion, the Corinthian church is the most difficult of all the churches Paul planted. I
[247.02 --> 252.38]  think they're the people who give him the biggest headache. And this church is planted in a city that
[252.38 --> 256.84]  was wealthy. It was a tourist destination. It was very popular. It had a lot of opulence. And one of the
[256.84 --> 262.38]  unique things about Corinthians is that they were a city that drew in the big speakers, the big titles,
[262.38 --> 268.00]  the smart, elite philosophers who would go to the city square and give new insights, new philosophies,
[268.12 --> 272.74]  new big ideas that were going to change how people should live their lives. They were like the TED Talk
[272.74 --> 278.40]  city of the ancient world. The challenge of that is that there were Christians who were very intrigued
[278.40 --> 283.62]  by these very eloquent, persuasive philosophers, and they were being pulled away from what they believed
[283.62 --> 290.16]  in Jesus by the persuasive eloquence of these speakers. And that's a challenge for Paul. He's got these
[290.16 --> 294.18]  people in his church who are new to the faith, and he's thinking, what do I do now? I've got these
[294.18 --> 298.16]  philosophers, these speakers who are bringing these new insights that are leading Christians astray.
[299.26 --> 304.50]  And he has some options. One option is, for Paul, is that he could join that game. He could go there,
[304.58 --> 310.14]  he could speak with eloquence, he could show his smarts. Paul, after all, is highly educated. He's
[310.14 --> 314.70]  bright as a whip. I mean, even Peter, one of my favorite passages in Peter's work is where he says,
[314.70 --> 319.76]  I can't understand Paul. He's just too smart for me. And so Paul could go in there with eloquence
[319.76 --> 323.60]  and persuade and do what he needs to do to sort of bring people back, but he doesn't do that.
[324.26 --> 328.96]  In 1 Corinthians 11, actually, Paul says, if I'm going to boast, I'm going to boast of my suffering.
[329.94 --> 335.18]  Isn't that strange? And he lists this long list of things that he's been beaten, he's been imprisoned,
[335.32 --> 340.08]  he's been lashed, he's been all sorts of stuff, shipwrecked, chased out of cities by Jews,
[340.52 --> 343.96]  attacked by Gentiles, false teachers rise up against him. He's got a tough life.
[344.70 --> 349.46]  And he decides that his way of convincing these believers of what is true is by talking about
[349.46 --> 355.08]  his suffering. And he could, actually, I find it quite humorous, in chapter 12, he starts by saying,
[355.14 --> 359.68]  I could tell you eloquence, I could tell you these special dreams I've had where I went to the third
[359.68 --> 363.72]  heaven, but I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to play your game. I'm going to talk about my
[363.72 --> 368.28]  suffering. And that's where we get to our passage that I will read just the first part of again.
[369.28 --> 373.54]  He writes, therefore, in order to keep me from being conceited,
[373.54 --> 380.02]  I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me. Three times I pleaded
[380.02 --> 386.30]  with the Lord to take it away, but he said to me, my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made
[386.30 --> 393.66]  perfect in weakness. I told Val earlier this week in a staff meeting that I actually, I've decided I
[393.66 --> 400.14]  don't like this passage. This is not a popular, easy teaching, but I hope as we work it out together,
[400.14 --> 404.58]  we'll see it's beauty. Now, some of the fascinating things in this passage, the first of which to me
[404.58 --> 409.02]  is, Paul never says what the thorn in the flesh is. He never says, oh, by the way, this is what my
[409.02 --> 414.36]  thorn is. He doesn't do that. And there's at least 13 arguments that I read for different things,
[414.60 --> 420.72]  ranging from persecution to sexual temptation because Paul is single. I tend to think that the
[420.72 --> 425.28]  people who say the thorn in the flesh is actually a physical pain. It's like, the way he's describing it,
[425.28 --> 429.72]  it's almost like a stake in his body. And there's physical pain. And I think he's dealing with
[429.72 --> 434.60]  illness. He's dealing with something that makes him sick. And he's aware, perhaps what matters most,
[434.66 --> 440.06]  is that he is weak as a result of this. One writer suggests that the opponents of Paul,
[440.14 --> 443.70]  and there were no shortage of them, would have weaponized Paul's weakness against him, saying,
[443.76 --> 449.58]  look at this guy, preaching about healing, healing other people, and he himself is sick and weak.
[449.58 --> 452.96]  Like, this guy can't even heal himself. How are we supposed to listen to him talk about
[452.96 --> 458.52]  the power of Jesus, the power of resurrection when he's sick himself?
[460.74 --> 465.76]  One of the things I appreciate about Paul is his honesty about his weakness. This is not a man who's
[465.76 --> 469.78]  like, you know what, I've got this. I'm going to power through. He says, I don't want this sickness.
[470.68 --> 475.10]  And he pleads with God to take it away. And some authors argue that he didn't just say it three
[475.10 --> 479.90]  times in total, that he three times a day, or that three times represents the regularity with
[479.90 --> 487.94]  which he is crying out to the Lord, take this sickness away. And maybe you can relate to that.
[488.60 --> 491.62]  Maybe you know exactly what that's like, to be on your knees in your room saying, Lord,
[491.78 --> 496.22]  I need you to heal me. I need you to take the sickness, this illness, this weakness out of my
[496.22 --> 500.34]  body so I can live my life. And if you do, maybe you've been here too, where you're bargaining with
[500.34 --> 504.50]  the Lord. If you give me this, Lord, if you heal my body, I'll do this for you. I'll give my life to you.
[504.50 --> 509.58]  No, just make me whole. Just take this away from me. I can't live with this pain.
[511.68 --> 516.46]  Now, I'm convinced this passage would be way cooler, like way cooler, if the response to that
[516.46 --> 522.50]  pleading was, and the Lord healed Paul and he never suffered again. That isn't what the passage says,
[522.54 --> 528.54]  is it? The passage, and I believe this is the heart of our text, goes like this. Paul gives us God's
[528.54 --> 535.76]  response. And God says to him, Paul, my grace is sufficient for you. My power is made perfect
[535.76 --> 542.52]  in weakness. Now, before I dive into the depth of those words, I want to make two important
[542.52 --> 549.82]  qualifications, maybe three. Number one, as grace prayed, God can and God does heal. Okay? In the
[549.82 --> 553.44]  New Testament and today, even in our church, we've experienced the healing power of God, and we are
[553.44 --> 558.44]  invited by the scriptures to pray for healing. But what Paul is saying is that doesn't always happen.
[559.42 --> 564.80]  And for certain reasons that we barely ever are given knowledge of by God, we are not healed.
[565.72 --> 571.12]  And Paul is wrestling with that in a very personal way. And Paul knows that there's a specific reason
[571.12 --> 576.26]  related to his humility and his pride that God has allowed him to have this thorn in his flesh.
[576.90 --> 579.92]  And he's allowed Satan to torment him through this pain that he carries in his body.
[579.92 --> 585.54]  And it's important to qualify, this is the second one, that this is not a universal teaching.
[586.42 --> 594.16]  As one commentator said it so succinctly, not all who suffer are humble. And not all who are humble
[594.16 --> 598.80]  suffer, right? It's not like every single sickness we have, every time we get something going on in our
[598.80 --> 603.02]  life, it's God trying to humble us. It's not quite like that. Paul is saying, in my specific life,
[603.02 --> 610.18]  with my makeup as God's follower, God has humbled me and kept me from conceit with this thorn in my
[610.18 --> 615.98]  flesh. What I do think speaks to all of us in all of our circumstances, no matter what we're going
[615.98 --> 623.60]  through, is God's answer to Paul, where he says, my grace is sufficient for you. My power is made
[623.60 --> 629.98]  perfect in weakness. And I think we just need to stop and take in the depth of that phrase. I just think
[629.98 --> 633.72]  it's so deep, it's actually hard for me to find words to actually explain that because it just runs
[633.72 --> 640.78]  so deep. This is counterintuitive. It is certainly countercultural. And it feels paradoxical that my
[640.78 --> 648.02]  grace is sufficient for you. My power is made perfect in weakness. And the grace that God gives Paul is not
[648.02 --> 656.18]  a healing grace. It's an enduring grace. It's the grace, as one writer puts it, to limp along in the
[656.18 --> 662.56]  strength of Jesus. And what Paul is naming as he talks about the grace being sufficient is that
[662.56 --> 668.46]  somehow, mysteriously, in the depth of weakness, in the sorrow and the frustration of the pain he's
[668.46 --> 676.36]  going through in his body, Jesus, the suffering servant, shows up. And Jesus supplies him with what
[676.36 --> 681.96]  he needs out of the abundance of who Jesus is. And I have to say that that's something I'm learning
[681.96 --> 685.94]  from people in our church who've gone ahead of me. They're further on in life. They've gone through
[685.94 --> 691.28]  more hardship than me. I'm learning from them what that looks like. You know, I've been in conversation
[691.28 --> 697.64]  with Anna Marie Van Reich and Marnie Kuhl as they've gone through cancer. And I'm surprised often,
[697.94 --> 702.48]  administered to by them, when they start to say in their conversation or they just punctuate the
[702.48 --> 707.76]  conversation by saying, God is so good. God is so good. You know, he answered my prayer in this
[707.76 --> 712.64]  medication. He's answered my prayer by bringing me here. He's carrying me by the prayers of the
[712.64 --> 719.08]  people. As I go into this MRI or I take these tests, I can feel him present with me in all the
[719.08 --> 728.10]  hardship of cancer. God shows up. The suffering servant who knows our weakness, who knows our pain,
[728.50 --> 733.58]  is present. And I have a hunch that many of you know exactly what I'm talking about because you've been
[733.58 --> 738.82]  there. You know what it's like? The bottom fall out. You're at your worst. And there, Jesus mysteriously,
[739.00 --> 744.92]  powerfully shows up and says, my grace is sufficient. I will walk with you. I will be with you. I will
[744.92 --> 753.30]  reveal to you who I am in your weakness. That's what we're hearing. The suffering servant knows our pain.
[755.32 --> 760.74]  But here's something that I think is the challenge. And if you're healthy and able-bodied, this is what I
[760.74 --> 765.58]  think is the real challenge of this passage. You ready for it? It's the challenge of self-sufficiency.
[767.00 --> 772.90]  Paul realizes that he is prone to being conceited. He is prone to allowing some things to get to his
[772.90 --> 778.00]  head. And as one writer puts it, God would not let Paul do that. God would not let Paul become
[778.00 --> 787.32]  self-assertive, self-dependent, self-satisfied, and self-glorifying. Jesus in his power wanted to use
[787.32 --> 791.10]  Paul, but he didn't want Paul to put the microphone or the spotlight on himself. He wanted Paul to
[791.10 --> 797.36]  demonstrate and proclaim and make known Jesus. Paul had to learn through this weakness, through this
[797.36 --> 801.32]  thorn in the flesh, how to get out of the way and let Jesus receive the glory and the honor for his
[801.32 --> 808.84]  life and his ministry. What a word to pastors, by the way. He needed to learn the hard way of weakness
[808.84 --> 814.60]  and discover in that weakness the sufficiency of Jesus. Now, here's the thing. If you're young and
[814.60 --> 818.52]  healthy and you don't have any pain in your body, you don't like this teaching. I certainly don't
[818.52 --> 823.70]  think this is a beautiful, I don't think it's an easy teaching. But here's the thing. You might not
[823.70 --> 828.86]  like the idea that God will allow you to experience weakness in order to know his sufficiency. But
[828.86 --> 836.48]  here's the flip side. You may never know the depth of the sufficiency of Jesus until you are weakened.
[837.86 --> 844.00]  Did you hear that? You may never know the riches of Jesus' provision, the presence of his spirit,
[844.00 --> 850.88]  the way in which he carries your life because he is so good until you can't carry your life.
[851.82 --> 857.76]  Are you hearing me? You know, I think for many of us, we can look around and we see other people
[857.76 --> 861.66]  around us and we compare ourselves and we see those people who are really competent, right? We all have
[861.66 --> 865.62]  those people in our lives who are like, man, they're just crushing it. They're competent, they're healthy,
[865.74 --> 869.48]  they're strong, they lead well, their family seems so put together, everything's just good. And what you
[869.48 --> 878.22]  might not see is behind that picture of competence is a very self-sufficient human being who loves being
[878.22 --> 882.24]  in control, who loves having all the shots, who loves being the one who determines what's going on. And really
[882.24 --> 889.04]  at the end of the day, their life for them is about them. And what they don't know, and that day will come,
[889.04 --> 896.06]  where their strength will diminish, their muscle mass will diminish, their competence and their
[896.06 --> 901.52]  capacities will diminish. And the question we need to ask is, who will they be then?
[903.18 --> 907.62]  You know, just yesterday, I was in the hospital with Nell and Pete Vulcanier, and if you're wondering,
[908.34 --> 914.50]  Pete is near the end, so hold them in prayer. But sitting in the hospital room with Nell and Pete and just
[914.50 --> 921.38]  seeing him at the end, sort of breathing with the assistance of a machine, and knowing that this
[921.38 --> 926.52]  guy was once like a very competent teacher and principal. He was respected by so many people
[926.52 --> 931.20]  in our community. He was actually the teacher of many people in our community. He was so competent.
[932.30 --> 938.82]  And now he's being held by a breathing machine. But here's the beautiful thing. Pete's life doesn't
[938.82 --> 943.22]  depend right now on Pete's competence. It doesn't depend on what Pete can do for himself, because Pete,
[943.22 --> 948.72]  his whole life, has lived for Jesus. He has found his sufficiency, his identity, his power in Jesus.
[948.72 --> 956.10]  And Jesus now holds Pete through life, through death, into resurrection. And Jesus is sufficient
[956.10 --> 965.60]  for Pete. We may never know the riches of Jesus' sufficiency, his grace and power, until we are weakened.
[966.66 --> 973.06]  We may not like that, but we discover the power of Christ in the basement when we can't carry
[973.06 --> 982.98]  our own lives. My grace is sufficient for you. My power is made perfect in weakness. Paul's answer
[982.98 --> 988.36]  to what makes you who you are and what you can do is Jesus. And in some sense, this teaching brings us
[988.36 --> 992.72]  right to the center of the Christian faith, don't you think? Because what's at the center? Jesus is at
[992.72 --> 996.70]  the center of the Christian faith, the one who is with the Father through all eternity, one with the
[996.70 --> 1003.52]  Father and the Spirit before creation. And what does Jesus do? He's sent by the Father to take on flesh.
[1004.70 --> 1012.10]  Philippians 2 says he humbled himself and took the position of a slave. He emptied himself. And at the
[1012.10 --> 1019.10]  moment that turned all of history around, Jesus was hanging naked, humiliated, and weak from a cross.
[1019.10 --> 1025.56]  It's so humiliating that people could even look at Jesus in this state. It was despicable that someone
[1025.56 --> 1030.76]  would die in this way. And yet God says, that's the moment where I will reverse sin. I will undo its
[1030.76 --> 1039.04]  power. Well, I will show Satan my power over him and I will overcome death itself. God works through
[1039.04 --> 1047.04]  weakness to accomplish his purposes. And Paul knows that about the cross. He knows that about Jesus. And what
[1047.04 --> 1053.58]  Paul is learning is that Jesus, who is a suffering servant, is not only sufficient in Paul's suffering,
[1054.58 --> 1060.68]  but he will sustain and use him to exalt the name of Jesus in his life.
[1063.48 --> 1069.98]  And just so we get the movement of this passage clear, Paul is saying, I've been humbled from becoming
[1069.98 --> 1076.50]  conceited by this thorn in the flesh. God has allowed me to have it. And the reason for that
[1076.50 --> 1084.66]  is so that I can boast not in myself, but in him. Paul is allowing this thorn in the flesh to get him
[1084.66 --> 1090.18]  out of the way so people can see through his life the person of Jesus Christ. Paul is learning what all
[1090.18 --> 1097.34]  of us have to learn in some sense, and that we are not supposed to live for us. We are not the center
[1097.34 --> 1102.92]  of the world. Our short and small lives are not meant to be lived for us. And this weakness that Paul
[1102.92 --> 1110.88]  is experiencing is allowing him to say, life, my life, is lived for Jesus. And this weakness is allowing me to say,
[1111.12 --> 1119.04]  he must become greater, and I must become less. Are you hearing this? And it's worth asking the question,
[1119.12 --> 1126.52]  whatever you are going through, what might the Lord be trying to teach me about what life is about as I struggle
[1126.52 --> 1133.00]  with this weakness, this pain, this illness? And it seems to me, I mean, I could talk a lot about this,
[1133.66 --> 1138.68]  but those of us who grow up in Canada are born and bred in a culture that breeds self-sufficiency.
[1139.48 --> 1142.60]  It tells us from our earliest years, you've got to figure this out for yourself. You've got to call
[1142.60 --> 1146.70]  the shots. You've got to take control. You've got to assert your competence. And you need to let other
[1146.70 --> 1151.72]  people know what you can do, how smart you are, how high you can rise in the company, what titles you can
[1151.72 --> 1156.08]  serve. And the person with the most stuff, the most money, and the most competence, they win at the end
[1156.08 --> 1162.42]  of life, according to Western society. And what is needed is a church that says, we call that bluff.
[1163.28 --> 1168.42]  That's not why we live. That's not who we are. And in the end, we will be stripped of all our
[1168.42 --> 1173.16]  self-sufficiency. And what we will learn then is what life is really about. And what we learn in this
[1173.16 --> 1181.10]  passage, it is about glorifying Jesus Christ, who is our life. The Jesus who in his grace says,
[1181.10 --> 1186.56]  I will die for you. I will take your sin. I will bring you into my family so that you can experience
[1186.56 --> 1192.90]  the fullness of life. And that's found in me. And I will then make your life about bearing witness to
[1192.90 --> 1198.92]  the goodness of Christ, the power of his resurrection in your families, your workplaces,
[1199.18 --> 1205.32]  your marriages, your children, your neighborhoods. The church gets to be the community that says to the
[1205.32 --> 1212.84]  world, life is not about us. And it is sustained by the person of Jesus Christ, who holds us in our
[1212.84 --> 1217.50]  life, who is sufficient in our weakness, and carries us through death and resurrection.
[1220.60 --> 1225.30]  I want to finish with a story about a woman named Marva Dawn. Has anyone ever heard of Marva Dawn?
[1226.18 --> 1231.44]  Oh, a couple people did. Marva Dawn, I first discovered her writing when I was in university.
[1231.44 --> 1236.28]  She writes on worship, very deep, profound things. In fact, her book on worship, I just love this title,
[1236.36 --> 1241.78]  it's called A Royal Waste of Time. So what we're doing this morning is it's a royal waste of time
[1241.78 --> 1248.80]  in the presence of King Jesus. But Marva was a professor at Regent College, and she actually
[1248.80 --> 1253.90]  passed away over COVID in April of 2021. And I didn't know a lot about her personally until I took a
[1253.90 --> 1258.92]  class with her at Regent. And that's when I learned a lot of her own personal story. See, in this picture,
[1258.92 --> 1264.28]  you see her face, but she's someone who, if you would see her at Regent College, she was in a
[1264.28 --> 1268.12]  wheelchair. And I'll just list some of the things that she battled with for most of her life.
[1268.90 --> 1275.34]  She battled with cancer, chronic pain, blindness in one eye, she had a kidney transplant, and a
[1275.34 --> 1279.16]  problem with one of her feet that made walking nearly impossible. And so most of the time she
[1279.16 --> 1284.30]  would move around in a wheelchair. And what we all remember about Marva Dawn at Regent is that smile.
[1284.30 --> 1289.20]  She was incredibly joyful. And when she taught, she was a meek woman who spoke with such boldness
[1289.20 --> 1293.80]  and confidence about the person of Jesus. And I think she had such a ministry to young, healthy
[1293.80 --> 1298.26]  students who knew nothing of suffering, for the most part, about the hardship of life and the goodness
[1298.26 --> 1303.44]  of Christ in the midst of it. And I can remember her talking in class about what she called her
[1303.44 --> 1308.30]  defunct body. That's how she described her body. Just didn't do what she wanted to do, and medication
[1308.30 --> 1312.18]  seemed to conflict with other medication. She and her husband were always trying to find a comfortable
[1312.18 --> 1318.22]  position just so she could sit without pain. But she talked so often about the goodness of Christ,
[1318.96 --> 1324.06]  his daily provision, the way he walked with her. And she was so open-handed about what she could do,
[1324.14 --> 1328.04]  a book she might write, or the fact that she might die young and trust that God is going to bring
[1328.04 --> 1332.64]  someone else to write about that, speak about that, teach about that. She just lived so open-handedly
[1332.64 --> 1337.70]  with her whole life, probably because she knew that she would not live as long as most able-bodied
[1337.70 --> 1345.74]  people. But what I remember the most about Marva Dawn, said from a wheelchair, was the words of hope
[1345.74 --> 1352.22]  about our future in Jesus. She often talked about Jesus' return, the kingdom that is coming when Christ
[1352.22 --> 1358.76]  heals all things. And she says, this is a quote, when Jesus returns, she says, I'm going to get a new body.
[1358.76 --> 1368.78]  And when Jesus returns, I am going to run. I'm going to get up on my legs. I'm going to run.
[1369.56 --> 1373.40]  She had this hope for the future that Jesus, who holds her life, whose grace is sufficient,
[1373.64 --> 1378.36]  is going to bring her to a new creation, and he is going to give her a new body to enjoy forever.
[1379.78 --> 1384.56]  And that's true for all of us who live and seek to follow Jesus.
[1384.56 --> 1389.48]  And maybe there's going to be this scene when Jesus returns, where we get to take whatever
[1389.48 --> 1394.18]  those ailments are, whatever those aids that we walk with are, and we get to throw them in a pile,
[1394.28 --> 1397.82]  because they're no longer necessary, right? We bring the wheelchair over, we say, well,
[1397.90 --> 1401.70]  we don't need that anymore. We don't need to be in that wheelchair. Get the crutches over there,
[1401.78 --> 1406.90]  or Chuck's walking cane. Put that in the pile. Put the hearing aids, put the medication,
[1406.90 --> 1413.34]  all the stuff that gets us along as we limp in a world full of pain. That gets done away with
[1413.34 --> 1421.84]  a new creation, and we get new bodies, new strength, new vitality to live with in the
[1421.84 --> 1428.68]  presence of Jesus in a healed creation forever. Marvedon's life was a testimony to not just
[1428.68 --> 1434.30]  the sufficiency of Jesus, day to day, his grace meeting her in pain, but the promise of Jesus
[1434.30 --> 1438.38]  that the one who defeated death on the cross, the one who defeated Satan on the cross, was
[1438.38 --> 1446.04]  the one who promised future resurrection for the world and for his people. My grace is sufficient
[1446.04 --> 1461.30]  for you. Do you believe it? My power is made perfect in weakness. Do you believe it? Let me finish
[1461.30 --> 1467.76]  with the words from Jesus in John 16, 33. Church of Jesus, in this world you will have trouble.
[1469.14 --> 1474.74]  You'll have pain. You'll have all sorts of frustrations with your body that you wished you never had.
[1475.36 --> 1483.70]  But Jesus' word to the church now and forever is, take heart. I have overcome the world. Amen.
[1483.70 --> 1490.58]  I want to read a prayer that Marvedon wrote in her book on death and dying. So would you join me in this prayer?
[1490.58 --> 1504.08]  Watch, O Lord, with those who wake or watch or weep today. Tend your sick ones, O Lord Christ.
[1505.02 --> 1515.42]  Rest your weary ones. Bless your dying ones. Soothe your suffering ones. Take pity on your afflicted
[1515.42 --> 1522.60]  ones and shield your joyous ones. And all for your love's sake. Amen.
[1524.68 --> 1528.32]  I invite you to stand and sing with me a very fitting song of response,
[1528.46 --> 1532.24]  Yet Not I, But Christ Through Me. Let's stand as we worship together.
