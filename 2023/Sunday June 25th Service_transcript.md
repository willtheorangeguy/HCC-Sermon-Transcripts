[0.00 --> 6.30]  Good morning, Hope.
[14.30 --> 22.72]  Today being Volunteer Appreciation Sunday reminded me how precious serving and answering
[22.72 --> 28.56]  our calls to love one another through our servanthood, following the example of Jesus
[28.56 --> 30.86]  is very important for the life of the church.
[31.06 --> 35.48]  And so once again, I thank you on behalf of the church and leadership.
[37.42 --> 40.92]  Yeah, and one big ministry is prayer.
[41.68 --> 45.90]  And so the power of prayer is real.
[46.54 --> 51.16]  And so we pray for Tyler and we pray as a community, whether you know him very well or not.
[51.16 --> 52.16]  I personally don't.
[52.16 --> 59.10]  But we're here together and we reflect God's kingdom as we comfort and reflect God's love
[59.10 --> 59.88]  and care.
[60.56 --> 61.92]  And so that's our prayer this morning.
[62.48 --> 69.92]  As we go into reflecting on our identity, further into our Beatitudes, we are looking at the
[69.92 --> 70.84]  fourth Beatitude.
[71.46 --> 76.48]  And so I invite you to be blessed as you hear Jesus' words that I will read for us.
[76.48 --> 79.74]  And so this is the word of the Lord.
[80.62 --> 86.20]  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
[88.20 --> 94.02]  I would like to paraphrase this so that it's more, it's a little more applicable personally
[94.02 --> 94.58]  to us.
[94.98 --> 103.28]  In other words, paraphrase, blessed, congratulations to you who share a divine, God-sized craving
[103.28 --> 108.48]  for righteousness, for you and only you will be satisfied.
[109.02 --> 109.90]  That is our blessing.
[111.82 --> 118.98]  And so can you think of a time when you were so hungry or you were so thirsty for something
[118.98 --> 121.18]  that you felt like you were going to die?
[122.82 --> 129.04]  This craving that Jesus blesses here in our Beatitude is not some simple craving that you
[129.04 --> 133.66]  have, like maybe when you see a pizza ad on TV and you go, oh, now I'm hungry.
[133.98 --> 136.78]  I would like a really good cheesy pizza or something.
[137.38 --> 140.02]  That's not the simple craving that Jesus is talking about.
[140.20 --> 146.86]  It's something that's so desperate and so deep in our souls that we feel like we would die
[146.86 --> 147.66]  without this.
[148.34 --> 153.88]  And so when was the last time you had some sort of hunger or thirst like this?
[153.88 --> 160.10]  That's part of the reason we fast, to reflect this sort of desperation for God.
[160.58 --> 166.00]  For me, I actually, the movie actually popped into my head as I was reflecting on this Beatitude,
[166.26 --> 169.66]  really hungering and thirsting for something, desperate for something.
[169.96 --> 172.38]  And the movie 127 Hours came to mind.
[172.78 --> 177.76]  I don't know if you've seen it, but it's based on a real life story of a hiker who gets
[177.76 --> 182.68]  his hand stuck between boulders, a boulder, that boulder there in the poster, not that
[182.68 --> 185.44]  actual one, falls on his hand and he gets stuck.
[186.50 --> 188.16]  Can you guess how long he was stuck there for?
[189.14 --> 189.40]  Yeah.
[190.16 --> 196.10]  And so the movie of this real life event is a roughly 90 minute movie.
[196.30 --> 201.66]  And for the most part of the movie, it depicts the struggles that this hiker goes through
[201.66 --> 206.32]  as he runs out of food, water supply and resources to live.
[207.50 --> 214.46]  And I think the movie does a really good job of showing to what lengths humans would go
[214.46 --> 217.86]  in their desperation for life to stay living.
[218.76 --> 224.10]  And if you know this story, or if you've watched the movie, you know that out of this deep,
[224.10 --> 231.64]  deep desire to live, and also deep desperation and hope, because apparently in his desperation,
[231.66 --> 233.20]  he saw visions.
[233.98 --> 237.64]  And he was hallucinating a lot, but he saw a vision of his future son.
[238.32 --> 242.90]  And it sparked hope in him to survive, to not just give up.
[243.32 --> 248.06]  And so out of that, if you know the story, it's a little bit gruesome, but he performs
[248.06 --> 250.60]  amputation on his own arm and he ends up surviving.
[250.94 --> 251.78]  A real life story.
[251.78 --> 259.12]  And what Jesus says is that for those who are in sync with God's will, who are aligned with
[259.12 --> 262.96]  God's kingdom living, share this kind of desperation.
[263.48 --> 267.86]  But the desperation is for righteousness that we will look at.
[268.12 --> 268.82]  Righteousness.
[268.98 --> 269.82]  We're hungry.
[270.22 --> 271.26]  We crave.
[271.68 --> 273.38]  We desperately want righteousness.
[274.04 --> 276.82]  And so here's the main focus of today's Beatitude for us.
[277.20 --> 280.52]  To be a blessed people is to share God's heart.
[280.86 --> 283.20]  We've said this many times during our Beatitude series.
[283.20 --> 285.60]  We share God's heart.
[286.36 --> 291.64]  And part of God's heart is to see the restoration of that righteousness.
[292.52 --> 298.80]  And out of God's grace for us now, and him living through his Holy Spirit, his presence
[298.80 --> 306.30]  in our lives, we get to share his heart for meekness, for purity, for mercifulness, and
[306.30 --> 309.98]  today specifically, a craving for righteousness.
[309.98 --> 317.60]  And so simply put, God's work of restoration for all creation and ourselves is to restore
[317.60 --> 323.00]  that deep desire, that desperate hungering and thirsting for righteousness, which in its
[323.00 --> 326.46]  core means shalom relationship.
[327.54 --> 328.62]  Shalom relationship.
[328.76 --> 331.90]  I'm going to use this word, this terminology a lot today.
[332.32 --> 337.62]  The good news is that out of God's grace, through the sacrifice of his one and only son on the
[337.62 --> 343.56]  cross, and now by his Holy Spirit, we get to share in this deep desire for righteousness.
[345.36 --> 347.22]  That shalom relationship.
[347.70 --> 352.98]  Now, these Beatitude kingdom qualities, whether it be meekness, purity, all those good things,
[353.24 --> 361.26]  these kingdom qualities are not natural to our being, not natural to our humanity, in the
[361.26 --> 363.40]  sense that we are sinful.
[364.40 --> 370.18]  In our broken selves, these kingdom qualities that are supposed to be upright seem to be
[370.18 --> 371.52]  upside down for us.
[371.94 --> 380.10]  We don't understand why is Jesus blessing those that are meek, that are gentle, that are humble,
[380.52 --> 381.44]  that are merciful.
[381.44 --> 386.96]  For us, in our sinful nature, it goes against our natures.
[387.30 --> 393.60]  But Jesus is saying he blesses those who crave that righteousness because we know that in
[393.60 --> 402.30]  our naturally created beings in God's image, we did desire and we did hunger for that righteousness,
[402.86 --> 403.92]  that right relationship.
[403.92 --> 413.10]  And ironically, the gospel is telling us that the more we become aware of our sin, the more
[413.10 --> 419.86]  we become aware that we are all broken, the more we start sharing God's heart because we
[419.86 --> 422.34]  want that brokenness to be restored.
[423.92 --> 428.14]  We know that it is not how it's supposed to be right now.
[428.14 --> 434.42]  In all the brokenness that we face, even within the church, we know this is not the way it's
[434.42 --> 435.26]  supposed to be.
[435.64 --> 440.34]  And the more we get to know that, we say, Lord, this is not the way it's supposed to
[440.34 --> 440.44]  be.
[440.52 --> 441.70]  We want restoration.
[442.34 --> 443.38]  We want shalom.
[444.12 --> 447.60]  That's why shalom is a key word for us today.
[449.38 --> 452.58]  Blessed are those who deeply desire shalom relationship.
[452.58 --> 458.56]  And Pastor Jim, a few weeks ago, emphasized this word, righteousness, which comes from
[458.56 --> 459.66]  the Hebrew word tzedakah.
[460.60 --> 467.42]  This Hebrew word includes the connotation of justice because we long to see things made
[467.42 --> 467.98]  right again.
[469.04 --> 471.64]  And that's the shalom relationship that's written there.
[472.54 --> 476.86]  I'm using the Hebrew word shalom because in the English translation, it doesn't do it justice.
[477.22 --> 478.46]  Shalom, peace.
[478.46 --> 487.86]  It's not just peace or an absence of violence that fully captures righteousness, that shalom
[487.86 --> 488.48]  relationship.
[488.96 --> 497.20]  Shalom and shalom relationship means a restored, harmonious, loving, godly, perfect, complete,
[497.68 --> 501.70]  in sync, in sync with God's will, pure relationship.
[503.24 --> 505.22]  That's shalom relationship.
[505.22 --> 510.94]  And so righteousness captures the essence of God's heart again, God's will, and his
[510.94 --> 513.54]  will of wanting that sort of relationship being restored.
[514.06 --> 520.44]  God hungers and thirsts for that, as the psalmist says to God as he prays, Lord, righteousness
[520.44 --> 523.08]  and justice are the foundation of your throne.
[523.68 --> 526.26]  Love and faithfulness go before you.
[527.00 --> 528.12]  That's God's heart.
[528.12 --> 534.82]  And Jesus being the Son of God, following his beatitudes, the blessings that we are looking
[534.82 --> 537.92]  at, Jesus preaches the famous Sermon on the Mount.
[538.52 --> 544.26]  One of the main central core messages of the whole Sermon on the Mount is captured in Matthew
[544.26 --> 546.28]  520, where Jesus says,
[547.06 --> 554.48]  For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers
[554.48 --> 557.86]  of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[559.90 --> 565.26]  Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,
[566.16 --> 571.26]  who are so, at least outwardly, so holy and righteous.
[571.26 --> 581.20]  And so for God, it is clear that God wants to share his heart and his deep desire for righteousness,
[581.84 --> 582.58]  the right one.
[583.46 --> 591.36]  And by his grace, he causes his kingdom, his reign to break into our lives, which results
[591.36 --> 600.20]  in us beginning to crave that longing for righteousness, that restoration, sharing God's heart, a God-sized
[600.20 --> 600.60]  craving.
[600.60 --> 606.58]  And so, at this point, when I keep emphasizing that righteousness is shalom relationship,
[607.22 --> 612.92]  I think it's fair to ask the question, why do you simply, Jonathan, why do you simply
[612.92 --> 615.76]  equate righteousness to shalom relationship?
[616.22 --> 618.10]  That's actually a question that my wife asked me.
[618.58 --> 621.32]  Is it not an oversimplification?
[622.22 --> 625.92]  What's the biblical definition of righteousness then?
[625.92 --> 632.82]  And as I attempt to answer my own question here, I felt that it would be effective to communicate
[632.82 --> 638.80]  how righteousness was wrongly perceived and wrongly interpreted by the Jewish leaders,
[639.66 --> 643.66]  the Pharisees and the teachers of the law that Jesus mentions in Matthew 520.
[643.66 --> 649.56]  In a sermon on the mount, your righteousness has to surpass that of the Pharisees and the teachers
[649.56 --> 650.02]  of the law.
[650.02 --> 656.66]  So, what was the idea of righteousness that these Pharisees and these teachers of the law were
[656.66 --> 657.22]  thinking about?
[657.50 --> 658.70]  How did they perceive it?
[659.26 --> 662.58]  They are the essential part of the audience that Jesus is preaching to.
[662.92 --> 665.24]  So, what did they think righteousness was?
[665.24 --> 671.64]  Before we get to them, even in the Old Testament, more than half of our book, by the way, the Old
[671.64 --> 678.70]  Testament, the prophets also were speaking against the Israelites who had false, wrong ideas of
[678.70 --> 680.46]  what righteousness was supposed to be.
[681.74 --> 686.88]  And so, you see, these Pharisees and all the Jewish leaders were trying to be faithful to God.
[687.74 --> 692.10]  It wasn't their mission to go out and say, okay, God's direction is that way.
[692.40 --> 693.96]  All right, everyone, we're going that way.
[693.96 --> 696.28]  That was not their intention.
[697.44 --> 702.04]  In their mind, they thought they were trying to be faithful to God's Word.
[702.58 --> 708.72]  They thought, okay, here's the definition of righteousness, and we're going to try our best to keep it that way.
[709.56 --> 710.96]  It was out of their intent.
[712.00 --> 713.72]  But they missed the mark, didn't they?
[714.68 --> 716.48]  We sometimes miss the mark.
[718.46 --> 722.72]  What's a biblical term that has a definition of missing the mark?
[723.96 --> 726.28]  I heard some s's.
[726.98 --> 727.46]  Sin.
[727.94 --> 729.02]  Yes, exactly.
[729.58 --> 730.14]  Hamartia.
[730.42 --> 731.68]  It is to miss the mark.
[731.68 --> 749.58]  And so, like the Old Testament cycle, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law failed to see the heart of God and simply took the letter of the law, almost literally, and tried to satisfy their own thinking of what righteousness means.
[749.58 --> 752.96]  Religious beliefs and check boxes and say, okay, I've done that.
[752.96 --> 753.52]  I'm good.
[753.72 --> 754.48]  Now I'm good enough.
[754.84 --> 756.08]  Now I am righteous.
[757.14 --> 758.32]  That was their definition.
[759.04 --> 764.66]  And so, in Hosea, in one of the prophets, God outrightly rejects His own people.
[764.66 --> 772.80]  And He says, for I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and an acknowledgement of me rather than burnt offerings.
[773.08 --> 775.18]  It is relational in its essence.
[775.66 --> 782.26]  God is not looking for us to just check off religious boxes and say, all right, now I am a Christian.
[782.70 --> 784.04]  Now I am righteous.
[784.04 --> 790.00]  God saying, the heart of it is shalom relationship.
[790.34 --> 791.72]  Do you long for shalom?
[792.04 --> 796.36]  Do you see the brokenness and the sin and the pollution, as Pastor Jim said?
[796.56 --> 797.22]  Love that word.
[797.64 --> 798.42]  It is tainted.
[798.82 --> 802.38]  Our idea of righteousness, shalom, is tainted.
[804.14 --> 809.94]  But do you now long to see God's restoration happen because we know we are all broken?
[809.94 --> 814.24]  Take another example.
[814.92 --> 815.78]  The Ten Commandments.
[816.52 --> 823.38]  Being good Christians, being good Sunday school Christians, if somebody were to ask you, how does the Ten Commandments start?
[823.84 --> 825.06]  What is the first commandment?
[825.14 --> 825.80]  How does it start?
[826.32 --> 826.94]  What do you say?
[827.14 --> 827.76]  What's the answer?
[831.50 --> 832.54]  You're worrying me here.
[833.38 --> 834.86]  It was Sunday school, right?
[834.94 --> 836.82]  I know it's a while back, but the first one.
[836.82 --> 840.12]  You shall not have any other gods before me.
[840.14 --> 840.58]  Is that correct?
[841.50 --> 842.84]  Or is it honor your father and mother?
[843.98 --> 844.38]  No, no, no.
[844.38 --> 845.24]  The first one is right, right?
[847.64 --> 848.48]  You're all wrong.
[849.02 --> 850.62]  That is not the first commandment.
[850.80 --> 853.36]  That's not how it starts, I should say.
[854.20 --> 857.30]  The way the commandments start is not you shall have no.
[857.80 --> 864.22]  The way the commandments start is a declaration of the relationship between God and His people.
[866.82 --> 871.50]  God says before He gives the first commandment, I am Yahweh.
[872.36 --> 875.98]  This is His personal relational name.
[876.96 --> 879.90]  He declares to His people, I am your God.
[880.34 --> 885.56]  I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
[886.24 --> 889.16]  You and I, we're in a shalom relationship.
[890.08 --> 890.96]  That's what we are.
[890.96 --> 897.08]  And then, following it, the Ten Commandments then are a picture.
[897.72 --> 905.62]  It's a picture of that shalom relationship that was brought about by God's work of salvation, by God's grace.
[905.62 --> 915.10]  It is out of His grace that we are invited, called into a shalom relationship.
[916.98 --> 927.80]  And so, at the heart of righteousness, again, is shalom relationship with God, with one another, with ourselves, and with the rest of creation.
[928.56 --> 931.70]  Scholars call this the fourfold relationship.
[931.70 --> 940.46]  Relationship with God, with one another, and because we're sinners, it is hard to even love ourselves, believe it or not.
[941.40 --> 943.34]  And with the rest of creation.
[943.70 --> 952.12]  And so, today's blessing is for those who know that all of these relationships, all four of these fourfold relationships, they're all broken.
[952.12 --> 957.62]  All relationships are tainted and twisted and polluted with sin and brokenness.
[957.96 --> 966.02]  And as God captures us with His grace and His gospel message of the kingdom, we get to know of this brokenness more and more.
[966.44 --> 970.98]  And then we long more and more for those to make it right again.
[971.54 --> 977.22]  For that relationship to be restored again into the shalom that God hungers for.
[977.22 --> 980.08]  And He says, share that heart with me.
[980.74 --> 982.68]  Do you long to see shalom again?
[983.06 --> 988.20]  Do you long to see the restoration of broken relationships that are even within our churches?
[990.20 --> 993.14]  Do you want to see shalom?
[993.14 --> 1004.10]  And so, this righteousness is not simply about keeping legalistic codes.
[1005.78 --> 1011.50]  The laws and legalistic codes, Scripture itself is not bad.
[1012.38 --> 1014.34]  It is a gift to us.
[1014.34 --> 1018.26]  It is supposed to be the picture of that relationship.
[1018.86 --> 1025.60]  And it is a guideline to help us reflect His kingdom living because of all the brokenness that we face.
[1026.06 --> 1028.98]  It's a guideline against our sinful natures.
[1029.48 --> 1038.44]  As Paul says in Galatians, he says when he talks about the acts of the flesh, acts of sin, our sinful nature that we face.
[1038.96 --> 1041.62]  These are obvious things and he lists them.
[1041.62 --> 1057.98]  Sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy, drunkenness, orgies and the like.
[1057.98 --> 1064.88]  I tell you, I warn you as I did before, that those who live like this shall not inherit God's kingdom.
[1067.64 --> 1070.20]  Acts of the flesh, acts of sin.
[1070.20 --> 1079.08]  And if you notice, if you stop to think about this whole list that Paul lists, and there are similar lists in a lot of his letters to the churches.
[1080.20 --> 1082.62]  The core of all these sins, you know what it is?
[1083.32 --> 1087.16]  All these things are things that break apart relationships.
[1088.66 --> 1089.42]  All of them.
[1089.98 --> 1095.28]  Whether it be relationship with God, with one another, with ourselves, or with the rest of creation.
[1095.74 --> 1098.26]  These things are things that break those relationships.
[1098.26 --> 1101.14]  It goes against that shalom relationship.
[1101.48 --> 1109.02]  And so, Scripture was given, was gifted to us as a guide to teach us that is brokenness.
[1109.18 --> 1110.44]  That is sin.
[1110.76 --> 1113.18]  Without this, we wouldn't even know that we were sinning.
[1114.46 --> 1115.72]  That's what Paul says.
[1116.64 --> 1117.96]  What is the Bible for?
[1118.14 --> 1119.78]  What is Scripture given to us for?
[1119.78 --> 1123.18]  To teach us, to teach us that we are broken.
[1123.66 --> 1132.02]  But also to give us that truth of the gospel that we are broken, but we have hope in restoration through the work of Christ.
[1132.26 --> 1133.02]  And it is done.
[1134.30 --> 1136.22]  It is done already.
[1137.86 --> 1139.24]  And we get to live in hope of that.
[1139.24 --> 1143.08]  And so, lean into it.
[1143.14 --> 1144.38]  That's the encouragement for us.
[1144.70 --> 1145.88]  Lean into God's Word.
[1146.00 --> 1147.06]  This precious Word.
[1147.44 --> 1148.60]  A gift from God.
[1149.12 --> 1150.98]  That guides us against our sins.
[1151.40 --> 1153.86]  And maybe if you rely on this enough.
[1154.08 --> 1155.22]  And I'm guilty of myself.
[1155.74 --> 1156.18]  Myself.
[1156.66 --> 1158.30]  A lot of our youngins.
[1158.30 --> 1167.42]  They think that reading a few verses on Instagram or some memes that pop up and teach us some great Christian messages that are apparently from the Bible.
[1167.64 --> 1168.38]  That is enough.
[1169.44 --> 1175.02]  I know enough now because I've seen enough Instagram posts that are Christian.
[1175.54 --> 1179.58]  Or, in my case, I've read enough theology books in my life.
[1180.10 --> 1181.54]  I don't need this thing.
[1181.54 --> 1188.16]  I need all those interpretations that take this and teach me with a whole bunch of scholarly things.
[1188.30 --> 1189.76]  So, I don't need God's Bible.
[1190.12 --> 1191.54]  I need theology textbooks.
[1193.54 --> 1197.26]  But this itself is the core of our faith.
[1197.98 --> 1199.84]  It is a gift given to us.
[1200.70 --> 1201.02]  This.
[1203.40 --> 1208.18]  And I know at least of one young adult who has recently come to faith in Christ.
[1208.18 --> 1209.38]  A new believer.
[1209.84 --> 1210.80]  Who know.
[1211.14 --> 1211.90]  Who I know.
[1212.90 --> 1216.74]  That this Word of God is so precious and dear to him.
[1218.30 --> 1223.42]  I think he can sympathize with this psalmist when this psalmist says,
[1224.22 --> 1226.30]  How sweet are your words to my taste.
[1226.84 --> 1227.32]  Sweeter.
[1227.72 --> 1229.38]  Sweeter than honey to my mouth.
[1231.66 --> 1232.38]  God's Word.
[1234.06 --> 1236.64]  And going back to Paul's exhortation.
[1236.78 --> 1240.26]  So, he lists a whole bunch of sins that break apart relationship.
[1240.46 --> 1241.22]  But he goes on.
[1241.26 --> 1242.12]  He doesn't stop there.
[1242.12 --> 1245.66]  He goes on and he lists the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[1247.16 --> 1255.20]  The fruit of the Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness that we looked at last week.
[1255.32 --> 1256.58]  Gentleness and self-control.
[1257.08 --> 1260.42]  Against such things there is no law.
[1260.42 --> 1265.30]  You don't need laws for love.
[1265.98 --> 1267.00]  These are fruits.
[1267.42 --> 1273.74]  These are things that the Holy Spirit allows us and gives us the freedom to express and to live into.
[1274.30 --> 1276.14]  And so, thinking about the volunteers this morning.
[1276.40 --> 1279.06]  The way we serve one another here at Hope Community Church.
[1279.50 --> 1281.18]  You don't need laws for that.
[1281.62 --> 1283.46]  You don't need the Bible telling you,
[1283.74 --> 1284.92]  You have to serve.
[1285.04 --> 1285.88]  You have to love.
[1286.08 --> 1287.06]  You have to be patient.
[1287.56 --> 1288.48]  Check off that box.
[1288.62 --> 1289.52]  Oh, now you're righteous.
[1289.52 --> 1291.68]  You don't need laws for that.
[1292.04 --> 1300.34]  We have the Holy Spirit that is encouraging us, that is who is empowering us, equipping us to serve one another.
[1300.54 --> 1304.88]  And as we do serve one another, we're more equipped together to now what?
[1305.62 --> 1307.44]  To be a light for the world.
[1308.36 --> 1309.78]  To be a light for the community.
[1309.98 --> 1313.22]  To serve out there, not just stay here.
[1314.72 --> 1317.84]  And so, imagine we don't have these fruits within our church.
[1319.52 --> 1325.16]  Then we can't even think about going out there and blessing the community and our world.
[1325.70 --> 1327.22]  It's a four-fold relationship.
[1327.60 --> 1333.20]  It's a relationship with God, with one another here, with ourselves, and also with the rest of creation.
[1333.88 --> 1335.00]  That is our mandate.
[1335.10 --> 1335.82]  It is our mission.
[1336.04 --> 1340.88]  And you can stop here and say,
[1340.88 --> 1345.74]  Jonathan, big mouth, preacher, easier said than done.
[1346.76 --> 1348.32]  Easier said than done.
[1348.76 --> 1349.46]  That's hard to say.
[1350.98 --> 1352.80]  Obviously, it's easier said than done.
[1353.18 --> 1357.32]  Obviously, it's easy for me to be up here and just preach the gospel to you and say,
[1357.42 --> 1358.96]  All right, now we need to serve one another.
[1359.30 --> 1362.94]  Now we need to hunger and thirst for righteousness and that shalom relationship.
[1363.38 --> 1364.32]  Easier said than done.
[1364.32 --> 1365.00]  Why?
[1365.36 --> 1369.98]  Because we're a gathering, a church is a gathering of broken sinners who come together.
[1370.16 --> 1374.98]  We're not all holy people who are now perfect and everything is set.
[1375.48 --> 1382.08]  We're broken people coming into broken relationships and trying and desperately wanting restoration to happen.
[1383.62 --> 1385.52]  And that's why it's easier said than done.
[1385.52 --> 1393.96]  And so as you face the struggles of brokenness in your life, whoever, whatever, wherever comes to mind for you,
[1394.00 --> 1397.18]  when you think of sin and brokenness and our shortcomings,
[1398.08 --> 1403.56]  the encouragement is to pray and seek God's guidance through His Word,
[1403.86 --> 1405.50]  through His Scripture that was given to us.
[1405.78 --> 1411.20]  And so we get to share God's heart and crave that righteousness that we talked about today.
[1411.20 --> 1414.62]  And so be encouraged, hope.
[1415.18 --> 1418.50]  As the latter part of our beatitude says, it doesn't stop with,
[1418.72 --> 1420.72]  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[1422.14 --> 1422.60]  Good luck.
[1423.60 --> 1425.14]  That's not how it ends.
[1425.84 --> 1428.32]  It says it's a proclamation of the truth.
[1428.76 --> 1430.62]  You will be filled.
[1431.52 --> 1433.30]  You will be satisfied.
[1433.64 --> 1433.96]  Why?
[1434.32 --> 1436.22]  Because that restoration is done.
[1436.22 --> 1442.06]  Christ has won victory over sin and death and all brokenness.
[1442.24 --> 1442.98]  It is done.
[1444.20 --> 1449.30]  And here and now we get to try and reflect that finished mission that God has already accomplished.
[1450.52 --> 1453.20]  And we get to try and reflect a little bit of that here and now.
[1454.02 --> 1456.02]  That's the hope that we get to live in.
[1456.28 --> 1458.64]  And that's why the beatitude today says,
[1458.96 --> 1459.96]  You will be filled.
[1460.26 --> 1461.38]  You will be satisfied.
[1461.80 --> 1465.26]  This is not an up-in-the-air battle that we get to face.
[1465.26 --> 1468.38]  We've already been promised victory in Christ.
[1469.70 --> 1474.10]  So may we desire that righteousness with God.
[1474.40 --> 1477.70]  May we desire that shalom, sharing God's heart.
[1477.98 --> 1486.56]  And may we depend on Him and God to accomplish that mission for our lives and for our church.
[1487.50 --> 1489.62]  May that be the encouragement for us this morning.
[1490.06 --> 1490.58]  Let's pray.
[1490.58 --> 1490.64]  Let's pray.
[1495.26 --> 1496.26]  Let's pray.
[1496.26 --> 1497.26]  Let's pray.
[1498.90 --> 1499.74]  Loving Father,
[1500.28 --> 1503.98]  We know You are a good and gracious King.
[1505.92 --> 1510.00]  We know that You, Yourself, are righteous.
[1510.48 --> 1514.10]  You desire and You have accomplished shalom relationship.
[1515.10 --> 1517.98]  You have accomplished Your mission on the cross.
[1517.98 --> 1522.90]  And Lord, may we seek your kingdom here and now.
[1523.54 --> 1526.84]  May we desire that righteousness just as you do.
[1527.92 --> 1529.46]  Help us, guide us.
[1531.06 --> 1533.58]  Allow us the freedom to bear your fruits
[1533.58 --> 1536.22]  for love and care
[1536.22 --> 1540.12]  and that shalom that we desperately want.
[1541.04 --> 1542.50]  Equip us, empower us.
[1543.66 --> 1547.10]  May we reflect that every day in our ordinary lives
[1547.10 --> 1549.32]  and when we come together as your church.
[1549.66 --> 1551.76]  May we glorify you through our lives.
[1554.74 --> 1556.82]  We thank you so much for your work.
[1557.30 --> 1560.14]  Be with us continually in your spirit, we pray.
[1560.96 --> 1561.20]  Amen.
[1562.68 --> 1565.62]  I invite you to stand as we sing our song of response.
