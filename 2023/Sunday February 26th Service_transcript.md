[0.00 --> 5.12]  Well, as you know, we're in the season of Lent.
[5.66 --> 8.54]  And for this next number of weeks, for the next seven weeks,
[8.58 --> 11.72]  we're going to be preaching a series on this light and fluffy topic of suffering.
[12.68 --> 13.82]  You know, light and fluffy.
[14.34 --> 16.68]  And I want to acknowledge as we begin these banners,
[16.94 --> 20.36]  you have now come to know that we've got this great Hope Art Collective
[20.36 --> 22.12]  that makes banners for all of our series.
[22.36 --> 24.12]  And I just want to say thank you to John and the whole team.
[24.20 --> 25.40]  I think Colette put these together.
[25.82 --> 29.28]  But I'm sure you can sort of take already in what the theme of this banner is,
[29.28 --> 31.44]  that the light of Christ is shining in the dark places.
[32.06 --> 34.42]  And as he walks with us and he walks towards us,
[34.52 --> 37.06]  we experience his light and his presence.
[39.54 --> 42.22]  This season, as I said, we're going to be looking at suffering.
[42.22 --> 45.48]  And we're going to be naming the realities that we face in our relationships,
[45.88 --> 48.00]  our health, our friendships, our work.
[48.30 --> 49.84]  And we're going to be naming those painful realities
[49.84 --> 53.68]  and discussing specifically the way that Christ, our suffering servant,
[53.88 --> 58.06]  enters into those and provides us that which we need to live in suffering
[58.06 --> 61.72]  and to live with hope of where suffering is going in Jesus.
[62.88 --> 66.14]  And I'm going to read a sort of guiding passage for this whole series.
[66.26 --> 69.54]  But if you have your Bible, I'd invite you to turn with me to John chapter 16.
[70.26 --> 72.78]  I'm going to read the end of his teaching on what's going to happen
[72.78 --> 75.88]  as he prepares his disciples for his death and his resurrection.
[76.54 --> 79.04]  This is John 16, 32 and 33.
[79.04 --> 82.76]  Here's the words of Jesus.
[83.76 --> 88.80]  A time is coming, and in fact has come, when you will be scattered.
[89.46 --> 91.08]  Each of you to your own home.
[91.16 --> 92.56]  You will leave me all alone.
[93.28 --> 96.56]  Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.
[97.40 --> 100.70]  I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace.
[101.54 --> 104.10]  In this world you will have trouble, but take heart.
[104.62 --> 107.30]  I have overcome the world.
[107.30 --> 112.22]  I'm realizing even as I read this passage that I'm basically just going to be
[112.22 --> 116.84]  preaching an extended version of Sid's sermon just a minute ago in this interview
[116.84 --> 119.34]  and elaborating on a bit of what he's already told you.
[121.38 --> 123.68]  Have you ever gotten that phone call?
[125.38 --> 128.86]  The phone call where someone shared something with you that was so overwhelming
[128.86 --> 132.98]  and difficult to take in that you really couldn't process what was being said to you.
[133.96 --> 136.24]  Maybe it's the phone call from your daughter who said,
[136.24 --> 140.88]  my husband has left me, our marriage of 10 years is over, and I'm moving back home.
[142.32 --> 145.42]  Perhaps it's the phone call from your dad who said,
[145.54 --> 150.16]  my test results have come in, I'm told that I have six months to live and to get my affairs in order.
[151.44 --> 153.24]  Perhaps it's the phone call from a friend who says,
[153.32 --> 155.74]  you can stop praying for the baby, it didn't make it to full term.
[155.74 --> 161.20]  Or it's a call from the police who say, there's been an accident, you need to come to the hospital right away.
[163.32 --> 167.20]  If you have had that phone call, and I'm guessing some of you are remembering that phone call,
[167.24 --> 168.78]  if you haven't, you will.
[169.54 --> 171.04]  Those calls will come.
[171.46 --> 174.62]  And you will learn in those moments, there's not really anything you can say.
[174.82 --> 178.52]  There are no words you can say to gloss over the pain, the suffering, and the reality
[178.52 --> 182.06]  of the heaviness of life of suffering in this world.
[183.90 --> 186.94]  One of the things we're going to say this week and come back to in future weeks is that
[186.94 --> 190.78]  every single person, doesn't matter what you believe, doesn't matter what your worldview or religion is,
[190.82 --> 193.26]  you have to make some sense of suffering.
[194.08 --> 196.28]  Whether you're an agnostic, atheist, Christian, or Buddhist,
[196.28 --> 204.34]  you will have to figure out in some way why it is that life can be so hard, so cruel, and so unfair.
[204.34 --> 208.74]  And as Pastor Sid mentioned to me when he talked about this theology of suffering,
[208.84 --> 212.38]  and often in conversation, Christians can be terrible at this.
[213.18 --> 217.06]  Christians can be very terrible at talking about suffering, and I would say church in general
[217.06 --> 221.38]  is often notorious for saying, let's celebrate the good and not talk about the bad.
[221.76 --> 225.44]  Let's have services with lots of testimonies about breakthroughs and overcoming addictions
[225.44 --> 228.40]  and various things, and let's make sure when we talk about the hard stuff,
[228.46 --> 230.34]  it's always in the past tense, right?
[231.14 --> 232.26]  And there's good reason for that.
[232.32 --> 233.00]  Let me just be clear.
[233.00 --> 235.08]  It is good for the church to celebrate.
[235.24 --> 237.92]  At the center of our Christian faith is the good news of Jesus
[237.92 --> 242.68]  and the transforming power of His resurrection that does bring transformation, healing, and restoration.
[243.54 --> 247.42]  But can we be honest in saying that much of the pain that many of us are having,
[247.50 --> 250.60]  even this morning, may be pain you carry for the rest of your life.
[251.70 --> 254.60]  It may be something that you never get an answer from the Lord for,
[254.72 --> 258.18]  why you have to go through this, why your friends get this and you don't,
[258.26 --> 259.90]  why they don't have pain and you do.
[259.90 --> 262.36]  Those might be things you carry for the rest of your life.
[262.90 --> 266.98]  And we have to be able, as Christians, not just to talk about them,
[267.56 --> 270.42]  but to grapple in the face of God with them,
[270.74 --> 275.86]  to speak and live as believers, honestly bringing before Him the pain, the hurt, the heaviness,
[275.98 --> 277.70]  all the stuff of suffering,
[277.70 --> 285.22]  as people who really do believe that Jesus is present to us in the mountaintop experience of love,
[285.94 --> 289.16]  in the green pastures that He leads us beside, as well as the storm.
[289.56 --> 290.66]  He's present there too.
[290.74 --> 293.16]  That's the undergirding conviction of this whole sermon series.
[293.16 --> 299.56]  And we want to work out how He's present in the suffering.
[299.98 --> 301.88]  And I want to read for us again this passage.
[302.02 --> 304.72]  I'm going to focus on verse 33, where Jesus starts by saying,
[305.46 --> 308.56]  I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.
[309.40 --> 313.96]  In this world you will have trouble, but take heart, I've overcome the world.
[315.10 --> 318.60]  Now the first thing to note is He's preparing His disciples for His leaving.
[319.18 --> 320.48]  He wants them to know in advance.
[320.58 --> 322.76]  In fact, my daughter is reading through the Gospel of Mark,
[322.82 --> 325.76]  and she's noticed how Jesus keeps telling His disciples in advance
[325.76 --> 328.00]  that He's going to get betrayed, He's going to get arrested,
[328.16 --> 329.44]  He's going to get flogged, He's going to get crucified,
[329.58 --> 330.48]  and then He's going to resurrect.
[330.84 --> 331.82]  He's going to rise from the dead.
[332.32 --> 334.62]  But His disciples don't know this, they don't believe it,
[334.64 --> 336.92]  they don't understand it, and yet Jesus does.
[336.96 --> 338.48]  He's just revealing it to them straight up.
[338.48 --> 340.74]  And what's fascinating to me is Jesus says to them,
[341.10 --> 344.42]  and when all this happens, you disciples, those close followers of mine,
[344.50 --> 345.66]  you're going to just run away.
[346.24 --> 348.70]  You are going to abandon me in my moment of need.
[348.80 --> 351.16]  You're going to say you don't have anything to do with me
[351.16 --> 353.24]  in my moment of being questioned and interrogated.
[353.52 --> 354.06]  And guess what?
[354.14 --> 357.38]  Even more striking to me is Jesus doesn't hate them for it.
[358.26 --> 360.94]  Think of how we would deal with someone if we knew they were going to abandon us.
[361.36 --> 364.28]  If we knew that in this relationship someone's going to stab us in the back,
[364.28 --> 365.78]  and Jesus, who knows they're going to do that,
[366.04 --> 368.00]  He says, I'm going to speak with you tenderly.
[368.82 --> 372.46]  I'm going to give you some truth that you need to know as these things unfold.
[372.46 --> 374.76]  I'm going to prepare you for these heavy events that are coming.
[375.16 --> 380.20]  He is a masterful, loving, and tender Savior to a group of abandoning disciples.
[382.32 --> 385.02]  He wants them to have His peace even when they're going to betray Him.
[385.08 --> 388.50]  He wants them to know where security lies even as their bottom will fall out
[388.50 --> 390.28]  and they watch their Savior get crucified.
[391.38 --> 393.34]  I want to read for you a quote from Dale Bruner,
[394.04 --> 395.98]  his commentary on this part of John's Gospel.
[396.10 --> 398.54]  Dale Bruner is one of my favorite commentaries, and this is what he writes.
[398.54 --> 403.28]  He writes, Jesus knows our fallibility.
[404.24 --> 409.92]  He knows that we will never have peace as long as we look at ourselves as we are
[409.92 --> 415.48]  or at our history as we have lived it or at our future as we hope to live it.
[415.48 --> 422.78]  There is only one place in all the world where we can have peace, in me.
[422.78 --> 430.70]  In Jesus' faithful and dying friendship with us, in His unfallible love for us.
[430.70 --> 438.24]  I don't know if any of you have been following the revival in Asbury, Kentucky.
[438.36 --> 439.46]  Has anyone been reading about this?
[439.90 --> 440.36]  There's a number.
[440.58 --> 441.96]  I see a few hands up there.
[442.42 --> 443.24]  You can go read about it.
[443.26 --> 446.34]  I've been quite taken by it because there's this university in Kentucky,
[446.46 --> 448.22]  a small little Christian university where there's a chapel,
[448.66 --> 450.90]  and that chapel is as ordinary as can be, but students stayed,
[451.00 --> 452.28]  and they prayed confession prayers,
[452.54 --> 455.28]  and that just became two weeks of un-finishing worship.
[455.46 --> 456.18]  In fact, it kept going.
[456.18 --> 460.76]  Last Sunday, 20,000 people, 20,000 people showed up at that campus to pray,
[460.90 --> 463.02]  to worship, to confess, to be in the presence of Christ.
[463.50 --> 465.26]  And lots of controversy around it.
[465.36 --> 468.62]  Nevertheless, what's striking to me is reading quotes from people who have been there,
[469.30 --> 473.48]  one of the common themes in that whole sharing was peace.
[474.08 --> 475.82]  People who show up with lives that are a mess,
[475.92 --> 479.20]  people who are in the presence of Jesus miraculously, mysteriously, and powerfully,
[479.28 --> 481.86]  they sense the peace of the presence of Jesus.
[481.86 --> 484.42]  And it's not a surprise that Jesus says,
[484.64 --> 486.74]  in me, you will have peace.
[488.20 --> 490.08]  But then we get to the passage where it's probably,
[490.40 --> 492.58]  this might be one of the most unpopular promises of Jesus.
[492.72 --> 493.88]  You won't see this in the greeting cards.
[494.04 --> 495.48]  You won't see this in the aisles of shoppers,
[495.64 --> 498.68]  where Jesus says, I promise that in this world, you're going to have trouble.
[499.84 --> 501.72]  In this world, you will have trouble.
[501.80 --> 502.72]  It's a statement of fact.
[502.78 --> 504.58]  And if you have a different translation, this is the NIV,
[504.88 --> 506.14]  there's so many different words used.
[506.22 --> 509.04]  It's the word distress, it's trials, it's temptation,
[509.42 --> 511.16]  it is persecution, and it's sorrow.
[511.16 --> 514.44]  All those words are brought into that one word, trouble.
[515.06 --> 518.72]  Distress, trial, tribulation, persecution, and sorrow.
[519.56 --> 521.36]  And Jesus says, in this world, you're going to have that.
[521.94 --> 523.54]  No bait-and-switch discipleship with Jesus,
[523.62 --> 525.04]  no promise of ease, comfort, and money.
[525.20 --> 526.36]  In this world, you're going to have trouble.
[526.48 --> 527.68]  That's His promise to His disciples.
[529.00 --> 532.44]  And I find it very helpful to know that Jesus is honest about that.
[533.36 --> 536.34]  He doesn't give us any false hope of how easy things might be.
[536.42 --> 537.50]  And it's true in two senses.
[537.90 --> 540.56]  It is true that every human who lives in this world will have trouble.
[541.16 --> 542.18]  You will have friends betray you.
[542.28 --> 543.26]  Your health will decline.
[543.36 --> 543.92]  You will age.
[543.98 --> 546.44]  And one day you will, like every other human, you will die.
[547.00 --> 549.54]  That is just a promise to all humans living in a broken world.
[549.62 --> 554.20]  But specifically, trouble comes to those who want to follow Jesus in specific ways.
[555.06 --> 557.20]  Jesus says to His disciples, you're going to have trouble.
[557.28 --> 559.42]  And they don't realize until after His death and His resurrection,
[559.56 --> 562.10]  as they start preaching Jesus' name, what He means.
[562.10 --> 565.52]  Because they have people both within the synagogues and in the streets
[565.52 --> 567.64]  hating the message they preach about Jesus.
[568.46 --> 571.76]  And I'm struck, there's a passage in Acts chapter 5 where they're preaching
[571.76 --> 573.62]  and they get pulled into the synagogue.
[573.86 --> 577.52]  The Jewish leaders are hostile with them for this person of Jesus who fulfills the Old Testament.
[577.90 --> 579.38]  And the Jews don't know what to do with them.
[579.46 --> 580.68]  They flog the disciples.
[580.68 --> 582.40]  And there's this passage where it says,
[582.78 --> 589.84]  the disciples rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus.
[592.04 --> 594.08]  What that says to me among many things is,
[594.34 --> 597.46]  they had no illusions about what it meant to follow Christ.
[597.56 --> 601.00]  They had no illusions that life was going to be easy when they started proclaiming the word of Jesus.
[601.20 --> 603.02]  And they had no illusions that suffering would come.
[603.08 --> 605.54]  And when it did, they had a new story for it.
[605.58 --> 607.16]  We're going to talk about that more in just a minute.
[607.16 --> 609.68]  They had a sense of, yes, if Jesus was a suffering servant,
[609.88 --> 613.32]  we are going to participate in that suffering and that's going to be part of our lives as well.
[613.52 --> 616.80]  I don't think that's the case for much of the Western church.
[619.88 --> 621.36]  Then Jesus gives the good news.
[622.26 --> 623.46]  He says, in this world you're going to have trouble,
[624.30 --> 626.56]  but take heart, I've overcome the world.
[627.02 --> 629.84]  Or different translations will say, but be of good cheer.
[629.98 --> 632.22]  I mean, right on the heels of this day, but be of good cheer.
[632.84 --> 635.16]  I have overcome the world.
[635.16 --> 640.96]  And it's interesting that Jesus doesn't give them any bumper sticker cliche about how to deal with suffering.
[641.06 --> 646.92]  I mean, there's no shortage of weird and even, I think, unwise statements about suffering in the modern world.
[647.02 --> 649.40]  One of them is, you know, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.
[649.44 --> 649.98]  Have you heard that one?
[650.52 --> 652.60]  Another one is, pain is just weakness leaving the body.
[652.66 --> 654.76]  And I think that's probably the most foolish one I've heard.
[655.34 --> 657.34]  Another one is, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[657.48 --> 660.14]  I would say that's probably also, I mean, there's insight there,
[660.20 --> 662.46]  but these are the kind of things we tell ourselves with suffering.
[662.46 --> 665.74]  And Jesus says nothing about what you are supposed to do when you suffer.
[665.84 --> 669.72]  He says everything about what He will do to enable us to suffer appropriately.
[670.58 --> 672.98]  Because His answer to our suffering is not about us, it's about Him.
[673.66 --> 676.36]  He says, I have overcome the world.
[676.42 --> 678.02]  That's a statement about reality.
[678.54 --> 685.52]  And what He's saying is, He has been sent to deal with and overcome the ultimate sources of our suffering.
[685.96 --> 694.16]  That's why Jesus has come, to deal with the ultimate sources of that which brings all the pain and all the misery and all the hate and the violence and the difficulty in our world.
[695.18 --> 696.32]  He has come to do it.
[696.70 --> 698.86]  And for the rest of the sermon, I'm going to share how that works.
[699.64 --> 704.24]  In a very real sense, Jesus' statement can only be understood in the whole story of the Bible.
[705.02 --> 709.02]  You hear us say this a lot, I hope, that you can only understand some passage when you put it in the whole story.
[709.02 --> 714.80]  But I would say this, every person, no matter, again, what you believe, you have to have some story that accounts for suffering.
[715.36 --> 716.22]  Where did it come from?
[716.78 --> 717.92]  Why is it in our world?
[718.28 --> 719.36]  How are we supposed to live with it?
[719.40 --> 721.20]  What's the future supposed to be with suffering?
[721.28 --> 722.30]  Is it going to be here always?
[722.62 --> 723.56]  Do we just have to live with it?
[723.62 --> 725.58]  What's the story that makes sense of suffering?
[725.90 --> 730.52]  And Jesus speaks these words of overcoming suffering within the whole story of the Bible.
[731.42 --> 734.74]  Jesus only makes sense, in my opinion, in the whole story of the Bible.
[734.86 --> 735.56]  And guess what, Hope?
[735.56 --> 739.92]  Hope, the beginning of the story does not include suffering.
[741.08 --> 743.54]  In the beginning, there was no suffering.
[744.16 --> 752.70]  There was a Trinitarian God who was out of love decided to make this beautiful world and place humans in it so that they would enjoy it in His presence,
[753.06 --> 758.64]  delight in it, develop it, cultivate it, live within perfect harmony with one another, with God and the non-human creation.
[758.94 --> 762.52]  This world was started and created to be a place of life.
[763.08 --> 764.10]  There was no suffering.
[764.10 --> 770.24]  And it's not until we get to Genesis 3, the next part of the story of the Bible, where we see how suffering enters into the story.
[770.82 --> 779.86]  And it starts with this deceiver, this tempter, this liar, Satan, who deceives God's first humans to rebel against God, and out of that comes a mess.
[780.44 --> 789.38]  It's deception that leads to rebellion, humans taking control of their own lives, that leads to this infection, this corruption, this pollution that is sin.
[789.38 --> 795.52]  This mysterious way in which the shalom of our world has been vandalized, to use the words of one of my favorite writers,
[795.52 --> 801.16]  that we live in this fractured, broken, hateful world, and all of us are trying to figure out why is it this way?
[801.38 --> 806.52]  And the biblical story says this is how it came to be, through deception that led to rebellion.
[806.52 --> 812.36]  And it doesn't mean that every time you experience suffering, it's that you've inflicted upon someone or they've inflicted upon you.
[812.50 --> 818.22]  It's part of the very creation itself, groaning under the weight of corruption and sin.
[818.22 --> 822.72]  And you feel that every time you experience loneliness.
[823.86 --> 826.50]  You feel that every time your friend betrays you.
[827.18 --> 831.56]  You feel that when getting up out of the bed in the morning is so hard because your mental state is so low.
[832.54 --> 836.20]  You feel that when you flunk out of school or your friend is cruel.
[836.40 --> 838.52]  You feel it when you lose your job unjustly.
[839.50 --> 842.52]  You realize that this world is not the way it's supposed to be.
[843.26 --> 846.42]  That suffering gives you an ache for a better world.
[846.42 --> 848.48]  And I'm convinced every person has this ache.
[848.72 --> 851.16]  But Christians have a story for it in the Scriptures.
[852.28 --> 856.42]  And guess whose heart aches more than all of ours for our suffering and all suffering?
[857.94 --> 858.46]  God's.
[859.62 --> 865.24]  Guess whose heart is more broken than yours and mine for the state of misery in our world?
[866.48 --> 866.96]  God's.
[867.50 --> 872.98]  And perhaps most importantly, guess who is more compelled towards action as a result of suffering?
[873.70 --> 874.28]  God is.
[874.28 --> 874.84]  God is.
[874.84 --> 879.04]  In Genesis 3, right after Satan deceives Adam and Eve and they rebel against God,
[879.26 --> 882.22]  Jesus speaks these words of curse to creation to Adam and Eve and to Satan.
[882.30 --> 884.38]  What he says to Satan is so staggering.
[884.98 --> 889.76]  He says to Satan, the offspring of Eve's womb, you're going to strike that offspring's heel.
[890.38 --> 891.14]  You know what he says next?
[892.22 --> 897.72]  But you, that offspring, is going to strike the serpent's head and crush it.
[897.72 --> 902.88]  And I might say that the rest of the whole story of the Bible is God making good on that promise.
[902.88 --> 907.12]  In Genesis 3, 15, that's when we're told that the serpent's head is going to be crushed by the offspring.
[907.40 --> 912.40]  And the rest of the biblical story is God working powerfully to make that moment come to fruition.
[912.84 --> 917.88]  Working powerfully through Israel, through all his prophets, all his people such that out of Israel, the offspring of Eve,
[917.96 --> 919.20]  comes this person that is Jesus.
[919.20 --> 921.28]  And he didn't just show up, he was sent.
[921.74 --> 926.94]  And he was sent to overcome the power of Satan, to overpower the power of death,
[927.04 --> 930.96]  and to release humanity from the crippling, corrupting power of sin.
[931.22 --> 932.60]  That's why Jesus shows up.
[933.38 --> 939.38]  He came as part of a story in God's good creation to redeem it from all the suffering and sin.
[939.38 --> 943.56]  And guess how?
[946.40 --> 947.18]  By suffering.
[949.02 --> 952.80]  You might say that could be, it's one of the most unique things, I think, about Christianity.
[952.94 --> 955.98]  In fact, writers who are not Christians say one of the unique things about the Christian faith is,
[956.26 --> 959.14]  at the center of it is a God who suffers.
[959.80 --> 960.66]  It's not detached.
[961.06 --> 961.74]  It's not disconnected.
[962.16 --> 966.62]  He doesn't live in sort of a helpful or a helpless distance from all that we're going through.
[966.62 --> 969.54]  He's in the muck, and he's a God who suffers.
[971.98 --> 974.36]  I want to tell you a story about Nicholas Wolterstorff.
[974.70 --> 976.48]  I've actually shared this before a number of years ago.
[976.56 --> 981.28]  He is a philosophy professor, and he's also someone who experienced a great deal of tragedy.
[981.66 --> 984.54]  When his son was 20, his son was in a hiking accident, and he died.
[985.28 --> 988.06]  And Nicholas Wolterstorff, who was, you know, for many, many years,
[988.14 --> 990.68]  he was a very well-known philosopher, extremely bright academic.
[990.88 --> 994.14]  Now he was very, very lonely in his grief.
[994.14 --> 998.70]  And now as an academic, he had to put his pen to paper and talk about how he felt about God,
[998.76 --> 999.60]  how he felt about Jesus.
[999.70 --> 1000.26]  He was a Christian.
[1000.56 --> 1004.08]  And how he grappled with the reality of his son dying at the age of 20.
[1004.22 --> 1009.22]  What do you say about God as a philosopher when your son dies at the age of 20?
[1009.28 --> 1013.32]  And I want to read for you one of my favorite quotes in a book called Lament for a Son.
[1013.40 --> 1017.16]  And if you're in this season, by the way, this book I highly commend to you.
[1017.16 --> 1018.68]  He writes,
[1018.68 --> 1041.04]  And here he just goes right to the heart.
[1041.04 --> 1044.70]  If you have not abandoned us, explain yourself.
[1045.68 --> 1055.08]  We strain to hear, but instead of hearing an answer, we catch sight of God himself, scraped and torn.
[1055.74 --> 1058.52]  Through our tears, we see the tears of God.
[1058.94 --> 1062.00]  And a new, more disturbing question now arises.
[1062.76 --> 1066.76]  Why do you permit yourself to suffer?
[1066.76 --> 1075.74]  You see, what Wolterstorff was doing there in his deepest moment of grief was grappling with his scriptures.
[1076.38 --> 1081.30]  And what grabbed his heart the most and sort of what he latched onto is the God that he worshipped,
[1081.36 --> 1087.30]  the God that he grew up believing was a God who is with him in the morning bench, a God who suffers.
[1088.20 --> 1092.62]  And that was a God who he could stake his life on, stake his hope on, stake his faith on
[1092.62 --> 1095.70]  when his son's life was taken way too early.
[1095.70 --> 1100.42]  I want to read for you, actually this is something Wolterstorff talks about,
[1101.12 --> 1104.08]  but words I never want us to skim over, even if you've grown up in the church.
[1104.62 --> 1107.40]  And these are words from Psalm, or sorry, Isaiah 53.
[1108.16 --> 1109.08]  Words about Jesus.
[1110.34 --> 1114.42]  We read in Psalm 53 that he had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,
[1115.18 --> 1118.08]  nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
[1118.08 --> 1121.86]  He was despised and rejected by mankind.
[1122.50 --> 1128.20]  A man of suffering, familiar with pain.
[1129.18 --> 1134.74]  And what held Wolterstorff in his grief was that the God he worshipped was familiar with his pain.
[1135.32 --> 1137.22]  The God he prayed to gets it.
[1137.30 --> 1138.06]  He's been there.
[1138.12 --> 1139.30]  And I think that's what everyone needs.
[1139.38 --> 1143.00]  Whenever you go through the journey of pain and loss, you want to talk to someone who knows it.
[1143.00 --> 1147.54]  And what Wolterstorff came to realize is the God he worships was a God who suffers.
[1148.02 --> 1149.90]  And that's a God he can hold to.
[1150.20 --> 1154.30]  And a God who holds him in the midst of grief and pain and loss.
[1154.30 --> 1162.00]  A few verses later, we read these words in Isaiah 53.
[1162.90 --> 1165.50]  Not only does God suffer with us, he suffers for us.
[1165.56 --> 1165.96]  We read,
[1166.32 --> 1168.80]  He took up our pain and bore our suffering.
[1169.48 --> 1173.22]  Yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted.
[1173.98 --> 1176.08]  But he was pierced for our transgressions.
[1176.82 --> 1178.38]  He was crushed for our iniquities.
[1179.00 --> 1182.04]  And the punishment that brought us peace was on him.
[1182.04 --> 1186.72]  And by his wounds, we are healed.
[1189.34 --> 1192.92]  And what I think every believer needs to do, whatever season they're in of grief and suffering,
[1193.02 --> 1195.52]  is place their suffering within the story.
[1196.34 --> 1197.48]  I think that's what gives us hope.
[1197.58 --> 1198.50]  That's what gives us strength.
[1198.60 --> 1201.92]  That's what enables us to walk through a world that inflicts so much pain on us.
[1202.00 --> 1204.18]  Pain that feels so unjust and so wrong because it is.
[1204.34 --> 1205.58]  It's not the way it's supposed to be.
[1206.68 --> 1210.30]  And I want to say just three things in conclusion about suffering.
[1210.30 --> 1214.66]  And number one, what Walter Storff already pointed out, that the God we worship is a God who suffers with us.
[1215.62 --> 1218.58]  And he is present to us in our suffering.
[1219.34 --> 1224.12]  I'm sure I could interview many people, and I'm guessing some of us who are a bit older could tell many stories
[1224.12 --> 1229.48]  of how in the bottom of pain, in sort of the basement of grief, they found God show up.
[1230.04 --> 1231.24]  Jesus was there.
[1231.24 --> 1235.22]  Jesus ministers in unique ways in those places of pain.
[1235.58 --> 1237.84]  God suffers with us.
[1238.06 --> 1244.72]  But number two, and we share this in our series on James, that nothing is wasted in the hands of God.
[1245.70 --> 1249.14]  Suffering is not useless in the hands of God.
[1249.48 --> 1251.40]  He uses it to form us, to deepen us.
[1251.56 --> 1255.88]  And Sid talked about this, to shape us into people we would never otherwise be without suffering.
[1256.54 --> 1257.72]  And no one wants it.
[1258.04 --> 1259.14]  No one's looking for it.
[1259.14 --> 1260.82]  We never know what to do with it when it comes.
[1260.92 --> 1264.22]  And yet miraculously and mysteriously, God says, I'm going to use that.
[1264.28 --> 1268.66]  I didn't cause it, but I'm going to use it to make you new people, to make you deep people,
[1268.74 --> 1272.10]  to give you the vision for how to live your short lives well in life.
[1272.54 --> 1276.42]  And you, I'm sure, could give your testimonies for how suffering has made you who you are.
[1276.66 --> 1278.72]  Without it, you would not be the person you are today.
[1278.72 --> 1286.86]  Tim Keller, an author I quite love, and quote regularly behind this pulpit, he talked recently,
[1286.94 --> 1289.10]  not that long ago, about his own diagnosis with cancer.
[1289.16 --> 1290.92]  I don't know if you know this, but he has a pretty severe cancer.
[1291.88 --> 1295.90]  And he talked about her really, earlier in his ministry, he had walked with many people through cancer.
[1296.36 --> 1300.74]  And, you know, he had pastored them, he'd visit them, he kind of, you know, journeyed with them as a pastor would.
[1300.74 --> 1306.50]  And he said, you know, now that I have my own cancer diagnosis, I have a whole new level of compassion
[1306.50 --> 1309.98]  and appreciation for all that cancer patients are going through.
[1310.06 --> 1312.10]  He says, now I'm the one taking those medications.
[1312.54 --> 1314.60]  Now I'm the one who has all those doctor's appointments.
[1314.80 --> 1318.12]  I'm the one who feels nauseous the week after and the day after my treatments.
[1318.38 --> 1322.18]  Now I'm the one who finally gets what all the people in my church were going through
[1322.18 --> 1325.50]  and have a compassion for it because I'm now suffering with them.
[1326.20 --> 1330.64]  And his point was, and I've heard this from other people as well, is you can suffer and it can make you bitter.
[1330.74 --> 1334.34]  You can suffer and it can make you an awful person.
[1335.32 --> 1340.32]  Or you can hold that suffering before the face of God and allow him to change you through it.
[1341.14 --> 1345.24]  Suffering, if you want it to be, can be something that is awful and it turns you into a horrible person.
[1345.92 --> 1350.74]  But suffering, when you place it in the story of God, can be something that changes you into a person
[1350.74 --> 1354.94]  who will then minister to others out of your own wounds, out of your own pain,
[1355.00 --> 1358.56]  and become a source of grace and hope and compassion in the midst of it.
[1359.20 --> 1360.36]  If you let it.
[1360.74 --> 1372.46]  But the final point is, this is the good one, that the story of the Bible is a story that gives us hope for a day without suffering.
[1373.22 --> 1378.38]  When Jesus says, take heart, I've overcome the world, he's saying that this creation started without suffering
[1378.38 --> 1380.82]  and this creation will finish without suffering.
[1381.16 --> 1385.84]  The beginning of history started without suffering and the end of history will go without suffering.
[1385.84 --> 1389.30]  And that's, you know, what the cross secures for all of us.
[1390.14 --> 1394.32]  In Revelation, one of my favorite passages is actually not Revelation 21, which is the popular one,
[1394.48 --> 1395.36]  but Revelation 5.
[1395.46 --> 1396.68]  It shows all the people of the world.
[1396.78 --> 1397.56]  It's a picture of the future.
[1397.64 --> 1401.16]  All the people gathering on the throne and they're worshiping this slain lamb.
[1401.22 --> 1403.78]  And they're saying, he's worthy because he has conquered Satan.
[1404.10 --> 1406.44]  He's worthy because he rose victorious over the grave.
[1406.60 --> 1410.14]  Because he did it, the whole world gets to experience resurrection with him.
[1410.14 --> 1417.98]  Because Jesus conquered, we get to taste the sweet victory of one day, bodies that work properly and don't die.
[1418.58 --> 1425.10]  We get to experience minds that aren't plummeting to deep and dark places because of depression and bipolar and all the rest.
[1425.54 --> 1432.30]  We get to experience hands that move and legs that run, relationships that don't fray and break because we're so full of hate and revenge and all the rest.
[1432.34 --> 1435.48]  We get to experience life as it was meant to be.
[1435.48 --> 1440.04]  The Jesus who overcomes in John 16 says, take heart.
[1440.68 --> 1441.64]  Your day is coming.
[1442.16 --> 1450.80]  I will return and I will eradicate this world of sin and evil and violence and hate and you will taste new bodies and a new creation forever.
[1451.58 --> 1454.48]  And that is the story that makes suffering sufferable.
[1455.82 --> 1459.72]  That's the story that gives us hope in the darkest places that Jesus says, take heart.
[1459.72 --> 1467.00]  That day is coming where you will taste the victory of my death and resurrection.
[1468.98 --> 1470.78]  I want to finish with a story about my uncle.
[1471.02 --> 1474.16]  I don't know if you know this and I don't know if I've shared this, but in the last three months I've lost two uncles.
[1474.28 --> 1475.90]  My uncle John died three months ago.
[1475.96 --> 1477.68]  My uncle Bob died two weeks ago.
[1478.32 --> 1480.34]  And he died at the age of 67, my uncle Bob.
[1481.40 --> 1483.36]  Diagnosed with cancer a number of years ago.
[1483.58 --> 1485.44]  Was given a very short amount of time to live.
[1485.44 --> 1488.18]  And then he went through experimental treatment.
[1488.38 --> 1490.72]  Was given four extra years and we praised the Lord for those.
[1491.52 --> 1494.66]  And then three weeks ago he was told he's got about a week left.
[1494.86 --> 1495.80]  So the family gathered.
[1496.24 --> 1497.02]  Everyone's around him.
[1497.10 --> 1497.74]  He loved the Lord.
[1498.12 --> 1500.58]  And my parents were telling me two days before he died.
[1500.94 --> 1502.10]  He was at home in a bed.
[1502.62 --> 1503.64]  And he's got a big family.
[1503.88 --> 1504.40]  Seven siblings.
[1504.76 --> 1506.02]  And so they all gather around his bed.
[1506.30 --> 1507.94]  And in our family, wine is okay.
[1508.04 --> 1509.94]  And they actually had a glass of wine each.
[1510.00 --> 1510.80]  They're sharing stories.
[1510.92 --> 1511.66]  They're praying with him.
[1512.00 --> 1513.70]  They're reading the scriptures and singing together.
[1513.70 --> 1520.60]  And they were celebrating that Uncle Bob, who loved the Lord, was going to be taken by Jesus through death into life.
[1520.96 --> 1526.28]  And that body that had been so depleted by cancer was going to be made new.
[1527.60 --> 1534.50]  And as they gathered around that table, they celebrated the victory of Jesus that was going to take hold of Bob's life.
[1535.58 --> 1539.06]  And in this church, that's our story.
[1539.06 --> 1543.46]  For every person in this room, there's going to come a day where we're on the cancer bed or we're on the death bed.
[1543.72 --> 1549.84]  And I want people surrounding you and me saying, because of Jesus, you don't have to fear death.
[1550.42 --> 1557.70]  The end of the story is life forever with the resurrected bodies, with our resurrected Jesus.
[1559.20 --> 1561.74]  In this world, you're going to have trouble, Hope.
[1561.74 --> 1564.18]  But take heart, says Jesus.
[1564.44 --> 1566.20]  I've overcome the world.
[1566.96 --> 1567.54]  Let's pray.
[1567.54 --> 1567.56]  Let's pray.
[1567.56 --> 1567.58]  Let's pray.
[1567.58 --> 1567.60]  Let's pray.
[1591.74 --> 1593.26]  Father, we thank you for your word.
[1595.62 --> 1597.00]  We thank you for the cross.
[1598.68 --> 1599.90]  We thank you for hope.
[1601.60 --> 1604.66]  And we pray that whatever we go through, we live in that hope.
[1605.64 --> 1608.46]  And that you would be our Lord and our Savior forever.
[1609.74 --> 1610.04]  Amen.
[1612.44 --> 1615.96]  I invite you to stand and sing with me a favorite hymn of the generations.
[1616.30 --> 1618.56]  When peace like a river, let's sing our hope.
