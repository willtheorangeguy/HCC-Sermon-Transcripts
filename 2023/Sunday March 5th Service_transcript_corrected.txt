[0.00 → 3.04] Well, good morning, Hope.
[3.44 → 5.94] It is a gift to worship together, and I just want to say,
[6.04 → 7.66] I see some faces I've never seen before,
[7.82 → 9.56] and we're so glad you're here to worship with us.
[10.78 → 13.30] There's a writer named Dorothy Sayers who has said,
[14.18 → 16.92] what good is religion if it has nothing to say
[16.92 → 19.08] about what we do for the majority of our lives?
[20.12 → 20.48] Work.
[21.58 → 23.44] We do all life interviews in the evening,
[23.56 → 25.18] and we also are going to do another one this morning
[25.18 → 28.24] as a way of saying as a church, and for us as leaders of the church,
[28.24 → 30.10] that what you do Monday to Friday,
[30.70 → 34.30] or your shift works all over the week, that is sacred time.
[34.96 → 38.86] And God equips us on Sunday to equip us to serve faithfully on Monday.
[39.04 → 40.90] And so this morning, we're going to do an all-of-life interview
[40.90 → 43.48] with someone named Elsa, who's fairly new to our church,
[43.52 → 46.40] and she's going to talk about where God sent her Monday to Friday.
[46.50 → 47.38] So come on up, Elsa.
[57.38 → 57.98] Welcome.
[58.24 → 63.62] I see your husband, Peter, here in this service.
[63.82 → 66.30] I'd love for you to start by just saying a little bit about yourself
[66.30 → 68.74] and maybe how you found our church
[68.74 → 70.76] and where God sends you Monday to Friday.
[71.10 → 71.44] Okay.
[71.92 → 73.14] See if I can do it in that order.
[74.74 → 78.96] So I am married to my beloved husband, Peter, for 20-plus years.
[79.38 → 80.50] We have a daughter, Rachel.
[80.82 → 82.18] She was here in the first service.
[82.28 → 83.82] She's now gone to play airsoft.
[83.82 → 86.70] So, yeah.
[86.88 → 92.98] So we have a home in Glen Valley, and I work in Coverdale.
[93.20 → 94.46] What was the middle question?
[95.82 → 96.88] How you found our church?
[97.26 → 98.72] Oh, that was an important question.
[99.08 → 103.90] So my sister and brother-in-law started attending last bearish,
[103.90 → 107.68] and my beloved sister, who's my oldest sister,
[107.78 → 111.30] whom I have been trained to listen to well, said,
[111.48 → 112.40] you should go.
[112.62 → 113.62] You're here by force.
[114.28 → 114.98] It's tough.
[114.98 → 117.60] No, you know what?
[117.70 → 121.20] It's a God thing, right, as most things in my life are.
[122.12 → 126.38] At the same time, so we came to and All Life evening event
[126.38 → 130.28] and listened to a gentleman speak about grief, which is my specialty.
[131.92 → 135.66] And then the sanctuary, of course, was happening on the heels of that,
[135.88 → 139.48] and so mental health in the church is also something I'm pretty curious about.
[139.48 → 143.98] So Pete and I attended that, and we just haven't left.
[145.00 → 147.10] We'll try to keep you as long as we can, I'll share.
[147.58 → 149.98] So tell us a bit about your work in Coverdale.
[150.40 → 150.66] Sure.
[151.78 → 155.32] So I'm a clinical counsellor, have been for a number of years,
[155.94 → 158.72] and I have a private practice,
[159.16 → 163.08] but really quickly understood that private practice isn't for everyone
[163.08 → 165.68] because of the financial threshold.
[165.68 → 171.52] So I really wanted to look at ways to be more inclusive, I guess,
[171.80 → 174.12] a service that anyone could access.
[175.06 → 179.34] And so it started on Salt Spring.
[179.50 → 181.80] It moved here when my daughter went to high school here.
[182.44 → 186.22] It's in Coverdale now, and it's made, our clinic is made up of two parts.
[186.34 → 191.40] There's a private practice part that if people have benefits or can afford,
[191.40 → 194.06] they can come, and they can see a registered counsellor.
[194.24 → 196.86] I have a team of amazing counsellors that work with me.
[197.56 → 199.86] And if that's not something that's attainable,
[199.96 → 203.46] then we have this other really amazing service called Soul Matters.
[204.02 → 208.76] And it is a low-cost service, not-for-profit society,
[209.30 → 211.14] and so people can come through there,
[211.14 → 215.86] and they get served by students whom we all supervise.
[215.86 → 219.62] And so either way, you know,
[219.74 → 222.96] one of the things that I think I'm pretty passionate about
[222.96 → 224.68] is that no-barrier piece,
[225.10 → 227.66] and the financial piece is at the top, right?
[227.72 → 229.62] That's often why people can't come.
[230.14 → 233.24] And so we want to make sure that everyone has access to that service,
[233.36 → 234.90] and so it's pretty important to us.
[236.36 → 237.90] Alshah was sharing with me before
[237.90 → 241.64] that she set up this practice in the middle of Coverdale,
[241.76 → 243.84] downtown Coverdale, in the middle of the pandemic,
[243.84 → 245.68] which was interesting because it's terrible timing
[245.68 → 246.80] in terms of starting a business,
[247.08 → 248.50] and yet such important timing
[248.50 → 250.54] when you think of mental health and the pandemic.
[250.86 → 252.22] And we praise the Lord, by the way,
[252.28 → 254.86] that he's brought you and your work into our area.
[255.34 → 255.70] Thank you.
[255.94 → 258.38] I would love for you to share a bit about what you love
[258.38 → 259.52] about being a counsellor.
[260.28 → 263.06] Ooh, well, there are lots of things I love about being a counsellor.
[264.06 → 266.62] I've often threatened that I'll never retire from it,
[266.70 → 268.32] although I might get tired out.
[268.56 → 273.10] But I think what I love most is people, right?
[273.10 → 278.72] Just the amazing way in which I can connect with them,
[278.94 → 282.26] to see them deeply, to really hear their story,
[282.90 → 286.38] to be able to, like I consider it a real privilege
[286.38 → 288.68] to walk alongside someone in their pain,
[289.34 → 292.14] and to witness that suffering in ways
[292.14 → 296.10] that Christ can just swoop in and redeem all of that, right?
[296.10 → 298.56] Like I'm going to have a tear here soon
[298.56 → 302.18] because it's such a powerful process, right?
[302.34 → 304.56] And I get to do that Monday to Friday.
[304.94 → 307.74] Like how flippin' lucky am I, right?
[308.42 → 311.16] Just to be able to, yeah,
[311.26 → 313.38] just to be able to be there for someone.
[313.38 → 317.22] So that's, I think, the thing I love the most.
[318.12 → 322.68] And then to see people heal and change and grow and learn
[322.68 → 326.26] and find Christ sometimes in that process, right?
[326.30 → 328.00] Like that's energizing.
[328.18 → 329.90] That keeps me coming back.
[330.22 → 331.44] It's like a good drug.
[332.22 → 334.00] The counsellor probably shouldn't say that, but...
[334.00 → 334.62] That's right.
[334.72 → 336.92] We just heard a clinical counsellor talk about drugs.
[337.04 → 337.66] Can you mention that?
[337.66 → 339.90] That wasn't part of our interview plan.
[341.76 → 344.74] I would love for you to talk also a bit about the difficulty.
[344.98 → 346.86] You know, every job has its thorns and thistles.
[347.38 → 348.70] So talk about some of the pain
[348.70 → 350.50] and the challenges that come with being a counsellor.
[350.90 → 351.10] Sure.
[351.82 → 353.96] Sure, there's a flip side to it for sure.
[355.40 → 357.24] As much as I love that work,
[357.24 → 360.14] some of the stories that come in are really hard.
[361.10 → 366.66] People have been really hurt and damaged in this world.
[366.66 → 368.50] It's a hard world to live in.
[368.92 → 370.88] And I think it's getting harder every day.
[372.72 → 374.22] And so some of those pieces,
[374.44 → 376.42] some of the grief pieces that come in,
[377.04 → 379.46] they're hard stories to hear.
[380.18 → 385.76] And so that's a piece that I need to navigate personally,
[386.66 → 388.94] not to want to live their life,
[389.04 → 391.84] but to be alongside them enough to be present, right?
[391.86 → 393.70] So there's a real balance there for me.
[393.70 → 398.50] And it's also hard when people come, and they start,
[398.64 → 399.86] they kind of dip their toe in,
[400.30 → 402.40] and you know there's so much work to do,
[402.50 → 404.36] and then they don't come back.
[404.62 → 407.00] Or it's not the right time.
[407.30 → 408.62] And that's also hard,
[408.68 → 410.64] because I have such a heart to help people,
[411.64 → 414.84] and sometimes that's just not the right time, right?
[414.84 → 418.12] Okay, that leads to another question I have.
[418.88 → 420.86] Elsa gave me permission to freestyle with my question.
[420.96 → 422.48] So when you say that,
[423.00 → 423.88] I want to ask,
[423.94 → 424.98] and this is for everyone in our church.
[425.06 → 426.16] There's people right now,
[426.34 → 426.88] both services,
[427.04 → 428.34] who've got big stuff going on.
[428.50 → 429.52] And I want to ask you,
[430.32 → 432.04] when should someone consider going to a counsellor?
[432.34 → 433.48] What's the point at which they say,
[433.56 → 435.52] okay, this is more than I can carry on my own.
[435.64 → 436.52] I need to see a counsellor.
[436.68 → 437.26] Talk about that.
[437.44 → 437.66] Okay.
[438.24 → 439.34] Well, in the last service,
[439.44 → 441.36] I basically said everyone should come.
[441.36 → 442.76] And then we got offended and said,
[442.86 → 443.60] no, give us some more.
[445.64 → 446.92] You know, the truth is,
[447.04 → 449.58] we all have hard stuff in life, right?
[449.72 → 452.16] And some of us manage it better than others.
[452.44 → 455.30] Some of us have more hard stuff than others.
[455.48 → 458.14] And so it's not for me to say,
[458.32 → 459.38] oh, this is the path.
[459.42 → 460.54] If you hit X, Y, and Z,
[460.70 → 462.06] then you got to go, right?
[462.62 → 465.08] I think for me as a counsellor,
[465.08 → 466.90] to encourage someone to come in
[466.90 → 468.28] to do that kind of work,
[468.40 → 469.30] is to say,
[469.30 → 471.68] if you get to a place in your life
[471.68 → 474.74] where you can no longer manage it
[474.74 → 477.90] or it interferes with your ability
[477.90 → 479.30] to live your best life,
[479.94 → 482.30] that's the time to come in and talk about it.
[483.66 → 486.82] And not to be bashful about that,
[486.90 → 488.86] but just to be honest.
[490.06 → 491.50] If you get a good counsellor,
[491.50 → 493.64] they're going to love you to the best of their ability.
[494.12 → 495.26] They're going to come alongside.
[495.60 → 496.42] They're going to encourage.
[496.74 → 497.78] They're going to cry with you.
[497.86 → 498.90] They're going to laugh with you.
[499.58 → 501.50] And they're going to help you work it through.
[502.00 → 502.24] Right?
[503.62 → 504.84] That's the job description.
[505.84 → 506.62] It's a good one.
[507.42 → 509.12] And I'll just be forthright in saying,
[509.38 → 511.54] I mean, Pastor Sid was here last week
[511.54 → 513.32] and talking about his own experience of counselling.
[513.78 → 515.22] Just to say, if that season,
[515.36 → 516.34] if you're feeling right now
[516.34 → 518.32] like that conviction's there to see a counsellor,
[518.80 → 519.66] we do encourage you
[519.66 → 522.32] to take people like Elsa up.
[522.44 → 523.78] There are lots of good counsellors in our city,
[523.78 → 526.72] but I can speak very kindly of your whole practice
[526.72 → 527.80] as people who follow Jesus
[527.80 → 530.00] and seek to bring Jesus healing into the work of counselling.
[530.48 → 531.76] But take seriously that pull
[531.76 → 533.80] and that conviction to see a counsellor.
[536.28 → 537.74] If you, I don't know if you know this,
[537.78 → 539.22] but if you did the coldest night of the year walk,
[539.28 → 541.52] you actually walked right by Soul Care Counselling
[541.52 → 543.34] because they're right downtown Coverdale,
[543.50 → 544.44] they're right beside the vault.
[544.88 → 547.72] Actually, in their building, which was a bank,
[547.98 → 549.40] there's a chapel that is a vault,
[549.52 → 551.48] which is creepy and beautiful at the same time.
[552.36 → 554.94] But they're right beside Cross ridge Church.
[555.32 → 558.34] Yeah, right in between Cross ridge and the vault, yeah.
[560.76 → 562.74] I'm wondering if you want to say a little bit more
[562.74 → 566.50] about what people can expect in the process of counselling.
[566.60 → 567.56] I think there are a lot of nerves,
[567.72 → 569.04] a lot of, and I'll speak for men,
[569.16 → 570.34] oftentimes there's that sense of like,
[570.44 → 572.22] ah, I don't know if I want to see a counsellor
[572.22 → 573.18] and talk about my mess.
[573.18 → 575.74] How do you help people overcome that barrier of saying,
[576.00 → 576.78] you know, do you know?
[578.64 → 581.58] Well, I think the first thing for me
[581.58 → 582.68] that was really important,
[582.86 → 584.16] so as Dave said,
[584.88 → 588.56] I rented this massive space
[588.56 → 590.68] in the middle of the pandemic,
[591.16 → 594.38] which was, well, I thought it was a brilliant idea.
[594.52 → 595.46] Lots of people didn't.
[597.44 → 600.70] But what I really wanted was to create a space
[600.70 → 603.00] that felt safe and warm
[603.00 → 604.82] where people could come in
[604.82 → 607.52] and automatically feel like they could be themselves,
[607.94 → 609.64] that there was no expectation,
[610.54 → 612.98] and that people could really go at their own pace.
[613.70 → 617.46] And so as much as there's no barrier in the financial piece,
[617.60 → 619.86] and we want people to be able to come
[619.86 → 621.98] and pay whatever they can afford,
[622.40 → 624.82] we also wanted them to walk in the front door
[624.82 → 627.98] and feel like, oh, okay, I can manage this.
[627.98 → 631.28] And so the aesthetics in the office are very different
[631.28 → 634.58] than what you'd consider a clinical practice to be.
[635.32 → 639.42] So that's the first thing that I think helps.
[639.82 → 641.72] The second thing I think that helps
[641.72 → 643.36] is that at our clinic,
[643.54 → 647.94] we're really looking for creating community with our clients.
[647.94 → 651.88] So we don't want them to come in and tell their problem
[651.88 → 653.70] and then sneak out the back door
[653.70 → 657.36] as though their problem is the only thing that we care about.
[657.78 → 659.60] We want them to linger longer.
[660.12 → 662.80] We want them to come in, make a cup of tea.
[662.96 → 664.98] Sometimes we make them a cup of tea or coffee.
[665.26 → 666.54] I'm sorry, I'm a tea snob.
[667.10 → 668.82] But there's coffee there too.
[668.82 → 672.56] So we have a beautiful antique coffee bar
[672.56 → 674.88] where they can come and make a beverage.
[675.06 → 677.68] There's a library where they can borrow a book.
[678.16 → 681.06] There's a creative studio with looms
[681.06 → 683.72] so they can sit and sort of connect
[683.72 → 685.50] with that creative part of themselves.
[685.70 → 687.90] And I think through that connect with the divine,
[688.36 → 690.04] there is that chapel at the back,
[690.20 → 691.60] which I think is really cool.
[691.86 → 692.20] That's beautiful.
[692.96 → 694.46] And it is in the vault.
[694.84 → 696.38] So it echoes when you walk in.
[696.44 → 698.00] It's kind of like going into a mini cathedral.
[698.82 → 701.78] But all these common spaces are really meant
[701.78 → 703.36] for people to hang out longer.
[703.88 → 706.86] And when they do, we get to know them differently.
[707.20 → 707.42] Right?
[707.48 → 710.44] And we get to say, hey, all the parts of you are welcome here.
[710.48 → 711.68] I want to know about all of you.
[712.76 → 715.38] Maybe sometimes we'll talk about the weather or your dog
[715.38 → 717.32] or our dogs because we have therapy dogs there.
[718.02 → 719.74] Maybe we'll talk about something deeper.
[720.54 → 722.46] Maybe we'll talk about Christ.
[722.62 → 723.12] I don't know.
[723.24 → 724.74] I'm game for pretty much anything.
[725.98 → 727.88] And so that's what we're after.
[727.88 → 730.08] That's, I think, what makes it a little bit different
[730.08 → 733.40] and hopefully helps people feel comfortable
[733.40 → 736.08] coming to just share what they need to share.
[738.38 → 739.68] Well, I want to tell you, Elsa,
[739.80 → 742.28] like when I got to know you very recently
[742.28 → 743.54] and learned of what you're doing,
[743.64 → 745.14] I really think it's an answer to prayer.
[745.50 → 746.60] Already two years ago,
[746.74 → 748.36] as a leadership team in our church,
[748.36 → 750.16] we were talking about how is it that we as a church
[750.16 → 752.78] can support people with the huge challenges
[752.78 → 754.24] of mental health after the pandemic.
[754.24 → 756.10] And then we find out a year and a half later
[756.10 → 758.00] that there's this woman in our family who moved to town
[758.00 → 759.92] and they want to set up a counselling practice
[759.92 → 760.78] and they follow Jesus
[760.78 → 761.92] and they want to bring the life
[761.92 → 764.22] and the healing work of Jesus right to anyone,
[764.74 → 765.96] including people who can't afford it,
[766.04 → 766.50] in our city.
[766.62 → 767.96] And we praise the Lord for that.
[768.12 → 769.52] We see you as an answer to prayer.
[769.86 → 770.30] Thank you.
[770.44 → 771.48] And maybe a good way to finish this,
[771.54 → 772.06] just ask you,
[772.14 → 773.12] how can we pray for you?
[773.12 → 779.00] Well, yeah, I'm on my knees a decent amount.
[779.22 → 782.38] I'll offer that.
[783.20 → 784.76] I think, you know,
[784.80 → 787.50] when I first started this practice many years ago,
[788.08 → 790.70] even before I graduated,
[791.10 → 793.88] I made it a habitual prayer
[793.88 → 798.36] to ask God to send who needed to come
[798.36 → 801.32] because I don't know who those people are.
[802.34 → 804.58] And they're going to come into my life for time
[804.58 → 806.12] and then they're going to go out, right?
[806.16 → 806.84] They don't stay.
[807.44 → 810.16] And ultimately, God has control over all of that.
[810.72 → 815.60] And so to ask God to send who needs to come,
[816.08 → 819.68] to equip myself and my fellow counsellors
[819.68 → 820.48] and my students
[820.48 → 824.80] to really ask and acknowledge
[824.80 → 826.30] that God is in the room
[826.30 → 828.04] and that, you know,
[828.54 → 832.46] I didn't say this in the first session,
[832.70 → 835.22] but sometimes when I'm counselling,
[835.42 → 836.50] stuff comes out of my mouth.
[836.58 → 839.30] I'm like, where did that come from?
[839.80 → 840.08] Right?
[840.38 → 841.34] But I've prayed.
[841.54 → 842.62] I prayed this morning
[842.62 → 844.46] that God would give me the words.
[844.76 → 845.90] And so I just got to honour
[845.90 → 847.26] that that's what's going on.
[847.30 → 849.42] And it's amazing what happens.
[849.42 → 851.76] And so just that God would infuse
[851.76 → 854.34] all the parts of that practice
[854.34 → 858.00] and that I would just be a faithful servant.
[860.08 → 861.08] Well, would you join me?
[861.14 → 862.00] I'm going to pray for Elsa
[862.00 → 862.90] for that very thing.
[863.04 → 863.54] So let's pray.
[865.20 → 866.28] Father, we thank you
[866.28 → 867.88] for the gifts you've given Elsa.
[867.94 → 869.08] We thank you for moving her
[869.08 → 871.10] and Peter and Rachel into our city.
[872.14 → 874.80] We ask for your blessing on her practice.
[875.70 → 876.84] We thank you for the way
[876.84 → 878.88] in which she sacrificially serves.
[879.42 → 880.88] The way in which she wants people
[880.88 → 881.48] who are vulnerable
[881.48 → 883.22] on the margins to receive care.
[884.00 → 885.06] And we ask for your blessing
[885.06 → 886.10] to flow into our city
[886.10 → 888.44] through the days and hours of care
[888.44 → 889.60] that happens in our office.
[890.24 → 891.32] We pray for healing.
[892.10 → 893.12] We pray for conversion
[893.12 → 894.44] to take place through that work.
[895.20 → 896.76] Would you make her, her family,
[896.88 → 897.92] and this practice a blessing
[897.92 → 899.54] such that our city is impacted
[899.54 → 900.48] by the work of Jesus
[900.48 → 902.04] and his healing and transformation
[902.04 → 903.82] through the work of counselling.
[904.64 → 905.32] Strengthen her.
[906.18 → 907.00] Give her perseverance.
[907.00 → 908.00] And Lord, for the people
[908.00 → 909.60] who need your care in this season,
[909.68 → 910.82] we pray that you would move them
[910.82 → 912.34] to receive the care they require.
[913.12 → 914.48] We pray this in your mighty name.
[914.90 → 915.12] Amen.
[917.02 → 918.02] Thank you so much
[918.02 → 919.08] for giving us your time
[919.08 → 920.72] and sharing about your counselling practice
[920.72 → 921.22] in Coverdale.
[921.46 → 921.96] You're welcome.
[922.46 → 922.78] Thank you.
[922.78 → 932.36] This time I'm going to invite Sandy Beck
[932.36 → 933.54] to lead us in community prayer.
[944.02 → 946.40] We're going to continue our series in Lent.
[947.06 → 947.86] If you were here last week,
[947.90 → 949.78] you'll know that we started this series
[949.78 → 951.46] by preaching on Jesus'
[951.94 → 953.70] perhaps most unpopular promise.
[954.44 → 956.16] And that is from John 16, 33,
[956.16 → 957.38] where he says to the church,
[958.06 → 959.28] I promise that in this world
[959.28 → 960.16] you will have trouble.
[961.54 → 962.38] But take heart.
[962.46 → 963.42] I've overcome the world.
[964.46 → 965.36] And for the next number of weeks,
[965.42 → 966.60] we're looking at particular ways
[966.60 → 967.68] that we experience suffering
[967.68 → 969.98] and hardship and pain and sorrow.
[970.66 → 971.78] And then asking,
[971.88 → 973.44] how does Jesus, our suffering servant,
[973.54 → 974.64] not just minister to us,
[974.70 → 976.40] but enter into our suffering
[976.40 → 978.40] and enable us to be faithful
[978.40 → 980.04] in our seasons of pain
[980.04 → 981.30] and our places of struggle?
[982.20 → 983.18] And the first place
[983.18 → 984.08] that we're going to spend time
[984.08 → 985.08] looking at this morning,
[985.40 → 985.98] thank you, Bill.
[986.04 → 986.78] That was a good sneeze.
[988.20 → 989.68] It's just a good sneeze every time.
[990.76 → 992.24] We're going to be looking at work.
[992.90 → 993.86] And if you have your Bible,
[993.98 → 995.00] I invite you to turn with me
[995.00 → 996.22] to Genesis chapter 3.
[996.32 → 997.94] We're going to look at how this passage
[997.94 → 998.74] gives us a vision
[998.74 → 1001.18] and a clarity about our work.
[1001.48 → 1002.32] This is Genesis 3,
[1002.44 → 1003.50] starting in verse 17.
[1006.40 → 1010.46] To Adam, God said,
[1011.28 → 1012.74] Because you listened to your wife
[1012.74 → 1013.92] and ate from the tree
[1013.92 → 1015.10] about which I commanded you,
[1015.18 → 1016.26] you must not eat of it.
[1016.96 → 1019.06] Cursed is the ground because of you.
[1019.68 → 1020.58] Through painful toil,
[1020.70 → 1021.38] you will eat of it
[1021.38 → 1022.74] all the days of your life.
[1023.34 → 1024.42] It will produce thorns
[1024.42 → 1025.64] and thistles for you,
[1025.80 → 1026.72] and you will eat the plants
[1026.72 → 1027.28] of the field.
[1027.88 → 1029.06] By the sweat of your brow,
[1029.14 → 1029.98] you will eat your food
[1029.98 → 1031.62] until you return to the ground,
[1032.18 → 1033.48] since from it, you were taken.
[1034.12 → 1035.46] For dust you are,
[1035.46 → 1038.24] and to dust you will return.
[1042.48 → 1043.68] Over the last couple of years,
[1043.78 → 1044.34] there's actually been
[1044.34 → 1045.74] quite a bit of literature written
[1045.74 → 1046.96] about millennials,
[1047.16 → 1048.20] which is my generation,
[1048.88 → 1050.48] and Gen Z, or Zed,
[1050.94 → 1052.18] which is the generation below me.
[1052.26 → 1054.02] And the focus of some of that writing
[1054.02 → 1055.22] has been work.
[1056.30 → 1057.76] You see, there's this new trend,
[1057.82 → 1059.02] and I'm sure many of you are aware of it,
[1059.08 → 1060.42] where Gen Z and millennials,
[1060.80 → 1061.92] we quit our jobs
[1061.92 → 1063.02] more regularly
[1063.02 → 1064.20] than the older generation.
[1064.20 → 1065.12] And boomers,
[1065.26 → 1066.86] we know you make fun of us for this.
[1067.18 → 1068.20] Don't you deny it.
[1068.26 → 1069.34] You make fun of us for this.
[1069.40 → 1070.88] We quit our jobs quite regularly.
[1072.24 → 1073.22] And if you remember,
[1073.32 → 1074.54] even a year and a half ago,
[1074.66 → 1075.50] during the pandemic,
[1076.04 → 1077.86] about six months into the pandemic,
[1078.00 → 1078.90] there was this title,
[1079.02 → 1079.58] this tagline,
[1079.64 → 1080.66] that was showing up in the news,
[1080.72 → 1081.32] and it was called
[1081.32 → 1082.20] The Great Resignation.
[1082.84 → 1083.48] Do you remember this?
[1084.04 → 1085.20] The Great Resignation
[1085.20 → 1085.98] was this moment
[1085.98 → 1087.42] where a lot of young employees
[1087.42 → 1088.14] thought,
[1088.24 → 1088.60] you know what,
[1088.68 → 1089.60] life is too short
[1089.60 → 1091.02] for me to work in this job
[1091.02 → 1091.68] that I hate.
[1091.68 → 1092.70] So I quit,
[1092.78 → 1094.02] and I'm going to go find something better.
[1095.16 → 1097.02] Eight months later or so,
[1097.16 → 1098.38] there was a new set of articles
[1098.38 → 1099.18] that were showing up,
[1099.24 → 1100.56] and guess what the title of those were?
[1101.50 → 1102.70] The Great Regret.
[1103.72 → 1104.84] And the reason is,
[1105.10 → 1106.36] what those people who quit,
[1106.42 → 1107.14] and maybe some of us
[1107.14 → 1108.40] are among that group,
[1108.52 → 1109.32] what they realized
[1109.32 → 1110.76] when they got that next job is,
[1111.14 → 1112.60] that job is tough too.
[1112.92 → 1113.84] And they kind of wish
[1113.84 → 1115.04] they stuck with the first job
[1115.04 → 1116.02] that was also tough,
[1116.26 → 1117.14] and so it went.
[1117.14 → 1119.44] Now, I have this hunch.
[1119.98 → 1121.06] I can't prove it,
[1121.18 → 1122.28] but my hunch is this.
[1122.54 → 1124.14] The reason so many millennials
[1124.14 → 1125.64] and Gen Z quit their job
[1125.64 → 1126.34] is not because
[1126.34 → 1127.56] it's the worst job in the world.
[1127.68 → 1130.64] It's because the shine wears off.
[1131.42 → 1133.60] That bubble of idealism
[1133.60 → 1135.56] about their work being perfect pops,
[1136.12 → 1137.00] and what they want to do
[1137.00 → 1138.16] instead of facing the reality
[1138.16 → 1138.84] of its hardship
[1138.84 → 1140.18] is walked away.
[1142.58 → 1144.36] Perhaps you can relate to that.
[1144.36 → 1147.00] Now, I want to name something
[1147.00 → 1148.68] that we often don't talk enough about
[1148.68 → 1149.24] in the church,
[1149.58 → 1150.30] and that is this,
[1150.38 → 1151.30] simply this.
[1151.92 → 1154.50] Work is hard.
[1155.20 → 1156.02] Can we say that?
[1156.86 → 1159.02] Work can be very hard.
[1159.52 → 1161.30] It can be extremely frustrating,
[1161.36 → 1162.50] the thing that keeps you up at night
[1162.50 → 1164.62] because it's so difficult.
[1165.70 → 1167.28] I think we need to name in the church
[1167.28 → 1168.92] that we have this idealism,
[1169.00 → 1170.66] sometimes for our whole lives,
[1170.72 → 1171.42] that somehow,
[1171.80 → 1172.52] there's going to be
[1172.52 → 1174.08] this perfect job for us
[1174.08 → 1174.86] that's going to have
[1174.86 → 1176.66] the great benefits.
[1176.86 → 1177.44] It's going to have
[1177.44 → 1178.78] the great team environment.
[1178.90 → 1179.48] It's going to give you
[1179.48 → 1181.14] a gourmet coffee bar
[1181.14 → 1181.88] and great people
[1181.88 → 1182.82] to work with and for.
[1182.88 → 1184.24] It's going to have stock options.
[1184.32 → 1185.22] It's going to change the world
[1185.22 → 1186.46] and pay a lot of money,
[1186.84 → 1187.88] and that work
[1187.88 → 1188.96] never seems to show up,
[1189.92 → 1191.28] and you often can go.
[1191.40 → 1192.34] You start your job
[1192.34 → 1193.80] with a sense of wistful optimism
[1193.80 → 1195.02] that you're going to change the world.
[1195.08 → 1195.90] This job's going to be amazing,
[1196.26 → 1197.48] and already six months in,
[1197.52 → 1197.80] you're like,
[1197.88 → 1198.84] what is going on?
[1198.86 → 1199.94] I wasted my degree.
[1200.18 → 1201.32] I wasted my time.
[1201.32 → 1202.80] I never should have pursued this job,
[1202.92 → 1204.22] and you're like 30 years old
[1204.22 → 1204.76] and jaded
[1204.76 → 1207.14] because no one told you
[1207.14 → 1209.44] that work is hard.
[1210.88 → 1213.20] I want to paint a few situations for us
[1213.20 → 1214.90] that come actually from our church
[1214.90 → 1216.06] and from people I know,
[1216.18 → 1217.38] so none of these are hypothetical.
[1218.46 → 1219.98] Imagine that you work in the trades.
[1220.44 → 1221.08] You're a framer,
[1221.26 → 1221.76] a carpenter,
[1221.90 → 1222.54] a sub-trade.
[1222.88 → 1224.08] You've got a job to do
[1224.08 → 1224.82] and a certain deadline,
[1224.92 → 1225.56] but you've got workers
[1225.56 → 1226.52] who just don't show up.
[1226.70 → 1227.28] You've got workers
[1227.28 → 1228.54] who say they'll come but don't,
[1228.54 → 1230.14] and you fall behind in your schedule
[1230.14 → 1230.70] and all of a sudden
[1230.70 → 1232.72] the contractor is furious with you
[1232.72 → 1233.52] because your people
[1233.52 → 1234.62] aren't showing up on time.
[1235.24 → 1236.04] You're frustrated.
[1236.98 → 1238.64] Or you've been given the task
[1238.64 → 1239.64] to cast a vision
[1239.64 → 1241.62] for how your company's going to pivot
[1241.62 → 1243.52] now that there's this new economic reality.
[1243.76 → 1245.68] You work hard on that for over a year,
[1245.96 → 1248.06] and then comes this co-worker
[1248.06 → 1249.86] who is emotionally immature,
[1250.14 → 1251.82] who wants the promotion you're going for,
[1252.00 → 1253.86] and they sabotage your work
[1253.86 → 1255.62] in the most unhealthy kind of way.
[1255.62 → 1258.88] Perhaps you finally get the job
[1258.88 → 1260.38] that you hoped you would get
[1260.38 → 1263.00] in that really well-established company,
[1263.58 → 1264.68] and about three months in,
[1264.74 → 1266.58] you realize that your little cubicle job
[1266.58 → 1267.74] on floor number four
[1267.74 → 1269.72] isn't changing the world.
[1269.84 → 1271.50] It doesn't feel that meaningful,
[1271.68 → 1273.32] and the daily grind is way more
[1273.32 → 1273.84] than you thought
[1273.84 → 1274.88] you were getting yourself into.
[1276.40 → 1277.60] Or how about this?
[1278.22 → 1280.08] You get the job you dreamed of
[1280.08 → 1280.96] since you were a kid.
[1281.52 → 1282.48] The job everyone said
[1282.48 → 1283.60] you'd be the perfect fit for.
[1283.60 → 1284.60] You land that job,
[1284.66 → 1286.34] and you learn very quickly
[1286.34 → 1288.10] it doesn't pay the bills.
[1288.48 → 1289.90] And you then have to ask,
[1290.00 → 1291.20] do I keep the job
[1291.20 → 1292.76] and sacrifice a lot,
[1292.90 → 1293.96] or do I find a job
[1293.96 → 1295.16] that takes care of my family
[1295.16 → 1296.16] but I don't love?
[1297.52 → 1299.42] Work is hard.
[1300.66 → 1301.54] And something tells me,
[1301.58 → 1302.56] even as I share this,
[1302.70 → 1303.54] you're thinking of
[1303.54 → 1305.28] the hard work in your life.
[1306.54 → 1308.36] And then we read Genesis 3,
[1308.36 → 1310.92] the sobering statement of reality.
[1311.54 → 1313.40] Cursed is the ground because of you.
[1313.88 → 1314.88] Through painful toil,
[1315.02 → 1315.80] you'll eat from it
[1315.80 → 1317.18] all the days of your life.
[1317.40 → 1319.56] It will produce thorns and thistles,
[1320.08 → 1321.70] and you'll eat from the plants of the field.
[1321.78 → 1323.88] By the sweat of your brow,
[1324.56 → 1325.66] you will eat your food.
[1326.64 → 1329.18] Genesis 3 is all about life after Eden.
[1329.44 → 1330.52] And if you were here last week,
[1330.86 → 1331.90] we talked about how pain,
[1332.14 → 1333.46] sorrow, and trials, and suffering,
[1333.54 → 1334.78] they come into the story
[1334.78 → 1336.52] after the good beginning,
[1336.94 → 1337.66] the good creation,
[1337.76 → 1338.28] the good world.
[1338.28 → 1339.76] And then comes Genesis 3
[1339.76 → 1341.76] where there's deception from Satan
[1341.76 → 1343.72] that leads to rebellion from humans,
[1343.90 → 1345.86] that leads to the corruption of this world
[1345.86 → 1347.86] in the reality we name sin.
[1348.98 → 1351.48] And none of us can seem to escape it.
[1352.20 → 1353.44] There's this painful thing
[1353.44 → 1355.04] that surrounds all of our work.
[1355.14 → 1355.86] All of a sudden,
[1356.24 → 1357.46] everything got hard.
[1359.16 → 1360.62] Now, one of the things about this passage
[1360.62 → 1362.42] that seems to catch a lot of people's attention
[1362.42 → 1364.10] is that word curse.
[1365.18 → 1366.28] If you didn't grow up in the church
[1366.28 → 1367.86] or you didn't grow up reading Genesis 3,
[1367.94 → 1368.88] you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1369.18 → 1370.34] Why are we reading a passage
[1370.34 → 1372.52] where God is cursing first a serpent,
[1372.96 → 1374.66] which is by itself weird to a lot of people,
[1374.88 → 1376.04] then he's cursing Eve,
[1376.10 → 1377.34] and then he's cursing Adam.
[1377.42 → 1379.36] Like, what is this?
[1379.94 → 1380.88] And I just want to emphasize
[1380.88 → 1381.90] and make very clear
[1381.90 → 1383.88] that this is not some, like, Harry Potter scene
[1383.88 → 1386.00] where God is, like, casting a spell
[1386.00 → 1387.04] on Adam and Eve
[1387.04 → 1388.66] or there's some bad omen he's sending.
[1389.16 → 1389.94] Curse in the Bible
[1389.94 → 1391.12] is maybe simply put
[1391.12 → 1392.74] the removal of blessing.
[1394.36 → 1395.86] Curse is allowing the consequences
[1395.86 → 1397.32] of sin to be felt.
[1397.74 → 1398.62] And I want to read for you
[1398.62 → 1399.32] how Tim Mickey,
[1399.38 → 1400.34] one Old Testament writer,
[1400.48 → 1401.66] puts this passage
[1401.66 → 1402.86] into perspective on curse.
[1402.96 → 1403.40] He writes,
[1403.90 → 1404.52] in the Bible,
[1405.26 → 1407.00] curse is when God hands people
[1407.00 → 1408.26] over to the consequences
[1408.26 → 1410.54] of seizing our blessing
[1410.54 → 1412.48] on our own terms.
[1413.40 → 1414.72] And we do that all the time, by the way.
[1414.78 → 1415.90] God gives us design
[1415.90 → 1416.92] for how we live our lives
[1416.92 → 1417.16] and we're like,
[1417.22 → 1418.92] actually, we'll find blessing this way.
[1419.00 → 1419.82] We'll do things this way.
[1419.86 → 1420.90] We'll take charge from here.
[1421.12 → 1421.88] And we find ourselves
[1421.88 → 1422.92] living in a lot of pain,
[1423.22 → 1423.90] a lot of toil,
[1423.98 → 1424.82] and a lot of frustration.
[1425.12 → 1427.60] That is life under the curse.
[1428.66 → 1430.40] Trying to live on our own terms.
[1430.52 → 1431.64] And did you notice, by the way,
[1431.94 → 1433.72] the first thing that experiences
[1433.72 → 1434.70] the curse in this passage,
[1434.78 → 1435.18] what is it?
[1436.36 → 1437.32] It's the ground.
[1438.20 → 1438.88] Isn't that interesting?
[1439.36 → 1441.32] That somehow the creation itself
[1441.32 → 1443.28] is corrupted and made different
[1443.28 → 1444.74] as a result of human rebellion
[1444.74 → 1446.00] that affects the whole world.
[1446.42 → 1447.40] There's a sense in which
[1447.40 → 1449.44] what was once a really lush,
[1449.58 → 1450.24] beautiful garden
[1450.24 → 1451.02] for Adam and Eve
[1451.02 → 1452.60] to enjoy, cultivate, care for,
[1452.72 → 1454.56] and receive abundant harvest from
[1454.56 → 1456.12] becomes a hard soil
[1456.12 → 1457.98] that is filled with thistles
[1457.98 → 1458.80] and thorns.
[1459.98 → 1461.38] And then the labour,
[1461.58 → 1462.14] as a result,
[1462.22 → 1463.40] is no longer life-giving
[1463.40 → 1464.68] and satisfying and joyful.
[1465.08 → 1466.02] It's frustrating.
[1466.68 → 1467.74] It's difficult.
[1468.30 → 1469.72] There's sweat on the brow.
[1469.82 → 1470.68] And from Genesis 1,
[1470.76 → 1472.02] you get this vision,
[1472.10 → 1472.68] very important,
[1472.68 → 1473.86] of work happening
[1473.86 → 1474.68] that is life-giving
[1474.68 → 1475.92] and meaningful and good.
[1476.08 → 1477.32] Because work is life-giving
[1477.32 → 1478.28] and meaningful and good.
[1478.54 → 1479.46] And now in Genesis 3,
[1479.82 → 1481.28] it's sweat on the brow
[1481.28 → 1482.92] in a difficult creation
[1482.92 → 1484.28] where there is pain
[1484.28 → 1485.64] and thorn and thistles.
[1486.52 → 1487.64] And that's not just a statement,
[1487.76 → 1488.22] by the way,
[1488.88 → 1490.88] about the world in Genesis 3
[1490.88 → 1491.48] and Adam and Eve
[1491.48 → 1492.50] in this particular place.
[1492.54 → 1493.16] That is a statement
[1493.16 → 1494.86] about every single person's work
[1494.86 → 1496.70] in every single corner
[1496.70 → 1497.36] of the world.
[1497.44 → 1498.30] Whether you're an accountant
[1498.30 → 1499.90] or a farmer
[1499.90 → 1501.90] or just a stay-at-home mom.
[1501.90 → 1502.74] Oh, I just said.
[1502.80 → 1503.48] My wife will kill me.
[1503.54 → 1504.72] Or you're a stay-at-home mom
[1504.72 → 1505.80] or dad.
[1506.54 → 1507.40] Or you're working
[1507.40 → 1508.80] on the fourth floor corner office
[1508.80 → 1509.84] of some fancy firm.
[1510.22 → 1511.28] We all experience
[1511.28 → 1512.58] the thorns and the thistles.
[1513.12 → 1514.18] And surely you've asked
[1514.18 → 1514.96] the question before
[1514.96 → 1515.76] in your workplace
[1515.76 → 1516.86] with the paid
[1516.86 → 1518.16] or unpaid work that you do.
[1518.38 → 1518.78] The question,
[1519.10 → 1520.72] why does it have to be this hard?
[1521.42 → 1522.38] Have you ever asked that question?
[1522.86 → 1523.90] Why does it have to be
[1523.90 → 1525.20] so difficult
[1525.20 → 1527.82] to get this job done on time?
[1528.68 → 1529.96] Why is it so hard
[1529.96 → 1531.04] to move this company
[1531.04 → 1532.24] away from this time
[1532.24 → 1532.76] that wastes
[1532.76 → 1534.28] into a more productive way
[1534.28 → 1534.98] of doing business?
[1535.30 → 1536.50] Why is it so hard
[1536.50 → 1537.68] to hand this job over
[1537.68 → 1538.12] to someone
[1538.12 → 1538.98] and not worry
[1538.98 → 1540.00] that they're going to wreck it?
[1540.74 → 1542.66] Why can't my body do
[1542.66 → 1544.04] what I love to do
[1544.04 → 1544.94] as I get older
[1544.94 → 1546.16] and feel the age
[1546.16 → 1546.76] and the pain?
[1547.82 → 1549.50] Why can't I trust
[1549.50 → 1550.34] my coworkers?
[1551.26 → 1552.54] Why does my best idea
[1552.54 → 1553.44] get sabotaged
[1553.44 → 1555.04] by emotionally unhealthy people?
[1555.82 → 1557.18] Why is my mental health
[1557.18 → 1558.24] in such a bad place
[1558.24 → 1558.96] that I can't do
[1558.96 → 1559.76] full-time work
[1559.76 → 1560.44] that I love?
[1560.76 → 1561.76] And why does the job
[1561.76 → 1562.86] I love never become
[1562.86 → 1563.92] possible for me?
[1564.48 → 1565.40] These are just a few
[1565.40 → 1565.94] of the questions
[1565.94 → 1567.02] we ask that open up
[1567.02 → 1568.16] the reality of thorns
[1568.16 → 1569.30] and thistles
[1569.30 → 1570.38] in a world
[1570.38 → 1571.22] that experiences
[1571.22 → 1572.02] the curse.
[1573.50 → 1573.96] Work
[1573.96 → 1575.70] is hard.
[1577.18 → 1578.10] But I want to name
[1578.10 → 1578.72] now something
[1578.72 → 1579.40] that we touched on
[1579.40 → 1580.10] last week again.
[1580.18 → 1581.16] That work in this world
[1581.16 → 1581.58] is hard
[1581.58 → 1582.52] and everyone experiences
[1582.52 → 1583.28] the thorn and thistles.
[1583.34 → 1584.22] No matter what you believe,
[1584.30 → 1585.10] no matter where you go,
[1585.34 → 1586.50] work will always be hard.
[1586.50 → 1587.78] But there's a specific
[1587.78 → 1588.60] kind of hard,
[1588.92 → 1590.06] a specific kind of trouble
[1590.06 → 1591.18] that Christians will experience
[1591.18 → 1591.60] in the work
[1591.60 → 1593.06] almost inevitably
[1593.06 → 1594.92] as we live in a secular society.
[1596.20 → 1596.96] There's something
[1596.96 → 1597.94] about following Jesus
[1597.94 → 1599.78] in our work
[1599.78 → 1601.24] that makes it difficult.
[1602.22 → 1602.82] I want to give you
[1602.82 → 1603.70] just a few examples.
[1604.98 → 1606.44] Perhaps there's a normal way
[1606.44 → 1607.20] of cutting corners
[1607.20 → 1607.86] in your industry,
[1608.02 → 1608.48] your business,
[1608.62 → 1609.34] your job site.
[1610.06 → 1611.72] That is okay for everybody,
[1611.84 → 1612.96] but it's not okay for you.
[1613.34 → 1614.24] And as a result
[1614.24 → 1615.46] of not cutting corners,
[1615.46 → 1617.42] of not taking the easy road
[1617.42 → 1618.34] or finding a way
[1618.34 → 1619.56] around tax and all that,
[1619.82 → 1620.78] and when you don't do that,
[1620.84 → 1621.46] you get mocked.
[1622.18 → 1622.78] And I know people
[1622.78 → 1623.44] in our church
[1623.44 → 1625.16] who have been mocked
[1625.16 → 1626.18] for being a person
[1626.18 → 1626.72] of integrity
[1626.72 → 1627.36] in their work
[1627.36 → 1627.92] when the industry
[1627.92 → 1629.12] is okay with cutting corners.
[1630.40 → 1631.32] Perhaps it's naming
[1631.32 → 1632.02] to your boss
[1632.02 → 1633.14] that you are not willing
[1633.14 → 1634.36] to do a certain kind of work
[1634.36 → 1635.42] because it compromises
[1635.42 → 1636.04] your faith.
[1636.68 → 1637.44] It goes against
[1637.44 → 1638.06] what you believe.
[1638.14 → 1638.54] And I know,
[1638.62 → 1639.08] if you were here
[1639.08 → 1641.22] 2017 or 2018,
[1641.36 → 1642.20] we interviewed John,
[1642.30 → 1643.02] who's an animator,
[1643.02 → 1644.94] and John shared a story
[1644.94 → 1645.56] where he had to meet
[1645.56 → 1646.26] with his boss
[1646.26 → 1647.50] and say to his boss
[1647.50 → 1649.14] of a very big animation company,
[1649.66 → 1651.20] I will not do animation
[1651.20 → 1653.66] of sexually explicit material
[1653.66 → 1655.18] because I follow Jesus
[1655.18 → 1656.26] and it's a boundary
[1656.26 → 1656.94] in my life.
[1658.00 → 1658.90] And he had to put himself
[1658.90 → 1659.42] out there
[1659.42 → 1660.84] because he realized
[1660.84 → 1661.72] that to be faithful
[1661.72 → 1662.72] to Jesus in his work
[1662.72 → 1664.24] required naming the reality
[1664.24 → 1665.32] that there are certain things
[1665.32 → 1666.50] he will not do.
[1667.52 → 1668.54] Or how about this one?
[1669.46 → 1670.62] Not being willing
[1670.62 → 1672.26] to take the promotion,
[1672.74 → 1673.72] take the job hike,
[1673.88 → 1674.90] and the better position
[1674.90 → 1676.00] because you are unwilling
[1676.00 → 1677.86] to sacrifice your family
[1677.86 → 1679.60] on the altar of work.
[1680.70 → 1682.78] It is an acceptable vice
[1682.78 → 1683.74] in the Western world
[1683.74 → 1684.68] to be a workaholic.
[1685.16 → 1685.76] And in the community
[1685.76 → 1686.30] I grew up in,
[1686.34 → 1687.16] the Dutch subculture,
[1687.52 → 1688.94] workaholism was a virtue.
[1690.08 → 1691.68] But for those who follow Jesus,
[1691.92 → 1692.26] it doesn't matter
[1692.26 → 1693.34] what culture you are,
[1693.90 → 1695.10] we are not permitted
[1695.10 → 1696.50] to sacrifice our spouse
[1696.50 → 1697.30] and our children
[1697.30 → 1698.80] on the altar of work.
[1699.20 → 1700.22] And there may come a season
[1700.22 → 1700.78] where you say,
[1701.00 → 1702.06] I will not take the job
[1702.06 → 1702.94] that pays me more money.
[1703.10 → 1704.24] I will not take the position
[1704.24 → 1704.98] with higher authority
[1704.98 → 1706.16] because I've got young kids
[1706.16 → 1706.60] at home
[1706.60 → 1707.74] and my life
[1707.74 → 1708.94] and my commitment to Jesus
[1708.94 → 1710.90] demands my faithfulness
[1710.90 → 1712.58] in other spheres of my life
[1712.58 → 1714.64] and being okay with that.
[1715.62 → 1716.70] And there very well
[1716.70 → 1717.72] may come situations
[1717.72 → 1718.84] in many of our jobs
[1718.84 → 1720.64] where we simply have to speak up
[1720.64 → 1721.92] against a company policy
[1721.92 → 1723.38] that is not fair
[1723.38 → 1724.06] or faithful
[1724.06 → 1724.84] or just
[1724.84 → 1726.14] in many ways.
[1726.94 → 1727.60] I'm aware that
[1727.60 → 1728.40] in some of the jobs
[1728.40 → 1729.10] that you work in,
[1729.68 → 1730.36] you've been told
[1730.36 → 1731.02] or there's a policy
[1731.02 → 1731.94] that says you can't speak
[1731.94 → 1732.50] of your faith.
[1732.60 → 1732.90] You're not allowed
[1732.90 → 1733.52] to bring your faith
[1733.52 → 1734.18] into the classroom
[1734.18 → 1734.72] or the hallway
[1734.72 → 1735.46] or wherever it is
[1735.46 → 1735.92] that you work.
[1736.18 → 1737.02] And that's a problem
[1737.02 → 1738.62] because we are called
[1738.62 → 1739.56] to live and serve
[1739.56 → 1740.46] and follow and speak
[1740.46 → 1741.26] of King Jesus.
[1742.52 → 1743.72] And I think it's fair
[1743.72 → 1744.68] to also say
[1744.68 → 1746.44] that we should not assume
[1746.44 → 1747.78] that it will be easy
[1747.78 → 1749.18] for us in our workplaces
[1749.18 → 1750.26] in a secular world.
[1750.90 → 1751.68] We should not assume
[1751.68 → 1752.86] that it will be smooth sailing
[1752.86 → 1753.26] for us
[1753.26 → 1754.32] as we want to follow Jesus
[1754.32 → 1755.06] and be faithful
[1755.06 → 1755.74] in our workplaces
[1755.74 → 1757.00] that have different expectations,
[1757.44 → 1758.36] different ambitions
[1758.36 → 1759.46] than we do
[1759.46 → 1760.36] as followers of Jesus.
[1760.70 → 1761.58] We should expect
[1761.58 → 1762.06] that there will be
[1762.06 → 1762.88] difficult moments.
[1763.94 → 1765.02] There will be hard conversations
[1765.02 → 1766.06] that require brothers
[1766.06 → 1767.02] and sisters in faith
[1767.02 → 1767.40] to say,
[1767.74 → 1768.44] we're here with you.
[1768.84 → 1769.90] We will support you.
[1770.26 → 1770.94] We want to honour
[1770.94 → 1771.62] and care for you
[1771.62 → 1772.54] as you be faithful
[1772.54 → 1773.16] in the place
[1773.16 → 1774.24] that God has sent you.
[1774.24 → 1777.30] And so that brings me
[1777.30 → 1778.00] to the question,
[1779.40 → 1781.48] how is it that we live well
[1781.48 → 1783.38] and work well
[1783.38 → 1784.78] in the thorns and the thistles?
[1785.32 → 1786.38] How do we be people
[1786.38 → 1787.30] of blessing
[1787.30 → 1789.10] amidst the curse
[1789.10 → 1790.04] and the pain
[1790.04 → 1790.80] in this world?
[1791.54 → 1792.42] What is it
[1792.42 → 1793.64] that Jesus has for us,
[1793.68 → 1794.46] our suffering servant?
[1794.64 → 1795.42] What strength,
[1795.58 → 1796.02] encouragement,
[1796.30 → 1796.54] wisdom,
[1796.76 → 1797.14] insight
[1797.14 → 1798.62] does Jesus give us
[1798.62 → 1800.16] to do our work well
[1800.16 → 1800.92] with the short years
[1800.92 → 1801.40] we're given
[1801.40 → 1802.40] to work?
[1804.30 → 1805.12] The first thing
[1805.12 → 1805.98] I want to say about Jesus
[1805.98 → 1807.76] is that he understands
[1807.76 → 1808.26] our work.
[1809.40 → 1810.76] Before his three years,
[1810.84 → 1811.76] and he only had
[1811.76 → 1812.40] three years
[1812.40 → 1813.22] of public ministry
[1813.22 → 1814.18] from 30 to 33,
[1814.34 → 1815.24] before those years,
[1815.46 → 1815.92] the majority
[1815.92 → 1816.78] of his adult life
[1816.78 → 1818.32] was spent working.
[1819.88 → 1820.82] Jesus was a carpenter.
[1820.92 → 1821.14] In fact,
[1821.18 → 1821.98] in Mark chapter 6,
[1822.08 → 1823.06] Jesus was sort of accused
[1823.06 → 1823.84] of not being worth
[1823.84 → 1824.42] listening to
[1824.42 → 1825.04] because they said,
[1825.04 → 1826.22] this guy's a carpenter.
[1826.32 → 1826.92] What does he know?
[1827.46 → 1828.70] But Jesus clearly worked.
[1828.80 → 1829.70] He understood work.
[1829.78 → 1830.38] And there's no doubt
[1830.38 → 1830.82] in my mind
[1830.82 → 1831.54] that Jesus knew
[1831.54 → 1832.22] what it was like
[1832.22 → 1833.60] to have planks
[1833.60 → 1834.74] that wouldn't go straight
[1834.74 → 1835.30] and work well
[1835.30 → 1836.36] into furniture he's building
[1836.36 → 1837.96] or a tool that breaks
[1837.96 → 1838.96] and gets frustrating.
[1839.50 → 1840.30] Jesus knew what it was like
[1840.30 → 1840.92] to have a splinter
[1840.92 → 1841.92] that really hurts
[1841.92 → 1843.00] or to have a hammer
[1843.00 → 1844.26] that misses the wood
[1844.26 → 1844.80] or the nail
[1844.80 → 1845.58] and hits the thumb.
[1846.00 → 1846.78] And we have to ask,
[1846.88 → 1848.00] what would Jesus have said
[1848.00 → 1849.04] when that moment happened,
[1849.12 → 1849.30] right?
[1851.50 → 1852.82] He gets hard work.
[1853.56 → 1854.28] He really does.
[1854.28 → 1855.18] Jesus understands
[1855.18 → 1856.10] the unjust structures
[1856.10 → 1856.78] around the work
[1856.78 → 1857.18] that we do.
[1857.24 → 1858.56] He gets work.
[1858.56 → 1860.68] But more than that,
[1861.28 → 1862.16] Jesus, when he enters
[1862.16 → 1863.14] into his public ministry,
[1863.32 → 1865.58] teaches about how we do work
[1865.58 → 1867.38] as citizens of the kingdom of God.
[1868.14 → 1869.16] If I had more time
[1869.16 → 1869.56] in the sermon,
[1869.70 → 1871.12] I would spend a lot more time
[1871.12 → 1873.38] looking at just how the Sermon
[1873.38 → 1874.28] on the Mount alone,
[1874.84 → 1876.44] that is Matthew 5 to 7,
[1877.04 → 1878.42] teaches us how to be faithful
[1878.42 → 1878.86] in our work.
[1878.96 → 1880.24] It has so much for us
[1880.24 → 1880.98] about how we relate
[1880.98 → 1881.62] to our coworkers,
[1882.06 → 1882.88] deal with conflict
[1882.88 → 1883.50] and reconciliation,
[1883.90 → 1885.14] how we deal with our money,
[1885.14 → 1886.62] how we deal with those
[1886.62 → 1887.64] with whom we struggle with
[1887.64 → 1888.56] and have relationship with,
[1888.60 → 1889.52] how we speak to them.
[1889.74 → 1890.58] There's so much
[1890.58 → 1891.74] just in the Sermon on the Mount
[1891.74 → 1892.92] about how we do our work
[1892.92 → 1894.28] as followers of Jesus.
[1895.64 → 1896.88] But Jesus doesn't just
[1896.88 → 1898.06] understand us as a worker.
[1898.18 → 1899.50] He doesn't just instruct us
[1899.50 → 1900.14] as our Lord.
[1901.00 → 1902.40] Jesus came to release us
[1902.40 → 1903.10] from the curse.
[1904.80 → 1906.04] Jesus shows up
[1906.04 → 1907.88] as a result of God's promise
[1907.88 → 1908.66] in Genesis 3
[1908.66 → 1909.42] where he said,
[1910.18 → 1911.44] the offspring of Eve
[1911.44 → 1912.30] will crush the head
[1912.30 → 1912.72] of the serpent.
[1912.86 → 1914.24] Jesus shows up to do that.
[1914.24 → 1915.48] And in so doing,
[1915.62 → 1917.42] reverse the effects
[1917.42 → 1918.50] of the curse.
[1919.38 → 1920.50] And I kind of like this image
[1920.50 → 1921.74] of like in Genesis
[1921.74 → 1922.68] and throughout the Old Testament,
[1922.78 → 1924.38] there's this powerful torrent
[1924.38 → 1925.76] of sin that is creating
[1925.76 → 1926.94] so much pain in the world.
[1927.02 → 1928.10] It's moving in a certain direction
[1928.10 → 1929.36] and Jesus shows up,
[1929.50 → 1930.34] steps into the torrent
[1930.34 → 1932.44] and he reverses the trajectory.
[1932.76 → 1934.06] He undoes the suffering.
[1934.16 → 1935.40] He undoes the curse.
[1936.12 → 1937.48] And he does it by the cross.
[1938.24 → 1939.76] He takes the curse on himself.
[1940.32 → 1941.16] He takes the weight of it,
[1941.24 → 1941.82] the power of it,
[1941.86 → 1942.98] the brutality of it
[1942.98 → 1944.08] and he buries it
[1944.08 → 1944.78] as he dies
[1944.78 → 1945.74] and goes to the grave.
[1946.76 → 1948.40] And then in his resurrection,
[1949.20 → 1951.86] he opens up a new power
[1951.86 → 1953.92] for us to experience blessing.
[1955.30 → 1956.64] When the earliest disciples
[1956.64 → 1957.60] and earliest believers
[1957.60 → 1958.64] placed their trust
[1958.64 → 1959.34] and faith in Jesus,
[1959.48 → 1960.58] what they experienced
[1960.58 → 1962.80] was his power
[1962.80 → 1964.22] putting their lives
[1964.22 → 1964.88] back together
[1964.88 → 1966.04] the way they were created
[1966.04 → 1966.88] to be from the beginning
[1966.88 → 1967.86] and the way they will be
[1967.86 → 1968.76] at the end, okay?
[1969.36 → 1970.32] When they put their faith
[1970.32 → 1970.66] in Jesus,
[1970.78 → 1971.24] they learn that
[1971.24 → 1971.90] their relationships,
[1972.10 → 1972.52] their marriages,
[1972.68 → 1973.08] their families
[1973.08 → 1974.08] and their work
[1974.08 → 1975.06] started to take
[1975.06 → 1975.60] a different shape
[1975.60 → 1977.56] and they tasted blessing.
[1978.46 → 1979.88] Jesus came to bring blessing
[1979.88 → 1980.84] in all the places
[1980.84 → 1982.24] that the curse had infected
[1982.24 → 1984.30] and that includes work.
[1985.20 → 1986.32] And I am convicted
[1986.32 → 1987.18] as I've been spending
[1987.18 → 1987.78] this whole week
[1987.78 → 1989.16] reading and studying
[1989.16 → 1990.06] on how the faith
[1990.06 → 1990.76] that we have in Jesus
[1990.76 → 1991.56] shapes our work
[1991.56 → 1993.70] that there must always be
[1993.70 → 1996.08] a profound impact
[1996.08 → 1997.12] of our faith
[1997.12 → 1998.28] into our work.
[1998.90 → 1999.36] I'm going to spend
[1999.36 → 2000.06] the rest of our time
[2000.06 → 2001.24] opening up three dimensions,
[2002.10 → 2003.40] three shifts I might say
[2003.40 → 2004.70] of how our faith in Jesus
[2004.70 → 2005.28] shifts the way
[2005.28 → 2006.20] we do our work, okay?
[2007.32 → 2007.94] Number one,
[2008.90 → 2009.82] to follow Jesus
[2009.82 → 2011.58] and to work
[2011.58 → 2012.54] in the thorns and thistles
[2012.54 → 2013.72] of our vocations,
[2013.86 → 2014.36] occupations
[2014.36 → 2015.00] and all the rest
[2015.00 → 2016.40] is to get a new boss.
[2017.46 → 2018.46] Every time someone
[2018.46 → 2019.08] follows Jesus,
[2020.00 → 2020.96] they get a new boss.
[2021.60 → 2022.38] You ultimately,
[2022.60 → 2023.32] at the end of the day,
[2023.38 → 2024.50] do not work for the person
[2024.50 → 2025.36] who sits in the office
[2025.36 → 2026.12] at the end of the hallway.
[2026.22 → 2026.70] You do not work
[2026.70 → 2027.32] for that principal,
[2027.32 → 2028.54] that person who's on staff.
[2028.90 → 2029.58] Our boss,
[2030.00 → 2030.50] ultimately,
[2030.80 → 2031.50] first and foremost,
[2031.62 → 2032.58] is Jesus Christ.
[2033.00 → 2034.04] And the work we do,
[2034.20 → 2034.58] ultimately,
[2034.82 → 2035.32] first and foremost,
[2035.46 → 2038.08] is for Jesus Christ.
[2038.74 → 2039.60] And I would add,
[2039.62 → 2039.92] and I'll probably
[2039.92 → 2040.54] get back to this,
[2040.78 → 2041.84] that we must do our work
[2041.84 → 2042.44] in such a way
[2042.44 → 2043.08] that we know
[2043.08 → 2043.82] he's watching
[2043.82 → 2045.46] and it honours him
[2045.46 → 2046.38] in the way we do it.
[2047.28 → 2048.20] And I want to read for us
[2048.20 → 2048.86] challenging
[2048.86 → 2050.20] and encouraging words
[2050.20 → 2051.42] that come from Ephesians 6.
[2051.78 → 2052.68] Paul is speaking here
[2052.68 → 2053.30] to slaves,
[2053.36 → 2054.44] which is an important context
[2054.44 → 2055.78] because their work is awful.
[2056.40 → 2057.38] And he writes to them,
[2058.32 → 2059.44] serve wholeheartedly
[2059.44 → 2061.64] as if you were serving the Lord,
[2061.72 → 2062.72] not people.
[2063.32 → 2064.20] Because you know
[2064.20 → 2064.76] that the Lord
[2064.76 → 2066.24] will reward each one of you
[2066.24 → 2067.22] for whatever good they do,
[2067.28 → 2069.50] whether a slave or free.
[2071.22 → 2072.48] Serve wholeheartedly
[2072.48 → 2073.86] as working for the Lord
[2073.86 → 2075.12] and not for people.
[2075.30 → 2076.18] The early Christians
[2076.18 → 2076.84] had to discern,
[2076.96 → 2077.32] what does it mean
[2077.32 → 2078.40] to now work for Jesus
[2078.40 → 2079.46] and understand
[2079.46 → 2081.04] that what I do for him
[2081.04 → 2083.20] trumps what my boss thinks,
[2083.24 → 2084.06] what my coworkers thinks,
[2084.06 → 2085.56] and even what I think.
[2087.56 → 2088.00] Secondly,
[2088.28 → 2088.94] the second shift
[2088.94 → 2089.42] that happens
[2089.42 → 2090.46] when we follow Jesus
[2090.46 → 2092.08] and seek to serve him
[2092.08 → 2093.26] in the midst of our work
[2093.26 → 2094.52] in the thorns and the thistles
[2094.52 → 2096.06] is we get a new purpose.
[2097.42 → 2098.44] You are no longer
[2098.44 → 2099.30] preoccupied
[2099.30 → 2100.68] with self-advancement
[2100.68 → 2101.76] if you are a follower of Jesus.
[2102.70 → 2103.66] You must no longer
[2103.66 → 2104.48] be preoccupied
[2104.48 → 2105.22] with salary
[2105.22 → 2106.52] as a follower of Jesus.
[2106.92 → 2107.76] You must no longer
[2107.76 → 2108.48] be preoccupied
[2108.48 → 2109.26] with the title
[2109.26 → 2110.70] that goes before your name
[2110.70 → 2111.38] on the door
[2111.38 → 2112.64] as a follower of Jesus.
[2112.98 → 2113.82] These things
[2113.82 → 2114.86] are the priorities
[2114.86 → 2115.50] of the world
[2115.50 → 2116.66] and the priority
[2116.66 → 2117.44] of the citizen
[2117.44 → 2118.36] of the kingdom of God
[2118.36 → 2119.34] who seeks to follow Jesus
[2119.34 → 2120.02] is this,
[2120.76 → 2122.68] to bring blessing.
[2124.42 → 2125.32] And by that I mean
[2125.32 → 2125.96] the simple phrase
[2125.96 → 2127.32] that Jesus himself gives is
[2127.32 → 2128.24] you must love
[2128.24 → 2128.96] the Lord your God
[2128.96 → 2129.64] with all your heart
[2129.64 → 2130.24] and your soul,
[2130.34 → 2130.78] your mind,
[2130.82 → 2131.22] and your strength
[2131.22 → 2132.38] and you must love
[2132.38 → 2132.96] your neighbour
[2132.96 → 2133.70] as yourself
[2133.70 → 2134.96] and that includes
[2134.96 → 2136.08] your work.
[2136.98 → 2137.86] And could it be, church,
[2137.94 → 2138.78] that the primary way
[2138.78 → 2139.50] that God is calling you
[2139.50 → 2140.16] to love your neighbour
[2140.16 → 2142.02] is in your work?
[2143.10 → 2143.92] And this is just my,
[2144.04 → 2144.64] actually this is not
[2144.64 → 2145.22] even my insight
[2145.22 → 2146.48] but I agree wholeheartedly
[2146.48 → 2147.14] with Tim Keller
[2147.14 → 2147.86] who says,
[2148.00 → 2149.54] perhaps the first indicator
[2149.54 → 2150.44] of a Christian
[2150.44 → 2151.28] who takes seriously
[2151.28 → 2152.10] the new purpose
[2152.10 → 2152.80] in their work
[2152.80 → 2153.56] is that they do it
[2153.56 → 2154.24] with excellence.
[2155.42 → 2156.30] Imagine the mark
[2156.30 → 2156.76] of a Christian
[2156.76 → 2157.36] in your workplace,
[2157.52 → 2158.00] your industry,
[2158.12 → 2158.68] your job site
[2158.68 → 2159.56] was that the work
[2159.56 → 2160.08] they do
[2160.08 → 2161.62] is excellent work.
[2162.36 → 2163.88] It bears noted
[2163.88 → 2165.12] that you don't have
[2165.12 → 2165.88] to worry about them,
[2165.92 → 2166.50] you don't have to stress
[2166.50 → 2166.82] about them,
[2166.86 → 2167.62] you can trust them
[2167.62 → 2168.58] and what they produce
[2168.58 → 2169.78] is work that is beautiful
[2169.78 → 2170.62] and good
[2170.62 → 2172.86] and worth hearing about,
[2173.24 → 2173.54] seeing,
[2173.88 → 2174.46] and enjoying.
[2176.20 → 2176.44] You know,
[2176.56 → 2177.34] in our church
[2177.34 → 2178.18] I know a number of people
[2178.18 → 2179.26] who do different trades
[2179.26 → 2179.58] than me
[2179.58 → 2180.30] and it's no secret
[2180.30 → 2181.12] that I'm not the most
[2181.12 → 2181.88] handy pastor
[2181.88 → 2184.14] and I require people
[2184.14 → 2184.58] in our church
[2184.58 → 2185.04] who are handy
[2185.04 → 2185.76] to come to our house
[2185.76 → 2186.36] and fix things
[2186.36 → 2187.02] and build things
[2187.02 → 2187.86] and rebuild things
[2187.86 → 2188.38] that we break,
[2188.48 → 2188.76] et cetera.
[2189.50 → 2190.34] And there are a few people
[2190.34 → 2190.76] in our church
[2190.76 → 2191.36] that I'll call
[2191.36 → 2192.64] and I delight in the fact
[2192.64 → 2193.14] that when they come
[2193.14 → 2193.80] to my house
[2193.80 → 2195.56] they work excellently.
[2196.08 → 2196.96] They work with joy,
[2197.12 → 2197.58] with diligence,
[2197.90 → 2198.76] and they do their work
[2198.76 → 2199.50] in a way that I could
[2199.50 → 2199.94] never do
[2199.94 → 2200.88] and I feel them
[2200.88 → 2202.20] loving me as a brother
[2202.20 → 2203.94] as they do that work well.
[2204.50 → 2205.40] And I just delight
[2205.40 → 2205.74] in the fact
[2205.74 → 2206.10] that I know
[2206.10 → 2206.94] they're doing the same thing
[2206.94 → 2207.86] as they go to the job site,
[2207.96 → 2208.74] as they go to the classroom,
[2208.84 → 2210.08] as they go to the hall,
[2210.42 → 2211.24] wherever they are.
[2211.46 → 2212.18] I'm delighted
[2212.18 → 2212.72] by the fact
[2212.72 → 2213.20] that there are people
[2213.20 → 2213.58] in our church
[2213.58 → 2215.36] whose work is excellent
[2215.36 → 2216.84] and that there are Christians
[2216.84 → 2217.30] in this church
[2217.30 → 2218.20] who have a reputation
[2218.20 → 2218.70] in their industry
[2218.70 → 2219.82] because the work they do
[2219.82 → 2221.08] is done well.
[2221.94 → 2224.00] They serve their neighbour well
[2224.00 → 2225.66] through their work.
[2225.66 → 2227.84] That's the way we care.
[2228.16 → 2229.04] That's the way we cultivate.
[2229.20 → 2229.90] That's the way we show
[2229.90 → 2230.72] that we have a new purpose
[2230.72 → 2231.10] in our work.
[2231.18 → 2232.06] It's no longer about money.
[2232.70 → 2233.40] It matters.
[2233.56 → 2234.38] It's no longer about title.
[2234.66 → 2235.56] Sometimes that matters.
[2235.80 → 2236.50] It's no longer about
[2236.50 → 2237.54] what benefits you get.
[2237.62 → 2239.08] It's about how you can serve
[2239.08 → 2240.68] and wash the feet of the world
[2240.68 → 2242.06] through your work.
[2242.82 → 2243.74] And I'm going to ask you,
[2243.74 → 2246.10] is that your vision for work?
[2247.16 → 2248.32] Is that what you think about
[2248.32 → 2248.82] when you get up
[2248.82 → 2249.40] on Monday morning?
[2249.44 → 2250.62] Because my hunch is
[2250.62 → 2251.90] that there's this powerful
[2251.90 → 2252.70] other story
[2252.70 → 2253.38] that we live in
[2253.38 → 2254.28] nine to five every week
[2254.28 → 2255.40] that says work is about
[2255.40 → 2256.00] your salary,
[2256.24 → 2256.96] you get out of it
[2256.96 → 2257.58] what you can,
[2257.80 → 2258.66] you grind it out
[2258.66 → 2259.28] until you retire
[2259.28 → 2260.06] and then you finally
[2260.06 → 2260.70] get to retire
[2260.70 → 2261.82] and enjoy life without work.
[2262.04 → 2263.34] That's not your story.
[2264.50 → 2265.08] That's not what
[2265.08 → 2266.36] the scriptures invite us into.
[2266.72 → 2267.50] Scriptures invite us
[2267.50 → 2268.18] into the posture
[2268.18 → 2268.78] of a servant
[2268.78 → 2270.12] who wants Jesus
[2270.12 → 2270.78] to be honoured
[2270.78 → 2271.74] and our neighbours
[2271.74 → 2272.40] to be blessed
[2272.40 → 2273.46] by the work we do.
[2273.74 → 2276.24] So we get a new boss,
[2276.40 → 2277.24] we get a new purpose
[2277.24 → 2278.04] and finally,
[2278.60 → 2281.10] we work with hope.
[2282.96 → 2284.20] It is true to say
[2284.20 → 2285.56] that the rest of your working years
[2285.56 → 2286.54] will be full of frustration.
[2287.54 → 2289.04] Some of you already now
[2289.04 → 2290.48] are so done
[2290.48 → 2292.02] with your job
[2292.02 → 2292.82] because it's so full
[2292.82 → 2293.40] of frustration,
[2293.68 → 2294.22] there's corruption
[2294.22 → 2295.20] and there's politics,
[2295.34 → 2296.00] there's office stuff,
[2296.08 → 2296.50] all of that.
[2296.70 → 2298.06] You're so ready to not work
[2298.06 → 2299.38] and yet I want to say to you,
[2300.04 → 2301.26] you are called to work
[2301.26 → 2302.12] in that place
[2302.12 → 2303.30] with hope.
[2304.04 → 2305.44] Because what the Christians know
[2305.44 → 2306.10] is that the Jesus
[2306.10 → 2307.20] who undid the power
[2307.20 → 2307.72] of the curse
[2307.72 → 2308.66] in his death and resurrection
[2308.66 → 2309.66] has promised
[2309.66 → 2310.64] that day is coming
[2310.64 → 2312.64] where work will be joyful again.
[2313.44 → 2314.20] We are created
[2314.20 → 2315.10] to work with joy
[2315.10 → 2315.82] and love
[2315.82 → 2316.44] and shalom
[2316.44 → 2317.14] and we will,
[2317.30 → 2317.82] when he returns,
[2317.92 → 2318.88] work with love
[2318.88 → 2319.32] and joy,
[2319.44 → 2320.12] meaning and shalom
[2320.12 → 2321.02] and we work
[2321.02 → 2322.02] with the knowledge
[2322.02 → 2322.90] that that day is coming.
[2324.08 → 2325.08] More than that,
[2325.48 → 2326.56] we work in such a way
[2326.56 → 2327.70] that points other people
[2327.70 → 2328.56] to the way work
[2328.56 → 2329.50] should be
[2329.50 → 2330.90] when Jesus returns.
[2330.90 → 2333.02] I want to read a quote
[2333.02 → 2333.60] for you that we,
[2333.80 → 2334.62] as a surge group,
[2334.70 → 2335.48] we read this week.
[2336.16 → 2336.74] We're talking about
[2336.74 → 2337.68] calling and work
[2337.68 → 2338.76] and Jim Mullins,
[2338.94 → 2340.72] a pastor in Phoenix, Arizona,
[2340.92 → 2341.98] he writes these words,
[2342.10 → 2342.78] and if you're struggling
[2342.78 → 2343.54] in your workplace,
[2344.08 → 2345.12] I want you to be deeply
[2345.12 → 2346.08] encouraged by this,
[2346.30 → 2346.98] to persevere.
[2349.20 → 2350.02] The presence of pain
[2350.02 → 2350.42] and hardship
[2350.42 → 2351.40] is not necessarily
[2351.40 → 2352.02] an indicator
[2352.02 → 2353.08] that you should move on
[2353.08 → 2353.98] to greener pastures
[2353.98 → 2355.54] or for millennials
[2355.54 → 2356.06] and Gen Z,
[2356.30 → 2357.44] don't quit yet.
[2358.52 → 2359.16] Their presence
[2359.16 → 2360.86] might be the very reason
[2360.86 → 2361.72] God planted you
[2361.72 → 2362.34] in that field.
[2362.52 → 2363.12] Did you hear that?
[2363.54 → 2364.56] The presence of difficulty
[2364.56 → 2365.04] and pain
[2365.04 → 2367.16] might be the very reason
[2367.16 → 2368.02] God planted you
[2368.02 → 2368.50] in that field.
[2368.62 → 2370.02] Perhaps he put you there
[2370.02 → 2370.94] to trim some thorns
[2370.94 → 2371.40] and thistles
[2371.40 → 2372.64] as a harbinger
[2372.64 → 2373.78] of the future flourishing
[2373.78 → 2374.72] that he will bring
[2374.72 → 2375.48] to the whole earth.
[2376.46 → 2377.10] And a harbinger,
[2377.18 → 2378.02] if that word is new to you,
[2378.04 → 2379.18] is someone who goes on ahead
[2379.18 → 2380.18] and gives you a picture
[2380.18 → 2380.88] of what's coming.
[2381.32 → 2382.60] So the way Christians do work,
[2382.68 → 2383.56] it's a sneak preview
[2383.56 → 2385.06] for the rest of the world
[2385.06 → 2386.70] for how work is to be done
[2386.70 → 2388.00] when Jesus returns
[2388.00 → 2389.24] and heals his creation
[2389.24 → 2390.02] once and for all.
[2390.72 → 2392.18] How beautiful it would be
[2392.18 → 2393.60] for the framer in our church
[2393.60 → 2394.64] to have people look around
[2394.64 → 2394.82] and say,
[2394.92 → 2395.18] man,
[2395.40 → 2396.38] I wish everyone
[2396.38 → 2397.40] framed houses like that.
[2397.46 → 2398.32] That just gives me a taste
[2398.32 → 2399.44] of how the job should be.
[2399.70 → 2400.34] Or the accountant
[2400.34 → 2401.86] who balances the budgets well,
[2401.96 → 2402.08] it's like,
[2402.26 → 2403.12] that's how it should
[2403.12 → 2403.96] always be done.
[2404.12 → 2405.78] In all these small ways,
[2406.14 → 2407.18] we point to the way
[2407.18 → 2408.18] that work should be done
[2408.18 → 2409.96] and will be done
[2409.96 → 2411.58] when Jesus returns.
[2413.56 → 2414.82] I want to finish
[2414.82 → 2415.46] with a story
[2415.46 → 2416.48] about J.R. Tolkien.
[2417.78 → 2418.52] While writing
[2418.52 → 2419.40] the very famous
[2419.40 → 2420.44] Lord of the Rings trilogy,
[2420.62 → 2421.94] J.R. Tolkien got stuck.
[2422.30 → 2422.84] And we have to give him
[2422.84 → 2423.92] some credit for finishing,
[2424.06 → 2424.64] but he got stuck.
[2424.72 → 2425.40] And in that time,
[2425.70 → 2426.20] he got stuck,
[2426.26 → 2427.22] he wrote a smaller book.
[2427.68 → 2428.60] And that book is called
[2428.60 → 2429.92] Leaf by Niggle.
[2430.04 → 2431.04] Has anyone heard of this book?
[2431.38 → 2432.86] Oh, we got one over there.
[2433.24 → 2433.78] In the first service,
[2433.86 → 2434.60] only one person too.
[2434.66 → 2435.62] So two people at Hope
[2435.62 → 2437.30] know of J.R. Tolkien's book,
[2437.68 → 2438.86] Leaf by Niggle.
[2439.78 → 2440.74] And many people say
[2440.74 → 2442.02] this is a book he wrote
[2442.02 → 2442.96] about himself
[2442.96 → 2443.76] and in some sense,
[2444.30 → 2444.94] to himself.
[2446.18 → 2447.16] The story is about
[2447.16 → 2448.40] a painter named Niggle.
[2449.02 → 2450.98] And he had a very early age,
[2451.16 → 2451.94] he had this vision
[2451.94 → 2453.80] for painting a beautiful tree.
[2454.28 → 2455.10] He had the picture
[2455.10 → 2455.54] of the tree,
[2455.64 → 2456.64] he knew what he wanted to do,
[2456.70 → 2457.44] and he wanted to make it
[2457.44 → 2458.90] his life's work
[2458.90 → 2461.20] to make this grand picture,
[2461.36 → 2462.22] this painting of a tree.
[2463.48 → 2464.38] But he never actually
[2464.38 → 2465.14] got around to it.
[2465.68 → 2465.90] You see,
[2465.96 → 2467.10] Niggle had all sorts of reasons
[2467.10 → 2468.26] why he just never really
[2468.26 → 2469.06] got to the painting.
[2469.62 → 2470.18] Number one,
[2470.92 → 2472.16] Niggle was a procrastinator.
[2472.64 → 2473.48] Anyone can relate to this?
[2473.76 → 2475.16] He always seemed to prioritize
[2475.16 → 2475.98] the other jobs
[2475.98 → 2476.84] that were right in front of him
[2476.84 → 2477.76] and never made the time.
[2477.88 → 2478.36] Number two,
[2479.08 → 2480.02] Niggle was a neighbour
[2480.02 → 2481.28] and he really enjoyed
[2481.28 → 2481.94] getting involved
[2481.94 → 2483.10] in the lives of his neighbours,
[2483.26 → 2484.22] helping out where he could,
[2484.40 → 2485.10] loved his family,
[2485.18 → 2486.54] and he always just gave time
[2486.54 → 2487.40] to other things,
[2487.74 → 2488.84] never prioritizing
[2488.84 → 2489.48] this piece of art.
[2489.56 → 2490.14] But number three,
[2490.62 → 2491.24] and maybe you can relate
[2491.24 → 2491.90] to this as well,
[2492.82 → 2493.66] Niggle is described
[2493.66 → 2494.72] as a perfectionist.
[2495.28 → 2496.24] When he did get to
[2496.24 → 2497.00] his piece of art,
[2497.00 → 2498.42] he was so preoccupied
[2498.42 → 2499.16] with the veins
[2499.16 → 2500.62] on one particular leaf
[2500.62 → 2501.38] that he would just focus
[2501.38 → 2502.60] so intimately
[2502.60 → 2503.34] on that one detail,
[2503.42 → 2504.10] he'd never finish
[2504.10 → 2504.96] the rest of the tree.
[2506.26 → 2507.18] And as the book continues,
[2507.32 → 2508.00] Niggle gets to the end
[2508.00 → 2508.52] of his life
[2508.52 → 2509.26] and he's weeping
[2509.26 → 2511.26] because at the end,
[2511.54 → 2514.00] only one leaf was finished
[2514.00 → 2515.20] and then he died.
[2517.70 → 2518.38] But that's not
[2518.38 → 2519.20] where the story ends.
[2520.04 → 2521.04] The story ends,
[2521.22 → 2522.14] as Tolkien puts it,
[2522.58 → 2523.44] Niggle is brought
[2523.44 → 2524.82] to the heavenly country
[2524.82 → 2525.96] and he's brought
[2525.96 → 2526.66] to the outskirts
[2526.66 → 2527.28] of this country
[2527.28 → 2528.12] and something catches
[2528.12 → 2528.98] his eye that he starts
[2528.98 → 2529.60] moving towards
[2529.60 → 2530.68] and eventually running towards
[2530.68 → 2531.88] and he finally gets there
[2531.88 → 2532.82] and what he beholds
[2532.82 → 2534.54] is the tree
[2534.54 → 2536.98] and all of its beauty
[2536.98 → 2537.76] and grandeur.
[2537.88 → 2538.76] And when Niggle sees
[2538.76 → 2539.16] the tree,
[2539.24 → 2540.44] he spent his whole life
[2540.44 → 2541.40] trying to draw
[2541.40 → 2542.44] in this beautiful piece
[2542.44 → 2542.70] of art.
[2542.98 → 2544.06] He lifts his arms
[2544.06 → 2544.74] and he says,
[2544.74 → 2546.98] it's a gift.
[2548.94 → 2550.06] So why does Tolkien
[2550.06 → 2550.86] write that story?
[2552.46 → 2553.62] Many agree that it's
[2553.62 → 2554.58] Tolkien's way of saying
[2554.58 → 2555.32] to everyone
[2555.32 → 2556.58] and to himself
[2556.58 → 2558.06] that the work we do
[2558.06 → 2558.54] in this world
[2558.54 → 2559.00] is going to be
[2559.00 → 2559.94] so frustrating.
[2560.78 → 2561.54] Some of the work we do
[2561.54 → 2562.58] will never get finished.
[2562.68 → 2563.00] Some of the things
[2563.00 → 2563.88] we want to do the most
[2563.88 → 2565.32] will never even get started
[2565.32 → 2566.44] and we will die
[2566.44 → 2567.44] with so many things
[2567.44 → 2568.20] we wish we had
[2568.20 → 2568.90] gotten around to.
[2570.10 → 2572.08] But the God
[2572.08 → 2573.44] who created us to work,
[2573.44 → 2574.80] the God who gave us
[2574.80 → 2575.84] the gifts to paint,
[2575.98 → 2577.04] create, design,
[2577.18 → 2578.20] construct and all the rest,
[2578.48 → 2579.08] he is the one
[2579.08 → 2580.30] who not only takes
[2580.30 → 2580.92] the good work
[2580.92 → 2581.80] that's done in this world
[2581.80 → 2583.26] into the new creation,
[2583.84 → 2584.88] preserves the good work.
[2585.00 → 2585.78] There will be Beethoven
[2585.78 → 2587.26] in the new creation
[2587.26 → 2587.90] in my opinion.
[2588.64 → 2590.38] But he also gives us
[2590.38 → 2591.12] good work to do
[2591.12 → 2592.80] with joy and love,
[2593.12 → 2595.34] delight in the world to come.
[2596.32 → 2597.64] There will be a tree
[2597.64 → 2599.64] for all of us.
[2599.98 → 2600.88] There will be good work
[2600.88 → 2601.48] for you to do
[2601.48 → 2601.90] with the gifts
[2601.90 → 2602.70] that God has given
[2602.70 → 2603.84] specifically to you
[2603.84 → 2605.68] that you will delight in
[2605.68 → 2607.64] for eternity
[2607.64 → 2610.38] because Jesus has sealed
[2610.38 → 2611.00] that future
[2611.00 → 2612.44] by his resurrection.
[2613.70 → 2615.58] And that gives us hope
[2615.58 → 2617.52] to grind through
[2617.52 → 2618.98] the thorns and the thistles
[2618.98 → 2620.82] today, tomorrow
[2620.82 → 2622.40] and for the rest of your life
[2622.40 → 2623.30] because you know
[2623.30 → 2624.16] where the future is going.
[2625.02 → 2625.76] And so we hear again
[2625.76 → 2626.46] the words of Jesus
[2626.46 → 2627.42] in John 16.
[2628.06 → 2629.02] In this world,
[2629.86 → 2630.80] in your work,
[2630.80 → 2632.34] you will have trouble.
[2633.24 → 2634.32] But take heart, church.
[2635.04 → 2636.44] I have overcome the world.
[2637.58 → 2638.20] Let's pray.
[2643.00 → 2643.88] Father, we begin
[2643.88 → 2644.64] by thanking you
[2644.64 → 2645.36] for our work.
[2646.74 → 2647.48] We thank you
[2647.48 → 2648.10] that even though
[2648.10 → 2649.14] it is very hard
[2649.14 → 2650.72] that you provide us
[2650.72 → 2651.32] with employment,
[2652.20 → 2652.88] gifts to use
[2652.88 → 2653.80] to serve others.
[2654.30 → 2655.24] And I pray, Lord,
[2655.30 → 2656.02] that you're blessing
[2656.02 → 2657.92] would rest on every one of us
[2657.92 → 2658.56] tomorrow morning
[2658.56 → 2659.38] as we wake up
[2659.38 → 2660.60] and we go to jobs
[2660.60 → 2661.30] that aren't easy,
[2661.92 → 2662.84] that aren't fun,
[2663.10 → 2664.10] that don't feel meaningful,
[2664.38 → 2664.98] that are caught up
[2664.98 → 2666.16] in all sorts of frustrations
[2666.16 → 2666.80] in politics.
[2666.92 → 2667.66] We pray, Lord,
[2667.80 → 2668.70] that you would give us
[2668.70 → 2669.36] the strength,
[2670.18 → 2670.86] the perseverance,
[2671.54 → 2672.46] and the wisdom
[2672.46 → 2674.30] to be blessings
[2674.30 → 2675.62] in all those places.
[2676.88 → 2678.22] We pray that you would be
[2678.22 → 2679.60] so generous to us
[2679.60 → 2680.86] as to use us
[2680.86 → 2681.72] to love our neighbours
[2681.72 → 2683.64] and make the goodness
[2683.64 → 2684.54] of Jesus known
[2684.54 → 2685.84] through our work.
[2685.84 → 2687.42] And to that end,
[2687.46 → 2687.98] would you fill us
[2687.98 → 2688.62] with courage,
[2689.82 → 2690.28] perseverance,
[2691.42 → 2692.02] love,
[2693.00 → 2693.58] patience,
[2693.92 → 2694.90] and all the fruits
[2694.90 → 2695.62] of your spirit
[2695.62 → 2696.26] that enable us
[2696.26 → 2697.28] to do work well
[2697.28 → 2698.18] in the thorns
[2698.18 → 2698.90] and the thistles.
[2700.14 → 2701.24] Give us hope, Lord,
[2701.30 → 2702.28] that the day is coming
[2702.28 → 2703.82] where we will do work
[2703.82 → 2704.62] in delight.
[2705.74 → 2706.66] Come, Lord Jesus,
[2707.72 → 2708.56] heal your world.
[2709.36 → 2709.58] Amen.
