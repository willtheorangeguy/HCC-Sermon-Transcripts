[0.00 --> 18.08]  We are on a Sunday between series.
[18.84 --> 23.52]  So it was kind of one of those open moments that we just finished off a series.
[23.52 --> 26.88]  We'll start another one soon again on the Beatitudes.
[27.38 --> 29.62]  But in the meantime, this was kind of an open moment.
[30.28 --> 32.86]  So I was kind of thinking, gee, what am I going to preach on?
[32.94 --> 35.14]  Because sometimes I know well in advance what it is.
[37.06 --> 42.22]  Last week I really enjoyed Pastor Dave's sermon on the church being a global community.
[43.34 --> 44.92]  This idea of how we need each other.
[45.12 --> 47.46]  And we need each other to see well and understand well.
[48.42 --> 51.82]  All the body parts that Paul writes about, all the body parts are needed.
[52.90 --> 59.04]  And in Dave's sermon, he spoke on the influence of culture and how we have blind spots to seeing,
[59.04 --> 62.26]  how we're shaped by the culture around us.
[62.64 --> 63.12]  All of us.
[64.28 --> 71.00]  And he referred to that metaphor that he nailed down very specifically as either African or Asian.
[71.84 --> 73.64]  And it happened to be neither one of them.
[74.22 --> 77.84]  But anyway, he spoke about the fish swimming in water.
[78.10 --> 79.70]  Maybe those of you who were here remember that.
[80.10 --> 82.44]  And some of you, if you weren't, you remember that metaphor.
[82.44 --> 84.34]  And it really goes like this.
[84.40 --> 86.28]  The fish is asked by someone.
[86.40 --> 88.48]  He says, how's the water?
[89.34 --> 92.34]  To which the fish replies, what's water?
[93.72 --> 95.14]  Because he's in it all the time.
[95.22 --> 96.18]  He knows nothing else.
[96.42 --> 98.86]  There's no word for water for him.
[98.98 --> 99.74]  He lives in it.
[99.74 --> 104.16]  And that's us.
[104.18 --> 106.70]  That's us swimming in the cultural waters.
[106.90 --> 114.00]  And as Dave said, we need to help one another, especially those of other cultures looking at Western culture,
[114.00 --> 122.04]  to help us see clearly what is shaping us or maybe even misshaping us.
[122.04 --> 124.62]  Dave said, and I quote,
[124.86 --> 128.90]  the power of the cross reconciles people who were once enemies,
[129.58 --> 132.06]  who were once defined by cultural identities,
[132.28 --> 136.12]  and in his day, slaves and free, female,
[136.58 --> 139.12]  these identity pieces here,
[139.12 --> 142.84]  he says, who now see each other as brothers and sisters.
[143.52 --> 147.76]  And we change the whole story as sons and daughters of the King of Kings.
[147.76 --> 154.16]  And I long for us to live that out more and more and more.
[155.08 --> 158.84]  But I think sometimes understanding how we are shaped culturally
[158.84 --> 163.58]  might help us see how we're kind of getting in the way at times.
[164.72 --> 168.82]  I was reading something about Western culture,
[169.18 --> 171.76]  and they talked about radical individualism
[171.76 --> 177.04]  and how that has been sort of the cultural lie or blind spot
[177.04 --> 181.14]  that has been absorbed by America in particular,
[181.26 --> 182.26]  but Canada as well,
[182.66 --> 184.36]  absorbed for a long, long time.
[184.60 --> 185.94]  I was reading about this author,
[186.08 --> 189.60]  and this author wrote during the time of 1831.
[190.26 --> 191.54]  So this is a long time ago.
[191.84 --> 193.80]  And he was touring America, and he wrote this,
[194.36 --> 197.84]  extremist individualism has redefined America,
[198.18 --> 200.00]  and if left unchecked,
[200.00 --> 202.98]  it would spell the abolition of humanity.
[202.98 --> 212.88]  Somehow, this lie of radical individualism harms us.
[215.54 --> 217.42]  But we don't see it necessarily.
[218.42 --> 220.08]  And that worries me.
[220.40 --> 222.88]  You know, that was 1830.
[223.64 --> 224.78]  There was other story,
[224.86 --> 228.12]  Ben Franklin talking about the same kind of thing.
[228.12 --> 229.74]  Way back then, you know,
[230.02 --> 232.86]  already that was shaping the culture,
[233.44 --> 235.50]  this self-sufficient human being,
[235.86 --> 237.76]  this my ideas, my thoughts,
[237.90 --> 239.74]  me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[242.18 --> 244.68]  There's some studies done that looked at church attendance,
[245.60 --> 249.00]  and it's half of what it was in the 1950s.
[250.42 --> 253.42]  And you say, well, maybe in part due to secularism.
[253.48 --> 254.66]  That's probably true to a degree.
[255.06 --> 256.54]  But I think it's more than that.
[256.54 --> 261.40]  We swim in that individualism of Western cultural waters.
[261.90 --> 263.82]  And then we say things like,
[263.94 --> 267.00]  well, that's your truth,
[267.44 --> 270.06]  which is a silly thing to say.
[271.40 --> 274.32]  I'm not saying we don't have our own understandings,
[274.80 --> 276.58]  but truth is truth is truth.
[276.78 --> 279.34]  And we might be struggling to find it together,
[279.86 --> 283.00]  but this idea that truth is something bigger than us is important,
[283.00 --> 285.88]  and we lose that in this radical individualism.
[286.54 --> 290.70]  And we talk about truth and humility,
[290.76 --> 292.72]  and I irrelevant to this.
[295.24 --> 297.98]  I'm not saying we have observant any scoring thing on this document,
[298.02 --> 299.06]  but we don't have to trust them that we are all in the内内,
[306.60 --> 307.36]  but we see what it means to us.
[307.36 --> 311.14]  Thus the term bowling alone.
[311.14 --> 312.74]  We don't join a league.
[312.74 --> 318.04]  I remember my parents joining bowling league when I was a kid back in Edmonton, right?
[318.04 --> 319.48]  You know, bowling.
[319.48 --> 326.02]  You did things for socialness, but now it's bowling alone.
[326.02 --> 330.64]  And this individualism has all kinds of problems.
[330.64 --> 337.78]  One is that it has led to isolation and loneliness, which ironically has led to stronger levels
[337.78 --> 339.66]  of tribalism.
[339.66 --> 341.74]  We hear that word quite a bit lately.
[341.74 --> 345.88]  Journalist David Brooks calls tribalism the dark twin of community.
[345.88 --> 348.96]  There's a big difference between the two.
[348.96 --> 352.80]  Community is based on mutual love.
[352.80 --> 355.54]  Tribalism on hate and fear.
[355.54 --> 357.96]  Community is about who we are for.
[357.96 --> 367.60]  And you have these lonely people who don't connect to community, who are told their opinions
[367.60 --> 373.40]  are the truth all the time, and whatever you think is right because you think it.
[373.40 --> 380.44]  All of these things, that leads to the tribalism versus the community where we struggle together
[380.44 --> 382.80]  to try to think things through.
[382.80 --> 389.16]  Based on truth that's bigger than just an opinion.
[389.16 --> 390.44]  And here's the question.
[390.44 --> 391.44]  Why are you doing this?
[391.44 --> 396.44]  Do we see what's happening to us?
[396.44 --> 403.44]  And I might ask, are you building up tribes or are you building up communities in the way
[403.44 --> 406.44]  you live?
[406.44 --> 410.08]  I'm building up communities in the lobby market?
[410.08 --> 415.92]  And I know when you're building up communities here, like this is the whole thing you need
[415.92 --> 418.48]  to do with COVID to perceptible as a vortex sort ofviamente, no school, it means it makes
[418.48 --> 421.70]  a wave of 25% and nobiative chemist yet.
[421.70 --> 425.08]  So that doesn't 42% of our ее belief.
[425.08 --> 436.20]  Why are you stepping back towards
[436.20 --> 442.66]  radical individual. How do we as Christ followers deal with all of that? And I
[442.66 --> 447.66]  think that is we are trying to stay aware of how we're shaped or misshaped by the
[447.66 --> 452.56]  culture around us. And I think the older I get the more challenging it can be. I
[452.56 --> 456.72]  might feel insecure with change too and I might push against it in ways that
[456.72 --> 460.74]  aren't healthy. And I sometimes think younger generations often think they are
[460.74 --> 465.72]  more enlightened, they see clearer than those of the past. And maybe that's true
[465.72 --> 470.50]  sometimes. But how aware are you young people just like old people? How are you
[470.50 --> 480.14]  aware of the cultural waters you swim in and how it's shaping you? How should you
[480.14 --> 488.34]  think that through and live that out? Maybe you feel insecure with all that stuff
[488.34 --> 495.46]  going on. Look at Hebrews 13 verse 7 through 9 with me. It says,
[495.46 --> 502.30]  remember your leaders. I like that start because we acknowledge that
[502.30 --> 505.84]  there's people who are in leadership positions and we remember them who
[505.84 --> 509.14]  spoke and what are they supposed to be doing? Who spoke the Word of God to you.
[509.14 --> 514.54]  All right, that's good. Consider the outcome of their way of life. Okay, we're gonna look at
[514.54 --> 521.66]  their life too. And imitate their faith. Jesus Christ, here's the key, Jesus Christ is
[521.66 --> 526.60]  the same yesterday, today and forever. Do not be carried away by all kinds of
[526.60 --> 530.54]  strange teachings, right? Stuff that's coming up, change that's coming. It's good
[530.54 --> 535.98]  for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by eating ceremonial foods. And that was
[535.98 --> 542.58]  the big issue of their day, which is of no benefit to those who do so. The solid
[542.58 --> 546.66]  ground with all the change and all the dynamics going around, that solid foundation,
[546.66 --> 552.16]  that security is Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today and tomorrow. That's the
[552.16 --> 557.18]  true north we navigate the inevitable changes that we come into. He is our
[557.18 --> 564.12]  constant, continually faithful in our lives and our families, in our churches. We build
[564.12 --> 569.54]  our lives on Him and His truth. We build our lives on His life, His death and His
[569.54 --> 575.60]  resurrection. And we might wonder how to answer all the questions that come our way.
[575.60 --> 581.10]  Where are we? Where are we going? Who am I? And we remind ourselves, He is the same today,
[581.10 --> 590.98]  yesterday and tomorrow. He keeps us balanced. He keeps us secure. And so as parents, as
[590.98 --> 598.60]  grandparents, as friends, as co-workers and leaders, I see our main task as involving one
[598.60 --> 607.60]  of these. Any of you ever handed one of these off? Yeah, some of you. I think I might have
[607.60 --> 612.60]  even taught a couple of you how to pass a baton. I see one nodding there. I remember those days.
[612.60 --> 618.60]  Right? The baton. This is the... I'm going to use this as a metaphor for the main thing,
[618.60 --> 623.60]  the most important thing. I used to coach some elementary school track and field when I was a teacher.
[623.60 --> 634.60]  I always loved the 4x100 meter relay. You know, it's one lap, four runners. And the baton pass was critical. In fact,
[634.60 --> 652.60]  races are won and lost by doing a good baton pass. And you want your 4x1 team to run like one uninterrupted runner. And so the baton pass becomes really, really important. You know, where you...
[652.60 --> 661.60]  So you always... Because in a 4x4, it's four runners each running a lap each. The timing of the baton pass is not as big a deal. But 4x1 is a huge deal.
[661.60 --> 669.60]  You always taught these kids, okay, you know, your arm's back, you're looking forward, and you're going to hear your name when the person's coming behind you.
[669.60 --> 678.60]  They yell your name and you go shoot out as fast as you can go. Run as hard as you can. Keep that arm back. And then, hopefully, the baton is in there.
[678.60 --> 688.60]  And it's almost like we never slowed down at all. In fact, maybe we gained speed. I remember at one meet we were at, you know, because it's tricky, you know,
[688.60 --> 700.60]  and sometimes the baton pass isn't very good. And one kid, he was running, finally the pass went, finally he was running, and he banged it on his knee, and he dropped the baton, and he just picked it up and whipped it out there to the next runner here.
[700.60 --> 718.60]  And that's not legal. So, it didn't work. You have to have the baton in hand from runner to runner in order for the race to count. The race is really a waste without this.
[718.60 --> 725.60]  Look at Paul using running imagery in 2 Timothy 4, where he writes, and notice when he's writing,
[725.60 --> 733.60]  And the time for my departure is near. The time of his death is near. Then he writes,
[733.60 --> 740.60]  I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith, and indeed passed it on.
[740.60 --> 747.60]  Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day.
[747.60 --> 751.60]  And not only to me, but also to all who longed for his appearing.
[751.60 --> 758.60]  The baton is our faith in Jesus Christ, who is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
[758.60 --> 763.60]  And I run my race with all my heart and all my strength, looking ahead to the next runner.
[763.60 --> 770.60]  Who do I see ahead of me? I see my kids up there. I hopefully see the hand back. I see my grandchildren up there.
[770.60 --> 777.60]  Hopefully the hand is back, waiting to take the baton. I see Dave Groon in front of me, other leaders in the church in front of me.
[777.60 --> 784.60]  I see all of you in front of me. I want your hands back, so the baton comes into your hand, and you pass it on then to the next generation.
[784.60 --> 787.60]  And the next, and the next, and the next.
[787.60 --> 803.60]  I pray you're ready to run. I pray your hand is ready to go back and take hold of the baton, eyes forward on the prize.
[803.60 --> 807.60]  And I might ask you, because I think it's an important question that we need to ask ourselves.
[807.60 --> 814.60]  What am I handing off? My opinions? No.
[814.60 --> 817.60]  My money? No.
[817.60 --> 821.60]  My brilliance? No.
[821.60 --> 825.60]  The baton. Jesus Christ, the one who's the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
[825.60 --> 828.60]  That's what we are passing on.
[828.60 --> 832.60]  We've got so many good things that we can share with the next generation, right?
[832.60 --> 838.60]  Fun things, sports and skills and hobbies, camping trips, great stories, our attitudes, all kinds of good things.
[838.60 --> 840.60]  Our legacy stuff that we pass on.
[840.60 --> 842.60]  But those are not the baton.
[842.60 --> 855.60]  You will have failed if all you passed on was your inheritance.
[855.60 --> 861.60]  I want the next runners to run their race well, and to run with meaning and purpose.
[861.60 --> 864.60]  To run with the baton, the true baton, the one baton.
[864.60 --> 866.60]  Because that's worth living for.
[866.60 --> 869.60]  Parents, as I said, you have so many good things to pass on.
[869.60 --> 871.60]  Do that with joy and intentionality, right?
[871.60 --> 873.60]  You can share all kinds of wonderful things.
[873.60 --> 876.60]  But please don't forget the main task.
[876.60 --> 879.60]  Passing on your baton to the next generation.
[879.60 --> 882.60]  We are part of a long history of baton passing.
[882.60 --> 884.60]  Look at Hebrews 12, 1 and 2.
[884.60 --> 886.60]  Where he writes,
[886.60 --> 892.60]  Therefore, since we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses, all those who love the baton,
[892.60 --> 896.60]  a great cloud of witnesses, those in the past, those in the present, those yet to come, all the great cloud.
[896.60 --> 900.60]  And let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles.
[900.60 --> 902.60]  We can get tripped up in all kinds of ways.
[902.60 --> 903.60]  And let us run.
[903.60 --> 904.60]  Here we are in the race again.
[904.60 --> 911.60]  Let us run with perseverance, the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus.
[913.60 --> 916.60]  We have a great cloud of witnesses.
[916.60 --> 920.60]  It's so easy to get distracted by all kinds of things around us.
[920.60 --> 923.60]  And then we maybe are going to pass on all kinds of things.
[923.60 --> 926.60]  You know, money, opinions, politics, entertainment, whatever, whatever.
[926.60 --> 931.60]  And I would call those baton substitutes, but they're not batons.
[931.60 --> 935.60]  And we might even call them the good life, but it's not enough.
[936.60 --> 941.60]  The baton is the gospel story that needs to inform how we live our lives.
[941.60 --> 944.60]  It is where true life is found.
[944.60 --> 951.60]  Let me remind you, you will not pass on what isn't central to your life.
[953.60 --> 956.60]  Well, you, I should probably say it another way, you will pass on what's central to your life.
[957.60 --> 962.60]  And if the gospel and Jesus Christ aren't central to your life, then you are likely aren't going to pass that on.
[962.60 --> 965.60]  You're going to pass on something else, but it won't be a baton.
[966.60 --> 971.60]  Let me ask you this.
[972.60 --> 978.60]  What are your kids or your grandkids or your friends, what have they seen as central to your life?
[979.60 --> 983.60]  Oh, he's got a lot of opinions. Wonderful.
[983.60 --> 986.60]  He argues vehemently already. All kinds of things.
[987.60 --> 989.60]  Oh, he's done really well in business. Great.
[990.60 --> 994.60]  All those things are fine or not fine in some ways too.
[995.60 --> 997.60]  But what would they say you are passing on?
[998.60 --> 1001.60]  What baton are you handing off to the next generation?
[1002.60 --> 1004.60]  To your neighbors, to your coworkers?
[1005.60 --> 1007.60]  Look at Psalm 78.
[1007.60 --> 1009.60]  To your neighbors, to your coworkers.
[1010.60 --> 1012.60]  Look at Psalm 78.
[1015.60 --> 1016.60]  Think back. Psalm 78.
[1017.60 --> 1019.60]  So this is the time of David and so forth.
[1020.60 --> 1021.60]  Long, long, long, long time ago.
[1022.60 --> 1024.60]  Notice, you know, they swam in their cultural waters too.
[1025.60 --> 1028.60]  But notice how they describe baton passing in this passage.
[1029.60 --> 1030.60]  My people, hear my teaching.
[1031.60 --> 1032.60]  Listen to the words of my mouth.
[1033.60 --> 1034.60]  I will open my mouth with a parable.
[1034.60 --> 1036.60]  I will utter hidden things, things from of old, right, from the past.
[1036.60 --> 1038.60]  Things we have heard and know.
[1038.60 --> 1040.60]  Things our ancestors have told us.
[1041.60 --> 1043.60]  We will not hide them from their descendants.
[1044.60 --> 1046.60]  We will tell the next generation what?
[1047.60 --> 1049.60]  The praiseworthy deeds of the Lord.
[1050.60 --> 1053.60]  His power and the wonders he has done.
[1054.60 --> 1057.60]  He decreed statutes, laws for Jacob.
[1058.60 --> 1060.60]  He established the law in Israel, ways of living.
[1061.60 --> 1063.60]  Which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children.
[1063.60 --> 1065.60]  So the next generation would know them.
[1066.60 --> 1071.60]  And even the children yet to be born, they in turn would tell their children.
[1072.60 --> 1078.60]  And they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.
[1079.60 --> 1080.60]  They would live in the way of the Lord.
[1081.60 --> 1082.60]  And they would pass that on to the next generation.
[1082.60 --> 1083.60]  From generation to generation.
[1083.60 --> 1084.60]  From generation to generation.
[1084.60 --> 1085.60]  Those yet unborn.
[1085.60 --> 1088.60]  You see how the psalmist is thinking way ahead.
[1088.60 --> 1090.60]  We are passing the baton again and again.
[1091.60 --> 1098.60]  The older I get, the more I don't want to miss out on passing the baton in my life.
[1099.60 --> 1102.60]  And notice how the psalmist looks back to those who have gone before.
[1102.60 --> 1105.60]  That great cloud of witnesses cheering us on.
[1105.60 --> 1110.60]  It is so easy in our individualistic culture to neglect those who ran before us.
[1111.60 --> 1112.60]  Right?
[1112.60 --> 1115.60]  We might say, well, those people in the past, they weren't as enlightened as we are now.
[1116.60 --> 1118.60]  They didn't have it all straight.
[1119.60 --> 1120.60]  They thought this.
[1120.60 --> 1121.60]  Can you believe it?
[1121.60 --> 1123.60]  And maybe in some ways that can be true sometimes.
[1123.60 --> 1124.60]  I am not saying there isn't sometimes progress.
[1124.60 --> 1128.60]  But in the main task, the one passing the baton to the next generation.
[1129.60 --> 1131.60]  We celebrate that because that's the main task.
[1138.60 --> 1139.60]  So run your race.
[1141.60 --> 1142.60]  And pass the baton.
[1144.60 --> 1145.60]  And then we also look forward.
[1146.60 --> 1147.60]  As I said, we always told the kids to run.
[1147.60 --> 1148.60]  Look forward.
[1148.60 --> 1149.60]  Look straight ahead.
[1149.60 --> 1150.60]  Wait for your name to call.
[1150.60 --> 1151.60]  Shove your hand back.
[1151.60 --> 1152.60]  Get ready to run.
[1152.60 --> 1153.60]  Look.
[1153.60 --> 1154.60]  Look.
[1154.60 --> 1155.60]  He's looking for.
[1155.60 --> 1156.60]  Look at Philippians 3.
[1156.60 --> 1159.60]  But one thing I do, Paul writes, forgetting what is behind.
[1159.60 --> 1160.60]  Right?
[1160.60 --> 1161.60]  I'm not going to get distracted.
[1161.60 --> 1162.60]  And straining toward what is ahead.
[1162.60 --> 1168.60]  I press on toward the goal to win the prize which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
[1169.60 --> 1171.60]  He clearly is holding the baton.
[1172.60 --> 1174.60]  And he's seeing the next runners.
[1175.60 --> 1176.60]  And we share this.
[1176.60 --> 1177.60]  We share this now.
[1177.60 --> 1179.60]  We share what we have received.
[1179.60 --> 1184.60]  So that, as the psalmist said, so that they may trust you, Lord, with their races.
[1188.60 --> 1190.60]  I know a lot of you do this, but I do it every day.
[1190.60 --> 1191.60]  My wife and I both.
[1191.60 --> 1195.60]  I pray deeply, deeply each day for my children and my grandchildren.
[1196.60 --> 1197.60]  Deeply.
[1198.60 --> 1199.60]  Every day.
[1199.60 --> 1200.60]  Several times a day.
[1201.60 --> 1204.60]  And I pray, Lord, might they trust you.
[1204.60 --> 1210.60]  I want you to know, and it's true, this is not hyperbole.
[1210.60 --> 1214.60]  I pray each and every day for all of you.
[1215.60 --> 1218.60]  And I pray, might they trust you.
[1221.60 --> 1223.60]  Might they trust you.
[1223.60 --> 1224.60]  Because nothing else matters.
[1226.60 --> 1227.60]  Because nothing else matters.
[1231.60 --> 1232.60]  That's why we have small groups in the church.
[1232.60 --> 1234.60]  Because we want people to encourage each other.
[1234.60 --> 1236.60]  That's why we have Cornerstone, because we want our kids to get this.
[1236.60 --> 1239.60]  And Tot Romp, and Storytime, because we want our community to get this.
[1239.60 --> 1241.60]  And Youth Nights, because we want our teens to get this.
[1242.60 --> 1244.60]  And Young Adult Events, because we want our young adults to get this.
[1244.60 --> 1246.60]  That's why we gather together weekly.
[1246.60 --> 1250.60]  Every week we say to one another, this is the baton, remember.
[1250.60 --> 1252.60]  Don't get sucked into anything else.
[1252.60 --> 1253.60]  This is it.
[1254.60 --> 1256.60]  This is what we pass on.
[1256.60 --> 1257.60]  Oh, there's so many issues.
[1257.60 --> 1259.60]  This is what we pass on.
[1259.60 --> 1262.60]  So let's run together.
[1262.60 --> 1264.60]  Sometimes it's hard.
[1264.60 --> 1274.60]  Let's help each other run well.
[1274.60 --> 1277.60]  And when we make a mess of it, let's say sorry.
[1278.60 --> 1281.60]  Let's help each other know the baton.
[1281.60 --> 1285.60]  Let's not just shoot our mouths off with a million opinions.
[1286.60 --> 1288.60]  Let's challenge each other to take up a baton.
[1288.60 --> 1291.60]  And when we think someone is pulling up a baton,
[1291.60 --> 1294.60]  that isn't the real deal, let's talk about that and say,
[1294.60 --> 1295.60]  hey, hey, hey, that's not it.
[1295.60 --> 1296.60]  That's not it.
[1296.60 --> 1299.60]  Get the true baton and pass that on.
[1300.60 --> 1302.60]  That's the main task.
[1303.60 --> 1306.60]  And I think of a quote that when Dave talked about how we get informed
[1306.60 --> 1310.60]  in Western culture by some of our, some folks in our churches
[1310.60 --> 1312.60]  from other cultures, he talked about someone from Ghana.
[1312.60 --> 1313.60]  And here's a quote.
[1313.60 --> 1315.60]  Your opinions, your emotions, and your feelings do not trump
[1315.60 --> 1317.60]  what Jesus Christ says in His Word.
[1317.60 --> 1319.60]  And he says, you know, you know, you know, you know,
[1319.60 --> 1321.60]  you know, it does not trump what Jesus Christ says in his Word.
[1322.60 --> 1326.60]  Very clearly saying, the baton is the baton is the baton.
[1327.60 --> 1329.60]  No matter how you spin it.
[1330.60 --> 1335.60]  Lots of things change.
[1336.60 --> 1337.60]  Lots of things will change.
[1338.60 --> 1340.60]  Circumstances change.
[1340.60 --> 1342.60]  Our bodies change.
[1342.60 --> 1343.60]  Maybe you notice.
[1344.60 --> 1346.60]  Ideas change.
[1346.60 --> 1348.28]  But God doesn't change.
[1348.28 --> 1349.88]  The gospel doesn't change.
[1349.88 --> 1354.38]  It's the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
[1354.38 --> 1359.88]  And sometimes there's huge moments of change where we as churches and denominations and
[1359.88 --> 1361.56]  so forth go through things together.
[1361.56 --> 1365.94]  Think of the Reformation, a huge moment in history where things, you know, big challenging
[1365.94 --> 1366.94]  things happened.
[1366.94 --> 1372.00]  Wars were fought all about change and battles were fought and the Word of God became given
[1372.00 --> 1373.00]  to everybody.
[1373.00 --> 1375.82]  All kinds of amazing things and horrible things and tough things happened.
[1375.82 --> 1378.14]  But it was all part of finding out.
[1378.14 --> 1380.62]  Sometimes, you know, again, we forgot what the baton was.
[1380.62 --> 1383.28]  We need to remind ourselves again and again and again.
[1383.28 --> 1386.06]  This is what we pass on.
[1386.06 --> 1388.56]  Sometimes it takes a Reformation.
[1388.56 --> 1392.12]  And sometimes it's just hard moments in life and sometimes they're challenging, difficult
[1392.12 --> 1393.12]  moments.
[1393.12 --> 1395.12]  But God remains faithful in it all.
[1395.12 --> 1397.12]  In it all.
[1397.12 --> 1400.12]  We sang about that today.
[1400.12 --> 1402.12]  I was reading something out of Deuteronomy.
[1402.12 --> 1403.48]  I'm going to read it with you.
[1403.48 --> 1405.80]  But I took it out of the voice and I like that it's Deuteronomy and others.
[1405.80 --> 1410.10]  I like that we're talking about like time of Moses times.
[1410.10 --> 1411.70]  Way back.
[1411.70 --> 1412.70]  Way back.
[1412.70 --> 1417.70]  And this is a parent basically talking to a kid.
[1417.70 --> 1420.26]  Way back in the times of Moses.
[1420.26 --> 1422.58]  And they're swimming in their cultural waters too.
[1422.58 --> 1426.58]  When you read your Bibles, read it like that.
[1426.58 --> 1429.48]  It's people like you and I just in different moments in history.
[1429.48 --> 1430.48]  This is our history.
[1430.48 --> 1432.48]  So look at it with me.
[1432.48 --> 1437.86]  Here the writer says, you will have conversations about this with your children in the future.
[1437.86 --> 1441.08]  And this is how they should go.
[1441.08 --> 1448.24]  The child says, what are these precedents, these rules, these judgments the eternal our God
[1448.24 --> 1449.98]  commanded you to obey?
[1449.98 --> 1451.98]  What's that stuff about?
[1451.98 --> 1454.40]  What's the story about?
[1454.40 --> 1455.40]  Ah.
[1455.40 --> 1462.40]  And the parent says, oh, let me tell you about the baton.
[1462.40 --> 1463.86]  Let me tell you about the baton.
[1463.86 --> 1469.56]  Look what the parent says to the child.
[1469.56 --> 1472.72]  We used to be slaves.
[1472.72 --> 1474.36]  In Egypt, to Pharaoh in Egypt.
[1474.36 --> 1476.74]  Talk about culture.
[1476.74 --> 1482.28]  But then the eternal delivered us with overwhelming power.
[1482.28 --> 1485.68]  He sent amazing and awful signs and omens to torment the Egyptians.
[1485.68 --> 1489.02]  Pharaoh and his royal court right before our eyes.
[1489.02 --> 1495.76]  He brought us out of there so that he could bring us here and give us the land he promised
[1495.76 --> 1497.84]  to our ancestors.
[1497.84 --> 1500.90]  He commanded us to remember all the rules to show that we fear him.
[1500.90 --> 1503.38]  And fear in a holy awe-inspiring way.
[1503.38 --> 1508.26]  Our God so that things will always go well for us and so that we can keep living here
[1508.26 --> 1509.62]  as we are now.
[1509.62 --> 1514.06]  If we carefully obey everything the eternal has commanded us, then we'll be living as we
[1514.06 --> 1517.54]  should in righteousness and in right relationship with him.
[1517.54 --> 1521.94]  And we only do that, we as New Testament people know, through the death and resurrection
[1521.94 --> 1526.58]  of Jesus Christ because we didn't do so great with all those laws too.
[1526.58 --> 1529.46]  He is the baton.
[1529.46 --> 1532.94]  It's our history from way back then to now.
[1532.94 --> 1537.10]  And you can see that, yeah, the culture's changed but the story is the same.
[1537.10 --> 1540.62]  History is shaped by God's constant presence and faithfulness.
[1540.62 --> 1547.28]  And this God who freed those slaves from that cultural empire of Egypt, he frees us from
[1547.28 --> 1548.76]  what enslaves us.
[1548.76 --> 1554.92]  In some ways we're culturally enslaved too.
[1554.92 --> 1557.76]  And we need Christ to free us.
[1557.76 --> 1558.76]  Yeah.
[1558.76 --> 1560.76]  Parents, share that with your kids.
[1560.76 --> 1562.76]  What are you freed from?
[1562.76 --> 1565.56]  Grandparents, share that with your grandkids.
[1565.56 --> 1568.76]  What has freedom meant to you?
[1568.76 --> 1571.24]  Things change.
[1571.24 --> 1572.24]  Things change.
[1572.24 --> 1573.24]  Even churches change.
[1573.24 --> 1578.40]  How we gather and, you know, I'm wearing this casual kind of clothes.
[1578.40 --> 1579.92]  That wouldn't have happened when I was a kid.
[1579.92 --> 1582.92]  I would have been asked to leave dressed like this, I think.
[1582.92 --> 1584.24]  But, you know, okay.
[1584.24 --> 1585.24]  Things change.
[1585.24 --> 1586.24]  Music changes.
[1586.24 --> 1588.24]  But the message is consistently the same.
[1588.24 --> 1590.40]  I know there are issues happen and stuff happen.
[1590.40 --> 1595.56]  But Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
[1595.56 --> 1599.16]  That's what we celebrate.
[1599.16 --> 1600.88]  That gives us life.
[1600.88 --> 1603.00]  That unifies us.
[1603.00 --> 1607.16]  Let's do that.
[1607.16 --> 1610.16]  Let's pray.
[1610.16 --> 1617.08]  Father God, we are so grateful that you are our constant.
[1617.08 --> 1621.48]  You are the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
[1621.48 --> 1625.40]  That we can build our lives on the foundation of who you are.
[1625.40 --> 1631.02]  And that when all of life tends to change and there's challenges, you're still the same.
[1631.02 --> 1632.02]  And the baton is still the same.
[1632.02 --> 1635.84]  And Lord, help us to pass the baton on.
[1635.84 --> 1638.20]  Not substitute batons, but you.
[1638.20 --> 1639.20]  Pass you on.
[1639.20 --> 1643.56]  With our kids and our grandkids and our neighbors and our colleagues and our friends.
[1643.56 --> 1647.82]  Lord, help us to pass you on so that you may be glorified.
[1647.82 --> 1650.44]  So that people might know what life really is.
[1650.44 --> 1652.16]  We pray this in your holy name.
[1652.88 --> 1653.14]  Amen.
