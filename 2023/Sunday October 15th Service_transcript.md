[24.00 --> 53.98]  For more information visit www.fema.org
[54.00 --> 83.98]  Thank you.
[84.00 --> 113.98]  Thank you.
[114.00 --> 143.98]  Thank you.
[144.00 --> 173.98]  Thank you.
[174.00 --> 203.98]  Thank you.
[204.00 --> 233.98]  Thank you.
[234.00 --> 263.98]  Thank you.
[264.00 --> 293.98]  Thank you.
[294.00 --> 323.98]  Thank you.
[324.00 --> 353.98]  Thank you.
[354.00 --> 383.98]  Thank you.
[384.00 --> 413.98]  Thank you.
[413.98 --> 443.96]  Thank you.
[443.98 --> 473.96]  Thank you.
[474.48 --> 477.38]  Fourthly, this week we sent you an email, but I'll just say it verbally.
[477.54 --> 482.72]  We started a podcast at our church and Jonathan right here has done all the real work for it.
[482.80 --> 484.70]  So if you love it, make sure you say thank you to him.
[484.96 --> 487.40]  Or if you don't love it, make sure you send your criticism to him.
[487.40 --> 517.40]  But you can find that on Apple podcast, but you can't do it, but you can't do it, but you can't
[517.40 --> 519.40]  do it, and you can't do it, and you can't do it, and you can't do it, and you can't do it, and you can't do it.
[519.40 --> 530.34]  So if you're free at 1.30 p.m. this Tuesday at Willoughby Christian Reformed Church, we're going to do a public examination of Jonathan, ask him all sorts of questions about faith and ministry and all the Bible passages he has to have memorized.
[530.34 --> 533.74]  Come cheer him on, bring confetti, bring a little air horn.
[533.74 --> 534.96]  We're going to make it a celebration.
[534.96 --> 541.50]  And we joked in the 9 a.m. service that if he doesn't pass the exam, it'll get super awkward, but we trust that it's going to be great.
[542.02 --> 543.78]  So that's Tuesday, 1.30 p.m.
[543.82 --> 547.92]  Please, if you're available, you are welcome to join in, listen in, and be part of that.
[550.82 --> 557.34]  Well, I feel the need to remind us every now and then when we gather for worship, who we are and why we are here.
[558.60 --> 563.84]  And I'll say at the outset that we are not just a social club that gathers on Sunday to meet with our friends.
[563.84 --> 569.22]  Nor are we a volunteer organization that gathers to serve a few needs here and there.
[569.66 --> 572.00]  We are the church of Jesus Christ.
[572.58 --> 579.86]  We are bought with his blood, redeemed by the resurrection, and we've gathered here to worship a living God.
[580.12 --> 580.98]  That's why we've gathered.
[581.74 --> 589.62]  And this morning as we enter into worship, I'd like for you to stand to hear God's word, inviting us to see and worship him for who he is.
[593.84 --> 595.54]  This comes from Psalm 96.
[595.54 --> 600.40]  Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[601.24 --> 605.98]  He is to be feared above all gods, for the gods of the nations are idols.
[606.80 --> 608.08]  But the Lord made the heavens.
[608.76 --> 610.70]  Splendor and majesty are before him.
[611.10 --> 613.86]  Strength and glory are in his sanctuary.
[614.82 --> 617.02]  So ascribe to the Lord, you families of nations.
[617.92 --> 620.54]  Ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
[621.48 --> 624.46]  Ascribe to the Lord the glory that is due his name.
[624.46 --> 627.34]  Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.
[628.12 --> 630.06]  Tremble before him all the earth.
[630.50 --> 633.08]  Say among the nations, the Lord reigns.
[633.48 --> 634.46]  Let's worship together.
[634.46 --> 640.50]  Show your power.
[640.50 --> 642.20]  Show your power.
[642.20 --> 645.86]  Oh Lord our God.
[645.86 --> 649.34]  Show your power.
[650.42 --> 654.84]  Oh Lord our God.
[655.04 --> 658.30]  Show your power.
[658.30 --> 663.64]  O Lord our God
[663.64 --> 667.02]  Show your power
[667.02 --> 672.40]  O Lord our God
[672.40 --> 675.10]  Our God
[675.10 --> 684.10]  He is the Lord
[684.10 --> 686.30]  He reigns on high
[686.30 --> 690.24]  He is the Lord
[690.24 --> 693.00]  Spoken to the darkness
[693.00 --> 695.16]  Created the light
[695.16 --> 698.90]  He is the Lord
[698.90 --> 701.78]  Who is like unto Him
[701.78 --> 704.16]  Never ending in days
[704.16 --> 707.76]  He is the Lord
[707.76 --> 710.70]  And becomes in power
[710.70 --> 712.94]  When we call on His name
[712.94 --> 716.88]  He is the Lord
[716.88 --> 720.20]  Show your power
[720.20 --> 725.72]  O Lord our God
[725.72 --> 729.10]  Show your power
[729.10 --> 734.04]  O Lord our God
[734.04 --> 736.04]  Our God
[736.04 --> 736.36]  Our God
[736.36 --> 745.04]  Your gospel Lord
[745.04 --> 748.48]  Is the hope for our nation
[748.48 --> 751.80]  You are the Lord
[751.80 --> 755.00]  It's the power of God
[755.00 --> 757.24]  For our salvation
[757.24 --> 760.74]  You are the Lord
[760.74 --> 763.74]  We ask for riches
[763.74 --> 763.90]  We ask for riches
[763.90 --> 766.00]  But look to the cross
[766.00 --> 769.60]  You are the Lord
[769.60 --> 772.92]  And for our inheritance
[772.92 --> 774.72]  Give us the lost
[774.72 --> 778.48]  You are the Lord
[778.48 --> 782.16]  Show your power
[782.16 --> 783.90]  Show your power
[783.90 --> 787.44]  O Lord our God
[787.44 --> 790.84]  Show your power
[790.84 --> 796.22]  O Lord our God
[796.22 --> 798.48]  Send your spirit
[798.48 --> 799.48]  Send your spirit
[799.48 --> 805.48]  O Lord our God
[805.48 --> 808.42]  Send your spirit
[808.42 --> 813.06]  O Lord our God
[813.06 --> 814.56]  Show your spirit
[814.56 --> 816.46]  Show yourẽ
[816.46 --> 817.60]  Show your power
[817.60 --> 818.56]  Show your power
[818.56 --> 822.56]  Show your power
[822.56 --> 823.94]  Show your power
[823.94 --> 828.18]  Show your power
[841.32 --> 842.00]  Sh 안 binnen
[842.00 --> 846.52]  Shine your light and let the whole world see
[846.52 --> 849.46]  That we're singing for the glory of the risen King
[849.46 --> 863.26]  Everyone needs compassion
[863.26 --> 866.94]  Love that's never failing
[866.94 --> 873.92]  Let mercy fall on me
[873.92 --> 877.24]  Everyone needs forgiveness
[877.24 --> 880.78]  The kindness of a Savior
[880.78 --> 886.94]  The hope of nations
[886.94 --> 898.02]  Savior, He can move the mountain
[898.02 --> 902.50]  My God is mighty to save
[902.50 --> 906.26]  He is mighty to save
[906.26 --> 911.32]  Forever, author of salvation
[911.32 --> 915.68]  He rose and conquered the grave
[915.68 --> 919.30]  Jesus conquered the grave
[919.30 --> 938.28]  So take me as you find me
[938.28 --> 941.94]  All my fears of failure
[941.94 --> 947.88]  I fill my life again
[947.88 --> 951.50]  I give my life to follow
[951.50 --> 956.26]  Everything I believe in
[956.26 --> 960.30]  Now I surrender

[1065.86 --> 1073.48]  We're singing for the glory of the risen King
[1073.48 --> 1078.32]  Please join me in a prayer of confession
[1078.32 --> 1082.20]  Everything we have belongs to you, God
[1082.20 --> 1085.08]  You have given us many incredible blessings
[1085.08 --> 1087.80]  Foremost, the gift of your Son, Jesus
[1087.80 --> 1090.94]  Lord, you have given us the gift of our time
[1090.94 --> 1092.60]  And talents and resources
[1092.60 --> 1094.92]  Help us to be your stewards
[1094.92 --> 1097.04]  By giving and helping others in need
[1097.04 --> 1100.76]  Forgive us, Lord, for worrying about the future
[1100.76 --> 1103.44]  As your plans for us already have an outcome
[1103.44 --> 1106.06]  Lord, we know if we rest in you

[1549.66 --> 1550.60]  Growing your family
[1550.60 --> 1551.64]  And your story
[1551.64 --> 1552.86]  Is one of pursuing adoption
[1552.86 --> 1553.48]  I'd love for you
[1553.48 --> 1554.18]  To talk a little bit
[1554.18 --> 1554.72]  About that
[1554.72 --> 1555.60]  Sure
[1555.60 --> 1557.40]  So we started dating

[1562.20 --> 1564.90]  Even when we were dating
[1564.90 --> 1565.94]  We were chatting
[1565.94 --> 1566.92]  About adoption
[1566.92 --> 1568.24]  And how we
[1568.24 --> 1568.74]  Kind of felt
[1568.74 --> 1569.54]  Led to it
[1569.54 --> 1570.54]  Called to it
[1570.54 --> 1572.56]  Then we got married
[1572.56 --> 1573.22]  In 2007
[1573.22 --> 1574.24]  And
[1574.24 --> 1576.90]  We knew that
[1576.90 --> 1577.44]  That's the way
[1577.44 --> 1578.14]  We wanted to grow
[1578.14 --> 1578.60]  Our family
[1578.60 --> 1579.64]  So that was option A
[1579.64 --> 1580.14]  Or yeah
[1580.14 --> 1581.10]  Option A for us
[1581.10 --> 1584.06]  The only way
[1584.06 --> 1584.60]  I can think
[1584.60 --> 1585.32]  To explain it
[1585.32 --> 1586.18]  Is that God
[1586.18 --> 1586.82]  Put this plan
[1586.82 --> 1587.44]  On our hearts
[1587.44 --> 1589.02]  From very early on
[1589.02 --> 1589.94]  We knew adoption
[1589.94 --> 1590.94]  Would be our root
[1590.94 --> 1592.24]  We recognize
[1592.24 --> 1593.32]  That might seem unique
[1593.32 --> 1594.22]  And I think God
[1594.22 --> 1595.16]  Had a plan for us
[1595.16 --> 1596.40]  And that explains
[1596.40 --> 1597.00]  Why we felt
[1597.00 --> 1597.70]  So comfortable
[1597.70 --> 1598.50]  With the idea
[1598.50 --> 1599.16]  Of the unknown
[1599.16 --> 1600.18]  Because usually
[1600.18 --> 1601.02]  That is not
[1601.02 --> 1602.40]  How I live my life
[1602.40 --> 1604.64]  I'm still processing
[1604.64 --> 1605.38]  The fact that you
[1605.38 --> 1606.28]  Talked about adoption
[1606.28 --> 1606.94]  Together when you
[1606.94 --> 1607.32]  Were dating
[1607.32 --> 1608.22]  That's phenomenal
[1608.22 --> 1610.42]  Now you chose
[1610.42 --> 1612.22]  A local adoption
[1612.22 --> 1613.36]  Over international
[1613.36 --> 1614.00]  I'd love for you
[1614.00 --> 1614.64]  To talk a little bit
[1614.64 --> 1615.32]  About that process
[1615.32 --> 1615.90]  And what made you
[1615.90 --> 1616.48]  Decide that
[1616.48 --> 1617.22]  Sure
[1617.22 --> 1618.86]  Before I do that
[1618.86 --> 1619.26]  The reason why
[1619.26 --> 1619.78]  You have notes
[1619.78 --> 1621.24]  Is that our story
[1621.24 --> 1621.90]  Of our family
[1621.90 --> 1622.32]  Is like
[1622.32 --> 1623.64]  I joke this morning
[1623.64 --> 1625.16]  It's like a seven hour story
[1625.16 --> 1626.20]  We could talk for a long time
[1626.20 --> 1626.40]  About it
[1626.40 --> 1627.74]  So we don't want
[1627.74 --> 1628.22]  To forget anything
[1628.22 --> 1628.86]  That's why we have it
[1628.86 --> 1629.58]  All written out
[1629.58 --> 1631.68]  So yeah
[1631.68 --> 1632.20]  We have multiple
[1632.20 --> 1632.96]  Family members
[1632.96 --> 1635.46]  That have adopted
[1635.46 --> 1636.76]  Locally or internationally
[1636.76 --> 1639.42]  So it wasn't new to us
[1639.42 --> 1640.42]  But it was obviously
[1640.42 --> 1641.02]  New to us
[1641.02 --> 1641.86]  Because we had never
[1641.86 --> 1642.74]  Dealt with it personally
[1642.74 --> 1645.76]  Yeah so
[1645.76 --> 1646.92]  Sorry
[1646.92 --> 1649.16]  Yeah so we learned
[1649.16 --> 1650.40]  Many years ago
[1650.40 --> 1650.98]  That there was
[1650.98 --> 1651.48]  International
[1651.48 --> 1651.98]  Domestic
[1651.98 --> 1652.44]  And then there was
[1652.44 --> 1653.68]  The waiting child list
[1653.68 --> 1654.58]  In BC
[1654.58 --> 1656.88]  And we filled
[1656.88 --> 1657.42]  A natural
[1657.42 --> 1658.34]  Pull
[1658.34 --> 1660.68]  To domestic
[1660.68 --> 1661.60]  To local adoption
[1661.60 --> 1663.86]  Meaning we'd be adopting
[1663.86 --> 1664.56]  A newborn baby
[1664.56 --> 1665.60]  In BC
[1665.60 --> 1667.44]  It sounded
[1667.44 --> 1668.26]  The least complicated
[1668.26 --> 1668.80]  To us
[1668.80 --> 1669.96]  Which sounds very
[1669.96 --> 1670.40]  Funny
[1670.40 --> 1671.38]  Saying it out loud
[1671.38 --> 1672.94]  But we learned
[1672.94 --> 1673.36]  First hand
[1673.36 --> 1674.30]  That over the next
[1674.30 --> 1674.62]  Ten years
[1674.62 --> 1675.32]  That every adoption
[1675.32 --> 1675.86]  Is unique
[1675.86 --> 1676.74]  And things definitely
[1676.74 --> 1677.44]  Got complicated
[1677.44 --> 1678.52]  Fast
[1678.52 --> 1679.46]  One second
[1679.46 --> 1680.86]  Pictures up there
[1680.86 --> 1681.72]  Those are our girls
[1681.72 --> 1682.80]  That's Nora
[1682.80 --> 1684.30]  The one year old
[1684.30 --> 1684.98]  And then Ava
[1684.98 --> 1686.02]  Is eight in the back
[1686.02 --> 1689.08]  So just to give you
[1689.08 --> 1689.68]  An idea
[1689.68 --> 1690.56]  About what
[1690.56 --> 1692.34]  Local adoption
[1692.34 --> 1693.48]  Just what the process
[1693.48 --> 1693.90]  Is like
[1693.90 --> 1695.66]  We did a home study
[1695.66 --> 1696.78]  So that means
[1696.78 --> 1697.60]  A social worker
[1697.60 --> 1698.20]  Met with us
[1698.20 --> 1698.88]  Several times
[1698.88 --> 1699.76]  And learned about us
[1699.76 --> 1701.14]  As individuals
[1701.14 --> 1702.28]  So our childhood
[1702.28 --> 1703.08]  Our families
[1703.08 --> 1704.40]  And then us as a couple
[1704.40 --> 1706.44]  So all about our marriage
[1706.44 --> 1707.04]  And our goals
[1707.04 --> 1707.68]  And values
[1707.68 --> 1709.30]  Then the social worker
[1709.30 --> 1710.66]  Wrote up a report
[1710.66 --> 1711.32]  About us
[1711.32 --> 1712.78]  And how we envisioned
[1712.78 --> 1714.50]  Parenting and family life
[1714.50 --> 1714.80]  To be
[1714.80 --> 1716.94]  We also had to make
[1716.94 --> 1717.56]  A profile
[1717.56 --> 1719.14]  Highlighting us as a couple
[1719.14 --> 1720.38]  Basically advertising
[1720.38 --> 1721.96]  Ourselves on two pieces
[1721.96 --> 1722.40]  Of paper
[1722.40 --> 1725.10]  A pregnant woman
[1725.10 --> 1725.70]  Would then
[1725.70 --> 1727.50]  If a pregnant woman
[1727.50 --> 1728.42]  Came to the agency
[1728.42 --> 1729.44]  Wanting to make
[1729.44 --> 1730.24]  An adoption plan
[1730.24 --> 1731.28]  She would then
[1731.28 --> 1732.04]  Look through all those
[1732.04 --> 1732.56]  Profiles
[1732.56 --> 1733.30]  And decide
[1733.30 --> 1734.88]  Who she wants to meet
[1734.88 --> 1737.78]  And so at that point
[1737.78 --> 1739.04]  We would just wait
[1739.04 --> 1739.62]  For a call
[1739.62 --> 1741.44]  So we were aware
[1741.44 --> 1742.32]  That we might never
[1742.32 --> 1742.98]  Get that call
[1742.98 --> 1744.50]  Since we weren't
[1744.50 --> 1745.50]  On a list
[1745.50 --> 1746.62]  We weren't in a line
[1746.62 --> 1747.74]  It was waiting
[1747.74 --> 1748.56]  To get chosen
[1748.56 --> 1750.48]  That's one of the things
[1750.48 --> 1751.14]  That really stood out
[1751.14 --> 1751.42]  To me
[1751.42 --> 1752.10]  When you shared this
[1752.10 --> 1752.84]  To me the first time
[1752.84 --> 1753.50]  That when you do
[1753.50 --> 1754.12]  Local adoption
[1754.12 --> 1754.74]  In this way
[1754.74 --> 1756.42]  There's no promises
[1756.42 --> 1757.50]  That there's going
[1757.50 --> 1758.02]  To be a timeline
[1758.02 --> 1759.08]  At which you'll receive
[1759.08 --> 1759.52]  A child
[1759.52 --> 1760.06]  It's just like
[1760.06 --> 1760.96]  You could never get it
[1760.96 --> 1762.04]  Yeah
[1762.04 --> 1762.94]  So when we left
[1762.94 --> 1763.78]  Our initial meeting
[1763.78 --> 1764.50]  The lady said
[1764.50 --> 1765.74]  The director of the agency
[1765.74 --> 1766.14]  Said yeah
[1766.14 --> 1767.08]  You can get a call tomorrow
[1767.08 --> 1768.08]  Or you can never get a call
[1768.08 --> 1769.12]  She was very blunt
[1769.12 --> 1769.62]  About that
[1769.62 --> 1770.62]  So that was very like
[1770.62 --> 1772.30]  Oh okay
[1772.30 --> 1772.90]  Good to know
[1772.90 --> 1773.28]  Like
[1773.28 --> 1774.92]  It was pretty stunning
[1774.92 --> 1776.52]  Okay
[1776.52 --> 1777.54]  Yeah
[1777.54 --> 1777.90]  So
[1777.90 --> 1778.40]  Go ahead
[1778.40 --> 1779.22]  Tell us about
[1779.22 --> 1779.90]  How Ava came into
[1779.90 --> 1780.24]  Your family
[1780.24 --> 1780.34]  Yeah
[1780.34 --> 1781.30]  So our oldest
[1781.30 --> 1781.98]  Ava
[1781.98 --> 1784.14]  Eight years ago
[1784.14 --> 1786.02]  Well sorry
[1786.02 --> 1787.36]  After two years of waiting
[1787.36 --> 1788.62]  Which felt like forever
[1788.62 --> 1789.12]  For us
[1789.12 --> 1791.10]  I got a call
[1791.10 --> 1791.64]  On a Friday
[1791.64 --> 1793.34]  August 10, 2015
[1793.34 --> 1794.36]  Letting us know
[1794.36 --> 1795.04]  That a birth mom
[1795.04 --> 1795.92]  Wanted to meet us
[1795.92 --> 1796.82]  And only us
[1796.82 --> 1797.62]  So
[1797.62 --> 1798.26]  And she was due
[1798.26 --> 1798.86]  Really soon
[1798.86 --> 1800.44]  Nicole was at work
[1800.44 --> 1801.32]  And I got to tell her
[1801.32 --> 1802.04]  The news in person
[1802.04 --> 1802.68]  When she got home
[1802.68 --> 1803.64]  It was one of the
[1803.64 --> 1804.24]  Funnest conversations
[1804.24 --> 1805.02]  I've ever had to have
[1805.02 --> 1805.46]  With somebody
[1805.46 --> 1807.68]  Yeah so we met
[1807.68 --> 1808.30]  A couple days later
[1808.30 --> 1808.70]  We met
[1808.70 --> 1809.92]  Ava's birth mom
[1809.92 --> 1811.96]  And she was a total sweetheart
[1811.96 --> 1812.66]  And we had a great
[1812.66 --> 1813.26]  First connection
[1813.26 --> 1814.40]  The following day
[1814.40 --> 1814.98]  We got a call
[1814.98 --> 1815.80]  That she was in labor
[1815.80 --> 1817.10]  Nicole was realizing
[1817.10 --> 1818.16]  It was her last day of work
[1818.16 --> 1820.70]  Hours later
[1820.70 --> 1821.44]  We got another call
[1821.44 --> 1822.28]  That a healthy baby girl
[1822.28 --> 1823.24]  Was born in Chilliwack
[1823.24 --> 1824.74]  We went the next day
[1824.74 --> 1825.18]  To meet her
[1825.18 --> 1825.98]  And spent the whole day
[1825.98 --> 1826.52]  At the hospital
[1826.52 --> 1827.90]  In the room
[1827.90 --> 1828.98]  With Ava and her birth mom
[1828.98 --> 1829.92]  Basically in awe
[1829.92 --> 1830.74]  And it was just
[1830.74 --> 1831.60]  A really memorable day
[1831.60 --> 1832.38]  We were there for like
[1832.38 --> 1834.14]  Twelve hours
[1834.14 --> 1835.38]  Like it was a long day
[1835.38 --> 1836.18]  It was amazing
[1836.18 --> 1838.60]  And then the following day
[1838.60 --> 1840.74]  We got to take Ava home
[1840.74 --> 1841.72]  And started scheduling visits
[1841.72 --> 1842.46]  With all our family
[1842.46 --> 1843.28]  And friends
[1843.28 --> 1844.08]  So they could come meet her
[1844.08 --> 1847.00]  It was the most surreal experience
[1847.00 --> 1849.96]  Going from not knowing
[1849.96 --> 1850.54]  To from
[1850.54 --> 1851.64]  It was like six days
[1851.64 --> 1853.10]  From the initial phone call
[1853.10 --> 1854.86]  To Ava in her arms
[1854.86 --> 1855.74]  That night
[1855.74 --> 1857.40]  And everyone signed
[1857.40 --> 1857.84]  The paperwork
[1857.84 --> 1858.38]  That was needed
[1858.38 --> 1859.26]  It was pretty flawless
[1859.26 --> 1860.06]  In the way
[1860.06 --> 1861.42]  The local adoption goes
[1861.42 --> 1863.64]  And it's a
[1863.64 --> 1865.22]  We have an open adoption
[1865.22 --> 1866.64]  With Ava's birth parents
[1866.64 --> 1868.00]  So we
[1868.00 --> 1869.64]  We meet up with them
[1869.64 --> 1870.18]  Once in a while
[1870.18 --> 1871.48]  And there's some correspondence
[1871.48 --> 1872.06]  Back and forth
[1872.06 --> 1875.92]  So now you're a family of three
[1875.92 --> 1877.00]  Ava's in your home
[1877.00 --> 1879.14]  What was the process like
[1879.14 --> 1879.44]  Of saying
[1879.44 --> 1880.52]  Okay we want to consider
[1880.52 --> 1881.72]  Another adoption
[1881.72 --> 1883.00]  Talk about that
[1883.00 --> 1883.62]  So
[1883.62 --> 1886.18]  Ava was two years old
[1886.18 --> 1887.52]  When we made our profile
[1887.52 --> 1888.26]  Active again
[1888.26 --> 1889.36]  With our agency
[1889.36 --> 1891.12]  And we began waiting
[1891.12 --> 1892.96]  After three years
[1892.96 --> 1894.16]  We seriously considered
[1894.16 --> 1895.20]  Telling our agency
[1895.20 --> 1895.98]  That we didn't want
[1895.98 --> 1896.82]  To pursue anymore
[1896.82 --> 1898.52]  And to take down our profile
[1898.52 --> 1900.68]  Ava was about to turn five
[1900.68 --> 1902.36]  And for some reason
[1902.36 --> 1903.18]  This seemed like a number
[1903.18 --> 1904.04]  That was too big
[1904.04 --> 1904.72]  Of an age gap
[1904.72 --> 1908.58]  And it felt like the waiting
[1908.58 --> 1909.26]  Was never ending
[1909.26 --> 1911.10]  We drafted up an email
[1911.10 --> 1912.70]  To send to our family
[1912.70 --> 1914.10]  Explaining that we made
[1914.10 --> 1914.84]  The Tufts decision
[1914.84 --> 1916.02]  To close this chapter
[1916.02 --> 1918.12]  And that we'd be a family
[1918.12 --> 1918.62]  Of three
[1918.62 --> 1921.48]  And I was about to press
[1921.48 --> 1922.68]  Send on this email
[1922.68 --> 1924.14]  And Colin hesitated
[1924.14 --> 1926.44]  And asked to wait a day
[1926.44 --> 1928.84]  The next morning
[1928.84 --> 1929.56]  We get a call
[1929.56 --> 1930.84]  That there's a young couple
[1930.84 --> 1931.80]  That's chosen us
[1931.80 --> 1933.80]  She's due in a few weeks
[1933.80 --> 1935.24]  I laughed
[1935.24 --> 1936.18]  In disbelief
[1936.18 --> 1938.30]  We were over the moon
[1938.30 --> 1939.02]  Excited
[1939.02 --> 1940.46]  And telling Ava
[1940.46 --> 1941.20]  Was the funnest
[1941.20 --> 1943.26]  Telling Ava
[1943.26 --> 1944.32]  Was the funnest part
[1944.32 --> 1946.24]  This was in 2020
[1946.24 --> 1947.54]  So we met
[1947.54 --> 1948.28]  The birth parents
[1948.28 --> 1948.92]  Over Zoom
[1948.92 --> 1950.72]  They even liked
[1950.72 --> 1951.84]  The name we had in mind
[1951.84 --> 1953.46]  And everything
[1953.46 --> 1954.70]  Was looking very positive
[1954.70 --> 1957.30]  She went into early labor
[1957.30 --> 1958.82]  And we arrived
[1958.82 --> 1959.90]  After the baby boy
[1959.90 --> 1960.48]  Was born
[1960.48 --> 1963.08]  It was in the same hospital
[1963.08 --> 1965.26]  And the same hospital room
[1965.26 --> 1966.54]  That we were in with Ava
[1966.54 --> 1968.12]  When she was born
[1968.12 --> 1970.82]  It was all very much
[1970.82 --> 1972.56]  Feeling like it was meant to be
[1972.56 --> 1975.56]  Yeah so we named him Orion
[1975.56 --> 1977.22]  And we took him home
[1977.22 --> 1978.18]  The next day to Ava
[1978.18 --> 1979.82]  A very excited big sister
[1979.82 --> 1980.74]  The first couple days
[1980.74 --> 1981.30]  Were amazing
[1981.30 --> 1982.62]  And then things started
[1982.62 --> 1983.92]  To fall apart quickly
[1983.92 --> 1985.62]  We were hearing
[1985.62 --> 1986.56]  That from a social worker
[1986.56 --> 1988.00]  That the birth parents
[1988.00 --> 1989.10]  Were having a difficult time
[1989.10 --> 1989.98]  With their decision
[1989.98 --> 1991.28]  This was very understandable
[1991.28 --> 1992.24]  And normal
[1992.24 --> 1993.58]  So we were doing our best
[1993.58 --> 1994.12]  To hold space
[1994.12 --> 1994.74]  For their feelings
[1994.74 --> 1996.18]  And also trying to enjoy
[1996.18 --> 1997.04]  Our new family of four
[1997.04 --> 1998.76]  So it was really
[1998.76 --> 2000.16]  Really difficult
[2000.16 --> 2001.30]  Knowing that
[2001.30 --> 2002.32]  There was like
[2002.32 --> 2003.38]  Kind of turmoil
[2003.38 --> 2004.04]  Over here
[2004.04 --> 2004.56]  And then like
[2004.56 --> 2005.74]  Trying to be excited here
[2005.74 --> 2006.66]  Knowing that
[2006.66 --> 2007.88]  Things were just not going well
[2007.88 --> 2009.08]  That was a very hard part
[2009.08 --> 2011.18]  Both birth parents
[2011.18 --> 2012.16]  Had their own challenges
[2012.16 --> 2013.20]  And especially after
[2013.20 --> 2013.98]  Meeting them in person
[2013.98 --> 2014.50]  At the hospital
[2014.50 --> 2015.42]  It seemed that
[2015.42 --> 2016.08]  There was no way
[2016.08 --> 2016.76]  That they were capable
[2016.76 --> 2017.92]  Of parenting at the time
[2017.92 --> 2021.22]  It was not just
[2021.22 --> 2022.74]  Our own wishful thinking
[2022.74 --> 2023.66]  It was members
[2023.66 --> 2024.80]  Of their family as well
[2024.80 --> 2026.22]  That thought an adoption plan
[2026.22 --> 2026.82]  Would be best
[2026.82 --> 2027.90]  For this baby
[2027.90 --> 2030.04]  With local adoption
[2030.04 --> 2030.98]  In BC
[2030.98 --> 2031.76]  The birth mother
[2031.76 --> 2033.24]  Has 30 days
[2033.24 --> 2034.50]  From the birth date
[2034.50 --> 2035.58]  To revoke her decision
[2035.58 --> 2036.66]  To adopt
[2036.66 --> 2038.28]  So we knew this
[2038.28 --> 2038.80]  Going in
[2038.80 --> 2040.10]  And every day that passed
[2040.10 --> 2041.24]  Got harder and harder
[2041.24 --> 2044.50]  We had a lot of hope
[2044.50 --> 2045.46]  In those first few days
[2045.46 --> 2046.52]  And then we became
[2046.52 --> 2047.06]  Very worried
[2047.06 --> 2048.32]  That not only our dream
[2048.32 --> 2049.78]  Was turning into a nightmare
[2049.78 --> 2051.40]  But we were also worried
[2051.40 --> 2051.94]  About the thought
[2051.94 --> 2053.16]  Of this vulnerable baby
[2053.16 --> 2053.88]  Being taken to
[2053.88 --> 2054.68]  What we believed
[2054.68 --> 2055.62]  Would be a very
[2055.62 --> 2056.50]  Unsafe environment
[2056.50 --> 2058.78]  So three weeks
[2058.78 --> 2059.50]  After he was brought
[2059.50 --> 2060.12]  Into our family
[2060.12 --> 2061.24]  He was taken away
[2061.24 --> 2063.76]  He was
[2063.76 --> 2067.24]  He was brought
[2067.24 --> 2068.08]  To his first family
[2068.08 --> 2068.86]  And within a week
[2068.86 --> 2069.70]  He was removed
[2069.70 --> 2070.52]  By the ministry
[2070.52 --> 2071.98]  And placed into foster care
[2071.98 --> 2074.44]  We fought so hard
[2074.44 --> 2075.06]  For weeks
[2075.06 --> 2075.82]  With lawyers
[2075.82 --> 2077.84]  And we must have logged
[2077.84 --> 2080.00]  I don't know
[2080.00 --> 2082.08]  70 hours on the phone
[2082.08 --> 2082.96]  Over a month
[2082.96 --> 2083.30]  It was just
[2083.30 --> 2084.64]  It was incredible
[2084.64 --> 2087.16]  But we were out of options
[2087.16 --> 2088.26]  There was simply
[2088.26 --> 2088.94]  Nothing we could do
[2088.94 --> 2089.96]  It was out of our control
[2089.96 --> 2090.42]  At that time
[2090.42 --> 2092.60]  So we experienced
[2092.60 --> 2093.30]  Things very differently
[2093.30 --> 2094.40]  At the time
[2094.40 --> 2096.20]  It hit me really hard
[2096.20 --> 2097.38]  And really fast
[2097.38 --> 2098.64]  And I got really angry
[2098.64 --> 2101.56]  I got just paced
[2101.56 --> 2102.20]  For the whole day
[2102.20 --> 2104.16]  And at the same time
[2104.16 --> 2105.44]  Yeah it was
[2105.44 --> 2106.88]  It was a longer
[2106.88 --> 2108.10]  Slower burn for Nicole
[2108.10 --> 2109.46]  She was feeling
[2109.46 --> 2110.24]  Extreme disappointment
[2110.24 --> 2110.86]  And sadness
[2110.86 --> 2112.26]  We thought in the beginning
[2112.26 --> 2113.04]  It was all meant to be
[2113.04 --> 2114.22]  And then suffered
[2114.22 --> 2114.98]  Extreme heartbreak
[2114.98 --> 2116.30]  The toughest part
[2116.30 --> 2116.90]  Having to tell
[2116.90 --> 2117.36]  Sorry
[2117.36 --> 2118.20]  The toughest part
[2118.20 --> 2119.18]  Was having to tell Ava
[2119.18 --> 2120.42]  And also not knowing
[2120.42 --> 2121.06]  If Ryan was going
[2121.06 --> 2121.50]  To be okay
[2121.50 --> 2123.52]  So Ava was old enough
[2123.52 --> 2124.68]  To grow attached
[2124.68 --> 2125.42]  To him very quickly
[2125.42 --> 2126.36]  And in her mind
[2126.36 --> 2127.18]  This was her brother
[2127.18 --> 2129.30]  But she wasn't old enough
[2129.30 --> 2129.86]  To understand
[2129.86 --> 2131.56]  Why he had to leave
[2131.56 --> 2132.68]  And we weren't able
[2132.68 --> 2133.70]  To give her great answers
[2133.70 --> 2134.76]  Because we couldn't
[2134.76 --> 2136.00]  Understand it ourselves
[2136.00 --> 2140.66]  I'm just feeling
[2140.66 --> 2141.26]  The heaviness of that
[2141.26 --> 2141.72]  All over again
[2141.72 --> 2142.54]  I've already heard this
[2142.54 --> 2143.20]  In the 9 a.m.
[2144.08 --> 2145.30]  The question I have written
[2145.30 --> 2145.98]  I'll just ask
[2145.98 --> 2147.52]  Looking back
[2147.52 --> 2148.52]  How do you see God
[2148.52 --> 2149.40]  Working in that season
[2149.40 --> 2150.52]  Of extreme difficulty
[2150.52 --> 2152.04]  Yeah so the benefit
[2152.04 --> 2153.30]  Of going through
[2153.30 --> 2154.80]  A very challenging experience
[2154.80 --> 2155.92]  Is what we saw
[2155.92 --> 2156.46]  First hand
[2156.46 --> 2157.78]  Of how much people
[2157.78 --> 2158.62]  Around us really cared
[2158.62 --> 2159.40]  And loved for us
[2159.40 --> 2160.94]  The prayers and support
[2160.94 --> 2161.64]  Were so meaningful
[2161.64 --> 2162.92]  And it was really a blessing
[2162.92 --> 2163.98]  To see their hearts in action
[2163.98 --> 2165.34]  At the time
[2165.34 --> 2165.94]  My mother-in-law
[2165.94 --> 2166.62]  Told us
[2166.62 --> 2167.46]  Keep the faith
[2167.46 --> 2168.90]  There has to be more
[2168.90 --> 2169.66]  To this story
[2169.66 --> 2171.54]  We knew after having
[2171.54 --> 2172.42]  Ryan in our home
[2172.42 --> 2173.40]  For just three weeks
[2173.40 --> 2174.86]  We very much wanted
[2174.86 --> 2175.84]  To be a family of four now
[2175.84 --> 2177.00]  This was no doubt
[2177.00 --> 2179.08]  So God gave us the strength
[2179.08 --> 2180.66]  To open ourselves up
[2180.66 --> 2182.68]  Again to the unknown
[2182.68 --> 2183.86]  In another attempt
[2183.86 --> 2185.08]  To make our dreams come true
[2185.08 --> 2186.08]  So we made our profile
[2186.08 --> 2186.66]  Active again
[2186.66 --> 2188.00]  After about four months
[2188.00 --> 2192.06]  I remember at the time
[2192.06 --> 2194.92]  It was really hard
[2194.92 --> 2196.20]  The song Waymaker
[2196.20 --> 2198.22]  Was so hard to listen to
[2198.22 --> 2201.44]  I loved that song before
[2201.44 --> 2202.74]  And during this time
[2202.74 --> 2204.50]  I was not feeling
[2204.50 --> 2205.12]  The same way
[2205.12 --> 2207.64]  It was difficult
[2207.64 --> 2208.48]  To see at the time
[2208.48 --> 2210.70]  But looking back
[2210.70 --> 2212.48]  Even when we don't see it
[2212.48 --> 2212.88]  Or feel it
[2212.88 --> 2213.54]  God is working
[2213.54 --> 2214.94]  And he does not stop
[2214.94 --> 2216.84]  We now see
[2216.84 --> 2217.56]  All the things
[2217.56 --> 2218.24]  That had to happen
[2218.24 --> 2218.82]  And line up
[2218.82 --> 2219.88]  To get us to be
[2219.88 --> 2221.66]  The family we are today
[2221.66 --> 2223.26]  And we didn't know
[2223.26 --> 2224.02]  But all along
[2224.02 --> 2225.40]  We were waiting for Nora
[2225.40 --> 2229.64]  Talk about that waiting process
[2229.64 --> 2236.78]  So at the time
[2236.78 --> 2237.66]  When we got our profile
[2237.66 --> 2238.26]  Active again
[2238.26 --> 2239.86]  We didn't tell Ava
[2239.86 --> 2240.64]  That we were hoping
[2240.64 --> 2241.36]  To adopt again
[2241.36 --> 2242.20]  We were just hoping
[2242.20 --> 2243.36]  We could surprise her one day
[2243.36 --> 2245.28]  We didn't want her to wait
[2245.28 --> 2245.82]  For something that
[2245.82 --> 2246.82]  May never happen
[2246.82 --> 2248.60]  Waiting was really
[2248.60 --> 2249.38]  Really difficult
[2249.38 --> 2252.70]  Every pregnancy announcement
[2252.70 --> 2253.42]  Was tough
[2253.42 --> 2254.38]  I think there were
[2254.38 --> 2256.00]  About ten babies
[2256.00 --> 2257.42]  Born in our immediate families
[2257.42 --> 2258.48]  During all the waiting
[2258.48 --> 2259.02]  That we did
[2259.02 --> 2260.68]  And even though
[2260.68 --> 2261.56]  Everyone close to us
[2261.56 --> 2262.54]  Was so sensitive
[2262.54 --> 2263.42]  About our situation
[2263.42 --> 2264.34]  It was still difficult
[2264.34 --> 2264.80]  To hear
[2264.80 --> 2267.88]  And the last announcement
[2267.88 --> 2269.04]  Was from my sister
[2269.04 --> 2269.74]  Lindsay
[2269.74 --> 2272.90]  In October of 2021
[2272.90 --> 2273.64]  She told me
[2273.64 --> 2274.22]  She was pregnant
[2274.22 --> 2276.00]  And I was really happy
[2276.00 --> 2276.38]  For her
[2276.38 --> 2277.50]  I knew she was so excited
[2277.50 --> 2279.20]  And at the same time
[2279.20 --> 2279.88]  It was hard
[2279.88 --> 2282.24]  She told me
[2282.24 --> 2284.04]  It is my big hope
[2284.04 --> 2285.04]  That we have babies
[2285.04 --> 2286.04]  Together next year
[2286.04 --> 2287.16]  And I will keep
[2287.16 --> 2288.06]  Praying for you guys
[2288.06 --> 2290.26]  And I smiled at the thought
[2290.26 --> 2291.50]  But I never thought
[2291.50 --> 2292.06]  It would happen
[2292.06 --> 2294.60]  Nine months later
[2294.60 --> 2295.68]  Nora was born
[2295.68 --> 2296.78]  And those cousins
[2296.78 --> 2297.86]  Are five weeks apart
[2297.86 --> 2301.70]  Feel free to share
[2301.70 --> 2302.24]  About how Nora
[2302.24 --> 2303.10]  Came into your family
[2303.10 --> 2304.76]  This is the fun part
[2304.76 --> 2305.38]  Yes
[2305.38 --> 2308.20]  So we had hope
[2308.20 --> 2309.38]  But we were not
[2309.38 --> 2310.20]  Very optimistic
[2310.20 --> 2311.96]  Our agency does
[2311.96 --> 2313.52]  Roughly 20 domestic
[2313.52 --> 2314.46]  Placements each year
[2314.46 --> 2315.66]  So not very many
[2315.66 --> 2319.94]  August 16, 2022
[2319.94 --> 2321.42]  We're driving to
[2321.42 --> 2322.00]  Cultus Lake
[2322.00 --> 2323.18]  Just the three of us
[2323.18 --> 2325.34]  And my phone rings
[2325.34 --> 2326.52]  At 1222
[2326.52 --> 2329.28]  I pulled over
[2329.28 --> 2330.04]  To take the call
[2330.04 --> 2330.48]  Outside
[2330.48 --> 2331.14]  Because of course
[2331.14 --> 2332.20]  Ava's in the back seat
[2332.20 --> 2334.64]  And we're just
[2334.64 --> 2335.46]  I'm trying to guard
[2335.46 --> 2335.88]  Her heart
[2335.88 --> 2336.34]  I don't know
[2336.34 --> 2337.04]  What the phone call
[2337.04 --> 2337.86]  Really is going to be
[2337.86 --> 2341.28]  So the social worker
[2341.28 --> 2343.32]  Is talking and talking
[2343.32 --> 2344.94]  And she's super long winded
[2344.94 --> 2346.58]  And after about
[2346.58 --> 2347.64]  15, 20 minutes
[2347.64 --> 2348.64]  I just say
[2348.64 --> 2349.68]  Okay
[2349.68 --> 2351.24]  Do I just say yes
[2351.24 --> 2352.66]  And this baby is ours
[2352.66 --> 2355.00]  And she was like
[2355.00 --> 2355.22]  Yeah
[2355.22 --> 2357.36]  So it was a very
[2357.36 --> 2358.18]  Unique situation
[2358.18 --> 2361.84]  She told me that
[2361.84 --> 2362.54]  There's a baby girl
[2362.54 --> 2363.04]  In Langley
[2363.04 --> 2364.14]  That was a month old
[2364.14 --> 2365.36]  She was currently
[2365.36 --> 2366.42]  With a foster family
[2366.42 --> 2368.26]  And we were able
[2368.26 --> 2368.84]  To meet her
[2368.84 --> 2369.80]  In just a few days
[2369.80 --> 2371.72]  So I said yes
[2371.72 --> 2372.90]  Before talking to Colin
[2372.90 --> 2375.52]  And then I got to tell
[2375.52 --> 2376.46]  Colin and Ava
[2376.46 --> 2378.78]  I went back in the car
[2378.78 --> 2379.36]  And looked at them
[2379.36 --> 2379.96]  And said there was
[2379.96 --> 2380.54]  A baby girl
[2380.54 --> 2381.92]  That needed a forever family
[2381.92 --> 2383.64]  And Ava leaned forward
[2383.64 --> 2384.08]  And said
[2384.08 --> 2385.18]  Can I be her sister
[2385.18 --> 2387.78]  And it was such an easy yes
[2387.78 --> 2389.96]  Because this day
[2389.96 --> 2392.10]  Nora was 31 days old
[2392.10 --> 2393.92]  And the revocation period
[2393.92 --> 2394.46]  Was over
[2394.46 --> 2396.52]  We wouldn't have to go
[2396.52 --> 2397.28]  Through that anxious
[2397.28 --> 2398.12]  Waiting period
[2398.12 --> 2399.42]  And we felt
[2399.42 --> 2400.28]  Absolutely free
[2400.28 --> 2401.62]  To just tell her everything
[2401.62 --> 2404.98]  Yeah so
[2404.98 --> 2406.78]  We got a phone message later
[2406.78 --> 2407.98]  So imagine
[2407.98 --> 2408.84]  Okay 12 o'clock
[2408.84 --> 2410.38]  We're at Caldus Lake
[2410.38 --> 2411.64]  We were like
[2411.64 --> 2412.88]  Hey this is the last family outing
[2412.88 --> 2413.52]  A family of three
[2413.52 --> 2415.32]  And then we last about an hour
[2415.32 --> 2416.04]  At the lake
[2416.04 --> 2416.70]  Let's just go home
[2416.70 --> 2417.38]  And figure this out
[2417.38 --> 2418.82]  And then we got a phone message
[2418.82 --> 2420.00]  At 4 o'clock that day
[2420.00 --> 2421.98]  So less than 4 hours later
[2421.98 --> 2426.64]  You know the choppy message
[2426.64 --> 2427.26]  And it was like
[2427.26 --> 2428.76]  All we could really hear
[2428.76 --> 2429.84]  Was changes happening
[2429.84 --> 2431.12]  And we're like
[2431.12 --> 2433.32]  Like we were thinking
[2433.32 --> 2434.48]  Like we just told Ava
[2434.48 --> 2435.08]  And like
[2435.08 --> 2435.76]  Oh like what are we
[2435.76 --> 2436.44]  Like what's happening
[2436.44 --> 2438.56]  So then
[2438.56 --> 2439.56]  And then she shot
[2439.56 --> 2440.14]  At the end of the message
[2440.14 --> 2441.08]  She said don't call back
[2441.08 --> 2442.20]  And we're like
[2442.20 --> 2442.84]  What?
[2443.46 --> 2443.74]  So
[2443.74 --> 2445.26]  We called back
[2445.26 --> 2445.80]  Too bad
[2445.80 --> 2447.74]  And
[2447.74 --> 2448.58]  I told her
[2448.58 --> 2449.28]  That's my spot here
[2449.28 --> 2450.22]  Sorry
[2450.22 --> 2453.68]  Yeah so then
[2453.68 --> 2454.30]  We finally got a hold of
[2454.30 --> 2455.60]  At 5 o'clock that day
[2455.60 --> 2457.18]  They asked if the baby girl
[2457.18 --> 2458.44]  Could be brought to our house
[2458.44 --> 2459.80]  At 7 p.m. that night
[2459.80 --> 2461.72]  And we're like
[2461.72 --> 2462.32]  Yeah
[2462.32 --> 2463.08]  Sure
[2463.08 --> 2463.54]  Like
[2463.54 --> 2464.80]  We have 2 hours warning
[2464.80 --> 2465.56]  We thought it was going to be
[2465.56 --> 2466.60]  3 or 4 days from now
[2466.60 --> 2469.50]  So 2 hours later
[2469.50 --> 2471.02]  2 social workers showed up
[2471.02 --> 2472.36]  The foster couple
[2472.36 --> 2473.94]  Carried this tiny baby
[2473.94 --> 2474.80]  Inside our home
[2474.80 --> 2476.24]  And passed her to Nicole
[2476.24 --> 2478.22]  They stayed a little while
[2478.22 --> 2478.78]  And told us that
[2478.78 --> 2479.36]  They've been praying
[2479.36 --> 2480.30]  For a Christian family
[2480.30 --> 2481.68]  For this baby girl
[2481.68 --> 2482.82]  The foster family
[2482.82 --> 2483.66]  Was this amazing
[2483.66 --> 2485.12]  Foster family
[2485.12 --> 2486.32]  Christian foster family
[2486.32 --> 2486.72]  In Langley
[2486.72 --> 2488.14]  Who only takes in
[2488.14 --> 2489.68]  Newborns
[2489.68 --> 2491.24]  It's amazing
[2491.24 --> 2491.92]  Amazing couple
[2491.92 --> 2493.64]  Ava held her next
[2493.64 --> 2494.56]  And in the coming weeks
[2494.56 --> 2495.14]  She would tell
[2495.14 --> 2496.16]  Everyone that would listen
[2496.16 --> 2497.66]  We connected right away
[2497.66 --> 2499.06]  Both girls
[2499.06 --> 2500.12]  Have a connection to India
[2500.12 --> 2502.10]  It's so amazing
[2502.10 --> 2502.90]  That they can share
[2502.90 --> 2504.30]  That heritage together
[2504.30 --> 2505.34]  And their birthdays
[2505.34 --> 2506.28]  Are one day apart
[2506.28 --> 2508.70]  So
[2508.70 --> 2510.18]  That's the fun part
[2510.18 --> 2510.76]  Of the story
[2510.76 --> 2512.08]  And
[2512.08 --> 2513.54]  To kind of tie it all up
[2513.54 --> 2514.96]  We just
[2514.96 --> 2516.04]  We trust
[2516.04 --> 2517.32]  In the process
[2517.32 --> 2518.04]  We trust in God
[2518.04 --> 2518.24]  That
[2518.24 --> 2519.40]  We just knew
[2519.40 --> 2519.88]  That our family
[2519.88 --> 2520.38]  Was complete
[2520.38 --> 2521.86]  It was like this
[2521.86 --> 2522.10]  Like
[2522.10 --> 2523.86]  Boa on the present
[2523.86 --> 2524.44]  It was just like
[2524.44 --> 2525.28]  We can move forward
[2525.28 --> 2527.62]  And we knew
[2527.62 --> 2528.58]  It all happened
[2528.58 --> 2528.96]  For a reason
[2528.96 --> 2529.62]  I know it sounds cliche
[2529.62 --> 2530.42]  But we knew
[2530.42 --> 2531.04]  It happened for a reason
[2531.04 --> 2532.64]  The Ryan saga
[2532.64 --> 2533.98]  Of our lives
[2533.98 --> 2534.98]  Happened for a reason
[2534.98 --> 2537.98]  I just want to say
[2537.98 --> 2538.42]  Thank you
[2538.42 --> 2539.46]  For being willing
[2539.46 --> 2540.38]  To share that story
[2540.38 --> 2541.54]  There's very hard
[2541.54 --> 2542.64]  Pieces in it
[2542.64 --> 2543.64]  And yet
[2543.64 --> 2544.98]  It's amazing to me
[2544.98 --> 2545.48]  The way you see
[2545.48 --> 2546.46]  God weaving it together
[2546.46 --> 2547.30]  And the first time
[2547.30 --> 2547.88]  You told me
[2547.88 --> 2548.86]  The summarized version
[2548.86 --> 2549.12]  You're like
[2549.12 --> 2549.64]  This is a story
[2549.64 --> 2550.44]  With God's fingerprints
[2550.44 --> 2551.20]  All over it
[2551.20 --> 2552.26]  And I praise the Lord
[2552.26 --> 2552.66]  For that
[2552.66 --> 2553.38]  I praise the Lord
[2553.38 --> 2553.80]  For the vision
[2553.80 --> 2554.22]  He gave you
[2554.22 --> 2554.80]  As a teenager
[2554.80 --> 2556.18]  To be an adoptive mom
[2556.18 --> 2557.62]  And just the way
[2557.62 --> 2558.76]  That you had this vision
[2558.76 --> 2559.36]  Together for growing
[2559.36 --> 2559.78]  Your family
[2559.78 --> 2560.30]  We're thankful
[2560.30 --> 2560.80]  That you're part
[2560.80 --> 2561.86]  Of our church family too
[2561.86 --> 2563.56]  They've generously
[2563.56 --> 2564.72]  Said to me
[2564.72 --> 2565.32]  They did this
[2565.32 --> 2566.00]  Between the services
[2566.00 --> 2567.56]  But they're willing
[2567.56 --> 2568.34]  To stick around the foyer
[2568.34 --> 2569.18]  If you've got questions
[2569.18 --> 2570.34]  You want to hear more
[2570.34 --> 2570.98]  About adoption
[2570.98 --> 2571.70]  You want to hear more
[2571.70 --> 2572.60]  About their story
[2572.60 --> 2573.74]  And just they can resource you
[2573.74 --> 2574.74]  The knowledge you have
[2574.74 --> 2575.28]  About adoption
[2575.28 --> 2576.16]  Is phenomenal
[2576.16 --> 2577.74]  So feel free to talk
[2577.74 --> 2578.46]  To them after the service
[2578.46 --> 2578.94]  In the foyer
[2578.94 --> 2579.92]  And they'll be a gift
[2579.92 --> 2580.78]  To our church that way
[2580.78 --> 2582.50]  Is it okay if I pray
[2582.50 --> 2582.88]  For you guys
[2582.88 --> 2583.54]  Before we sit down
[2583.54 --> 2586.82]  Father I thank you
[2586.82 --> 2587.76]  For Colin and Nicole
[2587.76 --> 2588.68]  I thank you
[2588.68 --> 2589.34]  For the way you brought
[2589.34 --> 2590.36]  Them into our church family
[2590.36 --> 2592.02]  And the vision
[2592.02 --> 2592.88]  You gave both of them
[2592.88 --> 2593.76]  At a young age
[2593.76 --> 2594.58]  To grow their family
[2594.58 --> 2595.18]  Through adoption
[2595.18 --> 2596.60]  To open their family
[2596.60 --> 2597.10]  To children
[2597.10 --> 2598.88]  And I praise you
[2598.88 --> 2600.28]  For the beautiful
[2600.28 --> 2601.54]  And even hard story
[2601.54 --> 2602.42]  Of bringing both
[2602.42 --> 2603.10]  Ava and Nora
[2603.10 --> 2603.88]  Into their family
[2603.88 --> 2605.24]  I pray that you
[2605.24 --> 2605.84]  Would bless them
[2605.84 --> 2606.44]  With strength
[2606.44 --> 2606.92]  And wisdom
[2606.92 --> 2607.70]  Patience
[2607.70 --> 2609.26]  Perseverance
[2609.26 --> 2610.08]  As they're in the
[2610.08 --> 2611.28]  Young baby stage still
[2611.28 --> 2612.46]  And I ask that you
[2612.46 --> 2613.44]  Bless their family
[2613.44 --> 2615.28]  Lord I pray for children
[2615.28 --> 2615.78]  Right now
[2615.78 --> 2616.84]  Who are looking for homes
[2616.84 --> 2618.48]  I pray for children
[2618.48 --> 2619.26]  In foster care
[2619.26 --> 2621.66]  I pray for foster families
[2621.66 --> 2622.84]  And those who are seeking
[2622.84 --> 2623.56]  To be families
[2623.56 --> 2624.26]  For those who are
[2624.26 --> 2625.06]  In a tough place
[2625.06 --> 2626.62]  I ask that your kingdom
[2626.62 --> 2627.82]  Would come in the places
[2627.82 --> 2628.70]  Of greatest need
[2628.70 --> 2629.82]  And we pray this
[2629.82 --> 2630.96]  In Jesus' mighty name
[2630.96 --> 2631.70]  Amen
[2631.70 --> 2634.12]  Thank you so much
[2634.12 --> 2646.78]  This time I'm going to
[2646.78 --> 2647.84]  Invite James Parkup
[2647.84 --> 2649.06]  To lead us in community prayer
[2649.06 --> 2651.26]  Not to make James nervous
[2651.26 --> 2652.40]  But he's one of the elders
[2652.40 --> 2652.84]  In our church
[2652.84 --> 2653.66]  This is his first time
[2653.66 --> 2654.44]  Leading community prayer
[2654.44 --> 2655.18]  And we're very grateful
[2655.18 --> 2657.80]  So
[2657.80 --> 2661.14]  Good morning
[2661.14 --> 2663.86]  Yeah my name is James Park
[2663.86 --> 2665.82]  And I'm one of the elders
[2665.82 --> 2668.04]  Hope and our family
[2668.04 --> 2669.04]  Has been coming to
[2669.04 --> 2669.84]  Hope Community Church
[2669.84 --> 2670.84]  For about three years
[2670.84 --> 2672.78]  And it's been a true blessing
[2672.78 --> 2675.68]  And this year
[2675.68 --> 2677.30]  It's been quite a journey
[2677.30 --> 2678.08]  For our family
[2678.08 --> 2679.68]  As some of you already know
[2679.68 --> 2680.76]  My wife Sarah
[2680.76 --> 2682.60]  Was diagnosed with breast cancer
[2682.60 --> 2684.82]  March this year
[2684.82 --> 2686.54]  And we've decided
[2686.54 --> 2687.60]  That she gets her treatment
[2687.60 --> 2688.26]  In Korea
[2688.26 --> 2689.86]  Where she can focus
[2689.86 --> 2690.74]  On her recovering
[2690.74 --> 2691.86]  And getting support
[2691.86 --> 2692.62]  From her family
[2692.62 --> 2694.66]  And we're very grateful
[2694.66 --> 2697.30]  That her treatment
[2697.30 --> 2698.70]  Is progressing well
[2698.70 --> 2700.76]  And my two girls
[2700.76 --> 2702.38]  Who are eight and five
[2702.38 --> 2703.94]  Are also doing great
[2703.94 --> 2705.62]  Despite their mom being away
[2705.62 --> 2707.60]  And yeah
[2707.60 --> 2708.22]  I just want to say
[2708.22 --> 2708.92]  Thank you
[2708.92 --> 2709.88]  How much we appreciate
[2709.88 --> 2710.74]  All the prayers
[2710.74 --> 2712.28]  And support from Hope
[2712.28 --> 2714.38]  And actually
[2714.38 --> 2715.80]  She's going through
[2715.80 --> 2717.60]  Her last chemo session
[2717.60 --> 2718.68]  Today in Korea
[2718.68 --> 2720.60]  In about 10 hours
[2720.60 --> 2725.60]  And her surgery
[2725.60 --> 2726.18]  Is scheduled
[2726.18 --> 2727.62]  For November 8th
[2727.62 --> 2728.60]  So please continue
[2728.60 --> 2729.34]  To pray for her
[2729.34 --> 2730.12]  And our family
[2730.12 --> 2731.62]  So that she can come home soon
[2731.62 --> 2733.72]  So now
[2733.72 --> 2734.50]  Please join me
[2734.50 --> 2735.62]  For the community prayer
[2735.62 --> 2741.60]  Dear Heavenly Father
[2741.60 --> 2742.80]  As we gather
[2742.80 --> 2744.14]  As a community this Sunday
[2744.14 --> 2745.48]  Our hearts overflow
[2745.48 --> 2746.24]  With gratitude
[2746.24 --> 2747.18]  For the blessings
[2747.18 --> 2748.66]  You've bestowed upon us
[2748.66 --> 2749.56]  This past week
[2749.56 --> 2750.92]  We thank you
[2750.92 --> 2751.88]  For this new day
[2751.88 --> 2753.02]  For the chance
[2753.02 --> 2753.96]  To join together
[2753.96 --> 2754.60]  In worship
[2754.60 --> 2755.74]  And for the bonds
[2755.74 --> 2756.32]  Of fellowship
[2756.32 --> 2757.24]  That unite us
[2757.24 --> 2758.46]  Lord
[2758.46 --> 2760.06]  We lift our voices
[2760.06 --> 2760.70]  In praise
[2760.70 --> 2762.80]  Recognizing your boundless love
[2762.80 --> 2764.24]  And unwavering presence
[2764.24 --> 2765.10]  In our lives
[2765.10 --> 2766.82]  It is through your grace
[2766.82 --> 2768.00]  That we find purpose
[2768.00 --> 2768.60]  And shalom
[2768.60 --> 2770.14]  Today
[2770.14 --> 2771.28]  We pray for the
[2771.28 --> 2772.54]  Regions of our world
[2772.54 --> 2773.12]  Torn apart
[2773.12 --> 2773.96]  By conflict
[2773.96 --> 2774.56]  And war
[2774.56 --> 2776.46]  We ask for intervention
[2776.46 --> 2777.18]  Jesus
[2777.18 --> 2778.78]  You are the prince of peace
[2778.78 --> 2780.10]  Grant wisdom
[2780.10 --> 2780.70]  To leaders
[2780.70 --> 2781.96]  That they may seek
[2781.96 --> 2782.50]  Resolutions
[2782.50 --> 2783.38]  That bring about
[2783.38 --> 2784.06]  Reconciliation
[2784.06 --> 2784.76]  And healing
[2784.76 --> 2786.54]  Soften the hearts
[2786.54 --> 2787.44]  Of those involved
[2787.44 --> 2788.74]  Replacing animosity
[2788.74 --> 2789.84]  With understanding
[2789.84 --> 2790.56]  And hatred
[2790.56 --> 2791.22]  With love
[2791.22 --> 2793.14]  Provide comfort
[2793.14 --> 2793.84]  And hope
[2793.84 --> 2794.62]  To those affected
[2794.62 --> 2795.22]  By war
[2795.22 --> 2796.44]  Letting them feel
[2796.44 --> 2797.68]  Your abiding love
[2797.68 --> 2799.66]  We also ask
[2799.66 --> 2801.66]  For your comforting presence
[2801.66 --> 2802.88]  For those among us
[2802.88 --> 2803.76]  Dealing with illness
[2803.76 --> 2804.44]  And challenges
[2804.44 --> 2805.82]  We lift up
[2805.82 --> 2806.44]  Kate and Lunin
[2806.44 --> 2808.40]  Praying for a swift recovery
[2808.40 --> 2809.70]  From last week's surgery
[2809.70 --> 2810.94]  We also remember
[2810.94 --> 2811.48]  Sarah Choi
[2811.48 --> 2812.34]  As she undergoes
[2812.34 --> 2813.38]  Her final chemo session
[2813.38 --> 2814.12]  Today in Korea
[2814.12 --> 2815.74]  Please continue
[2815.74 --> 2816.44]  To be with them
[2816.44 --> 2817.22]  On this journey
[2817.22 --> 2818.72]  Grant them strength
[2818.72 --> 2819.44]  Resilience
[2819.44 --> 2820.28]  And assurance
[2820.28 --> 2820.36]  And assurance
[2820.36 --> 2821.52]  Of your abiding care
[2821.52 --> 2822.82]  Lord
[2822.82 --> 2824.34]  Anoint Pastor Dave
[2824.34 --> 2825.34]  With your spirit
[2825.34 --> 2827.00]  As we listen
[2827.00 --> 2827.54]  To your message
[2827.54 --> 2828.76]  Today about finances
[2828.76 --> 2830.08]  May it resonate
[2830.08 --> 2831.24]  Deeply within us
[2831.24 --> 2832.22]  Leading to a deeper
[2832.22 --> 2833.46]  Grasp of your principles
[2833.46 --> 2835.06]  Of handling the resources
[2835.06 --> 2835.86]  You provide
[2835.86 --> 2836.92]  In Jesus
[2836.92 --> 2837.92]  In Jesus
[2837.92 --> 2838.16]  All my name we pray
[2838.16 --> 2839.02]  Amen
[2839.02 --> 2841.80]  And after the service
[2841.80 --> 2843.02]  I'll be available
[2843.02 --> 2844.70]  On that side of the corner
[2844.70 --> 2846.78]  If anybody needs prayer
[2846.78 --> 2847.92]  Just come and find me
[2847.92 --> 2848.86]  Then we'll pray
[2848.86 --> 2849.92]  Together for you
[2849.92 --> 2863.20]  Well we are going to continue
[2863.20 --> 2864.24]  Our sermon series
[2864.24 --> 2865.60]  Called Homegrown
[2865.60 --> 2867.86]  And really in a nutshell
[2867.86 --> 2868.96]  What we've been trying to do
[2868.96 --> 2869.98]  Over the last number of weeks
[2869.98 --> 2871.00]  Is reflect on
[2871.00 --> 2871.68]  What does it look like
[2871.68 --> 2872.42]  If we seek first
[2872.42 --> 2873.46]  The kingdom in our home
[2873.46 --> 2874.72]  What's it look like
[2874.72 --> 2875.40]  When we seek first
[2875.40 --> 2876.40]  The kingdom in our marriages
[2876.40 --> 2877.82]  When we seek first
[2877.82 --> 2878.98]  The kingdom in our parenting
[2878.98 --> 2880.32]  When we seek first
[2880.32 --> 2880.86]  God's kingdom
[2880.86 --> 2882.00]  In our hospitality
[2882.00 --> 2882.82]  And this morning
[2882.82 --> 2883.60]  We're looking at
[2883.60 --> 2884.50]  What would it look like
[2884.50 --> 2885.28]  For us to seek first
[2885.28 --> 2886.16]  The kingdom of God
[2886.16 --> 2887.60]  With our finances
[2887.60 --> 2888.90]  With our money
[2888.90 --> 2889.66]  And if you're visiting
[2889.66 --> 2890.26]  I just want you to know
[2890.26 --> 2890.98]  We don't preach on money
[2890.98 --> 2891.48]  Every week
[2891.48 --> 2892.32]  It's like the stereotype
[2892.32 --> 2892.94]  Of the church
[2892.94 --> 2894.02]  But we are preaching
[2894.02 --> 2894.62]  On it today
[2894.62 --> 2896.30]  If you have your Bible
[2896.30 --> 2897.06]  Turn with me to
[2897.06 --> 2897.72]  1 Timothy
[2897.72 --> 2898.78]  We're going to read
[2898.78 --> 2899.36]  Two sections
[2899.36 --> 2900.50]  From chapter 6
[2900.50 --> 2906.80]  Starting with verse 6
[2906.80 --> 2909.46]  But godliness
[2909.46 --> 2910.56]  With contentment
[2910.56 --> 2912.02]  Is great gain
[2912.02 --> 2913.92]  For we brought nothing
[2913.92 --> 2914.72]  Into the world
[2914.72 --> 2915.58]  And we can take
[2915.58 --> 2916.92]  Nothing out of it
[2916.92 --> 2918.34]  But if we have food
[2918.34 --> 2918.80]  And clothing
[2918.80 --> 2919.56]  We will be content
[2919.56 --> 2920.04]  With that
[2920.04 --> 2921.78]  Those who want to get rich
[2921.78 --> 2922.84]  Fall into temptation
[2922.84 --> 2923.72]  And a trap
[2923.72 --> 2925.14]  And to many foolish
[2925.14 --> 2926.08]  And harmful desires
[2926.08 --> 2927.12]  That plunge people
[2927.12 --> 2928.64]  Into ruin and destruction
[2928.64 --> 2930.60]  For the love of money
[2930.60 --> 2931.18]  Is a root
[2931.18 --> 2932.98]  Of all kinds of evil
[2932.98 --> 2935.20]  Some people eager for money
[2935.20 --> 2936.54]  Have wandered from the faith
[2936.54 --> 2937.98]  And pierced themselves
[2937.98 --> 2939.86]  With many griefs
[2939.86 --> 2941.88]  Command those who are rich
[2941.88 --> 2942.88]  In this present world
[2942.88 --> 2944.04]  Not to be arrogant
[2944.04 --> 2945.46]  Nor to put their hope
[2945.46 --> 2945.92]  In wealth
[2945.92 --> 2947.16]  Which is so uncertain
[2947.16 --> 2948.58]  But to put their hope
[2948.58 --> 2949.10]  In God
[2949.10 --> 2950.76]  Who richly provides us
[2950.76 --> 2951.52]  With everything
[2951.52 --> 2953.02]  For our enjoyment
[2953.02 --> 2955.02]  Command them to do good
[2955.02 --> 2956.54]  To be rich in good deeds
[2956.54 --> 2957.28]  And to be generous
[2957.28 --> 2958.36]  And willing to share
[2958.36 --> 2959.64]  In this way
[2959.64 --> 2960.78]  They will lay up treasure
[2960.78 --> 2961.46]  For themselves
[2961.46 --> 2962.86]  As a firm foundation
[2962.86 --> 2964.26]  For the coming age
[2964.26 --> 2965.64]  So that they may take hold
[2965.64 --> 2966.18]  Of life
[2966.18 --> 2967.56]  That is truly
[2967.56 --> 2968.68]  Life
[2968.68 --> 2974.12]  Well one of the things
[2974.12 --> 2974.68]  That Brittany
[2974.68 --> 2975.50]  My wife and I
[2975.50 --> 2976.76]  Enjoy doing together
[2976.76 --> 2977.40]  In ministry
[2977.40 --> 2978.80]  Is pre-marriage counseling
[2978.80 --> 2979.32]  With couples
[2979.32 --> 2980.12]  Who are preparing
[2980.12 --> 2981.04]  For marriage
[2981.04 --> 2982.74]  And we sit down
[2982.74 --> 2983.08]  With them
[2983.08 --> 2983.98]  And we get to know them
[2983.98 --> 2984.56]  And one of the things
[2984.56 --> 2985.42]  That we make sure
[2985.42 --> 2986.58]  We really talk about
[2986.58 --> 2987.82]  Is money
[2987.82 --> 2989.88]  And the reason we do that
[2989.88 --> 2990.66]  Is probably threefold
[2990.66 --> 2991.22]  One is
[2991.22 --> 2991.98]  Couples are often
[2991.98 --> 2992.62]  Very terrible
[2992.62 --> 2993.74]  At talking about finances
[2993.74 --> 2994.46]  It's awkward
[2994.46 --> 2995.42]  Sometimes it feels
[2995.42 --> 2996.06]  A bit shameful
[2996.06 --> 2996.76]  To say how much
[2996.76 --> 2997.64]  Or you don't have
[2997.64 --> 2998.56]  Or what you do have
[2998.56 --> 2999.86]  I'm told
[2999.86 --> 3001.12]  And had confirmed this week
[3001.12 --> 3001.96]  That conflict
[3001.96 --> 3003.28]  Over a lot of things
[3003.28 --> 3004.36]  Orients around money
[3004.36 --> 3005.56]  In fact money is cited
[3005.56 --> 3006.22]  As one of the two
[3006.22 --> 3007.24]  Most common sources
[3007.24 --> 3008.40]  Of divorce
[3008.40 --> 3010.38]  I corroborated that
[3010.38 --> 3011.18]  This week by the way
[3011.18 --> 3011.80]  When I was talking
[3011.80 --> 3012.36]  To my brother
[3012.36 --> 3013.54]  Who's a marriage counselor
[3013.54 --> 3013.98]  And I said
[3013.98 --> 3014.78]  Is it true that
[3014.78 --> 3015.20]  You know
[3015.20 --> 3016.38]  So many marriages
[3016.38 --> 3017.72]  The source of conflict
[3017.72 --> 3018.40]  Is finances
[3018.40 --> 3019.60]  How much does it come up
[3019.60 --> 3020.50]  And my brother
[3020.50 --> 3021.32]  Just said to me
[3021.32 --> 3023.78]  All the time
[3023.78 --> 3025.24]  And even if money
[3025.24 --> 3026.00]  Isn't the source
[3026.00 --> 3026.58]  Of the conflict
[3026.58 --> 3027.92]  It's always attached to it
[3027.92 --> 3028.94]  Because spending habits
[3028.94 --> 3030.00]  Or things you don't
[3030.00 --> 3031.06]  Spend money on
[3031.06 --> 3032.44]  Reveal where you're at
[3032.44 --> 3033.80]  Or reveal what you love
[3033.80 --> 3035.18]  And regardless of
[3035.18 --> 3035.78]  Whether you know it
[3035.78 --> 3036.30]  Or not
[3036.30 --> 3037.40]  Your money
[3037.40 --> 3038.42]  And how you use it
[3038.42 --> 3039.48]  In your home
[3039.48 --> 3041.32]  Says a lot about you
[3041.32 --> 3043.42]  Says a lot about your loves
[3043.42 --> 3045.34]  Says a lot about your desires
[3045.34 --> 3047.02]  And so when we mapped up
[3047.02 --> 3047.80]  The sermon series
[3047.80 --> 3048.30]  We just said
[3048.30 --> 3048.98]  Okay we're going to do
[3048.98 --> 3050.00]  At least one Sunday
[3050.00 --> 3051.90]  On how do we manage
[3051.90 --> 3052.66]  And steward
[3052.66 --> 3053.64]  The money
[3053.64 --> 3054.72]  That God gives
[3054.72 --> 3055.38]  Our home
[3055.38 --> 3057.70]  Not only does the Bible
[3057.70 --> 3058.76]  Have a lot to say
[3058.76 --> 3059.26]  About money
[3059.26 --> 3060.48]  In this passage in particular
[3060.48 --> 3061.90]  But we happen to live
[3061.90 --> 3062.42]  In a time
[3062.42 --> 3063.64]  And in a culture
[3063.64 --> 3065.20]  Where it's crucial
[3065.20 --> 3066.06]  To think about
[3066.06 --> 3066.70]  As believers
[3066.70 --> 3067.66]  How we manage our money
[3067.66 --> 3068.80]  Because we live in a culture
[3068.80 --> 3070.26]  That is obsessed
[3070.26 --> 3071.98]  And preoccupied
[3071.98 --> 3073.10]  With the accumulation
[3073.10 --> 3074.40]  And the consumption
[3074.40 --> 3075.40]  Of money
[3075.40 --> 3078.22]  So Paul talks a lot
[3078.22 --> 3079.46]  About money in this passage
[3079.46 --> 3080.94]  He cares a lot
[3080.94 --> 3081.84]  About money in this passage
[3081.84 --> 3082.70]  Because it matters
[3082.70 --> 3083.98]  And just imagine
[3083.98 --> 3084.96]  In Paul's situation
[3084.96 --> 3086.58]  He's very aware
[3086.58 --> 3087.28]  That in the cities
[3087.28 --> 3087.98]  That he goes to
[3087.98 --> 3089.36]  There's extreme differences
[3089.36 --> 3090.42]  Of wealth and poverty
[3090.42 --> 3091.10]  Just like today
[3091.10 --> 3092.44]  Even in the church
[3092.44 --> 3093.08]  You should know
[3093.08 --> 3093.70]  That if you read
[3093.70 --> 3094.56]  Ephesians 5
[3094.56 --> 3095.38]  And then 6
[3095.38 --> 3096.68]  Two groups of people
[3096.68 --> 3097.68]  That Paul addresses
[3097.68 --> 3098.92]  Before he talks about
[3098.92 --> 3099.84]  Those who have money
[3099.84 --> 3101.44]  Are the widows
[3101.44 --> 3102.64]  And the slaves
[3102.64 --> 3104.32]  And so you can imagine
[3104.32 --> 3105.34]  The pastoral burden
[3105.34 --> 3106.16]  Paul feels
[3106.16 --> 3107.66]  For the widows and slaves
[3107.66 --> 3108.32]  Both of whom
[3108.32 --> 3108.96]  Would be very
[3108.96 --> 3109.96]  Economically challenged
[3109.96 --> 3111.04]  And now he's got to
[3111.04 --> 3111.56]  Talk to those
[3111.56 --> 3111.94]  In the church
[3111.94 --> 3112.40]  Who have money
[3112.40 --> 3112.94]  Well what is he
[3112.94 --> 3113.72]  Going to say to them
[3113.72 --> 3114.96]  What's his word
[3114.96 --> 3116.22]  To those who have wealth
[3116.22 --> 3116.84]  And this is what
[3116.84 --> 3117.32]  It's going to be
[3117.32 --> 3117.82]  You're going to see
[3117.82 --> 3118.48]  This this morning
[3118.48 --> 3119.76]  It really is a
[3119.76 --> 3121.52]  Fourfold invitation
[3121.52 --> 3122.78]  Command really
[3122.78 --> 3123.92]  To the way of Jesus
[3123.92 --> 3125.62]  The four dimensions
[3125.62 --> 3126.26]  Of finances
[3126.26 --> 3127.20]  That Paul talks about
[3127.20 --> 3127.90]  Are simplicity
[3127.90 --> 3130.06]  Gratitude
[3130.06 --> 3131.82]  Contentment
[3131.82 --> 3133.50]  And generosity
[3133.50 --> 3134.72]  We're going to unpack
[3134.72 --> 3135.52]  All four of those
[3135.52 --> 3136.46]  In this passage
[3136.46 --> 3137.88]  So let's take a look
[3137.88 --> 3138.70]  At how Paul starts
[3138.70 --> 3139.40]  In verse 6
[3139.40 --> 3140.80]  We'll read again
[3140.80 --> 3141.88]  But godliness
[3141.88 --> 3143.08]  With contentment
[3143.08 --> 3143.92]  There's that word
[3143.92 --> 3144.96]  Is great gain
[3144.96 --> 3146.48]  For we brought nothing
[3146.48 --> 3147.00]  Into the world
[3147.00 --> 3147.64]  And we can take
[3147.64 --> 3148.40]  Nothing out of it
[3148.40 --> 3149.64]  Or to quote my grandpa
[3149.64 --> 3150.92]  He always says
[3150.92 --> 3152.36]  You'll never see a hearse
[3152.36 --> 3153.92]  Towing a U-Haul trailer
[3153.92 --> 3155.40]  You get it?
[3156.04 --> 3157.28]  You can take nothing
[3157.28 --> 3157.96]  Out of this world
[3157.96 --> 3158.26]  With you
[3158.26 --> 3158.94]  You might amass
[3158.94 --> 3159.72]  A lot of stuff
[3159.72 --> 3160.08]  In it
[3160.08 --> 3160.66]  But it's not
[3160.66 --> 3161.24]  Coming with you
[3161.24 --> 3162.00]  Whether you like it
[3162.00 --> 3162.58]  Or not
[3162.58 --> 3163.96]  Then he continues
[3163.96 --> 3164.70]  But if you have
[3164.70 --> 3165.40]  Food and clothing
[3165.40 --> 3166.90]  Be content with that
[3166.90 --> 3168.18]  Those who want
[3168.18 --> 3168.82]  To get rich
[3168.82 --> 3170.12]  Fall into temptation
[3170.12 --> 3171.02]  And a trap
[3171.02 --> 3172.66]  And to many foolish
[3172.66 --> 3173.56]  And harmful desires
[3173.56 --> 3174.54]  That plunge people
[3174.54 --> 3175.10]  Into ruin
[3175.10 --> 3176.04]  And destruction
[3176.04 --> 3177.86]  For the love of money
[3177.86 --> 3178.40]  Is a root
[3178.40 --> 3179.60]  Of all kinds of evil
[3179.60 --> 3181.00]  Some people
[3181.00 --> 3182.24]  Eager for money
[3182.24 --> 3183.26]  Have wandered
[3183.26 --> 3184.12]  From the faith
[3184.12 --> 3186.02]  And pierced themselves
[3186.02 --> 3187.22]  With many griefs
[3187.22 --> 3187.98]  And I bet
[3187.98 --> 3188.84]  That last line
[3188.84 --> 3190.04]  You know stories
[3190.04 --> 3191.06]  That illustrate the point
[3191.06 --> 3192.88]  Maybe you've experienced
[3192.88 --> 3194.22]  What it looks like
[3194.22 --> 3195.16]  To chase after money
[3195.16 --> 3196.42]  And pierce yourself
[3196.42 --> 3197.60]  With many griefs
[3197.60 --> 3199.46]  Now the first thing
[3199.46 --> 3200.04]  To note that Paul
[3200.04 --> 3201.12]  Mentioned is contentment
[3201.12 --> 3202.46]  Now contentment
[3202.46 --> 3203.32]  It needs to be named
[3203.32 --> 3205.22]  Is not directly attached
[3205.22 --> 3206.02]  To your income
[3206.02 --> 3206.76]  Do you know this?
[3207.78 --> 3208.56]  Contentment is not
[3208.56 --> 3209.66]  Necessarily contingent
[3209.66 --> 3210.10]  On your income
[3210.10 --> 3211.40]  We know many wealthy people
[3211.40 --> 3212.22]  Or you might know
[3212.22 --> 3213.06]  Many wealthy people
[3213.06 --> 3214.48]  Who are not content
[3214.48 --> 3215.80]  And you might know
[3215.80 --> 3216.98]  Very poor people
[3216.98 --> 3217.84]  Culturally speaking
[3217.84 --> 3218.74]  Who are very content
[3218.74 --> 3220.68]  I'm struck by an interview
[3220.68 --> 3221.48]  That was once done
[3221.48 --> 3223.14]  With a fortune 500 CEO
[3223.14 --> 3224.52]  And it was televised
[3224.52 --> 3225.14]  And the interviewer
[3225.14 --> 3226.10]  Just said to this guy
[3226.10 --> 3227.32]  How much money
[3227.32 --> 3228.54]  Do you need to be happy?
[3228.64 --> 3229.36]  And you know what he answered?
[3230.22 --> 3231.52]  Just a little bit more
[3231.52 --> 3233.30]  And in that statement
[3233.30 --> 3233.96]  He summarized
[3233.96 --> 3236.06]  What so many western people feel
[3236.06 --> 3237.44]  I'll be content
[3237.44 --> 3239.02]  If I get this
[3239.02 --> 3240.52]  I'll be satisfied
[3240.52 --> 3241.42]  If I just get
[3241.42 --> 3242.72]  A little bit more
[3242.72 --> 3243.28]  But money
[3243.28 --> 3244.94]  Is not what makes us content
[3244.94 --> 3246.72]  Contentment is attached
[3246.72 --> 3247.46]  To our relationship
[3247.46 --> 3248.34]  With the living God
[3248.34 --> 3249.72]  Throughout the scriptures
[3249.72 --> 3250.70]  Those who are content
[3250.70 --> 3252.10]  Are those who know
[3252.10 --> 3253.98]  That there really is
[3253.98 --> 3254.80]  A heavenly father
[3254.80 --> 3256.66]  Who is deeply concerned
[3256.66 --> 3257.40]  About his world
[3257.40 --> 3258.10]  And his children
[3258.10 --> 3259.66]  And will provide
[3259.66 --> 3261.68]  Just like a loving father
[3261.68 --> 3263.04]  Provides for his children
[3263.04 --> 3264.78]  And once you know that
[3264.78 --> 3265.88]  It changes your relationship
[3265.88 --> 3266.34]  To money
[3266.34 --> 3268.26]  And the issue
[3268.26 --> 3269.44]  That I think we need to name
[3269.44 --> 3271.42]  For us as western people
[3271.42 --> 3273.34]  Is that we functionally
[3273.34 --> 3274.50]  Live like atheists
[3274.50 --> 3276.62]  We don't manage our money
[3276.62 --> 3277.38]  Like there's a God
[3277.38 --> 3278.18]  Who's taking care of us
[3278.18 --> 3279.56]  We don't think about our money
[3279.56 --> 3280.98]  We don't imagine our finances
[3280.98 --> 3281.98]  In terms of God
[3281.98 --> 3282.76]  Giving these gifts
[3282.76 --> 3283.52]  For us to receive
[3283.52 --> 3284.32]  And God providing
[3284.32 --> 3284.94]  For our families
[3284.94 --> 3286.06]  For these various reasons
[3286.06 --> 3287.02]  We sort of see it
[3287.02 --> 3287.84]  All up to us
[3287.84 --> 3289.68]  We're in charge of the show
[3289.68 --> 3291.44]  We direct how things
[3291.44 --> 3292.16]  Are to be done
[3292.16 --> 3293.28]  With our finances
[3293.28 --> 3296.78]  Now Paul is acutely aware
[3296.78 --> 3298.50]  Of the risks
[3298.50 --> 3299.60]  And the pitfalls
[3299.60 --> 3300.56]  Of money
[3300.56 --> 3302.32]  He's aware that money
[3302.32 --> 3303.86]  Is a tool that so quickly
[3303.86 --> 3304.88]  Becomes an idol
[3304.88 --> 3306.32]  And it is not
[3306.32 --> 3307.22]  It's important to differentiate
[3307.22 --> 3307.88]  In this passage
[3307.88 --> 3309.66]  Money is not the root
[3309.66 --> 3310.66]  Of all kinds of evil
[3310.66 --> 3313.30]  It's the love of money
[3313.30 --> 3314.46]  It's when it moves
[3314.46 --> 3315.60]  From a tool to an idol
[3315.60 --> 3316.74]  When it moves from something
[3316.74 --> 3317.36]  That can bless
[3317.36 --> 3318.16]  To something that gives you
[3318.16 --> 3319.34]  Identity, satisfaction
[3319.34 --> 3320.68]  Meaning, and purpose
[3320.68 --> 3322.20]  And man does it move
[3322.20 --> 3323.98]  In that direction quickly
[3323.98 --> 3326.86]  As soon as you start chasing money
[3326.86 --> 3328.24]  And it becomes the purpose
[3328.24 --> 3328.98]  Of your life
[3328.98 --> 3330.42]  You start seeing a wave
[3330.42 --> 3331.42]  Of destruction come into
[3331.42 --> 3332.18]  Your workplace
[3332.18 --> 3333.36]  Your family
[3333.36 --> 3334.56]  Your marriage
[3334.56 --> 3336.00]  And much, much more
[3336.00 --> 3338.40]  You know, if I had to pick
[3338.40 --> 3340.00]  One of the top western idols
[3340.00 --> 3341.52]  I'd say it's money
[3341.52 --> 3342.50]  Would you say that?
[3343.22 --> 3345.02]  Like, we worship money
[3345.02 --> 3346.40]  N.T. Wright
[3346.40 --> 3347.42]  One of the biblical scholars
[3347.42 --> 3348.66]  I love and read a lot
[3348.66 --> 3349.14]  He says, you know
[3349.14 --> 3349.74]  The only difference
[3349.74 --> 3351.04]  Between ancient civilizations
[3351.04 --> 3352.56]  And modern civilization
[3352.56 --> 3354.24]  Is they gave fancy names
[3354.24 --> 3355.10]  To their gods
[3355.10 --> 3356.04]  You know
[3356.04 --> 3357.36]  We just call our
[3357.36 --> 3358.46]  Our gods are money
[3358.46 --> 3361.50]  Sex, power, prestige
[3361.50 --> 3362.32]  It just is
[3362.32 --> 3363.30]  And we worship money
[3363.30 --> 3364.34]  You know, we mentioned
[3364.34 --> 3364.90]  A few weeks ago
[3364.90 --> 3365.84]  That the tallest buildings
[3365.84 --> 3366.46]  In our cities
[3366.46 --> 3367.50]  Are banks
[3367.50 --> 3368.74]  Our architecture
[3368.74 --> 3369.86]  Sort of glorifies
[3369.86 --> 3371.70]  And exalts finances
[3371.70 --> 3374.78]  Greed is an acceptable vice
[3374.78 --> 3375.82]  In western society
[3375.82 --> 3376.64]  Workaholism
[3376.64 --> 3377.86]  Is totally understandable
[3377.86 --> 3378.92]  Because it gets you what?
[3379.56 --> 3380.20]  Gets you money
[3380.20 --> 3382.22]  Five weeks ago
[3382.22 --> 3382.86]  When we were preaching
[3382.86 --> 3383.92]  On the biblical story
[3383.92 --> 3384.58]  And talking about
[3384.58 --> 3385.48]  The cultural story
[3385.48 --> 3386.58]  We sort of said
[3386.58 --> 3387.24]  Like, people
[3387.24 --> 3388.20]  Not even Christians
[3388.20 --> 3388.94]  Can summarize
[3388.94 --> 3390.04]  The western story
[3390.04 --> 3390.98]  In this way
[3390.98 --> 3392.56]  When you're a kid
[3392.56 --> 3393.48]  You go to school
[3393.48 --> 3394.38]  So what?
[3394.50 --> 3395.18]  What's the next part?
[3396.06 --> 3397.14]  So you get a good job
[3397.14 --> 3398.60]  So you
[3398.60 --> 3401.20]  Make lots of money
[3401.20 --> 3402.66]  And then you can retire
[3402.66 --> 3403.50]  And not work
[3403.50 --> 3404.30]  And enjoy
[3404.30 --> 3405.54]  Your consumer lifestyle
[3405.54 --> 3406.52]  That's sort of
[3406.52 --> 3407.74]  The dumbed down
[3407.74 --> 3408.90]  Simplified story
[3408.90 --> 3409.96]  Of western culture
[3409.96 --> 3410.62]  Get a good job
[3410.62 --> 3411.32]  Make lots of money
[3411.32 --> 3412.22]  So that you don't
[3412.22 --> 3412.94]  Have to work
[3412.94 --> 3413.84]  And can enjoy
[3413.84 --> 3414.42]  Your retirement
[3414.42 --> 3415.42]  With wealth
[3415.42 --> 3418.10]  What I've noticed lately
[3418.10 --> 3419.48]  At least since COVID
[3419.48 --> 3420.72]  Is that not only
[3420.72 --> 3421.22]  Are we a culture
[3421.22 --> 3422.28]  That's obsessed with money
[3422.28 --> 3424.20]  But we want money fast
[3424.20 --> 3425.82]  And maybe you remember this
[3425.82 --> 3426.36]  Over COVID
[3426.36 --> 3426.88]  All of a sudden
[3426.88 --> 3428.48]  Like stock investing
[3428.48 --> 3429.64]  Skyrocketed
[3429.64 --> 3431.60]  Online gambling skyrocketed
[3431.60 --> 3432.48]  In-person gambling
[3432.48 --> 3433.72]  Even became very popular
[3433.72 --> 3435.10]  Bitcoin just went
[3435.10 --> 3435.74]  Through the roof
[3435.74 --> 3437.06]  All these ways
[3437.06 --> 3438.10]  Of making not just money
[3438.10 --> 3439.88]  But fast money
[3439.88 --> 3440.76]  You don't have to
[3440.76 --> 3441.60]  Really work for it
[3441.60 --> 3441.88]  You just have to
[3441.88 --> 3442.36]  Take a risk
[3442.36 --> 3443.38]  And click a button here
[3443.38 --> 3444.44]  And that's a lure
[3444.44 --> 3445.50]  In fact
[3445.50 --> 3446.88]  I heard a few sales pitches
[3446.88 --> 3447.78]  Over the last few years
[3447.78 --> 3448.94]  And if I'm honest with you
[3448.94 --> 3450.42]  Some from extended family
[3450.42 --> 3450.94]  And friends
[3450.94 --> 3451.70]  You know
[3451.70 --> 3452.34]  I'll hear it
[3452.34 --> 3452.56]  I'm like
[3452.56 --> 3453.18]  Ah no
[3453.18 --> 3454.12]  That's a terrible idea
[3454.12 --> 3454.76]  But when I get home
[3454.76 --> 3455.16]  I'm like
[3455.16 --> 3456.42]  It's tempting
[3456.42 --> 3457.72]  That Bitcoin
[3457.72 --> 3459.32]  One of the people
[3459.32 --> 3460.40]  Who told me about Bitcoin
[3460.40 --> 3461.40]  And tried to sell me on it
[3461.40 --> 3462.32]  Said that the slogan
[3462.32 --> 3462.96]  For Bitcoin
[3462.96 --> 3463.48]  Get this
[3463.48 --> 3465.34]  Is come for the greed
[3465.34 --> 3467.14]  Stay for the revolution
[3467.14 --> 3467.92]  You heard that
[3467.92 --> 3469.18]  And something about
[3469.18 --> 3470.16]  Having that sales pitch
[3470.16 --> 3470.44]  To me
[3470.44 --> 3470.70]  I was like
[3470.70 --> 3471.18]  I don't know
[3471.18 --> 3471.88]  If I can get on board
[3471.88 --> 3472.32]  With something
[3472.32 --> 3473.00]  Where you have to
[3473.00 --> 3474.00]  Come for the greed
[3474.00 --> 3475.34]  Just doesn't sit well
[3475.34 --> 3475.78]  With me
[3475.78 --> 3477.22]  Wasn't a good sales pitch
[3477.22 --> 3477.88]  To a pastor
[3477.88 --> 3480.06]  But then Paul continues
[3480.06 --> 3480.94]  In verse 17
[3480.94 --> 3481.82]  To talk about
[3481.82 --> 3483.56]  Two very relevant dangers
[3483.56 --> 3485.52]  Even today
[3485.52 --> 3486.22]  It's almost like
[3486.22 --> 3486.78]  He's writing to the
[3486.78 --> 3487.38]  Western church
[3487.38 --> 3487.78]  He writes
[3487.78 --> 3489.12]  Command those who are rich
[3489.12 --> 3490.18]  In this present world
[3490.18 --> 3491.44]  Not to be arrogant
[3491.44 --> 3492.80]  Or put their hope
[3492.80 --> 3493.40]  In wealth
[3493.40 --> 3494.56]  Which is so uncertain
[3494.56 --> 3496.16]  Point number one
[3496.16 --> 3497.92]  Money makes you proud
[3497.92 --> 3499.70]  It makes you arrogant
[3499.70 --> 3501.30]  The thing about money
[3501.30 --> 3502.30]  Is it kind of gets you
[3502.30 --> 3502.90]  What you want
[3502.90 --> 3503.12]  Right
[3503.12 --> 3503.92]  The bigger home
[3503.92 --> 3504.74]  More travel
[3504.74 --> 3505.98]  The things that other people
[3505.98 --> 3506.46]  Can't have
[3506.46 --> 3507.08]  If you've got money
[3507.08 --> 3507.90]  You get those things
[3507.90 --> 3508.76]  And as one of my friends
[3508.76 --> 3509.40]  Once put it
[3509.40 --> 3510.50]  Who needs Jesus
[3510.50 --> 3512.24]  To take care of your needs
[3512.24 --> 3513.26]  If you can do it
[3513.26 --> 3513.74]  On your own
[3513.74 --> 3515.70]  So it makes you arrogant
[3515.70 --> 3516.90]  Number two
[3516.90 --> 3518.76]  I really appreciate Paul saying
[3518.76 --> 3520.10]  It's so uncertain
[3520.10 --> 3521.90]  Like can we name the reality
[3521.90 --> 3522.92]  That money can come
[3522.92 --> 3524.92]  And man can it go
[3524.92 --> 3526.02]  There's stories
[3526.02 --> 3526.88]  Even within our church
[3526.88 --> 3527.92]  Of people receiving money
[3527.92 --> 3528.50]  Getting wealthy
[3528.50 --> 3529.14]  And then poof
[3529.14 --> 3530.12]  Something goes wrong
[3530.12 --> 3530.88]  And it's gone
[3530.88 --> 3531.96]  And we have to ask
[3531.96 --> 3532.70]  Who are you then
[3532.70 --> 3534.00]  Who are you when that
[3534.00 --> 3535.04]  Big identity you built
[3535.04 --> 3535.80]  Around your finances
[3535.80 --> 3536.74]  Goes flat
[3536.74 --> 3538.52]  And your portfolio is empty
[3538.52 --> 3539.16]  Who are you then
[3539.16 --> 3541.62]  I read this week
[3541.62 --> 3542.16]  In a book called
[3542.16 --> 3543.00]  Counterfeit Gods
[3543.00 --> 3543.72]  By Tim Keller
[3543.72 --> 3545.46]  That after the 2008
[3545.46 --> 3546.44]  Financial crisis
[3546.44 --> 3547.60]  There were a number of
[3547.60 --> 3548.58]  CEOs and head
[3548.58 --> 3550.30]  Hedge fund managers
[3550.30 --> 3551.74]  Who took their own lives
[3551.74 --> 3553.50]  After that financial crisis
[3553.50 --> 3555.08]  Just think about that
[3555.08 --> 3555.42]  For a minute
[3555.42 --> 3557.90]  They took their own lives
[3557.90 --> 3559.48]  When they lost their money
[3559.48 --> 3560.88]  And there's only one
[3560.88 --> 3561.74]  Explanation for that
[3561.74 --> 3562.80]  Tim Keller goes on to say
[3562.80 --> 3564.02]  When you put your hope
[3564.02 --> 3564.42]  In money
[3564.42 --> 3565.06]  When it becomes
[3565.06 --> 3566.44]  The whole of your identity
[3566.44 --> 3567.58]  And you lose it
[3567.58 --> 3568.34]  You've got nothing
[3568.34 --> 3569.06]  Left to live for
[3569.06 --> 3570.46]  And so these people
[3570.46 --> 3571.56]  Who lived and worked
[3571.56 --> 3572.32]  And breathed money
[3572.32 --> 3573.22]  Said I'm going to
[3573.22 --> 3574.02]  Take my own life
[3574.02 --> 3574.92]  Because I have nothing
[3574.92 --> 3576.32]  Left to live for
[3576.32 --> 3578.86]  And in stark contrast
[3578.86 --> 3579.40]  To that
[3579.40 --> 3580.30]  Paul is giving us
[3580.30 --> 3580.84]  A vision
[3580.84 --> 3582.00]  Of believers
[3582.00 --> 3582.98]  In cities then
[3582.98 --> 3584.12]  And in cities now
[3584.12 --> 3585.54]  Who can when they have
[3585.54 --> 3586.76]  Wealth and finances
[3586.76 --> 3587.46]  Be generous
[3587.46 --> 3588.74]  And when they're in
[3588.74 --> 3589.54]  Times of scarcity
[3589.54 --> 3590.28]  Be content
[3590.28 --> 3591.20]  And perhaps even
[3591.20 --> 3592.28]  Generous then too
[3592.28 --> 3594.14]  Why?
[3594.66 --> 3595.94]  Because their security
[3595.94 --> 3597.60]  Is not in their bank
[3597.60 --> 3598.90]  Their identity
[3598.90 --> 3600.64]  Is not in their salary
[3600.64 --> 3603.58]  So now in the next few verses
[3603.58 --> 3604.50]  Paul starts to give
[3604.50 --> 3605.68]  Positive encouragement
[3605.68 --> 3606.84]  I want to work these out
[3606.84 --> 3607.74]  Slowly with us
[3607.74 --> 3609.10]  In terms of what he's saying
[3609.10 --> 3609.90]  To the church then
[3609.90 --> 3610.48]  And today
[3610.48 --> 3611.84]  He says
[3611.84 --> 3613.42]  Command those who are rich
[3613.42 --> 3614.84]  To put their hope in God
[3614.84 --> 3617.14]  God who richly provides us
[3617.14 --> 3618.74]  With everything for our enjoyment
[3618.74 --> 3620.56]  Command them to do good
[3620.56 --> 3622.06]  To be rich in good deeds
[3622.06 --> 3622.92]  And to be generous
[3622.92 --> 3624.36]  And willing to share
[3624.36 --> 3625.52]  In this way
[3625.52 --> 3626.44]  They will lay up treasure
[3626.44 --> 3627.04]  For themselves
[3627.04 --> 3628.20]  As a firm foundation
[3628.20 --> 3629.10]  For the coming age
[3629.10 --> 3630.90]  So that they may take hold
[3630.90 --> 3631.68]  Of life
[3631.68 --> 3633.30]  That is truly life
[3633.30 --> 3635.30]  And there's three
[3635.30 --> 3636.10]  Specific dimensions
[3636.10 --> 3636.94]  To that passage
[3636.94 --> 3637.60]  That I want to just
[3637.60 --> 3638.48]  Unpack briefly
[3638.48 --> 3639.70]  Number one
[3639.70 --> 3641.02]  Paul says
[3641.02 --> 3641.94]  Do not put your hope
[3641.94 --> 3642.30]  In money
[3642.30 --> 3643.10]  It's fleeting
[3643.10 --> 3644.10]  It's going to come
[3644.10 --> 3644.68]  And it's going to go
[3644.68 --> 3645.80]  Put your hope in God
[3645.80 --> 3646.42]  Why?
[3646.68 --> 3647.54]  Because he's the one
[3647.54 --> 3648.94]  Who gives all resources
[3648.94 --> 3650.34]  And he gives us all things
[3650.34 --> 3651.30]  So that we can enjoy
[3651.30 --> 3652.56]  His creation
[3652.56 --> 3654.70]  That is a deep reflection
[3654.70 --> 3656.02]  Paul says
[3656.02 --> 3656.54]  You know
[3656.54 --> 3657.68]  The father you serve
[3657.68 --> 3658.56]  Is not saying
[3658.56 --> 3659.62]  Divest yourself
[3659.62 --> 3660.08]  Of everything
[3660.08 --> 3660.90]  And be destitute
[3660.90 --> 3662.12]  It says here
[3662.12 --> 3663.28]  He gives us everything
[3663.28 --> 3664.86]  For our enjoyment
[3664.86 --> 3666.24]  And he wants us
[3666.24 --> 3667.22]  To enjoy the goodness
[3667.22 --> 3667.88]  Of creation
[3667.88 --> 3668.74]  And not just you
[3668.74 --> 3670.36]  He wants everyone to
[3670.36 --> 3672.44]  And I think sometimes
[3672.44 --> 3673.12]  Christians can almost
[3673.12 --> 3673.94]  Have this false sense
[3673.94 --> 3674.40]  Of guilt
[3674.40 --> 3675.50]  For the goodness
[3675.50 --> 3676.66]  They experience in the world
[3676.66 --> 3678.12]  And I want us to say
[3678.12 --> 3679.06]  As a body of believers
[3679.06 --> 3680.02]  Praise the Lord
[3680.02 --> 3681.02]  And I'll say this person
[3681.02 --> 3681.86]  I'll give my own example
[3681.86 --> 3682.56]  Praise the Lord
[3682.56 --> 3683.56]  For downhill skiing
[3683.56 --> 3686.78]  I love going with my kids
[3686.78 --> 3688.00]  To Mount Seymour
[3688.00 --> 3688.98]  Standing with the trees
[3688.98 --> 3689.52]  In the snow
[3689.52 --> 3690.86]  And flying down the hill
[3690.86 --> 3691.74]  Trying to keep up with them
[3691.74 --> 3692.50]  I love that
[3692.50 --> 3694.32]  Some of us love camping
[3694.32 --> 3695.74]  And the most dangerous
[3695.74 --> 3696.70]  Isle for you
[3696.70 --> 3697.94]  Is in Canadian Tire
[3697.94 --> 3699.10]  Are you some of those people?
[3699.96 --> 3701.26]  Some of you love
[3701.26 --> 3702.48]  Good takeout food
[3702.48 --> 3703.40]  From the restaurant
[3703.40 --> 3703.96]  Down the road
[3703.96 --> 3704.30]  Whether it's
[3704.30 --> 3705.12]  Bangtok D
[3705.12 --> 3705.76]  In Langley
[3705.76 --> 3706.44]  One of my favorites
[3706.44 --> 3707.42]  Or Chef's Kebab
[3707.42 --> 3708.02]  In Fleetwood
[3708.02 --> 3709.24]  There's such good food
[3709.24 --> 3709.94]  And when you receive
[3709.94 --> 3710.34]  That food
[3710.34 --> 3711.12]  It sits on your table
[3711.12 --> 3711.76]  And you don't have to
[3711.76 --> 3712.24]  Cook for it
[3712.24 --> 3713.38]  You say praise the Lord
[3713.38 --> 3715.54]  For the ability to enjoy
[3715.54 --> 3717.80]  The goodness of creation
[3717.80 --> 3719.86]  But then secondly
[3719.86 --> 3721.22]  Paul moves on to say
[3721.22 --> 3722.54]  If you've got money
[3722.54 --> 3724.02]  If God has given you
[3724.02 --> 3724.86]  The gift of wealth
[3724.86 --> 3726.90]  You need to be generous
[3726.90 --> 3729.30]  You need to give money away
[3729.30 --> 3730.66]  You need to be willing
[3730.66 --> 3731.46]  To share
[3731.46 --> 3732.46]  And notice
[3732.46 --> 3733.44]  This is not an invitation
[3733.44 --> 3735.48]  It's a command
[3735.48 --> 3736.60]  He's not saying
[3736.60 --> 3737.56]  Hey it might be a good idea
[3737.56 --> 3738.08]  He's like hey
[3738.08 --> 3738.76]  You got money
[3738.76 --> 3740.78]  You must share
[3740.78 --> 3742.78]  And he also knows
[3742.78 --> 3743.68]  That as the spirit of God
[3743.68 --> 3744.28]  Works in us
[3744.28 --> 3745.38]  We should want
[3745.38 --> 3746.26]  To share
[3746.26 --> 3748.34]  One of the striking things
[3748.34 --> 3749.26]  About many of the letters
[3749.26 --> 3749.96]  In the New Testament
[3749.96 --> 3751.54]  Is that Paul writes
[3751.54 --> 3751.96]  To the church
[3751.96 --> 3752.62]  And then he says to them
[3752.62 --> 3753.80]  Hey I'm going to come
[3753.80 --> 3754.48]  To your church
[3754.48 --> 3755.40]  And when I do
[3755.40 --> 3756.30]  I'm actually taking up
[3756.30 --> 3757.68]  The collection myself
[3757.68 --> 3759.20]  In Romans by the way
[3759.20 --> 3760.66]  I think it's chapter 13
[3760.66 --> 3762.10]  After this long theological
[3762.10 --> 3762.74]  Deep teaching
[3762.74 --> 3763.64]  On the story of the Bible
[3763.64 --> 3764.60]  He says by the way
[3764.60 --> 3765.40]  The reason I'm coming
[3765.40 --> 3766.50]  Is because I'm taking up
[3766.50 --> 3766.92]  A collection
[3766.92 --> 3768.26]  And I want you to give
[3768.26 --> 3769.06]  Because there's believers
[3769.06 --> 3770.34]  In Jerusalem
[3770.34 --> 3771.42]  Who are really struggling
[3771.42 --> 3772.48]  And you've got money
[3772.48 --> 3773.40]  So I'm taking your money
[3773.40 --> 3774.14]  To care for them
[3774.14 --> 3775.16]  And he had no shame
[3775.16 --> 3775.70]  Doing it
[3775.70 --> 3776.72]  Because he saw
[3776.72 --> 3778.04]  That one of the gifts
[3778.04 --> 3779.56]  That the wealthy can give
[3779.56 --> 3780.62]  Is taking care of
[3780.62 --> 3781.46]  The brothers and sisters
[3781.46 --> 3782.90]  In another city
[3782.90 --> 3784.12]  And the brothers and sisters
[3784.12 --> 3784.94]  In their own city
[3784.94 --> 3787.98]  It's worth noting as well
[3787.98 --> 3789.20]  That I think the gratitude
[3789.20 --> 3789.94]  For the good things
[3789.94 --> 3791.08]  Of creation that we enjoy
[3791.08 --> 3792.44]  Should lead to the groaning
[3792.44 --> 3794.24]  For all the things
[3794.24 --> 3795.04]  That many people in the world
[3795.04 --> 3796.10]  Do not get to enjoy
[3796.10 --> 3797.70]  As you enjoy the gift
[3797.70 --> 3798.32]  Of take out
[3798.32 --> 3799.88]  We need to be aware
[3799.88 --> 3800.28]  That there's people
[3800.28 --> 3801.14]  Who don't eat anything
[3801.14 --> 3802.92]  As you enjoy the gift
[3802.92 --> 3804.32]  Of being on a mountain skiing
[3804.32 --> 3804.78]  You'll realize
[3804.78 --> 3805.36]  There's many people
[3805.36 --> 3806.08]  Who will never be able
[3806.08 --> 3807.16]  To see the beautiful sights
[3807.16 --> 3807.80]  That you get to see
[3807.80 --> 3808.76]  Because I live in slums
[3808.76 --> 3809.98]  And the gratitude
[3809.98 --> 3811.10]  For the way we get to enjoy
[3811.10 --> 3812.06]  The goodness of creation
[3812.06 --> 3814.70]  Must fuel a groaning
[3814.70 --> 3815.58]  For the problems
[3815.58 --> 3816.22]  And the pain
[3816.22 --> 3817.86]  That fuels a generosity
[3817.86 --> 3818.60]  To care
[3818.60 --> 3819.66]  For our neighbors
[3819.66 --> 3820.62]  Our brothers and sisters
[3820.62 --> 3821.68]  And our world
[3821.68 --> 3822.98]  They're connected
[3822.98 --> 3825.18]  The third thing
[3825.18 --> 3825.72]  In this passage
[3825.72 --> 3827.08]  That I find so striking
[3827.08 --> 3828.72]  Is what he says at the end
[3828.72 --> 3830.02]  That by giving
[3830.02 --> 3831.28]  And by being generous
[3831.28 --> 3832.82]  And by caring for the needs
[3832.82 --> 3833.50]  Of those around
[3833.50 --> 3835.70]  We set up treasures in heaven
[3835.70 --> 3836.84]  As a firm foundation
[3836.84 --> 3837.78]  For the age to come
[3837.78 --> 3838.78]  Isn't that an interesting passage?
[3839.82 --> 3840.74]  We store up ourselves
[3840.74 --> 3841.74]  Treasures in heaven
[3841.74 --> 3843.64]  So that we can choose life
[3843.64 --> 3844.38]  And experience life
[3844.38 --> 3845.28]  That is truly life
[3845.28 --> 3846.76]  Maybe a different way
[3846.76 --> 3847.26]  To put it
[3847.26 --> 3847.90]  And I'm stealing from
[3847.90 --> 3848.82]  Someone else on this one
[3848.82 --> 3850.90]  Is that by being generous now
[3850.90 --> 3851.96]  We're practicing
[3851.96 --> 3852.80]  What all humans
[3852.80 --> 3853.60]  Are going to be like
[3853.60 --> 3854.92]  When Jesus returns in glory
[3854.92 --> 3856.94]  When Jesus returns
[3856.94 --> 3858.28]  Wealth will be distributed
[3858.28 --> 3859.44]  People will not have any needs
[3859.44 --> 3860.42]  And we will all live
[3860.42 --> 3862.10]  In a fully generous human way
[3862.10 --> 3863.82]  And we get to start now
[3863.82 --> 3864.76]  Through the work of Jesus
[3864.76 --> 3866.44]  To practice the generosity
[3866.44 --> 3867.42]  That will be normal
[3867.42 --> 3868.64]  In the age to come
[3868.64 --> 3870.66]  That will be the true life
[3870.66 --> 3871.68]  That all of us experience
[3871.68 --> 3873.12]  When Christ returns in glory
[3873.12 --> 3877.10]  John Stott gives
[3877.10 --> 3878.22]  A phenomenal summary
[3878.22 --> 3879.36]  Of this passage
[3879.36 --> 3880.38]  That I put on the screen
[3880.38 --> 3881.36]  For us to read together
[3881.36 --> 3882.70]  I think this is just
[3882.70 --> 3884.36]  Such a wise and great summary
[3884.36 --> 3885.14]  Of this whole passage
[3885.14 --> 3885.64]  He writes
[3885.64 --> 3887.52]  Looking over both paragraphs
[3887.52 --> 3888.14]  About money
[3888.14 --> 3889.76]  The apostle's balanced wisdom
[3889.76 --> 3890.52]  Becomes apparent
[3890.52 --> 3892.48]  Against materialism
[3892.48 --> 3894.32]  An obsession with material possessions
[3894.32 --> 3896.96]  He sets simplicity of lifestyle
[3896.96 --> 3899.10]  Against asceticism
[3899.10 --> 3900.24]  The repudiation
[3900.24 --> 3902.34]  Or not enjoying the material order
[3902.34 --> 3903.88]  He sets gratitude
[3903.88 --> 3905.38]  For God's creation
[3905.38 --> 3907.72]  Against covetousness
[3907.72 --> 3909.12]  A lust for more possessions
[3909.12 --> 3910.54]  He sets contentment
[3910.54 --> 3910.56]  He sets contentment
[3910.56 --> 3911.48]  With what we have
[3911.48 --> 3913.38]  Against selfishness
[3913.38 --> 3914.64]  The accumulation of goods
[3914.64 --> 3915.56]  For ourselves
[3915.56 --> 3917.16]  He sets generosity
[3917.16 --> 3919.12]  In imitation of God
[3919.12 --> 3920.94]  Simplicity
[3920.94 --> 3922.44]  Gratitude
[3922.44 --> 3923.60]  Contentment
[3923.60 --> 3924.74]  And generosity
[3924.74 --> 3926.40]  Constitute a healthy
[3926.40 --> 3931.30]  Is that a great quote
[3931.30 --> 3934.40]  So let's bring this teaching home
[3934.40 --> 3934.84]  Okay
[3934.84 --> 3935.92]  Let's bring this right home
[3935.92 --> 3937.20]  To our own places
[3937.20 --> 3938.18]  Our own spaces
[3938.18 --> 3939.48]  The way we manage
[3939.48 --> 3940.08]  Our own money
[3940.08 --> 3941.32]  And here's the question
[3941.32 --> 3943.64]  Could those four words
[3943.64 --> 3944.70]  Describe your home?
[3945.38 --> 3946.32]  Do they describe
[3946.32 --> 3947.56]  The household that you live in?
[3947.82 --> 3948.74]  Could it be said of you
[3948.74 --> 3949.50]  If someone lived with you
[3949.50 --> 3950.38]  For a week or a month
[3950.38 --> 3950.90]  Or a year
[3950.90 --> 3952.64]  Man they lived simply
[3952.64 --> 3955.00]  They lived with such gratitude
[3955.00 --> 3955.52]  To God
[3955.52 --> 3956.26]  For what they had
[3956.26 --> 3958.30]  They were truly content
[3958.30 --> 3959.66]  Not chasing after more
[3959.66 --> 3961.76]  And they were generous
[3961.76 --> 3963.42]  Could that be said
[3963.42 --> 3963.92]  Of your household?
[3965.80 --> 3966.66]  I think
[3966.66 --> 3967.92]  This is my own take
[3967.92 --> 3969.14]  That for many of us
[3969.14 --> 3970.28]  Who grew up in Canada
[3970.28 --> 3971.56]  And who've lived here
[3971.56 --> 3972.14]  For a while
[3972.14 --> 3974.18]  We are so steeped
[3974.18 --> 3975.14]  In a greedy culture
[3975.14 --> 3976.44]  In a culture
[3976.44 --> 3977.40]  That chases after
[3977.40 --> 3978.08]  Material possessions
[3978.08 --> 3979.02]  That we're not even sure
[3979.02 --> 3980.10]  What it looks like
[3980.10 --> 3981.52]  To have a healthy relationship
[3981.52 --> 3982.02]  With money
[3982.02 --> 3983.90]  We're so used to
[3983.90 --> 3985.76]  Justifying what we do
[3985.76 --> 3986.90]  Because we know someone
[3986.90 --> 3987.86]  Even some Christian
[3987.86 --> 3988.78]  Who makes more than us
[3988.78 --> 3989.50]  That we just find a way
[3989.50 --> 3990.64]  Of justifying all of our purchases
[3990.64 --> 3991.46]  All of our lifestyle
[3991.46 --> 3992.18]  Everything we do
[3992.18 --> 3992.38]  Is just
[3992.38 --> 3993.40]  It's kind of okay
[3993.40 --> 3995.96]  Tim Keller mentioned
[3995.96 --> 3997.04]  In one of his talks
[3997.04 --> 3997.78]  A while ago
[3997.78 --> 3999.54]  That in his entire ministry
[3999.54 --> 4000.62]  He was pastor in New York
[4000.62 --> 4001.42]  For many many years
[4001.42 --> 4002.66]  His entire ministry
[4002.66 --> 4003.52]  He had people confess
[4003.52 --> 4004.62]  Many different sins to him
[4004.62 --> 4005.16]  But you know what
[4005.16 --> 4006.60]  People never confess to him?
[4007.60 --> 4007.96]  Greed
[4007.96 --> 4010.06]  In his entire ministry
[4010.06 --> 4010.86]  In New York
[4010.86 --> 4012.30]  He never had one person
[4012.30 --> 4012.84]  Come up to him
[4012.84 --> 4013.12]  And say
[4013.12 --> 4013.80]  You know Tim
[4013.80 --> 4015.66]  I love money too much
[4015.66 --> 4017.54]  It's just a huge problem
[4017.54 --> 4018.46]  I chase after it
[4018.46 --> 4019.52]  It's an idol in my heart
[4019.52 --> 4020.56]  And I need to deal with it
[4020.56 --> 4021.96]  I need repenting of it
[4021.96 --> 4022.44]  He says
[4022.44 --> 4023.92]  Never once
[4023.92 --> 4025.20]  Did someone confess
[4025.20 --> 4025.96]  The idol of greed
[4025.96 --> 4026.62]  And that suggests
[4026.62 --> 4027.34]  At least to me
[4027.34 --> 4028.86]  That there's just something
[4028.86 --> 4030.88]  Insidious and deceptive
[4030.88 --> 4032.40]  About the lure
[4032.40 --> 4033.70]  And power of wealth
[4033.70 --> 4035.38]  For all of us
[4035.38 --> 4037.14]  And we need to be honest
[4037.14 --> 4039.08]  Ask hard questions
[4039.08 --> 4040.94]  Be willing to be vulnerable
[4040.94 --> 4041.64]  And up front
[4041.64 --> 4042.58]  About how we steward
[4042.58 --> 4043.84]  The money God gives us
[4043.84 --> 4045.78]  Here are some good questions
[4045.78 --> 4047.12]  That I think would be helpful
[4047.12 --> 4048.72]  To ask around the dinner table
[4048.72 --> 4050.46]  In your small group
[4050.46 --> 4051.72]  With your roommates
[4051.72 --> 4053.48]  Number one
[4053.48 --> 4054.92]  Are you content
[4054.92 --> 4055.82]  With what you have?
[4056.38 --> 4057.84]  If you had only what you have now
[4057.84 --> 4058.86]  For the rest of your life
[4058.86 --> 4060.32]  Would you be content?
[4060.32 --> 4063.58]  Or do we live in such a way
[4063.58 --> 4064.08]  That suggests
[4064.08 --> 4064.68]  We'll be happy
[4064.68 --> 4065.46]  Only if
[4065.46 --> 4067.32]  We get that bigger space
[4067.32 --> 4069.22]  That renovated space
[4069.22 --> 4070.80]  That nicer vehicle
[4070.80 --> 4072.56]  Those nicer clothes
[4072.56 --> 4074.32]  Or that number in the RRSP
[4074.84 --> 4075.90]  Before we retire
[4075.90 --> 4077.48]  Do we live that way?
[4078.48 --> 4080.20]  Can we part with our money?
[4081.10 --> 4081.96]  Can you give it away
[4081.96 --> 4083.32]  Without being frustrated
[4083.32 --> 4084.50]  Or thinking that
[4084.50 --> 4085.66]  That person or that cause
[4085.66 --> 4086.92]  Is now indebted to you
[4086.92 --> 4088.14]  Because you've given money
[4088.14 --> 4088.88]  Can you give it away?
[4089.48 --> 4089.88]  Generously
[4089.88 --> 4090.70]  Freely
[4090.70 --> 4091.82]  Willingly
[4091.82 --> 4094.72]  A couple years ago
[4094.72 --> 4096.20]  Barnard Research Group
[4096.20 --> 4097.86]  Did a study in the States
[4097.86 --> 4098.76]  On Christian giving
[4098.76 --> 4099.88]  You're not going to like these stats
[4099.88 --> 4100.52]  I'll just give it
[4100.52 --> 4101.84]  Be up front about this
[4101.84 --> 4102.74]  And
[4102.74 --> 4103.36]  But you know
[4103.36 --> 4104.10]  You can write this off
[4104.10 --> 4104.96]  And say it's just Americans
[4104.96 --> 4105.64]  We're much better
[4105.64 --> 4106.58]  But I have a feeling
[4106.58 --> 4107.84]  That these stats translate
[4107.84 --> 4108.52]  You ready for this?
[4109.06 --> 4109.74]  They discovered that
[4109.74 --> 4110.74]  50% of Christians
[4110.74 --> 4111.46]  Give nothing
[4111.46 --> 4113.56]  Absolutely
[4113.56 --> 4114.88]  Nothing
[4114.88 --> 4115.60]  Away
[4115.60 --> 4118.48]  I find that so hard
[4118.48 --> 4119.18]  To believe
[4119.18 --> 4121.06]  Then here's the other one
[4121.06 --> 4122.14]  They found out
[4122.14 --> 4123.76]  Of those who do give
[4123.76 --> 4125.56]  The average Christian giving
[4125.56 --> 4128.08]  Is just over 3%
[4128.08 --> 4130.90]  And it's worth noting
[4130.90 --> 4131.66]  That in the Old Testament
[4131.66 --> 4133.06]  Believers
[4133.06 --> 4134.18]  God's followers
[4134.18 --> 4135.72]  Were commanded to give 10%
[4135.72 --> 4137.60]  Of what they received back
[4137.60 --> 4138.96]  In the New Testament
[4138.96 --> 4140.34]  There's not a necessary command
[4140.34 --> 4140.98]  But it's a command
[4140.98 --> 4141.52]  To be generous
[4141.52 --> 4142.14]  That we're seeing
[4142.14 --> 4142.98]  Even this passage
[4142.98 --> 4144.06]  But somehow
[4144.06 --> 4145.16]  We know the Old Testament
[4145.16 --> 4145.54]  Command
[4145.54 --> 4146.60]  We know that we're
[4146.60 --> 4147.34]  Commanded to be generous
[4147.34 --> 4148.06]  And we say
[4148.06 --> 4148.98]  No way
[4148.98 --> 4151.18]  Or we find all sorts
[4151.18 --> 4151.68]  Of excuses
[4151.68 --> 4152.60]  To not practice
[4152.60 --> 4153.20]  The very thing
[4153.20 --> 4154.26]  We're commanded to do
[4154.26 --> 4155.50]  In this passage
[4155.50 --> 4156.84]  And we need to ask
[4156.84 --> 4157.20]  The question
[4157.20 --> 4158.24]  What makes giving
[4158.24 --> 4160.10]  Hard for us?
[4161.10 --> 4162.02]  What are the questions
[4162.02 --> 4163.18]  We need to ask ourselves
[4163.18 --> 4164.14]  About our own patterns
[4164.14 --> 4164.90]  Our own spending
[4164.90 --> 4165.98]  Our own desires
[4165.98 --> 4167.56]  That withhold us
[4167.56 --> 4169.06]  From practicing generosity?
[4169.06 --> 4171.92]  Now here's the point
[4171.92 --> 4172.38]  Of my sermon
[4172.38 --> 4173.40]  Where I just want to know
[4173.40 --> 4174.16]  I want to say
[4174.16 --> 4175.32]  I get where your brain
[4175.32 --> 4176.26]  Is probably going
[4176.26 --> 4177.74]  I said this in 9am service
[4177.74 --> 4178.30]  I'll say it again
[4178.30 --> 4179.26]  Most of us
[4179.26 --> 4179.90]  Are probably thinking
[4179.90 --> 4181.22]  Okay Dave
[4181.22 --> 4183.36]  We live in British Columbia
[4183.36 --> 4185.54]  Which someone told me
[4185.54 --> 4186.68]  Is one of the three
[4186.68 --> 4188.20]  Top most expensive places
[4188.20 --> 4189.18]  In the world
[4189.18 --> 4190.04]  To live
[4190.04 --> 4191.40]  And here you are
[4191.40 --> 4192.18]  With the audacity
[4192.18 --> 4192.72]  To say hey
[4192.72 --> 4193.58]  Let's be generous
[4193.58 --> 4195.38]  Or let me add to that
[4195.38 --> 4196.04]  Hey Dave
[4196.04 --> 4196.88]  Did you know
[4196.88 --> 4197.72]  That inflation's
[4197.72 --> 4198.92]  On the rise in Canada?
[4199.06 --> 4200.38]  And that interest rates
[4200.38 --> 4201.40]  On our variable mortgage
[4201.40 --> 4202.02]  Make it so that
[4202.02 --> 4203.14]  We're paying the same amount
[4203.14 --> 4204.80]  We're actually losing money
[4204.80 --> 4205.54]  On the house
[4205.54 --> 4207.04]  That we bought two years ago
[4207.04 --> 4207.60]  Or the condo
[4207.60 --> 4208.64]  We bought three years ago
[4208.64 --> 4209.86]  Not to mention
[4209.86 --> 4210.94]  The insane rent
[4210.94 --> 4212.52]  That makes it almost impossible
[4212.52 --> 4213.42]  To buy a house
[4213.42 --> 4215.24]  And that's not to mention
[4215.24 --> 4216.38]  You know as an Ontarian
[4216.38 --> 4217.34]  I just have to say this
[4217.34 --> 4218.20]  When people move
[4218.20 --> 4219.10]  From other parts of Canada
[4219.10 --> 4219.78]  To BC
[4219.78 --> 4220.20]  We're like
[4220.20 --> 4221.50]  So why is everything
[4221.50 --> 4223.08]  More expensive in this province?
[4223.38 --> 4224.94]  Like insurance, food, gas
[4224.94 --> 4225.32]  All of it
[4225.32 --> 4226.36]  Like oh you moved to BC?
[4226.84 --> 4227.98]  Welcome to more expensive
[4227.98 --> 4229.58]  And here's Pastor Dave
[4229.58 --> 4230.64]  Saying let's be generous
[4230.64 --> 4234.70]  We cannot allow
[4234.70 --> 4236.88]  Some of these financial challenges
[4236.88 --> 4238.20]  To blind us
[4238.20 --> 4239.38]  To the reality
[4239.38 --> 4240.68]  Of living in Canada
[4240.68 --> 4242.42]  Let me just name
[4242.42 --> 4243.20]  A few things
[4243.20 --> 4244.38]  A few privileges
[4244.38 --> 4245.34]  That we experience
[4245.34 --> 4245.88]  Every day
[4245.88 --> 4246.70]  For the most part
[4246.70 --> 4248.08]  That is not shared
[4248.08 --> 4248.86]  By the rest of our
[4248.86 --> 4249.48]  Brothers and sisters
[4249.48 --> 4250.10]  In the world
[4250.10 --> 4251.52]  Or even in our country
[4251.52 --> 4252.36]  You're ready for this
[4252.36 --> 4253.70]  For the most part
[4253.70 --> 4254.72]  With some exceptions
[4254.72 --> 4256.38]  We can get work
[4256.38 --> 4258.54]  We can find steady jobs
[4258.54 --> 4260.46]  We have access
[4260.46 --> 4261.14]  To healthcare
[4261.14 --> 4263.00]  Every single one of us
[4263.00 --> 4264.40]  Safe travel
[4264.40 --> 4265.32]  Maternity leave
[4265.32 --> 4266.38]  Child tax benefit
[4266.38 --> 4267.34]  Employment income
[4267.34 --> 4268.38]  If we lose work
[4268.38 --> 4270.56]  All sorts of resources
[4270.56 --> 4271.82]  At our disposal
[4271.82 --> 4272.62]  And let me just say
[4272.62 --> 4274.12]  Very few people
[4274.12 --> 4275.44]  In the world
[4275.44 --> 4276.68]  Have access to that
[4276.68 --> 4278.90]  Very few Christians
[4278.90 --> 4279.94]  In the world
[4279.94 --> 4281.06]  Have access to that
[4281.06 --> 4282.62]  You know as one person
[4282.62 --> 4283.38]  Once said to me
[4283.38 --> 4284.36]  Who lived in India
[4284.36 --> 4286.58]  That to be born in Canada
[4286.58 --> 4289.14]  Is to win the cosmic lottery
[4289.14 --> 4291.96]  Is to be born in one of the safest
[4291.96 --> 4295.16]  Wealthiest parts of the entire globe
[4295.16 --> 4297.40]  And I'm so worried
[4297.40 --> 4299.00]  That sometimes when we grow up in it
[4299.00 --> 4299.62]  Or we live in it
[4299.62 --> 4301.34]  We have no idea
[4301.34 --> 4303.56]  Just how good it is
[4303.56 --> 4304.50]  Where we live
[4304.50 --> 4306.32]  And I think what's needed
[4306.32 --> 4307.78]  For Western believers
[4307.78 --> 4309.26]  Is to get close to pain
[4309.26 --> 4311.32]  Get close to poverty
[4311.32 --> 4312.84]  Get close to real needs
[4312.84 --> 4313.72]  Build some friendships
[4313.72 --> 4315.04]  With people who are not
[4315.04 --> 4316.64]  In the same socioeconomic category
[4316.64 --> 4317.50]  And you're going to see
[4317.50 --> 4318.46]  Just how good
[4318.46 --> 4319.90]  Most of us have it
[4319.90 --> 4322.40]  This is not a time
[4322.40 --> 4323.84]  For the Western church
[4323.84 --> 4324.74]  To be tight-fisted
[4324.74 --> 4326.24]  Selfish
[4326.24 --> 4327.58]  Or fearful
[4327.58 --> 4328.78]  About finances
[4328.78 --> 4330.28]  I really do believe
[4330.28 --> 4331.28]  That if we think globally
[4331.28 --> 4332.46]  We will see just how
[4332.46 --> 4333.32]  Insanely wealthy
[4333.32 --> 4334.30]  The Western church is
[4334.30 --> 4335.90]  And the beautiful responsibility
[4335.90 --> 4336.98]  We as a whole have
[4336.98 --> 4338.78]  To care for our brothers and sisters
[4338.78 --> 4339.90]  Who are struggling
[4339.90 --> 4341.10]  In very profound ways
[4341.10 --> 4344.08]  I think it may be helpful
[4344.08 --> 4344.72]  At this point
[4344.72 --> 4345.56]  To share a story
[4345.56 --> 4346.62]  About how this affects
[4346.62 --> 4347.66]  Brittany and I
[4347.66 --> 4348.74]  In our own relationship
[4348.74 --> 4350.38]  Part of our own story
[4350.38 --> 4351.86]  Is me dealing with my own greed
[4351.86 --> 4353.12]  I'll just be honest about that
[4353.12 --> 4354.00]  As a kid
[4354.00 --> 4354.92]  Maybe you can relate
[4354.92 --> 4356.96]  I was a saver
[4356.96 --> 4358.22]  Capital S
[4358.22 --> 4359.52]  I didn't even need to save
[4359.52 --> 4360.04]  For anything
[4360.04 --> 4361.82]  I just liked to save
[4361.82 --> 4363.08]  Anyone can relate to this?
[4363.08 --> 4364.64]  And when I was a teenager
[4364.64 --> 4365.52]  And I got a job
[4365.52 --> 4367.08]  My parents forced me to give
[4367.08 --> 4369.54]  I was so angry about that
[4369.54 --> 4371.92]  That I felt so unjust
[4371.92 --> 4373.16]  I worked for this money
[4373.16 --> 4374.60]  And now I have to give it
[4374.60 --> 4375.24]  To my church
[4375.24 --> 4376.80]  And I went through a process
[4376.80 --> 4377.94]  Of learning how to part
[4377.94 --> 4378.52]  With my money
[4378.52 --> 4379.52]  And I felt like I was growing
[4379.52 --> 4380.68]  And then I met my wife Brittany
[4380.68 --> 4383.28]  And the Lord has some sense of humor
[4383.28 --> 4384.32]  When he brings couples together
[4384.32 --> 4385.26]  Because if you know Brittany
[4385.26 --> 4387.48]  You'll know that she is very generous
[4387.48 --> 4389.50]  And I had to grow
[4389.50 --> 4391.84]  As I met married Brittany
[4391.84 --> 4393.18]  And there was one story
[4393.18 --> 4393.66]  I would say
[4393.66 --> 4394.94]  It's a bit of a milestone story
[4394.94 --> 4395.50]  In our marriage
[4395.50 --> 4396.54]  Because it was a moment
[4396.54 --> 4397.76]  Of conflict about finances
[4397.76 --> 4399.16]  It was a time
[4399.16 --> 4400.24]  Where I was studying at Calvin
[4400.24 --> 4401.58]  I was finishing up my degree
[4401.58 --> 4403.74]  And I remember going into the school
[4403.74 --> 4404.70]  To pay for my tuition
[4404.70 --> 4405.66]  And I came home
[4405.66 --> 4406.20]  And I'm like Brittany
[4406.20 --> 4407.76]  We are well and truly broke
[4407.76 --> 4408.46]  Like this is
[4408.46 --> 4409.34]  This is as broke
[4409.34 --> 4410.20]  As I've ever been
[4410.20 --> 4412.50]  And very shortly after that
[4412.50 --> 4413.50]  I don't want to give a timeline
[4413.50 --> 4414.88]  But it was pretty close
[4414.88 --> 4415.50]  To that experience
[4415.50 --> 4416.94]  I came from class again
[4416.94 --> 4417.38]  And Brittany
[4417.38 --> 4418.42]  Almost like a confession
[4418.42 --> 4418.86]  Said
[4418.86 --> 4421.50]  So I gave some money away
[4421.50 --> 4424.18]  To this particular cause
[4424.18 --> 4425.62]  And I'm not going to say
[4425.62 --> 4426.52]  What the cause was
[4426.52 --> 4427.78]  I'll let Brittany share that
[4427.78 --> 4428.32]  If she wants
[4428.32 --> 4430.12]  But I was so upset
[4430.12 --> 4431.22]  I was like
[4431.22 --> 4432.64]  That cause can wait
[4432.64 --> 4434.56]  The Groons need to take care
[4434.56 --> 4435.66]  Of the Groons today
[4435.66 --> 4437.32]  We're struggling financially
[4437.32 --> 4439.24]  And that was a moment
[4439.24 --> 4440.30]  Where Dave Groon
[4440.30 --> 4441.38]  Had to come to terms
[4441.38 --> 4443.54]  With how I perceived scarcity
[4443.54 --> 4445.12]  That's a time
[4445.12 --> 4445.88]  Where Dave Groon
[4445.88 --> 4446.36]  Had to learn
[4446.36 --> 4447.14]  Do I really believe
[4447.14 --> 4448.24]  That God will take care of me
[4448.24 --> 4449.96]  And more importantly
[4449.96 --> 4451.82]  Have I lost sight
[4451.82 --> 4453.90]  Of how good we still had it
[4453.90 --> 4454.78]  Even in that season
[4454.78 --> 4455.36]  At Calvin
[4455.36 --> 4456.52]  Where we could actually
[4456.52 --> 4457.22]  Find many ways
[4457.22 --> 4457.82]  To be generous
[4457.82 --> 4459.06]  And this has been
[4459.06 --> 4460.20]  A learning journey for me
[4460.20 --> 4460.70]  It's a journey
[4460.70 --> 4461.70]  Where I continue to learn
[4461.70 --> 4462.32]  Because I think
[4462.32 --> 4463.84]  Growing up in Canada
[4463.84 --> 4465.16]  Makes you blind
[4465.16 --> 4467.72]  To the real seductive power
[4467.72 --> 4468.76]  And lure of money
[4468.76 --> 4470.16]  And that includes pastors
[4470.16 --> 4471.02]  Just like me
[4471.02 --> 4473.74]  So let me return
[4473.74 --> 4474.58]  To where we begin
[4474.58 --> 4475.78]  With pre-marriage counseling
[4475.78 --> 4477.78]  When Brittany and I
[4477.78 --> 4478.52]  Talk about money
[4478.52 --> 4479.02]  With couples
[4479.02 --> 4480.82]  And even as a couple
[4480.82 --> 4481.98]  We've come to realize
[4481.98 --> 4482.86]  That every conversation
[4482.86 --> 4483.80]  About money for believers
[4483.80 --> 4485.46]  Is a spiritual conversation
[4485.46 --> 4487.40]  When we talk about money
[4487.40 --> 4488.68]  It is deeply related
[4488.68 --> 4489.50]  To our relationship
[4489.50 --> 4490.02]  With Jesus
[4490.02 --> 4491.30]  Whether you know it or not
[4491.30 --> 4493.22]  And so how we steward it
[4493.22 --> 4495.68]  Is a very important question
[4495.68 --> 4498.76]  And here's the bottom line
[4498.76 --> 4500.60]  One that I've discovered
[4500.60 --> 4501.62]  And I hope many of us
[4501.62 --> 4502.60]  Have discovered as well
[4502.60 --> 4504.34]  There is only one person
[4504.34 --> 4505.12]  Who can free us
[4505.12 --> 4506.12]  From the lure of wealth
[4506.12 --> 4508.44]  The constant hunger
[4508.44 --> 4509.62]  For more
[4509.62 --> 4511.54]  And that is Jesus Christ
[4511.54 --> 4513.76]  He is the only one
[4513.76 --> 4514.76]  Who can make us generous
[4514.76 --> 4515.40]  Who can open up
[4515.40 --> 4516.72]  Our tight-fisted
[4516.72 --> 4517.70]  Cold-hearted
[4517.70 --> 4518.44]  Callous hearts
[4518.44 --> 4519.28]  To the needs around us
[4519.28 --> 4520.68]  So that we desire
[4520.68 --> 4522.42]  To give
[4522.42 --> 4524.26]  Of what God has given us
[4524.26 --> 4526.02]  It is Jesus himself
[4526.02 --> 4527.08]  Who not only models
[4527.08 --> 4527.86]  Generosity
[4527.86 --> 4528.78]  And contentment
[4528.78 --> 4529.36]  And simplicity
[4529.36 --> 4530.74]  Is Jesus himself
[4530.74 --> 4532.70]  Who comes from the glory
[4532.70 --> 4533.36]  Of heaven
[4533.36 --> 4535.48]  Who enters our reality
[4535.48 --> 4536.46]  As a slave
[4536.46 --> 4538.02]  Who empties himself
[4538.02 --> 4539.12]  Of all the benefits
[4539.12 --> 4540.16]  That come with being God
[4540.16 --> 4541.98]  So that he can rescue us
[4541.98 --> 4542.96]  From the grip
[4542.96 --> 4544.16]  Of idolatry
[4544.16 --> 4545.92]  And money
[4545.92 --> 4547.08]  Is one of those idols
[4547.08 --> 4548.86]  It is Jesus Christ
[4548.86 --> 4549.88]  Who hangs on the cross
[4549.88 --> 4551.46]  Defeats its power
[4551.46 --> 4552.38]  Of the power of death
[4552.38 --> 4552.88]  And sin
[4552.88 --> 4554.64]  So that we can be released
[4554.64 --> 4555.82]  Of our slavery
[4555.82 --> 4557.20]  To all the idols
[4557.20 --> 4558.22]  That grip our hearts
[4558.22 --> 4559.64]  And that includes money
[4559.64 --> 4562.24]  And Jesus in his resurrection
[4562.24 --> 4563.72]  Says if you follow me
[4563.72 --> 4565.60]  You will gain my power
[4565.60 --> 4566.80]  My strength
[4566.80 --> 4568.10]  Through my spirit
[4568.10 --> 4569.66]  To live simply
[4569.66 --> 4571.66]  To live contentedly
[4571.66 --> 4574.18]  To live gratefully
[4574.18 --> 4577.12]  And to give generously
[4577.12 --> 4579.12]  That is the way
[4579.12 --> 4580.08]  Of Jesus Christ
[4580.08 --> 4581.98]  And that is a prophetic
[4581.98 --> 4583.64]  Invitation to faith
[4583.64 --> 4585.52]  In a culture obsessed
[4585.52 --> 4586.86]  With consumption
[4586.86 --> 4587.88]  And accumulation
[4587.88 --> 4588.52]  Of money
[4588.52 --> 4590.42]  Would you join me
[4590.42 --> 4590.76]  In prayer
[4590.76 --> 4597.66]  Father we thank you
[4597.66 --> 4598.64]  For your generosity
[4598.64 --> 4601.08]  Extended to us
[4601.08 --> 4602.12]  In the person of Jesus
[4602.12 --> 4603.96]  And we thank you
[4603.96 --> 4604.58]  That through Jesus
[4604.58 --> 4606.00]  We have inherited all things
[4606.00 --> 4607.86]  That we have salvation
[4607.86 --> 4609.54]  We have provision
[4609.54 --> 4611.36]  We have your presence
[4611.36 --> 4612.74]  And we praise you for it
[4612.74 --> 4615.36]  Lord we confess our greed
[4615.36 --> 4618.22]  We confess our selfishness
[4618.22 --> 4620.70]  We confess our callous hearts
[4620.70 --> 4622.02]  To the needs right around us
[4622.02 --> 4622.88]  And around the world
[4622.88 --> 4625.04]  And we pray that by your spirit
[4625.04 --> 4626.26]  You would break our hearts
[4626.26 --> 4628.36]  You would change us
[4628.36 --> 4630.02]  And you would make us reflect
[4630.02 --> 4630.74]  The simple
[4630.74 --> 4632.60]  Content
[4632.60 --> 4634.24]  Grateful
[4634.24 --> 4635.50]  And generous savior
[4635.50 --> 4636.60]  Jesus Christ
[4636.60 --> 4638.42]  We pray in his name
[4638.42 --> 4639.44]  Amen
[4639.44 --> 4642.88]  I invite you to stand
[4642.88 --> 4643.42]  And sing with me
[4643.42 --> 4644.34]  A song of response
[4644.34 --> 4645.90]  Jesus all for Jesus
[4645.90 --> 4647.38]  And I just want you to know
[4647.38 --> 4648.54]  There's a line in this song
[4648.54 --> 4649.64]  That gets me every time
[4649.64 --> 4650.44]  The chorus is
[4650.44 --> 4652.10]  For it's only in your will
[4652.10 --> 4653.70]  That we are free
[4653.70 --> 4654.70]  It's only in following
[4654.70 --> 4655.38]  The way of Jesus
[4655.38 --> 4656.12]  That we discover
[4656.12 --> 4657.82]  The life that is truly life
[4657.82 --> 4658.76]  So let's sing together
[4658.76 --> 4659.80]  Jesus all for Jesus
[4659.80 --> 4689.78]  Jesus all for Jesus
[4689.78 --> 4695.24]  All I am and have
[4695.24 --> 4700.24]  And ever hope to be
[4700.24 --> 4707.24]  Jesus all for Jesus
[4707.24 --> 4711.24]  All for Jesus
[4711.24 --> 4718.62]  All I am and have
[4718.62 --> 4722.70]  And ever hope to be
[4722.70 --> 4729.86]  All of my
[4729.86 --> 4735.78]  Ambitions, thoughts, and plans
[4735.78 --> 4741.36]  I surrender these
[4741.36 --> 4745.62]  Into your hands
[4745.62 --> 4750.22]  All of my
[4750.22 --> 4758.14]  Ambitions, thoughts, and plans
[4758.14 --> 4763.74]  I surrender these
[4763.74 --> 4768.42]  Into your hands
[4768.42 --> 4776.44]  For it's only in your will
[4776.44 --> 4778.88]  That I am free
[4778.88 --> 4787.58]  For it's only in your will
[4787.58 --> 4791.88]  That I am free
[4791.88 --> 4797.34]  Jesus all for Jesus
[4797.34 --> 4801.34]  All for Jesus
[4801.34 --> 4803.34]  All for Jesus
[4803.34 --> 4808.34]  All I am and have
[4808.34 --> 4812.88]  And ever hope to be
[4812.88 --> 4815.74]  Jesus all for Jesus
[4815.74 --> 4834.38]  Jesus all for Jesus
[4834.38 --> 4834.80]  Oh Jesus all for Jesus
[4834.80 --> 4835.10]  All for Jesus so I am and have
[4835.10 --> 4846.02]  Just a couple things to note before we receive God's blessing.
[4846.64 --> 4850.00]  The first is, if you're new to Hope, do stick around for the Welcome Lunch.
[4850.16 --> 4851.16]  We want to get to know you.
[4851.30 --> 4852.50]  We want you to get to know us.
[4852.58 --> 4853.68]  And we want you to have a free lunch.
[4853.92 --> 4854.70]  It's a great opportunity.
[4854.86 --> 4855.48]  Get some good soup.
[4855.84 --> 4856.94]  Can you already smell it?
[4856.96 --> 4857.72]  It's going to be amazing.
[4857.90 --> 4858.60]  So stick around.
[4859.02 --> 4862.06]  If you're new-ish, even if you've done one before, you are welcome to have a meal.
[4863.28 --> 4864.48]  Second thing is this.
[4864.48 --> 4868.56]  Next Sunday, we're taking up an offering for what's called our care fund.
[4868.96 --> 4870.22]  Our deacons manage a care fund.
[4870.38 --> 4875.90]  And we love spending that care fund because it takes care of people in our church who are struggling in various ways
[4875.90 --> 4878.58]  and people in our city who are struggling in various ways.
[4878.92 --> 4880.62]  Our deacons know the needs.
[4880.70 --> 4881.50]  And I'm just going to say this.
[4881.72 --> 4884.14]  There are some really serious needs.
[4884.72 --> 4889.72]  And so next week when you come, please do give to that care fund because we're going to use that money to care.
[4889.72 --> 4895.90]  And before you receive the blessing, I'm going to use an illustration that was given to me by a teacher at Regent College.
[4896.56 --> 4899.42]  I had to steal this from my oldest son, Levi, because I never have cash on me.
[4899.48 --> 4900.14]  So there you go.
[4900.30 --> 4902.26]  I stole money from my son for the illustration.
[4903.64 --> 4906.38]  When we give, we are saying at least three things.
[4906.88 --> 4908.14]  The first thing is this.
[4908.14 --> 4911.80]  God, I thank you for providing for me.
[4912.30 --> 4913.34]  You are generous.
[4913.50 --> 4914.22]  My needs are met.
[4914.28 --> 4916.48]  And you are good in every season.
[4917.32 --> 4922.92]  The second thing we're saying when we give is I want to get behind what the church is giving.
[4923.40 --> 4927.62]  I want to get behind the ministry, the needs, and all the stuff that happens in the church.
[4927.70 --> 4929.32]  And this is how I can do it by giving money.
[4929.32 --> 4938.82]  The third thing, perhaps most importantly for Western Christians, when we give our money away, we are saying to our money, you are not my boss.
[4939.48 --> 4941.06]  You do not control who I am.
[4941.16 --> 4943.64]  You are a tool for the kingdom of God.
[4944.70 --> 4948.18]  So in light of that, I want us to receive a blessing that comes from Ephesians 3.
[4948.30 --> 4950.34]  It's a prayer of Paul's over the church.
[4950.34 --> 4956.66]  For this reason, I kneel before the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth derive its name.
[4957.14 --> 4963.00]  I pray that out of his glorious riches, and I tell you, God does have glorious riches,
[4963.72 --> 4970.40]  he may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[4970.92 --> 4976.82]  And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power together with all the Lord's people
[4976.82 --> 4982.96]  to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,
[4983.54 --> 4989.66]  and to know that this love surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
