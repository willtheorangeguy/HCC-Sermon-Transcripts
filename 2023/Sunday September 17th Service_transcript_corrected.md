[0.00 → 7.08] Well, good morning, Hope.
[7.26 → 9.30] I just see a lot of new faces.
[10.02 → 12.92] I want to say welcome to those of us who are here for the first time.
[13.38 → 14.42] I'm Dave Green.
[14.46 → 16.62] I'm one of the pastors here, and it's a privilege to worship.
[16.76 → 19.28] And I want to say thank you to our worship team for leading us this morning.
[20.46 → 26.54] If you don't know, today we are spending time and taking time to commission our new elders and deacons.
[26.54 → 32.00] You should know that in our church, we have a board of elders, and we have deacons who are leaders in our church.
[32.58 → 39.68] And this morning, we take time to pray God's blessing over them, to remind our church and our leaders the responsibility it is to lead.
[39.82 → 43.48] And so I'm going to say just a few words about the role of our elders and deacons.
[43.56 → 48.64] And I'm going to invite our new elders and deacons up to this stage and say a few words of commissioning to them.
[50.34 → 54.66] It's important to know that churches, healthy churches, always have healthy leaders.
[54.66 → 59.72] And Jesus has a few strong words of how we are to lead.
[60.14 → 65.34] In fact, I want to read for us as a way of framing leadership, words from Jesus in Matthew 20, 26 to 28,
[66.10 → 67.12] where he says to us,
[67.12 → 71.10] Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.
[72.20 → 76.18] And whoever wants to be first among you must be a servant.
[76.74 → 83.06] Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and give his life as a ransom for many.
[83.06 → 89.48] We believe for all of us as leaders, staff, pastors, elders, and deacons, that the vocation of leadership,
[89.64 → 93.92] and I put this bullet here for this very reason, is the towel and basin.
[95.10 → 100.16] In John 13, when Jesus basically, in the upper room, teaching his disciples of what he was going to do,
[100.70 → 101.02] he said,
[101.12 → 103.44] This is what it means to follow me, to wash the feet of the world.
[103.44 → 110.00] And for every leader in this church, we believe that our calling is to wash the feet of our church and our city
[110.00 → 112.10] as we follow the servant way of Jesus.
[112.40 → 115.40] And I want this to be the symbol of our leadership this morning
[115.40 → 117.62] as we talk about what it means to be an elder and a deacon.
[119.40 → 123.48] The elders in our church are entrusted with God's vision for this body.
[124.32 → 127.88] The elders oversee the direction and strive with the guidance of the Holy Spirit
[127.88 → 130.74] to guide our church where we believe God is leading it.
[131.66 → 135.48] The elders ensure, you might say, that we, number one, are faithful in our worship.
[136.22 → 138.78] Number two, are biblical in our teaching and our preaching.
[139.24 → 142.60] And we are intentional in our discipleship and our mission.
[143.58 → 145.70] And it might be helpful also to say that as pastors,
[146.10 → 148.94] we are in our denomination accountable to the elders.
[149.58 → 152.06] They are the ones that we must give an account to in our life,
[152.16 → 154.46] in our doctrine, in the way we lead as pastors as well.
[154.46 → 160.58] Our deacons are called to serve the church through the ministry of mercy and care.
[160.80 → 162.42] And not just the church, but also the community.
[163.14 → 165.30] Our deacons are called to know where the needs are,
[166.06 → 170.12] to exercise hospitality and walk with those who are hurting.
[170.72 → 172.84] They pray for the body, intercede for the body,
[172.90 → 177.02] and offer resources to those who are in need, whatever those needs may be.
[178.46 → 182.02] All of these leaders offer themselves as servants to God for the blessing of the church
[182.02 → 184.90] and for the building up of the good in our city.
[185.60 → 188.34] At this point now, I want to invite all of our new office bearers
[188.34 → 192.22] who have been elected into these positions to come up here on the stage with me.
[192.30 → 193.62] In fact, I'll invite you to the centre.
[198.16 → 199.78] I'll say their names once they're up here.
[199.94 → 200.62] Come right up here.
[200.66 → 201.28] You guys have the middle.
[201.28 → 208.56] In fact, I'm going to get you to say your own names
[208.56 → 211.44] and the position that you are being elected into.
[212.02 → 217.12] My name is Mae Baldy, and I've been elected as an elder.
[218.80 → 222.02] My name is Grace Broker, and I've been elected as a deacon.
[223.90 → 225.80] I'm Boris Damaged, and I'm elected as a deacon.
[226.90 → 229.12] I'm Brad Rebel, and I've been elected as an elder.
[230.58 → 232.66] I'm James Parr, and I've been elected as an elder.
[233.76 → 235.86] I'm Shinny Kang, and I serve as a deacon.
[235.86 → 245.44] Just as a personal note, one of the things that I was encouraged by in my conversations
[245.44 → 248.60] with you leading up to your commissioning, but also in the discernment,
[249.06 → 251.08] is the serious way in which you discern this calling.
[251.28 → 253.60] You know, it's a big deal to have leaders of the church say,
[253.72 → 256.44] hey, we've heard from the body, and we've been discerning,
[256.50 → 259.28] and we believe this is an area where you can be serving with your gifts.
[259.68 → 262.30] And to hear the prayerful discernment, and that you're here this morning,
[262.30 → 265.70] is a real gift to our church, and I appreciate the way in which you've taken it seriously.
[266.54 → 270.08] I want to read a scripture that is actually directed in 1 Timothy 3
[270.08 → 273.16] towards the overseers, the elders, the deacons, and pastors.
[274.30 → 276.90] And I have a feeling it's going to hit you the same way it hits me.
[277.86 → 280.12] Here is a trustworthy saying that you can trust.
[280.70 → 282.40] If anyone wants to be a leader in the church,
[282.86 → 285.34] he wants to do good work for God and God's people.
[286.14 → 289.78] A leader must be free from blame, faithful to his wife.
[289.78 → 292.36] In anything he does, he must not go too far.
[293.20 → 295.68] He must control himself, be worthy of respect,
[296.10 → 298.80] must welcome people to his home, be able to teach,
[299.18 → 303.56] must not get drunk, not push people around, but must be gentle.
[304.22 → 308.10] He must be a person who does not like to argue and not love money.
[308.98 → 310.54] He must manage his own family well,
[311.00 → 313.96] making sure that his children obey him and show him proper respect.
[314.16 → 316.68] Suppose someone doesn't know how to manage their own family.
[316.78 → 318.66] How can they take care of God's church?
[318.66 → 320.98] The leader must not be a new believer.
[321.28 → 322.68] If he is, he might become proud.
[322.92 → 324.60] Then he would be judged just like the devil.
[325.20 → 328.72] The leader must also be respected by those who are outside the church.
[329.38 → 332.50] Then they will not be put to shame and fall into the devil's trap.
[333.68 → 336.40] Deacons, likewise, must be worthy of respect.
[336.98 → 339.86] They must be honest and true, not drink too much wine,
[340.30 → 342.20] must not try to get money by cheating people.
[342.20 → 345.62] They must hold on to the deep truths of the faith.
[346.26 → 349.70] Even their own minds tell them to do that.
[350.54 → 354.72] First they must be tested, then let them serve as a deacon if there is nothing against them.
[356.18 → 357.24] Now tell me I'm wrong.
[357.30 → 358.48] You feel a bit overwhelmed by that.
[359.82 → 360.70] I do too.
[360.70 → 364.22] And there's a sense in which you look at that list, and you're like,
[364.32 → 367.12] whew, I don't think any of us are qualified for these positions.
[367.24 → 367.90] And that is true.
[368.24 → 369.88] We're on the journey of faith.
[370.58 → 373.76] And yet we truly do see as a body of leaders that God has gifted you,
[374.32 → 375.42] he has matured you,
[375.66 → 381.40] and he will use you to bless and build up and lead well as a servant this church that God has put in this city.
[381.40 → 387.80] Boris, Grace, Shine, Brad, May, and James,
[388.76 → 392.14] you're being called in this position not just by a body of believers but by the Lord
[392.14 → 395.62] to honour and serve him as you serve this church.
[396.22 → 399.66] And the way we do that, just to remind us again,
[400.66 → 401.78] is by getting low,
[402.34 → 405.76] by entering in with humility as servants,
[406.46 → 409.98] being dependent not on your own strength but on God's strength through prayer
[409.98 → 412.14] and dedication to his word.
[412.64 → 414.14] And you can trust that the Spirit,
[414.70 → 416.40] the same Spirit who raised Christ from the dead,
[416.48 → 419.32] will empower you and enable you to serve this body well.
[421.36 → 423.54] To express your acceptance of this calling,
[423.66 → 425.40] I'm going to ask you a set of four questions.
[426.06 → 427.84] And in the presence of God and our church,
[428.26 → 431.48] to respond, I do God helping me after I've asked those questions.
[432.66 → 436.36] Number one, do you believe that this call to serve our congregation, this body,
[436.80 → 439.64] is God's call in your life and thus a holy responsibility?
[440.88 → 443.52] Secondly, do you believe that by the guidance of God's word
[443.52 → 445.02] and through deep and constant prayer,
[445.32 → 446.74] by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[446.82 → 449.18] you will be equipped to serve?
[450.54 → 452.90] Thirdly, do you promise to do this work of God humbly,
[453.78 → 455.10] diligently, and faithfully,
[455.64 → 458.80] striving to lead where God leads you and our body?
[459.92 → 462.96] Boris, Brad, May, Grace, and Shine,
[463.38 → 464.42] what is your answer?
[464.42 → 467.44] I do, God helping me.
[467.82 → 468.18] Amen.
[468.90 → 470.48] I do, God helping me.
[471.64 → 472.96] I do, God helping me.
[474.32 → 475.68] I do, God helping me.
[478.26 → 479.90] I do, God helping me.
[482.96 → 484.18] I do, God helping me.
[484.58 → 485.80] You had me nervous there, James.
[485.80 → 497.96] I invite you now, as our body of believers,
[498.02 → 498.96] I have a question for you.
[499.62 → 501.26] As you invite these leaders to lead us,
[501.26 → 503.62] would you stand, as I have a question for us as the body?
[508.08 → 510.30] Brothers and sisters of Hope Community Church,
[510.30 → 513.14] will you receive each one of these people
[513.14 → 515.78] as leaders and servants in our church,
[516.10 → 518.28] as Christ's gift to this body?
[518.36 → 519.46] Will you uphold them in prayer,
[520.10 → 521.68] encourage them, and join them
[521.68 → 524.42] in the work of ministry in this season?
[524.60 → 525.42] What is your answer?
[526.32 → 527.76] We do, God helping us.
[528.18 → 528.44] Amen.
[528.60 → 529.14] You may be seated.
[532.50 → 533.48] Now, in just a moment,
[533.58 → 534.64] we're going to pray for these leaders,
[534.80 → 536.06] and I'm going to ask you to extend your arm
[536.06 → 536.66] and pray with me,
[536.74 → 538.82] but I want to say a word of gratitude.
[541.10 → 543.32] God has been so gracious to us over the years,
[543.44 → 545.88] each season providing us leaders who are servants,
[546.56 → 547.54] and we have a number of leaders
[547.54 → 549.72] who are now finishing their season of serving at Hope
[549.72 → 551.64] in the roles of elder and deacon,
[551.70 → 552.52] and I want to name them,
[552.58 → 554.28] and if you're here, I want you to stand up.
[554.36 → 556.04] Dave and Rhonda Herod, I don't think they're here.
[556.46 → 558.32] Sean Hamelin, you're here, I saw you.
[558.34 → 558.96] You stand up.
[560.52 → 563.98] Sandy Purée, Jason Van Toll, where are you?
[564.18 → 565.74] He's probably helping with the barbecue right now.
[566.86 → 568.38] Well, Sean, I'm just going to single you right out.
[568.38 → 570.40] No pressure.
[571.08 → 571.88] You've been a gift.
[572.54 → 573.52] You have served faithfully,
[574.04 → 575.80] humbly, lovingly, selflessly,
[576.28 → 577.68] and I want to say that of all those,
[577.82 → 579.30] most of whom are at the 9 a.m. service,
[579.42 → 581.24] that you have been a gift to our church and to our body,
[581.36 → 583.60] and we are thankful for the way
[583.60 → 584.78] you finished this season well.
[585.34 → 587.56] Let's give Sean and the others a round of applause.
[587.56 → 589.56] Thank you.
[598.20 → 600.74] It's worth noting that those who are finishing their term,
[601.04 → 603.44] they will always have on their record as serving
[603.44 → 605.30] as they had to deal with COVID.
[606.36 → 607.56] That's a unique challenge.
[607.66 → 609.16] I remember as a leadership body saying,
[609.34 → 611.52] what in the world do we do as a body of believers
[611.52 → 612.28] in this season?
[612.28 → 615.70] And Sean and Sandy and Jason and Dave and Rhonda
[615.70 → 617.56] were a gift of discernment in that season.
[619.00 → 621.20] But now let's pray for those who are entering
[621.20 → 622.38] into this season of service.
[622.50 → 624.30] And again, extend your arm with me,
[624.38 → 626.96] and we're going to pray a blessing over our office bearers.
[626.96 → 633.22] Father, we thank you for your faithfulness to our church.
[634.04 → 636.28] We think of the elders and deacons who have served,
[636.38 → 638.60] and now these people who are stepping into this role
[638.60 → 639.84] as elder and deacon,
[640.36 → 642.78] roles that you have established to lead your church well.
[643.52 → 646.78] Would you grant them all they need to serve our body?
[647.64 → 649.28] Would you be at work in their lives,
[650.00 → 652.18] their marriages, their families,
[652.68 → 655.50] giving them a devotion to you and your word?
[655.50 → 657.48] Would you fill them with your spirit
[657.48 → 659.76] so that their leadership brings you glory,
[660.46 → 661.54] equips your church,
[662.20 → 663.32] serves this community,
[663.52 → 665.32] and blesses the city?
[665.96 → 667.52] To Jesus Christ be the glory.
[667.90 → 668.14] Amen.
[670.16 → 671.46] I am looking forward to,
[671.48 → 673.46] and I say this on behalf of all of our staff and leaders,
[673.58 → 674.80] we are very much looking forward
[674.80 → 676.30] to serving this community together
[676.30 → 677.60] and for the way that your gifts
[677.60 → 679.18] will be put to good work for God's kingdom.
[679.78 → 680.34] Thank you.
[680.34 → 681.34] Thank you.
[681.34 → 682.18] Thank you.
[685.50 → 686.00] Thank you.
[690.46 → 692.20] This time I'm going to invite Ken Nonchalant
[692.20 → 693.86] to lead us in a community prayer.
[693.86 → 705.00] Thank you, Pastor Dave.
[705.04 → 706.86] And before we do our community prayer,
[706.92 → 708.06] I'm just going to ask all those
[708.06 → 710.12] who are age three to grade three
[710.12 → 712.46] to join our wonderful Cornerstone program.
[712.92 → 714.86] The stampede can start towards the back.
[716.00 → 717.74] Great program planned for you.
[717.74 → 722.64] We're so thankful for all those who serve
[722.64 → 724.28] in looking after our little ones
[724.28 → 726.38] and helping them to get to know God.
[729.86 → 731.34] For those of you who don't know me,
[731.42 → 732.76] my name is Ken Nonchalant,
[732.92 → 735.66] and my wife Sandy and I have been members here
[735.66 → 738.68] for close to 20 years now, I think.
[738.80 → 740.42] And it's been a beautiful place to worship
[740.42 → 743.22] and to serve together with the rest of you.
[743.22 → 746.08] Every week I come, I see new faces,
[746.46 → 749.14] and it'd be great to get to know those who are new.
[749.78 → 752.36] And that's also why I'm reintroducing myself,
[752.54 → 753.88] even though I've been here for a long time.
[754.84 → 755.98] And we're looking forward as well
[755.98 → 757.86] to the community picnic today or the barbecue
[757.86 → 760.28] and getting to know each other even a bit better there.
[761.36 → 763.86] So prayer is central to what we do here
[763.86 → 765.02] at Hope Community Church.
[765.44 → 767.24] And leadership's been talking recently
[767.24 → 769.72] about how we can even make that more central
[769.72 → 771.44] to what we do together.
[771.44 → 775.60] and it should permeate all the activities
[775.60 → 777.28] that we have in all of our ministries.
[777.46 → 778.40] We're thinking about it,
[778.54 → 780.64] especially in the context of our worship service.
[781.20 → 782.64] And so you'll notice that
[782.64 → 785.44] we have incorporated confessional prayer
[785.44 → 786.86] into the worship part,
[787.02 → 788.50] which I think is really important
[788.50 → 791.38] and a wonderful thing that we'll try and do every week.
[791.94 → 794.78] We also meet for prayer before the service.
[794.78 → 797.72] So at 8.45, and all are welcome to join us.
[798.08 → 799.08] We have a time to pray
[799.08 → 801.64] and just pray that God would bless all the elements
[801.64 → 803.24] of the morning worship service
[803.24 → 805.96] and that his presence would really be felt here.
[806.92 → 808.96] And then we have this thing we're doing now,
[809.04 → 810.78] which is called community prayer.
[810.92 → 813.64] And community prayer is really designed primarily
[813.64 → 816.20] to be about intercession
[816.20 → 818.62] or praying for the needs that we have
[818.62 → 819.98] and really the needs of the world
[819.98 → 822.16] and our neighbours as a whole.
[822.16 → 824.68] And so when I learned that
[824.68 → 826.52] and we sort of reframed what we're doing here,
[826.60 → 828.00] I thought, hey, that's great.
[828.04 → 828.68] That's a bit simpler.
[829.14 → 831.78] Like I just have to focus on intercessory prayer.
[831.96 → 833.16] Yeah, I've got this.
[834.46 → 835.76] And then I turned on the TV
[835.76 → 837.20] and I looked at the news.
[837.82 → 840.10] And you look at what's going on in our world
[840.10 → 841.40] and you see the brokenness
[841.40 → 843.42] and the suffering and the discord
[843.42 → 845.16] and it gets a little overwhelming.
[846.92 → 848.28] Sandy and I were invited this week
[848.28 → 850.32] to something called the Red Mass.
[850.92 → 852.50] So the Red Mass is a special service
[852.50 → 855.22] held each year to uphold Catholic lawyers
[855.22 → 858.04] and judges, others engaged in the judicial system.
[858.82 → 860.20] At the dinner that followed,
[860.74 → 863.08] Premier David By was invited to speak.
[863.50 → 865.06] And I thought it was quite brave of him
[865.06 → 868.46] to come and address a group of Christian lawyers
[868.46 → 870.38] and others engaged in the justice system.
[871.62 → 873.38] He shared his thoughts and his challenges
[873.38 → 875.64] of being in charge of our province
[875.64 → 877.64] and putting out fires.
[878.28 → 881.24] You know, literally and also figuratively
[881.24 → 883.42] and the many challenges that he had.
[883.86 → 885.46] He also at the end of his talk said,
[885.80 → 887.84] you know, I'm very seldom invited
[887.84 → 890.26] to speak to groups of Christians.
[890.96 → 893.24] And I felt pretty convicted by that as well.
[894.04 → 895.56] We want to uphold our leaders
[895.56 → 897.08] and those that are having to deal
[897.08 → 898.24] with the many challenges
[898.24 → 901.02] right in our own neighbourhoods.
[902.76 → 904.38] I also felt pretty overwhelmed.
[904.54 → 905.94] So between the news and listening to him
[905.94 → 907.42] talk about the challenges in the provinces,
[907.42 → 909.88] I thought, you know, maybe I don't got this.
[911.06 → 912.66] But then, you know, the Lord comes along
[912.66 → 913.58] as he always does.
[914.04 → 916.28] And he speaks in some way to me.
[916.34 → 918.02] And as I mentioned many times when I'm up here,
[918.38 → 920.18] he seems to like to use the Bible app
[920.18 → 921.10] to speak to me.
[921.28 → 923.00] And there's this thing called the verse of the day.
[923.10 → 924.30] And so, yeah, wouldn't you know it?
[924.34 → 925.72] I look at my verse of the day
[925.72 → 927.24] when I'm feeling overwhelmed
[927.24 → 929.78] about this role of interceding
[929.78 → 931.16] with all of us
[931.16 → 932.80] for all the problems in our world.
[932.80 → 934.32] And this is what the verse says.
[935.22 → 935.54] Likewise,
[937.26 → 939.88] the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
[940.62 → 943.92] For we do not know what to pray as we ought,
[944.30 → 946.98] but the Spirit himself intercedes for us
[946.98 → 949.66] with groanings too deep for words.
[950.54 → 951.40] And so once again,
[951.52 → 954.54] in his own wonderful way,
[954.94 → 957.12] God reminded me that he's got this.
[957.84 → 958.66] But he invites us.
[958.68 → 959.68] He invites us together
[959.68 → 961.40] to join in community prayer
[961.40 → 962.52] and uphold the needs.
[962.92 → 964.74] And that's something that we can all share.
[964.88 → 966.16] So I invite you to pray with me now.
[970.00 → 970.92] Lord our God,
[971.22 → 972.38] we come to you with,
[973.34 → 973.76] well, yeah,
[973.82 → 974.60] a lot of needs
[974.60 → 976.32] and a lot of problems and issues
[976.32 → 978.04] in our own lives
[978.04 → 979.08] and in the world around us.
[979.14 → 981.18] And all we can do is come before you
[981.18 → 982.38] knowing that you are God
[982.38 → 984.28] and you are ultimately in control
[984.28 → 986.00] and to bring these things before you.
[986.14 → 987.72] And so we do that this morning.
[987.72 → 989.72] We pray for our world, Lord.
[989.80 → 992.02] There's a lot of turmoil and trouble,
[992.52 → 995.02] some of it caused by natural catastrophe,
[995.18 → 999.76] some of it just caused by us being out of sync with you.
[1000.46 → 1001.36] We pray, Lord,
[1001.42 → 1003.38] for rain to put out the fires.
[1004.42 → 1007.16] We pray for the sun to dry out the floods.
[1008.16 → 1010.96] We pray for your peace where there is war.
[1010.96 → 1012.96] We pray for our people.
[1012.96 → 1013.96] We pray for our people.
[1013.96 → 1014.46] We pray for our people.
[1014.46 → 1016.22] We pray for our people to get involved,
[1016.54 → 1017.46] to give,
[1017.84 → 1018.70] to serve,
[1019.04 → 1021.10] and to help our fellow human beings
[1021.10 → 1023.46] who suffer in all of these situations.
[1026.30 → 1027.96] Lord, we pray for this country,
[1028.50 → 1029.58] for our province,
[1029.94 → 1030.88] for our city,
[1031.30 → 1033.70] for the many challenges that we face
[1033.70 → 1035.24] in the communities we live in.
[1035.24 → 1037.58] We pray for our leaders,
[1037.72 → 1039.28] even though we don't always agree
[1039.28 → 1040.26] with what they say
[1040.26 → 1041.92] or the positions they hold.
[1042.54 → 1043.72] Lord, they are in charge,
[1043.80 → 1044.38] and you have told us
[1044.38 → 1045.54] we must uphold our leaders
[1045.54 → 1046.42] and pray for them.
[1046.50 → 1048.12] We pray for Prime Minister Trudeau.
[1048.72 → 1050.72] We pray for Premier David By.
[1051.36 → 1052.88] We pray for our Mayor Locke
[1052.88 → 1054.72] and all of those who serve
[1054.72 → 1055.98] in these communities
[1055.98 → 1058.24] and have given their time
[1058.24 → 1058.84] and their efforts
[1058.84 → 1060.16] to lead us
[1060.16 → 1061.92] and to help with the many issues
[1061.92 → 1063.22] we have in our communities.
[1063.22 → 1067.10] Lord, I pray that you would remind me
[1067.10 → 1068.40] and all of us
[1068.40 → 1070.52] that we ought to pray
[1070.52 → 1072.52] more than we complain
[1072.52 → 1074.56] about these in leadership.
[1075.92 → 1077.16] We pray for this church.
[1077.30 → 1078.56] We thank you for this church.
[1078.94 → 1079.82] We thank you for a place
[1079.82 → 1080.88] that we can come in freedom
[1080.88 → 1081.80] to worship you
[1081.80 → 1083.30] and to pray to you
[1083.30 → 1084.62] and to be encouraged
[1084.62 → 1085.62] and hear your word.
[1086.44 → 1087.54] Pray, Lord, for the leaders
[1087.54 → 1088.18] of this church.
[1088.28 → 1089.10] We thank you again
[1089.10 → 1090.30] for those who are now serving.
[1091.08 → 1091.88] Be with our elders,
[1092.04 → 1092.58] our deacons,
[1092.58 → 1093.94] as they together gather
[1093.94 → 1095.36] and think about
[1095.36 → 1096.28] how to lead us.
[1097.00 → 1097.86] Give them wisdom
[1097.86 → 1098.72] in their decisions.
[1099.34 → 1100.00] Help them, Lord,
[1100.08 → 1102.22] to help us remain unified
[1102.22 → 1103.52] in pursuing the things
[1103.52 → 1104.46] that truly matter
[1104.46 → 1105.98] and bring you
[1105.98 → 1106.86] and your love
[1106.86 → 1107.38] to the neighbourhood
[1107.38 → 1108.14] around us.
[1109.42 → 1110.58] Father, I pray as well
[1110.58 → 1111.72] that you would stir us
[1111.72 → 1112.64] to get involved,
[1113.00 → 1114.48] get involved in our communities
[1114.48 → 1117.36] to bring your spirit
[1117.36 → 1118.10] to the places
[1118.10 → 1119.14] that we can serve you.
[1119.52 → 1120.38] Thank you for the gifts
[1120.38 → 1121.02] you've given us.
[1121.02 → 1121.98] Help us to get involved
[1121.98 → 1122.84] in our ministries
[1122.84 → 1124.32] here in this church
[1124.32 → 1125.88] and to serve each other gladly.
[1126.50 → 1127.26] And thank you
[1127.26 → 1128.20] for answering
[1128.20 → 1129.48] all of our prayers.
[1130.44 → 1131.50] We pray especially now
[1131.50 → 1132.52] for Pastor Dave
[1132.52 → 1133.80] as he brings the word to us.
[1134.24 → 1135.12] Ask that we would
[1135.12 → 1136.76] receive what you have to say,
[1136.84 → 1138.14] that it would go deep
[1138.14 → 1139.38] and that it would change us, Lord,
[1139.44 → 1140.74] that we would leave this place
[1140.74 → 1142.72] changed and closer to you.
[1143.68 → 1145.10] Thank you for hearing our prayer.
[1145.50 → 1146.84] In Jesus' name, amen.
[1146.84 → 1146.94] Amen.
[1148.62 → 1149.80] Just want to remind you as well,
[1149.88 → 1150.88] there are different ways
[1150.88 → 1151.76] in which you can help
[1151.76 → 1153.06] to give to support
[1153.06 → 1154.38] the ministries of this church.
[1155.42 → 1157.28] There is an app,
[1157.40 → 1158.34] the Church Centre app,
[1158.40 → 1159.80] that you can take advantage
[1159.80 → 1160.48] of for giving.
[1160.62 → 1161.08] And also,
[1161.66 → 1163.22] we have a debit machine
[1163.22 → 1164.72] that is by the coffee station
[1164.72 → 1165.22] in the back,
[1165.60 → 1166.90] also an opportunity for giving
[1166.90 → 1167.88] to continue to support
[1167.88 → 1169.16] all the ministries
[1169.16 → 1169.78] of our church.
[1170.00 → 1170.36] Thank you.
[1170.36 → 1183.68] Well, in true Dave Groen fashion,
[1183.78 → 1184.88] I forgot one of our deacons
[1184.88 → 1185.62] who finished serving.
[1185.76 → 1186.46] Is Warren here?
[1188.44 → 1189.88] Warren was a gift as well.
[1191.06 → 1192.68] His service mattered
[1192.68 → 1193.38] in this church.
[1194.28 → 1195.32] And I didn't want him to think
[1195.32 → 1196.72] I excluded him on purpose.
[1196.86 → 1197.46] He was a blessing.
[1197.46 → 1200.02] We are beginning
[1200.02 → 1201.14] a new sermon series
[1201.14 → 1201.98] this morning.
[1202.94 → 1204.72] After a number of weeks
[1204.72 → 1205.94] looking at the story
[1205.94 → 1206.46] of the Bible,
[1206.64 → 1207.62] the story of our culture,
[1207.90 → 1209.00] the mission of the church,
[1209.40 → 1210.26] we thought it would be fitting
[1210.26 → 1212.32] to zero in very specifically
[1212.32 → 1213.62] on the way we live
[1213.62 → 1214.76] in the biblical story
[1214.76 → 1216.24] and live out the gospel
[1216.24 → 1217.70] in our homes.
[1217.92 → 1218.58] And so the series
[1218.58 → 1219.72] is called Homegrown.
[1219.78 → 1220.70] And I want to say thank you
[1220.70 → 1221.62] to our decor team.
[1221.70 → 1222.32] You can see how they made
[1222.32 → 1223.92] front doors as the home theme.
[1224.36 → 1225.02] And our banner,
[1225.20 → 1226.02] our Hope Art Collective,
[1226.02 → 1227.22] there's a lot of creative
[1227.22 → 1228.58] details that you should
[1228.58 → 1229.18] come up closer
[1229.18 → 1229.96] to take a look at.
[1230.18 → 1231.48] The only detail I take issue
[1231.48 → 1232.84] with is that the Sky Train is,
[1232.96 → 1233.92] you can see our church there
[1233.92 → 1234.28] by the way.
[1234.86 → 1235.96] Sky Train's going to be
[1235.96 → 1236.58] in our city,
[1236.66 → 1237.16] but it's actually going to be
[1237.16 → 1238.22] a lot closer to our church
[1238.22 → 1239.28] than that piece of art depicts.
[1239.44 → 1241.22] So take a look at that art,
[1241.36 → 1242.44] enjoy the gift of our own
[1242.44 → 1243.36] neighbourhood being depicted,
[1243.60 → 1244.04] and thank you,
[1244.08 → 1244.80] Hope Art Collective.
[1245.64 → 1247.34] For the next six to seven weeks,
[1247.56 → 1248.22] we're going to be looking
[1248.22 → 1250.32] at marriage, parenting,
[1251.42 → 1254.86] hospitality, work, money,
[1255.68 → 1256.52] and Sabbath.
[1257.26 → 1259.18] The regular, ordinary rhythms
[1259.18 → 1261.62] of our homes that form our hearts
[1261.62 → 1263.28] in one way or another.
[1264.30 → 1265.08] And if you have your Bible,
[1265.16 → 1266.26] I do invite you to turn with me
[1266.26 → 1267.58] to Matthew chapter 22,
[1268.26 → 1268.86] and we're going to read
[1268.86 → 1269.90] what is often described
[1269.90 → 1271.76] as the greatest commandment.
[1273.08 → 1276.32] It's Matthew 22, verse 34 to 39.
[1276.32 → 1281.74] Hearing that Jesus had silenced
[1281.74 → 1282.72] the Sadducee's,
[1282.96 → 1284.36] the Pharisees got together.
[1285.12 → 1286.62] One of them, an expert in the law,
[1286.74 → 1288.30] tested him with this question.
[1289.08 → 1291.16] Teacher, what is the greatest
[1291.16 → 1292.48] commandment in the law?
[1293.76 → 1294.58] Jesus replied,
[1294.96 → 1296.12] Love the Lord your God
[1296.12 → 1297.18] with all your heart,
[1297.88 → 1299.04] with all your soul,
[1299.56 → 1300.82] and with all your mind.
[1300.82 → 1302.38] This is the first
[1302.38 → 1304.12] and greatest commandment.
[1304.50 → 1305.76] And the second is like it.
[1306.32 → 1308.32] Love your neighbour as yourself.
[1309.18 → 1311.10] All the law and the prophets
[1311.10 → 1313.76] hang on these two commandments.
[1319.04 → 1320.40] Well, a few years ago,
[1320.52 → 1321.02] Brittany and me,
[1321.12 → 1321.90] along with our family,
[1321.98 → 1323.42] were visiting Ontario,
[1323.60 → 1324.28] our family there.
[1324.88 → 1326.66] And I had one particular afternoon
[1326.66 → 1327.54] where it was just me
[1327.54 → 1328.36] and Levi and Adele,
[1328.42 → 1329.08] my two oldest,
[1329.08 → 1330.72] and I had a whole afternoon free,
[1330.90 → 1332.46] and an idea popped in my head
[1332.46 → 1333.60] that I could not let go.
[1334.24 → 1335.30] And that idea was
[1335.30 → 1336.60] to pack my kids in the car
[1336.60 → 1338.82] and drive about 10 minutes away
[1338.82 → 1340.12] to visit the farmhouse
[1340.12 → 1341.16] that I grew up in.
[1342.22 → 1343.30] And so that's exactly what we did.
[1343.34 → 1343.86] We drove there.
[1343.92 → 1344.66] And the original goal
[1344.66 → 1345.86] was just to do a drive-by.
[1346.22 → 1347.74] But as I got closer to the house,
[1347.80 → 1349.22] I was mustering up the courage
[1349.22 → 1350.58] to park in the parking lot
[1350.58 → 1351.64] and knock on the door
[1351.64 → 1352.92] and just see what happens.
[1353.56 → 1354.88] So that's exactly what we did.
[1354.98 → 1356.12] 25 years or so
[1356.12 → 1357.82] after being in that home myself,
[1358.26 → 1359.14] there I was standing
[1359.14 → 1360.02] on the front steps
[1360.02 → 1361.28] knocking on a door
[1361.28 → 1362.36] of the childhood home.
[1363.00 → 1364.04] And an elderly woman
[1364.04 → 1364.82] came to the door
[1364.82 → 1367.02] with a great degree of suspicion.
[1368.26 → 1369.74] And I introduced myself,
[1369.88 → 1370.82] I introduced my kids,
[1370.88 → 1372.42] I think they really helped the cause.
[1372.68 → 1373.70] And she asked
[1373.70 → 1374.74] I was hoping she would ask.
[1374.78 → 1375.14] She said,
[1375.24 → 1376.32] would you like to come in
[1376.32 → 1377.08] and take a look?
[1377.56 → 1378.48] I said, absolutely.
[1379.22 → 1380.70] And I have so much respect for her
[1380.70 → 1381.72] because just imagine for a minute
[1381.72 → 1382.94] someone just walks to your house
[1382.94 → 1383.32] and they say,
[1383.38 → 1384.72] can I take a look around your house?
[1385.20 → 1385.94] And so we went
[1385.94 → 1387.02] for about 20 minutes,
[1387.24 → 1388.10] room by room,
[1388.10 → 1389.02] upstairs and down
[1389.02 → 1390.60] and she just showed me the space
[1390.60 → 1391.48] and remarkably,
[1391.76 → 1392.70] very little had changed.
[1393.06 → 1394.22] It felt like a time capsule
[1394.22 → 1396.12] except maybe everything felt smaller
[1396.12 → 1397.30] because I had gotten taller.
[1398.60 → 1400.44] But it was a massive trip
[1400.44 → 1401.46] down memory lane for me.
[1401.54 → 1401.70] You know,
[1401.78 → 1403.08] walking through what we called
[1403.08 → 1404.00] the rec room then
[1404.00 → 1405.40] and thinking about
[1405.40 → 1406.56] all the memories of my brothers
[1406.56 → 1407.64] doing what they called
[1407.64 → 1408.38] ninja lessons.
[1408.84 → 1409.30] You know, karate,
[1409.42 → 1410.76] the first karate kid was out then
[1410.76 → 1411.66] and that's where they got to
[1411.66 → 1412.92] beat us up and call it lessons.
[1413.56 → 1414.86] And walking through the kitchen
[1414.86 → 1416.02] just remembering all these
[1416.02 → 1417.78] incredibly loud family meals.
[1417.78 → 1418.92] I'm a family of seven.
[1419.20 → 1420.24] I have four brothers,
[1420.36 → 1420.88] no sisters.
[1421.36 → 1422.58] And whenever people hear that,
[1422.68 → 1423.78] the first thing they say is,
[1423.90 → 1425.04] you're a poor mother.
[1425.64 → 1426.24] And it's true.
[1427.18 → 1428.16] But that experience,
[1428.28 → 1429.08] walking through the home
[1429.08 → 1430.50] just solidified for me,
[1430.70 → 1431.68] and you've probably had this,
[1432.24 → 1435.54] how deeply formative a home is.
[1436.82 → 1438.96] Like, so many memories,
[1439.42 → 1440.78] so many experience,
[1441.20 → 1443.38] such deep formation.
[1443.38 → 1446.08] It is most likely the case
[1446.08 → 1447.22] that there's no place
[1447.22 → 1448.08] that will form you
[1448.08 → 1448.90] more than your home.
[1449.48 → 1451.34] You will have some of your best
[1451.34 → 1452.14] core memories,
[1452.24 → 1453.54] some of the most cherished moments
[1453.54 → 1454.52] you hope to never forget,
[1454.90 → 1456.62] and you will have some
[1456.62 → 1457.42] of the deepest hurt
[1457.42 → 1460.02] and the most challenging relationships
[1460.02 → 1461.26] under that roof.
[1461.34 → 1462.42] That's the most likely scenario.
[1462.50 → 1464.34] We are formed most deeply,
[1464.46 → 1465.78] for better and for worse,
[1466.28 → 1468.00] by life at home.
[1468.00 → 1470.76] Now, a few years ago,
[1470.80 → 1471.98] I came across this piece of art.
[1472.06 → 1473.04] Actually, someone did not
[1473.04 → 1473.60] give this to me.
[1473.68 → 1474.22] This is something
[1474.22 → 1475.34] that someone showed to me.
[1475.72 → 1476.92] It's by Karen Payton,
[1477.26 → 1478.92] and it's called Rumours of Glory.
[1479.06 → 1480.10] Now, Karen is a believer.
[1480.38 → 1481.24] She does prayer walks.
[1481.44 → 1482.40] She's a Canadian, actually.
[1482.86 → 1483.56] She does prayer walks
[1483.56 → 1484.14] in her neighbourhood,
[1484.24 → 1484.84] and after doing that
[1484.84 → 1485.64] for a long season,
[1485.74 → 1487.62] she actually painted this piece
[1487.62 → 1489.56] to depict the different experiences
[1489.56 → 1490.94] that people have in their homes.
[1491.00 → 1491.52] And you'll see,
[1491.80 → 1493.14] there's a wide range, right?
[1493.20 → 1493.70] On the left,
[1494.34 → 1495.94] you'll see an elderly woman lonely.
[1495.94 → 1496.80] You'll see intimacy
[1496.80 → 1497.76] with the family.
[1498.02 → 1499.12] You'll see conflict,
[1499.38 → 1500.00] even abuse.
[1500.58 → 1501.92] You'll see disconnection
[1501.92 → 1503.30] and conflict on the right,
[1503.42 → 1504.46] and then even isolation,
[1505.38 → 1506.70] maybe entrapment of sorts
[1506.70 → 1507.40] in that one home.
[1507.46 → 1509.06] And then just to the right of centre,
[1509.18 → 1510.54] there is someone crying out to God,
[1510.62 → 1512.60] an intercessor for the neighbourhood.
[1513.62 → 1514.26] But I think that's
[1514.26 → 1515.34] a realistic depiction
[1515.34 → 1518.16] of the many experiences of homes,
[1518.52 → 1520.26] the heartbreak and the tenderness,
[1520.82 → 1522.38] the joy and the deep sorrow
[1522.38 → 1525.28] that experiences in our homes.
[1525.68 → 1526.58] And here's the question.
[1526.80 → 1527.74] that I want to ask everyone
[1527.74 → 1529.52] as we begin this whole sermon series.
[1530.34 → 1531.86] What is your home like?
[1533.74 → 1535.38] What words would you describe
[1535.38 → 1537.84] the atmosphere of your home with?
[1538.50 → 1539.78] And maybe even more pointedly,
[1539.90 → 1540.82] what kind of people
[1540.82 → 1541.82] are being formed
[1541.82 → 1544.74] in the place you call home?
[1546.66 → 1548.08] James K. Smith wrote a book
[1548.08 → 1549.32] called You Are What You Love.
[1549.64 → 1550.22] And in that book,
[1550.28 → 1551.26] he wrote a whole section
[1551.26 → 1552.90] on the atmosphere of a home.
[1552.94 → 1553.74] And I want to read
[1553.74 → 1555.26] a bit of an extended quote from him
[1555.26 → 1556.80] that I think gets exactly
[1556.80 → 1557.72] about what we want to do
[1557.72 → 1558.64] in this sermon series.
[1558.80 → 1559.30] He writes,
[1559.30 → 1562.32] How can a home be a place
[1562.32 → 1564.52] to recalibrate our hearts?
[1565.64 → 1567.54] It means that we should be concerned
[1567.54 → 1569.58] with the ethos of our households,
[1569.82 → 1572.28] the unspoken vibe carried out
[1572.28 → 1573.52] in a time that is attuned
[1573.52 → 1575.32] to some and some goal.
[1576.16 → 1577.68] We need to tune our homes
[1577.68 → 1578.86] and thus our hearts
[1578.86 → 1580.60] to sing his grace.
[1581.74 → 1583.30] That tuning requires intentionality
[1583.92 → 1585.10] with regard to the hum,
[1585.10 → 1586.88] the constant background noise
[1586.88 → 1588.86] generated by our routines and rhythms.
[1589.54 → 1590.56] Here's the challenging part.
[1591.02 → 1592.88] You could have Bible inputs every day
[1592.88 → 1594.08] and still have a household
[1594.08 → 1595.46] whose frantic rhythms
[1595.46 → 1596.74] are humming along
[1596.74 → 1598.28] with the consumerist myth
[1598.28 → 1599.96] of productivity and consumption.
[1600.62 → 1602.00] You might have Bible verses
[1602.00 → 1604.60] on the wall of every room in the house,
[1604.98 → 1606.70] and yet the unspoken rituals
[1606.70 → 1608.78] reinforce self-centredness
[1608.78 → 1610.36] rather than sacrifice.
[1611.26 → 1613.30] Each household and family
[1613.30 → 1614.72] does well to take an audit
[1614.72 → 1615.96] of its daily routines.
[1616.96 → 1619.22] What story is being carried
[1619.22 → 1619.90] in those rhythms?
[1620.56 → 1621.98] What vision of the good life
[1621.98 → 1623.34] is carried in those practices?
[1624.04 → 1625.60] What sorts of people
[1625.60 → 1628.28] are made by immersion
[1628.28 → 1629.24] in these spaces?
[1630.40 → 1631.44] That's the question
[1631.44 → 1632.62] we want to ask
[1632.62 → 1633.84] in this sermon series.
[1635.90 → 1636.88] You should know
[1636.88 → 1638.00] that we live in a culture
[1638.00 → 1639.56] that's very interested in homes.
[1640.24 → 1641.36] In fact, if you have cable TV
[1641.36 → 1642.28] or you watch television,
[1642.28 → 1642.60] as you know,
[1642.66 → 1643.90] that we have not just one or two,
[1644.00 → 1644.68] but multiple,
[1644.82 → 1645.38] this is crazy,
[1645.52 → 1646.62] multiple TV shows
[1646.62 → 1649.06] that are just about houses, right?
[1649.42 → 1650.40] Real estate houses,
[1650.56 → 1651.50] buying and selling homes,
[1651.66 → 1652.34] remodelling,
[1652.78 → 1653.02] you know,
[1653.30 → 1654.82] selling them or keeping them.
[1654.90 → 1656.26] There's just so many stations
[1656.26 → 1658.04] and TV shows about our houses.
[1658.86 → 1659.70] And that's shaped,
[1659.78 → 1660.34] you should know,
[1660.48 → 1662.06] the way we think about our own homes.
[1662.28 → 1663.14] We often think of them
[1663.14 → 1664.18] in terms of square footage,
[1664.80 → 1665.56] layout, decor,
[1665.94 → 1666.76] resale value,
[1666.86 → 1667.56] all of that.
[1667.62 → 1668.12] And none of that
[1668.12 → 1669.12] is inherently bad,
[1669.12 → 1670.46] but I want to suggest
[1670.46 → 1671.92] that we need the biblical story
[1671.92 → 1673.72] to re-narrate the way
[1673.72 → 1675.52] we think about our homes
[1675.52 → 1676.74] because they're not just
[1676.74 → 1678.12] paint colour and real estate.
[1678.98 → 1680.80] They are places of formation.
[1681.68 → 1682.46] And the Christian
[1682.46 → 1684.02] who inhabits any space
[1684.02 → 1685.96] needs to think of that place
[1685.96 → 1687.50] as a deeply formative place,
[1687.58 → 1689.32] a place of discipleship,
[1690.16 → 1691.22] a place of mission,
[1691.22 → 1693.56] a place where you will learn
[1693.56 → 1695.94] to live what you believe
[1695.94 → 1697.58] in the most ordinary,
[1698.40 → 1699.76] boring routines
[1699.76 → 1701.24] with your family.
[1702.94 → 1704.58] Now, I need to make this qualification
[1704.58 → 1705.82] at the beginning of this series
[1705.82 → 1707.92] because when you hear the word home,
[1708.02 → 1708.76] there's a good chance
[1708.76 → 1710.34] you're thinking of something different
[1710.34 → 1711.94] than the biblical story.
[1712.34 → 1713.58] Actually, just back up,
[1713.80 → 1714.98] you should know that in the Scriptures,
[1715.58 → 1716.84] homes matter a lot.
[1716.94 → 1717.98] There is so much teaching
[1717.98 → 1719.28] in the Old and the New Testament
[1719.28 → 1721.48] on how we are to conduct ourselves,
[1721.96 → 1723.38] how we are to love those
[1723.38 → 1724.82] who share a house with us.
[1725.82 → 1726.68] And there are two letters.
[1726.78 → 1727.32] We're going to look at them
[1727.32 → 1728.00] in the next two weeks
[1728.00 → 1729.86] in Colossians as well as Ephesians
[1729.86 → 1731.14] where Paul, writing letters,
[1731.44 → 1733.40] gives a long extended teaching
[1733.40 → 1735.18] on what we call instructions
[1735.18 → 1736.94] for the Christian household.
[1737.86 → 1738.86] It matters to him
[1738.86 → 1740.06] that it's not just how we live
[1740.06 → 1740.70] when we gather.
[1740.86 → 1742.02] It's not just how we live at work.
[1742.10 → 1742.88] It's what we do
[1742.88 → 1746.00] in the very ordinary life at home
[1746.00 → 1747.00] with those people
[1747.00 → 1748.94] who dwell in the same space as us,
[1748.94 → 1751.08] how we live the gospel out there
[1751.08 → 1752.60] matters.
[1753.96 → 1755.18] And here's now the qualification.
[1755.90 → 1756.66] When you hear home,
[1756.76 → 1758.30] you probably think, like I do,
[1758.88 → 1759.96] of a nuclear family.
[1760.34 → 1761.24] Most Western people,
[1761.32 → 1762.06] when you think of a household,
[1762.16 → 1762.94] you think mom, dad,
[1763.08 → 1763.78] maybe two kids,
[1763.96 → 1764.92] or in Canada, what is it,
[1765.08 → 1766.72] 1.7, that's the average household
[1766.72 → 1767.46] size of kids,
[1767.78 → 1768.76] and maybe a dog,
[1769.38 → 1770.88] regrettably, not a dog lover.
[1771.92 → 1773.72] But for Paul and for biblical writers,
[1773.82 → 1774.62] when they say household,
[1774.72 → 1777.00] they have a much wider concept in mind.
[1777.56 → 1778.50] In the biblical story,
[1778.58 → 1779.28] throughout the Bible,
[1779.38 → 1780.06] you would see a household
[1780.06 → 1781.58] including multiple generations.
[1782.16 → 1783.04] It would be mom, dad,
[1783.16 → 1783.90] lots of kids.
[1784.12 → 1784.96] It would be slaves
[1784.96 → 1785.96] and their families.
[1786.52 → 1787.70] It would also be guests,
[1787.98 → 1788.78] unmarried relatives.
[1789.02 → 1790.68] Like, it was more like a clan
[1790.68 → 1792.18] than it was a nuclear family
[1792.18 → 1793.06] that we would imagine.
[1793.62 → 1795.54] It was a very porous space,
[1795.56 → 1797.14] and it's not like they had huge homes
[1797.14 → 1798.78] that we have here in North America.
[1798.88 → 1799.60] They were small homes
[1799.60 → 1800.10] where people lived
[1800.10 → 1800.92] in tight proximity,
[1801.38 → 1802.90] and they had to figure out
[1802.90 → 1803.96] how to be family
[1803.96 → 1805.44] with a lot of different people
[1805.44 → 1806.60] in that space.
[1807.72 → 1808.76] And of the many things
[1808.76 → 1809.56] I could say about that,
[1809.62 → 1810.50] it's worth pointing out
[1810.50 → 1811.28] that if you live
[1811.28 → 1813.32] in an atypical situation,
[1813.32 → 1814.84] that's not the stereotypical
[1814.84 → 1816.52] nuclear family of mom, dad,
[1816.56 → 1816.98] and two kids,
[1817.06 → 1817.68] that's okay.
[1818.48 → 1819.42] You know, I'm quite delighted
[1819.42 → 1820.28] that in our church,
[1820.60 → 1821.54] there are many unique
[1821.54 → 1822.32] housing arrangements,
[1822.46 → 1823.38] whether it's, you know,
[1823.48 → 1824.44] pairing up with a friend
[1824.44 → 1825.66] and buying a house with them,
[1825.98 → 1827.68] or having international students
[1827.68 → 1828.54] staying with you,
[1828.60 → 1829.98] or fostering and adoption,
[1830.40 → 1831.70] multi-generational families.
[1831.70 → 1833.82] These things are all delightful gifts
[1833.82 → 1835.48] where we learn how to be family
[1835.48 → 1836.40] with people who might not
[1836.40 → 1838.10] be biologically related to us.
[1838.26 → 1839.54] We learn how to love people
[1839.54 → 1840.78] and make them feel like
[1840.78 → 1842.30] they belong to a household.
[1843.38 → 1844.06] Carrie Hamlin,
[1844.16 → 1844.86] who was leading worship,
[1844.96 → 1845.74] I remember the first time
[1845.74 → 1846.62] I visited their home,
[1847.02 → 1848.00] we were going downstairs
[1848.00 → 1849.34] and there was a windowsill
[1849.34 → 1850.74] with all these framed photos
[1850.74 → 1851.28] of babies.
[1851.46 → 1851.94] I'm like, man,
[1852.04 → 1853.56] how can you possibly have,
[1853.60 → 1854.74] I think it was nine babies,
[1854.88 → 1855.42] and she was saying,
[1855.50 → 1856.30] oh, well, we foster.
[1856.84 → 1857.70] And these foster children
[1857.70 → 1858.86] are part of our family story.
[1858.94 → 1859.82] They're part of our household.
[1860.34 → 1861.18] And I thought, this is beautiful.
[1861.18 → 1861.94] This is what it means
[1861.94 → 1863.18] to be family.
[1864.88 → 1867.06] When Paul gives specific instruction
[1867.06 → 1867.90] to Christian households,
[1868.00 → 1869.00] and we will see this
[1869.00 → 1869.98] in the next couple of weeks,
[1870.72 → 1872.16] he is aware, I think,
[1872.76 → 1874.02] of how easy it might be
[1874.02 → 1875.46] to present a certain way
[1875.46 → 1876.10] in public
[1876.10 → 1877.50] and how easy it is
[1877.50 → 1878.34] to not think of how
[1878.34 → 1880.10] the gospel and the scripture
[1880.10 → 1881.28] shape how we live,
[1881.46 → 1882.10] what we might say,
[1882.18 → 1882.78] in private.
[1883.30 → 1884.78] And you know this, you know.
[1885.00 → 1886.36] There is a stereotype
[1886.36 → 1887.82] of like how you go to church,
[1887.88 → 1888.72] you get dressed up,
[1888.80 → 1889.92] you do well,
[1889.92 → 1891.04] and you present well,
[1891.10 → 1892.00] and you speak well
[1892.00 → 1893.20] with the people in church.
[1893.46 → 1894.44] And then you go home
[1894.44 → 1896.24] and the true self emerges,
[1896.70 → 1896.94] right?
[1897.54 → 1898.54] And if you're a young parent,
[1898.58 → 1899.72] I'm just going to name our reality,
[1900.14 → 1901.26] you know there's been times
[1901.26 → 1902.38] where you've yelled at your kids
[1902.38 → 1903.28] on the way to church
[1903.28 → 1903.78] in the van,
[1904.60 → 1905.94] maybe even yelled at them
[1905.94 → 1906.84] on the way home
[1906.84 → 1907.46] in the van,
[1907.70 → 1908.26] right?
[1908.26 → 1910.50] The true self seems to emerge
[1910.50 → 1911.18] when you get in that
[1911.18 → 1912.40] comfortable space of home
[1912.40 → 1913.28] and you're still triggered
[1913.28 → 1914.40] by the pile of dishes
[1914.40 → 1916.20] your husband left in the sink.
[1917.66 → 1919.02] Yeah, I heard a collective groan
[1919.02 → 1920.06] in the 9 a.m. too.
[1921.04 → 1922.40] You're still super annoyed
[1922.40 → 1923.32] by the way your roommate
[1923.32 → 1924.22] has these habits
[1924.22 → 1925.08] of loud music
[1925.08 → 1925.94] and untidiness
[1925.94 → 1927.04] that drive you crazy.
[1927.86 → 1929.10] Or your sibling
[1929.10 → 1930.56] that just has a way
[1930.56 → 1931.62] of getting under your skin
[1931.62 → 1932.24] and you're yelling
[1932.24 → 1932.80] at each other
[1932.80 → 1933.88] and you just can't figure out
[1933.88 → 1934.60] how to live well
[1934.60 → 1935.40] in this space.
[1935.40 → 1936.04] And the home,
[1936.18 → 1936.80] hear this well,
[1937.46 → 1938.32] is the place
[1938.32 → 1940.40] where we learn how to love.
[1941.96 → 1943.94] Sometimes love our enemies
[1943.94 → 1945.12] in the same household.
[1945.56 → 1946.14] Where we learn
[1946.14 → 1947.18] how to bear with one another,
[1947.28 → 1947.74] how we learn
[1947.74 → 1949.08] how to practice peacemaking,
[1949.46 → 1949.84] forgiving,
[1950.40 → 1951.22] reconciling,
[1951.40 → 1952.70] and being Christians
[1952.70 → 1954.68] who live at what we believe
[1954.68 → 1955.22] about Jesus
[1955.22 → 1957.46] in that space with family.
[1958.22 → 1959.08] That's what our households are.
[1959.14 → 1960.40] It's a stomping ground
[1960.40 → 1961.20] for our formation.
[1961.36 → 1962.22] It's an incubator
[1962.22 → 1963.26] for discipleship.
[1963.34 → 1964.28] It's loving our enemies
[1964.28 → 1964.94] and our neighbours.
[1965.40 → 1966.90] In that particular space.
[1968.28 → 1970.02] Now, given that we just installed
[1970.02 → 1970.74] or commissioned
[1970.74 → 1971.72] new elders and deacons,
[1971.84 → 1972.66] I want to tie,
[1973.20 → 1974.14] connect some dots here.
[1974.76 → 1975.66] It's worth pointing out
[1975.66 → 1976.48] that in Timothy,
[1977.08 → 1978.54] when Paul is instructing
[1978.54 → 1979.32] young leaders,
[1979.54 → 1980.62] this is what he says.
[1983.22 → 1983.88] He says,
[1984.04 → 1985.44] he must manage
[1985.44 → 1986.78] his own family well
[1986.78 → 1988.12] and see that his children
[1988.12 → 1988.70] obey him.
[1988.76 → 1989.54] I love that part.
[1989.62 → 1990.18] Really love that.
[1990.26 → 1991.10] The obedience of children.
[1991.72 → 1992.84] And then Paul goes on to say,
[1992.92 → 1993.70] and he must do so
[1993.70 → 1994.24] in a manner
[1994.24 → 1994.86] that is worthy
[1994.86 → 1995.56] of full respect.
[1995.68 → 1996.36] So that's the character
[1996.36 → 1996.90] of the leader.
[1997.28 → 1998.66] And then this parenthetical statement.
[1999.08 → 2000.56] If anyone does not know
[2000.56 → 2001.12] how to manage
[2001.12 → 2001.82] his own family,
[2002.06 → 2003.12] how can he take care
[2003.12 → 2003.94] of God's church?
[2004.70 → 2006.24] I feel so challenged
[2006.24 → 2007.04] personally
[2007.04 → 2008.20] by that statement.
[2008.56 → 2008.98] But do you see
[2008.98 → 2009.66] what Paul's doing?
[2010.10 → 2010.48] He's saying,
[2010.58 → 2011.60] the way you live at home,
[2011.82 → 2012.70] the kind of character
[2012.70 → 2013.28] you have in the home
[2013.28 → 2014.36] will shape how you live
[2014.36 → 2014.94] in your church.
[2015.32 → 2015.92] You might be able
[2015.92 → 2016.50] to hide it
[2016.50 → 2017.30] for a little while.
[2017.54 → 2017.96] You might be able
[2017.96 → 2018.82] to put on a good face
[2018.82 → 2019.36] for a little while.
[2019.36 → 2020.66] But the way you serve
[2020.66 → 2021.18] and lead
[2021.18 → 2022.14] and live with your family
[2022.14 → 2023.52] will have a direct impact
[2023.52 → 2024.82] on whether you are capable
[2024.82 → 2026.46] and have the gifting for
[2026.46 → 2027.28] serving and leading
[2027.28 → 2027.86] and serving
[2027.86 → 2028.90] or caring for
[2028.90 → 2029.68] your church.
[2030.34 → 2031.40] How you live at home
[2031.40 → 2032.46] matters so much so
[2032.46 → 2033.72] that if you're not doing well
[2033.72 → 2035.20] and it's not going well,
[2035.28 → 2035.68] Paul says,
[2036.00 → 2036.48] please,
[2036.92 → 2038.22] don't lead the church either.
[2038.84 → 2039.74] Those are strong words.
[2039.82 → 2040.84] And I just want us to hear
[2040.84 → 2042.46] the strength of his conviction
[2042.46 → 2043.04] in that.
[2044.54 → 2045.76] Now in Matthew 22,
[2046.36 → 2047.76] our passage for this morning,
[2047.76 → 2050.14] there's a convicting element to it.
[2050.20 → 2051.26] But Jesus is being grilled
[2051.26 → 2053.76] by Sadducee's and Pharisees.
[2053.84 → 2054.66] They're trying to trap him.
[2054.78 → 2055.62] They're threatened by him.
[2055.90 → 2056.72] They're trying to find
[2056.72 → 2057.38] things he says
[2057.38 → 2058.20] and trip him up
[2058.20 → 2059.06] with what he says.
[2059.10 → 2059.84] And they ask him
[2059.84 → 2061.34] this basic question.
[2062.10 → 2062.92] They say to Jesus,
[2063.54 → 2065.98] what is the greatest commandment?
[2066.76 → 2067.62] And Jesus answers
[2067.62 → 2069.38] by quoting a love passage of theirs,
[2069.52 → 2070.74] Deuteronomy 6 verse 5.
[2070.82 → 2071.30] He says,
[2072.00 → 2073.32] love the Lord your God
[2073.32 → 2074.30] with all your heart
[2074.30 → 2075.58] and all your soul
[2075.58 → 2076.70] and all your mind.
[2076.70 → 2078.24] This is the first
[2078.24 → 2079.70] and greatest commandment.
[2080.32 → 2081.44] And that by itself
[2081.44 → 2082.50] would have been enough.
[2083.08 → 2083.92] They would have been satisfied
[2083.92 → 2084.24] to say,
[2084.32 → 2084.74] correct,
[2085.10 → 2085.86] you understand
[2085.86 → 2086.88] the Old Testament law.
[2087.14 → 2088.80] But then Jesus gives them a bonus.
[2089.28 → 2090.96] Gives them a bonus extra answer.
[2091.04 → 2091.36] He says,
[2091.50 → 2092.24] and the second
[2092.24 → 2094.52] is like it.
[2095.80 → 2096.92] Love your neighbour
[2096.92 → 2098.66] as yourself.
[2099.94 → 2101.00] And he says that
[2101.00 → 2102.32] for a very particular reason.
[2103.22 → 2104.02] And you need to know
[2104.02 → 2106.10] that Jesus is summarizing
[2106.10 → 2106.90] all the law
[2106.90 → 2107.36] and the prophets.
[2107.48 → 2108.52] This is the whole teaching
[2108.52 → 2109.52] of the Old Testament here.
[2109.70 → 2110.34] Loving the Lord
[2110.34 → 2111.26] with all of our hearts,
[2111.32 → 2111.62] our souls,
[2111.72 → 2112.10] our minds,
[2112.20 → 2113.16] and loving our neighbour
[2113.16 → 2113.82] as ourselves.
[2113.88 → 2114.40] And notice,
[2114.86 → 2115.96] it's not first about duty,
[2116.12 → 2117.42] it's not first about moral instruction,
[2117.70 → 2119.22] it is a relationship of love
[2119.22 → 2120.94] with our Father,
[2121.38 → 2121.56] Son,
[2121.62 → 2122.28] and Holy Spirit
[2122.28 → 2123.02] that leads
[2123.02 → 2124.32] to loving our neighbour.
[2124.74 → 2125.42] That is to say,
[2125.50 → 2126.10] if you do not have
[2126.10 → 2126.92] the love of God in you,
[2126.92 → 2127.56] you will not be able
[2127.56 → 2128.68] to love your neighbour well.
[2129.00 → 2130.04] If you hate your neighbour,
[2130.16 → 2131.20] it's because you are not filled
[2131.20 → 2131.86] with the love of God.
[2131.92 → 2133.06] These things go hand in glove,
[2133.14 → 2134.42] they can't be separated
[2134.42 → 2135.12] from one another.
[2135.38 → 2136.20] And you should know
[2136.20 → 2138.34] that we will need
[2138.34 → 2139.56] the love of God
[2139.56 → 2140.46] and to be in relationship
[2140.46 → 2140.82] with Him
[2140.82 → 2142.86] in order to love others.
[2144.40 → 2144.66] You know,
[2144.68 → 2145.20] I've noticed
[2145.20 → 2146.18] over the last number of years
[2146.18 → 2147.22] as I talk to friends,
[2147.36 → 2148.06] talk to young dads
[2148.06 → 2148.64] in our church,
[2149.16 → 2149.84] that usually
[2149.84 → 2151.00] as we lean into
[2151.00 → 2152.20] our relationship with God,
[2152.26 → 2153.64] as we learn to listen to Him,
[2154.02 → 2155.06] receive His love,
[2155.42 → 2156.34] submit to His Word,
[2156.34 → 2158.34] it naturally flows
[2158.34 → 2159.96] into a love of spouse,
[2160.32 → 2161.12] a love of children,
[2161.20 → 2162.06] a love of coworkers.
[2162.24 → 2163.80] It naturally enables us
[2163.80 → 2165.24] by the work of God's Spirit
[2165.24 → 2167.26] to really love others.
[2167.64 → 2168.60] There's a flow here.
[2168.94 → 2169.90] And it shouldn't surprise you
[2169.90 → 2171.06] that as you dedicate yourself
[2171.06 → 2171.92] to time with the Lord,
[2172.02 → 2173.00] it will translate
[2173.00 → 2174.80] into a love of your neighbour.
[2176.16 → 2177.78] And notice just how radical it is.
[2177.92 → 2178.92] Jesus doesn't say,
[2179.58 → 2179.82] if.
[2180.92 → 2181.36] He doesn't say,
[2181.52 → 2182.96] love your neighbour if.
[2183.54 → 2184.14] They're like you.
[2184.22 → 2184.82] They think like you.
[2184.88 → 2185.88] They believe what you believe.
[2186.22 → 2187.02] And He says then,
[2187.14 → 2188.72] love them as you love yourself.
[2189.64 → 2190.90] All the care you show
[2190.90 → 2191.54] for your own life,
[2191.62 → 2192.92] all the way you take care
[2192.92 → 2193.74] of your own needs,
[2193.78 → 2194.92] you make sure life is wonderful,
[2195.04 → 2196.04] you want to enjoy good food
[2196.04 → 2196.70] and relationships
[2196.70 → 2197.58] and safety,
[2197.74 → 2198.90] all those basic things
[2198.90 → 2200.74] you automatically do for yourself,
[2201.34 → 2201.60] He says,
[2201.64 → 2202.36] you do for your neighbour.
[2203.16 → 2203.96] That's what it means
[2203.96 → 2204.80] to love the Lord
[2204.80 → 2206.10] and love your neighbour.
[2207.54 → 2209.04] Now, here's my conviction.
[2209.30 → 2210.52] Here's why we picked this passage
[2210.52 → 2211.78] for the beginning of this series.
[2212.72 → 2213.50] I'm convinced
[2213.50 → 2215.18] that one of the primary places
[2215.18 → 2216.64] you and I will learn
[2216.64 → 2217.52] to love the Lord
[2217.52 → 2218.34] with our whole heart
[2218.34 → 2219.66] and love our neighbour
[2219.66 → 2220.46] as ourselves
[2220.46 → 2221.90] is our homes.
[2223.48 → 2224.70] It's not the only place.
[2225.18 → 2226.48] We grow in many communities.
[2226.66 → 2227.74] We grow in many relationships.
[2228.02 → 2229.38] But one of the primary spaces
[2229.38 → 2230.54] where you are invited
[2230.54 → 2231.68] to grow in the love of God
[2231.68 → 2232.32] and love of neighbour
[2232.32 → 2234.16] is your household.
[2235.20 → 2235.58] In fact,
[2235.64 → 2236.86] I have an additional conviction.
[2237.60 → 2238.42] My conviction is
[2238.42 → 2239.58] you will grow
[2239.58 → 2240.84] and learn how to love
[2240.84 → 2242.46] the neighbours outside the home
[2242.46 → 2244.20] as you are committed to
[2244.20 → 2245.24] learning how to love
[2245.24 → 2246.76] the neighbours inside your home.
[2247.68 → 2248.24] Would you agree?
[2249.26 → 2250.62] Now, when Jesus gives this command,
[2250.68 → 2251.26] just to be clear,
[2251.62 → 2252.36] He's saying this
[2252.36 → 2252.94] because He knows
[2252.94 → 2254.18] the Jews have a deep hatred
[2254.18 → 2254.98] for Gentiles,
[2255.08 → 2255.88] for non-Jewish people.
[2255.96 → 2257.28] There are all sorts of ethnic conflict.
[2257.40 → 2258.92] There are all sorts of religious stuff
[2258.92 → 2259.52] built into that.
[2259.58 → 2260.08] And they're going to need
[2260.08 → 2261.06] to learn how to love
[2261.06 → 2262.10] those Gentiles
[2262.10 → 2263.12] of other ethnicities.
[2263.40 → 2264.36] And I think that's always true
[2264.36 → 2264.94] for the church.
[2265.60 → 2266.68] But I want to suggest
[2266.68 → 2268.08] that for many of us,
[2268.08 → 2268.88] we often think,
[2268.96 → 2269.28] oh yes,
[2269.34 → 2270.96] I need to go love my coworker,
[2271.22 → 2272.46] go love that person down the road.
[2272.58 → 2273.94] And we often forget to say,
[2274.14 → 2275.36] how might this command
[2275.36 → 2276.66] invite me
[2276.66 → 2277.76] to love the people
[2277.76 → 2278.62] who actually are
[2278.62 → 2279.98] in the closest proximity,
[2281.04 → 2282.10] the people in my own home?
[2284.14 → 2285.60] How might it look for me
[2285.60 → 2286.82] to love the neighbour
[2286.82 → 2288.46] within my household?
[2289.46 → 2290.54] And I'll add this.
[2290.68 → 2291.54] I've already mentioned this
[2291.54 → 2292.42] and I'll say it explicitly.
[2292.42 → 2294.54] I think for many of us,
[2294.62 → 2296.18] it's much harder
[2296.18 → 2297.74] to love our family.
[2298.36 → 2299.08] And the reason is
[2299.08 → 2300.36] they know your weaknesses
[2300.36 → 2301.32] and you know theirs.
[2301.84 → 2302.70] They've hurt you
[2302.70 → 2303.70] and you've hurt them.
[2304.04 → 2305.32] They know you at your worst.
[2305.38 → 2306.06] There's no pretense
[2306.06 → 2306.84] and you know them
[2306.84 → 2307.66] at their worst.
[2308.00 → 2309.38] You've seen all the sin.
[2309.48 → 2310.42] You've seen all the mess
[2310.42 → 2311.70] and you live in that together
[2311.70 → 2312.52] and man,
[2313.04 → 2313.84] it is hard
[2313.84 → 2315.42] to love each other
[2315.42 → 2317.06] when there's so much brokenness
[2317.06 → 2317.68] in a household.
[2317.68 → 2320.36] It is hard
[2320.36 → 2321.16] to love each other
[2321.16 → 2322.64] when they've yelled at you.
[2323.22 → 2324.34] It's hard to love someone
[2324.34 → 2325.18] when they've got habits
[2325.18 → 2326.92] that daily grind at you.
[2327.20 → 2328.20] It's hard to love
[2328.20 → 2330.18] those closest to you.
[2331.92 → 2333.30] And so here's the question
[2333.30 → 2334.82] to even point
[2334.82 → 2335.74] this sermon series
[2335.74 → 2336.66] a little more focused.
[2337.24 → 2338.12] Is your home
[2338.12 → 2339.32] a place
[2339.32 → 2341.30] where you are growing together
[2341.30 → 2343.08] in love of God
[2343.08 → 2344.44] and love of neighbour?
[2345.36 → 2346.18] Is it a place
[2346.18 → 2346.60] where you see
[2346.60 → 2348.46] the fostering of growth,
[2348.92 → 2349.80] the developing
[2349.80 → 2350.84] of discipleship
[2350.84 → 2351.68] and the deepening
[2351.68 → 2352.66] of love?
[2354.32 → 2355.14] And for answering
[2355.14 → 2355.68] that question
[2355.68 → 2356.26] you're going to need
[2356.26 → 2357.58] to do some hard thinking
[2357.58 → 2358.38] and reflecting
[2358.38 → 2359.32] and conversation.
[2360.04 → 2361.10] And my hunch is
[2361.10 → 2361.66] our homes
[2361.66 → 2362.76] are a real mix
[2362.76 → 2363.40] of things.
[2364.08 → 2364.26] Right?
[2364.60 → 2365.26] There's probably
[2365.26 → 2366.62] some beautiful habits
[2366.62 → 2367.52] and practices
[2367.52 → 2368.24] in your home
[2368.24 → 2369.16] that are nurturing
[2369.16 → 2369.70] your faith.
[2369.82 → 2370.00] You know,
[2370.36 → 2370.98] I know enough
[2370.98 → 2371.48] of our families
[2371.48 → 2371.90] to know that.
[2371.94 → 2372.46] There's some pretty cool
[2372.46 → 2373.44] stuff that families do.
[2373.92 → 2374.86] Family devotions,
[2375.34 → 2375.94] family worship,
[2375.94 → 2377.32] shared meals,
[2377.62 → 2378.40] inviting neighbours
[2378.40 → 2378.92] and friends,
[2379.06 → 2379.60] small group,
[2379.94 → 2380.30] children,
[2380.48 → 2380.92] grandchildren
[2380.92 → 2382.24] to have wonderful
[2382.24 → 2383.10] time of hospitality
[2383.10 → 2383.70] together.
[2383.80 → 2384.44] There's some beautiful
[2384.44 → 2384.84] stuff.
[2385.60 → 2386.20] And yet,
[2386.62 → 2387.88] I think if we're honest,
[2388.08 → 2389.22] those things coexist
[2389.22 → 2390.14] with some really
[2390.14 → 2391.00] dysfunctional,
[2391.42 → 2391.96] destructive,
[2392.50 → 2393.54] and sinful patterns.
[2393.54 → 2395.16] and I want to just
[2395.16 → 2396.36] name them as explicitly
[2396.36 → 2397.10] as I can.
[2398.60 → 2400.04] Things like constantly
[2400.04 → 2401.54] yelling at one another,
[2402.74 → 2403.74] speaking in a tone
[2403.74 → 2405.02] that actually dehumanizes
[2405.02 → 2406.42] the person that you're
[2406.42 → 2406.92] married to,
[2407.14 → 2407.82] the children that you're
[2407.82 → 2408.58] called to raise.
[2409.32 → 2410.30] Or perhaps you have
[2410.30 → 2411.90] a massive overconsumption
[2411.90 → 2412.88] of screens that leads
[2412.88 → 2413.70] to disconnection
[2413.70 → 2414.40] and deep loneliness
[2414.40 → 2415.56] even though you live
[2415.56 → 2416.48] in proximity.
[2417.66 → 2418.54] Perhaps it's unhealthy
[2419.26 → 2420.54] habits related to
[2420.54 → 2421.36] internet usage,
[2421.36 → 2423.30] alcohol consumption,
[2423.80 → 2425.02] or financial management
[2425.02 → 2426.28] that is leading to ruin
[2426.28 → 2427.18] in your household
[2427.18 → 2428.14] and no one has the guts
[2428.14 → 2428.96] to say it.
[2430.20 → 2432.14] Perhaps it's a frantic pace
[2432.14 → 2434.04] that squeezes out joy,
[2434.28 → 2435.42] that rushes through meals,
[2435.54 → 2436.36] that makes silence,
[2436.54 → 2437.46] prayer, devotions,
[2437.54 → 2438.24] and even intimate
[2438.24 → 2438.96] relationships
[2438.96 → 2441.06] nearly impossible.
[2441.06 → 2443.76] Is any of this
[2443.76 → 2444.72] hitting close to home?
[2446.26 → 2447.46] Perhaps it's the inability
[2447.46 → 2449.00] to forgive your spouse
[2449.00 → 2449.58] for something that
[2449.58 → 2450.46] happened long ago.
[2451.26 → 2452.28] Perhaps it's a broken
[2452.28 → 2453.24] relationship,
[2453.46 → 2454.30] it's a trauma
[2454.30 → 2454.88] that you've experienced
[2454.88 → 2455.52] together you're not even
[2455.52 → 2456.24] willing to talk about
[2456.24 → 2457.42] and there's just stuff there.
[2458.36 → 2459.62] And I want to just say it
[2459.62 → 2460.50] as clearly as I can.
[2460.58 → 2461.48] Have that conversation.
[2462.38 → 2463.16] I want to give everyone
[2463.16 → 2464.02] in this church permission
[2464.02 → 2464.82] in your small groups
[2464.82 → 2465.94] and in your homes today
[2465.94 → 2468.04] to sit down and say,
[2468.46 → 2469.18] here's what I think
[2469.18 → 2469.96] is such a gift
[2469.96 → 2470.56] in this household.
[2470.84 → 2471.52] Here's the stuff
[2471.52 → 2472.46] that's nurturing our life
[2472.46 → 2472.84] in Christ,
[2472.94 → 2473.62] that's growing us
[2473.62 → 2474.36] in the love of neighbour
[2474.36 → 2475.88] and here's the stuff
[2475.88 → 2477.72] that we really need to change.
[2478.68 → 2479.54] Here are the patterns
[2479.54 → 2480.40] that we know,
[2480.48 → 2481.90] we know this is not healthy,
[2482.18 → 2483.50] we know this is not working
[2483.50 → 2485.36] and we need to address it
[2485.36 → 2486.36] and do what needs
[2486.36 → 2487.40] to be done to grow.
[2488.56 → 2490.30] And that might include counselling,
[2490.96 → 2491.64] that might need
[2491.64 → 2492.70] to include mediation.
[2493.16 → 2494.48] And just as a personal story,
[2494.92 → 2495.62] in my own family
[2495.62 → 2497.34] we had a pretty difficult season
[2497.34 → 2498.88] with my one brother
[2498.88 → 2499.44] as bipolar.
[2499.96 → 2501.08] And it got pretty nasty
[2501.08 → 2501.70] in our household
[2501.70 → 2503.12] as brothers and as family
[2503.12 → 2504.28] and we had a counsellor
[2504.28 → 2505.34] come in to lead
[2505.34 → 2506.30] a mediated conversation
[2506.30 → 2507.48] where we could find ways
[2507.48 → 2508.06] to reconcile.
[2508.62 → 2509.82] And I want to commend to you
[2509.82 → 2510.98] that small act
[2510.98 → 2511.64] that our family did.
[2511.72 → 2512.44] It's a gift
[2512.44 → 2513.80] to name what needs
[2513.80 → 2514.36] to be named,
[2514.70 → 2515.98] to face the dysfunction.
[2516.44 → 2517.26] Because if you don't,
[2517.32 → 2519.12] you could go 10, 20, 30 years
[2519.12 → 2520.36] and you limp along
[2520.36 → 2521.54] in the same ruts
[2521.54 → 2522.96] because you never
[2522.96 → 2524.16] had the courage to say,
[2524.36 → 2525.48] why don't we try
[2525.48 → 2526.32] growing together?
[2526.32 → 2529.58] And my pastoral gut says,
[2530.12 → 2531.20] you already have
[2531.20 → 2532.28] percolating in your mind
[2532.28 → 2533.32] what those things are.
[2534.70 → 2535.44] Whatever it is
[2535.44 → 2536.04] in your marriage,
[2536.40 → 2536.88] whatever it is
[2536.88 → 2537.54] with your parents,
[2537.90 → 2538.36] whatever it is
[2538.36 → 2538.90] with your roommate,
[2539.04 → 2539.74] whatever it is
[2539.74 → 2540.62] with your friend,
[2542.06 → 2543.06] have the courage.
[2543.78 → 2544.82] Pray for the courage
[2544.82 → 2545.88] to speak it out
[2545.88 → 2547.08] and talk it through
[2547.08 → 2548.02] in your home.
[2548.80 → 2550.10] Because the question matters,
[2550.44 → 2551.58] is this space,
[2551.72 → 2552.74] is this family
[2552.74 → 2554.54] growing in the love of God?
[2554.54 → 2555.40] Are these practices
[2555.40 → 2556.10] nurturing us
[2556.10 → 2557.50] or are they holding us back
[2557.50 → 2558.52] from the love of Father
[2558.52 → 2559.90] and the love of neighbour?
[2561.96 → 2562.82] Now I want to finish
[2562.82 → 2563.52] with two things
[2563.52 → 2565.42] and I hope they encourage us deeply.
[2566.94 → 2567.58] Martin Luther,
[2567.74 → 2568.38] in his commentary
[2568.38 → 2569.32] on Matthew 22,
[2569.48 → 2570.38] says the whole gospel
[2570.38 → 2571.34] is found in one word.
[2571.70 → 2572.56] You know what that word is?
[2573.48 → 2573.84] Your.
[2575.20 → 2576.24] Love the Lord,
[2577.08 → 2578.70] your God,
[2578.98 → 2579.88] with all your heart,
[2580.12 → 2580.68] your soul,
[2580.78 → 2581.36] and your mind.
[2581.82 → 2582.58] And Martin Luther said,
[2582.64 → 2583.06] you're not called
[2583.06 → 2583.64] to love a God
[2583.64 → 2584.76] so that he'll love you
[2584.76 → 2585.28] in return.
[2585.38 → 2585.78] You're not called
[2585.78 → 2586.34] to love a God
[2586.34 → 2586.84] who's sitting there
[2586.84 → 2587.60] with his arms crossed.
[2588.02 → 2588.74] This is a God
[2588.74 → 2590.66] who's already made you his.
[2591.40 → 2592.02] This is a God
[2592.02 → 2593.50] who already has shown you
[2593.50 → 2594.56] his love.
[2595.06 → 2595.30] And let me,
[2595.34 → 2595.54] I mean,
[2595.62 → 2596.58] even more pointedly,
[2596.86 → 2597.74] this is a God
[2597.74 → 2598.94] who's already grafted you
[2598.94 → 2600.08] into his family.
[2600.98 → 2601.96] He's made us sons
[2601.96 → 2602.84] and daughters
[2602.84 → 2603.38] through the work
[2603.38 → 2604.62] of Jesus on the cross.
[2605.12 → 2605.68] His death
[2605.68 → 2606.48] and his resurrection
[2606.48 → 2607.32] has secured
[2607.32 → 2608.36] your place
[2608.36 → 2609.34] in the family of God.
[2609.56 → 2610.58] He loves you.
[2610.58 → 2612.74] And he's inviting you
[2612.74 → 2613.72] into that relationship
[2613.72 → 2614.12] of love
[2614.12 → 2615.16] that he already has
[2615.16 → 2616.36] for you.
[2616.80 → 2617.58] You don't need to earn it.
[2617.62 → 2618.32] You don't need to buy it.
[2618.36 → 2619.30] It's already there.
[2619.38 → 2620.12] He's yours.
[2621.10 → 2622.28] And I said this last week
[2622.28 → 2623.14] and I'll say it again.
[2623.32 → 2624.32] The God who loves us,
[2624.38 → 2625.62] the God who's present to us
[2625.62 → 2626.02] this morning
[2626.02 → 2626.72] by his spirit,
[2627.72 → 2629.10] he lives in your homes.
[2630.50 → 2631.02] It's not like
[2631.02 → 2631.78] when we worship Jesus,
[2631.88 → 2632.58] he just stays here
[2632.58 → 2632.96] in the building
[2632.96 → 2633.58] while we go home
[2633.58 → 2634.12] to our houses.
[2634.56 → 2635.62] How strange would that be?
[2636.28 → 2637.34] The Jesus we worship
[2637.34 → 2638.80] is going ahead of us
[2638.80 → 2639.58] and his spirit
[2639.58 → 2641.16] is alive and active
[2641.16 → 2642.56] in our homes.
[2643.40 → 2643.92] And the second
[2643.92 → 2644.74] you start to pray,
[2644.86 → 2645.54] the second you start
[2645.54 → 2646.20] to open the word
[2646.20 → 2646.54] in your homes,
[2646.60 → 2647.16] the second you start
[2647.16 → 2648.18] to have honest conversations
[2648.18 → 2649.56] about Jesus in your homes,
[2649.62 → 2650.24] you say, boom,
[2650.62 → 2651.68] there it is.
[2651.78 → 2653.06] Now I see it.
[2654.38 → 2654.68] You know,
[2654.70 → 2655.56] there are a number of times
[2655.56 → 2656.26] where when people
[2656.26 → 2657.12] move to a new home,
[2657.94 → 2659.02] they invite Brittany and I
[2659.02 → 2659.84] or I've done it
[2659.84 → 2660.70] with other people as well
[2660.70 → 2662.08] to pray through the home.
[2662.48 → 2663.60] And we'll go room by room
[2663.60 → 2664.32] praying through that home
[2664.32 → 2666.14] and that is such a powerful
[2666.14 → 2668.02] and spiritual experience
[2668.02 → 2669.32] where we cannot leave that home
[2669.32 → 2669.90] without realizing
[2669.90 → 2671.60] God lives here.
[2671.86 → 2672.90] Like you feel it
[2672.90 → 2673.88] as you pray through a home
[2673.88 → 2674.64] and you see the kids,
[2674.70 → 2675.20] you see the marriage,
[2675.28 → 2675.82] you see the friends,
[2675.90 → 2676.08] you're like,
[2676.26 → 2676.98] this is a place
[2676.98 → 2677.98] where God dwells.
[2678.20 → 2679.36] And by praying in this space,
[2679.42 → 2680.46] we have now become aware
[2680.46 → 2681.62] of his presence
[2681.62 → 2683.10] and may his will be done.
[2683.16 → 2683.68] And guess what?
[2684.22 → 2685.68] If God lives in your home,
[2686.04 → 2687.44] imagine what could be possible.
[2688.30 → 2689.52] If the same spirit
[2689.52 → 2691.00] that rose Jesus from the dead
[2691.00 → 2692.28] lives in your home,
[2692.46 → 2693.16] imagine what kind of
[2693.16 → 2693.96] resurrection life
[2693.96 → 2694.74] could take place
[2694.74 → 2695.50] in your relationships,
[2696.32 → 2697.02] in your marriage,
[2697.34 → 2698.12] with your kids,
[2698.42 → 2699.14] with the roommates,
[2699.50 → 2700.52] with the international students
[2700.52 → 2701.22] who dwell with you.
[2701.46 → 2703.82] Imagine what he might want to do
[2703.82 → 2705.10] in your home.
[2706.40 → 2707.40] I hope that fills you
[2707.40 → 2707.98] with encouragement
[2707.98 → 2709.88] because the God who changes us
[2709.88 → 2710.80] when we gather for worship
[2710.80 → 2711.88] is a God who will continue
[2711.88 → 2712.64] to change us
[2712.64 → 2714.38] when we go to the most ordinary,
[2714.74 → 2715.80] mundane routines
[2715.80 → 2716.86] of Monday morning.
[2717.76 → 2719.76] That's the kind of God he is.
[2719.76 → 2723.94] But here's my concluding conviction.
[2725.22 → 2726.20] I'm convinced
[2726.20 → 2728.20] that the place
[2728.20 → 2729.86] where people discover
[2729.86 → 2730.62] the grace of God
[2730.62 → 2731.94] who don't yet follow Jesus
[2731.94 → 2733.98] is most often
[2733.98 → 2735.02] the home.
[2736.18 → 2737.18] A lot of stuff
[2737.18 → 2737.72] that I've read
[2737.72 → 2739.36] on being in a post-Christian context,
[2739.48 → 2740.30] and when I say post-Christian,
[2740.44 → 2741.28] I mean Christianity
[2741.28 → 2742.30] has come to Canada
[2742.30 → 2743.72] and many people have said,
[2743.98 → 2744.92] I think I know what it is,
[2745.14 → 2745.90] no, thank you.
[2746.34 → 2747.64] And there's not very many people
[2747.64 → 2748.92] in our neighbourhoods right now
[2748.92 → 2749.40] who are going to be like,
[2749.46 → 2749.90] you know what,
[2750.02 → 2750.62] I'm going to get up
[2750.62 → 2751.28] on a Sunday morning
[2751.28 → 2751.96] and I'm just going to walk
[2751.96 → 2752.44] to a church
[2752.44 → 2753.46] and I'm going to learn about Jesus.
[2753.64 → 2754.88] That's a small percentage,
[2755.24 → 2756.00] and you know,
[2756.04 → 2756.72] I should just qualify.
[2756.84 → 2757.86] Some of you are those people
[2757.86 → 2758.66] and you've come to Jesus
[2758.66 → 2759.90] and we praise the Lord for that.
[2759.94 → 2760.36] He's gracious.
[2760.96 → 2762.10] But generally speaking,
[2762.28 → 2763.82] as I reflect on our own church,
[2763.92 → 2765.36] the way people come to know Jesus
[2765.36 → 2767.00] is around your table.
[2767.92 → 2768.64] It's eating a meal
[2768.64 → 2769.44] with your family.
[2770.02 → 2771.52] It's learning how you organize
[2771.52 → 2772.04] your life
[2772.04 → 2773.18] as a very broken
[2773.18 → 2775.44] yet sanctified by God family
[2775.44 → 2776.98] in your ordinary lives.
[2778.32 → 2778.96] Do you believe that?
[2779.70 → 2780.48] The way that people
[2780.48 → 2781.10] are first going to know
[2781.10 → 2781.92] Hope Community Church
[2781.92 → 2782.94] is as they walk through
[2782.94 → 2783.70] your front door,
[2784.50 → 2785.22] as they get to know
[2785.22 → 2785.90] what life is like
[2785.90 → 2786.68] in your backyard,
[2786.84 → 2787.60] by your barbecue,
[2787.84 → 2788.64] with your apartment.
[2788.78 → 2789.96] That's how it's going to go.
[2791.56 → 2792.40] And just to tell you
[2792.40 → 2793.80] a story from last week.
[2794.28 → 2795.38] After the ministry fair,
[2795.50 → 2796.04] which by the way
[2796.04 → 2796.66] was such a gift,
[2796.74 → 2797.38] so many people
[2797.38 → 2798.30] were getting involved
[2798.30 → 2799.18] in all sorts of ways,
[2799.30 → 2800.58] launched multiple small groups.
[2801.12 → 2801.90] Someone came up to me
[2801.90 → 2802.88] right after the service.
[2803.02 → 2803.68] Her name is Karen.
[2804.14 → 2804.82] And she said to me,
[2804.88 → 2805.42] I just want you to know
[2805.42 → 2806.40] I signed up for nothing.
[2807.08 → 2807.30] It's like,
[2807.36 → 2808.12] well, thanks Karen.
[2808.36 → 2809.50] Did you hear the sermon?
[2810.48 → 2811.82] And Karen, yeah,
[2811.88 → 2812.60] she heard the sermon
[2812.60 → 2813.82] and she thought,
[2813.90 → 2814.32] no, thanks.
[2814.78 → 2815.78] And then she went on to say,
[2815.86 → 2816.64] my husband and I
[2816.64 → 2817.62] feel very called
[2817.62 → 2819.26] in our home right now.
[2820.14 → 2820.80] We are going to have
[2820.80 → 2821.40] all of our neighbours
[2821.40 → 2822.26] over on Saturday
[2822.26 → 2822.88] and we want you
[2822.88 → 2823.66] to pray for us.
[2824.12 → 2824.70] We want you to pray
[2824.70 → 2825.66] that we'll be salt and light
[2825.66 → 2826.04] with the people
[2826.04 → 2826.74] who live around us
[2826.74 → 2828.08] as they come into our home.
[2828.36 → 2828.96] We want to be
[2828.96 → 2829.66] in ministry there.
[2829.66 → 2832.30] And I was so delighted
[2832.30 → 2833.62] to know that there's
[2833.62 → 2834.30] someone who's saying,
[2834.76 → 2836.56] I believe that the mission
[2836.56 → 2837.62] that God has given me
[2837.62 → 2839.00] is in my living room
[2839.00 → 2840.62] because that's where
[2840.62 → 2841.60] it really happens.
[2842.22 → 2842.98] It's when you build
[2842.98 → 2843.88] real relationships
[2843.88 → 2844.70] in your real home,
[2844.78 → 2845.44] even when your kids
[2845.44 → 2845.92] are screaming
[2845.92 → 2847.28] and things are going sideways,
[2847.50 → 2849.36] even then it's ministry.
[2851.04 → 2852.48] And the same God
[2852.48 → 2854.70] who rose Jesus from the dead
[2854.70 → 2856.20] lives in your home
[2856.20 → 2856.72] in such a way
[2856.72 → 2857.34] that not only
[2857.34 → 2858.28] is His grace sufficient
[2858.28 → 2859.62] to cover over all the sin
[2859.62 → 2860.54] that happens in your home,
[2860.82 → 2862.08] not only is His grace sufficient
[2862.08 → 2862.68] to forgive you
[2862.68 → 2863.38] for all the ways
[2863.38 → 2864.76] you've hurt people
[2864.76 → 2865.32] in your home,
[2865.54 → 2867.10] His grace is so powerful
[2867.10 → 2868.38] it will bring people
[2868.38 → 2868.96] to faith
[2868.96 → 2870.48] through very ordinary
[2870.48 → 2871.28] acts of obedience
[2871.28 → 2872.40] in your home.
[2873.98 → 2874.64] And my prayer
[2874.64 → 2875.36] for our church
[2875.36 → 2876.88] is that our homes
[2876.88 → 2878.02] are hospitable places
[2878.02 → 2878.86] in spite of all
[2878.86 → 2879.60] the brokenness
[2879.60 → 2880.92] where we invite our friends,
[2881.04 → 2881.38] our neighbours,
[2881.52 → 2882.02] our coworkers,
[2882.18 → 2882.68] our classmates
[2882.68 → 2883.66] into those spaces
[2883.66 → 2885.28] and allow them to taste
[2885.28 → 2886.68] in very ordinary ways
[2886.68 → 2888.04] the grace of Jesus
[2888.04 → 2889.12] around the table,
[2890.02 → 2890.96] the grace of Jesus
[2890.96 → 2892.20] in ordinary conversation,
[2892.58 → 2893.44] the love of Jesus
[2893.44 → 2894.30] in our parenting,
[2895.16 → 2896.90] such that they see
[2896.90 → 2898.26] the power
[2898.26 → 2899.46] of His resurrection
[2899.46 → 2900.96] at work in our homes.
[2902.58 → 2903.78] Would you join me in prayer?
[2903.78 → 2916.10] Father, I first want to thank You
[2916.10 → 2917.52] for giving us places to live.
[2918.72 → 2919.88] The gift of a home
[2919.88 → 2922.02] is such a good gift.
[2923.42 → 2924.30] And whatever space
[2924.30 → 2925.02] You've placed us in,
[2925.06 → 2925.94] we praise You for it.
[2927.54 → 2929.12] We recognize that You've placed us
[2929.12 → 2929.88] there for a reason.
[2929.88 → 2932.74] And we now ask, Lord,
[2932.80 → 2933.48] that Your grace
[2933.48 → 2934.16] would be at work
[2934.16 → 2934.78] in our homes,
[2935.52 → 2938.16] bringing us to reconciliation
[2938.16 → 2939.10] where there's division,
[2940.40 → 2941.44] bringing us to healing
[2941.44 → 2942.32] where there's been hurt,
[2943.46 → 2944.62] moving us from places
[2944.62 → 2945.66] that are grudges
[2945.66 → 2947.42] into deep love.
[2948.58 → 2949.76] Lord, we desire
[2949.76 → 2950.60] for our homes
[2950.60 → 2951.22] to be places
[2951.22 → 2952.18] where we grow
[2952.18 → 2953.44] in the love of the Lord
[2953.44 → 2955.08] and we grow
[2955.08 → 2956.14] in love of neighbour.
[2956.14 → 2957.44] and we pray
[2957.44 → 2958.04] that Your Spirit
[2958.04 → 2959.04] would pour out on us
[2959.04 → 2960.12] in our homes.
[2960.64 → 2961.46] That even this week,
[2961.54 → 2962.28] we'd have a sense
[2962.28 → 2964.02] that You are with us.
[2965.44 → 2966.14] And Lord, finally,
[2966.24 → 2967.04] we pray that You would work
[2967.04 → 2967.84] not just in us
[2967.84 → 2968.96] but through us.
[2969.70 → 2970.48] Would our neighbours
[2970.48 → 2971.44] know the gospel
[2971.44 → 2972.54] through our lives?
[2972.62 → 2973.20] Would our neighbours
[2973.20 → 2973.98] hear the gospel
[2973.98 → 2974.86] through our conversations?
[2975.20 → 2976.54] Would they see it lived out
[2976.54 → 2978.40] through our broken bread
[2978.40 → 2979.16] around the table
[2979.16 → 2980.98] and our ordinary lives
[2980.98 → 2981.52] in the yard?
[2982.76 → 2983.70] Use us, Lord,
[2983.86 → 2984.70] in our homes
[2984.70 → 2986.40] to make Jesus known.
[2987.18 → 2988.36] To Him be all the glory
[2988.36 → 2989.42] and the praise.
[2989.94 → 2990.18] Amen.
[2993.86 → 2994.74] We are going to sing
[2994.74 → 2995.90] a song of response,
[2996.00 → 2996.82] a song that gives us
[2996.82 → 2997.48] deep courage.
[2998.06 → 2998.96] Yet not I,
[2999.10 → 3000.32] but Christ in me.
[3000.36 → 3000.94] Would you stand
[3000.94 → 3001.48] and join me
[3001.48 → 3002.02] as we worship?
