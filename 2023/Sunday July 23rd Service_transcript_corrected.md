[0.00 → 5.96] It is my privilege to welcome our last guest preacher for this summer.
[6.42 → 9.62] We have Dr. Mike Going preaching for us.
[9.74 → 12.36] And if you are maybe newer to our church here,
[13.18 → 18.54] Dr. Mike Going is, well, he's part of our church community,
[18.54 → 23.42] but he's usually away teaching in Phoenix and Brazil,
[23.86 → 24.86] and Chile, I should say,
[24.86 → 32.08] where he trains pastors and leaders at the Theological Education Institute, I believe.
[32.24 → 33.46] And he's the director there.
[34.20 → 37.22] And so that's why he's away for most of the year.
[37.32 → 39.88] But during the summer, we have the privilege of him being with us,
[39.96 → 44.00] and he is going to witness to God's Word for us in the way of blessing.
[44.64 → 47.40] And as a short introduction, as many of you know,
[47.78 → 51.12] he is Dave Groen, our lead pastor's father-in-law.
[51.64 → 53.16] Dave Groen's wife, so Brittany,
[53.16 → 55.60] she usually leads one of our worship teams here.
[55.74 → 57.98] And so Mike is Brittany's father.
[58.66 → 61.94] He is a longtime professor of mission theology.
[63.18 → 68.66] Mike has also shaped me and my theological outlook
[68.66 → 70.76] and our church's mission outlook.
[70.92 → 73.86] And so he's been a blessing for us in that way.
[74.36 → 77.34] And so today, directly, we get to hear from him,
[77.36 → 81.48] and we welcome Dr. Mike Going to preach God's Word for us today.
[81.48 → 82.94] So, yes.
[83.16 → 84.16] Thank you.
[84.16 → 85.16] Thank you.
[91.62 → 94.20] Now, you know, Jonathan, I'm not really a guest preacher.
[96.10 → 101.24] My, I am actually, my ordination credentials are held here.
[101.50 → 102.64] I am one of the pastors here.
[102.74 → 103.74] Just want you to know that.
[103.74 → 106.16] Even if I'm not paid.
[107.74 → 110.30] Even if I'm only here four or five months of the year.
[112.20 → 116.04] It's good to be able to bring God's Word to you this morning.
[116.04 → 118.88] Let's pray together as we begin.
[118.88 → 129.28] Father, we want to experience your Word and its power.
[129.28 → 134.14] We do not want to simply learn some new ideas,
[135.06 → 136.94] be shaped by a little new theology,
[137.16 → 138.58] or get some ethical teaching.
[139.58 → 143.40] No, Lord, we want to experience the power of the Gospel to change us.
[143.40 → 148.98] And we plead that the living Christ would come to us,
[149.98 → 152.46] clothed in these words of Scripture,
[153.40 → 157.90] and enable us to experience more and more of his life by the Spirit.
[157.90 → 162.90] Lord, come among us, we pray in Christ's name.
[163.82 → 164.12] Amen.
[168.00 → 170.88] About five or six or seven years ago,
[171.78 → 174.40] we had a day between teaching,
[174.76 → 178.54] and a friend of mine, a theology professor, was visiting.
[178.78 → 180.76] We've been friends for 20, 30 years.
[181.22 → 185.88] So we decided to go for a hike in one of the mountains around Phoenix.
[185.88 → 190.30] And so we started off,
[190.80 → 194.02] and it was supposed to be a nice two-hour jaunt,
[194.84 → 197.32] up around a mountain in the back.
[197.54 → 199.36] About two hours, we thought that would be great.
[199.92 → 202.50] Good time for us to talk,
[202.66 → 204.78] and started walking.
[205.20 → 206.86] We came to a fork in the path.
[207.70 → 210.08] We looked, we just kept talking,
[210.18 → 211.02] and took the left one.
[211.60 → 213.80] And we took off down that left path
[213.80 → 217.68] three, four hours later,
[218.54 → 221.16] my friend Mike says,
[221.66 → 224.70] isn't that our mountain over there,
[224.84 → 226.08] three mountains away?
[227.24 → 230.58] Isn't our car on the other side of that mountain?
[231.18 → 233.52] And I looked, and I was horrified,
[233.52 → 237.38] because we had only had one bottle of water,
[237.50 → 238.22] and we were done.
[238.74 → 240.64] And we knew we were a long way away,
[240.78 → 243.98] and every year, people die hiking those mountains
[243.98 → 245.54] in the Arizona heat.
[246.52 → 247.80] And so we turned around,
[247.88 → 250.24] and we started to hightail it back
[250.24 → 251.94] as fast as we could go,
[252.18 → 253.50] and we were lost.
[254.04 → 255.68] I mean, we were even in a place
[255.68 → 257.14] that had a little sign that said,
[257.42 → 259.42] so many miles to California.
[259.42 → 261.58] I mean, that's how far we had gone
[261.58 → 262.58] along this path.
[263.10 → 265.26] And so we are going back as fast as we can,
[265.38 → 267.28] hoping we can get back before nightfall,
[267.48 → 269.96] and we are moving as quick as we can.
[270.42 → 271.86] Well, the good news is,
[271.96 → 272.80] we made it back.
[273.68 → 274.72] I'm here, right?
[274.92 → 276.00] So we made it back.
[276.86 → 279.22] Both of us were in our early 60s,
[279.26 → 280.28] so we kind of thought,
[280.40 → 281.72] this could be pretty dangerous
[281.72 → 282.74] for people like us.
[283.02 → 284.70] But we did make it back.
[284.70 → 287.20] We had that choice
[287.20 → 288.76] when we came to that path.
[289.14 → 290.16] There were two paths,
[290.28 → 291.76] and we thought this wider path
[291.76 → 293.14] was probably the path to go.
[293.90 → 295.20] Well, we were wrong.
[296.18 → 298.16] You know, that is an image
[298.16 → 301.44] that is used often throughout Scripture.
[302.34 → 304.56] The image of two paths.
[305.46 → 308.14] That is the path of blessing,
[308.98 → 310.10] the path of course,
[310.66 → 312.02] the path of life,
[313.04 → 314.24] the path of death.
[314.70 → 316.52] The path of wisdom,
[317.32 → 319.44] the path of folly and foolishness.
[319.84 → 321.14] The path of obedience,
[321.96 → 323.48] the path of disobedience.
[323.86 → 325.28] The path of conforming
[325.28 → 326.90] to God's creational order,
[327.58 → 330.08] the path of rejecting that way.
[330.08 → 332.78] The path of holding fast to God,
[333.32 → 334.88] the path of turning away.
[335.50 → 337.58] And you hear this throughout the Scripture,
[337.86 → 339.52] and we hear in Psalm 1
[339.52 → 341.06] that introduces the Psalter,
[341.62 → 343.30] blessed is the one
[343.30 → 344.88] who does not walk
[344.88 → 345.96] in the way of the wicked.
[346.82 → 347.90] And then it ends.
[348.34 → 350.68] The Lord watches over the path
[350.68 → 352.64] or the way of the righteous,
[353.02 → 354.50] but the way of the wicked
[354.50 → 356.44] leads to destruction.
[357.00 → 358.46] The whole book of Proverbs
[358.46 → 360.42] is built on the path of folly
[360.42 → 361.82] and the path of wisdom.
[362.34 → 363.54] One leads to life,
[363.54 → 365.74] and one leads to death.
[366.64 → 368.28] And so this is the imagery
[368.28 → 369.92] that has been governing
[369.92 → 371.76] the sermon series for the summer.
[372.86 → 375.66] The way of blessing.
[376.80 → 378.28] The path of blessing.
[378.28 → 381.80] Jesus is speaking to his disciples,
[382.44 → 384.36] and as he speaks to those disciples,
[384.62 → 386.00] nine times he says,
[386.32 → 388.40] blessed are you
[388.40 → 390.26] if you live this way.
[390.98 → 392.92] And he outlines for them
[392.92 → 395.58] the way or the path of blessing.
[397.34 → 399.08] But these words would have been
[399.08 → 400.88] very confusing to the disciples.
[401.42 → 402.98] They would have even been shocking.
[402.98 → 405.96] So what was he talking about?
[406.78 → 410.38] What is this word blessing mean anyway?
[411.12 → 412.18] I don't know about you,
[412.28 → 413.26] but the church tradition
[413.26 → 414.26] I grew up in,
[414.32 → 415.20] the word blessing
[415.20 → 417.36] was really diminished in meaning.
[418.04 → 418.80] It was kind of,
[419.52 → 421.56] if I wanted to pray for somebody,
[421.66 → 421.90] I said,
[422.04 → 423.48] Lord, bless this person.
[423.70 → 424.16] And you said,
[424.22 → 425.24] well, what did you just pray for?
[425.30 → 425.50] I'd say,
[425.62 → 426.20] I don't know,
[426.30 → 427.04] but word blessing
[427.04 → 428.10] sounds warm and fuzzy.
[428.44 → 429.80] It sounds like a good word.
[429.80 → 431.78] It sounds nice and warm,
[432.50 → 433.68] but the reality is
[433.68 → 436.52] that this word is rich,
[436.96 → 438.70] rich in biblical content.
[439.30 → 441.34] I would even say,
[441.68 → 442.86] and I think you might agree with me
[442.86 → 443.82] by the end of this sermon,
[444.20 → 445.36] that the word blessing
[445.36 → 447.56] can actually define
[447.56 → 451.04] the whole Christian faith.
[451.78 → 453.06] It can actually define
[453.06 → 454.90] the whole Christian faith.
[456.16 → 457.58] Now as Jesus spoke
[457.58 → 459.22] to the disciples on the mountain,
[459.80 → 461.34] there are two things
[461.34 → 462.36] that we probably
[462.36 → 463.60] would not have been aware of.
[463.92 → 464.44] Number one,
[465.20 → 466.66] the notion of blessing
[466.66 → 469.56] would have been loaded with meaning.
[469.90 → 472.30] It would have been rich in meaning
[472.30 → 473.72] as they were listening.
[474.26 → 476.10] Because this word blessing
[476.10 → 478.56] was a key word in their story,
[478.96 → 481.44] and that word had been filled
[481.44 → 484.46] with meaning for 2,000 years,
[484.72 → 486.08] and they would have recognized
[486.08 → 487.14] this word quickly,
[487.36 → 488.42] it would have been familiar,
[488.42 → 489.40] would have triggered
[489.40 → 490.98] the entire Old Testament story
[490.98 → 491.56] for them.
[492.62 → 493.72] But the second thing
[493.72 → 495.76] is that what Jesus says
[495.76 → 497.78] about blessing in these words
[497.78 → 502.00] would have been shocking to them.
[502.26 → 503.84] It would have stunned them.
[504.36 → 504.86] Matter of fact,
[505.26 → 506.22] I don't think,
[506.44 → 507.74] and I'm pretty sure I'm right here,
[508.02 → 509.04] they would have understood
[509.04 → 510.70] what he was talking about
[510.70 → 512.20] until much later.
[512.20 → 513.56] because it went against
[513.56 → 515.72] all the prevailing theology
[515.72 → 516.44] of their day,
[516.66 → 517.84] it went against the dominant
[517.84 → 519.76] cultural spirit of the Jews,
[520.22 → 521.98] it went against the conventional
[521.98 → 523.96] wisdom of all of them
[523.96 → 525.20] of what blessing was,
[525.50 → 527.86] and Jesus was asking them
[527.86 → 529.48] to think about blessing
[529.48 → 533.96] in a very, very different way.
[533.96 → 537.44] And over against all the other communities
[537.44 → 538.82] being formed at this time
[538.82 → 539.44] with the Jews,
[539.44 → 541.16] he is forming them
[541.16 → 542.44] to be a very different
[543.08 → 545.22] kind of community.
[545.62 → 547.10] A community that would have
[547.10 → 549.66] walked against the tides,
[549.76 → 551.66] against the powerful stream
[551.66 → 553.60] of the idolatry of his day.
[554.30 → 555.46] And when he is going,
[555.60 → 557.10] this is the path of blessing,
[557.64 → 558.64] path of blessing.
[559.40 → 560.42] This is the way
[560.42 → 561.52] in which you should walk.
[561.52 → 562.50] He is saying,
[563.02 → 563.68] you're going to be going
[563.68 → 564.54] against the way
[564.54 → 565.64] everybody else
[565.64 → 566.96] in the Jewish tradition
[566.96 → 568.06] is walking.
[569.02 → 570.44] I want to try to help you
[570.44 → 571.44] understand that
[571.44 → 573.04] over the next 20,
[573.12 → 574.38] 25 minutes or so.
[575.54 → 577.04] Sid and Jonathan
[577.04 → 577.98] have been taking you
[577.98 → 578.76] through each one
[578.76 → 579.62] of these blessings
[579.62 → 580.54] one by one,
[580.64 → 581.44] unpacking them.
[581.84 → 584.14] But I want to more pull back
[584.14 → 585.48] and help you see
[585.48 → 586.78] how these Jews,
[587.20 → 588.60] how these 12 disciples,
[588.92 → 590.48] as they sat on that mount,
[590.48 → 592.12] listening to Jesus,
[592.58 → 593.80] what they might
[593.80 → 595.00] have been thinking.
[596.54 → 598.08] We need to return,
[598.26 → 599.04] first,
[599.80 → 601.00] to Genesis 12,
[601.28 → 601.92] 2 and 3.
[602.98 → 604.18] Because this is where
[604.18 → 605.84] all Jews
[605.84 → 607.46] turned to in that day.
[607.58 → 608.28] We know because
[608.28 → 609.06] we have their writings.
[610.18 → 611.32] They went back to Abraham
[611.32 → 612.26] as the father
[612.26 → 613.24] of their nation,
[613.72 → 614.62] and they went back
[614.62 → 615.64] to this promise
[615.64 → 616.60] that had been made
[616.60 → 617.20] to Abraham.
[618.08 → 618.96] Let me read it
[618.96 → 619.76] for you.
[620.44 → 621.48] The Lord had said
[621.48 → 622.00] to Abraham,
[622.32 → 623.50] Go from your country
[623.50 → 625.12] and your father's household
[625.12 → 625.82] to the land
[625.82 → 626.72] I will show you.
[627.36 → 628.54] I will make you
[628.54 → 629.68] into a great nation,
[629.68 → 631.02] and I will bless you.
[631.74 → 633.70] I will make your name great,
[633.80 → 635.06] and you will be a blessing.
[635.82 → 637.82] I will bless those
[637.82 → 639.34] who bless you,
[639.60 → 641.06] and whoever curses you
[641.06 → 641.98] I will curse,
[642.40 → 643.84] and all peoples on earth
[643.84 → 645.18] will be blessed
[645.18 → 647.00] through you.
[647.00 → 649.40] This is the promise
[649.40 → 650.70] that is going to shape
[650.70 → 652.46] the entire story
[652.46 → 653.52] of the Bible
[653.52 → 654.68] that follows.
[655.32 → 656.80] God is going to form
[656.80 → 657.96] Israel into a nation,
[658.44 → 660.22] he's going to bless them
[660.22 → 661.22] on the land,
[661.58 → 663.28] and then through them
[663.28 → 664.38] he's going to bring blessing
[664.38 → 665.46] to all the nations.
[665.86 → 667.28] And so Matthew begins
[667.28 → 668.30] his gospel
[668.30 → 670.82] with Abraham.
[670.82 → 673.84] And so blessing
[673.84 → 675.64] was a key word
[675.64 → 676.46] that would define
[676.46 → 677.26] the whole
[677.26 → 678.36] biblical story.
[678.88 → 680.24] So what is it anyway?
[681.32 → 682.68] One of my favourite
[682.68 → 683.78] New Testament authors
[683.78 → 684.92] puts it this way,
[685.72 → 687.02] blessing is in the most
[687.02 → 688.74] comprehensive sense
[688.74 → 691.78] God's purpose
[691.78 → 693.20] for his creation.
[694.28 → 695.74] God wants to bless
[695.74 → 696.52] the creation,
[696.98 → 698.02] he wants to bless
[698.02 → 698.68] humanity,
[699.00 → 700.48] and he is pouring
[700.48 → 701.20] out blessing.
[702.16 → 703.38] So what in the world
[703.38 → 704.24] is it then?
[705.24 → 706.46] It's God's
[706.46 → 707.94] generous gift
[707.94 → 709.08] of all that is
[709.08 → 710.70] good to the world,
[710.98 → 712.12] so that the world
[712.12 → 712.82] and humanity
[712.82 → 713.92] might thrive
[713.92 → 715.42] and flourish
[715.42 → 716.64] and delight
[716.64 → 717.72] in the life
[717.72 → 718.70] that he has given them.
[719.66 → 721.22] God blesses humanity
[721.22 → 722.40] in four relationships
[722.40 → 723.70] to know him,
[724.32 → 725.52] to know and love
[725.52 → 726.08] one another,
[726.68 → 727.82] to be able to care
[727.82 → 728.66] for the creation
[728.66 → 729.88] and then to have
[729.88 → 731.08] harmony in ourselves.
[732.02 → 732.78] And blessing
[732.78 → 734.30] comes as we live
[734.30 → 734.98] in accordance
[734.98 → 736.12] with God's law
[736.12 → 737.10] and word
[737.10 → 739.78] and live wisely.
[740.90 → 742.70] Blessing is synonymous
[742.70 → 743.78] in the Old Testament
[743.78 → 744.82] with life,
[745.20 → 746.42] with the abundance
[746.42 → 747.34] of life
[747.34 → 748.62] and flourishing.
[748.62 → 750.76] And the flourishing
[750.76 → 752.84] that God wants
[752.84 → 753.38] for his people
[753.38 → 754.66] can only be received
[754.66 → 755.70] as we know him
[755.70 → 756.80] and receive it
[756.80 → 757.34] as a gift
[757.34 → 758.24] from his hand.
[759.16 → 759.68] It's known
[759.68 → 760.38] in relationship
[760.38 → 761.08] to God.
[761.88 → 762.78] But it's interesting
[762.78 → 764.42] to see how this word
[764.42 → 765.48] bless
[765.48 → 766.40] develops
[766.40 → 767.66] in later history.
[768.72 → 769.60] Soon this word
[769.60 → 770.22] is being used
[770.22 → 770.86] not just about
[770.86 → 772.48] God blessing us,
[773.00 → 773.98] but us
[773.98 → 775.22] blessing others
[775.22 → 776.16] and blessing
[776.16 → 777.18] God himself.
[777.78 → 778.36] In other words,
[778.36 → 779.48] as we are blessed,
[779.90 → 780.74] we bless God
[780.74 → 781.44] in thanksgiving
[781.44 → 782.06] and praise
[782.06 → 783.88] and we bless others
[783.88 → 785.96] with selfless love.
[787.58 → 788.34] Blessing
[788.34 → 789.76] defines
[789.76 → 791.14] what it means
[791.14 → 792.18] to be human,
[792.98 → 793.68] flourishing,
[794.02 → 794.58] thriving,
[795.24 → 796.02] satisfying,
[796.30 → 796.94] abundant,
[797.52 → 798.44] prospering life.
[798.80 → 800.30] That's what God
[800.30 → 801.48] gave in the garden
[801.48 → 802.94] and what he intends
[802.94 → 803.98] for humanity.
[804.78 → 805.94] That's what was lost
[805.94 → 807.18] in Adam and Eve's sin.
[807.18 → 808.74] And that's
[808.74 → 809.76] what was promised
[809.76 → 810.42] to Abraham
[810.42 → 812.10] that he would
[812.10 → 813.28] restore it.
[814.82 → 815.94] I want to take you
[815.94 → 817.10] through a real quick,
[817.20 → 818.42] maybe 15 minute or so,
[818.64 → 819.14] jaunt
[819.14 → 820.36] through the biblical story
[820.36 → 821.70] so you can know
[821.70 → 822.56] the story
[822.56 → 823.40] that is shaping
[823.40 → 824.30] the disciples.
[826.10 → 827.38] God created
[827.38 → 828.50] humanity
[828.50 → 829.96] for blessing.
[829.96 → 830.02] blessing.
[831.12 → 832.50] This is the way
[832.50 → 833.22] of blessing,
[833.38 → 834.04] God said,
[834.54 → 835.12] twice
[835.12 → 837.24] in Genesis 1.
[837.74 → 838.78] He gave the blessing
[838.78 → 840.32] and he invited them
[840.32 → 841.06] to delight
[841.06 → 842.04] in knowing him,
[842.50 → 843.10] to delight
[843.10 → 844.30] in knowing one another,
[844.66 → 845.24] to delight
[845.24 → 846.12] in the good gifts
[846.12 → 847.28] of God's creation.
[848.08 → 849.10] God blesses.
[849.86 → 850.30] Now,
[850.50 → 851.56] I want to ask you,
[852.56 → 853.42] how have you been
[853.42 → 853.88] blessed
[853.88 → 854.96] this week?
[855.62 → 857.36] Probably in a million ways.
[857.36 → 859.16] But let me just tell you
[859.16 → 859.72] some of the ways
[859.72 → 861.24] I've known God's blessing.
[862.26 → 863.02] Most mornings,
[863.64 → 864.50] I have a walk
[864.50 → 865.22] with Marnie
[865.22 → 865.90] for about an hour,
[866.02 → 866.54] 20 minutes,
[866.60 → 867.42] an hour and a half
[867.42 → 868.86] and then we have coffee.
[869.64 → 870.72] I love that lady.
[872.02 → 873.52] That is a blessing
[873.52 → 874.06] for me
[874.06 → 875.10] every single day.
[875.92 → 876.36] Then often,
[876.48 → 877.50] we'll sing at night.
[877.86 → 878.20] We're singing
[878.20 → 879.16] through the Psalms
[879.16 → 880.36] and as we sing
[880.36 → 881.60] and then we pray together,
[881.92 → 882.68] there's a great deal
[882.68 → 883.22] of joy.
[883.34 → 884.18] It's another blessing.
[885.24 → 886.38] I love spaghetti
[886.38 → 887.90] and Marnie makes
[887.90 → 888.68] the best spaghetti
[888.68 → 889.78] and I won't take
[889.78 → 891.18] any counter comments.
[891.74 → 892.22] Marnie makes
[892.22 → 893.10] the best spaghetti
[893.10 → 894.28] and she made
[894.28 → 895.08] the best spaghetti
[895.08 → 896.18] she's ever made
[896.18 → 897.36] ever this week.
[898.16 → 899.64] I really enjoyed that.
[900.42 → 901.84] I enjoyed discovering
[901.84 → 902.56] some new things
[902.56 → 903.00] from the book
[903.00 → 904.34] of Galatians this week.
[905.12 → 906.56] I enjoyed listening
[906.56 → 907.36] to the oldies.
[907.36 → 909.54] Yeah, I like the 60s
[909.54 → 910.54] and the 70s music
[910.54 → 911.76] and I enjoyed putting
[911.76 → 913.28] a bunch of those songs on.
[913.68 → 914.52] My wife wasn't allowed
[914.52 → 915.36] to listen to those
[915.36 → 916.22] when she was in high school
[916.22 → 917.08] so I was explaining
[917.08 → 918.48] some of these songs to her
[918.48 → 919.90] and we were listening to them.
[920.34 → 921.30] I enjoyed listening
[921.30 → 922.40] to Brown Eyed Girl
[922.40 → 924.02] because that's the song
[924.02 → 925.10] that my daughter Brittany
[925.10 → 926.18] wanted to dance with me
[926.18 → 926.86] at her wedding
[926.86 → 927.92] because she was my
[927.92 → 928.86] brown eyed girl.
[929.72 → 930.82] I enjoyed listening
[930.82 → 931.64] to those songs.
[932.36 → 932.80] You know what I really
[932.80 → 934.00] enjoyed doing this week?
[934.32 → 936.32] I enjoyed watching soccer
[936.32 → 937.94] with Oscar and Roman.
[938.64 → 940.32] I enjoyed watching Canada
[940.32 → 941.70] play Nigeria
[941.70 → 943.16] and for our Nigerian
[943.16 → 943.98] brothers and sisters
[943.98 → 944.34] who are here
[944.34 → 945.12] you held us
[945.12 → 946.20] to zero goals.
[947.00 → 948.62] I enjoyed watching that
[948.62 → 949.46] and I enjoyed going
[949.46 → 950.70] to the Vancouver game
[950.70 → 951.36] last night
[951.36 → 953.38] and I enjoyed playing soccer
[953.38 → 954.50] with them in our backyard.
[955.26 → 956.74] My knee kind of hinders me
[956.74 → 957.92] from kicking the ball right
[957.92 → 959.74] but I enjoyed those.
[960.52 → 962.26] These are the good things
[962.26 → 963.10] of creation.
[963.10 → 965.76] I enjoyed spending time
[965.76 → 966.76] with my son Ben.
[967.24 → 968.10] I haven't been able
[968.10 → 969.32] to do that for so long
[969.32 → 970.22] and have just to have
[970.22 → 971.24] quiet time
[971.24 → 972.24] where we just talked.
[973.56 → 975.60] These are wonderful gifts
[975.60 → 977.58] that God wanted
[977.58 → 978.90] human beings
[978.90 → 979.94] to delight in.
[980.24 → 980.76] I could say
[980.76 → 981.82] I love my wife
[981.82 → 982.76] I love my son
[982.76 → 983.96] I love my grandchildren
[983.96 → 985.78] and isn't the gift of love
[985.78 → 987.64] one of the most wonderful gifts
[987.64 → 988.56] that we have
[988.56 → 989.74] in the creation.
[989.74 → 992.62] God gave those gifts
[992.62 → 993.58] as a father
[993.58 → 995.80] and he blessed humanity
[995.80 → 996.18] he says
[996.18 → 996.68] this
[996.68 → 998.76] discover all these
[998.76 → 999.38] good things
[999.38 → 1000.12] in the creation
[1000.12 → 1001.44] and delight in them
[1001.44 → 1002.44] and don't forget
[1002.44 → 1002.98] to come back
[1002.98 → 1003.74] and thank me
[1003.74 → 1004.90] and praise me for them.
[1005.88 → 1007.02] That's what God intended
[1007.02 → 1008.10] in Genesis 1.
[1009.18 → 1010.66] The problem is
[1010.66 → 1013.76] that humanity
[1013.76 → 1015.22] forfeited that blessing
[1015.22 → 1015.90] for curse.
[1015.90 → 1018.96] blessing was the way
[1018.96 → 1020.36] it was supposed to be
[1020.36 → 1022.28] but with Adam and Eve's
[1022.28 → 1022.86] rebellion
[1022.86 → 1024.40] curse
[1024.40 → 1026.32] replaced blessing.
[1027.20 → 1028.42] And the author of Genesis
[1028.42 → 1029.22] wants to make this
[1029.22 → 1029.92] very clear.
[1030.96 → 1031.56] Blessing
[1031.56 → 1032.48] that's used twice
[1032.48 → 1033.50] in Genesis 1
[1033.50 → 1035.60] now five times
[1035.60 → 1036.60] the word curse
[1036.60 → 1037.20] is used
[1037.20 → 1038.60] in Genesis 3-11
[1038.60 → 1039.62] to show
[1039.62 → 1040.50] what the sin
[1040.50 → 1041.56] of Adam and Eve
[1041.56 → 1042.30] had brought
[1042.30 → 1043.50] into the world.
[1043.50 → 1046.20] At the end
[1046.20 → 1046.84] of this week
[1046.84 → 1048.00] I'll fly to
[1048.00 → 1048.46] Ontario
[1048.46 → 1050.06] and I'll preach
[1050.06 → 1050.96] at my
[1050.96 → 1052.50] little sister's
[1052.50 → 1052.84] wedding
[1052.84 → 1054.48] funeral
[1054.48 → 1056.24] my little sister's
[1056.24 → 1056.58] funeral.
[1057.30 → 1057.88] Little sisters
[1057.88 → 1058.44] are not supposed
[1058.44 → 1059.10] to die before
[1059.10 → 1059.74] big brothers.
[1060.98 → 1061.58] She died.
[1062.46 → 1062.96] Death
[1062.96 → 1064.04] many of you
[1064.04 → 1064.68] have faced it
[1064.68 → 1065.70] that's part of
[1065.70 → 1066.10] the curse
[1066.10 → 1066.88] that was never
[1066.88 → 1068.08] meant to be
[1068.08 → 1069.02] part of God's
[1069.02 → 1070.44] blessed creation.
[1071.58 → 1072.42] I heard this week
[1072.42 → 1073.60] about forced child
[1073.60 → 1074.02] labour
[1074.02 → 1074.96] in oppressive
[1074.96 → 1076.12] cobalt mines
[1076.12 → 1077.18] in the Congo.
[1078.20 → 1079.12] I heard about
[1079.12 → 1079.72] two women
[1079.72 → 1080.58] who were paraded
[1080.58 → 1081.22] naked
[1081.22 → 1082.18] and then
[1082.18 → 1084.08] gang raped
[1084.08 → 1085.22] in Manipur, India.
[1086.26 → 1087.38] I heard about
[1087.38 → 1088.62] police violence
[1088.62 → 1089.66] and the way
[1089.66 → 1091.10] many of the poor
[1091.10 → 1091.88] in the Nairobi
[1091.88 → 1093.18] slums
[1093.18 → 1094.16] have been killed.
[1095.22 → 1096.22] I read about
[1096.22 → 1097.34] how human
[1097.34 → 1100.48] cause climate change
[1100.48 → 1101.20] is producing
[1101.20 → 1102.90] record temperatures
[1102.90 → 1103.74] because of the way
[1103.74 → 1104.16] we're living
[1104.16 → 1104.78] in a consumer
[1104.78 → 1105.32] culture.
[1106.26 → 1106.86] And on a very
[1106.86 → 1107.74] small level
[1107.74 → 1108.60] I have very
[1108.60 → 1109.78] difficult conversations
[1109.78 → 1110.48] with some
[1110.48 → 1112.24] difficult relationships
[1112.24 → 1113.42] that must happen
[1113.42 → 1114.18] this week.
[1114.84 → 1115.68] All of us
[1115.68 → 1116.58] experience
[1116.58 → 1117.94] something
[1117.94 → 1119.08] about the curse.
[1119.76 → 1120.72] The curse
[1120.72 → 1122.42] shows
[1122.42 → 1123.62] is not the way
[1123.62 → 1125.16] it was supposed
[1125.16 → 1125.78] to be.
[1126.30 → 1127.42] It was not the way
[1127.42 → 1128.36] it was supposed
[1128.36 → 1128.80] to be.
[1130.00 → 1131.20] But God promises
[1131.20 → 1132.42] to restore blessing
[1132.42 → 1133.66] to all humanity.
[1134.38 → 1135.52] He promises Abraham
[1135.52 → 1136.28] and that through
[1136.28 → 1137.20] his family
[1137.20 → 1138.50] that blessing
[1138.50 → 1139.52] will be restored
[1139.52 → 1140.34] to creation.
[1141.06 → 1142.52] And when he uses
[1142.52 → 1143.36] the word blessing
[1143.36 → 1144.10] he uses it
[1144.10 → 1145.36] five times
[1145.36 → 1146.04] in these verses
[1146.04 → 1147.22] and he does it
[1147.22 → 1148.06] deliberately
[1148.06 → 1149.66] to show
[1149.66 → 1150.98] that in Abraham
[1150.98 → 1151.86] he is going
[1151.86 → 1152.86] to reverse
[1152.86 → 1153.82] the curse
[1153.82 → 1155.06] that has come
[1155.06 → 1156.26] in Adam's sin.
[1156.54 → 1157.26] He's going to
[1157.26 → 1158.34] make it the way
[1158.34 → 1159.32] it was supposed
[1159.32 → 1159.84] to be.
[1160.48 → 1161.10] And he wants
[1161.10 → 1162.18] what we see
[1162.18 → 1162.64] is God's
[1162.64 → 1163.90] incredible grace
[1163.90 → 1165.08] and love
[1165.08 → 1166.00] poured out
[1166.00 → 1166.88] on a world
[1166.88 → 1168.06] that deserves
[1168.06 → 1169.40] to be smothered
[1169.40 → 1170.14] in its curse.
[1172.42 → 1173.54] That family
[1173.54 → 1174.02] that came
[1174.02 → 1174.66] from Abraham
[1174.66 → 1175.68] Israel
[1175.68 → 1177.38] was then to be
[1177.38 → 1178.28] a people
[1178.28 → 1179.38] of blessing.
[1180.66 → 1181.48] In other words
[1181.48 → 1182.02] they were to be
[1182.02 → 1182.56] a people
[1182.56 → 1183.42] that would live
[1183.42 → 1184.36] before the nations
[1184.36 → 1184.78] and say
[1184.78 → 1185.52] this is what
[1185.52 → 1186.38] it truly
[1186.38 → 1187.46] means
[1187.46 → 1188.62] to be human.
[1189.06 → 1189.62] This is what
[1189.62 → 1190.52] God intends
[1190.52 → 1191.44] for human life
[1191.44 → 1192.04] love
[1192.04 → 1192.94] and compassion
[1192.94 → 1194.14] and joy
[1194.14 → 1195.40] and thanksgiving
[1195.40 → 1196.30] and so on.
[1196.82 → 1197.42] And he's going
[1197.42 → 1198.58] to form that people
[1198.58 → 1199.04] and he's going
[1199.04 → 1199.82] to place them
[1199.82 → 1200.50] on the land.
[1201.50 → 1202.04] But before
[1202.04 → 1202.74] they go on
[1202.74 → 1203.42] to the land
[1203.42 → 1204.16] to live
[1204.16 → 1204.76] as a people
[1204.76 → 1205.38] of blessing
[1205.38 → 1206.44] before the nations
[1206.44 → 1207.88] he sets
[1207.88 → 1208.86] before them
[1208.86 → 1210.16] this choice.
[1211.02 → 1211.82] This is found
[1211.82 → 1213.18] in Deuteronomy 30
[1213.18 → 1213.70] as they are
[1213.70 → 1214.14] a people
[1214.14 → 1214.76] of blessing
[1214.76 → 1216.04] he sets
[1216.04 → 1217.08] this choice
[1217.08 → 1218.16] before them.
[1220.06 → 1220.90] Wait for it
[1220.90 → 1221.12] Derek.
[1222.48 → 1223.36] There we go.
[1224.14 → 1225.44] In Deuteronomy 30
[1225.44 → 1228.28] Moses the grandfather
[1228.28 → 1230.10] comes, and he sees
[1230.10 → 1230.90] his grandchildren
[1230.90 → 1231.74] and those of you
[1231.74 → 1232.56] who are grandparents
[1232.56 → 1233.40] or even parents
[1233.40 → 1234.78] know the longing
[1234.78 → 1235.48] of your heart
[1235.48 → 1236.38] is to see your
[1236.38 → 1237.04] grandchildren
[1237.04 → 1238.60] thrive and flourish.
[1239.56 → 1240.86] Moses the grandfather
[1240.86 → 1242.20] comes, and he says
[1242.20 → 1243.52] you're about to go
[1243.52 → 1244.54] into the land
[1244.54 → 1246.28] and he says
[1246.28 → 1246.80] to them
[1246.80 → 1247.96] I'm giving you
[1247.96 → 1248.66] my law.
[1249.58 → 1250.86] My law will direct
[1250.86 → 1251.66] and guide
[1251.66 → 1252.54] and show you
[1252.54 → 1253.84] how to live
[1253.84 → 1255.38] lives of love
[1255.38 → 1256.38] and generosity
[1256.38 → 1257.32] and kindness
[1257.32 → 1258.52] and Thanksgiving.
[1259.44 → 1260.68] My law will show you
[1260.68 → 1261.74] how to live a life
[1261.74 → 1262.56] that is blessed
[1262.56 → 1264.32] and if you respond
[1264.32 → 1265.50] and believe me
[1265.50 → 1266.72] I promise
[1266.72 → 1267.66] and obey me
[1267.66 → 1268.78] I promise you
[1268.78 → 1269.42] life
[1269.42 → 1270.48] prosperity
[1270.48 → 1271.18] and blessing.
[1271.18 → 1273.24] On the other hand
[1273.24 → 1275.32] if you do not
[1275.32 → 1276.68] if you respond
[1276.68 → 1277.58] in unbelief
[1277.58 → 1278.74] and disobedience
[1278.74 → 1280.12] what will happen
[1280.12 → 1281.42] is you will experience
[1281.42 → 1282.06] death
[1282.06 → 1283.44] destruction
[1283.44 → 1284.82] and the curse.
[1285.38 → 1286.66] This is exactly
[1286.66 → 1288.52] Moses' language
[1288.52 → 1290.20] in Deuteronomy 30
[1290.20 → 1291.72] and he says
[1291.72 → 1292.56] now at the end
[1292.56 → 1293.24] of this sermon
[1293.24 → 1293.56] he says
[1293.56 → 1294.90] now choose life
[1294.90 → 1296.68] go on to the land
[1296.68 → 1298.12] choose blessing
[1298.12 → 1298.90] and life
[1298.90 → 1300.18] and live that
[1300.18 → 1302.24] before the nations.
[1303.98 → 1305.14] In Deuteronomy
[1305.14 → 1306.98] 27 through 29
[1306.98 → 1308.36] he then says
[1308.36 → 1308.82] to them
[1308.82 → 1310.30] that what's going
[1310.30 → 1310.74] to happen
[1310.74 → 1311.34] on the land
[1311.34 → 1312.06] if you don't live
[1312.06 → 1312.50] this way
[1312.50 → 1313.26] is the curses
[1313.26 → 1314.26] will fall on you
[1314.26 → 1315.70] until finally
[1315.70 → 1316.84] you are exiled
[1316.84 → 1317.88] from the land.
[1318.96 → 1320.08] And in Deuteronomy
[1320.08 → 1321.44] 27 to 29
[1321.44 → 1322.82] took place
[1322.82 → 1323.96] exactly
[1323.96 → 1325.66] and what we see
[1325.66 → 1326.48] by the end
[1326.48 → 1327.46] of the Old Testament
[1327.46 → 1328.14] story
[1328.14 → 1329.86] is that Israel
[1329.86 → 1330.90] is living
[1330.90 → 1332.42] under a curse.
[1333.20 → 1333.80] She is living
[1333.80 → 1334.54] under a curse
[1334.54 → 1335.38] because instead
[1335.38 → 1336.34] of taking the way
[1336.34 → 1336.98] of blessing
[1336.98 → 1337.80] and life
[1337.80 → 1338.60] she has walked
[1338.60 → 1338.98] the way of
[1338.98 → 1339.70] disobedience
[1339.70 → 1340.42] and unbelief
[1340.42 → 1341.24] and she has walked
[1341.24 → 1342.18] the way of the curse
[1342.18 → 1343.28] and she is living
[1343.28 → 1344.10] under the curse.
[1345.10 → 1346.22] So what happens
[1346.22 → 1346.94] and what we see
[1346.94 → 1347.52] by the end
[1347.52 → 1348.32] of the Old Testament
[1348.32 → 1348.92] story
[1348.92 → 1349.86] is this
[1349.86 → 1350.58] the circle
[1350.58 → 1351.70] this is where
[1351.70 → 1352.86] Israel is at.
[1353.30 → 1354.34] They know
[1354.34 → 1355.18] as they live
[1355.18 → 1356.80] under the Roman Empire
[1356.80 → 1358.80] this cruel Roman Empire
[1358.80 → 1359.70] that they are living
[1359.70 → 1360.94] under the curse
[1360.94 → 1362.68] because they have
[1362.68 → 1363.50] not lived
[1363.50 → 1364.34] in faithfulness
[1364.34 → 1364.90] to God
[1364.90 → 1365.66] that they have
[1365.66 → 1367.04] joined the rest
[1367.04 → 1367.72] of humanity
[1367.72 → 1368.46] in death
[1368.46 → 1369.24] and destruction
[1369.24 → 1370.34] and the curse
[1370.34 → 1371.52] and they sit
[1371.52 → 1372.78] under that curse
[1372.78 → 1375.02] and as they
[1375.02 → 1376.44] sit under that curse
[1376.44 → 1377.22] under the cruel
[1377.22 → 1378.20] fist of Rome
[1378.20 → 1379.76] they begin
[1379.76 → 1381.18] to long
[1381.18 → 1382.66] for restored
[1382.66 → 1383.22] blessing
[1383.22 → 1385.08] because in Deuteronomy
[1385.08 → 1386.44] 30 God had promised
[1386.44 → 1387.40] after I exile
[1387.40 → 1388.50] from you the land
[1388.50 → 1389.60] I'm going to gather
[1389.60 → 1390.30] you back
[1390.30 → 1391.38] and I'm going to
[1391.38 → 1392.64] restore to you
[1392.64 → 1393.64] blessing
[1393.64 → 1395.10] and life
[1395.10 → 1396.98] and then the nations
[1396.98 → 1397.78] are going to know
[1397.78 → 1398.54] that blessing
[1398.54 → 1399.52] and that life
[1399.52 → 1400.72] and so there is
[1400.72 → 1402.34] a feverish hope
[1402.34 → 1403.08] that begins
[1403.08 → 1404.02] to grow
[1404.02 → 1405.54] among the Jews
[1405.54 → 1407.44] these Jews
[1407.44 → 1408.96] they begin to long
[1408.96 → 1409.66] for the coming
[1409.66 → 1411.00] kingdom of God
[1411.00 → 1412.38] they want
[1412.38 → 1413.44] the comfort
[1413.44 → 1415.20] of Isaiah 40
[1415.20 → 1416.68] they want
[1416.68 → 1417.44] to inherit
[1417.44 → 1418.08] the earth
[1418.08 → 1419.30] like God promised
[1419.30 → 1420.38] they want to see
[1420.38 → 1421.42] God's justice
[1421.42 → 1422.14] on Rome
[1422.14 → 1423.16] like he promised
[1423.16 → 1424.18] they wanted to
[1424.18 → 1424.88] experience
[1424.88 → 1426.00] God's mercy
[1426.00 → 1427.38] they wanted to see
[1427.38 → 1428.66] God come back
[1428.66 → 1429.68] and they wanted
[1429.68 → 1430.38] to again be
[1430.38 → 1431.54] the children of God
[1431.54 → 1432.62] obedient children
[1432.62 → 1433.22] of God
[1433.22 → 1435.10] that's what they
[1435.10 → 1435.98] were longing for
[1435.98 → 1437.66] but here's the
[1437.66 → 1438.12] problem
[1438.12 → 1439.62] if we were to
[1439.62 → 1441.02] understand Matthew 5
[1441.02 → 1443.60] under the powerful
[1443.60 → 1445.20] cruel fist
[1445.20 → 1445.84] of Rome
[1445.84 → 1447.66] Israel had become
[1447.66 → 1450.00] highly nationalistic
[1450.00 → 1451.60] they had
[1451.60 → 1452.48] were starting to
[1452.48 → 1454.26] hate the Gentiles
[1454.26 → 1456.62] they were longing
[1456.62 → 1457.46] and sing
[1457.46 → 1458.40] literally singing
[1458.40 → 1459.98] hymns of vengeance
[1459.98 → 1461.78] on the Roman
[1461.78 → 1464.32] they were carrying
[1464.32 → 1465.10] swords
[1465.10 → 1466.66] waiting for a
[1466.66 → 1468.22] violent overthrow
[1468.22 → 1469.18] of Rome
[1469.18 → 1470.86] in other words
[1470.86 → 1471.78] when the kingdom
[1471.78 → 1472.26] of God
[1472.26 → 1473.00] when God would
[1473.00 → 1473.46] return
[1473.46 → 1474.30] and he would
[1474.30 → 1475.08] bring his kingdom
[1475.08 → 1475.52] and they would
[1475.52 → 1476.28] be comforted
[1476.28 → 1477.10] they would inherit
[1477.10 → 1477.74] the earth
[1477.74 → 1479.78] as God destroyed
[1479.78 → 1481.32] all the Gentiles
[1481.32 → 1482.76] all the Romans
[1482.76 → 1484.32] they had utterly
[1484.32 → 1485.28] forgot their
[1485.28 → 1486.10] responsibility
[1486.10 → 1488.78] toward the Gentiles
[1488.78 → 1489.90] utterly forgot
[1489.90 → 1490.26] that they were
[1490.26 → 1491.12] to live blessing
[1491.12 → 1492.04] for the sake
[1492.04 → 1493.18] of the nations
[1493.18 → 1494.38] and they were
[1494.38 → 1495.14] singing
[1495.14 → 1497.48] hymns of hate
[1497.48 → 1499.74] what about the
[1499.74 → 1500.20] disciples
[1500.20 → 1501.74] did they join
[1501.74 → 1502.18] in that
[1502.18 → 1504.36] you bet they did
[1504.36 → 1506.20] go back and read
[1506.20 → 1507.88] Luke 22
[1507.88 → 1508.50] 38
[1508.50 → 1510.12] you know what
[1510.12 → 1510.66] that says
[1510.66 → 1512.26] Jesus says
[1512.26 → 1513.64] okay
[1513.64 → 1514.84] we're going
[1514.84 → 1516.08] to Jerusalem
[1516.08 → 1517.98] what's the first
[1517.98 → 1518.88] thing the disciples
[1518.88 → 1519.46] say
[1519.46 → 1520.60] when he says
[1520.60 → 1520.92] we're going
[1520.92 → 1521.48] to Jerusalem
[1521.48 → 1524.56] you know what
[1524.56 → 1524.94] they say
[1524.94 → 1527.38] we've got
[1527.38 → 1528.22] two swords
[1528.22 → 1529.34] is that enough
[1529.34 → 1531.38] can you believe
[1531.38 → 1531.64] it
[1531.64 → 1533.24] Jesus has been
[1533.24 → 1533.92] talking to them
[1533.92 → 1534.54] for two and a
[1534.54 → 1535.10] half years
[1535.10 → 1535.72] and the first
[1535.72 → 1536.44] thing they say
[1536.44 → 1537.66] is oh boy
[1537.66 → 1538.88] the war is
[1538.88 → 1539.50] about to come
[1539.50 → 1540.04] we're about to
[1540.04 → 1540.98] overthrow Rome
[1540.98 → 1541.60] because he's the
[1541.60 → 1542.06] Messiah
[1542.06 → 1543.60] we only have
[1543.60 → 1544.80] two swords
[1544.80 → 1545.84] is that going to
[1545.84 → 1546.42] be enough
[1546.42 → 1547.44] to win the battle
[1547.44 → 1549.46] what was Peter
[1549.46 → 1550.28] doing in the
[1550.28 → 1550.74] garden of
[1550.74 → 1551.26] Gethsemane
[1551.26 → 1551.96] swinging a
[1551.96 → 1552.20] sword
[1552.20 → 1552.62] he's a
[1552.62 → 1553.00] fisherman
[1553.00 → 1554.04] what's he
[1554.04 → 1554.28] doing
[1554.28 → 1555.02] swinging a
[1555.02 → 1555.36] sword
[1555.36 → 1557.64] Israel was
[1557.64 → 1558.40] looking for a
[1558.40 → 1559.44] violent coming
[1559.44 → 1560.04] of the kingdom
[1560.04 → 1560.68] of God
[1560.68 → 1561.56] and the
[1561.56 → 1562.56] disciples who
[1562.56 → 1563.00] had heard
[1563.00 → 1563.68] these words
[1563.68 → 1564.26] and didn't
[1564.26 → 1565.22] understand them
[1565.22 → 1566.04] they too
[1566.04 → 1566.68] were looking
[1566.68 → 1567.32] for that
[1567.32 → 1568.06] as well
[1568.06 → 1568.80] and it would
[1568.80 → 1569.64] not be
[1569.64 → 1570.62] until after
[1570.62 → 1571.40] the resurrection
[1571.40 → 1572.26] and the coming
[1572.26 → 1572.86] of the spirit
[1572.86 → 1573.86] the gospel
[1573.86 → 1574.36] of John
[1574.36 → 1574.84] says
[1574.84 → 1575.66] that they
[1575.66 → 1576.24] would come
[1576.24 → 1577.16] to understand
[1577.16 → 1578.00] a lot
[1578.00 → 1578.40] of what they
[1578.40 → 1579.32] totally missed
[1579.32 → 1579.90] in these
[1579.90 → 1580.54] three years
[1580.54 → 1582.18] they missed
[1582.18 → 1583.16] Matthew 5
[1583.16 → 1583.64] to 7
[1583.64 → 1584.52] because here's
[1584.52 → 1585.00] what Matthew
[1585.00 → 1585.98] 5 to 7
[1585.98 → 1586.94] was saying
[1586.94 → 1587.66] to them
[1587.66 → 1590.06] this is from
[1590.06 → 1590.54] a German
[1590.54 → 1591.22] theologian
[1591.22 → 1591.74] who puts it
[1591.74 → 1592.22] this way
[1592.22 → 1593.26] is that when
[1593.26 → 1594.16] Jesus speaks
[1594.16 → 1594.50] to them
[1594.50 → 1595.18] beatitudes
[1595.18 → 1595.90] he's saying
[1595.90 → 1597.28] love your
[1597.28 → 1597.78] enemies
[1597.78 → 1599.28] instead of
[1599.28 → 1599.80] longing for
[1599.80 → 1600.56] their destruction
[1600.56 → 1602.50] unconditionally
[1602.50 → 1603.48] forgive them
[1603.48 → 1604.92] instead of
[1604.92 → 1605.84] retaliating
[1605.84 → 1607.12] be ready
[1607.12 → 1607.88] to suffer
[1607.88 → 1609.34] instead of
[1609.34 → 1610.02] using power
[1610.02 → 1610.64] and force
[1610.64 → 1611.78] be ready
[1611.78 → 1612.16] to be
[1612.16 → 1613.04] blessing
[1613.04 → 1614.16] on peacemakers
[1614.16 → 1615.46] instead of
[1615.46 → 1616.02] singing your
[1616.02 → 1616.72] hymns
[1616.72 → 1617.76] of hate
[1617.76 → 1619.00] and revenge
[1619.00 → 1620.62] what Jesus
[1620.62 → 1621.34] is doing
[1621.34 → 1622.62] is taking
[1622.62 → 1623.96] their expectation
[1623.96 → 1625.44] and totally
[1625.44 → 1626.30] turning it
[1626.30 → 1627.14] on its head
[1627.14 → 1628.22] and calling
[1628.22 → 1629.18] them to live
[1629.18 → 1629.76] in ways
[1629.76 → 1631.02] utterly different
[1631.02 → 1631.84] than all of
[1631.84 → 1632.54] the Jews
[1632.54 → 1633.06] of their
[1633.06 → 1633.62] time
[1633.62 → 1634.42] were living
[1634.42 → 1635.86] what he is
[1635.86 → 1636.32] saying to
[1636.32 → 1636.66] them
[1636.66 → 1638.02] is this
[1638.02 → 1638.60] is the kind
[1638.60 → 1639.16] of person
[1639.16 → 1639.46] that will
[1639.46 → 1639.90] inherit the
[1639.90 → 1640.38] kingdom of
[1640.38 → 1640.60] God
[1640.60 → 1640.88] the one
[1640.88 → 1641.14] that is
[1641.14 → 1641.70] poor in
[1641.70 → 1642.16] spirit
[1642.16 → 1642.98] the one
[1642.98 → 1643.84] that mourns
[1643.84 → 1644.72] the one
[1644.72 → 1645.00] that is
[1645.00 → 1645.56] meek
[1645.56 → 1645.98] and doesn't
[1645.98 → 1646.84] take power
[1646.84 → 1647.58] and control
[1647.58 → 1648.50] the one
[1648.50 → 1648.72] who's
[1648.72 → 1649.14] righteous
[1649.14 → 1650.04] the one
[1650.04 → 1650.48] who shows
[1650.48 → 1650.96] mercy
[1650.96 → 1651.72] to others
[1651.72 → 1652.68] the one
[1652.68 → 1652.92] who's
[1652.92 → 1653.54] pure in
[1653.54 → 1653.92] heart
[1653.92 → 1654.86] the one
[1654.86 → 1655.12] who is
[1655.12 → 1655.92] a peacemaker
[1655.92 → 1658.18] this
[1658.18 → 1659.84] brothers and
[1659.84 → 1660.18] sisters
[1660.18 → 1660.94] goes against
[1660.94 → 1661.74] everything
[1661.74 → 1662.64] that the
[1662.64 → 1663.26] Jews
[1663.26 → 1664.08] believed
[1664.08 → 1665.24] about the
[1665.24 → 1665.64] coming of
[1665.64 → 1666.06] the kingdom
[1666.06 → 1666.68] of God
[1666.68 → 1668.20] Jesus is
[1668.20 → 1669.08] turning their
[1669.08 → 1669.74] world
[1669.74 → 1671.08] upside down
[1671.08 → 1672.36] and he is
[1672.36 → 1672.88] saying the
[1672.88 → 1673.72] Abrahamic
[1673.72 → 1674.18] blessing
[1674.18 → 1675.10] comes
[1675.10 → 1676.60] to these
[1676.60 → 1677.22] kind of
[1677.22 → 1677.62] people
[1677.62 → 1679.24] the Abrahamic
[1679.24 → 1680.48] does not
[1680.48 → 1681.08] come to
[1681.08 → 1681.60] those looking
[1681.60 → 1682.24] for vengeance
[1682.24 → 1683.38] and retaliation
[1683.38 → 1684.88] and violence
[1684.88 → 1686.12] the way
[1686.12 → 1686.80] of blessing
[1686.80 → 1688.46] is meekness
[1688.46 → 1689.40] mercy
[1689.40 → 1690.50] mourning
[1690.50 → 1691.56] poor
[1691.56 → 1692.96] suffering
[1692.96 → 1694.00] love
[1694.00 → 1695.30] and perhaps
[1695.30 → 1696.42] suffering love
[1696.42 → 1697.18] can summarize
[1697.18 → 1697.80] this
[1697.80 → 1699.04] this was the
[1699.04 → 1699.44] way of
[1699.44 → 1699.80] Jesus
[1699.80 → 1700.86] this was the
[1700.86 → 1701.24] way of
[1701.24 → 1701.72] blessing
[1701.72 → 1702.66] this was the
[1702.66 → 1703.14] way of being
[1703.14 → 1704.24] truly human
[1704.24 → 1705.54] and Jesus
[1705.54 → 1706.32] is saying
[1706.32 → 1708.22] this is
[1708.22 → 1708.70] what you are
[1708.70 → 1709.52] called to
[1709.52 → 1710.66] to live
[1710.66 → 1711.30] this way
[1711.30 → 1711.94] of blessing
[1711.94 → 1712.48] before
[1712.48 → 1713.72] the nations
[1713.72 → 1715.94] this is what
[1715.94 → 1716.56] Tom Wright
[1716.56 → 1717.62] says about
[1717.62 → 1718.64] Matthew 5
[1718.64 → 1719.92] he says
[1719.92 → 1721.28] Matthew 5
[1721.28 → 1722.18] in the Beatitudes
[1722.18 → 1723.48] is a challenge
[1723.48 → 1724.76] to Israel
[1724.76 → 1726.62] to be
[1726.62 → 1727.66] Israel
[1727.66 → 1729.06] an appeal
[1729.06 → 1729.46] for them
[1729.46 → 1730.12] to take up
[1730.12 → 1730.96] their vocation
[1730.96 → 1731.30] again
[1731.30 → 1732.72] their vocation
[1732.72 → 1733.20] of being
[1733.20 → 1733.92] blessed
[1733.92 → 1734.94] to bless
[1734.94 → 1735.62] the nations
[1735.62 → 1736.66] something
[1736.66 → 1737.14] they had
[1737.14 → 1738.16] totally forgot
[1738.16 → 1739.16] to live
[1739.16 → 1739.70] before the
[1739.70 → 1740.06] nations
[1740.06 → 1740.64] in blessing
[1740.64 → 1741.54] now they
[1741.54 → 1741.94] wanted to
[1741.94 → 1742.32] destroy
[1742.32 → 1742.48] them
[1742.48 → 1742.76] he says
[1742.76 → 1743.40] Jesus
[1743.40 → 1743.86] is saying
[1743.86 → 1744.42] take up
[1744.42 → 1745.14] your vocation
[1745.14 → 1745.52] again
[1745.52 → 1746.90] God had
[1746.90 → 1747.28] said
[1747.28 → 1747.58] I'm going
[1747.58 → 1748.00] to bless
[1748.00 → 1748.24] you
[1748.24 → 1748.98] so that
[1748.98 → 1749.26] you'll be
[1749.26 → 1749.68] a blessing
[1749.68 → 1750.04] to the
[1750.04 → 1750.44] nations
[1750.44 → 1751.84] but they
[1751.84 → 1752.42] had forgotten
[1752.42 → 1753.76] and now
[1753.76 → 1754.16] Jesus
[1754.16 → 1754.86] says this
[1754.86 → 1755.18] is how
[1755.18 → 1755.48] you are
[1755.48 → 1756.02] to live
[1756.02 → 1757.34] you should
[1757.34 → 1758.10] not desire
[1758.10 → 1758.94] the demise
[1758.94 → 1759.32] of the
[1759.32 → 1759.68] Romans
[1759.68 → 1760.70] you're called
[1760.70 → 1761.18] to bless
[1761.18 → 1761.46] them
[1761.46 → 1762.48] you're not
[1762.48 → 1763.06] to live
[1763.06 → 1763.46] like the
[1763.46 → 1764.12] other Jews
[1764.12 → 1765.20] that alienate
[1765.20 → 1766.06] and hate
[1766.06 → 1766.56] and want
[1766.56 → 1767.18] revenge on
[1767.18 → 1767.86] the Gentiles
[1767.86 → 1768.38] you're to
[1768.38 → 1768.78] live to
[1768.78 → 1769.56] selfless
[1769.56 → 1770.14] suffering
[1770.14 → 1770.82] love for
[1770.82 → 1771.36] their sake
[1771.36 → 1772.28] forgive them
[1772.28 → 1772.78] show him
[1772.78 → 1773.14] mercy
[1773.14 → 1773.90] to fulfill
[1773.90 → 1774.70] your vocation
[1774.70 → 1775.72] then perhaps
[1775.72 → 1776.34] some of them
[1776.34 → 1777.02] will be drawn
[1777.02 → 1777.98] to the blessing
[1777.98 → 1779.34] that I intend
[1779.34 → 1780.48] for all of them
[1780.48 → 1781.94] so it's no
[1781.94 → 1782.50] accident
[1782.50 → 1784.02] that these words
[1784.02 → 1784.98] follow the
[1784.98 → 1785.62] Beatitudes
[1785.62 → 1786.78] no accident
[1786.78 → 1788.06] you see
[1788.06 → 1789.04] Isaiah had
[1789.04 → 1789.66] promised
[1789.66 → 1790.52] that when
[1790.52 → 1791.12] the Messiah
[1791.12 → 1791.88] comes
[1791.88 → 1793.56] Jerusalem
[1793.56 → 1794.08] would be
[1794.08 → 1795.02] this powerful
[1795.02 → 1796.28] city on a hill
[1796.28 → 1797.40] and the light
[1797.40 → 1798.10] would flow
[1798.10 → 1798.88] from that hill
[1798.88 → 1799.62] to the nations
[1799.62 → 1800.86] but what
[1800.86 → 1801.68] were the Jews
[1801.68 → 1802.42] believing about
[1802.42 → 1802.68] that
[1802.68 → 1803.18] those
[1803.18 → 1804.22] Asianic words
[1804.22 → 1805.34] they believed
[1805.34 → 1805.74] that when the
[1805.74 → 1806.56] Messiah was
[1806.56 → 1807.26] installed on
[1807.26 → 1807.54] Zion
[1807.54 → 1808.00] he would
[1808.00 → 1809.00] destroy his
[1809.00 → 1809.32] enemies
[1809.32 → 1810.36] and the light
[1810.36 → 1810.78] would just
[1810.78 → 1811.32] go to the
[1811.32 → 1811.76] Jews
[1811.76 → 1814.26] what Jesus
[1814.26 → 1814.92] is saying
[1814.92 → 1815.36] is if you
[1815.36 → 1816.16] live like this
[1816.16 → 1817.70] you are the
[1817.70 → 1818.20] light of the
[1818.20 → 1818.56] world
[1818.56 → 1820.08] you are the
[1820.08 → 1820.62] city on the
[1820.62 → 1820.76] hill
[1820.76 → 1821.74] you little
[1821.74 → 1822.22] disciple
[1822.22 → 1822.80] community
[1822.80 → 1823.52] not a
[1823.52 → 1824.06] powerful
[1824.06 → 1824.98] city on a
[1824.98 → 1825.14] hill
[1825.14 → 1826.00] you little
[1826.00 → 1826.42] disciple
[1826.42 → 1827.08] community
[1827.08 → 1828.06] are the
[1828.06 → 1829.58] people called
[1829.58 → 1830.10] to be a
[1830.10 → 1830.66] people of
[1830.66 → 1831.16] blessing
[1831.16 → 1832.60] a nation
[1832.60 → 1833.48] and a
[1833.48 → 1833.78] light
[1833.78 → 1836.00] I have
[1836.00 → 1836.80] no idea
[1836.80 → 1837.12] what the
[1837.12 → 1837.78] disciples were
[1837.78 → 1838.26] thinking at
[1838.26 → 1838.74] this point
[1838.74 → 1839.34] but I'm
[1839.34 → 1839.72] sure they're
[1839.72 → 1840.02] going
[1840.02 → 1844.04] what is
[1844.04 → 1844.88] he's talking
[1844.88 → 1845.30] about
[1845.30 → 1846.38] they would
[1846.38 → 1846.98] have recognized
[1846.98 → 1848.16] Isaiah's words
[1848.16 → 1849.26] he's talking
[1849.26 → 1849.86] to us
[1849.86 → 1850.50] a bunch
[1850.50 → 1850.66] of
[1850.66 → 1852.08] little group
[1852.08 → 1853.22] of 12
[1853.22 → 1854.50] nobodies
[1854.50 → 1856.10] yes he
[1856.10 → 1856.50] says
[1856.50 → 1856.94] if you
[1856.94 → 1857.46] live like
[1857.46 → 1857.92] this
[1857.92 → 1859.06] you shine
[1859.06 → 1859.48] your light
[1859.48 → 1860.12] before others
[1860.12 → 1860.58] so they can
[1860.58 → 1861.36] see your
[1861.36 → 1862.46] good deeds
[1862.46 → 1863.82] and those
[1863.82 → 1864.46] Romans that
[1864.46 → 1865.32] you all the
[1865.32 → 1865.68] rest of the
[1865.68 → 1866.08] Jews hate
[1866.08 → 1867.00] can glorify
[1867.00 → 1867.88] your father
[1867.88 → 1868.76] in heaven
[1868.76 → 1870.56] this is the
[1870.56 → 1870.90] way of
[1870.90 → 1871.40] blessing
[1871.40 → 1872.50] suffering
[1872.50 → 1872.98] love
[1872.98 → 1874.78] but there's
[1874.78 → 1875.42] no better
[1875.42 → 1875.98] picture
[1875.98 → 1877.26] of suffering
[1877.26 → 1877.76] love
[1877.76 → 1879.52] than Jesus
[1879.52 → 1880.72] himself
[1880.72 → 1881.90] you know
[1881.90 → 1882.28] it was one
[1882.28 → 1882.50] of the
[1882.50 → 1882.82] favourite
[1882.82 → 1883.52] pictures of
[1883.52 → 1884.06] the Messiah
[1884.06 → 1884.56] at this
[1884.56 → 1884.90] time
[1884.90 → 1886.40] it was
[1886.40 → 1886.76] of the
[1886.76 → 1887.44] Lion of
[1887.44 → 1887.92] Judah
[1887.92 → 1889.50] one who
[1889.50 → 1890.38] had powerful
[1890.38 → 1891.30] claws
[1891.30 → 1891.96] who would
[1891.96 → 1892.50] tear the
[1892.50 → 1893.24] enemies apart
[1893.24 → 1893.66] and they
[1893.66 → 1894.02] would sing
[1894.02 → 1894.88] songs about
[1894.88 → 1895.40] the coming
[1895.40 → 1895.68] of the
[1895.68 → 1896.20] Lion of
[1896.20 → 1896.58] Judah
[1896.58 → 1898.24] but the
[1898.24 → 1898.74] Lion of
[1898.74 → 1899.06] Judah
[1899.06 → 1900.20] as we see
[1900.20 → 1900.84] in Revelation
[1900.84 → 1902.42] became a
[1902.42 → 1903.10] slain lamb
[1903.10 → 1904.62] and what we
[1904.62 → 1905.16] see is not
[1905.16 → 1905.82] a warlike
[1905.82 → 1906.38] Messiah
[1906.38 → 1907.46] but we see
[1907.46 → 1908.78] a Messiah
[1908.78 → 1909.64] who loves
[1909.64 → 1910.44] his enemies
[1910.44 → 1911.88] including the
[1911.88 → 1912.48] Jews who
[1912.48 → 1912.88] have turned
[1912.88 → 1913.58] against him
[1913.58 → 1914.22] and are
[1914.22 → 1914.70] willing to
[1914.70 → 1915.40] take upon
[1915.40 → 1916.02] himself
[1916.02 → 1917.22] the curse
[1917.22 → 1918.40] and so
[1918.40 → 1919.02] Paul
[1919.02 → 1920.12] says these
[1920.12 → 1920.82] words in
[1920.82 → 1921.66] Galatians 3
[1921.66 → 1923.18] he says that
[1923.18 → 1923.82] Christ
[1923.82 → 1925.18] redeemed us
[1925.18 → 1926.22] and Paul is
[1926.22 → 1926.88] speaking as a
[1926.88 → 1927.40] Jew here
[1927.40 → 1928.92] from the
[1928.92 → 1929.90] curse of
[1929.90 → 1930.54] the law
[1930.54 → 1931.86] by becoming
[1931.86 → 1932.70] a curse
[1932.70 → 1933.60] for us
[1933.60 → 1935.08] we know
[1935.08 → 1936.00] Paul says
[1936.00 → 1936.76] as Jews
[1936.76 → 1937.36] we are living
[1937.36 → 1938.02] under the curse
[1938.02 → 1938.46] of the law
[1938.46 → 1938.94] and exile
[1938.94 → 1939.82] but Jesus
[1939.82 → 1940.68] comes and
[1940.68 → 1941.38] takes that
[1941.38 → 1942.24] curse for
[1942.24 → 1942.64] us
[1942.64 → 1943.58] on the
[1943.58 → 1944.12] cross
[1944.12 → 1944.88] cursed
[1944.88 → 1945.38] is everyone
[1945.38 → 1945.92] who hung
[1945.92 → 1946.52] on a pole
[1946.52 → 1947.52] and he
[1947.52 → 1947.90] redeemed
[1947.90 → 1948.60] us
[1948.60 → 1949.62] Israel
[1949.62 → 1950.76] in order
[1950.76 → 1951.56] that
[1951.56 → 1952.22] blessing
[1952.22 → 1952.88] might go
[1952.88 → 1953.82] from us
[1953.82 → 1954.76] to the
[1954.76 → 1955.72] Gentiles
[1955.72 → 1957.08] through Christ
[1957.08 → 1957.60] Jesus
[1957.60 → 1958.74] so that they
[1958.74 → 1959.42] might receive
[1959.42 → 1960.02] the promise
[1960.02 → 1960.32] of the
[1960.32 → 1960.68] Spirit
[1960.68 → 1962.38] Jesus
[1962.38 → 1963.18] has shown
[1963.18 → 1963.88] this suffering
[1963.88 → 1964.24] love
[1964.24 → 1964.90] taken the
[1964.90 → 1965.56] curse
[1965.56 → 1965.92] of his
[1965.92 → 1966.38] people
[1966.38 → 1967.14] on himself
[1967.14 → 1968.20] liberated
[1968.20 → 1969.18] them to live
[1969.18 → 1969.74] lives of
[1969.74 → 1970.22] blessings
[1970.22 → 1970.64] so the
[1970.64 → 1971.20] blessing
[1971.20 → 1972.18] might go
[1972.18 → 1972.48] to the
[1972.48 → 1973.20] Gentiles
[1973.20 → 1974.16] and so
[1974.16 → 1974.66] that's why
[1974.66 → 1975.26] he says
[1975.26 → 1975.84] just a few
[1975.84 → 1976.72] verses earlier
[1976.72 → 1978.02] scripture
[1978.02 → 1978.98] foresaw
[1978.98 → 1979.44] this
[1979.44 → 1981.26] and God
[1981.26 → 1982.20] himself
[1982.20 → 1983.18] listen to
[1983.18 → 1983.60] this
[1983.60 → 1985.22] God himself
[1985.22 → 1986.30] announced
[1986.30 → 1986.94] the
[1986.94 → 1988.02] gospel
[1988.02 → 1990.50] God
[1990.50 → 1991.04] himself
[1991.04 → 1991.62] announced
[1991.62 → 1992.54] the gospel
[1992.54 → 1993.36] in advance
[1993.36 → 1994.08] to Abraham
[1994.08 → 1995.60] all
[1995.60 → 1996.38] nations
[1996.38 → 1997.06] on
[1997.06 → 1997.64] earth
[1997.64 → 1998.08] will be
[1998.08 → 1998.68] blessed
[1998.68 → 1999.84] through
[1999.84 → 2000.22] you
[2000.22 → 2001.64] blessing
[2001.64 → 2002.34] comes
[2002.34 → 2002.82] through the
[2002.82 → 2003.32] cross
[2003.32 → 2004.70] through the
[2004.70 → 2005.26] resurrection
[2005.26 → 2006.30] for those
[2006.30 → 2006.90] who follow
[2006.90 → 2007.22] him
[2007.22 → 2007.68] those who
[2007.68 → 2008.30] trust in
[2008.30 → 2008.54] him
[2008.54 → 2009.36] those who
[2009.36 → 2010.16] obey him
[2010.16 → 2011.32] those who
[2011.32 → 2011.70] live
[2011.70 → 2012.68] by faith
[2012.68 → 2013.88] this is
[2013.88 → 2014.40] the only
[2014.40 → 2014.88] way
[2014.88 → 2016.04] that blessing
[2016.04 → 2017.08] can come
[2017.08 → 2017.82] to the
[2017.82 → 2018.26] nations
[2018.26 → 2019.94] and so we
[2019.94 → 2020.36] see
[2020.36 → 2021.42] that he
[2021.42 → 2022.04] redeems
[2022.04 → 2022.50] the people
[2022.50 → 2022.94] of God
[2022.94 → 2023.32] to be a
[2023.32 → 2023.70] blessing
[2023.70 → 2025.52] but what
[2025.52 → 2025.90] would that
[2025.90 → 2026.56] look like
[2026.56 → 2027.52] today
[2027.52 → 2028.94] what would
[2028.94 → 2029.38] it looks
[2029.38 → 2030.18] like today
[2030.18 → 2031.38] to be
[2031.38 → 2032.16] a people
[2032.16 → 2033.38] of blessing
[2033.38 → 2034.96] I don't
[2034.96 → 2035.24] know if you
[2035.24 → 2035.56] know that
[2035.56 → 2035.90] name
[2035.90 → 2036.46] Friedrich
[2036.46 → 2036.88] Nietzsche
[2036.88 → 2038.14] Friedrich
[2038.14 → 2038.48] Nietzsche
[2038.48 → 2039.24] is probably
[2039.24 → 2039.76] one of the
[2039.76 → 2041.16] most violent
[2041.16 → 2041.74] enemies
[2041.74 → 2042.02] of the
[2042.02 → 2042.34] Christian
[2042.34 → 2042.84] faith
[2042.84 → 2044.42] in the
[2044.42 → 2044.68] history
[2044.68 → 2045.08] of western
[2045.08 → 2045.78] civilization
[2045.78 → 2046.92] he hated
[2046.92 → 2047.40] Christ
[2047.40 → 2048.24] he hated
[2048.24 → 2048.76] he thought
[2048.76 → 2049.26] Christ was
[2049.26 → 2049.64] a wimp
[2049.64 → 2050.34] he hated
[2050.34 → 2050.94] Christians
[2050.94 → 2052.44] this is
[2052.44 → 2052.70] what he
[2052.70 → 2053.32] said once
[2053.32 → 2054.70] you want
[2054.70 → 2054.98] me to be
[2054.98 → 2055.46] a Christian
[2055.46 → 2057.20] they would
[2057.20 → 2057.62] have to
[2057.62 → 2058.44] sing better
[2058.44 → 2059.38] songs for
[2059.38 → 2060.14] me to
[2060.14 → 2060.84] learn to
[2060.84 → 2061.54] have faith
[2061.54 → 2061.92] in their
[2061.92 → 2062.34] redeemer
[2062.34 → 2064.10] and his
[2064.10 → 2064.74] disciples
[2064.74 → 2065.84] would have
[2065.84 → 2066.28] to look
[2066.28 → 2067.12] more redeemed
[2067.12 → 2068.82] or more
[2068.82 → 2069.54] blessed
[2069.54 → 2070.88] you want
[2070.88 → 2071.92] me to
[2071.92 → 2072.44] follow your
[2072.44 → 2072.88] Messiah
[2072.88 → 2073.78] than you
[2073.78 → 2074.62] better look
[2074.62 → 2076.08] more blessed
[2076.08 → 2078.88] suffering love
[2078.88 → 2079.40] of what it
[2079.40 → 2079.98] meant to look
[2079.98 → 2080.74] blessed at the
[2080.74 → 2081.46] time of Jesus
[2081.46 → 2082.12] what would that
[2082.12 → 2082.68] look like
[2082.68 → 2083.62] today
[2083.62 → 2086.60] maybe in a
[2086.60 → 2087.44] world of
[2087.44 → 2088.66] consumerism
[2088.66 → 2089.84] of
[2089.84 → 2090.64] accumulation
[2090.64 → 2092.02] of
[2092.02 → 2093.00] acquisitiveness
[2093.00 → 2094.68] maybe what
[2094.68 → 2095.34] Jesus would
[2095.34 → 2096.20] say is
[2096.20 → 2097.62] blessed
[2097.62 → 2098.86] are the
[2098.86 → 2099.62] generous
[2099.62 → 2101.58] blessed
[2101.58 → 2102.40] are those
[2102.40 → 2102.76] who are
[2102.76 → 2103.40] content
[2103.40 → 2104.42] with what
[2104.42 → 2104.98] they have
[2104.98 → 2106.18] blessed
[2106.18 → 2106.88] are those
[2106.88 → 2107.16] who are
[2107.16 → 2107.64] willing to
[2107.64 → 2108.42] live simply
[2108.42 → 2109.50] for the
[2109.50 → 2110.04] sake of
[2110.04 → 2110.46] blessing
[2110.46 → 2111.00] others
[2111.00 → 2112.46] for they
[2112.46 → 2113.72] shall know
[2113.72 → 2114.50] true
[2114.50 → 2115.64] life
[2115.64 → 2119.16] maybe
[2119.16 → 2120.24] he would
[2120.24 → 2120.88] say this
[2120.88 → 2122.14] in a world
[2122.14 → 2122.48] of
[2122.48 → 2123.98] selfishness
[2123.98 → 2125.52] and narcissism
[2125.52 → 2126.48] and self
[2126.48 → 2127.24] centredness
[2127.24 → 2128.44] he might
[2128.44 → 2128.84] say
[2128.84 → 2130.10] blessed
[2130.10 → 2131.34] are the
[2131.34 → 2132.08] selfless
[2132.08 → 2133.16] those who
[2133.16 → 2133.54] don't look
[2133.54 → 2134.18] after themselves
[2134.18 → 2134.94] first and
[2134.94 → 2135.46] foremost
[2135.46 → 2136.68] blessed are
[2136.68 → 2137.24] those who
[2137.24 → 2137.88] live in
[2137.88 → 2138.64] self giving
[2138.64 → 2139.18] love
[2139.18 → 2140.50] blessed are
[2140.50 → 2140.94] those who
[2140.94 → 2141.30] look out
[2141.30 → 2141.60] for the
[2141.60 → 2142.36] interests of
[2142.36 → 2143.50] others above
[2143.50 → 2144.16] themselves
[2144.16 → 2145.68] for they
[2145.68 → 2146.18] shall be
[2146.18 → 2146.90] satisfied
[2146.90 → 2148.22] isn't that
[2148.22 → 2148.82] what a
[2148.82 → 2149.58] consumer culture
[2149.58 → 2149.98] long for
[2149.98 → 2150.86] satisfaction
[2150.86 → 2151.94] you want to
[2151.94 → 2152.74] be satisfied
[2152.74 → 2153.92] look out for
[2153.92 → 2154.30] others
[2154.30 → 2157.84] in a world
[2157.84 → 2158.92] of contested
[2158.92 → 2159.56] truth
[2159.56 → 2161.66] when I train
[2161.66 → 2162.48] pastors in
[2162.48 → 2162.90] Phoenix
[2162.90 → 2164.04] the two things
[2164.04 → 2164.56] that are tearing
[2164.56 → 2165.26] the church apart
[2165.26 → 2166.54] most is the
[2166.54 → 2167.12] right left
[2167.12 → 2167.68] political
[2167.68 → 2168.30] spectrum
[2168.30 → 2169.70] and arguments
[2169.70 → 2170.44] over gender
[2170.44 → 2172.62] and sexuality
[2172.62 → 2174.10] this is what
[2174.10 → 2174.68] they're struggling
[2174.68 → 2175.18] with in their
[2175.18 → 2176.04] congregations
[2176.04 → 2177.70] and as they
[2177.70 → 2178.04] do
[2178.04 → 2178.78] we've talked a
[2178.78 → 2179.26] lot about
[2179.26 → 2179.66] this
[2179.66 → 2180.24] and wrestle
[2180.24 → 2180.84] with this
[2180.84 → 2181.94] maybe Jesus
[2181.94 → 2182.60] would say
[2182.60 → 2183.30] something like
[2183.30 → 2183.60] this
[2183.60 → 2184.16] blessed
[2184.16 → 2185.28] are those
[2185.28 → 2185.62] who are
[2185.62 → 2186.30] humble
[2186.30 → 2187.74] and bold
[2187.74 → 2189.28] those who
[2189.28 → 2190.04] are courageous
[2190.04 → 2191.88] and kind
[2191.88 → 2193.52] those who
[2193.52 → 2194.20] are welcoming
[2194.20 → 2195.88] and firm
[2195.88 → 2196.14] in their
[2196.14 → 2196.50] commitment
[2196.50 → 2197.06] to God's
[2197.06 → 2197.44] word
[2197.44 → 2198.52] blessed
[2198.52 → 2199.32] are those
[2199.32 → 2200.58] who live
[2200.58 → 2201.10] like that
[2201.10 → 2201.54] because they
[2201.54 → 2201.90] will bring
[2201.90 → 2202.54] peace
[2202.54 → 2203.76] and guide
[2203.76 → 2204.28] others
[2204.28 → 2204.90] in the path
[2204.90 → 2205.48] of life
[2205.48 → 2208.76] and finally
[2208.76 → 2210.66] in a world
[2210.66 → 2211.78] of entitlement
[2211.78 → 2213.80] I think about
[2213.80 → 2214.32] this a lot
[2214.32 → 2214.78] myself
[2214.78 → 2217.00] I'm almost
[2217.00 → 2217.52] 68
[2217.52 → 2218.88] so I'm
[2218.88 → 2219.60] getting targeted
[2219.60 → 2220.30] a lot
[2220.30 → 2221.60] when I watch
[2221.60 → 2222.38] football games
[2222.38 → 2222.98] and they're
[2222.98 → 2223.62] telling me
[2223.62 → 2225.08] you're going
[2225.08 → 2225.48] to retire
[2225.48 → 2225.84] soon
[2225.84 → 2226.26] aren't you
[2226.26 → 2227.70] you've worked
[2227.70 → 2228.12] hard all
[2228.12 → 2228.64] your life
[2228.64 → 2230.34] you deserve
[2230.34 → 2232.50] you deserve
[2232.50 → 2233.34] to live
[2233.34 → 2233.98] like this
[2233.98 → 2235.22] you deserve
[2235.22 → 2235.76] to forget
[2235.76 → 2236.30] about the rest
[2236.30 → 2236.86] of your family
[2236.86 → 2237.48] you deserve
[2237.48 → 2238.50] to live
[2238.50 → 2239.70] this life
[2239.70 → 2240.14] just like
[2240.14 → 2240.46] you've been
[2240.46 → 2240.94] living it
[2240.94 → 2241.82] and to enjoy
[2241.82 → 2242.72] life to the
[2242.72 → 2242.98] full
[2242.98 → 2244.94] I think
[2244.94 → 2245.68] sometimes
[2245.68 → 2246.48] maybe our
[2246.48 → 2247.02] generation
[2247.02 → 2247.54] is the most
[2247.54 → 2248.02] entitled
[2248.02 → 2248.62] even though
[2248.62 → 2250.00] we accuse
[2250.00 → 2250.42] others
[2250.42 → 2251.12] younger
[2251.12 → 2252.32] generations
[2252.32 → 2253.88] but we
[2253.88 → 2254.26] are an
[2254.26 → 2254.74] entitled
[2254.74 → 2255.24] people
[2255.24 → 2255.56] because we
[2255.56 → 2255.94] have so
[2255.94 → 2256.30] much
[2256.30 → 2257.44] and in a
[2257.44 → 2257.90] world of
[2257.90 → 2258.58] entitlement
[2258.58 → 2260.32] maybe Jesus
[2260.32 → 2261.00] would say
[2261.00 → 2262.22] blessed
[2262.22 → 2263.24] are the
[2263.24 → 2263.82] thankful
[2263.82 → 2265.76] blessed
[2265.76 → 2266.54] are those
[2266.54 → 2267.58] that delight
[2267.58 → 2267.92] in what
[2267.92 → 2268.24] they've been
[2268.24 → 2268.52] given
[2268.52 → 2269.24] and hold
[2269.24 → 2270.00] those things
[2270.00 → 2270.72] loosely
[2270.72 → 2271.26] for the
[2271.26 → 2271.66] sake of
[2271.66 → 2272.04] others
[2272.04 → 2273.04] but live
[2273.04 → 2273.56] with deep
[2273.56 → 2274.10] gratitude
[2274.10 → 2274.66] knowing
[2274.66 → 2275.50] we deserve
[2275.50 → 2275.96] nothing
[2275.96 → 2277.84] for they
[2277.84 → 2279.40] will know
[2279.40 → 2279.98] true
[2279.98 → 2280.80] joy
[2280.80 → 2283.32] I'll give
[2283.32 → 2283.78] you a
[2283.78 → 2284.08] homework
[2284.08 → 2284.64] assignment
[2284.64 → 2285.16] this
[2285.16 → 2285.56] afternoon
[2285.56 → 2286.24] make up
[2286.24 → 2286.68] your own
[2286.68 → 2287.26] beatitudes
[2287.26 → 2288.84] think about
[2288.84 → 2289.56] the powerful
[2289.56 → 2290.46] streams
[2290.46 → 2290.78] that are
[2290.78 → 2291.36] trying to
[2291.36 → 2292.02] push us
[2292.02 → 2292.68] in a certain
[2292.68 → 2293.10] direction
[2293.10 → 2293.48] and say
[2293.48 → 2294.14] what does
[2294.14 → 2294.70] it means
[2294.70 → 2295.12] to live
[2295.12 → 2295.44] as a
[2295.44 → 2295.80] blessed
[2295.80 → 2296.34] people
[2296.34 → 2297.60] that walk
[2297.60 → 2298.36] against
[2298.36 → 2299.18] the stream
[2299.18 → 2302.28] the story
[2302.28 → 2302.58] is going
[2302.58 → 2303.00] to end
[2303.00 → 2303.36] in the
[2303.36 → 2303.64] book of
[2303.64 → 2304.12] revelation
[2304.12 → 2305.30] and one
[2305.30 → 2305.52] of the
[2305.52 → 2305.90] things we
[2305.90 → 2306.14] know
[2306.14 → 2306.44] that in
[2306.44 → 2306.70] the book
[2306.70 → 2307.28] of revelation
[2307.28 → 2307.66] whenever
[2307.66 → 2308.34] something
[2308.34 → 2308.90] is repeated
[2308.90 → 2309.74] seven times
[2309.74 → 2310.04] is meant
[2310.04 → 2310.38] to show
[2310.38 → 2310.86] fullness
[2310.86 → 2311.88] and there
[2311.88 → 2312.18] is a
[2312.18 → 2312.70] seven
[2312.70 → 2313.22] fold
[2313.22 → 2313.78] blessing
[2313.78 → 2314.44] that comes
[2314.44 → 2314.68] in the
[2314.68 → 2314.98] book of
[2314.98 → 2315.46] revelation
[2315.46 → 2316.58] showing
[2316.58 → 2318.06] that the
[2318.06 → 2318.68] fullness
[2318.68 → 2319.56] of blessing
[2319.56 → 2319.92] that was
[2319.92 → 2320.48] given to
[2320.48 → 2320.96] Adam and
[2320.96 → 2321.24] Eve in
[2321.24 → 2321.72] the garden
[2321.72 → 2322.62] is going
[2322.62 → 2322.90] to be
[2322.90 → 2323.60] restored
[2323.60 → 2324.16] to his
[2324.16 → 2324.70] people
[2324.70 → 2325.34] his
[2325.34 → 2325.98] resurrected
[2325.98 → 2326.58] people
[2326.58 → 2327.24] on the
[2327.24 → 2327.42] new
[2327.42 → 2327.78] earth
[2327.78 → 2329.30] and the
[2329.30 → 2329.76] last
[2329.76 → 2330.08] of that
[2330.08 → 2330.42] seven
[2330.42 → 2330.66] fold
[2330.66 → 2331.02] blessing
[2331.02 → 2331.40] is found
[2331.40 → 2331.66] in the
[2331.66 → 2331.96] last
[2331.96 → 2332.42] chapter
[2332.42 → 2333.40] of revelation
[2333.40 → 2333.80] nearing
[2333.80 → 2334.28] the end
[2334.28 → 2334.56] and it
[2334.56 → 2334.82] says
[2334.82 → 2335.38] blessed
[2335.38 → 2336.30] are those
[2336.30 → 2337.46] who wash
[2337.46 → 2338.36] their robes
[2338.36 → 2338.96] that they
[2338.96 → 2339.74] may have
[2339.74 → 2340.48] the right
[2340.48 → 2340.86] to the
[2340.86 → 2341.36] tree of
[2341.36 → 2341.76] life
[2341.76 → 2342.72] and might
[2342.72 → 2343.34] go into
[2343.34 → 2343.90] the city
[2343.90 → 2345.60] what is
[2345.60 → 2346.22] that city
[2346.22 → 2347.64] that city
[2347.64 → 2348.24] I think
[2348.24 → 2348.98] Tim Sheridan
[2348.98 → 2349.62] preached on
[2349.62 → 2350.10] it just a
[2350.10 → 2350.70] few weeks
[2350.70 → 2351.06] ago
[2351.06 → 2352.30] that city
[2352.30 → 2353.60] is God's
[2353.60 → 2354.44] dwelling place
[2354.44 → 2355.42] coming out
[2355.42 → 2356.04] of heaven
[2356.04 → 2357.20] down to
[2357.20 → 2357.72] the earth
[2357.72 → 2358.70] it's not
[2358.70 → 2359.44] human beings
[2359.44 → 2359.98] going to
[2359.98 → 2360.30] heaven
[2360.30 → 2361.50] it's God's
[2361.50 → 2362.30] city coming
[2362.30 → 2363.00] to earth
[2363.00 → 2363.86] and then
[2363.86 → 2364.28] what we
[2364.28 → 2364.92] hear is
[2364.92 → 2365.56] the loud
[2365.56 → 2366.12] voice
[2366.12 → 2366.72] says
[2366.72 → 2367.58] now
[2367.58 → 2368.52] the dwelling
[2368.52 → 2369.70] of God
[2369.70 → 2370.40] is with
[2370.40 → 2371.14] humanity
[2371.14 → 2372.54] God
[2372.54 → 2373.04] has come
[2373.04 → 2373.56] back to
[2373.56 → 2374.42] dwell fully
[2374.42 → 2374.84] with his
[2374.84 → 2375.28] people
[2375.28 → 2376.30] and now
[2376.30 → 2376.88] there will
[2376.88 → 2377.40] be the
[2377.40 → 2377.80] fullness
[2377.80 → 2378.68] of blessing
[2378.68 → 2379.40] again
[2379.40 → 2380.66] human beings
[2380.66 → 2381.04] will than
[2381.04 → 2381.76] delight in
[2381.76 → 2382.44] his presence

[2385.14 → 2385.96] to experience
[2385.96 → 2386.66] the blessing
[2386.66 → 2387.38] that God
[2387.38 → 2388.08] intended
[2388.08 → 2389.04] from the
[2389.04 → 2389.40] beginning
[2389.40 → 2391.94] and what
[2391.94 → 2392.30] will that
[2392.30 → 2392.98] blessing look

[2393.36 → 2395.74] it will
[2395.74 → 2396.70] be walking
[2396.70 → 2397.46] for me
[2397.46 → 2397.62] it will
[2397.62 → 2398.16] be walking

[2398.68 → 2399.34] coffee

[2402.28 → 2402.76] be enjoying
[2402.76 → 2403.48] the oldies
[2403.48 → 2404.90] purged of
[2404.90 → 2405.38] maybe some
[2405.38 → 2405.86] of the stuff
[2405.86 → 2406.22] that shouldn't
[2406.22 → 2406.72] be in there
[2406.72 → 2408.84] it will be
[2408.84 → 2409.76] eating spaghetti
[2409.76 → 2410.42] even better
[2410.42 → 2410.90] than what I
[2410.90 → 2411.36] had this
[2411.36 → 2411.74] week
[2411.74 → 2413.18] it will
[2413.18 → 2413.50] have even
[2413.50 → 2414.70] more time
[2414.70 → 2415.40] to spend
[2415.40 → 2415.90] with Ben

[2453.30 → 2454.00] once a week
[2454.00 → 2454.40] where we'll
[2454.40 → 2455.12] gather in an
[2455.12 → 2456.16] incredible time
[2456.16 → 2457.06] of praise
[2457.06 → 2458.30] to the God
[2458.30 → 2458.72] who in his
[2458.72 → 2459.44] goodness and
[2459.44 → 2459.86] wisdom
[2459.86 → 2460.88] has given
[2460.88 → 2461.44] us these
[2461.44 → 2461.88] things
[2461.88 → 2463.38] and praising

[2507.44 → 2507.90] and a
[2507.90 → 2508.32] faithful
[2508.32 → 2508.74] and a
[2508.74 → 2509.06] gracious
[2509.06 → 2509.56] God
[2509.56 → 2510.08] that not
[2510.08 → 2510.72] did not
[2510.72 → 2511.42] abandon
[2511.42 → 2511.74] this
[2511.74 → 2512.36] creation
[2512.36 → 2512.90] to its
[2512.90 → 2513.38] curse
[2513.38 → 2515.02] did not
[2515.02 → 2515.42] let that
[2515.42 → 2515.80] go
[2515.80 → 2516.98] but set
[2516.98 → 2517.30] out on
[2517.30 → 2518.04] that long
[2518.04 → 2518.52] road
[2518.52 → 2519.28] to restore
[2519.28 → 2519.92] blessing
[2519.92 → 2521.26] to your
[2521.26 → 2521.82] creation

[2530.76 → 2531.28] more of
[2531.28 → 2531.92] his spirit
[2531.92 → 2532.88] may we
[2532.88 → 2534.00] show the
[2534.00 → 2534.58] world what
[2534.58 → 2535.08] it truly
[2535.08 → 2535.80] means to
[2535.80 → 2536.36] be human
[2536.36 → 2537.68] even as
[2537.68 → 2539.48] it contradicts
[2539.48 → 2540.52] the idolatrous
[2540.52 → 2541.78] currents that
[2541.78 → 2542.48] bring death
[2542.48 → 2543.22] and curse
[2543.22 → 2544.90] oh Lord
[2544.90 → 2545.58] pour out your
[2545.58 → 2546.50] spirit on us
[2546.50 → 2547.70] that we might
[2547.70 → 2548.72] walk with you
[2548.72 → 2549.58] more faithfully
[2549.58 → 2551.22] in the path
[2551.22 → 2551.86] of blessing
[2551.86 → 2553.44] we pray in
