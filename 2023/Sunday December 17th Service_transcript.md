[0.00 --> 29.98]  Thank you.
[30.00 --> 59.98]  Thank you.
[60.00 --> 89.98]  Thank you.
[90.00 --> 119.98]  Thank you.
[120.00 --> 122.00]  Thank you.
[122.00 --> 124.00]  Thank you.
[124.00 --> 126.00]  Thank you.
[126.00 --> 128.00]  Thank you.
[128.00 --> 130.00]  Thank you.
[130.00 --> 132.00]  Thank you.
[132.00 --> 134.00]  Thank you.
[134.00 --> 136.00]  Thank you.
[136.00 --> 138.00]  Thank you.
[138.00 --> 140.00]  Thank you.
[140.00 --> 142.00]  Thank you.
[142.00 --> 144.00]  Thank you.
[144.00 --> 146.00]  Thank you.
[146.00 --> 148.00]  Thank you.
[148.00 --> 150.00]  Thank you.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  Thank you.
[152.00 --> 154.00]  Thank you.
[156.00 --> 158.00]  Thank you.
[158.00 --> 160.00]  Thank you.
[160.00 --> 165.84]  Lindy, as a teenager, going through a rebellious, frustrating stage with her parents, decides to run away.
[166.80 --> 170.02]  And Michael and Pauline, sort of aware that teenagers can do this,
[170.44 --> 173.54]  were assuming that she would eventually come back, but she doesn't.
[174.52 --> 177.82]  And she eventually becomes what people classify as a missing person.
[179.02 --> 185.34]  And really, the story tells of the kind of watchful waiting that the family has in Lindy's absence.
[186.18 --> 191.74]  Michael and Pauline just become experts, you might say, at gathering clues and evidence as to where Lindy could have gone.
[192.34 --> 196.46]  The reason she wouldn't have come home, who she could possibly be with,
[196.72 --> 198.98]  and how they could hold hope for her still being alive.
[199.90 --> 204.64]  The novel tells of how whenever Pauline walks around the house and she sees the front window,
[204.64 --> 209.74]  she looks out the front window with a glimmer of hope that somehow she'll see Lindy walking down the driveway.
[209.74 --> 216.02]  When they go to bed at night, they're often listening for the sound of the front door latch opening
[216.02 --> 218.82]  and Lindy's feet walking through the front hallway.
[219.60 --> 222.82]  Whenever the phone rings, they pick it up immediately before the second ring
[222.82 --> 227.58]  because they just hope maybe it's Lindy or the police telling them that they've found her.
[228.88 --> 233.82]  The novel does a fascinating, marvelous job at describing family members and friends
[233.82 --> 242.16]  trying to move on with their lives, to live their lives, while still holding some kind of hope that Lindy's coming home.
[243.92 --> 250.62]  Now, I share this story from this novel because I think it gives us a sense of the world Jesus was born into.
[251.42 --> 254.60]  A world that actually is quite removed from our own cultural moment.
[254.60 --> 260.76]  When Jesus was born, he was born into a community that was watching and waiting.
[260.76 --> 267.68]  He was born into a family, the Israelite family, that was fervently praying with desperation
[267.68 --> 271.24]  that they would meet and see a Savior.
[272.92 --> 275.26]  Jesus was born into a watching world.
[276.72 --> 279.38]  And our passage this morning is about one of those people.
[279.88 --> 280.64]  It's about Simeon.
[281.54 --> 284.40]  And you should know that we know very little about Simeon.
[284.48 --> 287.12]  When I was reading commentaries, there's just so little information.
[287.24 --> 288.60]  What we know comes from Luke 2.
[289.14 --> 290.18]  He was an older man.
[290.18 --> 291.82]  He loved the Lord.
[292.24 --> 295.82]  And it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die
[295.82 --> 299.04]  before seeing with his own eyes the Messiah.
[299.68 --> 301.20]  It's quite something to have revealed to you.
[301.56 --> 303.54]  Imagine how that would have shaped his life.
[304.14 --> 307.68]  And there's a verse in this passage that caught my attention and I want to read for you.
[307.74 --> 309.54]  It's a very short verse, verse 25,
[309.90 --> 313.20]  that captures how Simeon falls into the story of his people.
[313.60 --> 314.76]  We read in verse 25,
[314.76 --> 317.26]  He was devout and it says,
[317.60 --> 321.38]  He was waiting for the consolation of Israel.
[322.02 --> 327.64]  Other translations will say he was waiting for the rescue of Israel or he's waiting for the restoration of Israel.
[327.64 --> 331.28]  Simeon was part of the people that was clinging to hope.
[331.28 --> 334.48]  That God promised renewal.
[334.96 --> 340.28]  God promised to deal with the brutal wickedness of sin, the violence and injustice of the world.
[340.66 --> 342.24]  And Simeon had the guts to say,
[342.78 --> 344.12]  I'm going to see that Savior.
[344.78 --> 346.80]  I'm going to hold on to hope.
[347.02 --> 349.08]  I'm going to wait for that to happen.
[349.08 --> 352.02]  Now you might not like to hear this,
[352.10 --> 353.74]  but let me tell you something that's true about the Bible.
[354.40 --> 358.44]  It contains a ridiculous amount of waiting.
[358.98 --> 360.18]  If you read this story,
[360.26 --> 362.20]  you're going to encounter person after person,
[362.56 --> 364.74]  community after community that is waiting.
[365.42 --> 366.52]  God makes promises,
[366.98 --> 368.54]  people receive those with joy,
[368.62 --> 371.82]  and then they wait for the moment where it comes to fruition.
[371.98 --> 373.38]  Let me give you just a few examples.
[375.00 --> 376.92]  Moses, waiting 40 years.
[376.92 --> 381.02]  Moses, Noah, waiting 120 years.
[381.72 --> 386.98]  Abraham, waiting his whole life so that he could have a child with his wife.
[388.46 --> 390.56]  And I'm sure many people then, just like now,
[390.90 --> 392.72]  have questions about God's timeline,
[393.26 --> 396.70]  why God seems so slow in accomplishing what he promised to do,
[397.10 --> 398.80]  and yet they wait.
[399.82 --> 401.22]  And perhaps we should all marvel,
[401.32 --> 402.54]  I certainly did this week,
[402.54 --> 407.04]  at how 400 years passes between Malachi and Matthew.
[407.38 --> 408.58]  Silence from God.
[408.84 --> 409.98]  No prophetic words,
[410.28 --> 411.28]  no rising up,
[411.36 --> 413.72]  no special thing that God speaks to his people.
[413.96 --> 415.56]  And after 400 years,
[415.88 --> 416.88]  there's Zechariah,
[417.62 --> 418.42]  there's Mary,
[418.96 --> 419.78]  there's Simeon,
[419.86 --> 420.58]  there's Anna,
[420.58 --> 424.36]  fervently praying for the Messiah to come.
[425.30 --> 427.12]  One commentator wisely pointed out
[427.12 --> 429.06]  that every character in the beginning of Luke
[429.06 --> 430.56]  is fervently waiting.
[431.26 --> 432.70]  In fact, I would suggest to you
[432.70 --> 436.18]  that the reason there's so much singing in Luke 1 and Luke 2
[436.18 --> 439.34]  is because these people have been anticipating for this day
[439.34 --> 440.78]  their whole lives.
[440.78 --> 442.44]  So when they see Jesus,
[442.54 --> 443.24]  they hold Jesus,
[443.44 --> 444.72]  they break into song
[444.72 --> 448.66]  because they have been fervently anticipating this arrival.
[450.06 --> 453.36]  And there's no doubt there would be people that lost hope.
[454.20 --> 455.78]  There would be people that were part of Israel
[455.78 --> 457.48]  that said this can't be the case.
[457.86 --> 459.84]  God would not possibly wait this long.
[460.78 --> 463.14]  But then there's the Simeons of the world.
[463.58 --> 466.52]  And we get to read of Simeon's day coming.
[467.00 --> 468.86]  I mean, just try to imagine
[468.86 --> 470.24]  what it would be like to be Simeon.
[470.24 --> 471.54]  His whole life,
[472.20 --> 474.56]  patiently knowing his day is coming.
[474.66 --> 476.12]  Probably even at moments doubting
[476.12 --> 477.48]  that the Spirit spoke these words.
[477.76 --> 478.66]  But then it comes.
[479.12 --> 479.24]  Right?
[479.30 --> 481.44]  The Spirit moves Simeon to go into the temple.
[481.88 --> 483.10]  He sees Mary and Joseph.
[483.58 --> 484.98]  And he knows.
[485.64 --> 487.42]  He just knows
[487.42 --> 490.08]  that that child that Mary and Joseph are holding
[490.08 --> 491.76]  is the child.
[492.30 --> 494.14]  And he does what I think any one of us would do
[494.14 --> 494.80]  in that circumstance.
[495.22 --> 497.48]  He steals the child from Mary and Joseph.
[497.48 --> 498.82]  He holds the child.
[498.82 --> 500.36]  And he praises God.
[500.82 --> 501.98]  And let me read for us again
[501.98 --> 503.58]  the Song of Simeon.
[504.70 --> 505.56]  This is what he praises.
[506.62 --> 508.96]  Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,
[509.88 --> 512.58]  you may now dismiss your servant in peace.
[513.16 --> 516.08]  For my eyes have seen your salvation,
[516.50 --> 517.58]  which you have prepared
[517.58 --> 519.28]  in the sight of all the nations,
[519.96 --> 522.08]  a light of revelation to the Gentiles,
[522.08 --> 525.74]  and the glory of your people Israel.
[527.40 --> 528.72]  Simeon's basically saying,
[529.52 --> 531.88]  Lord, I can die now
[531.88 --> 533.52]  because I've seen Jesus.
[534.24 --> 538.12]  I have seen the long-awaited Messiah.
[539.08 --> 540.42]  And as we've said throughout this series,
[540.54 --> 542.78]  that whenever these songs in Luke 2 show up,
[542.92 --> 544.30]  they are loaded,
[544.46 --> 546.72]  full of Old Testament allusions and references.
[546.72 --> 548.96]  And Pastor Sid started our service
[548.96 --> 550.54]  with the song,
[550.72 --> 551.66]  or the passage,
[552.22 --> 553.72]  that this one rings back to,
[553.78 --> 554.92]  and that is Isaiah 60.
[555.60 --> 558.04]  Isaiah 60 just gives this amazing image
[558.04 --> 560.92]  of the glory of the Lord invading his world.
[561.56 --> 563.54]  The nation seeing the light of God
[563.54 --> 564.70]  and being drawn into it.
[564.74 --> 566.22]  It's just an incredible image.
[566.56 --> 567.94]  And Simeon, in his song,
[568.04 --> 568.84]  holding Jesus,
[569.18 --> 571.20]  is pulling into his heart and mind
[571.20 --> 572.20]  and to his song,
[572.20 --> 575.04]  a praise that this child somehow
[575.04 --> 577.30]  is the light to the nations.
[577.80 --> 578.98]  This child somehow
[578.98 --> 580.74]  is the salvation of the world.
[581.04 --> 582.62]  This child somehow is the light
[582.62 --> 583.52]  that will push away
[583.52 --> 584.58]  the darkness of the world.
[584.96 --> 586.08]  It's a beautiful thing.
[586.60 --> 588.24]  So fulfilling to Simeon
[588.24 --> 588.74]  that he says,
[589.08 --> 589.78]  I can die.
[590.26 --> 591.16]  I'm full of peace.
[591.54 --> 592.36]  I've seen Jesus.
[594.78 --> 596.38]  Now it's fair to say that,
[596.60 --> 597.66]  at least in my mind,
[597.70 --> 598.78]  it's very unlikely
[598.78 --> 601.28]  that Simeon lived long enough
[601.28 --> 603.40]  to see what Jesus did.
[604.20 --> 605.26]  It's probably the case
[605.26 --> 606.30]  that he wasn't around
[606.30 --> 607.58]  for Jesus' public ministry
[607.58 --> 608.36]  where he healed.
[608.84 --> 610.62]  He announced the presence of the kingdom.
[610.92 --> 612.10]  He forgave sins.
[612.24 --> 614.00]  He demonstrated all the life
[614.00 --> 614.82]  of the kingdom of God.
[615.02 --> 616.78]  It's very unlikely Simeon saw that,
[617.40 --> 618.96]  much less witnessed the death
[618.96 --> 620.12]  and the resurrection of Jesus.
[621.20 --> 622.06]  And that means that Simeon
[622.06 --> 623.50]  also did not see the way,
[623.60 --> 624.60]  the power of Jesus,
[624.74 --> 625.80]  his resurrection life,
[626.06 --> 627.86]  was poured out onto the church.
[628.58 --> 630.42]  Now the church then started to grow
[630.42 --> 631.42]  and multiply.
[631.42 --> 633.04]  It moved from Jerusalem
[633.04 --> 634.02]  to Judea,
[634.14 --> 635.04]  to Samaria,
[635.20 --> 636.90]  and to British Columbia.
[637.82 --> 639.40]  I mean, I often think to myself,
[639.50 --> 641.26]  could Simeon even fathom
[641.26 --> 644.34]  a church at the ends of the earth?
[644.42 --> 645.58]  That's British Columbia, by the way.
[645.90 --> 646.66]  You look at Jerusalem,
[646.92 --> 647.80]  British Columbia is
[647.80 --> 648.80]  at the ends of the earth.
[648.98 --> 649.90]  And here we are,
[650.64 --> 651.90]  thousands of years later,
[652.34 --> 653.82]  worshiping Jesus Christ,
[654.02 --> 655.32]  celebrating the incarnation
[655.32 --> 656.80]  at the time of Christmas.
[656.80 --> 658.86]  It's a beautiful thing.
[658.98 --> 660.76]  The fulfillment of Isaiah 60.
[661.08 --> 661.74]  We live.
[662.54 --> 663.82]  But Simeon never saw that.
[665.18 --> 666.56]  And it seems to me
[666.56 --> 668.00]  that one of the things
[668.00 --> 669.60]  that would have blown Simeon's mind
[669.60 --> 672.44]  is that after Jesus' death
[672.44 --> 673.06]  and resurrection,
[673.74 --> 675.06]  we still have to wait.
[676.40 --> 678.36]  I mean, that is one of the confusing things
[678.36 --> 679.22]  for the early believers,
[679.34 --> 680.62]  that when Jesus came
[680.62 --> 681.98]  and he died,
[682.24 --> 683.38]  he defeated this cross,
[683.60 --> 684.96]  we still have to wait.
[684.96 --> 686.66]  Let me frame it this way.
[686.94 --> 688.36]  We know that Jesus came
[688.36 --> 690.40]  to defeat the power of Satan,
[690.82 --> 693.90]  but we still feel Satan's temptation, right?
[694.50 --> 696.10]  We know that Jesus came
[696.10 --> 697.32]  to take on himself
[697.32 --> 698.74]  the sin of the world
[698.74 --> 699.94]  and bring it to the grave,
[700.26 --> 701.78]  but man, do we still wrestle
[701.78 --> 703.18]  with disordered desires
[703.18 --> 704.80]  and destructive habits
[704.80 --> 706.34]  that ruin families and relationships.
[707.26 --> 710.12]  We know that Jesus defeated the grave
[710.12 --> 711.18]  and death itself
[711.18 --> 713.78]  as he rose victorious from the grave,
[713.78 --> 716.30]  but we still grieve death.
[716.82 --> 717.66]  I mean, even yesterday,
[717.78 --> 718.82]  in this very space,
[719.18 --> 720.38]  the Lessard family gathered
[720.38 --> 722.00]  to grieve the loss of their mother.
[722.54 --> 723.48]  And there were tears
[723.48 --> 724.68]  because we're facing
[724.68 --> 725.88]  the reality of death.
[726.62 --> 728.34]  And one of the mysterious realities
[728.34 --> 729.30]  we need to name
[729.30 --> 731.00]  is that between the time
[731.00 --> 732.70]  of Jesus' resurrection and return,
[733.06 --> 735.12]  we're still waiting.
[736.26 --> 738.44]  And maybe we don't talk about that enough,
[739.44 --> 740.74]  that to join the church
[740.74 --> 742.28]  is to join a community
[742.28 --> 743.38]  that, yes, is filled
[743.38 --> 744.24]  with the life of Jesus,
[744.68 --> 746.16]  that, yes, has the power
[746.16 --> 746.88]  of the resurrection
[746.88 --> 748.34]  shaping, transforming,
[748.50 --> 749.66]  and renewing our lives,
[749.84 --> 751.20]  but we're still waiting.
[752.04 --> 752.96]  We're still struggling.
[753.22 --> 754.14]  We still grieve
[754.14 --> 755.84]  the broken, heavy darkness
[755.84 --> 756.64]  in our world,
[756.70 --> 759.06]  and we still want renewal.
[761.70 --> 764.02]  This week, I came across a quote
[764.02 --> 765.28]  that I have come across
[765.28 --> 766.18]  a few times now.
[766.18 --> 767.94]  It's by a French philosopher
[767.94 --> 769.06]  named Simone Weil.
[769.86 --> 771.38]  Very simple sentence
[771.38 --> 773.00]  that I find very challenging.
[773.14 --> 773.92]  I'll read it for you.
[775.74 --> 776.38]  She writes,
[776.76 --> 777.82]  Waiting patiently
[777.82 --> 779.76]  in expectation
[779.76 --> 782.02]  is the foundation
[782.02 --> 783.82]  of the spiritual life.
[784.84 --> 786.14]  And let me just be transparent with you.
[786.18 --> 787.36]  I don't like this quote.
[788.46 --> 788.58]  Right?
[788.96 --> 789.96]  Waiting patiently
[789.96 --> 791.50]  in expectation
[791.50 --> 793.10]  is the foundation
[793.10 --> 794.68]  of the spiritual life.
[794.68 --> 796.90]  And I'm guessing
[796.90 --> 797.32]  you're thinking
[797.32 --> 797.96]  what I'm thinking.
[799.16 --> 800.52]  We're terrible at waiting.
[801.54 --> 802.62]  And if you grew up
[802.62 --> 803.56]  in Western society
[803.56 --> 804.38]  or you've been immersed
[804.38 --> 805.22]  in it long enough,
[805.48 --> 806.62]  you will be shaped
[806.62 --> 808.86]  by the instant gratification,
[809.56 --> 811.22]  impossible waiting culture
[811.22 --> 812.36]  that we live in.
[812.96 --> 813.20]  Right?
[813.26 --> 814.22]  Let me name that for us.
[814.46 --> 815.24]  We live in a culture
[815.24 --> 816.44]  where we drive-through
[816.44 --> 817.26]  used to be impressive.
[817.68 --> 818.88]  Now drive-through's the old thing.
[818.92 --> 820.00]  Now we just get Uber Eats
[820.00 --> 820.68]  and people deliver it
[820.68 --> 821.34]  right to our door.
[821.34 --> 822.54]  We don't even have to get
[822.54 --> 824.16]  in the car to eat.
[825.30 --> 826.38]  We live in a culture
[826.38 --> 827.76]  where you can have any movie,
[827.92 --> 828.56]  TV show,
[828.76 --> 829.52]  and stream it,
[829.90 --> 830.64]  binge watch it
[830.64 --> 831.54]  as much as you want,
[831.64 --> 832.70]  as often as you want,
[832.82 --> 833.66]  whenever you want.
[834.26 --> 834.46]  I mean,
[834.52 --> 835.74]  now our TVs are so sophisticated.
[836.08 --> 836.72]  You don't even have
[836.72 --> 837.46]  to watch commercials.
[837.56 --> 838.54]  You can fast forward them.
[839.56 --> 839.98]  And, you know,
[840.02 --> 840.90]  we have new upgrades
[840.90 --> 841.60]  of every week,
[841.90 --> 842.48]  new phones
[842.48 --> 843.24]  that are being replacing
[843.24 --> 843.80]  old phones.
[843.94 --> 846.80]  We live in a constant life
[846.80 --> 848.36]  of getting what we want
[848.36 --> 848.76]  right away.
[848.76 --> 849.76]  There's an army
[849.76 --> 851.92]  of Amazon delivery trucks.
[852.46 --> 853.06]  Some of them probably
[853.06 --> 853.58]  have packages
[853.58 --> 854.96]  that you ordered last night
[854.96 --> 855.98]  that might arrive
[855.98 --> 857.16]  before you get home
[857.16 --> 857.86]  from church.
[859.16 --> 860.56]  Instant gratification culture.
[861.36 --> 862.74]  That's only one part
[862.74 --> 863.68]  of the problem, though.
[864.44 --> 865.10]  It's not just that
[865.10 --> 865.82]  we're bad at waiting.
[865.90 --> 866.50]  I have a deeper,
[866.74 --> 866.96]  harder,
[867.10 --> 867.76]  and more uncomfortable
[867.76 --> 868.72]  question for us all
[868.72 --> 869.24]  to sit with.
[869.30 --> 869.92]  Are you ready for it?
[869.96 --> 870.70]  You're not going to like it.
[871.88 --> 873.52]  Are we even waiting at all?
[873.52 --> 876.32]  Are we waiting
[876.32 --> 877.36]  for Jesus to come back?
[879.16 --> 880.38]  I'm asking that honestly.
[881.26 --> 882.22]  Could it be said
[882.22 --> 883.50]  of the church in 2023
[883.50 --> 884.36]  here in Surrey,
[884.42 --> 884.86]  British Columbia,
[885.14 --> 885.88]  those Christians
[885.88 --> 887.32]  are fervently waiting.
[888.56 --> 889.62]  They can identify
[889.62 --> 891.56]  with Simeon and Zachariah
[891.56 --> 892.62]  and Anna and Mary.
[892.70 --> 893.38]  Are we waiting?
[894.50 --> 895.36]  Because I think
[895.36 --> 896.42]  if I'm looking around
[896.42 --> 898.42]  honestly and self-assessing,
[898.88 --> 900.10]  not only am I shaped
[900.10 --> 901.74]  by my instant gratification culture,
[901.74 --> 904.22]  I'm shaped by my culture's story,
[904.40 --> 906.40]  which is not waiting.
[907.52 --> 908.36]  I think the reality
[908.36 --> 909.20]  for many of us
[909.20 --> 910.78]  in our society
[910.78 --> 912.22]  is that there's not
[912.22 --> 912.96]  hope for the future.
[913.06 --> 913.24]  In fact,
[913.28 --> 913.70]  there's quite a bit
[913.70 --> 914.50]  of fear for the future,
[914.62 --> 915.50]  and as a result,
[915.62 --> 916.14]  we live in what
[916.14 --> 916.98]  one writer calls
[916.98 --> 918.18]  the imminent frame,
[918.52 --> 919.34]  the here and now.
[919.76 --> 920.70]  What we look forward to
[920.70 --> 922.20]  is the next Amazon package,
[922.58 --> 923.56]  the next fancy meal
[923.56 --> 924.24]  out with friends,
[924.64 --> 926.48]  the next upgraded gaming system,
[926.60 --> 927.84]  the next upgraded phone.
[928.02 --> 929.18]  I'm told that new iPhone
[929.18 --> 929.94]  is so good
[929.94 --> 931.46]  that you'll need another one
[931.46 --> 932.00]  next Christmas.
[933.42 --> 934.34]  I mean, we joke,
[934.44 --> 935.96]  but I can't promise this,
[936.02 --> 937.02]  but probably next Christmas
[937.02 --> 937.64]  there's going to be
[937.64 --> 938.20]  a new iPhone
[938.20 --> 938.80]  that's going to tell you
[938.80 --> 940.54]  how much your old iPhone sucks,
[940.72 --> 941.80]  and you need a new one
[941.80 --> 943.28]  because that's how good life is,
[943.34 --> 944.64]  and we need to find meaning
[944.64 --> 946.44]  in the imminent moment
[946.44 --> 947.84]  with our technology,
[948.16 --> 949.18]  with all our gadgets
[949.18 --> 950.42]  to distract us
[950.42 --> 951.64]  from our fear
[951.64 --> 952.42]  and hopelessness
[952.42 --> 953.00]  for the future.
[954.52 --> 955.52]  And if any of this
[955.52 --> 957.08]  is ringing true for you,
[957.48 --> 958.36]  I want to invite you
[958.36 --> 958.90]  into the question
[958.90 --> 960.14]  I've been asking all week.
[960.86 --> 962.24]  If we live in an instant
[962.24 --> 963.36]  gratification culture,
[963.86 --> 966.08]  if we live in a cultural story
[966.08 --> 968.04]  that is not waiting
[968.04 --> 969.54]  for hope in the future,
[970.14 --> 971.54]  how do we as Christians
[971.54 --> 973.96]  cultivate and live in
[973.96 --> 975.82]  and fervently hold on
[975.82 --> 976.34]  our hope
[976.34 --> 978.10]  that Jesus is coming again
[978.10 --> 979.08]  to restore his world?
[979.54 --> 980.24]  How do we do that?
[980.68 --> 981.28]  That's the question
[981.28 --> 982.30]  I've been asking myself
[982.30 --> 983.26]  and as I wrestle
[983.26 --> 984.18]  with this passage.
[984.18 --> 985.84]  because if it's true
[985.84 --> 987.06]  that we live in the biblical story,
[987.12 --> 988.04]  that's the true story,
[988.48 --> 989.22]  we need to name
[989.22 --> 990.32]  that the end of the story
[990.32 --> 991.72]  is not Christmas.
[992.98 --> 993.98]  Some people come to church
[993.98 --> 994.76]  only on Christmas,
[995.10 --> 996.06]  and I almost want to say to them,
[996.10 --> 996.62]  just so you know,
[996.94 --> 998.52]  this is not the end of the story.
[998.88 --> 999.66]  The Christian story
[999.66 --> 1000.78]  does not end with a cradle.
[1000.94 --> 1001.84]  It doesn't even end
[1001.84 --> 1002.76]  with the cross.
[1003.64 --> 1004.92]  The story of the Bible
[1004.92 --> 1007.38]  finishes with cosmic renewal
[1007.38 --> 1009.14]  with Jesus Christ
[1009.14 --> 1010.26]  returning as a king,
[1010.58 --> 1011.58]  healing his creation,
[1011.94 --> 1013.00]  bringing back to life
[1013.00 --> 1014.12]  those who died in him
[1014.12 --> 1015.08]  and believe in him
[1015.08 --> 1015.60]  so they can have
[1015.60 --> 1016.50]  resurrected bodies
[1016.50 --> 1017.80]  in a resurrected world
[1017.80 --> 1019.40]  for the end forever.
[1020.46 --> 1021.72]  That's the Christian story.
[1022.46 --> 1024.06]  And my desire as a pastor
[1024.06 --> 1025.70]  is cultivating hope
[1025.70 --> 1027.30]  for the king to come
[1027.30 --> 1028.64]  in renewal and power
[1028.64 --> 1030.36]  for our world
[1030.36 --> 1031.50]  and for us.
[1033.24 --> 1034.64]  And it seems to me
[1034.64 --> 1036.50]  that cultivating hope
[1036.50 --> 1038.36]  and living with patient waiting
[1038.36 --> 1040.84]  requires a certain set of practices.
[1042.04 --> 1042.52]  Interestingly,
[1042.52 --> 1043.80]  I see a lot of them
[1043.80 --> 1045.24]  present in Luke chapter 2.
[1045.40 --> 1046.38]  This is sort of hidden
[1046.38 --> 1047.20]  in plain sight,
[1047.58 --> 1048.72]  but let me just point out
[1048.72 --> 1049.52]  something that's happening
[1049.52 --> 1050.44]  a lot in Luke 2.
[1050.56 --> 1051.44]  A lot of things
[1051.44 --> 1052.04]  that are happening
[1052.04 --> 1053.84]  happen in the temple.
[1054.68 --> 1055.24]  Did you notice that?
[1055.32 --> 1056.42]  Simeon moved in the temple.
[1056.74 --> 1058.32]  Zachariah brings his family
[1058.32 --> 1058.84]  to the temple.
[1059.20 --> 1059.94]  Guess what happens
[1059.94 --> 1060.46]  in a temple?
[1061.86 --> 1062.18]  Worship.
[1063.78 --> 1064.18]  Singing.
[1065.82 --> 1066.26]  Prayer.
[1067.14 --> 1069.30]  The reading of God's word.
[1069.30 --> 1070.94]  And I bet,
[1071.04 --> 1071.26]  I mean,
[1071.32 --> 1072.28]  I can't prove this,
[1072.58 --> 1073.26]  but I think people
[1073.26 --> 1074.74]  like Mary and Zachariah
[1074.74 --> 1075.32]  and Simeon,
[1075.46 --> 1076.84]  they regularly gathered
[1076.84 --> 1077.46]  in the temple,
[1077.58 --> 1078.58]  they regularly heard
[1078.58 --> 1079.38]  the scriptures read,
[1079.58 --> 1080.36]  they would regularly
[1080.36 --> 1081.82]  sing their faith
[1081.82 --> 1082.64]  in such a way
[1082.64 --> 1083.18]  that it gave them
[1083.18 --> 1084.22]  a clear vision
[1084.22 --> 1085.38]  for who they were,
[1085.88 --> 1086.80]  why they existed,
[1087.08 --> 1088.20]  and what they're hoping for.
[1088.74 --> 1090.04]  I think it was the life
[1090.04 --> 1090.96]  of the Christian community
[1090.96 --> 1092.64]  that held their hope
[1092.64 --> 1094.12]  as they gathered together
[1094.12 --> 1095.54]  and held on
[1095.54 --> 1096.52]  to what they truly believed
[1096.52 --> 1097.34]  was coming with Jesus.
[1099.24 --> 1100.28]  And I think
[1100.28 --> 1102.24]  you and I have experienced
[1102.24 --> 1103.38]  that in some way
[1103.38 --> 1104.56]  even as we gather
[1104.56 --> 1104.98]  for worship
[1104.98 --> 1105.80]  on a Sunday morning.
[1106.50 --> 1107.88]  For so many of us,
[1108.18 --> 1108.96]  as we go through
[1108.96 --> 1109.72]  the daily grind
[1109.72 --> 1110.44]  of Western life
[1110.44 --> 1111.40]  from Monday to Saturday,
[1111.64 --> 1113.06]  it's a full life, right?
[1113.34 --> 1114.32]  A full-time job
[1114.32 --> 1115.34]  with all sorts of demands
[1115.34 --> 1115.78]  at work,
[1115.90 --> 1116.78]  a lot of things
[1116.78 --> 1117.48]  on your plate.
[1117.66 --> 1118.68]  Then you've got family
[1118.68 --> 1119.56]  and extended family,
[1119.74 --> 1120.52]  friends and neighbors,
[1120.64 --> 1122.02]  all the stuff of life,
[1122.06 --> 1123.26]  and it's a full rotation.
[1123.26 --> 1124.54]  You get to Saturday night
[1124.54 --> 1125.76]  and you're exhausted.
[1126.96 --> 1128.56]  But then you have this habit.
[1129.04 --> 1129.60]  Maybe your parents
[1129.60 --> 1130.24]  force you to.
[1130.66 --> 1131.46]  Maybe you've just got
[1131.46 --> 1132.10]  a muscle memory.
[1132.20 --> 1133.24]  You get up on Sunday morning
[1133.24 --> 1133.60]  and you say,
[1133.66 --> 1133.90]  you know what,
[1133.90 --> 1134.78]  we're going to go to church.
[1135.70 --> 1136.30]  And then all of a sudden
[1136.30 --> 1137.02]  you start singing
[1137.02 --> 1138.74]  and you hear these strings playing
[1138.74 --> 1139.94]  and you start realizing,
[1140.14 --> 1140.36]  right,
[1140.76 --> 1142.04]  this is what's true
[1142.04 --> 1142.78]  about the world.
[1143.50 --> 1144.44]  This is what's true
[1144.44 --> 1144.98]  about Jesus,
[1145.12 --> 1145.68]  about me,
[1145.80 --> 1146.48]  about my life,
[1146.56 --> 1147.46]  about the future
[1147.46 --> 1148.28]  because of what Jesus
[1148.28 --> 1148.86]  has accomplished.
[1149.10 --> 1150.28]  And you sing your way
[1150.28 --> 1150.94]  into remembering
[1150.94 --> 1151.84]  who you are,
[1151.84 --> 1153.40]  whose we are,
[1153.56 --> 1154.40]  and what is true
[1154.40 --> 1155.44]  for the world.
[1156.54 --> 1157.04]  Let me give you
[1157.04 --> 1158.14]  a really concrete example
[1158.14 --> 1158.48]  of that.
[1159.22 --> 1159.92]  This Tuesday,
[1160.24 --> 1161.12]  we had a grief service
[1161.12 --> 1162.16]  in the fireside room.
[1162.48 --> 1163.16]  And Sandy Volkanet,
[1163.18 --> 1163.78]  I don't know if you're here,
[1163.90 --> 1165.06]  but what a beautiful service
[1165.06 --> 1165.52]  that was.
[1165.78 --> 1166.84]  What a privilege it was
[1166.84 --> 1167.58]  for me as a pastor
[1167.58 --> 1168.26]  to sit with people
[1168.26 --> 1168.80]  in our community
[1168.80 --> 1170.00]  and our church family
[1170.00 --> 1171.00]  who are carrying
[1171.00 --> 1172.34]  very heavy things.
[1172.92 --> 1173.26]  Death,
[1174.16 --> 1174.46]  sickness,
[1175.40 --> 1176.28]  friends who are going
[1176.28 --> 1176.90]  through crises,
[1177.10 --> 1178.08]  families that are divided
[1178.08 --> 1179.00]  for whatever reason.
[1179.00 --> 1180.18]  And we bring that
[1180.18 --> 1180.82]  before Jesus,
[1181.00 --> 1181.80]  before the Father,
[1182.24 --> 1182.84]  in lament,
[1183.92 --> 1184.82]  in silence.
[1185.46 --> 1186.56]  We pray together.
[1187.00 --> 1188.28]  We sang a couple songs
[1188.28 --> 1188.66]  together.
[1188.82 --> 1189.52]  And amazingly,
[1189.74 --> 1190.52]  we just found ourselves
[1190.52 --> 1192.40]  being grounded in Christ
[1192.40 --> 1193.44]  as this service went on.
[1193.46 --> 1194.72]  A very simple service.
[1195.48 --> 1196.58]  And a number of things
[1196.58 --> 1197.58]  were going through my mind
[1197.58 --> 1198.22]  in that service,
[1198.32 --> 1198.98]  especially because I was
[1198.98 --> 1199.86]  working on this passage.
[1200.40 --> 1201.06]  But here's something
[1201.06 --> 1202.06]  that hit me really deeply.
[1203.08 --> 1204.38]  People who suffer
[1204.38 --> 1206.00]  are the people
[1206.00 --> 1206.82]  who learn how to wait.
[1206.82 --> 1208.82]  Because what happens?
[1208.88 --> 1209.78]  You've got a person
[1209.78 --> 1210.90]  who lost their loved one,
[1210.98 --> 1211.84]  someone that they're married
[1211.84 --> 1212.92]  to for years upon years,
[1213.08 --> 1214.34]  and their heart aches
[1214.34 --> 1215.64]  to see that person again.
[1216.04 --> 1216.92]  And deep in them,
[1216.96 --> 1217.58]  if they're a believer,
[1217.88 --> 1219.48]  they want to see the day
[1219.48 --> 1220.34]  where Christ returns
[1220.34 --> 1221.10]  and they can see
[1221.10 --> 1221.86]  their spouse again
[1221.86 --> 1223.38]  in a new body,
[1223.64 --> 1224.48]  in a new world.
[1225.16 --> 1226.20]  Or perhaps someone
[1226.20 --> 1226.74]  who's there
[1226.74 --> 1227.62]  at the grief service,
[1227.72 --> 1228.98]  their body is breaking down,
[1229.06 --> 1229.92]  they're facing sickness
[1229.92 --> 1230.46]  and cancer,
[1230.74 --> 1231.92]  they are just so heavy
[1231.92 --> 1232.96]  with the frustration
[1232.96 --> 1233.56]  of a body
[1233.56 --> 1234.32]  that's breaking down,
[1234.32 --> 1237.08]  they ache for their own body
[1237.08 --> 1238.58]  to be healed and renewed.
[1238.72 --> 1239.32]  They're waiting
[1239.32 --> 1240.22]  for something to happen.
[1241.02 --> 1241.86]  Or families
[1241.86 --> 1242.94]  that have been broken up
[1242.94 --> 1243.80]  by all the conflict
[1243.80 --> 1245.14]  of COVID and other stuff.
[1245.54 --> 1246.42]  All they want
[1246.42 --> 1247.04]  is to be back
[1247.04 --> 1247.84]  the way they were
[1247.84 --> 1248.70]  and there's this ache
[1248.70 --> 1249.40]  in their hearts
[1249.40 --> 1250.90]  for God to somehow
[1250.90 --> 1251.96]  bring this family
[1251.96 --> 1252.70]  back together
[1252.70 --> 1253.46]  in healing
[1253.46 --> 1254.18]  and reconciliation.
[1255.50 --> 1256.56]  I think the suffering
[1256.56 --> 1257.48]  we walk through
[1257.48 --> 1258.80]  creates in us
[1258.80 --> 1260.14]  or it can create in us
[1260.14 --> 1262.32]  a hope for the future.
[1262.32 --> 1264.44]  we wait for something,
[1264.64 --> 1265.48]  some savior
[1265.48 --> 1267.04]  to bring healing
[1267.04 --> 1267.52]  and wholeness
[1267.52 --> 1268.60]  to our broken lives.
[1269.92 --> 1270.84]  One of my favorite things
[1270.84 --> 1271.56]  about the grief service
[1271.56 --> 1272.10]  is we finish
[1272.10 --> 1273.30]  by lighting a Christ candle.
[1273.74 --> 1274.70]  And I so appreciate that.
[1274.78 --> 1275.76]  We named our grief,
[1276.38 --> 1277.84]  we lit the candles
[1277.84 --> 1278.62]  to remind ourselves
[1278.62 --> 1279.54]  of loved ones we lost
[1279.54 --> 1280.38]  and we finish the service
[1280.38 --> 1281.40]  by lighting a Christ candle
[1281.40 --> 1282.86]  saying this person,
[1283.04 --> 1283.64]  Jesus Christ,
[1283.80 --> 1284.90]  is the light of the world.
[1285.46 --> 1286.38]  And that light of the world
[1286.38 --> 1286.84]  is coming
[1286.84 --> 1287.50]  and he's going to
[1287.50 --> 1288.52]  push back the darkness,
[1288.94 --> 1289.80]  wipe the tears away
[1289.80 --> 1290.46]  from our eyes
[1290.46 --> 1291.96]  and bring restoration.
[1293.02 --> 1293.66]  And I can tell you,
[1293.70 --> 1294.62]  I left that grief service
[1294.62 --> 1295.54]  just like everybody else
[1295.54 --> 1295.92]  who came,
[1296.38 --> 1297.64]  in a different place
[1297.64 --> 1299.04]  because I had hope
[1299.04 --> 1299.74]  that Jesus,
[1299.90 --> 1300.62]  the light of the world,
[1300.82 --> 1301.74]  is coming again.
[1305.42 --> 1306.50]  Now it needs to be named,
[1306.56 --> 1307.60]  and this is my final point
[1307.60 --> 1308.82]  before we wrap this sermon up,
[1309.30 --> 1310.58]  that waiting is not passive.
[1311.04 --> 1311.88]  I think when you and I
[1311.88 --> 1313.06]  think about that word waiting,
[1313.94 --> 1315.00]  we think just kind of
[1315.00 --> 1315.76]  twiddling your thumbs,
[1315.92 --> 1316.68]  hoping that something's
[1316.68 --> 1317.20]  going to happen.
[1317.20 --> 1318.90]  But I think biblically speaking
[1318.90 --> 1319.96]  and for Christians,
[1320.10 --> 1320.44]  waiting,
[1320.80 --> 1322.58]  it moves you into action.
[1323.62 --> 1325.32]  Waiting with some future hope
[1325.32 --> 1326.32]  shapes the way you live
[1326.32 --> 1327.44]  your ordinary present.
[1328.08 --> 1328.88]  And generally speaking,
[1328.96 --> 1329.26]  by the way,
[1329.28 --> 1330.76]  if you look at how someone
[1330.76 --> 1331.44]  lives their life,
[1331.64 --> 1332.42]  you can find out
[1332.42 --> 1333.30]  by how they live
[1333.30 --> 1334.08]  what their hope is
[1334.08 --> 1335.42]  or if they have hope.
[1336.40 --> 1337.26]  There's a woman
[1337.26 --> 1338.50]  by the name of Deb Reinstra,
[1339.30 --> 1341.64]  a professor at Calum University,
[1342.46 --> 1343.32]  and she writes this
[1343.32 --> 1344.54]  about our ordinary lives,
[1344.64 --> 1345.98]  our ordinary work in the world,
[1345.98 --> 1347.82]  as an act of waiting patiently.
[1348.22 --> 1349.12]  This is what she writes.
[1350.10 --> 1351.24]  Can it be possible
[1351.24 --> 1353.38]  that being faithful to our Lord
[1353.38 --> 1355.10]  in everyday routines
[1355.10 --> 1358.26]  demonstrates holy watchfulness
[1358.26 --> 1359.20]  for his return?
[1360.10 --> 1363.56]  Is being an honest office manager,
[1364.32 --> 1365.96]  a careful school bus driver,
[1366.46 --> 1367.78]  an ethical attorney,
[1368.26 --> 1369.42]  a thoughtful housewife
[1369.42 --> 1369.94]  or a husband,
[1370.28 --> 1372.32]  really a sign that we are aware
[1372.32 --> 1373.72]  that Jesus is coming back?
[1373.72 --> 1376.86]  Yes, it is.
[1377.62 --> 1378.54]  That is to say,
[1378.62 --> 1379.70]  as we seek to live
[1379.70 --> 1380.54]  in the light of Jesus,
[1380.64 --> 1381.84]  as we seek to follow him
[1381.84 --> 1382.76]  in our ordinary routines,
[1383.00 --> 1384.62]  we reveal something
[1384.62 --> 1385.60]  of what's coming
[1385.60 --> 1386.94]  when Jesus returns in glory.
[1387.22 --> 1388.36]  We reflect something
[1388.36 --> 1389.36]  of the light of Jesus
[1389.36 --> 1390.40]  that will fill the earth
[1390.40 --> 1391.42]  when he returns.
[1395.06 --> 1396.60]  In Ann Tyler's novel,
[1397.88 --> 1399.10]  Lindy, the runaway daughter,
[1399.22 --> 1400.66]  finally does come home,
[1400.84 --> 1402.00]  years and years,
[1402.00 --> 1403.10]  after she runs away.
[1403.96 --> 1405.06]  And sadly, Pauline,
[1405.14 --> 1405.48]  her mother,
[1405.52 --> 1406.86]  does not live to see the day.
[1407.42 --> 1407.98]  But Michael,
[1408.28 --> 1408.84]  her father,
[1408.92 --> 1409.38]  is home
[1409.38 --> 1411.26]  and is delighted
[1411.26 --> 1412.50]  by the return of his daughter.
[1413.22 --> 1414.18]  And in a conversation
[1414.18 --> 1415.50]  about the mother
[1415.50 --> 1416.16]  who passed away,
[1416.24 --> 1416.88]  this is what Michael
[1416.88 --> 1417.80]  says to Lindy.
[1418.66 --> 1419.70]  You need to know
[1419.70 --> 1420.58]  that your mother
[1420.58 --> 1422.12]  never gave up hope.
[1422.38 --> 1423.32]  I could tell.
[1424.36 --> 1425.18]  Oh, of course,
[1425.28 --> 1426.34]  Pauline had gotten on
[1426.34 --> 1426.80]  with life,
[1426.90 --> 1427.98]  but she just had a way
[1427.98 --> 1429.50]  of glancing out the window
[1429.50 --> 1430.92]  to let you know
[1430.92 --> 1432.98]  that hope was still there.
[1433.72 --> 1434.42]  Your mother
[1434.42 --> 1435.88]  never gave up.
[1436.46 --> 1437.52]  I could tell.
[1439.28 --> 1440.04]  Now, a prayer
[1440.04 --> 1441.04]  that grew within me
[1441.04 --> 1442.04]  as I was working
[1442.04 --> 1442.88]  on this passage,
[1443.30 --> 1444.34]  preparing for this sermon,
[1444.72 --> 1445.62]  was that when Jesus
[1445.62 --> 1447.06]  returns in glory
[1447.06 --> 1447.72]  and power,
[1448.52 --> 1449.18]  as the king
[1449.18 --> 1450.40]  who already rules
[1450.40 --> 1451.32]  over his creation,
[1451.84 --> 1452.50]  he would be received
[1453.14 --> 1454.74]  by this church
[1454.74 --> 1455.88]  that is watching
[1455.88 --> 1456.56]  and waiting.
[1456.56 --> 1458.96]  that he'd be received
[1458.96 --> 1459.46]  by people
[1459.46 --> 1460.62]  who are so eager
[1460.62 --> 1461.30]  for his return
[1461.30 --> 1462.20]  that we bubble up
[1462.20 --> 1463.62]  like Simeon with praise
[1463.62 --> 1465.30]  because we've been waiting
[1465.30 --> 1467.12]  and our eyes now behold
[1467.12 --> 1468.02]  the one who wipes
[1468.02 --> 1468.80]  our tears away,
[1469.26 --> 1470.44]  who heals our creation
[1470.44 --> 1472.72]  and fixes all the brokenness
[1472.72 --> 1473.54]  of this world.
[1475.00 --> 1475.76]  And imagine,
[1476.26 --> 1477.26]  it could be said
[1477.26 --> 1477.92]  by our neighbors
[1477.92 --> 1478.72]  and friends,
[1478.90 --> 1479.46]  our coworkers
[1479.46 --> 1480.14]  and classmates
[1480.14 --> 1480.82]  who struggle
[1480.82 --> 1481.66]  to live with hope,
[1482.24 --> 1482.84]  who have fear
[1482.84 --> 1483.48]  about the future
[1483.48 --> 1484.56]  and struggle to make meaning
[1484.56 --> 1485.50]  of their ordinary life,
[1485.50 --> 1486.94]  imagine it would be said
[1486.94 --> 1488.12]  of them about the church.
[1488.42 --> 1489.42]  You know those Christians,
[1490.18 --> 1492.18]  they never gave up hope.
[1492.98 --> 1494.26]  As we looked at their lives,
[1494.34 --> 1496.28]  we could just tell.
[1498.56 --> 1499.42]  Let's pray together.
[1505.68 --> 1506.64]  Father, we thank you
[1506.64 --> 1507.30]  for the promise
[1507.30 --> 1508.34]  that your son
[1508.34 --> 1509.08]  is coming back.
[1510.70 --> 1511.78]  And we ask that you
[1511.78 --> 1512.98]  would give us hope,
[1512.98 --> 1515.36]  that you by your spirit
[1515.36 --> 1516.46]  would give us the strength
[1516.46 --> 1517.28]  to resist
[1517.28 --> 1519.54]  our instant gratification,
[1519.76 --> 1520.60]  hopeless culture
[1520.60 --> 1522.62]  and fill us
[1522.62 --> 1523.74]  with the perseverance,
[1524.60 --> 1526.58]  the ability
[1526.58 --> 1527.80]  to wait patiently.
[1529.42 --> 1530.12]  And Lord,
[1530.18 --> 1531.84]  we join your global church,
[1532.66 --> 1534.16]  the persecuted church,
[1534.76 --> 1535.58]  the church
[1535.58 --> 1537.26]  that is at threat
[1537.26 --> 1537.94]  of governments.
[1538.10 --> 1539.06]  We join them in saying,
[1539.22 --> 1539.92]  come soon,
[1540.04 --> 1540.58]  Lord Jesus,
[1540.58 --> 1542.56]  and heal your world.
[1543.38 --> 1544.52]  We pray this in the moment.
