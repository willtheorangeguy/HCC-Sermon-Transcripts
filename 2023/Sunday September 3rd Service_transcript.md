[0.00 --> 0.86]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[3.06 --> 4.66]  It is good to be together.
[4.98 --> 6.68]  The first day of our September worship.
[7.66 --> 9.36]  And if you've been around for the last couple weeks,
[9.40 --> 12.32]  you'll know that we're working our way through a series called Your Story.
[13.28 --> 15.42]  And in this series, we've been working out, first of all,
[15.50 --> 17.70]  what the gospel is, the death and resurrection of Jesus,
[18.00 --> 21.50]  and how that only makes sense within the unfolding story of the Bible,
[21.54 --> 24.14]  which is unified and the mighty acts of God.
[24.76 --> 27.24]  And we're making the argument that the Bible is the only story
[27.24 --> 30.90]  that makes sense of human life and how we are to live it.
[31.68 --> 33.60]  And this morning, we're going to open up the way in which
[33.60 --> 36.10]  there's a whole different story in our society
[36.10 --> 39.12]  that is claiming allegiance of your heart, your mind, your ambitions,
[39.36 --> 40.38]  your work, and your family.
[40.88 --> 43.02]  And that is the story of our Western society.
[43.82 --> 45.32]  And so I'm going to share that story,
[45.56 --> 47.60]  and we're going to show how the Bible invites us
[47.60 --> 50.70]  to make a break of repentance and faith into the biblical story.
[50.84 --> 52.96]  And so if you have your Bible, turn with me to the passage
[52.96 --> 56.34]  that you have already heard, Romans 12, 1 and 2.
[57.24 --> 62.92]  Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters,
[63.08 --> 68.00]  in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice,
[68.64 --> 70.18]  holy and pleasing to God.
[70.80 --> 71.94]  This is true worship.
[72.96 --> 76.78]  Do not conform to the patterns of this world,
[77.22 --> 80.12]  but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[80.62 --> 83.62]  Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is,
[83.62 --> 86.72]  his good, perfect, and pleasing will.
[87.24 --> 94.00]  Well, it is Labor Day, and I thought I would start with an illustration about work.
[95.80 --> 98.74]  Laura was excited to go into the meeting.
[99.44 --> 104.18]  She had just landed a job as an engineer in a global manufacturing industry,
[104.50 --> 106.34]  and she was going in to sign the contract
[106.34 --> 108.86]  and meet with a senior manager about this position
[108.86 --> 110.84]  and the details that she was about to start.
[110.84 --> 111.76]  Look at this.
[111.84 --> 114.30]  I have a young boy coming up to the stage here.
[114.52 --> 115.12]  This is great.
[115.42 --> 116.18]  No worries, Hope.
[116.26 --> 117.38]  This just delights my heart.
[117.80 --> 119.44]  Most people run the other way, you know.
[122.36 --> 123.12]  There we go.
[126.54 --> 128.42]  Laura sat down with her senior manager,
[128.60 --> 130.32]  and he wanted to introduce her to the job,
[130.44 --> 132.02]  thank her for applying and getting it,
[132.02 --> 134.90]  and he said, I want to give you a vision for this position
[134.90 --> 136.46]  as you go in this company.
[136.92 --> 138.20]  And this is what he said to her.
[139.04 --> 141.44]  As you begin as an engineer in this company,
[141.66 --> 143.30]  you're going to be doing a lot of hard work,
[143.36 --> 144.78]  some of the more annoying work
[144.78 --> 146.54]  and dealing with people on the shop floor.
[147.00 --> 148.30]  The pay will be okay.
[149.48 --> 150.46]  In five years' time,
[150.52 --> 152.18]  you won't have to deal with those people anymore.
[152.36 --> 153.70]  You'll mostly deal with management.
[154.46 --> 155.56]  You'll move up in the ranks,
[155.56 --> 157.24]  and the work will get easier.
[158.18 --> 159.14]  After about 10 years,
[159.20 --> 160.72]  you'll get a big pay hike,
[161.12 --> 161.90]  stock options,
[162.04 --> 163.52]  and a lot more freedom.
[164.12 --> 164.90]  And this is how we finished.
[164.98 --> 166.78]  If you play your cards right,
[167.16 --> 169.16]  you should be able to retire young
[169.16 --> 170.88]  and have a great pension
[170.88 --> 172.76]  to do whatever you want
[172.76 --> 173.92]  with your retirement.
[176.72 --> 179.50]  Now, when that senior manager sat down with Laura,
[180.08 --> 182.22]  he did not just offer her a job, did he?
[183.42 --> 185.28]  He gave her a vision
[185.28 --> 187.42]  for why she should do that job,
[187.48 --> 189.54]  a vision for what made all those years
[189.54 --> 191.76]  as an engineer in this industry
[191.76 --> 193.80]  that would give it meaning.
[195.12 --> 196.60]  And, you know, the story starts
[196.60 --> 197.78]  with her doing hard work,
[198.06 --> 199.16]  dealing with difficult people,
[199.28 --> 200.80]  not enjoying it, decent pay,
[200.90 --> 202.44]  and then it moved to sort of better work,
[202.54 --> 203.40]  more enjoyable pay,
[203.46 --> 204.14]  a little more freedom,
[204.34 --> 207.18]  and it finished with a nice, fat pension,
[207.88 --> 209.16]  freedom to enjoy
[209.16 --> 211.12]  and finally do whatever she wanted to do.
[212.16 --> 214.40]  And whether the manager knew it or not,
[214.40 --> 216.28]  he was giving Laura a version,
[216.46 --> 217.38]  as we're going to see today,
[217.50 --> 218.82]  of the Western story,
[219.56 --> 222.42]  of our society's vision of the good life,
[222.96 --> 224.22]  material prosperity,
[224.60 --> 228.54]  the freedom to do whatever you want.
[228.54 --> 231.50]  Now, we said at the beginning of the series
[231.50 --> 233.44]  that every single person
[233.44 --> 235.62]  lives out of some story.
[235.76 --> 237.42]  Every culture operates
[237.42 --> 238.72]  out of some bigger vision
[238.72 --> 239.60]  of what humans are for,
[239.68 --> 240.48]  what the world's about,
[240.64 --> 242.24]  how we're supposed to live our lives.
[242.40 --> 243.66]  There is not a single person
[243.66 --> 246.20]  who doesn't live out of a story.
[246.94 --> 247.82]  And the goal, I think,
[247.84 --> 248.34]  is for everyone,
[248.48 --> 249.82]  know what your story is.
[250.20 --> 251.86]  There is a reason we get out of bed,
[251.92 --> 253.26]  there's a reason we'd go to school,
[253.36 --> 254.54]  there's a reason we'd go to work.
[254.68 --> 255.84]  Whether you're a workaholic
[255.84 --> 256.80]  or a weekend party
[256.80 --> 257.98]  or anything in between,
[258.26 --> 259.14]  there is a reason
[259.14 --> 260.12]  why you do what you do.
[260.20 --> 260.94]  You give yourself
[260.94 --> 262.00]  to the things that you do.
[262.26 --> 264.36]  There's some vision of a good life
[264.36 --> 265.82]  that's compelling you forward.
[266.46 --> 267.12]  That's a conviction
[267.12 --> 268.32]  about every human being.
[268.80 --> 270.10]  It's also true to say
[270.10 --> 271.70]  that every society
[271.70 --> 273.68]  operates out of a big vision
[273.68 --> 274.44]  of life as well.
[274.54 --> 275.58]  Some story
[275.58 --> 277.30]  about what humans are for.
[277.44 --> 279.16]  Some story about human purpose
[279.16 --> 279.84]  in this world.
[280.06 --> 281.42]  Every society is organized
[281.42 --> 282.52]  around that.
[283.24 --> 284.58]  And it's true of the West anyway,
[284.72 --> 285.80]  I don't know about other countries,
[285.90 --> 287.26]  but no one sits you down
[287.26 --> 287.74]  and says,
[287.86 --> 289.10]  hey, Dave Groon,
[289.16 --> 290.20]  you're growing up in Canada,
[290.60 --> 292.28]  this is what human beings are for,
[292.60 --> 293.98]  this is why you get a job,
[294.32 --> 296.08]  this is what the purpose of life is,
[296.16 --> 297.02]  this is where we've come from.
[297.04 --> 297.78]  No one does that.
[298.56 --> 298.90]  Instead,
[299.16 --> 299.92]  you are formed
[299.92 --> 301.20]  into a certain way of being
[301.20 --> 303.22]  through thousands of hours
[303.22 --> 304.08]  of immersion.
[305.08 --> 305.24]  You know,
[305.26 --> 305.88]  there's a few people here
[305.88 --> 306.28]  this morning
[306.28 --> 307.12]  who are new to Canada
[307.12 --> 307.92]  and they're getting a sense
[307.92 --> 309.24]  of this Canadian culture
[309.24 --> 310.02]  which is very different
[310.02 --> 310.90]  than where they grew up.
[310.90 --> 311.88]  But those of us
[311.88 --> 312.48]  who grow up
[312.48 --> 313.50]  in a Western society
[313.50 --> 314.10]  like Canada,
[314.22 --> 315.40]  there's just a way of being,
[315.88 --> 316.74]  a way of relating,
[316.88 --> 317.58]  a way of speaking,
[317.70 --> 318.50]  a way of thinking
[318.50 --> 320.32]  that is very much shaped
[320.32 --> 321.54]  by Western society,
[321.66 --> 322.62]  by thousands of hours
[322.62 --> 323.44]  in a classroom,
[323.90 --> 324.56]  in a workplace,
[325.22 --> 326.68]  taking in political discourse
[326.68 --> 327.58]  or what they think
[327.58 --> 328.18]  is meaningful,
[328.44 --> 329.56]  intelligent political discourse,
[330.04 --> 331.10]  taking in social media
[331.10 --> 331.70]  and Netflix,
[331.88 --> 333.06]  all of it reinforces
[333.06 --> 333.90]  some story,
[334.02 --> 334.46]  some vision
[334.46 --> 335.86]  of a good life.
[336.76 --> 337.66]  Let me give an example
[337.66 --> 338.84]  of how even architecture
[338.84 --> 339.96]  in a city
[339.96 --> 341.42]  tells a story.
[342.12 --> 343.68]  In the medieval era,
[344.22 --> 344.84]  if you went to
[344.84 --> 346.38]  any Western area,
[346.56 --> 347.82]  any Western community,
[347.96 --> 348.78]  the tallest building
[348.78 --> 349.36]  in that community
[349.36 --> 349.94]  would be
[349.94 --> 351.54]  the church.
[352.14 --> 352.56]  Today,
[352.72 --> 354.06]  in almost every Western city,
[354.14 --> 355.14]  what's the tallest building?
[356.24 --> 357.14]  The banks.
[357.54 --> 358.70]  There was a story there,
[358.78 --> 359.00]  right?
[359.32 --> 360.40]  This wasn't accidental.
[360.94 --> 361.86]  It was a vision
[361.86 --> 362.86]  of the good life
[362.86 --> 363.38]  that shifted
[363.38 --> 364.20]  from one thing
[364.20 --> 364.86]  to another
[364.86 --> 365.62]  and the one thing
[365.62 --> 366.42]  that has prominence
[366.42 --> 367.32]  in Western societies
[367.32 --> 368.52]  is money.
[369.10 --> 370.22]  There's a story there.
[371.38 --> 372.28]  And I want to now,
[372.40 --> 372.98]  audaciously,
[373.12 --> 374.00]  and I do feel like
[374.00 --> 374.84]  this is a bold thing
[374.84 --> 375.22]  to try,
[375.32 --> 376.64]  I want to try to tell us
[376.64 --> 377.52]  the story of our
[377.52 --> 378.34]  Western society
[378.34 --> 379.50]  as succinctly as possible.
[379.88 --> 380.76]  If you happen to be
[380.76 --> 381.60]  a history professor
[381.60 --> 382.72]  who stumbled into
[382.72 --> 383.64]  our church this morning,
[383.92 --> 385.14]  I just want to say sorry.
[385.70 --> 386.80]  I'm going to skip over
[386.80 --> 387.58]  a lot of detail.
[388.10 --> 389.32]  I've decided in advance
[389.32 --> 390.12]  that it's for the better
[390.12 --> 391.74]  and I know that I'm missing
[391.74 --> 392.90]  a lot of important stuff.
[393.10 --> 393.86]  But this will give us
[393.86 --> 394.88]  what I think is the movement
[394.88 --> 396.16]  of the Western story.
[396.16 --> 398.20]  And I want to do it
[398.20 --> 398.76]  from the perspective
[398.76 --> 399.50]  of someone who lives
[399.50 --> 400.64]  within itself consciously.
[401.56 --> 401.94]  You ready?
[403.30 --> 405.04]  In the beginning
[405.04 --> 408.40]  is a chaotic world.
[409.36 --> 410.50]  And that chaotic world
[410.50 --> 411.46]  came into existence
[411.46 --> 412.70]  through a random series
[412.70 --> 413.94]  of inexplicable
[413.94 --> 415.28]  and unique events.
[416.22 --> 417.58]  It was a chaotic world
[417.58 --> 418.22]  in the beginning
[418.22 --> 419.40]  and the earliest people
[419.40 --> 420.46]  who lived in this world
[420.46 --> 421.70]  lived with high levels
[421.70 --> 422.74]  of superstition.
[422.74 --> 424.68]  They religiously prayed
[424.68 --> 426.20]  to gods of all kinds
[426.20 --> 427.04]  hoping that these
[427.04 --> 428.80]  mysterious divine beings
[428.80 --> 429.78]  would help their lives,
[430.14 --> 430.78]  give them health
[430.78 --> 431.34]  and strength
[431.34 --> 431.98]  and prosperity
[431.98 --> 433.28]  and get them along
[433.28 --> 434.08]  with their lives.
[434.94 --> 436.18]  They were ignorant.
[436.90 --> 437.86]  They didn't understand
[437.86 --> 438.90]  the way the world worked.
[439.02 --> 440.38]  They lived in superstition
[440.38 --> 441.52]  and we had to live
[441.52 --> 442.16]  with this ignorance
[442.16 --> 443.38]  for many, many years.
[444.20 --> 444.74]  There were glimpses
[445.30 --> 446.60]  of knowledge and insight
[446.60 --> 447.70]  as new philosophers
[447.70 --> 448.88]  would come into history,
[449.28 --> 450.34]  sort of begin to discern
[450.34 --> 451.18]  how the world worked.
[451.18 --> 452.32]  But generally speaking,
[452.46 --> 453.32]  for hundreds of years
[453.32 --> 454.42]  and thousands of years,
[454.84 --> 456.18]  religious superstitions
[456.18 --> 458.08]  suppressed truth,
[458.82 --> 460.48]  suppressed real knowledge
[460.48 --> 462.30]  of how the world worked.
[462.98 --> 464.54]  We even describe this era
[464.54 --> 466.46]  as the Dark Ages.
[467.76 --> 470.74]  But then something happened.
[471.74 --> 474.12]  Some good news finally came
[474.12 --> 475.14]  and we describe it
[475.14 --> 476.98]  as the Enlightenment,
[477.56 --> 479.20]  where light started breaking
[479.20 --> 480.58]  into Western society
[480.58 --> 482.56]  through educated philosophers,
[483.52 --> 485.80]  scientists, and economists
[485.80 --> 487.46]  who started to realize
[487.46 --> 490.12]  the power of the human brain.
[490.76 --> 492.20]  They started inventing
[492.20 --> 493.46]  all sorts of machines
[493.46 --> 494.90]  that made work easier,
[495.02 --> 496.24]  that made work more efficient,
[496.54 --> 497.60]  all sorts of technology
[497.60 --> 498.78]  that made human life
[498.78 --> 499.98]  more enjoyable.
[500.62 --> 501.96]  Scientists started discovering
[501.96 --> 503.24]  medicine and cures
[503.24 --> 503.90]  for diseases
[503.90 --> 505.10]  and prolonging
[505.10 --> 506.44]  and protecting life.
[506.44 --> 507.92]  all of a sudden
[507.92 --> 508.64]  it felt like
[508.64 --> 509.54]  we were building
[509.54 --> 511.28]  a better world.
[511.96 --> 513.12]  We were finally
[513.12 --> 515.04]  progressing together
[515.04 --> 516.76]  as we shed off
[516.76 --> 518.06]  the religious superstition,
[518.86 --> 520.40]  studied the material world
[520.40 --> 522.26]  with our very big brains,
[522.68 --> 523.92]  used the technology
[523.92 --> 525.10]  and science around us
[525.10 --> 527.38]  to build a better society.
[527.38 --> 531.18]  That, in my opinion,
[531.48 --> 532.82]  is the summarized version
[532.82 --> 533.88]  of the Western story.
[535.10 --> 536.62]  The getting rid of the religion
[536.62 --> 538.48]  and building a better world
[538.48 --> 539.38]  through what humans
[539.38 --> 540.24]  can do on their own,
[540.36 --> 541.06]  through their minds,
[541.18 --> 542.54]  through science and technology.
[542.86 --> 543.92]  And it's in a place
[543.92 --> 544.64]  like the West
[544.64 --> 546.42]  during the Industrial Revolution
[546.42 --> 547.26]  and the Enlightenment
[547.26 --> 548.94]  where we had these taglines
[548.94 --> 551.08]  like cogito ergo sum.
[551.18 --> 551.54]  Does anyone know
[551.54 --> 552.04]  what that means?
[552.04 --> 554.54]  I think,
[555.34 --> 556.48]  therefore I am.
[557.48 --> 558.04]  And by the way,
[558.10 --> 558.62]  that should always
[558.62 --> 559.34]  trouble Christians
[559.34 --> 560.44]  because it basically says
[560.44 --> 562.04]  if you're of a lower capacity
[562.04 --> 562.52]  in your mind,
[562.58 --> 563.44]  you're not fully human.
[564.56 --> 565.04]  What does it say
[565.04 --> 566.08]  to anyone with disabilities?
[566.20 --> 566.76]  I think,
[566.92 --> 567.40]  therefore I am.
[567.52 --> 568.58]  That's the Western way
[568.58 --> 568.90]  of thinking.
[569.18 --> 570.42]  What makes you significant
[570.42 --> 570.96]  is that you're
[570.96 --> 572.02]  a rational being
[572.02 --> 573.10]  who can develop
[573.10 --> 574.16]  science and technology
[574.16 --> 574.78]  that'll make us
[574.78 --> 575.48]  a better world.
[577.38 --> 578.50]  Now, there's no one
[578.50 --> 579.20]  who is engaged
[579.20 --> 581.04]  with this Western story
[581.04 --> 581.78]  more deeply
[581.78 --> 582.62]  and more critically
[582.62 --> 583.86]  than a famous
[583.86 --> 584.48]  atheist,
[584.78 --> 585.84]  nihilist philosopher
[585.84 --> 587.48]  named Friedrich Nietzsche.
[587.58 --> 588.18]  Maybe some of you
[588.18 --> 588.72]  have heard of him.
[589.34 --> 589.98]  He grew up
[589.98 --> 591.08]  after hundreds of years
[591.08 --> 592.58]  of this technological revolution,
[592.78 --> 593.70]  the Industrial Revolution,
[593.70 --> 594.64]  and saw the way
[594.64 --> 596.22]  it just totally shaped
[596.22 --> 597.90]  European Western society.
[598.04 --> 599.06]  And I want to read for you
[599.06 --> 600.10]  his take
[600.10 --> 601.58]  on what it has done
[601.58 --> 602.84]  and what has taken place.
[602.92 --> 603.52]  You ready for this?
[603.54 --> 604.82]  This is a very sobering quote.
[605.68 --> 606.24]  He writes,
[607.02 --> 608.76]  God is dead
[608.76 --> 612.00]  and we have killed him.
[612.96 --> 614.76]  How shall we comfort ourselves?
[614.90 --> 615.72]  The murderers
[615.72 --> 617.02]  of all murderers.
[617.24 --> 618.26]  Is not the greatness
[618.26 --> 618.98]  of this deed
[618.98 --> 620.12]  too great for us?
[620.18 --> 621.48]  And here's the chilling line.
[621.82 --> 622.86]  Must we ourselves
[622.86 --> 624.06]  not become gods
[624.06 --> 625.80]  simply to appear
[625.80 --> 627.18]  worthy of it?
[628.28 --> 629.38]  Just pause.
[629.82 --> 631.14]  I want to really highlight
[631.14 --> 632.96]  that core piece
[632.96 --> 634.02]  of the Western story
[634.02 --> 635.80]  is getting rid of religion
[635.80 --> 636.50]  altogether.
[636.50 --> 638.08]  There is no God.
[638.20 --> 639.56]  There is no anything above us.
[639.66 --> 640.24]  All we have
[640.24 --> 641.28]  is a material world
[641.28 --> 642.30]  and all we have
[642.30 --> 643.42]  is to do ruling it
[643.42 --> 644.00]  on our own.
[645.46 --> 646.70]  I need to add though,
[646.88 --> 647.82]  and this is a unique moment
[647.82 --> 648.32]  we live in.
[648.42 --> 649.80]  If you live in Canada
[649.80 --> 650.86]  or any Western society
[650.86 --> 651.30]  right now,
[651.38 --> 651.80]  we are living
[651.80 --> 652.74]  at a monumental
[652.74 --> 653.94]  shifting moment
[653.94 --> 656.32]  because this is the first time
[656.32 --> 657.18]  where many people
[657.18 --> 657.64]  are saying
[657.64 --> 658.84]  there's something wrong
[658.84 --> 659.98]  with this Western story.
[660.60 --> 661.46]  And they're saying that
[661.46 --> 662.80]  because we all now know
[662.80 --> 664.86]  that it's very bright minds
[664.86 --> 666.44]  like Oppenheimer
[666.44 --> 668.72]  who developed technology
[668.72 --> 669.48]  and science
[669.48 --> 670.18]  to make what?
[670.86 --> 672.24]  An atomic bomb
[672.24 --> 674.06]  that decimates civilization.
[674.88 --> 676.02]  And ever since that moment
[676.02 --> 676.56]  people thought,
[676.72 --> 677.94]  are we building a better world?
[678.08 --> 679.30]  Are we now destroying it
[679.30 --> 679.98]  more efficiently?
[680.94 --> 681.60]  And in the light
[681.60 --> 683.48]  of all the technological revolutions
[683.48 --> 684.80]  of the last number of years
[684.80 --> 685.42]  from phones
[685.42 --> 685.98]  and computers
[685.98 --> 686.76]  and Wi-Fi,
[687.12 --> 687.92]  now we see
[687.92 --> 688.84]  we're more anxious.
[689.60 --> 690.92]  The gap between the wealthy
[690.92 --> 691.50]  and the poor
[691.50 --> 692.26]  is not shrinking.
[692.26 --> 693.30]  We haven't solved
[693.30 --> 694.30]  environmental degradation.
[694.88 --> 695.98]  We haven't solved racism.
[696.38 --> 697.26]  All sorts of things
[697.26 --> 698.72]  that plague our good world.
[699.46 --> 699.94]  Technology
[699.94 --> 701.54]  and rational humans
[701.54 --> 702.12]  through science
[702.12 --> 703.48]  have not solved.
[704.20 --> 705.60]  And we have to ask the question,
[706.24 --> 707.72]  were humans ever made
[707.72 --> 708.82]  to be the saviors
[708.82 --> 709.52]  of the world?
[710.98 --> 712.06]  I happen to think
[712.06 --> 712.84]  that we live in a moment
[712.84 --> 714.04]  of such anxiety
[714.04 --> 714.80]  like in the West.
[714.88 --> 715.88]  There's a deep anxiety
[715.88 --> 716.94]  that just pervades
[716.94 --> 717.76]  our society.
[718.08 --> 719.18]  And the reason is
[719.18 --> 720.02]  is that in our story
[720.02 --> 721.14]  we've gotten rid of God.
[721.14 --> 722.60]  we now realize
[722.60 --> 723.42]  we've made a mess
[723.42 --> 724.34]  and we don't know
[724.34 --> 725.12]  where to go.
[726.16 --> 726.90]  We don't know
[726.90 --> 727.52]  what to do.
[727.80 --> 728.54]  Like it is a
[728.54 --> 730.32]  culture-wide challenge
[730.32 --> 731.72]  of like plummeting
[731.72 --> 732.44]  mental health,
[732.86 --> 734.16]  higher levels of anxiety,
[734.50 --> 735.56]  incredible levels
[735.56 --> 736.50]  of hopelessness
[736.50 --> 737.70]  and suicidality.
[738.02 --> 738.86]  That's what's happening
[738.86 --> 739.58]  in the West right now
[739.58 --> 740.14]  because we're like
[740.14 --> 741.52]  we're living in this story
[741.52 --> 742.44]  and it's failing us
[742.44 --> 743.14]  and we don't know
[743.14 --> 743.80]  what to do.
[745.22 --> 746.64]  A key feature though,
[746.74 --> 747.82]  even as we deconstruct
[747.82 --> 748.32]  this story,
[748.40 --> 748.96]  a key feature
[748.96 --> 749.82]  that's still baked
[749.82 --> 750.64]  into us
[750.64 --> 751.92]  and baked into
[751.92 --> 753.10]  our society structures
[753.10 --> 755.22]  is that the self
[755.22 --> 757.22]  is God.
[758.74 --> 760.10]  Nobody tells you
[760.10 --> 760.82]  what to do.
[761.48 --> 762.70]  Nobody can stuff down
[762.70 --> 763.68]  their religious morals
[763.68 --> 764.40]  down your throat.
[764.74 --> 765.50]  Nobody can tell you
[765.50 --> 766.60]  how to live your sex life,
[766.70 --> 767.76]  your financial life,
[767.82 --> 768.46]  your work life.
[768.70 --> 770.06]  You get to call the shots.
[770.14 --> 771.32]  Ain't nobody telling you
[771.32 --> 771.70]  what to do.
[771.78 --> 773.16]  That is just core
[773.16 --> 774.42]  in the Western story
[774.42 --> 775.40]  that's still baked
[775.40 --> 776.38]  into Netflix,
[776.92 --> 777.48]  the Super Bowl
[777.48 --> 778.40]  halftime show,
[778.74 --> 780.72]  grade six sex education,
[781.14 --> 782.22]  our HR policies.
[782.34 --> 783.56]  It's all about
[783.56 --> 785.02]  you as an individual
[785.02 --> 786.22]  being protected
[786.22 --> 788.60]  to do what you want to do.
[789.98 --> 791.98]  This is the Western story.
[792.64 --> 793.68]  And it seems to me
[793.68 --> 795.86]  a very simplified take on it
[795.86 --> 797.18]  is that the Western story
[797.18 --> 799.08]  is really recasting
[799.08 --> 800.32]  the Genesis 3 narrative
[800.32 --> 801.22]  where the serpent
[801.22 --> 802.34]  says to the woman,
[802.94 --> 805.66]  you can become like God.
[806.64 --> 807.60]  And as a society,
[807.72 --> 808.76]  we've tried to do it
[808.76 --> 810.18]  and it's not going well.
[812.00 --> 812.94]  Now, I just want to pause
[812.94 --> 813.18]  and ask,
[813.24 --> 814.22]  does this resonate with you?
[814.74 --> 815.44]  I mean, for those of us
[815.44 --> 816.10]  who are new to Canada,
[816.18 --> 816.96]  those of us who grew up
[816.96 --> 817.24]  in Canada,
[817.28 --> 817.80]  I want to make sure
[817.80 --> 819.20]  this isn't just like ideas
[819.20 --> 819.92]  about our society.
[820.18 --> 820.90]  This is the stuff
[820.90 --> 821.94]  that's our imaginations.
[822.46 --> 823.08]  This is the stuff
[823.08 --> 824.60]  we just expect to be normal
[824.60 --> 825.38]  in our society
[825.38 --> 826.06]  and it's not.
[827.70 --> 828.56]  And now I want to put
[828.56 --> 829.64]  a slide up on the screen.
[829.88 --> 830.84]  You're going to just appreciate
[830.84 --> 831.56]  just how beautiful
[831.56 --> 832.40]  and sophisticated
[832.40 --> 833.44]  this slide is.
[834.32 --> 835.00]  Yeah, this is why
[835.00 --> 835.52]  I didn't become
[835.52 --> 837.20]  an art major in school.
[837.72 --> 838.88]  I stayed in my lane
[838.88 --> 839.42]  of theology.
[840.02 --> 841.28]  But this really ties
[841.28 --> 842.46]  Pastor Jonathan's sermon
[842.46 --> 843.06]  last week
[843.06 --> 844.16]  with my sermon this week.
[844.68 --> 845.88]  You've got the Western story
[845.88 --> 846.88]  moving in one direction.
[846.98 --> 847.54]  I put it down
[847.54 --> 848.28]  because I really think
[848.28 --> 849.18]  it's a story of destruction.
[849.60 --> 850.06]  And you've got the
[850.06 --> 851.46]  biblical story moving up
[851.46 --> 852.24]  and we are living
[852.24 --> 853.18]  at the intersection,
[853.34 --> 854.18]  the crossroads
[854.18 --> 855.08]  of these two stories.
[855.36 --> 856.22]  And every day
[856.22 --> 857.36]  in your work,
[857.70 --> 858.40]  your social life,
[858.48 --> 858.96]  in school,
[859.10 --> 859.58]  in your leisure,
[859.58 --> 861.10]  you get to decide
[861.10 --> 862.50]  which story
[862.50 --> 863.18]  is going to shape
[863.18 --> 863.70]  your life.
[864.80 --> 865.60]  Which story
[865.60 --> 866.18]  am I going to allow
[866.18 --> 866.86]  to shape the way
[866.86 --> 867.52]  I do my work,
[867.78 --> 869.00]  the reason I take care
[869.00 --> 869.50]  of these people,
[869.84 --> 870.94]  what I give my money to
[870.94 --> 871.78]  or what I don't give
[871.78 --> 872.26]  my money to?
[872.42 --> 873.46]  There's going to be a story
[873.46 --> 874.48]  that shapes your habits,
[875.36 --> 875.92]  your practices,
[876.42 --> 877.64]  and the ambitions you have
[877.64 --> 878.36]  with the short life
[878.36 --> 878.74]  you're given.
[879.42 --> 880.24]  And let me just tease
[880.24 --> 880.82]  out the differences.
[880.98 --> 881.80]  Like I really want us
[881.80 --> 882.70]  to see how mutually
[882.70 --> 883.90]  incompatible
[883.90 --> 884.76]  these stories are.
[885.36 --> 886.02]  They are not just
[886.02 --> 886.78]  two stories running
[886.78 --> 887.72]  along the same tracks.
[888.00 --> 888.56]  They're going in
[888.56 --> 889.88]  completely different directions
[889.88 --> 890.64]  and forming you
[890.64 --> 891.12]  in a completely
[891.12 --> 891.66]  different way.
[892.04 --> 893.04]  The Western story
[893.04 --> 894.82]  starts with a chaotic
[894.82 --> 896.50]  world that comes
[896.50 --> 897.96]  into being
[897.96 --> 899.24]  through accidents.
[899.80 --> 901.00]  The biblical story
[901.00 --> 902.06]  starts with a triune
[902.06 --> 904.10]  God who out of love
[904.10 --> 905.22]  forms and fashions
[905.22 --> 906.42]  a good creation
[906.42 --> 907.84]  for us to cultivate
[907.84 --> 909.02]  and to enjoy.
[909.78 --> 910.66]  The problem
[910.66 --> 911.90]  in the Western story
[911.90 --> 913.00]  is superstition
[913.00 --> 913.84]  and religion
[913.84 --> 914.58]  and ignorance.
[914.58 --> 915.88]  the problem
[915.88 --> 917.00]  in the biblical story
[917.00 --> 917.80]  as Jonathan said
[917.80 --> 918.30]  last week
[918.30 --> 920.10]  is human rebellion
[920.10 --> 921.46]  and pride.
[922.36 --> 923.32]  The hero
[923.32 --> 924.40]  in the Western story
[924.40 --> 924.76]  is who?
[926.34 --> 927.08]  It's you.
[927.40 --> 927.92]  You know this.
[928.24 --> 929.48]  You are the solution.
[929.68 --> 930.40]  You are the savior
[930.40 --> 931.86]  in the Western story.
[932.10 --> 932.50]  The hero
[932.50 --> 933.40]  of the biblical story
[933.40 --> 934.28]  is Jesus Christ
[934.28 --> 935.12]  who saves us
[935.12 --> 936.48]  from us
[936.48 --> 938.30]  and all of our
[938.30 --> 939.20]  corrupt desires.
[940.18 --> 940.54]  And of course
[940.54 --> 941.28]  the goal of life,
[941.32 --> 942.12]  this is an important difference,
[942.20 --> 942.96]  the goal of life
[942.96 --> 943.98]  in the Western story
[943.98 --> 946.04]  is sort of to enjoy
[946.04 --> 947.08]  material prosperity,
[947.38 --> 948.44]  squeeze as much
[948.44 --> 949.40]  out of this short life
[949.40 --> 949.76]  you have
[949.76 --> 950.78]  because there is no life
[950.78 --> 951.42]  afterwards.
[951.92 --> 952.64]  The material world
[952.64 --> 953.30]  is all there is
[953.30 --> 954.76]  so enjoy the few moments
[954.76 --> 955.08]  you get
[955.08 --> 955.64]  because you are going
[955.64 --> 956.14]  to die
[956.14 --> 957.10]  and that's the end.
[957.44 --> 958.58]  And in the biblical story,
[959.26 --> 960.30]  the goal of life
[960.30 --> 961.50]  is to live
[961.50 --> 962.40]  in the way of Jesus
[962.40 --> 964.10]  who died and rose
[964.10 --> 964.70]  and promises
[964.70 --> 965.88]  a resurrected world
[965.88 --> 966.90]  where we get
[966.90 --> 967.78]  resurrected bodies
[967.78 --> 968.42]  to enjoy
[968.42 --> 969.54]  a perfected creation
[969.54 --> 969.98]  forever.
[969.98 --> 971.32]  do you now see
[971.32 --> 972.24]  how incompatible
[972.24 --> 973.04]  these stories are?
[973.90 --> 974.14]  Again,
[974.20 --> 975.06]  this is not just ideas.
[975.16 --> 976.08]  These are two powerful,
[976.28 --> 976.98]  compelling stories
[976.98 --> 978.58]  chasing after your heart,
[979.10 --> 980.00]  chasing after why
[980.00 --> 980.76]  you take the job
[980.76 --> 981.56]  and what you do with it,
[981.82 --> 982.58]  chasing after why
[982.58 --> 983.60]  you pick a certain degree
[983.60 --> 984.00]  in school.
[984.22 --> 985.04]  All of those things
[985.04 --> 986.44]  are deeply affected
[986.44 --> 988.04]  by one of these two stories.
[989.94 --> 991.06]  And now I want to ask
[991.06 --> 992.04]  an even harder question.
[992.70 --> 993.94]  Do we have the humility
[993.94 --> 995.98]  to name
[995.98 --> 997.10]  how powerfully
[997.10 --> 998.00]  all of us
[998.00 --> 998.62]  have been shaped
[998.62 --> 999.80]  by that Western story?
[1000.90 --> 1001.98]  Do we have the humility
[1001.98 --> 1002.50]  to say,
[1003.58 --> 1003.86]  yep,
[1004.98 --> 1006.12]  I went to university
[1006.12 --> 1007.24]  just to get a good job,
[1007.34 --> 1008.04]  to get a lot of money,
[1008.14 --> 1009.00]  to retire wealthy?
[1009.48 --> 1010.10]  That's the narrative.
[1010.30 --> 1010.52]  I mean,
[1010.58 --> 1012.12]  every guidance counselor
[1012.12 --> 1013.08]  in most schools today
[1013.08 --> 1013.34]  are like,
[1013.40 --> 1013.78]  you want to get
[1013.78 --> 1014.56]  a high-paying job?
[1014.72 --> 1015.60]  You don't have to like it.
[1015.66 --> 1016.04]  You don't have to have
[1016.04 --> 1016.54]  the gifts for it.
[1016.70 --> 1017.42]  You just have to do
[1017.42 --> 1018.20]  a high-paying job,
[1018.32 --> 1018.90]  suffer through it
[1018.90 --> 1019.98]  so you get lots of money
[1019.98 --> 1020.86]  and then you finally
[1020.86 --> 1021.56]  can do what you want
[1021.56 --> 1022.10]  when you retire.
[1022.32 --> 1023.64]  That narrative is baked
[1023.64 --> 1025.98]  in to our higher education.
[1026.80 --> 1027.44]  And if you look
[1027.44 --> 1027.94]  at enrollment,
[1027.94 --> 1028.96]  even in the universities,
[1029.16 --> 1030.22]  guess which enrollments
[1030.22 --> 1031.22]  always are the highest?
[1031.62 --> 1033.56]  The jobs that pay the most.
[1034.46 --> 1034.90]  And I just want
[1034.90 --> 1035.62]  to caveat here,
[1035.74 --> 1036.30]  it's hard to live
[1036.30 --> 1036.88]  in British Columbia,
[1037.38 --> 1037.96]  no judgment
[1037.96 --> 1038.76]  on high-paying jobs.
[1038.84 --> 1039.48]  We can be servants
[1039.48 --> 1039.94]  for the kingdom
[1039.94 --> 1040.62]  in every role,
[1040.80 --> 1041.58]  but it's a reality.
[1041.70 --> 1042.22]  We live with our
[1042.22 --> 1042.94]  Western story.
[1044.50 --> 1045.28]  I have a friend
[1045.28 --> 1045.90]  in the university,
[1046.02 --> 1046.60]  her name is Rachel,
[1047.18 --> 1048.22]  and we were both
[1048.22 --> 1049.00]  taking these courses.
[1049.12 --> 1050.22]  One was the biblical story
[1050.22 --> 1050.80]  and the other one
[1050.80 --> 1051.78]  was the cultural story.
[1052.18 --> 1052.82]  And we're taking them
[1052.82 --> 1053.44]  back to back
[1053.44 --> 1053.92]  except we did
[1053.92 --> 1054.82]  in opposite directions.
[1055.00 --> 1055.50]  I started with
[1055.50 --> 1056.08]  biblical story
[1056.08 --> 1056.50]  and she started
[1056.50 --> 1057.40]  with the Western story.
[1058.06 --> 1059.16]  After one of the classes
[1059.16 --> 1060.00]  on the Western story,
[1060.10 --> 1060.34]  Rachel,
[1060.52 --> 1060.90]  whose dorm
[1060.90 --> 1061.62]  was right beside me,
[1061.68 --> 1062.12]  she came over
[1062.12 --> 1062.58]  to our dorm,
[1062.68 --> 1063.72]  she plunked herself
[1063.72 --> 1064.58]  down on our couch
[1064.58 --> 1065.42]  and she was looking
[1065.42 --> 1066.22]  very distraught.
[1066.32 --> 1066.60]  I was like,
[1066.64 --> 1066.88]  Rachel,
[1067.10 --> 1067.68]  how are you doing?
[1067.80 --> 1067.96]  You know,
[1068.00 --> 1068.30]  she's like,
[1068.34 --> 1068.90]  I'm not good.
[1069.56 --> 1069.76]  I was like,
[1069.78 --> 1069.88]  well,
[1069.88 --> 1070.88]  why aren't you doing good?
[1070.96 --> 1071.24]  She says,
[1071.30 --> 1071.50]  well,
[1072.00 --> 1073.36]  I thought I was a Christian,
[1073.92 --> 1074.98]  but I'm taking this class
[1074.98 --> 1075.42]  right now
[1075.42 --> 1075.96]  and I realize
[1075.96 --> 1076.52]  I'm probably
[1076.52 --> 1077.66]  a secular humanist.
[1078.30 --> 1079.34]  I look at my ambitions,
[1079.52 --> 1080.20]  I look at what I want
[1080.20 --> 1080.96]  to do with my life
[1080.96 --> 1081.30]  and I'm like,
[1081.40 --> 1081.54]  oh,
[1081.94 --> 1082.62]  that sounds like
[1082.62 --> 1083.42]  the Western story.
[1084.14 --> 1084.52]  And I remember
[1084.52 --> 1085.38]  when she said this,
[1085.46 --> 1086.94]  she was dead serious
[1086.94 --> 1088.44]  because she was realizing,
[1088.76 --> 1090.30]  if I really think
[1090.30 --> 1090.86]  that the Bible
[1090.86 --> 1091.52]  is a true story,
[1091.64 --> 1092.58]  I'm not living in it.
[1092.62 --> 1093.58]  And she had the guts
[1093.58 --> 1094.62]  to say it.
[1095.08 --> 1095.80]  She realized
[1095.80 --> 1096.22]  that Christianity
[1096.22 --> 1097.04]  is not just saying
[1097.04 --> 1097.90]  Jesus is Lord,
[1098.14 --> 1098.88]  it's not just going
[1098.88 --> 1099.38]  to Sunday,
[1099.62 --> 1101.52]  church on Sunday morning,
[1101.76 --> 1102.64]  it's actually the whole
[1102.64 --> 1103.08]  of your life
[1103.08 --> 1103.92]  shaped by a story.
[1104.34 --> 1105.02]  And she had the guts
[1105.02 --> 1105.30]  to say,
[1105.42 --> 1106.52]  I'm not living in that story.
[1107.14 --> 1108.26]  I got some serious
[1108.26 --> 1108.92]  work to do.
[1112.48 --> 1113.62]  Now here's the shift
[1113.62 --> 1114.30]  in my sermon.
[1115.48 --> 1116.16]  And you should know
[1116.16 --> 1116.78]  this is a way
[1116.78 --> 1117.38]  of encouragement.
[1117.92 --> 1118.62]  Every church
[1118.62 --> 1120.54]  in every city
[1120.54 --> 1121.36]  around the world
[1121.36 --> 1123.06]  lives at the crossroads.
[1123.42 --> 1124.26]  There's some story
[1124.26 --> 1125.14]  that shapes every city,
[1125.20 --> 1125.82]  whether it's Eastern
[1125.82 --> 1126.30]  or Western,
[1126.42 --> 1126.86]  whether it's North
[1126.86 --> 1127.22]  or South,
[1127.28 --> 1127.86]  there are so many
[1127.86 --> 1128.46]  different stories
[1128.46 --> 1129.30]  in our world
[1129.30 --> 1130.74]  that shape societies.
[1130.92 --> 1131.50]  And Christians
[1131.50 --> 1133.08]  who are pulled out
[1133.08 --> 1133.64]  of that story
[1133.64 --> 1134.64]  by Jesus' grace
[1134.64 --> 1135.70]  and invited to live
[1135.70 --> 1136.70]  according to the scriptures,
[1137.10 --> 1138.54]  they have to wrestle with,
[1138.62 --> 1139.62]  how do I be faithful
[1139.62 --> 1140.38]  to the Bible
[1140.38 --> 1142.62]  and live as salt
[1142.62 --> 1143.18]  and light
[1143.18 --> 1143.96]  in this culture?
[1144.60 --> 1145.18]  And the culture
[1145.18 --> 1146.48]  that God has placed us in
[1146.48 --> 1147.46]  by His grace and mercy
[1147.46 --> 1148.64]  is the Western society.
[1148.78 --> 1149.32]  And we're not called
[1149.32 --> 1149.90]  to hate it.
[1150.78 --> 1151.12]  We're called
[1151.12 --> 1152.26]  to stand against the idols,
[1153.16 --> 1153.96]  called to resist
[1153.96 --> 1154.96]  the patterns of culture
[1154.96 --> 1155.62]  that are leading us
[1155.62 --> 1156.18]  to destruction,
[1156.52 --> 1157.50]  and invite people
[1157.50 --> 1158.60]  into the true story
[1158.60 --> 1159.48]  of the Bible
[1159.48 --> 1159.98]  or the hero
[1159.98 --> 1160.80]  is Jesus Christ.
[1162.84 --> 1163.98]  When Paul writes
[1163.98 --> 1164.60]  this letter,
[1164.64 --> 1165.58]  to the church in Rome,
[1165.68 --> 1166.64]  I want you to know,
[1167.22 --> 1167.96]  he was writing
[1167.96 --> 1168.82]  to a tiny,
[1168.90 --> 1169.80]  like just imagine this,
[1170.12 --> 1171.72]  a tiny little house church,
[1172.02 --> 1173.06]  way smaller
[1173.06 --> 1174.12]  than Hope Community Church,
[1174.18 --> 1174.30]  right?
[1174.32 --> 1175.14]  They fit in a home.
[1175.60 --> 1176.46]  And they lived
[1176.46 --> 1177.58]  in the big,
[1177.66 --> 1179.36]  bad Roman Empire.
[1179.62 --> 1179.80]  Like,
[1180.02 --> 1182.02]  they felt so small.
[1182.16 --> 1182.64]  And there are
[1182.64 --> 1183.64]  very few societies
[1183.64 --> 1184.84]  who knew how to tell
[1184.84 --> 1185.42]  their story
[1185.42 --> 1186.26]  like Rome did.
[1187.02 --> 1187.34]  You know,
[1187.44 --> 1188.22]  just to give you
[1188.22 --> 1189.44]  a really fast overview
[1189.44 --> 1190.28]  of the Roman story,
[1190.70 --> 1191.70]  they would bake it
[1191.70 --> 1192.48]  into their coins.
[1192.56 --> 1192.66]  Like,
[1192.66 --> 1193.38]  you look at a coin
[1193.38 --> 1193.82]  and it would have
[1193.82 --> 1195.38]  Caesar's face on it.
[1195.58 --> 1196.74]  They'd have military parades
[1196.74 --> 1197.68]  that would remind everyone
[1197.68 --> 1198.54]  that Caesar was,
[1198.60 --> 1199.38]  this is how they worshipped him,
[1199.72 --> 1200.80]  Caesar was the Lord.
[1201.70 --> 1202.32]  And if you're curious,
[1202.42 --> 1203.18]  the reason that
[1203.18 --> 1204.12]  the New Testament writers
[1204.12 --> 1205.06]  called Jesus Lord
[1205.06 --> 1206.30]  is a way of saying
[1206.30 --> 1207.46]  Caesar isn't.
[1207.54 --> 1208.20]  It's the same word,
[1208.32 --> 1208.80]  kurios.
[1209.34 --> 1210.04]  Jesus is Lord.
[1210.10 --> 1210.88]  Because everyone else
[1210.88 --> 1211.24]  in the city
[1211.24 --> 1212.48]  was worshipping Caesar
[1212.48 --> 1213.88]  as the Lord.
[1214.24 --> 1214.80]  And he brought
[1214.80 --> 1215.96]  a kingdom of peace
[1215.96 --> 1216.52]  through all his
[1216.52 --> 1217.30]  military victories.
[1217.60 --> 1217.90]  He brought
[1217.90 --> 1218.84]  the Pax Romana,
[1218.96 --> 1220.00]  the travel of peace
[1220.00 --> 1221.02]  throughout the Roman Empire.
[1221.02 --> 1222.44]  He was reminding everyone
[1222.44 --> 1223.54]  that you are a Roman.
[1223.86 --> 1224.88]  We have arrived.
[1225.12 --> 1226.98]  This is the best story
[1226.98 --> 1227.72]  for reality.
[1228.18 --> 1229.14]  Enjoy the gift
[1229.14 --> 1230.54]  of being a Roman citizen.
[1230.98 --> 1231.98]  And into that
[1231.98 --> 1233.30]  huge empire,
[1234.22 --> 1235.30]  Paul has the audacity
[1235.30 --> 1236.26]  to write to a tiny
[1236.26 --> 1237.08]  little house church
[1237.08 --> 1238.24]  these words
[1238.24 --> 1239.02]  in Romans 12.
[1240.46 --> 1241.02]  Therefore,
[1241.18 --> 1241.56]  I urge you
[1241.56 --> 1242.68]  as brothers and sisters,
[1243.48 --> 1244.70]  in view of God's mercy,
[1245.20 --> 1246.64]  to offer your bodies
[1246.64 --> 1248.14]  as a living sacrifice,
[1248.48 --> 1250.72]  holy and pleasing to God,
[1251.02 --> 1253.90]  this is true worship.
[1255.04 --> 1256.18]  Do not conform
[1256.18 --> 1256.92]  to the patterns
[1256.92 --> 1257.66]  of this world,
[1258.24 --> 1259.14]  but be transformed
[1259.14 --> 1260.04]  by the renewing
[1260.04 --> 1260.74]  of your mind.
[1261.28 --> 1262.00]  Then you'll be able
[1262.00 --> 1262.88]  to test and approve
[1262.88 --> 1264.18]  what God's will is,
[1264.22 --> 1264.72]  his good,
[1265.08 --> 1265.44]  pleasing,
[1265.82 --> 1267.48]  and perfect will.
[1268.56 --> 1269.12]  And the movement
[1269.12 --> 1269.80]  of that passage
[1269.80 --> 1270.16]  is,
[1270.60 --> 1271.50]  in view of what God
[1271.50 --> 1271.94]  has done,
[1272.08 --> 1273.32]  offer the whole
[1273.32 --> 1274.82]  of your life to him.
[1275.48 --> 1276.42]  Not just a sliver
[1276.42 --> 1277.04]  on Sunday morning,
[1277.16 --> 1277.84]  not just a tiny bit
[1277.84 --> 1278.30]  of your money,
[1278.76 --> 1279.70]  everything from
[1279.70 --> 1280.28]  your leisure,
[1280.52 --> 1281.00]  your money,
[1281.14 --> 1281.64]  your family,
[1281.78 --> 1282.22]  your marriage,
[1282.30 --> 1282.92]  your sexuality,
[1283.22 --> 1283.92]  all of it
[1283.92 --> 1284.86]  is an offering
[1284.86 --> 1285.46]  to God.
[1286.16 --> 1286.90]  And in order
[1286.90 --> 1287.66]  to do that well,
[1287.72 --> 1288.64]  you have to resist
[1288.64 --> 1289.40]  all the idols
[1289.40 --> 1290.02]  of your culture
[1290.02 --> 1290.56]  that live out
[1290.56 --> 1291.32]  of a different story,
[1291.52 --> 1292.56]  you have to discern
[1292.56 --> 1293.54]  the gospel
[1293.54 --> 1294.22]  in a new way
[1294.22 --> 1294.68]  of thinking,
[1295.04 --> 1296.08]  then you can test
[1296.08 --> 1296.80]  the will of God
[1296.80 --> 1297.36]  and live according
[1297.36 --> 1297.78]  to it.
[1297.78 --> 1299.94]  And what needed
[1299.94 --> 1301.10]  to happen in Rome
[1301.10 --> 1302.20]  and what needs
[1302.20 --> 1303.22]  to happen today
[1303.22 --> 1304.66]  is a break.
[1306.12 --> 1307.30]  What Christians knew
[1307.30 --> 1308.20]  in the early church,
[1308.28 --> 1308.92]  and there's a lot
[1308.92 --> 1309.74]  of writing about it,
[1309.78 --> 1310.76]  was that there is
[1310.76 --> 1312.24]  a powerful Roman story
[1312.24 --> 1313.40]  that was built
[1313.40 --> 1314.42]  on a false Messiah,
[1314.54 --> 1314.92]  the Caesar,
[1315.46 --> 1316.50]  and it had all sorts
[1316.50 --> 1317.04]  of rituals
[1317.04 --> 1318.00]  and reinforcements
[1318.00 --> 1318.58]  that the Christians
[1318.58 --> 1319.28]  need to say,
[1319.76 --> 1321.18]  we can't do that anymore
[1321.18 --> 1322.48]  because we believe
[1322.48 --> 1323.62]  Jesus is the hero
[1323.62 --> 1324.30]  of our story.
[1325.02 --> 1326.16]  And there was a break
[1326.16 --> 1326.90]  where they had to say,
[1326.90 --> 1328.08]  we can no longer
[1328.08 --> 1328.92]  worship the Caesar.
[1329.00 --> 1329.50]  And you should know
[1329.50 --> 1330.80]  that already in 80 AD,
[1331.38 --> 1332.78]  there were worship services
[1332.78 --> 1334.34]  where people would burn incense
[1334.34 --> 1335.58]  to worship the Caesar
[1335.58 --> 1336.06]  as Lord.
[1336.52 --> 1337.14]  And the Christians
[1337.14 --> 1337.70]  would say,
[1337.94 --> 1339.36]  can't do it.
[1339.76 --> 1340.26]  And many of them
[1340.26 --> 1340.84]  were persecuted
[1340.84 --> 1341.76]  and killed for that
[1341.76 --> 1342.30]  because they said,
[1342.34 --> 1342.74]  you know what?
[1343.00 --> 1343.98]  We know the Caesar
[1343.98 --> 1344.96]  is not the Lord.
[1345.60 --> 1346.54]  There were all sorts
[1346.54 --> 1347.92]  of feasts that took place
[1347.92 --> 1348.90]  to different gods,
[1348.96 --> 1349.38]  like Romans,
[1349.44 --> 1350.88]  a very polytheistic society,
[1351.16 --> 1351.94]  and people would go
[1351.94 --> 1352.88]  to these various temples,
[1353.04 --> 1353.90]  eat the various meats,
[1354.06 --> 1355.10]  enjoy the prostitutes
[1355.10 --> 1355.76]  at these temples,
[1355.76 --> 1356.62]  and the Christians
[1356.62 --> 1357.04]  would say,
[1357.40 --> 1359.00]  that's not who we are anymore.
[1359.96 --> 1361.06]  We now feast
[1361.06 --> 1361.74]  the Lord's Supper,
[1361.82 --> 1362.20]  which we're going
[1362.20 --> 1363.00]  to practice today,
[1363.36 --> 1364.26]  where we celebrate
[1364.26 --> 1365.08]  that King Jesus
[1365.08 --> 1366.18]  has won our salvation
[1366.18 --> 1366.80]  by his death
[1366.80 --> 1367.46]  and his resurrection.
[1368.50 --> 1369.14]  The Christians
[1369.14 --> 1369.66]  had to learn
[1369.66 --> 1370.94]  that going to the Colosseum,
[1371.00 --> 1371.88]  which celebrated
[1371.88 --> 1373.20]  violence and murder,
[1373.26 --> 1373.84]  was no longer
[1373.84 --> 1374.68]  what they could do.
[1374.88 --> 1375.98]  As believers in Rome,
[1376.06 --> 1376.34]  they said,
[1376.40 --> 1377.60]  that's not who we are.
[1377.82 --> 1378.34]  We are people
[1378.34 --> 1379.36]  who love life.
[1380.24 --> 1380.70]  We are people
[1380.70 --> 1381.70]  who seek reconciliation.
[1381.70 --> 1382.86]  We do not just watch
[1382.86 --> 1383.38]  and celebrate
[1383.38 --> 1384.80]  the murdering of people.
[1386.58 --> 1387.44]  On and on
[1387.44 --> 1387.98]  I could talk
[1387.98 --> 1388.56]  about how Christians
[1388.56 --> 1389.38]  had to break
[1389.38 --> 1390.42]  from these old patterns,
[1390.62 --> 1392.04]  these old habits of life,
[1392.32 --> 1394.30]  and learn together
[1394.30 --> 1396.16]  how to worship Jesus,
[1396.54 --> 1397.22]  live according
[1397.22 --> 1397.86]  to the scriptures,
[1398.12 --> 1399.52]  and honor the design
[1399.52 --> 1400.34]  that God had
[1400.34 --> 1401.12]  for human life,
[1401.24 --> 1402.42]  which meant resisting
[1402.42 --> 1404.26]  the idols of Rome.
[1405.54 --> 1406.36]  And let me just say
[1406.36 --> 1407.46]  as clearly as I can,
[1407.60 --> 1408.76]  that same invitation
[1408.76 --> 1410.04]  goes to the church today.
[1410.44 --> 1411.16]  We don't live
[1411.16 --> 1411.78]  in the Roman story,
[1411.84 --> 1413.04]  we live in the Western story.
[1413.04 --> 1414.14]  And let me just say
[1414.14 --> 1415.06]  a few ways
[1415.06 --> 1415.50]  where I think
[1415.50 --> 1416.08]  there has to be
[1416.08 --> 1416.96]  that break
[1416.96 --> 1417.96]  in such a way
[1417.96 --> 1418.60]  that we follow
[1418.60 --> 1419.72]  the liberating work
[1419.72 --> 1420.14]  of Jesus.
[1421.36 --> 1421.98]  As we live
[1421.98 --> 1422.98]  in the Western story,
[1423.40 --> 1424.22]  Jesus invites us
[1424.22 --> 1424.92]  to say no
[1424.92 --> 1426.80]  to ruling our own life.
[1427.40 --> 1428.12]  Did you hear that?
[1428.78 --> 1430.18]  No to governing
[1430.18 --> 1431.36]  our own life
[1431.36 --> 1432.94]  so that we can be led
[1432.94 --> 1434.28]  by King Jesus.
[1435.26 --> 1436.08]  In our culture,
[1436.18 --> 1436.88]  we say no
[1436.88 --> 1438.44]  to aimless consumption,
[1439.36 --> 1440.38]  wasteful purchasing
[1440.38 --> 1441.70]  with Amazon Prime,
[1442.08 --> 1443.10]  among other things,
[1443.26 --> 1444.78]  so that we can say yes
[1444.78 --> 1446.14]  to selfless generosity
[1446.14 --> 1447.76]  to where the real needs are.
[1448.96 --> 1450.16]  As we follow Jesus
[1450.16 --> 1451.12]  in Western society,
[1451.22 --> 1451.88]  we say no
[1451.88 --> 1453.42]  to instant gratification,
[1454.08 --> 1455.36]  and yes
[1455.36 --> 1456.52]  to the patient care
[1456.52 --> 1457.20]  of others.
[1458.54 --> 1459.62]  In our society,
[1459.74 --> 1460.46]  we say no
[1460.46 --> 1461.70]  to the preoccupation
[1461.70 --> 1462.94]  with the present,
[1463.28 --> 1464.00]  an obsession
[1464.00 --> 1464.68]  with living
[1464.68 --> 1465.78]  in the here and now,
[1465.98 --> 1466.60]  and yes
[1466.60 --> 1467.78]  to hope for the future.
[1467.78 --> 1470.36]  As we follow Jesus
[1470.36 --> 1471.36]  in Western society,
[1471.46 --> 1472.16]  we say no
[1472.16 --> 1473.22]  to determining
[1473.22 --> 1474.84]  and hashing together
[1474.84 --> 1475.76]  our own morals,
[1475.86 --> 1476.42]  whatever we think
[1476.42 --> 1477.02]  they should be,
[1477.26 --> 1477.84]  and yes
[1477.84 --> 1478.74]  to submitting
[1478.74 --> 1480.68]  to the good instruction
[1480.68 --> 1481.42]  of the scriptures
[1481.42 --> 1483.10]  for how to live
[1483.10 --> 1483.90]  with our finances,
[1484.56 --> 1485.22]  our relationship,
[1485.70 --> 1486.56]  and especially
[1486.56 --> 1487.48]  our sexuality
[1487.48 --> 1490.08]  in a very immoral society.
[1491.34 --> 1491.90]  These are just
[1491.90 --> 1492.74]  a few of the ways
[1492.74 --> 1493.34]  that we are invited
[1493.34 --> 1494.30]  to make that break
[1494.30 --> 1495.54]  from our cultural story
[1495.54 --> 1497.64]  to follow the life
[1497.64 --> 1498.26]  of Jesus.
[1499.58 --> 1500.14]  Can I just say
[1500.14 --> 1501.04]  two things about that?
[1502.08 --> 1502.60]  Number one,
[1502.64 --> 1503.08]  it's hard.
[1504.16 --> 1505.24]  I think it is a failure
[1505.24 --> 1505.92]  for pastors
[1505.92 --> 1506.56]  and for churches
[1506.56 --> 1508.00]  to present Christianity
[1508.00 --> 1508.98]  as such a simple,
[1509.12 --> 1509.62]  easy decision.
[1509.72 --> 1510.20]  All you have to do
[1510.20 --> 1510.90]  is say this.
[1511.24 --> 1512.14]  That is not
[1512.14 --> 1512.80]  what we read
[1512.80 --> 1513.34]  in the New Testament.
[1513.46 --> 1514.04]  There's a sense of
[1514.04 --> 1515.24]  you now get to take
[1515.24 --> 1516.22]  the whole of your life
[1516.22 --> 1517.68]  and you have to learn
[1517.68 --> 1518.20]  how to offer
[1518.20 --> 1519.52]  every piece of it
[1519.52 --> 1520.06]  to God.
[1520.36 --> 1520.56]  I mean,
[1520.58 --> 1521.60]  it's a big ask,
[1521.66 --> 1522.16]  don't you think,
[1522.22 --> 1522.74]  Romans 12?
[1523.12 --> 1524.06]  Offer the whole
[1524.06 --> 1524.98]  of your life
[1524.98 --> 1526.10]  as a sacrifice
[1526.10 --> 1526.62]  to God.
[1526.70 --> 1527.50]  That is not easy.
[1527.84 --> 1528.80]  Giving up control,
[1529.98 --> 1530.42]  giving up
[1530.42 --> 1531.60]  your personal autonomy,
[1531.96 --> 1532.98]  actually saying to yourself,
[1533.24 --> 1534.36]  I don't know
[1534.36 --> 1535.16]  what's best
[1535.16 --> 1536.70]  and I am submitting
[1536.70 --> 1537.38]  to the authority
[1537.38 --> 1538.40]  of Jesus who loves me.
[1538.50 --> 1539.06]  That's hard.
[1539.74 --> 1540.38]  But secondly,
[1540.62 --> 1541.26]  and this came after
[1541.26 --> 1541.82]  a conversation
[1541.82 --> 1542.50]  two weeks ago
[1542.50 --> 1542.92]  with someone
[1542.92 --> 1544.66]  just had a long chat
[1544.66 --> 1545.68]  about living out
[1545.68 --> 1546.20]  of a story.
[1546.94 --> 1547.86]  I think Christianity
[1547.86 --> 1549.02]  requires a lot
[1549.02 --> 1549.66]  of learning.
[1551.28 --> 1551.90]  There is,
[1552.10 --> 1552.56]  I think,
[1552.68 --> 1553.50]  for whatever reason
[1553.50 --> 1554.10]  in the West,
[1554.78 --> 1555.88]  in the Canadian church
[1555.88 --> 1556.18]  anyway,
[1556.28 --> 1556.92]  this idea that,
[1556.98 --> 1557.28]  you know what,
[1557.30 --> 1558.02]  I'll just go to church
[1558.02 --> 1559.28]  maybe once or twice a month,
[1559.36 --> 1560.40]  that's the average I'm told.
[1560.96 --> 1561.62]  Maybe I'll listen
[1561.62 --> 1562.38]  to a sermon or so,
[1562.44 --> 1562.88]  but I'm not going
[1562.88 --> 1563.48]  to get involved
[1563.48 --> 1564.10]  in a small group
[1564.10 --> 1564.54]  and I'm not going
[1564.54 --> 1565.20]  to read my Bible.
[1565.46 --> 1565.92]  I'm not going
[1565.92 --> 1566.58]  to listen to somebody
[1566.58 --> 1567.44]  teach about Jesus.
[1567.58 --> 1568.00]  I'm just going
[1568.00 --> 1569.66]  to do the bare minimum
[1569.66 --> 1570.22]  and there's not
[1570.22 --> 1570.80]  a lot of learning.
[1571.96 --> 1572.54]  And as a result,
[1572.66 --> 1573.52]  people don't struggle
[1573.52 --> 1574.72]  with how to live faithfully.
[1575.48 --> 1576.46]  People don't struggle
[1576.46 --> 1577.20]  with how to live
[1577.20 --> 1578.06]  according to the Scriptures.
[1578.26 --> 1578.82]  People don't really
[1578.82 --> 1579.28]  even know
[1579.28 --> 1579.78]  what the Bible
[1579.78 --> 1580.58]  is teaching us
[1580.58 --> 1581.56]  about how to live.
[1582.28 --> 1583.04]  And I want to say,
[1583.04 --> 1583.48]  if you're new
[1583.48 --> 1584.20]  to the faith here,
[1584.60 --> 1585.22]  you're invited
[1585.22 --> 1586.26]  to hard work
[1586.26 --> 1587.70]  and you're inviting
[1587.70 --> 1589.62]  to a lifelong process
[1589.62 --> 1590.18]  of learning
[1590.18 --> 1590.88]  the way of Jesus.
[1591.40 --> 1592.20]  Do you know this?
[1593.02 --> 1593.74]  I don't want to give
[1593.74 --> 1594.58]  any false impressions
[1594.58 --> 1595.22]  of Christianity
[1595.22 --> 1595.92]  to anyone who might
[1595.92 --> 1596.76]  be new to the faith here.
[1597.02 --> 1597.92]  That is the invitation
[1597.92 --> 1598.82]  of Romans 12.
[1599.76 --> 1600.78]  But here's the good news.
[1600.84 --> 1601.42]  You ready for it?
[1602.52 --> 1603.66]  The good news is
[1603.66 --> 1605.40]  Jesus never invites you
[1605.40 --> 1606.26]  to a painful,
[1606.68 --> 1607.24]  joyless,
[1607.48 --> 1608.30]  dull life.
[1608.90 --> 1610.02]  Whatever Jesus invites
[1610.02 --> 1610.80]  you to say no to
[1610.80 --> 1611.64]  is because he's inviting
[1611.64 --> 1612.50]  you to say yes
[1612.50 --> 1613.68]  to the fullness
[1613.68 --> 1615.20]  of human life.
[1615.76 --> 1616.60]  We put to death
[1616.60 --> 1617.88]  only that which brings
[1617.88 --> 1618.72]  dehumanization
[1618.72 --> 1619.50]  and pain
[1619.50 --> 1620.28]  and destruction
[1620.28 --> 1621.02]  to our lives
[1621.02 --> 1622.08]  and saying yes
[1622.08 --> 1623.22]  to that which is
[1623.22 --> 1623.90]  the life God
[1623.90 --> 1624.92]  created us to live.
[1626.54 --> 1627.74]  One of my favorite writers
[1627.74 --> 1628.68]  is Dallas Willard.
[1629.56 --> 1630.18]  And Dallas Willard
[1630.18 --> 1631.28]  has this long reflection
[1631.28 --> 1633.22]  on the Gospel of Matthew
[1633.22 --> 1634.24]  where Jesus says,
[1635.24 --> 1636.70]  come after me,
[1636.70 --> 1638.80]  all you who are weary
[1638.80 --> 1639.88]  and heavy laden.
[1639.92 --> 1640.64]  And what does he say next?
[1640.80 --> 1643.44]  I will give you rest.
[1644.74 --> 1647.22]  Take my yoke upon you
[1647.22 --> 1648.68]  and learn from me
[1648.68 --> 1649.76]  for I am gentle
[1649.76 --> 1651.04]  and humble in heart.
[1651.22 --> 1652.42]  That verse is so powerful.
[1652.54 --> 1653.06]  But notice,
[1653.46 --> 1654.10]  Jesus says,
[1654.22 --> 1654.96]  there is a yoke
[1654.96 --> 1655.56]  in that image.
[1655.96 --> 1656.92]  I massacred this
[1656.92 --> 1657.78]  in the 9 a.m. service.
[1657.92 --> 1658.34]  I had a farmer
[1658.34 --> 1658.82]  help me out.
[1659.24 --> 1660.02]  The image of a yoke
[1660.02 --> 1661.16]  is what you put on an ox
[1661.16 --> 1662.62]  as they pull the till,
[1662.76 --> 1663.36]  as they pull,
[1663.68 --> 1664.68]  and now I'm forgetting it again,
[1665.32 --> 1666.28]  the plow, thank you.
[1666.36 --> 1666.92]  Now I know who's
[1666.92 --> 1667.52]  in both services.
[1668.12 --> 1668.92]  They pull the plow
[1668.92 --> 1669.70]  and there's a weight
[1669.70 --> 1670.46]  to that yoke.
[1670.88 --> 1672.08]  And this is the beauty of it.
[1672.26 --> 1672.86]  There's a weight
[1672.86 --> 1673.90]  to the yoke of Christianity.
[1674.08 --> 1675.16]  And Dallas Willard says,
[1675.74 --> 1676.62]  there is a cost
[1676.62 --> 1677.50]  to discipleship.
[1678.28 --> 1679.58]  There is work involved.
[1680.28 --> 1682.00]  But the light yoke
[1682.00 --> 1682.72]  of Jesus
[1682.72 --> 1684.96]  is nothing compared
[1684.96 --> 1686.72]  to the crushing yoke
[1686.72 --> 1688.10]  of trying to rule
[1688.10 --> 1688.96]  your own life.
[1690.06 --> 1691.30]  The light yoke
[1691.30 --> 1692.04]  of obedience
[1692.04 --> 1693.14]  to Jesus' way
[1693.14 --> 1694.54]  is nothing compared
[1694.54 --> 1695.48]  to the crushing yoke
[1695.48 --> 1696.70]  of trying to run
[1696.70 --> 1698.38]  the show of your life.
[1699.04 --> 1699.82]  And I'm convinced,
[1699.92 --> 1700.56]  I said this in the end,
[1700.60 --> 1701.06]  I'll say it again,
[1701.26 --> 1701.82]  I'm convinced
[1701.82 --> 1702.66]  that there's a lot of us
[1702.66 --> 1703.22]  who are here
[1703.22 --> 1704.48]  because we tried
[1704.48 --> 1705.26]  to do the whole
[1705.26 --> 1705.98]  Western thing.
[1706.22 --> 1706.80]  We tried to say,
[1706.88 --> 1707.36]  you know what,
[1707.46 --> 1708.94]  I'm an autonomous individual.
[1709.36 --> 1710.26]  No one's going to tell me
[1710.26 --> 1711.12]  how to live my life.
[1711.32 --> 1712.18]  I know what's best.
[1712.34 --> 1713.48]  And you made a mess
[1713.48 --> 1714.24]  of your life.
[1715.30 --> 1716.14]  You made a mess
[1716.14 --> 1716.94]  of your relationships.
[1717.08 --> 1717.58]  There's a path
[1717.58 --> 1718.18]  of destruction
[1718.18 --> 1719.40]  around your family
[1719.40 --> 1720.44]  because of what you've done,
[1720.52 --> 1721.38]  the addictions you have,
[1721.70 --> 1722.96]  whatever sinful patterns
[1722.96 --> 1723.46]  you don't know
[1723.46 --> 1724.00]  how to deal with.
[1724.00 --> 1724.90]  You've made a mess
[1724.90 --> 1725.58]  and you finally say,
[1725.74 --> 1725.94]  okay,
[1726.58 --> 1727.74]  clearly I'm not cut out
[1727.74 --> 1728.44]  to be in control.
[1728.60 --> 1729.56]  I will try Jesus.
[1731.22 --> 1732.48]  And Jesus in his love
[1732.48 --> 1733.06]  and his power
[1733.06 --> 1733.90]  and his mercy says,
[1734.22 --> 1734.98]  follow me
[1734.98 --> 1736.44]  and I will show you
[1736.44 --> 1737.20]  the way of life.
[1738.34 --> 1739.48]  That's why a lot of us
[1739.48 --> 1739.74]  are here,
[1739.82 --> 1740.62]  even this morning.
[1741.00 --> 1741.60]  We have learned
[1741.60 --> 1742.76]  that the crushing yoke
[1742.76 --> 1743.84]  of ruling
[1743.84 --> 1744.44]  and governing
[1744.44 --> 1745.32]  our own lives
[1745.32 --> 1746.32]  is not meant
[1746.32 --> 1747.28]  for humans to carry.
[1748.04 --> 1749.80]  We are not the Savior.
[1750.30 --> 1751.32]  We are not the ones
[1751.32 --> 1752.38]  who build the better world.
[1752.38 --> 1753.46]  That's up for Jesus
[1753.46 --> 1754.82]  and he invites us
[1754.82 --> 1755.86]  to put on the light
[1755.86 --> 1757.74]  yoke of discipleship
[1757.74 --> 1759.32]  to live according
[1759.32 --> 1760.00]  to the scriptures.
[1760.98 --> 1761.64]  And when Jesus
[1761.64 --> 1763.14]  invites us to obedience,
[1763.38 --> 1764.02]  when we read
[1764.02 --> 1764.94]  the story of the Bible,
[1765.06 --> 1765.74]  we are invited
[1765.74 --> 1767.14]  to live in liberation.
[1768.92 --> 1769.44]  We are invited
[1769.44 --> 1770.20]  to say yes
[1770.20 --> 1770.68]  to the one
[1770.68 --> 1771.76]  who created us,
[1772.24 --> 1773.70]  who knows how our lives
[1773.70 --> 1774.60]  are meant to be lived,
[1774.60 --> 1776.26]  and find a way
[1776.26 --> 1776.96]  of flourishing
[1776.96 --> 1778.26]  through obedience
[1778.26 --> 1779.10]  to the word.
[1782.36 --> 1783.32]  Let me finish
[1783.32 --> 1784.62]  with what I think
[1784.62 --> 1785.02]  is actually
[1785.02 --> 1786.22]  the most important phrase
[1786.22 --> 1786.98]  in this passage.
[1787.70 --> 1788.26]  Did you notice
[1788.26 --> 1789.04]  how Paul started
[1789.04 --> 1789.70]  this passage?
[1791.18 --> 1792.16]  In view
[1792.16 --> 1794.24]  of God's
[1794.24 --> 1795.14]  mercy.
[1796.46 --> 1797.44]  That's Paul's way
[1797.44 --> 1797.82]  of saying,
[1797.94 --> 1798.66]  in view of
[1798.66 --> 1799.66]  the gospel,
[1800.04 --> 1800.44]  right?
[1800.76 --> 1801.64]  I'm asking you
[1801.64 --> 1802.44]  to invite the whole
[1802.44 --> 1803.00]  of your lives
[1803.00 --> 1803.44]  to Jesus
[1803.44 --> 1804.18]  because Jesus
[1804.18 --> 1804.66]  has come
[1804.66 --> 1805.46]  all the way
[1805.46 --> 1805.96]  to you
[1805.96 --> 1806.76]  in his death
[1806.76 --> 1807.38]  and resurrection,
[1807.76 --> 1808.52]  in his life
[1808.52 --> 1809.16]  and his grace
[1809.16 --> 1810.64]  to make you alive
[1810.64 --> 1812.24]  in his resurrection life.
[1812.32 --> 1812.86]  He has come
[1812.86 --> 1814.68]  all the way
[1814.68 --> 1816.04]  to make you new,
[1816.58 --> 1817.38]  to heal the mess
[1817.38 --> 1818.06]  of your life,
[1818.24 --> 1818.88]  and to pour
[1818.88 --> 1819.98]  his grace over you.
[1821.24 --> 1822.00]  One of my favorite
[1822.00 --> 1822.96]  writers summarizes
[1822.96 --> 1823.56]  the beginning
[1823.56 --> 1824.28]  of Romans 12
[1824.28 --> 1824.74]  in this way.
[1824.84 --> 1825.08]  He says,
[1825.18 --> 1825.76]  Christian living
[1825.76 --> 1826.64]  never begins
[1826.64 --> 1827.44]  with a set of rules.
[1827.54 --> 1828.10]  Did you hear that?
[1828.36 --> 1828.90]  Christian living
[1828.90 --> 1829.68]  never begins
[1829.68 --> 1830.36]  with a set of rules,
[1830.44 --> 1831.38]  although it contains
[1831.38 --> 1832.94]  them as it goes forward.
[1833.00 --> 1834.04]  It begins
[1834.04 --> 1834.98]  with the glad
[1834.98 --> 1836.72]  self-offering
[1836.72 --> 1838.16]  of one's whole self
[1838.16 --> 1838.82]  to God
[1838.82 --> 1840.60]  whose mercy
[1840.60 --> 1841.10]  has come
[1841.10 --> 1842.04]  all the way
[1842.04 --> 1843.64]  to meet us
[1843.64 --> 1844.30]  in rebellion,
[1844.98 --> 1845.32]  sin,
[1846.00 --> 1846.70]  and death.
[1848.14 --> 1849.10]  Do you know
[1849.10 --> 1849.58]  that Jesus
[1849.58 --> 1850.84]  has come all the way
[1850.84 --> 1852.08]  for us?
[1852.76 --> 1853.62]  In the lowest,
[1853.78 --> 1854.82]  most broken moments
[1854.82 --> 1855.28]  of rebellion
[1855.28 --> 1855.98]  in our lives,
[1856.06 --> 1856.96]  the grace of Jesus
[1856.96 --> 1858.86]  is ours.
[1860.04 --> 1861.14]  And his word to us
[1861.14 --> 1861.92]  as we make a mess
[1861.92 --> 1862.56]  of our lives
[1862.56 --> 1862.92]  is,
[1863.58 --> 1864.44]  follow me.
[1865.60 --> 1866.54]  My yoke
[1866.54 --> 1867.46]  is light.
[1868.26 --> 1869.60]  I will truly
[1869.60 --> 1871.12]  bring you life.
[1872.04 --> 1873.76]  I am the Savior
[1873.76 --> 1875.28]  of the world.
[1878.08 --> 1878.68]  That
[1878.68 --> 1880.40]  is the good news.
[1881.26 --> 1881.96]  Would you join me
[1881.96 --> 1882.30]  in prayer?
[1882.30 --> 1889.40]  Father,
[1889.48 --> 1890.42]  we want to praise you
[1890.42 --> 1892.12]  for the way
[1892.12 --> 1892.66]  that your grace
[1892.66 --> 1893.06]  and mercy
[1893.06 --> 1893.68]  has met us
[1893.68 --> 1894.38]  in our lives.
[1895.22 --> 1896.54]  You know our stories.
[1896.98 --> 1898.06]  You know our rebellion.
[1898.80 --> 1899.86]  You know all the ways
[1899.86 --> 1901.68]  we try to rule ourselves.
[1903.08 --> 1903.74]  And you know
[1903.74 --> 1904.72]  the mess we've made.
[1905.78 --> 1906.24]  And yet you
[1906.24 --> 1906.86]  in your grace
[1906.86 --> 1907.60]  and your mercy
[1907.60 --> 1908.76]  have met us
[1908.76 --> 1909.38]  in our sin.
[1910.14 --> 1911.24]  You have forgiven us
[1911.24 --> 1912.10]  by the cross.
[1912.10 --> 1913.44]  And you invite us
[1913.44 --> 1914.38]  to resurrection life.
[1914.44 --> 1915.12]  We thank you
[1915.12 --> 1915.60]  for that.
[1916.74 --> 1917.28]  But Lord,
[1917.36 --> 1917.88]  the story
[1917.88 --> 1918.82]  of our society
[1918.82 --> 1920.12]  is so deeply
[1920.12 --> 1920.96]  ingrained
[1920.96 --> 1921.86]  in our bones.
[1922.74 --> 1923.64]  It pulls
[1923.64 --> 1924.40]  at our hearts
[1924.40 --> 1924.92]  when we go
[1924.92 --> 1925.40]  to school.
[1926.34 --> 1927.56]  It lures us
[1927.56 --> 1928.24]  as we go
[1928.24 --> 1928.94]  into the workplace.
[1929.82 --> 1930.36]  And we pray
[1930.36 --> 1931.00]  that your spirit
[1931.00 --> 1931.70]  would fill us
[1931.70 --> 1932.46]  to be salt
[1932.46 --> 1933.26]  and light.
[1933.74 --> 1934.52]  To have the power
[1934.52 --> 1935.86]  to resist idolatry
[1935.86 --> 1936.86]  so that we say yes
[1936.86 --> 1938.02]  to the way of Christ
[1938.02 --> 1939.30]  and live according
[1939.30 --> 1939.98]  to the scriptures.
[1939.98 --> 1940.90]  Spirit,
[1940.98 --> 1941.78]  would you fill us
[1941.78 --> 1942.56]  to be faithful
[1942.56 --> 1944.36]  such that this city
[1944.36 --> 1945.50]  would see in our church
[1945.50 --> 1947.54]  life that is truly life.
[1948.30 --> 1949.04]  Would you receive
[1949.04 --> 1949.62]  all the honor
[1949.62 --> 1950.28]  and praise?
[1950.90 --> 1951.14]  Amen.
[1951.14 --> 1953.76]  I invite you to stand
[1953.76 --> 1954.42]  and sing with me
[1954.42 --> 1955.70]  a song of response.
[1956.22 --> 1959.20]  to the center Ram
[1959.20 --> 1961.78]  to the left of the
[1962.92 --> 1962.96]  verse.
