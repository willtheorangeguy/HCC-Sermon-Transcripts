[0.00 → 3.08] Good morning, Hope.
[6.08 → 9.94] This morning we get to continue our series on the book of Ruth.
[10.88 → 18.88] And as we get into the text, which I will explain and expand on how there have been a lot of misconception,
[19.32 → 21.28] especially about this chapter and this scene.
[21.28 → 31.18] Before we get into it, I want to lay the foundations to express what I suggest that is the main takeaway from this chapter.
[31.92 → 33.60] And the main takeaway is this.
[34.18 → 42.72] God continues to work his purpose and his will for redemption, even in the midst of chaos, brokenness, and sin.
[43.38 → 50.86] That's the underlying theme, the theology behind the book of Ruth in general, and more specifically through our chapter today.
[52.02 → 60.36] And so as God continues to work through all the brokenness, God also uses us today in that same way,
[60.72 → 64.78] in our brokenness, through redemption of that brokenness.
[64.84 → 74.02] And to first, for us, we want to recognize along with God and share his heart to see the brokenness.
[74.14 → 76.00] And it reminds me of the Beatitude series.
[76.00 → 81.76] Blessed are those who mourn, those who share God's heart, for you shall be comforted,
[81.96 → 86.02] because we are now participating in God's plan of redemption.
[86.94 → 92.86] And so through our ordinary acts of kindness that Pastor Dave touched on last week, the chased,
[93.50 → 101.54] today we look more specifically at the act of honour and integrity that is reflected in the characters of Boaz and Ruth especially.
[101.54 → 104.18] And so I invite you to turn with me to Ruth 3.
[104.48 → 108.18] And as it is a story, we want to read this full chapter together.
[109.24 → 112.80] It'll be on the screen for you, but if you have your own Bible or your phone,
[112.94 → 114.50] so you can pull it out to Ruth 3.
[114.64 → 119.10] And we continue this story of God's redemption through these people.
[119.10 → 123.28] One day, Ruth's mother-in-law Naomi said to her,
[123.64 → 129.76] My daughter, I must find a home for you, where you will be well provided for.
[130.22 → 133.58] Now Boaz, with whose women you have worked, is a relative of ours.
[134.14 → 136.76] Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.
[137.26 → 140.12] Wash, put on perfume, and get dressed in your best clothes.
[140.60 → 145.46] Then go down to the threshing floor, but don't let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.
[145.46 → 148.98] When he lies down, note the place where he is lying.
[149.30 → 151.70] Then go and uncover his feet and lie down.
[152.02 → 153.12] He will tell you what to do.
[153.68 → 155.86] I will do whatever you say, Ruth answered.
[156.22 → 160.10] So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do.
[161.02 → 164.68] When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits,
[164.84 → 167.78] he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile.
[168.40 → 171.58] Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.
[172.36 → 174.66] In the middle of the night, something startled the man.
[174.66 → 177.18] He turned, and there was a woman lying at his feet.
[177.72 → 178.32] Who are you?
[178.40 → 178.86] He asked.
[179.34 → 181.46] I am your servant, Ruth, she said.
[181.90 → 187.20] Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are the guardian redeemer of our family.
[187.84 → 190.10] The Lord bless you, my daughter, he replied.
[190.42 → 193.24] This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier.
[193.68 → 196.88] You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor.
[197.28 → 199.18] I will do for you all you ask.
[199.68 → 203.64] All the people of my town know that you are a woman of noble character.
[203.64 → 207.14] Although it is true that I am a guardian redeemer of our family,
[207.24 → 210.22] there is another who is more closely related than I.
[211.00 → 215.86] Stay here for the night, and in the morning, if he wants to do his duty as your guardian redeemer,
[215.98 → 217.50] good, let him redeem you.
[218.10 → 222.98] But if he is not willing, as surely as the Lord lives, I will do it.
[223.50 → 224.66] Lie here until the morning.
[224.66 → 229.06] So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized,
[229.68 → 233.32] and he said, no one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor.
[234.12 → 237.68] He also said, bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.
[238.04 → 242.76] When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and placed the bundle on her.
[243.02 → 244.72] Then he went back to town.
[245.30 → 248.60] When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, how did it go?
[248.60 → 255.18] Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her and added, he gave me these six measures of barley,
[255.34 → 259.74] saying, don't go back to your mother-in-law empty or empty-handed.
[260.54 → 264.34] Then Naomi said, wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens,
[264.70 → 269.42] for the man will not rest until the matter is settled today.
[269.42 → 279.04] Well, reading this story, it reminded me of the time when Moon and I were dating when we were younger.
[279.46 → 282.90] We attended a Christian marriage counselling seminar together.
[283.68 → 287.86] I don't remember too much from the sessions, but one thing that has stuck with me
[287.86 → 291.94] is how the counsellor called our spouses our angels.
[292.70 → 296.78] And you could be thinking, aw, your spouse is your angel, your beautiful angel.
[296.78 → 304.48] But biblically speaking, angels are not necessarily winged creatures with halos on top of their heads,
[304.64 → 306.20] like some sort of beautiful creature.
[307.06 → 309.98] In reality, they are messengers.
[310.20 → 311.30] That's what their title means.
[311.42 → 313.10] Angel means message and messenger.
[313.94 → 316.86] And sometimes, or maybe most of the time,
[317.30 → 323.16] the messages that we hear from our angels are not things that we want to necessarily hear.
[323.16 → 333.84] And so in that sense, our angelic spouses are people who know more in detail of the brokenness that we face.
[334.02 → 337.94] You can hide it with everybody else, whatever relationship you have,
[338.00 → 341.08] but it's really, really difficult to hide it to your spouse.
[341.08 → 346.44] And so whether in healthy, intentional ways or not,
[346.96 → 353.26] our spouses, our angel spouses provoke our brokenness so that we are forced to deal with them.
[353.94 → 357.64] And ideally, hopefully, we turn to God for healing.
[358.74 → 364.46] And so this act of poking at our pain, the deepest pain and brokenness within us,
[364.46 → 370.74] and to motivate us to seek that healing doesn't necessarily have to even be with our spouses, does it?
[371.38 → 376.56] It can be any relationship that you have where you know the person enough
[376.56 → 380.80] or you care about the person enough to name that brokenness,
[380.88 → 386.56] to provoke it, to poke at it, and to journey with them toward healing, toward God.
[386.56 → 394.42] And so in this sense, that's the picture I got when Naomi initiates the plan of redemption
[394.42 → 395.74] at the beginning of this chapter.
[396.38 → 402.40] What Naomi does is she names the brokenness in Ruth's situation here.
[403.76 → 408.54] What Naomi recognizes is that there is something not right for Ruth.
[409.06 → 415.06] Yes, they're managing now through the kindness of Boaz that we saw last week in chapter 2, excuse me.
[415.06 → 421.08] And they're managing, but she still recognizes that there is no true home.
[421.60 → 425.66] And the word for home that we see at the beginning of chapter 3 is the Hebrew word Banach,
[426.12 → 430.86] which has a significance of a resting place, a place of refuge,
[431.14 → 435.26] or just even the condition of rest and security itself.
[435.80 → 440.98] She knows that Ruth, so Naomi recognizes that there is something not right still,
[440.98 → 446.00] that she needs to find Banach for her daughter-in-law.
[446.88 → 448.94] And so I want you to recognize here, though, with me,
[449.44 → 456.72] that there is so much courage behind Naomi initiating and pursuing redemption for her daughter-in-law.
[457.28 → 465.98] To seek Banach for Ruth, it could potentially have very, very negative consequences for Naomi herself.
[465.98 → 472.00] We know, obviously, if you read the story and if you remember from last week,
[472.10 → 475.58] yes, we understand that Boaz was an honourable man, that there is hope there.
[476.38 → 480.68] But in the case, in the immediate context of Naomi and Ruth,
[481.02 → 485.98] it's not a safe and secure and confident way that she can approach this situation.
[486.36 → 490.12] There is so much potential for danger and for things to go wrong.
[490.12 → 494.20] Like, I mean, name it. Naomi could just go and marry another man.
[494.90 → 502.08] Just anybody, wealthy or not, she could have, you know, just met a man, and they got married
[502.08 → 504.68] and just leave Naomi to fend for herself.
[504.88 → 506.48] That is a total possibility.
[507.00 → 511.48] Or, worst case scenario, Ruth could have been taken advantage of.
[511.64 → 517.42] And we get the reference there in chapter 2 because Boaz had to tell his own men to not lay hands on Ruth.
[517.42 → 522.92] So there could have been terrible situations where Ruth could have been taken advantage of,
[523.10 → 529.34] pursuing this home, and both women could have been left devastated again.
[530.66 → 536.84] And so it is in this situation where Naomi proposes that Ruth go find the home.
[538.02 → 540.58] As I thought, you could be thinking, now, come on.
[541.16 → 546.84] Ruth and Naomi are now living back in the land of Israel among God's chosen holy people.
[546.84 → 553.62] God even made rules and laws to protect specifically the outcasts and the widows.
[554.00 → 556.36] The two widows that we have literally right here in this story.
[556.62 → 558.88] They should have been protected. Everything is right.
[560.08 → 564.58] But you have to realize this is a time at the end or during the time of Judges,
[564.68 → 566.18] before the monarchy period.
[566.72 → 570.42] And at the end of the book of Judges, we hear that there was no king,
[570.74 → 573.28] which is ironic because God is king.
[573.50 → 575.04] But they weren't acknowledging that, were they?
[575.04 → 579.86] There was no king, and everyone did as they saw fit.
[580.44 → 585.82] And in this context, there wasn't safety and security for these two widowed women.
[587.12 → 592.36] And so in the midst of turmoil and chaos, which Naomi describes in chapter 1,
[593.02 → 599.14] all these characters, all these people in this story are going through some sort of brokenness
[599.14 → 601.06] and heading toward redemption.
[601.06 → 609.10] And so I want to pause here for just a second and reflect on this idea or this concept of Ruth,
[609.42 → 613.40] or of Naomi, I should say, trying to seek redemption for her daughter-in-law,
[613.54 → 616.14] naming the brokenness, kind of provoking and saying,
[616.22 → 618.08] hey, we need to find you a home.
[618.16 → 619.20] We need to find you a husband.
[619.20 → 621.90] And so I want to ask right here,
[622.60 → 627.64] who are you a Naomi for in your life?
[628.86 → 631.40] How are you a Naomi for someone in your life?
[631.70 → 637.10] Do you know anybody in your circle of relationships that you know need healing?
[638.20 → 640.38] And the question is, have you provoked them lately?
[640.80 → 645.70] Have you poked at their pain and have journeyed with them to seek that healing?
[645.70 → 648.14] Just like what Naomi is doing.
[650.26 → 652.26] And so we turn to Ruth now.
[652.40 → 658.82] How does Ruth respond to her mother-in-law's request or plan of initiating this redemption?
[659.96 → 661.10] And not a surprise.
[661.42 → 666.96] Ruth, in continuance of our noble character that we see all throughout the story,
[667.50 → 671.04] Ruth is obedient and loyal to her mother-in-law.
[671.04 → 679.04] Now here, the details of what Naomi instructs Ruth to do is where there have been a lot of misconceptions.
[680.14 → 683.56] Some who read this carefully, this part of the story carefully,
[684.26 → 691.40] come to the assumption that Ruth engaged in sex with Boaz in order to secure her status to become his wife.
[692.10 → 696.24] So some say that there was some sort of weird prostitution at play here.
[696.24 → 705.86] And when you read the text, you'd either have to be very ignorant or just maybe a little too shy to name the sexual nuance that's embedded in the narrative itself.
[706.14 → 707.04] It is there.
[707.50 → 708.58] But what does it mean?
[709.86 → 714.66] The tension is high in a risky, potentially dangerous situation.
[714.66 → 716.40] And that much we need to understand.
[716.66 → 723.64] That this is not just some lovey-dovey love story where Ruth goes out and extends her feelings for Boaz,
[723.72 → 726.50] and then they come together, and they just get married.
[726.80 → 730.26] Oh, it's a happy, you know, they lived happily ever after story.
[730.48 → 732.34] It's not that case at all.
[732.76 → 735.24] It is a story full of tension.
[735.24 → 744.04] And the narrator is purposely building that tension for us through the story so that we can relate that there is potential danger here.
[745.38 → 748.52] And so here are the details of what Naomi instructs Ruth.
[748.96 → 753.16] Ruth approaches Boaz when he's alone, first.
[753.72 → 756.30] Before that, Naomi says, go get changed.
[756.48 → 758.38] Wash, go get changed, and put perfume on.
[758.38 → 765.54] Now, this all signifies, as I'm going to emphasize a little later, this signifies that this is a marriage proposal.
[766.60 → 777.40] That the way Ruth is now instructed to change clothes is to officially announce to everybody publicly that she is no longer in a state of mourning.
[778.06 → 778.36] Why?
[778.88 → 780.40] Because her husband passed away.
[781.40 → 781.54] Right?
[781.62 → 785.56] There are rituals and customs that you have to show that you are in a state of mourning.
[785.56 → 792.06] But now Naomi, her mother-in-law, is saying, you've got to show everybody that you are not, you're no longer mourning.
[792.28 → 794.20] That we're going to pursue redemption now.
[794.42 → 796.54] We're going to find you a true home.
[797.64 → 799.12] And so that's the beginning part.
[799.60 → 805.06] But then as she approaches Boaz when he's all alone, already it's a little sketchy.
[805.24 → 809.62] He's all alone on the threshing floor where they're winnowing barley.
[809.62 → 815.48] And as he drinks and has a good time and falls asleep, that's when Ruth approaches Boaz.
[816.00 → 821.90] And she says, and she apparently uncovers his feet and lies beside him.
[822.12 → 824.44] And when Boaz is startled, she continues.
[824.60 → 827.86] And she continues this proposal and says to Boaz,
[827.86 → 833.02] take the corner of your garment, your garment, and cover me.
[833.34 → 835.70] Because you are the guardian redeemer of our family.
[838.08 → 840.36] And so, hopefully you get the sense here.
[840.42 → 841.44] The tension is building.
[841.72 → 846.94] This is, there is potential for a lot of sin that could happen in this situation.
[847.28 → 850.98] As I said, the narrator is building the suspense to a peak.
[850.98 → 861.42] But what the important part is, is its one thing to recognize this tension building in this narrative way and find meaning in that.
[861.50 → 862.28] So that's one thing.
[862.86 → 869.98] But it's a totally different thing if we take our own Western, modern, hypersexualized lens,
[870.40 → 874.28] where sex is the pinnacle of all of human happiness or something.
[874.68 → 877.18] Take that lens and then read it into the text.
[877.60 → 879.90] And we assume that, oh, they must have had sex.
[879.90 → 884.96] That's to not do justice to the text that is presented for us.
[885.44 → 888.32] Again, you can't deny that there is tension.
[888.54 → 891.24] Yes, there is a lot of tension that's happening.
[891.72 → 896.18] But the meaning behind that is not the way we think.
[897.18 → 904.88] The overall context and the narrative tells us that it's not just some moral act of prostitution or self-gain.
[904.88 → 910.98] All of Ruth's actions can and should be interpreted as a marriage proposal.
[912.18 → 922.00] She's extending a request for Boaz, again in a risky situation, to answer his calling as a guardian redeemer, the goal of their family.
[922.00 → 926.00] Again, she's in a vulnerable situation.
[927.38 → 927.64] Why?
[927.64 → 931.28] Because Boaz could have flat out just rejected her.
[931.76 → 939.22] He wasn't obligated legally or in any way to have to fulfill his requirements as the goal, the guardian redeemer.
[939.92 → 949.30] Or again, worst case scenario, he could have taken advantage of this situation where they're alone and there's this foreigner that has no protection and rights.
[949.42 → 951.26] And he could have taken advantage of that.
[951.26 → 955.04] But we know how the story turns out.
[956.10 → 962.96] Both Ruth and Boaz act with integrity and honour here and throughout the story.
[964.54 → 974.34] And so one detail that I want to point out, especially in verse 9, where Ruth asks to spread the garment over her.
[975.08 → 978.48] This word for garment is the Hebrew word Knapp.
[978.66 → 980.56] And I want you to put that in your mind right now.
[980.56 → 982.22] Remember the word Knapp.
[983.14 → 989.54] Ruth asks Boaz, cover your Knapp over me because you are our goal, our guardian redeemer.
[990.88 → 999.52] This is referring to the actual prayer of blessing that Boaz prays over Ruth in the chapter before that we saw.
[999.52 → 1011.46] When Boaz finds out the loyalty and the loving kindness that Ruth has shown to her mother-in-law, Boaz approaches Ruth and prays over her a blessing saying,
[1012.10 → 1016.26] May the Lord repay you, Ruth, for what you have done for your mother-in-law.
[1016.26 → 1022.60] May you be richly rewarded by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings.
[1022.80 → 1024.70] And this is the same Hebrew word.
[1024.96 → 1029.08] Under whose Knapp you have come to take refuge.
[1030.22 → 1036.34] Under whose Knapp you have come to find a place of security and safety.
[1036.34 → 1044.10] And this prayer of blessing, Ruth is taking and asking Boaz himself to fulfill it.
[1045.92 → 1051.36] Just as you prayed for me, Boaz, just as you blessed me with the protection that the Lord can provide,
[1051.64 → 1056.42] that only the Lord can provide, I want you to fulfill that blessing.
[1056.42 → 1061.52] Be the instrument of God to fulfill that plan of redemption for our lives.
[1061.74 → 1069.98] Because Ruth and Naomi, they're in a state of brokenness where they've lost their loved ones.
[1072.90 → 1076.30] And so what is Boaz's response?
[1077.16 → 1078.46] How does he respond?
[1080.46 → 1084.82] Boaz, being the man of honour and noble character,
[1084.82 → 1088.76] he promises that very redemption that is asked.
[1089.20 → 1095.98] And even has the integrity to settle later on the matter with a closer relative
[1095.98 → 1100.88] who would be the actual legal official guardian redeemer of Naomi's family.
[1102.48 → 1107.78] Now that's not the response you would think if this was really just about sex.
[1108.68 → 1114.78] If Ruth is initiating some sort of sexual immoral act to seal her security,
[1114.82 → 1120.40] security with this man, that's not the response you would imagine that Boaz would respond with.
[1121.26 → 1123.42] Okay, Ruth, I get your request.
[1123.84 → 1127.82] I get that you're making a marriage proposal in this risky situation because
[1127.82 → 1131.50] you and Naomi are in need of a home.
[1132.20 → 1133.52] Now I'm going to pursue that.
[1133.52 → 1140.04] But, legally speaking, there's somebody closer in your family tree that has to be the goal first.
[1140.68 → 1142.06] If he rejects that,
[1142.74 → 1146.66] by God's name I will pursue that redemption and I will fulfill it.
[1146.88 → 1149.74] I will not rest until that redemption happens.
[1149.74 → 1156.66] That's the love of God expressed through Boaz to these two widowed women.
[1156.66 → 1165.58] Now I have to pause here because I had to wrestle with one part of the text that was a little bit confusing to me as well.
[1166.10 → 1167.96] When we get to verse 14 though,
[1169.12 → 1172.88] Boaz promises this plan of redemption and that he will fulfill it.
[1172.88 → 1178.98] But then he says, stay here for the night and go before anyone else wakes up and recognizes us.
[1178.98 → 1181.30] Why the secrecy?
[1182.14 → 1186.96] If these two characters are people of honour and integrity as we have seen,
[1187.28 → 1188.28] why the secrecy?
[1188.56 → 1190.80] Why do they have to keep this secret from everybody else?
[1192.06 → 1198.00] Again, for me, I had to wrestle with deconstructing my own western modern lens
[1198.00 → 1203.50] and try to see this in the view of the honour-shame culture of ancient Israel at the time.
[1204.92 → 1208.08] Boaz, being the man of honour and noble character,
[1208.08 → 1213.04] would have wanted to keep others from thinking shamefully
[1213.04 → 1216.86] and also spreading false rumours against Ruth.
[1218.16 → 1222.68] This kind of reminded me of how Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus,
[1223.28 → 1228.00] had wanted to secretly divorce Mary so that she wouldn't have to face public disgrace.
[1228.38 → 1229.46] It's an act of love.
[1229.76 → 1230.96] It's an act of caring.
[1232.30 → 1234.74] And this connection is interesting, isn't it?
[1234.74 → 1240.72] Both these men of honour paved the way for the anointed of God to be born.
[1241.06 → 1246.86] King David, for Boaz, and later on for Mary, King Jesus himself, our Redeemer,
[1247.50 → 1249.68] paving the way for that redemption to happen.
[1251.34 → 1255.26] And so, in other words, to kind of sum up this little section,
[1255.26 → 1259.86] in the midst of a sexually charged setting that you're supposed to read,
[1260.22 → 1266.50] both Boaz and Ruth live out their honour and integrity through their words and actions.
[1268.16 → 1273.58] They were a couple that represented the love of God through their honour and integrity.
[1273.58 → 1275.96] And it just kind of makes you think,
[1276.40 → 1281.10] what a beautiful, encouraging blessing that we want to bless our young couples with.
[1282.32 → 1288.04] To stay honourable and have the integrity to stay faithful.
[1291.04 → 1295.34] And so, the last part of the interaction between Boaz and Ruth.
[1295.70 → 1300.80] Boaz sends Ruth back with a symbolic act in responding to this marriage proposal.
[1300.80 → 1301.78] What does he do?
[1302.72 → 1305.34] He sends Ruth away, again, with provisions.
[1305.86 → 1307.84] Six measures of barley, we are told.
[1310.44 → 1314.38] Now, we don't know exactly how big of a provision this is,
[1314.44 → 1316.84] but the important part is this is a symbolic act.
[1317.22 → 1321.12] And he sends her back, and when Ruth reports back to Naomi what happened
[1321.12 → 1322.82] and everything that Boaz did for her,
[1323.28 → 1325.48] she quotes Boaz as saying to Ruth,
[1325.80 → 1328.76] I'm not going to let you go back to your mother-in-law empty.
[1328.76 → 1333.96] And the Hebrew word, yes, in our NIV it's translated empty-handed,
[1334.34 → 1336.16] but the Hebrew word is Reich,
[1336.58 → 1339.54] which is the same exact word that is used in chapter 1
[1339.54 → 1343.92] when Naomi laments that God brought her back to Israel,
[1344.76 → 1345.78] Reich, empty.
[1346.76 → 1347.58] Do you see the reversal?
[1348.62 → 1352.22] Through the act of redemption and honour and integrity of Boaz, their redeemer,
[1352.22 → 1356.48] now Ruth is sent back with a symbolic answer,
[1356.76 → 1359.42] a response with six measures of barley,
[1359.76 → 1362.90] saying we will no longer be empty now.
[1363.20 → 1366.52] God will provide through this redeemer, Boaz.
[1367.36 → 1369.06] He is the Jesus figure.
[1370.00 → 1375.20] He is the redeemer that reflects God's love and kindness
[1375.20 → 1378.50] and redemption for these two little women.
[1380.98 → 1383.52] And so the question for us today is this.
[1384.74 → 1388.00] Just as God worked his plan through Boaz and Ruth,
[1389.00 → 1392.88] does God use even people like us,
[1393.00 → 1394.80] even broken people like us,
[1395.48 → 1399.58] to fulfill his plan of redemption for the world?
[1399.58 → 1404.54] Through our own acts of honour and integrity,
[1405.04 → 1408.98] how does God use us even when we come short?
[1410.64 → 1414.06] We have our own temptations, our own addictions,
[1414.42 → 1417.00] our situations were taking the easy way out
[1417.00 → 1418.86] is kind of the normal culture
[1418.86 → 1422.36] and the standard that we are kind of tempted to always take.
[1422.62 → 1424.06] Cut the corners, that's fine.
[1425.68 → 1429.22] But as people of God, and like Boaz and Ruth,
[1429.58 → 1432.22] what kind of life and identity are we called to?
[1432.82 → 1433.92] Yes, we come up short,
[1434.54 → 1436.04] but that doesn't change the fact
[1436.04 → 1439.02] that we are called to a life of honour and integrity,
[1439.20 → 1441.02] to reflect God's goodness,
[1441.34 → 1444.26] his honour and his truthfulness and faithfulness
[1444.26 → 1445.26] and his integrity.
[1445.74 → 1448.72] Because Jesus came into our broken world,
[1449.20 → 1450.94] he humbled himself,
[1451.28 → 1454.52] and he took on flesh, our own humanness,
[1455.30 → 1458.70] and was tempted like we are constantly
[1458.70 → 1461.48] but he stayed true.
[1462.16 → 1463.74] He was without sin,
[1464.22 → 1465.68] as the book of Hebrews tells us.
[1466.12 → 1467.92] Tempted in every way like we are
[1467.92 → 1469.78] but was without sin.
[1470.18 → 1472.32] A man, a true human being
[1472.32 → 1474.06] of honour and integrity.
[1475.94 → 1477.90] And so even though we're not perfect,
[1478.16 → 1479.32] even if we come up short
[1479.32 → 1480.96] and we mess up constantly,
[1481.44 → 1483.98] God uses the brokenness and the mess
[1483.98 → 1486.26] to fulfill his plan of redemption.
[1487.52 → 1489.44] Now even in the story of Ruth,
[1489.50 → 1490.34] it's not perfect.
[1490.78 → 1492.56] I'm kind of portraying these three characters
[1492.56 → 1495.76] as if they're like super perfect holy people of God.
[1496.78 → 1500.20] They, and the context of the story is not perfect.
[1500.76 → 1502.08] As I've said before,
[1502.56 → 1504.26] their situation during a famine,
[1505.14 → 1506.56] the loss of loved ones,
[1506.72 → 1507.54] three husbands,
[1507.54 → 1510.32] and all the brokenness that comes
[1510.32 → 1511.90] with being a foreigner in Israel
[1511.90 → 1513.86] when it was supposed to be
[1513.86 → 1516.32] a safe environment
[1516.32 → 1518.50] where people came to see the light of God,
[1518.60 → 1521.10] the love of God expressed through his people.
[1521.44 → 1523.14] No, Boaz had to warn
[1523.14 → 1524.58] and tell his own men
[1524.58 → 1526.28] to not lay hands on a foreign woman.
[1527.28 → 1530.44] In the midst of not a perfect world,
[1531.42 → 1534.70] God uses an ordinary man, Boaz,
[1534.70 → 1537.32] and two ordinary women, Ruth and Naomi,
[1537.82 → 1541.12] to fulfill an extraordinary plan of redemption
[1541.12 → 1542.32] for the whole world,
[1542.62 → 1544.06] paving the way for King David
[1544.06 → 1546.44] and eventually our Lord Jesus Christ
[1546.44 → 1548.36] to be born in the genealogy
[1548.36 → 1550.54] of these foreign women,
[1551.40 → 1552.90] if you're including Tamar in this.
[1554.70 → 1556.30] So that's good news.
[1556.58 → 1557.94] That's good news for us.
[1558.46 → 1561.70] Like the psalmist professes in Psalm 91,
[1562.26 → 1563.16] similar idea.
[1563.16 → 1565.08] He prays,
[1565.28 → 1567.82] whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High
[1567.82 → 1570.16] will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
[1570.58 → 1571.68] I will say to the Lord,
[1572.00 → 1574.48] He is my refuge and my fortress,
[1574.88 → 1576.90] my God in whom I trust,
[1577.28 → 1577.84] my home.
[1579.10 → 1580.40] Surely He will save you
[1580.40 → 1581.46] from the fowler's snare
[1581.46 → 1583.16] and from the deadly pestilence.
[1584.02 → 1585.90] He will cover you with His feathers
[1585.90 → 1588.76] and under His naff
[1588.76 → 1591.12] you will find refuge.
[1591.12 → 1594.32] His faithfulness will be your shield and rampart.
[1595.48 → 1597.42] That is our protection.
[1597.84 → 1601.08] That is our assurance from our loving God.
[1602.10 → 1603.30] And like this psalmist,
[1603.52 → 1604.38] as he professes,
[1605.00 → 1606.48] this chapter in the story of Ruth
[1606.48 → 1608.10] ends with a similar posture.
[1609.20 → 1610.92] After having witnessed and experienced
[1610.92 → 1613.32] the goodness of their Redeemer, Boaz,
[1613.96 → 1616.82] Naomi simply instructs Ruth to wait.
[1616.82 → 1618.94] Now just wait.
[1618.94 → 1620.52] And trust that our Redeemer
[1620.52 → 1622.56] will now go and fulfill His plan.
[1623.84 → 1625.32] And that's the last we hear
[1625.32 → 1628.20] straight from the mouth of Naomi
[1628.20 → 1629.24] for the rest of the story.
[1629.78 → 1630.08] Wait.
[1630.82 → 1632.04] Wait on our Redeemer.
[1633.96 → 1635.94] And this is what we're called to.
[1636.66 → 1639.50] As we participate in God's plan of redemption,
[1639.80 → 1641.38] even through our brokenness,
[1641.38 → 1644.10] we have the good news and assurance
[1644.10 → 1645.68] to just wait
[1645.68 → 1649.56] and trust that God will fulfill His plan.
[1650.04 → 1651.30] It is not our plan.
[1652.12 → 1653.32] You can do all you want.
[1653.78 → 1656.06] You can try to perfect the world
[1656.06 → 1657.88] with your own efforts as much as you want.
[1658.40 → 1659.60] But this is God's plan.
[1659.86 → 1661.50] And without Him, everything is meaningless.
[1661.84 → 1662.50] Whatever we do.
[1663.56 → 1664.60] And that's the call.
[1664.86 → 1666.82] You wait, and you trust in the Lord
[1666.82 → 1667.94] to fulfill His plan,
[1668.12 → 1670.48] even in the midst of our own brokenness.
[1670.48 → 1672.24] That's the good news.
[1672.50 → 1673.68] Through His Holy Spirit,
[1673.88 → 1675.02] we are now equipped.
[1675.54 → 1676.62] His Holy Spirit,
[1676.86 → 1677.66] not my spirit,
[1677.92 → 1680.10] not my own ingenuity and efforts.
[1681.88 → 1684.60] His Holy Spirit equipping all of my efforts
[1684.60 → 1687.26] to fulfill and bring His kingdom here.
[1689.44 → 1692.70] With this confidence in our Redeemer, Jesus Christ,
[1693.56 → 1695.72] we are equipped and sent
[1695.72 → 1697.84] to be a blessing for the world,
[1697.90 → 1698.66] as we keep saying,
[1698.66 → 1703.12] even through our own deeds of honour and integrity,
[1703.44 → 1705.06] whatever that may look like in your lives.
[1705.56 → 1708.04] Even through the tiny, ordinary acts,
[1708.58 → 1709.84] God uses that
[1709.84 → 1713.50] for His extraordinary act of redemption for the world.
[1714.64 → 1715.50] God is good.
[1715.58 → 1715.70] Amen?
[1716.70 → 1717.18] Amen.
[1717.40 → 1717.88] Let's pray.
[1717.88 → 1717.96] Amen.
[1717.96 → 1718.58] Amen.
[1725.34 → 1725.88] Loving Father,
[1726.08 → 1728.24] we come before You again as Your people.
[1729.26 → 1732.46] We come before You with gratitude and humility
[1732.46 → 1733.22] because, Lord,
[1734.06 → 1736.56] we are broken, and we come short in so many ways.
[1736.56 → 1742.98] I ask that you bless us, and you equip us to be able to name that brokenness for one another,
[1743.46 → 1746.34] to journey together toward a path of healing.
[1747.32 → 1754.40] That Lord, as we do, the world around us will see this healing journey that we're on,
[1755.02 → 1757.32] this plan of redemption that we participate in,
[1757.70 → 1761.56] through our ordinary acts of kindness, our honour and integrity,
[1761.56 → 1769.10] that we would reflect even just a little bit of your goodness for the world and those around us in our lives.
[1769.86 → 1772.50] So we thank you for using people even like us.
[1773.76 → 1779.28] Continue to encourage and strengthen us, Lord, as we live out our identity and our calling.
[1779.94 → 1781.74] In Jesus' name, amen.
[1783.32 → 1784.36] I invite you to...
