[0.00 --> 3.52]  when the youth were up here is that they went for a whole week without phones.
[4.42 --> 7.76]  And the parents said, you know, it can be done there, but it can also be done here.
[7.88 --> 9.56]  So just a note there.
[10.14 --> 11.98]  But I want to say to the youth, thank you for what you shared.
[12.86 --> 16.72]  It is encouraging to know that you came with a posture of humility to learn, to listen,
[16.96 --> 18.18]  and to serve with humility.
[19.42 --> 22.58]  We're going to keep reflecting, actually, on what it means to be part of God's global body.
[23.00 --> 27.10]  And I'm going to do that by inviting us to read together the words of 1 Corinthians 12
[27.10 --> 28.38]  on being the body of Christ.
[28.38 --> 32.42]  So if you have your Bible, turn with me to 1 Corinthians 12, and we're going to read
[32.42 --> 34.02]  12 to 27.
[38.66 --> 45.56]  Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its parts form one body, so it is with
[45.56 --> 45.92]  Christ.
[46.84 --> 52.40]  For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body, whether Jews or Gentiles,
[52.54 --> 56.06]  slave or free, and we were given one Spirit to drink.
[56.06 --> 59.56]  Even so, the body is not made up of one part, but of many.
[60.56 --> 65.16]  Now, if the foot should say, because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body, it would
[65.16 --> 67.34]  not for that reason cease to be part of the body.
[67.92 --> 72.32]  And if the ear should say, because I'm not an ear, I do not belong to the body, it would
[72.32 --> 74.60]  not for that reason cease to be part of the body.
[75.36 --> 78.90]  If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be?
[78.90 --> 82.26]  If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
[82.92 --> 88.06]  But in fact, God has placed the parts of the body, every one of them, just as he wanted
[88.06 --> 88.64]  them to be.
[89.24 --> 91.64]  If they were all one part, where would the body be?
[92.30 --> 94.96]  As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
[95.98 --> 98.60]  The eye cannot say to the hand, I don't need you.
[99.14 --> 101.38]  And the head cannot say to the feet, I don't need you.
[101.38 --> 107.34]  On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and the
[107.34 --> 111.12]  parts that we think are less honorable, we treat with special honor.
[111.88 --> 116.58]  The parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, while our presentable
[116.58 --> 118.42]  parts need no special treatment.
[119.26 --> 123.24]  But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it, so
[123.24 --> 128.02]  that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern
[128.02 --> 128.76]  for each other.
[128.76 --> 133.04]  If one part suffers, every part suffers with it.
[133.40 --> 137.18]  If one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
[137.76 --> 142.30]  Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is part of it.
[146.10 --> 150.82]  Well, a number of years ago, I remember being a youth pastor and leading serve teams down
[150.82 --> 151.50]  to Honduras.
[151.60 --> 155.16]  In fact, this morning, we have some Hondurans in our church, and it was a delight to sort of
[155.16 --> 157.10]  connect and build that relationship.
[157.10 --> 162.02]  But when we led these serve teams, we did this preparation and orientation for the trip,
[162.16 --> 166.66]  and we'd read this book by David Livingston called Serving with Eyes Wide Open.
[167.22 --> 171.94]  And in that book, he opened up how when, generally speaking, North American Christians go on serve
[171.94 --> 175.00]  trips, they have a mentality about what they're supposed to do, the kind of questions they have
[175.00 --> 175.44]  to ask.
[175.44 --> 179.54]  And there's a pragmatism, like practical questions, like we have this much money to fundraise,
[179.74 --> 182.74]  this is the job, these are the things we need to do before we get there, these are the goals
[182.74 --> 183.58]  we have for the trip.
[184.38 --> 188.54]  And David Livingston kept saying, you know, we want to ask more questions than just those.
[189.06 --> 193.50]  And some of the questions that we want to ask are, what is it that we have to learn when
[193.50 --> 193.92]  we go?
[193.92 --> 199.54]  What is it that the body of Christ in that place, in that city, in that town, has to teach
[199.54 --> 204.64]  us as Western believers about our faith, about how we read the Bible, about how we follow Jesus
[204.64 --> 205.80]  faithfully in our culture?
[206.42 --> 211.70]  And his main point was, you don't just go to serve, as important as that is, you go to
[211.70 --> 212.12]  learn.
[212.98 --> 217.72]  You go with the posture of a humble listener so that you can receive the gift that the body
[217.72 --> 219.68]  of Christ in that place is to you.
[219.68 --> 225.98]  Now, when we read a passage like 1 Corinthians 12, probably well-known words to some of us
[225.98 --> 229.36]  on what it means to be the body of Christ, we often think of the local church.
[230.02 --> 232.10]  And we hear these words as important words, right?
[232.16 --> 236.94]  We're a diverse family with diverse gifts from diverse places, and God brings us into the
[236.94 --> 242.08]  body of Jesus as a unified body to serve and grow and build ourselves up in his love
[242.08 --> 242.76]  and his grace.
[243.60 --> 248.48]  And the two concerns of this passage, the first is, in the first half of the passage, is you
[248.48 --> 250.26]  cannot think that you are not needed.
[250.88 --> 253.00]  Because you are not something else doesn't mean you don't belong.
[253.14 --> 254.46]  You belong to the body of Christ.
[254.72 --> 259.74]  And the second concern that Paul has is, because someone else is not like you, you cannot say
[259.74 --> 261.10]  to them they do not belong.
[261.72 --> 266.50]  Their gifts, their abilities, their personhood matters in the body of Christ.
[266.62 --> 267.14]  They belong.
[267.92 --> 270.78]  And I want to suggest that this is not just true on a local level.
[270.90 --> 272.08]  This is true on a global level.
[272.62 --> 274.78]  This is not just true of a local church like here at Hope.
[274.78 --> 277.36]  It's true of the body of Christ around the world.
[277.44 --> 281.84]  And whether you know it or not, whether you focus on it or not, we are part of a global
[281.84 --> 282.92]  body.
[283.78 --> 286.90]  Our brothers and sisters span the world.
[286.90 --> 293.20]  Now, when Paul is writing to the church in Corinth, he's writing to a time, or writing to a church
[293.20 --> 295.04]  at a time when this church was actually quite small.
[295.28 --> 296.46]  I mean, just try to imagine this.
[297.18 --> 300.62]  When they're writing some of these letters, they would say, this is a letter I want you
[300.62 --> 301.66]  to read to this body.
[301.76 --> 304.26]  And I want you to then send that letter over to the church in Philippi.
[304.34 --> 305.28]  They're going to read it to their church.
[305.42 --> 307.16]  Then send it over to Galatia.
[307.30 --> 308.16]  And then send it back.
[308.24 --> 310.64]  Like, the church was so small, they could send the letters to each other.
[310.76 --> 311.58]  And they were it.
[311.58 --> 316.22]  But already then, Paul, when he wrote to Corinth and other letters to the church, he wanted
[316.22 --> 320.56]  the believers to know that you don't just belong to the church in this city, in this
[320.56 --> 320.80]  place.
[320.88 --> 322.58]  You belong to the church.
[323.54 --> 327.82]  He says in his greeting to the Corinthian church, grace and peace to you, believers in
[327.82 --> 333.00]  this city, along with those everywhere who call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[333.12 --> 336.10]  There's that sense of you all belong to the same family.
[336.74 --> 338.56]  You are one body.
[338.56 --> 343.82]  It's a beautiful thing to think that we're part of a wider body.
[343.92 --> 348.46]  And if you were there, by the way, last Friday at a Good Friday service, you would have gotten
[348.46 --> 352.52]  the rich experience of worshiping with all these different churches, even our own city,
[352.70 --> 356.40]  different denominations, different parts of our city, coming together, 700 people to
[356.40 --> 358.12]  say, Jesus Christ is Lord.
[358.68 --> 360.20]  He's finished the work on the cross.
[360.54 --> 364.12]  And we got to have our Pentecostal brothers and sisters teach us how to worship, right?
[364.36 --> 366.00]  How our bodies move when we sing.
[366.00 --> 370.82]  And I could tell that even Craig Miller, the pastor there, he preached in a wonderfully
[370.82 --> 371.60]  Pentecostal way.
[371.68 --> 373.20]  And I thought, man, I wish I could preach like Craig.
[373.34 --> 375.68]  That's the gift of being with the wider body of Christ.
[377.46 --> 382.56]  I want to show us a map that's going to give you a sense of how wide the body of Christ
[382.56 --> 382.88]  is.
[382.98 --> 387.42]  Because as we worship, even this morning, all night while you slept, the body of Christ
[387.42 --> 388.12]  has been worshiping.
[388.64 --> 390.38]  Now, this is a map of world Christianity.
[390.56 --> 391.58]  It's already three years old.
[391.58 --> 394.98]  And there's so much I could say about it, but just notice a couple things.
[395.88 --> 401.76]  Notice that we have 667 million brothers and sisters on the continent of Africa.
[402.06 --> 403.02]  Just take that number in.
[403.48 --> 407.62]  We have 612 million brothers and sisters in Latin America.
[408.52 --> 412.96]  And I think one of the most surprising things that church historians would say is that we
[412.96 --> 416.02]  have 379 million brothers and sisters in Asia.
[416.72 --> 418.72]  Praise the Lord for his global body.
[418.72 --> 424.26]  Notice also, as you look at North America, where's the smallest church?
[424.42 --> 428.38]  Well, other than Oceania, but look at how small we are compared to the southern churches.
[428.78 --> 429.10]  268.
[429.18 --> 429.96]  Praise the Lord for it.
[430.18 --> 432.98]  But notice that we are one of the smaller parts of the body of Christ.
[434.04 --> 436.40]  Last thing to point out on this map, 1900.
[436.54 --> 437.00]  See on the bottom?
[437.12 --> 437.52]  1900.
[437.74 --> 440.10]  82% of the church was in the northern hemisphere.
[440.56 --> 441.74]  18% in the south.
[442.10 --> 442.50]  2020.
[443.06 --> 444.70]  33% in the northern hemisphere.
[444.92 --> 447.30]  67% in the south.
[447.30 --> 449.22]  Isn't that staggering?
[450.14 --> 452.18]  We are the body of Christ.
[452.76 --> 455.70]  And you have brothers and sisters that have worshipped in Taiwan already.
[455.86 --> 458.70]  You have brothers and sisters that have worshipped in Ghana already.
[458.82 --> 462.82]  And we are now the last group, really, of the world to gather for worship on Sunday morning.
[462.88 --> 464.68]  But this is our global family.
[465.82 --> 467.20]  Let me ask you a question now.
[467.20 --> 475.28]  When is the last time you sat down with someone from a different part of the world and asked them about how they practiced their faith?
[475.76 --> 477.16]  How their church lived out the gospel?
[477.28 --> 478.26]  How they did evangelism?
[478.40 --> 483.04]  In such a way that you are actually learning from your brothers and sisters in other parts of the world.
[483.72 --> 491.14]  When is the last time you said, hey, I feel like as a western Christian I have something to learn from this global body that God has grafted me into?
[492.14 --> 493.26]  That's an important question.
[493.36 --> 497.90]  I want you to take it into your small groups because this is really what we want to focus our attention on this morning.
[499.46 --> 503.14]  A few years ago now, I listened to a talk by a Kenyan missiologist.
[503.82 --> 508.64]  That is a person who studies mission around the world, how the gospel is going out and how the global church is changing.
[509.14 --> 510.30]  His name is Oscar Miri.
[510.88 --> 513.64]  And Oscar Miri was talking at this conference at Urbana.
[513.76 --> 515.74]  It's one of the biggest mission conferences in the States.
[515.74 --> 521.72]  And he talked about the global church, the shifts that have taken place, the implications it has for Christians in every country.
[522.16 --> 523.82]  And he made this joke that's always stuck with me.
[523.88 --> 528.84]  He said, you know, as we think about the body of Christ, imagine the body of Christ was European.
[529.84 --> 531.50]  Where would the sense of joy be?
[532.90 --> 537.18]  And then he said, but if the whole body of Christ was African, where would the sense of time be?
[538.20 --> 541.58]  And as people were laughing, he then gave them some very hard information.
[541.68 --> 542.32]  I'm going to share it with you.
[542.36 --> 543.68]  Once you hear this, you can't unhear it.
[543.68 --> 545.68]  So I want you to wrestle with me with what he shared next.
[545.76 --> 550.88]  He said, the last hundred years or so, the church in the West has been in decline.
[551.62 --> 552.30]  It's been shrinking.
[553.22 --> 564.56]  And at the same time, in the last hundred years, the churches in Asia, Latin America, and Africa have been growing and thriving in spite of very challenging circumstances.
[564.88 --> 569.14]  Persecution, poverty, challenges socioeconomically.
[569.54 --> 572.32]  And yet they found a way to grow, to plant.
[572.32 --> 584.28]  In fact, one church in Kenya, Oscar Miri's church, their vision, just to take this in, they wanted to plant churches in the very cities where back like 50, 70 years ago, cities in North America planted there.
[584.34 --> 587.94]  And they wanted to plant churches back in those cities because the churches were dying in them.
[588.62 --> 592.08]  It's almost replanting to the city that planted a church in your country.
[592.62 --> 593.80]  And I say, praise the Lord for that.
[593.80 --> 603.62]  The next thing he said was, not only is the church in North America and the West shrinking, it's also known around the world by other Christians as being compromised.
[604.36 --> 610.90]  That the idols of Western society, materialism, prosperity, individualism, they're sort of seeping in destructive ways into the church.
[610.90 --> 614.32]  And so you've got this reality, and this is how he frames it.
[614.58 --> 617.62]  You've got a Western church that's compromised by its culture.
[618.32 --> 622.78]  That's planting churches all around the world and for hundreds of years have said to those churches and those Christians,
[623.18 --> 626.74]  here's how you should read the Bible, here's how you should plant churches, here's how you do evangelism.
[626.86 --> 628.30]  But now the Western church is shrinking.
[628.42 --> 629.86]  And here's the key question he asked.
[629.86 --> 636.16]  In this time, while the global church grows and learns to thrive, even in the midst of challenging circumstances,
[636.34 --> 646.14]  and the Western church shrinks, do Western believers have the humility to hear and learn from their brothers and sisters around the world about the gospel?
[646.84 --> 655.88]  How they preach it, how they teach it, how they share the gospel, how they live and suffer and take very serious considerations about how to be faithful in trying circumstances.
[655.88 --> 665.64]  Do Western believers have the ability to say, I might not have it right, and it's actually time for me to listen to the global church about how to be the church?
[666.98 --> 675.56]  Or to put it differently, what Oscar Miri was asking is, does the Western church implicitly say to its brothers and sisters in all sorts of parts of the world,
[676.12 --> 678.16]  I don't need you?
[679.44 --> 682.96]  Saying, I've got what it takes on our own, we can figure this out just in our own culture.
[682.96 --> 688.60]  We don't need the voices, the critique, and the thoughts, and the desires, and the wisdom of God's global body.
[689.38 --> 691.92]  And I'll read for us again as we think about the global church.
[692.40 --> 694.94]  Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 12, starting in 21.
[695.62 --> 698.52]  The eye cannot say to the hand, I don't need you.
[699.02 --> 701.28]  And the head cannot say to the feet, I don't need you.
[701.86 --> 706.78]  On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable.
[707.62 --> 711.16]  And the parts that we think are less honorable, we treat with special honor.
[711.16 --> 715.98]  And the parts that are unpresentable, we treat with special modesty.
[717.42 --> 718.36]  What a challenge.
[720.18 --> 723.08]  Now, this week as I was writing my sermon, I actually felt convicted.
[723.48 --> 727.66]  And I felt convicted to reach out to believers in our church who grew up in other parts of the world,
[727.80 --> 730.94]  and believers in our community that I know who grew up in other churches around the world,
[731.08 --> 732.16]  and I asked them two questions.
[732.48 --> 733.90]  Okay, here are the two questions I asked them.
[734.20 --> 737.62]  And thank you to those of you who were here this morning who answered them and called me and talked with me.
[737.62 --> 744.98]  The questions I asked were, number one, what do you think believers in Canada need to learn from the church in the place where you grew up?
[745.90 --> 747.28]  Second question was the opposite.
[747.50 --> 751.66]  What is it that you think the church where you grew up, whether it be Nigeria, here's the places I asked,
[751.72 --> 759.48]  Nigeria, Ghana, Korea, South Africa, Honduras, and Brazil, and one more, Mexico.
[760.24 --> 765.44]  And the second question was, what does the church in that place where you grew up need to learn from the church of Jesus Christ here in Canada?
[765.54 --> 766.60]  Do you want to know what they said?
[767.96 --> 768.98]  Well, you're going to hear it either way.
[770.96 --> 774.46]  And thoughtfully, many of them, you know, very kindly, because some of them are quite new to Canada,
[774.56 --> 778.32]  they said, well, let me tell you what we love about the church in Canada first that I think my home church has to learn from.
[778.38 --> 781.56]  So this is me condensing and summarizing a lot of different feedback.
[781.76 --> 782.28]  So here we go.
[782.28 --> 786.30]  Number one, something that I actually heard from a few different people from different churches, they said,
[786.60 --> 789.38]  one of the things they like about the Canadian church is this transparency.
[790.36 --> 794.52]  Leaders are open about their ambitions, they're open about their plans, they're open about their finances,
[794.84 --> 798.18]  and there's a sense in which you can ask questions, you can challenge decisions,
[798.32 --> 801.50]  you have a say as a believer in your church, and leaders have some accountability.
[802.34 --> 806.84]  In fact, related to that, a comment I heard from two different people, particularly African churches,
[807.10 --> 809.06]  was that pastors are accountable.
[809.34 --> 812.06]  We can't just do whatever we want, we can't just fundraise for whatever we want,
[812.48 --> 817.66]  you know, one of our elders, Joe, he said, you know, in Africa, it's not uncommon for a pastor to fundraise for a jet.
[818.20 --> 820.72]  I was like, that sounds amazing, we should try this.
[821.60 --> 822.92]  I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
[823.38 --> 827.04]  And he likes the fact that in Canada, pastors are accountable to the body of elders,
[827.16 --> 830.14]  and you can't just do whatever you want, there's a limit to your leadership,
[830.14 --> 832.28]  and accountability to your ambitions in a church.
[832.32 --> 833.26]  And he said, that's a gift.
[834.32 --> 839.20]  In addition to that, a number of people said one of the things they appreciate about the church of Jesus in Canada
[839.20 --> 843.88]  is his generosity, which, interesting, was mentioned about the church in Mexico as well.
[844.42 --> 847.22]  That there's a section where Canadians want to give their money to where the needs are.
[847.42 --> 848.98]  They don't want to have strings attached, they want to be generous.
[849.16 --> 853.10]  And more than that, someone said, this church in particular, and this encourages me,
[853.22 --> 854.82]  they said, this church wants to serve its neighborhood.
[855.40 --> 860.22]  They don't just want to gather from parts of the city and be a little isolated place in this community.
[860.22 --> 865.10]  They want to actually be known, care for, and involved in the places of need in Clayton Heights.
[865.20 --> 867.80]  And take that encouragement from people who are new to our own church.
[869.10 --> 870.54]  So those are some of the encouragements.
[870.66 --> 872.06]  Are you ready for some of the critiques?
[872.98 --> 875.32]  And just remember, if you're offended, I'm just the messenger.
[875.66 --> 878.58]  I'm just sharing with you what people shared with me.
[879.76 --> 880.80]  All right, here we go.
[880.80 --> 889.36]  Number one, the church of Jesus Christ in Nigeria has many things to teach the church of Jesus in Canada
[889.36 --> 894.74]  about the power and authority of God over his world and over people.
[895.22 --> 897.42]  That is to say, God has the power to heal.
[897.82 --> 899.64]  God has the power to give spiritual gifts.
[899.82 --> 901.80]  And we can expect him to give those things.
[902.54 --> 904.14]  We can ask him to give those things.
[904.62 --> 909.22]  And to add to that, I heard from Koreans, I heard from Nigerians, and from Ghanaians
[909.22 --> 913.64]  that prayer is not just an optional side part of the Christian life.
[913.72 --> 915.00]  It's not something you do when you have to.
[915.06 --> 918.36]  It's something you get to do because it has so much power.
[919.96 --> 924.50]  And we can ask God to do things, not only when we're at our last resort, but as a first resort.
[924.50 --> 930.64]  It's a joy to be the church because to ask our sovereign, powerful God to work in sovereign, powerful ways.
[931.88 --> 933.12]  One story on that.
[933.80 --> 937.48]  Years ago, when one of our serve teams went to Honduras, we were about to get on a bus.
[937.48 --> 941.40]  And before we got on this old bus, the pastor and the person who was leading the trip,
[941.64 --> 942.56]  they had to surround the bus.
[942.62 --> 946.36]  And the pastor places his hands on the bus and starts praying for the bus.
[946.82 --> 949.22]  Praying for the tires, praying for the motor, praying for the parts.
[949.60 --> 953.08]  And me, as a very Western Christian, I was like, what are we doing?
[953.14 --> 954.18]  We're praying for a motor.
[954.60 --> 958.24]  And in my mind, I'm like, how can you pray for a motor of a bus?
[958.32 --> 959.48]  That's what mechanics do.
[960.42 --> 961.42]  But let me ask you this.
[961.48 --> 964.14]  Does God have the power to keep a bus running?
[964.14 --> 967.40]  Absolutely, he does.
[967.82 --> 972.56]  And the pastor in Honduras said, we're getting on this bus till we pray because we need God
[972.56 --> 975.04]  to keep us safe as we do this journey to this other community.
[975.68 --> 980.16]  And this pastor right here had to learn, wow, I never have prayed in my life for a bus
[980.16 --> 981.08]  and I've got a lot to learn.
[982.72 --> 989.84]  The Church of Jesus Christ in Mexico and Brazil have much to teach us about what it means to
[989.84 --> 993.54]  be part of a church because we're not just individuals who believe the same thing, who
[993.54 --> 996.96]  just so happen to join together with other believers who believe the same thing when
[996.96 --> 997.72]  we feel convenient.
[998.32 --> 1002.26]  No, we actually belong to a family of Christ.
[1003.04 --> 1005.88]  We belong to brothers and sisters of our faith.
[1005.94 --> 1007.84]  And we have a responsibility to them.
[1008.06 --> 1009.54]  They have a responsibility to us.
[1009.74 --> 1011.40]  They're not an optional part of our life.
[1011.68 --> 1012.90]  They are our family.
[1012.90 --> 1012.98]  family.
[1013.30 --> 1015.22]  And we cannot neglect them.
[1015.80 --> 1020.58]  To skip church is not a thing that you think about in many parts of the world because that's
[1020.58 --> 1022.76]  leaving your family and you don't do that.
[1024.52 --> 1029.70]  The Church of Jesus Christ in Canada has much to learn from the church in South Africa and
[1029.70 --> 1035.80]  the church in the Philippines about being bold in our evangelism, about not being preoccupied
[1035.80 --> 1039.08]  with what people think about us, how they might view us differently because of who we believe
[1039.08 --> 1043.50]  in, but to share it trusting that what we have come to believe about Jesus is not just good
[1043.50 --> 1045.72]  news for us, but it's good news for them.
[1046.30 --> 1047.82]  And that evangelism is not an obligation.
[1047.98 --> 1052.26]  It's a privilege to tell people why it is that we believe in Jesus.
[1052.36 --> 1056.20]  We need to learn boldness from our brothers and sisters in the Philippines and Brazil.
[1057.74 --> 1062.40]  And just to summarize one that actually showed up in three different churches, Brazil, Mexico,
[1063.04 --> 1065.10]  and South Africa.
[1065.10 --> 1070.14]  They said, you know, Christians in Canada need to let go of their control over time.
[1071.18 --> 1076.34]  We need to learn how to be less busy and less like I have to do this many things in this
[1076.34 --> 1081.18]  much time and as a result neglect relationship and practice Sabbath.
[1081.88 --> 1084.86]  You know, it's a very well-known thing among Christians in other parts of the world that
[1084.86 --> 1090.66]  Western believers have a hard time actually stopping, eating meals together, gathering for
[1090.66 --> 1094.38]  worship, and having a whole day where you're just in relationship, enjoying God's world,
[1094.38 --> 1101.20]  enjoying relationships, enjoying just being without time constraints and tend-to-do items
[1101.20 --> 1101.94]  on your list.
[1103.38 --> 1110.76]  And finally, maybe most challengingly, the Church of Jesus Christ in Ghana has much to
[1110.76 --> 1115.34]  teach the church in Canada about the fact that your opinions and your emotions and your
[1115.34 --> 1118.86]  feelings do not trump what Jesus Christ says at His Word.
[1118.86 --> 1121.48]  You might feel something.
[1121.54 --> 1122.94]  You might have strong opinions on something.
[1123.08 --> 1127.40]  But it doesn't matter if you cannot show how this is something God has said to us as a way
[1127.40 --> 1128.40]  of living by His Word.
[1129.02 --> 1133.08]  And on the phone, the person I was talking with said, this is our job to find out what
[1133.08 --> 1137.80]  Jesus Christ in His Word has revealed to us about how we live our daily lives in every
[1137.80 --> 1138.20]  sphere.
[1138.20 --> 1143.82]  And we must obey and take it seriously even if we don't like it.
[1144.74 --> 1145.02]  Whew.
[1146.62 --> 1150.16]  I hope you're feeling what I feel this week as I listen to these comments.
[1150.22 --> 1151.56]  And these are just a few, by the way.
[1152.20 --> 1156.96]  But how much we have to learn from our global body of Christ.
[1157.54 --> 1160.58]  And what a failure it would be for us not to listen.
[1160.58 --> 1166.12]  The beautiful thing is that you don't have to get on a plane, you don't have to buy a
[1166.12 --> 1169.48]  ticket, you don't have to travel to the furthest points of our world to listen and learn and
[1169.48 --> 1170.38]  grow with the body of Christ.
[1170.50 --> 1170.98]  Get this.
[1171.04 --> 1171.62]  Are you ready for this?
[1171.82 --> 1173.26]  You can grab a coffee in the foyer.
[1174.20 --> 1180.38]  You can talk to someone after our service from Taiwan, Brazil, Mexico, Honduras, Nigeria,
[1180.96 --> 1182.88]  Ghana, South Africa, and beyond.
[1183.00 --> 1188.82]  You can simply ask someone in your own church, tell me, how do you think the Canadian church
[1188.82 --> 1192.06]  can grow and learn from the body of Christ in the country you grew up?
[1193.22 --> 1196.40]  I just invite you now to think about who to talk to after the service.
[1197.18 --> 1198.00]  And take time to learn.
[1198.14 --> 1198.70]  Take time to listen.
[1198.86 --> 1202.96]  Recognize that the body of Christ, everyone brings gifts and we have much to learn from
[1202.96 --> 1204.66]  the gift of God's global body.
[1206.12 --> 1209.04]  Let me return finally to the why of this passage.
[1209.92 --> 1214.74]  Paul cares so much about how the diverse gifts of the body, the diverse people in the body of
[1214.74 --> 1216.22]  Christ are brought together in unity.
[1216.76 --> 1217.72]  He cares about that.
[1217.72 --> 1219.30]  I'm going to name three specific reasons.
[1219.44 --> 1221.90]  Number one, we need each other, okay?
[1222.12 --> 1223.58]  At a local level and a global level.
[1223.70 --> 1224.26]  We have gifts.
[1224.38 --> 1224.88]  We have ambitions.
[1225.12 --> 1228.98]  We have abilities that other people don't and they need us and vice versa.
[1229.52 --> 1230.22]  They have gifts.
[1230.32 --> 1230.94]  They have abilities.
[1231.04 --> 1231.64]  They have ambitions.
[1231.76 --> 1234.16]  They have wisdom that we need.
[1234.70 --> 1238.44]  And no one can say to anybody else, I'm not needed and that you are not needed.
[1238.54 --> 1239.66]  And that's true at a local level.
[1239.86 --> 1241.72]  That's true at a citywide level.
[1241.80 --> 1243.38]  That's true at a global level.
[1243.38 --> 1251.62]  But secondly, more challengingly, you and I have idols and cultural blind spots that we
[1251.62 --> 1252.50]  need to repent of.
[1253.04 --> 1255.60]  And we need our brothers and sisters around the world to help us see that.
[1256.88 --> 1257.70]  There is a proverb.
[1257.70 --> 1259.54]  I'm not sure if it's African or Chinese.
[1259.66 --> 1261.54]  So if someone can correct me on this after the service.
[1261.62 --> 1262.58]  But the proverb is this.
[1263.24 --> 1266.78]  If you want to know what the water is like, don't ask a fish.
[1266.84 --> 1267.50]  Have you heard that before?
[1268.52 --> 1272.58]  And the idea behind it is, you know, the fish is swimming in the water.
[1272.66 --> 1274.36]  They have no idea what the water is like.
[1274.38 --> 1275.14]  That's all they know.
[1275.70 --> 1279.64]  And so us Western Christians living in the Western fishbowl, we have no idea what kind
[1279.64 --> 1280.06]  of water it is.
[1280.08 --> 1280.68]  That's all we know.
[1280.88 --> 1285.56]  We need someone from a Taiwanese fishbowl coming into the Western fishbowl saying, whoa,
[1285.62 --> 1287.24]  whoa, this is toxic here.
[1287.50 --> 1289.08]  Do you know how dirty this water is?
[1289.20 --> 1291.00]  And they help us repent of our idols.
[1291.64 --> 1292.28]  It's a real thing.
[1293.06 --> 1297.40]  You know, Shin He, who plays bass up here, he moved to Canada from Korea about a year
[1297.40 --> 1298.62]  and a bit ago with his family.
[1298.90 --> 1303.74]  And he and I have been ongoing dialogue, debate, and argue partners for the last year.
[1303.74 --> 1307.66]  Because Shin He, moving from Korea, has all sorts of criticism of the Korean church.
[1307.74 --> 1309.14]  He loves being in the Canadian church.
[1309.42 --> 1312.62]  And I say to Shin He, Shin He, there's so many idols in the Canadian church.
[1312.80 --> 1314.14]  We need to learn from the Korean church.
[1314.32 --> 1315.42]  And he's definitely wrong.
[1315.92 --> 1316.82]  I'm definitely right.
[1317.40 --> 1318.74]  And we keep going back and forth.
[1318.82 --> 1322.78]  And what we're doing, though, is inviting each other into a posture of learning, of repentance,
[1323.12 --> 1323.74]  and growing.
[1324.24 --> 1328.22]  Because Shin He's got insight that I would never know until I talk to a Korean believer.
[1328.40 --> 1331.72]  And vice versa, he's learning from me all the challenges that come with growing up in Canada
[1331.72 --> 1333.94]  and all the challenges of being in the Canadian church.
[1335.06 --> 1339.66]  Your brothers and sisters in other parts of the world are one of the greatest gifts
[1339.66 --> 1342.24]  in your journey of repentance and faith.
[1342.38 --> 1343.26]  Receive that gift.
[1344.66 --> 1350.08]  Thirdly and finally, diversity brought into unity matters to Paul.
[1350.26 --> 1351.18]  Don't miss this.
[1351.50 --> 1354.88]  Because it proves and illustrates the power of the resurrection.
[1355.68 --> 1355.82]  Okay?
[1356.24 --> 1357.00]  Think about this.
[1357.00 --> 1361.66]  Paul sees that when Jews and Gentiles slave and free, which he mentions in our passage,
[1361.96 --> 1366.38]  when they come together in a family, it proves the power of what Jesus has done.
[1366.60 --> 1370.62]  Because the power of the cross reconciled people who were once enemies.
[1371.18 --> 1375.54]  People who once defined themselves by their cultural identity, their ethnic origins, their
[1375.54 --> 1376.28]  status in life.
[1376.36 --> 1378.76]  And now they're brought into one family by one thing.
[1379.52 --> 1386.20]  The power of Jesus, the reconciling force of the cross, has made them brother and sister.
[1387.00 --> 1391.02]  And he knew that when people walked by these little house churches and they saw slaves,
[1391.10 --> 1395.68]  women, men, free, all these different socioeconomic classes and ethnicities, when they could sit
[1395.68 --> 1400.20]  around a table and break bread and remember the work of Jesus, he knew that that proclaimed
[1400.20 --> 1403.34]  the power of the gospel to a divided world.
[1404.08 --> 1408.40]  It proclaimed the power of what Jesus did to Jews and Gentiles who would not break bread
[1408.40 --> 1408.80]  together.
[1409.12 --> 1410.16]  And the same is true today.
[1410.16 --> 1415.70]  When we gather together as believers, when we live in meaningful unity with denominations
[1415.70 --> 1419.92]  in our city, with brothers and sisters in other places throughout this area, and with
[1419.92 --> 1425.10]  our global family, when we live in meaningful unity, we are saying to the world, there is
[1425.10 --> 1429.42]  one thing that has broken through all the ethnic socioeconomic boundaries, and that is Jesus
[1429.42 --> 1429.90]  Christ.
[1430.52 --> 1432.02]  He has brought us into a family.
[1432.02 --> 1437.26]  And our unity in itself proclaims the power of the cross.
[1438.28 --> 1444.40]  And my prayer hope is that as God, by his goodness, diversifies our church, we learn that unity
[1444.40 --> 1444.86]  together.
[1445.08 --> 1445.70]  It's not easy.
[1446.22 --> 1446.94]  It's not simple.
[1447.28 --> 1452.32]  But as we do it, we get to be the ones who demonstrate to a divided city that the power
[1452.32 --> 1455.36]  of the gospel unifies us, no matter what our background.
[1456.18 --> 1457.48]  All praise be to Christ.
[1458.18 --> 1459.04]  Would you join me in prayer?
[1459.04 --> 1459.12]  Amen.
[1462.02 --> 1467.24]  Father, we thank you that we get to be part of your church.
[1469.56 --> 1473.00]  And we recognize, Lord, it is a privilege to be part of the body of Christ.
[1473.78 --> 1476.40]  It's a privilege to be part of the body of Christ here in Canada.
[1476.54 --> 1478.16]  We ask that you would make us faithful.
[1479.66 --> 1481.46]  We ask that you would make us humble.
[1482.64 --> 1486.04]  That some of the reflections shared by our youth about learning from the church in Mexico,
[1486.04 --> 1489.06]  Lord, make us learners from the body of Christ.
[1490.04 --> 1490.92]  Teach us humility.
[1492.02 --> 1493.16]  Teach us sacrifice.
[1494.44 --> 1495.30]  Teach us obedience.
[1496.66 --> 1497.74]  Teach us hospitality.
[1498.92 --> 1500.66]  Teach us how to value relationships.
[1501.76 --> 1508.12]  And Lord, enable us to cast off the idols of our culture so that the name of Jesus and
[1508.12 --> 1510.66]  the power of the gospel would be made known here.
[1511.54 --> 1514.84]  I thank you for the gift of believers from different parts of the world that are part of
[1514.84 --> 1515.72]  our church this morning.
[1516.42 --> 1522.30]  And I pray that you'd use them to deepen us, to strengthen us, to critique us, to lead us
[1522.30 --> 1525.56]  in a process of repentance and faith and obedience.
[1526.76 --> 1532.28]  To that end, Lord, would you fill us with your spirit and lead us into the mission field of Canada
[1532.28 --> 1536.24]  with joy and love and grace and truth.
[1536.24 --> 1538.16]  To you be all the glory.
[1538.16 --> 1538.74]  Amen.
