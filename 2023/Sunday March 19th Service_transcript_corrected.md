[0.00 → 7.98] I feel real drawn to that prayer person there.
[8.82 → 9.52] My wife.
[12.52 → 14.12] I want to say a special welcome.
[14.62 → 17.66] Cal and Marnie are joining us this morning, and it's so good to see you guys.
[18.60 → 19.90] We keep you in our prayers.
[20.82 → 21.90] Good to have you all here.
[23.46 → 27.90] We're in a series for our season of Lent.
[27.90 → 38.74] And maybe for those of you who are new to us, this series is entitled, In This World You Will Have Trouble.
[39.92 → 41.52] And you might think, well, there we go.
[41.64 → 43.20] What a cheerful church this is going to be.
[44.20 → 51.16] But this is a series that, as Lent happens, that we wrestle with the surrounding brokenness.
[51.50 → 53.82] And we wrestle with the brokenness within us.
[53.82 → 57.60] And the second part of that verse that Jesus says, In This World You Will Have Trouble, says,
[57.92 → 59.22] Take heart, I have overcome the world.
[59.38 → 60.52] And Easter's on the way.
[60.62 → 63.56] But in the meantime, we acknowledge the brokenness.
[63.72 → 65.62] We will have trouble.
[66.38 → 67.44] Not maybe, will.
[68.36 → 69.80] And we acknowledge that pain.
[70.06 → 75.04] And we acknowledge that this world and people are in need of healing and in need of transformation.
[75.68 → 76.80] So, yes, there's trouble.
[76.92 → 78.18] We see it all around us.
[78.18 → 83.44] We see it in our workplaces, in our health, and in our relationships.
[84.72 → 86.22] And I want to talk about that this morning.
[86.36 → 88.22] We've been dealing with different topics of suffering.
[88.72 → 93.62] And the one that we want to address this morning is this idea of broken relationships.
[95.90 → 100.60] Let me ask you, any one of you here ever been hurt deeply by someone?
[103.16 → 103.62] Yeah.
[103.62 → 107.44] Anyone here ever hurt somebody else deeply?
[109.08 → 116.74] And I suspect we could get lots of stories about hurts that we've received and probably hurts that we've given.
[118.82 → 125.06] As a long-time pastor, in all honesty, you get to see too much pain between people.
[125.06 → 141.72] The pain of betrayal, the pain of gossip, the pain of unfaithfulness, the pain of abuse, the pain of divorce, the pain of broken friendships, the pain of struggles about issues between people in culture and in churches.
[142.26 → 144.32] There's so much pain.
[145.66 → 147.68] So many unkind words get spoken.
[147.84 → 151.02] Cold words, vicious words, arrogant words.
[151.02 → 154.66] And so much blindness to the pain we cause one another.
[155.08 → 161.72] Division between political side, between families, between spouses, between friends, between churches.
[163.32 → 165.90] Sometimes we hardly know how it even happened.
[167.16 → 168.06] But there it is.
[168.70 → 171.62] All this relational brokenness.
[171.62 → 179.72] And if you're honest, you see that same brokenness in you.
[181.16 → 184.06] We all are part of that.
[184.40 → 185.56] That's why Jesus came.
[187.00 → 190.98] We're all longing for things to be better than they are.
[191.24 → 193.88] We're all longing to love better.
[193.88 → 196.72] I was thinking about that.
[196.84 → 204.30] You know, that Paul is known for writing the most amazing description of love ever written in 1 Corinthians 13.
[204.76 → 206.80] I'm not going to read it all, but sometimes it's called the love chapter.
[207.16 → 209.40] But you know, in it, often used at weddings.
[209.58 → 212.02] Done it, spoken on this topic at many weddings.
[212.14 → 214.24] But love is patient, is kind.
[214.56 → 215.42] Love is humble.
[215.78 → 216.90] Love is not self-seeking.
[217.04 → 217.88] Not easily angered.
[219.32 → 221.70] It keeps no record of wrong.
[221.70 → 225.12] It rejoices in the truth.
[225.58 → 227.42] It always protects.
[227.68 → 229.76] It always perseveres.
[231.26 → 232.46] Wow, that's amazing.
[233.36 → 234.26] We might say, yeah, that's it.
[234.32 → 234.98] That's what I want.
[235.24 → 236.06] We all know this.
[236.14 → 240.66] We see it, and we think so clearly in our relationships when things are going well.
[240.72 → 246.28] Yeah, then I'm patient, and I'm kind, and I'm not keeping any records of wrongs.
[247.76 → 249.26] I'm not doing those things here.
[249.26 → 254.82] And then, you know, we're not having struggles with divisions in our families, our churches, our workplaces, our schools.
[254.96 → 257.70] Because we all know what it takes to love well, right?
[257.76 → 258.92] I mean, it's easy, right?
[259.00 → 260.06] We all get it.
[260.18 → 263.28] So, we have no divisions around us, right?
[265.78 → 266.78] I wish it was true.
[266.78 → 274.24] Paul writes that chapter, and he gives this beautiful description of what love does.
[275.26 → 278.28] And we can read it and go, oh, man, I want that.
[278.80 → 283.84] Every couple I've married and read that passage, oh, man, that's what we're going to do.
[284.56 → 286.42] We're going to live that one out.
[286.42 → 290.52] And, yeah, well, for now.
[292.02 → 293.28] And then there are moments.
[294.06 → 297.46] And anybody who's been married a long time knows we get a little bit of this going on sometime.
[298.00 → 300.76] And sometimes it's, say, wow, I don't know.
[301.76 → 303.08] I don't know if I can hang in there.
[303.20 → 304.20] Sometimes we feel that way.
[304.20 → 310.60] And Paul writes something in that chapter, 1 Corinthians 13, that's interesting to me.
[310.66 → 312.26] So, this beautiful description of love.
[312.66 → 316.86] And then these lines out of 1 Corinthians 13, verses 9, 12, and 13.
[317.46 → 320.74] And I think this is profoundly important for us to address.
[321.96 → 323.78] We know in part.
[324.66 → 327.50] We prophesy in part.
[328.44 → 329.82] Prophesy and speak in God's words.
[329.82 → 333.62] For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror.
[334.00 → 335.88] Other paths today we see dimly.
[336.48 → 336.58] Right?
[336.86 → 338.76] And then we shall see face to face.
[339.08 → 341.92] Now I know in part.
[342.66 → 348.80] Then, when I come into glory, I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
[348.90 → 351.22] Because isn't it a wonderful thing to be fully known?
[353.48 → 355.90] And now these three remain.
[355.90 → 360.02] And faith, I believe, and hope, because they've got to hang on to something.
[360.48 → 362.46] And love, and the greatest of these is love.
[364.46 → 368.78] Here's the takeaway I want you to take with you.
[370.22 → 374.06] We don't see clearly.
[376.38 → 377.18] None of you.
[377.64 → 378.28] Not me.
[379.56 → 380.56] We think we do.
[381.66 → 383.86] You know, some of you might say, well, I get it.
[383.92 → 384.56] Just ask me.
[384.56 → 385.62] I'll tell you how it goes.
[386.82 → 392.60] People of hope, in all my years of pastoring, and my many, many years of marriage, and living life,
[392.88 → 399.74] this acknowledgement of seeing partly, of seeing dimly, has been important to my understanding
[399.74 → 402.88] and my relational building with others.
[402.88 → 409.34] My experience says, we don't know very much.
[410.34 → 415.54] And many, many people don't even know themselves very well.
[416.68 → 421.96] Again, they might think they do, which is a bit of a red flag, because they probably don't.
[421.96 → 426.64] Many think they see clearly.
[427.74 → 428.68] Loving well.
[428.84 → 430.04] Paul gave that nice description.
[430.42 → 436.54] Loving well requires us to say, hey, I don't see particularly clearly a lot of the time.
[436.82 → 438.54] I only see in part.
[438.76 → 442.46] As faith community, we don't see particularly clearly.
[442.74 → 443.78] We need God's Word.
[443.96 → 444.94] We need the Holy Spirit.
[445.16 → 446.10] We need all that stuff.
[446.10 → 450.16] But even when I read the Bible, sometimes I'm not even sure I'm reading it right.
[451.16 → 456.38] Thus, we need each other, and we need God's guidance through His Holy Spirit,
[456.50 → 458.26] and we need to just wrestle with those things.
[458.26 → 467.18] I want to look at a faith community that Paul was talked to in Colossus.
[467.64 → 473.98] I want to read 1 Colossians 3, 1-17, because I think he gives some beautiful descriptions
[473.98 → 480.66] of what we collectively need to do in our relational skill-building processes.
[481.60 → 486.84] And he's going to be doing a lot of talking about getting rid of some things and putting other things on.
[486.84 → 491.42] And then we're going to build our relational skills through doing that,
[491.76 → 493.70] and our love skills through doing that.
[494.26 → 494.92] So look at it with me.
[495.10 → 498.12] 1 Colossians 3, 1-17.
[499.98 → 504.24] Since then, you have been raised with Christ.
[504.32 → 506.00] Now, that's a huge line.
[507.20 → 508.58] You have been raised with Christ.
[508.90 → 510.50] That's who you are now.
[510.74 → 513.48] Since you've been raised with Christ.
[513.48 → 513.82] Okay.
[514.42 → 516.54] We ought to see something then.
[517.62 → 519.06] It's not just a belief statement.
[519.16 → 519.88] Oh, I believe in Jesus.
[520.32 → 521.70] There's nothing to change my life.
[521.92 → 522.56] That's not.
[522.70 → 523.56] No, no, no, no.
[523.96 → 526.22] Since we have been raised with Christ.
[526.34 → 526.54] Okay.
[526.58 → 527.14] What are we going to do?
[527.64 → 531.72] Set your hearts on things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[533.16 → 534.08] Read that well.
[534.30 → 537.14] It's not saying, you know, I don't care about anything in the world anymore.
[537.32 → 538.68] Just be heavenly minded.
[539.68 → 540.78] That's not what it's saying.
[540.78 → 542.98] It's saying, keep the big picture in mind.
[543.22 → 546.34] Keep the big perspective question or setting in mind.
[546.70 → 548.14] Set your mind on things above.
[548.42 → 549.48] Not earthly things.
[549.58 → 551.64] Things that don't really matter.
[553.28 → 554.98] For you died.
[554.98 → 558.46] You died.
[558.46 → 558.86] I died.
[558.86 → 559.74] I died.
[560.04 → 562.78] You died, and your life is now hidden with Christ and God.
[563.14 → 568.78] When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you will also appear with him in glory.
[568.94 → 571.04] And you see this beautiful future perspective going on there.
[571.60 → 572.30] Put to death.
[572.46 → 572.64] Okay.
[572.68 → 573.42] What are you going to put to death?
[573.42 → 579.10] Therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature, sexual immorality, impurity, lust,
[579.20 → 581.98] evil desires, greed, which is idolatry.
[582.38 → 584.24] Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.
[584.48 → 589.62] Because God doesn't want you to live in ways that are contrary to good living, to good life.
[589.80 → 589.96] Okay.
[590.42 → 594.52] You used to walk in these ways in the life you once lived.
[595.38 → 601.66] But now you must also rid yourself of all such things such as anger, rage, malice, slander,
[601.96 → 603.32] filthy language from your lips.
[603.42 → 607.80] Don't lie to each other since you have taken off your old self with its practices.
[608.02 → 610.38] Because lifestyle choices have practices.
[611.08 → 613.82] And have put on the new self, which is being.
[613.92 → 614.50] There's a good word.
[615.00 → 618.90] Being renewed in the knowledge of the image of its creator.
[619.70 → 622.02] And then here, then, there is no Gentile or Jew.
[622.18 → 623.12] There's class distinction.
[623.52 → 624.82] Circumcised or uncircumcised.
[625.16 → 627.18] Barbarian, Mission, slave or free.
[627.34 → 631.50] Because Christ is all and is in all.
[631.50 → 631.98] Therefore.
[632.98 → 633.46] Therefore.
[633.92 → 634.22] Alright.
[634.38 → 636.00] So we're taking off all that stuff.
[636.28 → 637.22] That's an ongoing process.
[637.64 → 639.76] Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly love.
[640.10 → 640.46] Now what?
[640.50 → 641.06] What are you going to put on?
[641.22 → 646.52] Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
[647.34 → 648.98] Bear with each other.
[648.98 → 649.02] Bear with each other.
[651.08 → 653.54] That's way deeper than put up with each other.
[654.94 → 657.26] It's not talking about putting up with each other.
[657.44 → 658.04] Bear with each other.
[658.18 → 659.12] Carry each other.
[659.20 → 659.98] That's what's going on there.
[661.54 → 666.44] Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone.
[666.54 → 667.60] Well, what if they have an ass?
[667.96 → 670.18] Forgive if you have a grievance.
[670.52 → 671.58] Even if they have an ass.
[671.82 → 673.46] Forgive if the Lord forgave you.
[674.38 → 676.10] And over all these virtues, put on love.
[676.18 → 680.74] And we've got that beautiful list of what it looks like, which binds them together in perfect unity.
[681.02 → 682.22] Notice unity is love.
[682.92 → 684.50] It's not agreement on everything.
[685.62 → 687.10] Let the peace of Christ rule in your heart.
[687.20 → 689.24] Since as members of one body, you were called to peace.
[689.40 → 690.40] And be thankful.
[690.66 → 691.38] Well, even when it's hard?
[691.46 → 692.46] Yeah, be thankful then too.
[692.46 → 697.38] Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another.
[697.50 → 698.84] Because that's part of being in community.
[698.84 → 700.12] With all wisdom.
[700.24 → 700.80] Oh, what wisdom?
[700.90 → 701.42] God's wisdom.
[701.96 → 704.24] Through psalms and hymns and songs from the Spirit.
[704.60 → 706.88] Singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.
[707.36 → 708.54] And whatever you do.
[708.68 → 710.80] There's a pretty solid line there.
[710.94 → 712.48] Whatever you do.
[712.66 → 713.96] Whether it in word or in deed.
[714.06 → 715.80] Do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[716.24 → 718.52] Giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
[720.12 → 727.88] So we've got this list of rid yourselves off and take off those things that hurt your lives in community and relationships.
[727.88 → 731.54] And they're sometimes hard to see in yourself.
[732.74 → 735.96] They might leak out of you in ways you don't even know.
[739.60 → 744.72] And once you know, and you're wrestling with those things that you see you need to get rid of some stuff,
[744.94 → 747.74] you can then start putting on some things in place.
[748.46 → 753.16] But notice it starts with seeing yourself clearly because,
[753.30 → 756.10] going back to that verse out of 1 Corinthians 13,
[756.10 → 759.76] because you don't see clearly.
[761.56 → 762.48] You don't.
[763.38 → 764.18] Yes, I do.
[764.36 → 765.28] No, you don't.
[766.16 → 767.64] You don't see clearly.
[768.10 → 770.26] The thing that Paul described in his love chapter,
[771.16 → 772.48] we're going to put those on.
[772.54 → 773.34] And he says it here too.
[773.40 → 776.22] Then we're going to put on compassion and kindness and humility and gentleness.
[776.68 → 777.46] Put them on.
[777.58 → 778.26] How often?
[778.40 → 780.20] Again and again and again.
[780.20 → 780.52] Why?
[780.68 → 783.70] Because we take those things off without even noticing it,
[783.82 → 786.18] or we put something silly over top.
[786.76 → 790.42] We try to put something over top of some broken thing and never deal with it.
[790.58 → 791.62] It's still there.
[793.12 → 794.62] And you're still just as messy.
[794.62 → 798.48] We put on Christ again and again and again.
[798.78 → 801.92] And then his peace should rule in your hearts and in your lives together.
[802.48 → 805.44] And in this passage, the word you are always plural.
[805.74 → 811.92] It's always talking to us, to the Corinthians and the Colossians and so forth.
[812.54 → 816.20] We're in this together with all the messiness of life.
[816.20 → 822.10] So yes, I'm going to strive to put on compassion.
[822.98 → 823.80] But here's something we do.
[824.00 → 828.10] But only with those who see things my way.
[829.08 → 830.08] Only those people.
[830.62 → 831.48] That's not how it works.
[832.28 → 838.52] I find it ironic that the word tolerance today usually means I'm tolerant only if you agree with me,
[838.60 → 840.34] which of course isn't tolerance.
[841.76 → 843.06] Put on humility.
[844.68 → 845.60] What is humility?
[845.60 → 848.96] It is a lack of focus on yourself.
[849.36 → 851.06] Not a disregard of yourself.
[851.26 → 853.14] Just a lack of focus on yourself.
[853.48 → 859.00] You're not all that focused on your opinions and your big massive thoughts that everybody should agree with.
[859.58 → 861.42] You're just not wired that way.
[862.12 → 867.26] You're focused on loving even and especially those who are even difficult to love.
[870.24 → 872.10] We're putting on Jesus.
[872.66 → 874.70] The one who said, love your enemies.
[875.60 → 878.26] Sounds a lot more powerful than tolerance, doesn't it?
[879.06 → 879.86] A lot more powerful.
[879.86 → 885.02] I don't need then to insist on you seeing everything the way I do.
[885.02 → 891.16] Without putting on compassion and humility, relationships just don't work very well.
[891.40 → 895.78] They don't work very well in churches or in marriages or in friendships or anywhere else.
[895.78 → 896.78] I read an interesting story.
[896.78 → 902.04] I read an interesting story recently about the communist government in China under Chairman Mao.
[902.04 → 906.22] The sparrows were eating lots of seeds.
[906.22 → 911.56] The Chinese government under Mao at the time said, wow, these sparrows are wrecking everything.
[911.76 → 915.20] They're making our crops a lot smaller because they're eating all the seeds.
[915.76 → 921.12] They decided to call them animals of capitalism because that's what we do about the other side here.
[921.20 → 922.48] We just demonize them.
[922.60 → 923.78] That's what we all do, right?
[923.78 → 935.66] And there was a massive campaign in China at that time of noise launched to keep the birds flying until they dropped dead and just fell from the sky.
[936.76 → 944.86] And pots and pans were beaten all day long and fireworks were set off and nests were destroyed until millions of birds died.
[944.86 → 949.00] And you might say, well, success, our plan worked.
[949.22 → 958.32] We solved the problem until the insects that the sparrows ate multiplied and those insects ate the crops and there was a famine and millions of people died.
[959.84 → 963.96] And the government was then forced to import hundreds of thousands of birds from other countries.
[965.46 → 966.66] A brilliant plan.
[968.62 → 971.62] We think we see clearly.
[971.62 → 975.48] We think we have all the solutions.
[976.82 → 979.30] We think our solution is the one.
[979.72 → 981.72] We think we've considered all the options.
[982.28 → 988.66] But more and more, we tend to live in an echo chamber and in lockstep with people who already think just like we do.
[990.46 → 992.12] And here's the weird part of that.
[992.64 → 1000.30] We actually need each other with differences because those differences keep us all somewhat more honest and engaged.
[1001.62 → 1008.40] When we stick just to our opinions and people around us who are different, we don't want them around.
[1008.68 → 1013.42] We do less and less listening and more and more browbeating other arguments into submission.
[1014.52 → 1019.02] And this is often true whether you lean to the right or the left, or you go right down the middle.
[1019.10 → 1019.58] It doesn't matter.
[1019.92 → 1023.92] With little humility, with little compassion, relationships don't work.
[1023.92 → 1028.08] Remind yourself.
[1029.20 → 1030.82] We see through a mirror dimly.
[1030.96 → 1032.26] We see in part.
[1032.74 → 1034.96] We don't keep score.
[1038.08 → 1042.12] We all know those whose primary mode of interaction is denouncement.
[1042.30 → 1043.38] We're just going to put you down.
[1043.38 → 1045.80] It isn't about doing life together.
[1046.46 → 1050.30] It's about when it should be about seeking understanding.
[1050.48 → 1054.50] Instead, we replace that with blame and attack and self-righteousness.
[1056.00 → 1057.34] Because we know best, right?
[1057.34 → 1062.76] And it creates division in society, in marriages, in churches, in families, in friendships.
[1063.44 → 1064.36] Put off.
[1064.78 → 1065.78] Put to death.
[1066.30 → 1069.48] Whatever belongs to your earthly nature, your self-centred drive.
[1069.76 → 1071.42] And set your mind on things above.
[1071.68 → 1074.88] On being like Christ for those around you.
[1075.64 → 1080.48] Rid yourself of anger and malice and rage and slander and lies and filthy talk and greed.
[1080.88 → 1081.58] Die to that.
[1081.70 → 1082.44] Put that off.
[1082.44 → 1087.22] Otherwise, we're stuck in our kill the sparrow solutions that don't work.
[1087.34 → 1095.02] With our limited perspectives and our denial of how unclear we see a lot of things.
[1095.98 → 1098.74] We don't see it all by a long shot.
[1099.98 → 1100.68] No one does.
[1102.60 → 1105.96] And then Paul calls us to put on kindness and gentleness.
[1106.58 → 1107.62] Simple, really, right?
[1107.72 → 1108.20] Be kind.
[1108.30 → 1108.72] Be gentle.
[1108.82 → 1109.62] Sounds simple enough.
[1110.10 → 1113.30] But, you know, then I hear people say, but I'm really, really, really mad.
[1113.46 → 1115.68] And I'm really, really, really right.
[1115.68 → 1118.48] But, then these folks ought to listen to me.
[1120.86 → 1122.26] That husband ought to listen to me.
[1122.32 → 1123.34] That wife ought to listen to me.
[1123.80 → 1124.04] You know?
[1124.34 → 1126.44] And I would say, put that attitude off.
[1127.02 → 1127.78] Put that off.
[1128.40 → 1129.98] Put on kindness and gentleness instead.
[1130.36 → 1131.82] It's okay to differ, but do it gently.
[1133.10 → 1136.56] Then you're ready to listen a lot and to talk a little bit.
[1136.56 → 1141.38] Kindness and gentleness recognize that we're all pretty fragile.
[1142.12 → 1146.54] And we need to be careful with each other, even while trying to correct sometimes.
[1146.54 → 1150.02] And then Paul says, put on patience.
[1151.04 → 1152.66] The world is full of problems.
[1152.76 → 1153.44] We all know that.
[1153.54 → 1157.14] And people easily get stubborn or arrogant or annoying.
[1157.70 → 1159.00] And we need a lot of patience.
[1159.14 → 1165.28] Tons of patience is needed to keep walking with each other, especially with those we differ with.
[1165.50 → 1169.38] If we want to learn to love well.
[1169.54 → 1173.94] Because you don't get any credit for loving only those people who love you back.
[1173.94 → 1179.84] You need to love those who you differ with strongly and maybe don't even like very much.
[1180.16 → 1181.74] That's Christ-like love.
[1182.90 → 1184.76] We need to keep walking that way.
[1185.00 → 1189.86] Otherwise, it feels so much easier to just walk away.
[1190.92 → 1192.28] Walk out of the marriage.
[1193.12 → 1194.16] Walk out of the church.
[1194.36 → 1195.42] Walk out of the job.
[1195.58 → 1197.52] Walk out of, walk away, walk away, walk away.
[1197.96 → 1199.60] And never grow.
[1200.60 → 1201.74] Just keep walking away.
[1203.94 → 1207.36] And I know that's challenging.
[1210.06 → 1213.22] You know, Paul talks about having the same mind and purpose as Christ.
[1215.54 → 1216.44] Is that how you live?
[1218.16 → 1220.02] Having the mind of Christ.
[1220.16 → 1227.24] You're aiming to make your mind, or at least surrendering your mind, so it becomes exactly like Christ.
[1227.24 → 1229.02] Is that your goal?
[1231.60 → 1236.22] You wake up every day going to work saying, okay, time to have the mind of Christ.
[1238.68 → 1241.56] Time to have His purposes run my life.
[1241.72 → 1243.12] Are you really living that way?
[1243.42 → 1245.00] And a lot of you are saying, well, I don't know.
[1245.12 → 1246.20] But that's not how we have to live, is it?
[1246.84 → 1248.44] Same mind and purpose as Christ.
[1248.80 → 1249.58] That's the goal?
[1249.66 → 1250.80] And the answer is yes, it is.
[1250.80 → 1252.56] Yes, it is.
[1253.94 → 1261.72] The goal isn't you trying to run life according to your schedule and agenda and everything else.
[1261.86 → 1265.16] It's for you to live out the mission of Christ in your life.
[1265.22 → 1268.56] Whatever that means for your kids and your marriage and your workplaces and everything else.
[1269.26 → 1272.54] Paul's saying, keep the focus on the big picture.
[1272.94 → 1276.38] It's interesting when Jesus says on the cross, Father, forgive them.
[1276.68 → 1278.44] They know not what they do, right?
[1278.44 → 1280.34] So He's hanging on a cross, He's been crucified.
[1280.78 → 1281.82] And He says, Father, forgive them.
[1281.88 → 1282.82] They know not what they do.
[1283.14 → 1285.34] Did they put Him up there accidentally?
[1288.22 → 1288.98] Of course not.
[1289.60 → 1291.06] What's Jesus talking about?
[1291.34 → 1293.48] They don't see the big picture.
[1293.84 → 1296.30] They don't see what's really going on.
[1299.62 → 1300.72] They're missing it.
[1302.52 → 1305.36] This loving Saviour coming to rescue and transform the world.
[1305.52 → 1307.36] They're not seeing that at all.
[1307.36 → 1308.76] That's what Jesus is talking about.
[1308.96 → 1310.96] That's what we need to remind ourselves of.
[1312.44 → 1314.42] Paul keeps saying, keep the big picture in mind.
[1314.92 → 1316.80] You are in Christ.
[1317.10 → 1319.42] You are baptized into one body.
[1319.72 → 1321.32] You drink one spirit.
[1321.76 → 1325.96] Well, even that guy who I disagree with so strongly, yeah, you drink together of one spirit.
[1326.08 → 1327.18] What does that mean to you?
[1327.18 → 1339.90] Old ways of identity, our tribes, of understanding oneself, and our neighbour are replaced by the oneness in Christ
[1339.90 → 1343.44] because His mind is becoming our mind.
[1343.44 → 1350.16] So Paul writes in Galatians 3.
[1350.56 → 1351.20] Look at it with me.
[1352.00 → 1356.80] So in Christ, you are all children of God through faith.
[1356.80 → 1362.76] All of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ.
[1362.76 → 1369.30] There is then neither Jew nor Gentile, slave or free.
[1369.72 → 1373.84] There is neither male nor female if we were all one in Christ.
[1373.84 → 1379.88] And Paul is saying the unity we deeply long for comes from our shared connection to Jesus.
[1380.80 → 1387.74] And the death and resurrection of Christ signals the beginning of an age in which all the ways that the Corinthians and us, for that matter too,
[1388.12 → 1390.00] we align ourselves into groups.
[1390.96 → 1395.38] And we realize those groupings and those tribes, they just aren't that important or all that defining.
[1395.38 → 1400.30] We are baptized into the risen Christ and are numbered among God's children.
[1400.70 → 1401.46] That's who you are.
[1403.24 → 1404.08] That's who you are.
[1405.58 → 1407.64] And then there's no division in that.
[1407.88 → 1410.92] It's not saying you won't have any differences of opinion, but there's no division in that.
[1411.10 → 1414.78] Our unity in Christ is stronger than differences of opinion.
[1415.80 → 1420.68] Too often we think our differences are the things that make us who we are and how we relate to one another, right?
[1420.68 → 1425.26] That's why in the beginning of the passage I could have read to you where people are saying,
[1425.36 → 1426.58] Well, I'm for Peter.
[1427.08 → 1428.06] Well, I'm for Paul.
[1428.36 → 1429.48] Well, I'm for Apollos.
[1430.12 → 1431.48] I'm for Jesus, right?
[1431.80 → 1434.26] And they're naming their tribe.
[1434.38 → 1436.64] They're naming the guy that they think they follow.
[1437.28 → 1439.92] And in the ancient world it mattered whose family you were a part of.
[1440.18 → 1443.32] This is where you found your wealth and your power and your influence and your privileges.
[1443.84 → 1450.28] Unity is then about being the context of banding together with those who think like you against everybody else.
[1450.68 → 1458.10] It's not unity.
[1460.28 → 1461.20] It's not unity.
[1463.94 → 1466.72] That's why Paul even criticized those folks who said,
[1466.92 → 1468.08] I belong to Jesus.
[1468.24 → 1469.00] I win, right?
[1469.28 → 1470.32] That's where I'm at.
[1470.34 → 1471.32] I belong to Jesus.
[1471.78 → 1472.92] And you say, well, why is that?
[1473.08 → 1473.74] Aren't they right?
[1474.28 → 1474.90] And you know what?
[1475.18 → 1477.78] I would say Paul would have said, well, they have the right name but the wrong motive.
[1479.26 → 1480.44] They're still about winning.
[1481.52 → 1483.80] And apparently we don't even keep score when we love well.
[1487.80 → 1490.92] 1 Corinthians 1, Paul says in verse 10 and 11,
[1491.40 → 1492.36] I appeal to you.
[1492.44 → 1498.40] And that word, I'm kind of appealing a little bit right now too, right?
[1498.40 → 1501.46] I beg you.
[1503.14 → 1504.30] I beg you.
[1504.96 → 1506.18] That's what Paul is really saying.
[1506.46 → 1512.54] I beg you, brothers and sisters, in the name of the Lord Jesus, the thing that matters most,
[1512.62 → 1517.44] the perspective we need to hold, that all of you agree with one another in what you say
[1517.44 → 1519.92] and there be no divisions among you.
[1522.24 → 1526.20] But that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.
[1527.28 → 1533.78] My brothers and sisters, some from Chloe's household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.
[1533.78 → 1541.08] So the problem here isn't that they had a few differences here and there, but that they're fighting about it.
[1541.22 → 1542.24] They're quarrelling about it.
[1542.30 → 1543.56] They're arguing about it.
[1545.40 → 1549.16] And Paul had just finished saying, circumcised or not circumcised, it's no difference.
[1549.86 → 1550.92] Slave or free, no difference.
[1551.18 → 1552.28] Man or woman, no difference.
[1552.28 → 1557.04] Are those areas where there are some problems, some tensions?
[1557.20 → 1557.42] Sure.
[1557.96 → 1559.68] But in Christ, we're one.
[1559.78 → 1560.40] We see that.
[1560.60 → 1562.20] And now we can work on some of the problems.
[1562.26 → 1562.84] That's fine.
[1563.90 → 1565.70] But our unity matters more.
[1566.48 → 1571.94] And clothing ourselves in Christ doesn't erase those differences, but it covers them with love.
[1575.16 → 1580.32] Paul's not saying we need to be identical, only that we cease to work at cross purposes
[1580.32 → 1583.54] and instead work for cross purposes.
[1586.20 → 1587.34] So stop quarrelling.
[1588.26 → 1589.50] Stop the self-righteousness.
[1589.88 → 1590.82] Stop the competitiveness.
[1591.00 → 1591.82] Stop the manipulation.
[1593.40 → 1597.58] You don't see all that clearly anyway.
[1600.64 → 1602.14] This isn't about scoring a win.
[1603.06 → 1604.18] Because remember, we don't keep score.
[1605.34 → 1608.30] And Paul knew firsthand self-righteousness.
[1608.30 → 1608.90] Right?
[1608.90 → 1615.10] When he was working for the Pharisees and hunting Christians down, he was doing it with a zeal
[1615.10 → 1616.42] of rightness.
[1617.50 → 1620.20] I'm catching these Christians because they're bad people.
[1620.50 → 1622.92] And I'm going to bring them to justice and set them straight.
[1623.24 → 1624.82] Paul knew that self-righteousness.
[1625.02 → 1626.72] He thought it was just righteousness.
[1627.10 → 1629.08] Because that's how self-righteousness works.
[1629.08 → 1634.96] And then on the road to Damascus, Jesus transforms him.
[1635.38 → 1640.50] And this same radical transformation takes place in us, in our communities, when we truly
[1640.50 → 1641.76] encounter the risen Saviour.
[1642.60 → 1648.78] But first, you need to die to self and pick up your cross daily.
[1650.78 → 1651.24] Daily.
[1651.24 → 1651.32] Daily.
[1651.32 → 1658.28] Much of the environment that we live in doesn't support relational connection very well.
[1659.48 → 1662.08] We have tribes, and we demonize each other.
[1662.16 → 1662.94] You see it all the time.
[1663.20 → 1664.42] That side's filled with hate.
[1664.56 → 1665.30] That side's this.
[1665.42 → 1666.14] That side's that.
[1666.34 → 1667.54] And we argue and we hate.
[1669.04 → 1670.36] And just go back in your memory.
[1670.36 → 1675.90] Anyone ever have a heated discussion about whether to wear masks or not?
[1678.20 → 1679.98] Whether to get vaccinated or not?
[1680.10 → 1681.62] That was fun, wasn't it?
[1685.26 → 1687.78] That side is stupid and that side is brilliant.
[1687.92 → 1689.04] That's not how we want to play it.
[1689.46 → 1690.56] And I'm not saying...
[1690.56 → 1693.92] It was worthwhile conversation, but sometimes the tone was awful.
[1695.64 → 1696.56] And social media.
[1696.80 → 1697.62] Oh, man, here we go.
[1697.62 → 1699.66] That isn't a particularly good social tool.
[1700.36 → 1706.12] And we constantly talk in our culture about self-trust and self-care and self-expression.
[1706.94 → 1707.80] And I feel that...
[1707.80 → 1710.18] I'm not saying you shouldn't take care of yourself.
[1710.64 → 1712.28] Love your neighbour as yourself.
[1712.40 → 1713.18] That's a good thing.
[1713.68 → 1717.36] But Jesus said in John 15, I don't have it on here, but he says this.
[1717.68 → 1721.72] Greater love has no one than to lay down his life for a friend.
[1722.32 → 1722.64] Okay.
[1722.88 → 1723.66] And I was thinking about that.
[1723.72 → 1727.56] We get that in the sense, yeah, you know, I would die for my friend.
[1727.80 → 1728.74] That's great love.
[1728.76 → 1729.18] And it is.
[1729.18 → 1733.66] But I wondered whether we limit it to just dying for somebody.
[1734.00 → 1739.62] How about I lay down my life for you in terms of my big opinion?
[1741.08 → 1744.62] I lay down my opinion in my big mouth.
[1744.86 → 1747.12] I lay that aside for you because I love you.
[1747.12 → 1754.44] I lay down my brilliant arguments because I love you.
[1756.78 → 1761.18] I lay down my ego because I love you.
[1764.80 → 1766.00] Makes me think of my dad.
[1766.10 → 1768.88] My dad, I love the man, but, man, he had an ego.
[1768.88 → 1773.62] And he would say sometimes, and it made me and my sisters laugh a lot.
[1773.96 → 1776.72] He would sometimes say, I have no ego.
[1776.72 → 1783.16] And, you know, my sister and I always wonder, do you hear yourself?
[1784.64 → 1786.40] If you had no ego, you wouldn't have noticed.
[1788.00 → 1789.38] You know, so he had a big ego.
[1789.38 → 1793.48] And it would have been good for him to realize that because then you can fight it.
[1795.20 → 1797.58] If you don't have one, you don't have anything to fight, right?
[1798.04 → 1802.02] So, lay down your life for somebody else.
[1802.16 → 1803.22] What would that mean?
[1803.42 → 1806.18] Not just dying but in giving yourself to somebody else.
[1806.18 → 1810.26] And this involves struggle and this involves burden because that's what relationships are.
[1810.74 → 1813.22] And, you know, and we say, well, we belong to each other.
[1813.30 → 1813.88] Yeah, that's true.
[1814.22 → 1816.76] But belonging is a profound responsibility.
[1817.88 → 1819.54] It's not just a byproduct of relationships.
[1820.22 → 1822.06] A process of continually doing what?
[1822.42 → 1825.74] Well, taking some things off, all those things that are hurting relationships,
[1826.02 → 1829.76] and constantly putting on Christ again and again and again and again.
[1836.18 → 1840.56] Paul later talks about being a part of Christ's ministry of reconciliation
[1840.56 → 1842.84] where people are brought together in Christ's love and power.
[1844.40 → 1846.48] Again, this doesn't mean there aren't any disagreements.
[1846.88 → 1849.48] It's just there's tone and there's the way we approach other.
[1849.60 → 1850.34] Love is first.
[1851.02 → 1852.82] And then we talk about the context of love.
[1853.26 → 1854.48] That's a way different conversation.
[1855.02 → 1858.12] And it starts with realizing you see in part,
[1858.34 → 1863.02] and we all have lots of baggage to unpack from our family of background,
[1863.02 → 1867.20] from our upbringings, from our workplaces, from where we grew up,
[1867.22 → 1869.34] or what happened to us, and from our self-centredness.
[1869.88 → 1871.98] We have lots of baggage to unpack.
[1872.38 → 1874.16] Folks, really, I see it all the time.
[1874.48 → 1876.58] People don't know themselves very well.
[1881.06 → 1884.34] And I need to listen well in order to love well.
[1885.22 → 1887.68] We need to understand each other even if we don't always agree.
[1888.90 → 1890.62] This isn't about winning and losing.
[1890.62 → 1893.72] This is about unity in Christ, the one who died for us,
[1894.42 → 1896.04] so that we could really live.
[1898.10 → 1900.78] I want to conclude this verse with Revelations.
[1902.30 → 1904.40] Because I want to talk about big picture.
[1906.48 → 1907.52] Where's this story going?
[1909.08 → 1911.98] In Revelations 21, we say, we read this,
[1912.36 → 1914.26] Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[1915.14 → 1917.66] For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.
[1917.96 → 1919.40] There was no longer any sea.
[1919.40 → 1920.44] I'm going to talk about that in a moment.
[1921.36 → 1922.98] I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem,
[1923.12 → 1924.86] coming down out of heaven from God,
[1924.96 → 1927.76] prepared as a beautiful bride,
[1927.86 → 1929.26] beautifully dressed for her husband.
[1929.62 → 1932.80] And you get this picture of God and us involved in some kind of,
[1932.98 → 1933.86] like a wedding.
[1935.00 → 1937.06] And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[1937.48 → 1937.84] Look!
[1939.30 → 1940.08] Pay attention!
[1940.08 → 1944.16] God's dwelling is now among His people and He will dwell with them.
[1944.16 → 1945.74] Well, but they're really messy people.
[1945.96 → 1947.52] Yeah, that's why He's showing up.
[1947.56 → 1948.46] He will dwell with them.
[1948.72 → 1952.08] They will be His people and God Himself will be with them and be their God.
[1952.38 → 1955.02] And He will clean them up and transform them.
[1955.54 → 1957.30] And in the next life, we will,
[1957.88 → 1960.04] well, He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
[1960.76 → 1963.30] And there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain,
[1963.30 → 1965.16] for the old order of things has passed away.
[1965.40 → 1966.98] And He who was seated on the throne said,
[1967.38 → 1971.12] I am making everything new.
[1971.52 → 1973.04] And it's a process that begins now.
[1976.74 → 1978.78] It's interesting that no more seas' thing.
[1978.96 → 1980.28] I was reading a little bit about that.
[1980.64 → 1982.88] One of the clear symbols of chaos and fear in Scripture
[1982.88 → 1984.66] were the waters, the seas.
[1984.66 → 1986.74] Danger, uncertainty.
[1987.98 → 1990.04] We've got this new heaven, new earth, but no more seas.
[1990.82 → 1993.36] Really what it's saying is no more fear and chaos.
[1994.92 → 1998.92] How many of you are tired of the surrounding chaos?
[2002.42 → 2004.44] You're tired of the chaos in your marriage.
[2005.82 → 2009.76] You're tired of the chaos with your kids or with your parents.
[2010.22 → 2011.88] You're tired of the chaos at work.
[2011.88 → 2015.36] You're tired of the chaos in institutions and schools and churches.
[2015.66 → 2018.74] You're tired of the chaos in society at large.
[2019.16 → 2020.22] You're just tired of it.
[2023.28 → 2024.50] And yet, here we are.
[2024.70 → 2027.02] We live at this point with chaos.
[2029.18 → 2031.54] And we're awaiting all things to be made new.
[2033.00 → 2035.88] Whether there be no more tears or death or chaos.
[2036.32 → 2037.20] But in the meantime,
[2037.66 → 2041.50] we are called then to those chasms and those divides
[2041.50 → 2042.90] and those raging waters.
[2043.18 → 2046.18] And we are called to build bridges over the divides
[2046.18 → 2049.20] wherever we can in Christ
[2049.20 → 2052.58] with sturdy cables.
[2052.66 → 2053.16] What cables?
[2053.58 → 2055.48] Sturdy cables of grace
[2055.48 → 2057.00] because we have to have so much grace for each other.
[2057.28 → 2059.02] And sturdy cables of truth
[2059.02 → 2062.78] because we have to find God's truth for our lives.
[2062.78 → 2064.78] We need both.
[2073.84 → 2075.38] We're going to have communion together
[2075.38 → 2077.12] as we have for the last number of weeks.
[2079.20 → 2080.42] And Jesus said,
[2080.42 → 2082.62] I am the way,
[2083.42 → 2084.28] the truth,
[2084.88 → 2085.48] and the life.
[2086.70 → 2087.40] And in Him,
[2087.46 → 2088.58] we are empowered then
[2088.58 → 2091.00] to build bridges over chaotic waters
[2091.00 → 2092.92] because He is the way.
[2093.60 → 2094.38] He is our way.
[2095.06 → 2096.32] And He has opened the way
[2096.32 → 2098.44] to overcoming relational differences.
[2099.10 → 2099.42] He said,
[2099.50 → 2099.86] in this world,
[2099.94 → 2100.72] you're going to have troubles,
[2100.80 → 2101.28] but take heart,
[2101.34 → 2102.08] I've overcome the world.
[2102.08 → 2104.76] And we might be crying out,
[2104.82 → 2104.92] well,
[2104.98 → 2105.84] I follow Paul
[2105.84 → 2106.88] and I follow Apollos
[2106.88 → 2107.84] and I follow Peter
[2107.84 → 2108.88] and I can fill up,
[2109.04 → 2110.64] I follow, and you can put in an issue
[2110.64 → 2111.88] or a name,
[2112.20 → 2113.14] I follow whatever,
[2113.24 → 2114.26] whatever that's about.
[2114.60 → 2115.74] And Paul then asks us,
[2115.94 → 2117.30] is Christ divided?
[2119.14 → 2120.26] And unequivocally,
[2120.38 → 2121.48] the answer is no.
[2123.56 → 2124.74] He's not divided.
[2127.54 → 2129.38] He is enough for everyone.
[2129.38 → 2133.06] And He gives Himself.
[2134.50 → 2135.84] He gives Himself
[2135.84 → 2138.32] to each one of us
[2138.32 → 2140.76] because He loves us
[2140.76 → 2143.90] and He wants us to love like Him.
[2147.58 → 2149.38] And then Jesus at that table
[2149.38 → 2151.28] took the wine, and He poured it
[2151.28 → 2151.64] and He said,
[2151.82 → 2152.58] this is my blood.
[2153.16 → 2155.50] This is my blood that cleans you
[2155.50 → 2158.32] because you need cleaning.
[2158.32 → 2159.84] Do you believe that?
[2162.84 → 2164.38] Do you believe you need
[2164.38 → 2165.24] to be cleaned up?
[2168.92 → 2170.58] Clean from all the brokenness,
[2170.96 → 2172.18] clean from all the division,
[2172.58 → 2173.98] clean from all the chaos,
[2174.84 → 2175.80] all the misunderstanding,
[2176.18 → 2177.10] all the finger pointing,
[2177.98 → 2180.06] all the angry words.
[2181.54 → 2182.12] I was reading a story
[2182.12 → 2182.80] about Martin Luther,
[2182.88 → 2183.70] the great reformer,
[2183.82 → 2184.22] and boy,
[2184.28 → 2185.46] that was a turmoil,
[2185.84 → 2186.76] a time of turmoil
[2186.76 → 2187.84] for the church,
[2187.94 → 2188.10] right,
[2188.16 → 2188.70] breaking away
[2188.70 → 2189.98] and arguments
[2189.98 → 2191.12] and people being killed
[2191.12 → 2191.76] over the stuff.
[2191.98 → 2192.48] And, you know,
[2192.60 → 2193.22] we always think
[2193.22 → 2194.04] our problems are big.
[2194.28 → 2195.64] Man, history is full
[2195.64 → 2196.36] of this kind of stuff,
[2196.60 → 2197.06] unfortunately.
[2197.40 → 2198.58] But he had a huge disagreement
[2198.58 → 2200.00] with one of his fellow reformers
[2200.00 → 2200.74] named Swing ley.
[2201.06 → 2202.20] And they had strong
[2202.20 → 2203.18] and hard words
[2203.18 → 2203.86] with each other
[2203.86 → 2205.34] and were battling
[2205.34 → 2206.02] over things.
[2206.20 → 2207.04] And finally,
[2207.14 → 2207.80] Luther said,
[2208.66 → 2210.16] and I say this to you as well,
[2210.42 → 2211.92] let us look to the future.
[2212.56 → 2213.14] What future?
[2213.80 → 2214.10] Well,
[2214.60 → 2216.56] there's no more tears.
[2217.70 → 2219.14] We will be all in Christ.
[2219.82 → 2220.20] We will be new heaven,
[2220.28 → 2220.60] new earth,
[2220.68 → 2221.16] all of that,
[2221.24 → 2221.90] some of that future.
[2222.28 → 2222.74] But he said,
[2223.04 → 2224.78] let's look to the future.
[2225.12 → 2226.22] If we cannot agree
[2226.22 → 2226.86] on everything,
[2227.02 → 2227.90] which is going to be true,
[2228.38 → 2229.46] we can at least
[2229.46 → 2230.96] enter fellowship together.
[2235.74 → 2236.94] When we share this,
[2237.48 → 2238.62] we share a meal together.
[2238.72 → 2239.06] I know it's,
[2239.24 → 2239.72] we're going to go
[2239.72 → 2240.40] to four corners
[2240.40 → 2240.96] and it doesn't feel
[2240.96 → 2241.66] like a meal together.
[2241.66 → 2243.00] But we share
[2243.00 → 2244.32] fundamental truth.
[2244.70 → 2246.94] We all need Christ
[2246.94 → 2250.92] in us
[2250.92 → 2254.24] so that we can
[2254.24 → 2255.54] live out
[2255.54 → 2256.68] his transformation
[2256.68 → 2257.32] in us
[2257.32 → 2258.38] and help bring the world
[2258.38 → 2259.40] to the transformation
[2259.40 → 2260.20] he longs for.
[2263.50 → 2264.42] I'm going to invite you
[2264.42 → 2265.18] to partake
[2265.18 → 2267.48] and to go to one of the tables
[2267.48 → 2268.34] and take the bread
[2268.34 → 2269.04] and take the juice
[2269.04 → 2269.80] to your seat.
[2269.80 → 2271.46] and then I want you
[2271.46 → 2273.04] to take and eat
[2273.04 → 2273.98] and drink
[2273.98 → 2274.96] and remember
[2274.96 → 2275.72] and believe
[2275.72 → 2277.04] that Jesus died
[2277.04 → 2277.86] and rose again
[2277.86 → 2278.96] so you and I
[2278.96 → 2281.02] could live resurrected lives
[2281.02 → 2282.34] in his power
[2282.34 → 2283.58] with unity.
[2285.02 → 2286.30] I invite the servers
[2286.30 → 2287.34] to come to the tables
[2287.34 → 2289.10] and I invite you
[2289.10 → 2289.80] to partake.
[2290.18 → 2291.14] But before that happens,
[2291.26 → 2291.92] let me pray.
[2292.00 → 2292.98] The servers can go to the table
[2292.98 → 2293.96] but let me pray right now.
[2293.96 → 2296.12] Father God,
[2296.18 → 2297.24] we come before you Lord
[2297.24 → 2297.46] and
[2297.46 → 2300.20] we thank you
[2300.20 → 2300.90] that you are
[2300.90 → 2301.80] a God
[2301.80 → 2302.78] who longs
[2302.78 → 2304.22] for your people
[2304.22 → 2304.88] to be one.
[2306.24 → 2307.80] You bind us together
[2307.80 → 2309.00] with your word,
[2309.30 → 2310.06] with your spirit.
[2310.80 → 2311.80] You bind us together
[2311.80 → 2312.72] with yourself.
[2314.04 → 2315.10] And may your love
[2315.10 → 2317.52] permeate our lives
[2317.52 → 2319.62] so that we can love well.
[2319.62 → 2321.22] Lord,
[2321.28 → 2321.74] forgive us
[2321.74 → 2323.28] for the messy way
[2323.28 → 2324.32] we handle divisions
[2324.32 → 2324.98] in our marriages
[2324.98 → 2325.68] and our families
[2325.68 → 2326.26] and our churches
[2326.26 → 2326.94] and our schools
[2326.94 → 2328.00] and all around us
[2328.00 → 2328.68] in our society.
[2329.64 → 2329.96] Lord,
[2330.06 → 2331.44] might we be peacemakers.
[2332.48 → 2334.14] Might we be more like you.
[2335.20 → 2336.32] And might we be a blessing
[2336.32 → 2337.34] to those around us
[2337.34 → 2338.62] because we know you.
[2338.98 → 2339.62] Amen.
[2352.18 → 2352.74] Amen.
[2353.26 → 2353.34] Jackie.
