[0.00 → 21.44] Today, we are carrying on with our look at something called the Beatitudes.
[22.48 → 26.16] The Beatitudes are out of Matthew 5.
[26.16 → 33.38] And I was reading one writer, and that's why we have this series called The Way of Blessing.
[33.70 → 41.28] But I was reading one writer talking about the Beatitudes, the blessed are things about becoming like Christ.
[41.62 → 45.24] It's all about the character of Christ and us wanting to be like Him.
[45.62 → 46.76] I thought that was kind of interesting.
[47.12 → 49.26] That our character changes.
[50.66 → 52.40] And then he went on to talk about change.
[52.40 → 60.82] And he made reference to moral reformation, which is versus spiritual transformation.
[61.02 → 65.28] And moral improvement, in a way, is this common virtue thing.
[65.56 → 65.70] Right?
[65.78 → 67.68] We like honesty and generosity.
[67.88 → 69.72] We like the rules to keep us straight.
[70.04 → 71.08] We want to be good citizens.
[71.74 → 74.88] That's not what the Beatitude is moving toward.
[74.88 → 83.26] The Beatitudes are about what we might call instead of common virtue, true virtue, spiritual transformation, getting to the root of things.
[84.36 → 89.02] Not so much looking at rules, but instead really looking at the ruler.
[89.44 → 91.80] Who is the ruler of our lives?
[93.82 → 102.16] And this is about fixing our eyes, therefore, on Jesus, on His character, on His spirit, on His love, on His patience, on His forgiveness, on His mercy.
[102.60 → 104.48] And then we come to today's Beatitudes.
[104.48 → 105.40] So let's read that.
[105.70 → 109.16] I'm going to start from the beginning of our passage and where we got up to now.
[109.64 → 110.78] And so let me read it to you.
[110.94 → 111.74] Matthew 5.
[112.96 → 116.90] Now when Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountainside and He sat down.
[117.04 → 119.76] His disciples came to Him, and He began to teach them.
[120.66 → 124.30] Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[124.90 → 127.44] Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[128.24 → 131.60] Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
[132.22 → 133.80] And that's what we're going to talk about today.
[134.48 → 135.58] Being meek.
[137.10 → 139.58] Where Jesus' spirit changes our spirit.
[139.70 → 141.90] Where we're not merely restrained, but actually changed.
[142.22 → 146.76] But you know, when you read this, when you read these Beatitudes and you say meekness, you might say, really?
[147.26 → 147.70] Meekness?
[147.70 → 150.18] This is what we're going after.
[150.30 → 151.20] This is what Jesus is.
[151.54 → 154.56] And we kind of think of doormats or spineless.
[155.18 → 155.34] Right?
[155.50 → 155.92] Meekness.
[156.04 → 157.74] Of course it rhymes with weakness.
[158.30 → 158.46] Right?
[158.56 → 160.06] It seems to long together.
[160.54 → 163.14] But that's not what we're talking about here.
[164.14 → 165.58] Blessed are the meek.
[165.64 → 166.52] And then what does it say?
[166.88 → 172.62] For they shall be cared for, for they shall be comforted, because they get beat up in life a lot, because they're really, really anxious people.
[172.62 → 174.40] It doesn't say that.
[175.14 → 178.40] Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
[180.52 → 181.50] That sounds good.
[182.92 → 183.84] That sounds good.
[183.90 → 185.16] That doesn't sound weak.
[185.16 → 193.62] This word meek, in Scripture, it kind of gets interchanged with gentleness and with the word humility.
[194.06 → 198.28] Look at what Paul writes in Galatians 5, where he's talking about the fruit of the Spirit.
[198.36 → 200.74] So if the Holy Spirit is in you, what comes out?
[201.10 → 209.88] The Holy Spirit, and we read in Paul's words here, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness.
[210.06 → 210.60] And here we go.
[210.80 → 211.62] Here's the word meek.
[211.62 → 241.60] Here's the word meek.
[241.62 → 242.68] Here's the word meek.
[242.68 → 243.62] Here's the word meek.
[243.62 → 244.04] Here's the word meek.
[244.04 → 244.62] Here's the word meek.
[244.62 → 245.62] Here's the word meek.
[245.62 → 247.62] Here's the word meek.
[249.04 → 251.38] So Jesus is meek.
[252.92 → 259.02] And he says you'll never learn to rest unless you learn to be meek as I am.
[260.56 → 264.70] We obviously, I know for me, don't understand meekness very well.
[264.98 → 267.10] The word has been hijacked to mean other things.
[267.10 → 274.04] So I thought, why don't we do a case study out of Jesus' life that might help us better understand how this gets played out.
[274.50 → 277.52] And I take the passage from John 8, verse 1 through 11.
[277.88 → 287.32] This is a story of a woman caught in adultery, and the leaders of the community bring this woman forward to trap Jesus.
[287.40 → 288.48] So let's read it together.
[289.88 → 291.08] John 8, 1-11.
[291.08 → 300.22] But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives, and at dawn he appeared again in the temple courts where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.
[301.36 → 305.68] The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery.
[306.70 → 309.56] They made her stand before the group.
[309.74 → 310.30] Imagine that.
[311.50 → 316.38] And they said to Jesus, teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
[316.38 → 322.48] In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.
[323.56 → 325.00] Now, what do you say?
[325.80 → 331.54] And they were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.
[333.04 → 334.10] Notice Jesus' response.
[335.28 → 338.80] Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.
[338.80 → 343.78] When they kept questioning him, he straightened up, and he said to them,
[344.70 → 348.56] Yeah, let anyone who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.
[350.40 → 353.54] Again, he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
[355.54 → 362.40] At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first,
[363.02 → 367.10] until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there.
[367.10 → 369.74] Jesus straightened up and asked her,
[369.80 → 371.52] Woman, where are they?
[371.58 → 372.76] Has no one condemned you?
[373.88 → 375.44] No one, sir, she said.
[376.44 → 378.00] Then neither do I condemn you.
[379.26 → 380.20] And Jesus declared,
[381.06 → 385.46] Now go and leave your life without sin.
[388.48 → 393.08] We see this religious leaders here setting a trap for Jesus.
[394.10 → 396.38] If he says, let her go, he breaks the law.
[397.10 → 400.66] If he says, punish her, well, so much for all his talk on grace.
[402.14 → 403.26] Loses either way.
[403.84 → 405.42] And then he might as well say, well, I'm meek.
[405.64 → 408.44] Come all to me who are weary and sinners, and I'll have you executed.
[409.66 → 411.42] And that feels like a whole different story, doesn't it?
[411.82 → 413.82] Trample her or trample the law.
[414.02 → 415.58] Those seem to be the choices.
[415.58 → 422.58] Jesus shows us, though, something about the power of meekness, of humility, of gentleness.
[424.04 → 426.28] He's reading something about paired polarities.
[427.06 → 429.06] Two things that don't seem to go together.
[429.42 → 431.24] Jesus, in the gospel, we have that often.
[431.64 → 434.92] Power, meekness, paired polarities.
[434.92 → 435.52] Gentleness.
[435.88 → 438.96] The gospel pairs difficult things with the character of Jesus.
[439.44 → 441.68] Gentleness with incredible bravery.
[442.84 → 443.54] Let me say this.
[443.76 → 447.56] If you are gentle and not brave, or brave and not gentle, you're not humble.
[449.04 → 449.92] You're not humble.
[450.78 → 455.88] Notice how Jesus does not treat this woman as if she's beneath him and his attention.
[455.88 → 457.80] As the crowd is doing.
[457.90 → 458.60] They humiliate her.
[458.68 → 459.26] They scorn her.
[460.02 → 465.66] If you have humility, if you have weakness, you're never haughty toward people.
[466.76 → 469.44] You don't have to look down or talk down to anyone.
[471.62 → 476.78] When you deal with someone who is in a hard place, in a lowly place like this woman,
[477.08 → 480.98] caught in wrong choices, you are as gentle as Jesus is.
[480.98 → 485.58] Because followers of Jesus ought to be humble, meek, gentle.
[485.88 → 490.90] Sad to say, I often don't see that.
[493.14 → 499.48] He even creates space for the accusers to reconsider their tone and motives, to wake them up.
[501.52 → 505.02] It's why later on we see Jesus washing Judas, the betrayer's feet.
[505.26 → 509.34] It's why we see Jesus forgiving those who are on the cross, or who put him on the cross.
[509.34 → 514.38] And this gentleness, this meekness, it's brave meekness.
[515.88 → 518.66] We talk about polarity.
[518.66 → 519.66] Brave meekness.
[519.66 → 523.14] You know, I love that in this tense moment.
[523.14 → 523.98] Imagine it.
[523.98 → 525.14] He's doodling in the dirt.
[525.14 → 528.98] There's lots of debate sometimes about what was he drawing?
[528.98 → 530.56] And there are all kinds of thoughts about that.
[530.56 → 540.52] But what you really see is someone who is in control, poised, unflappable, meek, saying even with his body language, I'm meek in a powerful way.
[540.52 → 541.18] Powerful way.
[544.58 → 546.64] Because who's controlling this whole story?
[549.28 → 550.98] Enormous power under control.
[551.42 → 555.36] Meek, it comes from a Greek word, prowess, P-R-A-U-S, prowess.
[555.98 → 562.22] It comes from a word that means some powerful animal like a horse that's submissive to a rider.
[562.98 → 564.12] That's meekness.
[564.12 → 566.66] Jesus didn't give up his power and greatness.
[566.94 → 572.76] At one point he says, I could command angels to come down and deal with you all, but I don't.
[573.68 → 574.66] I'm not gonna.
[575.28 → 576.78] But he does surrender.
[576.92 → 580.84] He does submit to the will of the Father in order to bring about our salvation.
[580.84 → 592.00] You aren't meek and humble in a real true sense of the word without being fearless because of your trust of the Father.
[593.82 → 595.64] Not because you trust yourself.
[595.74 → 596.80] No, because you trust the Father.
[597.68 → 598.28] It's interesting.
[598.78 → 608.92] In Scripture, the term meekness was also, it wasn't, it was talked about sometimes, but it wasn't attached to individual people except, I think I read this right somewhere.
[608.92 → 611.92] With Jesus and then the Old Testament with Moses.
[612.14 → 616.96] In Numbers we read, now Moses was a meek man above anyone else on earth.
[617.24 → 617.50] What?
[617.78 → 618.12] Wait a minute.
[618.96 → 623.04] Moses was a meek man and then he somehow, that makes him above.
[623.86 → 625.30] And I was thinking about Moses, right?
[625.34 → 626.68] It's interesting to me that there's Moses.
[627.10 → 629.84] He goes to Pharaoh, the most powerful man on the planet.
[629.84 → 640.28] And he goes in, and he says, Pharaoh, want all the slaves freed so you can ruin your economy and do it snappy because God Almighty says so.
[642.24 → 642.64] Whoa.
[643.48 → 644.64] You said that to that guy?
[644.78 → 645.60] He could kill you.
[645.70 → 646.02] Yeah, no.
[646.74 → 648.64] My confidence is in the power of the Lord.
[649.06 → 652.28] And then we know the story of the ten plagues, and we see God's power at work.
[652.28 → 655.40] In Scripture, the meek are strong.
[656.18 → 656.50] How?
[657.18 → 660.66] Because meekness isn't thinking less of yourself.
[661.64 → 663.62] Jesus never says, well, who am I to say?
[663.84 → 666.64] Jesus says, I say unto you.
[669.50 → 673.02] And then he speaks what he knows is on the Father's heart.
[675.18 → 677.96] He became as nothing in order to overcome sin and death.
[678.10 → 678.74] And that's not nothing.
[678.74 → 678.82] Nothing.
[682.28 → 686.84] Many of us feel inferior and therefore act aggressively to compensate.
[688.78 → 692.98] You have to win the argument because otherwise you're the loser.
[693.50 → 695.16] And that's already how you feel about yourself.
[695.40 → 696.80] So that's unacceptable.
[698.66 → 700.14] Jesus was willing to lose.
[701.26 → 703.90] And ironically, that's his pathway to victory often.
[704.66 → 706.68] The meek will inherit the earth.
[707.78 → 710.06] Real meekness isn't thinking less of yourself.
[710.06 → 711.78] It's thinking about yourself less.
[712.58 → 715.14] Because you're free from not having to think about yourself.
[715.52 → 717.88] Utter freedom from having to feed your ego.
[718.50 → 721.10] And that rids you of self-righteousness and arrogance.
[721.68 → 723.16] And it rids you of cowardice.
[723.96 → 727.68] C.S. Lewis talked about this obsession of self.
[727.80 → 731.10] He said, this unsmiling concentration on self.
[731.86 → 734.36] I thought that, yeah, unsmiling concentration of self.
[734.56 → 737.18] You're just so self-absorbed in different ways.
[737.18 → 741.32] I believe this is why we have so many divisions take place.
[742.82 → 745.66] Why we are often such a fractured people.
[746.16 → 751.00] Because we live by my thoughts, my opinions, my ideas.
[753.00 → 754.70] Me, me, me.
[754.70 → 761.46] I tried this in the first service, but nobody did remember it.
[761.66 → 763.02] You remember the movie Short Circuit?
[763.14 → 763.54] Anyone here?
[764.94 → 765.54] Ah, there we go.
[765.58 → 765.96] There's a few.
[766.10 → 766.48] Thank you.
[766.64 → 767.54] I thought it was just me.
[767.54 → 771.50] Anyway, there's this movie about this robot.
[772.26 → 774.86] And this robot is hungry for information.
[775.02 → 775.74] It wants to learn.
[776.00 → 776.64] Give me information.
[776.92 → 780.18] And it's always saying, input, input, input, input, input.
[780.34 → 780.78] Give it a book.
[780.88 → 781.60] Input, input.
[782.02 → 782.64] It's doing this.
[782.92 → 783.52] That's what it's doing.
[783.84 → 784.86] But it made me think that way.
[785.54 → 786.20] That's us.
[787.04 → 787.78] With our egos.
[788.16 → 788.32] Right?
[788.70 → 788.88] Yeah.
[789.22 → 789.92] Input, input.
[790.18 → 791.72] My ego needs to be boosted.
[791.92 → 793.44] I need to have my confidence build up.
[793.62 → 795.08] I need affirmation that I'm right.
[795.08 → 797.74] I need to have compliments because I'm feeling inferior.
[798.36 → 799.40] Input, input, input.
[804.06 → 806.40] And people like that are often upset.
[807.94 → 809.28] Always getting their feelings hurt.
[811.10 → 811.64] Meekness.
[812.18 → 816.18] You're free from that unsmiling concentration of oneself.
[819.16 → 823.30] Jesus isn't a conflict enjoyer or a conflict avoider.
[823.30 → 828.72] Remember, one sign you're not humble or meek is when you enjoy conflict or avoid conflict.
[829.44 → 833.30] Jesus amazingly deals with these men, these teachers and Pharisees.
[833.54 → 836.50] Yet at the same time, he caringly deals with this woman too.
[837.94 → 845.92] And if you love conflict, it's likely because it's your job to correct everyone.
[845.92 → 849.54] And you tend to get everyone riled up.
[850.88 → 854.40] And if you're afraid, if you avoid conflict, it's likely you're afraid.
[854.50 → 855.38] Afraid of failing.
[855.70 → 856.44] Afraid of being attacked.
[856.66 → 857.42] What will this do to me?
[857.60 → 859.74] And you're deeply focused on yourself too.
[860.04 → 864.98] And neither side has understood Christ's character and his gift of meekness.
[865.74 → 869.34] Because both are too busy looking at themselves.
[869.34 → 878.58] If you want to know if you're meek and humble, take note of your reactions to three particular areas.
[879.72 → 880.86] Criticism or opposition.
[881.74 → 883.50] Advice and thanks.
[883.50 → 892.70] Think of when you face criticism or opposition.
[894.70 → 899.22] Either you might be indifferent to it or you might be devastated by it.
[900.28 → 903.48] If you're indifferent, it's your pride at work.
[903.70 → 906.06] I don't care what anyone else thinks because I'm right.
[906.32 → 907.40] And you're not teachable.
[908.32 → 911.62] If you're devastated, you can't stop looking at yourself.
[911.98 → 913.42] You need approval all the time.
[914.22 → 916.34] Either way, you're self-absorbed.
[917.62 → 918.94] Response to advice.
[919.38 → 922.40] If you're totally inflexible or totally flexible.
[923.10 → 930.34] If you need advice all the time in order to make a move, you need everyone to think you're okay all the time.
[932.50 → 933.80] Or you could be inflexible.
[933.98 → 937.46] Jonathan Edwards, a Pilgrim's Progress guy, he said this.
[937.46 → 941.88] The sure sign you're not humble is a Christian sure of everything all the time.
[941.88 → 944.20] In regard to Christian beliefs, theology, and thinking.
[944.50 → 945.58] I'm always sure.
[945.76 → 946.76] I'm always right.
[947.04 → 948.48] I never could be wrong.
[950.32 → 954.26] That's a sign that you are inflexible.
[955.60 → 956.36] It's not healthy.
[957.44 → 958.48] Response to thank.
[959.36 → 961.46] Someone thanks you, and you can't bear it.
[961.60 → 962.64] You almost want to go hide.
[962.64 → 966.62] Or you've got to be thanked all the time.
[966.86 → 967.92] And if you're not, you're upset.
[968.20 → 970.36] You might even quit because you're not being noticed enough.
[972.74 → 974.56] Back to Jesus and the woman.
[975.06 → 976.36] Now it's just them.
[976.36 → 984.84] Jesus says, so as no one condemned you, well then neither do I condemn you.
[985.86 → 989.32] And then he says, now leave your life of sin.
[991.74 → 994.44] Notice Jesus honours the law.
[995.16 → 1003.44] If you were to be a witness, as these guys claimed, right, they had to have actually seen the adultery act in progress.
[1003.44 → 1008.90] There had to be a couple of them, and they had to drag the guilty person out because they saw it.
[1008.92 → 1010.06] But here's the problem though.
[1010.10 → 1014.40] If you were going to be a witness, then you also had to be present at the execution, thus the stoning here.
[1014.80 → 1018.92] And you cannot be guilty of the same crime.
[1018.92 → 1025.46] Now hear Jesus' words.
[1026.26 → 1032.72] Anyone who looks at a woman lustfully commits adultery.
[1034.50 → 1037.34] I can't be a witness.
[1039.04 → 1040.20] I'm guilty too.
[1041.40 → 1044.14] And notice who's absent in this story.
[1045.96 → 1046.90] There's the woman.
[1046.90 → 1049.62] Apparently he takes two to tango.
[1051.94 → 1052.74] Where's he?
[1054.26 → 1055.52] How's that right?
[1058.04 → 1065.92] And so Jesus, knowing all of that, Jesus sits there drawing in the sand.
[1067.36 → 1069.02] Anyone without sin, throw the first stone.
[1069.10 → 1070.14] Notice who leaves first.
[1070.14 → 1078.04] It's the older ones because they know if they take a good look at their long lives, there's plenty to condemn as well.
[1078.62 → 1079.98] And pretty soon all leave.
[1081.02 → 1085.56] And Jesus says, I could condemn you, but I'm not gonna.
[1087.02 → 1089.44] But he does say this is sin.
[1089.98 → 1090.98] It harms you.
[1091.18 → 1092.16] It harms others.
[1092.16 → 1093.74] So stop it.
[1097.46 → 1099.94] Now, there's a problem here.
[1100.44 → 1106.72] Because how do we have guilt without consequences, without things being made right?
[1107.06 → 1109.86] Is Jesus just saying, well, here's the carpet.
[1110.38 → 1111.16] Here's your sin.
[1111.28 → 1112.00] Whoop, whoop, whoop.
[1112.22 → 1112.80] All done.
[1112.86 → 1113.52] Under the carpet.
[1113.72 → 1114.24] I'm done.
[1115.14 → 1116.56] He's not doing that.
[1116.56 → 1120.80] Because of the cross.
[1122.60 → 1129.06] One of the reasons I think it's hard for us to be humble and meek is that we are either moral or gracious.
[1131.46 → 1132.58] It seems either or.
[1133.00 → 1138.64] We either trample on people or we trample on God's law, his ways to healthy living, his way to good life.
[1138.64 → 1141.00] We find it hard to do both.
[1141.40 → 1142.92] Jesus does both.
[1144.50 → 1146.48] He is without sin.
[1146.80 → 1148.90] He could cast stones, but he doesn't.
[1149.16 → 1151.74] But he does not simply ignore the sinner sweeping under the carpet.
[1152.00 → 1155.10] Because he is holy, and it must be dealt with.
[1155.44 → 1160.20] And he is therefore condemned for all of us.
[1161.70 → 1162.80] And we read Romans 8.
[1163.08 → 1163.70] Look at it with me.
[1164.66 → 1170.86] Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[1170.86 → 1178.32] Because through Christ Jesus, the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[1179.32 → 1183.10] So we are guilty and not condemned.
[1183.10 → 1186.64] That ought to keep us humble.
[1186.64 → 1190.20] That ought to keep us balanced.
[1190.64 → 1194.92] Grace matters, but so does God's truth and God's law.
[1195.48 → 1200.38] And this beatitude is at the heart of being like Christ, of taking on his character.
[1200.38 → 1208.48] We need to stop worrying and being so anxious about being good enough to have God's love because we aren't.
[1208.98 → 1215.14] But we also need to be so sloppy and so angry at everyone who isn't good enough just like you.
[1215.14 → 1228.04] It's ironic to me, and it's interesting to me that humility and meekness and gentleness actually lead to joy
[1228.04 → 1235.50] because I live with Christ's mercy on display all the time.
[1238.08 → 1243.82] I become, and then I become more and more like him, and therefore I'm merciful.
[1245.14 → 1247.28] Realizing I still need grace all the time.
[1247.68 → 1250.84] And that brings freedom and that brings joy.
[1252.58 → 1253.58] Let me ask you this.
[1253.78 → 1255.72] Do you think this woman understood it all?
[1257.70 → 1258.94] Was she getting the whole story here?
[1259.10 → 1260.82] I mean, not a chance.
[1261.72 → 1262.58] Not a chance.
[1262.68 → 1264.24] Jesus hadn't even died and rose again.
[1264.60 → 1268.26] Jesus constantly loves people who have no idea.
[1272.32 → 1273.66] Let me ask you this.
[1273.66 → 1277.80] Are you ready to give up on your pride for those who don't get it?
[1280.22 → 1284.30] To love them because being meek and humble is about loving.
[1286.12 → 1288.30] Because you're loved like that by Jesus.
[1289.10 → 1290.40] And notice the order.
[1291.26 → 1293.18] Neither do I condemn you.
[1294.04 → 1294.98] Now go sin no more.
[1295.68 → 1297.42] He didn't do it the other way around.
[1297.66 → 1299.78] He didn't say, okay, go sin no more.
[1299.78 → 1302.80] Come back in about a year, and then I won't condemn you.
[1303.38 → 1304.78] That's not how this goes here.
[1305.96 → 1312.10] God didn't give the Israelites the Ten Commandments while they were still in Egypt and say, okay, there you go.
[1312.42 → 1314.02] That's how you get out of Egypt.
[1314.56 → 1315.58] Obey all these things.
[1315.82 → 1316.64] Then you're out.
[1317.24 → 1318.62] No, he frees the slaves.
[1318.88 → 1322.98] And then he gives them the Ten Commandments to show them how life works best.
[1322.98 → 1326.86] We get the order back all the time.
[1327.12 → 1334.44] If you have an enslaving habit, whatever that might be, an enslaving habit, something that you keep tripping over,
[1335.10 → 1339.70] and you say, well, you know, if I get rid of this, then God will love me.
[1339.70 → 1344.60] Well, you've messed up the order.
[1346.44 → 1353.54] You'll never get free then, because your only motive is fear, and fear is never enough.
[1353.98 → 1355.44] It's not strong enough.
[1356.84 → 1359.74] You get grace before overcoming sin.
[1361.10 → 1362.92] So first, no condemnation.
[1363.72 → 1367.10] Then change and transformation through the power of God at work in you.
[1367.10 → 1372.16] And again, this ought to keep us humble and meek and gentle.
[1372.74 → 1377.32] Like the woman, when it's just you and Jesus in the room.
[1380.14 → 1388.66] And he looks at you, and he says, is there anything condemning and accusing you?
[1391.12 → 1392.50] Something come to mind?
[1394.66 → 1396.10] And then he says, let it go.
[1397.10 → 1398.68] Because I'm here.
[1400.12 → 1401.26] And I don't condemn you.
[1403.64 → 1410.48] And then he says, now, go live life the way I designed life to be lived, with my ways and by my power,
[1411.00 → 1413.68] because that's my grace and goodness to you as well.
[1416.16 → 1416.96] We need both.
[1418.24 → 1418.86] Let's pray.
[1418.86 → 1429.96] Father God, we are so grateful that you are a God who is meek.
[1429.96 → 1439.36] Lord, forgive us for not being particularly meek people, or for not understanding what meekness is really all about.
[1439.68 → 1443.32] Forgive us for not being gentle, but rather being harsh.
[1443.60 → 1451.42] Forgive us for a lack of humility where we think too highly of our own opinions, and expressing them, and shooting them from the hip.
[1451.42 → 1452.42] Lord, forgive us for not being selfish.
[1452.42 → 1453.42] Lord, forgive us for not being selfish.
[1453.42 → 1456.90] And we reject others because they're not thinking like us.
[1457.96 → 1462.12] Well, they're wrong, so I can't accept them anymore.
[1463.88 → 1465.22] Lord, forgive us for that.
[1465.64 → 1467.28] Forgive us for our lack of meekness.
[1468.62 → 1469.92] Our ungentleness.
[1469.92 → 1475.50] Lord, might we become more like you.
[1477.28 → 1479.02] Thank you for your mercy.
[1479.86 → 1481.48] May we in turn show mercy.
[1482.18 → 1483.54] Thank you for your grace.
[1483.68 → 1485.28] May we in turn be gracious.
[1485.84 → 1491.64] And thank you that you invite us into healthy life so that we may indeed know your will and live it out.
[1492.46 → 1493.76] May we share that with others too.
[1494.26 → 1495.78] In Jesus' name, amen.
