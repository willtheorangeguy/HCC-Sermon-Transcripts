[0.00 → 0.90] Amen. You may be seated.
[8.82 → 12.24] Well, as we've already mentioned, today's a special day when we get to celebrate
[12.24 → 17.32] Jonathan Huang becoming a minister of the Word in the Christian Reformed Church.
[18.72 → 22.28] And I know for a lot of us, you're probably feeling, if you've been around Hope,
[22.34 → 24.18] you'll know that Jonathan's been here for a while.
[24.86 → 28.84] Jonathan came to Hope in the middle of 2020 as a regent intern,
[28.84 → 31.44] and he basically said, how can I serve?
[31.56 → 33.96] And if you remember, 2020 was the middle of the pandemic.
[34.58 → 36.10] So we just put Jonathan to work.
[36.44 → 39.84] We got him serving with youth, with young adults, with worship ministry,
[40.06 → 44.42] serving at the Coverdale Community Kitchen, and we fell in love with this guy right away.
[44.92 → 47.24] We saw his gifts. We saw his servant heart.
[47.96 → 51.24] And as his internship continued, we saw his gifts deepen.
[51.82 → 55.62] And when his internship was coming to close, all the leaders were getting together saying,
[55.62 → 57.28] okay, how do we hold on to this guy?
[57.28 → 59.60] We know that Sid will eventually retire.
[59.80 → 62.84] We want someone who's coming up who's younger than Sid, no offence to Sid,
[63.46 → 65.76] who will be able to serve this church in years to come.
[65.94 → 69.92] And so here we are celebrating your gifts, Jonathan, into ministry,
[70.54 → 73.24] and the gift you've been to our church in ministry.
[74.94 → 77.20] I want to invite you up to the stage along with Moon.
[77.96 → 79.30] I'm going to say a few words,
[79.78 → 82.60] and I'm going to have some other people come up to say a few words as well.
[82.60 → 87.14] And people are fighting over who gets to hold their kids.
[94.54 → 97.92] We really do see it as a gift that God brought you to our church.
[98.72 → 100.96] I said this in the 9 a.m. service, and I'll say it again.
[101.12 → 104.96] It would have been easier, Jonathan and Moon, I know, for you, growing up in Korean churches,
[105.16 → 108.00] it would have been easier to be in a Korean-speaking church.
[108.00 → 112.98] And God led you to our church, and I think he's used you as a gift in deepening us in many ways,
[113.04 → 114.46] even as a multi-ethnic church.
[115.22 → 117.52] But we reflect this morning on Ephesians 4,
[118.72 → 122.58] where Christ's love for the church is so great that he raises up new leaders in every generation.
[123.34 → 127.46] It says in Ephesians 4 that he gave apostles and prophets, evangelists, and pastors
[127.46 → 129.48] to equip the church for works of service,
[129.68 → 132.94] so that the body of Christ, us, may be built up.
[132.94 → 137.06] And here we are, recognizing that Christ has done that in our particular church,
[137.52 → 140.60] right here, by bringing the two of you into our community.
[142.20 → 146.88] I was going to spend awhile speaking about how the scriptures teach on the vocation of a pastor.
[147.58 → 151.30] What I've decided to do instead is ask different people from our wider church body
[151.30 → 153.96] to come up to the stage and to give you a gift,
[154.50 → 158.14] a gift that represents different dimensions of the pastoring vocation.
[158.30 → 160.92] So I'm going to start by inviting Marcus Other.
[160.92 → 164.90] He's going to come up and share first, and then the others will come up after him.
[175.08 → 175.56] Hello.
[176.20 → 177.22] My name is Marcus.
[178.40 → 184.02] I'm a young adult who has worked alongside Jonathan in the young adults' ministry
[184.02 → 186.00] and in other areas.
[186.00 → 192.56] I've got to, in my time with him, I've got to see his character, his true nature,
[192.94 → 195.50] and his passion in everything that he does.
[197.58 → 202.96] He's been a great pillar for me, and I've seen him be a pillar in the church.
[202.96 → 214.80] I want to present to you this Bible as it represents the importance of your continued ministry as a pastor
[214.80 → 216.98] in this church and in your life.
[218.28 → 228.06] I pray that your marriage, your life, your ministry be blessed as you continue on in every facet.
[228.06 → 230.22] Thank you so much.
[243.66 → 244.06] Hello.
[244.14 → 245.26] My name is Andre Van Rake.
[245.96 → 251.94] On behalf of council, I want to congratulate you, and I want to thank you.
[251.94 → 258.70] You are an answer to our prayers, as Dave mentioned, during COVID when you guys came here,
[258.86 → 262.88] and as other churches were, yeah, struggling.
[263.48 → 264.78] We added people.
[265.90 → 270.60] And it's been a great pleasure to see you grow here.
[271.36 → 274.12] And as I said, you've been an answer to prayer.
[274.12 → 279.66] And we look forward to working with you, you and Moon, for the years to come.
[280.84 → 283.12] My gift is...
[287.12 → 290.58] Oh, I shouldn't.
[290.58 → 303.98] A prayer bench.
[304.78 → 305.18] Yes.
[307.48 → 312.64] Prayer, obviously, needs to be the centre of our life with Christ.
[312.64 → 319.44] And as Dave will preach about in the future, that he's the centre of our lives.
[319.58 → 322.12] And so that we can look to you, both of you.
[322.28 → 323.44] I guess that's for both of you.
[323.76 → 324.46] Use it well.
[325.24 → 332.34] And through good times and tough times, especially tough times, God will be there with you.
[332.38 → 342.04] And as you kneel down with that posture, and yeah, continue to keep him and your relationship with God.
[342.04 → 343.10] God at the centre.
[343.30 → 344.84] And we will all be blessed from that.
[345.12 → 345.56] Thank you.
[360.14 → 361.76] Good morning, Jonathan and Moon.
[362.02 → 365.68] I'm Florence Bugling, and I'm speaking on behalf of the deacons in our church.
[365.68 → 373.62] And we are presenting you with this white towel, with a scripture verse, John 13, verse 15, inscribed on it.
[374.56 → 379.84] For I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.
[380.82 → 384.70] And these are the words that Jesus spoke after washing the disciples' feet.
[386.02 → 390.84] Symbolically, washing the feet of others is what it means to be a pastor at Hope Community.
[390.84 → 394.64] And we are looking forward to being in ministry together with you both.
[397.10 → 397.30] Thank you.
[401.30 → 411.78] Good morning, everybody.
[411.90 → 417.12] My name is Ed Gerber, and I'm representing the broader church, the Christian Reformed community.
[417.12 → 418.80] And there's a good reason for that.
[418.94 → 421.36] It is funny how things turn out, isn't it, Jonathan?
[422.28 → 430.82] So a little backstory is Mr. Huang, I was working for the classical leadership team where we recruit people.
[430.94 → 435.52] And if people want to become a pastor in the CRC church, then they would come and talk to me.
[435.74 → 439.96] And so I heard that a Mr. Huang wanted to become a member of the Christian Reformed church.
[439.96 → 447.20] And so I found out the name of the church, went online, and I thought, I'm going to check this guy out, you know, see who wants to come into our church.
[447.66 → 451.46] And so I started listening to a sermon that was there online in video format.
[451.60 → 454.30] I thought, wow, this guy's really young.
[455.06 → 457.76] And he loves God's Word, that's clear.
[457.84 → 460.12] And he's a really great teacher, so that's wonderful.
[460.76 → 462.44] So very excited to meet him.
[462.44 → 468.06] And then a little while later, Jonathan and his father came into my office.
[468.28 → 472.08] It was his father who was the one who was wanting to come into the church.
[472.20 → 477.00] And Jonathan came, I think, to help with some interpretation and translation.
[477.64 → 482.88] And then I, you know, talked to Mr. Huang, Samuel, and I worked with him.
[482.94 → 487.00] But then I went to Jonathan and said, hey, you know, what are your plans for the future?
[487.00 → 493.82] And so to make a long story short, Jonathan, your standing here today is a delight to my heart.
[494.56 → 496.98] I've been asked to give you a shepherd's staff.
[497.74 → 500.12] Why a shepherd's staff or a shepherd's crook?
[500.98 → 504.76] Well, and what is it mean to be a shepherd of God's church?
[505.80 → 507.84] You may remember that in Ezekiel.
[508.68 → 512.14] The shepherds have led God's people astray.
[512.14 → 517.74] Because, as Ezekiel says, they feed themselves rather than feeding God's people.
[518.18 → 521.14] And so in Ezekiel 34, God says to them,
[522.26 → 529.18] I myself, he makes the promise, will one day go and seek and find those who are lost in Israel
[529.18 → 534.44] because of the false teaching, because of those shepherds who feed themselves rather than the flock.
[534.78 → 539.58] And do not follow my blueprint for flourishing, but follow their own way.
[539.58 → 542.74] So I'm going to come, and I'm going to be their shepherd.
[543.26 → 546.86] And then when Jesus comes on the scene, you'll remember in John chapter 10, Jesus says what?
[547.28 → 548.66] I am the good shepherd.
[549.46 → 551.14] I am the gate for the sheep.
[551.24 → 552.06] The gate to what?
[552.62 → 556.90] The gate into that flourishing life that only comes through relationship with God
[556.90 → 560.56] and adherence to his way rather than our way.
[560.68 → 562.74] Jesus says, I am the way.
[563.28 → 564.94] And then at the end of John's gospel,
[565.90 → 569.34] Peter comes to Jesus after the resurrection.
[570.12 → 571.62] And Jesus says, Peter, do you love me?
[572.44 → 573.96] He says, Lord, you know that I love you.
[574.66 → 575.34] Feed my sheep.
[576.66 → 577.66] Peter, do you love me?
[578.42 → 579.58] Yes, Lord, you know I love you.
[579.70 → 580.40] Feed my sheep.
[581.20 → 583.12] And the third time he says it again.
[583.54 → 586.30] And Jesus replies, feed my sheep.
[587.22 → 589.72] He's not asking Peter to start a grocery chain.
[589.72 → 602.04] He's asking Peter and all those who will follow as leaders in the church to keep the word at the centre of the church's life.
[602.04 → 605.42] Because this is the way to life.
[605.42 → 608.72] It's to follow God's way instead of our own way.
[608.86 → 621.32] So I want to read you an exhortation from 1 Timothy where Paul encourages Timothy in a very challenging world to stay on the path as a good shepherd or as a good minister of the word.
[621.32 → 624.78] So if you want to grab this, then I can actually open my Bible.
[624.78 → 627.78] So hear this exhortation.
[627.78 → 635.56] The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.
[636.42 → 641.78] Such teachings come through hypocritical liars whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.
[641.78 → 649.18] If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good shepherd, a good minister of Christ Jesus.
[649.80 → 653.44] Nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.
[653.80 → 657.62] Have nothing to do with godless myths, old wives' tales.
[658.00 → 660.42] Rather, train yourself, Jonathan, to be godly.
[661.00 → 666.08] For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things.
[666.34 → 669.52] Holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
[669.52 → 672.94] This is a trustworthy saying and deserves full acceptance.
[673.66 → 675.90] This is why we labour and strive.
[676.26 → 682.30] Because we have put our hope in the living God who is the saviour of all people and especially of those who believe.
[683.06 → 684.76] Command and teach these things.
[685.06 → 687.98] Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young.
[688.48 → 693.88] But set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.
[694.16 → 699.34] Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of scripture, to preaching and teaching.
[699.52 → 705.70] Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through the prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.
[706.04 → 707.14] And then he finally says this.
[707.68 → 709.44] Be diligent in these matters.
[710.02 → 714.54] Jonathan, give yourself wholly to them so that everyone may see your progress.
[715.12 → 718.10] Watch your life and your doctrine closely.
[718.66 → 719.54] Persevere in them.
[719.84 → 720.08] Why?
[720.08 → 725.18] Because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.
[725.18 → 725.66] Thank you.
[725.66 → 726.02] Thank you.
[726.02 → 727.22] Thank you.
[744.16 → 748.04] Preaching, praying, serving, and shepherding.
[748.04 → 754.72] Those are just four dimensions of the beautiful and maybe overwhelming calling of pastor on ministry.
[755.30 → 758.78] And maybe it's worth saying, Jonathan, that the one who called you is faithful.
[759.68 → 764.16] And if it is Christ himself who calls you into ministry, he will equip you to do it in his way.
[765.44 → 769.86] At this time, I'm going to invite you to answer a few questions about your calling.
[770.14 → 772.52] After which time, you can say, I do God helping me.
[772.52 → 774.20] And then I'm going to ask our church a question.
[775.32 → 782.08] So first, do you believe that this call in this church is a call from God himself into ministry?
[783.18 → 788.42] Secondly, do you believe that the scripture is the word of God, the infallible rule of life and faith,
[788.66 → 791.54] and submit to the doctrinal standards of this church?
[792.88 → 795.82] Finally, do you promise to do the work of ministry faithfully,
[796.44 → 798.62] in a way worthy of the calling you've received,
[798.62 → 801.36] and in submission to the leadership of this church,
[801.66 → 805.32] so that we will be built up in the life of Christ,
[805.70 → 807.74] and shine that light brightly in our city?
[808.26 → 809.52] Jonathan, what is your answer?
[811.52 → 811.78] Amen.
[813.70 → 815.38] Hope, would you stand at this time?
[815.58 → 817.66] Because I have a question about your support for Jonathan,
[818.14 → 820.66] his marriage, and his family in this church.
[821.96 → 824.86] Do you receive Jonathan as a pastor in this community?
[824.86 → 827.84] Do you promise to encourage him, and them,
[828.16 → 829.40] in the work of ministry,
[830.00 → 830.86] to pray for them,
[831.34 → 832.94] to heed the word that is preached,
[833.38 → 835.94] that the kingdom of God may be advanced in our church,
[836.28 → 837.06] and in our city?
[837.18 → 838.86] Hope community, what is your answer?
[839.64 → 840.16] We do.
[840.62 → 841.50] God help us.
[841.82 → 842.06] Amen.
[842.22 → 842.78] You may be seated.
[846.76 → 849.14] It was already referenced by Pastor Ed,
[849.18 → 851.82] but I want to just highlight that Jonathan's dad is here,
[851.94 → 853.72] and Jonathan's dad is also a pastor,
[853.72 → 855.52] and we couldn't do an ordination service
[855.52 → 857.38] without hearing from Jonathan's dad.
[857.48 → 859.18] So Samuel Huang, would you please come up
[859.18 → 861.02] and share a few words to your own son?
[869.70 → 870.72] Good morning, everyone.
[872.14 → 874.34] My name is Samuel Huang,
[874.52 → 875.66] and son Huang,
[876.48 → 877.40] Jonathan's father.
[877.40 → 883.98] I will speak some few words in my own language,
[884.40 → 884.98] in Korean.
[886.30 → 890.08] The interpretation should be on the screen.
[890.08 → 918.58] thank you all because of the
[918.58 → 948.56] Thank you very much.
[948.58 → 955.12] 동료 목회자로서 짧게 당부의 말을 전하려고 합니다.
[957.98 → 966.32] 당신은 머지않아서 원치 않던 몇 가지의 어려움, 위기를 만나게 될 겁니다.
[966.32 → 978.62] 매너리즘이라고 하는 개인적인 위기, 또 관계성에서 오는 사람들로 인한 위기 같은 것들이죠.
[978.62 → 994.30] 반복되는 일상의 교회 일들, 그리고 사람들과의 관계에서 일어날 수밖에 없는 고민과 갈등과 그리고 배신감 같은 것들입니다.
[994.30 → 1003.26] 목사 안수를 받고 얼마간은 지금의 이 감격을 유지할 수 있을 겁니다.
[1003.68 → 1006.00] 그러나 그리 오래가지는 않을 겁니다.
[1006.00 → 1017.82] 그런 상태에서 이런 위기들을 맞게 되면 곧 그 위기를 이겨내기가 어렵게 될 겁니다.
[1018.58 → 1027.70] 감정적으로 무너지기도 하고 심하면 목사가 된 것을 후회하기도 하게 될 겁니다.
[1027.70 → 1036.20] 그런데 좋은 목사는 그런 과정을 거쳐서 만들어지는 겁니다.
[1037.30 → 1044.26] 철저하게 무너진 자신을 봐야 십자가 앞에 나오게 되는 거란 말이죠.
[1046.06 → 1047.60] 어떤 목사가 좋은 목사입니까?
[1047.60 → 1056.08] 자기의 못남을 알고 예수 그리스도의 십자가만을 붙드는 그런 목사 아니겠습니까?
[1058.48 → 1062.88] 저는 당신이 그런 좋은 목사가 되었으면 좋겠습니다.
[1064.40 → 1067.58] 에베소서 2장 1절에 사도바울의 표현처럼
[1067.58 → 1073.94] 죄로 인해서 죽고 또 죽는 비참한 자신을 보면서
[1073.94 → 1080.58] 하나님의 은혜에 기대어 사는 그런 좋은 목사가 되기를 바랍니다.
[1080.58 → 1081.98] 감사합니다.
[1097.58 → 1103.80] Well, this time we're going to pray for Jonathan and Moon and their family.
[1104.36 → 1107.20] And so I invite the leadership of our church, those of you who are here,
[1107.58 → 1110.14] and the staff of our church and any of you who are family and friends,
[1110.22 → 1113.16] we'll just pile on the stage, lay our hands on this couple,
[1113.34 → 1118.62] and pray for the Lord's grace and power and love to fill this couple to serve in this church.
[1118.62 → 1142.88] I've got a roaming mic.
[1143.28 → 1144.26] Andre's got one over there.
[1144.36 → 1145.28] Andre will start the prayer.
[1145.44 → 1146.28] I'll finish the prayer.
[1146.28 → 1148.84] Anyone who would like to join the prayer may do so.
[1149.36 → 1151.14] So let's pray for them.
[1152.30 → 1156.36] Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for this time that we get to recognize
[1156.36 → 1163.82] that you are the centre, and you have all of us in your hands.
[1164.20 → 1170.90] And we know that you brought Jonathan to this place through his path.
[1171.42 → 1172.66] You have been tugging on his heart.
[1172.66 → 1178.10] And we're so glad that here at Hope that we can be a part of this journey,
[1178.68 → 1180.82] this journey that is just beginning.
[1181.34 → 1186.02] And we pray that Jonathan and Moon stay strong with you.
[1186.98 → 1188.62] May they feel your presence.
[1189.36 → 1195.02] May their daily tasks, routines centre around you.
[1195.02 → 1207.04] May these four gifts be a reminder to put you as the centre and that they may lay everything before you.
[1207.04 → 1207.16] Amen.
[1213.70 → 1218.36] God, I thank you so much for Moon and Jonathan and their boys and how they've arrived at our church.
[1218.36 → 1222.16] You know all the days of their lives.
[1222.88 → 1231.82] And I just pray that with every step they take, they walk in you to love each other, to serve you,
[1232.06 → 1235.62] and to care for all the communities that they will be a part of.
[1236.16 → 1238.72] God, we're so grateful that they get to start here.
[1238.72 → 1242.72] Thank you, God, for the blessing that they've been.
[1243.00 → 1251.54] And I just pray you watch over them, their family, that you strengthen them as they carry on with this very important and challenging task.
[1251.86 → 1253.14] And it's not just a task.
[1253.18 → 1254.62] It's a role, and it's a calling.
[1254.72 → 1256.10] And we're so grateful for them.
[1256.10 → 1266.24] Dear Lord, yes, we're so thankful for Jonathan and Moon, Lord, and their service in our church, Lord.
[1266.94 → 1272.72] Lord, we just pray that you implant your holy word deep in the depths of their souls, Lord.
[1273.34 → 1282.92] May Jonathan grow to just be like a strong oak tree by living waters that just can give life to our community and to future communities, Lord.
[1282.92 → 1287.66] And we pray that you be with Moon as she walks beside him, Lord.
[1287.80 → 1291.12] Would your Holy Spirit just cover them both in your name?
[1300.08 → 1305.40] Dear Jesus, we thank you for Jonathan and Moon, Lord.
[1305.50 → 1309.06] And we pray that you would continually bless them in their journey.
[1309.06 → 1319.30] And, Lord, in those moments of discouragement and difficulties, Lord, we pray that they would feel your arm around them
[1319.30 → 1329.78] and that you would place people in their surrounding that would always keep them encouraged in continuing their ministry in you.
[1329.98 → 1332.62] We ask for your continued blessing always.
[1332.62 → 1348.90] Lord, words such as leader, mentor, pillar, gift, blessing are the words that describe Jonathan.
[1348.90 → 1356.62] I have been witness to the amazing relationships that he has had the ability of creating and nurturing.
[1357.86 → 1371.26] Relationships that give encouragement to such the lives of young adults that may have felt lost in the grips of life and stresses, Lord.
[1371.26 → 1378.30] I ask that you, Lord, I ask that you continuously bless this beautiful family, bless their marriage.
[1378.76 → 1390.62] I bind Satan from this family, from the relationships that Jonathan is going to continue to nurture, nourish, and build.
[1391.18 → 1397.58] The lives that he has yet to touch and the relationships that he has yet to connect with.
[1397.58 → 1403.96] And I just ask that you put a covering over Jonathan and Moon and the boys.
[1404.22 → 1413.10] And I just want to thank you for this gift that you've given this church that's just so beautiful that words just can't express,
[1413.24 → 1417.66] that we just continuously want to lift them up in our prayers.
[1422.18 → 1424.96] Father, I thank you for the gift of being your church.
[1424.96 → 1431.56] Thank you for caring for our church in such a way that you raise up leaders, elders and deacons and pastors.
[1432.60 → 1437.00] And we pray that you would bless Jonathan and Moon as a couple, as a family.
[1437.84 → 1441.10] I pray that they would flourish in this season ahead of ministry.
[1441.70 → 1446.04] And that you would deepen them in the life and the power and the love of Jesus Christ.
[1446.42 → 1452.90] That would fill them, that you would fill our church, and you would fill our city with the good news of Christ.
[1452.90 → 1454.82] We pray this in his name.
[1455.62 → 1455.92] Amen.
[1459.92 → 1463.04] Let's welcome Jonathan as a pastor into our church.
[1463.04 → 1482.22] Our Cornerstone children are finally now invited to Cornerstone upstairs.
[1482.50 → 1483.94] If you're new, you can bring them up there.
[1484.46 → 1489.26] And we are going to sing a song of blessing over Jonathan's ministry called Your Labour Is Not In Vain.
[1489.26 → 1491.64] And I do invite you to stand as we sing this song together.
[1491.64 → 1498.44] First chorus all the way through.
[1498.44 → 1499.80] For the intro.
[1513.38 → 1519.42] Your labour is not in vain.
[1519.42 → 1528.48] Though the ground underneath you is cursed and start and stained.
[1529.02 → 1534.86] You're planting and weeping are never the same.
[1535.62 → 1540.26] Your labour is not in vain.
[1541.86 → 1546.60] Your labour is not unknown.
[1546.60 → 1554.92] Though the rocks they cry out and the seed may grow.
[1555.66 → 1561.56] The place of your toil may not seem like a home.
[1561.56 → 1566.42] But your labour is not unknown.
[1568.04 → 1570.94] For I am with you.
[1570.94 → 1574.26] I am with you.
[1574.26 → 1577.60] I am with you.
[1577.60 → 1580.92] I am with you.
[1580.92 → 1583.74] For I have called you.
[1583.74 → 1586.38] Called you by name.
[1586.38 → 1616.38] 
[1616.38 → 1619.70] Your labour is not in vain.
[1619.70 → 1622.64] For I have called you.
[1622.64 → 1625.70] I am with you.
[1625.70 → 1626.70] I am with you.
[1626.70 → 1629.02] I am with you.
[1629.02 → 1631.02] I am with you.
[1631.02 → 1633.02] I am with you.
[1633.02 → 1635.76] For I have called you.
[1635.76 → 1638.22] Called you by name.
[1638.22 → 1645.54] Your labour is not in vain.
[1645.54 → 1646.54] The houses you labour.
[1646.54 → 1650.86] The houses you labour to build.
[1650.86 → 1659.36] Will finally with laughter and joy be filled.
[1659.36 → 1666.36] The serpent that hurts and all that is broken.
[1666.36 → 1671.68] And all that is broken be healed.
[1671.68 → 1672.68] For I have called you.
[1672.68 → 1674.68] For I have called you.
[1674.68 → 1677.68] I am with you.
[1677.68 → 1680.68] I am with you.
[1680.68 → 1684.68] I am with you.
[1684.68 → 1686.68] For I have called you.
[1686.68 → 1689.68] Called you by name.
[1689.68 → 1694.06] Your labour is not in vain.
[1694.06 → 1698.36] Your labour is not in vain.
[1698.36 → 1712.26] For I have called you.
[1712.26 → 1714.84] For I have called you.
[1714.84 → 1722.12] Your labour is not in vain
[1722.12 → 1728.96] Your labour is not in vain
[1728.96 → 1736.88] Though the ground underneath you is cursed and stained
[1736.88 → 1743.32] You're planting and reaping are never the same
[1743.32 → 1749.88] Your labour is not in vain
[1773.32 → 1775.54] Good morning
[1775.54 → 1779.88] My name is Bradley, and it's my joy
[1779.88 → 1783.24] My honour and my privilege to lead us in the community prayer today
[1783.24 → 1785.56] It's a very special Sunday as we can see
[1785.56 → 1787.76] Today is Jonathan's ordination day
[1787.76 → 1789.78] And it is a community prayer
[1789.78 → 1791.72] But I just want to personally say Jonathan
[1791.72 → 1792.68] I'm really proud of you
[1792.68 → 1794.54] I'm honoured to call you my friend
[1794.54 → 1796.32] And yeah I love you
[1796.32 → 1797.62] It's good to see that
[1797.62 → 1800.24] As always
[1800.24 → 1802.66] If you have any prayer needs
[1802.66 → 1804.38] Need somebody to talk to
[1804.38 → 1806.00] Whether it's good or it's bad
[1806.00 → 1806.72] Whatever it is
[1806.72 → 1809.10] I'll be standing over there
[1809.10 → 1810.10] By the pumpkins
[1810.10 → 1812.40] And we can have a little pumpkin prayer
[1812.40 → 1813.02] I don't know
[1813.02 → 1815.94] But I'm there for you if you need it
[1815.94 → 1817.82] Without further ado
[1817.82 → 1819.26] Let us come to the Lord in prayer
[1819.26 → 1821.96] Lord
[1821.96 → 1825.32] We thank you for gathering here in your house once again
[1825.32 → 1827.90] As we gather here today
[1827.90 → 1830.46] We always come with a mixture of emotions
[1830.46 → 1833.06] We have a feeling of joy
[1833.06 → 1835.38] For what we'll be witnessing today with Jonathan
[1835.38 → 1837.68] And also a sense of lament
[1837.68 → 1839.90] For what is happening around the world today
[1839.90 → 1840.88] As we see in Gaza
[1840.88 → 1842.90] In Ukraine and elsewhere
[1842.90 → 1846.40] But regardless of what's on our hearts
[1846.40 → 1847.40] And our minds today
[1847.40 → 1849.40] We bring it all to you
[1849.40 → 1852.14] You have told us that you know what we need
[1852.14 → 1853.24] Before we even ask
[1853.24 → 1855.44] So Lord hear our prayers now
[1855.44 → 1858.42] We pray for the families
[1858.42 → 1859.96] And the households among us
[1859.96 → 1862.24] We pray for those who are grieving
[1862.24 → 1863.96] Those who are sick
[1863.96 → 1865.94] For those who are dealing with loss
[1865.94 → 1868.54] To know that you are with us
[1868.54 → 1869.86] Grieving alongside of us
[1869.86 → 1871.30] During life's difficult journeys
[1871.30 → 1872.24] Is always a comfort
[1872.24 → 1875.66] We continually pray for our children
[1875.66 → 1877.70] For their schools
[1877.70 → 1878.78] Their teachers
[1878.78 → 1879.80] And their classmates
[1879.80 → 1882.32] During these formative years
[1882.32 → 1883.08] That are so important
[1883.08 → 1884.34] We continually pray for them
[1884.34 → 1886.72] That not only they'll be formed through you
[1886.72 → 1888.96] But they can help shape others as well
[1888.96 → 1890.36] Through their displayed love of you
[1890.36 → 1893.74] And Lord we lift our city
[1893.74 → 1895.58] And our neighbourhoods to you in prayer
[1895.58 → 1898.12] As the area is growing
[1898.12 → 1899.84] Developing and transforming
[1899.84 → 1901.26] Over the next decade
[1901.26 → 1903.66] We pray that the local churches
[1903.66 → 1904.68] Are a strong presence
[1904.68 → 1907.10] May these new opportunities
[1907.10 → 1908.44] To witness as a church
[1908.44 → 1909.44] Not be squandered
[1909.44 → 1911.90] And may they be capitalized on
[1911.90 → 1912.66] So we can reach out
[1912.66 → 1913.56] To more and more people
[1913.56 → 1915.18] That perhaps does not know you at all
[1915.18 → 1918.60] We continually pray
[1918.60 → 1919.76] For the unrest in the world
[1919.76 → 1922.02] As we turn on our TVs
[1922.02 → 1923.34] Our social media
[1923.34 → 1924.38] We're constantly reminded
[1924.38 → 1925.82] Of the brokenness in this world
[1925.82 → 1928.34] Lately we're seeing devastation
[1928.34 → 1929.60] We're seeing division
[1929.60 → 1930.76] Confusion
[1930.76 → 1932.50] As to what's going on
[1932.50 → 1933.38] And why it's happening
[1933.38 → 1935.18] It can be overwhelming
[1935.18 → 1937.16] And it creates a heavy heart
[1937.16 → 1938.16] And it makes us just long
[1938.16 → 1938.94] For you to return
[1938.94 → 1942.18] We're constantly feeling pressures
[1942.18 → 1943.68] Pressures to choose sides
[1943.68 → 1945.40] We feel the pressure
[1945.40 → 1947.04] To justify and deem
[1947.04 → 1948.42] What is good, and what is bad
[1948.42 → 1950.10] We feel obligated
[1950.10 → 1951.86] To choose political viewpoints
[1951.86 → 1953.28] We may feel worried
[1953.28 → 1955.00] And afraid to speak up on occasion
[1955.00 → 1956.68] And worried about the health
[1956.68 → 1957.50] Of our relationships
[1957.50 → 1958.38] And our friendships
[1958.38 → 1959.48] And our families
[1959.48 → 1960.46] Over tense issues
[1960.46 → 1962.30] Lord remind us
[1962.30 → 1964.26] The one choice that does matter
[1964.26 → 1964.64] In the end
[1964.64 → 1966.28] Is not what nation we belong to
[1966.28 → 1967.46] Or what party we support
[1967.46 → 1969.30] Or anything along those lines
[1969.30 → 1970.42] But what ultimately matters
[1970.42 → 1971.50] Is what we choose to do
[1971.50 → 1972.62] With your son Jesus Christ
[1972.62 → 1974.06] And how we represent him to others
[1974.06 → 1976.62] So Lord
[1976.62 → 1978.18] We ask you to empower us
[1978.18 → 1979.42] Golden us
[1979.42 → 1980.76] Strengthen us
[1980.76 → 1981.64] To speak and act
[1981.64 → 1982.84] As ambassadors for Christ
[1982.84 → 1984.72] Speak into our hearts
[1984.72 → 1985.36] Directly
[1985.36 → 1986.48] And remind us
[1986.48 → 1987.48] That you created us all
[1987.48 → 1988.08] With a purpose
[1988.08 → 1989.84] You named every hair
[1989.84 → 1990.36] On our heads
[1990.36 → 1991.90] You knit us together
[1991.90 → 1992.88] In our mothers wombs
[1992.88 → 1993.88] And you've given us
[1993.88 → 1995.10] All a charge to serve
[1995.10 → 1996.52] You've given us
[1996.52 → 1997.20] All a commission
[1997.20 → 1998.16] To go make disciples
[1998.16 → 1999.06] In all the nations
[1999.06 → 2001.76] So we thank you
[2001.76 → 2002.96] For the many servants
[2002.96 → 2003.88] That you have called
[2003.88 → 2004.90] That have risen up
[2004.90 → 2005.80] To serve in your kingdom
[2005.80 → 2006.96] Both locally and globally
[2006.96 → 2009.02] You have called your child
[2009.02 → 2010.06] Our brother Jonathan
[2010.06 → 2010.78] To the pulpit
[2010.78 → 2012.52] To a life of ministry
[2012.52 → 2014.62] And we celebrate that today
[2014.62 → 2016.96] We lift an outpouring
[2016.96 → 2017.70] Of thankfulness
[2017.70 → 2018.56] For this gift of him
[2018.56 → 2020.54] May Jonathan's time
[2020.54 → 2021.52] In ministry be fruitful
[2021.52 → 2023.20] Guided by your wisdom
[2023.20 → 2024.58] And the gifts
[2024.58 → 2025.72] That you have instilled in him
[2025.72 → 2027.68] May he be filled
[2027.68 → 2029.02] With support from you
[2029.02 → 2029.92] Through the spirit
[2029.92 → 2031.58] And from all of us
[2031.58 → 2032.56] Surrounding him here today
[2032.56 → 2033.94] May his gifts
[2033.94 → 2034.50] And his talents
[2034.50 → 2035.76] Continue to be utilized
[2035.76 → 2037.74] And continue to be developed
[2037.74 → 2038.62] So that he can help
[2038.62 → 2039.44] Lead us
[2039.44 → 2040.62] To being a witnessing
[2040.62 → 2041.62] Community of believers
[2041.62 → 2042.82] And leading us
[2042.82 → 2043.74] All closer to you
[2043.74 → 2046.22] We continually pray
[2046.22 → 2047.32] For all the church leaders
[2047.32 → 2048.46] We pray for pastors
[2048.46 → 2049.20] Priests
[2049.20 → 2050.44] Chaplains in our neighbourhood
[2050.44 → 2052.02] For anyone who has
[2052.02 → 2052.90] Accepted that call
[2052.90 → 2054.30] And leads your people
[2054.30 → 2055.26] We pray for strength
[2055.26 → 2056.70] Discernment and wisdom
[2056.70 → 2058.62] We trust in you
[2058.62 → 2059.60] That you have entrusted
[2059.60 → 2060.18] These servants
[2060.18 → 2061.10] To lead your people
[2061.10 → 2062.44] And we pray that
[2062.44 → 2063.26] They take their calling
[2063.26 → 2063.72] Seriously
[2063.72 → 2065.44] And we pray that
[2065.44 → 2066.52] People getting to know you
[2066.52 → 2067.18] And follow you
[2067.18 → 2068.12] Is their main mission
[2068.12 → 2070.00] Now Lord
[2070.00 → 2070.98] We pray for your servant
[2070.98 → 2071.66] Pastor Dave
[2071.66 → 2073.00] As he comes up
[2073.00 → 2073.52] To lead us
[2073.52 → 2074.18] Through your word
[2074.18 → 2075.92] And this special celebration
[2075.92 → 2077.16] May his words
[2077.16 → 2077.66] Be truthful
[2077.66 → 2078.38] And impactful
[2078.38 → 2079.68] And resonate
[2079.68 → 2080.66] With all of us
[2080.66 → 2081.10] In our hearts
[2081.10 → 2081.54] And our minds
[2081.54 → 2083.06] In Jesus name
[2083.06 → 2083.92] Amen
[2098.12 → 2100.64] One of my children
[2100.64 → 2101.68] Just leaned over to me
[2101.68 → 2102.22] And they said
[2102.22 → 2103.18] Are you still preaching?
[2103.40 → 2104.82] It's so late in the service
[2104.82 → 2108.56] So I'm going to do my best
[2108.56 → 2110.54] To condense some of what
[2110.54 → 2111.66] I was going to say
[2111.66 → 2113.86] I thought it would be fitting
[2113.86 → 2114.94] To preach on the vocation
[2114.94 → 2115.84] Of the pastorate
[2115.84 → 2117.34] And part of it is that
[2117.34 → 2118.62] One of the weird things
[2118.62 → 2119.48] About being a pastor
[2119.48 → 2120.64] Is people will ask you
[2120.64 → 2122.20] What do you do anyway?
[2122.44 → 2123.44] Other than on Sundays
[2123.44 → 2125.66] And I think it would be helpful
[2125.66 → 2126.84] To share a few words
[2126.84 → 2128.34] In addition to what's been shared
[2128.34 → 2129.74] About being a pastor
[2129.74 → 2130.74] So if you have your Bible
[2130.74 → 2133.04] Turn with me to Acts chapter 20
[2133.04 → 2134.90] And we're going to read
[2134.90 → 2136.56] Some farewell words
[2136.56 → 2137.66] From Paul
[2137.66 → 2138.88] About ministry
[2138.88 → 2140.84] Starting in verse 25
[2140.84 → 2144.86] Now I know that none of you
[2144.86 → 2146.26] Among whom I have gone about
[2146.26 → 2147.16] Preaching the kingdom
[2147.16 → 2148.80] Will ever see me again
[2148.80 → 2150.66] Therefore I declare
[2150.66 → 2152.10] To you that I am innocent
[2152.10 → 2153.32] Of the blood of everyone
[2153.32 → 2155.34] For I have not hesitated
[2155.34 → 2156.68] To proclaim to you
[2156.68 → 2158.54] The whole will of God
[2158.54 → 2161.04] Keep watch over yourselves
[2161.04 → 2162.60] And all the flock
[2162.60 → 2163.82] Of which the Holy Spirit
[2163.82 → 2165.24] Has made you overseers
[2165.24 → 2168.04] Be shepherds of the church of God
[2168.04 → 2169.46] Which he bought
[2169.46 → 2171.56] With his own blood
[2171.56 → 2176.84] Well just over a week ago
[2176.84 → 2177.76] Pastor Jonathan
[2177.76 → 2180.30] Just sustained his public examination
[2180.30 → 2181.28] To be a pastor
[2181.28 → 2182.92] It's sort of everyone's worst nightmare
[2182.92 → 2183.96] He has to stand up
[2183.96 → 2185.10] For an hour and a half
[2185.10 → 2186.52] And be publicly examined
[2186.52 → 2187.88] By pastors and church leaders
[2187.88 → 2188.58] On his faith
[2188.58 → 2189.40] His doctrine
[2189.40 → 2190.58] His knowledge of the Bible
[2190.58 → 2192.02] Church history
[2192.02 → 2192.78] All the rest
[2192.78 → 2193.92] And we celebrate
[2193.92 → 2195.06] Jonathan that you passed
[2195.06 → 2197.14] One of the unique challenges
[2197.14 → 2197.94] Jonathan faced
[2197.94 → 2199.62] Was that his ordination exam
[2199.62 → 2200.38] Was pushed back
[2200.38 → 2201.42] By an hour and a half
[2201.42 → 2202.88] Because there was another matter
[2202.88 → 2204.20] That we needed to attend to
[2204.20 → 2206.06] There was another pastor
[2206.06 → 2206.82] In our area
[2206.82 → 2208.26] Who was finishing ministry
[2208.26 → 2209.50] And he wanted to take a moment
[2209.50 → 2210.96] To address all the leaders
[2210.96 → 2212.18] Of the churches in our area
[2212.18 → 2212.92] And so he did
[2212.92 → 2215.26] He started by saying
[2215.26 → 2216.20] That he planted a church
[2216.20 → 2217.18] 16 years ago
[2217.18 → 2218.76] And he loved that church
[2218.76 → 2219.80] He loved ministering
[2219.80 → 2220.44] In that church
[2220.44 → 2223.02] He enjoyed the seasons of joy
[2223.02 → 2224.04] He had a hardship
[2224.04 → 2225.14] That they faced
[2225.14 → 2226.54] He talked about COVID
[2226.54 → 2227.90] And how hard that was
[2227.90 → 2229.34] For a church planter like him
[2229.34 → 2230.18] And some of the challenges
[2230.18 → 2230.80] He faced
[2230.80 → 2232.36] And then he said
[2232.36 → 2233.24] That in discernment
[2233.24 → 2233.88] After COVID
[2233.88 → 2234.70] It became clear to him
[2234.70 → 2235.16] That he was going to
[2235.16 → 2235.96] Finish pastoring
[2235.96 → 2237.04] His time as a pastor
[2237.04 → 2237.90] Had come to a close
[2237.90 → 2238.70] And he was going to do
[2238.70 → 2239.66] Something else entirely
[2239.66 → 2242.38] His conclusion included
[2242.38 → 2243.00] These words
[2243.00 → 2243.90] And I'll read them to you
[2243.90 → 2244.42] He said
[2244.42 → 2245.70] You might think
[2245.70 → 2246.72] That because I'm finishing
[2246.72 → 2247.50] As a pastor
[2247.50 → 2249.06] That I'm frustrated
[2249.06 → 2249.86] With the church
[2249.86 → 2251.80] I'm not frustrated
[2251.80 → 2252.62] With the church
[2252.62 → 2253.98] I'm not down
[2253.98 → 2254.76] On the church
[2254.76 → 2256.28] I love the church
[2256.28 → 2257.72] In fact
[2257.72 → 2258.62] I have no regrets
[2258.62 → 2260.14] About going into ministry
[2260.14 → 2261.84] Then he paused
[2261.84 → 2262.40] And with tears
[2262.40 → 2263.00] In his eyes
[2263.00 → 2263.52] He said
[2263.52 → 2264.28] As a close
[2264.28 → 2265.54] It's a privilege
[2265.54 → 2267.18] To be a pastor
[2267.18 → 2269.66] And with those words
[2269.66 → 2270.70] We prayed for the pastor
[2270.70 → 2271.56] And then we went right
[2271.56 → 2273.22] Into Jonathan's examination
[2273.22 → 2274.32] Into ministry
[2274.32 → 2275.78] And I thought
[2275.78 → 2276.70] It was a fitting segue
[2276.70 → 2278.48] And those words
[2278.48 → 2279.08] From that pastor
[2279.08 → 2279.88] Kept circling around
[2279.88 → 2280.48] In my mind
[2280.48 → 2281.24] Because I saw
[2281.24 → 2281.80] A connection
[2281.80 → 2282.82] Between these words
[2282.82 → 2283.56] In Acts 20
[2283.56 → 2284.86] And the words
[2284.86 → 2285.62] Of that pastor
[2285.62 → 2286.52] You see
[2286.52 → 2287.88] The words in this passage
[2287.88 → 2289.06] Have a relationship
[2289.06 → 2289.82] They are also
[2289.82 → 2290.92] From a church planter
[2290.92 → 2292.98] Who is finishing
[2292.98 → 2293.88] In ministry
[2293.88 → 2295.76] And has some final words
[2295.76 → 2296.60] To say to leaders
[2296.60 → 2298.06] About pastoring
[2298.06 → 2299.98] You should know
[2299.98 → 2300.68] That when Paul
[2300.68 → 2301.56] Says these words
[2301.56 → 2302.44] In Acts chapter 20
[2302.44 → 2303.06] They're not just
[2303.06 → 2304.40] Theological reflections
[2304.40 → 2305.08] On ministry
[2305.08 → 2305.78] They are words
[2305.78 → 2306.36] That are born
[2306.36 → 2307.70] With deep emotion
[2307.70 → 2308.22] In fact
[2308.22 → 2309.70] In a few verses later
[2309.70 → 2310.62] Paul and the other
[2310.62 → 2311.42] Leaders of the church
[2311.42 → 2312.70] Are weeping together
[2312.70 → 2314.14] Paul had helped
[2314.14 → 2314.84] Plant the church
[2314.84 → 2315.32] In Ephesus
[2315.32 → 2316.96] He worked in ministry
[2316.96 → 2317.62] With these leaders
[2317.62 → 2318.84] He loved the church
[2318.84 → 2319.60] He worked hard
[2319.60 → 2320.18] With the church
[2320.18 → 2321.48] And now his ministry
[2321.48 → 2322.70] Had received resistance
[2322.70 → 2323.72] Not everyone liked
[2323.72 → 2324.58] The message of the kingdom
[2324.58 → 2325.24] About Jesus
[2325.24 → 2326.36] And he knew
[2326.36 → 2327.00] That it's likely
[2327.00 → 2327.84] He would never see
[2327.84 → 2328.68] The leaders again
[2328.68 → 2330.26] He probably had a sense
[2330.26 → 2331.18] He was going to get arrested
[2331.18 → 2332.16] And go on trial
[2332.16 → 2334.42] And so here is his final words
[2334.42 → 2335.06] To the leaders
[2335.06 → 2335.92] As he leaves
[2335.92 → 2337.14] And they take over leadership
[2337.14 → 2338.56] About ministry
[2338.56 → 2341.22] And we're going to reflect briefly
[2341.22 → 2343.30] On what Paul's parting words
[2343.30 → 2344.22] To the leaders of the church
[2344.22 → 2344.76] In Ephesus
[2344.76 → 2346.30] Have to say to someone
[2346.30 → 2347.24] Like Jonathan Huang
[2347.24 → 2348.88] As he steps into ministry
[2348.88 → 2350.10] Here in Surrey
[2350.10 → 2350.80] British Columbia
[2350.80 → 2353.30] The first thing
[2353.30 → 2354.24] That Paul names
[2354.24 → 2355.58] About his own ministry
[2355.58 → 2356.82] Is preaching
[2356.82 → 2358.22] In fact
[2358.22 → 2359.14] It should be noted
[2359.14 → 2360.04] That what got Paul
[2360.04 → 2361.26] In so much trouble
[2361.26 → 2362.70] Was preaching
[2362.70 → 2365.12] Preaching is what people resisted
[2365.12 → 2366.28] His message about Jesus
[2366.28 → 2367.44] Is what got him in trouble
[2367.44 → 2368.50] And ultimately put him
[2368.50 → 2369.10] On trial
[2369.10 → 2370.12] And in prison
[2370.12 → 2372.02] And in verse 25
[2372.02 → 2372.90] And in verse 27
[2372.90 → 2373.20] He says
[2373.20 → 2373.96] Two important things
[2373.96 → 2374.54] About preaching
[2374.54 → 2375.46] Verse 27
[2375.46 → 2376.00] We read
[2376.00 → 2377.96] For I have not hesitated
[2377.96 → 2379.62] To proclaim to you
[2379.62 → 2381.30] The whole will of God
[2381.30 → 2382.52] It's a bold statement
[2382.52 → 2383.10] Don't you think
[2383.10 → 2384.46] And in verse 25
[2384.46 → 2384.84] He says
[2384.84 → 2385.42] You know that
[2385.42 → 2386.22] When I was with you
[2386.22 → 2387.46] I preached
[2387.46 → 2388.62] The kingdom
[2388.62 → 2390.60] And those two phrases
[2390.60 → 2391.36] Are very related
[2391.36 → 2392.78] To preach the whole will of God
[2392.78 → 2393.64] And to preach the kingdom
[2393.64 → 2394.76] Are in some sense
[2394.76 → 2395.48] The same thing
[2395.48 → 2396.98] And Jonathan
[2396.98 → 2397.64] You know that
[2397.64 → 2398.30] In our tradition
[2398.30 → 2399.62] We talk a lot about preaching
[2399.62 → 2400.54] It means a lot
[2400.54 → 2401.58] It's an important task
[2401.58 → 2402.08] To preach
[2402.08 → 2403.38] And we talk a lot
[2403.38 → 2403.94] About preaching
[2403.94 → 2404.94] The kingdom
[2404.94 → 2406.70] And for us
[2406.70 → 2407.68] When we say the kingdom
[2407.68 → 2408.68] And to preach the kingdom
[2408.68 → 2409.24] We mean
[2409.24 → 2410.80] That the kingdom of God
[2410.80 → 2411.62] Is His rule
[2411.62 → 2412.70] Over the whole creation
[2412.70 → 2414.26] That the story
[2414.26 → 2414.80] Of the Bible
[2414.80 → 2416.02] Really is the story
[2416.02 → 2416.98] Of God's kingdom
[2416.98 → 2417.98] It starts with God
[2417.98 → 2419.24] Establishing His world
[2419.24 → 2420.42] As good and beautiful
[2420.42 → 2421.76] Places humanity
[2421.76 → 2422.66] To enjoy it
[2422.66 → 2423.44] And then humans
[2423.44 → 2424.54] Rebel against God
[2424.54 → 2426.00] And from that point on
[2426.00 → 2426.68] From Israel
[2426.68 → 2427.42] On to Jesus
[2427.42 → 2428.44] Through to the church
[2428.44 → 2430.06] God's plan
[2430.06 → 2430.98] Is to restore
[2430.98 → 2431.56] His kingdom
[2431.56 → 2433.06] God's plan
[2433.06 → 2433.94] Is to restore
[2433.94 → 2435.06] What has been lost
[2435.06 → 2436.40] And His work in Jesus
[2436.40 → 2437.44] Is to redeem
[2437.44 → 2438.72] And reclaim
[2438.72 → 2440.30] His earth
[2440.30 → 2441.66] His kingdom
[2441.66 → 2443.38] And as one of my
[2443.38 → 2443.94] Favourite writers
[2443.94 → 2444.50] Puts it
[2444.50 → 2445.72] God will not let
[2445.72 → 2446.22] Sin
[2446.22 → 2447.50] Or Satan
[2447.50 → 2448.84] Or death
[2448.84 → 2449.92] Take one
[2449.92 → 2450.78] Shred
[2450.78 → 2452.08] Of His good creation
[2452.08 → 2453.10] He will rescue it
[2453.10 → 2454.28] And He will redeem it
[2454.28 → 2454.96] Through the finished work
[2454.96 → 2455.80] Of Jesus Christ
[2455.80 → 2456.90] On the cross
[2456.90 → 2459.24] So Jonathan
[2459.24 → 2460.92] Preach the kingdom
[2460.92 → 2462.96] Preach the whole
[2462.96 → 2463.70] Will of God
[2463.70 → 2465.22] Preach that He loves
[2465.22 → 2466.28] This world so much
[2466.28 → 2467.20] He loves humanity
[2467.20 → 2467.70] So much
[2467.70 → 2468.34] That He will give
[2468.34 → 2469.44] His only Son
[2469.44 → 2470.68] So that we will
[2470.68 → 2471.84] Enjoy this creation
[2471.84 → 2472.74] Forever
[2472.74 → 2474.82] Preach the whole
[2474.82 → 2475.58] Will of God
[2475.58 → 2476.26] Not just the
[2476.26 → 2477.16] Popular passages
[2477.16 → 2478.36] Not just the
[2478.36 → 2479.40] Hobby horse passages
[2479.40 → 2480.40] That every pastor
[2480.40 → 2480.86] Has
[2480.86 → 2483.04] Preach the word
[2483.04 → 2485.42] I will remind you
[2485.42 → 2486.02] What one Regent
[2486.02 → 2486.64] Professor said
[2486.64 → 2487.24] To both of us
[2487.24 → 2487.84] When we studied
[2487.84 → 2488.48] At Regent
[2488.48 → 2489.32] He said
[2489.32 → 2489.84] It is not
[2489.84 → 2490.96] Your brilliant insights
[2490.96 → 2492.28] It is not
[2492.28 → 2493.56] Your creative takes
[2493.56 → 2494.46] On a passage
[2494.46 → 2495.48] Nor even
[2495.48 → 2496.34] Your eloquence
[2496.34 → 2497.36] That will change
[2497.36 → 2498.24] The hearts of people
[2498.24 → 2499.76] It is when people
[2499.76 → 2501.30] Hear the word of Christ
[2501.30 → 2502.62] Proclaimed through
[2502.62 → 2503.32] The scriptures
[2503.32 → 2505.52] That's how we change
[2505.52 → 2506.76] And so Jonathan
[2506.76 → 2508.90] Preached the word of Christ
[2508.90 → 2510.10] As revealed in the scriptures
[2510.10 → 2511.82] And trust that the same God
[2511.82 → 2512.60] Who changed hearts
[2512.60 → 2513.42] In the first century
[2513.42 → 2514.78] Will change hearts
[2514.78 → 2515.34] Today
[2515.34 → 2516.44] Here in our church
[2516.44 → 2519.80] There are two specific
[2519.80 → 2521.06] Instructions in this passage
[2521.06 → 2522.50] That Paul gives to leaders
[2522.50 → 2523.74] In Ephesus
[2523.74 → 2525.26] And the first is
[2525.26 → 2526.46] About their own hearts
[2526.46 → 2528.28] Paul says to the leaders
[2528.28 → 2528.54] Then
[2528.54 → 2529.42] And he says it to Jonathan
[2529.42 → 2529.82] Now
[2529.82 → 2530.94] Keep watch
[2530.94 → 2532.18] Over your own life
[2532.18 → 2534.70] There are some very real
[2534.70 → 2535.24] Temptations
[2535.24 → 2535.92] That come with being
[2535.92 → 2536.80] A leader in the church
[2536.80 → 2538.60] The temptation
[2538.60 → 2539.34] For power
[2539.34 → 2540.78] For influence
[2540.78 → 2542.28] To use money
[2542.28 → 2543.80] For your own gain
[2543.80 → 2545.26] Sexual temptation
[2545.26 → 2546.24] And many more
[2546.24 → 2547.26] Paul knew
[2547.26 → 2548.40] Personally I'm sure
[2548.40 → 2549.38] The temptations
[2549.38 → 2550.28] That come with leadership
[2550.28 → 2551.20] And he says to the leaders
[2551.20 → 2551.74] Of the church
[2551.74 → 2552.82] Watch
[2552.82 → 2553.94] Your own life
[2553.94 → 2555.84] Be aware
[2555.84 → 2556.72] Of the temptations
[2556.72 → 2557.32] That come
[2557.32 → 2559.36] And it's interesting
[2559.36 → 2559.76] How
[2559.76 → 2561.34] There's been a book
[2561.34 → 2561.86] Published
[2561.86 → 2562.84] On ministry
[2562.84 → 2563.16] It's called
[2563.16 → 2563.98] Dangerous Calling
[2563.98 → 2564.92] It's by Paul Tripp
[2564.92 → 2566.04] And on that book
[2566.04 → 2566.60] There's a number
[2566.60 → 2567.32] Of endorsements
[2567.32 → 2567.94] In the jacket
[2567.94 → 2568.82] And on the back cover
[2568.82 → 2569.92] By megachurch pastors
[2569.92 → 2571.08] And I was told
[2571.08 → 2571.72] That recently
[2571.72 → 2573.24] Four of those pastors
[2573.24 → 2574.36] Have exited ministry
[2574.36 → 2576.30] Due to moral failure
[2576.30 → 2577.28] Corruption
[2577.28 → 2578.48] And influence
[2578.48 → 2579.26] And all the rest
[2579.26 → 2581.08] And so we hear that word again
[2581.08 → 2581.68] Keep watch
[2581.68 → 2582.48] Over your life
[2582.48 → 2584.18] Do not open the Bible
[2584.18 → 2584.92] Just to preach
[2584.92 → 2586.14] But allow the word of Christ
[2586.14 → 2586.96] To dwell in you
[2586.96 → 2587.66] And your marriage
[2587.66 → 2588.28] And your family
[2588.28 → 2590.56] Pray that the life of Christ
[2590.56 → 2591.24] Would nurture you
[2591.24 → 2591.80] In such a way
[2591.80 → 2592.92] That the gift you give
[2592.92 → 2593.42] To hope
[2593.42 → 2594.52] Is your own
[2594.52 → 2595.70] Transforming self
[2595.70 → 2596.80] In the likeness
[2596.80 → 2597.22] Of Jesus
[2597.22 → 2600.56] The second
[2600.56 → 2601.32] Instruction
[2601.32 → 2602.02] That Paul gives
[2602.02 → 2602.64] To the church
[2602.64 → 2603.82] Is to watch
[2603.82 → 2604.40] Over the flock
[2604.40 → 2605.20] And I'll read for you
[2605.20 → 2606.10] From verse 28
[2606.10 → 2607.64] He writes
[2607.64 → 2608.50] Keep watch
[2608.50 → 2609.54] Over all the flock
[2609.54 → 2610.92] Of which the Holy Spirit
[2610.92 → 2612.42] Has made you an overseer
[2612.42 → 2613.74] Be shepherds
[2613.74 → 2614.36] Of the church
[2614.36 → 2615.02] Of God
[2615.02 → 2616.16] Which he bought
[2616.16 → 2617.64] With his own
[2617.64 → 2618.58] Blood
[2618.58 → 2620.38] Now there's no
[2620.38 → 2621.26] Shortage of things
[2621.26 → 2622.72] That can threaten
[2622.72 → 2623.40] The life
[2623.40 → 2623.96] And the health
[2623.96 → 2624.58] Of a church
[2624.58 → 2626.68] Leadership division
[2626.68 → 2628.22] Toxic leadership
[2628.22 → 2629.04] Conflict
[2629.04 → 2629.82] In the church
[2629.82 → 2631.08] Power grabs
[2631.08 → 2631.92] Within the church
[2631.92 → 2633.58] A lack of discipleship
[2633.58 → 2635.32] A lack of evangelism
[2635.32 → 2635.82] In the city
[2635.82 → 2637.50] A slow drift
[2637.50 → 2639.36] Into cultural idolatry
[2639.36 → 2639.78] And
[2639.78 → 2641.02] As Pastor Ed
[2641.02 → 2641.62] Already mentioned
[2641.62 → 2642.32] False teaching
[2642.32 → 2643.30] In fact
[2643.30 → 2643.68] If you read
[2643.68 → 2644.56] This passage further
[2644.56 → 2645.48] One of Paul's
[2645.48 → 2646.26] Great concerns
[2646.26 → 2647.14] Is that all the
[2647.14 → 2647.86] Shiny new
[2647.86 → 2648.96] Fascinating ideas
[2648.96 → 2649.56] Of the church
[2649.56 → 2650.18] Of Ephesus
[2650.18 → 2650.78] As a city
[2650.78 → 2651.86] Doesn't influence
[2651.86 → 2652.30] The church
[2652.30 → 2653.64] Away from the scriptures
[2653.64 → 2655.18] From the faithful teaching
[2655.18 → 2656.66] And so he says
[2656.66 → 2657.20] To the leaders
[2657.20 → 2659.58] Watch over the flock
[2659.58 → 2661.20] Keep close eye
[2661.20 → 2661.70] On them
[2661.70 → 2662.80] And shepherd them
[2662.80 → 2664.60] I will only share
[2664.60 → 2665.62] Briefly about shepherding
[2665.62 → 2666.36] Because Pastor Ed
[2666.36 → 2667.30] Stole half of my sermon
[2667.30 → 2668.42] But I think it's
[2668.42 → 2669.42] A pretty rich image
[2669.42 → 2670.82] Multifaceted
[2670.82 → 2671.16] Right
[2671.16 → 2672.04] To shepherd
[2672.04 → 2673.28] Is to lead
[2673.28 → 2674.12] To shepherd
[2674.12 → 2675.32] Is to make sure
[2675.32 → 2675.84] That the sheep
[2675.84 → 2676.60] Are being fed
[2676.60 → 2677.28] And nourished
[2677.28 → 2678.32] To shepherd
[2678.32 → 2679.60] Is to care
[2679.60 → 2681.96] And I still remember
[2681.96 → 2682.34] Jonathan
[2682.34 → 2682.84] When you came
[2682.84 → 2683.58] Into our church
[2683.58 → 2685.26] We could tell
[2685.26 → 2685.66] Right away
[2685.66 → 2686.50] That you loved
[2686.50 → 2687.06] The church
[2687.06 → 2688.36] That God has given
[2688.36 → 2689.22] You a shepherd's
[2689.22 → 2689.60] Heart
[2689.60 → 2690.76] For the church
[2690.76 → 2691.24] In fact
[2691.24 → 2691.88] I think you learned
[2691.88 → 2692.54] It from your dad
[2692.54 → 2693.56] Who's sitting
[2693.56 → 2694.40] Right beside you
[2694.40 → 2696.44] And it might be worth
[2696.44 → 2696.96] Just sharing
[2696.96 → 2697.58] One conversation
[2697.58 → 2698.30] I had with a
[2698.30 → 2698.82] Regent prof
[2698.82 → 2699.66] About Jonathan
[2699.66 → 2700.48] When he started
[2700.48 → 2701.10] His internship
[2701.10 → 2702.36] The prof said
[2702.36 → 2702.56] You know
[2702.56 → 2703.12] As I look at
[2703.12 → 2703.50] Jonathan
[2703.50 → 2704.62] As fit for ministry
[2704.62 → 2705.14] In his various
[2705.14 → 2705.56] Gifting
[2705.56 → 2705.78] He's like
[2705.78 → 2707.06] That's the kind
[2707.06 → 2707.58] Of person
[2707.58 → 2708.34] Who's going
[2708.34 → 2709.08] To love
[2709.08 → 2710.02] The church
[2710.02 → 2711.06] To life
[2711.06 → 2712.62] He's going
[2712.62 → 2712.98] To be the kind
[2712.98 → 2713.38] Of pastor
[2713.38 → 2714.44] Who shows up
[2714.44 → 2715.14] When there's
[2715.14 → 2715.76] Celebration
[2715.76 → 2716.76] Who disciples
[2716.76 → 2717.70] When there's
[2717.70 → 2718.16] Hardship
[2718.16 → 2718.68] Who knows
[2718.68 → 2719.26] How to lament
[2719.26 → 2719.70] And pray
[2719.70 → 2720.16] With those
[2720.16 → 2720.50] Who go
[2720.50 → 2721.06] Through crisis
[2721.06 → 2721.62] And hardship
[2721.62 → 2722.56] And Jonathan
[2722.56 → 2723.34] I think that's true
[2723.34 → 2724.66] God's given you
[2724.66 → 2725.42] A shepherd's heart
[2725.42 → 2725.90] And our church
[2725.90 → 2727.06] Is blessed by it
[2727.06 → 2729.40] But let me finish
[2729.40 → 2730.32] By talking about this
[2730.32 → 2730.70] That's right
[2730.70 → 2731.30] I'm already about
[2731.30 → 2731.80] To finish
[2731.80 → 2734.20] Did you notice
[2734.20 → 2734.84] How Paul
[2734.84 → 2735.64] Describes
[2735.64 → 2736.34] The church
[2736.34 → 2737.82] He didn't say
[2737.82 → 2738.60] It was his church
[2738.60 → 2739.38] Which is tempting
[2739.38 → 2740.14] He planted it
[2740.14 → 2740.72] After all
[2740.72 → 2741.44] He didn't say
[2741.44 → 2741.76] The church
[2741.76 → 2742.58] Belonged to the
[2742.58 → 2743.34] Leaders in Ephesus
[2743.34 → 2744.02] Which would also
[2744.02 → 2744.52] Be tempting
[2744.52 → 2745.06] For them to think
[2745.06 → 2745.38] They have an
[2745.38 → 2746.18] Ownership over it
[2746.18 → 2746.70] He says
[2746.70 → 2747.20] This church
[2747.20 → 2748.32] Belongs to God
[2748.32 → 2749.46] Who bought it
[2749.46 → 2750.40] With his own
[2750.40 → 2751.18] Blood
[2751.18 → 2753.40] He owns it
[2753.40 → 2754.36] And I think
[2754.36 → 2755.06] That's a really
[2755.06 → 2755.98] Strong warning
[2755.98 → 2757.38] And it's a deep
[2757.38 → 2757.96] Encouragement
[2757.96 → 2758.88] And it totally
[2758.88 → 2759.68] Changes the way
[2759.68 → 2760.34] We lead
[2760.34 → 2761.30] In the church
[2761.30 → 2762.94] Here's an illustration
[2762.94 → 2763.80] That might be helpful
[2763.80 → 2765.24] Think of the way
[2765.24 → 2766.30] You drive your own
[2766.30 → 2766.62] Car
[2766.62 → 2767.82] Or van
[2767.82 → 2769.34] And think of how
[2769.34 → 2770.18] Differently you drive
[2770.18 → 2771.14] Someone else's van
[2771.14 → 2772.34] Don't think about
[2772.34 → 2772.88] Rentals
[2772.88 → 2773.68] That it is own
[2773.68 → 2774.12] Category
[2774.12 → 2774.86] We drive rentals
[2774.86 → 2775.40] Very differently
[2775.40 → 2776.50] But if you borrow
[2776.50 → 2777.32] Someone else's vehicle
[2777.32 → 2778.62] You see it differently
[2778.62 → 2779.38] Or if you
[2779.38 → 2780.36] Think of how you live
[2780.36 → 2781.08] In your own home
[2781.08 → 2781.72] Versus how you live
[2781.72 → 2782.56] In someone else's home
[2782.56 → 2783.92] When you're in their
[2783.92 → 2784.38] Space
[2784.38 → 2785.32] You're attentive to how
[2785.32 → 2786.48] They would live in their home
[2786.48 → 2787.48] Their concerns
[2787.48 → 2788.60] For how it should be managed
[2788.60 → 2789.74] And so it is
[2789.74 → 2790.96] With pastors in the church
[2790.96 → 2792.70] You don't get to do
[2792.70 → 2793.54] Whatever you want
[2793.54 → 2794.78] You don't just get to
[2794.78 → 2795.46] Call the shots
[2795.46 → 2796.46] The way you see fit
[2796.46 → 2797.72] You must as a leader
[2797.72 → 2799.40] Discern what God's vision is
[2799.40 → 2800.08] For his family
[2800.08 → 2800.66] The church
[2800.66 → 2803.08] His desire for that body
[2803.08 → 2804.00] And you must lead
[2804.00 → 2804.70] In a way that
[2804.70 → 2805.82] Honours those intentions
[2805.82 → 2807.64] That's the calling
[2807.64 → 2808.70] Of a shepherd
[2808.70 → 2809.68] In the church
[2809.68 → 2812.22] And maybe I want to
[2812.22 → 2812.80] Marvel with you
[2812.80 → 2813.26] For a minute
[2813.26 → 2814.46] That we're here
[2814.46 → 2816.18] You know
[2816.18 → 2816.90] Think about this
[2816.90 → 2817.72] Humanly speaking
[2817.72 → 2819.22] It's hard to explain
[2819.22 → 2820.24] Why the church exists
[2820.24 → 2821.38] Here we are
[2821.38 → 2822.86] 2,023 years
[2822.86 → 2824.46] After Jesus was on earth
[2824.46 → 2825.60] And here we are
[2825.60 → 2827.20] Worshipping in British Columbia
[2827.20 → 2829.06] Along with many believers
[2829.06 → 2829.70] In our city
[2829.70 → 2831.80] With millions of believers
[2831.80 → 2832.68] Who have already gathered
[2832.68 → 2833.22] For worship
[2833.22 → 2834.14] Throughout the world
[2834.14 → 2835.28] With believers
[2835.28 → 2836.20] Throughout the generations
[2836.20 → 2837.10] Who gather
[2837.10 → 2838.68] To worship the name of Christ
[2838.68 → 2840.20] There's no shortage
[2840.20 → 2840.98] Of things that threaten
[2840.98 → 2841.52] The church
[2841.52 → 2842.52] Conflict
[2842.52 → 2842.96] Division
[2842.96 → 2843.72] False teaching
[2843.72 → 2845.06] Toxic leadership
[2845.06 → 2846.22] Persecution
[2846.22 → 2847.20] All the rest
[2847.20 → 2847.92] And yet here
[2847.92 → 2849.46] We are
[2849.46 → 2851.72] Praise the Lord
[2851.72 → 2852.14] For that
[2852.14 → 2853.32] And I think
[2853.32 → 2853.84] There's only one
[2853.84 → 2854.72] Explanation that makes
[2854.72 → 2855.44] Sense of the existence
[2855.44 → 2856.04] Of the church
[2856.04 → 2856.64] And that is
[2856.64 → 2857.50] The empty tomb
[2857.50 → 2859.68] The resurrection of Jesus
[2859.68 → 2860.52] Is what makes
[2860.52 → 2861.64] The church exist
[2861.64 → 2864.26] It's the fact that
[2864.26 → 2865.00] This church
[2865.00 → 2866.18] Belongs
[2866.18 → 2867.60] To God
[2867.60 → 2868.82] He's the one
[2868.82 → 2869.60] Who formed it
[2869.60 → 2870.02] He's the one
[2870.02 → 2870.82] Who called the church
[2870.82 → 2871.42] To himself
[2871.42 → 2871.94] Through the work
[2871.94 → 2872.88] Of Jesus on the cross
[2872.88 → 2874.04] And he's the one
[2874.04 → 2875.06] Who will hold it
[2875.06 → 2876.62] Through eternity
[2876.62 → 2877.96] It's not on your
[2877.96 → 2878.72] Shoulders Jonathan
[2878.72 → 2880.34] The church does not
[2880.34 → 2881.18] Belong to us
[2881.18 → 2882.16] As pastors and leaders
[2882.16 → 2883.20] The church belongs
[2883.20 → 2883.72] To God
[2883.72 → 2884.96] And it's in his
[2884.96 → 2886.22] Powerful hands
[2886.22 → 2888.88] It's filled with
[2888.88 → 2889.70] God's spirit
[2889.70 → 2891.30] It's given the life
[2891.30 → 2892.30] Of the resurrection
[2892.30 → 2892.78] Of Jesus
[2892.78 → 2893.92] That's why by the way
[2893.92 → 2895.40] You can expect
[2895.40 → 2896.74] For lives to be changed
[2896.74 → 2897.86] When they come to a church
[2897.86 → 2899.56] You can expect
[2899.56 → 2900.60] That cold hearts
[2900.60 → 2901.20] Are warmed
[2901.20 → 2902.26] By the power of the gospel
[2902.26 → 2903.56] You can expect
[2903.56 → 2905.12] That rebellious hearts
[2905.12 → 2905.90] Receive grace
[2905.90 → 2906.54] And forgiveness
[2906.54 → 2907.58] In the church
[2907.58 → 2908.22] You can expect
[2908.22 → 2909.26] That divided hearts
[2909.26 → 2910.54] And divided families
[2910.54 → 2911.62] Experience reconciliation
[2911.62 → 2912.28] Why?
[2912.74 → 2914.32] Because this is the community
[2914.32 → 2915.54] Where the resurrection
[2915.54 → 2916.62] Of Jesus Christ
[2916.62 → 2917.44] Is at work
[2917.44 → 2920.36] And perhaps I'll say
[2920.36 → 2921.14] Jonathan to you
[2921.14 → 2922.10] What Pastor Sid said
[2922.10 → 2922.52] To me
[2922.52 → 2923.48] At my commissioning
[2923.48 → 2925.68] That the church
[2925.68 → 2927.20] Has existed before
[2927.20 → 2928.02] We were here
[2928.02 → 2930.04] Not just the local church
[2930.04 → 2931.06] But the global church
[2931.06 → 2932.72] And it's going to exist
[2932.72 → 2935.06] Way after we finish ministry
[2935.06 → 2936.50] And retire and perish
[2936.50 → 2939.96] And God generously invites you
[2939.96 → 2941.24] To serve it for a season
[2941.24 → 2943.80] To quote the pastor
[2943.80 → 2944.64] At the very beginning
[2944.64 → 2945.78] It is a privilege
[2945.78 → 2947.30] To pastor
[2947.30 → 2948.82] And to know that
[2948.82 → 2949.68] It doesn't hold
[2949.68 → 2950.46] In your hands
[2950.46 → 2951.58] It's in God's hands
[2951.58 → 2952.92] And we take great comfort
[2952.92 → 2953.42] That Jesus
[2953.42 → 2954.46] When he looks at Peter
[2954.46 → 2956.34] One of his very first believers
[2956.34 → 2957.42] He says to Peter
[2957.42 → 2958.68] I'm going to start with you
[2958.68 → 2960.38] And I'm going to build my church
[2960.38 → 2962.22] And not even the gates of hell
[2962.22 → 2963.50] And all the power of evil
[2963.50 → 2965.18] Can stand against
[2965.18 → 2967.86] The body that I have bought
[2967.86 → 2968.80] Through the cross
[2968.80 → 2970.82] The body that I freely give
[2970.82 → 2972.20] The life of my resurrection
[2972.20 → 2974.96] And Jonathan
[2974.96 → 2975.64] We praise the Lord
[2975.64 → 2976.44] That God brought you
[2976.44 → 2976.94] And your family
[2976.94 → 2977.66] To our church
[2977.66 → 2980.18] We pray that you preach
[2980.18 → 2981.16] The gospel of the kingdom
[2981.16 → 2981.76] Faithfully
[2981.76 → 2983.62] We pray that you watch
[2983.62 → 2984.40] Over your life
[2984.40 → 2986.24] And shepherd this flock
[2986.24 → 2988.10] And we trust
[2988.10 → 2989.16] That God owns it
[2989.16 → 2990.82] God will lead it
[2990.82 → 2991.84] He will use your gifts
[2991.84 → 2992.48] Within it
[2992.48 → 2993.64] And he will receive
[2993.64 → 2994.60] All the praise
[2994.60 → 2995.48] For what happens
[2995.48 → 2996.20] In this church
[2996.20 → 2997.78] Would you join me in prayer
[2997.78 → 3003.90] Father we thank you
[3003.90 → 3004.48] For the privilege
[3004.48 → 3005.82] Of being part of your family
[3005.82 → 3008.10] We pause to praise you
[3008.10 → 3009.16] For our own conversions
[3009.16 → 3010.70] For the grace
[3010.70 → 3012.12] That invaded our lives
[3012.12 → 3012.72] And brought us
[3012.72 → 3013.40] Into your family
[3013.40 → 3015.96] We pray Lord
[3015.96 → 3017.50] That we would be faithful
[3017.50 → 3018.16] As your body
[3018.16 → 3019.84] That we would make
[3019.84 → 3020.40] The life
[3020.40 → 3021.06] The love
[3021.06 → 3022.24] The power of Jesus
[3022.24 → 3023.40] Known in our lives
[3023.40 → 3023.96] Our city
[3023.96 → 3025.18] Our workplaces
[3025.18 → 3026.94] And we ask that you
[3026.94 → 3028.00] Would guide our leaders
[3028.00 → 3029.18] Our elders
[3029.18 → 3030.00] Our deacons
[3030.00 → 3030.76] Our staff
[3030.76 → 3031.54] And our pastors
[3031.54 → 3033.48] To faithfully shepherd
[3033.48 → 3034.24] This flock
[3034.24 → 3035.88] To faithful ministry
[3035.88 → 3037.62] To you be all the glory
[3037.62 → 3038.44] Amen
[3038.44 → 3040.90] Would you stand
[3040.90 → 3041.46] And sing with me
[3041.46 → 3042.52] A song of comfort
[3042.52 → 3044.16] Yet not I
[3044.16 → 3045.18] But Christ in me
[3045.18 → 3045.36] Amen
[3045.36 → 3045.86] Amen
[3045.86 → 3045.92] Amen
[3045.92 → 3045.98] Amen
[3045.98 → 3046.06] Amen
[3046.06 → 3046.08] Amen
[3046.08 → 3046.16] Amen
[3046.16 → 3046.18] Amen
[3046.18 → 3046.20] Amen
