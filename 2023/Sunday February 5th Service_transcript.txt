[0.00 --> 3.10]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[6.74 --> 10.42]  I don't know if you've noticed this, but it seems to me that whenever Jonathan leads worship,
[10.54 --> 13.64]  there's like a new person helping lead worship, and his team is growing each week.
[13.76 --> 15.80]  It's a spiritual gift of building worship teams.
[16.48 --> 19.58]  But I just want to say thank you to Jonathan and the team for leading us in worship.
[20.00 --> 21.82]  And, Sonia, thank you for leading us in prayer.
[23.26 --> 25.86]  As was already mentioned, we're in the middle of a series on the book of Jonah.
[25.86 --> 31.46]  And I want to also say that it's been really encouraging to hear a lot of the feedback from our small groups and individuals
[31.46 --> 33.26]  about how this book is interacting with you.
[33.38 --> 37.64]  I even got this morning an email about a story of a guy who was swallowed by a whale.
[37.78 --> 40.66]  I was like, okay, people are really interacting with this book.
[41.14 --> 42.80]  And I'm encouraged to hear even stories.
[42.92 --> 47.50]  Someone came up to me a couple weeks ago after we preached on how God does a lot with a little.
[48.12 --> 50.68]  He shared with me how God used him in someone's journey of coming to faith.
[50.68 --> 54.86]  And it's an encouragement to us to hear how God's word is interacting with our community and with you as individuals.
[54.86 --> 56.08]  So please keep doing that.
[56.66 --> 57.90]  And we're going to jump right in.
[58.92 --> 62.50]  Jonah 1 is about God receiving or Jonah getting a call from the Lord to go to Nineveh.
[62.72 --> 63.78]  He runs from that call.
[63.94 --> 64.88]  God brings him back.
[65.54 --> 66.72]  Brings him back to the calling.
[66.88 --> 69.18]  He spits him out on the ground to go back to Nineveh.
[69.36 --> 73.40]  And now we're getting to the part of the story that most children's Bible stories don't talk about.
[73.48 --> 75.56]  That is Jonah going to Nineveh.
[75.90 --> 78.82]  So if you have your Bible, we're going to read Jonah 3 together.
[84.86 --> 89.18]  Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time.
[90.04 --> 93.94]  Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.
[94.96 --> 97.28]  Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and went to Nineveh.
[98.18 --> 99.84]  Now Nineveh was a very large city.
[100.28 --> 102.36]  It took three days to go around it.
[102.94 --> 105.58]  Jonah began by going a day's journey into the city proclaiming,
[105.96 --> 108.32]  Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.
[109.24 --> 111.36]  The Ninevites believed God.
[111.36 --> 115.82]  They declared a fast and all of them from the greatest to the least put on sackcloth.
[116.38 --> 120.12]  When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne,
[120.68 --> 125.28]  took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.
[126.26 --> 128.42]  Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh.
[129.14 --> 130.84]  By decree of the king and his nobles,
[131.28 --> 134.62]  do not let people or animals, herds or flock, taste anything.
[135.20 --> 139.38]  Do not let them eat or drink, but let people and animals be covered with sackcloth.
[139.38 --> 142.72]  Let everyone call urgently on God.
[143.08 --> 145.26]  Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.
[145.64 --> 146.40]  Who knows?
[146.94 --> 153.48]  God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.
[154.68 --> 158.16]  When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways,
[158.82 --> 163.10]  he relented and he did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened.
[163.10 --> 171.62]  A little while ago, my son and I, Levi, were watching one of those TSN Top 10 hockey videos.
[171.84 --> 172.98]  I don't know if any of you have seen those.
[173.74 --> 177.56]  And this TSN Top hockey video is all about like unexpected moments in hockey.
[178.14 --> 180.34]  And one of those videos was just amazing.
[180.62 --> 182.04]  And here's what was going on in the video.
[182.12 --> 184.88]  It was a game between Chicago and Colorado.
[184.88 --> 190.66]  And in the middle of the first period, one of the players on Colorado got a high stick right in the face of a Chicago player.
[191.10 --> 195.16]  And it was cut right here and he's bleeding and a trainer gave him a cloth so he's covering the blood.
[195.54 --> 198.12]  And as he goes back to the bench to get off the ice,
[198.44 --> 203.38]  there is a fan who's smashing his hands against the glass and he's making fun of this player.
[203.70 --> 205.90]  He's mocking him, calling things that I can't repeat,
[205.90 --> 208.86]  and sort of making this player look like a whip for needing this, you know,
[208.94 --> 210.78]  this cloth recovering the blood on his face.
[211.74 --> 215.16]  Well, the very next period comes and the goalie on the Colorado team,
[215.28 --> 217.64]  he has to clear the puck out of his own and he shoots it up.
[217.98 --> 221.34]  And wouldn't you know, it goes over the glass and guess who it hits right in the head?
[222.30 --> 223.08]  That fan.
[223.62 --> 226.76]  And you wouldn't know, like his girlfriend, at least so the video says,
[226.82 --> 231.00]  his girlfriend grabs the cloth and now he's sitting in his seat with the cloth against his face
[231.00 --> 234.50]  and the Colorado, sorry, the Chicago Blackhawks player can't handle it.
[234.50 --> 236.94]  He just goes up to the bench and he points right at him.
[237.86 --> 239.44]  Sweet revenge, right?
[240.18 --> 241.94]  That guy had what was getting to him.
[241.96 --> 244.88]  And even when we watched that video, we were just smirking with that sense of delight,
[244.96 --> 246.64]  like this guy got what was coming to him.
[246.90 --> 248.80]  If you want to see the video, it's called Hockey Karma.
[250.64 --> 251.44]  It's actually...
[251.44 --> 256.90]  We said at the beginning of this series that Jonah is a mirror for Israel, right?
[257.14 --> 258.60]  He represents Israel.
[258.60 --> 261.44]  And Israel hated Assyria.
[261.44 --> 265.68]  Israel, in some sense, as they'd be reading this story, are saying, yes.
[266.22 --> 269.00]  Jonah now gets to go to Nineveh and he gets to give it to them.
[269.62 --> 274.02]  He gets to give them a message of doom because destruction is coming their way.
[275.14 --> 279.04]  And the readers, including, you know, the experience of Jonah himself,
[279.18 --> 280.18]  they're going to have a surprise.
[280.62 --> 282.42]  There's a big surprise coming in this passage.
[283.54 --> 286.26]  Now, you need to know that Jonah 3 is sort of a mirror of Jonah 1.
[286.26 --> 291.02]  In fact, this whole book cuts in two, and there's huge parallels between 1 and 2 and 3 and 4.
[291.82 --> 294.32]  Jonah starts by hearing the word of the Lord, and he runs, right?
[294.36 --> 295.18]  He goes to the ship.
[295.60 --> 296.70]  The sailors encounter God.
[296.82 --> 297.50]  Jonah's thrown overboard.
[297.78 --> 300.32]  God takes Jonah with the great fish, spits him out.
[300.52 --> 304.06]  And then we get to chapter 3, which starts almost the exact same way, right?
[304.14 --> 307.12]  The word of the Lord comes to Jonah a second time.
[308.10 --> 309.24]  And we see a repetition.
[309.46 --> 310.82]  And I think it's important to say now,
[310.88 --> 313.52]  you're going to hear about this more next week when we preach on Jonah 4.
[313.52 --> 316.60]  But just because Jonah is reborn, you might say,
[316.66 --> 319.60]  and he gets a second chance to preach God's word to Nineveh,
[319.78 --> 322.12]  that does not mean that Jonah is transformed.
[323.02 --> 325.88]  Just because he's obeying the word of the Lord and going into Nineveh
[325.88 --> 327.42]  doesn't mean he's not dragging his feet,
[327.50 --> 329.98]  and it doesn't mean that he loves that city.
[330.88 --> 332.74]  In fact, I have a hunch, along with many other people,
[332.84 --> 337.14]  that Jonah is still living with a deep sense of resentment and hatred
[337.14 --> 340.84]  and a desire for these people to get that sweet revenge,
[340.84 --> 345.72]  to get what's coming to them because this is a wicked, pagan, violent city,
[345.84 --> 351.22]  and Israelites have good reason to resent the Assyrians and Nineveh, the capital.
[352.16 --> 353.56]  So let's take a look at our passage together.
[354.22 --> 356.76]  It starts, as I already mentioned, with God speaking to Jonah,
[356.82 --> 358.00]  and this is what he says to him.
[358.00 --> 358.18]  He says,
[358.18 --> 361.26]  Go to the great city, the large city of Nineveh,
[361.40 --> 363.98]  and proclaim to it the message I give to you.
[364.86 --> 366.62]  Now, it's important to know that in this passage,
[366.98 --> 369.66]  some translations say large city, some say great city.
[369.66 --> 371.88]  I prefer great because it's a double meaning on that word.
[371.96 --> 373.66]  It's a great city in terms of its size.
[374.16 --> 376.80]  It was known already then as the emerging capital of Assyria.
[377.18 --> 379.80]  It sort of had established a reputation for itself.
[380.14 --> 383.52]  But it's also great in terms of its influence and its impact.
[383.88 --> 387.14]  It's known, and not just in the eyes of other cities that were smaller than it,
[387.66 --> 389.00]  but it's noticed by God.
[389.72 --> 391.32]  It's a great city to God.
[392.12 --> 394.44]  The people who dwelled there are his image bearers.
[394.50 --> 398.36]  The economic, social, relational decisions that have a huge influence on that city
[398.36 --> 401.70]  have an influence on the people God created, a city that he cares about.
[402.56 --> 405.20]  And it's a reminder, I think, actually the whole book of Jonah is a reminder
[405.20 --> 406.90]  that God cares about cities.
[407.62 --> 409.66]  And not just cities then, but cities now.
[410.12 --> 413.20]  You know, Jonah might hate Nineveh, but God is concerned for it.
[413.92 --> 416.00]  Christians might not like the cities they live in.
[416.08 --> 418.72]  Churches might sort of segregate themselves from the cities they live in.
[418.74 --> 421.54]  But God is concerned for the cities.
[422.30 --> 424.04]  He's concerned when those cities are violent,
[424.04 --> 426.58]  their laws are unjust, and people are oppressed.
[426.94 --> 428.12]  And that's true today.
[428.98 --> 430.58]  God's concerned for Clayton Heights.
[430.84 --> 431.28]  Do you know that?
[431.94 --> 434.48]  God's concerned for Cloverdale, Langley, and Surrey.
[434.54 --> 436.66]  And I can even say, the place that people make fun of,
[436.70 --> 437.90]  God is concerned for Wally.
[438.82 --> 440.28]  You know, whenever you ask someone in Surrey where they're from,
[440.34 --> 442.86]  they always say, oh, I'm from Clayton, I'm from Fleetwood.
[442.90 --> 444.32]  And when people say they're, when they live in Wally,
[444.40 --> 445.30]  they say, I'm from Surrey.
[445.62 --> 446.54]  But they're from Wally.
[446.78 --> 449.64]  And God is concerned and has a love for that place in Surrey.
[450.04 --> 451.92]  For those of you who live there, big shout out to you.
[451.92 --> 455.92]  And so Jonah listens this time.
[456.48 --> 457.14]  He's humbled.
[457.72 --> 459.12]  He knows what happened when he ran away.
[459.20 --> 460.54]  And this time he actually goes to Nineveh.
[460.64 --> 463.32]  And I've often wondered, what was it like for Jonah to walk to Nineveh?
[463.86 --> 465.36]  You know, after this whole scene of running
[465.36 --> 467.56]  and having this dramatic experience of being rescued,
[467.62 --> 468.58]  what was it like for Jonah?
[469.10 --> 472.84]  And there's one writer who suggests that the sort of the three days
[472.84 --> 475.50]  in the belly of the fish and the three days to go around Nineveh
[475.50 --> 476.42]  are not accidental.
[477.22 --> 479.06]  And he suggests that Jonah is, in one sense,
[479.06 --> 481.76]  going from the belly of one beast into the belly of another beast.
[482.40 --> 483.82]  That second beast is Assyria.
[484.58 --> 486.62]  We've said from the beginning that Syria is,
[486.98 --> 488.44]  Nineveh is a wicked city.
[488.60 --> 490.22]  Like, the wickedness is real.
[490.40 --> 491.26]  And I just learned this week,
[491.32 --> 492.96]  there's actually a lot of archaeological evidence
[492.96 --> 494.22]  about Assyria and Nineveh.
[494.66 --> 496.24]  And the king's palace in Nineveh,
[496.40 --> 498.36]  they've recovered a lot of pieces from this palace.
[498.46 --> 499.56]  And he had on the entrance,
[499.66 --> 500.18]  and you can picture this,
[500.18 --> 501.68]  the entrance as you walk into his palace,
[502.04 --> 502.56]  a wall.
[502.68 --> 505.34]  And on that wall was all the military exploits
[505.34 --> 507.76]  and the victories that that Assyrian king had won.
[508.14 --> 510.54]  And it showed in very gory, gruesome detail
[510.54 --> 512.54]  the way that he would kill all his enemies
[512.54 --> 516.66]  and the way they would dismember or burn or impale all the enemies.
[517.32 --> 519.12]  And you can imagine what it would be like for Jonah to think,
[519.22 --> 520.52]  that's where I'm going.
[521.38 --> 524.90]  I also learned this week that the reason Jonah probably had no worries
[524.90 --> 527.12]  for his life going into the city is because he's a prophet.
[528.24 --> 529.50]  Most people, if they're not a prophet,
[529.50 --> 532.34]  should be worried that they just walk into Nineveh as an outsider
[532.34 --> 533.92]  and would, you know, have their life threatened.
[534.00 --> 535.40]  But Jonah, because he was a prophet,
[535.80 --> 537.52]  and prophets were treated with special respect
[537.52 --> 539.72]  because they spoke on behalf of the gods,
[540.26 --> 541.10]  Jonah could do this.
[542.04 --> 543.20]  So he goes into the city,
[543.26 --> 544.46]  and he preaches what I call
[544.46 --> 546.34]  the world's shortest doomsday sermon.
[547.10 --> 549.86]  If only Sid and Dave and Jonathan's sermons were this short.
[550.42 --> 553.40]  It's five Hebrew words, right?
[553.46 --> 555.30]  He goes into the city, he preaches five Hebrew words,
[555.34 --> 556.70]  and I want to put them on the screen for us.
[557.22 --> 557.88]  This is what he says,
[557.88 --> 561.04]  40 more days, and Nineveh will be overthrown.
[561.92 --> 564.86]  That is the shortest sermon you could possibly imagine.
[564.94 --> 567.06]  Like his whole ministry, all he's been running away from,
[567.28 --> 569.84]  comes down to this tiny doomsday sermon.
[570.94 --> 571.98]  And, you know, just imagine him.
[571.98 --> 572.98]  He walks a day into the city,
[573.06 --> 574.68]  and it's probably that he just walks around,
[574.78 --> 576.02]  whoever would hear, and just say,
[576.14 --> 578.44]  40 more days, and Nineveh will be overthrown.
[579.72 --> 582.00]  And as with all things in Jonah, the book of Jonah,
[582.06 --> 584.16]  there's a lot of debate about this tiny little sermon.
[584.16 --> 586.90]  Because people have said, that's a strange sermon.
[587.58 --> 588.72]  For two particular reasons.
[588.80 --> 589.16]  You know why?
[589.22 --> 591.18]  The first reason, you can keep it on the screen,
[591.26 --> 592.22]  this is a strange sermon,
[592.38 --> 595.44]  is because Jonah never says why.
[596.56 --> 599.54]  He never says, hey, Nineveh, you are a violent, wicked city,
[599.64 --> 602.22]  and my God, he's learned about this wickedness,
[602.28 --> 603.50]  is he's going to judge you accordingly.
[603.60 --> 604.90]  There's nothing mentioned about the why.
[605.30 --> 607.52]  Nor is God's name even invoked.
[608.00 --> 610.30]  Jonah doesn't even say who's doing the overthrowing.
[610.30 --> 613.32]  He just says, in 40 more days, you're going to get overthrown.
[613.38 --> 614.44]  And the word there, overthrown,
[614.52 --> 616.22]  is the same word we see in Genesis 19
[616.22 --> 618.88]  to describe Sodom and Gomorrah,
[619.38 --> 621.82]  two cities that were most certainly overthrown.
[622.76 --> 624.20]  Some will say, hey, Jonah probably heard
[624.20 --> 625.18]  a different word from the Lord,
[625.42 --> 627.38]  but he gave them only what he wanted to share.
[627.44 --> 628.62]  I'm not sure if that's true or not.
[628.96 --> 631.80]  Even if this is exactly what God told Jonah to say,
[632.28 --> 634.26]  we can learn from already in Jonah 1
[634.26 --> 636.12]  that God can do a lot with a little.
[637.24 --> 639.58]  He can use the words of a prophet who hates the city,
[639.58 --> 641.04]  who wants them to be overthrown.
[641.34 --> 644.40]  And he can use those words to cause a profound effect.
[645.18 --> 646.74]  And if you look at verse 5,
[646.88 --> 648.70]  which I think in some sense is the climax
[648.70 --> 649.62]  of this whole passage,
[650.14 --> 651.40]  we hear these stunning words.
[651.50 --> 653.54]  Words Jonah couldn't even believe himself, I'm sure,
[653.64 --> 654.56]  were, it says,
[655.24 --> 656.34]  the Ninevites, what?
[657.68 --> 659.28]  Believed in God.
[660.56 --> 661.72]  No one saw that coming.
[662.20 --> 662.96]  And more than that,
[663.02 --> 665.24]  there's action to sort of go with this belief in God.
[665.32 --> 666.16]  They started fasting,
[666.38 --> 667.92]  and they started putting on sackcloth.
[667.92 --> 670.26]  And if you're curious what this thing about sackcloth is,
[670.30 --> 672.48]  it's kind of like just putting a burlap bag on.
[672.98 --> 674.64]  And the reason for doing that is to say,
[674.76 --> 675.34]  you're serious.
[675.42 --> 676.54]  You want to make yourself uncomfortable.
[676.68 --> 677.96]  You want to withhold food and drink.
[678.20 --> 679.44]  You want to humble yourself
[679.44 --> 681.14]  to show that you are serious
[681.14 --> 683.78]  about the response to this word of doom.
[684.90 --> 686.20]  The Ninevites are humbling themselves.
[686.90 --> 688.32]  But there's more surprises, right?
[688.54 --> 690.22]  The news goes from the Ninevites
[690.22 --> 692.10]  who respond to Jonah all the way to the king.
[692.16 --> 693.32]  Remember that king with the palace,
[693.64 --> 694.76]  with that wall decorating,
[694.76 --> 697.48]  and sort of celebrating all his gory exploits.
[697.78 --> 698.70]  The king, what does he do?
[700.16 --> 702.04]  Gets off his throne,
[702.84 --> 704.58]  takes off his robe,
[704.96 --> 706.36]  goes down into the dust,
[706.48 --> 708.16]  and he joins the fasting
[708.16 --> 709.70]  and the repenting of his city.
[709.78 --> 711.08]  I mean, can you even imagine that scene?
[711.78 --> 712.82]  Kings in this time,
[712.94 --> 714.58]  they were considered representatives of the gods.
[714.66 --> 716.24]  They had a tremendous amount of power.
[716.54 --> 718.14]  And here's a king who disrobes
[718.14 --> 720.04]  and brings himself on the level
[720.04 --> 722.50]  of everybody else in repentance and humility.
[722.96 --> 724.14]  I mean, I can't even imagine
[724.14 --> 726.12]  prime ministers and presidents of today's day
[726.12 --> 727.26]  doing anything close to this.
[727.80 --> 729.10]  And more than that, what does he do?
[729.18 --> 730.28]  He then issues a decree.
[730.48 --> 731.68]  I want to read for us the decree
[731.68 --> 732.92]  because he's serious about this.
[732.98 --> 733.28]  He says,
[733.38 --> 735.28]  Do not let people or animals,
[735.72 --> 736.46]  strange detail,
[736.74 --> 737.66]  herds or flocks,
[737.94 --> 738.66]  taste anything.
[739.22 --> 740.52]  Do not let them eat or drink,
[740.62 --> 741.68]  but let people and animals
[741.68 --> 743.02]  be covered with sackcloth.
[743.30 --> 746.16]  Let everyone call urgently on God.
[746.94 --> 747.72]  Let them give up.
[747.72 --> 749.40]  This is the first time we receive the confession.
[749.54 --> 752.00]  Give up their evil ways and their violence.
[752.70 --> 753.94]  And then the question at the end,
[754.38 --> 755.56]  Who knows?
[756.84 --> 758.94]  God may yet relent with compassion,
[759.72 --> 761.02]  turn from his fierce anger,
[761.46 --> 763.14]  so that we will not perish.
[765.30 --> 766.88]  Now, I find that last line
[766.88 --> 768.36]  is one that catches a lot of people's attention.
[768.94 --> 769.56]  Who knows?
[770.14 --> 771.28]  God may yet relent,
[771.28 --> 773.84]  and with compassion turn from his fierce anger,
[774.46 --> 775.66]  and we will not perish.
[775.66 --> 777.98]  And I want to pause on that passage.
[778.08 --> 778.66]  And the reason is,
[778.74 --> 780.48]  whenever I preach on anything related
[780.48 --> 781.86]  to God's anger or judgment,
[782.00 --> 782.96]  I get lots of questions.
[783.20 --> 783.82]  And rightfully so.
[784.40 --> 785.84]  There's people who did not grow up in the church,
[786.02 --> 787.86]  who are not familiar well with the Old Testament,
[788.16 --> 790.22]  and when we read anything related to God
[790.22 --> 791.58]  having a fierce anger,
[791.68 --> 793.26]  under which humans can perish,
[793.36 --> 793.66]  there's like,
[793.76 --> 793.98]  Whoa,
[794.26 --> 796.28]  how does that relate to his love,
[796.36 --> 796.98]  his compassion,
[797.14 --> 797.64]  his grace?
[797.98 --> 799.98]  How is this part of who God is?
[800.04 --> 801.38]  And so I'm just going to take a few minutes
[801.38 --> 802.76]  and walk us through this,
[802.80 --> 804.34]  because I think this is an important part of Scripture,
[804.84 --> 806.10]  an important part of our understanding
[806.10 --> 807.38]  of who God's character is.
[808.60 --> 809.82]  It's very common today,
[809.94 --> 811.16]  as many of you are probably aware,
[811.66 --> 813.12]  there are outspoken voices who will say,
[813.18 --> 813.48]  You know what?
[813.50 --> 814.94]  How can we take Christianity seriously?
[815.94 --> 816.60]  You read the Bible,
[816.68 --> 817.84]  and it's got this wrathful,
[818.04 --> 818.50]  vengeful,
[818.62 --> 819.50]  retributive God
[819.50 --> 820.68]  who just loves killing people.
[821.26 --> 822.36]  If you ever read Richard Dawkins
[822.36 --> 823.00]  or Sam Harris,
[823.08 --> 823.72]  they're going to give you
[823.72 --> 825.02]  a very strong perspective
[825.02 --> 826.26]  on how foolish it is
[826.26 --> 827.88]  to trust in the Scriptures.
[827.88 --> 829.76]  Christians sometimes
[829.76 --> 831.28]  even look at the Old Testament
[831.28 --> 831.46]  and say,
[831.58 --> 831.70]  Wow,
[831.80 --> 832.50]  I don't know what to do
[832.50 --> 833.44]  with the judgment of God,
[833.58 --> 834.46]  a God who gets angry,
[834.60 --> 835.62]  but we'll just leave
[835.62 --> 836.46]  the Old Testament alone,
[836.80 --> 838.12]  focus just solely on Jesus
[838.12 --> 838.80]  and the Gospels
[838.80 --> 839.98]  and sort of construct our faith
[839.98 --> 840.56]  around that.
[840.80 --> 841.88]  I want to say that's very dangerous,
[842.36 --> 843.32]  because if the Scriptures
[843.32 --> 844.00]  are God's Word,
[844.12 --> 845.46]  all of Scriptures are God's Word.
[846.04 --> 846.78]  If the Old Testament reveals
[846.78 --> 847.28]  God's character,
[847.32 --> 848.22]  we've got to take that seriously.
[849.14 --> 850.40]  And I want to say very clearly,
[851.20 --> 852.24]  God is right
[852.24 --> 854.66]  to be angry with Nineveh.
[855.66 --> 856.84]  God is right
[856.84 --> 858.14]  to be upset
[858.14 --> 859.18]  by a violent,
[859.32 --> 860.12]  oppressive nation,
[860.20 --> 860.74]  don't you think?
[861.86 --> 862.88]  Should God just say,
[862.94 --> 863.38]  You know what?
[863.44 --> 864.60]  Let Nineveh be Nineveh.
[864.94 --> 866.40]  Let Nineveh just run its course.
[866.66 --> 867.58]  Let's see what happens.
[867.72 --> 868.62]  And sort of step back
[868.62 --> 869.62]  with his hands behind his back
[869.62 --> 869.82]  and say,
[869.88 --> 870.54]  I don't even care.
[870.90 --> 872.42]  That's not much of a God to me.
[874.42 --> 874.82]  I want to say,
[874.96 --> 876.24]  there's an author I've read
[876.24 --> 877.20]  a number of years ago now
[877.20 --> 878.12]  who's helped me sort of
[878.12 --> 880.06]  make sense of this dynamic
[880.06 --> 881.12]  between the love of God
[881.12 --> 881.76]  and His judgment.
[882.38 --> 883.98]  And his name is Miroslav Volf.
[884.52 --> 885.20]  He's written a book
[885.20 --> 886.10]  called Free of Charge,
[886.20 --> 887.34]  and I commend that book to you.
[887.78 --> 888.50]  And he himself,
[888.62 --> 889.38]  as an academic,
[889.80 --> 890.96]  wrestled with this idea
[890.96 --> 891.18]  of like,
[891.24 --> 892.22]  how can I believe in a God
[892.22 --> 893.26]  who can judge?
[893.34 --> 894.22]  How can I believe in a God
[894.22 --> 895.38]  who's got this kind of power
[895.38 --> 896.10]  over humanity
[896.10 --> 897.88]  and exercises His judgment
[897.88 --> 898.48]  throughout history?
[899.26 --> 900.02]  And then he sort of
[900.02 --> 900.98]  sorted through his own life
[900.98 --> 901.48]  because he grew up
[901.48 --> 902.18]  in Yugoslavia
[902.18 --> 903.38]  where there was a very
[903.38 --> 904.34]  brutal civil war.
[904.42 --> 905.16]  And I want to read for you
[905.16 --> 906.10]  a bit of an extended quote
[906.10 --> 906.46]  from him
[906.46 --> 907.44]  because I think he says
[907.44 --> 908.74]  so well
[908.74 --> 910.56]  what we can so often
[910.56 --> 911.80]  spread apart.
[911.80 --> 912.34]  So here we go.
[912.46 --> 913.18]  This is a little bit
[913.18 --> 913.76]  of an extended quote
[913.76 --> 914.42]  from Miroslav Volf.
[915.86 --> 917.50]  My last resistance
[917.50 --> 918.84]  to the idea
[918.84 --> 920.00]  of God's wrath
[920.00 --> 921.48]  was a casualty
[921.48 --> 922.08]  of the war
[922.08 --> 923.44]  in former Yugoslavia,
[923.60 --> 924.08]  the region
[924.08 --> 925.14]  from which I came.
[925.98 --> 927.46]  According to some estimates,
[927.64 --> 929.08]  200,000 people
[929.08 --> 929.60]  were killed
[929.60 --> 931.16]  and over 3 million
[931.16 --> 931.72]  were displaced.
[933.10 --> 933.90]  My villages
[933.90 --> 934.60]  and cities
[934.60 --> 935.12]  were destroyed.
[935.28 --> 936.12]  My people shelled
[936.12 --> 937.28]  day in and day out,
[937.44 --> 938.52]  some of them brutalized
[938.52 --> 939.48]  beyond imagination.
[939.48 --> 941.58]  And I could not imagine
[941.58 --> 943.88]  God not being angry.
[944.98 --> 946.32]  Though I used to complain
[946.32 --> 947.44]  about the indecency
[947.44 --> 948.40]  of the idea
[948.40 --> 949.20]  of God's wrath,
[949.36 --> 950.12]  I came to think
[950.12 --> 951.14]  that I would have to rebel
[951.14 --> 952.06]  against a God
[952.06 --> 953.86]  who was not wrathful
[953.86 --> 955.00]  at the sight
[955.00 --> 956.40]  of the world's evil.
[957.04 --> 957.74]  And here's the line
[957.74 --> 958.68]  I can't unhear.
[959.48 --> 960.62]  God isn't wrathful
[960.62 --> 962.02]  in spite of being love.
[962.74 --> 963.60]  God is wrathful
[963.60 --> 965.68]  because God is love.
[967.04 --> 967.52]  Do you hear
[967.52 --> 968.10]  what he's saying there?
[968.10 --> 970.32]  God intervenes
[970.32 --> 971.28]  because he cares.
[971.76 --> 972.96]  His love for his world,
[973.08 --> 974.54]  his love for his image bearers
[974.54 --> 976.66]  stands against oppression
[976.66 --> 977.56]  and violence.
[977.94 --> 978.28]  And God,
[978.44 --> 978.74]  like almost,
[978.84 --> 979.94]  this is not a perfect analogy,
[980.06 --> 980.82]  but almost like a parent
[980.82 --> 981.34]  on the playground
[981.34 --> 982.22]  who sees a child
[982.22 --> 983.30]  pulverizing another,
[983.52 --> 984.32]  he steps in.
[984.92 --> 985.38]  And he says,
[985.66 --> 986.52]  this and no more.
[986.62 --> 987.36]  This is the boundary.
[987.64 --> 988.58]  This is my world.
[989.22 --> 990.58]  You as the Assyrian king
[990.58 --> 991.64]  don't get to brutalize
[991.64 --> 992.50]  the rest of the nations.
[992.80 --> 993.88]  I will step in.
[994.12 --> 995.00]  I'm the judge.
[995.50 --> 996.26]  You are not.
[996.26 --> 998.38]  I want to say
[998.38 --> 999.22]  just a little bit more
[999.22 --> 999.68]  about this.
[999.82 --> 1000.92]  This is sort of a sidebar
[1000.92 --> 1001.84]  Dave Gruen reflection
[1001.84 --> 1003.16]  that I think is worth sharing.
[1004.86 --> 1006.26]  Chris Wright has once said,
[1006.32 --> 1006.70]  and I don't remember
[1006.70 --> 1007.28]  where I read this,
[1007.36 --> 1007.66]  but he says,
[1007.78 --> 1008.16]  humans,
[1008.44 --> 1010.44]  we have to take some time
[1010.44 --> 1011.86]  to question our judgment
[1011.86 --> 1012.82]  of God's judgment.
[1014.00 --> 1014.56]  That is to say,
[1014.64 --> 1015.70]  who are we to say
[1015.70 --> 1017.26]  what God can judge
[1017.26 --> 1018.26]  or how God can judge
[1018.26 --> 1019.46]  and how God can't judge?
[1019.84 --> 1020.78]  And it is one thing,
[1020.82 --> 1021.32]  let me be clear,
[1021.42 --> 1022.02]  it is one thing
[1022.02 --> 1022.92]  to read the Old Testament,
[1023.04 --> 1023.78]  and there are some stories
[1023.78 --> 1024.98]  in there that make you
[1024.98 --> 1025.52]  feel uncomfortable
[1025.52 --> 1026.56]  because there's real judgment.
[1027.88 --> 1028.56]  And I think we should
[1028.56 --> 1029.00]  feel uncomfortable
[1029.00 --> 1029.66]  because I don't think
[1029.66 --> 1030.54]  God delights ever
[1030.54 --> 1031.28]  in judgment.
[1031.70 --> 1032.60]  But it's another thing
[1032.60 --> 1033.58]  to go to the next step,
[1033.66 --> 1034.64]  which many people do
[1034.64 --> 1035.06]  where they say,
[1035.12 --> 1035.54]  oh man,
[1035.62 --> 1037.06]  I just can't trust this Bible,
[1037.22 --> 1038.36]  I can't trust this God,
[1038.64 --> 1039.70]  he's exercising judgment,
[1039.84 --> 1040.84]  surely there's another way.
[1041.54 --> 1042.20]  And I think that's
[1042.20 --> 1043.04]  a very dangerous move
[1043.04 --> 1043.94]  because what you're doing,
[1044.08 --> 1044.66]  let's be clear,
[1045.20 --> 1045.82]  is you are saying,
[1045.90 --> 1046.06]  you know,
[1046.06 --> 1048.22]  me in my very human state
[1048.22 --> 1049.60]  with all my sinful decisions,
[1049.74 --> 1051.56]  all my compromised moral choices,
[1051.56 --> 1053.46]  I can now rise above all that
[1053.46 --> 1054.28]  and beyond that,
[1054.46 --> 1056.18]  I can rise above God
[1056.18 --> 1058.42]  and tell God how to be God.
[1059.48 --> 1060.78]  And I've read enough books
[1060.78 --> 1061.64]  that are critical
[1061.64 --> 1062.42]  of the Old Testament
[1062.42 --> 1063.18]  and God's judgment
[1063.18 --> 1064.16]  to listen to them
[1064.16 --> 1064.88]  and I get frustrated
[1064.88 --> 1065.32]  because like,
[1065.42 --> 1065.82]  oh man,
[1065.86 --> 1066.80]  how can we believe in that God?
[1066.96 --> 1067.96]  What we need is humans
[1067.96 --> 1068.58]  who do this.
[1068.64 --> 1068.96]  And I want to say,
[1069.00 --> 1070.22]  just stop it right there.
[1070.86 --> 1071.40]  Because you know how
[1071.40 --> 1072.54]  Nineveh became Nineveh?
[1072.94 --> 1074.50]  Because humans got to run the show.
[1075.30 --> 1076.06]  So the solution
[1076.06 --> 1077.30]  is not humans just doing
[1077.30 --> 1078.12]  something a little differently,
[1078.22 --> 1078.82]  the solution is
[1078.82 --> 1080.26]  a God who has the power
[1080.26 --> 1081.48]  to stand against oppression.
[1081.56 --> 1083.86]  And God who says,
[1084.12 --> 1084.90]  this and no more,
[1085.34 --> 1086.02]  king of Assyria,
[1086.50 --> 1087.40]  you are immortal,
[1087.92 --> 1089.00]  your choices are foolish,
[1089.38 --> 1090.38]  you're making a mess
[1090.38 --> 1091.08]  of my creation
[1091.08 --> 1093.16]  and I hold you to account.
[1094.54 --> 1095.98]  God is not wrathful
[1095.98 --> 1097.64]  in spite of his love.
[1098.16 --> 1098.86]  He is wrathful
[1098.86 --> 1100.10]  because he is love.
[1100.84 --> 1101.94]  And he is the only one
[1101.94 --> 1102.56]  with the power
[1102.56 --> 1103.62]  to stand against
[1103.62 --> 1105.02]  the most oppressive forces.
[1105.18 --> 1105.68]  And by the way,
[1105.74 --> 1106.78]  the hope of the church
[1106.78 --> 1108.42]  for the whole of creation
[1108.42 --> 1109.94]  is that when God in Christ
[1109.94 --> 1110.90]  returns in glory
[1110.90 --> 1111.84]  and judgment at the end,
[1112.20 --> 1112.86]  that oppression
[1112.86 --> 1114.12]  will be pushed away
[1114.12 --> 1115.14]  from God's good creation.
[1115.84 --> 1116.88]  He will once and for all
[1116.88 --> 1118.88]  eradicate his good creation
[1118.88 --> 1120.78]  of all that stands against
[1120.78 --> 1121.28]  his goodness,
[1121.50 --> 1121.78]  justice,
[1121.90 --> 1122.24]  and love.
[1122.92 --> 1123.62]  That's our hope.
[1125.18 --> 1126.54]  But let's then return to Jonah.
[1126.60 --> 1127.24]  That was all a bit of
[1127.24 --> 1128.36]  a significant sidebar,
[1128.46 --> 1128.98]  you might say,
[1129.12 --> 1129.76]  but important.
[1129.96 --> 1130.94]  And I know there's many of us
[1130.94 --> 1131.62]  who wrestle with this
[1131.62 --> 1132.20]  and we wrestle with how
[1132.20 --> 1132.72]  to read the scripture,
[1132.84 --> 1133.68]  so I gave us some time.
[1134.36 --> 1135.42]  But let's go back to Jonah.
[1136.14 --> 1137.80]  It starts with the wickedness
[1137.80 --> 1138.60]  of this city
[1138.60 --> 1140.04]  coming to God's attention.
[1140.30 --> 1140.96]  And what does he do?
[1141.76 --> 1143.38]  He doesn't just destroy the city.
[1143.98 --> 1145.04]  He calls this really
[1145.04 --> 1145.92]  rebellious prophet.
[1146.02 --> 1146.24]  He says,
[1146.52 --> 1147.64]  Jonah, go to Nineveh
[1147.64 --> 1148.92]  and tell them the word
[1148.92 --> 1149.96]  that I want you to speak to them.
[1149.98 --> 1150.74]  And Jonah runs away.
[1150.96 --> 1152.10]  And God is concerned such that
[1152.10 --> 1152.32]  he's like,
[1152.38 --> 1152.86]  all right, Jonah,
[1153.00 --> 1154.20]  I'll take you from this whale
[1154.20 --> 1155.16]  and I'm going to send you
[1155.16 --> 1156.02]  into the city again.
[1156.54 --> 1157.50]  Jonah might give the most
[1157.50 --> 1159.70]  reduced version of God's judgment
[1159.70 --> 1160.40]  and still,
[1161.48 --> 1162.34]  God warns them
[1162.34 --> 1163.60]  and he gives them 40 days.
[1163.82 --> 1164.90]  He doesn't have to do that.
[1165.82 --> 1166.74]  And after the 40 days,
[1166.80 --> 1167.62]  he's still just
[1167.62 --> 1168.48]  if he wants to judge it,
[1168.52 --> 1168.88]  but he says,
[1168.96 --> 1170.68]  no, they have repented.
[1171.68 --> 1172.36]  And know this,
[1172.38 --> 1173.28]  this is a really important detail
[1173.28 --> 1173.98]  about God's judgment.
[1174.44 --> 1175.92]  It is announced and pronounced
[1175.92 --> 1177.22]  and made clear to the city
[1177.22 --> 1179.04]  so that they can repent.
[1179.98 --> 1181.76]  God's desire is for every city
[1181.76 --> 1183.22]  to know how wicked they are
[1183.22 --> 1184.66]  and turn towards him
[1184.66 --> 1185.98]  in repentance and faith
[1185.98 --> 1187.12]  so that they can receive
[1187.12 --> 1188.02]  his mercy and grace.
[1188.66 --> 1189.74]  That's the story of Nineveh.
[1190.12 --> 1191.38]  They get 40 days to repent
[1191.38 --> 1192.96]  because God does not desire
[1192.96 --> 1194.44]  to wipe out the city.
[1194.44 --> 1195.50]  He desires for the city
[1195.50 --> 1197.06]  to repent, right?
[1197.40 --> 1198.46]  And how does it finish
[1198.46 --> 1199.98]  with Nineveh doing
[1199.98 --> 1200.94]  that very thing?
[1201.86 --> 1202.48]  Ninevites seeing
[1202.48 --> 1203.22]  their wicked ways,
[1203.52 --> 1204.68]  the king becoming aware
[1204.68 --> 1205.42]  of his violence
[1205.42 --> 1206.36]  that for so many years
[1206.36 --> 1207.26]  he has celebrated.
[1207.50 --> 1208.16]  They're in the dust,
[1208.26 --> 1208.92]  they're in the ashes,
[1209.18 --> 1210.22]  they're in a posture of humility
[1210.22 --> 1210.70]  and God says,
[1210.84 --> 1211.94]  I will not destroy you
[1211.94 --> 1213.48]  because that is not my desire
[1213.48 --> 1214.08]  for my world
[1214.08 --> 1214.96]  or for my cities,
[1215.06 --> 1215.92]  even the wicked cities
[1215.92 --> 1216.50]  of Nineveh.
[1216.70 --> 1218.34]  They get compassion.
[1218.34 --> 1221.20]  We're going to look at this
[1221.20 --> 1221.96]  again next week
[1221.96 --> 1224.86]  but the passage
[1224.86 --> 1226.58]  that Jonah has to wrestle with,
[1226.68 --> 1227.92]  the reality that Jonah
[1227.92 --> 1228.74]  has to wrestle with
[1228.74 --> 1229.60]  is what the psalmists
[1229.60 --> 1231.60]  exalt God for over and over again
[1231.60 --> 1232.24]  where they say,
[1232.76 --> 1234.26]  he is gracious and compassionate.
[1235.30 --> 1237.68]  He is slow to anger
[1237.68 --> 1240.16]  and abounding in love
[1240.16 --> 1242.32]  and he does not treat us
[1242.32 --> 1243.86]  as our sins deserve,
[1244.70 --> 1246.92]  even the Ninevites.
[1247.70 --> 1248.58]  And Jonah's going to have
[1248.58 --> 1249.54]  to wrestle with himself,
[1249.66 --> 1250.32]  he's going to have to wrestle
[1250.32 --> 1251.06]  with his own desire
[1251.06 --> 1252.04]  for sweet revenge
[1252.04 --> 1253.04]  because he's witnessing
[1253.04 --> 1254.54]  the profundity
[1254.54 --> 1256.18]  of God's compassion
[1256.18 --> 1257.66]  towards a wicked city
[1257.66 --> 1258.74]  that turned from their ways
[1258.74 --> 1260.20]  and found the riches
[1260.20 --> 1261.72]  of God's grace.
[1263.28 --> 1264.80]  Now when I first was working
[1264.80 --> 1265.78]  on this sermon this week,
[1266.14 --> 1267.02]  I had a plan
[1267.02 --> 1268.28]  for focusing the end of my sermon.
[1268.40 --> 1269.28]  I was going to ask the question,
[1269.34 --> 1269.88]  I'll ask it.
[1270.90 --> 1271.68]  The question is,
[1271.82 --> 1273.48]  as you hear this story of Jonah,
[1274.36 --> 1275.72]  who is Nineveh for you
[1275.72 --> 1277.58]  or where is Nineveh for you?
[1277.82 --> 1278.18]  Nineveh.
[1279.44 --> 1280.68]  Who or where are the places
[1280.68 --> 1281.76]  where you will not go near,
[1282.22 --> 1283.14]  where you want to see
[1283.14 --> 1284.08]  that sweet justice,
[1284.38 --> 1285.16]  that revenge,
[1285.44 --> 1286.36]  and you are not willing
[1286.36 --> 1287.74]  to understand the possibility
[1287.74 --> 1289.38]  of repentance and mercy?
[1290.12 --> 1290.84]  It's an important question.
[1290.92 --> 1291.86]  Bring that to your small groups.
[1292.68 --> 1293.70]  But I actually want to tell you
[1293.70 --> 1294.36]  where I've been wrestling
[1294.36 --> 1295.22]  with this passage
[1295.22 --> 1296.38]  because I've realized
[1296.38 --> 1297.16]  in my own study
[1297.16 --> 1298.10]  that we are not
[1298.10 --> 1298.82]  in the same place
[1298.82 --> 1299.88]  of Israel and Assyria.
[1300.00 --> 1300.72]  Israel was a sort of
[1300.72 --> 1302.16]  a religious nation
[1302.16 --> 1303.58]  and Assyria was this other nation
[1303.58 --> 1305.50]  we are very much more
[1305.50 --> 1306.78]  like Daniel
[1306.78 --> 1308.52]  where you've got
[1308.52 --> 1309.26]  a group of believers
[1309.26 --> 1310.68]  living in this
[1310.68 --> 1311.52]  very different city,
[1311.60 --> 1312.60]  this very pagan city
[1312.60 --> 1313.02]  that's shaped
[1313.02 --> 1313.98]  in a very different way.
[1314.44 --> 1315.30]  And I think we've got
[1315.30 --> 1315.90]  something to learn
[1315.90 --> 1316.74]  from the Ninevites.
[1318.12 --> 1319.30]  That is to say this,
[1319.42 --> 1320.00]  you and I
[1320.00 --> 1321.82]  as a small group of believers
[1321.82 --> 1323.18]  in a very secular city,
[1323.28 --> 1323.98]  I hope you know that,
[1324.04 --> 1325.38]  we live in a very secular city
[1325.38 --> 1326.52]  and the laws of our land,
[1327.20 --> 1328.42]  the decisions of our government,
[1328.42 --> 1329.86]  the social patterns
[1329.86 --> 1330.98]  of our area
[1330.98 --> 1332.32]  are not in line
[1332.32 --> 1333.24]  with God's design
[1333.24 --> 1333.76]  for the world.
[1334.14 --> 1334.56]  They aren't.
[1335.20 --> 1336.18]  So many decisions,
[1336.38 --> 1337.32]  so many policies
[1337.32 --> 1338.08]  that get enacted
[1338.08 --> 1339.58]  are not from the scriptures.
[1340.44 --> 1341.48]  And what often happens
[1341.48 --> 1341.92]  as Christians,
[1342.06 --> 1343.10]  we grow up in this culture,
[1343.48 --> 1344.80]  we have this secular mindset
[1344.80 --> 1345.96]  that is just built
[1345.96 --> 1346.68]  into our bones,
[1346.74 --> 1347.16]  you might say,
[1347.20 --> 1347.64]  through curriculum
[1347.64 --> 1348.28]  in our schools,
[1348.56 --> 1349.44]  through the media we watch,
[1349.50 --> 1350.30]  through all the relationships
[1350.30 --> 1350.74]  we have,
[1350.88 --> 1352.06]  and we have a Western way
[1352.06 --> 1352.40]  of thinking
[1352.40 --> 1353.42]  that is actually far
[1353.42 --> 1354.86]  from what God teaches
[1354.86 --> 1355.44]  in His word.
[1355.94 --> 1357.16]  And our moral decisions,
[1357.36 --> 1358.28]  the way we view the world
[1358.28 --> 1359.06]  and what is right and wrong
[1359.06 --> 1360.14]  is so skewed
[1360.14 --> 1361.08]  by the culture
[1361.08 --> 1362.08]  in which we grow up in.
[1362.48 --> 1363.52]  And I think the word
[1363.52 --> 1364.54]  that is for the church
[1364.54 --> 1366.74]  is get off the throne.
[1367.98 --> 1368.90]  Get off the throne.
[1369.98 --> 1370.88]  If there's one thing
[1370.88 --> 1371.88]  that makes me really
[1371.88 --> 1372.98]  pay attention to our culture,
[1373.08 --> 1373.48]  it is that
[1373.48 --> 1374.72]  one of the most
[1374.72 --> 1375.60]  dominant messages
[1375.60 --> 1376.40]  that we receive
[1376.40 --> 1377.36]  in hundreds of ways
[1377.36 --> 1379.12]  is you're in control.
[1380.42 --> 1381.18]  Don't let your friends
[1381.18 --> 1381.76]  tell you what to do.
[1381.88 --> 1382.42]  Don't let your parents
[1382.42 --> 1383.00]  tell you what to do.
[1383.20 --> 1383.74]  Don't let your kids
[1383.74 --> 1384.28]  tell you what to do.
[1384.54 --> 1385.52]  You get to decide
[1385.52 --> 1386.54]  what you get to do.
[1387.16 --> 1388.42]  No one else is in control.
[1388.84 --> 1389.46]  You get to be
[1389.46 --> 1390.36]  however you want to be.
[1390.48 --> 1391.12]  You do you.
[1391.46 --> 1392.06]  No one else
[1392.06 --> 1392.86]  has any authority
[1392.86 --> 1393.38]  in your life.
[1393.64 --> 1394.80]  And Jonah 3 says to us,
[1395.04 --> 1395.94]  get off the throne.
[1396.90 --> 1397.78]  You do not know
[1397.78 --> 1398.62]  how to rule your life.
[1398.92 --> 1400.22]  You are so compromised
[1400.22 --> 1401.42]  in your decision making,
[1401.72 --> 1402.42]  so twisted
[1402.42 --> 1403.16]  in what you think
[1403.16 --> 1403.76]  is right and wrong,
[1403.98 --> 1405.38]  you must submit yourself
[1405.38 --> 1407.60]  to someone who does know
[1407.60 --> 1409.08]  and that is a living God.
[1409.82 --> 1410.90]  I really do think
[1410.90 --> 1412.14]  that we have so much
[1412.14 --> 1412.90]  to learn from the king
[1412.90 --> 1413.32]  of Assyria
[1413.32 --> 1414.22]  who has the humility
[1414.22 --> 1414.48]  to say,
[1414.54 --> 1414.98]  you know what?
[1415.08 --> 1416.10]  I've caught this wrong.
[1416.10 --> 1417.88]  Our city has got this wrong.
[1417.94 --> 1419.22]  Our violence is wrong.
[1419.56 --> 1420.48]  We need to know
[1420.48 --> 1421.78]  from someone else
[1421.78 --> 1422.40]  how to live.
[1422.68 --> 1423.26]  And I tell you what,
[1423.32 --> 1423.76]  for the church
[1423.76 --> 1424.68]  that requires saying,
[1425.04 --> 1425.90]  I might have grown up
[1425.90 --> 1426.44]  with assumptions,
[1426.78 --> 1428.00]  but I'm ready to listen
[1428.00 --> 1429.08]  to God speak to me
[1429.08 --> 1429.94]  by his word
[1429.94 --> 1430.74]  to determine
[1430.74 --> 1431.56]  how I am to live.
[1432.84 --> 1433.84]  I really do think
[1433.84 --> 1434.64]  for Christians today
[1434.64 --> 1435.76]  to really believe
[1435.76 --> 1436.30]  what I'm preaching
[1436.30 --> 1436.84]  on right now
[1436.84 --> 1437.28]  is saying,
[1437.78 --> 1438.66]  I might have it wrong
[1438.66 --> 1439.44]  and I'm willing
[1439.44 --> 1440.62]  to be humble enough
[1440.62 --> 1441.88]  to listen.
[1443.20 --> 1444.94]  Get off the throne.
[1444.94 --> 1451.86]  I think of Jesus' ministry
[1451.86 --> 1453.04]  in the Gospel of Mark.
[1453.98 --> 1454.80]  He starts,
[1455.24 --> 1456.44]  his opening statement
[1456.44 --> 1457.66]  in Mark's Gospel
[1457.66 --> 1458.72]  is,
[1459.06 --> 1459.58]  good news,
[1460.20 --> 1461.20]  the kingdom of God
[1461.20 --> 1461.72]  is near.
[1461.82 --> 1462.58]  What does he say next?
[1463.64 --> 1464.16]  Repent
[1464.16 --> 1466.24]  and believe.
[1467.00 --> 1468.02]  Right off the hop,
[1468.16 --> 1469.04]  Jesus wants people to know,
[1469.28 --> 1469.80]  you probably have
[1469.80 --> 1470.58]  all sorts of assumptions
[1470.58 --> 1471.40]  about what God is like.
[1471.46 --> 1472.24]  You have all sorts of assumptions
[1472.24 --> 1472.72]  about how you live.
[1472.92 --> 1473.34]  Guess what?
[1473.34 --> 1474.34]  Now it's time to repent.
[1474.66 --> 1475.66]  Turn and follow the way
[1475.66 --> 1476.42]  I'm going to show you.
[1477.22 --> 1478.34]  Nine chapters later,
[1478.48 --> 1479.22]  Jesus is teaching
[1479.22 --> 1480.04]  this now assembled
[1480.04 --> 1480.86]  group of disciples
[1480.86 --> 1481.54]  and he says to them,
[1481.76 --> 1482.66]  if you want to be
[1482.66 --> 1483.36]  my disciple,
[1483.86 --> 1484.74]  if you want to be part
[1484.74 --> 1485.54]  of the kingdom way
[1485.54 --> 1485.96]  of Jesus,
[1486.24 --> 1486.94]  you must what?
[1488.16 --> 1488.96]  Deny yourself.
[1489.94 --> 1490.50]  That is like
[1490.50 --> 1491.14]  the worst thing
[1491.14 --> 1492.08]  to tell a Western person.
[1492.26 --> 1492.94]  Deny yourself.
[1493.60 --> 1494.56]  Take up your cross
[1494.56 --> 1496.82]  and follow me.
[1497.66 --> 1498.10]  And then he says
[1498.10 --> 1498.58]  something else
[1498.58 --> 1499.04]  that's challenging
[1499.04 --> 1500.18]  to Westerners
[1500.18 --> 1500.84]  who love control.
[1501.08 --> 1501.74]  For whoever wants
[1501.74 --> 1502.58]  to save their life
[1502.58 --> 1503.10]  will what?
[1503.62 --> 1504.12]  Lose it.
[1504.62 --> 1505.14]  And whoever wants
[1505.14 --> 1505.98]  to lose their life
[1505.98 --> 1506.66]  for my sake,
[1506.78 --> 1507.48]  Jesus' sake,
[1507.78 --> 1508.76]  will gain it
[1508.76 --> 1510.14]  both now and forever.
[1510.96 --> 1512.04]  Get off the throne
[1512.04 --> 1512.78]  and that comes
[1512.78 --> 1513.26]  from Jesus.
[1514.36 --> 1515.28]  And Jesus knows
[1515.28 --> 1516.34]  what we so often
[1516.34 --> 1517.10]  don't believe
[1517.10 --> 1518.06]  in our day-to-day life
[1518.06 --> 1518.52]  and that is
[1518.52 --> 1520.20]  his way is life.
[1520.88 --> 1522.02]  When we sit on the throne
[1522.02 --> 1522.92]  and we're making decisions,
[1523.04 --> 1523.70]  we're trying to decide
[1523.70 --> 1524.06]  for ourselves
[1524.06 --> 1524.56]  what's right and wrong,
[1524.70 --> 1526.26]  we will wreck our lives.
[1526.86 --> 1528.00]  We will wreck the lives
[1528.00 --> 1528.84]  of those around us.
[1528.88 --> 1529.82]  And as I've said before,
[1530.16 --> 1531.06]  Nineveh is living
[1531.06 --> 1532.22]  proof of the mess
[1532.22 --> 1532.96]  that happens
[1532.96 --> 1533.54]  when humans
[1533.54 --> 1534.66]  get the throne.
[1535.70 --> 1536.70]  And I would also add,
[1536.96 --> 1538.24]  so much of our city
[1538.24 --> 1539.10]  and our legislation
[1539.10 --> 1539.86]  and our governments
[1539.86 --> 1540.58]  are evidence
[1540.58 --> 1541.22]  of what happens
[1541.22 --> 1542.26]  when humans are in control
[1542.26 --> 1543.84]  and it's a mess.
[1544.92 --> 1545.94]  We need to get off
[1545.94 --> 1546.38]  the throne
[1546.38 --> 1547.76]  and trust that the way
[1547.76 --> 1548.16]  of Jesus
[1548.16 --> 1549.22]  is the way
[1549.22 --> 1550.64]  of flourishing.
[1552.92 --> 1553.74]  I'm going to pick up
[1553.74 --> 1554.64]  on this in just a minute
[1554.64 --> 1555.38]  when we do communion,
[1555.50 --> 1555.96]  but I invite you
[1555.96 --> 1556.88]  to join me in prayer.
[1561.78 --> 1562.68]  Father, we thank you
[1562.68 --> 1563.30]  for your word.
[1564.76 --> 1565.44]  We thank you
[1565.44 --> 1566.60]  that you sit on the throne.
[1567.68 --> 1568.90]  You rule creation
[1568.90 --> 1570.54]  and we do not.
[1571.90 --> 1573.00]  We pray that if there
[1573.00 --> 1574.20]  are places and people
[1574.20 --> 1576.16]  we want to see
[1576.16 --> 1577.14]  experience revenge
[1577.14 --> 1577.90]  rather than mercy,
[1578.00 --> 1578.56]  that you'd reveal
[1578.56 --> 1579.30]  that to us.
[1580.26 --> 1581.02]  And we pray
[1581.02 --> 1581.88]  for the areas
[1581.88 --> 1582.40]  where we want
[1582.40 --> 1583.28]  to stay on the throne.
[1584.68 --> 1585.20]  There are areas
[1585.20 --> 1585.66]  where we want
[1585.66 --> 1586.52]  to hold control
[1586.52 --> 1587.58]  that you by your spirit
[1587.58 --> 1588.52]  would soften our hearts
[1588.52 --> 1589.02]  and bring us
[1589.02 --> 1589.58]  to repentance
[1589.58 --> 1591.26]  and humility.
[1592.76 --> 1593.82]  We want to live
[1593.82 --> 1594.66]  by your word.
[1595.56 --> 1596.66]  We want to trust
[1596.66 --> 1597.30]  your way
[1597.30 --> 1598.22]  for our lives.
[1598.74 --> 1599.36]  And we ask
[1599.36 --> 1599.92]  that your spirit
[1599.92 --> 1600.46]  would make us
[1600.46 --> 1601.18]  the kind of people
[1601.18 --> 1603.30]  that submit to you
[1603.30 --> 1604.04]  in the whole
[1604.04 --> 1604.78]  of our lives.
[1605.62 --> 1606.32]  We pray this
[1606.32 --> 1607.02]  in Christ's name.
[1607.20 --> 1607.40]  Amen.
[1607.40 --> 1610.00]  I invite you
[1610.00 --> 1610.42]  to stand
[1610.42 --> 1611.04]  and sing with me
[1611.04 --> 1612.00]  a song of response.
[1612.06 --> 1612.38]  We're going to sing
[1612.38 --> 1613.20]  the first verse
[1613.20 --> 1613.90]  while our children
[1613.90 --> 1614.40]  join us
[1614.40 --> 1614.76]  and then we're
[1614.76 --> 1615.16]  going to celebrate
[1615.16 --> 1616.02]  communion together.
[1616.02 --> 1617.26]  you know the next
[1617.26 --> 1621.22]  next day
[1621.56 --> 1621.82]  and I'll see you
[1621.82 --> 1623.12]  in this
[1623.12 --> 1624.46]  you
[1624.46 --> 1624.66]  can
[1624.66 --> 1624.68]  come
[1624.74 --> 1625.40]  in this
[1625.40 --> 1627.06]  half
[1627.06 --> 1628.10]  of the
[1628.10 --> 1629.02]  joy and
[1629.38 --> 1631.88]  the
[1631.88 --> 1632.88]  hour
[1632.88 --> 1633.52]  and
[1633.52 --> 1634.34]  the
[1634.34 --> 1634.98]  see you
