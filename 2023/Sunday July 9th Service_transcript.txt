[0.00 --> 2.44]  Good morning.
[4.72 --> 11.22]  Just a reminder that you do have an opportunity to give to the offering.
[12.08 --> 16.60]  We don't pass the basket around, but there's an opportunity to give with our church app.
[16.74 --> 19.22]  There's also a debit machine in the back.
[20.12 --> 25.60]  We encourage you to give so that the work of God may carry on.
[25.60 --> 25.68]  Amen.
[27.90 --> 36.36]  We are blessed as a people to gather together, and I'm always very conscious of that when we gather because I need it.
[36.52 --> 37.38]  I hope you do too.
[38.46 --> 41.38]  But we are a people who gather around God's Word together.
[43.04 --> 44.56]  God's Word is our source of truth.
[46.04 --> 53.02]  So we're going to continue looking into God's Word this morning in our series on the Beatitudes and the Blessed Ours.
[53.02 --> 58.72]  And so I'm going to read how far we've come so far in this passage.
[58.86 --> 59.70]  Matthew 5.
[60.34 --> 61.24]  Look at it with me.
[62.88 --> 69.02]  Now when Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on a mountainside and sat down,
[70.00 --> 74.74]  and His disciples, His followers, came to Him, and He began to teach them.
[75.90 --> 81.58]  Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[83.02 --> 87.56]  Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[88.54 --> 92.22]  Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
[93.34 --> 98.52]  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
[99.40 --> 100.56]  And then today's passage.
[101.26 --> 104.64]  Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
[104.64 --> 107.68]  That's the fifth beatitude.
[107.84 --> 110.16]  Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.
[110.96 --> 116.52]  And you might be thinking, well, of course, of course, that this makes sense.
[117.46 --> 119.00]  You know, blessed are the poor in spirit.
[120.04 --> 121.60]  Blessed are those who mourn.
[121.70 --> 122.24]  I don't know.
[122.36 --> 123.50]  Blessed are the meek.
[123.94 --> 124.16]  Right?
[124.28 --> 124.62]  Really?
[125.12 --> 126.38]  You know, we talked about those things.
[126.60 --> 128.70]  But this one seems pretty straightforward.
[129.46 --> 131.10]  Blessed are the merciful, that receive mercy.
[131.10 --> 133.06]  You know, we kind of get it.
[134.18 --> 139.64]  But then we begin to dig into what Jesus means about the nature of mercy.
[140.80 --> 147.72]  It's so easy to take a word like mercy in a Christian context and figure we've got that one figured out.
[147.82 --> 151.02]  And I want to probably assure you, we don't.
[151.94 --> 152.44]  We don't.
[152.44 --> 163.82]  It's so easy to keep a word religiously vague because then it doesn't have to penetrate your very humanity, your very lives.
[164.86 --> 168.48]  So let's explore what Jesus means by the word mercy.
[168.88 --> 175.90]  And I decided to find another passage where Jesus talks about mercy, kind of doing another case study out of the life of Jesus here.
[176.18 --> 178.92]  And I picked Matthew 9, the verses 9 through 17.
[178.92 --> 181.02]  So let's look at that for a moment as well.
[182.96 --> 189.96]  As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth.
[191.02 --> 199.04]  Now right away, you should be struck by the word tax collector and know that this is not a well-liked individual in this culture.
[200.18 --> 202.42]  Follow me, he told him.
[202.54 --> 204.56]  And Matthew got up and followed him.
[204.56 --> 212.48]  While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.
[213.30 --> 215.68]  And when the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples,
[216.10 --> 219.68]  Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?
[221.14 --> 222.76]  On hearing this, Jesus said,
[223.12 --> 225.68]  It's not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
[226.64 --> 228.88]  But go and learn what this means.
[228.88 --> 231.40]  I desire mercy, not sacrifice.
[231.78 --> 235.82]  For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.
[238.76 --> 241.72]  That line, I desire mercy, not sacrifice.
[241.80 --> 242.80]  We're going to look at that a little bit.
[243.14 --> 248.36]  Jesus always calls people away from something to something else.
[248.36 --> 251.90]  Away from what I'm going to call religion.
[252.46 --> 259.04]  This sort of practice that we might engage in as just another practice in our lives.
[259.40 --> 262.28]  But it's something you control.
[263.52 --> 264.54]  It leaves it in your hands.
[265.26 --> 269.26]  And so then, you know, you just have to be a little bit better here and there.
[269.48 --> 273.72]  A little bit more merciful, a little nicer here, a little more patient.
[274.04 --> 274.62]  There we go.
[274.70 --> 275.72]  We're on the right track.
[275.72 --> 277.94]  And the Beatitudes are not saying that.
[278.14 --> 280.98]  They're saying, you need to take on the character of Christ.
[281.28 --> 282.22]  Become like Him.
[282.50 --> 284.12]  And He's in control.
[285.24 --> 285.98]  He's in control.
[286.34 --> 289.92]  And we start knowing then that we're poor in spirit.
[290.30 --> 292.40]  It's not in us.
[292.62 --> 295.24]  It's not about self-improvement.
[296.32 --> 300.80]  And then we hunger and thirst because we know, again, it's not in me.
[302.18 --> 303.22]  It's not in me.
[303.22 --> 305.32]  I need something outside of myself.
[305.32 --> 307.14]  Not just more self-improvement.
[307.48 --> 310.96]  This is so much more than adding a few religious upgrades.
[311.28 --> 314.66]  This is all about you being called away from yourself.
[315.24 --> 317.08]  Dying to self, as Scripture says.
[318.36 --> 324.32]  Because religion is often a way of justifying yourself with all your good works.
[324.32 --> 328.04]  Like the Pharisees looking down at the sinners in this story.
[329.10 --> 334.70]  Earlier in Matthew 5, Jesus says, you need righteousness greater than the Pharisees.
[334.82 --> 336.44]  Greater than that self-improvement stuff.
[336.70 --> 338.10]  Greater than you in control.
[338.36 --> 340.00]  Because that's not going to work.
[341.40 --> 343.50]  And there's Jesus eating with sinners.
[343.50 --> 347.80]  That wasn't a wise religious move.
[348.46 --> 350.40]  And so they ask, why is he doing that?
[351.46 --> 353.66]  And Jesus says, because he overhears here.
[354.22 --> 355.32]  Apparently, Jesus has good hearing.
[356.00 --> 359.10]  And Jesus says, the healthy don't need a doctor.
[359.36 --> 360.50]  Only the sick.
[362.58 --> 362.74]  Hmm.
[362.74 --> 365.22]  And I was thinking of Romans 3.
[365.56 --> 367.48]  Paul puts it pretty blunt in this passage.
[367.88 --> 368.46]  Romans 3.
[369.18 --> 371.16]  None is righteous.
[371.92 --> 373.76]  No, not one.
[375.10 --> 377.14]  No one understands.
[378.14 --> 380.06]  No one seeks for God.
[380.44 --> 381.82]  All have turned aside.
[382.16 --> 383.52]  Together they have become worthless.
[383.82 --> 385.10]  So no one does good.
[385.40 --> 387.18]  Not even one.
[387.18 --> 390.36]  Paul's pretty blunt.
[391.46 --> 392.86]  So everyone's sick.
[395.24 --> 396.54]  Everyone needs a doctor.
[398.34 --> 399.58]  Everyone's poor in spirit.
[401.40 --> 406.94]  And Jesus is saying, you know, I have nothing to say to those who don't know their poverty of spirit.
[408.12 --> 415.56]  Only when our old containers, we go in this passage, Jesus talked about we need new wineskins.
[415.56 --> 419.68]  Only when those old containers are smashed can you wine be contained.
[420.00 --> 420.96]  That's just how it goes.
[421.32 --> 425.98]  Religion tends to divide people into good people and bad people.
[426.26 --> 427.28]  I eat with them.
[427.44 --> 428.84]  I don't eat with them.
[429.80 --> 431.08]  Good people, bad people.
[432.38 --> 434.40]  People like Matthew, the tax collector.
[434.74 --> 434.98]  You're right.
[435.08 --> 435.46]  No way.
[435.56 --> 436.06]  Don't eat with them.
[436.34 --> 437.40]  He's working for Rome.
[437.50 --> 438.58]  He accepts bribes.
[439.14 --> 442.74]  In religion, there's big sins and then there's little sins.
[442.74 --> 445.72]  I'm a pretty good person with a few little sins.
[446.32 --> 449.18]  Bad people are those people who commit big sins.
[449.28 --> 450.04]  Kind of like Matthew.
[450.14 --> 450.98]  Accepts bribes.
[451.16 --> 451.94]  Isn't on our side.
[452.22 --> 453.84]  Or sins of a sexual nature.
[454.14 --> 455.68]  Like those of the prostitute.
[455.90 --> 457.54]  Those are big sins, right?
[458.94 --> 460.12]  Religious people.
[462.12 --> 467.60]  Made me think of, this will date me a bit, but Saturday Night Live, church lady.
[468.32 --> 469.62]  Anyone remember church lady?
[469.62 --> 470.02]  Right?
[470.16 --> 475.50]  You know, and looking at somebody who's a bad person and they do something bad and she
[475.50 --> 477.78]  would say, isn't that special?
[479.28 --> 480.96]  Maybe it's Satan?
[481.52 --> 481.78]  Right?
[481.84 --> 482.96]  And she had this line then.
[483.16 --> 486.24]  And basically saying, I'm just glad I'm not like that.
[487.34 --> 489.08]  I'm glad I'm not like that.
[489.08 --> 495.74]  And I don't care if you're liberal or conservative or whatever.
[496.04 --> 498.56]  We all tend to divide the world up.
[499.60 --> 503.90]  Both are religious in their, all these positions are religious in their own way.
[504.18 --> 505.64]  Both justify themselves.
[506.00 --> 506.86]  I'm a good guy.
[506.92 --> 507.56]  Look at my life.
[507.64 --> 508.10]  Look at my thoughts.
[508.38 --> 510.76]  Look at how I sacrifice for what I believe in.
[510.76 --> 515.56]  And therefore, God owes me and he's on my side.
[517.72 --> 519.42]  I've done this and this.
[519.58 --> 520.90]  I have superior values.
[521.14 --> 521.92]  I go to church.
[522.12 --> 522.74]  I fast.
[522.90 --> 523.60]  I protest.
[523.74 --> 524.18]  I whatever.
[524.48 --> 525.46]  So God owes me.
[525.68 --> 527.98]  He needs to bless me with a good life.
[528.24 --> 529.00]  That's his role.
[529.34 --> 530.32]  And that's religion.
[533.00 --> 535.40]  I'm better than those people.
[536.18 --> 538.22]  So God's on my side and against them.
[539.18 --> 542.46]  And everyone's religious in some ways in that negative sense.
[543.48 --> 544.14]  Even atheist.
[545.66 --> 550.42]  Then you look at the world and you say, well, hey, that's unfair over there.
[550.54 --> 551.46]  And it makes me mad.
[551.54 --> 552.64]  And you could ask, well, why?
[552.90 --> 553.16]  Why?
[553.70 --> 554.60]  There's no God.
[554.78 --> 555.54]  Why be mad?
[555.84 --> 556.78]  What's fair?
[558.00 --> 559.32]  What's it got to do with anything?
[560.82 --> 562.78]  Everything's just an accident with no real point.
[562.78 --> 566.34]  You somehow they're saying, I deserve better.
[566.60 --> 569.00]  And that implies some force at work.
[571.12 --> 576.86]  If you divide people into good and bad and you're good, then your sacrifices, your deeds,
[577.10 --> 578.62]  they ought to be rewarded.
[579.14 --> 579.80]  This is true.
[579.96 --> 581.50]  Conservatives, liberals, and everyone else.
[581.78 --> 587.08]  You defend yourself against how you think life ought to go by your good works, your good
[587.08 --> 591.02]  thinking, by your sense of being superior to other people, based on your thoughts and
[591.02 --> 591.48]  opinions.
[592.78 --> 596.30]  And then you say, oh, whoa, whoa, no, no, no, wait a minute.
[596.40 --> 596.94]  Wait a minute, Sid.
[597.02 --> 598.20]  You know, I'm open-minded.
[598.30 --> 600.54]  I just can't stand all those close-minded people.
[603.88 --> 606.58]  The Pharisees brought their sacrifices.
[606.80 --> 607.82]  They brought their tithes.
[607.86 --> 610.88]  They brought their obedience to rules, many of them not even in the Bible.
[610.88 --> 614.08]  And they looked down on anyone not as pure as themselves.
[614.56 --> 616.72]  And therefore, God was on their side.
[616.84 --> 618.06]  Therefore, God owed them.
[618.48 --> 623.04]  And Jesus says, I have nothing to say to people who live like that, who don't even know they
[623.04 --> 624.14]  need a doctor.
[624.14 --> 635.34]  I have nothing to say to you unless you see yourself standing together, all of us together, in the same place
[635.34 --> 639.28]  before God, deeply in need of grace and mercy.
[639.84 --> 641.48]  Same as the adulterer.
[641.86 --> 643.40]  Same as the tax collector.
[643.78 --> 645.22]  Same as the murderer.
[645.22 --> 646.22]  Same as the murderer.
[647.84 --> 649.88]  Those people sitting at the table with Jesus.
[652.16 --> 653.14]  Can you believe that?
[655.50 --> 661.50]  We all need to get rid of our systems of evaluation that make you the center of it all.
[661.50 --> 670.50]  Otherwise, you won't hear Jesus' call on your life because you'll be too busy looking around at all those people you disagree with.
[673.04 --> 677.64]  Look at who he's eating with as opposed to, gee, maybe I could eat with Jesus.
[679.64 --> 684.22]  And Jesus says, these people actually hear me because they know they're poor in spirit.
[684.50 --> 686.26]  They mourn the brokenness in their lives.
[686.26 --> 688.04]  And they're hungry for more.
[689.46 --> 690.74]  And they know they need mercy.
[691.50 --> 694.38]  They know they're Kalau Nacho.
[694.38 --> 696.48]  They know they're not people to do facilities.
[697.54 --> 698.16]  They know they'reидing theienie of evil activities.
[698.16 --> 699.32]  They know they're just as good as God cannot be pried on their lives.
[701.74 --> 704.74]  And he can't get 25% people out of their lives who have any clothing.
[709.56 --> 711.64]  And he can't go to school with school business anymore.
[712.34 --> 713.74]  They have to take an advantage over their lives.
[714.66 --> 715.86]  But I'm sorry, many of us being.
[719.32 --> 720.24]  I'm sorry.
[720.24 --> 721.30]  Many of us are in the right now.
[721.30 --> 728.06]  And then there's this flawed approach as well, you know, where people might say,
[728.38 --> 734.12]  Sinners? Sinners? Come now, now, now. How primitive. How outdated a word.
[734.54 --> 736.68]  We're beyond that ancient thinking, aren't we?
[737.76 --> 738.74]  And I've heard people like that.
[739.12 --> 743.22]  And if you think that way, you won't need to have any mercy.
[743.62 --> 745.72]  What for? Nothing's wrong.
[745.72 --> 754.66]  Everyone is sick, although they may not know it.
[756.60 --> 760.30]  Jesus says in our passage, go and learn what that means.
[761.24 --> 762.74]  For you, go and learn what it means.
[763.58 --> 769.84]  Because you won't know unless you humble yourself and know deeply your need for mercy.
[769.84 --> 778.08]  I was reading a prayer out of Cranmer's Book of Common Prayer.
[778.34 --> 779.60]  We'll have it up on the screen here.
[780.46 --> 781.30]  Pray this.
[782.46 --> 786.28]  We have left undone those things which we ought to have done.
[787.48 --> 791.08]  And we have done those things which we ought not have done.
[791.08 --> 794.32]  And there's no health in us.
[799.46 --> 802.36]  When you're saying, I truly need a doctor, I truly need mercy.
[803.96 --> 805.60]  Go learn what that means.
[806.76 --> 807.52]  Meditate on that.
[807.60 --> 808.68]  Look deep within yourself.
[808.86 --> 810.12]  Talk to other people about this.
[810.38 --> 811.22]  Pray about this.
[811.64 --> 814.54]  You know, Jesus, in this passage, quotes a bit out of the Old Testament.
[814.68 --> 815.66]  Isaiah and Hosea.
[815.96 --> 817.72]  Basically kind of saying, you fools.
[817.92 --> 819.18]  Talking to Israel, but to us as well.
[819.18 --> 822.98]  You fools, you're bringing sacrifices, your tithes, your rituals.
[823.20 --> 825.52]  But that's not what God is after.
[827.68 --> 828.84]  He wants you.
[830.54 --> 831.76]  Look at Romans 12.
[831.82 --> 832.28]  What does he want?
[832.36 --> 834.62]  Romans 12, Paul writes this beautiful passage.
[835.28 --> 839.06]  Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy.
[839.12 --> 840.34]  Okay, so the mercy you understand.
[840.64 --> 843.04]  In view of God's mercy.
[843.56 --> 843.78]  What?
[843.78 --> 850.16]  To offer your bodies, yourself, as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God.
[850.48 --> 852.00]  This is your true and proper worship.
[852.40 --> 854.36]  Don't conform to the patterns of this world.
[855.30 --> 858.16]  Be transformed by the renewing of your minds and the work of the Spirit in you.
[861.06 --> 866.00]  Too many people that are sacrificed in order to put God in a position to owe them blessings.
[866.00 --> 868.82]  Look what I'm doing for you, God.
[869.06 --> 869.18]  Right?
[870.42 --> 873.50]  How do you know if you're doing that in your life?
[874.18 --> 875.44]  Let me offer a few thoughts.
[877.48 --> 882.60]  You might be that kind of person if you're always upset when life isn't going the way you want.
[883.90 --> 886.18]  You're trying so hard and God's not doing His part.
[886.24 --> 886.94]  He's letting you down.
[886.94 --> 891.50]  Or you're not aware then of your poverty of spirit.
[891.74 --> 894.04]  You're not mourning your own brokenness or the brokenness around you.
[894.22 --> 896.80]  You're not aware of your desperate need for mercy.
[897.36 --> 900.04]  And Jesus is saying, look how anxious you are.
[900.28 --> 904.02]  Look at how hard you're trying to control it all, to manipulate it all.
[904.32 --> 908.96]  Even your sacrifice and what you give are about you being in control.
[910.88 --> 911.58]  Jesus says, quit it.
[912.76 --> 913.30]  Quit it.
[913.30 --> 915.10]  You need a doctor.
[916.94 --> 919.18]  You need mercy.
[919.70 --> 922.94]  Look at how much God wants to love you and how He wants to transform you.
[923.20 --> 925.20]  So you in turn can love well.
[925.46 --> 926.24]  Love yourself.
[926.44 --> 927.02]  Love your neighbors.
[927.16 --> 927.50]  Love God.
[927.76 --> 931.94]  And then you sacrifice by giving yourself, your life, to this God of love.
[932.10 --> 935.32]  Because you know you owe Him everything.
[937.16 --> 937.64]  Everything.
[939.24 --> 942.96]  And His ways should be your greatest desire.
[943.22 --> 943.96]  His ways.
[943.96 --> 947.56]  So you're desperate to know God's will so you can do that.
[949.80 --> 951.04]  Is that how it goes for you?
[953.52 --> 954.94]  Too often the answer is no.
[956.40 --> 959.78]  Too often we don't love well God, our neighbors, ourselves.
[960.44 --> 965.20]  And therefore we need mercy again and again and again.
[965.20 --> 971.68]  So interesting to me when you read the Sermon on the Mount, how Jesus will say things that,
[971.74 --> 973.78]  you know, the law says, the law says don't kill.
[973.88 --> 979.82]  But I say to you, don't even resent or put down others, even those you strongly disagree with.
[981.38 --> 981.52]  Right?
[981.56 --> 982.32]  Don't commit adultery.
[982.38 --> 984.60]  But I say to you, don't look in lust.
[984.86 --> 986.38]  Not even on a screen.
[989.26 --> 991.08]  Murder, adultery, big sins, right?
[991.08 --> 994.74]  And Jesus says, those are in your hearts too.
[998.82 --> 1000.00]  Look at your heart.
[1001.04 --> 1002.56]  Your motives, your thoughts.
[1003.40 --> 1004.18]  Your arrogance.
[1005.42 --> 1008.94]  And then you'll see how in need of mercy you are.
[1010.58 --> 1014.30]  And you realize only Christ can save you and only He can change you.
[1014.30 --> 1017.40]  And He's calling you to eat with Him.
[1018.04 --> 1022.76]  And to not look at your sacrifices, but to look at His sacrifice.
[1024.00 --> 1025.90]  And then you'll learn what mercy is about.
[1026.16 --> 1027.50]  And then you'll share that.
[1028.24 --> 1032.72]  And you'll always eat with sinners because you always do anyways.
[1032.92 --> 1034.16]  Even when you're alone.
[1035.62 --> 1037.16]  You're always eating with the sinner.
[1037.16 --> 1041.38]  Another thing.
[1042.76 --> 1045.92]  When people come to you with real failures, right?
[1046.10 --> 1049.34]  They've let down themselves or their families, God.
[1049.94 --> 1050.80]  How do you treat them?
[1052.36 --> 1053.18]  How do you treat them?
[1054.12 --> 1056.16]  Blessed are the merciful, they will receive mercy.
[1056.88 --> 1060.16]  So, they get it, so then they give it.
[1060.40 --> 1062.92]  Or are you impatient and self-righteous?
[1062.92 --> 1065.70]  Why can't they simply get it together?
[1067.38 --> 1070.70]  How can anybody do that especially to me?
[1073.52 --> 1079.76]  And then you really don't believe you need as much mercy as that person who offended you.
[1080.94 --> 1084.68]  You don't believe you're just a sinner like anybody else.
[1085.52 --> 1086.82]  So, you don't give mercy.
[1088.06 --> 1090.96]  And people don't come to you because you don't love like Jesus.
[1090.96 --> 1095.18]  How do you treat failure in others?
[1095.42 --> 1097.10]  Like Jesus or like the Pharisees?
[1098.78 --> 1100.16]  And how about your own failures?
[1101.42 --> 1103.30]  When you fail, are you devastated?
[1103.44 --> 1105.10]  You can't face God or others.
[1105.32 --> 1106.42]  You can't even look in the mirror.
[1106.64 --> 1108.14]  So, you hide and you pretend.
[1108.44 --> 1109.86]  You put on your religious mask.
[1110.00 --> 1111.48]  And you beat yourself up regularly.
[1111.70 --> 1114.66]  And you have no idea what Jesus' love and mercy look like.
[1114.82 --> 1116.00]  And you don't see a Savior.
[1116.14 --> 1118.12]  So, you try to be your own Savior.
[1118.38 --> 1119.40]  And you're alone.
[1119.40 --> 1119.46]  You're alone.
[1121.74 --> 1125.36]  Needing real mercy but never getting it and never knowing how to give it either.
[1130.10 --> 1133.16]  Made me think when I was writing this about Ephesians 2.
[1133.90 --> 1136.62]  Wonderful passage we read in Ephesians 2, 8-10.
[1137.22 --> 1137.82]  Where we read,
[1137.82 --> 1139.38]  It is by grace.
[1140.16 --> 1140.68]  You.
[1141.60 --> 1142.76]  Don't make it plural.
[1142.90 --> 1143.64]  Just make it singular.
[1144.00 --> 1147.68]  You have been saved through faith.
[1148.16 --> 1151.02]  This is not from yourselves.
[1151.52 --> 1152.88]  It is the gift of God.
[1152.88 --> 1166.52]  Jesus calls you.
[1167.02 --> 1169.66]  Do you hear His voice?
[1169.66 --> 1173.64]  Come to the table.
[1174.64 --> 1176.44]  Come to the table no matter what you've done.
[1177.14 --> 1178.20]  No matter who you are.
[1179.18 --> 1180.26]  Come and receive mercy.
[1180.42 --> 1180.92]  My mercy.
[1181.46 --> 1183.52]  And in turn, learn to love like me.
[1184.50 --> 1186.24]  And show mercy to those around you.
[1187.72 --> 1189.30]  Blessed are the merciful.
[1190.00 --> 1192.88]  For they shall receive and give mercy.
[1193.80 --> 1194.46]  Let's pray.
[1197.84 --> 1202.80]  Father God, we come before you and we thank you, Lord, for being such a merciful Father.
[1204.68 --> 1208.68]  Lord, forgive us for the times when we're not particularly good at show mercy.
[1208.68 --> 1215.98]  Forgive us for the times when we think higher of ourselves than we should.
[1217.64 --> 1220.98]  Forgive us at those times when we think lower of ourselves than we should.
[1222.60 --> 1225.32]  May we all realize we need mercy.
[1225.98 --> 1226.68]  We need you.
[1227.80 --> 1235.04]  We all stand broken and sinful in need of your sacrifice, in need of your grace.
[1235.04 --> 1241.62]  Lord, make us ever aware of your love for us and our need for you.
[1242.16 --> 1243.64]  In Jesus' name, amen.
