[0.00 --> 6.26]  Good morning, Hope.
[10.26 --> 14.52]  Before we start, I do want to...
[14.52 --> 17.54]  Joe's prayer reminded me also in the first service
[17.54 --> 21.84]  that in our effort to come together in unity and with one voice,
[21.84 --> 26.42]  we have another joint service among the Cloverdale churches coming up.
[26.42 --> 30.94]  So last Sunday of May, so May 28th at 7 p.m.,
[30.94 --> 34.32]  we are going to be gathering at Sunrise Church just down the road
[34.32 --> 39.24]  to celebrate the coming of the Holy Spirit after the ascension of Christ.
[39.60 --> 41.24]  And so we call that the Pentecost Sunday.
[41.84 --> 44.02]  And so in our effort to come together,
[44.20 --> 47.52]  we are joining again to worship with one voice.
[48.44 --> 49.86]  The service reminds me,
[50.08 --> 53.06]  we actually hosted the Pentecost service here last year.
[53.06 --> 56.76]  And that's actually the day that my son Timothy was born,
[57.36 --> 62.10]  which was why I wasn't able to be there at the service.
[62.56 --> 64.04]  I'm hoping to make this one.
[64.12 --> 66.66]  No babies coming up, so I don't have any excuse.
[67.40 --> 69.08]  I'm hoping to make the service for that,
[69.18 --> 70.70]  and I invite you to come together.
[71.46 --> 75.12]  Also, one more plug before we get started here.
[75.66 --> 78.60]  So when Dave left on the last week of April,
[78.84 --> 80.42]  we had a lot of things going on.
[80.42 --> 84.32]  And Dave said goodbye to the Herods, the younger Herods,
[84.60 --> 85.92]  in the 9 a.m. service.
[86.38 --> 88.50]  But with all the chaos,
[88.82 --> 91.44]  we weren't able to officially say goodbye to the Herods.
[91.82 --> 95.44]  And I am aware that Joel's family is here with us this morning.
[95.80 --> 98.94]  And so we get the opportunity in the 11 a.m. service
[98.94 --> 102.82]  to say goodbye to Joel, Christina, Francis, and Alice.
[102.82 --> 104.88]  Thank you so much for being with us,
[105.16 --> 106.40]  having served with us,
[106.48 --> 107.98]  and worshiping together with us.
[108.16 --> 109.20]  And we're going to miss you.
[109.62 --> 111.74]  And so we say goodbye to Joel, who's sitting right there.
[112.04 --> 113.72]  Please make sure to say goodbye to him.
[114.10 --> 114.56]  Yeah.
[114.94 --> 115.98]  And their family.
[116.86 --> 117.56]  Thank you.
[117.56 --> 124.30]  And so it is my privilege for me to lead us
[124.30 --> 127.02]  as we continue through the journey through the Beatitudes.
[127.62 --> 130.54]  And before going into the first one that we'll look at today,
[131.38 --> 135.08]  our paintings or our banners here reflect the message.
[135.48 --> 138.08]  And the overall message of the Beatitudes,
[138.24 --> 142.80]  I want to remind us that it is a calling of our identity
[142.80 --> 144.38]  as Beatitude people.
[144.38 --> 146.96]  And so to be disciples, right,
[147.06 --> 149.62]  to be students of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[149.98 --> 152.34]  it means that we are Beatitude people.
[152.70 --> 154.00]  Those go hand in hand.
[155.08 --> 158.04]  As Pastor Sid highlighted for us last week,
[158.60 --> 161.14]  so Beatitude, that word might not be familiar.
[161.30 --> 162.84]  Like my wife wasn't familiar with it.
[162.94 --> 165.26]  Obviously, it's not the word we use in Korean.
[165.98 --> 168.86]  But Beatitude simply meaning blessed.
[169.68 --> 171.78]  And Pastor Sid explained for us this.
[171.78 --> 176.44]  To be blessed means to be this way, right side up,
[177.02 --> 179.34]  in sync with God's will type of people.
[179.66 --> 181.68]  Those are Beatitude people.
[182.58 --> 186.06]  And the first Beatitude that Jesus blesses us with
[186.06 --> 187.72]  starts off by saying,
[188.72 --> 189.88]  blessed are the poor.
[190.60 --> 192.32]  Blessed are the poor in spirit,
[193.02 --> 194.82]  for yours is the kingdom of heaven.
[196.28 --> 198.26]  Now, we only have a few verses,
[198.46 --> 199.80]  and they'll be up on the screen for you,
[199.80 --> 201.00]  so I'll read it for us.
[201.06 --> 202.30]  If you have your Bibles with you,
[202.36 --> 203.94]  we are in Matthew chapter 5.
[204.70 --> 206.20]  But these are the first verses.
[207.40 --> 208.88]  Now, when Jesus saw the crowds,
[209.04 --> 211.26]  he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
[212.02 --> 213.38]  His disciples came to him,
[213.40 --> 214.82]  and he began to teach them.
[215.56 --> 217.30]  Blessed are the poor in spirit,
[217.46 --> 219.60]  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[219.60 --> 222.76]  So, simply put,
[223.24 --> 224.12]  blessed people,
[224.66 --> 226.88]  in sync with God's will type of people.
[227.40 --> 228.50]  Blessed are you,
[229.34 --> 230.72]  who are poor in spirit,
[231.06 --> 233.96]  who are in utter dependence to God.
[234.84 --> 235.88]  Yours is the kingdom.
[237.24 --> 239.90]  And thinking about being utterly dependent,
[240.08 --> 242.70]  this concept will come up over and over again.
[243.16 --> 243.60]  Utter dependence.
[243.60 --> 244.14]  Utter dependence.
[245.10 --> 246.36]  And thinking about this,
[246.72 --> 248.64]  many different images came to mind for me.
[248.64 --> 250.94]  And one rather powerful image
[250.94 --> 253.26]  was shared with me by Val this past week,
[253.34 --> 254.92]  who has first-hand experience
[254.92 --> 256.42]  in living through a flood.
[257.62 --> 259.64]  And so, when something like a flood
[259.64 --> 262.52]  totally envelops and consumes your home,
[262.86 --> 265.34]  there is absolutely nothing you can do.
[266.34 --> 267.64]  You cannot depend,
[267.90 --> 269.18]  you cannot help yourself,
[269.44 --> 271.78]  but depend on somebody else's help.
[272.68 --> 274.70]  So, any credentials you might have,
[274.78 --> 275.70]  any credit cards,
[275.70 --> 276.70]  or even cash,
[276.90 --> 278.38]  if you still have those kind of things.
[278.98 --> 279.42]  Degrees,
[279.58 --> 280.58]  like your self-interest,
[280.72 --> 281.44]  your investments,
[281.84 --> 284.90]  anything that you would usually rely on for life,
[285.48 --> 288.18]  they have no use in a flood.
[289.54 --> 290.66]  And it's interesting,
[291.28 --> 292.40]  in an instance where,
[292.66 --> 293.86]  if you go through a flood,
[294.72 --> 296.08]  we as human beings,
[296.40 --> 300.08]  we instinctively want to rely on our own strength.
[300.08 --> 303.22]  We don't want to depend on others for help.
[303.52 --> 305.34]  That is not our first instinct.
[306.68 --> 308.96]  And so, trying to apply that in my own life,
[309.02 --> 312.18]  because I haven't necessarily been through a flood directly,
[312.70 --> 313.36]  I was thinking,
[313.82 --> 316.18]  so, having been through many sports injuries,
[316.32 --> 317.74]  pretty bad ones at times too,
[318.28 --> 319.62]  I was reminded that,
[319.82 --> 321.98]  yes, I hate depending on others.
[322.58 --> 323.46]  I've been on crutches,
[323.66 --> 324.74]  I've been on wheelchairs too.
[324.90 --> 326.36]  I don't want people to help me.
[326.84 --> 328.10]  I'll do my own thing,
[328.18 --> 328.78]  I'll recover,
[329.02 --> 330.90]  I want to live by my own strength.
[331.72 --> 334.50]  And I know that this young adult can relate with me,
[334.60 --> 335.72]  because he said the same thing.
[335.86 --> 337.56]  Now, I won't name this person,
[338.32 --> 340.86]  but I had his permission to share this.
[340.94 --> 343.02]  But when I was grabbing lunch with this young adult,
[343.88 --> 346.18]  he recently, having been through an injury,
[346.34 --> 347.26]  told me flat out,
[347.74 --> 350.06]  John, like, I just don't like you helping me.
[350.06 --> 351.94]  I just don't like being helped.
[352.94 --> 356.62]  The injury reminded him of how frustrating it feels
[356.62 --> 357.92]  when you are helpless,
[358.24 --> 359.94]  and you need to depend on others.
[360.38 --> 362.66]  So he got mad at me for opening the door for him,
[362.76 --> 364.26]  you know, I'm just trying to be a nice guy.
[364.94 --> 367.52]  And he wanted to keep doing everything on his own.
[368.40 --> 370.14]  Two crutches, both arms,
[370.32 --> 371.34]  and he's going, he's like,
[371.38 --> 372.34]  I'm going to get a refill,
[372.48 --> 374.16]  I'm going to get my own drink, right?
[374.40 --> 375.52]  Like, good luck with that.
[375.52 --> 380.54]  And so, again, our instinct and our posture
[380.54 --> 382.46]  as broken human beings
[382.46 --> 386.00]  is a natural instinct to be independent.
[386.90 --> 388.32]  And that word independent
[388.32 --> 390.84]  can mean good things at certain times.
[391.12 --> 392.42]  We want to raise our children
[392.42 --> 394.34]  to be independent in certain areas.
[394.86 --> 397.06]  But here today, biblically speaking,
[397.78 --> 399.86]  in our broken, sinful nature,
[399.86 --> 403.44]  we want to naturally rely on our own strength
[403.44 --> 405.80]  to solve all of our life's problems,
[406.02 --> 407.94]  even when it comes to salvation,
[408.22 --> 410.02]  which can only come from God.
[411.46 --> 413.16]  And so that's the irony
[413.16 --> 416.08]  that Jesus starts this series of Beatitudes with.
[416.86 --> 418.94]  He says that those who are poor,
[419.68 --> 421.72]  so those who are utterly dependent,
[422.94 --> 425.26]  you shall inherit the eternal kingdom of God.
[426.16 --> 427.04]  That's ironic.
[427.04 --> 429.76]  It's, in a way, upside down.
[431.16 --> 432.48]  And so, Jesus, what are you saying?
[432.76 --> 435.16]  You don't have to be the heir of Queen Elizabeth
[435.16 --> 436.12]  to inherit a kingdom.
[437.14 --> 439.46]  You are saying that I, with nothing,
[440.62 --> 443.66]  who have absolutely nothing and know it,
[443.92 --> 447.04]  you're saying that kingdom of yours is mine.
[448.88 --> 451.38]  And so I think it is significant to mention
[451.38 --> 453.14]  that the Greek word Jesus,
[453.42 --> 454.98]  that the biblical writers used
[454.98 --> 457.64]  when it says poor in spirit, poor.
[458.54 --> 460.42]  There are two Greek words for it,
[460.46 --> 462.48]  but the specific word that Jesus uses here
[462.48 --> 463.70]  is patohos.
[464.62 --> 466.44]  And many scholars say this word,
[466.58 --> 468.10]  this Greek word patohos,
[468.22 --> 469.94]  comes from the Hebrew words
[469.94 --> 472.08]  either avion or ani.
[472.74 --> 474.96]  And all of these words just simply mean,
[475.08 --> 477.42]  and I quote from the book that I read this from,
[477.42 --> 479.00]  the person who,
[479.52 --> 483.28]  because they have no earthly resources whatsoever,
[484.42 --> 486.20]  puts their whole trust in God.
[487.16 --> 489.06]  This is what all these words mean.
[489.18 --> 490.74]  This is what poor in spirit,
[490.94 --> 493.48]  or just poor in the case of the Gospel of Luke.
[493.74 --> 494.98]  They all just mean,
[495.36 --> 498.06]  you have absolutely nothing and you know it.
[499.36 --> 500.50]  That's poor.
[501.14 --> 502.12]  That's being poor.
[502.12 --> 505.20]  And the same word is used in Psalms 34.
[506.64 --> 508.64]  It's obviously the Hebrew word here,
[508.72 --> 510.58]  and it says in Psalms 34, 6,
[511.20 --> 512.74]  this ani man,
[513.02 --> 515.10]  this poor person called,
[515.48 --> 516.12]  cried out,
[516.64 --> 517.38]  and Yahweh,
[517.56 --> 518.92]  so the personal name of our God,
[519.26 --> 520.90]  and Yahweh heard him,
[521.42 --> 524.18]  and Yahweh saved him from all of his troubles.
[525.48 --> 526.78]  Poor person,
[527.26 --> 528.24]  poor man.
[528.24 --> 531.90]  Total dependence on God.
[532.88 --> 534.40]  And so that's the takeaway
[534.40 --> 537.36]  for the Gospel message for us this morning, Hope.
[537.76 --> 538.88]  If you take away anything,
[539.02 --> 540.26]  this is the central message.
[540.66 --> 543.00]  We are called to be Beatitude people.
[543.46 --> 545.92]  We are called to reflect kingdom people
[545.92 --> 547.84]  in our Christ-likeness.
[548.68 --> 549.50]  And ironically,
[549.98 --> 551.26]  this Christ-likeness
[551.26 --> 553.66]  comes not out of our own strength,
[553.66 --> 556.98]  but in total dependence on God.
[556.98 --> 558.60]  And he says,
[559.22 --> 559.40]  there,
[559.92 --> 561.12]  yours is the kingdom.
[562.44 --> 563.92]  And so this is good news.
[564.28 --> 566.08]  This is the Gospel for us this morning.
[566.74 --> 567.82]  Yours is the kingdom,
[568.10 --> 570.68]  and you are equipped now by His Spirit
[570.68 --> 573.78]  to live into that kingdom here and now.
[575.12 --> 576.32]  In utter dependence,
[576.92 --> 578.28]  reflecting Beatitude people,
[578.84 --> 579.50]  here and now,
[579.66 --> 580.36]  by His Spirit.
[580.36 --> 583.88]  And so before we dive further into
[583.88 --> 585.30]  what being poor in spirit
[585.30 --> 586.64]  would look like
[586.64 --> 588.20]  or means for our lives today,
[588.58 --> 591.16]  I want to remind us of the context again.
[591.88 --> 594.88]  Because without the broader Gospel context,
[595.18 --> 596.58]  the broader Gospel story
[596.58 --> 598.06]  that Jesus is speaking from,
[598.70 --> 599.50]  without that,
[600.06 --> 600.72]  all of this,
[600.82 --> 602.44]  as Daryl Johnson puts it in his book,
[602.84 --> 603.92]  it can either become
[603.92 --> 605.20]  one of two things.
[605.40 --> 606.00]  Either one,
[606.32 --> 607.70]  frustrating idealism,
[607.70 --> 610.34]  or oppressive legalism.
[610.94 --> 612.06]  And allow me to explain.
[612.44 --> 613.94]  And so if we're trying to live
[613.94 --> 615.86]  by the standards of the Beatitudes,
[616.00 --> 617.74]  all the beautiful qualities
[617.74 --> 619.50]  that Jesus gives us with,
[619.86 --> 621.56]  including His Sermon on the Mount,
[621.94 --> 623.32]  all these moral standards
[623.32 --> 626.24]  that are seemingly impossible to live by,
[627.84 --> 629.32]  it can either be
[629.32 --> 631.34]  frustrating idealism
[631.34 --> 632.86]  or oppressive legalism
[632.86 --> 634.28]  if you're not looking at this
[634.28 --> 636.22]  from the broader Gospel context.
[637.02 --> 637.94]  So, first one,
[638.02 --> 639.18]  frustrating idealism.
[639.32 --> 640.36]  Because, like I said,
[640.44 --> 642.14]  it is so, so hard.
[642.56 --> 644.70]  And in our biblical terms,
[645.02 --> 646.74]  it is impossible, we say,
[647.22 --> 648.08]  for sinful people
[648.08 --> 649.62]  to be perfectly obedient
[649.62 --> 650.68]  to the qualities
[650.68 --> 652.12]  that Jesus describes
[652.12 --> 653.06]  in His Sermon on the Mount,
[653.28 --> 654.32]  including the Beatitudes.
[654.78 --> 656.30]  So, frustrating idealism.
[656.74 --> 657.38]  It's hard to get.
[657.82 --> 658.70]  It's almost impossible.
[659.02 --> 660.02]  And we say it is impossible.
[661.00 --> 661.80]  And the other side,
[662.10 --> 663.02]  oppressive legalism.
[663.02 --> 665.00]  Because, when,
[665.58 --> 666.42]  so not if,
[667.00 --> 668.60]  when we do fail
[668.60 --> 670.10]  to live up to these standards,
[670.66 --> 672.70]  we have potential,
[672.84 --> 673.44]  we are tempted
[673.44 --> 674.76]  to judge ourselves
[674.76 --> 676.88]  and also to judge one another
[676.88 --> 678.62]  for not being good enough,
[678.92 --> 680.68]  for not being a good enough Christian.
[681.84 --> 683.38]  And for me personally,
[683.72 --> 685.60]  that's where I felt
[685.60 --> 686.66]  the pressures growing up
[686.66 --> 687.60]  in my Christian faith.
[688.50 --> 690.14]  I thought early on,
[690.54 --> 692.14]  I thought that being humble enough,
[692.14 --> 693.52]  relying on God enough,
[693.68 --> 694.28]  praying enough,
[694.36 --> 695.40]  reading the Bible enough,
[695.62 --> 697.04]  serving the church enough,
[697.20 --> 699.20]  would result in me
[699.20 --> 699.90]  being good enough
[699.90 --> 700.90]  to enter God's kingdom.
[702.10 --> 703.98]  You see how that's upside down?
[705.14 --> 706.74]  Being a good enough Christian
[706.74 --> 708.14]  so that I may be able
[708.14 --> 710.08]  to satisfy everyone in my church,
[710.16 --> 710.78]  all the elders,
[710.96 --> 711.48]  all the deacons,
[711.56 --> 712.32]  all the expectations,
[712.74 --> 713.42]  my parents,
[713.56 --> 714.72]  my dad being the pastor,
[715.06 --> 715.62]  my family,
[715.72 --> 716.36]  my siblings,
[716.76 --> 718.16]  all the people around me,
[718.28 --> 719.60]  and ultimately God.
[719.60 --> 721.52]  God, am I good enough?
[722.16 --> 723.72]  Am I now allowed
[723.72 --> 725.32]  to enter God's kingdom?
[726.56 --> 728.46]  So that's the potential
[728.46 --> 729.90]  oppressive legalism
[729.90 --> 731.38]  that we can be tempted in
[731.38 --> 732.28]  if we don't have
[732.28 --> 733.70]  this gospel context.
[734.88 --> 736.74]  And that's Jesus' context.
[736.94 --> 738.46]  That's where he's preaching from.
[739.44 --> 740.78]  He's saying that we're not
[740.78 --> 741.88]  to live poorly,
[742.10 --> 742.48]  meekly,
[742.60 --> 742.90]  humbly,
[743.04 --> 743.46]  righteously,
[743.66 --> 744.82]  all in order
[744.82 --> 746.02]  to enter God's kingdom,
[746.22 --> 747.18]  to punch our ticket
[747.18 --> 747.98]  into his kingdom,
[747.98 --> 749.46]  but the gospel message
[749.46 --> 751.18]  is that because God
[751.18 --> 752.06]  has called us
[752.06 --> 752.86]  broken,
[753.36 --> 754.20]  sinful people
[754.20 --> 755.24]  into his kingdom,
[755.84 --> 756.80]  we are now,
[757.08 --> 758.20]  by his spirit,
[758.60 --> 759.84]  enabled and equipped
[759.84 --> 761.48]  to reflect
[761.48 --> 763.08]  all these beautiful qualities
[763.08 --> 764.36]  of being pure in heart,
[764.58 --> 765.44]  of being poor
[765.44 --> 766.96]  and utterly dependent on God,
[767.10 --> 768.64]  to be humble in that way
[768.64 --> 769.48]  and meek
[769.48 --> 771.02]  and all the rest.
[773.20 --> 773.50]  And so,
[773.60 --> 774.34]  beatitude living,
[774.58 --> 774.94]  once again,
[774.94 --> 777.00]  is the result of God
[777.00 --> 778.60]  working in and through us,
[778.84 --> 780.32]  not the other way around.
[780.84 --> 781.16]  Hence,
[781.44 --> 782.56]  upside down kingdom.
[784.58 --> 786.36]  And the beatitude living
[786.36 --> 788.12]  that we are called to,
[788.76 --> 790.06]  and at the very beginning
[790.06 --> 791.80]  of Jesus' proclamation
[791.80 --> 793.44]  of the gospel of the kingdom,
[793.78 --> 794.36]  Jesus comes,
[794.50 --> 795.24]  starts his ministry
[795.24 --> 796.42]  and says,
[797.10 --> 797.92]  what?
[798.52 --> 800.00]  The kingdom has come near.
[800.88 --> 802.58]  His first charge is what?
[802.58 --> 804.80]  Repent,
[805.06 --> 805.84]  for the kingdom
[805.84 --> 806.92]  is now here.
[808.16 --> 808.84]  He says,
[808.96 --> 809.30]  repent.
[809.48 --> 809.96]  And I know
[809.96 --> 811.88]  Pastor Sid highlighted this
[811.88 --> 812.96]  a little bit last week,
[813.10 --> 814.90]  but I want to hone in on this
[814.90 --> 816.24]  for each beatitude
[816.24 --> 817.36]  that we're going to look at.
[818.08 --> 818.54]  And so,
[818.68 --> 819.24]  Jesus says,
[819.34 --> 819.66]  repent,
[819.98 --> 820.98]  for the kingdom of heaven
[820.98 --> 821.70]  has come near.
[822.88 --> 823.36]  Repent,
[823.58 --> 823.90]  meaning,
[824.36 --> 826.14]  realign your thinking.
[827.30 --> 828.00]  In other words,
[828.08 --> 828.96]  like Romans 12,
[828.96 --> 830.28]  be transformed
[830.28 --> 831.60]  by the renewing
[831.60 --> 832.56]  of your mind.
[833.22 --> 834.18]  Then you will know
[834.18 --> 834.88]  God's will.
[835.54 --> 835.88]  Blessed.
[836.92 --> 838.12]  That same blessing
[838.12 --> 838.76]  is proclaimed
[838.76 --> 840.04]  in the first Psalms.
[840.74 --> 841.72]  Blessed are the ones,
[841.80 --> 842.30]  and then we'll skip
[842.30 --> 842.96]  the negative ones.
[843.28 --> 844.14]  And then the second part,
[844.48 --> 845.56]  blessed are the ones
[845.56 --> 847.58]  who meditate,
[848.40 --> 849.20]  who think,
[849.32 --> 850.72]  who realign their thinking
[850.72 --> 852.66]  to God's word
[852.66 --> 853.96]  day and night.
[855.56 --> 856.60]  I understand.
[856.60 --> 858.40]  I paraphrased it
[858.40 --> 859.66]  where you could almost
[859.66 --> 861.06]  not recognize the Psalm,
[861.16 --> 862.16]  but that's Psalm 1.
[862.48 --> 863.48]  Blessed are the ones
[863.48 --> 864.32]  who meditate
[864.32 --> 865.44]  on God's word
[865.44 --> 866.58]  day and night,
[866.78 --> 868.50]  who realign their thinking.
[869.22 --> 869.82]  Repentance.
[871.52 --> 873.04]  Our thoughts are aligned
[873.04 --> 873.88]  with the right side
[873.88 --> 874.36]  of our kingdom,
[874.72 --> 876.36]  which is a total
[876.36 --> 877.14]  turning away.
[877.34 --> 878.10]  That's why repentance
[878.10 --> 879.92]  is a 180 degree turn.
[880.28 --> 881.90]  It's a total turning away
[881.90 --> 883.06]  from our old,
[883.26 --> 884.12]  broken selves.
[884.68 --> 885.82]  And our old,
[886.38 --> 886.72]  broken,
[886.92 --> 887.72]  sinful selves,
[887.72 --> 889.26]  which reflect us,
[889.46 --> 890.06]  our instinct
[890.06 --> 890.94]  to pull us
[890.94 --> 892.02]  toward thinking
[892.02 --> 893.20]  that we don't have
[893.20 --> 893.86]  to be dependent
[893.86 --> 894.90]  on anyone else.
[895.12 --> 895.90]  We don't have
[895.90 --> 896.60]  to be dependent
[896.60 --> 897.64]  on God
[897.64 --> 898.84]  even for our salvation
[898.84 --> 900.30]  to enter His kingdom.
[900.82 --> 901.90]  Our old selves
[901.90 --> 902.82]  that tries to always
[902.82 --> 903.82]  take control
[903.82 --> 905.70]  that my own strength,
[905.98 --> 906.88]  my own thought,
[907.16 --> 908.16]  my own wisdom
[908.16 --> 909.16]  is good enough.
[909.34 --> 910.64]  And we end up saying
[910.64 --> 911.68]  or thinking,
[912.76 --> 914.34]  I am always right.
[915.04 --> 916.32]  I am right.
[916.32 --> 918.08]  not anyone else,
[918.18 --> 918.78]  not God.
[919.10 --> 919.76]  So in other words,
[919.98 --> 921.38]  I know what good is
[921.38 --> 923.46]  and I know what evil is.
[923.86 --> 925.72]  I am the rightful judge
[925.72 --> 926.78]  to judge between
[926.78 --> 928.62]  what good and evil is.
[929.48 --> 931.52]  And hopefully that reminds you,
[931.78 --> 932.52]  paints the picture
[932.52 --> 934.16]  of that first rebellion
[934.16 --> 935.66]  us human beings
[935.66 --> 936.96]  rebelled against God with.
[937.72 --> 939.34]  Adam and Eve thinking,
[939.90 --> 940.16]  no,
[940.54 --> 942.66]  God created everything good,
[942.66 --> 943.98]  as it says.
[944.34 --> 945.56]  God created everything
[945.56 --> 946.48]  very good,
[946.48 --> 947.16]  it says.
[947.76 --> 948.92]  But then Adam and Eve
[948.92 --> 949.82]  now knowing
[949.82 --> 950.98]  or judging between,
[951.46 --> 952.24]  thinking they know
[952.24 --> 953.32]  what good and evil is,
[953.58 --> 954.56]  looking at their bodies
[954.56 --> 955.14]  and thinking,
[955.68 --> 955.90]  no,
[956.38 --> 957.60]  this is not good
[957.60 --> 958.26]  that we're naked.
[958.66 --> 959.84]  It is not good
[959.84 --> 960.34]  in the way
[960.34 --> 961.42]  that God created us.
[961.50 --> 962.48]  This is shameful.
[962.88 --> 964.06]  We are now going
[964.06 --> 965.14]  to cover ourselves up.
[965.14 --> 969.34]  So that's the realigned thinking
[969.34 --> 971.02]  of the upside down
[971.02 --> 971.86]  in the perspective
[971.86 --> 973.20]  of our sinful selves,
[973.50 --> 974.16]  in our broken,
[974.42 --> 976.62]  sinful human state.
[978.50 --> 981.10]  And what Jesus now calls us into
[981.10 --> 982.08]  is repentance,
[982.44 --> 984.12]  to now again realign
[984.12 --> 985.50]  our thinking to God's will.
[987.02 --> 989.06]  And this transformation,
[990.36 --> 990.90]  ironically,
[991.16 --> 992.24]  does not start
[992.24 --> 993.62]  by us somehow
[993.62 --> 994.46]  turning our heads
[994.46 --> 995.46]  and realigning
[995.46 --> 996.00]  our thinking.
[996.44 --> 998.24]  This transformation itself
[998.24 --> 1001.32]  comes by His Spirit
[1001.32 --> 1002.00]  leading us
[1002.00 --> 1003.50]  and transforming us.
[1004.20 --> 1005.50]  Be transformed,
[1005.80 --> 1006.32]  Paul says.
[1007.82 --> 1008.58]  Like children
[1008.58 --> 1009.92]  who have nothing to give,
[1010.28 --> 1011.20]  but are utterly
[1011.20 --> 1013.06]  and desperately dependent
[1013.06 --> 1013.76]  to be fed,
[1014.28 --> 1014.64]  nurtured,
[1014.64 --> 1015.48]  and cared for.
[1016.74 --> 1018.20]  Like what can Timothy do
[1018.20 --> 1018.92]  that will make him
[1018.92 --> 1019.42]  good enough
[1019.42 --> 1021.44]  for me to justify me
[1021.44 --> 1022.56]  getting all the diapers
[1022.56 --> 1023.62]  and feeding him every day?
[1024.46 --> 1026.64]  What makes him good enough?
[1027.22 --> 1028.44]  What has he done for me?
[1028.48 --> 1029.86]  Has he paid for all of his
[1029.86 --> 1031.46]  lots of food
[1031.46 --> 1032.62]  that he's eaten so far
[1032.62 --> 1033.48]  and all the diapers
[1033.48 --> 1034.30]  that he's been through?
[1034.92 --> 1036.02]  No, it's not cheap, buddy.
[1036.12 --> 1037.22]  Like, are you going to pay for it?
[1037.68 --> 1038.00]  No.
[1039.14 --> 1040.52]  He's in utter dependence
[1040.52 --> 1041.36]  of parents.
[1043.28 --> 1045.18]  And so this is what Jesus says
[1045.18 --> 1046.28]  as well in Matthew 18.
[1046.28 --> 1048.16]  Unless you become
[1048.16 --> 1049.12]  like little children,
[1049.92 --> 1050.64]  you will never enter
[1050.64 --> 1051.50]  the kingdom of heaven.
[1053.14 --> 1054.30]  And so based off this,
[1054.80 --> 1055.46]  a theologian
[1055.46 --> 1056.22]  by the name of
[1056.22 --> 1056.78]  Brandon Manning,
[1056.94 --> 1057.80]  he says this,
[1058.52 --> 1060.50]  children are our role model
[1060.50 --> 1061.66]  because they have
[1061.66 --> 1062.48]  no claim on heaven.
[1063.48 --> 1065.14]  If they are close to God,
[1065.22 --> 1065.98]  it is not because
[1065.98 --> 1066.78]  they are innocent,
[1067.18 --> 1069.20]  but because they are incompetent.
[1070.64 --> 1072.02]  They are in utter dependence.
[1072.32 --> 1073.32]  And that's the posture
[1073.32 --> 1074.46]  that we are called to.
[1074.46 --> 1076.82]  We are to be like children,
[1077.00 --> 1078.24]  entirely dependent
[1078.24 --> 1079.60]  on our loving Father.
[1081.08 --> 1081.86]  And that is why
[1081.86 --> 1083.44]  even when Luke records
[1083.44 --> 1084.16]  his gospel
[1084.16 --> 1085.60]  in this same beatitude,
[1085.86 --> 1087.22]  it sounds a little different,
[1087.90 --> 1088.92]  but it has the same
[1088.92 --> 1089.76]  gospel message.
[1090.38 --> 1090.92]  For Luke,
[1090.98 --> 1092.04]  he just says simply,
[1092.50 --> 1093.56]  blessed are the poor,
[1093.82 --> 1094.02]  period.
[1095.34 --> 1096.44]  He's not suggesting
[1096.44 --> 1097.94]  that Jesus only blesses
[1097.94 --> 1099.26]  those that are materially poor.
[1100.46 --> 1101.70]  What he's saying
[1101.70 --> 1102.82]  along with Matthew
[1102.82 --> 1104.24]  is the same gospel message
[1104.24 --> 1105.68]  and the same gospel truth,
[1105.92 --> 1106.78]  that we are poor,
[1107.22 --> 1108.84]  that we are in utter dependence,
[1108.92 --> 1109.78]  or we should be,
[1110.20 --> 1111.86]  because we will never
[1111.86 --> 1112.56]  be good enough.
[1113.06 --> 1114.02]  But that's the way
[1114.02 --> 1115.26]  that God has called us
[1115.26 --> 1116.02]  into his kingdom.
[1117.02 --> 1118.78]  And being in utter dependence
[1118.78 --> 1119.44]  and meekness
[1119.44 --> 1120.12]  and humility
[1120.12 --> 1120.82]  and righteousness,
[1121.16 --> 1121.90]  those are fruits
[1121.90 --> 1122.88]  that come out of
[1122.88 --> 1123.86]  God's Spirit
[1123.86 --> 1125.18]  transforming us.
[1125.18 --> 1129.52]  and so I did want to mention
[1129.52 --> 1130.48]  this specifically.
[1130.94 --> 1132.42]  See, the opposite of poor
[1132.42 --> 1133.00]  in the Bible,
[1133.42 --> 1134.70]  as Daryl Johnson explains,
[1134.78 --> 1135.72]  and I think this was actually
[1135.72 --> 1136.40]  pretty powerful,
[1137.10 --> 1138.30]  the opposite of poor
[1138.30 --> 1138.94]  in the Bible
[1138.94 --> 1140.28]  is not rich,
[1140.74 --> 1141.88]  simply materially poor,
[1141.98 --> 1142.66]  materially rich.
[1143.16 --> 1144.82]  So Jesus only blesses
[1144.82 --> 1145.18]  the poor.
[1145.18 --> 1147.02]  No, the opposite of poor,
[1147.12 --> 1148.14]  actually, he suggests,
[1148.50 --> 1149.60]  is the word violent.
[1151.30 --> 1151.90]  Poor?
[1152.20 --> 1153.10]  Opposite violent?
[1153.10 --> 1155.82]  Violent, he explains,
[1155.96 --> 1157.20]  because violence
[1157.20 --> 1158.92]  describes a person
[1158.92 --> 1161.06]  who takes the ultimate extremes
[1161.06 --> 1162.60]  to take control
[1162.60 --> 1163.78]  into their own hands.
[1165.10 --> 1166.70]  That's why the opposite
[1166.70 --> 1167.36]  of poor,
[1167.46 --> 1168.58]  being in utter dependence,
[1169.18 --> 1171.10]  is actually the word violence.
[1173.50 --> 1174.60]  And so remember,
[1174.80 --> 1175.30]  this word,
[1175.72 --> 1176.84]  patahos, the poor,
[1177.44 --> 1178.38]  is not just someone
[1178.38 --> 1179.28]  who lacks a little bit,
[1179.36 --> 1180.10]  who's a little bit
[1180.10 --> 1180.92]  financially poor
[1180.92 --> 1182.02]  on the lower end
[1182.02 --> 1183.06]  of the social scale.
[1183.22 --> 1184.38]  That's not the description.
[1184.94 --> 1185.66]  Poor, here,
[1185.78 --> 1186.56]  this word means
[1186.56 --> 1188.50]  you have absolutely nothing
[1188.50 --> 1189.28]  and you know it.
[1191.86 --> 1192.94]  And so in light
[1192.94 --> 1193.92]  of the good announcement
[1193.92 --> 1194.76]  that Jesus says,
[1194.90 --> 1195.88]  yes, out of that
[1195.88 --> 1197.20]  poor utter dependence
[1197.20 --> 1198.04]  I've called you,
[1198.78 --> 1199.58]  in light of that
[1199.58 --> 1200.50]  gospel message,
[1200.50 --> 1201.62]  we are welcomed
[1201.62 --> 1203.00]  into God's kingdom
[1203.00 --> 1205.12]  out of His mercy
[1205.12 --> 1205.72]  and love.
[1207.26 --> 1208.16]  And so the invitation
[1208.16 --> 1208.84]  this morning
[1208.84 --> 1209.52]  for us too
[1209.52 --> 1210.16]  is to bring
[1210.16 --> 1211.52]  all of our brokenness
[1211.52 --> 1213.16]  and all of our sinfulness,
[1213.62 --> 1214.76]  everything that we lack,
[1215.34 --> 1216.80]  not to make it pretty
[1216.80 --> 1217.62]  and make it good enough
[1217.62 --> 1218.74]  and then present it to God,
[1218.92 --> 1219.22]  no,
[1219.32 --> 1220.00]  but to bring
[1220.00 --> 1221.06]  in all honesty
[1221.06 --> 1222.24]  and humility
[1222.24 --> 1223.14]  and bring them
[1223.14 --> 1224.04]  before God
[1224.04 --> 1224.74]  as you are.
[1224.74 --> 1228.40]  yes,
[1228.40 --> 1229.40]  we are entirely
[1229.40 --> 1230.24]  at the mercy
[1230.24 --> 1230.86]  of God
[1230.86 --> 1231.72]  and know that
[1231.72 --> 1232.66]  it is by grace
[1232.66 --> 1233.48]  we have been saved.
[1233.70 --> 1234.50]  It is entirely
[1234.50 --> 1235.26]  by grace
[1235.26 --> 1235.80]  that we are
[1235.80 --> 1236.70]  inheritors
[1236.70 --> 1237.66]  of God's kingdom.
[1238.06 --> 1238.40]  Yes,
[1239.02 --> 1239.58]  but you don't
[1239.58 --> 1240.30]  stop there.
[1241.30 --> 1242.22]  We are called
[1242.22 --> 1243.24]  in our brokenness
[1243.24 --> 1243.98]  to reflect
[1243.98 --> 1245.00]  Beatitude people
[1245.00 --> 1246.52]  for the purpose
[1246.52 --> 1247.28]  of reflecting
[1247.28 --> 1247.90]  His kingdom
[1247.90 --> 1248.94]  here and now.
[1249.86 --> 1250.60]  And so the image
[1250.60 --> 1250.98]  is not
[1250.98 --> 1251.70]  at the rooftop
[1251.70 --> 1252.34]  of your house
[1252.34 --> 1252.92]  as your house
[1252.92 --> 1253.66]  is being flooded,
[1254.06 --> 1254.86]  just sitting there
[1254.86 --> 1255.64]  and feeling helpless.
[1257.64 --> 1258.58]  Our call
[1258.58 --> 1259.34]  is to be
[1259.34 --> 1260.06]  on the rooftop
[1260.06 --> 1260.46]  there
[1260.46 --> 1260.88]  or maybe
[1260.88 --> 1262.12]  on a mountainside
[1262.12 --> 1263.10]  and shouting
[1263.10 --> 1263.70]  at the top
[1263.70 --> 1264.36]  of our lungs
[1264.36 --> 1265.12]  that we are
[1265.12 --> 1266.02]  in utter dependence,
[1266.50 --> 1267.08]  we are never
[1267.08 --> 1267.66]  good enough,
[1267.96 --> 1268.72]  but help
[1268.72 --> 1270.06]  comes from
[1270.06 --> 1270.64]  the Lord.
[1271.86 --> 1273.20]  It is by grace
[1273.20 --> 1273.92]  we are saved
[1273.92 --> 1275.12]  and our call
[1275.12 --> 1275.94]  now is to
[1275.94 --> 1276.72]  maybe extend
[1276.72 --> 1277.36]  our hands
[1277.36 --> 1278.16]  even though
[1278.16 --> 1278.92]  we are also
[1278.92 --> 1279.54]  in need
[1279.54 --> 1280.80]  in help
[1280.80 --> 1282.54]  of one another.
[1282.98 --> 1283.54]  Just like
[1283.54 --> 1284.04]  the stories
[1284.04 --> 1284.60]  we heard
[1284.60 --> 1285.46]  even in our
[1285.46 --> 1286.28]  local flood here
[1286.28 --> 1286.76]  that happened
[1286.76 --> 1287.22]  in my old
[1287.22 --> 1288.44]  hometown of Abbotsford
[1288.44 --> 1289.78]  where countless
[1289.78 --> 1290.68]  people came out
[1290.68 --> 1291.48]  to help one another
[1291.48 --> 1292.28]  even though
[1292.28 --> 1293.06]  their house
[1293.06 --> 1293.78]  was being flooded
[1293.78 --> 1294.36]  as well.
[1297.00 --> 1297.72]  There is a
[1297.72 --> 1298.58]  beautiful image
[1298.58 --> 1299.20]  in that
[1299.20 --> 1300.80]  once you are
[1300.80 --> 1301.30]  humbled
[1301.30 --> 1303.02]  it gives you
[1303.02 --> 1303.92]  it allows you
[1303.92 --> 1304.52]  the perspective
[1304.52 --> 1305.34]  of seeing others
[1305.34 --> 1305.98]  who are also
[1305.98 --> 1306.46]  in need
[1306.46 --> 1307.46]  and now
[1307.46 --> 1308.02]  we are called
[1308.02 --> 1308.56]  to reflect
[1308.56 --> 1308.96]  his kingdom
[1308.96 --> 1309.76]  by helping
[1309.76 --> 1310.30]  one another
[1310.30 --> 1311.00]  and serving
[1311.00 --> 1311.66]  one another.
[1312.94 --> 1313.52]  And so that's
[1313.52 --> 1314.50]  a beautiful irony
[1314.50 --> 1315.60]  in our
[1315.60 --> 1316.94]  when we acknowledge
[1316.94 --> 1317.98]  our utter dependence
[1317.98 --> 1319.38]  God calls us
[1319.38 --> 1320.20]  into his kingdom
[1320.20 --> 1321.42]  and by his spirit
[1321.42 --> 1322.74]  now enables
[1322.74 --> 1323.86]  and equips
[1323.86 --> 1324.40]  us
[1324.40 --> 1325.30]  to reflect
[1325.30 --> 1325.92]  that kingdom
[1325.92 --> 1327.06]  here and now.
[1330.24 --> 1331.56]  And this verse
[1331.56 --> 1332.26]  came to mind
[1332.26 --> 1334.48]  this gospel message
[1334.48 --> 1335.88]  in Ephesians 2
[1335.88 --> 1336.46]  8-10
[1336.46 --> 1338.30]  Paul says
[1338.30 --> 1339.52]  for it is by grace
[1339.52 --> 1340.40]  you have been saved
[1340.40 --> 1341.32]  through faith
[1341.32 --> 1342.38]  and this is not
[1342.38 --> 1343.40]  from within yourselves
[1343.40 --> 1344.68]  it is the gift
[1344.68 --> 1345.48]  of God
[1345.48 --> 1346.32]  yes entirely
[1346.32 --> 1347.14]  from God
[1347.14 --> 1348.58]  not by works
[1348.58 --> 1349.62]  so that no one
[1349.62 --> 1350.36]  has the right
[1350.36 --> 1351.04]  to boast
[1351.04 --> 1352.56]  it is by grace
[1352.56 --> 1353.64]  and by grace alone
[1353.64 --> 1355.12]  amen amen amen
[1355.12 --> 1356.74]  that is the gospel message
[1356.74 --> 1357.84]  but Paul doesn't
[1357.84 --> 1358.60]  stop there
[1358.60 --> 1360.26]  Paul goes on
[1360.26 --> 1360.82]  and he says
[1360.82 --> 1362.90]  and we were created
[1362.90 --> 1364.74]  in
[1364.74 --> 1366.30]  we were created
[1366.30 --> 1367.32]  for God's
[1367.32 --> 1368.12]  handiwork
[1368.12 --> 1369.32]  created in
[1369.32 --> 1370.52]  Jesus Christ
[1370.52 --> 1371.48]  to do
[1371.48 --> 1374.30]  good works
[1374.30 --> 1375.88]  which he
[1375.88 --> 1376.46]  prepared
[1376.46 --> 1377.38]  for us
[1377.38 --> 1377.88]  in advance
[1377.88 --> 1378.68]  for us to do
[1378.68 --> 1381.02]  even the work
[1381.02 --> 1381.98]  that we're called to
[1381.98 --> 1383.16]  God has prepared
[1383.16 --> 1383.98]  in advance
[1383.98 --> 1384.92]  for us to do that
[1384.92 --> 1387.90]  yes not by works
[1387.90 --> 1389.08]  not by our own strength
[1389.08 --> 1390.20]  this is the utter
[1390.20 --> 1391.08]  dependence part
[1391.08 --> 1391.92]  it is
[1391.92 --> 1393.08]  we have nothing
[1393.08 --> 1393.54]  to boast
[1393.54 --> 1394.32]  other than Jesus
[1394.32 --> 1396.26]  it is by grace
[1396.26 --> 1397.20]  and by grace alone
[1397.20 --> 1398.04]  that we are saved
[1398.04 --> 1398.94]  but it doesn't
[1398.94 --> 1399.52]  stop there
[1399.52 --> 1400.38]  Paul says
[1400.38 --> 1401.24]  we were created
[1401.24 --> 1402.10]  in Christ Jesus
[1402.10 --> 1403.54]  to do good works
[1403.54 --> 1404.26]  and we have
[1404.26 --> 1405.60]  lots of good works
[1405.60 --> 1406.68]  that God has prepared
[1406.68 --> 1407.18]  for us
[1407.18 --> 1408.52]  here specifically
[1408.52 --> 1409.48]  for our church
[1409.48 --> 1412.10]  it's almost
[1412.10 --> 1412.76]  overwhelming
[1412.76 --> 1413.50]  at times
[1413.50 --> 1415.08]  and I know
[1415.08 --> 1416.10]  sometimes I feel
[1416.10 --> 1416.60]  overwhelmed
[1416.60 --> 1418.04]  but God
[1418.04 --> 1418.62]  without even
[1418.62 --> 1419.30]  planning it
[1419.30 --> 1419.54]  too
[1419.54 --> 1420.74]  we're officially
[1420.74 --> 1421.84]  now a multicultural
[1421.84 --> 1422.44]  church
[1422.44 --> 1424.10]  and supposedly
[1424.10 --> 1424.62]  we're supposed
[1424.62 --> 1425.08]  to get some
[1425.08 --> 1425.80]  official training
[1425.80 --> 1426.60]  done by our
[1426.60 --> 1427.12]  denomination
[1427.12 --> 1428.64]  because we are
[1428.64 --> 1429.46]  a multicultural
[1429.46 --> 1430.02]  church
[1430.02 --> 1432.36]  that's something
[1432.36 --> 1433.40]  God prepared
[1433.40 --> 1434.24]  for us to do
[1434.24 --> 1437.12]  and so
[1437.12 --> 1438.00]  also to be
[1438.00 --> 1438.48]  involved
[1438.48 --> 1439.38]  so involved
[1439.38 --> 1440.04]  in our community
[1440.04 --> 1441.16]  obviously with the
[1441.16 --> 1441.94]  festival yesterday
[1441.94 --> 1442.68]  and all the
[1442.68 --> 1443.56]  ministries that we
[1443.56 --> 1444.20]  take part in
[1444.20 --> 1444.98]  I mean
[1444.98 --> 1445.74]  who would have
[1445.74 --> 1446.22]  thought that
[1446.22 --> 1447.16]  running a cotton
[1447.16 --> 1447.76]  candy machine
[1447.76 --> 1448.30]  would be that
[1448.30 --> 1448.76]  difficult
[1448.76 --> 1449.72]  you know
[1449.72 --> 1451.22]  so
[1451.22 --> 1453.08]  as soon as we
[1453.08 --> 1453.52]  started our
[1453.52 --> 1453.84]  festival
[1453.84 --> 1454.52]  lots of kids
[1454.52 --> 1454.92]  came in
[1454.92 --> 1455.22]  and our
[1455.22 --> 1455.74]  Andre's just
[1455.74 --> 1456.58]  doing a workout
[1456.58 --> 1457.40]  making a whole
[1457.40 --> 1457.96]  bunch of cotton
[1457.96 --> 1458.28]  candy
[1458.28 --> 1458.88]  and we haven't
[1458.88 --> 1459.66]  even started yet
[1459.66 --> 1460.86]  and then Katrina
[1460.86 --> 1461.78]  takes over later
[1461.78 --> 1462.78]  before my shift
[1462.78 --> 1463.88]  and I get to my
[1463.88 --> 1464.40]  shift and I look
[1464.40 --> 1465.10]  at Katrina's face
[1465.10 --> 1465.48]  and I go
[1465.48 --> 1466.08]  why are you
[1466.08 --> 1466.62]  making cotton
[1466.62 --> 1467.22]  candy with your
[1467.22 --> 1467.58]  face
[1467.58 --> 1469.30]  because she had
[1469.30 --> 1470.18]  food coloring
[1470.18 --> 1471.16]  all over her
[1471.16 --> 1471.46]  face
[1471.46 --> 1472.00]  and I'm thinking
[1472.00 --> 1472.82]  come on Katrina
[1472.82 --> 1473.60]  use your hands
[1473.60 --> 1473.82]  right
[1473.82 --> 1475.62]  and so I
[1475.62 --> 1476.64]  start my shift
[1476.64 --> 1477.66]  and as soon as
[1477.66 --> 1478.12]  I make that
[1478.12 --> 1478.88]  first cotton
[1478.88 --> 1479.22]  candy
[1479.22 --> 1479.68]  I'm like
[1479.68 --> 1480.20]  whoa
[1480.20 --> 1480.66]  whoa
[1480.66 --> 1481.02]  okay
[1481.02 --> 1481.54]  okay
[1481.54 --> 1483.36]  take skill
[1483.36 --> 1485.26]  my point is
[1485.26 --> 1486.32]  not for us
[1486.32 --> 1487.16]  to all be
[1487.16 --> 1489.12]  skillful cotton
[1489.12 --> 1489.92]  candy makers
[1489.92 --> 1491.32]  that's just
[1491.32 --> 1492.42]  one small way
[1492.42 --> 1493.40]  we can serve
[1493.40 --> 1494.00]  our community
[1494.00 --> 1495.96]  all the different
[1495.96 --> 1496.64]  ways where we
[1496.64 --> 1498.30]  can lend a hand
[1498.30 --> 1499.26]  pray for those
[1499.26 --> 1499.82]  in need
[1499.82 --> 1500.52]  and all the
[1500.52 --> 1501.10]  ministries that
[1501.10 --> 1501.80]  happen within
[1501.80 --> 1502.62]  our church too
[1502.62 --> 1503.68]  right
[1503.68 --> 1505.18]  with youth
[1505.18 --> 1505.94]  with Cornerstone
[1505.94 --> 1506.72]  with young adults
[1506.72 --> 1507.78]  with men's ministry
[1507.78 --> 1508.80]  with women's
[1508.80 --> 1509.20]  ministry
[1509.20 --> 1510.64]  refugee sponsorship
[1510.64 --> 1511.64]  that's coming up
[1511.64 --> 1513.50]  serving in the
[1513.50 --> 1514.24]  media booth
[1514.24 --> 1515.38]  that takes a lot
[1515.38 --> 1515.74]  of work
[1515.74 --> 1516.48]  with the sound
[1516.48 --> 1517.46]  to make all of
[1517.46 --> 1518.02]  this happen
[1518.02 --> 1519.14]  obviously on the
[1519.14 --> 1519.78]  worship team
[1519.78 --> 1520.74]  that we get to see
[1520.74 --> 1522.22]  obviously celebrating
[1522.22 --> 1523.44]  how Dave and Rhonda
[1523.44 --> 1524.36]  has been faithfully
[1524.36 --> 1525.46]  serving on our
[1525.46 --> 1526.02]  worship team
[1526.02 --> 1526.76]  and all the other
[1526.76 --> 1527.22]  areas
[1527.22 --> 1528.74]  and today sadly
[1528.74 --> 1530.02]  was the last time
[1530.02 --> 1530.82]  we saw
[1530.82 --> 1531.90]  we get to see
[1531.90 --> 1532.48]  and worship
[1532.48 --> 1532.82]  with them
[1532.82 --> 1533.44]  on stage
[1533.44 --> 1535.94]  and all the
[1535.94 --> 1536.64]  different ways
[1536.64 --> 1537.26]  that we get to
[1537.26 --> 1538.02]  serve within our
