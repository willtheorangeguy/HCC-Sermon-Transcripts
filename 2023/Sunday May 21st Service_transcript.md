[0.00 --> 11.56]  This morning we take a break from our Beatitudes series, and it's my privilege to welcome our guest pastor.
[12.12 --> 14.32]  He comes all the way from Kelowna.
[14.32 --> 21.20]  He is the UBC Okanagan campus campus minister chaplain, and so he is working.
[21.62 --> 25.34]  He has worked, and he's working as a missionary as part of our denomination.
[25.34 --> 38.80]  And him, Todd, so Pastor Todd Statham, him, and Annika and three kids live in Kelowna as they faithfully serve his kingdom to spread his kingdom there in that area through campus ministry.
[39.28 --> 46.10]  And so today I'm going to leave it up to Pastor Todd to introduce himself a little bit more and tell us how he serves God's kingdom.
[46.46 --> 49.78]  And we welcome Todd to share God's word with us this morning.
[49.96 --> 51.44]  So please welcome Pastor Todd.
[55.34 --> 61.02]  Good morning, Hope Church.
[62.38 --> 63.64]  Mike, am I coming in okay?
[63.88 --> 64.52]  You can all hear me?
[64.66 --> 64.82]  Good.
[65.62 --> 65.86]  Good.
[67.98 --> 74.46]  Well, this visit to Hope from my side is long, long overdue.
[74.46 --> 87.04]  I've been working for the Christian Reformed Church for this classist, this district, for seven years as campus pastor at the University of British Columbia's campus in the Okanagan.
[87.68 --> 91.60]  And that means I'm a missionary of your church, and you've been supporting me this whole time.
[92.16 --> 93.10]  You didn't know that, did you?
[93.10 --> 94.10]  Congratulations.
[94.10 --> 99.60]  But I'm deeply grateful for the financial support of this church.
[99.74 --> 108.02]  When your offerings get collected, some of that money eventually works to the denomination, and it pays for a number of missionaries doing different works.
[108.10 --> 113.52]  But I'm just thrilled that our church denomination supports campus ministers.
[113.52 --> 116.04]  We've got about 40 in North America.
[116.46 --> 120.32]  I'm, at the moment, the only one working in British Columbia.
[120.32 --> 124.10]  It's such a strategic mission field, working on university campuses.
[125.20 --> 136.48]  If you know anything about university life, you've heard stories, your kids, your grandkids go there, you know that it's really important that we have a gospel presence on university campuses.
[136.70 --> 147.58]  And that campus pastors like myself have an opportunity to speak into the lives of young people at this very, very formative time in their spiritual, mental, physical development.
[147.58 --> 151.30]  I also work with faculty and with international students.
[151.42 --> 162.00]  And working with faculty is a great way to bring gospel into some of the big ideas that are percolating on our university campuses that influence all of us in society.
[162.70 --> 166.08]  So I'm delighted to be a campus pastor.
[166.54 --> 171.86]  And if you want to learn more about what I do, just come and talk to me after the service.
[172.08 --> 176.86]  And I can have a chat or link you to some of the materials that I put out.
[177.58 --> 182.84]  But again, big thank you from me to you for your support over these years.
[183.10 --> 188.52]  And my apologies for taking so long to come down here to say it in person.
[190.10 --> 195.28]  But I'm here this morning not to talk about my work per se, but rather to bring you God's word.
[195.28 --> 202.36]  And on a very special Sunday, in the Christian church, we've got four big holidays.
[203.26 --> 207.92]  Christmas and Easter, Ascension, Pentecost.
[208.96 --> 213.56]  And Ascension, which is today, it kind of falls off the map, actually.
[214.42 --> 222.70]  But the very fact that we're worshiping today, how we worship, how it's received by God, it only happens because of the Ascension.
[222.70 --> 232.04]  And on Monday or Tuesday, when you go into your work and home life, all that you do in Jesus' name is happening because of the Ascension.
[232.74 --> 233.82]  So significant.
[234.42 --> 238.66]  And yet, it's a bit of an odd celebration, isn't it?
[239.46 --> 242.18]  We're celebrating someone who isn't here anymore.
[243.00 --> 244.22]  Jesus has ascended to heaven.
[244.38 --> 244.94]  He's gone.
[245.14 --> 246.32]  He's been taken from us.
[246.32 --> 253.28]  That's a little bit weird to celebrate because we often think, oh, I wish Jesus was right here with me right now in the body.
[254.54 --> 255.74]  What's going on?
[256.74 --> 264.22]  Some of those mixed feelings were present on the very first Ascension, which happened 40 days after Easter.
[264.48 --> 265.36]  Would have been Thursday.
[266.38 --> 268.42]  I'm going to read that story from the book of Acts.
[268.42 --> 272.58]  I'm reading from Acts chapter 1, verses 1 to 11.
[273.40 --> 278.10]  Hear what the Holy Spirit has to say to Hope Church this morning.
[278.10 --> 289.08]  In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day he was taken up to heaven.
[289.62 --> 295.14]  After giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he'd chosen.
[296.20 --> 302.72]  After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive.
[302.72 --> 309.22]  He appeared to them over a period of 40 days and spoke about the kingdom of God.
[310.12 --> 314.34]  On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command.
[315.08 --> 321.30]  Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my father promised, which you have heard me speak about.
[322.00 --> 328.58]  For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[329.10 --> 329.80]  It's Pentecost.
[329.80 --> 335.66]  So when they met together, they asked him, Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?
[336.22 --> 341.62]  He said to them, it's not for you to know the times or the dates the father has set up by his own authority.
[342.28 --> 346.38]  But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you.
[346.44 --> 353.66]  And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.
[353.66 --> 362.20]  After he said this, he was taken up before their eyes and a cloud hid him from their sight.
[363.46 --> 370.24]  They were looking intently up at the sky as he was going when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.
[370.72 --> 375.18]  Men of Galilee, they said, why do you stand here looking at the sky?
[375.18 --> 385.44]  Why this same Jesus who has been taken into heaven will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.
[387.10 --> 387.70]  Amen.
[388.46 --> 393.46]  May God add his blessing to the reading and to the proclamation of his holy word.
[393.46 --> 406.58]  The angels say to the disciples in verse 11, this Jesus who has been taken from you, Jesus is gone.
[408.42 --> 410.00]  He's been taken from us.
[411.84 --> 413.60]  We're supposed to celebrate this.
[413.60 --> 421.36]  It's tricky to grasp the meaning of the ascension.
[421.88 --> 422.62]  It's a mystery.
[424.04 --> 434.12]  Only when we reckon with Jesus' absence through the ascension can we really celebrate the good news,
[434.12 --> 442.38]  the great news of how Jesus is present now in our lives, also through the ascension.
[443.60 --> 445.50]  A riddle of sorts.
[446.24 --> 452.90]  I thought for a while, a long while, about how to try to get into the topic of ascension
[452.90 --> 457.78]  and how we can celebrate it, how we can find joy in this.
[458.38 --> 462.56]  And I settled on telling a story, a story that happened to me.
[462.56 --> 464.16]  And I don't often do this when I'm preaching.
[464.30 --> 466.14]  I don't often pull something out of my biography.
[466.14 --> 475.14]  But I want to tell a story of how I was filled with the joy of the presence of the ascended Christ,
[475.44 --> 480.12]  but only after my heart broke for his absence.
[480.12 --> 489.38]  I was in my early 20s, and I was invited, as a graduate student at university,
[489.38 --> 496.60]  I was invited to an academic conference in Central America for Reformed and Presbyterian educators.
[496.60 --> 504.30]  And after the conference was over, I used the chance to spend a few days with some friends
[504.30 --> 507.74]  who were working in Christian aid and development organizations,
[507.88 --> 510.72]  kind of like World Vision or World Renew.
[510.84 --> 512.20]  You know these organizations.
[512.20 --> 519.34]  I thought it would be fun to do a little bit of traveling around, but I was wrong.
[519.68 --> 520.60]  It wasn't fun at all.
[521.40 --> 523.42]  But it was life-altering.
[525.74 --> 529.38]  So one morning, I got up very early with my friend.
[529.92 --> 535.18]  She was working for an NGO, a Christian NGO that provided disaster relief.
[535.86 --> 539.22]  We got in her Jeep, and we drove out of town.
[539.22 --> 544.02]  And by the time the sun was up, we were probably 30 kilometers out of town already.
[544.52 --> 549.30]  And we turned off the highway onto this little dirt track that headed up into the hills,
[549.38 --> 551.18]  and we drove along it for several kilometers.
[551.80 --> 557.28]  And then the road ended at this hamlet, a handful of houses and a very small church.
[557.40 --> 561.54]  And there were planks of wood lying around, scrap metal.
[562.08 --> 566.36]  And some of the houses looked like holes had been punched into them,
[566.36 --> 569.98]  and old tarps were covering gaps in the sheet metal roofs.
[570.30 --> 574.18]  And my friend says as we get out of the Jeep,
[574.82 --> 577.38]  Todd, this is what an earthquake looks like.
[578.12 --> 579.42]  And I knew about this earthquake.
[579.62 --> 581.86]  It had been in the Canadian news a lot.
[581.86 --> 592.26]  This part of Central America had been afflicted by two 6.0 Richter-scale earthquakes within four weeks of each other.
[593.38 --> 596.86]  And people who were poor were now houseless.
[597.82 --> 601.56]  And there was this little evangelical Baptist church in the hamlet.
[601.90 --> 604.28]  A couple people were busy repairing it.
[604.28 --> 608.36]  There was some new concrete on the walls and a new piece of tin on the roof
[608.36 --> 612.00]  and a little hand-lettered sign in red over the door,
[612.68 --> 617.46]  Iglesia del Dios Compasivo, the Church of the Compassionate God.
[618.54 --> 621.38]  And the pastor came out to shake my hand.
[621.40 --> 622.10]  His name was Felix.
[623.00 --> 627.10]  And then with the sun rising high in the sky and the day getting hot,
[627.50 --> 632.46]  Felix and this aid worker and myself, we turned and walked into the jungle.
[632.46 --> 635.64]  Felix was the pastor of this church,
[636.14 --> 638.20]  and he wanted me to meet his flock,
[639.00 --> 641.50]  who were scattered like sheep up in the hills.
[642.74 --> 644.74]  In the very first house we came to,
[644.94 --> 649.32]  there was a middle-aged woman scratching in her garden at some peas,
[649.54 --> 653.04]  and she greeted us warmly and chatted with the aid worker.
[653.18 --> 656.34]  And I was trying my best to follow along in my high school Spanish.
[657.70 --> 662.04]  And she proudly showed me this goat that was in her yard and her little garden.
[662.04 --> 663.40]  And then with even greater pride,
[663.82 --> 666.48]  she beckoned her two kids to come out of the house to meet me.
[666.88 --> 668.86]  And the aid worker says to me in English,
[669.70 --> 672.56]  this goat and this garden were actually bought with money
[672.56 --> 674.94]  from your church denomination in Canada.
[675.74 --> 677.82]  And this is all she has to live on.
[679.14 --> 680.54]  And I was in shock.
[681.16 --> 684.40]  I was a middle-class kid in my early 20s.
[684.40 --> 690.88]  The only time I'd ever been out of Canada was to go to Disneyland.
[692.88 --> 695.00]  How could people be so poor?
[696.66 --> 697.60]  Then as we left,
[698.18 --> 699.78]  my friend says to me,
[700.18 --> 702.20]  a few years ago they found her husband
[702.20 --> 705.82]  lying face down in a field not far from here
[705.82 --> 708.24]  with a bullet in the back of his head.
[708.24 --> 710.90]  He was coming home from work one night.
[711.46 --> 714.52]  It was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
[715.42 --> 718.66]  You see, a civil war had raged through this part of the world
[718.66 --> 720.20]  in the 80s and the 90s.
[720.84 --> 722.74]  And some of the old military junta
[722.74 --> 724.58]  were still around,
[725.02 --> 726.38]  working as death squads,
[726.46 --> 728.34]  working for hire for drug cartels,
[728.66 --> 731.98]  causing trouble as this woman's husband found out.
[731.98 --> 735.70]  We walked kilometers and kilometers that day
[735.70 --> 737.42]  through the hills and the jungle.
[737.86 --> 740.70]  And to me it felt like the devil's fingerprints were everywhere.
[741.44 --> 742.62]  We'd hike through the forest
[742.62 --> 745.22]  and we'd hear the birds and screams of monkeys
[745.22 --> 746.90]  and we'd come into another clearing
[746.90 --> 748.92]  and another cluster of homes,
[749.30 --> 750.80]  another home, another story,
[751.42 --> 753.44]  hunger and of poverty
[753.44 --> 756.16]  and of great, great sorrow.
[757.66 --> 760.04]  Every family I met that day
[760.04 --> 762.88]  had a husband or a son or a brother
[762.88 --> 766.46]  who had disappeared during the Dirty War
[766.46 --> 769.02]  or a daughter who'd been violated.
[771.40 --> 772.74]  In the late afternoon,
[773.80 --> 775.84]  as the sun was beginning to set,
[776.74 --> 778.80]  we dropped into a Bible study,
[779.34 --> 781.04]  a midweek Bible study
[781.04 --> 783.26]  organized by Pastor Felix's church.
[783.90 --> 785.46]  And there were several dozen people
[785.46 --> 787.62]  crammed into this small brick building
[787.62 --> 791.10]  to pray and read scripture and to sing.
[792.28 --> 794.64]  And some of the people my age,
[794.70 --> 795.92]  some of the younger people my age,
[796.04 --> 799.12]  came up with shy smiles to greet me.
[799.74 --> 800.34]  And, you know,
[800.38 --> 800.92]  ¿Cómo se llama?
[801.12 --> 801.94]  What's your name?
[802.16 --> 804.98]  And one girl asked me in broken English,
[805.20 --> 806.56]  what's it like in Canada?
[808.56 --> 810.04]  My terrible Spanish
[810.04 --> 812.66]  saved me from having to answer her.
[812.72 --> 813.90]  I didn't want to answer her.
[813.90 --> 816.20]  What do you say?
[817.32 --> 819.50]  As we were going into the church,
[820.76 --> 821.98]  my friend, the aid worker,
[822.08 --> 822.76]  was saying to me
[822.76 --> 824.50]  that a number of the kids my age
[824.50 --> 825.36]  in their early 20s,
[825.94 --> 828.20]  they weren't in university like I was.
[828.66 --> 829.70]  They weren't in grad school.
[830.22 --> 832.00]  They worked in the sweatshop
[832.00 --> 833.28]  that we passed on the highway.
[833.96 --> 834.96]  Big brick building,
[835.30 --> 835.96]  no windows,
[836.18 --> 837.26]  wrapped in barbed wire.
[837.78 --> 838.64]  Six days a week,
[839.50 --> 840.26]  10-hour shifts,
[840.52 --> 841.20]  making T-shirts.
[841.20 --> 843.52]  And she says with some bitterness
[843.52 --> 844.20]  in her voice,
[844.32 --> 845.48]  what's a life like that worth?
[846.06 --> 847.42]  Some of these young guys
[847.42 --> 847.96]  and young girls,
[848.14 --> 850.54]  they're too busy to have a life,
[850.64 --> 851.40]  to fall in love.
[853.48 --> 854.50]  What was I going to say?
[855.08 --> 855.76]  I said nothing.
[858.72 --> 859.82]  After the Bible study,
[860.28 --> 861.56]  we drove back to the city.
[862.14 --> 863.34]  I just stared out the window.
[864.30 --> 865.48]  I felt shattered.
[866.84 --> 868.10]  Thought about all the people
[868.10 --> 868.94]  I had met that day
[868.94 --> 869.88]  and their stories
[869.88 --> 872.10]  and mothers and fathers
[872.10 --> 873.54]  whose children had disappeared
[873.54 --> 875.50]  and how food was absent
[875.50 --> 877.56]  and money was absent,
[878.22 --> 879.82]  justice was absent.
[880.02 --> 881.42]  And then this terrible thought
[881.42 --> 882.12]  came to me.
[883.60 --> 885.00]  Was God absent?
[886.94 --> 888.62]  Where was he in the hills
[888.62 --> 890.48]  amidst the devil
[890.48 --> 892.76]  and death and dust?
[893.44 --> 894.98]  Where was Jesus Christ,
[894.98 --> 897.26]  the one who rose from the dead,
[897.92 --> 898.62]  victorious,
[899.42 --> 900.10]  full of life?
[901.92 --> 903.56]  I could see only defeat.
[908.10 --> 909.14]  Men of Galilee,
[909.30 --> 910.32]  why do you stand here
[910.32 --> 911.36]  looking at the sky?
[912.52 --> 914.62]  The angels said to the disciples.
[915.68 --> 917.00]  Why do you stand here
[917.00 --> 918.06]  looking at the sky?
[919.70 --> 920.72]  Because he's gone.
[920.72 --> 923.90]  And it feels like we're alone.
[925.40 --> 926.82]  The risen Jesus
[926.82 --> 928.64]  seems absent.
[933.36 --> 935.16]  Do angels ever catch you
[935.16 --> 936.84]  staring at the sky,
[937.70 --> 939.16]  looking up,
[940.66 --> 942.14]  looking in vain?
[943.76 --> 945.08]  Where did Jesus go?
[945.08 --> 948.60]  Have you felt the absence
[948.60 --> 949.64]  of God in your heart?
[951.36 --> 952.92]  Maybe it's a crisis you're in
[952.92 --> 955.06]  or a disaster.
[955.22 --> 955.70]  You feel like you're
[955.70 --> 956.70]  in the bottom of a pit,
[957.64 --> 958.04]  alone.
[958.66 --> 959.46]  Maybe you're dying.
[960.86 --> 961.76]  Maybe you're terribly,
[961.96 --> 962.68]  terribly afraid.
[964.28 --> 965.92]  Maybe it's months of tedium
[965.92 --> 967.68]  stretching into years
[967.68 --> 970.22]  where good cheer and joy
[970.22 --> 971.08]  just get stifled
[971.64 --> 972.84]  by routine.
[972.84 --> 974.50]  Where is our risen Lord?
[975.08 --> 977.66]  Here we are,
[978.32 --> 979.56]  standing stock still,
[980.50 --> 981.96]  looking up into the sky
[981.96 --> 983.30]  for the one who is gone.
[984.28 --> 985.54]  Where is Jesus?
[988.62 --> 989.66]  Some of you have asked
[989.66 --> 990.18]  that question.
[991.10 --> 992.18]  If you haven't,
[992.44 --> 993.28]  you probably will.
[995.10 --> 996.60]  We all know that feeling,
[996.92 --> 997.40]  I think,
[998.06 --> 999.18]  of absence.
[999.18 --> 999.30]  Absence.
[999.30 --> 999.38]  Absence.
[1005.08 --> 1009.92]  A few days after that visit
[1009.92 --> 1010.52]  into the hills,
[1011.16 --> 1013.18]  I had the day off.
[1013.80 --> 1014.64]  My friend was busy.
[1015.14 --> 1016.32]  So I played the tourist
[1016.32 --> 1017.58]  in the little town.
[1018.00 --> 1019.52]  I wandered into the town plaza.
[1020.24 --> 1021.06]  It was getting hot
[1021.06 --> 1022.80]  and I was getting crispy.
[1022.80 --> 1024.46]  So I took refuge
[1024.46 --> 1025.92]  in the cool shadows
[1025.92 --> 1028.88]  of this small Catholic church
[1028.88 --> 1030.20]  that, like in many
[1030.20 --> 1031.44]  Central American towns,
[1031.92 --> 1032.98]  has its door open
[1032.98 --> 1034.42]  to the town plaza.
[1036.30 --> 1037.88]  I walked into this little church.
[1038.16 --> 1039.70]  My eyes adjusted to the light
[1039.70 --> 1040.84]  and at the very back
[1040.84 --> 1041.40]  of the church
[1041.40 --> 1042.14]  is the altar.
[1042.68 --> 1043.42]  And over the altar
[1043.42 --> 1044.22]  was a painting,
[1045.22 --> 1047.18]  technically called a triptych.
[1048.18 --> 1049.78]  And this was a remarkable triptych.
[1050.12 --> 1051.22]  This painting was remarkable.
[1051.44 --> 1052.18]  Not because it was
[1052.18 --> 1053.42]  a wonderful piece of art.
[1053.58 --> 1054.52]  It wasn't.
[1054.92 --> 1055.98]  It was very basic.
[1056.80 --> 1057.96]  Its colors were fading.
[1058.68 --> 1059.92]  But it felt like a sign
[1059.92 --> 1061.82]  from God to me.
[1062.96 --> 1063.70]  This hasn't happened
[1063.70 --> 1064.94]  very often in my life.
[1065.76 --> 1066.34]  It was a painting
[1066.34 --> 1067.08]  of the ascension
[1067.08 --> 1067.98]  of Jesus Christ.
[1069.48 --> 1070.98]  Jesus Christ was ascending
[1071.60 --> 1072.78]  into heaven
[1072.78 --> 1073.78]  and the whole world
[1073.78 --> 1075.20]  was painted below him.
[1075.20 --> 1077.24]  He's ascending
[1077.24 --> 1079.08]  as the risen Lord
[1079.08 --> 1079.66]  in glory
[1079.66 --> 1083.00]  and as the crucified one.
[1084.12 --> 1085.58]  His upper body was naked.
[1086.42 --> 1087.60]  His ribs were showing.
[1088.62 --> 1089.98]  And he had a king's crown
[1089.98 --> 1090.62]  on his head
[1090.62 --> 1091.70]  but it was painted
[1091.70 --> 1092.46]  as if it was made
[1092.46 --> 1093.34]  out of barbed wire.
[1094.28 --> 1095.56]  The same kind of barbed wire
[1095.56 --> 1097.06]  that had incarcerated
[1097.06 --> 1098.24]  tens of thousands
[1098.24 --> 1099.00]  in the war.
[1100.28 --> 1101.60]  And the hands of God,
[1101.80 --> 1102.56]  the Son of God,
[1102.76 --> 1104.00]  stretched out in authority
[1104.00 --> 1104.60]  and love
[1104.60 --> 1105.86]  over all of creation
[1105.86 --> 1107.18]  were scarred
[1107.18 --> 1109.26]  from nails.
[1110.16 --> 1111.76]  I stared at this painting
[1111.76 --> 1112.82]  over the altar.
[1113.44 --> 1114.34]  This ascended Christ
[1114.34 --> 1114.98]  high
[1114.98 --> 1116.74]  over this broken,
[1117.04 --> 1117.88]  bleeding world.
[1118.48 --> 1120.08]  Christ exalted in glory
[1120.08 --> 1120.68]  and yet
[1120.68 --> 1121.98]  so,
[1122.36 --> 1123.74]  so human.
[1124.88 --> 1125.78]  So much like
[1125.78 --> 1127.36]  the suffering people
[1127.36 --> 1128.82]  I'd come across
[1128.82 --> 1129.42]  that day
[1129.42 --> 1130.50]  over and over again.
[1130.50 --> 1131.68]  So much like us.
[1134.68 --> 1136.22]  This is what is remarkable
[1136.22 --> 1138.66]  about the ascension.
[1139.38 --> 1140.28]  Earlier we sang
[1140.28 --> 1141.76]  of this marvelous mystery.
[1142.10 --> 1143.68]  This is a marvelous mystery here.
[1145.12 --> 1145.88]  This Jesus
[1145.88 --> 1147.62]  who has been taken from you
[1147.62 --> 1149.86]  is taken up to heaven
[1149.86 --> 1151.14]  with a body.
[1151.14 --> 1153.72]  The same body
[1153.72 --> 1155.52]  that walked roads
[1155.52 --> 1156.68]  until his feet
[1156.68 --> 1157.26]  were weary.
[1158.02 --> 1159.24]  The same body
[1159.24 --> 1159.90]  that hungered
[1159.90 --> 1160.96]  and thirsted.
[1161.60 --> 1162.60]  The same body
[1162.60 --> 1163.46]  that was beaten
[1163.46 --> 1165.06]  and bloodied.
[1165.64 --> 1166.68]  The same body
[1166.68 --> 1167.74]  that was forsaken.
[1168.44 --> 1169.26]  The same body
[1169.26 --> 1169.98]  as yours
[1169.98 --> 1170.80]  and mine
[1170.80 --> 1171.80]  except for sin
[1171.80 --> 1173.00]  is sitting
[1173.00 --> 1174.84]  on heaven's mercy seat
[1174.84 --> 1176.68]  and is interceding
[1176.68 --> 1177.28]  for us.
[1177.28 --> 1179.56]  And this is the mystery.
[1180.94 --> 1181.82]  In the power
[1181.82 --> 1182.84]  of the Holy Spirit
[1182.84 --> 1183.98]  that Jesus
[1183.98 --> 1185.26]  the God-man
[1185.26 --> 1187.04]  is as near to us
[1187.04 --> 1188.34]  as the very air we breathe.
[1191.32 --> 1192.00]  One of our
[1192.00 --> 1192.88]  confessional standards
[1192.88 --> 1193.96]  in the Christian Reformed Church
[1193.96 --> 1195.00]  the Heidelberg Catechism
[1195.00 --> 1195.84]  puts it like this.
[1196.08 --> 1196.60]  Bring it up
[1196.60 --> 1197.46]  on the screen.
[1198.92 --> 1200.10]  They asked the question
[1200.10 --> 1201.22]  500 years ago
[1201.22 --> 1202.12]  to people
[1202.12 --> 1203.68]  who felt alone
[1203.68 --> 1204.42]  and anxious
[1204.42 --> 1205.30]  and worried
[1205.30 --> 1205.94]  and wondering
[1205.94 --> 1207.24]  isn't Jesus
[1207.24 --> 1208.12]  Christ with us
[1208.12 --> 1209.06]  until the end
[1209.06 --> 1210.08]  of the world
[1210.08 --> 1210.96]  as He promised?
[1211.90 --> 1212.80]  Because we can't
[1212.80 --> 1213.88]  see Him anymore, right?
[1214.84 --> 1215.52]  And the answer
[1215.52 --> 1217.30]  Christ is true human
[1217.30 --> 1218.30]  and true God.
[1218.82 --> 1219.86]  In His human nature
[1219.86 --> 1220.92]  Christ is now
[1220.92 --> 1222.00]  not on earth
[1222.00 --> 1223.86]  but in His divinity
[1223.86 --> 1225.20]  His majesty
[1225.20 --> 1226.02]  grace
[1226.02 --> 1226.86]  and spirit
[1226.86 --> 1227.98]  He's never
[1227.98 --> 1229.74]  absent from us.
[1230.96 --> 1231.34]  And if I can
[1231.34 --> 1232.10]  translate this
[1232.10 --> 1232.68]  into kind of
[1232.68 --> 1234.04]  modern English
[1234.04 --> 1235.06]  or a more
[1235.06 --> 1235.98]  simplified thought
[1235.98 --> 1237.04]  the ascension
[1237.04 --> 1237.82]  means we've got
[1237.82 --> 1238.58]  the best
[1238.58 --> 1240.54]  of both worlds.
[1241.54 --> 1242.86]  Jesus Christ
[1242.86 --> 1243.74]  as man
[1243.74 --> 1245.00]  is on heaven's
[1245.00 --> 1245.68]  mercy seat
[1245.68 --> 1247.08]  and He knows
[1247.08 --> 1247.98]  exactly what
[1247.98 --> 1248.92]  we're going through
[1248.92 --> 1250.14]  what we're struggling
[1250.14 --> 1250.54]  with
[1250.54 --> 1251.92]  because He shares
[1251.92 --> 1252.58]  our body
[1252.58 --> 1253.80]  our flesh
[1253.80 --> 1255.12]  and all its frailties
[1255.12 --> 1257.34]  and He's God.
[1260.68 --> 1261.84]  What this means
[1261.84 --> 1264.08]  whatever you're
[1264.08 --> 1264.74]  struggling with
[1264.74 --> 1265.88]  whatever circumstances
[1265.88 --> 1266.66]  or crisis
[1266.66 --> 1267.62]  you're in
[1267.62 --> 1268.58]  whatever we are
[1268.58 --> 1269.48]  tempted with
[1269.48 --> 1270.96]  however much sorrow
[1270.96 --> 1271.88]  is in my heart
[1271.88 --> 1272.56]  right now
[1272.56 --> 1273.42]  the ascended
[1273.42 --> 1274.36]  Christ knows
[1274.36 --> 1275.86]  exactly
[1275.86 --> 1277.16]  what we're going
[1277.16 --> 1277.46]  through
[1277.46 --> 1279.06]  because that same
[1279.06 --> 1279.92]  body lived on our
[1279.92 --> 1280.36]  streets
[1280.36 --> 1281.26]  and He knows
[1281.26 --> 1281.82]  our struggles
[1281.82 --> 1282.96]  and He's
[1282.96 --> 1283.58]  ascended
[1283.58 --> 1284.34]  to heaven
[1284.34 --> 1285.30]  and in the Spirit
[1285.30 --> 1287.26]  He is right here
[1287.26 --> 1288.98]  right here
[1288.98 --> 1290.96]  and as I reflected
[1290.96 --> 1291.60]  on this
[1291.60 --> 1292.70]  my mind was
[1292.70 --> 1293.60]  working overtime
[1293.60 --> 1294.28]  as I'm sitting
[1294.28 --> 1295.12]  in this little church
[1295.12 --> 1296.76]  began to dawn on me
[1296.76 --> 1297.66]  as I thought back
[1297.66 --> 1298.74]  on the previous day
[1298.74 --> 1299.78]  that all these
[1299.78 --> 1300.72]  struggling Christians
[1300.72 --> 1301.56]  I'd met
[1301.56 --> 1302.98]  for them
[1302.98 --> 1303.66]  the ascended
[1303.66 --> 1304.10]  Jesus
[1304.10 --> 1306.98]  was so close
[1306.98 --> 1308.74]  as the man
[1308.74 --> 1309.56]  of sorrows
[1309.56 --> 1310.68]  and
[1310.68 --> 1312.96]  as almighty
[1312.96 --> 1313.50]  God
[1313.50 --> 1315.08]  Jesus
[1315.08 --> 1316.36]  absent in the body
[1316.36 --> 1317.84]  but present
[1317.84 --> 1318.60]  in the Spirit
[1318.60 --> 1319.72]  in fact
[1319.72 --> 1320.38]  so many
[1320.38 --> 1321.10]  of the people
[1321.10 --> 1321.90]  I met that day
[1321.90 --> 1322.92]  were living
[1322.92 --> 1324.20]  with great joy
[1324.20 --> 1325.86]  in the presence
[1325.86 --> 1326.70]  of Christ
[1326.70 --> 1327.92]  despite terrible
[1327.92 --> 1328.82]  circumstances
[1328.82 --> 1331.04]  like this one
[1331.04 --> 1331.42]  old lady
[1331.42 --> 1332.12]  that we visited
[1332.12 --> 1333.78]  she was all alone
[1333.78 --> 1335.76]  her sons
[1335.76 --> 1336.64]  two sons
[1336.64 --> 1337.26]  and her husband
[1337.26 --> 1338.88]  had both been killed
[1338.88 --> 1340.04]  by paramilitaries
[1340.04 --> 1340.54]  in the war
[1340.54 --> 1342.90]  when we walked up
[1342.90 --> 1343.62]  into her house
[1343.62 --> 1344.36]  she came out
[1344.36 --> 1345.24]  and she greeted me
[1345.24 --> 1346.06]  with a smile
[1346.06 --> 1346.88]  and a hug
[1346.88 --> 1348.42]  not how we normally
[1348.42 --> 1349.44]  greet strangers
[1349.44 --> 1350.38]  total strangers
[1350.38 --> 1350.96]  in Canada
[1350.96 --> 1352.94]  she made a glass
[1352.94 --> 1353.82]  of orange juice
[1353.82 --> 1354.28]  for me
[1354.28 --> 1355.84]  from this little
[1355.84 --> 1356.40]  orange tree
[1356.40 --> 1356.82]  in her yard
[1356.82 --> 1357.56]  and she mixed it
[1357.56 --> 1358.30]  with rain water
[1358.30 --> 1359.16]  from her barrel
[1359.16 --> 1360.96]  the next day
[1360.96 --> 1362.26]  I had the worst
[1362.26 --> 1362.92]  diarrhea
[1362.92 --> 1363.66]  the next day
[1363.66 --> 1364.08]  that I
[1364.08 --> 1366.76]  but as I left
[1366.76 --> 1367.62]  as I left her
[1367.62 --> 1368.52]  she's this little
[1368.52 --> 1369.38]  shriveled old lady
[1369.38 --> 1370.72]  she comes right up
[1370.72 --> 1371.00]  to me
[1371.00 --> 1371.70]  and she looks me
[1371.70 --> 1372.42]  right in the eye
[1372.42 --> 1373.58]  as my equal
[1373.58 --> 1375.58]  and she puts her
[1375.58 --> 1376.40]  hand on my head
[1376.40 --> 1378.06]  and she blesses me
[1378.06 --> 1379.78]  in the name
[1379.78 --> 1380.62]  of Jesus Christ
[1380.62 --> 1382.70]  one of the
[1382.70 --> 1383.72]  holy moments
[1383.72 --> 1384.44]  of my life
[1384.44 --> 1385.88]  she should have
[1385.88 --> 1386.44]  been crushed
[1386.44 --> 1388.16]  she should have
[1388.16 --> 1388.66]  been broken
[1388.66 --> 1389.82]  on the wheel
[1389.82 --> 1390.38]  of history
[1390.38 --> 1392.24]  but she wasn't
[1392.24 --> 1393.92]  she should have
[1393.92 --> 1394.32]  been crushed
[1394.32 --> 1394.96]  by poverty
[1394.96 --> 1395.54]  and war
[1395.54 --> 1396.48]  and all that
[1396.48 --> 1397.04]  she endured
[1397.04 --> 1399.52]  how not
[1399.52 --> 1402.36]  and Pastor Felix
[1402.36 --> 1403.46]  how could he
[1403.46 --> 1404.02]  have the energy
[1404.02 --> 1405.44]  to tend to this
[1405.44 --> 1406.06]  little flock
[1406.06 --> 1407.16]  lost in the jungle
[1407.16 --> 1408.74]  and all those
[1408.74 --> 1409.48]  young girls
[1409.48 --> 1409.94]  and boys
[1409.94 --> 1410.60]  my age
[1410.60 --> 1412.28]  who worked
[1412.28 --> 1413.04]  in sweatshops
[1413.04 --> 1414.22]  when I thought
[1414.22 --> 1414.74]  back on them
[1414.74 --> 1415.38]  during the Bible
[1415.38 --> 1415.66]  study
[1415.66 --> 1416.40]  their hands
[1416.40 --> 1416.92]  were raised
[1416.92 --> 1417.42]  in worship
[1417.42 --> 1418.62]  their hearts
[1418.62 --> 1419.30]  were as free
[1419.30 --> 1419.88]  as mine
[1419.88 --> 1421.12]  they were full
[1421.12 --> 1421.62]  of joy
[1421.62 --> 1422.56]  and happiness
[1422.56 --> 1422.94]  too
[1422.94 --> 1424.76]  why?
[1426.40 --> 1427.44]  because of the
[1427.44 --> 1427.98]  ascension
[1427.98 --> 1430.24]  when waves
[1430.24 --> 1430.80]  break
[1430.80 --> 1431.98]  over us
[1431.98 --> 1433.52]  the ascended
[1433.52 --> 1434.04]  Christ

[2007.04 --> 2007.26]  to
