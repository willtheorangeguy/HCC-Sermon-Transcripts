[0.00 → 4.64] Good morning.
[6.50 → 10.62] It's good to be with you again this morning.
[12.40 → 15.18] A special welcome to those who are visiting.
[16.40 → 18.72] You've come on part four of the series,
[18.94 → 22.18] so I'll try to keep you filled in if this is new to you.
[22.56 → 24.44] We've done a series on the book of Ruth,
[25.34 → 26.70] the Old Testament book of Ruth,
[26.70 → 28.12] and I'm going to conclude it today
[28.12 → 30.76] and hopefully tie it all together neatly in a bow.
[30.90 → 32.16] So that's the plan here.
[33.48 → 35.18] When I think of the Word of God,
[36.10 → 39.06] and we picture it like a journey,
[40.02 → 43.48] from the beginning of time to the end of time in essence,
[44.32 → 49.30] the story of God, I picture not a straight highway through the prairies,
[49.96 → 55.50] but rather a curvy adventure through all kinds of terrain
[55.50 → 58.34] and there's smooth sailing and there's rough roads
[58.34 → 59.58] and there's everything in between.
[61.26 → 63.72] And then there are signs along the way,
[64.72 → 66.46] and the sign says,
[67.10 → 68.16] the best is yet to come.
[69.80 → 71.82] So it is with the book of Ruth.
[71.82 → 74.20] In the book of Ruth,
[74.34 → 78.92] we see God's plan unfolding through the ordinary details of life.
[80.34 → 81.76] In the beginning we have a family.
[82.32 → 83.06] There's a famine.
[83.72 → 86.60] The family takes off to try to live elsewhere
[86.60 → 89.48] so they can survive the time of famine.
[90.54 → 92.02] While they're living elsewhere,
[92.48 → 93.70] there's death in the family,
[94.32 → 95.76] loss of loved ones.
[96.66 → 98.88] Then there are these widows trying to survive.
[98.88 → 102.04] There's the devotion of this wonderful daughter-in-law.
[102.32 → 105.38] There's the integrity of this man who comes to the rescue.
[106.06 → 107.54] There's all this ordinary life.
[107.88 → 112.16] And in it all, God is somehow at work.
[113.54 → 118.52] And the people in the story have no idea of all that's going on.
[119.58 → 120.68] But God does.
[120.68 → 124.68] The story has all kinds of troubles.
[125.24 → 129.10] Famine, death, barrenness, living without a home,
[129.64 → 132.24] coming to a new country, coming as a foreigner.
[132.42 → 134.96] All that's going on in this story.
[136.12 → 137.86] And one of the main characters, Naomi,
[138.98 → 144.20] who went to the land of Moab with her sons and her husband,
[144.54 → 145.80] well, she said,
[145.94 → 147.62] I went away full, right?
[147.66 → 148.66] Everything was going okay.
[148.66 → 151.30] And then her husband dies,
[151.36 → 152.30] and her two sons die,
[152.40 → 153.52] and she has these daughters-in-law.
[154.16 → 155.06] But she says,
[155.22 → 156.14] and she comes back,
[156.20 → 156.44] and she says,
[156.48 → 157.26] I went away full,
[157.64 → 160.82] but God has brought me back empty.
[162.96 → 163.44] Empty.
[164.72 → 165.52] She's hurting.
[167.14 → 168.28] But in the story,
[168.36 → 169.06] as it goes on,
[169.12 → 169.68] we begin,
[169.88 → 171.10] so it seems so hopeless,
[171.40 → 173.52] but we begin to see hope dawning.
[173.52 → 175.36] And there's this guy named Boaz,
[175.44 → 177.20] and he helps them find some food,
[177.62 → 178.04] and he's,
[178.28 → 179.04] we find out,
[179.12 → 181.16] is a potential match,
[181.48 → 183.10] what the story calls,
[183.20 → 185.08] a kinsman redeemer.
[185.68 → 186.60] So he's in the
[186.66 → 190.52] sort of in the same family line of Naomi,
[190.90 → 192.98] and so then he can help them out
[192.98 → 195.18] as a kinsman redeemer.
[195.18 → 196.42] Now,
[197.68 → 198.98] what we're looking for
[198.98 → 201.00] is marriage.
[201.56 → 202.64] There's this young woman,
[202.86 → 203.12] Ruth,
[203.18 → 203.76] who's widowed,
[204.04 → 205.76] and there's this older bachelor
[205.76 → 207.44] named Boaz.
[207.70 → 209.72] But Boaz doesn't seem to
[209.72 → 212.00] get the proposal thing going,
[212.70 → 214.30] as we saw last week.
[214.60 → 215.76] My wife Candy says,
[216.10 → 217.98] she really pictures an older bachelor
[217.98 → 220.08] who really needs a push.
[221.72 → 223.64] And I suppose there's part truth to that.
[224.34 → 225.18] And we live,
[225.34 → 227.28] as the people reading the story,
[227.36 → 228.86] we live with a certain sense of uncertainty,
[229.00 → 230.36] at least from a human point of view.
[230.94 → 232.50] And then we come to chapter three,
[232.70 → 234.48] which Jonathan preached so well on last week.
[235.02 → 236.78] And a little aside,
[237.64 → 239.36] Pastor Dave and I were wondering
[239.36 → 241.10] how this rookie pastor
[241.10 → 244.36] would handle this kind of steamy love story.
[245.08 → 247.62] And we were hoping he'd squirm a little bit.
[247.62 → 248.10] So,
[248.38 → 250.62] we're going to get him to do the whole series
[250.62 → 251.94] on the Song of Songs next.
[252.26 → 257.06] But it is a real human story, right?
[257.26 → 260.00] And there is some sexual tension in that story.
[260.36 → 261.92] And there's this story of loyalty
[261.92 → 263.18] and honesty, integrity.
[263.78 → 264.48] And Naomi,
[265.08 → 265.34] you know,
[265.40 → 267.70] kind of takes charge of the scene a little bit.
[267.92 → 269.02] She pushes Ruth
[269.02 → 272.74] to get this marriage proposal underway.
[274.28 → 275.22] And then we're,
[275.40 → 275.80] as readers,
[275.80 → 277.80] are so happy to see this story unfolding.
[278.84 → 279.98] And we begin to see that,
[280.08 → 280.18] hey,
[280.28 → 284.12] Boaz is actually warming up to this idea of marriage.
[285.56 → 288.16] But then we come to this other setback.
[289.12 → 289.42] There's,
[289.56 → 290.40] in this society,
[290.52 → 291.80] there are these kinsmen redeemers,
[292.62 → 294.72] people who are in the family line
[294.72 → 297.38] who have a legitimate right to help out.
[297.38 → 298.26] And so,
[298.26 → 300.28] Boaz is number two.
[300.42 → 302.32] There's a guy ahead of him
[302.32 → 304.88] who could take Abimelech's property
[304.88 → 306.34] and Ruth,
[306.44 → 307.24] if he so chooses.
[307.54 → 308.38] And once again,
[308.48 → 309.28] a man of integrity,
[309.72 → 310.62] Boaz says,
[310.74 → 310.90] okay,
[311.36 → 312.78] this guy's first,
[312.90 → 313.44] so he has to,
[313.52 → 315.06] he has to think about it first.
[315.46 → 317.92] But now he is a man on a mission.
[318.36 → 319.84] And now we come to chapter four.
[320.22 → 320.58] So let's,
[320.62 → 321.58] let's read it together.
[321.82 → 322.02] Okay,
[322.02 → 322.76] it's a little bit long,
[323.12 → 324.68] but it's a pretty interesting story.
[324.84 → 325.66] At least I think so.
[326.52 → 326.80] All right.
[326.90 → 327.46] So meanwhile,
[328.74 → 329.30] meanwhile,
[329.46 → 331.42] Boaz went up to the town gate.
[331.54 → 332.04] Town gate,
[332.40 → 333.88] this is where the leaders gather.
[334.42 → 335.22] And sat down there
[335.22 → 338.24] just as the first guardian redeemer
[338.24 → 340.86] he had mentioned comes along.
[341.20 → 341.76] And Boaz said,
[341.84 → 341.96] hey,
[342.04 → 342.54] come over here,
[342.58 → 342.94] my friend,
[343.02 → 343.38] sit down.
[343.58 → 345.08] So he went over and he sat down.
[345.56 → 348.30] Then Boaz took ten of the elders of the town,
[348.38 → 348.84] so the leaders,
[348.96 → 349.24] and said,
[349.44 → 349.98] sit here.
[350.14 → 350.86] And they did so,
[350.86 → 351.74] so something's happening.
[352.46 → 354.18] And then he said to this guardian redeemer,
[354.68 → 355.34] Naomi,
[355.84 → 356.76] you know who she is,
[357.30 → 358.54] who came back from Moab,
[358.62 → 359.62] is selling the piece of land
[359.62 → 361.26] that belonged to our relative Abimelech.
[361.56 → 363.28] I thought I should bring the matter
[363.28 → 364.06] to your attention
[364.06 → 365.54] and suggest you bide
[365.54 → 367.22] in the presence of these seated here
[367.22 → 368.34] and in the presence
[368.34 → 370.36] of the elders of my people.
[370.70 → 371.66] If you will,
[371.86 → 372.50] redeem it,
[372.56 → 372.90] do so.
[373.54 → 374.30] But if you will not,
[374.38 → 374.72] tell me,
[374.78 → 375.50] so I will know.
[376.42 → 378.02] For no one has the right to do it
[378.02 → 378.54] except you,
[378.60 → 379.86] and I'm next in line.
[379.86 → 382.18] I'll redeem it,
[382.42 → 382.90] he said.
[384.04 → 385.42] And all of us at this point
[385.42 → 385.74] are going,
[385.92 → 386.68] no, no, no, no,
[386.80 → 387.24] don't.
[387.74 → 389.00] We want Boaz, right?
[389.02 → 390.26] That's kind of what we're supposed to feel here.
[390.74 → 391.22] I redeem it.
[391.24 → 391.94] And then Boaz said,
[392.02 → 392.30] okay,
[392.42 → 392.98] on the day,
[393.16 → 393.40] yeah,
[393.44 → 393.88] there's fine,
[394.08 → 395.88] on the day you buy the land from Naomi,
[396.30 → 397.92] you also acquire
[397.92 → 399.46] Ruth,
[401.00 → 402.12] the Mobile,
[402.12 → 403.58] all right,
[403.64 → 405.08] so you see it's a bit loaded here,
[405.60 → 407.18] and the dead man's widow
[407.18 → 408.70] in order to maintain
[408.70 → 409.66] the name of the dead
[409.66 → 410.76] with his property.
[410.94 → 412.20] You see this cultural stuff
[412.20 → 412.62] going on here.
[413.02 → 413.66] And at this,
[414.04 → 415.14] the guardian redeemer said,
[415.62 → 418.00] then I cannot redeem it
[418.00 → 419.36] because I might endanger
[419.36 → 420.18] my own estate.
[420.40 → 421.34] And we're not sure
[421.34 → 422.52] what he means by that.
[423.02 → 424.04] I'm kind of implying
[424.04 → 425.12] that maybe he had a problem
[425.12 → 426.14] with the Mobile thing.
[426.60 → 427.80] Other writers say,
[427.80 → 428.28] well, you know,
[428.32 → 429.26] he was already married.
[429.88 → 430.06] Anyway,
[430.18 → 431.14] whatever the reason,
[431.36 → 431.86] he says,
[431.86 → 433.42] you redeem it yourself,
[433.52 → 434.24] I cannot do it.
[434.80 → 435.42] And now we get a little
[435.42 → 436.04] on the side here.
[436.40 → 437.90] Now in earlier times in Israel,
[438.46 → 439.20] for the redemption
[439.20 → 440.48] and transfer of property
[440.48 → 441.48] become final,
[442.12 → 444.08] one party took off his sandal
[444.08 → 445.08] and gave it to another.
[446.38 → 447.62] A lot of foot stuff
[447.62 → 448.58] going on in this story,
[448.62 → 448.94] isn't there?
[449.44 → 449.88] Anyway,
[450.70 → 451.78] this was the method
[451.78 → 453.28] of legalizing transactions
[453.28 → 454.10] in Israel.
[454.62 → 455.84] So the guardian redeemer
[455.84 → 456.68] said to Boaz,
[456.78 → 457.74] buy it yourself.
[457.88 → 458.90] And he removed the sandal.
[459.32 → 460.24] And then Boaz announced
[460.24 → 460.72] to the elders
[460.72 → 461.24] and all the people,
[461.24 → 461.44] well,
[461.44 → 462.46] today you're my witnesses
[462.46 → 463.88] that I have bought
[463.88 → 464.58] from Naomi
[464.58 → 465.64] all the property
[465.64 → 466.26] of Abimelech,
[466.70 → 467.10] Ilion,
[467.56 → 468.00] and Mason.
[468.08 → 468.72] Those are the sons.
[469.20 → 470.28] I have also acquired
[470.28 → 471.74] Ruth the Mobile,
[472.06 → 472.78] Mason's wife,
[473.26 → 473.48] widow,
[473.62 → 474.32] as my wife,
[474.44 → 475.36] in order to maintain
[475.36 → 476.18] the name of the dead
[476.18 → 476.84] with his property
[476.84 → 477.92] so that his name
[477.92 → 478.64] will not disappear
[478.64 → 480.32] from among his family
[480.32 → 482.34] or from his hometown.
[483.62 → 485.08] Today you are my witnesses.
[485.08 → 486.48] And then the elders
[486.48 → 487.24] and all the people
[487.24 → 487.92] at the gate said,
[488.06 → 488.88] we are witnesses.
[489.36 → 489.84] May the Lord
[489.84 → 490.74] make this woman
[490.74 → 491.70] who is coming
[491.70 → 492.32] into your home
[492.32 → 493.90] like Rachel and Leah.
[494.00 → 494.48] Now some of you
[494.48 → 495.02] are going to be saying,
[495.14 → 496.74] who are they?
[497.50 → 497.76] Right?
[497.96 → 498.36] Fair enough.
[498.48 → 499.04] We're going to talk
[499.04 → 499.64] about that in a moment.
[500.04 → 500.94] Like Rachel and Leah,
[501.24 → 502.22] who together built up
[502.22 → 504.70] the family of Israel.
[504.96 → 505.70] May you have standing
[505.70 → 506.88] in Ephrata,
[506.96 → 507.64] one of the tribes,
[507.78 → 508.70] and be famous
[508.70 → 509.50] in Bethlehem.
[509.94 → 510.92] Bethlehem should ring
[510.92 → 511.74] a bell here.
[512.06 → 512.16] Right?
[512.32 → 513.00] Okay, we're coming
[513.00 → 513.72] to the Christmas season.
[514.40 → 515.70] Through the offspring
[515.70 → 517.08] of the Lord gives you
[517.08 → 518.44] by this young woman,
[518.74 → 519.36] may your family
[519.36 → 520.70] be like that of Perez.
[521.00 → 521.64] You say, who's that?
[521.72 → 522.18] Yeah, we'll talk
[522.18 → 522.68] about that in a minute.
[523.00 → 524.70] Whom Tamar bore to Judah.
[524.86 → 525.60] Okay, all right.
[525.66 → 526.42] So there's stuff here.
[526.92 → 528.14] So Boaz took Ruth
[528.14 → 529.64] and she became his wife.
[530.18 → 531.46] When he made love to her,
[532.34 → 533.96] the Lord enabled her
[533.96 → 534.50] to conceive
[534.50 → 535.78] and she gave birth
[535.78 → 536.24] to a son.
[537.44 → 538.50] And the women said to Naomi,
[538.50 → 539.86] Naomi, praise be to the Lord
[539.86 → 540.72] who this day
[540.72 → 541.66] has not left you
[541.66 → 542.80] without a guardian redeemer.
[543.22 → 544.26] May he become famous
[544.26 → 544.88] throughout Israel.
[545.82 → 547.04] He will renew your life
[547.04 → 547.78] and sustain you
[547.78 → 548.46] in your old age
[548.46 → 549.78] for your daughter-in-law
[549.78 → 550.70] who loves you
[550.70 → 551.84] and who is better to you
[551.84 → 553.04] than seven sons
[553.04 → 554.74] has given him birth.
[555.66 → 556.74] Then Naomi took the child
[556.74 → 557.16] in her arms
[557.16 → 557.98] and cared for him.
[558.64 → 559.36] The women living there
[559.36 → 561.00] said, Naomi has a son.
[561.82 → 563.02] And they named him Bed.
[563.82 → 564.70] You might say, who's that?
[565.06 → 565.86] Father of Jesse.
[565.98 → 566.46] Who's that?
[566.82 → 567.76] Father of David.
[567.76 → 569.14] Oh, all right.
[569.22 → 570.46] That should get us going here.
[571.00 → 572.16] And then he jumps right
[572.16 → 574.32] into this little genealogy here.
[574.82 → 575.52] This then
[575.52 → 577.40] is the family line
[577.40 → 578.26] of Perez.
[579.18 → 579.54] Okay.
[580.00 → 581.08] Who's the father of Hebron?
[581.34 → 581.60] Okay.
[581.86 → 582.80] Hebron, the father of Ram.
[582.88 → 584.74] Ram, the father of Amminadab.
[584.80 → 587.02] Amminadab, the father of Nasion.
[587.12 → 588.18] Nasion, the father of Simon.
[588.52 → 589.74] Simon, the father of Boaz.
[589.86 → 590.14] Oh, okay.
[590.22 → 591.34] We understand what Boaz is.
[591.58 → 592.78] Boaz, the father of Bed.
[593.04 → 593.98] Bed, the father of Jesse.
[594.46 → 595.38] Jesse, the father of...
[595.38 → 595.94] Oh, here we go.
[595.94 → 596.42] David.
[596.56 → 597.00] There we go.
[598.36 → 598.64] All right.
[598.72 → 600.74] So now there's this big story
[600.74 → 602.50] going on with this.
[604.08 → 606.10] Finally, Ruth and Boaz
[606.10 → 607.44] can start their life together.
[607.70 → 609.04] And they have this child.
[609.14 → 609.80] And we might say,
[609.94 → 610.66] and we could end here,
[610.92 → 612.60] they lived happily ever after.
[615.18 → 616.50] And it's kind of true
[616.50 → 618.78] because we get this genealogy thing
[618.78 → 619.24] going here.
[619.24 → 621.96] And there is a whole ever after
[621.96 → 623.46] because the line of David
[623.46 → 624.52] was supposed to last forever.
[624.62 → 625.86] So there is a happily ever,
[626.02 → 627.94] but not maybe exactly the way we think.
[628.48 → 629.46] We want that though.
[629.62 → 631.74] We want this to be kind of like the dot-com.
[631.86 → 634.12] We want this just to work out well.
[635.22 → 637.76] But again, there is so much more going on here.
[639.76 → 641.24] Now, let's back up a minute.
[641.24 → 644.42] Remember, Ruth didn't come to Israel
[644.42 → 647.32] with any children from her first marriage,
[647.40 → 648.80] which was 10 years long.
[650.32 → 652.42] So when we're reading,
[652.54 → 653.26] we come and say,
[653.34 → 653.74] wait a minute,
[653.84 → 655.04] can she even conceive?
[656.38 → 657.78] Can she even have a kid?
[657.96 → 659.62] And there's a potential other roadblock.
[659.98 → 660.94] And then we read,
[660.98 → 661.84] oh, well, okay.
[662.54 → 663.32] Then we read,
[663.42 → 664.10] they made love.
[664.20 → 666.44] And then the Lord enabled her to conceive
[666.44 → 667.40] and she bared the son.
[667.40 → 670.40] And we see the hand of God at work here
[670.40 → 672.90] through ordinary life.
[672.90 → 677.34] It's interesting that in the rest of the story,
[677.76 → 680.14] Ruth is hardly mentioned.
[682.14 → 682.36] You know,
[682.56 → 685.28] it sounds like Naomi had a baby.
[686.70 → 686.86] Right?
[687.38 → 688.90] What's going on with that?
[689.44 → 692.00] And the writer wants us to see something.
[692.32 → 693.76] We think back of Naomi.
[694.18 → 694.46] All right?
[694.64 → 696.68] And she had all that hardship happen to her.
[696.68 → 697.62] And she says,
[697.92 → 700.98] God brought me back empty.
[702.90 → 703.66] Nothing.
[705.20 → 705.84] Her friends say,
[705.96 → 706.58] hey, Naomi,
[706.78 → 708.12] don't call me Naomi.
[708.48 → 710.36] My new name is Bitter.
[714.48 → 716.28] That's a lot.
[718.24 → 723.22] The book begins with loss and death and hurt.
[723.22 → 726.78] And it ends with new life and a future.
[728.66 → 731.76] And then we come to that verse 16 and 17.
[732.76 → 735.90] And then we see a son had been born to Naomi.
[736.80 → 740.84] And we begin to see hope again.
[741.50 → 744.02] But why does the author, right,
[744.12 → 744.28] you know,
[744.54 → 745.88] why does the author say,
[745.96 → 747.86] the son has been given to Naomi?
[747.86 → 748.70] Well,
[748.70 → 750.76] because he wants us to see
[750.76 → 753.92] that how she felt in the beginning,
[754.98 → 757.12] that that wasn't the truth.
[757.92 → 758.40] Albeit,
[758.72 → 759.82] hard things happened.
[761.06 → 761.40] And then,
[761.60 → 762.46] I think for us,
[762.52 → 763.24] as readers,
[763.52 → 766.14] who then try to tie this story
[766.14 → 767.18] to our own lives to some degree,
[767.46 → 768.62] we need to learn
[768.62 → 771.14] to trust that God is busy
[771.14 → 773.36] when we feel empty.
[773.36 → 777.96] Anyone here ever feel empty sometimes?
[779.70 → 781.34] I think we all do at times.
[781.94 → 784.32] When we want to be named bitter
[784.32 → 786.58] or loser or victim,
[789.38 → 790.18] then God is saying,
[790.38 → 791.10] that's not true.
[791.42 → 792.54] That's not who you are,
[792.62 → 794.02] even though that's how you feel.
[794.50 → 796.28] Ruth was written to help us
[796.28 → 798.52] see that signpost of grace
[798.52 → 799.20] that I talked about
[799.20 → 801.22] on the journey of the biblical story,
[801.50 → 802.30] where it says
[802.30 → 805.34] that the best is yet to come.
[807.40 → 809.32] Yeah, but my life is so awful right now.
[809.58 → 811.60] The best is yet to come.
[815.38 → 817.16] Naomi's life was hard.
[817.66 → 819.64] We don't need to minimize that.
[819.86 → 821.34] She had tremendous hardships.
[821.66 → 822.64] There's no denying that.
[822.70 → 824.04] There's no sugarcoating that.
[825.28 → 827.78] But the story is so much bigger
[827.78 → 829.70] than that brokenness
[829.70 → 831.32] that she's experiencing.
[832.30 → 836.72] God is at work in it all.
[837.52 → 838.60] And we get hints of that
[838.60 → 839.56] throughout the book of Ruth.
[840.16 → 842.04] In chapter 1,
[842.10 → 843.20] Ruth 1.16,
[843.70 → 843.88] right,
[844.00 → 845.14] when Naomi is saying,
[845.26 → 845.46] hey,
[846.14 → 846.54] Ruth,
[847.18 → 847.40] you know,
[847.48 → 849.38] we've all lost our husbands.
[849.52 → 850.52] We're all widows now.
[850.52 → 851.66] And Oprah,
[851.76 → 852.38] you as well,
[852.68 → 853.70] the other woman who was there.
[854.02 → 854.20] You know,
[854.36 → 855.40] why don't you guys
[855.40 → 856.64] just stay here?
[857.20 → 858.16] Stay in Moab.
[859.16 → 860.46] No sense you coming back
[860.46 → 861.96] with me to nothing.
[863.46 → 863.74] And then,
[863.84 → 865.02] but then Ruth says,
[865.16 → 866.38] and that was a famous line,
[866.70 → 867.78] don't urge me to leave you
[867.78 → 868.80] or turn back from you.
[868.96 → 869.42] Where you go,
[869.46 → 869.82] I will go.
[869.90 → 870.38] Where you stay,
[870.42 → 870.84] I will stay.
[871.10 → 872.14] Your people be my people.
[872.24 → 872.68] Your God,
[872.88 → 873.28] my God.
[873.38 → 875.02] And we see God at work
[875.02 → 877.12] in this wonderful daughter-in-law.
[878.54 → 878.94] Right?
[879.22 → 880.80] We jump ahead to chapter 2.
[881.74 → 882.14] You know,
[882.20 → 883.66] where Boaz sees
[883.66 → 884.94] how lovely Ruth
[884.94 → 886.82] is being to Naomi.
[887.02 → 887.56] And he says,
[887.84 → 889.04] may the Lord repay you
[889.04 → 889.96] for what you have done.
[890.22 → 891.72] May you be richly rewarded
[891.72 → 892.62] by the Lord,
[892.72 → 893.36] the God of Israel,
[893.74 → 894.86] under whose wings
[894.86 → 896.58] you have found refuge.
[896.58 → 897.10] Right?
[898.28 → 899.54] Let me get that wing thing,
[899.68 → 900.68] which is part of that
[900.68 → 901.72] chapter 3 as well.
[902.38 → 903.82] They can keep going
[903.82 → 904.48] all the time,
[904.52 → 905.22] even when it's hard,
[905.44 → 907.82] because God is at work.
[908.94 → 913.62] Naomi has said,
[913.68 → 914.48] yeah, you stay there.
[914.62 → 915.24] There's no hope.
[915.34 → 915.54] Right?
[915.76 → 916.76] But then later on,
[916.80 → 917.00] you know,
[917.02 → 917.78] she admits,
[918.16 → 918.36] right,
[918.48 → 919.56] in chapter 2,
[919.64 → 920.04] she admits
[920.04 → 921.00] that she sees
[921.00 → 922.34] hope of redemption.
[926.86 → 927.92] Here's my point.
[928.48 → 929.60] In our pain
[929.60 → 931.76] and in our loss,
[932.16 → 933.86] it's hard to see hope.
[934.30 → 935.70] But that doesn't mean
[935.70 → 936.66] it isn't there.
[938.94 → 941.92] Our hurts can blind us.
[943.90 → 944.92] And it's then
[944.92 → 946.34] that we need others
[946.34 → 948.30] to help us find hope.
[948.74 → 950.30] We need to find that hope
[950.30 → 951.22] through the kindness
[951.22 → 951.80] of others
[951.80 → 953.38] that help us cling to God
[953.38 → 954.32] when it's tough
[954.32 → 954.92] to keep going.
[955.14 → 956.12] People like Ruth,
[956.32 → 957.30] like Boaz.
[957.30 → 961.60] And then,
[962.00 → 962.42] you know,
[962.46 → 963.40] we read that part
[963.40 → 964.82] about Rachel and Leah
[964.82 → 965.68] that the guys
[965.68 → 966.86] in the town
[966.86 → 967.80] are talking about.
[968.02 → 968.18] Oh,
[968.20 → 969.62] may it be like Rachel and Leah.
[969.88 → 970.46] And if you know
[970.46 → 971.44] that story at all,
[971.62 → 973.04] that story involves Jacob.
[973.36 → 974.90] And Jacob is going to
[974.90 → 975.44] marry
[975.44 → 977.34] what he thinks
[977.34 → 978.10] is Rachel,
[978.64 → 980.02] but the dad
[980.02 → 981.36] cons him somehow
[981.36 → 982.12] and he ends up
[982.12 → 982.76] marrying Leah.
[983.40 → 984.38] And then later on
[984.38 → 984.98] he marries Rachel.
[984.98 → 985.42] So,
[985.84 → 986.62] this story,
[986.80 → 987.70] that story's a bit
[987.70 → 988.76] of a mess too.
[990.56 → 990.80] Right?
[990.92 → 992.02] Where there's this
[992.02 → 993.40] deception going on
[993.40 → 995.56] and false promises made
[995.56 → 996.76] and this poor Leah
[996.76 → 997.72] gets used.
[998.24 → 998.62] Anyway,
[998.90 → 999.98] and out of all that
[999.98 → 1000.42] broken,
[1000.64 → 1001.46] messy story,
[1002.80 → 1005.38] where Rachel is barren,
[1007.18 → 1008.28] eventually has kids,
[1008.58 → 1009.90] but Leah has a whole
[1009.90 → 1011.14] bunch of kids,
[1011.14 → 1012.22] and out of that,
[1012.30 → 1013.26] out of her comes
[1013.26 → 1013.98] Judah.
[1015.84 → 1016.10] Oh,
[1016.16 → 1016.34] okay,
[1016.46 → 1016.64] Judah,
[1016.76 → 1016.90] yeah,
[1016.92 → 1017.56] I know that name.
[1017.84 → 1018.08] Yeah,
[1018.18 → 1019.36] the line of Christ.
[1020.06 → 1021.08] But they also mention
[1021.08 → 1022.22] Judah and Tamar.
[1022.50 → 1023.64] I don't even want to
[1023.64 → 1024.92] talk about that mess.
[1027.46 → 1028.26] It's a kind of
[1028.26 → 1029.24] a sick story.
[1032.14 → 1033.02] I'll let you read it
[1033.02 → 1033.50] for yourself.
[1033.78 → 1034.26] You go ahead.
[1034.52 → 1034.86] Look up,
[1034.96 → 1035.32] you know,
[1035.40 → 1036.18] Judah and Tamar
[1036.18 → 1037.16] and you go read the story
[1037.16 → 1038.24] and you'll see what I mean.
[1038.24 → 1040.48] But these people know
[1040.48 → 1041.94] these messes happen.
[1042.26 → 1042.98] They're bringing up
[1042.98 → 1043.84] these horrible,
[1044.04 → 1044.70] messy stories
[1044.70 → 1045.84] and how God then,
[1046.06 → 1046.30] oh yeah,
[1046.36 → 1046.56] right,
[1046.62 → 1046.84] right,
[1047.06 → 1047.96] and out of that comes,
[1048.16 → 1048.84] and out of that comes,
[1049.00 → 1049.72] and there's Judah,
[1050.02 → 1050.58] and there's then,
[1050.80 → 1050.98] you know,
[1051.04 → 1051.52] I think,
[1052.44 → 1054.78] God was busy
[1054.78 → 1056.44] in that train wreck?
[1058.78 → 1059.26] Yeah.
[1061.14 → 1061.62] Yeah,
[1061.86 → 1062.12] yeah,
[1062.12 → 1062.56] he was.
[1063.98 → 1065.20] And he's busy
[1065.20 → 1066.34] in this messy story
[1066.34 → 1067.42] of Ruth too.
[1068.24 → 1069.72] And that's the point.
[1070.68 → 1071.70] That's the point.
[1073.20 → 1073.80] You know,
[1073.94 → 1075.28] that God is at work.
[1076.36 → 1077.94] And God gives Ruth
[1077.94 → 1079.88] a child for her sake
[1079.88 → 1081.50] and for Naomi's sake
[1081.50 → 1083.78] and for Boaz's sake.
[1085.00 → 1086.60] But more than that also,
[1087.70 → 1088.60] for us.
[1092.00 → 1092.96] For us.
[1094.78 → 1096.08] Ruth had a baby
[1096.08 → 1097.68] for you.
[1099.04 → 1099.54] What?
[1100.20 → 1101.80] How does that benefit me?
[1103.34 → 1104.34] Because the story
[1104.34 → 1105.10] keeps going.
[1106.40 → 1107.78] The story keeps going.
[1108.20 → 1109.02] And then I think
[1109.02 → 1109.76] of a passage
[1109.76 → 1110.24] in scripture
[1110.24 → 1112.04] like Philippians 2,
[1112.76 → 1113.74] verse 13.
[1115.40 → 1116.44] Look at it with me.
[1117.24 → 1117.72] There we go.
[1117.72 → 1119.18] For it is God
[1119.18 → 1120.50] who works in you
[1120.50 → 1121.72] to will
[1122.34 → 1123.46] and to act,
[1123.52 → 1124.22] to do what?
[1124.22 → 1126.10] in order to fulfill
[1126.10 → 1128.90] his good purpose.
[1130.32 → 1131.42] Was that exactly
[1131.42 → 1132.40] the same as my purpose?
[1132.52 → 1132.62] Well,
[1132.62 → 1133.12] maybe not.
[1135.12 → 1136.78] It's God's good purpose
[1136.78 → 1138.06] who sees the whole
[1138.06 → 1138.86] of things.
[1139.56 → 1140.80] I love how the psalmist
[1140.80 → 1142.18] expresses in Psalm 27.
[1142.74 → 1143.96] I remain confident
[1143.96 → 1144.66] of this,
[1144.72 → 1144.88] right?
[1144.96 → 1146.14] I may not have a lot
[1146.14 → 1146.42] of confidence,
[1146.48 → 1147.22] but I remain confident
[1147.22 → 1147.66] of this.
[1147.66 → 1148.96] I will see the goodness
[1148.96 → 1149.70] of the Lord
[1149.70 → 1150.82] in the land of the living.
[1151.32 → 1152.18] Wait for the Lord.
[1152.18 → 1152.98] Be strong,
[1153.10 → 1153.60] take heart,
[1153.92 → 1156.30] and wait for the Lord.
[1156.66 → 1159.04] Wait for the Redeemer.
[1162.58 → 1163.26] That's what
[1163.26 → 1165.90] Naomi tells Ruth too
[1165.90 → 1166.44] after they,
[1166.66 → 1167.12] you know,
[1167.16 → 1168.30] have the whole time
[1168.30 → 1169.02] where they try to
[1169.02 → 1171.44] encourage Boaz
[1171.44 → 1172.92] to propose
[1172.92 → 1174.32] and he kind of
[1174.32 → 1175.14] finally gets it.
[1175.30 → 1175.92] But, you know,
[1176.00 → 1177.14] then after that
[1177.14 → 1177.66] Naomi says,
[1177.76 → 1177.82] okay,
[1177.86 → 1178.48] we've done all we can,
[1178.54 → 1179.16] now we have to wait.
[1179.52 → 1179.66] Right?
[1179.82 → 1180.40] There's often,
[1180.58 → 1180.70] okay,
[1180.78 → 1181.84] you do what you can.
[1181.84 → 1183.50] And then you wait.
[1184.60 → 1185.10] You wait
[1185.10 → 1187.52] and along comes,
[1187.76 → 1187.98] right,
[1188.06 → 1188.96] the whole book of Ruth.
[1189.64 → 1190.14] You know,
[1190.38 → 1191.02] there's a little bit
[1191.02 → 1191.92] of a slide here
[1191.92 → 1194.04] showing a synopsis
[1194.04 → 1195.66] of their lives,
[1195.70 → 1195.86] right?
[1196.50 → 1197.56] You see it in the beginning,
[1197.70 → 1197.88] right?
[1198.26 → 1198.78] It's this,
[1199.08 → 1199.50] again,
[1199.62 → 1200.04] the theme here,
[1200.26 → 1200.98] wait for the Lord,
[1201.04 → 1201.18] right?
[1201.42 → 1202.90] In the first slide there,
[1202.98 → 1203.24] you see,
[1203.30 → 1203.38] oh,
[1203.44 → 1204.88] there's death,
[1205.10 → 1205.76] there are graves,
[1206.62 → 1206.88] right?
[1206.90 → 1207.34] And then there's
[1207.34 → 1208.16] widows travelling
[1208.16 → 1209.38] and you get a summary
[1209.38 → 1209.88] of the whole story,
[1209.96 → 1211.06] the gleaning of the fields
[1211.06 → 1212.26] and the barley
[1212.26 → 1213.02] that they get
[1213.02 → 1213.24] and,
[1213.92 → 1214.04] you know,
[1214.06 → 1214.28] even,
[1214.60 → 1215.64] you leave a little shot
[1215.64 → 1219.56] even of the steamy night.
[1221.64 → 1222.04] Right?
[1222.34 → 1222.54] And,
[1222.70 → 1223.34] but in the end,
[1223.68 → 1223.88] you know,
[1223.90 → 1224.54] there they are,
[1224.72 → 1224.96] right?
[1225.04 → 1225.78] There's a baby.
[1226.16 → 1226.76] There's hope,
[1227.02 → 1227.26] right?
[1227.26 → 1228.22] And that's what the writer's
[1228.22 → 1228.78] trying to say.
[1229.10 → 1229.86] The writer's trying to say,
[1230.24 → 1232.08] God has been busy
[1232.08 → 1234.02] this whole time.
[1235.38 → 1236.20] They've been caught up
[1236.20 → 1237.30] in such brokenness.
[1238.58 → 1238.76] Right?
[1239.12 → 1240.64] Along comes Boaz,
[1240.76 → 1242.10] coincidence of all coincidence.
[1242.54 → 1243.16] And Ruth happened
[1243.16 → 1243.92] to go to that field.
[1244.14 → 1244.94] And Ruth and Boaz
[1244.94 → 1245.68] do get married
[1245.68 → 1246.58] and they do have a son.
[1246.86 → 1247.70] And Naomi takes
[1247.70 → 1248.70] such joy in that,
[1248.96 → 1249.76] as do we,
[1250.34 → 1251.72] as the readers.
[1251.72 → 1252.96] But there's so much
[1252.96 → 1253.72] more going on.
[1255.06 → 1255.54] They could have
[1255.54 → 1256.64] ended the story
[1256.64 → 1257.14] right there
[1257.14 → 1258.02] with just that baby.
[1260.26 → 1260.48] You know,
[1260.58 → 1261.42] Naomi no longer
[1261.42 → 1262.50] calling herself bitter
[1262.50 → 1264.16] with a baby in her arms.
[1264.42 → 1264.66] And we say,
[1264.70 → 1264.86] ah,
[1264.90 → 1266.02] that's beautiful.
[1266.12 → 1266.78] That's wonderful.
[1266.92 → 1267.38] And it is.
[1268.44 → 1269.78] But the writer goes on.
[1270.60 → 1271.70] No longer do we hear
[1271.70 → 1272.30] from Ruth
[1272.30 → 1273.68] or Boaz
[1273.68 → 1274.44] or Naomi.
[1274.44 → 1277.78] And we re-read,
[1277.98 → 1278.58] and I read you
[1278.58 → 1280.24] that little synopsis
[1280.24 → 1280.98] of their story,
[1281.10 → 1281.28] right?
[1281.40 → 1282.20] We have Perez
[1282.20 → 1284.58] and even a guy
[1284.58 → 1285.48] named after a fish,
[1285.62 → 1285.98] Salmon.
[1286.74 → 1287.98] And, you know,
[1288.10 → 1289.16] and then in the end
[1289.16 → 1289.56] it's, you know,
[1289.60 → 1290.00] they come,
[1290.24 → 1291.24] lead to the line of David.
[1291.46 → 1292.56] You can read Matthew 1,
[1292.62 → 1293.70] see a bit of a longer version.
[1294.06 → 1294.98] And we are taken
[1294.98 → 1295.96] much further
[1295.96 → 1296.74] down the road
[1296.74 → 1297.50] of redemption.
[1297.98 → 1299.08] Way beyond Ruth
[1299.08 → 1299.74] and Boaz
[1299.74 → 1300.20] and Naomi.
[1302.12 → 1302.88] God is looking
[1302.88 → 1303.68] much further
[1303.68 → 1305.02] than just
[1305.02 → 1307.10] our individual lives.
[1308.24 → 1309.34] Albeit that matters.
[1310.62 → 1312.28] Not just a lovely ending
[1312.28 → 1313.26] for Ruth and Boaz
[1313.26 → 1314.26] but so much more.
[1314.44 → 1315.74] It brings the story
[1315.74 → 1316.46] of redemption
[1316.46 → 1318.76] to all of us.
[1319.52 → 1321.64] And beyond us as well.
[1322.42 → 1323.56] To the line of David
[1323.56 → 1324.84] that has no end.
[1325.42 → 1326.12] And so I want to read
[1326.12 → 1327.18] now Luke 2,
[1327.78 → 1328.54] verse 4.
[1330.34 → 1331.36] Luke 2, 4.
[1332.16 → 1332.42] So,
[1332.66 → 1333.66] now we jump ahead.
[1334.10 → 1335.00] So, Joseph.
[1336.30 → 1337.02] Another guy
[1337.02 → 1338.32] with a lot of integrity
[1338.32 → 1340.16] lives in this town
[1340.16 → 1340.84] of Nazareth.
[1341.72 → 1342.50] A lot of integrity.
[1343.08 → 1344.10] He loves Mary.
[1344.54 → 1346.08] Mary gives him news
[1346.08 → 1347.02] of a baby
[1347.02 → 1348.02] that she's expecting
[1348.02 → 1348.90] and it's not his.
[1349.22 → 1349.68] And being a man
[1349.68 → 1350.18] of integrity
[1350.18 → 1351.08] he's going to quietly
[1351.08 → 1351.74] divorce her,
[1352.04 → 1352.98] take care of things
[1352.98 → 1353.52] but then, yeah,
[1353.56 → 1354.34] that angel comes.
[1354.66 → 1355.38] And they end up
[1355.38 → 1357.00] going to Bethlehem
[1357.00 → 1358.94] because Caesar Augustus,
[1359.00 → 1359.18] right,
[1359.18 → 1359.92] and somehow God
[1359.92 → 1361.82] is using the political
[1361.82 → 1362.74] scene of the world
[1362.74 → 1363.36] somehow too.
[1363.70 → 1364.84] To Bethlehem.
[1364.90 → 1365.46] And Bethlehem,
[1365.66 → 1366.34] oh, that's where
[1366.34 → 1367.00] Ruth was from, right?
[1367.22 → 1367.94] And Bethlehem
[1367.94 → 1369.20] to the town of David
[1369.20 → 1369.78] because what?
[1369.78 → 1370.68] He belonged
[1370.68 → 1371.48] to the house
[1371.48 → 1373.16] and line of David.
[1373.16 → 1379.02] all these threads,
[1379.48 → 1380.64] all these moments,
[1380.94 → 1382.36] all being tied together
[1382.36 → 1384.14] in God's majestic plan
[1384.14 → 1386.42] in this amazing road
[1386.42 → 1387.50] to redemption.
[1388.02 → 1389.24] Not just a lovely
[1389.24 → 1390.24] ending story
[1390.24 → 1391.38] for a bunch of people
[1391.38 → 1392.50] but so much more.
[1392.50 → 1394.62] all our,
[1394.72 → 1396.10] and there comes Jesus
[1396.10 → 1397.20] and he comes
[1397.20 → 1397.88] into the world
[1397.88 → 1399.42] and all our brokenness
[1399.42 → 1400.12] and all our pain
[1400.12 → 1400.86] and all our sins
[1400.86 → 1401.54] are somehow
[1401.54 → 1402.96] taken care of
[1402.96 → 1403.80] in him.
[1406.20 → 1407.58] But we hit roadblocks.
[1408.50 → 1409.66] Jesus dies.
[1410.94 → 1411.46] What?
[1411.80 → 1413.08] But he's our redeemer.
[1414.46 → 1414.82] Yeah,
[1415.06 → 1415.90] he's redeeming
[1415.90 → 1416.56] through death.
[1416.76 → 1417.32] Oh, wait,
[1417.46 → 1418.16] I didn't see
[1418.16 → 1418.82] that one coming.
[1419.10 → 1420.18] And he rises again
[1420.18 → 1421.08] and he ascends
[1421.08 → 1421.54] to heaven
[1421.54 → 1422.92] and he reigns on high
[1422.92 → 1424.10] and he will come again
[1424.10 → 1425.52] to make all things right
[1425.52 → 1426.52] because that's
[1426.52 → 1427.96] what's going on here.
[1431.10 → 1432.28] And in the meantime,
[1433.40 → 1434.42] it's Advent.
[1436.54 → 1437.86] It's a season of waiting.
[1439.10 → 1440.34] The kingdom has come
[1440.34 → 1441.92] but some of it not yet
[1441.92 → 1443.06] and we are given hope
[1443.06 → 1443.92] that God will continue
[1443.92 → 1444.50] to be at work
[1444.50 → 1445.20] in it all
[1445.20 → 1445.88] and through it all
[1445.88 → 1447.14] and in the details
[1447.14 → 1449.28] of our individual lives,
[1449.78 → 1451.00] our ordinary lives.
[1451.00 → 1452.44] and we see how God works
[1452.44 → 1454.38] in those ordinary things,
[1454.48 → 1455.72] in the gleaning of fields
[1455.72 → 1457.14] and through having babies
[1457.14 → 1458.14] and through losses
[1458.14 → 1459.56] and through setbacks
[1459.56 → 1460.48] that God is busy
[1460.48 → 1462.66] and all our extraordinary God
[1462.66 → 1463.52] is busy
[1463.52 → 1465.14] in ordinary lives.
[1468.98 → 1469.90] In your life.
[1472.40 → 1473.80] Where the Lord is busy
[1473.80 → 1474.72] unpacking
[1474.72 → 1476.60] his eternal plan.
[1476.60 → 1482.14] And we see the sign.
[1482.14 → 1483.36] We see it in Ruth
[1483.36 → 1484.42] and we see it
[1484.42 → 1485.38] in the story of Scripture.
[1486.00 → 1486.92] And we see the sign
[1486.92 → 1488.06] along the highway of life,
[1488.56 → 1489.16] the best
[1489.16 → 1490.96] is yet
[1490.96 → 1492.22] to come.
[1497.08 → 1498.08] His Advent,
[1498.54 → 1499.88] not quite,
[1499.88 → 1503.64] but this tied so well
[1503.64 → 1506.74] to the story of Ruth.
[1508.58 → 1509.58] And for Advent,
[1509.76 → 1510.58] we light candles.
[1511.70 → 1513.02] One candle per week
[1513.02 → 1514.56] concluding with
[1514.56 → 1515.68] the Christ candle
[1515.68 → 1517.12] on Christmas.
[1518.56 → 1519.52] Christmas Eve, actually.
[1520.64 → 1521.40] And we're going to have
[1521.40 → 1522.06] a piece of art
[1522.06 → 1523.84] for each of the Advent Sundays.
[1523.96 → 1524.44] This is the one
[1524.44 → 1525.48] I have today.
[1525.54 → 1526.04] I'm going to do
[1526.04 → 1527.20] the first Advent reading
[1527.20 → 1527.60] but we'll have
[1527.60 → 1528.34] different people
[1528.34 → 1529.32] reading.
[1532.14 → 1533.10] This is a season
[1533.10 → 1533.60] of waiting
[1533.60 → 1534.60] for our Redeemer.
[1535.82 → 1536.60] And this is what
[1536.60 → 1537.20] we're celebrating.
[1537.68 → 1539.14] And in the Advent season,
[1539.32 → 1540.10] we're going to light
[1540.10 → 1540.78] these candles.
[1542.18 → 1542.70] And today,
[1542.94 → 1543.88] I'm going to light
[1543.88 → 1544.56] the first candle.
[1544.66 → 1545.18] Hopefully I get
[1545.18 → 1545.68] this thing lit.
[1546.40 → 1546.98] There we go.
[1552.26 → 1553.00] We're going to light
[1553.00 → 1553.70] this candle
[1553.70 → 1556.34] thinking of Ruth's story.
[1557.20 → 1558.72] Where her ordinary life
[1558.72 → 1561.40] is woven into the line
[1561.40 → 1562.52] and story
[1562.52 → 1564.06] of Jesus Christ.
[1565.66 → 1566.42] Like yours.
[1568.20 → 1569.22] In Romans 15,
[1569.32 → 1570.04] we read this.
[1570.24 → 1570.84] And Paul says,
[1570.90 → 1571.32] and again,
[1571.44 → 1572.30] Isaiah says,
[1572.66 → 1574.02] the root of Jesse.
[1574.42 → 1574.60] Okay.
[1575.02 → 1575.52] There should be,
[1575.62 → 1576.44] you can see a stump
[1576.44 → 1577.28] in this piece of art.
[1577.60 → 1578.90] The root of Jesse.
[1579.02 → 1580.06] But it's grown, right?
[1580.26 → 1581.04] The root of Jesse.
[1581.14 → 1581.90] It looks dead.
[1582.10 → 1582.86] Will spring up.
[1582.96 → 1583.36] There's something
[1583.36 → 1583.86] that's going to grow
[1583.86 → 1585.50] out of that dead stump.
[1585.50 → 1586.64] Who will arise
[1586.64 → 1587.92] to rule over the nation.
[1588.28 → 1588.70] And in him,
[1588.78 → 1589.52] the Gentiles,
[1589.78 → 1590.32] that's you and I,
[1590.56 → 1591.74] will have hope.
[1592.28 → 1593.54] May the God of hope
[1593.54 → 1595.40] fill you with all joy
[1595.40 → 1596.06] and peace
[1596.06 → 1597.14] as you trust in him.
[1597.40 → 1598.26] So that you
[1598.26 → 1599.28] may overflow
[1599.28 → 1600.84] with hope
[1600.84 → 1601.66] by the power
[1601.66 → 1602.46] of the Holy Spirit.
[1604.46 → 1605.34] And we read
[1605.34 → 1606.84] how a living shoot
[1606.84 → 1607.32] will come out
[1607.32 → 1608.54] of a seemingly dead stump.
[1608.68 → 1609.64] The stump of Jesse.
[1610.84 → 1611.64] David's dad.
[1611.64 → 1613.36] And here in this art,
[1613.48 → 1614.36] we see Jesus
[1614.36 → 1616.10] sitting comfortably
[1616.10 → 1617.36] in the heart of the tree.
[1618.50 → 1620.42] He's holding it all together.
[1621.76 → 1622.34] And notice,
[1622.46 → 1623.84] he's not a branch.
[1625.28 → 1626.42] He's not a branch,
[1626.96 → 1627.94] but a continuation
[1627.94 → 1628.72] of the trunk.
[1628.98 → 1630.28] He is a source of life.
[1630.50 → 1631.48] And in him,
[1631.60 → 1632.48] everything finds
[1632.48 → 1633.48] its proper place.
[1634.34 → 1635.66] We are reminded again
[1635.66 → 1637.70] of God's grand story
[1637.70 → 1639.22] of hope for the world.
[1639.22 → 1640.90] And so today,
[1641.04 → 1642.20] we light this candle
[1642.20 → 1644.52] reflecting God's faithfulness
[1644.52 → 1645.26] throughout history.
[1645.98 → 1647.90] A story that is fulfilled
[1647.90 → 1650.20] in the coming of Jesus,
[1651.66 → 1652.38] who we might say
[1652.38 → 1653.02] is son of David.
[1653.94 → 1655.90] And in this season of Advent,
[1656.64 → 1658.14] we await Emmanuel,
[1658.60 → 1659.12] which means
[1659.12 → 1660.68] the Lord with us.
[1662.00 → 1662.98] Will you pray with me?
[1664.96 → 1665.84] Father God,
[1665.94 → 1667.24] we are so grateful
[1667.24 → 1670.00] that you unpack
[1670.00 → 1671.28] your story
[1671.28 → 1673.02] through our lives.
[1674.38 → 1675.22] We thank you
[1675.22 → 1676.14] that you are sovereign,
[1676.96 → 1678.18] that you are almighty,
[1679.12 → 1679.82] that you tie
[1679.82 → 1680.86] all the threads together,
[1681.00 → 1681.52] that you use
[1681.52 → 1682.54] everything that happens
[1682.54 → 1684.46] even when we don't get it.
[1685.90 → 1686.88] And that somehow,
[1687.52 → 1688.94] you take ordinary lives
[1688.94 → 1689.66] and make your
[1689.66 → 1691.10] extraordinary will happen.
[1691.74 → 1692.18] And for that,
[1692.26 → 1692.94] we praise you
[1692.94 → 1694.76] now and forever.
[1694.76 → 1696.82] will you help each of us
[1696.82 → 1699.14] to await our Redeemer
[1699.14 → 1700.62] in this Advent season
[1700.62 → 1701.84] by preparing our hearts
[1701.84 → 1702.50] for your coming
[1702.50 → 1704.94] so that we may celebrate
[1704.94 → 1706.56] our Redeemer,
[1707.50 → 1707.98] Emmanuel,
[1708.66 → 1709.48] God with us.
[1710.08 → 1710.32] Amen.
[1710.32 → 1716.42] I invite you to stand
[1716.42 → 1717.20] as we sing
[1717.20 → 1718.40] our first
[1718.40 → 1720.52] together.
[1720.72 → 1720.74] Thank you.
[1721.08 → 1721.54] Do you poor
[1721.54 → 1722.50] having us
[1722.50 → 1730.88] your Moon
[1730.88 → 1731.88] who is
[1733.16 → 1734.26] paying né
[1734.52 → 1735.32] going
[1735.32 → 1735.62] the
[1735.70 → 1736.12] way
[1736.12 → 1736.90] to
[1737.14 → 1738.06] the
[1738.06 → 1739.26] time
[1739.26 → 1740.86] to
