[0.00 --> 6.52]  Well, good morning, Hope.
[7.50 --> 8.52]  Welcome to worship.
[10.36 --> 11.44]  Good morning, Bill.
[13.38 --> 16.22]  This is the last sermon in our series on Jonah,
[16.36 --> 18.56]  and if you've been following with us throughout it,
[18.66 --> 21.84]  this will be our last sermon before we enter next week into the season of Lent,
[21.92 --> 24.18]  where we journey with Christ to the cross.
[24.66 --> 27.00]  But our hope is, after this series on Jonah,
[27.00 --> 31.50]  that you will be able to articulate to anyone who asks how the book of Jonah goes,
[31.60 --> 33.50]  because it's not a book about a whale.
[34.48 --> 39.48]  It's a book about a rebellious prophet who hates God because God loves his enemies.
[40.32 --> 44.48]  And it's about God pursuing that prophet and bringing him to a posture of repentance
[44.48 --> 47.86]  so that God could have the same kind of concern for a city,
[48.78 --> 51.56]  so that Jonah could have that concern the way God does.
[52.52 --> 55.62]  If you have your Bible, I invite you to turn with me to Jonah chapter 4.
[55.62 --> 59.72]  We're going to read the end of this story, starting in verse 5.
[68.16 --> 72.08]  Jonah went out and sat at a place east of the city.
[72.88 --> 75.52]  There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade,
[75.58 --> 77.90]  and waited to see what would happen to the city.
[78.88 --> 80.98]  Then the Lord God provided a gourd
[80.98 --> 84.34]  and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head,
[84.40 --> 85.52]  to ease his discomfort.
[86.40 --> 88.64]  And Jonah was very happy about the gourd.
[89.40 --> 91.72]  But at dawn the next day, God provided a worm,
[91.80 --> 93.72]  which chewed the gourd so that it withered.
[94.32 --> 97.24]  When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind,
[97.36 --> 100.14]  and a sun blazed on Jonah's head so that he grew faint.
[100.90 --> 102.30]  He wanted to die and said,
[102.38 --> 104.56]  it would be better for me to die than to live.
[104.56 --> 106.52]  But God said to Jonah,
[107.10 --> 109.26]  is it right for you to be angry about the gourd?
[109.98 --> 112.86]  It is, he said, and I'm so angry I wish I were dead.
[114.08 --> 115.00]  But the Lord said,
[115.68 --> 117.20]  you've been concerned about this gourd,
[117.30 --> 119.48]  though you did not tend to it or make it grow.
[119.82 --> 122.20]  It sprang up overnight and it died overnight.
[123.08 --> 126.36]  And should I not have concern for the great city Nineveh,
[126.42 --> 129.06]  in which there are more than 120,000 people
[129.06 --> 131.50]  who cannot tell their right hand from their left,
[131.50 --> 134.42]  and also many animals?
[138.00 --> 140.32]  Well, a few years ago, I was watching an interview
[140.32 --> 142.12]  with a pastor from Seattle.
[142.24 --> 143.40]  His name was Jeff Vanderstel.
[144.16 --> 145.12]  And they were interviewing him
[145.12 --> 146.68]  about church planting in Seattle.
[146.78 --> 149.50]  And he was sharing about how hard it was to do ministry
[149.50 --> 151.86]  and plant a church in the place that is Seattle.
[151.96 --> 154.32]  Because Seattle, just like Vancouver,
[154.84 --> 157.82]  has been stereotyped as the graveyard for churches.
[159.02 --> 160.10]  And it's stereotyped that way
[160.10 --> 162.66]  because most plants in Seattle don't make it.
[163.36 --> 165.86]  Most churches in the urban centers of Seattle
[165.86 --> 168.32]  and Vancouver are in survival mode.
[168.44 --> 169.68]  They're shrinking, they're struggling,
[169.94 --> 171.70]  they're sort of worrying about their future,
[171.98 --> 173.04]  and it's hard.
[173.94 --> 175.68]  In fact, I remember a regent prof once saying
[175.68 --> 178.06]  that he supported seven church plants in a row
[178.06 --> 179.38]  in downtown Vancouver,
[179.50 --> 180.76]  and none of them succeeded
[180.76 --> 181.86]  because it's just so hard.
[182.52 --> 183.68]  The pastor said how in Seattle,
[183.86 --> 185.58]  a lot of people downtown have a good life.
[185.74 --> 186.76]  You know, they've got their tech job,
[186.84 --> 187.48]  they've got their family,
[187.60 --> 188.40]  they've got their dog,
[188.46 --> 189.16]  they've got their Starbucks.
[189.16 --> 190.30]  They don't want Jesus.
[191.08 --> 192.14]  And that's a hard reality.
[193.12 --> 194.58]  And he described a practice
[194.58 --> 195.74]  near the end of the interview
[195.74 --> 197.02]  that I found very interesting.
[197.16 --> 199.00]  He would walk through the downtown core
[199.00 --> 200.96]  and he'd just look at the buildings and he'd pray.
[201.48 --> 203.88]  And he would see just thousands of condos
[203.88 --> 205.56]  in these apartments that line the street
[205.56 --> 206.82]  very high up in the sky.
[208.16 --> 209.82]  And he said that he would often get emotional
[209.82 --> 211.28]  thinking of how there were just thousands
[211.28 --> 213.32]  and thousands of people who did not know Jesus,
[214.08 --> 215.32]  did not know the power of his love,
[215.46 --> 216.76]  did not know the depth of his grace,
[216.76 --> 219.08]  did not know the goodness of his rule.
[220.04 --> 222.16]  And then at the very last statement of the interview,
[222.28 --> 222.74]  he said,
[223.52 --> 226.42]  if that reality doesn't affect you,
[227.42 --> 231.38]  I pray that God will break your heart
[231.38 --> 233.02]  for your city.
[233.02 --> 236.38]  Now Jonah,
[236.50 --> 237.58]  if I'm reading it right,
[238.10 --> 239.74]  is a story about a prophet
[239.74 --> 242.08]  whose heart is very much not broken
[242.08 --> 243.66]  for the city of Nineveh.
[244.46 --> 246.86]  Jonah has been running from his call to Nineveh
[246.86 --> 248.20]  because he had a hunch
[248.20 --> 250.46]  that God would show compassion to the city
[250.46 --> 251.84]  and he wanted nothing
[251.84 --> 254.36]  to do with that compassion.
[255.02 --> 256.90]  Even after God shows compassion,
[257.38 --> 258.98]  Jonah then spills his anger
[258.98 --> 260.14]  towards God.
[260.14 --> 262.56]  And now we get to the very end of the story.
[262.90 --> 263.72]  The very end of the story,
[263.82 --> 264.36]  in my opinion,
[264.46 --> 266.48]  is strange and even abrupt, right?
[267.06 --> 268.32]  It shows Jonah's anger
[268.32 --> 269.34]  going into happiness
[269.34 --> 270.22]  over this little plant
[270.22 --> 271.06]  then back to anger
[271.06 --> 271.76]  and then we finish
[271.76 --> 272.72]  with God asking him
[272.72 --> 275.02]  a really important question.
[275.10 --> 276.00]  A question that we're going to spend
[276.00 --> 277.16]  most of our time on today.
[277.42 --> 278.48]  And the question is simple.
[279.44 --> 279.80]  Jonah,
[280.36 --> 282.56]  should I not be concerned
[282.56 --> 283.60]  with Nineveh?
[284.48 --> 285.04]  And of course,
[285.16 --> 286.26]  in that question is the invitation.
[286.46 --> 286.72]  Jonah,
[286.72 --> 289.00]  should you not share my concern
[289.00 --> 290.32]  for Nineveh?
[291.04 --> 292.38]  So let's take a look at our passage.
[293.38 --> 294.46]  It starts with Jonah
[294.46 --> 295.64]  going outside the city, right?
[295.66 --> 296.32]  He preached to the city,
[296.40 --> 296.92]  they repented,
[297.02 --> 297.72]  he's upset about that.
[297.76 --> 298.68]  He goes outside the city
[298.68 --> 299.92]  and sets up a little shelter,
[300.38 --> 301.26]  presumably on a hill,
[301.58 --> 302.16]  in hopes,
[302.28 --> 303.00]  don't forget this,
[303.28 --> 304.76]  in hopes that somehow
[304.76 --> 306.44]  the Ninevehites might turn
[306.44 --> 307.16]  from their repentance,
[307.34 --> 308.40]  go back to their wicked ways
[308.40 --> 309.64]  and still get God's judgment.
[310.06 --> 311.16]  That's where Jonah's heart is at.
[311.40 --> 312.06]  He's sort of waiting
[312.06 --> 312.66]  and seeing,
[312.78 --> 313.62]  well, what's going to happen?
[314.28 --> 315.28]  And in that waiting,
[315.98 --> 317.90]  God gives him a parable, right?
[317.94 --> 319.04]  I think what we need to understand
[319.04 --> 320.14]  about the story of the gourd,
[320.26 --> 321.50]  which is sort of a leafy plant
[321.50 --> 322.28]  or a leafy vine,
[322.68 --> 324.40]  this is a parable for Jonah.
[324.70 --> 326.04]  And God's going to explain himself
[326.04 --> 326.84]  what it's all about.
[327.20 --> 328.70]  But this parable is basically God,
[328.78 --> 329.20]  and this is real,
[329.26 --> 330.76]  he plants this plant beside Jonah,
[330.84 --> 331.48]  it grows up,
[331.66 --> 332.70]  and it gives him shade
[332.70 --> 333.98]  because he's in the hot desert, right?
[334.46 --> 335.04]  And Jonah,
[335.20 --> 336.30]  this is probably one of my favorite parts
[336.30 --> 336.84]  of this passage,
[337.04 --> 338.42]  Jonah, who's this emotional wreck,
[338.46 --> 338.96]  he's up and down,
[339.02 --> 339.64]  he's angry at God,
[339.64 --> 340.28]  he wants to die,
[340.36 --> 341.90]  we're told he was very happy
[341.90 --> 343.48]  about that little leafy plant.
[343.80 --> 344.62]  He's just so delighted
[344.62 --> 345.56]  by that piece of shade.
[346.90 --> 347.42]  And then, of course,
[347.46 --> 348.00]  it goes sideways.
[348.28 --> 349.78]  God brings a little worm,
[350.06 --> 350.82]  it eats the plant,
[351.14 --> 351.88]  the tree withers,
[352.04 --> 352.76]  the leaves wither,
[352.82 --> 354.22]  and then Jonah gets very angry
[354.22 --> 355.66]  at God again, right?
[355.76 --> 356.62]  And I want to read for you
[356.62 --> 357.32]  this dialogue
[357.32 --> 358.66]  at the end of this parable
[358.66 --> 359.48]  God gives Jonah.
[359.60 --> 360.60]  And we read in verse 9,
[361.04 --> 362.20]  a real window, by the way,
[362.24 --> 363.28]  into Jonah's personality.
[363.90 --> 364.64]  God says to him,
[364.80 --> 366.36]  is it right for you
[366.36 --> 367.78]  to be angry about the plant?
[368.62 --> 369.26]  What does he say?
[369.90 --> 370.62]  It is!
[371.34 --> 372.34]  And then he goes on to say,
[372.42 --> 373.14]  I'm so angry,
[373.24 --> 374.12]  I wish I were dead.
[374.88 --> 375.46]  And in this moment,
[375.56 --> 376.28]  I can't help but think
[376.28 --> 377.16]  this guy reminds me
[377.16 --> 377.82]  of like an emotionally
[377.82 --> 378.82]  unstable teenager.
[379.54 --> 380.64]  Am I the only one?
[380.80 --> 381.46]  Patty's with me.
[383.02 --> 384.02]  And just so you know,
[384.22 --> 386.08]  we are meant to respond that way
[386.08 --> 387.26]  to this part of the story.
[387.64 --> 388.48]  Remember how I've said
[388.48 --> 389.36]  the whole book of Jonah
[389.36 --> 390.60]  has this satirical,
[391.00 --> 392.46]  hyperbolic edge to it
[392.46 --> 393.32]  where you're meant to be like,
[393.46 --> 394.92]  what's wrong with this guy?
[395.52 --> 396.60]  He's yelling at God,
[396.68 --> 397.66]  he's angry at forgiveness,
[397.92 --> 399.02]  he wants to die
[399.02 --> 400.08]  because a plant withered.
[400.08 --> 401.86]  And remember how this book functions
[401.86 --> 403.70]  to read the reader, right?
[403.78 --> 404.56]  Jonah is a mirror.
[404.68 --> 405.70]  He represents Israel
[405.70 --> 407.38]  and he's exposing Israel
[407.38 --> 408.48]  who would be reading this
[408.48 --> 408.66]  and like,
[408.74 --> 409.68]  oh, this guy's ridiculous.
[410.38 --> 411.30]  And they're right.
[411.70 --> 412.74]  And it exposes
[412.74 --> 413.92]  how ridiculous they are.
[414.96 --> 415.92]  Let me explain.
[416.72 --> 417.48]  If you've walked
[417.48 --> 418.24]  through this book with us,
[418.28 --> 418.80]  you will know
[418.80 --> 419.62]  or have seen
[419.62 --> 420.86]  that every time
[420.86 --> 422.04]  Jonah gets happy,
[422.46 --> 423.72]  every time he gets excited,
[423.72 --> 425.18]  it's when he receives
[425.18 --> 426.58]  the benefits, right?
[426.72 --> 427.90]  He gets thrown off the ship,
[428.04 --> 428.78]  rescued by a whale.
[428.86 --> 430.42]  He's so delighted to live.
[430.68 --> 431.74]  Then he goes to Nineveh
[431.74 --> 433.44]  and he's got this whole thing
[433.44 --> 433.82]  where he's upset
[433.82 --> 434.70]  with God's compassion,
[434.96 --> 435.94]  but then a little plant
[435.94 --> 436.92]  comes over his head.
[437.42 --> 438.10]  Oh, man,
[438.14 --> 439.18]  he's happy about that plant.
[440.04 --> 440.98]  But then, right,
[441.36 --> 442.24]  the Ninevites repent
[442.24 --> 443.40]  and he's furious with God.
[443.94 --> 445.12]  The plant withers
[445.12 --> 446.72]  and he wants to die.
[447.48 --> 448.50]  And what this shows us,
[448.60 --> 449.28]  in my opinion,
[449.70 --> 452.12]  is how ridiculously selfish
[452.12 --> 453.46]  Jonah is.
[454.14 --> 455.14]  He's that person
[455.14 --> 456.44]  who wants all the grace
[456.44 --> 456.92]  for himself,
[457.08 --> 458.00]  all the favor of God
[458.00 --> 458.68]  to land on him,
[458.78 --> 459.68]  and he wants none
[459.68 --> 460.20]  of that grace,
[460.36 --> 460.98]  none of that favor,
[461.10 --> 461.66]  none of that kindness
[461.66 --> 462.36]  for other people.
[463.54 --> 464.10]  Does that sound a bit
[464.10 --> 464.72]  like us today?
[465.74 --> 466.96]  A selfishness that says,
[467.18 --> 468.18]  I deserve all this,
[468.26 --> 469.26]  I want all this for me,
[469.34 --> 470.40]  but I don't really care
[470.40 --> 472.52]  or desire that for my enemies,
[473.28 --> 474.54]  for the people that I dislike
[474.54 --> 475.90]  and remove myself from.
[476.72 --> 478.30]  Jonah expresses
[478.30 --> 479.72]  and represents
[479.72 --> 481.18]  the selfishness
[481.18 --> 482.16]  of believers.
[486.08 --> 486.98]  And now I want us
[486.98 --> 487.40]  to note
[487.40 --> 489.04]  how God answers
[489.04 --> 490.32]  and explains the parable.
[490.98 --> 491.92]  God gets the last word
[491.92 --> 492.66]  in the book of Jonah.
[493.14 --> 494.06]  And this is what he says,
[494.10 --> 494.58]  I'll read it again,
[494.66 --> 495.04]  verse 10.
[495.12 --> 495.78]  He says to Jonah,
[495.78 --> 497.04]  you have been concerned
[497.04 --> 498.66]  about this plant.
[499.46 --> 500.64]  Though you did not tend it
[500.64 --> 501.54]  or make it grow,
[501.64 --> 502.42]  it sprang up overnight
[502.42 --> 503.64]  and it died overnight.
[504.06 --> 507.12]  And should I not have concern
[507.12 --> 509.12]  for the great city of Nineveh,
[509.58 --> 510.16]  in which there are more
[510.16 --> 511.62]  than 120,000 people
[511.62 --> 512.98]  and animals?
[515.36 --> 516.58]  God's basically saying to Jonah,
[516.70 --> 517.86]  you're worried about a plant?
[518.58 --> 519.96]  I am concerned
[519.96 --> 521.76]  about 120,000 people
[521.76 --> 522.92]  as well as their animals.
[523.58 --> 524.38]  And you might say
[524.38 --> 525.42]  that this is the heart
[525.42 --> 526.50]  of the whole book right here,
[526.56 --> 527.06]  this question.
[527.38 --> 528.80]  Are you not concerned?
[529.34 --> 530.80]  Because I'm concerned.
[531.20 --> 532.44]  And he wants Jonah to know
[532.44 --> 533.42]  and share in
[533.42 --> 534.94]  his concern for Nineveh.
[535.08 --> 535.90]  This is an invitation.
[536.56 --> 537.32]  And I want to suggest
[537.32 --> 538.24]  that this is not just true
[538.24 --> 538.80]  for Jonah.
[539.18 --> 539.66]  It's not just true
[539.66 --> 540.44]  for Israel at that time.
[540.50 --> 542.36]  It's true for the church today.
[543.72 --> 546.56]  Are you not concerned?
[548.96 --> 549.88]  Now I want to say
[549.88 --> 550.58]  at the very outset,
[550.58 --> 551.80]  and I've mentioned this before
[551.80 --> 552.54]  in our sermon series,
[552.64 --> 553.20]  that we are not
[553.20 --> 554.20]  in the same place as Jonah.
[554.48 --> 555.84]  Jonah lived within Israel,
[555.94 --> 557.26]  which was a religious nation.
[557.66 --> 558.54]  And Jonah had hatred
[558.54 --> 559.30]  towards Assyria,
[559.38 --> 560.04]  which was a different
[560.04 --> 560.80]  religious nation.
[560.80 --> 561.96]  And they were very separated.
[562.52 --> 563.36]  And we live in a
[563.36 --> 564.22]  completely different context.
[564.38 --> 565.32]  We are a small group
[565.32 --> 566.48]  of Christians living
[566.48 --> 568.04]  within Nineveh, right?
[568.10 --> 568.58]  Jonah could never
[568.58 --> 569.22]  have imagined that,
[569.26 --> 570.32]  that Christians would sort of live
[570.32 --> 571.40]  or believers would live
[571.40 --> 572.32]  within the country
[572.32 --> 573.82]  of another pagan society.
[573.82 --> 574.78]  But that's the situation
[574.78 --> 575.28]  we're in.
[575.34 --> 575.80]  It's different
[575.80 --> 576.86]  and it has some of the
[576.86 --> 578.84]  unique and similar challenges.
[578.84 --> 580.94]  But the question still remains,
[581.90 --> 583.36]  do we know God's concern
[583.36 --> 583.98]  for our city?
[584.50 --> 585.98]  And do we share
[585.98 --> 587.86]  God's concern for the city?
[589.22 --> 590.36]  Pastor Sid told me a story
[590.36 --> 591.12]  not that long ago
[591.12 --> 591.94]  of a group of pastors
[591.94 --> 592.40]  from the city
[592.40 --> 593.22]  gathering together,
[593.74 --> 594.36]  praying for the city,
[594.48 --> 595.18]  praying for each other.
[595.42 --> 596.20]  And one of the pastors
[596.20 --> 597.24]  very honestly
[597.24 --> 598.68]  and transparently
[598.68 --> 599.62]  started his prayer
[599.62 --> 601.08]  with this confession.
[601.34 --> 602.60]  He said in his prayer,
[602.60 --> 605.08]  Lord, forgive me
[605.08 --> 607.46]  because I don't give a rip
[607.46 --> 608.62]  about this city.
[609.48 --> 610.24]  And I wonder
[610.24 --> 611.56]  if that prayer
[611.56 --> 612.40]  honestly reflects
[612.40 --> 613.04]  not just the heart
[613.04 --> 613.64]  of that pastor
[613.64 --> 615.24]  but most Christians
[615.24 --> 616.62]  in most cities.
[617.38 --> 618.08]  I wonder if that's
[618.08 --> 619.02]  the honest confession
[619.02 --> 619.96]  that we should be praying
[619.96 --> 620.92]  as we read a book
[620.92 --> 621.84]  like Jonah.
[622.82 --> 623.54]  And it's worth,
[623.70 --> 624.06]  by the way,
[624.24 --> 624.88]  for me to now,
[624.96 --> 625.44]  for this moment,
[625.52 --> 626.56]  come back to our posters,
[626.80 --> 627.30]  these banners.
[627.82 --> 628.40]  And John Mayhew,
[628.42 --> 628.82]  are you here?
[628.92 --> 629.92]  You weren't in the 9 a.m. service.
[629.92 --> 632.52]  Where are you?
[632.56 --> 632.88]  Where are you?
[633.04 --> 634.22]  John made these posters.
[634.46 --> 635.14]  Thank you, John.
[635.34 --> 636.28]  And I want to point out
[636.28 --> 637.20]  to you some cool nuances.
[637.34 --> 637.84]  Number one,
[638.24 --> 639.10]  it's designed so that
[639.10 --> 640.54]  the bottom of these cities
[640.54 --> 642.34]  represent an archaic city
[642.34 --> 643.14]  like Nineveh
[643.14 --> 644.62]  and the top of the art
[644.62 --> 645.96]  represents the modern city
[645.96 --> 647.20]  as a way of saying,
[647.52 --> 648.30]  what's our relationship
[648.30 --> 649.00]  with our city?
[649.30 --> 649.78]  And I don't know
[649.78 --> 650.60]  if John designed this.
[650.68 --> 651.36]  He can correct me
[651.36 --> 651.88]  if I'm wrong.
[652.76 --> 654.06]  The posture of Jonah,
[654.40 --> 655.18]  see that little man there
[655.18 --> 655.76]  if you can see it
[655.76 --> 656.30]  from way back?
[656.78 --> 657.52]  He's sort of holding
[657.52 --> 658.34]  up his hands
[658.34 --> 659.62]  and it leads to
[659.62 --> 660.26]  the curious question,
[660.34 --> 661.70]  is he excited about this?
[661.82 --> 662.94]  Is he happy to be here?
[663.00 --> 663.68]  Is he frustrated?
[663.82 --> 665.14]  Does he have his arms up at God
[665.14 --> 666.24]  because he doesn't love this city?
[666.40 --> 667.36]  It invites the question,
[667.48 --> 668.36]  what is our posture
[668.36 --> 669.82]  towards the city?
[669.86 --> 670.28]  And I don't think
[670.28 --> 671.20]  we ask that question enough.
[671.32 --> 672.48]  What is our posture
[672.48 --> 674.90]  towards the city?
[675.90 --> 676.52]  And I want to name
[676.52 --> 677.90]  two temptations, okay?
[677.94 --> 679.18]  There's two specific temptations
[679.18 --> 679.92]  that I think faces
[679.92 --> 680.90]  every church
[680.90 --> 682.92]  living within Nineveh
[682.92 --> 683.56]  as we do
[683.56 --> 684.74]  in our secular society
[684.74 --> 685.50]  in Surrey, Langley,
[685.54 --> 686.04]  and beyond.
[686.56 --> 687.76]  The first temptation
[687.76 --> 689.20]  is to go the way
[689.20 --> 689.58]  of Jonah.
[690.18 --> 691.24]  It's to go the way
[691.24 --> 692.42]  of anger and hatred
[692.42 --> 693.86]  towards your pagan city.
[694.74 --> 695.28]  It's saying,
[695.42 --> 695.94]  I don't want anything
[695.94 --> 697.18]  to do with the wickedness
[697.18 --> 697.72]  that's around me.
[697.80 --> 698.26]  I don't want to be
[698.26 --> 699.04]  associated with it.
[699.08 --> 699.92]  I don't want to see it.
[700.16 --> 701.98]  I'm so turned off
[701.98 --> 703.24]  by how secular
[703.24 --> 704.12]  this city is.
[705.26 --> 705.90]  And perhaps you think,
[705.96 --> 706.24]  oh man,
[706.28 --> 707.02]  I'm not like Jonah.
[707.08 --> 707.56]  I'm Canadian.
[707.68 --> 708.20]  We're tolerant.
[708.34 --> 709.56]  We don't say these strong things.
[709.80 --> 710.62]  But let me ask you
[710.62 --> 711.22]  just a series
[711.22 --> 712.48]  of diagnostic questions
[712.48 --> 713.26]  to get you thinking
[713.26 --> 713.86]  about this.
[714.36 --> 715.12]  Perhaps it's true.
[715.66 --> 716.52]  You would never think
[716.52 --> 717.22]  that you hate a city.
[717.28 --> 717.80]  But let me ask you,
[717.84 --> 718.60]  how do you talk
[718.60 --> 719.94]  about your city?
[720.00 --> 720.44]  How do you talk
[720.44 --> 722.16]  about Surrey and Langley,
[722.62 --> 723.16]  the community
[723.16 --> 723.84]  in which you live?
[724.76 --> 725.68]  What words do you use
[725.68 --> 726.22]  to describe it
[726.22 --> 726.98]  when you're with your friends
[726.98 --> 727.72]  and you're just saying
[727.72 --> 728.48]  what you really feel?
[728.54 --> 729.32]  How do you describe
[729.32 --> 729.78]  your city?
[731.30 --> 731.66]  Or,
[732.54 --> 733.30]  how do you relate
[733.30 --> 734.24]  to your coworkers
[734.24 --> 734.98]  and your neighbors
[734.98 --> 735.80]  who are very much
[735.80 --> 736.36]  not like you
[736.36 --> 737.10]  and who do not share
[737.10 --> 737.66]  your beliefs?
[739.04 --> 740.44]  Would you build friendship,
[740.86 --> 741.82]  real friendship,
[742.28 --> 742.84]  with people
[742.84 --> 743.96]  who are not believers?
[745.68 --> 746.54]  Do we live,
[746.68 --> 747.60]  perhaps not with hatred,
[748.02 --> 749.08]  but with an alarming
[749.08 --> 750.16]  sense of indifference
[750.16 --> 751.52]  and, I would say,
[751.82 --> 753.16]  a low concern
[753.16 --> 754.42]  for the city,
[754.72 --> 755.40]  its well-being,
[755.50 --> 755.94]  its goodness,
[756.18 --> 756.88]  where it goes,
[756.96 --> 757.62]  what's going to happen
[757.62 --> 758.24]  with its leaders?
[758.34 --> 760.00]  Do we share a concern?
[761.08 --> 761.70]  And I would say
[761.70 --> 762.62]  there's a lot of Christians
[762.62 --> 764.22]  in a lot of churches
[764.22 --> 766.18]  who just put their heads down
[766.18 --> 766.46]  and say,
[766.56 --> 767.26]  let's just worry about
[767.26 --> 767.70]  what's happening
[767.70 --> 768.48]  inside these walls.
[768.58 --> 769.60]  Let's do our religious thing
[769.60 --> 770.80]  and let whatever happens
[770.80 --> 771.30]  in the city
[771.30 --> 772.30]  happen to the city
[772.30 --> 772.94]  and we'll just do
[772.94 --> 773.84]  our own religious thing
[773.84 --> 774.80]  within the four walls
[774.80 --> 775.40]  of the church.
[776.40 --> 777.44]  I think there's a lot
[777.44 --> 778.00]  of temptation
[778.00 --> 779.30]  to do that.
[781.26 --> 782.00]  And I want to say
[782.00 --> 782.80]  there's one indicator,
[783.12 --> 784.00]  this one gets close to home
[784.00 --> 784.48]  for every church,
[784.54 --> 785.14]  but I'm going to say it,
[785.32 --> 786.78]  one indicator to show
[786.78 --> 787.96]  how much you love your city
[787.96 --> 788.66]  is your money,
[789.04 --> 789.64]  both individually
[789.64 --> 790.14]  and collectively
[790.14 --> 790.86]  for the church.
[791.28 --> 792.64]  And there's a lot of stats
[792.64 --> 793.70]  and scathing critiques
[793.70 --> 794.12]  of the church
[794.12 --> 794.44]  that's saying,
[794.54 --> 795.54]  you say you care about the city,
[795.68 --> 796.64]  you don't give any money
[796.64 --> 797.18]  to the city,
[797.46 --> 798.56]  you're not getting behind
[798.56 --> 799.36]  any of the causes,
[799.68 --> 800.52]  you don't care about the poor,
[800.62 --> 801.50]  there's nothing you do
[801.50 --> 802.78]  in your church financially
[802.78 --> 803.42]  that shows you care
[803.42 --> 803.90]  about your city,
[804.18 --> 805.74]  prove it with how you spend
[805.74 --> 806.42]  your money as a church.
[806.50 --> 808.08]  And I love that challenge.
[808.90 --> 810.18]  In fact, last year in November,
[810.46 --> 811.50]  I was at the independent grocer
[811.50 --> 812.86]  doing some last minute shopping
[812.86 --> 814.54]  and I got a call out of the blue
[814.54 --> 815.52]  from someone in our church
[815.52 --> 817.48]  and they just finished a book
[817.48 --> 818.74]  on justice and mercy
[818.74 --> 819.64]  and caring for the poor
[819.64 --> 820.44]  and they called me
[820.44 --> 820.96]  to say,
[821.06 --> 822.58]  hey, I read this book,
[822.88 --> 823.74]  I have these concerns,
[823.84 --> 824.32]  I want to know
[824.32 --> 825.84]  how does hope spend its money?
[826.00 --> 827.08]  Like what are we getting behind?
[827.16 --> 827.88]  Where are we spending it?
[828.16 --> 830.28]  And I was so delighted
[830.28 --> 831.32]  to get that phone call.
[832.00 --> 833.36]  So delighted to have someone
[833.36 --> 834.30]  who concerned themselves
[834.30 --> 835.44]  with the needs of the city
[835.44 --> 836.02]  such that they're like,
[836.06 --> 836.98]  I'm just going to call the pastor
[836.98 --> 837.72]  and ask,
[837.82 --> 838.72]  where is our money going?
[839.48 --> 840.18]  And I want you to know
[840.18 --> 840.80]  that as a church,
[840.88 --> 841.86]  we seek to give more
[841.86 --> 843.84]  and more and more
[843.84 --> 845.52]  to the needs of our city
[845.52 --> 846.36]  because we believe
[846.36 --> 848.02]  we're called to do that.
[848.98 --> 850.70]  And I pray that as many
[850.70 --> 851.70]  of our younger people grow up,
[851.76 --> 852.92]  they have just the same concerns
[852.92 --> 853.56]  as our leaders now
[853.56 --> 853.82]  to say,
[853.88 --> 854.70]  how can we give?
[855.38 --> 856.32]  What can we get behind?
[856.42 --> 857.20]  Who can we partner with?
[857.20 --> 858.56]  What can we give away
[858.56 --> 860.38]  because we are so concerned
[860.38 --> 861.52]  with the life of Clayton
[861.52 --> 862.52]  and Cloverdale
[862.52 --> 863.76]  and Surrey and beyond?
[865.56 --> 866.62]  That's the one temptation,
[867.20 --> 867.96]  the way of Jonah,
[868.06 --> 868.80]  the way of anger,
[868.92 --> 869.66]  the way of disdain,
[869.80 --> 871.08]  separation, and hatred.
[871.82 --> 873.20]  But there's another concern,
[873.46 --> 874.16]  another temptation,
[874.30 --> 874.78]  I should say,
[874.92 --> 875.86]  that's totally different.
[875.94 --> 876.62]  You know what it is?
[877.50 --> 878.58]  It's the way of Nineveh.
[879.90 --> 881.52]  It's the chameleon church,
[881.98 --> 883.06]  the church that says,
[883.24 --> 883.86]  go with the flow,
[884.04 --> 884.84]  status quo,
[885.00 --> 885.92]  don't stick your neck out,
[885.92 --> 887.28]  don't worry about the differences,
[887.70 --> 888.92]  just enjoy the gift
[888.92 --> 889.98]  of living in the city.
[890.24 --> 891.10]  And this is a church
[891.10 --> 892.40]  where the values,
[892.76 --> 893.28]  the ambitions,
[893.64 --> 894.28]  the desires,
[894.54 --> 896.06]  the hopes of Christians
[896.06 --> 897.30]  looks a whole lot
[897.30 --> 898.28]  like everybody else.
[898.62 --> 899.52]  So much so that you could
[899.52 --> 900.10]  look at the church
[900.10 --> 900.34]  and say,
[900.40 --> 900.48]  well,
[900.52 --> 901.58]  what's really the difference?
[902.00 --> 902.76]  They're doing the same thing
[902.76 --> 903.28]  as everyone else,
[903.34 --> 903.66]  they're pursuing
[903.66 --> 904.34]  all the same things.
[904.52 --> 906.04]  There is nothing distinct
[906.04 --> 907.82]  about the church.
[907.94 --> 908.82]  They have fit in,
[908.90 --> 909.74]  have been compromised,
[909.74 --> 912.32]  and absorbed by Nineveh.
[913.10 --> 913.42]  And you know,
[913.46 --> 914.48]  I'll just be transparent with you.
[914.98 --> 916.30]  I wasn't asking this question
[916.30 --> 916.70]  at the beginning
[916.70 --> 917.58]  of this sermon series,
[917.86 --> 918.54]  but the question
[918.54 --> 919.20]  that's been in me
[919.20 --> 920.30]  this week especially is,
[920.56 --> 921.28]  is the church,
[921.46 --> 922.54]  our church today,
[922.78 --> 923.56]  more tempted
[923.56 --> 924.60]  to go the way of Jonah
[924.60 --> 926.32]  or is it more tempted
[926.32 --> 927.36]  to go the way of Nineveh?
[928.14 --> 928.88]  What do you think?
[929.92 --> 930.98]  Bring it to your small groups.
[931.74 --> 932.38]  Are we more tempted
[932.38 --> 933.40]  to live with distance
[933.40 --> 934.46]  and hate towards the city
[934.46 --> 935.06]  or more tempted
[935.06 --> 936.14]  just to let it go,
[936.58 --> 937.72]  go with the flow?
[937.96 --> 939.18]  Who cares about the differences?
[939.18 --> 940.32]  We just want to enjoy
[940.32 --> 941.50]  our time in this place.
[943.52 --> 944.02]  You know,
[944.20 --> 944.74]  a number of people
[944.74 --> 945.56]  who joined our church
[945.56 --> 947.78]  from other continents
[947.78 --> 948.38]  particularly,
[948.68 --> 949.52]  whether it be Latin America,
[949.88 --> 950.72]  Asia, Africa,
[951.22 --> 952.06]  and they join in,
[952.18 --> 952.88]  they often will,
[953.06 --> 953.98]  if they get the courage,
[954.08 --> 954.86]  they'll talk to me
[954.86 --> 955.76]  and they'll say
[955.76 --> 956.38]  how they feel
[956.38 --> 957.24]  about the Western church
[957.24 --> 958.14]  in one way or another
[958.14 --> 958.84]  and I've noticed
[958.84 --> 960.68]  that they have some questions
[960.68 --> 962.26]  about the Nineveh
[962.26 --> 962.96]  within the church,
[963.04 --> 963.48]  so to speak.
[963.54 --> 963.90]  And they'll say,
[963.96 --> 964.24]  you know,
[964.80 --> 965.64]  Christians in Canada
[965.64 --> 966.20]  have a hard time
[966.20 --> 966.90]  standing up
[966.90 --> 967.58]  for what they believe.
[968.42 --> 968.92]  They have a hard time
[968.92 --> 970.38]  really speaking their faith.
[971.28 --> 972.22]  Christians in Canada
[972.22 --> 973.58]  have a hard time
[973.58 --> 974.80]  resisting the idols
[974.80 --> 975.76]  of consumerism,
[975.86 --> 976.60]  individualism,
[976.68 --> 977.04]  and greed,
[977.14 --> 977.76]  and all the rest.
[977.82 --> 978.44]  They seem to just be
[978.44 --> 979.10]  really comfortable
[979.10 --> 979.72]  with those idols.
[980.16 --> 980.72]  And another one,
[980.78 --> 981.40]  and I've heard this one
[981.40 --> 981.90]  a bunch,
[982.40 --> 983.20]  especially from people
[983.20 --> 984.00]  in other parts of the world,
[984.42 --> 985.14]  Christians in Canada
[985.14 --> 985.92]  feel like it's really
[985.92 --> 986.92]  not that important
[986.92 --> 987.96]  to gather for worship.
[988.76 --> 989.20]  They don't think
[989.20 --> 990.02]  it's really that big deal
[990.02 --> 990.84]  to go to church
[990.84 --> 991.38]  and you can sort of
[991.38 --> 991.76]  be a Christian
[991.76 --> 992.70]  and not have any affiliation
[992.70 --> 993.14]  with the church
[993.14 --> 994.06]  and they wonder
[994.06 --> 995.60]  why that is the case
[995.60 --> 996.44]  and I would suggest
[996.44 --> 997.38]  some of that reveals
[997.38 --> 998.00]  the temptation
[998.00 --> 999.30]  to go the way
[999.30 --> 1000.24]  of Nineveh.
[1002.28 --> 1003.82]  Let me say this though.
[1004.86 --> 1005.62]  There are blessings
[1005.62 --> 1006.46]  and curses
[1006.46 --> 1007.90]  with whichever temptation
[1007.90 --> 1009.24]  you are more prone towards.
[1009.82 --> 1010.62]  The people
[1010.62 --> 1011.74]  in our community
[1011.74 --> 1012.36]  and our church
[1012.36 --> 1013.42]  who might be more prone
[1013.42 --> 1014.22]  to frustration
[1014.22 --> 1014.78]  and anger
[1014.78 --> 1015.54]  with all the idols
[1015.54 --> 1016.10]  of our city,
[1016.46 --> 1017.30]  they are the ones
[1017.30 --> 1017.96]  who have their eyes
[1017.96 --> 1019.08]  open to them, right?
[1019.26 --> 1020.36]  They see the idols,
[1020.46 --> 1021.70]  they see the injustice,
[1021.90 --> 1022.66]  they see the violence,
[1022.78 --> 1023.72]  they see all the ways
[1023.72 --> 1024.26]  that our society
[1024.26 --> 1025.34]  has fallen away
[1025.34 --> 1026.22]  from God's design
[1026.22 --> 1026.66]  for the city
[1026.66 --> 1028.00]  and it burdens them,
[1028.06 --> 1028.68]  it angers them
[1028.68 --> 1029.16]  and there's something
[1029.16 --> 1030.56]  so right about that.
[1031.32 --> 1032.32]  Jonah was on to something
[1032.32 --> 1033.14]  with his frustration
[1033.14 --> 1033.80]  towards Nineveh.
[1033.90 --> 1036.10]  He saw the dehumanizing
[1036.10 --> 1037.44]  idols of that place
[1037.44 --> 1039.52]  and the people
[1039.52 --> 1040.68]  who are more prone
[1040.68 --> 1041.48]  to blend in
[1041.48 --> 1042.14]  with society
[1042.14 --> 1043.84]  are far more likely
[1043.84 --> 1044.90]  to see the good
[1044.90 --> 1045.96]  of a city
[1045.96 --> 1047.52]  and let me just say
[1047.52 --> 1048.18]  unequivocally,
[1048.42 --> 1049.34]  every city
[1049.34 --> 1051.10]  has a lot
[1051.10 --> 1052.28]  of good
[1052.28 --> 1054.10]  and it breaks my heart
[1054.10 --> 1054.70]  that churches
[1054.70 --> 1056.04]  are often not known
[1056.04 --> 1056.64]  for celebrating
[1056.64 --> 1057.64]  anything in the city.
[1057.74 --> 1058.16]  They sort of
[1058.16 --> 1059.04]  can't say anything
[1059.04 --> 1060.74]  but denouncing culture
[1060.74 --> 1061.52]  and getting frustrated
[1061.52 --> 1061.92]  by it
[1061.92 --> 1062.60]  and they're blind
[1062.60 --> 1063.56]  to the beauty
[1063.56 --> 1064.36]  and the goodness
[1064.36 --> 1065.40]  and the good stuff
[1065.40 --> 1065.90]  that's happening
[1065.90 --> 1066.30]  in the city
[1066.30 --> 1066.98]  by Christians
[1066.98 --> 1067.80]  and non-Christians
[1067.80 --> 1068.30]  alike.
[1070.00 --> 1071.18]  Even between the services
[1071.18 --> 1071.78]  I had some people
[1071.78 --> 1072.32]  sharing with me
[1072.32 --> 1072.74]  all the things
[1072.74 --> 1073.88]  they love about Surrey.
[1076.76 --> 1078.12]  Shin-hee and I,
[1078.24 --> 1079.22]  Shin-hee is a Korean,
[1079.42 --> 1080.36]  he actually plays bass
[1080.36 --> 1081.30]  on one of our worship teams,
[1081.30 --> 1082.24]  he's in our surge group
[1082.24 --> 1083.16]  and he and I
[1083.16 --> 1084.14]  have an ongoing debate.
[1084.26 --> 1084.38]  You see,
[1084.46 --> 1085.04]  Shin-hee moved
[1085.04 --> 1085.66]  a year ago
[1085.66 --> 1086.64]  from Korea to Canada
[1086.64 --> 1087.52]  and he is just
[1087.52 --> 1088.30]  loving Canada.
[1088.50 --> 1089.22]  Are you here, Shin-hee?
[1089.98 --> 1090.68]  Somewhere around here?
[1091.08 --> 1092.02]  And I'm always saying,
[1092.12 --> 1092.58]  oh, Shin-hee,
[1092.64 --> 1093.22]  you've got to be aware
[1093.22 --> 1093.68]  of the idols,
[1093.80 --> 1094.48]  they're serious here,
[1094.56 --> 1095.64]  like it's very insidious
[1095.64 --> 1096.34]  and he's just like,
[1096.38 --> 1096.88]  oh, Dave,
[1096.94 --> 1097.82]  it's way worse than Korea
[1097.82 --> 1098.68]  and I love being in Canada
[1098.68 --> 1099.62]  and we go back and forth
[1099.62 --> 1100.24]  and I realize
[1100.24 --> 1102.20]  you need to counterbalance
[1102.20 --> 1103.60]  and correct one another.
[1104.20 --> 1105.14]  And I do think
[1105.14 --> 1106.48]  what is needed
[1106.48 --> 1107.16]  for the church,
[1107.30 --> 1108.38]  and this isn't my insight,
[1109.24 --> 1109.74]  what is needed
[1109.74 --> 1110.40]  for the church
[1110.40 --> 1111.28]  is a sense
[1111.28 --> 1112.72]  of solidarity
[1112.72 --> 1114.64]  and separation.
[1115.26 --> 1115.76]  Leslie Newbigin,
[1115.80 --> 1116.52]  one of my favorite writers,
[1116.60 --> 1116.76]  says,
[1116.90 --> 1117.72]  every faithful church
[1117.72 --> 1118.76]  must live with a sense
[1118.76 --> 1119.50]  of solidarity
[1119.50 --> 1120.82]  with that which is good
[1120.82 --> 1121.66]  in a city
[1121.66 --> 1122.92]  and celebrate it
[1122.92 --> 1124.00]  and it must live
[1124.00 --> 1125.74]  with a distinct resistance
[1125.74 --> 1126.38]  and lament
[1126.38 --> 1127.56]  and grief over
[1127.56 --> 1129.80]  that which is idolatrous.
[1130.48 --> 1131.32]  And a faithful church
[1131.32 --> 1132.46]  will always be celebrating
[1132.46 --> 1133.22]  and resisting
[1133.22 --> 1134.28]  at the same time.
[1134.64 --> 1135.42]  It's hard to do.
[1136.02 --> 1137.60]  And I wrote just a very short list
[1137.60 --> 1138.72]  of things that came to mind
[1138.72 --> 1139.82]  when I think of the good
[1139.82 --> 1140.44]  in our city
[1140.44 --> 1140.86]  and some people
[1140.86 --> 1141.52]  between the services
[1141.52 --> 1142.24]  added to my list
[1142.24 --> 1143.82]  but I praise the Lord
[1143.82 --> 1144.90]  that we live in a city
[1144.90 --> 1147.28]  where everyone has access
[1147.28 --> 1148.40]  to medical care.
[1149.20 --> 1149.94]  That is just a gift
[1149.94 --> 1150.48]  from the Lord.
[1150.74 --> 1151.66]  Praise the Lord for it.
[1151.68 --> 1152.20]  And those who come
[1152.20 --> 1152.74]  from other places
[1152.74 --> 1153.04]  in the world,
[1153.24 --> 1154.00]  they always remind me
[1154.00 --> 1155.42]  of how beautiful it is
[1155.42 --> 1156.82]  that we have universal medical care.
[1156.94 --> 1157.84]  Yes, it's got its problems
[1157.84 --> 1158.74]  but it is a gift.
[1159.74 --> 1160.66]  We praise the Lord
[1160.66 --> 1161.52]  that every kid
[1161.52 --> 1162.78]  has access to education.
[1163.46 --> 1164.52]  That is a gift from the Lord.
[1165.28 --> 1166.54]  We should praise the Lord daily
[1166.54 --> 1167.66]  that you flick on your tap,
[1167.84 --> 1168.68]  you have some of the best
[1168.68 --> 1170.34]  tap water in the world.
[1171.12 --> 1172.08]  Tap water that I'm told
[1172.08 --> 1173.36]  rivals bottled water.
[1173.48 --> 1174.52]  Like that's in our taps.
[1174.86 --> 1175.78]  Praise the Lord for that.
[1176.52 --> 1177.06]  And this morning
[1177.06 --> 1178.10]  when we had two baptisms
[1178.10 --> 1178.66]  and two moms
[1178.66 --> 1179.52]  who are at home with babies,
[1179.88 --> 1181.06]  we stopped to praise the Lord
[1181.06 --> 1182.02]  for the fact that in Canada
[1182.02 --> 1182.76]  and our cities,
[1182.98 --> 1183.80]  when you have a baby,
[1183.88 --> 1184.82]  you can have a whole year
[1184.82 --> 1186.00]  of paid maternity leave
[1186.00 --> 1187.50]  and not lose your job.
[1188.28 --> 1189.44]  Praise the Lord for that.
[1189.98 --> 1190.78]  Between the services,
[1190.92 --> 1191.38]  someone mentioned
[1191.38 --> 1192.40]  Black Tiger Coffee,
[1192.82 --> 1193.62]  Bang Chok Di,
[1193.62 --> 1194.62]  Thai cuisine,
[1195.18 --> 1195.88]  Chef's Kebab,
[1196.04 --> 1196.56]  Indian cuisine
[1196.56 --> 1197.76]  and so many more parts
[1197.76 --> 1198.18]  of our city
[1198.18 --> 1199.20]  that we love
[1199.20 --> 1200.70]  and enjoy and should
[1200.70 --> 1202.56]  because these are good parts
[1202.56 --> 1203.10]  of our city.
[1204.48 --> 1204.96]  However,
[1205.48 --> 1206.38]  as we stand
[1206.38 --> 1207.56]  and celebrate in solidarity
[1207.56 --> 1208.46]  with that which is good,
[1208.54 --> 1209.16]  we resist
[1209.16 --> 1210.70]  that which is the idol.
[1211.86 --> 1212.42]  And the ones
[1212.42 --> 1213.12]  that I wrote down
[1213.12 --> 1213.92]  and there could be more
[1213.92 --> 1214.64]  I add to this list,
[1214.74 --> 1215.82]  one is the radical,
[1216.50 --> 1218.52]  blatant selfishness
[1218.52 --> 1221.22]  that runs through our city.
[1222.22 --> 1223.18]  That preoccupation
[1223.18 --> 1223.68]  with self
[1223.68 --> 1224.90]  and complete disregard
[1224.90 --> 1225.64]  for one's neighbor,
[1225.88 --> 1226.36]  one's friend,
[1226.48 --> 1227.50]  one's person around the corner
[1227.50 --> 1227.98]  in need.
[1228.66 --> 1230.96]  The unbridled greed.
[1231.98 --> 1232.16]  You know,
[1232.20 --> 1232.94]  we've had friends visit
[1232.94 --> 1233.58]  from other places
[1233.58 --> 1234.20]  and they can't help
[1234.20 --> 1234.54]  but notice
[1234.54 --> 1235.98]  the monstrous homes
[1235.98 --> 1237.24]  in our city.
[1237.30 --> 1237.72]  And I'm not saying
[1237.72 --> 1238.56]  everyone who has a big house
[1238.56 --> 1238.96]  is greedy,
[1239.08 --> 1239.72]  but there's some
[1239.72 --> 1241.16]  incredible difference
[1241.16 --> 1241.86]  between the wealthy
[1241.86 --> 1242.62]  and the poor in our cities
[1242.62 --> 1243.58]  and we just need to name that.
[1244.22 --> 1245.32]  There's something wrong there.
[1245.32 --> 1248.40]  How about this one?
[1249.58 --> 1251.20]  The addiction to technology
[1251.20 --> 1254.12]  that is dehumanizing all of us
[1254.12 --> 1256.06]  and leading to unbelievable
[1256.06 --> 1257.16]  mental health challenges.
[1257.88 --> 1259.08]  Our inability to get away
[1259.08 --> 1259.64]  from the screen
[1259.64 --> 1260.82]  and be present in relationship.
[1262.08 --> 1262.78]  How about this one?
[1262.84 --> 1263.66]  The pornification,
[1263.86 --> 1265.50]  the normalization of pornography
[1265.50 --> 1266.88]  throughout society.
[1267.16 --> 1268.70]  It's no longer considered bad,
[1268.74 --> 1269.52]  it's just what you do.
[1270.10 --> 1270.88]  And that destroys
[1270.88 --> 1271.70]  not just marriages,
[1271.84 --> 1272.46]  not just families,
[1272.46 --> 1273.24]  but kids,
[1273.38 --> 1274.08]  our children,
[1274.50 --> 1275.20]  are growing up
[1275.20 --> 1276.82]  in what a non-believing writer
[1276.82 --> 1277.42]  describes as
[1277.42 --> 1279.08]  a pornified society.
[1280.00 --> 1281.66]  We grieve and lament
[1281.66 --> 1283.26]  and resist that reality.
[1285.36 --> 1286.34]  How about this?
[1287.40 --> 1288.82]  The legislation of abortion
[1288.82 --> 1289.82]  and euthanasia.
[1290.88 --> 1291.56]  The ending life
[1291.56 --> 1292.24]  of the unborn
[1292.24 --> 1293.02]  and the elderly.
[1293.88 --> 1295.26]  We grieve and lament.
[1296.14 --> 1296.78]  And as a church
[1296.78 --> 1297.58]  of Jesus Christ,
[1297.68 --> 1298.92]  we stand in celebration
[1298.92 --> 1299.90]  with that which is good
[1299.90 --> 1301.54]  and we resist the idols.
[1302.32 --> 1302.86]  Leslie Newbigin,
[1302.92 --> 1303.40]  who talks about
[1303.40 --> 1304.34]  the solidarity with
[1304.34 --> 1305.30]  and the separation from,
[1305.66 --> 1306.00]  he says,
[1306.10 --> 1307.64]  the church must be the place
[1307.64 --> 1309.18]  that loves a city
[1309.18 --> 1310.14]  so deeply,
[1310.68 --> 1311.58]  so deeply
[1311.58 --> 1313.04]  that it can't stand
[1313.04 --> 1313.98]  the presence of idols.
[1314.88 --> 1315.50]  And imagine,
[1315.60 --> 1316.82]  the church were known first
[1316.82 --> 1318.38]  for all the ways
[1318.38 --> 1319.04]  it celebrates
[1319.04 --> 1319.70]  the good of a city
[1319.70 --> 1320.74]  and then its resistance
[1320.74 --> 1322.34]  was because its love
[1322.34 --> 1323.22]  was greater
[1323.22 --> 1324.60]  than everybody else
[1324.60 --> 1325.62]  because they saw
[1325.62 --> 1326.72]  and have an imagination
[1326.72 --> 1327.50]  for the way
[1327.50 --> 1329.16]  God designed cities to be.
[1330.04 --> 1330.98]  That's the church.
[1332.16 --> 1333.48]  And if the early church
[1333.48 --> 1334.34]  is a barometer
[1334.34 --> 1337.00]  of what a healthy engagement
[1337.00 --> 1338.02]  with cultural life
[1338.02 --> 1338.56]  should be,
[1339.26 --> 1340.30]  I think it's fair to say,
[1340.36 --> 1341.26]  and this comes from Tim Keller,
[1341.64 --> 1342.12]  that the church
[1342.12 --> 1343.02]  at every point in history
[1343.02 --> 1343.66]  and every culture
[1343.66 --> 1345.12]  will probably be praised
[1345.12 --> 1346.04]  for some things
[1346.04 --> 1347.72]  and persecuted for others.
[1348.46 --> 1349.54]  It will be affirmed
[1349.54 --> 1350.16]  and applauded
[1350.16 --> 1350.70]  for some things
[1350.70 --> 1351.26]  and criticized
[1351.26 --> 1353.16]  and mocked for others.
[1353.68 --> 1354.60]  I think of the early church
[1354.60 --> 1355.42]  care for the margins.
[1355.54 --> 1356.88]  They were so good
[1356.88 --> 1358.50]  at taking care of the poor,
[1358.60 --> 1358.94]  the widows,
[1358.94 --> 1359.40]  and the orphans.
[1359.46 --> 1359.68]  In fact,
[1359.72 --> 1360.70]  I remember reading a story
[1360.70 --> 1361.12]  in a book
[1361.12 --> 1362.58]  about how some of the homes
[1362.58 --> 1363.32]  in which they'd worship,
[1363.80 --> 1365.28]  half of the space
[1365.28 --> 1366.42]  in that home
[1366.42 --> 1367.56]  was to collect
[1367.56 --> 1368.38]  all the needs
[1368.38 --> 1369.36]  for those who were homeless
[1369.36 --> 1370.22]  and didn't have food
[1370.22 --> 1371.04]  and they would give
[1371.04 --> 1371.90]  all that stuff away
[1371.90 --> 1372.70]  to those who were in need.
[1372.78 --> 1373.24]  But imagine,
[1373.54 --> 1374.68]  walking into a worship space
[1374.68 --> 1375.78]  and half of it
[1375.78 --> 1377.36]  was gathering things
[1377.36 --> 1378.22]  for those in need.
[1378.28 --> 1379.16]  The church had such
[1379.16 --> 1379.90]  a good reputation
[1379.90 --> 1381.18]  for caring for the widows,
[1381.28 --> 1381.72]  the orphans,
[1381.78 --> 1382.24]  and the poor.
[1382.92 --> 1383.62]  But man,
[1383.62 --> 1384.42]  men were they mocked
[1384.42 --> 1385.84]  for their sexual ethic.
[1386.86 --> 1388.24]  Men were they made fun of
[1388.24 --> 1389.50]  for their new desire
[1389.50 --> 1390.50]  to be monogamous,
[1390.84 --> 1392.40]  to not go to the temple prostitutes,
[1392.46 --> 1393.16]  to not participate
[1393.16 --> 1393.84]  in wild,
[1394.04 --> 1394.68]  reckless living.
[1395.06 --> 1395.76]  And they lived
[1395.76 --> 1396.42]  with resistance.
[1397.22 --> 1398.06]  And don't miss this.
[1398.76 --> 1400.02]  They were killed
[1400.02 --> 1402.58]  for not giving homage
[1402.58 --> 1403.46]  and worship
[1403.46 --> 1404.22]  to the Caesar.
[1404.86 --> 1406.04]  They refused to say
[1406.04 --> 1406.96]  that Caesar is Lord
[1406.96 --> 1407.68]  because the Lord
[1407.68 --> 1408.56]  was Jesus Christ
[1408.56 --> 1410.96]  and they went to death
[1410.96 --> 1412.56]  for that commitment,
[1412.56 --> 1414.06]  for that resistance,
[1414.58 --> 1415.48]  for that faithfulness.
[1415.54 --> 1416.22]  They put their stake
[1416.22 --> 1416.88]  in Jesus and said,
[1417.14 --> 1418.56]  we will not worship Caesar.
[1419.54 --> 1420.60]  We will worship Jesus Christ.
[1420.70 --> 1421.04]  And today,
[1421.14 --> 1421.74]  it seems to me
[1421.74 --> 1423.06]  that the new resistance is
[1423.06 --> 1425.00]  we will not worship the self.
[1425.70 --> 1427.30]  We will not idolize ourselves
[1427.30 --> 1428.10]  and what we think
[1428.10 --> 1428.60]  in the individual.
[1428.72 --> 1429.90]  We will worship Jesus Christ.
[1430.10 --> 1430.96]  And even that
[1430.96 --> 1432.32]  will cause some hot water
[1432.32 --> 1433.46]  in today's society.
[1435.66 --> 1436.40]  The church,
[1436.70 --> 1437.04]  I believe,
[1437.12 --> 1437.86]  when it's faithful,
[1438.46 --> 1439.50]  in every Nineveh,
[1439.58 --> 1440.58]  whether it's Surrey, Langley,
[1440.64 --> 1441.64]  or wherever you grow up
[1441.64 --> 1442.34]  and live now,
[1442.56 --> 1443.54]  the church is called
[1443.54 --> 1444.74]  to be an outpost
[1444.74 --> 1446.24]  of flourishing.
[1447.42 --> 1448.68]  A community where there is
[1448.68 --> 1450.70]  love and grace and power.
[1450.84 --> 1451.90]  A community that even
[1451.90 --> 1452.98]  in Nineveh
[1452.98 --> 1454.74]  can give blessing.
[1456.06 --> 1457.02]  And that, to be honest,
[1457.08 --> 1457.58]  is what Jonah
[1457.58 --> 1459.22]  could not even fathom.
[1459.70 --> 1460.76]  Jonah could never imagine
[1460.76 --> 1461.92]  that God's design
[1461.92 --> 1462.96]  was to not just have
[1462.96 --> 1464.04]  a religious community here
[1464.04 --> 1464.74]  and they resisted
[1464.74 --> 1465.92]  the other nations over there,
[1466.02 --> 1467.16]  but that he would plant
[1467.16 --> 1468.44]  communities of believers
[1468.44 --> 1469.22]  in every city
[1469.22 --> 1470.46]  all over the world
[1470.46 --> 1471.98]  and that those little churches
[1471.98 --> 1473.64]  would be the place
[1473.64 --> 1475.06]  of blessing for the city.
[1475.42 --> 1475.94]  That they would invite
[1475.94 --> 1476.68]  the whole world
[1476.68 --> 1477.56]  into a new life
[1477.56 --> 1478.32]  that comes in the rule
[1478.32 --> 1479.76]  of Jesus that is good.
[1480.14 --> 1481.46]  Where idols are cast away
[1481.46 --> 1482.76]  and life and flourishing
[1482.76 --> 1484.24]  happens through the power
[1484.24 --> 1484.84]  of the cross.
[1485.60 --> 1486.64]  That was God's design
[1486.64 --> 1487.34]  and Jonah could not
[1487.34 --> 1488.26]  even imagine
[1488.26 --> 1489.64]  God's design
[1489.64 --> 1491.04]  and what Christ would do
[1491.04 --> 1491.72]  in his church.
[1495.48 --> 1496.28]  Here's one of my
[1496.28 --> 1497.34]  closing convictions
[1497.34 --> 1499.08]  about the book of Jonah
[1499.08 --> 1499.98]  and about our relationship
[1499.98 --> 1500.60]  to the city.
[1501.84 --> 1503.06]  On our own strength,
[1503.54 --> 1504.76]  we will always go
[1504.76 --> 1505.44]  in one direction
[1505.44 --> 1505.90]  or the other.
[1506.00 --> 1507.08]  We will either become Jonah
[1507.08 --> 1507.96]  or we will become Nineveh.
[1508.04 --> 1509.18]  It's very hard for us
[1509.18 --> 1509.86]  in our own strength
[1509.86 --> 1511.06]  to live in both solidarity
[1511.06 --> 1512.16]  and separation.
[1512.62 --> 1513.22]  Something in us
[1513.22 --> 1514.36]  will cave in one direction
[1514.36 --> 1514.82]  or the other.
[1515.38 --> 1516.58]  You will start to hate the city
[1516.58 --> 1517.56]  or you will start
[1517.56 --> 1518.40]  to mirror the city.
[1518.40 --> 1519.72]  You will start to show
[1519.72 --> 1520.64]  a disdain for it
[1520.64 --> 1521.76]  or you'll just be absorbed
[1521.76 --> 1522.80]  by it.
[1522.86 --> 1523.50]  In our own strength,
[1523.56 --> 1524.30]  you will go one way
[1524.30 --> 1524.80]  or the other.
[1525.66 --> 1526.52]  And what is needed
[1526.52 --> 1528.06]  is a church
[1528.06 --> 1529.84]  that has the power
[1529.84 --> 1530.46]  of Jesus
[1530.46 --> 1532.12]  to follow in
[1532.12 --> 1533.30]  the way of Jesus.
[1534.12 --> 1535.32]  We have his strength
[1535.32 --> 1535.94]  and his power
[1535.94 --> 1536.64]  to do
[1536.64 --> 1538.52]  what he modeled for us.
[1539.26 --> 1539.46]  I mean,
[1539.50 --> 1540.54]  can I just talk for a minute
[1540.54 --> 1541.60]  about how Jesus
[1541.60 --> 1542.42]  is the model
[1542.42 --> 1543.08]  of separation
[1543.08 --> 1543.94]  and solidarity.
[1544.08 --> 1545.20]  How Jesus models
[1545.20 --> 1545.68]  this ability
[1545.68 --> 1546.94]  to love the good
[1546.94 --> 1547.78]  and resist
[1547.78 --> 1548.80]  that which dehumanizes.
[1550.06 --> 1550.76]  For example,
[1552.46 --> 1553.82]  Jesus' first miracle,
[1554.00 --> 1554.86]  John chapter 4,
[1554.94 --> 1555.74]  the wedding banquet
[1555.74 --> 1556.28]  at Cana.
[1556.54 --> 1557.28]  Who is the one
[1557.28 --> 1558.14]  who brings the wine
[1558.14 --> 1558.70]  to the party?
[1559.98 --> 1560.38]  Jesus.
[1561.18 --> 1561.94]  And he brings the wine
[1561.94 --> 1562.30]  to the party
[1562.30 --> 1563.00]  after all the wine
[1563.00 --> 1563.74]  that's already been had.
[1563.82 --> 1564.50]  You know what that means?
[1564.78 --> 1566.02]  He really wants people
[1566.02 --> 1566.84]  to celebrate,
[1567.00 --> 1568.16]  enjoy the gift of wine.
[1568.40 --> 1568.96]  What's happening?
[1569.74 --> 1571.16]  He is in solidarity,
[1571.68 --> 1572.16]  celebrating
[1572.16 --> 1572.98]  and enjoying
[1572.98 --> 1574.48]  and giving his blessing
[1574.48 --> 1575.40]  on marriage,
[1576.10 --> 1577.06]  on feasting
[1577.06 --> 1577.80]  over the goodness
[1577.80 --> 1578.96]  of people coming together
[1578.96 --> 1579.60]  in the gift
[1579.60 --> 1580.34]  that God designed
[1580.34 --> 1580.80]  that is marriage.
[1581.00 --> 1581.98]  This is solidarity.
[1582.62 --> 1583.18]  And I can't help
[1583.18 --> 1583.68]  but think Jesus
[1583.68 --> 1584.56]  was there celebrating
[1584.56 --> 1585.94]  and maybe even dancing
[1585.94 --> 1587.48]  in that feast.
[1588.54 --> 1589.14]  And yet,
[1589.20 --> 1590.34]  just a few chapters later,
[1591.26 --> 1592.70]  Jesus actually makes a whip
[1592.70 --> 1594.50]  and he thrashes Pharisees
[1594.50 --> 1595.28]  out of the temple.
[1595.44 --> 1595.72]  Why?
[1596.64 --> 1597.34]  Flips tables
[1597.34 --> 1598.06]  on the end.
[1598.14 --> 1598.40]  Why?
[1598.72 --> 1599.84]  Because these Pharisees
[1599.84 --> 1602.66]  are taxing the poor unjustly
[1602.66 --> 1604.20]  and Jesus will have none of it.
[1605.76 --> 1606.80]  This same Jesus,
[1607.52 --> 1608.92]  he dines with tax collectors,
[1609.04 --> 1609.84]  the most hated people
[1609.84 --> 1610.30]  in the city.
[1610.40 --> 1612.00]  He dines with outcasts,
[1612.14 --> 1612.82]  those who are sick
[1612.82 --> 1613.26]  and diseased.
[1613.50 --> 1615.32]  He protects prostitutes.
[1616.14 --> 1616.28]  I mean,
[1616.34 --> 1617.62]  talk about solidarity with
[1617.62 --> 1618.64]  and care for the vulnerable.
[1619.02 --> 1619.58]  And then he invites
[1619.58 --> 1620.66]  every single one
[1620.66 --> 1621.30]  of those groups
[1621.30 --> 1622.62]  to obedience,
[1623.12 --> 1623.46]  repentance,
[1624.12 --> 1624.68]  and faith.
[1625.62 --> 1626.62]  Jesus gathers together
[1626.62 --> 1627.14]  these Jews
[1627.14 --> 1627.80]  and these Gentiles.
[1627.80 --> 1628.60]  He teaches them
[1628.60 --> 1629.20]  in the Sermon on the Mount
[1629.20 --> 1630.52]  this totally new ethic
[1630.52 --> 1631.52]  for how they are to live
[1631.52 --> 1632.78]  that deals with their money,
[1632.90 --> 1633.78]  that deals with their tongue,
[1633.88 --> 1634.82]  that deals with how they speak
[1634.82 --> 1635.28]  and relate
[1635.28 --> 1636.20]  and live their lives.
[1636.24 --> 1636.46]  And he says,
[1636.74 --> 1637.64]  when you live this way,
[1637.70 --> 1638.70]  you follow in my ethic,
[1638.96 --> 1640.10]  you will not just experience
[1640.10 --> 1640.76]  the flourishing
[1640.76 --> 1641.74]  of the kingdom of God,
[1641.84 --> 1642.86]  but your city
[1642.86 --> 1644.44]  will be blessed
[1644.44 --> 1645.82]  even in the darkest corners
[1645.82 --> 1646.88]  as you learn
[1646.88 --> 1648.62]  to follow my lead.
[1649.82 --> 1650.68]  I hope even now
[1650.68 --> 1651.42]  you're getting a vision
[1651.42 --> 1652.04]  for what it looks like
[1652.04 --> 1652.44]  for the church
[1652.44 --> 1653.40]  to be that outpost
[1653.40 --> 1653.96]  of flourishing
[1653.96 --> 1655.24]  in our time
[1655.24 --> 1656.32]  in this place.
[1656.32 --> 1658.84]  But Jesus did not
[1658.84 --> 1659.82]  just talk about it
[1659.82 --> 1661.14]  or modeled it.
[1661.80 --> 1662.74]  He went to the cross
[1662.74 --> 1664.10]  and broke the power of sin
[1664.10 --> 1665.14]  so that we could live it.
[1666.40 --> 1667.20]  Jesus didn't finish
[1667.20 --> 1667.64]  with words,
[1667.72 --> 1668.80]  he finished with the cross.
[1668.92 --> 1669.54]  And on the cross
[1669.54 --> 1670.40]  is where he defeated
[1670.40 --> 1671.70]  our sinful desire
[1671.70 --> 1672.82]  to either hate the city
[1672.82 --> 1674.74]  or just become like the city.
[1675.18 --> 1676.06]  And he invited us
[1676.06 --> 1677.54]  to have his resurrection life,
[1677.62 --> 1678.62]  his resurrection power,
[1678.72 --> 1680.00]  so we can do the things
[1680.00 --> 1680.90]  that Jesus did.
[1680.90 --> 1683.42]  to live in solidarity
[1683.42 --> 1684.84]  with the good of our city
[1684.84 --> 1686.80]  and resist with strength
[1686.80 --> 1687.72]  and courage
[1687.72 --> 1690.36]  all the dehumanizing idols.
[1691.50 --> 1693.34]  And that can only be done
[1693.34 --> 1695.20]  as Jesus' spirit
[1695.20 --> 1696.56]  fills us with power.
[1698.24 --> 1699.32]  I actually want to finish
[1699.32 --> 1699.82]  this morning
[1699.82 --> 1700.54]  with an invitation
[1700.54 --> 1701.64]  to a practice.
[1702.60 --> 1703.64]  It's the practice
[1703.64 --> 1704.52]  of prayer walking.
[1705.44 --> 1706.04]  Maybe you're like,
[1706.10 --> 1706.96]  wow, why would Dave finish
[1706.96 --> 1708.40]  with this invitation?
[1708.52 --> 1709.46]  And the reason is this.
[1710.44 --> 1711.54]  So much of the good
[1711.54 --> 1712.82]  that's happened in our church
[1712.82 --> 1714.76]  is because I believe
[1714.76 --> 1716.24]  we have been a church
[1716.24 --> 1716.80]  that prayed.
[1717.72 --> 1718.06]  In fact,
[1718.10 --> 1719.10]  the building of this building
[1719.10 --> 1720.40]  seven plus years ago,
[1720.70 --> 1721.48]  people would prayer walk
[1721.48 --> 1722.04]  on this property
[1722.04 --> 1723.02]  every single day.
[1723.10 --> 1723.66]  Did you know that?
[1723.84 --> 1724.42]  I don't know if you're new here.
[1724.50 --> 1725.06]  People prayer walked
[1725.06 --> 1725.48]  on this property
[1725.48 --> 1726.10]  every single day,
[1726.18 --> 1726.86]  praying for the city,
[1727.16 --> 1728.22]  praying for the future of Clayton,
[1728.50 --> 1729.46]  praying for the church
[1729.46 --> 1730.08]  that would one day
[1730.08 --> 1731.04]  be who you are
[1731.04 --> 1732.00]  in this building
[1732.00 --> 1733.20]  worshiping Jesus Christ.
[1733.96 --> 1734.98]  And on the walls
[1734.98 --> 1736.50]  behind this drywall
[1736.50 --> 1737.82]  are written prayers.
[1737.82 --> 1738.50]  Did you know that?
[1739.28 --> 1740.24]  Prayers for God
[1740.24 --> 1741.22]  to do His work in us,
[1741.34 --> 1741.96]  prayers for people
[1741.96 --> 1742.66]  to know who He is,
[1742.74 --> 1743.62]  prayers for conversion.
[1743.96 --> 1745.02]  And I really do believe
[1745.02 --> 1746.00]  that in that season
[1746.00 --> 1746.78]  of prayer walking,
[1747.32 --> 1748.22]  writing these prayers down,
[1748.34 --> 1750.84]  God honored and blessed us.
[1751.80 --> 1752.48]  And some of you
[1752.48 --> 1753.32]  were here for that.
[1753.96 --> 1754.96]  And you get to celebrate
[1754.96 --> 1756.36]  God answering your prayers
[1756.36 --> 1757.46]  written on these walls.
[1758.22 --> 1759.18]  But I really do think
[1759.18 --> 1760.48]  there is this basic posture
[1760.48 --> 1761.12]  of people in our church
[1761.12 --> 1761.34]  who said,
[1761.40 --> 1761.98]  I'm just going to walk
[1761.98 --> 1762.64]  around this city.
[1763.02 --> 1763.88]  And it's not complicated,
[1764.00 --> 1764.38]  by the way.
[1764.54 --> 1765.32]  You just walk around.
[1765.40 --> 1766.04]  You see the buildings.
[1766.04 --> 1766.78]  You see the businesses.
[1767.06 --> 1767.78]  You see the schools.
[1767.90 --> 1768.68]  You see the institutions.
[1768.88 --> 1769.92]  And you pray for them.
[1770.80 --> 1771.56]  And lo and behold,
[1771.66 --> 1772.34]  you know what happens?
[1772.68 --> 1773.28]  I can say this
[1773.28 --> 1774.12]  from personal experience.
[1774.54 --> 1775.18]  God gives you
[1775.18 --> 1776.50]  His concern for this city.
[1777.76 --> 1778.62]  It's very hard
[1778.62 --> 1779.30]  to hate a place
[1779.30 --> 1780.28]  that God's placed you in
[1780.28 --> 1781.54]  and that you're praying for.
[1782.30 --> 1782.96]  It's very hard
[1782.96 --> 1783.72]  to hate institutions
[1783.72 --> 1784.70]  that God has given you
[1784.70 --> 1785.72]  a desire to pray for.
[1785.88 --> 1786.68]  And as we pray
[1786.68 --> 1787.36]  around this city,
[1787.46 --> 1788.24]  around your neighborhood,
[1788.52 --> 1790.12]  I know that as you do it,
[1790.62 --> 1791.46]  God and His power,
[1791.58 --> 1791.94]  His love,
[1791.98 --> 1792.36]  and His grace
[1792.36 --> 1793.68]  will give you His heart.
[1794.54 --> 1795.68]  And that's precisely
[1795.68 --> 1797.12]  what hope we need
[1797.12 --> 1798.28]  for the future
[1798.28 --> 1799.22]  of being the church.
[1800.04 --> 1800.56]  It's precisely
[1800.56 --> 1801.76]  what our children need
[1801.76 --> 1802.76]  as they grow up
[1802.76 --> 1803.38]  in this church.
[1803.98 --> 1804.92]  They need believers
[1804.92 --> 1806.52]  who have Jesus' heart
[1806.52 --> 1807.64]  for the city
[1807.64 --> 1809.96]  that stands in solidarity
[1809.96 --> 1811.18]  with that which is good,
[1811.26 --> 1812.44]  known for its celebration
[1812.44 --> 1813.36]  of God's goodness,
[1814.00 --> 1815.50]  and resists the idols
[1815.50 --> 1816.46]  that dehumanize.
[1817.42 --> 1818.16]  It's an outpost
[1818.16 --> 1818.82]  of flourishing
[1818.82 --> 1820.36]  that invites the city
[1820.36 --> 1821.74]  to know the power
[1821.74 --> 1822.32]  of the gospel.
[1823.54 --> 1824.36]  Would you join me
[1824.36 --> 1824.70]  in prayer?
[1831.90 --> 1832.84]  Father, we thank You
[1832.84 --> 1834.06]  so much for Your Scripture,
[1834.62 --> 1836.46]  and we thank You
[1836.46 --> 1837.58]  for the challenge of Jonah.
[1839.40 --> 1840.26]  We pray, Lord,
[1840.32 --> 1841.16]  that You would break
[1841.16 --> 1843.32]  our hearts for our city,
[1843.82 --> 1845.38]  that You would give us
[1845.38 --> 1846.30]  Your concern,
[1847.00 --> 1847.76]  Your love,
[1847.96 --> 1848.66]  Your compassion,
[1848.84 --> 1849.64]  Your grace,
[1850.36 --> 1850.96]  for the places
[1850.96 --> 1851.68]  where we dwell,
[1852.64 --> 1853.38]  where we work,
[1853.96 --> 1855.24]  where our kids go to school,
[1855.82 --> 1856.98]  where we spend our leisure.
[1858.20 --> 1859.10]  Lord, would You give us
[1859.10 --> 1860.10]  eyes to see
[1860.10 --> 1861.58]  the good,
[1862.38 --> 1863.16]  the beautiful,
[1863.80 --> 1865.12]  that which You celebrate.
[1866.16 --> 1867.46]  Give us eyes to see
[1867.46 --> 1868.62]  the idols,
[1869.14 --> 1869.98]  and the courage,
[1870.68 --> 1871.38]  the strength,
[1871.92 --> 1872.52]  the perseverance
[1872.52 --> 1873.52]  to resist them,
[1873.92 --> 1875.60]  and show the way of Christ,
[1875.86 --> 1876.78]  the way of flourishing.
[1876.78 --> 1879.08]  Holy Spirit,
[1879.14 --> 1880.28]  would You fill us,
[1881.02 --> 1881.86]  and to give us
[1881.86 --> 1882.46]  the strength,
[1882.68 --> 1883.56]  the power,
[1884.00 --> 1884.96]  and the love we need
[1884.96 --> 1885.66]  to be faithful
[1885.66 --> 1886.54]  in this city.
[1887.54 --> 1889.62]  We pray this in Christ's name.
[1889.92 --> 1890.20]  Amen.
[1892.42 --> 1893.54]  I invite you to stand
[1893.54 --> 1894.22]  and sing with me
[1894.22 --> 1895.24]  our song of response,
[1895.32 --> 1896.58]  a song about the city.
[1897.60 --> 1898.96]  You are the God of the city.
[1899.02 --> 1899.90]  Let's stand as we worship.
[1900.12 --> 1900.76]  Thank you,
[1900.90 --> 1901.40]  and that's it.
[1901.46 --> 1901.86]  Thank you,
