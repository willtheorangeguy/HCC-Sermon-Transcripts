[2159.08 → 2189.08] Thank you.
[2189.08 → 2219.08] Thank you.
[2219.08 → 2249.08] Thank you.
[2249.08 → 2279.06] And you,
[2279.08 → 2309.06] He has prayed,
[2309.08 → 2311.00] brought down rulers from their thrones,
[2311.34 → 2312.92] but lifted the humble.
[2313.70 → 2315.58] He has filled the hungry with good things,
[2315.68 → 2317.66] but has sent the rich away empty.
[2318.62 → 2320.24] He has helped his servant Israel,
[2320.40 → 2322.20] remembering to be merciful to Abraham
[2322.20 → 2324.18] and his descendants forever,
[2324.76 → 2326.98] just as he promised our ancestors.
[2328.68 → 2331.12] Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months
[2331.12 → 2332.94] and then returned home.
[2339.08 → 2341.76] A little while ago, I was talking to a man named Jim.
[2342.88 → 2346.04] And Jim was telling me his story of coming to faith,
[2346.26 → 2347.36] but in this particular moment,
[2347.42 → 2348.92] he was telling me the first experience
[2348.92 → 2350.54] he ever had going to church.
[2351.36 → 2352.42] Jim didn't grow up a Christian,
[2352.62 → 2353.80] not part of a Christian family,
[2354.08 → 2356.52] and the university, a friend of his who was a Christian,
[2356.68 → 2357.72] invited him to church.
[2358.64 → 2360.18] And Jim said, sure, I'll go.
[2360.72 → 2362.08] And so his friend broke down for him,
[2362.08 → 2363.78] you know, this church thing,
[2363.88 → 2365.86] what to expect with a sermon, how to dress.
[2366.48 → 2368.04] And so Jim goes to his first service
[2368.04 → 2370.60] and, you know, very typical of a first-time guest.
[2370.70 → 2373.00] He sits right in the back row, blends in,
[2373.06 → 2373.94] doesn't want to get too involved,
[2374.04 → 2374.96] doesn't want to sit in the front
[2374.96 → 2378.38] where all the, you know, the real engaged people go.
[2379.30 → 2381.64] And much to Jim's surprise, he sits down
[2381.64 → 2383.72] and with no real warning,
[2384.00 → 2386.84] everybody else stands up, and they just start singing.
[2387.66 → 2389.54] And Jim is absolutely floored.
[2389.62 → 2391.24] He had no one prepare him for this
[2391.24 → 2393.16] and he thought it was the weirdest thing in the world
[2393.16 → 2394.76] that Christians every Sunday
[2394.76 → 2397.56] gathered to do what he called a group karaoke.
[2398.04 → 2400.28] Where they just sing songs together.
[2401.00 → 2402.98] That was a weird experience.
[2403.20 → 2405.06] And I bet if you did not grow up in the church
[2405.06 → 2406.86] and maybe you came to church for the first time,
[2406.90 → 2409.76] you thought the same thing, like, what is going on?
[2410.28 → 2412.84] Sunday after Sunday, they sing together.
[2414.28 → 2416.50] Now there is something very interesting
[2416.50 → 2420.84] and beautiful and even mysterious about singing.
[2421.78 → 2423.62] It's hard to even explain how it works,
[2423.72 → 2425.34] but there are things that happen to us,
[2425.34 → 2426.84] there are experiences we go through
[2426.84 → 2429.48] where we move from just using words and speaking
[2429.48 → 2432.30] to needing almost to sing.
[2433.12 → 2435.10] Perhaps you can think of times in your own life
[2435.10 → 2437.62] where you can remember this need to sing.
[2438.32 → 2441.12] Perhaps you got, you know, accepted into the university
[2441.12 → 2442.68] you never thought you'd make it into
[2442.68 → 2443.40] and all of a sudden,
[2443.74 → 2445.78] you as this really cool 17-year-old
[2445.78 → 2447.28] is dancing around the house,
[2447.60 → 2449.26] singing your little celebration song.
[2449.26 → 2453.62] Or finally, after years of thinking you'll propose,
[2453.82 → 2454.88] she says yes to you
[2454.88 → 2456.66] and you're just brimming with joy.
[2457.32 → 2460.26] Or the person you love, a family member,
[2460.36 → 2462.32] they celebrate this milestone birthday
[2462.32 → 2464.48] and you bring all the family and friends together
[2464.48 → 2468.08] and you know you just have to sing happy birthday,
[2468.24 → 2469.76] even though they hate that.
[2470.90 → 2472.38] We're created to sing.
[2473.00 → 2475.50] There's something about joy and experiences we go through
[2475.50 → 2478.54] that require us to do more than words but sing.
[2479.42 → 2482.06] In fact, in a new members class we had this Wednesday,
[2482.20 → 2483.42] someone astutely pointed out
[2483.42 → 2486.24] that Christians are one of the few religions
[2486.24 → 2488.50] where we sing what we believe.
[2489.30 → 2491.68] And the reason is, at least in part for me,
[2491.76 → 2493.52] is we've come to believe
[2493.52 → 2496.08] that something so significant has happened
[2496.08 → 2497.08] in the coming of Jesus,
[2497.22 → 2499.18] so powerful has taken place
[2499.18 → 2500.08] through his death and resurrection,
[2500.50 → 2502.88] that generations of believers
[2502.88 → 2507.28] write new songs to praise and to worship.
[2508.26 → 2510.30] And it never ceases to amaze me
[2510.30 → 2512.12] how, you know, as even I get older,
[2512.22 → 2514.00] I see new worship songs being written
[2514.00 → 2516.18] that celebrate the beauty and the majesty of God
[2516.18 → 2520.00] because it's inexhaustible and we must sing.
[2521.50 → 2523.82] A story that I find quite moving
[2523.82 → 2526.38] is of a young couple, not a believing couple,
[2527.04 → 2528.82] and one of the challenges they faced
[2528.82 → 2530.20] in their marriage early on
[2530.20 → 2531.86] was fertility and getting pregnant.
[2531.86 → 2533.80] They had lots of complications getting pregnant
[2533.80 → 2536.02] and keeping the baby once they did conceive.
[2536.50 → 2537.84] And after many years of hardship,
[2538.04 → 2539.36] this couple did have a baby
[2539.36 → 2540.52] and it came to full term.
[2540.90 → 2543.48] And the husband held his healthy whole child
[2543.48 → 2544.40] for the first time.
[2544.80 → 2546.94] And this guy describes the experience
[2546.94 → 2549.34] as hard to even contain his joy.
[2549.72 → 2552.46] He was just brimming full of gratitude
[2552.46 → 2555.14] and wanting to praise, wanting to give thanks.
[2555.22 → 2556.44] But the challenge for him was,
[2556.82 → 2558.94] he felt this need to thank someone
[2558.94 → 2561.28] but didn't know who to thank.
[2562.04 → 2564.94] And that led him down this long journey of faith
[2564.94 → 2566.58] to where he finally met Jesus,
[2566.80 → 2567.62] became a Christian,
[2567.62 → 2570.64] and gave the praise to the God
[2570.64 → 2572.84] who gave them the gift of life.
[2573.84 → 2576.56] We're created to sing.
[2577.08 → 2578.90] We're created to praise.
[2578.90 → 2581.42] And I don't think it should surprise us then
[2581.42 → 2584.56] that when Luke records the stories
[2584.56 → 2588.08] of people hearing God's plan of sending Jesus,
[2588.90 → 2590.62] that when they hear what he's going to do,
[2590.74 → 2592.56] when they receive word from angels
[2592.56 → 2593.82] of what his plan is,
[2593.94 → 2595.20] they just have this gut,
[2595.64 → 2597.92] visceral response of praise.
[2598.64 → 2600.78] They can't help but sing
[2600.78 → 2602.98] of response of joy.
[2602.98 → 2606.18] And the first song in the Gospel of Luke
[2606.18 → 2608.02] that we're going to look at is Mary.
[2608.84 → 2610.40] Now Mary's been on quite the journey.
[2610.52 → 2611.76] If you read starting, you know,
[2611.84 → 2613.50] Gabriel visiting her,
[2613.90 → 2615.32] surprising her with the news
[2615.32 → 2617.84] that the Holy Spirit is going to overshadow her.
[2618.84 → 2621.22] Miraculously, somehow God is going to enable her
[2621.22 → 2621.76] to conceive,
[2622.14 → 2623.56] and the child she's going to bear
[2623.56 → 2624.80] has to be named Jesus.
[2625.56 → 2627.74] And Gabriel says it's going to be the Son of God.
[2627.96 → 2629.88] It's going to sit on David's throne forever
[2629.88 → 2631.86] and establish the kingdom of God.
[2631.86 → 2635.28] I have a feeling Mary had this dizzying experience
[2635.28 → 2636.28] of taking all this in,
[2636.36 → 2639.04] but she does what I think any woman would do
[2639.04 → 2639.72] in this circumstance.
[2639.84 → 2640.46] You know what that is?
[2641.08 → 2643.04] She runs to her friend's house
[2643.04 → 2645.26] and tells Elizabeth the news.
[2646.00 → 2647.74] And then you have this scene which we read
[2647.74 → 2649.82] where Elizabeth and Mary are together
[2649.82 → 2652.68] and this is so full of the Spirit, right?
[2652.76 → 2655.42] Mary comes, the child leaps in Elizabeth's womb.
[2655.90 → 2658.02] Elizabeth basically prophesies over Mary
[2658.02 → 2659.44] saying, blessed are you,
[2659.90 → 2661.22] blessed is this child,
[2661.22 → 2664.18] where this unexpectedly old woman who's pregnant
[2664.18 → 2666.60] and unexpectedly young woman who is pregnant
[2666.60 → 2667.86] come together in joy.
[2668.68 → 2670.70] And then Mary starts to sing.
[2672.14 → 2673.48] And we have before us
[2673.48 → 2675.64] what is famously known as the Magnificat.
[2676.34 → 2678.84] And it's described, at least by one writer,
[2679.56 → 2681.98] as the most popular Christian song.
[2683.24 → 2684.80] It's, and this is from N.T. Wright,
[2684.88 → 2685.22] he says,
[2685.28 → 2687.32] this is the most famous song in Christianity.
[2687.32 → 2689.30] It's been whispered in monasteries,
[2689.46 → 2690.54] chanted in cathedrals,
[2690.96 → 2692.70] recited in small remote churches
[2692.70 → 2693.96] by evening candlelight,
[2694.20 → 2696.50] and set to music with trumpets and kettle drums
[2696.50 → 2698.14] by Johann Sebastian Bach.
[2699.60 → 2701.02] And this morning I want us,
[2701.08 → 2702.28] as we engage this passage,
[2702.38 → 2703.40] and I'm going to read it in just a minute,
[2703.96 → 2705.44] I want us to listen well.
[2705.44 → 2708.26] I think if you grow up in the church especially,
[2708.46 → 2709.60] and maybe even if you don't,
[2709.66 → 2711.50] we've got lots of preconceived notions
[2711.50 → 2712.76] about what Advent is about,
[2713.16 → 2714.72] what the birth of Jesus is about,
[2714.92 → 2716.62] we have lots of assumptions about it,
[2716.66 → 2718.22] and I want us to listen in
[2718.22 → 2720.72] on what this news meant
[2720.72 → 2722.40] for the original hearers.
[2723.06 → 2725.46] What Mary was singing about,
[2725.56 → 2727.30] what Zachariah was singing about,
[2727.46 → 2729.28] what they believe to be true
[2729.28 → 2730.34] about this child,
[2731.40 → 2732.28] and what it teaches us
[2732.28 → 2733.62] about God's salvation plan.
[2733.62 → 2738.38] So let's listen to how Mary starts this song.
[2739.24 → 2740.32] Actually, before I read this,
[2740.38 → 2741.16] let me just say this.
[2741.74 → 2743.08] This song is first and foremost
[2743.08 → 2744.18] a song of celebration.
[2745.00 → 2746.68] And for me, that's actually quite impressive
[2746.68 → 2747.88] and even surprising,
[2748.32 → 2749.76] because a very human Mary
[2749.76 → 2752.00] would be afraid, right?
[2752.08 → 2753.46] Imagine you were a young woman,
[2753.56 → 2755.38] you're not married yet in a Jewish culture,
[2755.58 → 2756.72] and all of a sudden you're pregnant.
[2757.44 → 2759.04] And the first thing I would think of is,
[2759.28 → 2760.58] here comes the gossip.
[2761.38 → 2763.26] Here comes the rumours among the people
[2763.26 → 2764.98] in the village about the relationship
[2764.98 → 2766.22] between Joseph and Mary,
[2766.28 → 2767.14] and what that means,
[2767.20 → 2768.40] and the shame on the family,
[2768.46 → 2769.40] and her as an individual.
[2769.76 → 2772.16] But Mary is completely unconcerned
[2772.16 → 2773.58] about those human issues.
[2774.36 → 2775.82] What she's aware of
[2775.82 → 2777.52] is that God Most High
[2777.52 → 2778.90] has visited her,
[2779.12 → 2780.44] and He is enabling her
[2780.44 → 2783.34] to be the mother of Jesus Christ,
[2783.64 → 2784.54] the Son of God.
[2784.78 → 2786.00] And this is how she starts.
[2786.00 → 2789.58] My soul glorifies the Lord.
[2790.32 → 2792.94] My spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,
[2793.34 → 2794.72] for He has been mindful
[2794.72 → 2796.78] of the humble state of His servant.
[2797.76 → 2798.76] From now on,
[2799.08 → 2801.88] all generations will call me blessed,
[2802.16 → 2803.26] for the Mighty One
[2803.26 → 2804.84] has done great things for me.
[2805.50 → 2806.80] Holy is His name.
[2808.70 → 2809.82] One of the reasons
[2809.82 → 2811.02] that Mary celebrates,
[2811.12 → 2812.08] especially in these verses,
[2812.08 → 2814.76] is that God Most High
[2814.76 → 2816.14] has noticed her.
[2816.88 → 2817.62] It actually echoes
[2817.62 → 2818.74] what we've been preaching on
[2818.74 → 2820.18] with Ruth and Naomi,
[2820.60 → 2821.96] where you've got this God
[2821.96 → 2823.02] who's orchestrating
[2823.02 → 2824.06] all things for His good,
[2824.14 → 2824.98] and He chooses
[2824.98 → 2827.56] this obscure, poor woman
[2827.56 → 2829.14] in the first century
[2829.14 → 2830.38] to accomplish His purposes.
[2831.18 → 2832.94] And Mary has this sense of like,
[2833.50 → 2835.76] wow, me?
[2836.82 → 2838.74] I'm the one who's going to be part
[2838.74 → 2839.64] of your plan of redemption?
[2839.64 → 2841.68] I'm the one who you're going to use
[2841.68 → 2844.16] to bring the Saviour into creation?
[2845.16 → 2846.26] I'm the vessel
[2846.26 → 2847.60] that you're going to use
[2847.60 → 2849.30] to move your plan forward?
[2849.80 → 2850.18] Whoa.
[2851.86 → 2853.28] You know, there's a good chance
[2853.28 → 2855.70] that if you were to walk around Galilee
[2855.70 → 2856.62] in the first century
[2856.62 → 2857.88] and get to know the community,
[2858.10 → 2860.08] you wouldn't even notice Mary.
[2861.10 → 2862.42] She's not a woman of status.
[2863.10 → 2864.62] She doesn't have any claim to a title.
[2865.02 → 2866.72] She's young, and she's poor.
[2866.72 → 2869.22] Here, in almost all metrics,
[2869.40 → 2870.36] Mary is insignificant.
[2870.98 → 2872.08] And here she's marvelling
[2872.08 → 2873.70] at God Most High,
[2874.06 → 2875.32] saying, you're the one, Mary.
[2876.12 → 2877.56] You're the one that I choose
[2877.56 → 2880.20] to accomplish my plan of salvation.
[2881.66 → 2882.58] It's hard to imagine, hey,
[2882.60 → 2883.48] what it'd be like for Mary
[2883.48 → 2884.18] in that circumstance.
[2884.72 → 2885.82] And I don't think any of us
[2885.82 → 2887.22] can quite get to that place
[2887.22 → 2888.90] of what her experience was like,
[2888.94 → 2890.00] but I do think this.
[2890.50 → 2892.36] I do think many Christians
[2892.36 → 2894.82] have this moment of realizing
[2894.82 → 2897.42] this big, sovereign God
[2897.42 → 2899.34] notices our small,
[2899.52 → 2901.12] seemingly insignificant lives.
[2902.24 → 2903.14] Perhaps, for you,
[2903.20 → 2904.46] it's the story of coming to faith,
[2904.92 → 2906.46] where you realize there is a God
[2906.46 → 2907.44] who's come in Jesus,
[2907.86 → 2908.76] who sent His Spirit,
[2908.84 → 2910.36] and that God is encountering us
[2910.36 → 2911.94] and pulling us into His life
[2911.94 → 2912.56] and His love.
[2913.38 → 2914.42] Perhaps you can remember that
[2914.42 → 2915.14] in your own life.
[2915.46 → 2917.02] Or perhaps it's reading the Scriptures,
[2917.02 → 2918.40] and you just sense
[2918.40 → 2919.66] God is speaking to you,
[2919.74 → 2921.38] He's revealing His grace to you,
[2921.54 → 2922.84] He's cleansing you
[2922.84 → 2923.84] with the work that has been
[2923.84 → 2924.80] finished on the cross,
[2924.90 → 2926.04] and you just marvel,
[2926.12 → 2927.02] like, wow, God,
[2927.28 → 2928.30] you see me.
[2929.30 → 2931.22] Or perhaps it's just you see.
[2931.36 → 2931.98] Sometimes,
[2932.06 → 2933.20] God gives us glimpses
[2933.20 → 2934.92] of a sovereign work in our lives,
[2934.96 → 2935.60] and you see people
[2935.60 → 2936.36] coming into your life,
[2936.58 → 2937.88] you see pieces coming together
[2937.88 → 2938.50] in relationships,
[2938.68 → 2939.34] where all of a sudden you're like,
[2939.48 → 2941.80] whoa, God's done all this
[2941.80 → 2943.24] to care for me,
[2944.00 → 2944.88] to bless me,
[2944.88 → 2947.30] to show His goodness to me.
[2948.06 → 2950.34] My little insignificant life
[2950.34 → 2951.90] living at this moment in history,
[2952.14 → 2953.50] and the Creator of the universe
[2953.50 → 2955.80] notices, He sees.
[2956.22 → 2957.22] And when we have those moments,
[2957.28 → 2957.96] you know what it's like.
[2958.00 → 2959.52] You just turn your heart to Him,
[2959.84 → 2960.26] and you say,
[2960.38 → 2961.38] holy is your name.
[2961.96 → 2963.80] My soul magnifies the Lord,
[2964.18 → 2965.52] because the sovereign God
[2965.52 → 2967.18] sees us in all of our
[2967.18 → 2968.72] ordinary insignificance
[2968.72 → 2969.60] in the grand scheme.
[2972.50 → 2973.44] I want to highlight
[2973.44 → 2974.24] that this is not just
[2974.24 → 2975.34] a song of celebration,
[2975.82 → 2976.68] but it's actually
[2976.68 → 2977.78] a song of revolution.
[2978.92 → 2979.86] You might be surprised
[2979.86 → 2980.30] to hear this,
[2980.38 → 2981.28] but I'm quite convinced
[2981.28 → 2981.88] that Mary,
[2982.00 → 2983.28] if she were to sing this song
[2983.28 → 2984.46] in certain spaces,
[2985.14 → 2986.54] with certain people around,
[2986.76 → 2988.44] it's actually a treasonous,
[2988.94 → 2990.02] dangerous song.
[2991.18 → 2992.18] Bishop Robert Barron
[2992.18 → 2992.84] has once said,
[2992.88 → 2994.14] and I think he's absolutely right,
[2994.40 → 2995.70] that we can't understand
[2995.70 → 2997.08] Advent correctly
[2997.08 → 2998.44] until we see it as
[2998.44 → 3000.94] a preparation for revolution,
[3000.94 → 3002.38] an anticipation
[3002.38 → 3004.76] of some big upheaval coming,
[3004.76 → 3007.04] where God acts powerfully.
[3008.04 → 3009.20] And I want to read for us
[3009.20 → 3009.94] this next song,
[3010.04 → 3010.88] next part of the song
[3010.88 → 3011.62] in verse 51.
[3012.00 → 3013.40] Listen to these bold words
[3013.40 → 3014.32] in Mary's song.
[3015.32 → 3016.40] He, that is God,
[3016.52 → 3018.10] has performed mighty deeds
[3018.10 → 3018.86] with His arm.
[3019.18 → 3020.46] He has scattered those
[3020.46 → 3021.16] who are proud
[3021.16 → 3022.32] in their inmost thoughts.
[3022.56 → 3023.94] He has brought down rulers
[3023.94 → 3025.20] from their thrones,
[3025.42 → 3026.70] but has lifted the humble.
[3027.26 → 3028.36] He has filled the hungry
[3028.36 → 3029.16] with good things,
[3029.26 → 3032.06] but sent the rich away hungry.
[3033.54 → 3034.86] This song right here
[3034.86 → 3036.10] is nothing short
[3036.10 → 3037.36] of Mary celebrating
[3037.36 → 3039.04] that the God she worships
[3039.04 → 3040.00] can overthrow
[3040.00 → 3041.00] the power structures
[3041.00 → 3041.56] of the world.
[3042.24 → 3043.38] That God can actually
[3043.38 → 3044.50] tear down rulers
[3044.50 → 3045.26] who are corrupt
[3045.26 → 3046.32] and violent and greedy
[3046.32 → 3047.42] from their thrones
[3047.42 → 3048.72] and lift the humble.
[3049.88 → 3051.16] And don't imagine
[3051.16 → 3052.54] Mary singing this song
[3052.54 → 3053.48] in some safe,
[3053.66 → 3054.60] comfortable space
[3054.60 → 3055.20] in her city.
[3056.34 → 3056.64] Mary,
[3056.88 → 3057.64] just like the rest
[3057.64 → 3058.26] of her people,
[3058.36 → 3060.14] are living under oppression.
[3060.78 → 3060.90] You know,
[3060.92 → 3061.44] all the songs
[3061.44 → 3062.42] that we often sing today
[3062.42 → 3063.38] about Christmas,
[3063.58 → 3065.44] they present a serene Christmas.
[3065.78 → 3065.96] You know,
[3066.24 → 3067.50] Jesus makes no crying.
[3067.96 → 3068.78] The nativity scene
[3068.78 → 3069.36] is beautiful
[3069.36 → 3070.78] when really it's not
[3070.78 → 3071.40] a safe place.
[3071.46 → 3072.72] It's not a safe environment.
[3072.94 → 3073.60] There are revolutions
[3073.60 → 3075.30] happening all over the cities
[3075.30 → 3076.56] and the Roman Empire
[3076.56 → 3078.00] is killing Jewish people.
[3079.06 → 3079.86] Mary is singing
[3079.86 → 3081.16] in an oppressive era
[3081.16 → 3082.88] and she has the boldness
[3082.88 → 3083.40] to say,
[3083.80 → 3085.00] the God that I worship
[3085.00 → 3087.06] can tear down rulers
[3087.06 → 3087.94] from their thrones.
[3088.64 → 3089.60] The God that I worship
[3089.60 → 3090.90] will oppose the proud
[3090.90 → 3092.50] and he will exalt the humble.
[3092.92 → 3093.16] I mean,
[3093.20 → 3094.70] these are treasonous words.
[3095.86 → 3097.10] And just a reminder again,
[3097.24 → 3098.10] if you think through
[3098.10 → 3098.96] where Mary's life
[3098.96 → 3099.58] is going to go,
[3100.02 → 3101.62] it is not going to be easy.
[3102.16 → 3103.04] Jesus is born
[3103.04 → 3104.22] with a price on his head.
[3104.32 → 3105.06] Herod the Great.
[3105.54 → 3106.28] And sometimes
[3106.28 → 3106.90] you hear a title
[3106.90 → 3107.64] called Herod the Great
[3107.64 → 3108.70] and you should be worried
[3108.70 → 3109.20] about anyone
[3109.20 → 3110.02] who gives themselves
[3110.02 → 3110.58] the title
[3110.58 → 3111.42] The Great.
[3111.80 → 3112.04] Right?
[3112.40 → 3113.56] It's never a good sign.
[3113.72 → 3113.78] Like,
[3113.84 → 3115.34] that's like secret code word
[3115.34 → 3115.98] for tyrant.
[3116.52 → 3117.24] And Herod hears
[3117.24 → 3118.18] that there's this child
[3118.18 → 3119.12] being born in Israel.
[3119.48 → 3120.24] There's a prophecy
[3120.24 → 3121.64] about him being the Messiah.
[3121.88 → 3122.60] And what does he do?
[3123.80 → 3125.02] He enacts a genocide
[3125.02 → 3126.22] against all children
[3126.22 → 3127.08] under the age of two.
[3127.30 → 3128.36] And what do Mary and Joseph
[3128.36 → 3128.92] have to do?
[3129.10 → 3130.00] They have to flee
[3130.00 → 3131.64] as refugees to Egypt,
[3132.04 → 3134.24] 690 kilometres away,
[3134.64 → 3136.16] so that Jesus stays alive.
[3137.12 → 3138.82] This is a treasonous song
[3138.82 → 3140.34] sung about a God
[3140.34 → 3141.20] who has the power
[3141.20 → 3142.58] to oppose
[3142.58 → 3143.74] the corrupt leaders
[3143.74 → 3144.58] of the day.
[3146.58 → 3147.02] Now,
[3147.16 → 3147.90] the scholars
[3147.90 → 3149.00] who write on this song
[3149.00 → 3149.92] and they dissect it
[3149.92 → 3150.48] quite a bit
[3150.48 → 3152.26] point out
[3152.26 → 3153.28] that when Mary sings
[3153.28 → 3153.68] this song
[3153.68 → 3155.00] she speaks in past tense.
[3155.04 → 3155.82] And maybe you notice that
[3155.82 → 3156.96] when Mary sings her song
[3156.96 → 3158.18] she sings about
[3158.18 → 3158.80] how God
[3158.80 → 3160.50] has brought down
[3160.50 → 3161.92] rulers from their throne.
[3162.16 → 3162.58] And I think
[3162.58 → 3163.36] it's really significant
[3163.36 → 3164.58] that Mary is singing
[3164.58 → 3166.10] as an Israelite woman.
[3166.22 → 3167.12] She knows her story.
[3167.60 → 3168.62] And it's very likely
[3168.62 → 3169.62] that when she's singing this
[3169.62 → 3170.16] she's thinking
[3170.16 → 3171.88] in our story
[3171.88 → 3172.98] when Moses
[3172.98 → 3174.38] brought his people
[3174.38 → 3175.02] God's people
[3175.02 → 3175.62] out of Egypt
[3175.62 → 3176.74] God showed
[3176.74 → 3177.74] his mighty arm
[3177.74 → 3178.34] that's what Exodus
[3178.34 → 3178.88] talks about
[3178.88 → 3179.94] the mighty arm of God
[3179.94 → 3181.84] overthrowing the Pharaoh
[3181.84 → 3183.24] and swallowing up
[3183.24 → 3184.00] Pharaoh's army.
[3184.94 → 3186.70] And as Mary sings this
[3186.70 → 3188.14] it is also the hope
[3188.14 → 3188.74] of her people
[3188.74 → 3189.64] and Mary herself
[3189.64 → 3191.20] that God will do it again.
[3192.56 → 3193.80] That her God
[3193.80 → 3195.12] has the power
[3195.12 → 3196.40] to overthrow
[3196.40 → 3197.80] the great empire
[3197.80 → 3198.18] of the day
[3198.18 → 3198.86] that is Rome.
[3199.30 → 3199.98] His army
[3199.98 → 3200.80] his rulers
[3200.80 → 3201.68] and his authority.
[3201.80 → 3202.32] And it's worth
[3202.32 → 3203.12] pausing and asking
[3203.12 → 3203.60] the question
[3203.60 → 3204.78] when we sing
[3204.78 → 3207.16] when we praise God
[3207.16 → 3208.96] is that the big
[3208.96 → 3210.04] vision of God
[3210.04 → 3211.00] and what he can accomplish
[3211.00 → 3212.02] that we have
[3212.02 → 3212.70] in our hearts?
[3213.50 → 3214.38] I mean Mary has
[3214.38 → 3216.28] a sense of a sovereign God
[3216.28 → 3217.78] with sovereign power
[3217.78 → 3219.84] who has the authority
[3219.84 → 3221.38] to deal with
[3221.38 → 3222.58] all the evil
[3222.58 → 3223.56] and the corruption
[3223.56 → 3224.68] and the violence
[3224.68 → 3225.50] of the world.
[3225.50 → 3226.66] and she's praying
[3226.66 → 3227.22] and hoping
[3227.22 → 3228.40] that the Messiah
[3228.40 → 3229.62] God's giving to the world
[3229.62 → 3230.28] through her
[3230.28 → 3231.76] will accomplish that.
[3233.06 → 3234.60] I sometimes look around
[3234.60 → 3235.40] at all the ways
[3235.40 → 3236.40] that we celebrate Christmas
[3236.40 → 3238.10] and all the ways
[3238.10 → 3239.04] that we almost make it
[3239.04 → 3241.10] a quaint holiday celebration
[3241.10 → 3241.74] and I think
[3241.74 → 3243.38] would Mary recognize
[3243.38 → 3245.46] what we say
[3245.46 → 3246.76] and how we sing?
[3247.38 → 3248.36] Would Mary be able
[3248.36 → 3249.80] to identify our worship
[3249.80 → 3251.32] with what she believed
[3251.32 → 3252.34] was true of God
[3252.34 → 3253.86] who can tear down rulers
[3253.86 → 3255.24] exalt the humble
[3255.24 → 3256.28] and bring a kingdom
[3256.28 → 3256.96] of justice
[3256.96 → 3258.90] into a very broken world?
[3261.40 → 3262.42] Let me highlight
[3262.42 → 3263.54] how Mary finishes
[3263.54 → 3264.44] her song.
[3266.00 → 3267.10] Mary sings the song
[3267.10 → 3267.60] of her people
[3267.60 → 3268.24] you might say
[3268.24 → 3269.26] in verse 54
[3269.26 → 3270.18] she continues
[3270.18 → 3271.48] and concludes her song.
[3272.18 → 3273.04] He that is God
[3273.04 → 3273.76] has helped
[3273.76 → 3275.26] his servant Israel
[3275.26 → 3277.20] remembering to be merciful
[3277.20 → 3277.84] to Abraham
[3277.84 → 3279.16] and his descendants forever
[3279.16 → 3281.44] just as he promised
[3281.44 → 3282.72] our ancestors.
[3284.24 → 3284.78] One of the things
[3284.78 → 3285.34] you need to know
[3285.34 → 3286.04] about this song
[3286.04 → 3286.66] and about the heart
[3286.66 → 3287.10] of Mary
[3287.10 → 3288.72] is that she has
[3288.72 → 3290.06] the faith to believe
[3290.06 → 3291.74] that everything
[3291.74 → 3292.78] God has promised
[3292.78 → 3293.42] to Abraham
[3293.42 → 3294.24] to Isaac
[3294.24 → 3294.92] to Jacob
[3294.92 → 3295.52] to Israel
[3295.52 → 3296.92] all the covenants
[3296.92 → 3297.36] he made
[3297.36 → 3298.14] throughout the Old Testament
[3298.14 → 3299.04] he's going to make
[3299.04 → 3300.20] good on them.
[3301.26 → 3301.88] I mean Israelites
[3301.88 → 3303.10] knew how to wait
[3303.10 → 3303.64] in hope
[3303.64 → 3304.54] as the Greeks
[3304.54 → 3305.16] oppressed them
[3305.16 → 3305.74] as the Romans
[3305.74 → 3306.24] oppressed them
[3306.24 → 3306.68] as they lived
[3306.68 → 3307.46] under all these
[3307.46 → 3308.52] difficult corrupt times
[3308.52 → 3310.40] they waited
[3310.40 → 3311.86] for God
[3311.86 → 3313.02] to make good
[3313.02 → 3314.02] on those promises.
[3314.86 → 3315.42] They clung
[3315.42 → 3316.10] to the hope
[3316.10 → 3317.22] that the blessing
[3317.22 → 3317.72] of God
[3317.72 → 3318.34] would overturn
[3318.34 → 3319.08] the curse
[3319.08 → 3320.12] they saw in the world
[3320.12 → 3321.60] that the justice
[3321.60 → 3322.30] of God
[3322.30 → 3322.86] would overcome
[3322.86 → 3323.52] the corruption
[3323.52 → 3324.64] and the violence
[3324.64 → 3325.16] of the world
[3325.16 → 3325.74] they lived in
[3325.74 → 3327.12] and that the light
[3327.12 → 3327.80] of God
[3327.80 → 3328.64] which we often
[3328.64 → 3329.80] emphasize at Christmas
[3329.80 → 3331.02] would push back
[3331.02 → 3331.78] the darkness
[3331.78 → 3333.18] of the world
[3333.18 → 3334.28] and church
[3334.28 → 3335.34] let me ask us again
[3335.34 → 3337.20] do we still live
[3337.20 → 3338.48] with that kind
[3338.48 → 3339.64] of fervent hope
[3339.64 → 3340.88] that this is the God
[3340.88 → 3341.28] we worship
[3341.28 → 3342.24] who can do this?
[3346.22 → 3347.14] Here's the question
[3347.14 → 3347.80] that was running
[3347.80 → 3348.68] around my head
[3348.68 → 3349.26] this week
[3349.26 → 3349.82] in preparation
[3349.82 → 3350.66] for this sermon.
[3352.58 → 3353.36] Mary knew
[3353.36 → 3354.42] that she was going
[3354.42 → 3355.24] to give birth
[3355.24 → 3356.42] to the Son of God
[3356.42 → 3357.62] it's a pretty big thing
[3357.62 → 3358.64] to be told by an angel
[3358.64 → 3359.66] she knew
[3359.66 → 3360.14] that he was going
[3360.14 → 3360.92] to sit on the throne
[3360.92 → 3361.38] of David
[3361.38 → 3362.30] she knew
[3362.30 → 3362.78] that he was going
[3362.78 → 3363.34] to establish
[3363.34 → 3363.78] a kingdom
[3363.78 → 3364.56] that would last
[3364.56 → 3364.98] forever
[3364.98 → 3366.02] and sit on a throne
[3366.02 → 3367.04] that would last forever
[3367.04 → 3368.40] but I'm quite convinced
[3368.40 → 3368.90] that Mary
[3368.90 → 3370.04] didn't know exactly
[3370.04 → 3371.26] how that was going
[3371.26 → 3371.72] to happen
[3371.72 → 3373.66] and my hunch
[3373.66 → 3374.46] and I could be wrong
[3374.46 → 3375.52] but my hunch
[3375.52 → 3376.16] is that Mary
[3376.16 → 3377.62] just like so many Jews
[3377.62 → 3378.80] living under oppression
[3378.80 → 3380.40] was hoping
[3380.40 → 3381.62] that Jesus
[3381.62 → 3382.72] would be a warrior
[3382.72 → 3384.82] if I had more time
[3384.82 → 3385.66] I'd show a little bit
[3385.66 → 3386.40] of the backstory
[3386.40 → 3387.14] how in Israel
[3387.14 → 3387.68] at the time
[3387.68 → 3388.54] there were a number
[3388.54 → 3388.94] of people
[3388.94 → 3389.76] who would rise up
[3389.76 → 3390.60] as the warriors
[3390.60 → 3391.20] of Israel
[3391.20 → 3392.18] and they would
[3392.18 → 3393.80] sort of band together
[3393.80 → 3394.66] some resistance
[3394.66 → 3395.14] armies
[3395.14 → 3396.10] they would pick up
[3396.10 → 3396.64] their swords
[3396.64 → 3397.42] they would storm
[3397.42 → 3398.00] the palace
[3398.00 → 3398.50] they would try
[3398.50 → 3399.66] to get a revolution
[3399.66 → 3400.20] going
[3400.20 → 3400.98] and then they would
[3400.98 → 3401.92] often be killed
[3401.92 → 3403.18] the leader would be crucified
[3403.18 → 3403.90] and the movement
[3403.90 → 3404.72] would die down
[3404.72 → 3406.00] but there was that sense
[3406.00 → 3407.18] like we need a warrior
[3407.18 → 3408.66] to fight the corruption
[3408.66 → 3409.38] and the violence
[3409.38 → 3409.86] of Rome
[3409.86 → 3410.68] we need someone
[3410.68 → 3411.98] to lead the revolution
[3411.98 → 3414.74] and Jesus kept
[3414.74 → 3416.46] disappointing them
[3416.46 → 3417.86] I mean you look
[3417.86 → 3418.66] at the life of Jesus
[3418.66 → 3419.74] and you can almost see
[3419.74 → 3421.02] through this gospel accounts
[3421.02 → 3422.46] the disciples look at him
[3422.46 → 3424.14] like who is this guy
[3424.14 → 3426.46] dining with all the wrong people
[3426.46 → 3427.60] forgiving sinners
[3427.60 → 3429.28] hanging out with the tax collectors
[3429.28 → 3431.36] seeming to not really stand
[3431.36 → 3432.80] against all the terrible
[3432.80 → 3433.88] violent corruption
[3433.88 → 3435.96] and then much to everyone's surprise
[3435.96 → 3437.34] Jesus' own people
[3437.34 → 3438.32] start hating him
[3438.32 → 3439.62] rejecting him
[3439.62 → 3440.46] and then Jesus
[3440.46 → 3441.88] when he finally gets to stand
[3441.88 → 3442.60] against Rome
[3442.60 → 3443.28] and he's sitting there
[3443.28 → 3444.38] before Pontius Pilate
[3444.38 → 3445.80] he can speak his words
[3445.80 → 3446.30] of resistance
[3446.30 → 3447.62] he says nothing
[3447.62 → 3449.88] and then he gets executed
[3449.88 → 3451.76] by the Roman army
[3451.76 → 3454.56] he didn't seem to fit the mould
[3454.56 → 3456.26] and it wouldn't be
[3456.26 → 3456.84] for a number
[3456.84 → 3458.30] or for a season
[3458.30 → 3458.90] I should say
[3458.90 → 3459.64] where they would finally
[3459.64 → 3460.54] look back and say
[3460.54 → 3461.22] oh right
[3461.22 → 3462.58] Jesus was a warrior
[3462.58 → 3464.78] he did come to do battle
[3464.78 → 3465.94] but not in the way
[3465.94 → 3466.68] we expected
[3466.68 → 3468.00] not through swords
[3468.00 → 3468.74] and violence
[3468.74 → 3470.64] it was through self-sacrifice
[3470.64 → 3472.20] as Jesus hung on the cross
[3472.20 → 3473.74] it's that place
[3473.74 → 3474.60] where he absorbed
[3474.60 → 3476.00] and took on all the power
[3476.00 → 3477.02] in the principalities
[3477.02 → 3478.36] and demonic activity
[3478.36 → 3479.66] it's on the cross
[3479.66 → 3481.24] where Jesus took the full force
[3481.24 → 3482.96] of human sin and rebellion
[3482.96 → 3484.16] and it's on the cross
[3484.16 → 3485.62] where Jesus faced death
[3485.62 → 3486.84] in the face
[3486.84 → 3488.90] and brought it all down
[3488.90 → 3489.72] to the grave
[3489.72 → 3491.68] defeating it once and for all
[3491.68 → 3495.40] and surprise of all surprises
[3495.40 → 3496.76] it was Jesus
[3496.76 → 3497.90] who rose victorious
[3497.90 → 3499.60] over all those enemies
[3499.60 → 3503.64] but the surprises
[3503.64 → 3504.34] for the disciples
[3504.34 → 3505.22] and for Mary
[3505.22 → 3506.82] didn't stop there
[3506.82 → 3509.28] what confused the disciples
[3509.28 → 3510.20] and I would add Mary
[3510.20 → 3510.80] to this group
[3510.80 → 3511.70] is that they thought
[3511.70 → 3513.26] when Jesus goes to war
[3513.26 → 3515.24] everything would be made right new
[3515.24 → 3516.42] and there and then
[3516.42 → 3518.26] and yet when Jesus rises
[3518.26 → 3518.86] from the dead
[3518.86 → 3520.66] the Caesar still sits
[3520.66 → 3521.18] on the throne
[3521.18 → 3523.06] the Roman soldiers
[3523.06 → 3524.20] still have a lot of authority
[3524.20 → 3524.82] in the cities
[3524.82 → 3526.08] corruption and death
[3526.08 → 3526.58] and violence
[3526.58 → 3527.64] are still part of the world
[3527.64 → 3528.76] and the disciples are like
[3528.76 → 3530.60] alright what did happen than
[3530.60 → 3532.10] you know as they received
[3532.10 → 3532.62] the spirit
[3532.62 → 3534.08] as they followed Jesus
[3534.08 → 3535.04] as they experienced
[3535.04 → 3535.92] the life of Jesus
[3535.92 → 3536.66] in their community
[3536.66 → 3537.74] they're still wrestling
[3537.74 → 3538.78] with what is going on
[3538.78 → 3539.38] around them
[3539.38 → 3541.06] and perhaps the most surprising
[3541.06 → 3542.36] thing Jesus says to them
[3542.36 → 3545.06] is they have to keep waiting
[3545.06 → 3547.52] they have to keep living
[3547.52 → 3548.74] in Advent
[3548.74 → 3550.76] yes the new power
[3550.76 → 3551.66] of Jesus has come
[3551.66 → 3552.60] and those who believe in him
[3552.60 → 3553.26] are transformed
[3553.26 → 3554.34] and made new
[3554.34 → 3555.24] and receive grace
[3555.24 → 3555.72] and healing
[3555.72 → 3556.30] and restoration
[3556.30 → 3557.56] and yet
[3557.56 → 3558.90] we still live
[3558.90 → 3560.64] in a world full of corruption
[3560.64 → 3561.32] and violence
[3561.32 → 3561.90] and pain
[3561.90 → 3563.36] in fact just yesterday
[3563.36 → 3564.14] when we had the kids
[3564.14 → 3564.90] Christmas party
[3564.90 → 3566.92] I was talking with a young dad
[3566.92 → 3568.70] and I didn't even know him well
[3568.70 → 3569.28] but our conversation
[3569.28 → 3569.98] went pretty deep
[3569.98 → 3570.50] where he shared
[3570.50 → 3571.28] some of the frustration
[3571.28 → 3572.26] he has with the violence
[3572.26 → 3572.80] in the world
[3572.80 → 3574.84] and the pain in our own cities
[3574.84 → 3575.66] and what's going on
[3575.66 → 3576.20] with Israel
[3576.20 → 3577.16] and Palestine
[3577.16 → 3577.84] and Russia
[3577.84 → 3578.54] and Ukraine
[3578.54 → 3579.92] and there's this lament
[3579.92 → 3581.02] in his heart
[3581.02 → 3581.84] about the brokenness
[3581.84 → 3582.40] of our world
[3582.40 → 3583.98] and I had in that conversation
[3583.98 → 3584.72] the sense in
[3584.72 → 3585.36] yes
[3585.36 → 3587.06] we're still
[3587.06 → 3588.16] waiting
[3588.16 → 3590.18] and I think
[3590.18 → 3591.26] what we need to do
[3591.26 → 3593.20] is learn how to sing
[3593.20 → 3594.02] like Mary
[3594.02 → 3596.58] learn how to pray
[3596.58 → 3597.64] our faith
[3597.64 → 3598.68] that the God
[3598.68 → 3599.40] we worship
[3599.40 → 3600.32] first
[3600.32 → 3601.18] has defeated
[3601.18 → 3601.96] the powers of evil
[3601.96 → 3602.60] on the cross
[3602.60 → 3603.86] the grave is empty
[3603.86 → 3604.88] he has defeated
[3604.88 → 3605.62] all the enemies
[3605.62 → 3606.16] of sin
[3606.16 → 3606.66] death
[3606.66 → 3607.48] and Satan
[3607.48 → 3609.38] but we're still waiting
[3609.38 → 3611.22] to experience that
[3611.22 → 3611.96] in its fullness
[3611.96 → 3613.02] in our creation
[3613.02 → 3614.94] and I think
[3614.94 → 3615.74] we need to learn
[3615.74 → 3617.12] how to pray
[3617.12 → 3618.48] prayers of faith
[3618.48 → 3619.60] how to trust
[3619.60 → 3620.16] that the God
[3620.16 → 3620.64] we worship
[3620.64 → 3622.14] is coming back
[3622.14 → 3623.38] in glory and power
[3623.38 → 3623.74] in fact
[3623.74 → 3624.74] there's a passage
[3624.74 → 3625.32] that I've come back
[3625.32 → 3626.34] to a number of times
[3626.34 → 3627.46] in the last few months
[3627.46 → 3628.50] it's Revelation 19
[3628.50 → 3630.94] it's quite a staggering
[3630.94 → 3631.78] picture of Jesus
[3631.78 → 3633.24] because the picture
[3633.24 → 3633.72] of Jesus
[3633.72 → 3634.82] is no longer
[3634.82 → 3635.96] just coming in humility
[3635.96 → 3636.76] in a cradle
[3636.76 → 3637.30] like he does
[3637.30 → 3637.92] at Christmas
[3637.92 → 3639.82] it's Jesus coming back
[3639.82 → 3640.78] as the warrior
[3640.78 → 3641.46] of heaven
[3641.46 → 3643.00] to once and for all
[3643.00 → 3643.68] stand against
[3643.68 → 3644.48] all corruption
[3644.48 → 3645.70] all violence
[3645.70 → 3646.60] and all injustice
[3646.60 → 3647.96] and watch out
[3647.96 → 3649.28] to the world leaders
[3649.28 → 3651.08] who have their big plans
[3651.08 → 3652.26] their corrupt ideas
[3652.26 → 3652.94] because Jesus
[3652.94 → 3654.46] will topple them
[3654.46 → 3656.04] he will tear them down
[3656.04 → 3656.84] from their thrones
[3656.84 → 3657.86] and that will be
[3657.86 → 3659.10] how he annexed justice
[3659.10 → 3659.98] and shalom
[3659.98 → 3660.64] for his world
[3660.64 → 3662.92] and you might not
[3662.92 → 3663.86] think about this much
[3663.86 → 3665.18] because we live
[3665.18 → 3665.76] in the safety
[3665.76 → 3666.82] of Canada right now
[3666.82 → 3667.96] but our brothers
[3667.96 → 3668.48] and sisters
[3668.48 → 3669.22] in persecution
[3669.22 → 3670.26] violence and war
[3670.26 → 3671.06] around the world
[3671.06 → 3672.66] are praying fervently
[3672.66 → 3674.02] for the King Jesus
[3674.02 → 3674.94] to return in glory
[3674.94 → 3676.86] to stand against
[3676.86 → 3677.32] the corruption
[3677.32 → 3678.06] that persecutes
[3678.06 → 3678.64] kills them
[3678.64 → 3679.42] and destroys
[3679.42 → 3680.08] their cities
[3680.08 → 3681.48] and we need to learn
[3681.48 → 3682.86] how to sing with the world
[3682.86 → 3684.10] that is under oppression
[3684.10 → 3685.50] sing with our brothers
[3685.50 → 3686.10] and sisters
[3686.10 → 3687.58] who wait fervently
[3687.58 → 3688.58] for the return of Jesus
[3688.58 → 3690.22] and to believe
[3690.22 → 3691.76] that our hope
[3691.76 → 3692.56] is ultimately
[3692.56 → 3694.28] and only
[3694.28 → 3696.10] in the power
[3696.10 → 3696.64] of Jesus
[3696.64 → 3698.44] who has the authority
[3698.44 → 3699.22] to stand against
[3699.22 → 3699.90] the violence
[3699.90 → 3701.24] and the corruption
[3701.24 → 3702.56] and the death
[3702.56 → 3703.74] and the pain
[3703.74 → 3706.36] we need to learn
[3706.36 → 3707.10] how to sing
[3707.10 → 3708.66] like Mary
[3708.66 → 3710.92] defiantly
[3710.92 → 3713.20] patiently
[3713.20 → 3715.58] boldly
[3715.58 → 3717.08] sometimes even
[3717.08 → 3717.66] with tears
[3717.66 → 3718.50] in our eyes
[3718.50 → 3719.54] as we live
[3719.54 → 3720.22] in our own ways
[3720.22 → 3721.34] through relational pain
[3721.34 → 3722.80] sickness and death
[3722.80 → 3724.24] all sorts of things
[3724.24 → 3724.82] in our city
[3724.82 → 3725.88] that break our hearts
[3725.88 → 3727.38] we do so
[3727.38 → 3728.30] not without hope
[3728.30 → 3729.00] because the grave
[3729.00 → 3729.50] is empty
[3729.50 → 3731.06] but with hope
[3731.06 → 3731.54] because we know
[3731.54 → 3732.56] that Christ has come
[3732.56 → 3735.26] that Christ has conquered
[3735.26 → 3737.84] and Christ the King
[3737.84 → 3739.00] is coming again
[3739.00 → 3741.50] that ultimately
[3741.50 → 3743.64] is our Advent hope
[3743.64 → 3745.50] would you join me
[3745.50 → 3745.90] in prayer
[3745.90 → 3755.98] Father we acknowledge
[3755.98 → 3756.76] that it is hard
[3756.76 → 3757.78] for us to hope
[3757.78 → 3761.10] not only do we live
[3761.10 → 3762.42] in a culture
[3762.42 → 3763.56] obsessed with the present
[3763.56 → 3765.50] but we have all sorts
[3765.50 → 3766.04] of fears
[3766.04 → 3767.06] about the future
[3767.06 → 3769.42] all sorts of confusion
[3769.42 → 3770.34] about what will come
[3770.34 → 3772.56] and I pray
[3772.56 → 3773.62] that through this word
[3773.62 → 3774.96] this song of Mary
[3774.96 → 3776.34] you would fill us
[3776.34 → 3777.10] with confidence
[3777.10 → 3779.44] that Jesus the King
[3779.44 → 3780.04] has come
[3780.04 → 3782.34] and that he holds
[3782.34 → 3783.02] the keys
[3783.02 → 3783.66] of death
[3783.66 → 3784.18] and Hades
[3784.18 → 3786.54] we pray
[3786.54 → 3786.94] Jesus
[3786.94 → 3787.52] that you would
[3787.52 → 3788.38] come soon
[3788.38 → 3789.92] and you would
[3789.92 → 3791.14] heal this world
[3791.14 → 3793.18] that you would
[3793.18 → 3794.12] bring an end
[3794.12 → 3794.92] to oppression
[3794.92 → 3796.90] and violence
[3796.90 → 3798.22] and corruption
[3798.22 → 3799.70] and sickness
[3799.70 → 3801.16] and death
[3801.16 → 3803.62] Lord we want you
[3803.62 → 3804.90] to wipe our tears
[3804.90 → 3805.42] away
[3805.42 → 3807.68] and we want
[3807.68 → 3808.52] your shalom
[3808.52 → 3810.60] and so we pray
[3810.60 → 3811.30] with the church
[3811.30 → 3812.36] throughout the generations
[3812.36 → 3813.10] and the church
[3813.10 → 3813.80] throughout the world
[3813.80 → 3815.14] come soon
[3815.14 → 3815.90] Lord Jesus
[3815.90 → 3817.94] and heal your word
[3817.94 → 3819.34] Amen
[3819.34 → 3822.66] I invite you to stand
[3822.66 → 3823.50] and sing with me
[3823.50 → 3824.52] a song of hope
[3824.52 → 3826.10] that celebrates
[3826.10 → 3826.96] the faithfulness
[3826.96 → 3827.74] of our Lord
[3827.74 → 3846.08] Father of kindness
[3846.08 → 3849.54] you have poured out grace
[3849.54 → 3852.60] brought me out of darkness
[3852.60 → 3856.12] you have filled me with peace
[3856.12 → 3859.28] river of mercy
[3859.28 → 3861.06] on my love
[3861.06 → 3863.28] and time
[3863.28 → 3869.78] Lord I can't help
[3869.78 → 3871.10] but sing
[3871.10 → 3874.86] faithful
[3874.86 → 3878.06] you are
[3878.06 → 3881.34] faithful
[3881.34 → 3883.00] forever
[3883.00 → 3883.78] forever
[3883.78 → 3885.78] you will be
[3885.78 → 3887.82] faithful
[3887.82 → 3890.64] you are
[3890.64 → 3895.40] all your promises
[3895.40 → 3896.78] are yes
[3896.78 → 3897.72] and amen
[3897.72 → 3902.02] all your promises
[3902.02 → 3903.38] are yes
[3903.38 → 3904.34] and amen
[3904.34 → 3920.78] beautiful
[3920.78 → 3921.50] saviour
[3921.50 → 3924.28] you have brought me
[3924.28 → 3925.18] near
[3925.18 → 3928.16] pull me from the ashes
[3928.16 → 3930.00] you have broken
[3930.00 → 3931.78] every curse
[3931.78 → 3933.52] blessed
[3933.52 → 3933.60] blessed
[3933.60 → 3934.80] redeemer
[3934.80 → 3936.44] you have sent
[3936.44 → 3938.16] it's now
[3938.16 → 3939.90] to dream
[3939.90 → 3943.60] Lord I
[3943.60 → 3945.44] can't help
[3945.44 → 3946.94] but sing
[3946.94 → 3950.52] faithful
[3950.52 → 3953.00] you are
[3953.00 → 3957.00] faithful
[3957.00 → 3958.38] forever
[3958.38 → 3959.44] forever
[3959.44 → 3961.54] you will be
[3961.54 → 3962.16] faithful
[3962.16 → 3964.16] you are
[3964.16 → 3966.16] faithful
[3966.16 → 3966.54] you are
[3966.54 → 3971.36] all your promises
[3971.36 → 3972.16] are yes
[3972.16 → 3973.66] and amen
[3973.66 → 3977.96] all your promises
[3977.96 → 3979.38] are yes
[3979.38 → 3980.22] and amen
[3980.22 → 3982.68] here
[3982.68 → 3983.38] you are
[3983.38 → 3984.82] all your promises
[3984.82 → 3987.04] are
[3987.04 → 3987.70] yes
[3987.70 → 3987.80] yes
[3994.44 → 3995.84] amen
[3995.84 → 3997.02] who widen
[3997.02 → 3997.14] could gain
[3997.14 → 3999.10] but Harmon
[3999.10 → 4001.06] you are
[4001.06 → 4001.70] you are
[4001.70 → 4002.00] solid
[4002.00 → 4002.54] you are
[4002.54 → 4003.02] heaven
[4003.02 → 4003.52] who widen
[4003.52 → 4005.04] you know
[4005.04 → 4005.46] I am
[4005.46 → 4006.84] you are
[4006.84 → 4007.14] google
[4007.14 → 4013.44] I will rest in your promises.
[4014.16 → 4020.14] My confidence is in faithfulness.
[4020.94 → 4026.52] I will rest in your promises.
[4027.34 → 4033.14] My confidence is in faithfulness.
[4033.14 → 4039.54] I will rest in your promises.
[4040.32 → 4047.14] My confidence is in faithfulness.
[4048.02 → 4052.14] Faithful you are.
[4054.30 → 4060.22] Faithful forever you will be.
[4060.22 → 4065.42] Faithful you are.
[4067.30 → 4072.54] All your promises are yes and amen.
[4074.00 → 4079.10] All your promises are yes and amen.
[4079.10 → 4085.80] All your promises are yes and amen.
[4086.18 → 4092.42] All your promises are yes and amen.
[4092.42 → 4093.42] Amen.
[4099.50 → 4105.14] I thought I should let you know that in the first service, I rebuked them for stealing all the bread two weeks ago.
[4106.20 → 4112.34] We had Melanie come up and share a story of taking Cobb's bread, inviting people over for meals, and then the first service stole all the bread.
[4112.34 → 4117.96] So there should be bread for you to take home, invite your neighbours over, and enjoy hospitality together.
[4118.22 → 4121.14] If there's not, I'll have to do another rebuke in two weeks' time.
[4121.14 → 4127.44] Brothers and sisters, don't take for granted the gift of hope.
[4127.44 → 4136.50] That no matter how dark things feel, no matter how broken our world is, the grave is empty, and the future is secure.
[4136.90 → 4144.88] And we go into our workplaces, into our neighbourhoods, and into our schools as ambassadors of hope.
[4145.76 → 4149.66] I want to read a word for us as a blessing that comes from 1 Thessalonians.
[4149.72 → 4151.62] It's a book all about waiting for Jesus.
[4152.22 → 4155.44] And this is how Paul finishes this letter to the Thessalonians.
[4155.44 → 4161.84] May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through.
[4162.50 → 4169.22] May your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[4169.62 → 4173.94] The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it.
[4174.30 → 4179.34] And then Paul finishes, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
[4179.76 → 4180.08] Amen.
[4180.64 → 4184.22] We're going to sing Mary's song one more time as our closing song of worship.
[4185.44 → 4208.00] My soul magnifies the Lord.
[4208.00 → 4212.96] My spirit rejoices in God.
[4212.96 → 4218.14] My Saviour has seen His servant indeed.
[4218.14 → 4222.26] And behold the great things He has done.
[4223.38 → 4227.36] He scatters the proud and rich.
[4227.84 → 4232.46] He lifts the humble and weak.
[4232.46 → 4238.14] The kings of the earth He casts from their thrones.
[4238.24 → 4242.24] And the hungry He welcomes to feast.
[4242.68 → 4246.82] Oh, behold my Saviour has come.
[4247.20 → 4252.20] And my soul will tell of His praise.
[4252.60 → 4257.48] For He who is strong has come to the weak.
[4257.48 → 4264.28] And at last He will reign as our King of weeks.
[4264.28 → 4276.42] From now to the end of time.
[4276.42 → 4278.42] The nations will know He has come.
[4278.42 → 4281.34] The nations will know me as blessed.
[4281.34 → 4290.70] For God has made new His promise of love and mercy through Abraham's seed.
[4290.70 → 4292.70] Oh, behold my Saviour has come.
[4292.70 → 4294.70] Oh, behold my Saviour has come.
[4294.70 → 4299.70] And my soul will tell of His praise.
[4299.70 → 4305.98] For He who is strong has come to the weak.
[4305.98 → 4309.04] And at last He will reign as our King.
[4309.04 → 4314.04] Oh, behold my Saviour has come.
[4314.04 → 4315.04] Oh, behold my Saviour has come.
[4315.04 → 4321.04] And my soul will tell of His praise.
[4321.04 → 4326.04] Oh, behold my Saviour has come.
[4326.04 → 4331.04] And my soul will tell of His praise.
[4331.04 → 4337.04] For He who is strong has come to the weak.
[4337.04 → 4345.04] And at last He will reign as our King of kings.
[4345.04 → 4361.04] And at last He will reign as our King of kings.
[4361.04 → 4363.04] Go in peace.
