[0.00 → 8.26] It is my privilege to welcome our guest preacher for today, Pastor Tim Sheridan.
[8.64 → 12.42] He's a church planting leader for Resonate Global Mission.
[13.08 → 17.42] And this mission organization is part of our denomination of the CRC.
[17.96 → 26.20] And so he is a denominational officer who has graciously come to us.
[26.20 → 32.26] He has also occasionally come and worshipped with us, so he might be a familiar face to you.
[33.00 → 37.74] He's also a professor of congregational theology at the Mission Training Centre in Phoenix.
[38.38 → 44.62] And he has served in pastoral ministry for over 20 years in the U.S. and Canada,
[45.16 → 47.76] obviously being involved in church planting in both countries.
[48.48 → 51.26] Right now he lives in Maple Ridge, which is not too far.
[51.26 → 56.98] And so we are gifted with his presence as he brings God's word to us.
[57.46 → 61.80] He lives in Maple Ridge with his wife, Andrea, and two young adult children.
[62.28 → 66.14] And they have a total of four children and one son-in-law.
[66.86 → 70.64] So we get to be blessed with Tim's message this morning.
[70.76 → 74.70] And I pray that God would open our hearts and our ears to receive his message.
[75.00 → 76.32] So we welcome Pastor Tim.
[78.12 → 78.60] Thanks.
[80.26 → 81.04] Thanks, Jonathan.
[81.26 → 88.82] It's a real privilege and joy to be with you this morning and to open up God's word together.
[91.16 → 95.74] Before we read the passage that I've been drawn to this morning,
[95.74 → 98.70] I want to just begin with some reflections.
[104.92 → 110.94] Over the last couple of years, I've heard a variation of this phrase,
[110.94 → 111.72] many times, many times.
[113.72 → 118.02] What a strange world we're living in.
[121.56 → 123.80] What a strange world we're living in.
[123.80 → 134.16] It's an attempt by many to express, I think, what many of us have felt at some point over the last several years,
[134.28 → 141.06] that there's just a growing sense of unease or restlessness that finds us sometimes.
[142.14 → 145.58] As we witness the kinds of things going on in our world these days.
[145.58 → 152.98] For many, it can feel like the ground underneath our feet is a bit unstable, a bit shifting.
[152.98 → 158.60] And that seems to have been going on for a bit of time.
[160.60 → 164.08] Remember when we used to talk this way?
[164.08 → 171.78] This was several years ago as the global pandemic began.
[171.90 → 173.10] We used to say stuff like this.
[173.48 → 178.48] I wonder what the new normal will be like on the other side of this global pandemic.
[180.46 → 182.12] Anybody remember talking that way?
[182.12 → 188.38] I don't know about you, but I feel like one of my young kids on a long road trip right now in the backseat.
[188.60 → 189.42] Are we there yet?
[192.62 → 194.12] Is this the new normal?
[198.12 → 206.16] The deep divisions that have been exposed over the past several years seem to continue to pile up.
[206.16 → 211.00] Will there be an end to them?
[211.70 → 214.48] Or will they continue to multiply?
[214.66 → 218.68] Will we find ourselves increasingly divided over more and more issues?
[221.54 → 225.86] What's more, the things that Christianity stands for,
[227.04 → 229.38] at least as far as the public perception goes,
[230.68 → 232.74] also seems to have changed.
[232.74 → 241.24] I would guess that if you ask the average Canadian to describe a Christian today,
[242.14 → 245.94] I might not want to be one.
[246.34 → 248.36] At least not the one that they would describe.
[251.64 → 256.00] This is one of many contested questions in our society today.
[257.70 → 262.28] And a word that's been thrown around a bit over the past few years
[262.28 → 265.80] to help make sense of this kind of space we find ourselves in
[265.80 → 267.96] is this word liminal.
[268.30 → 270.92] L-I-M-I-N-A-L.
[271.04 → 271.40] Liminal.
[273.68 → 277.56] We're told by many that we're living in a liminal time.
[277.64 → 278.44] Now what does that mean?
[279.00 → 281.76] Quite simply, it means an in-between kind of time.
[281.86 → 283.06] An in-between kind of time.
[284.94 → 288.72] A time when we can look back, and we can see where we've come from.
[288.72 → 291.52] But what is no more?
[292.88 → 298.10] And a time when we know that we're heading somewhere different from the past,
[298.20 → 301.48] but we don't yet know what that future somewhere is.
[302.60 → 305.40] So we're in-between what was and what will be.
[307.50 → 312.64] Some have described this like waiting at the terminal gate at the airport.
[312.64 → 317.18] So if you look at the image here, this is just a lovely terminal gate, is it not?
[317.98 → 318.76] Gate B9.
[322.16 → 324.56] And here's the thing about a terminal gate like B9.
[324.68 → 332.30] If you're sitting there in the waiting area and on the sign it says Maui departs in 60 minutes,
[332.92 → 335.36] that's probably not a bad place to be, eh?
[335.36 → 338.72] I mean, that's 60 minutes, probably won't go long.
[338.80 → 340.26] Just go get yourself a Tim Hortons.
[340.58 → 341.70] Hit the washroom one more time.
[341.76 → 342.98] Before you know it, they'll be boarding.
[345.94 → 347.56] But that's not a liminal space.
[348.46 → 349.68] Because you know where you're going.
[351.00 → 352.08] No, it's more like this.
[352.10 → 355.46] You're sitting at B9 and the sign's blank.
[357.80 → 360.60] You don't know where you're going to go when you walk through that gate.
[360.60 → 365.38] And not only is the sign blank, but the plane isn't there.
[366.72 → 368.78] And you have no idea when it's going to show up.
[370.64 → 374.90] And not only that, but like every good airline, when things are congested and chaotic,
[375.04 → 376.36] they're not saying anything to you.
[379.78 → 383.78] So you really have no idea how much longer you're going to have to sit at B9,
[384.54 → 386.68] waiting to go who knows where.
[387.64 → 389.96] He starts to feel not so fun, eh?
[390.60 → 393.08] Maybe this is an episode of The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror.
[395.56 → 397.62] You see, liminal spaces are hard.
[398.64 → 400.02] In between spaces.
[400.88 → 404.66] And living with the levels of uncertainty that we've had to live with
[404.66 → 407.22] over the past few years is difficult.
[410.72 → 413.60] Hopelessness about the future being better,
[413.60 → 419.52] even being sustainable is on the rise.
[420.92 → 423.92] I listen to some of my young adult kids,
[424.72 → 427.80] and I think about what life was like when I was their age.
[429.00 → 432.46] I'm noticing that they don't have as much hope as I had at their age
[432.46 → 433.60] for the future being better.
[433.60 → 436.84] And they're not alone in that.
[439.42 → 442.82] And many in the lower mainland have very little hope,
[442.98 → 444.90] probably zero hope that they'll ever own a home.
[444.90 → 452.80] Now what do all these things have in common?
[453.82 → 454.70] You might be thinking,
[455.08 → 456.68] where on earth is this pastor going?
[458.20 → 459.12] There's a thread
[459.12 → 463.20] that weaves its way through these musings.
[463.74 → 464.88] And what is that thread?
[465.02 → 468.18] It's this deep human longing for home.
[468.18 → 471.42] And that's what I want to speak about this morning.
[472.54 → 473.92] You hear that word,
[474.04 → 474.96] what is home?
[476.04 → 477.72] What comes to mind for you?
[481.48 → 484.84] How would you describe home?
[488.22 → 489.62] In the biblical story,
[490.48 → 493.66] home is an image for a place
[493.66 → 497.02] where life flourishes in the fullest sense.
[498.18 → 501.68] A place where our physical life and health
[501.68 → 503.16] is nourished and sustained.
[504.16 → 505.68] It's abundance of food,
[507.02 → 508.02] fine wine,
[509.10 → 509.66] a feast.
[511.36 → 514.62] Home is where our love relationships are nurtured.
[515.76 → 517.50] Home is this place where we belong,
[518.30 → 520.26] where we're safe, secure.
[523.70 → 525.34] It's a place of rest,
[526.04 → 527.70] a place of human flourishing.
[528.18 → 531.74] Now perhaps some of you,
[532.46 → 533.58] like myself,
[534.02 → 535.96] hear those words about home
[535.96 → 537.36] and it stirs something.
[538.06 → 539.58] Because it doesn't describe
[539.58 → 540.60] the home you grew up in.
[543.70 → 545.34] But even if it starts to
[545.34 → 547.56] get close to the kind of home
[547.56 → 548.92] you experienced growing up,
[548.98 → 550.56] there's still something inside
[550.56 → 552.18] the human spirit that longs
[552.18 → 554.68] for a home like that.
[554.68 → 557.62] Put another way,
[557.62 → 560.02] each of us in some way
[560.02 → 561.24] at some point in our lives
[561.24 → 563.82] will experience a level of homesickness.
[563.82 → 567.66] And I believe
[567.66 → 570.40] that when we find ourselves
[570.40 → 571.60] in these prolonged times
[571.60 → 572.60] of unrest,
[573.60 → 577.16] there's an invitation
[577.16 → 579.60] to listen deeply
[579.60 → 581.32] to the longings and desires
[581.32 → 584.34] that are being stirred inside of us.
[584.34 → 586.34] And that's what I want to do
[586.34 → 587.02] with you this morning
[587.02 → 587.98] through God's word
[587.98 → 588.80] is let's listen
[588.80 → 591.04] to those longings and desires.
[591.04 → 591.96] Let's bring them
[591.96 → 593.48] to God's word this morning.
[594.22 → 595.66] Now before I read our text,
[596.62 → 598.36] I just want to say a few words
[598.36 → 599.48] by way of context.
[599.68 → 600.36] I'm going to be reading
[600.36 → 601.62] from the book of Revelation.
[601.62 → 604.42] One of the primary questions
[604.42 → 605.66] that this book is after
[605.66 → 607.16] is the question,
[607.34 → 608.96] who is the Lord of the world?
[611.44 → 613.04] And that was a burning question
[613.04 → 613.66] for the people
[613.66 → 614.60] who would have read this book
[614.60 → 615.52] for the first time
[615.52 → 616.66] because here's some
[616.66 → 617.98] of the realities they faced.
[618.68 → 619.70] They faced a world
[619.70 → 620.82] in which Christians
[620.82 → 623.00] were being persecuted and killed
[623.00 → 625.26] under the thumb
[625.26 → 626.38] of the Roman Empire.
[627.08 → 628.54] If you did not bow the knee
[628.54 → 629.72] to the Roman Emperor
[629.72 → 631.16] and acknowledge the Emperor
[631.16 → 632.68] as being a form of the gods,
[633.18 → 634.28] you would be thrown in jail
[634.28 → 635.10] or worse,
[635.20 → 636.18] you would be put to death.
[638.82 → 639.84] On top of that,
[639.92 → 640.78] the Roman Empire
[640.78 → 644.30] was unhinged,
[645.88 → 646.98] completely immoral
[646.98 → 649.64] in ways that would turn
[649.64 → 650.12] your stomach
[650.12 → 650.86] if I had the time
[650.86 → 651.56] to describe it.
[654.40 → 655.58] And yet many Christians
[655.58 → 656.96] were being seduced
[656.96 → 659.08] by the culture
[659.08 → 661.08] and the paganism of society.
[661.16 → 662.28] and the things
[662.28 → 663.40] that were celebrated.
[664.12 → 665.00] Not only that,
[665.08 → 665.96] there were false teachers
[665.96 → 666.68] going around
[666.68 → 668.12] this early Christian movement,
[668.64 → 669.46] taking it in all kinds
[669.46 → 670.22] of weird directions.
[672.14 → 673.36] And this small,
[673.54 → 674.68] fledgling church,
[675.62 → 676.88] this community of God's people
[676.88 → 678.22] living in that context,
[678.98 → 680.08] not only witnessed
[680.08 → 680.54] these things,
[680.62 → 681.54] but also witnessed
[681.54 → 682.62] what seemed to be
[682.62 → 683.60] the reality
[683.60 → 685.34] that all those pagans
[685.34 → 687.38] seemed to be getting on
[687.38 → 689.12] pretty decently in life
[689.12 → 689.84] without God.
[693.24 → 694.12] Sound it all?
[695.92 → 696.66] Like the world
[696.66 → 697.22] we might find
[697.22 → 697.94] ourselves in today?
[701.10 → 701.94] And part of what
[701.94 → 703.20] this book is trying to do
[703.20 → 705.98] is declared
[705.98 → 708.70] that despite all appearances,
[709.66 → 712.92] God still rules
[712.92 → 713.82] over his creation.
[713.82 → 716.28] And the time is coming
[716.28 → 717.44] that he will overthrow
[717.44 → 718.66] the evil empires.
[719.52 → 720.70] He will mend
[720.70 → 721.66] all that's broken.
[722.08 → 722.88] He will establish
[722.88 → 724.10] his kingdom on earth.
[724.20 → 725.58] It is certain to happen.
[725.58 → 729.28] God's people then
[729.28 → 730.44] and God's people now,
[730.58 → 730.94] us,
[731.94 → 733.98] need to hear that again,
[734.04 → 734.52] do we not?
[736.90 → 737.86] And then we come
[737.86 → 739.08] near the end of this book.
[739.16 → 739.88] It's a stunning book.
[739.96 → 741.08] We get this stunning picture
[741.08 → 743.64] that I want to read for us.
[745.84 → 747.48] Revelation 21, 1-5.
[748.38 → 749.92] Then I saw a new heaven
[749.92 → 750.80] and a new earth.
[751.80 → 753.06] For the first heaven
[753.06 → 753.86] and the first earth
[753.86 → 754.78] had passed away.
[755.58 → 757.28] And there was no longer
[757.28 → 757.92] any sea.
[759.24 → 760.12] I saw the holy city,
[760.22 → 760.82] the new Jerusalem,
[761.02 → 762.08] coming down out of heaven
[762.08 → 762.76] from God,
[763.58 → 764.58] prepared as a bride
[764.58 → 765.38] beautifully dressed
[765.38 → 766.00] for her husband.
[767.36 → 768.72] And I heard a loud voice
[768.72 → 769.80] from the throne saying,
[769.98 → 770.22] Look!
[771.16 → 772.36] God's dwelling place
[772.36 → 773.72] is now among the people
[773.72 → 775.82] and he will dwell with them.
[778.88 → 780.10] Go to the next slide.
[780.68 → 781.24] That'd be great.
[781.96 → 782.96] They will be his people
[782.96 → 784.76] and God himself
[784.76 → 785.76] will be with them
[785.76 → 786.74] and be their God.
[787.74 → 789.30] He will wipe every tear
[789.30 → 790.20] from their eyes.
[791.20 → 792.42] There will be no more death
[792.42 → 793.10] or mourning
[793.10 → 793.84] or crying
[793.84 → 794.50] or pain
[794.50 → 795.78] for the old order
[795.78 → 796.24] of things
[796.24 → 797.14] has passed away.
[798.20 → 799.04] He who was seated
[799.04 → 799.76] on the throne
[799.76 → 800.10] said,
[800.22 → 802.08] I am making everything new.
[803.38 → 804.30] Then he said,
[804.38 → 805.18] Write this down
[805.18 → 806.02] for these words
[806.02 → 806.66] are trustworthy
[806.66 → 807.86] and true.
[809.16 → 809.66] Amen.
[809.96 → 810.50] God's word.
[810.50 → 814.28] I want to submit
[814.28 → 814.98] to you this morning
[814.98 → 815.98] that what we have
[815.98 → 817.32] in these five verses
[817.32 → 818.22] is a picture
[818.22 → 820.60] of the home
[820.60 → 822.48] that our hearts long for.
[823.74 → 824.66] And I want to help you
[824.66 → 825.38] see that picture
[825.38 → 826.38] by just drawing
[826.38 → 827.02] your attention
[827.02 → 827.62] with me
[827.62 → 828.98] to some of the images
[828.98 → 829.84] that are used
[829.84 → 830.62] in this picture.
[832.76 → 833.20] First,
[833.84 → 834.72] notice with me
[834.72 → 835.36] our future
[835.36 → 836.50] and final home
[836.50 → 837.16] is a place
[837.16 → 838.64] of perfect security
[838.64 → 839.34] and peace.
[841.18 → 842.28] Now where do I get that
[842.28 → 842.98] you might be wondering.
[843.94 → 845.86] It comes in this phrase,
[846.36 → 846.82] this image,
[847.02 → 848.20] there was no longer
[848.20 → 849.68] any sea.
[853.14 → 854.02] Now why is that
[854.02 → 854.88] a picture of security
[854.88 → 855.40] and peace?
[856.86 → 858.00] In the ancient world
[858.00 → 859.02] in which this book
[859.02 → 859.48] is written,
[860.04 → 860.52] the sea
[860.52 → 862.08] was a place
[862.08 → 862.96] of chaos,
[863.54 → 863.94] a place,
[864.26 → 865.66] an unsettling place
[865.66 → 866.24] of evil.
[866.86 → 867.64] And in the type
[867.64 → 868.10] of literature
[868.10 → 869.04] that this book is,
[869.06 → 869.72] it was an image
[869.72 → 870.36] that was used
[870.36 → 870.86] repeatedly.
[871.06 → 871.66] So think with me
[871.66 → 872.16] for example,
[872.24 → 872.64] if you know
[872.64 → 873.50] the story
[873.50 → 874.26] from the Old Testament,
[874.38 → 875.12] the book of Daniel,
[875.78 → 876.50] there's a vision
[876.50 → 877.72] of these wild beasts
[877.72 → 878.78] that emerge,
[879.14 → 879.80] four of them,
[881.30 → 881.98] representing these
[881.98 → 883.52] powerful oppressive empires.
[883.70 → 884.38] Where do they come from?
[884.42 → 885.18] They come from the sea.
[886.42 → 887.58] Earlier in this book,
[887.64 → 888.96] there's also crazy beasts
[888.96 → 890.34] and dragons.
[891.12 → 892.28] And it's really cool,
[892.40 → 892.78] but guess where
[892.78 → 893.36] they come from?
[893.40 → 893.84] The sea.
[893.84 → 898.04] And there was something
[898.04 → 898.96] about the sea
[898.96 → 900.20] and the ancient world
[900.20 → 901.92] that was unsettling,
[902.06 → 902.66] unnerving,
[903.96 → 905.40] represented the chaotic
[905.40 → 906.48] forces of evil.
[909.00 → 910.42] And John's imagery
[910.42 → 912.60] of this final future home,
[913.56 → 914.22] it's significant
[914.22 → 915.28] that the sea is gone.
[915.28 → 918.02] Now some of you
[918.02 → 918.68] might be thinking,
[919.42 → 920.94] huh,
[921.40 → 923.08] how is that good news?
[923.16 → 924.30] I quite like the ocean.
[925.74 → 926.68] It's an image.
[927.44 → 928.24] It's an image.
[930.48 → 931.62] This is not a promise
[931.62 → 932.72] that on the new creation,
[932.88 → 933.98] all the oceans are gone.
[937.24 → 939.06] Makes me think of a conversation
[939.06 → 940.02] I've had many times
[940.02 → 940.58] with my wife.
[940.58 → 942.64] I love the ocean.
[943.32 → 945.12] I find the roar of the waves
[945.12 → 946.72] crashing on the beach,
[946.88 → 947.16] soothing.
[947.90 → 949.22] I could walk for hours.
[949.32 → 949.56] In fact,
[949.60 → 951.40] I often have sunburns
[951.40 → 952.86] are evidence of that
[952.86 → 953.74] along the water.
[954.60 → 956.06] My wife gets to the water,
[956.18 → 957.62] the ocean hears the thundering
[957.62 → 958.20] of the waves
[958.20 → 959.14] and it unsettles her.
[961.08 → 962.18] And that's a bit how it was
[962.18 → 962.98] for ancient people.
[963.86 → 965.84] The sea was a scary place.
[967.32 → 968.24] But notice with me,
[968.30 → 969.28] let's go back to the text.
[969.28 → 970.90] Everything that's touched
[970.90 → 971.92] and broken by evil
[971.92 → 973.20] is healed and made right.
[974.68 → 975.24] A new heaven,
[975.32 → 975.76] a new earth,
[975.82 → 976.26] we're told.
[977.48 → 979.18] I will make everything new,
[979.28 → 979.90] John declares.
[980.74 → 982.00] Everything that's been twisted
[982.00 → 983.44] and broken by sin
[983.44 → 984.28] is going to be healed
[984.28 → 985.44] and touched and restored.
[986.34 → 987.12] And not only that,
[987.16 → 988.02] but we will enjoy
[988.02 → 989.52] the presence of God forever.
[990.54 → 991.74] Now the dwelling of God
[991.74 → 992.40] is with us.
[992.48 → 994.88] He will live with us.
[994.96 → 995.90] We will be his people.
[996.12 → 997.70] God himself will be our God.
[997.70 → 1000.70] God with us.
[1001.50 → 1002.06] Emmanuel.
[1003.10 → 1003.60] Forever.
[1006.08 → 1007.26] And then notice,
[1008.26 → 1010.66] to use the words of J.R. Tolkien,
[1012.14 → 1013.50] everything that's sad
[1013.50 → 1015.90] about this world,
[1016.90 → 1018.42] about our lives,
[1018.98 → 1021.26] will no longer be true.
[1021.26 → 1025.60] And this intimate,
[1025.72 → 1027.00] this intimate,
[1027.18 → 1028.02] tender image
[1028.02 → 1030.86] that God himself
[1030.86 → 1032.94] will wipe
[1032.94 → 1035.06] with every tear
[1035.06 → 1035.90] from our eyes.
[1037.98 → 1039.26] Absolutely stunning
[1039.26 → 1040.98] image
[1040.98 → 1043.50] that God would stoop down
[1043.50 → 1044.64] and wipe our tears.
[1045.58 → 1046.64] No more death.
[1046.64 → 1048.82] No more crying.
[1048.94 → 1049.66] No more pain.
[1050.60 → 1051.68] The old things
[1051.68 → 1052.68] that passed away.
[1053.32 → 1054.36] They're no longer true.
[1057.08 → 1058.66] Is your heart being stirred
[1058.66 → 1059.76] as you sit with this image
[1059.76 → 1060.28] this morning?
[1061.62 → 1062.40] A future
[1062.40 → 1063.78] peace
[1063.78 → 1064.74] and security,
[1064.96 → 1065.40] intimacy
[1065.40 → 1066.24] with our maker
[1066.24 → 1066.94] and redeemer.
[1067.46 → 1068.36] Everything healed
[1068.36 → 1069.24] and renewed
[1069.24 → 1070.16] in the presence
[1070.16 → 1070.74] of a God
[1070.74 → 1071.46] who loves us
[1071.46 → 1072.86] and delights in us.
[1073.12 → 1073.92] No shame,
[1074.04 → 1074.66] no guilt.
[1074.66 → 1075.80] everything sad,
[1075.90 → 1076.32] untrue.
[1076.46 → 1077.72] God wiping our tears
[1077.72 → 1078.82] away with his hands.
[1080.32 → 1082.12] What an amazing picture
[1082.12 → 1084.46] of our future
[1084.46 → 1085.36] and final home.
[1087.66 → 1088.58] A home
[1088.58 → 1090.08] that we long for
[1090.08 → 1090.80] deep inside.
[1094.22 → 1095.34] And I want to suggest
[1095.34 → 1095.82] this morning
[1095.82 → 1097.70] as we continue
[1097.70 → 1099.20] that if we allow
[1099.20 → 1101.60] this longing
[1101.60 → 1102.46] and hunger
[1102.46 → 1103.84] for our home,
[1103.84 → 1105.50] our future home,
[1105.72 → 1106.62] if we allow that
[1106.62 → 1108.12] to stir in our spirits,
[1108.70 → 1109.54] it will lead us
[1109.54 → 1110.60] down two paths.
[1111.36 → 1112.12] Two paths
[1112.12 → 1112.66] that we're invited
[1112.66 → 1113.40] to live down
[1113.40 → 1114.04] as a Christian.
[1115.00 → 1115.60] Two things
[1115.60 → 1116.10] that mark
[1116.10 → 1117.04] the Christian life
[1117.04 → 1117.76] and that's what
[1117.76 → 1118.34] I want to spend
[1118.34 → 1119.08] the rest of our time
[1119.08 → 1119.80] looking at together.
[1119.94 → 1120.84] On the one hand,
[1122.14 → 1123.14] this longing
[1123.14 → 1124.22] for our future home
[1124.22 → 1125.72] gives us good reasons
[1125.72 → 1127.20] to be attached
[1127.20 → 1127.92] to this world
[1127.92 → 1128.46] and to work
[1128.46 → 1129.08] for it's good.
[1129.08 → 1132.76] notice our future home
[1132.76 → 1133.88] is a home
[1133.88 → 1134.88] where heaven
[1134.88 → 1135.90] comes down,
[1136.70 → 1137.40] where heaven
[1137.40 → 1137.88] and earth
[1137.88 → 1138.74] become one.
[1141.82 → 1143.10] Heaven is the renewal
[1143.10 → 1144.52] of this world.
[1147.10 → 1148.50] Hear that clearly.
[1149.88 → 1151.06] Heaven is not
[1151.06 → 1153.60] an alternative world
[1153.60 → 1154.54] that we escape
[1154.54 → 1155.30] this one
[1155.30 → 1156.00] and head to.
[1156.00 → 1158.42] Rather,
[1158.58 → 1159.16] heaven is where
[1159.16 → 1160.38] God is.
[1160.46 → 1161.10] It's the environment
[1161.10 → 1162.00] of God's glory,
[1162.12 → 1162.96] of God's presence
[1162.96 → 1164.74] and it's an atmosphere
[1164.74 → 1165.88] of the glory of God
[1165.88 → 1166.54] that heals
[1166.54 → 1167.64] everything it touches
[1167.64 → 1168.44] so when heaven
[1168.44 → 1169.58] comes down
[1169.58 → 1170.32] and heaven
[1170.32 → 1170.84] and earth
[1170.84 → 1171.52] are one,
[1172.18 → 1173.22] earth is healed
[1173.22 → 1173.86] and renewed.
[1176.84 → 1177.90] And because heaven
[1177.90 → 1178.38] is the healing
[1178.38 → 1179.18] of this world,
[1179.88 → 1181.32] we have good reasons
[1181.32 → 1182.08] to be attached
[1182.08 → 1182.64] to this world
[1182.64 → 1183.26] and to work
[1183.26 → 1184.44] for it's good.
[1185.88 → 1186.36] You know,
[1186.40 → 1186.88] I grew up
[1186.88 → 1188.68] in an environment
[1188.68 → 1189.84] where I was exposed
[1189.84 → 1191.44] different times
[1191.44 → 1192.06] of my life
[1192.06 → 1192.72] to a version
[1192.72 → 1193.52] of Christianity
[1193.52 → 1196.04] that had a phrase
[1196.04 → 1196.58] that went something
[1196.58 → 1197.26] like this.
[1198.30 → 1198.68] Christians
[1198.68 → 1200.38] should be
[1200.38 → 1201.64] so heavenly minded
[1201.64 → 1203.70] that they're
[1203.70 → 1204.98] of no earthly good.
[1207.48 → 1208.96] I remember hearing that.
[1211.16 → 1211.68] Thinking,
[1211.68 → 1212.00] man,
[1212.72 → 1213.22] that's,
[1213.92 → 1215.18] that seems
[1215.18 → 1215.84] a bit odd.
[1217.72 → 1218.58] It seemed
[1218.58 → 1219.58] to be inviting me
[1219.58 → 1220.18] into a way
[1220.18 → 1220.68] of life
[1220.68 → 1221.24] in which my
[1221.24 → 1221.96] Christian faith
[1221.96 → 1222.84] was separated
[1222.84 → 1223.82] from the rest
[1223.82 → 1224.48] of my life.
[1226.00 → 1226.76] And quite frankly,
[1226.82 → 1227.60] it wasn't compelling,
[1227.78 → 1228.62] it wasn't attractive.
[1230.02 → 1231.20] So heavenly minded
[1231.20 → 1232.34] I have no earthly good?
[1232.42 → 1233.18] Are you kidding me?
[1234.76 → 1235.88] And I walked away
[1235.88 → 1238.12] from the Christian faith
[1238.12 → 1240.00] when it was presented
[1240.00 → 1240.74] to me that way.
[1241.68 → 1245.86] it would take years
[1245.86 → 1246.70] for me to realize
[1246.70 → 1247.84] that the logic
[1247.84 → 1249.40] of the biblical story
[1249.40 → 1250.62] runs counter to that.
[1251.22 → 1252.00] Quite frankly,
[1252.14 → 1254.30] it runs in the opposite direction
[1254.30 → 1254.80] and Christians
[1254.80 → 1255.62] throughout history
[1255.62 → 1256.88] have rightly understood
[1256.88 → 1257.86] that because heaven
[1257.86 → 1258.60] is the restoration
[1258.60 → 1259.66] of this world,
[1260.32 → 1261.76] we have good reasons
[1261.76 → 1262.48] to be attached
[1262.48 → 1263.02] to this world,
[1263.08 → 1263.68] to love it,
[1263.84 → 1264.52] and to work
[1264.52 → 1265.26] for the good
[1265.26 → 1265.92] of this world
[1265.92 → 1266.98] and this people.
[1266.98 → 1268.98] In fact,
[1269.62 → 1270.44] I want to just share
[1270.44 → 1271.40] a bit of a story
[1271.40 → 1271.76] with you
[1271.76 → 1272.30] from the early
[1272.30 → 1273.26] Christian communities.
[1274.10 → 1275.12] A great example
[1275.12 → 1276.58] of what this looked like
[1276.58 → 1277.26] early on
[1277.26 → 1278.18] as the Christian community
[1278.18 → 1278.90] began to grow
[1278.90 → 1279.74] in the Roman Empire.
[1281.98 → 1282.82] Rodney Stark
[1282.82 → 1283.70] in his important book
[1283.70 → 1284.48] called The Rise
[1284.48 → 1285.56] of Christianity
[1285.56 → 1286.54] tells the story.
[1287.24 → 1287.96] It's a book
[1287.96 → 1288.66] where he's trying
[1288.66 → 1289.72] to answer this question
[1289.72 → 1290.50] as a historian.
[1291.34 → 1291.80] It's a really
[1291.80 → 1293.08] fascinating question.
[1293.08 → 1294.42] Why did Christianity
[1294.42 → 1296.32] succeed in the Roman Empire?
[1298.22 → 1299.02] All the things
[1299.02 → 1299.96] I said a few moments ago
[1299.96 → 1300.40] were true.
[1301.50 → 1302.42] Christians were killed.
[1303.26 → 1303.78] They didn't bow
[1303.78 → 1304.88] the knee to Rome.
[1305.94 → 1306.98] It was a wildly
[1306.98 → 1307.82] unhinged,
[1307.90 → 1308.80] immoral society.
[1310.16 → 1311.50] Lots of variations
[1311.50 → 1312.80] of teaching going on,
[1312.86 → 1313.28] leading people
[1313.28 → 1314.18] down weird paths.
[1315.50 → 1316.92] So why is it
[1316.92 → 1318.18] that Christianity
[1318.18 → 1319.66] succeeded in an environment
[1319.66 → 1320.26] like that?
[1320.88 → 1321.58] That's the question
[1321.58 → 1322.10] he's after.
[1323.08 → 1324.36] Why did Christianity
[1324.36 → 1325.12] in a little over
[1325.12 → 1325.78] 100 years
[1325.78 → 1326.76] grow from being
[1326.76 → 1328.08] about 6%
[1328.08 → 1328.94] of the Roman Empire
[1328.94 → 1330.12] to about 50%?
[1333.32 → 1334.56] And part of the story
[1334.56 → 1335.02] is this.
[1335.08 → 1335.52] There were two
[1335.52 → 1336.32] great plagues
[1336.32 → 1337.70] that swept through
[1337.70 → 1338.42] the Roman Empire.
[1339.50 → 1340.58] The first plague
[1340.58 → 1342.12] lasted about 15 years.
[1344.18 → 1345.46] About 90 years later
[1345.46 → 1346.60] a second plague came.
[1346.68 → 1347.24] It lasted,
[1347.48 → 1347.86] guess what,
[1347.92 → 1349.10] another 15 years.
[1350.70 → 1351.28] Now let's just do
[1351.28 → 1352.34] a reality check a moment.
[1353.08 → 1354.58] July 2,
[1354.88 → 1355.84] 2023.
[1357.20 → 1358.82] Three and a half years ago,
[1359.68 → 1360.24] something called
[1360.24 → 1361.30] COVID-19 started.
[1362.68 → 1363.56] Three and a half.
[1365.48 → 1367.64] 15 years.
[1368.72 → 1370.52] Two successive plagues,
[1370.98 → 1371.92] 15 years,
[1372.62 → 1374.08] absolutely decimated
[1374.08 → 1375.52] the Roman Empire.
[1375.52 → 1377.00] at the height
[1377.00 → 1377.88] of the second plague,
[1377.96 → 1379.52] about 35,000 people
[1379.52 → 1380.68] were dying each week
[1380.68 → 1382.20] in the Roman world.
[1383.16 → 1383.96] By the time
[1383.96 → 1384.74] that second plague
[1384.74 → 1385.40] was done,
[1385.76 → 1387.34] about 25 to 30%
[1387.34 → 1388.14] of the population
[1388.14 → 1388.98] was wiped out.
[1391.18 → 1391.96] Imagine with me
[1391.96 → 1392.28] where you,
[1392.42 → 1393.38] think about where you live.
[1393.46 → 1394.40] Maybe it's a cul-de-sac,
[1394.52 → 1395.14] maybe it's a home,
[1395.24 → 1396.38] maybe it's an apartment building,
[1396.46 → 1397.38] I don't know where you live,
[1397.78 → 1398.98] but just picture that place
[1398.98 → 1399.46] for a moment
[1399.46 → 1400.50] and imagine a quarter
[1400.50 → 1401.34] or a third
[1401.34 → 1402.16] of the people gone.
[1402.16 → 1403.16] devastating.
[1406.66 → 1407.14] Devastating.
[1411.14 → 1412.76] And the Roman people
[1412.76 → 1413.42] at the time
[1413.42 → 1415.46] didn't have
[1415.46 → 1416.50] the scientific developments
[1416.50 → 1417.00] we have,
[1417.06 → 1417.58] they didn't have
[1417.58 → 1418.22] the capacity
[1418.22 → 1419.90] to really study
[1419.90 → 1421.04] like what's causing this
[1421.04 → 1421.62] and let's develop
[1421.62 → 1422.24] a vaccine,
[1422.60 → 1423.12] but here's what
[1423.12 → 1423.68] they did know,
[1424.24 → 1425.00] it was passed
[1425.00 → 1426.04] by human contact.
[1426.04 → 1430.80] And so if you had money,
[1432.12 → 1432.82] if you had power
[1432.82 → 1433.88] or influence,
[1435.38 → 1436.64] you stayed away
[1436.64 → 1437.16] from people
[1437.16 → 1438.10] and you left the city.
[1438.80 → 1439.60] You got out.
[1441.92 → 1442.84] You'd even leave
[1442.84 → 1443.70] behind your family.
[1445.80 → 1446.60] So the cities
[1446.60 → 1447.50] were left
[1447.50 → 1448.62] with the sick
[1448.62 → 1449.82] who were dying.
[1452.82 → 1453.82] The Christians,
[1453.82 → 1455.66] the Christians,
[1455.66 → 1456.06] the Christians stayed
[1456.06 → 1456.60] in the city.
[1458.20 → 1458.84] And the Christians
[1458.84 → 1459.72] became notorious
[1459.72 → 1460.92] not only for caring
[1460.92 → 1462.28] for their own sick,
[1463.12 → 1464.16] but for mobilizing
[1464.16 → 1465.14] nursing services
[1465.14 → 1466.12] to tend and care
[1466.12 → 1467.08] for the sick of others
[1467.08 → 1467.74] who were abandoned.
[1469.12 → 1470.02] And the Christians
[1470.02 → 1471.06] didn't get a pass
[1471.06 → 1471.98] on the transmission
[1471.98 → 1472.70] of these plagues.
[1473.08 → 1474.20] Many, many Christians
[1474.20 → 1475.40] lost their lives.
[1480.04 → 1481.42] So what was the difference?
[1481.42 → 1483.82] That's the question
[1483.82 → 1485.16] that this historian's after.
[1485.50 → 1486.70] Why did they act
[1486.70 → 1487.32] so differently?
[1489.24 → 1490.24] What he demonstrates
[1490.24 → 1490.82] in his book
[1490.82 → 1491.70] is because they had
[1491.70 → 1492.72] two different types
[1492.72 → 1493.26] of beliefs.
[1495.04 → 1495.72] The Greeks
[1495.72 → 1496.36] and the Romans
[1496.36 → 1497.30] by and large
[1497.30 → 1498.56] did not believe
[1498.56 → 1498.98] that there was
[1498.98 → 1499.48] an afterlife.
[1500.92 → 1502.32] And if there was one,
[1502.40 → 1503.06] it wasn't good.
[1504.52 → 1505.56] Bottom line is,
[1505.70 → 1506.56] this is your life.
[1506.62 → 1507.54] You get one life.
[1507.94 → 1508.58] Live it well.
[1508.90 → 1509.80] Do everything you can
[1509.80 → 1511.16] to not die prematurely.
[1511.42 → 1512.26] Because it's it.
[1517.26 → 1518.42] An ancient belief
[1518.42 → 1518.82] and perhaps
[1518.82 → 1519.68] a contemporary one.
[1522.42 → 1523.16] The Christians.
[1524.26 → 1525.62] The Christians believed
[1525.62 → 1527.16] that there's a better world
[1527.16 → 1528.08] one day that's coming.
[1528.98 → 1529.98] And it's going to fill
[1529.98 → 1530.40] this earth
[1530.40 → 1531.08] with its glory.
[1532.20 → 1533.12] And Christians knew
[1533.12 → 1533.96] that this world
[1533.96 → 1534.58] would be renewed
[1534.58 → 1535.22] and restored.
[1535.70 → 1536.08] They knew that
[1536.08 → 1536.90] this world mattered,
[1536.98 → 1537.82] that God himself
[1537.82 → 1538.90] took on human flesh
[1538.90 → 1539.42] and blood
[1539.42 → 1540.36] and one day
[1540.36 → 1541.08] was going to return
[1541.08 → 1541.94] in the same form.
[1544.26 → 1545.08] And so because
[1545.08 → 1547.00] they believed
[1547.00 → 1547.80] those things,
[1548.42 → 1549.60] they stayed
[1549.60 → 1550.26] in the city
[1550.26 → 1551.88] and they worked
[1551.88 → 1552.36] for the good
[1552.36 → 1552.90] of the city
[1552.90 → 1554.66] and they sacrificed
[1554.66 → 1556.08] even their lives
[1556.08 → 1558.36] to serve
[1558.36 → 1559.92] the city
[1559.92 → 1560.66] that they loved.
[1560.66 → 1562.26] and as a result
[1562.26 → 1563.22] of that sacrifice
[1563.22 → 1564.22] the Christian movement
[1564.22 → 1565.04] began to grow
[1565.04 → 1566.00] like wildfire.
[1567.40 → 1568.74] Who are these people
[1568.74 → 1569.98] that they would risk
[1569.98 → 1570.58] their lives
[1570.58 → 1571.28] for our sake?
[1571.28 → 1576.28] We have much
[1576.28 → 1576.88] to learn
[1576.88 → 1578.92] from these early Christians.
[1582.30 → 1583.28] I was reminded
[1583.28 → 1584.16] of a friend
[1584.16 → 1584.78] I got to see
[1584.78 → 1585.58] this past week.
[1585.70 → 1586.02] I was
[1586.02 → 1588.94] in Smithfield,
[1589.14 → 1589.86] North Carolina.
[1592.20 → 1593.12] And in Smithfield,
[1593.24 → 1593.90] North Carolina,
[1594.06 → 1594.50] if you had
[1594.50 → 1595.84] driven into the city
[1595.84 → 1596.74] 50 years ago,
[1597.40 → 1598.78] you would have seen
[1598.78 → 1599.94] a sign that would have said
[1599.94 → 1600.96] welcome to Smithfield,
[1601.06 → 1601.66] North Carolina,
[1601.78 → 1603.24] the home of the Ku Klux Klan.
[1606.02 → 1607.00] And there I was
[1607.00 → 1607.56] in Smithfield,
[1607.66 → 1608.28] North Carolina,
[1608.42 → 1608.94] hanging out with
[1608.94 → 1609.94] Dante and Shonda,
[1611.08 → 1611.88] a black couple
[1611.88 → 1613.30] that sold their home
[1613.30 → 1613.84] in Raleigh,
[1614.76 → 1615.68] 30 minutes north,
[1616.96 → 1617.96] bought an old church,
[1618.18 → 1618.90] a parsonage,
[1619.12 → 1620.02] and a daycare centre
[1620.02 → 1621.58] because God called them
[1621.58 → 1622.90] to go back to Smithfield
[1622.90 → 1624.38] and to plant the gospel.
[1626.66 → 1627.56] And I think of
[1627.56 → 1629.08] others like them
[1629.08 → 1630.64] who heard God's call,
[1631.84 → 1632.74] Christians who gave up
[1632.74 → 1633.32] their comfort,
[1634.22 → 1634.90] who went back
[1634.90 → 1636.00] to the forsaken places
[1636.00 → 1637.10] to plant the seeds
[1637.10 → 1637.72] of the gospel,
[1637.84 → 1638.48] to be the presence
[1638.48 → 1639.22] of Christ there.
[1639.52 → 1640.44] And I can't help
[1640.44 → 1640.88] but wonder,
[1640.90 → 1641.80] and I want to invite you
[1641.80 → 1642.68] to wonder with me,
[1644.18 → 1644.94] where might God
[1644.94 → 1645.74] be calling you
[1645.74 → 1648.14] to serve
[1648.14 → 1648.98] the good
[1648.98 → 1649.88] of this place,
[1650.56 → 1651.16] this city,
[1652.48 → 1653.40] these people?
[1654.86 → 1655.94] Even at the cost
[1655.94 → 1656.56] of your comfort,
[1656.56 → 1659.64] even at the cost
[1659.64 → 1660.42] of your well-being
[1660.42 → 1661.12] or your personal
[1661.12 → 1661.84] advantage.
[1663.50 → 1664.34] And what would happen
[1664.34 → 1665.20] if God's people
[1665.20 → 1666.24] in every congregation
[1666.24 → 1667.04] throughout Clayton
[1667.04 → 1668.36] and the greater Surrey
[1668.36 → 1668.90] community
[1668.90 → 1670.20] was animated
[1670.20 → 1672.02] by a shared vision
[1672.02 → 1673.22] to sacrifice
[1673.22 → 1674.08] for the good
[1674.08 → 1674.64] of the city
[1674.64 → 1675.38] and the good
[1675.38 → 1675.82] of the people
[1675.82 → 1676.50] who live here?
[1678.70 → 1679.62] This promise
[1679.62 → 1680.72] of a future home
[1680.72 → 1683.68] gives us good reasons
[1683.68 → 1684.82] to do things like that.
[1688.36 → 1689.12] But there's
[1689.12 → 1690.12] something else
[1690.12 → 1690.58] that's true
[1690.58 → 1691.58] about the Christian life
[1691.58 → 1693.20] and I want to close
[1693.20 → 1693.88] by talking about
[1693.88 → 1694.86] this dynamic.
[1696.10 → 1697.16] On the one hand,
[1698.12 → 1698.70] this longing
[1698.70 → 1699.56] for our future home
[1699.56 → 1700.58] gives us good reasons
[1700.58 → 1701.34] to be attached
[1701.34 → 1702.02] to this world,
[1702.20 → 1703.32] to work for it's good.
[1703.42 → 1704.30] On the other hand,
[1705.04 → 1706.38] we have some good reasons
[1706.38 → 1708.02] to practice
[1708.02 → 1708.94] healthy detachment
[1708.94 → 1709.34] as well.
[1709.38 → 1710.20] What do I mean by that?
[1710.20 → 1714.38] We've been spending
[1714.38 → 1715.08] a bit of time
[1715.08 → 1718.40] just acknowledging
[1718.40 → 1719.24] that the world
[1719.24 → 1720.18] that we live in today
[1720.18 → 1720.94] and the world
[1720.94 → 1722.10] of the last few years
[1722.10 → 1725.80] hasn't always felt
[1725.80 → 1727.96] like the home
[1727.96 → 1729.44] that our hearts
[1729.44 → 1730.24] really long for.
[1733.92 → 1735.00] We were made
[1735.00 → 1737.00] to live in a place
[1737.00 → 1738.60] without corruption,
[1739.20 → 1739.96] without injustice,
[1740.20 → 1741.76] without losing
[1741.76 → 1742.76] the people we love,
[1743.50 → 1744.44] without chaos
[1744.44 → 1745.08] and disease
[1745.08 → 1745.66] and division
[1745.66 → 1746.24] and conflict.
[1746.24 → 1746.80] We were made
[1746.80 → 1747.40] for a world
[1747.40 → 1747.96] like that.
[1750.14 → 1751.02] We were made
[1751.02 → 1752.24] to experience home.
[1754.50 → 1755.96] In unsettling times
[1755.96 → 1756.48] like the ones
[1756.48 → 1757.22] that we live in,
[1757.30 → 1758.68] we need to grow
[1758.68 → 1759.50] in our capacity
[1759.50 → 1760.20] to listen
[1760.20 → 1761.26] to those longings
[1761.26 → 1761.96] when they're stirred.
[1763.70 → 1764.22] You know,
[1764.24 → 1764.88] we're perfect
[1764.88 → 1765.48] at distractions,
[1765.60 → 1766.10] are we not?
[1768.50 → 1769.46] We start to feel
[1769.46 → 1769.86] restless,
[1770.08 → 1770.64] start to feel
[1770.64 → 1771.82] unsettled.
[1773.46 → 1774.22] It's really easy
[1774.22 → 1775.12] to go to the fridge
[1775.12 → 1776.16] and grab a beverage
[1776.16 → 1776.78] that will take
[1776.78 → 1777.48] the edge off,
[1779.56 → 1780.50] plop it down
[1780.50 → 1781.16] on the couch,
[1781.32 → 1781.90] binge something
[1781.90 → 1782.50] on Netflix.
[1782.50 → 1786.32] who wants to sit
[1786.32 → 1789.36] with a restless spirit
[1789.36 → 1792.66] and unsettling
[1792.66 → 1793.60] longings.
[1795.64 → 1796.60] And yet,
[1797.06 → 1798.72] I believe that
[1798.72 → 1801.08] in times like this,
[1801.64 → 1802.56] that's exactly
[1802.56 → 1803.34] God's invitation
[1803.34 → 1804.04] to us.
[1805.68 → 1806.84] To listen to
[1806.84 → 1807.44] what's stirring
[1807.44 → 1808.30] in our hearts.
[1808.30 → 1810.72] and not only
[1810.72 → 1811.44] to listen
[1811.44 → 1812.32] to our own hearts,
[1812.46 → 1813.80] but as the spirit
[1813.80 → 1814.30] of God
[1814.30 → 1815.12] would empower us
[1815.12 → 1815.86] to have the courage
[1815.86 → 1817.14] to wonder with others
[1817.14 → 1817.74] what's stirring
[1817.74 → 1818.52] in their hearts.
[1822.06 → 1822.58] You know,
[1822.60 → 1823.62] it's not just Christians
[1823.62 → 1825.38] who have to make sense
[1825.38 → 1826.02] of our world.
[1827.04 → 1827.92] We all do.
[1827.92 → 1833.16] So what would it look
[1833.16 → 1833.76] like for you
[1833.76 → 1834.34] to sit down
[1834.34 → 1835.02] with a non-Christian
[1835.02 → 1836.12] neighbour or friend,
[1837.40 → 1837.80] colleague,
[1838.06 → 1839.66] and wonder
[1839.66 → 1840.24] with them
[1840.24 → 1844.66] where their heart
[1844.66 → 1845.48] is unsettled?
[1848.38 → 1849.36] What longings
[1849.36 → 1850.00] are stirring
[1850.00 → 1851.32] in their spirit?
[1852.52 → 1853.76] What kind of home
[1853.76 → 1854.96] do they long for?
[1854.96 → 1858.48] Is there any hope
[1858.48 → 1859.40] for that kind of home
[1859.40 → 1860.02] in this world
[1860.02 → 1861.24] as we experience it today?
[1863.98 → 1864.86] These are perfect
[1864.86 → 1865.82] questions to sit with.
[1867.66 → 1868.64] There was a Christian
[1868.64 → 1869.18] author,
[1870.28 → 1870.88] C.S. Lewis,
[1871.28 → 1873.12] who thought deeply
[1873.12 → 1874.18] about human longing
[1874.18 → 1874.88] and desire.
[1876.44 → 1877.24] And he writes
[1877.24 → 1878.94] about the longings
[1878.94 → 1879.86] that arise
[1879.86 → 1880.86] in the human spirit
[1880.86 → 1883.00] when we fall in love.
[1884.96 → 1885.80] When we think about
[1885.80 → 1886.82] going on a vacation
[1886.82 → 1888.14] to an exotic place.
[1888.84 → 1889.98] When we get excited
[1889.98 → 1890.62] about learning
[1890.62 → 1891.38] something new
[1891.38 → 1892.58] and get captured
[1892.58 → 1893.48] by knowledge.
[1894.80 → 1895.66] And he writes
[1895.66 → 1896.52] that even in the case
[1896.52 → 1897.46] of the best marriages,
[1897.76 → 1899.20] the best possible vacation,
[1900.16 → 1901.36] the most learning
[1901.36 → 1902.10] and education
[1902.10 → 1902.78] you can get,
[1902.96 → 1904.84] the most wonderful career
[1904.84 → 1906.04] you could fill in the list,
[1907.08 → 1908.10] that there's still
[1908.10 → 1909.14] some ache
[1909.14 → 1910.14] in the human spirit
[1910.14 → 1911.64] for something more.
[1911.64 → 1915.44] So what do we do?
[1919.22 → 1920.22] Lewis was also
[1920.22 → 1921.46] a very logical thinker.
[1922.86 → 1923.66] He always liked
[1923.66 → 1924.50] to give us our options.
[1924.60 → 1924.94] So he said,
[1925.02 → 1926.04] we kind of have three options
[1926.04 → 1927.16] when this happens to us.
[1927.94 → 1928.56] Number one,
[1929.72 → 1931.66] we can blame the stuff.
[1934.48 → 1935.22] In other words,
[1935.28 → 1935.80] we could say,
[1935.88 → 1936.10] you know,
[1936.20 → 1936.98] the reason that you're
[1936.98 → 1937.62] not satisfied
[1937.62 → 1938.22] in your marriage
[1938.22 → 1938.72] is you don't have
[1938.72 → 1939.44] a very good marriage.
[1939.54 → 1940.44] Go find a different partner.
[1941.64 → 1942.50] The reason that
[1942.50 → 1943.42] you get home
[1943.42 → 1944.14] from that vacation
[1944.14 → 1944.72] and there's just
[1944.72 → 1945.42] something missing
[1945.42 → 1946.58] is it wasn't a great one.
[1946.84 → 1947.30] Next time,
[1947.38 → 1948.40] go see a travel agent.
[1948.54 → 1949.46] Take a better vacation.
[1951.14 → 1952.34] Find a better career.
[1953.34 → 1954.50] Get a better house.
[1954.50 → 1956.52] In other words,
[1957.04 → 1958.32] one option is
[1958.32 → 1959.92] it's the stuff's problem.
[1960.76 → 1962.18] The stuff doesn't satisfy.
[1962.34 → 1963.22] Get better stuff.
[1965.22 → 1966.46] Sound familiar?
[1966.46 → 1970.36] Option two is
[1970.36 → 1971.98] it's your desires
[1971.98 → 1972.72] the problem.
[1974.56 → 1975.44] Like, just lower
[1975.44 → 1976.30] the expectations.
[1978.34 → 1978.96] I don't think
[1978.96 → 1979.64] they had this saying
[1979.64 → 1980.40] in Lewis' day,
[1980.50 → 1980.84] but you know,
[1980.90 → 1981.46] you hear it today,
[1981.58 → 1982.48] it is what it is.
[1982.64 → 1984.42] Like, just deal with it.
[1984.92 → 1986.32] You're expecting too much.
[1987.00 → 1988.30] You're chasing the stars.
[1988.84 → 1989.76] You have longings
[1989.76 → 1990.42] that are never
[1990.42 → 1991.10] going to get met.
[1991.10 → 1993.88] So just lower
[1993.88 → 1994.88] your expectations.
[1996.28 → 1996.64] He says,
[1996.78 → 1997.08] or,
[1997.46 → 1998.84] there's always
[1998.84 → 1999.48] a third way
[1999.48 → 2000.06] we see us lose,
[2000.18 → 2000.64] or there's
[2000.64 → 2001.46] the Christian way.
[2002.60 → 2003.74] What's the Christian way?
[2003.80 → 2004.60] This is what he puts.
[2005.10 → 2006.88] The Christian reasons
[2006.88 → 2007.56] that creatures
[2007.56 → 2008.48] are not born
[2008.48 → 2009.44] with desires
[2009.44 → 2011.54] unless satisfaction
[2011.54 → 2012.82] for those desires
[2012.82 → 2013.48] exists.
[2014.60 → 2016.10] A baby feels hunger.
[2016.62 → 2017.06] Well, there's
[2017.06 → 2017.86] such a thing as food.
[2018.84 → 2019.48] A duckling
[2019.48 → 2020.36] wants to swim.
[2020.36 → 2020.74] Well, there's
[2020.74 → 2021.62] such a thing as water.
[2022.74 → 2024.10] Men feel sexual desire.
[2024.26 → 2024.58] Well, there's
[2024.58 → 2025.64] such a thing as sex.
[2026.60 → 2028.12] If I find in myself
[2028.12 → 2028.84] a desire
[2028.84 → 2030.64] which no experience
[2030.64 → 2031.22] in this world
[2031.22 → 2032.14] can satisfy,
[2032.50 → 2033.52] the most probable
[2033.52 → 2034.24] explanation
[2034.24 → 2035.54] is I was made
[2035.54 → 2036.42] for another world.
[2040.68 → 2041.64] You see what Lewis
[2041.64 → 2042.40] is getting after?
[2043.48 → 2044.26] Is that we can
[2044.26 → 2045.50] take the pressure off
[2045.50 → 2048.04] the things in our lives
[2048.04 → 2048.78] that we try to put
[2048.78 → 2049.74] too much weight on
[2049.74 → 2052.62] think of a bridge.
[2054.26 → 2055.74] A bridge is designed
[2055.74 → 2056.52] to bear only
[2056.52 → 2057.26] so much weight.
[2058.56 → 2059.60] If you drive
[2059.60 → 2060.40] over a bridge
[2060.40 → 2061.30] carrying more weight
[2061.30 → 2061.86] than the bridge
[2061.86 → 2062.36] can bear,
[2062.56 → 2063.88] the bridge will crack.
[2064.00 → 2064.34] Eventually,
[2064.48 → 2065.40] the bridge will fail.
[2066.40 → 2067.36] It's not able
[2067.36 → 2068.16] to bear the weight
[2068.16 → 2068.90] you put on it.
[2072.30 → 2072.74] Friends,
[2072.82 → 2073.66] it can be the same way
[2073.66 → 2074.36] in our lives.
[2074.36 → 2077.92] It can be the same way
[2077.92 → 2079.42] in our lives.
[2080.64 → 2081.98] We can look to our spouses.
[2083.30 → 2084.66] We can look to our children.
[2085.88 → 2087.20] We can look to our work,
[2088.20 → 2089.86] our holidays,
[2090.78 → 2091.64] our bucket list.
[2092.98 → 2094.26] And we can believe
[2094.26 → 2097.28] that these things,
[2097.70 → 2099.06] if we do them the right way,
[2099.06 → 2101.48] they will satisfy us.
[2103.72 → 2104.64] But if we start
[2104.64 → 2105.36] to believe that
[2105.36 → 2105.72] and we start
[2105.72 → 2106.52] to live that out,
[2106.58 → 2107.38] we're putting way
[2107.38 → 2108.28] too much pressure
[2108.28 → 2109.20] on those things.
[2109.74 → 2111.72] And they will crack.
[2112.84 → 2113.98] They cannot bear
[2113.98 → 2114.50] the weight
[2114.50 → 2116.02] of our deepest
[2116.02 → 2117.02] human longings.
[2118.18 → 2118.94] You can have
[2118.94 → 2119.92] the perfect spouse
[2119.92 → 2122.24] and still ache
[2122.24 → 2123.86] and be hungry
[2123.86 → 2124.44] for love.
[2125.34 → 2125.98] You can have
[2125.98 → 2126.94] the perfect career
[2126.94 → 2127.94] and still long
[2127.94 → 2128.92] for something more.
[2129.68 → 2130.26] You can have had
[2130.26 → 2131.74] the most amazing holiday
[2131.74 → 2134.62] and on the way home
[2134.62 → 2135.92] have this aching feeling
[2135.92 → 2136.46] inside
[2136.46 → 2137.66] that something
[2137.66 → 2139.46] was missing.
[2142.90 → 2143.80] In fact,
[2144.34 → 2146.18] I wonder
[2146.18 → 2146.82] if often
[2146.82 → 2147.82] our complaints
[2147.82 → 2152.66] haven't we learned
[2152.66 → 2153.16] to complain
[2153.16 → 2153.64] a lot more
[2153.64 → 2154.34] lately as well?
[2155.62 → 2156.74] That's another sermon.
[2156.94 → 2157.30] perhaps.
[2158.50 → 2159.30] But I wonder
[2159.30 → 2160.32] if our complaints
[2160.32 → 2161.28] about the world,
[2162.58 → 2163.22] about people,
[2164.58 → 2165.38] about the quality
[2165.38 → 2165.90] or speed
[2165.90 → 2167.26] of customer service,
[2168.02 → 2169.00] about circumstances,
[2170.56 → 2170.84] I wonder
[2170.84 → 2171.94] if some of our complaints
[2171.94 → 2173.28] don't actually arise
[2173.28 → 2174.40] out of this human tendency
[2174.40 → 2175.14] to expect
[2175.14 → 2176.50] too much of things,
[2177.06 → 2178.86] more than they are
[2178.86 → 2179.64] able to bear,
[2180.84 → 2181.72] under the weight
[2181.72 → 2182.12] of which,
[2182.26 → 2183.06] like this bridge,
[2183.18 → 2183.68] they crack.
[2183.68 → 2189.70] friends,
[2189.74 → 2190.54] when we recognize
[2190.54 → 2192.00] that there are
[2192.00 → 2193.24] longings and desires
[2193.24 → 2195.44] that rise up
[2195.44 → 2196.52] in times like this
[2196.52 → 2198.60] that are unfulfillable
[2198.60 → 2200.62] in this life,
[2201.24 → 2204.28] that they're like
[2204.28 → 2205.12] a memory trace
[2205.12 → 2205.66] pointing us
[2205.66 → 2206.76] to our future home,
[2207.32 → 2208.52] we can take the pressure
[2208.52 → 2209.22] off these things,
[2209.32 → 2210.12] we can detach
[2210.12 → 2211.00] our hearts
[2211.00 → 2211.84] in a healthy way
[2211.84 → 2212.36] from finding
[2212.36 → 2212.88] our ultimate
[2212.88 → 2213.68] satisfaction
[2213.68 → 2214.48] in them
[2214.48 → 2214.88] because they were
[2214.88 → 2215.38] never,
[2215.44 → 2216.40] ever intended
[2216.40 → 2217.26] to deliver that.
[2221.22 → 2221.96] Now someone
[2221.96 → 2222.80] in the morning service
[2222.80 → 2223.28] grabbed me
[2223.28 → 2224.02] after this message
[2224.02 → 2224.44] and started
[2224.44 → 2225.08] to feel guilty
[2225.08 → 2225.80] about the vacation
[2225.80 → 2226.30] they were taking
[2226.30 → 2226.76] this week.
[2226.76 → 2229.26] that's not what
[2229.26 → 2229.72] I'm saying.
[2230.30 → 2231.30] Enjoy the vacation.
[2232.72 → 2233.72] Have a great time.
[2234.48 → 2235.46] But it cannot
[2235.46 → 2236.86] bear the weight
[2236.86 → 2237.98] of the deepest
[2237.98 → 2238.70] longings of your
[2238.70 → 2239.48] heart that it will
[2239.48 → 2239.76] stir.
[2244.32 → 2245.38] And you can steer
[2245.38 → 2246.36] your heart clear
[2246.36 → 2247.70] from all the false
[2247.70 → 2248.34] homecomings
[2248.34 → 2250.00] where we put the
[2250.00 → 2250.48] weight of our
[2250.48 → 2251.40] desires on things
[2251.40 → 2252.20] that can't bear
[2252.20 → 2252.74] the weight.
[2253.60 → 2254.46] And we can also
[2254.46 → 2255.22] find the courage
[2255.22 → 2255.82] as we attend
[2255.82 → 2256.48] to our own
[2256.48 → 2257.00] hearts
[2257.00 → 2259.38] to invite others
[2259.38 → 2260.00] to experience
[2260.00 → 2261.22] the only homecoming
[2261.22 → 2261.82] that will truly
[2261.82 → 2263.36] satisfy the deepest
[2263.36 → 2264.42] longings and desires
[2264.42 → 2265.36] of the human spirit.
[2266.70 → 2266.96] And friends,
[2267.02 → 2267.98] this is the hope
[2267.98 → 2268.56] that we find
[2268.56 → 2269.56] in the biblical story
[2269.56 → 2270.78] in this glorious
[2270.78 → 2272.20] image of where
[2272.20 → 2273.14] the story ends.
[2274.88 → 2275.66] Something that's
[2275.66 → 2276.36] only possible
[2276.36 → 2276.98] because of the
[2276.98 → 2278.04] death and resurrection
[2278.04 → 2279.00] of Jesus Christ.
[2280.68 → 2281.58] God has made
[2281.58 → 2282.04] a way
[2282.04 → 2284.72] to put an end
[2284.72 → 2286.18] to our exile
[2286.18 → 2286.80] from home.
[2288.04 → 2288.82] When Jesus
[2288.82 → 2289.62] rose from that
[2289.62 → 2290.06] grave,
[2290.80 → 2291.88] he broke the
[2291.88 → 2292.84] power of death,
[2293.36 → 2294.24] he broke the
[2294.24 → 2294.66] curse,
[2295.02 → 2295.68] and he opened
[2295.68 → 2296.36] the way for us
[2296.36 → 2297.08] to find home
[2297.08 → 2297.66] again in the
[2297.66 → 2298.54] resurrection life
[2298.54 → 2299.22] that's to come.
[2300.04 → 2300.38] In fact,
[2300.44 → 2301.32] God promised that
[2301.32 → 2302.42] one day his son
[2302.42 → 2303.10] would return,
[2303.78 → 2304.38] and it would be
[2304.38 → 2304.78] so.
[2305.34 → 2306.00] He would return
[2306.00 → 2306.96] to this world
[2306.96 → 2308.06] and remake it
[2308.06 → 2308.92] and reconcile
[2308.92 → 2309.70] all things
[2309.70 → 2310.40] and heal all
[2310.40 → 2310.88] our hurts
[2310.88 → 2311.64] and pick up
[2311.64 → 2312.24] all the broken,
[2312.44 → 2313.06] scattered pieces
[2313.06 → 2313.78] of our lives
[2313.78 → 2314.44] and of this world
[2314.44 → 2315.18] and mend them
[2315.18 → 2315.60] together
[2315.60 → 2316.34] and breathe
[2316.34 → 2316.96] new life
[2316.96 → 2317.72] into them again.
[2320.94 → 2321.70] We will be
[2321.70 → 2322.30] at peace.
[2323.40 → 2324.58] We will belong.
[2325.48 → 2326.64] We will be safe
[2326.64 → 2327.26] and secure.
[2328.92 → 2330.02] We will be freed
[2330.02 → 2330.72] of shame
[2330.72 → 2331.38] and guilt,
[2332.00 → 2332.58] delighted in
[2332.58 → 2333.02] by our Heavenly
[2333.02 → 2333.48] Father,
[2333.64 → 2334.76] the one who will
[2334.76 → 2335.44] stoop down
[2335.44 → 2336.48] and wipe every tear
[2336.48 → 2337.38] from our eyes.
[2337.38 → 2340.06] the one who declares
[2340.06 → 2340.98] to us again
[2340.98 → 2341.54] this morning,
[2342.40 → 2343.04] I am making
[2343.04 → 2344.66] all things new.
[2345.78 → 2346.58] Praise God
[2346.58 → 2347.32] for such grace.
[2347.40 → 2347.80] Let's pray.
[2350.12 → 2350.60] Father,
[2350.68 → 2351.26] we thank you
[2351.26 → 2352.62] for your word
[2352.62 → 2353.20] this morning.
[2354.08 → 2354.82] We thank you
[2354.82 → 2355.52] for this glorious
[2355.52 → 2356.24] invitation
[2356.24 → 2357.50] to attend
[2357.50 → 2358.38] to our desires
[2358.38 → 2359.12] and longings
[2359.12 → 2359.66] for home.
[2360.74 → 2361.66] And we thank you
[2361.66 → 2362.46] that one day
[2362.46 → 2363.26] that future
[2363.26 → 2364.06] final home
[2364.06 → 2364.86] will be ours.
[2365.02 → 2365.52] Heaven and earth
[2365.52 → 2366.20] will be one.
[2366.20 → 2370.04] God,
[2370.16 → 2370.76] save us
[2370.76 → 2371.36] from putting
[2371.36 → 2373.32] our hope
[2373.32 → 2374.52] on people
[2374.52 → 2375.32] and circumstances
[2375.32 → 2376.04] on things
[2376.04 → 2376.78] that cannot bear
[2376.78 → 2377.16] the weight
[2377.16 → 2377.60] of our deep
[2377.60 → 2378.06] longings
[2378.06 → 2378.62] to be home.
[2381.06 → 2381.80] And give us
[2381.80 → 2382.40] the courage
[2382.40 → 2383.16] and capacity
[2383.16 → 2383.68] of God's
[2383.68 → 2384.42] spirit power
[2384.42 → 2387.76] to wonder
[2387.76 → 2390.46] with the people
[2390.46 → 2390.82] that you've
[2390.82 → 2391.76] put in our lives
[2391.76 → 2395.08] to sit
[2395.08 → 2395.52] not only
[2395.52 → 2396.02] with our own
[2396.02 → 2396.48] longings
[2396.48 → 2397.00] but to sit
[2397.00 → 2397.36] with their
[2397.36 → 2397.96] longings
[2397.96 → 2400.04] their desires
[2400.04 → 2401.80] and God
[2401.80 → 2402.18] would you be
[2402.18 → 2402.64] pleased
[2402.64 → 2402.98] by your
[2402.98 → 2403.54] Holy Spirit
[2403.54 → 2404.00] to use
[2404.00 → 2404.60] people like
[2404.60 → 2405.02] us
[2405.02 → 2406.44] so that other
[2406.44 → 2406.96] people might
[2406.96 → 2407.54] find their way
[2407.54 → 2408.06] back home
[2408.06 → 2408.48] to you.
[2410.04 → 2410.84] We pray this
[2410.84 → 2411.58] in Christ's name.
[2412.34 → 2412.60] Amen.
[2412.60 → 2412.70] Amen.
[2412.70 → 2422.58] So this morning
[2422.58 → 2423.30] we get to come
[2423.30 → 2424.02] to the Lord's
[2424.02 → 2424.30] table.
[2426.66 → 2427.90] It's my privilege
[2427.90 → 2428.44] to lead us
[2428.44 → 2429.18] in this as well
[2429.18 → 2432.02] and I want
[2432.02 → 2432.46] to do this
[2432.46 → 2432.84] in a way
[2432.84 → 2433.36] this morning
[2433.36 → 2435.08] that just
[2435.08 → 2435.72] continues to
[2435.72 → 2436.22] invite us
[2436.22 → 2436.96] to lean in
[2436.96 → 2437.88] to what we've
[2437.88 → 2438.28] been talking
[2438.28 → 2438.76] about this
[2438.76 → 2439.02] morning.
[2439.02 → 2442.42] There's an
[2442.42 → 2442.98] account of
[2442.98 → 2443.36] the Last
[2443.36 → 2443.68] Supper
[2443.68 → 2444.86] that's told
[2444.86 → 2445.52] in the Gospel
[2445.52 → 2446.06] of Luke
[2446.06 → 2448.40] and in that
[2448.40 → 2448.82] account
[2448.82 → 2450.32] we find that
[2450.32 → 2451.30] Jesus invites
[2451.30 → 2451.82] us to take
[2451.82 → 2452.30] the bread
[2452.30 → 2452.88] and to take
[2452.88 → 2453.36] the cup
[2453.36 → 2456.42] and to think
[2456.42 → 2456.82] about two
[2456.82 → 2457.28] things
[2457.28 → 2459.84] as it were
[2459.84 → 2460.26] at the same
[2460.26 → 2460.66] time.
[2462.34 → 2463.04] To take
[2463.04 → 2464.42] the bread
[2464.42 → 2465.08] and the cup
[2465.08 → 2466.22] as tangible
[2466.22 → 2467.08] signs of his
[2467.08 → 2467.88] body and his
[2467.88 → 2468.22] blood
[2468.22 → 2470.06] that he
[2470.06 → 2470.46] would pour
[2470.46 → 2471.32] out for us
[2471.32 → 2472.48] on the cross.
[2475.80 → 2476.50] And so he
[2476.50 → 2477.12] took the bread
[2477.12 → 2479.22] and he said
[2479.22 → 2479.76] to his friends
[2479.76 → 2480.52] he says to us
[2480.52 → 2480.98] this morning
[2480.98 → 2482.20] this is my
[2482.20 → 2483.14] body which is
[2483.14 → 2483.84] given for you
[2483.84 → 2486.30] and he took
[2486.30 → 2486.78] the cup
[2486.78 → 2489.56] he said
[2489.56 → 2490.14] this cup
[2490.14 → 2490.98] is the new
[2490.98 → 2491.80] covenant in my
[2491.80 → 2492.46] blood that's
[2492.46 → 2492.92] poured out
[2492.92 → 2493.36] for you.
[2496.54 → 2497.20] And he was
[2497.20 → 2497.86] thinking of going
[2497.86 → 2498.60] to the cross.
[2501.94 → 2502.60] God would
[2502.60 → 2503.18] stop short of
[2503.18 → 2503.68] nothing to
[2503.68 → 2504.24] rescue this
[2504.24 → 2504.54] world.
[2505.66 → 2506.10] Give up his
[2506.10 → 2506.58] own son.
[2508.06 → 2508.58] But Jesus
[2508.58 → 2510.88] also invites
[2510.88 → 2511.70] us to look
[2511.70 → 2512.94] even further
[2512.94 → 2515.18] down the
[2515.18 → 2515.54] future.
[2517.38 → 2517.98] Because he
[2517.98 → 2518.72] also said this
[2518.72 → 2519.16] at that meal
[2519.16 → 2519.88] I will not
[2519.88 → 2520.64] eat again
[2520.64 → 2522.06] this meal
[2522.06 → 2522.86] until it
[2522.86 → 2523.70] finds fulfillment
[2523.70 → 2524.26] in the kingdom
[2524.26 → 2524.78] of God.
[2526.30 → 2526.98] And I will
[2526.98 → 2527.58] not drink
[2527.58 → 2528.14] again of the
[2528.14 → 2528.62] fruit of the
[2528.62 → 2529.38] vine until the
[2529.38 → 2529.90] kingdom of
[2529.90 → 2530.78] God comes.
[2533.68 → 2534.44] And so as
[2534.44 → 2535.10] those who
[2535.10 → 2536.22] stand as we
[2536.22 → 2536.60] do on the
[2536.60 → 2537.28] other side of
[2537.28 → 2538.12] the cross and
[2538.12 → 2538.46] the empty
[2538.46 → 2539.12] tomb we look
[2539.12 → 2541.76] back and our
[2541.76 → 2542.18] hearts are filled
[2542.18 → 2542.76] with gratitude
[2542.76 → 2543.44] this morning that
[2543.44 → 2544.12] God would stop
[2544.12 → 2544.78] short of nothing
[2544.78 → 2545.60] to rescue this
[2545.60 → 2545.80] world.
[2545.92 → 2546.60] He gave up his
[2546.60 → 2546.88] son.
[2548.22 → 2548.76] We take the
[2548.76 → 2549.40] body and the
[2549.40 → 2549.98] blood of Jesus
[2549.98 → 2551.06] to nourish us.
[2551.06 → 2553.00] But we also
[2553.00 → 2553.66] look ahead
[2553.66 → 2556.84] to that day
[2556.84 → 2557.50] that's coming
[2557.50 → 2559.80] where there
[2559.80 → 2560.58] will be
[2560.58 → 2561.86] another image
[2561.86 → 2562.48] in this beautiful
[2562.48 → 2562.86] book of
[2562.86 → 2563.46] Revelation a
[2563.46 → 2564.22] great feast.
[2566.30 → 2566.60] The people
[2566.60 → 2567.20] gather from
[2567.20 → 2567.88] every tribe,
[2568.04 → 2568.34] language,
[2568.52 → 2568.94] people and
[2568.94 → 2569.22] nation.
[2569.34 → 2569.74] The wedding
[2569.74 → 2570.50] supper of the
[2570.50 → 2570.82] Lamb.
[2571.14 → 2571.64] The final
[2571.64 → 2572.44] fulfillment of
[2572.44 → 2572.80] the kingdom
[2572.80 → 2573.48] of God when
[2573.48 → 2573.94] heaven and
[2573.94 → 2574.68] earth are one
[2574.68 → 2575.64] and all is
[2575.64 → 2576.20] made new.
[2579.02 → 2579.42] And so
[2579.42 → 2581.20] as you're
[2581.20 → 2581.70] ready I
[2581.70 → 2582.12] invite you to
[2582.12 → 2582.66] come forward.
[2582.80 → 2583.28] There's four
[2583.28 → 2583.80] stations.
[2585.24 → 2585.74] As you take
[2585.74 → 2586.24] the bread,
[2587.78 → 2588.38] as you raise
[2588.38 → 2589.06] the cup this
[2589.06 → 2589.38] morning,
[2590.24 → 2590.80] would you do
[2590.80 → 2592.32] that not only
[2592.32 → 2593.04] with gratitude
[2593.04 → 2593.74] in your heart
[2593.74 → 2594.54] for what Christ
[2594.54 → 2595.32] has done to
[2595.32 → 2595.88] rescue this
[2595.88 → 2596.76] world in you
[2596.76 → 2597.88] but would you
[2597.88 → 2598.36] do that in
[2598.36 → 2599.32] anticipation of
[2599.32 → 2599.78] that future
[2599.78 → 2601.80] day when
[2601.80 → 2602.80] every deepest
[2602.80 → 2603.44] longing of your
[2603.44 → 2604.32] heart is finally
[2604.32 → 2606.80] met and we
[2606.80 → 2607.48] enjoy the most
[2607.48 → 2608.48] lavish feast the
[2608.48 → 2608.96] world has ever
[2608.96 → 2609.26] seen.
[2609.42 → 2611.46] So eat and
[2611.46 → 2611.82] drink.
[2612.58 → 2612.98] Remember,
[2613.46 → 2613.84] believe.
