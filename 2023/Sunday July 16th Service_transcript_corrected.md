[0.00 → 1.10] Thank you for your prayer.
[2.20 → 3.76] A bit of a long way around.
[4.64 → 6.72] For our summer camp, we've moved the stairs,
[7.06 → 9.14] and it's been a great week from what I heard,
[9.36 → 10.54] from what I've seen as well.
[11.94 → 15.78] Also, our family just got back from our church camp yesterday.
[16.18 → 18.40] They are probably packed up and getting ready
[18.40 → 21.20] to get out of the campsite right now as we speak.
[21.82 → 24.12] It was a great time of fellowship and prayer.
[25.40 → 26.22] Fellowship and prayer.
[26.22 → 27.04] We did pray.
[27.92 → 30.40] Fellowship and lots of camping, lots of woods.
[31.94 → 37.40] I know that Val is leading the little worship service there together,
[37.62 → 40.30] and what they're doing, what she's planning to do,
[40.72 → 43.56] was to memorize the Beatitudes, all the Beatitudes.
[44.16 → 45.62] So if we can try that now to get...
[45.62 → 46.16] No, I'm just kidding.
[46.40 → 47.50] We're not going to do that here.
[48.22 → 50.30] We're going to read it together
[50.30 → 52.80] because we've been going through the Beatitudes.
[52.98 → 55.06] It's going to be on the screen for you.
[55.06 → 59.02] The only thing is, it'll be a little bit hard to follow.
[59.12 → 63.28] I'm going to include the paraphrases that will hopefully spark the memory
[63.28 → 65.98] of what's been preached about each Beatitude.
[66.52 → 68.90] And so hear the word of the Lord for us this morning.
[69.18 → 71.90] We read from Matthew 5, verse 1.
[71.90 → 75.20] Now, when Jesus saw the crowds,
[75.50 → 77.72] he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
[78.16 → 81.02] His disciples came to him, and he began to teach them.
[81.54 → 81.98] He said,
[82.68 → 84.90] Blessed are the poor in spirit,
[85.34 → 88.14] which means who are in utter dependence on God,
[88.44 → 89.92] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[90.82 → 92.18] Blessed are those who mourn,
[92.54 → 94.98] who share God's heart for sin and brokenness,
[95.06 → 96.26] for they will be comforted.
[97.48 → 98.48] Blessed are the meek,
[98.48 → 101.72] who find their strength only in God,
[101.94 → 103.24] for they shall inherit the earth.
[103.96 → 106.74] Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[107.30 → 111.06] who share that craving  restoration that God promises,
[111.46 → 113.60] for they, and only they will be satisfied.
[114.72 → 117.20] Blessed are the merciful that we looked at last week,
[117.38 → 119.82] who know that all fall short,
[120.12 → 121.58] and that we all need doctors,
[122.02 → 123.88] for they will also be shown mercy.
[123.88 → 125.42] And this morning,
[126.26 → 127.74] blessed are the pure in heart,
[128.08 → 131.76] who are purely honest about all of our shortcomings,
[132.04 → 132.82] and our needs,
[132.96 → 134.66] and our dependence on God,
[135.34 → 137.86] for you will see God.
[138.88 → 139.26] Amen.
[140.00 → 141.20] You will see God.
[142.56 → 145.36] These are descriptions of what a Christian looks like.
[146.22 → 149.38] And it paints a picture of someone broken and humble,
[149.68 → 151.86] and know that they are broken and humble.
[151.86 → 154.66] And it's not some sort of angelic figure
[154.66 → 156.68] in the clouds with a halo or something.
[157.58 → 159.22] And specifically for us this morning,
[159.28 → 160.24] as we hear the words,
[160.60 → 161.28] pure in heart,
[162.28 → 163.54] try to be honest with yourself.
[163.92 → 166.24] What are the first images that come to your mind
[166.24 → 167.60] when you hear pure in heart?
[168.42 → 169.40] Like, put it in context.
[169.66 → 171.14] In our Christian faith,
[171.48 → 172.48] in our journeys of faith,
[172.54 → 174.62] when you hear these biblical passages
[174.62 → 176.64] from Jesus himself saying,
[176.90 → 178.50] blessed are the pure in heart,
[179.38 → 181.52] what are the first things that come to your mind?
[181.86 → 185.68] In a dialogue between a couple of monks,
[185.78 → 187.46] that same question was asked.
[188.62 → 191.20] A St. Francis, a monk in the 13th century,
[191.54 → 193.46] was asking one of his disciples, his brothers,
[194.08 → 196.18] Leo, do you know what it means to be pure in heart?
[196.88 → 199.72] And then his answer rings kind of true
[199.72 → 202.44] to how I grew up thinking pure in heart meant.
[203.28 → 205.38] The answer from this person named Leo was,
[205.38 → 207.32] yes, I know what it means.
[207.72 → 210.20] To be pure in heart means to be without sin,
[210.70 → 211.44] no faults,
[211.68 → 213.98] and no weaknesses to reproach myself for.
[214.80 → 215.90] That was his definition,
[216.30 → 217.98] his thought of what pure in heart meant.
[218.22 → 220.42] And that's why he was so distraught and depressed.
[221.18 → 221.78] He says,
[222.06 → 224.00] like, I wish I never even read that passage.
[225.02 → 225.64] Pure in heart.
[226.32 → 227.42] I'm not pure yet.
[227.80 → 228.62] I'm not pure enough.
[229.42 → 230.36] That was his thinking.
[231.36 → 232.02] Like, my wife,
[232.08 → 233.12] when I was reading this
[233.12 → 234.18] and going through my sermon,
[234.30 → 235.02] my wife was saying,
[235.38 → 235.78] for me,
[235.86 → 236.82] when I hear pure in heart,
[236.96 → 238.02] I actually think of, like,
[238.08 → 238.40] more,
[238.72 → 239.28] because we're,
[239.88 → 241.72] Korea's heritage
[241.72 → 243.22] is a Buddhist heritage.
[243.76 → 245.56] And I don't know if you've seen
[245.56 → 246.24] Kung Fu Panda.
[246.46 → 247.42] That's the movie she referenced.
[247.80 → 248.18] She's like,
[248.36 → 249.58] I picture that little master.
[249.72 → 250.50] I think he's a rat.
[250.98 → 251.54] And he's, like,
[251.60 → 252.72] talking to his student,
[252.82 → 253.86] like, the panda.
[254.30 → 254.84] He's saying,
[255.16 → 255.32] like,
[255.32 → 256.68] empty your mind, my student.
[257.18 → 258.70] That's to be pure and clean
[258.70 → 259.52] in your mind.
[260.24 → 261.36] And that's the kind of image
[261.36 → 262.06] she thought of.
[263.40 → 265.22] Now, whatever image
[265.22 → 266.48] comes to mind for you,
[267.96 → 268.92] this answer
[268.92 → 271.20] of being pure enough,
[271.62 → 272.82] am I clean enough?
[273.08 → 274.20] Am I without sin?
[275.02 → 275.58] Sometimes,
[276.02 → 277.36] just like the Pharisees
[277.36 → 278.98] and the devout religious people
[278.98 → 279.80] of Jesus' day,
[280.16 → 281.48] we misinterpret,
[281.78 → 283.80] we mistake these beatitudes,
[283.80 → 285.24] including pure of heart,
[285.24 → 287.86] to be prerequisites
[287.86 → 289.98] as some sort of moral standards
[289.98 → 291.48] to be good enough
[291.48 → 292.94] to receive God's blessing.
[293.44 → 295.22] And that's the upside-down
[295.22 → 296.66] misinterpretation
[296.66 → 297.62] that we looked at before.
[298.70 → 299.84] To be pure in heart
[299.84 → 301.04] and all the qualities
[301.04 → 302.52] of these beatitude people
[302.52 → 303.94] to be kingdom people,
[304.30 → 305.54] these are descriptions
[305.54 → 307.34] and these are fruits
[307.34 → 309.44] that are grown
[309.44 → 311.24] out of God's Holy Spirit
[311.24 → 312.70] when we are confronted
[312.70 → 314.18] and transformed
[314.18 → 315.90] by the gospel message
[315.90 → 316.80] of Jesus Christ.
[318.04 → 319.60] It allows us
[319.60 → 320.62] to become
[320.62 → 321.68] and bear fruits
[321.68 → 322.90] of kingdom people.
[323.40 → 324.82] And these are descriptions,
[325.08 → 325.62] as I've said.
[327.06 → 329.10] Because of God's work,
[329.22 → 330.08] not our work,
[330.66 → 332.04] God's work on the cross
[332.04 → 333.12] and now through His Spirit,
[333.44 → 334.44] we bear fruits
[334.44 → 335.18] of kingdom living.
[335.56 → 336.88] And so here's the bottom line
[336.88 → 337.74] for the gospel.
[337.74 → 339.42] The good news for us
[339.42 → 339.96] this morning,
[340.66 → 341.56] this blessing,
[341.56 → 342.90] the blessing for those
[342.90 → 344.22] who are pure in heart
[344.22 → 345.68] refers to those
[345.68 → 347.14] who are totally,
[347.54 → 348.96] entirely honest
[348.96 → 350.12] before God
[350.12 → 351.54] of how broken
[351.54 → 352.28] we all are.
[353.16 → 354.48] Not cleansing
[354.48 → 356.28] and being clean enough
[356.28 → 357.72] that God will bless us.
[358.24 → 359.40] The fruit of blessing
[359.40 → 360.74] is realizing,
[361.04 → 361.62] acknowledging,
[361.94 → 363.34] and coming to God
[363.34 → 364.40] in full honesty
[364.40 → 365.98] of how broken
[365.98 → 366.80] we all are.
[367.80 → 368.84] Sounds very much
[368.84 → 369.50] like the message
[369.50 → 370.40] that Pastor Sid
[370.40 → 371.08] preached for us
[371.08 → 371.64] last week.
[371.84 → 373.14] That we are all sinners.
[373.52 → 375.16] We all need doctors.
[375.54 → 376.36] We all need mercy.
[377.52 → 378.18] To fully
[378.18 → 379.74] and purely
[379.74 → 381.50] know double-mindedness
[381.50 → 382.46] like James says
[382.46 → 383.00] in his letter.
[383.66 → 384.22] Purely
[384.22 → 385.64] know
[385.64 → 386.80] that we are
[386.80 → 387.40] broken.
[387.78 → 388.56] That we are utterly
[388.56 → 389.50] dependent on God.
[389.64 → 390.60] That we mourn
[390.60 → 391.24] with God
[391.24 → 392.36] because of our sin,
[392.58 → 393.48] the sin of the world.
[393.48 → 394.60] And we crave
[394.60 → 395.16] restoration
[395.16 → 396.10] that He promises.
[396.50 → 396.94] And knowing
[396.94 → 398.06] we all need doctors.
[398.06 → 399.46] Knowing this
[399.46 → 400.42] and then making
[400.42 → 401.26] a beeline.
[401.58 → 401.64] Right?
[401.78 → 402.48] A straight,
[403.54 → 404.28] straight,
[404.60 → 405.58] no turning to the left
[405.58 → 406.18] or to the right.
[406.40 → 407.48] A beeline to the throne
[407.48 → 408.06] of grace
[408.06 → 409.46] taking refuge
[409.46 → 410.28] in God,
[410.36 → 410.90] our Saviour.
[411.18 → 412.14] Because we all know
[412.14 → 412.88] we're not good enough.
[414.60 → 415.26] A straight,
[415.54 → 416.18] pure path
[416.18 → 416.72] in dependence
[416.72 → 417.64] of our Saviour.
[418.08 → 419.42] And through this purity,
[420.46 → 421.56] through this honesty,
[422.72 → 424.04] we are promised
[424.04 → 424.88] what Daryl Johnson
[424.88 → 425.56] in his book
[425.56 → 426.46] on the Beatitudes,
[426.46 → 427.52] what he calls
[427.52 → 429.00] the greatest promise
[429.00 → 430.32] Jesus ever made.
[431.36 → 433.20] We will see God.
[435.12 → 435.94] Now obviously,
[436.10 → 436.80] it might not have
[436.80 → 437.64] the same impact
[437.64 → 438.30] that it did
[438.30 → 439.60] for the original audience
[439.60 → 440.18] of this text.
[440.42 → 441.74] When they heard Jesus say,
[442.24 → 443.10] you will see God,
[444.22 → 444.94] they would have,
[445.58 → 446.20] in my guess,
[447.16 → 447.54] think,
[447.90 → 448.14] Jesus,
[448.28 → 448.90] you're crazy.
[449.06 → 450.02] What are you talking about?
[450.22 → 451.00] See God?
[451.46 → 452.56] If you see God,
[452.64 → 453.10] you die.
[453.10 → 455.54] God is too holy.
[456.08 → 457.68] Nobody can see him.
[458.44 → 459.28] There's no way.
[460.10 → 461.06] The holy of holies
[461.06 → 461.78] and the different
[461.78 → 463.86] curtains and boundaries
[463.86 → 464.50] that we have
[464.50 → 465.88] because God is so holy,
[465.96 → 466.80] we can't see him.
[466.82 → 467.46] And you're saying,
[467.64 → 468.78] blessed are the pure in heart.
[469.56 → 470.18] Blessed are those
[470.18 → 471.22] who know they are broken
[471.22 → 472.52] and they will see God.
[473.42 → 475.64] It is a very significant promise
[475.64 → 476.16] that God,
[476.52 → 478.28] that Jesus is making for us.
[478.68 → 479.36] For those
[479.36 → 480.98] who are pure in heart.
[480.98 → 483.44] And I want to add further here
[483.44 → 484.56] that significance
[484.56 → 486.22] of seeing God
[486.22 → 487.44] is to dwell
[487.44 → 488.40] with him forever.
[488.88 → 489.86] To be with him,
[490.88 → 492.34] be with our loving maker
[492.34 → 493.02] in eternity.
[493.66 → 495.46] And in more technical terms then,
[495.86 → 496.60] to see God
[496.60 → 497.68] refers to the coming
[497.68 → 498.38] fulfillment
[498.38 → 499.56] of his kingdom.
[500.36 → 502.40] That final restoration
[502.40 → 503.52] when his kingdom
[503.52 → 504.66] is fully established,
[504.90 → 505.90] that is to really
[505.90 → 507.28] fully see God.
[507.28 → 507.68] See!
[508.68 → 509.44] Bless you.
[509.82 → 510.30] Bless you.
[510.30 → 512.66] And we get to see God
[512.66 → 513.80] in glimpses.
[513.90 → 514.76] Just like we say,
[514.88 → 515.94] we get to glimpse
[515.94 → 516.96] a little bit
[516.96 → 517.64] of his kingdom
[517.64 → 518.80] in our everyday lives.
[519.22 → 520.00] And we want to look at
[520.00 → 520.76] what that means
[520.76 → 522.98] for our everyday lives.
[524.10 → 525.42] But before we get there,
[526.02 → 527.42] let's dig a little bit deeper
[527.42 → 529.24] into what pure in heart means.
[529.90 → 530.64] Pure in heart.
[532.12 → 532.98] The heart
[532.98 → 534.04] in the biblical sense.
[534.20 → 535.00] So we'll do a couple
[535.00 → 536.06] of word studies here.
[536.06 → 537.64] I do like to geek out
[537.64 → 538.40] and you'll notice
[538.40 → 540.22] that I love doing word studies.
[540.50 → 541.90] They give us so much
[541.90 → 542.84] meaning that we miss
[542.84 → 543.80] if we just brush by.
[543.90 → 544.46] Oh, pure in heart.
[544.56 → 545.04] Oh, it means,
[545.40 → 546.42] yeah, so we are honest
[546.42 → 546.94] about God
[546.94 → 547.96] or honest to God.
[548.58 → 549.86] But to go a little bit farther,
[550.14 → 550.64] the heart,
[550.78 → 551.94] when we say pure in heart,
[552.16 → 553.58] it doesn't obviously refer
[553.58 → 554.36] to our modern
[554.36 → 556.00] technical scientific terms
[556.00 → 557.62] to refer to the main organ
[557.62 → 558.40] that pumps blood.
[558.76 → 559.74] That's not what the biblical
[559.74 → 560.82] writers were thinking about.
[561.32 → 562.44] And it's also
[562.44 → 563.70] not our modern
[563.70 → 565.02] definition of saying,
[565.30 → 565.76] oh, the heart
[565.76 → 566.70] is where the centre
[566.70 → 568.16] of your feelings are.
[568.16 → 569.82] If somebody hurts you,
[569.88 → 570.10] you say,
[570.20 → 571.22] oh, my heart was broken.
[572.62 → 574.10] That's not the only thing
[574.10 → 574.74] that's included.
[575.26 → 575.78] The heart,
[575.90 → 576.80] in biblical terms,
[577.06 → 578.24] refers to the centre
[578.24 → 579.32] of the whole entire
[579.32 → 580.06] human being,
[580.20 → 581.46] which does include
[581.46 → 582.12] our feelings.
[582.32 → 583.32] But not just that.
[583.64 → 584.42] Our feelings,
[585.16 → 585.84] our thoughts,
[585.92 → 586.42] our thinking,
[586.64 → 587.54] and our willing.
[588.54 → 589.70] Our whole being
[589.70 → 590.56] is represented
[590.56 → 591.56] with this word heart.
[591.78 → 592.62] It is the centre
[592.62 → 593.26] of our being.
[593.26 → 595.76] So we got the heart.
[596.84 → 597.52] So the heart
[597.52 → 598.06] is the centre
[598.06 → 598.64] of our being,
[599.10 → 599.82] our thinking,
[600.22 → 600.84] our feeling,
[600.96 → 601.48] and our willing.
[602.32 → 603.00] And then now,
[603.14 → 603.40] pure.
[604.30 → 605.48] Pure comes from the word,
[605.56 → 606.26] from the Greek word
[606.26 → 606.76] Cathars,
[607.16 → 608.34] and it has the nuance,
[608.48 → 609.26] the meaning of
[609.26 → 609.88] cleansing.
[611.04 → 611.48] Unmixed,
[612.14 → 613.18] unalloyed,
[613.50 → 614.54] unadulterated.
[614.68 → 615.16] So pure,
[615.32 → 615.68] clean.
[616.20 → 616.46] Yes.
[616.94 → 617.90] That's what that means.
[618.22 → 618.80] And Cathars
[618.80 → 620.02] is where we get
[620.02 → 620.76] the English term
[620.76 → 621.54] catharsis
[621.54 → 622.38] or cathartic,
[622.62 → 623.60] like medical terms.
[624.26 → 625.46] And the definition
[625.46 → 626.52] of catharsis
[626.52 → 627.78] actually refers to,
[628.70 → 629.34] yeah,
[629.50 → 630.04] it's up there,
[630.30 → 631.60] the process of releasing
[631.60 → 632.48] and thereby
[632.48 → 633.76] providing relief
[633.76 → 634.28] from
[634.28 → 636.14] strong
[636.14 → 637.12] or repressed
[637.12 → 637.82] emotions.
[639.18 → 640.52] Strong or repressed
[640.52 → 640.96] emotions,
[641.06 → 641.72] you're letting it out.
[642.24 → 643.26] That's catharsis.
[644.08 → 645.44] So to be pure,
[645.90 → 646.18] yes,
[646.22 → 647.12] it means clean,
[647.32 → 647.74] unmixed,
[647.74 → 649.20] but it is to be
[649.20 → 650.54] unrepressed.
[652.54 → 653.20] And so this word
[653.20 → 653.94] pure captures
[653.94 → 654.98] the essence
[654.98 → 655.92] about being honest
[655.92 → 657.62] and being fully transparent,
[658.22 → 659.16] to be fully honest
[659.16 → 659.76] before God.
[660.20 → 660.46] All right,
[660.54 → 661.80] so I geeked out enough.
[662.08 → 663.62] Let's put it all together now.
[664.14 → 665.24] So with all the definitions
[665.24 → 666.56] that I've been preaching
[666.56 → 667.88] or lecturing to you about,
[668.14 → 669.18] you put it all together
[669.18 → 669.92] and then you try to
[669.92 → 671.00] redefine it from that,
[671.36 → 672.42] pure in heart.
[673.28 → 674.46] Where do we get this meaning?
[674.66 → 675.18] Pure in heart,
[675.26 → 676.36] to be honest before God.
[676.36 → 677.48] So pure,
[678.02 → 680.14] to be clean,
[680.88 → 681.46] unmixed,
[682.02 → 682.76] unrepressed
[682.76 → 683.60] in our hearts,
[683.88 → 684.80] in our feeling,
[685.20 → 685.70] thinking,
[685.94 → 686.28] and willing.
[686.54 → 687.38] I'll say that one more time.
[687.72 → 688.64] It is to have
[688.64 → 689.42] a clean,
[689.88 → 690.54] unmixed,
[690.78 → 691.54] unrepressed,
[691.78 → 692.26] feeling,
[692.52 → 692.84] thinking,
[693.04 → 693.26] willing.
[694.50 → 695.40] Our whole beings,
[695.96 → 696.96] honest before God.
[699.04 → 700.14] And so with that in mind,
[700.90 → 702.04] you read this blessing
[702.04 → 702.60] once again
[702.60 → 703.40] and paraphrase it
[703.40 → 704.12] with our definition
[704.12 → 705.34] that we just went over.
[705.34 → 707.12] This is what Jesus is saying.
[708.56 → 708.98] He's saying,
[709.12 → 709.34] blessed,
[710.18 → 711.04] congratulations,
[711.72 → 713.46] in sync with God's will,
[714.06 → 715.70] sharing God's own heart,
[716.10 → 717.30] are you who,
[717.78 → 718.62] when confronted
[718.62 → 719.74] and transformed
[719.74 → 720.76] by the gospel
[720.76 → 721.66] of Jesus Christ,
[722.06 → 723.42] bring your whole selves
[723.42 → 724.80] in all of its broken
[724.80 → 725.96] pieces and bits
[725.96 → 727.04] to God.
[727.26 → 728.54] A straight path
[728.54 → 729.30] to God
[729.30 → 729.90] and dependence
[729.90 → 730.78] of our Saviour.
[731.16 → 732.74] That's what this blessing means.
[733.02 → 734.02] Not some holy,
[734.14 → 734.74] angelic figure
[734.74 → 735.30] with a halo
[735.30 → 735.82] oh,
[735.88 → 736.64] now you're good enough.
[736.74 → 737.34] You're pure in heart,
[737.40 → 738.00] now you're blessed.
[738.34 → 738.62] No.
[739.30 → 740.12] You are honest,
[740.36 → 741.58] you are fully transparent,
[741.92 → 742.52] you are clean,
[742.76 → 743.46] unrepressed,
[743.74 → 744.76] you bring everything
[744.76 → 745.70] before God,
[745.88 → 747.08] which is exactly
[747.08 → 748.58] what we went over
[748.58 → 749.48] when we did our
[749.48 → 750.68] Psalm series last year.
[751.08 → 752.32] If anybody remembers
[752.32 → 752.84] the title
[752.84 → 753.88] of the actual series,
[754.38 → 755.04] maybe if you have
[755.04 → 755.52] good memory.
[755.52 → 758.98] Well,
[758.98 → 760.00] the banner will be up there.
[760.04 → 760.60] I want to show you
[760.60 → 761.16] what we use
[761.16 → 761.96] as the artwork.
[762.64 → 763.66] The series was called
[763.66 → 765.12] Honest to God,
[765.56 → 766.36] Praying the Psalms.
[767.00 → 768.12] Honest to God,
[768.34 → 769.04] Praying the Psalms.
[769.60 → 770.72] And one of the Psalms,
[771.50 → 772.08] Psalm 24,
[772.36 → 773.10] reads this way,
[773.10 → 774.82] who may ascend
[774.82 → 775.54] to the mountain
[775.54 → 776.14] of the Lord,
[776.20 → 776.74] of Yahweh,
[776.80 → 777.32] our God,
[777.32 → 778.70] who may stand
[778.70 → 780.12] in His holy place,
[781.34 → 781.92] the one
[781.92 → 783.60] who has clean hands
[783.60 → 786.06] and a pure heart,
[786.68 → 787.94] pure heart,
[788.26 → 789.52] who does not trust
[789.52 → 790.02] in an idol
[790.02 → 790.64] or swear
[790.64 → 791.78] by a false god,
[793.30 → 794.24] the pure in heart.
[794.24 → 796.44] They,
[796.88 → 797.54] the pure in heart,
[797.64 → 799.14] will receive blessing
[799.14 → 800.14] from Yahweh
[800.14 → 801.12] and vindication
[801.12 → 802.20] from God their Saviour.
[802.72 → 803.96] Such is the generation
[803.96 → 805.62] of those who seek Him,
[806.76 → 808.24] who seek your face,
[808.38 → 809.02] God of Jacob.
[810.30 → 811.56] Seek God's face.
[812.44 → 813.24] You see Him.
[813.90 → 814.80] That's what we're promised.
[816.20 → 816.48] And so,
[816.62 → 817.72] take a look at the banner art
[817.72 → 818.26] that we use.
[819.38 → 820.86] The different hand shapes,
[821.24 → 821.96] different emotions
[821.96 → 822.70] that are represented
[822.70 → 823.64] by those hands.
[824.24 → 825.54] That's what we talked about.
[826.84 → 828.20] Whatever feelings you have,
[828.30 → 829.72] whatever prayers you have,
[830.00 → 831.14] whatever you're going through,
[831.48 → 832.42] whether it be joy,
[832.66 → 832.98] anger,
[833.14 → 833.64] anxiety,
[833.88 → 834.28] lament,
[834.62 → 835.56] or thanksgiving,
[836.24 → 837.16] whatever it is,
[837.24 → 838.96] it is toward God.
[841.66 → 842.08] And so,
[842.24 → 842.52] again,
[842.94 → 843.38] pure in heart
[843.38 → 844.40] does not mean perfect.
[844.92 → 845.72] It means we bring
[845.72 → 846.64] our honest selves
[846.64 → 847.30] into the light
[847.30 → 848.54] of God's truth
[848.54 → 849.16] and grace.
[850.08 → 850.88] A beeline
[850.88 → 852.14] to the throne of grace
[852.14 → 853.26] made possible
[853.26 → 854.22] because that's
[854.22 → 854.86] the good news
[854.86 → 855.82] of Jesus' death
[855.82 → 856.80] and resurrection.
[857.36 → 858.72] We can take refuge
[858.72 → 859.38] and depend
[859.38 → 860.60] on our loving Father.
[861.76 → 862.48] We are gifted
[862.48 → 863.54] that freedom.
[864.10 → 865.40] We are no longer bound
[865.40 → 866.46] because of our sins.
[866.82 → 867.56] We are honest.
[867.64 → 868.60] We can be honest.
[868.88 → 869.58] You can bring them
[869.58 → 870.62] all before God,
[870.70 → 871.88] whatever you're going through.
[872.42 → 873.54] And God is always
[873.54 → 874.22] waiting there
[874.22 → 875.42] with open arms,
[876.12 → 877.52] with His unconditional love.
[877.52 → 879.16] Just like we would want
[879.16 → 880.52] even our own children
[880.52 → 882.68] to run into
[882.68 → 883.70] our loving arms.
[884.54 → 884.82] Even,
[885.62 → 886.62] I say if here
[886.62 → 887.26] in my manuscript,
[887.40 → 888.10] it shouldn't be if.
[888.28 → 889.08] Even when,
[889.36 → 890.06] because they will.
[890.62 → 891.80] They will mess up
[891.80 → 892.94] and they will rebel
[892.94 → 893.62] against us.
[894.16 → 895.10] And even when
[895.10 → 895.86] they do that,
[896.58 → 897.22] we want,
[897.36 → 898.10] and our desire
[898.10 → 898.78] is to reflect
[898.78 → 899.76] God's love,
[900.12 → 901.30] to receive them
[901.30 → 902.16] with open arms,
[902.16 → 903.96] with our unconditional love.
[903.96 → 906.64] easier said than done.
[906.76 → 907.02] Yes.
[907.76 → 908.02] Yes,
[908.10 → 909.46] and to be honest,
[909.86 → 910.06] yes,
[910.10 → 911.26] I do sometimes feel like
[911.26 → 911.82] I want to just
[911.82 → 912.82] kick Joseph out the door
[912.82 → 913.08] and say,
[913.22 → 915.14] I just had enough with you.
[915.58 → 916.32] Enough with you.
[916.42 → 917.32] We had a little bit
[917.32 → 917.80] of an episode
[917.80 → 918.60] at the end of camp
[918.60 → 919.76] like yesterday too.
[920.08 → 920.94] And the feeling,
[921.06 → 922.48] the natural broken
[922.48 → 923.92] lack of love
[923.92 → 924.66] in my heart
[924.66 → 925.88] is to just say,
[926.00 → 926.22] Joe,
[926.30 → 926.84] I give up.
[927.46 → 927.76] Fine,
[927.76 → 928.44] have it your way.
[928.66 → 929.88] You go do your own thing.
[930.20 → 931.04] I don't love you anymore.
[932.32 → 933.88] That's my broken self.
[933.96 → 934.40] Speaking.
[934.78 → 935.54] When I know,
[936.08 → 936.82] just like God,
[936.88 → 937.86] I want to reflect
[937.86 → 939.10] unconditional love
[939.10 → 940.88] no matter how annoying
[940.88 → 941.40] you are,
[941.68 → 942.72] no matter how much
[942.72 → 943.72] you are not listening
[943.72 → 944.32] to the sense
[944.32 → 945.16] that I'm telling you
[945.16 → 946.28] that the right way
[946.28 → 946.88] to do this
[946.88 → 948.06] is like this,
[949.38 → 951.60] I still want to love you.
[952.62 → 953.50] And it's difficult.
[954.10 → 955.08] And just like that,
[955.30 → 956.22] we get a glimpse
[956.22 → 957.12] of God's love
[957.12 → 957.94] through parenthood.
[959.72 → 960.84] We ourselves
[960.84 → 961.74] are open.
[962.04 → 962.68] We are gifted.
[962.68 → 964.08] We are allowed
[964.08 → 964.96] to freely come
[964.96 → 965.54] to the Lord
[965.54 → 967.20] with all of our brokenness
[967.20 → 968.40] and our honest selves
[968.40 → 969.52] and lean into
[969.52 → 971.28] His unconditional love.
[973.48 → 974.18] And so again,
[974.98 → 975.66] the psalmist says
[975.66 → 976.80] in Psalm 139,
[977.42 → 977.90] he says,
[978.62 → 979.40] Search me, God,
[980.10 → 981.30] and know my heart,
[981.74 → 982.58] my feelings,
[983.22 → 984.02] my thinking,
[984.58 → 985.18] my willing,
[985.62 → 986.30] all of me.
[986.46 → 987.02] Know me.
[987.34 → 987.94] Search me.
[988.18 → 988.92] And test me.
[989.18 → 990.46] And know my anxious thoughts.
[990.46 → 991.84] See if there is
[991.84 → 993.64] any offensive way in me.
[994.06 → 995.14] And lead me
[995.14 → 995.98] in the way
[995.98 → 996.88] of everlasting.
[997.62 → 998.36] Lead me
[998.36 → 999.74] to the throne of grace.
[1000.20 → 1001.42] Lead me to Jesus.
[1003.90 → 1005.02] St. Francis
[1005.02 → 1006.10] also continues
[1006.10 → 1007.68] and says to his disciple Leo,
[1008.00 → 1008.50] he says,
[1008.90 → 1009.86] Even the desire
[1009.86 → 1010.50] for holiness
[1010.50 → 1012.26] is transformed
[1012.26 → 1013.32] into a pure
[1013.32 → 1014.42] and simple
[1014.42 → 1015.86] desire for Jesus.
[1017.86 → 1018.78] Lead me
[1018.78 → 1019.40] to the throne
[1019.40 → 1020.08] of grace.
[1020.88 → 1021.74] And so at this point,
[1021.82 → 1022.72] I want to invite you
[1022.72 → 1023.32] to imagine.
[1024.18 → 1024.92] Imagine with me
[1024.92 → 1025.32] right now,
[1025.36 → 1026.00] all of us here,
[1026.84 → 1028.24] if we would all
[1028.24 → 1029.12] be pure in heart
[1029.12 → 1030.18] at this moment.
[1030.60 → 1031.56] That we would bring
[1031.56 → 1032.96] everything to God.
[1033.04 → 1033.70] All of us.
[1033.80 → 1034.62] All of our thinking,
[1034.82 → 1035.04] feeling,
[1035.16 → 1035.52] and willing
[1035.52 → 1036.42] to God
[1036.42 → 1036.80] that we would
[1036.80 → 1037.84] purely seek Him
[1037.84 → 1038.26] right now.
[1038.96 → 1039.78] Imagine we all
[1039.78 → 1040.72] did this.
[1041.90 → 1042.68] And everyone's
[1042.68 → 1043.48] just purely looking
[1043.48 → 1044.04] to God
[1044.04 → 1045.16] and praying to Him.
[1045.16 → 1048.72] our whole honest selves.
[1050.58 → 1051.52] And then I want
[1051.52 → 1052.26] to throw the question
[1052.26 → 1052.86] out to you.
[1054.00 → 1055.14] After we become
[1055.14 → 1055.66] pure
[1055.66 → 1056.66] and we come
[1056.66 → 1057.34] before God,
[1057.78 → 1058.76] if I were to ask
[1058.76 → 1059.28] the question,
[1059.62 → 1060.28] who would be
[1060.28 → 1061.08] left standing,
[1061.80 → 1062.50] proud of their
[1062.50 → 1063.06] own status
[1063.06 → 1064.24] and their own
[1064.24 → 1064.88] accomplishments
[1064.88 → 1065.86] before God
[1065.86 → 1067.56] if we are all
[1067.56 → 1068.04] honest
[1068.04 → 1069.08] with ourselves?
[1070.54 → 1071.58] And who would be
[1071.58 → 1072.24] of the posture
[1072.24 → 1073.14] like that Pharisee
[1073.14 → 1073.72] in the parable
[1073.72 → 1075.02] who prays
[1075.02 → 1075.56] a prayer
[1075.56 → 1076.48] of thanksgiving
[1076.48 → 1077.64] and prays
[1077.64 → 1078.20] because He's
[1078.20 → 1078.84] not like that
[1078.84 → 1080.02] sinful tax collector
[1080.02 → 1080.40] over there
[1080.40 → 1080.86] in the corner
[1080.86 → 1081.86] who can't even
[1081.86 → 1082.64] lift His head up
[1082.64 → 1083.14] because He's
[1083.14 → 1083.74] too guilty?
[1085.26 → 1086.02] And Jesus,
[1086.20 → 1087.02] He just leaves us
[1087.02 → 1087.62] with the question,
[1087.90 → 1088.64] who left home
[1088.64 → 1089.22] justified?
[1091.90 → 1092.98] What's He saying
[1092.98 → 1093.58] to us here?
[1095.10 → 1096.30] If we are really
[1096.30 → 1097.46] honest and pure
[1097.46 → 1099.34] and transparent
[1099.34 → 1100.18] as we come
[1100.18 → 1100.54] to God
[1100.54 → 1100.94] in prayer,
[1101.64 → 1102.42] who can be
[1102.42 → 1103.00] left standing,
[1103.00 → 1104.72] proud that I
[1104.72 → 1105.72] am holy enough,
[1105.94 → 1107.08] I am good enough,
[1107.48 → 1108.22] God will now
[1108.22 → 1109.52] obviously bless me.
[1114.70 → 1115.74] And like the
[1115.74 → 1116.14] parable,
[1117.04 → 1118.72] we seek
[1118.72 → 1119.70] to reflect
[1119.70 → 1120.88] righteousness
[1120.88 → 1121.90] that we looked
[1121.90 → 1122.38] at before.
[1122.96 → 1123.70] That shalom
[1123.70 → 1124.58] relationship with
[1124.58 → 1124.86] God,
[1125.08 → 1126.10] not out of guilt.
[1127.06 → 1127.64] When we are
[1127.64 → 1128.06] honest,
[1128.24 → 1128.46] yes,
[1128.56 → 1129.18] there is guilt
[1129.18 → 1129.92] because we know
[1129.92 → 1130.62] we are sinners
[1130.62 → 1131.46] and we know
[1131.46 → 1132.08] we are all
[1132.08 → 1132.92] guilty of our
[1132.92 → 1133.46] brokenness
[1133.46 → 1134.48] and we deserve
[1134.48 → 1134.98] judgment,
[1135.26 → 1136.04] but God said
[1136.04 → 1137.16] out of His grace,
[1137.50 → 1138.20] it is out of
[1138.20 → 1138.86] my love,
[1139.14 → 1139.74] my mercy,
[1139.90 → 1140.46] my grace
[1140.46 → 1141.24] that you are saved,
[1141.30 → 1142.28] not by works.
[1142.52 → 1144.28] It is my gift
[1144.28 → 1145.00] to you.
[1145.34 → 1145.90] And gifts
[1145.90 → 1146.56] are free.
[1147.60 → 1148.66] That's the definition
[1148.66 → 1149.14] of gift.
[1150.60 → 1151.32] And that's what
[1151.32 → 1152.08] we're called to.
[1152.30 → 1153.36] Not our proud
[1153.36 → 1154.08] status and
[1154.08 → 1154.72] accomplishments,
[1155.24 → 1156.42] but knowing
[1156.42 → 1157.70] with full honesty
[1157.70 → 1158.24] that we're not
[1158.24 → 1158.66] good enough,
[1158.74 → 1159.48] but God says
[1159.48 → 1160.42] you are good
[1160.42 → 1160.74] enough.
[1161.42 → 1162.18] By the blood
[1162.18 → 1162.72] of the Lamb,
[1162.84 → 1163.64] you are now
[1163.64 → 1164.84] made righteous.
[1165.94 → 1166.70] I credit
[1166.70 → 1167.60] you as
[1167.60 → 1168.30] righteous before
[1168.30 → 1168.54] me.
[1169.64 → 1170.26] And that's
[1170.26 → 1170.84] the promise,
[1170.96 → 1171.30] isn't it?
[1172.32 → 1173.34] That's the promise
[1173.34 → 1174.16] that Jesus makes,
[1174.22 → 1175.08] the greatest promise
[1175.08 → 1175.74] ever made.
[1176.14 → 1176.70] He says,
[1177.18 → 1177.78] those who are
[1177.78 → 1178.42] pure in heart,
[1179.14 → 1180.18] you will see
[1180.18 → 1180.88] God.
[1181.84 → 1182.60] You will see
[1182.60 → 1183.16] God.
[1183.80 → 1184.48] The ultimate
[1184.48 → 1185.52] hope we have,
[1185.82 → 1186.56] the climax
[1186.56 → 1187.48] of the grand
[1187.48 → 1188.36] biblical story
[1188.36 → 1189.14] as we have it.
[1189.60 → 1190.28] And as Pastor
[1190.28 → 1191.32] Tim preached
[1191.32 → 1192.24] a couple of weeks ago,
[1192.46 → 1193.38] that's the longing
[1193.38 → 1194.14] that all of us
[1194.14 → 1195.16] have for that
[1195.16 → 1197.02] full restoration
[1197.02 → 1197.90] of our home,
[1198.14 → 1199.34] that new creation
[1199.34 → 1199.90] that we are
[1199.90 → 1200.52] looking for.
[1201.42 → 1202.30] That home is
[1202.30 → 1202.78] where we get
[1202.78 → 1203.44] to fully see
[1203.44 → 1204.04] God as well.
[1204.54 → 1205.04] I read again
[1205.04 → 1205.68] from Revelation.
[1206.06 → 1206.56] Then I saw
[1206.56 → 1207.14] a new heaven
[1207.14 → 1207.90] and a new earth,
[1208.30 → 1209.12] for the first heaven
[1209.12 → 1210.24] and the first earth
[1210.24 → 1211.04] has passed away.
[1211.16 → 1211.78] And then he goes
[1211.78 → 1213.08] on in chapter 22.
[1213.44 → 1213.80] He says,
[1214.10 → 1214.74] no longer
[1214.74 → 1215.70] will there
[1215.70 → 1216.62] be any curse.
[1216.98 → 1217.42] The throne
[1217.42 → 1217.90] of God
[1217.90 → 1218.64] and of the Lamb
[1218.64 → 1219.78] will be in the city
[1219.78 → 1221.04] and his servants,
[1221.26 → 1221.62] us,
[1221.90 → 1222.80] will serve him.
[1223.24 → 1223.98] They will
[1223.98 → 1226.62] see his face.
[1227.84 → 1229.28] We will see him,
[1229.56 → 1230.50] live with him,
[1230.66 → 1231.36] dwell with him
[1231.36 → 1232.02] in eternity.
[1232.50 → 1233.40] And his name
[1233.40 → 1234.96] will be on their foreheads,
[1235.08 → 1236.68] will be on our foreheads.
[1236.86 → 1238.32] He will be in our minds,
[1238.60 → 1239.34] in our willing,
[1239.52 → 1240.24] in our feeling.
[1240.62 → 1241.46] All of us,
[1241.46 → 1242.64] our whole selves
[1242.64 → 1243.90] will be with him
[1243.90 → 1245.04] in his kingdom
[1245.04 → 1245.50] to come.
[1248.84 → 1249.80] And so what does
[1249.80 → 1250.66] this all mean
[1250.66 → 1251.78] for us today?
[1252.84 → 1253.28] Yes,
[1253.36 → 1254.22] that ultimate hope
[1254.22 → 1254.96] that we live in.
[1255.54 → 1256.34] It's all well and good.
[1256.82 → 1257.64] That's the grand
[1257.64 → 1258.50] biblical story.
[1258.60 → 1259.44] That's the good news
[1259.44 → 1260.74] we live in.
[1261.30 → 1262.24] That's our story.
[1262.60 → 1263.64] But what does that mean
[1263.64 → 1264.74] when I walk out the doors
[1264.74 → 1265.72] after church today?
[1266.72 → 1267.88] How does that look?
[1267.98 → 1268.66] And how does that
[1268.66 → 1269.68] even matter to me
[1269.68 → 1270.90] that we live
[1270.90 → 1271.74] in this ultimate hope?
[1271.74 → 1274.34] A couple of suggestions
[1274.34 → 1274.90] that I had.
[1276.02 → 1276.50] First,
[1277.06 → 1278.20] you get to receive,
[1278.34 → 1279.30] for those who receive
[1279.30 → 1280.00] this blessing,
[1280.68 → 1281.48] those who hear
[1281.48 → 1282.54] this blessing this morning,
[1282.90 → 1283.62] you are invited
[1283.62 → 1284.30] to come
[1284.30 → 1286.08] to the throne of grace
[1286.08 → 1286.84] freely
[1286.84 → 1288.24] and depend on him.
[1289.08 → 1289.44] Why?
[1289.88 → 1290.90] Because God
[1290.90 → 1291.96] is always sitting
[1291.96 → 1293.00] at his throne of grace
[1293.00 → 1294.50] and he's always waiting
[1294.50 → 1295.32] with open arms
[1295.32 → 1296.98] with his unconditional love.
[1297.64 → 1299.20] There is nothing,
[1299.60 → 1300.60] there's no one
[1300.60 → 1301.54] that can satisfy
[1301.54 → 1302.20] the longing
[1302.20 → 1303.04] that we have.
[1303.96 → 1305.04] Like C.S. Lewis said,
[1305.32 → 1306.66] the God-sized hole
[1306.66 → 1308.10] will never be satisfied
[1308.10 → 1308.90] with anything
[1308.90 → 1309.48] that the world
[1309.48 → 1310.58] can provide for us.
[1311.52 → 1312.42] So the invitation
[1312.42 → 1314.02] is to come before him
[1314.02 → 1315.38] and receive
[1315.38 → 1316.34] and lean into
[1316.34 → 1317.56] his unconditional love.
[1318.06 → 1319.26] Because knowing
[1319.26 → 1321.34] in our Western culture
[1321.34 → 1322.70] and our Western world
[1322.70 → 1323.74] has done a great job
[1323.74 → 1324.72] of just emphasizing
[1324.72 → 1325.98] just the knowing,
[1326.18 → 1327.02] intellectual part.
[1327.02 → 1329.88] God wants all of you,
[1330.32 → 1331.20] your whole being,
[1331.50 → 1332.12] your heart,
[1332.76 → 1333.54] to be pure
[1333.54 → 1334.52] and transparent
[1334.52 → 1335.26] and honest
[1335.26 → 1336.36] and come to him.
[1338.60 → 1339.60] God is waiting
[1339.60 → 1340.58] and the invitation
[1340.58 → 1341.04] is there
[1341.04 → 1342.12] to come to him
[1342.12 → 1344.06] with all your whole selves.
[1344.48 → 1344.92] And then,
[1345.08 → 1345.74] the second part
[1345.74 → 1347.26] is that the beautiful truth
[1347.26 → 1348.52] of being blessed
[1348.52 → 1349.12] like this
[1349.12 → 1350.10] is that
[1350.10 → 1351.16] you don't really
[1351.16 → 1352.00] have a choice
[1352.00 → 1353.24] to not be
[1353.24 → 1354.44] a blessing for others.
[1354.44 → 1356.10] We always say
[1356.10 → 1356.70] you're blessed
[1356.70 → 1357.80] to be a blessing
[1357.80 → 1358.38] for others.
[1359.32 → 1360.20] And it is
[1360.20 → 1361.26] one of our mandates,
[1361.38 → 1362.34] so one of our commands,
[1362.74 → 1363.66] part of our identity
[1363.66 → 1364.44] that we live out.
[1365.36 → 1366.50] But you honestly
[1366.50 → 1367.30] have no choice.
[1367.74 → 1368.50] When you receive
[1368.50 → 1369.50] blessing from God,
[1369.60 → 1370.92] you radiate blessing.
[1372.00 → 1372.96] You radiate that.
[1373.18 → 1374.96] You shine God's light.
[1375.54 → 1376.42] It's not your own.
[1377.56 → 1378.04] And so,
[1378.16 → 1379.06] when you are blessed,
[1379.66 → 1380.28] you become
[1380.28 → 1381.04] a reflection
[1381.04 → 1382.38] of God's presence,
[1382.78 → 1383.72] God's face
[1383.72 → 1384.34] for others.
[1385.18 → 1386.34] That they will
[1386.34 → 1387.38] see God through you.
[1389.30 → 1389.94] And so,
[1390.10 → 1391.22] to end this morning,
[1391.34 → 1392.12] I want to leave you
[1392.12 → 1392.72] with a charge
[1392.72 → 1393.22] that Jesus
[1393.22 → 1394.52] tells us himself
[1394.52 → 1395.36] in Matthew 25.
[1395.98 → 1396.52] He says,
[1396.68 → 1397.78] like the pure in heart
[1397.78 → 1399.28] will see God.
[1399.74 → 1400.44] And you can ask
[1400.44 → 1400.86] the question,
[1400.98 → 1401.18] okay,
[1401.40 → 1402.28] what does it mean
[1402.28 → 1403.00] to see God
[1403.00 → 1403.98] in our everyday lives,
[1404.02 → 1404.56] in our homes,
[1404.64 → 1405.44] in our workplaces,
[1405.84 → 1406.44] every day
[1406.44 → 1407.08] when I'm changing
[1407.08 → 1407.56] the diaper?
[1407.70 → 1407.82] Like,
[1407.86 → 1408.42] what do you mean
[1408.42 → 1409.40] seeing God?
[1409.88 → 1410.62] What does that mean?
[1412.02 → 1413.20] And we get inspiration
[1413.20 → 1413.78] from what Jesus
[1413.78 → 1414.48] tells us here
[1414.48 → 1415.22] in Matthew 25.
[1416.10 → 1416.58] We read,
[1417.02 → 1417.26] Lord,
[1417.76 → 1419.48] when did we see you
[1419.48 → 1420.54] hungry and feed you?
[1420.66 → 1421.80] Or thirsty and give you
[1421.80 → 1422.54] something to drink?
[1423.32 → 1425.10] When did we see you,
[1425.20 → 1425.74] a stranger,
[1426.02 → 1426.92] and invite you in,
[1427.20 → 1427.92] needing clothes
[1427.92 → 1428.54] and clothes you?
[1429.10 → 1431.14] When did we see you
[1431.14 → 1432.88] sick or in prison
[1432.88 → 1433.60] to visit you?
[1433.60 → 1435.90] And then the king,
[1436.50 → 1437.16] and then Jesus
[1437.16 → 1437.90] will reply,
[1438.58 → 1439.88] truly I tell you,
[1440.28 → 1441.24] whatever you did
[1441.24 → 1442.54] for the least of these
[1442.54 → 1443.38] brothers and sisters
[1443.38 → 1443.90] of mine,
[1444.56 → 1445.58] you did for me.
[1447.34 → 1448.44] You did for me.
[1450.50 → 1450.98] Servanthood,
[1452.24 → 1452.90] hospitality,
[1453.68 → 1454.12] caring,
[1454.56 → 1455.10] generosity
[1455.10 → 1456.18] for those
[1456.18 → 1457.06] who are the least
[1457.06 → 1458.00] in our societies,
[1458.50 → 1459.32] in our churches,
[1459.74 → 1460.62] in our homes,
[1460.74 → 1461.62] in our workplaces,
[1461.62 → 1462.80] in our schools,
[1463.60 → 1464.62] in our marriages,
[1465.42 → 1469.02] to reflect God's love,
[1469.44 → 1470.66] to reflect this blessing,
[1470.96 → 1472.52] is to see God
[1472.52 → 1473.44] and for them
[1473.44 → 1474.48] to see God
[1474.48 → 1475.16] through you.
[1475.16 → 1478.56] It is our calling
[1478.56 → 1479.44] to be a blessing
[1479.44 → 1480.68] because we are blessed.
[1480.88 → 1482.40] It's such a natural rhythm.
[1483.46 → 1484.08] Go camping.
[1484.64 → 1486.02] If you have extra food,
[1486.24 → 1487.08] it's so just
[1487.08 → 1488.36] human instinct
[1488.36 → 1488.98] to say,
[1489.32 → 1489.48] hey,
[1490.06 → 1491.04] I see you're
[1491.04 → 1492.80] lacking some supplies.
[1493.74 → 1494.58] Maybe I shouldn't say this,
[1494.62 → 1495.84] but I forgot to take beer
[1495.84 → 1496.50] to camping.
[1497.94 → 1498.84] And I was just
[1498.84 → 1499.74] so thirsty.
[1500.24 → 1501.54] I had a couple of bubblies,
[1501.64 → 1502.64] but they went really warm
[1502.64 → 1503.34] really fast.
[1503.34 → 1505.40] And then a newcomer,
[1505.82 → 1506.46] he's not been
[1506.46 → 1507.04] at our church,
[1507.16 → 1507.94] he's a friend
[1507.94 → 1509.00] of one of our young adults,
[1509.24 → 1510.36] he just invited me in
[1510.36 → 1511.00] and he said,
[1511.10 → 1511.20] hey,
[1511.28 → 1512.30] I'm cooking dinner right now,
[1512.34 → 1513.00] are you still hungry?
[1513.46 → 1513.70] Oh,
[1513.76 → 1514.94] and I also have a cold one.
[1516.16 → 1516.84] And then,
[1517.08 → 1517.70] I'll leave it up
[1517.70 → 1518.34] to your imagination
[1518.34 → 1518.86] when I did.
[1519.64 → 1520.34] But it's just,
[1521.38 → 1522.86] the things that we have,
[1523.26 → 1524.76] our instinct is to share,
[1525.20 → 1526.80] to want to share at least.
[1527.56 → 1528.72] And so when we receive
[1528.72 → 1529.32] the blessing
[1529.32 → 1531.10] that we get to see God
[1531.10 → 1532.32] as we come honestly
[1532.32 → 1532.96] before Him,
[1533.34 → 1535.32] that's what we desperately want
[1535.32 → 1536.86] for others to see as well.
[1537.10 → 1538.30] I want my brother
[1538.30 → 1539.42] to see that as well.
[1540.78 → 1543.20] I want them to come see God.
[1546.00 → 1547.74] And it's not to be legalistic
[1547.74 → 1548.08] and say,
[1548.20 → 1548.26] oh,
[1548.30 → 1549.10] I have to be good enough
[1549.10 → 1550.04] so that they see God
[1550.04 → 1550.56] through me,
[1550.74 → 1552.08] but it is a blessing
[1552.08 → 1552.96] that we receive
[1552.96 → 1553.98] when we're honest
[1553.98 → 1555.30] and humble before God.
[1555.70 → 1557.28] God works through us.
[1557.80 → 1559.16] People will see God
[1559.16 → 1559.70] through you.
[1559.70 → 1561.12] That's the blessing
[1561.12 → 1562.30] and the charge
[1562.30 → 1563.68] that we get to see,
[1563.92 → 1564.74] that we get to hear,
[1564.82 → 1565.32] I should say,
[1565.64 → 1566.82] that we get to leave with
[1566.82 → 1568.08] when we leave the doors here.
[1568.66 → 1569.70] That is the blessing
[1569.70 → 1570.62] for you this morning.
[1571.82 → 1572.46] Let's pray.
[1572.46 → 1581.14] loving Father,
[1581.26 → 1582.34] we come before you
[1582.34 → 1585.68] and all we can say
[1585.68 → 1586.36] is, thanks.
[1588.76 → 1589.24] Lord,
[1589.68 → 1591.02] what have we done
[1591.02 → 1591.96] that we are good enough
[1591.96 → 1593.32] to receive your blessing,
[1593.72 → 1594.48] your presence,
[1594.74 → 1596.18] your love for us?
[1596.18 → 1600.40] through your love,
[1601.06 → 1602.22] through the work on the cross,
[1602.30 → 1602.84] you have said
[1602.84 → 1604.20] that you have loved us,
[1604.50 → 1605.72] you have gifted us
[1605.72 → 1606.80] with your presence,
[1607.78 → 1609.14] that you promise us
[1609.14 → 1611.26] that we would get to see you,
[1611.82 → 1613.16] that we would get to dwell
[1613.16 → 1614.72] and live with you
[1614.72 → 1615.68] forever in your kingdom.
[1617.28 → 1619.36] May we reflect your presence
[1619.36 → 1620.12] here and now
[1620.12 → 1622.28] as we reflect your kingdom
[1622.28 → 1624.16] every day in our lives.
[1624.16 → 1628.20] gift us those little glimpses
[1628.20 → 1629.06] that we get to see
[1629.06 → 1630.92] and may we be thankful
[1630.92 → 1633.18] that we get to experience
[1633.18 → 1634.60] and get a little taste
[1634.60 → 1636.02] of what that kingdom living
[1636.02 → 1636.62] looks like.
[1637.72 → 1638.98] I pray a blessing.
[1639.60 → 1640.74] I pray that you would
[1640.74 → 1641.46] strengthen us,
[1641.52 → 1642.22] that you would guide us
[1642.22 → 1643.16] by your spirit,
[1643.76 → 1644.84] that you would work
[1644.84 → 1645.48] in our lives,
[1646.00 → 1647.02] that it wouldn't be
[1647.02 → 1648.48] just our own efforts,
[1648.60 → 1649.48] our own brokenness,
[1649.52 → 1650.38] but you would use
[1650.38 → 1651.52] all of our brokenness
[1651.52 → 1652.80] for your glory
[1652.80 → 1653.68] and for your kingdom.
[1654.16 → 1655.76] May that be reflected
[1655.76 → 1656.72] in our lives
[1656.72 → 1658.32] every day,
[1658.58 → 1660.26] every moment of our lives
[1660.26 → 1661.52] that we would reflect
[1661.52 → 1662.18] your presence.
[1663.08 → 1663.74] Be with us
[1663.74 → 1665.30] as we sing your praises
[1665.30 → 1666.30] and head out the doors
[1666.30 → 1666.94] of this building
[1666.94 → 1668.16] to be a blessing
[1668.16 → 1668.84] for the world.
[1669.26 → 1670.06] In Jesus' name we pray.
[1670.86 → 1671.16] Amen.
[1672.56 → 1673.82] I invite you to stand
[1673.82 → 1674.52] as we sing
[1674.52 → 1675.56] our song of response.
[1675.56 → 1676.12] Thank you.
