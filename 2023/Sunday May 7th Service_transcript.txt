[0.00 --> 8.52]  good morning
[8.52 --> 17.00]  before I get into the message I just wanted to
[17.80 --> 21.52]  point out the
[21.52 --> 28.32]  all the programs I was just struck with the announcements and you know
[28.32 --> 34.38]  all the Clayton Festival and Tot Romp and Storytime
[34.38 --> 38.40]  and all these things that and I want to
[38.40 --> 42.12]  emphasize is that we do and
[42.12 --> 45.84]  I'm just going to encourage you we had a pickleball tournament
[45.84 --> 50.58]  the last few days and Linda Watkins ahead of that
[50.58 --> 54.08]  but it's an attempt to bring together the people outside
[54.08 --> 60.14]  and the people within and that intention is there and trying to do that in every area
[60.14 --> 66.96]  we can but we need you so I just want to encourage you to pitch in somewhere so
[66.96 --> 70.64]  you can help the vision that God has for this church to be lived out
[70.64 --> 77.52]  another thing I want to say is this Monday Jonathan graduates from Regents
[77.52 --> 84.52]  he's officially finished his studies and we're excited for him and as he so
[84.52 --> 94.58]  so now he's ready to fill Dave's shoes so that's a that's a good thing
[94.58 --> 101.28]  it's good for us to worship together it's good for us to explore God's Word
[101.28 --> 107.76]  together and today we begin a new series on the Beatitudes the way of blessing
[107.76 --> 116.04]  and this is Jesus words out of Matthew 5 and I'm going to do some setting up in
[116.04 --> 119.70]  this message today we're going to start dealing with each of the Beatitudes
[119.70 --> 123.20]  kind of one at a time but I'm going to kind of give a bit of a bird's-eye view
[123.20 --> 130.00]  here I want you to picture a crowd so when you're reading Beatitudes picture who's
[130.00 --> 135.10]  hearing this picture crowd sitting in a natural amphitheater on the side of a
[135.10 --> 141.10]  hill by the Sea of Galilee big lake there's fishermen there's tax collectors
[141.10 --> 147.40]  religious leaders tradesmen mothers children ordinary people broken hurting
[147.40 --> 155.26]  oppressed people people like you and I listening to this new preacher named Jesus
[155.26 --> 162.16]  sharing about the gospel the good news of God saying the kingdom of God has come
[162.16 --> 170.38]  near people say what kingdom of God has come near to tell me more not the Roman
[170.38 --> 174.52]  kingdom not the one that's oppressing us God's kingdom what does that mean and
[174.52 --> 181.36]  more importantly what does that mean to my life and Jesus spoke the most
[181.36 --> 186.58]  revolutionary revolutionary words ever spoken and I invite you to join us I
[186.58 --> 190.96]  invite you to picture yourself sitting on the side of that hill listening to Jesus
[190.96 --> 197.62]  words to sit at Jesus feet and to hear those revolutionary words and now you
[197.62 --> 204.28]  asking the same question well what does that mean to my life so let's read them
[204.28 --> 214.68]  together out of Matthew 5 now when Jesus saw the crowd he went up on the mountainside and he sat down the
[214.68 --> 225.76]  disciples came to him and he began to teach them he said blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[225.76 --> 237.76]  heaven blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth
[237.76 --> 244.72]  blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled
[244.72 --> 255.58]  blessed are the mercy merciful for they will be shown mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God
[255.58 --> 261.46]  blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of God
[261.46 --> 268.54]  blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[268.54 --> 275.52]  blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you
[275.52 --> 283.70]  because of me rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for you in the same way they persecuted the
[283.70 --> 309.70]  prophets who were before you and we hear all these these eight blessed are statements and some of them don't really sound like blessings do they and that Jesus starts this these statements these blessed are statements to describe the kind of people who begin to emerge when God's kingdom breaks into their lives
[309.70 --> 339.68]  the first time you will feel that it turns everything upside down but the second time you read it you discover that it turns everything right side up the first time you read it it feels like it's impossible the second time you feel nothing else is possible
[339.68 --> 365.68]  this is what we're going to be looking at over the next number of weeks but I want you to get some context because sometimes we take a passage but what comes around it that helps us make more sense of the passage we're looking at John the Baptist the one Jesus cousin who was announced his coming he has been arrested
[365.68 --> 393.68]  Jesus ministry has been arrested Jesus ministry has now begun and he has been saying things like repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand he calls followers Peter and Andrew a fisherman to follow him then James and John and these followers go with them throughout Galilee proclaiming the kingdom healing the sick blessing the people and large crowds begin to gather
[393.68 --> 413.68]  after and after he first proclaims the gospel the good news the kingdom and the kingdom here and he calls his followers then he shares the beatitudes so you've got to kind of have all those pieces okay this is all leading up to sharing the beatitudes
[413.68 --> 434.68]  Jesus in essence walks into our lives he calls us to follow him into a whole new kind of living because of him the long awaited kingdom is breaking into the world scripture said the time is fulfilled we've been seeing this even throughout the old testament and we pass from one era into a whole new era
[434.68 --> 451.68]  pastor dave did that last week those of you in the eleven dave did a five minute sermon uh with a diagram on that some that transitioning of one kingdom to another king or one era to another era the recreating reign of god is invading the broken world
[451.68 --> 456.68]  the good news the good news your sins are forgiven but there's more
[456.68 --> 476.68]  you are invited or you are adopted into the family of god but there's more you have eternal life but there's more right now god's new world order is breaking into your broken life and the world's life as well
[476.68 --> 485.48]  so yes repent change your thinking think in you turn around all that is repentance listen to the good news
[485.48 --> 491.06]  and it's in that context that jesus then speaks the beatitudes
[491.06 --> 497.40]  repenting involves becoming a beatitude people a blessed are people
[497.40 --> 503.94]  jesus is painting a new picture of you and i and what we live how we live
[503.94 --> 509.08]  a portrait of a portrait of a people in whom the gospel has taken hold
[509.08 --> 517.42]  just let that sink in a little bit this gospel needs to take hold of your whole life
[517.42 --> 525.14]  what does that mean what does that look like he's describing a transformed humanity
[525.14 --> 528.68]  so
[528.68 --> 532.52]  we live in a beautiful world
[532.52 --> 534.40]  one god created
[534.40 --> 541.48]  we decided to go it alone that's the story of adam and eve right you will be like god we still sometimes try to do that
[541.48 --> 542.36]  and then
[542.36 --> 547.08]  as we saw in in genesis we fell as we rebelled we called it the fall
[547.08 --> 550.02]  no sooner had we rebelled though that god made a promise
[550.02 --> 565.96]  no sooner had we go to god's death no more god's kingdom established through jesus emmanuel god with us
[565.96 --> 573.18]  and in in his beatitudes jesus is simply describing what happens to human beings
[573.18 --> 577.92]  when the gospel grabs a hold of them the whole of them
[577.92 --> 582.02]  this is a profile of the new humanity
[582.02 --> 584.76]  when god's reign breaks into our brokenness
[584.76 --> 588.68]  so there's a that's a lot going on there
[588.68 --> 592.84]  that that you i'd love you to contemplate that for your own life
[592.84 --> 597.70]  now let me give you some thoughts about the beatitudes as a whole
[597.70 --> 601.04]  before we start taking them one at a time in the weeks to come
[601.04 --> 604.56]  with each beatitude the phrase
[604.56 --> 608.20]  for theirs is the kingdom is attached or at least implied
[608.20 --> 612.02]  blessed are those who mourn for theirs is the kingdom
[612.02 --> 613.40]  okay
[613.40 --> 616.22]  blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom
[616.22 --> 620.08]  blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for theirs is the kingdom
[620.08 --> 623.76]  the merciful the pure in heart for theirs is the kingdom the peacemaker
[623.76 --> 630.04]  for theirs is the kingdom the kingdom comes with these beatitude attributes
[630.04 --> 638.08]  beatitudes are are different dimensions of the kingdom breaking into a life
[638.08 --> 642.28]  we see what god god's new humanity is all about
[642.28 --> 647.08]  being comforted inheriting the earth
[647.08 --> 651.58]  right relatedness justice receiving and giving mercy
[651.58 --> 655.82]  serving god being his children theirs is the kingdom
[655.82 --> 662.94]  them and only them the poor the meek the pure in heart the peacemakers the
[662.94 --> 666.48]  persecuted implying that those who are not poor in spirit
[666.48 --> 669.60]  do not grasp what it is to receive the kingdom
[669.60 --> 673.48]  it is not sinking in those who are not meek
[673.48 --> 677.06]  aren't inheriting kingdom life because that's part of being
[677.06 --> 683.06]  in kingdom life they are not if you're not a peacemaker you're not acting like
[683.06 --> 684.18]  god's kids
[684.18 --> 688.50]  another thing to note
[688.50 --> 692.28]  jesus is not describing eight different people
[692.28 --> 695.56]  well there's that meek one and there's that peacemaker one
[695.56 --> 698.14]  and there's the that one and that one that one right
[698.14 --> 703.10]  one meek one poor in spirit rather eight qualities found in one person
[703.10 --> 709.26]  in all followers of jesus qualities that emerge from every kingdom follower
[709.26 --> 712.82]  so you can't go around saying well you know i'm not really a meek type
[712.82 --> 716.78]  that's not an option following jesus involves
[716.78 --> 722.70]  becoming meek when you follow jesus so the poor in spirit are also meek the meek are
[722.70 --> 727.14]  also pure in heart the also merciful yes search searching and hungering for
[727.14 --> 732.82]  righteousness as part of that one beatitude flows into the next poverty and spirit
[732.82 --> 738.98]  which is knowing that i don't know what it takes i don't have it in me results in in
[738.98 --> 743.78]  mourning which leads to meekness which to lead to gentleness which creates a thirst
[743.78 --> 750.26]  for things to be right which leads to mercy and purity each beatitude is interpreted by the
[750.26 --> 757.14]  other beatitudes what one through six describe how what a peacemaker is like they all
[757.14 --> 763.54]  belong together peacemakers who know their own poverty who mourn the brokenness in their own
[763.54 --> 769.14]  lives and in the life of the world who the the meek who recognize their own powerlessness
[770.66 --> 777.06]  they long for justice and right relationships and yeah they get into trouble sometimes when they bump
[777.06 --> 781.86]  against the dog-eat-dog world and then they are persecuted they push up against those things
[781.86 --> 790.90]  they're just so sequential flow that begins with poverty and spirit here's a quote from john
[790.90 --> 797.62]  uh chris chrisisdom he's a fourth century early church father and he said it this way it's a little
[797.62 --> 804.02]  really old he said therefore you see in each instance by the form of precept making way for the
[804.02 --> 812.34]  following one jesus has woven a sort of golden chain for us the first thus first he that is humble will
[812.34 --> 819.38]  also surely mourn for his own sins and i might add the sins of the world he that so mourns will be both
[819.38 --> 826.02]  meek and righteous and merciful he that is merciful and righteous and contrite will of course also be
[826.02 --> 834.74]  pure in heart and such a one will be a peacemaker too and you see this this flow that happens when
[834.74 --> 841.70]  we follow christ and we live in christ and then we live this beatitude type life and then another thing
[841.70 --> 848.50]  i'd like to point out in in looking at these beatitudes the word blessed blessed are okay what do we mean by
[848.50 --> 857.70]  the word blessed the word blessed is is a loaded word comes from a greek word makarios and often that's
[857.70 --> 864.98]  translated happy so you know you see you get some weird things happier those who mourn doesn't sound
[864.98 --> 870.18]  very happy does it anyway i'll leave that when we talk about that what do we mean happy i think the word
[870.18 --> 876.02]  happy though is misleading uh i think it's a little too weak because i think it's often interpreted as
[876.02 --> 881.46]  everything kind of going my way it becomes about circumstances so i'm happy because everything's
[881.46 --> 888.98]  going well that's not what we're talking about here makarios does not refer to how we assess our
[888.98 --> 897.54]  condition rather how god does whether we are happy in a certain circumstance is really not the main point
[898.26 --> 905.94]  this is about how god feels about me and my condition so happy isn't really
[905.94 --> 910.42]  really i think the best synonym there have been other attempts to okay what word are we going to
[910.42 --> 916.66]  use when we think of the word blessed i've read the word approved approved is the one who mourns
[916.66 --> 922.74]  approved is the peacemaker somewhat helpful i read the word congratulations congratulations of those who
[922.74 --> 927.94]  mourn i mean all kinds of interesting uses of the word still though i think the focus ends up being too much
[927.94 --> 935.70]  on you on me better and this is daryl johnson whose material we're using for the series quite a bit
[936.58 --> 945.70]  better is johnson says the word right side up right side up sometimes jesus is described as bringing the
[945.70 --> 952.10]  upside down kingdom right he turns everything upside down and and i do like that but really in a way it's
[952.10 --> 960.74]  better said he brings the right side up kingdom it's only called upside down because uh our old humanity
[960.74 --> 967.22]  is at work and so things are upside down normally because that's how we've made them there's a lack
[967.22 --> 974.82]  of peace because we've made it a lack of peace we might say uh another way of saying it is we're in sync
[974.82 --> 985.62]  we're in sync with the gospel bless you uh makarios then the blessed are the those that those who are in
[985.62 --> 994.26]  sync with the gospel they align themselves with the gospel the those those who are poor in spirit are in
[994.26 --> 1003.46]  sync those who mourn are in sync with the gospel and the kingdom come these qualities i want to point out
[1003.46 --> 1012.66]  to are not natural to us this is crucial i think to keep in mind when we look at the beatitudes one at a
[1012.66 --> 1023.38]  time none of us can produce these qualities in and of ourselves jesus didn't come uh into into galilee
[1023.38 --> 1028.74]  looking for beatitude people you know with a bit of a check you got to find some meek ones got to find
[1028.74 --> 1033.22]  you know some poor spirit ones you know he didn't go in that way you know a
[1033.22 --> 1038.18]  peter you're a beatitude kind of guy follow me no that's not that's not what's going on here he
[1038.18 --> 1045.14]  called broken people to himself into his kingdom and as a result of knowing him and and hanging out
[1045.14 --> 1051.62]  with him and submitting to his will uh there that then he his blessings his qualities appear in their
[1051.62 --> 1056.90]  life they become more and more like christ because they walk with him
[1056.90 --> 1063.86]  so don't go away you know when you read the beatitudes and i hope you do and reflect on them
[1063.86 --> 1068.02]  don't don't go away saying something like well i'm really going to nail down meekness
[1070.10 --> 1075.38]  right i'm going to i'm going to work on meekness this week no no no here's what you really need to do
[1075.38 --> 1083.22]  what we always need to do surrender yourself again to jesus reign in your life allow him to form meekness
[1083.22 --> 1092.50]  in you don't try to muscle it you know in a way it's it's not a therefore but a because because you
[1092.50 --> 1100.90]  are poor in spirit the kingdom is breaking in because you are poor in spirit if if it were true therefore we
[1100.90 --> 1107.46]  would then try to be poor in spirit right if you're poor in spirit therefore right it we would try to
[1107.46 --> 1113.86]  be poor in spirit and and then we would try to earn it so we can get the blessings that's not what's
[1113.86 --> 1121.62]  going on here and we would end up being proud of how good we are at humility right and then we have
[1121.62 --> 1130.02]  that ridiculous kind of sense here where i am super good at humility and everybody knows that just sounds
[1130.02 --> 1140.18]  all wrong the beatitudes are result of surrender of repenting of giving up our will for his
[1141.30 --> 1147.94]  of embracing the reign of jesus in our lives more and more and more never the result of our own efforts
[1147.94 --> 1154.42]  and i'm not saying that you shouldn't be trying but that's not going to get you where you want to be
[1154.42 --> 1162.58]  you want to be with jesus that's where you want to be rather and then with his spirit we become more and
[1162.58 --> 1172.02]  more people who live like jesus describes in the beatitudes we're going to have communion together this
[1172.02 --> 1181.86]  morning and i'm it's an invitation for all those who want to be like jesus who want an encounter with
[1181.86 --> 1190.34]  jesus to guide their lives jesus says do this in remembrance of me do this remembering i'm the one
[1190.34 --> 1196.34]  you follow and who strengthens you jesus says blessed are you basically when you're at the end of your
[1196.34 --> 1201.54]  rope when you're exhausted and despairing when when tears are your food day and night blessed are you who
[1201.54 --> 1206.34]  forgive that person will hurt you even though they didn't even say sorry you who are ridiculed and
[1206.34 --> 1212.82]  humiliated and left out and timid the ones who who work toward peace instead of the easy road of
[1212.82 --> 1214.02]  vengeance or quitting
[1217.70 --> 1226.18]  blessed are you so much of how we interpret these blessings depends on where we are sitting when we
[1226.18 --> 1234.50]  hear them let's move the i asked you to pitch yourself on a hillside now i ask you to pitch yourself around
[1234.50 --> 1244.10]  the big table and jesus invites the religious leader in jesus time would elbow their way to the table
[1244.10 --> 1250.42]  knowing they should have a spot because they're the religious leaders we can get that way too
[1252.26 --> 1254.82]  we can come with our righteousness on full display
[1256.74 --> 1259.46]  my life it's all really working out well for me
[1259.46 --> 1265.14]  i'm a blessed person hashtag blessings this is who we this is who i am
[1269.78 --> 1272.34]  the beatitude should make us uncomfortable
[1274.98 --> 1279.94]  because god is celebrating who we try so hard not to be
[1279.94 --> 1284.10]  dependent needy
[1284.66 --> 1286.18]  desperate people
[1288.66 --> 1289.86]  dependent needy
[1290.42 --> 1291.62]  desperate people
[1292.90 --> 1297.94]  he said come to me all you who are weary the truth of the matter is we're all weary sometime
[1298.50 --> 1299.06]  and often
[1300.26 --> 1301.46]  and i will give you rest
[1302.34 --> 1305.46]  jesus is saying i have a place for you at the table
[1305.46 --> 1310.58]  a place for you at the table you who are needy and broken and dependent
[1312.02 --> 1318.74]  and it seems these blessings that that jesus gives in the beatitudes he's pulling the examples
[1318.74 --> 1325.06]  from the very people he's been talking to you know he's looking at people and he knows their stories
[1325.06 --> 1331.06]  he said blessed are you family you yeah i know you blessed are you family you who lost a loved one
[1331.06 --> 1333.38]  blessed are you in your mourning
[1337.06 --> 1345.38]  blessed are you and he's looking at somebody else you in the midst of that conflict even there i give you the peace to share peace
[1348.10 --> 1349.86]  and he looks around the table and he sees you
[1351.14 --> 1355.94]  there you sit at the table you don't even feel like you belong blessed are you in your weeping
[1355.94 --> 1362.26]  in your struggling in your hungering and thirsting for rightness in your forgottenness in your real life
[1363.54 --> 1364.42]  blessed are you
[1367.70 --> 1368.50]  no pretending
[1371.86 --> 1373.70]  the kingdom is for you
[1378.18 --> 1380.34]  i think the kids are i hear them coming
[1383.62 --> 1385.06]  give them a chance to get in here
[1386.74 --> 1387.54]  parents you can
[1390.02 --> 1391.22]  snag them when they come by
[1395.22 --> 1397.86]  come on in boys and girls go find your parents
[1399.94 --> 1411.86]  all right
[1415.94 --> 1417.38]  jesus
[1417.38 --> 1420.34]  jesus says to us
[1422.02 --> 1426.34]  he said this on the night he was betrayed he said this is my body
[1428.10 --> 1430.02]  given for you
[1432.82 --> 1433.86]  so you can be blessed
[1433.86 --> 1437.14]  and he said
[1437.14 --> 1439.38]  this is my blood
[1439.38 --> 1442.18]  shed for you
[1442.18 --> 1446.58]  so you can be blessed with being clean
[1446.58 --> 1451.06]  and he says
[1451.06 --> 1452.18]  and he says
[1452.26 --> 1468.96]  them
[1468.96 --> 1477.96]  I am with you always I invite you to go to one of the tables the stations before
[1477.96 --> 1482.68]  you and I elders and deacons you can go to those tables at this time and I
[1482.68 --> 1489.00]  invite you to go to the table and take holy communion when you get you get it
[1489.00 --> 1493.20]  you can take it back to your seat and eat and drink it right away but know
[1493.20 --> 1498.70]  that in Jesus you are blessed
