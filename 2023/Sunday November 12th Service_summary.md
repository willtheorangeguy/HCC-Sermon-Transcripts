• Ruth finds herself working in the field of Boaz, a relative of her late husband and a close guardian of their family
• Boaz notices Ruth and offers her protection and provision while she works in his field
• Ruth returns to Naomi with a significant amount of barley and shares it with her mother-in-law
• Naomi blesses Boaz for showing kindness to them and considers him a potential suitor for Ruth's hand in marriage
• The speaker tells a story about delivering a mini excavator to a homeowner when they were 17 years old.
• The truck's weight lifted off the ground due to the weight of the excavator, causing it to slide down a steep driveway and crash into the homeowner's car.
• The homeowner was understanding and told the speaker's boss not to get mad at them.
• The speaker is relieved that no charges were pressed against them.
• Unexpected kindness is a theme in the book of Ruth
• The Hebrew word "hesed" (meaning loyalty, faithfulness, compassion, and kindness) appears throughout the book
• God shows His kindness to the outsider family through ordinary people expressing their kindness
• The story of Ruth 2 is broken up into three sections or scenes
• Boaz is introduced as a man of standing, worth, value, and wealth, known for his good character and high respect in the community
• Definition of gleaning: a practice in the Old Testament where farmers leave behind some of their crops for the poor and foreigners
• The gleaning command is found in Leviticus, specifically Leviticus 19:9-10, which instructs farmers to leave behind some of their crops for the vulnerable
• Gleaning was likely not practiced often, as it would have been difficult and dangerous for a single foreign female worker like Ruth
• The story of Ruth highlights Boaz's character, particularly his kindness and respect towards Ruth, who is a vulnerable woman in his field
• Boaz takes steps to protect Ruth from the workers in the field and ensures her safety
• Boaz shows kindness to Ruth by providing for her needs
• He expresses his character as one who wants to care for someone
• The prayer of blessing he prays over Ruth is motivated by his recognition of her good character
• Unbeknownst to Boaz, God will use him to answer his own prayer and bless Ruth, Naomi, and ultimately the people through their family lineage
• God uses acts of care and kindness to bless, protect, and take care of people
• Boaz shows hospitality by inviting Ruth to join his workers for a meal
• In ancient Near Eastern culture, it was unusual for the wealthy to serve the poor, but Boaz reverses this role by serving Ruth
• Boaz instructs his workers to allow Ruth to collect barley from the sheaves of barley, allowing her to gather more food
• Ruth returns home with an ephah (20-50 pounds) of barley
• The owner of a field is named Boaz, who is also a guardian redeemer for Naomi and Ruth.
• In the context of ancient Israelite culture, a guardian redeemer was responsible for ensuring their people's needs were met and providing financial support if they fell into debt or difficulty.
• This concept is significant because it foreshadows Jesus' role as the redeemer in Galatians 4, who rescues people from slavery to sin, death, and temptation.
• The concept of a kinsman redeemer, as seen in the story of Ruth and Boaz
• Connection between Jesus and the kinsman redeemer, with similarities in their roles and actions
• Charles Spurgeon's work connecting the book of Ruth to Jesus
• A quote from Charles Spurgeon highlighting similarities between Boaz and Jesus
• The concept of redemption through Jesus Christ, specifically referencing Caden's situation
• The idea that Jesus' death and resurrection brought about redemption for humanity
• The connection between Jesus' actions and making humans fully human again
• The kindness of God is experienced in concrete, tangible acts through other people
• The hand of God can be seen through the love and kindness of others
• Examples of experiencing God's kindness include:
	+ A listening ear from a close friend during crisis
	+ Someone opening their home for a newcomer
	+ Sacrificial generosity to pay off debt
	+ Thoughtful acts such as meals being brought to those in need
	+ Forgiveness and grace offered by someone hurt by the individual
• The story of Caden illustrates how ordinary human acts of kindness can lead to conversions and experiencing God's goodness.
• People are being called by God to use their resources (money, time, talents) for others
• This can happen in everyday life through ordinary actions and words
• The kindness of God is shown in ordinary ways, as seen in the story of Ruth 2
• Jesus came to create a community filled with his resurrection power and the Spirit's life
• Members are praying for guidance on how to care for those around them and show God's kindness
