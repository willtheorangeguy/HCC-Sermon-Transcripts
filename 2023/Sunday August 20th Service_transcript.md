[0.00 --> 5.04]  um we are starting a new sermon series today for the next four weeks and this sermon series is
[5.04 --> 10.64]  called your story and just a bit of backstory behind what this series is about it actually
[10.64 --> 14.32]  comes from some conversation with people who are new to our church new to the christian faith
[14.32 --> 18.16]  and they said hey like we didn't grow up in the church we didn't grow up with christianity we'd
[18.16 --> 22.80]  love for you to do some teaching on some of the basics of what you believe about the bible about
[22.80 --> 26.96]  christianity and so the way we're going to do this series is we're going to start with the gospel like
[26.96 --> 31.60]  what is the gospel that's today's sermon and next week jonathan's going to be preaching on the story
[31.60 --> 36.16]  of the bible then we're going to look at the story of our culture and then finally on kickoff sunday
[36.16 --> 40.48]  september 13 we're going to look at what does it mean to be faithful as a church living at the
[40.48 --> 45.04]  crossroads between our cultural story and living faithfully in the biblical story so that's where
[45.04 --> 48.40]  we're going and if you're new to the christian faith i'm just thankful you're here for the
[48.40 --> 53.76]  conversation and i had people after the 9 a.m service ask me a bunch of questions uh so you're
[53.76 --> 57.44]  welcome to approach any of us as leaders and pastors we'd love to be part of a conversation
[57.44 --> 64.24]  if these sermons stir up those questions if you have a bible turn with me to first corinthians 15
[64.96 --> 70.56]  we're going to read verses 1 to 8 where paul literally says this is what i believe is the good news
[77.04 --> 82.80]  now brothers and sisters i want you to remind you of the gospel i preached to you which you received
[82.80 --> 88.96]  and on which you have taken your stand by this gospel you are saved if you hold firmly to the
[88.96 --> 96.00]  word i preached to you otherwise you've believed in vain for what i received i passed on to you as of
[96.00 --> 102.08]  first importance that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures that he was buried
[102.64 --> 107.76]  that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures and that he appeared to cephas that's
[107.76 --> 113.52]  peter and then to the 12 after that he appeared to more than 500 of the brothers and sisters at the
[113.52 --> 119.12]  same time most of whom are still living though some have fallen asleep then he appeared to james
[119.12 --> 124.56]  then to all the apostles and last of all he appeared to me also as to one abnormally born
[124.56 --> 138.00]  well the dad paced around the hall of the hospital anxiously just a few minutes prior to that his
[138.00 --> 143.36]  wife was delivering what he was hoping to be their firstborn child and then all of a sudden a doctor
[143.36 --> 147.44]  came in the room and he called in another doctor and there's voices talking back and forth and all
[147.44 --> 151.60]  of a sudden they rushed his wife out of the delivery room into a surgery room far down the hall
[151.60 --> 158.16]  and there he stood waiting wondering what's going on was his wife okay was the child okay were they
[158.16 --> 163.36]  going to make it and then what felt like an eternity later a nurse at the very end of the hall
[163.36 --> 168.96]  popped through the doors and she was pushing this cart which had a little baby in it and she said to
[168.96 --> 176.72]  the dad good news here is your baby daughter she's healthy and your wife is going to be just fine too
[176.72 --> 185.52]  well you can imagine the wash of relief and joy fill that dad as he held his baby girl good news
[187.76 --> 192.48]  now of the many things that can be said about christianity we really do believe that the center
[192.48 --> 201.76]  of what we believe is good news not good advice not good ideas good news something happened that has to
[201.76 --> 208.40]  be shared something has taken place that we need to receive and talk about that's at the center of
[208.40 --> 214.08]  the christian faith and interestingly when the gospel writers put their quill to scroll and they tell
[214.08 --> 220.56]  the story of jesus and what he did the word they use the greek word is euangelion you know what that means
[221.44 --> 228.24]  gospel you know what gospel means good news they couldn't help but talk about jesus without saying
[228.24 --> 234.56]  the person that we're telling you about the things that happened to him are good news and that's why
[234.56 --> 239.04]  the first four books in the new testament are the gospel of luke the gospel of john the gospel of matthew
[239.04 --> 246.32]  the gospel of mark it's good news and when paul talking to the church in corinth starts talking about
[246.32 --> 252.16]  the the deep center of what they believe he says let me read it for you brothers and sisters i want to
[252.16 --> 258.80]  remind you of the gospel the good news i preach to you which you have received and on which you take
[258.80 --> 268.48]  your stand by this gospel the good news you are saved now i want to name a challenge that we live in
[268.48 --> 275.84]  or have now that we live in the 21st century it's been 2023 years since jesus and as the the christianity
[275.84 --> 280.48]  has spread in different places there's different denominations people answer differently the question
[280.48 --> 285.76]  what is the gospel in fact in surge our discipleship group that we have every year at hope i often will
[285.76 --> 292.40]  get people when they start this group to say hey what do you say is the gospel let me ask you you know
[292.40 --> 295.76]  let's say you get into an elevator with someone you're going up 10 floors and they know you're
[295.76 --> 300.64]  a christian that is it hey like what's your faith all about what is the gospel that christians talk
[300.64 --> 306.48]  about what would you say what's your one to two to three sentence summary of the christian faith
[306.48 --> 314.08]  that you hold what would you say you thinking about it keep that in your mind because we're
[314.08 --> 319.60]  going to come back to that question now if you're curious or you're confused even what you would say
[319.60 --> 325.92]  paul is here to help because in this passage paul's talking to a very broken church you know this is a
[325.92 --> 329.84]  church that gets not one letter but two letters it's never a good sign when you get two letters from
[329.84 --> 333.84]  paul it's like i've already written you now i'm writing you again and i read a meme just like two
[333.84 --> 338.48]  weeks ago where it said you know if jesus or sorry paul visited our city in our churches
[339.20 --> 345.68]  we'd be getting a letter too but in this letter to a very broken church paul near the end says all
[345.68 --> 351.28]  right this is the center of what we believe this is what makes us church these are the convictions
[351.28 --> 357.92]  that change the world and this is what he writes starting at verse three for what i received i pass on
[357.92 --> 364.88]  to you as of first importance number one that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures
[364.88 --> 369.92]  number two that he was buried and there's some debate about people thinking maybe he was resuscitated he
[369.92 --> 375.44]  didn't actually die so no he was buried number three that he was raised on the third day according to
[375.44 --> 383.36]  the scriptures and number four that he appeared to peter the twelve more than 500 and then also to paul
[383.36 --> 390.32]  himself there is a lot packed in this passage let me say the first thing number one notice how important
[390.32 --> 396.00]  this is to paul he says what i'm about to tell you is the most important thing you can know about and
[396.00 --> 402.56]  believe in nothing is more important than jesus and what was accomplished in his life death and
[402.56 --> 410.00]  resurrection and you must reckon with that if you come to believe in him he is therefore the foundation
[410.00 --> 415.04]  of everything you live for and nothing else can be more important not your money not your time not
[415.04 --> 424.24]  your relationships everything is built on jesus nothing is more important secondly i want to suggest
[424.24 --> 430.88]  that it's really important that we recognize that christianity is not just ideas or morals or good
[430.88 --> 435.04]  teaching on how to live a lot of people when you ask them what's christianity oh it's this guy who gave
[435.04 --> 439.68]  some good teachings on how we're supposed to live that is true jesus did that but at the center of
[439.68 --> 445.44]  christianity is an event something happened interestingly i just read a few weeks ago there
[445.44 --> 450.56]  was a fellow who tried to compile all the teachings of different religious literature so he took the
[450.56 --> 456.16]  quran he took the bible he took the grant sahib the sikh literature and he tried to distill everything
[456.16 --> 462.24]  down to like 400 specific teachings and he said there it is all the religious teachings buy my book you've
[462.24 --> 466.32]  got everything you don't need to go to all these different religious literatures there it is you can live by
[466.32 --> 471.04]  these 400 things and when i heard about that i thought he missed the whole point of christianity
[471.04 --> 476.16]  because christianity at the center is not just about ideas on how to live your life it's about
[476.16 --> 481.28]  something that happened to a person in the first century and there are well over 500 witnesses who said
[481.28 --> 488.16]  this jesus who lived in the first century a jewish man lived he was died that was witnessed and he rose and
[488.16 --> 495.28]  that was witnessed and we must then wrestle with what it means everyone has to make sense of that event we
[495.28 --> 498.88]  have to take seriously the testimony of these people and say okay if it's true that jesus rose
[498.88 --> 508.96]  from the dead what does that mean now here's the thing we can't talk about jesus without telling a
[508.96 --> 514.00]  story you can't say anything really meaningful about jesus without saying okay what's what's he there
[514.00 --> 517.60]  for why did he come what were his claims what is the story that makes sense of his life and that's
[517.60 --> 522.96]  actually true of all of us our lives only make sense within a story the events of our lives only make
[522.96 --> 528.00]  sense within a story a good example of this not my favorite but it works is a murder mystery anyone
[528.00 --> 533.52]  here like good murder mysteries the murder mystery at most anyway they start with an event how someone
[533.52 --> 538.16]  died the event you know someone got hit with a candlestick in the library and then the rest of
[538.16 --> 543.44]  the story the movie is giving you plausible narratives that make sense of why that event happened
[543.44 --> 547.84]  and the same is true of jesus there's an event his life his death his resurrection his appearance to
[547.84 --> 553.36]  people and now we have to say what's the story that makes sense of what jesus did and there were
[553.36 --> 558.96]  stories then you know in the roman world they saw jesus as some strange religious zealot who's sort of
[558.96 --> 563.68]  stirring people up making pretty big claims about being a king challenging the emperor and so they
[563.68 --> 568.40]  said that's enough of that we're going to execute you and show you who's boss you are not then there
[568.40 --> 573.20]  are the jews who said hey this guy's a heretic he's claiming to be god he's just a human and they think
[573.20 --> 578.32]  this guy got what he deserved he was crucified that's the end of that and today of course there's
[578.32 --> 584.64]  lots of different narratives for jesus most people say interesting religious rabbi lots of teachings on
[584.64 --> 589.44]  how to live definitely did not rise from the dead let's move on with our lives and enjoy the gifts of
[589.44 --> 597.60]  science and technology to lead us to a better world but a story makes sense of jesus and paul tells us the
[597.60 --> 603.60]  story we need to ground jesus in did you notice what he repeats twice in our passage what's the phrase
[603.60 --> 611.84]  he repeats twice in our passage according to the scriptures jesus died for our sins according to our
[611.84 --> 616.88]  scriptures he rose on the third day according to the scriptures and when paul says according to the
[616.88 --> 622.96]  scriptures he's talking about the old testament story he's saying that's the story that makes sense
[622.96 --> 628.72]  of why jesus came that's the story jesus himself was living in and claiming to fulfill you can't
[628.72 --> 636.56]  understand jesus without the old testament story you know who else by the way told us to make sense of
[636.56 --> 644.00]  jesus life in light of the old testament jesus did one of my favorite stories in the bible the road to
[644.00 --> 650.48]  emmaus luke chapter 24 jesus in his resurrected state he's got his body walking away from jerusalem he
[650.48 --> 654.64]  finds these two travelers who are distraught discouraged they thought jesus was something but
[654.64 --> 659.28]  he died they're walking away in sadness jesus comes along and he starts listening to them talking to
[659.28 --> 663.52]  them they invite jesus in for for a meal could you imagine this scene and they're eating with him
[663.52 --> 669.68]  and all of a sudden their eyes are opened and he says i want to tell you from the beginning how i
[669.68 --> 675.68]  fulfill the law and the prophets how the old testament is all fulfilled in what i have done on the cross
[675.68 --> 681.68]  jesus the resurrected savior says the story that makes sense of me is the old testament
[683.04 --> 688.00]  now you should know next sunday pastor jonathan is going to be preaching on the whole story of the
[688.00 --> 693.52]  bible no pressure no pressure at all jonathan and i'm going to do my best not to steal from jonathan's
[693.52 --> 698.64]  sermon but i'm going to steal from jonathan's sermon right now because you can't talk about the
[698.64 --> 702.96]  gospel without the story and you can't understand the story without the gospel and so i am shamelessly
[702.96 --> 706.72]  stealing from his sermon next week that's okay he's got to do the whole bible in one sermon he'll
[706.72 --> 713.60]  forgive me later i think we believe that the bible is not just a random collection of stories
[714.24 --> 718.48]  and when i was a youth pastor that's how students sought a random collection of confusing stories
[718.48 --> 724.72]  it is one unfolding narrative from beginning to end it starts with a beautiful creation that god places
[724.72 --> 731.68]  humans in to enjoy to cultivate to develop and it finishes with a perfected creation that humans get
[731.68 --> 737.52]  to enjoy in the presence of god again it starts with a garden it finishes with the city it starts
[737.52 --> 742.80]  with god dwelling with us in this world and it finishes with god dwelling with us in this world
[744.24 --> 751.04]  in the middle we get the plot and near the beginning we get the problem we'll talk about this more next
[751.04 --> 757.36]  week but the problem that comes into god's good creation is humans saying to god we'll take it from here
[757.36 --> 763.28]  we'll rule the show we'll live by our own measure we'll push you at a distance and out of that comes
[763.28 --> 770.64]  this awful parasitic reality of sin and before i say any more about sin if you're new to the faith or
[770.64 --> 775.20]  you're asking questions about the faith i just want to say this every person has to make sense of the
[775.20 --> 780.56]  mess of this world every person needs to give some explanation whether it's in the back of their head or
[780.56 --> 785.84]  it's spoken out loud you need to make sense of the mess and the bible does a phenomenal job
[786.48 --> 793.04]  making sense of the mess the old testament is brutally honest about injustice violence hatred
[793.04 --> 798.32]  warfare all of it is in the bible because it's honest about the problem and they know where it came
[798.32 --> 804.80]  from human rebellion which breaks relationship with god it ruptures relationships with each other
[804.80 --> 810.40]  family friends all of it it puts us at a difference and not in sync with our creation itself and even
[810.40 --> 816.88]  puts us at odds with ourselves we are not integrated whole people anymore we're broken our compromised
[816.88 --> 823.12]  desires mess with us and we make a mess of our lives as we chase after idols as we put our hopes and things
[823.12 --> 827.92]  that can't save us as we try to find meaning outside of a relationship with the living god the old
[827.92 --> 835.68]  testament tells story after story of humans chasing after destruction because of sin but the plot moves
[835.68 --> 843.20]  forward because god who sees his world descend into pain descend into corruption says i will not let
[844.00 --> 851.20]  humans wreck my good creation i will not let humans have the last word over the creation that i say
[851.92 --> 858.56]  good and so god builds relationship with israel he draws them to himself he reveals his intentions and
[858.56 --> 863.36]  over and over and over and over he shows them i'm in control and i'm making all things new
[865.28 --> 870.08]  at the end of the old testament actually throughout it you find the people of god and even other nations
[870.72 --> 876.56]  experiencing the brutality of a broken world crying out for saving crying out for justice crying out for
[876.56 --> 882.48]  the poor to be rescued crying out for god to give forgiveness over sin and then in the middle of the story
[882.48 --> 891.68]  we get this jewish man who has the audacity to get out into the public and say these audacious words
[892.64 --> 903.20]  good news the kingdom of god is near repent and believe now if i had more time i'd go into a lot of
[903.20 --> 909.36]  detail but i'm just going to summarize jesus statement very briefly when jesus says good news what he means to
[909.36 --> 918.00]  say is the power of god the authority of god to deal with the problem of sin to stand against the
[918.00 --> 925.36]  oppressive deception of satan and to overturn the finality of the grave that has come through jesus
[926.24 --> 930.72]  and jesus has the audacity to say i know what you've been waiting for i know what the world is groaning in
[930.72 --> 938.64]  and i've come to do what only god can do the kingdom of god is near what a bold claim
[939.92 --> 948.56]  right off the bat good news world i've come to do what only god can do now when we asked earlier
[948.56 --> 954.24]  how you would answer the question what is the gospel i have a guess at what some of you said in your
[954.24 --> 959.28]  heads and in the 9 a.m service i had only one person nod with honesty i'm guessing that the first
[959.28 --> 965.92]  thing that came to your mind was jesus died for my sin is that true oh only a couple more honest people
[965.92 --> 970.72]  it's a good answer jesus did die for our sin and he did release us from satan so that we don't go to
[970.72 --> 974.96]  hell because that's often how it's framed jesus died for our sins we're freed from it so that we
[974.96 --> 980.88]  don't go to hell we live with him in heaven but you know what people often do is we skip over his life
[981.60 --> 987.20]  and i think that's too bad because jesus life often helps us understand what his death is all of
[987.20 --> 999.76]  the way the world's supposed to be the way the world relation the way relationships are supposed
[999.76 --> 1003.36]  to be the way we're supposed to treat one another the way supposed to live the way our bodies are
[1003.36 --> 1008.08]  supposed to work all of it and if you've been at hope before you'll know that i talk about jesus
[1008.08 --> 1013.76]  miracles as a snapshot of the kingdom of god when he heals bodies that are diseased it's his way of
[1013.76 --> 1020.00]  saying bodies in my good world are meant to be healthy when he casts out demons he's saying demonic
[1020.00 --> 1025.12]  power should not have any authority over bodies and people when he calms a storm he's saying it
[1025.12 --> 1031.68]  was not created for the world to be in disorder and forest fires and tsunamis jesus gives us a picture
[1031.68 --> 1036.48]  of how the world's supposed to be at the beginning and the way it will be at the end and i want to
[1036.48 --> 1041.60]  read an extended quote this comes from a fellow named mark sayers australian if you ever hear a podcast
[1041.60 --> 1046.08]  of his his it's so much better than a canadian voice because that australian accent so hear his
[1046.08 --> 1051.12]  australian accent but here's what he says about jesus life and i just love this quote he writes
[1051.68 --> 1059.76]  jesus life on earth points us toward the future his actions act as clues showing us how the story of
[1059.76 --> 1066.40]  creation will continue in the future jesus healing of the disabled points to a time when humans will be
[1066.40 --> 1072.32]  healed physically and mentally jesus deliverance of those possessed by evil demons point to a future
[1072.32 --> 1078.00]  when evil will be expelled from god's world jesus feeding of those without food is a glimpse of a
[1078.00 --> 1083.84]  future where the world will there be no hunger poverty or starvation by turning over the tables of
[1083.84 --> 1088.40]  the merchants selling religious products in the temple jesus shows that our future will be a time when
[1088.40 --> 1096.16]  our worship of god will not be compromised by corruption and greed jesus honoring of women samaritans
[1096.16 --> 1103.12]  and children speaks of a time when no humans will be marginalized and above all jesus resurrection
[1103.12 --> 1111.92]  speaks of a time when death and suffering will be defeated and the world will be resurrected then he ends
[1111.92 --> 1116.96]  on this light and fluffy note sadly though most christians miss these illusions living as we do
[1116.96 --> 1123.28]  under the shadow of the hyper real world and we'll come back to that in a few weeks time as well do
[1123.28 --> 1128.40]  you hear what he's saying though when jesus lives and he's demonstrating with power the kingdom he's
[1128.40 --> 1133.44]  showing us this is where the future is going bodies will be healed the creation will be restored lives
[1133.44 --> 1138.32]  will be forgiven demons will be cast out and all will be made as it was created to be from the beginning
[1138.32 --> 1145.84]  when i return when i first started learning this stuff it blew my mind
[1147.28 --> 1150.80]  when i was a young adult and i started reading about the unity of the story of the bible all of
[1150.80 --> 1157.84]  a sudden i realized the gospel is so much bigger than i often thought it was and i can only speak
[1157.84 --> 1162.56]  personally but let me just say how i've kind of come around on this i realized quickly as i read
[1162.56 --> 1167.76]  the story of the bible and god's concern for his world that the gospel is about more than just individual
[1167.76 --> 1174.40]  forgiveness beautiful though that is i never tire of coming to worship and receiving the grace of christ
[1174.40 --> 1178.64]  through the preaching through prayer and through singing i celebrate that we are forgiven as god's
[1178.64 --> 1183.68]  people but the gospel is about more than that it's about more than just god in jesus defeating the
[1183.68 --> 1191.76]  tempting power of satan amazing though that is and the gospel is about more than just him overpowering death
[1192.88 --> 1200.88]  the gospel is about jesus bringing resurrection to the world it's about jesus coming to his world that is
[1200.88 --> 1208.80]  marred by sin and saying i have been sent by my father to make all things new and he says exactly
[1208.80 --> 1214.64]  that in matthew 19 and the apostles in writing acts say the exact same thing about jesus mission he has
[1214.64 --> 1222.88]  come to make all things new you know two quotes that come to mind one uh this is a very easy to remember
[1222.88 --> 1227.52]  one but a teacher of mine back in the day said you know god don't make junk he's talking about the
[1227.52 --> 1234.80]  creation and god don't junk what he makes and through jesus he restores his world and we will
[1234.80 --> 1240.00]  see the renewal at the end when jesus returns the other person is chris wright and i'm going to
[1240.00 --> 1244.48]  paraphrase here because i don't have an exact quote he says the goal of god in sending jesus is not to
[1244.48 --> 1250.80]  clean us up and then bring us out of the world the goal of god in jesus is to clean up the whole creation
[1250.80 --> 1261.28]  including us so that he can come and dwell with us here forever good news when i was a youth pastor
[1261.28 --> 1265.36]  i spent a lot of time teaching the story of the bible in fact some of you here were my youth and i just
[1265.36 --> 1270.72]  feel sad that you had to listen to this dave grew and droning on and on about this but i remember just
[1270.72 --> 1275.20]  listening to you struggle with what the bible is about trying to make sense of this long story and i
[1275.20 --> 1282.32]  remember those moments of just like ah you mean to say that my life in this world is what god wants
[1282.32 --> 1287.36]  me to live you mean to say that my body matters and that my body matters enough to jesus i'm going to
[1287.36 --> 1293.44]  rise to life again and enjoy the things i love in this world you mean to say that the home i live in the
[1293.44 --> 1299.04]  relationships i have all the stuff that's actually good in this world we get to enjoy forever and the
[1299.04 --> 1307.60]  answer is yes god's ultimate plan is to bring resurrection to this world and resurrection to our
[1307.60 --> 1314.48]  physical body so that we can enjoy this beautiful creation as we are intended to from the beginning that is
[1314.48 --> 1324.48]  good news that story transforms the generations of the generation of a god who has the power to make all things new
[1324.48 --> 1332.40]  now i'm going to finish with the danger with this too we will come back to in this series the danger
[1332.40 --> 1338.80]  is that every generation of christians faces the temptation to number one neglect and then forget
[1338.80 --> 1344.24]  this story to let dust cover their bibles and not really know what it's about get confused by it and
[1344.24 --> 1348.88]  just leave it alone you know watch some more netflix it's not that important blah blah blah and then what
[1348.88 --> 1354.16]  happens is another story and trust me we all are shaped by some story whether we know it or not
[1354.16 --> 1359.44]  another story comes in and shapes our lives or then co-ops the biblical story and we get some weird
[1359.44 --> 1365.12]  messed up fusing of the biblical story with our cultural story that is what happens by the way
[1365.12 --> 1370.96]  in corinthians when paul writes to this church they are like full of the spirit they are loving this power
[1370.96 --> 1375.36]  they have they're speaking in tongues they're doing all sorts of prophecy and paul saying to them
[1375.36 --> 1379.76]  you've got division between the wealthy and the poor you are obsessed with the elite with the
[1379.76 --> 1385.68]  philosophers all these big ideas you are so shaped by the corinth story and you are not living according
[1385.68 --> 1390.80]  to the scriptures and he's saying to them you need to learn church how to live according to the
[1390.80 --> 1398.88]  scriptures and the same is true today i don't think i need to talk about the challenges we all face in
[1398.88 --> 1405.92]  neglecting the biblical story reading it saturating it learning from it rooting our lives in it but we also
[1405.92 --> 1411.60]  need to take seriously how there's another story in our own culture that is shaping our hearts our
[1411.60 --> 1417.92]  ambitions our future plans and shaping our minds in a way that is not in tune with the biblical story
[1419.36 --> 1423.52]  let me give you a very poignant example of that there's a scholar by the name of christian
[1424.40 --> 1430.40]  a number of years ago he did a study with 3 000 american teenagers most of whom were christian
[1430.96 --> 1435.12]  and what he wanted to know is how do these teenagers articulate their faith like what is it that
[1435.12 --> 1439.28]  they say when they have to summarize what they believe about the world their deepest convictions
[1439.28 --> 1444.64]  about life and he compiled all their answers into this document which then got turned into a book
[1444.64 --> 1450.64]  and what he concluded was this these christians or sorry these teenagers are saying things that are
[1450.64 --> 1457.20]  actually very much not in sync with christianity and he said it's actually not christianity he said
[1457.20 --> 1463.44]  what i'm hearing from them is he coined this category it's moralistic therapeutic deism
[1463.44 --> 1471.60]  moralistic therapeutic deism and i'll summarize it to you as follows most of the teens expressed a
[1471.60 --> 1477.28]  sense of god exists he created this world and he watches over it in some way god wants people to be
[1477.28 --> 1483.68]  good nice and fair to each other as taught in the bible and in other world religions the central goal of
[1483.68 --> 1491.36]  life is to be happy and feel good about oneself god does not need to be particularly involved in one's life
[1491.36 --> 1497.44]  except when we need him and then he comes in to resolve our problems good people go to heaven when
[1497.44 --> 1503.68]  they die that's the summary of moralistic therapeutic deism now there's insights in there i don't want to
[1503.68 --> 1512.56]  be trashing this but christian smith goes on to say is this what the bible teaches is the goal of life to
[1512.56 --> 1520.88]  feel good about oneself and then he goes on to ask well what's missing from moralistic therapeutic deism
[1520.88 --> 1531.92]  you know what's missing sin sin is missing you know what else is missing the gospel jesus is missing from
[1531.92 --> 1537.28]  moralistic therapeutic deism and he says what if we help people understand to move beyond this to say
[1537.28 --> 1542.48]  there actually is a god who's come in christ and the deepest needs of our heart the deepest distortions
[1542.48 --> 1547.04]  in our hearts he's come to deal with and not only that he's come to heal the whole creation
[1548.48 --> 1553.28]  and i think all of us in some way have been affected by that moralistic therapeutic deism
[1553.28 --> 1557.44]  where we think of christianity as god sort of doing what we need him to do so we can feel good about
[1557.44 --> 1561.68]  ourselves and the story of the bible is about much more than that
[1564.88 --> 1572.16]  in first corinthians 15 paul says to a church that has got its own brokenness he says this is the gospel
[1572.48 --> 1578.00]  and to the church today he says this is the gospel that christ died according to the scriptures he was
[1578.00 --> 1584.24]  buried raised to life according to the scriptures and he appeared and the only way we can understand
[1584.24 --> 1589.60]  what that means is the story and in the middle of that story comes this jewish man who says the kingdom
[1589.60 --> 1596.48]  of god is near i have come to overturn the power of death i've come to stand against this tempting power
[1596.48 --> 1606.24]  of satan and i have come to forgive sin and the invitation to every single person then and now
[1607.36 --> 1616.16]  is to repent and believe to turn away from the false gospels to turn away from the false stories and say
[1616.16 --> 1623.76]  jesus i believe that you died and that you rose that salvation forgiveness freedom and the cosmic renewal of
[1623.76 --> 1632.24]  this world is real because of you and we are invited to turn in our own lives to receive that good news
[1632.24 --> 1640.80]  and to take our stand i want to finish with the words that jesus himself gives about his resurrection
[1640.80 --> 1647.44]  in john chapter 11. to people grieving their friend's death jesus says i am the resurrection and the life
[1647.44 --> 1653.36]  the one who believes in me will live even though they die and whoever lives by believing in me will
[1653.36 --> 1662.72]  never die and he finishes with this question i'll ask it to us as a church do you believe this good news
[1664.24 --> 1665.28]  let me lead us in prayer
[1665.28 --> 1678.40]  father we believe help us in our unbelief
[1681.52 --> 1684.64]  we ask that you would reveal to us the gospel
[1686.16 --> 1692.08]  that you would strip out of our hearts and our lives all the false gods and the false stories that we live
[1692.08 --> 1700.88]  out of and help us see that jesus christ is life would you fill us with hope that because the tomb is
[1700.88 --> 1706.48]  empty the future is secure would you fill us with confidence that when we take our stand on the gospel
[1706.48 --> 1714.40]  we have stood on something secure we thank you for salvation we thank you for the forgiveness of sins
[1714.40 --> 1723.12]  we thank you that satan has been defeated and we thank you that death is not the end praise you jesus
[1723.12 --> 1728.40]  for what you have finished fill us with your spirit amen
