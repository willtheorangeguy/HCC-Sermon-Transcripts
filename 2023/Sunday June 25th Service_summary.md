• Volunteer Appreciation Sunday and the importance of serving others
• The power of prayer and praying for those in need
• The fourth Beatitude: "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness"
• Paraphrasing the Beatitude to make it more relatable
• Desperation vs simple craving, using the example of a hiker stuck between boulders in the movie 127 Hours
• Sharing God's heart through having a deep desire for righteousness (shalom relationship)
• Restoring that deep desire through God's grace and the Holy Spirit
• Shalom relationship as the core meaning of desiring righteousness
• Jesus' blessing on the meek and humble goes against human nature
• The gospel reveals that awareness of sin leads to a desire for restoration and sharing God's heart
• Shalom is a key word representing a restored, harmonious relationship with God
• Righteousness encompasses justice, harmony, love, and purity in relationships
• Jesus' Sermon on the Mount emphasizes the need for righteousness surpassing that of the Pharisees
• The Pharisees and Jewish leaders misunderstood righteousness as an external behavior rather than an internal attitude of heart
• In contrast, God desires a shalom relationship with humanity.
• The Pharisees and teachers of the law missed the mark by focusing on the letter of the law rather than the heart of God
• The biblical concept of "missing the mark" is known as hamartia, meaning to miss the target or standard
• Religious checklists and a focus on sacrifice rather than relationship with God are not what God desires
• Shalom, or wholeness and restoration, is at the heart of righteousness and is a relational concept between God and His people
• The Ten Commandments are a picture of this shalom relationship brought about by God's work of salvation
• There are fourfold relationships that are broken: with God, others, oneself, and creation
• Righteousness is not just about keeping laws or codes, but about living in harmony and relationship with God and others
• Idolatry and other sinful behaviors lead to broken relationships
• Scripture teaches us about sin and brokenness, but also offers hope in restoration through Christ
• The Holy Spirit empowers believers to exhibit the fruit of love, joy, peace, and self-control
• Serving one another is a natural expression of these fruits, not just a requirement to be righteous
• A church that embodies these qualities can be a light to the community and serve the world
• The preacher discusses the challenge of living out one's faith
• A church is made up of broken sinners who struggle with relationships and restoration
• The encouragement is to pray for God's guidance through Scripture and crave righteousness
• Christ has won victory over sin, death, and brokenness, and it is a done deal
• The goal is to reflect this finished mission in everyday life as a church community
