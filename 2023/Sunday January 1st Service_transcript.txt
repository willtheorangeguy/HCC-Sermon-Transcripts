[0.00 --> 9.26]  Can I have the instruments playing during my sermon too?
[12.92 --> 18.08]  Now with all the music gone, it's going to be hard to focus on just my words and my voice,
[18.24 --> 19.38]  but I'll try my best.
[20.32 --> 22.00]  Good morning, Hope, and Happy New Year.
[22.48 --> 23.26]  Happy New Year.
[23.98 --> 30.96]  I'm so excited, and it is such a great privilege that I get to witness to God's Word with you
[30.96 --> 33.10]  in this first Sunday of this new year.
[33.70 --> 41.06]  Usually in Korean tradition, Korean churches, they don't let the newbie pastor preach the first sermon of a new year.
[41.44 --> 43.96]  It's a great privilege, and I do not take it lightly.
[44.30 --> 48.72]  I will try my best to not ruin the whole year, but no promises.
[49.34 --> 51.18]  I let God work my words.
[51.18 --> 52.46]  We'll see how it goes.
[53.26 --> 59.58]  And so this morning, in light of our recent memories that we looked at in our Advent and Christmas season,
[59.96 --> 62.62]  we were reminded of the fulfillment of the gospel.
[63.36 --> 65.30]  I just want to say one more time, Emmanuel.
[66.38 --> 70.26]  God came to dwell with us as was prophesied in the Old Testament.
[70.92 --> 73.90]  And so we'll go straight into the text that we have this morning with us.
[73.90 --> 79.00]  So if you have your Bibles with you, please turn with me to Matthew chapter 4.
[79.00 --> 84.42]  Matthew chapter 4, and we're going to begin to read in verse 17.
[84.42 --> 94.12]  And so as the prophecy is fulfilled with the coming of Jesus,
[94.52 --> 98.02]  from that time on, Jesus began to preach.
[98.82 --> 101.74]  Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.
[101.74 --> 109.82]  And as Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew.
[110.46 --> 113.06]  They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
[114.06 --> 114.60]  Jesus said,
[114.60 --> 118.58]  Come, follow me, and I will send you out to fish for people.
[119.28 --> 121.56]  At once they left their nets and followed him.
[122.20 --> 126.42]  Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
[126.74 --> 129.46]  They were in a boat with their father, preparing their nets.
[129.90 --> 134.46]  Jesus called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
[134.46 --> 141.82]  Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom,
[142.22 --> 146.94]  and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
[147.80 --> 148.10]  Amen.
[148.78 --> 150.36]  This is God's kingdom.
[151.96 --> 157.52]  As we just read our passage this morning for this new year, it's about God's kingdom.
[158.66 --> 162.58]  You may hear this, or at least this idea from me a lot today.
[162.58 --> 164.76]  The already, not yet.
[165.54 --> 171.66]  This phrase that many scholars use to describe is used to describe God's kingdom on earth.
[172.58 --> 178.92]  And as I was preparing for today's sermon, an illustration came to mind, which takes place in Korean history, actually.
[179.56 --> 185.92]  Now, I didn't take a lot of, take a lot of, I didn't have the opportunity to study a lot of Korean history growing up,
[185.96 --> 187.02]  because I grew up here in Canada.
[187.54 --> 189.72]  But, that's why we have movies.
[189.72 --> 196.84]  And, one of the movies portrayed a significant part of Korea's history during the Japanese occupation.
[197.68 --> 203.90]  And in the 1900s, the Japanese empire at the time succeeded in taking control of the Korean peninsula,
[204.26 --> 206.46]  which was back then what just one kingdom.
[206.86 --> 209.74]  It wasn't North Korea, South Korea, two countries.
[209.84 --> 211.38]  It was one kingdom, actually.
[211.78 --> 213.90]  We actually had a monarchy.
[213.90 --> 220.82]  And during this time, some of the main leaders of the independence movement of Korea set up a provisional,
[221.36 --> 223.36]  a temporary government in China.
[223.52 --> 224.26]  So, they ran away.
[224.60 --> 229.30]  They set up a secret government where the main leaders got together.
[229.30 --> 237.16]  And so, in reality, the official capital of Korea was still in what we called Seoul,
[238.04 --> 240.56]  under the control of the Japanese empire at the time.
[241.32 --> 250.22]  But one could say that the real capital of Korea, its kingdom, was centered where the leaders set up base.
[250.22 --> 257.66]  It was hidden, it was secret, but it was real and existed wherever those leaders were.
[259.04 --> 265.36]  And so, I think this serves as a very good illustration of God's kingdom that was inaugurated, is the term we use.
[265.70 --> 268.32]  Inbreaking of God's kingdom by the coming of Jesus Christ.
[269.42 --> 274.46]  Jesus announces at the beginning of his ministry on earth, that we read today,
[274.46 --> 278.84]  that the kingdom of God is near, is at hand.
[279.88 --> 287.78]  The prophecy that we looked at during Advent in Isaiah is fulfilled with Christ coming in the flesh to dwell with us.
[288.64 --> 291.96]  The king has come, and he lives with us.
[292.54 --> 299.22]  And so, wherever the ruler is, wherever the true king is, that's where the kingdom is.
[299.74 --> 300.68]  Do you believe this?
[300.68 --> 310.40]  And for us, living in this biblical story, we are at the period of history where God dwells with us by his Holy Spirit.
[311.42 --> 318.18]  We are called the church, God's people, in two words, two key words that I want to highlight here.
[318.72 --> 327.40]  We are God's people, representing his kingdom as a gathered people, and also as a sent people, representing his kingdom on earth.
[327.40 --> 337.38]  And so, going back to our Matthew text this morning, do you see what Jesus starts with as he makes this proclamation of God's kingdom coming on earth?
[338.24 --> 342.82]  He says, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.
[343.84 --> 344.40]  Repent.
[345.16 --> 346.36]  And that's what he starts with.
[347.42 --> 348.02]  Repentance.
[348.02 --> 357.98]  And so, as I was preparing for the sermon, I had to stop and ask myself at this point, why does Jesus start with repentance?
[358.38 --> 359.38]  A call to repentance.
[360.14 --> 362.56]  What's the actual meaning of repentance anyways?
[364.16 --> 369.24]  And as always, I like to go back to the original languages and to see what that nuance holds.
[369.24 --> 374.90]  And the Greek word for repenting, the verb, is metanoeo.
[375.98 --> 376.58]  Metanoeo.
[377.28 --> 382.56]  This is the verb meaning, actually, to change one's mind or purpose.
[383.36 --> 386.50]  We could even say that it is to change one's will.
[388.12 --> 394.46]  When I was growing up, when I heard the word repentance, all I could think about was the idea of forgiveness,
[394.70 --> 397.78]  asking God for forgiveness, which is correct in some way.
[397.78 --> 402.48]  But it is also to change one's mind.
[403.48 --> 407.86]  And in our biblical sense, that word repentance holds so much weight,
[408.12 --> 414.52]  because it is to change one's mind, to conform to God's will, God's kingdom.
[416.54 --> 420.70]  And I feel like I've quoted Romans 12, every single sermon that I've done here at Hope.
[421.00 --> 423.96]  But I do feel like it should be quoted here.
[423.96 --> 428.88]  Because in Romans 12, 4, it says that, Paul says,
[429.38 --> 435.06]  do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[435.46 --> 438.04]  By the renewing of your mind.
[439.14 --> 439.86]  Repentance.
[439.86 --> 450.48]  And also notice, this call to repentance here, according to Paul, is both active and passive.
[451.76 --> 457.54]  It is a call to actively participate in God's kingdom life on earth by repenting,
[457.82 --> 462.82]  meaning by renewing our minds and conforming to God's will, not our own.
[463.36 --> 464.64]  So active participation.
[464.64 --> 473.08]  It is also passive, in the sense that it is Jesus himself, God himself calling his people.
[474.04 --> 479.20]  He's not just any teacher or prophet, but he is Lord.
[480.04 --> 484.80]  And this Lord calls us and renews us by his grace and love.
[485.96 --> 488.00]  Be transformed, Paul says.
[488.00 --> 497.14]  The good news here about God's exhortation for us is that we are never left on our own.
[498.36 --> 504.20]  And I shudder to even think what God's kingdom on earth would look like if we were left on our own.
[504.36 --> 509.86]  To try and reflect his kingdom by our own wills and our own powers.
[509.86 --> 520.90]  But God, by his Holy Spirit, says that he renews us and he equips us to live his kingdom on earth.
[521.72 --> 525.60]  It is his kingdom and it is his ministry that we participate in.
[527.66 --> 534.28]  And so witness today how Jesus himself, who initiates the calling for discipleship,
[534.28 --> 537.04]  and notice his posture of humility.
[537.92 --> 542.34]  He doesn't just sit on a throne and just demands that his people come to him.
[543.16 --> 550.32]  Jesus, in his humility and servant leadership, actually goes out and calls his disciples himself.
[551.80 --> 557.32]  And so it is significant that Jesus, being the rightful king and lord over all creation,
[557.76 --> 563.34]  doesn't just distance himself from us and just waits for us to come to him.
[563.34 --> 565.74]  But he actually comes to us.
[566.38 --> 569.24]  He initiates the calling for discipleship.
[570.36 --> 573.88]  In the Gospel of John, we read how Jesus says to his disciples,
[574.86 --> 578.78]  You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.
[579.72 --> 582.58]  And also, it's not on the screen, but remember what he says here.
[582.82 --> 586.66]  The point is that you can do nothing apart from me.
[587.24 --> 590.74]  Abide in me because you can't do anything without Jesus.
[590.74 --> 594.74]  Also in 1 John, one of my favorite verses,
[595.76 --> 599.56]  We love our active participation in God's kingdom.
[599.88 --> 602.70]  We love, we love others, we love one another.
[603.66 --> 608.16]  But it is only because he, God, first loved us.
[608.60 --> 610.74]  Our passive reception of God's grace.
[610.74 --> 620.12]  In Matthew's text that we looked at, in verse 18, it says that Jesus, as he was walking by the Sea of Galilee,
[620.58 --> 624.38]  he is the one, like I said, who initiates the call to discipleship.
[624.82 --> 626.44]  He says to Peter and John,
[626.98 --> 627.88]  Come, follow me.
[629.20 --> 632.26]  And you see, in the rabbinic culture of Jesus' day,
[632.34 --> 633.54]  so a little bit of history here,
[633.54 --> 638.24]  It was common for the rabbis, so the teachers, to have many disciples.
[638.36 --> 639.58]  That was a very common thing.
[639.80 --> 642.18]  It wasn't only Jesus that had a big following.
[643.42 --> 647.40]  But the difference was, was that usually it was common for the disciples,
[647.64 --> 654.06]  the potential students, to go out and seek potential or prominent famous teachers, rabbis,
[654.16 --> 655.00]  to ask them,
[655.24 --> 656.26]  Can I be your student?
[657.00 --> 658.26]  May I follow you?
[658.68 --> 660.48]  Can you be my teacher?
[660.84 --> 661.44]  My Lord?
[661.44 --> 669.52]  But here with Jesus, it is significant that it isn't the disciples who go out and find Jesus.
[670.26 --> 672.06]  Jesus goes out and finds them.
[674.10 --> 678.10]  In other words, no one comes to the Lord by their own initiative.
[678.90 --> 680.66]  The Lord comes to them first.
[681.94 --> 684.02]  And I believe this is our calling as well.
[684.82 --> 687.66]  God calls us to be his disciples.
[688.66 --> 691.34]  This is our kingdom people identity.
[692.42 --> 693.82]  And if you're new to the church,
[694.32 --> 700.64]  I hope you can see this discipleship identity that's reflected here among ourselves and our church.
[701.32 --> 708.18]  We reflected in 2022 of all the blessings that God has blessed us with to be a blessing for the community.
[708.18 --> 715.78]  An impactful, an impactful sermon series that I remember from a couple years now.
[716.08 --> 718.56]  I can say a couple years now because it's 2023.
[719.52 --> 723.96]  One of the sermon series that we did was called Apprenticing with Jesus.
[724.34 --> 726.08]  I don't know if anyone else can remember this.
[726.30 --> 727.58]  It was very impactful for me.
[728.64 --> 731.06]  We reflected on our call to discipleship,
[731.06 --> 734.24]  which is not just a simple teacher-student relationship.
[735.44 --> 738.06]  To focus on this calling just a little bit more,
[738.80 --> 744.30]  remember that a call to discipleship means doing our best to fully imitate,
[744.30 --> 747.62]  to follow and to fully mirror.
[747.62 --> 750.24]  And we even said, I remember this imagery,
[750.52 --> 754.52]  to follow in the dust of because we're following so close to our teacher.
[754.52 --> 761.56]  And a good quote that expresses this idea comes from a commentator named Dale Bruner.
[761.84 --> 762.32]  He says,
[762.84 --> 765.12]  Students lived with their rabbis.
[766.00 --> 768.22]  They did not merely hear their lectures.
[768.94 --> 772.02]  Discipleship was a study in residence.
[772.60 --> 773.84]  Homeschooling, you can say.
[774.56 --> 777.88]  It was a live-in arrangement with a teacher.
[779.16 --> 781.50]  Live-in relationship.
[781.50 --> 781.70]  Discipleship.
[782.90 --> 785.26]  Anyone else see Emmanuel here?
[786.28 --> 787.34]  God with us.
[787.66 --> 789.12]  God dwelling with us.
[790.38 --> 793.94]  Our Lord Jesus, who calls us to discipleship,
[794.32 --> 797.08]  forming a relationship and living with us.
[798.34 --> 799.78]  Being a disciple.
[800.42 --> 801.86]  Being Christ followers.
[802.98 --> 803.94]  Being a Christian.
[804.94 --> 806.86]  That's why we're called Christian, yeah.
[808.28 --> 811.48]  And so let's take a step back and go back to the beginning verse again.
[812.26 --> 817.50]  Remember, Jesus proclaims the beginning of God's kingdom with a call to repentance.
[817.98 --> 820.62]  Changing one's mind to conform to God's will,
[820.96 --> 823.06]  not our own sinful broken wills.
[823.66 --> 824.30]  God's will.
[824.90 --> 825.78]  In this proclamation,
[826.04 --> 828.18]  Repent for the kingdom of heaven.
[828.44 --> 830.72]  The kingdom of God is near.
[832.20 --> 836.08]  Many other translations actually translate this part as,
[836.32 --> 839.34]  The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[839.34 --> 840.50]  It is here.
[841.70 --> 843.88]  This signifies that God's kingdom,
[844.24 --> 846.12]  Through the coming of the incarnate deity,
[846.56 --> 848.06]  In Jesus Christ our Lord,
[848.40 --> 850.14]  This kingdom is at hand.
[850.34 --> 852.48]  It is both here, right now,
[852.64 --> 855.62]  And shall come when Jesus comes back again.
[855.62 --> 858.82]  That's why we say the phrase,
[859.36 --> 859.90]  Already,
[860.58 --> 861.40]  But not yet.
[864.90 --> 866.50]  And if you're new to our church,
[866.58 --> 868.48]  This might be a little bit unfamiliar to you,
[869.04 --> 870.56]  But here at our church,
[870.70 --> 873.68]  We see this story of the Bible eras a lot.
[874.24 --> 874.98]  I made it better.
[875.62 --> 876.88]  It looks prettier than Dave's.
[876.88 --> 877.18]  I just,
[877.26 --> 877.94]  I have to say.
[877.94 --> 882.02]  I believe the point,
[882.12 --> 882.36]  Yes.
[882.80 --> 883.26]  And so,
[883.86 --> 885.74]  Won't go through the whole story,
[885.94 --> 886.72]  But here,
[887.20 --> 888.46]  In the period of the church,
[889.04 --> 890.86]  Where some people like to call it,
[891.06 --> 892.48]  A period of ingathering,
[892.64 --> 893.60]  Where we're sent,
[893.98 --> 895.24]  To gather God's people,
[895.56 --> 897.12]  To know the gospel of Jesus,
[897.66 --> 898.66]  And God's kingdom.
[899.52 --> 900.58]  And here at the end,
[900.68 --> 902.00]  Is the full restoration.
[902.64 --> 904.34]  That's the not yet part.
[904.34 --> 905.86]  And for us,
[906.18 --> 907.48]  Redemption has begun,
[907.56 --> 909.22]  Because Jesus has already come.
[909.70 --> 910.30]  At Christmas,
[910.50 --> 911.32]  We reflected on.
[912.14 --> 913.38]  And in our biblical story,
[913.44 --> 914.20]  That we're living in,
[914.40 --> 916.24]  Equipped by the Holy Spirit,
[916.96 --> 918.12]  We are living in,
[918.30 --> 919.86]  A time of the church,
[920.12 --> 921.52]  Where we're trying to reflect,
[921.68 --> 922.60]  This last arrow,
[922.86 --> 924.08]  The full restoration,
[924.58 --> 925.92]  But here and now.
[928.36 --> 929.84]  We are to live,
[930.02 --> 932.10]  As Jesus' disciples,
[932.10 --> 933.60]  In a broken world,
[933.60 --> 935.68]  Reflecting that not yet kingdom,
[935.98 --> 937.36]  To the already here and now.
[940.28 --> 941.62]  And Daryl Johnson,
[941.78 --> 943.00]  A former professor at Regent,
[943.84 --> 944.68]  He wrote a book,
[944.84 --> 946.48]  On the Lord's prayer actually.
[946.98 --> 947.70]  And this is something,
[947.84 --> 948.60]  That our young adults,
[949.16 --> 950.42]  Have something to look forward to.
[950.52 --> 950.94]  This is,
[951.10 --> 951.84]  I'm planning to be,
[951.90 --> 952.98]  A book study on this one.
[953.82 --> 954.60]  And he says,
[954.70 --> 956.22]  Specifically when it comes to the part,
[956.60 --> 957.52]  Your kingdom come,
[957.96 --> 958.84]  Your will be done,
[958.88 --> 960.60]  On earth as it is in heaven.
[960.60 --> 962.98]  And he says,
[962.98 --> 964.58]  That when we pray,
[964.58 --> 965.72]  This part of the prayer,
[966.50 --> 968.58]  We're asking for something extraordinary.
[969.94 --> 971.08]  He says it well,
[971.20 --> 972.76]  That when Jesus says this,
[973.30 --> 974.18]  And when Jesus says,
[974.32 --> 975.22]  That the kingdom of God,
[975.30 --> 975.92]  Is at hand,
[976.16 --> 977.00]  Already here,
[977.60 --> 979.10]  It is not just the idea,
[979.22 --> 981.08]  Of a partial fulfillment now,
[981.28 --> 982.86]  And then a full fulfillment,
[983.04 --> 983.88]  When he comes back.
[983.88 --> 986.24]  The idea actually,
[986.32 --> 987.62]  Should be thought of as,
[987.98 --> 988.86]  It's fully here,
[989.18 --> 989.90]  But it's hidden,
[990.14 --> 990.92]  And it's veiled.
[992.22 --> 993.12]  And our job,
[993.30 --> 993.96]  And our prayer,
[994.10 --> 994.98]  And our desire,
[995.34 --> 996.16]  As a church,
[996.72 --> 998.02]  And as individual Christians,
[998.28 --> 999.00]  As disciples,
[999.54 --> 1001.28]  Is to reveal more and more,
[1001.36 --> 1002.98]  Of that hidden kingdom,
[1003.76 --> 1005.38]  On earth as it is in heaven.
[1006.66 --> 1008.16]  And so this part of the Lord's prayer,
[1008.68 --> 1009.58]  Dr. Johnson says,
[1009.66 --> 1010.56]  Can sound like this,
[1011.50 --> 1012.36]  Living God,
[1012.36 --> 1015.24]  Even before the day of the Lord,
[1016.08 --> 1017.64]  Reveal what is invisible,
[1018.50 --> 1019.98]  Manifest what is hidden.
[1023.46 --> 1024.74]  And so we stop,
[1025.02 --> 1025.60]  Take a breath,
[1026.06 --> 1026.78]  And we think about,
[1027.34 --> 1028.66]  How we can practically,
[1028.92 --> 1030.14]  Apply this to our lives,
[1030.22 --> 1030.66]  Here and now.
[1032.02 --> 1034.28]  What does kingdom on earth look like?
[1035.82 --> 1036.82]  Has anyone,
[1037.30 --> 1038.40]  Has any human being,
[1038.50 --> 1039.26]  Ever lived,
[1040.26 --> 1041.40]  This kingdom on earth,
[1041.40 --> 1042.42]  That we know of?
[1043.22 --> 1044.86]  Do we have a perfect example,
[1044.86 --> 1045.72]  That we can follow?
[1047.16 --> 1048.70]  And what's the Sunday school answer?
[1049.58 --> 1050.74]  It's always Jesus.
[1051.32 --> 1052.14]  You say anything,
[1052.46 --> 1053.20]  You ask anything,
[1053.28 --> 1053.78]  You just say,
[1054.14 --> 1054.36]  Jesus,
[1054.54 --> 1055.78]  And it's probably the right answer.
[1058.12 --> 1059.12]  Verse 23,
[1060.06 --> 1060.44]  Today,
[1061.00 --> 1061.76]  Matthew 4,
[1062.22 --> 1062.72]  Says that,
[1062.72 --> 1065.38]  Jesus went through Galilee,
[1065.90 --> 1067.14]  Teaching in their synagogues,
[1067.40 --> 1068.96]  Proclaiming the good news of the kingdom,
[1069.30 --> 1073.04]  And healing every disease and sickness among the people.
[1074.00 --> 1074.98]  So teaching,
[1075.48 --> 1075.90]  Preaching,
[1076.14 --> 1077.00]  And healing.
[1078.28 --> 1081.04]  Now there can be multiple interpretations of this,
[1081.44 --> 1083.52]  But one of the interpretations that I had,
[1084.02 --> 1085.14]  If I may suggest,
[1085.20 --> 1085.92]  You don't have to agree,
[1085.92 --> 1088.40]  But if we can think of,
[1088.50 --> 1090.36]  The teaching and preaching part,
[1090.66 --> 1092.80]  As internal ministries of the church,
[1093.20 --> 1094.92]  Proclaiming the good news of the kingdom,
[1095.14 --> 1097.00]  I know it's not confined to a building,
[1097.70 --> 1098.42]  But just think,
[1098.72 --> 1101.38]  If those are referring to internal ministries,
[1101.76 --> 1103.36]  Preaching and teaching about God's kingdom,
[1103.70 --> 1104.88]  The healing part,
[1105.48 --> 1107.86]  Speaks into our sent identity,
[1107.86 --> 1110.62]  To be a blessing for the world.
[1110.62 --> 1114.86]  Jesus' ministry of healing,
[1114.86 --> 1118.08]  Is the beginning of the revealing process,
[1118.30 --> 1119.82]  Of Revelation 21.
[1120.46 --> 1122.34]  That last arrow at the end.
[1123.58 --> 1126.06]  Where God fully restores creation,
[1126.48 --> 1127.80]  Where there are no more tears,
[1128.12 --> 1129.04]  No more death,
[1129.34 --> 1130.26]  No more mourning,
[1130.52 --> 1131.18]  Or pain.
[1132.24 --> 1134.58]  This is God's dwelling place.
[1135.08 --> 1136.40]  And we looked at during Advent,
[1136.70 --> 1138.58]  God starts with dwelling with us,
[1138.58 --> 1140.64]  God dwells with us,
[1140.64 --> 1142.46]  As he came in the form of Jesus,
[1142.96 --> 1145.46]  And he will dwell with us again.
[1146.62 --> 1148.72]  This is his kingdom already,
[1149.56 --> 1150.90]  But also not yet.
[1152.86 --> 1154.52]  A famous missiologist,
[1155.28 --> 1156.82]  By the name of Leslie Newbegin,
[1157.16 --> 1158.80]  He says this about kingdom living,
[1160.60 --> 1162.44]  Meaningful action in history,
[1162.92 --> 1165.72]  Is possible only when there is some vision of a future goal.
[1166.96 --> 1167.90]  I'll read that again.
[1168.58 --> 1170.66]  Meaningful action in history,
[1170.86 --> 1171.92]  The here and now,
[1172.82 --> 1176.90]  Is only possible when there is some vision of a future goal.
[1177.60 --> 1179.66]  And we have a future goal hope.
[1180.46 --> 1182.64]  Our future goal is the full restoration,
[1183.60 --> 1187.00]  The hope that we have only in Jesus our Lord.
[1187.00 --> 1191.10]  And so as we enter this new year,
[1191.32 --> 1193.76]  We are encouraged by God's word this morning.
[1194.28 --> 1196.00]  And that as Christians,
[1196.28 --> 1199.50]  We are called to participate in making visible,
[1199.90 --> 1202.80]  That hidden and invisible kingdom of God.
[1205.08 --> 1206.66]  Both as disciples,
[1207.28 --> 1209.10]  Meaning individual Christians,
[1209.10 --> 1211.38]  In our ordinary lives,
[1211.38 --> 1212.02]  In our ordinary lives,
[1212.30 --> 1214.52]  And also as the body of Christ,
[1214.86 --> 1216.32]  The distinct community,
[1216.32 --> 1218.14]  That lives counter-culturally,
[1218.14 --> 1219.82]  To the patterns of this world.
[1219.82 --> 1225.12]  So a few practical things,
[1225.12 --> 1226.32]  As we wrap up this morning.
[1227.84 --> 1229.20]  A few practical things,
[1229.20 --> 1230.50]  That I would highlight for us,
[1231.00 --> 1231.60]  As a church,
[1231.66 --> 1232.50]  And as individuals,
[1232.72 --> 1234.64]  As we live the kingdom life,
[1235.14 --> 1236.34]  In this new year as well.
[1237.64 --> 1238.44]  As a church,
[1238.50 --> 1239.84]  We are called to be a community,
[1240.20 --> 1242.28]  Of patience and steadfastness,
[1242.28 --> 1244.42]  In a world of instant gratification,
[1244.42 --> 1246.40]  And short attention spans.
[1248.08 --> 1249.36]  These are not my words.
[1249.64 --> 1250.90]  I'm sorry I don't have it up there.
[1253.74 --> 1255.20]  But in a world,
[1255.62 --> 1257.90]  Where everything is just so fast,
[1258.94 --> 1260.30]  That if you don't know anything,
[1260.50 --> 1262.06]  If you don't know anything,
[1262.16 --> 1263.48]  You're in trouble.
[1263.80 --> 1265.04]  But if you don't know something,
[1265.54 --> 1267.48]  All you need to do is pull out your phones,
[1267.54 --> 1268.30]  And Google it.
[1269.78 --> 1271.82]  And when it comes to something as serious,
[1271.82 --> 1273.94]  As our identity in Christ,
[1274.42 --> 1275.34]  Kingdom living.
[1275.82 --> 1277.18]  You can't just Google it.
[1277.78 --> 1279.74]  Google will not answer it for you.
[1280.00 --> 1281.44]  It's not an instant fix,
[1281.62 --> 1283.08]  Where you do this,
[1283.72 --> 1284.56]  Pastor Dave,
[1284.72 --> 1285.26]  Pastor Sid,
[1285.34 --> 1286.50]  Or Pastor Jonathan just says,
[1286.76 --> 1287.58]  Okay, from the Bible,
[1287.70 --> 1288.20]  It says this,
[1288.28 --> 1289.56]  Let's just try this this week.
[1290.08 --> 1291.32]  If we succeed,
[1291.58 --> 1292.74]  Then that's God's kingdom.
[1293.00 --> 1294.18]  We don't have to do anything more.
[1294.60 --> 1295.80]  Instantly, it's a fix.
[1297.64 --> 1298.90]  We are broken.
[1299.74 --> 1300.54]  We are sinners.
[1301.80 --> 1303.50]  And God says,
[1303.50 --> 1304.80]  That he will use us,
[1304.80 --> 1306.22]  And renew us.
[1306.22 --> 1308.82]  But this is a lifetime process.
[1309.94 --> 1311.02]  Who can say,
[1311.12 --> 1312.32]  No matter how old you are,
[1313.10 --> 1314.16]  Oh, I'm done now.
[1314.20 --> 1314.70]  I'm perfect.
[1315.24 --> 1317.80]  I am living my kingdom life,
[1317.90 --> 1319.16]  To the full potential.
[1319.16 --> 1326.16]  We need patience and steadfastness.
[1326.56 --> 1328.34]  And we need to rely on God,
[1328.64 --> 1331.08]  Who guides us as we live the kingdom life.
[1331.72 --> 1332.78]  And we also, I think,
[1332.84 --> 1336.56]  Need to be a community that submits to the authority of God,
[1337.08 --> 1339.04]  In a world of individual autonomy.
[1339.60 --> 1340.42]  I like that one.
[1340.42 --> 1344.70]  In our postmodern, we like to say,
[1345.18 --> 1346.46]  In the postmodern age,
[1347.64 --> 1349.12]  Everyone's opinion is right.
[1351.12 --> 1353.06]  If everyone's opinion is right,
[1353.32 --> 1354.44]  And opinions are conflicting,
[1355.40 --> 1356.26]  Who's right then?
[1357.12 --> 1358.84]  Where do we hold authority?
[1359.84 --> 1361.92]  Where do we have our reliance,
[1362.18 --> 1363.04]  Our foundation?
[1363.04 --> 1366.34]  I would say,
[1366.60 --> 1367.30]  I would suggest,
[1367.68 --> 1369.18]  That it is God's word.
[1370.56 --> 1371.36]  His word,
[1371.56 --> 1373.96]  His word given to us as a gift,
[1374.30 --> 1376.26]  Still holds authority for us.
[1377.80 --> 1379.70]  We also should be a community
[1379.70 --> 1381.60]  That reflects God's love
[1381.60 --> 1383.14]  By building one another up,
[1383.26 --> 1384.06]  Through scripture,
[1384.54 --> 1385.34]  Through prayer,
[1385.92 --> 1387.62]  Through healthy spiritual practices,
[1387.84 --> 1388.90]  Like daily devotions.
[1389.16 --> 1390.66]  Not tearing one another apart,
[1390.66 --> 1393.20]  Not trying to compete with one another,
[1393.38 --> 1395.08]  Just to climb that corporal ladder.
[1397.68 --> 1399.40]  And as individual Christians,
[1399.54 --> 1401.10]  As disciples for kingdom living,
[1401.36 --> 1402.14]  In our homes,
[1402.28 --> 1402.92]  With our friends,
[1403.04 --> 1403.58]  Our neighbors,
[1403.72 --> 1404.40]  And our families,
[1404.68 --> 1405.76]  In our workplaces,
[1405.90 --> 1408.14]  Where we spend so much of our energy and time,
[1408.62 --> 1410.44]  In our ordinary lives,
[1410.56 --> 1411.88]  Through word and deed,
[1412.54 --> 1414.12]  We reflect God's kingdom.
[1414.94 --> 1416.08]  And in one commentary,
[1416.08 --> 1420.20]  The commentator summarizes this,
[1420.66 --> 1421.46]  Discipleship,
[1421.94 --> 1422.80]  Kingdom living well.
[1423.76 --> 1424.80]  It's a longer quote,
[1424.94 --> 1425.98]  But I think it's worth reading.
[1427.94 --> 1429.00]  Whatever our profession,
[1429.80 --> 1431.30]  Whether preacher or plumber,
[1431.92 --> 1433.42]  Teacher or technician,
[1434.02 --> 1434.90]  Hotel maid,
[1435.34 --> 1436.54]  Or hospital orderly,
[1436.96 --> 1438.34]  Discipleship means,
[1438.72 --> 1441.40]  That we place as the priority of our lives,
[1441.80 --> 1442.86]  Joining with Jesus,
[1443.02 --> 1444.62]  In reaching our daily world,
[1444.62 --> 1446.38]  With the good news of life,
[1446.58 --> 1447.76]  In the kingdom of heaven.
[1448.08 --> 1448.92]  That's a mouthful.
[1448.92 --> 1451.94]  But whatever your profession,
[1452.24 --> 1453.42]  Wherever you are,
[1454.34 --> 1455.50]  And being a house parent,
[1455.70 --> 1456.56]  Is a profession.
[1459.44 --> 1461.54]  We reach our daily world,
[1461.66 --> 1462.70]  With the good news of life,
[1462.78 --> 1463.70]  In the kingdom of heaven.
[1464.26 --> 1465.10]  No pastor,
[1465.30 --> 1465.94]  As an example,
[1466.40 --> 1467.20]  No pastor,
[1467.64 --> 1469.30]  Can enter into the complex world,
[1469.38 --> 1470.62]  Of corporate finance,
[1470.88 --> 1471.66]  As effectively,
[1472.02 --> 1472.70]  As a committed,
[1472.90 --> 1473.52]  And knowledgeable,
[1473.84 --> 1475.24]  Christian business person.
[1475.24 --> 1476.92]  That was powerful for me.
[1477.36 --> 1478.58]  I have no knowledge,
[1478.68 --> 1479.36]  When it comes to money.
[1479.76 --> 1481.42]  Do not talk about numbers with me.
[1481.76 --> 1482.70]  It scares me.
[1483.76 --> 1484.92]  But that's why,
[1485.56 --> 1487.44]  We are all equipped together,
[1487.64 --> 1489.52]  To represent God's kingdom on earth.
[1490.10 --> 1490.96]  No pastor,
[1491.22 --> 1492.96]  Can enter into that field effectively.
[1493.96 --> 1495.44]  We have a privileged,
[1495.44 --> 1496.48]  Place of ministry,
[1496.78 --> 1497.58]  That is unique,
[1498.00 --> 1498.92]  To following Jesus,
[1499.12 --> 1500.24]  In our daily lives.
[1500.24 --> 1502.28]  That's why I love doing,
[1502.40 --> 1503.00]  The all of life,
[1503.22 --> 1503.70]  I do.
[1504.02 --> 1504.44]  The church,
[1504.66 --> 1505.50]  When we do,
[1505.62 --> 1506.62]  The all of life interviews,
[1506.96 --> 1507.80]  That's a reflection,
[1508.02 --> 1508.68]  Of the ministries,
[1508.78 --> 1509.52]  That we all have,
[1509.64 --> 1510.60]  In our daily lives.
[1512.46 --> 1513.42]  And so take,
[1513.50 --> 1514.48]  Encouragement hope.
[1515.22 --> 1516.44]  May this new year,
[1516.74 --> 1517.50]  Be a continuation,
[1518.06 --> 1519.24]  Or maybe perhaps,
[1519.32 --> 1519.82]  The beginning,
[1520.18 --> 1521.10]  Of our kingdom lives.
[1522.26 --> 1523.76]  May we as a church,
[1524.20 --> 1525.34]  Be a kingdom community,
[1525.58 --> 1526.48]  That is blessed,
[1526.48 --> 1528.52]  That is blessed,
[1528.66 --> 1530.36]  To be a blessing,
[1530.78 --> 1531.60]  That we keep saying.
[1532.68 --> 1533.16]  Remember,
[1533.50 --> 1534.86]  That we are not alone,
[1534.98 --> 1536.08]  In revealing this kingdom.
[1536.42 --> 1537.86]  It is God's Holy Spirit,
[1537.96 --> 1538.98]  Who dwells with us,
[1539.14 --> 1540.16]  Who equips us,
[1540.34 --> 1541.24]  Who guides us,
[1541.34 --> 1543.00]  For this kingdom living.
[1543.24 --> 1544.42]  It is his kingdom,
[1544.42 --> 1546.10]  It is his ministry,
[1546.46 --> 1548.10]  That we humbly participate in.
[1548.52 --> 1550.46]  And that is my prayer,
[1550.62 --> 1552.02]  And my blessing for everyone here,
[1552.12 --> 1552.56]  For us,
[1553.08 --> 1554.26]  As we enter this new year.
[1555.06 --> 1555.62]  Let's pray.
[1556.48 --> 1567.10]  Father God,
[1567.30 --> 1570.08]  We lift up,
[1570.32 --> 1571.98]  And we want to glorify you,
[1571.98 --> 1572.98]  In this new year.
[1575.02 --> 1575.54]  Lord,
[1575.58 --> 1576.70]  As we reflected back,
[1576.84 --> 1578.90]  In our last year's ministries,
[1579.38 --> 1581.40]  All we can say is,
[1581.82 --> 1582.04]  Thank you.
[1582.58 --> 1583.98]  Thank you for leading us.
[1584.14 --> 1585.62]  Thank you for being with us.
[1585.62 --> 1587.86]  Thank you for blessing us,
[1587.96 --> 1589.22]  And blessing our world.
[1590.58 --> 1592.30]  Thank you for choosing us,
[1592.62 --> 1593.96]  To be your sent people,
