• Introducing a new sermon series called "Your Story" with a focus on basics of Christianity and the Bible
• Explaining how the gospel is at the centre of the Christian faith, not just good advice or ideas
• Reading from 1 Corinthians 15:3-8, highlighting the importance of Christ's death and resurrection for salvation
• Using the example of a new parent receiving "good news" about their child to illustrate the concept of the gospel as good news
• Discussing how different denominations and individuals define the gospel in modern times
• Introducing a challenge to simplify the explanation of the Christian faith into a short summary or elevator pitch
• Importance of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection
• Christianity is based on an event (Jesus' resurrection) rather than just ideas or morals
• Need to wrestle with the testimony of witnesses (over 500 people who saw Jesus rise from the dead)
• Christian lives make sense within a story (Jesus' life and teachings as part of that story)
• Various narratives about Jesus exist, but only one makes sense: his life and death as fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies
• Importance of understanding Jesus in light of the Old Testament story
• The Bible presents a unified narrative from creation to perfection, with God's relationship with humanity as its central theme.
• Human sin and rebellion break this relationship, leading to corruption and injustice in the world.
• God works through history to restore his good creation, particularly through his relationship with Israel.
• Jesus Christ brings the "good news" of God's kingdom, which is near, and offers redemption from sin and its effects.
• Jesus' life on earth shows how the world is supposed to be, pointing towards a future where humanity will be healed, evil will be expelled, and there will be no poverty or hunger.
• The future will be a time of uncompromised worship, no marginalization, and the defeat of death and suffering
• Jesus' kingdom is where the future is going, with healed bodies, restored creation, forgiven lives, and cast-out demons
• The gospel is about more than individual forgiveness or defeating Satan; it's about Jesus bringing resurrection to the world
• God's goal in sending Jesus is not to clean up individuals but to restore his whole creation, including us
• The story of the Bible transforms generations by revealing that God has the power to make all things new
• Christians must be careful not to neglect or forget this story and instead let it shape their lives and worldviews.
• Discussion of "moralistic therapeutic deism" as a category coined by Christian Smith to describe a watered-down form of Christianity among teenagers
• Critique of moralistic therapeutic deism for lacking sin and the gospel in its teachings
• Explanation that true Christianity involves more than just feeling good about oneself, but also involves repentance, faith in Jesus Christ, and the forgiveness of sins
• Introduction of John 11 as a source to support the idea that believing in Jesus leads to eternal life and resurrection from death
• Invitation for the church to believe in the gospel and take their stand on it, with prayer and thanksgiving for salvation and the forgiveness of sins.
