[0.00 → 8.72] Good morning, Hope.
[10.56 → 14.46] It is my privilege to share with you God's Word this morning.
[14.98 → 15.74] Happy Thanksgiving.
[16.50 → 17.18] Happy Thanksgiving.
[18.36 → 21.46] Today we get to continue our series, Homegrown,
[22.18 → 27.46] where we continue to reflect and reflect about our discipleship
[27.46 → 29.22] that is happening in our homes.
[30.00 → 33.80] And so as we are going through the series of how that discipleship is happening,
[34.80 → 36.84] Dave asked early on in this series,
[37.50 → 41.76] we are sort of auditing our own homes to reflect,
[41.98 → 45.04] to think deeply about the discipleship, again, that's happening.
[45.40 → 47.54] And so I want to ask just at this point,
[48.12 → 50.34] how is the audit going for your homes?
[51.00 → 53.04] And through that audit, how do you feel?
[53.04 → 58.66] The hope is that you would feel challenged, convicted,
[59.20 → 62.68] but at the same time encouraged and comforted
[62.68 → 69.74] because the good news of our calling is that we are reflecting God's goodness in our homes.
[69.74 → 74.96] It's not of our own self-goodness or our own self-righteousness.
[75.32 → 79.70] It is the good news that we get to be more Christ-like in our homes.
[79.70 → 87.14] Not more Jonathan-like, not more Moon-like, but Christ-like in our very own homes.
[87.14 → 93.28] It's the power of God's Spirit living in us that guides and helps us as we are formed in our homes.
[94.20 → 96.30] And so I think this Thanksgiving morning,
[96.42 → 101.30] it's appropriate that we get to reflect and witness to God's Word on the theme of hospitality.
[101.30 → 105.02] And before I do get to the text for us today,
[105.20 → 108.66] I just want to stop and thanks, as I did in the 9 a.m. service,
[109.10 → 111.84] just our hospitality team that we have in our church,
[112.36 → 117.06] the servant, the seamanship, seamanship,
[117.30 → 122.10] the servant hearts that they reflect as they serve our church through the ministry of hospitality,
[122.26 → 127.54] I just want to take a moment and say thank you for being a part of the ministry of hospitality,
[127.98 → 130.94] reflecting God's love through our church ministry.
[130.94 → 133.46] And so thank you to the hospitality team.
[134.54 → 135.50] Yes, thank you.
[139.58 → 143.18] And so as we reflect on the theme of hospitality,
[143.34 → 144.96] I invite you, if you have your Bibles with you,
[145.02 → 148.28] if you have your apps, open up to Luke chapter 5.
[148.42 → 150.08] It'll be on the screen for you as well.
[150.92 → 153.52] And we witness to the Gospel of Luke this morning.
[156.14 → 158.04] We read from verse 27.
[158.04 → 162.78] After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector.
[163.64 → 166.92] Tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth.
[167.56 → 169.82] Follow me, Jesus said to him.
[171.70 → 174.48] And Levi got up, left everything, and followed him.
[175.16 → 178.82] Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house,
[178.82 → 183.64] and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.
[184.28 → 189.54] But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples.
[190.02 → 190.90] And they said to them,
[191.30 → 195.12] Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?
[196.04 → 197.20] Jesus answered them,
[197.20 → 198.20] Amen.
[198.20 → 200.30] It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
[200.86 → 206.22] I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
[207.76 → 208.20] Amen.
[208.38 → 209.60] That's good news for us.
[210.56 → 214.72] One of my favourite texts in the Bible about how Jesus has come for the sick,
[215.30 → 218.82] and one of the ironic and significant things that we need to be aware of is that
[218.82 → 222.50] you need to know that you are sick in order to seek a doctor.
[222.50 → 230.40] And so, in any case, about the theme of hospitality that we get to reflect and look at through this text this morning,
[231.30 → 235.52] I thought of an instance when I was around the age of seven,
[235.78 → 237.74] and that was the time when I was still in Korea.
[238.52 → 241.84] I had an instance where I was bullied by a classmate.
[242.88 → 245.08] My mom would cut my hair growing up,
[245.46 → 248.48] and during one of these cuts, there was an accident.
[248.48 → 253.82] She accidentally shaved a huge bald spot on the side of my head.
[254.84 → 256.24] Very noticeable, obviously.
[256.94 → 260.72] And unfortunately, that sort of cut was not trendy back then.
[262.26 → 263.38] It's never trendy.
[264.86 → 266.06] But during the...
[266.06 → 268.86] So, because I was embarrassed about the cut,
[269.00 → 273.52] I asked my mom to write a note for me to school to give permission to wear a hat.
[274.10 → 275.74] And so, that's what my teacher did.
[275.80 → 276.60] She gave me permission.
[276.60 → 282.16] But then try to get permission from the rest of my grade two classmates to wear a hat during class.
[282.52 → 284.10] How come you're the only one who gets to wear a hat?
[285.16 → 289.80] And so, during break time, one of the more rowdy friends in my class took off,
[289.90 → 292.74] took my hat away, and began to make fun of my new hairstyle.
[293.90 → 297.82] And it became a big deal to the point that my teacher actually called my mom
[297.82 → 300.12] to let her know what was happening with this particular friend.
[300.12 → 305.68] And after finding out, what my mom did after that was very significant
[305.68 → 308.54] and stuck with me all throughout these years.
[309.16 → 311.80] She got in contact with that friend's parents
[311.80 → 317.32] and asked if he could come over to our house, our home, to share a meal together.
[317.32 → 324.02] And I remember being very weirded out and sort of scared of what that meal might look like.
[324.84 → 330.92] But in our home, with my mom showing hospitality and love and care for this enemy,
[331.24 → 334.40] this friend, this bully, we ended up becoming great friends.
[334.68 → 336.76] And obviously, he stopped making fun of me at school.
[338.04 → 341.30] This kind of reminds you, maybe, of what Paul says in Romans.
[341.30 → 345.68] Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
[347.16 → 349.10] And this reflects the proverb also.
[349.26 → 350.14] Proverbs 17 says,
[350.42 → 354.56] Evil will never leave the house of one who pays back evil for good.
[355.82 → 358.68] And so, as cute and childish as this example is,
[359.08 → 363.06] what my mom did was, through love, through hospitality,
[363.96 → 368.66] overcame this conflict between two friends, between a relationship.
[368.66 → 372.06] And so, the good news for us today, simply put,
[372.40 → 378.60] is that this same loving hospitality is extended to us as God's family.
[379.66 → 385.28] We, we have broken sinners, are called into his family out of his mercy and love
[385.28 → 389.82] because in our sin, we were rebels, we were enemies of God,
[390.32 → 392.76] but he invited us into his own home.
[393.54 → 397.30] And just like Jesus invited Levi in our text that we looked at,
[397.30 → 399.64] the tax collector, and we'll get to that,
[400.74 → 403.92] he called him to follow him, to join with him in his family.
[404.72 → 407.80] And just like that sinner, the tax collector, was invited,
[408.24 → 410.78] so too are we invited into his family.
[411.60 → 415.38] Nothing that we have done ourselves to deserve this invitation.
[416.82 → 419.40] And so, just like Israel in the Old Testament,
[419.88 → 423.82] our mission as the church then is to receive that love,
[423.82 → 426.34] to be equipped by that love of hospitality,
[426.66 → 430.76] and extend that to others, whoever that other may be.
[432.14 → 433.70] And so, that's the image that we get.
[434.16 → 439.38] Jesus is inviting you into his banquet, his feast, the image that we get.
[440.06 → 443.34] And so, Jesus was and is inviting sinners,
[443.64 → 447.46] the lowly, the outcasts, the strangers, the foreigners,
[447.46 → 451.16] into his home so that redemption and restoration,
[451.74 → 455.42] so that real healing can happen, whatever that looks like.
[456.26 → 462.34] Jesus was not interested in just conforming to the religious and social patterns of his day.
[462.58 → 468.28] He did not simply eat and share life with the religiously fit or socially prestigious people.
[468.80 → 472.00] He calls anyone from all walks of life,
[472.00 → 475.16] whatever the sin we are going through.
[476.82 → 479.98] And so, this invitation, just like to the tax collector Levi,
[480.32 → 482.36] is a calling of repentance.
[483.10 → 485.66] It's not just simply a calling into his family,
[485.84 → 489.94] but it's a calling for restoration and healing through repentance,
[490.76 → 494.52] which just simply means to reorient our whole lives,
[494.78 → 499.70] 180-degree turn, to walk with Jesus and to do live with him.
[499.70 → 503.50] And to do live with him is a celebration.
[504.24 → 506.84] It's a feast, as you can see today in our Thanksgiving communion.
[507.36 → 508.02] It's a feast.
[508.26 → 508.82] It's a party.
[510.80 → 514.84] And so, to this party, Jesus invites a bunch of sinners.
[515.02 → 517.62] That's what his guest list looks like, if you want to put it that way.
[518.14 → 521.80] And then, now you have to compare to the guest list of the Pharisees
[521.80 → 523.88] and what their guest list looked like.
[523.88 → 531.92] Because for the Pharisees, they thought that ritual purity was required for you to make it onto that guest list.
[533.40 → 536.40] And so, for the Pharisees, who you shared a meal with,
[536.74 → 539.00] who you shared hospitality to,
[539.98 → 541.92] defined who you were, your whole identity,
[542.26 → 545.42] and defined your relationship with God.
[545.42 → 548.58] And so, as I was wrestling with the text,
[549.16 → 551.04] I stopped at this point and asked,
[551.86 → 555.04] where did the Pharisees and some of the Jews get this idea from?
[555.70 → 559.72] Why did they come up with a bunch of rules and laws and codes,
[560.06 → 560.88] purity codes,
[561.40 → 565.82] to be good enough to be admitted into God's people?
[566.30 → 567.98] Where did they get this idea from?
[568.88 → 570.68] And so, just a little bit of background here.
[570.68 → 574.06] If you take Surge, you get to go more in-depth into this,
[574.54 → 577.74] through a lot of reading and good information.
[578.28 → 580.74] And so, when God's chosen people, Israel,
[581.28 → 583.42] when they failed to be a light for the world,
[583.76 → 586.46] they were desperately awaiting a Messiah.
[587.74 → 591.84] God's chosen Saviour that would redeem them from Gentile,
[592.00 → 593.36] from foreign rule.
[593.66 → 596.24] And so, during Jesus' time, it was the Roman Empire.
[596.24 → 599.88] And so, their idea of God's kingdom being restored
[599.88 → 603.04] was to kick all people, all foreigners out.
[603.94 → 606.70] And from that is where they developed the purity codes.
[607.70 → 610.10] They wanted the glory of establishing God's kingdom
[610.10 → 611.74] in the land that was given to them,
[611.90 → 612.74] not the Romans.
[614.02 → 616.60] And so, out of that desire, different groups of Jews,
[616.76 → 620.16] we have different Jewish sects that developed during this time,
[620.24 → 622.02] during the intertestamental period.
[622.02 → 624.38] But specifically for the Pharisees,
[624.68 → 627.28] how they developed their idea was
[627.28 → 630.12] to take the interpretation of the kingdom vision
[630.12 → 633.74] and require strict dietary laws
[633.74 → 638.02] that were originally made for priests
[638.02 → 640.42] administering worship in the temple.
[641.26 → 643.76] So, they took that among a bunch of others,
[643.86 → 645.10] 613 of them,
[645.84 → 647.22] interpretations of the Torah,
[647.38 → 649.96] the first five books of the Bible called the law.
[649.96 → 652.18] They took that, interpreted it,
[653.00 → 655.56] made 613 strict laws from it,
[655.62 → 656.00] and said,
[656.20 → 657.56] you need to keep all of these
[657.56 → 659.18] in order for you to be good enough,
[659.34 → 660.30] to be holy enough,
[660.36 → 661.32] to be pure enough
[661.32 → 662.80] to join God's people.
[663.12 → 664.60] And obviously, obviously,
[665.32 → 667.06] the Romans, Gentile, foreigners,
[667.48 → 668.80] and like tax collectors
[668.80 → 671.22] don't belong in our purity circle.
[672.62 → 673.72] They believed,
[673.80 → 674.76] and so they taught
[674.76 → 676.80] that Israel's identity itself,
[677.20 → 678.60] their blessed future,
[678.60 → 680.14] which is the restoration of God's kingdom
[680.14 → 680.78] and their vision,
[681.22 → 682.60] it all depended
[682.60 → 684.96] on their own acts of holiness
[684.96 → 686.68] and being achieved
[686.68 → 688.20] through their interpretation of the laws,
[688.26 → 688.76] as we said.
[690.10 → 691.82] And so, in that context then,
[692.04 → 693.26] is why they viewed,
[693.40 → 694.82] specifically tax collectors,
[695.34 → 696.32] as not good enough,
[696.82 → 698.30] and they viewed them as sinners.
[699.66 → 701.62] Another little background tidbit for you.
[701.84 → 703.94] The tax collectors during Jesus' time
[703.94 → 705.80] were Jews who were notorious
[705.80 → 707.80] for betraying their own people.
[708.46 → 710.40] They worked for the Roman government,
[710.64 → 711.16] first,
[711.22 → 712.56] they worked for the foreigners,
[713.12 → 714.24] and were tasked
[714.24 → 715.50] to collect taxes
[715.50 → 716.92] on all sorts of things,
[717.18 → 718.94] like even the number of wheels
[718.94 → 719.64] on your wagon
[719.64 → 721.28] on using a certain type of road.
[721.82 → 723.02] You have to pay tax for that.
[723.58 → 724.70] And on top of that,
[724.94 → 726.00] these tax collectors
[726.00 → 727.34] were allowed to keep
[727.34 → 729.08] any surplus money
[729.08 → 730.82] that they collected
[730.82 → 733.18] after they hit the mandated quota
[733.18 → 734.12] from the Roman government.
[735.26 → 736.82] And so, this was a two-fold hate.
[737.68 → 739.00] One, they worked
[739.00 → 740.48] for the foreigners themselves
[740.48 → 741.94] that didn't belong
[741.94 → 743.00] in God's kingdom
[743.00 → 744.68] in the eyes of the Pharisees.
[745.24 → 745.84] And two,
[746.50 → 747.40] they were cheating
[747.40 → 748.50] their own people.
[750.40 → 752.30] They were getting in the way
[752.30 → 753.12] of establishing
[753.12 → 754.38] God's kingdom on earth.
[754.46 → 755.60] And so, in the eyes
[755.60 → 756.40] of the Pharisees,
[756.90 → 758.16] they, the tax collectors,
[758.16 → 759.50] and anyone who sat
[759.50 → 760.48] with them for a meal
[760.48 → 762.38] were outright sinners.
[763.70 → 765.26] It was in their eyes
[765.26 → 766.28] that they saw them
[766.28 → 767.38] as outright sinners.
[767.66 → 768.72] And so, it's kind of interesting.
[768.82 → 770.02] When you look at the passage today,
[770.72 → 772.70] the author of this gospel, Luke,
[773.10 → 776.40] he records how Levi invites Jesus
[776.40 → 776.96] to his home
[776.96 → 777.76] for a great banquet.
[778.02 → 778.92] And this is a side point,
[779.02 → 780.48] but when Jesus calls you
[780.48 → 781.34] to his family,
[781.46 → 782.18] it is a party.
[782.58 → 783.26] You are invited
[783.26 → 784.40] to a great banquet.
[784.80 → 785.54] And so, that's what Levi
[785.54 → 786.46] does for Jesus.
[786.46 → 787.56] And the guest list
[787.56 → 788.32] is a bunch
[788.32 → 789.14] of tax collectors
[789.14 → 789.92] and others
[789.92 → 791.84] is the way Luke records it.
[792.10 → 793.10] But then you go down
[793.10 → 793.76] a few verses.
[794.32 → 795.16] The Pharisees come
[795.16 → 796.10] and ask the disciples
[796.10 → 796.54] of Jesus.
[797.14 → 797.54] And do you know
[797.54 → 798.30] what they say to them?
[799.20 → 801.24] Why does your teacher, Jesus,
[801.42 → 802.56] and why do you guys
[802.56 → 804.24] eat and share a meal
[804.24 → 805.86] with tax collectors
[805.86 → 807.44] and sinners?
[808.58 → 809.94] It is out of the mouth
[809.94 → 811.12] of the Pharisees
[811.12 → 813.22] that they are called sinners,
[813.36 → 814.24] these tax collectors,
[814.24 → 815.66] and whoever is associated
[815.66 → 816.12] with them.
[817.62 → 818.70] And so, as we build
[818.70 → 819.52] from this background
[819.52 → 821.18] of how the Pharisees
[821.18 → 822.56] built their idea
[822.56 → 823.34] of God's kingdom
[823.34 → 824.02] being restored,
[824.76 → 826.00] it's ironic
[826.00 → 828.38] because they themselves
[828.38 → 829.92] are actually the ones
[829.92 → 830.98] getting in the way
[830.98 → 833.52] of this kingdom of God
[833.52 → 834.24] being restored.
[835.38 → 836.30] That's why,
[836.48 → 837.24] if you remember
[837.24 → 838.42] from our Beatitudes series,
[838.74 → 840.32] it's an upside-down kingdom.
[840.32 → 841.98] The Pharisees saw
[841.98 → 843.14] their restoration
[843.14 → 843.70] of kingdom
[843.70 → 844.88] in a certain way.
[845.68 → 846.50] And they made it
[846.50 → 847.12] so that people
[847.12 → 847.88] were excluded.
[848.00 → 848.88] But Jesus comes
[848.88 → 849.76] and says,
[850.14 → 851.36] all is invited,
[851.54 → 852.50] just like the mission
[852.50 → 853.10] that was given
[853.10 → 854.40] from the beginning,
[854.94 → 855.90] which we will look at.
[856.70 → 857.20] And so,
[857.32 → 858.22] instead of being
[858.22 → 859.46] a light for the world,
[859.54 → 860.28] which is our calling,
[860.68 → 861.44] which was the calling
[861.44 → 862.20] of God's people,
[863.16 → 863.98] to be a light
[863.98 → 864.46] for the world,
[864.60 → 865.38] bringing sinners
[865.38 → 866.46] and foreigners
[866.46 → 867.38] and strangers,
[867.90 → 868.84] bringing them in
[868.84 → 870.14] so that they
[870.14 → 871.38] can experience
[871.38 → 872.08] the power
[872.08 → 872.80] and restoration
[872.80 → 874.00] in God's blessing.
[874.72 → 875.80] Instead of doing that
[875.80 → 876.56] and living out
[876.56 → 877.28] that mission,
[878.10 → 879.60] they made more rules
[879.60 → 881.42] to keep more people out.
[883.06 → 884.92] And when the Pharisees
[884.92 → 886.68] interpreted their scriptures,
[887.08 → 888.06] which is our Old Testament,
[888.18 → 888.98] which is our scriptures
[888.98 → 889.50] as well,
[889.92 → 891.50] they neglected the vision
[891.50 → 892.48] and calling
[892.48 → 893.54] where God calls
[893.54 → 894.64] all nations
[894.64 → 895.68] to this great banquet.
[896.94 → 897.64] And so we read
[897.64 → 898.50] from Isaiah 25.
[898.84 → 900.92] On this mountain,
[901.30 → 902.24] the Lord Almighty
[902.24 → 903.32] will prepare
[903.32 → 904.86] a feast of rich food
[904.86 → 907.04] for all peoples,
[908.26 → 909.72] a banquet of aged wine,
[909.80 → 910.56] the best of meats
[910.56 → 911.68] and the finest of wines.
[911.92 → 912.94] On this mountain,
[913.06 → 913.66] He will destroy
[913.66 → 914.18] the shroud
[914.18 → 914.80] that enfolds
[914.80 → 916.08] all peoples,
[916.46 → 917.26] the sheet that will
[917.26 → 918.86] cover all nations.
[919.04 → 920.20] He will swallow up
[920.20 → 920.86] death forever.
[921.22 → 922.10] The sovereign Lord
[922.10 → 922.94] will wipe away
[922.94 → 923.46] the tears
[923.46 → 925.14] from all faces.
[925.70 → 926.58] He will remove
[926.58 → 927.80] His people's disgrace
[927.80 → 928.70] from all the earth.
[928.84 → 930.34] The Lord has spoken.
[931.98 → 933.38] That's their calling,
[933.52 → 933.92] their mission,
[934.06 → 934.64] their identity.
[936.48 → 938.36] Not to keep more people out,
[938.56 → 939.84] but to bring people in.
[940.38 → 941.26] Bring people in,
[941.32 → 941.86] the foreigners
[941.86 → 943.36] and the strangers
[943.36 → 944.60] that have a broken
[944.60 → 945.68] relationship with God,
[945.84 → 946.78] to bring them in
[946.78 → 947.84] side by side,
[947.98 → 948.72] walking with them,
[948.82 → 949.80] growing with them,
[950.22 → 951.30] and to feel
[951.30 → 952.18] and experience
[952.18 → 952.84] the restoration
[952.84 → 953.90] that happens
[953.90 → 954.90] with God's blessing.
[954.90 → 958.48] This is their core identity.
[958.84 → 959.50] And it's not just
[959.50 → 960.44] from the prophet Isaiah
[960.44 → 961.50] that we get this image.
[961.92 → 962.46] It's actually
[962.46 → 963.86] from the Torah itself
[963.86 → 964.92] where they're called
[964.92 → 965.88] to bring in foreigners.
[966.40 → 967.52] From Leviticus 19,
[967.68 → 968.12] we read,
[968.12 → 969.18] the foreigner,
[969.18 → 970.04] the stranger
[970.04 → 971.34] residing among you
[971.34 → 972.54] must be treated
[972.54 → 973.98] as your native born.
[975.14 → 976.62] Love them as yourself
[976.62 → 978.04] for you are foreigners
[978.04 → 978.60] in Egypt.
[979.02 → 980.40] I am the Lord your God.
[981.28 → 983.00] I saved you
[983.00 → 984.18] because you are foreigners
[984.18 → 984.72] in Egypt.
[985.10 → 986.14] You were slaves
[986.14 → 987.36] and I freed you
[987.36 → 988.62] out of my love.
[989.22 → 989.88] And you're supposed
[989.88 → 991.30] to reflect that love
[991.30 → 992.42] to strangers,
[992.58 → 993.08] to foreigners,
[993.26 → 994.44] and bring them in
[994.44 → 995.92] to God's real blessing.
[995.92 → 997.66] What it means to be real,
[998.16 → 998.70] flourishing,
[999.00 → 1000.22] made in the image of God.
[1002.98 → 1004.34] And so that's the mission
[1004.34 → 1005.04] of God's people.
[1005.16 → 1006.08] But the Pharisees
[1006.08 → 1007.04] created a system
[1007.04 → 1008.36] that even many Jews
[1008.36 → 1009.10] could not keep.
[1010.30 → 1011.82] And instead of helping them,
[1012.24 → 1013.74] they despised them
[1013.74 → 1014.40] and hated them
[1014.40 → 1015.24] and judged them
[1015.24 → 1017.04] for coming up short.
[1018.68 → 1020.50] And that's what legalism is.
[1021.38 → 1022.40] And that's a real temptation
[1022.40 → 1023.46] that we face today
[1023.46 → 1024.28] as a church too.
[1024.28 → 1027.18] We have sometimes
[1027.18 → 1028.00] this tendency
[1028.00 → 1029.32] to want to condemn
[1029.32 → 1030.70] sin and wrongdoing,
[1030.92 → 1032.06] but at a distance.
[1033.38 → 1034.96] Instead of coming alongside,
[1035.22 → 1035.46] again,
[1035.56 → 1036.52] God's mission for us,
[1036.92 → 1037.70] coming alongside,
[1037.98 → 1038.54] proclaiming,
[1038.60 → 1039.24] and demonstrating
[1039.24 → 1040.70] the transforming grace
[1040.70 → 1041.34] of God,
[1041.48 → 1043.34] we sometimes sit at a distance
[1043.34 → 1044.64] and judge and condemn.
[1045.24 → 1045.56] Why?
[1046.12 → 1046.46] One,
[1046.50 → 1047.62] it's easier that way.
[1047.98 → 1048.42] And two,
[1048.70 → 1049.48] we don't have
[1049.48 → 1050.26] those same struggles.
[1051.52 → 1052.00] Yeah,
[1052.08 → 1052.86] that's your struggle.
[1052.86 → 1054.28] You shouldn't do it that way.
[1054.36 → 1055.36] You shouldn't live that way.
[1055.86 → 1056.04] Yeah.
[1056.44 → 1057.50] We sit at a distance
[1057.50 → 1058.60] and we think we're better
[1058.60 → 1059.74] because we don't have
[1059.74 → 1061.16] those same specific struggles.
[1062.72 → 1063.46] And so,
[1063.58 → 1064.66] instead of inviting
[1064.66 → 1065.96] our quote-unquote enemies,
[1066.66 → 1068.44] people who we may not agree
[1068.44 → 1069.54] with on certain things,
[1070.10 → 1071.76] maybe estranged family members,
[1071.76 → 1073.42] or friends that have struggles,
[1073.76 → 1075.00] or are dealing with addictions
[1075.00 → 1075.98] or mental illness,
[1076.30 → 1077.72] instead of inviting them in
[1077.72 → 1078.76] and walking alongside,
[1079.08 → 1080.88] we sometimes just sit there
[1080.88 → 1081.58] and judge
[1081.58 → 1084.06] because those are not our sins.
[1085.10 → 1086.70] That's not my brokenness.
[1086.86 → 1087.42] I'm better.
[1089.92 → 1091.24] This is even reflected
[1091.24 → 1092.32] in our own society.
[1093.28 → 1094.28] So whenever you go
[1094.28 → 1095.30] to social gatherings,
[1095.68 → 1096.26] well, for me,
[1096.46 → 1097.16] if I just go
[1097.16 → 1098.36] and pick up Joseph from school,
[1098.42 → 1099.10] it's very evident.
[1099.10 → 1101.04] You see social segregation
[1101.04 → 1102.38] happening very naturally.
[1104.08 → 1104.52] Everyone,
[1104.74 → 1105.62] including myself
[1105.62 → 1106.24] and Koreans,
[1106.80 → 1107.38] have this
[1107.38 → 1108.34] Pharisaic,
[1108.46 → 1109.10] legalistic temptation
[1109.64 → 1111.42] to create our own
[1111.42 → 1112.72] purity standards,
[1112.88 → 1114.12] whatever that's defined as,
[1114.70 → 1115.80] and exclude others
[1115.80 → 1116.62] who don't fit
[1116.62 → 1117.56] that standard.
[1119.10 → 1120.30] And especially,
[1120.52 → 1121.30] to build on that,
[1121.72 → 1123.00] we especially don't
[1123.00 → 1124.04] invite these
[1124.04 → 1125.66] non-pure people
[1125.66 → 1126.76] into our own homes,
[1126.86 → 1127.14] do we?
[1127.14 → 1128.22] No.
[1128.80 → 1130.08] That would force us
[1130.08 → 1130.96] to engage
[1130.96 → 1132.70] in real meaningful relationship.
[1133.98 → 1135.94] Imagine someone you hate,
[1136.32 → 1137.34] your quote-unquote enemy,
[1137.52 → 1138.36] is sitting right across
[1138.36 → 1139.06] your dinner table.
[1141.60 → 1143.22] It's a real challenge
[1143.22 → 1144.80] that we face
[1144.80 → 1145.74] in our real lives,
[1145.78 → 1146.98] in our day-to-day lives,
[1147.04 → 1148.34] as we try to reflect
[1148.34 → 1149.24] God's hospitality
[1149.24 → 1150.14] to others.
[1150.92 → 1152.08] It's as if
[1152.08 → 1152.72] the world
[1152.72 → 1153.88] is dragging us
[1153.88 → 1155.02] in things that we're
[1155.02 → 1156.50] weird and counter-cultural
[1156.50 → 1158.12] if we show hospitality
[1158.12 → 1159.04] to everyone.
[1160.68 → 1161.98] The world tells us
[1161.98 → 1163.04] that you only show
[1163.04 → 1163.60] hospitality
[1163.60 → 1165.64] to your own people.
[1167.58 → 1168.44] And so this is
[1168.44 → 1169.26] the crossroads
[1169.26 → 1169.88] that we live in,
[1169.96 → 1170.34] isn't it?
[1171.96 → 1173.06] The crossroads
[1173.06 → 1173.60] that we live in
[1173.60 → 1174.26] as God's people,
[1174.36 → 1175.40] the story of the world,
[1175.68 → 1176.40] and specifically
[1176.40 → 1177.40] our own
[1177.40 → 1179.14] Western individualistic
[1179.14 → 1179.68] culture,
[1179.94 → 1180.80] tells us
[1180.80 → 1181.62] and pulls us
[1181.62 → 1182.36] to the story
[1182.36 → 1183.44] that we don't belong in.
[1183.44 → 1185.12] It goes against
[1185.12 → 1185.96] the biblical story
[1185.96 → 1186.80] that we live in
[1186.80 → 1188.10] and that we belong to
[1188.10 → 1189.74] because our biblical story
[1189.74 → 1191.02] says that we all
[1191.02 → 1192.30] belong in God's family.
[1192.92 → 1194.00] We are extended
[1194.00 → 1195.26] God's love
[1195.26 → 1195.84] of hospitality
[1195.84 → 1197.20] and we are to extend
[1197.20 → 1198.10] that same love
[1198.10 → 1198.66] to others,
[1198.94 → 1199.78] whoever that other
[1199.78 → 1200.44] may be.
[1202.22 → 1202.64] And so,
[1203.12 → 1204.30] out of God's
[1204.30 → 1205.70] own love for us,
[1205.90 → 1206.48] out of His
[1206.48 → 1207.30] unconditional,
[1207.74 → 1209.16] non-judgmental love,
[1209.44 → 1210.16] He has invited
[1210.16 → 1210.94] all of us
[1210.94 → 1212.30] into His family first.
[1213.98 → 1215.26] And Misha read this
[1215.26 → 1216.08] as she led service
[1216.08 → 1216.92] for us last week.
[1216.98 → 1217.82] From Ephesians 2,
[1217.90 → 1218.32] we read,
[1219.02 → 1219.92] For through Him,
[1220.44 → 1221.84] through Christ our Saviour,
[1222.20 → 1223.40] we both have access
[1223.40 → 1224.14] to the Father
[1224.14 → 1225.14] by one Spirit.
[1225.62 → 1226.34] And consequently,
[1226.68 → 1227.60] you are no longer
[1227.60 → 1228.18] foreigners,
[1228.64 → 1229.44] you are no longer
[1229.44 → 1230.02] strangers,
[1230.34 → 1231.40] but fellow citizens
[1231.40 → 1232.64] with God's people
[1232.64 → 1234.00] and also members
[1234.00 → 1235.86] of His own household,
[1236.16 → 1237.32] His family.
[1238.24 → 1239.32] That's what we
[1239.32 → 1240.44] are invited into.
[1240.94 → 1242.30] And we get to share
[1242.30 → 1243.32] that love with others.
[1244.60 → 1245.70] That's good news
[1245.70 → 1246.20] for us.
[1246.30 → 1247.06] That's good news
[1247.06 → 1247.72] for the world.
[1249.46 → 1250.28] Jesus has not
[1250.28 → 1250.96] come for the
[1251.20 → 1252.48] Jesus has come
[1252.48 → 1253.14] for the sick.
[1253.68 → 1254.26] He has come
[1254.26 → 1254.84] for the broken
[1254.84 → 1256.12] and offers restoration
[1256.12 → 1257.34] and healing,
[1258.12 → 1259.08] not judgment
[1259.08 → 1259.80] and shame.
[1261.30 → 1262.06] He says,
[1262.18 → 1263.06] it's not the healthy
[1263.06 → 1263.86] who need a doctor.
[1265.32 → 1266.22] Jesus has come
[1266.22 → 1266.94] to fulfill
[1266.94 → 1268.56] and He has fulfilled
[1268.56 → 1269.46] that mission
[1269.46 → 1270.44] to call sinners
[1270.44 → 1271.42] to repentance.
[1272.00 → 1272.48] Not just,
[1272.78 → 1273.62] He didn't just come
[1273.62 → 1274.62] to pay lip service
[1274.62 → 1275.86] to people who think
[1275.86 → 1276.42] that they already
[1276.42 → 1277.30] have it figured out,
[1277.44 → 1278.32] who think they were
[1278.32 → 1278.94] good enough,
[1279.12 → 1279.56] that they were
[1279.56 → 1280.90] religiously fit enough
[1280.90 → 1281.98] to enter God's kingdom.
[1282.52 → 1283.14] Jesus says,
[1283.26 → 1284.08] He has come
[1284.08 → 1285.58] to call sinners
[1285.58 → 1286.56] to repentance.
[1289.98 → 1291.38] God demonstrates
[1291.38 → 1292.70] His love for us
[1292.70 → 1293.18] in this.
[1293.18 → 1294.86] while we were
[1294.86 → 1295.92] still sinners.
[1297.68 → 1298.66] Not when we were
[1298.66 → 1299.16] good enough.
[1299.54 → 1300.42] While we were
[1300.42 → 1301.18] still sinners,
[1301.40 → 1302.36] He died for us.
[1303.06 → 1304.04] That's the same
[1304.04 → 1304.96] gospel truth
[1304.96 → 1305.94] for us.
[1307.78 → 1308.76] And a common saying
[1308.76 → 1309.76] that we use in church
[1309.76 → 1310.64] is that we are
[1310.64 → 1312.28] grafted into His family
[1312.28 → 1315.04] because we are shown,
[1315.22 → 1316.54] we too are shown
[1316.54 → 1317.64] mercy and grace
[1317.64 → 1318.14] and love
[1318.14 → 1319.26] in our time
[1319.26 → 1320.32] of time
[1320.32 → 1321.08] of shortcoming
[1321.08 → 1322.20] and brokenness.
[1323.66 → 1325.00] Through the sacrificial
[1325.00 → 1325.78] love of Jesus
[1325.78 → 1326.62] on the cross,
[1327.12 → 1328.26] He invites us
[1328.26 → 1329.10] to share a meal
[1329.10 → 1329.56] with Him.
[1330.00 → 1330.94] And this is expressed
[1330.94 → 1332.22] when we share
[1332.22 → 1332.90] in the sacrament
[1332.90 → 1333.50] of communion.
[1334.24 → 1335.14] We get to share
[1335.14 → 1335.64] that today.
[1335.82 → 1336.56] You are invited
[1336.56 → 1337.82] wherever you are
[1337.82 → 1338.22] in life,
[1338.32 → 1339.40] wherever and whatever
[1339.40 → 1340.26] your brokenness
[1340.26 → 1341.22] and your struggle is.
[1341.22 → 1342.68] Jesus invites you
[1342.68 → 1343.54] to His table
[1343.54 → 1345.58] because His grace
[1345.58 → 1346.74] is all the more.
[1347.46 → 1348.58] He is able.
[1349.14 → 1350.26] He is able
[1350.26 → 1350.82] to cover
[1350.82 → 1352.24] all of our sins.
[1352.38 → 1352.58] Amen?
[1355.38 → 1356.36] And so instead
[1356.36 → 1356.98] of worrying
[1356.98 → 1358.76] about being associated
[1358.76 → 1359.54] with sin
[1359.54 → 1360.20] and brokenness,
[1360.44 → 1361.12] being afraid
[1361.12 → 1361.64] that sin
[1361.64 → 1362.80] might overtake us,
[1363.20 → 1364.26] it is to take courage
[1364.26 → 1365.34] and be comforted
[1365.34 → 1365.90] by the fact
[1365.90 → 1366.54] that His grace
[1366.54 → 1367.16] is all the more.
[1368.06 → 1368.90] And so when talking
[1368.90 → 1370.02] about the early church,
[1370.42 → 1371.20] one writer writes,
[1371.22 → 1372.48] writes it this way,
[1373.52 → 1374.82] by God's grace
[1374.82 → 1375.60] and power
[1375.60 → 1376.84] and because
[1376.84 → 1378.02] of the sacrificial
[1378.02 → 1379.40] welcome they,
[1379.82 → 1380.52] the early church,
[1380.60 → 1381.26] had experienced
[1381.26 → 1381.88] in Christ,
[1382.36 → 1382.94] they learned
[1382.94 → 1383.74] to sit down
[1383.74 → 1384.30] at a table
[1384.30 → 1385.82] and share their homes
[1385.82 → 1386.50] and lives
[1386.50 → 1387.24] with people
[1387.24 → 1388.70] they previously viewed
[1388.70 → 1389.68] as dirty
[1389.68 → 1390.92] or less than human.
[1391.82 → 1392.84] They sorted out
[1392.84 → 1393.44] this new way
[1393.44 → 1393.84] of living
[1393.84 → 1394.72] and valuing
[1394.72 → 1395.60] in the context
[1395.60 → 1396.40] of offering
[1396.40 → 1397.10] one another
[1397.10 → 1398.80] hospitality,
[1399.36 → 1400.86] the way they
[1400.86 → 1401.90] received hospitality
[1401.90 → 1402.50] from God.
[1404.24 → 1405.48] And so the image
[1405.48 → 1406.82] of our calling then,
[1407.30 → 1408.36] this beautiful image,
[1408.62 → 1409.28] is that we are
[1409.28 → 1410.04] broken bowls
[1410.04 → 1410.94] mended together
[1410.94 → 1412.50] and God's love
[1412.50 → 1413.32] expressed through
[1413.32 → 1414.12] His hospitality
[1414.12 → 1415.72] for us
[1415.72 → 1416.90] as He invites us
[1416.90 → 1417.46] to His table
[1417.46 → 1418.76] is to take our bowl
[1418.76 → 1419.90] and let that love
[1419.90 → 1420.80] fill our bowl
[1420.80 → 1422.02] and also to let it
[1422.02 → 1422.74] overflow
[1422.74 → 1424.12] onto others.
[1424.12 → 1426.72] It's about
[1426.72 → 1427.76] being together,
[1428.14 → 1428.86] doing life,
[1429.12 → 1429.92] sharing a meal
[1429.92 → 1430.92] when we get together
[1430.92 → 1431.70] in small groups,
[1431.88 → 1433.16] when we invite families
[1433.16 → 1434.14] that we don't know
[1434.14 → 1434.62] very well
[1434.62 → 1435.46] into our homes
[1435.46 → 1436.52] or maybe just
[1436.52 → 1437.50] going for coffee
[1437.50 → 1438.10] with a friend
[1438.10 → 1439.08] or co-worker
[1439.08 → 1440.70] from work
[1440.70 → 1441.54] that you don't know
[1441.54 → 1442.10] very well.
[1443.68 → 1445.04] Even in the
[1445.04 → 1446.28] busyness of life,
[1446.62 → 1447.68] which is a real idol
[1447.68 → 1448.34] that we face
[1448.34 → 1448.86] every day,
[1449.08 → 1449.92] to take that
[1449.92 → 1450.80] extra effort
[1450.80 → 1452.34] and to spend time
[1452.34 → 1452.96] with those
[1452.96 → 1453.80] who you know
[1453.80 → 1454.54] may be lonely
[1454.54 → 1455.68] or are struggling.
[1456.48 → 1457.86] It's to do life
[1457.86 → 1458.46] with them.
[1459.78 → 1460.44] And so the question
[1460.44 → 1460.98] to you
[1460.98 → 1462.32] this morning is,
[1462.52 → 1463.48] is there a family
[1463.48 → 1464.24] you know
[1464.24 → 1464.84] is struggling?
[1466.02 → 1466.82] Struggling with
[1466.82 → 1467.90] difficult family members
[1467.90 → 1468.48] or struggling
[1468.48 → 1469.90] with their own children?
[1470.22 → 1471.22] Going through struggles
[1471.22 → 1472.00] of their own
[1472.00 → 1472.84] with health,
[1472.98 → 1473.52] with addictions,
[1473.72 → 1474.54] with mental illness,
[1474.88 → 1476.36] with relationship trouble?
[1477.36 → 1478.62] Are there families
[1478.62 → 1480.04] even in our own church
[1480.04 → 1481.52] or in your own neighbourhood
[1481.52 → 1482.68] who are excluded,
[1483.04 → 1483.74] who are lonely?
[1484.38 → 1485.64] And they are figuratively
[1485.64 → 1486.86] and literally
[1486.86 → 1487.50] foreigners
[1487.50 → 1488.54] in this country.
[1491.06 → 1491.98] And so this is
[1491.98 → 1492.46] a good thing
[1492.46 → 1492.96] to remember
[1492.96 → 1494.02] as Dave reminded me
[1494.02 → 1494.84] this past week.
[1495.72 → 1495.94] See,
[1496.02 → 1496.82] the opportunity
[1496.82 → 1497.90] for this sort of
[1497.90 → 1498.80] kingdom vision,
[1499.34 → 1500.28] kingdom living
[1500.28 → 1502.48] through our ministry
[1502.48 → 1503.24] of hospitality,
[1504.02 → 1504.78] through our ordinary
[1504.78 → 1506.10] acts of hospitality
[1506.10 → 1507.62] is already there.
[1507.80 → 1508.78] That opportunity
[1508.78 → 1510.16] for that ministry
[1510.16 → 1511.68] is already around us.
[1512.84 → 1513.62] And all you need,
[1513.66 → 1514.40] and I love this phrase,
[1514.52 → 1515.26] all you need
[1515.26 → 1517.24] is gospel intentionality.
[1520.44 → 1521.82] And so through
[1521.82 → 1523.52] that gospel intentionality
[1523.52 → 1524.22] and through our
[1524.22 → 1525.24] ordinary acts
[1525.24 → 1526.24] of hospitality,
[1526.48 → 1528.30] we reflect God's love.
[1529.04 → 1530.08] And to go one step further,
[1530.64 → 1532.26] what if that ordinary act
[1532.26 → 1533.40] of hospitality
[1533.40 → 1535.26] was shown to someone
[1535.26 → 1535.88] you hated?
[1536.78 → 1537.84] Someone you would label,
[1537.84 → 1538.56] quote unquote,
[1538.78 → 1539.36] as enemies,
[1540.08 → 1540.72] as foreigners,
[1540.92 → 1541.42] as strangers
[1541.42 → 1542.72] that you don't associate with?
[1543.66 → 1544.86] Just like my mom
[1544.86 → 1546.10] invited my enemy,
[1546.40 → 1546.82] my bully,
[1547.02 → 1547.52] to our home.
[1548.62 → 1549.70] Can you imagine
[1549.70 → 1551.02] what that would be like?
[1553.90 → 1555.08] And so at this point,
[1555.18 → 1555.90] I want to ask,
[1556.02 → 1556.82] who are you inviting
[1556.82 → 1557.86] to your dinner table
[1557.86 → 1559.10] or your lunch table?
[1560.10 → 1561.70] In today's Thanksgiving morning,
[1562.12 → 1562.46] Thanksgiving,
[1563.22 → 1563.98] who are you inviting?
[1563.98 → 1565.58] perfect opportunity
[1565.58 → 1567.12] for you to extend
[1567.12 → 1568.38] that love of hospitality
[1568.38 → 1569.08] to others.
[1570.28 → 1570.90] And just because
[1570.90 → 1571.80] I preached on
[1571.80 → 1572.60] inviting enemies
[1572.60 → 1573.26] to your table,
[1573.58 → 1574.78] whoever you have already
[1574.78 → 1576.10] invited and planned
[1576.10 → 1577.36] to have over at your house,
[1577.58 → 1578.44] don't call them enemies.
[1579.24 → 1580.74] You don't have to be enemies
[1580.74 → 1581.90] to extend hospitality.
[1582.66 → 1583.68] You share that love
[1583.68 → 1584.62] with everyone
[1584.62 → 1585.70] just as God
[1585.70 → 1587.00] extended His love to us.
[1587.24 → 1588.32] And practically speaking,
[1588.92 → 1590.46] if you are not able
[1590.46 → 1591.20] to invite someone
[1591.20 → 1592.46] for various reasons,
[1592.72 → 1593.64] but you yourself
[1593.64 → 1594.38] are invited,
[1595.54 → 1596.32] take joy
[1596.32 → 1597.32] and be blessed
[1597.32 → 1598.04] in that love
[1598.04 → 1599.24] that is extended to you.
[1600.48 → 1601.92] And the encouragement then
[1601.92 → 1603.36] is to be equipped,
[1603.70 → 1604.76] to be inspired,
[1605.02 → 1605.72] and motivated
[1605.72 → 1608.32] to share that hospitable love
[1608.32 → 1609.34] to those you know
[1609.34 → 1610.66] that need it,
[1610.88 → 1611.76] that need that love.
[1613.00 → 1613.64] And so isn't that
[1613.64 → 1614.54] a beautiful image?
[1615.44 → 1615.64] Like,
[1615.96 → 1616.80] through the ministries
[1616.80 → 1618.52] that we are already part of
[1618.52 → 1619.64] in our church,
[1619.76 → 1620.84] in your own homes,
[1620.84 → 1621.88] that you are already
[1621.88 → 1623.06] doing a great job of,
[1623.38 → 1624.20] showing hospitality
[1624.20 → 1624.94] to others.
[1625.48 → 1626.66] In all the things
[1626.66 → 1627.26] that we do,
[1628.02 → 1629.00] we are being,
[1629.56 → 1630.02] currently,
[1630.30 → 1631.58] through God's own Spirit,
[1631.92 → 1632.46] equipped
[1632.46 → 1634.40] and inspired
[1634.40 → 1635.88] to extend that love
[1635.88 → 1636.44] to others.
[1636.90 → 1637.98] It's already happening.
[1638.88 → 1640.04] It's happening here at Hope.
[1640.24 → 1641.58] It's happening in your homes.
[1641.84 → 1643.42] Be more intentional about it.
[1644.18 → 1644.92] And whoever God
[1644.92 → 1646.02] gives you in your heart,
[1646.38 → 1647.50] extend that ministry
[1647.50 → 1648.22] of hospitality
[1648.22 → 1649.38] and invite them
[1649.38 → 1651.00] and share God's love.
[1651.84 → 1652.72] In so doing,
[1653.06 → 1654.10] we are living out
[1654.10 → 1654.70] the core
[1654.70 → 1656.36] of our Christian identity.
[1657.68 → 1658.24] Blessed
[1658.24 → 1659.82] to be a blessing.
[1660.96 → 1662.12] And it all starts
[1662.12 → 1662.68] with God.
[1663.82 → 1665.34] It all starts with God.
[1665.42 → 1666.12] We love
[1666.12 → 1666.70] because
[1666.70 → 1667.66] He first
[1667.66 → 1668.58] loved us.
[1669.62 → 1670.68] We give thanks
[1670.68 → 1671.62] to God this morning
[1671.62 → 1672.26] for His
[1672.26 → 1673.36] sacrificial love.
[1673.76 → 1674.96] God's faithfulness,
[1674.96 → 1675.88] even when we
[1675.88 → 1676.62] come up short,
[1677.08 → 1677.94] even when we
[1677.94 → 1678.74] neglect
[1678.74 → 1679.78] or maybe forget,
[1680.26 → 1681.14] maybe on purpose,
[1681.80 → 1682.68] to invite those
[1682.68 → 1683.58] that we know
[1683.58 → 1684.28] need love
[1684.28 → 1685.00] and hospitality.
[1686.20 → 1687.18] Wherever we struggle,
[1687.58 → 1689.56] wherever we make
[1689.56 → 1690.02] the effort,
[1690.26 → 1691.24] God is right there.
[1691.60 → 1692.62] And in His love,
[1692.88 → 1693.80] He blesses us,
[1693.94 → 1694.92] equips us
[1694.92 → 1696.16] to be
[1696.16 → 1697.50] a blessing
[1697.50 → 1698.14] for others.
[1698.62 → 1698.84] And so,
[1698.96 → 1699.56] may that love
[1699.56 → 1700.10] overflow.
[1700.98 → 1701.72] May that love
[1701.72 → 1702.80] overflow even today
[1702.80 → 1704.16] as we invite those
[1704.16 → 1705.36] for Thanksgiving meal,
[1705.80 → 1707.20] for a time of fellowship
[1707.20 → 1707.88] and extend
[1707.88 → 1708.94] that love
[1708.94 → 1709.48] to others.
[1710.00 → 1710.66] May that be
[1710.66 → 1711.16] the calling
[1711.16 → 1711.78] and encouragement
[1711.78 → 1712.66] for us this morning,
[1712.78 → 1712.94] Hope.
[1713.60 → 1714.24] Let's pray.
[1722.42 → 1723.38] Loving Father,
[1724.00 → 1724.88] we give You
[1724.88 → 1725.80] thanks this morning.
[1728.14 → 1729.30] And I thank You
[1729.30 → 1730.10] that You have
[1730.10 → 1731.38] given us
[1731.38 → 1732.06] this season
[1732.06 → 1732.92] called Thanksgiving
[1732.92 → 1734.08] that we are reminded
[1734.08 → 1735.84] of what we have
[1735.84 → 1737.72] and the gratitude
[1737.72 → 1738.96] that we sometimes
[1738.96 → 1740.52] forget to express
[1740.52 → 1740.98] to You
[1740.98 → 1742.52] as You bless us
[1742.52 → 1743.66] in our families,

[1754.42 → 1755.02] I thank You
[1755.02 → 1755.66] that today,
[1756.22 → 1757.14] during this Thanksgiving,
[1757.36 → 1758.08] we are reminded
[1758.08 → 1759.22] that we get to reflect

[1760.52 → 1761.48] and Your faithfulness
[1761.48 → 1763.14] and that we are equipped
[1763.14 → 1764.96] and given Your love
[1764.96 → 1766.08] so that it may overflow
[1766.08 → 1766.90] onto others.
[1767.44 → 1768.44] Give us the courage,
[1768.92 → 1770.02] give us the inspiration
[1770.02 → 1771.12] and the imagination
[1771.12 → 1772.96] to reach and extend
[1772.96 → 1773.80] this love
[1773.80 → 1774.60] of hospitality
[1774.60 → 1775.48] to others.
[1775.84 → 1776.62] Whoever You give
[1776.62 → 1778.16] to our minds
[1778.16 → 1778.70] and our hearts,
[1778.82 → 1780.34] may we take that step
[1780.34 → 1783.12] and extend
[1783.12 → 1784.06] and bless others
[1784.06 → 1784.82] with Your love.
[1785.32 → 1785.86] We thank You
[1785.86 → 1786.54] for this, Lord.
[1786.64 → 1787.50] Be glorified
[1787.50 → 1789.58] as we participate
[1789.58 → 1790.44] in Your mission
[1790.44 → 1791.42] of redemption together.
