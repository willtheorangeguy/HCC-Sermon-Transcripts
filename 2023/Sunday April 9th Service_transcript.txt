[0.00 --> 4.60]  Well, that was beautiful. Thank you. I want to say thank you to all of our young musicians
[4.60 --> 9.98]  who have been leading us throughout this service, and Leanne, the woman over here who's been doing
[9.98 --> 14.08]  an incredible amount of work behind the scenes to bless our church on Easter Sunday. Thank you,
[14.12 --> 27.22]  Leanne. Yes. Now, if you are a child age three to grade three, you are now invited upstairs to
[27.22 --> 31.50]  our cornerstone ministry. If you're new to our church and it's your first time here, you can
[31.50 --> 35.74]  just follow the kids who are going upstairs. That's where our children are discipled into the
[35.74 --> 38.82]  story, and they're going to hear their own version, actually, today of the Easter story
[38.82 --> 51.02]  through puppets. You can pick your children up after the service upstairs. Also, if you have a
[51.02 --> 55.96]  youth-aged grade four to grade seven, there's also launch upstairs in the youth room. So,
[55.96 --> 60.24]  our youth aged grade four to grade seven are invited up at this time as well.
[64.08 --> 69.68]  All right. Well, we've been working throughout the season of Lent on this series on hardship,
[69.92 --> 73.68]  on pain, on suffering, and we've been looking at it through the lens of this very unpopular
[73.68 --> 79.00]  promise of Jesus. And the unpopular promise of Jesus is in John 16, 33, in this world,
[79.00 --> 84.18]  you will have trouble. And we've been looking at all that trouble. Now, finally, on Easter Sunday,
[84.18 --> 86.82]  we get to look at the second half of that promise Jesus makes where he says,
[86.90 --> 91.48]  in the world you'll have trouble, but take heart. I have overcome the world. And this morning,
[91.62 --> 97.42]  we celebrate that Jesus has overcome, that the grave is empty, he has defeated death,
[97.46 --> 102.36]  and we as witnesses who believe in him come to celebrate resurrection life.
[103.50 --> 107.46]  Now, the passage I'm going to read on, preach on this morning is from Romans chapter eight. If you
[107.46 --> 112.68]  have a Bible, you can turn with me. I'm going to start reading in verse 31. These are words of
[112.68 --> 118.22]  celebration. Paul is just in full-on celebrating preaching mode here, and he wants to give believers
[118.22 --> 124.92]  confidence in what has taken place through Jesus. And we read,
[124.92 --> 133.56]  what then shall we say in response to all these things? If God is for us, who could be against us?
[134.16 --> 140.90]  He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also along with him
[140.90 --> 147.48]  graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
[147.48 --> 157.02]  It's God who justifies. Who can condemn? No one. Christ Jesus who died, more than that, who is raised to
[157.02 --> 164.10]  life, is at the right hand of God, and is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of
[164.10 --> 170.82]  Christ? Shall trouble, or hardship, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword?
[170.82 --> 177.20]  As it is written, for your sake we face death all day long. We are considered a sheep to be slaughtered.
[178.18 --> 185.54]  No. In all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that
[185.54 --> 192.50]  neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
[193.18 --> 199.78]  neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all of creation will be able to separate us from the love of
[199.78 --> 202.76]  God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[207.78 --> 212.70]  Well, just under a year ago, Misha, our youth pastor, came into my office and she said,
[213.04 --> 218.24]  Dave, I've got this idea. What I want to do is, can I ask that night with our senior youth,
[218.32 --> 222.82]  where they come and they can ask any question they want about the Bible, about faith, about life,
[222.90 --> 228.20]  about culture. I said, Misha, that's a great idea. Go for it. And she said, actually, I want you to be the
[228.20 --> 232.76]  one who answers all the questions. I was like, wow, that sounds like a terrible idea.
[233.80 --> 238.30]  And what we did is two weeks later, the two of us together had a night with our senior youth where
[238.30 --> 244.00]  they asked 50 of the hardest questions about the Bible, violence in the Old Testament, sexuality,
[244.36 --> 247.44]  other religions, you name it. It was a rich night of conversation.
[248.86 --> 253.46]  What I remember about that night, you know, almost a year later, is that there was a whole cluster of
[253.46 --> 256.62]  questions. Some of you youth remember this. There's a whole cluster of questions around,
[257.04 --> 262.82]  how do we trust God? How do we have a confidence in our faith in God? And how do we know God loves us?
[262.86 --> 267.98]  Like there's a cluster around sort of that confidence of faith that really, you know, caught my attention.
[268.62 --> 273.34]  And it reminded me of the challenge, the real challenge that youth face and many of us face,
[273.86 --> 277.78]  just to have a confidence in what we believe in a society that has a very different view on what
[277.78 --> 284.42]  humans are for, what's at the center of reality, what makes life worth living. It's hard. Faith can
[284.42 --> 289.70]  feel fragile. Faith in Jesus can feel weak. And this week, as I was working on this passage,
[289.78 --> 294.18]  I thought about the youth and that conversation we had last year because Paul's writing to a young
[294.18 --> 298.56]  church. He's writing to a church where people did not grow up as Christians. Many of them were
[298.56 --> 304.10]  recent converts, and they had lots of questions around how to hold their faith, how to find the love and
[304.10 --> 309.24]  the power of Jesus in the midst of very challenging circumstances, where most people did not share
[309.24 --> 315.94]  their faith in Jesus. And Romans 8, I believe what Paul's trying to do, with all the rhetorical force
[315.94 --> 323.30]  he knows how, is to help Christians see the hugeness of the gospel. He wants them just to see the hugeness
[323.30 --> 328.06]  of what God has done in the work of Jesus Christ through the empty tomb. And he wants to give them a
[328.06 --> 336.66]  sense of confidence that they have found life in Jesus, that the empty tomb secures all things,
[336.70 --> 342.44]  as he's going to say, for the church that believes in him. So let's walk through this beautiful passage.
[343.94 --> 348.64]  Now, the first thing I need to say about Romans 8 is that it's the culmination of what Romans 5 to 8
[348.64 --> 354.00]  has been saying. And you need to know that in Romans 5 to 8, Paul has been telling the story of the Bible.
[354.00 --> 358.24]  Now, and he has understood, I think we all need to understand that, the only way we can understand
[358.24 --> 363.56]  the resurrection of Jesus is by telling the story. The only way we know what Jesus did is by putting
[363.56 --> 369.46]  it in the context of the biblical story. And in Romans 5 to 8, Paul does a pretty masterful job
[369.46 --> 374.18]  of telling the story of the Bible. And here's how he does it. He says in Romans 5, the entirety of
[374.18 --> 380.64]  humanity has plunged into sin through Adam's rebellion. And we're in this new state of corruption.
[380.64 --> 384.88]  We're in this new state of rebellion. We can't seem to get out of it. And he says, this is how God
[384.88 --> 391.00]  responds to that in the Old Testament. Through a promise made to Abraham, God acts in power by first
[391.00 --> 396.94]  liberating Israel from slavery and bringing them to himself. That's the first thing he does. Secondly,
[397.58 --> 402.20]  God gives them his instruction. He teaches them, this is how you're supposed to live.
[402.96 --> 407.22]  And then thirdly, he promises them, I'm going to place you in this abundant land that is Canaan. It's
[407.22 --> 411.62]  going to be the middle of the ancient Near East. It's a provision, this beautiful land, and the nations
[411.62 --> 417.56]  are going to see the blessing of God as you live in Canaan. That's God's answer to the problem of sin
[417.56 --> 422.46]  through liberation, through giving the law, and then placing Israel in Canaan. You following me so far?
[422.52 --> 427.52]  That's Paul's telling of the Old Testament. And then he says, this is how Jesus fulfills that.
[428.18 --> 432.70]  The power of sin was too great for Israel. They rebelled against God. The Old Testament finishes with them
[432.70 --> 439.06]  in misery, and this is how Jesus steps into the story as an Israelite. Number one, he liberates his people
[439.06 --> 444.14]  from slavery to sin and to death through the cross and the empty tomb.
[445.30 --> 450.90]  Secondly, in the resurrection life that he gives through his resurrection, he shares that with his people,
[450.98 --> 456.56]  the church, so that they can live and obey and have changed hearts that want to follow him.
[456.56 --> 461.98]  And thirdly, he says, you don't just get to inherit the small land of Canaan in the ancient Near East.
[462.64 --> 469.74]  You, through my power, inherit the entire creation. That's how Paul tells the Old Testament story.
[470.22 --> 475.12]  And how Jesus fulfills it. This liberation through the cross, the empty tomb, this giving of his
[475.12 --> 480.10]  resurrection life through the spirit that we now have and share, and now promising us there's going to
[480.10 --> 485.74]  come a day when your bones rot and your bodies die, and then I return in glory, and you will get a
[485.74 --> 492.72]  resurrected body in a resurrected creation to enjoy forever in my presence. All of that is secured
[492.72 --> 499.82]  through the resurrection of Jesus, the firstborn over all creation. After Paul tells that story,
[499.90 --> 504.98]  we get to our passage where he's just now in his culmination moment of celebration. He's basically
[504.98 --> 509.40]  full-on preaching to the church, and he says, I now want you to know what it means for you.
[509.40 --> 513.98]  What it means that Jesus rose from the dead. What it means that you now share in his victorious
[513.98 --> 520.90]  resurrection life. And he gives four rhetorical questions to help the church know how much they
[520.90 --> 530.08]  now have in Jesus. Here are the four questions. First, he says, if God is for us, who can be against us?
[530.44 --> 539.04]  Answer, no one. Second, who shall bring a charge of accusation against us? Answer, no one.
[539.40 --> 549.72]  Third, who can condemn us? Answer, no one. And finally, who shall separate us from the love of Jesus
[549.72 --> 556.00]  Christ? And the answer is, no one. And what I want to do for the rest of my time this morning
[556.00 --> 562.14]  is open up briefly these rich questions and the beautiful answers that I hope will instill in the
[562.14 --> 570.94]  church of Jesus today. Confidence and celebration for what we have in Jesus. So first, Paul asked the
[570.94 --> 577.40]  question, if God is for us, who can be against us? And he goes on to say, he who did not spare his own
[577.40 --> 585.98]  son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things?
[585.98 --> 593.54]  You know, in Advent, you often hear us say from the pulpit that God is with us. You know, when Jesus
[593.54 --> 600.70]  takes on flesh, his name is Emmanuel, which means God is with us. And at Easter, we say, God is for us.
[601.32 --> 607.08]  And what Paul means in this passage is that God is so for us, he goes to great self-sacrificial lengths
[607.08 --> 613.28]  for our sake. He could, if he wanted to, leave us in sin. He could, if he wanted to, leave us in our
[613.28 --> 620.20]  rebellion to face its consequence. But God who is for us says, no, I'll give up my only son for you.
[620.80 --> 627.24]  I'll give up my only son for this world corrupted by sin so that you can experience the life that I
[627.24 --> 634.72]  intended for you from the beginning. God is for us. And when Paul looks at what Jesus did on the cross,
[634.98 --> 640.38]  when he looks at the empty tomb, he comes to conclude that God gives all things for us. And there is
[640.38 --> 648.16]  therefore no enemy we face that Jesus has not already defeated by his cross. There's no powers
[648.16 --> 652.92]  of evil. There's no oppressive forces. There's no demonic activity that we need to fear because Jesus
[652.92 --> 659.38]  has already defeated it in the cross. And that same Jesus, Paul says, graciously has given us
[659.38 --> 665.44]  all things. And I want to name for us, I think, a paradox that you probably feel in this passage.
[665.44 --> 670.24]  And that is that Paul talks very openly about oppression, talks about hardship, persecution,
[670.68 --> 676.16]  facing death. I mean, he doesn't give any rose-tainted view of what Christianity is. And yet he has the
[676.16 --> 683.56]  audacity to say, Jesus has in fact given us all things. How can he say that? And it may look, I think,
[683.78 --> 687.38]  and that's true of, I think this is true of Christianity in many cultures, specifically where there's
[687.38 --> 692.82]  persecution. It looks like Christians have nothing, right? They have no protection from the hostility.
[692.82 --> 696.94]  They have no protection from some of the outright persecution. They don't even seem to be privileged
[696.94 --> 703.22]  in any particular way. And yet Paul says, they have all things. What an audacious claim. And when he says
[703.22 --> 707.24]  they have that, I want to just open up briefly the beauty of that. When he says, you have all things,
[707.56 --> 714.18]  the Jesus who came, who died, who resurrected, has given you new relationship with the Father who breathed
[714.18 --> 720.64]  life into you. You now know the living God. You know the one who you were created to live for
[720.64 --> 726.72]  and in communion with. Jesus who died and rose has now grafted you into the family, think about this,
[727.14 --> 732.36]  that has the power of the resurrection through the life of the Spirit. He's given that to us.
[733.24 --> 738.28]  Jesus has now given us the life that will bring us through death into resurrection.
[739.64 --> 744.12]  When it's all said and done, we will not just rot in the ground, but we will, as Jesus has,
[744.12 --> 750.12]  we will resurrect to life forever. And so Paul has the audacity to say, it may not look like you have
[750.12 --> 757.80]  anything, but in Jesus, the resurrected King, you have been given all things. If God is for you,
[758.46 --> 764.44]  who can be against you? No one. And now we get to the second question that Paul asks. He says,
[765.10 --> 770.36]  who shall bring a charge against those whom God has chosen? It's God who justifies.
[770.36 --> 776.00]  Now here we get this law court imagery. If you read Paul, you'll know he often goes to this law
[776.00 --> 780.34]  court imagery. And he gives a pretty staggering and sobering picture. If you read Romans 1 and 2,
[780.94 --> 787.26]  you get the sobering picture of the entire creation, all of humanity rejecting God and choosing to
[787.26 --> 791.98]  worship created things instead of their creator, choosing to chase after idols that cannot speak
[791.98 --> 798.72]  instead of living in good relationship with a living, loving God. And the reality is we now stand trial,
[798.72 --> 805.08]  you might say, against this God who is the judge. And we have no argument, we have no plea, we have no
[805.08 --> 809.86]  clever thing to say that will get us off the hook for the rebellion we have had towards him.
[810.88 --> 818.52]  And into that circumstance, Paul says, good news, church. God's made a verdict. The judge has come
[818.52 --> 826.54]  to his terms and the terms are justified. And the terms are set because God who has graciously given
[826.54 --> 834.86]  us his own son has dealt with the sin, its power and its guilt, and it's defeated the cross and risen
[834.86 --> 843.30]  victorious. And you now by faith share in his victory. The word over the church is justified.
[843.30 --> 849.54]  You've got nothing to fear on that final judgment because Jesus has dealt with it for you. And that
[849.54 --> 857.10]  means, hear this, all the voices of accusation, all the voices that say there's no way this gift could
[857.10 --> 862.26]  be yours, there's no way you are worthy to receive it, those voices are silenced. And maybe I should
[862.26 --> 867.92]  emphasize one voice in particular. The voice of the evil one who loves to turn up in our hearts
[867.92 --> 873.14]  and our imaginations, all of our failures. Who loves in the middle of the night to remind you of
[873.14 --> 879.20]  how much you have fallen, how far you are from the perfection you were created for, how many mistakes
[879.20 --> 884.56]  you've made that make you unworthy of grace. And into those failures, we hear the Father say through
[884.56 --> 891.52]  the work of Jesus, justified. There's an old hymn written by a man named John Newton. He wrote many
[891.52 --> 898.00]  hymns, in fact. And this hymn, I want to read one verse from. It's called, I Hear the Accuser Roar.
[899.28 --> 906.76]  This verse goes, I hear the accuser roar of sins that I have done. I know them all and a thousand more.
[908.06 --> 916.76]  My Jehovah, he knoweth none. Justified. And Paul gets to his third question, which really just builds
[916.76 --> 923.76]  on the second one. He says, who then is the one who can condemn us? No one. Christ Jesus who died,
[923.86 --> 930.84]  more than that, who was raised to life, is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.
[931.58 --> 937.32]  Let me just take that verse in for a second. Christ Jesus who died, more than that, who raised to life,
[937.40 --> 943.50]  is now at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. I love that verse. Not only did
[943.50 --> 949.82]  Jesus go to the cross and defeat the power of sin, its guilt over our lives for us, not only did he rise
[949.82 --> 955.84]  victorious from the grave and give us new resurrection life that animates and gives us new life,
[956.60 --> 963.00]  he in his resurrected body then goes to be with the Father and he begins to intercede for us.
[964.06 --> 968.50]  I mean, what a beautiful picture of the love of Jesus Christ for his world and for the church.
[969.08 --> 972.54]  I mean, right now, he's talking about us. That's what this passage is saying. Jesus,
[972.54 --> 977.44]  he's talking about us to the Father. And it makes me just wonder and ask the question,
[977.52 --> 983.74]  what might he be saying on our behalf to the Father? What ways might he be interceding for us
[983.74 --> 988.58]  where we feel broken and weak and lost? And note this, this might be worth emphasizing,
[988.90 --> 992.98]  he is not interceding to a father who's holding a sledgehammer ready to pulverize us
[992.98 --> 997.90]  for our weaknesses and our shortcomings. He's interceding to a father who sent him in the
[997.90 --> 1003.80]  first place out of love so that we might be liberated from the power of sin, free to live
[1003.80 --> 1011.12]  in his presence, the one who loves us and set us free. And now we get to the fourth question.
[1012.88 --> 1022.04]  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Answer, no one. And it's fair to assume that Paul
[1022.04 --> 1026.92]  asked this question in part, I think, because believers ask that question. He's writing to Christians
[1026.92 --> 1030.36]  who probably think there are many things that could separate them from the love of Christ, right?
[1030.78 --> 1035.26]  There's many enemies, many opponents, many weaknesses, many challenges we face where we think,
[1035.34 --> 1039.46]  well, that just does it. That's going to put a separation between me and Christ. That's going to
[1039.46 --> 1044.58]  cause me to be blocked off from the depth of his grace. And Paul says, I'm going to use every
[1044.58 --> 1050.42]  rhetorical word I have in my disposal to show you how big the love of Jesus is.
[1050.42 --> 1055.62]  And I just want to read this passage again, starting in verse 35. He says,
[1055.70 --> 1062.50]  for I'm convinced, I'm convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,
[1063.48 --> 1069.94]  neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in
[1069.94 --> 1077.96]  all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[1077.96 --> 1082.48]  Lord. It's at this point, church, if you were Pentecostal, you would say amen.
[1084.06 --> 1088.92]  It's quite a list. No powers, no demonic forces, nothing in creation, not even death itself,
[1089.42 --> 1094.98]  not even death itself can separate us from the love of God that is ours in Christ Jesus. It's that
[1094.98 --> 1103.44]  strong, it's that secure, it is that unbreakable. One writer puts it this way. He says, our confidence
[1103.44 --> 1113.06]  as believers is not in our love for Jesus, which is fragile and fickle and limit, our confidence in
[1113.06 --> 1119.44]  His love for us, which is faithful and it is unbreakable. And so to summarize what Paul is
[1119.44 --> 1125.36]  saying to the church, the church that has lots of questions is, number one, God is for you.
[1125.36 --> 1133.26]  The God who put His plan of salvation into action, starting with Abraham, moving all the way to the
[1133.26 --> 1139.24]  cross and the empty tomb, He is for you. And if God can do that and He is for you, you have nothing to
[1139.24 --> 1145.92]  fear. There is no one against you who can stand against the God who has won your victory to the
[1145.92 --> 1153.02]  cross. And if that's true, no one can bring accusations against you. No one can bring condemnation against
[1153.02 --> 1163.10]  you because God has spoken in Jesus and His Word is justified, forgiven, released, renewed, and then
[1163.10 --> 1169.96]  given the life of the resurrection through Jesus Christ. And nothing can separate us from that love.
[1170.80 --> 1174.78]  It is too big. It's too powerful. It is too unbreakable.
[1177.20 --> 1182.40]  And now to go back to where I started this morning, that when we had that conversation with youth,
[1182.40 --> 1189.48]  it was clearly named that trusting God's character is hard, that living in the love of God is
[1189.48 --> 1194.40]  challenging. Knowing that He's for us is a difficult thing in our day-to-day realities. And I think,
[1194.76 --> 1202.88]  can't prove it, I think that what the youth named is what many of us feel. That somehow it's just hard
[1202.88 --> 1207.80]  to trust that the character of God that He's for us. Somehow it's hard to really believe that God in
[1207.80 --> 1215.52]  Christ truly loves us with an unbreakable love. And there's a myriad of reasons for that. I'm only
[1215.52 --> 1219.34]  going to touch on a couple. I think one of them is this. I think for some reason or another, I think
[1219.34 --> 1226.06]  this is, it's deep in the hearts of many believers, that we still see God as this angry, judging God,
[1226.16 --> 1231.86]  holding a mallet ready to pulverize us for the ways we fall short. I think that is very true in the church.
[1231.86 --> 1238.04]  And we still see Jesus, for some reason, as unable to love us. He's almost repulsed by our sin. He's
[1238.04 --> 1243.72]  just so put off by our brokenness, our weakness, our rebellion, our patterns of behavior that we're
[1243.72 --> 1250.04]  ashamed of that He just can't love us. We're too far gone. There's patterns we're so ashamed of that
[1250.04 --> 1256.78]  we just feel He is unable to love us in the way that we actually live our lives. And I think this
[1256.78 --> 1264.16]  passage, to be honest, is an invitation to receive what Paul is saying, that God truly is for us.
[1265.12 --> 1271.94]  That everything He's done is because He loves His world. That the work of Jesus and the cross and the
[1271.94 --> 1279.60]  empty tomb is because He wants to rescue us from the mess that we've created. And that Jesus Himself,
[1279.74 --> 1286.50]  the victorious, resurrected Lord, is not so repulsed by us that we cannot be saved and given grace and
[1286.50 --> 1294.26]  embraced by the strength of His love. I think, I can't prove this, that the reason we're here
[1294.26 --> 1300.36]  is because in some way we have tasted that love. Someone has spoken the gospel to us. We have been
[1300.36 --> 1305.36]  in worship before. We know something of the Bible so much so that we've just got a sense of that love
[1305.36 --> 1309.34]  and we want it. The reason we gather on Sunday morning, the reason we worship is there's something
[1309.34 --> 1314.54]  about Jesus we know is good. The love is deep and we want more of it. Even if we're broken, even if we
[1314.54 --> 1320.22]  feel at a distance from it, we know it's good. And I think when Paul speaks of the love of God,
[1320.80 --> 1325.84]  when he gives all this strong rhetorical language, he's not speaking theoretically. In fact, he's not
[1325.84 --> 1332.18]  interested in just giving us ideas. Paul knows in his own bones that that's true for him. Don't forget
[1332.18 --> 1338.98]  that the person speaking in this passage once upon a time was persecuting Christians. He was chasing
[1338.98 --> 1345.46]  them down with hate, with desires for the demise to imprison and harm them because he so hated the
[1345.46 --> 1353.80]  church. And guess who showed up? The resurrected Jesus. He said, Paul, I've got a plan for you.
[1354.52 --> 1358.94]  I'm going to turn your life upside down. I'm going to reveal the depth of my grace, my mercy, my power.
[1359.04 --> 1363.00]  I'm going to help you see that what happened on the cross and the empty tomb, that changes history
[1363.00 --> 1367.32]  forever, Paul. And I'm now pulling you into my church and you're going to know the depth of my
[1367.32 --> 1373.34]  love. This is why Paul says in Timothy, he says, this is a trustworthy fact that you got to know.
[1373.44 --> 1381.26]  He says, Christ Jesus came into the world to save whom? Sinners, of whom I am the worst.
[1382.08 --> 1388.06]  And Paul then goes on to say, and God through Jesus was so generous and lavished on me his love
[1388.06 --> 1393.82]  and his grace. And when he speaks of the height and the depth and the breadth of God's love,
[1393.94 --> 1399.00]  it's something that he has tasted. And he speaks to a church that's weak because he knows they need
[1399.00 --> 1405.46]  to know how deep and wide and rich is the love of Jesus. And it seems to me that the gift of being
[1405.46 --> 1414.70]  church is that we get the rest of our lives to live in and try to get our heads and our hearts around
[1414.70 --> 1421.50]  the depth of that love. And there's no better Sunday than Resurrection Sunday to say, this is how much
[1421.50 --> 1428.46]  Jesus loves his world. This is how far Jesus goes so that we understand and know and live in relationship
[1428.46 --> 1433.84]  with our loving Father who has found us through the cross, who has given us new life through the
[1433.84 --> 1442.62]  resurrection. Now this week, this sort of reveals how much of a geek I am. I went on this deep dive of
[1442.62 --> 1447.10]  podcast and reading on evidence for the resurrection. Maybe some of you are that kind of person as well.
[1447.16 --> 1452.48]  You just want to read about how the resurrection is historically verifiable. And I just had my mind
[1452.48 --> 1456.82]  as I listened to these two particular people on a podcast, they probably became Christians because
[1456.82 --> 1461.24]  of the evidence for the resurrection. You know, they're scholars and studying. And they actually
[1461.24 --> 1466.32]  shared on these podcasts that no, they did not become Christians through the evidence of the
[1466.32 --> 1470.00]  resurrection. They became Christians through hearing people speak of Jesus, through people's lives that
[1470.00 --> 1474.06]  were transformed by Jesus. They got a sense of the love of Jesus, and it just pulled them in. And what
[1474.06 --> 1479.04]  their study of the resurrection did, it was it gave them evidence and it deepened their faith and their
[1479.04 --> 1484.44]  trust in the depth and the breadth of Jesus' love. I think that's true for many of us. The resurrection
[1484.44 --> 1488.28]  doesn't make much sense to us when we first hear it. And then we get pulled into the church and we think,
[1488.54 --> 1495.02]  whoa, this is how far Jesus goes so that we know the depth and the breadth and the height of his love.
[1495.02 --> 1501.44]  You know, one of the people I was listening to, his name is Robert Barron. He's actually being
[1501.44 --> 1506.44]  interviewed by an atheist. And the atheist was just curious, like, what's this Christian guy got to say
[1506.44 --> 1511.98]  about the gospel? And he asked hard questions about why does Jesus have to die? Why is self-sacrifice
[1511.98 --> 1515.96]  so important? Like, how do we know he rose from the dead? And Robert Barron just had this one line
[1515.96 --> 1520.18]  that just pierced me with the goodness of God. He said, you know, we crucified God.
[1520.18 --> 1526.78]  We, in our rebellion, put Jesus, who is fully God and fully man, we put him on the cross.
[1527.24 --> 1535.22]  I mean, we didn't want this guy. And what did Jesus then do? He came back to life for us in forgiving love.
[1537.80 --> 1544.30]  That's the kind of God we gather to worship. A God who we put on a cross and he returns to us
[1544.30 --> 1552.18]  in resurrecting, forgiving love. A love so powerful, it melts hard hearts generation after
[1552.18 --> 1561.12]  generation, city after city, country after country. We are here as a witness to the power of Jesus' love.
[1561.94 --> 1566.38]  To a resurrected Lord who doesn't just show up to Paul in the first century, who shows up to you
[1566.38 --> 1572.04]  and to me and says, I'm alive. And everything that God has done through me in the cross and the
[1572.04 --> 1578.08]  resurrection, that's for you. So that you can live new lives. So that you can live in the resurrection.
[1578.42 --> 1584.76]  So that when your body dies, it rises back to life the same way my body did and rose back to life.
[1585.22 --> 1594.46]  This is all done out of love. And it seems to me that that love is so big, you can't comprehend it by
[1594.46 --> 1600.92]  yourself. I can't comprehend it by myself. We need the whole church. We need the global church together
[1600.92 --> 1606.96]  over generations to begin to comprehend the depth and the riches and the beauty of the love of Jesus,
[1607.64 --> 1613.18]  which finds us through the death and the resurrection. You know, a passage that I kept
[1613.18 --> 1618.84]  coming back to in my own imagination, a passage that I love, is Ephesians 3. And that is another
[1618.84 --> 1624.66]  place where Paul uses all the language he can muster to help Christians know how big God's love is in
[1624.66 --> 1630.26]  Jesus. And I want to finish my sermon with this. It's a prayer of Paul and he says, now I'm praying for you,
[1630.26 --> 1638.70]  church, that you being rooted and established in love may have power together with all the believers,
[1639.50 --> 1644.42]  all the saints, because you need the whole church to know the love of God. He says, and that you
[1644.42 --> 1650.04]  together may know the depth and the height and the width and the breadth of the love of Jesus. And to
[1650.04 --> 1658.06]  know that this love, it surpasses knowledge so that you may be filled to the full measure of all the
[1658.06 --> 1668.18]  fullness of God. To him be all the glory and the power forever. To start again, or sorry, to finish
[1668.18 --> 1672.52]  where we started this whole series, Jesus says to the church, church in this world, you will have
[1672.52 --> 1687.76]  trouble. But take heart, I have overcome the world. Let's pray. Father, we ask that you give us hearts
[1687.76 --> 1694.82]  that are soft to receive the good news. We pray that in the places where we doubt your love, your power,
[1694.82 --> 1702.92]  your resurrection, that you by your spirit would enable us to believe that you are for us.
[1704.12 --> 1709.94]  And because you finished the work in Jesus, his death and resurrection, we have nothing to fear.
[1711.28 --> 1716.44]  There is no one who can accuse. There is no one who can condemn. There is nothing that can withhold us
[1716.44 --> 1726.56]  from the love of Jesus Christ who is for us. Would you open our hearts to its depth. Would you help us
[1726.56 --> 1732.58]  through the rest of our lives to comprehend its breadth. And would you by your spirit enable us
[1732.58 --> 1737.72]  to receive it for all it is for each and every one of us today and for the rest of our lives.
[1737.72 --> 1742.48]  to Jesus Christ be the glory and the honor. Amen.
[1745.50 --> 1749.76]  When we were planning this service, Jonathan said, I really want to finish with a song of celebration.
[1749.94 --> 1754.00]  I said, absolutely. So let's sing this one. Would you stand and sing with me? There is joy in the house
[1754.00 --> 1754.52]  of the Lord.
