[0.00 → 4.96] Good morning.
[7.06 → 9.58] It's good to be with you this morning.
[11.38 → 19.02] As we continue to look into God's Word and especially focusing in on the story of Jonah,
[19.14 → 26.34] this unusual story of Jonah, one writer described as the story of a religious hypocrite who
[26.34 → 27.16] runs from God.
[27.16 → 30.86] It may be a little hard, but there's some truth to that here.
[31.10 → 35.32] And last week, Pastor Dave left off with Jonah sinking.
[36.70 → 42.68] Looks like he's going to die in the depths, and that's kind of where we left it off.
[42.88 → 49.46] And then, really what we've all been waiting for in spite of Pastor Dave's warnings, we
[49.46 → 50.18] come to this.
[50.18 → 58.40] We're finally dealing with the whale, who is truly the rock star of the story.
[60.14 → 61.86] I'm kind of kidding about that.
[62.00 → 69.52] But God saves Jonah by appointing, and we're going to read a passage where God appoints the
[69.52 → 72.54] whale, the fish, to swallow him.
[72.54 → 75.50] Another picture that I found, there are so many of them.
[76.04 → 79.22] This one's a little more dramatic, a little more intense.
[80.56 → 88.12] Anyway, Jonah literally looks death in the mouth as he swallowed whole.
[88.64 → 90.82] He literally hits rock bottom.
[91.82 → 96.36] Jonah's story has been one of constant descent as we've read it through.
[96.36 → 102.92] He's going down to Joppa, down into a ship, down into the depths, the very depths of the
[102.92 → 105.98] ocean, into the belly of the fish.
[106.56 → 107.96] And that's what we want to talk about this morning.
[108.06 → 109.42] So let's read the passage together.
[109.84 → 114.04] We're going to read from Jonah 1, verse 17 through 2, verse 10.
[114.18 → 115.80] Look at it with me, the word of the Lord.
[117.46 → 120.32] Now the Lord provided a huge fish.
[120.40 → 121.62] This should strike us right away.
[121.68 → 122.76] The Lord provided.
[122.76 → 125.12] There's not my chance.
[125.22 → 126.82] A huge fish to swallow Jonah.
[127.30 → 131.02] And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
[131.90 → 134.94] From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the Lord as God.
[135.02 → 139.34] And he said, in my distress, I called to the Lord, and he answered me.
[140.34 → 144.54] From deep in the realm of the dead, I called for help, and you listened to my cry.
[144.98 → 149.12] You hurled me into the depth, into the very heart of the seas.
[149.12 → 151.56] And the current swirled about me.
[151.56 → 154.76] All your waves and breakers swept over me.
[155.20 → 158.10] I said, I have been banished from your sight.
[158.40 → 161.32] Yet I will look again toward your holy temple.
[162.16 → 163.78] The engulfing waters threatened me.
[163.86 → 165.08] The deep surrounded me.
[165.22 → 167.02] Seaweed was wrapped around my head.
[167.54 → 169.72] To the roots of the mountains I sank down.
[170.02 → 172.60] The earth beneath barred me in forever.
[173.74 → 177.30] But you, Lord my God, brought my life up from the pit.
[177.30 → 183.26] When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, Lord, and my prayers rose to you, to your holy temple.
[184.14 → 187.98] Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God's love for them.
[188.22 → 191.74] But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you.
[192.24 → 193.74] What I have vowed I will make good.
[193.80 → 195.96] I will say, salvation comes from the Lord.
[195.96 → 200.62] And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
[203.92 → 209.62] We might rightly think at this time that Jonah has finally got what's coming to him.
[210.90 → 212.38] I read one quote that said,
[212.38 → 223.54] I like that line.
[223.54 → 226.24] Stripped of his buoyant self-sufficiency.
[227.06 → 228.50] I think we all need that.
[229.02 → 237.58] Only through complete failure could he begin to see and be open to the change and transformation that comes from the Lord.
[237.58 → 243.44] And then the story of rebellion, the story of death, suddenly becomes a story of grace.
[243.76 → 245.16] A story of grace for Jonah.
[245.52 → 247.68] A story of grace for Nineveh.
[247.96 → 249.66] And a story of grace for us.
[250.98 → 255.70] As I said earlier, God had appointed, God had provided this giant fish.
[256.04 → 257.82] And what does Jonah do once he's swallowed?
[257.94 → 258.94] How does he respond?
[259.36 → 261.00] Well, you notice, he prays.
[262.20 → 263.48] Some might say, of course he prays.
[263.52 → 264.60] What else has he got left?
[264.64 → 265.80] And that's probably somewhat true.
[265.80 → 272.50] But this rebellious prophet gets swallowed up by a fish, prays, and then three days later, he is vomited out on shore.
[272.62 → 274.86] And we're supposed to, of course, hopefully you catch it.
[275.00 → 278.14] Three days in the belly of the fish, then life resurrected.
[278.28 → 282.48] We get a bit of a picture there of Jesus in the New Testament.
[283.52 → 286.36] But let's put some context around the book of Jonah.
[286.56 → 292.30] Not just with the book of Jonah, but the other books of the prophet that are around Jonah there.
[292.30 → 295.86] Jonah is one of quite a number of books of the prophets here.
[296.12 → 298.40] People like Amos, Hosea, Jeremiah.
[299.36 → 300.22] We see Israel.
[300.22 → 304.32] Israel, who has been rescued by God.
[304.64 → 306.44] He heard their cry in Egypt.
[306.92 → 307.84] He redeemed them.
[307.96 → 311.34] And he redeems them time and time again when you read your Old Testament.
[312.06 → 313.84] They are given the word, the Torah.
[314.44 → 319.82] They are told how to live with God and how to live one another in this covenant love relationship with God.
[319.82 → 322.78] But they don't live that story out very well.
[323.26 → 324.50] They follow their own ways.
[324.60 → 325.96] In Scripture, it often says that.
[326.24 → 329.70] They went after their own ways, after their own desires, after their own hearts.
[330.18 → 333.34] And ways that lead to sin and brokenness and death.
[334.50 → 338.78] And God then sends prophets to point out this sin and rebellion.
[339.20 → 341.20] To call them back to life.
[342.26 → 344.52] To warn of consequences.
[345.84 → 349.10] The big consequence in the Old Testament was exile to Babylon.
[349.10 → 351.70] You read about that in the prophets there.
[352.14 → 356.86] And again, Judah had fallen into the sin of going their own way.
[356.94 → 358.62] Eventually, they get exiled into Babylon.
[359.28 → 361.36] And they eventually cry out to God again.
[361.70 → 363.56] There is rescue and restoration.
[364.28 → 366.52] Because God hears that cry.
[367.86 → 370.40] Jonah is that same story.
[370.64 → 372.38] Albeit it sounds somewhat different.
[372.38 → 379.42] I see God with the prophets trying to get Israel's and Judah's attention.
[380.22 → 384.66] Trying to get them to see that they aren't choosing the ways of life.
[385.08 → 387.32] I like the story of Hosea.
[387.66 → 392.52] Hosea is told to marry this woman who's really unfaithful to him all the time.
[392.52 → 399.62] And every time she goes and has an affair on him, he's told to go and find her again and bring her home and build a marriage.
[400.70 → 403.00] And God says, that's me, Israel.
[403.26 → 404.86] That's me with you.
[405.84 → 407.76] You keep messing around on me.
[407.98 → 412.96] And I keep coming back to bring you into a real genuine love relationship.
[414.26 → 415.58] I'm going to read a little bit out of Hosea.
[415.70 → 419.28] Notice, again, this context that we find Jonah in.
[419.28 → 421.54] Hosea 8, look at it with me.
[422.92 → 424.62] Where it says, put the trumpet to your lips.
[425.02 → 426.74] An eagle is over the house of the Lord.
[427.10 → 433.26] Because the people have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law.
[433.58 → 435.90] And please don't read law as rules.
[436.40 → 438.66] Law is ways of living well.
[438.86 → 440.04] Okay, that's what I want you to hear.
[440.40 → 444.02] And Israel cries out to me, our God, we acknowledge you.
[444.72 → 446.92] But Israel has rejected what is good.
[447.28 → 449.08] An enemy will pursue him.
[450.08 → 451.70] They set up kings without my consent.
[451.86 → 453.60] They choose princes without my approval.
[454.06 → 456.14] With their silver and gold that they depend on, right?
[456.36 → 459.52] They make idols for themselves to their own destruction.
[459.74 → 461.12] Because that's what happens.
[462.14 → 463.64] Israel, and here, now hear this well.
[464.00 → 465.92] Israel is swallowed up.
[467.16 → 468.12] Israel is swallowed up.
[468.20 → 468.74] Think of Jonah.
[468.74 → 473.50] Now she is among the nations like something no one wants.
[473.50 → 478.88] For they have gone up to Assyria like wild donkeys wandering alone.
[479.02 → 483.20] Ephraim, which is one of the tribes, has sold herself to lovers.
[483.66 → 488.28] Although they have sold themselves among the nations, I will now gather them together.
[488.28 → 491.96] And you see this God who consistently does the same thing over and over again.
[492.24 → 493.36] The people go their own way.
[493.60 → 495.90] They try to live life outside the ways that God intends.
[496.10 → 496.96] It goes poorly.
[497.20 → 497.84] It's a mess.
[497.94 → 499.06] All kinds of horrible things happen.
[499.38 → 501.14] And God says, okay, do you get it now?
[501.24 → 501.96] Now come here.
[503.00 → 504.20] Come and be with me.
[504.86 → 506.64] Jonah is that same story.
[508.02 → 509.18] It's that same story.
[509.18 → 510.72] Look at Jeremiah.
[511.26 → 513.06] Jeremiah 51, 34.
[513.66 → 515.44] You can read the book on your own sometime.
[515.68 → 517.40] But Nebuchadnezzar is the king of Babylon.
[518.30 → 521.84] And they are going to be the ones who take Judah into captivity.
[522.62 → 524.64] Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, has devoured us.
[524.72 → 526.18] He has thrown us into confusion.
[526.66 → 528.64] He has made us an empty jar.
[528.94 → 529.62] And here we go again.
[529.84 → 532.36] Like a serpent, he has swallowed us.
[533.26 → 535.56] And filled his stomach with our delicacies.
[535.92 → 537.18] And then has spewed us out.
[537.18 → 539.38] And we see that same picture again.
[539.70 → 542.84] Being swallowed up by that which harms us.
[543.68 → 545.60] That which isn't good for us.
[546.48 → 547.36] And we're broken.
[548.66 → 550.66] Sin drowns us.
[551.72 → 553.20] It swallows us up.
[553.58 → 554.80] It spews us out.
[556.68 → 557.74] You ever felt that way?
[560.30 → 561.46] Jonah had run.
[562.88 → 565.74] He was going to be free on his terms.
[565.74 → 570.84] And then it all catches up to him with his selfishness and his sin.
[571.28 → 574.52] And then he goes down, down, deep into the sea, into the belly of the fish.
[574.80 → 578.54] Which ironically is his place of rescue.
[578.54 → 583.24] He is rescued by the fish.
[584.00 → 587.16] Literally, in the sense that he got swallowed up and then doesn't drown in the sea.
[587.92 → 589.42] The fish is supposed to be here.
[589.46 → 593.32] The belly of the fish is supposed to be a place of potential grace and transformation.
[594.90 → 596.88] It's places we all need to get into.
[596.88 → 601.90] I was reading a book on Jonah written by Eugene Peterson.
[602.18 → 605.42] He's the author of the version of the Bible called The Message.
[606.32 → 607.88] And he talks about ascesis.
[609.16 → 614.32] This is the practice of severe religious discipline.
[614.84 → 616.08] Often self-imposed.
[616.08 → 620.32] Pastor Dave talked about severe mercy coming to us.
[621.74 → 627.94] And how we need this because we are constantly being seduced to be as God.
[628.18 → 629.38] Adam and Eve's original sin.
[629.78 → 630.80] You want to eat the fruit.
[630.88 → 631.06] Why?
[631.16 → 632.58] Well, then you'll be like God.
[632.72 → 636.52] And we'll have this tendency to want to be like God.
[636.82 → 638.26] Run the show ourselves.
[638.62 → 639.44] Be rebellious.
[639.70 → 640.64] Do what we want.
[640.64 → 642.84] And God better just like it.
[642.84 → 653.96] And places like the belly of the beast reminds us clearly that we are not God.
[655.88 → 657.50] We see it all throughout Scripture.
[658.36 → 659.40] I'm thinking of Jacob.
[660.04 → 662.28] Jacob who has this dysfunctional family.
[662.62 → 663.66] And you can read all about it.
[664.02 → 665.08] Jacob, one of the patriarchs.
[665.20 → 667.80] And he had all this dysfunction.
[667.80 → 669.72] And his brother wants to kill him.
[669.88 → 670.92] So he runs away.
[670.92 → 672.40] He's running away.
[672.52 → 675.12] And he falls asleep on a rock on the ground.
[675.20 → 676.44] He has this vision from God.
[676.88 → 677.56] And he wakes up.
[678.00 → 679.60] We read in Genesis 28.
[680.12 → 681.88] When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought,
[682.34 → 683.64] Surely the Lord is in this place.
[684.06 → 685.24] And I was not aware of it.
[685.48 → 686.60] And I really like that.
[687.02 → 691.08] Because God is in the place of Jacob's dysfunction.
[692.54 → 694.62] He's in the place of his messiness.
[695.66 → 697.40] And I think of Jonah as well.
[697.40 → 704.86] God shows up in the belly of the fish in a way that Jonah might finally understand.
[705.64 → 708.80] And will be in a place where he can hear what God wants to say to him.
[709.36 → 714.60] In his time of trouble, Jonah meets God face to face.
[715.86 → 717.00] We see that with Abraham.
[717.46 → 720.36] And David when he's in the caves and the king wants to kill him.
[720.56 → 721.30] Elijah, Peter.
[721.30 → 721.90] Peter.
[721.90 → 724.64] All of these leaders, they grow in the face of adversity.
[725.08 → 726.02] In the face of failure.
[726.36 → 727.34] In the face of suffering.
[728.58 → 732.62] Because it's only and often only when things fall apart.
[732.90 → 735.88] Only when our schemes and our resources are broken and exhausted.
[736.20 → 742.70] That we are finally in a place where we are open to see how we are dependent on God.
[742.70 → 750.64] As is often said, you never realize that Jesus is all you need.
[751.10 → 752.72] Until Jesus is all you have.
[755.44 → 757.78] Jesus says it this way in Matthew 10.39.
[758.06 → 761.38] He says, whoever finds their life will lose it.
[761.44 → 765.76] Whoever defines life on their own terms and thinks that's going to work.
[765.92 → 766.86] It's not going to work.
[766.98 → 767.84] They will lose it.
[768.36 → 769.06] And then he goes on.
[769.14 → 770.48] But whoever loses their lives.
[770.70 → 771.78] In other words, gives up control.
[771.86 → 772.22] Surrenders.
[772.22 → 774.94] Whoever loses their lives for my sake will find it.
[777.16 → 778.90] That's what this story is telling us.
[781.52 → 785.34] Life happens when we trust the creator and his ways.
[787.40 → 790.30] And I guess I might ask you, because I've asked myself this week as I prepared.
[790.72 → 794.62] What God illusions and God delusions do I need to die to?
[796.72 → 797.88] I don't know if I have any.
[798.06 → 798.54] You do.
[800.42 → 800.98] You do.
[800.98 → 801.00] You do.
[802.22 → 807.10] I depend completely on my smarts, my intelligence.
[807.10 → 810.90] I'm going to depend completely on how strong I am, how self-sufficient I am.
[811.22 → 815.60] And again, nothing wrong with working hard and taking care of things and doing your part.
[815.84 → 819.54] But we get the illusion that somehow we are in control.
[819.54 → 824.04] And that is the illusion and the delusion that we fall into so easily.
[824.04 → 826.66] Jonah doesn't simply need to descend.
[826.66 → 828.50] He needs to surrender.
[828.50 → 830.88] He needs to die to himself.
[830.88 → 836.82] And so he finally prays in his containment.
[836.82 → 839.56] One writer described it this way.
[839.56 → 843.94] The action, the story of Jonah is about to come to a full halt.
[843.94 → 845.20] It's going to stop completely.
[845.20 → 845.54] Where?
[845.54 → 850.48] To leave Jonah alone with his God.
[850.48 → 853.86] You have ever been to that place?
[853.86 → 857.74] Where you're just alone with God.
[857.74 → 858.54] You've got nothing.
[859.66 → 862.52] You're just alone with your God.
[863.14 → 864.44] You thought you were alone.
[865.30 → 866.80] And you discovered God is there.
[867.08 → 875.36] In this season of askesis, of severe mercy, the season of hardship, the season of pain, season of confusion, season of suffering, season of depression.
[875.36 → 878.82] When you are alone with your God, how do you respond?
[882.68 → 883.16] Pray.
[884.48 → 885.36] Do you surrender?
[887.04 → 889.68] Are you willing to learn to die to yourself?
[889.98 → 897.48] Being pulled out of your God delusion or God denial, where God intensity begins to replace your self-absorption?
[898.72 → 901.84] Some of the best writing in the New Testament was written by Paul when he was in prison.
[901.84 → 905.96] Or John when he was exiled on the island of Patmos and wrote the book of Revelations.
[906.32 → 910.22] Or I think of Martin Luther King in Birmingham prison writing some amazing stuff.
[910.32 → 914.18] Or Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the gulags of the former Soviet Union.
[917.94 → 919.22] Da Vinci said this.
[920.94 → 928.02] He said, art, and I'm going to use the word here, art, to refer to this creative capacity we hold.
[928.48 → 931.60] I'm not talking just about doing paintings or sculpture or anything like that.
[931.84 → 937.98] Art breathes from containments and suffocates from freedom.
[941.56 → 942.98] I know that's a little unfair.
[943.14 → 945.68] I had a whole week to kind of stew on that.
[947.36 → 949.48] I'll leave it with you to stew on.
[950.88 → 953.46] Art needs containment.
[954.28 → 958.20] It suffocates from anything and everything.
[958.20 → 959.96] When I'm focused.
[959.96 → 961.90] Art is a focused process.
[962.26 → 966.42] When I want to create, I need to have somehow a container of some sort.
[967.44 → 968.32] That's kind of what it's saying.
[968.68 → 969.26] Revelation.
[969.62 → 970.54] Words from God.
[970.92 → 973.30] Are given in the confinement of a cell.
[973.54 → 974.94] Or the belly of the fish.
[975.24 → 977.02] Or the brokenness of life.
[977.02 → 977.58] God.
[977.58 → 977.68] God.
[980.68 → 987.02] And these times can reveal very, very clearly that we aren't God.
[987.02 → 990.82] aren't in control
[990.82 → 994.42] and we need to experience God's presence
[994.42 → 997.68] in the midst of that broken, messy space
[997.68 → 1000.94] and maybe especially in that space
[1000.94 → 1005.14] where we desperately need God and his salvation
[1005.14 → 1008.02] and not our poor substitutes.
[1010.48 → 1013.44] Jonah, I'm going to grab my water a second.
[1017.02 → 1022.62] Jonah is in that place.
[1023.76 → 1026.56] He's in that place, that confinement.
[1027.52 → 1030.58] And he's in that place because of his poor choices.
[1031.98 → 1033.92] That's not always the way it is.
[1034.08 → 1035.58] So hear me well here.
[1036.14 → 1037.22] I think of Daniel.
[1038.72 → 1040.62] Daniel was a man of God.
[1041.74 → 1044.32] Judah and him, they got caught up in captivity,
[1044.52 → 1045.10] taken to Babylon.
[1045.10 → 1048.44] It wasn't Daniel's poor choices.
[1048.62 → 1051.22] It was probably his parents or their parents' poor choices
[1051.22 → 1052.54] that caused Israel to be taken.
[1053.42 → 1056.30] And sometimes you just get swallowed up by life,
[1056.66 → 1059.26] disease, economic, war.
[1060.60 → 1062.06] And you have no idea why you're in the belly.
[1064.22 → 1065.66] I'm not here to answer why.
[1065.66 → 1071.84] I think a lot of poor things get said
[1071.84 → 1073.48] when we try to figure out the why.
[1075.06 → 1076.74] Rather, I want to encourage you
[1076.74 → 1078.92] to sit with your God
[1078.92 → 1082.90] and pray and learn to depend on him
[1082.90 → 1085.08] in that space.
[1087.56 → 1089.40] In verse 2 in our passage today,
[1089.44 → 1089.56] it says,
[1089.70 → 1091.68] from inside the fish, Jonah prayed, right?
[1091.68 → 1092.44] From him.
[1092.52 → 1094.10] That's where he learned to depend on God
[1094.10 → 1094.98] in a way he hadn't before.
[1095.46 → 1096.64] Jonah cries out.
[1096.88 → 1097.40] Can you relate?
[1097.66 → 1099.24] Sometimes all you can do is cry out.
[1100.42 → 1102.22] That's a good space to be in.
[1103.20 → 1105.06] It's not a fun space to be in.
[1106.18 → 1108.56] Life is sometimes too hard, too confusing.
[1108.94 → 1110.04] But let me say again,
[1110.32 → 1111.26] cry out repeatedly.
[1111.42 → 1111.62] Why?
[1111.84 → 1113.26] Because the Lord hears those cries
[1113.26 → 1115.52] and he answers into the space with you.
[1116.48 → 1118.12] Jonah cries out and comes to realize
[1118.12 → 1119.96] God is there in the belly of the fish.
[1119.96 → 1122.88] All he thought was there was seaweed and stuff.
[1125.72 → 1127.18] A lot of things Jonah says
[1127.18 → 1128.50] comes out of the Psalms.
[1128.56 → 1129.66] If you're ever struggling to pray,
[1129.96 → 1131.32] the Psalms is a good place
[1131.32 → 1132.42] to gather real prayer.
[1133.38 → 1135.44] Psalm 139, the psalmist writes this.
[1138.92 → 1139.74] The psalmist says,
[1139.82 → 1141.28] if I go up to the heavens, you're there.
[1141.56 → 1143.60] If I make my bed in the depths, you are there.
[1143.88 → 1145.30] If I go to the place of shale,
[1145.74 → 1147.14] the place of the dead,
[1147.44 → 1148.44] you're there.
[1148.44 → 1148.52] You're there.
[1149.96 → 1154.02] Jonah looks back with clarity.
[1154.66 → 1155.74] He looks back at the story.
[1156.18 → 1158.16] We know the sailors threw him in.
[1158.48 → 1159.50] Notice what Jonah said.
[1159.82 → 1162.02] You hurled me into the sea.
[1163.38 → 1164.70] Notice whose waves they are.
[1165.02 → 1166.34] They're your waves.
[1166.34 → 1166.96] Jonah's.
[1166.96 → 1173.30] Jonah, who was so angry at God's stupid plan
[1173.30 → 1174.90] to save these Ninevite's,
[1175.16 → 1177.16] he was so angry he ran away from that,
[1177.48 → 1180.20] now experiences God's mercy and God's grace
[1180.20 → 1182.02] in a way he never had before.
[1186.04 → 1186.98] He prays.
[1186.98 → 1189.84] Much of it from the Psalms.
[1189.84 → 1193.10] We would expect, given his circumstances,
[1193.28 → 1194.76] that his would be a prayer of lament.
[1196.08 → 1198.18] And his prayer is kicked off by his circumstances,
[1198.46 → 1200.78] but it's not reduced to those circumstances.
[1201.72 → 1201.78] Right?
[1202.20 → 1204.06] And I think of Paul, who writes,
[1204.16 → 1206.16] I've learned the secret of being content
[1206.16 → 1207.38] in all circumstances,
[1207.82 → 1209.90] in bad ones and in good circumstances.
[1209.90 → 1213.20] Because the presence of God
[1213.20 → 1214.92] was he found in all those moments.
[1217.22 → 1219.24] Jonah's prayer took him into a world
[1219.24 → 1221.18] far bigger than his immediate circumstance.
[1221.64 → 1224.20] Sometimes we get so absorbed into our circumstance.
[1224.54 → 1225.30] Oh, look at the problem.
[1225.36 → 1225.80] Look at the problem.
[1225.86 → 1226.28] Look at the problem.
[1226.34 → 1226.82] Look at the problem.
[1227.56 → 1229.50] And we fail to see God is there
[1229.50 → 1230.90] in the midst of the problem.
[1232.28 → 1233.38] And then we cry out.
[1233.68 → 1235.06] We pour ourselves up before God.
[1235.46 → 1237.12] And as we deepen our awareness
[1237.12 → 1238.64] of God's presence in each moment,
[1238.64 → 1241.32] then we are drawn away from ourselves,
[1242.12 → 1244.08] our needs, our gratitude, ourselves.
[1245.08 → 1246.72] And we are pulled into adoration
[1246.72 → 1247.88] for this God who is ever-present.
[1248.30 → 1249.64] And I've seen that in people who,
[1250.86 → 1251.54] when hardship,
[1251.76 → 1253.28] because we all have hardship,
[1253.62 → 1254.72] when hardship happens,
[1255.00 → 1257.30] some people somehow grow deeper in their faith
[1257.30 → 1259.26] and in their walk and in their life
[1259.26 → 1261.76] because they are getting out of themselves.
[1262.26 → 1262.70] They're not saying,
[1262.78 → 1263.82] oh, look at me, the victim.
[1263.82 → 1264.00] Oh, look at me, the victim.
[1264.00 → 1269.28] I find God at the moment.
[1270.44 → 1270.88] How?
[1271.00 → 1271.58] I don't know.
[1272.80 → 1274.52] I know I have found it in my moments.
[1276.52 → 1277.32] We cry out.
[1280.52 → 1282.02] And notice where Jonah's focus goes.
[1282.44 → 1283.80] It goes to the temple,
[1284.10 → 1285.32] the place of God's presence.
[1286.18 → 1288.68] At first he speaks about sinking into the netherworld,
[1289.02 → 1290.86] a world that seems so far from God.
[1290.86 → 1293.40] And then he finds that God is down there with him.
[1294.70 → 1298.56] And he stands condemned with nothing to offer.
[1299.82 → 1300.46] Nothing.
[1302.70 → 1305.02] It made me think of lines of a hymn.
[1306.06 → 1306.98] It says,
[1307.40 → 1308.96] Not the labour of my hands
[1308.96 → 1311.08] can fulfill the law's demands.
[1311.82 → 1313.68] Could my zeal no respite no?
[1313.94 → 1315.44] Could my tears forever flow?
[1316.00 → 1318.26] All for sin could not atone.
[1318.26 → 1320.30] Thou must save,
[1321.34 → 1322.04] and thou alone.
[1325.36 → 1326.70] And Jonah sees the temple,
[1327.84 → 1329.10] and he sees God's holiness,
[1329.70 → 1331.22] and he knows only God,
[1331.30 → 1332.34] by his grace and power,
[1332.42 → 1333.46] can pull him out of the pit.
[1334.42 → 1337.66] We cannot save ourselves,
[1338.16 → 1340.38] and we need saving.
[1342.48 → 1344.02] Read in Hebrews 10, 10,
[1344.02 → 1345.62] by that will,
[1345.68 → 1346.14] by God's will.
[1346.22 → 1347.56] We have been made holy.
[1348.04 → 1350.04] We have been made holy
[1350.04 → 1352.98] through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ
[1352.98 → 1354.52] once for all.
[1356.60 → 1359.38] We know grace only when we know
[1359.38 → 1361.04] we come empty-handed.
[1361.04 → 1365.08] I think some of us tend to want to come to God
[1365.08 → 1365.82] thinking,
[1366.00 → 1367.56] Well, we need some grace.
[1368.66 → 1369.34] Some of it.
[1369.86 → 1371.24] We need a little bit of grace,
[1371.60 → 1374.52] because we're actually pulling our own weight almost.
[1375.72 → 1376.94] And the answer is,
[1377.32 → 1378.06] you've got nothing.
[1380.26 → 1380.66] Nothing.
[1382.72 → 1385.62] We are utterly incapable of saving ourselves.
[1386.34 → 1386.92] And with Jonah,
[1387.02 → 1388.48] we say salvation comes from the Lord.
[1388.80 → 1389.60] And this is why
[1389.60 → 1391.32] we don't often find grace
[1391.32 → 1392.34] at the high points in life,
[1392.40 → 1393.82] but often in the valleys and the depths.
[1394.14 → 1395.94] And I realize we should find grace everywhere.
[1396.24 → 1397.08] And I realize that,
[1397.12 → 1397.24] you know,
[1397.26 → 1398.24] I can be in the mountaintops,
[1398.28 → 1399.54] and I can look at life,
[1399.58 → 1400.94] and I can feel really great
[1400.94 → 1402.06] about how God has blessed me.
[1402.08 → 1403.38] And that's totally true.
[1403.68 → 1404.62] But too often,
[1404.84 → 1406.20] there's a little voice in the background
[1406.20 → 1406.66] that says,
[1406.94 → 1408.06] Wow, look what I've done.
[1409.74 → 1410.10] Whew.
[1411.58 → 1412.12] Oh, man,
[1412.18 → 1413.26] look at all those good things I've done.
[1413.32 → 1413.46] Whew.
[1413.90 → 1414.72] I'm pretty good.
[1415.62 → 1416.50] I'm pretty successful.
[1416.60 → 1417.00] I'm pretty this.
[1417.06 → 1417.40] I'm pretty that.
[1417.64 → 1419.32] And it's in the pits.
[1419.44 → 1421.50] It's in the belly of the fish
[1421.50 → 1422.44] where we realize
[1422.44 → 1426.04] that we need God.
[1427.80 → 1429.32] And then we say with Jonah,
[1429.68 → 1431.76] you lift me from the pit.
[1432.56 → 1433.66] Never lift myself.
[1435.10 → 1437.56] And then the real deliverance of the story
[1437.56 → 1438.40] is that.
[1439.06 → 1439.88] Jonah realized
[1439.88 → 1441.90] God is the one who brings salvation.
[1441.90 → 1444.88] And it's not the release from the fish
[1444.88 → 1447.08] that actually is his moment of deliverance.
[1447.72 → 1448.76] That comes in the belly.
[1450.46 → 1451.34] Jonah could have died there,
[1451.40 → 1452.30] and it would have been a great ending
[1452.30 → 1452.98] to the story too.
[1456.12 → 1456.80] Too often,
[1456.92 → 1458.08] we picture a God
[1458.08 → 1458.88] whose job it is
[1458.88 → 1460.16] to make things smooth for us.
[1461.04 → 1461.18] You know,
[1461.20 → 1462.00] give us smooth sailing.
[1462.20 → 1462.56] Comfort.
[1462.76 → 1463.08] Security.
[1463.46 → 1464.12] It's guaranteed.
[1464.12 → 1466.00] If we view God's greatest job
[1466.00 → 1467.30] is to make us comfortable
[1467.30 → 1467.86] and happy
[1467.86 → 1469.02] in a broken world,
[1469.24 → 1469.56] you know what?
[1469.62 → 1470.38] We fail to see
[1470.38 → 1471.90] how God reveals himself in Scripture.
[1473.26 → 1473.98] In Scripture,
[1474.50 → 1475.98] God's highest priority
[1475.98 → 1478.26] is to call people to himself
[1478.26 → 1479.82] and to mould their character
[1479.82 → 1481.38] into the likeness of his son Jesus
[1481.38 → 1483.20] so they reflect his image well.
[1484.08 → 1486.64] That's God's greatest call on your life.
[1486.64 → 1490.16] So yeah.
[1492.66 → 1493.74] We'll find ourselves
[1493.74 → 1495.08] in the belly of the beast sometimes.
[1496.32 → 1497.92] And hopefully in that space,
[1498.04 → 1500.46] you'll find that you are undone.
[1502.36 → 1504.18] I love how Isaiah describes that
[1504.18 → 1506.36] when he has a vision of seeing God
[1506.36 → 1509.34] and he really sees God.
[1509.98 → 1510.70] And he says,
[1510.90 → 1511.24] he says,
[1511.42 → 1512.40] woe is me,
[1512.48 → 1513.32] I am undone,
[1513.46 → 1515.56] for I have seen the eyes of God
[1515.56 → 1516.98] and I have seen God
[1516.98 → 1518.28] and I'm a sinful man.
[1518.54 → 1519.68] He said,
[1519.76 → 1520.60] I am undone.
[1520.72 → 1521.84] That's the point.
[1526.92 → 1528.22] Where self-sufficiency
[1528.22 → 1529.08] is out the window.
[1531.12 → 1531.88] I don't know about you,
[1532.64 → 1533.84] but my greatest growth
[1533.84 → 1535.24] has taken place
[1535.24 → 1536.86] when I found myself
[1536.86 → 1537.86] in the belly of the beast.
[1540.64 → 1541.66] I think of times
[1541.66 → 1543.80] where life was really hard
[1543.80 → 1545.64] or stuck in depression
[1545.64 → 1549.66] or I developed panic attacks
[1549.66 → 1550.50] and I didn't know what to do.
[1552.04 → 1553.36] Had a bit of mental breakdown.
[1553.50 → 1554.18] All those things.
[1554.98 → 1555.36] Ironically,
[1555.46 → 1556.26] these were my moments
[1556.26 → 1557.04] of greatest growth.
[1557.22 → 1557.52] How?
[1558.56 → 1558.82] How?
[1558.92 → 1559.08] Well,
[1559.78 → 1560.48] in those moments,
[1560.62 → 1563.34] I had to step aside
[1563.34 → 1564.82] and just let God be God in my life
[1564.82 → 1566.14] and learn to trust in him.
[1568.30 → 1569.14] At some points,
[1569.24 → 1570.26] we all need to learn that.
[1570.26 → 1572.04] We need to learn that
[1572.04 → 1573.26] getting what we wanted
[1573.26 → 1574.90] isn't going to bring us
[1574.90 → 1575.90] to life we really need.
[1578.24 → 1579.24] And so in some ways,
[1580.24 → 1581.68] I hesitate to say it this way,
[1581.72 → 1582.14] but somehow,
[1582.60 → 1583.52] I can say it for myself,
[1583.64 → 1585.04] thank God for the belly of the fish.
[1585.04 → 1592.34] Now,
[1592.80 → 1594.02] let me back up a bit.
[1595.02 → 1596.06] When I look at verse 8,
[1597.40 → 1598.58] Jonah talking about,
[1599.52 → 1602.12] he's all excited about God.
[1602.96 → 1603.48] But then he said,
[1603.56 → 1605.18] those who cling to worthless idols
[1605.18 → 1607.38] turn away from God's love for them,
[1607.90 → 1608.30] but I,
[1608.36 → 1609.42] with shouts of grateful praise,
[1609.48 → 1610.46] will sacrifice to you.
[1610.46 → 1614.54] And Jonah rightly says
[1614.54 → 1615.58] that idolatry
[1615.58 → 1616.56] blocks people
[1616.56 → 1618.08] from receiving God's grace and love.
[1618.74 → 1619.20] And that's true.
[1621.12 → 1623.06] But Jonah has not yet
[1623.06 → 1624.28] fully grasped
[1624.28 → 1625.78] the depth
[1625.78 → 1626.62] and the magnitude
[1626.62 → 1627.64] of God's grace,
[1628.36 → 1629.16] although he should have.
[1630.80 → 1631.88] Jonah should have been saying,
[1632.00 → 1632.74] wow, look at me,
[1632.94 → 1633.84] what a mess I am.
[1634.32 → 1634.82] Oh, man.
[1635.12 → 1635.36] He should,
[1635.42 → 1635.94] at this moment,
[1636.02 → 1636.36] he should have said,
[1636.50 → 1637.46] I cannot wait
[1638.10 → 1639.46] to get to Nineveh.
[1640.46 → 1641.90] and share
[1641.90 → 1643.10] what God has done in me.
[1644.04 → 1645.06] But instead he says,
[1645.14 → 1645.92] well, those folks,
[1646.02 → 1646.58] those pagans
[1646.58 → 1647.22] with their idols,
[1647.38 → 1649.98] they don't get it.
[1653.22 → 1654.00] And he fails
[1654.00 → 1654.80] to comprehend
[1654.80 → 1657.64] his subtle idolatry.
[1659.42 → 1660.34] Where somehow,
[1660.68 → 1662.36] Dave talked about it
[1662.36 → 1663.18] in one of his messages,
[1664.34 → 1665.60] they're God's chosen people, right?
[1665.94 → 1667.24] And he's still got some work
[1667.24 → 1668.66] to do in that whole area there.
[1668.66 → 1670.40] He's so glad
[1670.40 → 1671.40] to receive grace,
[1671.68 → 1672.64] but he has a lot
[1672.64 → 1673.38] to learn yet
[1673.38 → 1675.00] about giving it back,
[1675.68 → 1676.90] especially to those around him,
[1676.94 → 1677.56] especially to those
[1677.56 → 1678.12] who are messy.
[1679.32 → 1680.04] Too often,
[1680.82 → 1682.32] too often I see this
[1682.32 → 1683.58] around me
[1683.58 → 1684.04] in churches
[1684.04 → 1684.80] and people
[1684.80 → 1685.64] who love the Lord,
[1686.38 → 1687.30] but somehow they fail
[1687.30 → 1687.76] to see
[1687.76 → 1688.58] that the grace
[1688.58 → 1689.38] that comes to them
[1689.38 → 1691.00] should be shared
[1691.00 → 1692.06] to those around them.
[1693.28 → 1694.44] God releases Jonah
[1694.44 → 1695.08] from the fish,
[1695.18 → 1695.40] and then,
[1695.60 → 1696.20] even though Jonah
[1696.20 → 1697.38] still has much to learn.
[1699.06 → 1700.28] That's good news
[1700.28 → 1701.22] in a weird way.
[1702.56 → 1702.76] I mean,
[1702.78 → 1703.24] I wish Jonah
[1703.24 → 1703.92] had grown up more.
[1704.92 → 1705.66] But it's good news
[1705.66 → 1706.42] in a weird way
[1706.42 → 1707.38] in that it's good
[1707.38 → 1708.42] to know that God
[1708.42 → 1710.60] works with slow learners.
[1713.18 → 1713.88] How many of you
[1713.88 → 1715.10] are a slow learner?
[1717.60 → 1718.26] Me, too.
[1719.12 → 1719.74] Hi, I'm Sid.
[1719.80 → 1720.36] I'm a slow learner.
[1720.36 → 1721.16] Right?
[1723.44 → 1723.56] You know,
[1723.58 → 1725.14] sometimes it takes time,
[1725.20 → 1725.30] right?
[1725.34 → 1726.96] We don't even see
[1726.96 → 1728.48] all the messiness
[1728.48 → 1729.30] that makes us
[1729.30 → 1729.96] who we are,
[1730.34 → 1731.70] and that has to be undone.
[1732.64 → 1733.66] We have still
[1733.66 → 1734.68] so much to learn,
[1734.98 → 1736.52] yet God still loves Jonah,
[1736.74 → 1737.88] still wants to use Jonah,
[1738.00 → 1739.00] still challenges him
[1739.00 → 1740.48] to display grace
[1740.48 → 1741.04] and mercy
[1741.04 → 1742.24] and to accept it
[1742.24 → 1742.86] and live it out.
[1745.20 → 1746.54] I can't tell you
[1746.54 → 1747.22] how God is working
[1747.22 → 1747.84] in your life.
[1747.84 → 1750.08] I can just assure you
[1750.08 → 1750.66] that he is.
[1751.92 → 1752.68] And you may be
[1752.68 → 1753.60] experiencing time
[1753.60 → 1754.48] in the belly of the fish
[1754.48 → 1755.60] in your life right now,
[1756.16 → 1757.80] or you will be soon.
[1759.14 → 1759.86] Know this.
[1761.20 → 1762.02] God is there.
[1763.12 → 1763.90] He's with you.
[1764.92 → 1766.06] He is present,
[1766.68 → 1767.54] and he is at work
[1767.54 → 1768.16] in you
[1768.16 → 1769.34] and through you
[1769.34 → 1770.74] and in spite of you,
[1770.90 → 1771.92] and he loves you,
[1772.00 → 1772.76] and he works with you
[1772.76 → 1773.48] always.
[1775.66 → 1776.46] Count on that.
[1776.46 → 1778.18] Count on that.
[1778.96 → 1779.74] And then go out
[1779.74 → 1780.28] and live your life
[1780.28 → 1781.74] with eyes wide open.
[1782.34 → 1782.80] Let's pray.
[1786.70 → 1787.30] Lord God,
[1787.34 → 1788.12] we come before you
[1788.12 → 1788.70] and we just want
[1788.70 → 1789.18] to thank you
[1789.18 → 1790.36] for being such
[1790.36 → 1791.68] an abundantly loving,
[1791.92 → 1792.24] gracious,
[1792.50 → 1793.20] merciful God.
[1794.20 → 1794.98] We thank you
[1794.98 → 1795.98] that you show up
[1795.98 → 1797.64] in places
[1797.64 → 1798.76] of brokenness,
[1798.88 → 1799.40] in the belly
[1799.40 → 1800.02] of the fish,
[1800.16 → 1801.32] in the brokenness
[1801.32 → 1802.02] of our lives.
[1802.40 → 1802.92] Sometimes it's
[1802.92 → 1804.08] our own stupid fault,
[1804.18 → 1805.02] and yet you show up.
[1805.02 → 1806.24] Sometimes we're
[1806.24 → 1807.14] victims of things,
[1807.20 → 1808.36] and still you show up.
[1809.26 → 1809.94] Sometimes we're just
[1809.94 → 1810.96] swallowed by life,
[1811.04 → 1811.62] and it hurts,
[1812.62 → 1813.72] and you're still there.
[1815.04 → 1815.34] Lord,
[1815.40 → 1815.98] may we learn
[1815.98 → 1816.90] to depend on you.
[1817.00 → 1817.90] May we also learn
[1817.90 → 1818.60] to be gracious
[1818.60 → 1819.38] like you,
[1820.04 → 1820.76] so that we may
[1820.76 → 1821.80] display your love
[1821.80 → 1822.28] and your grace
[1822.28 → 1823.10] to those around us.
[1824.08 → 1824.58] Forgive us,
[1824.74 → 1824.80] Lord,
[1824.86 → 1825.76] when we don't,
[1826.06 → 1826.56] and help us
[1826.56 → 1827.82] as slow learners
[1827.82 → 1829.12] to learn more and more
[1829.12 → 1829.96] that we need
[1829.96 → 1830.92] to depend on you,
[1831.34 → 1832.64] and we need to display you
[1832.64 → 1833.30] with our lives.
[1833.40 → 1834.30] In Jesus' name we pray.
[1834.78 → 1835.04] Amen.
