[0.00 → 8.44] Good morning, Hope.
[11.38 → 14.94] Well, this is the right atmosphere for today's message, for sure.
[15.84 → 18.14] And as we continue in our series of suffering,
[18.96 → 23.74] today we look specifically at the topic of rejection and loneliness.
[24.76 → 27.52] And so, as we...
[27.52 → 32.84] Yes, another sobering topic of the real suffering that we face in the world that we live in today.
[36.54 → 41.00] I want to start off by suggesting that our ontological being,
[41.22 → 44.48] meaning how are we created, what are we created for?
[45.40 → 50.16] I suggest that in our biblical faith, we are created as relational beings.
[50.70 → 54.78] That is the foundation and core of our identity made in the image of God.
[54.78 → 57.42] We are relational beings.
[58.34 → 62.06] Now, whether in our existence as relational beings,
[62.84 → 64.28] whether intended or not,
[65.10 → 66.92] and whether this is important,
[67.50 → 68.78] whether we are the rejected,
[69.40 → 71.94] or sometimes when we are the rejecters,
[72.74 → 74.86] whatever conflict we have in our relationships,
[75.34 → 76.88] in the world that we live in,
[77.44 → 81.08] we inevitably face an wholeness of some kind.
[81.08 → 86.30] We will face rejection and loneliness in this world.
[87.90 → 89.50] Can I get an amen for this part?
[90.12 → 90.38] No?
[92.74 → 95.30] Not the most positive thing to say amen to,
[95.54 → 98.72] but to think that in the world that we live in today,
[99.40 → 101.86] the world of social media,
[101.86 → 103.72] where we get to,
[103.82 → 105.24] we have the opportunity to,
[105.24 → 107.58] to make friends from all over the world.
[108.54 → 110.20] There's something beautiful to that.
[110.34 → 112.54] There's something kingdom reflected in that.
[112.54 → 119.62] But it is ironic that even if you have a thousand friends on Facebook,
[119.62 → 123.06] or thousands of followers on Instagram or TikTok,
[123.86 → 126.12] you can still be so lonely.
[126.12 → 130.00] You're surrounded by people constantly,
[130.64 → 134.20] but that does not solve the problem of loneliness.
[135.72 → 138.06] You might think that the CEO,
[138.26 → 140.26] the founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,
[140.60 → 141.90] and his metaverse,
[142.66 → 145.70] that they have the answer to solve all the loneliness,
[145.90 → 148.34] the problem of loneliness in the world that we live in.
[148.94 → 150.96] But I hope you can agree with me
[150.96 → 153.12] that in our faith, we confess,
[153.40 → 154.10] and we know,
[154.10 → 157.98] hopefully we will get to know for some of our younger generation,
[158.74 → 160.36] that the
[160.50 → 161.16] the
[161.42 → 163.22] what's that called?
[163.90 → 164.96] I'm lost here.
[165.42 → 168.00] The virtual reality.
[168.66 → 170.52] Virtual reality of
[170.52 → 173.54] trying to get across a message that you're never alone
[173.54 → 176.70] because you have a thousand friends on Facebook or Instagram.
[177.52 → 180.82] That cannot solve the relational void
[180.82 → 182.68] that only God can fill.
[182.68 → 184.56] That is our confession.
[185.14 → 187.16] Only God can fill that void.
[188.90 → 192.60] And loneliness can come from very many different places and situations in life.
[193.42 → 194.10] But today,
[194.46 → 196.80] specifically reflecting on the topic of rejection,
[197.82 → 198.94] when being rejected,
[199.12 → 202.18] there is a vivid loneliness that usually stems from it.
[202.18 → 206.46] And we don't have to look too far to see examples of this in our lives.
[207.10 → 207.36] Whether,
[207.36 → 210.62] whether it be a bad breakup in a significant relationship
[210.62 → 212.80] that you've known for a long time,
[212.90 → 215.86] whether it be a significant partner or a friendship,
[216.64 → 218.04] and that breakup happens.
[218.58 → 219.04] Or,
[219.18 → 221.24] when you're bullied by kids at school,
[221.66 → 224.28] rejected out of relationships because you're different.
[224.28 → 225.22] Or,
[225.22 → 227.42] you're not hired for a job,
[227.66 → 229.28] and you're rejected of a position.
[230.24 → 230.66] Or,
[230.94 → 233.32] being rejected of a status in Canada
[233.32 → 236.48] when you're trying to be an immigrant or a refugee,
[236.70 → 238.60] trying to make a home for yourself and your family.
[239.42 → 239.90] Or,
[240.06 → 241.02] you're not invited.
[241.68 → 242.66] Not invited.
[243.04 → 246.28] Rejected from family gatherings because you have differing opinions.
[246.28 → 248.30] Whatever the situation may be,
[248.70 → 249.68] we face rejection.
[251.10 → 252.46] It could also be,
[252.56 → 253.86] and turn this around on ourselves,
[254.16 → 256.98] it could also be the rejection that happens within ourselves.
[257.64 → 257.98] Meaning,
[258.88 → 260.26] you think to yourself,
[260.52 → 261.92] and you keep doubting yourself,
[262.50 → 262.92] saying,
[263.34 → 266.28] you're never good enough to be loved by God and by others.
[269.04 → 269.64] Or,
[270.12 → 271.96] taking our faith into consideration,
[272.34 → 273.96] as Jesus already warned us,
[273.96 → 276.94] it could be being rejected because of your faith.
[277.18 → 279.70] Where the social context and the cultural narrative
[279.70 → 283.58] stands against your faith and your values.
[284.90 → 285.82] Jesus said,
[285.90 → 286.60] and he warned us,
[286.84 → 288.88] the world will hate you because of me.
[290.00 → 291.70] The world will hate you,
[291.92 → 293.46] will reject you because of me.
[294.58 → 294.96] And so,
[295.06 → 295.82] in this sense,
[296.38 → 298.86] all of us can feel lonely at times.
[299.88 → 300.98] But the good news,
[301.08 → 301.58] the gospel,
[302.10 → 303.24] and I do want to emphasize,
[303.24 → 304.92] and highlight that the gospel,
[305.04 → 305.60] the good news,
[305.64 → 306.84] does not stop there.
[307.14 → 309.50] It does not stop at Jesus telling us,
[309.76 → 311.56] the world will hate you because of me.
[313.76 → 314.98] It doesn't stop there.
[315.04 → 315.44] He says,
[315.56 → 317.56] I will be with you to the end.
[319.08 → 319.84] Take heart,
[319.96 → 321.02] I have overcome the world.
[321.46 → 323.36] That's where the message ends.
[323.62 → 325.58] That's where the message has to land.
[325.58 → 327.46] That is the gospel truth.
[327.46 → 329.38] And so,
[329.86 → 334.44] with Jesus being able to empathize with all the sufferings that we go through,
[334.56 → 336.04] including loneliness,
[336.70 → 338.36] and through the rejection that we face,
[338.74 → 340.02] who better to turn to,
[340.92 → 346.36] to see an example of how we deal with loneliness in our Christian faith.
[346.36 → 347.62] And so,
[347.72 → 349.02] if you have your Bibles with you,
[349.06 → 350.44] you can go into the text now.
[350.96 → 353.80] Matthew 26 is the text that we are looking at this morning.
[354.94 → 356.60] If you have your phones or your Bibles,
[356.72 → 358.10] or if you would like to see on screen,
[358.24 → 359.88] we're looking at Matthew 26,
[360.08 → 362.46] and we start reading from verse 36.
[363.78 → 368.36] This is Jesus' prayer as he goes up to the Mount of Olives,
[368.46 → 369.78] the Garden of Gethsemane.
[369.78 → 375.82] Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane,
[375.92 → 376.82] the Mount of Olives,
[376.88 → 378.26] and he said to them,
[378.62 → 380.74] Sit here while I go over there and pray.
[381.62 → 383.06] He took three disciples,
[383.48 → 385.02] Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,
[385.14 → 385.86] along with him,
[386.02 → 389.18] and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
[390.48 → 391.46] Then he said to them,
[391.86 → 395.14] My soul is overwhelmed to the point of death.
[395.90 → 398.32] Stay here and keep watch with me.
[399.78 → 401.42] Going a little further,
[401.64 → 403.72] he fell with his face to the ground and prayed,
[404.12 → 405.98] My Father, if it is possible,
[406.36 → 408.40] may this cup be taken from me.
[408.82 → 409.66] It's too heavy.
[411.06 → 413.22] Yet, not as I will,
[413.84 → 415.24] but as you will.
[416.98 → 417.38] Amen.
[418.76 → 421.06] Now before we dive into this text,
[421.70 → 424.72] and before we reflect on Jesus' sorrow
[424.72 → 427.36] and his path to the cross for us,
[427.36 → 430.50] I want to read again our theme verse
[430.50 → 432.44] for our sermon series on suffering,
[432.74 → 434.28] which comes from John 16.
[434.84 → 438.14] This is from John 16, verses 32 to 33.
[438.80 → 440.00] Jesus says to us,
[440.22 → 441.28] A time is coming,
[441.54 → 443.00] and in fact it has come,
[443.22 → 444.46] when you will be scattered,
[444.86 → 446.08] each to your own home.
[446.94 → 449.28] You will leave me all alone.
[449.28 → 452.16] But I am not alone,
[452.54 → 453.76] for my Father is with me.
[454.18 → 455.94] Now I have told you all these things,
[456.14 → 458.10] so that you may have peace in me.
[459.46 → 460.36] And here is our verse,
[460.42 → 461.12] our theme verse.
[461.50 → 462.54] In this world,
[462.96 → 463.96] we will have trouble.
[464.76 → 465.84] You will have trouble.
[466.46 → 467.24] But take heart,
[467.60 → 468.74] I have overcome the world.
[470.40 → 472.52] Now these two verses from John
[472.52 → 474.76] capture the essence of my sermon this morning.
[474.76 → 479.06] It is both good news of the hope in Jesus Christ,
[479.56 → 483.90] who provided for us a path to eternal non-loneliness,
[484.04 → 485.12] if I may put it that way.
[486.18 → 487.72] Eternal non-loneliness.
[489.16 → 491.22] And this is the gospel part.
[491.94 → 492.52] But also,
[492.64 → 494.84] it also acknowledges
[494.84 → 497.66] that we will also have trouble in this world.
[498.22 → 499.44] It does not neglect
[499.44 → 501.96] the suffering that we will face.
[501.96 → 505.58] And this is reflected in Jesus' prayer in Matthew 26.
[506.74 → 508.24] And so the good news part
[508.24 → 510.40] is that Jesus has now provided for us
[510.40 → 512.42] a path to non-loneliness.
[513.40 → 516.08] And this is done through His obedience,
[516.40 → 518.80] all the way to death on the cross,
[519.02 → 520.28] and through His resurrection,
[520.74 → 522.38] we are given the good news,
[522.48 → 524.84] the gift of the eternal relationship
[524.84 → 526.06] that we get to enjoy
[526.06 → 528.26] with God and with one another.
[528.26 → 530.60] And this is done,
[530.94 → 532.32] and this is gifted to us,
[532.48 → 533.34] this relationship,
[534.12 → 535.74] that loving relationship with the Father
[535.74 → 536.82] and with one another.
[537.08 → 539.64] This is given to us through acceptance.
[540.64 → 542.58] And this is a direct opposite
[542.58 → 544.10] to what we're looking at today,
[544.40 → 545.16] in rejection.
[546.22 → 547.78] God accepted us
[547.78 → 549.88] when we rejected Him.
[550.36 → 552.12] That's the gospel irony right there.
[552.12 → 554.30] To say again,
[554.60 → 556.18] we who rejected God,
[556.52 → 557.68] we rebellious sinners
[557.68 → 558.98] who rejected God,
[559.50 → 561.26] God has accepted us
[561.26 → 562.78] into relationship with Him
[562.78 → 563.36] through the death
[563.36 → 564.70] and resurrection of Jesus.
[565.12 → 566.94] And the good news continues on.
[567.64 → 569.38] We are now called to reflect
[569.38 → 571.24] that accepting love of God
[571.24 → 571.90] to one another.
[572.16 → 573.44] It's the simple message,
[573.70 → 574.66] the focused message
[574.66 → 575.86] of the gospel once again.
[575.86 → 577.08] We are blessed
[577.08 → 578.68] to be a blessing.
[578.68 → 582.08] This is reflected in Ephesians 2.
[582.68 → 583.64] I would say that would be
[583.64 → 584.92] my favourite chapter in the Bible.
[585.32 → 586.40] Ephesians 2 captures
[586.40 → 587.62] the focus of the gospel
[587.62 → 589.80] where it says in verse 6 to 7,
[590.58 → 592.64] God raised us up with Christ
[592.64 → 594.30] and seated us with Him
[594.30 → 596.18] in the heavenly realms in grace.
[597.30 → 599.08] In order that in the coming ages
[599.08 → 600.26] He might show us,
[600.92 → 602.96] show the incomparable riches
[602.96 → 603.66] of His grace,
[604.18 → 606.24] express in His kindness to us
[606.24 → 607.32] in Christ Jesus.
[608.68 → 610.08] Through the kindness
[610.08 → 611.86] in Christ Jesus shown to us,
[612.06 → 612.96] we are blessed.
[613.58 → 614.36] And in verse 10,
[614.96 → 616.06] it reflects a blessing.
[617.20 → 618.16] We are for,
[618.30 → 619.52] we are God's handiwork,
[620.08 → 621.66] created in Christ Jesus
[621.66 → 623.66] to do good works,
[624.22 → 625.32] which God prepared
[625.32 → 626.56] in advance for us to do.
[628.96 → 629.98] And so in short,
[630.48 → 632.04] that gospel message is,
[632.62 → 634.66] we live in the hope
[634.66 → 635.64] of that redemption,
[636.04 → 636.70] that restoration
[636.70 → 637.84] of that relationship,
[637.84 → 639.12] that brokenness
[639.12 → 639.88] and the loneliness
[639.88 → 640.86] that come from it.
[641.06 → 642.28] We live in that hope
[642.28 → 643.08] of Jesus,
[643.48 → 644.66] enjoying what we call
[644.66 → 645.56] the foretaste
[645.56 → 646.74] of the kingdom to come
[646.74 → 648.54] here and now
[648.54 → 649.62] as we live
[649.62 → 651.84] and strive
[651.84 → 653.52] to be more Christ-like
[653.52 → 654.72] in our daily lives.
[655.24 → 656.56] That's the foretaste,
[657.12 → 658.32] the relationship,
[658.88 → 659.56] the restoration
[659.56 → 660.46] that is to come
[660.46 → 661.96] that we get to foretaste
[661.96 → 663.04] here and now.
[664.16 → 664.88] And this is done
[664.88 → 665.52] through Christ.
[665.52 → 665.60] Christ.
[665.92 → 666.92] That's the good news.
[668.30 → 669.96] But we have to realize
[669.96 → 671.08] and acknowledge the fact
[671.08 → 672.10] that the Bible,
[672.56 → 673.44] the biblical narrative
[673.44 → 674.14] and the gospel
[674.14 → 675.20] is not naive.
[676.30 → 677.32] It does not say,
[677.74 → 677.98] good,
[678.20 → 678.82] you're going to have
[678.82 → 679.40] the foretaste
[679.40 → 680.30] of the kingdom to come,
[680.62 → 681.96] everything will be peachy
[681.96 → 683.04] now that you're a Christian.
[683.26 → 684.04] Now that you come
[684.04 → 685.08] to church on Sundays,
[685.34 → 686.08] everything will be
[686.08 → 687.08] perfectly fine.
[687.26 → 688.42] No more suffering, right?
[690.00 → 690.90] That's not what
[690.90 → 691.70] the Bible says.
[691.70 → 693.70] This world,
[694.16 → 695.06] you will have trouble.
[696.30 → 697.66] We can live through that
[697.66 → 698.60] because we have hope,
[698.96 → 700.74] but we do have trouble.
[702.58 → 703.74] It is significant,
[704.02 → 704.48] I think,
[704.74 → 705.48] in this season,
[705.60 → 706.92] what we call Lent season,
[707.38 → 709.18] before we go to Easter.
[709.74 → 711.04] We don't want to rush
[711.04 → 712.12] all the way into Easter
[712.12 → 713.38] and just emphasize,
[713.62 → 713.88] yay,
[714.32 → 715.30] Jesus has risen
[715.30 → 717.18] and everything is happy.
[718.02 → 719.50] We have hope in that.
[719.50 → 721.64] We believe that to be true.
[721.92 → 722.68] There is power
[722.68 → 724.66] in the resurrection of Christ.
[725.10 → 726.14] We live in that hope,
[726.36 → 727.40] but here and now,
[727.52 → 729.24] we also live in suffering.
[730.38 → 732.16] As Jesus has already told us,
[732.58 → 733.64] the world will hate you
[733.64 → 734.26] because of me.
[734.56 → 735.26] In this world,
[735.38 → 736.24] you will have trouble.
[737.40 → 739.44] That is why we say
[739.44 → 740.26] we have hope,
[740.62 → 742.70] just as Paul said in Romans.
[744.18 → 745.92] For in this hope,
[746.12 → 746.78] we are saved,
[746.78 → 748.96] but hope that is seen
[748.96 → 750.22] is no hope at all.
[750.52 → 751.62] Who hopes for something
[751.62 → 752.70] that they already have?
[753.96 → 754.98] But for things
[754.98 → 756.34] that we don't have yet,
[756.90 → 758.74] we wait for it patiently.
[762.24 → 763.40] In this world,
[763.52 → 764.34] you will have trouble.
[765.20 → 766.48] And just like Jesus
[766.48 → 767.18] that we read
[767.18 → 768.46] in our Matthew text,
[768.98 → 770.44] we will all face
[770.44 → 771.90] rejection and loneliness.
[771.90 → 774.44] And so I think
[774.44 → 774.96] it is important
[774.96 → 775.50] at this point
[775.50 → 776.14] to realize
[776.14 → 778.22] where and what situation
[778.22 → 779.16] Jesus prays
[779.16 → 779.90] the final words
[779.90 → 781.40] of prayer in Gethsemane
[781.40 → 782.26] before he goes up
[782.26 → 782.84] to the cross.
[784.22 → 784.54] You see,
[784.64 → 785.34] Jesus was not
[785.34 → 786.34] preparing himself
[786.34 → 787.06] and praying
[787.06 → 788.44] after much encouragement
[788.44 → 789.16] from his family
[789.16 → 789.72] and friends.
[790.28 → 790.96] He wasn't going
[790.96 → 792.40] to the garden
[792.40 → 793.44] with a bunch
[793.44 → 794.18] of supporters saying,
[794.32 → 794.88] yay, Jesus,
[795.14 → 795.94] you got this,
[796.20 → 797.30] you got to go to the cross,
[797.38 → 798.12] we'll be right there
[798.12 → 798.64] for you.
[799.32 → 800.36] You have to do this
[800.36 → 801.18] for our sins.
[801.52 → 802.12] Don't worry,
[802.22 → 802.84] we'll support you
[802.84 → 803.28] all the way.
[804.18 → 805.02] That is not
[805.02 → 806.28] the situation at all.
[807.70 → 809.06] His closest friends,
[809.46 → 810.66] his closest disciples,
[811.42 → 812.40] three are mentioned today,
[812.50 → 813.50] Peter, James, and John.
[814.30 → 815.90] Even they don't stay awake
[815.90 → 817.00] enough to pray with him.
[818.06 → 819.10] He is abandoned
[819.10 → 820.26] by everyone.
[820.68 → 821.44] He is rejected
[821.44 → 822.18] by the world
[822.18 → 823.46] that he came to save.
[825.22 → 826.06] And to think,
[826.54 → 827.70] Jesus already knew that.
[828.64 → 830.00] And in Matthew 25,
[830.08 → 831.04] the chapter 1 before,
[831.66 → 832.74] he even predicts
[832.74 → 834.52] that Peter will betray him
[834.52 → 835.18] three times.
[836.14 → 836.76] He knows
[836.76 → 837.90] that he will be betrayed,
[838.28 → 838.68] abandoned,
[838.88 → 839.30] rejected,
[839.50 → 840.76] and left all alone
[840.76 → 841.64] by himself.
[842.38 → 843.50] Rejected by everyone.
[845.00 → 845.66] And even more
[845.66 → 846.76] significant than that,
[847.26 → 848.12] he knows
[848.12 → 849.34] that he will be
[849.34 → 850.78] and he will have to be
[850.78 → 853.06] rejected by his own father,
[853.44 → 854.38] by God himself.
[856.68 → 858.16] He is all alone.
[858.64 → 859.50] Remember Jesus'
[859.68 → 860.92] final words on the cross.
[862.14 → 862.82] My God,
[862.94 → 863.50] my God,
[864.04 → 865.98] why have you forsaken me?
[869.20 → 870.88] Jesus can relate to us.
[872.42 → 873.34] Picture yourself
[873.34 → 874.26] being lonely
[874.26 → 875.46] in your suffering,
[876.02 → 877.32] just like Jesus.
[877.32 → 880.38] Can you agree with me
[880.38 → 881.00] at this point
[881.00 → 882.42] when I dare prophesy
[882.42 → 884.40] that we will all face
[884.40 → 885.30] rejection
[885.30 → 886.02] and loneliness?
[887.18 → 887.50] Again,
[887.58 → 888.30] can I get an amen
[888.30 → 888.78] for that?
[889.28 → 889.58] Yes?
[889.58 → 889.66] Yes?
[895.66 → 896.86] I think everyone
[896.86 → 897.38] can agree.
[898.54 → 899.52] At the least,
[899.70 → 900.54] even if you haven't
[900.54 → 901.12] gone through
[901.12 → 903.24] really hard times
[903.24 → 904.28] when it comes
[904.28 → 904.80] to rejection,
[904.80 → 905.94] you can agree
[905.94 → 906.54] with me that
[906.54 → 907.60] in situations
[907.60 → 908.54] of being rejected,
[908.94 → 910.04] you get this feeling
[910.04 → 910.84] of emptiness
[910.84 → 912.44] or brokenness
[912.44 → 913.84] and the loneliness
[913.84 → 914.82] that we're talking about.
[915.78 → 916.16] Now,
[916.20 → 916.82] it may not be
[916.82 → 917.96] the most joyful exercise
[917.96 → 918.88] and I do understand
[918.88 → 919.50] that my sermon
[919.50 → 920.18] from the beginning
[920.18 → 921.78] has been very serious.
[922.54 → 923.84] I'm a very serious guy
[923.84 → 924.28] usually,
[924.66 → 925.66] and so not a lot
[925.66 → 926.04] of humour
[926.04 → 927.80] has been reflected
[927.80 → 929.78] in this sermon
[929.78 → 930.40] so far.
[930.40 → 933.00] but bad news,
[933.06 → 933.70] I have to bring you
[933.70 → 934.72] down a little bit further.
[935.52 → 936.68] I want you to try
[936.68 → 937.16] and picture
[937.16 → 937.76] and imagine
[937.76 → 938.38] or remember
[938.38 → 940.48] the last time
[940.48 → 941.52] that you went through
[941.52 → 942.62] some sort of rejection,
[943.48 → 945.00] that loneliness.
[946.34 → 946.92] I'll throw out
[946.92 → 947.62] some examples
[947.62 → 948.70] that I thought of.
[950.24 → 951.16] For students,
[951.76 → 952.58] when you're applying
[952.58 → 953.30] for universities
[953.30 → 954.42] and you have a university
[954.42 → 955.28] that you really want
[955.28 → 955.82] to go to
[955.82 → 957.04] and you get a letter
[957.04 → 957.50] in the mail
[957.50 → 958.20] or your email
[958.20 → 959.62] saying that you were
[959.62 → 960.22] not accepted
[960.22 → 961.10] into that university
[961.10 → 963.70] or that letter
[963.70 → 964.48] from the government
[964.48 → 965.66] telling you
[965.66 → 966.08] that you are
[966.08 → 967.24] no longer welcome
[967.24 → 968.18] to stay in the country
[968.18 → 968.60] that you want
[968.60 → 969.26] to call home
[969.26 → 973.70] or maybe feeling
[973.70 → 975.46] the feeling
[975.46 → 976.36] of being rejected
[976.36 → 977.08] by God
[977.08 → 978.00] when you get
[978.00 → 978.70] a diagnosis
[978.70 → 980.24] from your health provider
[980.24 → 981.20] saying that your health
[981.20 → 981.68] is not going
[981.68 → 982.32] to get any better
[982.32 → 985.40] and you get
[985.40 → 986.74] that panicked feeling
[986.74 → 988.28] of lonely hopelessness
[988.28 → 990.02] where you can't think
[990.02 → 990.92] of a single person
[990.92 → 991.66] that can help you
[991.66 → 992.36] in your suffering.
[994.42 → 996.44] That almost physical pain
[996.44 → 996.98] that you feel
[996.98 → 997.60] in your heart,
[998.34 → 999.62] that gut-wrenching feeling.
[1002.54 → 1003.98] I read a research article
[1003.98 → 1004.68] with the title
[1004.68 → 1007.10] Why Rejections Hurts So Much.
[1008.16 → 1010.24] A researcher from UCLA
[1010.24 → 1011.74] apparently discovered
[1011.74 → 1012.80] that social pain
[1012.80 → 1014.42] such as being rejected
[1014.42 → 1015.68] or let down by others
[1015.68 → 1017.74] and physical pain
[1017.74 → 1019.18] like an injury in sports.
[1020.04 → 1020.78] They're felt
[1020.78 → 1021.76] in the same parts
[1021.76 → 1022.30] of the brain.
[1023.62 → 1024.36] In other words,
[1024.76 → 1025.88] the brain can't tell
[1025.88 → 1026.40] the difference
[1026.40 → 1027.82] between a broken arm
[1027.82 → 1029.56] and a broken relationship.
[1030.50 → 1031.50] That's why it hurts
[1031.50 → 1032.02] so much
[1032.02 → 1033.86] according to the research.
[1035.12 → 1036.28] And so it's no wonder
[1036.28 → 1037.22] to think
[1037.22 → 1038.20] that when Jesus
[1038.20 → 1038.80] was praying
[1038.80 → 1039.68] in Gethsemane
[1039.68 → 1041.70] in the Gospel of Luke
[1041.70 → 1043.48] it actually includes
[1043.48 → 1043.98] a detail
[1043.98 → 1044.78] of how Jesus
[1044.78 → 1045.82] was sweating blood.
[1047.28 → 1047.74] Now you can get
[1047.74 → 1048.26] all scientific
[1048.26 → 1049.92] of why that happens
[1049.92 → 1051.02] but he was under
[1051.02 → 1051.80] a lot of stress
[1051.80 → 1052.82] to say the least.
[1055.14 → 1056.60] In our Matthew text
[1056.60 → 1057.12] he says,
[1057.78 → 1059.58] my soul is overwhelmed
[1059.58 → 1060.86] to the point of what?
[1061.72 → 1062.20] Death.
[1062.32 → 1063.24] I feel like I'm dying.
[1066.54 → 1068.14] Try to imagine again
[1068.14 → 1069.66] being in Jesus' shoes,
[1069.98 → 1070.78] being lonely
[1070.78 → 1071.54] like he was.
[1071.84 → 1072.98] Imagine that you are
[1072.98 → 1074.84] the only righteous person
[1074.84 → 1075.90] to have ever lived
[1075.90 → 1076.90] but now you have
[1076.90 → 1077.86] to take on the burden
[1077.86 → 1079.52] of the whole world's sin.
[1079.98 → 1081.02] On top of that,
[1081.30 → 1082.84] the whole world rejects you.
[1083.60 → 1085.22] The whole world hates you.
[1086.48 → 1088.06] No one understands you.
[1088.50 → 1089.82] No one supports you
[1089.82 → 1091.08] or encourages you.
[1091.64 → 1092.46] And as I mentioned,
[1092.80 → 1094.02] even your closest friends
[1094.02 → 1094.78] and your disciples,
[1096.12 → 1097.72] they can't even stay awake
[1097.72 → 1098.86] to pray with you
[1098.86 → 1100.58] in your last moments.
[1100.78 → 1106.04] And God himself
[1106.04 → 1106.98] rejecting you
[1106.98 → 1108.78] so that others
[1108.78 → 1109.78] may be accepted
[1109.78 → 1110.90] into his family.
[1112.10 → 1113.12] Rejecting you
[1113.12 → 1114.16] so that others
[1114.16 → 1115.68] may be accepted.
[1116.98 → 1118.48] Now what would be
[1118.48 → 1119.36] your response?
[1119.96 → 1120.78] How would you feel
[1120.78 → 1121.70] in that situation
[1121.70 → 1122.94] of being all alone?
[1122.94 → 1125.88] Do you feel anger?
[1127.14 → 1127.66] Resent?
[1128.32 → 1128.68] Sorrow?
[1129.82 → 1130.38] Anxiety?
[1133.38 → 1134.66] Jesus can relate.
[1135.54 → 1136.20] He went through
[1136.20 → 1136.98] the same thing.
[1138.40 → 1140.10] But the important part is
[1140.10 → 1141.80] what is his prayer response?
[1142.48 → 1143.50] How does he continue
[1143.50 → 1144.08] his prayer?
[1144.52 → 1144.84] Father,
[1145.06 → 1146.06] if it is possible,
[1146.22 → 1147.94] take this cup from me.
[1147.94 → 1149.26] it is too heavy.
[1150.78 → 1151.10] Yet,
[1151.70 → 1153.16] not my will,
[1153.52 → 1154.90] but yours be done.
[1156.36 → 1157.66] Not my will,
[1158.04 → 1159.94] but yours be done, Father.
[1159.94 → 1167.04] Jesus' response
[1167.04 → 1168.50] is a prayer of obedience.
[1169.42 → 1170.38] And so that's the question
[1170.38 → 1171.70] I want to ask for us
[1171.70 → 1172.14] this morning.
[1173.42 → 1175.20] Are you willing
[1175.20 → 1176.56] to trust and obey God?
[1177.98 → 1178.94] Are you willing
[1178.94 → 1180.04] to trust and obey
[1180.04 → 1180.86] his will
[1180.86 → 1182.34] even in the midst
[1182.34 → 1183.12] of your suffering?
[1183.12 → 1185.98] Even in the face
[1185.98 → 1186.82] of being rejected
[1186.82 → 1187.62] from your work,
[1187.94 → 1188.96] from your relationships
[1188.96 → 1190.04] with others
[1190.04 → 1190.96] and with yourself,
[1191.48 → 1192.32] doubting yourself,
[1192.48 → 1193.24] being depressed
[1193.24 → 1195.02] and being hard on yourself
[1195.02 → 1195.96] that you're not worthy
[1195.96 → 1196.62] of being loved,
[1197.68 → 1198.46] even in the face
[1198.46 → 1199.28] of all the rejections
[1199.28 → 1199.96] that we may face
[1199.96 → 1200.56] in our world,
[1201.44 → 1202.46] will you still
[1202.46 → 1203.84] trust and obey
[1203.84 → 1204.98] God's will
[1204.98 → 1205.62] for your life?
[1207.40 → 1207.84] Now,
[1207.90 → 1208.70] this challenge
[1208.70 → 1209.68] isn't meant
[1209.68 → 1211.24] for me to stand up here
[1211.24 → 1212.08] and act all holy
[1212.08 → 1212.48] and say,
[1212.64 → 1212.76] hey,
[1212.76 → 1214.08] I got my act figured out.
[1214.40 → 1215.22] I always trust
[1215.22 → 1215.90] in God's will.
[1216.30 → 1216.98] Why don't you?
[1218.02 → 1218.90] It's not for me
[1218.90 → 1220.08] to put a burden on you.
[1220.28 → 1220.90] This call
[1220.90 → 1222.14] is a call to hope.
[1223.42 → 1224.66] It is not easy.
[1225.96 → 1226.70] Jesus knows
[1226.70 → 1227.46] it's not easy.
[1228.16 → 1229.50] It will not be easy.
[1230.44 → 1231.64] But it is a call
[1231.64 → 1232.28] to hope
[1232.28 → 1233.82] because Jesus
[1233.82 → 1234.68] was rejected
[1234.68 → 1235.78] so that we
[1235.78 → 1236.64] don't have to be.
[1236.64 → 1245.00] if I see someone
[1245.00 → 1245.38] crying,
[1245.50 → 1246.94] then I can't handle it.
[1247.10 → 1247.12] So,
[1248.10 → 1249.98] I have to not
[1249.98 → 1250.44] look at you,
[1250.60 → 1250.68] maybe.
[1255.10 → 1255.46] So,
[1255.60 → 1256.20] are you able
[1256.20 → 1256.86] to live
[1256.86 → 1258.30] with that hope
[1258.30 → 1259.46] as you face,
[1259.60 → 1260.62] as you will face
[1260.62 → 1261.06] rejection
[1261.06 → 1261.62] and loneliness?
[1261.62 → 1265.42] And to reflect
[1265.42 → 1266.76] a little bit further,
[1267.76 → 1268.60] however long
[1268.60 → 1269.40] it takes you,
[1269.98 → 1270.80] can your prayer
[1270.80 → 1271.44] of lament,
[1272.10 → 1272.58] the prayer
[1272.58 → 1273.20] that comes out
[1273.20 → 1273.76] of suffering,
[1274.16 → 1275.10] can that prayer
[1275.10 → 1276.16] lead you toward
[1276.16 → 1277.34] a prayer of praise?
[1278.94 → 1279.96] And like the psalmist
[1279.96 → 1280.84] in Psalm 42,
[1281.40 → 1282.44] can you relate
[1282.44 → 1283.68] and confess with him
[1283.68 → 1285.72] as he prays,
[1285.72 → 1287.14] why my soul
[1287.14 → 1288.30] are you downcast?
[1288.92 → 1290.36] Why so troubled
[1290.36 → 1291.08] within me?
[1294.64 → 1295.90] And then he goes on,
[1296.36 → 1297.10] put your hope
[1297.10 → 1297.68] in God
[1297.68 → 1299.04] for I will yet
[1299.04 → 1300.00] praise him,
[1300.34 → 1301.12] my Saviour,
[1301.32 → 1301.98] my God.
[1304.20 → 1304.72] Now,
[1304.80 → 1305.40] that space
[1305.40 → 1306.42] between lament
[1306.42 → 1307.60] and praise
[1307.60 → 1308.46] can feel like
[1308.46 → 1309.08] an eternity,
[1309.58 → 1310.56] especially when
[1310.56 → 1311.10] you are going
[1311.10 → 1311.76] through loneliness.
[1313.82 → 1314.94] But I invite you,
[1314.94 → 1315.80] brothers and sisters,
[1316.46 → 1317.30] put your hope
[1317.30 → 1317.88] in Christ.
[1317.98 → 1319.32] That is the only answer.
[1320.90 → 1322.32] Because of this hope,
[1322.48 → 1323.38] we are never alone.
[1324.72 → 1325.98] Even if we may not
[1325.98 → 1327.28] feel it or see it,
[1327.88 → 1329.16] God is always there.
[1331.48 → 1332.76] He took on rejection
[1332.76 → 1333.76] by the whole world
[1333.76 → 1334.96] so that we may not
[1334.96 → 1336.32] have to be alone.
[1336.58 → 1337.60] And this is exactly
[1337.60 → 1338.74] what it says
[1338.74 → 1340.02] in Hebrews 4,
[1341.04 → 1341.62] where the author
[1341.62 → 1342.44] of Hebrews says,
[1342.98 → 1343.94] talking about Jesus,
[1343.94 → 1345.12] for we do not
[1345.12 → 1346.48] have a high priest
[1346.48 → 1347.70] who is unable
[1347.70 → 1349.02] to empathize
[1349.02 → 1349.74] with our weaknesses,
[1350.28 → 1351.46] but we have one
[1351.46 → 1352.46] who has been tempted
[1352.46 → 1353.62] in every way,
[1354.20 → 1355.24] just as we are.
[1356.26 → 1356.60] Yet,
[1356.86 → 1358.02] he was without sin.
[1361.94 → 1362.60] That's why
[1362.60 → 1364.24] he was worthy
[1364.24 → 1365.30] to take on
[1365.30 → 1365.76] the burden
[1365.76 → 1366.34] of our sin,
[1366.44 → 1367.04] to die
[1367.04 → 1368.38] for our sins
[1368.38 → 1369.64] so that we may not
[1369.64 → 1370.48] have to be rejected
[1370.48 → 1370.96] and alone.
[1370.96 → 1376.56] He also provides
[1376.56 → 1377.24] for us
[1377.24 → 1378.54] a community.
[1380.14 → 1380.84] This is talking
[1380.84 → 1381.68] real life now.
[1382.38 → 1384.04] Not just some God
[1384.04 → 1384.52] out there,
[1384.84 → 1385.66] but God is here.
[1386.00 → 1386.96] God is with us.
[1387.76 → 1388.80] And one practical way
[1388.80 → 1389.86] that he is with us
[1389.86 → 1391.26] is through
[1391.26 → 1392.26] the faith community,
[1393.02 → 1394.04] through his church,
[1394.22 → 1394.74] his body.
[1395.80 → 1396.88] It's a community,
[1397.02 → 1398.14] the church is a community
[1398.14 → 1399.24] that live
[1399.24 → 1400.78] with the same hope
[1400.78 → 1401.64] in that Saviour.
[1402.76 → 1403.24] We,
[1403.50 → 1404.50] as fellow believers
[1404.50 → 1405.22] in Christ,
[1405.58 → 1406.76] when we embody
[1406.76 → 1407.72] and reflect
[1407.72 → 1409.18] this accepting
[1409.18 → 1410.50] love,
[1411.14 → 1412.38] we embody
[1412.38 → 1413.28] God's presence
[1413.28 → 1413.98] for one another.
[1417.10 → 1418.36] We embody
[1418.36 → 1419.10] God's love
[1419.10 → 1419.82] for one another.
[1419.82 → 1420.82] God's love
[1420.82 → 1421.82] for one another.
[1423.98 → 1425.10] And the church
[1425.10 → 1426.02] does not stop
[1426.02 → 1426.64] in these walls.
[1426.76 → 1427.86] We always say here,
[1428.72 → 1429.68] the church building
[1429.68 → 1430.70] is not the church.
[1431.62 → 1433.06] We are the church.
[1433.78 → 1434.62] And so if you apply
[1434.62 → 1435.22] that directly
[1435.22 → 1435.90] to our lives,
[1436.14 → 1437.32] when we leave
[1437.32 → 1438.32] and as we live
[1438.32 → 1438.84] our lives
[1438.84 → 1439.90] as sent people
[1439.90 → 1441.02] in our ordinary
[1441.02 → 1442.02] daily lives,
[1442.22 → 1443.50] we also get
[1443.50 → 1444.26] to embody
[1444.26 → 1445.40] that accepting
[1445.40 → 1446.46] of God-based love,
[1446.66 → 1447.84] the love of the Father
[1447.84 → 1448.94] for us
[1448.94 → 1450.54] that's reflected
[1450.54 → 1451.48] for the world,
[1452.20 → 1453.00] that blessed
[1453.00 → 1454.16] to be a blessing again.
[1458.54 → 1459.72] Who else
[1459.72 → 1460.84] can be that light
[1460.84 → 1461.26] of hope
[1461.26 → 1461.88] for the world
[1461.88 → 1463.08] that is also
[1463.08 → 1464.84] going through rejection
[1464.84 → 1465.88] and loneliness,
[1466.08 → 1467.04] so much division,
[1467.52 → 1469.18] so many broken relationships
[1469.18 → 1469.82] that are happening
[1469.82 → 1471.36] all over the world?
[1471.94 → 1472.82] They don't have
[1472.82 → 1473.98] that hope in Christ.
[1474.84 → 1475.98] So who will reflect
[1475.98 → 1476.96] that light for them?
[1476.96 → 1478.56] Who will be that hope
[1478.56 → 1479.12] for them?
[1479.48 → 1480.56] Who will be the light
[1480.56 → 1481.52] and the hope
[1481.52 → 1483.16] for our family members,
[1483.28 → 1483.92] our siblings,
[1484.48 → 1485.56] our friends and family,
[1485.82 → 1486.46] and our neighbours,
[1486.72 → 1488.08] and our work coworkers
[1488.08 → 1490.34] who don't have
[1490.34 → 1491.14] that same hope,
[1491.34 → 1492.04] who don't live
[1492.04 → 1492.72] with that hope?
[1493.50 → 1494.90] Who will provide them
[1494.90 → 1497.06] that comfort,
[1497.56 → 1498.18] that love
[1498.18 → 1498.84] that comes from
[1498.84 → 1499.32] our Father?
[1499.32 → 1504.96] And so right now
[1504.96 → 1505.58] in your lives,
[1505.90 → 1507.28] when you think of
[1507.28 → 1507.96] being rejected
[1507.96 → 1509.58] and being so lonely
[1509.58 → 1510.80] and suffering
[1510.80 → 1511.58] through that,
[1512.52 → 1513.82] who comes to mind
[1513.82 → 1514.26] for you?
[1517.26 → 1518.36] If you're the one
[1518.36 → 1519.12] who's going through
[1519.12 → 1519.74] that loneliness,
[1520.40 → 1522.42] who do you go to
[1522.42 → 1523.06] for support
[1523.06 → 1523.80] and comfort?
[1524.86 → 1526.06] Who brings you
[1526.06 → 1526.70] to Christ?
[1527.32 → 1528.04] Who brings you
[1528.04 → 1528.56] that hope?
[1528.56 → 1531.66] Are we able
[1531.66 → 1532.12] to do that
[1532.12 → 1533.02] for one another here?
[1535.52 → 1536.64] That is our call.
[1537.58 → 1538.74] That is our mission.
[1539.92 → 1540.72] And this mission
[1540.72 → 1542.16] is founded on Christ.
[1543.92 → 1544.54] He says,
[1544.68 → 1545.18] in this world
[1545.18 → 1546.08] you will have trouble.
[1546.58 → 1547.28] The world
[1547.28 → 1548.28] is in trouble.
[1549.84 → 1550.98] But take heart.
[1551.46 → 1552.56] It is not up to us.
[1553.38 → 1553.94] Take heart.
[1554.38 → 1555.48] Jesus has overcome
[1555.48 → 1556.04] the world.
[1556.04 → 1558.02] He is our hope.
[1559.52 → 1560.80] Jesus is our hope.
[1562.00 → 1562.80] Let's pray.
[1562.80 → 1563.88] loving,
[1563.88 → 1563.90] loving,
[1563.90 → 1567.94] loving,
[1567.94 → 1569.66] accepting,
[1574.04 → 1574.26] Father.
[1575.60 → 1577.18] We thank you so much
[1577.18 → 1577.76] for your love.
[1579.82 → 1580.98] We thank you
[1580.98 → 1583.26] for not looking
[1583.26 → 1584.18] to our sins
[1584.18 → 1587.18] and us having rejected you,
[1587.62 → 1588.64] but in your love
[1588.64 → 1589.82] for sending your son
[1589.82 → 1590.86] so that we may be
[1590.86 → 1592.02] accepted into your love.
[1592.02 → 1594.26] who are we
[1594.26 → 1595.66] to be deserving
[1595.66 → 1596.40] of this love?
[1597.50 → 1599.14] When we have rejected you,
[1599.34 → 1600.72] we have rejected one another.
[1600.98 → 1601.70] We have broken
[1601.70 → 1602.58] our relationships
[1602.58 → 1603.44] and our lives.
[1607.24 → 1608.56] Thank you for your grace.
[1610.48 → 1611.98] Thank you for being there,
[1612.66 → 1613.88] always being with us
[1613.88 → 1614.80] when we are lonely,
[1615.48 → 1617.56] when we feel so alone.
[1617.56 → 1622.70] So, Father,
[1622.80 → 1623.28] I pray
[1623.28 → 1624.56] that you will continue
[1624.56 → 1626.24] to use your people
[1626.24 → 1627.26] to be that light
[1627.26 → 1628.18] and hope for the world
[1628.18 → 1629.34] and for one another.
[1630.02 → 1631.76] May we build each other up
[1631.76 → 1633.38] so that we may be a church,
[1633.92 → 1635.24] we may be your light,
[1636.24 → 1637.74] that we may be a blessing
[1637.74 → 1638.40] for the world.
[1640.00 → 1641.82] May we not take that hope
[1641.82 → 1642.34] for granted.
[1642.76 → 1643.80] May we live in that
[1643.80 → 1645.46] in our day-to-day lives.
[1645.46 → 1647.46] May we live in that
[1647.46 → 1648.00] bless us,
[1648.20 → 1649.14] bless our community.
[1651.10 → 1652.14] We thank you, Lord.
[1652.22 → 1653.20] In Jesus' name we pray.
[1654.50 → 1654.78] Amen.
[1654.78 → 1654.88] Amen.
[1655.58 → 1656.02] Amen.
[1656.70 → 1656.88] Amen.
[1656.88 → 1658.80] Amen.
[1658.80 → 1659.00] Amen.
[1659.00 → 1659.08] Amen.
[1659.08 → 1659.50] Amen.
[1659.50 → 1659.54] Amen.
[1659.54 → 1659.66] Amen.
[1659.66 → 1659.72] Amen.
[1659.72 → 1659.92] Amen.
[1659.92 → 1660.00] Amen.
[1660.00 → 1660.02] Amen.
[1660.02 → 1660.16] Amen.
[1660.16 → 1660.22] Amen.
[1660.22 → 1660.24] Amen.
[1660.24 → 1660.34] Amen.
