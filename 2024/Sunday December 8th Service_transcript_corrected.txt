[0.00 → 3.48] Good morning.
[5.48 → 12.40] It's good to be with you this morning and have the opportunity to open God's Word.
[13.72 → 21.02] We're in this Advent season, as you've gathered, and our topic is words of waiting.
[22.88 → 29.62] And I was just thinking a lot about the word peace, but we have these big words, hope, love, joy, peace.
[30.66 → 41.74] And when the words are big, they get used a lot, but then they feel like they're not as deeply understood as they should be.
[42.60 → 46.52] And I think that's the impetus of the service, is to say, this is a big word.
[47.00 → 50.18] This is a word that we need to grapple with.
[51.32 → 53.32] You know, it's just so easy to say, oh, peace, right?
[53.44 → 55.46] But what do we mean? What are we talking about?
[55.54 → 58.98] So we're going to wrestle with that a little bit this morning here.
[58.98 → 65.34] You know, because I think when most of us look around, you know, we don't see a lot of peace.
[66.34 → 68.72] You know, we look at mental health problems abound.
[69.38 → 74.30] So many people talk about being anxious and struggle with their mental health.
[74.30 → 79.46] Even Christmastime is, in many ways, for many people, considered the time of anxiety and stress.
[79.74 → 88.52] And there's so much conflict between nations, between people, families, husbands, wives, friends, dogs versus cats.
[88.60 → 89.58] I mean, it's everywhere, right?
[89.58 → 92.48] Issues abound.
[93.32 → 95.12] And opinions abound.
[96.04 → 100.76] In this world, there are so many ways where we won't feel peaceful.
[101.94 → 103.96] And the question would be, then, why not?
[105.26 → 109.32] You know, what people might argue, we progress so much as humankind.
[109.32 → 111.78] And yet, you know, wars continue.
[112.18 → 114.16] Yeah, we establish some peace treaties.
[114.40 → 118.34] We have a ceasefire, but the ceasefire ceases to be.
[118.56 → 120.28] And the war carries on again.
[121.32 → 123.44] You figure by now we would have figured this stuff out.
[123.70 → 124.70] So what's going on here?
[125.28 → 125.66] Peace.
[125.78 → 126.28] What is it?
[127.06 → 132.74] It is defined, and you've heard it already this morning, kind of like an absence of conflict.
[134.06 → 134.38] Okay.
[134.70 → 135.74] An absence of conflict.
[135.74 → 138.64] Scripture kind of talks about that, too.
[139.06 → 141.24] But then Scripture adds this to it.
[141.62 → 143.34] This is peace that we're talking about.
[143.38 → 149.28] Not just the absence of conflict, but something better comes in place of the conflict.
[150.32 → 153.60] Something rich and deep and wonderful and powerful.
[155.20 → 156.64] I'm going to give you a lot of scriptures.
[156.90 → 159.24] I, you know, went and did a Google thing on peace.
[159.34 → 164.98] And I spent, you know, most of my time just reading these verses and pondering how I understood peace.
[164.98 → 166.52] I want to do the same with you.
[166.86 → 168.54] So we're going to jump to a lot of verses here.
[168.66 → 169.64] So get ready.
[170.44 → 171.68] Romans 15, 13.
[172.22 → 177.08] It says, may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace.
[178.04 → 178.44] How?
[178.98 → 180.68] As you trust in him.
[181.36 → 184.36] So that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[184.58 → 186.46] But you see there's a peace thing here.
[186.66 → 187.84] What's it connected to?
[188.26 → 189.22] Trusting in God.
[189.72 → 192.62] When we trust in God, somehow that connects us to peace.
[192.62 → 194.74] So Paul kind of leads us toward that.
[195.34 → 199.24] Peace here then is much more than just the absence of conflict.
[199.48 → 200.82] It involves trusting God.
[201.56 → 205.24] In the Old Testament, there's a lot of talk about shalom and all throughout scripture.
[205.40 → 206.82] That's the Hebrew word for peace.
[207.08 → 209.32] But it's not, it doesn't do it justice.
[209.74 → 214.20] What we talk about when we say peace or shalom, we talk about completeness.
[214.36 → 215.88] We talk about wholeness.
[216.16 → 218.24] We talk about there being no gaps in it.
[218.24 → 221.82] You know, you picture, they had on the video a picture of a wall.
[222.18 → 223.94] And there are no gaps in that wall.
[224.24 → 226.96] Something complicated is put together.
[227.40 → 229.06] And then wholeness happens.
[230.66 → 232.30] There's integrity in it.
[232.98 → 234.50] Well-being happens.
[235.16 → 240.16] And when things aren't put back together well, things break down again and again and again.
[240.26 → 242.16] And we see that in our world all the time.
[242.16 → 246.86] And that's why we keep having wars again, and we keep having conflict again and so forth and so on.
[248.54 → 252.62] And deep down inside, we all feel the need for restoration.
[253.24 → 255.38] But permanent restoration.
[255.96 → 257.52] Forever restoration.
[259.12 → 265.50] For now, we move toward wholeness in a broken world.
[266.54 → 267.98] Yeah, we want the fighting to stop.
[268.06 → 269.20] We want people to work together.
[269.20 → 273.74] Yet the Bible is full of people not living out of shalom.
[273.88 → 275.60] And you see the consequences of it.
[276.18 → 279.54] Right from the start, already in the garden, sin lurks.
[279.68 → 284.02] Satan lurks to bring about brokenness and all of what was good.
[284.96 → 286.12] Including Adam and Eve.
[287.44 → 291.26] In fact, we have a picture right at the beginning where the world was chaos.
[291.94 → 294.70] And then out of the chaos, God creates.
[296.22 → 298.16] Jumping way ahead to Isaiah.
[298.16 → 299.80] Isaiah looks forward then.
[299.80 → 302.16] And he kind of reflects the heart of the people in a way.
[302.66 → 304.50] Looks forward to a leader who comes.
[304.98 → 306.80] And he'll be a prince of shalom.
[307.64 → 311.24] And his reign would bring endless shalom.
[311.56 → 312.78] The deep desire that we have.
[313.02 → 314.10] And so they waited.
[314.28 → 314.92] We wait.
[315.80 → 317.70] And Jesus came, the prince of peace.
[318.86 → 322.56] In scripture, we read Jesus, when he neared the time of the cross.
[322.86 → 324.86] He said this in John 14, 27.
[324.86 → 327.06] Peace, I leave you.
[327.42 → 329.14] But keep in mind what kind of peace.
[329.26 → 330.10] Shalom, I leave you.
[330.42 → 331.82] My peace I give you.
[332.14 → 333.64] I don't give as the world gives.
[333.68 → 335.10] We're not doing that definition.
[335.92 → 337.66] Do not let your hearts be troubled.
[338.08 → 338.82] Do not be afraid.
[338.92 → 340.76] Because I've come to bring that kind of peace.
[341.90 → 344.76] Through Jesus' life and his death and his resurrection.
[344.76 → 349.14] Brokenness is replaced by wholeness.
[353.94 → 355.78] Ephesians 2, Paul says it this way.
[356.56 → 358.30] And it's very powerful the way this starts.
[358.64 → 361.70] For he, Jesus himself, is our peace.
[362.70 → 364.56] He is our peace.
[365.06 → 369.24] Who has made, and then Paul refers to some conflicts that exist in his time.
[369.48 → 370.78] As they have in all times.
[371.10 → 372.80] Who has made the two groups one.
[372.80 → 375.28] Who has destroyed the barrier.
[375.42 → 376.84] The dividing wall of hostility.
[377.00 → 378.20] Whatever that is.
[378.84 → 380.58] The dividing wall of hostility in your life.
[380.70 → 382.16] In the world itself.
[382.60 → 385.02] By setting aside in his flesh.
[385.86 → 388.26] The law with its commands and regulations.
[388.74 → 389.54] His purpose.
[389.70 → 390.20] His mission.
[390.54 → 392.52] Was to create in himself.
[392.64 → 393.76] You see this is all in Jesus.
[394.06 → 394.60] In himself.
[395.00 → 397.34] One new humanity out of the two.
[397.68 → 398.54] Whether there were two.
[398.70 → 399.76] There will be one.
[399.76 → 400.20] One.
[400.20 → 400.46] Forever.
[401.80 → 403.36] Thus making peace.
[404.96 → 407.12] And it's not just the absence of war.
[407.46 → 409.10] And it's not just the absence of conflict.
[410.12 → 412.84] And Jesus is peace.
[414.54 → 417.14] And his followers are called to help bring that peace.
[417.92 → 419.28] That shalom to the world.
[419.28 → 420.66] And yes.
[420.76 → 422.98] We live in the now and not yet.
[424.00 → 424.20] Right?
[424.56 → 425.96] Jesus' kingdom has come.
[426.20 → 427.32] And is coming.
[427.64 → 430.36] Somehow we live in this transitional kind of moment here.
[431.44 → 434.56] And we work toward that peace.
[435.68 → 438.26] I kind of always like it in 1 Corinthians 13.
[438.34 → 439.30] Paul is talking about love.
[439.64 → 440.58] But at one moment he said.
[440.66 → 440.78] You know.
[440.84 → 442.24] We see through a mirror dimly.
[442.50 → 444.28] Sort of translucent like glass.
[444.28 → 446.28] We don't see it clearly.
[446.54 → 447.78] Even if we think we do.
[450.78 → 453.32] And we move through the complexities of it all.
[453.70 → 457.28] To try and bring the homeless as God intended it to be.
[458.64 → 459.50] Let me ask you.
[459.54 → 462.48] Have you noticed complexities in your life?
[464.10 → 464.70] A few?
[466.54 → 467.28] Issues are complicated.
[468.06 → 468.92] They really are.
[469.08 → 470.66] People are complex.
[470.66 → 473.56] And sin makes it even more complicated.
[474.30 → 475.80] None of it is simple.
[476.08 → 477.40] Whatever we're talking about here.
[477.88 → 479.16] And you can say things like.
[479.38 → 482.30] Well if only they would have just listened to me.
[483.32 → 484.46] Because I know.
[486.12 → 486.36] Right?
[486.50 → 486.72] I don't know.
[487.08 → 487.56] Sometimes.
[489.22 → 491.74] If only both sides would just simply lay down their weapons.
[491.86 → 491.98] Yeah.
[492.08 → 493.58] But they pick them up again.
[494.90 → 495.70] If only.
[495.82 → 496.72] And we have all the if only.
[496.84 → 497.80] Then we'd have peace.
[497.88 → 498.06] Right?
[498.06 → 500.08] We see this in the world.
[500.18 → 501.30] Trying to figure it out too.
[502.38 → 503.26] Biblical peace.
[503.52 → 506.50] Reaches way beyond how our culture defines it.
[506.74 → 508.60] Or how we often define it too I think.
[508.80 → 509.68] And how we live it out.
[510.00 → 510.22] You know.
[510.34 → 512.48] Let's all just get along.
[513.40 → 514.98] But we never ask the hard question.
[515.28 → 516.80] Why don't we get along?
[519.30 → 520.98] Why am I always picking a fight here?
[522.48 → 524.66] Why am I always getting into arguments?
[524.66 → 524.90] Gee.
[524.98 → 525.92] Maybe there's something with you.
[525.92 → 528.02] Or with the world.
[528.16 → 528.56] And issues.
[528.68 → 529.28] And complexities.
[529.68 → 529.88] It's.
[530.18 → 530.50] You know.
[530.58 → 531.82] Why is it happening?
[533.38 → 533.58] And.
[534.10 → 534.24] You know.
[534.58 → 535.58] Another big word.
[535.76 → 536.14] You know.
[536.18 → 537.10] We have sin.
[538.80 → 539.24] Brokenness.
[539.54 → 540.92] We sang about that.
[541.00 → 541.12] Right?
[541.72 → 542.74] Brokenness happens.
[545.60 → 547.00] What do I do with that?
[548.68 → 551.32] How is that keeping me from peace inside myself.
[551.44 → 553.48] And in my relationship with others as well.
[553.48 → 554.74] And.
[554.74 → 555.46] And somehow.
[556.02 → 556.40] And.
[556.40 → 556.42] And.
[556.42 → 558.08] When we read in Philippians 4.
[558.68 → 559.58] Where Paul says.
[560.12 → 561.60] Don't be anxious about anything.
[561.74 → 562.86] But in every situation.
[563.06 → 563.84] Every situation.
[564.30 → 565.76] By prayer and petition.
[566.14 → 567.08] With Thanksgiving.
[567.20 → 568.22] Present your request to God.
[568.28 → 568.42] Okay.
[568.46 → 569.42] So stuff's happening.
[569.68 → 570.34] Pour it out to God.
[570.54 → 571.38] And what happens.
[571.64 → 573.04] And the peace of God.
[574.04 → 575.84] Which transcends all understanding.
[575.92 → 577.30] So bigger than your brain.
[577.68 → 579.76] Will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[580.16 → 580.60] Peace.
[580.60 → 582.90] That is beyond human comprehension.
[583.34 → 584.42] Bigger than you are.
[584.68 → 585.62] Somehow happens.
[585.78 → 587.84] When we surrender ourselves to Christ.
[592.44 → 593.00] Somehow.
[593.62 → 595.10] If I really want peace.
[595.14 → 596.04] And I understand it.
[596.04 → 596.96] And I know it's.
[597.38 → 599.08] That Jesus is peace.
[599.24 → 600.70] I have to humble myself.
[601.04 → 601.60] And realize.
[601.76 → 603.98] I'm messing up that definition quite regularly.
[604.28 → 605.90] I'm just looking for a peace.
[605.98 → 608.06] That makes my life easier.
[608.06 → 612.88] If only my wife would just listen to me.
[614.30 → 614.78] Right.
[614.90 → 615.04] You know.
[615.04 → 616.28] I just want simplicity.
[616.76 → 618.08] I want things my way.
[618.34 → 619.82] I'm in the way of peace somehow.
[621.58 → 622.76] And it starts.
[623.10 → 624.42] With surrender.
[624.88 → 626.10] To the prince of peace.
[626.32 → 627.34] Whose birth we celebrate.
[630.84 → 631.28] So.
[631.98 → 633.26] Let's look at Isaiah 9.
[633.36 → 634.04] Where we get this.
[634.50 → 634.94] Phrase.
[635.52 → 636.40] Prince of peace.
[636.40 → 638.72] Notice how it starts.
[639.86 → 641.56] The people walking in great dark.
[641.70 → 642.26] In darkness.
[642.44 → 643.44] Have seen a great light.
[643.94 → 644.16] All right.
[644.22 → 644.78] So here we go.
[645.32 → 646.48] They're walking in darkness.
[646.62 → 647.18] And brokenness.
[647.24 → 647.54] And sin.
[648.38 → 650.36] And on those living in the land of deep darkness.
[650.52 → 651.70] A light has dawned.
[652.40 → 654.68] You have enlarged the nations of God.
[654.90 → 656.02] And increased their joy.
[656.32 → 657.52] They rejoice before you.
[657.54 → 658.86] As people rejoice at a harvest.
[658.98 → 661.22] As warriors rejoice when dividing the plunder.
[661.22 → 664.02] For as in the days of Median's defeat.
[664.14 → 664.92] Battles they fought.
[665.32 → 667.50] You have shattered the yoke that burdens them.
[667.70 → 668.84] The bar across the shoulder.
[669.26 → 670.22] The rod of oppression.
[670.44 → 671.04] There's righteousness.
[671.68 → 673.70] Every warrior's boot used in battle.
[673.78 → 675.16] And every garment rolled in blood.
[675.40 → 676.60] Will be destined for burning.
[676.72 → 678.86] Because we're going to burn all the stuff used in war.
[679.22 → 680.78] Will be the fuel for the fire.
[681.04 → 681.42] Why?
[681.78 → 682.10] Why?
[682.92 → 683.64] Here we go.
[683.64 → 686.98] For to us a child is born.
[688.24 → 690.26] To us a son is given.
[690.78 → 692.52] And the government will be on his shoulders.
[692.70 → 694.40] And he will be called wonderful counsellor.
[694.54 → 695.12] Mighty God.
[695.44 → 696.34] Everlasting Father.
[696.74 → 697.88] Prince of peace.
[698.42 → 699.82] And of the greatness of his government.
[699.98 → 700.48] And of peace.
[700.78 → 701.60] There will be no end.
[702.90 → 704.28] He will reign on David's throne.
[704.40 → 705.14] And over his kingdom.
[705.24 → 706.26] That whole biblical story.
[706.72 → 706.86] Right?
[707.22 → 708.56] Establishing and upholding it.
[708.72 → 709.22] With what?
[709.30 → 710.68] With justice and righteousness.
[710.68 → 712.48] From that time and forever.
[712.48 → 713.74] And how's it going to happen?
[714.06 → 717.06] The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.
[718.54 → 720.28] God has to do it.
[721.06 → 722.86] And we surrender to his will.
[723.60 → 726.78] In this quest for shalom.
[729.12 → 730.58] In the middle of darkness.
[731.18 → 733.02] That promise was made.
[733.32 → 735.28] With war and injustice happening.
[735.76 → 736.90] And that promise comes.
[737.18 → 738.40] Peace will come.
[738.40 → 740.00] And you and I.
[740.00 → 743.06] We sit in the middle of our own brokenness.
[743.18 → 743.86] Our own pain.
[743.98 → 744.56] Our own hurts.
[744.94 → 747.26] And we see, and we feel the injustices.
[747.58 → 749.32] And we feel the weight of it all.
[749.64 → 751.34] And we see it in our relationships.
[752.30 → 754.86] And then this promise of deliverance comes.
[755.24 → 759.30] A promise to those who are looking for the way.
[759.82 → 761.22] And are looking for wholeness.
[761.36 → 762.26] And it's found in Jesus.
[762.52 → 763.80] Because he's the prince of peace.
[763.80 → 767.14] And he walks with us.
[767.52 → 769.74] When things aren't as they should be.
[770.68 → 771.96] In this time of promise.
[772.14 → 773.72] When Isaiah wrote this passage.
[775.02 → 776.68] Israel was headed into exile.
[777.42 → 778.74] They were a conquered nation.
[779.14 → 780.90] They'd lost it all humanly speaking.
[781.92 → 783.60] There would seem to be no peace for them.
[784.96 → 785.94] And like Israel.
[786.14 → 787.66] We look for someone to come.
[787.72 → 789.40] And make things whole and right again.
[789.66 → 790.72] But this time forever.
[790.72 → 793.64] And that's what we're going to celebrate at Christmas again.
[794.66 → 796.76] Someone who actually has the power.
[797.16 → 797.84] And the knowledge.
[798.14 → 798.74] And the grace.
[799.04 → 799.68] And the love.
[799.94 → 800.98] That wonderful counsellor.
[801.10 → 801.74] That mighty God.
[801.80 → 802.58] That everlasting father.
[802.92 → 806.16] And this promise says that someone will come.
[806.72 → 810.04] And I loved how Jonathan's team sang in the beginning there.
[810.14 → 811.08] We were saying how long.
[811.14 → 811.60] How long.
[811.88 → 812.22] Come.
[812.34 → 812.90] Come Lord Jesus.
[812.98 → 813.34] Come Lord Jesus.
[813.38 → 813.80] And then all of a sudden.
[813.86 → 814.46] Joy to the world.
[814.54 → 815.90] The Lord has come.
[815.90 → 816.04] Come.
[816.04 → 816.10] Come.
[819.20 → 820.80] They didn't just show up.
[821.18 → 822.48] He came into it all.
[824.14 → 824.98] And they waited.
[825.10 → 825.68] And we wait.
[826.96 → 828.94] And this is a promise they cling to.
[829.12 → 830.12] And we cling to it.
[830.28 → 832.34] Even when we feel like we're in exile too.
[832.66 → 833.76] And this Messiah comes.
[833.92 → 835.50] And he lives with us.
[835.54 → 836.28] To be with us.
[837.26 → 839.88] I love how in the version of the message.
[840.02 → 840.68] We have it on here.
[841.06 → 842.16] John 1.14.
[842.50 → 843.10] The word.
[843.20 → 843.78] That's Jesus.
[843.78 → 846.00] The word became flesh and blood.
[846.10 → 846.96] God became one of us.
[847.28 → 847.72] And what?
[848.14 → 849.42] Moved into the neighbourhood.
[849.56 → 850.06] I love that.
[851.34 → 853.54] We saw the glory with our own eyes.
[853.62 → 854.44] The one of kind glory.
[854.60 → 855.32] Like father.
[855.58 → 856.48] Like son.
[857.48 → 858.94] The prince of peace.
[859.74 → 861.90] Moved into your neighbourhood.
[864.50 → 865.94] Right where you are.
[868.06 → 872.08] And he would do what he said he would do.
[872.08 → 873.32] And what throughout history.
[873.52 → 875.26] We as humans couldn't do.
[875.60 → 878.08] We couldn't make peace happen.
[882.68 → 884.82] Here's an example of Jesus coming.
[885.18 → 885.94] Into the neighbourhood.
[886.50 → 888.38] This time the neighbourhood of a bunch of shepherds.
[888.90 → 891.14] Let's read Luke 2 a little bit of the Christmas story.
[892.54 → 892.90] There were.
[893.12 → 894.14] And these shepherds.
[894.30 → 894.44] Right.
[894.54 → 897.52] They're low down on the totem pole.
[897.52 → 900.04] They're an oppressed people.
[900.14 → 901.68] The Romans have taken over.
[902.12 → 903.74] They're not even well-loved among their own people.
[904.48 → 905.00] And here we go.
[905.26 → 907.20] There were shepherds camping in the neighbourhood.
[908.34 → 910.20] They had set night watches over the sheep.
[910.66 → 912.22] Suddenly God's angel stood among them.
[912.34 → 914.42] The glory of God's glory blazed around them.
[914.88 → 915.60] They were terrified.
[915.88 → 917.10] And the angel said don't be afraid.
[917.66 → 919.88] I'm here to announce a great and joyful event.
[920.08 → 922.30] That is meant for everybody worldwide.
[922.30 → 925.58] A saviour has just been born in David's town.
[925.90 → 928.04] A saviour who is the Messiah and master.
[928.76 → 930.52] This is what you're to look for.
[930.82 → 933.56] A baby wrapped in a blanket lying in a manger.
[934.56 → 937.02] And at once the angel was joined by a huge angelic choir.
[937.14 → 938.22] Singing God's praises.
[938.72 → 940.46] Glory to God in the heavenly heights.
[940.80 → 941.28] And here we go.
[941.80 → 943.52] Peace to all men and women on earth.
[943.64 → 944.68] Who please him.
[945.36 → 946.60] On whom his favour rests.
[947.44 → 949.34] As the angel choir withdrew into heaven.
[949.46 → 950.50] The shepherds talked it over.
[950.62 → 951.58] Let's go to Bethlehem.
[951.58 → 952.72] As fast as we can.
[952.78 → 953.66] And let's see for ourselves.
[954.12 → 955.58] What God has revealed to us.
[956.60 → 958.76] And there's these poor shepherds.
[959.86 → 961.24] Hearing this angel choir.
[961.34 → 961.98] They're blown away.
[962.44 → 963.42] And that peace on earth.
[963.60 → 965.24] On whom his favour rests.
[966.36 → 967.38] And they must have thought.
[967.98 → 968.38] Us?
[968.88 → 969.18] Me?
[971.32 → 973.10] His favour rests on me?
[974.22 → 975.62] I'm nobody's favourite.
[978.24 → 980.46] The promise is then fulfilled through this baby.
[980.46 → 981.46] And with his coming.
[981.46 → 983.46] We have peace with God.
[983.46 → 985.24] And with one another through Jesus.
[985.48 → 987.02] And all the broken pieces.
[987.48 → 988.88] Are made whole.
[989.20 → 990.72] Through the coming of this child.
[991.04 → 992.40] He brings a pathway.
[992.78 → 993.46] Toward restoration.
[994.82 → 995.70] And eternal hope.
[995.70 → 1000.20] I read this great quote here.
[1000.60 → 1002.68] Peace is more than absence of something.
[1003.04 → 1004.66] It is the presence of someone.
[1006.88 → 1007.78] Think about that.
[1007.88 → 1009.98] Peace is more than the absence of something.
[1010.10 → 1011.34] Which is where we tend to limit it.
[1011.72 → 1012.98] It is the presence of someone.
[1013.30 → 1015.00] Who comes to where you are.
[1015.10 → 1016.46] With all that's going on.
[1016.60 → 1017.32] All the pain.
[1017.40 → 1018.00] All the struggles.
[1018.36 → 1018.60] And said.
[1018.68 → 1019.44] I am the way.
[1019.52 → 1020.06] I am the truth.
[1020.12 → 1020.54] I am the life.
[1020.54 → 1022.12] No one comes to the Father except for me.
[1022.38 → 1024.46] And my favour rests on you.
[1026.62 → 1027.92] And then like the shepherds.
[1028.02 → 1028.48] We might say.
[1028.90 → 1030.04] That includes me.
[1031.12 → 1031.94] My life.
[1033.22 → 1034.36] His favour rests on me.
[1037.14 → 1037.54] How?
[1039.44 → 1040.34] John 14.
[1040.64 → 1041.40] Jesus said this.
[1042.22 → 1043.54] All this I have spoken to you.
[1044.66 → 1045.86] While still with you.
[1045.94 → 1046.52] But the advocate.
[1046.64 → 1047.22] The Holy Spirit.
[1047.28 → 1048.64] Whom the Father will send in my name.
[1048.70 → 1049.78] Will teach you all things.
[1049.78 → 1050.86] I am going to remind you.
[1050.86 → 1051.84] Of everything I have said to you.
[1052.56 → 1054.00] Peace I leave with you.
[1054.10 → 1055.20] My peace I give.
[1055.50 → 1056.92] I do not give as the world gives.
[1057.44 → 1058.08] Do not fear.
[1058.90 → 1060.06] Or do not let your hearts be troubled.
[1060.16 → 1060.96] Do not be afraid.
[1061.72 → 1063.30] Jesus says to his followers.
[1063.94 → 1065.62] I am leaving my peace with you.
[1066.00 → 1067.64] With the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1068.72 → 1069.84] You are not on your own.
[1071.42 → 1073.16] My forever peace I leave with you.
[1073.70 → 1075.42] And this is the peace that stays with us.
[1075.62 → 1077.80] This is the catalyst against the fear.
[1077.80 → 1079.04] And against the darkness.
[1079.04 → 1081.08] Peace bigger than troubles and fear.
[1081.40 → 1082.66] Bigger than sin and death.
[1083.90 → 1085.86] And it's interesting to me that Jesus uses a command.
[1086.12 → 1088.02] He commands his disciples on us.
[1088.46 → 1090.18] Do not be afraid.
[1092.84 → 1094.44] It doesn't sound optional.
[1095.92 → 1096.56] And we might say.
[1096.64 → 1096.84] Well yeah.
[1096.94 → 1099.86] But have you seen what's going on in the world?
[1100.98 → 1101.88] Don't be afraid.
[1102.72 → 1102.92] Yeah.
[1102.96 → 1104.80] But have you seen the mess I am?
[1105.52 → 1106.44] Don't be afraid.
[1106.44 → 1110.60] Have you seen all the negative powers that work around me and in the world?
[1110.80 → 1111.52] Don't be afraid.
[1112.60 → 1115.86] My peace I leave with you through the spirit in you.
[1117.28 → 1118.64] And he says it again in John 16.
[1118.76 → 1122.14] I have told you these things so that in me, you may have peace.
[1122.22 → 1123.56] In me you may have peace.
[1123.76 → 1125.50] In this world you will have trouble.
[1125.72 → 1125.90] Right?
[1126.14 → 1127.06] We are not there yet.
[1127.26 → 1127.80] But take heart.
[1127.86 → 1128.82] I have overcome the world.
[1128.82 → 1133.56] And we see this throughout scripture.
[1134.18 → 1135.38] A God who is on the move.
[1136.02 → 1138.46] Moving through the chaos as I said in John.
[1138.72 → 1139.48] Toward wholeness.
[1139.60 → 1140.26] Toward shalom.
[1142.12 → 1143.84] He's doing that in your life.
[1145.08 → 1146.18] Trust that.
[1147.46 → 1150.74] That same God who was born a man comes to us.
[1150.84 → 1151.26] To you.
[1151.26 → 1153.10] He comes to you in your chaos.
[1153.16 → 1153.78] And he creates.
[1154.06 → 1154.76] He brings peace.
[1155.08 → 1155.72] He restores.
[1156.06 → 1156.64] He delivers.
[1156.64 → 1156.84] He delivers.
[1159.16 → 1162.80] And the conflicts don't necessarily just simply go away.
[1163.42 → 1164.64] But they are overcome.
[1165.28 → 1167.34] They are places of transformation.
[1168.00 → 1169.78] And they're replaced with forever shalom.
[1171.46 → 1171.92] So yes.
[1172.52 → 1173.30] You're going through a lot.
[1173.98 → 1175.72] In this world there will be trouble.
[1176.82 → 1180.10] This might be the first Christmas without a loved one.
[1182.44 → 1182.64] You know.
[1182.64 → 1184.66] I was talking to somebody this morning.
[1184.66 → 1188.40] About mom who passed away at 94.
[1188.70 → 1191.24] But the Banner Swags and the Ben Radons.
[1191.36 → 1192.66] Mom just passed away as well.
[1192.86 → 1193.26] My mom.
[1193.68 → 1195.08] This is the first Christmas without her.
[1195.48 → 1196.80] In our lives too.
[1198.10 → 1198.32] Yeah.
[1198.34 → 1199.66] There will be trouble.
[1199.82 → 1203.24] But death is still taking its toll in that sense.
[1203.82 → 1207.20] And yet we have the great confidence of eternal life.
[1207.20 → 1209.28] And then there's people who say.
[1209.40 → 1209.50] Well yeah.
[1209.52 → 1210.76] But I feel alone.
[1210.82 → 1211.38] Or I am alone.
[1211.58 → 1213.30] Or they may be fighting illness.
[1213.94 → 1215.42] Or they're unemployed.
[1215.58 → 1216.64] And struggling financially.
[1216.78 → 1218.44] Or dealing with relational messes.
[1218.58 → 1219.92] Or mental health struggles.
[1220.32 → 1223.42] Peace can feel a long ways away.
[1226.62 → 1227.70] And so we wait.
[1228.46 → 1229.64] That's what Adam's about.
[1230.40 → 1231.82] But we wait with words.
[1231.88 → 1232.34] What words?
[1233.14 → 1233.48] Love.
[1233.74 → 1233.98] Hope.
[1234.20 → 1234.44] Joy.
[1234.62 → 1234.94] Peace.
[1234.94 → 1235.06] Peace.
[1236.26 → 1236.74] Jesus.
[1237.20 → 1238.60] Jesus comes right where you are.
[1239.32 → 1240.34] Peace is found in him.
[1241.24 → 1242.18] He is our peace.
[1243.02 → 1246.52] And we then can be peacemakers with him.
[1247.16 → 1247.92] And through him.
[1248.62 → 1251.62] Confronting our fears while we hold on to the promise of Jesus with us.
[1252.10 → 1254.94] The one who brings wholeness even in the chaos.
[1256.30 → 1257.34] And I guess I'm going to ask you.
[1257.60 → 1259.26] Or encourage you to start with this.
[1259.52 → 1260.48] Start with prayer.
[1260.48 → 1262.02] You might say.
[1262.08 → 1263.18] How can I be a peacemaker?
[1264.14 → 1264.96] Start with prayer.
[1266.06 → 1269.80] Pray for the places of conflict that you notice in your world.
[1270.60 → 1272.64] Pray for those who have hurt you.
[1273.92 → 1275.16] Pray against fear.
[1275.34 → 1276.58] Pray against despair.
[1277.12 → 1279.54] Read all the passages of peace you can find.
[1280.00 → 1282.30] It was such a good week for me that way.
[1282.80 → 1285.76] And pray for the spirit to empower you to be a peacemaker.
[1285.76 → 1287.54] Even when it's hard.
[1290.42 → 1292.72] And focus your eyes on Jesus.
[1293.34 → 1294.90] The one who has come for you.
[1295.52 → 1296.56] To bring you hope.
[1297.24 → 1297.68] And peace.
[1298.22 → 1298.64] And joy.
[1299.28 → 1299.76] And love.
[1301.06 → 1302.28] For he is our peace today.
[1303.24 → 1304.50] And he is our peace forever.
[1304.50 → 1306.70] Let's pray.
[1309.78 → 1311.24] Father God we come before you.
[1311.32 → 1312.10] And we thank you, Lord.
[1312.22 → 1314.88] That you are the one who overcomes.
[1315.96 → 1318.16] You are the one who brings peace.
[1318.26 → 1319.54] And we get to join in.
[1320.36 → 1323.72] We get to contribute to the wholeness of shalom.
[1324.70 → 1326.64] Help us to do that in our families.
[1326.90 → 1328.54] In our lives.
[1328.60 → 1329.44] In our workplaces.
[1329.66 → 1330.80] In our community around us.
[1330.84 → 1333.14] Help us to be people who bring peace.
[1333.14 → 1336.12] But not just for the ceasing of conflict.
[1336.52 → 1337.46] But for something deeper.
[1337.62 → 1337.94] For you.
[1338.76 → 1340.74] For you are our peace.
[1341.82 → 1343.02] And may we cling to you.
[1343.06 → 1343.92] And hold on to you.
[1344.22 → 1345.34] Even when there's trouble.
[1345.46 → 1346.38] Even when life is hard.
[1346.48 → 1347.34] Even when it's chaotic.
[1347.82 → 1349.24] Knowing that you have overcome.
[1350.12 → 1352.32] And you have come to bring peace now.
[1352.88 → 1353.58] And forever.
[1353.94 → 1354.60] In Jesus name.
[1355.20 → 1355.44] Amen.
