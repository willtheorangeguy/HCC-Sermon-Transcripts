[0.00 --> 8.00]  Good morning, Hope community.
[9.56 --> 15.90]  It's good to be with you, and I want to start off thanking you, Candy and I, for all the
[15.90 --> 18.88]  condolences with the passing of my mom.
[20.38 --> 21.50]  She's a wonderful mom.
[22.42 --> 29.18]  My sister, in the end, when she was near the end of her life, my mom had her eyes closed
[29.18 --> 33.36]  and my sister said to her, Mom, just go see Jesus now.
[34.56 --> 37.78]  And she suddenly perked up and she started singing, Jesus Loves Me.
[39.32 --> 41.62]  And it's a gift.
[42.52 --> 43.26]  It's a gift.
[43.40 --> 49.44]  So she'll be missed, but she's with the Lord now and all better again.
[49.44 --> 51.00]  So a lovely thing.
[52.02 --> 53.64]  It is a gift to be in community.
[55.36 --> 58.92]  Today we are continuing our series on the Holy Spirit.
[59.18 --> 64.90]  And last week, Pastor Dave read about the coming of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost and
[64.90 --> 70.84]  the wind and the tongues of fire and God's presence coming on those who believed.
[71.64 --> 77.06]  Filling them, filling us, filling our relationships with one another, filling our lives, becoming
[77.06 --> 78.40]  a new humanity.
[78.60 --> 79.60]  That's what's going on.
[79.60 --> 84.32]  And we become more loving, more forgiving, more generous, and the church is equipped to
[84.32 --> 85.90]  reach the world with God's love.
[87.24 --> 88.86]  That's the influence of the Holy Spirit.
[90.32 --> 95.22]  And then Pastor Dave in his sermon asks us individually and collectively, why do we limp
[95.22 --> 96.44]  along in our own strength?
[96.58 --> 101.84]  Why don't we ask for the power of the Holy Spirit to work in us and through us?
[101.84 --> 105.50]  And I've been thinking a lot about that.
[106.66 --> 109.02]  So how do we cooperate with the Spirit?
[109.48 --> 111.66]  How do we even understand the Spirit?
[112.56 --> 117.28]  I was reading about a guy named John Ullman, and he suggested that the importance of any matter
[117.28 --> 120.90]  can be measured by the difficulty in defining it.
[120.90 --> 128.52]  And then he mentioned Louis Armstrong once said of jazz, he said, if I have to explain it
[128.52 --> 130.00]  to you, you ain't got it.
[131.48 --> 135.76]  It kind of feels that way a little bit too when we try to talk about something profound
[135.76 --> 137.26]  and like the Holy Spirit.
[138.58 --> 144.68]  John 3, verse, I'm just trying to find here, there we go.
[144.68 --> 152.72]  In John 3, verse 8, Scripture says, the wind blows wherever it pleases.
[153.48 --> 157.14]  You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it's going.
[157.46 --> 160.02]  So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.
[160.42 --> 163.02]  And we have this sense of power and yet mystery.
[163.72 --> 167.54]  But Scripture is, it does say quite a lot about the Spirit too, and His work in us and
[167.54 --> 168.10]  through us.
[168.44 --> 173.32]  And so we're going to look a little bit at that and how the Spirit helps us build the
[173.32 --> 175.94]  kingdom and helps us live out kingdom life.
[177.74 --> 182.76]  A few weeks ago, Pastor Dave talked about the kingdom as being the reign of Jesus in
[182.76 --> 183.26]  our lives.
[183.70 --> 187.92]  The rule of God where the Holy Spirit brings righteousness and peace and joy.
[188.20 --> 192.72]  Where we learn to live out, thy kingdom come, thy will be done.
[193.40 --> 199.82]  So I picked a passage out of Romans, and it probably wasn't the most obvious passage to
[199.82 --> 200.10]  pick.
[200.10 --> 205.56]  But what struck me about the passage was that the Holy Spirit comes to real people living
[205.56 --> 208.42]  real life with real situations.
[209.52 --> 211.82]  And so that's why I kind of like this passage.
[212.24 --> 217.98]  In this passage, there's a lot of stuff going on with that community about what you can and
[217.98 --> 220.48]  cannot eat for religious reasons.
[220.82 --> 225.22]  And there's lots of disagreement about that, and they're having some issues.
[225.22 --> 227.76]  I imagine God's people having issues.
[227.86 --> 230.60]  But anyway, that happens.
[231.28 --> 234.78]  So let's look at it together where we read Romans 14.
[235.34 --> 238.26]  Therefore, let us stop passing judgment on one another.
[239.20 --> 243.70]  Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother
[243.70 --> 244.54]  or sister.
[245.42 --> 251.62]  I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself.
[251.62 --> 255.82]  But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person, it is unclean.
[256.10 --> 259.80]  And he's kind of going with the logic here that some of these food rules, you know, it
[259.80 --> 262.56]  was okay to eat it, but if you thought it was wrong, you better not eat it, right?
[262.72 --> 266.20]  And so it's kind of, yeah, it's an interesting approach.
[267.06 --> 270.82]  If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, so now you're kind of doing
[270.82 --> 273.62]  something they don't want you to do, you're no longer acting in love.
[274.02 --> 277.38]  Do not, by your eating, destroy someone for whom Christ died.
[277.38 --> 281.90]  And I thought, wouldn't that be a fascinating way to approach our differences sometime?
[282.74 --> 282.94]  Right?
[282.96 --> 286.76]  We have a difference, you see it differently, and I'm going to win an argument, or I'm going
[286.76 --> 290.22]  to say, wow, I'm not going to get in the way of this person whom Christ died for.
[290.44 --> 293.08]  It would just change the dynamics quite a bit, wouldn't it?
[294.84 --> 300.12]  Therefore, do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil.
[300.74 --> 305.30]  And then this, for the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating or drinking, whatever
[305.30 --> 310.66]  the issue might be, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
[312.80 --> 315.28]  That is the evidence of the Holy Spirit.
[315.38 --> 317.74]  We're going to see more righteousness, more peace, more joy.
[317.96 --> 322.50]  Because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval.
[323.00 --> 328.34]  Let us, therefore, make every effort to do what leads to peace and mutual edification.
[329.34 --> 332.94]  Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food.
[332.94 --> 337.22]  All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
[337.56 --> 342.64]  And you see the work of the Spirit, that righteousness, that peace, that joy, but you see it played out
[342.64 --> 343.88]  relationally.
[345.92 --> 346.94]  Somehow there's…
[347.50 --> 349.26]  You're working around conflict.
[349.90 --> 351.88]  You love the person.
[352.14 --> 356.82]  You're trying to make things so that there is more peace, more joy, more righteousness.
[356.82 --> 367.72]  If you and me are to help build God's kingdom in our lives, then we don't want to put stumbling blocks or hindrances in a way.
[368.02 --> 373.64]  And sometimes I see that happen in Christian community where, you know, the issues become the thing.
[374.96 --> 376.84]  And we're always fighting about something.
[376.84 --> 383.68]  And the Holy Spirit is bringing something else.
[384.42 --> 390.64]  And I'm not saying there isn't a place to be debating and to try to understand what is God's will.
[390.66 --> 392.00]  I'm not saying that.
[392.26 --> 394.82]  I'm just saying our attitude sometime.
[396.12 --> 396.24]  Right?
[396.30 --> 401.84]  I'm putting a stumbling block that's different than we're talking together because I love you and I just want…
[401.84 --> 404.02]  Let's wrestle with stuff together out of love.
[404.02 --> 407.02]  There's this idea, you know, I'm going to win this argument.
[408.34 --> 410.64]  And I don't care about you in the process.
[412.10 --> 413.82]  That is not the work of the Holy Spirit.
[418.66 --> 422.98]  As I said, Paul was referring to rules around what we can and cannot be eaten.
[423.30 --> 424.28]  That was a big issue.
[425.40 --> 432.88]  The kingdom of God, he says, is not a matter about eating or drinking, but righteousness, peace, and then joy in the Holy Spirit.
[432.88 --> 436.88]  So, if your brother is grieved by…
[436.88 --> 440.46]  And these were the food laws, but you can put other issues in there if you want.
[440.70 --> 442.42]  You are no longer walking in love.
[443.56 --> 446.92]  You are no longer walking in the Spirit.
[447.80 --> 451.38]  Because that person is one whom Christ died for.
[451.58 --> 454.68]  Do you still see that when debating the issues?
[454.68 --> 465.28]  What the kingdom produces through the work of the Spirit is something deeper and larger than your liberty to eat all the things you want to eat.
[465.74 --> 468.04]  And I don't care about anybody else.
[469.70 --> 473.72]  And so, your relationship with each other best displays the work of the Spirit.
[473.72 --> 476.74]  Then we'll see the evidence of the peace and the joy and the righteousness.
[477.12 --> 480.56]  Evidence of the Holy Spirit at work in you.
[484.58 --> 488.28]  A practical, lived-out righteousness that leads to peace and joy.
[489.06 --> 491.16]  With the Holy Spirit, we are made more peaceable.
[491.34 --> 495.16]  We're made more joyful and more desirous of righteousness.
[495.90 --> 500.00]  Paul says, that's the kingdom of God at work through the work of the Holy Spirit.
[500.00 --> 503.52]  The reign of God is exercised through the Spirit in that way.
[504.06 --> 512.68]  And then, our selfishness and our pride are conquered and replaced by Christ-likeness, even and especially in our relationships.
[515.42 --> 520.66]  So then, Holy Spirit, then what we read here in Hope Community Church, in verse 19, it says,
[520.86 --> 524.60]  Then let us pursue what makes for peace and mutual up-building.
[525.14 --> 526.34]  We pursue it.
[526.34 --> 530.04]  Kingdom-building is building into the lives of others.
[531.36 --> 534.70]  Now, let me say something that probably sounds a little strange.
[536.04 --> 538.44]  The Holy Spirit is not a life hack.
[541.04 --> 545.86]  It's not a shortcut to avoid responsibility.
[546.94 --> 547.98]  Let me illustrate.
[547.98 --> 557.70]  I read an article about a court case in the United States about whether a juror in a criminal trial was allowed to wave aside evidence
[557.70 --> 561.38]  and rely totally just on what the Holy Spirit told them.
[563.88 --> 565.96]  Kind of a strange case, isn't it?
[567.06 --> 573.50]  A strange case to be sure, but it raises the question about what the Spirit-led life looks like.
[573.50 --> 580.60]  And too many Christians, I feel, have come to think of the Spirit as kind of an ultimate life hack,
[580.86 --> 587.12]  a means of avoiding pain, of eliminating difficulty, of assuring success.
[587.12 --> 596.78]  And then believers become more absorbed in their own experiences and less concerned about the brothers and sisters around them.
[600.30 --> 606.82]  Jacques Ellou, a Christian philosopher, argues that the Spirit does not coerce or control us,
[607.06 --> 610.98]  but frees us and empowers us to live wise, caring lives.
[611.20 --> 612.90]  That's why I like that passage in Rome, right?
[612.90 --> 616.74]  It leads to peace and joy in relationships.
[617.88 --> 624.86]  The Spirit enlivens our conscience, allowing us to discern God's will, preventing us from taking refuge in ignorance.
[625.02 --> 628.14]  The Spirit makes us fully responsible.
[630.72 --> 637.98]  You know, we saw that in Acts 2 with Peter and the disciples declaring the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.
[637.98 --> 646.30]  And so there they were at that incredible day of Pentecost and people wondering what was going on and all that stuff.
[646.42 --> 648.90]  But years later, there's Peter.
[650.08 --> 655.02]  And they're struggling with Jews and Gentiles.
[655.68 --> 658.02]  They're still struggling with that stuff and the food rules and all that.
[658.02 --> 660.96]  And years later, Peter has a vision from God.
[661.70 --> 667.02]  And the sheet's coming down and on that sheet is a bunch of food and all that food is unclean food according to Jewish law.
[668.24 --> 669.22]  Old Testament law.
[670.68 --> 672.90]  And a voice says to Peter,
[673.68 --> 674.02]  Eat!
[675.26 --> 677.30]  And Peter says, I can't eat that stuff.
[677.42 --> 678.80]  It is unclean.
[678.80 --> 687.42]  And then God says, don't call anything impure that God has made clean.
[688.98 --> 702.30]  Peter is invited to take flight with the Holy Spirit into an uncharted world where the distinction between holy and unclean have been fundamentally upended.
[703.56 --> 706.46]  At least according to the way we often define.
[706.46 --> 711.84]  God, and we go on here from Will Jennings, he said,
[711.94 --> 716.80]  God works in and from tight spaces, intimate settings of family and close friends,
[716.94 --> 720.22]  to change wide open spaces of peoples and nations.
[720.54 --> 723.60]  Peter is now caught up in the revelation of the intimate.
[724.28 --> 728.88]  God has pushed him over the line that separated Jewish bodies from Gentile bodies,
[729.34 --> 732.26]  holy bodies from unholy ones.
[732.26 --> 745.64]  And you see where Peter had gotten caught up in the rules of food at the expense of relationships with people.
[747.64 --> 753.40]  The kingdom is being built through the transforming work of the Holy Spirit.
[753.40 --> 756.54]  And we don't always know what that looks like.
[757.06 --> 758.74]  But we are being led.
[760.28 --> 767.20]  We who live in the Spirit will be free for responsibility, not free from it.
[769.36 --> 774.16]  Brothers and sisters will matter more to us than winning an argument.
[774.16 --> 779.94]  And we are free in the Spirit to nurture the common good and care for our neighbors.
[781.34 --> 785.50]  Gordon Fee talks about heaven coming down, not in a spatial sense,
[785.78 --> 789.36]  but as a foretaste of a promised future that we're going to have.
[789.92 --> 798.02]  And in all its wholeness and beauty, this heavenly invasion has invaded planet Earth by means of the Holy Spirit.
[798.02 --> 804.52]  And the church is the arena in which that heavenly invasion plays itself out.
[805.82 --> 807.92]  Do you see the church that way?
[809.22 --> 811.06]  Or is it just a Sunday thing?
[814.42 --> 817.82]  And this isn't about becoming so heavenly minded that we're of no earthly good.
[818.04 --> 819.88]  Actually, the very opposite of that.
[820.22 --> 825.82]  The very power that raised Jesus from the dead is available to us.
[825.82 --> 827.54]  Do you believe that?
[828.02 --> 833.82]  And therefore, the church should live differently from the world.
[834.18 --> 835.14]  Fee goes on, and I quote,
[835.30 --> 841.32]  We throw ourselves into the present precisely because we know the future is assured.
[843.04 --> 847.08]  We don't have to stress about the future because God is already in it.
[847.90 --> 851.56]  Living rightfully before one another is not a matter of doing our duty,
[851.56 --> 856.80]  but the long life of heaven, living life of heaven now.
[856.80 --> 859.64]  So, yeah, we are in that in-between, right?
[859.74 --> 861.66]  The kingdom come and the kingdom coming.
[862.16 --> 864.32]  I like Paul writes about salvation, for example.
[864.58 --> 866.80]  In Ephesians, he says, we have been saved.
[867.10 --> 869.30]  In 1 Corinthians, he says, are being saved.
[869.44 --> 871.14]  In Romans, he says, we shall be saved.
[871.36 --> 871.48]  Right?
[871.52 --> 875.08]  This is a process of salvation, of whole of life.
[875.08 --> 879.94]  So, yeah, we live with the tension of the kingdom now and not yet.
[880.26 --> 883.64]  But we live in the power of the Holy Spirit now.
[883.64 --> 891.70]  I was reading a little bit out of the book of Ezekiel.
[893.36 --> 895.36]  It's kind of a crazy book sometimes.
[896.38 --> 898.82]  He's the one who does this wheel within the wheel within a wheel
[898.82 --> 901.98]  and has all these wild visions and pretty fascinating.
[901.98 --> 908.46]  But he has a vision at one point of the Spirit leaving the temple.
[908.56 --> 913.68]  Israel or Judah was in trouble and they were being invaded
[913.68 --> 917.20]  because they had been disobedient and not following the Lord's will.
[917.68 --> 921.74]  And God withdraws his Spirit from the temple from Jerusalem.
[922.64 --> 924.76]  And we read that in Ezekiel 10.
[924.76 --> 928.38]  Then the glory of the Lord departed from over the threshold of the temple
[928.38 --> 930.74]  and stopped above the cherubim.
[931.20 --> 933.14]  And suddenly we say, ooh, the Spirit's gone.
[934.52 --> 935.18]  Oh, no.
[935.60 --> 936.18]  Now what?
[937.34 --> 937.60]  Right?
[937.74 --> 940.16]  And then there's a promise that the Spirit's going to come back.
[940.68 --> 942.34]  And how does the Spirit come back?
[942.54 --> 947.46]  Well, I'm going to jump ahead to 1 Corinthians where it says,
[947.88 --> 949.38]  Do you not know?
[949.80 --> 951.64]  This is Paul who knows that early history.
[951.64 --> 955.22]  Do you not know that you yourself are God's temple
[955.22 --> 958.50]  and that God's Holy Spirit dwells in you?
[961.66 --> 966.66]  When you look at each other, you see the temple of the Holy Spirit.
[970.48 --> 975.08]  God kept his promise and his presence has returned to his temple.
[975.34 --> 981.16]  Only this time the temple is you, me, the church.
[982.40 --> 985.26]  And too often the church forgets that.
[986.16 --> 989.36]  You, me, we are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit.
[989.68 --> 995.86]  And when we gather into the sanctuary together, we are God's temple together.
[997.50 --> 999.32]  I mean, that's unbelievable and amazing.
[999.86 --> 1004.36]  I was thinking about that and I remembered a quote from Anne Lamott.
[1005.10 --> 1006.58]  She's written a number of interesting books.
[1006.58 --> 1009.76]  But she describes the church this way.
[1010.08 --> 1012.70]  It's a little dated, but I like how she says it.
[1014.00 --> 1014.62]  She says this,
[1014.72 --> 1019.80]  Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we so blithely invoke?
[1020.44 --> 1023.00]  Or as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it?
[1024.06 --> 1025.58]  The churches, now picture this,
[1025.84 --> 1029.98]  the churches are children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets,
[1030.42 --> 1033.42]  mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning.
[1033.42 --> 1035.90]  It's madness.
[1036.12 --> 1037.44]  And when people used to wear hats to church,
[1037.64 --> 1040.68]  it's madness to wear ladies' straw hats and velvet hats to church.
[1040.94 --> 1042.84]  We should all be wearing crash helmets.
[1043.18 --> 1045.76]  Ushers should be issuing life preservers and signal flares.
[1046.10 --> 1048.34]  They should lash us into our pews.
[1048.34 --> 1051.30]  Why does he say that?
[1051.48 --> 1052.12]  Or she say that?
[1052.50 --> 1052.64]  Right?
[1052.82 --> 1054.80]  Because this is a place of power.
[1056.08 --> 1060.30]  This isn't a place to park yourself for an hour once a week.
[1060.52 --> 1063.86]  This is a place of power at work through us.
[1065.46 --> 1068.20]  In our marriages, with our children, in our community.
[1068.68 --> 1071.34]  This is God's power at work.
[1071.34 --> 1083.52]  The church forgets who they are and who empowers them.
[1084.70 --> 1088.36]  And we should sense the awesomeness of God's presence.
[1091.78 --> 1093.58]  I don't know if that hits you sometime.
[1093.58 --> 1099.08]  You know, it's not the building.
[1099.26 --> 1099.78]  It's the temples.
[1100.86 --> 1101.04]  Right?
[1101.22 --> 1102.58]  The Holy Spirit is with us.
[1103.24 --> 1105.06]  And when we sense that awesomeness,
[1105.28 --> 1107.02]  yeah, we have a sense of our own worthiness,
[1107.20 --> 1108.76]  yet with a profound sense of joy,
[1108.98 --> 1110.84]  that it is through grace that I am here,
[1111.14 --> 1111.98]  that I belong here,
[1112.06 --> 1113.06]  and that I am powered.
[1113.74 --> 1114.78]  Reverence and joy.
[1115.16 --> 1117.10]  The living God is a God of power.
[1117.46 --> 1118.96]  And His Spirit, the living God,
[1119.00 --> 1120.54]  is present with us and for us,
[1120.54 --> 1122.10]  and He fills us to use us.
[1125.86 --> 1127.34]  1 Corinthians 12, we read,
[1127.68 --> 1129.56]  we are all baptized by one Spirit,
[1129.96 --> 1131.56]  so as to form one body.
[1132.48 --> 1134.14]  Whether Jews or Gentiles,
[1134.32 --> 1135.94]  none of those stumbling blocks,
[1136.20 --> 1137.48]  Jews or Gentiles, slave or free,
[1137.72 --> 1139.58]  we're all given the one Spirit to drink.
[1143.04 --> 1144.84]  The force of the gospel is seen
[1144.84 --> 1146.96]  in how the many become one.
[1147.24 --> 1149.78]  The body is unified by the one and the same Spirit.
[1149.78 --> 1151.96]  Our interdependence is seen
[1151.96 --> 1154.52]  in Paul's relentless use
[1154.52 --> 1155.72]  of the Greek word,
[1156.04 --> 1157.84]  all along, each other.
[1158.12 --> 1159.60]  Everything is done, all along.
[1160.26 --> 1162.60]  And it's why the brother and sister
[1162.60 --> 1164.18]  matter so much to each of us,
[1164.22 --> 1165.06]  or at least should.
[1165.58 --> 1166.88]  You care, and here's a bunch of
[1166.88 --> 1168.84]  one another from the Scriptures.
[1169.24 --> 1170.42]  You care for one another.
[1170.82 --> 1171.56]  Love one another.
[1172.14 --> 1173.80]  Pursue one another's good.
[1173.88 --> 1174.38]  I like that one.
[1175.08 --> 1176.14]  Bear with one another.
[1176.30 --> 1177.12]  Yeah, sometimes that too.
[1177.50 --> 1178.54]  Be kind to one another.
[1178.66 --> 1179.32]  Forgive one another.
[1179.32 --> 1180.18]  Submit to one another.
[1180.34 --> 1182.06]  Live in harmony with one another.
[1182.60 --> 1184.14]  This is life in the Spirit.
[1184.76 --> 1186.42]  This reflects the kingdom of God
[1186.42 --> 1187.02]  come and coming.
[1190.14 --> 1191.24]  Because we are members
[1191.24 --> 1192.88]  of one another.
[1194.18 --> 1196.20]  The Spirit unifies us
[1196.20 --> 1197.78]  and empowers us.
[1199.00 --> 1199.72]  Gordon Fee says,
[1199.72 --> 1201.86]  we find our individual significance
[1201.86 --> 1203.50]  as we live it out
[1203.50 --> 1206.76]  with people whom we may not always like
[1206.76 --> 1208.22]  or feel comfortable with,
[1208.40 --> 1209.34]  but whom we love
[1209.34 --> 1211.26]  in a new kind of way.
[1211.26 --> 1212.26]  joy and peace.
[1212.26 --> 1219.76]  And that's joy and peace found in the Spirit
[1219.76 --> 1221.04]  as expressed in relationships.
[1222.30 --> 1223.34]  And Paul says,
[1223.54 --> 1225.18]  they will be one in Christ.
[1225.48 --> 1225.88]  Jew,
[1226.48 --> 1227.00]  Gentile,
[1227.78 --> 1228.08]  free,
[1228.50 --> 1228.94]  slave,
[1229.46 --> 1229.78]  male,
[1230.18 --> 1230.56]  female,
[1231.46 --> 1231.88]  one.
[1231.88 --> 1233.44]  God's vision for the church
[1233.44 --> 1234.98]  is not that those
[1234.98 --> 1235.64]  who are comfortable
[1235.64 --> 1236.14]  with one another
[1236.14 --> 1236.78]  may be one,
[1237.12 --> 1238.66]  but that those who differ,
[1238.82 --> 1239.68]  those who disagree,
[1240.04 --> 1240.86]  those who live differently
[1240.86 --> 1242.84]  may be one through the Spirit.
[1244.46 --> 1245.74]  That's God's kingdom come
[1245.74 --> 1246.82]  and coming.
[1246.82 --> 1248.62]  In fact,
[1248.86 --> 1250.04]  this embrace of one another
[1250.04 --> 1251.00]  was to be the brand
[1251.00 --> 1252.34]  that identified
[1252.34 --> 1253.14]  and distinguished
[1253.14 --> 1254.18]  the Christian movement,
[1254.86 --> 1256.30]  pointing to the kingdom
[1256.30 --> 1256.96]  come and coming.
[1257.98 --> 1258.58]  And sadly,
[1258.76 --> 1259.26]  too often,
[1259.40 --> 1260.42]  we don't reflect the kingdom
[1260.42 --> 1260.86]  very well.
[1261.10 --> 1262.08]  And there's too much fighting
[1262.08 --> 1262.52]  going on,
[1262.58 --> 1263.26]  there's too much arguing
[1263.26 --> 1263.82]  going on,
[1263.92 --> 1265.76]  and we create little growth
[1265.76 --> 1267.54]  because we aren't working
[1267.54 --> 1268.68]  in cooperation
[1268.68 --> 1269.56]  with the Spirit,
[1269.80 --> 1270.60]  we're working out
[1270.60 --> 1271.32]  our own agendas
[1271.32 --> 1271.92]  too often.
[1271.92 --> 1277.32]  The Holy Spirit
[1277.32 --> 1278.34]  says,
[1278.50 --> 1279.64]  I want you to see
[1279.64 --> 1280.42]  the way I see.
[1281.52 --> 1282.36]  I want you to look
[1282.36 --> 1283.20]  at life through
[1283.20 --> 1285.82]  my power
[1285.82 --> 1286.70]  and my eyes.
[1288.14 --> 1288.38]  Yeah,
[1288.52 --> 1289.62]  and then we see our sins
[1289.62 --> 1290.62]  and our need for grace.
[1291.14 --> 1292.16]  And then we are united
[1292.16 --> 1292.78]  in Christ
[1292.78 --> 1294.82]  and so changing us
[1294.82 --> 1296.06]  at the center of our being
[1296.06 --> 1297.30]  to become more like Christ,
[1297.62 --> 1298.52]  unified in Him.
[1298.88 --> 1300.28]  Christians need not ask
[1300.28 --> 1300.90]  whether they have
[1300.90 --> 1301.54]  the Holy Spirit.
[1301.54 --> 1303.50]  J.I. Packer writes,
[1303.74 --> 1304.48]  every Christian
[1304.48 --> 1305.26]  has the Spirit
[1305.26 --> 1306.14]  from the moment
[1306.14 --> 1307.28]  of his or her believing.
[1307.76 --> 1309.16]  But it might not hurt
[1309.16 --> 1309.90]  to ask,
[1310.60 --> 1311.06]  instead,
[1311.32 --> 1312.06]  does the Spirit
[1312.06 --> 1313.02]  have you?
[1315.38 --> 1316.14]  I don't like that.
[1317.64 --> 1319.02]  Am I submitting?
[1319.72 --> 1320.70]  Am I surrendering?
[1322.14 --> 1323.28]  Am I getting in the way
[1323.28 --> 1324.40]  or not?
[1326.20 --> 1327.22]  And I think we see
[1327.22 --> 1327.92]  the Spirit at work
[1327.92 --> 1329.12]  when we admit
[1329.12 --> 1330.14]  that we're too weak.
[1331.54 --> 1333.06]  Paul says it rather well
[1333.06 --> 1334.46]  when he wrestles
[1334.46 --> 1335.22]  with his own weaknesses
[1335.22 --> 1335.70]  and he says
[1335.70 --> 1336.74]  in 2 Corinthians 12,
[1337.16 --> 1337.42]  he said,
[1337.58 --> 1338.82]  but God said to me,
[1339.12 --> 1340.40]  my grace is sufficient
[1340.40 --> 1340.86]  for you.
[1341.10 --> 1342.44]  My power is made perfect.
[1342.60 --> 1342.88]  How?
[1343.06 --> 1343.78]  In weakness.
[1344.16 --> 1344.52]  Therefore,
[1344.68 --> 1345.18]  I will boast
[1345.18 --> 1345.92]  all the more gladly
[1345.92 --> 1346.76]  about my weaknesses
[1346.76 --> 1348.08]  so that Christ's power
[1348.08 --> 1348.86]  may rest on me.
[1349.26 --> 1350.12]  That is why,
[1350.22 --> 1350.92]  for Christ's sake,
[1351.06 --> 1352.64]  I delight in weaknesses,
[1353.00 --> 1353.68]  in insults,
[1353.76 --> 1354.32]  in hardship,
[1354.58 --> 1355.26]  in persecution,
[1355.46 --> 1356.18]  in difficulties.
[1356.18 --> 1357.46]  For when I am weak,
[1357.70 --> 1358.74]  then I am strong
[1358.74 --> 1360.24]  in the Spirit.
[1364.74 --> 1365.58]  In the Spirit.
[1368.04 --> 1368.54]  You know,
[1368.58 --> 1369.40]  it made me think of Peter.
[1370.98 --> 1371.42]  Right?
[1372.32 --> 1372.96]  Peter's always
[1372.96 --> 1374.06]  a favorite of mine.
[1375.56 --> 1377.44]  He's got so much enthusiasm
[1377.44 --> 1379.34]  and at the same time
[1379.34 --> 1380.12]  he's such a mess.
[1380.12 --> 1382.14]  And so I guess
[1382.14 --> 1383.04]  I kind of relate to him.
[1385.52 --> 1386.46]  And I was reading
[1386.46 --> 1386.92]  this one story
[1386.92 --> 1387.70]  where Peter and
[1387.70 --> 1388.78]  some of the disciples
[1388.78 --> 1389.32]  are on the way
[1389.32 --> 1389.86]  to the temple
[1389.86 --> 1391.44]  and there's this
[1391.44 --> 1393.96]  road that they're
[1393.96 --> 1394.58]  walking down
[1394.58 --> 1395.28]  and there's this guy
[1395.28 --> 1395.88]  that's always been
[1395.88 --> 1396.34]  sitting there.
[1396.76 --> 1397.32]  He's lame.
[1397.46 --> 1398.38]  He's been lame for years.
[1398.46 --> 1399.00]  He's been sitting there
[1399.00 --> 1399.42]  for years.
[1400.34 --> 1402.08]  And suddenly that day,
[1403.12 --> 1403.64]  Peter stops
[1403.64 --> 1404.44]  and they heal him.
[1405.62 --> 1406.80]  And then this reaction
[1406.80 --> 1407.70]  out of Acts 3.
[1408.38 --> 1409.14]  While the man
[1409.14 --> 1409.74]  who's healed
[1409.74 --> 1411.14]  held on to Peter and John,
[1411.38 --> 1411.94]  all the people
[1411.94 --> 1412.48]  were astonished
[1412.48 --> 1413.42]  and came running to them
[1413.42 --> 1414.26]  in the place
[1414.26 --> 1415.76]  called Solomon's Colonnade.
[1416.10 --> 1417.10]  And when Peter saw this,
[1417.14 --> 1417.58]  he said to them,
[1417.72 --> 1418.54]  fellow Israelites,
[1418.86 --> 1419.90]  why does this
[1419.90 --> 1421.12]  surprise you?
[1421.94 --> 1423.26]  Why do you stare at us
[1423.26 --> 1425.16]  as if by our own power
[1425.16 --> 1425.68]  and godliness
[1425.68 --> 1427.46]  we had made this man
[1427.46 --> 1428.80]  walk?
[1433.06 --> 1433.56]  You know,
[1433.58 --> 1434.10]  I was thinking about it.
[1434.10 --> 1434.94]  Maybe Jesus
[1434.94 --> 1435.82]  passed this guy by.
[1437.02 --> 1437.16]  Right?
[1437.18 --> 1437.92]  He'd been around
[1437.92 --> 1438.64]  for a lot of years.
[1439.74 --> 1440.54]  But in this moment,
[1440.62 --> 1441.14]  he's healed
[1441.14 --> 1442.26]  and he went leaping
[1442.26 --> 1443.56]  and praising God.
[1443.86 --> 1444.60]  He went to the temple
[1444.60 --> 1444.90]  that way.
[1445.22 --> 1446.60]  And we receive a glimpse
[1446.60 --> 1447.40]  of the kingdom
[1447.40 --> 1448.66]  come and coming,
[1448.96 --> 1449.64]  a foretaste
[1449.64 --> 1451.04]  of all that will come.
[1451.84 --> 1452.90]  And I love that line.
[1453.60 --> 1455.10]  Why does this surprise you?
[1455.14 --> 1455.68]  And I'm sure everyone
[1455.68 --> 1455.88]  would say,
[1456.02 --> 1457.90]  the lame guy's walking.
[1458.04 --> 1458.96]  Shouldn't we be surprised?
[1458.96 --> 1467.58]  And the Spirit wills.
[1467.90 --> 1468.94]  That's the Spirit wills.
[1469.82 --> 1470.96]  And he uses broken,
[1471.16 --> 1471.74]  messy people
[1471.74 --> 1472.78]  like Peter.
[1473.62 --> 1475.36]  People looking on
[1475.36 --> 1475.64]  will say,
[1475.74 --> 1475.98]  wow.
[1476.46 --> 1476.68]  You know,
[1476.70 --> 1477.60]  when they see people
[1477.60 --> 1478.36]  like Peter being used,
[1478.40 --> 1478.50]  they say,
[1478.56 --> 1478.78]  wow,
[1479.24 --> 1480.32]  that must be God
[1480.32 --> 1480.86]  because we know what,
[1480.94 --> 1481.72]  he doesn't do
[1481.72 --> 1482.30]  these kind of things.
[1482.74 --> 1483.74]  If you're a person
[1483.74 --> 1484.70]  who thinks that you've
[1484.70 --> 1485.50]  got the right stuff,
[1485.80 --> 1486.28]  God will probably
[1486.28 --> 1487.04]  need to humble you
[1487.04 --> 1487.94]  before he uses you.
[1488.98 --> 1490.32]  You need to know
[1490.32 --> 1491.54]  it's about God's Spirit
[1491.54 --> 1492.62]  at work in you
[1492.62 --> 1493.82]  and in your weaknesses
[1493.82 --> 1495.70]  because it's not about you.
[1498.28 --> 1499.46]  St. Augustine said it
[1499.46 --> 1499.80]  this way.
[1499.90 --> 1499.98]  He said,
[1500.06 --> 1500.66]  the way to Christ
[1500.66 --> 1501.94]  is first through humility,
[1502.56 --> 1503.94]  second through humility,
[1504.42 --> 1506.56]  and third through humility.
[1509.00 --> 1510.06]  That's life in the Spirit.
[1510.88 --> 1512.30]  He builds God's kingdom,
[1512.56 --> 1512.98]  not us.
[1513.90 --> 1514.98]  And he longs to work
[1514.98 --> 1516.02]  in you and through you.
[1517.04 --> 1518.00]  Peter knew this
[1518.00 --> 1518.98]  with this healing.
[1519.28 --> 1519.40]  He said,
[1519.50 --> 1520.28]  this isn't about me.
[1520.56 --> 1521.58]  This should encourage you
[1521.58 --> 1521.88]  and, yes,
[1522.04 --> 1522.50]  scare you.
[1522.78 --> 1523.88]  God wants to use you.
[1523.98 --> 1524.92]  God wants to empower you
[1524.92 --> 1525.94]  to help build his kingdom,
[1526.12 --> 1526.74]  whatever that's going
[1526.74 --> 1527.32]  to look like.
[1527.84 --> 1528.66]  Peter knew this.
[1528.74 --> 1528.84]  I mean,
[1529.02 --> 1529.86]  he had denied Jesus
[1529.86 --> 1530.86]  three times, right?
[1531.04 --> 1532.20]  He had quit the mission.
[1532.64 --> 1533.12]  He would then,
[1533.30 --> 1533.70]  with Jesus,
[1533.80 --> 1534.32]  and Jesus said,
[1534.66 --> 1534.88]  Peter,
[1534.94 --> 1535.52]  do you love me?
[1535.68 --> 1536.52]  You don't remember that story.
[1536.58 --> 1536.76]  Peter,
[1536.80 --> 1537.28]  do you love me?
[1537.36 --> 1537.54]  Peter,
[1537.60 --> 1537.98]  do you love me?
[1537.98 --> 1538.52]  Three times.
[1538.68 --> 1539.34]  And Peter said,
[1539.38 --> 1539.54]  yes,
[1539.62 --> 1540.26]  you know I do.
[1540.32 --> 1540.52]  Yes,
[1540.58 --> 1541.02]  you know I do.
[1541.22 --> 1542.30]  Go feed my sheep.
[1542.36 --> 1542.64]  There we go.
[1542.68 --> 1543.76]  Now we're back on track.
[1547.04 --> 1548.66]  None of the followers
[1548.66 --> 1549.72]  were strong enough
[1549.72 --> 1550.76]  or gift enough.
[1550.94 --> 1552.52]  They hardly ever know
[1552.52 --> 1553.40]  what's going on.
[1555.60 --> 1556.74]  It always makes me laugh,
[1556.82 --> 1557.04]  kind of.
[1557.22 --> 1557.90]  You see it kind of
[1557.90 --> 1559.04]  pretty good in The Chosen.
[1559.28 --> 1559.54]  I don't know
[1559.54 --> 1560.20]  if you've been watching that.
[1560.26 --> 1560.72]  My wife and I
[1560.72 --> 1561.28]  have been watching it.
[1561.82 --> 1562.84]  But these guys
[1562.84 --> 1564.82]  are clueless sometimes.
[1566.14 --> 1566.70]  And so are we.
[1566.96 --> 1567.98]  And we should look at them
[1567.98 --> 1568.16]  and say,
[1568.24 --> 1568.44]  wow,
[1568.56 --> 1569.70]  if God can use them,
[1569.74 --> 1570.58]  I guess He can use me.
[1573.68 --> 1575.52]  And Peter goes from denier
[1575.52 --> 1577.86]  to Peter the rock,
[1579.14 --> 1580.70]  a work of the Spirit.
[1581.52 --> 1583.12]  And how powerful is He
[1583.12 --> 1584.80]  in the Spirit?
[1584.90 --> 1585.74]  How powerful are we
[1585.74 --> 1586.70]  in the Spirit?
[1586.88 --> 1587.02]  Well,
[1587.06 --> 1588.12]  look at Matthew 16.
[1589.60 --> 1590.18]  Jesus says,
[1590.24 --> 1591.00]  and I tell you,
[1591.18 --> 1591.92]  you are Peter,
[1591.92 --> 1593.20]  and on this rock
[1593.20 --> 1594.52]  I will build my church.
[1595.34 --> 1596.92]  And the gates of Hades,
[1597.04 --> 1598.24]  the gates of hell
[1598.24 --> 1599.38]  will not prevail.
[1599.38 --> 1605.66]  Nothing can stop
[1605.66 --> 1607.22]  the work of God
[1607.22 --> 1608.16]  through His Spirit
[1608.16 --> 1609.10]  in this world.
[1612.58 --> 1613.92]  And it's high time
[1613.92 --> 1615.88]  that we humbly stand up
[1615.88 --> 1617.60]  and we simply say,
[1617.72 --> 1617.98]  Lord,
[1619.26 --> 1620.02]  use even me.
[1621.70 --> 1622.66]  Use even me.
[1624.26 --> 1625.64]  To help be a part
[1625.64 --> 1626.48]  of your kingdom
[1626.48 --> 1627.70]  come and coming
[1627.70 --> 1628.94]  to be a blessing
[1628.94 --> 1630.08]  in this world.
[1630.98 --> 1631.56]  Let's pray.
[1634.18 --> 1634.78]  Father God,
[1634.82 --> 1635.52]  we come before You
[1635.52 --> 1636.38]  and we thank You for,
[1637.14 --> 1638.18]  we thank You for being
[1638.18 --> 1640.18]  a God who comes to us.
[1641.48 --> 1642.42]  You come to us
[1642.42 --> 1642.88]  through Your Son,
[1643.00 --> 1643.26]  Jesus.
[1644.02 --> 1645.34]  You sent Your Spirit
[1645.34 --> 1646.28]  to empower us.
[1646.78 --> 1647.94]  You keep showing up.
[1648.62 --> 1648.76]  Lord,
[1648.84 --> 1649.44]  might we learn
[1649.44 --> 1650.20]  to surrender
[1650.20 --> 1651.10]  to Your will
[1651.10 --> 1652.86]  and cooperate
[1652.86 --> 1653.84]  with Your Spirit
[1653.84 --> 1655.96]  so that You might use us
[1655.96 --> 1657.12]  in the building
[1657.12 --> 1657.74]  of Your kingdom,
[1657.88 --> 1658.64]  in our marriages,
[1659.10 --> 1659.76]  in our friendships,
[1660.06 --> 1660.94]  in our workplaces,
[1661.28 --> 1662.18]  in our neighborhoods.
[1662.56 --> 1662.70]  Lord,
[1662.86 --> 1663.60]  use us.
[1664.12 --> 1665.40]  Use us to be a blessing
[1665.40 --> 1666.92]  through Your power.
[1667.16 --> 1667.90]  In Jesus' name,
[1668.34 --> 1668.56]  Amen.
[1668.56 --> 1668.68]  Amen.
