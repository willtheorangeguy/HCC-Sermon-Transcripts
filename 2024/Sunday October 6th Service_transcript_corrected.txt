[0.00 → 12.72] the Holy Spirit amen
[14.24 → 14.72] good morning
[19.04 → 25.36] it's uh wonderful to be with you again this morning as we continue our series
[25.36 → 35.04] on contrast community where we're contrasting those who live by Christ versus those who live
[35.04 → 41.52] in their own strength and by values that they created on their own that we might call
[42.24 → 51.12] the world, and we ought to see a difference Jesus said it this way in john 13 when you see it up on
[51.12 → 57.36] the screen here a new commandment I give you love one another and then how do you love well as I have
[57.36 → 64.08] loved you so you must love one another by this everyone will know you're my disciples so by that
[64.08 → 69.20] if you love one another and I guess the question might be been we showing the difference
[70.88 → 74.88] are we showing the difference that Christ makes in the way we live
[74.88 → 85.52] I don't know if about you, but it seems to me that people um around us all around us, they seem angry
[86.24 → 94.16] upset we see it on the news all over social media sometimes at our family gatherings
[95.28 → 101.04] right and and and i I think it behind all this vitriol and behind all this hate is people living
[101.04 → 107.84] in fear Jesus vision of the church is one of a community of peace but we might want to ask
[107.84 → 114.48] ourselves well what does that look like I'm going to start off with a historical example of one group's
[114.48 → 122.08] reaction uh there's this guy in history named arsenics the great there he is good-looking guy
[123.52 → 128.00] anyway arsenics great lived in the fourth century he was the fourth century desert father
[128.00 → 133.28] and uh for those of you have never heard that term before you're going to hear a little bit more about
[133.28 → 144.40] it now he was born around 350 a.d his dad was a Roman senator he had wealth he had position in fact he
[144.40 → 152.88] even educated Caesar himself, and then he became a follower of Jesus he gave away all his wealth his
[152.88 → 161.36] position his home in the palace, and he moved to the deserts of North Africa imagine that eventually
[161.36 → 170.08] this became a community of tens of thousands of people a community seriously attempting to live out
[170.08 → 176.48] what it means to follow Jesus and some debate oh well did they escape or did they know create a new
[176.48 → 183.92] community we won't debate that now, but they did this to be a contrast to the way things were
[183.92 → 190.56] under emperor Constantine you've probably heard his name before who also had become a Christian and in
[190.56 → 196.88] fact made Christianity far more popular than it was under Constantine there were lots of people
[196.88 → 203.36] who suddenly became Christians because it was the thing to do some genuinely but some maybe not so
[203.36 → 210.32] and Christianity moved from a persecuted minority to a political majority
[212.80 → 221.36] and this caused all sorts of problems for the integrity of the church imagine that it became enmeshed
[221.36 → 224.96] with the empire that sound familiar
[227.52 → 233.28] and Arminius and hundreds of thousands of others fled the empire for the desert
[233.36 → 240.24] later as a very elderly man he had become famous because people came to see what he was all about
[240.24 → 246.72] he'd become famous for his wisdom his warmth his compassion so notice they didn't simply just escape
[246.72 → 251.92] they lived with a sense of influence as well, and he had a sense of what was called stability
[252.64 → 255.68] which really means nothing can move you
[255.68 → 264.00] stability nothing can move you when asked why he did all that he had done because he didn't have to
[264.00 → 271.92] do all that to be a follower of Jesus he said that one day as he was praying he prayed lord lead me in the
[271.92 → 278.40] way of salvation right not just let it be an act of conversion but an ongoing conversion a way of salvation and
[278.40 → 289.68] then he felt god saying arsenics flee be silent pray always for these are the sources of sinlessness
[293.76 → 302.56] what does that look like we live in a world of always being distracted we live in a world of lots of noise
[302.56 → 307.76] a guy named Robert Sarah had something to say about that it's a pretty long quote but I thought it was
[307.76 → 312.32] important so you'll see it up on the screen so you can read it too I was talking to somebody after the
[312.32 → 317.76] first service, and they said yeah it'd be nice to be able to look at these quotes for a while so if
[317.76 → 323.20] anybody wants it maybe I can send it to you or whatever but anyway um here's this what Robert Sarah
[323.20 → 329.68] had to say about this modern society can no longer do without the dictatorship of noise
[330.56 → 338.08] it allows us in an illusion of cheap democracy while snatching our freedom away with the subtle
[338.08 → 346.48] violence of the devil the father of lies without noise postmodern man falls into a dull insistent
[347.12 → 358.48] uneasiness he is accustomed to permanent background noise which sickens yet reassures him noise gives
[358.48 → 362.92] him security like a drug on which he has become dependent with its festive
[362.92 → 369.04] appearance noise of the whirlwind that avoids facing itself agitation becomes a
[369.04 → 374.92] tranquilizer a sedative a morphine but noise is a dangerous deceptive medicine
[374.92 → 382.48] a diabolical lie that helps man avoid confronting himself in his interior
[382.48 → 394.24] emptiness the awakening will necessarily be brutal that's a lot on the one hand this
[394.24 → 401.52] proliferation of noises is nothing new one of my favourite writers Henry Owen way back in the 70s
[401.52 → 408.40] he was a priest and a writer when he was driving through LA seeing all the signs everywhere you
[408.40 → 413.40] know he said everywhere I looked there were words trying to take my eyes from the road, and they said
[413.40 → 422.68] use me take me buy me drink me smell me touch me kiss me sleep with me words then contain little to no
[422.68 → 430.48] meaning, and we live in the information age, and I was thinking about that we have so much
[430.48 → 438.14] information and a lot less meaning the two don't necessarily go hand in hand
[438.14 → 445.82] now and called the noise the enemy of spiritual growth and I think those seniors and those
[445.82 → 453.22] desert fathers would agree after pastor Dave gave one of his quotes last week he said and that was
[453.22 → 457.24] before the computers and cell phones and so it was with that now one quote that I read to you
[457.24 → 465.34] the average person touches their phone 2,000 times per day they're on it three hours 15 minutes on
[465.34 → 474.10] average more if you're younger and not only is social media making us miserable it's making us worse
[474.10 → 481.24] people one research set concluded this the more time you spend on social media the more anxious you
[481.24 → 490.34] are the more depressed you are and the meaner you become it's pretty sad I read a quote once about a
[490.34 → 497.34] EU in the third one comment what is cancer cause didn't you know about a normal view for you right yes
[497.34 → 499.14] understand and all UNC печniejsze烈 things but something like that you never has to do isn't
[499.14 → 502.30] dead yet so you know my you may beивалiqui are or dead so some of my comfort кол leg and
[502.30 → 503.42] that's you know you haven't had Eastman up until 2020 and I think that it's Ahh you'll be
[503.42 → 508.50] uh were quite the outraged my teamwork with you over the next one and I looked at what
[508.50 → 511.76] Jesus Christ via said Michael good health point but really well it isn't useful on how
[511.76 → 515.16] does that if the jihad the re серьез Roland they've been living with us around now and
[515.16 → 516.80] yes we don't cook certain Denmark's how well it speaks to you in your life right shed
[516.80 → 524.10] we live in a culture of outrage everybody is mad at somebody about something
[524.10 → 531.12] and I'm not saying there aren't legitimate things to be angry about righteous anger about evil and
[531.12 → 538.54] injustice are certainly important but our righteous anger is so easily hijacked by our egos and by the
[538.54 → 544.84] devil himself and Jesus warns again and again about the dangers of anger I just picked one verse
[544.84 → 551.80] Matthew 5 22 out of the king jams verse where Jesus says but I say to you that whoever is angry with
[551.80 → 557.12] his brother or sister without a cause shall be in danger of judgment and whoever says to his brother
[557.12 → 563.00] aka which is the swear word in a way that shall be in danger of count of the council but whoever
[563.00 → 568.20] says you fool which doesn't sound like much shall be in danger of hellfire Jesus is really saying
[568.20 → 571.42] words matter more than you think
[571.42 → 581.34] Jesus saw there was a place for the right kind of anger which he himself displayed right we think of
[581.34 → 586.32] him turning over the money changer tables of the temple when he was upset by that display of
[586.32 → 597.18] greed in the temple but let's be honest a lot of our anger isn't that even if we pretend it is
[597.18 → 606.70] it's often rooted in selfishness and loaded with contempt for the other we look down on those who think
[606.70 → 615.90] differently those who don't think like we do, and then we elevate ourselves in our superior position
[615.90 → 625.48] Jesus brother jams said it this way in jams 1 he said my dear brothers and sisters take note of this
[625.48 → 631.58] everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry and I think those two
[631.58 → 636.86] probably belong together by being slow to speak you're probably less likely to be angry because
[636.86 → 644.00] human anger does not produce the righteousness that god desires therefore get rid of all moral
[644.00 → 650.90] filth whatever that is and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word god planted
[650.90 → 654.66] planted in you his words which can save you
[654.66 → 665.60] basically Jesus saying shift your position or jams shift your position from speaking in anger to listening
[665.60 → 672.90] and love which sounds nice, but it's hard to do where you don't have to spout off
[672.90 → 684.78] and in all honesty i too often spout off just ask my kids they're all adults and if a topic comes up I feel
[684.78 → 692.24] like I've got a lot to say and I do but I don't need to say it and too often it didn't go particularly
[692.24 → 698.10] well and I regret it later and I'm trying to learn that, and my wife is trying to teach me that
[698.10 → 703.16] they can't carbohydrate in you know what you can learn that matter and that's right I guess it's
[703.16 → 705.12] perfect if you say it goes forward there are millions that's right, and it's nothing that's
[705.12 → 708.44] just like I don't think that our people complete privilege can hire us from allegedly
[708.44 → 710.94] that the people that are learning to march because our people who don't have to think that
[710.94 → 713.08] is that for us whatever it is there you may have to think so many people will improve
[713.08 → 716.14] and we will come up here on the web page in your website, and it's the people that come down
[716.14 → 718.20] out here Filth is you What are there you know if we have trouble
[718.20 → 719.70] anyone else you need to know and go to the adulterer
[719.70 → 725.10] I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hate so stubbornly
[725.10 → 727.74] is because they sense once hate is gone,
[727.74 → 730.88] they will be forced to deal with pain.
[734.76 → 736.96] And none of us wants to deal with pain.
[738.12 → 743.00] Behind every rant on social media or road rage or outburst
[743.00 → 746.24] is a deep pain being suppressed.
[746.36 → 747.34] At least that's often true.
[747.34 → 749.66] Pain that often comes from fear.
[750.08 → 751.06] Fear of the future.
[751.28 → 752.10] Fear of the past.
[752.24 → 753.24] Fear of losing control.
[753.72 → 754.62] Fear of the other.
[754.72 → 756.44] Fear of what others think of us.
[756.68 → 761.12] Fear that if people actually knew us, they'd be deeply disappointed.
[763.26 → 765.88] And all we'd be left with is shame and rejection.
[768.50 → 770.02] Fear is designed by God.
[770.12 → 774.50] I think designed by God is where we'll see danger and harm where it can come from.
[774.50 → 778.88] But with sin, our fear instead of being a servant becomes our master.
[779.76 → 781.10] Can you relate to that?
[782.46 → 785.80] Has fear in some ways become your master instead of a servant?
[786.76 → 792.00] And then the fear sabotages our deepest desires and fills us with anxiety.
[792.00 → 796.26] I mean, how many people nowadays talk about anxiety?
[796.58 → 799.16] I think when I grew up, I don't think we ever used the word.
[803.34 → 805.10] And then we think things.
[805.14 → 806.20] And I've thought it too, right?
[806.22 → 808.30] Who can love me if they really knew me?
[810.50 → 813.42] 1 John 4.18 says this.
[813.42 → 817.96] There is no fear in love.
[821.12 → 824.50] Perfect love drives out fear.
[824.94 → 826.74] Because love has to do with punishment.
[827.78 → 831.08] The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
[831.14 → 833.02] In other words, you're a work in progress.
[834.30 → 835.84] You've got some thinking to do.
[835.84 → 837.92] You know, I look at my life.
[839.78 → 840.82] And I have to be honest.
[840.90 → 844.00] I see how much fear pushed me into some unhealthy living.
[844.90 → 848.80] Some of that came out of growing up with a dad who had profound anger issues.
[849.60 → 851.10] He was a loving guy in so many ways.
[851.18 → 853.18] But he had lots and lots of rage.
[855.76 → 856.44] And you learned.
[857.26 → 858.16] That became normal.
[858.30 → 860.46] And you learn to live with fear.
[860.70 → 861.84] And it shapes you.
[861.84 → 864.64] And so you say the right thing.
[864.78 → 867.02] Which means not the thing that was necessarily true.
[867.20 → 870.66] But the thing that might help control the angry person.
[871.86 → 875.44] And then you learn to become a people pleaser.
[877.12 → 877.52] Right?
[877.60 → 883.36] I've got to say the right thing to keep that person in a good space with me.
[884.32 → 886.00] Not necessarily the truth.
[886.00 → 892.88] There was some unhealthy living going on there for me.
[893.04 → 896.78] And with lots of counselling and the love of an amazing wife and family.
[897.30 → 901.56] I began to see how I was shaped and misshaped.
[902.98 → 906.14] And you learn to face the fear.
[906.50 → 908.82] You learn to face the pain.
[909.28 → 910.88] And it's an ongoing journey.
[911.02 → 913.16] You don't arrive completely.
[913.16 → 917.14] Because pain and fear become a part of you.
[917.36 → 920.18] They start running your life in unhealthy ways.
[920.62 → 923.90] And you escape in all kinds of unhealthy ways.
[924.42 → 926.92] Ways that aren't going to help you in the long run.
[927.92 → 931.56] And as long as my life was run by fear and anger and pain.
[931.80 → 935.76] I negated the full potential of God's love in me.
[935.76 → 939.24] God was flowing.
[939.38 → 941.02] Love was flowing through me.
[941.14 → 942.18] But I blocked it.
[942.56 → 945.70] And it caused harm to my family.
[946.02 → 946.98] To myself.
[947.18 → 947.96] And to others.
[948.44 → 950.34] Because it wasn't opening up to that love.
[953.26 → 954.28] The way of Jesus.
[954.38 → 955.14] We sang about it too.
[955.20 → 958.34] The way of Jesus offers so much more.
[959.24 → 960.00] So much more.
[960.54 → 961.82] Scripture says so often.
[961.90 → 962.30] Do not fear.
[962.30 → 962.58] In fact.
[963.48 → 966.48] Some writers say it's the most repeated command in scripture.
[966.74 → 967.26] Do not fear.
[967.34 → 967.70] Do not fear.
[967.78 → 968.12] Do not fear.
[968.22 → 968.56] Do not fear.
[968.76 → 970.02] I put two examples down.
[970.58 → 971.74] John 14.27.
[971.88 → 972.52] Jesus says.
[973.08 → 974.98] Peace I leave you.
[975.18 → 976.38] My peace I give you.
[976.62 → 978.86] I do not give you as the world gives.
[978.94 → 979.10] Right?
[979.16 → 980.44] Where there's that lie going on.
[980.72 → 982.36] Do not let your hearts be troubled.
[982.78 → 984.46] Do not be afraid.
[986.08 → 986.50] Peace.
[986.66 → 987.10] No fear.
[987.10 → 987.22] There.
[988.30 → 989.62] John 16.33.
[990.16 → 990.70] Jesus says.
[990.82 → 991.80] I have told you these things.
[991.90 → 993.28] So that in me, you may have peace.
[993.34 → 993.96] There we are again.
[994.62 → 996.58] In this world you will have trouble.
[998.56 → 1002.68] Somehow peace is not the absence of trouble.
[1003.24 → 1004.58] In this world you will have trouble.
[1004.70 → 1005.08] But take heart.
[1005.14 → 1005.96] I have overcome the world.
[1006.24 → 1008.18] We trust that Jesus has brought victory.
[1009.20 → 1010.38] Jesus brings us peace.
[1010.42 → 1012.04] As opposed to all the angst.
[1012.16 → 1014.04] And all the anxiety that we live in.
[1014.04 → 1017.88] And the church is supposed to be a community of peace.
[1018.00 → 1020.64] In a culture of fear and outrage.
[1021.46 → 1026.88] One writer described this peace as being a non-anxious presence.
[1027.96 → 1029.12] I like that.
[1030.06 → 1032.02] A non-anxious presence.
[1034.48 → 1037.32] Where we're not drawn into all the chaos.
[1037.96 → 1040.86] We're not pulled into all the surrounding unrest.
[1040.86 → 1043.62] Rather we are anchored in the presence of Jesus.
[1044.04 → 1044.48] How?
[1044.66 → 1050.46] How do we keep from getting sucked into that black hole of outrage and fear.
[1050.72 → 1052.28] That is so much around us.
[1052.60 → 1054.24] What can we do to stop that?
[1054.58 → 1056.50] And I think there's probably a lot we can do.
[1056.76 → 1058.80] But I'd like to hold up one practice.
[1058.94 → 1061.36] And that is the practice of silence.
[1062.84 → 1065.10] We already said listen more speak less.
[1065.32 → 1067.18] That's helpful in this journey.
[1067.18 → 1068.98] But I think it's more than that.
[1069.18 → 1070.28] And look at Luke 5.
[1070.34 → 1071.58] And we'll see what Jesus did here.
[1072.68 → 1073.50] Look at it with me.
[1073.60 → 1074.82] Luke 5 15 through 16.
[1074.94 → 1077.44] Yet the news about him spread all the more about Jesus.
[1077.86 → 1081.06] So crowds came to hear him and be healed of all their sickness.
[1081.54 → 1082.00] Now I want you.
[1082.16 → 1082.68] A pastor.
[1082.94 → 1083.64] As a pastor.
[1083.78 → 1084.46] I would note.
[1085.44 → 1088.26] He's having super successful ministry going on right there.
[1089.26 → 1090.46] Things are going perfect.
[1090.54 → 1091.50] Lots of crowds are coming.
[1091.50 → 1094.48] Now notice what he does at that moment.
[1095.54 → 1100.30] But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.
[1102.24 → 1110.16] He stepped away from doing good to receiving good.
[1112.32 → 1114.54] I'm not sure what that perfect balance is.
[1114.62 → 1115.36] But Jesus knew.
[1116.64 → 1119.98] He needed this foundational practice in his life.
[1119.98 → 1122.42] He needed silence and solitude.
[1122.84 → 1127.44] It was about creating a space to hear God the Father speak into his life.
[1127.60 → 1128.74] And so into ours.
[1129.10 → 1131.04] To reveal where we need healing.
[1131.42 → 1133.62] To repent where we've embraced lies.
[1134.00 → 1137.52] To commune with God about our deepest needs.
[1139.96 → 1142.58] Last week Pastor Dave spoke so well on rest.
[1143.12 → 1145.96] And this is part of the resting in the Lord.
[1145.96 → 1148.86] As opposed to keep running in your strength.
[1148.86 → 1150.74] Without ever finding that solitude.
[1150.74 → 1152.30] And facing what you need to face.
[1153.68 → 1155.72] This is often called a quiet time.
[1155.88 → 1157.18] It can be in your house.
[1157.22 → 1158.00] In your yard.
[1158.08 → 1159.88] It can be in your office.
[1159.94 → 1160.12] Wherever.
[1160.22 → 1162.82] It's a place that becomes part of your routines.
[1163.58 → 1164.80] Jesus said so beautifully.
[1165.36 → 1166.18] Abide in me.
[1166.30 → 1167.96] Abide comes the word abode.
[1168.04 → 1168.80] Which means home.
[1169.22 → 1170.86] Make your home in God.
[1170.86 → 1173.14] As he lives in you.
[1174.88 → 1179.58] One of my favourite verses is out of Psalm 23.
[1179.78 → 1180.88] Which is David's.
[1181.14 → 1182.32] The Lord is my shepherd.
[1182.90 → 1184.06] Famous passage.
[1184.52 → 1185.72] But I love this line.
[1186.90 → 1187.46] Where he writes.
[1187.64 → 1189.46] You prepare a table before me.
[1189.52 → 1189.86] Where?
[1190.36 → 1192.44] In the presence of my enemies.
[1192.50 → 1193.88] You anoint my head with oil.
[1193.98 → 1194.76] My cup overflows.
[1194.84 → 1195.46] You seek blessing.
[1195.46 → 1196.92] But notice where.
[1197.32 → 1199.10] In the presence of my enemies.
[1199.98 → 1201.22] There is God.
[1201.40 → 1203.38] In the midst of it all.
[1204.00 → 1205.60] We think peace comes.
[1205.86 → 1207.22] And the lack of fear comes.
[1207.40 → 1209.80] When everything's settled and right again.
[1210.08 → 1211.46] Then we'll have peace.
[1214.32 → 1214.90] And somehow.
[1215.16 → 1217.46] Peace is all about the presence of God.
[1217.54 → 1218.74] In the midst of it all.
[1220.60 → 1222.70] Robert Mulholland said it rather well.
[1223.74 → 1224.90] Look at this quote.
[1225.46 → 1228.16] Silence is bringing ourselves.
[1228.66 → 1229.30] To a point.
[1229.62 → 1231.54] Of relinquishing to God.
[1232.04 → 1233.80] Our control of our relationship.
[1234.44 → 1235.12] With God.
[1236.76 → 1238.04] Think about that.
[1238.78 → 1240.90] How much are we trying to control God?
[1242.44 → 1244.08] Silence is the reversal.
[1244.08 → 1245.64] Of the whole possessing.
[1245.74 → 1246.22] Controlling.
[1246.48 → 1247.42] Grasping dynamic.
[1247.76 → 1249.26] Of trying to maintain control.
[1249.26 → 1250.32] Of our own existence.
[1250.94 → 1252.66] Silence is the inner act.
[1252.66 → 1254.28] Of letting go.
[1255.46 → 1259.02] That is a radical posture.
[1259.66 → 1261.70] And it is so counter cultural.
[1262.04 → 1263.34] To a culture that says.
[1263.74 → 1264.66] You do you.
[1264.94 → 1266.02] You decide.
[1266.46 → 1267.42] You control.
[1267.80 → 1270.18] You can do anything you want to do.
[1270.18 → 1274.66] Hear me well.
[1275.66 → 1276.66] This silence.
[1276.82 → 1279.10] Isn't about taking a break.
[1279.76 → 1281.26] In your busy schedule.
[1281.52 → 1282.52] In that silence.
[1282.74 → 1285.12] This is about surrendering your will.
[1285.38 → 1286.78] So you can know.
[1287.16 → 1288.26] God's will.
[1289.34 → 1290.52] Instead of yours.
[1291.52 → 1291.96] Now.
[1292.64 → 1294.50] Go back to those desert fathers.
[1294.50 → 1296.26] Their.
[1296.26 → 1297.58] Their go-to text.
[1297.58 → 1299.00] Was probably not.
[1299.30 → 1300.12] Luke 5.
[1300.20 → 1300.82] The one I just read.
[1300.88 → 1302.12] Where Jesus went to a quiet place.
[1302.66 → 1303.62] Theirs was likely.
[1304.06 → 1304.86] Luke 4.
[1305.24 → 1306.26] One through two.
[1306.52 → 1307.98] What is that passage?
[1308.10 → 1308.80] Look at it with me.
[1310.18 → 1310.86] Luke 4.
[1311.34 → 1311.68] Jesus.
[1312.06 → 1313.32] Full of the Holy Spirit.
[1313.74 → 1314.44] Left the Jordan.
[1314.56 → 1315.52] Was led by the Spirit.
[1315.60 → 1316.22] Into the wilderness.
[1316.40 → 1316.76] There's that.
[1317.00 → 1317.68] That place.
[1317.68 → 1318.78] It's called in Greek.
[1318.92 → 1319.50] The Er emos.
[1320.72 → 1321.68] The wilderness.
[1321.92 → 1322.48] The desert.
[1323.10 → 1324.70] The lonely place.
[1324.98 → 1325.82] It is that place.
[1325.98 → 1326.74] Where we stop.
[1327.76 → 1328.48] And notice here.
[1328.54 → 1329.88] Jesus led into the wilderness.
[1330.04 → 1330.44] The Er emos.
[1330.80 → 1332.04] Where for 40 days.
[1332.28 → 1333.10] He was tempted.
[1333.56 → 1334.44] By the devil.
[1335.74 → 1336.10] What?
[1338.32 → 1340.10] We want the silence.
[1340.20 → 1341.74] In order to bask in God's peace.
[1341.80 → 1342.60] And that's wonderful.
[1342.70 → 1343.28] That's true.
[1343.52 → 1345.02] But notice who shows up.
[1345.04 → 1345.62] In the silence.
[1345.62 → 1345.78] Satan.
[1348.10 → 1348.54] Satan.
[1350.14 → 1351.22] In the silence.
[1351.38 → 1352.08] Satan showed up.
[1352.30 → 1353.16] In the silence.
[1353.16 → 1353.98] Our fears.
[1354.18 → 1354.92] Our anxieties.
[1355.18 → 1355.74] Show up.
[1356.42 → 1356.86] Saying.
[1357.02 → 1357.72] Maybe screaming.
[1357.86 → 1357.98] Yeah.
[1358.02 → 1358.86] But what about this?
[1358.92 → 1359.60] What about that?
[1359.66 → 1360.56] That was so unfair.
[1360.68 → 1362.08] I was so mistreated here.
[1362.28 → 1363.28] I deserve more.
[1363.60 → 1364.74] All kinds of things.
[1364.90 → 1365.12] Go.
[1365.26 → 1366.72] Happen in the silence.
[1368.72 → 1369.46] These thoughts.
[1369.62 → 1371.08] Try to dominate our minds.
[1371.18 → 1371.84] In the silence.
[1372.10 → 1373.02] And in that Er emos.
[1373.02 → 1373.96] In that place.
[1374.14 → 1374.94] Of encounter.
[1374.94 → 1376.26] We encounter God.
[1376.58 → 1376.86] But yet.
[1376.98 → 1377.96] We also encounter.
[1378.06 → 1378.72] The brokenness.
[1378.78 → 1379.30] And the pain.
[1379.56 → 1380.16] And the devil.
[1380.94 → 1382.82] With the realities of life.
[1383.20 → 1385.76] And who you actually are.
[1392.30 → 1393.34] Henry Owen.
[1394.78 → 1395.64] Said this.
[1395.74 → 1396.70] And I love this quote.
[1398.56 → 1399.26] He said.
[1399.26 → 1399.90] Solitude.
[1399.90 → 1400.10] Solitude.
[1400.10 → 1400.14] Solitude.
[1400.14 → 1400.18] Solitude.
[1400.18 → 1400.26] Solitude.
[1400.26 → 1401.14] Solitude.
[1401.14 → 1402.78] Is not a private.
[1402.78 → 1404.44] Therapeutic place.
[1406.38 → 1407.22] But rather.
[1407.38 → 1408.76] It is a place of conversion.
[1409.44 → 1411.40] The place where the old self.
[1411.68 → 1412.22] Dies.
[1412.86 → 1413.40] And I would say.
[1413.48 → 1414.36] Dies again.
[1414.50 → 1414.98] And again.
[1415.18 → 1415.58] And again.
[1415.74 → 1416.06] And again.
[1416.30 → 1417.46] And the new self.
[1417.60 → 1418.12] Is born.
[1418.46 → 1418.84] Again.
[1418.98 → 1419.40] And again.
[1419.56 → 1419.96] And again.
[1420.10 → 1420.48] And again.
[1420.90 → 1421.42] Solitude.
[1421.70 → 1422.58] Is the furnace.
[1422.58 → 1423.50] Of transformation.
[1424.14 → 1425.14] Without solitude.
[1425.14 → 1426.74] We remain the victims.
[1426.74 → 1427.70] Of our society.
[1428.06 → 1429.56] And continue to be entangled.
[1429.80 → 1430.80] In the illusion.
[1431.22 → 1432.54] Of the false selves.
[1432.62 → 1434.54] And we all have some false selves.
[1434.94 → 1436.14] It is the encounter.
[1436.42 → 1437.72] With the loving God.
[1437.88 → 1439.28] Who offers himself.
[1439.48 → 1440.64] To be the substance.
[1440.64 → 1442.22] Of the new self.
[1443.00 → 1444.14] And is the Lord.
[1444.26 → 1445.08] The substance.
[1445.38 → 1446.16] Of you.
[1450.60 → 1451.36] It's then.
[1451.46 → 1452.14] That we are freed.
[1452.26 → 1453.10] From the attachments.
[1453.10 → 1454.38] Of what we think.
[1454.58 → 1455.10] We need.
[1455.42 → 1456.54] Things that fuel.
[1456.74 → 1457.42] Our anger.
[1457.60 → 1458.08] And our hate.
[1458.18 → 1458.80] And our pain.
[1458.88 → 1459.46] And our fears.
[1459.84 → 1461.30] Freed to be transformed.
[1461.46 → 1462.30] As now one says.
[1462.54 → 1463.30] In a furnace.
[1463.30 → 1464.38] Of transformation.
[1464.76 → 1466.28] On God's terms.
[1469.36 → 1470.20] John Mark Career.
[1470.26 → 1470.70] Said it this way.
[1470.74 → 1470.90] He said.
[1470.94 → 1472.04] The path of transformation.
[1472.56 → 1473.56] Is learning to be.
[1473.80 → 1474.86] With our pain.
[1475.10 → 1475.82] And our anger.
[1475.82 → 1476.62] And our deepest fears.
[1476.94 → 1477.70] And let God be.
[1477.96 → 1478.20] With us.
[1478.26 → 1478.72] And all that.
[1479.00 → 1479.92] So that new life.
[1480.08 → 1480.44] Can emerge.
[1480.58 → 1482.02] In and through us.
[1482.02 → 1486.56] We meet God.
[1486.56 → 1487.60] In it all.
[1488.18 → 1489.44] He prepares a table.
[1489.44 → 1489.84] For us.
[1490.06 → 1491.34] Even with all our pain.
[1491.42 → 1491.94] And enemies.
[1492.06 → 1492.74] All around us.
[1492.90 → 1494.20] He feeds us.
[1494.20 → 1495.26] In those places.
[1495.26 → 1497.16] But you have to go.
[1497.16 → 1498.30] To that place.
[1500.72 → 1502.54] You can't keep running around.
[1502.54 → 1503.68] With all the distractions.
[1504.42 → 1505.74] Thinking you'll grow that way.
[1505.80 → 1506.32] You won't.
[1506.90 → 1508.42] There new life emerges.
[1508.86 → 1510.08] There we can become.
[1510.14 → 1511.34] A non-anxious presence.
[1511.54 → 1512.30] In a culture.
[1512.66 → 1513.62] Of outrage.
[1513.62 → 1515.14] And fear.
[1515.90 → 1517.02] And then we can offer.
[1517.16 → 1517.84] The gift of peace.
[1517.90 → 1518.54] To our families.
[1518.64 → 1519.70] And to the world around us.
[1519.92 → 1521.38] So let me encourage you.
[1522.24 → 1523.36] When you wake up.
[1523.40 → 1523.86] In the morning.
[1525.72 → 1526.12] Before.
[1526.92 → 1527.40] You touch.
[1527.66 → 1528.18] Your phone.
[1533.36 → 1534.06] I had to.
[1534.20 → 1535.28] Kind of translate that.
[1535.36 → 1535.86] For myself.
[1536.60 → 1537.60] I don't touch my phone.
[1537.68 → 1538.16] Too fast.
[1539.02 → 1539.74] First thing I do.
[1539.78 → 1540.32] When I wake up.
[1540.36 → 1541.42] Is I pop on the news.
[1541.42 → 1544.34] And I wonder why I feel anxious all day.
[1545.70 → 1546.10] Right.
[1546.16 → 1546.34] You know.
[1546.46 → 1547.92] It's just not a good way to start.
[1548.02 → 1549.18] So before you touch your phone.
[1549.24 → 1550.28] Or touch the TV.
[1550.42 → 1551.12] And listen to the news.
[1551.14 → 1551.42] Or whatever.
[1551.86 → 1552.86] Start with prayer.
[1553.08 → 1555.10] However long that might be.
[1555.50 → 1555.80] And then.
[1555.90 → 1557.74] And then you'll start on the right foot.
[1557.92 → 1559.30] And then try to relax.
[1559.30 → 1560.88] In the goodness of God.
[1561.26 → 1562.74] Start with the calm.
[1562.90 → 1564.46] Calm presence of God.
[1564.64 → 1565.06] In your life.
[1565.40 → 1566.02] Read a scripture.
[1566.18 → 1566.84] Maybe a psalm.
[1567.28 → 1568.72] Sense God's presence.
[1568.86 → 1569.56] The God who said.
[1569.90 → 1570.98] I am with you always.
[1570.98 → 1571.84] My peace.
[1571.96 → 1573.16] I give to you.
[1574.80 → 1576.24] Be aware of all.
[1576.64 → 1577.22] That you are.
[1578.08 → 1578.36] Yeah.
[1578.50 → 1579.30] You don't have to pretend.
[1580.16 → 1581.32] Be aware of all.
[1581.50 → 1582.10] That you are.
[1582.90 → 1583.78] And know that.
[1583.94 → 1584.68] And release that.
[1584.76 → 1585.48] To God's grace.
[1586.68 → 1588.06] Peter Cicero said it this way.
[1588.10 → 1588.22] He said.
[1588.26 → 1589.64] Our core spiritual problem.
[1589.98 → 1590.94] Is self will.
[1591.16 → 1592.04] We all want to be.
[1592.26 → 1594.00] We all want a spiritual life.
[1594.34 → 1596.00] But we prefer to be in charge.
[1596.08 → 1596.80] Of that life.
[1597.40 → 1598.64] And have it unfold.
[1598.64 → 1600.12] According to our schedule.
[1600.66 → 1601.80] In our way.
[1603.70 → 1606.44] Surrender is an ongoing journey.
[1607.78 → 1610.06] This is the heart of prayer.
[1610.62 → 1611.50] And solitude.
[1611.94 → 1612.86] And rest.
[1612.86 → 1615.02] I read this quote.
[1615.12 → 1616.52] From a Singaporean author.
[1617.24 → 1618.18] And writer named.
[1619.12 → 1620.18] Wee Tan.
[1620.92 → 1621.82] And he said this.
[1621.86 → 1622.14] He said.
[1622.24 → 1624.16] You become what you contemplate.
[1625.76 → 1628.50] You become what you contemplate.
[1628.50 → 1630.50] Let me ask you this.
[1630.58 → 1631.46] What do you want to become?
[1632.64 → 1634.60] Have you ever put some intentionality to that?
[1635.28 → 1636.50] Not just career wise.
[1636.58 → 1638.06] What do you want to become as a human being?
[1639.32 → 1641.14] And then ask yourself.
[1641.14 → 1643.14] What do I contemplate?
[1644.08 → 1646.66] Where is my focus most of the time?
[1646.94 → 1649.14] Because that will be what's shaping you.
[1649.14 → 1657.90] As we contemplate Christ.
[1658.84 → 1661.56] Looking at him in the solitude that we've created.
[1661.56 → 1662.60] And in prayer.
[1662.82 → 1663.36] And in scripture.
[1663.82 → 1664.78] Over time.
[1664.88 → 1666.10] Through the work of the Holy Spirit.
[1666.30 → 1670.76] We'll become more and more and more like Christ.
[1670.92 → 1672.90] Because we're contemplating.
[1673.14 → 1675.06] We're focusing on him.
[1675.06 → 1679.94] Let God transform you into his likeness.
[1681.34 → 1683.18] Because then you can love like him.
[1683.48 → 1684.64] As we started in John.
[1685.14 → 1686.16] We're to love like him.
[1686.20 → 1686.82] How do we do that?
[1686.94 → 1687.90] By focusing on him.
[1687.94 → 1688.70] By looking at him.
[1688.86 → 1690.72] By allowing the spirit to transform us.
[1691.18 → 1691.86] And then.
[1692.28 → 1694.22] Then in this world of outrage.
[1694.32 → 1695.30] In this world of fear.
[1695.66 → 1698.30] We can show a better way.
[1700.06 → 1700.78] Let's pray.
[1705.06 → 1705.80] Father God.
[1705.92 → 1707.22] We thank you so much.
[1707.42 → 1711.00] For inviting us.
[1711.10 → 1712.56] Into those quiet places.
[1713.70 → 1714.70] Into the Ramos.
[1715.02 → 1715.62] Into the wilderness.
[1715.82 → 1716.38] Into the desert.
[1716.38 → 1716.64] Lord.
[1716.80 → 1717.90] You invite us.
[1718.16 → 1719.60] To bring our whole selves.
[1719.78 → 1720.54] Into your presence.
[1721.88 → 1723.36] You feed us.
[1723.62 → 1725.34] You feed us from that table.
[1725.50 → 1727.22] That is in the presence of all our enemies.
[1727.28 → 1727.94] All the brokenness.
[1727.98 → 1728.90] Everything that's going on.
[1729.26 → 1730.94] And you feed us in those places.
[1732.20 → 1732.64] Oh Lord.
[1732.72 → 1734.18] May we surrender to you.
[1734.18 → 1736.48] May we learn what it means to surrender.
[1736.80 → 1738.34] May we contemplate you.
[1738.44 → 1739.94] So we can be like you.
[1741.56 → 1743.74] So that we can love like you.
[1745.36 → 1746.64] Because that's what we need.
[1747.44 → 1748.74] And that's what this world needs.
[1748.98 → 1749.58] In Jesus name.
[1749.88 → 1750.08] Amen.
[1753.52 → 1755.10] Please stand and join us.
