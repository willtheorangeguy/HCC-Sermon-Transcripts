[2052.70 → 2082.70] Thank you.
[2082.70 → 2112.70] Thank you.
[2112.70 → 2142.70] Thank you.
[2142.70 → 2172.68] Thank you.
[2172.70 → 2202.70] Thank you.
[2202.70 → 2232.70] Thank you.
[2232.70 → 2262.70] And so,
[2262.70 → 2263.70] I can see you.
[2292.70 → 2293.70] I want to see you.
[2322.70 → 2327.88] bit, you know, we definitely eat a bit on the cost, but we want to care for not only
[2327.88 → 2332.86] just our own employees, but just everyone else in the world as best as we can. And so,
[2332.86 → 2338.02] yeah, and that's been to a lot of help of companies out east, that they've been kind
[2338.02 → 2342.66] of already been doing this long before we have. And so they definitely helped us out
[2342.66 → 2348.56] finding the right companies. And the US has also been really clamping down on companies
[2348.56 → 2352.68] that don't treat their employees very well. And so that's been a huge help for us. Otherwise,
[2353.30 → 2357.06] to do with just me and my friend, we would have had to travel all around overseas and
[2357.06 → 2361.12] try to figure this out. And so I'm really grateful that there are other companies out
[2361.12 → 2365.88] there that are also doing the same as us. I just want to name how much I appreciate
[2365.88 → 2370.02] that last point. Like, it might be for many of us a self-evident point that you want to
[2370.02 → 2374.48] have the character of Christ. You want to speak well around your employees. You want to treat
[2374.48 → 2380.06] them well. But the work itself, that your discipleship is shaping not only wanting to
[2380.06 → 2383.74] make a quality product, but like the things that go into it behind the scenes that nobody
[2383.74 → 2387.90] sees, you want to make sure that also honours Jesus. And I'm just very encouraged by that
[2387.90 → 2391.96] because that's often a piece that you don't hear a lot about and people don't want to talk
[2391.96 → 2396.50] about because it takes a sacrifice on the cost. So I'm just very encouraged by that.
[2396.50 → 2400.76] How can we pray for you in the place where God sends you?
[2400.76 → 2410.26] Oh man. Well, because we are a small company, like I said, we all wear a lot of hats in the
[2410.26 → 2415.60] company of what we do. And so it definitely can be stressful. A lot of time, even when you're at
[2415.60 → 2420.60] home, and you might be watching the Canucks win the playoffs, you're still churning in your head.
[2421.40 → 2428.10] And so it's definitely a big thing is just I need prayer for just keeping my relationship with God.
[2428.10 → 2434.44] I wake up earlier than I need to so I can have my time in the mornings to spend with God, whether
[2434.44 → 2439.60] it's devotions, prayers, and so that I can just keep doing that, even though I feel very tired some
[2439.60 → 2445.68] mornings, that I can just keep doing that and holding fast to Him. And even just with relationships
[2445.68 → 2453.42] with friends, family, my wife, just as things get busy that I can just really emphasize spending
[2453.42 → 2461.32] time with people who matter to me. And so yeah, definitely prayer for that. Another one is as we
[2461.32 → 2467.24] grow, I won't be on the shop floor as much. So another thing I'm very scared about is just that
[2467.24 → 2474.80] I hope I can implement an environment that our work has that is honouring to God. And maybe if I'm not on
[2474.80 → 2480.02] the floor as much, I really hope that it stays that way. And so I just pray that God puts the right
[2480.02 → 2486.72] people in places that can keep this environment that we love and honour God through our work and
[2486.72 → 2491.32] just that that can stay there, even if I'm not there five days a week. But just it's something
[2491.32 → 2498.44] that I find is really needed in a lot of workplaces. And I want that to, you know, happen at mine.
[2500.44 → 2504.16] Well, Peter, you're right where you need to be. And it'd be a privilege to pray for you. So would you
[2504.16 → 2510.46] join me in praying for Peter and his work? Father, we thank you for the gift of our work.
[2511.20 → 2516.48] Thank you for all the different gifts in this church, all the places we go tomorrow morning to
[2516.48 → 2521.72] serve you. And I want to pray specifically now for Peter. I pray that he would remember that he is more
[2521.72 → 2527.38] than his work, that he is a husband, a brother, a child, a friend, and that he would nurture his
[2527.38 → 2532.22] relationship with you and his family and his friends. And out of that health would come a healthy
[2532.22 → 2539.02] worker and a leader in his workplace. Would you bless the work of his hands? Would you bless his
[2539.02 → 2545.10] leadership on the shop floor? And would the source and the work they make and the work they produce
[2545.10 → 2549.92] bring blessing to many people who buy these solar panels? Would your kingdom come and your will be
[2549.92 → 2556.84] done in his workplace? We ask in Christ's name. Amen. Thank you so much, Peter. It's a gift that you share.
[2556.84 → 2557.00] Thank you.
[2562.22 → 2583.40] Thank you very much for sharing, Peter. We come together as a community, a community of diverse
[2583.40 → 2590.84] backgrounds, different personalities, and different gifts, and different experiences. And as a community,
[2591.32 → 2598.60] we're united in one common belief, that God sent his only son so that those that believe in him may
[2598.60 → 2604.52] have everlasting life. As a community, it's my privilege to lead us in community prayer. Would
[2604.52 → 2608.68] you please bow your heads with me as we lift the needs of our community to our Lord Jesus?
[2615.00 → 2623.80] Our Father in heaven, creator of heaven and earth, we come together to give you our praise and to worship you.
[2623.80 → 2632.36] In the name of Jesus, we ask that your Holy Spirit flow in this place and in our homes.
[2634.60 → 2641.72] What a wonderful sunny week that we have enjoyed this past week. We got to see the surrounding mountains,
[2641.72 → 2649.48] and we watched the surrounding trees come to life. And just as it has happened for thousands of years,
[2649.48 → 2656.84] years, the flowers have come up from the earth and returned to bloom. We give thanks for all of your
[2656.84 → 2666.36] creation. And we consider how wonderfully and marvellously it is all made. We praise you, our mighty God.
[2668.92 → 2677.64] Lord God, we pray and lift the many needs in our community around us. We pray for the many social
[2677.64 → 2685.48] injustices that occur each day. We pray for all those that suffer from abuse at the hands of others.
[2687.72 → 2691.24] Lord Jesus, come and save our world from such sadness.
[2693.96 → 2699.32] Lord, we lift and pray for those among us who are facing difficulties at home and at work.
[2701.00 → 2706.28] We lift and ask that you be with those who may be facing difficult decisions this coming week.
[2707.64 → 2708.92] Lord Jesus, come and pray for those who may be facing difficult decisions this coming week.
[2708.92 → 2715.64] For those among us who struggle with employment or with finances, we pray for strength and for determination.
[2718.20 → 2723.24] For those who are lonely, we pray for friendship and for community.
[2725.24 → 2731.24] For those who are struggling with addiction, we pray for self-control and for encouragement.
[2731.24 → 2739.56] For those who are struggling with health challenges.
[2742.36 → 2747.16] We pray for Mikey Thomas and his family as they experience the loss of his brother.
[2749.16 → 2754.44] We pray for healing for Margaret Floorer, who is still undergoing treatment at the hospital.
[2754.44 → 2762.76] And we also lift Tyler Dealer, and we continue to pray for your healing upon this young man.
[2765.00 → 2769.16] Lord God, there are many who are suffering with health issues in silence.
[2770.04 → 2774.52] And we pray for their pain to go away and for their bodies to be restored.
[2774.52 → 2782.94] Use us all here, Lord God, to go out and to love our community.
[2783.64 → 2785.12] To be kind.
[2785.72 → 2786.78] To care.
[2787.42 → 2788.60] To serve.
[2789.80 → 2793.40] With all the excitement around Clayton Heights Days coming up,
[2794.00 → 2797.60] please bless our efforts as we make your presence known here.
[2797.60 → 2800.14] May your will be done.
[2800.98 → 2806.66] And may that be evident through all the decisions and the plans as we prepare for this great event.
[2808.56 → 2812.96] Help each of us to continually find ways to serve in love.
[2814.08 → 2818.88] Both in our community here and wherever we live our daily lives.
[2821.52 → 2826.90] Lord God, prepare our hearts and our ears as we are about to hear your message today.
[2827.60 → 2833.24] We ask for your blessings upon Pastor Dave as he continues to teach your word to us.
[2834.10 → 2842.70] We ask all of these things in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and in the name of the Holy Spirit.
[2843.44 → 2843.74] Amen.
[2848.62 → 2852.86] After the prayer, I'm going to be sitting in the front here.
[2852.86 → 2858.58] And if there are any of you here that are perhaps moved by the message today,
[2859.12 → 2863.08] or if you're going through something in life that you would just like to lay at Jesus' feet,
[2863.60 → 2865.18] I'm going to be there for you.
[2865.34 → 2866.64] I'll be there after the service.
[2867.28 → 2871.18] And if nobody comes, I'm just going to sit there and pray for you all for this coming week,
[2871.24 → 2871.96] that you'll be blessed.
[2871.96 → 2872.96] Thank you.
[2872.96 → 2886.52] Well, good morning, everyone.
[2888.30 → 2892.02] I thought it would be helpful just to give us a sense of where we're going from here.
[2892.10 → 2895.14] We just finished a four-week sermon series on forgiveness.
[2896.14 → 2900.84] And we actually did a podcast this week, which is sort of a pastoral postscript on that.
[2900.92 → 2901.94] It's on anger and forgiveness.
[2902.10 → 2903.42] We felt like there was a little more to do there.
[2903.50 → 2905.52] So if you want to listen to that, you can.
[2906.70 → 2908.88] But on May the 19th, which is in two weeks,
[2908.90 → 2912.38] we are starting a new sermon series on the person and work of the Holy Spirit.
[2912.46 → 2914.10] That's been something people have asked us to preach on.
[2914.10 → 2916.76] So we're going to do a number of teachings on that,
[2916.84 → 2919.02] as well as we will have a spiritual gift seminar.
[2919.30 → 2923.62] And we're doing a multi-church worship gathering here on the 26th of May.
[2923.72 → 2926.78] So there's a lot happening around the Holy Spirit the next few weeks.
[2926.80 → 2929.26] But we have two weeks between now and then.
[2929.96 → 2934.36] And next week, Pastor Jonathan will be preaching on the ascension of Jesus and what that means.
[2934.82 → 2938.66] And this week, I decided to preach on something that I've wanted to preach on for a while.
[2938.66 → 2940.64] And a youth once asked me about.
[2940.64 → 2946.46] And that is, what did Jesus do between his resurrection and his ascension?
[2947.00 → 2951.02] So we're going to look at that 40-day period between Jesus' resurrection and ascension.
[2951.14 → 2955.18] And if you have your Bible, digital or physical, turn with me to Acts chapter 1.
[2955.24 → 2957.22] We're going to read the first nine verses together.
[2959.20 → 2960.78] This is Acts chapter 1.
[2962.62 → 2968.54] In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach
[2968.54 → 2970.88] until the day he was taken up into heaven,
[2971.34 → 2975.00] after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
[2976.16 → 2981.72] After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive.
[2982.58 → 2986.58] He appeared to them over the period of 40 days and spoke about the kingdom of God.
[2987.18 → 2990.22] On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command.
[2990.90 → 2994.76] Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my father promised,
[2994.76 → 2996.42] which you have heard me speak about.
[2997.04 → 3001.90] For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[3002.74 → 3004.38] So when they met together, they asked him,
[3004.52 → 3008.20] Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?
[3009.04 → 3009.88] He said to them,
[3009.90 → 3014.12] It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority,
[3014.70 → 3018.24] but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you,
[3018.44 → 3020.82] and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,
[3020.82 → 3024.80] in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
[3025.74 → 3028.52] After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes,
[3028.60 → 3030.46] and a cloud hid him from their sight.
[3034.48 → 3036.82] Over the last number of years, I've had the privilege,
[3037.20 → 3040.52] and I do mean privilege, of sitting down with people who did not grow up Christian,
[3041.18 → 3042.80] have very little understanding of the Bible,
[3042.92 → 3047.16] but are genuinely curious about Christianity and Jesus.
[3047.16 → 3052.52] Like genuinely wondering, what is the deal with following Jesus?
[3053.46 → 3056.38] And I love sitting down with people, or going for walks with people,
[3056.42 → 3057.34] and having these conversations,
[3057.50 → 3059.66] because you finally talk about more than the weather.
[3060.70 → 3061.90] Vancouver, that's all we talk about.
[3061.98 → 3064.02] You get into the deep stuff of life,
[3064.06 → 3068.54] and there's like the 30 to 50 why questions that anyone will have about the Bible,
[3068.68 → 3070.50] about Jesus, his resurrection.
[3070.80 → 3071.92] All of it is on the table.
[3073.04 → 3074.60] And I don't know if this will encourage you or not,
[3074.60 → 3077.02] but you should know that even me, and I've studied a fair bit about the Bible,
[3077.34 → 3080.26] I still have it so often in these conversations where I say,
[3080.74 → 3082.42] I don't know.
[3083.38 → 3085.54] I don't know why this suffering happens.
[3085.62 → 3089.24] I don't know exactly why this person has so much hardship in their life,
[3089.36 → 3091.70] but I want to talk about that through the lens of faith.
[3093.08 → 3095.50] And what I've learned about myself, and I bet you can relate to that,
[3095.52 → 3098.50] when you have these conversations with someone who's just genuinely curious,
[3099.08 → 3100.40] is you don't just want to give information.
[3101.16 → 3103.24] You don't just want to give them a few facts about Jesus.
[3103.24 → 3105.70] You want them to follow Jesus.
[3106.34 → 3109.94] And I find myself just saying, like, I want you to know why I'm a Christian.
[3110.02 → 3112.08] I want you to know why the church gathers.
[3112.18 → 3115.12] I want you to know why we worship, because Jesus is alive,
[3115.48 → 3120.30] and in him is salvation and life and abundance.
[3120.40 → 3122.20] I want you to have that.
[3123.16 → 3126.00] And if you've ever had that in a conversation with a friend or a co-worker
[3126.00 → 3129.96] or a family member, you can actually understand a little bit
[3129.96 → 3132.84] about what Luke is experiencing as he writes this book.
[3133.64 → 3138.82] The book of Acts is a book written to a guy named Theophilus,
[3139.20 → 3141.12] which is a very unpopular name nowadays.
[3141.26 → 3142.46] I don't know if it's ever going to come back.
[3142.82 → 3145.74] But this guy named Theophilus, we know very little about him.
[3145.98 → 3147.42] He's Greek based on his name.
[3147.84 → 3151.98] He's likely wealthy, given that he is named as the most excellent Theophilus
[3151.98 → 3152.74] in the book of Luke.
[3152.74 → 3159.16] And he was so curious about Jesus, his life, his death, his resurrection,
[3159.34 → 3165.24] that Luke wrote not just one but two whole books about Jesus just for him
[3165.24 → 3169.50] so that he could understand and grapple with this person of Jesus
[3169.50 → 3170.80] and the claims Jesus makes.
[3171.14 → 3175.48] And Luke's intention, to be clear, is not just giving historical information.
[3176.66 → 3179.58] Luke is not just interested in giving some details about Jesus.
[3179.58 → 3182.50] He's inviting Theophilus to faith.
[3183.82 → 3186.34] And I think it's worth just marvelling at the fact that
[3186.34 → 3190.70] we have two books in the Bible because a guy named Theophilus was curious,
[3191.36 → 3192.70] because he had his questions.
[3193.34 → 3195.04] And Luke's like, I'm going to tell you about it.
[3195.04 → 3195.78] And there's a chance.
[3195.88 → 3199.24] It's not known or proven, but there's a chance that Theophilus was so curious
[3199.24 → 3203.04] that he actually funded the writing of the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts.
[3204.30 → 3208.22] Now, Luke, the Gospel of Luke is all about what Jesus began to do and teach
[3208.22 → 3211.12] in his ministry, and it finishes with his resurrection.
[3211.40 → 3216.98] And then Luke says, Acts is all that Jesus continues to do and teach
[3216.98 → 3220.32] through the church by the power of the Spirit.
[3220.98 → 3221.76] I think that's really important.
[3221.86 → 3223.16] Jesus doesn't stop his ministry.
[3223.52 → 3226.94] He just transfers his ministry over to the church by the power of the Spirit,
[3227.06 → 3229.04] which we're going to get to in two weeks' time.
[3229.96 → 3235.32] But in this passage, in Acts chapter 1, Luke touches on that little section of time
[3235.32 → 3242.30] between Jesus' resurrection and ascension, that 40-day period where in his body he was
[3242.30 → 3243.12] with people.
[3243.78 → 3248.52] And I don't know about you, but I secretly wish a little more was written about this
[3248.52 → 3249.16] period of time.
[3249.58 → 3249.98] Don't you?
[3250.72 → 3255.32] He was in his body with disciples and in the city of his time with his resurrected body.
[3255.42 → 3257.24] I just feel like, what was that like?
[3257.32 → 3258.38] What did he say?
[3258.48 → 3259.32] What did he do?
[3260.08 → 3261.70] Luke gives us one verse.
[3262.58 → 3263.38] One verse.
[3263.38 → 3264.80] Now, the Gospels have more.
[3264.88 → 3265.58] We're going to get into that.
[3265.64 → 3270.42] But I want to read for us the verse that Luke gives us in Acts chapter 1, verse 3.
[3270.58 → 3271.36] This is what he says.
[3272.78 → 3277.58] After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that
[3277.58 → 3279.34] he was alive.
[3280.14 → 3284.38] He appeared to them over a period of 40 days and spoke about the kingdom of God.
[3285.44 → 3290.02] What Luke wants Theophilus to know, as he asks his question about Jesus, is that in the
[3290.02 → 3294.18] time between his resurrection and ascension, Jesus did predominantly two things.
[3294.72 → 3299.64] He showed people and gave proofs that he was alive, and he spoke about the kingdom of
[3299.64 → 3299.84] God.
[3299.90 → 3302.60] And we're going to see today how they're very intricately interconnected.
[3303.40 → 3305.14] So let's take a look at these two things.
[3305.22 → 3308.36] The first thing Jesus did was prove that he was alive.
[3308.44 → 3310.98] And I don't know about you, but I find myself chuckling a little bit.
[3310.98 → 3313.00] It's like, what did that look like for Jesus?
[3313.18 → 3314.62] Like, he's in his body.
[3314.96 → 3315.70] What's the proof?
[3315.80 → 3319.30] Like, ta-da, here I am, in my body, alive.
[3320.06 → 3325.20] And it's very important to underscore that even Jesus needed to do this because it was
[3325.20 → 3328.12] so hard to believe.
[3329.08 → 3334.50] Like, Jesus' disciples did not expect this to happen, so much so that he kept appearing.
[3335.30 → 3339.52] And if you read the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, well, John as well, you'll find that
[3339.52 → 3345.28] most of their attention to Jesus' post-resurrection time with his disciples is just showing up,
[3345.70 → 3348.16] appearing and appearing and appearing so that they believe.
[3348.52 → 3352.12] First, the women at the tomb who thought he was a gardener, then the disciples who were
[3352.12 → 3356.62] locked in a room for fear of their life, then Peter on the shore who is dejected for his
[3356.62 → 3358.90] abandonment of Jesus, and then he has a meal with him.
[3358.90 → 3364.34] But Jesus is constantly appearing to them to convince them that the very person they spent
[3364.34 → 3369.64] three straight years has risen from the dead and is actually alive in their very midst.
[3371.20 → 3372.78] And this is important.
[3373.34 → 3375.18] There are two things I want to say about this in specific.
[3375.40 → 3379.38] One is, Jesus told them that he was going to do this.
[3380.04 → 3384.04] In fact, in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Synoptic Gospels, he predicts his death and
[3384.04 → 3385.62] resurrection three times.
[3385.62 → 3390.12] It's probably more, but they made sure to use the word three as Jesus pretty.
[3390.22 → 3393.96] He said, I'm going to get arrested, I'm going to be crucified, and I'm going to rise on the
[3393.96 → 3394.24] third day.
[3394.30 → 3395.24] He told them this.
[3395.80 → 3401.48] And yet, when this actually happened, not a single person, not Mary, not Peter, not James,
[3401.74 → 3403.64] said to him, I knew it.
[3404.32 → 3406.12] I knew you were going to rise from the dead.
[3406.20 → 3406.96] They were stunned.
[3407.58 → 3408.48] They were afraid.
[3408.98 → 3414.00] Thomas needed a second appearance where he could touch Jesus' wound because that's how much
[3414.00 → 3417.46] doubt and disbelief existed in his own disciples.
[3418.52 → 3419.56] That's pretty profound.
[3421.00 → 3426.50] Now, it's really important to highlight that even among Jewish people, they believed in
[3426.50 → 3428.00] resurrection at the final day.
[3428.10 → 3432.04] So they believed when God returned in glory and power on that final day, that bodies would
[3432.04 → 3432.38] rise.
[3432.38 → 3439.24] But even Jewish people, when they saw Jesus, struggled to believe because it felt so implausible,
[3439.40 → 3444.84] so unbelievable that a body would rise back to life in the middle of history, not at the
[3444.84 → 3445.16] end.
[3445.80 → 3447.96] And Jesus broke their paradigms.
[3448.20 → 3450.54] He broke what was possible in their imaginations.
[3450.82 → 3456.16] And he wanted to teach them not only that he is alive, but then what it means that he's
[3456.16 → 3456.58] alive.
[3456.58 → 3464.18] Now, there are also two things that were circling around, and the dates are not exactly known,
[3464.28 → 3468.58] but there were, first, concerns about whether this was true right after Jesus
[3468.58 → 3469.90] was risen from the dead.
[3470.24 → 3476.12] There were people who claimed that Jesus' disciples hid his body right after his death, that the
[3476.12 → 3479.40] disciples went to the tomb, they took the body out, and they hid it as a way of protecting
[3479.40 → 3482.98] themselves from the shame of following this guy who was crucified.
[3482.98 → 3487.18] But one of the other things that was circulating, and this is new to me, is that there were
[3487.18 → 3491.86] people who said, okay, the disciples saw Jesus, but they saw sort of a spirit of Jesus.
[3492.04 → 3497.76] They saw a vision of Jesus that wasn't actually a body, it's just they had a vision, like that
[3497.76 → 3498.58] was a common thing.
[3498.92 → 3503.48] And that's why the story of Jesus and Peter on the beach really matters, because what does
[3503.48 → 3504.84] Jesus do with Peter on the beach?
[3505.52 → 3507.14] He sits down with them, and what does he do?
[3508.20 → 3508.96] He eats.
[3509.52 → 3511.68] It's his way of saying, look, this is a real body.
[3511.80 → 3512.78] I'm having a real meal.
[3512.78 → 3513.84] This body gets hungry.
[3513.96 → 3514.90] I want to dine with you.
[3515.24 → 3520.94] I'm truly alive as a resurrected Lord, as a resurrected body.
[3523.54 → 3528.84] Now, it's important also to note, and this is really significant for me, that there's
[3528.84 → 3530.40] many witnesses to Jesus' resurrection.
[3530.60 → 3533.40] There's a lot of debate and a lot of doubt about Jesus' resurrection.
[3533.90 → 3537.98] And then 15 to 20 years later, you have Paul coming onto the scene, right?
[3538.36 → 3540.12] The writer of many of the New Testament books.
[3540.12 → 3545.58] And I want to read for us some controversial and bold words that Paul says in public.
[3546.02 → 3548.52] This is 1 Corinthians 15, starting in verse 3.
[3549.28 → 3549.80] He writes,
[3549.80 → 3553.24] For what I received, I passed on to you as first importance.
[3553.92 → 3556.02] Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.
[3556.38 → 3557.26] He was buried.
[3557.40 → 3559.56] You know, they want to make sure he's not just resuscitated.
[3559.66 → 3560.26] He was buried.
[3560.72 → 3563.48] And that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.
[3564.02 → 3567.34] And that he appeared to Cafes, that's Peter, and then to the 12.
[3567.62 → 3574.74] After that, he appeared to more than 500 brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are
[3574.74 → 3576.70] still living, though some have fallen asleep.
[3577.32 → 3582.28] Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all, he appeared to me
[3582.28 → 3584.70] also, as to one abnormally born.
[3585.40 → 3589.28] Now, there's a lot we could say about that passage, but I want to highlight the importance
[3589.28 → 3590.46] and the boldness of it.
[3590.86 → 3592.70] Paul is speaking in Corinth.
[3593.34 → 3594.44] Very wealthy city.
[3594.84 → 3596.38] Very educated, elite city.
[3596.48 → 3599.68] They love bringing all the smart people together, debating philosophy.
[3599.68 → 3604.88] And Paul's got the guts to be in a city like Corinth saying, Jesus rose from the dead.
[3605.34 → 3610.06] He appeared to 500 people who are still alive, many of whom are still alive.
[3610.16 → 3611.40] You can find them and ask them.
[3611.50 → 3614.38] There were witnesses to this event.
[3616.00 → 3617.24] That is a bold claim.
[3617.34 → 3618.68] 50 to 20 years after it happened.
[3620.46 → 3625.06] All of us, I think, inside and outside the church have to grapple with Jesus' resurrection.
[3625.66 → 3627.92] It's something that many people have to sort of sort through.
[3627.92 → 3630.78] Even believers, when you grow up in the church, you'd be like, is this really true?
[3630.92 → 3633.02] Is what I've been told by my parents really true?
[3633.72 → 3635.44] And there are many books written.
[3636.28 → 3639.04] There are many documents and documentaries you can read.
[3639.12 → 3642.48] And many people have written books also to disprove the resurrection.
[3643.68 → 3648.46] And I want to highlight, I think, just a bit of my own grappling with this, which might be helpful.
[3649.70 → 3653.46] One of the things that I remember reading when I was a young adult is actually something my son Levi read.
[3653.76 → 3655.52] A book called More Than a Carpenter.
[3655.62 → 3656.46] Has anyone read that book?
[3656.46 → 3657.54] It's an older book.
[3657.66 → 3658.50] I see a couple of people.
[3659.46 → 3665.10] It's a book that basically seeks to go through all the arguments to make you trust the resurrection and the claims of Jesus.
[3665.46 → 3666.52] But one stood out to me.
[3666.58 → 3667.98] It's actually the same one that stood out to Levi.
[3668.50 → 3669.12] And that is this.
[3669.16 → 3670.16] This is the simple argument.
[3671.06 → 3675.56] We can trust that Jesus rose from the dead because his disciples died for it.
[3677.48 → 3678.46] Think about this.
[3678.46 → 3689.62] The argument is often that they hid the body out of shame, or they did some concealing work because they were so, yeah, they were sort of put in a public light for following this guy who didn't claim, didn't do what he claimed to be.
[3689.68 → 3690.48] And so they're just ashamed.
[3690.56 → 3691.22] And so they hid the body.
[3691.22 → 3704.82] And I would say, and this is the claim of the book, if they made this very elaborate lie to hide the resurrection of Jesus, to cover up their shame, it's one thing to do that for a little while when people are like, all right, whatever, believe what you want.
[3704.82 → 3712.88] It's another thing to do that when people start pressuring you, persecuting you, and then willing to kill you for what you believe.
[3712.96 → 3723.02] And I just want to say, if that were me, you know, if I'm having this elaborate conspiracy about Jesus' resurrection, I can promise you that it's the moment someone says, I'm going to kill you if you do not renounce what you believe.
[3723.28 → 3725.12] That's the moment we're like, all right, all right.
[3725.36 → 3726.28] Didn't actually happen.
[3726.54 → 3727.54] I'd like to stay alive.
[3727.94 → 3728.74] But this is important.
[3728.74 → 3736.74] One, Jesus' inner circle of disciples gave up their lives for the claim that he rose from the dead.
[3737.78 → 3745.38] More than that, they did it with a sense of confidence that they would rise from the dead.
[3746.12 → 3750.64] I mean, one of the most moving stories to me in the book of Acts is actually the story of Stephen's martyrdom.
[3751.12 → 3757.14] Acts chapter 7, Stephen, early leader in the church, they're persecuting him, and they stone him, a grisly, gruel way to kill someone.
[3757.14 → 3762.28] And that would be the moment where, like, if it's not going to, you know, if it's not real, you stand back, and you say it's not true.
[3762.50 → 3766.58] But Stephen has a vision of Jesus' glory, and then he does what Jesus does.
[3766.64 → 3774.12] He forgives those who are stoning him to death because he is confident that Jesus Christ's resurrection life is Stephen's to share.
[3774.90 → 3777.24] And the resurrection not just changes their lives.
[3777.80 → 3779.02] It changes how they die.
[3780.14 → 3783.58] That's how powerful the resurrection of Jesus Christ is.
[3784.42 → 3785.52] It changes everything.
[3787.14 → 3788.56] I want to read for us a quote.
[3788.68 → 3790.70] It comes from a man named Wolf hard Tannenberg.
[3790.96 → 3793.62] Two fun names in one service, Theophilus and Wolf hard.
[3794.06 → 3794.28] You know?
[3794.90 → 3799.78] I read this a few years ago, I think, at Easter, and I just think it continues to ring true.
[3800.64 → 3801.08] He writes,
[3801.08 → 3821.52] What do you think of that?
[3821.52 → 3827.70] Interestingly, C.S. Lewis, writer of the Chronicles of Narnia, a favourite book in the Unholy.
[3827.80 → 3829.34] I'm sure it's one of the favourites in yours as well.
[3829.80 → 3830.98] He did not grow up Christian.
[3831.50 → 3834.22] He didn't want to believe in Christianity until science could prove it.
[3834.28 → 3835.50] And he had people like J.R.
[3835.58 → 3838.74] Tolkien, Lord of the Rings, ministering to him and teaching him about Jesus.
[3838.96 → 3839.50] What a gift.
[3839.50 → 3845.34] And then he admitted very honestly, C.S. Lewis did, that he didn't want to deal with the resurrection
[3845.34 → 3851.18] or wrestle with it because he was afraid, and I quote, that it would interfere with his life.
[3851.88 → 3855.60] And then, of course, as people ministered to him, as he saw the lives of his friends who followed Jesus,
[3855.84 → 3859.88] he started to welcome the questions, welcome the conversation, and then, of course, he came to faith.
[3859.88 → 3866.76] And God used him to give us some of the best literature there is on faith and doubt and the resurrection.
[3867.92 → 3870.76] And I commend to you, by the way, if you're someone who's got your questions,
[3871.42 → 3873.82] you're showing up to hope out of an interest in Christianity,
[3873.96 → 3879.20] I do commend to you a book by C.S. Lewis that has been a companion to so many doubters and skeptics.
[3879.36 → 3880.68] It's called Mere Christianity.
[3880.88 → 3885.30] It's a great read, a bit of an older English, but worth every minute of your time.
[3885.30 → 3893.26] Jesus gave many convincing proofs that he was alive because it was so hard to believe.
[3893.98 → 3899.86] He took his time with his own disciples so they would know and have confidence that he was alive.
[3900.84 → 3903.38] But that's just the first thing he did in these 40 days.
[3903.46 → 3904.36] What's the second thing?
[3904.36 → 3910.40] We read in verse 3 that Jesus gave himself to teaching about the kingdom of God.
[3910.40 → 3915.54] This is so connected to Jesus saying he's alive.
[3915.62 → 3919.36] In fact, it's one thing to know Jesus rose from the dead, that a body came back to life.
[3919.44 → 3921.20] It's another thing to know what it means.
[3922.20 → 3926.26] And I would say, if I may be so bold, many Christians will know that Jesus died for them,
[3926.32 → 3927.12] that he's forgiven them.
[3927.14 → 3929.14] But when you ask, why does the resurrection matter?
[3929.20 → 3931.68] They're like, well, because he forgave our sins.
[3931.68 → 3936.36] And I want to suggest that this teaching on the kingdom of God is absolutely central to the Bible,
[3936.62 → 3937.70] to the teaching of Jesus.
[3937.94 → 3943.76] And I hope it expands and deepens and broadens how we see the beauty of the gospel itself.
[3945.14 → 3947.98] Now, this teaching of the kingdom is how Jesus started his ministry.
[3948.62 → 3950.90] In Mark chapter 1, verse 14 and 15, Jesus says,
[3950.90 → 3951.74] Good news.
[3952.54 → 3953.58] The time has come.
[3953.70 → 3955.24] The kingdom of God is near.
[3955.44 → 3956.76] Repent and believe.
[3956.88 → 3958.52] And he does that in all the gospel accounts, actually.
[3958.52 → 3961.98] He starts his ministry with the announcement of the arrival of the kingdom.
[3962.42 → 3967.18] After his resurrection, he's going around for 40 days teaching about the kingdom of God.
[3967.28 → 3968.82] So this clearly matters to Jesus.
[3969.28 → 3972.00] It's mentioned over 40 times in the Gospel of Matthew.
[3972.30 → 3976.60] And just because we don't use that language very much today doesn't mean it's not critically important.
[3977.96 → 3985.38] The kingdom of God, in very short summary form, is the rule of God over his whole world.
[3985.38 → 3990.30] It is God's rightful power and kingship over creation.
[3991.70 → 3994.66] And Jesus came to establish it.
[3995.22 → 4000.22] And you'll notice, by the way, in our passage, the disciples, which, by the way, all Jewish people at Jesus' time,
[4000.28 → 4001.70] were praying for the kingdom to come.
[4002.00 → 4003.44] They were hoping it would be in their lifetime.
[4003.70 → 4007.78] They all were fervently waiting for someone to come and establish God's kingdom.
[4007.88 → 4010.24] And notice what did they say to Jesus in verse 6.
[4010.24 → 4018.40] When they met together, they asked him, Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?
[4019.20 → 4024.18] And what their vision was, very important, they thought that God's kingdom was going to be God,
[4024.26 → 4028.80] through Jesus or some Messiah figure, reestablishing Jerusalem, rebuilding the temple,
[4029.10 → 4032.46] having this beautiful city on a hill, and all the nations would stream to it,
[4032.56 → 4035.64] and it would be God's special place, God's special people.
[4035.64 → 4041.82] What they did not know is that Jesus' vision for the kingdom was so much bigger.
[4042.72 → 4046.36] And I can't wait now to share with you how Jesus demonstrates his vision.
[4046.76 → 4050.46] Because after announcing in the beginning of his ministry, the kingdom of God is near,
[4050.54 → 4056.00] he then over and over and over again throughout his whole ministry shows people what the kingdom of God is like.
[4056.04 → 4056.92] Are you ready for this?
[4056.92 → 4065.50] Jesus shows them when he walks up to a man who is oppressed by demons, and he casts those demons out.
[4065.56 → 4069.78] It's his way of saying the kingdom of God has authority over satanic oppression,
[4070.08 → 4073.52] and they flee under the power of God through the ministry of Jesus.
[4074.38 → 4077.98] When Jesus is in a boat and a storm comes and threatens to wreck the ship,
[4077.98 → 4081.42] he puts his hand over the water, and the water goes still,
[4081.42 → 4087.54] because God's kingdom through Jesus has the authority to calm quote-unquote natural disasters.
[4088.78 → 4092.88] When Jesus goes to a group of lepers, and they want to be healed,
[4092.96 → 4097.06] Jesus touches a leper, and right there the body is healed,
[4097.12 → 4101.66] because in God's kingdom through Jesus' authority, there is no room for disease and sickness.
[4102.56 → 4103.44] It is healed.
[4105.02 → 4109.66] And then when Jesus sees a sick girl whose parents are upset with Jesus for not getting there fast enough,
[4109.66 → 4114.06] and he raises her back to life, Jesus is saying and demonstrating,
[4114.28 → 4121.90] in God's kingdom, which I have come to establish, death itself is undone, and life is here.
[4122.76 → 4124.58] Do you see now the kingdom of God?
[4125.18 → 4131.22] It is God's beautiful world eradicating sin, eradicating evil, eradicating satanic oppression,
[4131.40 → 4134.48] eradicating natural disasters, eradicating death itself.
[4134.48 → 4139.68] And so when Jesus makes a claim, the kingdom of God is near, whoa, that's a big claim.
[4140.38 → 4144.02] And then he does his ministry and says, this is exactly what it looks like.
[4144.04 → 4147.82] And I want us to see every miracle, all his teaching, his forgiveness of sins,
[4147.98 → 4153.42] is all a sneak preview of the beauty of the kingdom of God.
[4153.72 → 4157.82] What this world looks like when it's under the rightful rule of God our Father,
[4158.26 → 4159.52] through Jesus Christ his Son.
[4159.52 → 4165.56] And often in our membership classes or when I'm teaching Surge, our discipleship group,
[4166.24 → 4167.82] I often summarize the kingdom this way.
[4167.94 → 4175.30] Jesus has come to restore our lives and the whole creation to the way it was meant to be from the beginning,
[4175.74 → 4177.74] in harmony and love and peace.
[4178.28 → 4185.22] And through his death and resurrection, he seals forever that one day it will be again restored,
[4185.64 → 4189.22] perfected, and healed because of his finished work on the cross.
[4189.22 → 4189.34] Jesus.
[4191.64 → 4194.74] I was talking with someone after the 9 a.m. service who's visiting our church,
[4195.06 → 4197.98] and she studied in Bible college and was talking about how the kingdom,
[4198.06 → 4200.70] when she learned what the kingdom of God was, it changed her faith.
[4200.74 → 4202.54] And I said back to her, almost impulsively, I said,
[4202.80 → 4205.00] when I started understanding what Jesus was saying,
[4205.32 → 4206.88] when he preached the gospel of the kingdom,
[4207.08 → 4210.50] it made me realize how beautiful Christianity is,
[4211.12 → 4213.96] how good the news of Jesus is.
[4214.00 → 4218.28] In fact, I would say in part, that's what compelled me into ministry.
[4218.28 → 4221.92] That Jesus Christ did come to forgive sins, yes.
[4222.16 → 4224.42] He came to overthrow the power of death.
[4224.70 → 4227.02] He came to defeat the enemy of Satan.
[4227.24 → 4230.22] And he came to forgive the wretchedness of sin.
[4230.98 → 4233.26] The kingdom of God is here.
[4233.26 → 4238.62] That's what the resurrection is all about.
[4239.48 → 4243.02] That's why in his new resurrected body, in his new resurrected state,
[4243.16 → 4245.08] he's then saying, this is what it means.
[4245.86 → 4247.86] I overcame death and resurrection.
[4248.26 → 4254.12] Life has come to my creation, and it's yours to experience and to show the world.
[4254.12 → 4259.96] Now, this week, I found myself, and this may sound strange,
[4260.06 → 4266.50] but I found myself trying to imagine what Jesus' mood was in this 40-day period
[4266.50 → 4268.10] between resurrection and ascension.
[4268.86 → 4270.06] Like, what was his disposition?
[4271.06 → 4274.00] What was his facial expression while he was teaching
[4274.00 → 4276.56] and revealing his body in his resurrected form?
[4277.32 → 4279.44] This is my hunch.
[4279.66 → 4280.48] I can't prove this.
[4280.54 → 4281.38] There's not a verse on this.
[4281.38 → 4284.36] We do know that leading up to his death, Jesus was in agony.
[4284.54 → 4288.74] Garden of Gethsemane, he's in anguish that the cup of judgment of God's coming his way.
[4288.84 → 4290.64] He knows how brutal crucifixion is.
[4290.88 → 4292.90] He asks for the cup to pass him.
[4294.06 → 4297.76] But then we get to this period where he's in a new body, his resurrected body.
[4298.10 → 4299.26] He's with his disciples.
[4299.52 → 4300.72] He's preaching about the kingdom.
[4300.86 → 4305.74] And I have a feeling that Jesus was filled with joy.
[4305.74 → 4311.62] That as he showed his body to his disciples and stunned them, brought joy to their lives,
[4311.66 → 4313.26] as he teaches about the arrival of the kingdom,
[4313.48 → 4317.74] he is so full of joy because the work is finished.
[4318.80 → 4320.04] He defeated Satan.
[4320.60 → 4322.40] He forgave the power of sin.
[4322.82 → 4324.92] He overcame death.
[4325.64 → 4328.84] And he gets to show all his disciples how it's true for him,
[4328.84 → 4332.28] and by faith it's true for them that they get resurrection life.
[4333.66 → 4335.74] And Jesus knows what they don't yet know,
[4336.10 → 4339.04] that in just a few weeks' time, as he ascends to go be with his father
[4339.04 → 4343.14] and rule over the creation, that he's going to send the spirit.
[4344.02 → 4347.36] And the spirit is going to fill those disciples with the power of the resurrection.
[4347.68 → 4351.40] It's going to give them the same life that he had so they can do what he did,
[4351.60 → 4352.74] they can live how he lived,
[4352.74 → 4355.40] and they can demonstrate to the world the life of the kingdom
[4355.40 → 4359.22] by the infilling, empowering work of God the Spirit.
[4360.80 → 4362.04] In fact, I want to read for you a quote.
[4362.28 → 4364.34] I told Jonathan I wasn't going to steal this from him,
[4364.40 → 4366.64] and here I am in real time, honestly admitting,
[4366.94 → 4368.52] I'm stealing a quote from next week.
[4369.50 → 4373.64] It's from Augustine, a famous, very significant writer in Western Christian history.
[4374.16 → 4375.96] And he's sort of imagining the ascension.
[4376.08 → 4376.62] He writes this.
[4376.62 → 4376.90] He says,
[4376.90 → 4390.90] That's Jesus.
[4392.00 → 4393.88] Jesus knows that he ascends to the Father.
[4393.96 → 4396.56] He's going to send the spirit that will equip, empower,
[4396.76 → 4399.86] and enable his disciples to do the very thing he did.
[4400.08 → 4401.16] And what's Luke writing about?
[4401.16 → 4401.56] He says,
[4401.56 → 4405.46] That's what Jesus continues to do through the church,
[4405.90 → 4407.44] by the power of the Spirit.
[4408.26 → 4411.32] And I think that gives Jesus a lot of joy.
[4414.00 → 4417.80] Now there are two things I want to focus on as we bring this sermon to a close.
[4419.44 → 4420.54] The first is this.
[4420.62 → 4424.90] I think Jesus spends 40 days revealing his resurrected body
[4424.90 → 4430.70] to give his disciples confidence that he is alive.
[4431.16 → 4436.08] And everything the scriptures foretold, everything he has taught, everything he has done has come true
[4436.08 → 4438.88] and has been proved and sealed by his resurrection.
[4439.72 → 4444.18] He wants his church to have confidence that he appeared to Mary, he appeared to the disciples,
[4444.18 → 4446.88] he appeared to the 500, he appeared to Paul.
[4447.24 → 4451.18] And maybe I should add, he keeps appearing.
[4452.94 → 4454.04] Do you believe that?
[4454.46 → 4458.92] Yes, not in his resurrected body the way that he did for the 500 in 1 Corinthians 15.
[4458.92 → 4465.82] But Jesus keeps showing up and powerfully, mysteriously, through his spirit, bringing you and me to a place of saying,
[4466.18 → 4472.96] I believe, I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord according to the scriptures, that he died and was raised according to the scriptures
[4472.96 → 4474.66] and that he brought the kingdom of God.
[4474.96 → 4481.46] Our very gathering this morning is proof of the power of Jesus even today.
[4481.82 → 4482.52] Don't you think?
[4482.52 → 4489.36] One of the things that I love is when people share, even in our church, their testimonies.
[4489.42 → 4492.68] Whether it's baptism, I see Caden over there, or professions of faith.
[4492.76 → 4496.32] We have some of our students sharing their professions of faith in just a few weeks' time.
[4496.96 → 4499.48] And whenever you hear testimony, you hear ordinary life, right?
[4499.92 → 4505.44] Someone growing up, struggling with things, having family members, friends that run into a youth pastor.
[4505.56 → 4506.66] They see this very ordinary life.
[4506.66 → 4511.82] And yet, through all those ordinary conversations, the prayers of grandparents, the teacher that they had that cared for them,
[4512.18 → 4513.32] Jesus shows up.
[4513.96 → 4517.38] And they don't tell the story saying, and therefore, I just figured out what I want to.
[4517.44 → 4524.06] No, it's like, I've come to faith in Jesus by his word, through worship, through a friend, through a conversation, through suffering.
[4524.40 → 4525.66] Jesus keeps appearing.
[4527.08 → 4529.68] Your own story is a testament to that.
[4530.42 → 4534.50] The existence of the church is proof of that.
[4534.50 → 4544.38] And I think we just need to pause and, like, celebrate the gift it is that Jesus has opened your eyes and my eyes to the fact that he's alive.
[4545.24 → 4547.64] And he's alive and rules over his world.
[4549.14 → 4558.72] But secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, Jesus, and even Luke, in writing to Theophilus, his intention is bold witness.
[4558.72 → 4562.36] This is not just some historical details.
[4562.48 → 4565.16] This is not just a few tidbits of information to tuck away in your brain.
[4565.40 → 4575.12] The reason Jesus is sharing his body and teaching about the kingdom is so that the church could share the good news with the world.
[4575.12 → 4587.20] Don't forget that the reason this whole book of Acts was written was to convince this guy named Theophilus that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[4588.04 → 4589.06] It's the reason he wrote the book.
[4589.90 → 4591.88] Luke was not content just saying, hey, I'm a doctor.
[4592.00 → 4593.00] Here are some interesting tidbits.
[4593.00 → 4603.94] He says, I want you to understand that the person who rose from the dead is alive, rules over his world, and the Spirit of God has sent the church to make known that the kingdom is here.
[4605.10 → 4606.18] And here's my question.
[4607.42 → 4609.06] Who is your Theophilus?
[4610.88 → 4618.64] Luke was taking very seriously the curiosity and the questions of this man, writing very carefully and painstakingly about Jesus.
[4618.88 → 4620.08] Who's that person for you?
[4620.08 → 4629.64] You and I do not need to be professional apologists, studying all the evidence for the resurrection, knowing all the historical details so that we can make the best possible argument.
[4630.20 → 4645.12] But we do, according to 1 Peter 3, have to be able to give a reason for the hope that we have in Jesus with love and respect to anyone who asks us.
[4646.26 → 4647.12] Do you know that?
[4648.18 → 4649.10] That's every believer.
[4649.10 → 4652.10] And I want to suggest to you that all of us have a testimony.
[4652.90 → 4654.22] All of us have our own story.
[4654.32 → 4666.00] And maybe that's where you start, saying, I can't answer every question about every book in the Bible, but I can tell you how I came to know Jesus, how I came to trust his word, how I came to believe that in him is life through the church, through the worship of the church.
[4666.10 → 4670.72] I have seen and experienced and tasted the power of his resurrection.
[4670.72 → 4682.78] And I invite you, even now, in this service, to act on that person who comes to mind when you think who your Theophilus is.
[4682.78 → 4692.82] That coworker, that friend who's just genuinely interested, that neighbour who's asked why you leave on Sunday mornings, but you never say where you're going, they know.
[4692.82 → 4693.82] They know where you are.
[4693.82 → 4694.32] They know where you are.
[4694.32 → 4701.36] That classmate who is just genuinely curious about your faith and why you live a little bit differently and speak a little bit differently.
[4701.36 → 4715.50] Secondly, are you willing to take a step to have that conversation, to share why it is that you believe the most important thing that changes everything about your life, the future, and the world, and that is the resurrection of Jesus?
[4718.26 → 4720.68] Jesus is alive.
[4721.72 → 4730.08] And the last thing he says in the Gospel of Matthew to his disciples is a commission, sending them.
[4730.08 → 4732.56] He says to them, all authority.
[4732.60 → 4734.34] You want to talk about large claims that Jesus makes?
[4734.40 → 4736.26] This is why he's not just a teacher or a miracle worker.
[4736.38 → 4740.42] He says, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[4741.26 → 4747.34] Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, including British Columbia, where all the nations gather,
[4748.74 → 4751.42] baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
[4751.62 → 4756.14] teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you, and I'm with you.
[4756.14 → 4760.40] By the Spirit, right until the end.
[4762.16 → 4763.42] Jesus is alive.
[4764.32 → 4766.18] The kingdom of God has come.
[4767.46 → 4774.38] And finally, the reason Jesus hasn't returned is so that you and me, in our ordinary lives,
[4774.92 → 4778.80] can invite as many people as are willing to respond
[4778.80 → 4783.42] into the resurrection life of Christ before he comes.
[4784.76 → 4785.98] Would you join me in prayer?
[4793.58 → 4795.86] Jesus, we thank you for defeating the grave.
[4797.52 → 4799.76] We thank you for appearing to your disciples.
[4799.76 → 4803.30] Thank you for appearing to the 500.
[4804.54 → 4806.44] And we thank you for appearing to us.
[4807.46 → 4812.12] For the way that you in our own lives have brought about faith in us.
[4813.14 → 4815.52] And to those who struggle, those of us who have our doubts,
[4815.64 → 4819.20] I pray that you would strengthen and deepen our faith.
[4821.20 → 4824.48] Spirit, would you fill us with the life of the resurrection?
[4824.48 → 4831.06] Would you send us to our friends, neighbours, and family members
[4831.06 → 4835.20] to share the good news that Jesus is alive?
[4836.12 → 4838.90] It is in his mighty name that we pray.
[4839.58 → 4839.90] Amen.
[4841.48 → 4845.42] Would you stand and sing with me our story through the words,
[4845.60 → 4846.12] King of Kings.
[4846.18 → 4847.40] Let's stand and worship together.
[4847.40 → 4847.52] Amen.
[4854.48 → 4866.84] In the darkness we were waiting,
[4867.08 → 4870.58] without hope, without light.
[4870.82 → 4873.96] Till from heaven you came running,
[4874.40 → 4878.04] there was mercy in your eyes.
[4878.04 → 4881.46] To fulfill the law and prophets,
[4881.46 → 4885.00] To a virgin came the word.
[4885.38 → 4888.58] From a throne of endless glory,
[4888.58 → 4892.60] To a cradle in the dirt.
[4898.60 → 4901.70] Praise the Father,
[4902.42 → 4905.14] Praise the Son,
[4906.10 → 4908.94] Praise the Spirit,
[4908.94 → 4912.06] Three in one.
[4912.06 → 4916.06] God of glory,
[4916.06 → 4919.96] I just did.
[4920.62 → 4927.98] Praise forever to the King of Kings.
[4931.98 → 4935.58] To reveal the kingdom coming,
[4935.58 → 4938.70] And to reconcile the lost.
[4938.70 → 4942.70] To redeem the whole creation,
[4942.70 → 4946.52] You did not despise the cross.
[4946.52 → 4950.02] For even in your suffering,
[4950.38 → 4953.74] You sought to the other side.
[4953.98 → 4957.10] Knowing this was our salvation,
[4957.66 → 4960.70] Jesus for our sake you died.
[4960.70 → 4961.82] Praise the Lord,
[4961.82 → 4969.82] Praise the Father,
[4969.82 → 4972.82] Praise the Son,
[4972.82 → 4976.82] Praise the Spirit,
[4976.82 → 4980.82] Three in one.
[4980.82 → 4984.82] God of glory,
[4984.82 → 4985.88] God of glory,
[4985.88 → 4987.94] I just said
[4987.94 → 4996.14] Raise forever to the King of Kings.
[4999.94 → 5002.94] And the morning that you rose,
[5002.94 → 5007.20] All heaven held its breath,
[5007.56 → 5010.74] Till that stone was moved for good,
[5010.74 → 5017.98] For the Lamb had conquered death, and the dead rose from their tombs.
[5018.34 → 5028.74] And the angels stood in awe, for the souls of all who died, to the Father are restored.
[5029.14 → 5035.66] Then the church of Christ was born, then the Spirit lit the flame.
[5035.66 → 5042.70] Now this gospel, truth of all, shall not heal, shall not faint.
[5043.06 → 5049.48] By His blood and in His name, in His freedom I am free.
[5049.96 → 5056.60] For the love of Jesus Christ, who has resurrected me.
[5056.60 → 5075.60] Praise the Father, praise the Son, praise the Spirit, three in one.
[5075.60 → 5082.42] God of glory, majesty.
[5084.10 → 5090.80] Praise forever to the King of kings.
[5090.92 → 5097.78] Praise forever to the King of kings.
[5097.78 → 5102.78] Praise forever to the King of kings.
[5102.78 → 5105.18] Praise forever to the King of kings.
[5105.18 → 5107.18] Praise forever to the King of kings.
[5107.18 → 5109.18] Praise forever to the King of kings.
[5109.18 → 5109.24] Amen.
[5114.66 → 5118.68] Before we receive God's blessing and sing our final song, I want to make two announcements.
[5118.84 → 5123.08] One is, we didn't mention today, but today is Red Dress Day.
[5123.08 → 5127.98] And if you're not aware of that, it's a day when people remember and intercede for the
[5127.98 → 5130.10] many missing and murdered indigenous women.
[5130.84 → 5133.58] And so I just encourage you today is a day to pray for that.
[5134.02 → 5135.60] That's a serious injustice in our history.
[5135.72 → 5139.70] We want to be as Christians interceding for those who have lost loved ones and those who
[5139.70 → 5141.16] are still looking for loved ones.
[5142.78 → 5148.12] Secondly, I want to remind us that one of the ways that the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[5148.12 → 5151.74] transformed the church is by the way people handle their money.
[5151.74 → 5156.02] You know, Peter already mentioned this earlier, but the way that the church responds to the
[5156.02 → 5157.90] resurrection of Jesus is generosity.
[5158.60 → 5161.68] And so I invite you today to think of how it is that you can give.
[5162.08 → 5163.90] There are many ways that we can give in our church.
[5164.00 → 5168.32] You can talk to our deacons, or you could give near the coffee bar where the deacons are at
[5168.32 → 5168.74] the back.
[5169.04 → 5172.54] But we want our worship to include radical generosity.
[5175.12 → 5178.98] There's a quote that is attributed to, but no one actually knows if it's from Martin Luther.
[5178.98 → 5183.12] But he says this, the gospel is a caged lion.
[5183.94 → 5185.82] It does not need to be defended.
[5186.36 → 5189.74] It just needs to be released.
[5190.86 → 5191.52] Don't you like that image?
[5191.58 → 5192.72] The gospel is a caged lion.
[5192.84 → 5194.14] It does not need your defence.
[5194.66 → 5196.40] It just needs to be shared.
[5198.62 → 5203.12] Jesus Christ himself goes with you by the power of his spirit to make him known in your work,
[5203.40 → 5204.64] in your friendship, in your neighbourhood.
[5204.64 → 5207.98] You do not do this in your own strength, but you do it with his.
[5208.66 → 5213.16] And so let me read for us again those words from Matthew 28 that commission us to make
[5213.16 → 5214.04] the gospel known.
[5214.16 → 5218.14] Jesus says, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[5218.98 → 5228.12] Therefore, go into your workplace, into your school, into your neighbourhood, and make disciples
[5228.12 → 5233.10] of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
[5233.48 → 5236.28] teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[5236.38 → 5241.34] And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[5241.44 → 5243.08] Together we say, amen.
[5243.58 → 5246.70] Let's sing our final song about Jesus, the lion and the lamb.
[5246.70 → 5276.68] Let's sing our final song about Jesus, the lion and the lamb.
[5276.70 → 5281.18] And every chain will break.
[5281.62 → 5284.78] Broken hearts declare his grace.
[5284.90 → 5288.04] Who can stop the Lord Almighty?
[5289.34 → 5293.78] Dark God is the lion, the lion of Judah.
[5294.04 → 5298.54] He's roaring with power and fighting our battles.
[5299.10 → 5302.50] Every knee will bow before him.
[5302.50 → 5307.78] The dark God is the lamb, the lamb that was slain.
[5308.14 → 5312.42] From the sins of the world, his blood breaks the chains.
[5312.90 → 5316.90] And every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb.
[5317.46 → 5320.50] Every knee will bow before him.
[5320.50 → 5324.12] The dark God is the lion and the lamb.
[5324.12 → 5326.30] The king of kings.
[5326.30 → 5327.18] The king of kings.
[5327.18 → 5329.56] The king of kings.
[5329.56 → 5332.30] So open up the gates.
[5332.58 → 5335.92] Make way before the king of kings.
[5336.68 → 5337.24] The king of kings.
[5337.24 → 5341.00] The king of kings.
[5341.00 → 5341.70] The king of kings.
[5341.70 → 5349.14] here to set the captives free who can stop the Lord Almighty
[5349.14 → 5358.20] dark God is the lion of Judah he's roaring with power and fighting our
[5358.20 → 5362.66] battles every evil bow before
[5362.66 → 5368.10] dark God is the lamb that was slain
[5368.10 → 5374.74] the sin of the world his blood breaks the chain
[5374.74 → 5378.42] bow for the lion
[5378.42 → 5383.22] every evil bow before
[5398.10 → 5412.74] who can stop the Lord Almighty who can stop the Lord Almighty who can stop the Lord
[5412.74 → 5419.38] who can stop the Lord
[5419.38 → 5433.06] dark God is the lion of Judah he's roaring with power and fighting our battles every
[5433.06 → 5435.06] evil bow before
[5435.06 → 5437.06] the
[5437.06 → 5439.70] dark God is the lamb
[5439.70 → 5441.70] the lamb that was slain
[5441.70 → 5443.38] for the sins of the world
[5443.38 → 5447.38] his blood breaks the chains
[5447.38 → 5451.38] every knee will bow before the lion and the lamb
[5451.38 → 5453.70] every knee will bow before
[5453.70 → 5455.54] umbrage
[5455.54 → 5457.10] of rose
[5457.10 → 5459.34] Rudolph
