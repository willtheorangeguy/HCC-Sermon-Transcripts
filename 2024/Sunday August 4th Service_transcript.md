[0.00 --> 9.28]  Thank you, Florence.
[15.02 --> 16.18]  It's good to be together.
[17.10 --> 19.28]  I'm glad not everyone went camping.
[21.02 --> 23.16]  I have a few people to talk to, so that's good.
[24.52 --> 29.44]  Today we're going to continue our series on the hard sayings of Jesus
[29.44 --> 30.46]  that we've done this summer.
[31.62 --> 35.92]  So much of what Jesus said encourages us,
[36.98 --> 42.06]  but sometimes what he said was hard to hear or at times confusing.
[43.36 --> 46.78]  Yet all that he said is for our benefit.
[47.08 --> 49.98]  All of what he said are words of life,
[50.14 --> 53.88]  even if it causes us to struggle with those words.
[53.88 --> 60.56]  Last week, Pastor Dave spoke on the passage he preached on,
[60.62 --> 62.68]  but he did it in the context of discipleship,
[62.90 --> 65.30]  the cost of following Jesus.
[66.46 --> 69.36]  If you haven't heard the message, go back and listen to it.
[69.70 --> 70.30]  Very good.
[70.98 --> 73.04]  Today I'm going to deal with another passage,
[73.34 --> 76.22]  but I'm going to deal with it in the context of mission,
[76.74 --> 80.32]  of the missio deo, the mission of God,
[80.32 --> 83.86]  which started already in the Old Testament in the beginning
[83.86 --> 85.72]  and runs all the way through Scripture,
[86.14 --> 87.46]  the mission of God.
[87.88 --> 89.88]  And we're going to read out of Luke 10.
[90.10 --> 93.38]  So I put a bit of an extra piece on there
[93.38 --> 95.28]  because I think it's important to understand
[95.28 --> 97.62]  the context of the particular passage
[97.62 --> 98.86]  that we're dealing with today.
[99.36 --> 100.74]  So look at it with me, Luke 10,
[101.26 --> 102.16]  verse 1 through 21.
[102.16 --> 107.82]  After this, the Lord appointed 72 others
[107.82 --> 110.64]  and sent them two by two ahead of him
[110.64 --> 113.44]  to every town and place where he was about to go.
[114.18 --> 115.26]  He told them,
[115.44 --> 118.82]  the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[119.54 --> 121.42]  Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore,
[121.52 --> 124.54]  to send out workers into his harvest field.
[124.72 --> 127.02]  And you hear the mission language.
[127.62 --> 132.00]  Go, I'm sending you like lambs among wolves.
[132.94 --> 135.18]  Don't take a purse or a bag or sandals.
[135.48 --> 136.98]  Do not greet anyone on the road.
[137.58 --> 138.40]  When you enter a house,
[138.68 --> 140.08]  first say peace to this house.
[140.38 --> 141.86]  If someone who promotes peace is there,
[141.94 --> 143.04]  your peace will rest on them.
[143.28 --> 144.70]  If not, it will return to you.
[145.44 --> 148.20]  Stay there eating and drinking whatever they give you,
[148.36 --> 149.94]  for the worker deserves his wages.
[150.64 --> 152.74]  Don't move around from house to house.
[153.30 --> 154.90]  When you enter a town and are welcome,
[154.90 --> 155.92]  eat what is offered to you,
[156.06 --> 157.56]  heal the sick who are there,
[157.70 --> 161.38]  and tell them the kingdom of God has come near to you.
[161.38 --> 163.78]  But when you enter a town and are not welcome,
[163.92 --> 165.18]  go into its streets and say,
[165.66 --> 167.62]  even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet
[167.62 --> 168.56]  as a warning to you.
[168.84 --> 169.88]  Yet be sure of this,
[170.18 --> 173.04]  the kingdom of God has come near.
[173.90 --> 174.72]  I tell you,
[174.78 --> 176.64]  it would be more bearable on that day for Sodom
[176.64 --> 177.82]  than for that town.
[178.96 --> 182.52]  Whoever listens to you listens to me.
[182.66 --> 184.30]  Whoever rejects you rejects me.
[184.72 --> 187.96]  But whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me.
[188.92 --> 192.06]  The 72 returned with joy and said,
[192.46 --> 195.08]  Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.
[195.64 --> 196.42]  And he replied,
[196.42 --> 199.80]  I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
[200.44 --> 201.62]  And this is part of the difficult,
[201.78 --> 202.80]  the hard thing Jesus said.
[202.86 --> 203.68]  We're going to talk about that.
[204.22 --> 207.00]  I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions
[207.00 --> 208.68]  and to overcome all the power of the enemy.
[209.08 --> 210.20]  Nothing will harm you.
[210.76 --> 214.28]  However, do not rejoice that the spirit submit to you,
[214.28 --> 217.24]  but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
[217.96 --> 218.72]  At that time,
[218.80 --> 219.06]  Jesus,
[219.36 --> 221.20]  full of joy through the Holy Spirit,
[221.34 --> 221.56]  said,
[221.90 --> 222.56]  I praise you,
[222.66 --> 222.92]  Father,
[223.28 --> 224.38]  Lord of heaven and earth,
[224.50 --> 227.46]  because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned
[227.46 --> 229.44]  and revealed them to little children.
[230.12 --> 230.32]  Yes,
[230.40 --> 230.64]  Father,
[230.76 --> 233.96]  for this is what you were pleased to do.
[236.02 --> 236.74]  All right.
[236.74 --> 239.14]  There's Jesus,
[239.72 --> 240.48]  and then the 12,
[240.66 --> 241.58]  and now the 72,
[242.14 --> 243.68]  carrying out the mission of God,
[243.98 --> 247.44]  to reclaim and renew all things in the name of the Father,
[247.80 --> 252.90]  to restore God's peace and reign over all the earth,
[253.20 --> 254.98]  as it is rightly his,
[255.82 --> 259.44]  and to overthrow all that goes against God's kingdom.
[259.80 --> 261.68]  That's kind of what's going on here in a nutshell.
[261.68 --> 262.96]  And in this,
[263.18 --> 264.08]  they go about,
[264.30 --> 267.48]  sometimes they disturb the status quo of their culture.
[269.02 --> 269.16]  You know,
[269.36 --> 271.72]  the word world is often used,
[271.80 --> 273.10]  and the word world is,
[274.26 --> 275.90]  they're trying to say,
[276.16 --> 277.90]  it's what opposes God's kingdom.
[278.22 --> 279.30]  That's what the world is.
[279.68 --> 281.18]  The world is defensive,
[281.52 --> 283.74]  and refuses to accept the gospel message,
[283.82 --> 285.18]  which in heart is saying,
[285.60 --> 288.02]  you need to be saved.
[288.02 --> 288.06]  Right?
[290.82 --> 292.24]  And Jesus sends people,
[292.50 --> 293.12]  the people out,
[293.20 --> 294.20]  the 72 disciples,
[294.32 --> 296.60]  on a mission of God's kingdom come,
[296.82 --> 298.50]  of salvation coming.
[300.28 --> 300.86]  Now, you know,
[300.96 --> 302.44]  in the beginning of this passage,
[302.56 --> 302.72]  right,
[302.78 --> 303.96]  we read,
[304.04 --> 304.20]  he says,
[304.28 --> 305.46]  I'm sending you,
[305.64 --> 306.34]  so just picture,
[306.46 --> 307.32]  this is the mission trip,
[307.42 --> 307.62]  right?
[307.92 --> 308.12]  Jesus,
[308.58 --> 310.08]  how many of you watched The Chosen?
[311.68 --> 311.92]  Yeah,
[312.26 --> 314.42]  my wife and I have watched quite a few of the seasons,
[314.52 --> 315.32]  but there's this one,
[316.00 --> 316.98]  in one of the episodes,
[316.98 --> 318.04]  they have this moment,
[318.18 --> 318.32]  right,
[318.40 --> 319.60]  where they're sent out,
[319.68 --> 320.18]  and it kind of,
[320.66 --> 320.80]  you know,
[320.82 --> 321.66]  whatever you think of The Chosen,
[321.76 --> 323.04]  I think it's really good in a lot of ways,
[323.36 --> 324.34]  it was kind of cool,
[324.46 --> 325.72]  watching these disciples,
[326.50 --> 327.76]  suddenly sent out,
[328.60 --> 328.94]  and saying,
[329.06 --> 329.24]  okay,
[329.46 --> 329.96]  you know,
[330.00 --> 330.30]  go.
[331.50 --> 332.12]  And they go,
[332.32 --> 333.00]  okay,
[333.14 --> 333.86]  but aren't you coming?
[333.92 --> 334.02]  No,
[334.04 --> 334.14]  no,
[334.28 --> 334.48]  go.
[334.84 --> 335.54]  And they go,
[335.62 --> 335.80]  right?
[335.84 --> 336.82]  And they go into these towns,
[336.82 --> 337.08]  and,
[337.52 --> 337.70]  you know,
[337.74 --> 339.72]  and you just feel the awkwardness of it all.
[340.80 --> 341.02]  You know,
[341.06 --> 342.20]  it kind of reminded me of,
[343.20 --> 345.24]  when we first started Hope Community,
[345.24 --> 346.10]  and we had these,
[346.10 --> 348.76]  these fishing stories.
[349.20 --> 351.10]  I was on a board of leaders,
[351.74 --> 354.16]  and then we were supposed to share our fishing stories,
[354.52 --> 357.20]  and fishing stories were ones where you talk to somebody
[357.20 --> 358.98]  about God's kingdom,
[359.16 --> 359.82]  about faith,
[359.90 --> 360.64]  about salvation,
[360.64 --> 363.20]  and we had monthly meetings,
[363.30 --> 363.56]  and so,
[363.74 --> 364.00]  okay,
[364.34 --> 364.48]  hey,
[364.56 --> 366.30]  how did it go this month for you,
[366.42 --> 367.68]  with your fishing stories?
[368.60 --> 369.98]  And I came out of tradition,
[369.98 --> 371.88]  where we didn't do fishing stories,
[371.96 --> 372.22]  really,
[373.20 --> 373.80]  which is sad.
[374.16 --> 374.62]  But anyways,
[374.90 --> 375.26]  you know,
[375.32 --> 375.44]  so,
[375.82 --> 377.26]  and this new person,
[377.26 --> 377.96]  who was on the board,
[378.20 --> 379.66]  had a million fishing stories,
[379.66 --> 381.02]  of people that she was talking to,
[381.08 --> 381.54]  and how it was going.
[381.84 --> 383.64]  And I couldn't even find my fishing rod.
[384.76 --> 384.92]  So,
[385.20 --> 385.88]  you know,
[385.92 --> 386.82]  I had to learn,
[387.14 --> 388.52]  how to do this.
[388.52 --> 389.40]  But I appreciate,
[389.50 --> 389.74]  you know,
[390.26 --> 392.56]  how awkward it must have felt.
[393.20 --> 393.38]  So,
[393.44 --> 393.54]  okay,
[393.58 --> 394.34]  go to this town.
[394.64 --> 394.92]  You don't,
[394.98 --> 395.72]  you don't know anybody.
[396.74 --> 397.62]  And start.
[399.04 --> 400.00]  What do you say?
[400.20 --> 400.54]  How do you,
[400.66 --> 401.98]  how do you step into that?
[402.06 --> 402.64]  What's it like?
[402.70 --> 403.52]  People come up to you.
[403.90 --> 404.26]  And,
[404.26 --> 404.30]  and,
[404.30 --> 404.52]  and,
[404.56 --> 404.74]  you know,
[404.86 --> 405.82]  accept the vision.
[406.00 --> 406.54]  And he said,
[406.64 --> 407.48]  but I'm sending you.
[407.58 --> 407.64]  Well,
[407.64 --> 407.92]  well,
[407.92 --> 408.74]  what's it like?
[409.08 --> 409.24]  Well,
[409.30 --> 411.06]  you're kind of like lambs,
[411.48 --> 413.16]  going to visit wolves.
[417.34 --> 418.50]  That's going to be the mission.
[418.52 --> 419.24]  T-shirt.
[420.92 --> 421.32]  Right?
[422.04 --> 422.38]  Yeah,
[422.48 --> 423.12]  I'm a lamb.
[423.58 --> 424.42]  Going to wolves.
[424.78 --> 424.98]  You know,
[425.04 --> 426.60]  it doesn't sound particularly inviting,
[426.66 --> 426.92]  does it?
[427.04 --> 427.48]  And then what?
[427.58 --> 428.34]  Carry no purse,
[428.42 --> 428.90]  no bag,
[429.22 --> 429.92]  extra sandals.
[430.18 --> 430.30]  No,
[430.34 --> 430.88]  none of that.
[431.22 --> 432.00]  Greet no one.
[432.14 --> 433.22]  Don't get distracted.
[433.64 --> 434.98]  Don't get distracted by anything.
[435.34 --> 436.96]  Stay focused on the mission.
[437.06 --> 437.38]  The mission.
[437.68 --> 437.96]  Jesus.
[439.24 --> 441.16]  Not on what you think you need.
[442.52 --> 442.92]  And,
[442.92 --> 444.72]  our church has done mission trips,
[444.90 --> 447.26]  and we prepare really quite well for them.
[447.72 --> 448.06]  And I wonder,
[448.14 --> 450.90]  what would you think you had to bring if Jesus said,
[450.98 --> 451.10]  okay,
[451.16 --> 451.94]  you're going to go into these towns.
[452.06 --> 452.30]  Okay,
[452.38 --> 452.56]  okay.
[452.80 --> 454.04]  I've got to get my stuff together.
[454.82 --> 455.64]  Where's my phone?
[456.14 --> 456.54]  Do they,
[456.66 --> 457.46]  I need a charger,
[457.56 --> 457.72]  right,
[457.78 --> 457.98]  Jesus?
[458.18 --> 458.32]  Right?
[458.36 --> 458.54]  I mean,
[458.58 --> 458.72]  you know,
[458.76 --> 460.96]  all these things that we would think we would need.
[460.96 --> 462.86]  And Jesus is saying,
[463.00 --> 463.28]  nothing.
[464.84 --> 465.24]  Nothing.
[465.52 --> 465.70]  Me.
[466.50 --> 467.40]  That's all you need.
[467.52 --> 468.28]  Nothing else.
[468.98 --> 470.04]  Whatever you think you,
[470.04 --> 470.88]  you imagine you need,
[470.92 --> 471.24]  you don't.
[471.52 --> 475.10]  And Jesus' mission order makes us realize that we're often asking the wrong questions.
[475.22 --> 476.50]  Nothing wrong with preparation.
[476.90 --> 478.90]  But Jesus is trying to get them to see something.
[479.32 --> 480.58]  It's not what you need,
[480.64 --> 484.00]  it's who you need on this mission adventure.
[484.00 --> 484.12]  Scripture.
[488.22 --> 489.10]  Hebrews 12,
[489.54 --> 490.84]  one of my favorite passages,
[492.08 --> 493.36]  kind of says it this way.
[496.28 --> 496.98]  It says,
[499.46 --> 501.98]  it says,
[502.10 --> 503.76]  keep your eyes focused on Jesus.
[504.56 --> 504.84]  Right?
[505.04 --> 507.38]  We're surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,
[507.94 --> 512.28]  and so let's throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles.
[512.28 --> 513.96]  Let us run the race with perseverance,
[514.10 --> 515.62]  the race marked out for us.
[516.30 --> 517.12]  And then now here,
[517.30 --> 520.28]  fixing our eyes on Jesus.
[522.04 --> 522.92]  Who did what?
[523.08 --> 523.60]  The pioneer,
[523.74 --> 524.62]  the perfecter of our faith.
[524.84 --> 525.40]  And here we go.
[525.66 --> 527.68]  For the joy set before him,
[527.74 --> 528.96]  he endured the cross,
[529.08 --> 529.96]  scorning it shame,
[530.26 --> 532.88]  and sat down at the right hand of God,
[532.92 --> 533.24]  the Father,
[533.44 --> 534.36]  of God's throne.
[536.86 --> 539.14]  Keep your eyes on Jesus.
[540.08 --> 542.18]  That's kind of what Jesus is getting them to do.
[542.62 --> 543.92]  You're going with nothing.
[544.26 --> 545.18]  Now keep your eyes on Jesus.
[545.60 --> 547.16]  And they're sent out two by two.
[547.34 --> 551.22]  This is a community project.
[552.02 --> 553.60]  You're not sent out alone.
[553.78 --> 555.76]  You need to stay focused on Jesus,
[555.98 --> 558.90]  and you'll need one another to stay focused on Jesus.
[559.52 --> 560.84]  You'll need that for encouragement.
[561.22 --> 562.82]  No one should go it alone.
[563.54 --> 565.36]  We rely on one another.
[565.36 --> 568.52]  That's why we gather together.
[568.68 --> 569.94]  That's why each Sunday,
[570.42 --> 572.02]  we send you out.
[572.38 --> 572.64]  We.
[573.02 --> 573.38]  We.
[574.46 --> 575.64]  It's not a me thing.
[575.70 --> 576.36]  It's a we thing.
[577.72 --> 579.64]  We remind one another
[579.64 --> 580.94]  to keep our eyes on Jesus
[580.94 --> 583.18]  because it's so easy to get distracted.
[583.86 --> 585.12]  And too often in our culture,
[585.30 --> 587.70]  we make faith an individualistic matter.
[587.70 --> 588.60]  Well, that, you know,
[588.66 --> 589.62]  that's my faith.
[589.70 --> 591.28]  No, this is our faith.
[592.88 --> 594.60]  This is our faith.
[595.50 --> 596.62]  We're in this together.
[596.62 --> 601.04]  And Jesus is honest about the mission.
[602.24 --> 604.40]  Yeah, there's wolves out there.
[604.76 --> 605.54]  There's opposition.
[605.78 --> 606.48]  There's distractions.
[606.70 --> 607.48]  There's hostility.
[608.04 --> 610.20]  And sometimes all you can do is try,
[610.36 --> 611.94]  and you try to share the gospel,
[612.20 --> 613.30]  and then you walk away
[613.30 --> 614.48]  because they don't want to hear it,
[614.58 --> 615.70]  and you shake the dust off.
[615.74 --> 617.16]  You say, okay, that's the end of that one.
[617.62 --> 620.32]  But other times you're heard,
[620.54 --> 621.62]  and somehow you hear the hospitality.
[622.42 --> 623.64]  Have the meals together.
[624.14 --> 625.46]  Hang out with each other.
[625.46 --> 627.90]  With those who don't know Jesus.
[628.98 --> 630.16]  Have some food.
[630.30 --> 631.68]  Have some conversations.
[633.60 --> 634.60]  But sometimes,
[635.20 --> 638.38]  sometimes you're confronted with genuine evil.
[640.52 --> 643.76]  And God's power in us
[643.76 --> 647.42]  is there to overcome that evil.
[648.84 --> 653.36]  And we read in verse 17 through 20.
[653.62 --> 654.86]  Let me read it to you once more.
[654.86 --> 654.90]  Lord.
[655.38 --> 657.06]  The 72 returned with joy and said,
[657.14 --> 659.62]  Lord, even demons submit to us in your name.
[659.92 --> 660.82]  And he replied,
[661.18 --> 663.20]  I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
[664.42 --> 664.64]  Right?
[664.68 --> 665.50]  And you think, okay.
[665.88 --> 668.24]  You know, even the demons listen to us.
[668.30 --> 668.86]  I saw Satan fall.
[668.96 --> 670.34]  You know, so what's going on here, right?
[670.58 --> 671.64]  I have given you authority
[671.64 --> 673.24]  to trample on snakes and scorpions
[673.24 --> 675.52]  and overcome all the power of the enemy.
[675.52 --> 677.20]  Nothing will harm you.
[678.08 --> 680.32]  And when the 72 returned,
[680.72 --> 682.98]  they're excitedly reported that even the demons
[682.98 --> 685.90]  were subject to them in Jesus' name.
[685.90 --> 688.64]  And Jesus says,
[689.06 --> 691.20]  I saw Satan fall from heaven.
[691.20 --> 693.08]  And then he says,
[693.14 --> 693.96]  I've given you authority
[693.96 --> 695.90]  to tread on snakes and scorpions
[695.90 --> 699.16]  if indeed they are in your way.
[700.20 --> 701.38]  Some of you might have heard of
[701.38 --> 703.78]  groups of Christian people
[703.78 --> 705.54]  who historically have kind of,
[705.76 --> 707.26]  they were called snake handlers
[707.26 --> 707.80]  and they would go,
[708.36 --> 709.74]  have part of their church services,
[709.84 --> 711.24]  they'd hold on to snakes on purpose
[711.24 --> 712.64]  and get bit and poisoned
[712.64 --> 714.94]  and just as a test of faith.
[715.20 --> 717.22]  That's not what Jesus is talking about.
[718.02 --> 718.84]  Jesus isn't saying,
[719.06 --> 720.40]  well, there's a scorpion.
[720.54 --> 721.02]  Bite me.
[721.22 --> 723.76]  You know, that's not what's going on here.
[723.86 --> 724.40]  Jesus is saying,
[724.48 --> 725.84]  listen, stuff will happen on the way
[725.84 --> 727.28]  and I'm with you in it all.
[727.98 --> 729.24]  That's what's going on here.
[731.30 --> 732.30]  Jesus says,
[732.40 --> 733.90]  even in the face of violence,
[735.06 --> 736.12]  in the face of injustice,
[736.68 --> 738.60]  evil cannot destroy the one
[738.60 --> 740.12]  who goes in Jesus' name.
[741.06 --> 742.42]  Now, you might ask,
[742.42 --> 743.60]  well, does this mean then
[743.60 --> 744.88]  that, you know,
[744.96 --> 746.06]  we won't suffer?
[747.28 --> 747.68]  No.
[748.66 --> 749.90]  That's not what it's saying here.
[750.16 --> 752.72]  It means that God's will will prevail.
[753.24 --> 754.32]  I mean, if you look at the life
[754.32 --> 755.60]  of many of the twelve,
[756.22 --> 757.10]  right, they were martyred.
[758.22 --> 758.84]  Well, they could have said,
[758.88 --> 760.50]  well, you said we weren't going to get harmed.
[760.66 --> 762.02]  That's not what's going on here.
[762.54 --> 764.20]  God's will will prevail.
[765.22 --> 766.64]  You will overcome.
[768.06 --> 769.98]  Matthew 16, 8 says it rather well
[769.98 --> 771.24]  where Jesus said,
[771.24 --> 772.52]  I tell you that you are Peter
[772.52 --> 773.82]  and on this rock,
[773.92 --> 775.08]  I will build my church
[775.08 --> 775.70]  and what will happen?
[775.70 --> 777.34]  And the gates of Hades
[777.34 --> 778.52]  will not overcome it.
[780.12 --> 780.70]  Right?
[781.36 --> 783.00]  The gates of hell
[783.00 --> 784.70]  will not prevail.
[784.70 --> 788.04]  that mean I might get hurt sometimes?
[788.16 --> 789.40]  Yeah, probably.
[792.24 --> 793.44]  But Jesus will prevail.
[794.10 --> 795.40]  Jesus is our power.
[796.24 --> 796.74]  Now, there's,
[796.90 --> 798.10]  but here in our passage,
[798.22 --> 799.40]  there's potential danger
[799.40 --> 800.36]  when they say,
[800.60 --> 802.52]  even the demons are subject to us,
[802.76 --> 804.14]  even though they said it was in Jesus' name.
[804.36 --> 807.48]  They say this as if this was the epitome of power.
[807.48 --> 810.12]  And you can see why.
[812.22 --> 812.52]  I mean,
[812.62 --> 813.94]  if you cast out a demon,
[814.04 --> 817.08]  that's got to be invigorating
[817.08 --> 818.78]  in some way.
[820.06 --> 820.18]  You know,
[820.28 --> 820.30]  but,
[820.52 --> 822.30]  and look what happened in the past.
[822.50 --> 823.20]  Luke 9,
[823.70 --> 823.94]  right?
[824.02 --> 824.70]  There's another time
[824.70 --> 826.02]  when the 12 were there.
[826.40 --> 827.56]  And a man in the crowd called out,
[827.60 --> 827.82]  Teacher,
[828.12 --> 828.80]  I beg you,
[828.86 --> 829.60]  look at my son
[829.60 --> 830.58]  for he's my only child.
[830.88 --> 832.40]  A spirit seizes him,
[832.44 --> 832.68]  a demon,
[832.90 --> 833.98]  and he suddenly screams
[833.98 --> 835.32]  and it throws him into convulsions
[835.32 --> 836.34]  and he foams at the mouth.
[836.72 --> 838.32]  It scarcely ever leaves him
[838.32 --> 840.00]  and is destroying him.
[840.26 --> 842.18]  I beg your disciples to drive it out,
[842.46 --> 844.36]  but they could not.
[847.44 --> 848.64]  And I'm sure some of those guys
[848.64 --> 849.04]  might have thought,
[849.14 --> 849.26]  well, here,
[849.34 --> 850.54]  Jesus is sending us out again.
[850.92 --> 851.58]  Oh, no.
[852.24 --> 852.46]  Right?
[852.60 --> 852.84]  And now,
[852.90 --> 854.70]  confronted with evil again.
[855.00 --> 855.90]  And is evil going to now
[855.90 --> 857.38]  kick our butts again this time?
[859.04 --> 859.44]  No.
[860.00 --> 860.40]  No,
[860.50 --> 861.28]  they're thrilled.
[861.36 --> 861.86]  And I get it.
[862.02 --> 863.58]  Now they did it in Jesus' name.
[863.58 --> 865.36]  And this causes them great joy
[865.36 --> 866.86]  as is understandable.
[867.24 --> 869.14]  And Jesus' response is warm,
[869.26 --> 870.00]  it's affirming,
[870.34 --> 871.60]  even sharing their joy,
[871.94 --> 873.50]  even if that joy
[873.50 --> 875.46]  is somewhat misplaced.
[877.32 --> 878.24]  And before our Lord
[878.24 --> 881.08]  seeks to refocus their joy,
[881.48 --> 882.46]  He informs them
[882.46 --> 883.78]  that their ability
[883.78 --> 884.80]  to cast out demons
[884.80 --> 887.22]  was evidence of a greater matter
[887.22 --> 888.44]  than they imagined.
[889.28 --> 891.78]  He brings them back to mission,
[892.00 --> 893.24]  the ultimate mission.
[893.58 --> 894.12]  What is that?
[894.66 --> 895.36]  He says,
[895.36 --> 897.76]  I saw Satan fall from heaven.
[899.34 --> 900.10]  Yeah, Satan was in heaven
[900.10 --> 900.64]  at one time.
[902.38 --> 904.52]  Jesus has overcome
[904.52 --> 906.36]  through the cross
[906.36 --> 907.80]  to defeat evil,
[907.98 --> 908.90]  to defeat sin,
[909.28 --> 911.70]  to defeat Satan forever.
[913.08 --> 915.22]  The 72 had a skirmish.
[915.96 --> 917.64]  Jesus had come to win the war.
[917.64 --> 921.56]  The mission is salvation.
[923.06 --> 923.60]  You found,
[924.12 --> 924.78]  Jesus is saying,
[924.86 --> 926.32]  you found joy in this moment.
[926.40 --> 927.06]  Well, that's good.
[927.28 --> 929.18]  But you want to go deeper than that.
[929.42 --> 931.00]  You want forever joy.
[931.56 --> 932.48]  Then don't rejoice
[932.48 --> 933.54]  about that demon thing.
[933.90 --> 935.46]  Rejoice that your names
[935.46 --> 936.90]  are written in heaven.
[936.90 --> 942.20]  When was the last time
[942.20 --> 943.32]  you rejoiced in that?
[945.92 --> 950.08]  Your names are written in heaven.
[952.58 --> 954.12]  Does that get your heart pumping?
[954.12 --> 958.68]  Does that change the way you live?
[958.68 --> 961.68]  Your names are written
[961.68 --> 963.12]  in the book of life.
[967.34 --> 968.96]  We shouldn't lose sight of that.
[969.64 --> 972.08]  Even casting out a demon
[972.08 --> 973.48]  isn't proof of one's salvation.
[973.60 --> 974.50]  Look at Matthew 7.
[975.76 --> 976.38]  Jesus said,
[976.38 --> 978.24]  many will say to me
[978.24 --> 979.02]  on that day,
[979.18 --> 979.38]  right,
[979.46 --> 979.86]  at the end of times,
[980.12 --> 980.66]  Lord, Lord,
[980.92 --> 983.10]  we did not prophesy
[983.10 --> 983.62]  in your name.
[984.16 --> 985.32]  Did we not prophesy
[985.32 --> 986.02]  in your name
[986.02 --> 986.86]  and in your name
[986.86 --> 987.94]  drive out demons
[987.94 --> 988.60]  and in your name
[988.60 --> 989.60]  perform many miracles?
[990.02 --> 991.00]  And Jesus said
[991.00 --> 992.04]  to them plainly,
[992.62 --> 993.52]  I never knew you.
[993.62 --> 994.18]  Away with you,
[994.26 --> 994.70]  evildoers.
[997.60 --> 998.38]  So apparently,
[999.38 --> 1001.42]  this isn't an exact
[1001.42 --> 1002.76]  proof
[1002.76 --> 1005.42]  of where their allegiance lies.
[1006.38 --> 1009.24]  I don't quite understand that.
[1010.60 --> 1011.82]  But it's what it says.
[1013.52 --> 1015.14]  It would be easy
[1015.14 --> 1017.42]  to get caught up in power.
[1022.26 --> 1023.66]  The church has been guilty
[1023.66 --> 1024.92]  of that throughout history.
[1025.86 --> 1027.38]  Getting caught up in politics.
[1027.60 --> 1028.84]  Getting caught up in power.
[1029.74 --> 1031.22]  Getting caught up in the human thing.
[1031.70 --> 1032.26]  And forgetting
[1032.26 --> 1033.90]  what is the biggest point.
[1034.24 --> 1036.02]  Your names are written
[1036.02 --> 1037.06]  in heaven.
[1039.06 --> 1041.32]  Jesus saved you.
[1041.98 --> 1042.50]  Why?
[1042.84 --> 1045.06]  Because you needed saving.
[1049.84 --> 1050.70]  Instead of,
[1051.12 --> 1051.84]  look what I can do.
[1051.92 --> 1053.26]  Look what we can do.
[1055.44 --> 1057.26]  And then you forget
[1057.26 --> 1058.30]  about your need
[1058.30 --> 1059.44]  for salvation through Jesus.
[1059.68 --> 1060.54]  And God's grace
[1060.54 --> 1061.48]  ought to be
[1061.48 --> 1062.96]  your greatest joy.
[1064.58 --> 1065.46]  Your name
[1065.46 --> 1066.34]  is written in heaven
[1066.34 --> 1067.72]  because of Jesus.
[1068.74 --> 1069.84]  Rejoice in that.
[1070.16 --> 1071.36]  Stay focused on that
[1071.36 --> 1072.56]  and then share that.
[1074.24 --> 1074.44]  You know,
[1074.48 --> 1075.44]  I've seen churches
[1075.44 --> 1077.80]  that have had huge fights
[1077.80 --> 1078.40]  over what color
[1078.40 --> 1079.34]  the carpet should be.
[1079.34 --> 1082.30]  I remember growing up
[1082.30 --> 1083.34]  in the church
[1083.34 --> 1083.90]  I grew up in
[1083.90 --> 1085.36]  and there was a big fight
[1085.36 --> 1087.18]  about a pipe organ
[1087.18 --> 1090.40]  and who got to play it.
[1092.00 --> 1092.44]  And suddenly
[1092.44 --> 1093.50]  it was more about ego
[1093.50 --> 1094.80]  than it was about worship.
[1096.38 --> 1097.20]  Or having arguments
[1097.20 --> 1097.88]  in another church
[1097.88 --> 1098.44]  where I was at
[1098.44 --> 1100.22]  about what style of music.
[1100.70 --> 1101.92]  Or can you have drums?
[1102.04 --> 1103.42]  Or whatever it might be.
[1103.84 --> 1104.12]  And you know,
[1104.26 --> 1105.38]  and you have big fights
[1105.38 --> 1106.00]  over stuff
[1106.00 --> 1106.94]  and the focus
[1106.94 --> 1108.22]  isn't Jesus anymore.
[1108.40 --> 1108.84]  It isn't.
[1109.00 --> 1109.64]  It's our egos.
[1113.00 --> 1114.06]  I've seen pastors
[1114.06 --> 1115.58]  and every pastor
[1115.58 --> 1116.18]  who has to fight it
[1116.18 --> 1117.78]  has to keep their ego
[1117.78 --> 1119.08]  out of the way.
[1119.44 --> 1120.34]  I've seen Christians
[1120.34 --> 1120.98]  who supposedly
[1120.98 --> 1121.62]  love each other
[1121.62 --> 1122.96]  fight in ugly ways
[1122.96 --> 1123.64]  over issues.
[1124.66 --> 1125.14]  Forgetting
[1125.14 --> 1126.56]  their names
[1126.56 --> 1127.24]  and the names
[1127.24 --> 1127.68]  of the ones
[1127.68 --> 1128.72]  they're hating on
[1128.72 --> 1131.04]  are written
[1131.04 --> 1131.90]  in heaven.
[1133.08 --> 1133.94]  Like your brothers
[1133.94 --> 1134.52]  and sisters
[1134.52 --> 1135.94]  in the saving grace
[1135.94 --> 1136.70]  of Christ.
[1138.12 --> 1138.32]  Yeah,
[1138.40 --> 1139.26]  sometimes we'll disagree.
[1143.54 --> 1144.92]  This thought,
[1145.20 --> 1145.76]  and I think that's
[1145.76 --> 1146.38]  what Jesus was doing
[1146.38 --> 1147.02]  with the disciples here.
[1147.34 --> 1148.76]  This ought to keep us
[1148.76 --> 1149.18]  humble
[1149.18 --> 1150.72]  and properly focused.
[1151.36 --> 1152.82]  Our forever relationship
[1152.82 --> 1153.48]  with God
[1153.48 --> 1154.54]  is our source
[1154.54 --> 1155.58]  of true joy.
[1156.06 --> 1156.40]  That's why
[1156.40 --> 1157.44]  in Hebrews it says,
[1157.54 --> 1158.86]  keep your eyes
[1158.86 --> 1159.92]  on Jesus.
[1160.18 --> 1161.08]  Not on all these
[1161.08 --> 1161.56]  other things.
[1161.84 --> 1162.48]  Keep your eyes
[1162.48 --> 1162.90]  on Him.
[1162.90 --> 1167.36]  for the joy
[1167.36 --> 1168.14]  set before Him
[1168.14 --> 1168.94]  Jesus endured
[1168.94 --> 1169.58]  the cross.
[1169.90 --> 1170.88]  Think about that.
[1173.36 --> 1174.72]  Saving you
[1174.72 --> 1177.40]  brought Jesus
[1177.40 --> 1178.96]  great joy.
[1180.84 --> 1181.82]  So much so
[1181.82 --> 1182.68]  that He was willing
[1182.68 --> 1183.56]  to and had to
[1183.56 --> 1184.80]  take the cross.
[1184.80 --> 1189.98]  sometimes I think
[1189.98 --> 1190.40]  about that,
[1190.46 --> 1190.56]  right?
[1190.64 --> 1190.80]  You know,
[1191.50 --> 1192.38]  if you fell
[1192.38 --> 1193.06]  into the river
[1193.06 --> 1194.90]  and you were drowning
[1194.90 --> 1195.92]  some guy jumped in
[1195.92 --> 1196.80]  and hauled you out,
[1197.18 --> 1198.70]  you'd be so grateful.
[1199.44 --> 1200.06]  Rightly so.
[1200.86 --> 1201.90]  How grateful
[1201.90 --> 1203.06]  are you to Jesus
[1203.06 --> 1204.62]  for saving you
[1204.62 --> 1205.56]  because it brought
[1205.56 --> 1206.76]  Him such joy
[1206.76 --> 1207.54]  to do it?
[1207.54 --> 1212.72]  We ought to wake up
[1212.72 --> 1213.12]  every morning
[1213.12 --> 1213.62]  with a smile
[1213.62 --> 1214.18]  on our face
[1214.18 --> 1215.82]  that we're loved
[1215.82 --> 1216.38]  that much.
[1217.84 --> 1218.78]  Your name
[1218.78 --> 1219.54]  is written
[1219.54 --> 1221.26]  because Jesus
[1221.26 --> 1222.48]  died for you.
[1223.16 --> 1223.30]  You know,
[1223.38 --> 1223.98]  and I was looking
[1223.98 --> 1225.72]  at that phrase,
[1225.84 --> 1226.70]  your name's written,
[1227.20 --> 1228.10]  in a number of places.
[1228.42 --> 1229.26]  There's a lot of places
[1229.26 --> 1229.66]  in Scripture.
[1230.06 --> 1230.96]  Daniel 12,
[1231.08 --> 1231.66]  it says this,
[1232.10 --> 1232.96]  at that time Michael,
[1233.32 --> 1234.60]  the angel,
[1235.12 --> 1235.88]  the great prince
[1235.88 --> 1236.92]  who protects your people
[1236.92 --> 1237.58]  will arise.
[1237.64 --> 1238.92]  This is Old Testament Daniel.
[1239.48 --> 1240.22]  There will be a time
[1240.22 --> 1240.68]  of distress
[1240.68 --> 1241.78]  such as not happened
[1241.78 --> 1242.40]  from the beginning
[1242.40 --> 1243.44]  of the nations
[1243.44 --> 1244.04]  until then.
[1244.36 --> 1245.20]  But at that time
[1245.20 --> 1245.78]  your people,
[1246.00 --> 1247.14]  everyone whose name
[1247.14 --> 1248.14]  found written in the book
[1248.14 --> 1249.14]  will be delivered.
[1249.42 --> 1250.38]  And you have that picture
[1250.38 --> 1252.02]  of what is to come.
[1253.80 --> 1254.10]  Right?
[1254.60 --> 1256.10]  We read in Philippians 4,
[1256.56 --> 1257.76]  I like this one
[1257.76 --> 1258.90]  because Paul's talking
[1258.90 --> 1260.74]  to ordinary people
[1260.74 --> 1262.10]  doing ordinary things
[1262.10 --> 1263.66]  in the church.
[1263.98 --> 1264.26]  And he said,
[1264.32 --> 1265.54]  I plead with Judea
[1265.54 --> 1266.76]  and I plead with,
[1266.76 --> 1267.40]  and I can't say
[1267.40 --> 1267.84]  this name,
[1267.96 --> 1268.34]  Cynthia,
[1268.98 --> 1270.42]  to be of the same
[1270.42 --> 1271.12]  mind of the Lord.
[1271.22 --> 1272.44]  So I guess there was
[1272.44 --> 1273.22]  some kind of disagreement,
[1273.40 --> 1273.58]  right?
[1273.94 --> 1274.70]  Okay, it happens.
[1275.54 --> 1276.66]  Yes, and I ask you,
[1276.74 --> 1277.68]  my true companion,
[1278.08 --> 1278.96]  help these women
[1278.96 --> 1280.06]  since they have contended
[1280.06 --> 1280.76]  at my side
[1280.76 --> 1282.18]  in the cause of the gospel.
[1282.28 --> 1282.74]  They haven't forgotten
[1282.74 --> 1283.10]  the mission.
[1283.44 --> 1284.28]  Along with Clement
[1284.28 --> 1285.86]  and the rest of my coworkers
[1285.86 --> 1287.40]  whose names
[1287.40 --> 1288.86]  are in the book of life.
[1288.86 --> 1293.64]  And next time you have
[1293.64 --> 1294.54]  an argument with someone
[1294.54 --> 1296.26]  particularly in the church context,
[1296.58 --> 1297.56]  remind yourself
[1297.56 --> 1299.44]  that person's name
[1299.44 --> 1300.22]  is written
[1300.22 --> 1301.22]  in the book of life
[1301.22 --> 1302.70]  as is yours.
[1306.86 --> 1307.70]  And then maybe
[1307.70 --> 1308.48]  it'll shut you up
[1308.48 --> 1309.06]  once in a while.
[1312.48 --> 1313.12]  Or at least
[1313.12 --> 1314.04]  keep you focused
[1314.04 --> 1315.04]  on the mission.
[1315.26 --> 1315.64]  What's the mission?
[1316.02 --> 1316.46]  Salvation.
[1321.88 --> 1323.54]  When we look at that passage,
[1323.68 --> 1324.28]  verse 21,
[1324.72 --> 1325.50]  let me read it to you
[1325.50 --> 1326.06]  one more time.
[1326.46 --> 1327.16]  At that time,
[1327.28 --> 1327.82]  here we go.
[1328.12 --> 1328.40]  Jesus,
[1328.70 --> 1330.02]  full of joy
[1330.02 --> 1331.24]  through the Holy Spirit,
[1331.32 --> 1331.44]  said,
[1331.54 --> 1332.50]  I praise you, Father,
[1332.60 --> 1333.32]  Lord of heaven and earth,
[1333.48 --> 1334.38]  because you have hidden
[1334.38 --> 1334.92]  these things
[1334.92 --> 1335.84]  from the wise and the learned
[1335.84 --> 1336.78]  and revealed them
[1336.78 --> 1337.38]  to those children.
[1337.68 --> 1338.20]  Yes, Father,
[1338.28 --> 1338.84]  for this is what
[1338.84 --> 1340.34]  you were pleased to do.
[1341.26 --> 1342.28]  It's the Father's
[1342.28 --> 1343.04]  good pleasure
[1343.04 --> 1344.06]  to accomplish
[1344.06 --> 1345.34]  his salvation plan
[1345.34 --> 1346.44]  through his Son.
[1346.86 --> 1348.06]  The Son makes known
[1348.06 --> 1349.12]  the Father to men.
[1350.28 --> 1351.22]  That's why Jesus says
[1351.22 --> 1352.10]  in Scripture, right,
[1352.22 --> 1353.08]  I am the way,
[1353.32 --> 1353.74]  the truth,
[1353.84 --> 1354.14]  the life.
[1354.40 --> 1355.76]  No one comes to the Father
[1355.76 --> 1357.68]  except through me.
[1361.40 --> 1362.36]  That's the path.
[1365.62 --> 1367.32]  And isn't it incredible
[1367.32 --> 1369.16]  that Jesus and the Father
[1369.16 --> 1370.08]  share joy
[1370.08 --> 1371.58]  in saving us?
[1371.58 --> 1374.44]  it's not just,
[1374.56 --> 1374.96]  okay,
[1375.06 --> 1375.80]  I guess somebody's
[1375.80 --> 1376.62]  got to save him.
[1379.08 --> 1379.42]  No,
[1379.52 --> 1382.38]  it's the whole point.
[1382.38 --> 1382.40]  It's the whole point.
[1389.30 --> 1391.22]  Jesus finds joy
[1391.22 --> 1392.32]  in pleasing the Father,
[1393.06 --> 1393.68]  in living out
[1393.68 --> 1394.88]  his good and perfect will,
[1395.50 --> 1396.22]  in carrying out
[1396.22 --> 1396.66]  the mission
[1396.66 --> 1397.60]  to save men
[1397.60 --> 1398.76]  through himself.
[1398.76 --> 1400.36]  That's why we read,
[1400.44 --> 1401.58]  for God so loved the world
[1401.58 --> 1402.26]  that he gave
[1402.26 --> 1403.02]  his only Son.
[1403.82 --> 1404.54]  The disciples
[1404.54 --> 1405.32]  were to find
[1405.32 --> 1406.50]  their ultimate joy
[1406.50 --> 1408.62]  in God's plan
[1408.62 --> 1409.20]  and will.
[1414.86 --> 1415.70]  And they are,
[1415.76 --> 1416.98]  and they are with Jesus,
[1417.14 --> 1417.28]  right?
[1417.66 --> 1418.50]  I have some picture,
[1418.74 --> 1419.62]  envy them in that.
[1419.94 --> 1420.58]  They are with Jesus
[1420.58 --> 1421.08]  physically,
[1421.58 --> 1422.14]  the Son,
[1422.24 --> 1422.64]  the Messiah,
[1422.86 --> 1423.90]  who sends them out
[1423.90 --> 1424.54]  two by two
[1424.54 --> 1425.82]  with nothing but himself
[1425.82 --> 1426.56]  and his power.
[1427.16 --> 1428.58]  And many wise
[1428.58 --> 1429.50]  and learned ones
[1429.50 --> 1430.36]  can't see this.
[1430.44 --> 1431.48]  And it's not a knock
[1431.48 --> 1432.04]  on education
[1432.04 --> 1432.74]  or anything like that.
[1433.00 --> 1433.80]  What this is a knock
[1433.80 --> 1434.86]  on that passage,
[1435.28 --> 1436.04]  the wise and learned,
[1436.46 --> 1437.60]  is they can't see
[1437.60 --> 1438.70]  their need
[1438.70 --> 1439.60]  to be saved
[1439.60 --> 1440.82]  because they're too busy
[1440.82 --> 1442.38]  saving themselves.
[1444.14 --> 1444.80]  That's what it's
[1444.80 --> 1445.36]  talking about.
[1446.50 --> 1447.60]  I run the show,
[1448.96 --> 1449.56]  and salvation
[1449.56 --> 1450.78]  is about you surrendering.
[1450.78 --> 1454.64]  Not on your own terms.
[1455.24 --> 1456.36]  Keep your eyes
[1456.36 --> 1456.78]  on Jesus
[1456.78 --> 1457.48]  and his salvation,
[1457.74 --> 1458.38]  and then live out
[1458.38 --> 1459.62]  the call on your life.
[1460.32 --> 1461.52]  As you parent,
[1461.78 --> 1462.46]  keep that in mind.
[1462.62 --> 1463.72]  As you are at work,
[1463.80 --> 1464.44]  as you relate
[1464.44 --> 1465.10]  with one another,
[1465.46 --> 1466.76]  as you remember
[1466.76 --> 1468.86]  that you need each other
[1468.86 --> 1470.14]  to keep focused
[1470.14 --> 1470.76]  on the mission
[1470.76 --> 1472.04]  and on Jesus'
[1472.20 --> 1472.82]  saving power.
[1473.22 --> 1473.94]  Our joy
[1473.94 --> 1475.04]  is being subject
[1475.04 --> 1475.88]  to Jesus,
[1476.20 --> 1476.88]  to his will,
[1477.04 --> 1477.90]  to his control.
[1478.12 --> 1479.20]  That goes against
[1479.20 --> 1481.24]  our own sinful nature.
[1481.60 --> 1483.42]  We don't like surrender.
[1486.78 --> 1487.94]  That's the only path.
[1489.38 --> 1491.10]  That's when Paul writes too,
[1491.18 --> 1492.66]  he wrote in Philippians,
[1492.76 --> 1494.00]  being confident in this,
[1494.08 --> 1494.74]  that he who began
[1494.74 --> 1495.30]  a good work in you
[1495.30 --> 1496.08]  will complete it.
[1497.74 --> 1498.00]  Right?
[1501.40 --> 1502.26]  God finishes
[1502.26 --> 1502.84]  what he starts.
[1503.46 --> 1504.80]  He chose you and I
[1504.80 --> 1505.74]  long before we ever
[1505.74 --> 1506.38]  chose him.
[1507.74 --> 1509.18]  Bring himself
[1509.18 --> 1510.38]  salvation through the cross
[1510.38 --> 1512.12]  and it is through Jesus
[1512.12 --> 1513.08]  that salvation
[1513.08 --> 1515.30]  will be completed.
[1516.72 --> 1517.72]  Because sometimes,
[1518.00 --> 1519.18]  maybe you're the same way,
[1519.62 --> 1521.04]  sometimes I'm not feeling it.
[1525.28 --> 1526.36]  Yet I need to live
[1526.36 --> 1527.36]  in the truth of it.
[1528.62 --> 1529.60]  I can't always trust
[1529.60 --> 1530.28]  the way I feel.
[1532.92 --> 1533.32]  Right?
[1534.08 --> 1535.16]  Sometimes I need to say
[1535.16 --> 1536.06]  I trust God
[1536.06 --> 1536.88]  in spite of,
[1536.88 --> 1537.64]  and maybe you do
[1537.64 --> 1538.64]  in spite of this,
[1538.74 --> 1539.34]  in spite of that,
[1539.60 --> 1540.60]  in spite of the circumstance,
[1540.90 --> 1541.28]  in spite of,
[1541.34 --> 1541.74]  in spite of,
[1541.76 --> 1542.28]  in spite of.
[1543.50 --> 1544.28]  So whatever
[1544.28 --> 1545.18]  distracts you,
[1545.28 --> 1545.72]  and there's plenty
[1545.72 --> 1546.50]  to distract,
[1547.88 --> 1548.68]  keep your eyes
[1548.68 --> 1549.46]  focused on Jesus.
[1549.84 --> 1550.82]  In the midst of suffering,
[1550.94 --> 1551.06]  yeah.
[1551.66 --> 1552.06]  Addiction,
[1552.20 --> 1552.34]  yeah.
[1552.54 --> 1552.86]  Ego,
[1553.16 --> 1553.46]  fear,
[1553.68 --> 1554.10]  anxiety,
[1554.50 --> 1554.94]  problems,
[1555.12 --> 1555.50]  issues,
[1555.70 --> 1555.98]  sin,
[1556.80 --> 1557.70]  casting out demons.
[1558.10 --> 1559.32]  Let your focus
[1559.32 --> 1560.58]  always be
[1560.58 --> 1561.22]  Jesus.
[1561.22 --> 1561.34]  Jesus.
[1564.44 --> 1565.20]  I thought I'd
[1565.20 --> 1566.54]  kind of conclude
[1566.54 --> 1569.08]  with a passage
[1569.08 --> 1570.52]  out of Psalm 51
[1570.52 --> 1571.14]  since I was reading
[1571.14 --> 1571.96]  the Psalms this summer.
[1573.64 --> 1575.36]  And King David,
[1576.02 --> 1576.30]  right,
[1576.66 --> 1577.68]  Scripture describes him
[1577.68 --> 1579.12]  as a man after God's own heart.
[1579.84 --> 1580.88]  What a wonderful thing
[1580.88 --> 1582.36]  that's said of you.
[1583.44 --> 1583.72]  And yet,
[1583.84 --> 1584.48]  here he is,
[1585.38 --> 1585.58]  caught,
[1585.74 --> 1585.92]  you know,
[1585.98 --> 1587.08]  he committed adultery,
[1587.08 --> 1588.74]  and he murdered
[1588.74 --> 1590.02]  somebody there
[1590.02 --> 1591.22]  in that process.
[1591.98 --> 1592.86]  And he writes this,
[1592.90 --> 1593.64]  and look at it with me.
[1594.64 --> 1595.54]  See where his eyes
[1595.54 --> 1595.98]  are focused.
[1596.50 --> 1597.64]  Have mercy on me,
[1597.68 --> 1598.06]  O God,
[1598.12 --> 1598.70]  according to your
[1598.70 --> 1599.52]  unfailing love,
[1599.76 --> 1600.42]  according to your
[1600.42 --> 1601.16]  great compassion.
[1601.52 --> 1602.88]  Blot out my transgressions.
[1603.14 --> 1604.42]  Wash away all my iniquity.
[1604.78 --> 1606.10]  Cleanse me from my sin.
[1606.44 --> 1607.54]  Cleanse me with hyssop
[1607.54 --> 1608.74]  and I will be clean.
[1609.06 --> 1609.54]  Wash me
[1609.54 --> 1610.86]  and I'll be whiter than snow.
[1611.32 --> 1612.22]  And here's the joy thing.
[1612.48 --> 1614.58]  Let me hear joy and gladness.
[1614.82 --> 1615.66]  Let the bones
[1615.66 --> 1616.52]  you have crushed
[1616.52 --> 1617.06]  rejoice.
[1617.72 --> 1618.54]  Hide your face
[1618.54 --> 1619.30]  from my sins
[1619.30 --> 1620.62]  and blot out all my iniquity.
[1621.36 --> 1622.06]  Create in me
[1622.06 --> 1622.64]  a pure heart,
[1622.72 --> 1623.08]  O God.
[1624.00 --> 1625.48]  Renew a steadfast spirit
[1625.48 --> 1626.02]  within me.
[1626.62 --> 1627.64]  Don't cast me
[1627.64 --> 1628.84]  from your presence
[1628.84 --> 1629.64]  or take your spirit
[1629.64 --> 1630.24]  from me.
[1630.86 --> 1631.36]  And then this,
[1632.26 --> 1633.38]  restore to me
[1633.38 --> 1635.78]  the joy of your salvation.
[1638.70 --> 1639.66]  Even in spite
[1639.66 --> 1641.48]  of those horrific failures
[1641.48 --> 1642.16]  David had,
[1643.26 --> 1643.92]  his joy
[1643.92 --> 1645.06]  is found
[1645.06 --> 1646.36]  in his salvation.
[1646.36 --> 1648.24]  in what God
[1648.24 --> 1649.08]  has done.
[1649.42 --> 1650.26]  Our brokenness
[1650.26 --> 1651.28]  can distract us,
[1651.64 --> 1652.52]  change our focus
[1652.52 --> 1653.38]  off of Jesus
[1653.38 --> 1654.48]  onto the problems
[1654.48 --> 1655.22]  that don't save us.
[1655.42 --> 1656.28]  They can rob us
[1656.28 --> 1656.88]  of joy.
[1657.32 --> 1658.34]  We focus on failure.
[1658.54 --> 1659.56]  We focus on guilt.
[1659.82 --> 1660.84]  And in some weird way
[1660.84 --> 1661.96]  it turns us inward
[1661.96 --> 1662.70]  to ourselves.
[1663.04 --> 1663.66]  And suddenly
[1663.66 --> 1664.42]  we're no longer
[1664.42 --> 1665.22]  feeling secure.
[1665.38 --> 1666.02]  Well, no wonder.
[1666.88 --> 1667.56]  And we're like
[1667.56 --> 1669.14]  those disciples
[1669.14 --> 1671.28]  who had cast out demons
[1671.28 --> 1672.34]  and made that the point
[1672.34 --> 1673.10]  and Jesus said,
[1673.20 --> 1674.30]  I don't know you.
[1676.84 --> 1677.84]  I don't know you.
[1677.92 --> 1678.20]  Why?
[1678.62 --> 1679.56]  Because you're not
[1679.56 --> 1680.60]  following me.
[1683.66 --> 1684.64]  You're not following
[1684.64 --> 1685.02]  Jesus,
[1685.16 --> 1685.88]  the one who saw
[1685.88 --> 1687.04]  and caused Satan
[1687.04 --> 1688.24]  to fall.
[1689.40 --> 1690.46]  He gets forgotten
[1690.46 --> 1691.40]  in the process.
[1692.60 --> 1693.42]  Jesus is the only
[1693.42 --> 1694.54]  secure place to be.
[1694.54 --> 1695.60]  The only source
[1695.60 --> 1697.06]  of true joy.
[1698.04 --> 1698.74]  And he says,
[1699.08 --> 1700.86]  bring your faith
[1700.86 --> 1701.30]  in me
[1701.30 --> 1702.70]  and I'll provide
[1702.70 --> 1703.46]  all you need
[1703.46 --> 1705.00]  even in the face
[1705.00 --> 1705.90]  of all the wolves
[1705.90 --> 1706.56]  around you.
[1707.80 --> 1708.36]  And he says,
[1708.44 --> 1709.44]  so little lambs,
[1709.48 --> 1709.94]  how many of you
[1709.94 --> 1710.70]  like being called
[1710.70 --> 1711.30]  little lamb?
[1713.50 --> 1714.22]  Especially some
[1714.22 --> 1714.74]  of you guys.
[1716.50 --> 1716.80]  He says,
[1716.84 --> 1717.62]  little lambs,
[1718.08 --> 1718.70]  you're amongst
[1718.70 --> 1719.20]  the wolves
[1719.20 --> 1719.90]  but you're safe.
[1719.90 --> 1720.12]  Why?
[1720.28 --> 1720.94]  Because I'm with you.
[1722.32 --> 1723.16]  And then together
[1723.16 --> 1724.98]  we as lambs
[1724.98 --> 1725.96]  we go forth
[1725.96 --> 1726.54]  and we proclaim
[1726.54 --> 1727.72]  salvation through Jesus.
[1728.14 --> 1729.30]  But we don't forget
[1729.30 --> 1730.72]  and look at Matthew 9.
[1731.52 --> 1732.24]  When Jesus saw
[1732.24 --> 1732.92]  the crowds,
[1733.38 --> 1734.26]  he had compassion
[1734.26 --> 1734.72]  on them
[1734.72 --> 1735.84]  because they were
[1735.84 --> 1737.46]  harassed and helpless
[1737.46 --> 1738.16]  and here we go,
[1738.48 --> 1739.22]  like sheep
[1739.22 --> 1740.32]  without a shepherd.
[1741.60 --> 1742.30]  And then he said
[1742.30 --> 1742.86]  to his disciples,
[1743.00 --> 1743.66]  and he said it
[1743.66 --> 1744.20]  in this passage
[1744.20 --> 1744.98]  we read out of Luke,
[1745.32 --> 1746.36]  the harvest is plentiful
[1746.36 --> 1747.00]  but the workers
[1747.00 --> 1748.24]  are few.
[1750.04 --> 1751.02]  We lambs
[1751.02 --> 1752.00]  are secure
[1752.00 --> 1752.62]  in Jesus
[1752.62 --> 1754.36]  but there are so many
[1754.36 --> 1755.16]  who are aimless
[1755.16 --> 1756.78]  and helpless lambs
[1756.78 --> 1758.24]  in need of Jesus
[1758.24 --> 1759.04]  the good shepherd.
[1760.00 --> 1761.02]  They need his saving.
[1762.34 --> 1763.34]  And when you come
[1763.34 --> 1764.90]  to a town
[1764.90 --> 1765.38]  or you come
[1765.38 --> 1765.92]  to a people,
[1766.02 --> 1766.68]  when you come
[1766.68 --> 1767.40]  to someone,
[1767.92 --> 1768.14]  yeah,
[1768.90 --> 1769.72]  look for opportunities
[1769.72 --> 1770.34]  to eat with them.
[1771.70 --> 1772.54]  Seek hospitality.
[1772.98 --> 1773.56]  Help those
[1773.56 --> 1774.26]  who are struggling
[1774.26 --> 1776.28]  and say to them,
[1777.18 --> 1778.32]  the kingdom of God
[1778.32 --> 1779.08]  has come near
[1779.08 --> 1780.00]  to you.
[1782.06 --> 1783.52]  And then rejoice.
[1783.84 --> 1784.42]  Rejoice in what?
[1784.76 --> 1785.54]  Rejoice because
[1785.54 --> 1786.82]  Jesus has saved you
[1786.82 --> 1788.16]  and he has saved us
[1788.16 --> 1789.30]  and in that
[1789.30 --> 1790.26]  we are sent out
[1790.26 --> 1791.56]  in his mighty name
[1791.56 --> 1793.64]  to find those lambs
[1793.64 --> 1795.56]  who are running aimless
[1795.56 --> 1796.46]  and without a shepherd.
[1796.46 --> 1796.56]  Lord,
[1797.10 --> 1798.16]  let's pray.
[1801.26 --> 1802.04]  Lord God,
[1802.10 --> 1803.02]  we thank you so much
[1803.02 --> 1805.00]  for calling us,
[1806.00 --> 1808.20]  calling us
[1808.20 --> 1808.84]  to be part
[1808.84 --> 1809.78]  of your mission.
[1811.10 --> 1811.62]  Lord,
[1811.70 --> 1812.20]  might we
[1812.20 --> 1813.94]  keep our focus
[1813.94 --> 1814.48]  on you
[1814.48 --> 1815.16]  and you alone.
[1815.84 --> 1816.50]  Might we find
[1816.50 --> 1817.32]  great joy
[1817.32 --> 1818.08]  in the knowledge
[1818.08 --> 1819.08]  that you love us,
[1819.44 --> 1820.48]  that you saved us
[1820.48 --> 1821.94]  and then invite others
[1821.94 --> 1823.20]  into that beauty
[1823.20 --> 1823.64]  as well.
[1824.64 --> 1825.26]  We pray,
[1825.44 --> 1825.82]  Lord,
[1825.94 --> 1826.46]  for those
[1826.46 --> 1827.28]  who we know
[1827.28 --> 1828.80]  who don't know you.
[1829.84 --> 1830.50]  We pray that
[1830.50 --> 1831.28]  you might open
[1831.28 --> 1831.82]  some doors
[1831.82 --> 1832.54]  so that we might
[1832.54 --> 1833.48]  touch their lives.
[1833.88 --> 1834.60]  We pray that
[1834.60 --> 1835.14]  this church
[1835.14 --> 1835.86]  will be a place
[1835.86 --> 1837.08]  that welcomes
[1837.08 --> 1838.28]  and is open
[1838.28 --> 1838.82]  to those
[1838.82 --> 1839.48]  who are searching,
[1839.78 --> 1840.62]  who are running aimless
[1840.62 --> 1841.76]  and that they might
[1841.76 --> 1842.90]  find you.
[1843.66 --> 1844.36]  Lord Jesus,
[1844.52 --> 1845.18]  we thank you
[1845.18 --> 1845.94]  that you have
[1845.94 --> 1846.70]  overcome Satan
[1846.70 --> 1848.60]  and that you invite us
[1848.60 --> 1849.84]  into the battle
[1849.84 --> 1851.44]  but knowing full well
[1851.44 --> 1852.46]  that you have won the war
[1852.46 --> 1853.60]  in Jesus' name.
[1853.64 --> 1854.28]  Amen.
