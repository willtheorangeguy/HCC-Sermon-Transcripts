[0.00 → 7.00] last year
[20.24 → 23.64] so this interview came about our surge group from last year
[23.64 → 27.80] the discipleship group we had a reunion just to hear jams and Sarah's story
[27.80 → 31.40] over the last year and then as they were sharing I'm like would you be willing to
[31.40 → 36.92] share this with our church, and they very kindly obliged and so before we get into
[36.92 → 40.24] your story just maybe for those who don't know who you are said a few words
[40.24 → 43.04] about who you are and how you came to hope
[43.04 → 47.32] good morning my name is jams and this is my wife Sarah
[47.32 → 52.60] we're both from Korea first came as an international student I came in the year
[52.60 → 61.72] 2000, and she came in here 2007 we met in bless you, and we met in year 2012 and
[61.72 → 67.48] married in 2013 with the two girls nine and who's for nine and five years old
[67.48 → 75.80] and I work at a CRA and Sarah is an early childhood educator, but she's
[75.80 → 80.84] taking time off because of her health, and we found hope community church in early
[80.84 → 88.04] 2021 before that before then we where we lived in Korea for four years
[88.04 → 93.08] well Sarah why don't you share a little bit about your journey over the last year
[93.56 → 99.56] so I actually prepared in advance so I will just look through
[99.56 → 105.72] so last year I went my kids and I went to Korea to visit my family
[105.72 → 111.40] and my brother's family too for the during the spring break
[113.40 → 119.08] and like many Koreans do I also took the opportunity to get a health checkup
[119.08 → 121.72] and two days before returning to Canada
[127.00 → 133.24] ah returning to two days before returning to Canada I received a
[133.24 → 140.04] research via email the doctor mentioned some concerns about my breast and recommended a tissue
[140.04 → 146.84] examination and the research would be available in a few days we returned to Canada as planned
[146.84 → 153.88] and a few days later I got a call from my dad in Korea saying that the research show
[153.88 → 161.74] was found that the earlier schedule helped me already Anatomy religion has refined jug
[161.74 → 164.36] the finalized wound was LO DNS legally on disease and which was sequent
[164.36 → 168.20] you know 38% of racism and the medicine was founded as an engineering and face
[168.20 → 170.36] or digital we headed to name one company that I found a 하나� yeah
[170.36 → 172.52] and we really moved on to FIRM by dad in the spring berries
[172.52 → 172.56] who was not Finally did I will believe him in km
[172.56 → 173.36] and then the fact of Eurasia and our Noise
[173.36 → 175.52] is the team was 20 years old who had been distributed over the years
[175.52 → 177.08] because it was pretty crazy it's so uh they've had professors
[177.08 → 178.20] predestamentos, but they were being talking on health concerns about not knowing when I was
[178.20 → 184.92] there's a lot you could share about the experience of treatment, but I'd love for
[184.92 → 189.36] you to talk a little bit about what God showed you and the ways that God taught
[189.36 → 195.30] you individually and as a couple through this experience of cancer after finding
[195.30 → 202.74] out about my cancer my first thoughts were did I do something wrong and am I
[202.74 → 208.32] getting punished for some mistakes even though I've been going to church all my
[208.32 → 216.18] life and thought of myself a faithful believer God was someone I feared for
[216.18 → 221.56] someone like me who didn't know much about God during the tough times
[221.56 → 230.50] of my illness God taught me the most about who God is
[230.50 → 237.88] so the first Sunday in Korea was Easter Sunday and for the first time the
[237.88 → 243.76] sermon about the cross and Jesus love which I had heard many times before feel
[243.76 → 248.86] like a personal message from God Jesus Christ's suffering and death on the cross
[248.86 → 255.34] was God's plan to complete his promise and showing his love for us with this
[255.34 → 262.36] revelation my worries turn into gratitude and tears kept flowing after that
[262.36 → 268.54] gosh consistently showed me his character during my treatment making me
[268.54 → 275.66] understand that it was part of his plan to cultivate complete trust in him whenever
[275.66 → 281.72] I went to see the doctor I didn't hear good news, and I was discouraged it because I
[281.72 → 287.06] had to start unexpected chemotherapy and the situation wasn't great as my type of
[287.06 → 294.02] cancer was uncommon since prayer was the only thing I could do I prayed with my
[294.02 → 300.32] parents asking for peace rely on relying solely on the sovereign God and
[300.32 → 306.38] deciding to be thankful in all things even though I felt a bit better before
[306.38 → 313.64] starting chemo the fear stealing lingered I pray for God be with me every moment of
[313.64 → 320.00] this tough journey and provide the strength to endure my body which had no pain
[320.00 → 328.04] before underwent a drastic change with just one round of chemo my face turned pale I
[328.04 → 335.72] felt a draining sensation in all my muscles and making it hard to see it thankfully there was a
[335.72 → 344.00] place in Korea to help with post-cancer treatment care, so my mom called them got permission for
[344.00 → 351.32] admission on the same day and with their help I gradually recovered and on that night my mom
[351.32 → 360.62] praised God for finding a facility that could help us honestly I couldn't understand why she was thankful as I was
[360.62 → 378.62] still struggling and feeling like I was almost dying I prayed to God if chemo is like this I can't do it anymore I can go I cannot go through the remaining seven round of rounds
[378.62 → 386.90], so please perform a miracle and let me stop here about three days later the side effects began to disappear
[386.90 → 400.90] one by one when I was in pain I felt abandoned by God, and I was sad and even a bit angry however as time passed I realized that God never left me alone for a moment
[400.90 → 418.90] and I and I thought we believe in his enduring strength and grace though this is a very personal story I pray to God each time side effects occurred I pray to avoid emergency room visits due to fever
[418.90 → 438.90] or delays in the next chemotherapy session and I pray to keep my hands and feet warm as cancer patients often have cold extremities I seldom pray like this, but I did it because I'm lacking faith in God needed a kind of secret assurance
[438.90 → 457.90] the chemo was fear itself for me and I wanted to feel through such evidence that God was with me throughout the eight rounds of chemo God has answered to all these prayers and each time I praise God in gratitude
[457.90 → 467.70] since most of my life was lived through my parents prayers I didn't have many opportunities for deep fellowship with God
[467.70 → 487.70] however during my busy time of raising children and working as a mom cancer provided me with temporal flexibility it became an opportunity to have fellowship with the Lord I dedicated regular moments of solitude to encounter God
[487.70 → 498.22] God. What changed during that time was that my prayers to God shifted from one-sidedly expressing
[498.22 → 506.28] my desires to seeking and listening to his heart. The time spent with God became more anticipated
[506.28 → 514.76] and enjoyable than any other fellowship. Through fellowship with God, I've come realize how great
[514.76 → 524.62] God's love is, something I hadn't fully understood before. I have gained insights into why God created
[524.62 → 533.42] me, the purpose of my life, and I feel like I've started to understand a little more about God.
[534.36 → 541.44] Now that the long treatment in Korea has ended and concluding with the positive result of being
[541.44 → 550.72] breast cancer-free. However, I don't think that my life will always be filled with positive experiences
[550.72 → 558.46] simply because I've drawn closer to God. There was a time when I lived in constant worry and anxiety,
[558.80 → 565.56] fearing potential hardships for myself and my family. However, I've been free from the fears of
[565.56 → 574.78] this world through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. The reason I am no longer afraid
[574.78 → 583.50] is that the God who was with me during the difficult times always provides me with good things and guides
[583.50 → 585.50] me on the best path.
[585.50 → 602.72] Yeah, we knew that we made the right choice that Sarah is getting treatment in Korea because that's where she can get more support from her parents.
[602.72 → 608.84] And I have my parents live in Burnaby, so I could get the support from my parents as well.
[609.62 → 615.38] So as soon as we made the decision without me having the time to contemplate, we just had to jump in.
[615.50 → 621.66] Our family had to jump in and start the least things we have to do to take care of my daughters.
[621.66 → 626.42] And I took some time off during the summer to visit Sarah.
[627.48 → 638.80] And during that time, God has shown me so much, especially about, like, He personally made me feel His heart and love for us,
[638.96 → 645.62] all of us, not just Christians, Christians, non-Christians, like everybody, and how patient He is,
[645.62 → 651.36] and how much He wants more of us to know Jesus and come back to God.
[651.86 → 654.20] It was just amazing.
[654.20 → 662.80] And I think I now truly understand what it means to be a blessing to our neighbours and communities.
[663.64 → 669.04] And what surprised me more is that when I visited Sarah in summer after three months,
[669.92 → 672.66] God has shown, Sarah has experienced the same God.
[672.66 → 682.06] And we were just full of joy and gratitude, like, sharing about God and worshipping Him.
[682.50 → 685.28] Like, none of our issues were matter anymore.
[685.76 → 691.58] Like, whether we're healthy or finances, like, none mattered because we have Jesus.
[692.18 → 696.34] So that was the most, yeah, amazing part that I experienced.
[696.34 → 703.98] I still remember when we prayed with the surge group in the office over there just before you went to Korea.
[704.78 → 708.08] And just the fears and the anxiety around it and just with your kids.
[708.74 → 713.14] And I can honestly say I didn't know how you'd go through it or how you'd come back.
[713.52 → 716.00] But I can sense that you've changed, both of you.
[716.70 → 720.08] And it's remarkable because there are ways that we can talk, sometimes flippantly,
[720.08 → 724.58] about how God shows up in suffering, about what His plan is in suffering.
[724.68 → 729.32] And then when you came back, I was just hearing a couple that experienced the depth
[729.32 → 732.24] of God's love and His provision in the midst of suffering.
[732.30 → 733.62] And I praise the Lord for that.
[735.22 → 738.90] Maybe one question I'll have, and this is sort of on behalf of our church.
[739.02 → 741.88] There's people in our church going through different forms of suffering,
[742.00 → 743.84] different forms of pain and frustration with the Lord.
[743.84 → 747.82] What would you want to say to people in our church who are going through hardship right now?
[751.98 → 755.82] As the Word of God declares in the book of Isaiah,
[757.30 → 763.74] He is a wonderful counsellor, almighty God, the everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace.
[764.26 → 770.40] I believe that the great and unchanging God is our Father.
[770.40 → 777.84] It would be wonderful if you take any problem to Him, seeking His heart, and listening in prayer.
[778.90 → 785.38] Through these challenges, God desires intimacy with us and longs to receive our hearts.
[786.20 → 794.22] He wants us to entrust everything to Him and experience true freedom within the peace He provides.
[794.22 → 800.80] It will bring us true joy and peace in the midst of our troubles.
[801.72 → 808.34] One more thing I want to share is to always express gratitude for everything God has given you.
[808.90 → 815.36] Even when gratitude seems difficult, and it makes our challenges no longer seem like problems,
[815.90 → 819.70] and praising Him removes sadness, filling us with joy.
[819.70 → 828.74] Living as Christians in this world, the opportunities to grow closer to God seem more like blessings than disasters.
[829.78 → 836.62] The God I have experienced is truly reliable, much greater, and better than I could ever imagine.
[837.82 → 838.10] Amen.
[838.46 → 838.70] Amen.
[839.70 → 842.32] Thank you so much for taking time to share this testimony.
[842.32 → 847.26] You should know that Sarah, well, obviously, you might not know, but Sarah's first language is Korean,
[847.52 → 851.50] and I see Korean written on her sheet, and I know it took a lot of work for you to read it all out in English,
[851.56 → 856.24] and we're very grateful for the way in which you shared with us the testimony of God's faithfulness.
[856.70 → 861.32] I just want to say, too, to the church, this is also on behalf of Sarah, but gratitude.
[861.32 → 870.10] Yeah, I really want to thank you to everyone for all the prayers and support and also the military.
[870.52 → 874.60] It was amazing, and we had a true blessing from you guys.
[874.78 → 875.64] Thank you so much.
[875.64 → 875.70] Thank you.
[875.70 → 890.42] I'd like to spend a few minutes in prayer, thanking the Lord for his provision.
[890.58 → 891.52] Would you join with me in prayer?
[894.14 → 895.14] Father, we praise you.
[895.76 → 899.92] We praise you for being the Lord of life and the healer of bodies.
[900.88 → 904.44] We thank you that Sarah is back home with her family and with us and that she's healthy.
[904.44 → 906.70] We thank you for doctors and nurses.
[907.54 → 909.02] We thank you for cancer treatment.
[909.86 → 912.86] We thank you for the way you use ordinary humans serving with their gifts,
[913.44 → 915.44] such that Sarah could receive this kind of care.
[916.84 → 919.06] Lord, we thank you for the way you meet us in suffering,
[919.22 → 921.66] and I want to pray right now for anyone this morning in our church
[921.66 → 927.82] who is struggling with health and pain and is frustrated with the pain that they carry.
[928.36 → 932.74] We ask that you would meet them and show yourself to be a reliable father
[932.74 → 935.86] the way you showed Sarah and James that you are a reliable father.
[936.84 → 940.60] Meet us in our need and reveal to us the depth of your love.
[940.82 → 942.24] We pray this in your mighty name.
[942.90 → 943.14] Amen.
[944.24 → 945.16] Thank you so much.
[948.48 → 951.34] This time I'm going to invite Sandy Volant to lead us in community prayer.
[951.34 → 966.02] Good morning, Hope Community Church.
[966.34 → 971.86] Thank you so much for your testimony of God's faith and grace,
[972.42 → 976.14] meeting you in your greatest time of need and walking with you.
[976.14 → 978.68] He does not leave us or forsake us.
[979.30 → 983.18] Such an inspirational faith story, and we thank you for that.
[983.98 → 988.90] I don't know about you, but the older I get, the more I feel like I'm running out of time.
[989.94 → 994.20] And time is one of God's greatest gifts to us, I believe.
[994.84 → 997.42] When we're younger, we don't think much about it.
[997.46 → 999.24] We wake up, and we go about our day.
[999.34 → 1002.80] The older you get, the more you think about, hmm, my days are numbered.
[1002.80 → 1008.68] In Scripture, in Psalm 90, verse 12, it says,
[1008.86 → 1012.62] Teach us to number our days, that we may get a heart of wisdom.
[1013.60 → 1018.54] And so it's with that text I would like to anchor my prayer this morning with you.
[1018.60 → 1019.98] Would you pray with me, please?
[1023.62 → 1028.42] Dear Heavenly Father, we come to you on this day of Sabbath,
[1028.42 → 1034.54] a time when you have given us to rest in your word,
[1034.54 → 1036.64] to rest in your presence,
[1036.90 → 1041.22] to escape from our busy schedules of the week,
[1041.60 → 1045.26] and to reserve this time to spend it with you.
[1046.04 → 1051.48] Lord, you knew in your infinite wisdom that we would need this time and this space
[1051.48 → 1054.60] to reset our minds on you.
[1054.98 → 1056.44] There are so many distractions.
[1056.44 → 1060.90] Our time is being coveted by so many things,
[1061.56 → 1064.94] whether it be our family obligations, our work,
[1065.60 → 1068.96] our friendships, our relationships, Lord.
[1069.50 → 1075.70] And sometimes we feel squeezed by all the things that are clamouring for our time.
[1075.92 → 1078.66] We pray, Lord, that we would be able to prioritize.
[1079.96 → 1084.68] Forgive us, Lord, for the time and times when we waste our time,
[1084.68 → 1089.20] when we are lured into the scroll of social media,
[1090.14 → 1092.10] that one more Netflix show,
[1092.64 → 1096.22] or maybe just working another hour.
[1097.02 → 1099.16] Lord, help us to value our time.
[1099.44 → 1102.72] And in those moments when we are mindful, Lord,
[1102.80 → 1104.64] help us to use our time
[1104.64 → 1112.60] and be mindful of the ways in which you would want us to be servants in time.
[1113.40 → 1117.80] Lord, we think especially of those who are suffering now, Lord,
[1117.88 → 1120.58] who are feeling like time is slipping away.
[1121.10 → 1122.72] We want to pray for Marnie.
[1122.72 → 1126.62] We know that she has had suffering.
[1127.24 → 1130.20] And we'd ask, Lord, that the time that you give her, Lord,
[1130.26 → 1131.64] would be meaningful time,
[1132.10 → 1134.58] that she would come to a time of peace.
[1135.14 → 1138.68] For those who are struggling with their elderly parents, Lord,
[1138.88 → 1140.40] time is ticking away.
[1140.52 → 1145.28] For those who are losing their mind to dementia and other ailments, Lord,
[1145.28 → 1147.30] we pray that the time would be precious
[1147.30 → 1149.82] and that we would take those moments
[1149.82 → 1153.28] and not have regret for having squandered our time.
[1153.98 → 1159.36] We thank you for the moments in which you have met James and Sarah
[1159.36 → 1160.60] in their suffering.
[1160.82 → 1166.06] This time has been a time to strip away all the things
[1166.06 → 1168.26] that aren't even important anymore, Lord.
[1168.38 → 1172.90] These times when we come to you in our weakness
[1172.90 → 1176.08] and we realize that we are fallible without you.
[1176.84 → 1179.58] And so those two are times, Lord, in our suffering
[1179.58 → 1183.02] that we know you've carved out for us to go deeper with you.
[1183.60 → 1188.60] And we, in our celebration of Sarah's good health now,
[1189.26 → 1192.72] also celebrate the time in which she was able to grow
[1192.72 → 1194.24] in her faith through this.
[1195.12 → 1197.50] Lord, we pray that we would use our time,
[1197.68 → 1199.76] whether it be to serve in the church, Lord,
[1200.12 → 1201.62] to serve in our community,
[1201.62 → 1203.44] to go into our neighbourhoods
[1203.44 → 1207.94] and to really just commit this valuable resource
[1207.94 → 1210.00] that you've given each one of us, Lord.
[1210.70 → 1214.36] Help us to honour the time that you've given us on earth
[1214.36 → 1217.28] and use it for your glory and your purpose.
[1217.56 → 1218.86] In Jesus' name, amen.
[1218.86 → 1219.06] Amen.
[1219.06 → 1219.12] Amen.
[1231.62 → 1247.56] We're going to continue our sermon series on the book of Galatians.
[1247.56 → 1251.18] Last week, Pastor Sid preached on the gospel
[1251.18 → 1252.70] and the ways that we distort it,
[1252.84 → 1254.38] the ways that we shift it
[1254.38 → 1257.18] to make it no longer good news about Jesus Christ.
[1257.66 → 1259.56] And for the next two weeks, we're looking at how
[1259.56 → 1262.24] or what it means really to be part of God's family.
[1263.10 → 1264.98] And you'll probably notice at different points
[1264.98 → 1266.28] that when you distort the gospel,
[1266.38 → 1268.88] you will also distort what it means to be part of God's family.
[1268.94 → 1270.24] Those things are linked together.
[1270.94 → 1272.82] And this morning, we're going to continue in our study
[1272.82 → 1275.30] of the book of Galatians by reading some of chapter 3.
[1275.30 → 1276.82] And if you have your Bible on your phone
[1276.82 → 1278.78] or the old school physical Bible,
[1278.94 → 1280.90] turn with me to the book of Galatians.
[1281.06 → 1282.88] And we're going to read chapter 3, 1 to 14,
[1283.36 → 1286.34] and then jump over to verse 28 and 29.
[1290.16 → 1292.24] I love how Paul starts this passage.
[1292.90 → 1293.84] Nice and fiery.
[1294.90 → 1299.00] You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you?
[1299.90 → 1303.26] Before your very eyes, Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed
[1303.26 → 1303.90] as crucified.
[1303.90 → 1307.24] I would like to learn just one thing from you.
[1307.94 → 1310.14] Did you receive the Spirit by observing the law
[1310.14 → 1312.46] or by believing what you heard?
[1313.20 → 1314.76] Are you so foolish?
[1315.46 → 1316.90] After beginning with the Spirit,
[1317.00 → 1319.34] are you trying now to finish by human effort?
[1320.24 → 1322.56] Have you experienced so much in vain,
[1322.66 → 1324.20] if it really was in vain?
[1325.06 → 1326.46] Does God give you His Spirit
[1326.46 → 1329.22] and work miracles among you by observing the law
[1329.22 → 1331.70] or by your believing what you heard?
[1331.70 → 1334.56] So also Abraham believed God
[1334.56 → 1336.76] and it was credited to him as righteousness.
[1337.94 → 1340.34] Understand then that those who have faith
[1340.34 → 1341.86] are children of Abraham.
[1342.56 → 1345.24] Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles
[1345.24 → 1349.06] by faith and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham.
[1349.06 → 1351.56] All nations will be blessed through you.
[1352.22 → 1355.68] So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham,
[1356.06 → 1357.04] the man of faith.
[1357.82 → 1360.70] All who rely on observing the law are under a curse,
[1361.10 → 1361.84] for it is written,
[1362.50 → 1365.50] cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written
[1365.50 → 1366.54] in the book of the law.
[1366.54 → 1370.06] Clearly no one is justified before God by the law
[1370.06 → 1372.42] because the righteous will live by faith.
[1372.78 → 1374.86] The law is not based on faith.
[1375.34 → 1377.06] On the contrary, it says,
[1377.18 → 1379.34] whoever does these things will live by them.
[1380.34 → 1382.52] Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
[1382.52 → 1384.62] by becoming a curse for us.
[1385.04 → 1385.72] For it is written,
[1386.36 → 1388.38] cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.
[1389.18 → 1392.26] He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham
[1392.26 → 1395.24] might come to the Gentiles through Jesus Christ
[1395.24 → 1399.00] so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.
[1399.94 → 1401.10] And now to verse 26.
[1402.10 → 1403.36] So in Christ Jesus,
[1403.50 → 1405.34] you are all children of God through faith.
[1405.82 → 1408.02] For all of you who are baptized into Christ
[1408.02 → 1409.92] have clothed yourselves with Christ.
[1410.64 → 1412.36] There is neither Jew nor Gentile,
[1412.90 → 1414.06] neither slave nor free,
[1414.64 → 1415.58] neither male nor female,
[1415.58 → 1418.00] for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
[1418.40 → 1419.72] If you belong to Christ,
[1420.38 → 1421.90] then you are Abraham's seed.
[1422.26 → 1424.60] And heirs according to the promise.
[1429.44 → 1432.14] When I was just getting to know my wife, Brittany,
[1432.54 → 1433.24] in university,
[1433.76 → 1435.88] she invited me over to meet her family.
[1436.18 → 1438.20] And in one of those first meetings with the family,
[1438.32 → 1439.86] they were having a conversation together.
[1439.98 → 1441.26] You know, I'm on best behaviour.
[1442.00 → 1443.24] And her brother, Ben,
[1443.80 → 1444.72] shared this phrase.
[1444.78 → 1446.16] He said in the course of conversation,
[1446.60 → 1447.76] he said, wait, wait, wait.
[1448.36 → 1449.84] Who is Moscow?
[1449.84 → 1453.56] And then all the Going broke out into laughter.
[1454.14 → 1458.06] And I stood there having no idea why that was funny.
[1458.48 → 1460.28] And I finally had the guts to say to Brittany,
[1460.82 → 1462.54] what did Ben just say?
[1462.62 → 1463.84] And why are you all laughing?
[1464.48 → 1465.58] And then she's like, oh, right.
[1465.64 → 1466.64] You don't know the backstory.
[1466.64 → 1470.00] And she explained how she had a classmate in university
[1470.00 → 1471.46] who was studying for an exam.
[1471.90 → 1473.22] And in that studying for the exam,
[1473.32 → 1476.04] she thought Moscow was a person and not a place.
[1476.50 → 1477.56] And ever since that point,
[1477.62 → 1479.50] it's become a family joke in the Going family
[1479.50 → 1480.94] when they say, who is Moscow?
[1481.48 → 1483.32] And then it finally made sense to me.
[1484.26 → 1485.78] But perhaps you've had your own experience
[1485.78 → 1486.82] of who is Moscow,
[1486.94 → 1488.44] where you enter into a conversation,
[1488.92 → 1490.50] you're listening, trying to piece together,
[1490.50 → 1492.24] and it makes absolutely no sense
[1492.24 → 1493.92] because you don't know the backstory.
[1495.22 → 1496.92] If you've experienced that,
[1497.58 → 1499.88] you can understand what I think it might feel like
[1499.88 → 1501.02] to read Galatians 3.
[1501.96 → 1504.90] Galatians 3 is a complicated passage.
[1505.26 → 1506.78] In fact, it might very well be,
[1507.08 → 1507.86] according to some writers,
[1508.12 → 1510.48] the most complex piece of writing from Paul.
[1510.60 → 1512.10] So if you're a little bit confused
[1512.10 → 1513.94] by what we just read, it's okay.
[1514.74 → 1516.00] But also, I would say,
[1516.10 → 1517.90] Galatians 3 doesn't make any sense
[1517.90 → 1519.90] until you know the backstory.
[1520.90 → 1522.46] Paul assumes so much
[1522.46 → 1523.62] when he writes this letter
[1523.62 → 1525.52] of Old Testament story,
[1525.94 → 1528.02] of Old Testament people, right?
[1528.36 → 1530.30] And so Paul is just bringing these things
[1530.30 → 1530.96] into the foreground,
[1531.14 → 1532.16] and if we don't know the backstory,
[1532.32 → 1533.16] we're not going to understand.
[1533.96 → 1536.64] For example, he talks about blessings and curses.
[1536.74 → 1538.00] These are Old Testament things
[1538.00 → 1538.98] related to the law.
[1539.32 → 1542.74] He mentions a time the person of Abraham
[1542.74 → 1545.26] because Abraham is a big deal
[1545.26 → 1546.38] in the Old Testament story.
[1546.50 → 1547.74] And what we want to do this morning
[1547.74 → 1549.74] is open up that story,
[1550.04 → 1550.50] and hopefully,
[1550.70 → 1551.82] if you're new to the Christian faith
[1551.82 → 1552.96] or you're just reading the Bible,
[1553.24 → 1555.14] I hope actually that you'll get some clarity
[1555.14 → 1556.74] around the story of the Old Testament
[1556.74 → 1559.90] that helps us understand why Jesus matters,
[1560.30 → 1561.94] how Abraham fits into the story,
[1562.04 → 1563.38] and how we understand the law
[1563.38 → 1564.26] in relation to Jesus.
[1564.66 → 1566.50] No pressure, Dave, in one sermon.
[1568.40 → 1569.54] Yeah, I feel it.
[1570.54 → 1572.96] The reason Paul mentions Abraham
[1572.96 → 1574.84] eight times in Galatians 3
[1574.84 → 1577.34] is likely because there are these agitators,
[1577.54 → 1577.84] the Judaizes,
[1578.54 → 1580.26] who are coming into the churches in Galatia
[1580.26 → 1581.18] and saying to people,
[1581.62 → 1584.52] hey, if you want to be part of God's family,
[1584.68 → 1586.44] which is Abraham's family,
[1586.86 → 1588.40] this is how you have to live.
[1588.50 → 1589.46] There are works of the law,
[1589.58 → 1591.06] there's the practice of circumcision,
[1591.28 → 1593.12] and they're using Abraham as their example,
[1593.22 → 1594.18] saying if he did these things,
[1594.24 → 1595.76] then you have to do these things.
[1596.38 → 1598.18] And Paul, being quite fired up
[1598.18 → 1599.38] by what's happening in these churches,
[1599.48 → 1599.82] he says,
[1599.82 → 1601.40] let me tell you
[1601.40 → 1603.68] how Abraham fits into the story.
[1604.62 → 1606.22] So I'm going to read for you verse 7,
[1606.76 → 1608.14] and then we're going to go to the backstory
[1608.14 → 1609.94] and come back to Galatians 7
[1609.94 → 1611.04] in a few minutes.
[1611.10 → 1612.20] So this is how Paul starts
[1612.20 → 1613.26] when he talks about Abraham.
[1614.60 → 1615.74] Understand then
[1615.74 → 1617.76] that those who have faith
[1617.76 → 1619.38] are children of Abraham.
[1619.98 → 1620.98] Scripture foresaw
[1620.98 → 1623.90] that God would justify the Gentiles by faith
[1623.90 → 1625.82] and announced the gospel
[1625.82 → 1626.96] in advance to Abraham.
[1627.06 → 1628.16] Isn't that a fascinating phrase?
[1628.16 → 1631.12] All nations will be blessed through you.
[1631.62 → 1633.66] So those who rely on faith
[1633.66 → 1635.68] are blessed along with Abraham,
[1636.14 → 1636.94] the man of faith.
[1637.52 → 1639.26] Now if that's clear as mud,
[1639.42 → 1639.78] it's okay.
[1639.88 → 1640.98] We're going to work through this together.
[1641.44 → 1642.28] But let me just summarize
[1642.28 → 1644.12] what Paul is trying to get at here,
[1644.20 → 1645.04] and then we'll work it out.
[1645.58 → 1646.00] Paul is saying,
[1646.16 → 1646.72] number one,
[1647.72 → 1649.20] the faith in God,
[1649.36 → 1649.66] or sorry,
[1649.74 → 1650.84] the essence of the Christian faith
[1650.84 → 1652.06] is always faith,
[1652.14 → 1653.22] not just works of the law.
[1653.40 → 1654.92] Abraham from the very beginning,
[1655.02 → 1657.24] who's sort of the beginning of God's people,
[1657.24 → 1658.76] was a man of faith,
[1659.12 → 1660.74] and it was credited to him as righteousness.
[1660.90 → 1661.98] So faith is at the centre.
[1662.70 → 1663.94] But equally important,
[1664.08 → 1664.56] says Paul,
[1664.64 → 1665.90] is that the gospel was preached
[1665.90 → 1667.10] in advance to Abraham.
[1667.94 → 1668.86] And what was that gospel?
[1669.82 → 1671.54] That the nations would be blessed.
[1671.76 → 1672.86] That the blessing of God
[1672.86 → 1674.00] would move through Abraham
[1674.00 → 1674.76] to the nations.
[1674.90 → 1675.62] And I'll say this once
[1675.62 → 1676.30] and return to it.
[1676.30 → 1678.04] God's plan from the beginning
[1678.04 → 1679.74] was to have a global,
[1680.12 → 1681.10] multi-ethnic,
[1681.26 → 1682.04] diverse church.
[1682.68 → 1684.00] That was the plan from the beginning,
[1684.18 → 1685.04] that his people,
[1685.26 → 1686.12] unified by faith,
[1686.34 → 1688.06] would be unified by the nations
[1688.06 → 1689.50] coming in by faith to Jesus.
[1691.06 → 1692.44] So here's the backstory.
[1693.60 → 1694.52] In Genesis 3,
[1695.36 → 1697.16] God's good world came undone
[1697.16 → 1698.40] through an act of rebellion,
[1698.56 → 1699.02] through sin.
[1699.50 → 1700.92] Adam and Eve rebelled against God,
[1700.92 → 1701.76] and all of a sudden
[1701.76 → 1702.56] this new sickness,
[1702.80 → 1704.16] this new disease that is sin,
[1704.24 → 1705.74] started taking hold of human hearts
[1705.74 → 1706.68] and creating havoc.
[1707.16 → 1707.92] We see murder,
[1708.08 → 1708.74] we see jealousy,
[1708.96 → 1709.46] we see hate,
[1709.54 → 1710.16] we see lying,
[1710.26 → 1710.82] we see stealing.
[1711.16 → 1712.48] We see all sorts of corruption
[1712.48 → 1713.82] taking hold of humanity.
[1714.82 → 1715.68] God sends a flood
[1715.68 → 1717.24] to bring judgment and renewal.
[1717.38 → 1718.38] Even after the flood,
[1718.46 → 1719.66] we see sin just spreading
[1719.66 → 1720.98] through humanity.
[1721.58 → 1722.50] And it all culminates,
[1722.56 → 1723.04] you might say,
[1723.08 → 1723.92] in Genesis 11,
[1724.02 → 1724.86] which is the story
[1724.86 → 1726.08] of the Tower of Babel,
[1726.38 → 1728.02] where humanity comes together,
[1728.38 → 1729.08] not for worship,
[1729.46 → 1730.78] not to adore God,
[1730.92 → 1732.14] but to build themselves
[1732.14 → 1733.00] this structure
[1733.00 → 1735.44] that shows just how significant
[1735.44 → 1737.54] humanity is without God.
[1738.64 → 1739.74] And God's response
[1739.74 → 1741.02] after Genesis 3-11
[1741.02 → 1742.48] narrates the unravelling
[1742.48 → 1742.98] of humanity.
[1743.14 → 1744.56] His response to the wickedness
[1744.56 → 1745.20] of human hearts,
[1745.64 → 1747.22] his response to the deadliness
[1747.22 → 1748.46] of disobedience,
[1748.72 → 1749.62] of idolatry,
[1749.70 → 1751.30] is Abraham.
[1752.48 → 1753.14] Genesis 12,
[1753.70 → 1754.36] right on the heels
[1754.36 → 1755.12] of the Tower of Babel,
[1755.12 → 1756.36] God goes to this man
[1756.36 → 1757.72] named Abram at the time,
[1758.08 → 1758.42] and he says,
[1758.52 → 1758.90] Abram,
[1759.32 → 1760.60] I've got a plan.
[1760.92 → 1762.84] I'm selecting just you
[1762.84 → 1763.88] out of all of humanity
[1763.88 → 1765.34] as a new start,
[1765.46 → 1766.16] you might say.
[1766.52 → 1767.82] And I'm going to bless you,
[1767.96 → 1768.70] I'm going to enable you
[1768.70 → 1769.26] to flourish,
[1769.44 → 1770.30] I'm going to teach you
[1770.30 → 1771.12] how to live,
[1771.38 → 1772.64] and as you flourish,
[1772.92 → 1774.06] the nations will flourish,
[1774.14 → 1775.30] and my blessing will flow
[1775.30 → 1776.64] through you to them.
[1778.52 → 1779.38] Let me show you
[1779.38 → 1780.18] how God says it
[1780.18 → 1781.34] in Genesis 12.
[1781.58 → 1781.98] This is,
[1782.14 → 1782.64] in some sense,
[1782.70 → 1783.86] such an important verse
[1783.86 → 1784.44] for the whole
[1784.44 → 1785.44] Old Testament story.
[1786.10 → 1787.02] Because God starts
[1787.02 → 1787.48] with Abraham,
[1787.54 → 1788.30] and he says to him,
[1788.30 → 1789.78] I will make you
[1789.78 → 1790.62] into a great nation.
[1791.52 → 1792.50] I will bless you.
[1792.98 → 1794.26] I will make your name great,
[1794.34 → 1795.26] and you will be
[1795.26 → 1795.76] a blessing.
[1796.24 → 1797.06] I will bless those
[1797.06 → 1797.70] who bless you,
[1797.72 → 1798.72] and whoever curses you,
[1798.82 → 1799.46] I will curse,
[1799.68 → 1800.64] and all peoples
[1800.64 → 1801.86] of the earth
[1801.86 → 1802.76] will be blessed
[1802.76 → 1804.14] through you.
[1804.92 → 1805.98] A few chapters later,
[1806.10 → 1807.10] God binds himself
[1807.10 → 1807.62] in a covenant,
[1807.76 → 1808.18] which is just
[1808.18 → 1809.94] a really deep promise,
[1810.26 → 1811.36] and he says to Abraham
[1811.36 → 1812.34] in chapter 17
[1812.34 → 1812.88] of Genesis,
[1813.08 → 1813.92] no longer will you
[1813.92 → 1815.00] be called Abram,
[1815.00 → 1817.16] your name will be Abraham,
[1817.58 → 1818.60] for I have made you
[1818.60 → 1819.02] the what?
[1819.64 → 1822.04] The father of nations.
[1823.00 → 1824.18] I'll say the point again.
[1824.28 → 1826.00] God's plan from the beginning
[1826.00 → 1826.88] was a global,
[1827.18 → 1828.50] multi-ethnic family
[1828.50 → 1829.76] of faith,
[1830.34 → 1831.48] and he's now working
[1831.48 → 1832.14] through Abraham
[1832.14 → 1833.94] to make this possible,
[1834.04 → 1834.90] and if you know the story,
[1835.02 → 1835.96] Abraham has a child,
[1836.08 → 1836.70] Abraham and Sarah
[1836.70 → 1837.34] have a child,
[1837.48 → 1838.54] and then that child
[1838.54 → 1839.04] has children,
[1839.14 → 1839.84] and that becomes
[1839.84 → 1840.66] the people of Israel.
[1841.22 → 1842.66] That people become so vast,
[1842.74 → 1843.50] they go into slavery,
[1843.50 → 1844.08] and God,
[1844.16 → 1844.82] who's making good
[1844.82 → 1845.86] on his promise to Abraham,
[1846.18 → 1847.48] redeems them from slavery,
[1847.92 → 1849.40] brings Israel to himself
[1849.40 → 1849.96] in the wilderness,
[1850.14 → 1850.90] and he says to them,
[1851.42 → 1853.26] you are my people.
[1854.08 → 1855.06] You are the nation
[1855.06 → 1856.30] that I've pulled aside,
[1856.42 → 1857.48] you are my representative
[1857.48 → 1858.46] people to the world,
[1858.52 → 1859.48] and I'm going to bless you,
[1860.02 → 1860.84] I'm going to teach you
[1860.84 → 1861.46] my ways,
[1861.84 → 1863.42] you are going to flourish
[1863.42 → 1864.44] as you know me
[1864.44 → 1865.16] and follow me,
[1865.28 → 1865.94] and the nations
[1865.94 → 1866.64] are going to see
[1866.64 → 1867.10] that goodness
[1867.10 → 1868.28] and follow in the ways
[1868.28 → 1868.92] after you.
[1870.20 → 1870.96] This is where
[1870.96 → 1871.76] the law comes in.
[1872.10 → 1873.12] This is such an important detail.
[1873.12 → 1873.68] The law is not
[1873.68 → 1874.48] some oppressive thing
[1874.48 → 1875.18] that God adds
[1875.18 → 1875.76] to their lives,
[1875.94 → 1877.20] it's not some cruel thing,
[1877.44 → 1878.84] it's kind of like a parent
[1878.84 → 1880.06] whose kid who doesn't
[1880.06 → 1880.56] know how to live
[1880.56 → 1880.92] saying,
[1881.44 → 1882.88] let me teach you
[1882.88 → 1884.30] the way of life.
[1884.86 → 1885.56] So God gives
[1885.56 → 1886.32] the Ten Commandments,
[1886.36 → 1887.14] and he gives all sorts
[1887.14 → 1887.94] of case law
[1887.94 → 1888.90] and contextual law,
[1889.08 → 1889.88] including things
[1889.88 → 1890.88] as detailed as this,
[1891.32 → 1892.22] make sure when you
[1892.22 → 1892.94] build your house,
[1893.06 → 1893.96] put a roof around the
[1894.16 → 1895.56] or put a fence
[1895.56 → 1896.26] around the roof
[1896.26 → 1896.94] so that people don't
[1896.94 → 1897.74] fall out of your house.
[1897.80 → 1898.54] That's in the law,
[1898.78 → 1899.80] because God cares
[1899.80 → 1900.68] that our homes
[1900.68 → 1901.14] are places
[1901.14 → 1902.08] where people are safe.
[1902.08 → 1903.62] And God says to them,
[1903.94 → 1905.46] you follow my law,
[1906.08 → 1907.54] and you're going to flourish.
[1908.44 → 1909.40] If you don't,
[1909.58 → 1910.48] it's going to be painful.
[1911.58 → 1912.32] And this is,
[1912.46 → 1912.68] by the way,
[1912.72 → 1913.66] where we get that word
[1913.66 → 1914.34] of course.
[1914.44 → 1915.38] But before I get to curse,
[1915.44 → 1916.24] let me just say this.
[1916.70 → 1917.48] Deuteronomy 4,
[1918.12 → 1919.16] fascinating passage.
[1919.40 → 1920.06] It shows
[1920.06 → 1921.10] the nations
[1921.10 → 1922.18] around Israel
[1922.18 → 1923.24] looking in
[1923.24 → 1924.22] on their life together
[1924.22 → 1924.96] and saying,
[1925.60 → 1926.10] whoa,
[1926.10 → 1927.92] look at the justice
[1927.92 → 1928.84] of this society.
[1928.98 → 1929.62] Look at the care
[1929.62 → 1930.12] for the poor.
[1930.22 → 1931.10] Look at how the families
[1931.10 → 1932.20] are flourishing.
[1932.54 → 1934.38] Look how this whole society
[1934.38 → 1935.96] is flourishing.
[1936.74 → 1937.70] That was the plan
[1937.70 → 1939.14] for God calling Abraham,
[1939.62 → 1940.34] moving to the people
[1940.34 → 1940.76] of Israel,
[1941.04 → 1941.80] giving them the law,
[1941.96 → 1942.84] placing them in Canaan.
[1943.06 → 1944.18] It was so that the nations
[1944.18 → 1945.98] would come into this community
[1945.98 → 1947.10] and experience blessing.
[1948.48 → 1949.64] Now I wanna talk about
[1949.64 → 1950.84] this word that is curse.
[1952.02 → 1953.12] Now, first,
[1953.22 → 1954.18] when you hear the word curse,
[1954.18 → 1954.88] what do you think?
[1954.96 → 1955.98] What's in your brain right now?
[1957.22 → 1958.26] Is it Harry Potter?
[1959.44 → 1959.72] Ah.
[1960.54 → 1961.56] So I just want to say,
[1961.64 → 1962.54] when we hear the word curse,
[1962.62 → 1963.64] we're hearing something different
[1963.64 → 1964.82] than the Bible talks about
[1964.82 → 1965.94] when it says curse.
[1966.64 → 1967.46] Curse in the scriptures
[1967.46 → 1969.48] is perhaps best explained this way.
[1970.00 → 1971.14] If blessing means
[1971.14 → 1972.94] the favour and protection of God,
[1973.30 → 1975.00] curse is the absence of that.
[1975.52 → 1977.02] If blessing is the fullness
[1977.02 → 1979.48] of human life in relationship,
[1980.26 → 1981.48] curse is the absence
[1981.48 → 1983.16] and the emptiness of life
[1983.16 → 1983.84] in relationship
[1983.84 → 1985.62] when we live at a distance from God.
[1986.14 → 1987.90] It is sort of the removal of shalom,
[1988.02 → 1989.56] the removal of flourishing.
[1989.72 → 1990.88] That's what curse is.
[1991.52 → 1993.04] And in Deuteronomy 27 to 30,
[1993.14 → 1994.64] which actually are very important
[1994.64 → 1995.56] background passages
[1995.56 → 1996.56] for Galatians 3,
[1997.38 → 1998.62] it spells out very clearly
[1998.62 → 2000.30] if you follow the ways of God,
[2000.54 → 2001.70] the instructions of God,
[2001.76 → 2003.06] if you listen to him
[2003.06 → 2003.84] with a whole heart,
[2003.92 → 2005.42] you will be flourishing and blessed.
[2005.62 → 2006.52] And if you don't,
[2007.06 → 2008.32] you will experience curse.
[2009.10 → 2009.54] In fact,
[2009.60 → 2010.88] one of the very specific curses
[2010.88 → 2011.70] that's spelled out
[2011.70 → 2012.98] is exile.
[2013.66 → 2014.78] That the Israelites
[2014.78 → 2015.84] will lose their land.
[2017.50 → 2018.52] So if you know where the story
[2018.52 → 2019.10] goes from there,
[2019.22 → 2020.18] the Israel gets the law,
[2020.30 → 2021.26] they get put on the land,
[2021.32 → 2022.54] and then they chose
[2022.54 → 2024.06] the hard way.
[2024.54 → 2025.94] They rejected God's goodness,
[2026.12 → 2026.84] they didn't want to follow
[2026.84 → 2027.54] after his ways,
[2027.66 → 2028.62] they kept chasing
[2028.62 → 2029.74] the gods of the nations,
[2030.16 → 2031.00] rejecting the law,
[2031.00 → 2031.78] and what happened?
[2032.70 → 2033.30] The curse.
[2034.30 → 2034.64] In fact,
[2034.70 → 2035.64] the very exact thing
[2035.64 → 2036.18] that was predicted
[2036.18 → 2037.16] in Deuteronomy 27,
[2037.38 → 2038.78] they lost their land.
[2039.38 → 2040.12] And foreign nations
[2040.12 → 2041.26] came in and defeated them,
[2041.58 → 2042.28] subjected them,
[2042.34 → 2043.18] and made them slaves
[2043.18 → 2044.70] to those nations' interests
[2044.70 → 2046.00] and those nations' priorities.
[2047.10 → 2048.56] And if you're a first-time
[2048.56 → 2049.34] reader of the Bible,
[2049.80 → 2050.64] and you work your way
[2050.64 → 2051.20] through Genesis
[2051.20 → 2052.38] all the way to Malachi,
[2052.92 → 2054.60] it is actually quite a strange
[2054.60 → 2055.62] and confusing ending.
[2056.14 → 2056.86] We don't talk enough
[2056.86 → 2057.38] about this.
[2057.80 → 2058.96] The goal from the beginning
[2058.96 → 2060.32] was God to bring Abraham
[2060.32 → 2060.98] to himself,
[2061.18 → 2062.58] to form this people of Israel
[2062.58 → 2063.72] so that the nations
[2063.72 → 2064.72] experience blessing.
[2065.24 → 2065.88] And the Old Testament
[2065.88 → 2068.10] finishes with that nation
[2068.10 → 2069.28] experiencing curse,
[2069.56 → 2070.58] and the very nations
[2070.58 → 2071.80] they're supposed to bless
[2071.80 → 2073.22] oppressing them.
[2073.94 → 2074.50] And you have to think,
[2074.58 → 2074.98] okay, well,
[2075.04 → 2076.26] what's the plan here?
[2077.18 → 2078.64] And maybe the easiest way
[2078.64 → 2079.32] to summarize
[2079.32 → 2080.48] the Old Testament story,
[2080.82 → 2081.72] I hope this is helpful,
[2082.42 → 2084.22] is when the sickness of sin
[2084.22 → 2085.72] covered over God's good world
[2085.72 → 2087.78] and crept in the hearts
[2087.78 → 2088.78] of God's humanity,
[2088.96 → 2090.36] God chose Israel
[2090.36 → 2091.74] as a healing nation
[2091.74 → 2093.10] to sort of bring healing
[2093.10 → 2094.36] to where the sickness was.
[2094.76 → 2095.72] But what we realize
[2095.72 → 2096.92] at the end of the Old Testament
[2096.92 → 2098.70] is that Israel is just
[2098.70 → 2100.10] as infected by the sickness
[2100.10 → 2100.60] of sin
[2100.60 → 2102.16] as all the other nations.
[2102.66 → 2103.74] And now we're stuck
[2103.74 → 2104.68] with this thing
[2104.68 → 2105.32] that is the mess
[2105.32 → 2105.88] in the nations
[2105.88 → 2107.46] and in God's special people,
[2108.02 → 2108.26] Israel.
[2109.88 → 2111.16] With all this background
[2111.16 → 2111.78] in mind,
[2112.06 → 2113.16] this Old Testament story,
[2113.28 → 2115.20] I now want to read for us
[2115.20 → 2117.58] Galatians 3, 13, and 14.
[2117.58 → 2118.46] And I hope it's going to
[2118.46 → 2119.34] just piece some things
[2119.34 → 2120.28] together for us.
[2120.82 → 2121.28] We read,
[2122.48 → 2123.38] Christ redeemed us
[2123.38 → 2124.82] from the curse of the law
[2124.82 → 2127.42] by becoming a curse for us.
[2128.02 → 2128.84] For it is written,
[2129.12 → 2129.82] cursed is everyone
[2129.82 → 2130.84] who is hung on a pole.
[2131.78 → 2132.58] He redeemed us
[2132.58 → 2134.06] in order that the blessing
[2134.06 → 2135.38] given to Abraham
[2135.38 → 2137.50] might come to the Gentiles
[2137.50 → 2138.40] through Christ Jesus
[2138.40 → 2140.20] so that by faith
[2140.20 → 2141.60] we might receive
[2141.60 → 2143.52] the promise of the Spirit.
[2144.10 → 2144.84] It's making a little bit
[2144.84 → 2145.46] more sense now.
[2146.90 → 2148.08] Let me walk us through
[2148.08 → 2148.70] some of the movement.
[2148.82 → 2149.22] Number one,
[2149.30 → 2149.98] let me underscore
[2149.98 → 2151.32] Paul's main concern
[2151.32 → 2152.70] is to recognize
[2152.70 → 2153.36] that the law
[2153.36 → 2154.14] of the Old Testament
[2154.14 → 2155.64] could not solve
[2155.64 → 2156.68] the problem of sin.
[2156.96 → 2157.84] It could not curb
[2157.84 → 2158.52] human hearts
[2158.52 → 2159.92] and people even knowing
[2159.92 → 2160.62] what was good
[2160.62 → 2161.32] and knowing the good
[2161.32 → 2161.98] instruction of God
[2161.98 → 2163.34] chose the way of course.
[2163.94 → 2164.92] So the movement now
[2164.92 → 2165.82] of Galatians 3 is
[2165.82 → 2167.06] the whole world
[2167.06 → 2167.98] lives in rebellion
[2167.98 → 2168.92] under the curse.
[2169.62 → 2171.20] God's representative people
[2171.20 → 2172.08] who were chosen
[2172.08 → 2172.80] for blessing
[2172.80 → 2174.54] also chose the way
[2174.54 → 2175.12] of the curse
[2175.12 → 2176.02] and now
[2176.02 → 2177.52] here's the good news.
[2178.34 → 2179.48] There is a representative
[2179.48 → 2180.68] within Israel
[2180.68 → 2181.96] who's going to take on
[2181.96 → 2182.48] the curse
[2182.48 → 2183.88] and that is Jesus.
[2184.66 → 2185.18] For Paul,
[2185.26 → 2185.88] the good news is
[2185.88 → 2187.28] yes, the curse is spread.
[2187.48 → 2188.60] Yes, it's infected Israel
[2188.60 → 2189.84] but good news church,
[2190.46 → 2191.52] there is a representative
[2191.52 → 2192.24] within Israel
[2192.24 → 2193.28] who is going to become
[2193.28 → 2194.32] that curse,
[2194.84 → 2195.56] Jesus Christ.
[2196.24 → 2197.16] He takes on
[2197.16 → 2197.82] the punishment
[2197.82 → 2198.78] for disobedience.
[2198.86 → 2199.40] He takes on
[2199.40 → 2200.32] the consequence
[2200.32 → 2201.06] for sin.
[2201.06 → 2202.94] He takes on
[2202.94 → 2203.66] the consequence
[2203.66 → 2204.34] of rebellion
[2204.34 → 2206.04] or as we read
[2206.04 → 2206.50] in the scriptures,
[2206.66 → 2207.06] he takes on
[2207.06 → 2207.96] the cup of judgment
[2207.96 → 2209.60] of God's wrath
[2209.60 → 2210.46] for the sake
[2210.46 → 2211.56] of humanity's rebellion
[2211.56 → 2212.90] so that we would be
[2212.90 → 2214.14] free from under
[2214.14 → 2214.66] the curse.
[2215.48 → 2216.28] And he does it
[2216.28 → 2217.60] once and for all
[2217.60 → 2219.00] on the cross.
[2220.32 → 2221.14] And for Paul,
[2221.42 → 2222.20] over and over,
[2222.28 → 2222.56] he's like,
[2222.76 → 2223.64] that's the point
[2223.64 → 2224.26] of liberation.
[2224.78 → 2225.60] That's the point
[2225.60 → 2226.40] where we get redeemed.
[2226.50 → 2227.40] It wasn't in the law,
[2227.40 → 2228.18] it wasn't in any
[2228.18 → 2228.82] former time.
[2229.16 → 2229.96] What liberates us
[2229.96 → 2230.86] once and for all
[2230.86 → 2231.42] is the death
[2231.42 → 2231.88] and resurrection
[2231.88 → 2232.48] of Jesus.
[2232.64 → 2233.66] He just keeps harping
[2233.66 → 2234.70] on that point
[2234.70 → 2235.40] in Galatians.
[2236.78 → 2238.00] But here's the why.
[2238.40 → 2239.14] This is the good news.
[2239.22 → 2239.92] This is where we come
[2239.92 → 2240.50] into the story
[2240.50 → 2241.04] of Galatians.
[2241.18 → 2241.64] Paul writes,
[2242.04 → 2243.04] he redeemed us
[2243.04 → 2244.18] in order
[2244.18 → 2245.72] that the blessing
[2245.72 → 2246.92] given to Abraham
[2246.92 → 2248.00] might, what,
[2248.42 → 2249.78] come to the Gentiles
[2249.78 → 2251.14] so that through Christ,
[2251.32 → 2251.92] by faith,
[2252.10 → 2252.84] we might receive
[2252.84 → 2253.30] the promise
[2253.30 → 2253.90] of the Spirit.
[2254.90 → 2255.94] That is to say,
[2256.78 → 2257.74] God's plan
[2257.74 → 2258.52] with Abraham
[2258.52 → 2260.06] can now
[2260.06 → 2261.60] finally move forward
[2261.60 → 2262.88] because the curse
[2262.88 → 2263.28] of sin
[2263.28 → 2264.20] has been dealt with.
[2264.82 → 2265.62] And then that means
[2265.62 → 2266.54] very specifically
[2266.54 → 2267.70] that all of us
[2267.70 → 2268.48] Gentiles,
[2268.58 → 2269.46] we are the Gentiles,
[2269.58 → 2270.80] who call on the name
[2270.80 → 2271.26] of Jesus
[2271.26 → 2271.98] and put our faith
[2271.98 → 2272.28] in Him,
[2272.66 → 2273.90] we get grafted
[2273.90 → 2275.04] into the family
[2275.04 → 2276.94] by faith.
[2277.98 → 2278.98] Every one of us
[2278.98 → 2279.32] who says,
[2279.42 → 2280.22] I believe in Jesus,
[2280.34 → 2281.44] I want to follow Him,
[2281.52 → 2282.60] I receive His grace
[2282.60 → 2283.08] by faith,
[2283.36 → 2285.34] we join the family,
[2285.34 → 2287.42] we receive the Spirit
[2287.42 → 2287.86] and man,
[2287.94 → 2288.54] I can already
[2288.54 → 2289.20] look forward to
[2289.20 → 2289.88] in two weeks' time
[2289.88 → 2291.30] the amazing things
[2291.30 → 2292.44] Paul says about the Spirit
[2292.44 → 2293.78] in contrast to the law,
[2293.86 → 2295.02] but that's a different sermon.
[2296.90 → 2297.86] Let me finish
[2297.86 → 2299.08] with how Paul finishes
[2299.08 → 2299.82] Galatians 3
[2299.82 → 2300.58] and work out
[2300.58 → 2301.12] some of these
[2301.12 → 2302.74] beautiful words with you.
[2303.84 → 2304.94] Galatians 3, 28,
[2305.06 → 2305.98] he says to the church,
[2305.98 → 2307.38] So in Christ Jesus,
[2308.12 → 2309.06] you are all children
[2309.06 → 2310.26] of God through faith.
[2311.08 → 2311.94] For all of you
[2311.94 → 2312.60] who were baptized
[2312.60 → 2313.34] into Christ
[2313.34 → 2314.58] have clothed yourselves
[2314.58 → 2315.30] with Christ.
[2316.00 → 2316.80] There is neither Jew
[2316.80 → 2317.68] nor Gentile,
[2318.28 → 2319.52] neither slave nor free.
[2320.20 → 2321.46] There is male nor female,
[2321.82 → 2323.32] for you are all one
[2323.32 → 2324.78] in Christ Jesus.
[2325.52 → 2326.80] If you belong to Christ,
[2326.98 → 2328.46] you are Abraham's seed
[2328.46 → 2330.04] and heirs according
[2330.04 → 2331.60] to the promise.
[2332.22 → 2333.06] I don't have time
[2333.06 → 2333.88] to preach on this today,
[2334.00 → 2334.92] but when Paul says
[2334.92 → 2335.46] you are heirs
[2335.46 → 2336.34] according to the promise,
[2336.66 → 2337.58] he says to the church,
[2337.68 → 2338.74] by faith you get
[2338.74 → 2339.80] to inherit the earth.
[2340.66 → 2341.34] After death,
[2341.38 → 2342.36] your bodies will rise
[2342.36 → 2343.00] and the creation
[2343.00 → 2343.50] will be renewed
[2343.50 → 2344.38] and you will live on it
[2344.38 → 2345.00] forever,
[2345.00 → 2346.24] because the promise
[2346.24 → 2346.84] to the church
[2346.84 → 2348.00] is eternal life
[2348.00 → 2349.28] in a resurrected world
[2349.28 → 2350.64] with resurrected bodies.
[2352.54 → 2354.46] God's plan all along.
[2355.52 → 2356.96] It was a multi-ethnic,
[2357.30 → 2358.22] global church
[2358.22 → 2360.48] that is united by faith.
[2361.26 → 2362.30] And can we just stop
[2362.30 → 2363.12] and marvel together
[2363.12 → 2364.24] that even as we worship,
[2364.90 → 2367.04] we get to taste that together.
[2367.80 → 2368.16] I mean,
[2368.28 → 2369.34] there's a lot of us here
[2369.34 → 2370.06] from different parts
[2370.06 → 2370.42] of the world,
[2370.54 → 2371.20] different backgrounds,
[2371.20 → 2372.06] and we get to worship
[2372.06 → 2372.98] Jesus together.
[2373.88 → 2375.04] This week in my office,
[2375.12 → 2376.90] I wrote down just a quick list
[2376.90 → 2377.56] of the countries
[2377.56 → 2378.48] that I know of
[2378.48 → 2379.14] that are represented
[2379.14 → 2379.86] in our church
[2379.86 → 2381.32] and I'll read them off.
[2381.38 → 2381.84] If you're missing,
[2381.98 → 2382.96] it's not because I don't like you,
[2383.04 → 2383.84] it's because I just forgot
[2383.84 → 2384.52] about your country.
[2385.18 → 2386.04] So here we go.
[2386.66 → 2387.52] Whenever you make a list,
[2387.58 → 2388.38] you always forget someone.
[2389.96 → 2390.72] In our church,
[2390.80 → 2392.28] people worship from Taiwan,
[2392.86 → 2393.24] Korea,
[2393.92 → 2394.30] China,
[2394.30 → 2395.42] the Philippines,
[2396.12 → 2396.46] India,
[2396.82 → 2397.30] Nigeria,
[2397.70 → 2398.02] Ghana,
[2398.40 → 2398.72] Holland,
[2398.98 → 2399.50] Honduras,
[2399.66 → 2400.18] El Salvador,
[2400.60 → 2401.02] Venezuela,
[2401.62 → 2402.56] even the U.S.
[2402.92 → 2403.72] and Canada.
[2404.82 → 2406.00] Praise the Lord
[2406.00 → 2407.70] for the diversity
[2407.70 → 2408.50] of the church.
[2409.02 → 2410.10] This was the plan
[2410.10 → 2411.20] all along.
[2411.80 → 2412.30] The plan
[2412.30 → 2413.32] when God called Abraham
[2413.32 → 2414.80] was that we would share
[2414.80 → 2415.62] in the blessing
[2415.62 → 2417.06] that our lives
[2417.06 → 2418.06] would be put back together
[2418.06 → 2418.90] by the work of Jesus,
[2419.12 → 2420.42] that we could experience
[2420.42 → 2421.30] the fullness of life.
[2421.50 → 2422.48] That was the plan.
[2422.96 → 2423.66] And here we are
[2423.66 → 2424.44] worshipping Jesus
[2424.44 → 2426.02] as part of proof
[2426.02 → 2427.46] that the work of Christ
[2427.46 → 2428.32] was accomplishing
[2428.32 → 2429.58] exactly what it needed to.
[2430.24 → 2431.18] That God's family
[2431.18 → 2432.46] is a global,
[2432.86 → 2434.06] multi-ethnic family.
[2435.72 → 2436.12] Now,
[2436.24 → 2437.36] just in the last couple of weeks,
[2437.54 → 2438.20] I've been able to meet
[2438.20 → 2438.94] with some of the people
[2438.94 → 2439.48] in our church
[2439.48 → 2440.08] who are new
[2440.08 → 2440.98] from different parts
[2440.98 → 2441.38] of the world.
[2442.06 → 2442.48] You're going to meet
[2442.48 → 2443.26] some of them next week
[2443.26 → 2444.22] as we have our new members
[2444.22 → 2445.28] welcome, and we baptize
[2445.28 → 2445.74] two people.
[2446.46 → 2447.32] But two families
[2447.32 → 2447.82] that I met with,
[2447.88 → 2448.64] one was from China,
[2448.90 → 2450.16] the other was originally
[2450.16 → 2450.70] from India
[2450.70 → 2451.64] and then Qatar.
[2452.62 → 2453.60] And it was such a privilege
[2453.60 → 2454.42] I'm looking for
[2454.42 → 2455.10] some of them right now.
[2455.20 → 2455.74] I see one of them,
[2455.82 → 2456.64] Aves and Sialic.
[2457.08 → 2457.96] Such a privilege
[2457.96 → 2459.36] to hear the stories
[2459.36 → 2460.44] of how they came to faith,
[2461.32 → 2461.86] hear the stories
[2461.86 → 2462.72] of how people share
[2462.72 → 2463.58] the gospel with them,
[2463.66 → 2464.58] the churches they found,
[2464.66 → 2465.76] the people who discipled them.
[2465.92 → 2466.80] And I just get to see,
[2466.92 → 2467.14] wow,
[2467.28 → 2468.20] God is at work
[2468.20 → 2469.10] in Qatar
[2469.10 → 2469.84] and India
[2469.84 → 2470.50] and China.
[2470.74 → 2471.30] He's at work
[2471.30 → 2472.06] in all these places.
[2472.20 → 2473.12] He's forming churches,
[2473.26 → 2473.86] planting churches,
[2474.22 → 2474.92] raising up leaders.
[2475.10 → 2476.40] Praise the Lord for that.
[2477.14 → 2478.44] But equally so,
[2479.26 → 2480.46] I was talking
[2480.46 → 2480.74] with someone
[2480.74 → 2481.50] after the 9 a.m. service
[2481.50 → 2481.88] about this.
[2481.94 → 2482.74] I had one of those moments
[2482.74 → 2483.40] where your heart
[2483.40 → 2484.30] is burning within you
[2484.30 → 2485.02] thinking to yourself,
[2485.42 → 2486.10] this person
[2486.10 → 2487.42] who was discipled
[2487.42 → 2488.84] by someone in Send
[2488.84 → 2490.90] or Southeast Asia,
[2491.28 → 2492.20] they are now sitting
[2492.20 → 2493.06] with me in my office
[2493.06 → 2493.96] and we're brothers
[2493.96 → 2495.86] and sisters in faith.
[2496.78 → 2498.52] What an amazing reality
[2498.52 → 2500.38] that we get to share
[2500.38 → 2501.44] in the life of the Spirit.
[2501.56 → 2502.26] We get to share
[2502.26 → 2503.68] in being part of Abraham's family
[2503.68 → 2504.96] because of what Jesus has done.
[2505.36 → 2506.40] Praise the Lord
[2506.40 → 2508.60] that we get to be the church,
[2509.18 → 2509.86] that we share
[2509.86 → 2510.44] in the blessing
[2510.44 → 2511.24] that God promised
[2511.24 → 2513.48] thousands of years ago.
[2514.58 → 2514.92] Amen.
[2516.40 → 2517.18] And I could say
[2517.18 → 2518.12] a lot more about this,
[2518.24 → 2519.12] but I want to be short.
[2520.08 → 2520.76] Did that come up
[2520.76 → 2521.26] on the screen?
[2524.06 → 2524.84] Thanks, Tree.
[2527.74 → 2529.20] In Galatians 3.28,
[2529.30 → 2530.18] one of the things
[2530.18 → 2530.72] that he's trying
[2530.72 → 2531.28] to communicate
[2531.28 → 2532.94] is the beautiful way
[2532.94 → 2533.50] in which everyone
[2533.50 → 2534.36] comes into the church
[2534.36 → 2534.86] by grace
[2534.86 → 2535.44] and there can be
[2535.44 → 2536.90] no upper and lower class.
[2537.16 → 2537.74] So when he says
[2537.74 → 2539.20] there's no Jew nor Gentile,
[2539.30 → 2540.04] slave nor free,
[2540.18 → 2540.84] male nor female,
[2540.90 → 2541.60] what he's saying is
[2541.60 → 2543.38] everyone enters the church
[2543.38 → 2544.06] as equals.
[2545.08 → 2545.76] And that means
[2545.76 → 2546.48] there's no lording
[2546.48 → 2547.34] over anybody,
[2547.44 → 2549.08] your socioeconomic class.
[2549.46 → 2550.08] There's no lording
[2550.08 → 2550.70] over anyone,
[2550.76 → 2551.74] the kind of family background
[2551.74 → 2552.36] you came from
[2552.36 → 2553.00] or your ethnicity.
[2553.34 → 2554.76] We are all one in Christ.
[2555.66 → 2556.48] And I'll just share
[2556.48 → 2557.24] a little bit personally
[2557.24 → 2559.00] that I grew up
[2559.00 → 2560.12] in a Dutch community,
[2560.26 → 2560.70] predominantly,
[2560.86 → 2561.42] Dutch-Canadian,
[2561.60 → 2562.84] a lot of immigrant families.
[2563.58 → 2564.46] And you don't know this,
[2564.54 → 2565.28] but you kind of grow up
[2565.28 → 2566.32] with a sense of pride
[2566.32 → 2567.52] with the culture you grew up in.
[2567.52 → 2568.18] Now that's a good thing.
[2568.26 → 2569.16] It's good to love
[2569.16 → 2570.18] the formation,
[2570.36 → 2570.84] your background.
[2571.44 → 2572.18] But I have learned
[2572.18 → 2572.68] that at least
[2572.68 → 2573.32] I can only speak
[2573.32 → 2574.04] for Dutch culture,
[2574.52 → 2575.50] that there are lots of phrases
[2575.50 → 2576.12] we use
[2576.12 → 2577.32] and lots of statements
[2577.32 → 2577.84] we make
[2577.84 → 2579.38] that suddenly make ourselves
[2579.38 → 2580.54] better than everybody else.
[2581.12 → 2581.34] Right?
[2581.38 → 2582.30] We look down on everyone.
[2582.40 → 2583.16] And I think part of that
[2583.16 → 2584.46] is Dutch people are so tall,
[2584.74 → 2585.46] they just naturally
[2585.46 → 2586.28] look down on people.
[2588.18 → 2589.22] And jokes aside,
[2589.30 → 2590.20] let me just put it this way,
[2590.26 → 2591.48] there is no room for that
[2591.48 → 2592.62] in the Church of Jesus Christ.
[2594.26 → 2595.04] That's what Jews
[2595.04 → 2595.74] struggled with.
[2595.84 → 2596.92] As the Gentiles came in,
[2596.92 → 2597.18] they're like,
[2597.28 → 2597.88] whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2598.06 → 2599.82] They're not quite Jewish enough.
[2599.90 → 2600.56] And Paul says,
[2600.84 → 2601.88] they are exactly
[2601.88 → 2603.08] what God wanted
[2603.08 → 2603.78] in His Church.
[2604.38 → 2605.20] All the cultures,
[2605.38 → 2606.16] all the ethnicities,
[2606.32 → 2607.18] that was the plan
[2607.18 → 2608.00] from the beginning
[2608.00 → 2609.06] by faith.
[2609.74 → 2610.58] And so there's no room
[2610.58 → 2610.88] for saying,
[2610.96 → 2611.70] ah, that person,
[2612.22 → 2612.66] I don't know how
[2612.66 → 2613.38] they made it in.
[2613.92 → 2614.66] That culture,
[2614.86 → 2615.86] surely they know
[2615.86 → 2616.56] that our culture
[2616.56 → 2617.30] is better than theirs.
[2617.30 → 2618.32] And it's all sorts
[2618.32 → 2619.08] of subtle things
[2619.08 → 2619.54] in the Church
[2619.54 → 2620.08] where we say,
[2620.36 → 2620.90] we're here,
[2621.22 → 2621.84] you're there.
[2621.94 → 2622.50] And Paul says,
[2622.58 → 2625.06] the Gospel is the great equalizer.
[2626.54 → 2627.42] It is the place
[2627.42 → 2628.62] where every single person
[2628.62 → 2629.86] who comes in the family of Christ
[2629.86 → 2631.98] comes by the grace of Jesus.
[2632.94 → 2633.56] Through the faith
[2633.56 → 2634.78] we share with our brothers
[2634.78 → 2635.38] and sisters.
[2635.92 → 2636.72] And there are no
[2636.72 → 2637.80] second-class citizens
[2637.80 → 2638.46] in the Church.
[2638.86 → 2640.58] May the Lord have mercy on us
[2640.58 → 2642.34] for the ways we subtly
[2642.34 → 2643.26] and not so subtly
[2643.26 → 2644.22] have those things
[2644.22 → 2645.50] in the body of Christ.
[2645.50 → 2646.58] Because he says,
[2646.70 → 2649.52] we are one in Christ Jesus.
[2650.30 → 2651.18] And what a gift it is
[2651.18 → 2652.18] to be one in Christ.
[2652.32 → 2652.54] I mean,
[2652.76 → 2653.40] this is sort of
[2653.40 → 2654.48] maybe a trivial example
[2654.48 → 2655.32] but it's not to me.
[2655.68 → 2656.30] I grew up in a
[2656.38 → 2657.34] I love Dutch food.
[2658.10 → 2658.70] That's why I make
[2658.70 → 2659.16] orioles
[2659.16 → 2660.88] on our front lawn
[2660.88 → 2662.10] at New Year's.
[2662.64 → 2663.32] But I realized
[2663.32 → 2663.94] as I got to know
[2663.94 → 2664.68] some people from India
[2664.68 → 2665.28] and Korea
[2665.28 → 2666.06] and other places
[2666.06 → 2666.48] in the world
[2666.48 → 2667.10] that there are actually
[2667.10 → 2667.88] a lot more spices
[2667.88 → 2668.44] in the cupboard
[2668.44 → 2669.66] than salt and pepper.
[2670.90 → 2672.46] And once you taste
[2672.46 → 2673.18] some of those spices,
[2673.30 → 2674.50] I see a couple in the back
[2674.50 → 2675.36] that they,
[2675.50 → 2676.18] they introduced me
[2676.18 → 2677.08] to follow rice
[2677.08 → 2678.22] that I almost died of heat.
[2678.52 → 2679.34] But it was amazing.
[2680.62 → 2681.82] We need each other
[2681.82 → 2683.42] and we will be enriched
[2683.42 → 2684.74] by each other
[2684.74 → 2686.52] and God delights
[2686.52 → 2688.22] when the diverse body
[2688.22 → 2688.60] of Christ
[2688.60 → 2689.26] comes together
[2689.26 → 2691.14] in real meaningful unity
[2691.14 → 2692.92] to share fellowship,
[2693.16 → 2693.96] to share food,
[2694.20 → 2696.36] to be a family in Christ.
[2697.28 → 2697.94] And I'm convinced
[2697.94 → 2699.06] that's probably why
[2699.06 → 2700.28] I love doing communion
[2700.28 → 2701.10] so much at Hope.
[2701.10 → 2702.98] I love having
[2702.98 → 2703.88] these tables set up
[2703.88 → 2704.86] and the elders and deacons,
[2704.96 → 2705.44] they stand by
[2705.44 → 2705.90] in these tables
[2705.90 → 2706.76] and you see people
[2706.76 → 2707.70] from different backgrounds,
[2708.54 → 2709.48] different parts of the city,
[2709.58 → 2710.40] different parts of the country,
[2710.50 → 2711.36] different parts of the world
[2711.36 → 2712.40] with different pain
[2712.40 → 2713.00] and hardship,
[2713.36 → 2714.22] whatever our story is
[2714.22 → 2715.22] and we walk up together,
[2715.52 → 2716.62] we receive the elements
[2716.62 → 2717.58] and we get to hear God
[2717.58 → 2718.60] say to us through his leaders,
[2718.98 → 2719.82] the blood of Christ
[2719.82 → 2720.36] shed for you,
[2720.42 → 2721.14] the body of Christ
[2721.14 → 2721.76] given for you.
[2722.10 → 2723.76] You belong in the family
[2723.76 → 2725.70] because of the grace of Christ
[2725.70 → 2726.72] just like everyone else
[2726.72 → 2727.36] in the church.
[2727.36 → 2728.84] I love it.
[2729.26 → 2730.88] The unity of the body of Christ.
[2731.40 → 2732.70] And I will say this as well,
[2733.60 → 2735.78] that when we live in unity,
[2736.60 → 2737.44] meaningful unity,
[2738.00 → 2739.18] we demonstrate
[2739.18 → 2741.92] the power of the gospel.
[2743.36 → 2745.54] The law did not create
[2745.54 → 2747.58] a unified, diverse family,
[2748.10 → 2749.66] but Jesus Christ did.
[2750.30 → 2751.04] And when we live
[2751.04 → 2751.86] in meaningful unity
[2751.86 → 2753.26] with our ethnicity,
[2753.50 → 2753.96] with our different
[2753.96 → 2755.20] socioeconomic backgrounds,
[2755.52 → 2756.08] male and female
[2756.08 → 2756.62] and all the rest,
[2756.62 → 2758.88] we show to a polarizing,
[2759.32 → 2760.50] trivializing,
[2760.96 → 2761.76] cancel culture
[2761.76 → 2762.72] that we live in
[2762.72 → 2763.74] that the gospel
[2763.74 → 2764.48] does have power.
[2765.38 → 2766.98] We show that we can live together
[2766.98 → 2767.86] as brothers and sisters
[2767.86 → 2769.24] by our united faith
[2769.24 → 2769.98] in Jesus Christ
[2769.98 → 2772.14] and that will always be
[2772.14 → 2773.32] a powerful witness
[2773.32 → 2774.36] in whatever culture
[2774.36 → 2774.78] you live in
[2774.78 → 2775.54] where there will always be
[2775.54 → 2776.92] something that wants
[2776.92 → 2777.68] to tear us apart,
[2777.96 → 2778.88] something that wants
[2778.88 → 2779.46] to make us live
[2779.46 → 2781.12] as first or second class citizens.
[2781.42 → 2783.26] The gospel has power
[2783.26 → 2785.14] and we demonstrate that
[2785.14 → 2786.30] in our unity.
[2786.62 → 2790.18] And I'll just say again,
[2790.40 → 2790.64] yeah.
[2790.64 → 2790.74] Yeah.
[2798.10 → 2799.76] I do think that one of the ways
[2799.76 → 2800.96] we respond to a passage
[2800.96 → 2801.90] like Galatians 3
[2801.90 → 2803.54] is to marvel
[2803.54 → 2805.18] that we are living
[2805.18 → 2806.14] in the very thing
[2806.14 → 2807.52] God had in his mind
[2807.52 → 2808.76] when he called Abraham.
[2809.62 → 2810.64] The blessing,
[2811.24 → 2812.12] the flourishing,
[2812.50 → 2813.16] the shalom
[2813.16 → 2814.14] and the life of God
[2814.14 → 2815.12] flowing to the nations,
[2815.12 → 2817.52] we are receiving that
[2817.52 → 2819.02] because Jesus dealt
[2819.02 → 2819.70] with the curse.
[2820.40 → 2821.74] Praise the Lord.
[2822.52 → 2823.40] Let's pray together.
[2826.60 → 2827.82] Father, we thank you
[2827.82 → 2828.44] for your word.
[2829.72 → 2830.58] We thank you
[2830.58 → 2832.14] that you have brought us
[2832.14 → 2833.34] into your family.
[2834.34 → 2834.92] We thank you
[2834.92 → 2835.84] that this was your plan
[2835.84 → 2836.74] all along
[2836.74 → 2838.08] and even as we drove it
[2838.08 → 2838.86] into the ground
[2838.86 → 2839.92] in disobedience
[2839.92 → 2842.28] and idolatry,
[2843.16 → 2844.22] enslaving ourselves
[2844.22 → 2845.32] to all sorts of things
[2845.32 → 2846.20] that do not bring life.
[2846.20 → 2847.74] You came in Jesus.
[2848.60 → 2849.72] We praise you
[2849.72 → 2850.70] that Jesus has dealt
[2850.70 → 2851.32] with the curse.
[2852.20 → 2852.90] We praise you
[2852.90 → 2853.52] that he drank
[2853.52 → 2854.32] the cup of judgment.
[2855.10 → 2855.78] We praise you
[2855.78 → 2857.20] that we have been set free.
[2858.20 → 2858.38] Lord,
[2858.48 → 2859.52] would you unify us
[2859.52 → 2860.18] in the gospel?
[2861.10 → 2862.38] Would you strengthen us
[2862.38 → 2863.12] as the church?
[2863.54 → 2863.96] And we pray
[2863.96 → 2864.96] that many more people
[2864.96 → 2865.72] in this city,
[2866.20 → 2867.12] in our families,
[2867.12 → 2868.20] in our workplaces
[2868.20 → 2869.58] would buy faith
[2869.58 → 2870.66] recognize the power
[2870.66 → 2871.26] of the gospel
[2871.26 → 2872.70] and join the family
[2872.70 → 2873.38] of the resurrection.
[2874.08 → 2874.66] We pray this
[2874.66 → 2875.46] in your mighty name.
[2875.78 → 2876.00] Amen.
[2877.32 → 2878.08] Would you stand
[2878.08 → 2878.64] and sing with me
[2878.64 → 2879.56] a song of response?
