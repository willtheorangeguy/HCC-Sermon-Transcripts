[0.42 --> 5.14]  We are going to start a new sermon series today on the book of Jude.
[5.86 --> 8.22]  And I asked this in the 9 a.m. service, I'll ask it again.
[8.34 --> 12.96]  How many of you, by show of hands, have ever heard a sermon on the book of Jude?
[14.26 --> 17.58]  One, two, oh okay, that's more than the 9 a.m., the 9 a.m. at two.
[17.98 --> 21.90]  So between both services, five people have heard a sermon on Jude.
[22.40 --> 24.88]  So for the next three weeks, we're going to dive into this book,
[25.36 --> 28.90]  which has turned out, at least for me, to have a lot more fascinating elements
[28.90 --> 32.46]  and even challenging pieces, but it's going to be something we get to do together.
[33.14 --> 37.46]  So here's the challenge I'm going to put out before you, before we start the series,
[37.56 --> 40.20]  and that is to read the whole book of Jude in one sitting.
[41.50 --> 42.78]  Do you know how hard that is?
[44.10 --> 44.94]  This is Jude.
[46.98 --> 49.98]  By audio, it is four minutes and 36 seconds.
[50.20 --> 53.22]  So you can read it pretty quick, and it's going to be great.
[53.30 --> 56.58]  So please do that this week and in the coming weeks as we preach our way through it.
[56.58 --> 59.90]  I'm going to read the first four verses that really, in some sense,
[60.26 --> 62.62]  overview and introduce why this letter is written.
[64.86 --> 69.18]  Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James,
[69.74 --> 75.62]  to those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ,
[76.48 --> 80.04]  mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance.
[81.40 --> 85.68]  Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share,
[85.68 --> 91.74]  I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that the Lord is once for all
[91.74 --> 93.72]  entrusted to us, his people.
[94.64 --> 100.90]  For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you.
[101.62 --> 107.16]  They are ungodly people who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality
[107.16 --> 111.88]  and deny Jesus Christ our only sovereign and Lord.
[111.88 --> 111.98]  God's word.
[112.98 --> 114.44]  This is God's word.
[119.44 --> 127.38]  I have a brother named Sean, and the two of us have an ongoing conversation in my family about birth order.
[128.10 --> 132.46]  You see, we're in a family of five boys and no girls, and I know every time we say that,
[132.52 --> 133.58]  people will say, you're a poor mother.
[133.58 --> 141.34]  But Sean's the dead center middle child, and he will always say that he is the, quote, neglected middle.
[142.10 --> 144.00]  Are there any other neglected middles here?
[144.78 --> 146.34]  Okay, we've got some middles.
[146.72 --> 147.80]  They've all done the therapy.
[148.04 --> 148.88]  They know it's okay.
[148.88 --> 155.30]  But I've always said to Sean that if he's the neglected middle, I am the forgotten fourth.
[155.92 --> 156.14]  Right?
[156.46 --> 164.32]  You're further down the batting order of children in the family, but you do not have the privileges and the protection of the prize youngest child.
[165.08 --> 167.32]  And if you're a youngest here, just embrace that.
[167.58 --> 168.88]  Don't try to argue with us.
[169.06 --> 170.82]  We know you're the prize child, okay?
[170.98 --> 172.72]  It's not contestable or debatable.
[172.72 --> 179.60]  I want to suggest that Jude is the forgotten fourth of the New Testament family.
[180.52 --> 186.16]  It's the kind of book you accidentally go right over on your way to the prize book of Revelation.
[186.34 --> 187.00]  Tell me I'm wrong.
[187.48 --> 189.02]  Most people can't even find it.
[189.08 --> 191.22]  And when you find it, you're like, oh, I didn't know that book was there.
[191.68 --> 194.46]  And then once you read it, you're like, what is this book all about?
[194.88 --> 199.50]  And I just want to say at the outset of this series that Jude is a complicated book.
[199.50 --> 204.84]  Even a commentator who wrote a huge commentary on this book said in the introduction,
[205.38 --> 209.88]  people can read this book and get the first part and the last part and the whole middle part,
[209.94 --> 216.48]  which we're getting into next week, is a jumbled mess of Old Testament images and confusing dark metaphors.
[216.74 --> 218.28]  So we're going to go into this together.
[218.44 --> 220.38]  And if you're confused by it, don't worry.
[220.64 --> 223.32]  It'll get clearer as we preach through it and study it together.
[224.84 --> 226.76]  But Jude is in the Bible for a reason.
[226.76 --> 229.60]  There's a reason this book is here.
[230.50 --> 237.12]  In fact, I would summarize in some sense that Jude is this really strong word to the church then and the church today.
[237.62 --> 239.96]  Because in a world where there's like consumer religion,
[240.30 --> 244.68]  where you can sort of pick pieces of the Christian faith and decide for yourself what you believe,
[245.04 --> 248.00]  pick pieces of how you want to live and sort of make your own religion up,
[248.08 --> 249.46]  Jude says truth matters.
[250.78 --> 252.14]  How you live matters.
[252.14 --> 257.48]  False teaching has consequences, especially for leaders.
[259.38 --> 261.96]  One scholar on this book of Jude summarizes it this way.
[262.02 --> 263.40]  His name is Dr. Nijay Gupta.
[264.44 --> 265.90]  And this is what he writes very simply.
[266.04 --> 271.42]  Jude wrote this letter to help the church to authenticate true Christianity.
[272.14 --> 277.02]  Over and against, of course, false teaching and corrupt leadership, as you're going to see in just a minute.
[277.02 --> 282.68]  So today what we're going to do, I'm going to do my very best to make sense of this book with us as we enter into it.
[282.90 --> 285.48]  Give some overview and important background on it.
[285.56 --> 288.38]  And next week we're going to go deeper into the issue of false teaching.
[288.72 --> 294.08]  And the week after that we're going to go deeper into the issue of contending for and persevering in the faith
[294.08 --> 296.00]  in a world where there's many religious options
[296.00 --> 299.20]  and a culture where there's many different ways of understanding Christian faith.
[299.82 --> 300.30]  Sound good?
[300.30 --> 302.60]  All right, first things first.
[303.24 --> 305.30]  Who wrote the book of Jude?
[306.00 --> 308.42]  And you see in the very first verse that he names himself.
[308.56 --> 312.88]  He says, Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James.
[314.02 --> 320.06]  Now you should know that Jude is as common in the first century as the name Michael and James or Patricia.
[320.32 --> 321.08]  I wrote these down.
[321.32 --> 325.62]  I did not know that Mary, Mary and Patricia are the two most common names.
[325.72 --> 326.26]  Did you know that?
[326.90 --> 328.36]  I don't even know any Patricias.
[328.36 --> 329.58]  How is that even possible?
[330.30 --> 333.80]  But because it's very common, there's different takes on who could have wrote this book.
[333.98 --> 338.58]  Most people agree that the Jude who wrote this book is the brother of Jesus.
[340.20 --> 341.26]  I don't know if you know this.
[341.32 --> 344.22]  If you're new to Christian faith, Jesus has four younger brothers.
[344.76 --> 348.52]  James, who's named here, Joseph, Simon, and Jude.
[348.88 --> 351.66]  And if you want to talk about birth order, imagine being the brother of Jesus.
[352.28 --> 352.56]  Right?
[352.62 --> 354.80]  The shadow you live under being the brother of Jesus.
[354.86 --> 355.68]  That's a big shadow.
[355.68 --> 363.74]  And another fascinating detail is from what we know, these brothers aren't really part of Jesus' discipleship journey until after his resurrection.
[364.36 --> 365.82]  And we don't know all the details.
[365.88 --> 366.70]  They're not given to us.
[366.86 --> 371.94]  But there's a very good chance that they did not come to faith in Jesus until after his resurrection.
[371.94 --> 374.58]  And in some sense, that might be weird.
[374.72 --> 376.52]  But in other sense, it's like that kind of checks out.
[376.62 --> 376.78]  Right?
[377.20 --> 382.88]  Your brother is going to be the last one to believe you about the giant claims you make about yourself until there's some proof.
[383.06 --> 387.60]  And once they saw that proof, once they saw Jesus resurrected, these guys were leaders in the church.
[387.60 --> 395.22]  They're writing letters to the churches because they are passionately following Jesus Christ, who's not just their brother, but he's their Lord and their Savior.
[396.84 --> 399.14]  So this book is organized fairly simply.
[399.30 --> 401.24]  A lot of the letters in the New Testament are written this way.
[401.32 --> 404.72]  But here's the structure if you're one of those people who likes to know what you're getting into.
[404.82 --> 406.06]  There's a greeting which we read.
[406.44 --> 407.26]  He gives the purpose.
[407.52 --> 408.56]  Here's why I'm writing it.
[408.92 --> 414.40]  For most of the book, he gives his accusations against these false teachers and corrupt leaders.
[414.40 --> 418.38]  And then there's this invitation for the church to be faithful and persevere.
[418.72 --> 421.62]  And then he gives a closing prayer, which I'm going to read later in the service.
[422.80 --> 424.12]  But now we get to the heart of it.
[424.52 --> 427.98]  Why did Jude write this tiny little letter?
[428.60 --> 429.44]  Why is it here?
[430.08 --> 436.12]  And I'll read again some words starting in verse 3 where I want you to listen to this and see if you can detect what's the purpose of this letter.
[436.56 --> 437.90]  And I'm going to start in verse 3 here.
[438.42 --> 439.10]  He writes,
[439.10 --> 469.08]  Now the first thing I want to point out is this is not the letter that Jude wants.
[469.08 --> 470.14]  He wanted to write about.
[470.58 --> 473.34]  He wanted to encourage them about the faith they shared.
[473.44 --> 475.72]  But he saw some serious stuff going on in the church.
[475.88 --> 479.08]  And he's like, this is what I have to write about.
[479.70 --> 481.40]  He saw that the church was under attack.
[481.50 --> 483.46]  And the church is under attack in only two ways.
[483.54 --> 486.06]  One is persecution and pressure from the outside world.
[486.24 --> 488.32]  And there were churches in the New Testament that faced that.
[488.58 --> 494.86]  But the other one throughout church history is false teachers and corrupt leaders within the church.
[494.86 --> 497.90]  And that is what Jude is dealing with.
[498.32 --> 503.30]  So fired up as he is about this that he writes this whole letter to address it.
[504.14 --> 510.72]  He says there are certain people who slipped into the church that have sort of ingratiated themselves into the community.
[510.96 --> 513.08]  They clearly had a lot of influence.
[513.22 --> 514.66]  Otherwise, Jude wouldn't be that concerned.
[515.22 --> 516.96]  Likely holding positions of leadership.
[516.96 --> 519.70]  And Jude is like, we need to deal with this.
[519.86 --> 521.58]  And the church needs to face this.
[521.70 --> 523.58]  Otherwise, it will lead the whole church astray.
[524.14 --> 525.58]  And here's his accusation.
[525.74 --> 528.88]  Two key accusations against these false leaders.
[529.44 --> 531.84]  Number one, they are ungodly.
[532.36 --> 535.80]  They pervert the grace of our God into a license to do whatever they want.
[536.12 --> 536.56]  Immorality.
[537.30 --> 541.44]  Number two, they are reducing the significance of Jesus.
[542.24 --> 544.42]  So I'm just going to take a look at both of these in turn.
[544.52 --> 546.24]  Number one, immoral living.
[547.72 --> 550.34]  This is really interesting about the whole book of Jude in general.
[550.80 --> 556.00]  He talks about these false teachers, but he barely talks about the content of their teaching.
[556.46 --> 559.02]  What he goes after is their conduct.
[559.62 --> 561.08]  And for Jude, those things are tied together.
[561.08 --> 564.28]  Like you can see what someone believes by how they live.
[564.74 --> 568.90]  And he says these people are not living in the way of Jesus.
[569.76 --> 570.84]  There is immorality.
[570.96 --> 573.48]  And you'll see next week we're going to look at the greed of the leaders in the church,
[573.62 --> 575.74]  the sexual immorality of the leaders in the church.
[575.88 --> 578.06]  And it's not that they've got issues that they're dealing with.
[578.24 --> 579.40]  Everyone in the church does.
[579.74 --> 584.54]  But these guys are like flagrantly flaunting a certain lifestyle.
[585.04 --> 588.32]  They are flagrantly showing off this sense of freedom they have.
[588.64 --> 592.72]  And if you're here two weeks ago, this is very similar to the Corinthian church.
[593.24 --> 595.66]  They believe the sense of like, hey, Jesus set us free.
[596.38 --> 597.56]  We have new freedom.
[597.56 --> 599.26]  He's forgiven us for all we've done.
[599.46 --> 602.26]  We can do whatever we want.
[602.96 --> 603.54]  We're free.
[604.16 --> 608.08]  And Jude is saying if that's freedom, you've misunderstood freedom.
[609.60 --> 613.04]  Secondly, he then goes to say they have reduced the significance of Jesus.
[613.14 --> 614.52]  Now this is a big deal, right?
[614.80 --> 618.84]  Christianity hangs on whether Jesus is who he says he is or he isn't.
[619.06 --> 622.38]  And he's like these people are reducing the significance of Jesus.
[622.38 --> 626.82]  And I want to suggest to you there's three different ways that they could be saying this.
[626.90 --> 630.28]  And I'll give you all three and then my opinion on which of them I think it is.
[630.42 --> 632.24]  Because you can deny Jesus in different ways.
[632.90 --> 634.00]  So the first is this.
[634.40 --> 638.56]  They deny Jesus in his significance, his uniqueness.
[638.84 --> 640.18]  They're denying the uniqueness of Jesus.
[640.28 --> 643.66]  That is to say Jesus is one religious option among many.
[644.14 --> 645.68]  There's many sources of salvation.
[645.88 --> 648.16]  There's many gods that people worshipped in the first century.
[648.16 --> 650.44]  Jesus is not that big of a deal.
[651.48 --> 655.28]  Secondly, they could be denying the humanity of Jesus.
[656.08 --> 657.78]  I mentioned this a couple weeks ago.
[657.94 --> 661.78]  But first century people often thought that the body was made up of two things.
[662.26 --> 664.06]  There's the soul which mattered a lot.
[664.18 --> 665.88]  Sort of the thing inside of you that's eternal.
[666.20 --> 668.66]  And then there's the flesh which didn't matter.
[668.76 --> 671.72]  Sort of the shell that was evil and material and didn't matter.
[672.14 --> 673.90]  And there's a good chance that these leaders were saying,
[674.02 --> 676.10]  Hey, the body doesn't matter that much.
[676.10 --> 678.18]  Jesus wasn't actually fully human.
[678.34 --> 680.56]  He was just kind of a God represented in a body.
[680.94 --> 684.42]  And that's a pretty big deal because if Jesus wasn't fully human,
[684.62 --> 689.16]  then the salvation we have through the cross wasn't for us as fully human.
[690.04 --> 695.46]  And then the third option is simply that Jesus or these false teachers were denying Jesus authority.
[696.12 --> 696.44]  Right?
[696.88 --> 699.50]  If there's a disciple who says, Hey, I want to follow Jesus,
[699.62 --> 701.76]  but there's nothing in their lives that show evidence of that,
[701.98 --> 704.38]  then people can say, Well, are you really following the authority of Jesus?
[704.38 --> 705.84]  Is he really the Lord of your life?
[705.84 --> 708.36]  Because you're living this kind of way, there's an incongruence there.
[709.08 --> 711.76]  Now, I want to suggest that that third one is true no matter what.
[711.94 --> 713.74]  Like Jude says that elsewhere in his letter.
[714.16 --> 716.02]  And if I had to guess which of these was the case,
[716.38 --> 719.44]  it's probably that these teachers are saying Jesus was not fully human.
[719.86 --> 721.74]  He was sort of a God who might have been represented,
[721.98 --> 723.28]  but he's not a fully human person.
[724.30 --> 728.66]  And so Jude then says, This is how you as a church have to respond.
[728.88 --> 732.38]  You've got these corrupt leaders living a certain way, giving false teaching.
[732.38 --> 734.08]  This is what the church has to do.
[734.20 --> 735.34]  I'll read verse 3 again.
[737.20 --> 741.58]  He writes, I feel compelled to write and urge you to what?
[742.88 --> 748.14]  Contend for the faith that the Lord has once entrusted to all of us as people.
[748.60 --> 749.80]  That's what he says to the church.
[750.58 --> 751.96]  Contend for the faith.
[752.70 --> 754.16]  Now, if you had different translations,
[754.88 --> 757.04]  you'll notice maybe even when you go home and read it,
[757.48 --> 759.22]  that there's different ways that this is written.
[759.22 --> 762.88]  It could be contend, could be fight for the faith,
[763.10 --> 766.14]  could be defend the faith, stand up for the faith.
[766.32 --> 769.42]  The point is, there's some serious stuff going on in leadership.
[770.28 --> 772.20]  And there's a sense in which the church has to stand up
[772.20 --> 774.70]  and make sure it's known that that is not the way of Jesus.
[775.32 --> 776.62]  That's not the way of discipleship.
[778.06 --> 779.96]  And there's many ways I can tease it out,
[779.98 --> 781.52]  but let me read for us verse 20 and following,
[781.62 --> 782.72]  where I think Jude himself says,
[782.80 --> 784.18]  This is what it means to contend for the faith.
[784.24 --> 785.32]  I don't think it's really important.
[785.32 --> 786.28]  He writes,
[786.74 --> 801.60]  Can I highlight two things here?
[802.78 --> 805.02]  There's conflict in the church, right?
[805.08 --> 806.28]  There's division in this church.
[806.82 --> 808.08]  And what Jude says here, number one,
[808.30 --> 812.88]  is prayer is central to contending for the faith.
[812.88 --> 815.04]  I've been in the church for a little while,
[815.10 --> 816.28]  as many of you have as well.
[816.78 --> 822.36]  And you probably know that sometimes conflict can be so unrooted in prayer and love.
[822.40 --> 824.98]  And I'm convinced that the way that we go into difficult conversations,
[825.56 --> 826.74]  difficult confrontations,
[826.86 --> 829.22]  is first and foremost at the feet of Christ in prayer.
[829.70 --> 831.62]  That's where you gain a love for somebody.
[832.04 --> 835.76]  That's where you gain the compassion and the wisdom to speak truth in love,
[835.80 --> 838.40]  rather than in a way that's going to cause division and more discord.
[838.40 --> 845.00]  Secondly, the idea of keeping ourselves in God's love is living the way God designed us to live.
[845.48 --> 847.24]  He's really, in no short way of saying,
[847.60 --> 850.70]  You guys have to find out the way that Jesus has invited you to live
[850.70 --> 852.44]  and stay there together,
[852.96 --> 857.06]  modeling the way he has called you to live as a way of confronting this false teaching.
[857.14 --> 859.58]  I think that stuff is so key and so critical.
[859.58 --> 865.26]  I mentioned the scholar at the beginning who summarizes the book of Jude.
[865.36 --> 866.60]  I'm struck by how he says,
[867.02 --> 871.16]  His way of understanding Jude is to be gentle with those who are sorting out the faith,
[871.74 --> 874.88]  who are doubting and sort of making sense of what Jesus is all about,
[875.16 --> 879.00]  but being very firm and firm on the teaching of Christ
[879.00 --> 880.82]  with those who are dividing the church,
[881.16 --> 883.42]  taking positions of authority and abusing it.
[883.42 --> 888.70]  So that's as far as I'm going to go in terms of overviewing the message of Jude
[888.70 --> 890.44]  because I know Pastor Sid is here,
[890.56 --> 892.84]  and he hates it when I steal his message from next week.
[892.94 --> 894.84]  So wherever you are, Sid, you're welcome.
[895.64 --> 897.04]  He does this to me all the time, by the way.
[897.10 --> 900.40]  When I preach after him, he steals my sermon and preaches right before me.
[900.44 --> 901.36]  So I'm not going to do that.
[901.62 --> 903.06]  I'm going to leave next week for him.
[903.28 --> 906.26]  But I'm going to give us just a few minutes of like big picture.
[906.82 --> 909.38]  What does this book of Jude have for the church today?
[909.38 --> 918.16]  Okay, first thing that comes to me as I study this book is how fragile the church is, right?
[919.14 --> 922.14]  The church family is a fragile family.
[922.52 --> 924.58]  In fact, it's just like all of our families.
[924.70 --> 927.52]  It doesn't take a lot to divide your family, does it?
[928.28 --> 931.48]  And if you disagree with me, I'd invite you to rewind by two years.
[931.58 --> 932.58]  Remember this thing called COVID?
[933.46 --> 934.28]  No, you don't remember that?
[934.32 --> 935.56]  You've just repressed those memories.
[936.02 --> 938.20]  For a while, you couldn't eat with your families.
[938.20 --> 940.86]  And then when you could, you didn't know if you wanted to, right?
[941.20 --> 942.16]  It was tough.
[942.30 --> 943.78]  And a lot of people were divided.
[943.98 --> 945.26]  And some people had strong opinions.
[945.26 --> 946.32]  And they read certain articles.
[946.44 --> 948.08]  And then all of a sudden, there's like major conflict.
[949.06 --> 951.34]  It doesn't take much to divide the church.
[951.60 --> 958.42]  In the case of this church, it's a few key leaders with a few bad pieces of teaching and bad lifestyle.
[958.42 --> 960.58]  And they're wreaking havoc in the church.
[961.22 --> 962.16]  It doesn't take much.
[962.16 --> 970.12]  And Jude is calling the leaders of the church who are faithful to the hard work of standing against that for the sake of the whole body.
[971.08 --> 972.24]  And that's very hard to do then.
[972.36 --> 974.12]  And I will add, it's very hard to do now.
[974.32 --> 978.66]  In postmodern British Columbia, where we have high thresholds of tolerance for disagreement,
[979.02 --> 982.66]  it's very hard for us to say, hey, this is not in line with the way of Jesus.
[982.76 --> 984.02]  And we have to talk about it.
[984.02 --> 989.66]  But secondly, I want to loop back to that connection between false teaching and immoral living.
[990.24 --> 996.22]  It's fascinating to me how Jude's main concern is not necessarily the content of all the things that these people are saying.
[996.40 --> 997.34]  It's how they're living.
[998.18 --> 1004.08]  Because that reveals to Jude and to the rest of the church that these people can't be trusted.
[1006.04 --> 1007.86]  Character is critical for Jude.
[1007.96 --> 1011.10]  And it's true, just as true now as it is for that church then.
[1011.10 --> 1016.74]  Because we still have the temptation to be wooed by someone's eloquence, the charisma,
[1017.38 --> 1023.10]  their ability to be persuasive in conversation and relational abilities rather than their character.
[1023.62 --> 1026.12]  And when I say character, I mean like the basics of the fruit of the Spirit.
[1026.30 --> 1034.48]  Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, self-control.
[1034.62 --> 1036.32]  These things are so critical.
[1036.32 --> 1043.06]  And yet, we can so quickly overlook them because we're wooed by these competent skills that people have.
[1043.22 --> 1044.86]  This happens in the church all the time.
[1045.50 --> 1050.82]  And usually, if you hear a story of abuse of power or toxic leaders in the church,
[1051.16 --> 1057.24]  there is a story in their background of people being wooed by the gifts and overlooking the weaknesses of character.
[1057.24 --> 1061.20]  And there are many people, it's a nervous thing to say this when you're a pastor yourself,
[1061.28 --> 1067.44]  but there are many people who are given a very huge platform who do not have the character for it.
[1068.26 --> 1073.28]  And it breaks my heart to see so many stories of abuse of power in the church because people have overlooked character.
[1074.24 --> 1079.54]  Now, I'm going to share a story about our youth pastor, Misha, because it's very fitting for this moment.
[1079.54 --> 1084.64]  But over COVID, when we were looking for a youth pastor, we had a lot of applicants.
[1085.04 --> 1087.36]  And some of you are here, you're on our hiring team.
[1087.44 --> 1088.28]  You might remember this.
[1088.56 --> 1092.46]  And we had, I don't know, 20-something applicants at the beginning, and we interviewed eight of them.
[1092.88 --> 1094.78]  And all of them were like, ah, these aren't great.
[1094.90 --> 1095.46]  We'll just wait.
[1095.50 --> 1096.94]  And we didn't hire any of those applicants.
[1097.06 --> 1101.88]  And then we came back to another set of interviews, and we had another huge set of people who applied.
[1102.00 --> 1104.02]  And we did another round of interviews all over Zoom.
[1104.02 --> 1111.96]  And what I remember so clearly is there were some strong candidates, like on paper, and like very articulate, very charismatic.
[1112.28 --> 1114.34]  They would be like, they have all the checkboxes.
[1114.46 --> 1119.40]  But there was a sense that we had as a team, like, hmm, there's something about the character of this candidate.
[1120.02 --> 1121.16]  There's a bit of pride here.
[1121.22 --> 1124.36]  It's like, I don't know if this person can really work on a team and be humble.
[1124.68 --> 1126.50]  And as a team, we said, no, let's not hire them.
[1126.78 --> 1127.80]  And then, where's Misha?
[1127.94 --> 1128.24]  Is she here?
[1128.30 --> 1129.38]  Oh, she's upstairs in launch.
[1129.68 --> 1130.90]  Now, I'm talking behind her back.
[1130.90 --> 1138.74]  Like, I remember so vividly, as does the rest of the team, Misha was sharing about her own patterns of her devotion life,
[1138.98 --> 1142.80]  how she's seeking to follow Jesus in the season of COVID with her family and her friends.
[1143.08 --> 1146.84]  And she just shared these things like, whoa, this woman loves the Lord.
[1147.44 --> 1153.10]  And in her ordinary life, she's seeking to be a disciple, not chasing after a platform, not chasing after authority,
[1153.10 --> 1156.46]  but she wants to serve with her gifts, and she's well-formed in the way of Jesus.
[1157.06 --> 1158.10]  And she's the one we hired.
[1158.10 --> 1162.04]  All that to say, character is critical.
[1162.44 --> 1167.60]  And Jude here, I want to say this as clear as I can, his message to every church then and now
[1167.60 --> 1174.62]  is to be very serious about the teaching of people and the behavior of people.
[1175.22 --> 1177.32]  Doctrine and life both are critical.
[1178.94 --> 1182.96]  And so at this point, I think it's worth pausing and just celebrating and giving thanks to God
[1182.96 --> 1186.62]  for the leaders in our church, the elders and deacons of our church.
[1186.62 --> 1189.92]  We're in a beautiful season of unity and peace around our leadership table.
[1190.30 --> 1190.94]  Some of you are here.
[1191.06 --> 1192.24]  James was leading our prayer.
[1192.88 --> 1197.66]  God's been good to us, and he's answered a lot of prayer about the character and the conduct of our leaders.
[1198.44 --> 1202.80]  And many of you might not know this, but for the last year plus, we've been reading
[1202.80 --> 1206.94]  and having special meetings together just to talk about spiritual formation.
[1206.94 --> 1210.92]  Not for the church in general, although that's true, but for us as leaders.
[1211.40 --> 1214.08]  And many leaders have now written out what's called a rule of life.
[1214.48 --> 1218.48]  And that language is just, it's old language, and it basically says, I'm going to take these practices,
[1218.98 --> 1222.88]  whether it's scripture reading, it's giving, it's hospitality, it's prayer,
[1222.96 --> 1228.04]  and I'm going to put those on my calendar and then become accountable to those, to other leaders in the church.
[1228.50 --> 1229.50]  And I think that's beautiful.
[1229.50 --> 1233.70]  And I can already see in some of the leaders in our church how that's producing fruit
[1233.70 --> 1238.28]  and allows us to say to our church body, come follow us as we follow Jesus.
[1239.02 --> 1242.68]  Allow our own lives to be a model of how we believe discipleship looks.
[1243.02 --> 1244.16]  We don't just want platform.
[1244.60 --> 1246.90]  We want character that invites people to follow Jesus.
[1247.16 --> 1252.86]  And let me just say as clearly as I can, what invites people to follow Jesus is your character.
[1252.86 --> 1256.06]  It's the way you live in your ordinary day.
[1256.92 --> 1260.74]  It's the normal moments of hospitality in your home, of time with your friends.
[1261.12 --> 1266.30]  It's the ordinary stuff that shows the love and the beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1267.64 --> 1273.12]  And I will just say, you have leaders, church, that love Jesus, and they love the church.
[1274.58 --> 1277.52]  But for the next few minutes, I want to talk about contending for the faith.
[1277.52 --> 1285.28]  This might sound like a strange first place to go, but this is in my own wrestling as I think about what it means to be the church today,
[1286.18 --> 1287.96]  how contending for the faith looks.
[1288.08 --> 1294.96]  First, I think it requires us having a sense of what we believe clear in our own hearts and minds, right?
[1295.14 --> 1301.34]  It's hard to fight for something and stand for something that is confusing and maybe uncertain in your own heart and mind.
[1301.34 --> 1306.60]  And I know that for many of us, there's some new believers in our church, people who are just starting their journey of faith.
[1306.60 --> 1312.24]  And it's hard to sort of get clear, like, okay, what is the gospel versus what I heard this person say it was?
[1312.44 --> 1317.34]  What does it mean to be a disciple versus what I've read here or what my family said about it that doesn't go to church?
[1317.48 --> 1324.92]  And there's a sense of, like, you want to gain some clarity on what it is you believe and how to follow Jesus with every sphere of your life
[1324.92 --> 1327.18]  in order to then contend for the faith.
[1327.18 --> 1336.92]  And I would even say this, it's dangerous if you try to, quote, unquote, fight for the faith when you do not have clarity about what the gospel is all about.
[1338.10 --> 1339.82]  And this is a bit of a sidebar.
[1340.60 --> 1348.10]  But when I say fight for the faith, the last thing I want you to hear is street preacher, right, with a bullhorn, arguing with people.
[1348.44 --> 1352.84]  Every now and then on, like, my video feed on social media, I'll see these videos and it just kills me.
[1352.84 --> 1360.06]  And it's not that they don't have good hearts, but it's like, do you really think that arguing with strangers is the way to invite them to the way of Jesus
[1360.06 --> 1364.52]  rather than hospitality, conversation, friendship, and all the rest?
[1364.70 --> 1370.02]  Now, God uses it in his own way sometimes, but that is not what I think contending for the faith is first and foremost.
[1371.78 --> 1374.94]  Malcolm X, maybe you know who that is, famously put it this way.
[1375.00 --> 1379.36]  He says, if you do not stand for something, you'll fall for anything.
[1379.36 --> 1388.18]  And I know that there's a fear among many Christians, and I'm sure even in this room, of a coworker or a friend or someone on public transit saying,
[1388.28 --> 1391.96]  hey, wait a minute, why do you Christians believe that when there's this other religion who does this?
[1391.98 --> 1394.66]  Or why would you follow Jesus when this is the abuse happening in the church?
[1394.80 --> 1400.52]  And you have a fear of people asking these hard questions because you're not sure what you'd want to say or how to say it well.
[1400.52 --> 1411.94]  And because of that, it seems to me that the invitation to contend for the faith for the church then is an invitation for us today to go deeper in our faith.
[1412.80 --> 1413.18]  Right?
[1413.38 --> 1418.86]  And that doesn't mean becoming the smartest person in the room on all the topics, but it does mean reading the scriptures.
[1420.02 --> 1423.44]  Having a sense of being able to say why you believe what you believe.
[1423.44 --> 1427.76]  Sharing what it is that the gospel really is and why it's good news to you.
[1427.84 --> 1431.30]  Not just a source of argument, but it's actually good news for you and for the world.
[1431.94 --> 1438.12]  And then being able to stand against the heresy, the false teaching.
[1438.12 --> 1444.46]  And I will say, like, one fascinating connection between then and now, the heresy of the church then is,
[1444.52 --> 1446.58]  you've got these teachers who are saying, hey, we're free in Jesus.
[1446.84 --> 1448.34]  We're free to do whatever we want.
[1448.42 --> 1451.80]  We're free to engage in sexual immorality and greed and all the rest.
[1451.94 --> 1454.98]  And trust me, that's still the case in the church.
[1455.30 --> 1455.56]  Right?
[1456.02 --> 1457.14]  I'll just ask for forgiveness.
[1457.62 --> 1458.72]  Jesus is good with this.
[1458.92 --> 1460.76]  There's not a distinct lifestyle of Christians.
[1461.18 --> 1463.68]  That heresy still needs to be confronted by the church today.
[1463.80 --> 1467.18]  Not just with our words, but with our lives.
[1467.70 --> 1467.90]  Right?
[1468.90 --> 1475.90]  Embodying the way of Jesus as a way of showing the right way of discipleship and what the gospel looks like in real, ordinary life.
[1477.92 --> 1482.26]  I want to finish with this comment that's been stirring in my head the last couple days particularly.
[1483.00 --> 1487.38]  I have a lot of patience for the mess of the church in the book of Jude.
[1487.50 --> 1489.04]  Like, it's a pretty messy situation.
[1489.46 --> 1494.16]  Imagine a small house church with very powerful, toxic, and divisive leaders.
[1494.48 --> 1495.74]  That's a tough situation.
[1495.74 --> 1503.74]  But what makes me patient with them is that when they were gathering for worship and discipleship and all the rest, they didn't even have this.
[1504.74 --> 1506.28]  Like, this bound Bible.
[1506.28 --> 1509.96]  They had, like, scrolls and letters that they were sharing with other house churches.
[1510.28 --> 1515.18]  They had friends who were trying to communicate what they thought was being written by Peter and James and all the rest.
[1515.42 --> 1517.84]  Like, it was a very young stage of the church.
[1517.84 --> 1523.12]  And they would have been so jealous of us having a bound Bible.
[1523.84 --> 1533.08]  Much less thousands of years of faithful Christian leaders writing out the content of the Christian faith.
[1533.08 --> 1543.72]  We have creeds and confessions and written documents from the church for the last 2,000 years that are such a gift to us.
[1543.72 --> 1551.02]  You might not know this, but most of the creeds of the church, which might sound dull to you, those were written for the sake of the church.
[1551.48 --> 1553.68]  To defend it against one heresy or another.
[1553.80 --> 1560.02]  And you should know that most modern heresies, false teachings, are just repackaging of old heresies and new clothes.
[1560.40 --> 1561.32]  Trust me on that one.
[1561.52 --> 1563.24]  There's not that much new under the sun.
[1563.24 --> 1571.48]  And if you want to know a giant red flag for me, it's whenever someone in the church will say, you know, I've been reading the Bible by myself.
[1571.78 --> 1579.50]  And I've come up with this amazing new idea that no other Christian has ever thought of that revolutionizes everything we think about the church and Jesus.
[1579.60 --> 1580.32]  I'm like, wait a minute.
[1580.68 --> 1584.74]  We've got, like, thousands of years of really smart people who have studied the Bible.
[1585.02 --> 1586.26]  Have you consulted them?
[1586.38 --> 1588.96]  And if they have and they've done the work, I'd listen to it.
[1588.96 --> 1594.46]  But that's, like, a red flag of, like, maybe you should just be a little more humble about this brand new idea that's probably not true.
[1595.24 --> 1597.04]  Especially if you're reading Revelation by yourself.
[1597.54 --> 1598.30]  Tell me I'm wrong.
[1599.18 --> 1602.18]  If you grew up in the church, Revelation is, like, this super divisive book.
[1602.44 --> 1605.18]  And it needs a lot of people reading it carefully together.
[1607.06 --> 1610.00]  Because of this, we're going to finish this sermon in a strange kind of way.
[1610.88 --> 1613.72]  And I want to introduce, so we're going to read the Apostles' Creed together.
[1614.28 --> 1615.60]  If you grew up in the church, maybe you did that.
[1615.64 --> 1618.20]  If you didn't, this is sort of this weird moment where everyone's going to chant.
[1618.20 --> 1619.06]  And it's okay.
[1620.10 --> 1622.60]  I remember someone saying, I don't like the chanting church.
[1622.64 --> 1623.62]  It's like we chant together.
[1623.90 --> 1624.58]  But here's why.
[1624.84 --> 1629.78]  This is the earliest, most unifying statement of faith that exists in the church.
[1630.86 --> 1634.94]  Millions of believers today, as they gather, will be reciting this with us.
[1635.58 --> 1636.86]  Two more things you need to know.
[1637.50 --> 1643.58]  One, it was first penned, at least portions of it, to help people as they prepare for baptism.
[1644.08 --> 1647.66]  As sort of, like, this is a summary of the core of the Christian faith.
[1647.66 --> 1653.64]  And so we're reading something that has been used to disciple believers for thousands of years and around the world.
[1653.86 --> 1655.94]  I don't know about you, but that's very beautiful to me.
[1656.42 --> 1657.98]  Secondly, a lot more sobering.
[1659.20 --> 1664.36]  Christians around the world and throughout history have died for what they say with these words.
[1664.36 --> 1671.42]  Many Christians have been killed and been forced to say, like, either take this back, your commitment to Jesus, or we will take your life.
[1671.50 --> 1678.12]  And they chose to have their life taken because they believe that everything about Jesus written here is the core of the Christian faith.
[1679.24 --> 1683.62]  And the last thing I'll say before we read it, I get this question every time we read the Creed.
[1683.62 --> 1688.36]  That word Catholic there with a lower C and an asterisk, my daughter asked about that yesterday.
[1688.58 --> 1689.04]  She's not here.
[1689.66 --> 1691.54]  That just means Christians everywhere.
[1692.14 --> 1694.62]  The Catholic with a capital C is the Roman Catholic Church.
[1694.74 --> 1699.00]  Capital or small c means it's all your believers around the world and throughout history.
[1699.46 --> 1702.28]  And this is going to be a creed where we recite, where we take our stand.
[1702.42 --> 1703.60]  So would you stand with me?
[1704.28 --> 1705.32]  I can invite the worship team.
[1705.38 --> 1706.96]  They're going to lead us in worship as we sing this.
[1706.96 --> 1715.62]  I'll start us off and then you can join with me in this reciting of the most unifying document other than the Bible in the church.
[1716.18 --> 1716.98]  Let's say it together.
[1717.10 --> 1718.12]  I believe in God.
[1718.12 --> 1718.16]  I believe in God.
