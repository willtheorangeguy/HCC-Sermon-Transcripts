[0.00 --> 17.70]  Well, it's a new ministry season, and we're starting a new sermon series.
[18.18 --> 21.30]  And the name of this series is called Contrast Community.
[22.08 --> 26.24]  For the next number of weeks, we're going to be looking at the way in which we are called
[26.24 --> 30.68]  to live distinctively as the body of Christ in the midst of our city.
[31.04 --> 34.22]  We're going to open up some of the ways that are normal for people to live in our city
[34.22 --> 38.86]  and just the unique ways that Christ calls us to bear witness to Him and live a unique
[38.86 --> 41.94]  kind of discipleship lifestyle in the midst of our world.
[43.02 --> 47.14]  A quote that is sort of percolating in my mind for this series actually comes from Leslie
[47.14 --> 49.52]  Newbigin, but he says, as a missionary, he says,
[49.52 --> 55.30]  The church is called to love this city so deeply that it stands against the idols.
[56.24 --> 59.58]  And so in this series, we're going to look at what it means for us to be a community
[59.58 --> 66.26]  of rest in a world of hurry and anxiousness, what it means to be a community of generosity
[66.26 --> 71.18]  in a world of greed, what it means to be a community of upright speech in a world of cheap
[71.18 --> 74.16]  talk and gossip, and many more things like this.
[74.98 --> 78.92]  This morning, we're going to look at what it means to be a community of sacrificial service
[78.92 --> 80.96]  in a world of self-elevation.
[81.60 --> 85.88]  And if you have your Bible, I do invite you to turn with me to Matthew chapter 20, where
[85.88 --> 90.00]  we're going to read a story of an ambitious mother who makes a very interesting request
[90.00 --> 90.62]  of Jesus.
[92.04 --> 94.44]  This is Matthew 20, starting in verse 20.
[96.94 --> 103.36]  Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and kneeling down, asked
[103.36 --> 104.24]  a favor of him.
[105.00 --> 106.20]  What is it you want?
[106.38 --> 106.94]  He asked.
[107.74 --> 112.90]  She said, Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other
[112.90 --> 114.60]  at your left in your kingdom.
[115.70 --> 118.52]  You do not know what you're asking, Jesus said to them.
[119.08 --> 121.84]  Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink?
[122.66 --> 124.18]  We can, they answered.
[125.22 --> 129.80]  Jesus said to them, you will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right and left
[129.80 --> 131.18]  is not for me to grant.
[131.64 --> 135.60]  These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my father.
[136.54 --> 140.02]  When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.
[140.02 --> 145.80]  Jesus called them together and said, you know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over
[145.80 --> 149.24]  them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
[149.84 --> 151.80]  Not so with you.
[152.48 --> 157.08]  Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and those who want
[157.08 --> 159.40]  to be first must be your slave.
[159.68 --> 165.60]  Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and give his life as a ransom
[165.60 --> 166.68]  for many.
[166.68 --> 168.34]  This is God's word.
[168.34 --> 172.34]  God's word.
[172.34 --> 176.68]  Well, one of the things that you discover when you become a parent is that there grows
[176.68 --> 179.16]  in you this ache for your kids.
[180.02 --> 184.50]  An ache to see these kids make it and succeed in the world.
[185.08 --> 188.60]  And maybe some of you, as your kids have gone back to school and experienced all the challenges
[188.60 --> 190.08]  there, and you feel that ache.
[190.16 --> 191.96]  You want your kids to do well in the world.
[191.96 --> 197.52]  And that ache for your kids drives a lot of parents to do some pretty crazy stuff so that
[197.52 --> 200.14]  their kids have a competitive advantage in the big wide world.
[200.24 --> 205.90]  Things like, you might remember this in the news, Hollywood stars bribing the way of their
[205.90 --> 208.06]  children into Ivy League schools.
[208.80 --> 211.74]  Children who would never on their own make the admission standards.
[211.74 --> 212.74]  parents.
[212.74 --> 218.88]  Or, in other cases, parents pretending to be their children in a job interview on the phone
[218.88 --> 220.82]  in order for the kid to get the job.
[221.32 --> 225.24]  And I always think that one would so backfire once the child gets the job, but different
[225.24 --> 225.60]  story.
[226.94 --> 228.34]  And there's many more like this.
[228.46 --> 232.48]  And there's also ordinary ways that most of us will try to help our kids, right?
[232.48 --> 239.42]  One of them is leveraging our network of relationships to help them find a place, find a job, with
[239.42 --> 240.00]  an opportunity.
[240.50 --> 243.24]  We sort of reach out to those we know for the sake of our kids.
[243.70 --> 247.00]  And that's kind of what's happening in our passage.
[248.10 --> 254.00]  There's an ambitious mother who comes to Jesus with a request that's for the sake of her kids.
[254.68 --> 259.38]  And we're going to learn that the request she has is that her kids experience greatness
[259.38 --> 265.28]  and prestige, and Jesus looks at her and says, I want to introduce you to the upside-down kingdom
[265.28 --> 267.68]  where the way up is through service.
[268.30 --> 270.02]  So let's take a look at this story together.
[271.28 --> 274.40]  One of the main characters is not named directly.
[274.56 --> 275.52]  I'm intrigued by this.
[275.62 --> 277.50]  It's called the mother of Zebedee's sons.
[278.06 --> 282.06]  That's like calling Brittany the mother of David's sons.
[282.54 --> 285.60]  But the name of the woman making this request is Salome.
[286.06 --> 288.28]  And she's referenced elsewhere in the Gospels.
[288.28 --> 294.18]  And interestingly, the two sons that she's making this request for are James and John.
[294.62 --> 298.56]  And if you know the disciples, they're actually on the inner circle of Jesus' disciples.
[298.70 --> 301.62]  There's the three, James, Peter, and John, and then there's the others.
[302.06 --> 305.04]  But James and John are not just on Jesus' inner circle.
[305.74 --> 307.02]  They're also his cousins.
[307.24 --> 307.82]  Did you know that?
[308.52 --> 309.46]  They're related to Jesus.
[309.78 --> 312.70]  And that makes Salome Jesus' aunt.
[312.70 --> 317.82]  And for me, that kind of shifts the way I read this story because, and maybe this is just my family,
[318.38 --> 320.88]  it would be very hard for me to say no to my aunts.
[322.02 --> 323.80]  You know, they're not the kind of people you could just say no to.
[323.88 --> 325.40]  They're powerful women in my family.
[325.80 --> 330.66]  And I wonder if, like, Salome coming to make this request just kind of changes the social dynamic for Jesus
[330.66 --> 332.14]  because she's his aunt.
[332.14 --> 335.54]  Nevertheless, this is Salome's request.
[336.18 --> 342.98]  She says, grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom.
[344.18 --> 349.80]  Now, maybe this is a strange request when you read it and you think, man, it's kind of a bold thing for her to ask Jesus.
[350.54 --> 354.02]  And I want to just underscore that there's a lot of faith built into this request.
[354.28 --> 356.26]  She believes that Jesus has authority.
[356.26 --> 360.24]  She believes that his kingdom is greater than other worldly kingdoms.
[360.44 --> 367.74]  And so she's asking for James and John to have positions of greatness, positions of prestige and authority in Jesus' kingdom.
[369.28 --> 372.64]  And Jesus' response kind of opens up a lot for her.
[373.14 --> 376.14]  But I do want to highlight one more thing that I think intrigues me about this story.
[377.48 --> 383.46]  Some people will say that she's sort of speaking for her sons, that James and John have actually put their mother up to this.
[383.46 --> 389.34]  And why people say that is if you read Mark's account of this same story, James and John make the request themselves.
[389.46 --> 397.56]  And so I had this hilarious image in my head of them sort of hiding behind their mother as she asked Jesus for them to have these prominent positions in the kingdom.
[398.34 --> 404.06]  But Jesus seems to know that the request kind of comes from them because in his dialogue, he actually addresses them directly.
[404.26 --> 406.24]  It's like, all right, thank you for that request, Salome.
[406.44 --> 409.92]  And then he turns to them and he says, I don't think you have any idea what you're asking.
[410.46 --> 411.94]  Because what does he then turn his focus to?
[411.94 --> 416.26]  He says, are you able to drink the cup that I am going to drink from?
[416.94 --> 418.04]  And you know what that reference is?
[419.00 --> 421.10]  That's the cup of suffering, right?
[421.16 --> 427.36]  When Jesus is in Gethsemane, he's about to go to the cross, he asks for his father to take that cup away from him.
[427.38 --> 429.86]  And that is the cup of judgment and suffering.
[430.40 --> 433.54]  And these two disciples, James and John, when Jesus says, are you able to do that?
[433.56 --> 436.20]  They boldly were like, yes, we can do that.
[436.20 --> 441.44]  And Jesus probably just kind of looked at himself like, I don't think they have any idea what this is all about.
[441.64 --> 443.90]  And then he gives this prophetic word over them.
[444.88 --> 454.78]  He says, you know, or sorry, he says, you will indeed drink from the cup, but it's not for me to give the position of right or left in God's kingdom when it comes.
[454.78 --> 463.06]  And I just want to highlight that these disciples might look young and brash in this passage, but Jesus' words speak truth over their futures.
[463.54 --> 466.34]  James is killed by Herod in Acts chapter 12.
[466.76 --> 468.10]  Herod puts him to death by the sword.
[468.60 --> 474.26]  And then John, he's exiled to the island of Patmos, where we get the book of Revelation, to die.
[474.26 --> 474.82]  And then John, he says, I don't know why.
[474.82 --> 477.24]  Both of them are killed for their commitment to Jesus.
[478.08 --> 486.20]  And both of them, though young and bold in this passage, learned the long, self-lowering love of Jesus in their own lives and gave up all things for Christ.
[487.52 --> 491.42]  But now I want to turn our attention to what I think is the center of this passage.
[491.52 --> 492.48]  I'm going to read it for us.
[492.72 --> 495.98]  After the other disciples get jealous, that's a funny detail as well, right?
[496.24 --> 498.10]  James and John get this request for greatness.
[498.38 --> 500.48]  The other disciples want also to have the greatness.
[500.48 --> 504.58]  And then Jesus gathers them together and gives them this very important word.
[505.10 --> 509.28]  He says, you know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them.
[510.16 --> 512.90]  And their high officials exercise authority over them.
[513.52 --> 515.70]  Not so with you.
[516.16 --> 519.38]  Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant.
[519.90 --> 522.54]  And whoever wants to be the first must be your slave.
[522.76 --> 529.42]  Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and give his life up as a ransom for many.
[530.48 --> 531.48]  To see what he's doing here.
[531.96 --> 533.16]  I think you're seeing the movement.
[533.66 --> 538.92]  Salome is making a request for her sons to have positions of prestige and greatness in Jesus' kingdom.
[539.28 --> 544.78]  Even the disciples who are jealous also want those positions of prestige and greatness.
[545.36 --> 549.18]  And they're just thinking like everybody else in the world.
[550.26 --> 552.62]  What Jesus is saying is that's how the Gentiles think.
[553.22 --> 554.58]  That's how the world thinks.
[554.58 --> 557.82]  The world is like, oh, how do I climb the ladder to get up?
[557.88 --> 562.76]  How do I find positions of greatness and prestige and respect and admiration of others?
[562.90 --> 564.30]  How do I get to the top?
[564.58 --> 568.78]  And Jesus is saying, in my kingdom, it flips everything upside down.
[569.28 --> 570.24]  You want to be great?
[570.74 --> 571.44]  You're a servant.
[571.82 --> 573.00]  You want to have prestige?
[573.34 --> 574.32]  You become a slave.
[574.42 --> 576.90]  Because I became a slave.
[577.38 --> 578.50]  I became a servant.
[578.96 --> 580.70]  The way up is down.
[580.70 --> 597.18]  And before we work that out together, I'm just going to pause here and open up how this temptation for greatness and prestige and respect is not just for those really ambitious people who are trying to climb the ladder and they kind of trample over people, but it's all of us.
[597.90 --> 599.56]  That temptation is so subtle.
[601.04 --> 605.48]  So luring for all of us at different seasons of life, in different spheres of our lives.
[605.48 --> 610.22]  And I'm just going to give a few examples, and I would say this, if the shoe fits, wear it.
[610.36 --> 614.62]  Because I think the temptation is so much closer to home than we really believe.
[615.46 --> 616.46]  So a few examples.
[617.02 --> 619.78]  Let's say that God gave you a really good mind.
[620.80 --> 622.38]  Learning comes naturally for you.
[622.52 --> 624.72]  School was never that challenging for you.
[624.98 --> 626.38]  And you just kind of loved learning.
[626.48 --> 630.32]  But along the way, you started realizing you're smarter than other people.
[630.32 --> 637.56]  And you started realizing that you just know a lot, and you started enjoying being the person who knows a lot.
[638.06 --> 647.22]  And you enjoy the idea of getting those degrees and making sure people know that you're the intelligent one and you have the answers and they know you're above them intellectually.
[648.04 --> 648.98]  Do you see how that happened?
[649.58 --> 655.14]  The subtle movement from the gift of learning to being about you, finding your greatness in your intellect.
[655.14 --> 656.98]  Another example.
[657.62 --> 658.98]  You start work in a new company.
[659.12 --> 660.14]  You're good at what you do.
[660.20 --> 662.64]  And you go into that job saying, I'm going to serve people.
[662.70 --> 663.80]  I'm going to bless this company.
[663.88 --> 664.82]  I'm going to use my gifts.
[665.24 --> 669.76]  But you get a few years in, and as many people experience, you get a bit jaded.
[670.74 --> 678.04]  You don't necessarily love the work anymore, but you stick it out for the raises, for the pension, for that position in the corner office.
[678.04 --> 684.14]  And somehow along the way in this job, you made it about you and your greatness and your prestige.
[685.22 --> 686.42]  Or how about this?
[687.24 --> 687.68]  Parenting.
[688.22 --> 689.72]  I mean, this one, I feel.
[690.66 --> 692.44]  You want to raise your kids well.
[692.60 --> 695.66]  You want them to do well and flourish and succeed in the world.
[695.90 --> 701.78]  And somehow along the way, you know this if you're parents, you want their success to come back as your success.
[702.22 --> 702.48]  Right?
[702.48 --> 706.32]  You want people to look at your kids and say, wow, I need to meet that parent.
[706.42 --> 707.34]  They're just amazing.
[708.32 --> 709.70]  And a bit of a sidebar on this.
[709.88 --> 714.74]  A couple years ago, I actually complimented an aunt of mine because I really love how she parented.
[715.08 --> 716.12]  And she's like, no, no, no.
[716.20 --> 722.42]  I don't receive that compliment because if you compliment me for all of my children's successes, I also have to own all their failures.
[722.46 --> 723.72]  And I don't want any of it.
[724.22 --> 726.04]  And I thought that was wisdom right there.
[727.92 --> 728.98]  Or how about this?
[730.10 --> 731.20]  This is really close to home for me.
[731.20 --> 731.98]  You're a pastor.
[732.48 --> 734.12]  And you want your church to grow.
[734.52 --> 735.32]  You want it to thrive.
[735.54 --> 737.36]  You want it to sort of increase in number.
[737.90 --> 746.72]  And in so doing, you secretly hope that that growth and that flourishing makes people look at you and say, wow, now that's a successful pastor.
[748.48 --> 750.94]  Do these examples hit close to home for you?
[751.30 --> 760.48]  That desire for respect, for greatness, for prestige, for authority over others in one way or another, it is so close to our hearts.
[760.48 --> 763.16]  And the work, I think, for this passage in us.
[763.16 --> 764.76]  It's just to do some self-examination.
[764.76 --> 764.78]  It's just to do some self-examination.
[764.78 --> 766.48]  Say, where is that going for me?
[766.80 --> 767.50]  How am I lured?
[767.58 --> 772.68]  And it's often not one crazy decision you make to be some jerk who has authority over people.
[772.76 --> 781.88]  It's this gentle, gradual movement away from service and moving towards the self at the center and your own ego and all the rest.
[781.88 --> 787.82]  And Jesus, to his own disciples, cuts through this same mentality in the first century.
[787.98 --> 792.02]  And he says, that's how the world thinks, but not so for you.
[792.54 --> 794.64]  For you, the way up is down.
[794.78 --> 797.02]  The way for you is the way of servanthood.
[797.50 --> 799.18]  And he's like, let me show you how it's done.
[799.50 --> 802.34]  I will show you in my own life.
[802.34 --> 811.56]  And if there's ever a passage that I think spells out beautifully the movement of Jesus from up to down, it's Philippians chapter 2.
[811.92 --> 813.32]  And I'd like to read it for us.
[814.42 --> 817.82]  This has a lot of meaning for me because this is actually in my wedding verse.
[818.94 --> 819.64]  Notice how it starts.
[819.64 --> 848.48]  Do you see the movement there?
[848.48 --> 874.32]  That's the way of Jesus.
[874.32 --> 880.72]  And I tell you, that is just as challenging today for us as it was for his own disciples.
[881.60 --> 885.12]  And if I had to pick another passage that I would love to preach on this morning, I'm not going to.
[885.42 --> 886.78]  It's Jesus in John 13.
[886.96 --> 888.36]  He's coming near the end of his ministry.
[888.76 --> 891.42]  He's equipping his disciples for all that they're going to do after him.
[891.44 --> 892.14]  And what does he do?
[892.88 --> 901.28]  Gathers them in a room, takes off the robe, goes down on the floor, pulls out the basin and the bowl, and he washes their feet.
[901.28 --> 903.96]  I don't think they ever forgot that day.
[904.78 --> 911.76]  I don't think they ever could forget an image of Jesus, the Son of God, full of glory and power, washing their feet.
[911.82 --> 915.34]  He says, that's what it means to follow the Lord.
[915.34 --> 927.44]  Andy Crouch, an author I quite like, he was reflecting on Christian leadership, and he wrote this quote about authority, and I'm going to read it for you.
[927.44 --> 941.50]  He says, the most transformative acts in our lives are likely to be the moments where we radically empty ourselves in the very settings where we would normally be expected to exercise authority.
[942.72 --> 945.26]  Now, let me ask you, is anything coming to mind when you think about that?
[946.52 --> 953.30]  Any story of your childhood where maybe you got in a lot of trouble, and the person who you were expecting coming down hard on you actually showed grace,
[953.30 --> 956.46]  or they served you in these profound, surprising ways?
[957.32 --> 962.60]  I think those are the moments where we actually experience the life of Jesus through other people.
[963.32 --> 969.26]  When people empty themselves, when they do not have to or would not be expected to, but they do that because they follow Jesus,
[969.58 --> 973.46]  and the way of Jesus is washing the feet of the world in one way or another.
[973.46 --> 983.34]  Using your position in a company, using your responsibility, using your gifts, not to go up, but to show other people how you can serve and bless them.
[985.62 --> 995.12]  I often think to myself, and I'll invite you into imagining this, imagine the church was known not first and foremost for sort of denouncing culture for one issue or another,
[995.12 --> 1006.56]  not writing angry social media posts about one politician or another policy, but imagine the church, our church, was known for rolling up its sleeves and serving.
[1009.04 --> 1012.66]  Imagine how that would change the perception of your neighbors and my neighbors.
[1014.10 --> 1016.44]  And now let me just say a few encouraging words to us.
[1017.30 --> 1021.00]  There have been many moments where I have met people who are not part of our church,
[1021.00 --> 1025.38]  and they give to me their feedback about how they have met people at our church who have served them,
[1025.50 --> 1030.48]  or they've seen things that we do in the city, and they're encouraged by the way we care for the needs of our neighbors,
[1030.72 --> 1032.04]  and I praise the Lord for that.
[1032.80 --> 1035.72]  Because that's a reputation that I can't carry. It's cared by the whole community.
[1036.10 --> 1037.32]  Can I give you just a few examples?
[1038.64 --> 1041.62]  I mean, you heard Rob share about the Adopt-a-Street garbage cleanup,
[1042.00 --> 1047.06]  which, as we said in the earlier service, it's the most unsexy ministry we have in our church, right?
[1047.06 --> 1051.06]  You just get out there, it's often raining half the year, and you pick up garbage.
[1051.62 --> 1057.46]  And I was told by someone who served in that ministry that he has had more conversations about faith
[1057.46 --> 1061.70]  with people who are not part of our church in that particular setting than at their workplace.
[1062.10 --> 1062.82]  Isn't that fascinating?
[1063.14 --> 1066.24]  Because people see people clean up garbage and are like, why are you doing that?
[1066.26 --> 1068.02]  It's like pouring rain out here. Like, why?
[1068.14 --> 1070.54]  And you're like, oh, I'm part of Hope, and we do this once a month,
[1070.56 --> 1072.00]  and this is one of the ways we serve our community.
[1072.34 --> 1075.00]  What a simple way to show that we care and that we're serving.
[1075.00 --> 1079.14]  Let me give you another example, and this one I really love.
[1079.20 --> 1083.10]  Over the last year or two, I have noticed that we have newcomers come to our church,
[1083.22 --> 1087.16]  praise the Lord for that, and a lot of them, new to the city, new to the country in some cases,
[1087.40 --> 1088.44]  looking for jobs.
[1089.08 --> 1093.26]  And there is this, like, mysterious informal network that I can't even figure out,
[1093.32 --> 1095.16]  where it's like one person talks to one person saying,
[1095.24 --> 1097.52]  hey, this person needs a job in this area or this trade,
[1097.66 --> 1101.36]  and that person sends an email who sends a text, and all of a sudden there's a job interview,
[1101.36 --> 1105.66]  and there's this, like, amazing networking of people in different positions in our church
[1105.66 --> 1109.84]  who have helped many people they don't even know who are new to our church find a job,
[1109.90 --> 1111.52]  and I praise the Lord for that.
[1112.08 --> 1116.30]  And maybe it's worth just commenting on the side here that this passage does not invite us
[1116.30 --> 1120.24]  to leave positions of authority, does not invite us to step down from positions
[1120.24 --> 1123.40]  where we might have a great measure of influence over others.
[1123.40 --> 1128.70]  What it does is it sends us to those positions as servants, right?
[1128.76 --> 1132.40]  In Jesus' own ministry, there are many people who occupy positions of authority,
[1132.60 --> 1137.06]  and what happens is they now go back to work in that sphere, that job, that title,
[1137.18 --> 1140.56]  as a person who washes the feet of their neighbors through their work
[1140.56 --> 1145.12]  or uses the authority God has given them to bless and find work for others.
[1146.48 --> 1149.84]  Is there some percolating imagination for what that might look like for you?
[1149.84 --> 1155.42]  Could it be said of you tomorrow morning, tomorrow afternoon, Thursday evening,
[1155.42 --> 1160.12]  that you occupy the spaces where God has placed you as a servant?
[1163.28 --> 1167.02]  An example I did not share in the 9 a.m., and is Pastor Sid still here?
[1167.84 --> 1169.82]  Oh, he is here. I was hoping he wouldn't be here for this one.
[1169.86 --> 1173.68]  All right, I'm going to pick on Sid, and I find this story very, very moving
[1173.68 --> 1175.60]  because it sets an example for us as staff.
[1175.60 --> 1179.40]  Over the last couple of years, we have had people, homeless people,
[1179.50 --> 1182.66]  living or staying overnight at different places on our property,
[1182.78 --> 1184.16]  and there's been some challenges there.
[1184.28 --> 1187.80]  And we've had some neighbors come to us talking about stuff that's left on the property
[1187.80 --> 1190.54]  that we have to clean up, and I just want to say thank you to Sid
[1190.54 --> 1194.56]  and thank you to Harold Bugelink for very selfless cleaning up of our property
[1194.56 --> 1196.84]  that no one else volunteers to do very easily.
[1197.56 --> 1199.80]  But there's one young woman who is staying here for a while,
[1199.84 --> 1201.76]  and then there's another fellow who is staying here with her.
[1201.76 --> 1204.84]  And Sid had met them. A number of us had met them.
[1205.72 --> 1207.72]  And on one particular morning, she was struggling,
[1207.90 --> 1210.04]  and Sid was actually cleaning up while she was still there.
[1210.32 --> 1213.28]  And she sees Sid, and she looks at him, and she says,
[1213.64 --> 1214.62]  I know you?
[1215.04 --> 1217.72]  And then Sid's like, yeah, my name is Sid. I'm one of the pastors here.
[1217.88 --> 1221.10]  And she looks at him, and she says, nah, you're not one of the pastors.
[1222.04 --> 1225.44]  You're the janitor, because I always see you cleaning up.
[1225.86 --> 1228.80]  And when Sid shared that story, it was like this humorous story to him,
[1228.80 --> 1234.10]  but I was just like, oh my goodness, this is like the perfect embodiment of John 13, right?
[1234.44 --> 1237.78]  The lead pastor who served this church and led in so many capacities,
[1238.22 --> 1240.62]  cleaning up stuff off the yard and off the property,
[1240.86 --> 1243.74]  and having someone say, you're not the pastor, you're the janitor.
[1243.82 --> 1247.70]  And Sid, Jesus Christ was honored in that moment.
[1248.44 --> 1252.88]  And may it be said of many of us in our jobs, wherever we find ourselves,
[1252.88 --> 1258.26]  if someone confuses us for the janitor, it's like we're doing something right in our walk with Christ.
[1260.04 --> 1262.32]  And so let me finish by talking about our ministry fair.
[1263.54 --> 1265.02]  We do this every year.
[1265.22 --> 1268.00]  And if you've been around Hope, you're like, oh, every September it's a ministry fair.
[1268.06 --> 1271.80]  And it's going to keep going, because we really do believe that at the heart of what it means
[1271.80 --> 1274.66]  to be the church of Jesus Christ is to serve.
[1275.68 --> 1278.54]  And we shamelessly will have all of our leaders out in the foyer,
[1278.54 --> 1281.64]  and we're going to tell them to invite you to serve with your gifts.
[1281.94 --> 1285.42]  And you should know that we're trying to phase out a word in our church.
[1286.00 --> 1286.90]  You know what that word is?
[1288.02 --> 1288.42]  Volunteer.
[1289.16 --> 1293.24]  In my mind, when I think of volunteer, I think of like a non-profit organization,
[1293.24 --> 1296.92]  and you can sort of choose to get involved, or you can choose not to, and that's fine.
[1297.08 --> 1300.14]  But when I read the New Testament, specifically 1 Corinthians 12,
[1300.38 --> 1302.72]  we hear of the body of Christ.
[1303.50 --> 1306.36]  Every person, from youngest to oldest, having gifts.
[1306.36 --> 1311.10]  And those gifts are needed in the church, and they are needed in the city.
[1311.28 --> 1314.74]  And it's not some like optional auxiliary thing that you could do or not do.
[1315.00 --> 1318.22]  Jesus says, I've given you the gifts, and it is your responsibility
[1318.22 --> 1321.80]  to use them for the service of others.
[1322.36 --> 1324.74]  And to not do so, let me put it strongly as I can,
[1324.96 --> 1326.56]  is a disobedience to the Lord Himself.
[1328.14 --> 1331.04]  And it doesn't mean you have to do every ministry that just our church has,
[1331.10 --> 1334.10]  but it does mean whatever gifts you have, whatever space you have,
[1334.10 --> 1336.94]  whatever abilities you have, you use those as a servant.
[1337.56 --> 1340.16]  And the ministry fair, our task is simply to say,
[1340.40 --> 1343.64]  here are all the ways you can serve in our city and in our church.
[1344.44 --> 1346.40]  Where are the areas that line up with your gifts,
[1346.92 --> 1349.04]  and your schedule, and your other responsibilities,
[1349.26 --> 1354.06]  so that you and I together can wash the feet of the world this year,
[1354.42 --> 1357.00]  in our city, in our families, and in our neighborhood?
[1357.00 --> 1361.52]  Let me finish with that last line in our passage,
[1362.08 --> 1364.46]  where Jesus says to His own disciples,
[1365.04 --> 1367.92]  the Son of Man did not come to be served,
[1368.32 --> 1372.68]  but to serve and give His life as a ransom for many.
[1373.72 --> 1375.30]  Church, hear this good news,
[1375.72 --> 1378.74]  that the work of Jesus Christ going all the way down to the cross
[1378.74 --> 1381.94]  was done to liberate you and me
[1381.94 --> 1386.28]  from this selfish desire for worldly greatness.
[1387.10 --> 1389.22]  The cross liberates us from that sin.
[1389.32 --> 1392.70]  It liberates us from the power of making everything about us,
[1392.86 --> 1395.76]  our titles, our prestige, our greatness,
[1395.94 --> 1398.14]  and invites us by the power of the Spirit to say,
[1398.40 --> 1400.00]  everything I have been given,
[1400.72 --> 1403.20]  I now can use to serve others
[1403.20 --> 1405.68]  as a disciple of King Jesus,
[1405.90 --> 1409.60]  the one who laid His life down for the sake of the world.
[1409.60 --> 1411.96]  Would you join me in prayer?
[1418.68 --> 1421.92]  Father, we just marvel at what You have done in Jesus.
[1422.98 --> 1424.70]  We marvel at Your character,
[1425.60 --> 1428.90]  and we marvel at how low Jesus stooped
[1428.90 --> 1431.16]  for us and for the whole world.
[1431.76 --> 1434.16]  And we praise You for the finished work of the cross.
[1435.88 --> 1438.54]  I pray now, Lord, that You would send us
[1438.54 --> 1442.02]  by the power of Your Spirit to be servants.
[1443.08 --> 1445.92]  Would You enable us to resist all the temptation
[1445.92 --> 1448.20]  for making a name for ourselves,
[1448.74 --> 1452.48]  for holding an unhealthy level of greatness over others,
[1453.00 --> 1455.32]  and instead become those who serve.
[1456.56 --> 1458.02]  Lord, give us a vision
[1458.02 --> 1460.88]  for what that looks like in our ordinary lives.
[1460.88 --> 1462.98]  Give us an imagination
[1462.98 --> 1465.82]  for how to do it in new and fresh ways this year,
[1466.32 --> 1468.60]  and fill us with Your power
[1468.60 --> 1471.48]  to make Jesus known through our service.
[1472.18 --> 1472.42]  Amen.
[1474.34 --> 1475.72]  Would you stand and sing with me
[1475.72 --> 1476.68]  a song of response,
[1476.78 --> 1477.50]  Heal Our Land.
[1477.50 --> 1478.82]  What s think of this?
[1478.82 --> 1478.88]  God bless you all.
[1478.96 --> 1493.86]  Let me now write it down to a
[1493.88 --> 1494.66]  song of thành and her place
[1494.80 --> 1495.72]  for you in nine months.
[1495.72 --> 1496.80]  Come back and listen to The High Side
[1497.16 --> 1497.38]  and Jaguar.
[1497.70 --> 1498.44]  But to be part of theover
[1499.20 --> 1501.80]  until you stand and thank HerAS
[1502.32 --> 1503.70]  that works best for her.
[1503.86 --> 1504.64]  Give us a prayer
[1504.88 --> 1506.00]  and perfectweed Johnson
