[0.00 → 10.24] Well, good morning, Hope.
[13.82 → 21.10] So last Friday, I was looking over Pastor Sid's sermon notes, and I noticed that he
[21.10 → 25.28] had Romans 7 in his sermon notes, and I said to him, I actually texted him, I said, Sid,
[25.28 → 28.50] I see that you're preaching on Romans 7, like, I just want you to know I'm preaching
[28.50 → 31.76] on that next week, so try not to steal that from me.
[31.84 → 34.70] And he said to me, and I quote, I'll just touch on it.
[36.48 → 38.60] Then you, yeah, you know where this is going.
[38.72 → 42.96] So Sid's preaching last Sunday, and I'm like, man, he's saying a lot about Romans 7.
[43.58 → 48.34] He's making a lot of the same points I want to make next week, and so I'm not going to
[48.34 → 50.34] preach on Romans 7 because that's already been done.
[50.48 → 52.00] Thank you, Sid, wherever you are.
[55.20 → 56.98] So instead, I'm going to pass it forward.
[56.98 → 60.34] I'm going to steal from Pastor Jonathan's sermon next week and preach on 1 John.
[61.78 → 65.36] I actually am going to preach on 1 John because that does dovetail with his sermon.
[65.50 → 66.94] I'm not going to do what Sid did to me.
[67.58 → 71.56] If you have your Bible, digital or physical, turn with me to 1 John.
[71.64 → 73.12] We're going to start reading at verse 5.
[73.12 → 79.46] This is the message.
[79.80 → 82.66] We have heard from him and declare to you.
[83.58 → 85.52] God is light.
[86.14 → 87.96] In him there is no darkness at all.
[88.66 → 93.86] If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in darkness, we lie, and we do not
[93.86 → 94.76] live out the truth.
[94.76 → 99.52] But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another,
[99.76 → 103.18] and the blood of Jesus, his son, purifies us from all sin.
[104.14 → 108.72] If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
[109.28 → 114.66] If we confess our sins, he's faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify
[114.66 → 116.36] us from all unrighteousness.
[116.36 → 123.00] If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.
[123.90 → 128.22] My dear children, I write this so that you will not sin.
[128.96 → 134.56] But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous
[134.56 → 134.96] one.
[135.56 → 141.42] He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not only for ours, but also for the sins of
[141.42 → 142.42] the whole world.
[142.98 → 143.92] This is God's word.
[146.36 → 149.76] Let me just remind us where we're coming from in this series.
[150.44 → 153.94] We have been saying from the beginning of this Lent series that the life of the church,
[154.06 → 159.62] the life of believers, is not one of passive comfort, passive safety.
[159.84 → 160.66] It's one of battle.
[161.40 → 166.28] It's one of battling the flesh, battling the idols of our culture, and battling Satan's
[166.28 → 166.72] temptation.
[167.50 → 170.88] And this morning, I'm going to continue where Sid started last week by looking at the way
[170.88 → 172.58] in which we battle against the flesh.
[172.58 → 178.34] Now, this week, I happened to be listening to a podcast by a woman named Rebecca McLaughlin.
[179.14 → 181.24] She wrote a book called Confronting Christianity.
[181.38 → 183.64] In fact, I think one of our small groups is working through that book.
[183.94 → 186.82] And she has a podcast that actually works its way through the questions.
[187.26 → 190.52] And they're all these big questions that people ask about the Christian faith.
[191.10 → 194.80] The question that she was tackling in the podcast and the book are this.
[194.80 → 200.36] And she asked another professor this one, why is it that God doesn't save everyone?
[201.14 → 206.18] Why isn't salvation just everyone's to have and everyone gets into heaven at the end, so
[206.18 → 206.62] to speak?
[207.98 → 209.62] And then she posed this to the professor.
[209.72 → 213.28] I'm not going to go into his very nuanced response, but I thought his initial response
[213.28 → 214.68] was so perceptive.
[215.32 → 217.04] He said, you know, I get that question a lot.
[217.68 → 221.80] A lot of people, when they're engaging Christianity, they think, well, what's this limited salvation
[221.80 → 222.00] thing?
[222.00 → 224.08] Why doesn't everyone just get to be saved?
[224.52 → 227.28] And he said, what's behind the question is two assumptions.
[227.44 → 230.90] Number one, that God is a loving God, but we forget about His justice.
[231.00 → 235.68] But number two, and more to the point of this series, we often think of humans as good and
[235.68 → 238.22] loving people who have nothing but good for the world.
[238.54 → 243.04] And he said, if you read through the biblical account of how the human nature is described,
[243.56 → 244.86] he said, it's not good news.
[245.22 → 249.66] Ever since Genesis 3, there's a rebellious heart, there's twisted desires, there's destructive
[249.66 → 250.04] habits.
[250.04 → 252.72] There's a rejection of God's ways in the world.
[253.04 → 255.52] And he said, a better way to frame the question is this.
[256.20 → 261.92] In light of the human nature, our rebellious hearts, why would God save anyone?
[263.34 → 265.88] Then in the course of the conversation, Rebecca made this comment.
[265.98 → 268.16] It's actually just been working its way in my head ever since.
[268.22 → 273.60] She said, you know, I'm convinced that every friendship would die within a week if we could
[273.60 → 274.88] read each other's thoughts.
[274.88 → 277.54] What do you think?
[279.30 → 280.80] It's a good thing we don't have that, right?
[281.72 → 284.98] There's a sense in which is people really knew what was going on in your heart and your
[284.98 → 288.90] mind, your imagination and your desires, like marriages would fracture, friendships would
[288.90 → 295.40] fall apart, family systems would go into disarray because we know how much brokenness and distorted
[295.40 → 298.20] stuff just rattles around the imagination and the heart.
[298.20 → 302.14] We know if we're honest with ourselves how bad it is.
[303.82 → 305.88] John wants to talk about that.
[306.58 → 312.06] He wants us to circle around this question of like the sinful nature, the nature of self-deception,
[312.06 → 315.72] and maybe more importantly, we're going to focus the second half of our time together on this.
[315.72 → 322.02] What do we do once we become somewhat aware of the mess within, the distorted desires, the
[322.02 → 323.84] very destructive habits?
[323.92 → 324.92] What do we do with those?
[325.64 → 326.88] John's got good news for us.
[328.02 → 331.50] Now, one of the things I love about John, and I think we're going to come back to this in
[331.50 → 335.52] a sermon series because I was just like drinking up the richness of this book, and the little
[335.52 → 338.94] Johns at the back of the Bible, you know, first, second, third John, they get neglected.
[339.54 → 345.10] But you need to know that his big aim is that Christians have fellowship with God.
[345.10 → 351.56] Like what John sees is so rich about the gospel is that Jesus brings people into deep, meaningful,
[351.80 → 354.82] active fellowship with the living God.
[355.54 → 360.50] We were created for a rich, conversational relating to our Heavenly Father, and I hope
[360.50 → 364.70] we never get tired of talking about this and worshipping a God who wants to be known.
[365.62 → 368.12] He's not some wooden, disinterested deity at a distance.
[368.48 → 373.56] He's a loving Father who reveals His heart, who reveals His love, who reveals His grace.
[373.56 → 375.30] That's at the heart of Christianity.
[376.18 → 380.38] And the reason sin matters so much in John is that it breaks fellowship.
[381.42 → 383.56] You know this in your family, in your marriage, with your kids.
[383.90 → 388.80] When something sinful happens, when trust is broken, there's a rupture in that relationship.
[388.96 → 391.58] There's a distance that is created by that act of sin.
[391.76 → 392.54] Fellowship is broken.
[392.94 → 394.80] And the same is true with our relationship with God.
[395.66 → 397.36] Sin destroys fellowship.
[397.36 → 403.64] Now, the specific reason John writes this book is that there is a group in the church
[403.64 → 404.50] of false teachers.
[405.32 → 407.60] They're described, the fancy name for them is early Gnostics.
[407.98 → 410.28] They sort of have gone beyond the teaching of Jesus.
[410.52 → 414.70] They have spiritual experiences and emerging philosophies that sort of relegate the scriptures
[414.70 → 415.32] to secondary.
[415.90 → 419.52] They've got all sorts of ideas, and they're shaping and influencing and bringing Christians
[419.52 → 421.32] away from the truth of Jesus.
[421.32 → 429.02] And these false teachers make some huge, bold claims that John is very ready to respond
[429.02 → 429.86] to and speak into.
[429.92 → 431.60] He's got some strong words about these claims.
[431.70 → 435.08] And so we're going to look at them in order, and then we're going to look at John's antidote,
[435.18 → 437.74] as you might say, to what we do with the sin within.
[439.10 → 440.48] Look at verse 6 with me.
[441.24 → 443.48] In verse 6, this is what John says, if we claim.
[443.56 → 446.08] And when he's saying we, he talks about these are the false teachers.
[446.08 → 453.02] He writes, if we claim to have fellowship with him, that's God, and yet walk in the darkness,
[453.88 → 457.08] we lie and do not live out the truth.
[457.94 → 462.56] Now, what's happening here, and this is probably not so uncommon if we're honest, these teachers,
[463.10 → 467.06] these false teachers are saying, look, we've got a great relationship with God.
[467.76 → 470.22] We're experiencing this rich relationship with God.
[470.32 → 472.22] We know him, and we're being known by him.
[472.22 → 477.80] But what John is saying and seeing is that they're actually not living as followers of the way.
[478.50 → 481.08] They're not concerned with the teaching that has been revealed to them,
[481.20 → 483.00] and they're actually walking in darkness.
[484.02 → 485.58] And so their words don't match their deeds.
[485.66 → 488.52] And I think you can now see how this is a very relevant thing in our day today.
[488.80 → 491.66] They're speaking as though they're close to the Lord, but you look at their lives like,
[492.08 → 494.98] no, they are not walking in fellowship with the Lord.
[495.18 → 495.86] They're deceived.
[496.82 → 501.58] One commentator extends this point to not just our words and what we say about our relationship with God,
[501.58 → 502.68] but also how we feel.
[503.76 → 505.60] Our feelings can also betray us.
[505.66 → 507.22] We can feel like we're close to the Lord.
[507.28 → 510.30] We can feel somehow that we have this deep relationship when we're walking in darkness
[510.30 → 515.56] and not dealing with the way in which our ordinary daily life is at a sync with his ways.
[516.12 → 517.32] And so we're self-deceived.
[518.16 → 519.86] And John's got some strong words about that, right?
[520.32 → 522.94] If we walk in darkness, but we think we have fellowship with him,
[523.44 → 526.32] we lie and do not live in the truth.
[526.32 → 532.64] It's really important at this point to highlight, and this is what John would want us to say.
[533.58 → 537.24] The only way you can know how to live in fellowship with God,
[537.92 → 543.50] the only way you can know how to walk in the light is by the scriptures that have been revealed to us.
[544.18 → 546.70] The teachings of Christ that we have before us in the Word.
[546.92 → 549.54] That's the only way you can say, okay, this is the way of life,
[549.56 → 551.40] because our hearts will always deceive us.
[552.36 → 555.52] Our imaginations will always lead us down, okay, I can do this but not that,
[555.66 → 558.76] and we can make ourselves think it's fine when it's not fine.
[558.78 → 560.76] And that's precisely what these teachers were doing.
[561.30 → 563.54] They were saying, you know, we've got this new spiritual experience.
[563.76 → 565.48] We have this new way of relating to God.
[565.56 → 566.38] We don't need the scriptures.
[566.80 → 570.30] And John's saying, no, you might think you have this close relationship,
[570.42 → 572.40] but you're walking in darkness.
[572.54 → 574.90] Your habits are far from the way of Jesus.
[574.90 → 578.60] You need to return to what has been given to us in the revealed Word.
[578.60 → 582.24] That's how we know what it looks like to walk in the light.
[584.88 → 588.56] Interestingly, I would expect John at the end of verse 6 to say,
[588.68 → 590.66] you know if you walk in darkness, you deceive yourselves,
[590.74 → 591.82] and you do not live in the truth.
[592.06 → 593.84] But if you walk in the light, next verse,
[593.94 → 595.78] but if we walk in the light as he is in the light,
[596.22 → 597.80] we have fellowship with God.
[597.92 → 598.84] No, it doesn't say that.
[599.10 → 601.62] It says we have fellowship with one another.
[602.48 → 605.88] And the reason I point this out is that I expected John to say something else.
[605.88 → 609.62] But what he seems to emphasize in the place of having fellowship with God
[609.62 → 611.18] is fellowship with believers.
[612.06 → 614.34] And I want to highlight how important this is.
[615.02 → 617.38] For John, as it is for all the Christian writers,
[617.94 → 621.38] to have a relationship with God is to have a relationship with the church.
[622.12 → 623.18] Or as one writer puts it,
[623.24 → 626.42] you don't get to have God as your father without the church as your mother.
[626.42 → 630.98] And you can't have fellowship with God without fellowship with the body of Christ.
[631.12 → 635.94] And very much so, the body of Christ holds us in fellowship with the Father.
[636.60 → 638.08] As we live in a healthy relationship,
[638.20 → 640.96] you're going to have brothers and sisters who model the way of Jesus.
[641.08 → 643.68] They're going to show you as you grow what it looks like to follow him.
[643.70 → 645.64] And you're going to also have, if you've got a healthy church,
[646.06 → 647.74] people who will challenge you when you're not.
[648.60 → 650.40] People who will say, this is not the way of Christ.
[650.58 → 652.42] This is what it means to be in fellowship with Christ.
[652.42 → 655.02] This is how we live together as disciples of Jesus.
[655.70 → 658.76] And what's happening then, and this still happens all the time today,
[659.26 → 660.94] people get a fascinating idea.
[661.76 → 663.34] They have perhaps a spiritual experience.
[663.60 → 666.48] They have some new insight, they think, that's new to the church,
[666.74 → 667.60] new to the Christian faith.
[667.74 → 669.86] And they sort of pursue that as a way of life.
[670.04 → 671.84] And the church is like, well, where is that in the scriptures?
[672.56 → 673.98] Like, where is that in the history of the church?
[674.04 → 674.88] And like, well, this is new.
[674.94 → 676.06] It's my new thing.
[676.34 → 678.34] And then they eventually depart from the church.
[678.76 → 679.72] They depart from truth.
[679.72 → 681.42] And then they depart from fellowship with God.
[681.42 → 683.56] God, this is not an uncommon trajectory.
[684.18 → 688.02] And this, by the way, is how almost every sect and cult starts.
[688.78 → 690.92] It starts with someone often who is part of the church, like,
[691.00 → 692.60] oh, I've got this brilliant new idea.
[692.90 → 694.48] No one's ever thought of it before.
[694.74 → 697.54] Which, by the way, always be aware when someone says that.
[697.64 → 699.30] It's like, the church has been around for a while.
[699.42 → 700.88] There's a lot of stuff that's been thought about,
[700.96 → 701.78] reflected on the scriptures.
[702.08 → 704.42] When you as an individual have a brand-new thought,
[704.72 → 706.44] you should be a little bit wary of that.
[706.98 → 708.22] But that's what's happening in the church then.
[708.22 → 712.00] These new insights, these new ideas that are departing people from fellowship with the church
[712.00 → 714.22] and departing them from fellowship with God himself.
[715.96 → 717.30] So that's the first claim.
[717.82 → 720.08] Let's take a look now at the second claim.
[720.72 → 721.80] Verse 8 and verse 10.
[722.76 → 728.28] If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
[728.86 → 729.44] Verse 10.
[729.44 → 736.14] If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.
[736.98 → 740.40] Now, these false teachers, they had gone so far as to say,
[740.48 → 742.08] this feels like such a bold thing to say,
[742.54 → 746.32] not only are we not currently sinning, they're saying, but we have never sinned.
[747.20 → 747.84] Everything's good.
[748.00 → 748.96] We have fellowship with God.
[749.28 → 750.54] There's no sin in our lives.
[750.76 → 752.00] We're at peace with where we're at.
[752.40 → 753.10] Everything's fine.
[753.10 → 760.12] And I can just imagine how John was feeling because nothing cuts at the need for Jesus
[760.12 → 762.12] more than getting rid of sin, right?
[762.32 → 763.54] Why would Jesus need to come?
[763.98 → 766.60] What's the purpose of the gospel if people are saying, well, we haven't sinned.
[766.98 → 768.28] There is no sin within us.
[768.70 → 770.58] And that's what happens when you depart from the scriptures
[770.58 → 773.44] and you start letting your own heart lead the way,
[773.78 → 776.66] you'll find yourself holding all sorts of strange teachings, including this one.
[776.66 → 782.38] But here's my question, and this now circles back to Sid's stolen sermon from last week.
[785.14 → 790.62] Is this not that far off from our cultural assumption about what it means to be a human?
[791.30 → 795.38] You know, Sid rattled off a number of phrases in our culture about how we see ourselves,
[795.48 → 797.98] and some of those phrases were, you do you, right?
[798.82 → 799.94] You do what you want to do.
[800.00 → 801.24] Don't worry about what other people are saying.
[801.60 → 803.18] Follow your own heart.
[803.18 → 806.74] And behind those statements, and many others like it,
[806.94 → 810.68] is the assumption that what's within here is trustworthy and good,
[810.86 → 812.66] and the bad stuff is all out there.
[812.72 → 814.10] And I think that's actually fairly accurate.
[814.24 → 817.68] Most people, if you grow up in Canada, you think humans are fundamentally good.
[817.92 → 821.96] We make mistakes, but that's usually because we have bad parents or bad teachers or bad culture,
[822.08 → 823.30] but it's actually not from within.
[824.36 → 828.02] And John's got some of the strongest language to share
[828.02 → 830.34] with people who think they are not sinful.
[831.46 → 833.08] Do you hear what he said in those passages?
[833.18 → 837.40] If we claim to not be sinning or to never have sinned, he says,
[837.76 → 844.18] we make God out to be a liar, and His Word is not within us.
[844.84 → 847.60] That's what John says to someone who can boast about not having sin
[847.60 → 849.92] and to not being in the process of sinning.
[851.50 → 853.98] And to restate what Sid said so well last week,
[854.62 → 859.54] the invitation of the Scriptures for Christians is to be honest.
[859.54 → 865.68] It is to have an honest self-assessment of the power of the flesh,
[866.20 → 869.22] the destructive desires, and the disordered ambitions
[869.22 → 872.22] that ruin our lives and ruin others' lives.
[872.92 → 874.94] That's why, you know, I think of Romans 7,
[875.08 → 876.74] which, you know, Sid already preached on last week.
[877.12 → 878.96] I'm sneaking in what I wanted to say again here.
[879.82 → 880.96] You know where Paul just says,
[880.96 → 883.24] what a wretched man that I am.
[883.34 → 885.38] Who can rescue me from this body of death?
[885.60 → 888.88] Now that is an honest assessment of the human condition.
[889.76 → 891.42] And it's when you get to that place
[891.42 → 894.60] that you see the beauty and the power of the gospel.
[896.04 → 898.34] But I want to point our attention to what John says.
[898.76 → 899.64] After verse 8,
[900.02 → 901.30] you're claiming to be without sin,
[901.48 → 902.50] you make God a liar,
[902.62 → 903.78] and you are not living in the truth.
[903.82 → 905.34] But then what does he say in verse 9?
[905.34 → 908.60] This is now how we deal with our sin.
[908.66 → 909.28] You ready for it?
[910.06 → 912.58] If we confess our sins,
[913.12 → 914.74] he is faithful and just
[914.74 → 916.58] and will forgive us our sins
[916.58 → 919.84] and purify us from unrighteousness.
[921.82 → 923.46] John introduces us
[923.46 → 925.14] to one of the most basic
[925.14 → 928.22] and important historic practices in the church.
[928.34 → 929.00] You know what that is?
[929.94 → 930.52] Confession.
[931.78 → 934.34] It's what we do when we start to see the mess.
[934.34 → 936.14] It's what we do when we realize
[936.14 → 938.00] what's within us is dark and disordered,
[938.14 → 939.56] and what we don't do is hide it,
[939.90 → 940.70] conceal it,
[941.00 → 941.86] lie about it,
[941.96 → 942.84] not talk about it.
[942.88 → 944.88] We actually bring it into the light
[944.88 → 946.52] through confession.
[948.14 → 949.62] That's how we find healing
[949.62 → 951.94] and mercy and grace.
[953.88 → 955.76] Now the Bible actually has a lot to say
[955.76 → 958.56] about when you hold your sin within
[958.56 → 960.22] and you don't confess it.
[960.64 → 962.78] The sort of suppression of the stuff within.
[962.78 → 965.30] And Psalm 32 and Psalm 51,
[965.54 → 966.58] both powerful psalms.
[966.68 → 967.40] You know, in Psalm 32,
[967.52 → 967.96] David says,
[968.08 → 969.64] when I didn't confess my sin,
[969.92 → 971.60] I wasted away.
[972.28 → 973.00] There's a sense of like,
[973.04 → 973.78] you just find yourself
[973.78 → 974.94] imploding a little bit.
[974.98 → 976.06] You find yourself just weakened
[976.06 → 977.16] by the power of sin
[977.16 → 979.60] and also the struggle of concealing it.
[981.00 → 982.32] Let me read for you a quote
[982.32 → 983.72] that comes from Civic Bonhoeffer,
[983.84 → 985.86] and I just love his honesty in this quote
[985.86 → 988.40] about sin and its effect on our lives.
[988.40 → 989.78] He writes,
[989.88 → 992.68] sin demands to have a man by himself.
[993.76 → 995.74] It withdraws them from the community.
[996.46 → 998.86] The more isolated a person is,
[999.18 → 1001.26] the more destructive will be
[1001.26 → 1002.84] the power of sin over him.
[1003.96 → 1005.58] Sin wants to remain unknown.
[1006.26 → 1008.04] It shuns the light.
[1008.78 → 1010.58] In the darkness of the expressed,
[1010.80 → 1014.60] it poisons the whole being of a person.
[1014.60 → 1018.14] Now, just be honest with me.
[1018.68 → 1019.66] Can you relate to that?
[1021.32 → 1022.96] Can you relate to sort of the weight
[1022.96 → 1024.02] of unconfessed sin?
[1025.06 → 1026.78] You know, I grew up in a Dutch culture,
[1026.88 → 1027.60] a Dutch subculture,
[1027.80 → 1029.62] and there's a word that people often use
[1029.62 → 1030.42] to describe Dutch people,
[1030.54 → 1031.14] which is stoic,
[1031.24 → 1031.60] which is like,
[1031.64 → 1032.68] no matter what's going on,
[1032.72 → 1033.16] you just like,
[1033.24 → 1034.14] you hold it together.
[1034.64 → 1036.44] And I think one of the downsides to that
[1036.44 → 1038.22] is you can almost try to conceal
[1038.22 → 1041.22] or bury the brokenness, right?
[1041.58 → 1043.06] There's just stuff going on in your life
[1043.06 → 1043.66] that is shameful,
[1043.66 → 1044.30] that's difficult,
[1044.50 → 1045.94] that's really destructive,
[1046.14 → 1046.80] and you're just like,
[1047.06 → 1048.18] we're just going to push that
[1048.18 → 1049.56] really deep down.
[1049.84 → 1051.30] No one's going to know about that.
[1051.36 → 1053.02] I'm not going to talk to anyone about that.
[1053.16 → 1053.88] And as a result,
[1053.98 → 1056.22] you just live with profound shame.
[1057.18 → 1058.94] You live with profound sense
[1058.94 → 1060.02] of being unworthy.
[1060.16 → 1061.20] You live in all sorts of pain
[1061.20 → 1062.30] that you're not even sure what to do with
[1062.30 → 1064.30] because you've just buried your sin.
[1065.64 → 1066.72] And John says,
[1067.46 → 1068.86] find the freedom through confession.
[1070.48 → 1072.06] Bring the sin to the light.
[1074.10 → 1075.50] That's where you're going to find the forgiveness.
[1076.64 → 1078.04] That's where you're going to find the grace.
[1079.24 → 1081.62] And I'm a huge advocate of daily confession.
[1081.84 → 1083.04] I know a number of people in our church,
[1083.12 → 1084.48] even when we do community prayer,
[1084.86 → 1086.38] we do the acts' prayer,
[1086.64 → 1087.62] adoration, confession,
[1087.96 → 1088.50] thanksgiving,
[1089.56 → 1090.22] supplication.
[1091.44 → 1092.78] And so you do this daily confession.
[1092.94 → 1093.24] You sort of,
[1093.36 → 1094.26] as one writer puts it,
[1094.34 → 1094.58] you know,
[1094.66 → 1096.48] every day we're filled with all sorts of stuff
[1096.48 → 1097.34] that we're not proud of,
[1097.38 → 1098.66] and we do things we're not proud of.
[1098.66 → 1098.96] And we just,
[1099.30 → 1100.32] the act of confession
[1100.32 → 1102.08] is sort of taking the trash to the road.
[1102.50 → 1103.44] I like that image of like,
[1103.60 → 1104.58] you just gather it up
[1104.58 → 1104.86] and you're like,
[1104.92 → 1105.42] all right, Lord,
[1105.56 → 1106.54] this is the mess.
[1106.74 → 1107.70] Have mercy on me
[1107.70 → 1109.16] according to your great love,
[1109.30 → 1110.82] according to your unfailing mercy.
[1111.34 → 1111.86] Renew me.
[1111.94 → 1112.36] And Jesus,
[1112.50 → 1113.86] who loves to heal us,
[1114.44 → 1115.98] who loves to purify us,
[1116.06 → 1116.96] meets us in his grace.
[1118.04 → 1119.04] But confession
[1119.04 → 1120.40] is both vertical
[1120.40 → 1122.42] and it's horizontal.
[1123.26 → 1124.42] And I think what's been lost
[1124.42 → 1127.14] in a very individualized Western church
[1127.14 → 1129.42] is learning how to confess our sins
[1129.42 → 1130.22] to one another
[1130.22 → 1131.66] and with one another.
[1132.98 → 1134.14] And let me just read for you
[1134.14 → 1135.76] this sort of prodding words
[1135.76 → 1137.04] of James 5, 16.
[1137.34 → 1138.48] We did this in our sermon series
[1138.48 → 1139.18] a few months ago
[1139.18 → 1140.78] and this kind of grabbed me.
[1141.34 → 1141.76] He writes,
[1141.92 → 1142.16] therefore,
[1142.54 → 1143.22] actually I'm just going to say,
[1143.28 → 1144.66] I both love and hate this verse
[1144.66 → 1145.42] at the same time.
[1146.00 → 1146.88] It's so beautiful
[1146.88 → 1148.32] and it is so deeply challenging.
[1148.44 → 1148.74] He writes,
[1149.12 → 1150.68] therefore confess your sins
[1150.68 → 1152.26] to each other
[1152.26 → 1154.34] and pray for each other.
[1154.44 → 1154.74] Why?
[1156.30 → 1158.06] So that you may be healed.
[1159.74 → 1160.88] Don't you want healing?
[1161.78 → 1163.24] Don't you want a sense of renewal
[1163.24 → 1164.06] and transformation?
[1164.24 → 1164.88] Well, James says
[1164.88 → 1165.40] that comes through
[1165.40 → 1166.24] confessing your sins
[1166.24 → 1166.84] to one another
[1166.84 → 1168.44] and praying for each other
[1168.44 → 1170.66] as brothers and sisters in faith.
[1170.72 → 1172.98] And let me just push you into this.
[1173.52 → 1174.78] Find a trusted friend.
[1175.70 → 1176.38] Find a mentor,
[1176.56 → 1177.34] a youth pastor,
[1177.80 → 1178.70] someone in your small group
[1178.70 → 1179.90] or perhaps your whole small group
[1179.90 → 1182.36] and begin to practice confession.
[1183.18 → 1184.26] You don't have to tell everyone
[1184.26 → 1184.86] your stuff,
[1185.18 → 1186.80] but you do need to tell someone
[1186.80 → 1188.10] about your stuff.
[1189.70 → 1190.94] And you probably know
[1190.94 → 1191.80] if you've done this
[1191.80 → 1193.00] that there's something
[1193.00 → 1194.34] very powerful,
[1195.08 → 1195.50] mysterious,
[1195.76 → 1196.30] and beautiful,
[1196.42 → 1196.92] I would say,
[1197.00 → 1198.62] about speaking out loud
[1198.62 → 1199.56] words of confession.
[1200.32 → 1200.50] In fact,
[1200.56 → 1201.16] John Mark Homer
[1201.16 → 1201.80] in his book,
[1201.88 → 1202.44] Live No Lies,
[1202.52 → 1203.88] he writes this about confession.
[1204.02 → 1204.30] I just,
[1204.42 → 1205.48] I resonate with this
[1205.48 → 1206.24] in my own experience.
[1206.24 → 1206.70] He writes,
[1207.24 → 1208.64] there is a raw power
[1208.64 → 1210.62] and genuine freedom
[1210.62 → 1211.20] that comes
[1211.20 → 1213.08] when you name your sin
[1213.08 → 1214.34] in the presence
[1214.34 → 1216.38] of loving Christian community.
[1217.34 → 1218.24] Just the act
[1218.24 → 1219.02] of naming your sin
[1219.02 → 1219.38] out loud
[1219.38 → 1220.28] to people you know
[1220.28 → 1220.94] and trust
[1220.94 → 1222.08] has the power
[1222.08 → 1223.06] to break chains.
[1223.14 → 1223.86] Do you believe that?
[1225.24 → 1225.94] Are you willing
[1225.94 → 1226.96] to practice that?
[1228.48 → 1228.96] And you know,
[1229.10 → 1229.64] the people who have
[1229.64 → 1230.40] a front row seat,
[1230.46 → 1230.74] by the way,
[1230.78 → 1231.68] to the power of confession
[1231.68 → 1233.14] are counsellors
[1233.14 → 1234.32] and therapists.
[1234.32 → 1235.24] You know,
[1235.28 → 1236.30] my brother is a counsellor
[1236.30 → 1237.96] and he shared with me
[1237.96 → 1238.56] just the way
[1238.56 → 1239.36] in which he's seen
[1239.36 → 1240.72] just years perhaps,
[1240.80 → 1241.44] you can just imagine
[1241.44 → 1241.90] a couple.
[1242.60 → 1243.80] There's been unfaithfulness perhaps,
[1243.88 → 1244.82] there's been destructive habits
[1244.82 → 1245.42] that have been hidden
[1245.42 → 1246.38] and concealed for years
[1246.38 → 1247.62] and then comes that moment
[1247.62 → 1248.48] after some therapy
[1248.48 → 1249.62] of just being willing
[1249.62 → 1250.16] to talk about
[1250.16 → 1251.10] where someone finally
[1251.10 → 1252.66] speaks out loud
[1252.66 → 1254.26] infidelity,
[1255.54 → 1255.98] greed,
[1256.34 → 1256.94] destructive habits,
[1256.98 → 1257.78] when they finally just say,
[1257.98 → 1259.52] this is what I've been up to
[1259.52 → 1260.16] or this is what
[1260.16 → 1260.86] I've been struggling with
[1260.86 → 1262.14] and you probably know
[1262.14 → 1262.94] when that happens,
[1263.20 → 1264.20] it often feels like
[1264.20 → 1265.48] thousands of pounds
[1265.48 → 1266.20] of weight
[1266.20 → 1267.66] shed from your shoulders.
[1269.30 → 1271.36] Confession is a powerful thing.
[1272.38 → 1273.12] There's a reason
[1273.12 → 1274.46] we are instructed,
[1274.98 → 1276.16] commanded to do this
[1276.16 → 1276.80] as Christians
[1276.80 → 1278.30] within Christian community.
[1280.70 → 1281.86] So let me just get right
[1281.86 → 1282.62] in your business here.
[1282.68 → 1283.28] You ready for it?
[1285.06 → 1286.50] What's the stuff
[1286.50 → 1288.62] that's breaking
[1288.62 → 1289.88] your fellowship with God?
[1291.88 → 1292.76] What's the stuff
[1292.76 → 1293.30] that's really
[1293.30 → 1294.24] wrecking relationship
[1294.24 → 1295.04] with a friend,
[1295.26 → 1296.16] a friend,
[1296.24 → 1296.88] a coworker,
[1297.04 → 1297.78] a classmate,
[1298.06 → 1298.70] a child,
[1298.80 → 1299.24] a parent,
[1299.32 → 1299.98] or a spouse?
[1301.18 → 1301.54] Where,
[1301.74 → 1302.42] even as you hear
[1302.42 → 1303.52] this word this morning,
[1304.26 → 1305.46] where are you just feeling
[1305.46 → 1306.32] that natural,
[1306.50 → 1307.12] prodding,
[1307.28 → 1308.20] spirit conviction?
[1309.88 → 1310.76] What's the habit
[1310.76 → 1311.56] that you're just tripping
[1311.56 → 1312.52] over and over
[1312.52 → 1313.54] and over again?
[1313.54 → 1316.10] the invitation
[1316.10 → 1317.40] of God's word
[1317.40 → 1319.10] is to bring it
[1319.10 → 1319.78] to the light.
[1320.94 → 1321.96] Bring it into confession
[1321.96 → 1322.70] with your father
[1322.70 → 1323.44] who loves you.
[1324.10 → 1324.90] Bring it into confession
[1324.90 → 1326.30] with the advocate Jesus
[1326.30 → 1327.28] who is for you
[1327.28 → 1328.98] and discover freedom
[1328.98 → 1329.88] and healing
[1329.88 → 1330.66] and renewal.
[1332.74 → 1333.72] I want to finish
[1333.72 → 1334.48] our time together
[1334.48 → 1335.38] by focusing on
[1335.38 → 1336.06] my favourite part
[1336.06 → 1336.72] of the passage,
[1337.08 → 1338.42] which is chapter two.
[1338.76 → 1339.28] Let me read it
[1339.28 → 1339.94] for us again.
[1339.94 → 1342.32] My dear children,
[1342.44 → 1343.16] I write this to you
[1343.16 → 1344.52] so that you will not sin
[1344.52 → 1345.44] because,
[1345.64 → 1346.06] by the way,
[1346.18 → 1347.12] sin is not inevitable
[1347.12 → 1347.78] now that the work
[1347.78 → 1348.74] of Jesus is finished.
[1349.34 → 1350.76] But if anybody does sin,
[1350.86 → 1352.26] we have an advocate
[1352.26 → 1353.20] with the Father,
[1353.74 → 1354.68] Jesus Christ,
[1354.92 → 1355.90] the righteous one.
[1356.48 → 1357.88] He is the atoning
[1357.88 → 1359.62] sacrifice for our sins
[1359.62 → 1360.86] and not only for ours
[1360.86 → 1362.38] but also for the sins
[1362.38 → 1364.62] of the whole world.
[1365.26 → 1366.44] Just feel the power
[1366.44 → 1367.48] of the cross of Jesus.
[1368.14 → 1369.34] The reason God
[1369.34 → 1370.46] sends his son
[1370.46 → 1371.80] is to seek
[1371.80 → 1372.80] and save the lost.
[1373.16 → 1374.20] The reason God
[1374.20 → 1375.18] sends Jesus,
[1375.32 → 1376.48] the incarnate word,
[1376.80 → 1378.20] is so that lost children
[1378.20 → 1379.32] can find freedom
[1379.32 → 1379.82] and fellowship
[1379.82 → 1380.48] once again
[1380.48 → 1381.60] through the cross.
[1382.46 → 1383.58] God was delighted
[1383.58 → 1384.94] to accomplish
[1384.94 → 1385.82] for his world
[1385.82 → 1386.88] and for his church
[1386.88 → 1387.86] salvation.
[1389.16 → 1390.20] He was delighted
[1390.20 → 1391.22] to make this happen.
[1391.34 → 1391.58] Yes,
[1391.74 → 1392.26] it came through
[1392.26 → 1393.76] excruciating sacrifice
[1393.76 → 1394.94] but God,
[1395.04 → 1395.68] Father, Son,
[1395.74 → 1396.16] and Spirit
[1396.16 → 1397.96] together in perfect unity
[1397.96 → 1398.80] said this is how
[1398.80 → 1399.66] it's going to be.
[1400.38 → 1401.38] The Son of God
[1401.38 → 1402.78] for the sake of the world
[1402.78 → 1403.80] is going to be
[1403.80 → 1404.58] once and for all
[1404.58 → 1406.24] the atoning sacrifice
[1406.24 → 1408.18] that will forgive us,
[1408.40 → 1408.92] rescue us,
[1408.96 → 1409.60] and set us free.
[1409.70 → 1410.36] Praise the Lord.
[1411.58 → 1412.72] But the word I love
[1412.72 → 1413.52] in this passage,
[1414.18 → 1415.04] the word that grips
[1415.04 → 1415.92] my own heart,
[1416.34 → 1417.64] is advocate.
[1417.64 → 1420.60] we imagine Jesus
[1420.60 → 1421.68] in so many ways,
[1421.82 → 1423.18] sometimes a very unhealthy
[1423.18 → 1423.82] and there is,
[1423.96 → 1424.40] I think,
[1424.46 → 1425.46] really distorted views
[1425.46 → 1426.10] we have of Jesus.
[1426.46 → 1427.50] But not only does Jesus
[1427.50 → 1428.50] once and for all
[1428.50 → 1429.32] deal with the power
[1429.32 → 1429.76] of sin,
[1429.88 → 1430.58] the power of Satan,
[1430.68 → 1431.14] the power of the
[1431.14 → 1431.86] idolatrous powers
[1431.86 → 1432.36] in this world
[1432.36 → 1433.60] and take it to the grave,
[1433.86 → 1435.02] he rises victorious
[1435.02 → 1436.12] and then ascends
[1436.12 → 1436.98] to be with the Father.
[1437.56 → 1438.52] And Romans 8 says,
[1438.74 → 1439.64] not only is the Spirit
[1439.64 → 1440.54] interceding for us
[1440.54 → 1441.30] with wordless groans,
[1441.60 → 1442.72] but Jesus Christ,
[1443.38 → 1444.42] your and my Saviour,
[1444.80 → 1445.64] is at the right hand
[1445.64 → 1446.18] of the Father
[1446.18 → 1447.96] interceding for us
[1447.96 → 1449.64] on our behalf.
[1450.50 → 1451.76] Is that how you view Jesus?
[1453.28 → 1454.06] I think there are
[1454.06 → 1454.90] so many extremes
[1454.90 → 1455.48] in the church
[1455.48 → 1456.66] about our view of Jesus.
[1456.80 → 1457.20] Sometimes,
[1457.66 → 1458.84] I think I encounter this
[1458.84 → 1459.66] probably more regularly,
[1459.86 → 1461.76] but we're so broken
[1461.76 → 1462.50] by our sin.
[1463.32 → 1464.44] We're so ashamed
[1464.44 → 1465.32] of the patterns
[1465.32 → 1466.26] of addiction.
[1466.56 → 1467.20] We're ashamed
[1467.20 → 1467.90] of these things
[1467.90 → 1469.06] that we just can't get over
[1469.06 → 1469.90] that we just think
[1469.90 → 1470.58] there's no way
[1470.58 → 1471.50] that God loves me.
[1471.76 → 1472.28] There's no way
[1472.28 → 1473.00] that work of Jesus
[1473.00 → 1473.72] is for me
[1473.72 → 1474.86] and we're just too far gone.
[1475.64 → 1476.82] I encounter that perspective
[1476.82 → 1478.50] in explicit and implicit ways
[1478.50 → 1479.48] in the church all the time.
[1479.68 → 1481.04] But the other extreme is
[1481.04 → 1483.64] that it's fine.
[1484.38 → 1485.58] There's no sin to deal with.
[1486.04 → 1486.72] It's all good,
[1486.80 → 1487.38] sort of what we see
[1487.38 → 1487.94] in this passage.
[1489.00 → 1490.36] And what John says to us
[1490.36 → 1491.10] is number one,
[1491.18 → 1492.18] the sin's far worse
[1492.18 → 1492.94] than you realize.
[1493.24 → 1494.46] The darkness you walk in
[1494.46 → 1495.08] is real.
[1495.52 → 1496.76] And the way you deal with it,
[1496.80 → 1497.76] the way you bring it
[1497.76 → 1498.48] to the Father
[1498.48 → 1500.22] is confession.
[1500.22 → 1503.18] And Jesus Christ
[1503.18 → 1504.56] delights
[1504.56 → 1505.92] in bringing mercy,
[1506.24 → 1506.50] forgiveness,
[1506.72 → 1507.68] and purity.
[1508.58 → 1508.98] One of the things
[1508.98 → 1509.92] I love about this passage
[1509.92 → 1510.88] is that the word
[1510.88 → 1511.42] that shows up
[1511.42 → 1512.18] is purified
[1512.18 → 1512.98] and purifying.
[1513.40 → 1514.06] And it's the image
[1514.06 → 1515.24] of this ongoing
[1515.24 → 1516.06] work of Jesus
[1516.06 → 1516.80] in our lives
[1516.80 → 1517.72] just to make us
[1517.72 → 1519.30] more and more like Him.
[1519.34 → 1520.16] Not only does He deal
[1520.16 → 1521.00] with the power of sin,
[1521.38 → 1522.76] but in ongoing ways
[1522.76 → 1523.72] we pray to Him,
[1523.90 → 1525.02] as we live in relationship
[1525.02 → 1525.38] with Him,
[1525.40 → 1526.12] He just continues
[1526.12 → 1527.16] to clean us up.
[1527.16 → 1528.22] He delights
[1528.22 → 1529.82] in shedding from our lives
[1529.82 → 1530.98] the desires that are sinful,
[1531.32 → 1532.72] the patterns that are unhealthy,
[1533.06 → 1534.02] and making us more
[1534.02 → 1535.64] and more and more
[1535.64 → 1537.08] like the Father.
[1538.42 → 1538.98] I don't know
[1538.98 → 1539.44] if you've ever heard
[1539.44 → 1540.16] this illustration
[1540.16 → 1541.90] about Michelangelo,
[1542.26 → 1543.50] the famous artist
[1543.50 → 1544.72] who did the statue of David.
[1545.48 → 1546.72] He had many people ask us,
[1546.78 → 1546.90] you know,
[1546.94 → 1547.54] how did you make
[1547.54 → 1548.64] this statue so beautiful?
[1549.16 → 1550.06] How did you do
[1550.06 → 1550.88] this work of art?
[1550.94 → 1552.10] And it took many, many years,
[1552.48 → 1553.12] but allegedly,
[1553.30 → 1553.86] and I always wonder
[1553.86 → 1554.68] if these are true stories,
[1554.74 → 1555.24] but allegedly,
[1555.52 → 1556.82] his answer to how he did it
[1556.82 → 1557.10] was,
[1557.16 → 1557.62] he said,
[1557.68 → 1558.88] I just kept chipping away
[1558.88 → 1560.68] at all that wasn't David
[1560.68 → 1562.70] until all that was left
[1562.70 → 1564.74] was this statue of David.
[1565.64 → 1566.26] And I think that's
[1566.26 → 1567.00] the work of Jesus
[1567.00 → 1568.20] through the Spirit
[1568.20 → 1568.76] in our lives
[1568.76 → 1570.24] from now until Jesus returns
[1570.24 → 1571.20] or now until our death,
[1571.40 → 1572.44] just chipping away,
[1572.88 → 1573.44] purifying,
[1573.64 → 1573.98] cleansing,
[1574.36 → 1575.04] making us reflect
[1575.04 → 1576.06] more and more beautifully
[1576.06 → 1577.56] His own life
[1577.56 → 1578.36] and His own love.
[1580.98 → 1582.50] Tim Keller said it really well,
[1582.64 → 1583.38] and I'll repeat him.
[1583.94 → 1584.26] He says,
[1584.32 → 1585.98] we often imagine Jesus
[1585.98 → 1586.94] in distorted ways,
[1586.94 → 1587.70] but let us remember
[1587.70 → 1589.14] that Jesus is far more eager
[1589.14 → 1590.76] to forgive and to cleanse
[1590.76 → 1592.92] than we are to ask
[1592.92 → 1593.60] for forgiveness
[1593.60 → 1594.98] and mercy.
[1596.74 → 1598.08] He loves
[1598.08 → 1599.48] bringing healing
[1599.48 → 1600.22] and renewal,
[1600.84 → 1602.02] not just in the abstract,
[1602.74 → 1604.42] but to the very concrete,
[1604.62 → 1605.12] specific,
[1605.30 → 1605.84] broken pieces
[1605.84 → 1606.58] of your life.
[1607.62 → 1608.52] And John's invitation
[1608.52 → 1609.32] to every one of us,
[1609.44 → 1610.68] whatever the stuff is
[1610.68 → 1611.32] we face,
[1611.32 → 1613.58] is to practice confession.
[1615.14 → 1616.38] Don't bury the sin.
[1617.08 → 1618.38] Don't deny its existence.
[1618.54 → 1619.28] Don't minimize it.
[1619.36 → 1620.08] Don't conceal it.
[1620.20 → 1621.38] Bring it to the light.
[1621.98 → 1622.82] Bring it to the one
[1622.82 → 1623.94] who's already defeated
[1623.94 → 1625.24] its power by the cross,
[1625.52 → 1626.82] the one who brings us
[1626.82 → 1627.42] into fellowship
[1627.42 → 1628.18] with the Father
[1628.18 → 1629.44] and brings purity
[1629.44 → 1630.14] and cleansing
[1630.14 → 1631.18] to our lives.
[1631.18 → 1633.02] Amen?
[1635.52 → 1636.66] I'd like us to practice
[1636.66 → 1637.38] what we preach
[1637.38 → 1638.10] for a few minutes.
[1638.92 → 1639.86] And I'd like to lead us
[1639.86 → 1640.82] in a prayer of confession.
[1641.02 → 1641.58] And I'm going to leave
[1641.58 → 1642.74] little breaks
[1642.74 → 1643.72] where there's silence.
[1643.94 → 1644.48] And to the degree
[1644.48 → 1645.26] you want to pray
[1645.26 → 1646.64] into the words I'm speaking,
[1646.74 → 1647.20] I'm going to give you
[1647.20 → 1648.12] the freedom to do that.
[1648.38 → 1649.32] And after we pray
[1649.32 → 1650.12] words of confession,
[1650.12 → 1651.02] we're going to celebrate
[1651.02 → 1651.90] the grace of Jesus
[1651.90 → 1652.60] through communion.
[1652.60 → 1652.70] communion.
[1653.70 → 1654.68] Join me in prayer.
[1665.14 → 1666.16] Father, we acknowledge
[1666.16 → 1667.18] that you are the one
[1667.18 → 1667.96] who leads us
[1667.96 → 1668.68] out of darkness
[1668.68 → 1669.68] and into light.
[1671.46 → 1672.44] You're the one
[1672.44 → 1672.96] that leads us
[1672.96 → 1673.62] from slavery
[1673.62 → 1674.78] into freedom.
[1676.18 → 1677.62] It is you who leads us
[1677.62 → 1678.34] from despair
[1678.34 → 1679.84] into joy.
[1681.30 → 1682.34] And now we come
[1682.34 → 1683.18] to you asking
[1683.18 → 1683.92] for your mercy
[1683.92 → 1684.78] and your grace.
[1686.46 → 1687.84] Would you forgive us
[1687.84 → 1688.70] for rejecting
[1688.70 → 1689.68] your instruction?
[1690.90 → 1692.12] For neglecting
[1692.12 → 1692.78] and denying
[1692.78 → 1694.04] your word?
[1695.54 → 1696.58] For avoiding
[1696.58 → 1697.78] the good news
[1697.78 → 1698.42] of your scripture?
[1712.34 → 1720.00] Father, would you forgive us
[1720.00 → 1721.86] for that which comes
[1721.86 → 1722.62] out of our mouths?
[1724.26 → 1725.12] Foolish words,
[1726.36 → 1727.44] destructive words,
[1728.74 → 1729.58] angry words,
[1730.92 → 1731.44] lies,
[1732.10 → 1732.56] and gossip.
[1732.56 → 1757.76] Father, would you forgive us
[1757.76 → 1759.18] for our destructive habits?
[1759.18 → 1762.58] whether it's hidden addiction,
[1764.10 → 1765.28] whether it's laziness,
[1766.10 → 1767.18] whether it's just
[1767.18 → 1768.38] a poor way of living
[1768.38 → 1769.84] with people we are to love,
[1770.26 → 1771.44] but perhaps find ourselves
[1771.44 → 1771.80] hating,
[1772.90 → 1773.70] would you meet us
[1773.70 → 1774.24] in the areas
[1774.24 → 1775.22] where we are broken
[1775.22 → 1776.74] within in our habits
[1776.74 → 1777.90] and our lifestyles?
[1777.90 → 1791.56] Father,
[1791.56 → 1806.28] forgive us
[1806.28 → 1807.28] for concealing
[1807.28 → 1808.04] our sin,
[1809.74 → 1810.54] desperately trying
[1810.54 → 1811.16] to hide it
[1811.16 → 1811.88] from others,
[1812.96 → 1813.82] our loved ones,
[1814.82 → 1815.60] and from you.
[1815.60 → 1836.66] forgive us,
[1836.76 → 1836.96] Father.
[1838.76 → 1839.92] Embrace us again
[1839.92 → 1840.60] in your mercy
[1840.60 → 1842.94] and reveal to us
[1842.94 → 1844.78] the inexhaustible grace
[1844.78 → 1845.98] that we have
[1845.98 → 1846.46] in your Son,
[1846.54 → 1847.28] Jesus Christ.
[1848.22 → 1848.58] Amen.
[1853.90 → 1854.58] This time,
[1854.64 → 1855.26] we're going to celebrate
[1855.26 → 1856.00] communion together.
