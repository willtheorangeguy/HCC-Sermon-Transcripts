[0.00 → 4.84] Good morning.
[11.56 → 13.70] It's a privilege to be with you
[13.70 → 18.28] and to look at God's word with you this morning.
[19.64 → 22.18] We are going to be concluding our series
[22.18 → 24.78] on Paul's letter to the Galatians,
[24.78 → 28.52] a letter that Paul yells at us
[28.52 → 29.46] to make sure we're listening.
[29.46 → 31.06] That's kind of the picture we have.
[32.62 → 37.06] Last week, Pastor Dave in his sermon
[37.06 → 38.46] talked about freedom
[38.46 → 41.80] and the freedom to live as God calls us to live.
[43.22 → 45.80] Paul describes us as walking in the spirit
[45.80 → 47.58] versus walking in the flesh.
[49.06 → 51.78] He said the result of walking in the spirit
[51.78 → 52.84] are the fruits of the spirit,
[52.96 → 54.48] love, joy, peace, patient kindness,
[54.60 → 55.60] self-control, faithfulness,
[56.16 → 58.92] versus self-centred slavery
[58.92 → 61.12] when we walk in the flesh,
[61.66 → 64.82] when we think our freedom is to act out
[64.82 → 66.08] all the desires we have,
[66.14 → 67.76] and yet we find ourselves enslaved.
[69.02 → 71.62] And they are places that don't bear fruit
[71.62 → 74.26] because they are actually dead places
[74.26 → 75.86] where we're trying to find live things.
[75.86 → 82.44] And Galatians would say this is all about life in the gospel,
[83.96 → 85.00] gospel living,
[85.36 → 87.40] which is what we're trying to do every week.
[88.90 → 91.58] Martin Luther, the great reformer,
[91.66 → 93.30] summed up Galatians like this.
[94.36 → 94.74] He said,
[94.74 → 97.54] The truth of the gospel is also the principle
[97.54 → 99.00] of all Christian doctrine.
[99.12 → 99.90] Doctrine is belief.
[100.50 → 101.70] Where in the knowledge,
[101.90 → 105.34] in the knowledge of all godliness consists,
[106.34 → 108.08] most necessary it is therefore
[108.08 → 111.02] that we should know this gospel well,
[111.74 → 112.90] teach it to others,
[113.14 → 116.34] and beat it continually into their heads.
[116.34 → 119.22] Only Luther would say it that way.
[120.38 → 121.50] But I guess I'm going to say now,
[121.62 → 123.42] be prepared for yourselves
[123.42 → 125.04] to receive another beating,
[125.62 → 127.18] since that's what I'm here for.
[128.62 → 130.46] We've come to chapter 6,
[131.10 → 132.32] and we can easily read it
[132.32 → 135.04] kind of like a set of detached statements.
[135.16 → 136.24] It feels that way sometimes,
[136.46 → 137.90] kind of like standalone Proverbs.
[138.76 → 140.24] Bear each other's burdens.
[140.42 → 141.30] God is not mocked.
[141.38 → 144.00] But it actually does stand together fairly well,
[144.00 → 147.64] especially if I start with chapter 5, 26.
[148.20 → 149.70] I was reading some commentaries,
[150.24 → 153.50] and they think that that last verse of chapter 5
[153.50 → 155.18] should have actually been part of 6,
[155.62 → 159.90] reminding us that these chapters and verses are added.
[160.32 → 162.22] We just added all those things
[162.22 → 163.68] to kind of make it easier to read the Bible.
[164.08 → 167.56] So I'm going to put verse 26 in with chapter 6.
[168.88 → 171.22] In the first part of the chapter,
[171.84 → 173.42] Paul's talking about a heart condition,
[173.42 → 175.88] and that heart condition leads to certain behaviours.
[176.46 → 177.28] And then the last part,
[177.50 → 179.12] how do we solve this heart condition
[179.12 → 181.86] with real living in the gospel?
[182.22 → 183.40] So that's kind of where we're going.
[184.16 → 186.02] So let's read the whole thing together.
[186.12 → 187.48] A little bit long, but bear with me.
[188.18 → 190.68] Galatians 5, 26, and then chapter 6.
[192.10 → 195.00] Let us not become conceited,
[195.62 → 198.40] provoking and envying each other.
[199.60 → 200.54] Brothers and sisters,
[200.54 → 202.44] if someone is caught in a sin,
[203.44 → 205.38] you who live by the Spirit
[205.38 → 208.56] should restore that person gently.
[209.70 → 210.78] But watch yourselves,
[210.90 → 213.04] or you also may be tempted.
[213.70 → 215.14] Carry each other's burdens,
[215.50 → 218.32] and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
[219.32 → 221.30] If anyone thinks they are something
[221.30 → 222.22] when they are not,
[222.34 → 224.02] they deceive themselves.
[225.04 → 227.10] Each one should test their own actions.
[227.10 → 229.62] Then they can take pride in themselves alone
[229.62 → 231.78] without comparing themselves to someone else.
[232.50 → 235.00] For each one should carry their own load.
[235.86 → 236.14] Nevertheless,
[236.40 → 238.48] one who receives instruction in the Word
[238.48 → 241.24] should share all good things with their instructor.
[241.42 → 242.76] Do not be deceived.
[243.36 → 244.56] God cannot be mocked.
[245.06 → 246.50] A man reaps what he sows,
[246.94 → 249.56] and whoever sows to please the flesh,
[250.10 → 252.36] from the flesh will reap destruction.
[252.36 → 255.36] Whoever sows to please the Spirit,
[255.74 → 258.36] from the Spirit will reap eternal life.
[259.26 → 261.28] So let's not become weary in doing good,
[261.40 → 262.56] for at the proper time,
[262.88 → 265.50] we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
[266.44 → 266.88] And therefore,
[267.16 → 268.40] as we have opportunity,
[268.62 → 270.12] let us do good to all people,
[270.38 → 272.58] especially to those who belong to the family of believers.
[273.66 → 275.62] You see what large letters I use
[275.62 → 277.80] as I write you with my own hand?
[277.80 → 281.24] Those who want to impress people by means of the flesh
[281.24 → 283.40] are trying to compel you to be circumcised.
[283.48 → 284.46] That was the issue of the day.
[285.18 → 286.26] The only reason they do this
[286.26 → 289.28] is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ,
[289.92 → 291.16] which they were afraid of.
[291.66 → 293.94] Not even those who are circumcised keep the law,
[294.00 → 295.72] yet they want you to be circumcised
[295.72 → 299.92] that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh.
[300.88 → 304.78] May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[304.78 → 307.90] through which the world has been crucified to me
[307.90 → 309.52] and I to the world.
[310.56 → 312.86] Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
[312.86 → 313.88] means anything at all.
[313.94 → 316.06] What counts is the new creation.
[316.92 → 318.88] Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule,
[319.32 → 320.72] to the Israel of God.
[321.00 → 323.06] From now on, let no one cause me trouble,
[323.34 → 325.64] for I bear on my body the marks of Christ.
[326.06 → 328.58] The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you,
[328.66 → 329.90] brothers and sisters.
[330.38 → 330.78] Amen.
[332.74 → 333.88] So there's Paul's letter.
[333.88 → 335.32] I'm on the end of it.
[336.22 → 338.36] He has two concerns here.
[338.98 → 341.46] A doctrinal one, which is a belief concern,
[342.20 → 344.32] and a situational concern.
[345.24 → 347.86] The doctrinal concern is this.
[348.52 → 353.62] The believers are losing their hold on justification.
[353.94 → 354.60] So what's justification?
[355.34 → 356.76] Justification by faith alone,
[357.08 → 361.38] on being right with God through faith and grace only.
[361.38 → 364.72] And Paul sees that slipping away a little bit.
[365.30 → 367.34] And then there's a situational concern,
[367.74 → 369.66] which is often the case over time,
[370.02 → 371.46] is for their unity.
[371.94 → 373.66] That they are not, as he says elsewhere,
[373.86 → 375.92] biting and devouring one another.
[376.40 → 378.80] He says, let's not become conceited.
[378.90 → 379.04] Right?
[379.08 → 380.62] You have a conflict going on.
[380.86 → 382.92] Now you can have this side demonizing this side,
[382.98 → 383.38] and so on.
[383.38 → 384.08] And so on.
[384.32 → 386.38] You know, let us not become conceited.
[386.46 → 387.54] Oh, I know best.
[388.64 → 390.82] Let us not be provoking one another.
[391.90 → 393.42] That never happens in churches, does it?
[395.78 → 396.22] Conceited.
[396.46 → 396.98] That word.
[397.14 → 399.04] It's a powerful word in its own way.
[399.04 → 401.76] But I like this old English translation of it,
[402.04 → 403.18] and it's vainglory.
[404.26 → 405.80] Maybe you've never heard of the word,
[405.90 → 407.22] but vainglory.
[407.66 → 410.18] It's from a Greek word meaning empty of glory.
[410.86 → 412.72] And you're after glory.
[413.76 → 416.12] You're trying to find it, but you can't.
[416.36 → 417.66] So it's vainglory.
[417.78 → 418.86] You're doing it in vain.
[419.82 → 422.48] This is one who is desperate for recognition.
[423.34 → 425.50] You sense an emptiness within,
[425.50 → 428.14] and you attempt to fill that emptiness
[428.14 → 432.04] with often people's affirmation and recognition.
[433.24 → 435.40] You're desperate to prove your worth.
[435.40 → 438.82] This is the heart condition Paul's talking about.
[440.26 → 442.86] And he reminds us that actually our deepest need
[442.86 → 445.16] is for us to hear from God,
[446.08 → 449.04] well done, you are good and faithful servant.
[452.08 → 454.06] Approval from God, Paul says,
[454.12 → 457.20] is our deepest need, whether we know it or not.
[458.78 → 461.82] And because when we don't have that,
[461.82 → 464.18] we then turn away from God.
[464.44 → 465.48] We fall again.
[465.74 → 468.84] We desperately try to fill that emptiness in other ways.
[469.20 → 470.52] Ways that can't work,
[470.88 → 473.28] and then create biting and devouring
[473.28 → 475.00] and all kinds of other evil.
[475.64 → 477.76] And then we miss out on what we read
[477.76 → 480.56] in Galatians 5.13,
[481.76 → 484.04] which was Dave preached on last week,
[484.50 → 485.72] when the key verse, he said,
[485.72 → 486.90] for you, my brothers and sisters,
[486.98 → 487.92] were called to be free.
[488.30 → 490.80] Do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh.
[491.10 → 492.76] Indulging the flesh is this devouring,
[492.90 → 494.54] this biting, and all that's part of that.
[495.10 → 499.24] But rather serve one another humbly in love.
[501.64 → 503.92] And then instead of serving in love,
[504.58 → 506.38] yeah, we do that biting and that devouring
[506.38 → 508.32] and that provoking and envy,
[508.52 → 509.64] and we get conceited.
[509.64 → 514.02] And then all the relationships are all about
[514.02 → 517.48] what can I get out of this relationship?
[517.88 → 520.02] Am I getting affirmed?
[521.80 → 524.74] Am I feeling my self-centred emptiness?
[528.36 → 528.88] Envying.
[529.78 → 532.22] We could call that inferiority complex, right?
[532.24 → 533.22] You're always comparing.
[533.72 → 535.04] Maybe you feel this way sometimes,
[535.18 → 535.90] maybe you know people like that.
[536.14 → 537.98] You're always comparing all the time,
[537.98 → 540.06] and then you're angry that you don't measure up,
[540.40 → 541.62] whatever that standard might be.
[542.60 → 543.98] Or else you're provoking.
[544.40 → 545.74] You're always competing.
[546.10 → 547.84] You have a superiority complex.
[548.26 → 549.32] You know you're right.
[549.56 → 550.88] You're smarter than everybody else.
[551.32 → 552.30] You can beat anyone.
[555.38 → 558.98] And neither one of those leads to service nor love.
[560.82 → 563.20] And then when you read in verses 6, 1, 5,
[563.20 → 565.48] Paul says this is then how we work
[565.48 → 566.78] against self-centred living.
[566.78 → 570.56] We do things like we restore someone gently.
[570.96 → 571.58] What are we doing?
[571.66 → 573.86] We're paying attention to each other's lives.
[573.98 → 576.94] Not to judge, just to pay attention.
[577.54 → 579.00] Because love pays attention.
[579.54 → 582.22] And then when we see something that's not working,
[582.42 → 583.44] you know it's harmful,
[583.78 → 587.12] you look at them to restore gently.
[588.82 → 591.94] Not to punch them in the face with your brilliance.
[591.94 → 597.06] And Paul warns right away here.
[597.06 → 599.84] He says, before you restore gently,
[600.42 → 602.06] keep an eye on yourself.
[602.22 → 604.52] Watch yourself, lest you be tempted.
[604.78 → 608.12] In other words, you might fall just like that person fell
[608.12 → 609.66] into whatever that might be.
[609.92 → 612.10] So you could fall in the same way.
[612.36 → 612.98] So watch it.
[613.22 → 614.86] You could be tempted too.
[614.86 → 619.24] And then you go to restore on equal ground.
[619.64 → 620.84] You're not better.
[624.48 → 626.34] And then when you look at that person,
[626.50 → 628.96] this example, you know somebody who's abrasive.
[629.28 → 631.92] Somebody who doesn't build relationships particularly well.
[632.14 → 634.28] Maybe someone who even has a hard time keeping a job.
[634.28 → 636.04] Or you see someone else who's stuck
[636.04 → 637.62] in some kind of harmful behaviours.
[637.98 → 638.92] They've got addiction.
[639.10 → 640.72] They've got behavioural problems.
[640.82 → 641.54] They make trouble.
[641.92 → 642.78] They're in trouble.
[643.06 → 645.20] Maybe they've been caught doing something wrong.
[645.50 → 647.60] Some kind of character flaw or flaws.
[647.96 → 648.90] And you see that.
[649.24 → 652.12] And then Paul says, yeah, before you go to all that,
[652.46 → 653.54] check yourself.
[655.32 → 656.72] Check where you're at.
[659.16 → 661.14] Make sure you're going at this humbly.
[661.14 → 664.92] Then you can serve that person.
[665.48 → 668.18] The vainglory person will figure,
[668.84 → 671.94] how can I look good in this serving thing?
[672.96 → 675.78] I sure hope people notice me when I'm serving.
[676.82 → 679.80] And they're using that to look good.
[680.36 → 682.02] They're not serving you.
[682.36 → 683.50] They're using you.
[684.56 → 687.02] It's not about helping to restore gently.
[687.30 → 689.12] It's about improving their image.
[689.12 → 690.38] Look at me.
[691.80 → 692.96] That person, by the way,
[693.06 → 695.06] when things start to get too much,
[695.68 → 696.48] and I don't know about you,
[696.56 → 697.56] but if you've helped people
[697.56 → 698.72] and walked alongside people
[698.72 → 699.80] and wanted to restore gently,
[700.32 → 702.36] and it's not an easy process,
[702.62 → 704.58] and you're going to want to bail out sometime
[704.58 → 707.06] because the cost is going to be too high.
[707.06 → 714.98] It starts with a heart that's being filled with the Spirit of God,
[715.20 → 717.02] and out of that comes that fruit.
[717.44 → 719.64] Things like, and I want to highlight this one,
[719.92 → 721.98] things like kindness.
[725.60 → 727.54] I think we, oh, kindness.
[727.94 → 730.86] You know, I think kindness, it's a spiritual gift.
[730.86 → 734.48] When you say things, do you say them kindly?
[737.78 → 741.46] When you approach people, do you do so with kindness?
[743.46 → 746.86] And that's restoring, part of restoring gently.
[746.86 → 751.90] So this comes when I'm in touch with the Spirit.
[753.10 → 754.96] And then I know how to keep going.
[755.04 → 755.20] Why?
[755.30 → 756.48] Well, I have forbearance.
[756.52 → 757.56] This is one of the spiritual gifts.
[757.94 → 759.44] When you're a mess,
[760.02 → 761.86] I don't bail on you.
[761.86 → 767.30] I have forbearance.
[770.14 → 771.28] Paul goes on to say,
[771.82 → 773.02] bear with one another.
[773.18 → 774.02] Bear one another.
[774.42 → 776.84] I'm not going to let you carry that alone.
[780.08 → 781.92] Yeah, you know, I get it.
[782.24 → 784.06] When I step into that with you,
[784.20 → 785.86] that's going to weigh me down.
[786.10 → 787.20] But that's okay,
[787.46 → 789.50] because love is about serving.
[789.82 → 791.20] Freedom is about serving.
[791.86 → 794.10] I'm free in Christ to help you,
[794.32 → 795.88] because he saved me,
[796.20 → 797.84] he unburdens me.
[800.96 → 804.44] Love is about a willingness to help carry a burden.
[805.26 → 806.92] I'll take some of that weight
[806.92 → 808.46] so you can walk a little bit easier.
[808.78 → 811.24] Is your problem going to now be automatically solved?
[811.36 → 812.12] Probably not.
[812.30 → 813.92] But you're walking a little bit of lighter,
[814.20 → 816.78] and then maybe you have time to get healthier again
[816.78 → 817.90] and seek some help
[817.90 → 819.40] and get a little bit more support
[819.40 → 821.54] so you can start walking more on your own,
[821.60 → 822.52] which is what we want.
[826.52 → 828.88] And at least you're not alone with that burden.
[828.88 → 833.86] I'm always surprised, you know,
[833.90 → 834.90] when I talk to people
[834.90 → 837.10] and they share a little bit of their lives.
[839.78 → 841.08] You know, on the one hand,
[841.18 → 841.74] you feel, okay,
[842.20 → 843.96] you took on a wee bit of burden.
[844.50 → 845.08] But on the other hand,
[845.12 → 845.84] what a blessing.
[846.26 → 848.06] And somehow it builds you,
[848.22 → 850.54] and hopefully it supports the other person, right?
[850.54 → 853.64] It just makes life richer.
[856.06 → 859.58] And this isn't about you feeling good about yourself.
[859.66 → 860.92] That's not the main point here.
[861.32 → 862.88] You aren't the point.
[865.00 → 866.08] That's what Paul's trying to say here.
[866.44 → 867.34] Restore gently.
[867.72 → 868.40] Bear the burden.
[868.70 → 870.18] The other is the focus
[870.18 → 871.56] because you know what it's like
[871.56 → 872.92] to feel burdened and overwhelmed,
[873.10 → 874.52] and then have Christ show up
[874.52 → 876.90] and fill your life with his spirit,
[877.10 → 878.54] and then you become unburdened.
[878.54 → 879.10] Unburdened.
[879.24 → 880.52] Do all the problems go away?
[880.58 → 880.78] No.
[881.00 → 882.84] But somehow you're unburdened.
[886.78 → 888.94] And often Christ shows up for others
[888.94 → 891.68] with and through someone else too.
[892.38 → 893.64] People stepping into your lives,
[893.68 → 894.78] and Christ works through those people.
[898.44 → 902.98] You know, when Paul's talking about in verse 3,
[903.08 → 903.16] he says,
[903.40 → 905.30] if someone thinks they're something, and they're not,
[905.36 → 906.52] they deceive themselves, right?
[906.52 → 908.20] You know, again, saying,
[908.20 → 911.26] don't forget to stay humble.
[913.60 → 914.64] The second you're saying,
[914.86 → 918.02] well, you're pretty impressed with yourself.
[919.46 → 921.12] Well, you're on the wrong track here.
[921.70 → 922.78] We're something, right?
[923.00 → 924.22] Look at me and what I'm doing.
[925.10 → 925.92] He keeps saying it.
[926.12 → 927.44] Test your work.
[928.76 → 930.18] Keep an eye on your motives.
[930.50 → 931.92] This is about serving Jesus
[931.92 → 933.34] by serving those around you.
[933.34 → 936.42] Or is this about you and your empty ego?
[940.02 → 941.96] And then there's this stress here.
[942.34 → 944.46] Keep testing yourself.
[945.36 → 948.02] Because it's so easy to stray into self-righteousness
[948.02 → 949.12] than fall into temptation.
[949.62 → 951.02] Keep your eyes on Christ.
[951.10 → 952.84] One of my favourite verses, Hebrews 12.
[953.38 → 954.24] I love how it's written.
[954.24 → 955.52] He starts off saying,
[955.70 → 957.30] let us throw off everything that hinders
[957.30 → 958.82] and the sin that's so easily entangled.
[959.02 → 960.46] Like, throw that stuff aside.
[960.82 → 962.04] And then run with perseverance.
[962.44 → 963.74] The race marked out for you.
[964.10 → 964.46] How?
[965.30 → 966.90] Fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[968.02 → 969.64] pioneering the perfecter of our faith.
[972.60 → 973.54] Focused on Jesus.
[973.54 → 977.14] It's so easy to get focused
[977.14 → 978.98] on all kinds of other things.
[980.22 → 982.56] Jesus came, and he basically said,
[983.26 → 984.72] my life for you.
[985.72 → 987.24] My life for you.
[987.62 → 988.92] My life for you.
[989.82 → 991.14] That's how he lived his life.
[991.48 → 993.60] And then he calls us to do the same.
[993.96 → 995.64] And then we look into other people's lives
[995.64 → 997.02] and we say too,
[997.40 → 998.52] my life for you.
[999.76 → 1001.06] My life for you.
[1001.06 → 1006.48] But quickly we switch focus.
[1007.02 → 1008.64] And pretty soon we find ourselves in
[1008.64 → 1010.00] my life for me
[1010.00 → 1011.46] and your life for me too.
[1014.92 → 1016.10] And we're off track.
[1017.30 → 1018.54] Test your work.
[1019.02 → 1020.20] Check your focus.
[1020.54 → 1021.48] Is it on Christ?
[1022.74 → 1023.88] Great relationships,
[1024.14 → 1025.00] gospel relationships
[1025.00 → 1026.98] are all about my life for you
[1026.98 → 1028.24] because I know Jesus
[1028.24 → 1030.40] and I see him looking me in the eyes
[1030.40 → 1031.00] all the time
[1031.00 → 1032.04] and seeing him say,
[1032.38 → 1033.92] my life for you, Sid.
[1035.28 → 1036.44] My life for you.
[1036.64 → 1038.32] Now go out and live that.
[1041.58 → 1042.26] Every day,
[1042.66 → 1043.32] my life for you.
[1044.54 → 1045.76] And then serving becomes
[1045.76 → 1047.58] more and more natural.
[1050.16 → 1051.40] I was thinking of an example.
[1052.20 → 1053.24] Imagine parents
[1053.24 → 1054.26] who said,
[1054.32 → 1054.78] yeah, yeah, yeah,
[1054.78 → 1055.76] I want kids,
[1056.06 → 1057.32] but I don't want kids
[1057.32 → 1058.64] who mess with my lives
[1058.64 → 1059.40] and my schedule.
[1059.40 → 1065.42] Don't become a parent
[1065.42 → 1069.02] because that's how it goes.
[1069.78 → 1070.30] Right?
[1070.40 → 1071.36] That's not the pathway
[1071.36 → 1072.72] to love.
[1072.80 → 1074.14] Love is about serving,
[1074.36 → 1075.34] which means your schedules
[1075.34 → 1076.48] get messed with
[1076.48 → 1079.00] and there's lots of inconvenience.
[1079.00 → 1081.94] all of real life
[1081.94 → 1083.90] is about sacrifice.
[1084.32 → 1085.12] My life for you.
[1086.22 → 1086.90] That's the key
[1086.90 → 1087.72] to great parenting.
[1087.90 → 1088.16] It's the key
[1088.16 → 1089.00] to a great marriage.
[1089.12 → 1089.38] It's the key
[1089.38 → 1090.24] to great friendships.
[1090.62 → 1091.78] It's in great communities
[1091.78 → 1092.58] and great lives.
[1092.88 → 1093.26] Paul says,
[1093.32 → 1093.98] you get to choose.
[1094.20 → 1096.34] Choose the vain glory way
[1096.34 → 1098.30] where you're trying
[1098.30 → 1100.18] to fill your glory
[1100.18 → 1100.94] somehow
[1100.94 → 1102.14] or the way of Jesus.
[1102.14 → 1103.40] One of those ways
[1103.40 → 1104.16] has fruit
[1104.16 → 1105.44] and the other
[1105.44 → 1106.68] has nothing
[1106.68 → 1108.38] that brings life.
[1110.52 → 1111.46] So how do you get there?
[1112.44 → 1113.44] Kind of talks about that
[1113.44 → 1115.70] in verses 12 and 14.
[1115.78 → 1116.60] Paul at one point says,
[1117.18 → 1118.46] we are a whole new person.
[1118.84 → 1120.66] We're a whole new creation
[1120.66 → 1121.40] in Christ.
[1123.14 → 1124.42] And then he talks about,
[1124.48 → 1124.72] you know,
[1125.40 → 1126.90] some of them are boasting
[1126.90 → 1128.14] in the work they're doing
[1128.14 → 1129.16] in other people's lives
[1129.16 → 1130.20] when they convince them
[1130.20 → 1131.10] to get circumcised
[1131.10 → 1131.56] and all that.
[1131.74 → 1132.26] And they have this
[1132.26 → 1133.52] ulterior motive going on
[1133.52 → 1134.70] and it's not wholesome at all.
[1135.40 → 1135.88] But, you know,
[1135.94 → 1137.56] they're boasting in that.
[1138.68 → 1139.84] And then Paul responds,
[1140.38 → 1141.78] if I boast,
[1142.66 → 1143.70] if I boast,
[1143.94 → 1146.28] it is only in the cross.
[1149.54 → 1151.12] Vain glory people
[1151.12 → 1152.20] boast in all kinds of things, right?
[1152.26 → 1154.14] Money, success, strength, winning,
[1154.66 → 1156.20] how smart they are,
[1156.24 → 1156.94] all kinds of things.
[1157.26 → 1158.22] They're always boasting
[1158.22 → 1158.78] about something.
[1159.16 → 1161.08] I boast in Christ's sake
[1161.08 → 1162.60] saving me and transforming me,
[1162.94 → 1163.88] nothing else.
[1167.62 → 1169.40] If you want real transformation,
[1170.06 → 1171.68] that's the only boasting you can do.
[1172.76 → 1174.06] You focus on the cross.
[1174.62 → 1175.96] Well, how often do you focus
[1175.96 → 1176.42] on the cross?
[1176.54 → 1176.88] Daily.
[1177.58 → 1178.26] Pick up your cross,
[1178.34 → 1178.70] follow me.
[1179.50 → 1179.86] Daily.
[1180.28 → 1182.26] Things won't change
[1182.26 → 1184.04] until you start with
[1184.04 → 1186.26] and focus on
[1186.26 → 1188.12] the doctrine of atonement.
[1188.12 → 1188.68] What is that?
[1188.74 → 1192.38] The belief that you've been saved
[1192.38 → 1193.86] through the work of Christ.
[1194.06 → 1195.36] Well, that's kind of a one-time decision,
[1195.48 → 1195.74] isn't it?
[1195.92 → 1196.38] No.
[1196.70 → 1197.96] That's a daily thing.
[1198.20 → 1200.32] You focus daily on the cross.
[1200.56 → 1201.64] You focus on the fact
[1201.64 → 1203.76] that you have been saved
[1203.76 → 1205.22] because you needed it.
[1205.22 → 1207.90] But it's more than that.
[1209.58 → 1210.50] We're reading a book
[1210.50 → 1212.38] as a staff
[1212.38 → 1214.90] from John Mark Former
[1214.90 → 1216.68] called Practicing the Way.
[1218.06 → 1218.84] And at one point he says,
[1218.94 → 1220.48] salvation, rightly understood,
[1221.08 → 1222.90] is the healing of the whole person.
[1224.36 → 1225.18] Okay, so salvation
[1225.18 → 1226.68] isn't just a one-moment decision.
[1227.04 → 1228.20] That one-moment decision matters.
[1228.52 → 1228.82] But it's not,
[1228.96 → 1230.16] salvation is much more than that.
[1230.52 → 1232.50] It's this whole person
[1232.50 → 1234.96] that needs to be saved
[1234.96 → 1235.86] and renewed
[1235.86 → 1236.72] and transformed
[1236.72 → 1238.26] for the rest of your life.
[1238.96 → 1240.18] And then John Mark Former goes on.
[1240.22 → 1240.46] He says,
[1240.70 → 1243.02] so we can't self-save
[1243.02 → 1245.80] and we have been saved
[1245.80 → 1247.32] and are being saved
[1247.32 → 1248.60] and will be saved
[1248.60 → 1250.46] by Jesus and Him alone.
[1254.12 → 1254.64] Oh.
[1255.96 → 1257.14] You mean it's not just saying
[1257.14 → 1257.90] I believe that?
[1258.22 → 1259.44] You mean it's the transformation
[1259.44 → 1260.74] of everything about me?
[1260.94 → 1261.26] Yes.
[1261.78 → 1262.66] Yeah, that's what it is.
[1263.70 → 1265.34] And so we focus on the cross.
[1265.58 → 1266.76] We focus on Christ
[1266.76 → 1267.68] and His work.
[1267.94 → 1269.84] We start there every time.
[1270.50 → 1271.10] Too many,
[1271.26 → 1272.36] too many Christians
[1272.36 → 1273.86] forget that they actually
[1273.86 → 1275.40] needed a Saviour
[1275.40 → 1276.72] and still do.
[1280.18 → 1281.30] It's interesting to me.
[1282.00 → 1283.42] I see Jesus throughout the gospel
[1283.42 → 1284.50] trying to get His disciples
[1284.50 → 1286.10] to grasp their need
[1286.10 → 1287.20] for a Saviour on the cross.
[1287.62 → 1288.40] I'm going to read a little bit
[1288.40 → 1289.36] out of Matthew 16.
[1289.70 → 1290.44] But just setting up,
[1290.74 → 1291.38] Jesus and the disciples
[1291.38 → 1292.22] walk along and,
[1292.78 → 1293.02] you know,
[1293.16 → 1293.94] at one point,
[1294.62 → 1295.26] Peter says,
[1295.86 → 1296.54] when Christ says,
[1296.60 → 1297.36] who am I?
[1297.62 → 1298.00] Peter says,
[1298.04 → 1298.68] you are the Christ,
[1298.74 → 1299.48] the Son of the living God.
[1299.74 → 1299.90] Right?
[1299.98 → 1301.32] And then Jesus said,
[1301.64 → 1303.02] that was revealed to you
[1303.02 → 1303.64] by the Spirit.
[1303.80 → 1304.00] Right?
[1304.34 → 1305.90] And then we get right away,
[1306.38 → 1307.64] right after that,
[1307.72 → 1308.58] we come to this.
[1310.58 → 1311.46] Matthew 16.
[1311.46 → 1313.74] From that time on,
[1313.84 → 1314.80] Jesus began to explain
[1314.80 → 1315.46] to His disciples
[1315.46 → 1317.16] that He must go to Jerusalem,
[1317.58 → 1318.30] suffer many things
[1318.30 → 1319.22] at the hands of the elders,
[1319.52 → 1320.30] the chief priests,
[1320.42 → 1321.30] the teachers of the law,
[1321.64 → 1323.04] that He must be killed
[1323.04 → 1324.58] and on the third day
[1324.58 → 1326.02] be raised to life.
[1326.98 → 1327.96] Peter took Him aside
[1327.96 → 1329.36] and began to rebuke Him.
[1329.64 → 1330.26] Never, Lord,
[1330.30 → 1330.58] He said,
[1330.72 → 1332.66] this shall never happen to you.
[1334.24 → 1335.72] Jesus turned and said to Peter,
[1336.42 → 1337.80] get behind me, Satan.
[1338.70 → 1340.14] You are a stumbling block to me
[1340.14 → 1342.42] and you do not have the mind
[1342.42 → 1344.26] of the concerns of God,
[1344.54 → 1345.66] but merely human concerns.
[1346.82 → 1348.20] And then Jesus said to His disciples,
[1348.32 → 1349.96] whoever wants to be My disciple
[1349.96 → 1351.56] must deny themselves,
[1352.16 → 1353.08] take up their cross,
[1353.92 → 1354.98] and follow Me.
[1357.66 → 1358.34] Notice here,
[1359.38 → 1360.50] at one point Peter is saying,
[1360.60 → 1361.18] you are the Christ,
[1362.28 → 1363.14] but now he's saying,
[1363.28 → 1365.20] but let Me define Christ for you.
[1365.20 → 1367.48] He's saying,
[1367.94 → 1368.38] Jesus said,
[1368.58 → 1369.52] get behind me, Satan.
[1369.64 → 1369.86] He's saying,
[1369.94 → 1371.04] get behind me, Peter, here,
[1371.28 → 1372.86] because He's basically saying
[1372.86 → 1375.58] that Satan wants you, Peter,
[1375.66 → 1376.96] to believe that the cross
[1376.96 → 1378.32] isn't necessary.
[1381.30 → 1383.28] There's another way, right, Peter?
[1383.38 → 1384.28] It's usually through you
[1384.28 → 1384.78] and your sword,
[1385.04 → 1386.38] but there's another way.
[1390.78 → 1393.70] Don't focus on your profound need
[1393.70 → 1394.68] for a Saviour.
[1400.02 → 1400.58] Every morning,
[1400.64 → 1401.60] we should be looking in the mirror
[1401.60 → 1402.20] and saying,
[1402.28 → 1403.34] God loves this guy,
[1403.78 → 1404.22] this gal.
[1404.56 → 1406.26] God loves me so much
[1406.26 → 1407.98] and He died for me
[1407.98 → 1410.56] and He's saving me today too.
[1410.56 → 1417.00] And if,
[1418.24 → 1419.28] in order to believe that,
[1419.34 → 1420.50] you need to focus on the cross
[1420.50 → 1421.82] daily,
[1423.30 → 1424.16] rather than look at
[1424.16 → 1425.20] how amazing you've become
[1425.20 → 1426.36] or the opposite,
[1426.46 → 1427.68] how useless you are.
[1428.64 → 1429.32] Because we can go down
[1429.32 → 1430.04] that path too
[1430.04 → 1430.88] and it's another path
[1430.88 → 1431.80] the devil likes to use.
[1433.10 → 1434.28] The devil's basically saying,
[1434.42 → 1435.48] just make sure
[1435.48 → 1437.56] you focus on you.
[1437.56 → 1441.24] that you focus on you.
[1441.32 → 1441.98] Make sure that that's
[1441.98 → 1442.54] where you stay.
[1443.36 → 1443.86] Start with,
[1444.00 → 1444.68] and Paul is saying,
[1444.74 → 1445.18] no, no, no, no,
[1445.18 → 1446.22] start with the cross
[1446.22 → 1447.00] all the time.
[1447.96 → 1448.06] Right?
[1448.30 → 1448.50] Yeah,
[1448.72 → 1450.12] you people are trying
[1450.12 → 1451.04] to impress with what
[1451.04 → 1451.40] you're doing
[1451.40 → 1452.96] with the whole circumcision thing.
[1453.66 → 1455.84] And these were followers too
[1455.84 → 1457.72] and they're kind of,
[1458.10 → 1458.30] say,
[1458.38 → 1458.60] yeah, yeah,
[1458.60 → 1459.02] of course,
[1459.10 → 1459.60] of course,
[1459.76 → 1460.06] Jesus,
[1460.24 → 1460.82] of course.
[1461.90 → 1462.28] Yeah, yeah,
[1462.30 → 1462.46] yeah,
[1462.46 → 1462.88] the cross,
[1462.94 → 1463.70] of course.
[1465.28 → 1465.62] But hey,
[1465.94 → 1466.52] circumcision.
[1466.52 → 1466.60] circumcision.
[1467.56 → 1468.14] And we're back
[1468.14 → 1468.76] to what we started
[1468.76 → 1469.46] earlier on.
[1469.76 → 1470.32] We're back to
[1470.32 → 1472.08] Jesus plus.
[1475.12 → 1476.70] Jesus plus something else.
[1476.96 → 1477.46] Yeah, yeah, yeah,
[1477.46 → 1477.58] yeah,
[1477.58 → 1478.00] the cross,
[1478.08 → 1478.34] yeah, yeah,
[1478.34 → 1478.56] sure.
[1479.04 → 1480.28] But this,
[1480.36 → 1481.08] you've got to believe this.
[1481.28 → 1482.06] You've got to say this.
[1482.22 → 1483.20] You've got to act like this.
[1484.54 → 1485.34] And Paul keeps saying,
[1485.40 → 1485.82] no, no, no.
[1487.40 → 1487.80] Jesus,
[1488.16 → 1488.68] the cross,
[1488.98 → 1489.68] you need saving.
[1490.02 → 1490.82] That's the point.
[1490.82 → 1490.88] That's the point.
[1494.78 → 1495.18] Yeah,
[1495.22 → 1495.34] but,
[1495.34 → 1496.54] you know,
[1496.54 → 1497.54] and the cross,
[1498.56 → 1499.96] Paul said it,
[1500.02 → 1501.02] he said it right here,
[1501.30 → 1502.26] the cross is offensive.
[1504.56 → 1505.08] The cross is offensive.
[1505.28 → 1505.92] Bertrand Russell,
[1506.06 → 1506.76] a famous philosopher,
[1506.98 → 1507.84] described the cross
[1507.84 → 1509.76] as a doctrine of cruelty.
[1515.30 → 1516.46] Lots of people like,
[1516.64 → 1516.80] you know,
[1516.86 → 1517.00] they say,
[1517.04 → 1517.16] ah,
[1517.16 → 1517.98] religion's good.
[1518.12 → 1518.64] It's good.
[1518.96 → 1519.36] Morality,
[1519.50 → 1520.06] a little morality,
[1520.16 → 1520.84] that's good for us.
[1520.84 → 1522.60] The cross,
[1522.80 → 1522.96] well,
[1523.12 → 1523.96] nice piece of jewellery,
[1524.46 → 1525.42] but offensive otherwise.
[1529.50 → 1530.32] And I've seen it
[1530.32 → 1531.10] in people's eyes.
[1531.84 → 1533.30] Are you saying
[1533.30 → 1535.80] that I need saving?
[1538.86 → 1540.58] That I'm not good enough
[1540.58 → 1541.38] by myself,
[1541.72 → 1542.98] even though I'm obviously
[1542.98 → 1544.52] extremely successful?
[1544.52 → 1544.66] people,
[1545.66 → 1552.10] Jesus is a stumbling block
[1552.10 → 1552.56] for many,
[1552.76 → 1554.06] many who don't want
[1554.06 → 1554.96] to hear that they
[1554.96 → 1556.32] in the core of their being
[1556.32 → 1558.06] need a saviour.
[1561.30 → 1562.20] Do you need one?
[1562.20 → 1567.94] And then Paul goes further
[1567.94 → 1568.26] and he says,
[1568.44 → 1570.28] that's what we need
[1570.28 → 1570.76] to boast in.
[1571.44 → 1572.36] We've got to boast
[1572.36 → 1573.12] in the cross.
[1573.84 → 1574.76] Boast in what Jesus
[1574.76 → 1575.32] has done.
[1577.22 → 1578.02] Paul says this
[1578.02 → 1578.74] in a bunch of different
[1578.74 → 1579.38] places, right?
[1579.60 → 1580.32] Boast in the cross.
[1581.04 → 1582.34] And boast is the word
[1582.34 → 1583.12] that actually comes
[1583.12 → 1583.66] out of warfare.
[1584.82 → 1586.04] It's when the general
[1586.04 → 1586.74] or the leader
[1586.74 → 1589.08] in the military there
[1589.08 → 1590.36] would say to these people
[1590.36 → 1590.86] that are about
[1590.86 → 1591.82] to have to charge
[1591.82 → 1593.76] into the jaws of death
[1593.76 → 1596.10] and he had to pump them up
[1596.10 → 1597.58] and that was a word
[1597.58 → 1598.14] for boast.
[1598.62 → 1599.40] And he would say things
[1599.40 → 1599.58] like,
[1599.80 → 1601.36] our hands are strong enough,
[1601.70 → 1602.88] our weapons mighty,
[1603.22 → 1604.26] our cause righteous,
[1604.72 → 1605.34] charge!
[1607.84 → 1609.30] That boast would lead
[1609.30 → 1610.08] them into that.
[1611.82 → 1612.08] See,
[1612.26 → 1613.04] I see it all the time.
[1613.10 → 1614.56] I'm a big fan of the NFL.
[1614.78 → 1615.56] I like watching football.
[1615.94 → 1616.94] Going to watch the Super Bowl
[1616.94 → 1617.30] today.
[1618.14 → 1618.70] Go Chiefs.
[1619.92 → 1620.18] Anyway,
[1620.18 → 1622.62] probably shouldn't have
[1622.62 → 1623.32] said that out loud.
[1625.74 → 1626.46] But you see that,
[1626.50 → 1626.60] you know,
[1626.64 → 1627.62] one guy will pump up
[1627.62 → 1628.52] the guys before they
[1628.52 → 1629.02] get out in the field.
[1629.10 → 1629.88] Same kind of thing.
[1630.28 → 1630.40] Right?
[1630.52 → 1630.76] You know,
[1630.98 → 1632.78] we have what it takes
[1632.78 → 1633.52] to win.
[1636.14 → 1636.56] You know,
[1636.60 → 1637.32] Travis Kelsey,
[1637.50 → 1638.68] they had a speech,
[1638.90 → 1639.72] one of his little speeches
[1639.72 → 1640.66] involved one word.
[1641.04 → 1641.60] And all he did
[1641.60 → 1642.08] was look at all
[1642.08 → 1643.46] his fellow players
[1643.46 → 1643.78] and he'd go,
[1644.22 → 1644.64] more,
[1644.64 → 1644.74] more,
[1646.02 → 1646.74] more,
[1646.74 → 1647.74] more,
[1647.74 → 1647.82] more,
[1647.82 → 1648.74] more,
[1648.74 → 1649.74] more,
[1649.74 → 1649.80] more.
[1650.28 → 1651.06] He just kept saying it.
[1654.20 → 1654.64] Ooh,
[1655.12 → 1656.50] it kind of got to me
[1656.50 → 1656.90] a little bit
[1656.90 → 1658.00] because I can see
[1658.00 → 1659.80] saying it to a church.
[1664.64 → 1664.74] We,
[1665.20 → 1666.24] and Paul's saying that,
[1666.44 → 1668.24] we've got what it takes
[1668.24 → 1668.76] to win.
[1668.86 → 1669.30] What is that?
[1669.62 → 1671.36] Jesus' death on the cross
[1671.36 → 1672.18] and his resurrection,
[1672.54 → 1673.74] that's the winning formula.
[1673.74 → 1683.06] If we look at what we boast in,
[1684.64 → 1686.04] boasting reflects your identity.
[1687.40 → 1688.42] It's what you look to
[1688.42 → 1689.34] to achieve victory.
[1691.20 → 1692.48] Where does your confidence
[1692.48 → 1693.36] and strength come from?
[1693.42 → 1694.02] That's the question
[1694.02 → 1694.84] Paul's really asking.
[1695.04 → 1696.24] Where does your validation
[1696.24 → 1697.06] come from?
[1698.08 → 1699.88] Everyone boasts in something.
[1700.20 → 1701.34] I work so hard.
[1701.46 → 1702.08] Look at that.
[1702.28 → 1703.36] I'm a great dad.
[1703.36 → 1704.64] I'm smart.
[1704.78 → 1706.20] I have lots of money.
[1707.32 → 1708.68] And then we turn
[1708.68 → 1710.30] to whatever we boast in.
[1713.86 → 1715.04] And we find out
[1715.04 → 1715.76] pretty soon
[1715.76 → 1717.56] if what we were boasting in
[1717.56 → 1720.12] had substance to it
[1720.12 → 1721.24] and was life-giving
[1721.24 → 1722.44] or was false
[1722.44 → 1723.72] and leads to death.
[1723.72 → 1727.96] The modern self-esteem movement
[1727.96 → 1729.38] is in some ways
[1729.38 → 1730.10] all about boasting.
[1730.56 → 1732.20] You can do anything
[1732.20 → 1734.60] you put your mind to.
[1737.14 → 1738.62] I'm going to go real basic here.
[1739.00 → 1741.48] You can't save yourself.
[1744.90 → 1747.34] Your movement is missing the cross.
[1747.34 → 1754.90] In Philippians 3.3, Paul writes,
[1755.96 → 1757.90] For it is we who are
[1757.90 → 1759.16] the circumcision,
[1759.32 → 1760.30] in a sense the chosen,
[1760.76 → 1763.38] we who serve God by His Spirit,
[1763.80 → 1765.68] who boast in Christ Jesus
[1765.68 → 1768.00] and put no confidence in the flesh.
[1768.80 → 1770.46] No confidence.
[1770.46 → 1770.90] None.
[1774.24 → 1774.76] None.
[1776.98 → 1777.84] What does it mean
[1777.84 → 1778.78] to boast in the cross?
[1779.42 → 1780.70] It means you seek
[1780.70 → 1781.94] the approval of God
[1781.94 → 1783.16] and ultimately
[1783.16 → 1784.96] only Him.
[1788.06 → 1789.08] Because of Jesus,
[1789.60 → 1790.64] God sees you
[1790.64 → 1792.36] and He sees you and I
[1792.36 → 1794.36] as perfect in Christ
[1794.36 → 1795.44] the Son.
[1797.32 → 1798.14] Look at this quote
[1798.14 → 1799.28] from C.S. Lewis.
[1799.62 → 1800.42] Let me read it to you.
[1801.00 → 1801.88] Hopefully it comes up there.
[1804.14 → 1804.70] We read,
[1805.54 → 1807.22] How God thinks of us
[1807.22 → 1810.28] is not only more important
[1810.28 → 1812.08] but infinitely more important.
[1813.60 → 1813.92] Indeed,
[1814.06 → 1815.36] how we think of Him
[1815.36 → 1817.20] is of no importance
[1817.20 → 1818.66] except insofar
[1818.66 → 1819.88] as it's related
[1819.88 → 1821.22] to how He thinks of us.
[1821.90 → 1822.52] And then here we go.
[1823.64 → 1824.28] It is written
[1824.28 → 1825.82] that we shall stand
[1825.82 → 1827.16] before Him,
[1827.16 → 1828.36] shall appear,
[1828.52 → 1829.52] shall be inspected.
[1831.46 → 1833.26] The promise of glory
[1833.26 → 1834.08] is the promise
[1834.08 → 1835.14] almost incredible
[1835.14 → 1836.34] and only possible
[1836.34 → 1837.90] by the work of Christ.
[1838.26 → 1839.26] That some of us,
[1839.34 → 1840.46] that any of us
[1840.46 → 1841.64] who really chooses
[1841.64 → 1843.44] shall actually survive
[1843.44 → 1844.30] the examination,
[1844.72 → 1845.64] shall find approval,
[1845.96 → 1846.86] shall please God.
[1847.06 → 1848.12] To please God,
[1848.38 → 1850.62] to be a real ingredient
[1850.62 → 1852.16] of divine happiness.
[1852.16 → 1852.72] happiness.
[1854.42 → 1855.84] To be loved by God,
[1856.16 → 1857.28] not merely pitied,
[1857.52 → 1858.46] but delighted in
[1858.46 → 1859.56] as an artist delights
[1859.56 → 1860.20] in his work
[1860.20 → 1861.42] or a father and a son.
[1861.58 → 1862.84] It seems impossible.
[1863.22 → 1864.38] A weight or burden
[1864.38 → 1864.92] of glory
[1864.92 → 1865.92] which our thoughts
[1865.92 → 1866.90] can hardly sustain.
[1867.30 → 1868.50] But so it is.
[1871.50 → 1872.38] Do you see
[1872.38 → 1874.32] you standing before God
[1874.32 → 1877.76] and God is just delighted?
[1881.02 → 1882.10] He's just delighted.
[1884.34 → 1885.42] That's what Paul's saying.
[1886.60 → 1887.98] When we look at the cross,
[1888.04 → 1888.54] yeah, we see
[1888.54 → 1889.82] the horrible instrument
[1889.82 → 1890.40] of torture,
[1890.68 → 1891.52] but we also see
[1891.52 → 1892.96] the pathway to victory
[1892.96 → 1894.66] because Christ overcame
[1894.66 → 1895.60] all that was awful,
[1896.24 → 1897.16] including the cross.
[1897.16 → 1900.54] All your life,
[1901.16 → 1901.84] in my life,
[1901.96 → 1903.06] we've knocked on the door
[1903.06 → 1903.82] of affirmation.
[1904.18 → 1905.08] Tell me I'm okay.
[1905.50 → 1906.52] Tell me I'm loved.
[1908.44 → 1909.04] Tell me.
[1909.34 → 1911.02] And you try to get it elsewhere
[1911.02 → 1912.48] if you don't go
[1912.48 → 1913.04] to the right place.
[1913.18 → 1913.94] And you try to get it
[1913.94 → 1914.90] from the people around you.
[1915.02 → 1916.22] And you kind of use them
[1916.22 → 1917.44] to prop yourself up.
[1917.64 → 1919.00] And it doesn't work out
[1919.00 → 1919.68] very well.
[1921.86 → 1922.52] And Scripture says
[1922.52 → 1923.52] Jesus is the door.
[1923.62 → 1924.14] He is the way,
[1924.20 → 1924.76] the truth, and the life.
[1924.76 → 1926.36] He paid the price for you
[1926.36 → 1928.06] so that you could hear
[1928.06 → 1928.70] from God
[1928.70 → 1930.18] when you come before Him.
[1930.40 → 1931.18] Well done,
[1931.34 → 1932.24] good and faithful servant.
[1932.54 → 1933.38] Well done.
[1934.82 → 1936.52] I'm delighted with you.
[1939.70 → 1940.78] And out of that,
[1940.88 → 1941.92] then we go humbly
[1941.92 → 1943.44] in the power of the Spirit.
[1943.72 → 1944.42] We go humbly,
[1944.52 → 1945.20] yet boldly,
[1945.28 → 1946.40] to boast of the cross
[1946.40 → 1947.68] and to bring the good news
[1947.68 → 1948.22] of the kingdom
[1948.22 → 1949.14] to those around us.
[1949.96 → 1950.84] Seeing them
[1950.84 → 1952.80] in the love of Christ
[1952.80 → 1954.14] that He has for us.
[1955.22 → 1956.20] May that be
[1956.20 → 1957.74] beaten into your head
[1957.74 → 1959.28] and into your heart
[1959.28 → 1960.62] every day,
[1960.74 → 1961.62] all the time,
[1961.78 → 1962.72] for the rest of your lives.
[1964.30 → 1964.90] Let's pray.
[1969.10 → 1970.08] Lord God Almighty,
[1970.46 → 1973.80] thank You for loving us
[1973.80 → 1974.24] so much.
[1977.50 → 1978.62] Thank You for the cross.
[1978.98 → 1979.54] Thank You that
[1979.54 → 1983.60] You bought life for us.
[1983.60 → 1985.84] and that You give us
[1985.84 → 1986.36] Your Spirit
[1986.36 → 1987.18] and then we can
[1987.18 → 1989.14] live out of the fruits
[1989.14 → 1989.60] of the Spirit.
[1989.70 → 1990.46] We can be patient
[1990.46 → 1990.96] and kind
[1990.96 → 1991.44] and loving
[1991.44 → 1992.78] and faithful
[1992.78 → 1995.10] and have forbearance
[1995.10 → 1996.92] and on and on it goes.
[1997.34 → 1998.12] Thank You for that.
[1999.28 → 1999.80] And thank You,
[1999.90 → 2000.32] Lord Jesus,
[2000.82 → 2002.72] that You are our Saviour
[2002.72 → 2004.36] and that You continually
[2004.36 → 2005.04] save us
[2005.04 → 2005.96] and transform us
[2005.96 → 2006.70] and restore us.
[2006.86 → 2007.62] And You restore us
[2007.62 → 2008.34] ever so gently,
[2008.46 → 2009.14] even if it doesn't
[2009.14 → 2009.96] always feel gentle.
[2009.96 → 2012.02] Lord,
[2012.24 → 2013.16] may we continually
[2013.16 → 2014.30] surrender to You
[2014.30 → 2015.82] and to Your ways.
[2016.92 → 2017.86] May we be cleansed
[2017.86 → 2018.74] of our unrighteousness
[2018.74 → 2019.32] knowing then
[2019.32 → 2020.02] that we are utterly
[2020.02 → 2021.24] cleansed because of Jesus.
[2022.12 → 2023.20] And then go forth
[2023.20 → 2024.54] with great confidence
[2024.54 → 2025.46] in You
[2025.46 → 2026.88] and boast in You alone
[2026.88 → 2027.60] in Jesus' name.
[2028.00 → 2028.22] Amen.
[2028.22 → 2028.34] Amen.
[2028.34 → 2051.50] How deep the Father's
[2051.50 → 2054.58] love for us
[2054.58 → 2059.46] How vast beyond all measure
[2059.46 → 2065.58] That He should give His only Son
[2065.58 → 2070.56] To make a wretch His treasure
[2070.56 → 2074.56] How great the pain
[2074.56 → 2077.44] of searing loss
[2077.44 → 2080.34] The Father's debt
[2080.34 → 2083.04] His face away
[2083.04 → 2086.18] As wounds switched by
[2086.18 → 2088.80] the Chosen One
[2088.80 → 2093.88] Bring many souls to glory
[2093.88 → 2107.16] Behold the man
[2107.16 → 2110.08] I have lost
[2110.08 → 2115.22] My sin upon His shoulders
[2115.22 → 2118.84] And the chains I hear
[2118.84 → 2121.66] My God in voice
[2121.66 → 2123.80] Come out
[2123.80 → 2127.58] Upon the strong feet
[2127.58 → 2130.44] It was my sin
[2130.44 → 2133.24] That held Him bare
[2133.24 → 2138.22] Until it was accomplished
[2138.22 → 2142.02] His dying breath
[2142.02 → 2144.68] Has long to be done
[2144.68 → 2149.72] I know that it is finished
[2149.72 → 2164.64] I will not boast in anything
[2164.64 → 2167.32] No gifts
[2167.32 → 2168.48] No power
[2168.48 → 2169.64] No innocence
[2169.64 → 2176.64] But I will boast in Jesus Christ
[2176.64 → 2178.78] His death
[2178.78 → 2181.82] And resurrection
[2181.82 → 2185.72] Why should I bleed
[2185.72 → 2187.64] From His reward
[2187.64 → 2193.50] I cannot give an answer
[2193.50 → 2196.94] But this I know
[2196.94 → 2199.64] With all my heart
[2199.64 → 2204.64] His wounds have made my ransom
[2204.64 → 2210.56] Why should I gain from His reward
[2210.56 → 2215.64] I cannot give an answer
[2215.64 → 2219.78] But this I know
[2219.78 → 2222.36] With all my heart
[2222.36 → 2227.64] His wounds have made my ransom
[2227.64 → 2246.10] Before I give you the parting blessing
[2246.10 → 2247.28] A reminder
[2247.28 → 2250.80] For the newbies
[2250.80 → 2253.32] Newish people
[2253.32 → 2254.52] There's soup
[2254.52 → 2255.06] There's soup and buns
[2255.06 → 2256.24] And we're going to do
[2256.24 → 2258.10] Sharing about what the church is about
[2258.10 → 2259.82] And some of the staff
[2259.82 → 2260.90] And so forth and so on
[2260.90 → 2262.06] So we'd love you to stay
[2262.06 → 2263.52] We don't want that soup to go to waste
[2263.52 → 2264.98] So come on out
[2264.98 → 2265.68] And enjoy some
[2265.68 → 2267.18] We're going to be in the fireside room over there
[2267.18 → 2269.18] The fireside room that has no fire
[2269.18 → 2270.32] But it has soup
[2270.32 → 2271.14] So that's good
[2271.14 → 2274.42] You're welcome to come and stay with us
[2274.42 → 2275.36] And we'd love to see you
[2275.36 → 2280.46] Let me give you God's blessing
[2280.46 → 2283.54] Come Lord Jesus
[2283.54 → 2285.62] And startle me
[2285.62 → 2287.02] With your presence
[2287.02 → 2288.76] Life sustaining as air
[2288.76 → 2291.30] To open my heart
[2291.30 → 2292.36] To praise you
[2292.36 → 2293.34] To open my mind
[2293.34 → 2294.46] To attend to you
[2294.46 → 2295.64] To open my spirit
[2295.64 → 2296.74] To worship you
[2296.74 → 2297.76] To open me
[2297.76 → 2298.96] To live my life
[2298.96 → 2300.00] As authentically
[2300.00 → 2300.68] And boldly
[2300.68 → 2302.08] As you lived yours
[2302.08 → 2304.04] Come Lord Jesus
[2304.04 → 2304.98] Be with me
[2304.98 → 2306.18] In my longing
[2306.18 → 2307.46] Come stay with me
[2307.46 → 2308.20] In my needing
[2308.20 → 2309.52] Come go with me
[2309.52 → 2310.20] In my doing
[2310.20 → 2311.42] Come struggle with me
[2311.42 → 2312.26] In my searching
[2312.26 → 2313.94] Come rejoice with me
[2313.94 → 2315.72] In my loving
[2315.72 → 2318.82] People of God
[2318.82 → 2320.74] Go in his name
[2320.74 → 2323.64] Show who Jesus is
[2323.64 → 2325.58] By the way you live
[2325.58 → 2328.66] Let him fill your heart
[2328.66 → 2331.04] And continually save you
[2331.04 → 2331.88] Amen
[2331.88 → 2334.74] Sing one final song together
[2334.74 → 2338.54] Come set your rule and rein
[2338.54 → 2338.62] Come set your rule and write
[2338.62 → 2340.62] jail for your ISI
[2340.62 → 2341.18] From God to sliver
