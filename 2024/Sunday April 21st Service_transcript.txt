[0.00 --> 9.82]  Good morning, Hope.
[11.82 --> 15.24]  This morning we are continuing with our series on forgiveness.
[16.08 --> 20.66]  And I actually want to highlight the subtitle for our series as we begin this morning.
[21.12 --> 24.52]  As you can see, if you can see in the graphic there with the pictures,
[25.34 --> 29.82]  forgiveness, and the subtitle is Learning to Live in Grace.
[30.28 --> 31.46]  With grace.
[32.16 --> 34.52]  And that's what we want to focus in on today.
[35.10 --> 40.76]  We have now reflected for the last couple of weeks on what it means to forgive as we have been forgiven.
[41.64 --> 46.20]  This is our Christian identity, a way of life to live in grace.
[46.72 --> 52.84]  And if you haven't been able to listen to our past sermons here for the last couple of weeks on forgiveness,
[53.38 --> 57.50]  I strongly encourage you, whether you can go onto our YouTube site,
[57.50 --> 59.90]  or you can listen to us on podcast.
[60.40 --> 62.48]  We do have a podcast, by the way.
[62.90 --> 66.80]  And so I'm not just promoting it because I edit it and I'm in charge of it or anything.
[67.66 --> 70.38]  I just, I'm not big on the numbers thing.
[70.44 --> 71.46]  I don't need more followers.
[71.92 --> 73.80]  It's just the way, if you miss a sermon,
[73.90 --> 77.70]  it's a great way to listen to it on your drive to work or wherever you can listen.
[78.24 --> 80.14]  Listen to the past sermons on forgiveness.
[80.14 --> 85.10]  And today is a continuation of, obviously, our sermon series.
[85.80 --> 91.52]  We continue with this difficult and sometimes seemingly impossible identity of ours.
[92.04 --> 98.58]  This living out, this lifestyle of forgiving because we have been forgiven.
[98.58 --> 108.84]  And today we hear from Jesus who teaches us specifically on how to handle conflicts among brothers and sisters in His church, His body.
[109.60 --> 111.12]  This is a word for us, church.
[111.48 --> 116.20]  And so if you have your Bible with you, or if you can follow along on the screen,
[116.38 --> 120.84]  we are in Matthew chapter 18 this morning and also Galatians chapter 6.
[120.84 --> 126.98]  So we'll start with Matthew 18, verse 15, where Jesus tells us,
[127.52 --> 134.14]  If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault just between the two of you.
[134.78 --> 137.90]  If they listen to you, you have won them over.
[138.42 --> 146.38]  But if they will not listen, take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
[146.38 --> 150.96]  If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church.
[151.66 --> 156.82]  And if they refuse to listen to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
[157.80 --> 160.98]  Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven,
[161.18 --> 163.98]  and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
[164.62 --> 169.54]  And again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for,
[169.86 --> 172.42]  it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
[172.42 --> 177.86]  Because where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.
[178.64 --> 181.14]  And from Galatians, Paul says to the church,
[181.56 --> 184.14]  Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin,
[184.68 --> 188.90]  you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently.
[189.88 --> 193.68]  But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted.
[194.50 --> 195.90]  Carry each other's burdens.
[195.90 --> 199.54]  And in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ.
[200.40 --> 200.90]  Amen.
[200.90 --> 206.64]  Personally, as we've been learning and reflecting from this sermon series,
[206.74 --> 208.00]  and thinking about forgiveness,
[208.46 --> 211.70]  there is one thing that I really, really resonate with.
[212.36 --> 214.22]  And it is the fact that forgiveness,
[214.76 --> 217.16]  and seeking reconciliation that comes with it,
[217.44 --> 219.48]  is extremely difficult.
[220.54 --> 222.44]  It is very, very difficult.
[222.80 --> 223.94]  And what I want to say is,
[223.94 --> 228.02]  it is much harder to forgive and seek true reconciliation,
[228.82 --> 230.82]  compared to just forgetting about it,
[231.16 --> 233.26]  or just holding a grudge inside of you,
[233.60 --> 236.34]  or worse, finding different ways to cope,
[236.66 --> 237.74]  such as gossiping,
[238.06 --> 240.68]  or holding hatred inside of your heart.
[242.30 --> 245.08]  Specifically from Jesus' teaching from our passage this morning,
[245.40 --> 248.54]  it reminded me actually of my upbringing in my dad's church,
[248.54 --> 251.50]  a smaller church that I grew up in.
[252.00 --> 255.50]  Our church was small enough where everyone practically knew everyone.
[255.80 --> 257.52]  That's sort of the dynamic that we had.
[257.88 --> 260.94]  And one of the gifts from being a smaller church is that
[260.94 --> 263.20]  whenever sins are committed,
[263.58 --> 264.80]  and we'll talk about that today,
[264.84 --> 265.98]  we'll expand on that,
[266.38 --> 268.74]  but when some things go wrong,
[268.74 --> 269.82]  and when there's conflict,
[270.30 --> 273.62]  you usually don't have the option of avoiding it,
[273.92 --> 275.12]  and pretending it didn't happen,
[275.22 --> 276.24]  or you brush it off,
[276.52 --> 277.90]  oh, I'm not part of that circle.
[278.50 --> 279.80]  Well, there's only one circle.
[280.20 --> 281.34]  Everyone knows everyone,
[281.70 --> 283.64]  and everyone will probably know
[283.64 --> 286.14]  about the conflict or the wrongdoing
[286.14 --> 287.40]  that was done by somebody.
[288.04 --> 289.24]  And so with that in mind,
[289.72 --> 291.48]  that was especially annoying for me.
[291.96 --> 292.20]  Why?
[292.60 --> 293.74]  Because I was the PK.
[294.54 --> 295.50]  Eyes are on you.
[296.10 --> 298.30]  And that meant I could not sin easily.
[298.74 --> 299.90]  I had to be creative.
[301.04 --> 305.00]  So growing up in one of these creative seasons of my life
[305.00 --> 306.12]  in high school, okay,
[306.16 --> 307.94]  it wasn't when I was super mature,
[308.84 --> 309.46]  I acted,
[309.58 --> 311.92]  so I was struggling with my Christian identity growing up,
[311.96 --> 312.90]  especially being a PK.
[313.30 --> 314.06]  PKs are weird.
[314.36 --> 315.88]  Just, no offense, sorry Levi,
[316.08 --> 316.56]  but I'm,
[317.26 --> 318.98]  that's just the dynamic of being a PK.
[319.60 --> 323.00]  And as I wrestled with my sort of struggle,
[323.48 --> 324.68]  I did things,
[324.68 --> 326.22]  I acted in certain ways,
[326.32 --> 327.54]  I said certain things
[327.54 --> 329.50]  that I was very not much proud of,
[329.54 --> 330.04]  even then.
[331.08 --> 332.24]  And when word got out,
[332.32 --> 333.30]  and word gets out,
[333.44 --> 335.14]  especially again in a small community,
[335.70 --> 337.04]  of my misbehaviors,
[337.32 --> 339.54]  one of the older youth confronted me,
[339.98 --> 341.82]  which is sort of what Jesus teaches us today.
[342.44 --> 343.42]  He confronted me,
[343.50 --> 345.34]  but with gentleness and care,
[345.50 --> 347.58]  also from Galatians passage.
[348.04 --> 349.52]  That's the important part, by the way.
[350.04 --> 351.18]  There are three steps here.
[351.66 --> 352.68]  You confront sin.
[352.68 --> 354.88]  You do not let sin just slide by
[354.88 --> 356.94]  and continue on as a pattern of life.
[357.44 --> 359.96]  But you do it with care and gentleness,
[360.08 --> 361.04]  as Paul teaches us.
[361.36 --> 362.24]  And the last part,
[362.96 --> 363.58]  the goal,
[363.84 --> 364.78]  the ultimate goal,
[364.94 --> 365.62]  is reconciliation.
[366.32 --> 367.76]  Whether that's achieved or not,
[368.16 --> 369.52]  that's the direction we're heading.
[370.06 --> 371.90]  We head toward reconciliation.
[372.40 --> 372.94]  And so anyways,
[373.04 --> 373.78]  with that in mind,
[374.04 --> 375.48]  this older youth confronted me,
[375.84 --> 378.72]  and he was so Christ-like in that situation.
[379.40 --> 381.86]  I don't think he realized how Christ-like he was.
[382.12 --> 384.22]  I didn't realize how Christ-like he was.
[384.60 --> 384.94]  Why?
[385.14 --> 385.84]  In the sense,
[385.94 --> 387.94]  because just as Jesus teaches us today
[387.94 --> 388.76]  from Matthew 18,
[388.76 --> 391.00]  he confronted me privately.
[391.68 --> 392.74]  He pulled me aside
[392.74 --> 394.04]  during one of Sunday services,
[394.50 --> 395.70]  and he confronted me
[395.70 --> 397.12]  and forced me in a way
[397.12 --> 399.08]  to reflect on how serious
[399.08 --> 400.54]  and how destructive
[400.54 --> 401.78]  my patterns,
[401.90 --> 402.88]  my misbehaviors,
[403.08 --> 403.80]  could be,
[403.90 --> 404.52]  and is,
[404.70 --> 405.40]  at that point.
[406.96 --> 408.48]  He was not a saint, though.
[409.50 --> 410.88]  That's an important part as well.
[411.42 --> 412.84]  He did not confront me
[412.84 --> 415.04]  from a place of self-righteousness and pride.
[415.42 --> 417.04]  He did not have his life altogether.
[417.14 --> 418.26]  I can tell you that for sure.
[418.74 --> 419.86]  But he came to me
[419.86 --> 422.30]  in a posture of care and gentleness,
[423.28 --> 425.18]  wanting real growth from me.
[426.64 --> 427.82]  Now that's the important part.
[428.28 --> 429.14]  Another important part
[429.14 --> 429.80]  that I want to highlight
[429.80 --> 430.78]  before we move on
[430.78 --> 431.72]  is,
[432.12 --> 433.26]  yes, he confronted me.
[433.68 --> 435.06]  I accepted it humbly.
[435.56 --> 435.82]  It was,
[436.28 --> 437.88]  I was not proud of my actions.
[437.88 --> 438.50]  But,
[438.86 --> 440.10]  it wasn't one and done.
[440.86 --> 441.40]  It wasn't,
[441.52 --> 441.76]  alright,
[442.22 --> 442.94]  some guy
[442.94 --> 444.26]  cared about me
[444.26 --> 444.94]  within the church,
[445.20 --> 446.16]  so now overnight,
[446.34 --> 447.48]  I no longer sin.
[448.14 --> 449.20]  I no longer struggle
[449.20 --> 449.78]  with that sin.
[450.12 --> 451.12]  It wasn't like that.
[451.58 --> 453.32]  It's an ongoing process.
[453.76 --> 455.22]  It's not a one and done deal,
[455.30 --> 456.58]  as Pastor Sid mentioned before.
[457.06 --> 457.88]  It is a,
[458.24 --> 459.56]  it is the hard work.
[459.78 --> 461.28]  It is a long process.
[461.68 --> 462.40]  Really long
[462.40 --> 463.38]  in certain situations.
[463.38 --> 464.42]  But,
[464.42 --> 466.12]  that confrontation,
[466.78 --> 467.60]  that calling out
[467.60 --> 468.66]  of my misbehaviors,
[468.86 --> 470.98]  was a significant impact
[470.98 --> 472.28]  into my growth,
[472.70 --> 474.80]  even as I go through growth today.
[475.26 --> 475.64]  Hopefully,
[475.84 --> 477.10]  more and more like my Savior.
[477.82 --> 478.08]  It,
[478.08 --> 478.84]  it played
[478.84 --> 480.46]  a significant role
[480.46 --> 481.04]  in my life.
[481.90 --> 482.32]  Again,
[482.70 --> 483.28]  hard work,
[483.66 --> 484.50]  this living out
[484.50 --> 485.28]  of our identity
[485.28 --> 486.02]  of forgiveness
[486.02 --> 486.80]  and reconciliation.
[486.80 --> 488.58]  And I want to suggest
[488.58 --> 490.26]  from Jesus and Paul's teaching
[490.26 --> 490.78]  this morning,
[491.32 --> 493.02]  that it is our Christian duty.
[493.78 --> 494.92]  It is our mission,
[495.08 --> 495.72]  our identity,
[496.26 --> 497.76]  to fulfill the law of Christ
[497.76 --> 499.32]  and carry each other's burdens,
[499.54 --> 500.72]  as Paul says in Galatians.
[501.06 --> 502.82]  To confront sin.
[504.22 --> 505.22]  We don't let that go.
[505.98 --> 507.58]  But seek reconciliation
[507.58 --> 509.22]  with gentleness and love.
[509.46 --> 510.34]  And in this way,
[510.52 --> 511.50]  we get to embody
[511.50 --> 512.70]  and reflect
[512.70 --> 513.70]  the forgiving,
[514.10 --> 514.90]  loving goodness
[514.90 --> 516.00]  of our God,
[516.00 --> 517.64]  so that we may be
[517.64 --> 519.10]  witnesses for the world.
[519.46 --> 520.20]  A glimpse,
[520.40 --> 521.82]  maybe just a small glimpse,
[522.00 --> 522.68]  but a glimpse
[522.68 --> 525.36]  of what being real humans
[525.36 --> 526.32]  looks like.
[526.98 --> 528.90]  A community of real people,
[529.98 --> 531.44]  real broken human beings
[531.44 --> 532.34]  that come together,
[532.46 --> 533.14]  try to reflect
[533.14 --> 534.10]  the goodness of God
[534.10 --> 535.62]  because we're all forgiven.
[536.22 --> 537.44]  And we try to seek
[537.44 --> 538.80]  reconciliation together.
[539.68 --> 540.44]  And that's the key,
[540.58 --> 540.90]  isn't it?
[541.36 --> 542.44]  We're seeking
[542.44 --> 543.88]  reconciliation together.
[544.50 --> 545.12]  The Bible
[545.12 --> 545.92]  and Jesus
[545.92 --> 546.34]  and Paul,
[546.44 --> 547.02]  whoever it is,
[547.08 --> 547.78]  they're not naive.
[548.02 --> 549.10]  They don't simply say,
[549.28 --> 549.58]  all right,
[549.76 --> 551.04]  you enter the church doors,
[551.32 --> 551.92]  you're forgiven,
[552.04 --> 552.90]  you know your identity,
[553.28 --> 554.42]  all problem solved,
[554.52 --> 555.62]  you don't need reconciliation.
[556.30 --> 557.66]  Everyone is just perfect.
[559.14 --> 559.42]  No.
[559.76 --> 560.68]  They know
[560.68 --> 561.90]  that we are broken.
[562.50 --> 562.72]  They,
[563.32 --> 563.58]  they,
[563.72 --> 564.00]  I mean,
[564.18 --> 564.98]  Jesus and Paul,
[565.44 --> 566.18]  they know
[566.18 --> 568.32]  that we are broken
[568.32 --> 569.76]  and we need guidance
[569.76 --> 570.22]  and help
[570.22 --> 571.20]  every step of the way.
[573.14 --> 574.96]  We seek reconciliation
[574.96 --> 576.24]  through the power
[576.24 --> 577.02]  of forgiveness
[577.02 --> 579.38]  because we are a people
[579.38 --> 580.50]  who have been saved
[580.50 --> 581.56]  by that same power.
[582.06 --> 583.00]  We'll talk about it more.
[583.22 --> 584.36]  That's the starting place.
[585.12 --> 586.32]  That's the starting place.
[586.88 --> 588.28]  We experienced
[588.28 --> 590.28]  the power of forgiveness.
[590.28 --> 592.56]  So with this in mind,
[592.74 --> 593.60]  with that goal,
[593.76 --> 594.98]  with gentleness and care,
[595.54 --> 596.48]  it is significant
[596.48 --> 597.16]  to define
[597.16 --> 598.36]  what Jesus and Paul meant
[598.36 --> 599.56]  when they mention
[599.56 --> 600.72]  a brother or sister
[600.72 --> 601.34]  who sins,
[601.72 --> 602.34]  or you can say
[602.34 --> 603.84]  who is caught in a sin.
[604.64 --> 605.22]  And here,
[605.38 --> 606.16]  we're not talking
[606.16 --> 606.88]  simply about
[606.88 --> 608.12]  some one-off mistakes
[608.12 --> 609.94]  or some unintended actions
[609.94 --> 611.20]  that may have been hurtful.
[611.96 --> 613.28]  We are talking about
[613.28 --> 614.04]  a deliberate
[614.04 --> 615.84]  pattern of life
[615.84 --> 617.28]  that hinders the growth
[617.28 --> 618.24]  and the flourishing
[618.24 --> 619.58]  of the body of Christ,
[619.68 --> 620.22]  the church.
[621.54 --> 622.40]  So this is what
[622.40 --> 623.12]  they're talking about
[623.12 --> 624.68]  when they talk about sin.
[625.26 --> 626.24]  It's a pattern of life.
[626.58 --> 627.16]  And Val today,
[627.24 --> 627.66]  this morning,
[627.76 --> 629.08]  opened up with Psalm 1,
[629.16 --> 630.92]  which was very appropriate
[630.92 --> 632.60]  because Psalm 1 says,
[632.88 --> 633.48]  Blessed are the people
[633.48 --> 635.20]  who do not walk
[635.20 --> 636.36]  in step with the wicked
[636.36 --> 637.96]  or stand or sit.
[638.20 --> 639.70]  This is a pattern of life.
[639.96 --> 640.28]  Again,
[640.40 --> 641.76]  not a one-and-done thing
[641.76 --> 642.98]  in the pattern of sin either.
[643.38 --> 644.98]  Not just unintended mistakes
[644.98 --> 646.02]  that hurt somebody's feelings.
[646.30 --> 647.26]  There is a place for that.
[647.28 --> 648.74]  But when we talk
[648.74 --> 649.62]  about sin here,
[649.92 --> 650.70]  a brother or sister
[650.70 --> 652.16]  who is caught in a sin,
[652.22 --> 653.10]  a pattern of life,
[653.90 --> 655.96]  that's when we are given
[655.96 --> 657.72]  the duty to carefully,
[658.34 --> 660.14]  with care and gentleness,
[660.38 --> 661.34]  confront the sin.
[661.90 --> 663.62]  We do not want to brush it off
[663.62 --> 664.26]  and let it go.
[665.08 --> 666.34]  That's the easy thing to do.
[666.64 --> 667.34]  But that's not what
[667.34 --> 668.24]  we're called to do.
[669.58 --> 671.04]  So the Greek verb
[671.04 --> 671.88]  that is used here,
[671.98 --> 672.44]  translated,
[672.82 --> 673.22]  point out,
[673.28 --> 673.82]  in our NIV,
[673.96 --> 674.28]  it says,
[674.68 --> 675.92]  go and point out
[675.92 --> 676.76]  to your brother's
[676.76 --> 678.16]  brother or sister's sin.
[679.36 --> 680.88]  Or in different translation,
[681.06 --> 681.68]  it says confront.
[682.00 --> 683.08]  The Greek word here
[683.08 --> 683.80]  is alecho.
[684.20 --> 685.28]  And it actually means
[685.28 --> 686.08]  to confront,
[686.42 --> 686.68]  yes,
[687.02 --> 687.78]  to convict.
[688.04 --> 688.86]  It also means
[688.86 --> 689.76]  to expose.
[690.76 --> 691.80]  It also means
[691.80 --> 692.56]  to reprove.
[693.18 --> 693.62]  You're heading
[693.62 --> 694.82]  toward repentance.
[695.46 --> 696.54]  That's the point.
[697.04 --> 697.66]  And also,
[697.88 --> 699.28]  the important part is,
[699.40 --> 700.60]  what does Jesus start with?
[701.24 --> 701.82]  He says,
[702.04 --> 702.24]  go.
[703.28 --> 704.70]  This is a command.
[705.24 --> 706.70]  This is not just some,
[706.70 --> 708.92]  some practice
[708.92 --> 709.48]  that we can do
[709.48 --> 710.66]  that might be good for us.
[710.76 --> 711.62]  This is a command.
[711.82 --> 712.54]  This is a part
[712.54 --> 713.32]  of the core
[713.32 --> 714.04]  of our identity.
[714.66 --> 715.24]  Jesus says,
[715.44 --> 716.88]  go and confront,
[717.06 --> 717.66]  point out,
[718.00 --> 718.52]  expose,
[719.06 --> 720.08]  with gentleness
[720.08 --> 720.58]  and care,
[720.84 --> 722.16]  with the end goal
[722.16 --> 722.96]  of reconciliation.
[724.10 --> 725.50]  So this is our command.
[726.68 --> 727.38]  And here,
[727.50 --> 728.62]  Jesus is not inventing
[728.62 --> 729.56]  a new Christian concept,
[729.62 --> 729.96]  by the way.
[730.54 --> 731.18]  It's not like
[731.18 --> 732.04]  Jesus came on earth
[732.04 --> 732.46]  and it's like,
[732.86 --> 733.04]  hey,
[733.48 --> 734.10]  I think I know
[734.10 --> 734.48]  what it means
[734.48 --> 735.18]  to be really human
[735.18 --> 735.90]  and to flourish.
[736.08 --> 736.96]  So let me teach you.
[737.74 --> 738.68]  Jesus is simply
[738.68 --> 740.10]  continuing the whole
[740.10 --> 741.02]  story of the Bible
[741.02 --> 742.52]  where God's people
[742.52 --> 744.30]  were always called
[744.30 --> 745.54]  to be a people
[745.54 --> 746.50]  of forgiveness
[746.50 --> 747.64]  and reconciliation,
[748.44 --> 749.56]  a people of shalom,
[749.82 --> 750.18]  harmony,
[750.60 --> 750.96]  together.
[752.52 --> 752.90]  Jesus,
[753.16 --> 753.94]  so obviously,
[754.50 --> 756.98]  quotes Deuteronomy 19
[756.98 --> 758.10]  when he says,
[758.10 --> 759.26]  call two or three witnesses,
[759.46 --> 759.96]  that part.
[760.40 --> 761.02]  But also,
[761.16 --> 762.18]  this idea reflects
[762.18 --> 762.88]  the Old Testament
[762.88 --> 764.08]  from two verses
[764.08 --> 764.78]  I pulled out.
[764.98 --> 765.88]  I love this proverb.
[766.26 --> 766.76]  Every culture
[766.76 --> 767.80]  has wisdom sayings,
[768.04 --> 768.76]  but this one comes
[768.76 --> 769.36]  from our Bible.
[770.04 --> 771.38]  Proverbs 27 says,
[771.94 --> 773.66]  better an open rebuke
[773.66 --> 775.48]  than love that is concealed.
[776.24 --> 776.88]  The wounds,
[777.00 --> 778.16]  so the open rebuke,
[778.32 --> 779.06]  from a friend
[779.06 --> 779.80]  are faithful.
[780.28 --> 780.92]  Or in other words,
[780.98 --> 781.78]  they can be trusted,
[782.30 --> 783.54]  but the kisses
[783.54 --> 784.62]  of an enemy
[784.62 --> 785.42]  are deceitful.
[786.40 --> 787.84]  That's such a wise saying.
[788.10 --> 791.34]  Leviticus 19 also,
[791.56 --> 792.16]  part of the law.
[793.06 --> 794.80]  You must not harbor hatred
[794.80 --> 795.60]  against your brother
[795.60 --> 796.28]  in your heart.
[797.16 --> 798.82]  Directly or openly
[798.82 --> 800.10]  rebuke your neighbor
[800.10 --> 801.12]  so that you will not
[801.12 --> 802.00]  incur guilt
[802.00 --> 803.02]  on account of him.
[803.56 --> 804.46]  Do you notice
[804.46 --> 805.16]  the duty here?
[805.42 --> 806.86]  It is your mandate.
[807.26 --> 808.44]  You have the responsibility
[808.44 --> 809.80]  to expose
[809.80 --> 811.98]  and confront the sin
[811.98 --> 814.52]  because you might
[814.52 --> 815.36]  incur guilt
[815.36 --> 816.12]  on account
[816.12 --> 817.02]  of not
[817.02 --> 818.28]  or looking the other way
[818.28 --> 819.64]  and letting that sin slide.
[820.94 --> 822.62]  Do not seek revenge
[822.62 --> 823.72]  or bear a grudge
[823.72 --> 824.98]  against any of your people,
[825.14 --> 826.48]  but love your neighbor
[826.48 --> 827.40]  as yourself.
[827.62 --> 828.54]  I am the Lord.
[828.54 --> 830.48]  See,
[830.56 --> 831.62]  this ultimate command
[831.62 --> 832.64]  to love God
[832.64 --> 833.44]  and love neighbor
[833.44 --> 834.50]  as Jesus teaches us
[834.50 --> 835.28]  from the Old Testament,
[835.88 --> 836.98]  this includes
[836.98 --> 838.02]  the difficult journey
[838.02 --> 839.20]  of seeking reconciliation.
[840.34 --> 841.72]  It is a difficult,
[841.92 --> 843.92]  it is a very hard task
[843.92 --> 844.34]  to do,
[844.62 --> 845.86]  but we are called
[845.86 --> 847.14]  to reflect that identity
[847.14 --> 847.68]  of ours.
[848.18 --> 848.92]  And so the question
[848.92 --> 849.82]  we should be asking
[849.82 --> 850.90]  one another is this,
[851.46 --> 852.96]  do you care enough,
[852.96 --> 855.16]  do you care enough of me
[855.16 --> 856.04]  to tell me
[856.04 --> 856.76]  when I'm sinning?
[857.68 --> 859.06]  And then on the other side
[859.06 --> 859.48]  of that,
[860.40 --> 860.90]  are you,
[861.02 --> 861.78]  when you receive
[861.78 --> 862.54]  that reproval
[862.54 --> 863.24]  or discipline,
[863.72 --> 864.76]  are you humble enough
[864.76 --> 865.80]  to accept that
[865.80 --> 866.96]  as care,
[867.44 --> 868.60]  as wanting growth
[868.60 --> 869.00]  out of you
[869.00 --> 870.20]  instead of receiving it
[870.20 --> 871.02]  as an attack?
[871.92 --> 873.10]  It is a two-way street,
[873.20 --> 873.80]  this reconciliation.
[874.60 --> 875.98]  It is not just one person.
[876.54 --> 877.44]  It is two parties
[877.44 --> 878.20]  coming together,
[878.68 --> 879.36]  receiving it
[879.36 --> 880.06]  with gentleness
[880.06 --> 881.24]  and care and growth,
[881.66 --> 882.64]  seeking reconciliation.
[883.72 --> 884.94]  This is not easy,
[885.06 --> 885.44]  obviously,
[885.72 --> 887.20]  and this has been abused
[887.20 --> 888.54]  by the church in the past,
[888.68 --> 889.72]  where we just simply
[889.72 --> 890.40]  point fingers.
[890.50 --> 891.76]  That's also easy to do.
[893.78 --> 895.46]  But we seek reconciliation
[895.46 --> 896.88]  together in humility
[896.88 --> 897.64]  and care
[897.64 --> 900.24]  because the starting place,
[900.94 --> 902.08]  the starting place,
[902.46 --> 905.02]  is that we are all sinners,
[905.16 --> 905.52]  aren't we?
[906.24 --> 907.64]  We are a gathering
[907.64 --> 908.90]  of not just saints.
[909.42 --> 910.18]  That's the identity
[910.18 --> 911.60]  that we've been gifted with.
[911.60 --> 913.04]  But in reality,
[913.42 --> 915.54]  we are all saved sinners.
[916.24 --> 917.06]  You cannot forget
[917.06 --> 918.20]  about the sinner's part.
[918.48 --> 919.54]  That is still part
[919.54 --> 920.14]  of our identity.
[920.52 --> 921.14]  We are saved
[921.14 --> 922.18]  by the grace of God,
[922.32 --> 923.20]  but we are still
[923.20 --> 923.68]  broken,
[923.90 --> 924.58]  fragile people
[924.58 --> 925.50]  that come together
[925.50 --> 926.72]  to try and reflect
[926.72 --> 927.48]  God's goodness
[927.48 --> 928.72]  in His body,
[928.82 --> 929.44]  His church.
[934.08 --> 935.12]  So we start
[935.12 --> 936.16]  at a place of humility
[936.16 --> 937.00]  and gentleness.
[937.00 --> 938.60]  But again,
[938.66 --> 939.66]  I still had to wrestle
[939.66 --> 940.40]  with this idea
[940.40 --> 940.84]  of, okay,
[941.12 --> 942.12]  Jesus and Paul,
[942.76 --> 943.94]  what are you talking about?
[944.28 --> 945.32]  What sort of sins,
[945.46 --> 946.26]  what sort of patterns
[946.26 --> 946.90]  of sin
[946.90 --> 949.22]  require such care
[949.22 --> 950.04]  and gentleness?
[951.82 --> 952.88]  One commentator
[952.88 --> 953.90]  defined it this way,
[953.96 --> 955.00]  which I think is correct.
[955.56 --> 956.72]  Sins that are
[956.72 --> 958.56]  deliberate acts
[958.56 --> 959.54]  of hurting the faith
[959.54 --> 960.66]  of other Christians
[960.66 --> 961.40]  by teaching
[961.40 --> 962.42]  or living
[962.42 --> 963.78]  unrepentantly,
[964.56 --> 965.38]  shamelessly,
[965.38 --> 967.30]  contrary to God's
[967.30 --> 968.30]  words and commands.
[969.10 --> 970.38]  So it's a lifestyle.
[970.58 --> 970.74]  Again,
[970.80 --> 971.30]  it's not just
[971.30 --> 972.48]  unintentional mistakes.
[972.80 --> 973.76]  It's a lifestyle
[973.76 --> 975.38]  that is contrary
[975.38 --> 976.32]  to the way
[976.32 --> 977.70]  that Jesus exemplified
[977.70 --> 978.62]  and has taught us
[978.62 --> 979.16]  to follow.
[980.88 --> 982.08]  But if you receive
[982.08 --> 982.82]  this right now
[982.82 --> 983.42]  and if you're anything
[983.42 --> 983.98]  like me,
[984.26 --> 985.38]  you sort of get
[985.38 --> 987.36]  this sensitive cringe
[987.36 --> 987.84]  and I go,
[988.28 --> 988.60]  oof,
[988.86 --> 989.60]  that sounds like
[989.60 --> 990.44]  Christian legalism.
[991.22 --> 992.04]  So you're saying
[992.04 --> 992.92]  there's a way
[992.92 --> 993.74]  of life
[993.74 --> 994.88]  that Jesus taught us,
[994.88 --> 995.96]  a way of blessing.
[996.44 --> 997.10]  And if you don't
[997.10 --> 998.20]  follow these standards,
[998.58 --> 999.20]  we are given
[999.20 --> 999.88]  the responsibility
[999.88 --> 1000.78]  to point our fingers
[1000.78 --> 1001.16]  and say,
[1001.30 --> 1001.50]  hey,
[1002.42 --> 1003.76]  WWJD, man.
[1003.92 --> 1005.20]  You shouldn't be like that.
[1006.44 --> 1007.54]  There's part of that,
[1007.64 --> 1007.90]  yes.
[1008.42 --> 1009.30]  But is it coming
[1009.30 --> 1010.10]  out of a place
[1010.10 --> 1011.16]  of care and gentleness?
[1011.50 --> 1012.26]  And also,
[1012.70 --> 1013.36]  would you do that
[1013.36 --> 1014.52]  to somebody you just met?
[1014.72 --> 1015.80]  Hey, nice to meet you.
[1015.96 --> 1016.68]  What's your sin?
[1019.56 --> 1020.00]  Obviously,
[1020.34 --> 1021.48]  I'm sort of preaching
[1021.48 --> 1022.84]  from what Jesus teaches us,
[1022.84 --> 1024.12]  but the deep dynamics
[1024.12 --> 1024.82]  of it is
[1024.82 --> 1026.34]  it has to come out.
[1026.58 --> 1027.72]  The seeking reconciliation
[1027.72 --> 1029.30]  and confronting the sin
[1029.30 --> 1030.44]  and the wrongdoing
[1030.44 --> 1031.48]  that stands against
[1031.48 --> 1032.60]  God's word
[1032.60 --> 1033.48]  and his instruction
[1033.48 --> 1034.98]  for flourishing human life,
[1035.40 --> 1035.60]  yes,
[1035.66 --> 1036.40]  it must come,
[1036.66 --> 1037.72]  but it has to come
[1037.72 --> 1038.72]  out of a place
[1038.72 --> 1039.74]  of care and gentleness
[1039.74 --> 1041.42]  and that takes time.
[1042.04 --> 1042.36]  Again,
[1042.50 --> 1042.96]  like I said,
[1043.00 --> 1043.72]  the extreme is
[1043.72 --> 1045.04]  you just meet somebody,
[1045.26 --> 1045.70]  you don't want
[1045.70 --> 1046.48]  to point your fingers.
[1046.48 --> 1048.76]  you start
[1048.76 --> 1049.74]  at a place
[1049.74 --> 1050.28]  of humility.
[1054.94 --> 1055.80]  Notice the heart
[1055.80 --> 1056.24]  of it here.
[1057.56 --> 1059.06]  I asked this question
[1059.06 --> 1059.46]  in my head,
[1059.82 --> 1060.16]  but Jesus,
[1060.30 --> 1060.94]  aren't we all sinners?
[1061.78 --> 1062.92]  What right do we have
[1062.92 --> 1063.40]  to confront
[1063.40 --> 1064.26]  somebody else's sin?
[1065.66 --> 1066.40]  Aren't we all sinners?
[1066.50 --> 1066.66]  Yes,
[1066.74 --> 1067.56]  that is the truth,
[1067.80 --> 1069.10]  but notice the heart
[1069.10 --> 1070.30]  of what Jesus is teaching
[1070.30 --> 1071.38]  and what Paul is teaching.
[1072.26 --> 1073.06]  The sins,
[1073.36 --> 1074.36]  the pattern of life,
[1074.62 --> 1075.26]  the walking
[1075.26 --> 1076.22]  and standing
[1076.22 --> 1077.18]  and sitting in the place
[1077.18 --> 1078.12]  of mockers and sinners,
[1078.24 --> 1079.18]  this lifestyle
[1079.18 --> 1081.94]  is not a one-and-done mistake
[1081.94 --> 1083.06]  or unintentional.
[1083.50 --> 1084.28]  It is something
[1084.28 --> 1085.32]  that is just embedded
[1085.32 --> 1086.42]  in somebody's life.
[1087.82 --> 1089.30]  And the heart of it is
[1089.30 --> 1090.60]  that person
[1090.60 --> 1091.72]  is unwilling
[1091.72 --> 1092.44]  to repent
[1092.44 --> 1094.20]  and shamelessly
[1094.20 --> 1094.74]  thinking,
[1094.90 --> 1095.04]  no,
[1095.24 --> 1095.92]  I don't need
[1095.92 --> 1096.92]  to change my ways.
[1097.94 --> 1099.04]  So I'm not referring
[1099.04 --> 1099.90]  to the people,
[1100.16 --> 1100.80]  to us,
[1100.80 --> 1101.80]  when we struggle
[1101.80 --> 1103.36]  against the sins
[1103.36 --> 1104.18]  that we struggle with,
[1104.32 --> 1105.00]  the good fight
[1105.00 --> 1105.92]  that we just talked about
[1105.92 --> 1106.98]  in our last sermon series.
[1108.32 --> 1109.06]  Not the,
[1109.36 --> 1110.12]  I want growth
[1110.12 --> 1110.64]  in my life.
[1110.78 --> 1111.54]  I hate that
[1111.54 --> 1112.62]  I'm still sinning
[1112.62 --> 1113.06]  this way.
[1113.36 --> 1114.06]  I'm struggling
[1114.06 --> 1114.70]  and I'm wrestling
[1114.70 --> 1115.36]  with this sin.
[1115.46 --> 1116.20]  That's not what
[1116.20 --> 1116.92]  I'm talking about.
[1117.40 --> 1118.64]  What Jesus is talking
[1118.64 --> 1119.42]  about with the sin,
[1119.50 --> 1120.40]  the pattern of life,
[1120.70 --> 1121.30]  of sin,
[1121.68 --> 1122.96]  is this lifestyle
[1122.96 --> 1123.74]  where they think,
[1124.20 --> 1125.24]  I don't need to change.
[1125.72 --> 1126.20]  Who are you
[1126.20 --> 1126.82]  to tell me?
[1127.72 --> 1128.56]  And they take
[1128.56 --> 1129.20]  God's throne
[1129.20 --> 1129.74]  and say,
[1129.74 --> 1131.18]  I'm the ultimate judge
[1131.18 --> 1131.76]  of my life.
[1132.22 --> 1132.82]  Don't tell me
[1132.82 --> 1133.32]  what to do.
[1134.36 --> 1135.08]  That's sort of
[1135.08 --> 1136.18]  the pattern of sin,
[1136.28 --> 1136.82]  a lifestyle
[1136.82 --> 1138.16]  that we are called
[1138.16 --> 1138.94]  to confront
[1138.94 --> 1139.90]  with care
[1139.90 --> 1140.64]  and gentleness.
[1143.10 --> 1143.58]  Because,
[1143.90 --> 1144.80]  as Jesus says,
[1145.16 --> 1146.20]  if they listen
[1146.20 --> 1146.60]  to you,
[1147.46 --> 1148.12]  in other words,
[1148.20 --> 1148.84]  if they listen
[1148.84 --> 1149.64]  and they repent,
[1150.64 --> 1151.86]  then you have
[1151.86 --> 1153.26]  won them over.
[1154.26 --> 1155.78]  It's such strong language.
[1155.78 --> 1156.70]  It means you have
[1156.70 --> 1157.62]  won them back
[1157.62 --> 1159.22]  into the family of God.
[1159.72 --> 1160.34]  And I don't know
[1160.34 --> 1160.94]  about you,
[1161.32 --> 1161.88]  but that just
[1161.88 --> 1162.86]  right away
[1162.86 --> 1163.54]  reminded me
[1163.54 --> 1164.52]  of the prodigal son.
[1165.34 --> 1167.04]  When the prodigal son
[1167.04 --> 1167.44]  repents
[1167.44 --> 1168.14]  and comes back
[1168.14 --> 1168.64]  to the father,
[1168.74 --> 1169.44]  the father isn't
[1169.44 --> 1170.20]  just sitting there
[1170.20 --> 1171.50]  on his prideful throne
[1171.50 --> 1171.94]  thinking,
[1172.32 --> 1172.46]  yeah,
[1172.54 --> 1173.14]  about time,
[1173.26 --> 1173.38]  buddy.
[1174.26 --> 1174.60]  No.
[1174.96 --> 1175.78]  He's just
[1175.78 --> 1176.84]  overjoyed
[1176.84 --> 1177.76]  and he runs out
[1177.76 --> 1178.22]  to his son
[1178.22 --> 1179.02]  who comes back
[1179.02 --> 1179.90]  because there is
[1179.90 --> 1181.12]  power in forgiveness
[1181.12 --> 1181.92]  and there is
[1181.92 --> 1182.86]  power and joy
[1182.86 --> 1183.68]  in reconciliation.
[1184.32 --> 1184.86]  That shalom
[1184.86 --> 1185.74]  that we're supposed
[1185.74 --> 1186.48]  to live out.
[1186.88 --> 1187.78]  There's so much
[1187.78 --> 1188.52]  joy there.
[1189.08 --> 1190.00]  That's what Jesus
[1190.00 --> 1191.82]  is instructing us
[1191.82 --> 1192.20]  to do.
[1192.60 --> 1193.48]  That's the goodness
[1193.48 --> 1194.72]  that is in store
[1194.72 --> 1195.34]  for us.
[1197.22 --> 1197.62]  And so,
[1197.72 --> 1197.90]  again,
[1197.96 --> 1198.58]  with that goal
[1198.58 --> 1199.02]  in mind,
[1199.12 --> 1199.78]  we want to head
[1199.78 --> 1200.90]  toward reconciliation.
[1201.94 --> 1202.64]  We are commanded
[1202.64 --> 1203.44]  to confront
[1203.44 --> 1204.94]  these sorts of patterns
[1204.94 --> 1206.34]  with scrupulous care
[1206.34 --> 1207.62]  for a lost
[1207.62 --> 1208.74]  brother or sister.
[1209.20 --> 1210.26]  But where do we start?
[1211.66 --> 1212.72]  We start with
[1212.72 --> 1213.44]  one-on-one,
[1213.78 --> 1215.10]  private conversation.
[1216.04 --> 1216.78]  Notice the care
[1216.78 --> 1217.56]  of detail here.
[1217.86 --> 1218.76]  Jesus starts with,
[1219.18 --> 1220.22]  go and confront them,
[1220.40 --> 1221.38]  just the two of you.
[1222.18 --> 1223.02]  You start there.
[1223.80 --> 1224.66]  You do not go
[1224.66 --> 1225.28]  with your gang
[1225.28 --> 1226.70]  of ten holy saints
[1226.70 --> 1227.26]  and go,
[1227.38 --> 1227.62]  alright,
[1228.08 --> 1229.04]  I got ten people,
[1229.22 --> 1230.16]  we all know you're sinning,
[1230.38 --> 1230.74]  let's go,
[1230.84 --> 1231.16]  come on,
[1231.32 --> 1231.74]  shape up.
[1232.24 --> 1232.48]  No.
[1232.78 --> 1233.70]  It's a caring
[1233.70 --> 1235.22]  one-on-one conversation
[1235.22 --> 1236.52]  and you start there.
[1237.56 --> 1238.56]  If that person
[1238.56 --> 1239.14]  is unwilling
[1239.14 --> 1240.08]  to listen to you,
[1240.40 --> 1240.70]  again,
[1240.70 --> 1241.28]  the next step
[1241.28 --> 1242.12]  isn't bring your
[1242.12 --> 1242.72]  whole church,
[1243.40 --> 1244.08]  the next step
[1244.08 --> 1244.88]  is bring your
[1244.88 --> 1245.38]  small group.
[1245.86 --> 1246.68]  Who are the fellow
[1246.68 --> 1247.50]  brothers and sisters
[1247.50 --> 1249.20]  who care for this
[1249.20 --> 1250.26]  lost soul right now?
[1250.70 --> 1251.56]  You bring them
[1251.56 --> 1252.28]  into the picture.
[1253.36 --> 1254.80]  But the sequence
[1254.80 --> 1255.38]  goes on.
[1256.10 --> 1256.68]  So if they're
[1256.68 --> 1257.62]  unwilling to listen
[1257.62 --> 1258.54]  to even a caring
[1258.54 --> 1259.26]  small group,
[1259.74 --> 1260.84]  then Jesus says,
[1261.32 --> 1262.12]  tell it to the pastor.
[1263.40 --> 1264.12]  He says,
[1264.22 --> 1265.24]  tell it to the church.
[1265.24 --> 1266.60]  He says,
[1266.92 --> 1268.44]  go tell the whole community.
[1268.44 --> 1274.02]  All of this sequence,
[1274.60 --> 1275.62]  all this care
[1275.62 --> 1276.30]  and detail,
[1276.80 --> 1277.90]  it's a step-by-step
[1277.90 --> 1279.16]  process that reflects
[1279.16 --> 1280.20]  loving patience
[1280.20 --> 1281.16]  because Jesus
[1281.16 --> 1282.10]  is commanding,
[1282.30 --> 1283.20]  he's instructing
[1283.20 --> 1283.82]  his body,
[1283.94 --> 1284.54]  his church,
[1284.94 --> 1285.54]  to exhaust
[1285.54 --> 1286.50]  all means
[1286.50 --> 1287.44]  to win back
[1287.44 --> 1288.14]  a lost brother
[1288.14 --> 1288.64]  or sister.
[1289.92 --> 1291.16]  Every way you can
[1291.16 --> 1292.16]  because if you think of it,
[1292.16 --> 1293.02]  if a private
[1293.02 --> 1293.92]  caring conversation
[1293.92 --> 1294.48]  doesn't work,
[1294.78 --> 1295.70]  if a private
[1295.70 --> 1296.98]  caring small group
[1296.98 --> 1297.44]  doesn't work,
[1297.50 --> 1298.06]  then you bring it
[1298.06 --> 1298.98]  to the whole church
[1298.98 --> 1299.44]  community.
[1299.88 --> 1300.50]  And now,
[1300.92 --> 1301.88]  the whole church
[1301.88 --> 1302.90]  feels the weight
[1302.90 --> 1303.68]  of the gravity
[1303.68 --> 1304.16]  of sin
[1304.16 --> 1305.86]  and how serious
[1305.86 --> 1306.60]  it can get.
[1307.80 --> 1308.86]  This is not about
[1308.86 --> 1309.48]  the whole church
[1309.48 --> 1310.56]  now pointing fingers
[1310.56 --> 1311.04]  at a sinner.
[1311.30 --> 1312.44]  It's the whole church
[1312.44 --> 1313.28]  coming together
[1313.28 --> 1314.24]  with gentleness
[1314.24 --> 1315.06]  and care
[1315.06 --> 1316.10]  with the goal
[1316.10 --> 1317.96]  of bringing back
[1317.96 --> 1319.00]  the lost sinner,
[1319.16 --> 1320.46]  not pointing our fingers
[1320.46 --> 1320.80]  and saying,
[1321.00 --> 1321.28]  get out.
[1322.48 --> 1323.54]  That's not our goal.
[1324.52 --> 1324.92]  Sometimes,
[1325.28 --> 1325.44]  yes,
[1325.50 --> 1326.36]  the reality of life
[1326.36 --> 1327.52]  is that must happen.
[1328.54 --> 1329.24]  And sometimes,
[1329.38 --> 1329.86]  reconciliation
[1329.86 --> 1331.02]  is not possible.
[1331.42 --> 1332.22]  Jesus is also
[1332.22 --> 1333.56]  not naive about that.
[1335.20 --> 1336.58]  That's the last step,
[1336.66 --> 1336.82]  right?
[1336.94 --> 1337.94]  Even if they
[1337.94 --> 1339.66]  don't even listen
[1339.66 --> 1340.60]  to the whole church
[1340.60 --> 1341.04]  community.
[1342.12 --> 1342.68]  And sometimes,
[1342.86 --> 1343.14]  sadly,
[1343.40 --> 1344.28]  that happens.
[1345.04 --> 1345.94]  That's what Pastor Dave
[1345.94 --> 1346.80]  goes into for us
[1346.80 --> 1347.28]  next week.
[1347.36 --> 1348.28]  So I'm not going to
[1348.28 --> 1349.30]  steal from his sermon
[1349.30 --> 1349.82]  from next week.
[1349.82 --> 1350.60]  We don't do that here.
[1350.78 --> 1351.32]  We don't steal.
[1351.64 --> 1352.50]  I'll leave it to him.
[1353.58 --> 1355.38]  But it is a sobering reality.
[1356.36 --> 1357.00]  Sometimes,
[1357.34 --> 1358.24]  that is impossible.
[1360.10 --> 1361.04]  Back to the point.
[1361.76 --> 1362.28]  Jesus says,
[1362.38 --> 1363.18]  tell it to the church,
[1363.22 --> 1363.38]  right,
[1363.44 --> 1364.22]  as the last step.
[1364.98 --> 1365.40]  Because,
[1365.56 --> 1366.94]  as Pastor Dave says
[1366.94 --> 1367.78]  all the time
[1367.78 --> 1368.92]  when we do baptisms here,
[1369.22 --> 1369.82]  he says something
[1369.82 --> 1370.94]  like this to us.
[1371.34 --> 1372.34]  It takes a whole village
[1372.34 --> 1373.14]  to raise a child,
[1373.26 --> 1373.44]  right?
[1373.70 --> 1374.88]  It takes a whole church
[1374.88 --> 1375.28]  community
[1375.28 --> 1376.66]  to raise each other up
[1376.66 --> 1377.32]  in faith.
[1377.64 --> 1378.68]  And that includes
[1378.68 --> 1379.52]  this as well.
[1380.88 --> 1381.36]  Sometimes,
[1381.64 --> 1383.04]  it takes a whole church
[1383.04 --> 1383.42]  community
[1383.42 --> 1384.16]  to bring back
[1384.16 --> 1384.72]  a lost sinner.
[1387.08 --> 1387.74]  I'm going to get
[1387.74 --> 1388.30]  a little nerdy
[1388.30 --> 1388.86]  on you here.
[1389.32 --> 1390.28]  I had to study this
[1390.28 --> 1391.54]  during my ordination process.
[1392.14 --> 1392.84]  But we have something
[1392.84 --> 1393.80]  called church orders.
[1394.16 --> 1395.68]  Every church denomination
[1395.68 --> 1396.86]  or tradition
[1396.86 --> 1398.08]  has something called
[1398.08 --> 1398.66]  church orders.
[1399.02 --> 1399.50]  And they're like,
[1399.56 --> 1400.32]  if you simply put,
[1400.40 --> 1401.12]  they're like guidelines
[1401.12 --> 1402.30]  for a healthy church
[1402.30 --> 1403.10]  fellowship.
[1404.12 --> 1404.84]  And part of it,
[1404.94 --> 1405.66]  Article 79,
[1406.02 --> 1407.36]  already I'm sounding nerdy,
[1407.44 --> 1407.56]  right?
[1407.76 --> 1408.40]  Church order,
[1408.52 --> 1409.82]  Article 79 says,
[1410.14 --> 1411.04]  and you'll see it up here,
[1411.04 --> 1412.96]  the members of the church
[1412.96 --> 1413.62]  are accountable
[1413.62 --> 1414.32]  to one another
[1414.32 --> 1415.24]  in their doctrine
[1415.24 --> 1415.86]  and life
[1415.86 --> 1417.24]  and have the responsibility
[1417.24 --> 1418.36]  to encourage
[1418.36 --> 1420.84]  and admonish
[1420.84 --> 1421.94]  one another in love.
[1422.02 --> 1423.02]  So that's the first part.
[1423.56 --> 1424.72]  That's the biblical basis.
[1425.18 --> 1425.88]  And then going on
[1425.88 --> 1426.30]  from there,
[1426.50 --> 1427.28]  the consistory,
[1427.68 --> 1428.74]  which is a fancy term
[1428.74 --> 1429.28]  for the elders
[1429.28 --> 1430.40]  and deacons of the church,
[1430.88 --> 1431.60]  shall instruct
[1431.60 --> 1432.82]  and remind the members
[1432.82 --> 1433.34]  of the church
[1433.34 --> 1434.52]  of their responsibility
[1434.52 --> 1436.08]  and foster a spirit
[1436.08 --> 1437.36]  of love and openness
[1437.36 --> 1438.36]  within the fellowship
[1438.36 --> 1439.66]  so that,
[1440.14 --> 1440.70]  the goal,
[1441.10 --> 1442.88]  so that erring members,
[1443.22 --> 1444.10]  sinning members
[1444.10 --> 1445.96]  may be led to repentance
[1445.96 --> 1446.94]  and reconciliation.
[1448.62 --> 1449.60]  When I was studying that,
[1449.64 --> 1450.20]  I thought that was
[1450.20 --> 1451.24]  so meaningful
[1451.24 --> 1452.64]  and so biblical,
[1453.08 --> 1454.12]  exactly from what
[1454.12 --> 1455.20]  Jesus teaches us
[1455.20 --> 1456.28]  with the goal
[1456.28 --> 1457.70]  of reconciliation,
[1458.18 --> 1459.18]  the core part
[1459.18 --> 1460.74]  of the church's identity.
[1461.30 --> 1462.22]  As Jesus says,
[1462.56 --> 1463.52]  the last step is,
[1463.52 --> 1464.98]  go tell it to the church.
[1464.98 --> 1467.38]  The church,
[1467.68 --> 1468.90]  as a body of believers,
[1469.56 --> 1470.76]  has authority.
[1471.98 --> 1473.54]  Jesus says in verse 18
[1473.54 --> 1474.52]  from Matthew 18,
[1475.56 --> 1476.44]  whatever you bind
[1476.44 --> 1477.46]  or loose on earth
[1477.46 --> 1478.10]  will be bound
[1478.10 --> 1479.14]  or loosed in heaven.
[1479.60 --> 1480.58]  That's the amount
[1480.58 --> 1481.12]  of authority
[1481.12 --> 1482.64]  that the church is given,
[1482.82 --> 1483.78]  not to an individual,
[1484.32 --> 1486.08]  but to the whole community
[1486.08 --> 1486.78]  of believers.
[1487.62 --> 1488.58]  Whatever the size
[1488.58 --> 1489.36]  of the church is,
[1489.50 --> 1490.26]  as Jesus says,
[1490.26 --> 1491.56]  even when two or three
[1491.56 --> 1492.72]  gather in my name,
[1492.96 --> 1494.16]  there I am with them.
[1494.98 --> 1496.16]  That's the authority
[1496.16 --> 1497.32]  that every single
[1497.32 --> 1498.08]  church community
[1498.08 --> 1499.38]  is given with,
[1499.58 --> 1501.36]  is given responsibility for.
[1502.58 --> 1503.50]  But again,
[1503.78 --> 1505.06]  another point of me
[1505.06 --> 1505.70]  cringing here,
[1505.82 --> 1506.16]  oof,
[1506.50 --> 1507.14]  whenever I hear
[1507.14 --> 1508.20]  authority of the church.
[1509.06 --> 1509.86]  I don't know about you,
[1509.92 --> 1511.06]  but I live,
[1511.82 --> 1512.96]  I come from a culture
[1512.96 --> 1514.80]  where I hear horror stories
[1514.80 --> 1517.16]  from mega churches in Korea
[1517.16 --> 1518.48]  where they take
[1518.48 --> 1519.46]  personal agendas
[1519.46 --> 1521.24]  and even pastors too.
[1521.40 --> 1522.46]  Yes, we're broken people.
[1522.46 --> 1524.36]  And pastors even abuse
[1524.36 --> 1525.00]  the pulpit
[1525.00 --> 1526.52]  to rebuke,
[1526.64 --> 1527.52]  openly rebuke.
[1527.58 --> 1528.46]  Yeah, following Jesus'
[1528.70 --> 1529.48]  instructions, right?
[1529.74 --> 1530.92]  But using the pulpit
[1530.92 --> 1532.16]  to openly rebuke
[1532.16 --> 1533.44]  certain individuals
[1533.44 --> 1534.98]  that they have conflict with
[1534.98 --> 1535.96]  or certain groups
[1535.96 --> 1537.08]  that they have conflict with.
[1537.70 --> 1538.94]  And you can sort of imagine
[1538.94 --> 1539.76]  what would happen.
[1541.04 --> 1542.30]  In some infamous cases,
[1542.44 --> 1543.38]  people would stand up
[1543.38 --> 1544.12]  in the middle of the sermon
[1544.12 --> 1545.12]  and start screaming back
[1545.12 --> 1546.38]  at the pastor
[1546.38 --> 1546.68]  and saying,
[1546.94 --> 1547.94]  you can't do that!
[1548.14 --> 1549.38]  You can't say that there!
[1549.38 --> 1552.26]  Don't get any ideas here.
[1554.00 --> 1555.48]  But think and imagine
[1555.48 --> 1556.82]  like a heated debate
[1556.82 --> 1558.34]  in a House of Commons meeting.
[1560.84 --> 1562.12]  But think about it.
[1562.50 --> 1563.40]  If the church,
[1563.48 --> 1564.20]  and nothing against
[1564.20 --> 1565.04]  our politicians,
[1565.90 --> 1566.98]  but if the church
[1566.98 --> 1568.24]  as the body of believers
[1568.24 --> 1569.42]  reflects exactly
[1569.42 --> 1570.72]  what the politicians do
[1570.72 --> 1571.60]  in the House of Commons,
[1571.98 --> 1573.06]  what sort of witness
[1573.06 --> 1574.40]  is the body of Christ
[1574.40 --> 1575.48]  for the world?
[1575.48 --> 1578.20]  And I hope you can see
[1578.20 --> 1578.62]  the connection
[1578.62 --> 1579.50]  to Paul's warning
[1579.50 --> 1580.18]  for us here.
[1580.74 --> 1581.46]  As Paul says
[1581.46 --> 1582.36]  in Galatians 6,
[1583.28 --> 1584.94]  be careful in your rebukes
[1584.94 --> 1586.06]  of the sins, church.
[1587.00 --> 1588.24]  Be careful when you
[1588.24 --> 1589.24]  confront the sins
[1589.24 --> 1590.06]  of your own brother
[1590.06 --> 1590.60]  or sister.
[1591.00 --> 1591.28]  Why?
[1591.68 --> 1593.28]  Because in your rebuke,
[1593.68 --> 1594.20]  in other words,
[1594.28 --> 1595.02]  in your anger
[1595.02 --> 1596.12]  against that sin,
[1596.42 --> 1597.10]  and rightly so,
[1597.16 --> 1598.06]  we should be angry
[1598.06 --> 1599.02]  against sins
[1599.02 --> 1599.54]  that are committed
[1599.54 --> 1600.22]  in the church.
[1601.14 --> 1602.68]  But in that anger,
[1603.02 --> 1604.38]  it is so easy
[1604.38 --> 1605.68]  and so tempting
[1605.68 --> 1607.42]  to sin out of that anger.
[1610.22 --> 1611.32]  An early church father
[1611.32 --> 1612.14]  says it so well.
[1612.28 --> 1612.98]  St. Augustine,
[1613.72 --> 1614.76]  touching on this topic,
[1614.86 --> 1615.56]  he says this,
[1616.26 --> 1616.80]  So then,
[1616.94 --> 1618.32]  be neither consenting
[1618.32 --> 1618.90]  to evil
[1618.90 --> 1620.94]  so as to approve sin,
[1621.66 --> 1623.20]  nor negligent
[1623.20 --> 1624.76]  so as not to reprove it
[1624.76 --> 1625.68]  and just avoid it,
[1626.74 --> 1627.98]  nor proud
[1627.98 --> 1629.60]  so as to reprove it
[1629.60 --> 1631.24]  in a tone of insult.
[1632.96 --> 1634.34]  This is hard work.
[1635.34 --> 1635.84]  Forgiveness
[1635.84 --> 1636.70]  and reconciliation.
[1637.82 --> 1638.70]  Even John Calvin,
[1638.88 --> 1640.34]  one of the early theologians,
[1640.42 --> 1640.76]  he's like,
[1641.14 --> 1642.52]  one of the hardest things
[1642.52 --> 1643.00]  to do
[1643.00 --> 1644.94]  is to care
[1644.94 --> 1646.96]  and also reprove
[1646.96 --> 1647.98]  a fellow brother
[1647.98 --> 1648.94]  or sister in the church.
[1649.22 --> 1650.60]  It's one of the hardest things
[1650.60 --> 1651.52]  to do in the church.
[1653.20 --> 1653.94]  As mentioned
[1653.94 --> 1654.36]  at the beginning
[1654.36 --> 1654.90]  of my sermon,
[1655.56 --> 1657.04]  it's much easier
[1657.04 --> 1658.24]  to avoid accountability
[1658.24 --> 1659.82]  or reprove someone's
[1659.82 --> 1660.70]  unhealthy patterns
[1660.70 --> 1661.82]  and just let them be.
[1661.92 --> 1662.92]  That's just much easier.
[1663.78 --> 1664.26]  And besides,
[1664.58 --> 1665.74]  that's what the culture,
[1666.06 --> 1667.26]  our individualistic culture
[1667.26 --> 1668.48]  today tells us anyways.
[1669.04 --> 1669.56]  Remember from
[1669.56 --> 1670.44]  our Good Fight series,
[1670.78 --> 1671.68]  the deceptive message
[1671.68 --> 1672.22]  of the world?
[1672.90 --> 1673.68]  You do you.
[1675.20 --> 1676.80]  Just follow your heart.
[1677.56 --> 1678.70]  You don't need me
[1678.70 --> 1679.82]  to point out your fault
[1679.82 --> 1681.28]  or your bad patterns
[1681.28 --> 1682.56]  or unhealthy patterns
[1682.56 --> 1684.10]  to speak into your life
[1684.10 --> 1685.84]  or journey toward growth together.
[1686.26 --> 1686.46]  No,
[1686.70 --> 1688.38]  that's way too much work.
[1689.20 --> 1689.46]  Okay,
[1689.56 --> 1690.28]  but we're a church.
[1690.34 --> 1691.18]  We need to try, right?
[1691.28 --> 1691.74]  Oh, right.
[1691.84 --> 1692.10]  Okay,
[1692.42 --> 1693.14]  we'll just hire
[1693.14 --> 1694.06]  and pay the pastors
[1694.06 --> 1694.70]  to do that.
[1695.76 --> 1696.84]  That's good enough, right?
[1698.30 --> 1698.66]  Now,
[1698.70 --> 1699.50]  I'm not trying to avoid
[1699.50 --> 1700.54]  responsibility here.
[1700.88 --> 1701.58]  We here
[1701.58 --> 1703.14]  even have a pastor of care
[1703.14 --> 1704.60]  who says that
[1704.60 --> 1705.72]  the rest of us don't care.
[1706.10 --> 1706.52]  We do.
[1706.64 --> 1707.14]  We try.
[1707.80 --> 1709.12]  But this calling
[1709.12 --> 1710.86]  and Paul's exhortation
[1710.86 --> 1711.78]  for the church
[1711.78 --> 1713.06]  is to carry
[1713.06 --> 1714.12]  one another's burdens.
[1714.82 --> 1715.96]  He did not write
[1715.96 --> 1716.46]  his letter
[1716.46 --> 1718.04]  to the Galatian Community Church
[1718.04 --> 1720.02]  just for the pastors.
[1720.92 --> 1721.80]  He wrote it
[1721.80 --> 1722.82]  to the whole church
[1722.82 --> 1723.84]  and he said
[1723.84 --> 1726.20]  carry each other's burdens.
[1729.78 --> 1731.56]  It's for the whole community.
[1732.02 --> 1733.04]  It's our identity
[1733.04 --> 1734.96]  as the body of Christ,
[1735.10 --> 1736.12]  all of us together.
[1737.74 --> 1738.96]  And so this commentator
[1738.96 --> 1740.04]  sums it up very well
[1740.04 --> 1742.26]  as he writes on Matthew 18.
[1743.16 --> 1743.88]  He says,
[1743.88 --> 1745.44]  real lovelessness,
[1746.26 --> 1747.16]  wrong judging,
[1747.80 --> 1749.54]  is to drop another person
[1749.54 --> 1750.08]  altogether
[1750.08 --> 1751.88]  without any attempt
[1751.88 --> 1753.14]  at speaking,
[1753.56 --> 1754.90]  at seeking conversations,
[1755.16 --> 1755.50]  repentance,
[1755.72 --> 1757.00]  or reconciliation at all.
[1758.22 --> 1759.26]  But in Jesus'
[1759.56 --> 1760.92]  radical teaching of grace,
[1761.72 --> 1762.58]  the sinner
[1762.58 --> 1763.98]  is taken seriously
[1763.98 --> 1764.70]  as a person
[1764.70 --> 1765.44]  and is treated
[1765.44 --> 1767.46]  as his teaching shows,
[1767.56 --> 1768.72]  as his sequence shows,
[1768.72 --> 1770.16]  with an impressive
[1770.16 --> 1771.82]  carefulness.
[1771.82 --> 1774.48]  In this way,
[1775.04 --> 1776.12]  when we seek
[1776.12 --> 1777.50]  reconciliation like this
[1777.50 --> 1778.36]  with gentleness
[1778.36 --> 1779.06]  and care,
[1779.52 --> 1780.58]  we embody
[1780.58 --> 1781.46]  a lifestyle,
[1782.46 --> 1783.16]  a lifestyle
[1783.16 --> 1784.00]  of forgiveness,
[1784.62 --> 1785.24]  a lifestyle
[1785.24 --> 1786.92]  that is spirit-led.
[1787.26 --> 1788.52]  Because when the church
[1788.52 --> 1789.84]  disciplines Christians,
[1790.66 --> 1791.84]  when we discipline
[1791.84 --> 1792.52]  each other
[1792.52 --> 1793.56]  out of care
[1793.56 --> 1794.28]  and gentleness,
[1794.82 --> 1796.58]  we more effectively
[1796.58 --> 1796.82]  disciple
[1797.34 --> 1798.38]  non-Christians.
[1799.40 --> 1800.22]  Simply put,
[1800.40 --> 1801.20]  it starts here.
[1801.82 --> 1803.00]  It starts here.
[1803.88 --> 1804.80]  That is our calling.
[1805.32 --> 1806.28]  This is our Christian
[1806.28 --> 1807.88]  mandate as the church.
[1808.26 --> 1808.74]  A humble,
[1809.18 --> 1810.02]  gentle posture
[1810.02 --> 1811.02]  of seeking healing,
[1811.40 --> 1811.78]  forgiveness,
[1812.02 --> 1813.10]  and bearing one another's
[1813.10 --> 1813.48]  burdens
[1813.48 --> 1815.48]  so that we may grow
[1815.48 --> 1817.34]  and reflect,
[1817.46 --> 1818.14]  even if it's
[1818.14 --> 1818.86]  a little bit,
[1819.36 --> 1820.44]  reflect a glimpse
[1820.44 --> 1821.44]  of God's kingdom
[1821.44 --> 1822.18]  on earth
[1822.18 --> 1823.24]  as it is in heaven.
[1824.90 --> 1825.90]  And so the invitation
[1825.90 --> 1826.40]  today,
[1826.50 --> 1827.20]  brothers and sisters,
[1827.58 --> 1828.64]  is to take a step.
[1828.64 --> 1830.56]  who is someone
[1830.56 --> 1831.66]  you care enough about
[1831.66 --> 1832.96]  to hold accountable
[1832.96 --> 1833.82]  and to seek
[1833.82 --> 1835.04]  reconciliation with?
[1836.10 --> 1837.36]  And the warning again
[1837.36 --> 1838.30]  is be careful
[1838.30 --> 1839.04]  not to sin
[1839.04 --> 1839.76]  in your anger
[1839.76 --> 1841.92]  or just to brush it off
[1841.92 --> 1842.90]  or just hold
[1842.90 --> 1843.36]  the grudge
[1843.36 --> 1844.10]  inside of you.
[1846.02 --> 1847.08]  But can you just
[1847.08 --> 1847.76]  start with a cup
[1847.76 --> 1848.26]  of coffee?
[1849.80 --> 1850.74]  Can you take
[1850.74 --> 1852.22]  one simple step
[1852.22 --> 1852.76]  at a time?
[1852.96 --> 1854.42]  Because the good news,
[1855.24 --> 1855.80]  the gospel
[1855.80 --> 1857.16]  is good news for us.
[1857.46 --> 1858.52]  It doesn't just
[1858.52 --> 1859.40]  throw challenges
[1859.40 --> 1860.14]  for us to do
[1860.14 --> 1860.84]  and fail at.
[1861.36 --> 1862.28]  The good news
[1862.28 --> 1863.86]  is that the foundation
[1863.86 --> 1865.16]  and where we lean on
[1865.16 --> 1866.30]  through every step
[1866.30 --> 1867.58]  of this hard journey
[1867.58 --> 1870.50]  is on the forgiver
[1870.50 --> 1871.86]  of all of our sins.
[1872.18 --> 1873.74]  That's where we fall back to.
[1874.14 --> 1875.28]  That's our safety net.
[1875.86 --> 1876.70]  The Holy Spirit
[1876.70 --> 1877.42]  is the one
[1877.42 --> 1878.68]  who dwells within us,
[1878.80 --> 1879.80]  who guides us
[1879.80 --> 1881.12]  every step of the way.
[1882.20 --> 1883.32]  And so that's the blessing
[1883.32 --> 1884.48]  for us this morning.
[1884.48 --> 1886.44]  May all of us
[1886.44 --> 1887.06]  be blessed
[1887.06 --> 1888.22]  and be attentive
[1888.22 --> 1889.96]  to the Holy Spirit's leading
[1889.96 --> 1890.96]  as we continue
[1890.96 --> 1892.34]  to seek to be a community
[1892.34 --> 1893.34]  of forgiveness
[1893.34 --> 1895.12]  and reconciliation.
[1896.18 --> 1897.42]  May we journey
[1897.42 --> 1898.24]  through this
[1898.24 --> 1900.30]  difficult process together.
[1901.34 --> 1902.06]  Let's pray.
[1908.90 --> 1910.70]  Loving and forgiving
[1910.70 --> 1911.32]  Father,
[1911.32 --> 1914.24]  we thank you so much
[1914.24 --> 1915.34]  that you have brought us
[1915.34 --> 1916.52]  here together
[1916.52 --> 1917.38]  as your people
[1917.38 --> 1919.14]  and you have reminded us
[1919.14 --> 1920.24]  of our identity,
[1920.46 --> 1920.58]  Lord.
[1922.42 --> 1922.98]  Lord,
[1923.12 --> 1924.26]  may we continue
[1924.26 --> 1925.28]  to be a community
[1925.28 --> 1926.08]  that seeks
[1926.08 --> 1927.06]  love,
[1928.06 --> 1929.12]  worked out
[1929.12 --> 1929.76]  in forgiveness
[1929.76 --> 1930.72]  and reconciliation,
[1931.80 --> 1933.12]  especially in those times
[1933.12 --> 1934.26]  where it seems
[1934.26 --> 1935.80]  like it's impossible.
[1935.80 --> 1938.22]  may your spirit
[1938.22 --> 1939.36]  give us the humility
[1939.36 --> 1940.76]  and the wisdom
[1940.76 --> 1941.48]  that it takes
[1941.48 --> 1941.96]  to journey
[1941.96 --> 1943.18]  through these hard steps
[1943.18 --> 1944.72]  as we seek
[1944.72 --> 1945.78]  to forgive one another
[1945.78 --> 1947.22]  just as you
[1947.22 --> 1948.22]  have forgiven us.
[1949.50 --> 1950.88]  Continue to remind us
[1950.88 --> 1952.08]  of where we come from,
[1952.36 --> 1953.20]  where we are,
[1953.80 --> 1955.08]  that we belong to you
[1955.08 --> 1956.60]  and you have called us
[1956.60 --> 1957.12]  in your grace
[1957.12 --> 1958.08]  because you,
[1958.34 --> 1959.14]  first and foremost,
[1959.54 --> 1960.32]  have forgiven us
[1960.32 --> 1961.32]  of our sins.
[1961.32 --> 1963.20]  we thank you
[1963.20 --> 1964.14]  for this good news
[1964.14 --> 1965.50]  that we get to reflect
[1965.50 --> 1966.54]  a little bit more
[1966.54 --> 1967.80]  of your love
[1967.80 --> 1968.56]  for one another
[1968.56 --> 1970.72]  and may that turn into
[1970.72 --> 1972.14]  being a witness
[1972.14 --> 1972.88]  for the world
[1972.88 --> 1973.80]  who is in darkness,
[1974.00 --> 1975.00]  who have no hope.
[1975.88 --> 1977.06]  May we be a glimpse
[1977.06 --> 1978.00]  of your shalom
[1978.00 --> 1978.62]  for the world.
[1979.52 --> 1979.96]  We thank you
[1979.96 --> 1980.76]  for this good news
[1980.76 --> 1981.54]  and in Jesus' name
[1981.54 --> 1981.94]  we pray.
[1983.10 --> 1983.40]  Amen.
[1984.46 --> 1985.80]  I invite you to stand
[1985.80 --> 1986.34]  as we sing
[1986.34 --> 1987.42]  our song response,
[1987.58 --> 1988.40]  Amazing Grace.
[1988.40 --> 2018.38]  Thank you.
