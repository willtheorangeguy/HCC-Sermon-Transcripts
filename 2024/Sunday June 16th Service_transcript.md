[0.00 --> 12.50]  Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to our service.
[12.98 --> 17.54]  I want to say again, welcome to those of you who are here for the profession of faith of
[17.54 --> 20.60]  three of our students, Cassie, Kyla, and Maya.
[21.40 --> 23.22]  And I got your name right this time, Kyla.
[23.44 --> 24.60]  A few people gave me that feedback.
[25.96 --> 29.98]  If you're new to our church, you should know that when children are born into the church,
[30.00 --> 35.68]  believing families, we baptize them as babies, and we invite them as part of God's family,
[35.78 --> 39.56]  as part of the family of faith, to take hold of that faith as they grow older.
[39.66 --> 43.44]  And this morning, we have these three students who are publicly declaring their commitment
[43.44 --> 47.88]  to Jesus Christ and His church, and today they become members of our church as well.
[49.38 --> 53.08]  There's a well-known phrase, you've probably heard it before, but it's a bit of a sobering
[53.08 --> 58.54]  line that the church of Jesus is always one generation away from becoming extinct.
[58.54 --> 64.32]  And that means that every generation of parents and leaders in the church are called to disciple
[64.32 --> 69.26]  and teach the next generation the way of Christ, the scriptures, what it means to follow Jesus.
[69.60 --> 75.18]  And every generation that comes up, our children are invited to take hold of that and make it
[75.18 --> 75.60]  their own.
[76.14 --> 80.20]  And this morning is one way where these three young women are saying, this is not my parents'
[80.32 --> 80.82]  faith only.
[81.18 --> 83.26]  This is just not a tradition that I've grown up with.
[83.26 --> 84.50]  This is a living faith.
[84.60 --> 85.48]  This is my faith.
[85.78 --> 88.48]  And I want to let people know that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[89.30 --> 93.80]  I think of that well-known line in Romans 10 where it says, if you declare with your mouth
[93.80 --> 100.38]  that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will
[100.38 --> 100.94]  be saved.
[102.38 --> 104.18]  Now, today doesn't come by accident.
[104.90 --> 108.66]  In fact, even before the service, I was talking with several people who were involved in your
[108.66 --> 109.10]  lives.
[109.48 --> 113.52]  And we realize that the grace of Jesus has come into your lives through faithful, godly
[113.52 --> 113.98]  parents.
[114.50 --> 115.66]  And we praise the Lord for that.
[116.42 --> 119.34]  It came into your lives through Cornerstone teachers, one of whom is going to lead our
[119.34 --> 119.98]  community prayer.
[120.42 --> 123.22]  It came into your lives through the pastors who've baptized you.
[123.28 --> 124.88]  And I know one of them is here this morning.
[125.28 --> 131.66]  Through teachers, friends, through praying grandparents, through great disciplers and people who've
[131.66 --> 134.04]  come alongside you in the good seasons and in the adversity.
[134.04 --> 138.30]  All of those things God has woven together to bring you to a place of saying, this is
[138.30 --> 138.94]  my faith.
[139.20 --> 140.26]  I want to follow Jesus.
[140.78 --> 141.98]  And we praise the Lord for that.
[142.48 --> 144.50]  At this time, I'm going to invite the three of you up on the stage.
[144.92 --> 147.88]  I'm going to ask you some questions about your commitment to Jesus and His church.
[148.30 --> 151.34]  And then we're going to hear you share your own stories, your testimonies of faith.
[152.92 --> 154.94]  And clearly, you called each other this morning.
[155.90 --> 159.40]  As if I had a tough enough time knowing Kyla's name.
[159.46 --> 160.40]  You all look the same.
[162.48 --> 163.54]  I didn't get the memo.
[164.04 --> 168.28]  All right.
[168.32 --> 169.76]  Now to some more serious things.
[170.56 --> 173.22]  It's a big deal to make a commitment to Christ and His church.
[173.32 --> 177.78]  And I'm going to ask you four questions and ask each of you to respond in kind with I
[177.78 --> 178.70]  will God helping me.
[179.18 --> 181.42]  And I'll give you the microphone first, Cassie.
[184.06 --> 186.82]  First, do you love Jesus Christ?
[187.74 --> 190.28]  And do you want to make following Him the goal of the rest of your life?
[190.28 --> 193.68]  Do you trust Him as the one who saves you from your sin?
[194.18 --> 197.46]  And with repentance and joy, embrace Him as the Lord of your life?
[198.70 --> 203.42]  Second, do you believe that the Scriptures are God's Word?
[203.42 --> 208.86]  Trustworthy and true, revealing Christ and His purposes for the world and for our lives?
[209.14 --> 214.80]  Third, do you promise to do all that you can with the help of the Holy Spirit to strengthen
[214.80 --> 220.04]  your love and your commitment to Christ by sharing faithfully in the life of the church,
[220.60 --> 224.42]  honoring its authority and giving yourselves to serving?
[224.42 --> 229.88]  Fourth and finally, will you commit to growing in your faith, devoting yourself to the disciplines
[229.88 --> 235.50]  that foster your life in Christ, and seeking to use the gifts that God has given you to
[235.50 --> 237.70]  serve His kingdom and to bless this city?
[238.62 --> 239.72]  Cassie, what is your answer?
[240.18 --> 241.40]  I do, God helping me.
[242.06 --> 243.18]  Maya, what is your answer?
[243.54 --> 244.82]  I do, God helping me.
[245.04 --> 246.14]  And Kyla, what is your answer?
[246.38 --> 247.66]  I do, God helping me.
[247.92 --> 248.22]  Amen.
[248.22 --> 254.42]  Now, church, it takes a village to raise people in the faith of Jesus, and I ask you to stand
[254.42 --> 255.62]  because I have a question for you.
[259.66 --> 265.44]  Do you, brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ in this church, receive these three young women
[265.44 --> 267.68]  as members, as part of this family of faith?
[268.18 --> 274.12]  Do you promise to love them, to pray for them, and to encourage them as God gives you opportunity?
[274.58 --> 275.40]  What is your answer?
[276.10 --> 276.76]  We do.
[277.06 --> 278.00]  God helping us.
[278.22 --> 278.66]  Amen.
[278.86 --> 279.64]  You may find your seats.
[280.50 --> 283.58]  At this time, I'm going to invite the three of you to share your story of how God's grace
[283.58 --> 285.38]  has shaped and molded your lives.
[288.66 --> 289.10]  Okay.
[289.68 --> 290.26]  Thank you.
[292.14 --> 292.54]  Okay.
[295.00 --> 298.36]  Okay, so my name is Cassie Hoidema, and I'm sharing my testimony.
[299.06 --> 300.60]  I grew up in a Christian household.
[300.98 --> 304.58]  Both my parents are Christians and taught me the importance of a relationship with Christ.
[304.58 --> 308.42]  However, I was living in my parents' faith rather than my own.
[309.06 --> 313.36]  I went to a Christian school from kindergarten to grade 12, and I never realized how privileged
[313.36 --> 315.12]  I was to have been taught with a Christian mindset.
[316.08 --> 319.92]  For me, though, I just went about life, going to church and youth group because it was a routine
[319.92 --> 322.00]  rather than because I actually wanted to.
[322.00 --> 325.70]  Fast forward a few years, and the world went into complete isolation.
[326.48 --> 329.30]  I wanted a relationship with God, but for the wrong reasons.
[329.88 --> 334.84]  I wanted it because my friends seemed to have these deep relationships with Christ, so I was
[334.84 --> 335.58]  just trying to keep up.
[335.58 --> 339.78]  I would attempt to read the Bible, but not actually know what I was reading or care to
[339.78 --> 340.40]  understand it.
[340.78 --> 344.44]  I would not prioritize watching church online as there were so many other things I would
[344.44 --> 347.20]  rather be doing, and it kind of acted like background noise.
[347.66 --> 349.42]  My passion for God was just not there.
[349.92 --> 353.86]  I was not putting time to grow my relationship with Him compared to the amount of time I was
[353.86 --> 357.06]  putting to other things like sports, school, and friendships.
[357.06 --> 361.38]  It was not until about 10th grade when my mindset started to shift.
[361.82 --> 366.04]  I realized that if I wanted a relationship with God, I was going to have to work for it.
[366.52 --> 370.16]  This meant making time for God, reading His Word, as well as being willing to listen.
[370.86 --> 373.64]  I got the opportunity to go on a sailing trip with my class.
[374.16 --> 378.36]  Through this trip, I was overwhelmed by the power of God through nature, community, and worship.
[379.52 --> 382.38]  After this trip, I made an effort to grow my relationship with Him.
[382.68 --> 386.92]  I started engaging in chapels, listening to sermons, and trying to challenge my thinking.
[387.76 --> 389.74]  At this point, though, there was still something missing.
[390.14 --> 393.78]  I was waiting for my God moment, you know, that moment that you hear about when God came
[393.78 --> 395.20]  through at tough times and struggles.
[396.08 --> 399.76]  This thought came to me because all the testimonies I had heard had one of these moments.
[401.10 --> 405.14]  At the beginning of the school year, I went to Rock Ridge Canyon with my grad class.
[405.50 --> 408.98]  This opened my eyes to see that your God moment doesn't have to be a time of heartache,
[408.98 --> 410.52]  but it can also be a time of great joy.
[411.66 --> 415.24]  I started reflecting and realizing how blessed I have been to not have gone through this kind
[415.24 --> 415.70]  of heartache.
[415.70 --> 420.88]  Many of the people that are here today, like my parents, grandparents, extended family,
[420.98 --> 424.48]  and friends, have shown me what it's like to live as a child of God and have helped shape
[424.48 --> 429.54]  me into the person I am today through meaningful conversations, giving advice, as well as being
[429.54 --> 430.22]  a listening ear.
[430.84 --> 434.56]  I'm very excited to see how God uses me in the future and how I can continue to grow my
[434.56 --> 435.44]  relationship with Him.
[435.44 --> 439.30]  These are a few reasons why I'm beyond grateful and blessed to make my faith my own.
[439.30 --> 441.08]  Thank you.
[441.08 --> 441.58]  Thank you.
[441.58 --> 442.22]  Thank you.
[442.22 --> 442.48]  Thank you.
[442.48 --> 442.84]  Thank you.
[450.84 --> 454.02]  Hi, my name is Maya Van Rink, and this is my testimony.
[454.92 --> 459.62]  So, one of the biggest blessings in my life is that I grew up in a Christian home with amazing
[459.62 --> 461.38]  parents that made our home Christ-centered.
[462.10 --> 465.92]  Church was our regular Sunday morning activity that was just a given, and I knew no different.
[466.80 --> 469.22]  As a kid, I never knew how lucky I was for this.
[469.78 --> 474.48]  Other than church on Sunday, I always knew to pray before a meal, before bed, and to read the Bible after dinner.
[475.18 --> 479.96]  That was the routine. This was what I was supposed to do, but I never truly knew why.
[481.06 --> 485.20]  This was a foundation from my parents, but it was their relationship with God, not mine.
[485.96 --> 489.90]  It all began to change when I went to high school, and life was not so simple anymore.
[491.16 --> 494.46]  It did not help that in my first year of high school, there was a pandemic.
[494.46 --> 501.12]  But during COVID, I did little to nothing to grow my faith, and it was hard to when I felt like I had nobody around me.
[501.44 --> 505.88]  I missed my friends, playing sports, and just the environment of being around others.
[506.46 --> 509.92]  I was not motivated to do anything, including Christian practices.
[510.60 --> 515.64]  I had a hard time listening when church was online, and Sunday mornings ended up being my weekly coloring time.
[516.70 --> 521.72]  However, through this, I learned the importance that community and interactions are to me.
[521.72 --> 525.30]  Although the beginning of high school was rough, it changed.
[526.00 --> 530.24]  In grade 10, I knew I needed to figure out Christianity and what my faith really is,
[530.36 --> 536.34]  because church and the whole idea of being a Christian ended up feeling more like a chore after having two rough years.
[537.06 --> 542.88]  I was curious, and I always wished I knew more about my religion when people asked, or even when I would question myself.
[542.88 --> 545.14]  This is when Misha came.
[546.08 --> 550.48]  I remember the youth night she introduced the importance of silence.
[551.88 --> 554.62]  And I decided this was a practice I was going to start doing.
[555.28 --> 559.38]  I did this because I was not sure where to start, and this was often my problem.
[559.88 --> 563.58]  I was always so busy, and I never gave myself time to focus and look to him.
[563.58 --> 570.10]  I would sit in silence for one minute in the morning and one in the evening to reflect and think about God
[570.10 --> 574.62]  and see what stopping my busy brain from the world around me would do to help grow my faith.
[575.68 --> 582.48]  Around that time, I also started doing devotions in the morning, praying more, and reading the Bible every night before bed,
[583.48 --> 588.04]  to both learn and build my connection and relationship with God.
[588.04 --> 597.60]  I finally felt like I was beginning to truly know Jesus, and I took time to learn intentionally and to intentionally learn to the sermons.
[599.08 --> 601.56]  Going to church around this time changed for me a lot.
[602.12 --> 607.42]  Not only was I listening more and beginning to take the message of the sermons in, but I also began to sing.
[608.42 --> 611.90]  I loved worship through singing, and this made me want to go to church on Sundays.
[612.62 --> 615.36]  I kept these practices throughout the last two years of high school,
[615.36 --> 619.04]  and every day my relationship with God was building and strengthening into my own.
[619.96 --> 623.38]  Because of this, I felt God was helping me enjoy life to a bigger extent.
[625.60 --> 629.82]  And I was and am starting to understand who I am and why I'm here.
[630.70 --> 635.62]  The last years of high school was also when our youth small group formed, and this helped me in so many ways.
[636.34 --> 641.88]  God provided me this group where I was able to talk and process being a Christian and how to live in the world as one.
[641.88 --> 649.10]  I could grow my faith with them walking beside me, and they created a space where I could wrestle with my faith and with their support.
[649.96 --> 651.42]  Now I cannot forget about my parents.
[652.20 --> 655.68]  I'm not sure where I'd be today in my faith journey without my parents.
[656.56 --> 662.54]  They opened a home where me and my siblings could ask questions, have chats, and learn from and with them about Christianity,
[662.86 --> 665.82]  and have been inspiring parents to watch and learn from as I grow up.
[665.82 --> 672.60]  I'm now happy to say that in the beginning of high school, I fully depended on my parents' faith,
[672.76 --> 676.90]  but now as I finished high school two days ago and leave a part of my childhood,
[677.34 --> 680.40]  I know that my faith is my own, and that's why I'm here professing my faith.
[680.40 --> 694.40]  Hi, my name is Kyla Gerber, and this is my testimony.
[695.54 --> 699.96]  I'm incredibly fortunate to have been born in a Christian household where attending church,
[700.40 --> 705.08]  praying before meals and bedtimes, and reading the Bible were prioritized from an early age.
[705.50 --> 709.32]  These rituals helped shape my understanding of faith and what it means to be a Christian.
[709.32 --> 717.48]  While these practices helped me gain a solid foundation, my journey to fully embrace my faith as my own didn't begin until high school.
[718.12 --> 724.18]  During my grade eight year, I felt compelled to dive deeper into the Bible and gain a more personal relationship with God.
[724.76 --> 729.46]  I was inspired by my sister Amanda, who had read through the entire Bible cover to cover,
[729.70 --> 731.96]  and I decided to challenge myself to do the same.
[732.76 --> 738.32]  Every morning, I would dedicate an hour to reading the Bible, gaining a deeper understanding of the scriptures.
[738.32 --> 745.54]  Through this process, my faith grew significantly, and I felt as though I was growing closer to God as well as growing as a person.
[746.28 --> 750.34]  Those hours reading the Bible were more than just an exercise in devotions.
[750.62 --> 755.70]  They also helped me gain a deeper understanding that shaped who I am as a person as well as my worldview.
[757.02 --> 760.12]  God has gifted me with the ability to sing and write songs.
[760.12 --> 766.30]  Ever since I was a young girl, I expressed my love for music, and I am truly grateful for the voice that I have been given.
[767.00 --> 772.90]  I therefore feel called to serve in the community by sharing my talents in singing and playing guitar for worship.
[773.68 --> 781.06]  Additionally, God has blessed me with a big heart, caring deeply for those around me and empathizing with those in pain, especially my family.
[781.80 --> 785.06]  Giving to others gives me joy as I love to make those around me happy.
[785.06 --> 790.64]  I am thankful for these gifts that God has given me and the opportunity to use them for the good of others.
[791.32 --> 793.20]  I have not reached this point on my own.
[793.54 --> 796.38]  I would not be here today professing my faith without my mom and dad.
[796.98 --> 803.16]  They have been the foundation of my faith, raising me up to trust in God and to believe He has a plan for my life.
[803.60 --> 809.22]  As my dad always says, my identity is not defined by what others think of me, but rather my identity is in God.
[809.22 --> 813.30]  I know that He loves me and cares for me always, and that will never change.
[813.92 --> 818.36]  Therefore, I am here today to give myself to God and to strive to live how Jesus did.
[819.10 --> 823.42]  The verse I would like to leave you all with is the verse that was used for my baptism.
[824.26 --> 829.42]  Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.
[829.62 --> 830.96]  Luke 18, verse 17.
[830.96 --> 831.96]  Thank you.
[839.22 --> 846.26]  So at this time, what we've already alluded to, that they were baptized as babies.
[846.52 --> 855.06]  And it's through that faith and baptism and the commitment of the church and their families that they have been raised.
[855.06 --> 858.60]  And the faith of the gospel working in their lives, as we've just heard.
[859.04 --> 867.92]  And so for a moment, I'm going to invite each of the girls over to the table to return their hands to the bowl that they symbolically were baptized in as babies.
[867.92 --> 874.56]  And I'm just going to have a word of prayer for them to honor and thank God and to pray blessing over them and their lives to come.
[897.92 --> 898.92]  Thank you.
[927.92 --> 928.92]  Thank you.
[928.92 --> 929.92]  Thank you.
[957.92 --> 958.92]  Thank you.
[987.92 --> 990.26]  пока под Ber
[1006.86 --> 1009.32]  Speaker 2
[1009.32 --> 1015.58]  At this time, I would like to invite the family of each of the girls, our youth leaders, to come up and pray,
[1015.58 --> 1017.22]  and even share a scripture with them.
[1018.90 --> 1019.42]  Yeah.
[1045.58 --> 1061.26]  I don't know who wants to start, but we can just pass the mic,
[1061.36 --> 1064.58]  and then I'll finish praying for us when we're done.
[1070.16 --> 1072.72]  I know this is a time of transition,
[1072.72 --> 1079.40]  and as you go through graduating, and we're so proud of you.
[1080.40 --> 1083.42]  And just know that the Lord is your rock.
[1084.02 --> 1088.90]  And I want to leave you with this scripture verse of Isaiah 41, verse 10 to 13.
[1089.60 --> 1093.62]  So do not be afraid, for I am with you.
[1094.14 --> 1097.80]  Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
[1098.32 --> 1100.46]  I will strengthen you and help you.
[1100.46 --> 1103.38]  I will uphold you with my righteous right hand,
[1103.56 --> 1108.36]  for I am the Lord your God, who takes hold of your right hand
[1108.36 --> 1114.10]  and says, do not fear, for I am with you.
[1114.10 --> 1126.04]  True to form, with our family, I don't always come prepared,
[1126.56 --> 1128.30]  but hopefully that the Spirit leads.
[1129.50 --> 1135.90]  So I'm kind of reflecting on one of the chapters in the Bible,
[1135.90 --> 1142.98]  that our family has kind of circled their life is Philippians 4.
[1143.48 --> 1146.16]  And there's two areas, two pieces of that.
[1146.24 --> 1148.46]  One, rejoice in the Lord always.
[1149.12 --> 1151.22]  And so I want to say that no matter what happens.
[1151.28 --> 1154.00]  And later on it talks about praying continuously.
[1154.68 --> 1157.94]  And do not be anxious about everything, and pray with thanksgiving.
[1157.94 --> 1160.78]  So I will say that we're very, very thankful.
[1160.92 --> 1163.90]  We're very, very thankful for everybody in this whole community
[1163.90 --> 1165.98]  and the community that the church we came from,
[1166.48 --> 1168.96]  how they impacted Maya's life.
[1169.04 --> 1170.64]  And so we're exceptionally grateful.
[1170.64 --> 1178.76]  Well, Kyla, many years ago you were baptized, as you mentioned in your talk,
[1179.54 --> 1182.02]  and Neil Plantinga actually baptized you,
[1182.86 --> 1185.04]  and talked about being receivers,
[1185.64 --> 1189.12]  that unless we enter into the kingdom of heaven like a little child,
[1189.72 --> 1195.88]  we cannot enter the kingdom of heaven unless we receive like a child in great humility.
[1196.58 --> 1199.06]  And so the promise from Scripture that I want you to receive today
[1199.06 --> 1202.68]  is from Jeremiah 29, 11, where God says,
[1202.92 --> 1206.66]  I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you,
[1207.08 --> 1210.18]  and not to harm you, to give you life and a future.
[1210.40 --> 1213.60]  This does not mean that life is going to be without trouble.
[1214.06 --> 1218.92]  It means that ultimately God is making all things new, including us.
[1219.20 --> 1221.46]  Our great hope is new creation.
[1221.90 --> 1224.90]  And it begins now as we walk with the source of life.
[1225.30 --> 1226.12]  So walk with him.
[1226.12 --> 1233.78]  So I'm going to start us off in our prayer, and Misha is going to end the prayer.
[1234.24 --> 1239.28]  But first of all, we're so proud of you all for taking this next step in your faith,
[1239.28 --> 1244.54]  and we look forward to all that is to come in your lives.
[1244.54 --> 1253.08]  Heavenly Father, thank you so much for the presence that you have brought in the families
[1253.08 --> 1263.42]  to just spread your word and love into all of the life that these girls have had here on earth.
[1263.42 --> 1271.30]  We pray that as they continue on in their next steps of their lives,
[1271.44 --> 1273.76]  whether they graduated or starting grade 12,
[1274.58 --> 1283.62]  we pray that they continue on with all of these special times with you,
[1283.92 --> 1288.40]  their one hour of reading, their one minute of silence twice a day.
[1288.40 --> 1294.48]  We pray that they continue these so that they can continue to grow deeper in their faith with you, Lord,
[1294.94 --> 1302.50]  and that we can continue to come alongside them with you, Lord,
[1302.56 --> 1309.34]  to help encourage them to keep on coming back to your fold, Lord, with any questions.
[1309.34 --> 1317.48]  And we just pray that they can be a light to all of those around them as they deepen their faith, Lord.
[1317.68 --> 1324.06]  We are so very thankful that you have provided these beautiful people in our lives
[1324.06 --> 1329.04]  so that we can get to know them, and they can also be a light to us leaders as well.
[1331.32 --> 1334.42]  God, I thank you for your goodness in each of these girls' lives.
[1334.42 --> 1339.74]  I thank you that it's been evident through their stories that you have been working from the beginning,
[1339.98 --> 1342.60]  and I just pray that you would continue working until the end.
[1343.28 --> 1347.74]  May they be lights that radiate in their families, in their friend groups, in their communities,
[1348.08 --> 1351.34]  in their schools, wherever they find themselves over the course of their lives.
[1352.24 --> 1355.26]  And may they continue to lift up and glorify your name.
[1356.38 --> 1360.02]  May they always point people around them to you
[1360.02 --> 1364.50]  and be reminded that you are with them and within them through your spirit.
[1365.16 --> 1367.24]  I just pray blessing over them and their families.
[1367.82 --> 1368.30]  Thank you.
[1368.68 --> 1372.32]  Thank you for the gift that you are in their lives.
[1372.74 --> 1373.84]  I pray all this in your name.
[1373.98 --> 1374.18]  Amen.
[1376.10 --> 1376.74]  Thank you.
[1376.86 --> 1377.62]  You can have a seat.
[1378.12 --> 1379.02]  Before...
[1385.02 --> 1387.36]  I do have a little gift for each of you girls.
[1387.36 --> 1392.54]  That's a little book to help continue to answer some questions of faith that will help root you.
[1393.54 --> 1395.64]  And Maddie has some flowers.
[1396.80 --> 1403.02]  And speaking of gifts, we are also going to be graced by Kyla using her gifts of music
[1403.02 --> 1407.32]  and singing a song that she wrote as a worship song for us.
[1407.40 --> 1410.96]  And if she wants to say anything else when she does that, she can do that.
[1410.96 --> 1411.02]  Thank you.
[1411.02 --> 1412.02]  Thank you.
[1417.36 --> 1424.70]  Hi, everyone.
[1425.64 --> 1428.08]  So I'm going to be singing a song that I wrote.
[1428.46 --> 1431.10]  I wrote it like two months ago or so.
[1431.10 --> 1434.42]  And I don't really have a reason for writing it.
[1434.46 --> 1436.30]  I just really wanted to write a Christian song.
[1436.94 --> 1439.70]  And so I kind of just like thought about it.
[1439.72 --> 1441.54]  I was like, oh, I really want to write a Christian song.
[1441.60 --> 1443.68]  And then it kind of just came to me.
[1443.98 --> 1446.08]  And I was like, oh, this is actually pretty good.
[1446.20 --> 1450.14]  So then I picked up my guitar and I started playing.
[1450.82 --> 1453.56]  And then, yeah, it just, yeah, it came to me.
[1453.92 --> 1456.08]  Anyway, this song is called Worship You.
[1456.34 --> 1457.30]  And I hope you guys like it.
[1457.30 --> 1460.10]  And the lyrics will also be on the screen.
[1460.10 --> 1482.58]  You are the Lord, my God, forever holy.
[1482.58 --> 1487.58]  And I will worship you.
[1487.58 --> 1496.54]  You are the Lord, my God, forever holy.
[1497.54 --> 1501.38]  And I will worship you.
[1502.42 --> 1504.92]  You take me to the water.
[1505.92 --> 1508.20]  You fill my soul with peace.
[1508.20 --> 1513.54]  I know you love me always.
[1515.20 --> 1518.62]  And I know that you are holy.
[1519.20 --> 1524.46]  Every single day you surround me.
[1525.00 --> 1528.20]  With everything that I need.
[1529.20 --> 1530.20]  Oh, yeah.
[1531.02 --> 1532.32]  chiffon plus MORlevics lives.
[1532.54 --> 1540.38]  And I can't get through.
[1540.90 --> 1551.20]  If you are the Lord, my God, forever holy.
[1551.20 --> 1554.82]  Forever holy
[1554.82 --> 1559.78]  And I will worship you
[1559.78 --> 1565.20]  You are the Lord my God
[1565.20 --> 1568.68]  Forever holy
[1568.68 --> 1573.68]  And I will worship you
[1573.68 --> 1574.60]  Yeah
[1574.60 --> 1583.44]  You're there for me
[1583.44 --> 1587.12]  In my darkest time
[1587.12 --> 1590.48]  When I am weak
[1590.48 --> 1594.14]  You're my strength, my mind
[1594.14 --> 1597.82]  You're the only constant
[1597.82 --> 1600.90]  In my life
[1600.90 --> 1603.88]  And I will sing
[1603.88 --> 1610.92]  You're there for me
[1610.92 --> 1614.52]  In my darkest time
[1614.52 --> 1617.86]  When I am weak
[1617.86 --> 1621.52]  You're my strength, my mind
[1621.52 --> 1625.12]  You're the only constant
[1625.12 --> 1627.76]  In my life
[1627.76 --> 1634.16]  And I will sing to you
[1634.16 --> 1640.20]  You are the Lord my God
[1640.20 --> 1644.48]  Forever holy
[1644.48 --> 1649.36]  And I will worship you
[1649.36 --> 1655.20]  You are the Lord my God
[1655.20 --> 1658.66]  Forever holy
[1658.66 --> 1664.24]  And I will worship you
[1664.24 --> 1668.44]  And I will solo
[1668.44 --> 1671.84]  For you
[1671.84 --> 1673.44]  And I will worship you
[1673.44 --> 1673.76]  You are the more
[1673.76 --> 1674.56]  You are the Old earth
[1674.56 --> 1674.88]  You are the only place
[1674.88 --> 1675.44]  You are the only place
[1675.44 --> 1676.38]  You are the only place
[1676.38 --> 1695.74]  Good morning, everyone.
[1696.60 --> 1697.84]  Thank you so much, Kyla.
[1698.70 --> 1700.22]  My name is Ken Volkanant.
[1700.76 --> 1705.22]  For those who don't know me, I've been a member of this church for many, many years.
[1705.22 --> 1711.84]  And as I said this morning, the earlier service, kind of a real full circle moment for me.
[1713.46 --> 1714.92]  Actually, let me start with something.
[1715.56 --> 1722.28]  I'm going to invite our little ones, age three to grade three, to head up the Cornerstone class.
[1722.28 --> 1738.34]  And this group of little people who are stampeding out of here is part of the full circle moment for me.
[1738.34 --> 1747.82]  So very early in my days, coming to this church and becoming part of the community, I found myself serving in that day's version of Cornerstone.
[1748.38 --> 1752.64]  And I really loved working with the age three to five group.
[1752.96 --> 1755.32]  I just find those little people fascinating.
[1755.32 --> 1762.52]  So now God has blessed me with grandchildren in that same age group, and I continue in my fascination for them.
[1762.84 --> 1771.10]  And I so appreciate when they head up to Cornerstone that even in the next few minutes, they will be hearing about the love of Jesus and the love of God.
[1771.60 --> 1774.52]  And it will be part of their own growth and transformation.
[1774.52 --> 1784.64]  So the full story moment is that 15 years ago or so, when I was teaching, those grade threes, I started age three to five, had a little girl that was part of that group.
[1784.76 --> 1785.58]  Her name was Kyla.
[1786.62 --> 1789.04]  Her and her cousin Luke were in that group with me.
[1789.70 --> 1793.70]  She was super shy, cute, didn't say too much.
[1793.86 --> 1800.10]  And now today I'm seeing her up here singing a song that she wrote, praising the Lord and bringing glory to Him.
[1800.10 --> 1810.82]  And it should be a reminder to all of us that everything we pour into those children, including their time in Cornerstone, makes a difference and brings them to this place.
[1811.34 --> 1816.28]  So for those of you parents whose little ones have just headed up the stairs, be encouraged.
[1817.12 --> 1818.72]  You know, in 15 years they'll be up here singing.
[1821.14 --> 1824.48]  It's a very beautiful thing and a privilege for us to be able to serve in that way.
[1825.06 --> 1826.58]  So, happy Father's Day.
[1826.58 --> 1833.80]  All of you who are fathers out there, I love Father's Day because it's obviously nice to be a dad and to have a dad and those things.
[1833.98 --> 1844.12]  But we have a Heavenly Father and it's a really special thing to be able to use this day beyond the earthly father and think about the blessings we have in our Heavenly Father.
[1845.14 --> 1850.58]  And it reminded me of a verse that I always really appreciated, which I'll just share with you.
[1850.58 --> 1858.44]  What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent?
[1859.10 --> 1863.02]  Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
[1864.24 --> 1870.30]  So if your child or your grandchild or a very good friend of yours comes to you and asks you for something,
[1871.66 --> 1876.42]  you will try to give them what they ask for to the best of your human ability.
[1876.42 --> 1879.84]  That's what we do for people who we love.
[1880.68 --> 1883.80]  And we have a Heavenly Father who loves us as well.
[1883.90 --> 1887.26]  And sometimes we make this whole thing about prayer a little too complicated.
[1887.42 --> 1892.72]  I think God is a Father and he's asking us to ask him what we want.
[1893.48 --> 1896.36]  And he's inviting us to ask him what we want.
[1896.78 --> 1901.86]  So as all of us come together in community prayer, I encourage you, have no fear.
[1901.96 --> 1904.52]  Be bold in asking God what it is you want.
[1904.52 --> 1908.86]  Now, he may not always give you exactly what you ask for.
[1909.54 --> 1912.44]  You may not get the fish and you may not get the egg.
[1912.96 --> 1916.62]  But know that you're not getting the snake and you're not getting the scorpion.
[1917.04 --> 1922.36]  And if he doesn't give you your fish or egg, he's got something much better in store for you that you don't even know you need.
[1922.92 --> 1924.38]  That's the good father we serve.
[1924.46 --> 1926.14]  And that's the good father we're going to pray to now.
[1926.34 --> 1927.76]  And I invite you to join me in prayer.
[1927.76 --> 1936.12]  Our Heavenly Father, we thank you that you are our Father and that you are good.
[1936.78 --> 1943.56]  We thank you that you invite us to come to you as little children and to ask you for the things we want.
[1944.28 --> 1946.52]  We confess we don't always know what to ask for.
[1946.52 --> 1952.42]  And sometimes it is just best for us to sit in silence before you as a loving and great Heavenly Father.
[1953.44 --> 1956.94]  But help us to be bold, to ask you those things that are at our heart.
[1957.58 --> 1962.18]  And by your Spirit, help us to live out those things in our lives.
[1963.12 --> 1967.60]  We thank you that you are our Heavenly Father, not just to us and not this community, but to the world.
[1967.60 --> 1970.06]  And Lord, as we look around us, we see a lot of disarray.
[1970.58 --> 1972.36]  We see wars and strife.
[1972.50 --> 1973.38]  We see suffering.
[1974.10 --> 1975.34]  And it brings us pain.
[1976.16 --> 1983.82]  We ask, Lord, we ask boldly that you would bring peace and healing in these very difficult situations.
[1984.56 --> 1988.52]  We ask that you would be present for those who are suffering, that they would feel your presence,
[1988.88 --> 1990.90]  and that you would give them your peace and healing.
[1992.14 --> 1996.70]  We pray, Lord, for those who are gathered in Grand Rapids this week at Synod.
[1996.70 --> 1999.94]  We pray, Lord, for those who are living in the world, wrestling with some difficult questions and issues.
[2000.58 --> 2002.20]  We ask, Lord, that you would give wisdom.
[2002.34 --> 2010.24]  We ask, Lord, boldly that you would give unity to those who are deliberating over important things that matter to our churches.
[2010.80 --> 2012.28]  Things that will help us to grow.
[2012.92 --> 2015.30]  We pray, Lord, for your presence and your wisdom there.
[2015.82 --> 2017.06]  Lord, we pray for this community.
[2017.24 --> 2021.76]  It is no accident that we are here in this church, in this place, on this piece of land.
[2022.08 --> 2023.78]  You have called us to this place.
[2023.78 --> 2033.48]  And help us, Lord, to be your instruments to serve those around us and to share the love of God and the salvation of Jesus Christ.
[2033.78 --> 2038.00]  To those who we have as our neighbors and those that live immediately around us.
[2038.96 --> 2043.36]  Father, we ask that you would be with those in our community here today that are hurting.
[2043.36 --> 2047.26]  Lord, for those who are struggling because of illness.
[2048.46 --> 2051.32]  The things that hurt us physically are hard, Lord.
[2051.42 --> 2052.66]  It's difficult to see you.
[2052.70 --> 2056.76]  But we come before you as little children and ask that you would bring healing.
[2057.32 --> 2058.54]  Healing to our lives.
[2058.76 --> 2060.58]  Healing to the pain that we experience.
[2061.14 --> 2063.94]  The healing that you can bring with your miraculous touch.
[2063.94 --> 2074.66]  We ask, Lord, for those whose pain is not physical, but where it is the agonizing difficulty of waking up every day and facing the day.
[2075.22 --> 2077.04]  Where dark thoughts take over.
[2077.34 --> 2078.88]  Where anxiety overwhelms.
[2079.16 --> 2082.36]  We ask, Lord, that by your spirit you would lift the darkness.
[2083.04 --> 2090.12]  That you would provide healing to those of us who struggle with the daily basics of living.
[2090.12 --> 2097.18]  You are a good father and we thank you that you invite us to ask of you boldly.
[2097.84 --> 2103.84]  And this morning, Lord, as we continue in the service and as your servant shares his word with us about the Holy Spirit.
[2104.70 --> 2106.76]  And how that makes everything different.
[2107.36 --> 2109.26]  Help those words to sink deep within us.
[2109.38 --> 2114.34]  Help us, Lord, to recognize the power that comes by you dwelling in us.
[2114.72 --> 2115.86]  And encourage us.
[2117.04 --> 2119.12]  Thank you for being a loving Heavenly Father.
[2119.12 --> 2120.92]  Thank you for listening to our prayer.
[2121.32 --> 2125.06]  We look forward to how you will answer these prayers of your children.
[2125.54 --> 2126.96]  In Jesus' name, Amen.
[2136.32 --> 2137.00]  Thanks, Ken.
[2141.44 --> 2144.62]  I appreciate that scripture that Ken mentioned before his prayer.
[2144.62 --> 2146.88]  Because it ties into our series.
[2146.88 --> 2149.90]  The thing that God promises that Jesus says in the passages.
[2150.04 --> 2153.70]  How much more will the Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask?
[2154.36 --> 2159.28]  And if you're visiting today or you're new to our church, you should know that we've been preaching a series on the Holy Spirit.
[2160.10 --> 2161.92]  And at the 9 a.m. my sermon wasn't short.
[2162.00 --> 2165.14]  I'm feeling a little bit of pressure to shorten that sermon at 11 a.m.
[2165.76 --> 2168.88]  But we've been looking at the way the Spirit moves in the church.
[2169.20 --> 2171.12]  How to live a life that is full of the Spirit.
[2171.12 --> 2174.54]  In the coming weeks, we're looking at spiritual gifts and spiritual fruit.
[2175.10 --> 2180.36]  And this morning, I modified our series just a little bit to focus a little bit on this profession of faith.
[2180.44 --> 2183.00]  And I'm going to be preaching on Romans chapter 8.
[2183.44 --> 2185.32]  That speaks so powerfully of the Spirit.
[2185.44 --> 2190.04]  And if you have your Bible, whether digital or physical, turn with me to Romans 8 and we'll read this together.
[2190.04 --> 2198.54]  Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[2198.54 --> 2206.06]  Because through Christ Jesus, the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[2206.92 --> 2210.58]  For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the sinful nature,
[2211.26 --> 2216.76]  God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful humanity to be a sin offering.
[2216.76 --> 2223.84]  And so he condemned sin in human flesh in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us
[2223.84 --> 2228.04]  who do not live according to the sinful nature, but according to the Spirit.
[2229.08 --> 2233.34]  Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires.
[2234.06 --> 2237.86]  But those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.
[2238.64 --> 2240.84]  The mind controlled by the sinful nature is death.
[2241.54 --> 2245.00]  But the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace.
[2245.00 --> 2247.74]  The sinful mind is hostile to God.
[2247.80 --> 2250.48]  It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.
[2251.12 --> 2254.04]  Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God.
[2255.18 --> 2261.40]  You, however, are not controlled by the sinful nature, but are in the Spirit.
[2261.64 --> 2263.88]  If indeed the Spirit of God lives in you.
[2264.46 --> 2267.72]  And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ.
[2267.72 --> 2272.66]  But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin,
[2273.24 --> 2275.74]  the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.
[2276.64 --> 2280.54]  And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you,
[2281.02 --> 2288.54]  he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you.
[2289.78 --> 2292.80]  Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation.
[2292.80 --> 2296.52]  But it is not to the sinful nature to live according to it.
[2296.76 --> 2299.18]  For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die.
[2299.58 --> 2305.48]  But if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.
[2305.82 --> 2307.06]  This is God's Word.
[2307.06 --> 2318.30]  Well, this week I was listening to a story about a missionary in China who encountered and got to know a Chinese scholar.
[2319.20 --> 2321.34]  And this scholar was very curious about religion.
[2321.46 --> 2324.44]  Not a Christian himself had read widely about Eastern religions.
[2325.06 --> 2329.22]  And in conversation, the scholar said, you know, I will read the New Testament and we'll talk about it.
[2329.24 --> 2332.14]  And so the missionary gave this guy a New Testament.
[2332.44 --> 2334.96]  He read through it and the two of them sat down to talk it through.
[2334.96 --> 2340.76]  The missionary prepared for a conversation around Jesus, his life, his death, his resurrection.
[2341.56 --> 2345.46]  But what the scholar wanted to talk about actually was one little verse in the book of Ephesians.
[2346.16 --> 2351.72]  And the verse was, it's about the temple of God being God's people and how God lives in that temple by his Spirit.
[2352.40 --> 2355.56]  And the question the scholar came to the conversation with was simple.
[2355.92 --> 2364.60]  He said, do you Christians believe that God actually dwells inside people?
[2365.44 --> 2370.52]  That God somehow like lives inside humans?
[2370.52 --> 2375.46]  And the missionary said, yeah, that's the work of the Holy Spirit.
[2375.64 --> 2376.48]  That's what we believe.
[2376.60 --> 2381.22]  And the scholar was so intrigued by this idea of God dwelling in humans.
[2381.34 --> 2391.04]  And so the conversation focused mostly on the way in which the Spirit of the living God lives and dwells and moves and changes humans.
[2391.04 --> 2399.30]  And throughout the sermon series, we've been touching on this, how there's something profound and life-changing about coming to faith in Jesus.
[2399.80 --> 2403.28]  And knowing that coming to faith in Jesus means the Spirit is at work in you.
[2404.30 --> 2407.20]  And Romans 8 basically has three main points, if I could summarize it.
[2407.24 --> 2410.52]  Number one, by faith in Jesus, you're adopted into God's family.
[2411.08 --> 2414.54]  Number two, you've been forgiven and set free through the finished work on the cross.
[2414.54 --> 2420.32]  And number three, you have God dwelling in you by the Spirit.
[2421.14 --> 2426.00]  And we're going to focus on what that means and how good news that is for us.
[2427.12 --> 2429.56]  Now, I'm going to focus right on the middle section.
[2429.72 --> 2430.86]  Romans 8 is packed.
[2430.96 --> 2434.54]  In fact, one writer said that hundreds of sermons have been written on every verse.
[2434.62 --> 2437.06]  And I'm going to have one more sermon to the pile this morning.
[2437.06 --> 2439.66]  But I'm going to focus on verses 5 to 8.
[2440.32 --> 2445.00]  Now, you should know that in verse 5 to 8, Paul makes a really sweeping statement.
[2445.50 --> 2448.30]  He basically says, you know, you've heard this phrase, there's two kinds of people in the world.
[2448.36 --> 2449.28]  Have you heard that phrase before?
[2449.72 --> 2452.68]  And it's like you've got cat people and not cat people, right?
[2452.76 --> 2454.38]  You've got morning people and not morning people.
[2454.96 --> 2455.72]  And so on it goes.
[2455.84 --> 2460.66]  Paul makes a very strong, bold statement saying there are, in fact, two kinds of people in the world.
[2460.74 --> 2465.36]  Those who are filled and led by the Spirit and those who are controlled and led by the flesh.
[2465.36 --> 2466.26]  Listen to what he says.
[2466.26 --> 2467.42]  Verse 5 and following.
[2467.42 --> 2474.02]  Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires.
[2474.92 --> 2479.58]  But those who live according to the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.
[2480.34 --> 2482.16]  The mind governed by the flesh is death.
[2482.60 --> 2485.28]  The mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace.
[2486.04 --> 2488.30]  The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God.
[2488.40 --> 2491.36]  It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.
[2491.98 --> 2494.60]  Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.
[2494.60 --> 2497.24]  Those are strong words, don't you think?
[2498.08 --> 2499.86]  Paul's basically saying you've got two options.
[2500.40 --> 2504.50]  The way of the flesh, which leads to death, or the way of the Spirit, which leads to life and peace.
[2504.84 --> 2508.36]  Which road are you on, is Paul's way of speaking here.
[2508.80 --> 2513.88]  And I'm going to highlight now the crescendo, the good news, you might say, of what Paul says next.
[2513.88 --> 2533.66]  Right after these verses, he says, you, however, are not controlled by the sinful nature, but are in the Spirit.
[2533.66 --> 2537.54]  And that last line there, he's not calling into question whether the Spirit lives in believers.
[2538.00 --> 2542.26]  He's basically saying, if you believe in Jesus, the Spirit has brought you to that place of faith.
[2542.50 --> 2551.46]  If you call Jesus Lord and want to follow Him, that's evidence of the Spirit of Christ moving, shaping, changing desires, making you a child of God.
[2552.20 --> 2553.24]  He's not calling into question.
[2553.48 --> 2557.54]  He's reinforcing the point that if you have Jesus, you have Jesus' Spirit.
[2557.54 --> 2564.38]  Now, one of the things that we're celebrating is that you three young women want to follow Jesus.
[2564.66 --> 2567.74]  And I just want to pause and celebrate, that means you have the Spirit.
[2568.28 --> 2572.68]  And what we're about to look at in these verses is very personal and it's very important for the rest of your lives.
[2574.18 --> 2577.38]  We want to unpack what it means to live in the Spirit.
[2577.44 --> 2581.92]  In fact, it's worth to ask the question, Paul's talking so powerfully about what is possible in the Spirit.
[2582.20 --> 2583.76]  What exactly is possible?
[2584.20 --> 2585.28]  What does he say in these verses?
[2585.36 --> 2586.26]  Let me look at it with you.
[2586.26 --> 2590.66]  First, he says in verse 11, this is now what's possible because of the Spirit.
[2590.80 --> 2603.30]  If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of His Spirit who lives in you.
[2605.32 --> 2606.38]  That's quite a verse.
[2606.54 --> 2608.12]  It's worth pausing and saying, do we believe that?
[2608.24 --> 2614.80]  That the same Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead is alive and at work in us.
[2614.80 --> 2619.08]  And the Spirit makes what's possible for Jesus possible for Christians.
[2619.20 --> 2621.40]  And what that means here is resurrection.
[2621.40 --> 2625.46]  Now, the three of you are young and healthy.
[2625.56 --> 2627.44]  You've got your whole life stretched out before you.
[2627.50 --> 2628.28]  We hope and pray.
[2628.64 --> 2631.28]  And you're probably not thinking a lot about dying and death, are you?
[2631.80 --> 2632.08]  No?
[2632.26 --> 2633.16]  You're allowed to say you are.
[2633.16 --> 2644.66]  But I'm told, and I've already begun to experience this, that the older you get and as you lose some of your health, your strength, all the vitality of youth, you start to think a little bit more about the years you have left.
[2645.12 --> 2646.90]  And what's coming after those years.
[2646.90 --> 2660.92]  And as those of us who are older relinquish capacities, relinquish strength, let go of things we used to be able to do but can no longer do, you start reflecting on how good the news is that death is not the end.
[2660.92 --> 2668.66]  Or as one Christian writer, Amos Traver, puts it, for the believer in Jesus Christ, death is a comma, not a period.
[2669.80 --> 2676.96]  The end for us is resurrected life and renewed bodies in a renewed creation forever because of the finished work of Jesus.
[2677.26 --> 2683.02]  And this spirit of the living God that makes what's possible in Jesus' resurrection possible for us.
[2683.12 --> 2683.64]  Praise the Lord.
[2683.64 --> 2683.68]  Praise the Lord.
[2684.88 --> 2689.02]  But for Paul, that resurrection life is not just a future reality that we wait for.
[2689.10 --> 2690.10]  It breaks into the present.
[2690.36 --> 2692.30]  Listen to what he says in verse 13.
[2693.34 --> 2693.68]  We read,
[2693.86 --> 2696.54]  For if you live according to the flesh, you'll die.
[2697.24 --> 2703.28]  But if by the spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.
[2703.92 --> 2706.10]  Now, we're touching on something really important here.
[2706.88 --> 2713.02]  The spirit, as we receive him, and as he begins to work in our lives, he starts to unsettle things.
[2713.02 --> 2718.62]  He starts to kick around the furniture of our lives, you might say, so that we change in the way of Jesus.
[2719.08 --> 2728.30]  The spirit, if I can put it more pointedly, draws us into battle against the old habits, the old desires, the old destructive tendencies that once ruled our lives.
[2728.60 --> 2731.36]  Now we put those away by the spirit's power and we change.
[2732.26 --> 2739.20]  Or to say it a different way, the spirit is in the business of making us uncomfortable so that we grow to be like Jesus.
[2740.16 --> 2741.90]  Yes, the spirit brings us the love of God.
[2741.98 --> 2745.02]  It reminds us of the goodness of Jesus, the grace we've received.
[2745.02 --> 2750.42]  But the spirit will draw us in to battling the old self that needs to be put away with.
[2750.90 --> 2752.66]  Romans talks a lot about this.
[2753.10 --> 2756.84]  And one of the great gifts, we don't talk enough about this, that the spirit does.
[2756.90 --> 2758.00]  You know one of the great gifts of the spirit?
[2758.82 --> 2760.36]  Is the conviction of sin.
[2760.36 --> 2763.28]  You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
[2764.32 --> 2765.98]  It comes in a myriad of ways.
[2766.10 --> 2767.78]  It comes through the reading of scripture.
[2767.98 --> 2768.76]  It comes through preaching.
[2769.22 --> 2773.08]  It comes through conversations with parents and grandparents and teachers and family members.
[2773.08 --> 2782.04]  It comes in all sorts of ways as you're laying in bed at night, staring at the ceiling, thinking back over your day, where all of a sudden you're like, that needs to change.
[2783.52 --> 2787.24]  The way I spoke to that person dishonored them and it dishonored God.
[2787.88 --> 2791.52]  The way I wasted this day away on screens is not how God designed me to live.
[2791.54 --> 2793.02]  And there's that pulling of the spirit.
[2793.10 --> 2793.80]  And it's very subtle.
[2793.94 --> 2794.48]  It's very gentle.
[2794.62 --> 2795.98]  God is so generous with us.
[2795.98 --> 2805.44]  I mean, if you want to think about something that's overwhelming, is imagine God made you see all the sin, all the brokenness, all the distortion of your life, all at once.
[2806.20 --> 2810.82]  But he so generously, so kindly, so patiently draws it out of us by the spirit.
[2811.16 --> 2814.86]  Season after season, year after year, idol by idol, he topples over.
[2814.98 --> 2820.76]  And as it turns out, there's different idols, different temptations, different glittering vices that come in different seasons.
[2820.86 --> 2825.58]  And the spirit of God just gently comes in and says, this has to go.
[2826.34 --> 2830.44]  And I'm here to form you in the way of Christ.
[2831.46 --> 2835.46]  The conviction of sin is one of the greatest gifts the spirit gives us.
[2835.52 --> 2838.42]  And just to highlight, someone asked me this a few weeks ago.
[2839.12 --> 2840.30]  How do we know when it's the spirit?
[2840.44 --> 2843.64]  How do we know when it's like the voice of the accuser, the voice of Satan?
[2844.00 --> 2848.12]  And I think one of the key ways we know the difference is when it's the voice of the accuser.
[2848.12 --> 2849.34]  And that voice is real, by the way.
[2849.40 --> 2850.92]  I'm not going to go around this.
[2850.92 --> 2857.58]  That voice often brings up the sin in your life, reminds you of the things you've done in your life, so that you have fear and shame and self-loathing.
[2857.84 --> 2859.74]  The spirit of God is about freedom.
[2860.50 --> 2863.52]  And when the spirit of God is at work in our lives, it draws us into repentance.
[2863.52 --> 2869.64]  It draws us into change so that we experience what this verse says is life and peace.
[2871.04 --> 2872.62]  That's the gift of the spirit.
[2873.20 --> 2876.02]  And when you feel that conviction, allow it to settle.
[2876.46 --> 2877.76]  Allow it to draw us to Jesus.
[2877.98 --> 2879.68]  Allow it to bring us into prayer.
[2879.98 --> 2881.24]  Because that is a gift.
[2881.24 --> 2887.16]  To be sensitized to the old self so that it can be put away with is a great gift.
[2888.00 --> 2889.30]  The spirit moves in us.
[2889.68 --> 2890.90]  The spirit prompts us.
[2891.16 --> 2893.56]  The spirit convicts us so that we become more like Jesus.
[2893.70 --> 2895.18]  Praise the Lord for that.
[2896.72 --> 2898.30]  But now I want to draw out something.
[2898.42 --> 2900.40]  And this is, maybe you think, a strange turn.
[2900.88 --> 2903.08]  But I've been wrestling with this since we started this series.
[2903.18 --> 2906.64]  We started this series by saying, God comes where he is welcome.
[2906.84 --> 2908.22]  The spirit moves where he is welcome.
[2908.22 --> 2912.42]  A few weeks ago when Josiah was preaching, he made this comment that just unsettled me.
[2912.50 --> 2913.22]  But it's true.
[2913.38 --> 2916.04]  He said, the spirit doesn't overpower the human will.
[2916.46 --> 2918.32]  It doesn't just trample our own desires.
[2918.56 --> 2922.02]  If we want distance from God, there's a sense in which the spirit honors that.
[2922.24 --> 2923.94]  And here's the scripture behind that statement.
[2924.88 --> 2930.00]  In Acts chapter 7, Stephen, who's being killed for his faith, he says to the religious leaders,
[2930.16 --> 2931.96]  do not resist the spirit.
[2932.66 --> 2937.18]  Ephesians chapter 4, Paul's speaking to a church where there's slander, gossip, all sorts of division.
[2937.18 --> 2940.76]  He says, don't grieve the Holy Spirit by higher living.
[2941.36 --> 2945.90]  1 Thessalonians 5, Paul's speaking to a church that's questioning the gifts of the spirit.
[2946.12 --> 2948.44]  And he says, do not quench the spirit.
[2949.28 --> 2955.86]  So that is to say, these are words to believers in the church that we can grieve and resist and quench the spirit.
[2956.82 --> 2961.68]  There's a sense in which believers who have the spirit can turn the volume down, you might say,
[2961.68 --> 2965.04]  on the voice and the prompting of the spirit.
[2966.18 --> 2967.56]  And we need to hear that warning.
[2968.52 --> 2973.26]  And maybe just to bring it a little closer to home, I think, you know, as a pastor and a leader in the church,
[2973.56 --> 2977.48]  I can be so moved as I read the book of Acts in particular
[2977.48 --> 2983.56]  and get a glimpse of what life and what church can look like when moved and motivated and transformed by the spirit.
[2983.56 --> 2988.92]  And then you look at your own life and you look at your church and you think, man, like, how do we get that?
[2988.96 --> 2991.44]  Because there's a sense in which I'm just like, I'll turn that volume down.
[2992.10 --> 2996.22]  Or we can so easily say, you know, I want Jesus, but I want him at a comfortable distance.
[2996.76 --> 3003.12]  I want the spirit to prompt me, but at my terms, at my timing, when I feel like it's convenient.
[3003.12 --> 3007.84]  And we live these lives in one way or another where we are resisting the voice of the spirit.
[3007.94 --> 3011.78]  And here's why I want to exhort the three of you who've given your profession of faith
[3011.78 --> 3018.38]  to be attentive to the voice of God, to carve out the time.
[3018.48 --> 3021.96]  I think one of the great temptations we have is not someone who's like, hey, renounce your faith.
[3022.20 --> 3024.46]  It's living in a culture that says, why don't you live at a pace?
[3025.12 --> 3031.46]  Why don't you be so busy you will not be able to discern the prompting of the spirit, the voice of God, the love of Jesus?
[3031.46 --> 3037.96]  Why don't you move so fast from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. or earlier and later with all the things of this world,
[3038.30 --> 3044.98]  with the good things of life, so that you're so busy you cannot slow down to hear God speak.
[3045.68 --> 3050.18]  And I have to say, I appreciate in your testimonies that sense of like, over the last few years,
[3050.72 --> 3054.94]  disciplines coming into your life, starting your day a certain way, finishing your day a certain way,
[3055.28 --> 3059.06]  recognizing that for us to hear God speak, and this is a big part of my own story,
[3059.06 --> 3062.70]  required slowing down.
[3064.30 --> 3067.74]  Slowing down, stilling one's body, putting away the screens,
[3067.86 --> 3070.24]  so that you can be in conversation with your Heavenly Father.
[3070.60 --> 3074.00]  You can hear the spirit who is alive and at work in your life and say, yes,
[3074.34 --> 3075.62]  this is where I want to move.
[3075.90 --> 3078.48]  This is who I want to be, and I'm willing to say no to this.
[3078.94 --> 3079.90]  Put the screens away.
[3080.24 --> 3083.18]  Say no to this commitment, so that I can be in a living,
[3083.68 --> 3084.78]  life-giving relationship
[3084.78 --> 3086.44]  with my Heavenly Father.
[3087.14 --> 3089.60]  So I exhort the three of you, and all of us,
[3090.38 --> 3093.26]  to carve out the time to be attentive to Jesus.
[3094.66 --> 3097.00]  I shared this in the 9 a.m. service, and I was regretting it,
[3097.04 --> 3099.44]  but I'm going to say it again, because I think it's a punchy story.
[3099.54 --> 3100.02]  It's convicting.
[3100.70 --> 3102.34]  But there's an author I quite love,
[3102.42 --> 3104.20]  who talks a lot about spiritual disciplines.
[3105.10 --> 3107.56]  Talked about the practice of giving, of silence, of solitude,
[3107.72 --> 3109.76]  reading the scriptures, prayer, communally and individually.
[3110.34 --> 3111.58]  And he had someone come up to him
[3111.58 --> 3113.22]  after he was sharing about these practices.
[3113.46 --> 3115.14]  And the guy's like, how can I do these things?
[3115.18 --> 3115.86]  I'm so busy.
[3115.94 --> 3117.08]  I have so many things going on.
[3117.34 --> 3118.96]  And he basically said, like, I love what you're saying,
[3119.02 --> 3120.44]  but I'm not going to do these practices.
[3120.86 --> 3122.60]  And the pastor quickly said to him,
[3123.04 --> 3124.90]  maybe you're too busy to follow Jesus.
[3126.16 --> 3127.96]  Maybe this isn't what you actually want.
[3128.60 --> 3129.96]  Maybe you're not really in the place
[3129.96 --> 3131.10]  where you're ready for apprenticeship,
[3131.10 --> 3133.04]  because that requires slowing down
[3133.04 --> 3136.14]  and giving attention and priority to a relationship
[3136.14 --> 3138.18]  that will change our lives forever.
[3140.68 --> 3143.64]  But let me finish not with challenge,
[3144.10 --> 3145.48]  but with encouragement.
[3145.68 --> 3148.24]  Romans 8, after all, is all about encouragement.
[3148.36 --> 3148.88]  You know why?
[3150.02 --> 3150.88]  Receive this.
[3151.22 --> 3154.06]  The Spirit of God that dwells in our midst
[3154.06 --> 3156.66]  is more powerful than the flesh.
[3157.96 --> 3160.72]  And that means Jesus changes us
[3160.72 --> 3164.10]  in such a way that new possibilities emerge by the Spirit.
[3164.84 --> 3167.06]  The power that raised Jesus from the dead
[3167.06 --> 3169.54]  is at work putting to death in us,
[3169.76 --> 3171.60]  with us, the old self,
[3171.68 --> 3173.44]  so that the three of you and all of us
[3173.44 --> 3174.78]  can experience more freedom,
[3175.56 --> 3176.34]  more peace,
[3176.88 --> 3180.86]  more life in and through the work of the Spirit.
[3180.98 --> 3181.92]  Praise the Lord for that.
[3182.68 --> 3183.74]  And Romans 8 doesn't say,
[3183.84 --> 3185.14]  hey, if you get these things in order,
[3185.34 --> 3186.42]  if you do the work,
[3186.48 --> 3187.46]  then you're going to experience it.
[3187.46 --> 3190.20]  It says, no, you've already been brought into God's family.
[3190.62 --> 3193.30]  The work of Jesus has already covered over your faith
[3193.30 --> 3193.88]  and your life.
[3193.88 --> 3195.90]  There's no condemnation and no judgment.
[3196.24 --> 3197.84]  And now you have the Spirit to work out
[3197.84 --> 3199.86]  for the rest of your lives
[3199.86 --> 3202.92]  the freedom you already have secured in Christ.
[3203.94 --> 3204.76]  That's Romans 8.
[3205.62 --> 3206.92]  And to the three of you, I say,
[3207.50 --> 3208.90]  receive the gift of the Spirit.
[3210.32 --> 3211.82]  Allow for the rest of your lives
[3211.82 --> 3213.56]  the Spirit to draw you into loving,
[3213.80 --> 3215.52]  meaningful relationship with Jesus Christ,
[3215.94 --> 3217.52]  who is who He says He is.
[3218.34 --> 3219.72]  The life is truly life.
[3219.72 --> 3222.16]  And the same Spirit
[3222.16 --> 3225.04]  that rose Jesus Christ from the dead
[3225.04 --> 3227.18]  is ours to experience.
[3227.88 --> 3229.34]  Would you let me lead us in prayer?
[3234.34 --> 3235.54]  Father, we praise You
[3235.54 --> 3237.70]  for making us Your children.
[3239.06 --> 3241.56]  We praise You for melting our rebellious hearts
[3241.56 --> 3242.72]  in one way or another
[3242.72 --> 3244.30]  so that we can be part of Your church.
[3244.30 --> 3247.08]  We praise You for all the people
[3247.08 --> 3248.46]  that You put in our lives
[3248.46 --> 3250.46]  to bring us to a place of faith.
[3251.56 --> 3253.16]  We praise You for the prayers
[3253.16 --> 3254.84]  prayed on our behalf
[3254.84 --> 3257.46]  so that we would know the grace of Christ.
[3257.56 --> 3258.64]  You are so good.
[3259.46 --> 3260.54]  You are so patient.
[3261.24 --> 3262.36]  You are so gentle.
[3263.44 --> 3264.12]  And we ask, Lord,
[3264.16 --> 3265.76]  that You give us more and more
[3265.76 --> 3267.52]  a hunger for freedom
[3267.52 --> 3269.40]  that comes through the work of the Spirit.
[3269.98 --> 3271.54]  Allow us to receive the conviction.
[3272.28 --> 3273.94]  Allow us to respond to the prompting
[3273.94 --> 3275.28]  so that we would put to death
[3275.28 --> 3276.36]  the misdeeds of the body
[3276.36 --> 3277.68]  and experience the freedom
[3277.68 --> 3278.54]  that comes in Jesus.
[3279.16 --> 3279.98]  And to this we say,
[3280.10 --> 3280.88]  come Lord Jesus,
[3281.44 --> 3282.58]  take hold of our lives
[3282.58 --> 3284.42]  and allow us to experience blessing
[3284.42 --> 3287.16]  and share that with the world around us.
[3287.48 --> 3288.92]  We pray this in Christ's name.
[3289.48 --> 3289.72]  Amen.
[3291.14 --> 3292.80]  Would you stand and sing with me a song?
