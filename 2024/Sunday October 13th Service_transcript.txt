[0.00 --> 8.26]  In the 9 a.m. service, when we announced that there was Cornerstone and launch, there was
[8.26 --> 10.00]  a kid right behind me who says, woo-hoo!
[10.78 --> 14.56]  And I had never seen a kid so excited to leave the service to go upstairs.
[14.90 --> 18.68]  And so we praise the Lord for all the Cornerstone teachers and the excitement our kids have
[18.68 --> 19.14]  for it.
[20.52 --> 23.82]  If you're new to Hope or visiting today, I just want to say my name is Dave Gruden.
[24.20 --> 25.46]  I'm one of the pastors here.
[26.02 --> 28.82]  And I want to share just a bit about the sermon series we're in the middle of.
[28.82 --> 33.06]  For the last few weeks, we've been preaching a series called Contrast Community.
[33.82 --> 38.16]  And the focus of this series is looking at the distinctive ways the church is called to
[38.16 --> 42.60]  live that are in contrast to the normal way of life in our city.
[43.10 --> 48.52]  So we've looked at what it means to be a community of service in a culture of self-elevation, a
[48.52 --> 54.84]  community of dependent prayer in a world of self-sufficiency, a community of rest in a world
[54.84 --> 56.08]  of hurry and exhaustion.
[56.08 --> 60.52]  And this morning, we're going to be looking at what it means to be a community of gratitude
[60.52 --> 65.40]  and generosity in a world of greed and, I'd add, and entitlement.
[65.88 --> 68.74]  So that's what we're going to talk about and read about.
[68.84 --> 71.66]  And if you have your Bible, turn with me to Matthew chapter 6.
[72.28 --> 76.54]  And we're going to listen to Jesus teach us about money and treasures and possessions.
[76.54 --> 81.98]  I'm going to start in verse 19 of Matthew chapter 6.
[81.98 --> 111.96]  Matthew chapter 6.
[111.98 --> 135.88]  This is God's Word.
[135.88 --> 140.74]  Well, I want to begin with a picture.
[140.96 --> 143.70]  It's actually a comic that I saw not that long ago.
[144.14 --> 146.70]  And I'll say just a few words about it once you see it.
[148.44 --> 152.50]  So this is an artist's depiction of a young man living his life.
[152.60 --> 156.12]  And you can see at the beginning, probably starting his career, what is he doing?
[156.18 --> 157.30]  He's chasing after money.
[158.00 --> 159.22]  And then you'll see he's middle-aged.
[159.28 --> 160.18]  He's lost a bit of hair.
[160.24 --> 161.24]  He's got some money now.
[161.28 --> 161.88]  He's holding it.
[161.88 --> 163.18]  But he's still chasing after money.
[163.26 --> 164.22]  And then what's the third frame?
[165.10 --> 165.74]  Game over.
[166.06 --> 166.64]  Life's over.
[166.74 --> 168.58]  And there you are, holding your money.
[169.18 --> 176.38]  And I think the artist who made this comic communicates what he's trying to say in the face of that man in the third frame.
[176.44 --> 177.08]  What do you see there?
[177.66 --> 179.22]  What emotions do you think he's depicting?
[179.22 --> 180.22]  Sadness?
[181.44 --> 181.88]  Sadness?
[183.18 --> 184.64]  Maybe even a sense of guilt?
[185.78 --> 186.22]  Regret?
[186.84 --> 194.34]  I think that face captures maybe what many people feel at the end of their lives when they realize what they've been chasing will fail them.
[194.86 --> 197.64]  And they cannot take it with them.
[198.46 --> 200.82]  I have an uncle who has repeated this phrase many times.
[200.92 --> 201.44]  It's in my head.
[201.50 --> 205.50]  But he says, you will never see a hearse towing a U-Haul trailer.
[206.30 --> 206.90]  Do you get that?
[206.90 --> 211.80]  A hearse is what the vehicle that takes a body and a casket away to a cemetery.
[212.06 --> 214.16]  You'll never see that vehicle towing a U-Haul.
[214.54 --> 216.14]  You cannot take your stuff with you.
[216.26 --> 217.76]  You cannot take your money with you.
[218.06 --> 223.20]  And what Jesus is saying, not only are these things impermanent, but they are terrible masters.
[224.06 --> 226.06]  They are terrible idols to worship.
[226.20 --> 228.50]  They will always fail us.
[228.50 --> 232.76]  Now, this teaching comes to us from the Sermon on the Mount.
[232.98 --> 235.66]  And there's many challenging teachings in the Sermon on the Mount.
[236.06 --> 241.06]  But some have said this might be the hardest hitting for North American and Canadian people.
[241.14 --> 246.32]  Not because of what Jesus says so much as where we are as we listen in our context.
[246.32 --> 261.08]  I don't think I need to convince anyone that we live in a consumer society where it is normal to organize your life around the chasing of money and all that it gets you with technology and travel and toys.
[261.38 --> 264.72]  That is a normal reason for living in North America.
[264.72 --> 267.62]  It's sort of an acceptable way of organizing your life.
[268.64 --> 272.84]  And to bring it one more level, I'd say many of us Christians, we swim well in these waters.
[273.76 --> 273.94]  Right?
[274.18 --> 278.84]  We have one foot in this sort of Canadian dream of making money and having all the luxuries of life.
[278.98 --> 281.68]  And then this other foot that's trying to figure out what it means to follow Jesus.
[282.12 --> 287.40]  And Jesus, I think, speaks very boldly and plainly in this passage.
[287.50 --> 287.70]  Right?
[288.38 --> 292.58]  He says what you treasure, what you value most deeply, that's where your heart really is.
[292.86 --> 294.30]  That's where the worship really happens.
[294.72 --> 296.62]  He says you can't serve two masters.
[296.84 --> 297.72]  It's only one.
[297.78 --> 299.28]  So it's God or it's money.
[299.36 --> 300.18]  But it's not both.
[300.58 --> 302.44]  It must be God or money.
[303.06 --> 308.06]  And I think Jesus wants to create in every listener to this sermon a tension.
[309.58 --> 313.98]  A tension that says, okay, for you and me, we live in a very consumeristic society.
[314.14 --> 317.28]  We live in a society where people are chasing after money like that comic.
[317.64 --> 319.78]  And Jesus says, I invite you to discipleship.
[320.34 --> 321.76]  To follow after me.
[321.76 --> 327.88]  And that is a lifestyle of simplicity, of gratitude, and of generosity.
[328.04 --> 329.22]  And we're going to work that out this morning.
[329.94 --> 334.96]  But before we dive into the passage, I want to read one writer's summary of Jesus himself.
[335.42 --> 336.42]  And let me just say this.
[336.46 --> 340.74]  We've been saying over the last number of months that we believe discipleship, that is following Jesus,
[341.26 --> 345.30]  is being with Jesus, becoming like Jesus, and doing what Jesus did.
[345.30 --> 348.30]  So let's listen to how Jesus lived his life for a moment here.
[348.86 --> 350.74]  This comes from a writer named Scott McKnight.
[352.18 --> 354.30]  Jesus lived on little.
[355.52 --> 357.46]  He lived from the generosity of others.
[358.40 --> 360.70]  He undoubtedly knew some hunger and thirst.
[361.52 --> 365.26]  He knew what it was to have little and to dwell with those who had even less,
[365.66 --> 369.92]  while others around him basked in luxury and filled their mouths with delicacies.
[369.92 --> 375.38]  He embodied a carefree, trust-in-God kind of economic vision.
[375.62 --> 378.12]  He demanded simplicity because he lived it.
[378.70 --> 382.00]  He expected care for the poor because he had experienced it.
[382.66 --> 386.16]  And so the question that sort of rings in my ears after reading this is,
[386.62 --> 392.10]  do we share Jesus' carefree, trust-in-God vision for our lives?
[392.20 --> 394.36]  Do we live simply and care for the poor?
[394.36 --> 398.38]  Because Jesus himself modeled and then embodied this kind of life.
[400.86 --> 405.16]  And it is this Jesus who now says these words at the beginning of our passage,
[405.24 --> 406.06]  and I'll read it again.
[407.56 --> 408.70]  He says to us,
[408.70 --> 432.14]  And I'd be remiss not to point out that the people who got angry after this teaching in Luke's gospel
[432.14 --> 433.50]  are the Pharisees.
[433.58 --> 436.04]  It's actually the religious leaders that Jesus is going after
[436.04 --> 439.26]  because they are the wealthy people who are unconcerned for the poor
[439.26 --> 441.44]  and not seeing the needs of people around them.
[442.28 --> 443.82]  But there's a lot in this passage, right?
[444.18 --> 446.18]  And the first thing Jesus is going after here
[446.18 --> 450.64]  is the impermanence of our earthly possessions and our stuff and our money,
[451.14 --> 453.08]  that they do not last forever, right?
[453.66 --> 457.42]  And he talks about moths and rust and thieves stealing stuff.
[458.00 --> 461.06]  And I'm intrigued by how those were, you know, the rot and theft,
[461.16 --> 462.90]  those are issues people really had to worry about then,
[463.00 --> 465.04]  and we still worry about them now, don't we?
[465.04 --> 468.16]  We still are worried about our stuff getting old.
[468.38 --> 470.00]  We're still worried about our stuff getting stolen.
[470.16 --> 472.86]  In fact, is anyone here on the Clayton Heights Facebook page?
[474.24 --> 475.70]  Oh, you're better off for not being on it.
[475.74 --> 476.60]  It's a den of conflict.
[476.72 --> 477.68]  You probably know this.
[478.28 --> 479.84]  But if you're on that Facebook page,
[480.14 --> 483.06]  half the posts are just people's Amazon packages getting stolen
[483.06 --> 483.66]  and people saying,
[483.76 --> 484.84]  Does anyone know who this is?
[485.16 --> 486.86]  And I'm like, yes, we still deal with theft,
[487.00 --> 488.10]  even here in Clayton Heights.
[488.76 --> 490.18]  But what Jesus is saying is,
[490.24 --> 492.30]  your stuff's not going to last, right?
[492.30 --> 493.64]  And I'll just highlight this.
[493.72 --> 496.18]  Even though we have our money in these financial institutions,
[496.34 --> 498.60]  it experiences all the turbulence of the markets.
[498.70 --> 500.76]  It goes up and it goes down.
[500.88 --> 502.00]  We gain and we lose,
[502.22 --> 504.18]  especially if you have Bitcoin, right?
[505.32 --> 507.06]  Our houses get old.
[507.90 --> 509.74]  Our clothes wear out and need to be replaced.
[509.86 --> 512.60]  Our technology is designed to not last long.
[512.82 --> 514.10]  We have to keep getting new things.
[514.18 --> 515.02]  And let me say this.
[515.30 --> 518.10]  That car or truck that you really love,
[518.18 --> 518.80]  maybe you have it,
[518.80 --> 520.26]  maybe you envy others who do,
[520.64 --> 522.12]  it will end up in a junkyard.
[522.62 --> 524.26]  And your kids and grandkids will mock you
[524.26 --> 525.24]  for thinking it looked good.
[525.62 --> 527.44]  It's going to happen if it hasn't already.
[528.00 --> 529.12]  And the point of this is,
[529.18 --> 529.62]  Jesus is saying,
[529.72 --> 531.88]  your stuff is not going to last forever.
[532.06 --> 534.24]  So don't place all your hope in it.
[534.68 --> 536.06]  Don't let that be your master.
[536.16 --> 539.14]  It's going to fail you over and over and over again.
[539.30 --> 539.74]  And friends,
[539.94 --> 542.54]  we live in a society where people continually try
[542.54 --> 543.76]  to find their meaning,
[544.08 --> 544.60]  their purpose,
[544.78 --> 545.68]  and their satisfaction
[545.68 --> 548.40]  in stuff that can't give it.
[549.44 --> 550.36]  And there are many people
[550.36 --> 551.64]  who will come to the end of their life,
[551.72 --> 552.94]  just like the fellow in that comic,
[553.20 --> 554.98]  and wish they had done it all differently
[554.98 --> 556.84]  because their idols will fail them.
[557.10 --> 558.46]  And their idols, more pointedly,
[558.50 --> 560.06]  will not bring them up from the grave.
[561.82 --> 563.08]  And what Jesus is saying here,
[563.16 --> 564.72]  very important detail to emphasize,
[564.94 --> 566.58]  is not that our possessions are evil
[566.58 --> 567.74]  or that money is bad.
[568.28 --> 569.40]  That's not what Jesus teaches.
[569.54 --> 571.20]  It does lead to all sorts of evil,
[571.42 --> 572.64]  but it itself is not evil.
[572.64 --> 576.00]  God is a generous God who gives good gifts for us to enjoy.
[576.58 --> 579.46]  But these gifts so quickly become our slave owners,
[580.08 --> 582.32]  and we become enslaved to them.
[582.72 --> 584.24]  And that's the real threat.
[585.04 --> 588.02]  And I used to think that greed was an issue
[588.02 --> 589.30]  for some people over there.
[589.60 --> 590.46]  The older I get,
[590.52 --> 592.38]  the more I realize that greed is an issue for all of us,
[592.44 --> 595.10]  especially in a consumer society, right?
[595.36 --> 596.64]  Where at any stage,
[596.70 --> 598.08]  there's going to be things you want,
[598.18 --> 599.08]  money you want,
[599.36 --> 600.22]  things you want to buy,
[600.36 --> 601.40]  housing you want to afford,
[601.40 --> 603.30]  and you're always chasing for more.
[603.50 --> 605.92]  And that hunger is deep within our sinful condition
[605.92 --> 607.50]  to want more of stuff,
[607.86 --> 609.82]  more money to fund a certain lifestyle,
[610.14 --> 612.00]  more and more and more.
[612.80 --> 613.84]  And Jesus invites us
[613.84 --> 616.80]  into a totally different way of being.
[617.98 --> 619.30]  And his way of saying it,
[619.66 --> 621.26]  in contrast to storing up for ourselves
[621.26 --> 622.40]  treasures on earth is,
[622.78 --> 624.68]  to store up treasures for ourself in heaven.
[625.76 --> 626.54]  And I don't know about you,
[626.62 --> 628.10]  but that is a strange phrase.
[628.10 --> 630.10]  Like when you think of that even,
[630.32 --> 632.46]  how do you imagine doing that, right?
[632.62 --> 634.44]  How do you store up for yourself
[634.44 --> 636.36]  treasures in heaven?
[638.42 --> 640.08]  Now, you won't be surprised maybe to hear
[640.08 --> 641.20]  that there's different ways
[641.20 --> 642.68]  that people interpret that phrase.
[643.42 --> 645.14]  And I happen to like more than one of them.
[645.24 --> 646.76]  One is to live in a way
[646.76 --> 648.20]  that reflects eternity, right?
[648.28 --> 649.62]  You live with character,
[649.82 --> 650.60]  you develop relationships,
[650.74 --> 651.64]  and you live in a way of,
[651.76 --> 653.36]  you invest in the things that will last.
[653.90 --> 654.96]  But I like this way,
[655.02 --> 656.80]  this comes from a fellow named N.T. Wright.
[656.80 --> 658.98]  He says, Jesus talks about heaven
[658.98 --> 660.78]  as the kingdom of heaven.
[661.38 --> 663.20]  In fact, that's a phrase he repeats a lot
[663.20 --> 664.16]  in the Gospel of Matthew.
[664.66 --> 666.28]  And for Jesus, the kingdom of heaven
[666.28 --> 667.86]  is this coming rule
[667.86 --> 670.10]  that will come when he returns in glory.
[670.42 --> 671.00]  And it's his kingdom
[671.00 --> 672.60]  that will fill the earth of peace,
[672.98 --> 675.04]  of justice, of care for the poor.
[675.20 --> 676.60]  There will be no more warfare,
[676.74 --> 678.58]  no more division between the wealthy and the poor.
[679.00 --> 680.78]  All the needs of the world will be met
[680.78 --> 681.96]  when Jesus' kingdom comes.
[682.30 --> 683.76]  And the church, then,
[684.32 --> 685.82]  is the community that sees
[685.82 --> 687.50]  and catches a glimpse of that future
[687.50 --> 689.56]  because of what Jesus is doing in the church
[689.56 --> 691.46]  and begins to live now
[691.46 --> 693.76]  what will one day be normal for the whole earth.
[694.86 --> 696.38]  Or my father-in-law,
[696.48 --> 697.52]  who's written on the story of the Bible,
[697.60 --> 699.58]  he says, the church is sort of the sneak preview
[699.58 --> 701.80]  in a movie of the future.
[701.98 --> 703.66]  You know, when you go to see sneak previews
[703.66 --> 704.48]  at a movie theater,
[704.54 --> 705.84]  it gives you a glimpse of what's coming.
[705.92 --> 707.18]  The church is the glimpse
[707.18 --> 708.86]  of the way the world is gonna be
[708.86 --> 710.20]  when Jesus returns in glory.
[710.76 --> 712.12]  And if you read the book of Acts
[712.12 --> 714.48]  and you pay attention to how the church is living,
[714.58 --> 716.80]  you'll see that they are caring for the poor
[716.80 --> 718.64]  because they know that in God's future,
[718.70 --> 719.64]  the poor will be cared for.
[719.98 --> 721.02]  They are giving generously
[721.02 --> 721.92]  because they know in the future
[721.92 --> 722.74]  there will be generosity.
[723.28 --> 724.84]  They are living in just ways
[724.84 --> 727.04]  and caring in all sorts of amazing ways
[727.04 --> 728.94]  because they know that day is coming
[728.94 --> 729.82]  when Christ returns.
[730.52 --> 733.96]  They are storing up treasures for heaven.
[735.66 --> 737.02]  And for the rest of our time here,
[737.06 --> 738.10]  I'm actually gonna focus on
[738.10 --> 739.96]  how we do that practically.
[739.96 --> 742.52]  And I'm trying to keep myself on time here
[742.52 --> 743.76]  because we're gonna take a little more time
[743.76 --> 744.84]  with communion this morning.
[745.56 --> 746.54]  But I wanna open up,
[746.60 --> 748.10]  what are the practical ways
[748.10 --> 750.36]  that we store up for ourselves
[750.36 --> 751.54]  treasures in heaven?
[752.24 --> 753.52]  And here are the three things
[753.52 --> 754.26]  that I'm gonna say.
[754.70 --> 757.96]  The first is practicing gratitude.
[759.18 --> 761.30]  From beginning to end,
[761.78 --> 763.88]  the Bible opens up for us
[763.88 --> 766.50]  a God who owns the whole earth.
[766.50 --> 768.62]  He owns our countries,
[768.90 --> 769.42]  our cities,
[769.66 --> 770.18]  our homes,
[770.32 --> 770.90]  our lives,
[771.00 --> 771.56]  our jobs,
[771.64 --> 772.76]  and our money.
[773.26 --> 774.12]  And as a result,
[774.76 --> 776.16]  believers do not need to fear
[776.16 --> 776.92]  or be anxious
[776.92 --> 778.40]  about our property or possessions
[778.40 --> 780.42]  because God gives them to us generously
[780.42 --> 781.54]  and he knows our needs
[781.54 --> 782.56]  and will take care of us.
[783.12 --> 784.12]  Isn't that a beautiful reality?
[784.80 --> 785.74]  Your neighbors don't know this,
[785.80 --> 786.20]  by the way,
[786.76 --> 787.48]  that we have a God
[787.48 --> 789.46]  who provides for us
[789.46 --> 790.78]  and who is generous
[790.78 --> 791.94]  with giving us what we need,
[792.02 --> 793.24]  often much more than we need
[793.24 --> 794.34]  so that we can care for others.
[794.34 --> 795.78]  He owns it all.
[796.44 --> 798.04]  And our response to that God
[798.04 --> 799.64]  on more than just Thanksgiving Sunday
[799.64 --> 801.24]  is gratitude.
[802.56 --> 803.00]  Thanksgiving.
[803.58 --> 804.74]  Because he knows what we need
[804.74 --> 806.00]  and he provides for us.
[806.90 --> 807.54]  And by the way,
[807.62 --> 808.46]  when you start reflecting
[808.46 --> 809.70]  on the ownership of God
[809.70 --> 810.46]  over all things,
[810.56 --> 811.62]  including your stuff,
[812.28 --> 814.00]  it changes the way you live with it.
[814.46 --> 814.64]  Right?
[815.50 --> 817.04]  I have a teacher from years ago
[817.04 --> 818.48]  and they had this practice.
[819.00 --> 819.98]  This is before the days
[819.98 --> 820.70]  of direct deposit
[820.70 --> 822.48]  when you would get a check
[822.48 --> 823.20]  from your job.
[823.28 --> 824.18]  Anyone know what I'm talking about?
[824.18 --> 825.12]  Do I need to explain this
[825.12 --> 825.98]  to our younger generation?
[826.38 --> 827.70]  A check is this little rectangle
[827.70 --> 828.64]  that had numbers on it.
[828.72 --> 829.16]  It's your pay.
[829.88 --> 830.80]  And they'd get a check
[830.80 --> 831.44]  from their employer,
[831.54 --> 831.92]  their teacher,
[832.02 --> 832.84]  and they'd take it home,
[832.96 --> 833.74]  put it on the table,
[834.14 --> 834.66]  and they would,
[834.78 --> 835.52]  every single time
[835.52 --> 836.02]  they got a check,
[836.40 --> 837.54]  thank the Lord
[837.54 --> 839.54]  for giving them a job,
[840.18 --> 841.66]  for providing for them income
[841.66 --> 842.74]  to take care of their family
[842.74 --> 843.64]  and pay their bills
[843.64 --> 844.50]  and live their life.
[844.56 --> 845.42]  It was a practice they did.
[845.50 --> 846.12]  And then they would take it
[846.12 --> 846.72]  off to the bank.
[847.12 --> 848.30]  This also for younger people.
[848.42 --> 848.92]  It's a building
[848.92 --> 849.70]  where you take money
[849.70 --> 851.74]  and you deposit that check
[851.74 --> 852.36]  to a person.
[853.26 --> 854.30]  But that was their practice.
[854.38 --> 855.00]  It's a way of saying
[855.00 --> 856.14]  this job is a gift,
[856.32 --> 857.32]  this income is a gift,
[857.38 --> 858.94]  and I want to give thanks to God
[858.94 --> 860.16]  and live with a posture
[860.16 --> 860.88]  of gratitude.
[862.04 --> 862.94]  Now, I don't have the time
[862.94 --> 864.12]  to get into this this morning,
[864.22 --> 865.06]  but I also have this
[865.06 --> 866.10]  emerging hunch,
[866.38 --> 867.22]  and that's this,
[867.72 --> 869.34]  that people who live gratefully
[869.34 --> 871.44]  will live with increasing levels
[871.44 --> 872.40]  of contentment
[872.40 --> 873.72]  and simplicity.
[874.64 --> 875.58]  Because when you're grateful,
[875.80 --> 876.80]  you're not just constantly
[876.80 --> 877.64]  hungering for more.
[877.64 --> 878.60]  You're not chasing after
[878.60 --> 879.38]  whatever technology
[879.38 --> 880.54]  your neighbors and friends have
[880.54 --> 882.28]  or just constantly aching for more
[882.28 --> 882.82]  because you know
[882.82 --> 884.04]  God will take care of you.
[884.50 --> 885.60]  And that stuff,
[885.76 --> 886.54]  that more,
[886.80 --> 888.10]  is not what's going to satisfy
[888.10 --> 889.34]  your deepest cravings,
[889.58 --> 890.44]  your deepest hungers,
[890.78 --> 891.66]  your deepest desires.
[892.06 --> 893.06]  It is Jesus Christ.
[893.68 --> 894.88]  And those who practice gratitude
[894.88 --> 896.38]  build that relationship
[896.38 --> 897.82]  and learn that trust.
[898.88 --> 900.04]  So that's the first practice,
[900.58 --> 901.44]  practicing gratitude.
[902.30 --> 903.70]  Let's open up the second one,
[903.74 --> 905.78]  which is practicing generosity.
[905.78 --> 908.54]  Those who know
[908.54 --> 909.90]  that God owns it all,
[910.62 --> 911.80]  those who live in gratitude
[911.80 --> 913.68]  for God who gives so generously,
[914.48 --> 917.14]  learn to give their stuff away.
[917.82 --> 919.92]  Learn to open-handedly share
[919.92 --> 920.98]  what God has given them.
[921.08 --> 922.14]  And in God's economy,
[922.26 --> 923.20]  in the story of the Bible,
[923.72 --> 925.52]  those who have been given more
[925.52 --> 927.66]  get the privilege
[927.66 --> 929.46]  of giving more away.
[930.42 --> 931.80]  Now, I happen to grow up
[931.80 --> 932.72]  in a community where
[932.72 --> 934.04]  there's been some incredibly
[934.04 --> 935.04]  wealthy people
[935.04 --> 936.20]  who have modeled
[936.20 --> 937.46]  incredible generosity.
[937.62 --> 938.60]  And I praise the Lord for that
[938.60 --> 939.72]  because they see
[939.72 --> 940.76]  how God's given much
[940.76 --> 942.30]  and therefore they can give much
[942.30 --> 942.96]  in return.
[943.34 --> 944.36]  They can share with those
[944.36 --> 944.74]  who are in need.
[944.78 --> 945.80]  But that's not all of us.
[946.16 --> 946.78]  For many of us,
[946.88 --> 947.74]  the practice of generosity
[947.74 --> 948.76]  is a hard practice.
[948.92 --> 950.42]  And it's one that God uses
[950.42 --> 952.36]  to break the idols of greed
[952.36 --> 953.68]  and this hunger for more.
[956.50 --> 957.42]  I want to ask some
[957.42 --> 958.80]  diagnostic questions for us.
[958.86 --> 959.98]  Can you give your money away?
[959.98 --> 962.46]  Can you tithe without
[962.46 --> 963.60]  someone resenting
[963.60 --> 964.98]  giving money away?
[965.32 --> 966.42]  Can you live open-handedly
[966.42 --> 967.26]  with your possessions?
[969.40 --> 970.92]  I shared this story
[970.92 --> 971.42]  at the 9 a.m.
[971.42 --> 972.56]  I've shared this story before,
[972.68 --> 974.04]  but it probably bears sharing again.
[975.16 --> 977.24]  My in-laws live in Phoenix
[977.24 --> 977.82]  half the year.
[977.96 --> 978.66]  Maybe you know that.
[979.08 --> 979.86]  And while they're away,
[979.96 --> 980.88]  I have this practice
[980.88 --> 982.18]  of giving their car away.
[983.02 --> 984.16]  So over the years,
[984.22 --> 984.84]  there's been different people
[984.84 --> 985.30]  and family.
[985.58 --> 986.42]  But there's one time
[986.42 --> 987.04]  where there is someone
[987.04 --> 987.82]  we got to know.
[988.10 --> 988.54]  They're a family
[988.54 --> 989.58]  that recently moved
[989.58 --> 990.30]  from Ethiopia.
[991.12 --> 992.52]  And the young man
[992.52 --> 992.98]  in the family,
[993.10 --> 993.94]  one of the students actually,
[994.00 --> 994.90]  he just got his license
[994.90 --> 995.88]  and started a new job
[995.88 --> 996.72]  and was looking for a vehicle.
[996.86 --> 997.20]  And I was like,
[997.50 --> 998.22]  you can definitely
[998.22 --> 999.24]  use my in-laws' car.
[999.80 --> 1000.44]  And I didn't ask
[1000.44 --> 1001.00]  for their permission.
[1001.14 --> 1001.60]  They're away.
[1002.10 --> 1003.18]  And that went sideways
[1003.18 --> 1003.86]  when I realized
[1003.86 --> 1005.46]  he called me in panic
[1005.46 --> 1006.36]  because he had smashed
[1006.36 --> 1007.02]  it through a fence
[1007.02 --> 1008.42]  and through someone's garage.
[1008.90 --> 1010.10]  And I still, to this day,
[1010.40 --> 1011.12]  do not understand
[1011.12 --> 1011.76]  how that happened.
[1011.90 --> 1012.82]  It doesn't matter now.
[1013.06 --> 1014.24]  But what does matter is
[1014.24 --> 1015.58]  that phone call
[1015.58 --> 1016.24]  when I received it,
[1016.24 --> 1017.12]  my first thought was,
[1017.12 --> 1018.56]  my in-laws don't even know
[1018.56 --> 1019.74]  I gave their car away
[1019.74 --> 1021.10]  and now it's destroyed.
[1021.54 --> 1022.30]  So that night,
[1022.50 --> 1023.52]  I gave them a call,
[1023.72 --> 1025.14]  very difficult call to make,
[1025.26 --> 1025.42]  right?
[1025.46 --> 1026.18]  How do you break this?
[1026.24 --> 1026.38]  You're like,
[1026.42 --> 1027.02]  how's the weather?
[1027.88 --> 1029.36]  How's things going?
[1029.84 --> 1030.36]  And then I had to
[1030.36 --> 1031.06]  break the news to them.
[1031.12 --> 1031.30]  I'm like,
[1031.38 --> 1032.58]  and I lent it your car
[1032.58 --> 1033.32]  and it is now
[1033.32 --> 1034.60]  completely totaled
[1034.60 --> 1035.42]  and there's a lot of things
[1035.42 --> 1036.04]  I got to sort out
[1036.04 --> 1036.64]  with your insurance.
[1037.34 --> 1038.48]  And the first thing
[1038.48 --> 1039.72]  they said to me was,
[1039.88 --> 1041.12]  it's just a car.
[1041.12 --> 1043.82]  And my heart just was like,
[1043.92 --> 1045.00]  oh, thank the Lord.
[1045.38 --> 1046.38]  I'm so happy
[1046.38 --> 1047.34]  you don't want to like
[1047.34 --> 1048.66]  disown me as a son-in-law.
[1049.06 --> 1050.46]  But that was a teaching moment
[1050.46 --> 1050.84]  for me
[1050.84 --> 1051.62]  because I'm not sure
[1051.62 --> 1052.52]  I'd respond that way
[1052.52 --> 1053.72]  if someone smashed up my car
[1053.72 --> 1054.80]  that was lent out
[1054.80 --> 1055.72]  in my absence
[1055.72 --> 1056.86]  without my knowledge, right?
[1057.24 --> 1058.16]  But it was this moment
[1058.16 --> 1058.56]  where I'm like,
[1058.72 --> 1060.28]  that's the flinch
[1060.28 --> 1061.36]  of a Christian, right?
[1061.88 --> 1062.98]  That's how we respond
[1062.98 --> 1063.62]  because they knew
[1063.62 --> 1064.58]  the intention was good,
[1064.82 --> 1065.50]  they knew it was given
[1065.50 --> 1066.32]  to someone who had need
[1066.32 --> 1067.38]  and that's what they want
[1067.38 --> 1068.14]  for their stuff.
[1068.94 --> 1069.90]  They want to be generous
[1069.90 --> 1070.66]  and open-handed.
[1071.32 --> 1072.16]  And I almost want
[1072.16 --> 1072.78]  to ask the question,
[1072.88 --> 1073.72]  how open-handedly
[1073.72 --> 1074.38]  do we live with,
[1074.44 --> 1075.36]  not just with our money,
[1075.46 --> 1076.08]  which is important,
[1076.32 --> 1077.56]  but with our stuff?
[1079.50 --> 1080.16]  And it's at this point
[1080.16 --> 1080.64]  that I want to draw
[1080.64 --> 1081.02]  our attention
[1081.02 --> 1082.00]  to that middle section
[1082.00 --> 1082.90]  of this passage.
[1083.92 --> 1085.30]  Very weirdly positioned,
[1085.42 --> 1085.84]  people are like,
[1085.92 --> 1086.66]  why is it here, right?
[1087.18 --> 1088.04]  Jesus talks about
[1088.04 --> 1088.56]  our possessions
[1088.56 --> 1089.20]  and our treasures,
[1089.32 --> 1089.76]  then at the end
[1089.76 --> 1090.62]  he talks about our money
[1090.62 --> 1091.64]  and not having two masters,
[1091.78 --> 1092.44]  and then in the middle
[1092.44 --> 1093.26]  there's this whole section
[1093.26 --> 1094.24]  on like light
[1094.24 --> 1094.88]  and our eyes
[1094.88 --> 1095.42]  and darkness,
[1095.52 --> 1096.24]  and I'll read for you
[1096.24 --> 1097.52]  just one part of it
[1097.52 --> 1098.40]  and then explain
[1098.40 --> 1098.90]  what I think
[1098.90 --> 1099.64]  is why it's here.
[1100.60 --> 1101.20]  Jesus says,
[1101.66 --> 1102.82]  if your eyes are healthy,
[1103.00 --> 1103.68]  your whole body
[1103.68 --> 1104.64]  will be full of light,
[1104.82 --> 1105.46]  and if your eyes
[1105.46 --> 1106.10]  are unhealthy,
[1106.22 --> 1106.90]  your whole body
[1106.90 --> 1107.78]  will be full of darkness.
[1108.40 --> 1109.24]  Now different takes
[1109.24 --> 1109.56]  on this,
[1109.62 --> 1110.92]  but here's an interesting fact.
[1111.38 --> 1112.28]  The words healthy
[1112.28 --> 1113.28]  and unhealthy here
[1113.28 --> 1113.70]  in Greek
[1113.70 --> 1115.40]  translate to this word
[1115.40 --> 1116.02]  in English,
[1117.36 --> 1117.70]  generous,
[1118.46 --> 1119.76]  and I'll use the word stingy.
[1120.64 --> 1121.40]  And it's almost
[1121.40 --> 1122.56]  as though Jesus is saying,
[1122.66 --> 1122.82]  you know,
[1122.90 --> 1123.78]  this sense of like,
[1123.84 --> 1124.74]  if you are generous,
[1124.82 --> 1126.14]  it reveals a heart
[1126.14 --> 1126.82]  that is generous.
[1127.54 --> 1128.48]  And if you are stingy,
[1128.52 --> 1129.08]  it reveals a heart
[1129.08 --> 1129.74]  that is dark
[1129.74 --> 1130.66]  and ingenerous.
[1130.80 --> 1131.64]  Almost like a tree
[1131.64 --> 1132.68]  that bears good fruit
[1132.68 --> 1133.50]  or a bad tree
[1133.50 --> 1134.38]  that bears bad fruit.
[1134.46 --> 1135.92]  But generosity reveals
[1135.92 --> 1137.82]  a heart of health.
[1138.74 --> 1139.48]  And that's why
[1139.48 --> 1140.16]  it's placed there.
[1140.16 --> 1142.98]  But in our context,
[1142.98 --> 1143.76]  I'm just going to say this
[1143.76 --> 1144.54]  as clear as I can,
[1144.62 --> 1145.22]  I think there is
[1145.22 --> 1146.66]  a profound temptation
[1146.66 --> 1148.56]  for us to be selfish,
[1149.38 --> 1149.90]  entitled,
[1150.66 --> 1151.94]  and possessive.
[1152.62 --> 1152.92]  Right?
[1153.26 --> 1153.92]  We're selfish
[1153.92 --> 1154.86]  with the stuff we have,
[1155.10 --> 1155.92]  we feel entitled
[1155.92 --> 1156.58]  to more and more
[1156.58 --> 1157.24]  of that stuff,
[1157.30 --> 1158.34]  and the stuff we have,
[1158.38 --> 1159.08]  we sort of hoard
[1159.08 --> 1159.78]  to ourselves.
[1160.52 --> 1161.20]  And that story
[1161.20 --> 1161.84]  of my in-laws
[1161.84 --> 1162.64]  was one of those moments
[1162.64 --> 1162.96]  where I'm like,
[1163.00 --> 1164.02]  yeah, sharing the stuff
[1164.02 --> 1164.64]  we have
[1164.64 --> 1165.54]  is the calling
[1165.54 --> 1166.16]  of the church.
[1166.80 --> 1167.76]  And I sometimes worry
[1167.76 --> 1168.48]  that we amass
[1168.48 --> 1169.10]  so much stuff
[1169.10 --> 1169.86]  and then as Christians,
[1170.00 --> 1170.88]  we do what everyone else does.
[1171.04 --> 1172.38]  We sort of put our arms around it.
[1172.42 --> 1172.58]  We say,
[1172.66 --> 1173.94]  we're not willing to share it.
[1174.36 --> 1174.84]  We're not willing
[1174.84 --> 1175.50]  to lend it out
[1175.50 --> 1176.70]  to people who might scratch it
[1176.70 --> 1177.20]  or dent it
[1177.20 --> 1177.86]  or use it in a way
[1177.86 --> 1178.54]  we're not happy with.
[1178.70 --> 1179.14]  And it's like,
[1179.26 --> 1179.50]  really?
[1180.00 --> 1180.72]  Is that how the church
[1180.72 --> 1181.44]  is called to live
[1181.44 --> 1182.76]  with all the stuff
[1182.76 --> 1183.76]  God has given us?
[1184.10 --> 1185.00]  I'm not so sure.
[1185.88 --> 1186.82]  And I think we're invited
[1186.82 --> 1187.66]  to a sense of
[1187.66 --> 1189.08]  healthy detachment
[1189.08 --> 1191.04]  with our earthly treasures.
[1192.06 --> 1193.30]  And this increasing
[1193.30 --> 1194.68]  spirit-led eagerness
[1194.68 --> 1196.08]  to see other people
[1196.08 --> 1196.84]  blessed
[1196.84 --> 1198.82]  by the stuff we have
[1198.82 --> 1200.04]  cared for
[1200.04 --> 1200.74]  by the resources
[1200.74 --> 1201.42]  we have
[1201.42 --> 1203.04]  used for its purposes
[1203.04 --> 1204.12]  in ways that other people
[1204.12 --> 1205.06]  can be blessed by.
[1207.44 --> 1208.04]  I remember
[1208.04 --> 1209.06]  visiting a pastor
[1209.06 --> 1209.76]  in San Diego.
[1210.94 --> 1211.30]  In fact,
[1211.34 --> 1212.22]  I visited him in November
[1212.22 --> 1213.68]  which is a super dangerous time
[1213.68 --> 1214.94]  to fly from B.C.
[1214.98 --> 1215.60]  to San Diego
[1215.60 --> 1216.16]  because it's like
[1216.16 --> 1216.84]  pouring rain
[1216.84 --> 1217.34]  and depressing.
[1217.78 --> 1218.40]  Then I got to visit
[1218.40 --> 1219.68]  this sunny church plant
[1219.68 --> 1220.22]  in San Diego.
[1220.32 --> 1220.46]  I'm like,
[1220.48 --> 1221.42]  how do I get this gig?
[1221.52 --> 1222.42]  Right by the ocean.
[1222.98 --> 1224.06]  And I'm visiting this pastor.
[1224.18 --> 1225.64]  He's in a very affluent neighborhood.
[1226.32 --> 1227.02]  And it just felt like
[1227.02 --> 1227.86]  he had everything put together
[1227.86 --> 1228.56]  in his church.
[1228.76 --> 1229.06]  I'm like,
[1229.12 --> 1230.14]  so what are the joys
[1230.14 --> 1231.14]  and challenges of your church?
[1231.20 --> 1232.36]  And he went on to tell me
[1232.36 --> 1234.10]  how deeply
[1234.10 --> 1235.80]  his church was challenged
[1235.80 --> 1236.82]  with their finances
[1236.82 --> 1237.68]  and their resources.
[1237.84 --> 1238.70]  And you would never know it
[1238.70 --> 1239.24]  because it's this
[1239.24 --> 1240.50]  beautiful community.
[1240.60 --> 1241.54]  Most people live very close
[1241.54 --> 1242.02]  to the church.
[1242.30 --> 1242.56]  And he says,
[1242.60 --> 1243.78]  but you would not believe
[1243.78 --> 1245.52]  how many people in my church
[1245.52 --> 1247.22]  live with crushing levels
[1247.22 --> 1247.66]  of debt.
[1248.94 --> 1249.74]  How many people
[1249.74 --> 1250.58]  in my church
[1250.58 --> 1252.14]  are living so far
[1252.14 --> 1252.88]  beyond their means
[1252.88 --> 1254.18]  that all they talk about
[1254.18 --> 1254.58]  at home
[1254.58 --> 1255.34]  when the kids are in bed
[1255.34 --> 1256.52]  is the stress
[1256.52 --> 1257.58]  they feel financially?
[1258.20 --> 1259.10]  How many families
[1259.10 --> 1259.50]  in the church
[1259.50 --> 1261.06]  are two paychecks away
[1261.06 --> 1261.88]  from bankruptcy
[1261.88 --> 1263.12]  and all the stuff
[1263.12 --> 1263.52]  they have
[1263.52 --> 1264.34]  gets repossessed
[1264.34 --> 1265.50]  and taken by the government?
[1266.32 --> 1267.40]  And what he was explaining
[1267.40 --> 1267.72]  to me
[1267.72 --> 1268.46]  was the crushing
[1268.46 --> 1270.42]  weight of idolatry.
[1271.12 --> 1272.26]  In the church,
[1272.52 --> 1273.32]  I should add.
[1273.72 --> 1273.94]  Right?
[1274.00 --> 1274.68]  These are Christians
[1274.68 --> 1275.98]  participating in the life
[1275.98 --> 1276.34]  of the church
[1276.34 --> 1277.00]  not realizing
[1277.00 --> 1277.86]  that this God
[1277.86 --> 1278.88]  that is named money
[1278.88 --> 1279.92]  was being worshipped
[1279.92 --> 1280.98]  and it was failing.
[1281.72 --> 1282.34]  And I wonder,
[1282.44 --> 1283.38]  is that true for us too?
[1283.38 --> 1285.82]  And is the antidote then
[1285.82 --> 1287.64]  this radical posture
[1287.64 --> 1288.38]  of generosity
[1288.38 --> 1290.74]  of parting with our stuff,
[1291.64 --> 1292.60]  lending out what needs
[1292.60 --> 1293.24]  to be lended out
[1293.24 --> 1293.90]  for other people,
[1294.34 --> 1295.30]  parting with our money,
[1295.52 --> 1296.46]  tithing generously
[1296.46 --> 1297.60]  so that we would truly
[1297.60 --> 1298.48]  be a blessing
[1298.48 --> 1300.08]  to those around us?
[1301.26 --> 1302.32]  Can you part with your stuff?
[1303.72 --> 1304.60]  Can you tithe?
[1305.18 --> 1306.58]  Even when finances feel tight?
[1306.98 --> 1307.80]  These are the questions
[1307.80 --> 1309.04]  Jesus presses in on us
[1309.04 --> 1309.74]  in this passage.
[1309.74 --> 1312.24]  The third way
[1312.24 --> 1313.56]  in which we store up
[1313.56 --> 1314.04]  for ourselves
[1314.04 --> 1315.02]  treasures in heaven,
[1315.94 --> 1316.66]  and this one I think
[1316.66 --> 1317.18]  for many of us
[1317.18 --> 1317.78]  will be challenging,
[1318.36 --> 1319.80]  is cultivating relationships
[1319.80 --> 1320.38]  with people
[1320.38 --> 1321.08]  who are vulnerable,
[1322.02 --> 1323.10]  who are in need,
[1323.66 --> 1324.68]  who are economically
[1324.68 --> 1325.40]  struggling.
[1326.66 --> 1327.60]  And maybe you've noticed
[1327.60 --> 1328.26]  this, maybe you haven't,
[1328.30 --> 1328.74]  but I've learned
[1328.74 --> 1329.56]  that if your circle
[1329.56 --> 1330.14]  of people
[1330.14 --> 1331.62]  is mostly people
[1331.62 --> 1332.10]  who are middle
[1332.10 --> 1332.90]  to upper class,
[1333.10 --> 1334.32]  you will start to think
[1334.32 --> 1334.88]  like someone
[1334.88 --> 1335.26]  who is middle
[1335.26 --> 1335.98]  to upper class
[1335.98 --> 1337.12]  and you'll normalize
[1337.12 --> 1337.78]  conversations,
[1338.20 --> 1338.90]  lifestyles,
[1339.26 --> 1340.14]  ways you live
[1340.14 --> 1340.92]  that are probably
[1340.92 --> 1341.74]  not normal
[1341.74 --> 1342.82]  anywhere else in the world
[1342.82 --> 1343.94]  and not normal
[1343.94 --> 1344.50]  for other people
[1344.50 --> 1344.98]  in our city.
[1345.64 --> 1346.44]  But it's when you get
[1346.44 --> 1347.28]  close to where
[1347.28 --> 1348.44]  the needs are
[1348.44 --> 1349.76]  that you start
[1349.76 --> 1350.44]  to think differently.
[1351.10 --> 1351.96]  It's when you really
[1351.96 --> 1352.80]  get to know people
[1352.80 --> 1353.32]  who are struggling
[1353.32 --> 1353.80]  that you start
[1353.80 --> 1354.46]  thinking differently
[1354.46 --> 1355.16]  about your finances,
[1355.32 --> 1355.78]  your resources,
[1355.92 --> 1356.30]  your home,
[1356.40 --> 1357.18]  all the rest.
[1357.60 --> 1358.48]  It's getting close
[1358.48 --> 1359.08]  to those places
[1359.08 --> 1359.64]  of brokenness
[1359.64 --> 1360.44]  where God's Spirit
[1360.44 --> 1361.62]  seems to move in us
[1361.62 --> 1363.02]  this desire to use
[1363.02 --> 1363.68]  what we've been given
[1363.68 --> 1364.42]  to bless.
[1364.42 --> 1366.00]  And you know this,
[1366.06 --> 1366.62]  whenever a team
[1366.62 --> 1367.92]  comes back from a serve trip,
[1368.14 --> 1369.18]  that's what they talk about.
[1369.68 --> 1370.18]  Whenever people
[1370.18 --> 1371.10]  come back from serving
[1371.10 --> 1371.64]  at the Clovedo
[1371.64 --> 1372.20]  Community Kitchen,
[1372.28 --> 1373.22]  it just reframes
[1373.22 --> 1373.90]  the way you see
[1373.90 --> 1374.48]  your stuff,
[1374.82 --> 1375.38]  your home,
[1375.50 --> 1376.12]  your lifestyle,
[1376.30 --> 1377.12]  because you know
[1377.12 --> 1378.14]  how it could be used
[1378.14 --> 1379.12]  to serve.
[1380.04 --> 1381.60]  And God wants us
[1381.60 --> 1382.86]  to kindle
[1382.86 --> 1384.12]  that imagination
[1384.12 --> 1385.40]  of our resources
[1385.40 --> 1386.40]  being used to bless,
[1386.94 --> 1387.98]  cultivating relationships
[1387.98 --> 1389.16]  that get us close
[1389.16 --> 1390.04]  to where the needs are.
[1390.30 --> 1391.52]  That's our calling
[1391.52 --> 1392.78]  as the church.
[1394.42 --> 1396.36]  Now finally,
[1396.48 --> 1397.42]  I want to just get right
[1397.42 --> 1398.50]  into everybody's business
[1398.50 --> 1400.54]  because I felt compelled
[1400.54 --> 1401.16]  to include this
[1401.16 --> 1401.62]  in my sermon
[1401.62 --> 1402.56]  at the last second
[1402.56 --> 1403.80]  and it's challenging to me.
[1404.24 --> 1405.06]  If you live in
[1405.06 --> 1405.64]  British Columbia,
[1406.08 --> 1406.60]  you're probably thinking
[1406.60 --> 1408.18]  as you listen to the sermon
[1408.18 --> 1408.56]  you're going to be like,
[1409.12 --> 1410.90]  how do we do this
[1410.90 --> 1411.74]  in like one of the most
[1411.74 --> 1412.40]  expensive cities
[1412.40 --> 1412.84]  in the world?
[1413.46 --> 1414.08]  And I'm thinking
[1414.08 --> 1415.44]  especially of young people
[1415.44 --> 1415.90]  right now.
[1416.00 --> 1416.76]  It's like buying a house
[1416.76 --> 1417.44]  feels impossible,
[1417.66 --> 1418.26]  paying off a car
[1418.26 --> 1418.80]  feels impossible,
[1418.98 --> 1419.92]  education is expensive,
[1420.24 --> 1421.14]  everything's expensive.
[1421.14 --> 1422.56]  And what you'll think
[1422.56 --> 1423.34]  in the back of your mind
[1423.34 --> 1423.80]  is this,
[1423.88 --> 1424.62]  because I've thought it,
[1425.20 --> 1425.98]  if I just made
[1425.98 --> 1427.08]  a little bit more money,
[1427.94 --> 1429.86]  then I'll be generous.
[1430.04 --> 1430.88]  Have you thought that before?
[1431.82 --> 1433.46]  If I got that raise,
[1433.74 --> 1434.42]  oh man,
[1434.52 --> 1435.36]  then I would give money.
[1435.56 --> 1437.02]  If I paid off my mortgage
[1437.02 --> 1438.26]  or paid off that car loan
[1438.26 --> 1439.68]  or got rid of that student debt,
[1439.96 --> 1440.64]  whatever it is,
[1440.70 --> 1441.24]  fill in the blank,
[1441.52 --> 1442.76]  then I'll be generous,
[1443.00 --> 1443.24]  right?
[1443.90 --> 1444.74]  And that is just
[1444.74 --> 1445.98]  such a dangerous lie.
[1445.98 --> 1449.10]  A year ago or so,
[1449.32 --> 1450.22]  we did a podcast
[1450.22 --> 1451.22]  with a guy named
[1451.22 --> 1453.04]  Jordan Birch.
[1453.14 --> 1453.74]  He actually used to
[1453.74 --> 1454.36]  worship with us
[1454.36 --> 1455.46]  and now he fled
[1455.46 --> 1456.02]  for the island
[1456.02 --> 1456.82]  for cheaper housing.
[1456.90 --> 1457.30]  I'm just kidding,
[1457.38 --> 1458.06]  his family lives there.
[1458.84 --> 1460.18]  And God has just given
[1460.18 --> 1461.26]  this guy a lot of wisdom
[1461.26 --> 1461.70]  on money.
[1461.78 --> 1462.34]  And if you want to listen
[1462.34 --> 1462.92]  to his podcast,
[1463.08 --> 1463.62]  you can look it up
[1463.62 --> 1464.68]  in our Hope podcast.
[1465.20 --> 1466.18]  But he was just sharing
[1466.18 --> 1467.64]  about what God was teaching him
[1467.64 --> 1468.70]  and how he's trying to live
[1468.70 --> 1469.80]  and then he gave this principle,
[1469.96 --> 1470.64]  which is a very
[1470.64 --> 1471.38]  biblical principle
[1471.38 --> 1472.60]  and it's just stuck with me
[1472.60 --> 1473.58]  and it's on the screen here.
[1474.60 --> 1475.40]  Very simple,
[1475.40 --> 1476.56]  very true.
[1477.16 --> 1478.22]  If you are generous
[1478.22 --> 1478.86]  with little,
[1479.06 --> 1479.78]  you will be generous
[1479.78 --> 1480.44]  with much.
[1481.00 --> 1482.02]  If you are not generous
[1482.02 --> 1482.56]  with little,
[1483.04 --> 1484.12]  you will not be generous
[1484.12 --> 1484.74]  with much.
[1485.40 --> 1486.26]  Tell me I'm wrong.
[1487.94 --> 1488.72]  And so I want to say
[1488.72 --> 1489.86]  to every one of us
[1489.86 --> 1491.30]  who maybe this morning
[1491.30 --> 1492.04]  might be feeling
[1492.04 --> 1493.06]  pressure financially
[1493.06 --> 1493.52]  because I think
[1493.52 --> 1494.24]  a lot of us are.
[1495.08 --> 1495.96]  You can be generous,
[1496.44 --> 1497.62]  not just with your money,
[1498.00 --> 1498.96]  but with your resources,
[1499.56 --> 1500.10]  your time,
[1500.26 --> 1501.00]  and all the stuff
[1501.00 --> 1501.94]  God has given to you
[1501.94 --> 1502.54]  to steward.
[1503.22 --> 1504.04]  You can be generous
[1504.04 --> 1504.54]  with little
[1504.54 --> 1505.46]  and also begin
[1505.46 --> 1505.96]  to pray
[1505.96 --> 1507.46]  that should you have much,
[1507.52 --> 1508.46]  you will also be generous
[1508.46 --> 1508.90]  with much
[1508.90 --> 1509.40]  because I think
[1509.40 --> 1510.00]  it's a practice
[1510.00 --> 1510.94]  we learn
[1510.94 --> 1511.84]  when we're young.
[1512.66 --> 1512.84]  You know,
[1512.88 --> 1513.24]  one of the things
[1513.24 --> 1514.04]  I give thanks for
[1514.04 --> 1514.92]  is I have parents
[1514.92 --> 1516.26]  who forced me to give.
[1516.94 --> 1517.96]  When I got my first job,
[1518.02 --> 1518.40]  which was like
[1518.40 --> 1519.56]  way back in grade seven,
[1519.96 --> 1520.70]  my mom would
[1520.70 --> 1521.62]  fastidiously
[1521.62 --> 1522.54]  go through my income
[1522.54 --> 1522.98]  with me
[1522.98 --> 1523.66]  and teach me
[1523.66 --> 1524.10]  how to write
[1524.10 --> 1525.02]  these little thing
[1525.02 --> 1525.68]  called checks
[1525.68 --> 1526.64]  to the church
[1526.64 --> 1528.34]  and I resented it.
[1529.12 --> 1529.58]  I did.
[1529.58 --> 1531.78]  But it trained in me
[1531.78 --> 1532.84]  this practice of giving,
[1533.00 --> 1533.94]  a thing that I needed
[1533.94 --> 1534.32]  to learn
[1534.32 --> 1535.22]  that does not come
[1535.22 --> 1535.92]  naturally to me.
[1536.00 --> 1536.92]  I think I can easily
[1536.92 --> 1537.88]  fall into greed
[1537.88 --> 1539.48]  and upward mobility thinking
[1539.48 --> 1540.06]  and jealousy
[1540.06 --> 1541.28]  towards those who have more
[1541.28 --> 1542.24]  and this practice
[1542.24 --> 1542.84]  of generosity
[1542.84 --> 1543.88]  breaks it slowly.
[1544.72 --> 1545.42]  God uses it,
[1545.46 --> 1547.14]  but you start that small.
[1547.56 --> 1548.58]  You start that young.
[1548.68 --> 1549.08]  And parents,
[1549.18 --> 1549.78]  let me just say,
[1550.26 --> 1551.26]  teach your kids young
[1551.26 --> 1551.98]  how to give
[1551.98 --> 1553.42]  because we want to train
[1553.42 --> 1554.30]  the next generation
[1554.30 --> 1555.62]  the generosity
[1555.62 --> 1557.06]  that Jesus invites us into
[1557.06 --> 1558.08]  as the church.
[1560.16 --> 1561.08]  To summarize,
[1562.42 --> 1563.60]  in our story,
[1563.68 --> 1564.82]  that is the biblical story,
[1565.14 --> 1566.42]  God owns it all.
[1566.84 --> 1567.46]  Praise the Lord
[1567.46 --> 1568.14]  that there is someone
[1568.14 --> 1569.08]  who is in control
[1569.08 --> 1570.02]  and has ownership
[1570.02 --> 1570.64]  of the world,
[1570.74 --> 1571.18]  our city,
[1571.46 --> 1571.90]  your home,
[1572.00 --> 1572.48]  your stuff,
[1572.80 --> 1573.38]  your finances.
[1574.48 --> 1575.60]  And we turn our hearts
[1575.60 --> 1576.32]  to Him in gratitude.
[1577.28 --> 1577.90]  And this morning
[1577.90 --> 1578.50]  of all mornings,
[1578.62 --> 1578.96]  Thanksgiving,
[1579.12 --> 1579.38]  we say,
[1579.50 --> 1580.00]  thank you God.
[1580.10 --> 1581.32]  You are a generous Father.
[1581.76 --> 1583.12]  You give us every good thing
[1583.12 --> 1583.80]  to be enjoyed
[1583.80 --> 1584.38]  and to be shared.
[1584.72 --> 1586.46]  You are very good to us.
[1587.84 --> 1588.32]  Secondly,
[1588.92 --> 1591.06]  in the center of our story
[1591.06 --> 1592.76]  is Jesus coming
[1592.76 --> 1594.64]  to break the power of sin.
[1594.72 --> 1595.30]  And we've said this
[1595.30 --> 1595.90]  throughout the series
[1595.90 --> 1597.24]  and now we'll focus it on money.
[1597.80 --> 1598.82]  Jesus comes
[1598.82 --> 1600.18]  to free us
[1600.18 --> 1601.16]  from slavery
[1601.16 --> 1601.94]  through the cross.
[1602.12 --> 1603.32]  And that includes
[1603.32 --> 1605.02]  slavery to the idols
[1605.02 --> 1606.10]  worshipped in our culture
[1606.10 --> 1607.12]  and that is mammon,
[1607.70 --> 1608.20]  money,
[1608.94 --> 1609.46]  stuff,
[1609.84 --> 1610.32]  possessions,
[1610.58 --> 1611.20]  consumptions,
[1611.34 --> 1611.96]  and travel.
[1612.34 --> 1613.04]  Jesus came
[1613.04 --> 1614.48]  to break the power of sin
[1614.48 --> 1615.66]  in this church
[1615.66 --> 1616.96]  so that we can learn
[1616.96 --> 1617.94]  the way of discipleship.
[1618.68 --> 1619.16]  That is the way
[1619.16 --> 1619.72]  of simplicity,
[1620.52 --> 1621.20]  the way of gratitude,
[1621.82 --> 1622.70]  the way of generosity,
[1623.42 --> 1624.18]  the way of blessing
[1624.18 --> 1625.34]  with all that God
[1625.34 --> 1626.16]  has given us.
[1626.78 --> 1627.60]  And Jesus says to us
[1627.60 --> 1628.34]  in this passage,
[1628.86 --> 1630.82]  that is how you store up
[1630.82 --> 1631.30]  for yourselves
[1631.30 --> 1632.70]  treasures in heaven.
[1632.70 --> 1636.82]  I'm going to read
[1636.82 --> 1637.38]  a prayer
[1637.38 --> 1638.44]  in closing.
[1639.24 --> 1640.54]  And it's a small adaptation
[1640.54 --> 1641.66]  of what you heard
[1641.66 --> 1642.28]  on that video
[1642.28 --> 1643.26]  earlier in the service.
[1643.50 --> 1644.52]  So would you join me
[1644.52 --> 1645.06]  in this prayer?
[1648.56 --> 1649.04]  Father,
[1649.14 --> 1649.98]  there is nothing
[1649.98 --> 1651.74]  that we have received
[1651.74 --> 1653.06]  that does not come
[1653.06 --> 1653.48]  from you.
[1654.40 --> 1655.62]  All that we have
[1655.62 --> 1656.28]  and are
[1656.28 --> 1657.74]  belongs to you,
[1658.26 --> 1658.98]  bought with your
[1658.98 --> 1659.86]  Son's blood
[1659.86 --> 1660.98]  and we thank you
[1660.98 --> 1661.44]  for it.
[1662.16 --> 1663.02]  To spend everything
[1663.02 --> 1663.66]  on ourselves
[1663.66 --> 1664.94]  and give without sacrifice
[1664.94 --> 1665.86]  is the way
[1665.86 --> 1666.96]  of our world
[1666.96 --> 1667.98]  and the Father
[1667.98 --> 1669.20]  does not abide
[1669.20 --> 1669.86]  in it.
[1671.34 --> 1671.86]  Generosity
[1671.86 --> 1672.82]  is the way
[1672.82 --> 1673.50]  of Christ,
[1674.22 --> 1675.12]  the way of those
[1675.12 --> 1675.86]  who call you
[1675.86 --> 1676.56]  our Lord.
[1677.76 --> 1678.82]  Would you increase
[1678.82 --> 1679.82]  our generosity
[1679.82 --> 1680.96]  so that it can be said
[1680.96 --> 1681.76]  of us that there is
[1681.76 --> 1683.04]  no needy person
[1683.04 --> 1683.80]  among us.
[1684.64 --> 1686.30]  Make us faithful stewards
[1686.30 --> 1687.66]  of such a little thing
[1687.66 --> 1688.18]  as money
[1688.18 --> 1689.66]  that Christ may trust
[1689.66 --> 1691.28]  us with true riches.
[1692.72 --> 1693.92]  Make us generous,
[1694.24 --> 1694.42]  Lord,
[1694.54 --> 1695.70]  because you
[1695.70 --> 1697.58]  are generous
[1697.58 --> 1699.50]  and we desire
[1699.50 --> 1700.60]  to show the world
[1700.60 --> 1702.64]  what you are like.
[1703.48 --> 1703.82]  Amen.
[1705.48 --> 1706.64]  Would you stand
[1706.64 --> 1707.58]  and join me
[1707.58 --> 1708.42]  in singing a song
[1708.42 --> 1709.04]  of response,
[1709.18 --> 1710.36]  a song that celebrates
[1710.36 --> 1711.64]  our generous Father.
[1711.64 --> 1727.12]  song of
[1727.12 --> 1730.12]  I love you, Lord.
[1730.18 --> 1730.70]  I love you, Lord.
[1732.00 --> 1733.70]  For your mercy
[1733.70 --> 1736.02]  never fails me.
[1736.02 --> 1738.50]  All my life
[1738.50 --> 1741.00]  I've been held
[1741.00 --> 1742.50]  in the air
[1742.50 --> 1745.18]  from the moon
[1745.18 --> 1747.50]  that I wake up
[1747.50 --> 1751.24]  until I lay my head
[1751.24 --> 1753.50]  I will see
[1753.50 --> 1756.50]  of your grace
[1756.50 --> 1757.32]  upon
[1757.32 --> 1762.94]  All my life
[1762.94 --> 1765.38]  you have been faithful
[1765.38 --> 1770.34]  All my life
[1770.34 --> 1772.20]  you have been so,
[1772.34 --> 1774.42]  so glad
[1774.42 --> 1777.60]  Every breath
[1777.60 --> 1779.98]  that I am able
[1779.98 --> 1783.42]  I will sing
[1783.42 --> 1784.86]  of the goodness
[1784.86 --> 1787.16]  of God
[1787.16 --> 1794.40]  You have led me
[1794.40 --> 1796.12]  through the fire
[1796.12 --> 1797.50]  You have led me
[1797.50 --> 1798.46]  through the fire
[1798.46 --> 1799.00]  You have led me
[1799.00 --> 1799.54]  through the fire
[1799.54 --> 1801.36]  You are close
[1801.36 --> 1802.70]  like no other
[1802.70 --> 1805.58]  I've known You
[1805.58 --> 1807.12]  as a father
[1807.12 --> 1811.64]  I've known you as a friend
[1811.64 --> 1817.90]  I have been in the midst of God
[1817.90 --> 1819.90]  Oh my Lord
[1819.90 --> 1824.88]  All my life you have been faithful
[1824.88 --> 1834.92]  All my life you have been so, so good
[1834.92 --> 1839.02]  Every breath that I am able
[1839.02 --> 1845.74]  I will sing of the goodness of God
[1845.74 --> 1851.92]  Your goodness is running after me
[1851.92 --> 1854.92]  It's running after me
[1854.92 --> 1858.82]  Your goodness is running after
[1858.82 --> 1861.78]  It's running after me
[1861.78 --> 1865.88]  With my life laid down and surrendered now
[1865.88 --> 1868.88]  I'll give you everything
[1868.88 --> 1872.88]  Your goodness is running after
[1872.88 --> 1874.40]  It's running after me
[1874.40 --> 1876.22]  Sing it again, your goodness
[1876.22 --> 1879.32]  Your goodness is running after
[1879.32 --> 1883.32]  It's running after me
[1883.32 --> 1886.32]  Your goodness is running after
[1886.32 --> 1889.32]  It's running after me
[1889.32 --> 1893.32]  With my life laid down and surrendered now
[1893.32 --> 1896.32]  I'll give you everything
[1896.32 --> 1900.32]  Your goodness is running after
[1900.32 --> 1903.42]  It's running after me
[1903.42 --> 1905.42]  It's running after me
[1905.42 --> 1911.42]  All my life you have been faithful
[1911.42 --> 1920.42]  All my life you have been so, so good
[1920.42 --> 1925.52]  Every breath that I am able
[1925.52 --> 1931.52]  I will sing of the goodness of God
[1931.52 --> 1933.52]  Sing it again, all my life
[1933.52 --> 1939.52]  In all my life you have been faithful
[1939.52 --> 1964.62]  In all my life you have been faithful
[1964.62 --> 1969.26]  Of the goodness of God
[1969.26 --> 1971.64]  I will sing
[1971.64 --> 1976.96]  Of the goodness of God
[1976.96 --> 1981.98]  I invite you to be seated.
[1990.70 --> 1992.08]  At this time in the service,
[1992.08 --> 1994.66]  we get to gather around the table of grace
[1994.66 --> 1995.90]  and celebrate communion.
[1997.08 --> 1998.02]  And we're going to do communion
[1998.02 --> 1999.38]  a little bit differently today.
[1999.70 --> 2001.98]  And I would say it's more of a celebratory communion.
[2002.28 --> 2003.64]  In fact, it was a year ago today
[2003.64 --> 2005.28]  where we had this style of communion
[2005.28 --> 2007.10]  where someone came up to me afterwards
[2007.10 --> 2007.92]  and said, you know,
[2008.36 --> 2011.08]  I never realized that communion can be celebration.
[2012.04 --> 2013.12]  And to that I want to say,
[2013.26 --> 2014.80]  absolutely it can.
[2015.42 --> 2017.00]  Because it's in this meal
[2017.00 --> 2019.26]  where we recognize and remember
[2019.26 --> 2021.68]  that Jesus Christ defeated
[2021.68 --> 2023.40]  the power of Satan,
[2023.98 --> 2025.42]  the finality of death,
[2025.62 --> 2027.74]  and the luring temptation of sin.
[2028.32 --> 2030.10]  He gains victory over it.
[2030.14 --> 2030.70]  And in this meal,
[2030.78 --> 2032.58]  we celebrate that the grace of Jesus
[2032.58 --> 2034.56]  reaches all the way
[2034.56 --> 2036.32]  into our ordinary lives
[2036.32 --> 2039.84]  and pulls us into salvation in him.
[2040.20 --> 2040.96]  So today,
[2041.36 --> 2043.36]  we're going to celebrate communion.
[2043.48 --> 2044.16]  Does that sound good?
[2044.16 --> 2047.74]  On the night Jesus was betrayed,
[2047.86 --> 2048.58]  he took bread.
[2049.16 --> 2050.04]  And after he broke it,
[2050.08 --> 2050.84]  he gave thanks,
[2051.00 --> 2052.10]  saying to his disciples,
[2052.62 --> 2054.84]  this is my body.
[2055.48 --> 2057.00]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[2058.14 --> 2058.94]  In the same way,
[2059.02 --> 2059.90]  Jesus took the cup.
[2061.02 --> 2062.02]  And after he poured it,
[2062.84 --> 2063.82]  he said to his disciples,
[2064.10 --> 2066.92]  this is my blood shed for you.
[2067.54 --> 2069.44]  Do this in remembrance of me.
[2069.44 --> 2071.68]  And we echo the words
[2071.68 --> 2073.28]  of the Apostle Paul in Corinthians
[2073.28 --> 2073.92]  when he says,
[2074.16 --> 2075.96]  whenever we drink this cup
[2075.96 --> 2077.24]  and eat this bread,
[2077.84 --> 2081.06]  we proclaim the death of Jesus Christ
[2081.06 --> 2083.82]  until he comes again.
[2084.46 --> 2085.76]  And when he comes again,
[2085.84 --> 2087.10]  he's establishing a kingdom
[2087.10 --> 2088.34]  of beauty,
[2089.20 --> 2090.14]  of restoration,
[2090.88 --> 2091.72]  of healing,
[2092.24 --> 2093.38]  of putting away the tears
[2093.38 --> 2094.84]  and making all things new.
[2095.08 --> 2096.86]  We celebrate that coming kingdom
[2096.86 --> 2097.74]  in this meal.
[2100.18 --> 2101.50]  The way we're going to do communion
[2101.50 --> 2102.04]  this morning
[2102.04 --> 2104.22]  is what I call family style.
[2104.42 --> 2105.86]  Candy told me it was crazy communion
[2105.86 --> 2106.88]  because it's a bit chaotic
[2106.88 --> 2107.94]  and we embrace it.
[2108.58 --> 2110.44]  There's larger portions of bread,
[2110.90 --> 2112.26]  cups of juice for everybody.
[2112.84 --> 2113.88]  And the way you do it
[2113.88 --> 2114.82]  is you grab as much bread
[2114.82 --> 2116.18]  as you want for your family,
[2116.54 --> 2117.48]  for those around you,
[2117.50 --> 2118.72]  and you can eat it slowly
[2118.72 --> 2119.94]  and enjoy it.
[2120.30 --> 2121.08]  And what we're going to do
[2121.08 --> 2121.98]  during communion
[2121.98 --> 2123.76]  is invite people to share
[2123.76 --> 2126.04]  their words of gratitude to God.
[2126.86 --> 2128.60]  Perhaps you come to this service
[2128.60 --> 2130.60]  with a sense of thanking him
[2130.60 --> 2132.22]  for the way he's taking care
[2132.22 --> 2132.80]  of your health
[2132.80 --> 2133.82]  and your body this year.
[2134.26 --> 2135.38]  Or providing you
[2135.38 --> 2136.38]  with a new child
[2136.38 --> 2137.38]  or a new job
[2137.38 --> 2138.82]  or the way you've just seen
[2138.82 --> 2139.36]  his goodness.
[2139.60 --> 2140.80]  This is the time in the service
[2140.80 --> 2141.60]  where we're just going to say,
[2141.70 --> 2142.48]  come up to the mic,
[2143.30 --> 2144.74]  share those words of gratitude
[2144.74 --> 2145.84]  with the body of Christ
[2145.84 --> 2147.68]  and allow us to join in
[2147.68 --> 2149.16]  thanksgiving together
[2149.16 --> 2150.44]  for all the ways
[2150.44 --> 2151.30]  that God has shown
[2151.30 --> 2152.44]  his goodness to us.
[2153.04 --> 2154.22]  So you can come up,
[2154.52 --> 2155.14]  grab the bread,
[2155.26 --> 2155.92]  grab the juice,
[2155.92 --> 2157.08]  go back to your seats
[2157.08 --> 2158.46]  and enjoy it with your families
[2158.46 --> 2159.56]  or whoever you're with.
[2160.08 --> 2160.96]  During that time,
[2161.04 --> 2161.74]  we'll have the worship team
[2161.74 --> 2162.62]  playing in the background.
[2163.22 --> 2164.06]  Brad's going to lead us
[2164.06 --> 2164.82]  in community prayer
[2164.82 --> 2165.76]  and after that,
[2165.86 --> 2166.56]  come up to the mic
[2166.56 --> 2167.44]  as you feel led,
[2167.98 --> 2169.12]  share your words of gratitude
[2169.12 --> 2170.14]  and we will be a community
[2170.14 --> 2171.30]  of celebration together.
[2172.40 --> 2173.98]  The invitation is this.
[2175.06 --> 2176.24]  If you believe
[2176.24 --> 2177.18]  that Jesus Christ
[2177.18 --> 2178.90]  is Lord, Savior, and life,
[2179.58 --> 2180.26]  if you believe
[2180.26 --> 2181.48]  that salvation is found
[2181.48 --> 2182.68]  in him and him alone,
[2183.16 --> 2185.60]  this meal is for you.
[2186.38 --> 2188.74]  This is the body of Christ
[2188.74 --> 2190.32]  to nourish us,
[2190.64 --> 2191.38]  the body of Christ.
[2191.46 --> 2192.70]  So allow this meal
[2192.70 --> 2194.04]  to nourish us
[2194.04 --> 2194.78]  in his life
[2194.78 --> 2195.72]  this morning.
[2196.86 --> 2197.96]  Come up to any one
[2197.96 --> 2198.44]  of the tables
[2198.44 --> 2199.20]  and let's enjoy
[2199.20 --> 2199.94]  this meal together.
[2199.94 --> 2202.40]  This clapping is for you.
[2202.40 --> 2232.38]  Thank you.
[2232.40 --> 2262.38]  Thank you.
[2262.40 --> 2292.38]  Thank you.
[2292.40 --> 2322.38]  Thank you.
[2322.40 --> 2352.38]  Thank you.
[2352.40 --> 2382.38]  Thank you.
[2382.40 --> 2412.38]  Thank you.
[2412.40 --> 2442.38]  Thank you.
[2442.78 --> 2448.08]  As customary, after the service, there will be prayer available for you.
[2448.48 --> 2451.14]  Somebody will be available, standing over by the pumpkins.
[2451.84 --> 2459.58]  If something you need prayer about, just meet up with them, and you can pray to the Lord by the gourd, I guess is what it is.
[2459.58 --> 2489.56]  I was reluctant to tell you.
[2489.56 --> 2519.54]  Thank you, Lord, hear us.
[2519.56 --> 2526.70]  How can we begin to do this, how can we begin to do this, how can we begin to show our thankfulness?
[2527.30 --> 2529.72]  There is no gift of appreciation you desire.
[2529.88 --> 2533.60]  There is nothing we can do except this gift of salvation freely.
[2533.60 --> 2544.68]  Help us, Lord, Lord, Lord, learn what it means to learn, Lord, and let's pray with you, Lord, let's pray for us, Lord, let's pray for you.
[2544.68 --> 2544.88]  Let's pray for us.
[2544.88 --> 2545.68]  Let's pray for you.
[2545.68 --> 2547.74]  Let us all receive this gift like children.
[2549.22 --> 2551.58]  Lord, for the days when we struggle to feel thankful,
[2551.58 --> 2554.64]  we get distracted by all the noise of this world
[2554.64 --> 2558.54]  and feel like we're plagued sometimes with negative news and issues.
[2559.04 --> 2561.64]  And through all this, we must always turn to you and lean on you.
[2562.94 --> 2565.06]  So, Lord, we lift up our brothers Joe and Chris
[2565.06 --> 2567.44]  after the loss of their dear mother.
[2568.32 --> 2570.42]  May their thoughts and hearts be filled with thankfulness
[2570.42 --> 2572.12]  and love for the gift that she was to them.
[2572.12 --> 2575.68]  We will continually pray for Nell and for Nana
[2575.68 --> 2577.76]  as they're still dealing with their health issues.
[2578.14 --> 2579.92]  We pray for recovery, for healing,
[2580.34 --> 2582.70]  and for you to continue to be the cornerstones in their lives.
[2584.06 --> 2587.52]  We're so thankful for the time we live with medicine and science
[2587.52 --> 2590.14]  that could help provide treatments and prescriptions to the sick.
[2591.12 --> 2594.16]  What was at one point in time to be considered a hopeless situation
[2594.16 --> 2595.88]  is now something that has a lot of hope.
[2597.42 --> 2601.32]  You are at work in so many areas of your creation around the world.
[2602.12 --> 2603.98]  And often it's veiled by all this stuff.
[2604.96 --> 2605.90]  And open our eyes, Lord.
[2606.00 --> 2608.20]  Remind us of all the goodness that is around us.
[2609.20 --> 2612.72]  We are thankful that we get to worship here in relative safety,
[2612.72 --> 2616.28]  that we can gather here in your house freely to sing songs of praise to you,
[2616.68 --> 2620.74]  to be a pillar in the community without fear of persecution or judgment.
[2620.74 --> 2625.60]  We pray with thankfulness for the many uses of this building,
[2626.38 --> 2631.00]  for the taut romp, story time, wind and tide, for the blood donation clinics,
[2631.40 --> 2633.92]  and even for being a polling station in the upcoming election.
[2635.00 --> 2636.52]  So, Lord, we pray for all of the candidates,
[2636.72 --> 2638.94]  that they have a chance to put on display their values.
[2639.66 --> 2642.90]  And we pray that they have their hearts focused on the people and their writings,
[2643.02 --> 2645.72]  and not just on selfish gain, titles, or status.
[2645.72 --> 2650.28]  Because with leadership comes higher responsibility and expectations,
[2650.56 --> 2652.28]  so we pray for all the leaders in our lives,
[2652.60 --> 2656.70]  not just in politics, but in our workplaces, our schools, and our churches.
[2658.02 --> 2662.56]  So, Lord, we're thankful for Pastor Dave as he led us through your word.
[2663.28 --> 2666.40]  We're thankful for his words that were filled with your truth and grace
[2666.40 --> 2668.28]  and pointed us towards you.
[2669.30 --> 2672.46]  We ask all this and give all this thanks to your faith in you and your son, Jesus Christ.
[2672.46 --> 2674.80]  In his name we pray. Amen.
[2682.46 --> 2685.46]  If anybody has anything they want to share, please come up to the microphone.
[2685.62 --> 2686.00]  Don't be shy.
[2702.46 --> 2713.16]  Hi, everyone.
[2713.88 --> 2717.22]  I just wanted to talk about something that happened this week with my daughter.
[2718.50 --> 2720.62]  Tuesday morning at school drop-off,
[2721.14 --> 2723.06]  she was getting onto the sidewalk,
[2723.30 --> 2725.26]  and a car who was trying to park behind us
[2725.26 --> 2728.10]  confused their brake for their gas pedal
[2728.10 --> 2734.76]  and went right up into the sidewalk where my daughter was just standing.
[2736.02 --> 2739.32]  And it was just such a miracle that everyone was okay.
[2740.10 --> 2744.20]  And I have a little video of her talking about how the angels pushed her out of the way.
[2745.00 --> 2749.16]  And I'm just so thankful to God that she's okay.
[2749.16 --> 2755.36]  And I was so confused about after it happened,
[2755.50 --> 2759.54]  like, God, now I have all this fear of leaving my house and living my life.
[2759.62 --> 2761.10]  I have three kids.
[2761.34 --> 2766.62]  And God just reminded me how he covers us and he protects us.
[2766.76 --> 2771.22]  And then after spiraling for like a few hours after the shock,
[2771.60 --> 2773.28]  God started to work on my heart.
[2773.28 --> 2778.36]  And he started to change my heart towards my motherhood,
[2778.56 --> 2780.24]  which was such a blessing,
[2780.40 --> 2784.08]  because I didn't even realize I had been walking in this kind of, like,
[2784.14 --> 2786.94]  survival mindset with my kids
[2786.94 --> 2790.14]  and not living in, like, peace and patience and love
[2790.14 --> 2792.12]  towards my kids and my family.
[2792.44 --> 2797.98]  And, yeah, I'm just so thankful for God's grace and mercy in our lives.
[2798.88 --> 2799.48]  Happy Thanksgiving.
[2799.48 --> 2799.66]  Thank you.
[2803.28 --> 2806.98]  Hi, my name is Cindy.
[2807.16 --> 2808.70]  Some of you know me, some of you don't.
[2810.28 --> 2813.44]  During this service, my mom kept coming to mind
[2813.44 --> 2820.40]  because she was a true example of being generous with very little.
[2821.04 --> 2822.34]  We didn't grow up with much,
[2822.34 --> 2827.06]  but she always made a point of helping others if she could,
[2827.38 --> 2830.84]  teaching us to be generous with whatever little we had.
[2830.84 --> 2836.64]  And, yeah, I'm just thankful for generosity
[2836.64 --> 2841.56]  just when you have nothing to be generous with.
[2841.56 --> 2843.58]  I love it.
[2843.58 --> 2844.94]  I love it.
[2845.02 --> 2845.72]  Let's do it.
[2845.82 --> 2846.22]  Thank you so much.
[2846.22 --> 2866.22]  Hi, my name is Nicole and this is my daughter Jada.
[2867.02 --> 2869.56]  We're just thankful for the Hope Community Church.
[2869.56 --> 2871.46]  We love that it's close to home.
[2871.46 --> 2876.46]  And I'm not a perfect person, but I do make mistakes.
[2876.46 --> 2880.46]  And I'm just so thankful for Jesus.
[2880.46 --> 2882.46]  He brings me back every time.
[2882.46 --> 2886.46]  And raising a family on my own isn't easy,
[2886.46 --> 2892.46]  but like the lady said, prior to me being generous is something that I love to do.
[2892.46 --> 2897.46]  Even when we don't have a lot, I always say, or I learned this as a child,
[2897.46 --> 2899.46]  when you have enough for three, you have enough for four.
[2899.46 --> 2902.46]  When you have enough for four, you have enough for five.
[2902.46 --> 2907.46]  So I always try to give as much as I can.
[2907.46 --> 2911.46]  And I'm just really thankful to God and Happy Thanksgiving.
[2911.46 --> 2915.46]  And I'm thankful for Pastor Dave and Sid and the Hope Community Church.
[2915.46 --> 2916.46]  Thank you.
[2916.46 --> 2918.46]  We love you guys.
[2918.46 --> 2920.46]  And this is Jada.
[2920.46 --> 2942.46]  Good morning.
[2942.46 --> 2943.46]  My name is Shilpa.
[2943.46 --> 2949.46]  And quite young, my parents have said to me, which has been quite ingrained,
[2949.46 --> 2954.46]  is when there is an opportunity to give thanks to the Lord, no matter who it is in front of,
[2954.46 --> 2956.46]  never miss that opportunity.
[2956.46 --> 2962.46]  And so when Pastor Dave said that today, it was like, oh, boy, I have to step up.
[2962.46 --> 2965.46]  And it was in me to give praise to God.
[2965.46 --> 2976.46]  Last year, around this time, my son could not, he could speak, but not speak and communicate as he wanted to.
[2976.46 --> 2985.46]  And the prayers that we've had over the years has been, God, how you've led Moses to speak.
[2985.46 --> 2988.46]  I hope you can do the same for my son.
[2988.46 --> 2994.46]  And so grateful this Thanksgiving, how he's able to communicate, how he's able to speak,
[2994.46 --> 2999.46]  how he's able to have a conversation, hold a conversation with his peers.
[2999.46 --> 3001.46]  And I give thanks to God.
[3001.46 --> 3009.46]  So one other thing that I would, it would be a miss to not give thanks to is this church
[3009.46 --> 3017.46]  and my small group community who have really supported and how we've done life together this past year.
[3017.46 --> 3022.46]  And I'm so grateful for my small group community as well and this wonderful church.
[3024.46 --> 3027.46]  Thank you.
[3027.46 --> 3042.46]  Good morning, church.
[3042.46 --> 3044.46]  My name's Adam Horaskamp.
[3044.46 --> 3046.46]  I'm just really grateful.
[3046.46 --> 3049.46]  Like I'm a, I'm a recovering addict.
[3049.46 --> 3053.46]  And I'm just really, really grateful to be sober today.
[3053.46 --> 3066.46]  And, uh, I'd like to thank this church for welcoming me.
[3066.46 --> 3067.46]  Thank you very much.
[3067.46 --> 3068.46]  Thank you.
[3068.46 --> 3071.46]  Thank you very much.
[3071.46 --> 3073.46]  You're جمن.
[3073.46 --> 3076.46]  Thank you, Gilbert.
[3076.46 --> 3106.44]  Thank you.
[3106.46 --> 3136.44]  Thank you.
[3136.46 --> 3138.46]  Thank you.
[3166.46 --> 3168.46]  Thank you.
[3168.46 --> 3170.46]  Thank you.
[3196.46 --> 3198.46]  Thank you.
[3198.46 --> 3200.46]  Thank you.
[3200.46 --> 3202.46]  Thank you.
[3202.46 --> 3209.46]  Praise forever to the King of kings.
[3209.46 --> 3211.46]  Thank you.
[3239.46 --> 3241.46]  Thank you.
[3241.46 --> 3243.46]  Thank you.
[3243.46 --> 3245.46]  Thank you.
[3245.46 --> 3247.46]  Thank you.
[3247.46 --> 3249.46]  Thank you.
[3249.46 --> 3253.46]  Praise the Father.
[3253.46 --> 3256.46]  Praise the Son.
[3256.46 --> 3260.46]  Praise the Spirit.
[3260.46 --> 3263.46]  Three in one.
[3263.46 --> 3269.46]  God of glory, majesty.
[3269.46 --> 3275.46]  Praise forever to the King of kings.
[3275.46 --> 3283.46]  The King of kings.
[3283.46 --> 3290.46]  In the morning that you rose, all of heaven held its breath.
[3290.46 --> 3297.46]  Till that stone was moved for good, for the Lamb had conquered heaven.
[3297.46 --> 3304.46]  And the devils from their tombs, and the angels stood in awe.
[3304.46 --> 3310.46]  For the souls of all who come to the Father are restored.
[3310.46 --> 3312.46]  And the church.
[3312.46 --> 3315.46]  And the church of Christ was born.
[3315.46 --> 3318.46]  Let the Spirit lift the flame.
[3318.46 --> 3321.46]  Now this gospel truth of all.
[3321.46 --> 3325.46]  Shall not fear, shall not faint.
[3325.46 --> 3329.46]  By His blood and in His name.
[3329.46 --> 3332.46]  In His freedom I am free.
[3332.46 --> 3341.46]  For the love of Jesus Christ, who has resurrected me.
[3341.46 --> 3343.46]  Shall we sing one last time?
[3343.46 --> 3344.46]  We praise.
[3344.46 --> 3345.46]  Praise.
[3345.46 --> 3350.46]  Praise the Father.
[3350.46 --> 3353.46]  Praise the Son.
[3353.46 --> 3357.46]  Praise the Spirit.
[3357.46 --> 3360.46]  Three in one.
[3360.46 --> 3367.46]  God of glory, majesty.
[3367.46 --> 3374.46]  Praise forever to the King of kings.
[3374.46 --> 3383.46]  Praise forever to the King of kings.
[3383.46 --> 3384.46]  Praise the Lord.
[3384.46 --> 3385.46]  Praise the Lord.
[3385.46 --> 3386.46]  Praise the Lord.
[3386.46 --> 3390.46]  Praise the Lord.
[3390.46 --> 3391.46]  Praise the Lord.
[3391.46 --> 3392.46]  Praise the Lord.
[3392.46 --> 3393.46]  Praise the Lord.
[3393.46 --> 3394.46]  Praise the Lord.
[3394.46 --> 3395.46]  Praise the Lord.
[3395.46 --> 3399.46]  Can I just say thank you so much for leading us in worship.
[3399.46 --> 3400.46]  What a gift.
[3400.46 --> 3402.46]  And thank you to our string string for joining us.
[3402.46 --> 3404.46]  Let's give a warm aware of applause for our worshipers.
[3404.46 --> 3413.52]  before we receive God's blessing I want to invite you to two things
[3413.52 --> 3418.10]  the first is as was said so well behind the microphone if you've got room for
[3418.10 --> 3422.30]  three you've got room for four it's Thanksgiving weekend you know of
[3422.30 --> 3426.24]  someone who might need a seat around your table so please invite them to
[3426.24 --> 3429.58]  join you for a meal so that we can enjoy the gift of Thanksgiving together
[3429.58 --> 3434.42]  and not alone but secondly I want to say a few words about money we've been
[3434.42 --> 3438.62]  talking about money during the sermon and I'm going to use this $100 bill as a
[3438.62 --> 3443.12]  very effective illustration a teacher of mine once said this too there's three
[3443.12 --> 3448.80]  things we say when we give number one we say thank you Lord for giving me
[3448.80 --> 3453.18]  everything I have you are so generous number two when you give to the church
[3453.18 --> 3457.10]  you're saying I want to get in on what the church is doing and there's a lot of
[3457.10 --> 3460.82]  good stuff we are doing one of the things that you can give to this week is our
[3460.82 --> 3464.40]  care fund which we use to meet the needs of people in our city and in our church
[3464.40 --> 3469.54]  in a whole variety of ways but thirdly and maybe this is what we need to hear
[3469.54 --> 3473.90]  the most when we give our money away freely and generously we're saying to our
[3473.90 --> 3482.54]  money you do not own me I belong to God in conversation with some dads about a
[3482.54 --> 3487.00]  month ago we are talking about the practice of tithing and I realized we're all
[3487.00 --> 3491.50]  admitting together that we desire to give we want to give and in fits and spurts we do
[3491.50 --> 3495.52]  give but it's not a regular habit and so what I've said to Linda who's our
[3495.52 --> 3499.38]  bookkeeper who's wonderful by the way and taking care of our books she is going
[3499.38 --> 3502.88]  to be at the giving station where the deacons are and I'm going to encourage
[3502.88 --> 3508.00]  you to ask Linda to show you how to make monthly giving a monthly practice you
[3508.00 --> 3511.34]  can do that through automatic giving you can do that on the church center app but I
[3511.34 --> 3514.96]  want to give the challenge out this morning make giving not just a one-time
[3514.96 --> 3519.16]  thing or a two-time thing but a monthly practice where we learn together to be
[3519.16 --> 3526.30]  generous as a church of Jesus Christ God has blessed us and he now sends us to
[3526.30 --> 3530.70]  be a blessing do you want to receive his blessing I invite you to hold your hands
[3530.70 --> 3534.02]  out to receive a blessing that comes not from me but from your generous heavenly
[3534.02 --> 3541.80]  father the Lord bless you and keep you the Lord make his face shine upon you and be
[3541.80 --> 3549.56]  gracious towards you the Lord turn his face towards you and give you his peace and
[3549.56 --> 3553.12]  together we say amen go in his peace
[3553.12 --> 3555.12]  you
