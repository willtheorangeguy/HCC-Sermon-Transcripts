[0.00 --> 7.96]  Good morning, Hope.
[14.82 --> 19.44]  Well, it's my privilege to be witnessing to God's Word as we cap off this year.
[20.32 --> 21.46]  And what a year it's been.
[22.00 --> 24.64]  I don't know about you, but thinking back on this year,
[25.38 --> 28.54]  it's been a year to remember.
[30.00 --> 35.18]  I really believe that one of the gifts that God created us with is the gift of memory.
[36.12 --> 40.36]  So we are created beings and we are made to remember.
[40.36 --> 43.66]  And this is part of our act of worship as well.
[44.42 --> 46.88]  When we share in the table at communion,
[47.32 --> 50.92]  we remember Jesus and what he did for us on the cross.
[51.54 --> 54.42]  Jesus said as he sat down with his disciples,
[55.32 --> 57.50]  do this in remembrance of me.
[58.04 --> 58.84]  So we remember.
[58.84 --> 61.54]  It's our act of worship to remember.
[62.46 --> 64.38]  And so through this act of remembering,
[64.82 --> 69.08]  we get to grow and deepen our relationship with God and with one another.
[69.84 --> 73.70]  And that's the reason that I chose our text from the Gospel of Luke this morning.
[74.40 --> 77.44]  Because for me personally, reflecting on this year,
[77.80 --> 80.48]  it was the beginning of my official calling into ministry.
[80.48 --> 83.90]  And this calling that I've sensed,
[84.10 --> 86.14]  it's been a long time coming.
[86.42 --> 90.10]  Because I've sensed this sort of calling into ministry
[90.10 --> 93.08]  and I've wrestled with it since 2009, I would say,
[93.40 --> 94.84]  when I entered Bible college.
[95.60 --> 99.18]  And this year was the year where I finally finished my studies
[99.18 --> 102.32]  and did the exam and then was finally ordained.
[102.82 --> 105.28]  And then as some of you pointed out to me,
[105.36 --> 106.70]  now I'm a real pastor.
[107.34 --> 108.50]  I used to be a fake one.
[108.60 --> 109.68]  Now you're a real one.
[109.68 --> 115.76]  And so this year for me has sort of forced me to remember where I was,
[116.76 --> 117.42]  fake pastor,
[117.70 --> 118.96]  and then where I am now,
[119.30 --> 120.14]  a real pastor.
[120.64 --> 121.72]  But in all seriousness,
[122.10 --> 124.42]  it forces us to recognize
[124.42 --> 126.70]  how God has led us through
[126.70 --> 129.38]  all the ups and downs that we go through in our lives.
[129.38 --> 131.50]  In our Christian journeys as well,
[131.86 --> 134.90]  we remember how God is faithful,
[135.04 --> 138.38]  even though we many times are faithless.
[139.08 --> 141.80]  Our act of worship through remembering.
[142.40 --> 143.80]  And so with that in mind,
[143.96 --> 146.44]  I want to invite you to open up to Luke 4.
[146.82 --> 148.50]  This is the beginning of Jesus
[148.50 --> 150.68]  and his adult ministry
[150.68 --> 153.28]  when he came down for us.
[153.40 --> 154.64]  And so if you have your Bibles,
[154.82 --> 156.26]  your phones are on the screen,
[156.78 --> 158.52]  Luke 4 should be available for you.
[159.38 --> 162.22]  And we will start reading from verse 14.
[165.22 --> 167.04]  From verse 14 we read,
[167.16 --> 168.84]  Jesus returned to Galilee
[168.84 --> 171.24]  in the power of the Spirit.
[172.14 --> 174.34]  And news about him spread through the whole countryside.
[174.88 --> 176.40]  He was teaching in their synagogues
[176.40 --> 177.42]  and everyone praised him.
[177.88 --> 180.18]  He went to Nazareth where he had been brought up.
[180.18 --> 181.84]  And on the Sabbath day,
[181.96 --> 184.50]  he went into the synagogue as was his custom.
[185.12 --> 186.22]  He stood up to read
[186.22 --> 189.24]  and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him.
[189.38 --> 190.38]  On rolling it,
[190.44 --> 191.96]  he found the place where it is written.
[192.96 --> 195.14]  The Spirit of the Lord is on me
[195.14 --> 196.92]  because he has anointed me
[196.92 --> 199.00]  to proclaim good news to the poor.
[199.74 --> 201.72]  He has sent me to proclaim freedom
[201.72 --> 203.36]  for the prisoners
[203.36 --> 205.62]  and recovery of sight for the blind,
[205.98 --> 207.14]  to set the oppressed,
[207.40 --> 209.56]  again, freedom, free,
[210.22 --> 211.72]  to set the oppressed free,
[211.72 --> 214.82]  to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.
[215.94 --> 217.40]  Then he rolled up the scroll,
[217.54 --> 218.56]  gave it back to the attendant,
[218.68 --> 219.34]  and sat down.
[219.54 --> 221.54]  And the eyes of everyone in the synagogue
[221.54 --> 222.56]  were fastened on him.
[223.18 --> 224.60]  He began by saying to them,
[225.30 --> 228.72]  Today, this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.
[230.02 --> 230.38]  Amen.
[230.38 --> 230.50]  Amen.
[232.44 --> 233.94]  And so, if you've been with us
[233.94 --> 235.12]  for the last number of weeks,
[235.44 --> 237.14]  during what we call in our church,
[237.36 --> 238.10]  or in the church,
[238.24 --> 239.48]  in Christian tradition,
[239.64 --> 241.02]  we call it the Advent season,
[241.32 --> 242.24]  a season of waiting.
[242.74 --> 243.68]  And in that season,
[243.80 --> 245.84]  we reflected on the birth of our Savior
[245.84 --> 247.22]  through the songs that we looked at
[247.22 --> 248.30]  in the Gospel of Luke.
[248.74 --> 250.02]  So the birth narrative
[250.02 --> 251.32]  in the Gospel of Luke
[251.32 --> 252.56]  portrays for us
[252.56 --> 254.52]  what we might expect
[254.52 --> 256.18]  of God's gracious visitation.
[256.44 --> 257.06]  So the what,
[257.14 --> 258.06]  the content of it,
[258.06 --> 259.36]  why did Jesus come?
[259.88 --> 261.90]  The what of it is the good news
[261.90 --> 264.82]  of the fulfillment of God's redemptive plans
[264.82 --> 265.48]  for the world.
[266.34 --> 268.56]  The coming of the long-awaited Messiah,
[268.98 --> 270.26]  the anointed one of God,
[270.42 --> 272.64]  to defeat the curse of sin once and for all.
[273.28 --> 275.94]  That is the what of Jesus
[275.94 --> 278.90]  and what Christmas is really about.
[279.36 --> 281.48]  So that's the what that we got to witness to
[281.48 --> 283.00]  in the birth narratives.
[283.62 --> 285.20]  And now, as we see Jesus
[285.20 --> 286.68]  beginning his adult ministry
[286.68 --> 288.20]  in today's Luke text,
[288.58 --> 291.06]  we get to see how God's plan
[291.06 --> 292.44]  of redemption would be achieved.
[293.40 --> 295.76]  And this is how Jesus starts his ministry,
[296.50 --> 298.56]  which I want to suggest for us this morning.
[298.62 --> 300.88]  As we hear God's word for us,
[301.58 --> 303.90]  it's the same calling that we have,
[303.98 --> 305.30]  just as Jesus was called,
[305.60 --> 307.94]  as he was anointed by God's Holy Spirit
[307.94 --> 311.52]  to bring the Lord's,
[312.00 --> 314.34]  the ear of the Lord's favor to us
[314.34 --> 315.04]  here on earth.
[316.22 --> 317.34]  And so simply put,
[317.42 --> 318.52]  the text that we read,
[318.96 --> 321.20]  the proclamation that Jesus makes in Luke 4,
[321.58 --> 323.06]  gives us a picture of Jesus
[323.06 --> 324.48]  through the power and guidance
[324.48 --> 325.22]  of the Holy Spirit,
[325.54 --> 327.38]  bringing God's kingdom on earth
[327.38 --> 330.04]  through his life, word, and deed.
[330.58 --> 331.82]  Through his life,
[332.24 --> 333.64]  his words, and his deeds.
[334.46 --> 335.86]  And this is God initiating
[335.86 --> 336.96]  the fullness of his plan,
[337.06 --> 338.10]  the grand narrative
[338.10 --> 339.80]  of the whole biblical story.
[340.18 --> 341.04]  That's our faith.
[341.36 --> 342.62]  That's the whole story
[342.62 --> 345.64]  of how God comes to save the world
[345.64 --> 347.40]  from its brokenness and sin.
[348.60 --> 351.86]  And this plan includes us as well.
[353.48 --> 354.86]  Isn't that good news for us?
[355.70 --> 357.32]  God's redemptive plans
[357.32 --> 358.54]  for the whole world
[358.54 --> 360.34]  includes you and me.
[360.34 --> 362.90]  And so,
[363.68 --> 364.70]  beyond that,
[364.78 --> 365.74]  the good news for us
[365.74 --> 367.56]  as God invites us into his family,
[368.26 --> 370.12]  even through our life,
[370.34 --> 371.10]  word, and deed,
[372.16 --> 373.82]  even in all its shortcomings
[373.82 --> 374.66]  and brokenness,
[374.68 --> 375.98]  and there is plenty of that,
[376.44 --> 378.16]  God still invites us
[378.16 --> 379.36]  and uses us
[379.36 --> 380.88]  to bring about his kingdom,
[381.32 --> 382.78]  the year of the Lord's favor.
[383.02 --> 384.80]  And we get to proclaim that with him.
[384.80 --> 388.24]  We too,
[388.52 --> 389.22]  by the empowering
[389.22 --> 390.46]  of God's Holy Spirit,
[390.96 --> 392.70]  are freed from depravity,
[393.00 --> 393.42]  oppression,
[393.78 --> 394.38]  and blindness
[394.38 --> 395.60]  through Jesus our Savior.
[396.60 --> 396.92]  And so,
[396.98 --> 397.76]  that's the proclamation
[397.76 --> 398.82]  that Jesus makes
[398.82 --> 400.26]  about the year of the Lord's favor
[400.26 --> 401.96]  that we get to make with him.
[402.18 --> 403.76]  And as we enter this new year,
[403.96 --> 404.84]  that's the encouragement
[404.84 --> 406.12]  that I want to leave us with.
[406.64 --> 408.84]  As we head into a new year,
[409.28 --> 410.48]  this year also,
[410.80 --> 411.62]  we give to God
[411.62 --> 412.70]  because this year
[412.70 --> 414.26]  is also a year
[414.26 --> 415.28]  of the Lord's favor.
[415.74 --> 417.18]  God's kingdom is here.
[417.50 --> 418.84]  It is all around us.
[419.00 --> 420.34]  And we live in that.
[421.94 --> 422.34]  And so,
[422.54 --> 423.16]  the proclamation
[423.16 --> 424.64]  that Jesus preaches from,
[425.10 --> 426.24]  that we got to look at
[426.24 --> 427.82]  from Luke chapter 4,
[428.46 --> 429.36]  is from the book.
[429.68 --> 430.48]  And we say book
[430.48 --> 431.26]  because we're so used
[431.26 --> 432.16]  to just reading books.
[432.68 --> 434.24]  He was actually handed a scroll.
[434.98 --> 436.14]  And why I emphasize this
[436.14 --> 436.56]  is because
[436.56 --> 437.66]  after he was handed
[437.66 --> 438.90]  the scroll of Isaiah,
[439.14 --> 440.28]  he unrolled it
[440.28 --> 442.70]  and he found the exact spot
[442.70 --> 443.48]  where he wanted
[443.48 --> 444.24]  to preach from.
[445.08 --> 446.76]  They had no chapter numbers,
[446.88 --> 447.74]  no page numbers.
[447.94 --> 448.72]  It was just a big,
[448.92 --> 449.80]  long scroll.
[450.60 --> 451.88]  And Jesus knew exactly
[451.88 --> 452.66]  where he was going
[452.66 --> 453.36]  to read from.
[453.74 --> 455.22]  And what he reads is
[455.22 --> 456.94]  that the Spirit of the Lord
[456.94 --> 457.70]  is on me
[457.70 --> 459.62]  to proclaim good news
[459.62 --> 460.50]  for the poor,
[460.84 --> 461.38]  the oppressed,
[461.56 --> 462.16]  the blind,
[462.40 --> 463.92]  because the year
[463.92 --> 465.14]  of the Lord's favor
[465.14 --> 466.36]  is fulfilled
[466.36 --> 467.20]  in your hearing.
[470.28 --> 471.50]  The Old Testament prophecy
[471.50 --> 472.66]  that Jesus reads from
[472.66 --> 474.30]  is actually from Isaiah 61
[474.30 --> 475.82]  and actually even parts of 58.
[476.44 --> 477.82]  And it captures the vision
[477.82 --> 478.50]  of the year
[478.50 --> 479.42]  of the Lord's favor,
[479.76 --> 480.70]  which is a reference
[480.70 --> 481.78]  to the year of Jubilee,
[481.92 --> 482.20]  actually.
[482.86 --> 484.04]  This year of Jubilee
[484.04 --> 484.82]  is actually,
[485.28 --> 486.80]  it's a part of God's law
[486.80 --> 488.82]  in the book of Leviticus.
[489.02 --> 489.84]  So it's part of the first
[489.84 --> 491.04]  five books of the Bible
[491.04 --> 491.76]  called the Torah.
[491.92 --> 492.46]  It's the law.
[492.86 --> 494.32]  And part of God's law
[494.32 --> 495.70]  and command was
[495.70 --> 497.58]  that on the 50th year,
[497.92 --> 499.38]  seven times seven is 49,
[499.38 --> 500.48]  right?
[500.76 --> 501.06]  Yes.
[501.52 --> 502.94]  And then on the 50th year,
[503.08 --> 504.16]  you don't do much math
[504.16 --> 505.12]  when you prepare a sermon.
[505.48 --> 507.46]  So on the 50th year,
[507.56 --> 509.24]  as a symbolic representation
[509.24 --> 510.78]  of God's kingdom on earth,
[511.00 --> 512.58]  God commanded
[512.58 --> 513.96]  the year of Jubilee
[513.96 --> 515.80]  where all the land
[515.80 --> 516.58]  and all the people
[516.58 --> 517.40]  that are in debt
[517.40 --> 520.04]  was supposed to be set free.
[520.22 --> 521.60]  It was a lawful command.
[522.26 --> 523.26]  Now was it followed?
[524.48 --> 525.64]  That's a different story.
[526.86 --> 527.28]  And so,
[527.28 --> 529.32]  the symbolic portrayal
[529.32 --> 530.04]  of the completion
[530.04 --> 531.48]  of God's kingdom,
[531.78 --> 532.70]  redemptive plans
[532.70 --> 533.32]  for the world,
[533.50 --> 534.60]  where the curse of sin
[534.60 --> 536.46]  is entirely reversed.
[537.24 --> 538.02]  It's shalom,
[538.56 --> 539.42]  the Hebrew word,
[540.02 --> 541.34]  the image of perfection
[541.34 --> 542.02]  and wholeness.
[542.32 --> 543.64]  And this is what Jesus
[543.64 --> 544.64]  is preaching on.
[545.06 --> 545.94]  That's the text
[545.94 --> 547.10]  that he unrolls,
[547.36 --> 547.82]  picks out,
[547.86 --> 548.30]  and he says,
[548.38 --> 548.84]  it's here.
[549.66 --> 550.62]  In other gospels,
[550.70 --> 551.58]  obviously we hear it
[551.58 --> 552.42]  here in different words.
[552.80 --> 553.68]  When Jesus starts
[553.68 --> 554.20]  his ministry
[554.20 --> 555.62]  in the other gospels,
[555.62 --> 556.58]  he just simply says,
[556.70 --> 557.02]  repent,
[557.52 --> 558.84]  for the kingdom of God
[558.84 --> 559.42]  is here,
[559.70 --> 560.28]  is near.
[561.18 --> 561.74]  Here,
[561.98 --> 563.08]  in the gospel of Luke,
[563.60 --> 564.52]  Jesus points out
[564.52 --> 565.98]  from the prophet Isaiah
[565.98 --> 566.84]  and he says,
[566.94 --> 568.36]  the year of the Lord's favor
[568.36 --> 569.20]  is fulfilled
[569.20 --> 570.34]  upon your hearing.
[570.98 --> 572.38]  And it is the release,
[572.58 --> 573.02]  the freedom
[573.02 --> 574.18]  of captives,
[574.66 --> 575.04]  prisoners,
[575.32 --> 576.24]  the blind receive
[576.24 --> 576.84]  their sight.
[577.84 --> 578.62]  And the poor
[578.62 --> 579.98]  are comforted
[579.98 --> 580.90]  because they know
[580.90 --> 582.84]  now God is here
[582.84 --> 585.24]  in the flesh.
[585.76 --> 586.20]  In Jesus,
[586.34 --> 587.66]  he's dwelling with us.
[588.66 --> 589.36]  And so what Jesus
[589.36 --> 590.12]  is preaching,
[591.12 --> 592.40]  this is what he's
[592.40 --> 593.24]  going to live out.
[593.74 --> 595.22]  The how of God's,
[595.22 --> 596.52]  how God's kingdom
[596.52 --> 597.60]  is established
[597.60 --> 598.34]  on earth.
[599.10 --> 599.58]  And so,
[599.92 --> 600.50]  in a nutshell,
[601.14 --> 601.96]  this is what Jesus'
[602.20 --> 603.06]  ministry looks like
[603.06 --> 603.54]  on earth.
[604.56 --> 604.88]  Jesus,
[605.06 --> 606.14]  anointed with God's
[606.14 --> 606.80]  Holy Spirit,
[606.98 --> 607.92]  invites the poor,
[608.20 --> 609.14]  invites the prisoners,
[609.14 --> 610.22]  invites the blind,
[610.54 --> 611.54]  the outsiders,
[611.94 --> 612.46]  the sinners,
[612.70 --> 614.48]  into the family of God.
[615.26 --> 615.58]  How?
[616.00 --> 616.32]  Again,
[616.72 --> 617.62]  through his life,
[617.76 --> 618.44]  word, and deed,
[619.34 --> 620.64]  rooted in the love of God,
[620.84 --> 621.98]  he invites sinners,
[622.38 --> 622.88]  outsiders,
[623.14 --> 624.38]  into his family.
[625.74 --> 626.22]  And so,
[626.30 --> 626.94]  he's preaching,
[627.12 --> 627.36]  again,
[627.48 --> 628.18]  he's preaching
[628.18 --> 629.32]  what he's going
[629.32 --> 630.20]  to be living out.
[630.90 --> 632.08]  And this is a key
[632.08 --> 633.00]  takeaway for us
[633.00 --> 633.56]  here today.
[634.08 --> 635.16]  As Christians,
[635.72 --> 636.58]  our faith,
[636.88 --> 637.94]  and being a Christian,
[638.12 --> 638.94]  being a follower
[638.94 --> 639.72]  of Christ,
[639.90 --> 640.98]  is not just about
[640.98 --> 641.70]  head knowledge.
[642.70 --> 643.74]  It's not just about
[643.74 --> 644.94]  knowing and believing
[644.94 --> 645.72]  in a collection
[645.72 --> 647.32]  of religious information
[647.32 --> 648.02]  and ideas
[648.02 --> 649.08]  about some sort of deity.
[650.40 --> 651.30]  Our identity
[651.30 --> 652.04]  as Christians
[652.04 --> 653.52]  is to follow him
[653.52 --> 655.00]  with our whole lives,
[655.20 --> 657.14]  not just with our minds.
[658.90 --> 660.10]  And I don't know
[660.10 --> 660.72]  if you've gotten,
[661.16 --> 662.24]  if you got the chance
[662.24 --> 662.78]  to listen to
[662.78 --> 663.58]  Caden's testimony
[663.58 --> 664.46]  that we recorded
[664.46 --> 665.02]  on podcast,
[665.24 --> 666.36]  so for his baptism.
[666.70 --> 667.76]  We did a separate recording
[667.76 --> 668.54]  of his testimony.
[669.14 --> 670.20]  And part of his testimony
[670.20 --> 671.16]  that stuck out to me
[671.16 --> 671.44]  was,
[671.52 --> 672.08]  we asked him,
[672.40 --> 673.20]  what would you say
[673.20 --> 673.96]  to a new believer?
[674.36 --> 675.28]  What would be your word
[675.28 --> 675.86]  of encouragement
[675.86 --> 676.66]  for somebody who's
[676.66 --> 677.58]  struggling with their faith,
[677.90 --> 678.98]  wanting to know God,
[679.04 --> 680.28]  but don't know where to start?
[680.48 --> 681.18]  What would you say?
[681.78 --> 683.12]  And his main encouragement
[683.12 --> 683.70]  was,
[684.16 --> 684.36]  well,
[684.44 --> 685.34]  if you're going to believe,
[685.44 --> 686.34]  you've got to go all in.
[687.00 --> 688.42]  You can't just dip your toe
[688.42 --> 688.88]  and think,
[689.06 --> 689.26]  oh,
[689.34 --> 690.26]  how come it's not working
[690.26 --> 690.68]  for me?
[690.68 --> 693.46]  Because it's just
[693.46 --> 694.98]  not quite right.
[695.94 --> 697.30]  And it's not the same
[697.30 --> 698.56]  if you're just thinking,
[699.02 --> 699.30]  huh,
[699.68 --> 700.22]  Christianity,
[700.76 --> 701.40]  that religion,
[701.60 --> 702.32]  I'm not sure.
[702.90 --> 704.74]  If it's just a head knowledge thing,
[705.30 --> 706.58]  it just doesn't fit.
[706.96 --> 708.52]  That is not our identity.
[708.60 --> 709.50]  It's not our calling.
[709.78 --> 710.86]  Because our identity
[710.86 --> 712.12]  as Christians,
[713.12 --> 714.16]  it's a devotion
[714.16 --> 715.62]  of our whole being
[715.62 --> 717.36]  to the good creator,
[717.52 --> 718.06]  the redeemer
[718.06 --> 718.70]  and restorer
[718.70 --> 719.52]  of all things.
[719.82 --> 721.16]  He is our only hope
[721.16 --> 722.06]  and we say,
[722.38 --> 723.40]  we are all in.
[725.00 --> 726.28]  So that's our calling.
[727.40 --> 728.14]  And so in
[728.14 --> 729.90]  our good savior sermon,
[730.64 --> 731.46]  Jesus names
[731.46 --> 733.04]  these three types of people.
[733.68 --> 734.12]  He says,
[734.26 --> 734.72]  the poor,
[735.22 --> 735.76]  the prisoners
[735.76 --> 736.74]  and the blind.
[737.92 --> 738.64]  Who is that?
[739.10 --> 739.62]  Who do you think
[739.62 --> 740.72]  Jesus is referring to?
[742.00 --> 742.38]  Oh yeah,
[742.50 --> 743.30]  people out there,
[743.80 --> 744.66]  outside the church.
[744.84 --> 745.34]  We're okay.
[746.04 --> 746.86]  We belong to him.
[746.92 --> 747.34]  We're holy.
[747.80 --> 748.30]  We're fine.
[748.70 --> 749.02]  No,
[749.06 --> 750.34]  it's the sinners out there.
[750.76 --> 751.12]  Right?
[752.98 --> 753.46]  No,
[753.54 --> 754.82]  when Jesus refers
[754.82 --> 755.42]  to the poor,
[755.52 --> 755.92]  the blind,
[755.96 --> 756.50]  and the prisoners,
[756.72 --> 757.80]  he's talking about us.
[758.48 --> 760.06]  He's talking about all of us.
[760.76 --> 761.42]  We have to,
[761.50 --> 761.68]  again,
[761.78 --> 762.40]  remember.
[763.10 --> 764.40]  We have to remember
[764.40 --> 765.74]  who we were,
[766.48 --> 767.84]  where we come from,
[768.04 --> 770.02]  and who we still struggle with.
[771.78 --> 772.64]  The sins
[772.64 --> 773.42]  and the brokenness
[773.42 --> 774.92]  that we still continue
[774.92 --> 775.74]  to wrestle with
[775.74 --> 777.08]  in our current
[777.08 --> 778.26]  day-to-day lives.
[779.20 --> 780.34]  That's who Jesus
[780.34 --> 780.92]  is calling.
[781.40 --> 782.44]  That includes us
[782.44 --> 782.96]  as sinners.
[784.20 --> 785.04]  At the beginning
[785.04 --> 785.54]  of his sermon,
[785.66 --> 786.20]  he says,
[786.34 --> 787.26]  the spirit of the Lord
[787.26 --> 787.70]  is on me
[787.70 --> 788.86]  because God,
[789.22 --> 790.26]  he has anointed me
[790.26 --> 791.46]  to proclaim good news
[791.46 --> 792.56]  to the poor.
[793.08 --> 793.96]  That's where we start,
[794.06 --> 794.48]  the poor.
[795.74 --> 797.00]  Not just socially
[797.00 --> 797.98]  or economically,
[798.12 --> 799.16]  as some might interpret,
[799.68 --> 800.82]  or in other circles,
[800.82 --> 801.86]  they just interpret
[801.86 --> 802.72]  this word poor
[802.72 --> 804.36]  as being spiritually poor.
[804.54 --> 805.16]  Or you don't have
[805.16 --> 805.68]  enough faith.
[805.80 --> 806.56]  You're not spiritually
[806.56 --> 807.70]  mature enough.
[808.30 --> 808.52]  Sure.
[808.90 --> 809.80]  But it includes
[809.80 --> 810.94]  all things.
[811.22 --> 811.56]  Again,
[811.70 --> 812.38]  it is about
[812.38 --> 813.58]  giving our whole lives
[813.58 --> 814.00]  to God.
[814.60 --> 815.20]  And so we were
[815.20 --> 816.74]  holistically poor,
[817.48 --> 818.14]  if you want to put it
[818.14 --> 818.54]  that way.
[818.78 --> 819.54]  One commentator
[819.54 --> 820.52]  puts it better than I do.
[820.82 --> 821.22]  He says,
[821.32 --> 821.84]  the poor,
[822.20 --> 823.74]  in the holistic sense
[823.74 --> 825.04]  of those who are
[825.04 --> 826.44]  for any of a number
[826.44 --> 827.26]  of social,
[827.58 --> 828.68]  religious reasons,
[829.08 --> 830.32]  relegated to positions
[830.32 --> 831.82]  outside the boundaries
[831.82 --> 832.78]  of God's people.
[833.26 --> 834.40]  That's who Jesus
[834.40 --> 835.38]  is referring to
[835.38 --> 836.22]  when he says,
[836.50 --> 837.48]  I've come to proclaim
[837.48 --> 838.70]  good news to the poor.
[840.16 --> 841.56]  Anyone relegated
[841.56 --> 842.10]  to positions
[842.10 --> 843.28]  outside the boundaries
[843.28 --> 844.12]  of God's people.
[844.66 --> 845.00]  And thus,
[845.10 --> 846.40]  what Jesus is doing
[846.40 --> 847.44]  by proclaiming
[847.44 --> 848.00]  the good news
[848.00 --> 848.50]  for the poor
[848.50 --> 849.84]  is that he is inviting
[849.84 --> 850.74]  even those
[850.74 --> 851.54]  that would have been
[851.54 --> 852.94]  viewed as outsiders.
[853.20 --> 854.40]  And he's inviting us in.
[855.68 --> 856.94]  Even me?
[859.06 --> 859.58]  Yes,
[859.74 --> 860.30]  even you.
[860.30 --> 862.06]  No matter where
[862.06 --> 862.62]  you've been.
[863.08 --> 863.38]  Really?
[864.18 --> 864.92]  Even through all
[864.92 --> 865.96]  my brokenness,
[866.08 --> 866.72]  my addictions,
[866.98 --> 867.84]  and my sins,
[868.46 --> 869.76]  God calls me
[869.76 --> 871.26]  and uses me
[871.26 --> 872.34]  to reflect his light
[872.34 --> 874.06]  and his year
[874.06 --> 875.06]  of the Lord's favor
[875.06 --> 875.84]  on earth,
[875.90 --> 876.38]  his kingdom?
[878.96 --> 880.06]  There is an element
[880.06 --> 880.62]  of humility
[880.62 --> 881.92]  as we wrestle with that,
[882.14 --> 883.22]  with that same question,
[883.28 --> 884.74]  which I do myself as well.
[885.36 --> 886.14]  Well, I'm a pastor
[886.14 --> 886.72]  and I should have
[886.72 --> 887.72]  everything put together.
[887.72 --> 890.88]  No, but I still struggle.
[892.04 --> 892.84]  What are the sins
[892.84 --> 893.72]  that I struggle with
[893.72 --> 894.68]  and what are the questions
[894.68 --> 895.26]  that the enemy
[895.26 --> 896.18]  tempts us with
[896.18 --> 897.90]  as I keep thinking
[897.90 --> 898.56]  to myself,
[898.96 --> 899.76]  do you think
[899.76 --> 900.76]  that you're good enough?
[901.64 --> 902.48]  Do you think
[902.48 --> 903.36]  you're holy enough
[903.36 --> 904.58]  to belong to God's people?
[906.30 --> 907.18]  We're not.
[907.94 --> 908.86]  I'm not.
[909.24 --> 910.24]  But God says
[910.24 --> 911.00]  by his grace
[911.00 --> 911.48]  and love
[911.48 --> 912.32]  that you are.
[912.32 --> 916.84]  This is the same
[916.84 --> 917.34]  proclamation
[917.34 --> 918.30]  for the blind.
[919.12 --> 920.36]  Yes, we are poor,
[920.84 --> 922.60]  but we are also blind.
[923.58 --> 924.40]  And that's why
[924.40 --> 925.14]  Jesus came
[925.14 --> 926.18]  to proclaim good news
[926.18 --> 926.92]  to the poor
[926.92 --> 927.84]  and the blind
[927.84 --> 928.72]  as we saw
[928.72 --> 929.76]  during the Advent season.
[930.02 --> 930.76]  In the song
[930.76 --> 932.20]  that Simeon sung
[932.20 --> 933.96]  in his praise to God,
[934.06 --> 935.36]  when he finally sees
[935.36 --> 936.38]  the baby Savior
[936.38 --> 939.08]  probably in his arms,
[939.58 --> 940.34]  he sings out
[940.34 --> 941.22]  this praise
[941.22 --> 942.06]  and he says,
[942.50 --> 943.36]  for my eyes
[943.36 --> 944.26]  have seen,
[944.70 --> 945.50]  I was blind,
[945.74 --> 947.00]  but now I have seen
[947.00 --> 947.76]  your salvation,
[948.08 --> 948.92]  which you have prepared
[948.92 --> 949.84]  in the sight
[949.84 --> 951.00]  of all nations,
[951.28 --> 952.48]  a light for revelation
[952.48 --> 953.58]  to the Gentiles,
[954.04 --> 955.22]  to foreigners,
[955.48 --> 955.98]  outsiders,
[956.56 --> 957.34]  and the glory
[957.34 --> 958.32]  of your people Israel.
[958.80 --> 960.06]  And then in John 1
[960.06 --> 960.70]  we read
[960.70 --> 961.80]  the true light.
[962.40 --> 963.08]  The true light
[963.08 --> 963.78]  that gives light
[963.78 --> 964.36]  to everyone
[964.36 --> 965.62]  was coming into the world.
[965.70 --> 966.36]  That's Jesus.
[966.88 --> 968.28]  The word became flesh
[968.28 --> 969.66]  and made his dwelling
[969.66 --> 970.60]  among us.
[971.22 --> 973.40]  We have now
[973.40 --> 974.46]  seen
[974.46 --> 975.90]  this glory,
[976.30 --> 976.68]  the glory
[976.68 --> 977.12]  of the one
[977.12 --> 977.72]  and only Son
[977.72 --> 978.86]  who came from the Father
[978.86 --> 980.00]  full of grace
[980.00 --> 981.22]  and truth.
[982.82 --> 983.72]  He has come
[983.72 --> 984.88]  so that we may see
[984.88 --> 985.72]  the true light
[985.72 --> 986.46]  of the world,
[986.70 --> 987.56]  the true salvation
[987.56 --> 988.42]  that can make us
[988.42 --> 989.06]  whole again.
[990.86 --> 991.38]  Restoration.
[991.76 --> 992.50]  And then lastly,
[992.76 --> 993.68]  he refers to
[993.68 --> 994.42]  the prisoners,
[994.94 --> 995.82]  the captives
[995.82 --> 996.84]  and the oppressed.
[996.96 --> 997.54]  And he says,
[997.94 --> 998.28]  freedom,
[998.68 --> 999.56]  I preach to you.
[999.56 --> 1001.06]  You are now free.
[1004.46 --> 1005.80]  Jesus' ministry
[1005.80 --> 1006.50]  of healing
[1006.50 --> 1008.54]  signifies wholeness.
[1009.82 --> 1011.02]  Freedom from both
[1011.02 --> 1012.14]  spiritual and
[1012.14 --> 1013.56]  social restrictions,
[1013.78 --> 1014.66]  whatever that may be.
[1015.24 --> 1016.72]  This is God's kingdom.
[1017.26 --> 1018.28]  This is the proclamation
[1018.28 --> 1018.86]  of the year
[1018.86 --> 1019.60]  of the Lord's favor.
[1020.08 --> 1020.68]  Shalom!
[1021.18 --> 1021.90]  It is here.
[1021.90 --> 1024.76]  And so,
[1024.90 --> 1025.60]  sisters and brothers
[1025.60 --> 1026.12]  of hope,
[1026.48 --> 1027.58]  this is the encouragement
[1027.58 --> 1029.08]  I want to charge us with
[1029.08 --> 1029.82]  as we head into
[1029.82 --> 1030.48]  this new year.
[1031.38 --> 1031.70]  Jesus,
[1032.00 --> 1032.68]  the true light,
[1032.76 --> 1033.28]  has come
[1033.28 --> 1034.08]  and he brings
[1034.08 --> 1034.76]  good news
[1034.76 --> 1035.32]  of healing,
[1035.76 --> 1036.12]  restoration,
[1036.46 --> 1037.06]  and freedom.
[1038.18 --> 1040.06]  And as a freed people,
[1040.18 --> 1041.60]  we are a freed people,
[1042.28 --> 1043.80]  we get to proclaim
[1043.80 --> 1044.96]  the year of the Lord's favor
[1044.96 --> 1046.50]  and reflect that light
[1046.50 --> 1047.30]  to the world
[1047.30 --> 1048.26]  that is in darkness.
[1048.26 --> 1050.60]  because the poor,
[1050.76 --> 1051.32]  the oppressed,
[1051.52 --> 1052.44]  and the blind
[1052.44 --> 1053.46]  in our day,
[1053.66 --> 1054.56]  including us,
[1055.02 --> 1056.38]  desperately need
[1056.38 --> 1057.40]  the good news
[1057.40 --> 1058.26]  of Jesus Christ.
[1062.66 --> 1063.16]  Now,
[1063.20 --> 1063.48]  I don't know
[1063.48 --> 1064.28]  who you think of
[1064.28 --> 1064.86]  when you think
[1064.86 --> 1065.52]  poor,
[1065.82 --> 1066.12]  blind,
[1066.22 --> 1066.62]  oppressed.
[1067.28 --> 1068.62]  Somebody who needs,
[1068.86 --> 1069.86]  desperately needs
[1069.86 --> 1070.86]  the good news
[1070.86 --> 1071.62]  of Jesus Christ.
[1071.62 --> 1077.08]  So,
[1077.16 --> 1078.06]  our modern day poor,
[1078.70 --> 1079.92]  I suggest,
[1080.86 --> 1081.90]  both economically
[1081.90 --> 1082.68]  and spiritually,
[1083.36 --> 1084.34]  suffering through
[1084.34 --> 1085.26]  attempts at trying
[1085.26 --> 1086.06]  to satisfy
[1086.06 --> 1087.22]  deep longing
[1087.22 --> 1088.22]  and true happiness
[1088.22 --> 1089.36]  with anything
[1089.36 --> 1090.40]  and everything
[1090.40 --> 1091.58]  other than God.
[1093.66 --> 1094.82]  That's what it means
[1094.82 --> 1095.42]  to be poor,
[1095.50 --> 1095.70]  right?
[1097.38 --> 1098.76]  God is the answer,
[1098.90 --> 1100.06]  but we try to satisfy
[1100.06 --> 1100.72]  our needs
[1100.72 --> 1102.26]  with everything
[1102.26 --> 1103.16]  other than God.
[1104.54 --> 1105.22]  And also,
[1105.50 --> 1106.26]  in our culture
[1106.26 --> 1107.92]  of hyper-individualism,
[1108.62 --> 1109.86]  self-centeredness,
[1110.36 --> 1111.08]  the blind,
[1111.72 --> 1112.98]  our modern day blind,
[1113.24 --> 1114.96]  that fail to see God
[1114.96 --> 1115.98]  and the needs
[1115.98 --> 1116.58]  of others.
[1117.66 --> 1118.18]  And then,
[1118.30 --> 1119.22]  from this blindness,
[1120.10 --> 1121.06]  also the blindness
[1121.06 --> 1122.18]  that fail to see
[1122.18 --> 1123.42]  our own captivity
[1123.42 --> 1124.44]  and oppression,
[1125.22 --> 1126.08]  our own sins
[1126.08 --> 1126.84]  and brokenness,
[1127.18 --> 1128.44]  especially in a world
[1128.44 --> 1129.36]  of consumerism,
[1129.36 --> 1130.32]  busyness,
[1130.64 --> 1131.14]  screens,
[1131.56 --> 1132.12]  entertainment,
[1132.50 --> 1132.84]  pleasures,
[1133.22 --> 1134.16]  that try to grab
[1134.16 --> 1135.34]  every single second
[1135.34 --> 1136.74]  we have of our lives,
[1136.94 --> 1137.86]  trying to grab
[1137.86 --> 1138.96]  our whole beings
[1138.96 --> 1140.26]  away from God.
[1140.70 --> 1142.90]  That is our sinful selves.
[1144.50 --> 1146.24]  In the midst of this,
[1147.00 --> 1150.80]  we need Jesus Christ.
[1151.90 --> 1152.50]  So,
[1152.74 --> 1153.82]  how do we live
[1153.82 --> 1154.84]  as Christ followers
[1154.84 --> 1156.02]  and be that light
[1156.02 --> 1156.74]  for the world
[1156.74 --> 1157.56]  that is in darkness?
[1157.56 --> 1160.06]  As we conclude
[1160.06 --> 1161.04]  this morning,
[1161.26 --> 1161.96]  my suggestion
[1161.96 --> 1162.84]  is threefold.
[1163.62 --> 1164.14]  To start,
[1164.26 --> 1165.24]  I suggest that we must
[1165.24 --> 1166.88]  continue to remember.
[1168.02 --> 1169.60]  Remember and continue
[1169.60 --> 1170.58]  to be attentive
[1170.58 --> 1171.24]  and wrestle
[1171.24 --> 1172.62]  with our own brokenness,
[1172.96 --> 1173.56]  being aware
[1173.56 --> 1174.54]  of our own addictions
[1174.54 --> 1175.68]  and our own tendencies
[1175.68 --> 1177.54]  towards being consumerist,
[1177.62 --> 1178.26]  being too busy,
[1178.58 --> 1179.84]  trying to find self-worth
[1179.84 --> 1180.74]  in our own achievements,
[1180.98 --> 1182.30]  instead of looking to God
[1182.30 --> 1183.36]  for guidance and truth.
[1183.36 --> 1185.48]  We must be reminded
[1185.48 --> 1187.12]  that we look to Christ
[1187.12 --> 1188.20]  for our salvation,
[1188.80 --> 1190.48]  not our own achievements,
[1190.84 --> 1192.14]  not our own holiness.
[1192.82 --> 1193.10]  Why?
[1193.46 --> 1195.14]  Because while we were
[1195.14 --> 1195.78]  still sinners,
[1196.04 --> 1197.72]  while we are still sinners,
[1198.08 --> 1199.58]  Christ died for us.
[1199.84 --> 1201.56]  That is the gospel message.
[1203.50 --> 1203.96]  And second,
[1204.32 --> 1206.12]  we reflect the light
[1206.12 --> 1207.48]  of Christ together.
[1208.38 --> 1210.22]  You do not do this alone.
[1210.22 --> 1211.10]  Christianity,
[1211.68 --> 1212.94]  our identity as Christians
[1212.94 --> 1214.10]  and followers of Christ
[1214.10 --> 1215.52]  is always in the plural.
[1215.88 --> 1217.06]  It is the followers
[1217.06 --> 1218.20]  of Christ.
[1218.56 --> 1219.86]  And whenever Paul refers
[1219.86 --> 1220.54]  to you
[1220.54 --> 1222.00]  in his epistles,
[1222.12 --> 1222.96]  in his letters,
[1223.56 --> 1224.44]  it is y'all.
[1224.94 --> 1226.54]  It is not you singular.
[1227.50 --> 1228.58]  As much as you are
[1228.58 --> 1229.56]  important to God
[1229.56 --> 1231.10]  and that He saved you
[1231.10 --> 1232.54]  in your individual life,
[1233.28 --> 1234.60]  He has called us
[1234.60 --> 1236.06]  y'all together.
[1236.34 --> 1237.38]  We really need that
[1237.38 --> 1238.72]  in our Canadian English too.
[1239.18 --> 1239.84]  It's y'all.
[1240.42 --> 1241.22]  It's not just you.
[1241.68 --> 1242.66]  We do this together.
[1243.06 --> 1243.70]  Whether it be
[1243.70 --> 1244.94]  the ministries we serve
[1244.94 --> 1245.84]  in through our church,
[1246.18 --> 1246.80]  small groups,
[1246.96 --> 1247.36]  fellowship,
[1248.00 --> 1248.50]  taught rom,
[1248.62 --> 1249.22]  story time,
[1249.36 --> 1249.78]  pickleball,
[1249.90 --> 1250.26]  volleyball,
[1250.94 --> 1251.94]  can't leave out soccer,
[1252.34 --> 1252.48]  right?
[1252.52 --> 1253.50]  We still have that trophy.
[1254.34 --> 1254.70]  Prayer,
[1255.26 --> 1255.62]  worship,
[1255.88 --> 1256.60]  all the things
[1256.60 --> 1257.38]  that we saw today
[1257.38 --> 1258.42]  even in our slideshow.
[1258.80 --> 1259.62]  Or the ministries
[1259.62 --> 1260.68]  we partake in
[1260.68 --> 1262.02]  outside our church building,
[1262.38 --> 1263.60]  caring for those in need,
[1263.88 --> 1264.60]  being present
[1264.60 --> 1265.42]  for our family
[1265.42 --> 1266.08]  and friends,
[1266.20 --> 1267.92]  like really being present.
[1267.92 --> 1269.98]  not the looking
[1269.98 --> 1270.88]  at our phones
[1270.88 --> 1271.64]  and screens
[1271.64 --> 1271.94]  and going,
[1272.06 --> 1272.14]  yeah,
[1272.16 --> 1272.56]  I'm listening.
[1273.46 --> 1274.28]  But really,
[1274.40 --> 1275.44]  with our whole lives,
[1275.66 --> 1276.22]  our minds,
[1276.34 --> 1276.84]  our hearts,
[1277.48 --> 1278.42]  being attentive
[1278.42 --> 1280.76]  and being present
[1280.76 --> 1281.68]  for our family,
[1282.28 --> 1283.06]  for our friends
[1283.06 --> 1284.44]  and those in need.
[1285.16 --> 1286.06]  Just as much,
[1286.44 --> 1287.52]  just as much
[1287.52 --> 1288.72]  as we are devoted
[1288.72 --> 1289.30]  to Christ
[1289.30 --> 1290.28]  with our whole beings,
[1290.62 --> 1291.34]  we are devoted
[1291.34 --> 1292.04]  to one another
[1292.04 --> 1292.96]  with our whole beings.
[1293.76 --> 1293.96]  Yes,
[1294.00 --> 1294.78]  we come up short,
[1295.26 --> 1296.42]  but that is the calling
[1296.42 --> 1297.44]  that we are called to.
[1297.44 --> 1300.36]  And lastly,
[1300.88 --> 1303.42]  it's not by our own
[1303.42 --> 1303.84]  shiny,
[1304.02 --> 1304.26]  holy,
[1304.40 --> 1305.12]  perfect lives
[1305.12 --> 1305.92]  that we do this,
[1306.22 --> 1307.28]  that we reflect
[1307.28 --> 1308.04]  God's light.
[1308.70 --> 1310.58]  It is only by the power
[1310.58 --> 1311.34]  of the Spirit
[1311.34 --> 1312.78]  that we get to reflect
[1312.78 --> 1313.90]  the true light
[1313.90 --> 1315.62]  and proclaim the good news
[1315.62 --> 1316.10]  for a world
[1316.10 --> 1317.24]  that's in darkness.
[1318.42 --> 1319.62]  We witness to
[1319.62 --> 1320.94]  and reflect Jesus
[1320.94 --> 1322.08]  as the true light.
[1323.22 --> 1324.92]  It is not our own light.
[1324.92 --> 1327.86]  And thank God for that
[1327.86 --> 1328.52]  because my light
[1328.52 --> 1330.14]  would be terrible.
[1331.86 --> 1332.86]  We reflect
[1332.86 --> 1334.26]  the light of Christ
[1334.26 --> 1336.22]  and we get to reflect
[1336.22 --> 1337.08]  the true light
[1337.08 --> 1337.90]  to the world.
[1339.16 --> 1340.66]  May we proclaim together
[1340.66 --> 1342.36]  the year of the Lord's favor
[1342.36 --> 1343.74]  even in the year
[1343.74 --> 1344.82]  2024
[1344.82 --> 1345.94]  as we come up.
[1346.52 --> 1347.86]  And may we do that together
[1347.86 --> 1348.74]  as His body.
[1349.74 --> 1350.30]  Let's pray.
[1354.92 --> 1358.82]  loving,
[1359.38 --> 1360.20]  good,
[1360.36 --> 1361.02]  and merciful
[1361.02 --> 1361.96]  Father God,
[1362.86 --> 1364.28]  we come before you,
[1364.42 --> 1364.60]  Lord,
[1364.86 --> 1366.12]  and we give you thanks
[1366.12 --> 1367.12]  as we remember
[1367.12 --> 1371.10]  how you came to us
[1371.10 --> 1374.12]  and you dwelled among us
[1374.12 --> 1374.98]  as your people
[1374.98 --> 1376.58]  and you have saved us
[1376.58 --> 1377.74]  and freed us
[1377.74 --> 1379.16]  from our sins.
[1379.16 --> 1381.70]  Thank you,
[1381.80 --> 1381.98]  Lord,
[1382.10 --> 1384.52]  for restoring us
[1384.52 --> 1385.88]  and making us whole again
[1385.88 --> 1386.78]  as we dwell
[1386.78 --> 1389.18]  in your presence.
[1390.66 --> 1391.14]  Lord,
[1391.22 --> 1392.58]  we continue to come up short.
[1393.56 --> 1394.82]  We continue to wrestle
[1394.82 --> 1395.96]  with our old selves
[1395.96 --> 1397.32]  and our own brokenness
[1397.32 --> 1397.90]  and sins,
[1398.22 --> 1398.78]  but Lord,
[1398.88 --> 1400.28]  we know that we can trust
[1400.28 --> 1401.62]  and we can depend
[1401.62 --> 1402.56]  on your guidance
[1402.56 --> 1404.72]  as you live with us,
[1404.80 --> 1406.60]  as you journey with us
[1406.60 --> 1408.08]  in our everyday,
[1408.52 --> 1409.56]  day-to-day lives
[1409.56 --> 1411.14]  as we witness
[1411.14 --> 1411.88]  to your light.
[1412.96 --> 1413.82]  And so help us,
[1414.02 --> 1414.16]  Lord.
[1415.18 --> 1416.30]  Help us reflect
[1416.30 --> 1417.60]  your goodness,
[1418.68 --> 1419.46]  your love
[1419.46 --> 1420.28]  for the world.
[1421.94 --> 1422.76]  We thank you
[1422.76 --> 1423.48]  for our church,
[1423.86 --> 1424.42]  we thank you
[1424.42 --> 1425.36]  for the year that's been,
[1426.22 --> 1427.04]  and we thank you
[1427.04 --> 1428.00]  for the year to come
[1428.00 --> 1429.10]  as we continue
[1429.10 --> 1429.80]  to serve
[1429.80 --> 1431.54]  in your kingdom.
[1432.54 --> 1433.52]  In Jesus' name we pray.
[1434.70 --> 1435.00]  Amen.
[1436.60 --> 1437.60]  I invite you to stand
[1437.60 --> 1438.20]  as we sing
[1438.20 --> 1439.18]  our song of response.
[1439.18 --> 1439.54]  Amen.
