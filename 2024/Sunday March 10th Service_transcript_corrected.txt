[0.00 → 3.82] and do a little bit of thinking, a little bit of growing, hopefully together.
[6.04 → 13.94] We're in a series that is called The Good Fight.
[16.20 → 22.90] And we're looking in this series at our fight against the world, the devil, and the flesh.
[22.90 → 31.86] It's kind of part of our Lent preparations where we take a look at what's in us and what's around us
[31.86 → 40.52] that is causing us to not focus on Christ, maybe, or not be aware enough of how evil has worked in our lives.
[41.12 → 45.98] Because when Easter comes, we're celebrating the fact that we are saved from all that brokenness.
[47.34 → 50.06] Paul says, fight the good fight of the faith.
[50.06 → 56.38] He says, put on the full armour of God so you can stand up against the devil's schemes.
[57.10 → 58.42] Because he schemes.
[59.86 → 62.60] The devil is called the father of lies.
[63.04 → 65.76] So this really is a war on lies.
[67.24 → 72.30] We live in a world where sometimes it's hard to figure out what the truth is because there are so many lies around.
[73.88 → 79.14] And it's not so much that we tell lies, although we do, but that we live lies.
[80.06 → 83.26] And we see them as truth, but they are lies.
[83.46 → 87.44] And then they wreak havoc on our souls and havoc on our world.
[88.52 → 93.50] In this series, we're looking at these three areas where evil might mess with us.
[93.58 → 95.06] And I put it up on a slide here.
[96.04 → 97.40] This is kind of the idea here.
[97.40 → 100.28] We have this idea of deceptive ideas, lies.
[100.68 → 102.38] Deceptive ideas that come from the devil.
[103.28 → 105.44] That play to disordered desires.
[105.92 → 107.56] That's the flesh at work.
[108.00 → 110.98] And that are normalized in the society we live in.
[111.36 → 112.58] And that is the world.
[113.62 → 116.48] The last two weeks, we've looked closely at the work of the devil.
[117.04 → 120.98] And today, we're going to do some looking and thinking on the topic of the flesh.
[120.98 → 124.78] Pastor Dave will continue that next week.
[125.36 → 131.72] So I'm going to jump into Galatians 5 at this point here and do some thinking with you on this.
[132.34 → 134.08] Galatians 5, verse 13.
[135.38 → 139.14] You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free.
[140.10 → 143.18] But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh.
[143.62 → 146.72] Rather, serve one another humbly in love.
[146.72 → 151.86] Paul is saying, yeah, there's the devil, the father of lies.
[151.98 → 154.80] A powerful evil encouraging lies that ruin us.
[155.08 → 156.72] That lead to these disordered desires.
[157.58 → 160.14] That even mess around with our idea of what freedom really means.
[160.86 → 166.48] And he, the devil, fans the flames of pride, lust, greed, hate, fear.
[166.58 → 167.52] And we can go on and on.
[168.14 → 172.54] The devil gains a foothold in our lives through our sins.
[172.54 → 178.62] And the way to deal with the devil is to deal with your sins.
[179.68 → 183.42] And also, there's more to our sins and struggles than meets the eye.
[184.12 → 185.48] And we need to understand that.
[186.36 → 190.78] There's an old book called The Christian in Complete Armour.
[191.34 → 192.50] And he writes this.
[193.52 → 195.00] If men hear a noise at night.
[195.06 → 198.38] This is a while back when people tended to believe in the devil.
[198.38 → 201.28] I think nowadays, Dave and Jonathan talked about that.
[201.44 → 202.80] Sometimes we even struggle with that.
[202.88 → 204.00] But the devil is real.
[204.54 → 208.74] So if we hear a noise at night, when it's dark and all that, they cry, the devil, the devil.
[208.82 → 209.88] And they run for their lives.
[210.76 → 215.14] But they carry the devil around in their hearts all day.
[217.36 → 217.74] How?
[218.92 → 220.04] In our anxieties.
[220.86 → 221.52] In our lusts.
[222.36 → 223.16] In our addictions.
[223.34 → 224.44] In our self-righteousness.
[224.52 → 225.00] In our greed.
[225.10 → 225.58] In our pride.
[225.58 → 225.62] In our pride.
[226.56 → 228.08] And a question then could be asked.
[228.16 → 228.76] People of God.
[228.88 → 230.70] Why don't we run from our pride?
[230.80 → 232.04] Crying the devil, the devil.
[232.16 → 234.02] Why don't we run from our lusts?
[234.02 → 234.82] Our self-righteous.
[234.94 → 236.38] Crying out the devil, the devil.
[237.60 → 238.66] From our resentments.
[238.76 → 239.44] From our grudges.
[241.04 → 244.10] Because you see, when we hold on to a grudge.
[244.80 → 247.10] We're opening ourselves up to evil.
[247.58 → 250.30] And to the evil's power in our lives.
[250.30 → 253.38] When we nurse those sins.
[253.52 → 257.90] We open ourselves up to the wrong that wants to consume us.
[258.94 → 261.32] In Ephesians 6, Paul says it this way.
[261.40 → 262.58] And we looked at it last week.
[262.76 → 264.74] He said, put on the full armour of God.
[264.90 → 268.64] So you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
[268.64 → 272.56] For our struggle is not against flesh and blood.
[272.78 → 273.74] But against the rulers.
[273.90 → 274.60] Against the authorities.
[274.78 → 276.50] Against the power of this dark world.
[276.84 → 279.34] And against spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realm.
[279.60 → 281.30] All that is going on.
[281.90 → 283.72] All that we need to be aware of.
[284.44 → 286.18] And then we fight that.
[286.72 → 289.38] Through a fight against our own sinfulness and brokenness.
[289.38 → 294.08] So we deal with our pride and our anxiety and our fears.
[294.58 → 295.54] And we fight the devil.
[296.10 → 298.68] By fighting the lies that we hold on to.
[300.00 → 302.84] We shine the light of Christ into our lives.
[303.00 → 304.70] So we see what's true.
[305.06 → 308.72] And we see what lies exist in us.
[310.90 → 316.66] I'm going to take a look at a few areas that will reveal hopefully some lies.
[316.66 → 318.66] That we all tend to hold on to.
[318.78 → 319.68] Particularly in our culture.
[320.98 → 322.98] There's a saying that became popular.
[323.48 → 324.38] And it goes like this.
[325.08 → 327.50] The heart wants what the heart wants.
[328.54 → 329.60] You've heard that before?
[331.20 → 332.86] The heart wants what the heart wants.
[333.40 → 336.48] And you know, maybe it even sounds almost a little romantic.
[336.60 → 337.60] I can't help myself.
[337.72 → 338.60] I'm falling in love.
[338.84 → 340.64] The heart wants what the heart wants.
[341.62 → 344.34] But when you look at the backstory of where this comes from.
[344.34 → 346.06] It was spoken.
[346.18 → 349.46] A line was spoken in an interview with Woody Allen.
[351.04 → 352.62] Anyone here know who Woody Allen is?
[353.64 → 354.64] There's a few of you.
[355.10 → 355.96] All the young people know.
[356.04 → 356.64] Not a clue.
[357.26 → 357.36] Right?
[357.96 → 358.16] Yeah.
[358.26 → 359.30] And I get that.
[360.08 → 361.44] Woody Allen was a very famous actor.
[362.58 → 366.88] He was having an affair with his adopted stepdaughter.
[367.80 → 368.76] He was 56.
[369.00 → 369.94] She was 21.
[369.94 → 373.88] All the while still being in a relationship with her mother.
[374.10 → 376.08] Another famous actress named Mia Farrell.
[378.92 → 381.18] He was asked, why are you doing this?
[381.22 → 383.42] And he said, the heart wants what the heart wants.
[384.22 → 384.96] So it's all good, right?
[386.24 → 387.84] At least that was the intent.
[387.84 → 392.40] The flesh wants what the flesh wants, I guess.
[393.04 → 394.82] But I prefer Paul's honesty.
[394.92 → 398.84] When Paul looks at the lies that he holds onto and believes in.
[399.06 → 401.82] Paul says it a little differently than Woody Allen did.
[402.08 → 404.08] Romans 7, Paul says it this way.
[404.58 → 407.34] I know that good itself does not dwell in me.
[407.40 → 408.76] Isn't that a fascinating way to start?
[408.94 → 409.96] An honest way to start.
[410.18 → 412.96] I know good doesn't dwell in me.
[412.96 → 419.44] I know I have a tendency toward wrong, toward evil, toward sin.
[420.04 → 420.14] Right?
[420.26 → 421.78] So good did not dwell in me.
[422.04 → 423.52] That in my sinful nature.
[423.82 → 427.86] I have the desire to do what is good, but I can't carry it out.
[428.70 → 429.48] Can you relate?
[431.30 → 435.82] For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I don't want to do.
[436.04 → 437.78] This I keep on doing.
[439.64 → 441.42] This verse stings, doesn't it?
[441.42 → 448.38] Now, if I do what I don't want to do, it is no longer I that do it, but the sin living in me that does it.
[448.62 → 450.70] What a wretched man I am.
[452.34 → 455.92] Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?
[456.50 → 460.30] And then he answers, thanks be to God who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[460.78 → 463.50] He doesn't simply dismiss what his struggle is.
[463.58 → 465.12] Oh, the heart wants what the heart wants.
[466.62 → 467.78] Give me a pass now.
[467.78 → 474.30] No, he says this, there's sin in me, there's evil in me, it's at work in me, I don't know what to do, I need a saviour.
[474.48 → 475.96] Oh, there we go, now we're in the right spot.
[475.96 → 485.76] Yeah, I do things that my heart wants to, but I shouldn't because they're sin, and they destroy me, and they destroy those around me.
[486.12 → 487.46] They're lies.
[487.46 → 494.62] I'm struggling because I know it's a lie I'm living, even though I keep doing it.
[494.62 → 496.14] That's what Paul's saying, that's what we need to say.
[496.48 → 500.32] Alan refused to admit he was living wrongly.
[500.32 → 507.34] The excuse, well the heart wants what the heart wants, the flesh wants what the flesh wants.
[509.02 → 511.78] There's a belief system of too many in our world today.
[513.36 → 516.88] Pastor and scholar Eugene Peterson, he wrote the version of the Bible called The Message.
[516.88 → 525.32] He defined the flesh as the corruption that sin has introduced into our very appetites and instincts.
[527.24 → 530.90] Sin shows up in our appetites and instincts.
[532.38 → 533.74] You want to step out of the Christian world?
[533.84 → 538.32] Leading brain expert Jeffrey Schwartz wrote, or calls that our animal brain.
[540.10 → 543.18] We have an animal brain which just goes on impulse.
[543.18 → 549.46] Wise people, wise people all around, recognize that pleasure is not the same as happiness.
[550.02 → 551.74] Pleasure is about dopamine.
[552.30 → 553.58] Happiness is about serotonin.
[553.82 → 557.18] Pleasure is about the next hit to feeling good.
[557.26 → 560.52] Happiness is about contentment over the long haul.
[560.92 → 562.20] Pleasure is about want.
[562.54 → 564.70] Happiness is about freedom from want.
[566.16 → 571.22] But when you swallow the lies of Satan, you'll live out those lies.
[571.22 → 573.46] What are some of those lies?
[574.34 → 576.78] Well, one similar to what I already talked about.
[577.02 → 577.74] Follow your heart.
[578.12 → 578.24] Right?
[578.62 → 581.26] Your heart won't mislead you, will it?
[582.36 → 583.46] Follow your heart.
[584.20 → 584.48] Right?
[584.90 → 585.76] How about this one?
[586.08 → 587.14] You do you.
[588.90 → 589.38] Really?
[590.12 → 591.74] What if me isn't very good?
[592.78 → 594.06] I probably shouldn't be doing me.
[596.34 → 596.82] Right?
[597.04 → 597.88] Or how about this one?
[598.08 → 599.60] Speak your truth.
[599.60 → 602.24] Well, what if it's against my truth?
[602.34 → 604.96] Well, then you're speaking your truth because we have no truth.
[606.02 → 607.14] And that's kind of how that one goes.
[607.36 → 608.88] And of course, then, there's a famous one.
[609.58 → 611.20] Be true to yourself.
[612.32 → 613.26] Be true to yourself.
[613.40 → 614.38] It's often quoted.
[614.72 → 620.44] It's actually, ironically, from a Shakespeare play from Hamlet where it says,
[620.94 → 623.02] This above all, to thine own self be true.
[624.36 → 626.02] And any big Shakespeare buffs here?
[626.02 → 628.08] Anyone remember who said that?
[629.14 → 630.74] I'd be stunned if somebody knew.
[631.28 → 632.60] Oh, somebody does know.
[632.68 → 633.22] Who says it?
[634.40 → 634.78] Yeah.
[635.02 → 635.46] Wow.
[635.88 → 637.08] I'm super impressed.
[637.08 → 642.36] And what does Shakespeare say Polonius is?
[643.16 → 643.96] Do you know that one, too?
[646.14 → 646.40] Hey?
[647.38 → 647.76] Yeah.
[647.98 → 649.66] And Shakespeare refers to him as the fool.
[651.54 → 652.46] He's the fool.
[652.56 → 657.80] The fool says, to thine own heart be true, as if you can trust your heart all the time.
[658.78 → 660.60] It doesn't go that way.
[660.60 → 664.42] Let me give you a couple of quotes that hit home for me.
[664.50 → 665.38] Maybe they will for you, too.
[665.88 → 667.38] Jonathan Grant wrote this.
[669.80 → 671.00] Modern authenticity.
[671.46 → 671.82] All right?
[671.96 → 673.96] So modern, to be authentic, right?
[674.04 → 674.66] That's what we want.
[674.90 → 680.00] Modern authenticity encourages us to create our own beliefs and morality.
[680.62 → 686.12] The only rule being that they must resonate with who we feel we really are.
[686.12 → 692.16] The worst thing we can do is to conform to some moral code that is imposed on us from the outside.
[692.36 → 693.24] By society.
[693.42 → 694.08] By our parents.
[694.34 → 694.82] The church.
[694.92 → 695.54] Or whoever else.
[695.92 → 702.28] It is deemed to be self-evident that any such imposition would undermine our unique identity.
[703.08 → 709.00] The authentic self believes that personal meaning must be found within ourselves.
[709.30 → 711.70] Or must resonate with our one-of-a-kind personality.
[711.70 → 717.32] That sound like the world we live in?
[719.62 → 722.02] And then happiness becomes this.
[722.12 → 726.10] Happiness becomes about feeling good, not necessarily being good.
[728.70 → 730.92] Trust your flesh.
[733.36 → 736.96] Trust your thoughts more than anything else.
[737.38 → 739.32] Because that won't lead you astray.
[739.32 → 741.94] You'll be authentic then.
[743.74 → 749.18] David Wells, a theologian, describes what happens when society is given over to the flesh.
[749.68 → 750.78] Look at this quote with me.
[751.60 → 753.64] He writes, theology becomes therapy.
[753.98 → 755.64] Again, it's not a knock on therapy.
[756.18 → 757.68] Theology is built on truth.
[758.44 → 759.92] Therapy hopefully leads you to truth.
[760.64 → 763.54] But here we're saying theology becomes therapy.
[763.54 → 767.94] The biblical interest in righteousness is replaced by the search for happiness.
[768.32 → 769.54] Holiness by wholeness.
[770.46 → 771.80] Truth by feeling.
[772.20 → 774.18] Ethics by feeling good about oneself.
[774.54 → 777.72] The world shrinks to a range of personal circumstances.
[778.14 → 781.26] The community of faith shrinks to a circle of personal friends.
[781.60 → 782.62] The past recedes.
[782.76 → 783.62] The church recedes.
[783.76 → 784.58] The world recedes.
[784.98 → 788.74] All that remains is the self.
[788.74 → 793.56] All right.
[795.20 → 796.46] That doesn't sound healthy.
[798.24 → 803.30] These are some of the profound lies that we live with in our world today.
[804.08 → 808.50] And as Christians, we have to be careful that we don't get swept up into them somehow.
[808.50 → 812.50] Now, here's one of the big problems with these lies.
[812.90 → 816.88] The problem is this puts crushing weight on the self.
[817.08 → 818.98] One that it was never designed to bear.
[819.20 → 821.40] When we say things like stay true to yourself.
[821.78 → 822.80] Justify yourself.
[823.16 → 824.74] Make yourself happy.
[825.20 → 826.98] The pressure is exhausting.
[827.84 → 829.18] Because it doesn't work.
[829.28 → 830.18] You can't do it.
[830.44 → 834.54] And it's no wonder we feel so anxious and so burnt out so often.
[834.54 → 842.52] If I'm in charge of my happiness, that's exhausting.
[844.34 → 850.98] If I'm to surrender to the one who actually makes me deeply happy, that's a whole other matter.
[853.46 → 855.88] Neil Planting, the theologian, said,
[855.88 → 869.68] In such a culture, the self exists to be explored, indulged, and expressed, but not disciplined or restrained.
[873.68 → 874.96] I have these feelings.
[875.08 → 876.12] I must explore them.
[876.42 → 877.44] I don't have to restrain them.
[878.58 → 880.40] This is the world we live in.
[880.40 → 887.40] What did Jesus say is actually the real way toward peace and happiness and all that God promises us?
[888.12 → 890.02] In Matthew 16, Jesus says it this way.
[890.92 → 892.52] Then Jesus said to his disciples,
[893.08 → 895.82] Whoever wants to be my disciple must what?
[895.94 → 897.46] Must indulge themselves.
[899.24 → 899.54] Right?
[899.64 → 900.56] It doesn't say that, does it?
[901.00 → 902.38] Must indulge themselves.
[903.20 → 903.66] No, no.
[903.72 → 905.02] Must deny themselves.
[905.56 → 907.40] Must take up their cross and follow me.
[907.40 → 912.22] Whoever wants to save their lives, make it on their own terms, will lose it.
[912.40 → 915.40] Whoever loses their lives for me will find it.
[915.58 → 922.54] That is the pathway to happiness, to blessing, to wholeness, to holiness even better.
[926.00 → 934.50] And the irony that's so easy to miss in our modern world is that our strongest desires are not actually our deepest desires.
[934.50 → 941.04] You might feel a tremendously strong desire to do whatever it might be.
[941.28 → 944.32] But it's not necessarily your deepest desire.
[944.84 → 949.52] So at that moment of temptation, with the strong desire pulling at the flesh,
[950.02 → 954.88] with that desire to maybe make condescending remarks about someone else so you can feel better about yourself,
[955.14 → 957.20] with that desire to buy something you don't need,
[957.56 → 960.44] or to overeat, or overdrink, or lust, or ignore God,
[960.56 → 962.92] or watch that show you shouldn't be watching.
[962.92 → 965.54] Although those desires feel overwhelming,
[965.92 → 971.36] they are not the deepest desires in you.
[973.02 → 976.86] That's the truth against those lies.
[980.48 → 982.02] Let me ask you this.
[983.16 → 988.10] Some of you might struggle with certain desires.
[989.32 → 990.86] There are all kinds of them.
[990.86 → 995.18] I have mine.
[996.86 → 999.04] When you give in to those desires,
[999.68 → 1003.86] do you ever feel better afterwards?
[1003.86 → 1019.14] One of the things in the cycle of addiction that takes place is when you give in to these impulses that aren't great for you,
[1019.86 → 1022.22] you end up in a place called self-loathing.
[1022.22 → 1028.10] You end up hating yourself and think of yourself, what a loser I am.
[1028.48 → 1031.88] And it kind of feeds the addiction cycle even a little bit more again.
[1032.36 → 1034.74] It pushes you to want to feel good again.
[1034.94 → 1036.68] And then you're back to those desires.
[1037.36 → 1041.44] But we never, because those are lies, they never satisfy.
[1041.44 → 1047.50] You never meet someone who's addicted to something and finally say,
[1047.56 → 1050.38] oh, finally I got there through the addiction.
[1052.84 → 1056.68] Oh, took me about 20 years, but finally the alcohol worked.
[1056.68 → 1060.22] We don't go there.
[1064.22 → 1066.76] So here's the question we should be asking.
[1067.32 → 1068.70] What do you really want?
[1070.34 → 1071.34] What do you really want?
[1071.34 → 1075.40] And I think if you go deep enough,
[1075.88 → 1080.18] you're going to find out what you really, really, really, really want is God.
[1081.46 → 1083.58] And you want to live in His love,
[1084.20 → 1087.68] that forever love that only exists in God.
[1091.16 → 1095.02] And whatever set of desires that you give in to,
[1095.46 → 1097.42] the desire to follow Christ,
[1097.50 → 1099.76] or the desire to give in to whatever it is that is,
[1099.76 → 1102.74] you will shape the trajectory of your souls
[1102.74 → 1105.52] and the society at large.
[1107.56 → 1110.38] Let's look at Galatians 5.
[1110.48 → 1113.18] Paul gives a list here, 19 through 21.
[1113.46 → 1117.68] He gives a list of choosing to follow your not the deepest desires.
[1118.00 → 1118.78] Here's what happens.
[1119.42 → 1121.26] The acts of the flesh are obvious.
[1121.50 → 1121.94] What are they?
[1122.58 → 1125.10] Sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery,
[1125.44 → 1126.62] idolatry and witchcraft,
[1126.86 → 1129.26] hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,
[1129.26 → 1131.96] selfish ambition, dissension, factions,
[1132.38 → 1134.24] envy, drunkenness, orgies and the like.
[1134.50 → 1135.76] I warn you as I did before,
[1136.02 → 1138.28] that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God
[1138.28 → 1140.94] because the kingdom of God isn't in those places.
[1144.24 → 1145.48] Any of those sound familiar?
[1146.48 → 1147.48] Sexual immorality,
[1147.60 → 1149.38] when we think of the porn culture we live in
[1149.38 → 1150.80] and the hookup culture we live in,
[1151.22 → 1153.44] hate, discord, cancel culture,
[1153.62 → 1156.20] tribalism, selfish ambition and factions.
[1156.20 → 1158.70] We think of the politics and how you can't talk about it
[1158.70 → 1159.70] and the latest issues.
[1159.82 → 1160.98] We all hate each other over them.
[1161.42 → 1161.82] Envy.
[1162.08 → 1163.74] We look at the internet and advertising
[1163.74 → 1165.28] and we see how we don't measure up.
[1165.68 → 1166.62] Drunkenness and orgies.
[1166.92 → 1169.40] So much of the media making what is awful
[1169.40 → 1172.00] into something that is kind of normal.
[1172.00 → 1181.70] All of that verses what Paul describes
[1181.70 → 1184.80] as life in step with the Spirit.
[1185.82 → 1188.64] Let's look at another list out of Galatians 5.
[1189.10 → 1192.64] Look at Galatians 5, 16 and then 22 to 25.
[1193.04 → 1193.76] So Paul says,
[1193.84 → 1195.54] rather than that horrible list that I just read,
[1195.92 → 1197.26] I say walk by the Spirit
[1197.26 → 1200.18] and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh,
[1200.18 → 1202.42] but the fruit of the Spirit is,
[1203.08 → 1204.02] and here's the new list.
[1204.32 → 1205.26] Tell me which one you like better.
[1206.62 → 1210.90] Love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness,
[1211.54 → 1214.38] goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.
[1214.70 → 1215.90] Against such there's no law
[1215.90 → 1217.16] because there's nothing wrong with them.
[1218.12 → 1222.24] Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh
[1222.24 → 1224.54] with its passions and desires.
[1224.88 → 1226.34] Since we live by the Spirit,
[1226.80 → 1230.00] let's keep in step with the Spirit.
[1230.18 → 1236.98] Where the truth of Christ will set you free.
[1238.52 → 1240.64] Where the truth of Christ will set you free.
[1241.16 → 1242.86] Let me say something about freedom.
[1244.02 → 1245.84] And let me quote the great philosopher
[1245.84 → 1247.28] Princess Elsa from Frozen.
[1251.74 → 1253.02] Where she says,
[1253.02 → 1255.92] No right, no wrong,
[1256.44 → 1257.94] no rules for me,
[1258.40 → 1259.28] I'm free.
[1262.28 → 1263.76] Lovely thing for a pillow.
[1264.56 → 1265.12] Made it on there.
[1266.64 → 1267.52] Wonderful lesson.
[1268.28 → 1269.00] That is, by the way,
[1269.02 → 1270.16] not Paul's view of freedom,
[1270.24 → 1270.94] nor is it Jesus.
[1271.38 → 1274.48] Freedom isn't simply about freedom from restraint.
[1276.48 → 1279.76] Removing all restraints that block what my heart wants.
[1279.76 → 1281.08] No, no, it's not that.
[1281.32 → 1285.94] Freedom is the ability to choose what is good.
[1289.14 → 1291.40] To be liberated from sin
[1291.40 → 1293.16] and to build loving relationships
[1293.16 → 1296.10] around God's love and His design for life.
[1296.36 → 1298.02] Because positive and real freedom
[1298.02 → 1301.10] means we need a power bigger than ourselves.
[1301.10 → 1303.56] The AA movement gets that.
[1303.76 → 1304.94] They call it a higher power,
[1305.34 → 1307.46] just to be open with people a little bit.
[1307.64 → 1308.54] But it's really God.
[1308.86 → 1311.02] You need a higher power than yourself
[1311.02 → 1313.30] to overcome all those desires
[1313.30 → 1315.26] that aren't healthy for you.
[1318.00 → 1320.90] Strong desires for self-gratification
[1320.90 → 1323.30] will be replaced by our deepest desire
[1323.30 → 1325.46] for self-giving love
[1325.46 → 1326.90] that we give to others
[1326.90 → 1328.64] and we bring them into that love
[1328.64 → 1331.38] and our relationships flourish in that.
[1334.66 → 1335.82] All that to say,
[1336.82 → 1339.16] much of what our world calls freedom
[1339.16 → 1342.06] is what the way of Jesus calls slavery.
[1345.44 → 1348.18] To gain true intimacy
[1348.18 → 1351.18] means giving up autonomy.
[1353.74 → 1355.32] C.S. Lewis describes it this way.
[1355.32 → 1357.36] He says, the main work of life
[1357.36 → 1360.08] is to come out of ourselves,
[1360.48 → 1362.64] out of our little dark prisons
[1362.64 → 1364.28] that we were born into.
[1365.84 → 1367.70] And he said, the danger is,
[1368.52 → 1370.86] the danger that exists if we don't do that
[1370.86 → 1373.28] is coming to love the prison.
[1376.68 → 1378.28] And I see the world there.
[1379.06 → 1382.32] We start loving the prisons
[1382.32 → 1383.42] and defining them as,
[1383.74 → 1385.04] hey, that's your space.
[1385.32 → 1386.28] No, it's a prison.
[1388.14 → 1388.96] It's a prison.
[1389.44 → 1390.28] And because that happens,
[1390.46 → 1392.20] we normalize enslavement,
[1392.76 → 1394.62] which is a terribly sad thing to do.
[1395.10 → 1396.96] This is the human journey.
[1398.58 → 1399.50] And instead,
[1399.94 → 1401.34] instead, Scripture says,
[1401.62 → 1402.60] hey, what we really want
[1402.60 → 1403.28] instead of slavery,
[1403.46 → 1405.06] we want to have an exodus
[1405.06 → 1406.30] to the promised land.
[1406.66 → 1408.28] Christ still offers that.
[1408.48 → 1410.06] It is offering that right now
[1410.06 → 1411.22] with his life.
[1411.22 → 1413.36] He says, I will free you
[1413.36 → 1415.68] from that prison of sin and self
[1415.68 → 1417.42] and lead you to a new land,
[1417.66 → 1419.64] to a new way of living
[1419.64 → 1422.60] that frees you.
[1422.60 → 1426.74] That's why he says,
[1427.56 → 1428.66] I am the way.
[1430.24 → 1431.56] I am the truth.
[1433.18 → 1434.38] I am the life.
[1435.14 → 1436.82] No one comes to the Father.
[1436.96 → 1437.90] There is no other way
[1437.90 → 1440.46] except through me.
[1440.46 → 1447.78] And then we come to him
[1447.78 → 1449.12] to do what?
[1449.42 → 1451.36] To follow those ways,
[1451.62 → 1453.40] to embrace his truth
[1453.40 → 1455.38] so we can live his life
[1455.38 → 1458.48] by the power of his spirit in us.
[1458.48 → 1460.16] That's the goal.
[1463.08 → 1463.76] That's the goal.
[1465.80 → 1467.46] And then we do all we can
[1467.46 → 1468.96] to build our entire life,
[1469.12 → 1471.48] every, every minuscule part of it
[1471.48 → 1472.68] around Christ.
[1475.02 → 1476.14] And that's another sermon.
[1479.26 → 1480.60] We're going to have communion together.
[1483.68 → 1484.46] As you can see,
[1484.54 → 1485.56] we don't have stations.
[1486.36 → 1488.28] We're going to have communion served.
[1489.36 → 1491.22] But we are coming to the table.
[1492.34 → 1493.78] And we're coming to the table
[1493.78 → 1496.58] acknowledging that only Christ
[1496.58 → 1497.72] can nourish us.
[1498.70 → 1499.52] Only Christ.
[1499.74 → 1502.08] Nothing else can nourish us.
[1502.18 → 1504.02] In fact, anything but Christ
[1504.02 → 1505.00] kills us.
[1506.30 → 1508.32] Kills us because it's not the truth.
[1509.34 → 1511.58] And we are here to invite Jesus
[1511.58 → 1515.04] into our lives ever, ever more.
[1515.44 → 1516.44] Remembering that Jesus
[1516.44 → 1519.32] is our Lord and our Saviour
[1519.32 → 1521.10] and he brings life to us.
[1521.46 → 1523.06] So our focus is to be on him
[1523.06 → 1524.54] and not the lies.
[1526.66 → 1528.74] I invite you to partake of communion
[1528.74 → 1530.02] if you want to follow Jesus.
[1531.68 → 1533.46] As I said, you'll remain seated.
[1533.46 → 1536.08] The elders and the deacons
[1536.08 → 1537.26] will pass out the bread
[1537.26 → 1539.60] and then we'll eat together.
[1539.60 → 1540.68] So hang on to it.
[1540.90 → 1541.68] We'll eat together
[1541.68 → 1543.40] and then we'll pass out the juice
[1543.40 → 1545.60] and we'll drink together.
[1545.80 → 1547.44] So hang on to that as well.
[1547.44 → 1550.54] We're going to have a piece of art up here.
[1552.40 → 1553.32] And that piece of art,
[1553.42 → 1554.68] as we have it each week,
[1554.72 → 1556.24] is for you to reflect on.
[1556.94 → 1557.78] And that piece of art
[1557.78 → 1559.18] that I picked for this week
[1559.18 → 1561.32] is Rembrandt's picture
[1561.32 → 1563.88] of the prodigal.
[1563.88 → 1566.88] And it's...
[1572.46 → 1573.88] When you...
[1574.36 → 1575.36] The prodigal's a picture
[1575.36 → 1577.64] of choosing life in the flesh.
[1578.88 → 1580.36] The prodigal comes to the father
[1580.36 → 1580.70] and says,
[1580.78 → 1582.02] hey, give me my inheritance now.
[1582.28 → 1583.04] I want to live it up.
[1583.12 → 1584.74] I want to define life as I see fit.
[1585.28 → 1586.44] And the father says,
[1586.48 → 1586.82] here you go.
[1586.90 → 1587.96] Here's your inheritance.
[1588.34 → 1589.36] And he goes out there
[1589.36 → 1591.02] and he lives a wild and crazy life
[1591.02 → 1592.74] and it ends up in a pig pen
[1592.74 → 1593.72] with nothing left.
[1594.22 → 1596.18] And he comes home empty.
[1596.98 → 1599.20] He comes home with nothing but regrets.
[1601.72 → 1602.80] That's life in the flesh.
[1605.28 → 1606.64] But the father is there waiting.
[1608.44 → 1609.76] What I want you to picture...
[1609.76 → 1610.54] I want you to picture
[1610.54 → 1611.64] what...
[1611.64 → 1613.84] What lies...
[1613.84 → 1615.58] He had to acknowledge all those lies.
[1615.90 → 1617.64] What lies are you holding on to?
[1617.86 → 1619.32] And I want you to picture yourself
[1619.32 → 1619.92] coming home
[1619.92 → 1622.12] knowing the emptiness of those lies
[1622.12 → 1623.48] and then coming to the father
[1623.48 → 1625.98] and finding the father's embrace for you
[1625.98 → 1627.48] in spite of the lies
[1627.48 → 1628.88] you followed for so long.
[1630.50 → 1631.88] I want you to think about that.
[1632.96 → 1634.24] There's going to be some music playing
[1634.24 → 1636.16] and as I said to you,
[1636.84 → 1638.42] we'll then have the bread together
[1638.42 → 1639.36] and then we'll have the juice together
[1639.36 → 1643.10] and we'll then refocus heavily on Jesus.
[1644.68 → 1646.02] I invite the elders and deacons
[1646.02 → 1646.56] to come forward.
[1646.56 → 1646.62] Amen.
