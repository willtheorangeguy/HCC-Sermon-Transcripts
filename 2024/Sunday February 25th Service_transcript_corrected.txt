[0.00 → 14.42] Good morning, Hope.
[16.56 → 17.12] Wow.
[18.22 → 19.50] That was very encouraging.
[19.64 → 20.42] Good morning, Hope.
[20.54 → 20.86] Yes.
[22.28 → 23.60] It's good to see you too.
[23.70 → 24.28] Yes, I know.
[25.28 → 27.32] Were you expecting somebody else to come up?
[27.44 → 27.56] No.
[27.56 → 30.10] I guess it's been a while.
[30.32 → 31.04] Well, good morning.
[31.48 → 38.12] It's my privilege to continue our sermon series called The Good Fight, where we reflect on
[38.12 → 40.82] the very real fight that we are journeying through as Christians.
[41.54 → 46.30] Now, we journey through this fight, the spiritual warfare, we sometimes call it, against our
[46.30 → 52.08] flesh or sinful nature, against the world or the culture that seeks to live without
[52.08 → 52.56] God.
[52.56 → 59.82] And today, I get to talk about the devil, a being that seeks to split us away from God.
[60.94 → 66.86] And so, we have many names for this being, whether it be Satan, which is interestingly
[66.86 → 70.82] from Hebrew roots, Satan, which means adversary or enemy.
[71.02 → 72.12] That's what we call it, the enemy.
[72.12 → 79.36] Or, in our passage today, it's called the tempter, because the devil tries to trip up Jesus and God's
[79.36 → 79.70] people.
[80.40 → 84.80] Another name that we use is the devil, which comes from the Greek diabolos.
[85.24 → 88.46] And it has the meaning of splitting, as one commentator says.
[88.96 → 91.30] So, in another way, you could say he's the splitter.
[92.06 → 92.50] Of what?
[92.50 → 100.14] Splitter of relationships between us and God, between ourselves, between each other, and
[100.14 → 101.24] between all creation.
[101.38 → 105.30] That's the fall, the rebellion against God and the fall of creation.
[106.00 → 112.26] And lastly, Jesus also calls it the father of lies in the Gospel of John, because the
[112.26 → 115.60] native tongue for the devil is lies and deception.
[116.42 → 117.56] Lies and deception.
[117.56 → 121.74] These names or titles reflect how the devil works.
[122.32 → 123.72] In other words, it's his MO.
[124.16 → 130.32] His character, his being itself, stands against everything that God beautifully designed as
[130.32 → 131.80] a reflection of his goodness.
[132.48 → 133.94] And he stands against that.
[134.34 → 137.56] Through lies and deception, he tries to break all of this down.
[139.26 → 144.60] And it's like, so thinking about lies and deception, the thing that popped into my head
[144.60 → 146.96] as I was preparing was commercials.
[147.56 → 151.84] And how they promise you happiness on a snippet of truth.
[152.16 → 153.88] It's not all false, not all of it.
[154.22 → 159.32] But based on a little tiny snippet of truth, they try to deceive you into tricking you to
[159.32 → 161.00] think their product is the best.
[161.72 → 167.04] And so, I actually Googled for this sermon the most deceptive commercial.
[168.00 → 170.36] And you know what one of the top results were?
[171.92 → 174.06] I won't name it, but it was a dating site.
[174.06 → 176.18] I won't name the specific dating site.
[176.18 → 182.04] But it's a dating site that promised you your perfect match based on scientific research.
[182.74 → 185.30] Now, this is actually based on real research.
[185.62 → 188.22] So, there is some truth to that.
[188.22 → 197.72] But it's deceptive when they had to create fake profiles to make your perfect match, bait you into paying for their services,
[198.04 → 200.12] and you end up being sad and broken again.
[201.52 → 206.82] And so, the best lies are the ones that are a twisting of the truth.
[206.82 → 209.06] And this is how the devil works.
[209.76 → 213.20] Not a blatant lie, but a twisting of the truth.
[214.32 → 219.96] And so, on that cheerful note, if you would turn with me to Matthew chapter 4, and we read from verse 1,
[220.92 → 224.28] on how our Saviour Jesus was also tested in the wilderness.
[225.78 → 229.10] Matthew chapter 4, verse 1.
[229.10 → 235.24] Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
[236.20 → 239.80] After fasting 40 days and 40 nights, he was hungry.
[240.84 → 242.40] The tempter came to him and said,
[242.70 → 246.16] If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.
[246.90 → 247.72] Jesus answered,
[248.04 → 248.58] It is written,
[249.04 → 253.18] Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.
[253.18 → 259.14] Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
[259.80 → 261.64] If you are the Son of God, he said again,
[262.00 → 264.44] Throw yourself down, for it is written,
[264.94 → 267.04] He will command his angels concerning you,
[267.20 → 271.76] and they will lift you up in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against stone.
[272.98 → 273.84] Jesus answered,
[274.34 → 275.36] It is also written,
[275.88 → 278.12] Do not put the Lord your God to the test.
[278.12 → 285.34] Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour.
[286.04 → 290.14] All of this I will give you, he said, if you will bow down and worship me.
[290.78 → 291.82] Jesus said to him,
[292.40 → 293.76] Away from me, Satan.
[294.38 → 295.16] For it is written,
[295.82 → 298.02] Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.
[299.12 → 301.96] Then the devil left him and angels came and attended him.
[304.72 → 307.80] Now on an initial reading of this text this time around,
[308.12 → 315.20] It was weird how the phrase that stuck out to me was this little part of the sentence where it says that Jesus was hungry.
[316.30 → 323.20] I highlighted this specific part of my Bible because it sounded so real down to earth for me.
[324.36 → 327.14] So after fasting for 40 days and 40 nights,
[328.10 → 328.96] Jesus was hungry.
[329.50 → 330.36] That's just fact.
[330.72 → 333.04] That he was really human, that he was starving.
[333.04 → 340.06] And I remember a time when my dad, in preparation of his, I think it was ordination, but whatever it was,
[340.28 → 342.82] He did a whole 40-day fasting as well.
[343.20 → 345.06] Now I don't know if he did the whole 40 days,
[345.30 → 349.14] But during that time, no one was to go around his little prayer room.
[349.48 → 350.38] Like that was his space.
[350.44 → 351.84] It was really dark and gloomy there.
[352.24 → 353.76] And he didn't seem too happy.
[354.50 → 355.62] He was very hungry.
[356.10 → 356.78] Very human.
[356.78 → 365.96] And it was a reminder for me that it, or it showed me, of how Jesus our Saviour and the Son of God Himself that we glorify and worship,
[366.96 → 367.92] Was really human.
[369.34 → 374.88] He came, he became a human like us to be tempted and tested just as we are.
[374.88 → 381.90] And so with this real Jesus, who came to us as a real human being,
[382.42 → 388.02] Satan tempts Jesus, trying to split the relationship between Him and God.
[389.24 → 394.26] And this is what He does against us as well, through lies and deception again.
[394.86 → 398.88] And specifically, the lie or the twisting of the truth is,
[399.46 → 402.12] Our own God-given desire for goodness.
[402.12 → 409.32] And I would argue that every human being made in the image of God has this deep desire for goodness.
[409.84 → 411.54] This is a reflection of our designer.
[412.22 → 417.54] But what Satan does is he takes that natural, truthful desire for goodness,
[418.24 → 421.16] And he uses it to pull us away from God,
[421.22 → 424.62] Not to bring us closer in harmony and relationship with Him,
[424.82 → 425.88] Which is such an irony.
[426.50 → 428.34] Using the gift God gave us Himself,
[428.72 → 430.52] And using that to pull us away from God.
[430.52 → 431.82] And that's deception.
[432.80 → 437.04] Again, it's not a blatant or explicit lie telling you right in your face,
[437.40 → 439.20] Hey, betray God.
[439.54 → 441.56] Or betray your own convictions.
[441.96 → 443.70] Your own desires for goodness.
[445.06 → 448.90] Betray all that and live in a life of sadness and anxiety and depression.
[450.40 → 452.66] If that was Satan's method,
[452.66 → 457.14] I would think it would be a little bit easier to ward off.
[457.14 → 458.78] Because we know it's a lie.
[459.82 → 467.94] But why it's so deceitful is that he takes a snippet of truth again and twists it in a false idea or message.
[467.94 → 473.58] Before we get into the actual content of the temptations,
[474.22 → 478.74] Notice that Jesus is led into the wilderness right after the baptism.
[478.74 → 484.84] The conjunctive word that connects the chapter 3 to chapter 4 that we read is the word tote.
[485.02 → 486.06] It just means then.
[486.70 → 490.20] And it's a conjunction connecting Jesus' baptism
[490.20 → 494.22] And continuing straight into the wilderness for his temptation.
[494.22 → 498.40] Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.
[498.40 → 506.64] And this is important because there is a temptation to think that the natural or right path after being baptized
[506.64 → 510.86] Is now to live gloriously and triumphantly as new creation.
[511.92 → 513.72] That's the temptation to think that.
[514.00 → 516.02] That because I'm a Christian, everything is okay now.
[517.00 → 519.16] Just test that theory out right now.
[519.80 → 523.40] Was that the case for you after your baptism or your profession of faith?
[523.40 → 527.42] That all problems were gone and away with after you became a Christian?
[529.50 → 533.78] At the very least, Jesus, it wasn't the case for Jesus.
[535.40 → 539.26] God's Spirit himself leads Jesus into the wilderness
[539.26 → 542.94] So that he would be tested and tempted by the devil.
[544.54 → 546.18] God leads Jesus.
[546.46 → 548.46] God's Spirit leads Jesus into the wilderness.
[548.88 → 551.18] And so I had to ask and kept asking,
[551.18 → 556.64] Why would God let Jesus or lead Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted?
[557.02 → 559.06] And then flip that around for ourselves.
[559.76 → 563.40] Why would God let us be tempted and tested?
[564.26 → 566.90] In the prayer that Jesus himself teaches us,
[567.14 → 568.82] He says to pray like this,
[569.22 → 573.16] Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.
[573.48 → 577.10] So if that's our prayer, if that is our desperate desire,
[577.10 → 580.60] Then how come we are still tested and tempted?
[583.26 → 588.30] My hope this morning is that the answer is found as we faithfully witness
[588.30 → 591.46] To the temptations that Jesus himself faced,
[591.82 → 595.16] And more importantly, how he responded to these temptations.
[595.94 → 599.76] And so before expanding on that and answering the question here explicitly,
[600.18 → 601.76] Allow me to leave you in suspense.
[602.02 → 604.12] Because I promise you, based on God's Word,
[604.42 → 605.66] It is good news for us.
[605.66 → 608.60] So the first temptation,
[609.34 → 612.36] The tempter tests Jesus through a weak spot.
[613.42 → 613.88] His hunger.
[614.96 → 616.02] Very real human.
[616.36 → 617.60] Came to be tested like us,
[617.64 → 618.94] And he fasted for 40 days.
[619.14 → 619.98] Now he's hungry.
[620.44 → 623.24] And so Satan pokes at that weakness,
[623.58 → 626.66] And challenges Jesus' own identity.
[627.18 → 628.32] So what does he say here?
[628.62 → 629.02] He says,
[629.36 → 630.84] If you are the Son of God,
[631.24 → 633.74] Or another translation, you could even say it like this,
[633.74 → 636.58] Since you are the Son of God,
[637.16 → 638.00] Feed yourself.
[640.00 → 643.90] He's not saying here that you are not the Son of God, Jesus.
[644.64 → 645.90] That's not his deception.
[646.26 → 646.82] He's saying,
[647.46 → 648.62] You are the Son of God.
[648.74 → 649.98] I know that you believe,
[650.06 → 651.52] You think you are the Son of God.
[651.68 → 652.74] So prove it.
[653.50 → 654.58] Prove it for yourself.
[655.54 → 657.12] You've now just been baptized,
[657.46 → 659.82] Anointed as the Messiah to save the whole world.
[659.82 → 662.76] Making stones into bread should be nothing.
[662.90 → 664.50] I mean, you did it with the water into wine.
[665.46 → 666.72] This should be nothing for you.
[667.06 → 667.78] So prove it.
[667.96 → 668.82] Prove your identity.
[671.18 → 672.66] It's a twisting of the truth.
[673.06 → 676.36] Challenging Jesus' true identity as the Son of God.
[676.74 → 679.22] Do something spectacular so you know for sure.
[680.40 → 681.80] That's the temptation here.
[682.66 → 684.04] This might be a silly example,
[684.16 → 685.68] But as I was reflecting on this,
[685.68 → 686.64] It occurred to me,
[686.76 → 689.64] It would be like asking Lionel Messi,
[689.78 → 691.50] Like one of the greatest soccer players in the world.
[691.74 → 693.72] It would be like going and asking him
[693.72 → 694.88] To score a goal,
[695.10 → 696.68] Playing against a bunch of kids.
[697.06 → 698.48] Which sometimes it feels that way,
[698.60 → 699.64] Him playing in the MLS.
[700.02 → 700.68] No offence.
[701.12 → 701.34] But,
[702.06 → 704.10] It's like asking him to go score a goal,
[704.30 → 706.84] To prove that you're one of the greatest soccer players in the world.
[708.28 → 709.42] That's a silly question.
[709.76 → 712.20] Because Messi doesn't have to go score a goal,
[712.20 → 716.38] Playing against kids to prove his identity as a good soccer player.
[717.04 → 717.96] Unless what?
[719.44 → 721.02] Unless he doubts it.
[722.04 → 724.46] Unless he doubts his identity.
[725.22 → 726.98] And now turn this around on ourselves.
[727.60 → 731.88] If we doubt our own self-identity as God's children,
[732.74 → 737.22] We may be faced with temptations to try and prove our identity.
[737.22 → 740.04] Do something spectacular,
[740.58 → 744.22] So that you know for sure that you are really God's child.
[746.72 → 747.28] So,
[747.58 → 748.04] For me,
[748.28 → 749.88] Simply thinking about this,
[749.96 → 751.16] It was this simple phrase,
[751.66 → 754.28] Instead of loving because we are loved,
[754.82 → 757.34] Which would be to live out our God-given identity.
[757.86 → 758.00] So,
[758.36 → 761.12] Instead of loving because we are first loved,
[761.56 → 765.18] It would be like loving to be loved by God.
[765.50 → 766.94] Trying to prove that identity.
[767.22 → 769.80] So,
[769.80 → 771.00] So now we turn to our Saviour.
[771.86 → 774.28] How does Jesus respond in the face of doubt?
[775.18 → 775.94] Well, first,
[776.26 → 777.80] In all three temptations,
[778.20 → 780.84] Jesus uses the only weapon that he has,
[781.10 → 782.30] The sword of the Spirit,
[782.46 → 783.62] Which is the word of God.
[784.14 → 785.46] That's very important to note.
[785.86 → 788.02] Jesus quotes from Deuteronomy,
[788.10 → 789.58] A part of the passage that reads,
[790.22 → 791.18] He humbled you,
[791.68 → 792.80] Causing you to hunger,
[793.02 → 794.40] And then feeding you with manna,
[794.40 → 797.42] Which neither you nor your ancestors had known,
[797.96 → 799.70] To teach you that man,
[800.16 → 801.02] Or more literally,
[801.18 → 801.68] Ha'Adam,
[801.74 → 802.44] So the human,
[803.06 → 806.52] To teach you that the human does not live on bread alone,
[806.72 → 809.38] But on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.
[809.38 → 814.10] What Jesus is telling the devil is that God's children,
[814.76 → 816.54] And himself as the Son of God,
[816.90 → 819.02] Live in full trust in him.
[819.84 → 823.44] That we don't use our God-given identity for our own purposes.
[823.44 → 827.26] It is a calling to fully trust in God.
[828.32 → 830.56] And so in a response to a temptation of doubt,
[831.66 → 834.04] We can answer with Jesus,
[834.38 → 837.28] And stand against this temptation,
[837.74 → 839.22] Resist this temptation,
[839.76 → 840.36] To say,
[840.72 → 842.02] Are you really God's child?
[843.66 → 844.74] Yes, I am.
[845.82 → 848.68] I fully trust that God loves me,
[848.76 → 850.38] And that I am his child.
[850.38 → 855.14] We have our hope in our Saviour and our God,
[855.36 → 856.64] Who is the bread of life.
[857.84 → 859.28] He is our only hope.
[860.96 → 862.42] And then at this point,
[862.56 → 865.12] I picture Satan kind of responding like this.
[865.90 → 866.72] Alright, fine.
[866.84 → 867.70] Great comeback, Jesus.
[868.56 → 871.94] You're right when you say that you are to fully trust God as God's children.
[871.94 → 876.14] But if you say that you live by God's word,
[876.60 → 879.54] Then jump off the top of this holy temple here.
[879.86 → 881.72] Because the word that you quoted,
[881.82 → 882.92] I'm going to quote myself,
[883.32 → 885.72] From God's holy scripture itself,
[886.06 → 886.86] It says,
[888.36 → 890.66] He will command his angels concerning you,
[890.92 → 892.88] And they will lift you up in their hands,
[892.96 → 895.22] So that you will not strike your foot against the stone.
[895.22 → 899.44] Satan, I should say,
[899.74 → 902.82] Is using again a snippet of truth and perverting it.
[903.36 → 903.74] Saying,
[903.92 → 905.56] Hey, the Bible you quoted,
[905.68 → 906.62] I'm quoting as well.
[907.10 → 910.20] The Bible says that you will be provided and protected for.
[910.76 → 911.78] So jump off.
[912.34 → 915.00] Again, it's the same temptation, isn't it?
[915.60 → 916.58] Prove your identity.
[917.84 → 919.30] Prove you are the son of God.
[919.78 → 920.78] Because it says,
[921.06 → 922.84] God's children will be protected for.
[922.84 → 926.44] The key here,
[926.68 → 928.76] Just like the temptation from before,
[929.02 → 933.88] Is to know and name the purpose behind Satan's temptation.
[935.02 → 936.30] What's his purpose?
[936.64 → 937.86] What does he stand for?
[939.52 → 944.26] He is trying to split the relationship between God the Father here,
[944.40 → 945.32] And God the Son.
[946.04 → 948.22] That's the purpose behind the temptation.
[949.32 → 950.06] In other words,
[950.06 → 954.18] If Jesus were to try and prove his identity by jumping off a roof,
[954.44 → 955.04] And in turn,
[955.22 → 957.16] Forcing God to act to protect him,
[957.70 → 961.80] It would be to prioritize his own privilege as God's son,
[962.14 → 963.34] Over and against,
[963.50 → 963.74] Again,
[964.52 → 965.94] Fully trusting in him.
[966.66 → 967.96] Fully trusting in God.
[968.02 → 969.04] That's what we're called for.
[969.28 → 970.74] But here in this temptation,
[971.20 → 972.14] It's to challenge,
[972.42 → 973.68] And flip that hierarchy,
[973.90 → 974.84] And say,
[975.14 → 975.96] And tempting us,
[975.96 → 978.48] If you really are the son of God,
[978.52 → 980.10] If you are God's child,
[980.58 → 981.70] You have to prove it.
[982.34 → 983.56] Make God act.
[983.56 → 990.02] You could think that jumping off the roof,
[990.28 → 990.58] Now,
[990.66 → 991.32] When I was younger,
[991.44 → 994.22] This is sometimes how I thought of in this temptation.
[995.40 → 996.46] Jumping off a roof,
[996.54 → 998.46] Isn't that like taking a leap of faith?
[998.76 → 1000.26] Like literally and figuratively?
[1000.94 → 1002.76] That you're testing your own faith?
[1002.84 → 1003.84] You're not testing God.
[1004.08 → 1005.06] Why would Jesus say that?
[1005.28 → 1006.74] You're testing your own faith
[1006.74 → 1009.02] To see if you really believe in God or not.
[1009.02 → 1013.46] But in this context,
[1014.20 → 1016.98] The specific purpose behind Satan's temptation
[1016.98 → 1018.92] Is to flip that hierarchy,
[1019.12 → 1022.26] To split that relationship between God the Father and the Son.
[1022.72 → 1028.00] Because it really is a testing and manipulating of God
[1028.00 → 1029.74] To follow our agenda.
[1030.60 → 1032.66] Not to fully trust in him.
[1032.90 → 1034.14] So in a simpler way,
[1034.60 → 1036.74] It would be to simply ask here.
[1036.74 → 1042.12] Do we follow God and fully trust in him?
[1042.26 → 1042.78] Bless you.
[1043.74 → 1046.50] Do we follow God and fully trust in God?
[1047.00 → 1047.46] Or,
[1048.30 → 1052.06] Do we require God to follow us
[1052.06 → 1053.56] In our own agendas?
[1054.46 → 1055.96] That's the temptation.
[1056.34 → 1059.70] The latter is what the devil is trying to entice from Jesus.
[1061.74 → 1063.90] And then applying this to our lives,
[1064.28 → 1065.60] I think to myself,
[1065.60 → 1068.68] Do we not do that sometimes in our own faith journeys?
[1069.54 → 1071.84] Do we always trust in God,
[1072.02 → 1074.50] Even if life looks dark and gloomy?
[1075.82 → 1076.38] Or,
[1076.56 → 1081.12] Do we demand that God follow our agenda
[1081.12 → 1083.04] Because we have tithed enough,
[1083.28 → 1083.94] Prayed enough,
[1084.06 → 1085.04] Gone to church enough?
[1086.12 → 1089.70] Do we demand that God now follow our own agendas
[1089.70 → 1091.38] And somehow fix all of our problems
[1091.38 → 1093.32] Because we have done all these things?
[1093.32 → 1097.30] In our weakness and desperation,
[1097.30 → 1099.50] We seek God's healing and guidance,
[1099.60 → 1100.26] Of course.
[1100.82 → 1103.22] And this is out of trust in his ultimate wisdom.
[1104.34 → 1105.54] We fully trust in him.
[1105.66 → 1106.70] That is a truth.
[1106.98 → 1110.26] But do we sometimes even take this truth
[1110.26 → 1112.32] And pervert it in a way
[1112.32 → 1115.22] Where we require him to follow us
[1115.22 → 1116.44] Instead of us following him?
[1116.44 → 1120.14] And notice something very significant here.
[1120.38 → 1123.76] Because Jesus says that the most important commandments in the Bible are,
[1124.60 → 1125.30] Love God,
[1125.78 → 1126.36] Love neighbour.
[1126.66 → 1128.68] And I love how this commentator pointed this out.
[1129.02 → 1129.80] Simple fact,
[1130.18 → 1131.86] Jumping off the top of a roof
[1131.86 → 1133.22] And testing God
[1133.22 → 1135.18] Does neither of these things.
[1137.18 → 1139.46] Testing God by jumping off a roof
[1139.46 → 1141.76] Does neither loving God more
[1141.76 → 1143.60] Or loving our neighbours more.
[1143.60 → 1146.14] So what's the point?
[1146.78 → 1149.88] Well, the point was for Satan to try to split that relationship.
[1152.92 → 1155.66] And finally, we come to the last temptation.
[1156.22 → 1157.88] As one commentator titled it,
[1158.24 → 1160.86] Challenging Jesus' love for God's world.
[1161.98 → 1167.00] And this temptation is a challenge against the core of Jesus' own vocation.
[1167.00 → 1170.42] He came to save the world that was lost
[1170.42 → 1172.54] Because it was broken in sin.
[1173.90 → 1175.90] That was his job, you can say.
[1177.14 → 1178.52] And Satan here
[1178.52 → 1182.72] Is perversely offering that completion of the job
[1182.72 → 1184.04] To Jesus
[1184.04 → 1187.38] Only if he would bow and worship Satan.
[1188.86 → 1190.08] I'll give you this world.
[1190.16 → 1191.06] You came to save it.
[1191.14 → 1191.94] I'll give it to you.
[1192.30 → 1193.62] Just bow and worship me.
[1194.98 → 1196.56] Do you see the purpose behind it now?
[1197.20 → 1198.10] What's he trying to do?
[1198.40 → 1200.68] If Jesus were to bow down and worship Satan,
[1201.44 → 1202.44] That would be, again,
[1202.56 → 1204.86] Breaking that relationship between him and God.
[1204.86 → 1206.84] Because God is the only one
[1206.84 → 1210.62] Who is deserving of all praise and worship.
[1211.60 → 1212.94] Breaking of the relationship.
[1215.24 → 1218.02] Satan is tempting us as well,
[1218.12 → 1219.20] Like he did to Jesus.
[1220.00 → 1222.60] Tempting us to think that when we are successful,
[1223.32 → 1225.30] And when our work advances,
[1225.30 → 1229.92] Then the glory of God automatically advances as well.
[1230.18 → 1231.78] This is the subtlety here.
[1232.40 → 1235.82] It is one thing to do our best to be faithful to God's calling,
[1236.14 → 1238.58] Wherever he calls us to.
[1239.02 → 1240.40] Whatever he calls us to.
[1241.20 → 1246.24] The truth is that doing our best does reflect God's goodness through our lives.
[1246.24 → 1247.84] That is a truth.
[1247.84 → 1249.80] But this same truth,
[1249.92 → 1251.68] This same vocation or calling,
[1252.00 → 1254.40] Can be turned quickly into an idol
[1254.40 → 1257.04] When we would do absolutely anything
[1257.04 → 1259.08] To not let it fail.
[1259.08 → 1263.28] The lies that we sometimes believe,
[1264.00 → 1265.62] You need to be successful,
[1266.06 → 1267.82] Otherwise God will not love you.
[1268.16 → 1269.10] Or the lie,
[1269.54 → 1272.76] You are only as good as you are successful at your job.
[1272.76 → 1277.10] That is a blatant lie.
[1277.10 → 1278.96] But it's a deceptive lie.
[1279.10 → 1280.78] Because we can always think to ourselves,
[1281.04 → 1282.54] But I'm doing all this for God.
[1284.72 → 1286.74] This is all for God's glory, isn't it?
[1287.86 → 1289.48] No, it's not for my pride.
[1289.72 → 1290.98] No, it's for God.
[1291.36 → 1293.14] And we keep deceiving.
[1293.26 → 1296.36] We have the temptation of deceiving ourselves with that.
[1299.02 → 1300.82] We belong to God.
[1301.24 → 1303.46] And as Jesus proclaims from Scripture again,
[1303.58 → 1309.20] The ultimate truth is that only God is worthy to be served and worshipped.
[1310.80 → 1314.70] And this God that we worship loves us unconditionally,
[1315.18 → 1316.74] No matter where we are.
[1317.80 → 1320.42] And we are called to trust fully in Him.
[1323.14 → 1325.98] And then at the end of our passage,
[1326.10 → 1326.46] It says,
[1326.94 → 1327.92] The devil left Him,
[1328.12 → 1330.22] And angels came and attended to Him.
[1332.74 → 1335.72] So to fully loop back to the question that I posed earlier,
[1337.00 → 1341.32] Why does God allow Jesus and us in our own Christian journeys
[1341.32 → 1342.72] Go through temptations?
[1343.76 → 1348.06] What is the purpose behind God allowing us to suffer through temptations
[1348.06 → 1348.82] Is the question.
[1349.66 → 1351.84] And the answer to temptations is the question.
[1351.84 → 1354.18] And the answer to this,
[1354.26 → 1357.20] As we witness to Jesus facing His own temptations,
[1357.46 → 1361.64] We know, and our calling is to trust fully in God's ways.
[1362.12 → 1366.00] Because God's ways is with the purpose of testing us
[1366.00 → 1367.72] To build us up,
[1368.04 → 1371.86] To shape and equip us to live in His love.
[1373.60 → 1376.02] Satan's purpose is to tear down,
[1376.38 → 1377.56] Break apart relationships.
[1377.56 → 1380.90] God's purpose behind all that we go through,
[1381.10 → 1382.58] All that we would suffer through,
[1383.06 → 1384.32] Is to build us up,
[1384.92 → 1385.76] Strengthen us,
[1385.88 → 1386.48] Train us,
[1386.58 → 1388.82] Because our own sinful natures,
[1389.04 → 1390.96] Our own disordered desires,
[1391.40 → 1392.62] Our flesh we call it,
[1392.84 → 1394.70] The world that pulls us away from God,
[1394.78 → 1396.06] And the devil himself,
[1396.34 → 1398.70] That is always constantly trying to break down,
[1398.94 → 1399.72] And deceive us,
[1399.78 → 1401.30] And break our relationship with God.
[1401.30 → 1403.50] God knows that's what we face,
[1403.64 → 1408.00] And that's why God always strengthens us,
[1408.08 → 1409.78] By His Holy Spirit,
[1410.14 → 1411.74] To build us up,
[1412.66 → 1414.04] Not tear us down.
[1415.72 → 1416.94] In other words,
[1417.28 → 1420.22] God does not give us anything that we cannot handle,
[1420.54 → 1422.94] With the power that He gifts us with.
[1422.94 → 1426.52] That is the good news,
[1426.58 → 1427.00] Isn't it?
[1427.74 → 1430.76] Because Jesus did not suffer on the cross,
[1430.76 → 1432.46] To end in the grave.
[1432.82 → 1435.48] Jesus did not go and suffer through temptations,
[1435.56 → 1436.24] Just like us,
[1436.36 → 1438.12] To end up in doubt,
[1438.54 → 1439.80] In doubting His own identity.
[1440.92 → 1442.68] Jesus went through all these things,
[1442.94 → 1444.52] And defeated devil,
[1444.80 → 1445.36] And Satan,
[1445.56 → 1446.34] And the world,
[1446.52 → 1446.96] And sin,
[1447.10 → 1448.06] Once and for all.
[1448.06 → 1450.76] This Saviour,
[1451.86 → 1452.74] This Jesus,
[1453.14 → 1454.58] Is the one who is with us,
[1454.60 → 1455.44] And is for us.
[1457.64 → 1460.86] And since He has already defeated Satan,
[1461.76 → 1462.80] We are therefore,
[1463.44 → 1465.98] Even if we may feel like sometimes,
[1466.16 → 1467.82] Our trials are too challenging,
[1467.94 → 1469.66] Or too daunting for us to handle,
[1470.14 → 1471.74] We can overcome it.
[1471.96 → 1473.48] We can resist it.
[1474.12 → 1475.62] Not by our own strength,
[1475.62 → 1477.40] But by the strength of Him,
[1477.40 → 1479.84] Who empowers us by His own spirit.
[1480.96 → 1482.10] He is our hope.
[1482.48 → 1485.12] And we get to live into that same simple truth.
[1486.10 → 1487.34] Trust in Him.
[1488.06 → 1489.44] Trust in God's ways.
[1491.50 → 1494.58] And so as I want to conclude our message this morning,
[1494.64 → 1495.52] My message this morning,
[1495.92 → 1497.24] Three encouragements for us,
[1497.28 → 1501.56] As we face our real temptation through our real lives.
[1502.42 → 1502.78] One,
[1503.28 → 1504.32] First encouragement,
[1504.32 → 1507.38] Read and depend on God's word.
[1507.38 → 1508.70] This is our weapon.
[1509.26 → 1511.40] It is called the sword of the spirit in Ephesians.
[1512.66 → 1514.58] There is power in God's word,
[1514.86 → 1519.46] And there is power the more we rely and depend on our Saviour through His word.
[1521.06 → 1523.62] Jesus faced His temptations relying on Scripture.
[1524.48 → 1525.72] We are called to do the same.
[1527.40 → 1527.66] Second,
[1528.16 → 1531.12] Surround yourselves with other brothers and sisters of faith.
[1531.12 → 1533.62] There is power in community.
[1534.04 → 1536.90] You don't even need to be Christian to know this objective fact.
[1537.74 → 1539.60] There is power when you face struggles,
[1539.88 → 1542.10] When you are in community together.
[1542.66 → 1547.12] How much more power is there when you know that other brothers and sisters of faith,
[1547.26 → 1549.26] Who depend on God themselves,
[1549.62 → 1550.68] Are journeying with you,
[1550.76 → 1555.06] Are facing the same struggles and temptations that you are as well.
[1555.06 → 1557.50] We journey together.
[1557.68 → 1560.08] We are called as a family of God,
[1560.22 → 1561.64] Not just as individuals.
[1563.12 → 1563.70] And lastly,
[1564.52 → 1565.34] Through prayer.
[1566.44 → 1566.90] Prayer.
[1567.88 → 1570.76] Now it's not explicitly mentioned in our passage,
[1571.48 → 1573.20] But I think it's safe to assume
[1573.20 → 1577.68] That Jesus was not just hiking as He was doing His 40-day fasting.
[1578.30 → 1579.38] He was praying.
[1579.38 → 1583.34] He was abiding with His heavenly Father through prayer.
[1584.14 → 1586.16] Total dependence in Him.
[1588.04 → 1590.58] And these spiritual practices that are named,
[1590.66 → 1594.46] Among a bunch of other spiritual practices that we can do,
[1595.30 → 1599.08] These are not just some self-help methods just to get healthier.
[1599.40 → 1600.94] That's not the ultimate goal.
[1601.92 → 1603.90] See how even this truth can be twisted?
[1604.40 → 1607.10] If you're just wanting to end up being a healthier person,
[1607.10 → 1608.58] And that's the ultimate goal.
[1609.24 → 1610.12] Then at the end of the day,
[1610.18 → 1610.96] You might be thinking,
[1611.14 → 1612.18] Oh, I don't need God then.
[1613.64 → 1615.42] That's another twisting of the truth.
[1615.86 → 1619.14] But these habits of faith that we journey with,
[1619.92 → 1624.92] These are constant physical, mental, emotional, spiritual reminders
[1624.92 → 1627.18] That you belong to God.
[1628.18 → 1629.90] Reminders of your true identity.
[1629.90 → 1631.64] That you belong to Him.
[1631.98 → 1635.32] And that the devil's schemes and his lies and his temptations
[1635.32 → 1636.82] Are at the end of the day,
[1637.02 → 1638.06] They are pointless.
[1638.46 → 1639.36] They are powerless.
[1642.06 → 1644.64] So hope, abide with God,
[1645.16 → 1646.40] Through His word,
[1646.84 → 1647.74] With His people,
[1647.88 → 1648.68] And through prayer.
[1650.68 → 1653.96] For, and now I want to end by quoting Hebrews,
[1653.96 → 1657.40] For we do not have a high priest in Jesus,
[1657.96 → 1660.46] Who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses,
[1660.96 → 1663.94] But we have one who has been tempted in every way,
[1664.40 → 1665.44] Just as we are.
[1666.14 → 1667.64] Yet, He did not sin.
[1669.32 → 1673.14] Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence,
[1673.82 → 1677.24] So that we may receive mercy and find grace
[1677.24 → 1679.88] To help us in our time of need.
[1680.88 → 1681.32] Amen.
[1682.10 → 1682.58] Amen.
[1682.58 → 1683.22] Let's pray.
[1693.62 → 1694.44] Loving Father,
[1694.56 → 1695.62] We come before You
[1695.62 → 1698.20] In humility and independence,
[1698.84 → 1700.06] Because Lord,
[1700.68 → 1703.02] We can only face our trials,
[1703.16 → 1704.02] Our temptations,
[1704.38 → 1705.84] And we can only resist them
[1705.84 → 1707.94] By the power You allow us to have.
[1707.94 → 1712.52] So just as we prayed in our prayers of confession,
[1712.98 → 1715.68] Just as we have sung in our worship,
[1716.82 → 1718.22] Lord, we need You.
[1719.36 → 1720.82] We need Your love,
[1720.88 → 1722.08] And we need Your power
[1722.08 → 1724.04] To guide us,
[1724.86 → 1727.60] And to empower us through our everyday journeys
[1727.60 → 1728.42] As Your children.
[1728.42 → 1734.32] So I pray over all the temptations and addictions and brokenness over our lives,
[1734.56 → 1737.84] And that by the power You grant us in Your name,
[1738.36 → 1740.26] We would be able to face them,
[1740.52 → 1741.32] And resist them,
[1741.38 → 1745.00] And overcome everything with the hope that we have in You.
[1745.68 → 1746.98] You are our confidence.
[1747.48 → 1748.90] You are our only hope.
[1748.90 → 1750.96] We come before You
[1750.96 → 1753.58] In needing,
[1753.70 → 1754.88] In desperate need
[1754.88 → 1756.26] For Your guidance.
[1756.82 → 1757.44] Once again.
[1758.34 → 1759.64] We thank You for the truth.
[1759.98 → 1761.48] We thank You for this good news.
[1762.92 → 1764.22] We thank You for Your love.
[1764.44 → 1765.42] In Jesus' name we pray.
[1766.00 → 1766.28] Amen.
[1766.28 → 1770.22] I invite you to stand as we sing our song response.
[1770.22 → 1770.70] Amen.
[1770.70 → 1800.68] Thank you.
