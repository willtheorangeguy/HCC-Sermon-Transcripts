[0.00 → 4.10] What a wonderful day.
[4.42 → 8.14] And even as the sun is coming up, we get to celebrate, as James prayed,
[8.80 → 14.28] that we get to celebrate this beauty of inviting and welcoming new members of our church,
[14.50 → 17.54] grafted into this family that we get to grow together in faith.
[17.98 → 23.74] So it is a privilege for me to come and witness to God's word.
[24.34 → 25.84] And right now, during the summer months,
[25.84 → 29.08] we are preaching through a series called The Hard Sayings of Jesus.
[29.08 → 34.04] And so we're picking difficult, maybe more difficult passages that we wrestle with.
[34.64 → 40.06] And today, I get the light and fluffy topic of casting out demons, aka exorcism.
[40.64 → 44.52] And with that in mind, I think before we go anywhere,
[44.82 → 51.28] it is very crucial to start with the mindset that we have to look at each passage
[51.28 → 55.76] and the grand narrative of the Bible in its context.
[55.76 → 61.00] We can't just pick and choose passages that we like or avoid the ones that we don't like.
[61.80 → 65.98] And so with that in mind, even last week, Pastor Sid, I know we were away from the church camp out,
[66.06 → 67.38] but I listened to Pastor Sid's sermon.
[67.98 → 75.32] And it was so good that he provided us with the overall context of how Jesus sends out the 72,
[75.32 → 79.60] the missionaries to spread the gospel, the good message of salvation.
[79.60 → 82.40] And that was the downfall of Satan.
[82.82 → 87.44] And the important part of that passage, along the same lines as today's passage,
[87.78 → 93.34] is that we need to keep our focus and our eyes fixed on Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour.
[93.94 → 96.54] That's how Satan falls.
[96.68 → 97.70] That's what it means.
[97.70 → 106.66] And so like this, like last week, today's passage provides for us a sign of victory over the enemy.
[107.08 → 113.30] And it gives us a specific picture of Christ's identity and authority over the enemy.
[113.92 → 116.70] And so again, the key, the focus is Jesus.
[117.22 → 120.86] Surprise, surprise, everything's about Jesus in the Bible.
[120.86 → 124.76] And so if you have your Bible or follow along with me on the screen,
[124.92 → 127.82] we are going to read Luke chapter 11.
[128.14 → 132.20] We're back in Luke, and we read chapter 11, verse 14.
[134.34 → 137.86] Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute.
[138.50 → 142.36] When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke and the crowd was amazed.
[143.06 → 147.14] But some of them said, by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.
[147.14 → 150.96] Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.
[152.10 → 154.16] Now Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them,
[154.56 → 157.18] Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined,
[157.40 → 159.86] and a house divided against itself will fall.
[160.64 → 164.08] If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand?
[164.90 → 168.48] I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub.
[168.88 → 171.52] Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub,
[171.66 → 174.68] by whom do your followers drive them out?
[175.28 → 176.86] So then they will be your judges.
[177.92 → 181.08] But if I drive out demons by the finger of God,
[181.20 → 183.84] then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
[184.68 → 187.80] When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house,
[188.02 → 189.30] his possessions are safe.
[189.92 → 193.22] But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him,
[193.42 → 197.50] he takes away the armour in which the man trusted and divides up his plunder.
[198.28 → 201.42] So whoever is not with me is against me,
[201.42 → 204.90] and whoever does not gather with my scatters.
[205.24 → 206.90] And this is the word of the Lord.
[207.14 → 214.26] On initial reading of this passage that we just read, how does it sit with you?
[215.88 → 219.14] Do you wrestle with the question that I've wrestled this past week with,
[219.56 → 221.30] of what is demon possession?
[221.30 → 228.36] What does it mean when this seeming demon possesses this person to cause them to be mute?
[229.66 → 234.04] This question, specifically this question about demon possession and spirituality,
[234.04 → 238.48] can really pull our attention away from the focus of the text, can't it?
[238.48 → 244.70] We'll touch on that question of what it means to be demon possessed.
[245.24 → 247.68] But before getting any further into it,
[247.88 → 252.06] I think, and I suggest that the most important question to even start with here,
[252.26 → 254.32] as we read God's word again,
[254.70 → 255.72] is this question.
[256.04 → 259.82] What does this particular miracle of exorcism in this case,
[259.82 → 263.64] what does this miracle show us about who Jesus is,
[263.96 → 267.24] and what does it tell us about the good news of God's kingdom?
[268.44 → 273.70] And my hope is that that foundation is where we start with,
[273.78 → 278.36] and where it guides us as we receive this maybe more difficult text.
[278.36 → 284.56] So, thinking about exorcism and this battle between Jesus and Satan,
[284.94 → 287.40] has anybody seen this picture that's going to be on the screen?
[288.08 → 289.68] This is Jesus arm-wrestling Satan.
[290.00 → 291.06] Has anybody seen this before?
[291.50 → 293.42] If you Google like Jesus versus Satan,
[293.52 → 296.06] this is sort of one of the pictures that come up first.
[296.66 → 297.96] And in my youth days,
[298.22 → 300.16] many youth pastors, unfortunately,
[300.56 → 304.12] use this image a lot to teach us about spiritual warfare.
[305.30 → 306.86] And when I was young, I had no thoughts.
[306.86 → 308.62] I was like, okay, Jesus versus Satan, I get it.
[309.16 → 310.88] But then, as I grew in my faith,
[310.96 → 312.52] and then as I did some more studies,
[312.70 → 314.92] I have so many issues with this picture.
[315.80 → 318.04] Starting with, I'll start with a sillier one.
[318.12 → 321.44] The sillier issue that I have is that Satan is so ugly here.
[322.62 → 324.02] Now, my understanding,
[324.32 → 325.72] and what I would suggest is,
[325.94 → 328.62] Satan, if I were to ever draw a picture of Satan,
[328.86 → 329.92] would not be this ugly.
[330.54 → 331.58] Now, I'm a terrible drawer,
[331.66 → 333.90] so I couldn't express it in an image.
[334.36 → 336.14] But to describe it,
[336.14 → 340.22] it would be, Satan would be some sort of beautifully deceptive figure.
[340.82 → 341.84] Good to the eye,
[342.64 → 344.70] but in reality, deceptive.
[344.88 → 347.66] Pulling us away from shalom and righteousness.
[348.92 → 350.14] And so that's his mission.
[350.80 → 351.56] But in any case,
[351.70 → 354.84] I don't think a portrayal, an image would be as ugly.
[355.06 → 356.38] You can disagree with me,
[356.58 → 357.70] but that's my pet peeve.
[358.46 → 360.32] Now, along more serious lines,
[360.84 → 364.24] like in light of our passage that we read this morning,
[364.78 → 367.26] the more serious reflection I have from this picture,
[367.32 → 368.36] and why I don't like it is,
[368.62 → 371.80] because it portrays Jesus and Satan
[371.80 → 373.94] as if they're in some sort of equal fight.
[373.94 → 377.98] Like, it can give us a sense that
[377.98 → 379.54] if we're struggling in life, maybe,
[379.92 → 381.80] and we're struggling through our journeys of faith,
[382.08 → 383.42] it might give us a mindset of,
[383.86 → 385.18] oh man, I'm struggling so much.
[385.28 → 387.52] I guess Jesus' arm must be getting tired or something.
[388.30 → 390.02] As if this is an equal fight.
[391.08 → 391.48] Right?
[391.54 → 393.44] The good news from the passage that we read
[393.44 → 395.90] simply is that Jesus is Lord,
[396.06 → 398.30] and he's already victorious over the enemy.
[399.22 → 400.82] This is not a fair fight.
[401.76 → 403.66] And so that's why I have issues with this picture.
[403.90 → 404.54] You can take it down.
[404.60 → 405.62] It's not a pretty picture there.
[406.56 → 407.34] Thank you, Trevor.
[407.54 → 407.98] Or Lydia.
[409.64 → 410.64] And I must say,
[410.90 → 412.94] so wrestling with this more difficult passage,
[413.18 → 414.84] and especially this past week,
[415.62 → 419.04] this past week for me seemed to be full of spiritual insights
[419.04 → 420.56] and sensitivity for some reason.
[422.10 → 423.68] Relatively speaking to other weeks,
[423.96 → 427.04] I've had more conversations about spiritual realities,
[427.18 → 428.04] and it wasn't intentional.
[428.90 → 430.08] Believe me, it wasn't intentional.
[430.14 → 431.70] I didn't bring it up on purpose.
[432.08 → 435.24] But it came relatively more often
[435.24 → 437.82] that I talked about spiritual realities with Pastor Dave,
[438.00 → 439.12] and even with my dad,
[439.18 → 441.30] and his experiences with exorcisms,
[441.62 → 442.70] and spiritual battles.
[443.36 → 444.14] And then,
[444.34 → 447.40] I've been dreaming too much for my own liking,
[447.76 → 449.28] and I'm remembering too much detail.
[449.78 → 451.58] And it's actually stressed me out.
[451.86 → 453.22] And I'm talking this past week.
[453.22 → 455.64] At times,
[456.14 → 457.12] it felt overwhelming,
[457.56 → 458.36] and even frightening,
[458.74 → 460.76] to think about Satan and evil.
[462.82 → 463.60] But then,
[463.70 → 465.60] as I'm driving past this little church
[465.60 → 466.94] by the Langley Events Centre,
[467.26 → 468.88] there's a Canadian Reformed church there,
[469.14 → 471.84] and they have one of those old traditional church billboards,
[472.10 → 472.28] right?
[472.32 → 473.16] You know what I'm talking about?
[473.56 → 474.78] And they had this up there.
[475.10 → 475.50] It said,
[475.60 → 476.18] word for word,
[476.18 → 477.02] it says,
[477.46 → 480.42] the Spirit empowers us in our battle with evil.
[481.22 → 481.82] That's all it said.
[481.92 → 484.26] I guess they're doing some sort of spiritual warfare series too.
[485.68 → 486.98] But it occurred to me,
[487.04 → 487.82] and this, again,
[488.22 → 489.66] was all this past week,
[489.72 → 491.52] after we got back from our church camp out.
[492.60 → 493.84] And after reading that sign,
[493.92 → 494.78] it occurred to me
[494.78 → 497.32] that that's the simple gospel message
[497.32 → 500.04] from our maybe more difficult text for us.
[501.18 → 502.48] Jesus is Lord,
[502.48 → 506.38] and He's the one who holds all authority and power
[506.38 → 507.48] over the enemy.
[508.04 → 508.86] Do you believe this?
[510.52 → 512.22] His power and authority
[512.22 → 514.80] is expressed throughout the gospels,
[514.92 → 517.08] as we see in His healings and His ministries,
[517.38 → 518.94] showing us a glimpse
[518.94 → 520.66] of what the kingdom of God is like.
[520.98 → 522.70] And specifically from our passage,
[523.16 → 526.28] it shows us that He has power over Satan
[526.28 → 527.54] and all evil,
[527.54 → 530.80] and that there is no place for evil
[530.80 → 531.82] in God's kingdom.
[532.48 → 536.84] And so this miracle of exorcism
[536.84 → 539.66] is a sort of window that shows us
[539.66 → 541.54] Jesus is already victorious
[541.54 → 544.72] and just as important now for us.
[545.84 → 548.40] This same power is given to us
[548.40 → 549.62] through the Holy Spirit.
[551.12 → 553.28] Hence, the arm wrestling between Jesus and Satan
[553.28 → 554.98] is not an accurate portrayal.
[555.42 → 556.56] It's not a fair fight.
[556.56 → 559.08] And Jesus has already won victory
[559.08 → 560.34] through the cross,
[560.64 → 561.34] through His death,
[561.34 → 563.42] and then resurrection power
[563.42 → 564.70] that Pastor Dave mentioned
[564.70 → 566.28] as we celebrated baptism.
[567.14 → 568.50] There is power in His name
[568.50 → 570.36] because He has defeated death
[570.36 → 571.88] once and for all through the cross.
[573.46 → 575.00] And so keep that in mind.
[575.34 → 576.04] That is my hope.
[576.28 → 578.50] That is the foundation for a whole passage.
[578.50 → 584.46] So, now, what do we do with this demon issue?
[585.18 → 587.96] What does it mean when this person was mute
[587.96 → 590.26] because they were possessed by a demon
[590.26 → 592.22] that caused this condition?
[592.22 → 597.32] Do we interpret this as spiritual possession,
[597.32 → 598.72] spiritual attack,
[598.72 → 601.38] or, because we live in the 21st century,
[601.70 → 604.06] do we only view this and interpret this
[604.06 → 605.98] as some sort of childhood trauma,
[606.46 → 607.40] mental health issues,
[607.40 → 608.50] or whatever medical term
[608.50 → 610.16] that we want to label this as?
[611.16 → 612.14] So what is it?
[612.52 → 613.96] Spiritual or medical?
[613.96 → 619.94] Isn't it silly how I even distinguish those two things?
[620.62 → 622.48] And that's my suggestion this morning.
[622.56 → 624.76] Without simplifying this sort of debate too much,
[625.18 → 627.08] I suggest that this is both,
[627.24 → 628.08] this demon possession.
[628.76 → 630.40] It's not just spirituality.
[630.86 → 633.78] It's not just medical and modern medicine,
[633.90 → 634.96] however we define it.
[634.96 → 639.20] If you take one extreme over the other,
[639.46 → 640.38] you're missing the mark.
[641.14 → 641.44] Why?
[642.26 → 645.12] Because the Bible presents it to us in this way.
[645.56 → 647.40] It is the reality that the Bible,
[647.54 → 648.54] biblical writers tell us
[648.54 → 649.84] that this person was demon possessed.
[650.34 → 651.44] That's how they viewed it.
[651.44 → 654.16] And also, at the beginning, in Genesis,
[654.44 → 656.18] the way God created us,
[657.10 → 658.42] in our faith,
[658.54 → 660.64] we know that we were created
[660.64 → 663.78] as physical, biological, emotional,
[663.96 → 665.46] intelligent beings, yes,
[665.72 → 667.94] but we were also created in God's image
[667.94 → 669.40] as spiritual beings as well.
[669.72 → 672.66] That's what it means to be holistically human,
[673.02 → 674.38] the way God created us.
[674.60 → 676.52] And so to separate these things
[676.52 → 679.16] and put them in little neat boxes and say,
[679.16 → 680.68] oh, that's all spiritual,
[680.86 → 682.04] or this is all medical,
[682.50 → 683.54] is to miss the mark.
[686.02 → 688.34] And specifically in our cultural moment,
[688.44 → 690.16] again, thinking about the 21st century
[690.16 → 690.98] that we live in today,
[691.34 → 693.26] I think Satan loves it
[693.26 → 695.06] when we just box everything
[695.06 → 696.26] into simple categories.
[697.32 → 698.56] Like if we try to say
[698.56 → 700.34] that all illness and brokenness
[700.34 → 702.28] is just simply a spiritual issue,
[702.40 → 703.94] and then we just pray over it
[703.94 → 705.48] because the power of Jesus
[705.48 → 707.28] has power over the enemy,
[708.22 → 709.72] what happens when that demon
[709.72 → 711.20] is not cast out?
[712.54 → 714.34] And then flip it to the other side
[714.34 → 716.34] if we say that there's no such thing
[716.34 → 717.42] as spiritual attacks.
[717.74 → 718.68] See, it didn't work,
[718.68 → 720.38] so we have to go to the hospital.
[720.70 → 722.46] And all of our human ingenuity
[722.46 → 724.08] and all of our modern medicine
[724.08 → 725.78] has the capability of solving
[725.78 → 726.74] all of our issues
[726.74 → 728.16] and sicknesses and brokenness.
[728.86 → 730.96] That would be lying to ourselves as well.
[731.68 → 734.22] Because it is truth
[734.22 → 736.04] that we have not figured everything out.
[736.46 → 738.28] There is no way our modern medicine
[738.28 → 740.80] has all the answers for life's problems.
[741.00 → 741.72] If it were,
[742.36 → 744.74] why is our mental health crisis
[744.74 → 745.64] is getting worse,
[746.04 → 746.64] not better,
[746.86 → 748.26] in the 21st century?
[751.70 → 752.94] It would be as silly
[752.94 → 753.98] as telling somebody
[753.98 → 755.30] to not even pray
[755.30 → 757.24] because it's either a spiritual issue
[757.24 → 758.80] or to only pray
[758.80 → 759.70] not go to the hospital
[759.70 → 762.26] because it's only a modern medical issue.
[762.26 → 766.52] I know for a fact
[766.52 → 767.88] that even after a recent
[767.88 → 769.66] spiritual warfare series,
[769.84 → 771.00] what we call the Good Fight,
[771.38 → 772.94] we had many people
[772.94 → 774.34] come and share their stories
[774.34 → 775.12] and experiences
[775.12 → 776.60] of spiritual warfare.
[777.34 → 779.38] And I know that at our church,
[779.88 → 781.20] we are not ignorant
[781.20 → 782.60] of these spiritual realities
[782.60 → 783.64] and battles that we face.
[783.82 → 785.12] And the leaders of our church
[785.12 → 788.00] and those who are spiritually gifted
[788.00 → 789.70] are more than willing
[789.70 → 792.14] to serve and bless our community
[792.14 → 793.82] with their spiritual gifts.
[795.54 → 796.88] We do pray,
[796.98 → 798.60] and I want to put that very clearly,
[799.00 → 800.14] we do pray
[800.14 → 801.98] in the powerful name of Jesus
[801.98 → 803.50] against all enemies.
[804.32 → 805.40] But like last week,
[805.60 → 807.70] the point is not to use
[807.70 → 809.72] this power that we get
[809.72 → 811.54] for our own personal needs.
[812.50 → 813.44] The point
[813.44 → 815.48] and the focus of the passage
[815.48 → 818.26] is that we are called
[818.26 → 819.96] to trust in Jesus
[819.96 → 821.44] who is Lord over all
[821.44 → 823.76] and that Jesus is able,
[824.74 → 826.20] that Jesus is Lord.
[828.16 → 829.70] And so however we define
[829.70 → 830.60] this demon possession
[830.60 → 831.82] in our passage,
[832.56 → 833.76] the key and focus
[833.76 → 834.90] is that we trust
[834.90 → 836.44] and depend on Jesus Christ,
[836.52 → 836.94] our Lord,
[837.12 → 838.38] who has power
[838.38 → 839.94] over any brokenness,
[840.44 → 841.50] physical, spiritual,
[841.68 → 842.42] emotional, mental,
[842.42 → 843.14] or otherwise.
[843.42 → 845.40] Just like the prophet Jeremiah
[845.40 → 847.76] confessed in the Old Testament too.
[848.12 → 848.64] He says,
[849.24 → 850.00] Sovereign Lord,
[850.16 → 851.26] you have made the heavens
[851.26 → 851.82] and the earth
[851.82 → 853.08] by your great power
[853.08 → 854.56] and outstretched arm.
[855.00 → 856.70] Nothing is too hard for you.
[857.70 → 858.82] And then echoing this,
[858.96 → 859.84] describing Jesus,
[860.18 → 861.36] Paul says in Colossians,
[861.90 → 862.76] For in him,
[862.98 → 863.72] in Jesus,
[863.96 → 865.30] all things were created,
[865.62 → 866.32] things in heaven
[866.32 → 867.02] and on earth,
[867.40 → 869.08] visible and invisible,
[869.42 → 870.32] whether thrones
[870.32 → 871.00] or powers
[871.00 → 871.50] or rulers
[871.50 → 872.24] or authorities.
[872.24 → 874.14] all things have been
[874.14 → 875.54] created through him
[875.54 → 876.92] and for him.
[877.34 → 878.02] In other words,
[878.26 → 880.46] everything is in his hands.
[880.98 → 881.94] He is sovereign
[881.94 → 883.88] and he is Lord over all.
[886.76 → 888.00] So for us,
[888.58 → 889.70] that is the good news
[889.70 → 891.18] because whatever battles
[891.18 → 891.70] we face,
[891.84 → 893.14] spiritual or physical
[893.14 → 893.78] or otherwise,
[894.02 → 895.10] through all the valleys
[895.10 → 896.34] and hardships of life,
[896.66 → 897.68] we trust,
[897.92 → 898.92] we can trust
[898.92 → 900.64] that Jesus is able
[900.64 → 902.00] and that he will lead us
[902.00 → 902.96] to green pastures
[902.96 → 904.02] and quiet waters,
[904.08 → 905.02] as the psalmist says.
[906.38 → 907.84] That's the ultimate hope
[907.84 → 908.66] that we live with.
[908.96 → 909.76] And that's why,
[910.48 → 911.08] up to now,
[911.14 → 911.80] my whole sermon
[911.80 → 913.12] has been based on
[913.12 → 914.00] these two verses
[914.00 → 914.74] at the beginning.
[915.26 → 916.42] That's all we're given,
[916.98 → 918.12] that our ultimate hope
[918.12 → 918.78] is in Jesus,
[918.92 → 919.78] who has power
[919.78 → 920.46] over the enemy.
[920.80 → 921.26] That's it.
[921.66 → 922.54] No other explanations.
[922.94 → 923.40] We don't know
[923.40 → 924.54] how Jesus drove out
[924.54 → 924.90] the demon,
[925.20 → 925.90] what words,
[926.00 → 927.20] what actions he did.
[927.20 → 928.08] We just know
[928.08 → 929.28] that Jesus is able
[929.28 → 930.48] and he drove out
[930.48 → 930.90] the demon.
[931.22 → 932.28] And then the scene
[932.28 → 933.46] shifts straight
[933.46 → 934.78] to the reaction
[934.78 → 935.42] of the crowd,
[935.50 → 936.26] which is interesting.
[937.46 → 938.52] The first group
[938.52 → 939.02] of people
[939.02 → 940.40] challenge Jesus
[940.40 → 942.16] and they attribute
[942.16 → 944.40] Jesus' power
[944.40 → 945.32] to Beelzebub,
[946.16 → 946.76] saying that
[946.76 → 947.52] by the power
[947.52 → 948.34] of the prince of demons
[948.34 → 948.96] you drove out
[948.96 → 949.42] that demon.
[950.08 → 950.56] Logically,
[950.66 → 951.40] that's kind of stupid
[951.40 → 952.28] and Jesus says so.
[953.46 → 954.74] And then the other group
[954.74 → 955.10] says,
[955.26 → 956.16] okay, fine,
[956.16 → 957.26] if you're doing it
[957.26 → 958.32] by the power of God,
[958.44 → 959.90] then give us other signs.
[960.22 → 960.78] And they're trying
[960.78 → 961.50] to test him.
[962.20 → 962.84] And this word
[962.84 → 963.76] for test in the Greek
[963.76 → 964.70] is the same word
[964.70 → 965.86] that when Satan
[965.86 → 967.10] tests and tempts
[967.10 → 967.92] Jesus in the wilderness
[967.92 → 969.06] is exactly what
[969.06 → 970.00] this crowd is doing
[970.00 → 970.40] as well.
[971.24 → 972.14] And so what is significant
[972.14 → 973.06] is that both
[973.06 → 973.74] these groups,
[974.56 → 975.74] they're casting doubt
[975.74 → 976.90] on the authority
[976.90 → 977.80] and the identity
[977.80 → 978.70] of Jesus.
[982.74 → 983.84] Their questioning
[983.84 → 984.42] of Jesus,
[984.56 → 985.16] in other words,
[985.16 → 986.80] is what prevents them
[986.80 → 987.44] from making
[987.44 → 988.06] a commitment
[988.06 → 988.80] to Jesus.
[989.78 → 990.94] Notice the significance
[990.94 → 991.34] here.
[991.80 → 992.70] They are the crowd.
[993.32 → 994.44] They are not described
[994.44 → 995.16] in the Gospels
[995.16 → 996.38] as the disciples.
[997.80 → 998.66] They're the crowd
[998.66 → 999.26] that continues
[999.26 → 999.84] to doubt
[999.84 → 1001.26] and sit on the fringes,
[1001.48 → 1002.42] far from Jesus,
[1002.76 → 1003.66] far from committing
[1003.66 → 1004.14] to Him
[1004.14 → 1004.90] and becoming
[1004.90 → 1006.10] His actual disciples.
[1007.80 → 1009.06] So Jesus knew
[1009.06 → 1009.74] their thoughts
[1009.74 → 1010.98] and expands
[1010.98 → 1011.76] on what this miracle
[1011.76 → 1013.12] of exorcism means.
[1013.12 → 1014.82] He starts
[1014.82 → 1016.52] by pointing out
[1016.52 → 1017.50] the false logic
[1017.50 → 1018.16] in their argument.
[1019.44 → 1020.36] Why would Satan
[1020.36 → 1021.30] himself try
[1021.30 → 1021.98] to disrupt
[1021.98 → 1022.58] his own work
[1022.58 → 1023.12] by trying
[1023.12 → 1023.88] to tear down,
[1024.44 → 1024.98] which is
[1024.98 → 1026.82] to try and tear down
[1026.82 → 1027.80] and break apart
[1027.80 → 1028.36] relationships
[1028.36 → 1029.48] and break the beauty
[1029.48 → 1030.40] and goodness of God?
[1030.50 → 1031.26] Why would Satan
[1031.26 → 1032.52] go against his own mission
[1032.52 → 1033.64] of breaking that down?
[1035.64 → 1036.20] Notice,
[1036.48 → 1037.36] because all throughout
[1037.36 → 1038.02] the Gospels,
[1038.40 → 1039.34] Jesus' ministry
[1039.34 → 1040.22] is all about
[1040.22 → 1040.84] rebuilding,
[1041.26 → 1041.96] giving life,
[1041.96 → 1043.78] restoration of God's
[1043.78 → 1044.72] original design
[1044.72 → 1045.30] for humanity
[1045.30 → 1046.52] and all creation.
[1047.68 → 1048.92] So for Satan,
[1049.12 → 1049.70] whose mission
[1049.70 → 1051.28] is the exact opposite,
[1051.84 → 1052.92] why would Satan
[1052.92 → 1053.90] restore what is
[1053.90 → 1054.66] already broken?
[1055.10 → 1055.88] It just doesn't
[1055.88 → 1056.52] make sense.
[1058.26 → 1058.92] And so,
[1059.04 → 1059.80] with that in mind,
[1059.92 → 1061.00] if it really is
[1061.00 → 1062.36] by the finger of God,
[1062.42 → 1063.00] Jesus says,
[1063.10 → 1064.50] that I do this miracle,
[1065.38 → 1066.24] then what does that mean?
[1066.24 → 1067.68] It means
[1067.68 → 1068.54] the kingdom
[1068.54 → 1069.30] of God
[1069.30 → 1069.82] is here.
[1069.82 → 1071.96] this would have been
[1071.96 → 1072.96] so impactful
[1072.96 → 1073.94] for the people listening.
[1074.72 → 1075.64] The finger of God
[1075.64 → 1076.16] expression
[1076.16 → 1076.86] is actually
[1076.86 → 1077.36] a reference
[1077.36 → 1078.20] to the Old Testament
[1078.20 → 1079.00] in Exodus,
[1079.40 → 1080.24] where it references
[1080.24 → 1081.40] God's action,
[1081.72 → 1082.98] God's divine action
[1082.98 → 1083.78] for his people.
[1084.32 → 1084.56] And so,
[1084.64 → 1085.60] for the Jews listening,
[1086.32 → 1087.14] they would know
[1087.14 → 1087.62] that Jesus
[1087.62 → 1088.56] is being clear
[1088.56 → 1089.78] about his divine identity.
[1090.14 → 1091.14] By the finger of God,
[1091.18 → 1091.94] if I do this
[1091.94 → 1092.88] by the finger of God,
[1093.04 → 1093.70] then the kingdom
[1093.70 → 1094.54] of God is here.
[1095.12 → 1096.62] Just like his other messages
[1096.62 → 1097.80] all throughout the Gospels,
[1097.80 → 1099.28] what does he say
[1099.28 → 1100.46] as he begins his ministry?
[1101.48 → 1102.06] Repent,
[1102.30 → 1103.22] for the kingdom
[1103.22 → 1103.90] of God
[1103.90 → 1104.58] is here.
[1105.90 → 1106.88] Same message,
[1107.74 → 1108.64] same victory
[1108.64 → 1109.54] that he proclaims
[1109.54 → 1110.10] over the enemy,
[1110.26 → 1110.88] that the kingdom
[1110.88 → 1111.32] of God
[1111.32 → 1111.76] is here.
[1115.98 → 1116.54] Jesus
[1116.54 → 1117.52] is exhibiting
[1117.52 → 1117.98] authority
[1117.98 → 1118.64] over Satan.
[1119.36 → 1120.28] He's establishing
[1120.28 → 1120.90] earth
[1120.90 → 1122.02] as a place
[1122.02 → 1123.10] where righteousness
[1123.10 → 1124.62] can and does
[1124.62 → 1125.16] triumph
[1125.16 → 1126.24] over destruction.
[1126.68 → 1127.46] That's the kingdom.
[1127.80 → 1128.72] And that's why
[1128.72 → 1129.60] he teaches us
[1129.60 → 1130.02] to pray.
[1130.36 → 1131.18] And that's the first song
[1131.18 → 1132.08] that we sang together
[1132.08 → 1132.88] today this morning.
[1134.42 → 1134.94] Father,
[1135.16 → 1135.82] let your kingdom
[1135.82 → 1136.86] come on earth
[1136.86 → 1138.04] as it is in heaven.
[1138.78 → 1139.30] And so,
[1139.64 → 1140.20] lead us
[1140.20 → 1141.72] from the enemy.
[1142.92 → 1143.34] Lead us
[1143.34 → 1144.62] from the evil one.
[1145.22 → 1145.96] He teaches us
[1145.96 → 1146.34] to pray.
[1149.66 → 1151.02] What's interesting here
[1151.02 → 1151.98] is that Jesus
[1151.98 → 1152.84] now takes this
[1152.84 → 1154.02] one step further
[1154.02 → 1155.08] and gives us
[1155.08 → 1155.70] an illustration
[1155.70 → 1157.04] of what this victory
[1157.04 → 1157.56] over Satan
[1157.56 → 1158.18] looks like.
[1158.80 → 1160.14] We read in verse 21
[1160.14 → 1160.52] again.
[1160.98 → 1162.90] He explains this image.
[1163.20 → 1163.52] He says,
[1163.64 → 1164.58] when a strong man,
[1164.84 → 1165.54] fully armed,
[1165.96 → 1166.90] guards his own house,
[1167.20 → 1167.90] his possessions
[1167.90 → 1168.52] are safe.
[1169.36 → 1169.56] Now,
[1169.60 → 1170.00] I've wondered
[1170.00 → 1170.66] for a long time
[1170.66 → 1171.36] what that means.
[1172.14 → 1172.82] The commentator
[1172.82 → 1173.74] explained it very well
[1173.74 → 1174.08] for me.
[1174.34 → 1174.96] This is Satan,
[1175.04 → 1175.40] by the way.
[1176.54 → 1177.34] The strong man
[1177.34 → 1177.78] is Satan.
[1178.72 → 1179.58] But when someone
[1179.58 → 1180.54] stronger attacks
[1180.54 → 1181.70] and overpowers him,
[1181.96 → 1182.74] he takes away
[1182.74 → 1183.18] the armour
[1183.18 → 1183.82] in which the man
[1183.82 → 1184.22] trusted
[1184.22 → 1185.34] and divides up
[1185.34 → 1185.86] his plunder.
[1186.26 → 1187.34] This is victory
[1187.34 → 1188.38] over the enemy.
[1189.10 → 1189.62] And Jesus is
[1189.62 → 1191.28] using a familiar
[1191.28 → 1192.98] Jewish illustration
[1192.98 → 1194.30] to prove his point,
[1194.84 → 1195.90] to express his point.
[1196.42 → 1196.82] So,
[1196.90 → 1197.66] it might not be
[1197.66 → 1198.50] very applicable
[1198.50 → 1199.10] for us.
[1199.26 → 1200.14] We don't get
[1200.14 → 1200.94] the same impact.
[1201.10 → 1201.82] But for the Jews
[1201.82 → 1202.32] listening,
[1202.32 → 1203.08] they would have been
[1203.08 → 1203.72] very familiar.
[1204.26 → 1205.12] Because in other
[1205.12 → 1206.12] Jewish texts,
[1206.60 → 1207.42] there are similar
[1207.42 → 1208.10] illustrations
[1208.10 → 1210.30] of a Satanic being.
[1210.42 → 1211.26] They use different names
[1211.26 → 1211.92] like Belial.
[1212.44 → 1213.00] And today,
[1213.16 → 1214.26] we know the name
[1214.26 → 1214.52] of,
[1214.92 → 1216.60] what's the name?
[1216.72 → 1217.28] Beelzebub.
[1218.32 → 1219.24] But whatever the name
[1219.24 → 1219.64] may be,
[1219.72 → 1220.80] a Satanic figure
[1220.80 → 1221.88] is overcome
[1221.88 → 1223.62] and the power
[1223.62 → 1224.18] to tread
[1224.18 → 1225.02] over evil
[1225.02 → 1226.02] is gifted
[1226.02 → 1226.96] to the children
[1226.96 → 1228.80] of the great priest.
[1229.96 → 1230.78] Sound familiar?
[1232.16 → 1232.84] And so,
[1232.96 → 1233.34] for the Jews
[1233.34 → 1233.72] listening,
[1233.94 → 1234.66] they're thinking,
[1235.00 → 1235.56] okay, Jesus,
[1236.08 → 1236.72] are you saying
[1236.72 → 1237.34] then you're
[1237.34 → 1238.20] the great priest?
[1238.20 → 1240.40] Yes, exactly.
[1241.40 → 1242.72] Jesus is the Messiah,
[1243.08 → 1244.52] the great high priest,
[1244.62 → 1245.42] it says in Hebrews,
[1245.62 → 1246.38] that has come
[1246.38 → 1247.44] to defeat the enemy
[1247.44 → 1248.40] once and for all.
[1250.08 → 1251.26] That's the illustration.
[1251.60 → 1252.48] And it's the same point
[1252.48 → 1253.42] that he's driving in.
[1254.22 → 1254.64] But then,
[1255.44 → 1257.16] this is the challenging part,
[1257.26 → 1258.34] the second challenging part
[1258.34 → 1259.16] from our passage.
[1260.18 → 1261.40] With Jesus making
[1261.40 → 1262.50] his divine identity
[1262.50 → 1264.02] clear to his Jewish audience
[1264.02 → 1264.90] and now to us,
[1265.86 → 1266.64] his challenge
[1266.64 → 1267.68] to the crowd
[1267.68 → 1270.20] is for us
[1270.20 → 1270.96] to become
[1270.96 → 1272.24] his real disciples.
[1273.16 → 1273.74] Verse 23,
[1273.80 → 1274.44] our last verse,
[1274.74 → 1275.30] it says,
[1276.14 → 1277.48] if you are not
[1277.48 → 1278.20] for me,
[1279.20 → 1280.86] you are against me.
[1282.04 → 1283.14] There is no
[1283.14 → 1284.62] neutral middle ground here.
[1284.72 → 1285.28] Notice that.
[1286.60 → 1288.06] He does not offer
[1288.06 → 1289.26] us to just sit
[1289.26 → 1289.80] on the fringes
[1289.80 → 1290.48] and call ourselves
[1290.48 → 1290.92] Christians.
[1291.32 → 1291.90] He says,
[1292.24 → 1292.86] if you are not
[1292.86 → 1293.42] for me,
[1293.52 → 1294.52] you are actually
[1294.52 → 1295.62] against me.
[1296.10 → 1297.28] This is the crowd
[1297.28 → 1299.14] versus being a disciple,
[1299.52 → 1300.70] an actual follower
[1300.70 → 1301.24] of Christ.
[1301.50 → 1302.20] He's asking,
[1302.34 → 1302.86] are you willing
[1302.86 → 1303.80] to be with me,
[1303.90 → 1304.86] to be like me,
[1304.90 → 1305.84] and do the things
[1305.84 → 1306.46] that I did
[1306.46 → 1309.72] to be my disciple,
[1310.76 → 1311.72] real disciples?
[1312.24 → 1312.76] Or,
[1312.96 → 1314.24] are you just okay
[1314.24 → 1315.54] with being part
[1315.54 → 1316.14] of the crowd,
[1316.94 → 1318.02] continuing to doubt,
[1318.92 → 1319.54] and continuing
[1319.54 → 1320.14] to test
[1320.14 → 1321.12] if this Jesus guy
[1321.12 → 1322.20] is for real or not?
[1322.20 → 1325.52] And so for us,
[1325.72 → 1326.52] this serves
[1326.52 → 1327.30] as a reminder
[1327.30 → 1328.22] of our calling,
[1328.32 → 1329.30] just like the baptism
[1329.30 → 1329.66] did.
[1330.36 → 1330.84] Or,
[1330.98 → 1331.70] for some of us
[1331.70 → 1332.72] who are new
[1332.72 → 1333.62] to this Christian faith,
[1333.74 → 1334.80] this is an invitation.
[1336.10 → 1336.96] An invitation
[1336.96 → 1337.50] to what?
[1338.26 → 1340.12] To fully trust
[1340.12 → 1341.06] and follow
[1341.06 → 1341.66] in Jesus
[1341.66 → 1342.44] who is Lord
[1342.44 → 1343.06] over all.
[1345.88 → 1346.88] Our hope
[1346.88 → 1347.68] and foundation
[1347.68 → 1348.84] is in the gospel
[1348.84 → 1349.96] truth that everything
[1349.96 → 1351.50] is in His hands
[1351.50 → 1352.88] and that He
[1352.88 → 1353.56] is sovereign
[1353.56 → 1354.18] over all.
[1354.26 → 1354.78] Just like the
[1354.78 → 1355.72] Colossians passage,
[1356.10 → 1357.74] everything is in His hands
[1357.74 → 1360.20] and we can trust
[1360.20 → 1361.26] in that good news.
[1364.18 → 1365.34] And the same
[1365.34 → 1366.62] resurrection power,
[1367.58 → 1368.82] this same power
[1368.82 → 1370.26] is now gifted
[1370.26 → 1371.52] to His people,
[1371.66 → 1372.16] the church.
[1373.16 → 1374.02] And I want to say
[1374.02 → 1374.72] this as boldly
[1374.72 → 1375.24] as I can
[1375.24 → 1375.88] because Jesus
[1375.88 → 1376.82] says it boldly.
[1377.50 → 1378.12] He says,
[1379.20 → 1379.90] and He expresses
[1379.90 → 1381.24] that as we receive
[1381.24 → 1381.74] the power
[1381.74 → 1382.60] from the Holy Spirit,
[1382.70 → 1383.60] the same power
[1383.60 → 1385.96] that is more than able
[1385.96 → 1387.20] to defeat the enemy,
[1387.46 → 1388.20] this same power
[1388.20 → 1389.38] is now gifted to us.
[1389.68 → 1390.20] And now,
[1390.40 → 1391.30] as His people,
[1391.60 → 1392.40] there are nothing,
[1392.52 → 1393.38] there is nothing,
[1393.58 → 1394.74] there are no obstacles
[1394.74 → 1395.46] that can get
[1395.46 → 1396.18] in our way
[1396.18 → 1397.26] as we seek
[1397.26 → 1398.86] to build God's kingdom
[1398.86 → 1399.70] here and now.
[1400.76 → 1401.70] Nothing can get
[1401.70 → 1402.30] in our way.
[1402.30 → 1408.76] But what happens
[1408.76 → 1409.84] when we do
[1409.84 → 1410.88] run into failures?
[1412.28 → 1413.28] You can be all
[1413.28 → 1413.98] high and mighty
[1413.98 → 1414.82] on the pulpit here
[1414.82 → 1415.88] and preach the gospel,
[1416.04 → 1416.30] yes,
[1416.46 → 1418.06] but what happens
[1418.06 → 1419.30] when we run into failures?
[1419.64 → 1420.50] What happens
[1420.50 → 1421.58] when we feel like
[1421.58 → 1422.58] that power
[1422.58 → 1423.28] is draining?
[1423.84 → 1424.62] What happens
[1424.62 → 1425.82] when we actually think
[1425.82 → 1427.14] that Jesus' arm
[1427.14 → 1428.22] is getting tired
[1428.22 → 1429.10] and we doubt
[1429.10 → 1429.96] His powerful
[1429.96 → 1430.96] sovereign lordship?
[1430.96 → 1433.48] What do we do then?
[1434.40 → 1435.24] What are we called
[1435.24 → 1435.70] to do?
[1436.16 → 1436.68] Are we called
[1436.68 → 1437.46] to strengthen
[1437.46 → 1438.90] and tighten our grasp
[1438.90 → 1439.96] and become
[1439.96 → 1440.80] a little stronger,
[1440.98 → 1442.16] to pray a little bit more,
[1442.28 → 1443.50] to read the Bible more,
[1444.50 → 1445.22] and it'll solve
[1445.22 → 1446.04] all of our problems?
[1447.56 → 1448.36] No, yes,
[1448.46 → 1449.28] we are called
[1449.28 → 1449.92] to pray more
[1449.92 → 1450.84] and read the Bible more
[1450.84 → 1452.32] as Jesus calls us
[1452.32 → 1454.00] to be His real disciples.
[1454.30 → 1454.86] But again,
[1455.02 → 1456.20] it's not to use
[1456.20 → 1457.46] this power somehow
[1457.46 → 1459.28] and energize ourselves
[1459.28 → 1460.34] and recharge our battery
[1460.34 → 1461.68] and then defeat the enemy.
[1463.82 → 1465.36] The call that Jesus
[1465.36 → 1466.62] extends to us
[1466.62 → 1468.72] is to remain in Him,
[1469.36 → 1470.22] not to become,
[1470.46 → 1471.32] not to put the label
[1471.32 → 1471.76] of Christianity
[1471.76 → 1472.60] on ourselves
[1472.60 → 1472.96] and say,
[1473.26 → 1473.92] now I can do
[1473.92 → 1474.60] whatever I can,
[1474.78 → 1476.22] whatever I want.
[1479.00 → 1480.08] This commentator
[1480.08 → 1481.30] says it much better
[1481.30 → 1481.88] than I do,
[1482.08 → 1483.04] and it'll be on the screen
[1483.04 → 1483.48] for you.
[1483.82 → 1484.38] He says that
[1484.38 → 1485.90] if failure occurs,
[1485.90 → 1487.72] it is not because
[1487.72 → 1488.42] enablement
[1488.42 → 1489.56] or empowerment
[1489.56 → 1490.98] has not been provided,
[1491.42 → 1492.44] but it's because
[1492.44 → 1493.74] we fail to make use
[1493.74 → 1494.42] of the victory
[1494.42 → 1495.48] Jesus provides.
[1496.28 → 1497.26] In other words,
[1497.74 → 1498.54] this passage
[1498.54 → 1499.34] that we read today
[1499.34 → 1500.00] in Luke 11
[1500.00 → 1501.58] becomes the basis,
[1501.92 → 1502.74] and I love this,
[1503.14 → 1504.18] it becomes the basis
[1504.18 → 1504.84] of Jesus'
[1505.24 → 1507.30] declaration of dependence.
[1507.30 → 1510.20] You get the reference,
[1510.76 → 1512.06] declaration of dependence.
[1512.78 → 1513.76] Unlike some nations
[1513.76 → 1514.42] and people
[1514.42 → 1515.52] who pride themselves
[1515.52 → 1517.00] on being totally free
[1517.00 → 1517.88] and independent,
[1518.78 → 1519.80] Jesus' community,
[1520.44 → 1521.10] the church,
[1521.86 → 1522.96] sees its identity
[1522.96 → 1524.14] in having been rescued
[1524.14 → 1524.74] by Him
[1524.74 → 1526.44] and thus permanently
[1526.44 → 1528.08] aligned to Him.
[1528.58 → 1530.00] We are His disciples.
[1531.64 → 1533.00] Total dependence,
[1533.56 → 1535.16] commitment to following Jesus
[1535.16 → 1536.32] and being His disciple.
[1537.34 → 1539.46] And so receive this invitation
[1539.46 → 1540.44] from Jesus again.
[1541.00 → 1542.14] He says in John 15,
[1542.50 → 1543.44] Remain in me
[1543.44 → 1544.64] as I remain in you,
[1544.88 → 1546.04] because no branch
[1546.04 → 1547.84] can bear fruit by itself.
[1548.14 → 1549.50] It must remain
[1549.50 → 1550.44] in the vine.
[1551.00 → 1553.10] You cannot bear fruit.
[1553.34 → 1554.50] You cannot overcome
[1554.50 → 1556.50] the enemy on your own.
[1556.60 → 1557.76] No matter how much
[1557.76 → 1558.32] you exercise,
[1558.72 → 1559.72] no matter how strong
[1559.72 → 1560.48] you think you are,
[1560.74 → 1562.30] you must let go
[1562.30 → 1563.62] and you must remain
[1563.62 → 1566.12] in the sovereign Lord
[1566.12 → 1566.70] and Saviour,
[1566.90 → 1567.68] Jesus Christ.
[1568.42 → 1570.06] That's what it means
[1570.06 → 1571.68] to become His disciple.
[1572.94 → 1574.08] That is our encouragement
[1574.08 → 1575.44] and invitation this morning.
[1576.84 → 1577.92] So follow Jesus
[1577.92 → 1579.62] and trust in Him
[1579.62 → 1580.88] who is more powerful
[1580.88 → 1582.78] than anything we face.
[1583.30 → 1583.50] Amen?
[1584.16 → 1584.86] Amen.
[1585.90 → 1587.30] Will you join me in prayer?
[1587.30 → 1587.42] Amen.
[1587.42 → 1587.84] Amen.
[1587.84 → 1587.92] Amen.
[1587.92 → 1588.04] Amen.
[1588.04 → 1588.42] Amen.

[1588.48 → 1588.58] Amen.
[1588.58 → 1588.84] Amen.
[1588.84 → 1589.40] Amen.
[1589.40 → 1589.46] Amen.
[1589.46 → 1589.50] Amen.
[1589.50 → 1589.52] Amen.
[1593.62 → 1594.26] Amen.
[1594.26 → 1594.62] Amen.
[1594.62 → 1595.30] Amen.
[1595.30 → 1595.54] Amen.
[1595.66 → 1595.82] Amen.
[1595.82 → 1596.66] Amen.
[1596.66 → 1597.08] Amen.
[1597.66 → 1597.80] Amen.
[1597.80 → 1597.92] Amen.
[1598.62 → 1598.82] Amen.
[1598.82 → 1598.92] Amen.
[1598.92 → 1599.20] Amen.
[1599.20 → 1599.58] Amen.
[1599.94 → 1600.26] Amen.
[1600.26 → 1601.26] Amen.
[1601.26 → 1601.50] Amen.
[1601.50 → 1602.40] Amen.
[1602.40 → 1603.26] Amen.
[1603.26 → 1604.14] Amen.
[1613.42 → 1613.92] Amen.
[1613.92 → 1615.52] Amen.
[1615.52 → 1615.90] Amen.
[1615.90 → 1617.44] Amen.
[1617.44 → 1617.92] Amen.
[1617.92 → 1618.48] Amen.
[1618.48 → 1619.40] Amen.
[1619.40 → 1619.46] Amen.
[1619.46 → 1620.42] Amen.
[1620.42 → 1621.44] Amen.
[1621.46 → 1621.56] Amen.
[1621.56 → 1622.48] Amen.
[1622.48 → 1622.60] Amen.
[1622.60 → 1623.44] Amen.
[1623.44 → 1623.60] Amen.
[1623.60 → 1627.84] may we learn to trust in you, Lord.
[1628.84 → 1631.08] May we be humble enough
[1631.08 → 1635.62] to not try and solve all of our problems on our own,
[1636.28 → 1638.74] but to be your disciple,
[1639.26 → 1642.30] to be real followers with our whole lives,
[1643.14 → 1644.26] whatever we may face.
[1645.50 → 1647.86] So will you bless our church?
[1648.26 → 1650.48] Will you bless us so that we may be a light
[1650.48 → 1652.34] and a blessing to others
[1652.34 → 1654.66] who are going through spiritual battles,
[1654.66 → 1658.82] who are going through hardships of all kinds.
[1659.40 → 1662.98] May we be powerful lights in your name
[1662.98 → 1668.32] to be a blessing to overcome as you allow us to.
[1669.70 → 1672.80] So with this, we give you all the glory, Lord,
[1673.20 → 1675.30] and we praise your name for overcoming.
[1676.72 → 1678.82] In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
