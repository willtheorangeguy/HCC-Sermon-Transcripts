[2190.66 → 2193.62] He is the treasure.
[2194.62 → 2197.22] He is the answer.
[2197.22 → 2198.22] He is the treasure.
[2198.22 → 2199.22] He is the treasure.
[2199.22 → 2203.22] Oh, I choose the Jesus way.

[2207.22 → 2210.22] I choose to love.
[2210.22 → 2216.22] Oh, God, my Saviour, you'll always be enough.
[2216.22 → 2221.22] I choose forgiveness.
[2221.22 → 2223.22] I choose grace.
[2223.22 → 2228.22] I choose to worship.
[2228.22 → 2231.22] No matter what I face.

[2250.22 → 2253.22] I follow Jesus.
[2253.22 → 2256.22] He wore my sin.
[2256.22 → 2260.22] I'll gladly wear His name.
[2260.22 → 2263.22] He is the treasure.
[2263.22 → 2267.22] He is the answer.
[2267.22 → 2268.22] He is the answer.
[2268.22 → 2269.22] Oh, I choose the Jesus way.
[2269.22 → 2274.22] I choose the Jesus way.
[2274.22 → 2277.22] I follow Jesus.
[2277.22 → 2278.22] I follow Jesus.
[2278.22 → 2280.22] I follow Jesus.
[2280.22 → 2283.22] He wore my sin.
[2283.22 → 2287.22] I'll gladly wear His name.
[2287.22 → 2289.22] He is the treasure.
[2289.22 → 2292.22] He is the answer.
[2292.22 → 2295.22] He is the answer.
[2295.22 → 2305.22] Oh, I choose the Jesus way.
[2305.22 → 2310.22] I choose the Jesus way.
[2310.22 → 2319.22] All right.
[2319.22 → 2324.22] We need all of our Cornerstone children to come up to the front, right in the middle here at this spot.
[2324.22 → 2328.22] So if you're off to Cornerstone in a minute, I want you all first to come to the front.
[2328.22 → 2330.22] We need you to help us in this worship service.
[2330.22 → 2331.22] So right here.
[2331.22 → 2334.22] We'll avoid the cellos, avoid the violins, right in the centre.
[2334.22 → 2339.22] This is also our secret way of creating seating for some of us who are standing.
[2339.22 → 2341.22] All right.
[2341.22 → 2344.22] Right here in the middle.
[2344.22 → 2351.22] So when I was a kid, we had this tradition where the kids helped us in worship.
[2351.22 → 2354.22] And this is what we're going to do.
[2354.22 → 2357.22] Our Cornerstone kids and our junior youth are going to say,
[2357.22 → 2358.22] Christ is risen.
[2358.22 → 2360.22] And you're going to say, He's risen indeed.
[2360.22 → 2362.22] And they're going to say it as loudly as they can.
[2362.22 → 2364.22] And you're going to do your best to say it even louder than them.
[2364.22 → 2366.22] So we're doing this through twice.
[2366.22 → 2367.22] We get the assignment?
[2367.22 → 2370.22] I think the kids are going to take it again, just like they did in the nine of them.
[2370.22 → 2371.22] So here we go.
[2371.22 → 2373.22] One, two, three.
[2373.22 → 2374.22] Christ is risen.
[2374.22 → 2375.22] He is risen indeed.
[2375.22 → 2376.22] Christ is risen.
[2376.22 → 2377.22] He is risen indeed.
[2377.22 → 2378.22] Christ is risen.
[2378.22 → 2379.22] He is risen indeed.
[2379.22 → 2380.22] Christ is risen.
[2380.22 → 2381.22] He is risen indeed.
[2381.22 → 2382.22] Amen.
[2382.22 → 2387.22] You are invited upstairs to Cornerstone.
[2387.22 → 2392.22] If you're visiting, and you have a child, grade three, age three to grade three,
[2392.22 → 2421.22] they're also invited upstairs to the Cornerstone room.
[2421.22 → 2422.22] Christ is risen.
[2422.22 → 2423.22] Christ is risen.
[2423.22 → 2424.22] Let's pray together.
[2424.22 → 2426.22] Christ is risen.
[2426.22 → 2429.22] Christ is risen.
[2429.22 → 2431.22] Christ is risen.
[2431.22 → 2432.22] Christ is risen.
[2432.22 → 2433.22] Christ is risen.
[2433.22 → 2436.22] My name is Mark and I will be leading the community prayer today.
[2436.22 → 2438.22] Let's pray together.
[2438.22 → 2442.22] Father in heaven, we are thankful that we can gather here today.
[2442.22 → 2444.22] Because today is a special day.
[2444.22 → 2447.22] A day when we can joyfully celebrate that Jesus is risen.
[2447.22 → 2451.80] Father today not only do we celebrate, but we remember
[2451.80 → 2458.52] We remember that while we were still sinners broken and unworthy having turned our backs on you and your love
[2458.52 → 2461.98] You sent your son to save us to die on the cross
[2461.98 → 2470.48] On Good Friday we recognize that Jesus your son did not deserve to die but took on our punishment instead
[2470.48 → 2474.54] Today we remember and celebrate the fact that Jesus has risen
[2474.54 → 2480.86] You have saved us from our sin and brokenness and prepared the way through death and out the other side
[2480.86 → 2488.44] We are now able to follow Jesus through death and to eternal life in perfect relationship with you
[2488.44 → 2489.50] Thank you
[2489.50 → 2497.80] Though we are now freed from the enslavement of sin we so often relapse into the old ways of sinfulness
[2497.80 → 2504.80] We forget about you God caught up in our routines in and in the patterns of the world
[2504.80 → 2509.08] We keep drifting farther and farther from the path you have set out for us
[2509.08 → 2515.84] Although you have sent your Holy Spirit to help us we so often are too arrogant to accept that help
[2515.84 → 2518.10] Forgive us for these shortcomings
[2518.10 → 2527.54] But today is a day of celebration for you Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour have brought healing and hope to every single one of us
[2527.54 → 2531.80] And
[2531.80 → 2533.52] We
[2533.52 → 2536.76] Pour out our praise to you Jesus our Lord and King
[2536.76 → 2540.14] This gospel is perfect news
[2540.14 → 2544.28] Therefore we gladly offer ourselves as your hands and feet
[2544.28 → 2547.32] Give us the strength to
[2547.32 → 2555.22] Do what is right and plant the seeds of the gospel in the hearts of all those we meet may our joy and love stand out
[2555.96 → 2560.32] Among our peers this week as a beacon pointing to the way of life that you offer us
[2560.74 → 2566.56] Give us the strength to be bold and strong in your love and grace as we navigate our lives this week
[2567.90 → 2573.78] We know that there are many people who are struggling in our community Lord, and we lift those who are sick or injured
[2574.28 → 2579.74] Specifically we lift Dave and Lois Clausen is Dave has received a pacemaker
[2579.74 → 2581.96] But there have been some complications
[2582.52 → 2587.96] We pray that these complications would be resolved and Dave would be able to return home
[2588.52 → 2593.80] We also pray for John Vandergraaf as he's undergoing tests for health issues
[2594.14 → 2599.04] We pray for healing for all these people in our community and comfort for them and their families
[2599.84 → 2601.84] Amen
[2604.28 → 2620.74] You know last year during Easter I lost my voice because we had two services lots of singing and I said to myself
[2620.74 → 2625.08] I'm not going to do that this year and here I am losing my voice and I haven't even finished the sermon yet
[2625.08 → 2626.40] And it's not even a short sermon
[2626.40 → 2627.74] So you're in trouble
[2627.74 → 2629.40] Or I'm in trouble
[2629.40 → 2632.48] I want to say thank you to all of our musicians
[2632.48 → 2633.78] What a gift
[2633.78 → 2638.98] It's very hard not to sing when we're led by these strings, and I'm very grateful for the gift of music in our church
[2638.98 → 2641.48] If you're new to our church, my name is Dave
[2641.48 → 2647.32] I'm one of the pastors here on staff, and it's a privilege to have you here to celebrate what we believe is the most important event in history
[2647.32 → 2651.38] The event that changes the course of history and that's the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[2651.38 → 2655.88] A number of weeks ago we began a sermon series called the good fight
[2655.88 → 2661.00] And we focused on Ephesians 2 and at that time if you remember back six weeks ago
[2661.00 → 2665.22] We said to everyone make a challenge to memorize Ephesians chapter 2
[2665.22 → 2670.76] And we invited our kids into it and I have I'm going to invite a woman named Rita Ago up to the stage
[2670.76 → 2675.76] Because she has bravely said that she will recite Ephesians 2 this morning with us
[2675.76 → 2678.64] And we're going to be very generous if there are any moments where she doesn't remember it
[2678.64 → 2682.34] So here she is Rita's going to recite it, and we're going to hear God's word together
[2682.34 → 2690.58] We realize that she can cheat by looking at that screen over there, but she's not going to
[2690.58 → 2700.52] I know so yeah we received that email around February, and it says as a challenge for Lent
[2700.52 → 2705.98] Go ahead and memorize these verses and I looked at it, and I'm like are you crazy?
[2705.98 → 2712.60] That's a lot the only thing I know about this passage is that for I am saved by grace
[2712.60 → 2719.28] But then four weeks ago this was in the insert the bulletin insert
[2719.28 → 2723.22] And it was broken down into four weeks
[2723.22 → 2726.32] And I said well maybe I can do it
[2726.32 → 2730.98] And I've tried and each night I memorized it
[2730.98 → 2736.54] And it became a source of like laughter in the house with my husband trying to you know spot check me
[2736.54 → 2742.12] But the more I spend time memorizing the words
[2742.12 → 2747.60] The more I realize that I am meditating on these words in a very different way
[2747.60 → 2752.26] It's really different when you're reading off of the Bible
[2752.26 → 2757.98] As opposed to pulling it out of your memory and really putting it in your heart
[2757.98 → 2764.82] And so Thursday Dave caught wind that I've memorized it
[2764.82 → 2766.84] Don't tell Jonathan anything
[2766.84 → 2770.04] Or else you'll be called to be up here
[2770.04 → 2772.76] But I am doing it for the Lord
[2772.76 → 2777.40] So bear with me and I will do it with my eyes closed
[2777.40 → 2780.98] As for you
[2780.98 → 2784.28] You were dead in your transgressions and sins
[2784.28 → 2786.54] In which you used to live
[2786.54 → 2790.18] When you followed the ways of this world
[2790.18 → 2793.50] And of the ruler of the kingdom of the air
[2793.50 → 2798.36] The spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient
[2798.36 → 2803.10] All of us also lived among them at one time
[2803.10 → 2806.02] Gratifying the cravings of our flesh
[2806.02 → 2809.60] And following its desires and thoughts
[2809.60 → 2811.42] Like the rest
[2811.42 → 2814.66] We were by nature deserving of wrath
[2814.66 → 2816.72] But God
[2816.72 → 2819.78] But because of his great love for us
[2819.78 → 2822.20] God who is rich in mercy
[2822.20 → 2825.06] Made us alive with Christ
[2825.06 → 2828.22] Even when we were dead in transgressions
[2828.22 → 2830.48] It is by grace
[2830.48 → 2832.34] You have been saved
[2832.34 → 2835.80] And God raised us up with Christ
[2835.80 → 2838.32] And seated us with him
[2838.32 → 2840.30] In the heavenly realms
[2840.30 → 2841.60] In Christ Jesus
[2841.60 → 2844.78] In order that in the coming ages
[2844.78 → 2846.82] He might show
[2846.82 → 2849.68] The incomparable riches of his grace
[2849.68 → 2853.58] Expressed in his kindness to us
[2853.58 → 2854.84] In Christ Jesus
[2854.84 → 2858.30] For it is by grace
[2858.30 → 2859.94] You have been saved
[2859.94 → 2861.40] Through faith
[2861.40 → 2863.80] And it is not from yourselves
[2863.80 → 2866.30] It is the gift of God
[2866.30 → 2870.18] In order that
[2870.18 → 2872.32] In
[2872.32 → 2874.66] It is a gift from God
[2874.66 → 2877.74] Not by works
[2877.74 → 2880.44] So that no one can boast
[2880.44 → 2883.92] For we are God's handiwork
[2883.92 → 2886.06] Created in Christ Jesus
[2886.06 → 2887.46] To do good works
[2887.46 → 2889.02] Which God
[2889.02 → 2891.38] Has prepared in advance
[2891.38 → 2892.52] For us to do
[2892.52 → 2893.88] Amen
[2893.88 → 2894.88] Amen
[2894.88 → 2896.38] Thank you
[2896.38 → 2899.28] I'm going to die now
[2899.28 → 2907.76] Well not that long ago
[2907.76 → 2908.64] A friend of mine
[2908.64 → 2910.16] Went through the long journey
[2910.16 → 2911.38] Of putting his mother
[2911.38 → 2912.22] Into a care home
[2912.22 → 2913.94] And I have a feeling
[2913.94 → 2914.72] A number of you know
[2914.72 → 2915.30] That journey
[2915.30 → 2916.04] It's not easy
[2916.04 → 2916.74] When your parents
[2916.74 → 2917.50] Get to a certain age
[2917.50 → 2918.06] Where they're no longer
[2918.06 → 2918.90] To live on their own
[2918.90 → 2919.84] And in his case
[2919.84 → 2921.20] His mother had dementia
[2921.20 → 2922.36] And so there's a lot of grief
[2922.36 → 2923.38] A lot of forgetfulness
[2923.38 → 2924.26] A lot of confusion
[2924.26 → 2926.24] But the day finally came
[2926.24 → 2927.24] When they moved her
[2927.24 → 2928.02] Into the care home
[2928.02 → 2928.98] Near her son's home
[2928.98 → 2929.64] His home
[2929.64 → 2931.54] And they brought all the items
[2931.54 → 2932.46] Into her room
[2932.46 → 2933.42] They set it up for her
[2933.42 → 2934.24] As best they could
[2934.24 → 2935.02] And the last thing
[2935.02 → 2936.20] The son did for his mom
[2936.20 → 2937.54] Is he wrote a short note
[2937.54 → 2937.96] For her
[2937.96 → 2939.50] And he put it on the bedside table
[2939.50 → 2941.50] And it wasn't a long note
[2941.50 → 2941.98] It just said
[2941.98 → 2942.82] Mom it's me
[2942.82 → 2945.02] You're at this care home now
[2945.02 → 2947.24] You're under excellent care
[2947.24 → 2948.50] With the nurses that are here
[2948.50 → 2949.58] All your meals
[2949.58 → 2951.00] Will be provided for you
[2951.00 → 2952.36] Here's my number
[2952.36 → 2953.68] In case you need to call me
[2953.68 → 2954.88] I love you
[2954.88 → 2955.92] And I'll visit you soon
[2955.92 → 2958.76] Now he planned for that note
[2958.76 → 2959.48] Just to be sort of
[2959.48 → 2960.62] An initial way
[2960.62 → 2961.34] Of her mom
[2961.34 → 2962.78] His mom easing into the home
[2962.78 → 2963.82] But it quickly became
[2963.82 → 2964.48] That note
[2964.48 → 2966.18] Was the most important thing
[2966.18 → 2966.64] In the room
[2966.64 → 2968.14] She woke up early
[2968.14 → 2968.60] In the morning
[2968.60 → 2969.36] Many times
[2969.36 → 2969.90] And the first thing
[2969.90 → 2970.24] She would do
[2970.24 → 2970.94] Is grab that note
[2970.94 → 2971.80] To remind herself
[2971.80 → 2972.78] As she was disoriented
[2972.78 → 2973.62] Where she was
[2973.62 → 2974.56] What was going on
[2974.56 → 2975.94] Where her son was
[2975.94 → 2977.56] Often in the middle of the day
[2977.56 → 2978.80] She would get confused again
[2978.80 → 2979.84] And she'd grab that note
[2979.84 → 2980.78] And it would remind her again
[2980.78 → 2981.54] Okay I'm here
[2981.54 → 2982.66] My son lives down the road
[2982.66 → 2983.68] He's coming to visit me soon
[2983.68 → 2984.24] He loves me
[2984.24 → 2986.24] This note became so well-read
[2986.24 → 2987.00] That it was tattered
[2987.00 → 2988.18] And nearly illegible
[2988.18 → 2989.02] Within months
[2989.02 → 2991.72] Now I share this story
[2991.72 → 2992.40] Because I think
[2992.40 → 2993.96] With our walk with Christ
[2993.96 → 2995.02] We are a lot like
[2995.02 → 2995.90] That elderly mother
[2995.90 → 2996.96] With dementia
[2996.96 → 3000.08] We forget who we are
[3000.08 → 3002.18] We forget our story
[3002.18 → 3004.32] And so we need a note
[3004.32 → 3005.58] Like Ephesians
[3005.58 → 3006.82] To tell us again
[3006.82 → 3007.46] And again
[3007.46 → 3008.26] And again
[3008.26 → 3009.78] Who we are
[3009.78 → 3011.62] Our story
[3011.62 → 3013.62] How we've been rescued
[3013.62 → 3016.24] And that we are loved
[3016.24 → 3018.66] That's what Ephesians 2 is doing
[3018.66 → 3021.56] Now if you've travelled with us
[3021.56 → 3022.32] For the last six weeks
[3022.32 → 3023.12] You'll know that we've preached
[3023.12 → 3023.76] A sermon series
[3023.76 → 3024.82] On the first three verses
[3024.82 → 3026.16] Of Ephesians really
[3026.16 → 3027.78] And they're heavy verses
[3027.78 → 3029.00] I'll just be honest about that
[3029.00 → 3029.84] That was where Paul's saying
[3029.84 → 3031.20] Hey this is who you used to be
[3031.20 → 3032.64] Before Jesus came into your life
[3032.64 → 3033.74] This is what your life
[3033.74 → 3034.42] Used to be about
[3034.42 → 3035.84] Before you experienced salvation
[3035.84 → 3036.96] And Paul says
[3036.96 → 3038.18] You were dead in your sins
[3038.18 → 3039.16] And transgressions
[3039.16 → 3040.52] In which you used to live
[3040.52 → 3041.16] When you followed
[3041.16 → 3042.18] The ways of the world
[3042.18 → 3043.68] The ruler of the kingdom
[3043.68 → 3044.28] Of the air
[3044.28 → 3045.00] And the spirit
[3045.00 → 3046.10] That is now at work
[3046.10 → 3047.36] And those who are disobedient
[3047.36 → 3048.74] All of us
[3048.74 → 3049.86] Lived among them
[3049.86 → 3051.12] Gratifying the cravings
[3051.12 → 3052.00] Of the sinful flesh
[3052.00 → 3053.30] All of us
[3053.30 → 3054.20] Were by nature
[3054.20 → 3055.10] Deserving of wrath
[3055.10 → 3056.26] Those are heavy words
[3056.26 → 3058.76] And if you remember anything
[3058.76 → 3059.94] From the sermon series
[3059.94 → 3061.46] Remember that there are
[3061.46 → 3063.98] Three very powerful enemies
[3063.98 → 3065.82] That bring about destruction
[3065.82 → 3067.52] And demise in all of our lives
[3067.52 → 3068.64] And they are
[3068.64 → 3069.10] Number one
[3069.10 → 3070.06] The power of the flesh
[3070.06 → 3070.86] We talked about this
[3070.86 → 3071.74] In our sermon series
[3071.74 → 3072.90] Number two
[3072.90 → 3073.64] The power of the
[3073.64 → 3074.68] Idolatrous structures
[3074.68 → 3075.30] In our world
[3075.30 → 3076.72] Just the normal way of society
[3076.72 → 3077.84] And number three
[3077.84 → 3079.10] Satan himself
[3079.10 → 3080.80] And if you're someone
[3080.80 → 3081.84] Who's not part of the
[3081.84 → 3082.46] Christian faith
[3082.46 → 3084.22] This is the biblical answer
[3084.22 → 3084.98] To the question
[3084.98 → 3086.22] Why is it so hard
[3086.22 → 3087.22] To flourish in life?
[3087.66 → 3088.60] Like why is it so hard
[3088.60 → 3089.76] To get along with joy
[3089.76 → 3090.74] And have good
[3090.74 → 3091.70] And healthy relationships
[3091.70 → 3092.72] And find meaning
[3092.72 → 3093.32] And purpose?
[3093.58 → 3094.28] Well the reason is
[3094.28 → 3095.86] They're very powerful enemies
[3095.86 → 3097.64] That seek to destroy you
[3097.64 → 3098.30] Enemies within
[3098.30 → 3099.36] And enemies around
[3099.36 → 3102.44] And Paul says
[3102.44 → 3103.42] In no uncertain terms
[3103.42 → 3104.68] You do not have the strength
[3104.68 → 3105.58] To fight these enemies
[3105.58 → 3107.10] You are not clever
[3107.10 → 3107.98] Or smart
[3107.98 → 3109.22] Or strong enough
[3109.22 → 3110.38] To resist the temptation
[3110.38 → 3111.58] That comes with them
[3111.58 → 3112.48] These are enemies
[3112.48 → 3113.68] That are too great for us
[3113.68 → 3114.56] We need something greater
[3114.56 → 3115.32] Than ourselves
[3115.32 → 3117.72] And that then brings us
[3117.72 → 3118.94] To the rest of our passage
[3118.94 → 3121.16] The rest of this passage
[3121.16 → 3122.90] Is just straight up good news
[3122.90 → 3124.54] And it all hinges on verse four
[3124.54 → 3125.24] Which is sort of
[3125.24 → 3126.48] The big switch
[3126.48 → 3127.64] In Ephesians two
[3127.64 → 3128.58] And I'll read it for us
[3128.58 → 3129.50] Where Paul writes
[3129.50 → 3131.62] But because
[3131.62 → 3134.50] Because of his great love for us
[3134.50 → 3136.66] God who is rich in mercy
[3136.66 → 3138.66] Made us alive in Christ
[3138.66 → 3140.88] Even when we were dead
[3140.88 → 3142.04] In our transgressions
[3142.04 → 3143.64] It is by grace
[3143.64 → 3145.08] You have been saved
[3145.08 → 3149.70] A.W. Tower
[3149.70 → 3151.22] We quoted him earlier
[3151.22 → 3151.82] In this series
[3151.82 → 3153.32] I'll give you another quote
[3153.32 → 3154.14] From A.W. Tower
[3154.14 → 3154.94] That I quite like
[3154.94 → 3155.82] It kind of worms
[3155.82 → 3156.86] It's way into your imagination
[3156.86 → 3157.54] He says
[3157.54 → 3159.30] What we think about
[3159.30 → 3161.60] When we think about God
[3161.60 → 3163.40] Is the most important thing
[3163.40 → 3163.96] About us
[3163.96 → 3165.50] I'll say it again
[3165.50 → 3166.50] What comes to mind
[3166.50 → 3168.14] When we think about God
[3168.14 → 3169.54] Is the most important thing
[3169.54 → 3170.16] About us
[3170.16 → 3171.82] And so let me just ask you
[3171.82 → 3173.74] What comes to your mind
[3173.74 → 3175.54] When you think about God
[3175.54 → 3179.16] What parts of his character
[3179.16 → 3181.80] What first associations
[3181.80 → 3183.62] What assumptions
[3183.62 → 3187.04] The first thing that Paul says
[3187.04 → 3187.84] In Ephesians two
[3187.84 → 3189.36] As he's talking about God
[3189.36 → 3193.46] Is that he is great in his love
[3193.46 → 3195.24] And not just in a vague general sense
[3195.24 → 3196.64] But a directed sense
[3196.64 → 3197.90] That is for us
[3197.90 → 3199.52] It's a love that's for humanity
[3199.52 → 3201.40] Second thing Paul says
[3201.40 → 3203.28] Is that God is rich
[3203.28 → 3204.24] Or abundant
[3204.24 → 3206.68] Or overflowing in mercy
[3206.68 → 3208.56] And then of course
[3208.56 → 3211.36] God is full of grace
[3211.36 → 3213.60] Is that how you imagine God?
[3214.70 → 3216.08] That's what compels
[3216.08 → 3217.24] All of God's activity
[3217.24 → 3218.54] Throughout the entire story
[3218.54 → 3219.12] Of the Bible
[3219.12 → 3219.80] To rescue
[3219.80 → 3220.92] Redeem
[3220.92 → 3221.76] And heal
[3221.76 → 3224.66] Now Paul and other biblical writers
[3224.66 → 3225.22] Never Do
[3225.22 → 3226.26] They never speak of God
[3226.26 → 3227.70] In vague abstract senses
[3227.70 → 3228.88] They never speak of his love
[3228.88 → 3230.72] In vague abstract ways
[3230.72 → 3233.30] Paul knows that God's love
[3233.30 → 3234.70] Lived and breathed
[3234.70 → 3238.12] God's love spoke and acted
[3238.12 → 3242.04] God's love was perfectly embodied
[3242.04 → 3243.28] In the person of Jesus
[3243.28 → 3244.80] Do you know this?
[3245.60 → 3247.34] That as Jesus lived and breathed
[3247.34 → 3247.72] In the world
[3247.72 → 3248.62] He actually said to people
[3248.62 → 3249.52] If you've seen me
[3249.52 → 3251.20] You've seen the Father
[3251.20 → 3253.24] If you've been in conversation with me
[3253.24 → 3255.06] You're hearing the love of the Father
[3255.06 → 3256.46] And Jesus over and over
[3256.46 → 3257.52] And over throughout his whole
[3257.52 → 3258.28] Earthly ministry
[3258.28 → 3260.74] Demonstrated the heart of God
[3260.74 → 3262.18] As he healed the sick
[3262.18 → 3263.80] As he cast out demons
[3263.80 → 3265.32] As he calmed the storm
[3265.32 → 3266.74] As he dined with the outcasts
[3266.74 → 3268.68] As he forgave the sinners
[3268.68 → 3271.66] Jesus shows the love of God
[3271.66 → 3272.40] Concrete
[3272.40 → 3273.34] Tangible
[3273.34 → 3274.12] Visible
[3274.12 → 3276.30] But nowhere does Jesus
[3276.30 → 3277.20] Show the love of God
[3277.20 → 3278.00] More palpably
[3278.00 → 3279.14] And climactically
[3279.14 → 3279.86] Than he does
[3279.86 → 3281.14] In and through the cross
[3281.14 → 3282.74] If you're here
[3282.74 → 3284.20] With us on Good Friday
[3284.20 → 3285.12] Where we celebrated
[3285.12 → 3286.00] Or celebrated
[3286.00 → 3287.32] We remember the death of Jesus
[3287.32 → 3288.54] At PCC
[3288.54 → 3289.30] Pastor Prince
[3289.30 → 3290.30] At that church
[3290.30 → 3291.00] Preached on the way
[3291.00 → 3291.86] In which Jesus
[3291.86 → 3293.04] Demonstrates the love of God
[3293.04 → 3294.44] By laying down his life
[3294.44 → 3296.26] It's an act of self
[3296.26 → 3297.04] Giving
[3297.04 → 3297.94] Love
[3297.94 → 3300.34] And for the rest of this morning
[3300.34 → 3301.58] I'm going to focus our attention
[3301.58 → 3302.36] On the way in which
[3302.36 → 3303.94] The resurrection of Jesus
[3303.94 → 3306.20] Is a demonstration of God's love
[3306.20 → 3306.68] As well
[3306.68 → 3309.12] Now
[3309.12 → 3310.34] One of the things
[3310.34 → 3311.20] That's very powerful
[3311.20 → 3311.96] About this passage
[3311.96 → 3313.46] Is the way that
[3313.46 → 3315.54] Paul talks about the resurrection
[3315.54 → 3316.54] I mean he doesn't say it
[3316.54 → 3317.12] As you might think
[3317.12 → 3317.62] He doesn't just say
[3317.62 → 3318.00] Hey guys
[3318.00 → 3319.42] Jesus rose from the dead
[3319.42 → 3320.92] He wants to say
[3320.92 → 3322.48] This is what Jesus' resurrection
[3322.48 → 3323.06] From the dead
[3323.06 → 3324.08] Means for you
[3324.08 → 3325.40] Okay
[3325.40 → 3326.08] He wants to say
[3326.08 → 3327.06] Now that we know
[3327.06 → 3327.92] Jesus rose from the dead
[3327.92 → 3328.56] Let me tell you
[3328.56 → 3329.42] The implications
[3329.42 → 3330.90] For those who believe
[3330.90 → 3331.98] In Jesus by faith
[3331.98 → 3333.86] And here's where we get into
[3333.86 → 3335.36] What scholars will describe
[3335.36 → 3335.88] This passage
[3335.88 → 3336.84] As one that is about
[3336.84 → 3338.10] Our union with Christ
[3338.10 → 3339.72] The way we are connected
[3339.72 → 3340.14] To Jesus
[3340.14 → 3341.34] When we come to faith in Jesus
[3341.34 → 3342.20] When we're baptized
[3342.20 → 3342.90] Into the church
[3342.90 → 3344.64] We experience union with Christ
[3344.64 → 3346.20] And very practically
[3346.20 → 3348.10] People have talked about that
[3348.10 → 3348.96] From this stage already
[3348.96 → 3350.90] We baptized two adults
[3350.90 → 3351.68] In the last few months
[3351.68 → 3352.98] We baptized Caden and Jibe
[3352.98 → 3353.90] I don't know where you are Jibe
[3353.90 → 3354.94] But I saw Caden earlier
[3354.94 → 3355.88] Where you are
[3355.88 → 3356.88] Right there
[3356.88 → 3357.90] This is your first Easter
[3357.90 → 3359.34] It's great to have you here
[3359.34 → 3360.82] And I remember
[3360.82 → 3362.16] As you shared your testimonies
[3362.16 → 3363.44] You talked about how
[3363.44 → 3364.66] When you encounter Jesus
[3364.66 → 3365.82] There's something about
[3365.82 → 3367.06] The life of Jesus
[3367.06 → 3368.00] The power of Jesus
[3368.00 → 3369.20] That begins to take hold
[3369.20 → 3369.66] Of your life
[3369.66 → 3370.70] Begins to change your life
[3370.70 → 3371.32] And Jibe
[3371.32 → 3371.82] Same thing
[3371.82 → 3372.34] There's something about
[3372.34 → 3373.20] Coming to faith in Jesus
[3373.20 → 3374.48] There's this new power
[3374.48 → 3375.38] You're connected to
[3375.38 → 3377.04] Because you have union with Christ
[3377.04 → 3378.38] There's this new life
[3378.38 → 3379.70] That is connected to you
[3379.70 → 3380.78] Through faith
[3380.78 → 3383.20] And so what's true for Jesus
[3383.20 → 3384.98] Then becomes true for believers
[3384.98 → 3386.90] What happens to Jesus
[3386.90 → 3387.82] The implications then
[3387.82 → 3388.72] Go over to believers
[3388.72 → 3389.90] Or as one writer puts it
[3389.90 → 3391.28] There's nothing that God
[3391.28 → 3391.84] Gives Jesus
[3391.84 → 3393.62] That he does not also share
[3393.62 → 3394.36] With Jesus' children
[3394.36 → 3395.82] The rest of the church
[3395.82 → 3396.92] And I'll show you now
[3396.92 → 3398.36] How Paul writes this
[3398.36 → 3399.78] In verse 5 and 6
[3399.78 → 3400.46] If you've got your Bible
[3400.46 → 3401.44] Or you can look at the screen
[3401.44 → 3404.22] This is what Paul says
[3404.22 → 3406.04] Ephesians 2
[3406.04 → 3409.32] But because of his great love for us
[3409.32 → 3410.68] God who is rich in mercy
[3410.68 → 3414.92] Made us alive with Christ
[3414.92 → 3415.74] Even when we were dead
[3415.74 → 3416.72] In our transgressions
[3416.72 → 3417.34] Verse 6
[3417.34 → 3420.18] And God raised us up with Christ
[3420.18 → 3422.20] And seated us with him
[3422.20 → 3423.48] In the heavenly realms
[3423.48 → 3424.42] In Christ Jesus
[3424.42 → 3425.50] Do you see the language there?
[3426.06 → 3427.40] All the ways that Paul's talking
[3427.40 → 3428.42] About the resurrection of Jesus
[3428.42 → 3430.12] He's saying it happened to us
[3430.12 → 3432.26] So let me just like clear this
[3432.26 → 3433.58] Make this as clear as I can
[3433.58 → 3435.10] When Jesus died
[3435.10 → 3436.22] We died with him
[3436.22 → 3439.32] When Jesus broke out of the grave
[3439.32 → 3440.22] In resurrection life
[3440.22 → 3441.96] Paul says we rose with him
[3441.96 → 3443.86] And even he goes so far as to say
[3443.86 → 3446.38] When Jesus ascended to be with the Father
[3446.38 → 3448.60] We ascended with him
[3448.60 → 3450.94] You know so often we talk about the way
[3450.94 → 3452.06] In which the death of Jesus
[3452.06 → 3453.70] Is what marks our lives
[3453.70 → 3454.32] And we sort of
[3454.32 → 3455.50] He dies in our place
[3455.50 → 3456.28] And he dies for us
[3456.28 → 3457.56] But the same is true of his resurrection
[3457.56 → 3459.40] We share in that life
[3459.40 → 3461.30] And Paul can't wait to tell the church
[3461.30 → 3463.10] This is what it means for you now
[3463.10 → 3465.36] And this is what it means for you in eternity
[3465.36 → 3468.34] Now one of the beautiful things
[3468.34 → 3469.00] About this passage
[3469.00 → 3469.98] Is Paul jumps between
[3469.98 → 3470.76] The present tense
[3470.76 → 3471.60] The past tense
[3471.60 → 3472.32] And the future tense
[3472.32 → 3474.16] In fact some of the most confusing parts
[3474.16 → 3475.24] Of this passage grammatically
[3475.24 → 3476.84] Are some of those beautiful parts
[3476.84 → 3478.72] Of what Paul's trying to teach the church
[3478.72 → 3479.70] Let me explain
[3479.70 → 3481.62] Paul wants people to know
[3481.62 → 3482.96] That the resurrection of Jesus
[3482.96 → 3485.32] Changes everything about the future
[3485.32 → 3486.86] For those who have faith in Jesus
[3486.86 → 3489.18] He also wants the believers to know
[3489.18 → 3490.78] That his resurrection changes everything
[3490.78 → 3491.62] But they're present
[3491.62 → 3493.28] So you'll notice
[3493.28 → 3494.16] I'll just read for us
[3494.16 → 3495.00] Verse 7 again
[3495.00 → 3496.60] Smack dab in this passage
[3496.60 → 3497.10] Where Paul's saying
[3497.10 → 3498.42] This is what happened to you through Jesus
[3498.42 → 3499.68] These are the events that happened
[3499.68 → 3500.78] He said in verse 7
[3500.78 → 3504.16] And God raised us up with Christ
[3504.16 → 3505.44] Seated us with him
[3505.44 → 3506.26] In the heavenly realms
[3506.26 → 3507.04] In Christ Jesus
[3507.04 → 3507.98] Look at this
[3507.98 → 3509.36] In order that
[3509.36 → 3510.90] In the coming ages
[3510.90 → 3512.32] He might show us
[3512.32 → 3514.44] The incomparable riches
[3514.44 → 3516.28] Of his grace
[3516.28 → 3517.86] Expressed to us
[3517.86 → 3519.24] In Christ Jesus
[3519.24 → 3520.80] Now do you know
[3520.80 → 3521.80] What Paul's trying to say there?
[3523.02 → 3524.60] The simple way of putting this
[3524.60 → 3525.38] Is Paul's saying
[3525.38 → 3527.06] That Jesus who rose from the dead
[3527.06 → 3527.80] Who's now seated
[3527.80 → 3529.22] At the right hand of God the Father
[3529.22 → 3530.70] Is coming back
[3530.70 → 3531.40] In glory
[3531.40 → 3532.06] In judgment
[3532.06 → 3532.76] In power
[3532.76 → 3534.32] And he's going to eradicate
[3534.32 → 3535.24] Evil from our world
[3535.24 → 3536.18] He's going to eradicate
[3536.18 → 3537.10] Sin from our world
[3537.10 → 3538.14] He's going to eradicate
[3538.14 → 3539.42] Demonic and satanic
[3539.42 → 3540.42] Activity from the world
[3540.42 → 3542.08] So that we can enjoy
[3542.08 → 3543.22] This creation
[3543.22 → 3544.06] The way we were created
[3544.06 → 3544.78] From the beginning
[3544.78 → 3545.94] Forever
[3545.94 → 3548.36] The hope of the New Testament
[3548.36 → 3548.98] I want to say this
[3548.98 → 3549.70] As clear as I can
[3549.70 → 3551.52] Is the resurrection of the body
[3551.52 → 3553.58] To enjoy a resurrected world
[3553.58 → 3554.38] Forever
[3554.38 → 3556.40] It's not a disembodied spirit
[3556.40 → 3557.40] Somewhere up in the clouds
[3557.40 → 3557.84] In a harp
[3557.84 → 3559.34] It's us getting new bodies
[3559.34 → 3560.68] That's one of the deep convictions
[3560.68 → 3561.38] Of the New Testament
[3561.38 → 3563.68] New bodies that do not perish
[3563.68 → 3565.34] That do not get diseases
[3565.34 → 3567.34] That get to enjoy this world
[3567.34 → 3568.14] Forever
[3568.14 → 3570.08] In the presence of our living God
[3570.08 → 3570.74] That's the hope
[3570.74 → 3571.48] Of the whole scriptures
[3571.48 → 3573.50] Sometimes it's helpful
[3573.50 → 3574.52] To illustrate the points
[3574.52 → 3575.86] If you've been at Hope for a while
[3575.86 → 3576.78] You know that I'm terrible
[3576.78 → 3577.50] With my illustrations
[3577.50 → 3579.38] But today I have an illustration
[3579.38 → 3580.00] You're welcome
[3580.00 → 3580.56] You have to wait
[3580.56 → 3581.20] Till next Easter
[3581.20 → 3581.90] For my next one
[3581.90 → 3584.14] So I have here
[3584.14 → 3585.08] This fancy rope
[3585.08 → 3586.10] Some of you might know
[3586.10 → 3586.72] This illustration
[3586.72 → 3589.12] And can you see
[3589.12 → 3589.82] On this rope
[3589.82 → 3590.40] There's this like
[3590.40 → 3590.90] Reddish
[3590.90 → 3592.52] Maroon coloured tape
[3592.52 → 3594.26] That represents
[3594.26 → 3595.32] That represents your entire life
[3595.32 → 3596.38] Okay
[3596.38 → 3597.92] This is your birth
[3597.92 → 3599.68] This is like the trajectory
[3599.68 → 3600.20] Of your life
[3600.20 → 3600.86] And this is
[3600.86 → 3602.08] We do not know when this is
[3602.08 → 3602.84] But this is your death
[3602.84 → 3603.74] This is your whole life
[3603.74 → 3604.52] All the milestones
[3604.52 → 3605.14] All the grief
[3605.14 → 3605.66] All the joy
[3605.66 → 3606.28] All the sorrows
[3606.28 → 3607.92] You're 80 to 100 years
[3607.92 → 3608.52] Lord willing
[3608.52 → 3609.84] Although some people say
[3609.84 → 3610.70] They don't want 100 years
[3610.70 → 3611.10] Who knows
[3611.10 → 3612.54] The whole of your life
[3612.54 → 3613.72] Is represented in this tape
[3613.72 → 3614.12] Right here
[3614.12 → 3617.14] And what Paul is saying
[3617.14 → 3618.80] Is that the inexpressible riches
[3618.80 → 3619.68] Of God's grace
[3619.68 → 3621.64] Is that after you die
[3621.64 → 3624.26] By the power of Jesus Christ
[3624.26 → 3625.42] When he returns
[3625.42 → 3626.50] We rise to life
[3626.50 → 3627.60] Forever
[3627.60 → 3629.44] And this represents
[3629.44 → 3630.94] Our life in eternity
[3630.94 → 3632.50] In a new creation
[3632.50 → 3634.14] With a new body
[3634.14 → 3636.02] With new friendships
[3636.02 → 3637.88] That aren't tainted by sin
[3637.88 → 3639.76] The ability to enjoy music
[3639.76 → 3641.44] Dancing
[3641.44 → 3643.14] Friendship
[3643.14 → 3643.98] Good food
[3643.98 → 3645.58] Sunsets
[3645.58 → 3646.90] Sunrises
[3646.90 → 3647.90] Hikes
[3647.90 → 3648.88] Camping
[3648.88 → 3650.38] All the stuff you love
[3650.38 → 3651.70] About this world
[3651.70 → 3652.80] And our life in it
[3652.80 → 3654.34] We get to enjoy
[3654.34 → 3655.80] Forever in the new creation
[3655.80 → 3657.72] With resurrected bodies
[3657.72 → 3659.14] Eternally
[3659.14 → 3660.68] You're getting my point
[3660.68 → 3663.54] The inexpressible riches
[3663.54 → 3664.64] Of God's grace
[3664.64 → 3666.06] Expected to us in Jesus Christ
[3666.06 → 3667.70] Is that what's true for Jesus
[3667.70 → 3668.94] Resurrection from the dead
[3668.94 → 3670.46] Is true for the church
[3670.46 → 3672.24] Resurrection from the dead
[3672.24 → 3673.78] There will come a day
[3673.78 → 3675.00] Where the bodies
[3675.00 → 3675.78] That we live in
[3675.78 → 3677.28] Although they go to the grave
[3677.28 → 3678.70] Will rise victorious
[3678.70 → 3680.28] Not because of what we've done
[3680.28 → 3681.64] But because Jesus
[3681.64 → 3683.46] Showed us how to do it
[3683.46 → 3684.62] And the same power
[3684.62 → 3685.64] That rose Jesus Christ
[3685.64 → 3686.12] From the dead
[3686.12 → 3687.60] Is at work in the church also
[3687.60 → 3689.88] If you go
[3689.88 → 3690.82] To Europe
[3690.82 → 3691.74] And you travel around
[3691.74 → 3693.12] And you find yourself
[3693.12 → 3693.72] In a cemetery
[3693.72 → 3694.82] Although it sounds really dark
[3694.82 → 3695.52] And creepy now
[3695.52 → 3697.14] You will know
[3697.14 → 3697.76] That there are a number
[3697.76 → 3698.48] Of tombstones
[3698.48 → 3699.54] Where their epitaph
[3699.54 → 3700.08] Is written
[3700.08 → 3700.90] Resurged
[3700.90 → 3701.62] It's a Latin word
[3701.62 → 3702.26] You know what it means
[3702.26 → 3704.60] I shall rise
[3704.60 → 3706.58] And I think it's so beautiful
[3706.58 → 3707.72] And defiant
[3707.72 → 3708.32] For believers
[3708.32 → 3709.18] Throughout the generations
[3709.18 → 3709.62] To say
[3709.62 → 3710.52] When I die
[3710.52 → 3712.00] And I'm dug into the ground
[3712.00 → 3712.84] And put in a box
[3712.84 → 3713.50] Six feet under
[3713.50 → 3714.70] The only word
[3714.70 → 3715.96] I want on my epitaph
[3715.96 → 3718.42] Is I shall rise
[3718.42 → 3718.98] Why?
[3719.12 → 3720.26] Because Jesus Christ
[3720.26 → 3721.46] Rose from the dead
[3721.46 → 3722.72] And Jesus' power
[3722.72 → 3723.66] Is at work in the church
[3723.66 → 3724.56] And by faith
[3724.56 → 3725.72] That power is mine
[3725.72 → 3726.98] And we will live forever
[3726.98 → 3727.70] In a new creation
[3727.70 → 3728.34] Because of him
[3728.34 → 3730.80] That's the inexpressible riches
[3730.80 → 3732.90] That God has shown us
[3732.90 → 3734.08] In and through Jesus Christ
[3734.08 → 3735.20] Praise the Lord church
[3735.20 → 3736.52] Praise the Lord
[3736.52 → 3737.74] That death is not the end
[3737.74 → 3739.00] Praise the Lord
[3739.00 → 3739.60] That disease
[3739.60 → 3741.12] And bodies that break down
[3741.12 → 3741.78] Is not the end
[3741.78 → 3742.94] But the end for the believer
[3742.94 → 3744.82] Is resurrection life
[3744.82 → 3746.32] This is what gets Paul
[3746.32 → 3746.94] So excited
[3746.94 → 3748.12] But it gets better
[3748.12 → 3749.04] Than this hope
[3749.04 → 3750.58] What Paul wants to say
[3750.58 → 3751.50] Is it's not just
[3751.50 → 3752.24] That we have to wait
[3752.24 → 3753.22] For the end of our life
[3753.22 → 3754.04] To go to the grave
[3754.04 → 3755.10] For Jesus to return
[3755.10 → 3755.58] For us to have
[3755.58 → 3756.60] New resurrected bodies
[3756.60 → 3758.26] That resurrection life
[3758.26 → 3760.14] Breaks into the present now
[3760.14 → 3761.94] To grab the rope again
[3761.94 → 3764.48] When Jesus rose from the dead
[3764.48 → 3765.96] He brought the end of history
[3765.96 → 3766.74] Into the present
[3766.74 → 3768.02] Does that make sense?
[3768.76 → 3769.98] It's very hard to comprehend
[3769.98 → 3770.74] But that's what happened
[3770.74 → 3772.30] The life that rose Jesus
[3772.30 → 3773.38] From the grave
[3773.38 → 3774.64] Stayed
[3774.64 → 3775.76] As we receive the power
[3775.76 → 3776.62] And that life now
[3776.62 → 3777.96] Comes into our small
[3777.96 → 3778.92] Short lives
[3778.92 → 3779.92] Here on earth
[3779.92 → 3782.06] We get to experience
[3782.06 → 3782.74] The renewal
[3782.74 → 3784.56] And the transformation
[3784.56 → 3786.10] Of the power
[3786.10 → 3787.18] Of the resurrection now
[3787.18 → 3789.10] And just to go back
[3789.10 → 3790.02] To your testimony
[3790.02 → 3791.32] Caden and Jibe
[3791.32 → 3792.88] You knew exactly
[3792.88 → 3794.18] What we're talking about now
[3794.18 → 3794.64] When you said
[3794.64 → 3795.88] There's something transformative
[3795.88 → 3797.68] About coming to faith in Jesus
[3797.68 → 3798.38] There's something about
[3798.38 → 3799.56] The person you are
[3799.56 → 3800.58] Begins to change
[3800.58 → 3802.22] The desires you have
[3802.22 → 3802.96] Begin to change
[3802.96 → 3804.22] The ambitions you have
[3804.22 → 3804.74] For your life
[3804.74 → 3805.34] Begin to change
[3805.34 → 3806.42] Because Jesus Christ
[3806.42 → 3807.78] Through the power of the Spirit
[3807.78 → 3809.26] Is making you more
[3809.26 → 3810.54] And more like himself
[3810.54 → 3812.38] The resurrection life
[3812.38 → 3814.24] Has broken into the present
[3814.24 → 3816.96] And I think one of my
[3816.96 → 3817.60] Favourite things about
[3817.60 → 3818.32] Being a pastor
[3818.32 → 3818.96] By the way
[3818.96 → 3820.84] Is getting a front row seat
[3820.84 → 3821.98] To see it at work
[3821.98 → 3822.74] In our church
[3822.74 → 3824.92] I don't think of the resurrection
[3824.92 → 3826.48] As some vague term
[3826.48 → 3827.86] As something just off
[3827.86 → 3828.44] In the distance
[3828.44 → 3829.54] I get to witness
[3829.54 → 3830.76] And celebrate the power
[3830.76 → 3831.32] Of the resurrection
[3831.32 → 3832.96] Here at Hope Community Church
[3832.96 → 3834.24] Here in this city
[3834.24 → 3836.36] Here in this specific community
[3836.36 → 3838.20] Let me give you
[3838.20 → 3839.44] Just a few examples
[3839.44 → 3843.68] I see the resurrection power
[3843.68 → 3845.30] When I spend some time
[3845.30 → 3846.66] With seniors in our community
[3846.66 → 3848.66] You often know in the scriptures
[3848.66 → 3849.56] We talk about people
[3849.56 → 3850.88] Who follow Jesus for a long time
[3850.88 → 3851.70] As the saints
[3851.70 → 3853.68] And I really do believe
[3853.68 → 3854.42] That in our midst
[3854.42 → 3855.46] We have saints
[3855.46 → 3856.94] People who follow Jesus
[3856.94 → 3857.56] For so long
[3857.56 → 3858.44] That when you look at them
[3858.44 → 3859.46] You see their generosity
[3859.46 → 3860.66] You see their selflessness
[3860.66 → 3862.24] You see their care for the other
[3862.24 → 3863.46] Their humility
[3863.46 → 3865.10] And ability to just love others
[3865.10 → 3865.66] You say man
[3865.66 → 3867.68] The person and the power of Jesus
[3867.68 → 3868.96] Is so at work in you
[3868.96 → 3870.04] You demonstrate
[3870.04 → 3872.42] The way life is supposed to be lived
[3872.42 → 3873.46] I see it in you
[3873.46 → 3876.34] I see the power of the resurrection
[3876.34 → 3878.14] When small groups get together
[3878.14 → 3878.98] And they share a meal
[3878.98 → 3880.12] And after they share a meal
[3880.12 → 3881.26] They sit down with the word
[3881.26 → 3882.40] And they want God to speak
[3882.40 → 3884.40] And the real secret sauce
[3884.40 → 3885.30] Happens in small groups
[3885.30 → 3885.88] When someone says
[3885.88 → 3886.86] Hey can you pray for me
[3886.86 → 3888.32] I've been diagnosed
[3888.32 → 3889.52] With some pretty terrible stuff
[3889.52 → 3891.36] Or I'm in major conflict
[3891.36 → 3892.56] With my spouse or my child
[3892.56 → 3893.24] Can you pray for me
[3893.24 → 3893.98] And seeing believers
[3893.98 → 3895.00] Come around each other
[3895.00 → 3896.30] And start to ask God
[3896.30 → 3897.24] To do something new
[3897.24 → 3898.62] To bring life into places
[3898.62 → 3899.38] Where there is death
[3899.38 → 3900.00] And decay
[3900.00 → 3901.24] We see the beauty
[3901.24 → 3902.58] Of the resurrection show up
[3902.58 → 3905.42] I see the resurrection of Jesus
[3905.42 → 3907.00] Taking place
[3907.00 → 3908.64] When an ordinary crew of people
[3908.64 → 3909.52] On Wednesday nights
[3909.52 → 3910.18] From our church
[3910.18 → 3911.28] Shows up at the Coverdale
[3911.28 → 3911.98] Community Kitchen
[3911.98 → 3913.06] To make a meal
[3913.06 → 3914.14] And then share that meal
[3914.14 → 3915.14] With some of the most vulnerable
[3915.14 → 3916.90] Hurting people in our city
[3916.90 → 3918.68] The resurrection of Jesus
[3918.68 → 3919.48] Is at work
[3919.48 → 3921.70] I see the resurrection of Jesus
[3921.70 → 3922.18] At work
[3922.18 → 3923.42] When another group of people
[3923.42 → 3923.92] In our church
[3923.92 → 3924.58] Sits down
[3924.58 → 3925.48] On a regular basis
[3925.48 → 3927.50] To do incredibly painstaking
[3927.50 → 3929.06] Tedious paperwork
[3929.06 → 3931.30] And then do all these fundraisers
[3931.30 → 3932.62] To bring in a family
[3932.62 → 3933.80] That had to flee war
[3933.80 → 3934.88] In the Middle East
[3934.88 → 3936.04] Who lost their homes
[3936.04 → 3937.34] So they can resettle
[3937.34 → 3938.16] In our country
[3938.16 → 3939.22] In safety
[3939.22 → 3940.26] And start afresh
[3940.26 → 3943.36] I see the resurrection
[3943.36 → 3944.60] Of Jesus Christ at work
[3944.60 → 3946.14] When couples get together
[3946.14 → 3947.18] And they ask for forgiveness
[3947.18 → 3949.38] And parents sit down
[3949.38 → 3950.04] With their kids
[3950.04 → 3951.98] And ask for forgiveness
[3951.98 → 3952.98] For whatever has gone on
[3952.98 → 3953.72] Wrong in their home
[3953.72 → 3956.18] All of these and more
[3956.18 → 3958.18] Are small glimpses
[3958.18 → 3960.16] Of the life that's coming
[3960.16 → 3962.46] Small foretastes
[3962.46 → 3963.78] Or sneak previews
[3963.78 → 3964.66] Of the way lives
[3964.66 → 3965.68] Are supposed to be lived
[3965.68 → 3966.56] From the beginning
[3966.56 → 3968.22] And the way they will be lived
[3968.22 → 3970.20] When Jesus returns in glory
[3970.20 → 3971.88] And when you show
[3971.88 → 3973.40] The self-lowering love of Jesus
[3973.40 → 3974.52] When you show
[3974.52 → 3976.38] The selfless generosity of Jesus
[3976.38 → 3977.20] When you show
[3977.20 → 3978.54] The selfless concern
[3978.54 → 3979.38] Towards the other
[3979.38 → 3980.38] You're giving people
[3980.38 → 3981.70] A small taste
[3981.70 → 3982.70] Through your work
[3982.70 → 3983.64] And your friendship at school
[3983.64 → 3984.84] A small taste of the way
[3984.84 → 3986.10] It's all going to be
[3986.10 → 3989.32] Another way to put it is
[3989.32 → 3991.44] When you truly love your neighbour
[3991.44 → 3994.40] And you want to serve your neighbour
[3994.40 → 3996.74] You're giving people a glimpse
[3996.74 → 3998.96] Of what eternity will be normally
[3998.96 → 4002.94] And can I just say church
[4002.94 → 4005.40] Praise the Lord
[4005.40 → 4007.20] That the resurrection life
[4007.20 → 4008.42] Is not just some vague thing
[4008.42 → 4009.38] We wait for in the future
[4009.38 → 4010.98] The resurrection life of Jesus
[4010.98 → 4012.16] Is ours
[4012.16 → 4015.24] And Paul wants to underscore this point
[4015.24 → 4015.88] He says it twice
[4015.88 → 4018.22] We did nothing to get it
[4018.22 → 4018.52] Right?
[4019.08 → 4020.92] It's by grace through faith
[4020.92 → 4022.04] Not by work
[4022.04 → 4023.38] So that no one can boast
[4023.38 → 4024.20] Paul says
[4024.20 → 4025.26] There's no room for boasting
[4025.26 → 4025.84] In the church
[4025.84 → 4026.98] No room for showing
[4026.98 → 4027.94] How much you're better than someone
[4027.94 → 4028.90] No room for elevating
[4028.90 → 4029.52] Your ability
[4029.52 → 4030.62] Your spiritual gifts
[4030.62 → 4031.48] Your anything
[4031.48 → 4032.98] Over anyone else in the church
[4032.98 → 4033.20] He says
[4033.20 → 4033.94] Everyone who comes
[4033.94 → 4034.92] Into the body of Christ
[4034.92 → 4036.40] Enters through the doors
[4036.40 → 4037.58] Of grace
[4037.58 → 4040.56] The gospel is the great equalizer
[4040.56 → 4042.72] Jesus reaches into all the mud
[4042.72 → 4043.50] All the muck
[4043.50 → 4044.40] All the brokenness
[4044.40 → 4044.88] And rebellion
[4044.88 → 4046.00] Of all of our lives
[4046.00 → 4048.04] And pulls us by his love
[4048.04 → 4049.68] Into the church
[4049.68 → 4051.18] And gives us the life
[4051.18 → 4051.82] Of the resurrection
[4051.82 → 4053.90] We're here through the doors
[4053.90 → 4054.48] Of grace
[4054.48 → 4056.38] And so we praise the Lord
[4056.38 → 4058.32] That he saw fit
[4058.32 → 4059.82] In his kindness
[4059.82 → 4060.84] And his mercy
[4060.84 → 4062.78] To include us
[4062.78 → 4063.72] In Christ
[4063.72 → 4065.12] And to fill us
[4065.12 → 4066.42] With his power
[4066.42 → 4069.02] The one thing
[4069.02 → 4069.94] That is required
[4069.94 → 4072.22] For this resurrection life
[4072.22 → 4073.14] Paul makes very clear
[4073.14 → 4073.68] Doesn't he?
[4074.18 → 4074.56] He says
[4074.56 → 4076.14] By grace you have been saved
[4076.14 → 4077.14] Through
[4077.14 → 4079.26] Faith
[4079.26 → 4081.74] What we are commanded to do
[4081.74 → 4083.12] What we are invited to do
[4083.12 → 4085.12] Is to receive the gift
[4085.12 → 4086.98] To take hold of Jesus
[4086.98 → 4087.84] And I think the best way
[4087.84 → 4088.66] To translate faith
[4088.66 → 4089.66] In contemporary language
[4089.66 → 4090.72] Is actually trust
[4090.72 → 4092.80] You give Jesus your trust
[4092.80 → 4094.56] His way for life
[4094.56 → 4095.60] Becomes your way for life
[4095.60 → 4096.92] His will becomes your will
[4096.92 → 4098.28] You follow in the pattern
[4098.28 → 4100.00] That Jesus leaves for us
[4100.00 → 4101.16] In his life and ministry
[4101.16 → 4101.50] And you say
[4101.50 → 4102.64] That's the path for me
[4102.64 → 4104.98] That's the way of life
[4104.98 → 4106.46] That's where I'm going to find
[4106.46 → 4107.36] The life of the resurrection
[4107.36 → 4109.84] Tim Keller
[4109.84 → 4110.74] In his ministry
[4110.74 → 4112.76] Has famously said that
[4112.76 → 4113.78] For many modern people
[4113.78 → 4115.00] Especially western people
[4115.00 → 4116.40] Accepting Jesus
[4116.40 → 4117.74] Requires a lot of humility
[4117.74 → 4119.00] And he says that
[4119.00 → 4120.00] Because it requires
[4120.00 → 4121.10] That we need to admit
[4121.10 → 4121.86] And this is what's hard
[4121.86 → 4122.60] For western people
[4122.60 → 4123.70] We need to admit
[4123.70 → 4125.36] That we cannot save ourselves
[4125.36 → 4126.50] By our own means
[4126.50 → 4129.20] Your intellect
[4129.20 → 4130.94] Your strength
[4130.94 → 4132.06] Your money
[4132.06 → 4133.92] Cannot save you
[4133.92 → 4136.48] All the energy we have
[4136.48 → 4137.10] Within us
[4137.10 → 4138.20] Cannot save us
[4138.20 → 4139.32] It is receiving
[4139.32 → 4140.24] The gift of grace
[4140.24 → 4141.56] Through the finished work
[4141.56 → 4142.60] Of Jesus on the cross
[4142.60 → 4143.50] That brings us
[4143.50 → 4144.14] Into the family
[4144.14 → 4144.82] Of the resurrection
[4144.82 → 4146.82] And that takes humility
[4146.82 → 4148.42] And perhaps you're here
[4148.42 → 4149.18] For the first time
[4149.18 → 4150.10] You're hearing about Jesus
[4150.10 → 4150.78] For the first time
[4150.78 → 4152.26] I want to invite you
[4152.26 → 4153.28] To explore further
[4153.28 → 4154.86] I want you to have
[4154.86 → 4156.02] Conversations with believers
[4156.02 → 4156.74] In our church
[4156.74 → 4157.92] To take seriously
[4157.92 → 4158.58] The promise
[4158.58 → 4159.18] The gift
[4159.18 → 4160.44] And the responsibility
[4160.44 → 4161.82] To respond in faith
[4161.82 → 4163.34] To what Paul is saying here
[4163.34 → 4166.00] But let me finish
[4166.00 → 4166.92] With how Paul finishes
[4166.92 → 4167.64] This passage
[4167.64 → 4169.20] He moves from us
[4169.20 → 4169.68] Being dead
[4169.68 → 4170.12] In our sins
[4170.12 → 4170.94] And transgressions
[4170.94 → 4171.72] Following the ways
[4171.72 → 4172.24] Of the world
[4172.24 → 4172.86] To saying
[4172.86 → 4173.52] You've been raised
[4173.52 → 4174.08] With Christ
[4174.08 → 4174.90] You've been made alive
[4174.90 → 4175.30] With Christ
[4175.30 → 4175.86] You've been seated
[4175.86 → 4176.44] With Christ
[4176.44 → 4178.06] To the inexpressible
[4178.06 → 4179.40] Gift of grace
[4179.40 → 4180.02] Is going to be coming
[4180.02 → 4180.86] For us in the future
[4180.86 → 4181.90] And then he says
[4181.90 → 4182.70] At the end
[4182.70 → 4184.58] For we are God's
[4184.58 → 4185.28] Handiwork
[4185.28 → 4187.16] Or craftsmanship
[4187.16 → 4188.26] Or masterpiece
[4188.26 → 4190.10] Created in Christ Jesus
[4190.10 → 4191.64] To do good works
[4191.64 → 4192.94] Which God prepared
[4192.94 → 4193.56] In advance
[4193.56 → 4194.66] For us to do
[4194.66 → 4197.04] One writer says
[4197.04 → 4197.70] All the good works
[4197.70 → 4198.26] In the world
[4198.26 → 4199.42] Cannot put us
[4199.42 → 4200.18] Right with God
[4200.18 → 4201.06] But there's something
[4201.06 → 4202.06] Radically wrong
[4202.06 → 4202.64] With Christianity
[4202.64 → 4203.96] That does not result
[4203.96 → 4205.28] In good deeds
[4205.28 → 4207.44] And so the question is
[4207.44 → 4208.26] What does the church do
[4208.26 → 4209.28] With the resurrection life
[4209.28 → 4210.16] We have in Christ
[4210.16 → 4212.34] We give our lives away
[4212.34 → 4213.22] For the sake of the world
[4213.22 → 4216.32] We live with radical
[4216.32 → 4217.66] Open-headed generosity
[4217.66 → 4219.92] Or as one of my favourite
[4219.92 → 4220.76] Writers puts it
[4220.76 → 4221.96] The life of the church
[4221.96 → 4222.78] Is bending down
[4222.78 → 4224.14] And washing the feet
[4224.14 → 4225.14] Of the world
[4225.14 → 4227.16] It is showing
[4227.16 → 4228.46] The selflessness of Christ
[4228.46 → 4229.98] The generosity of Christ
[4229.98 → 4231.40] The very love of Christ
[4231.40 → 4232.52] In your workplace
[4232.52 → 4233.78] In your classroom
[4233.78 → 4234.98] In your cubicle
[4234.98 → 4236.04] In your neighbourhood
[4236.04 → 4237.16] In the hallway
[4237.16 → 4238.14] Of the apartment building
[4238.14 → 4239.36] All of those places
[4239.36 → 4240.64] Think about this
[4240.64 → 4241.34] Those are the places
[4241.34 → 4242.18] Where God has prepared
[4242.18 → 4243.86] Good work in advance
[4243.86 → 4245.24] For you and me to do
[4245.24 → 4246.28] Isn't that something
[4246.28 → 4246.78] To think about?
[4247.16 → 4248.16] There's already good work
[4248.16 → 4248.94] Waiting for you
[4248.94 → 4249.48] This week
[4249.48 → 4250.58] This year
[4250.58 → 4251.62] And for the rest of your life
[4251.62 → 4252.64] By God who wants
[4252.64 → 4253.74] The church to be a source
[4253.74 → 4254.86] Of blessing
[4254.86 → 4256.54] And as they bless
[4256.54 → 4257.62] And serve and love
[4257.62 → 4258.64] They demonstrate
[4258.64 → 4260.46] The life that is to come
[4260.46 → 4261.62] Because of Jesus' resurrection
[4261.62 → 4264.98] Let me finish with this
[4264.98 → 4268.32] From the time of Jesus' resurrection
[4268.32 → 4270.32] There have been many people
[4270.32 → 4270.70] To say
[4270.70 → 4272.10] This is just not possible
[4272.10 → 4273.30] Like this
[4273.30 → 4274.12] It can't happen
[4274.12 → 4276.16] It can't be proved
[4276.16 → 4277.60] It's too unique
[4277.60 → 4278.84] And there have been many people
[4278.84 → 4279.90] Who either privately
[4279.90 → 4280.46] Or publicly
[4280.46 → 4281.18] We would say to Christians
[4281.18 → 4282.14] This is insane
[4282.14 → 4282.96] What you're talking about
[4282.96 → 4284.48] That a person went to the grave
[4284.48 → 4285.52] Was buried in a tomb
[4285.52 → 4287.02] And then rose out of that
[4287.02 → 4287.88] That's just crazy
[4287.88 → 4290.74] And for many generations now
[4290.74 → 4291.40] There have been people
[4291.40 → 4292.76] Called apologists
[4292.76 → 4293.72] Maybe you've heard of this word
[4293.72 → 4295.08] They defend the faith
[4295.08 → 4296.02] And you can look online
[4296.02 → 4297.14] There are tons of people online
[4297.14 → 4298.10] Who are constantly making
[4298.10 → 4299.04] Good arguments
[4299.04 → 4300.52] For why people believe in Jesus
[4300.52 → 4302.30] Good arguments for the resurrection
[4302.30 → 4303.26] And all the rest
[4303.26 → 4304.66] But what struck me
[4304.66 → 4305.64] A number of years ago
[4305.64 → 4306.82] In reading about the early church
[4306.82 → 4308.08] Is that they also had defenders
[4308.08 → 4309.18] Of the faith back then
[4309.18 → 4310.90] But some of their arguments
[4310.90 → 4312.08] Were painfully basic
[4312.08 → 4313.08] And even convicting
[4313.08 → 4314.66] People would come to
[4314.66 → 4315.74] Early church apologists
[4315.74 → 4316.92] In the first and second century
[4316.92 → 4317.24] And they'd say
[4317.24 → 4318.20] This can't be possible
[4318.20 → 4320.02] The resurrection could not have happened
[4320.02 → 4321.56] And you know what their defence was?
[4322.36 → 4323.14] This is crazy
[4323.14 → 4323.84] It's so simple
[4323.84 → 4324.20] They said
[4324.20 → 4324.72] You know what?
[4325.30 → 4326.62] Go find a church
[4326.62 → 4329.28] Go hang out with those believers
[4329.28 → 4331.90] And you will witness
[4331.90 → 4333.66] The life of the resurrection
[4333.66 → 4334.62] Of Jesus Christ
[4334.62 → 4336.06] In believers' lives
[4336.06 → 4338.78] What a defence, hey?
[4340.24 → 4341.26] That invites the church
[4341.26 → 4342.84] To live in the resurrection of Jesus
[4342.84 → 4344.32] If you don't believe
[4344.32 → 4344.74] In the resurrection
[4344.74 → 4346.10] Go find yourself a church
[4346.10 → 4347.40] Live within them for a while
[4347.40 → 4348.14] And what you'll see is
[4348.14 → 4349.64] Yes, the brokenness of the world
[4349.64 → 4351.30] You will see all sorts of pain
[4351.30 → 4352.58] That everyone shares
[4352.58 → 4353.76] All sorts of stuff
[4353.76 → 4354.94] All the hypocrisy of the church
[4354.94 → 4355.88] It's true, by the way
[4355.88 → 4356.52] If you're visiting
[4356.52 → 4357.38] It's all true
[4357.38 → 4359.16] But you will also see
[4359.16 → 4361.46] Some of the most beautiful generosity
[4361.46 → 4364.64] Some of the most beautiful selflessness
[4364.64 → 4368.02] You will see the most kind-hearted people
[4368.02 → 4369.28] Serving one another
[4369.28 → 4370.64] Seeking to serve the city
[4370.64 → 4372.36] In small ways
[4372.36 → 4374.22] Showing the life of the resurrection
[4374.22 → 4377.22] And I want to say
[4377.22 → 4378.16] Church of Jesus Christ
[4378.16 → 4379.04] The work is finished
[4379.04 → 4382.02] Jesus went to the tomb
[4382.02 → 4384.44] He defeated our enemies
[4384.44 → 4386.86] And He rose
[4386.86 → 4388.16] From the dead
[4388.16 → 4390.72] And His resurrection life
[4390.72 → 4393.52] One day
[4393.52 → 4394.82] Is going to fill the earth
[4394.82 → 4396.70] And we will share in that
[4396.70 → 4397.74] By faith in Jesus
[4397.74 → 4398.80] Forever
[4398.80 → 4400.46] And ever
[4400.46 → 4402.32] And ever
[4402.32 → 4403.98] Because of His
[4403.98 → 4405.94] Inexpressible kindness
[4405.94 → 4407.12] To us
[4407.12 → 4409.44] But that resurrection life
[4409.44 → 4410.94] Is also here in the present
[4410.94 → 4413.26] And we are invited
[4413.26 → 4414.38] To put it on display
[4414.38 → 4415.88] In our ordinary lives
[4415.88 → 4417.36] Through the grace
[4417.36 → 4418.06] And the power
[4418.06 → 4418.60] And the love
[4418.60 → 4419.76] That Jesus gives us
[4419.76 → 4421.38] Would you join me in prayer?
[4426.46 → 4427.58] Father, we thank You
[4427.58 → 4428.60] For Jesus Christ
[4428.60 → 4430.14] We thank You
[4430.14 → 4431.26] For sending Your Son
[4431.26 → 4433.22] To defeat Satan
[4433.22 → 4434.30] And sin
[4434.30 → 4435.26] And death
[4435.26 → 4437.52] We pray that You
[4437.52 → 4438.84] Would give us the faith
[4438.84 → 4441.04] To live day by day
[4441.04 → 4442.82] In light of this reality
[4442.82 → 4444.58] We pray that You
[4444.58 → 4445.62] Give us the humility
[4445.62 → 4446.58] To receive
[4446.58 → 4448.34] The gift of salvation
[4448.34 → 4450.24] And we pray Lord
[4450.24 → 4450.96] That You give us
[4450.96 → 4452.18] The strength this week
[4452.18 → 4453.02] And this year
[4453.02 → 4454.80] To live
[4454.80 → 4455.82] In the life
[4455.82 → 4456.78] Of the resurrection
[4456.78 → 4458.68] Would You fill us
[4458.68 → 4459.30] With the fullness
[4459.30 → 4460.32] Of Your Holy Spirit
[4460.32 → 4462.02] Would You compel us
[4462.02 → 4462.98] To show Your love
[4462.98 → 4464.18] Would You give us
[4464.18 → 4464.60] Your life
[4464.60 → 4465.32] We pray this
[4465.32 → 4466.00] In the mighty name
[4466.00 → 4466.42] Of Jesus
[4466.42 → 4467.18] Amen
[4467.18 → 4469.52] I invite you to stand
[4469.52 → 4470.22] And sing with me
[4470.22 → 4471.22] A song of response
[4471.22 → 4471.90] Overcome
[4471.90 → 4474.56] It's an ado
[4474.56 → 4476.80] I invite you to stand
[4476.80 → 4477.00] At my very deep
[4477.00 → 4477.56] If you love
[4477.56 → 4478.72] I invite you to stand
[4478.72 → 4479.68] agitated
[4479.68 → 4480.48] I'll go to head
[4480.66 → 4481.56] At ARK
[4481.62 → 4482.04] Things
[4482.04 → 4482.88] I'd love
[4482.88 → 4484.30] Hab
[4484.30 → 4485.22] After
[4486.66 → 4487.06] This
[4487.06 → 4488.68] It's different
[4488.68 → 4490.80] Us
[4494.48 → 4495.48] We have
[4496.84 → 4498.76] We have
[4498.76 → 4499.22] We're
[4499.22 → 4500.38] We have
[4500.38 → 4501.42] We are
[4501.42 → 4519.54] Seated above, grown in the Father's love
[4519.54 → 4528.42] Fastened to die, poured out for all in time
[4531.42 → 4537.98] God's only Son, perfect and smart as one
[4537.98 → 4546.42] He never saved, suffered as any day
[4546.42 → 4560.42] Authority, every victory is yours
[4561.42 → 4575.42] All authority, every victory is yours
[4575.42 → 4583.42] Saviour, worthy of honour and glory
[4583.42 → 4589.42] Worthy of all of our prayers
[4589.42 → 4592.42] You are a King
[4592.42 → 4601.42] Jesus, awesome in power forever
[4601.42 → 4607.42] Awesome in great is your name
[4607.42 → 4611.42] You are a King
[4611.42 → 4626.42] Power in hand
[4626.42 → 4634.42] Power in hand, speaking of Father's plan
[4634.42 → 4642.42] Sending us out, light in this broken land
[4642.42 → 4644.42] All authority
[4644.42 → 4658.42] All authority, every victory is yours
[4658.42 → 4672.42] All authority, every victory is yours
[4672.42 → 4680.42] Saviour, worthy of honour and glory
[4680.42 → 4686.42] Worthy of all of our prayers
[4686.42 → 4688.42] You are a King
[4688.42 → 4698.42] Jesus, awesome in power forever
[4698.42 → 4702.42] Awesome in great is your name
[4702.42 → 4704.42] You are a King
[4704.42 → 4706.42] You are a King
[4706.42 → 4708.42] Sing
[4708.42 → 4710.42] You are a King
[4710.42 → 4712.42] We will overcome
[4712.42 → 4716.42] By the blood of the Lamb
[4716.42 → 4718.42] In the word of the Lamb
[4718.42 → 4720.42] You are a King
[4720.42 → 4724.42] You are a King
[4724.42 → 4726.42] You are a King
[4726.42 → 4728.42] You are a King
[4728.42 → 4730.42] We will overcome
[4730.42 → 4732.42] We will overcome
[4732.42 → 4734.42] By the blood of the Lamb
[4734.42 → 4736.42] In the word of the Lamb
[4736.42 → 4738.42] In the word of the Lamb
[4738.42 → 4740.42] In the word of our testimony
[4740.42 → 4744.42] Every life overcomes
[4744.42 → 4746.42] We will overcome
[4746.42 → 4748.42] We will overcome
[4748.42 → 4750.42] By the blood of the Lamb
[4750.42 → 4752.42] In the word of our testimony
[4752.42 → 4754.42] Every life overcomes
[4754.42 → 4756.42] Lord of our testimony
[4756.42 → 4758.42] Every life overcomes
[4758.42 → 4761.42] Every life overcomes
[4761.42 → 4762.42] Saviour
[4762.42 → 4764.42] Worthy of all of our prayers
[4764.42 → 4767.42] You are a King
[4767.42 → 4768.42] Jesus
[4768.42 → 4769.42] You are a King
[4769.42 → 4770.42] You are a King
[4770.42 → 4771.42] Jesus
[4771.42 → 4772.42] You are a King
[4772.42 → 4776.42] You are a King
[4776.42 → 4780.44] You overcame
[4780.44 → 4782.24] Jesus
[4782.24 → 4784.96] Jesus
[4784.96 → 4789.46] Awesome in power forever
[4789.46 → 4793.94] Awesome and great is your name
[4793.94 → 4797.78] You overcame
[4797.78 → 4800.04] Sing it one last time
[4800.04 → 4800.88] Saviour
[4800.88 → 4803.12] Saviour
[4803.12 → 4808.02] Worthy of honour and glory
[4808.02 → 4814.04] Worthy of all of our praise
[4814.04 → 4816.76] You overcame
[4816.76 → 4821.48] Jesus
[4821.48 → 4826.04] Awesome in power forever
[4826.04 → 4831.70] Awesome and great is your name
[4831.70 → 4833.70] You overcame
[4834.70 → 4836.70] You overcame
[4836.70 → 4838.70] You overcame
[4838.70 → 4843.70] You overcame
[4843.70 → 4851.18] Amen
[4851.18 → 4851.48] Amen
[4851.48 → 4856.00] Don't worry we get to sing one more song still
[4856.00 → 4860.86] One really basic housekeeping thing is if you're new to our church
[4860.86 → 4863.82] The 11 a.m. service only the 11 a.m. has to do this
[4863.82 → 4866.22] You have to break down the chairs and put them on the sides
[4866.22 → 4869.42] We have a number of events and ministries throughout the week that happen here
[4869.42 → 4871.90] So after we sing you can break down the chairs
[4871.90 → 4874.92] After that you are invited to stay as long as you want
[4874.92 → 4877.22] For coffee and fellowship
[4877.22 → 4879.28] Get to know some people you haven't met before
[4879.28 → 4880.90] Talk about your day
[4880.90 → 4881.88] Talk about your life
[4881.88 → 4883.02] Share fellowship together
[4883.02 → 4886.72] Before I read a prayer that comes from Ephesians chapter 3
[4886.72 → 4889.88] Let me say something we've said a number of times throughout the last few weeks
[4889.88 → 4892.48] There is no place you go
[4892.48 → 4896.84] Where Jesus Christ our resurrected lord does not go with you
[4896.84 → 4899.62] There is no hardship you face
[4899.62 → 4901.32] That you face alone
[4901.32 → 4904.92] There is no pain that you carry that he does not share with you
[4904.92 → 4910.70] Jesus Christ our resurrected king goes with us into the whole of our lives this week
[4910.70 → 4914.26] So receive this prayer from Ephesians chapter 3
[4914.26 → 4921.44] For this reason I kneel before the father from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name
[4921.44 → 4924.56] I pray that out of his glorious riches
[4924.56 → 4929.10] He may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being
[4929.10 → 4932.84] So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith
[4932.84 → 4937.46] And I pray that you being rooted and established in love
[4937.46 → 4939.20] That you may have power
[4939.20 → 4946.02] Together with all the lord's people to grasp how wide and long and high and deep
[4946.02 → 4948.02] Is the love of Christ
[4948.02 → 4951.18] And to know that this love surpasses knowledge
[4951.18 → 4955.22] That you might be filled to the measure of all the fullness of god
[4955.22 → 4960.06] Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more
[4960.06 → 4963.84] Than all we ask or even imagine
[4963.84 → 4967.30] According to his power that is at work within us
[4967.30 → 4969.18] To him be the glory in the church
[4969.18 → 4971.92] And in Christ Jesus throughout all generations
[4971.92 → 4974.70] Now and forever
[4974.70 → 4976.24] Amen
[4976.24 → 4979.54] Let's sing our final song of resurrection hope

[5000.62 → 5017.46] I long to breathe the air of heaven
[5017.46 → 5023.96] Where He is gone and mercy fills the stream

[5069.20 → 5078.24] Every breath of pain and desperation
[5078.24 → 5081.88] The songs of faith

[5084.00 → 5088.84] In the end

[5128.44 → 5134.20] On that day
[5134.20 → 5137.80] We join the resurrection
[5137.80 → 5144.70] And stand beside the heroes of the day
[5144.70 → 5148.08] With one voice
[5148.08 → 5151.82] A thousand generations
[5151.82 → 5154.46] Sing
[5154.46 → 5157.46] Sing
[5157.46 → 5158.90] Sing it again
[5158.90 → 5159.74] On that day
[5159.74 → 5162.34] On that day
[5162.34 → 5165.78] We join the resurrection
[5165.78 → 5168.46] And stand beside
[5168.46 → 5170.10] The heroes of the day
[5170.10 → 5172.10] The heroes of the day
[5172.10 → 5176.10] Live on voice
[5176.10 → 5179.66] A thousand generations
[5179.66 → 5182.10] Sing
[5182.10 → 5186.10] Worthy is the Lamb who will sing
[5186.10 → 5188.74] Forever
[5188.74 → 5192.74] Forever He shall reign
[5192.74 → 5195.74] So let it be today
[5195.74 → 5199.58] We shout the hymn of heaven
[5199.58 → 5203.34] With angels and the saints
[5203.34 → 5207.06] We raise a mighty roar
[5207.06 → 5210.16] Glory to our God
[5210.16 → 5215.02] For gave us life beyond the grave
[5215.02 → 5221.56] Holy, holy is the Lord

[5273.76 → 5303.74] Thank you.
