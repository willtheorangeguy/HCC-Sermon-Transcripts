[0.00 → 2.38] you lead us into worship and that really is a gift.
[9.16 → 13.00] Well, we're going to continue our series called The Good Fight.
[13.78 → 18.48] And we've been opening up over the last couple of weeks the way in which the Christian life is a life of struggle.
[19.06 → 25.10] It's a life of battle against the flesh, against idolatrous patterns in our world, and against Satan.
[25.62 → 30.04] Pastor Jonathan last week preached on the way in which Jesus, before his earthly ministry began,
[30.50 → 32.08] was tempted by Satan in the wilderness.
[32.78 → 38.88] And this morning we're looking at how that same scheme of Satan, the same tempting of Satan, is present in our lives today.
[39.24 → 42.76] And we want to look not only at its reality, but how we take our stand.
[42.90 → 47.32] So if you have your Bible, whether it's physical or digital, turn with me to Ephesians 6,
[47.42 → 50.96] and we're going to read some pretty important words about spiritual warfare.
[55.10 → 59.70] Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
[60.72 → 65.54] Put on the full armour of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
[66.58 → 72.50] For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities,
[73.12 → 78.28] against the powers of this dark world, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
[78.28 → 83.00] Therefore, put on the full armour of God so that when the day of evil comes,
[83.24 → 88.60] you may be able to take to stand your ground, and after everything is done, to stand.
[89.72 → 92.94] Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist,
[93.48 → 95.72] with the breastplate of righteousness in place,
[96.00 → 100.08] and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.
[100.84 → 103.34] In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith,
[103.46 → 106.76] with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
[106.76 → 112.04] Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,
[112.72 → 117.40] and pray in the Spirit on all occasions, with all kinds of prayers and requests.
[117.78 → 122.66] With this in mind, be alert, and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people.
[122.66 → 130.66] A few years ago now, I had the privilege of leading an alpha class.
[131.20 → 134.92] An alpha, if you're not sure what it is, is meant to introduce the Christian faith
[134.92 → 137.30] to people who might be interested or seeking.
[138.22 → 141.64] But this particular class was a bit unique because it wasn't run by our church,
[141.70 → 144.30] it was run by the school across the road from our church,
[144.58 → 146.98] and the circumstances that brought people in were unique.
[146.98 → 150.40] You see, you could enrol your children in this Christian school,
[150.60 → 154.76] but if you as parents weren't believers, you were required to take an alpha class,
[154.82 → 157.44] which I think was great, but that meant there were some parents
[157.44 → 159.96] who were very interested in Christianity and interested in learning,
[160.12 → 162.92] and there were some parents who were not interested in Christianity,
[163.18 → 166.84] but were willing to jump through the alpha hoop to get their kids in this school.
[167.82 → 170.46] And so on many occasions, as we were going through the material,
[170.58 → 172.76] talking about the Bible, I could feel that resistance,
[172.94 → 174.58] like, what is this Christianity stuff?
[174.58 → 176.18] Like, why are we talking about this?
[176.70 → 178.86] But I did not feel it more strongly than on the week
[178.86 → 182.60] where we were talking about the Holy Spirit and spiritual warfare.
[183.34 → 185.54] I remember just this sense of, like, when we gathered,
[185.68 → 187.94] I was just taking people on the train to crazy town.
[188.04 → 191.52] Like, here we go, we're talking about spiritual warfare and the Holy Spirit.
[192.44 → 196.30] The question that we started a whole evening with was this question.
[197.18 → 199.24] We sat around the tables, and the question was,
[199.56 → 203.96] have you ever had a spiritual experience that might be difficult to explain?
[204.58 → 208.48] And much to my surprise, the tables sort of erupted into conversation.
[209.26 → 212.38] A lot of people just started sharing about experiences they've had
[212.38 → 213.64] that maybe they hadn't shared before,
[213.74 → 215.24] or strange things they've experienced,
[215.42 → 217.38] miraculous healings that their family has known,
[217.68 → 222.24] and also dark stuff that they didn't know what to make sense of,
[222.28 → 224.78] sort of demonic activity that sort of manifested itself
[224.78 → 226.62] in certain people's lives or in their homes.
[226.96 → 228.58] And as I heard this, I was like, whoa.
[229.42 → 231.58] I wonder if we created this conversation more,
[231.58 → 234.14] we'd hear more stories, positive and struggling,
[234.72 → 238.04] of spiritual experiences, healing and possession,
[239.18 → 240.64] miracles and darkness.
[242.64 → 247.48] You should know that the campus chaplain that Jonathan referenced earlier,
[247.60 → 249.80] Todd Stat ham, he does work among students,
[249.90 → 251.14] Christian and non-Christian at UBC,
[251.26 → 253.26] and he said one of the most popular podcasts
[253.26 → 255.42] among students he's in conversation with
[255.42 → 258.04] is a podcast called The Exorcist Files
[258.04 → 260.60] by Catholic priest Carlos Martins.
[260.94 → 262.94] And it just reminds me that even though we might not know
[262.94 → 264.74] how to talk about darkness and evil,
[265.20 → 266.96] there's a great interest in this
[266.96 → 268.34] and perhaps a lot of experience
[268.34 → 270.58] that people are trying to figure out with this.
[272.38 → 275.24] Ephesians 6 has a lot to say about darkness.
[275.50 → 278.38] In fact, the first half of Ephesians 6 basically says,
[278.78 → 280.12] Satan's schemes are real,
[280.56 → 282.12] the powers and the principalities
[282.12 → 284.34] and unseen forces in our world are real,
[284.48 → 285.36] and the second half is,
[285.64 → 288.36] here's how we as Christians take our stand against them.
[288.70 → 290.56] So we're going to look first at what Paul says
[290.56 → 293.14] about the powers and the principalities and the devil,
[293.48 → 294.56] and then we're going to look together
[294.56 → 296.52] at how in the world we take our stand
[296.52 → 298.60] against these forces and these powers.
[299.56 → 302.36] Let me read for us verse 10 to 13 again.
[302.36 → 307.04] Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
[307.76 → 309.02] Put on the full armour of God
[309.02 → 310.76] so that you can take your stand
[310.76 → 312.14] against the devil's schemes.
[312.98 → 316.90] For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[317.36 → 318.50] but against the rulers,
[319.18 → 320.12] the authorities,
[320.60 → 322.56] the powers of this dark world,
[322.62 → 324.68] and the spiritual forces of evil
[324.68 → 326.36] in the heavenly realms.
[327.54 → 329.10] Now I'm just going to be honest with you
[329.10 → 330.46] that when I was studying this passage,
[330.46 → 332.56] I wanted to figure out all these distinctions
[332.56 → 334.70] and what Paul meant with each of these lines,
[335.08 → 337.10] and I took some comfort because it was confusing,
[337.30 → 338.24] and one of the commentators,
[338.36 → 339.32] I don't have this on the screen,
[339.40 → 340.68] this is what he said about this line.
[340.76 → 341.02] He says,
[341.44 → 344.80] Paul's point is not to produce a precise list
[344.80 → 347.64] of species that inhabit the heavenly realms.
[348.24 → 351.70] His point is to signify the vast multiplicity
[351.70 → 354.88] of demonic forces that are allied against the church.
[357.02 → 358.56] Now what in the world does this mean?
[358.56 → 361.18] Does this mean that the car accident
[361.18 → 362.30] you nearly got in
[362.30 → 364.52] was Satan attacking you two weeks ago?
[365.10 → 366.54] No, you're probably just a bad driver.
[368.14 → 369.18] Just deal with it.
[370.08 → 372.98] But does this mean that there are real active forces of evil
[372.98 → 375.50] in our world that operate influence in our lives,
[375.56 → 376.06] in our city?
[376.68 → 378.28] Absolutely it does.
[379.46 → 380.74] And I'll just say honestly
[380.74 → 382.42] that there are two times in my life,
[382.54 → 383.70] actually before that I would say,
[383.82 → 386.06] this would have sounded crazy to my younger self,
[386.06 → 387.78] but there's two times now
[387.78 → 388.88] where I've been at gatherings
[388.88 → 390.78] where there is someone who had an evil spirit,
[391.10 → 392.42] and there were people who prayed for them,
[392.50 → 393.28] and the spirit was gone.
[393.94 → 395.84] One person that I know very well
[395.84 → 397.74] had an experience of a demon leaving them,
[397.92 → 399.28] and what was so heartbreaking to me
[399.28 → 401.32] is they didn't share for years that this happened
[401.32 → 402.38] because they were afraid
[402.38 → 404.16] of what Christians might think of them,
[404.30 → 405.64] or how they might judge them,
[405.68 → 406.72] or think that they're strange
[406.72 → 407.80] for having this experience.
[407.80 → 411.18] But even if I didn't have these experiences
[411.18 → 412.04] and conversations,
[412.70 → 414.62] the scripture is so abundantly clear.
[415.30 → 417.04] Satan tempts Jesus, that's in the word.
[417.40 → 420.16] Jesus and his ministry is constantly casting out
[420.16 → 421.70] and showing his authority over demons,
[422.02 → 423.96] and throughout the church today,
[425.04 → 425.92] demons are real.
[426.50 → 427.68] Pastors cast them out.
[428.22 → 430.10] Churches need to deal with the forces of darkness
[430.10 → 430.96] that are at work in them,
[431.02 → 432.52] and that's just reality,
[432.94 → 435.34] whether we normally talk about it or not.
[435.34 → 438.72] But I want to just name something
[438.72 → 440.26] that has already been asked to me,
[440.50 → 441.78] and maybe you've thought it.
[442.26 → 443.42] And the question comes like this.
[443.50 → 444.56] It came to me like this.
[444.60 → 445.30] Okay, Dave, like,
[445.38 → 447.60] we believe that personal demonic forces are real,
[447.68 → 449.06] that people have spiritual attacks,
[449.18 → 449.88] these things are real,
[449.96 → 450.72] Christians in the church.
[451.08 → 453.14] Why don't we see that very often in Canada?
[454.12 → 454.36] Right?
[454.42 → 455.26] Have you asked that question?
[456.24 → 456.96] Some of you did.
[456.98 → 457.74] I know you asked me.
[458.06 → 460.20] Or why is this not more normal in Canada?
[460.28 → 462.08] Like, what's with the way Satan
[462.08 → 463.36] might operate in our culture?
[463.50 → 464.78] And I just want to invite you
[464.78 → 466.10] and how I've been working this out
[466.10 → 467.22] and struggling through this.
[467.80 → 468.74] I believe, number one,
[468.80 → 470.52] that personal demonic attacks are real.
[470.58 → 471.96] So I just want to say that unequivocally,
[472.08 → 473.08] even here in Canada.
[473.82 → 474.56] But secondly,
[474.70 → 476.42] I want to suggest that Satan knows
[476.42 → 478.60] how to operate in every single culture.
[479.42 → 480.36] He's very smart.
[481.06 → 481.94] He's very clever.
[482.06 → 483.48] He's been around for a long time.
[483.54 → 484.72] He knows the systems
[484.72 → 486.68] and the cultures that we operate in.
[486.68 → 487.74] And I want to suggest
[487.74 → 489.82] that there's a very dark, insidious way
[489.82 → 491.16] that Satan works in Canada
[491.16 → 492.02] and other places
[492.02 → 493.62] that's right under your nose
[493.62 → 495.16] and you'd never even notice it.
[495.80 → 497.72] And I'm going to put it this way.
[498.42 → 499.40] There are lies.
[499.52 → 501.06] Remember, Pastor Jonathan mentioned that
[501.06 → 503.04] Satan's primary mode of operation
[503.04 → 504.56] is actually lying.
[505.10 → 505.30] Right?
[505.78 → 507.48] Deceiving, sort of twisting the truth.
[507.56 → 508.52] And that lie gets sort of
[508.52 → 510.04] sown in societies.
[510.16 → 511.36] It gets sown in human lives.
[511.48 → 513.22] And then it sort of just grows up
[513.22 → 514.00] into society
[514.00 → 515.76] and becomes a normal part of how we live.
[516.62 → 518.00] Some of Satan's best work
[518.00 → 519.12] is the stuff that we just think
[519.12 → 520.64] is the normal stuff of life.
[521.08 → 522.40] The way society operates.
[522.52 → 523.56] The way people live.
[524.18 → 526.18] That scripture clearly describes as sin.
[527.48 → 529.30] Let me give you four specific examples.
[529.44 → 530.52] And these I've built out
[530.52 → 532.56] off of some of the wisdom of other people.
[533.56 → 534.92] Here are four questions.
[535.28 → 535.58] First,
[536.26 → 537.44] why would Satan worry
[537.44 → 539.08] about whispering lies in your ear
[539.08 → 539.94] about lust
[539.94 → 541.80] when he could help form
[541.80 → 544.08] a multi-billion dollar industry,
[544.34 → 545.96] that is the pornography industry,
[545.96 → 547.98] that will enslave people,
[548.50 → 549.58] destroy relationships
[549.58 → 551.50] under the insidious lie
[551.50 → 553.22] that we're just enjoying ourselves
[553.22 → 555.28] and having personal expression?
[557.36 → 559.52] Why would Satan worry about lying
[559.52 → 560.68] or whispering in your ear
[560.68 → 562.28] that you need to waste money
[562.28 → 564.14] when he could help form
[564.14 → 565.42] a whole society
[565.42 → 567.68] that builds on the lie
[567.68 → 568.70] that we will experience
[568.70 → 569.88] our deepest satisfaction
[569.88 → 570.82] through purchasing
[570.82 → 572.08] and accumulation?
[572.08 → 575.38] Why would Satan whisper
[575.38 → 576.02] in your ear
[576.02 → 577.06] words of vanity
[577.06 → 578.10] when he can help shape
[578.10 → 579.18] a whole society
[579.18 → 580.06] and industry
[580.06 → 581.42] around self-worship
[581.42 → 582.74] and self-love?
[583.70 → 584.80] Why would Satan whisper
[584.80 → 585.72] words in your ears
[585.72 → 587.10] about anger and revenge
[587.10 → 588.20] when he can help form
[588.20 → 589.32] a whole society
[589.32 → 591.44] that is increasingly trivialized,
[591.80 → 592.18] polarized,
[592.60 → 593.50] where we are invited
[593.50 → 594.30] by social media
[594.30 → 595.36] to hate those
[595.36 → 596.46] whom we disagree with?
[597.60 → 598.54] Could it be that
[598.54 → 599.90] some of his best work
[599.90 → 602.52] is just part of our normal society?
[603.52 → 604.74] Is that resonating with you?
[606.28 → 607.36] And if this is true,
[607.44 → 607.80] by the way,
[607.88 → 608.22] this is,
[608.36 → 609.28] I find this a bit chilling,
[609.70 → 610.30] but if that's true,
[610.36 → 611.20] then spiritual warfare
[611.20 → 612.54] is not just praying
[612.54 → 613.80] through the specific attacks
[613.80 → 614.54] that you might have
[614.54 → 615.46] from demonic activity,
[615.62 → 616.50] although that's true.
[617.00 → 618.24] Spiritual warfare happens
[618.24 → 619.40] when you open your phone
[619.40 → 620.64] and you're scrolling the internet.
[621.34 → 622.44] Spiritual warfare happens
[622.44 → 623.14] when you're messaging
[623.14 → 623.82] with your friends
[623.82 → 624.68] through social media.
[625.20 → 626.40] Spiritual warfare happens
[626.40 → 627.68] when you step into the cubicle
[627.68 → 629.00] or you open your laptop
[629.00 → 630.28] and you're looking at your stocks
[630.28 → 631.38] and your ETFs.
[632.60 → 633.84] Spiritual warfare happens
[633.84 → 635.24] when you walk through the mall.
[636.34 → 638.06] And I have a particular disdain
[638.06 → 638.52] for the mall.
[638.68 → 639.78] I don't know if I've talked about that
[639.78 → 640.40] behind the pulpit,
[640.80 → 641.70] but if you ever walk
[641.70 → 642.88] with your kids through a mall,
[643.06 → 644.32] that's when you really feel it.
[644.64 → 645.68] You look at the ads,
[645.82 → 648.16] all the very carefully crafted ads,
[648.26 → 649.48] all the explicit materials
[649.48 → 649.94] on the wall
[649.94 → 650.86] that are just luring you
[650.86 → 651.62] into purchasing
[651.62 → 653.14] as a hope of somehow
[653.14 → 654.24] finding satisfaction.
[655.30 → 656.06] Spiritual warfare
[656.06 → 658.70] is in every section
[658.70 → 659.70] of society.
[661.24 → 663.06] And some of Satan's best work
[663.06 → 665.90] is normalizing sin.
[667.08 → 667.94] This is a conversation
[667.94 → 668.66] for another day,
[668.74 → 669.32] but I've been sort of
[669.32 → 670.16] working out this week
[670.16 → 671.06] that some of the things
[671.06 → 671.84] that I struggle with
[671.84 → 673.04] are how the insidiousness
[673.04 → 673.76] of some sin
[673.76 → 675.46] is repackaged
[675.46 → 676.42] in Canadian society
[676.42 → 677.06] as empowerment,
[677.42 → 678.46] as the good life,
[678.68 → 679.66] as enjoying the way
[679.66 → 680.28] you want to live.
[680.30 → 680.56] And you're like,
[680.62 → 680.98] wait a minute,
[681.36 → 682.22] when I read the scripture,
[682.34 → 683.88] this is like terrible stuff
[683.88 → 684.94] that's going to wreck relationship,
[684.94 → 686.12] but when I walk through the mall
[686.12 → 687.28] or I'm browsing on the internet,
[687.50 → 689.38] these things are being celebrated.
[690.54 → 692.00] That's the insidiousness
[692.00 → 693.38] of Satan's lies.
[695.30 → 697.16] And now the news gets worse,
[697.20 → 697.50] by the way,
[697.54 → 698.12] in Ephesians 6.
[698.18 → 698.72] If this is sort of
[698.72 → 699.84] feeling pretty heavy for you
[699.84 → 700.94] and it's feeling close to home,
[701.02 → 701.90] which I hope it does,
[702.38 → 703.16] it gets worse
[703.16 → 704.36] because what Paul wants you
[704.36 → 705.44] to know unequivocally
[705.44 → 706.72] is that you and me
[706.72 → 707.72] in our own strength
[707.72 → 709.00] cannot fight
[709.00 → 710.78] this kind of spiritual work,
[711.10 → 712.72] this kind of force of darkness
[712.72 → 713.34] and the powers
[713.34 → 714.14] and the principalities
[714.14 → 714.80] that come at us,
[714.92 → 715.72] not just personally
[715.72 → 717.10] through spiritual attack,
[717.34 → 718.38] but systemically
[718.38 → 719.70] in the normalizing of sin
[719.70 → 720.42] in our society
[720.42 → 721.36] and all the temptation
[721.36 → 722.16] that comes with it.
[724.14 → 726.74] Satan is a very smart person,
[727.32 → 728.38] a being, I should say.
[728.82 → 729.44] He's been around
[729.44 → 730.80] a lot longer than you and me.
[731.10 → 732.76] He understands how God is working.
[732.88 → 734.52] He understands the plan of God.
[734.74 → 736.06] He understands the work of Jesus.
[736.22 → 737.08] And isn't it interesting,
[737.20 → 738.72] as Pastor Jonathan mentioned last week,
[739.10 → 740.62] Satan knows the scriptures.
[742.12 → 742.96] You ever thought about that?
[742.96 → 744.78] He probably knows the scriptures
[744.78 → 746.28] a lot better than us.
[746.72 → 748.00] And his tempting power,
[748.36 → 749.58] the ways he works insidiously
[749.58 → 750.34] in society,
[750.54 → 752.72] we do not have the strength
[752.72 → 754.60] to battle that on our own.
[756.06 → 757.64] And once that hits you,
[757.70 → 758.88] I hope you start to see
[758.88 → 760.44] how Ephesians 6 is good news.
[761.72 → 763.08] Because what Paul says
[763.08 → 763.68] in the beginning,
[763.80 → 764.82] and then he works it at the end,
[764.88 → 765.02] is,
[765.26 → 765.80] hey church,
[766.74 → 767.84] you can stand.
[767.84 → 771.24] You now have the ability
[771.24 → 773.46] to resist the fiery arrows of Satan.
[773.70 → 774.48] You have the ability
[774.48 → 775.42] to stand against
[775.42 → 777.12] what might be normalized in society,
[777.12 → 778.32] but you know is sin
[778.32 → 779.44] because of Jesus.
[780.22 → 781.18] Can I read the beginning
[781.18 → 782.92] and then how Paul works this out
[782.92 → 783.46] in the end?
[783.56 → 784.24] Listen to what he says
[784.24 → 784.78] in verse 10.
[785.16 → 785.48] Finally,
[785.62 → 787.44] be strong in the Lord
[787.44 → 789.96] and in his mighty power.
[790.40 → 792.04] Put on the full armour of God
[792.04 → 794.02] so that you can take your stand
[794.02 → 796.08] against the devil's schemes.
[798.26 → 799.22] Good news, church.
[799.80 → 800.74] There is a power
[800.74 → 801.60] greater than Satan.
[802.30 → 803.88] There is a man stronger,
[804.08 → 805.04] as the scriptures put it,
[805.12 → 805.98] than the man who comes
[805.98 → 807.08] in to plunder and kill
[807.08 → 807.60] and destroy,
[807.70 → 808.34] and that is Jesus.
[809.08 → 810.00] There is an authority
[810.00 → 811.16] higher than the forces
[811.16 → 813.00] of evil and demonic realms,
[813.36 → 814.46] and that is our Lord
[814.46 → 815.00] and Saviour,
[815.20 → 815.86] Jesus Christ,
[815.96 → 817.90] who rules supreme.
[819.58 → 821.56] A very moving story for me
[821.56 → 823.06] is I was working
[823.06 → 824.00] through the book of Mark
[824.00 → 824.38] with a number
[824.38 → 825.50] of international students.
[826.28 → 826.82] Many of them
[826.82 → 827.86] were sort of just figuring out
[827.86 → 828.40] reading the Bible
[828.40 → 829.26] for the first time,
[829.80 → 830.50] and one of them,
[830.58 → 831.44] as we were reading through Mark,
[831.50 → 833.36] was noticing over and over again
[833.36 → 834.82] how whenever Jesus encounters,
[835.06 → 835.46] first,
[835.52 → 836.60] that he encounters demons
[836.60 → 837.40] all the time,
[837.84 → 838.90] that he casts them out
[838.90 → 839.96] over and over and over
[839.96 → 841.08] with such ease.
[841.76 → 842.76] And in Mark 1.24,
[842.92 → 843.46] I remember having
[843.46 → 844.36] a conversation with him
[844.36 → 845.12] about how moving
[845.12 → 845.98] this story was.
[846.46 → 847.86] But Jesus encounters a man,
[848.28 → 849.80] he is filled with evil spirits,
[849.98 → 850.94] and one of the spirits
[850.94 → 852.20] speaks to Jesus saying,
[852.20 → 854.54] what do you want with us,
[854.78 → 856.06] Jesus of Nazareth?
[856.44 → 858.40] Have you come to destroy us?
[858.42 → 860.34] I mean, what an interesting statement
[860.34 → 861.84] that shows they know
[861.84 → 862.62] the power of Jesus.
[863.26 → 863.94] You are,
[864.10 → 865.28] we know who you are,
[865.68 → 867.66] the Holy One of God.
[868.66 → 869.64] You know what Jesus does?
[870.64 → 871.60] He casts out the demons
[871.60 → 873.54] and shows his authority
[873.54 → 874.40] and his power.
[875.28 → 875.96] And I want you to know
[875.96 → 877.02] that this is not just a one-off,
[877.10 → 877.94] Jesus does it throughout
[877.94 → 878.56] his ministry,
[878.68 → 879.72] and his ministry is moving
[879.72 → 880.72] closer and closer
[880.72 → 881.20] and closer and closer
[881.20 → 881.82] to the cross
[881.82 → 883.18] because he has come
[883.18 → 884.84] not just to rescue the world
[884.84 → 885.92] from the power of sin
[885.92 → 887.50] and the power of the idolatrous
[887.50 → 888.34] systems in the world,
[888.46 → 890.08] but to defeat and crush
[890.08 → 891.14] once and for all
[891.14 → 892.36] the work of Satan.
[893.22 → 894.54] He has come to extinguish
[894.54 → 895.50] the fiery arrows
[895.50 → 896.68] through the cross.
[897.94 → 899.60] And until Jesus comes
[899.60 → 901.12] in glory and power
[901.12 → 902.72] to banish the forces of darkness
[902.72 → 903.76] once and for all
[903.76 → 904.42] from his world,
[905.16 → 907.16] he has given us everything,
[907.16 → 909.54] and I do mean everything we need
[909.54 → 911.06] to take our stand.
[912.18 → 913.14] As one writer puts it,
[913.18 → 914.00] God has given us
[914.00 → 916.34] all the armour we need,
[917.00 → 918.68] the resources that are sufficient.
[918.84 → 919.62] And now I want to spend
[919.62 → 921.12] a few minutes looking at
[921.12 → 922.22] perhaps what is the most
[922.22 → 923.60] well-known part of this passage,
[923.70 → 925.06] which is the armour of God.
[926.80 → 928.18] It may be worth pointing out
[928.18 → 929.78] that when Paul writes this,
[929.84 → 930.84] one commentator suggests,
[930.90 → 931.00] you know,
[931.06 → 932.12] Paul spent a lot of his time
[932.12 → 932.80] in house arrest,
[933.20 → 934.48] and there was a centurion
[934.48 → 934.90] that would have been
[934.90 → 935.64] guarding his house,
[935.70 → 936.28] and I have a feeling,
[936.28 → 937.22] it's like this image.
[937.52 → 938.34] He's always looking
[938.34 → 938.98] at this soldier,
[939.08 → 939.26] and he's like,
[939.30 → 939.76] you know what?
[939.98 → 941.28] I'm going to use that soldier,
[941.50 → 942.08] and I'm going to use it
[942.08 → 943.50] as an image for how we stand
[943.50 → 944.82] against the forces of darkness.
[945.58 → 947.00] So there are six items
[947.00 → 948.56] of armour that Paul names.
[949.14 → 950.06] Three that we wear,
[950.18 → 951.00] three that we hold,
[951.06 → 951.76] and I want to work through
[951.76 → 953.10] these one at a time briefly.
[954.84 → 956.08] Believers first and foremost
[956.08 → 957.14] wear what is called
[957.14 → 958.66] the belt of truth.
[960.20 → 961.62] You know what's really important?
[962.56 → 964.02] It's knowing what is true.
[964.02 → 966.18] If the devil works
[966.18 → 967.70] in confusion and lies,
[968.06 → 969.54] one very powerful thing
[969.54 → 970.72] is being a group of people
[970.72 → 973.14] who know what is true.
[973.76 → 975.12] And once you know what is true,
[975.22 → 976.06] you actually are ready
[976.06 → 976.54] for battling
[976.54 → 977.54] because you can speak
[977.54 → 977.96] in the truth
[977.96 → 979.82] and you can live in the truth.
[980.48 → 981.78] And that is a very powerful thing,
[981.86 → 982.94] and there are so many illustrations
[982.94 → 984.18] throughout world history
[984.18 → 985.96] of lies being sown in society,
[986.04 → 986.98] and then there's this little group
[986.98 → 987.32] of people,
[987.42 → 988.24] this remnant of people
[988.24 → 988.48] who say,
[988.56 → 990.00] no, we know the truth.
[990.36 → 991.28] We're going to live in it,
[991.28 → 992.60] and people see the power of truth
[992.60 → 993.92] being embodied in a community.
[994.82 → 995.52] Christians are those
[995.52 → 996.72] who wear the belt of truth.
[996.82 → 997.72] They know Christ.
[998.58 → 999.50] They know the scriptures.
[1000.24 → 1001.18] They know the gospel,
[1001.30 → 1001.58] and therefore,
[1001.70 → 1002.66] they know who they are
[1002.66 → 1003.92] and who is in control
[1003.92 → 1004.52] in this world.
[1006.12 → 1006.44] Secondly,
[1006.60 → 1008.02] believers wear the breastplate
[1008.02 → 1008.66] of righteousness.
[1009.34 → 1010.18] Now, the breastplate
[1010.18 → 1011.20] in a Roman soldier
[1011.20 → 1012.16] would be protecting
[1012.16 → 1013.68] the vital organs right here.
[1013.68 → 1015.08] And the breastplate
[1015.08 → 1015.54] of righteousness
[1015.54 → 1017.22] is basically a recognition
[1017.22 → 1019.82] that we have been delivered,
[1020.64 → 1021.94] and we, by the work of Jesus,
[1022.04 → 1022.58] have been brought
[1022.58 → 1024.54] into right relationship with God.
[1024.98 → 1026.00] In fact, I think the best way
[1026.00 → 1027.06] to translate the word righteous
[1027.06 → 1028.70] is right related.
[1028.82 → 1030.36] We are now brought close to God,
[1030.50 → 1031.90] and we are protected by Him.
[1033.40 → 1035.40] Thirdly, believers wear the sandals
[1035.40 → 1036.86] of the gospel of peace.
[1037.46 → 1038.94] And I'm not going to get into
[1038.94 → 1039.60] some of the details
[1039.60 → 1041.30] of how differently people translate
[1041.30 → 1042.24] what this means,
[1042.24 → 1043.70] but I think there's two really
[1043.70 → 1045.56] powerful overlapping meanings here.
[1045.64 → 1046.12] One is,
[1046.68 → 1048.06] a way of defending ourselves
[1048.06 → 1049.10] against the work of Satan
[1049.10 → 1050.76] is sharing the gospel,
[1051.46 → 1052.98] is speaking about the person
[1052.98 → 1053.72] who is life,
[1054.08 → 1054.66] about the person
[1054.66 → 1055.50] who has defeated Satan,
[1055.54 → 1056.16] and that is Jesus,
[1056.24 → 1057.18] so evangelism.
[1057.66 → 1058.60] But part of that is
[1058.60 → 1059.18] the recognition
[1059.18 → 1061.10] that the gospel is peace.
[1062.10 → 1062.64] Satan is the one
[1062.64 → 1063.90] who splits and divides.
[1064.08 → 1064.50] Satan is the one
[1064.50 → 1065.40] who sort of cuts through
[1065.40 → 1066.20] and gets a wedge
[1066.20 → 1067.08] between relationships,
[1067.08 → 1068.28] and the gospel is that
[1068.28 → 1069.90] which unifies Jew and Gentile,
[1070.02 → 1070.66] slave and free,
[1070.82 → 1071.48] male and female,
[1071.48 → 1073.52] into the life of Jesus Christ.
[1073.96 → 1075.20] And so the very thing we share
[1075.20 → 1077.26] is the thing that is peace.
[1079.66 → 1081.12] Now there are the things we hold,
[1081.20 → 1082.52] the shield of faith.
[1083.88 → 1084.98] One of the most dangerous things
[1084.98 → 1085.46] in warfare
[1085.46 → 1088.04] was the flaming arrows.
[1088.88 → 1089.92] And that was a regular part
[1089.92 → 1091.24] of warfare in the first century.
[1091.50 → 1092.50] And we're told in this passage
[1092.50 → 1094.10] that Satan has these flaming arrows
[1094.10 → 1095.06] that he shoots at the church,
[1095.16 → 1096.02] that he shoots at believers,
[1096.02 → 1097.28] that will pierce them.
[1097.60 → 1098.28] And what we're told is
[1098.28 → 1099.52] the thing that protects us,
[1099.52 → 1100.48] that shields us,
[1100.64 → 1101.70] is the shield of faith.
[1102.72 → 1103.50] And what that means is
[1103.50 → 1105.04] it is actually believing in Jesus,
[1105.38 → 1106.86] it is putting our trust in Jesus,
[1106.92 → 1108.74] and remaining close to Jesus
[1108.74 → 1109.74] that protects us
[1109.74 → 1111.04] from those fiery arrows.
[1111.16 → 1112.14] And you probably know this
[1112.14 → 1113.26] in your own experience.
[1113.88 → 1115.82] The more closely you walk with Jesus,
[1116.40 → 1117.42] you sense his protection
[1117.42 → 1118.16] over your life.
[1118.56 → 1119.46] You are not deceived
[1119.46 → 1120.62] by the lies of society
[1120.62 → 1121.80] or Satan around you.
[1123.74 → 1124.56] Fourthly, there is,
[1124.66 → 1125.10] or fifthly,
[1125.16 → 1125.78] there is the helmet
[1125.78 → 1127.02] of salvation.
[1127.02 → 1127.14] salvation.
[1128.58 → 1129.90] We're protected by God
[1129.90 → 1132.04] because we're saved.
[1133.00 → 1133.74] And there's some really
[1133.74 → 1134.56] powerful stuff here,
[1134.64 → 1135.28] especially if you think
[1135.28 → 1135.90] of church history
[1135.90 → 1137.02] and all the different ways
[1137.02 → 1138.18] that believers were attacked,
[1139.14 → 1139.74] the way that Christians
[1139.74 → 1140.34] were martyred.
[1140.94 → 1141.96] And there is this deep hope
[1141.96 → 1142.86] that could not be shaken
[1142.86 → 1143.34] out of them,
[1143.40 → 1144.48] that could not be executed
[1144.48 → 1144.90] out of them,
[1144.90 → 1145.72] and the hope was that
[1145.72 → 1147.46] Jesus Christ rose from the dead,
[1147.64 → 1149.36] and he gave his salvation to us,
[1149.38 → 1150.58] and even death itself
[1150.58 → 1151.70] will not keep us down.
[1151.80 → 1152.66] We will join Jesus
[1152.66 → 1153.60] in his resurrection.
[1154.08 → 1155.30] We experience the salvation
[1155.30 → 1156.30] of our king.
[1157.98 → 1158.80] And then finally,
[1159.48 → 1160.78] believers hold the sword
[1160.78 → 1161.56] of the spirit,
[1162.28 → 1163.78] which is the word of God.
[1164.88 → 1165.74] And notice, by the way,
[1165.78 → 1167.22] there is only one item
[1167.22 → 1168.54] mentioned in all these six,
[1168.60 → 1169.22] that is the weapon
[1169.22 → 1169.90] of the offence.
[1170.24 → 1171.06] All these things,
[1171.12 → 1171.76] the armour of God
[1171.76 → 1172.36] are protective,
[1172.66 → 1174.02] that God protects us
[1174.02 → 1174.90] from the work of Satan.
[1175.18 → 1176.04] This final one
[1176.04 → 1176.70] is the sword,
[1176.80 → 1177.56] and I'm just so,
[1177.78 → 1179.38] I'm intrigued by the fact
[1179.38 → 1180.18] that the sword
[1180.18 → 1181.18] is the word of God,
[1181.82 → 1183.64] the revealed will of God.
[1183.64 → 1184.84] As Pastor Jonathan mentioned,
[1184.96 → 1186.08] it's the scriptures.
[1187.02 → 1188.58] And I think this actually
[1188.58 → 1189.78] ties a number of things together,
[1189.78 → 1190.36] because when we're
[1190.36 → 1190.98] in the scriptures,
[1191.32 → 1193.48] we're reminded of truth.
[1194.20 → 1195.16] When we're in the scriptures,
[1195.28 → 1196.38] we're reminded of that
[1196.38 → 1197.40] we have been saved
[1197.40 → 1198.14] through the work of Christ.
[1198.22 → 1198.94] When we're in the scriptures,
[1199.10 → 1199.94] we're nurtured
[1199.94 → 1201.30] in the gospel of peace.
[1201.84 → 1202.96] And when we're in the scriptures,
[1203.48 → 1205.00] we have the ability to battle.
[1206.66 → 1207.56] Don't forget
[1207.56 → 1208.88] that when Jesus was tempted
[1208.88 → 1209.50] by Satan,
[1210.04 → 1210.80] Satan came with some
[1210.80 → 1211.56] of the most clever,
[1211.98 → 1212.94] little lies,
[1212.94 → 1213.74] and Jesus' way
[1213.74 → 1214.48] of battling back
[1214.48 → 1214.96] was what?
[1215.92 → 1216.86] Quoting the scriptures.
[1217.68 → 1218.48] Reminding Satan
[1218.48 → 1219.84] of the truth of the world,
[1219.96 → 1220.86] the truth of who he was,
[1221.08 → 1222.50] the truth of whom the church is.
[1222.82 → 1224.00] And if that's true for Jesus,
[1224.98 → 1226.70] surely it's also true for us.
[1227.24 → 1227.98] That the best way
[1227.98 → 1229.16] we stand against the lies
[1229.16 → 1229.56] of Satan
[1229.56 → 1230.66] is grounding ourselves
[1230.66 → 1231.36] in the true story
[1231.36 → 1231.80] of the world,
[1231.86 → 1232.36] and that is
[1232.36 → 1233.66] the revealed will of God
[1233.66 → 1234.18] in the scripture.
[1236.98 → 1238.18] Did you notice how
[1238.18 → 1239.68] Paul finishes this passage?
[1239.68 → 1243.46] Verse 18,
[1243.98 → 1245.86] And pray in the Spirit
[1245.86 → 1247.36] on all occasions
[1247.36 → 1249.42] with all kinds of requests.
[1249.98 → 1251.32] Make them known to God.
[1252.50 → 1253.28] Isn't it interesting
[1253.28 → 1254.30] that the final word
[1254.30 → 1256.22] for Paul is prayed
[1256.22 → 1258.04] all the time.
[1258.16 → 1259.56] Bring whatever your requests
[1259.56 → 1260.56] are to God.
[1261.38 → 1262.40] And I think we just need
[1262.40 → 1262.98] to name that.
[1263.14 → 1264.00] Like, God is ready
[1264.00 → 1265.72] to resource us,
[1265.90 → 1266.42] equip us,
[1266.48 → 1267.18] and strengthen us
[1267.18 → 1267.90] at all moments,
[1267.96 → 1268.70] at all time,
[1268.70 → 1269.74] even in the middle of the night
[1269.74 → 1270.32] as you struggle,
[1270.58 → 1271.86] he is ready to equip you
[1271.86 → 1273.28] to face the temptation
[1273.28 → 1274.02] that comes your way.
[1274.58 → 1275.50] He is not bothered
[1275.50 → 1276.46] by the requests.
[1276.74 → 1277.66] He is not too busy
[1277.66 → 1278.38] for the requests.
[1278.80 → 1280.14] None of them are too small
[1280.14 → 1280.66] for him.
[1281.40 → 1282.24] I think some of the most
[1282.24 → 1283.12] beautiful prayers
[1283.12 → 1284.44] often come from children.
[1284.90 → 1285.74] Because children don't have
[1285.74 → 1286.26] this sense of like,
[1286.34 → 1287.02] ah, I don't know
[1287.02 → 1287.86] if this is important enough.
[1287.98 → 1288.94] They just pray it.
[1289.40 → 1290.64] They pray what we call trivial,
[1290.74 → 1291.88] but children have this ability
[1291.88 → 1292.36] to say, okay,
[1292.54 → 1293.44] if God's my Father,
[1293.50 → 1294.22] I'm going to ask Him
[1294.22 → 1294.82] for these things,
[1294.98 → 1295.94] and a generous Father
[1295.94 → 1296.46] that God is
[1296.46 → 1298.34] will provide these things.
[1298.70 → 1301.64] all the requests
[1301.64 → 1303.00] on all occasions,
[1303.50 → 1304.64] and God delights
[1304.64 → 1305.28] in equipping
[1305.28 → 1306.16] and strengthening
[1306.16 → 1307.02] and giving us
[1307.02 → 1308.18] all that we need
[1308.18 → 1310.56] to take our stand.
[1311.64 → 1312.48] Praise the Lord.
[1313.66 → 1314.80] The Father we serve
[1314.80 → 1315.98] is a Father who sent Jesus
[1315.98 → 1317.16] to defeat the enemy,
[1317.70 → 1318.46] and the Jesus
[1318.46 → 1319.88] who is now reigning on high
[1319.88 → 1321.16] has given us the spirit
[1321.16 → 1322.92] to resist His works
[1322.92 → 1325.82] in all their fashions.
[1325.82 → 1327.08] whether it's a personal
[1327.08 → 1328.06] demonic attack,
[1328.28 → 1329.68] or it's a structural sin
[1329.68 → 1330.56] that's become normalized
[1330.56 → 1332.10] and celebrated in our culture.
[1332.40 → 1333.38] All the equipment
[1333.38 → 1335.42] is available for us to wear.
[1335.50 → 1336.42] Do you believe this, church?
[1338.24 → 1339.14] In some sense,
[1339.20 → 1340.40] the main question I have
[1340.40 → 1341.28] as we've been working
[1341.28 → 1342.32] our way through this series
[1342.32 → 1342.84] so far
[1342.84 → 1343.98] and focusing on Satan
[1343.98 → 1344.62] is this.
[1345.68 → 1346.70] Do you believe
[1346.70 → 1347.74] that spiritual warfare
[1347.74 → 1348.32] is real?
[1348.32 → 1351.64] Is God opening your eyes
[1351.64 → 1353.08] to the very real battle
[1353.08 → 1354.44] we live in day after day
[1354.44 → 1354.92] at work,
[1354.98 → 1355.34] at home,
[1355.40 → 1355.78] at school,
[1355.88 → 1356.64] in the ordinary
[1356.64 → 1358.36] routines of our life?
[1359.48 → 1360.54] Because I'll be honest with you,
[1360.58 → 1361.54] the prayer that I have,
[1361.58 → 1362.28] and I know this is not
[1362.28 → 1362.88] just my prayer,
[1363.22 → 1364.12] is that as we work
[1364.12 → 1364.84] through this series,
[1365.56 → 1367.16] God would open our eyes
[1367.16 → 1369.28] that some of the blinders
[1369.28 → 1370.38] we have by growing up
[1370.38 → 1371.04] in our society,
[1371.36 → 1372.10] some of the ignorance
[1372.10 → 1373.32] we have about the real
[1373.32 → 1374.30] tactics of Satan
[1374.30 → 1375.30] and the powers of evil
[1375.30 → 1376.88] would be able to be seen
[1376.88 → 1377.62] by the church,
[1377.62 → 1378.70] and that we take
[1378.70 → 1379.42] all the armour
[1379.42 → 1380.22] that God gives us,
[1380.54 → 1381.06] wear it,
[1381.30 → 1382.16] and then experience
[1382.16 → 1383.16] the joy
[1383.16 → 1385.10] of resisting Satan's temptation,
[1385.52 → 1386.72] experiencing the joy
[1386.72 → 1387.66] of living in the light,
[1387.94 → 1388.94] experiencing the joy
[1388.94 → 1389.66] of the power
[1389.66 → 1390.64] of the Holy Spirit
[1390.64 → 1391.62] in our church
[1391.62 → 1392.30] in real time.
[1393.32 → 1394.20] That's the good news
[1394.20 → 1395.04] of Ephesians 6.
[1395.96 → 1396.82] The forces of evil
[1396.82 → 1397.34] are real,
[1397.46 → 1398.00] they're dangerous,
[1398.20 → 1399.02] we don't mess with them,
[1399.14 → 1400.32] but we have everything
[1400.32 → 1401.38] we need
[1401.38 → 1402.90] to fight them
[1402.90 → 1403.48] in the power
[1403.48 → 1404.06] of the Spirit.
[1405.10 → 1405.94] Praise be to Jesus
[1405.94 → 1407.20] who defeated
[1407.20 → 1407.88] our enemies.
[1408.52 → 1409.32] Praise be to Jesus
[1409.32 → 1409.94] who gives us
[1409.94 → 1410.88] the power of the Spirit
[1410.88 → 1411.96] that enables us
[1411.96 → 1412.90] to resist temptation
[1412.90 → 1414.32] and live in the light.
[1415.36 → 1416.22] Let's pray together.
[1423.90 → 1425.22] Father, would you wake us up
[1425.22 → 1426.32] from our spiritual slumber?
[1428.14 → 1429.44] Would you open our eyes
[1429.44 → 1429.92] to the ways
[1429.92 → 1430.58] that we're blind,
[1431.18 → 1431.96] to the battle
[1431.96 → 1432.78] that is around us,
[1432.86 → 1433.18] the battle
[1433.18 → 1434.22] that is within us?
[1435.60 → 1436.46] And we pray, Lord,
[1436.50 → 1436.98] that we would not
[1436.98 → 1437.88] be filled with fear
[1437.88 → 1438.84] at the reality
[1438.84 → 1439.50] of the powers
[1439.50 → 1440.54] and the principalities,
[1441.08 → 1442.40] but that we'd be filled
[1442.40 → 1443.16] with confidence
[1443.16 → 1443.98] that we fight
[1443.98 → 1444.70] in your strength.
[1445.92 → 1446.90] Lord, whatever it is
[1446.90 → 1447.50] that we face
[1447.50 → 1448.46] in our lives now,
[1448.64 → 1449.54] would you meet us
[1449.54 → 1450.16] in our need?
[1451.46 → 1452.40] Would you strengthen
[1452.40 → 1453.36] and equip us?
[1454.22 → 1455.06] Would you meet us
[1455.06 → 1455.58] in the moments
[1455.58 → 1456.16] of failure,
[1457.16 → 1458.40] the moments of shame,
[1459.12 → 1459.92] those things
[1459.92 → 1460.50] that trip us up
[1460.50 → 1461.28] every day, Lord,
[1461.36 → 1462.86] equip us in those places?
[1463.18 → 1465.96] We boldly pray, Lord,
[1466.00 → 1467.46] that you would fill us
[1467.46 → 1468.58] with the life
[1468.58 → 1469.54] of your Holy Spirit
[1469.54 → 1471.62] so that we would live
[1471.62 → 1472.44] in your love.
[1472.88 → 1473.44] We pray this
[1473.44 → 1474.14] in Christ's name.
[1474.88 → 1475.10] Amen.
[1477.60 → 1478.94] You have no rival.
[1479.80 → 1480.80] You have no equal.
[1480.98 → 1482.08] Now and forever,
[1482.24 → 1483.34] God, you reign.
[1483.68 → 1484.98] What a powerful name it is.
[1485.04 → 1485.58] Would you stand
[1485.58 → 1486.28] and sing with me?
[1486.38 → 1487.20] What a beautiful name.
[1487.20 → 1492.60] You were the word
[1492.60 → 1494.92] at the beginning
[1494.92 → 1498.58] One with God
[1498.58 → 1502.94] The Lord most like
[1502.94 → 1503.70] Amen.
[1503.70 → 1504.22] Amen.
[1504.22 → 1504.54] Amen.
[1504.54 → 1504.70] Amen.
[1505.12 → 1505.18] Amen.
[1505.54 → 1505.62] Amen.
