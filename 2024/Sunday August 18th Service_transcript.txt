[0.00 --> 6.76]  Well, good morning, everyone.
[7.40 --> 9.14]  It's a gift to be in worship together.
[9.84 --> 14.68]  And as Brad mentioned, we're going to continue our sermon series on the hard sayings of Jesus.
[15.06 --> 20.78]  And if you've been following this series, you're probably noticing that the passages that we've selected are hard for different reasons.
[21.36 --> 25.64]  Some passages of Jesus are hard because it's language we don't get.
[25.76 --> 27.64]  It's a context we're removed from.
[27.64 --> 34.26]  And other times it's hard because Jesus is just challenging for how we understand discipleship and following him.
[34.74 --> 38.48]  And this morning we're going to look at a passage that's difficult almost for two reasons.
[38.62 --> 43.26]  One, it's how we understand and read the Old Testament in light of Jesus, which is a big topic.
[43.42 --> 46.62]  And two, it touches on what it means to be righteous and righteousness.
[47.52 --> 50.92]  And so I'm going to do a little more teaching, I think, in this service than usual.
[50.92 --> 52.02]  But I will say this.
[52.02 --> 59.68]  I'm hoping, and my prayer is, as we look at this passage, that we gain understanding about how to read God's Word.
[59.90 --> 65.72]  And if you're new to the faith or you're new to our church, I'm hoping that you'll be able to pick up on what does it mean to hold the Scriptures
[65.72 --> 69.18]  and read them as God's Word, even the Old Testament, in light of Jesus.
[69.18 --> 74.02]  So if you have your Bible, and I do encourage everyone to bring their own, that is a good practice,
[74.26 --> 76.08]  turn with me to Matthew chapter 5.
[76.48 --> 80.48]  We're going to read verses 17 to 20 on the fulfillment of the law.
[80.48 --> 85.70]  Jesus says to us,
[85.70 --> 90.68]  Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.
[91.40 --> 94.56]  I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.
[95.46 --> 102.44]  Truly, I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen,
[102.82 --> 107.70]  will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
[107.70 --> 114.70]  Anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven.
[115.08 --> 120.22]  But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
[120.98 --> 126.34]  For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and teachers of the law,
[126.72 --> 130.52]  you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[130.82 --> 131.98]  This is God's Word.
[131.98 --> 141.80]  Well, whenever an election season comes around, I find myself always intrigued by the rhetoric of politicians.
[142.82 --> 146.56]  And we've got one coming around in the States, as you probably know, and next year one in Canada.
[147.14 --> 152.38]  And just generally speaking, I find it's the same narrative every time elections come around.
[152.44 --> 156.98]  The people, the party that's in power, will emphasize all the good decisions they've made,
[156.98 --> 163.36]  the stability of governance, and they will say, we're not there yet, but trust us to keep going in this trajectory.
[164.30 --> 168.76]  And then the party that wants the power and the leader who wants that position of authority will say,
[168.90 --> 170.70]  that party is a mess.
[171.06 --> 174.22]  All their policies are awful, and everything's got to change.
[174.62 --> 176.48]  And if you vote for me, change is coming.
[177.26 --> 182.18]  And if the people aren't happy with how things are going in their city or their town or in their country,
[182.18 --> 185.32]  they will vote in that new leader to get that change.
[185.94 --> 187.90]  And usually what happens, and this is not healthy,
[188.24 --> 192.80]  they then attach to that politician or that leader their hopes and dreams, right?
[193.00 --> 194.56]  That person's going to fix everything.
[194.68 --> 196.60]  They're going to solve health care and all the rest.
[197.00 --> 203.20]  And they put expectations on that leader that are absolutely impossible for them to actually follow through on.
[203.30 --> 207.64]  And that's why, I don't know if you remember this, but when Barack Obama entered into office years ago,
[207.64 --> 212.44]  he said in an interview, contrary to popular opinion, I was not born in a manger.
[213.36 --> 216.74]  Because they were just heaping on him these huge expectations for change,
[216.80 --> 218.92]  which he never was able to accomplish.
[220.40 --> 223.30]  Something of this is happening with Jesus in our passage.
[223.58 --> 226.20]  You see, Jesus is fairly new onto the scene.
[226.38 --> 228.64]  He's teaching, he's healing, he's casting out demons.
[228.88 --> 230.88]  He's making a name for himself.
[231.70 --> 236.86]  People are noticing this new prophet, teacher, healer, and they are enamored by him.
[236.86 --> 242.20]  And the Jewish people, they see Jesus as this representation of change, which is true.
[242.52 --> 243.04]  That's coming.
[244.16 --> 248.18]  But they then attach to Jesus these hopes and dreams because they're being oppressed by Rome.
[248.28 --> 249.16]  Very important detail.
[249.60 --> 250.76]  They have lost their rights.
[250.86 --> 251.84]  They have lost their land.
[251.94 --> 254.62]  They have this oppressive ruling power over top of them.
[254.88 --> 259.84]  And they see Jesus as this possible revolutionary who's going to bring that change.
[260.26 --> 263.60]  They attach to him this desire for change, right?
[263.60 --> 268.48]  Out with the old, in with the new, new revolutionary leader who's going to do something for us.
[269.70 --> 271.50]  And then Jesus comes onto the scene.
[272.40 --> 273.94]  And he starts talking about himself.
[274.24 --> 276.10]  And he knows they're missing the mark.
[276.60 --> 281.50]  And you can tell he knows they're missing the mark because the first thing he says in the Sermon on the Mount,
[281.58 --> 283.22]  really where he talks about himself is,
[283.88 --> 287.56]  Do not think that I have come, right?
[287.56 --> 293.94]  But that's Jesus' way of saying, I know that you see me, and I know that you misunderstand my purpose,
[294.40 --> 298.04]  my mission, and what I've come to accomplish for my world and for my people.
[298.96 --> 304.46]  And one of the things that seems evident from our passage that they're hoping or thinking Jesus will bring
[304.46 --> 307.84]  is a change to how they understand the Old Testament law and prophets.
[307.84 --> 314.04]  And so Jesus says to them, I have not come to abolish the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them.
[314.56 --> 318.64]  And it seems to be that people are hoping, well, there's this new prophet, there's this new leader,
[318.76 --> 320.26]  he's bringing revolutionary further.
[320.66 --> 325.58]  We don't need anymore this old teaching, these old laws, these old prophetic words.
[325.78 --> 327.58]  We have Jesus now, right?
[327.82 --> 329.74]  In with the new, out with the old.
[330.44 --> 332.02]  And these are the words Jesus says to them.
[332.04 --> 333.10]  I'll read it in verse 17.
[333.10 --> 338.42]  He says, I have not come to abolish the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them.
[339.42 --> 343.98]  Truly, I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, the least stroke of a pen
[343.98 --> 347.92]  will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
[349.12 --> 351.94]  And we do well to pause here and say, what does Jesus mean?
[352.46 --> 354.12]  In fact, one scholar writes about this verse.
[354.22 --> 359.20]  He says, this is one of the most important verses in the Bible about how to read the Old Testament.
[359.98 --> 360.94]  And here's my summary.
[360.94 --> 365.42]  If some of what I say later is a bit confusing, my summary of this passage is this.
[366.06 --> 371.60]  Jesus is saying, I am not abolishing the teaching and the instruction of the Old Testament.
[372.38 --> 375.26]  I'm accomplishing what it set out to do.
[375.80 --> 379.40]  I'm not putting away with and disregarding the words of the prophets.
[379.90 --> 384.28]  I'm fulfilling what they've all been speaking about.
[385.14 --> 386.68]  And in short, and I'll say this again,
[386.68 --> 395.24]  the law and the prophets were given in the Old Testament to form a people who loved God and loved their neighbor.
[396.06 --> 397.98]  And it never accomplished that because of sin.
[398.08 --> 405.56]  And then Jesus comes and says, I have been sent to accomplish what the law could not do or the prophets could not do.
[405.64 --> 408.26]  By the power of God, I will do it through the cross.
[408.78 --> 409.46]  Does that make sense?
[409.46 --> 416.30]  What the law and the prophets could not do, Jesus would now accomplish and fulfill through his life, death, and resurrection.
[416.30 --> 426.54]  Ever since Jesus' time, many people, many Christian leaders, have tried to do away with the Old Testament.
[426.70 --> 427.34]  Did you know this?
[427.96 --> 431.22]  In the second century already, there's a Christian leader by the name of Marcion.
[431.86 --> 434.70]  And he set out on this task of rewriting the Bible.
[434.80 --> 438.14]  And it's never a good thing, by the way, when an individual at any point in history says,
[438.22 --> 438.96]  you know what I'm going to do?
[439.10 --> 440.30]  I'm going to rewrite the Bible.
[440.48 --> 441.32]  That's a red flag.
[441.32 --> 445.80]  And what he wanted to do is create a version of just the New Testament, no Old Testament,
[445.94 --> 448.74]  and then eliminate all the references to the Old Testament.
[448.82 --> 450.06]  Because we don't need that anymore, right?
[450.08 --> 451.00]  That's the old stuff.
[451.20 --> 452.20]  We have Jesus now.
[452.40 --> 455.40]  And he ended up with a very, very thin Bible.
[455.92 --> 462.62]  Because if you know the New Testament, it is loaded with scriptural references and allusions to the Old Testament.
[463.34 --> 467.60]  In fact, I want to put up on a screen here an image that was put together by a researcher.
[467.70 --> 468.66]  Has anyone seen this, by the way?
[468.66 --> 472.40]  It kind of made its rounds on social media a couple years ago.
[473.00 --> 477.36]  But what you need to know is on the bottom, it represents all the 66 books of the Bible.
[477.58 --> 479.18]  From Genesis all the way to Revelation.
[479.30 --> 481.62]  Those are all the Bible verses, all passages.
[482.12 --> 487.64]  And all those little rings on the top are the references between the Old and the New Testament.
[488.92 --> 493.88]  And just marvel with me how many references there are.
[493.88 --> 495.32]  In fact, I'll give you the exact number.
[495.44 --> 501.26]  It's 63,779 times the Bible weaves itself together.
[502.20 --> 506.70]  And the researcher who did this work stood back after it was all said and done and said,
[506.86 --> 507.94]  this is marvelous.
[508.64 --> 513.00]  Like, if you ever want to see a picture that shows how this is not just a human book,
[513.08 --> 516.28]  but it's put together by the defined authority of God, this is it.
[516.28 --> 523.56]  Like, the coherence and the interweaving and the beautiful coherence of the whole story points to God saying,
[523.78 --> 525.16]  this is the true story of the whole world.
[525.60 --> 530.56]  This is my living word, divinely inspired by the Spirit, trustworthy and true.
[530.98 --> 531.72]  That's the Bible.
[532.70 --> 538.62]  But to the point of our passage, it also shows us very well how you can't just get the middle and that on
[538.62 --> 540.68]  without all the stuff that comes before it, right?
[541.22 --> 543.86]  The New Testament depends on the Old Testament.
[543.86 --> 548.20]  It's the story leading up to and making sense of why Jesus came.
[548.54 --> 551.96]  You can't just lop it off in the middle and get rid of everything that came in the beginning.
[553.18 --> 554.36]  And I'll add this.
[555.28 --> 562.98]  Jesus himself had a very high view and love for the Old Testament, right?
[563.04 --> 565.82]  When Jesus is tempted by the devil, what does he respond to the devil with?
[566.38 --> 567.02]  The Scriptures.
[567.02 --> 574.52]  When Jesus is in agony on the cross and he's giving up his life for the world, what's the words that come out of his mouth?
[575.08 --> 575.82]  The Psalms.
[576.38 --> 579.50]  Psalm 22, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[579.84 --> 581.24]  Jesus loved the word.
[581.94 --> 583.10]  He loved the Old Testament.
[583.20 --> 586.66]  In fact, in 2 Timothy, when it talks about all Scripture being God-breathed,
[586.90 --> 591.04]  the Scripture they're talking about in that passage is the Old Testament story.
[591.04 --> 594.76]  These Scriptures are God's gift to us.
[595.20 --> 597.32]  The law is God's gift to us.
[597.42 --> 599.44]  The prophets are God's gift to us.
[599.50 --> 601.86]  And Jesus says, we do not do away with them.
[602.50 --> 604.78]  I've been sent to fulfill them.
[606.42 --> 611.70]  And on the heels of saying he's come to fulfill and accomplish them, he gives a warning, doesn't he?
[612.32 --> 616.46]  Let me read for us in verse 19 the warning he gives, especially to teachers and leaders.
[616.46 --> 625.08]  Anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven.
[625.48 --> 631.34]  But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
[632.14 --> 633.96]  You know, that's a pretty strong warning, isn't it?
[634.50 --> 639.78]  If we feel like, hey, we can just kind of cherry pick the verses we like that speak to us and do away with the others
[639.78 --> 643.12]  or keep the New Testament and get rid of the old, Jesus says, watch out.
[643.12 --> 651.18]  You will be called least in the kingdom of heaven if you do not receive my word in its wholeness for your instruction and for your formation.
[651.94 --> 656.70]  And I also want to add, it's not impressive to Jesus for us just to know the Scriptures.
[657.34 --> 660.18]  Maybe to have a few words memorized, something on the fridge.
[660.60 --> 661.98]  What matters to Jesus is what?
[662.78 --> 664.92]  Putting these words into practice.
[666.10 --> 671.12]  Living them in our ordinary lives such that they give life to us and those who are around us.
[671.12 --> 672.40]  We practice them.
[673.12 --> 679.06]  So now I want to, with your permission, walk into the weeds of this passage.
[679.20 --> 683.04]  So there is, I'm not going to get into all of it, but there's a lot of debate about what this passage means.
[683.40 --> 686.86]  And I kind of got lost in some of the complexity, but I need to name some of it.
[686.92 --> 692.74]  Because if you read the Old Testament, you think, okay, how then do we read the Old Testament in light of it being fulfilled in Jesus?
[692.88 --> 693.46]  What changes?
[693.66 --> 694.22]  What doesn't?
[694.50 --> 696.24]  And we know that there are changes.
[696.58 --> 700.44]  One very specific example is food laws, right?
[700.44 --> 705.50]  There's a lot of restrictions if you read Leviticus about meat and what meat you can eat and what meat you cannot eat.
[705.80 --> 708.10]  And then you go fast forward to Acts chapter 15.
[708.50 --> 712.72]  And Peter's on the roof and he has this vision of a blanket coming down with all these animals.
[712.86 --> 714.98]  And God basically says, you can eat them now.
[715.10 --> 718.02]  And all of us who love bacon say, yes, Lord, thank you.
[718.26 --> 720.16]  Thank you so much for Acts chapter 15.
[720.46 --> 722.54]  We will receive that bacon with gratitude.
[722.54 --> 731.56]  But to add one more layer to it, one of the strange things that people have noticed is Jesus says, I've not come to abolish the law.
[731.66 --> 732.50]  I've come to fulfill it.
[732.54 --> 735.06]  But what does Jesus get accused of all the time in his ministry?
[736.56 --> 737.72]  Breaking the law, right?
[738.42 --> 740.44]  Pharisees come up to Jesus and like, hey, wait a minute.
[740.70 --> 741.68]  You just did this.
[741.78 --> 743.34]  You're breaking the law.
[743.56 --> 744.62]  And so what's going on here?
[745.08 --> 749.40]  And I'm going to do my best to summarize a lot of different scholarly material.
[749.40 --> 752.24]  And if it doesn't make sense, come up to me and we can talk after the service.
[753.04 --> 755.58]  Because there's a lot of history behind what's going on with the law.
[755.74 --> 759.26]  So number one, here's what's going to make sense of this passage.
[760.12 --> 763.82]  Pharisees at the time, they were the teachers of the religious law, the Jewish leaders.
[764.38 --> 766.00]  They had a long oral tradition.
[766.14 --> 768.26]  Remember, the Bible came out of an oral tradition.
[768.62 --> 771.44]  And what happened over time is they had laws that made sense of laws.
[771.50 --> 773.60]  And they sort of stacked laws on top of those laws.
[773.78 --> 776.14]  And then all these laws sort of got bound together.
[776.26 --> 778.52]  And many of them were not in the Old Testament law.
[778.52 --> 784.38]  They were sort of these Pharisaic laws that they added to help people keep the law in the Bible.
[784.78 --> 786.76]  And Jesus had no problem breaking them.
[787.34 --> 788.90]  Healing on the Sabbath is a great example.
[789.00 --> 791.28]  They thought healing was work, shouldn't work on the Sabbath.
[791.56 --> 795.62]  And Jesus is like, I'm going to heal on the Sabbath because the law is about loving our neighbors.
[797.18 --> 802.88]  Secondly, oftentimes, not universally, but oftentimes as the Pharisees would teach the law,
[802.96 --> 806.22]  it became about behaviors rather than the heart.
[806.22 --> 813.60]  It became about not doing certain activities, which still matters, rather than dealing with the desires that lead us down destructive paths.
[813.96 --> 817.16]  It's externals rather than internals, if that makes any sense.
[817.92 --> 820.24]  And then finally, and I'm not going to touch too much on this today,
[820.70 --> 826.98]  the Pharisees often used the law as a way of separating themselves from society, which makes some sense, right?
[827.00 --> 827.54]  They're distinctive.
[827.98 --> 830.62]  But then that turned into a hatred towards their neighbors.
[830.62 --> 834.00]  So the laws were twisted in all sorts of ways.
[834.12 --> 836.14]  One, there's traditions that got built in as laws.
[836.48 --> 838.62]  Secondly, it became about behavior and not motives.
[838.98 --> 843.32]  And thirdly, it became about separating from and then hating society around them.
[843.62 --> 848.34]  And you can understand a little bit of where they're coming from when you realize they're being oppressed by their Roman neighbors.
[848.34 --> 854.20]  And so now we get Jesus saying, I've come to fulfill the law.
[855.02 --> 857.12]  And I want to just help us understand that image.
[857.22 --> 859.58]  That image is really one of filling up.
[859.92 --> 868.56]  Or Jesus saying, I've come to draw out the truest and deepest intention of the laws and the prophecies that God gave in the Old Testament.
[869.36 --> 869.82]  Is that helpful?
[869.82 --> 872.60]  They were given, and then people were not able to obey them.
[872.64 --> 876.80]  And Jesus is like, I'm going to show you the fullest intention of what those laws are about.
[877.10 --> 879.02]  They are not about externals.
[879.84 --> 881.04]  They're not about traditions.
[881.68 --> 882.74]  They're not about segregation.
[883.60 --> 886.92]  They are about loving God and loving neighbor.
[887.46 --> 889.70]  That's what the laws in the Old Testament were given for.
[889.76 --> 891.18]  And just a bit of a sidebar.
[891.76 --> 893.56]  I can't get into too many details on this.
[893.56 --> 903.26]  But you need to know that behind the laws that God gave is always a desire to have people to be in loving relationship with God and loving relationship with each other.
[903.52 --> 905.58]  The Ten Commandments, maybe it's easy to do that.
[905.62 --> 909.48]  But let me give you some really intriguing examples, or one in particular.
[909.88 --> 912.56]  There's a lot of very contextual case laws.
[913.26 --> 918.28]  If you read through Exodus and Deuteronomy and Leviticus, there's a lot of really peculiar laws.
[918.34 --> 919.10]  And maybe you've read them.
[919.44 --> 920.40]  One of them is this.
[920.40 --> 925.34]  The laws do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.
[926.80 --> 928.00]  How's that going for you, by the way?
[928.78 --> 929.96]  You avoided that?
[930.08 --> 930.64]  Good job.
[931.34 --> 934.66]  The reason that law was given, totally removed from our culture, right?
[934.70 --> 937.38]  It's for Israel as they live among the Canaanites.
[937.68 --> 943.52]  And the reason is God cares for the well-being of animals, even when they're being killed.
[944.08 --> 947.48]  He doesn't want it boiled to death like some other people would do.
[947.48 --> 951.64]  And he says, I want to show some provision for and the care for animals.
[951.80 --> 952.76]  That's in God's law.
[953.16 --> 956.76]  And there's lots of other laws about how you build buildings so people don't fall off the roof.
[957.00 --> 958.08]  Laws about caring for the poor.
[958.44 --> 960.64]  Leaving food in your field so the poor would be fed.
[961.04 --> 961.64]  Tons of laws.
[961.80 --> 968.32]  All of them, behind them, even the obscure weird ones for us today, are caring for neighbor and love of God.
[968.32 --> 976.08]  And I encourage you, as you read the Old Testament, find out why the heart of God is showing up or how it's showing up, even in the obscure laws.
[977.06 --> 985.26]  But maybe the best verse to help us understand all the Old Testament law and prophets is Jesus' summary of the law in Matthew 22,
[985.80 --> 988.64]  where you've got all these Pharisees teaching all these things about the law.
[988.74 --> 989.78]  And what does Jesus say?
[989.78 --> 997.50]  The heart of the law is to love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul and mind and strength and to love your neighbor as yourself.
[997.58 --> 1005.96]  And then he adds this, all the law and the prophets hang on these two commands.
[1005.96 --> 1015.20]  The law and the prophets in the Old Testament was always about forming a people who love God and love their neighbor.
[1016.16 --> 1021.44]  And Jesus is coming to draw out what that looks like, show it in his ministry, and then we're going to see in a minute,
[1021.98 --> 1026.04]  enable his followers to live it out and experience life.
[1027.40 --> 1028.52]  Are you with me so far?
[1029.32 --> 1029.86]  All right.
[1029.92 --> 1033.04]  Now we're going to get to the warning.
[1033.04 --> 1037.40]  But actually, before I touch on that, I want to name that in the Sermon on the Mount,
[1037.52 --> 1042.14]  Jesus constantly pushes against the Pharisees in this particular way.
[1042.22 --> 1045.34]  They made the laws about sort of behavior, and he drives to the motive.
[1045.76 --> 1046.98]  And this is a very important part.
[1047.40 --> 1049.12]  Jesus says, you have heard it said, right?
[1049.16 --> 1049.70]  There's these lines.
[1049.80 --> 1051.24]  You have heard it said, but I say to you.
[1051.46 --> 1052.90]  You have heard it said, do not murder.
[1053.02 --> 1053.86]  What does Jesus say?
[1054.82 --> 1056.60]  But I say to you, do not hate your neighbor.
[1057.86 --> 1059.22]  It's not just enough not to murder.
[1059.44 --> 1060.82]  It's dealing with the hate in our hearts.
[1060.82 --> 1062.88]  You have heard it said, do not commit adultery.
[1063.02 --> 1068.04]  But I say to you, deal with the lust in your heart that leads to adultery.
[1068.80 --> 1072.20]  You have heard it said, love your friends and hate your enemies.
[1072.32 --> 1076.68]  But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
[1076.98 --> 1077.90]  Do you see the movement there?
[1078.64 --> 1087.92]  Jesus constantly draws out the deeper meaning of the law, which is the desires of the heart that lead to these behaviors that are destructive.
[1087.92 --> 1094.90]  He's dealing with the deeper movements of the heart, dealing with the love of God and love of neighbor as he gives a sermon on the mount.
[1094.90 --> 1099.32]  And like a good parent, maybe this is a helpful illustration.
[1100.40 --> 1108.72]  A good parent, when they give rules in their home, there's a lot of parents here, you know that when you give rules, you don't do it haphazardly.
[1108.90 --> 1112.72]  And sometimes, you know, you put them in place so they can, you protect your kids and their safety.
[1112.84 --> 1114.38]  You don't want them burning their hand on the stove.
[1114.38 --> 1121.48]  But ultimately, what you want is you want your child to desire to obey those rules because it's good for them, right?
[1121.54 --> 1124.96]  You don't want them just having sort of a legalistic requirement having to obey the rule.
[1125.04 --> 1128.68]  You want them to want to follow because it leads to life.
[1129.02 --> 1132.08]  That's how we understand the laws and the prophets in the Old Testament.
[1133.98 --> 1138.74]  Now let's talk about the second difficult part of this passage, righteousness.
[1139.96 --> 1141.38]  Look at verse 20 with me.
[1141.38 --> 1156.66]  Now, I don't know how you read that, but that's a hard saying, isn't it?
[1157.52 --> 1159.60]  That's a very strong statement.
[1160.46 --> 1165.42]  And you need to know that the Pharisees were like the uber-zealous, uber-righteous people.
[1165.96 --> 1168.74]  Like they were the ones who went far beyond what was required of them.
[1168.74 --> 1171.14]  Their obedience seemed to exceed that of everyone else.
[1171.38 --> 1172.96]  It kind of feels like this.
[1173.38 --> 1177.56]  It's like a teacher of a classroom full of kids saying to all the kids who are average,
[1178.00 --> 1184.40]  hey, you need to be just as smart and keen as Johnny Know-It-All in the front row who's raising his hand and answering every question.
[1184.84 --> 1186.02]  You all need to be like that.
[1186.06 --> 1189.32]  And you're like, okay, well, how could we possibly do that?
[1190.34 --> 1192.46]  But we've got to figure out what Jesus means by righteous.
[1192.46 --> 1198.36]  And we start by recognizing that Jesus helps us understand with another passage in Matthew.
[1199.12 --> 1200.28]  Little sidebar on this.
[1200.66 --> 1206.36]  Whenever there's a confusing passage, the wider context of the gospel and the Bible usually helps us understand it.
[1206.42 --> 1212.86]  In this case, in Matthew 23, Jesus gives some of his harshest words to the Pharisees.
[1212.86 --> 1217.58]  The people who thought they were righteous, who thought they had it together, Jesus just shreds them.
[1218.02 --> 1219.02]  Three things he calls them.
[1219.08 --> 1220.26]  Number one, he calls them blind.
[1221.34 --> 1223.18]  Secondly, listen to this one, he calls them snakes.
[1223.86 --> 1224.66]  Those are fighting words.
[1225.02 --> 1228.78]  Thirdly, perhaps the most pungent, he says, you are like whitewashed tombs.
[1228.78 --> 1236.54]  Now, maybe that doesn't have power in our context today, but think of this, a whitewashed tombs, very clean on the outside, a dead corpse on the inside.
[1237.20 --> 1240.12]  There is a reason why these people started banding together to kill Jesus.
[1240.24 --> 1243.96]  He was not easy on them, and he had some very harsh words for them.
[1244.04 --> 1245.16]  And part of it is this.
[1245.98 --> 1253.46]  He knew that they were preoccupied with sort of adherence to the law, but their hearts were far from him.
[1253.46 --> 1258.94]  He knew that they were preoccupied with behaviors, but their motives, their desires were far from him.
[1259.22 --> 1264.42]  And he knew that they were twisting and abusing the law to segregate and then hate their neighbors who are Romans.
[1264.72 --> 1267.08]  And Jesus says to them, you're missing all of it.
[1267.56 --> 1269.34]  You're missing why the law was given.
[1269.80 --> 1274.92]  All the stuff you're doing is still not what God desires.
[1275.92 --> 1277.78]  He's after the deeper movements of the heart.
[1277.78 --> 1284.00]  He's after obedience that comes from love for God and for neighbor.
[1285.66 --> 1290.18]  And if you're just reading for the Bible for the first time, you'll know that, first of all, Jesus is always relational.
[1291.16 --> 1293.54]  And at the heart of his laws is love.
[1295.36 --> 1300.16]  Now, Gerald Johnson says that one of the central pieces of the Sermon on the Mount is this word righteous.
[1301.02 --> 1303.52]  In the Beatitudes, the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount, God says,
[1303.52 --> 1306.94]  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[1307.78 --> 1311.42]  Blessed are you who are persecuted because of righteousness.
[1311.82 --> 1314.40]  And I don't know what comes to your head when you hear the word righteous.
[1314.62 --> 1317.34]  It has many layers to it in some sense, justice.
[1317.78 --> 1323.66]  But I want to suggest to you the best way to understand it is right relatedness.
[1324.98 --> 1328.20]  Those who are righteous are in right relationship.
[1328.40 --> 1331.00]  And the righteous to Jesus are in right relationship with the Father.
[1331.42 --> 1333.96]  The righteous in Jesus are in right relationship with neighbor.
[1333.96 --> 1336.20]  Right relationship with the non-human creation.
[1336.52 --> 1338.40]  And right relationship with self.
[1339.32 --> 1342.54]  And as Jesus gives the Sermon on the Mount and many other teachings in the Gospel,
[1342.88 --> 1348.18]  He's constantly teaching on what it looks like to be in the right relationship with the Father.
[1348.86 --> 1350.12]  Right relationship with neighbor.
[1350.52 --> 1351.86]  Self and creation.
[1352.50 --> 1354.10]  How to be generous and just.
[1354.20 --> 1355.24]  How to speak truthfully.
[1355.30 --> 1356.22]  How to love our spouse.
[1356.54 --> 1357.16]  Love our kids.
[1357.40 --> 1357.96]  Love our neighbors.
[1358.22 --> 1359.84]  What shalom looks like in community.
[1359.84 --> 1362.80]  He's teaching us this is what righteousness looks like.
[1363.04 --> 1367.50]  More than that, He's showing us with His own life what righteousness looks like.
[1369.04 --> 1374.52]  And if you're curious, you should know that Jesus in many ways in the Sermon on the Mount
[1374.52 --> 1378.28]  is upping the requirement from what the Pharisees even thought.
[1379.22 --> 1381.94]  Jesus is saying, I'm not abolishing the law and starting something new.
[1382.12 --> 1384.28]  I'm actually drawing out the deepest intentions.
[1384.52 --> 1386.94]  And that's the kind of righteousness I want from you.
[1386.94 --> 1389.74]  I want obedience that comes from the heart.
[1390.30 --> 1394.44]  I want love for neighbor that shows up in generosity and justice and all the rest.
[1394.68 --> 1397.64]  And we hear this and we say, okay, Jesus wants us to be more righteous
[1397.64 --> 1400.10]  and He wants us to love Him in our depths.
[1400.18 --> 1402.36]  He wants us to operate out of love for Him and neighbor.
[1402.94 --> 1405.34]  How in the world do we do this?
[1407.94 --> 1410.28]  And now I want to ask you, are you ready for some good news, church?
[1410.28 --> 1418.04]  Because Jesus was sent to make us righteous.
[1419.94 --> 1428.84]  Jesus was sent to put us in right relationship with the Father and neighbor and non-human creation and self.
[1429.58 --> 1433.12]  He knew that righteousness, this right relatedness, we cannot do on our own.
[1433.22 --> 1434.40]  We cannot accomplish this on our own.
[1434.40 --> 1436.68]  We do not have it within ourselves to be righteous.
[1436.80 --> 1441.50]  And Jesus comes to put us back together righteous.
[1443.14 --> 1448.30]  Not only does He show what righteousness looks like in relationship and obedience to the law,
[1448.62 --> 1452.46]  He then does what the law could never do and the prophets could never do.
[1452.54 --> 1457.02]  The laws were good, but the human heart was too wicked and did not want to obey.
[1457.28 --> 1461.52]  The prophets gave wisdom and truth, but our rebellious hearts rejected that.
[1461.52 --> 1467.64]  And now Jesus comes and He says, I'm going to finally deal with the thing that keeps your hearts from obedience.
[1468.10 --> 1471.28]  I'm going to break the power of sin through the cross.
[1472.06 --> 1477.80]  Once and for all, dealing with its power, dealing with its guilt, dealing with its destruction,
[1478.06 --> 1482.06]  I will take that so that you, church, can be righteous.
[1482.78 --> 1484.46]  Back into relationship with the Father.
[1484.98 --> 1486.58]  Back into right relationship with each other.
[1486.96 --> 1490.18]  Back into right relationship with creation and your own selves.
[1490.18 --> 1496.38]  And when Jesus dies on the cross and He says, it is finished, righteousness has come.
[1497.24 --> 1501.76]  Through His resurrection, by His power, righteousness has come.
[1502.72 --> 1504.96]  He comes to make us righteous.
[1505.24 --> 1506.10]  And I love this line.
[1506.16 --> 1507.60]  It comes from a commentary on Matthew.
[1508.02 --> 1512.88]  One writer says, Jesus demands for righteousness flow from His gifts.
[1512.88 --> 1515.84]  The finished work on the cross makes us righteous.
[1515.94 --> 1522.48]  And His power in the resurrection enables us to live in obedience to the good instruction of the Word.
[1525.38 --> 1528.42]  I want to read for us a passage from Ezekiel.
[1529.28 --> 1531.62]  One of those neglected prophets in the Old Testament.
[1531.84 --> 1533.68]  And I want you just to hear these words.
[1533.72 --> 1534.38]  I'm going to read it slowly.
[1534.48 --> 1537.36]  I want you to hear it through the lens of Jesus.
[1537.36 --> 1540.22]  And by the way, that's the best way to read the Old Testament.
[1540.40 --> 1541.86]  You read it through the lens of Jesus.
[1541.98 --> 1542.76]  You know where it's going.
[1542.86 --> 1546.06]  But listen to these beautiful, powerful words.
[1546.06 --> 1550.04]  I will sprinkle clean water on you.
[1551.24 --> 1552.46]  And you will be clean.
[1553.16 --> 1556.94]  I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all your idols.
[1557.86 --> 1562.70]  I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you.
[1563.44 --> 1569.68]  I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
[1569.68 --> 1581.10]  And I will put my spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.
[1581.60 --> 1582.50]  Do you see it?
[1583.32 --> 1584.66]  Do you see what Jesus is doing?
[1585.16 --> 1587.38]  He's not saying I'm abolishing these laws because they're bad.
[1587.42 --> 1588.70]  He's like, no, these laws are good.
[1588.76 --> 1589.60]  The prophets are good.
[1589.76 --> 1596.00]  And I'm going to defeat the power of sin so that you can follow by the power of the spirit
[1596.00 --> 1603.16]  that is at work within us prophesied way before Jesus came in the words of Ezekiel.
[1604.84 --> 1608.36]  And I mean, there's so many things I want to say about this, but maybe I'll just say this.
[1608.74 --> 1611.20]  I've seen what this looks like.
[1611.84 --> 1616.80]  As I pastor in our church and I see people come to faith in Jesus, I see people begin to pray.
[1616.80 --> 1622.32]  I see the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ take hold of ordinary hearts,
[1622.32 --> 1627.74]  parents, parents, and children, old and young, to give them a desire to follow,
[1628.76 --> 1634.42]  a desire to listen, a desire to pick up the Scriptures and say,
[1634.54 --> 1639.74]  Lord, I want to lead a life that follows your instruction.
[1640.56 --> 1647.22]  I want to live in obedience to you because it's a life of love to the Lord
[1647.22 --> 1649.18]  and a life of loving neighbor.
[1649.18 --> 1657.80]  If I haven't emphasized this enough already, the laws that God gives always lead to life.
[1658.32 --> 1663.22]  The instruction that Jesus teaches always leads to blessing.
[1663.76 --> 1667.36]  And as the Spirit moves in our church, it will lead to people who say,
[1667.62 --> 1672.22]  yes, Lord, I want to follow your instruction because it is life.
[1672.22 --> 1681.20]  One of the burdens I have as a pastor for our city, as our country in general deconstructs
[1681.20 --> 1686.14]  any sense of what is normative, that is, rules and laws that are true for everyone,
[1686.50 --> 1689.68]  there is almost a loss of how we are to live.
[1690.10 --> 1692.36]  In fact, many psychologists and philosophers are saying,
[1692.44 --> 1697.18]  we live in this strange time where no one really knows how we're supposed to live.
[1697.18 --> 1701.60]  No one really knows where to turn for true instruction that leads to life.
[1701.68 --> 1705.04]  And I think, what a beautiful moment for the church of Jesus Christ.
[1705.60 --> 1709.36]  What a beautiful moment for us to say, we know the way of life.
[1709.96 --> 1713.12]  And we have the Spirit of the living God who enables us to live it.
[1713.40 --> 1721.60]  And when we do, it shines brightly in a dark culture where people do not know how to live.
[1721.60 --> 1729.36]  Maybe you haven't thought about this much lately, but isn't it a gift that Jesus teaches us how to live?
[1730.38 --> 1733.28]  And isn't it a gift that He says, I'm not just going to teach you and show you,
[1733.40 --> 1736.28]  I'm going to give you my Spirit so you can experience it.
[1737.38 --> 1740.28]  And maybe the to-do list for us this week is simply saying,
[1740.36 --> 1743.98]  Lord, I don't know your Word, but I ask that you give me a love for it.
[1745.32 --> 1747.10]  I'm not very good at following your ways,
[1747.10 --> 1750.94]  but I pray that your Spirit would give me the strength to follow step by step,
[1751.14 --> 1754.02]  the grace when I fail to stand up again and follow in your ways,
[1754.16 --> 1758.74]  so that I experience life and those around me can experience blessing through my obedience.
[1760.62 --> 1765.56]  Jesus has come to draw out the deepest meaning of the law,
[1766.02 --> 1767.92]  which is love of God and love of neighbor.
[1768.06 --> 1770.84]  And He says, because I finished the work on the cross,
[1771.34 --> 1773.50]  you can begin to experience that now.
[1773.50 --> 1779.92]  And not just you, your families, your neighborhoods, and your friends.
[1781.00 --> 1781.82]  Praise be to God.
[1782.68 --> 1783.84]  Let me lead us in prayer.
[1788.56 --> 1790.58]  Father, we praise You for Your Word.
[1791.84 --> 1796.40]  We thank You for the beautiful, divine inspiration of the Scriptures.
[1797.78 --> 1800.82]  And we receive it as a gift again this morning to our lives,
[1800.92 --> 1802.28]  to our families, to our world.
[1802.28 --> 1809.04]  Lord, we thank You that Jesus has accomplished and fulfilled the law and the prophets.
[1810.72 --> 1817.04]  And Lord, we ask that we would experience the renewing power of His resurrection life,
[1817.96 --> 1820.42]  and that this life would lead us to obedience,
[1821.24 --> 1822.38]  and that we would flourish.
[1823.62 --> 1827.56]  Lord, we want to live lives that are full of love for You and love for neighbor.
[1827.66 --> 1829.18]  So would You move in us?
[1829.18 --> 1834.36]  Would You pour Your Spirit on us so that we would display before a watching world
[1834.36 --> 1838.86]  the life that comes from following in Your ways?
[1839.36 --> 1840.90]  We pray this in Christ's name.
[1841.46 --> 1841.68]  Amen.
