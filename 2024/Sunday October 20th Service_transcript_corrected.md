[0.00 → 7.34] Good morning, Hope. This morning, we get to continue our sermon series on reflecting what
[7.34 → 15.00] it means to live for the world, to love the world, but not being of it, right? That's what
[15.00 → 21.94] this contrast community series is all about. We are called to be contrast community of believers
[21.94 → 27.98] standing against the idols of our culture because we are a people redeemed by the grace and love
[27.98 → 34.50] of God. We've looked at the idol of self-elevation, self-sufficiency, and last week greed and
[34.50 → 39.70] entitlement, and these are all the ways opposite to the way of blessing, right? Opposite to the way
[39.70 → 46.58] that God intends for us to live. The result out of idol worshipping and having idols as our masters
[46.58 → 52.52] are terrible masters, but when we worship them as masters, the result out of those are words like
[52.52 → 60.68] anxiety that we talked about, fear, worry, exhaustion. And then today, we get to focus in on injustice
[60.68 → 68.40] as one of the bad fruits out of idol worshipping. And something about justice, you know what I mean?
[68.94 → 74.88] Like, we all have this desire to make something right again. And one way that it reflects in our
[74.88 → 81.82] culture today, in our, yeah, in our generation, I should say, is watching those instant karma videos.
[82.22 → 87.68] You know what I'm talking about? I confess, I spent way too much time on this, so this is
[87.68 → 94.26] an honest confession moment. But those instant karma videos on YouTube or social media, wherever you see
[94.26 → 100.98] memes and stuff. For example, you have like reckless drivers, you know, and they're just being reckless,
[100.98 → 105.34] they're tailgating, or they're causing a havoc on the road, and as soon as they pass a car,
[105.58 → 112.44] they get pulled over by a cop. And you go, yes, satisfaction. And there are countless videos of
[112.44 → 118.88] those, and you get really, really pulled into it. I think it speaks into that sort of instinct that we
[118.88 → 127.22] have, that sort of gut feeling of wanting to set things right, wanting to seek justice. But that's not
[127.22 → 132.10] bad in itself, obviously. We all want justice, right? We're made in the image of God, and that's how we
[132.10 → 141.44] were created. But the problem is, is that we often want just our standard of justice. My own standard of
[141.44 → 146.72] justice, what it looks like, or at least just the group of people that think like me, however we think
[146.72 → 154.40] justice should look like. But as Christians, at the very least, we are called to be humble enough
[154.40 → 161.96] to see and hear others' opinions and ideas, even if they are different. Better yet, especially if
[161.96 → 169.18] they're different, we should be humble enough to hear them out. Because in our culture of self-rule,
[169.56 → 176.18] of defining our own moral standards and what justice even looks like, we as the people of God are called
[176.18 → 184.34] to live under God's rule, under God's standard of justice and love. You know, and to be fair, that's
[184.34 → 190.76] hard to discern many of the times. What is justice? What does God want for us in this situation?
[192.00 → 199.04] But that is our goal, and that is our hope, that is our foundation that we try to live out in our day-to-day
[199.04 → 204.72] lives. And it requires, again, that humility piece, to know we don't have all the answers,
[204.72 → 210.94] to judge between right and wrong, that belongs in God's hands. And so with that in mind,
[211.58 → 217.50] turn with me to the Gospel of Mark this morning, and we get to see the heart of the Father expressed
[217.50 → 224.18] through Jesus' passion at the temple. Mark 11, verse 15, we start reading,
[224.64 → 229.78] On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying
[229.78 → 235.16] and selling there in the temple. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of
[235.16 → 240.40] those selling doves, and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.
[240.98 → 248.40] And as he taught them, he said, Is it not written, My house, God's house, will be called a house of
[248.40 → 255.98] prayer for all nations, but you have made it into den of robbers. So the chief priests and the teachers of
[255.98 → 261.30] the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole
[261.30 → 269.62] crowd was amazed at his teaching. This is the word of the Lord. So in the clearing of the temple courts
[269.62 → 275.96] that we just read, Jesus displays righteous anger. That's how we commonly put it, righteous anger.
[276.74 → 283.08] What he does here is that he reveals to us the heart of the Father. The heart of the Father, you can see
[283.08 → 287.66] and trace it all throughout the Old Testament, not just the New Testament, through Jesus, right?
[287.84 → 296.22] Pulling from Micah. What God wants for his people are to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly
[296.22 → 303.22] with God himself, right? That's our calling. That's what God wants for his people. Again, living under his
[303.22 → 312.66] rule and his ultimate standard of justice and love. And one stark example of human rule versus God's rule
[312.66 → 317.90] that we can trace throughout history, I was reminded of this. So reflecting on justice and what it means.
[318.36 → 322.88] And then Moon and I watched the movie. Actually, we didn't finish it because it was just, it was a bad
[322.88 → 331.88] movie. It's a Korean movie, but it was based on a true, based on true events of how Koreans were
[331.88 → 339.28] identified by their status. And we still are to some point. But the main character of the story is the
[339.28 → 346.50] child of a slave. And so he was born into his status, and he had no choice but to live as a slave.
[346.62 → 352.22] And it's a story of how he's trying to fight that, fight the injustice, right? Too much gore fighting it,
[352.30 → 357.52] but that's what he's trying to fight, the injustice that was happening. And then, as I was doing research
[357.52 → 364.06] for the sermon, I read how even the Greek philosopher Aristotle, he taught that some people were just
[364.06 → 371.68] simply born to be slaves. That's their fate. That's their destiny. We see that same thing in the caste
[371.68 → 377.04] system in India, right? That's what it's based on. If you're born into a certain caste, a class,
[377.20 → 383.38] that's where you belong. Don't try to get out of it. You were born that way. And unfortunately,
[383.70 → 389.60] that's the part of, that's the human logic that's behind us justifying slave training,
[389.60 → 396.20] like we heard about today. But even in a big part of Western history, right? That's the logic.
[396.84 → 401.34] Some people are just born to be slaves, so it's fair for us to just treat them that way.
[402.62 → 407.94] That's the injustice. That's a blatant example of human rule versus God's rule.
[409.18 → 414.92] Now, you can say that that's maybe a little bit easy, that's easier to discern than some of the other
[414.92 → 421.32] injustices that are happening. Because we don't have anything like racism or poverty or wars and
[421.32 → 429.40] violence or broken policies and systems today, right? At least not in Canada. Now, we all know that
[429.40 → 435.76] that's not true. No. And as the pastor and writer Tim Keller, Timothy Keller says, reflecting on the
[435.76 → 442.06] reality of injustice in the world, he says that the default mode of the human heart is to label some
[442.06 → 449.06] people as, quote-unquote, barbarians. Just like in the past, it's the same thing today, just expressed
[449.06 → 455.38] in different ways. And this, what Tim Keller is trying to speak into, is the sinful nature that the Bible
[455.38 → 463.36] tells us. Sinful nature that we all are affected by. Because at the heart of it, justice is also a
[463.36 → 469.82] relationship issue. That's where it all stems from. That's the sinful nature, as I mentioned. You can see
[469.82 → 473.76] it all the way from the beginning. The first brothers that are mentioned in the Bible, Cain and Abel,
[474.32 → 481.10] it ends up in broken relationship because of sin, because of that tainted heart. And it ends up to
[481.10 → 489.30] the act of injustice to the point of murder. I'm trying to point us to the real problem, because you can
[489.30 → 495.94] treat the symptoms. And we should do all we can to treat the symptoms that come out of our lack of
[495.94 → 503.72] justice. But we do have to talk about the heart of it. What's the actual cause of injustice? Broken
[503.72 → 512.16] relationship. What's the cause of that? Sin. A rebellion against God. Because our God is just. He is a God of
[512.16 → 519.32] justice. And he calls us to do the same. He is a God who is all-loving. And in that way, in the picture of
[519.32 → 527.62] shalom, in perfection, in harmony, that's the way he created the whole world. That's how he created the
[527.62 → 534.06] world. And he called it good. And he said it was very good after he was finished. But when rebellion
[534.06 → 540.44] against his right rule tainted the good world, that justice and love also broke apart. That loving,
[540.60 → 546.48] harmonious relationship between us and God, with ourselves, with each other, and with the rest of
[546.48 → 553.82] creation has broken apart. And I mention this because that's how we want to define justice,
[554.50 → 562.72] based on God's Word. Justice, then, is the restoration of that brokenness. Wherever there is
[562.72 → 570.76] broken relationships, that's where we want to seek justice and harmony again. So right relationship.
[571.76 → 575.52] You know, the biblical word for right relationship is actually righteousness, not justice.
[575.52 → 583.12] But those two words go hand in hand. Justice, mishap, and righteousness, saliva. They are
[583.12 → 590.86] like married words. You can't separate those words in the Bible. So justice is seeking right relationship
[590.86 → 599.04] and vice versa. So that's the good news for us, hope. God is on a mission to restore that justice again,
[599.04 → 606.60] that shalom again. And you know what? The good news is, it's already done. Through the death and
[606.60 → 612.98] resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord, that mission is already completed. The already not yet is what we
[612.98 → 618.82] call the kingdom. Because it's already accomplished by the work of Jesus. And we get to have glimpses in
[618.82 → 626.18] the not yet right now. And so we, as the people redeemed by the grace of the Father, through the
[626.18 → 631.52] self-sacrificial love of the Son, and now through the guidance and equipping of the Holy Spirit,
[631.90 → 640.64] we get the privilege. We get the gift of living justly, of living in God's standard of justice and love.
[640.64 → 648.92] Again, not easy, but that's our hope, and that is our goal. We get to. It's a gift. We get to love
[648.92 → 656.70] and live justly. So in our passage today, that's what Jesus is reflecting. He shows for us the Father's
[656.70 → 663.68] passion and heart for this restoration, for justice. And this fiery display of justice is recorded in all
[663.68 → 669.72] four Gospels. That just tells you that this is very important. All four Gospel accounts record this
[669.72 → 678.10] because where does this event actually happen? It happens in the temple of God, in the house of God,
[678.20 → 684.68] where it's supposed to be the place where the whole world was supposed to be invited in to witness
[684.68 → 693.42] that just kingdom of God, that restoration of shalom. That's the place this injustice happens.
[693.86 → 699.60] That's the biggest of ironies at this point. Quoting two Old Testament prophets, Jesus says,
[699.72 → 707.52] that my house, so God's house will be called a house of prayer for all nations. This is from Isaiah, right?
[707.62 → 712.26] This reflects that vision where all the nations are supposed to flood in and witness to the goodness
[712.26 → 718.98] of God's kingdom. But then this is the exact place where the priests took it and exploited the people
[718.98 → 724.24] who were coming to worship because they have made it, as Jesus says, quoting another prophet Jeremiah,
[724.24 → 730.16] that you have made this house of God for all nations into a den of robbers.
[732.80 → 738.84] Jesus is angry about this injustice happening against, and especially the outsiders, quote-unquote,
[739.08 → 746.06] the Gentiles, the people that did not belong to the chosen people of God. There's more irony to this.
[746.06 → 752.08] And to emphasize this anger, this passion by Jesus, an important contextual detail that we need to go over
[752.08 → 760.06] is found in a few verses before. See, this kind of fiery outburst, this is not on the spot.
[760.70 → 768.22] Jesus premeditates his act of anger and passion here. In Mark, in the chapter that we read, in verse 11,
[768.22 → 774.24] it says that Jesus entered Jerusalem, went into the temple courts, looked around at everything.
[775.90 → 780.08] He could have burst out right there. He could have shown us God's heart right there, but no.
[780.98 → 785.56] But since it was already late, he left, and he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
[786.40 → 790.82] The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, he goes back to the temple courts.
[790.82 → 801.54] So Jesus has already seen all the injustice that's happening. He thinks about it. He premeditates on it.
[801.76 → 807.90] He probably prays on it. And he spends a whole night sleeping on it, thinking about how he's going to show God's heart
[807.90 → 815.08] against the injustice. So you have to ask, what exactly was he so mad about?
[815.08 → 821.38] If you're talking about crimes, you know, you burst out in anger, you know, you get a lighter penalty than if you are,
[821.48 → 826.32] if you premeditate that murder. Jesus is not committing a crime here, but it's that serious.
[827.00 → 832.62] What's he so mad about? What are the actual details of the injustice happening in the temple?
[833.96 → 838.30] Well, you'll see in the picture here, the injustice was happening in the outer courts.
[838.92 → 842.46] This is where we call, where they called it the Gentile courts.
[842.46 → 848.66] And see, the design of the temple is not just for aesthetics. They didn't just make it to look good.
[849.50 → 855.50] The design of the temple reflects the theology behind the thinking, the theological thinking,
[856.14 → 861.30] that God's actual presence lives there in the Holy of Holies, right in the middle of the temple.
[862.20 → 868.22] And because that's where God's presence actually is, if you do not belong to the people of God,
[868.22 → 875.98] you are restricted access, you are restricted proximity to the presence of God, right?
[876.44 → 880.94] Fair enough. They're trying to be obedient to the religious teaching that they grew up with,
[881.06 → 884.04] that is their identity as the people of God.
[884.68 → 891.50] But while trying to keep up with their religious orders and rules, they were missing the heart of it.
[891.50 → 894.50] I desire mercy, not sacrifice.
[895.18 → 899.64] But they were focusing in just on the sacrificial religious order part.
[901.50 → 904.24] On top of that, here's where it gets serious.
[904.64 → 909.90] On top of that, on top of failing to be a blessing for all nations, which is their calling,
[911.16 → 915.52] the priests set up marketplaces in those outer Gentile courts,
[915.52 → 920.32] which was the only place those outsiders had for worship.
[921.50 → 928.30] So scholars estimate that a dove used for the sacrificial offering that they use for the forgiveness of their sins,
[928.74 → 933.46] it would have cost people outside the temple courts just about six cents, they estimate.
[934.30 → 939.24] Inside the temple courts, in those marketplaces, it would have cost them about 75 cents.
[939.94 → 942.14] That's a big jump, yeah? Talk about inflation.
[942.14 → 945.58] And they used temple currency.
[945.88 → 954.40] They had currency exchange places that ensured that you can only buy those sacrificial offerings inside the temple using their currency.
[954.90 → 956.16] So you had to pay up.
[958.08 → 963.50] The priests were ripping off the people who were there to buy their forgiveness,
[963.82 → 967.60] who needed the grace of God and His forgiveness the most.
[967.60 → 973.18] There they exploit them, and they use it for their own profit.
[974.28 → 975.20] And so here's the picture.
[976.24 → 984.78] On the one hand, you have the Son of God Himself, God's actual presence in person, in proximity,
[985.30 → 991.92] eating with those outsiders, eating with those sinners and tax collectors, those deemed unacceptable.
[991.92 → 995.60] He eats and does life with them in proximity.
[996.16 → 1000.42] And then on the other hand, you have priests that were supposed to represent God,
[1000.56 → 1005.60] and they were limiting proximity to God's presence because some people were not worthy.
[1006.98 → 1011.40] And again, on top of that, now from that place of further proximity,
[1011.78 → 1014.26] they exploit them for financial gain.
[1015.22 → 1018.52] That's what Jesus was so mad about.
[1019.00 → 1020.26] That's the heart of God.
[1020.26 → 1024.78] This is not new, unfortunately.
[1025.80 → 1028.56] The people of God, and you trace it throughout the Old Testament,
[1029.08 → 1033.88] as much as their calling to be a blessing is, they failed to live up to that calling.
[1035.18 → 1040.42] They failed because they were looking more at the religion than the heart of the Father.
[1040.88 → 1043.36] Again, I desire mercy, not sacrifice.
[1043.70 → 1047.82] And Jesus uses that same quote when He's talking to the religious elites.
[1047.82 → 1053.44] And that same message is so powerfully expressed through the prophet Amos.
[1053.94 → 1056.06] And God speaks these words through this prophet.
[1056.06 → 1086.04] God says,
[1086.06 → 1088.92] That's the heart of the Father.
[1089.88 → 1092.28] That's what Jesus expresses at the temple.
[1092.28 → 1100.70] Can you now sympathize with Jesus and how He apparently bursts out in emotions?
[1100.70 → 1102.70] Yes, He has emotions.
[1102.70 → 1104.06] Yes, He has emotions.
[1104.06 → 1106.88] He has passion because He has the heart of the Father.
[1107.14 → 1108.10] And He wants to seek.
[1108.36 → 1109.76] He wants to see, I should say.
[1109.98 → 1111.34] He wants to see restoration.
[1111.84 → 1114.98] He wants to see real justice, real righteousness.
[1115.44 → 1116.52] He wants to see shalom.
[1116.52 → 1120.26] And then turn that around.
[1120.26 → 1127.50] Can we see this and be humbled by how close this can and has applied to the church as well?
[1128.34 → 1130.16] This institutional injustice.
[1131.38 → 1133.82] Being the body of Christ, the church,
[1133.82 → 1140.44] we're to be a contrast community that's called by God's grace to reflect His kingdom.
[1140.44 → 1145.78] This is not just religious observances for individual holiness and piety.
[1146.90 → 1154.38] In other words, if our spiritual practices, if our faith does not lead to the margins of society,
[1154.80 → 1159.82] then we are separating what it means to be truly just, to be truly loving.
[1159.82 → 1162.32] And we too often do that, don't we?
[1166.24 → 1167.28] We are blessed.
[1167.46 → 1170.90] We are saved and redeemed by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1171.08 → 1172.16] That is our salvation.
[1172.60 → 1174.36] That is our baptismal identity.
[1174.70 → 1176.32] Yes and an amen all the way.
[1177.10 → 1181.16] But we have to realize that it's always attached to so that.
[1181.46 → 1185.28] We are blessed so that we can be a blessing for others.
[1185.28 → 1190.52] So that we can do the works that God has prepared in advance for us to do.
[1191.06 → 1197.60] And those works that God prepares and His mission that He invites us into includes the work of justice.
[1199.30 → 1203.18] Justice back then, justice now, whatever that looks like in our cities.
[1205.00 → 1207.74] And before getting to the encouraging part,
[1207.80 → 1211.80] because our church is doing so many good things to seek that justice.
[1211.80 → 1217.46] This is not just me being like a prophet and like discouraging everyone for doing such a bad job.
[1217.66 → 1219.26] There are so many things that we are doing.
[1220.16 → 1224.22] But we do have to humbly confess how we come short.
[1224.54 → 1225.88] How we always come short.
[1226.76 → 1228.32] And that's why we lament.
[1231.64 → 1233.22] Look around, you can say.
[1233.86 → 1236.44] You can preach all you want and that's the kingdom of God.
[1236.52 → 1237.48] Yes, that's justice.
[1237.82 → 1238.44] But look around.
[1238.52 → 1240.58] There's still so much brokenness all around.
[1240.58 → 1242.82] There's so much injustice.
[1243.68 → 1245.32] Where is God in all this?
[1246.18 → 1250.34] Where do we even start to reflect God's just kingdom here in our cities?
[1251.14 → 1252.44] That's an honest question.
[1254.08 → 1255.24] So we lament.
[1256.04 → 1259.18] That word just means crying out in full honesty.
[1259.38 → 1261.30] Lord, we want to see more of your kingdom.
[1261.30 → 1270.04] That's why the lament psalms or the lament prayers in the Bible and all throughout church history cry out in anguish.
[1270.36 → 1271.42] And they cry out to God,
[1271.56 → 1272.78] How long, O Lord?
[1273.06 → 1273.96] How long?
[1274.64 → 1277.26] How long until there are no more hungry children?
[1277.64 → 1280.28] Until no more people are being neglected and abused?
[1280.48 → 1283.46] Until wealth and resources are fairly distributed?
[1283.96 → 1287.86] Until there are no more wars or violence and people losing their homes?
[1287.86 → 1290.20] How long we cry out?
[1291.76 → 1294.16] And there's a Greek word that we use in the Bible.
[1294.66 → 1295.82] It's Maranatha.
[1296.30 → 1299.00] And it simply means, come Lord, come quickly.
[1300.18 → 1302.72] Because we want to see full restoration.
[1302.72 → 1306.22] So that's what we pray.
[1307.26 → 1309.06] We want to see the full restoration.
[1309.24 → 1312.26] So we say, Jesus, Maranatha, come quickly.
[1312.50 → 1314.50] That's what the early church always prayed.
[1315.64 → 1318.62] And yet, because Jesus is our hope,
[1319.04 → 1320.70] in the same breath we pray,
[1321.20 → 1324.72] Lord, may we glimpse and reveal your kingdom on earth
[1324.72 → 1327.56] more and more by your guiding and equipping.
[1328.52 → 1330.58] So we hold those two things together.
[1330.58 → 1333.58] Come quickly, Lord Jesus.
[1333.86 → 1334.96] And while we wait,
[1335.84 → 1337.60] reveal your goodness through us.
[1339.10 → 1340.02] Use us.
[1341.66 → 1344.78] And hope, talk about being used by God for his kingdom.
[1345.30 → 1347.26] Our church is blessed with so many people
[1347.26 → 1349.28] that continue to seek God's heart
[1349.28 → 1350.80] and will for our communities.
[1351.76 → 1352.16] Why?
[1352.66 → 1355.08] Because we keep asking this question.
[1355.56 → 1358.18] Where are the pressure points of our city
[1358.18 → 1360.50] that meets the resources of our church?
[1360.82 → 1362.56] That's a great question to keep asking.
[1362.88 → 1365.12] And that's what our leaders keep asking at our church.
[1365.80 → 1368.22] Where are the pressure points of our city
[1368.22 → 1371.52] that meets the resources of our church?
[1373.00 → 1375.78] Whether it's getting involved in Servants Anonymous,
[1376.74 → 1379.36] continuing our work through the Coverdale Community Kitchen,
[1379.72 → 1381.16] getting involved with safe families,
[1381.76 → 1383.30] deacons that meet regularly,
[1383.74 → 1386.10] trying to discern what the needs are in our city,
[1386.10 → 1389.96] hosting a refugee family that we're praying for right now.
[1391.04 → 1393.28] These are the ways that we as a church body
[1393.28 → 1395.30] reflect his kingdom of justice.
[1395.64 → 1397.82] And all of us, on top of that,
[1397.98 → 1400.82] are called individually, day to day in our lives,
[1400.98 → 1403.38] to reflect that same kingdom of justice.
[1404.10 → 1405.72] And one pastor said it this way,
[1406.18 → 1409.70] speaking about living out the justice and mercy like Jesus did.
[1409.70 → 1413.38] He said, proximity is the solution.
[1414.18 → 1414.96] So how do we do it?
[1415.02 → 1417.46] How do we live this out in our day-to-day lives?
[1418.04 → 1419.54] Proximity is the solution.
[1420.36 → 1422.46] It's a relational kind of learning.
[1422.46 → 1426.92] Jesus made room for those that were deemed as unacceptable.
[1427.64 → 1430.64] The restricted proximity that the religious created
[1430.64 → 1434.52] was broken and turned upside down by Jesus at the temple.
[1435.26 → 1438.16] He had real relationships, real friendships,
[1438.48 → 1440.66] not just religious tasks to accomplish.
[1441.82 → 1443.50] He ministered to real people.
[1445.14 → 1449.80] So real justice then looks like having real relationships,
[1450.28 → 1451.92] sitting down with a refugee family,
[1451.92 → 1454.40] hearing and sharing the pain of single parents,
[1454.72 → 1456.16] sharing a meal with the vulnerable,
[1456.60 → 1458.56] sitting with the co-worker or your classmate
[1458.56 → 1459.78] that sits alone all the time.
[1460.62 → 1461.76] Whatever it may be,
[1461.84 → 1463.26] in our little corners of the kingdom,
[1463.52 → 1464.70] we seek shalom.
[1465.10 → 1469.34] We seek the restoration of that restored relationship.
[1472.92 → 1475.24] Against the religious expectation of his day,
[1475.50 → 1479.40] Jesus ate with sinners, tax collectors,
[1479.40 → 1481.94] and the Pharisees pointed their fingers and said,
[1482.62 → 1483.78] why does your rabbi,
[1483.92 → 1487.52] why does Jesus eat with those tax collectors and sinners?
[1488.30 → 1488.68] Why?
[1489.34 → 1492.32] Because Jesus saw people for who they were.
[1493.66 → 1495.18] He saw real people.
[1495.56 → 1496.70] And I love this phrase.
[1497.26 → 1499.50] He loved them to life.
[1500.54 → 1502.08] In real relationships.
[1502.08 → 1505.98] Justice then is a heart issue,
[1506.20 → 1507.62] not a religious issue.
[1509.54 → 1510.86] That's where we start.
[1511.22 → 1514.24] That's living under God's rule
[1514.24 → 1517.06] and his standard of justice and love.
[1518.40 → 1519.64] And I want to end with this story.
[1519.88 → 1521.54] Again, I keep calling it a story.
[1521.80 → 1523.88] I want to end with this historical fact.
[1524.24 → 1525.88] As I was researching for this sermon,
[1525.88 → 1530.16] I read that a church historian
[1530.16 → 1532.68] tracing the spread of the early church,
[1533.32 → 1535.70] one of the most reliable index
[1535.70 → 1538.00] to trace the spread of the early church
[1538.00 → 1541.86] is by tracing the overturning of laws and rules
[1541.86 → 1544.86] against sexual violence against women
[1544.86 → 1545.98] in the Roman Empire.
[1546.50 → 1547.28] Did I say that well?
[1547.66 → 1548.52] Did you follow me?
[1549.06 → 1551.86] When you trace the overturning of sexual violence
[1551.86 → 1553.40] in certain cities and societies
[1553.40 → 1554.64] in the Roman Empire,
[1554.80 → 1557.08] that's where you'll find the church.
[1557.90 → 1558.76] Isn't that beautiful?
[1559.88 → 1561.40] That's real justice.
[1561.74 → 1563.76] That's the glimpse of the kingdom of God
[1563.76 → 1565.32] on earth as it is in heaven
[1565.32 → 1566.42] that we keep talking about.
[1567.66 → 1569.74] In the same way, that's our calling.
[1570.56 → 1574.00] Where do we meet the needs of the city
[1574.00 → 1574.82] with our resources?
[1576.88 → 1579.32] God continues that work today
[1579.32 → 1581.68] and we have the privilege and the gift
[1581.68 → 1583.34] to join in His work
[1583.34 → 1584.10] for His kingdom.
[1584.62 → 1586.22] So I want to end with this psalm.
[1586.84 → 1587.76] The psalmist says,
[1588.10 → 1589.04] and we say it together,
[1589.48 → 1591.46] May the nations praise You, O God.
[1591.86 → 1593.96] Yes, may all the nations praise You.
[1594.30 → 1596.42] Let the whole world sing for joy
[1596.42 → 1599.80] because You govern the nations with justice
[1599.80 → 1602.26] and guide the people of the whole world.
[1603.08 → 1604.06] That is our God.
[1604.68 → 1605.70] That is our hope.
[1606.12 → 1606.58] Let's pray.
[1606.58 → 1606.60] Let's pray.
[1613.34 → 1614.08] Loving Father,
[1614.20 → 1615.50] we thank You so much
[1615.50 → 1618.40] that You are a God of justice.
[1619.46 → 1619.98] Lord,
[1620.30 → 1622.54] the world is in Your hands
[1622.54 → 1625.70] and we just ask that You forgive us
[1625.70 → 1627.42] for pretending like it is in ours.
[1629.22 → 1630.82] Lord, I pray that You continue
[1630.82 → 1632.22] to gift us with humility
[1632.22 → 1634.10] so that we may seek
[1634.10 → 1636.52] and be sensitive to Your guiding.
[1636.52 → 1638.64] However,
[1638.64 → 1639.92] however Your Spirit guides us
[1639.92 → 1641.02] in our individual lives
[1641.02 → 1644.52] and our gathered lives as a church,
[1645.24 → 1646.28] Lord, use us
[1646.28 → 1648.42] and may we reflect more and more
[1648.42 → 1649.86] of Your kingdom of justice
[1649.86 → 1651.04] and shalom here.
[1651.04 → 1654.40] I pray, Lord,
[1654.52 → 1655.90] we continue to pray.
[1656.32 → 1657.06] Come quickly.
[1657.68 → 1659.04] We want to see full shalom
[1659.04 → 1660.48] and at the same time, Lord,
[1660.66 → 1663.26] we thank You that You are still ruling,
[1663.60 → 1665.14] that You are still on Your throne.
[1666.30 → 1667.74] May we find our hope
[1667.74 → 1669.00] and comfort and peace
[1669.00 → 1670.32] in that reality,
[1670.78 → 1671.64] in that truth.
[1672.78 → 1675.16] We thank You that You use us.
[1675.58 → 1677.04] Thank You for Your Holy Spirit
[1677.04 → 1678.96] that You do not leave us alone
[1678.96 → 1680.16] on our own powers.
[1680.16 → 1682.10] Thank You for guiding
[1682.10 → 1684.30] and equipping us in Your love
[1684.30 → 1686.14] and may this love overflow
[1686.14 → 1687.52] onto our neighbours
[1687.52 → 1688.30] and our communities
[1688.30 → 1688.96] and our cities.
[1689.62 → 1690.56] We thank You for this.
[1690.88 → 1692.18] Be glorified, Lord.
[1692.66 → 1693.70] In Jesus' name we pray.
[1694.52 → 1694.80] Amen.
[1694.80 → 1694.94] Amen.
