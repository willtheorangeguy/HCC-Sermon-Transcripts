[0.00 → 8.82] Good morning. It's good to be with you. Been away for a few weeks, so nice to be back.
[10.08 → 15.10] Last week, Pastor Dave started off our series on the massive book of Jude,
[16.46 → 22.08] a three-part series on a one-page book. So that's kind of interesting, isn't it?
[22.20 → 28.38] Most people going through Scripture might even miss it, but it's quite a book. It's written
[28.38 → 35.90] by Jude, who's a brother of Jesus. And I'm going to remind you a few things that Pastor Dave shared
[35.90 → 42.16] last week, and then I'll get into the next part here. As I said, it's a complicated book,
[42.52 → 47.40] lots of Old Testament references that we're going to deal with today, lots of images, a bunch of
[47.40 → 54.62] strange, weird metaphors. Yet Jude spoke to the people of his day, and he speaks to us now as
[54.62 → 62.64] well where we live. The book is basically saying that truth matters, especially for leaders.
[65.12 → 70.78] Jude saw some issues in the church in terms of false teachers, then he says it this way,
[71.02 → 80.02] who have slipped into the church. And he gives two accusations. The first one is this. These people
[80.02 → 87.56] are ungodly, perverting the gospel. They're saying you can do whatever you want. And the second
[87.56 → 93.86] accusation is they reduced Jesus, reduced his lordship over life. Those are the two accusations
[93.86 → 101.14] he's dealing with. They're not living in the way of Jesus, and their behaviour is contrary to what Jesus
[101.14 → 109.52] said. He says they're immoral. They're saying Jesus isn't fully human, or Jesus isn't authoritative.
[109.52 → 119.12] So Jude says, and Pastor Dave talked about this last week, contend for the gospel. Stand firm in the
[119.12 → 127.48] gospel. Fight for truth in a gracious way. Because with some leaders not holding on to the truth,
[127.78 → 134.54] the church is in danger of being divided. And because these false teachers live contrary to the
[134.54 → 143.22] gospel, they must be challenged, or they will harm the church. He's saying character is critical,
[143.76 → 151.46] so be serious about the teachings that we hold and the way we live. So there's a bit of a summary.
[152.02 → 158.00] So now let's jump into it. I get the big middle piece. Jonathan will finish it off next week here.
[158.00 → 166.28] Jude 3.19. I'll cover a little bit of what Dave did last week. Dear friends, he writes, it'll be up on
[166.28 → 172.06] the screen here. Although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, that's what he
[172.06 → 178.68] wanted to talk about, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for
[178.68 → 185.52] all entrusted to God's holy people. We're supposed to protect it. For certain individuals whose
[185.52 → 192.06] condemnation was written about long ago has secretly slipped in among you, they are ungodly
[192.06 → 197.54] people. They're not going to sound like it, but they are ungodly people who pervert the grace of our Lord
[197.54 → 204.62] into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only sovereign and Lord. You see the accusations.
[205.32 → 210.90] Though you already know this, I want to remind you that the Lord at one time delivered his people out of
[210.90 → 215.56] Egypt. They would be well familiar with those stories. But later destroyed those who did not
[215.56 → 221.38] believe. And the angels who did not keep their position of authority but abandoned their proper
[221.38 → 227.52] dwelling, these he has kept in darkness bound with everlasting change for the judgment on the great
[227.52 → 233.60] day. Similarly, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual
[233.60 → 239.78] immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
[239.78 → 245.32] In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams, these ungodly people pollute their own
[245.32 → 251.42] bodies, reject authority, and heap abuse on celestial beings. But even the archangel Michael,
[251.80 → 256.80] when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him
[256.80 → 263.68] for slander, but said, the Lord rebuke you. Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand,
[263.98 → 268.72] and the very things they do understand by instinct, as irrational animals do, will destroy them.
[268.72 → 275.86] Woe to them! They've taken the way of Cain. They have rushed for the prophet in Balaam's era.
[276.12 → 281.38] They have been destroyed in Torah's rebellion. These people are blemishes at your love feast,
[281.46 → 287.06] your gatherings, eating with you without the slightest qualm. Shepherds who feed only themselves.
[287.42 → 292.60] They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind. Autumn trees without fruit, uprooted,
[292.60 → 298.82] twice dead. There are wild waves of the sea foaming up their shame, wandering stars for whom the blackest
[298.82 → 304.76] darkness has been reserved forever. Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them.
[305.10 → 309.24] See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge everyone
[309.24 → 314.26] and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they've committed in their ungodliness.
[314.98 → 320.72] And all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him. These people are grumblers and
[320.72 → 326.12] fault-finders. They follow their own evil desires. They boast about themselves and flatter others for
[326.12 → 332.16] their own advantage. But dear friends, remember what the apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
[332.16 → 338.46] They said to you, in the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.
[339.00 → 346.20] These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the spirit.
[348.40 → 357.40] Wow! That's a lot. And all of that is clear as mud, right? It's all clear as day.
[357.40 → 362.36] I imagine you have some questions. It's such a calming passage.
[364.68 → 369.96] I've not preached on Jude before, so this was good for me. I had a lot of questions too.
[370.82 → 376.06] And I came away after doing some study and praying and thinking about this and listening to other
[376.06 → 381.42] people talk about it. I came to see how rich and beautiful this passage is and how relevant it is
[381.42 → 387.30] for us today. So I'm going to walk you through it. Jude is writing, and here's who he says he's
[387.30 → 396.26] writing to, to those called, loved, and kept in Christ. Called, loved, and kept in Christ.
[397.06 → 403.42] That's who he's writing to. Those people then and you now. And he's saying, because that's a profound
[403.42 → 412.58] thing to say, he's saying that's worth protecting. That's worth contending for. A little aside here,
[412.58 → 418.18] but one writer said, contending and contentious are not the same thing. And I like that. You know,
[418.26 → 423.30] we contend for the gospel. We don't have to be contentious about it. So let's be cautious with
[423.30 → 428.44] that. But let's contend for the gospel. Defend the truth in love so they, whoever they may be,
[428.68 → 436.34] see Jesus at work. Now, let me read to you once again verse 4. For certain individuals whose
[436.34 → 441.22] condemnation was written about long ago has secretly slipped in among you. Ungodly people,
[441.46 → 447.02] they pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ as Lord and
[447.02 → 454.32] Saviour. Written about long ago is a bit of a confusing thing in a way. He's not talking about
[454.32 → 459.50] before their actions they were condemned, which is the way some people might want to read it. It was by
[459.50 → 464.70] their actions and their behaviours that they were condemned. Jude is not saying they were condemned
[464.70 → 470.28] before they became false teachers, but because they became false teachers. And the phrase long
[470.28 → 478.18] ago here says, false teachers have been around throughout history. Nothing is new here. Rebellion
[478.18 → 485.18] is ancient. It exists right from the start of Scripture. We think of Adam and Eve. And these,
[485.64 → 493.40] let's be clear here, these are not well-meaning leaders actually struggling to find God's truth.
[494.70 → 500.18] That's not what we're talking about here. These people have already made up their minds according
[500.18 → 509.00] to themselves. And they've slipped in the church to mess with everyone else. I personally have great
[509.00 → 513.42] patience with those who wrestle with the Scripture and trying to find the truth of it. But I have
[513.42 → 520.42] little patience with those who arrogantly teach that which is contrary to the Bible. I don't have a whole
[520.42 → 525.84] lot of patience for that. I don't mind talking, but there's something, there's an arrogance there that is harmful.
[526.50 → 534.74] And then as Jude says here, and they refuse the truth. Here's the truth. No, no, I'm doing what I'm doing.
[535.24 → 541.12] And notice Jude never names those who are the corrupt leaders. He doesn't even really get into any of the issues.
[541.52 → 547.54] It's about the way that some leaders are living. Their bad theology is revealed by their moral compromises.
[547.54 → 556.12] Jesus says it this way in Matthew 7. He says, watch out for false prophets. So he's doing the same thing
[556.12 → 561.54] what Judas is doing. Watch out for false prophets. What are they like? Well, they come in sheep's clothing,
[561.66 → 568.10] right? They look innocent. But inwardly, they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit, you'll recognize them.
[568.34 → 573.30] See what's coming out of their lives. That's how you'll recognize if they're lying to you or not.
[573.30 → 581.78] One scholar said, as Christians, what we live is the most reliable indicator of what we actually believe.
[582.98 → 591.26] And that's true. What you live out is where your heart really is. And this isn't, by the way, about being
[591.26 → 598.38] perfect in our living. It's about honest living, about repentance, about humility, and striving in the
[598.38 → 604.86] spirit to know what scripture says and to be like Christ. What were these leaders living like?
[605.26 → 610.22] Well, Jesus says, they lived a moral life. They denied Jesus' sovereignty and lordship.
[612.46 → 620.22] When you look at verses 14 through 16, he says, they're ungodly without God, even if they claim God is
[620.22 → 625.98] with them. They have defiant words. They're grumblers. Furthermore, they're fault-finders. Furthermore, they're following their own
[625.98 → 629.50] evil desires, boasting, flattering to take advantage of people.
[634.14 → 640.78] Ungodly. With all this, with all what they say, they don't know God because it shows that in their
[640.78 → 645.74] lives. It's not in them. It's not displayed in their living, but in their lack of repentance.
[645.74 → 657.54] If you ever meet a Christian leader who isn't repentant, you are, found somebody you ought not to
[657.54 → 664.28] follow. There's no humility in them. They say things, there's no fruit. They say things like this,
[664.64 → 670.30] because of grace, right, grace is so big, because of grace, I can do whatever I want.
[670.30 → 679.96] What? And there's this twisted logic going on there. If you ask me, you know, can you come back
[679.96 → 691.26] from sin because of grace? Yes. If you repent, if you see sin for what it is, yeah, then grace is
[691.26 → 695.36] there for you. But if you say, I can do whatever I want, it doesn't matter because grace is big,
[695.36 → 703.22] you missed the point of grace completely. There's no humility. So they deny Jesus by their unwillingness
[703.22 → 712.06] to submit to his lordship. Because Jesus is my Lord, I know my sin.
[715.88 → 722.52] And when I know my sin, I can name my sin, and then I can lay it before Jesus, and I can be forgiven.
[722.52 → 732.28] You don't have any leaders that are sinless except Jesus. But we need repentant and humble leaders.
[732.72 → 737.80] And then when I repent of my sin, then I long to live like Jesus. And these false leaders,
[737.96 → 743.40] they want control. There's no surrender in them, no seeing their own sin.
[743.40 → 757.86] I remember my dad, you know, sometimes praying, and when we prayed, sometimes somebody said,
[757.92 → 762.78] oh, Lord, forgive us our sins. And sometimes he'd say something like, well, name them.
[764.26 → 769.66] Right? You know, because sometimes we can just use a big blanket statement, right? Oh, forgive all my sins.
[769.66 → 774.58] Well, can you name them. No, I can't. Because I haven't given it much thought, right? I'm not
[774.58 → 781.20] wrestling with the Lord trying to understand my own brokenness so that God can heal me of that
[781.20 → 793.74] brokenness. Our culture, as all cultures are, is a formation machine. Our culture says things like
[793.74 → 805.60] this, you do you. You define right and wrong. And Christians can be shaped by that kind of thinking.
[805.92 → 812.98] And Jude says, that's a lie, and faithful leaders know it because they follow Jesus versus following
[812.98 → 829.54] their own evil desires. And we say, Jesus controls me. But these false leaders say, well, say things that
[829.54 → 835.00] can sound quite appealing to us. They can say, well, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. I can follow Jesus
[835.00 → 841.90] and have sex with whoever I want? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Great! I can follow Jesus and use all my wealth
[841.90 → 848.50] in whatever selfish ways I like? Wonderful! I can follow Jesus on my own terms, just, you know, and do
[848.50 → 856.46] whatever I want? Wonderful! And Jude says, there's nothing new here. It's part of the sin story right
[856.46 → 863.76] from the start. Early on in Genesis, right? Adam and Eve, the eating from the tree. What's the big selling
[863.76 → 871.40] point Satan uses? You will be like God. Hey, that sounds great! Because I'd make a great God.
[871.90 → 880.46] It's a lie! And that's at the heart of selfishness and self-centredness. It's a lie, and it always leads
[880.46 → 886.06] to destruction. And without surrender to Jesus' Lordship, I am choosing that which eventually destroys.
[888.46 → 891.90] Versus life in Jesus. Life that is about flourishing.
[891.90 → 901.50] And I need to yield to Him again and again and again and again and again.
[901.50 → 909.42] I take back my will too often, and I need to surrender it again and again.
[910.94 → 916.34] In John 6, verse 68, Jesus is with a crowd of people. He says a bunch of stuff that people don't
[916.34 → 921.02] like. A bunch of people wander away. They don't want anything to do with them anymore. Jesus says to
[921.02 → 926.56] the disciples, so you guys leave in two. And Simon Peter says this, one of my favourite verses really.
[926.56 → 933.12] So I'm in Peter, and I'm saying, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of life, of eternal life. You
[933.12 → 939.60] have those words. There are no other words out there that are eternal life. Only you have them.
[940.32 → 946.88] You alone bring life. And this isn't new. And Jude looks at a bunch of stories to illustrate this
[946.88 → 952.64] for the audience of his day, and then for us too. But I think some of the examples are probably not very
[952.64 → 958.00] clear to some of you, so I'm going to try to help you through it. In verse 5 through 7, Jude uses the
[958.00 → 965.76] example of the people in the Exodus. God frees them from slavery. Yet, quite a bit of time forward,
[965.76 → 970.96] there's a bunch of people who rebel against Moses and God, and they don't receive the promised land.
[970.96 → 975.76] In fact, they die in the desert. And earlier on, this is what they had said in Exodus 14.
[977.28 → 982.24] These who opposed. They said, didn't we say to you in Egypt, leave us alone, let us serve the
[982.24 → 985.52] Egyptians. It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than die in the desert.
[986.32 → 988.00] And they get their wish.
[991.84 → 1000.00] They make their own plans. They refuse to follow God. And they ironically die in the desert, as they said.
[1001.36 → 1008.72] Second example Jude references is the story in Genesis 6. It's a strange story. And he uses a
[1008.72 → 1015.52] book that was of their time there called First Enoch to help understand it. And he talks about the sons of God.
[1016.56 → 1022.56] And some scholars think those are angels having sex with the daughters of men, with women.
[1024.56 → 1031.36] But it is an example then of these angels, these beings rebelling against God. And in the story,
[1031.36 → 1036.16] God judges them according to their rebellion and their actions. So that's Jude's second example.
[1036.72 → 1042.96] And Jude is saying, that's how this goes. And the third example is that of Sodom and Gomorrah,
[1042.96 → 1050.64] which is kind of a famous phrase, Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham is looking for his nephew Lot,
[1050.64 → 1055.52] who's living in Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham has come to get him out of there. He's with a couple of angels.
[1055.52 → 1062.24] And the men of Sodom and Gomorrah all gather, and they're seeking to have sex with the angels who are with Lot.
[1063.12 → 1069.60] And that's that lovely story. Right? And we read that in Genesis 19. Basically, God is saying,
[1069.92 → 1076.80] invites a change in behaviour, because those behaviours harm us. And he's trying to pull out.
[1077.36 → 1081.20] I think of the story, you know, where Abraham is talking to God about Sodom and Gomorrah,
[1081.20 → 1084.88] and it's going to be destroyed. And he says, well, if there's only 50 good people, are you going to destroy it? No.
[1084.88 → 1088.72] 40 good people, no. And God wants to save the city.
[1092.72 → 1100.72] But they refuse. God is always leading toward life. And that offer gets refused over and over again.
[1101.20 → 1105.60] We know better than you do, God, and we'll do whatever we want.
[1109.28 → 1110.56] You will be like God.
[1110.56 → 1110.64] God.
[1113.44 → 1121.04] Only God brings life. And when we refuse life, we by default choose death and darkness.
[1121.68 → 1128.72] Sin leads to death. Romans 6.23 says it rather well. For the wages of sin is death.
[1129.84 → 1135.28] Death in all kinds of ways. Not just dropping dead, but living a dead life. But the gift of God is
[1135.28 → 1140.88] eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. So either we embrace God, your will be done, and we embrace life.
[1140.88 → 1147.44] Or you say, my will be done, and we embrace death, and we embrace brokenness. Those are the options.
[1150.00 → 1156.88] We either trust the maker of life, or we trust ourselves, and then wonder later why it's going so poorly.
[1156.88 → 1164.32] Jude is saying, trust God, and don't let false teachers mislead you.
[1165.44 → 1169.12] And then in verses 8 through 10, Jude gives us another weird sounding story,
[1169.12 → 1176.08] with another reference out of their day to a book called The Testament of Moses, a first century
[1176.08 → 1182.00] retelling of Moses' final days. You can read about that in Deuteronomy 30 through 34. But in this story,
[1182.00 → 1187.52] an angel, Michael, defends Moses against the accusations of the devil after Moses has died.
[1189.04 → 1193.92] And says, and the angel says, leave the final judgment to God alone. It's not up to us.
[1193.92 → 1204.40] It says, corrupt teachers are driven by their thoughts and their appetites, and therefore will not yield to God,
[1205.20 → 1208.56] the God who alone judges.
[1208.56 → 1218.08] And uses this phrase, woe to them.
[1221.12 → 1221.92] That word woe.
[1223.76 → 1226.56] Woe is trouble. So yet, troubles to them.
[1228.72 → 1234.80] The way Sid has taken it is, woe means like, whoa, stop. So I'm going with that just because I like it.
[1234.80 → 1239.68] No. Scripture is talking about trouble to them. But I think, I think, whoa, stop. You know,
[1239.68 → 1243.44] stop listening to lies. That's what he's saying to those people who are following false teachers.
[1243.44 → 1249.92] But I think he's also saying to the false teachers, stop giving lies, because it's destroying you too.
[1254.64 → 1262.96] Woe. Woe to them who live like, and then he goes on, Kay and Balaam and Torah, because all of us know who they are.
[1262.96 → 1269.60] No, and I know a lot of you probably don't. I had to remind myself some of whom these were too.
[1270.56 → 1273.44] There are more examples of rebellion that led people astray.
[1274.72 → 1278.24] Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 1533.
[1279.76 → 1284.96] He said to those folks, don't be misled. Notice where the onus is. Don't be misled.
[1284.96 → 1287.84] He said, bad company corrupts good character.
[1291.52 → 1299.70] A little aside to young people. Young people, this is why, you know, your parents will sometimes, you know, take a look at your friends and make sure that they're a trustworthy kind of friends.
[1299.70 → 1311.04] I remember a pastor talking about this once where, saying, you know, if somebody were down here, and they were going to pull me, I'm going to pull them up, or they're going to pull me down.
[1311.56 → 1317.30] You know, who's going to win that pull? And it's going to be them because it's easy to pull people down. It's harder to pull them up.
[1318.98 → 1319.14] Right?
[1320.82 → 1321.14] Yeah.
[1322.26 → 1323.66] Paul's teachers are out there.
[1323.66 → 1327.72] And Cain, he said, they're like Cain.
[1327.98 → 1329.90] Well, we all know about Cain and Abel.
[1330.32 → 1331.86] Cain murdered his brother out of jealousy.
[1332.16 → 1333.14] But then what did he do?
[1333.26 → 1333.88] Did he repent?
[1334.06 → 1334.86] No, no, he didn't.
[1335.10 → 1339.14] He built a city and a culture that was dedicated to self.
[1341.96 → 1343.22] Balaam, who's that guy?
[1343.54 → 1347.40] He was a sorcerer hired by a king to curse Israel.
[1347.62 → 1348.28] They were going to have a war.
[1348.60 → 1349.80] God stopped him with a donkey.
[1349.80 → 1350.82] That's a whole other story.
[1350.82 → 1358.26] But he advises this king then, Balaam advises the king, another way to destroy Israel through idolatry and sexual corruption.
[1359.00 → 1361.52] He continues to work against God.
[1362.36 → 1364.72] The God who stopped him with a talking donkey.
[1364.84 → 1366.76] And he thinks that that wasn't enough of a sign.
[1366.84 → 1367.42] I don't know.
[1370.92 → 1371.40] Torah.
[1371.92 → 1372.68] He's a Levite.
[1372.76 → 1375.42] They were set aside to take care of the temple and serve God.
[1375.42 → 1379.42] But he rebelled against Moses, who was God's chosen leader.
[1379.42 → 1381.66] And it ends up in the death of many of the Israelites.
[1382.24 → 1385.60] And Jude is saying, corrupt teachers are after what?
[1386.02 → 1390.86] They're after wealth, position, power, sex, all while wearing the mask of self-righteousness.
[1393.84 → 1396.06] And they'll lead you to death.
[1396.06 → 1403.06] And we see the fruit or lack thereof of these false teachers.
[1403.94 → 1413.02] And then in verse 12, 13, to hit it home a little bit more, Jude uses some metaphors to help us see the chaos that the false leaders left in their wake.
[1413.50 → 1415.54] All these images that he uses are found in Scripture.
[1416.26 → 1418.32] As I said, he's driving the point home.
[1418.98 → 1421.18] He's saying, they're like selfish shepherds.
[1421.72 → 1421.84] Right?
[1421.90 → 1423.02] Shepherds are supposed to take care of the sheep.
[1423.36 → 1424.54] Well, they're like selfish shepherds.
[1424.54 → 1425.56] They're not worth following.
[1425.66 → 1427.48] They're only looking out for themselves.
[1427.60 → 1428.96] They don't have your interests at heart.
[1429.50 → 1431.48] They're like empty clouds with nothing to give.
[1431.90 → 1435.62] They're like offering, they offer no fruit.
[1436.28 → 1437.28] They're dead trees.
[1437.64 → 1438.78] They're like waves of chaos.
[1439.08 → 1440.90] They're like wandering stars leading you nowhere.
[1440.90 → 1449.78] And then finally we get down to 14 and 19 where we read about it.
[1449.78 → 1456.40] And then in the final days, God is going to come, and he is going to deal with all who mislead.
[1456.40 → 1466.06] When I see God's anger at its deepest, I see especially toward leaders who mislead.
[1466.92 → 1474.14] That's why Jesus said anybody who misleads a child, it would be better a big stone to get tied around their neck, and they get chucked into the ocean than mislead a kid.
[1474.42 → 1475.70] I mean, this is serious business.
[1478.84 → 1479.30] Right?
[1479.30 → 1483.18] He will judge that.
[1483.18 → 1489.56] The Gospel of John, John 10, 10, Jesus says it this way.
[1490.04 → 1493.94] He says, the thief, the false teacher comes only to do what?
[1494.06 → 1496.08] To steal and kill and destroy.
[1496.58 → 1501.46] And Jesus says, I have come that they may have life and life to the full.
[1502.96 → 1506.08] The ungodly, Jude says, don't have the Holy Spirit.
[1506.34 → 1507.58] They aren't guided by God.
[1507.58 → 1509.34] They only lead to death and division.
[1511.90 → 1513.46] And that's as far as I'm going to go.
[1513.58 → 1516.84] Because otherwise next week, Jonathan is going to blame me for taking his stuff.
[1518.08 → 1521.04] So, let me summarize.
[1522.76 → 1525.82] Who we follow matters.
[1528.86 → 1530.52] Who we follow matters.
[1531.22 → 1532.94] And we're hearing all kinds of voices there.
[1533.32 → 1534.60] Who are you following?
[1534.94 → 1535.98] And where are they leading?
[1535.98 → 1538.86] False teachers are all around.
[1539.28 → 1542.42] And we are responsible to look at who's influencing us.
[1542.64 → 1543.86] Who are you listening to?
[1544.06 → 1545.08] What are you watching?
[1545.36 → 1547.16] What podcasts are you listening to?
[1547.22 → 1551.80] And I'm not saying you can't listen to anything that isn't Christian per se.
[1552.08 → 1554.26] But you better be watching with your eyes wide open.
[1554.34 → 1555.84] You better be careful how you follow.
[1556.40 → 1557.56] Here are some helpful questions.
[1558.32 → 1561.66] What is their, this leader, their life telling you?
[1562.86 → 1564.92] Do they follow Jesus or their own desires?
[1564.92 → 1570.38] And by following them, do they help you follow Jesus better?
[1571.70 → 1572.78] That's a good indicator.
[1573.92 → 1578.28] Do they call themselves Christians, but their life is full of contrary evidence?
[1580.28 → 1580.42] Right?
[1580.42 → 1584.96] And again, I'm not saying you need to follow leaders who are completely sinless.
[1585.06 → 1585.46] Yes, you do.
[1585.52 → 1586.00] That's Jesus.
[1586.26 → 1588.82] But the rest of us are struggling with sin sometimes too.
[1589.02 → 1591.22] And we need repentance, and we need grace too.
[1591.50 → 1596.16] So yes, follow leaders who are confessing that they're broken people too.
[1596.16 → 1598.92] Another question.
[1599.34 → 1604.48] Do they actually follow Jesus or do they try to get Jesus to fit into their cultural understanding?
[1604.88 → 1605.96] I see lots of that.
[1607.24 → 1608.50] We'll just make Jesus fit.
[1610.00 → 1610.44] Right?
[1610.62 → 1611.18] He'll fit.
[1611.56 → 1612.40] Oh, he said this.
[1612.50 → 1614.24] But what he actually means is this.
[1615.44 → 1617.60] And we just mess around with it.
[1617.60 → 1622.32] Do they actively follow Jesus or do they try to get Jesus, as I say, to fit into the culture?
[1622.80 → 1623.78] And then Jude said this way.
[1623.82 → 1624.86] Are they perverting the gospel?
[1625.54 → 1629.78] To live out the life they desire or do they surrender their will for God's?
[1630.76 → 1631.56] Are they fruitful?
[1631.84 → 1634.56] Are they displaying the fruit of the Spirit?
[1634.62 → 1635.66] What's the fruit of the Spirit again?
[1635.88 → 1636.82] Well, out of Galatians, right?
[1637.44 → 1642.86] Are they displaying love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, self-control, gentleness, faithfulness?
[1642.86 → 1646.74] Do they help me follow Jesus no matter what's happening around me?
[1649.70 → 1652.86] And again, Jesus says it this way.
[1653.82 → 1656.90] That thief, that's what he is.
[1657.32 → 1658.36] He's coming for something.
[1658.90 → 1664.24] That thief comes for only to steal and to destroy and to make a mess of things.
[1664.76 → 1670.62] And Jesus said, and I have come to bring you life, life in all its fullness.
[1670.62 → 1674.22] Jesus, who will you follow?
[1676.52 → 1677.12] Let's pray.
[1681.28 → 1685.92] Father God, we come before you and we thank you that you are a God worth following.
[1687.28 → 1691.32] Lord, a lot of us are getting pulled in all kinds of directions sometimes.
[1693.38 → 1694.98] There are a lot of voices out there.
[1695.52 → 1697.92] Some of those voices sound pretty compelling sometimes.
[1697.92 → 1702.40] But Lord, help us to listen for your voice.
[1703.36 → 1706.06] And help us to look at the lives of people who call us to follow them.
[1706.28 → 1710.72] And look at their lives carefully and see whether those lives are reflecting who you are.
[1711.42 → 1714.36] And help us to follow those who help us follow you.
[1715.76 → 1716.82] Oh Lord, give us wisdom.
[1717.56 → 1718.42] Give us courage.
[1718.82 → 1721.58] Help us to know your words so we can be armed with truth.
[1721.58 → 1726.94] Help us to contend for the faith that matters so much.
[1727.28 → 1728.52] In Jesus' name, amen.
[1728.52 → 1728.62] Amen.
