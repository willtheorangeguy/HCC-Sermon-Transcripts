[0.00 --> 9.76]  series on words of waiting, right? Advent is about waiting, waiting in hope and holy expectation
[9.76 --> 17.72]  that God has, is right now, and will accomplish his good will for the world. And out of that
[17.72 --> 24.04]  holy expectation then is where real joy is found. If it wasn't evident enough this morning,
[24.04 --> 31.66]  joy is our word of waiting for us this morning. When you think of the word joy, what phrases or
[31.66 --> 37.26]  ideas come to mind for you? Before we even jump into like the biblical text, you think about joy
[37.26 --> 42.34]  and happiness. What are some of the phrases? Obviously I watched the video as well, the video
[42.34 --> 46.96]  that we saw at the beginning from the Bible Project, they said, they ended the video with, you know, the
[46.96 --> 52.86]  world tells you turn your frown upside down. It's one of the key messages, right? Don't be sad, be happy
[52.86 --> 58.36]  all the time. And then I googled what joy and, googled joy and happiness, and these are some of the
[58.36 --> 63.48]  popular quotes that came up. You'll see on the screen. The first one is, yes, turn your frown upside
[63.48 --> 68.82]  down, and then famous person, I don't know if you've heard of him, Walt Disney. Yeah, so he said,
[68.82 --> 74.78]  after the rain, the sun will reappear. There is life. After the pain, the joy will still be here.
[75.60 --> 82.84]  And then a more modern Christian thinker, theologian, he says, joy does not simply happen to us,
[82.86 --> 88.76]  we have to choose joy and keep choosing it every day. That's reflective of God's people and their
[88.76 --> 94.48]  journey, obviously. And then, as you google, you get a whole bunch of different algorithms pop up at
[94.48 --> 100.00]  you, and I saw two songs that really stuck out to me. I pulled snippets, the lyrics from those,
[100.12 --> 105.40]  from a couple of songs. I just thought it was interesting. So the first song, hopefully some
[105.40 --> 111.46]  of our older generation, you recognize this song. Maybe our younger ones won't, but this is the first one.
[112.86 --> 117.86]  You got to turn the sound on for me. We got to enjoy the mood a little bit.
[121.86 --> 126.28]  Anyone want to just sing it for us? You know what song this is? Don't worry.
[128.68 --> 129.90]  You guys are too fast.
[129.90 --> 138.90]  You guys are too fast. There you go. Oh, somebody's whistling. Thanks, Joel. Wow, that was pretty impressive.
[138.90 --> 146.90]  I thought it was the actual... Okay, don't worry about it. We'll go on to the next one. This is one of my son's favorites, and it's...
[146.90 --> 159.90]  Yeah. It's Happy by Pharrell Williams. Anybody recognize this song from the lyrics? Right? Because I'm...
[159.90 --> 169.36]  Ah, it's such a gloomy happy. Happy. Because I'm happy. Yes, I'm very happy. Right? Nothing can bring me down.
[169.36 --> 177.08]  My level's too high. Can't nothing bring me down because I'm happy. Now, these popular songs and quotes are reflections,
[177.80 --> 185.76]  small snippets of our human existence and desires. Because deep down, all of us, every single one of us,
[186.14 --> 191.60]  crave joy, happiness, and pleasure. Good things for our lives, not bad things.
[191.60 --> 199.02]  And the same desire for joy and happiness is found as a key theme throughout the whole entire Bible.
[200.00 --> 208.56]  It's as if our Holy Scripture speaks about real humans with real lives, seeking what it means to love,
[208.78 --> 216.10]  what it means to be peaceful, what it means to be joyful, rejoicing, and what that really means.
[216.10 --> 224.24]  Because from the beginning, as we read from Genesis 1, God created the whole world, the whole entire universe,
[224.86 --> 232.40]  and then He rested, yes, but He said after each day that the creation that He made was good.
[233.06 --> 237.86]  It was good. It was good. And then at the very end, He said, it was very good.
[237.86 --> 246.84]  In other words, He, our Creator, took joy and pleasure in His beautiful, creative, diverse creation.
[248.22 --> 254.16]  And then part of that beautiful creation is us, human beings, made in His own image.
[254.42 --> 260.82]  This is a very important doctrine, very important teaching, imago Dei, that we are all made in the image of God.
[260.82 --> 272.18]  Why this is important is because just like God takes joy in all of creation, we, made in His image, also find real joy in creation as well.
[272.52 --> 275.34]  That's where I want to start before we get into our Isaiah text.
[276.56 --> 279.78]  A lot of the songs express different feelings.
[280.48 --> 287.30]  But particularly, Psalm 104 is a longer psalm that details all the beauty of creation.
[287.30 --> 289.60]  And then at the end, the psalmist says,
[289.90 --> 291.78]  I will sing to the Lord all my life.
[292.30 --> 295.30]  I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
[295.72 --> 303.44]  May my meditation be pleasing to God as I rejoice in the Lord, as I find joy in the Lord.
[304.72 --> 307.56]  And thinking about what real joy looks like then,
[307.92 --> 313.62]  we find that source of joy in God as we read from the prophet Isaiah again.
[313.62 --> 320.88]  Isaiah speaks about God's people finding joy and praising Him for His sovereignty and goodness.
[321.70 --> 323.48]  Sovereignty, which is something we'll get into.
[324.02 --> 329.22]  And so if you have your Bibles with you, my Bible is just kind of filled with glitter from the table for some reason.
[329.60 --> 336.42]  If you have a non-shiny Bible with you, and even if it's not the God-ordained NIV version, that's okay.
[337.16 --> 342.38]  Whatever version you have, I encourage you to bring your Bibles and turn with me to Isaiah 55.
[342.38 --> 345.86]  If not, it'll be available on the screen for you.
[347.78 --> 350.82]  We read from verse 6 from Isaiah 55.
[372.38 --> 381.82]  And the Lord goes on to say,
[381.82 --> 388.60]  As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
[389.24 --> 396.42]  As the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish,
[396.56 --> 399.46]  so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater,
[400.56 --> 403.48]  so is my word that goes out from my mouth.
[403.48 --> 411.34]  It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
[412.26 --> 418.10]  So then you, all my people, will go out in joy and be led forth in shalom.
[418.76 --> 424.64]  The mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands.
[424.64 --> 430.52]  Instead of the thorn bush will grow the juniper, and instead of briars the myrtle will grow.
[430.96 --> 436.18]  This will be for the Lord's renown, for an everlasting sign that will endure forever.
[436.74 --> 438.28]  This is the word of the Lord.
[439.72 --> 440.48]  Thank you.
[440.48 --> 452.44]  From our passage this morning, I would suggest that there are two main things, two main takeaways for God's people, which is us.
[453.16 --> 457.00]  One, just as we heard from the video at the beginning of the service,
[457.52 --> 462.84]  joy is an attitude that God's people adopt, not because of happy circumstances,
[463.26 --> 466.34]  but because of their hope in God's love and promises.
[466.34 --> 470.94]  In other words, God is the foundation of real joy.
[471.94 --> 473.36]  That's one key takeaway.
[473.92 --> 481.98]  Second, we find real joy in God, our foundation, because God's word and his promises are trustworthy.
[483.44 --> 486.80]  When all else fail, his word doesn't.
[487.44 --> 488.28]  That's good news.
[489.18 --> 495.98]  God's word, his will, his mission, and his loving mercy is trustworthy and true.
[496.82 --> 497.30]  Always.
[498.20 --> 499.94]  So follow with me the logic here.
[500.02 --> 506.02]  If, therefore, God is the unshakable, reliable foundation for us,
[506.34 --> 513.48]  the more we are aligned to him, the more we are aligned to his will and his purposes for the world,
[514.04 --> 519.32]  then the more we will be able to glimpse and live in real joy,
[519.94 --> 523.38]  because our foundation is in him and his will.
[523.38 --> 528.22]  It's a full blessed cycle, if you can picture it that way.
[529.08 --> 531.94]  Our joy is an adopted attitude because we trust in God.
[532.26 --> 536.18]  And the more we trust in God and are aligned with his will,
[536.42 --> 538.76]  the more joy we will be able to live out.
[538.96 --> 540.16]  It's an ongoing thing.
[540.58 --> 546.16]  And so even in the hardships of life, within this blessed cycle, with God being our foundation,
[546.16 --> 551.60]  we can find joy and choose joy because God is with us.
[552.48 --> 555.78]  So with that in mind, let's walk through our passage from Isaiah
[555.78 --> 559.60]  and how it reflects this joyful good news for God's people.
[560.40 --> 563.84]  The structure of the passage that we read is actually pretty simple.
[564.12 --> 565.44]  It's split into three parts.
[565.86 --> 571.42]  First, from verses 6 to 9, it's about seeking God for forgiveness.
[571.42 --> 573.24]  It's about repentance.
[573.90 --> 575.02]  And this is very significant.
[575.16 --> 576.04]  This is where we start.
[576.66 --> 580.54]  Finding real joy starts with asking for forgiveness and repenting.
[581.18 --> 585.98]  Second, in verses 10 to 11, we are told, proclaimed,
[586.64 --> 589.26]  that God's words are reliable and effective.
[590.12 --> 591.72]  He is sovereign, we say.
[591.82 --> 594.84]  He's all-powerful and his words will never fail.
[595.68 --> 597.84]  And then because of these foundational things,
[597.84 --> 603.90]  we have this last section in our passage where we burst out with all of creation in a song of joy.
[605.14 --> 606.76]  So let's start from the beginning.
[607.40 --> 612.74]  As I mentioned, it is so significant that the beginning of finding real joy in our passage
[612.74 --> 617.18]  starts with repentance and seeking God for forgiveness.
[618.36 --> 621.34]  Against the message of looking within ourselves,
[621.76 --> 623.98]  maybe suppressing all sadness and gloom,
[623.98 --> 627.92]  and then forcing ourselves to be happy out of our own strength and logic.
[628.80 --> 631.86]  Isaiah, this passage, says, don't start there.
[632.28 --> 634.78]  You don't start with your own strength and your own wisdom,
[635.20 --> 637.92]  your own joyfulness, whatever you have.
[638.82 --> 643.10]  It starts with seeking God and seeking for forgiveness.
[645.40 --> 651.04]  The prophet calls the people who are thirsty and who are desperate in sadness to repent.
[651.52 --> 652.26]  That's verse 1.
[652.26 --> 654.50]  We didn't read it, but we'll read it now.
[654.58 --> 656.22]  At the beginning of this chapter that we read,
[656.78 --> 659.72]  from chapter 55, verse 1 says,
[659.84 --> 661.80]  Come all you who are thirsty,
[662.22 --> 663.14]  come to the waters,
[663.62 --> 665.82]  and you who have no money, come buy and eat.
[666.42 --> 667.98]  Come buy wine and milk,
[668.58 --> 670.38]  without money and without cost.
[671.10 --> 672.16]  This is the invitation.
[672.68 --> 673.82]  And then it goes on
[673.82 --> 676.08]  to our verse, in verse 6,
[676.20 --> 676.80]  where it says,
[676.80 --> 678.92]  seek the Lord while he may be found.
[679.32 --> 681.10]  Call on him while he is near.
[681.72 --> 682.48]  Let the wicked,
[683.76 --> 684.42]  that's us,
[684.76 --> 686.54]  let the wicked forsake their ways
[686.54 --> 688.30]  and the unrighteous their thoughts.
[688.86 --> 690.74]  Let them turn to the Lord,
[691.04 --> 692.42]  and he will have mercy on them.
[692.66 --> 694.28]  Let them turn to God,
[694.58 --> 696.28]  for he will abundantly forgive.
[696.44 --> 698.24]  I know it says freely forgive in our
[698.24 --> 700.46]  God-ordained NIV passage,
[700.46 --> 704.10]  but abundantly makes it better to understand.
[704.68 --> 706.04]  God always forgives.
[706.28 --> 707.50]  He is slow to anger,
[708.00 --> 709.66]  and is abounding in love,
[710.04 --> 711.34]  and is loving mercy.
[713.46 --> 715.48]  So, you might,
[715.68 --> 717.48]  if you didn't grow up in the church,
[718.22 --> 718.96]  you might be thinking,
[719.06 --> 720.14]  what is this guy talking about
[720.14 --> 721.60]  when he keeps saying repenting?
[722.22 --> 722.42]  Right?
[722.60 --> 724.42]  What does repent mean?
[725.34 --> 725.56]  Right?
[725.74 --> 726.58]  When you think of it,
[726.64 --> 727.46]  do you think of,
[727.66 --> 729.50]  like, feeling sorry and apologizing
[729.50 --> 730.60]  for something you did wrong?
[731.32 --> 733.30]  Feeling guilty and feeling bad for yourself?
[734.38 --> 736.34]  Being motivated to try harder, maybe?
[736.50 --> 737.22]  To shape up?
[738.14 --> 739.10]  Seeking forgiveness?
[740.64 --> 741.52]  Yes, like,
[741.60 --> 744.36]  these are parts of what it means to repent.
[745.18 --> 746.46]  But let's make it simpler.
[746.80 --> 748.16]  What does that word actually,
[748.84 --> 750.58]  how is that word actually defined?
[751.36 --> 752.96]  The word, the verb,
[753.16 --> 753.98]  it's an action word,
[754.06 --> 754.62]  to repent,
[755.00 --> 758.08]  is simply meaning to turn around 180 degrees.
[758.08 --> 760.28]  So, if you leave your house,
[760.34 --> 761.70]  and you forgot to take your keys,
[762.08 --> 764.40]  to repent is to turn around 180 degrees,
[764.52 --> 765.60]  to go get your keys.
[765.88 --> 767.46]  That's simply what that verb means.
[768.48 --> 771.84]  But in our biblical gospel context then,
[772.76 --> 774.92]  to turn 180 degrees,
[775.04 --> 776.64]  away from our wicked ways,
[776.86 --> 778.60]  and turn to the right way,
[779.10 --> 780.84]  means to turn to the way of God.
[781.46 --> 782.58]  To the way of truth,
[782.94 --> 784.48]  to the way of righteousness.
[784.48 --> 787.66]  In other words,
[788.08 --> 790.90]  it's to live in the way of blessing,
[791.24 --> 793.10]  as opposed to the way of curse,
[793.88 --> 794.48]  and death,
[794.86 --> 795.30]  and sin.
[796.10 --> 799.16]  This is the key theme that we will look at,
[799.36 --> 802.32]  as we trace that throughout the whole Bible story in the new year.
[802.54 --> 803.44]  That's our next series.
[803.44 --> 806.52]  And as mentioned,
[807.12 --> 808.86]  so turning to the right way,
[809.04 --> 809.98]  to the way of blessing,
[810.88 --> 812.46]  part of this repenting then,
[812.94 --> 814.68]  is to ask for forgiveness.
[815.52 --> 815.88]  Why?
[817.06 --> 820.30]  Because we constantly live in the way of curse,
[820.48 --> 821.30]  and brokenness,
[821.42 --> 822.88]  and we fall to our temptations,
[823.00 --> 823.62]  and our weaknesses,
[823.82 --> 824.26]  and sins.
[825.22 --> 827.66]  So, we seek God in repentance,
[827.66 --> 829.58]  so that we can turn to Him,
[829.62 --> 830.44]  and His ways.
[830.44 --> 834.52]  We confess our shortcomings,
[834.74 --> 835.54]  and brokenness,
[835.60 --> 836.90]  and seek God for forgiveness.
[837.62 --> 838.14]  And that's why,
[838.28 --> 839.82]  even as we gather for worship,
[840.10 --> 840.96]  our worship leaders,
[841.46 --> 842.98]  lead us in a prayer of confession,
[843.12 --> 844.18]  during our worship time.
[845.32 --> 846.72]  But here's the catch.
[847.36 --> 847.54]  Right?
[848.30 --> 850.52]  Yes, it is to seek forgiveness.
[851.46 --> 853.10]  But the main key,
[854.00 --> 854.72]  to repenting,
[854.80 --> 855.68]  is to repent,
[855.94 --> 858.30]  and ask God for forgiveness.
[858.74 --> 859.50]  That's the key.
[859.50 --> 861.64]  You're not just feeling sorry for yourself.
[861.82 --> 862.98]  You're not just feeling guilty,
[862.98 --> 864.20]  because you did something wrong.
[864.82 --> 867.00]  It is to turn to our God,
[867.72 --> 869.54]  and asking Him for forgiveness.
[870.66 --> 871.18]  Why?
[872.52 --> 873.04]  Because,
[873.44 --> 875.34]  He's the only one who can.
[876.50 --> 878.44]  He's the only one who can,
[878.94 --> 879.72]  forgive our sins.
[879.90 --> 882.60]  The only one who has the power to do so.
[883.92 --> 885.06]  And so, remember,
[885.52 --> 886.90]  whenever Jesus had conflicts,
[886.90 --> 887.82]  with the Pharisees,
[887.88 --> 888.90]  and the teachers of the law,
[888.90 --> 891.50]  these Jews had the right idea.
[891.60 --> 893.02]  They were asking the right question.
[894.22 --> 895.54]  As He was healing,
[895.86 --> 896.82]  He was also what?
[897.60 --> 899.74]  He was also forgiving people's sins.
[900.22 --> 900.86]  And...
[900.86 --> 908.44]  Who is this person
[908.44 --> 910.54]  that has the power to heal,
[910.64 --> 911.26]  for one thing,
[911.40 --> 913.48]  but also has the power to forgive?
[913.48 --> 915.14]  Who does He think He is?
[915.14 --> 916.94]  Does He think He's God?
[918.54 --> 919.14]  Yes.
[919.86 --> 922.42]  He is the Son of God.
[922.84 --> 923.98]  God in the flesh,
[924.24 --> 926.60]  who came to forgive all of our sins,
[926.80 --> 927.78]  once and for all.
[927.98 --> 929.52]  That's the good news.
[930.22 --> 932.26]  But I just want to sympathize with the Jews,
[932.80 --> 935.28]  because they were asking the right questions.
[935.28 --> 937.90]  Who is this person
[937.90 --> 939.84]  who is able to forgive?
[940.84 --> 942.52]  And this one person
[942.52 --> 944.42]  that is able
[944.42 --> 946.36]  and has the power to forgive,
[947.10 --> 948.04]  came in the flesh,
[948.78 --> 950.18]  was born in a lowly manger,
[950.32 --> 950.74]  as you saw,
[950.84 --> 951.94]  demonstrated by our kids,
[952.60 --> 955.52]  took up that curse of death on the cross,
[955.52 --> 958.20]  so that we may be forgiven our sins.
[958.20 --> 961.36]  That's the teaching,
[961.50 --> 963.40]  that's the doctrine we call atonement.
[963.74 --> 964.86]  That is good news.
[965.14 --> 966.30]  And that's the heart
[966.30 --> 967.84]  of the Christmas message.
[968.28 --> 969.78]  That's why we celebrate Christmas
[969.78 --> 970.74]  in the first place.
[973.04 --> 974.62]  And our loving Father,
[974.94 --> 976.80]  through the sacrifice of His own Son,
[977.16 --> 978.72]  and His victory over death,
[979.12 --> 980.98]  did all this so that
[980.98 --> 982.60]  we as His people
[982.60 --> 984.44]  may be free from slavery,
[984.82 --> 985.62]  from our brokenness,
[985.76 --> 987.70]  and that we may be able to follow Him
[987.70 --> 990.12]  and align more and more with Him
[990.12 --> 992.20]  by the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
[994.12 --> 996.26]  For as it says in our passage today,
[997.38 --> 998.08]  our thoughts,
[998.82 --> 1001.14]  even the smartest of us,
[1001.58 --> 1003.20]  cannot and is not
[1003.20 --> 1005.22]  perfectly similar to God's ways.
[1006.88 --> 1008.04]  This Arab transition,
[1008.16 --> 1009.36]  what I'm trying to say is that
[1009.36 --> 1011.18]  not any single one of us
[1011.18 --> 1013.22]  or a collection of the smartest
[1013.22 --> 1014.84]  Christians and theologians
[1014.84 --> 1016.46]  have the ability
[1016.46 --> 1018.54]  to know exactly
[1018.54 --> 1020.42]  what the mind and will of God is.
[1020.58 --> 1021.88]  We discern together.
[1022.82 --> 1023.90]  It's a call of humility.
[1025.42 --> 1028.34]  That's why God came to us.
[1028.62 --> 1029.60]  We didn't go to Him.
[1030.74 --> 1033.22]  His Holy Spirit now guides His people
[1033.22 --> 1034.40]  so that we can reflect
[1034.40 --> 1035.52]  and we can glimpse
[1035.52 --> 1037.22]  and we can reveal
[1037.22 --> 1039.62]  more and more of what real joy is,
[1039.62 --> 1041.70]  which is found only in Him.
[1043.32 --> 1043.94]  So again,
[1044.44 --> 1045.26]  we are desperate
[1045.26 --> 1047.14]  for His guidance.
[1048.18 --> 1048.80]  His thoughts
[1048.80 --> 1050.30]  are higher than our thoughts
[1050.30 --> 1051.86]  and His ways
[1051.86 --> 1053.26]  are trustworthy and reliable
[1053.26 --> 1054.70]  because it never fails.
[1057.12 --> 1058.04]  And so Isaiah then,
[1058.98 --> 1059.72]  now that he has
[1059.72 --> 1061.08]  called for trust
[1061.08 --> 1062.02]  of God's people
[1062.02 --> 1062.88]  to trust in His
[1062.88 --> 1064.58]  ways and His will,
[1065.16 --> 1065.62]  demonstrates
[1065.62 --> 1067.26]  or pictures for us
[1067.26 --> 1068.40]  in a poetic illustration
[1068.40 --> 1069.48]  that compares
[1069.48 --> 1070.72]  this word of the Lord,
[1071.12 --> 1071.74]  God's will,
[1072.18 --> 1073.02]  to rain and snow,
[1073.22 --> 1074.14]  which never fails
[1074.14 --> 1075.30]  to fall in due time.
[1075.92 --> 1077.24]  It's beautiful poetry here.
[1078.06 --> 1078.60]  Before we get
[1078.60 --> 1079.34]  to the beauty part,
[1080.28 --> 1081.04]  let's think about it
[1081.04 --> 1082.02]  in our modern context.
[1082.14 --> 1082.62]  Right now,
[1083.50 --> 1084.84]  it's winter, right?
[1085.22 --> 1086.18]  It's like saying
[1086.18 --> 1087.02]  you may be going through
[1087.02 --> 1088.26]  the most life-changing
[1088.26 --> 1089.10]  and difficult,
[1089.56 --> 1091.14]  catastrophic circumstances
[1091.14 --> 1091.82]  in your life,
[1092.26 --> 1093.44]  but the winter
[1093.44 --> 1094.42]  is still coming.
[1095.02 --> 1096.06]  It's here already.
[1096.06 --> 1097.80]  You can't stop that
[1097.80 --> 1098.38]  from happening.
[1099.46 --> 1100.32]  And due to that
[1100.32 --> 1101.56]  winter cold coming,
[1101.94 --> 1103.18]  it will cause change
[1103.18 --> 1103.80]  in your life
[1103.80 --> 1105.62]  to turn on the heater more,
[1105.76 --> 1106.84]  to wear more layers,
[1107.00 --> 1107.76]  and if you're like me,
[1108.02 --> 1108.88]  you kind of sort of
[1108.88 --> 1109.52]  have to stop
[1109.52 --> 1110.48]  drinking iced coffee,
[1111.00 --> 1111.72]  although I love
[1111.72 --> 1112.50]  my iced coffee.
[1112.90 --> 1114.58]  But it causes change.
[1115.04 --> 1115.88]  And so just like
[1115.88 --> 1116.56]  the winter cold
[1116.56 --> 1117.32]  causes change
[1117.32 --> 1118.10]  in our lives,
[1119.28 --> 1120.22]  Isaiah says,
[1120.60 --> 1121.42]  just like rain
[1121.42 --> 1122.34]  and snow falls
[1122.34 --> 1123.22]  and it never fails
[1123.22 --> 1123.72]  to fall,
[1124.00 --> 1125.30]  and it will water
[1125.30 --> 1125.82]  the earth
[1125.82 --> 1126.98]  and cause the earth
[1126.98 --> 1128.60]  to bear fruit,
[1129.08 --> 1130.18]  in the same way,
[1130.60 --> 1131.24]  God's word
[1131.24 --> 1132.54]  will never fail
[1132.54 --> 1133.14]  to fall,
[1133.58 --> 1134.86]  and it will never fail
[1134.86 --> 1136.00]  to bear the fruit
[1136.00 --> 1137.60]  that He has planned already.
[1141.50 --> 1142.46]  God's words
[1142.46 --> 1143.34]  are powerful.
[1144.16 --> 1144.68]  And I'm going to
[1144.68 --> 1145.44]  throw this word out
[1145.44 --> 1146.10]  again and again.
[1146.38 --> 1147.52]  God is sovereign.
[1148.80 --> 1149.54]  That's what we say.
[1149.58 --> 1150.70]  He's all-powerful.
[1150.96 --> 1152.52]  Everything is in His hands.
[1152.52 --> 1154.38]  Remember that
[1154.38 --> 1155.34]  at the very beginning
[1155.34 --> 1156.36]  when God created
[1156.36 --> 1156.88]  the world,
[1157.38 --> 1158.32]  He didn't necessarily
[1158.32 --> 1159.38]  make everything
[1159.38 --> 1160.52]  with His hands,
[1160.72 --> 1161.62]  whatever that looks like.
[1162.22 --> 1163.14]  How did He create
[1163.14 --> 1163.56]  the world?
[1165.98 --> 1167.12]  He spoke it
[1167.12 --> 1167.70]  into being.
[1168.18 --> 1169.38]  That's how powerful
[1169.38 --> 1170.18]  His words are.
[1171.34 --> 1172.74]  Doesn't need anything else.
[1172.94 --> 1173.56]  God just said,
[1173.72 --> 1174.32]  let there be light.
[1175.00 --> 1176.40]  He spoke the word
[1176.40 --> 1177.58]  into being
[1177.58 --> 1178.30]  out of nothing.
[1178.30 --> 1179.98]  And in the same
[1179.98 --> 1181.00]  beautiful way,
[1181.76 --> 1182.12]  Jesus
[1182.12 --> 1184.68]  came as
[1184.68 --> 1185.80]  the living word
[1185.80 --> 1186.50]  of God
[1186.50 --> 1187.06]  Himself
[1187.06 --> 1188.62]  in the flesh.
[1188.94 --> 1189.50]  As it says
[1189.50 --> 1190.52]  in the Gospel of John,
[1190.66 --> 1190.84]  right?
[1191.28 --> 1191.94]  In the beginning
[1191.94 --> 1193.74]  was the word,
[1194.34 --> 1194.78]  the logos.
[1196.06 --> 1197.30]  He was with God
[1197.30 --> 1198.66]  and He was God
[1198.66 --> 1199.34]  and He came
[1199.34 --> 1200.26]  to accomplish
[1200.26 --> 1201.68]  God's good will.
[1202.62 --> 1204.06]  It has happened.
[1205.70 --> 1206.30]  His word
[1206.30 --> 1207.38]  never fails.
[1207.38 --> 1208.66]  That's our Jesus.
[1210.24 --> 1211.00]  So I think
[1211.00 --> 1211.62]  I've emphasized
[1211.62 --> 1212.42]  God's sovereignty
[1212.42 --> 1212.96]  enough here.
[1213.78 --> 1214.90]  The other part of this,
[1215.32 --> 1216.20]  God is all powerful
[1216.20 --> 1216.80]  and sovereign
[1216.80 --> 1219.06]  and this God of ours,
[1219.50 --> 1220.50]  He's also loving.
[1221.56 --> 1222.46]  It's not just
[1222.46 --> 1223.76]  some random will
[1223.76 --> 1224.32]  that He's trying
[1224.32 --> 1224.94]  to accomplish.
[1225.64 --> 1227.10]  It is His loving,
[1227.74 --> 1228.74]  good will
[1228.74 --> 1229.44]  for the world
[1229.44 --> 1230.26]  and for us.
[1232.38 --> 1233.52]  That's part
[1233.52 --> 1235.08]  of this plan of His.
[1235.50 --> 1236.86]  Part of the redemption.
[1237.38 --> 1238.44]  is hope,
[1239.12 --> 1239.72]  it's peace,
[1239.92 --> 1240.32]  it's love
[1240.32 --> 1241.40]  that we'll look at next week
[1241.40 --> 1243.16]  and it is joy.
[1243.72 --> 1244.84]  It is to rejoice
[1244.84 --> 1246.34]  with all of creation
[1246.34 --> 1247.42]  and with our Maker.
[1248.38 --> 1250.06]  That's part of God's will
[1250.06 --> 1251.72]  and this plan
[1251.72 --> 1253.56]  has already been accomplished
[1253.56 --> 1254.60]  and will continue
[1254.60 --> 1255.46]  to be revealed
[1255.46 --> 1256.22]  through His people.
[1257.24 --> 1257.92]  The good news
[1257.92 --> 1259.22]  of His new creation,
[1259.62 --> 1260.40]  a place where
[1260.40 --> 1261.92]  all of our holy waiting
[1261.92 --> 1263.26]  and expecting,
[1263.50 --> 1263.78]  Advent,
[1264.28 --> 1265.88]  become fully realized
[1265.88 --> 1267.20]  where real joy
[1267.20 --> 1268.70]  is fully lived out.
[1269.64 --> 1270.78]  I can't even begin
[1270.78 --> 1272.32]  to express
[1272.32 --> 1272.92]  what that joy
[1272.92 --> 1273.58]  will look like.
[1273.80 --> 1275.00]  We get glimpses of it.
[1275.12 --> 1275.38]  Again,
[1275.54 --> 1276.36]  the more and more
[1276.36 --> 1277.20]  we are aligned
[1277.20 --> 1277.86]  to His will.
[1280.70 --> 1282.28]  And so as it is revealed
[1282.28 --> 1282.94]  through Jesus,
[1283.08 --> 1283.94]  our Lord and Savior,
[1284.64 --> 1286.12]  the more Christ-like
[1286.12 --> 1286.68]  we are,
[1287.04 --> 1288.22]  the more we'll be able
[1288.22 --> 1288.80]  to glimpse
[1288.80 --> 1289.82]  and foretaste
[1289.82 --> 1290.84]  that joy.
[1290.84 --> 1293.06]  So that's reflected
[1293.06 --> 1293.56]  in Isaiah.
[1293.74 --> 1294.20]  We go back
[1294.20 --> 1294.90]  to verse 12.
[1296.16 --> 1296.64]  God's word
[1296.64 --> 1297.20]  is trustworthy
[1297.20 --> 1298.80]  and then Isaiah says,
[1299.30 --> 1299.52]  you,
[1299.88 --> 1300.64]  all of you,
[1300.92 --> 1301.66]  God's people,
[1302.20 --> 1303.48]  will go out
[1303.48 --> 1304.08]  in joy
[1304.08 --> 1305.40]  and be led forth
[1305.40 --> 1306.18]  in shalom.
[1307.34 --> 1308.60]  That now connects us
[1308.60 --> 1309.90]  to last week's sermon
[1309.90 --> 1310.70]  by Pastor Sid.
[1311.18 --> 1311.40]  Right?
[1311.86 --> 1313.06]  You find real joy
[1313.06 --> 1313.58]  in God
[1313.58 --> 1315.12]  and you shall be led forth
[1315.12 --> 1315.82]  in shalom,
[1315.96 --> 1316.62]  real peace.
[1318.16 --> 1319.68]  Little reminder exercise.
[1319.68 --> 1320.72]  Peace,
[1321.34 --> 1322.72]  and I would appropriately add
[1322.72 --> 1323.74]  joy here,
[1323.92 --> 1325.40]  is not just the absence
[1325.40 --> 1326.44]  of conflict,
[1326.78 --> 1327.24]  violence,
[1327.54 --> 1327.80]  sadness,
[1327.96 --> 1328.54]  and loss.
[1329.12 --> 1330.94]  It's also the presence
[1330.94 --> 1332.26]  of Jesus,
[1332.52 --> 1332.98]  our Savior,
[1333.74 --> 1334.80]  the true foundation
[1334.80 --> 1336.12]  of our joy.
[1337.50 --> 1338.78]  So that's what we look
[1338.78 --> 1339.58]  forward to.
[1342.22 --> 1343.40]  That's our hope
[1343.40 --> 1344.26]  and that's what
[1344.26 --> 1345.26]  the Advent season
[1345.26 --> 1346.02]  calls for.
[1347.24 --> 1348.26]  But I sigh here
[1348.26 --> 1350.54]  because it's not easy
[1350.54 --> 1351.30]  when we wait.
[1352.40 --> 1352.56]  Right?
[1353.02 --> 1354.54]  Especially in our generation,
[1354.66 --> 1355.22]  I want to say.
[1355.82 --> 1356.96]  It's not easy waiting.
[1358.06 --> 1358.22]  Right?
[1359.06 --> 1360.10]  Same day delivery
[1360.10 --> 1360.76]  from Amazon.
[1361.20 --> 1362.52]  That's even becoming
[1362.52 --> 1363.36]  difficult to wait.
[1363.76 --> 1365.08]  Don't even get me started
[1365.08 --> 1365.92]  with Canada Post.
[1366.00 --> 1366.20]  Right?
[1367.26 --> 1370.08]  We have a hard time waiting.
[1370.34 --> 1371.96]  It doesn't come easy for us.
[1372.10 --> 1374.00]  It doesn't come natural for us,
[1374.04 --> 1374.78]  I want to say,
[1374.84 --> 1376.20]  in our sinful brokenness.
[1376.20 --> 1379.10]  And because of this
[1379.10 --> 1380.18]  difficulty in waiting,
[1380.96 --> 1381.76]  this difficulty
[1381.76 --> 1382.74]  bleeds into
[1382.74 --> 1383.52]  our difficulty
[1383.52 --> 1384.64]  in repenting
[1384.64 --> 1385.84]  and looking for God's will
[1385.84 --> 1386.66]  in the first place.
[1388.32 --> 1389.40]  In other words,
[1389.50 --> 1390.58]  instead of finding joy
[1390.58 --> 1391.30]  in God
[1391.30 --> 1392.66]  and trying to discern
[1392.66 --> 1393.44]  His ways,
[1393.82 --> 1395.26]  it's so tempting
[1395.26 --> 1397.02]  and it's so easy
[1397.02 --> 1398.66]  to find pleasures
[1398.66 --> 1399.42]  and happiness
[1399.42 --> 1400.00]  and joy
[1400.00 --> 1400.86]  in our own ways.
[1400.86 --> 1403.62]  So the question
[1403.62 --> 1404.64]  I want to ask is,
[1405.18 --> 1406.66]  where or in what
[1406.66 --> 1407.78]  do you find
[1407.78 --> 1409.08]  happiness and joy in?
[1411.68 --> 1412.74]  In our attempt
[1412.74 --> 1413.80]  to find real joy,
[1414.80 --> 1416.18]  we often fall
[1416.18 --> 1417.08]  to simple things,
[1417.14 --> 1417.52]  don't we?
[1418.60 --> 1419.74]  Phones is one thing.
[1420.10 --> 1420.56]  That's a simple,
[1420.66 --> 1421.40]  that's an easy one
[1421.40 --> 1421.98]  to call out.
[1422.42 --> 1423.04]  Our phones.
[1423.70 --> 1424.64]  Or games.
[1425.10 --> 1425.94]  Or work.
[1426.66 --> 1427.72]  Many of us struggle
[1427.72 --> 1429.38]  with working too much.
[1429.84 --> 1430.72]  Working too hard.
[1431.22 --> 1432.02]  Devoting our lives
[1432.02 --> 1433.18]  too much into our work
[1433.18 --> 1434.30]  because we want
[1434.30 --> 1435.42]  to find satisfaction
[1435.42 --> 1436.58]  and real joy
[1436.58 --> 1437.46]  in something
[1437.46 --> 1438.80]  in our lives.
[1439.82 --> 1440.38]  Or,
[1440.78 --> 1442.16]  more destructive things
[1442.16 --> 1443.38]  like pornography,
[1444.08 --> 1444.48]  drugs,
[1444.94 --> 1445.36]  fame,
[1445.82 --> 1447.04]  and other abusive things.
[1448.66 --> 1449.42]  And due to the
[1449.42 --> 1450.30]  impermanence
[1450.30 --> 1451.82]  of such non-God things
[1451.82 --> 1452.70]  that we depend on,
[1452.94 --> 1454.12]  it's so short-lived
[1454.12 --> 1455.36]  and we end up
[1455.36 --> 1456.52]  craving more and more of it.
[1456.58 --> 1457.68]  That's what addiction means.
[1459.46 --> 1460.42]  These things
[1460.42 --> 1461.52]  so easily become
[1461.52 --> 1462.08]  that addiction
[1462.08 --> 1463.08]  that gets out of hand,
[1463.36 --> 1464.38]  that wreaks destruction
[1464.38 --> 1465.88]  and chaos in our lives.
[1466.00 --> 1467.10]  But when you think of it,
[1467.80 --> 1469.90]  the core of that addiction
[1469.90 --> 1472.08]  is a deep desire
[1472.08 --> 1472.54]  and longing
[1472.54 --> 1473.54]  to find happiness
[1473.54 --> 1474.02]  and joy.
[1475.78 --> 1476.76]  That's the irony.
[1477.82 --> 1478.06]  And so,
[1478.20 --> 1478.98]  as Blaise Pascal,
[1479.64 --> 1480.62]  a 17th century
[1480.62 --> 1481.42]  Christian thinker,
[1481.68 --> 1482.50]  famously said,
[1482.50 --> 1485.12]  there is a God-shaped vacuum
[1485.12 --> 1485.66]  in the heart
[1485.66 --> 1486.60]  of each person
[1486.60 --> 1488.44]  which cannot be satisfied
[1488.44 --> 1489.88]  by any created thing
[1489.88 --> 1491.98]  but only by God the Creator
[1491.98 --> 1493.02]  made known
[1493.02 --> 1494.04]  through Jesus Christ.
[1496.66 --> 1497.56]  That's why
[1497.56 --> 1498.96]  this passage,
[1499.12 --> 1500.40]  this Word of God
[1500.40 --> 1501.90]  from thousands of years ago
[1501.90 --> 1503.14]  through the prophet Isaiah
[1503.14 --> 1504.68]  is so applicable
[1504.68 --> 1505.72]  for us today
[1505.72 --> 1506.88]  as it was back then.
[1506.88 --> 1508.74]  We,
[1508.96 --> 1510.00]  as the people of God
[1510.00 --> 1510.86]  here and now,
[1511.10 --> 1512.24]  are not a people
[1512.24 --> 1512.98]  who's perfect
[1512.98 --> 1514.94]  but we are a people
[1514.94 --> 1516.30]  who strive to live
[1516.30 --> 1517.50]  with our foundation
[1517.50 --> 1518.46]  being God.
[1518.78 --> 1519.06]  We,
[1520.10 --> 1520.62]  a people
[1520.62 --> 1521.68]  who's humble enough
[1521.68 --> 1522.38]  to repent
[1522.38 --> 1524.22]  and to try and seek
[1524.22 --> 1525.14]  God's ways
[1525.14 --> 1526.76]  and not our own ways.
[1527.22 --> 1528.46]  That's who we are.
[1529.30 --> 1530.34]  That's why we say
[1530.34 --> 1531.04]  even today
[1531.04 --> 1532.54]  that our foundation
[1532.54 --> 1534.22]  for real joy
[1534.22 --> 1535.40]  is found in God.
[1535.40 --> 1537.28]  even in the face
[1537.28 --> 1537.80]  of suffering
[1537.80 --> 1538.64]  and brokenness.
[1539.88 --> 1540.36]  Again,
[1540.56 --> 1541.38]  this doesn't mean
[1541.38 --> 1542.80]  ignoring or suppressing
[1542.80 --> 1544.14]  real grief and sadness
[1544.14 --> 1546.02]  as maybe some of you
[1546.02 --> 1546.74]  had to deal with
[1546.74 --> 1547.72]  growing up in the church.
[1548.22 --> 1548.48]  Hey,
[1548.70 --> 1549.68]  God's on your side.
[1549.74 --> 1550.60]  You shouldn't be sad.
[1551.16 --> 1552.12]  Don't talk about grief.
[1552.24 --> 1553.54]  Don't talk about your suffering.
[1554.44 --> 1554.76]  Remember,
[1554.90 --> 1555.94]  God is all-powerful.
[1556.06 --> 1556.94]  We need to be joyful.
[1558.52 --> 1559.44]  But that's not
[1559.44 --> 1560.40]  the gospel message.
[1560.52 --> 1561.02]  That's not what
[1561.02 --> 1562.26]  even Jesus tells us.
[1563.68 --> 1564.82]  But before we get to Jesus,
[1564.82 --> 1566.28]  one more Old Testament connection.
[1567.22 --> 1567.84]  God's people
[1567.84 --> 1568.90]  through the Exodus story.
[1569.02 --> 1569.60]  Think about it.
[1570.52 --> 1571.62]  The first generation
[1571.62 --> 1572.60]  that did not make it
[1572.60 --> 1573.66]  into the promised land.
[1573.76 --> 1574.66]  Where did they end up?
[1575.14 --> 1576.28]  They went into the wilderness.
[1577.72 --> 1578.06]  Imagine...
[1594.82 --> 1600.34]  And enter the promised land.
[1600.34 --> 1602.66]  God went to them
[1602.66 --> 1604.42]  and dwelt with them
[1604.42 --> 1605.30]  in the wilderness.
[1606.64 --> 1607.96]  That's our God.
[1609.02 --> 1610.66]  And they rejoiced
[1610.66 --> 1612.40]  and they praised God
[1612.40 --> 1613.46]  in the wilderness,
[1613.92 --> 1615.48]  which testifies,
[1615.70 --> 1616.86]  which is what we,
[1617.20 --> 1618.04]  as a people of God,
[1618.10 --> 1618.82]  are called to,
[1619.24 --> 1620.22]  that it's not based
[1620.22 --> 1621.50]  on happy circumstances,
[1621.50 --> 1623.72]  but in any circumstance,
[1624.12 --> 1625.06]  we can find joy
[1625.06 --> 1626.84]  because God is with us.
[1627.26 --> 1628.98]  That's why we suffer together.
[1629.48 --> 1631.36]  That's why we grieve together,
[1631.60 --> 1632.42]  like when we did
[1632.42 --> 1633.26]  at the lament service
[1633.26 --> 1634.06]  a few days ago.
[1636.36 --> 1637.84]  And so we turn to Jesus
[1637.84 --> 1638.94]  as we come to a close.
[1640.62 --> 1641.74]  When Jesus taught
[1641.74 --> 1642.40]  his disciples
[1642.40 --> 1643.68]  in the Gospel of John,
[1644.10 --> 1644.92]  he didn't say,
[1645.06 --> 1646.06]  if you become my follower,
[1646.54 --> 1647.16]  you'll no longer
[1647.16 --> 1648.28]  have sadness and suffering.
[1648.28 --> 1650.74]  What he actually said is,
[1651.18 --> 1652.28]  you will suffer
[1652.28 --> 1654.66]  and you will have sadness.
[1657.50 --> 1659.32]  Jesus even blesses
[1659.32 --> 1660.40]  those who mourn.
[1661.56 --> 1662.66]  Get the reference?
[1663.20 --> 1663.86]  Beatitudes.
[1664.90 --> 1666.62]  Blessed are those who mourn
[1666.62 --> 1668.20]  for you shall be comforted.
[1668.58 --> 1669.64]  That's what he teaches.
[1670.60 --> 1672.44]  But not just random,
[1672.72 --> 1674.48]  hopeless mourning and grief,
[1674.48 --> 1676.30]  but mourning
[1676.30 --> 1678.38]  with what God mourns for.
[1679.48 --> 1681.04]  Like how God grieves
[1681.04 --> 1682.70]  for the estranged family members.
[1683.40 --> 1684.70]  Like how God grieves
[1684.70 --> 1685.34]  for refugees
[1685.34 --> 1686.60]  that have lost their homes
[1686.60 --> 1687.82]  or sicknesses
[1687.82 --> 1688.42]  that take away
[1688.42 --> 1689.28]  the beauty of life
[1689.28 --> 1690.02]  as he intended
[1690.02 --> 1690.62]  in the beginning.
[1691.06 --> 1693.46]  Or the broken relationships
[1693.46 --> 1695.22]  and the loss of loved ones.
[1695.54 --> 1697.06]  You will grieve,
[1697.20 --> 1697.82]  Jesus says.
[1698.60 --> 1700.00]  But he continues on.
[1700.10 --> 1700.52]  He says,
[1700.80 --> 1701.44]  your grief
[1701.44 --> 1703.24]  will turn to joy.
[1703.24 --> 1705.90]  So be ministered
[1705.90 --> 1707.08]  by his own words here
[1707.08 --> 1708.26]  from the Gospel of John.
[1709.34 --> 1710.28]  A woman giving birth
[1710.28 --> 1711.70]  to a child has pain
[1711.70 --> 1713.58]  because her time has come.
[1714.38 --> 1715.88]  But when her baby is born,
[1715.98 --> 1717.18]  she forgets the anguish
[1717.18 --> 1718.68]  because of her joy.
[1718.98 --> 1720.44]  Her joy that a child
[1720.44 --> 1721.48]  is born into the world.
[1722.44 --> 1723.70]  So it is with you.
[1724.30 --> 1726.00]  Now is your time of grief.
[1726.70 --> 1728.04]  But I will see you again
[1728.04 --> 1729.86]  and you will rejoice
[1729.86 --> 1732.36]  and no one will take away your joy.
[1732.36 --> 1732.46]  joy.
[1734.76 --> 1736.38]  That's our real joy
[1736.38 --> 1737.20]  in the Lord.
[1738.74 --> 1741.18]  The real Christmas message.
[1741.82 --> 1742.60]  The birth of Jesus.
[1743.94 --> 1745.70]  The unfailing living word
[1745.70 --> 1746.74]  of God himself
[1746.74 --> 1748.84]  who came to dwell with us
[1748.84 --> 1750.06]  in our wilderness.
[1750.70 --> 1751.50]  In our suffering.
[1752.38 --> 1753.40]  He is Emmanuel.
[1754.02 --> 1755.22]  And so hear the invitation
[1755.22 --> 1756.34]  for us this morning, Hope.
[1756.94 --> 1758.12]  God is with you.
[1758.12 --> 1760.32]  So seek the Lord
[1760.32 --> 1761.90]  and turn to his ways
[1761.90 --> 1764.40]  and he will abundantly forgive.
[1765.92 --> 1768.12]  And the more the Spirit guides
[1768.84 --> 1769.62]  and leads us
[1769.62 --> 1770.64]  to be more aligned
[1770.64 --> 1771.34]  with his will,
[1771.92 --> 1774.32]  may you find real joy in him.
[1775.38 --> 1776.82]  And may that be the strength
[1776.82 --> 1777.74]  that you live out
[1777.74 --> 1780.42]  throughout all of your suffering
[1780.42 --> 1781.26]  and darkness.
[1781.94 --> 1784.02]  May the Lord be your source of joy.
[1784.02 --> 1785.02]  May the Lord be your source of joy.
[1785.02 --> 1785.78]  Let's pray.
[1793.10 --> 1794.00]  Loving Father,
[1794.16 --> 1795.22]  we come to you again
[1795.22 --> 1797.98]  and we are able to rejoice
[1797.98 --> 1799.62]  and praise your name
[1799.62 --> 1801.64]  because of who you are
[1801.64 --> 1803.80]  and because of your good will
[1803.80 --> 1804.44]  for us
[1804.44 --> 1805.86]  and for all of creation.
[1807.16 --> 1808.38]  We thank you, Lord,
[1808.46 --> 1810.36]  that it does not depend on us.
[1810.36 --> 1814.26]  It does not depend on our own ways
[1814.26 --> 1815.18]  and our own wisdom
[1815.18 --> 1816.30]  to find real joy.
[1816.58 --> 1818.38]  But you and you alone
[1818.38 --> 1820.38]  are the source of our real joy.
[1821.92 --> 1823.44]  May your Holy Spirit
[1823.44 --> 1825.06]  continue to guide
[1825.06 --> 1826.34]  and strengthen us
[1826.34 --> 1827.62]  in that foundation
[1827.62 --> 1828.48]  that we have in you.
[1829.44 --> 1831.78]  May we find real joy in you
[1831.78 --> 1834.30]  even through all the wilderness
[1834.30 --> 1835.88]  and suffering and brokenness
[1835.88 --> 1836.60]  that we face
[1836.60 --> 1838.18]  in our day-to-day lives.
[1838.18 --> 1842.40]  May you be the source of our joy
[1842.40 --> 1843.70]  and may we praise you
[1843.70 --> 1844.94]  and give you all the glory
[1844.94 --> 1846.20]  that you deserve.
[1847.24 --> 1848.20]  Thank you for coming.
[1849.62 --> 1850.74]  Thank you for promising
[1850.74 --> 1851.78]  that you will come again.
[1853.04 --> 1853.66]  In this,
[1853.84 --> 1854.74]  we put our trust
[1854.74 --> 1855.40]  and our faith.
[1856.66 --> 1856.92]  Amen.
[1858.92 --> 1860.74]  I invite you to stand as we...
