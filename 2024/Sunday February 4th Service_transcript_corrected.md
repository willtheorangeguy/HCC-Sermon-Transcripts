[0.00 → 5.02] James, I appreciated that comment about eating lamb.
[5.46 → 6.84] I grew up on a sheep farm,
[7.52 → 9.98] and so my parents, we want to thank you for eating lamb.
[10.86 → 12.14] Kept our family in business.
[15.02 → 18.92] We're in the third of our series on Galatians.
[19.32 → 22.86] The first two chapters focused on what is the gospel and what it isn't.
[23.32 → 26.62] The second two chapters focused on what does it mean to be part of God's family.
[26.62 → 33.44] And the third section, chapter 5 and 6, is all about how we then live.
[34.06 → 35.88] And I'm pretty excited to preach on this passage
[35.88 → 38.06] because it is all about the power of the Spirit.
[38.78 → 41.90] And so if you have your Bible, turn with me to Galatians chapter 5,
[41.98 → 44.26] and we're going to read verse 13 to the end.
[49.94 → 54.08] You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free.
[54.08 → 58.60] But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature.
[59.26 → 62.02] Rather, serve one another humbly in love.
[62.52 → 65.44] For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command.
[66.34 → 67.72] Love your neighbour as yourself.
[68.42 → 70.86] If you keep on biting and devouring each other,
[70.98 → 73.92] watch out, or you will be destroyed by each other.
[74.82 → 77.58] So I say, walk by the Spirit,
[78.06 → 81.24] and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.
[81.24 → 84.74] For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit,
[84.94 → 87.18] and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature.
[87.68 → 89.46] They are in conflict with each other,
[89.60 → 92.46] so that you are not to do whatever you want.
[93.04 → 94.44] But if you are led by the Spirit,
[95.04 → 96.16] you're not under the law.
[97.00 → 99.34] The acts of the sinful nature are obvious.
[100.06 → 102.90] Sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery,
[103.24 → 104.66] idolatry and witchcraft,
[105.20 → 108.06] hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,
[108.06 → 112.02] selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy,
[112.72 → 114.68] drunkenness, orgies and the like.
[115.26 → 117.04] I warn you, as I did before,
[117.34 → 118.54] that those who live like this
[118.54 → 120.68] will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[121.56 → 124.56] But the fruit of the Spirit is love,
[125.60 → 131.24] joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[132.00 → 135.04] faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[135.04 → 138.50] Against such things there is no law.
[139.24 → 140.56] Those who belong to Christ Jesus
[140.56 → 142.34] have crucified the sinful nature
[142.34 → 144.08] with its passions and desires.
[144.82 → 146.36] And since we live by the Spirit,
[147.28 → 149.10] let us keep in step with the Spirit.
[149.86 → 151.28] Let us not become conceited,
[151.42 → 153.62] provoking, and envying each other.
[158.28 → 159.96] Well, a number of years ago now,
[160.18 → 163.86] I got to know a man who was involved in B.C. Corrections.
[163.86 → 166.68] His job, I did not envy his job one bit,
[166.74 → 169.12] his job was overseeing criminals
[169.12 → 171.18] who had finally finished serving their sentence
[171.18 → 173.76] now being reintegrated into society.
[173.86 → 175.12] It's a very important position.
[175.76 → 177.86] And he would meet with parole officers
[177.86 → 180.02] and halfway houses and community leaders
[180.02 → 182.52] to discern, okay, how does this person
[182.52 → 184.36] who's now served X amount of years
[184.36 → 185.66] at Kent Penitentiary,
[185.96 → 187.24] and where are we going to place them?
[187.30 → 188.18] How are they going to flourish?
[188.32 → 189.92] What are the parameters they need
[189.92 → 192.60] in order to live well back in society?
[193.66 → 195.58] The question he had to ask
[195.58 → 197.36] over and over again is,
[198.18 → 199.32] what's the risk?
[199.86 → 201.12] And perhaps even more deeply,
[201.62 → 204.20] will this person who spent this many years
[204.20 → 207.10] with prison guards and fences and bars,
[207.30 → 209.18] will they actually change
[209.18 → 210.54] and choose a life of freedom,
[210.54 → 213.56], or will they go back to the old habits,
[214.16 → 215.64] the old way of life,
[215.64 → 216.78] and re-offend?
[216.90 → 217.98] What will they do
[217.98 → 219.68] with this new-found freedom?
[221.88 → 224.54] That's the question of Galatians 5.
[225.40 → 226.50] There are these new people
[226.50 → 227.46] who have come to the church,
[227.66 → 229.02] they've got a harsh background,
[229.18 → 229.62] many of them,
[229.68 → 231.52] a tough growing up.
[231.74 → 233.00] They've come to faith in Jesus,
[233.12 → 234.06] they've been set free,
[234.32 → 235.38] and now the question is,
[235.46 → 236.32] what are they going to do
[236.32 → 237.44] with this freedom?
[238.18 → 239.40] Are they going to go back
[239.40 → 240.84] to the old lifestyle they had,
[240.88 → 241.72] are they going to fall back
[241.72 → 242.58] into the old traps,
[242.64 → 244.64], or will they finally flourish?
[244.64 → 247.32] And if so, how?
[249.58 → 250.42] Important background
[250.42 → 251.68] to reading Galatians 5.
[252.28 → 253.44] Up until this point,
[253.52 → 254.50] as you've probably noticed,
[254.64 → 256.18] Paul has been sort of in a debate
[256.18 → 257.84] with these people called the Judaizes,
[258.20 → 259.14] who have been saying
[259.14 → 260.24] to the people in the churches,
[260.76 → 261.58] this Paul guy,
[261.68 → 263.40] he's not taking your faith serious enough,
[263.46 → 265.32] he doesn't take the law serious enough,
[265.56 → 267.12] you need to come under the law,
[267.22 → 268.72] you need to take the law more seriously,
[268.84 → 269.80] it needs to be at the centre.
[270.58 → 271.92] And one of their concerns,
[272.12 → 273.96] I would say a legitimate concern,
[273.96 → 274.90] was this,
[275.74 → 277.06] you've got these new Christians
[277.06 → 278.44] coming into the church,
[278.62 → 280.40] they have a really rough background,
[280.60 → 281.10] some of them,
[281.24 → 282.36] as churches always do,
[282.80 → 285.30] and how will they know how to live
[285.30 → 287.20] if they don't have the law?
[287.30 → 288.32] What's going to curb
[288.32 → 289.76] the destructive desires,
[290.10 → 292.14] their old habits from reappearing,
[292.24 → 293.36] from them going back
[293.36 → 294.56] to what they were before?
[295.56 → 296.80] And you know what Paul's answer is?
[297.02 → 297.90] So powerful.
[297.90 → 298.54] Number one,
[299.42 → 300.28] the old nature
[300.28 → 301.86] has been crucified with Jesus.
[302.32 → 303.18] I mean, that's what we celebrated
[303.18 → 304.76] at Jeb ai's baptism last week.
[305.06 → 305.84] The old nature
[305.84 → 307.34] has been dealt with
[307.34 → 308.32] through the work of Jesus,
[308.48 → 309.18] but secondly,
[309.92 → 311.98] what's going to curb their desires,
[312.28 → 313.32] change their hearts,
[313.82 → 315.00] shift their ambitions,
[315.00 → 317.34] is the power of God
[317.34 → 318.88] through the Holy Spirit.
[321.36 → 322.82] I want us to notice,
[323.18 → 324.84] before we move anywhere else
[324.84 → 325.52] in this passage,
[325.52 → 326.84] how Paul starts.
[326.96 → 327.26] In fact,
[327.60 → 328.76] he makes a repeated point
[328.76 → 329.78] that I don't want us to miss,
[329.86 → 330.34] and that is,
[330.94 → 331.52] ultimately,
[331.84 → 334.78] Christianity will always be about freedom.
[336.04 → 338.00] Christianity is about freedom.
[338.96 → 339.94] It gets misconstrued
[339.94 → 340.72] in all sorts of ways.
[340.78 → 341.52] If you watch Netflix
[341.52 → 342.54] or whatever you watch,
[342.72 → 343.36] you'll know that,
[343.48 → 344.28] culturally speaking,
[344.40 → 345.44] Christianity gets stereotyped
[345.44 → 346.50] in many different ways.
[346.74 → 347.62] It gets mocked
[347.62 → 348.46] in many different ways,
[348.56 → 349.72] sort of the Ned Flanders,
[349.98 → 350.30] you know,
[350.90 → 351.78] if that's an old reference
[351.78 → 353.28] for some of us Simpsons watchers.
[354.46 → 355.50] But Christianity is about
[355.50 → 355.84] freedom.
[356.04 → 356.72] And I want to read
[356.72 → 358.24] verse 1 and verse 13
[358.24 → 360.10] because Paul repeats this point.
[360.68 → 361.84] He says in verse 1,
[363.18 → 364.38] it is for freedom
[364.38 → 366.98] that Christ has set us free.
[367.16 → 367.90] Verse 13,
[368.38 → 369.60] you, my brothers and sisters,
[369.72 → 371.60] were called to be free.
[372.94 → 374.04] And here's my conviction.
[375.00 → 376.74] We're here because we believe that.
[377.38 → 378.32] Or we're here because
[378.32 → 379.62] we're trying to explore that.
[379.80 → 381.10] The reason we go to church,
[381.20 → 382.36] the reason we want to read the Bible
[382.36 → 383.64] is because we have some sense
[383.64 → 384.88] of a life we're living
[384.88 → 385.92] that is not free.
[386.22 → 387.28] And we have some sense
[387.28 → 388.70] of what Jesus has on offer
[388.70 → 389.52] for His world
[389.52 → 391.56] is going to bring life.
[392.24 → 393.22] It's going to bring freedom.
[393.76 → 394.68] That's why we're here.
[397.48 → 398.74] Now, there are two things
[398.74 → 399.54] that we're going to look at
[399.54 → 400.62] this morning in this passage.
[400.74 → 401.62] The first is this.
[402.32 → 403.58] Paul defines freedom
[403.58 → 405.08] in a very important way.
[406.06 → 406.88] Freedom is not to do
[406.88 → 407.44] what you want.
[407.44 → 408.74] Freedom is to serve
[408.74 → 410.72] and love and humility.
[411.52 → 412.06] But secondly,
[412.24 → 413.38] perhaps even more important,
[413.64 → 414.86] if we want to be free
[414.86 → 416.28] and if we want to live free,
[416.36 → 417.66] the only way we can do it
[417.66 → 418.24] is through the work
[418.24 → 418.98] of the Holy Spirit.
[419.12 → 420.34] This will not come from within us.
[420.56 → 421.96] It does not come natural to us.
[422.16 → 423.24] It is a work from without.
[423.40 → 424.82] It's a work from the power of God
[424.82 → 425.58] by His Spirit.
[426.34 → 427.50] So let me read for us again
[427.50 → 428.72] verse 13 and following,
[429.26 → 431.04] and we'll get into this logic
[431.04 → 431.62] of freedom
[431.62 → 432.84] and how we find it.
[433.64 → 434.22] He writes,
[434.22 → 436.02] You, my brothers and sisters,
[436.02 → 437.50] were called to be free,
[438.20 → 439.86] but do not use your freedom
[439.86 → 441.44] to indulge the flesh.
[442.14 → 443.74] Rather, serve one another
[443.74 → 445.92] humbly in love.
[446.50 → 447.12] For the whole,
[447.34 → 448.22] I'll just continue here,
[448.26 → 449.30] for the entire law
[449.30 → 450.42] is fulfilled
[450.42 → 451.68] in keeping this one command,
[452.24 → 454.12] love your neighbour as yourself.
[455.14 → 456.64] But you hear the exhortation, right?
[457.14 → 458.34] You're free now, church.
[458.92 → 460.30] Don't use your freedom
[460.30 → 462.92] to go back to the old sinful nature.
[462.92 → 464.52] Don't use it to indulge
[464.52 → 465.38] the old lifestyle
[465.38 → 467.66] that you got rescued from.
[468.90 → 469.74] And part of the challenge
[469.74 → 470.56] with this word freedom
[470.56 → 472.22] is how we understand it.
[472.24 → 472.98] And I would say then,
[473.08 → 474.08] both then and now,
[474.50 → 475.96] people confuse and misunderstand
[475.96 → 478.12] and mis define
[478.12 → 479.02] what freedom is.
[479.94 → 480.70] You know, it's attached
[480.70 → 481.50] to many movements,
[481.94 → 482.74] many court cases,
[482.92 → 483.58] many protests.
[483.74 → 484.72] We all want freedom,
[484.96 → 486.06] but we don't know what it is.
[486.50 → 487.58] Let me ask you this question.
[488.34 → 489.70] If you had to define it,
[490.18 → 491.36] what would you say freedom is?
[491.84 → 492.90] Someone sort of elbowed you,
[492.92 → 493.46] at work,
[493.54 → 494.22] or in the neighbourhood
[494.22 → 494.46] and said,
[494.52 → 494.86] hey, like,
[494.90 → 496.00] what do you think freedom is?
[496.04 → 497.28] What does it mean to be free?
[497.84 → 498.60] What would you say?
[503.36 → 504.16] I'm guessing,
[504.54 → 505.28] most Canadians,
[505.36 → 506.22] and maybe Christians too,
[507.06 → 508.26] their first default
[508.26 → 509.22] when we think of freedom
[509.22 → 511.08] is freedom from having to do
[511.08 → 512.94] what someone else tells us.
[513.50 → 514.50] Is that what's going through your mind?
[515.72 → 516.68] At least two of us,
[516.72 → 517.20] one of us.
[518.56 → 519.02] Those of us,
[519.08 → 520.00] I'm not saying it now.
[520.40 → 521.52] Or freedom to sort of
[521.52 → 522.84] do whatever we want to do,
[522.90 → 523.06] right?
[523.10 → 523.72] You have a feeling,
[523.84 → 524.36] you have a desire,
[524.46 → 524.90] you have an ambition,
[525.02 → 526.32] you get to do what you want to do.
[526.38 → 526.86] You're free.
[527.34 → 528.60] I think that's the shorthand
[528.60 → 529.54] Canadian definition
[529.54 → 530.52] of freedom.
[531.42 → 532.54] But now I want to ask,
[533.02 → 533.66] is that
[533.66 → 535.34] actually freedom?
[536.82 → 537.98] And it seems to me,
[538.16 → 539.22] you could disagree with me,
[539.30 → 540.36] but that definition of freedom
[540.36 → 541.96] leads to a whole mountain of pain
[541.96 → 543.20] because what we do with freedom
[543.20 → 545.32] is exactly what Paul's concerned about.
[545.32 → 547.72] you're free to go back
[547.72 → 550.50] to the old sinful nature,
[550.88 → 553.36] to gratify all the old desires
[553.36 → 554.30] of the sinful flesh.
[554.66 → 555.64] And I think many of us,
[555.70 → 556.22] if we're honest,
[556.36 → 557.90] we know what I'm about to say
[557.90 → 559.34] too well in our own experience.
[560.80 → 561.52] In Canada,
[561.60 → 562.66] you're free to watch
[562.66 → 563.38] whatever you want.
[564.30 → 565.42] You can eat whatever you want.
[565.60 → 566.66] You can drink whatever you want.
[566.72 → 568.20] You can sleep with whoever you want.
[568.44 → 569.74] You can do with your money
[569.74 → 571.12] and time whatever you want.
[571.22 → 572.08] Very few people
[572.08 → 573.92] are breathing down your neck
[573.92 → 575.10] telling you how you need to do
[575.10 → 576.68] all these different dimensions of life.
[577.28 → 578.34] And it just so happens
[578.34 → 579.60] that in Canada,
[579.72 → 582.28] we have incredible amounts of anxiety.
[583.50 → 584.82] Many of us have trails
[584.82 → 586.04] of broken relationships
[586.04 → 588.44] and broken trust in our lives.
[589.14 → 590.94] Many of us have unhealthy ways
[590.94 → 592.14] we've treated our body
[592.14 → 593.98] and we live with crushing levels of debt.
[594.06 → 595.42] I mean, I just read about this week,
[595.66 → 596.74] how so many Canadians
[596.74 → 597.68] have deep anxiety
[597.68 → 599.12] just about money,
[599.86 → 601.56] even though we're free to do with it
[601.56 → 602.40] whatever we want.
[602.40 → 604.52] Canadian freedom
[604.52 → 606.94] looks a lot like what Paul is saying.
[607.04 → 608.02] Do not use your freedom
[608.02 → 610.90] to indulge in the old self,
[611.72 → 613.38] the desires of the flesh.
[613.44 → 614.54] And what he's saying to the church is,
[614.88 → 617.02] church, you've been freed from that.
[617.46 → 619.34] You don't have to go back to that anymore
[619.34 → 621.12] because of what Jesus has accomplished.
[621.28 → 622.22] This is a very powerful point.
[622.46 → 623.84] You've been rescued from
[623.84 → 625.38] the need to go back
[625.38 → 627.32] to that old way of life.
[628.48 → 629.70] And I want to read for you a quote.
[629.70 → 632.38] This comes from a fellow named William Barclay
[632.38 → 634.14] and he says it very well.
[634.24 → 634.44] He says,
[634.52 → 637.20] Christians are not men and women
[637.20 → 639.44] who have become free to sin,
[640.18 → 642.30] but people who, by the grace of God,
[642.34 → 645.32] have become free not to sin.
[645.98 → 646.82] You hear what he's saying there?
[647.30 → 648.76] You've been freed from the need
[648.76 → 651.82] to go back to old enslaving habits,
[652.60 → 654.40] to old enslaving things
[654.40 → 655.50] that are taking hold of you,
[655.62 → 656.42] giving you shame,
[656.80 → 658.16] making you feel stuck.
[658.16 → 660.98] He's like, you've been rescued from it
[660.98 → 662.54] through the work of Jesus.
[663.32 → 665.22] You're actually free.
[666.80 → 668.80] And now we get Paul's definition of freedom.
[670.72 → 671.90] Paul's definition of freedom
[671.90 → 673.14] is abundantly clear.
[673.24 → 673.78] He says,
[674.24 → 677.02] serve one another humbly in love.
[677.54 → 678.88] That's freedom for the Christian.
[679.74 → 683.08] Serve one another humbly in love.
[684.12 → 685.84] That sounds a lot like Jesus, doesn't it?
[685.84 → 687.42] And it's interesting to me,
[687.56 → 688.76] I also have a hunch
[688.76 → 691.08] that most of us have some sense
[691.08 → 692.22] of what that feels like.
[693.46 → 695.18] Perhaps if you think about your life
[695.18 → 697.10] or maybe I'll just throw some scenarios out there,
[697.54 → 699.84] you serve as part of our Wednesday night crew
[699.84 → 701.24] at the Coverdale Community Kitchen
[701.24 → 702.92] and you get to make meals
[702.92 → 704.46] and sit down with and share meals
[704.46 → 705.50] with our vulnerable neighbours
[705.50 → 706.86] who are struggling to find a home
[706.86 → 709.18] and you feel free doing it.
[709.70 → 711.16] Or perhaps you've got a family member
[711.16 → 711.90] going through addiction
[711.90 → 713.16] and they're staying in your home
[713.16 → 714.02] and you're helping them out,
[714.10 → 715.14] you're doing what you need to do,
[715.24 → 716.06] opening up space,
[716.26 → 717.28] and you just know that
[717.28 → 718.64] in this act of caring for them,
[718.98 → 720.30] it's making you feel free.
[720.94 → 722.26] Or perhaps you're being generous
[722.26 → 722.76] with your money
[722.76 → 723.96] towards a cause that matters
[723.96 → 724.98] deeply to your family
[724.98 → 726.20] and you know that that money
[726.20 → 728.70] is best spent in that
[728.70 → 729.62] rather than whatever you want
[729.62 → 730.44] to buy for yourself.
[730.78 → 731.58] And somehow,
[732.18 → 733.08] does this resonate with you?
[733.14 → 734.60] Somehow as you give yourself away,
[734.84 → 736.18] as you serve in humility,
[736.30 → 737.60] as you try to love your neighbour,
[737.92 → 739.18] you become more human.
[739.98 → 741.94] You become more fully alive.
[742.64 → 745.46] You become what you were created for,
[746.10 → 748.72] to serve in humility with love.
[749.92 → 750.66] Walter Brueggemann,
[751.42 → 751.88] New Testament,
[752.00 → 753.20] actually Old Testament theologian,
[753.24 → 753.90] he puts it this way,
[753.94 → 754.06] he says,
[754.12 → 755.52] when you give your life away
[755.52 → 756.48] in humble service,
[756.98 → 758.50] you get it back enhanced.
[759.20 → 759.92] Have you felt that before?
[760.22 → 761.76] You give your life away
[761.76 → 762.46] to serve others
[762.46 → 763.54] and somehow you become
[763.54 → 765.78] more fully human in the process.
[765.78 → 768.24] You feel the life of Jesus
[768.24 → 769.34] in your own life.
[770.88 → 772.28] But here's the main point now.
[772.40 → 773.60] I want to underscore this one
[773.60 → 774.72] because this is what Paul says.
[775.08 → 776.90] It is not enough just to know
[776.90 → 778.40] Paul's definition of freedom.
[779.06 → 780.30] It's not enough to have in your head,
[780.38 → 781.04] hey Dave, okay,
[781.30 → 782.80] I now know that to be free
[782.80 → 783.90] is to serve with humility
[783.90 → 784.68] and to love others.
[784.94 → 785.36] There we go,
[785.40 → 785.96] I'm going to do it.
[786.60 → 788.08] It's very likely the case
[788.08 → 789.00] that you just like me
[789.00 → 790.02] will go home from church,
[790.10 → 790.96] will have this definition
[790.96 → 791.56] in our heads,
[791.68 → 793.02] and we'll probably still be
[793.02 → 794.48] very tempted to go back
[794.48 → 795.24] to the old habits
[795.24 → 796.44] of watching whatever we want,
[796.68 → 797.68] eating whatever we want,
[797.92 → 798.68] wasting time
[798.68 → 799.70] in very unproductive ways
[799.70 → 800.64] and not actually loving
[800.64 → 801.64] and serving our neighbours.
[802.78 → 803.66] What's needed,
[804.32 → 805.70] according to Galatians 5,
[806.50 → 807.96] is the power of the Holy Spirit.
[809.14 → 810.06] What is needed
[810.06 → 812.26] is something beyond ourselves
[812.26 → 814.66] to change our sinful nature,
[815.22 → 816.52] and that is the Holy Spirit.
[817.70 → 819.04] Now, if you've been reading
[819.04 → 819.92] Galatians carefully,
[820.50 → 821.74] you will probably have noticed
[821.74 → 822.34] that the Spirit
[822.34 → 823.70] has showed up a lot already,
[823.70 → 825.50] and we haven't focused on it yet
[825.50 → 826.40] because there's just so many
[826.40 → 827.28] other things that Paul
[827.28 → 828.58] is trying to say in Galatians.
[828.82 → 829.64] But let me give us
[829.64 → 831.12] just a really brief summary
[831.12 → 832.44] of what Paul has already said
[832.44 → 832.94] in Galatians
[832.94 → 834.32] about the Holy Spirit.
[835.14 → 835.76] Number one,
[836.70 → 838.54] Christians receive the Holy Spirit
[838.54 → 841.24] at the time of their conversion.
[842.66 → 844.46] The moment you came to faith,
[845.32 → 846.24] the Spirit of God
[846.24 → 847.26] was operative in your life.
[847.28 → 847.68] And I would say,
[847.74 → 848.70] even mysteriously,
[849.16 → 850.04] wonderfully,
[850.24 → 851.06] even before that,
[851.06 → 852.80] creating in you this desire,
[852.94 → 853.50] this ambition,
[853.64 → 854.36] this intent
[854.36 → 855.30] to sort of know
[855.30 → 855.88] what you believe
[855.88 → 856.84] and why you exist.
[857.14 → 857.98] And when you come to faith,
[858.04 → 858.36] you could say,
[858.42 → 858.92] praise the Lord,
[858.98 → 859.86] the Spirit of God
[859.86 → 861.18] is at work in me.
[861.52 → 862.48] You do not need to doubt it.
[862.56 → 863.00] Number two,
[863.64 → 864.94] the plan from the beginning,
[865.12 → 866.62] according to Galatians 3, 14,
[866.68 → 867.10] and following,
[867.36 → 868.32] was that the nations
[868.32 → 869.08] around the world
[869.08 → 870.78] would come to faith in Jesus
[870.78 → 872.16] and receive the power
[872.16 → 873.04] of the Holy Spirit,
[873.26 → 874.42] and communities
[874.42 → 875.98] would live and move
[875.98 → 877.06] and follow the leading
[877.06 → 878.24] of God's Spirit.
[878.24 → 880.32] Thirdly,
[881.38 → 882.46] as Jonathan preached
[882.46 → 883.26] on last week,
[883.84 → 885.02] the Holy Spirit
[885.02 → 888.12] enables us to call God Dad,
[888.86 → 889.10] right?
[889.16 → 889.98] In Galatians 4,
[890.64 → 891.38] 4 to 7,
[891.82 → 892.78] it's Abba, Father,
[892.86 → 893.32] that language
[893.32 → 894.14] that comes from us.
[894.20 → 894.68] That is because
[894.68 → 896.30] the Spirit enables us
[896.30 → 897.40] to have this intimate
[897.40 → 898.50] relationship with the Father.
[898.60 → 899.64] It's not natural to us
[899.64 → 900.18] in our rebellion.
[900.46 → 901.10] It's the Spirit
[901.10 → 902.54] who brings us back
[902.54 → 903.70] into a relationship
[903.70 → 904.30] with our Father
[904.30 → 905.14] who loves us.
[905.60 → 906.10] And finally,
[906.18 → 906.66] this is what we're
[906.66 → 907.56] going to focus on today.
[907.56 → 909.20] It is the Spirit
[909.20 → 911.04] that enables us
[911.04 → 912.68] to have victory
[912.68 → 914.80] over our sinful flesh,
[915.32 → 916.34] the old self,
[916.74 → 917.72] the old desires
[917.72 → 918.62] that enslave us,
[918.72 → 919.94] and then it is the Spirit
[919.94 → 921.20] that produces in us
[921.20 → 923.02] the fruit of love,
[923.30 → 924.32] joy, peace,
[924.82 → 925.70] patience, kindness,
[925.92 → 926.38] goodness,
[927.06 → 927.54] gentleness,
[927.88 → 928.76] and self-control.
[932.06 → 934.12] Jonathan mentioned last week
[934.12 → 935.58] I think something very profound
[935.58 → 936.40] that I want to repeat.
[936.40 → 937.74] He said it's important
[937.74 → 938.14] that we know
[938.14 → 939.00] that when Jesus came
[939.00 → 939.96] and defeated death
[939.96 → 941.02] and sin and Satan,
[941.02 → 942.12] he went through the grave
[942.12 → 943.22] into resurrection life.
[943.42 → 944.46] He didn't look at the church
[944.46 → 944.76] and say,
[944.86 → 945.44] all right people,
[946.40 → 947.04] go get them.
[947.42 → 948.72] I'm going off to the Father.
[949.08 → 950.02] You've got this.
[950.84 → 951.14] No,
[951.24 → 951.94] what he said is,
[952.34 → 953.42] you're going to need me.
[954.28 → 955.58] You're going to need my power.
[955.84 → 957.02] And I'm actually delighted
[957.02 → 958.10] to go back to the Father
[958.10 → 958.78] because I know
[958.78 → 959.82] you are receiving
[959.82 → 960.84] the Holy Spirit
[960.84 → 962.62] which is the very same power
[962.62 → 964.08] that rose him from the dead
[964.08 → 965.50] that is now poured out
[965.50 → 966.58] in the hearts of believers
[966.58 → 967.98] in the communities
[967.98 → 968.96] of faith in Jesus.
[970.52 → 971.68] And so I want to read for you
[971.68 → 973.22] my favourite verse
[973.22 → 973.94] in this passage
[973.94 → 975.04] and it was hard to pick,
[975.14 → 975.82] I will admit.
[976.36 → 977.26] Verse 16,
[979.00 → 979.70] Paul writes,
[979.82 → 980.60] so I say,
[981.46 → 982.52] walk by the Spirit
[982.52 → 986.08] and you will not gratify
[986.60 → 988.28] the desires of the flesh.
[989.74 → 990.98] Here's my question, church.
[992.42 → 993.76] Do you believe this?
[995.54 → 996.72] I was saying to the staff
[996.72 → 997.06] this week
[997.06 → 998.00] when I was working on my sermon,
[998.06 → 998.98] I think this is my sermon
[998.98 → 999.86] in a nutshell right here.
[1000.16 → 1000.94] This powerful,
[1001.14 → 1001.52] beautiful,
[1001.76 → 1002.42] amazing thing
[1002.42 → 1003.04] that Paul says
[1003.04 → 1003.54] that I'm going to ask,
[1003.90 → 1005.94] do we truly believe this?
[1006.66 → 1007.58] And I'm going to sharpen
[1007.58 → 1008.34] my point here.
[1008.40 → 1009.26] I'll put verse 19
[1009.26 → 1010.34] on the screen
[1010.34 → 1011.96] and I want to just continue
[1011.96 → 1012.60] to contrast
[1012.60 → 1013.46] what Paul is saying
[1013.46 → 1014.86] because this is what he's saying.
[1014.86 → 1016.10] So I say,
[1016.56 → 1017.34] walk by the Spirit
[1017.34 → 1019.72] and you will not fall prey
[1019.72 → 1021.26] to sexual immorality
[1021.26 → 1022.02] and impurity.
[1022.68 → 1023.40] So I say,
[1023.54 → 1024.56] walk by the Spirit
[1024.56 → 1026.54] and you will not become people
[1026.54 → 1027.60] who are idolatrous,
[1028.20 → 1028.82] hateful,
[1029.34 → 1029.98] descending,
[1030.80 → 1031.82] causing division,
[1032.36 → 1032.88] and envious.
[1033.70 → 1034.32] So I say,
[1034.42 → 1035.32] walk by the Spirit
[1035.32 → 1036.28] and you will not be
[1036.28 → 1037.38] an angry person.
[1039.14 → 1039.82] I say,
[1039.90 → 1040.74] walk by the Spirit
[1040.74 → 1043.12] and you will not gratify
[1043.12 → 1044.36] the desires of the flesh.
[1044.36 → 1044.98] So church,
[1045.44 → 1046.72] do you believe this?
[1047.72 → 1047.96] I mean,
[1048.00 → 1049.04] this passage is so important.
[1049.12 → 1049.94] I hope it works its way
[1049.94 → 1050.62] into your minds,
[1050.70 → 1051.32] your imaginations,
[1051.42 → 1051.90] and your hearts,
[1052.06 → 1052.98] the way it's been working
[1052.98 → 1053.40] into mind
[1053.40 → 1054.54] because it is so powerful
[1054.54 → 1055.46] we have to ask ourselves,
[1055.68 → 1056.54] do we really believe
[1056.54 → 1057.26] that this is true?
[1057.40 → 1058.62] That when God's Spirit
[1058.62 → 1059.96] takes hold of our lives,
[1060.06 → 1061.76] it will actually change
[1061.76 → 1062.72] these old habits
[1062.72 → 1064.24] and create new desires
[1064.24 → 1066.50] as a result of God's power.
[1068.84 → 1069.24] Now,
[1069.40 → 1070.80] I'm just going to be forthright
[1070.80 → 1071.70] about my own upbringing.
[1071.80 → 1072.32] I grew up
[1072.32 → 1073.26] in the Reformed tradition.
[1074.46 → 1075.34] And we didn't talk
[1075.34 → 1076.16] a lot about the Spirit.
[1076.84 → 1077.06] In fact,
[1077.10 → 1077.70] there are several people
[1077.70 → 1078.98] even here today
[1078.98 → 1080.46] who have grown up
[1080.46 → 1081.50] in charismatic traditions
[1081.50 → 1082.28] who have said to me
[1082.28 → 1083.04] and other people
[1083.04 → 1083.68] who preach at Hope,
[1083.74 → 1083.94] they're like,
[1083.98 → 1084.72] you guys don't preach
[1084.72 → 1085.84] on the Spirit very much.
[1086.36 → 1087.22] And ouch,
[1087.92 → 1088.72] we're going to preach
[1088.72 → 1089.68] on that after Easter,
[1090.02 → 1090.82] message received.
[1090.94 → 1091.32] Don't worry,
[1091.36 → 1091.78] we're going to talk
[1091.78 → 1092.60] about spiritual gifts,
[1093.02 → 1093.80] spiritual power,
[1093.90 → 1094.60] a lot of different things
[1094.60 → 1095.22] around the Spirit.
[1095.36 → 1095.92] That's coming.
[1096.34 → 1096.80] But today,
[1096.86 → 1097.40] we get to talk
[1097.40 → 1098.46] about the Spirit as well.
[1099.42 → 1100.68] It's not common for me
[1100.68 → 1101.46] to use language
[1101.46 → 1102.64] of walking in the Spirit,
[1103.34 → 1104.20] keeping in step
[1104.20 → 1104.80] with the Spirit,
[1105.02 → 1105.54] and that's part
[1105.54 → 1106.02] of my upbringing,
[1106.14 → 1106.58] maybe it's part
[1106.58 → 1107.40] of yours as well.
[1107.56 → 1108.56] So we want to unpack
[1108.56 → 1109.76] what in the world
[1109.76 → 1110.54] it means
[1110.54 → 1112.50] to walk in step
[1112.50 → 1113.76] with the Spirit.
[1115.22 → 1115.48] Now,
[1115.48 → 1116.26] I first want to share
[1116.26 → 1116.72] a story.
[1117.32 → 1118.18] This comes from a book
[1118.18 → 1118.68] I was reading
[1118.68 → 1119.16] in preparation
[1119.16 → 1119.90] for this sermon.
[1120.60 → 1121.36] I think it'll be helpful
[1121.36 → 1122.42] to discern this together.
[1123.32 → 1124.56] The writer tells the story
[1124.56 → 1125.60] of going whale watching
[1125.60 → 1126.62] and then relates
[1126.62 → 1127.74] this story of whale watching
[1127.74 → 1128.72] to our relationship
[1128.72 → 1129.54] to the Holy Spirit.
[1129.64 → 1130.40] So let me explain.
[1131.24 → 1131.94] He tells the story
[1131.94 → 1133.16] of going off the coast
[1133.16 → 1133.88] of Newfoundland
[1133.88 → 1135.72] on this giant vessel
[1135.72 → 1136.56] and then they go out
[1136.56 → 1137.12] into the ocean
[1137.12 → 1137.74] to whale watch.
[1137.80 → 1138.04] I'm curious,
[1138.10 → 1138.58] how many of us
[1138.58 → 1139.44] have gone whale watching?
[1140.08 → 1140.54] Oh man,
[1140.56 → 1141.58] I'm so jealous.
[1142.06 → 1142.86] I'm hoping that day
[1142.86 → 1143.22] will come.
[1143.30 → 1144.06] I'm actually secretly
[1144.06 → 1144.84] waiting for my parents
[1144.84 → 1145.54] to come into town
[1145.54 → 1146.64] and offer to pay for it.
[1146.82 → 1147.70] That's a different story.
[1149.70 → 1151.02] So they get on this vessel
[1151.02 → 1152.32] and they're driving out
[1152.32 → 1152.76] to the ocean.
[1152.86 → 1153.76] It's a fairly large group
[1153.76 → 1154.26] and the guy's
[1154.26 → 1154.90] with his family.
[1155.26 → 1155.98] He's feeling like
[1155.98 → 1156.96] it's the trip of his lifetime
[1156.96 → 1158.56] and it takes a long time
[1158.56 → 1159.28] to get out there.
[1159.52 → 1160.46] There's a lot of waiting
[1160.46 → 1161.54] and looking in the ocean
[1161.54 → 1162.54] trying to find whales
[1162.54 → 1163.32] or if it's a wave
[1163.32 → 1163.94] and not a whale.
[1164.36 → 1165.44] And after a while,
[1165.92 → 1166.90] some people go down
[1166.90 → 1167.58] below deck,
[1167.72 → 1168.76] including his kids.
[1168.98 → 1169.58] And one of them,
[1169.66 → 1170.38] I won't say which,
[1170.46 → 1171.64] was on a screen
[1171.64 → 1173.12] scrolling through their phone.
[1173.60 → 1174.68] I'm not jealous, you know.
[1175.26 → 1176.16] And then, you know,
[1176.22 → 1177.14] more time passes,
[1177.24 → 1178.16] they go out into the ocean
[1178.16 → 1179.76] and then some other people
[1179.76 → 1180.46] who are by the deck
[1180.46 → 1181.44] move to the middle of the boat
[1181.44 → 1182.70] where there's this glass enclosure
[1182.70 → 1183.66] and they can just sit down
[1183.66 → 1184.36] because they've been standing
[1184.36 → 1184.88] for a while.
[1185.34 → 1186.20] And then there's another group
[1186.20 → 1187.56] of people who are holding
[1187.56 → 1188.48] on to that railing.
[1188.54 → 1188.82] They're like,
[1188.86 → 1189.58] we paid good money
[1189.58 → 1190.92] to be on this whale watching tour.
[1191.16 → 1192.66] We're not going to miss this whale.
[1192.78 → 1193.56] We're going to wait
[1193.56 → 1194.54] and see for this thing
[1194.54 → 1195.10] to show up.
[1196.54 → 1197.44] Well, their moment came.
[1197.44 → 1199.22] And they had their,
[1199.32 → 1200.00] what you might call
[1200.00 → 1201.42] National Geographic moment
[1201.42 → 1202.12] because a whale,
[1202.32 → 1203.70] bigger than the boat itself,
[1203.86 → 1205.28] breached right beside the boat,
[1205.64 → 1207.34] launched itself up into the air
[1207.34 → 1208.52] right beside them.
[1208.70 → 1209.98] And as it was going down,
[1210.04 → 1210.94] it turned sideways,
[1211.14 → 1211.74] coming down,
[1211.90 → 1213.22] and then soaked
[1213.22 → 1214.60] all the people
[1214.60 → 1215.58] on the side of the boat,
[1215.64 → 1216.54] not just with water,
[1216.94 → 1217.70] but mucus.
[1218.20 → 1219.20] They were drenched.
[1221.04 → 1221.96] But here's the thing.
[1222.22 → 1223.40] Not everyone who was on that boat
[1223.40 → 1224.40] had the same experience.
[1224.84 → 1225.60] Those below deck
[1225.60 → 1226.46] felt the waves.
[1226.54 → 1227.66] They knew something was happening.
[1228.08 → 1228.90] Those in the middle
[1228.90 → 1229.80] were behind glass,
[1229.88 → 1230.64] maybe got a photo,
[1230.76 → 1231.20] and the people
[1231.20 → 1232.08] on the side of the boat,
[1232.08 → 1233.52] they got drenched.
[1234.00 → 1235.16] And we'll never forget it.
[1236.78 → 1237.86] Here's how he relates it
[1237.86 → 1238.40] to the Spirit.
[1239.32 → 1239.74] He says,
[1239.88 → 1241.30] many of us in the church
[1241.30 → 1243.48] have a differing relationship
[1243.48 → 1244.34] with the person
[1244.34 → 1245.14] of the Holy Spirit.
[1245.36 → 1246.58] Some of us are below deck.
[1246.68 → 1247.04] We're sort of
[1247.04 → 1248.04] at a comfortable distance,
[1248.12 → 1249.56] and we're not too upset
[1249.56 → 1250.06] about that.
[1250.44 → 1251.66] Some of us are above deck,
[1251.70 → 1252.28] but we're behind
[1252.28 → 1253.28] the glass enclosure,
[1253.48 → 1253.68] you know,
[1253.68 → 1254.66] open but cautious.
[1255.50 → 1256.62] And then there are those of us
[1256.62 → 1258.08] who have our arms and hands
[1258.08 → 1259.94] latched to the side railing,
[1260.00 → 1260.50] and we say,
[1260.50 → 1262.44] we want to be soaked
[1262.44 → 1264.22] in the power
[1264.22 → 1265.64] and the presence
[1265.64 → 1267.00] of the Holy Spirit.
[1267.74 → 1268.98] We're not going below deck.
[1269.52 → 1270.30] We're not going to go
[1270.30 → 1271.12] behind the glass.
[1271.50 → 1272.12] We are waiting
[1272.12 → 1273.62] until something happens
[1273.62 → 1275.36] because we are expectant
[1275.36 → 1276.36] that that whale
[1276.36 → 1277.24] is going to show up.
[1278.38 → 1279.12] And church,
[1279.76 → 1281.90] the whale will show up.
[1282.44 → 1283.86] The Spirit has been given
[1283.86 → 1284.64] to the church.
[1285.14 → 1286.02] And I want to ask you
[1286.02 → 1287.28] the hard question perhaps,
[1287.58 → 1288.08] and that is,
[1288.14 → 1289.00] if you were on the boat
[1289.00 → 1290.06] as you imagine yourself
[1290.06 → 1290.84] in this story,
[1291.16 → 1292.68] where are you on that boat?
[1294.06 → 1295.26] I will say honestly
[1295.26 → 1296.44] that for the vast majority
[1296.44 → 1297.12] of my life,
[1297.40 → 1298.78] I was very comfortable
[1298.78 → 1300.54] staying below deck.
[1301.62 → 1302.82] And I had people in my life
[1302.82 → 1303.78] who were very suspicious
[1303.78 → 1305.66] of charismatic traditions,
[1305.84 → 1306.64] suspicious of how people
[1306.64 → 1307.34] talked about the Spirit.
[1307.44 → 1308.12] I get that.
[1308.46 → 1309.50] But I had many,
[1309.64 → 1310.42] many years of saying,
[1310.48 → 1311.26] I don't know what's going on
[1311.26 → 1311.76] with that Spirit,
[1311.82 → 1313.14] but I'm comfortable below deck.
[1313.50 → 1314.08] And I have people
[1314.08 → 1314.96] in our church today
[1314.96 → 1315.66] who were saying to Dave,
[1315.88 → 1317.20] this is what it might look like
[1317.20 → 1317.86] to have your hands
[1317.86 → 1318.44] on the railing.
[1318.58 → 1319.64] And you're going to love it
[1319.64 → 1320.52] when you get soaked
[1320.52 → 1321.64] by the power of that whale.
[1325.50 → 1326.28] I'm convinced
[1326.28 → 1327.46] that when Paul says,
[1327.86 → 1328.62] walk by the Spirit,
[1329.54 → 1330.68] what he's saying
[1330.68 → 1331.98] to every single believer
[1331.98 → 1333.48] is surrender.
[1335.44 → 1336.28] I'm convinced
[1336.28 → 1337.12] that when he says,
[1337.38 → 1337.86] keep in step
[1337.86 → 1338.50] with the Spirit,
[1338.96 → 1340.34] he's inviting every believer
[1340.34 → 1341.72] to hold out their ambitions,
[1342.10 → 1342.68] their intentions,
[1342.90 → 1344.22] their desires for their life,
[1344.36 → 1344.86] and say,
[1344.96 → 1345.74] not my will,
[1345.74 → 1347.84] but your will be done, Lord.
[1348.58 → 1349.82] You get to lead.
[1350.54 → 1351.72] I get to follow.
[1352.22 → 1353.18] That's, by the way,
[1353.46 → 1354.62] exactly with the language
[1354.62 → 1355.94] of keeping in step.
[1356.18 → 1357.50] You are not setting the pace.
[1357.80 → 1358.46] You are not the one
[1358.46 → 1359.12] leading the way.
[1359.38 → 1360.56] You are following the way
[1360.56 → 1361.26] of our God
[1361.26 → 1363.02] who lives within us
[1363.02 → 1364.28] and leads the church
[1364.28 → 1365.66] by his Spirit.
[1366.86 → 1367.84] So walking in step
[1367.84 → 1368.42] with the Spirit
[1368.42 → 1369.82] is surrendering.
[1370.28 → 1372.28] And that is a lifetime project,
[1372.38 → 1372.80] by the way.
[1373.16 → 1373.88] At least it is
[1373.88 → 1374.94] in my own experience.
[1374.94 → 1376.42] It is a daily sense
[1376.42 → 1378.00] of loosening the grip
[1378.00 → 1379.06] we have on our lives,
[1379.48 → 1380.60] loosening our desire
[1380.60 → 1381.62] to be in control
[1381.62 → 1382.08] and saying,
[1382.20 → 1383.50] Lord, I trust you
[1383.50 → 1384.84] and I need your Spirit
[1384.84 → 1385.60] to lead me
[1385.60 → 1386.52] because on my own
[1386.52 → 1387.60] I will hold control
[1387.60 → 1388.76] and I'll probably run
[1388.76 → 1389.98] this ship into the ground
[1389.98 → 1391.32] to borrow another
[1391.32 → 1392.00] boating metaphor.
[1394.98 → 1396.94] The door that opens
[1396.94 → 1399.30] the work of the Spirit
[1399.30 → 1401.06] is prayer.
[1402.28 → 1403.16] And that's not just
[1403.16 → 1403.82] my opinion.
[1404.46 → 1405.48] This is the Scriptures.
[1406.42 → 1407.70] If I had more time,
[1407.70 → 1408.62] I would walk us
[1408.62 → 1409.50] through all the passages
[1409.50 → 1410.90] in the Gospel accounts
[1410.90 → 1413.08] that narrate Jesus' own life.
[1413.54 → 1414.48] Jesus in Matthew
[1414.48 → 1416.02] and especially in Luke.
[1416.10 → 1417.00] Luke is always
[1417.00 → 1417.70] pointing this out.
[1418.02 → 1418.94] He sees the crowds.
[1419.12 → 1419.94] He sees the demands
[1419.94 → 1420.52] of his disciples.
[1420.64 → 1421.46] He sees the needs
[1421.46 → 1421.96] of the city.
[1422.22 → 1422.96] And he's constantly
[1422.96 → 1424.04] retreating
[1424.04 → 1425.86] to the mountainside
[1425.86 → 1426.38] to what?
[1427.56 → 1428.14] To pray.
[1428.98 → 1430.54] Now, if Jesus needs prayer,
[1430.54 → 1431.66] perhaps we do too.
[1432.12 → 1432.62] In fact, one of my
[1432.62 → 1433.08] favourite stories,
[1433.14 → 1433.80] I didn't even check
[1433.80 → 1434.50] between services.
[1434.66 → 1435.46] I said this boldly
[1435.46 → 1435.92] in the 9 a.m.
[1435.92 → 1437.14] I think it's Matthew 14.
[1437.54 → 1438.60] It's the story of Jesus
[1438.60 → 1439.60] walking on the water.
[1439.86 → 1440.86] And we often miss
[1440.86 → 1442.08] the story right before that.
[1442.14 → 1442.56] You know what Jesus
[1442.56 → 1443.48] is doing right before
[1443.48 → 1444.26] he walks in the water?
[1444.94 → 1446.24] He's on the mountainside
[1446.24 → 1446.60] praying.
[1447.24 → 1448.62] And Jesus is so filled
[1448.62 → 1449.84] with the Spirit of God
[1449.84 → 1450.84] after he prays,
[1450.92 → 1452.24] he's walking on water
[1452.24 → 1453.06] and his disciples are like,
[1453.12 → 1454.04] how does he do this?
[1454.20 → 1455.26] And Matthew is very
[1455.26 → 1455.98] intentional to say
[1455.98 → 1456.94] it goes from the mountain
[1456.94 → 1457.46] of prayer
[1457.46 → 1459.08] to the walking on water.
[1459.72 → 1460.80] That comes from
[1460.80 → 1461.40] the empowerment
[1461.40 → 1462.12] of the Spirit.
[1463.16 → 1463.50] And church,
[1463.58 → 1464.02] let me say this
[1464.02 → 1464.74] even more clearly.
[1464.86 → 1466.08] What's available to Jesus
[1466.08 → 1468.00] is available to us.
[1469.24 → 1470.52] Jesus was not upset
[1470.52 → 1471.58] by him going to be
[1471.58 → 1472.02] with the Father
[1472.02 → 1472.54] because he knew
[1472.54 → 1473.22] the Spirit
[1473.22 → 1474.98] would lead the church.
[1475.50 → 1476.26] And the door
[1476.26 → 1477.38] to the life of the Spirit
[1477.38 → 1478.88] is prayer.
[1480.74 → 1481.60] This power
[1481.60 → 1482.90] is not separated
[1482.90 → 1483.66] and given
[1483.66 → 1484.32] just to people
[1484.32 → 1485.34] who work for the church,
[1485.72 → 1486.68] just missionaries,
[1486.68 → 1487.70] Bible translators
[1487.70 → 1488.34] and pastors.
[1489.06 → 1489.82] The gift of the Spirit
[1489.82 → 1490.88] is for all of us
[1490.88 → 1492.16] all the time
[1492.16 → 1493.40] in whatever mess
[1493.40 → 1494.10] you're going through
[1494.10 → 1495.16] in your life right now.
[1495.40 → 1496.18] Do you believe that?
[1497.06 → 1498.24] The Spirit of God
[1498.24 → 1499.00] is ours
[1499.00 → 1500.22] for the receiving.
[1501.24 → 1502.12] It's ours
[1502.12 → 1503.28] for the transforming.
[1504.40 → 1505.16] And the Spirit
[1505.16 → 1506.28] is after
[1506.28 → 1507.52] our freedom.
[1509.00 → 1509.76] I'm struck by how
[1509.76 → 1510.72] in Jesus' own ministry
[1510.72 → 1512.12] as he comes out
[1512.12 → 1513.02] of his time of prayer
[1513.02 → 1514.28] on the side of the mountain
[1514.28 → 1515.52] often with his disciples,
[1515.52 → 1517.16] he has the ability
[1517.16 → 1518.36] by the Spirit's leading
[1518.36 → 1519.76] to love
[1519.76 → 1520.76] and serve in humility,
[1520.98 → 1522.04] to resist the temptation
[1522.04 → 1522.60] of Satan,
[1522.80 → 1524.12] to know what's most important
[1524.12 → 1524.78] and what isn't,
[1524.92 → 1526.04] and to go into the cities
[1526.04 → 1527.24] proclaiming the kingdom of God
[1527.24 → 1528.08] in humility
[1528.08 → 1529.26] and love.
[1529.38 → 1530.20] And again, church,
[1530.66 → 1531.70] that same power
[1531.70 → 1532.44] is available
[1532.44 → 1533.76] to us.
[1534.40 → 1535.06] To resist
[1535.06 → 1536.10] the temptation of Satan
[1536.10 → 1537.14] however it shows up
[1537.14 → 1537.70] in our life,
[1537.86 → 1539.82] to resist the incredible pull
[1539.82 → 1541.12] of the old sinful nature
[1541.12 → 1542.44] which is still operative
[1542.44 → 1543.00] in our life,
[1543.00 → 1543.94] and say yes
[1543.94 → 1544.74] to the way of Christ
[1544.74 → 1545.52] which is obedience,
[1546.64 → 1547.46] self-denial,
[1547.92 → 1548.76] and humble service
[1548.76 → 1549.24] and love.
[1549.86 → 1550.60] That power
[1550.60 → 1551.94] is for all of us.
[1556.00 → 1557.32] I want to loop back
[1557.32 → 1559.40] to the big picture
[1559.40 → 1560.20] of Galatians 5
[1560.20 → 1560.82] and just allow you
[1560.82 → 1561.58] to marvel with me
[1561.58 → 1562.50] at what Paul is saying.
[1563.12 → 1563.52] He's saying,
[1563.76 → 1564.28] the solution
[1564.28 → 1565.32] to the division
[1565.32 → 1566.10] in the church
[1566.10 → 1567.40] between Judaizes
[1567.40 → 1568.16] and new converts
[1568.16 → 1568.88] and others,
[1569.36 → 1570.40] and the solution
[1570.40 → 1571.58] to the temptation
[1571.58 → 1572.38] of going back
[1572.38 → 1573.48] to the old patterns
[1573.48 → 1573.92] of life
[1573.92 → 1574.94] before we were believers
[1574.94 → 1576.46] and the way
[1576.46 → 1577.16] we experience
[1577.16 → 1577.88] serving in love
[1577.88 → 1578.40] and humility
[1578.40 → 1580.04] is the Spirit.
[1581.92 → 1582.66] And the door
[1582.66 → 1583.72] to experiencing
[1583.72 → 1585.02] the power of the Spirit
[1585.02 → 1586.86] is prayer.
[1588.38 → 1589.22] Now I don't have this
[1589.22 → 1589.74] on the slides
[1589.74 → 1590.88] but I want to read for you.
[1591.62 → 1592.54] This comes from
[1592.54 → 1593.88] the Heidelberg Catechism.
[1594.00 → 1594.92] It's a teaching document
[1594.92 → 1595.66] in our church
[1595.66 → 1596.94] and there's a question
[1596.94 → 1597.20] in there.
[1597.48 → 1598.84] The whole Heidelberg Catechism
[1598.84 → 1599.90] is questions and answers.
[1600.42 → 1601.24] One of the questions is
[1601.24 → 1602.28] why do Christians
[1602.28 → 1602.98] need to pray?
[1603.36 → 1604.36] Such an important question
[1604.36 → 1604.92] that we should ask
[1604.92 → 1605.70] in every generation
[1605.70 → 1606.88] and here's the answer
[1606.88 → 1608.18] with like a ton of footnotes
[1608.18 → 1609.10] on scripture passages.
[1609.82 → 1610.48] The answer is
[1610.48 → 1611.84] prayer is the most
[1611.84 → 1612.84] important part
[1612.84 → 1614.76] of the thankfulness
[1614.76 → 1616.48] God requires of us.
[1617.52 → 1618.24] And also
[1618.24 → 1619.70] prayer is
[1619.70 → 1620.76] sorry I'll say that again
[1620.76 → 1621.44] and also because
[1621.44 → 1622.64] God gives His grace
[1622.64 → 1623.70] and Holy Spirit
[1623.70 → 1625.02] only
[1625.02 → 1626.74] to those who pray
[1626.74 → 1627.42] continually
[1627.42 → 1628.96] and groan inwardly
[1628.96 → 1630.30] asking God
[1630.30 → 1631.08] for these gifts
[1631.08 → 1632.76] and thanking Him
[1632.76 → 1633.96] for them.
[1637.06 → 1637.88] The door
[1637.88 → 1638.62] to the power
[1638.62 → 1639.32] of the Spirit
[1639.32 → 1640.80] is available
[1640.80 → 1641.88] to all of us
[1641.88 → 1642.98] through prayer.
[1644.04 → 1644.58] I want to
[1644.58 → 1645.34] just share a story
[1645.34 → 1646.00] about my own life.
[1646.14 → 1646.96] Before I was ordained
[1646.96 → 1647.54] as a pastor
[1647.54 → 1648.58] I jumped through
[1648.58 → 1649.52] all the same ordination
[1649.52 → 1650.68] hoops as Jonathan
[1650.68 → 1651.22] jumped through
[1651.22 → 1652.40] and before I was
[1652.40 → 1653.20] publicly examined
[1653.20 → 1653.58] I had to meet
[1653.58 → 1654.34] with three pastors
[1654.34 → 1655.52] pastors to sort of
[1655.52 → 1656.32] make sure I was
[1656.32 → 1657.44] eligible to be examined
[1657.44 → 1658.34] for being a pastor
[1658.34 → 1659.38] and we had this
[1659.38 → 1659.84] conversation
[1659.84 → 1660.38] two of them were
[1660.38 → 1660.92] asking a lot of
[1660.92 → 1661.30] the questions
[1661.30 → 1662.18] and in that room
[1662.18 → 1663.32] was a retired pastor
[1663.32 → 1664.04] he had just finished
[1664.04 → 1664.90] ministry a few years
[1664.90 → 1666.00] before this conversation.
[1666.68 → 1667.50] Didn't say much
[1667.50 → 1667.90] throughout the whole
[1667.90 → 1668.38] conversation
[1668.38 → 1669.30] and then at the end
[1669.30 → 1669.74] he was sitting
[1669.74 → 1670.32] right beside me
[1670.32 → 1671.32] he leaned right
[1671.32 → 1672.12] into my face
[1672.12 → 1672.80] and he asked me
[1672.80 → 1673.34] two questions
[1673.34 → 1673.84] that I will never
[1673.84 → 1674.14] forget.
[1674.26 → 1674.98] The first is this
[1674.98 → 1676.16] how are you going
[1676.16 → 1676.82] to protect your
[1676.82 → 1678.48] marriage in ministry
[1678.48 → 1679.72] and not sacrifice
[1679.72 → 1680.56] your family
[1680.56 → 1681.84] on the altar of ministry?
[1682.26 → 1683.10] Such a good question.
[1683.10 → 1684.10] The second question
[1684.10 → 1684.88] I mean picture him
[1684.88 → 1686.32] eyes wide open
[1686.32 → 1687.18] face to face
[1687.18 → 1687.98] he's like breathing
[1687.98 → 1688.42] on me
[1688.42 → 1688.86] he said
[1688.86 → 1689.94] are you praying
[1689.94 → 1690.66] every day
[1690.66 → 1692.08] for the infilling
[1692.08 → 1693.30] power of the Holy Spirit?
[1694.06 → 1694.90] I'm sitting to look
[1694.90 → 1695.10] at him
[1695.10 → 1695.36] I'm like
[1695.36 → 1696.22] nope
[1696.22 → 1697.76] but I want to now
[1697.76 → 1699.92] and from that point
[1699.92 → 1700.66] I've tried to make
[1700.66 → 1701.60] a practice of daily
[1701.60 → 1702.62] praying for the power
[1702.62 → 1703.10] of the Spirit
[1703.10 → 1703.68] because I look at
[1703.68 → 1704.56] this retired pastor
[1704.56 → 1705.04] and I say
[1705.04 → 1706.02] I want to finish
[1706.02 → 1706.52] like him
[1706.52 → 1707.70] I want to finish
[1707.70 → 1708.04] well
[1708.04 → 1708.86] not be tripped up
[1708.86 → 1709.32] by the old
[1709.32 → 1709.96] simple nature
[1709.96 → 1710.66] that's going to come
[1710.66 → 1711.46] in all sorts of ways
[1711.46 → 1712.32] for me as a pastor
[1712.32 → 1713.44] as it does for you
[1713.44 → 1714.12] in your life
[1714.12 → 1715.18] and so I pray
[1715.18 → 1716.34] seeking to do this
[1716.34 → 1716.90] every day
[1716.90 → 1718.40] asking for the Spirit
[1718.40 → 1719.32] of the living God
[1719.32 → 1720.42] to fill me
[1720.42 → 1721.30] and transform me
[1721.30 → 1721.76] so that I can
[1721.76 → 1722.66] serve him faithfully
[1722.66 → 1724.36] and the power
[1724.36 → 1724.94] of the Spirit
[1724.94 → 1726.32] is available
[1726.32 → 1728.86] for all of us
[1728.86 → 1731.54] and so what I want
[1731.54 → 1732.08] to do now
[1732.08 → 1732.76] is prayed
[1732.76 → 1734.52] and I've written
[1734.52 → 1735.50] just a couple of points
[1735.50 → 1736.18] of things I want
[1736.18 → 1736.76] to pray for
[1736.76 → 1738.02] and I'm going
[1738.02 → 1738.28] to leave
[1738.28 → 1739.36] an extended time
[1739.36 → 1739.86] for us
[1739.86 → 1740.66] to bring before
[1740.66 → 1741.08] the Lord
[1741.08 → 1742.24] whatever might be
[1742.24 → 1742.66] going through
[1742.66 → 1743.18] our hearts
[1743.18 → 1744.72] perhaps it's conviction
[1744.72 → 1746.78] about not feeling
[1746.78 → 1748.00] safe with the Spirit
[1748.00 → 1749.02] perhaps it's guilt
[1749.02 → 1749.84] around whatever
[1749.84 → 1750.78] we don't pray on
[1750.78 → 1751.76] perhaps it's just
[1751.76 → 1752.50] a hunger
[1752.50 → 1753.16] you're feeling
[1753.16 → 1754.84] pray into those things
[1754.84 → 1755.32] and then we're going
[1755.32 → 1756.08] to worship together
[1756.08 → 1757.24] before we break bread
[1757.24 → 1759.08] so would you join me
[1759.08 → 1760.16] and allow me to lead us
[1760.16 → 1761.10] in a time of extended
[1761.10 → 1761.46] prayer
[1761.46 → 1771.40] God we're not even sure
[1771.40 → 1774.02] what it would look like
[1774.02 → 1775.28] for your Spirit
[1775.28 → 1776.74] to breathe life
[1776.74 → 1777.56] in our church
[1777.56 → 1780.06] we're cautious
[1780.06 → 1782.30] we're fearful
[1782.30 → 1785.20] and we really want
[1785.20 → 1786.26] to stay in control
[1786.26 → 1789.30] and so I pray
[1789.30 → 1790.50] come Holy Spirit
[1790.50 → 1792.88] pour out your love
[1792.88 → 1793.72] upon us
[1793.72 → 1795.64] so that we
[1795.64 → 1796.82] can be free
[1796.82 → 1799.70] free to be the body
[1799.70 → 1800.30] of Christ
[1800.30 → 1803.18] free to love
[1803.18 → 1803.90] others
[1803.90 → 1805.10] as you love them
[1805.10 → 1807.74] free to serve
[1807.74 → 1808.86] in humility
[1808.86 → 1812.26] Father we're tired
[1812.26 → 1814.04] of living life
[1814.04 → 1815.22] in our own strength
[1815.22 → 1817.86] we're exhausted
[1817.86 → 1819.50] by the temptations
[1819.50 → 1820.94] that trip us up
[1820.94 → 1822.08] every single day
[1822.08 → 1824.40] we're tired
[1824.40 → 1825.92] by trying
[1825.92 → 1826.90] to be in control
[1826.90 → 1827.94] of our lives
[1827.94 → 1829.80] and Father
[1829.80 → 1830.62] I ask that you
[1830.62 → 1831.10] would give us
[1831.10 → 1832.84] a deep hunger
[1832.84 → 1833.82] for change
[1833.82 → 1835.76] we ask that your
[1835.76 → 1836.82] Spirit would give us
[1836.82 → 1838.34] a profound desire
[1838.34 → 1839.74] to let you
[1839.74 → 1841.06] lead the way
[1841.06 → 1843.06] and so I pray
[1843.06 → 1843.48] again
[1843.48 → 1844.84] come Holy Spirit
[1844.84 → 1846.52] have your way
[1846.52 → 1847.62] in our church
[1847.62 → 1849.48] have your way
[1849.48 → 1850.28] in our marriages
[1850.28 → 1851.64] and our families
[1851.64 → 1853.00] our shared
[1853.00 → 1854.64] and private lives
[1854.64 → 1856.82] hear our prayers
[1856.82 → 1858.06] as we lift them up
[1858.06 → 1858.62] to you now
[1858.62 → 1868.16] to look arrested
[1868.16 → 1869.04] a favour
[1869.04 → 1869.46] for a psychiatric
[1869.46 → 1869.86] sense
[1869.86 → 1870.60] as we bring this
[1870.60 → 1872.00] together
[1872.00 → 1872.84] to keep us
[1872.84 → 1874.84] inbuilt
