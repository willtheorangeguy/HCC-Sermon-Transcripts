[0.00 → 7.70] Good morning, Hope.
[9.44 → 13.22] It is my privilege to bring you God's word this morning on this beautiful,
[13.82 → 16.96] I think it's becoming more beautiful of a long weekend,
[17.38 → 19.62] where we get to celebrate Canada Day tomorrow.
[20.14 → 24.86] And I love the prayer that we get to call this great country our home as well.
[26.66 → 28.46] Somebody from the 9 a.m. reminded me,
[28.46 → 34.42] if you're going to let us know what happened in certain events,
[34.78 → 37.90] I have to give a spoiler alert because they were going to watch it later on.
[38.22 → 42.46] And what I'm talking about is our Canadian men's team did something,
[42.56 → 45.78] so you can go find out later, and they did well.
[46.26 → 50.42] And somebody also reminded me that our Canadian women's team have been doing a great job,
[50.86 → 56.16] and so our men are finally sort of catching up to the success our women have had in soccer, finally.
[56.16 → 59.68] And so we get to celebrate that tomorrow on Canada Day as well.
[60.36 → 65.56] Well, for today, we get to come to the end of our series on the Holy Spirit.
[66.52 → 72.30] And even though I know that everyone remembers to the detail all the important,
[72.78 → 76.72] significant parts of each sermon in this series in the past,
[76.72 → 81.66] I thought it would be beneficial for us if we could do some sort of overview of the highlights,
[81.76 → 87.84] you could say, of some of the important details from the past sermons.
[88.96 → 92.80] At the beginning of our sermon series, if you can recall,
[92.94 → 95.50] we started in the book of Acts, in Acts 2,
[95.86 → 99.38] where Pastor Dave preached on how the future fullness of God's kingdom
[99.38 → 103.54] breaks into our world here and now through His Holy Spirit.
[103.54 → 108.46] And if you took Serge with me in this past season,
[108.76 → 110.90] this should be relatively fresh in your mind.
[111.22 → 113.84] If you can recall the story of the Bible with the arrows,
[114.30 → 117.92] it's that final arrow of full restoration of God's kingdom.
[118.62 → 123.92] It's in breaking into now, not just as we wait until the end,
[124.20 → 126.52] but here and now through God's Holy Spirit.
[126.86 → 131.04] And as He leads us, it breaks into the here and now.
[131.04 → 136.18] And the significant question that both Pastor Dave and Pastor Sid asked in their sermons were,
[136.92 → 140.66] do we have, and I love this phrase, holy expectation?
[141.16 → 144.22] And I wrote it in big letters in my notes too, in my sermon notes.
[144.66 → 145.84] Holy expectation.
[146.68 → 150.88] In other words, do we really expect and do we welcome
[150.88 → 155.22] and are we asking the Holy Spirit to guide our lives?
[155.22 → 161.60] And then we moved on to reflect on being gifted for God and for one another.
[162.26 → 167.94] We try to spark our imaginations of how the Spirit-led ministry and life of Jesus Christ Himself
[167.94 → 171.78] is made possible even in our lives as He guides us.
[172.18 → 177.20] And as we try to faithfully and publicly witness to this life in the Spirit
[177.20 → 181.36] through our words, deeds, and shared lives with our neighbours.
[182.16 → 184.50] That's how we are a light for the world.
[184.50 → 188.42] And then we asked, just last week, Pastor Dave asked,
[188.96 → 194.74] what does it look like to acknowledge and also to use all the diverse gifts
[194.74 → 196.96] that God has granted us through His Holy Spirit?
[197.22 → 199.20] Not one more important than the other.
[199.60 → 201.94] We are all gifted in some way.
[202.30 → 207.14] And we are all asked and called to use that gift for one another
[207.14 → 209.20] and to be a blessing for the world.
[209.20 → 212.44] And so with this overview of the series in mind,
[212.66 → 217.12] we reflect today from the letter to the Galatians on this life led by the Spirit
[217.12 → 221.34] and how Paul puts it and also how the Apostle Peter puts it in his letter.
[221.88 → 226.04] It is to reflect God's goodness and God's holiness.
[227.22 → 228.94] We are called to be holy as well.
[229.30 → 233.40] And before we get to Galatians, this is what the Apostle Peter says in his letter.
[233.40 → 235.24] He says in 1 Peter 1,
[235.86 → 241.54] As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.
[242.44 → 246.44] But just as He who called you is holy, that's our God.
[248.10 → 250.98] Be holy in all you do, for it is written,
[251.72 → 253.66] Be holy because I am holy.
[254.00 → 255.10] And that's from Leviticus.
[255.10 → 260.04] And I think it's appropriate that we land here at the end of our series on the Holy Spirit
[260.04 → 263.20] as a fresh reminder of our belonging in Christ,
[263.48 → 266.00] which is the life in the Holy Spirit
[266.00 → 270.10] and how this is a calling to live a life,
[270.24 → 273.88] to live out the life of Christ-like holiness.
[274.80 → 275.92] Christ-like holiness.
[276.48 → 277.92] And so if you have your Bibles with you,
[278.00 → 279.86] if you can turn with me to Galatians 5
[279.86 → 282.48] where it will be available for you on the screen.
[282.48 → 287.44] We read from Galatians 5 verse 16
[287.44 → 290.70] where Paul writes,
[291.38 → 293.10] So I say, walk by the Spirit
[293.10 → 296.38] and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
[297.12 → 298.96] For the flesh, or sinful nature,
[299.38 → 302.22] the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit
[302.22 → 304.52] and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh.
[305.10 → 306.86] They are in conflict with each other
[306.86 → 308.74] so that you are not to do whatever you want.
[309.62 → 311.12] But if you are led by the Spirit,
[311.12 → 312.90] you are not under the law.
[313.92 → 315.62] The acts of the flesh are obvious.
[316.20 → 318.52] Sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery,
[318.94 → 320.34] idolatry and witchcraft,
[320.76 → 323.22] hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,
[323.62 → 326.70] selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy,
[327.24 → 329.00] drunkenness, orgies and the like.
[329.08 → 331.16] I warn you, as I did before,
[331.38 → 335.00] that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[335.00 → 340.22] But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
[340.36 → 343.18] forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
[343.58 → 345.78] gentleness and self-control.
[346.82 → 348.88] Against such things there is no law.
[349.42 → 351.02] Those who belong to Christ Jesus
[351.02 → 354.46] have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
[355.46 → 357.46] Since we live by the Spirit then,
[357.82 → 359.80] let us keep in step with the Spirit.
[360.22 → 361.80] Let us not become conceited,
[361.80 → 363.84] provoking and envying each other.
[364.52 → 365.72] This is the word of the Lord.
[368.98 → 372.46] And as I was doing research for this sermon this past week,
[372.92 → 375.46] this proverb or this saying caught my attention.
[375.78 → 377.12] And this is not a biblical proverb,
[377.34 → 379.12] but I don't know if you've heard this before.
[380.00 → 382.60] Sow a thought, and you reap an action.
[383.46 → 385.66] Sow an action, and you reap a habit.
[386.72 → 389.52] Sow a habit, and you reap a character.
[389.52 → 390.52] Sow a habit, and you reap a habit.
[390.52 → 391.42] So the saying goes.
[392.38 → 394.94] Well, around the end of summer last year,
[395.12 → 396.92] so we're talking about a year back,
[397.30 → 400.96] and we were as a staff preparing for the kickoff barbecue,
[401.14 → 402.98] which happens in early September.
[403.68 → 406.32] And one of my responsibilities that I had in mind
[406.32 → 407.52] was to buy cones.
[408.48 → 410.70] You know, like those traffic cones, the orange colour?
[410.70 → 415.66] And so what it was meant to be was I would buy the cones
[415.66 → 418.92] and we would set it up and put it in front of some of the parking spaces
[418.92 → 422.38] in front of the green grass area there
[422.38 → 425.04] so that we would have more room for maybe activities
[425.04 → 428.24] or if we needed more room for more tables and chairs.
[428.48 → 433.32] That was the purpose of me trying to go and find and buying cones.
[433.94 → 435.38] Now, when I looked into it,
[435.50 → 437.74] it was actually more expensive than I thought,
[437.74 → 439.76] and it was a little bit harder to find.
[441.02 → 444.44] Anyway, for a good two weeks, I want to say,
[444.70 → 446.56] all I could think about were cones.
[447.12 → 448.52] That's all that was in my head.
[448.90 → 450.90] I would notice, you know, all the traffic cones,
[451.14 → 453.06] and there are a endless number of traffic cones
[453.06 → 454.62] all over in construction sites,
[454.74 → 455.80] and part of me was thinking,
[455.90 → 457.48] can I just kind of like borrow a few of those
[457.48 → 458.36] and then bring it back?
[459.42 → 460.84] Wherever I drove, I would think of it.
[460.96 → 463.40] And even like, you know, it was summer,
[464.00 → 464.72] lots of ice cream.
[464.72 → 466.60] And whenever I saw ice cream cones even,
[466.74 → 469.48] I would think, cone, oh, I still have to get cones.
[470.60 → 472.90] And then I get on my phone or on my computer,
[473.00 → 474.66] and one of the first things I would do is,
[475.26 → 476.52] yes, look up cones.
[476.78 → 479.08] Online, shopping, all my algorithm
[479.08 → 480.72] were throwing me a bunch of cones.
[481.28 → 482.78] Great deals you can have.
[482.78 → 486.86] And then that even led me to regularly making stops
[486.86 → 487.96] by the tool section,
[488.06 → 489.28] which is usually where the cones are.
[489.80 → 491.18] You know, I would go to Canadian Tire,
[491.36 → 493.82] Rona, Home Depot, Costco, Superstore,
[493.92 → 495.16] even Walmart, you name it,
[495.26 → 497.04] and I would always look over my shoulder and go,
[497.12 → 497.64] oh, is that a cone?
[498.40 → 499.10] Oh, is that a cone?
[500.04 → 501.72] And that's the habit that I got into.
[501.84 → 504.16] That even continued after I bought the cones, by the way.
[504.22 → 505.24] That was a little bit annoying.
[505.34 → 506.06] I already had the cones.
[506.14 → 508.24] I'm going, oh, oh, right, I already have it.
[508.24 → 512.78] But so safe to say, my life became fixated on cones.
[512.84 → 513.58] I know that's silly.
[514.64 → 518.56] But that occurred to me now, as it did even back then,
[518.66 → 520.04] that this is sort of an illustration
[520.04 → 523.04] of what our spiritual lives should be like.
[524.14 → 526.88] In other words, a life of holiness,
[527.48 → 529.58] a life that walks by the Spirit,
[529.58 → 533.32] is to constantly be thinking, to be acting,
[533.96 → 537.86] and to always have this living in Christ,
[538.24 → 541.30] fixated on my God, always thinking about Him,
[541.56 → 544.88] always acting, and having habits that form out of that.
[546.26 → 549.60] And hope the good news for us from our passage this morning,
[549.84 → 551.94] from Galatians, actually, in the whole,
[552.26 → 554.20] is that we are freed in Christ
[554.20 → 556.82] to live this life of holiness out.
[558.10 → 560.90] God's Holy Spirit Himself dwells in us
[560.90 → 563.26] and guides us to a life of holiness,
[563.64 → 565.86] a life of Christ-likeness,
[565.86 → 568.18] in and through our thoughts,
[568.30 → 569.58] our actions, our habits,
[570.06 → 571.10] forming character.
[572.14 → 573.32] And in the words of Paul,
[573.40 → 575.32] what Paul calls this character part
[575.32 → 577.54] is the fruit of the Spirit.
[578.24 → 580.10] And notice that it's not fruits of the Spirit,
[580.24 → 581.76] it is the fruit of the Spirit.
[582.30 → 582.92] And he's saying,
[583.16 → 584.66] this comes from God Himself.
[585.36 → 586.96] And to emphasize the main point here
[586.96 → 588.14] before we move on,
[588.40 → 591.08] I do not want to somehow misrepresent the gospel,
[591.08 → 594.10] that this is some sort of self-help method
[594.10 → 595.24] for a better life.
[596.04 → 597.28] The fruit of the Spirit,
[597.72 → 599.28] a life of Christ-like holiness,
[599.52 → 600.52] is made possible,
[600.80 → 602.90] not by our own self-reliance
[602.90 → 604.34] or our own self-efforts.
[604.66 → 606.64] This is not some sort of flashy program
[606.64 → 608.56] or some sort of technique
[608.56 → 610.08] that gives you a better life.
[610.68 → 612.24] But this life of holiness,
[612.68 → 614.56] this life of Christ-likeness,
[614.86 → 617.58] is by the empowering of the Holy Spirit Himself.
[617.58 → 620.86] The promise of the gospel
[620.86 → 623.34] is that this Spirit-led life
[623.34 → 627.22] is gifted to those who belong to Christ.
[628.16 → 629.12] That is for us.
[629.36 → 633.24] That is a gift only by the grace of God.
[634.80 → 635.84] And many times,
[635.92 → 637.60] we need to name the fact
[637.60 → 638.56] that many times,
[638.66 → 640.14] this life led by the Spirit,
[640.92 → 641.92] it hurts.
[642.62 → 643.94] It's uncomfortable.
[644.68 → 646.14] It's not all easygoing.
[646.14 → 648.10] Because part of it means
[648.10 → 650.16] to acknowledge and resist
[650.16 → 651.56] our old selves,
[652.10 → 653.94] our old sinful natures,
[654.36 → 654.92] the flesh,
[655.36 → 656.64] as Paul says it in his letter.
[657.98 → 658.34] And so,
[658.50 → 660.36] one of the main books that I read
[660.36 → 663.14] was from the late theologian J.I. Packer.
[663.42 → 664.50] And he said it like this.
[665.22 → 665.60] He said,
[665.88 → 666.80] God's acceptance
[666.80 → 668.72] of each Christian believer
[668.72 → 670.46] is perfect to start.
[671.28 → 672.20] It is then accompanied
[672.20 → 673.44] by repentance
[673.44 → 675.02] all throughout our lives.
[675.02 → 676.42] I think that captures
[676.42 → 678.10] the picture of what
[678.10 → 679.82] a Spirit-led life looks like.
[680.78 → 681.10] And hence,
[681.20 → 682.14] Paul says too,
[682.66 → 683.64] walk by the Spirit
[683.64 → 685.20] and you will not gratify
[685.20 → 687.42] the desires of your sinful nature,
[687.54 → 688.06] your flesh.
[689.66 → 690.04] And so,
[690.16 → 690.76] to sum up,
[691.48 → 692.60] this life of holiness,
[693.18 → 694.68] this life of Christ-like holiness,
[695.30 → 696.54] is twofold in character.
[697.12 → 697.46] One,
[697.84 → 698.88] it is the forming
[698.88 → 700.24] of Christ-like thoughts
[700.24 → 700.92] and actions
[700.92 → 701.58] and habits
[701.58 → 702.90] that allow us
[702.90 → 704.58] to reflect God's own goodness
[704.58 → 705.86] and love for the world.
[706.14 → 707.22] It is the same old
[707.22 → 709.96] to be blessed,
[710.52 → 711.44] to be a blessing
[711.44 → 712.90] for the world.
[713.76 → 715.00] And in Paul's words,
[715.16 → 715.66] he says,
[715.74 → 716.28] and he calls it
[716.28 → 717.42] the fruit of the Spirit,
[717.90 → 718.58] to be blessed,
[718.70 → 719.32] to be a blessing.
[720.40 → 721.96] On the other side of this
[721.96 → 723.46] is the conviction
[723.46 → 724.46] and resistance
[724.46 → 725.96] against sin
[725.96 → 727.30] and all the brokenness
[727.30 → 728.26] that comes from it.
[729.36 → 730.54] And this latter part,
[730.72 → 731.28] so you have,
[731.42 → 732.06] on the one hand,
[732.44 → 733.88] forming of Christ-like holiness
[733.88 → 734.88] in our lives.
[735.14 → 736.22] And on the other hand,
[736.56 → 737.14] this conviction
[737.14 → 737.84] and resistance
[737.84 → 738.52] against sin.
[738.58 → 739.14] And this is what
[739.14 → 740.16] Paul explains first.
[740.50 → 741.10] He says that
[741.10 → 742.36] these acts of the flesh
[742.36 → 743.66] is contrary
[743.66 → 745.26] to the acts
[745.26 → 746.16] or the fruit
[746.16 → 746.78] of the Spirit.
[748.42 → 749.72] The life in the Spirit
[749.72 → 751.06] cannot and does not
[751.06 → 752.08] go hand in hand
[752.08 → 753.14] with our sinful,
[753.32 → 754.38] ungodly lives.
[754.38 → 756.08] And as Pastor Sid mentioned
[756.08 → 756.70] in his sermon
[756.70 → 758.48] a few weeks ago,
[758.74 → 759.38] he said that
[759.38 → 760.38] relying on the Spirit
[760.38 → 761.80] is not some sort of
[761.80 → 762.66] easy way out
[762.66 → 763.98] to solve all of our problems.
[764.20 → 764.66] And this part
[764.66 → 765.86] is almost a direct quote.
[766.44 → 766.90] Sid said,
[767.20 → 767.50] rather,
[767.82 → 768.92] the life in the Spirit
[768.92 → 769.78] leads us
[769.78 → 771.22] to be fully responsible.
[772.30 → 773.78] To be fully responsible
[773.78 → 774.88] and convicts us,
[774.96 → 775.24] actually,
[775.32 → 775.90] of our sins
[775.90 → 777.86] to strive for repentance
[777.86 → 779.22] and shalom.
[780.40 → 781.38] The reconciliation
[781.38 → 782.42] of brokenness.
[783.40 → 784.36] And Jesus even said
[784.36 → 785.44] in his Beatitudes,
[785.72 → 786.58] in the Beatitudes,
[786.90 → 788.12] he blesses those
[788.12 → 789.46] who mourn.
[790.46 → 792.02] Why would Jesus say
[792.02 → 792.72] that we are blessed
[792.72 → 793.46] if we mourn?
[793.56 → 794.58] Why would we mourn?
[795.20 → 795.72] He says,
[795.98 → 796.70] blessed are those
[796.70 → 797.22] who mourn
[797.22 → 798.58] for they shall be comforted.
[798.72 → 800.32] Because we who live
[800.32 → 801.46] by the Spirit
[801.46 → 802.72] mourn
[802.72 → 803.68] and wrestle
[803.68 → 805.16] against the brokenness
[805.16 → 806.38] and the effects of sin
[806.38 → 808.50] within our own lives,
[808.90 → 809.92] within the relationships
[809.92 → 810.78] with one another,
[811.12 → 812.12] within the relationship
[812.12 → 813.56] with God himself
[813.56 → 814.94] and with all creation.
[815.34 → 816.44] We mourn at the fact
[816.44 → 817.54] that the world
[817.54 → 818.60] is not the way
[818.60 → 819.58] it's supposed to be.
[820.48 → 821.68] And we are comforted
[821.68 → 822.58] because we have hope
[822.58 → 823.08] in God
[823.08 → 823.88] who will bring
[823.88 → 825.38] full restoration.
[825.66 → 826.84] And he makes it possible
[826.84 → 828.20] little bit by little bit
[828.20 → 828.86] in our lives
[828.86 → 830.22] through his Holy Spirit's
[830.22 → 830.60] leading.
[832.28 → 833.36] Our lives
[833.36 → 834.12] in the Spirit
[834.12 → 835.88] does not allow
[835.88 → 836.32] for us
[836.32 → 837.56] to simply ignore
[837.56 → 838.46] and do whatever
[838.46 → 838.96] we want
[838.96 → 839.64] because we are
[839.64 → 840.10] quote unquote
[840.10 → 840.58] free.
[841.16 → 842.06] And that's the message
[842.06 → 843.40] to Galatian believers here.
[843.94 → 844.64] That is what Paul
[844.64 → 845.46] is trying to say
[845.46 → 846.10] when he says
[846.10 → 846.84] in verse 18,
[847.28 → 848.06] if you are led
[848.06 → 848.98] by the Spirit,
[849.72 → 850.40] you are not
[850.40 → 851.24] under the law,
[851.44 → 851.88] he says.
[852.62 → 853.56] And you might wonder,
[854.08 → 855.38] why does the law
[855.38 → 855.96] come up here
[855.96 → 856.56] all of a sudden?
[856.82 → 857.56] Why does Paul
[857.56 → 858.36] mention the law?
[859.70 → 860.44] And if you can maybe
[860.44 → 861.30] remember even a little
[861.30 → 861.96] further back,
[862.02 → 862.40] at the beginning
[862.40 → 862.82] of the year,
[862.90 → 863.62] we started with
[863.62 → 864.54] a series on
[864.54 → 865.42] the book of Galatians.
[866.04 → 867.06] And part of that
[867.06 → 868.44] was the original context,
[868.44 → 869.36] the original audience
[869.36 → 869.96] I should say,
[870.28 → 871.16] is that there were
[871.16 → 872.46] believers who thought
[872.46 → 873.00] they could do
[873.00 → 873.78] whatever they wanted
[873.78 → 874.84] because they were
[874.84 → 875.96] free in Christ.
[876.76 → 877.58] And then on the
[877.58 → 878.36] other side of it,
[878.46 → 879.80] you had other
[879.80 → 880.50] quote unquote
[880.50 → 881.04] Christians,
[881.50 → 882.22] Judaizes,
[882.60 → 883.26] agitators,
[883.78 → 885.18] that twisted the
[885.18 → 885.88] gospel and said
[885.88 → 886.66] that living out
[886.66 → 887.62] their faith in Jesus
[887.62 → 889.64] meant to follow
[889.64 → 890.70] specific Jewish
[890.70 → 891.58] ethnic laws.
[892.16 → 892.56] And so they
[892.56 → 893.44] equated the gospel
[893.44 → 894.74] with Jesus plus
[894.74 → 895.70] something else.
[896.84 → 897.82] And what Paul
[897.82 → 898.94] is saying in response
[898.94 → 899.82] to these believers
[899.82 → 900.80] in Galatia
[900.80 → 902.50] is that true life,
[903.24 → 904.44] truly living out
[904.44 → 905.34] our faith as
[905.34 → 905.82] Christians,
[906.18 → 907.50] and true freedom,
[907.96 → 908.82] what that is,
[908.88 → 910.52] is it's spirit-led.
[911.22 → 912.16] It is a life
[912.16 → 912.92] that is led
[912.92 → 913.80] by the Spirit.
[914.10 → 915.20] The Holy Spirit
[915.20 → 916.38] and Holy Spirit
[916.38 → 917.56] alone frees us
[917.56 → 918.68] and helps shape
[918.68 → 919.44] and form us
[919.44 → 920.76] to stand against
[920.76 → 921.40] sin.
[922.02 → 922.96] So that's one aspect.
[923.28 → 924.60] And also produces
[924.60 → 925.18] fruit,
[925.18 → 926.66] Christ-like holiness
[926.66 → 927.62] that reflects
[927.62 → 928.86] God's own loving
[928.86 → 929.68] goodness for the
[929.68 → 929.98] world.
[930.50 → 931.48] And against this
[931.48 → 931.96] fruit,
[932.60 → 933.14] God's loving
[933.14 → 933.60] goodness,
[933.90 → 934.58] against that
[934.58 → 935.00] fruit,
[935.50 → 936.42] there is no law.
[936.84 → 937.56] That's what Paul
[937.56 → 938.00] is saying.
[938.80 → 939.60] And along these
[939.60 → 940.36] same lines,
[940.52 → 940.96] the famous
[940.96 → 941.82] reformer Martin
[941.82 → 942.18] Luther,
[942.58 → 943.60] he said it in a
[943.60 → 944.12] similar way.
[944.20 → 944.90] I'm paraphrasing
[944.90 → 945.18] here.
[945.42 → 946.72] He said that if
[946.72 → 947.82] everybody in the
[947.82 → 948.30] world that we
[948.30 → 948.96] live in right now,
[949.02 → 949.98] if everybody in
[949.98 → 950.62] the world were
[950.62 → 951.90] real, true
[951.90 → 952.46] Christians,
[952.46 → 952.58] Christians,
[953.18 → 953.80] we wouldn't
[953.80 → 954.74] need any laws.
[955.78 → 956.64] If everybody
[956.64 → 957.34] was truly,
[957.80 → 958.34] every single
[958.34 → 958.92] person in the
[958.92 → 959.76] world was truly
[959.76 → 960.44] led by the
[960.44 → 960.72] Spirit,
[961.10 → 961.72] and they walked
[961.72 → 962.22] in step with
[962.22 → 962.58] the Spirit,
[962.74 → 963.16] you wouldn't
[963.16 → 964.02] need any laws
[964.02 → 964.74] to regulate
[964.74 → 965.72] our societies.
[970.86 → 971.38] So,
[971.78 → 972.68] you ask the
[972.68 → 973.02] question,
[974.02 → 974.94] why do we
[974.94 → 975.80] have laws in
[975.80 → 976.42] the first place
[976.42 → 976.68] then?
[977.54 → 977.94] So,
[978.06 → 978.82] if everyone
[978.82 → 979.62] has the Holy
[979.62 → 980.24] Spirit guiding
[980.24 → 980.60] them,
[980.60 → 982.72] if everyone
[982.72 → 983.38] were to have
[983.38 → 983.72] the Spirit
[983.72 → 984.54] guiding them,
[984.64 → 984.94] then we
[984.94 → 985.40] wouldn't need
[985.40 → 985.66] laws,
[985.74 → 986.32] but we do
[986.32 → 987.44] have the
[987.44 → 987.70] law.
[988.20 → 988.62] And God
[988.62 → 989.76] gifted us
[989.76 → 990.32] with the
[990.32 → 990.62] law.
[991.20 → 991.44] And you
[991.44 → 991.76] ask the
[991.76 → 992.34] question then,
[992.50 → 993.04] why do we
[993.04 → 993.48] have it?
[994.72 → 995.02] Well,
[995.08 → 995.88] in the
[995.88 → 997.02] earlier parts
[997.02 → 997.72] of Galatians,
[998.16 → 998.78] Paul says
[998.78 → 999.70] that the
[999.70 → 1000.06] law was
[1000.06 → 1000.54] given to
[1000.54 → 1001.26] us to
[1001.26 → 1002.08] teach us
[1002.08 → 1002.60] and guide
[1002.60 → 1002.98] us to
[1002.98 → 1003.32] the grace
[1003.32 → 1003.82] of God.
[1004.54 → 1005.02] Without
[1005.02 → 1005.58] the law,
[1005.68 → 1006.34] without God
[1006.34 → 1007.04] giving us
[1007.04 → 1008.46] specific standards
[1008.46 → 1009.36] of teaching
[1009.36 → 1010.28] us what sin
[1010.28 → 1010.86] is,
[1011.14 → 1011.60] we wouldn't
[1011.60 → 1012.18] even know
[1012.18 → 1012.62] what sin
[1012.62 → 1012.92] is.
[1013.56 → 1014.02] That's how
[1014.02 → 1014.70] broken we
[1014.70 → 1014.90] are.
[1015.22 → 1015.60] We need
[1015.60 → 1016.20] God's
[1016.20 → 1017.16] guidance to
[1017.16 → 1017.64] even know
[1017.64 → 1018.06] what sin
[1018.06 → 1018.38] is.
[1018.72 → 1019.02] And in
[1019.02 → 1019.42] turn,
[1019.78 → 1020.04] that would
[1020.04 → 1020.64] lead us
[1020.64 → 1021.14] to the
[1021.14 → 1021.68] throne of
[1021.68 → 1022.10] mercy,
[1022.44 → 1022.78] that we
[1022.78 → 1024.10] would realize
[1024.10 → 1024.76] and acknowledge
[1024.76 → 1025.52] we need
[1025.52 → 1026.00] the grace
[1026.00 → 1026.54] of God,
[1026.62 → 1026.90] otherwise
[1026.90 → 1027.58] we are
[1027.58 → 1028.34] hopeless.
[1030.16 → 1030.52] And for
[1030.52 → 1030.90] Paul,
[1031.08 → 1031.64] specifically,
[1031.90 → 1032.32] in the
[1032.32 → 1032.80] passage that
[1032.80 → 1033.20] we read,
[1033.62 → 1034.08] he says
[1034.08 → 1034.68] that these
[1034.68 → 1035.84] sins are
[1035.84 → 1036.36] obvious,
[1037.48 → 1038.10] the acts
[1038.10 → 1038.72] of the
[1038.72 → 1039.08] flesh,
[1039.08 → 1039.88] and he
[1039.88 → 1040.46] lists them,
[1041.04 → 1041.38] sexual
[1041.38 → 1042.08] immorality,
[1042.36 → 1042.82] impurity
[1042.82 → 1043.66] and debauchery,
[1044.20 → 1044.96] idolatry and
[1044.96 → 1045.52] witchcraft,
[1045.68 → 1046.34] which goes
[1046.34 → 1047.10] against and
[1047.10 → 1047.50] breaks our
[1047.50 → 1048.24] relationship with
[1048.24 → 1048.60] God,
[1049.40 → 1049.76] hatred,
[1050.02 → 1050.42] discord,
[1050.64 → 1051.02] jealousy,
[1051.22 → 1051.60] fits of
[1051.60 → 1051.98] rage,
[1052.36 → 1052.64] selfish
[1052.64 → 1053.10] ambition,
[1053.28 → 1053.74] dissensions,
[1053.92 → 1054.46] factions and
[1054.46 → 1054.78] envy,
[1055.26 → 1056.00] drunkenness,
[1056.10 → 1056.60] orgies and
[1056.60 → 1057.02] the like.
[1057.26 → 1058.04] I warn you
[1058.04 → 1058.46] as I did
[1058.46 → 1058.84] before,
[1059.24 → 1059.70] that those
[1059.70 → 1060.00] who live
[1060.00 → 1060.54] like this
[1060.54 → 1061.36] will not
[1061.36 → 1061.88] inherit the
[1061.88 → 1062.54] kingdom of
[1062.54 → 1062.86] God.
[1063.86 → 1064.20] And in
[1064.20 → 1065.20] contrary to
[1065.20 → 1066.00] this list,
[1066.00 → 1067.26] Paul goes
[1067.26 → 1067.64] on to
[1067.64 → 1069.02] list that
[1069.02 → 1069.42] the fruit
[1069.42 → 1069.70] of the
[1069.70 → 1070.72] spirit that
[1070.72 → 1071.32] is contrary
[1071.32 → 1071.78] to the
[1071.78 → 1072.22] acts of
[1072.22 → 1072.70] the flesh
[1072.70 → 1073.46] are love,
[1074.08 → 1074.40] joy,
[1074.86 → 1075.26] peace,
[1075.58 → 1076.10] forbearance,
[1076.20 → 1076.54] kindness,
[1076.78 → 1077.06] goodness,
[1077.60 → 1078.32] faithfulness,
[1078.74 → 1079.46] gentleness,
[1079.94 → 1081.10] and self-control.
[1083.22 → 1083.62] And you
[1083.62 → 1084.04] know what the
[1084.04 → 1084.78] significant part
[1084.78 → 1085.32] of these two
[1085.32 → 1085.90] lists are?
[1086.82 → 1087.54] Whether it
[1087.54 → 1087.92] be the
[1087.92 → 1088.30] acts of
[1088.30 → 1088.70] the flesh
[1088.70 → 1089.16] or sin,
[1089.54 → 1090.00] or whether
[1090.00 → 1090.42] it is the
[1090.42 → 1090.72] fruit of
[1090.72 → 1091.14] the spirit,
[1091.70 → 1092.56] these lists,
[1092.70 → 1093.24] all of them,
[1094.44 → 1095.08] are acts
[1095.08 → 1096.32] of
[1096.32 → 1097.22] rationality.
[1097.88 → 1098.28] They are
[1098.28 → 1099.18] all relational
[1099.18 → 1100.14] in nature.
[1100.78 → 1101.12] Meaning,
[1101.40 → 1101.88] if someone
[1101.88 → 1102.24] were to
[1102.24 → 1102.80] ask you,
[1103.10 → 1103.34] what does
[1103.34 → 1103.62] it means
[1103.62 → 1103.92] to be
[1103.92 → 1104.30] Christian,
[1104.60 → 1104.88] and what
[1104.88 → 1105.10] are the
[1105.10 → 1105.64] standards of
[1105.64 → 1105.94] good,
[1106.04 → 1106.28] and what
[1106.28 → 1106.48] are the
[1106.48 → 1106.90] standards
[1106.90 → 1108.18] of bad,
[1108.80 → 1109.28] you can
[1109.28 → 1109.86] present them
[1109.86 → 1110.26] with this
[1110.26 → 1110.60] list,
[1110.72 → 1110.92] and you
[1110.92 → 1111.26] can also
[1111.26 → 1111.90] even simplify
[1111.90 → 1112.46] saying,
[1113.06 → 1113.56] the acts
[1113.56 → 1114.08] of sin,
[1114.64 → 1115.08] the acts
[1115.08 → 1115.40] of our
[1115.40 → 1116.06] old selves
[1116.06 → 1116.58] of the
[1116.58 → 1116.92] flesh,
[1117.56 → 1118.04] are acts
[1118.04 → 1118.92] that break
[1118.92 → 1119.62] relationships,
[1120.34 → 1120.84] are acts
[1120.84 → 1121.46] that cause
[1121.46 → 1123.12] division in
[1123.12 → 1123.38] whatever
[1123.38 → 1123.94] relationships
[1123.94 → 1124.60] we have.
[1125.08 → 1125.38] And then,
[1125.52 → 1125.76] on the
[1125.76 → 1126.20] flip side
[1126.20 → 1126.52] of it,
[1126.72 → 1127.28] the acts
[1127.28 → 1128.50] of love,
[1128.74 → 1129.22] the acts
[1129.22 → 1129.68] as the
[1129.68 → 1130.08] fruit of
[1130.08 → 1130.66] the spirit,
[1131.42 → 1132.20] are acts
[1132.20 → 1132.78] that bring
[1132.78 → 1133.60] harmony back
[1133.60 → 1134.00] together,
[1134.42 → 1135.06] that bring
[1135.06 → 1135.76] reconciliation,
[1136.38 → 1136.94] that bring
[1136.94 → 1138.12] peace and
[1138.12 → 1138.82] loving kindness
[1138.82 → 1139.58] to one another.
[1141.88 → 1142.60] And so,
[1142.76 → 1143.48] whether you are
[1143.48 → 1143.92] a Christian
[1143.92 → 1144.46] or not,
[1144.98 → 1145.70] which list
[1145.70 → 1146.72] sounds more
[1146.72 → 1147.62] attractive to you?
[1148.30 → 1149.14] If you had a
[1149.14 → 1149.58] choice,
[1150.16 → 1151.22] which list
[1151.22 → 1152.12] would you choose?
[1153.06 → 1154.18] And hopefully,
[1154.42 → 1154.82] that's an
[1154.82 → 1155.60] obvious question.
[1157.14 → 1157.48] And so,
[1157.58 → 1157.80] what the
[1157.80 → 1158.46] word of God
[1158.46 → 1159.24] presents to
[1159.24 → 1160.22] us is the
[1160.22 → 1161.00] reality that
[1161.00 → 1162.00] life in the
[1162.00 → 1162.94] spirit is
[1162.94 → 1163.60] true life.
[1164.04 → 1164.76] The real
[1164.76 → 1165.90] life that
[1165.90 → 1166.46] humankind,
[1166.86 → 1167.36] that human
[1167.36 → 1167.96] beings were
[1167.96 → 1168.64] created for in
[1168.64 → 1169.38] the first place,
[1170.10 → 1170.60] that we were
[1170.60 → 1171.44] all created in
[1171.44 → 1172.16] the image of
[1172.16 → 1172.52] God,
[1173.68 → 1174.52] that is real
[1174.52 → 1174.82] life.
[1174.94 → 1175.42] And if you
[1175.42 → 1176.06] believe that
[1176.06 → 1177.24] this really
[1177.24 → 1178.00] is true
[1178.00 → 1178.44] life,
[1178.44 → 1179.70] the good
[1179.70 → 1180.44] news is
[1180.44 → 1180.82] that you
[1180.82 → 1181.48] belong to
[1181.48 → 1182.24] Christ Jesus.
[1183.30 → 1184.12] That is the
[1184.12 → 1184.70] faith that we
[1184.70 → 1185.24] live into.
[1186.20 → 1186.68] And if you
[1186.68 → 1187.66] belong to
[1187.66 → 1188.36] Jesus Christ,
[1188.50 → 1189.14] Paul says,
[1189.88 → 1190.26] you have
[1190.26 → 1190.84] crucified,
[1191.34 → 1192.04] or in other
[1192.04 → 1192.28] words,
[1192.54 → 1192.88] you have
[1192.88 → 1193.90] already died
[1193.90 → 1194.54] to your
[1194.54 → 1195.34] sinful nature
[1195.34 → 1196.04] along with
[1196.04 → 1196.66] its passions
[1196.66 → 1197.50] and desires.
[1198.96 → 1199.98] You already
[1199.98 → 1200.72] belong in
[1200.72 → 1201.16] his kingdom,
[1201.48 → 1201.84] and the
[1201.84 → 1202.62] calling is
[1202.62 → 1203.74] to live
[1203.74 → 1204.30] a life
[1204.30 → 1205.20] worthy of
[1205.20 → 1205.80] you're calling,
[1206.12 → 1206.88] to walk
[1206.88 → 1207.42] in step
[1207.42 → 1207.78] with the
[1207.78 → 1208.04] spirit,
[1208.22 → 1208.80] to live
[1208.80 → 1209.36] out your
[1209.36 → 1209.90] salvation,
[1210.14 → 1210.50] as Paul
[1210.50 → 1210.88] says in
[1210.88 → 1211.22] his other
[1211.22 → 1211.64] letters.
[1213.02 → 1213.36] You are
[1213.36 → 1213.98] saved by
[1213.98 → 1215.50] grace in
[1215.50 → 1216.20] Christ Jesus,
[1216.20 → 1216.56] and you
[1216.56 → 1217.16] belong to
[1217.16 → 1217.46] him,
[1217.74 → 1218.06] and the
[1218.06 → 1218.60] good news
[1218.60 → 1219.10] is that he
[1219.10 → 1219.60] will lead
[1219.60 → 1220.06] you by
[1220.06 → 1220.44] his own
[1220.44 → 1221.38] spirit to
[1221.38 → 1222.10] grow more
[1222.10 → 1222.44] and more
[1222.44 → 1223.02] like him,
[1223.36 → 1223.86] which is
[1223.86 → 1224.18] what it
[1224.18 → 1224.66] means to
[1224.66 → 1225.22] be truly
[1225.22 → 1225.80] human.
[1227.32 → 1228.18] Not out
[1228.18 → 1228.42] of our
[1228.42 → 1229.02] own strength
[1229.02 → 1229.54] and goodness,
[1229.82 → 1230.26] but by
[1230.26 → 1230.86] him who
[1230.86 → 1231.36] lives in
[1231.36 → 1231.58] me.
[1233.00 → 1233.50] This is
[1233.50 → 1233.92] what Jesus
[1233.92 → 1234.66] teaches us
[1234.66 → 1235.20] in the
[1235.20 → 1235.70] gospel of
[1235.70 → 1236.04] John,
[1236.40 → 1236.82] one of my
[1236.82 → 1237.22] favourite
[1237.22 → 1237.64] verses,
[1237.78 → 1238.66] in John
[1238.66 → 1239.36] chapter 15
[1239.36 → 1239.94] he says,
[1240.42 → 1241.14] remain in
[1241.14 → 1241.76] me as I
[1241.76 → 1242.62] also remain
[1242.62 → 1243.12] in you.
[1244.14 → 1244.94] No branch
[1244.94 → 1245.38] can bear
[1245.38 → 1245.70] what?
[1246.68 → 1247.58] Fruit by
[1247.58 → 1248.12] itself.
[1248.78 → 1249.34] It must
[1249.34 → 1249.92] remain in
[1249.92 → 1250.32] the vine.
[1250.66 → 1250.90] Neither
[1250.90 → 1251.66] can you
[1251.66 → 1252.52] bear fruit
[1252.52 → 1253.08] unless you
[1253.08 → 1253.96] remain in
[1253.96 → 1254.22] me.
[1255.06 → 1255.76] It is
[1255.76 → 1256.36] Christ
[1256.36 → 1257.00] centred.
[1258.30 → 1258.88] This is
[1258.88 → 1259.14] the fruit
[1259.14 → 1259.36] of the
[1259.36 → 1259.62] spirit.
[1260.16 → 1260.88] And Paul
[1260.88 → 1261.24] says,
[1261.44 → 1261.86] walk by
[1261.86 → 1262.34] the spirit,
[1262.66 → 1263.04] keep in
[1263.04 → 1263.70] step with
[1263.70 → 1264.10] the spirit.
[1264.24 → 1264.44] Same
[1264.44 → 1264.72] thing,
[1264.86 → 1265.66] remain in
[1265.66 → 1266.14] the vine,
[1266.14 → 1267.38] remain in
[1267.38 → 1267.80] Christ.
[1269.30 → 1269.82] That is
[1269.82 → 1270.42] living out
[1270.42 → 1271.04] our identity
[1271.04 → 1272.06] as Christians,
[1272.90 → 1273.50] as children
[1273.50 → 1274.06] of God.
[1274.60 → 1275.00] It sounds
[1275.00 → 1275.50] wonderful,
[1275.60 → 1276.08] doesn't it?
[1276.52 → 1277.14] To reflect
[1277.14 → 1277.64] this goodness
[1277.64 → 1278.02] for the
[1278.02 → 1278.28] world,
[1278.64 → 1279.16] to show
[1279.16 → 1280.00] them that's
[1280.00 → 1280.28] what it
[1280.28 → 1280.76] means to
[1280.76 → 1281.30] be really
[1281.30 → 1281.70] human.
[1283.14 → 1283.70] And then
[1283.70 → 1284.24] you go on,
[1284.28 → 1284.72] you have to
[1284.72 → 1284.96] ask the
[1284.96 → 1285.18] question,
[1285.28 → 1285.50] so what
[1285.50 → 1285.78] does that
[1285.78 → 1286.16] practically
[1286.16 → 1286.74] look like
[1286.74 → 1287.24] in our
[1287.24 → 1287.62] lives?
[1289.58 → 1290.00] Now,
[1290.04 → 1290.46] before we
[1290.46 → 1290.90] get there,
[1290.90 → 1292.24] I want
[1292.24 → 1292.56] to start
[1292.56 → 1293.08] with saying
[1293.08 → 1293.42] that I
[1293.42 → 1293.94] do not
[1293.94 → 1294.42] doubt
[1294.42 → 1295.60] that God
[1295.60 → 1296.18] has the
[1296.18 → 1297.04] power to
[1297.04 → 1297.44] perform
[1297.44 → 1298.14] miraculous
[1298.14 → 1298.76] transformation
[1298.76 → 1299.40] in our
[1299.40 → 1299.76] lives.
[1300.78 → 1301.68] That through
[1301.68 → 1302.30] his spirit's
[1302.30 → 1302.52] leading,
[1302.70 → 1302.94] we can
[1302.94 → 1303.54] experience
[1303.54 → 1304.34] drastic
[1304.34 → 1304.92] changes,
[1305.42 → 1305.82] miracles,
[1306.30 → 1306.72] whether it
[1306.72 → 1307.00] be,
[1307.32 → 1307.66] you know,
[1307.82 → 1308.28] overcoming
[1308.28 → 1308.90] addictions,
[1309.22 → 1310.06] or just
[1310.06 → 1310.58] miraculous
[1310.58 → 1311.64] events of
[1311.64 → 1311.98] healing.
[1312.98 → 1313.36] And I
[1313.36 → 1313.78] don't doubt
[1313.78 → 1314.20] that God
[1314.20 → 1314.62] has the
[1314.62 → 1314.96] power to
[1314.96 → 1315.46] do so.
[1316.02 → 1316.72] But also,
[1316.86 → 1317.28] you have to
[1317.28 → 1317.64] keep in
[1317.64 → 1317.96] mind,
[1318.42 → 1318.82] having been
[1318.82 → 1319.20] a Christian
[1319.20 → 1319.64] all my
[1319.64 → 1320.04] life,
[1320.90 → 1321.94] I think
[1321.94 → 1322.40] that it
[1322.40 → 1323.30] is just
[1323.30 → 1324.00] as important
[1324.00 → 1324.80] to emphasize
[1324.80 → 1325.52] that God
[1325.52 → 1326.44] also works
[1326.44 → 1326.76] through the
[1326.76 → 1328.10] most ordinary,
[1328.48 → 1328.96] quote-unquote,
[1329.16 → 1330.06] boring routines
[1330.06 → 1330.74] in our lives
[1330.74 → 1331.64] to bring us
[1331.64 → 1332.36] closer in
[1332.36 → 1332.94] likeness to
[1332.94 → 1333.16] him.
[1333.64 → 1334.24] It is not
[1334.24 → 1334.82] just the
[1334.82 → 1335.34] flashiness,
[1335.68 → 1336.18] it is not
[1336.18 → 1336.72] just the
[1336.72 → 1337.24] miraculous
[1337.24 → 1337.74] things that
[1337.74 → 1338.14] we get to
[1338.14 → 1339.10] see that's
[1339.10 → 1339.52] emphasized,
[1339.98 → 1340.40] but through
[1340.40 → 1341.22] every day,
[1342.54 → 1343.12] boring,
[1343.36 → 1343.72] ordinary
[1343.72 → 1344.28] routines,
[1344.42 → 1345.22] God also
[1345.22 → 1346.06] brings us
[1346.06 → 1346.76] closer to
[1346.76 → 1347.00] him.
[1348.78 → 1349.20] And these
[1349.20 → 1349.78] same old
[1349.78 → 1350.44] boring spiritual
[1350.44 → 1351.58] practice can
[1351.58 → 1352.54] include things
[1352.54 → 1353.04] like reading
[1353.04 → 1353.74] God's word
[1353.74 → 1354.08] more,
[1355.08 → 1355.82] just abiding
[1355.82 → 1356.22] in him
[1356.22 → 1356.80] through the
[1356.80 → 1357.20] word that
[1357.20 → 1357.46] he has
[1357.46 → 1358.02] gifted us
[1358.02 → 1358.36] with.
[1359.18 → 1359.86] Or whether
[1359.86 → 1360.18] it is
[1360.18 → 1360.62] fellowship
[1360.62 → 1361.20] with other
[1361.20 → 1361.74] brothers and
[1361.74 → 1362.24] sisters of
[1362.24 → 1362.56] Christ,
[1363.00 → 1363.74] making that
[1363.74 → 1364.12] effort,
[1364.32 → 1364.74] even if
[1364.74 → 1365.18] you're super
[1365.18 → 1365.74] introverted,
[1366.58 → 1367.30] just to go,
[1367.62 → 1368.06] I need
[1368.06 → 1368.98] other brothers
[1368.98 → 1369.64] and sisters,
[1370.02 → 1370.66] I need their
[1370.66 → 1371.08] support,
[1371.34 → 1371.96] I need their
[1371.96 → 1372.28] love.
[1373.98 → 1374.72] Or whether
[1374.72 → 1375.00] it is
[1375.00 → 1375.60] worshipping
[1375.60 → 1376.30] together with
[1376.30 → 1376.86] the body of
[1376.86 → 1377.40] Christ as we
[1377.40 → 1377.74] are doing
[1377.74 → 1378.08] now,
[1378.08 → 1378.88] even on
[1378.88 → 1379.20] a long
[1379.20 → 1379.62] weekend.
[1381.00 → 1381.64] Or whether
[1381.64 → 1382.02] it is
[1382.02 → 1382.62] celebrating
[1382.62 → 1383.06] the good
[1383.06 → 1383.48] news of
[1383.48 → 1384.14] the sacrifice
[1384.14 → 1384.80] of our
[1384.80 → 1385.32] Lord for
[1385.32 → 1385.90] our sins
[1385.90 → 1386.36] through
[1386.36 → 1386.80] communion
[1386.80 → 1387.12] that we
[1387.12 → 1387.50] celebrate
[1387.50 → 1387.94] together.
[1389.34 → 1389.80] And what
[1389.80 → 1390.36] I suggest
[1390.36 → 1390.80] is that
[1390.80 → 1391.08] whatever
[1391.08 → 1391.52] spiritual
[1391.52 → 1391.96] practice
[1391.96 → 1392.44] comes to
[1392.44 → 1392.86] mind for
[1392.86 → 1393.06] you,
[1393.26 → 1393.68] at the
[1393.68 → 1394.40] base of
[1394.40 → 1394.78] it all,
[1394.94 → 1395.70] of everything
[1395.70 → 1396.14] that we
[1396.14 → 1396.48] do,
[1397.00 → 1397.34] as we
[1397.34 → 1397.94] walk in
[1397.94 → 1398.32] step with
[1398.32 → 1398.74] the Spirit,
[1398.98 → 1399.60] it has
[1399.60 → 1400.00] to be
[1400.00 → 1400.48] soaked
[1400.48 → 1400.86] in
[1400.86 → 1401.40] prayer.
[1403.54 → 1404.16] In the
[1404.16 → 1404.66] words of
[1404.66 → 1404.94] J.I.
[1405.04 → 1405.44] Packer that
[1405.44 → 1405.78] I quoted
[1405.78 → 1406.46] earlier on,
[1406.92 → 1407.26] he says
[1407.26 → 1407.48] this,
[1407.56 → 1407.96] it's a
[1407.96 → 1408.38] lengthier
[1408.38 → 1408.68] quote,
[1408.78 → 1409.04] but I
[1409.04 → 1409.74] thought this
[1409.74 → 1410.34] just captured
[1410.34 → 1410.94] it so well.
[1411.92 → 1412.44] He says,
[1412.82 → 1413.16] holiness
[1413.16 → 1413.78] teaching,
[1414.46 → 1414.84] so whenever
[1414.84 → 1415.26] you teach
[1415.26 → 1415.58] about the
[1415.58 → 1416.82] holiness and
[1416.82 → 1417.28] living a
[1417.28 → 1417.64] life in
[1417.64 → 1418.10] step with
[1418.10 → 1418.52] the Spirit,
[1419.46 → 1420.18] if that
[1420.18 → 1420.58] teaching
[1420.58 → 1421.38] skips over
[1421.38 → 1421.86] discipline,
[1422.02 → 1422.48] persistence,
[1422.72 → 1422.94] and the
[1422.94 → 1423.54] well-doing
[1423.54 → 1424.30] that forms
[1424.30 → 1425.18] holy habits,
[1425.82 → 1426.26] if you're
[1426.26 → 1426.94] missing that,
[1427.12 → 1427.42] if you're
[1427.42 → 1428.22] missing the
[1428.22 → 1429.14] ordinary habits
[1429.14 → 1429.94] in holiness
[1429.94 → 1430.52] teachings,
[1431.04 → 1431.70] it is thus
[1431.70 → 1432.18] weak.
[1433.36 → 1433.98] He says,
[1434.24 → 1435.10] habit-forming
[1435.10 → 1436.14] is the Spirit's
[1436.14 → 1437.00] ordinary way
[1437.00 → 1437.42] of leading
[1437.42 → 1438.18] us on
[1438.18 → 1438.96] in holiness.
[1440.20 → 1440.66] The fruit
[1440.66 → 1441.20] of the Spirit
[1441.20 → 1441.68] itself,
[1441.80 → 1442.24] from one
[1442.24 → 1442.84] standpoint,
[1443.18 → 1443.70] is a series
[1443.70 → 1444.32] of habits
[1444.32 → 1445.06] of action
[1445.06 → 1445.90] and reaction,
[1446.36 → 1446.92] and he lists
[1446.92 → 1447.58] the fruit
[1447.58 → 1447.98] of the Spirit
[1447.98 → 1448.58] from Galatians
[1448.58 → 1448.90] 5,
[1448.96 → 1449.26] from our
[1449.26 → 1449.72] passage,
[1450.06 → 1450.68] and he says
[1450.68 → 1451.14] that these
[1451.14 → 1451.62] are all
[1451.62 → 1452.16] habitual
[1452.16 → 1453.24] dispositions,
[1453.68 → 1454.12] that is,
[1454.20 → 1454.78] accustomed
[1454.78 → 1455.72] ways of
[1455.72 → 1456.12] thinking,
[1456.58 → 1456.86] feeling,
[1457.08 → 1457.72] and behaving.
[1459.32 → 1459.88] So,
[1460.16 → 1460.84] all our
[1460.84 → 1461.48] attempts to
[1461.48 → 1461.82] get our
[1461.82 → 1462.48] lives in
[1462.48 → 1463.44] shape need
[1463.44 → 1463.98] to be
[1463.98 → 1464.72] soaked
[1464.72 → 1465.78] in constant
[1465.78 → 1466.28] prayer,
[1466.76 → 1467.94] that acknowledges
[1467.94 → 1468.62] our inability
[1468.62 → 1469.34] to change
[1469.34 → 1469.88] ourselves,
[1470.20 → 1470.54] and in
[1470.54 → 1471.30] thanksgiving,
[1471.70 → 1472.66] recognizes that
[1472.66 → 1473.60] every virtue
[1473.60 → 1474.20] we possess,
[1474.82 → 1475.72] every victory
[1475.72 → 1476.16] won,
[1476.72 → 1477.48] every even
[1477.48 → 1478.34] thought of
[1478.34 → 1478.74] holiness,
[1479.52 → 1480.38] are his,
[1480.78 → 1481.22] are the
[1481.22 → 1481.84] Spirit's
[1481.84 → 1482.20] alone.
[1484.82 → 1485.58] So,
[1485.72 → 1486.34] as we enter
[1486.34 → 1486.98] into these
[1486.98 → 1487.94] relatively slower
[1487.94 → 1488.96] summer months,
[1489.24 → 1490.14] the question I
[1490.14 → 1490.80] want to encourage
[1490.80 → 1491.34] us to think
[1491.34 → 1491.92] about is,
[1491.92 → 1493.14] what is
[1493.14 → 1493.96] tugging at
[1493.96 → 1494.48] your heart?
[1495.68 → 1496.16] What
[1496.16 → 1496.68] spiritual
[1496.68 → 1497.54] practices or
[1497.54 → 1498.24] disciplines that
[1498.24 → 1498.80] I may be
[1498.80 → 1499.10] named,
[1499.36 → 1500.20] or things
[1500.20 → 1500.70] that you've
[1500.70 → 1501.74] already have
[1501.74 → 1502.34] been doing,
[1502.48 → 1503.12] or you're
[1503.12 → 1503.94] thinking about,
[1504.86 → 1505.36] which of
[1505.36 → 1506.24] this excites
[1506.24 → 1506.48] you,
[1507.30 → 1507.86] that you
[1507.86 → 1508.48] really want
[1508.48 → 1508.80] to do,
[1508.94 → 1509.30] especially
[1509.30 → 1509.88] this summer?
[1511.12 → 1511.52] In other
[1511.52 → 1511.88] words,
[1512.28 → 1512.94] what is the
[1512.94 → 1513.90] Spirit inspiring
[1513.90 → 1514.58] you to do
[1514.58 → 1515.22] more of?
[1516.40 → 1517.12] And on the
[1517.12 → 1517.62] other flip
[1517.62 → 1518.26] side of that,
[1518.58 → 1519.22] what is the
[1519.22 → 1520.12] Spirit convicting
[1520.12 → 1520.94] you to do
[1520.94 → 1521.90] less of?
[1521.92 → 1525.38] And the
[1525.38 → 1526.42] encouragement on
[1526.42 → 1527.12] top of that,
[1527.24 → 1527.74] or at the
[1527.74 → 1528.44] base of that,
[1528.74 → 1529.24] is that in
[1529.24 → 1529.92] order to even
[1529.92 → 1530.90] start to feel
[1530.90 → 1531.96] and sense the
[1531.96 → 1532.96] Spirit's inspiration
[1532.96 → 1533.54] and leading,
[1534.40 → 1535.26] we need to
[1535.26 → 1535.52] pray.
[1537.16 → 1538.16] Our church
[1538.16 → 1538.92] as a body
[1538.92 → 1539.76] needs to
[1539.76 → 1540.02] pray.
[1541.96 → 1542.64] In our
[1542.64 → 1543.42] staff and
[1543.42 → 1543.90] in our
[1543.90 → 1544.38] leadership
[1544.38 → 1544.88] meetings,
[1545.26 → 1545.96] I remember
[1545.96 → 1546.76] somebody mentioning
[1546.76 → 1547.36] that there is
[1547.36 → 1547.94] a rumbling,
[1548.42 → 1549.06] there is a
[1549.06 → 1550.30] growing desire
[1550.30 → 1552.30] to pray more
[1552.30 → 1552.90] within our
[1552.90 → 1553.24] church.
[1554.02 → 1554.28] And I've
[1554.28 → 1555.32] sensed that
[1555.32 → 1555.58] too.
[1555.96 → 1556.56] Whenever one of
[1556.56 → 1557.00] the preachers
[1557.00 → 1557.70] here come up
[1557.70 → 1558.38] and they
[1558.38 → 1559.26] emphasize the
[1559.26 → 1559.80] importance of
[1559.80 → 1560.06] prayer,
[1560.98 → 1561.92] I sense a lot
[1561.92 → 1562.58] of head nodding
[1562.58 → 1563.58] and a lot of
[1563.58 → 1564.40] resonance within
[1564.40 → 1565.34] our church
[1565.34 → 1565.76] congregation.
[1566.44 → 1567.20] We feel this
[1567.20 → 1568.36] shared desire
[1568.36 → 1568.88] for prayer.
[1568.88 → 1568.92] prayer.
[1571.64 → 1572.42] We need
[1572.42 → 1573.68] prayer and
[1573.68 → 1574.12] we need to
[1574.12 → 1574.80] keep in
[1574.80 → 1575.28] step,
[1575.62 → 1576.22] as Paul says
[1576.22 → 1576.40] it,
[1576.68 → 1577.40] with God,
[1577.76 → 1578.26] with His
[1578.26 → 1578.64] Spirit,
[1578.98 → 1579.84] through prayer.
[1580.72 → 1581.40] Be open
[1581.40 → 1582.52] and ask
[1582.52 → 1583.14] and welcome
[1583.14 → 1583.76] the Spirit
[1583.76 → 1585.22] as He leads
[1585.22 → 1585.74] us in our
[1585.74 → 1586.52] lives to
[1586.52 → 1587.26] become more
[1587.26 → 1587.58] and more
[1587.58 → 1588.38] Christ-like
[1588.38 → 1588.92] in our
[1588.92 → 1589.28] lives,
[1590.08 → 1590.48] to be
[1590.48 → 1591.44] blessed to
[1591.44 → 1591.68] be a
[1591.68 → 1592.02] blessing.
[1592.92 → 1593.42] And so
[1593.42 → 1594.42] Sid is
[1594.42 → 1595.10] actually not
[1595.10 → 1595.52] stealing from
[1595.52 → 1595.96] my sermon,
[1596.08 → 1596.42] but he's
[1596.42 → 1596.88] stealing from
[1596.88 → 1597.44] my blessing
[1597.44 → 1597.98] at the end
[1597.98 → 1598.68] of the
[1598.68 → 1599.78] service today.
[1599.90 → 1600.28] And so
[1600.28 → 1601.28] I want to
[1601.28 → 1601.68] leave you
[1601.68 → 1602.04] at the end
[1602.04 → 1602.62] of my sermon
[1602.62 → 1603.24] here with
[1603.24 → 1603.62] a blessing
[1603.62 → 1605.20] from 2 Thessalonians
[1605.20 → 1606.06] which I think
[1606.06 → 1606.86] is so appropriate.
[1607.24 → 1607.54] And at this
[1607.54 → 1607.96] time I'm
[1607.96 → 1608.42] actually going
[1608.42 → 1609.00] to ask the
[1609.00 → 1609.46] worship team
[1609.46 → 1609.98] to come up
[1609.98 → 1610.66] because this
[1610.66 → 1610.96] is going
[1610.96 → 1611.56] to be a
[1611.56 → 1612.50] closing prayer
[1612.50 → 1612.98] for us
[1612.98 → 1613.30] as a
[1613.30 → 1613.62] blessing.
[1614.72 → 1615.26] So hear
[1615.26 → 1615.72] the words
[1615.72 → 1616.26] from Paul
[1616.26 → 1617.72] from 2 Thessalonians
[1617.72 → 1618.96] where he says,
[1619.62 → 1620.32] we constantly
[1620.32 → 1621.18] pray for you
[1621.18 → 1621.78] brothers and
[1621.78 → 1622.72] sisters of hope
[1622.72 → 1624.18] that our God
[1624.18 → 1624.96] may make you
[1624.96 → 1625.86] worthy of His
[1625.86 → 1626.76] calling and
[1626.76 → 1627.62] that by His
[1627.62 → 1628.46] power He
[1628.46 → 1629.28] may bring to
[1629.28 → 1630.46] fruition your
[1630.46 → 1631.66] every desire
[1631.66 → 1632.26] for goodness
[1632.26 → 1633.12] and your
[1633.12 → 1634.30] every deed
[1634.30 → 1635.56] prompted by
[1635.56 → 1636.00] faith.
[1636.82 → 1637.26] Amen.
[1638.22 → 1639.24] I invite you
[1639.24 → 1639.92] to stand as
[1639.92 → 1640.96] we sing our
[1640.96 → 1641.86] song of response.
[1642.08 → 1642.96] We invite God
[1642.96 → 1644.20] to reign in us.
[1644.20 → 1644.34] Amen.
[1644.34 → 1644.70] Amen.
[1644.70 → 1644.84] Amen.
[1644.84 → 1645.34] Amen.
[1645.34 → 1645.84] Amen.
[1645.84 → 1646.34] Amen.
[1646.34 → 1646.84] Amen.
[1646.84 → 1647.34] Amen.
[1647.34 → 1647.40] Amen.
[1647.40 → 1647.84] Amen.
[1647.84 → 1648.84] Amen.
[1648.84 → 1649.84] Amen.
[1649.84 → 1650.84] Amen.
[1650.84 → 1651.84] Amen.
[1651.84 → 1652.84] Amen.
[1652.84 → 1652.88] Amen.
[1652.88 → 1653.84] Amen.
[1653.84 → 1654.84] Amen.
[1654.84 → 1655.84] Amen.
[1655.84 → 1656.84] Amen.
[1656.84 → 1656.88] Amen.
[1656.88 → 1656.92] Amen.
[1656.92 → 1656.94] Amen.
