[0.00 → 13.56] well good morning everyone we are going to continue our series on how we are called to
[13.56 → 17.72] be a contrast community in the midst of our city and if you're here last week Jonathan
[17.72 → 21.72] used this line that we've repeated a few times when we are called to love our city so deeply
[21.72 → 26.40] that we stand against its idols we've looked at what it means to be a community of rest
[26.40 → 33.74] in a culture of exhaustion a community of justice in a culture of self-focus a community of well this
[33.74 → 38.86] is actually next week a community of upright speech in a culture of gossip and using our words
[38.86 → 45.32] poorly, but today we're looking at what it means to be a community of holy living in a culture of you
[45.32 → 50.72] do you, and so we're going to look at our bodies and our sexuality, and it's going to be an interesting
[50.72 → 56.46] sermon if you have your bibles turn with me to first Corinthians 6 where Paul addresses a church
[56.46 → 60.52] quite like ours in many ways on the issue of sexual immorality
[60.52 → 74.90] I have the right to do anything you say but not everything is beneficial I have the right to do
[74.90 → 81.74] anything but I will not be mastered by anything you say food for the stomach and stomach for the food
[81.74 → 88.18] and god will destroy them both the body however is not meant for sexual immorality but for the lord
[88.18 → 95.56] and the lord for the body by his power god raised the lord from the dead, and he will raise us also
[95.56 → 102.38] do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself shall I then take members of Christ and
[102.38 → 109.08] unite them with a prostitute never do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is
[109.08 → 116.46] one with her in body for it is said the two will become one flesh but whoever is united with the lord
[116.46 → 124.86] is one with him in spirit flee from sexual immorality all other sins people commit are outside the bodies but
[124.86 → 131.34] those who sin sexually sin against their own bodies do you not know that your bodies are temples of the
[131.34 → 140.58] Holy Spirit who is in you and whom you have received from god you are not your own you were bought at a
[140.58 → 146.04] price therefore honour god with your bodies this is god's word
[146.04 → 153.64] so a couple of years ago there's a TV series that came out called Ted lasso
[153.64 → 161.00] and the couple in our church uh recommended to Britney and i the series is based on the premise of a mediocre
[161.00 → 164.74] uh but overly optimistic college football coach
[164.74 → 169.64] who gets called up to coach soccer in England about which he knows nothing
[169.64 → 174.92] and there's one particular episode where everything is going against the coach Ted lasso
[174.92 → 179.70] his team is doing terribly the city has turned against him and to top it all off
[179.70 → 185.78] his wife uh sent him divorce papers that he now needs to sign and in this episode he goes to the
[185.78 → 191.46] pub has a few drinks goes back to his room and signs the divorce documents and just after that
[191.46 → 196.46] happens there's a knock at the door and there's this woman a friend of his bosses that he barely
[196.46 → 202.24] knows who come in things lead to things, and they end up sleeping together the next morning he gets up
[202.24 → 206.40] awkwardly and leaves because he doesn't know her very well, and he goes to his office at the clubhouse
[206.40 → 209.80] and then he brings his assistant coaches in for a special meeting
[209.80 → 215.94] in this meeting he simply says I feel terribly about what I just did
[215.94 → 221.34] I just signed these divorce papers I just slept with this woman I barely know it's a one-night stand
[221.34 → 226.50] and I feel so guilty about what happened after he finishes one of the assistant coaches looks at him
[226.50 → 232.40] and says Ted did you have fun, and he looks at him and says yeah
[232.40 → 240.48] the other assistant coach asks him well did she have fun he's like yeah and then the first coach
[240.48 → 246.10] looks at him and says well then what's the problem here and that's the end of the conversation
[246.10 → 254.08] I want to suggest to you in that very short even insignificant dialogue a very powerful narrative
[254.08 → 260.96] from our culture was reinforced about sex intimacy and about our bodies more broadly and the
[260.96 → 266.52] narrative is so baked into our culture you barely would even notice it if you were to watch the
[266.52 → 276.68] episode, but the narrative is this if it feels good go for it if you want to have fun have adder
[276.68 → 285.40] it's your body do what you like and as disciples of Jesus living in what I would describe and I bet
[285.40 → 290.94] you would agree an over-sexed culture we now have the opportunity this morning to sit at the feet of
[290.96 → 297.52] Jesus and listen to him teach us by his word through a letter to a church that can relate to
[297.52 → 303.46] us on a few levels now sometimes the churches in the New Testament they're very different from ours
[303.46 → 308.52] and there are ways in which Corinth is not like us but I would suggest of all the churches that i
[308.52 → 315.46] could pick to be similar to Canada and maybe a church in surrey it would be Corinth fairly affluent
[315.46 → 324.04] city port city uh fairly high levels of education, and they loved their freedom they loved doing what
[324.04 → 329.24] they wanted to do, and we're now going to listen to Jesus instruct them by his word through this letter
[329.24 → 337.04] and realize as we listen that discipleship to Jesus is not just ideas we have about god and about Jesus it's
[337.04 → 342.96] actually the way we live in our bodies because that's really the centre of this whole passage so
[342.96 → 346.50] let's take a look together you ready for this it's not going to be a short sermon I don't apologize
[346.50 → 352.78] for that, but this is how Paul starts he says I have the right to do anything, and now he's quoting
[352.78 → 358.42] them you say but not everything is beneficial I have the right to do anything but I will not be
[358.42 → 364.12] mastered by anything now to make sense of what he's saying here there's two really important pieces
[364.12 → 371.56] of context that we need to understand number one Paul is quoting a famous slogan Corinth likely would
[371.56 → 376.04] have this slogan on the city walls it would likely be well known by people in Corinth, and it was this
[376.04 → 381.98] liberty to do all things or freedom to do all things I don't know about you but when I hear that phrase i
[381.98 → 388.20] think man that sounds American doesn't it not just me and so what the problem he's facing is you've got
[388.20 → 394.24] these Christians who heard him preach you're free in Christ free from the law free from guilt free from
[394.24 → 398.84] sin, but they're living in a city that says you're free to do whatever you want and the Christians did what
[398.84 → 403.78] many of us are tempted to do all the time fuse these things together and like I am free in Jesus
[403.78 → 412.14] to do whatever I want added one layer deeper this is how most people in the Greek and Roman world
[412.14 → 419.16] thought about bodies their view was that inside of us is a thing called the soul and that soul is
[419.16 → 425.36] imperishable it's eternal it's very important and at one point in life when you die that soul goes to
[425.36 → 430.42] sort of be with the divine the body though according to the first century way of thinking is just a
[430.42 → 437.12] shell for the soul right it's decaying it gets sick it eventually you shed your body and so the body
[437.12 → 442.54] doesn't matter and why this matters for us is for people in Corinth and many surrounding cities it
[442.54 → 448.22] didn't matter how you lived in your bodies you can kind of do what you want to eat what you want to go where
[448.22 → 454.20] you want and sleep with who you want it's just a body and interestingly I won't have time to say this
[454.20 → 458.84] today there are several writers who are saying there's actually a very similar view of the body
[458.84 → 463.64] that people in our society are adopting it's just a body I'm something inside my body that's separate
[463.64 → 470.40] from it and therefore the body's not all that important and so interestingly Paul has to address
[470.40 → 474.94] some pretty serious stuff in this passage and not just this passage but ones around it specifically
[474.94 → 480.62] the sleeping with prostitutes that's happening in the church but the way he does it is fascinating to
[480.62 → 485.98] me because you know what Paul focuses on in most of this passage the body in fact the most repeated
[485.98 → 492.08] word is soma in Greek which is English the body and how does Paul finish this passage by saying to them
[492.08 → 498.36] as strongly as he can therefore in light of everything I've said honour god with your bodies
[498.36 → 506.16] and then he works out how that works out sexually so let's take a look first at what Paul says about the
[506.16 → 513.78] beauty and the goodness of the body let's start in verse 13 to 15 he writes the body however is not
[513.78 → 518.58] meant for sexual immorality we're going to get to that in just a minute but for the lord and the lord
[518.58 → 526.20] for the body by his power god raised the lord from the dead, and he will raise us also do you not know
[526.20 → 533.86] that your bodies are members of Christ himself and what Paul is saying is discipleship to Jesus is taking
[533.86 → 539.76] on a whole new story of how we understand our bodies as Christians and I really believe that I can't
[539.76 → 544.90] talk about this passage without going right back to genesis which Paul himself does because for anyone
[544.90 → 551.44] who follows Jesus and reads his word we have to come to terms with the fact that our bodies are good
[551.44 → 559.26] that god delights in our bodies you read genesis 1 every part of creation as god finishes that the land
[559.26 → 564.66] the water the air all that he created it says it is good and god did not save half-hearted work
[564.66 → 571.20] for the end where he creates humanity he was delighted to form and fashion and breathe life
[571.20 → 578.38] into humanity men and women who reflect his image, and he thinks it is good to have a body
[578.38 → 585.18] and I like what run writer says in the bible we don't just have bodies we are bodies are part
[585.18 → 590.68] of what it means for us to be human we are bodies and god delights in them so that's the first piece
[590.68 → 596.62] that's built into this passage and just so you know it's really important to point this out when we
[596.62 → 601.88] rebel against god, and we reject his authority in genesis 3 what's fascinating is god doesn't destroy
[601.88 → 607.52] humans if you read other creation accounts from other religions in ancient near east the gods actually
[607.52 → 612.50] do destroy humans in their stories, but our god in the true story sets out on this long road of
[612.50 → 619.38] redemption this long road of making things right that involves get this god taking on a body
[619.38 → 624.94] the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us, and you should know that against over and against
[624.94 → 630.74] many religions specifically eastern religions Christianity is crazy because they could not fathom
[630.74 → 636.22] why in the world an eternal god would take on this perishable shell of a body but in Christianity
[636.22 → 644.86] that's at the centre of it god becoming flesh taking on a body because god believes the body is good and
[644.86 → 650.88] so must we, but that's just the beginning of what Paul is saying then he goes on to say by faith you and i
[650.88 → 656.78] are united to Christ we are his body and Andre actually mentioned that with the hands and the feet of Jesus
[656.78 → 662.28] Paul says that in first Corinthians 12 we are the limbs and the organs of Jesus that we are intimately
[662.28 → 667.90] connected to him that we are in him and Jesus dwells in us and did you notice what Paul says
[667.90 → 676.08] later in this passage do you not know that you are temples of the Holy Spirit now if you grew up in
[676.08 → 680.36] the church that language is probably just normal to you but can I just invite you to let it blow your
[680.36 → 689.94] mind that you and I are inhabited and indwelt by the living god by his Holy Spirit right now god lives
[689.94 → 696.44] in you such that when you move god moves when you act god is with you god dwells in you and i actually
[696.44 → 702.40] think a big step in us living differently is recognizing that the living god is alive in us
[702.40 → 708.62] and through us that is powerful stuff and if that weren't enough Paul just throws in the middle of this
[708.62 → 715.16] passage oh by the way the body that Jesus took on god rose from the grave and yours also by faith in
[715.16 → 719.74] Jesus will rise from the grave and if you're new to Christianity, or you're new to our church and how
[719.74 → 726.72] we teach about Christianity you have a resurrected future awaiting you if you believe in Christ we're
[726.72 → 730.88] not going to be ghosts forever that float around without bodies Jesus rose from the dead and those
[730.88 → 737.30] who believe in him will rise with him with perfect bodies purified and made whole to live in a purified
[737.30 → 743.86] and whole creation forever and all the stuff that you love about life in your body you get to enjoy
[743.86 → 750.08] forever amen indeed I actually said the 9 a.m this is the point where you say amen, so someone must
[750.08 → 755.46] maybe you're in the 9 a.m you still love the sermon on sex that you came back for another one
[755.46 → 762.70] you know last week uh on Friday I was reading about the goodness of the body and the difference
[762.70 → 766.94] between a Christian view of the body and other religions, and we took a break as staff, and we went
[766.94 → 770.60] to go visit mike and Hillary avian I don't know if they're in this service because they just had a baby
[770.60 → 775.32] and I got the whole little baby Mila and I had a very moving experience thinking like wow god
[775.32 → 782.08] babies are miracles bodies are miracles and I can only speak for myself you know I've had a few kids
[782.08 → 786.24] and I've held all my children it's been always an emotional experience, but there's something I can
[786.24 → 790.58] only speak for dads you know when you hold that child that you were part of the process right that
[790.58 → 795.22] brought them into the world, but you also know you got more than you bargained for and more than you
[795.22 → 800.42] could take credit for am I wrong tell me I'm wrong you hold this child, and you just praise the lord
[800.42 → 806.38] there's nothing short of a miracle in your arms this living breathing body that god and his love
[806.38 → 812.60] and his power brought into your life every child is a miracle there is no scientific explanation for
[812.60 → 818.72] how it all comes to be and why it comes to be other than that god is the giver of life and bodies
[818.72 → 826.30] are beautiful and in his image praise the lord it's out of this now you're I hope you're tracking
[826.30 → 831.44] with me, it's out of Paul's high view of the body over and against a Greek view that is just a shell
[831.44 → 838.00] for the soul Paul's saying god dwells in your bodies by the spirits you're united to Jesus and if that's
[838.00 → 844.72] true how you live out your sexuality is of great importance in the life you have, and now he gets down
[844.72 → 852.86] to business on sexual immorality now in scriptures um sexuality sexual immorality is mentioned a lot
[852.86 → 856.78] and if you're aware of current church debates around sexuality you need to know that the phrase
[856.78 → 862.98] sexual immorality has a lot of conversation around it but let me summarize it this way I believe sexual
[862.98 → 869.72] immorality all the times it's used in the New Testament is shorthand for describing all sexual activity
[869.72 → 875.56] outside the covenant of marriage okay it's all the different forms of sexual activity outside the
[875.56 → 881.16] covenant of marriage Paul uses it in many different places in fact uh you should read today or if this
[881.16 → 885.44] week if you're really interested in doing a deeper dive on this read just first Corinthians 6 and 7
[885.44 → 891.60] because Paul addresses a lot of different stuff he addresses adultery he addresses fornication
[891.60 → 897.66] same-sex sex he addresses um incest within the families he goes after all these different things
[897.66 → 902.36] and he brings the gospel to bear on them read it for yourself but Paul is very interested in allowing
[902.36 → 908.92] people to work out how to follow Jesus with their bodies and their sexuality so let's read the specific
[908.92 → 913.46] thing he addresses in this passage which is temple prostitution and before I read the passage
[913.46 → 917.84] helpful to frame what's going on in the cities then this is very different from today
[917.84 → 923.62] um prostitution was linked with temples uh there are places where you'd worship a god there would be food
[923.62 → 928.32] idols uh food and feasts as part of that that's why food is mentioned in our passage as well because
[928.32 → 933.72] food temple prostitution they go together in these places of worship and uh the Christians were clearly
[933.72 → 937.82] going to the temples they used to worship at because they were free and then enjoy the prostitutes that
[937.82 → 943.02] were available there and Paul's got something to say about it and this is what he says verse 15
[943.02 → 950.20] I think you'll have the context for it in on the screen too he writes do you not know that he who
[950.20 → 958.66] unites himself with the prostitute is one with her in body for it has said the two will become one
[958.66 → 964.62] flesh and just to remind us of the movement because we are united to Jesus by faith in our bodies Paul's
[964.62 → 970.40] now saying if it's Jesus you're following his design established by the father in the scriptures is now how
[970.40 → 977.62] you are to live and what does he quote anyone know the passage he quotes genesis 224 which is widely
[977.62 → 984.18] accepted as the foundational marriage passage on sexuality and I'll read it for us in genesis 224
[984.18 → 991.48] with Jesus himself quotes in Matthew 19 we read that is why a man leaves his father and mother and is
[991.48 → 999.50] united to his wife, and they become one flesh now I've done a lot of weddings in the last few years
[999.50 → 1004.06] I hope and I've got three more in the hopper next year I praise the lord for that and at every wedding
[1004.06 → 1008.88] I do I say to the couple you should know that I'm going to give a definition of marriage because it's
[1008.88 → 1012.04] important that people know how Christians view marriage and I say the same thing at every wedding
[1012.04 → 1020.56] marriage is a unique covenant lifelong bond between a husband and a wife and that in this passage is the
[1020.56 → 1027.58] beautiful safe relationship that god gives the gift of sex to that's the safe-committed relationship
[1027.58 → 1033.00] where sex can be enjoyed explored and the means by which god brings forth the miracle of new life
[1033.00 → 1038.84] we read that in genesis 2, and it's quoted all over the New Testament and the reason this matters for
[1038.84 → 1044.18] Paul at this moment is because if you realize that sex bond is like this one fleshed union between two
[1044.18 → 1049.74] covenant partners all of a sudden this one moment this one activity with a prostitute is such a betrayal
[1049.74 → 1056.34] of god's design he's almost saying do you not know what sex is do you not know how god designed this to
[1056.34 → 1060.56] be part of this committed safe relationship, and you're just flippantly going to this temple and
[1060.56 → 1065.00] sleeping with someone you don't even know aren't committed to and have no desire to be lifelong
[1065.00 → 1072.60] bonded with in physical ways and spiritual ways and all the rest there's a professor I know who as he's
[1072.60 → 1077.24] gotten older he's been sort of listening carefully to how our culture is talking about sexuality and of
[1077.24 → 1082.80] course as you know there's a lot of conversation around sexuality in our culture, and he specifically was
[1082.80 → 1087.08] lamenting something, and he's he was noticing people my age and younger he's probably in his
[1087.08 → 1093.62] late 60s early 70s and millennial parents we have to wade into some complicated conversations right as
[1093.62 → 1098.46] Christians as well about LGBT about gender identity, and we're just trying to figure out how to speak
[1098.46 → 1104.74] wisely and lovingly truthfully and graciously into these things, and it's not easy I speak as a parent
[1104.74 → 1110.20] myself, but his lament is as we wrestle with all these things as people debate all these things
[1110.20 → 1117.14] his concern was nobody is teaching children the beauty of sex that god designed for married couples
[1117.14 → 1122.08] no one's holding out before them this vision that leads to a flourishing life and marriage, and he says
[1122.08 → 1127.34] in all the debate in all the confusion no one's speaking to our kids about god's design, and so I say to
[1127.34 → 1133.18] you parent specifically how's that conversation going maybe it's time to have that conversation
[1133.18 → 1138.30] because there's a lot worse people who could have it with your kids, and it should be you
[1138.30 → 1145.46] now I'm going to spend some time on verse 18 where Paul gives I think a forceful exhortation to the
[1145.46 → 1155.88] church where he simply says at the beginning flee sexual immorality flee all the forms of temptation
[1155.88 → 1162.58] all the forms of sex that will lure you away from god's design for sex that he established in the
[1162.58 → 1168.94] beginning whether you're young or old whether you're single dating married and married for years
[1168.94 → 1175.00] flee sexual immorality and I will quote another teacher of mine Sarah Williams who said we as
[1175.00 → 1181.24] Christians must never think that fidelity in a marriage is easier than chastity before marriage
[1181.24 → 1184.92] I think that needs to be underscored because sometimes in the Christian world you think okay
[1184.92 → 1189.14] as long as i I find a way to not sleep with anyone before I get married it's going to be great and
[1189.14 → 1193.10] then you get married you're as actually there's a lot of temptation there are a lot of challenges
[1193.10 → 1197.70] there's a lot of opportunity to break that covenant and sleep outside the marriage bed
[1197.70 → 1205.82] Corinth was tempted in this passage by the prostitution that was readily available at the temple
[1205.82 → 1213.00] where are we tempted I want to suggest to you that we live as I mentioned in Ted lasso
[1213.00 → 1218.78] in a society that says it's your body have fun it's just a body do what you feel like doing
[1218.78 → 1225.00] as long as it's consensual we live in a society that further than that encourages the experimentation
[1225.00 → 1229.80] of our sexuality you don't really know what you like you don't really know who you want to be with
[1229.80 → 1234.02] so sleep with different partner try different things out kind of figure out for yourself who
[1234.02 → 1239.54] you're compatible with how you feel sexually comfortable with all the rest and even one step
[1239.54 → 1244.96] further I would say that our society has flipped the script on the Christian ethic for marriage and
[1244.96 → 1249.84] sexuality in such a way that they say freedom is sleeping with whoever you want whenever you want
[1249.84 → 1255.74] however you'd like and slavery is marriage right and there are all sorts of jokes that I don't like
[1255.74 → 1259.84] making about marriage about being locked down the world's smallest uh what is it world's smallest
[1259.84 → 1264.82] handcuff all that stuff there's a there's a narrative in our society that says the slavery is actually the
[1264.82 → 1270.00] marriage right and that's not to mention something else that the Corinthian church could never have
[1270.00 → 1276.72] even fathomed and that's what we have to face with on these things right they could never have
[1276.72 → 1283.56] imagined that people in our society in our city would have anonymous unlimited free access to some
[1283.56 → 1287.90] of the most destructive forms of pornography actually all forms of pornography are destructive
[1287.90 → 1295.46] that destroy families destroy marriages destroy our own souls and we may not think oh I'm never going
[1295.46 → 1300.58] to go to a temple prostitute but we have digital fornication digital adultery and all the studies
[1300.58 → 1304.92] show that the feeling a spouse has when they find out that their spouse is looking at porn is similar
[1304.92 → 1312.78] to that of the betrayal of adultery the feelings are the same and what I want to say in my own experience
[1312.78 → 1318.38] and most certainly my pastoral experience here this fall it's worth the so-called sexual liberation
[1318.38 → 1323.42] that our society celebrates is not freedom
[1323.42 → 1329.34] we live in a society that very similar to Corinth is saying hey free to do whatever we want
[1329.34 → 1334.10] and us pastors and not even pastors like psychologists and therapists who aren't even Christians are saying
[1334.10 → 1339.90] can we just put our finger on something here there's so much brokenness and shame and guilt
[1339.90 → 1343.88] and broken relationships that are coming out of our free sexual society
[1343.88 → 1348.30] and we're learning that all the stuff we have access to is actually leaving us in slavery
[1348.30 → 1349.76] would you agree
[1349.76 → 1355.32] and I don't think I need to convince you of that I think so much of us know that slavery in our own lives
[1355.32 → 1359.90] we know the pain and the loneliness that comes with all these avenues to explore
[1359.90 → 1366.46] the one-night stand destroys decade-long marriages the habitual use of porn leaves us feeling empty and lonely
[1366.46 → 1372.68] ashamed and longing for real relationships the hookup culture of tinder leaves us hungering for something
[1372.68 → 1374.78] that has more than just two bodies connecting
[1374.78 → 1377.76] but deep meaningful covenant
[1377.76 → 1382.94] it's and it's 11 a.m. service so I'm just going to share this story we're just going to go long is that okay
[1382.94 → 1386.60] I remember sitting on the bus on the way back from regent when I was studying there
[1386.60 → 1391.40] and there's I was on the back of the 99 if you're on the 99 it's the accordion big long accordion bus
[1391.40 → 1395.26] and I was sitting in the back and these two young females sat beside me there
[1395.26 → 1399.18] you know probably UBC students and one I could tell right away she was crying
[1399.18 → 1404.78] and she was trying to speak quietly to her friend but I could hear everything they were saying because she was so upset
[1404.78 → 1408.54] and the reason she was so upset is that her boyfriend kept texting her late at night
[1408.54 → 1411.38] so that he could come over and sleep with her and then he'd leave right away
[1411.38 → 1414.38] and she would say to she said to her friend this is almost a direct quote
[1414.38 → 1417.72] doesn't he know I'm more than just sex
[1417.72 → 1418.90] I was like wow
[1418.90 → 1424.32] this is the nature of sexuality in our society I realize that's not every couple but I just realized
[1424.32 → 1429.80] that's what young people are facing now how do I invite this person to a real relationship that's committed
[1429.80 → 1431.10] not just for the body
[1431.10 → 1435.50] now I have a theory and I can't prove it but I'm pretty sure it's going to be right
[1435.50 → 1437.48] we have a society that will keep pushing
[1437.48 → 1442.28] redefining what sex is redefining what's okay redefining what's normal and acceptable
[1442.28 → 1445.30] using all sorts of new categories to describe our sexual freedom
[1445.30 → 1447.58] and it's going to lead to a lot more slavery
[1447.58 → 1451.56] right even this month I saw two articles not one but two
[1451.56 → 1456.78] celebrating polyamory and if you don't know polyamory is that's basically saying you're in a marriage covenant
[1456.78 → 1459.20] but you can sleep with anyone while you're in the marriage covenant
[1459.20 → 1463.46] and I just think okay there's a new area where people are sort of exploring and try to deconstruct
[1463.46 → 1469.02] this notion of covenant marriage and open doors to more quote-unquote liberation within that marriage bond
[1469.02 → 1472.04] but it will give us
[1472.04 → 1473.98] a huge opportunity
[1473.98 → 1475.96] to proclaim Jesus Christ
[1475.96 → 1481.00] because what I am so convinced of and I hope you are too is that there is freedom found in only one person
[1481.00 → 1487.30] all the time in every culture and that is Jesus Christ and it is Jesus Christ who has come to set us free
[1487.30 → 1493.56] from the idols that enslave us and that includes in Canada the slavery we have to the idol of sex
[1493.56 → 1498.66] and church I want to say this to you like if you are seeking to follow Jesus
[1498.66 → 1500.80] he's coming for you
[1500.80 → 1502.84] in every area of life
[1502.84 → 1504.24] to give you freedom
[1504.24 → 1509.64] he's coming for your finances he's coming for your time he's coming for your sabbath he's coming for all the dimensions
[1509.64 → 1512.04] and he's coming for your sexual freedom as well
[1512.04 → 1517.36] don't be surprised if god brings into your life people who are willing to talk to you about it
[1517.36 → 1520.64] or ask you questions about it so that you can experience healing and renewal
[1520.64 → 1524.14] don't be surprised when circumstances allow new opportunities
[1524.14 → 1526.54] for you to confess and repent and experience
[1526.54 → 1529.26] liberation because that's what Jesus is on about
[1529.26 → 1532.02] and let me speak now very personally from my own experience
[1532.02 → 1539.22] I have learned as I deal with my own sexual brokenness and most of us haven't okay not just me
[1539.22 → 1542.66] that Jesus Christ is so kind
[1542.66 → 1545.42] he is so patient
[1545.42 → 1548.38] and he is so full of mercy
[1548.38 → 1554.50] we often think when we imagine the worst stuff we've done or the things that we are so ashamed of and never spoken out loud
[1554.50 → 1559.22] we imagine Jesus just ready to pounce on judgment when Jesus invites us into freedom
[1559.22 → 1563.54] he invites us into an embrace that leads to life
[1563.54 → 1564.94] he is so kind
[1564.94 → 1566.86] he is so merciful
[1566.86 → 1568.94] he is so full of compassion
[1568.94 → 1572.72] and to those of you who have maybe never talked to anyone about the brokenness you face
[1572.72 → 1573.40] the shame you face
[1573.40 → 1574.84] it's time to find that person
[1574.84 → 1577.76] and experience the invitation from Jesus himself
[1577.76 → 1581.16] to be set free in the areas of sexuality
[1581.16 → 1587.04] maybe my favourite part of this passage, although it's hard to pick
[1587.04 → 1591.84] is how Paul's speaking to a very sexually broken community in Corinth right
[1591.84 → 1593.54] they've got lots of stuff going on
[1593.54 → 1596.32] like imagine having to deal with incest in your church
[1596.32 → 1597.62] Paul's dealing with that in Corinth
[1597.62 → 1599.76] and still Paul says to this church
[1599.76 → 1601.64] with all their mess going on
[1601.64 → 1603.82] he says you were
[1603.82 → 1605.70] bought at a price
[1605.70 → 1606.64] did you hear that
[1606.64 → 1608.72] you were bought at a price
[1608.72 → 1611.14] that is the finished work of Jesus is behind us
[1611.14 → 1613.94] and it means you now have been rescued by the work of the cross
[1613.94 → 1616.08] secondly he says you are
[1616.08 → 1618.44] temples of the Holy Spirit
[1618.44 → 1621.32] so this broken sexually confused
[1621.32 → 1623.72] called this community in the Corinthian church
[1623.72 → 1624.20] culture
[1624.20 → 1625.34] Paul says
[1625.34 → 1626.78] you've been bought with a price
[1626.78 → 1628.96] the work of Jesus is for you
[1628.96 → 1631.14] the spirit dwells in the midst of you
[1631.14 → 1631.86] and therefore
[1631.86 → 1634.20] you can be free church
[1634.20 → 1636.06] and if it's true for them
[1636.06 → 1637.08] it's true for us
[1637.08 → 1637.80] amen
[1637.80 → 1640.46] if sexual liberation is true for Corinth
[1640.46 → 1641.32] it's true for surrey
[1641.32 → 1642.90] let's take hold of that
[1642.90 → 1645.22] and maybe if you're a note taker
[1645.22 → 1646.46] this is the note to write down
[1646.46 → 1646.84] and memorize
[1646.84 → 1647.56] and come back to
[1647.56 → 1648.94] as you face your own brokenness
[1648.94 → 1649.48] here it is
[1649.48 → 1651.20] because the cross is empty
[1651.20 → 1652.68] and the grave is empty
[1652.68 → 1653.82] we are free
[1653.82 → 1654.86] to flee
[1654.86 → 1656.38] from sexual immorality
[1656.38 → 1657.98] I'll say it again
[1657.98 → 1659.82] because the cross is empty
[1659.82 → 1661.30] you and I are free
[1661.30 → 1662.22] to flee
[1662.22 → 1663.70] from sexual immorality
[1663.70 → 1664.74] there's a new power
[1664.74 → 1665.90] that controls our life
[1665.90 → 1668.00] William Barclay
[1668.00 → 1669.24] a commentator in Corinthians
[1669.24 → 1669.92] writes it this way
[1669.92 → 1672.04] and this just resonates in my bones
[1672.04 → 1673.38] I hope it's good news to you too
[1673.38 → 1674.36] he writes
[1674.36 → 1677.04] Paul's insistence
[1677.04 → 1679.44] that though he is free to do anything
[1679.44 → 1680.36] I hope it's on the screen
[1680.36 → 1683.70] he will not let anything take control of him
[1683.70 → 1685.96] the great fact of the Christian faith
[1685.96 → 1687.88] is not that it makes us free to sin
[1687.88 → 1688.40] hear this
[1688.40 → 1690.02] but that it makes us free
[1690.02 → 1691.94] to not sin
[1691.94 → 1694.52] it is so easy to allow habits
[1694.52 → 1695.42] to take control of us
[1695.42 → 1696.36] but the Christian strength
[1696.36 → 1697.06] that is Jesus
[1697.06 → 1698.22] and his resurrection power
[1698.22 → 1700.74] enables us to take control of them
[1700.74 → 1702.40] when we really experience
[1702.40 → 1703.40] the Christian power
[1703.40 → 1705.12] we are no longer slaves to our bodies
[1705.12 → 1707.02] but take full control of them
[1707.02 → 1707.84] praise the lord
[1707.84 → 1709.32] that's what Jesus wants to do in your life
[1709.32 → 1712.22] and as you open your heart
[1712.22 → 1712.92] and your life
[1712.92 → 1714.20] and you submit to him
[1714.20 → 1715.30] he will come in
[1715.30 → 1716.28] gently tenderly
[1716.28 → 1717.32] and powerfully
[1717.32 → 1718.82] renew you from the inside out
[1718.82 → 1719.84] in every area of life
[1719.84 → 1721.12] including your sexuality
[1721.12 → 1725.94] I'm convinced that one of the ways
[1725.94 → 1727.02] that we as a church
[1727.02 → 1728.28] will be good news to our city
[1728.28 → 1730.58] is in the area of our sexual healing
[1730.58 → 1732.94] in fact nancy Pierce
[1732.94 → 1734.78] who wrote a stunner of a book
[1734.78 → 1735.88] called love thy body
[1735.88 → 1737.44] this is what she writes
[1737.44 → 1738.78] I'm inviting you to ask
[1738.78 → 1739.72] if you really believe this
[1739.72 → 1740.20] she writes
[1740.20 → 1742.66] what Christians do with their sexuality
[1742.66 → 1746.44] is one of the most important testimonies
[1746.44 → 1747.92] they give to the surrounding world
[1747.92 → 1749.02] do you believe that
[1749.02 → 1751.16] it's not just a private deal
[1751.16 → 1753.76] Christianity as we live out our sexual lives
[1753.76 → 1754.38] and our marriages
[1754.38 → 1754.96] and our singleness
[1754.96 → 1755.72] and all the rest
[1755.72 → 1757.00] we are on display
[1757.00 → 1757.98] for a watching world
[1757.98 → 1758.78] for a different way
[1758.78 → 1759.74] and a different story
[1759.74 → 1760.54] for our sexuality
[1760.54 → 1763.02] and as Jonathan touched on last week
[1763.02 → 1763.84] very movingly
[1763.84 → 1764.58] at the end of his sermon
[1764.58 → 1765.86] he said you could trace
[1765.86 → 1767.08] the movement of the church
[1767.08 → 1769.18] by the way the church of Jesus Christ
[1769.18 → 1770.96] pushed back against the idolatry
[1770.96 → 1771.60] of sexuality
[1771.60 → 1773.24] whether it's the neglect of children
[1773.24 → 1774.26] for born out of wedlock
[1774.26 → 1775.04] or exploitation
[1775.04 → 1775.86] and all the rest
[1775.86 → 1776.88] the church was the place
[1776.88 → 1778.06] where they honoured
[1778.06 → 1779.36] god's design for marriage
[1779.36 → 1780.04] and sexuality
[1780.04 → 1781.14] and it would lead to
[1781.14 → 1781.78] sorry
[1781.78 → 1783.48] led to blessing in the city
[1783.48 → 1786.22] may that be true of our city
[1786.22 → 1789.48] one of the earliest criticisms
[1789.48 → 1790.64] I've ever read of the church
[1790.64 → 1791.84] it comes from what's called
[1791.84 → 1793.12] the epistle of igneous
[1793.12 → 1794.18] in 300 a.d
[1794.18 → 1795.06] and I'll read it for you
[1795.06 → 1796.32] I think this is such a singer
[1796.32 → 1797.76] it's like a compliment in disguise
[1797.76 → 1799.50] this is what uh
[1799.50 → 1800.80] this epistle says
[1800.80 → 1801.88] talking about Christians
[1801.88 → 1802.16] it says
[1802.16 → 1803.24] they marry
[1803.24 → 1805.08] as do all others
[1805.08 → 1806.28] those Christians
[1806.28 → 1807.08] they beget children
[1807.08 → 1808.12] but they do not destroy
[1808.12 → 1808.66] their offspring
[1808.66 → 1809.98] and here's the line I love
[1809.98 → 1811.34] they have a common table
[1811.34 → 1812.92] but not a common bed
[1812.92 → 1815.30] they are hospitable
[1815.30 → 1816.36] they break bread with you
[1816.36 → 1817.00] they invite people
[1817.00 → 1817.66] into their homes
[1817.66 → 1818.60] but they honour
[1818.60 → 1819.46] what god's design
[1819.46 → 1820.48] for marriage is
[1820.48 → 1822.74] let's be that church
[1822.74 → 1826.04] I want to finish
[1826.04 → 1827.78] by sharing as a prayer
[1827.78 → 1829.20] something that
[1829.20 → 1830.30] Mary lee Bauma shared
[1830.30 → 1831.40] at and all life interview
[1831.40 → 1832.14] a few months ago
[1832.14 → 1833.18] maybe you were there
[1833.18 → 1833.82] maybe you weren't
[1833.82 → 1834.44] a few months ago
[1834.44 → 1835.80] we invited a pastor
[1835.80 → 1836.56] colleague of mine
[1836.56 → 1837.34] her name is Mary lee
[1837.34 → 1839.14] she would describe herself
[1839.14 → 1840.24] as same sex attracted
[1840.24 → 1841.22] as gay
[1841.22 → 1842.44] and she believed
[1842.44 → 1843.22] that god's call
[1843.22 → 1843.70] on her life
[1843.70 → 1844.50] was to be celibate
[1844.50 → 1845.34] to not exercise
[1845.34 → 1846.16] her desire
[1846.16 → 1847.14] or act on her desires
[1847.14 → 1848.50] and she led a conversation
[1848.50 → 1848.92] with us
[1848.92 → 1850.46] a very lively conversation
[1850.46 → 1851.18] about sexuality
[1851.18 → 1851.76] and the bible
[1851.76 → 1852.70] and how we live it out
[1852.70 → 1854.16] in North American society
[1854.16 → 1855.52] but she shared two things
[1855.52 → 1856.24] that have become a prayer
[1856.24 → 1856.64] for me
[1856.64 → 1857.50] so simple
[1857.50 → 1858.96] her hope
[1858.96 → 1859.66] and my prayer
[1859.66 → 1860.24] for the church
[1860.24 → 1860.92] is that the church
[1860.92 → 1861.82] of Jesus Christ
[1861.82 → 1862.64] this church
[1862.64 → 1864.22] becomes full
[1864.22 → 1865.08] of grace
[1865.08 → 1867.24] and full
[1867.24 → 1868.08] of truth
[1868.08 → 1871.06] not 50-50
[1871.06 → 1872.06] not 60-40
[1872.06 → 1873.18] but full
[1873.18 → 1874.32] of both
[1874.32 → 1875.84] and it's a lament
[1875.84 → 1876.24] of mine
[1876.24 → 1876.98] and maybe yours too
[1876.98 → 1877.70] that so many churches
[1877.70 → 1878.52] can be full of grace
[1878.52 → 1879.22] but not truth
[1879.22 → 1879.96] or full of truth
[1879.96 → 1880.82] but not grace
[1880.82 → 1881.80] and I want hope
[1881.80 → 1882.88] to be full of grace
[1882.88 → 1883.94] and full of truth
[1883.94 → 1885.34] I think it's fair to say
[1885.34 → 1885.96] that most people
[1885.96 → 1886.62] don't talk about
[1886.62 → 1887.50] their sexual brokenness
[1887.50 → 1887.98] in the church
[1887.98 → 1889.18] because they are so afraid
[1889.18 → 1889.90] of being judged
[1889.90 → 1891.36] tell me I'm wrong
[1891.36 → 1892.86] they're so afraid
[1892.86 → 1893.34] that the pastor
[1893.34 → 1893.84] will think they're
[1893.84 → 1894.68] terrible people
[1894.68 → 1895.72] or that they're not welcome
[1895.72 → 1896.86] or that their sin is too great
[1896.86 → 1897.86] it's worse than all the rest
[1897.86 → 1899.46] the church has a terrible history
[1899.46 → 1901.60] of not treating people
[1901.60 → 1902.58] as human beings
[1902.58 → 1904.16] not treating sexual sin
[1904.16 → 1905.00] just like they treat
[1905.00 → 1906.52] all other sexual sin
[1906.52 → 1908.34] may it be said of hope
[1908.34 → 1909.38] that we are a community
[1909.38 → 1910.28] that's full
[1910.28 → 1912.06] of grace
[1912.06 → 1913.84] that there's no sin
[1913.84 → 1914.32] too great
[1914.32 → 1914.80] for Jesus
[1914.80 → 1915.86] great work of redemption
[1915.86 → 1917.06] there's nothing
[1917.06 → 1917.46] that makes you
[1917.46 → 1918.28] too far gone
[1918.28 → 1919.16] for the mercy
[1919.16 → 1919.88] and generosity
[1919.88 → 1920.66] of Jesus Christ
[1920.66 → 1921.20] by the cross
[1921.20 → 1922.16] that there's no one
[1922.16 → 1922.84] who will judge you
[1922.84 → 1923.42] in the church
[1923.42 → 1924.52] because this is what
[1924.52 → 1925.14] you struggle with
[1925.14 → 1926.56] as if you're the only one
[1926.56 → 1928.30] let's be that church
[1928.30 → 1929.10] that is full of grace
[1929.10 → 1929.84] and can I say it again
[1929.84 → 1931.08] find that person you know
[1931.08 → 1932.26] who you trust
[1932.26 → 1933.58] and allow them
[1933.58 → 1934.26] into the journey
[1934.26 → 1936.02] allow them to be
[1936.02 → 1936.80] speaking truth
[1936.80 → 1937.64] praying truth
[1937.64 → 1938.58] and journeying with you
[1938.58 → 1939.50] into your wholeness
[1939.50 → 1940.78] that Jesus invites you
[1940.78 → 1941.72] and i into together
[1941.72 → 1944.46] but that is deeply tied
[1944.46 → 1945.52] to being a church
[1945.52 → 1947.30] that is full of truth
[1947.30 → 1949.26] I think a lament of mine
[1949.26 → 1951.22] is that in all the conversation
[1951.22 → 1951.82] that's happening
[1951.82 → 1952.58] at the church level
[1952.58 → 1953.06] and this is like
[1953.06 → 1953.84] every denomination
[1953.84 → 1954.62] around sexuality
[1954.62 → 1956.04] a lot of people
[1956.04 → 1956.70] are neglecting
[1956.70 → 1957.74] to read the bible itself
[1957.74 → 1959.18] and if I had more time
[1959.18 → 1959.84] I'd just share with you
[1959.84 → 1960.92] how a big part of my journey
[1960.92 → 1962.60] in understanding sexuality
[1962.60 → 1963.72] is really having to do
[1963.72 → 1964.56] the hard work
[1964.56 → 1965.66] of reading all the passages
[1965.66 → 1966.18] in the bible
[1966.18 → 1967.42] around sexuality
[1967.42 → 1968.74] all the passages
[1968.74 → 1969.58] I don't necessarily
[1969.58 → 1970.48] feel comfortable with
[1970.48 → 1971.18] and allow the bible
[1971.18 → 1972.10] to challenge me
[1972.10 → 1973.08] who grew up
[1973.08 → 1974.08] and continues to live
[1974.08 → 1975.22] in an over-sex society
[1975.22 → 1976.64] and allow myself to say
[1976.64 → 1978.06] lord this feels strange
[1978.06 → 1978.30] to me
[1978.30 → 1978.90] it feels hard to me
[1978.90 → 1979.72] but I believe it's good news
[1979.72 → 1980.58] because it's your word
[1980.58 → 1982.38] let's be people
[1982.38 → 1982.94] who don't just read
[1982.94 → 1983.68] blog articles
[1983.68 → 1984.60] but read the scripture
[1984.60 → 1985.44] and allow the scripture
[1985.44 → 1986.52] to be our guide
[1986.52 → 1987.42] our teacher
[1987.42 → 1989.10] and the thing that guides us
[1989.10 → 1990.04] into freedom
[1990.04 → 1991.48] in Jesus
[1991.48 → 1993.52] because as we do that
[1993.52 → 1994.40] live full of grace
[1994.40 → 1995.10] and full of truth
[1995.10 → 1997.54] then we will shine brightly
[1997.54 → 1999.58] in the sexual slavery
[1999.58 → 2000.28] of our culture
[2000.28 → 2001.66] amen
[2001.66 → 2003.56] let me lead us
[2003.56 → 2003.98] in prayer
[2003.98 → 2012.94] lord as i
[2012.94 → 2013.82] lead this prayer
[2013.82 → 2014.58] I feel the weight
[2014.58 → 2015.68] of this teaching myself
[2015.68 → 2018.34] and I want to thank you
[2018.34 → 2019.10] for your word
[2019.10 → 2021.12] and I want to thank you
[2021.12 → 2021.82] that the bodies
[2021.82 → 2022.86] we live in
[2022.86 → 2024.32] are good
[2024.32 → 2026.22] I praise you
[2026.22 → 2027.38] for the goodness
[2027.38 → 2027.96] of the bodies
[2027.96 → 2028.56] we have
[2028.56 → 2030.06] and I ask that you
[2030.06 → 2030.66] would give us hearts
[2030.66 → 2031.60] to receive our bodies
[2031.60 → 2032.22] with gratitude
[2032.22 → 2035.18] and as we think about
[2035.18 → 2035.68] our bodies
[2035.68 → 2036.46] and our sexuality
[2036.46 → 2037.82] lord I ask that you
[2037.82 → 2038.54] bring healing
[2038.54 → 2040.06] to wherever there is shame
[2040.06 → 2041.92] wherever there is
[2041.92 → 2042.70] brokenness
[2042.70 → 2044.54] wherever there is fear
[2044.54 → 2045.62] and guilt
[2045.62 → 2047.92] and I ask that your spirit
[2047.92 → 2049.36] do a new work in us
[2049.36 → 2050.02] of healing
[2050.02 → 2050.90] and renewal
[2050.90 → 2052.44] that you would draw us
[2052.44 → 2053.02] out of darkness
[2053.02 → 2053.62] into light
[2053.62 → 2054.48] out of slavery
[2054.48 → 2056.10] into true freedom
[2056.10 → 2057.50] through your son Jesus
[2057.50 → 2059.60] I pray that if we have
[2059.60 → 2061.02] a hard time believing this
[2061.02 → 2061.82] that we'd receive it
[2061.82 → 2062.32] this morning
[2062.32 → 2063.86] that we are truly
[2063.86 → 2065.64] temples of the Holy Spirit
[2065.64 → 2067.32] and Jesus you dwell
[2067.32 → 2068.24] in us
[2068.24 → 2070.90] we trust you
[2070.90 → 2071.56] with our futures
[2071.56 → 2073.08] and we ask that you
[2073.08 → 2073.84] would give us hearts
[2073.84 → 2074.98] that submit to the goodness
[2074.98 → 2076.38] of your design
[2076.38 → 2077.60] it is in the name
[2077.60 → 2078.42] of your son Jesus
[2078.42 → 2078.96] we pray
[2078.96 → 2079.66] amen
[2079.66 → 2093.22] and again
