[0.00 → 14.32] Good morning. It is good to be together again and to celebrate community and our common vision
[14.32 → 22.80] as a church. This morning we're going to continue looking at some of the words that Jesus spoke that
[22.80 → 29.60] are harder to deal with. We call this series Hard Sayings of Jesus. And today's passage
[30.48 → 36.16] certainly caused me to do some hard thinking and praying. And so, let's just get right into it. So,
[36.16 → 39.84] look at the passage with me. It will be up on the screen here. If you have your Bibles,
[39.84 → 45.12] you can open them up to Luke 12. We're going to read verses 49 through 56.
[45.12 → 54.40] Here's what the Word says, Jesus speaking, I have come to bring fire on earth and how I wish it were
[54.40 → 61.84] already kindled. But I have a baptism to undergo and what constraint I am under until it is completed.
[63.04 → 70.56] Do you think that I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. From now on,
[70.56 → 75.20] there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two, two against three.
[75.20 → 79.76] There will be divided father against son, son against father, mother against daughter,
[80.32 → 84.56] daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.
[84.56 → 89.60] And he said to the crowd, when you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say,
[89.60 → 95.28] it's going to rain. And it does. And when the south wind blows, you say, it's going to be hot.
[95.28 → 103.28] And it is. Hypocrites. You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it
[103.28 → 110.56] you don't know how to interpret this present time? Well, there you go. That's pretty straightforward.
[111.12 → 117.52] Let's conclude with the last song and go home. That's kind of almost how I feel, or at least how
[117.52 → 123.12] I felt when I first read the passage. I kind of go, oh man, there's a lot there. Jesus saying,
[123.12 → 131.36] I came to bring fire. I came to bring division. Like, what's going on here? This is kind of messing
[131.36 → 139.92] with our popular image of Jesus, right? A Jesus that anyone could like, soothing, peaceful,
[140.72 → 146.00] saying things that we want to hear, strolling through the meadow with a lamb across his shoulders,
[146.00 → 152.88] soft, cuddly Jesus, non-offensive. And I've heard people say, you know, I like Jesus, not the church too
[152.88 → 159.12] much. But I like Jesus. And Jesus is seen more like a life coach dispensing good advice and how to live a
[159.12 → 170.64] successful life. A Jesus who makes no real demands on us. And I want to tell you, that Jesus doesn't exist.
[172.08 → 177.20] He does give good advice. He does talk about how to live life. But there's so much more going on than
[177.20 → 185.52] that. And we hear Him in today's passage, I came to bring fire. I came to bring division. What does He
[185.52 → 193.60] mean? In Scripture, fire is often connected with judgment, sometimes with purification. But let's be
[193.60 → 201.36] really clear here. Jesus came to bring salvation for all people. That's why John 3, famous verse 16,
[201.36 → 206.32] God so loved the world, He gave His only Son that whoever believes in Him will be saved.
[208.08 → 213.04] That's just a straightforward gospel. Elsewhere in Scripture, it says God didn't send His Son
[213.04 → 219.84] into the world to condemn the world, right? That wasn't the point. The point was salvation.
[220.64 → 226.96] Love warns. Love invites. Love seeks truth.
[226.96 → 238.40] God's invitation to be saved and transformed and healed.
[240.64 → 249.44] John 11, verse 11, 12, I look at this with me. This is about Jesus. He came to that which was His own,
[249.44 → 258.24] His own people. But His own did not receive Him. Yet all who did receive Him, to those who believed in
[258.24 → 267.04] His name, He gave the right to become children of God. That is Jesus' desire that we all become children
[267.76 → 274.96] of God. Scripture says, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[274.96 → 284.88] God's not leaving anyone out. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. In other words, all need saving, all need transforming, all need redeeming.
[286.16 → 299.84] Israel had been waiting for a Messiah who would solve, really, their political problems, who would restore Israel to its rightful place. That's the Messiah they were waiting for.
[299.84 → 307.54] They, as individuals, weren't really thinking about their need for being saved. Their hearts didn't seem to need transforming.
[309.20 → 313.10] And so, when we think about this, we say, so did Jesus come to bring peace or division?
[314.20 → 318.06] Well, you know, when we read Luke 2, we go back to the Christmas story, the angel singing,
[318.22 → 323.76] Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to those on whom His favour rests.
[323.76 → 329.14] Paul writes in Philippians 4, though, he pushes that peace idea a little further here.
[329.68 → 335.62] He writes, don't be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, we've been talking about this morning,
[335.92 → 339.10] with thanksgiving, present your request to God, and here we go.
[339.50 → 342.40] And the peace of God, what kind of peace?
[343.06 → 351.18] Which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[351.18 → 355.50] Jesus is the way to peace.
[357.02 → 359.70] Peace between you and God.
[360.14 → 360.78] Us and God.
[361.44 → 362.36] You have sinned.
[362.42 → 363.06] I have sinned.
[363.14 → 363.86] We have sinned.
[364.38 → 368.74] And that has put a dividing wall between a holy God and people.
[369.40 → 370.82] That's the story of Scripture.
[371.78 → 375.02] And Jesus is the way of bridging that divide.
[375.34 → 379.20] But ironically, in that, division will happen.
[379.20 → 383.68] Even in families, as Jesus points out in the passage we read.
[385.08 → 389.04] In 1 Corinthians, we read this, 1 Corinthians 23.
[390.20 → 391.86] Paul writes, and he writes,
[392.14 → 400.84] But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles.
[400.84 → 404.00] A stumbling block.
[405.56 → 411.86] Yeah, putting Jesus and bringing his peace into your life, it demands something.
[411.92 → 412.54] What does it demand?
[412.72 → 419.48] It demands your surrender to your agenda and embracing God's agenda for your life.
[420.92 → 424.72] Israel couldn't accept Jesus' way as the way to peace with God.
[425.04 → 425.78] Rome couldn't.
[426.02 → 427.06] Greece couldn't.
[427.30 → 428.84] The religious leaders couldn't.
[428.84 → 430.40] Many today can't either.
[431.12 → 434.94] In my interactions with people in my life, I've heard people say,
[435.30 → 438.90] So you're saying I'm a sinner in need of saving?
[440.38 → 440.82] Hmm.
[440.96 → 441.70] I don't think so.
[443.30 → 444.22] Or they might say,
[444.40 → 445.76] Well, who are you to judge?
[445.82 → 447.72] For that matter, who's God to judge?
[449.22 → 450.08] Yet Jesus says,
[450.18 → 450.92] I am the way.
[451.06 → 451.86] I am the truth.
[452.02 → 452.68] I am life.
[452.68 → 455.48] No one comes to the Father except through me.
[458.46 → 462.58] In John 12, verse 46, Jesus says it this way.
[462.92 → 468.80] I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.
[469.04 → 473.46] The flip side of that is, you don't believe in him, you stay in darkness.
[473.46 → 477.38] But you don't think you're in darkness.
[479.24 → 482.22] I was reading the story of Jesus' triumphal entry in Luke.
[483.26 → 485.54] He's entering Jerusalem to go face the cross.
[486.38 → 491.66] And people are thrilled because they think he's come to start a revolution against the Romans.
[491.88 → 493.10] And so they're quite thrilled.
[493.46 → 497.48] But notice, here's what Jesus says in Luke 19 as he's approaching Jerusalem.
[497.48 → 502.36] As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it.
[503.40 → 504.42] He's riding in.
[504.48 → 505.08] He's coming in.
[505.46 → 506.40] He sees Jerusalem.
[506.92 → 507.98] He weeps over it.
[508.00 → 508.38] And he said,
[508.68 → 515.56] If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace,
[517.92 → 520.12] that peace that's beyond understanding,
[520.40 → 522.94] that peace that only comes through the cross, right?
[523.28 → 525.86] But now it is hidden from your eyes.
[527.48 → 530.72] You know, sometimes, I don't know about you,
[530.80 → 533.96] but sometimes I think we struggle with the judgment of God.
[535.58 → 537.28] We don't even like the word very much.
[538.40 → 539.32] Let me ask you this.
[539.76 → 545.40] Would you want a God who ignores evil and brokenness and lies and sin?
[547.54 → 549.32] Would you want to follow a God like that?
[552.02 → 552.72] I wouldn't.
[552.72 → 556.78] I would want my God to be better than that.
[558.90 → 559.04] Right?
[560.08 → 562.00] You know, I've heard people say,
[562.08 → 562.80] I can't go to church.
[562.92 → 564.42] They're so judgmental in the church.
[564.80 → 566.30] And that's sometimes true,
[566.62 → 571.20] but mostly because it's done sometimes so unmovingly and so self-righteously.
[571.46 → 572.60] That's the problem.
[572.96 → 575.58] Sometimes the word spoken itself are not the problem.
[575.58 → 578.74] How many of you parents say no to your kids?
[581.94 → 583.40] Some kids are looking at their parents and say,
[583.52 → 584.30] yeah, all the time.
[585.58 → 587.88] How many of you correct them when they choose poorly
[587.88 → 590.06] or even sometimes punish them when they choose poorly?
[590.44 → 591.82] Why do you do that, right?
[591.96 → 593.32] Because you love them.
[593.80 → 596.76] Love seeks the truth, holds on to the truth,
[597.08 → 598.46] lives out of truth.
[598.46 → 601.60] We want that for the people we love.
[603.48 → 605.04] You know, in all of this judgment thinking,
[605.16 → 606.38] I was thinking of the courts.
[607.74 → 609.16] You have ever been to court?
[609.38 → 610.14] Don't raise your hand.
[612.28 → 612.68] Right?
[612.80 → 612.94] Yeah.
[613.08 → 618.28] I had to testify once in a court case in Surrey.
[619.88 → 621.16] I remember sitting there, you know,
[621.16 → 624.86] you're in this little seated area here,
[625.10 → 626.74] and in walks the judge,
[626.82 → 627.70] and everybody rises.
[628.46 → 629.90] You know, it's very formal.
[630.76 → 632.86] Guy's wearing a black robe, looks very stern.
[633.66 → 635.74] But imagine if I had stood up and said,
[636.14 → 638.18] this place is so judgmental,
[638.24 → 639.96] especially the guy in the black robe.
[642.06 → 642.36] Right?
[642.42 → 644.96] Yeah, that wouldn't go over while I'd be in trouble.
[645.88 → 648.32] But we wouldn't do that because that's stupid.
[648.98 → 649.18] Right?
[649.18 → 654.52] We all know we need places where wrong is judged
[654.52 → 657.88] by someone who's put some thought into it according to law.
[657.88 → 659.68] We all know that.
[659.68 → 661.30] We're happy for that.
[661.30 → 664.02] That evil behaviour is punished,
[664.36 → 668.54] and hopefully the one who did the evil is somehow rehabilitated,
[668.80 → 670.68] and we want all that to happen.
[670.68 → 673.66] But that only happens with judgment.
[673.66 → 681.48] As Christians, we are called to speak the truth in love.
[682.28 → 684.06] Emphasis on the word in love.
[684.94 → 690.00] Not to win an argument, which often is not motivated by love.
[690.00 → 692.66] So that we might bless others.
[693.00 → 696.26] Jesus confronted especially the religious leaders of his day
[696.26 → 699.92] because they misled people, and they were self-righteous.
[700.22 → 702.02] And he speaks truth to them.
[702.42 → 704.78] You vipers, you whitewashed grays.
[705.14 → 705.42] Why?
[705.64 → 707.38] Because he loves truth.
[707.92 → 709.26] He points out truth.
[709.62 → 710.42] God's truth.
[710.62 → 711.28] God's ways.
[711.56 → 712.72] And he loves people.
[712.72 → 714.20] And he's saying to the leaders,
[714.56 → 716.32] don't mess this up.
[718.00 → 719.12] Don't mess this up.
[719.18 → 721.12] You have a big responsibility with these people.
[721.18 → 721.68] Don't mess it up.
[721.92 → 725.00] He's challenging them for the sake of the people,
[725.14 → 727.08] but also for the sake of the leaders.
[728.86 → 729.06] Right?
[729.10 → 730.46] One of those leaders, Nicodemus.
[731.46 → 732.26] He was a Pharisee.
[732.38 → 735.12] Later on, he became a follower of Jesus, it seems.
[736.46 → 736.68] Right?
[736.68 → 741.32] So Jesus speaks truth in love to transform people
[741.32 → 744.06] and bring them to their need for salvation.
[744.66 → 747.02] The cross, though, is a stumbling block
[747.02 → 749.40] because it speaks the central truth.
[749.94 → 756.88] You need a Saviour every single day of your life.
[762.88 → 764.40] That's a stumbling block for some.
[766.68 → 769.78] Jesus refers to this defining moment
[769.78 → 771.84] in our passage as baptism.
[773.14 → 774.58] You might think, what's that about?
[774.80 → 775.78] What's he mean, baptism?
[776.46 → 778.50] Baptism in its significance,
[779.22 → 780.92] and we see it sometimes when we baptize, right?
[781.18 → 783.32] We saw that a while back here, not so long ago.
[783.52 → 783.68] Right?
[783.74 → 784.52] You go underwater.
[784.88 → 786.08] You die to self.
[786.46 → 787.32] You come up again.
[787.68 → 789.42] You're alive in Christ.
[789.84 → 791.78] That's the picture where Jesus says,
[791.92 → 793.74] you know, my death is a baptism.
[793.74 → 797.70] It's a baptism where out of death comes life,
[798.10 → 799.32] through the cross.
[802.40 → 803.84] Through the cross, through his death.
[805.98 → 808.26] There's a line in verse 52 of our passage
[808.26 → 810.24] that says, from now on.
[810.42 → 812.74] It's a phrase that Jesus uses elsewhere, too.
[812.98 → 814.98] When he calls his disciples, when they're fishing,
[815.44 → 816.14] and he says, you know,
[816.22 → 817.72] I will make you fishers of men.
[817.76 → 819.50] He says, from now on,
[819.58 → 821.18] I will make you fishers of men.
[821.18 → 822.18] Right?
[822.94 → 824.52] When he's going to ascend into heaven,
[824.64 → 826.26] he says, from now on,
[826.60 → 828.68] the Son of Man is seated at the right hand of the Father.
[829.76 → 830.82] From now on.
[830.94 → 832.04] From now on,
[832.10 → 833.56] from the time of Jesus
[833.56 → 836.30] to now and beyond,
[837.22 → 838.24] things are going to be different.
[838.32 → 839.06] The kingdom has come.
[840.58 → 841.68] The kingdom has come.
[843.16 → 844.78] So, yeah, there's going to be divisions.
[846.54 → 848.12] Divisions even in families,
[848.12 → 850.66] because people are going to stumble over this.
[852.08 → 856.04] We don't easily want to surrender to that truth.
[858.82 → 861.24] Maybe you've experienced that in your life,
[861.28 → 861.84] in your family.
[863.70 → 864.72] And Jesus has said,
[864.88 → 865.32] take heart,
[865.66 → 866.76] I have overcome sin and death.
[866.84 → 867.52] That's the good news.
[867.86 → 870.52] I have come to bring life in all its fullness.
[870.68 → 873.40] I have come to bring peace beyond your comprehension.
[873.40 → 875.84] Share that peace,
[876.40 → 878.50] even if it isn't always received.
[880.38 → 883.54] Peace is generally seen as a good thing.
[884.18 → 884.34] Right?
[885.06 → 887.18] When we hear the angel saying,
[887.52 → 888.66] peace on earth,
[888.78 → 889.32] good will to man,
[889.40 → 890.00] we say, yeah,
[890.14 → 890.88] everybody agreed.
[890.98 → 892.30] Yay, yay, peace.
[892.94 → 893.78] Merry Christmas.
[894.86 → 895.20] And then we say,
[895.26 → 896.74] well, that peace comes through the cross.
[896.84 → 898.56] Well, wait a minute, Bible thumped.
[898.56 → 901.92] Slow down a little bit here.
[901.96 → 902.82] I like the peace part.
[902.90 → 904.30] Let's not drag the cross into this.
[907.68 → 908.08] Peace.
[909.04 → 910.76] End of wars and violence.
[910.82 → 911.32] Of course.
[912.10 → 913.14] That's part of it too.
[914.12 → 914.84] But peace,
[915.38 → 915.92] ultimately,
[916.36 → 918.16] harmony of people
[918.16 → 919.58] with a holy God
[919.58 → 921.82] who has every right to judge them,
[921.96 → 924.10] but doesn't because the Son has come
[924.10 → 928.76] and taken away the price of sin and death from us,
[930.04 → 931.88] from those who will surrender to that.
[932.96 → 935.78] And Jesus longs for that mission to be over, right?
[935.82 → 936.02] He said,
[936.08 → 937.54] I wish that fire was already kindled.
[937.78 → 939.74] He's anxious to complete it
[939.74 → 942.32] where he will face the consequences of sin
[942.32 → 943.38] for you and I,
[944.08 → 944.72] where he will say,
[944.78 → 945.48] my God, my God,
[945.60 → 947.50] why have you forsaken me
[947.50 → 950.50] so you didn't have to be forsaken?
[950.50 → 950.58] Amen.
[950.58 → 950.62] Amen.
[954.10 → 958.20] You know, fire,
[958.96 → 959.72] Jesus talked about fire,
[959.78 → 960.82] fire can destroy, right?
[961.62 → 962.92] But it also purifies.
[964.50 → 965.38] It purifies.
[965.72 → 967.58] We are purified through those fires.
[968.42 → 968.56] Right?
[968.58 → 970.48] We sometimes talk about forest fires, right?
[970.54 → 972.86] And all that underbrush is burned away
[972.86 → 974.30] and it'll seem pretty bad for a while,
[974.34 → 974.68] but, you know,
[974.70 → 976.06] all kinds of new life comes out of that.
[980.56 → 981.98] We find our purification
[981.98 → 983.34] through the fire,
[983.48 → 984.18] Jesus starts
[984.18 → 986.60] with his death and resurrection.
[987.98 → 988.78] And in that,
[988.96 → 990.82] we are at peace with God
[990.82 → 991.76] and, yeah,
[991.82 → 992.76] with one another too.
[993.12 → 995.86] But not everyone will accept that.
[998.04 → 998.94] And maybe you,
[998.94 → 999.62] maybe you,
[999.74 → 1001.40] you feel like you want to settle for a peace
[1001.40 → 1003.10] that's about conflict avoidance.
[1003.16 → 1004.66] That's another kind of peace.
[1005.72 → 1007.60] You have ever been in that kind of situation, right?
[1008.32 → 1009.48] The situation's tense,
[1009.48 → 1010.88] whatever the thing is,
[1011.04 → 1012.08] the issue is,
[1012.60 → 1013.64] and you want to say something,
[1013.76 → 1015.60] but you don't for the sake of peace.
[1016.96 → 1017.32] Really,
[1017.66 → 1018.98] you just don't want to have a big fight
[1018.98 → 1019.72] about something again.
[1020.40 → 1020.52] Right?
[1020.56 → 1021.48] And I kind of get that.
[1021.66 → 1022.12] I get that.
[1022.16 → 1024.08] We can't be fighting all the time.
[1024.90 → 1025.90] Sometimes it is wise
[1025.90 → 1026.86] just to keep your mouth shut.
[1029.18 → 1030.16] But not all the time.
[1032.64 → 1034.34] We can't hide the gospel.
[1034.94 → 1035.14] All the time.
[1035.16 → 1035.66] And I get it.
[1035.66 → 1037.86] We can show the gospel
[1037.86 → 1038.84] through the way we live.
[1038.92 → 1039.72] Of course, right?
[1039.88 → 1041.40] And we can be loving and caring
[1041.40 → 1041.90] and all that.
[1042.16 → 1042.74] That's true.
[1042.92 → 1045.10] But sometimes we say something,
[1045.36 → 1046.54] hopefully in love.
[1049.14 → 1050.08] And I'll be honest with you,
[1050.12 → 1052.58] I don't always know how to navigate this
[1052.58 → 1054.58] in my relationships.
[1057.12 → 1058.52] I tend to say things.
[1060.54 → 1060.78] You know,
[1060.82 → 1062.02] once in a while I'm saying something
[1062.02 → 1063.92] and my wife's sitting close to me
[1063.92 → 1064.70] and I get one of these.
[1065.66 → 1066.22] You know,
[1066.22 → 1066.96] kick in the leg
[1066.96 → 1067.38] and I go,
[1068.50 → 1069.64] no more talking, Sid.
[1071.18 → 1071.96] Settle down.
[1073.80 → 1076.00] And often that's the right thing here
[1076.00 → 1077.38] because sometimes too many words
[1077.38 → 1078.04] are not helpful.
[1079.54 → 1080.00] But yeah,
[1080.06 → 1081.34] I don't always know how to navigate that.
[1081.64 → 1082.86] Maybe you struggle with that too.
[1083.40 → 1084.12] The key though,
[1084.20 → 1085.32] stay loving.
[1085.50 → 1085.62] Yeah,
[1085.66 → 1086.76] don't over talk.
[1087.00 → 1087.78] That can happen too.
[1088.12 → 1088.88] But sometimes,
[1089.06 → 1091.12] sometimes we need to speak the truth
[1091.12 → 1092.22] but make sure it's in love.
[1092.22 → 1092.28] Love.
[1095.66 → 1096.86] You know,
[1096.94 → 1099.30] and I picture Jesus saying what He did.
[1099.42 → 1099.52] You know,
[1099.58 → 1101.30] I've come to bring fire
[1101.30 → 1102.66] and I've come to bring division
[1102.66 → 1103.86] and the crowd's going,
[1104.26 → 1105.24] what?
[1105.24 → 1108.28] And the disciples are sitting there
[1108.28 → 1109.60] and some of them are estranged
[1109.60 → 1110.60] from their families
[1110.60 → 1112.46] because they follow Jesus.
[1113.40 → 1115.14] They're living out the division
[1115.14 → 1116.62] that came with that,
[1117.38 → 1119.88] with their faith in Jesus.
[1121.60 → 1123.54] Earlier on in our hard sayings of Jesus,
[1123.68 → 1124.08] you know,
[1124.34 → 1125.78] we talked about when He said,
[1126.44 → 1126.84] you know,
[1126.88 → 1128.00] you need to eat my body
[1128.00 → 1128.80] and drink my blood
[1128.80 → 1129.46] and the crowd,
[1129.58 → 1129.78] what?
[1129.88 → 1130.56] Walked away.
[1130.56 → 1132.00] What is He talking about here?
[1132.00 → 1133.54] And then Jesus asked the disciples,
[1133.66 → 1135.12] are you guys leaving too?
[1136.10 → 1136.56] And they said,
[1136.60 → 1136.72] well,
[1136.76 → 1137.50] where else do we go?
[1137.58 → 1138.22] You are truth,
[1138.34 → 1138.64] right?
[1140.02 → 1141.28] And it struck me.
[1142.82 → 1144.34] It struck me a while
[1144.34 → 1145.34] when I was thinking about this,
[1146.28 → 1147.40] about folks who had come
[1147.40 → 1147.98] to Hope Community
[1147.98 → 1149.08] over the years.
[1149.64 → 1150.92] And sometimes they came,
[1151.38 → 1152.34] and we were glad they,
[1152.56 → 1153.80] for whatever reason they came,
[1154.10 → 1155.84] but sometimes some of them came
[1155.84 → 1157.72] for the good of their kids.
[1158.86 → 1159.82] Kind of this sentiment.
[1159.82 → 1161.14] It's good for the kids
[1161.14 → 1162.28] to have a little religion.
[1164.52 → 1164.78] You know,
[1165.24 → 1166.38] let them hear a little God talk
[1166.38 → 1166.72] once in a while.
[1166.76 → 1167.12] That's good.
[1168.30 → 1169.06] You don't have to take it
[1169.06 → 1169.62] too seriously,
[1169.76 → 1171.28] but just a little religion.
[1172.88 → 1173.70] And it's interesting,
[1174.02 → 1174.24] you know,
[1174.44 → 1175.00] these kids,
[1175.12 → 1176.54] they just like the programs
[1176.54 → 1177.42] and the fun they had
[1177.42 → 1179.06] in Cornerstone
[1179.06 → 1179.80] and things like that.
[1179.90 → 1180.76] So they were just having fun.
[1181.10 → 1182.46] But eventually they became teenagers,
[1182.78 → 1184.22] and they didn't like waking up
[1184.22 → 1184.84] on Sunday mornings,
[1185.00 → 1185.56] and they said,
[1185.62 → 1185.72] ah,
[1185.72 → 1186.58] we're not going anymore.
[1187.46 → 1188.34] And the parents said,
[1188.40 → 1188.50] well,
[1188.52 → 1189.46] we're not going anymore either.
[1190.20 → 1191.76] We've all had our little religion.
[1194.48 → 1195.76] The problem with the little religion
[1195.76 → 1198.38] is it's not absolute surrender
[1198.38 → 1199.30] to the ways of Jesus.
[1203.22 → 1204.70] And you don't get that peace
[1204.70 → 1205.86] that's beyond understanding.
[1207.94 → 1209.40] Jesus didn't come to bring
[1209.40 → 1210.10] a little religion.
[1210.36 → 1211.34] He came to bring life
[1211.34 → 1212.32] in all its fullness.
[1212.64 → 1214.10] And this demands our all.
[1214.10 → 1216.46] And then we desperately find
[1216.46 → 1218.06] the peace that we so much
[1218.06 → 1219.52] are in need of.
[1221.56 → 1222.94] Jesus said to the people
[1222.94 → 1223.94] at that time,
[1224.00 → 1224.10] He said,
[1224.16 → 1224.80] you guys are pretty good
[1224.80 → 1225.66] at predicting the weather,
[1225.94 → 1227.10] but you completely missed
[1227.10 → 1227.88] the signs of the time.
[1227.94 → 1228.88] What was the sign of the time?
[1229.16 → 1229.86] Jesus Himself.
[1230.12 → 1230.86] There's Jesus.
[1230.98 → 1231.74] Right there.
[1232.64 → 1234.64] The sign of the times.
[1235.34 → 1236.14] The Messiah,
[1236.34 → 1237.64] the one who came to save them.
[1237.64 → 1238.44] And they're,
[1238.58 → 1238.88] you know,
[1239.38 → 1240.06] they're missing Him.
[1242.58 → 1243.26] It made me think,
[1243.36 → 1244.90] you and I can go about our lives
[1244.90 → 1247.10] and pay attention to the weather,
[1247.76 → 1248.66] day-to-day demands,
[1248.88 → 1249.32] sports,
[1249.46 → 1250.08] social media.
[1250.86 → 1251.76] We even go to church
[1251.76 → 1253.08] and completely miss Jesus.
[1253.08 → 1259.54] And somehow then we miss our
[1259.54 → 1260.34] on real life
[1260.34 → 1262.44] and on real peace.
[1264.26 → 1265.56] Everywhere Jesus went,
[1265.68 → 1266.28] people were divided
[1266.28 → 1266.96] because of Him.
[1267.30 → 1267.82] At times,
[1267.88 → 1269.00] they lined the streets
[1269.00 → 1269.84] just to see Him
[1269.84 → 1270.40] and hear Him.
[1270.66 → 1271.32] At other times,
[1271.38 → 1272.20] they were going to throw Him
[1272.20 → 1273.40] literally off a cliff.
[1275.68 → 1277.38] Even members of Jesus' own family
[1277.38 → 1278.26] weren't sure what to do with Him.
[1281.92 → 1282.52] You know.
[1283.42 → 1284.24] Some of them were saying,
[1284.32 → 1285.68] I thought He was going to bring
[1285.68 → 1286.86] peace in Israel.
[1287.58 → 1288.90] Get rid of those Romans.
[1289.90 → 1291.12] That was what a lot of them thought.
[1291.56 → 1291.84] You know what?
[1291.86 → 1292.10] Nowadays,
[1292.24 → 1294.12] I thought He was going to just love me
[1294.12 → 1295.18] without asking me
[1295.18 → 1296.58] to change a thing.
[1299.94 → 1301.14] And Jesus stepped in
[1301.14 → 1302.34] with those comments
[1302.34 → 1302.78] and He said,
[1303.36 → 1303.56] oh,
[1303.86 → 1304.82] so that's peace for you.
[1304.82 → 1306.08] Do you think
[1306.08 → 1307.72] I've come to bring peace?
[1307.84 → 1308.36] Like that?
[1309.20 → 1309.62] No.
[1309.86 → 1311.14] I've come to bring division.
[1311.46 → 1312.64] I've come to bring
[1312.64 → 1313.44] a choice.
[1318.18 → 1319.06] Division between
[1319.06 → 1320.34] light and darkness.
[1320.56 → 1321.04] Here's light.
[1321.16 → 1321.64] Here's darkness.
[1321.88 → 1322.54] Which one do you want?
[1323.12 → 1324.60] Between life and death.
[1324.80 → 1325.56] Which one do you want?
[1328.12 → 1328.62] Peace,
[1328.86 → 1330.42] as Jesus defines it.
[1331.30 → 1332.52] Peace that comes
[1332.52 → 1333.40] from repentance
[1333.40 → 1334.80] and then receiving
[1334.80 → 1335.92] grace and forgiveness.
[1335.92 → 1336.14] this.
[1337.34 → 1338.72] The gospel shows
[1338.72 → 1339.64] that people
[1339.64 → 1340.74] that they can't
[1340.74 → 1341.32] do a thing,
[1341.62 → 1342.00] anything,
[1342.34 → 1342.96] to help out
[1342.96 → 1344.54] God with their salvation.
[1344.76 → 1345.88] It's through grace alone.
[1347.74 → 1348.54] I heard a story
[1348.54 → 1350.22] of an eight-year-old
[1350.22 → 1352.24] asking his mom,
[1352.80 → 1353.14] mom,
[1353.34 → 1354.22] do you love God
[1354.22 → 1355.00] more than me?
[1355.00 → 1358.78] His mom said,
[1359.04 → 1359.24] yeah,
[1359.28 → 1359.48] yeah,
[1359.56 → 1359.76] Ben,
[1359.82 → 1360.38] I do.
[1363.96 → 1364.86] She knew
[1364.86 → 1367.10] that the fullness
[1367.10 → 1368.02] of her life
[1368.02 → 1369.04] and who she was,
[1369.26 → 1370.42] including her motherhood,
[1370.64 → 1371.54] had to find
[1371.54 → 1373.04] its primary identity
[1373.04 → 1373.60] and meaning
[1373.60 → 1374.08] in God
[1374.08 → 1374.90] and not
[1374.90 → 1376.14] in anything else.
[1376.54 → 1377.34] And only then
[1377.34 → 1378.20] would she be able
[1378.20 → 1379.36] to fully love Ben
[1379.36 → 1380.26] and be the mother
[1380.26 → 1381.30] he needed her to be.
[1381.58 → 1382.56] And she said that to him,
[1382.82 → 1384.04] because I love God more,
[1384.26 → 1384.86] I can learn
[1384.86 → 1386.62] to love you more.
[1389.24 → 1390.10] My wife and I
[1390.10 → 1390.66] talked about that
[1390.66 → 1391.32] a long time ago.
[1392.52 → 1392.90] Right?
[1393.12 → 1393.26] Yeah,
[1393.30 → 1394.10] we love each other.
[1394.74 → 1395.44] If you were to ask
[1395.44 → 1396.22] Sid or Candy,
[1397.04 → 1397.98] who do you love more,
[1398.08 → 1399.12] God or your spouse?
[1399.36 → 1400.00] The answer is going
[1400.00 → 1400.36] to be God.
[1402.12 → 1403.24] And the irony is,
[1403.46 → 1403.62] yeah,
[1403.68 → 1404.28] we know that
[1404.28 → 1405.24] because we can't
[1405.24 → 1406.28] be God to each other
[1406.28 → 1407.40] because that's a disaster.
[1408.40 → 1409.90] So we need God
[1409.90 → 1410.96] so that we can learn
[1411.30 → 1413.50] to find the true self
[1413.50 → 1414.48] that God made us to be,
[1414.72 → 1415.70] that we can learn grace,
[1415.78 → 1416.62] we can learn freedom,
[1417.02 → 1418.46] and then we can learn
[1418.46 → 1419.26] to love in a way
[1419.26 → 1420.46] that Jesus would love.
[1426.76 → 1427.94] Only out of love for God
[1427.94 → 1429.30] can I learn to love others.
[1431.22 → 1432.04] And I can learn
[1432.04 → 1432.80] to relate to others
[1432.80 → 1434.26] and I can point out to them
[1434.26 → 1435.80] what peace looks like
[1435.80 → 1437.92] and what forgiveness
[1437.92 → 1438.34] looks like
[1438.34 → 1439.06] and grace looks like.
[1439.06 → 1441.12] Jesus' relationship
[1441.12 → 1441.84] with the Father
[1441.84 → 1442.64] is ultimately
[1442.64 → 1443.52] what determines
[1443.52 → 1444.30] His identity,
[1444.62 → 1445.16] His being,
[1445.24 → 1445.92] and His purpose.
[1446.52 → 1447.18] And then He learned
[1447.18 → 1447.56] to say,
[1447.64 → 1448.30] even when it was hard,
[1448.62 → 1449.36] not my will,
[1449.44 → 1450.36] thy will be done.
[1451.58 → 1452.40] And this doesn't mean
[1452.40 → 1453.46] He was rejecting others,
[1453.74 → 1455.58] but that one relationship
[1455.58 → 1457.28] was above all others.
[1460.28 → 1461.52] That is the choice
[1461.52 → 1463.12] that Jesus sets
[1463.12 → 1464.24] before these people here
[1464.24 → 1465.74] and He sets it for us.
[1465.74 → 1467.90] who or what
[1467.90 → 1469.58] is the determining relationship
[1469.58 → 1471.22] that gives you identity
[1471.22 → 1472.38] and being
[1472.38 → 1473.42] and purpose
[1473.42 → 1474.40] and life?
[1475.44 → 1476.26] Who is it?
[1478.04 → 1479.18] What is your
[1479.18 → 1480.82] defining relationship?
[1483.80 → 1484.90] Some of you might answer,
[1485.02 → 1486.20] maybe it's your kids.
[1487.38 → 1488.22] Maybe it's your spouse.
[1488.44 → 1489.20] Maybe it's your work,
[1489.38 → 1489.78] your country,
[1489.86 → 1490.18] yourself.
[1490.18 → 1491.80] It's a choice
[1491.80 → 1493.40] we constantly need to make
[1493.40 → 1495.20] day after day.
[1495.56 → 1496.04] And in that,
[1496.30 → 1496.76] Jesus says,
[1497.06 → 1497.98] I have come
[1497.98 → 1500.00] to bring that division
[1500.00 → 1500.80] to you.
[1504.80 → 1506.16] To bring the choice
[1506.16 → 1507.18] between light and darkness,
[1507.46 → 1508.44] between life and death,
[1508.66 → 1509.66] between real peace
[1509.66 → 1510.80] and shallow peace.
[1511.64 → 1512.74] To choose the Father
[1512.74 → 1514.00] as our primary relationship
[1514.00 → 1515.20] is the way.
[1515.20 → 1518.66] and that defines
[1518.66 → 1519.36] all else.
[1521.16 → 1521.84] And this division
[1521.84 → 1522.56] offers us
[1522.56 → 1523.80] potential growth
[1523.80 → 1524.20] in life.
[1524.44 → 1524.96] It's interesting to me
[1524.96 → 1525.44] when you think about
[1525.44 → 1526.46] division in science
[1526.46 → 1527.46] at the cellular level,
[1528.16 → 1529.20] when the cells divide,
[1529.30 → 1529.88] we have growth.
[1529.98 → 1531.02] That's what growth is
[1531.02 → 1532.24] through division.
[1532.94 → 1533.62] I think that can be
[1533.62 → 1534.28] true for us too.
[1534.68 → 1535.46] Jesus brings
[1535.46 → 1536.16] a division
[1536.16 → 1537.46] that results in growth
[1537.46 → 1538.58] if we follow Him.
[1538.84 → 1539.56] He calls us
[1539.56 → 1540.38] to pay attention
[1540.38 → 1541.20] to our priorities
[1541.20 → 1544.68] and to ensure
[1544.68 → 1546.32] that we put Christ
[1546.32 → 1548.04] above all else
[1548.04 → 1550.40] because He's the source
[1550.40 → 1551.20] of growth.
[1552.82 → 1554.32] So we can love
[1554.32 → 1555.40] and live life
[1555.40 → 1555.80] through Him
[1555.80 → 1557.10] with Him in charge
[1557.10 → 1558.36] and thus enjoying life
[1558.36 → 1559.04] in all its fullness.
[1560.10 → 1560.74] And in that,
[1560.92 → 1561.34] we love
[1561.34 → 1562.24] and invite others
[1562.24 → 1563.38] to do the same.
[1564.68 → 1565.76] Would you pray with me?
[1569.98 → 1570.76] Father God,
[1570.76 → 1571.72] we thank You
[1571.72 → 1572.66] that You are a God
[1572.66 → 1574.64] who puts clearly
[1574.64 → 1575.44] before us
[1575.44 → 1577.18] light and dark,
[1577.46 → 1578.12] life and death.
[1579.14 → 1579.34] Lord,
[1579.42 → 1580.50] may we have the wisdom
[1580.50 → 1581.46] to surrender
[1581.46 → 1582.70] our agenda
[1582.70 → 1583.36] for Yours.
[1584.40 → 1584.96] May we have
[1584.96 → 1585.84] the wisdom
[1585.84 → 1587.08] and the humility
[1587.08 → 1588.54] to see we need
[1588.54 → 1589.18] a Saviour,
[1590.30 → 1592.30] that You are the one
[1592.30 → 1593.02] who will come
[1593.02 → 1594.82] through Your death
[1594.82 → 1595.54] and resurrection
[1595.54 → 1596.70] to save us
[1596.70 → 1597.60] from the brokenness
[1597.60 → 1598.16] of sin
[1598.16 → 1599.32] and death
[1599.32 → 1600.60] and You will bring us
[1600.60 → 1601.06] into life
[1601.06 → 1601.70] in all its fullness.
[1602.18 → 1602.36] Lord,
[1602.42 → 1603.08] we praise You
[1603.08 → 1603.46] for that.
[1603.52 → 1604.44] We pray that we might
[1604.44 → 1605.08] find ways
[1605.08 → 1606.40] to share that gospel,
[1606.88 → 1608.56] not in intentionally
[1608.56 → 1609.72] confrontational ways,
[1609.94 → 1611.02] not to win an argument,
[1611.36 → 1612.36] but out of love
[1612.36 → 1613.02] for You,
[1613.34 → 1614.22] love for truth,
[1614.72 → 1616.00] and love for one another.
[1617.10 → 1617.56] So Lord,
[1617.64 → 1618.34] give us Your wisdom,
[1618.48 → 1619.26] give us Your strength.
[1619.46 → 1620.02] We pray this
[1620.02 → 1620.90] in the name of Jesus.
[1621.42 → 1621.66] Amen.
[1621.66 → 1621.76] Amen.
[1621.76 → 1627.78] Lord,
[1629.70 → 1629.82] please stand as we sing
[1629.82 → 1629.84] our song of response.
[1630.38 → 1630.66] Amen.
[1630.66 → 1631.04] Amen.
[1631.04 → 1631.20] Amen.
[1631.20 → 1631.58] Amen.
[1631.70 → 1632.32] Amen.
