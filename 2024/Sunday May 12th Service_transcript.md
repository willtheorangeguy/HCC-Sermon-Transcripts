[0.00 --> 6.78]  good morning hope
[6.78 --> 15.30]  if you were with us last week pastor dave mentioned that we are going to start our
[15.30 --> 22.32]  holy spirit sermon series starting on pentecost sunday which is next week and so that's what's
[22.32 --> 27.78]  coming up for us as we get to think and reflect on what it means to be gifted with god's holy spirit
[27.78 --> 33.30]  leading us and guiding us through our lives but before we get there today if you follow the
[33.30 --> 39.10]  christian calendar at all it's actually ascension sunday today and we get to reflect and we have
[39.10 --> 44.96]  the privilege of looking at the significance of jesus ascending to his rightful throne and what
[44.96 --> 53.06]  that means for us today so if you were to map out the ministry of jesus when he came to us god sent
[53.06 --> 61.90]  his one and only son and he was born as a human being born as a servant came in his earthly ministry
[61.90 --> 69.02]  reflected his divine authority in his ministries and what dave called it called sneak previews of
[69.02 --> 74.52]  god's kingdom and what it's supposed to be but then the ironic part the next step was that he was
[74.52 --> 81.58]  betrayed by the ones he came to save died on the cross in a sign as a sign of curse and then rose
[81.58 --> 87.48]  again from the dead defeating the power of sin once and for all and then kind of a twist in the
[87.48 --> 94.44]  narrative if you will he is resurrected and then for 40 days he just hangs out he hangs out with his
[94.44 --> 100.92]  friends his his disciples and followers further equipping them to reflect god's kingdom on earth as it is in
[100.92 --> 108.50]  heaven and after that time jesus decides in his ultimate wisdom that it is now time for jesus to ascend
[108.50 --> 115.38]  to his throne at the right hand of god the father to rule the world with the authority that he is given
[115.38 --> 122.68]  the authority all the authority he has under heaven and earth that he continues to rule and so this is a
[122.68 --> 129.20]  sidebar but when we think of jesus ascending to his throne if you're like me you think oh yeah he went
[129.20 --> 137.02]  to heaven above the clouds somewhere far far away in a way the way it's described in acts it can it can
[137.02 --> 144.12]  seem that way but the reality of it is we don't know exactly where the heavenly realms are but we
[144.12 --> 151.50]  know that god is with us and the good news is that jesus is on his throne he has defeated the power of
[151.50 --> 157.80]  sin and death once and for all and now he sits on his rightful throne and he is with us and guides us
[157.80 --> 167.24]  and equips us to live out this kingdom rule here now in the broken world that we live in and that's what we get to look into
[167.24 --> 175.02]  today that's why it's important for us as christians to know that jesus really did ascend to his rightful place
[175.02 --> 182.44]  and and so continuing this thread of why questions so why is this important for us as christians that
[182.44 --> 189.84]  he's ascended to his throne and then continuing on the flip side of that then why is it that jesus
[189.84 --> 198.60]  didn't stay in his perfected resurrected body not for 40 days but for thousands of years meaning why isn't he
[198.60 --> 205.30]  in person with us right now how come he decided in his wisdom to ascend to his throne he was with his
[205.30 --> 211.54]  disciples for 40 days how come he's not with us in person right now that's kind of sort of what i want
[211.54 --> 218.94]  to witness to from scripture but before we dive in and sort of answer these questions i had to stop and
[218.94 --> 226.22]  reflect myself thinking about this last question why didn't just jesus just stay i had to think now if
[226.22 --> 236.86]  jesus was still really with with me here in person first would i be able to acknowledge jesus as my
[236.86 --> 243.70]  lord and savior this person that is with me or would i doubt just like many of his disciples did
[243.70 --> 251.92]  or even worse would i get tired of this king the truthful king of him asking so much of me in my life
[251.92 --> 257.04]  him knowing what it takes to be to have a flourishing life to reflect god's kingdom life
[257.04 --> 263.38]  on earth would i just get tired of that battling against my old self thinking ah seriously jesus more
[263.38 --> 271.70]  prayer seriously jesus more serving more loving something to think about as we reflect on what
[271.70 --> 277.88]  paul presents us to us to us in ephesians about the significance of jesus ascending to his throne
[277.88 --> 283.94]  and so if you have your bibles with you we turn today to ephesians chapter one we read from verse
[283.94 --> 291.04]  three to 14 it's a bit of a longer passage but i will explain why it has to be read together in just a
[291.04 --> 299.52]  sec and so ephesians we read from god's word praise be to god to the god and father of our lord jesus christ
[299.52 --> 307.62]  who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in christ for he chose us in him
[307.62 --> 313.86]  before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight in love he predestined us
[313.86 --> 319.44]  for adoption to sonship through jesus christ in accordance with his pleasure and will to the praise
[319.44 --> 326.34]  of his glorious grace which he has freely given us in the one he loves in him in christ we have
[326.34 --> 331.28]  redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins in accordance with the riches of god's grace
[331.28 --> 337.44]  that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding he made known to us the mystery
[337.44 --> 344.02]  of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in christ to be put into effect when the
[344.02 --> 350.38]  times reach their fulfillment to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under christ
[350.38 --> 357.34]  in him we were also chosen having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out
[357.34 --> 363.46]  everything in conformity with the purpose of his will in order that we who were the first to put
[363.46 --> 370.70]  our hope in christ might be for the praise of his glory and you also were included in christ when you
[370.70 --> 377.96]  heard the message of truth the gospel of your salvation when you believed you were marked in him with a seal
[377.96 --> 385.52]  the promised holy spirit who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are
[385.52 --> 396.00]  god's possession to the praise of his glory amen amen amen and so the passage that we just read is actually
[396.00 --> 402.36]  really difficult to break down in our english language because from the original greek that we translate from
[402.36 --> 411.58]  these verses from 3 to 14 is one sentence this kind of song of praise that breaks out in paul's letter to
[411.58 --> 418.26]  the ephesians it's one single sentence in the greek that's why everything is connected and in our verses
[418.26 --> 424.12]  the numbers that which didn't exist in the original manuscripts the way we translate them and we number
[424.12 --> 430.46]  them it's hard it's difficult to place because it's one sentence where do you where's the comma where's the
[430.46 --> 439.64]  break how do you split this into kind of coherent um a letter a passage and so looking at that and reflecting
[439.64 --> 447.48]  on that fact that this is one long sentence i want to suggest that paul here is just overjoyed and
[447.48 --> 454.04]  filled with passion as he writes to the believers in ephesus so in other words it's like this he's kind of
[454.04 --> 461.48]  passionate full of emotion as he writes and saying dear brothers and sisters of ephesus and to us as well
[461.48 --> 469.26]  brothers and sisters of hope i really really want you to know this i praise god our father and our lord
[469.26 --> 475.26]  christ is the king of the lord jesus christ because jesus has now ascended to his rightful throne and from there he
[475.26 --> 483.26]  rules with justice and love the throne jesus sits on is his rightful throne and from there he has all authority
[483.26 --> 491.26]  and power but also he has the love of god that is that is ruled out in his kingdom so this is the continuation of the good news the
[491.26 --> 504.22]  gospel story the significance of jesus ascending to his heavenly throne is that from there he continues to reign
[504.22 --> 512.78]  and rule as the true king of all creation and now has invited us as his people his church and equips us to
[512.78 --> 521.02]  live out his rule on earth as it is in heaven that's the good news and his ascension we have to note
[521.26 --> 526.54]  is not just some one-time event that we cheer for yay okay that happened and then we move on from
[527.42 --> 533.18]  what we as a church throughout history have done well with is usually christmas and easter jesus came
[533.18 --> 539.18]  to die for our sins he came as a baby he was born on christmas so we celebrate that and for easter he has
[539.18 --> 545.98]  defeated the power of death and sin so we celebrate the resurrection and rightly so but one thing where we
[545.98 --> 550.94]  sort of fall short is we don't emphasize or celebrate the ascension of christ as much
[552.38 --> 558.06]  because the ascension is not just one little tiny thing that happened we go oh yeah right jesus ascended
[558.78 --> 566.30]  it's a point in history that has ongoing impact in the life of the church and the life and and for the
[566.30 --> 574.22]  whole world for all generations do you believe this because if you do if you believe that the ascension of
[574.22 --> 581.66]  christ has significance for our lives today then your life cannot and will not be the same before you
[581.66 --> 589.18]  knew this mystery that is revealed for us this is the word that paul uses in in scripture the mystery
[589.18 --> 595.82]  that is revealed to us in verse 8 to 9 of our passage he says that with all wisdom and understanding
[596.54 --> 604.22]  god made known to us the mystery of his will and the greek word musterion does not
[604.22 --> 609.02]  signify some sort of incomprehensible knowledge like oh it's a mystery no one can know it
[609.90 --> 619.50]  this word simply signifies a secret a long kept secret that has now been revealed to us through christ
[619.50 --> 627.34]  that's what the word signifies and so for us who have been revealed this mystery what mystery what secret
[627.34 --> 635.74]  the secret the secret the revealed secret for us that jesus is on his throne and with all authority and
[635.74 --> 643.58]  power and love he's loving the whole world back to redemption to restoration to bring unity and shalom to all
[643.58 --> 650.06]  things and that's the hope that we have and that's the mystery that is revealed for us and so as a people
[650.06 --> 659.74]  who know who know this mystery then we are equipped to further witness to the world that desperately needs
[659.74 --> 667.98]  this hope as well on his throne jesus commissions us as dave mentioned last week with the great commission
[669.10 --> 676.38]  we are also sent we are blessed with every spiritual blessing and we are now sent to make disciples of all
[676.38 --> 683.42]  nations right that is our witness that is our mission to make disciples of all nations baptizing them in
[683.42 --> 689.02]  the name of the father the son and the holy spirit that we get to teach and we get to share the life of
[689.02 --> 697.18]  everything that was taught to us by our king and savior jesus so it's not some sort of religion or tasks that
[697.18 --> 704.30]  we need to accomplish it is a way of life because we know and we are people who believe that jesus has ascended to
[704.30 --> 712.70]  his rightful place that he continues to rule and one of the blessings that's mentioned specifically
[712.70 --> 721.18]  is is described by paul in verse 4 for us paul says in verse 4 that god chose us in him that is in christ
[721.90 --> 729.02]  before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight that one verse is packed full of
[729.02 --> 738.62]  significance for our christian identities first it's the gospel truth that god chose us not us choosing him
[740.30 --> 747.66]  we love because god first loved us not the other way around the miracle of salvation isn't that we
[747.66 --> 755.02]  somehow put enough things together in our lives and started living for god the miracle of salvation is that god chose us
[755.02 --> 762.78]  even if you grew up in the church like i did we can all wrestle like even if you identify yourself as a christian all your life
[763.50 --> 768.86]  we can all wrestle with doubt and faithless faithlessness throughout our lives
[770.14 --> 778.30]  but the one foundation that we have is that god in our past present and future does not give up on us does not stop
[778.30 --> 785.02]  loving us with his unconditional love and he continues to invite his children into adoption into his family
[786.30 --> 794.54]  hence we confess with paul we are saved by grace through faith not by works so that no one can boast it is
[794.54 --> 803.18]  not up to us we are not on the throne deciding whether we are saved or not this is solely by the grace of god
[803.18 --> 809.90]  who has called us who has called us into adoption to his family that's the good news that god is on the throne
[810.46 --> 822.94]  not us second we are chosen in christ for what purpose we are chosen in christ to be holy and blameless paul says
[823.50 --> 828.06]  holy and blameless and that's what i would say is our missional identity
[828.06 --> 835.66]  because we are people who live as god's children who live under the true reign of jesus our king and savior
[836.14 --> 839.18]  we are called to be holy and blameless just as he is
[840.94 --> 849.02]  being holy is not some fancy term to signify general goodness here and if you're like me and you have many
[849.98 --> 857.26]  good friends i i have a lot of friends that are not christians that do not profess that jesus is their savior and lord
[857.90 --> 866.14]  but they are kind they are genuine they are honest and they are what i would say reflecting god's image
[866.14 --> 875.18]  deeply but holiness here in our christian identity signifies a very simple meaning in that we are set
[875.18 --> 883.18]  apart that's what holy means or kadosh in hebrew it just simply means set apart separated from the rest of
[883.18 --> 891.82]  the world the question we should be asking is how are we holy so how are we set apart and it's a sunday
[891.82 --> 897.34]  school answer although it's expressed differently in paul's letters what's the sunday school answer for
[897.34 --> 904.54]  everything jesus how does paul say it in two words it was repeated all throughout the passage that we read
[905.18 --> 915.58]  two words in christ that's how we are holy in christ it is first and foremost a belonging
[916.46 --> 923.82]  to jesus christ our lord and savior that's how we are set apart not through things that we do not through
[923.82 --> 928.70]  some general good things that we check off and say okay i've done enough of these things and now i'm
[928.70 --> 937.10]  righteous now i'm holy i'm good enough right no as we just looked at it is solely by the grace of god
[937.10 --> 945.90]  that he chose us in him in christ to belong to him and that's our separating marker as paul says we are marked
[945.90 --> 957.82]  with a seal that we belong to christ so even though we are not perfect or better yet because we are not perfect
[958.46 --> 966.62]  god by his grace chose us in christ to be blameless to be holy to be perfect to be pure just as he is
[967.26 --> 974.78]  even in our broken selves we are clothed with grace we are clothed with the righteousness righteousness of christ
[976.38 --> 981.02]  where now we can have restoration relationship with our father in heaven
[983.58 --> 989.66]  and that's how the world sees us as holy and set apart that's our missional identity that i mentioned
[990.38 --> 999.18]  even in our imperfection god's love over through overflows through our lives and practically speaking
[999.82 --> 1005.50]  the source of this overflow not something that we've done not something that we are all self-righteous
[1005.50 --> 1011.98]  about but out of god's grace and out of his love and the overflow of this love to our neighbors the
[1011.98 --> 1020.46]  source of this love is our deep deep dependence as we live with hope and trust that everything is in
[1020.46 --> 1026.78]  god's hands that's the significance again of jesus being on the throne he continues even right now
[1028.14 --> 1035.10]  to reign as a true king and he is in control even in times where it feel it may feel like it's not
[1036.78 --> 1045.02]  to sum up this section we are a holy set apart people who put our hope in christ because we have faith we have
[1045.02 --> 1051.66]  trust that one day we will get to live in new creation in new resurrected bodies that one day the victory won by
[1051.66 --> 1061.10]  jesus on the cross is what we live for is our hope that all things will be made new again and we have
[1061.10 --> 1068.06]  confidence in that and so until that full restoration we know that even in seeming chaos
[1068.06 --> 1078.94]  that's the confidence that's the confidence that's the confidence that overflows from the trust that we
[1078.94 --> 1086.14]  have in christ just as the old testament prophet jeremiah expressed he had the same hope even though
[1086.14 --> 1092.22]  he did not see the the fulfillment of god's plan through his son jesus christ he knew what was being
[1092.22 --> 1098.94]  foreshadowed and him being the prophet of god he says this exact same thing as he prophesies and he
[1098.94 --> 1106.94]  blesses he says blessed is the man who trusts in the lord whose confidence is in him they will be like a
[1106.94 --> 1114.46]  tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream it does not fear when heat comes its leaves
[1114.46 --> 1123.50]  are always green it has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit and so the
[1123.50 --> 1130.14]  confidence that we have in our faith and as we dwell and as we live out our kingdom identities that we
[1130.14 --> 1140.22]  live under the reign of our true king jesus we will never fail to bear fruit that's god's grace overflowing
[1140.22 --> 1148.06]  through our lives so that's the confidence side of our faith this i suggest has to be held together
[1148.06 --> 1155.58]  always with lament these are the two things that we hold in our hands in our faith we have confidence
[1155.58 --> 1162.46]  and we have faith and assurance that jesus is king but on the other side we lament it's a not yet of a
[1162.46 --> 1171.34]  broken world our faith is not naive we don't pretend that all things are perfect just because we're christians
[1171.34 --> 1177.26]  but because we belong to christ everything is now all solved and everything is just perfect and peachy
[1178.62 --> 1184.70]  from his throne jesus hears our our cries of pain and suffering
[1184.70 --> 1193.66]  jesus listens intently to our spoken and oftentimes unspoken prayers of suffering
[1195.42 --> 1201.82]  and so it's a vital christian practice and so we should be praying to god in lament in prayers out of
[1201.82 --> 1210.14]  suffering and that leads to ultimately the prayer that the psalmist also prays how long lord will you
[1210.14 --> 1218.30]  forget me forever how long until all the suffering and the injustice ends how long until you come back
[1218.30 --> 1219.58]  and restore all things
[1223.74 --> 1231.10]  jesus hears these cries of pain and he doesn't just sit on a distant throne closing off his ear and saying
[1231.10 --> 1235.50]  that's not my problem anymore i'm i'm on the throne i've accomplished my mission i'm done
[1235.50 --> 1246.70]  jesus listens to every prayer that we pray to him and his heart breaks for the world and he says also to
[1246.70 --> 1254.14]  add on top of that he blesses those who mourn with him for the brokenness of the world as part of the
[1254.14 --> 1262.46]  beatitudes jesus blesses those who mourn for they shall be comforted he says and so it's part of our blessed
[1262.46 --> 1267.82]  identity to lament that the brokenness and suffering of the world even through the struggles of pain
[1268.38 --> 1276.30]  loss broken relationships broken health broken bodies through disease and sickness whatever we go through
[1276.86 --> 1284.86]  and we will go through difficulties god says he's with us forever and that we continue to be holy not
[1284.86 --> 1288.78]  because we somehow achieve some sort of victory over all the suffering
[1288.78 --> 1296.86]  no because we depend in the one who has achieved that for us we hope in the one who reigns and who
[1296.86 --> 1301.18]  rules with justice and love throughout all the brokenness of the world
[1303.66 --> 1311.82]  and one of my favorite passages from hebrews captures this perfectly the writer says therefore since we have
[1311.82 --> 1317.98]  a great high priest who ascended into heaven onto his rightful throne jesus the son of god
[1317.98 --> 1325.10]  god let us hold firmly to the faith we profess for we do not have a high priest who is unable to
[1325.10 --> 1332.78]  empathize with our weaknesses but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we are yet he was
[1332.78 --> 1343.02]  without sin he overcame the powers of sin let us then approach god's throne of grace with confidence so
[1343.02 --> 1351.98]  that we may receive grace and mercy in our time of need that's what we need desperately but also that's
[1351.98 --> 1355.66]  exactly what the world needs and they're desperate for it
[1359.50 --> 1365.58]  so we hold hope and expectation in one hand fully confident that jesus will return and make all things new
[1365.58 --> 1372.54]  and on the other hand again we lament at the not yet brokenness of the world that we live in
[1374.70 --> 1379.74]  so thinking about this lament part i just couldn't let it go throughout the week as i was preparing for
[1379.74 --> 1389.10]  this sermon i couldn't shake off this question of how long why the delay jesus why don't you just come now
[1389.10 --> 1397.10]  i feel like i've suffered enough and maybe i haven't i feel like there has been thousands of years of
[1397.10 --> 1406.54]  suffering and brokenness chaos all over the world so why are you not coming yet what's the delay
[1408.62 --> 1415.98]  i want to suggest as i did at the beginning of the sermon if he was here if jesus was really here
[1415.98 --> 1421.50]  in person it's one thing to think about whether we would actually be able to acknowledge and follow
[1421.50 --> 1427.74]  his ways or doubt like his disciples did i would say personally i think i would have a lot of struggles
[1428.30 --> 1435.02]  even if jesus were here the other side of this i would suggest that it's a gift that we don't know when
[1435.02 --> 1442.86]  jesus comes back because can you imagine let's say as many christians have done in the past
[1442.86 --> 1449.98]  that we knew the exact time and place of when jesus would return so like just to throw a random date
[1449.98 --> 1456.62]  out there like august 31st 2025 jesus is coming back now i'm not i'm not prophesying this is just
[1456.62 --> 1464.46]  okay this is not heresy this is just an example let's just say that the date is fixed august 31st 2025
[1464.46 --> 1467.34]  pst okay like in our time here
[1469.98 --> 1476.94]  how would you live so we have about a year left what would your life look like would you now start
[1476.94 --> 1481.90]  getting yourself together so that you can prepare for the for the one year when jesus comes back
[1482.94 --> 1487.34]  or would you be like kind of like me where i lean to whenever i have papers due or there's a deadline
[1487.34 --> 1494.22]  for something what do you do you hold it off until the last possible minute enjoy life as much as you can
[1494.46 --> 1499.58]  and then oh right it's august okay i gotta get myself together jesus is coming back
[1501.74 --> 1506.54]  wherever you lean to both of these things are founded on wrong motivations
[1507.98 --> 1512.62]  the reign and rule of christ is a way of life not a check off list things to do
[1513.58 --> 1516.78]  oh yeah august 31st i'll start on august 1st and go from there
[1516.78 --> 1526.38]  the life we have under the reign of christ is our whole lives every single moment every single
[1526.38 --> 1531.74]  second of our lives belongs to him that's what it means to live in his reign
[1534.38 --> 1541.10]  it's a life that is deeply rooted in the hope of jesus restoring all things that's where our hope lies
[1541.10 --> 1548.94]  as one commentator said it well it is our sharing in a new life the very life of christ himself
[1550.38 --> 1557.82]  therefore god's blessings come to us and crystal in christ not just through the agency of christ not
[1557.82 --> 1565.50]  just because we somehow live in the space defined by christ but also because we live in christ united with
[1565.50 --> 1575.98]  him sharing in his life and love so in your day to day ordinary life at home at work at school at play
[1575.98 --> 1583.26]  it's all for god it's all for the glory of our lord and that's the foretaste of god's kingdom
[1584.06 --> 1591.10]  that no matter what we face we know that we live in his kingdom right now right here
[1591.10 --> 1600.70]  time space whatever it is god's heavenly kingdom is here and we live we live that out as we confess
[1600.70 --> 1606.46]  and we profess our faith in him in jesus who is the true king and lord of our lives
[1608.06 --> 1613.98]  and so as pastor dave put it last week and as i mentioned that sneak preview that we got to see
[1613.98 --> 1620.94]  through the ministry of jesus that's what we also offer for the world as we really live in
[1620.94 --> 1627.50]  dependence of god's reign on earth as it is in heaven that sneak preview is seen by the rest of
[1627.50 --> 1635.90]  the world as we live it out in our mountains and valleys so in other words our joys and our sadness
[1635.90 --> 1643.74]  we can say all is well praise be to god and our lord jesus christ there is joy because the work is
[1643.74 --> 1649.74]  finished and the rightful king is on the throne even now and we also lament at the same time at the
[1649.74 --> 1654.22]  brokenness at the not yet and we break our hearts with him
[1658.30 --> 1665.66]  and in all this we look forward to a day when the times reach their fulfillment as paul says in verse 10
[1666.70 --> 1673.90]  when the times reach their fulfillment all things in heaven and on earth will be brought in unity in christ
[1673.90 --> 1679.74]  we look forward to a day of shalom when all things will be made new
[1682.22 --> 1686.22]  and so what does that mean for you how does that impact your life today
[1688.30 --> 1694.78]  because today is ascension sunday i've tried my best to hold off speaking about the holy spirit until now
[1694.78 --> 1702.06]  but it's impossible to witness faithfully to scripture without mentioning that jesus who is on
[1702.06 --> 1711.82]  the throne is with us right now how through his holy spirit we are empowered by his spirit to live out
[1711.82 --> 1717.34]  this kingdom life again not in our own power not in our own strength but the strength that is provided
[1717.34 --> 1723.66]  is provided and gifted to us by the holy spirit who lives in us and so for the next few weeks we get to
[1723.66 --> 1731.26]  look at what that means practically throughout our lives how the holy spirit guarantees our inheritance until
[1731.82 --> 1738.62]  god's people the redemption of god's possession god's family happens when the times reach their fulfillment
[1738.62 --> 1748.22]  the holy spirit is the deposit guaranteeing our inheritance paul says something that the world cannot offer no
[1748.22 --> 1754.94]  matter what achievements and success we can have there is a hope and confidence that no other can give
[1756.30 --> 1763.98]  this way of life living in christ under his rightful rule is spirit-led the spirit gives us hope and
[1763.98 --> 1771.74]  confidence and i believe that the world will see it and they will want it not because we are better or more
[1771.74 --> 1779.02]  self-righteous but because we have a hope and confidence in christ and so may that be our confession and our
[1779.02 --> 1786.14]  prayer this morning hope we live in the guidance of god's holy spirit and we live under his rightful rule
[1786.70 --> 1793.82]  that is our confidence and our hope that is the faith that we lean on our foundation as we journey through
[1793.82 --> 1801.98]  the ups and downs of our lives of our kingdom lives that's how we are light for the world in darkness
[1803.02 --> 1809.66]  that is our missional identity our blessed missional identity let's pray
[1809.66 --> 1818.70]  loving father
[1818.70 --> 1827.34]  we come before you and we give you thanks for sending your son jesus to die for us on the cross
[1828.54 --> 1832.86]  to be resurrected and to defeat the sin to defeat the power of sin
[1832.86 --> 1842.54]  and death death once and for all and lord we thank you that you have ascended to heaven that you sit on
[1842.54 --> 1850.22]  your rightful throne and you continue to reign with ultimate wisdom with all authority and with love
[1851.42 --> 1858.06]  that you continue to love our world toward redemption and restoration that you will bring shalom
[1858.06 --> 1868.78]  you will fully restore this world as it is in heaven we thank you for this gospel truth we thank you that
[1868.78 --> 1875.10]  that you have called us and invited us to join you in this kingdom life even now as we look ahead to this
[1875.66 --> 1883.26]  beautiful image of shalom may we live deeply into this faith that we profess may we live with this confidence that we have
[1883.26 --> 1893.50]  that you have gifted and blessed us with may be may we be a light for the darkness around us through this confidence that we have in you
[1894.22 --> 1899.82]  we thank you for this we thank you for your love in jesus name we pray amen
[1901.58 --> 1904.78]  i invite you to stand as we sing overcome
