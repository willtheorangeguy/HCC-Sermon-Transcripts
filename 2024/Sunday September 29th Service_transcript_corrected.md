[0.00 → 11.12] well good morning everyone if you haven't been here for the past couple weeks we're in the
[11.12 → 14.98] middle of a sermon series called contrast community we're looking at the distinctive
[14.98 → 21.80] practices and the way of life that the church has been invited into that enable us to bear witness
[21.80 → 27.62] to Jesus in our city, and we haven't pointed this out yet but these banners were made by our hope
[27.62 → 32.68] art collective to describe our community, and you'll notice that our church is actually in the
[32.68 → 37.32] banner and so just think of the way in which our church is called not just as a building but as a
[37.32 → 43.32] community to be a light to Christ we've looked at how we are invited to be a community of sacrificial
[43.32 → 49.06] service in a world of self-elevation last week we looked at how we were called to be a community of
[49.06 → 54.72] dependent prayer in a community of self-sufficiency and this morning we're looking at what it means to
[54.72 → 62.76] be a community of rest in a world of hurry and worry and exhaustion and I just want you to know
[62.76 → 68.42] that I find these passages personally challenging and I think you might too so if you have your bible
[68.42 → 72.92] I want you to turn with me to two books at the beginning of the bible we're going to look at
[72.92 → 75.46] genesis 2 and then at exodus 20.
[81.78 → 89.04] by the seventh day god had finished the work he had been doing so on the seventh day he rested from
[89.04 → 94.96] all his work then god blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it, he rested from all the
[94.96 → 100.12] work of creating that he had done and now over to exodus 20.
[102.82 → 109.60] remember the sabbath day by keeping it holy six days you shall labour and do all your work but the
[109.60 → 116.90] seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on it, you shall not do any work neither you nor your son
[116.90 → 122.80] or daughter your male or female servant nor your animals or even foreign workers residing in your towns
[122.80 → 129.34] four in six days the lord made the heavens and the earth the sea and all that is in them, but he rested
[129.34 → 137.32] on the seventh day therefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy this is god's word
[137.32 → 149.28] there's an American cardiologist whose name is Meyer Friedman and as he studied various patients
[149.28 → 154.10] and he learned some of the stuff that seemed to be common among some of them he came up with a
[154.10 → 159.92] category to describe a disease a sickness that he was observing and this is the name of the sickness
[159.92 → 165.70] this is his original coining phrase hurry sickness have you heard of that phrase before
[165.70 → 172.82] and I'll give you his definition that he writes about in this he says hurry sickness is a continuous
[172.82 → 180.02] struggle an unremitting attempt to accomplish or achieve more and more things or participate in
[180.02 → 189.58] more or more events in less and less time and uh that might sound like efficient living to you
[189.58 → 195.86] but remember this is a sickness a disease that he was sort of diagnosing as he's seeing people
[195.86 → 202.26] come with serious heart issues as a cardiologist he's saying this is a problem and this is how I diagnose it
[202.26 → 210.12] now here's the real kicker you ready for it Meyer Friedman diagnosed hurry sickness in the 1950s
[210.12 → 217.86] you know what that means we're in trouble because in the 1950s are at least in my opinion as a
[217.86 → 226.02] millennial that was a quieter time that was a slower time that was before the invention of smartphones and
[226.02 → 232.16] laptops and Wi-Fi and streaming and all the stuff that makes our life so busy today, and it makes
[232.16 → 238.80] me wonder if Meyer Friedman were to sit down with you and me today would he not diagnose all of us
[239.52 → 247.04] with hurry sickness I won't make you raise your hand for this but how many of us feel hurry worried and
[247.04 → 254.96] exhausted even right now before we dive into the passage I'm just going to take a couple of minutes to give us a
[254.96 → 266.82] a lay of the land of the city that we live in the society we are growing up in many people have described North American society as a rat race
[266.82 → 276.96] you heard that phrase before that's not a kind image in my mind like a rat race like this scurried like frenzied way of living but that's the world we live in right
[276.96 → 290.96] we become masters of organizing and scheduling and packing things into our day we don't have enough time to eat so we Uber things to our home, or we stop by fast food on the way to the next work meeting we squeeze things in more and more
[290.96 → 302.96] we get up earlier, and we stay up later to accomplish all the things that we feel need to be done does this sound true for you just so you know I'm preaching to myself too
[302.96 → 316.96] and then there are these things who's got one of these oh man these things make hurry and put it on steroids right because you're always connected you're always on
[316.96 → 334.96] you're working your work email floods into your phone at all times of the day sometimes even through the night if you've got friends they're often messaging you day and night and if you're on WhatsApp group chats probably my least form of communication your phone will always be dinging and buzzing and I haven't even mentioned social media death scrolling
[334.96 → 346.94] it takes an incredible amount of discipline not to be on these things all the time and having all the worries that come with it one I didn't even mention either was just scrolling through the news and hopefully
[346.94 → 352.46] all the worries that pulls into our hearts and our minds and what is a new normal for us by the way I'll just
[352.86 → 368.94] embody this is for us to be on our phones scrolling through something texting someone and trying to have a half conversation with your spouse or your child or your friend and co-worker, and then you always say to them, you've done this haven't you were you're like pardon say that again because you weren't listening because you're on your device
[368.94 → 376.62] we're worried we're worried, and we're exhausted that's the nature of the society that we just grow
[376.62 → 382.78] up in its normal to us and now I'm going to ask some of the harder questions the first is why do we live this way
[383.42 → 388.86] like why do we live at a pace that is not sustainable that is not good for our hearts our bodies and our
[388.86 → 396.14] relationships and there are many answers to that one sociologist says there are two twin drugs that we all love
[396.14 → 403.42] one is accomplishment and I'll admit I like this one getting stuff done feels good knocking things off
[403.42 → 409.90] the to-do list making a new project building things that's very exciting for many of us the other one is
[409.90 → 419.18] accumulation we live in a consumer society the thing we want without ever saying it out loud is more and if
[419.18 → 425.26] you want the more of a consumer society you have to hustle right it doesn't just happen you have to hustle
[425.26 → 431.26] you have to work you have to make the most of your time to get ahead and after the 9am service I had two very
[431.26 → 436.38] honest sobering conversations with two young dads who are deep in their work right now with families
[436.38 → 442.06] to care for they just said like the demands are overwhelming like to not just run and do all the stuff
[442.06 → 445.18] of the corporate world is craziness the demands are great
[445.18 → 452.22] other reasons that we do more than our bodies can even handle or our minds can have capacity for
[452.94 → 457.18] is sometimes just the fear of missing out right we get invited to all these things we've got friends
[457.18 → 462.62] doing exciting things and the hardest thing for us to do is say no and then see someone post on social media
[462.62 → 468.78] that amazing event you said no to right it's tough and maybe even more personally
[469.74 → 474.30] some of us like being busy because we're a bit afraid of what we'll find out about ourselves that
[474.30 → 478.86] goes on in our minds and hearts when we become silent right I have to deal with the stuff that's
[478.86 → 484.54] going on within us that drives us and moves us and all the rest it's easier to stay busy than to deal
[484.54 → 492.54] with the stuff within for some of us and now some hard diagnostic questions okay how are you doing
[492.54 → 501.26] like actually how's your health how's your body where are you carrying all your stress
[502.94 → 507.98] it's probably not going to be a surprise to you that in some of the most recent studies I have read
[508.54 → 514.46] one in four people in North America quit or step down from their positions for a season because of
[514.46 → 520.30] stress anxiety and burnout and if we localize that to just our church that's like over a hundred people
[520.30 → 526.06] that will quit or step down from their positions just because of stress and burnout and if you don't
[526.06 → 531.42] know what burnout is your body saying even though you in your mind think you can do this
[531.42 → 536.38] I give up as your body, and now you have to deal with if it's actually a gift to us when we burn our
[536.38 → 542.54] because we have to stop and heal so that we can do our work in a better way but that's our reality
[542.54 → 546.38] and you probably won't be surprised to hear that almost every Canadian university in college is
[546.38 → 551.82] is scrambling and I should actually move that downgrade schools and high schools are scrambling
[551.82 → 556.06] to get all the support for the mental health crisis that is upon them with students
[556.94 → 565.26] from burnout to anxiety to chronic fatigue to all the rest it's real, and it's important just to
[565.26 → 569.66] highlight that these are students who aren't even yet in the heavy demands of many workplaces this is
[569.66 → 577.02] just the preparation and that to me is like this major red flag of something's not right in the
[577.02 → 582.38] society that we live in there's something fundamentally baked in that's wrong that's harming us it's harming
[582.38 → 589.98] our relationships it's harming our bodies, and we shouldn't be okay with it now to go another level closer
[590.86 → 598.30] how are your relationships like actually with your spouse your kids your parents your friends your
[598.30 → 604.06] co-workers I read years ago and I don't remember who said this, but it's stuck with me, it kind of
[604.06 → 609.98] burns a hole in my head and that's this you can't love well when you're in a hurry have you ever notice
[609.98 → 617.34] that you can't love well when you're in a rush you can try, but it's not going to happen in the same way
[617.34 → 621.90] you can't actually have deep relationships when you're in a hurry because relationships we all know
[621.90 → 627.74] this take time take attention take focus take stopping the other distractions so you can be present to
[627.74 → 633.74] somebody and if you're in a rush that's not going to happen and as a result another epidemic that's
[633.74 → 638.54] happening in our culture and abroad that doesn't get enough press time right now is loneliness
[639.98 → 645.34] we might be so successful in our careers so competent our workplace is cranking out so many hours
[645.34 → 653.26] but if we're honest with ourselves and others we are so lonely our hurry and our stress and our speed of
[653.26 → 660.38] life leaves us lonely and now perhaps to the most important question how is your relationship with
[660.38 → 671.26] god like when's the last time you stopped to listen to the living god speak to you when's the last time
[671.26 → 677.42] you actually were able to slow your heart and mind down to hear him by his words through prayer through
[677.42 → 688.14] friends or in worship are you able to actually stop and be attentive to god these are very important
[688.70 → 700.78] questions I want to say this now as strongly as I can god does not delight in our hurry god is not
[700.78 → 707.02] impressed by all that you and I can accomplish all that we can accumulate if it means we're living
[707.02 → 713.02] at a pace he didn't create us for if it means we're making sacrifices that he's not impressed by he's
[713.02 → 718.70] not impressed by the 70-hour work week you continue to crank out and sometimes even brag about while your
[718.70 → 724.46] family and loved ones eat without you around the table while the kids you raise are being put to bed
[724.46 → 731.10] without you night after night god is not impressed and more than that here's a line that I read years ago
[731.10 → 738.14] as well when we go against the grain of god's design we get splinters does that image make sense I grew up
[738.14 → 743.18] in a family my dad had a furniture company, so wood grain is an image that's strong for me but if you
[743.18 → 747.10] slide your hand one way it's going to be smooth, but you go the wrong way you're going to get lots of
[747.10 → 755.02] splinters in your hand, and it hurts and let me just say as clear as I can there are so many splinters in our
[755.02 → 761.42] society in our city in our families in our own lives from the speed of life that we are living at
[762.94 → 766.94] SID banner wood who is the one leading the service he opened up the service many of you know him
[768.22 → 773.26] he's had a heart attack, and he had a season where he to step away from work because of all the demands
[773.26 → 780.14] and Jonathan and i we said after the first service we make it our goal to not have a burnout in our 50s
[780.14 → 784.22] as a pastor because right now you probably know this too there are so many pastors quitting and
[784.22 → 787.82] burning out because the demands are so great, and we are committed to saying we're going to live at
[787.82 → 793.34] a pace in ministry where we can do the long haul because the way it's going in our society and in the
[793.34 → 801.66] church is not honouring god when you go against the grain of creation you get splinters so now let me
[801.66 → 807.50] ask you the question after all that heavy stuff are you ready to hear some good news are you ready to
[807.50 → 813.42] hear god teach us how he designed us to live in a way where you and I can flourish in our communities
[813.42 → 820.38] and our families and our work and not burn out because god created you, and he created me to rest
[821.90 → 829.34] receive that as a gift in fact not only that he commands you, and he commands me to rest and he
[829.34 → 835.58] invites us to receive the gift of sabbath and that's what we're going to talk about for the rest of
[835.58 → 840.38] this morning now if you grew up in the church maybe you know what sabbath is if you didn't it comes
[840.38 → 846.70] from this Hebrew word Sabbath which basically means to cease and oftentimes in the old and New Testament
[846.70 → 856.94] that just translates to rest to stop your work to cease your labour and rest and I want to read for us
[856.94 → 862.46] genesis 2 and reflect just briefly on the powerful words we read in the opening chapter of genesis
[863.42 → 869.82] we're told that on the seventh day god finished the work he had been doing so on the seventh day he
[869.82 → 876.06] rested from all his work then god blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it he
[876.06 → 884.70] rested from all the work of creating he had done first god rests did you hear that your god the
[884.70 → 890.30] living god rests now also let me point out god works one of the things we say in the church we do all of
[890.30 → 895.98] life interviews on the stage we want to underscore work is a gift not an enemy not a necessary evil
[895.98 → 902.22] work is a gift and god rests from his work not because he's exhausted by it but because he wants
[902.22 → 911.50] to now step back and delight in the beautiful stunning creation he made, and he invites humans to do it with
[911.50 → 917.50] him I mean think about the character of god here he steps back because he wants to, and he invites humans
[917.50 → 924.70] so that they too can delight in the beautiful creation the colour the beauty the views the smells
[924.70 → 932.54] the taste all of it he wants us to enjoy now I'm going to geek out on this with you just briefly
[932.54 → 938.38] there's some debate among scholars in genesis as to what is like the climax the pinnacle point in
[938.38 → 944.22] genesis 1 many will say it's the creation of Adam and eve right god creates all these parts of the
[944.22 → 950.14] world and then the final moment the crescendo is like male and female in god's image that's on the
[950.14 → 955.82] sixth day though and many have pointed out the seventh day is the day when god steps back and
[955.82 → 960.62] rests and invites them into it and I'm becoming increasingly convinced that actually the crescendo
[960.62 → 967.42] of the creation account is this new couple Adam and eve now being invited to delight in god's beautiful
[967.42 → 976.06] creation and rest the first item on their to-do list is rest doesn't that blow your minds the first thing
[976.06 → 982.62] that they get to do in god's beautiful world is just delight in it with him in his presence that's
[982.62 → 990.70] what genesis 2 is telling us in a book on sabbath by the author AJ stood this is what he writes sort
[990.70 → 996.54] of reflecting on Adam and eve's experience he says Adam and eve's first impression of god would have been
[996.54 → 1004.14] that god was no slave driver still today we are reminded of that truth each week when we take a
[1004.14 → 1011.74] day to rest in god's presence sabbath is a scheduled weekly reminder that we are not what we do I'm just
[1011.74 → 1021.34] going to say it again we are not what we do rather we are who we are loved by receive that sabbath and the
[1021.34 → 1027.50] gospel scream the same thing we do not work to get to a place where we finally get to rest that's
[1027.50 → 1035.50] slavery rather we rest and breathe and enjoy god that we might enter into that rest isn't that good news
[1037.58 → 1042.54] genesis and exodus together now I'm going to get into excess a little bit they give us the rhythm of
[1042.54 → 1049.82] creation they give us the design that god had for us and for his world it says we were created to work
[1049.82 → 1057.02] six days and rest one six plus one not seven plus zero and as maybe some of us need to hear this too
[1057.02 → 1064.30] not three plus four or four plus three six plus one six days you shall do your labour and all your work
[1064.30 → 1068.46] but on the seventh you will rest it's a sabbath day it's a holy day
[1071.10 → 1077.18] now I don't know if you need to hear this, but maybe there's some of us who love being busy, and we love
[1077.18 → 1083.98] working very hard and running at a million miles an hour, and maybe I'll just say it this way are you smarter than god
[1086.06 → 1090.86] do you know better than god how you were created for both work and for rest
[1094.06 → 1097.98] and now I want to talk for a moment about genus or exodus 20.
[1098.94 → 1104.30] I mean exodus 20 kind of blows my mind a little bit if you thought about if you had to give 10 commandments
[1104.30 → 1109.42] to a whole community about how they are to flourish how to organize society how to live
[1109.42 → 1117.34] well in community I bet you would not say rest and before god says anything about like coveting and
[1117.34 → 1123.74] murder and adultery and lying and stealing he says you have to rest he commands them to remember the
[1123.74 → 1129.26] sabbath day by keeping it holy and by the way that word holy just means set apart it's different from the rest
[1129.26 → 1135.74] six days you shall labour and do all your work, but the seventh is a sabbath day to the lord on it you
[1135.74 → 1144.46] shall not do any work how is your obedience to this command going by the way are you practicing sabbath
[1145.42 → 1149.82] I have this hunch tell me if I'm wrong that most Canadians were like yeah I don't want to covet I don't
[1149.82 → 1153.82] want to steal I don't want to commit adultery I don't want to murder like these are serious
[1153.82 → 1158.06] things I don't want to do but when it comes to sabbath you're like is it really that big a deal
[1158.06 → 1165.18] is it that important to rest like does god care that much about it is this resonating for you and
[1165.18 → 1170.70] in our surge group we do this nine-month discipleship group there's a number of people who just started
[1170.70 → 1175.82] we do these uh blessed rhythms, and we have to be accountable to them and one of those is sabbath and
[1175.82 → 1184.30] I'm always amazed by our creative and very insensitive excuses for not doing sabbath it's like oh yeah
[1184.30 → 1188.62] I had that exam the next day I had this thing I had to do this friend I had like all these things
[1188.62 → 1192.94] but as a result we just don't practice sabbath I don't think we have the guts to make that kind
[1192.94 → 1197.90] of excuse for all the other commands but when it comes to rest we're like ah not that big a deal
[1197.90 → 1204.70] because we live in a rat race society, but now that brings me to some words that have been ringing in
[1204.70 → 1209.26] my head this week and words that have actually been read twice in a row behind the pulpit
[1209.26 → 1217.74] and they come from jesus in Matthew 11 sorts of gives his own addition to this thing of rest god
[1217.74 → 1223.34] creates us for it, he commands us to practice it and then Jesus steps into history and this is what
[1223.34 → 1232.62] he says in Matthew 11 28 he says come to me all you who are what weary and burdened and I will give you
[1233.50 → 1239.10] rest, and he goes on to say take my yoke on you and learn from me for I'm gentle and humble
[1239.10 → 1246.86] and heart, and you will find rest for your souls and I'm still trying to work at what this all means
[1246.86 → 1252.78] for me so I'll invite you into it god creates us for rest he commands that we practice rest and Jesus
[1252.78 → 1259.02] says come to me and I will give you rest in a very real sense he says rest is not just something you do
[1259.02 → 1264.38] it's a relationship you have with me there's something about being in the presence of Jesus that
[1264.38 → 1271.42] gives us the deepest rest we can find there's something about rest that is a person and you
[1271.42 → 1275.50] know this right when you're close to Christ when you're in conversation with Christ there's a way
[1275.50 → 1281.18] in which he gives you restoration and healing that nothing else can give you it's a rest that only comes
[1281.18 → 1284.70] from the source of life and that is Jesus Christ our resurrected king
[1287.10 → 1293.02] there's a writer by the name of saint Augustine, and he had quite an interesting journey a very influential
[1293.02 → 1297.82] writer in the Christian faith but very struggle like that guy had major struggles as a young
[1297.82 → 1302.86] adult to follow Jesus particularly when it came to sexual faithfulness, and he wrote a book called
[1302.86 → 1309.50] confessions I commend it to you, it's a very powerful book and this is what he writes in it, you have made us
[1309.50 → 1319.58] for yourself oh lord and our heart is restless until it rests in you does that resonate
[1319.58 → 1329.18] in fact when I think of Canadian society I think man we are so restless we don't even know what to do
[1329.18 → 1333.66] with silence we don't know what to do with meditation or being by ourselves or turning off the screens we
[1333.66 → 1338.78] don't even know who we are by ourselves and I just hear Augustine saying I've been there, and we are
[1338.78 → 1348.06] restless until we find Jesus the source of rest, and we sang earlier that line I really love this line
[1348.06 → 1355.50] he is the well that does not run dry and our wells run dry all the time we run ourselves ragged and we
[1355.50 → 1362.86] come to Jesus this source of life this deep well of life, and he gives that to us and come to me weary and
[1362.86 → 1368.94] burdened and I will give you rest for your souls and I think there is for each of us a very personal
[1368.94 → 1374.62] invitation whatever the burdens are whatever the weariness is to come to Jesus and allow him
[1374.62 → 1379.02] to bring rest and restoration to our burdened and broken lives
[1381.42 → 1388.54] sabbath is about resting in the presence of Christ so that we can rest in his presence all week long
[1389.18 → 1395.10] it's about worshipping Jesus on Sunday as we are so that we can worship him all week long in our work
[1395.10 → 1400.94] in our labour it's about singing praises to the living god so that we can remember week after week
[1400.94 → 1409.98] Sunday after Sunday that god is god and you and I are not, and we don't have to try to be only what god can be
[1412.06 → 1418.46] Marva don is a professor a former professor at regent college and um she's in my opinion one of those
[1418.46 → 1423.42] women you meet, and she's a saint i I was so privileged to hear her teach and read her writing
[1423.42 → 1428.86] but she wrote extensively on sabbath and uh Marva don she wrote this book by the way it's called a
[1428.86 → 1436.46] royal waste of time I've always enjoyed that title a royal waste of time, and she says sabbath should be
[1436.46 → 1440.86] characterized by four things and if you're a junior youth, and you're taking sermon notes right now here
[1440.86 → 1447.26] are the four things I want you to write down you're getting the hint here sabbath comprises four
[1447.26 → 1455.18] things ceasing resting embracing and feasting can remember those things so if you're thinking like
[1455.18 → 1461.66] what does it mean to practice sabbath it's ceasing resting embracing and feasting ceasing our labour
[1462.54 → 1468.94] resting from our work embracing relationships and feasting in the goodness of god's creation
[1468.94 → 1476.46] with good food who doesn't like good food you know um some of us maybe grew up in the church and sabbath
[1476.46 → 1482.38] was like a bit of a legalistic thing right and i I can say that in the community I grew up in the
[1482.38 → 1486.94] church I grew up in it was almost like this is what you can do this is what you can't do make sure you
[1486.94 → 1491.50] don't do this make sure you do that and I think the intention was good, but it became this like what
[1491.50 → 1497.50] am I allowed to do thing what I want you to hear in this invitation for sabbath is the invitation to enjoy
[1497.50 → 1506.70] the fullness of god's good creation relationships and food and the gift of rest what a gift that god
[1506.70 → 1513.74] created you and i to labour and to nap right to-do lists where we work through them throughout the week
[1513.74 → 1519.90] and then the gift of going outside and playing with your kids the gift of having things that you need to
[1519.90 → 1525.98] do, and you're gifted for and labour in, and then you just get to eat a good meal with your family and
[1525.98 → 1532.54] your friends I grew up in a family uh in a Dutch community and the Dutch people do Sundays pretty
[1532.54 → 1537.26] well I have to say like we go to church we come home from church yeah you know what I'm going to say
[1537.26 → 1542.54] and we have this great tradition you eat desert before lunch such a good tradition whenever we have
[1542.54 → 1546.46] people who are not from the Dutch background they're like why do you do this backwards I'm like of
[1546.46 → 1551.34] course it is, but it's Sunday that's what we do I don't know why, but you have a late you know dessert
[1551.34 → 1558.06] then you have lunch at like 4 p.m and dinner at like 7 or 8 or 9 it's amazing, and we just enjoy food
[1558.06 → 1562.30] together my tape my home is full of people around the table from our church our extended family and
[1562.30 → 1568.06] what a gift it is to feast together without any pressures to do the work email and do the stuff that's
[1568.06 → 1573.90] waiting for you on Monday morning just to enjoy the goodness of god's creation and enjoy meals together
[1573.90 → 1582.38] don't you want to recover this now I'm aware I'm not uh ignorant of the pressures we all face many
[1582.38 → 1587.74] of us have shifted work many of us have kids and various demanding things and sports and all the rest
[1587.74 → 1594.54] and I realize it takes what I think is creative commitment I can't solve your
[1594.54 → 1599.58] schedule but I'm sure there are ways you can adjust it so that you can enjoy the gift of sabbath
[1599.58 → 1605.02] and ideally if possible a 24-hour block for some people and I have family members for whom this is
[1605.02 → 1609.74] true sabbath is Friday to Saturday because Saturday is actually the easiest day for them for other
[1609.74 → 1615.90] people it's Saturday to Sunday or in my case it's Sunday to Monday right and I know people in fact some
[1615.90 → 1620.62] family members of mine and friends the way they start sabbath matters they have a family meal and they
[1620.62 → 1625.26] light a candle and I think that's such a good practice it's just one small way of saying this day
[1625.26 → 1630.38] today is different, and we're now around the table, and we are starting sabbath together
[1631.18 → 1635.50] and other practices and this is one we've tried to implement with varying degrees of success in our
[1635.50 → 1642.54] family as we call it tech free sabbath and you know where this is going right we put our screens
[1642.54 → 1646.78] away and that that's uh I think Britney and I are probably the worst at this actually
[1647.58 → 1651.98] but we say to our kids like it's Sunday let's enjoy relationships let's go outside let's go for a walk
[1651.98 → 1655.74] let's have some people over let's go to some people's houses but let's put the screens away
[1656.38 → 1659.66] because you know this the second you pull your screens out you're not in conversation with each
[1659.66 → 1666.06] other right screens dominate so many hours per day, and you will be amazed at how much time you get back
[1666.06 → 1670.70] if you put your screen away if you put your phone on silent you leave your phone out of the room it
[1670.70 → 1677.58] will be a gift to you to your family and to your friends take work email off your phone silence the group
[1677.58 → 1687.50] chats and begin to enjoy the gift of sabbath for many people is just a gift that's waiting to be
[1687.50 → 1697.26] unfolded and enjoyed and I'll finish with this sabbath might be one of the most prophetic and beautiful
[1697.26 → 1704.78] things we can invite our society into they live in a rat race you live in a rat race it's time for us to
[1704.78 → 1709.58] get off that rat race and invite people into a different way of living the way we were created
[1710.14 → 1718.54] let's show our society how to rest let's show them how to enjoy relationships and not be lonely
[1718.54 → 1723.74] let's show them how to put the screens away and invest in the beauty of god's world and the beauty
[1723.74 → 1731.42] of good food around the table with loved ones and friends let's show our society how to enjoy the creation
[1731.42 → 1736.86] rather than rush our whole life away only to burn out and be anxious and exhausted
[1738.06 → 1743.02] and it might just be the case that that will be your best witness especially if you live in a very
[1743.02 → 1747.66] demanding job in a very demanding workplace you're going to be the one who shows up rested
[1748.62 → 1753.26] working with a different pace to you, and it's going to be that pace that rhythm that health that
[1753.26 → 1758.14] you bring to the workplace that will make people think what are you doing differently that's making
[1758.14 → 1764.70] you less worried less hurried and less exhausted, and you then get the opportunity to point people to
[1764.70 → 1771.90] Jesus right who in his death and resurrection liberated you from the slavery to accumulation the
[1771.90 → 1780.54] slavery to accomplishment and all the rest so that you can live in his presence and find in Jesus Christ
[1780.54 → 1785.34] the deepest source of rest let's pray together
[1792.46 → 1798.46] father we just thank you for the gift of your word and that you're the kind of god who commands rest
[1800.86 → 1807.98] and I feel the need to pray on all of our behalves a prayer of confession that we are way too rushed
[1807.98 → 1816.54] we are too hurried for relationship with others and relationship with you and would you have mercy on us
[1818.46 → 1827.66] would you teach us how to slow down would you teach us how to be attentive to those around us
[1829.34 → 1831.18] would you teach us how to be attentive to you
[1831.18 → 1838.14] father we ask that you would fill us with your spirit in a way that makes us silent
[1839.50 → 1848.14] and enjoy the world you've placed us in because you are no slave driver you do not delight in our
[1848.14 → 1857.10] exhaustion so teach us lord to rest that we may know how to be refreshed in you amen
[1857.10 → 1863.58] I invite you to stand with me and sing a song of response called oh come to the altar which really
[1863.58 → 1865.58] you
