[0.00 → 10.48] Well, good morning again, Hope.
[12.44 → 19.82] As Ken shared for us, he emphasized our calling as disciples of Christ is to be humble.
[20.44 → 23.66] I think it's very appropriate that Ken emphasize that for us.
[23.88 → 28.82] As we come to the end of our long, long series on the book of Jude, yeah?
[28.82 → 32.00] Anyone else ready to be done with this series?
[33.94 → 43.16] For the last couple of weeks now, it feels like the other pastors, so Sid and Dave, have done the hard work and laid the groundwork, actually, for my sermon today.
[43.70 → 48.64] Like, they've gone through the weeds of the dangers of brokenness and of false teaching.
[49.16 → 55.90] Whereas today, I get to encourage our congregation with the beautiful gospel message of standing strong in our faith.
[55.90 → 70.28] And as the loving pastor, pastoral leader that Jude was, as he was writing to his congregation, he ends his letter with encouragement for his church back then, but also for us today.
[71.00 → 77.44] And as we have heard, just like the church back then, we have our own false teachings that we must deal with.
[77.44 → 86.22] And as I meditated and prepared for my sermon and thinking back, so our expert zoologist in our home is Joseph.
[86.52 → 88.54] So he's huge into animals.
[88.94 → 91.86] It's a constant conversation around our dinner table.
[91.94 → 93.60] We talk about animal facts all the time.
[93.60 → 106.32] But it occurred to me that Jude's encouragement, especially for the leaders of the church, is kind of reflected in the image of, you know, how certain animals have herds, right?
[106.74 → 119.46] And the way the herds work is they keep the weak and vulnerable animals in the middle, meaning that they have the stronger and more able-bodied animals on the outside as protection for the herd.
[119.46 → 124.34] And that, to me, is sort of the image that Jude wants to get across to us.
[124.58 → 130.72] A message for the leaders, whether it be in an official level or in a volunteer or small group level.
[131.06 → 137.66] Whatever the case, he encourages the church, every one of us, to stand strong in the faith together.
[139.14 → 145.16] We'll touch more on this later, but this imagery is the encouragement that Pastor Jude's letter has for us.
[145.16 → 153.34] As we face the dangers of false teaching and being conformed to the ways of this world, we are called to stand firm, right?
[153.50 → 160.82] Persevere, contend for our faith because—and we do this together because we need each other.
[160.82 → 171.00] This calling to contend for the faith is not an individual calling, but a call to hold to true gospel teaching, so doctrine,
[171.34 → 176.92] and to live out our faith together under the ultimate shepherd in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[177.46 → 180.88] That is our calling, and that is the calling of the church.
[181.30 → 186.76] And so if you have your Bibles with you, we turn one more time to that one tiny book right before Revelation.
[186.76 → 190.88] We turn to Jude in the last verses from 17 to 22.
[193.58 → 194.44] We read,
[194.44 → 199.60] But dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
[200.14 → 200.90] They said to you,
[201.10 → 206.08] In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.
[206.88 → 211.96] These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.
[211.96 → 219.68] But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,
[220.08 → 226.68] keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.
[227.62 → 230.10] And so be merciful to those who doubt.
[231.06 → 233.42] Save others by snatching them from the fire.
[233.86 → 240.46] To others, show mercy mixed with fear, hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.
[240.46 → 242.44] This is the word of the Lord.
[244.72 → 251.32] Now this, the initial verses from 17 to 19 were preached last week by Pastor Sid.
[251.74 → 256.58] And Sid said that he didn't want to steal anything from my sermon, so I just thought, oh, I'll steal from his sermon then.
[258.64 → 263.68] All kidding aside, the two keywords that I take away from our previous two sermons on Jude
[263.68 → 267.58] is the two keywords of doctrine and character.
[268.46 → 273.04] Doctrine, right teaching, and character, the living out of our faith.
[273.82 → 280.62] And these two things, this doctrine and character, both of these are the things that the false teachers failed at.
[281.44 → 286.94] See, when Jude says that these false leaders were following their ungodly desires
[286.94 → 292.70] and that they were immoral and sinful, he wasn't just calling them names because he didn't like them or something.
[293.42 → 297.72] He says that these leaders were ungodly in both doctrine and character.
[298.94 → 304.64] In other words, their whole life, word, and deed was not aligned to the way of Christ.
[305.58 → 309.86] Not just misaligned, not that they weren't trying hard enough,
[309.86 → 315.42] but they were intentionally not living to the way of Christ.
[316.52 → 322.60] They were living immoral lives because they judged, and they taught that their idea of freedom was right.
[323.16 → 326.90] They had this arrogance to them that nobody could tell them what to do,
[327.32 → 328.62] that they were in the right.
[329.12 → 330.38] It was wrong posture.
[330.38 → 334.08] And along that line of thinking of false teaching and doctrine,
[334.46 → 337.28] they were denying the lordship of Jesus himself,
[337.28 → 340.52] probably suggesting that Jesus was not fully human,
[340.80 → 347.16] that our physical, sinful, broken bodies are just a shell for our real existence as simply souls
[347.16 → 349.70] that'll fly and float away to heaven someday.
[350.62 → 355.32] That excused them to do whatever they could, they wanted to, in their physical bodies.
[356.32 → 361.36] And Pastor Dave said a couple of weeks ago that these false teachings, what we call heresies,
[361.88 → 363.58] they're not new, right?
[363.58 → 370.62] Heresies and false teachings have a way of re-presenting themselves in similar yet subtly different ways.
[371.92 → 375.54] So, thinking of that, what is the false teaching?
[376.12 → 378.48] And what does the culture tell us today?
[380.20 → 382.16] We say this all the time in our pulpit.
[382.42 → 384.36] Try to see if this is familiar to you.
[385.04 → 385.92] You do you.
[385.92 → 390.96] You're, quote-unquote, free to do whatever you want because that's real freedom.
[391.68 → 392.66] No restrictions.
[393.34 → 395.60] All of your life choices are in your hands.
[395.96 → 397.20] You control your destiny.
[397.62 → 398.76] There's no higher being.
[400.14 → 401.80] No one has authority over you.
[404.36 → 409.14] And part of this false teaching that our culture preaches at us and disciples us
[409.14 → 413.94] is a temptation that many of us face, especially if you grew up in the church.
[413.94 → 420.78] The temptation to fall into the thinking that our faith, the grace from the Lord of all creation,
[421.30 → 426.08] salvation itself, is just one little item in our shopping carts.
[426.82 → 426.94] Right?
[427.00 → 432.58] Dave used this image before of how Christians today define discipleship and following the way of Christ
[432.58 → 436.32] as just one more item to put in our consumer's shopping carts.
[436.32 → 438.32] Right?
[438.48 → 442.90] In other words, you can do whatever you want and live as if God's not part of your life,
[443.00 → 444.30] but you can still be Christian.
[445.54 → 448.76] Just have a Bible sitting in your bookcase somewhere that you never read.
[449.20 → 451.48] Or just wear a cross necklace.
[451.86 → 454.82] Or just have a Bible verse as the wallpaper on your phone.
[455.22 → 456.14] That's good enough.
[457.46 → 458.96] Nothing against those things.
[459.04 → 461.54] And if you have a cross necklace right now, I think they're beautiful.
[461.54 → 462.10] Right?
[462.40 → 464.48] That's not, I'm not speaking of those little things.
[464.60 → 471.74] I'm speaking against thinking that those little acts excuse us from doing whatever we want
[471.74 → 474.30] just because we're free in Christ.
[477.24 → 481.90] To be a disciple of Jesus, to be a real disciple of Jesus,
[482.38 → 485.76] is a calling to follow Him with our whole lives,
[486.18 → 490.62] our everything, in our doctrine and our character.
[491.54 → 496.44] And if we think we can somehow passively become a real disciple of Christ,
[496.54 → 499.96] that would be a huge misunderstanding of that calling we have.
[500.80 → 505.98] Because I suggest that there will be always something that pulls us away from God.
[506.54 → 508.76] If you're sitting passively and thinking,
[509.00 → 512.70] I'm going to naturally and automatically become a real disciple of Christ,
[513.52 → 519.62] then you're missing the big, huge aspect of our life everywhere
[519.62 → 521.42] that is pulling us away from God.
[521.56 → 525.30] Whether it be your own sinful nature, your own sinful desires,
[525.58 → 527.68] or whether it be the ways of the world,
[527.78 → 529.32] or whether it be the enemy himself,
[529.58 → 532.32] something will always pull you away from God.
[533.06 → 538.40] And so if you're not intentional about your discipleship to Jesus Christ as your Lord,
[538.74 → 540.24] then something will pull you away.
[540.24 → 543.70] This is exactly what John Mark Comer,
[544.06 → 548.34] a pastor and writer who is passionate about being intentional disciples of Jesus,
[548.58 → 550.52] says in his book about the rule of life.
[550.90 → 552.46] He says, as you will see on the screen,
[552.98 → 555.26] for those of us who desire to follow Jesus,
[555.78 → 558.58] there is the reality that we must turn and face.
[559.16 → 562.38] If we're not being intentionally formed by Jesus himself,
[562.58 → 568.12] then it's highly likely we are being unintentionally formed by someone or something else.
[568.12 → 570.00] And to go a little bit further,
[570.22 → 572.50] I suggest that the enemy loves,
[572.96 → 575.98] and that's his strategy to try and make us think,
[576.34 → 576.80] you're fine.
[577.48 → 578.00] You're okay.
[578.70 → 582.12] You don't even need to listen to this sermon from Jude
[582.12 → 584.98] saying that you need to stand firm in your faith.
[585.92 → 586.52] You're fine.
[587.22 → 588.36] You live in Canada.
[588.98 → 591.08] It's a Christian country for crying out loud.
[591.18 → 592.10] Don't worry about it.
[593.04 → 594.02] Everything is okay.
[594.42 → 596.62] You're not being formed by anything else.
[596.62 → 599.00] Just live life, and you do you.
[600.12 → 601.16] Do whatever you want.
[601.44 → 602.74] You're free as a Christian.
[605.16 → 606.70] This sort of message,
[607.02 → 610.40] which is very similar to what Pastor Jude is writing to for his church,
[610.72 → 613.02] this is what we term in today,
[613.16 → 614.06] in today's words,
[614.32 → 615.48] as cheap grace.
[616.98 → 618.16] Holding doctrine,
[618.70 → 618.84] right?
[619.00 → 620.60] Right teaching from the Word of God
[620.60 → 621.86] and holding character,
[622.26 → 624.06] right living from the living Word of God
[624.06 → 625.30] that is living in us,
[625.60 → 626.20] guiding us,
[626.30 → 628.66] to hold these two pillars of our faith lightly
[628.66 → 632.52] and to intentionally live contrary to that way
[632.52 → 635.22] requires a lot of arrogance.
[636.50 → 636.72] Right?
[636.76 → 638.28] It's again that humility piece.
[638.28 → 643.50] In order to live in that way,
[643.62 → 645.36] it requires a lot of arrogance
[645.36 → 647.92] and it cheapens the gift of grace
[647.92 → 649.72] that was given to us sinners
[649.72 → 651.30] from our loving Father.
[651.96 → 653.74] Because as one theologian put it,
[654.40 → 655.78] God's love for us
[655.78 → 658.34] requires an appropriate response.
[659.16 → 660.98] Without obedience to God's will,
[661.30 → 663.58] fellowship with God can be forfeited.
[663.58 → 667.50] And this is the danger of antinomian doctrine.
[669.74 → 670.88] Antinomian doctrine.
[671.54 → 672.28] Fancy words,
[672.54 → 673.80] which just simply means
[673.80 → 674.98] no rules,
[675.38 → 676.30] do whatever you want
[676.30 → 677.12] because you're saved.
[678.34 → 679.34] Sound familiar?
[681.18 → 683.44] This is Jude's harsh words
[683.44 → 685.32] against the false teachers of his day
[685.32 → 686.16] that live this way.
[686.56 → 688.34] And it's the same message for us.
[688.34 → 693.78] This is similar to what Jesus teaches too.
[694.20 → 695.60] Again, this is a little bit different
[695.60 → 697.16] because Jesus doesn't speak
[697.16 → 699.62] against antinomian doctrines,
[700.04 → 702.40] but he speaks to the wise and learned,
[702.70 → 704.56] the Pharisees and the teachers of the law
[704.56 → 706.36] who thought they had it all figured out.
[707.10 → 709.40] They weren't teaching the false teaching
[709.40 → 710.60] of antinomian doctrine,
[710.78 → 712.16] but they were the other extreme.
[712.50 → 713.76] They were burdening people
[713.76 → 715.54] with legalism and guilt
[715.54 → 716.84] because they said,
[716.84 → 719.24] that's the only way you identify
[719.24 → 720.34] as a people of God.
[720.66 → 721.70] So on one extreme,
[721.82 → 723.26] you have extreme legalism.
[723.46 → 724.54] On the other extreme,
[724.64 → 726.42] you have antinomian doctrine
[726.42 → 728.14] saying you can do whatever you want.
[728.88 → 732.08] And the heart of both of these false teachings
[732.08 → 734.92] was that they had the wrong character.
[735.40 → 737.36] They had the wrong heart and posture.
[737.92 → 738.20] Why?
[738.50 → 740.66] Because they had an arrogance about them.
[740.96 → 742.80] They thought they had it all figured out.
[744.06 → 746.42] I know exactly what God wants.
[746.84 → 748.88] You can't tell me otherwise.
[751.66 → 754.06] But Jesus, along with Jude,
[754.56 → 757.20] his message is a message of love,
[757.52 → 760.30] and it's good news for those that are sick,
[760.90 → 761.52] Jesus says.
[762.02 → 764.52] I have come as a healer for the sick,
[764.78 → 767.10] not for those who think they're healthy,
[767.42 → 769.74] who think that they have everything figured out.
[769.74 → 773.28] And Jude is writing to those
[773.28 → 776.88] who are struggling with that same humility,
[777.58 → 779.56] that same brokenness.
[780.20 → 783.22] And he wants to encourage those who are doubting
[783.22 → 785.70] because doubting, we all doubt.
[786.72 → 788.60] We can all doubt in our faith journeys.
[788.60 → 791.04] And he says to love one another
[791.04 → 792.88] and build one another up
[792.88 → 795.32] to stand firm in our faith.
[796.62 → 798.98] And that's the first encouragement from verse 20,
[799.10 → 799.80] as Jude says.
[800.60 → 802.34] But you, dear friends, beloved,
[803.04 → 804.76] by building yourselves up
[804.76 → 806.46] in your most holy faith
[806.46 → 808.60] and praying in the Holy Spirit.
[808.60 → 812.94] This image is sort of an architectural image
[812.94 → 813.86] that you,
[814.72 → 815.66] and I want to pause here
[815.66 → 816.66] and emphasize this point.
[816.92 → 818.48] Dave did it really well before.
[818.84 → 819.90] I think I have a better accent.
[820.28 → 821.56] We really need to retrieve
[821.56 → 823.02] in our Canadian English
[823.02 → 824.92] that this is not you singular.
[825.34 → 827.10] You individually saved souls
[827.10 → 827.84] gathered together
[827.84 → 828.84] because this is for you.
[829.10 → 831.60] No, it's always about you all.
[832.06 → 832.74] It's you all.
[833.24 → 833.42] Right?
[833.50 → 834.32] That Texan accent.
[834.70 → 835.02] You all.
[835.18 → 837.50] You need to build you all selves up.
[837.50 → 838.50] Okay?
[839.28 → 840.20] I know it sounds funny
[840.20 → 841.34] because we're not used to it.
[841.54 → 843.10] If I were preaching this in Dallas or something,
[843.20 → 843.64] they'd be like,
[843.68 → 844.72] oh, sounds great.
[845.90 → 847.52] You need to build your,
[847.70 → 849.54] all of yourselves up together
[849.54 → 851.94] in the teachings of the living Word of God.
[852.04 → 852.90] Again, doctrine.
[854.00 → 855.48] In community, through fellowship,
[855.92 → 857.52] holding each other in accountability
[857.52 → 859.20] with care and gentleness,
[859.50 → 861.38] through confession and forgiveness,
[861.68 → 865.56] through shared spiritual practices and rhythms,
[865.56 → 867.06] like praying together,
[867.06 → 868.86] which builds character.
[869.28 → 871.08] Again, doctrine and character
[871.08 → 873.16] founded in Jesus Christ.
[874.30 → 876.86] This is the same image that we get from Paul.
[876.96 → 879.20] This is not just Jude preaching to us.
[879.44 → 881.02] Paul says the same thing in Ephesians.
[881.66 → 883.00] You, right?
[883.14 → 884.04] Hear it, you all.
[884.04 → 887.56] You all are no longer foreigners and strangers,
[888.06 → 890.20] but fellow citizens with God's people
[890.20 → 892.20] and also members of his household,
[892.48 → 893.16] his family.
[894.74 → 896.34] You are built on the foundation
[896.34 → 899.24] of the apostles' and the prophets' doctrine,
[899.62 → 901.64] with Christ Jesus himself
[901.64 → 903.62] as the chief cornerstone.
[904.30 → 905.18] That's our foundation.
[906.42 → 908.28] In him, in Jesus Christ,
[908.62 → 909.94] the whole building,
[909.94 → 911.86] again, build yourselves up.
[911.86 → 914.34] The whole building is joined together
[914.34 → 917.92] and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
[919.52 → 920.90] That's the church.
[921.76 → 922.70] That's us.
[922.70 → 927.66] And notice that it's significant
[927.66 → 928.90] that Jude,
[929.26 → 931.06] out of all the spiritual practices
[931.06 → 932.18] that he could have named,
[932.70 → 934.56] he names and emphasizes just one.
[935.50 → 936.42] You know which one it is?
[937.78 → 938.72] It's prayer.
[939.60 → 940.88] Build yourselves up
[940.88 → 942.94] in the most holy faith
[942.94 → 945.46] and pray in the Holy Spirit.
[945.46 → 949.06] I have this,
[949.06 → 951.46] what do you call it,
[951.64 → 952.08] a frame
[952.08 → 953.82] that my mother-in-law got for me
[953.82 → 954.98] as my ordination gift.
[955.22 → 956.12] And it simply says,
[956.46 → 957.88] turn your worries into prayer.
[960.32 → 962.80] It means everything that we go through
[962.80 → 964.08] in our journeys of faith,
[964.82 → 966.30] it's founded in prayer
[966.30 → 967.36] because the Holy Spirit
[967.36 → 969.02] wants to hear from us,
[969.38 → 970.90] wants to hear our prayers.
[971.72 → 972.98] That's why we pray.
[972.98 → 975.96] And as one pastor put it,
[976.22 → 977.00] prayer is good
[977.00 → 978.44] because it's a practice
[978.44 → 979.80] of letting go
[979.80 → 981.20] and seeking help.
[982.14 → 982.94] And in a way,
[983.34 → 984.36] the act of prayer
[984.36 → 986.42] forces us to humble ourselves
[986.42 → 987.52] before God
[987.52 → 988.52] and before others
[988.52 → 989.68] to acknowledge
[989.68 → 991.62] that we don't have it all figured out
[991.62 → 992.86] and that we need help.
[993.30 → 994.10] All of us do.
[997.54 → 999.28] Now, I shared this in the 9 a.m.
[999.98 → 1000.78] and I said
[1000.78 → 1002.30] that I didn't get permission
[1002.30 → 1002.80] from my wife
[1002.80 → 1003.64] to share this story
[1003.64 → 1005.24] and I was going to try
[1005.24 → 1006.32] to get permission from her
[1006.32 → 1007.40] in between the service
[1007.40 → 1008.10] but I couldn't
[1008.10 → 1009.18] so I'll have to ask
[1009.18 → 1010.14] for apology twice
[1010.14 → 1010.82] as I'm going to share
[1010.82 → 1011.58] this story anyway.
[1013.40 → 1013.80] So,
[1014.04 → 1015.68] whenever Moon and I fight,
[1017.26 → 1018.38] as all couples do,
[1018.58 → 1018.94] Moon's like,
[1019.00 → 1019.98] hey, we don't fight that often.
[1020.26 → 1021.26] Yes, okay, fine.
[1021.44 → 1022.82] But when we do fight,
[1023.76 → 1025.02] there is this tendency,
[1025.22 → 1026.22] there is this like battle
[1026.22 → 1027.24] going on in my heart
[1027.24 → 1028.40] in the sense that
[1028.40 → 1029.38] I don't want to pray.
[1029.38 → 1031.10] So,
[1031.10 → 1032.96] when I'm in a tense moment
[1032.96 → 1034.28] or I'm in conflict with,
[1034.48 → 1035.20] especially with Moon,
[1035.42 → 1036.58] or with anybody actually,
[1037.08 → 1038.48] there is this tendency
[1038.48 → 1040.00] to not want to pray.
[1040.68 → 1040.98] Why?
[1042.12 → 1043.18] Because I know,
[1043.48 → 1044.60] I know for certain
[1044.60 → 1045.26] if I pray,
[1045.76 → 1047.42] I'm going to be humbled
[1047.42 → 1048.56] before God
[1048.56 → 1049.66] and before this person.
[1050.60 → 1051.58] It brings us
[1051.58 → 1052.74] to a place of humility.
[1053.04 → 1054.08] Doesn't that sound awesome?
[1054.08 → 1056.06] But why is that
[1056.06 → 1056.88] so hard to do?
[1058.38 → 1059.56] It's so hard
[1059.56 → 1060.66] to humble ourselves.
[1061.72 → 1062.96] But prayer is a practice
[1062.96 → 1064.14] that forces us
[1064.14 → 1064.98] to do so.
[1067.28 → 1067.88] So,
[1067.98 → 1068.86] whatever it looks like,
[1069.22 → 1070.36] however prayer sounds
[1070.36 → 1070.84] for you,
[1071.44 → 1072.32] the Holy Spirit
[1072.32 → 1073.66] wants to hear our prayers,
[1073.86 → 1075.24] to walk with us
[1075.24 → 1075.92] in our journeys
[1075.92 → 1076.56] through prayer.
[1077.98 → 1079.24] This is opposite
[1079.24 → 1080.20] and contrary
[1080.20 → 1080.96] to the world,
[1081.16 → 1081.56] again,
[1081.64 → 1082.24] that tells you,
[1082.42 → 1083.24] you have to figure
[1083.24 → 1083.98] everything out.
[1084.44 → 1085.72] It's your own wisdom
[1085.72 → 1086.44] and strength
[1086.44 → 1087.86] to solve all world's
[1087.86 → 1088.68] problems for you.
[1089.94 → 1090.34] But then,
[1090.44 → 1092.66] to be a contrast community
[1092.66 → 1094.40] is to be a community
[1094.40 → 1095.06] of prayer.
[1095.56 → 1096.20] That's the one
[1096.20 → 1097.00] spiritual practice
[1097.00 → 1098.52] that Jude highlights.
[1099.06 → 1100.44] This doesn't excuse us
[1100.44 → 1101.44] to not practice
[1101.44 → 1103.00] any other spiritual practices.
[1103.40 → 1104.16] You don't want to fall
[1104.16 → 1105.90] into antinomian doctrine again,
[1106.42 → 1107.18] but prayer,
[1108.08 → 1110.24] prayer is very important
[1110.24 → 1111.66] as we continue
[1111.66 → 1112.52] our faith journeys.
[1113.24 → 1114.02] And then lastly,
[1114.20 → 1115.08] in verse 21,
[1116.04 → 1116.62] Jude says,
[1117.06 → 1117.88] keep yourselves,
[1118.04 → 1118.80] all of you,
[1119.44 → 1121.04] together in God's love
[1121.04 → 1121.60] as you wait
[1121.60 → 1122.24] for the mercy
[1122.24 → 1123.52] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1123.52 → 1124.58] to bring you
[1124.58 → 1125.44] to eternal life.
[1126.16 → 1126.88] In other words,
[1127.28 → 1128.44] in all we do,
[1128.56 → 1129.34] in our doctrine
[1129.34 → 1130.18] and character,
[1130.62 → 1132.12] throughout our whole lives
[1132.12 → 1133.60] as disciples of Jesus,
[1133.98 → 1135.24] we are to live
[1135.24 → 1136.88] out of the eternal hope,
[1137.08 → 1137.92] our foundation,
[1138.26 → 1139.28] our cornerstone,
[1139.70 → 1140.52] Jesus Christ,
[1140.52 → 1141.88] who will return
[1141.88 → 1143.76] and make all things
[1143.76 → 1144.30] new again.
[1145.30 → 1146.20] That's the story
[1146.20 → 1146.64] of the Bible
[1146.64 → 1147.90] that we belong to
[1147.90 → 1149.22] because ultimately,
[1149.56 → 1150.68] that's the hope
[1150.68 → 1152.10] that drives our faith.
[1152.80 → 1153.80] We are not a people
[1153.80 → 1155.40] that live without hope.
[1155.64 → 1157.00] We are always founded
[1157.00 → 1157.46] in hope,
[1157.54 → 1158.32] and we live
[1158.32 → 1159.64] with holy expectation
[1159.64 → 1160.94] as we wait,
[1161.48 → 1163.04] we wait for the Lord
[1163.04 → 1164.02] to make all things
[1164.02 → 1164.54] right again.
[1165.30 → 1166.66] And it's just so fitting,
[1166.80 → 1167.04] right?
[1167.28 → 1168.18] Can you believe it?
[1168.28 → 1169.84] Next week is already Advent,
[1170.72 → 1170.86] right?
[1170.92 → 1171.78] December 1st,
[1171.88 → 1173.00] start of Advent already.
[1173.44 → 1174.46] Get your Christmas trees out
[1174.46 → 1176.32] if you haven't gotten it out already.
[1176.66 → 1177.90] Listen to Christian songs,
[1178.12 → 1179.16] and that's the season
[1179.16 → 1180.12] that we're getting into.
[1180.82 → 1181.20] Hopefully,
[1181.32 → 1182.60] minus all the consumer stuff
[1182.60 → 1183.50] that we have to deal with
[1183.50 → 1184.20] and battle with.
[1185.58 → 1186.64] But Advent
[1186.64 → 1188.14] simply means
[1188.14 → 1189.14] holy waiting,
[1190.08 → 1190.32] right?
[1190.40 → 1191.22] We are a people
[1191.22 → 1193.20] who have our eternal hope
[1193.20 → 1194.22] in Jesus Christ.
[1195.04 → 1196.06] So in our joys,
[1196.16 → 1196.68] we celebrate
[1196.68 → 1197.76] the goodness of God.
[1198.02 → 1199.14] And in our suffering,
[1199.38 → 1200.34] we find refuge
[1200.34 → 1201.10] and comfort
[1201.10 → 1202.24] because we belong
[1202.24 → 1203.50] to this story of hope.
[1206.92 → 1208.08] And I want to end
[1208.08 → 1209.42] our series on Jude today
[1209.42 → 1210.02] with a word
[1210.02 → 1210.64] for the leaders
[1210.64 → 1211.68] of our church, actually.
[1212.30 → 1213.08] Whether it's
[1213.08 → 1214.42] in an official,
[1214.74 → 1215.66] ordained capacity
[1215.66 → 1216.30] like our elders
[1216.30 → 1216.90] or deacons,
[1217.18 → 1218.12] or whether it's
[1218.12 → 1219.04] ministry leadership,
[1219.46 → 1220.10] small groups,
[1220.22 → 1220.84] friends groups,
[1221.80 → 1222.72] whatever way,
[1223.34 → 1224.32] we all play
[1224.32 → 1225.56] we can all play
[1225.56 → 1226.70] leadership for one another
[1226.70 → 1227.40] as we support
[1227.40 → 1227.90] one another.
[1228.78 → 1229.78] So for leaders,
[1230.82 → 1231.56] and remember
[1231.56 → 1232.16] that image
[1232.16 → 1233.00] of that herd
[1233.00 → 1233.78] that I started
[1233.78 → 1234.56] this sermon with,
[1234.94 → 1235.16] right,
[1235.18 → 1235.80] where we keep
[1235.80 → 1236.30] the vulnerable
[1236.30 → 1237.16] and weak in the middle
[1237.16 → 1238.42] and the stronger ones
[1238.42 → 1239.08] on the outside?
[1240.52 → 1241.70] This is kind of similar
[1241.70 → 1243.00] to what Paul says
[1243.00 → 1244.26] in 1 Corinthians 13,
[1244.70 → 1246.86] and we call this
[1246.86 → 1247.66] the love chapter.
[1248.94 → 1249.74] Paul says,
[1249.74 → 1251.80] love always protects.
[1253.12 → 1253.98] That's leadership.
[1254.88 → 1256.56] Love always protects,
[1256.88 → 1257.74] always trusts,
[1258.06 → 1258.88] always hopes,
[1259.20 → 1260.50] and always perseveres.
[1262.08 → 1262.78] To me,
[1262.84 → 1263.44] that's the image
[1263.44 → 1265.40] of what Christ-like leaders do,
[1265.94 → 1266.76] loving one another
[1266.76 → 1267.40] in this way.
[1268.32 → 1269.26] And just like so,
[1269.38 → 1270.62] Jude encourages us
[1270.62 → 1272.50] in the concluding verses
[1272.50 → 1274.04] to show mercy
[1274.04 → 1274.76] for one another,
[1275.12 → 1276.38] to love one another
[1276.38 → 1276.98] in this way,
[1276.98 → 1278.56] especially to those
[1278.56 → 1279.20] who are what?
[1280.16 → 1280.68] Doubting.
[1281.14 → 1282.06] Those who are weak
[1282.06 → 1282.78] and vulnerable.
[1283.16 → 1284.10] Bring them to the middle.
[1284.86 → 1285.84] Protect them
[1285.84 → 1286.80] with the love
[1286.80 → 1288.32] that we receive
[1288.32 → 1288.94] from the Father.
[1290.20 → 1290.72] Again,
[1290.82 → 1291.60] from 1 Corinthians
[1291.60 → 1292.50] in verse 4.
[1293.24 → 1294.48] Loving like the Father does.
[1294.70 → 1295.72] What does that look like?
[1296.32 → 1297.22] With patience
[1297.22 → 1298.12] and kindness.
[1299.12 → 1299.80] With love
[1299.80 → 1300.80] that does not
[1300.80 → 1302.30] envy or boast,
[1302.84 → 1304.38] that is not proud.
[1305.60 → 1306.24] There again,
[1306.24 → 1307.32] that humility piece.
[1308.72 → 1309.82] With humility,
[1310.08 → 1311.22] we build each other up.
[1311.26 → 1312.22] And then Paul goes on.
[1312.68 → 1313.40] With love
[1313.40 → 1315.08] that does not
[1315.08 → 1316.36] delight in evil,
[1316.76 → 1317.96] but rejoices
[1317.96 → 1318.76] with the truth.
[1319.50 → 1320.44] And then there's
[1320.44 → 1321.24] that truth element,
[1321.48 → 1322.56] that doctrine element.
[1323.16 → 1323.30] Right?
[1324.48 → 1325.66] Jude says the same thing.
[1326.32 → 1327.48] To others show mercy
[1327.48 → 1328.52] mixed with fear,
[1328.80 → 1330.08] hating even the clothing
[1330.08 → 1331.82] stained by corrupted flesh.
[1332.16 → 1333.78] And I put the New Living Translation
[1333.78 → 1334.86] so that it connects better.
[1334.86 → 1336.30] This is a translation
[1336.30 → 1337.00] that reads,
[1337.42 → 1338.04] show mercy
[1338.04 → 1339.06] to still others,
[1339.28 → 1340.58] but do so
[1340.58 → 1341.74] with great caution,
[1342.30 → 1343.32] hating the sins
[1343.32 → 1344.26] that contaminate
[1344.26 → 1344.92] their lives.
[1347.08 → 1347.68] Yes,
[1348.08 → 1348.86] Christlike leader
[1348.86 → 1349.38] is loving
[1349.38 → 1350.28] the church community
[1350.28 → 1350.84] to life,
[1350.94 → 1352.14] but doing so
[1352.14 → 1353.68] with great caution,
[1353.88 → 1355.12] because being honest
[1355.12 → 1355.72] and humble
[1355.72 → 1357.70] means that you know
[1357.70 → 1360.02] you are not immune
[1360.02 → 1361.02] to temptations
[1361.02 → 1362.04] and brokenness
[1362.04 → 1362.52] and sins
[1362.52 → 1364.04] just because you are
[1364.04 → 1364.48] a leader.
[1366.08 → 1367.48] It's about being aware
[1367.48 → 1368.22] of the temptations
[1368.22 → 1369.40] that challenge us
[1369.40 → 1371.46] as we try to carry
[1371.46 → 1372.32] each other's burdens
[1372.32 → 1372.96] and struggles,
[1373.16 → 1374.28] to build one another
[1374.28 → 1375.02] up in love,
[1375.12 → 1376.16] but knowing that
[1376.16 → 1377.60] not any one of us
[1377.60 → 1378.60] has it perfect,
[1379.12 → 1379.96] that just because
[1379.96 → 1380.68] you're a pastor
[1380.68 → 1381.18] or elder
[1381.18 → 1381.74] or deacon,
[1382.10 → 1382.70] ministry leader
[1382.70 → 1383.28] or a teacher,
[1384.08 → 1385.34] it doesn't make you
[1385.34 → 1385.84] an exception
[1385.84 → 1386.60] from the attacks
[1386.60 → 1387.14] of the enemy.
[1387.14 → 1389.48] I would further
[1389.48 → 1390.54] suggest actually
[1390.54 → 1391.46] that the enemy
[1391.46 → 1392.72] loves to attack
[1392.72 → 1393.90] leaders even more
[1393.90 → 1396.70] because the enemy
[1396.70 → 1398.10] wants to use leaders
[1398.10 → 1399.54] to lead many more
[1399.54 → 1401.24] astray with the leader.
[1402.34 → 1403.16] So that's why
[1403.16 → 1403.82] it's so important
[1403.82 → 1405.20] to pray for our leaders.
[1409.12 → 1410.24] Allow me to end
[1410.24 → 1411.20] with this short reflection.
[1411.44 → 1412.16] This is something
[1412.16 → 1412.72] that I watched
[1412.72 → 1413.60] from a Korean drama.
[1414.60 → 1415.40] It's one of the most
[1415.40 → 1416.22] impactful scenes,
[1416.22 → 1416.94] at least to me.
[1417.78 → 1418.74] So it's a scene
[1418.74 → 1420.06] where the eldest
[1420.06 → 1421.06] of the family,
[1421.54 → 1421.70] right,
[1421.76 → 1422.90] the leader of the family
[1422.90 → 1425.58] is grieving
[1425.58 → 1426.98] at his mother's passing
[1426.98 → 1427.96] at a funeral.
[1428.82 → 1429.80] But it's meant
[1429.80 → 1430.54] to show that
[1430.54 → 1431.70] this eldest son
[1431.70 → 1433.40] shows the strength
[1433.40 → 1433.90] of a leader,
[1434.16 → 1435.50] that he holds it together
[1435.50 → 1436.40] and he's not supposed
[1436.40 → 1437.38] to show his emotions
[1437.38 → 1438.92] otherwise everyone else
[1438.92 → 1439.72] gets too sad
[1439.72 → 1440.94] and, you know, gloomy.
[1441.30 → 1442.72] So he stays strong.
[1442.92 → 1443.56] He's the leader
[1443.56 → 1444.40] of the family, right?
[1444.66 → 1445.38] He laughs,
[1445.52 → 1446.02] he drinks,
[1446.02 → 1446.82] he seems to be
[1446.82 → 1447.92] having a great time
[1447.92 → 1449.20] at his mother's funeral.
[1450.52 → 1452.12] The kids of this eldest son
[1452.12 → 1453.70] are even confused
[1453.70 → 1454.80] of why their dad
[1454.80 → 1455.46] is so happy.
[1455.80 → 1456.68] Like, is he crazy?
[1457.02 → 1457.80] Did he lose it?
[1458.18 → 1458.94] Like, his mom
[1458.94 → 1459.78] just passed away.
[1459.96 → 1460.94] Why is he so happy?
[1462.70 → 1463.80] And then it's
[1463.80 → 1464.86] right up to the point
[1464.86 → 1466.70] when the actual
[1466.70 → 1468.00] oldest of the family,
[1468.16 → 1468.98] the older sister,
[1469.52 → 1470.58] comes and joins
[1470.58 → 1471.22] the funeral.
[1471.22 → 1471.28] funeral.
[1471.92 → 1473.44] And we see the image
[1473.44 → 1474.76] of this eldest son
[1474.76 → 1476.64] finally breaking down
[1476.64 → 1477.24] in tears,
[1477.66 → 1478.90] bursting out with emotions
[1478.90 → 1479.70] that he's been trying
[1479.70 → 1480.46] to hold back
[1480.46 → 1481.26] as the leader
[1481.26 → 1481.84] of the family.
[1482.24 → 1482.56] Why?
[1483.24 → 1484.22] Because he finally
[1484.22 → 1484.78] has somebody
[1484.78 → 1485.72] he can lean on.
[1487.00 → 1488.52] Somebody he can depend on
[1488.52 → 1489.42] has finally showed up
[1489.42 → 1489.90] to the funeral.
[1490.16 → 1491.02] Now he doesn't have
[1491.02 → 1491.70] to hold it in
[1491.70 → 1492.18] any longer.
[1492.18 → 1495.60] In the same way,
[1496.10 → 1497.20] we all need
[1497.20 → 1498.22] this kind of support.
[1498.66 → 1499.82] And we all need
[1499.82 → 1500.30] each other.
[1501.28 → 1501.96] Our leaders
[1501.96 → 1503.54] need all of us too.
[1505.00 → 1506.34] And this is exactly
[1506.34 → 1507.72] why God calls us
[1507.72 → 1508.44] as a people.
[1509.04 → 1509.80] And it's exactly
[1509.80 → 1510.96] why it's you all,
[1511.06 → 1512.24] not just you singular.
[1512.62 → 1513.46] It's not just
[1513.46 → 1515.04] individual saved souls
[1515.04 → 1516.26] who happen to gather
[1516.26 → 1516.84] once a week
[1516.84 → 1517.32] on a Sunday
[1517.32 → 1517.96] in this building.
[1518.88 → 1520.00] We are a family
[1520.00 → 1520.46] of God
[1520.46 → 1521.20] that is called
[1521.20 → 1522.18] as the people
[1522.18 → 1523.10] of God together
[1523.10 → 1524.62] to build one another
[1524.62 → 1525.60] up in our most
[1525.60 → 1526.38] holy faith.
[1526.88 → 1528.00] Founded on our
[1528.00 → 1528.88] ultimate shepherd
[1528.88 → 1529.32] and Lord
[1529.32 → 1530.56] who is Jesus Christ.
[1531.48 → 1532.86] That is our calling.
[1534.00 → 1535.16] And so as we trust
[1535.16 → 1536.06] more and more
[1536.06 → 1538.64] into this calling
[1538.64 → 1539.12] of ours,
[1539.22 → 1540.40] into God's leading
[1540.40 → 1541.28] in our lives,
[1541.78 → 1543.66] may God equip us
[1543.66 → 1544.86] to be a blessing
[1544.86 → 1545.60] for others,
[1546.00 → 1547.26] blessing for one another.
[1547.52 → 1548.66] And may this blessing
[1548.66 → 1549.38] overflow
[1549.38 → 1551.08] for our community
[1551.08 → 1552.00] and for our neighbours.
[1552.40 → 1553.38] And they may see
[1553.38 → 1554.06] and glimpse
[1554.06 → 1555.46] the kingdom of God
[1555.46 → 1556.46] that's reflected
[1556.46 → 1557.82] in our love
[1557.82 → 1558.58] for one another.
[1559.84 → 1560.40] Amen.
[1561.66 → 1562.42] Let's pray.
[1568.86 → 1569.74] Loving Father,
[1570.62 → 1572.94] we come before you
[1572.94 → 1573.66] in humility
[1573.66 → 1575.34] and trust,
[1575.74 → 1575.94] Lord,
[1575.94 → 1578.34] that you are our shepherd
[1578.34 → 1580.68] and that you are able
[1580.68 → 1582.40] and that you lead us
[1582.40 → 1583.60] through all the ups
[1583.60 → 1584.24] and downs,
[1584.76 → 1585.34] the mountains
[1585.34 → 1586.30] and the valleys
[1586.30 → 1588.28] throughout our faith journeys.
[1589.56 → 1590.50] We thank you
[1590.50 → 1591.50] for this good news
[1591.50 → 1592.40] that we are
[1592.40 → 1593.64] in your hands
[1593.64 → 1595.20] and that we can trust
[1595.20 → 1595.72] in you.
[1596.96 → 1598.26] I'm also thankful
[1598.26 → 1599.72] for my brothers
[1599.72 → 1600.32] and sisters
[1600.32 → 1601.38] here at our church
[1601.38 → 1603.08] that we get to pray
[1603.08 → 1603.82] for one another
[1603.82 → 1605.78] when we're sick
[1605.78 → 1606.98] or when we're joyful.
[1607.50 → 1608.54] We get to do
[1608.54 → 1609.54] all this together
[1609.54 → 1610.30] as a family.
[1611.48 → 1612.62] I pray, Lord,
[1613.16 → 1614.18] out of confession,
[1615.96 → 1616.44] forgive us
[1616.44 → 1616.98] for the times
[1616.98 → 1618.02] where we fail
[1618.02 → 1618.96] to reflect
[1618.96 → 1619.86] this family love
[1619.86 → 1620.50] for one another.
[1621.92 → 1622.32] And Lord,
[1622.40 → 1623.62] I pray that you continue
[1623.62 → 1624.22] to deepen
[1624.22 → 1625.14] the relationships
[1625.14 → 1626.50] that are forming
[1626.50 → 1627.76] here within our church,
[1628.40 → 1630.04] that you would bear
[1630.04 → 1630.72] good fruit
[1630.72 → 1631.96] out of these relationships,
[1631.96 → 1633.32] that we would be able
[1633.32 → 1633.96] to encourage
[1633.96 → 1635.20] and support one another
[1635.20 → 1637.02] to build one another up
[1637.02 → 1638.14] in our faith journeys,
[1638.34 → 1639.94] to stand firm,
[1640.06 → 1640.78] to contend
[1640.78 → 1641.78] for our faith
[1641.78 → 1642.62] in doctrine
[1642.62 → 1643.92] and our character
[1643.92 → 1645.62] as we live,
[1646.22 → 1647.20] as we strive,
[1647.56 → 1648.38] as we struggle
[1648.38 → 1649.76] to be real disciples
[1649.76 → 1650.38] of yours.
[1651.86 → 1652.74] Help us
[1652.74 → 1653.84] in our weakness, Lord.
[1654.68 → 1655.42] Guide us
[1655.42 → 1656.38] continually.
[1657.88 → 1658.30] And Lord,
[1658.40 → 1659.28] may we continue
[1659.28 → 1659.86] to pray
[1659.86 → 1661.50] as you will hear
[1661.50 → 1662.18] our prayers.
[1663.98 → 1665.18] We thank you again
[1665.18 → 1666.18] for this time, Lord.
[1666.18 → 1666.52] Thank you.
[1666.52 → 1667.18] Thank you.
[1667.18 → 1667.24] Thank you.
