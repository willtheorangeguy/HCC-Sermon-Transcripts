[2729.60 → 2759.60] Thank you.
[2759.60 → 2789.60] He's God.
[2789.60 → 2819.60] Thank you.
[2819.60 → 2849.60] Thank you.
[2849.60 → 2879.60] Thank you.
[2879.60 → 2880.60] Thank you.
[2909.60 → 2910.60] Thank you.
[2939.60 → 2969.60] Thank you.
[2969.60 → 2970.60] Thank you.
[2999.64 → 3000.60] you.
[3000.60 → 3005.32] are with you to share life, to share companionship. And some of you know that all too well as you get
[3005.32 → 3011.48] around the Christmas table and there's somebody missing because they have passed away. Paul,
[3011.66 → 3020.32] in the face of a brutal, violent world full of death, says, there is one person who overcame death.
[3021.04 → 3026.40] And here's the important word, firstborn. When I say that I have a firstborn child, what does that
[3026.40 → 3034.18] imply? It implies I have more kids, doesn't it? Right? I don't say firstborn. And the reason Paul
[3034.18 → 3039.52] uses this language, and we see this elsewhere, is because the point and the purpose of Jesus rising
[3039.52 → 3045.04] from the dead was not just a trick to show how much power he had. The reason for it was that those who
[3045.04 → 3054.02] follow him by faith also rise from the dead because they follow a resurrected king. It's at this point
[3054.02 → 3061.34] that you can say amen, by the way. You got this. If you were to visit, and you still can do this,
[3061.76 → 3068.06] a cemetery in different parts of Europe, you would see on many tombstones a statement in Latin that
[3068.06 → 3075.04] says resurged. Anyone know what that means? It's a Latin word that says quite defiantly, I might add,
[3075.04 → 3084.04] I shall rise. And many Christians throughout history have said, what's the thing I want on my tombstone?
[3084.24 → 3088.80] Well, I follow Jesus, and so the word on my tombstone will be resurged, because by faith,
[3089.00 → 3094.18] I share in the resurrection life of Jesus, who not only brings renewal and life to me now,
[3094.78 → 3100.30] but raises my body back from death after I die. Praise the Lord.
[3100.30 → 3109.40] Now I want to get to the part that gets even more controversial, you might say, because Paul says
[3109.40 → 3113.40] he's the firstborn of creation. He's the firstborn among the dead. And what's his next line?
[3114.28 → 3123.20] So that in all things, Jesus will have the supremacy. You have to remember, Paul's writing this at a time
[3123.20 → 3130.24] where people all kind of knew who had the supremacy. He kind of sat on a throne. He was known as the
[3130.24 → 3134.82] Caesar people. We're worshipping him and burning incense in his name. And Paul's got the guts to be
[3134.82 → 3141.30] like, in all things, the firstborn of creation, the firstborn among the dead, Jesus Christ must have
[3141.30 → 3150.42] supremacy. And in my opinion, Paul gets in our business with this passage, because he knows then,
[3150.42 → 3157.76] just like now, people will organize their lives around something or someone. And many people in
[3157.76 → 3162.52] Roman cities, they place their hope, they place their trust, they place their love and affection
[3162.52 → 3169.18] on this Caesar. Many people worshipped him as a God. And Paul says, he's not someone who will triumph
[3169.18 → 3173.76] over the grave. He will live, and he will die, but there is someone who has supremacy, who has defeated
[3173.76 → 3179.60] death, and that is Jesus. But for us, maybe some of us put our hope in a political leader. I certainly
[3179.60 → 3183.50] hope not. These are not easy days to put hope in political leaders. I'm not going to get all political,
[3183.50 → 3186.78] but I think you can agree with me on that. It doesn't matter where you live in the world.
[3187.44 → 3193.82] But we organize our life around something for meaning, purpose, for joy. Perhaps it's some
[3193.82 → 3200.14] accomplishment at work that you hope gives you your legacy. Perhaps it's the favour of those around you.
[3200.28 → 3205.66] Perhaps it's a certain level of influence on Instagram or certain wealth by the end of your life.
[3206.46 → 3211.78] And Paul says, in all things, Christ must have supremacy. And all other created things,
[3211.78 → 3216.10] even though they are good, like world leaders and relationships and our work,
[3216.46 → 3221.52] they cannot be the centre that gives meaning, purpose, and significance to our lives.
[3221.88 → 3229.98] The child who comes in fragility in the moment of Christmas is also the risen Lord who claims
[3229.98 → 3237.46] supremacy over all of our lives after his resurrection. But now I want to finish with where the poem finishes.
[3237.46 → 3241.16] And it really gets more at the why of Christmas.
[3242.46 → 3252.44] For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself
[3252.44 → 3260.04] all things, whether things on earth or in heaven, by making peace through his bloodshed on the cross.
[3260.04 → 3264.28] If you don't already know this, I will say this as clearly as possible.
[3264.62 → 3271.60] The goal of God in sending Jesus was to bring healing to the whole creation.
[3272.40 → 3277.78] If you didn't notice this, a repeated phrase throughout this whole passage is all things.
[3278.62 → 3281.78] Not just certain individuals, but the whole of creation.
[3282.26 → 3288.94] And then, yes, healing and forgiveness to a world that is corrupted by sin and lives in rebellion and rejection to God.
[3288.94 → 3290.56] God came for us also.
[3290.78 → 3295.76] And then also to overcome the finality and the brutality of death itself.
[3297.06 → 3302.54] And the reason we worship today is that we believe that God did what God sent Jesus to do.
[3303.50 → 3304.84] The grave is empty.
[3306.30 → 3307.34] Forgiveness has come.
[3308.40 → 3309.42] Death has been defeated.
[3309.68 → 3313.78] And Jesus is exalted at the right hand of God.
[3314.50 → 3315.38] Praise the Lord.
[3315.38 → 3320.66] And so I'm going to finish with some poetry by Charles Wesley.
[3321.82 → 3323.82] Words that we will sing in just a minute.
[3324.26 → 3326.86] In fact, as I read it, I'll invite the worship team up on the stage.
[3327.20 → 3331.26] But this is the third verse to Hark the Herald Angels Sing.
[3331.26 → 3361.24] Hark the Herald Angels Sing.
[3361.26 → 3362.68] Herald Angels Sing.
[3362.68 → 3366.30] Glory to the newborn King.
[3367.30 → 3367.90] Amen.
[3368.62 → 3370.88] Let's stand and sing to this King.
[3370.88 → 3372.00] Amen.
[3378.52 → 3380.46] Amen.
[3380.46 → 3380.80] Amen.
[3382.02 → 3382.16] Amen.
[3382.16 → 3382.24] Amen.
[3382.24 → 3382.52] Amen.
[3382.52 → 3382.92] Amen.
[3382.92 → 3383.84] Amen.
[3383.84 → 3384.28] Amen.
[3384.28 → 3388.32] Amen.
[3397.12 → 3398.28] Amen.
[3398.28 → 3398.56] Amen.
[3398.56 → 3408.50] Let the herald angels sing
[3408.50 → 3412.74] Glory to the newborn King
[3412.74 → 3417.10] Peace on earth and mercy mild
[3417.10 → 3421.30] God and sinners reconciled
[3421.30 → 3425.68] Joyful all ye nations ride
[3425.68 → 3429.84] Join the triumph of the sky
[3429.84 → 3433.84] With angelic calls proclaim
[3433.84 → 3437.68] Christ is born in Bethlehem
[3438.34 → 3442.50] Hark the herald angels sing
[3442.50 → 3446.68] Glory to the newborn King
[3447.54 → 3453.68] Christ by highest heaven adore
[3453.68 → 3457.68] Christ the everlasting Lord
[3458.48 → 3462.84] Mid in time behold Him come
[3462.84 → 3466.88] O offspring of the virgin day
[3466.88 → 3470.68] Hail in flesh the Godhead see
[3471.20 → 3474.68] Hail the incarnate deity
[3474.68 → 3479.58] Please as men with us to dwell
[3479.58 → 3483.28] Jesus our Emmanuel
[3483.28 → 3488.08] Hark the herald angels sing
[3488.08 → 3492.68] Glory to the newborn King
[3492.68 → 3499.68] Hail the heaven Prince of Peace
[3499.68 → 3503.84] Hail the song of righteousness
[3503.84 → 3507.88] Life and life to all He brings
[3507.88 → 3511.84] Risen when He leads me
[3511.84 → 3516.84] While He lays His glory by
[3516.84 → 3521.00] Born that when no more may die
[3521.00 → 3525.08] Born to raise the sons of earth
[3525.08 → 3528.84] Born to give them second birth
[3528.84 → 3533.00] Hark the herald angels sing
[3533.00 → 3538.40] Glory to the newborn King
[3538.40 → 3552.54] Glory to the newborn King
[3552.54 → 3555.48] Well friends this is the part of our service where we get to light our Christ candles
[3555.48 → 3558.48] And I'll ask that we bring the house lights down for this
[3558.48 → 3564.48] If you did not grab a candle on your way in there should be some in the foyer
[3564.48 → 3570.04] And the only request that our custodian has made is we try not to burn the building down
[3570.04 → 3572.12] We've had some close calls in the past
[3572.12 → 3577.42] But this is the image that we have that Christ Himself gives us
[3577.42 → 3581.54] In John chapter 8 Jesus has the boldness to say
[3581.54 → 3585.52] I am the light of the world
[3585.52 → 3589.60] That lights up into the darkness and brings healing
[3589.60 → 3594.30] But also in Matthew 5 Jesus says to those who follow Him and will believe in Him
[3594.30 → 3597.50] You are the light of the world
[3597.50 → 3599.44] And so we light these candles
[3599.44 → 3602.54] I'm going to light my candle in a moment from the Christ candle
[3602.54 → 3603.68] And then I'm going to go to the front
[3603.68 → 3605.96] And light some of the candles of those in the front
[3605.96 → 3609.32] And if you could just be so kind as to sort of turn behind to those behind you
[3609.32 → 3610.14] And light their candles
[3610.14 → 3613.24] And as we do that we are going to sing O Holy Night
[3613.24 → 3615.94] And as I already mentioned this is another song
[3615.94 → 3618.10] That has been banned through the years
[3618.10 → 3619.62] Because it was so controversial
[3619.62 → 3622.56] And it was poetry that challenged oppression
[3622.56 → 3625.32] Because Jesus Christ is our Prince of Peace
[3625.32 → 3627.94] So let's light our candles from the Christ candle
[3627.94 → 3629.88] And we'll sing together O Holy Night
[3629.88 → 3642.14] O Holy Night
[3642.14 → 3647.24] The stars are brightly shining
[3647.24 → 3654.74] It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
[3654.74 → 3666.58] Long lay the world in sin and ever pining
[3666.58 → 3674.68] Till He appeared, and the soul felt its worth
[3674.68 → 3679.96] A thrill of hope
[3679.96 → 3684.68] The weary world rejoices
[3684.68 → 3687.78] For yonder breaks
[3687.78 → 3693.72] A new and glorious Lord
[3693.72 → 3701.34] Far on your knees
[3701.34 → 3708.92] O hear the angel's voices
[3708.92 → 3714.02] O night divine
[3714.02 → 3715.92] O night divine
[3715.92 → 3725.78] O night when Christ was born
[3725.78 → 3732.92] O night divine
[3732.92 → 3738.02] O night and night divine
[3738.02 → 3739.92] O night divine
[3739.92 → 3741.92] O night divine
[3741.92 → 3742.02] O night divine
[3742.02 → 3742.92] O night divine
[3742.92 → 3746.92] Truly He taught us to love one another
[3746.92 → 3750.92] Truly He taught us to love one another
[3750.92 → 3751.92] Love one another
[3751.92 → 3757.92] Is not His love
[3757.92 → 3763.92] And His gospel is peace
[3763.92 → 3765.90] Do you please
[3765.90 → 3766.92] He prayed and His love
[3766.92 → 3767.92] O Lord
[3767.92 → 3768.92] O night divine
[3768.92 → 3769.92] Nam
[3769.92 → 3782.86] Lord
[3782.86 → 3785.92] He prayed and His?
[3785.92 → 3786.92] � Tull
[3786.92 → 3788.50] of joy
[3788.50 → 3790.60] in grateful
[3790.60 → 3793.04] chorus raise
[3793.04 → 3795.26] we that all
[3795.26 → 3796.42] within
[3796.42 → 3799.12] as praise
[3799.12 → 3800.92] his holy name
[3801.96 → 3804.92] Christ
[3805.82 → 3806.96] is the
[3806.96 → 3808.92] Lord
[3808.92 → 3810.92] O praise
[3811.76 → 3814.88] his name
[3814.88 → 3815.40] for
[3815.40 → 3817.40] ever
[3817.40 → 3819.50] his
[3819.50 → 3821.40] love
[3823.02 → 3823.40] and
[3823.82 → 3825.40] glory
[3827.24 → 3829.40] ever
[3829.40 → 3831.40] more
[3832.16 → 3833.40] proclaim
[3833.40 → 3835.40] his
[3836.76 → 3837.40] love
[3839.52 → 3840.90] and
[3840.90 → 3843.40] glory
[3843.40 → 3845.40] evermore
[3845.40 → 3849.40] proclaim
[3849.40 → 3853.40] Christ
[3853.40 → 3859.40] is the Lord
[3859.40 → 3861.40] Lord
[3861.40 → 3863.40] O praise
[3863.40 → 3865.40] his name
[3865.40 → 3867.40] forever
[3867.40 → 3869.40] his

[3871.40 → 3875.40] and glory
[3875.40 → 3877.40] ever

[3891.40 → 3893.40] evermore

[3895.40 → 3897.40] glory
[3897.40 → 3899.40] and
[3899.40 → 3901.40] glory
[3901.40 → 3903.40] ever
[3903.40 → 3905.40] proclaim
[3905.40 → 3907.40] glory
[3907.40 → 3909.40] and
[3909.40 → 3911.40] glory
[3911.40 → 3913.40] amen
[3913.40 → 3915.40] to

[3917.40 → 3919.40] glory
[3919.40 → 3921.40] and
[3921.40 → 3923.40] glory

[3931.40 → 3933.40] and
[3933.40 → 3935.40] glory
[3935.40 → 3952.94] Bar
[3953.40 → 3954.92] to
[3954.92 → 3957.16] Lecture
[3957.40 → 3961.40] n
[3961.40 → 3963.68] Finally, let me say this as words of sending.
[3964.56 → 3968.06] The way Jesus shines his light in the world
[3968.06 → 3970.16] is through the church.
[3971.04 → 3973.72] It is through your ordinary acts of love,
[3974.62 → 3978.78] of generosity, of sacrifice and justice
[3978.78 → 3981.30] in your family over Christmas,
[3981.64 → 3983.60] in your workplace when you go back,
[3983.88 → 3984.76] in your neighbourhood.
[3985.10 → 3987.12] That is how the light of Christ shines.
[3987.28 → 3991.06] And so we are sent to bear witness with our little lights
[3991.06 → 3993.72] to Jesus Christ, the light of the world.
[3994.66 → 3996.10] And so receive his blessing.
[3997.54 → 3999.14] Go in the love of God.
[4000.24 → 4002.98] Go in the grace of Jesus Christ, his son,
[4003.12 → 4004.78] who has rescued us by the cross.
[4005.26 → 4009.24] And go in the power and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
[4009.94 → 4010.28] Amen.
[4011.40 → 4014.50] Now I've got a request that came after the 4 p.m. service.
[4015.18 → 4016.80] Is there any chance we could sing
[4016.80 → 4019.10] Go Tell It on the Mountain one more time?
[4019.10 → 4022.76] Does that sound favourable to our worship team?
[4023.54 → 4024.82] And to our media people?
[4024.88 → 4025.90] Is that something we want to do?
[4026.50 → 4027.76] Okay, let's sing it together.
[4027.98 → 4029.84] And you can also, after we sing,
[4029.92 → 4030.88] you can blow out your candles
[4030.88 → 4031.84] and there are little basins.
[4031.94 → 4034.16] You can put the finished off candlesticks
[4034.16 → 4034.90] on your way out.
[4034.98 → 4035.60] Go in peace.
[4035.60 → 4055.04] Go tell it on the mountain
[4055.04 → 4058.92] Over the hills and everywhere
[4058.92 → 4062.36] Go tell it on the mountain
[4062.36 → 4066.10] That Jesus Christ is born
[4066.10 → 4069.80] While shepherds kept their watching
[4069.80 → 4073.62] O'er silent thoughts by night
[4073.62 → 4077.38] Behold, throughout the heavens
[4077.38 → 4081.04] There showed a holy light
[4081.04 → 4086.36] Go tell it on the mountain
[4086.36 → 4090.26] Over the hills and everywhere
[4090.26 → 4093.86] Go tell it on the mountain
[4093.86 → 4097.32] That Jesus Christ is born
[4097.32 → 4101.32] The shepherds leered and trembled
[4101.32 → 4104.94] When low above the earth
[4104.94 → 4108.86] Play out the angel chorus
[4108.86 → 4112.48] That hailed the Saviour's birth
[4112.48 → 4117.80] Oh tell it on the mountain
[4117.80 → 4121.70] Over the hills and everywhere
[4121.70 → 4125.22] Go tell it on the mountain
[4125.22 → 4128.86] That Jesus Christ is born
[4128.86 → 4131.86] Down in a lonely manger
[4132.48 → 4136.30] The humble Christ was born
[4136.30 → 4139.80] And God sent us salvation
[4139.80 → 4143.92] That blessed Christmas was born
[4143.92 → 4149.34] Go tell it on the mountain
[4149.34 → 4153.24] Over the hills and everywhere
[4153.24 → 4156.76] Go tell it on the mountain
[4156.76 → 4159.76] Sing it one more time
[4159.76 → 4161.14] Go tell it on the mountain
[4161.14 → 4164.14] Go tell it on the mountain
[4164.14 → 4168.04] Over the hills and everywhere
[4168.04 → 4171.56] Go tell it on the mountain
[4171.56 → 4174.14] That Jesus Christ is born
[4174.14 → 4178.42] That Jesus Christ is born
[4178.42 → 4184.08] That Jesus Christ is born
[4184.08 → 4188.42] Amen
[4188.42 → 4189.68] Go in peace
[4189.68 → 4190.48] Merry Christmas
