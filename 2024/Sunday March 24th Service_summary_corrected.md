• Reflection on facing temptations of the world (1 John chapter 2)
• Normalized sin in culture: example given from Korean culture around drinking
• Definition of "the world" in biblical context: a system of ideas and values that are institutionalized in corrupted cultures
• Warning against loving or being drawn into these normalized patterns of sin
• Sinful nature and disordered desires lead to normalizing sin as acceptable
• The world replaces God as the ultimate source of truth, life, and happiness
• John's letter is a command not to love the world or anything in it
• Loving the world means having a total commitment and loyalty to something other than God
• Agape (total commitment and loyalty) to the world prevents agape for God
• You cannot serve two masters; either you will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other
• Jesus discusses the relationship between money and love
• Money is an aspect of the world that we are called to resist
• Agape, or unconditional love, is equated with serving and devoting oneself to one master
• Serving two masters is not possible, including God and money
• The passage from Ephesians 2 describes humanity's former state as dead in sin and following the ways of the world
• Humanity used to live according to the patterns of the world and serve it
• This service to the world was a form of rebellion against God and seeking autonomy from Him
• The struggle against human flesh and sinful nature
• The three roots of the world: lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life
• Lust as a perversion of love and true love (agape)
• Disordered desires and their impact on enslavement and addiction
• Pride of life as rebelling against authority and thinking one knows better than God
• Human tendency to follow the world and its ways
• Cultural lies that we live by, such as "follow your heart" and assuming our hearts are pure
• Connection made between the three roots of the world (lust of flesh, lust of eyes, pride of life) and Jesus' temptations in the wilderness
• The same temptations faced by Jesus apply to us, including being tempted by sinful natures and the world's influence

• The importance of God's will, good, pleasing, and perfect will in guiding Christian decision-making
• The speaker discusses the need for God's Spirit to guide and help people in their struggle against normalized sins in culture.
• The world and its desires are fleeting and do not satisfy deep longings for happiness and joy, which can only come from God.
• Doing God's will is what gives a life worth living and leads to eternal life.
• God satisfies deep longings and restores wholeness.
• Love for God, rather than the world, is the key to understanding God's will.
• Loving God as He first loved us allows our brokenness to be restored and overflow with love that blesses others.
• The importance of understanding one's identity in relation to the world
• Living in the world but not being part of it
• Reflecting God's love for the world and bringing about its restoration
• Being a witness to God's love through actions and behaviours
• Resisting patterns of the world and overcoming temptations with Jesus' power
• The role of Jesus Christ in winning battles against sin, self, and the world
• The struggle between good and evil, with God's sacrifice on behalf of humanity

• Belonging to God rather than loving the world
• Living in accordance with the gospel story as one's identity and calling
• Dependence on God's love and presence, not human strength or accomplishments
• Seeking God's will and good, rather than one's own desires or preferences
