[0.00 --> 6.24]  committed to sleep. You are committed. It is a gift to worship together, and this morning we get to
[6.24 --> 11.16]  finally close out our sermon series on being a contrast community, and we're going to focus
[11.16 --> 15.56]  actually on what it means to be community and our need for it. And you'll notice in the title that
[15.56 --> 21.52]  the title of this sermon is Being a Community Committed to One Another in a World of Isolation
[21.52 --> 27.20]  and Loneliness. And so if you have your Bible, turn with me to Hebrews chapter 10. I'm going to
[27.20 --> 32.90]  read encouragement and exhortation to a church that's struggling with actually people leaving
[32.90 --> 37.44]  the church in the book of Hebrews. So this is starting in verse 19, Hebrews 10.
[40.16 --> 46.98]  Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the
[46.98 --> 52.40]  blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened up for us through the curtain, that is his body,
[52.40 --> 59.98]  and since we have a great high priest over the house of God, let us draw near to God with sincere
[59.98 --> 65.66]  hearts in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from guilty conscience
[65.66 --> 73.66]  and having our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess for he
[73.66 --> 82.02]  who promised is faithful. And let us consider how we may spur one another on towards love and good deeds,
[82.02 --> 88.10]  not giving up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other daily,
[88.40 --> 93.48]  all the more as you see the day approaching. This is God's Word.
[97.58 --> 103.88]  Well, I want to begin with a story about a young man who visits his pastor's house unannounced one
[103.88 --> 108.84]  evening. The pastor sees him at the door and welcomes him, and the two of them sit together in front of the
[108.84 --> 115.12]  fire. And they then have this conversation where the young man shares his heart, that he feels
[115.12 --> 120.04]  disconnected from Christ, he feels disconnected from his church, and he feels cold in his faith.
[121.06 --> 124.92]  And as the conversation unfolds while the young man is sharing, the pastor stands up and he gets
[124.92 --> 131.44]  tongs from beside the fire, and he grabs a red ember from the fire, and he places it on the stone in front
[131.44 --> 136.98]  of the fire. And they continue the conversation, and then they notice as that little ember moves from red
[136.98 --> 143.56]  to gray to black. And then silently, really without saying anything, the pastor then grabs the tongs
[143.56 --> 149.28]  and puts that black ember back into the fire, and as they talk, they see it go from black to gray
[149.28 --> 155.62]  back to red. And without really saying much at all about the young man's story, the pastor was
[155.62 --> 161.12]  interacting very powerfully with what he was sharing. And what this pastor is trying to communicate is
[161.12 --> 168.02]  that that ember represented that young man himself, that disconnected from community, disconnected from
[168.02 --> 172.42]  the family of faith, leaves us cold, leaves us feeling isolated, leaves us feeling distant from
[172.42 --> 178.16]  Jesus himself. And that inside the community there is heat, there is warmth, there is the presence of
[178.16 --> 187.20]  the Spirit. You and I were created for community. You and I are designed to be in meaningful
[187.20 --> 192.74]  relationship. And it's not just a good idea, it's something we need. In Genesis 1, the creation
[192.74 --> 199.14]  account, there's only one thing mentioned that is not good. Do you know what it is? Adam being alone.
[200.60 --> 206.98]  Loneliness is a painful reality. We were created for community. Now here's one of the interesting
[206.98 --> 212.56]  ironies of the cultural moment you and I live in. Some 30 years ago, when the internet was still a baby,
[212.56 --> 217.84]  we were told that our technology and our devices and our smartphones and our Zoom meetings, we're
[217.84 --> 222.68]  going to build deeper relationships between people. We're going to be more connected than ever. We're
[222.68 --> 227.68]  going to be closer to each other, even across the world. And here we are some 35 years later after the
[227.68 --> 234.36]  internet was born, and we are most certainly not closer in relationship. In fact, there's a book by
[234.36 --> 240.06]  Sherry Turkle, and the name of the book is Alone Together. And that's how she describes Western society
[240.06 --> 243.94]  with our smartphones and our laptops and all the rest. We are together, but we are alone.
[244.86 --> 248.84]  I read this week an article, and this is an American statistic, but I'm sure it translates,
[249.76 --> 256.48]  that 36% to 40 of all Americans feel loneliness on a daily basis. And here's what's new about that
[256.48 --> 265.10]  stat. 61% of that number is young adults, and another 51% of that number is moms with young kids.
[265.10 --> 270.04]  And what's unique about this stat is they were saying usually in generations previous,
[270.18 --> 275.04]  the loneliness would be experienced among older people, right, who are a bit isolated, less mobility,
[275.30 --> 280.12]  and that was a reality. What's new about our society is that the loneliness is spiking among
[280.12 --> 284.76]  younger people, most notably young adults. And that for me is a red flag, like something is
[284.76 --> 290.00]  unraveling societally, something's not working in our communities, and we need to address it.
[290.00 --> 296.90]  You and I were created for community, and our society is reminding us of that as we try to find
[296.90 --> 302.74]  it through screens when we need it in real bodies and people. We say at every baptism at Hope, and
[302.74 --> 307.82]  maybe you've heard me say it, that we need a village to raise the child. Have you heard that phrase before?
[308.24 --> 312.34]  You say it almost every baptism. And I think what we need to hear this morning is that you and I
[312.34 --> 319.92]  need the village at every stage of life. Whether you're five years old, 15, 25, whether you're single,
[320.08 --> 329.56]  married, or senior, we need the village to flourish, to grow, to mature in Christ, and stay rooted in the
[329.56 --> 336.94]  gospel of Jesus. And that is what this passage is all about. Hebrews 10 is a fascinating passage. Here's why.
[336.94 --> 342.54]  It's a story, really, in the church of people leaving the church. But it's a very different kind
[342.54 --> 347.28]  of church, and the reasons for leaving are quite different than today. The church at the time of
[347.28 --> 352.54]  Hebrews was mostly just a small house church movement. They would have no such thing as a
[352.54 --> 356.74]  building like this with a larger gathering like this. They would be small groups of people meeting
[356.74 --> 362.86]  in homes. But the reality for them was pressure from the Roman society against the gospel of Jesus
[362.86 --> 369.26]  and pressure from the Jewish community from which many people converted into Christianity.
[370.16 --> 373.80]  And so they had family members saying, why you got to be part of this church? They had Roman society,
[373.80 --> 379.38]  which was increasing its persecution against the church. And you can imagine, in that circumstance,
[379.86 --> 386.42]  many believers saying, it's not worth it. It's not worth gathering with other believers. It puts
[386.42 --> 392.24]  tension in my family system. It puts tension in my Greek workplace. I'm just going to leave it alone.
[392.98 --> 401.46]  Keep my distance and play it safe. And can you judge them? It'd be very tempting in even our society
[401.46 --> 407.50]  today. And now comes the writer or writers of Hebrews. We don't know who wrote this book. Some say maybe a
[407.50 --> 414.46]  pastor in one of these communities. And they are giving some deeply encouraging words, encouraging them,
[414.46 --> 420.58]  the church, to hold fast to their faith in Jesus Christ because it's worth the struggle. It's worth the
[420.58 --> 426.66]  work. And in Jesus, they have all things. We'll see it in just a minute. But secondly, the writer or
[426.66 --> 436.64]  writers are saying, hold fast to your community of faith. You need them. They need you. You need to
[436.64 --> 442.64]  encourage them. They need to encourage you towards love and good deeds. You desperately need, even amidst the
[442.64 --> 450.12]  challenges of persecution and segregation, you need the church. Now, one thing that's worth noting, even
[450.12 --> 454.50]  before I read the passage again, is that almost every word in this passage is written in the second
[454.50 --> 460.42]  person plural. What's painful about Canadian English is we don't have a word from that other than you.
[461.10 --> 465.28]  The Americans, though, have got a killer word for the second person plural, and you know what it is?
[465.28 --> 471.68]  Y'all. Any Americans here? That's such a good word. And I so badly wish in our English translations of
[471.68 --> 476.26]  the Bible we had a y'all for the plural of you because this whole passage is written to the community,
[476.66 --> 482.62]  to the y'all. And before I read our first verse again, I want to note that this is, as my brother-in-law
[482.62 --> 489.56]  describes it, the lettuce passage. And he says lettuce because it's framed around three let us phrases.
[489.56 --> 495.70]  The first is in verse 22, where we read, let us draw near to God, an invitation to His presence.
[496.14 --> 502.08]  The second lettuce is let us hold on to hope of Jesus returning, the verse 23. And then the third
[502.08 --> 508.54]  one, which we'll spend most of our time on, is let us spur one another on towards love and good deeds,
[508.66 --> 517.34]  in verse 24. Let me read us again the first section, verse 19. Therefore, brothers and sisters,
[517.34 --> 523.10]  see the y'all already. Since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of Jesus,
[523.26 --> 529.26]  by a new and living way opened up for us through the curtain, that is His body, and since we have a
[529.26 --> 537.66]  great high priest over the house of God, let us draw near to God with sincere hearts and with full
[537.66 --> 542.16]  assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience,
[542.16 --> 548.00]  and having our bodies washed with pure water. Do you feel the encouragement there?
[549.12 --> 555.68]  The writer of this passage is just pouring out the invitation into God's presence. And in summary,
[555.92 --> 558.80]  I could preach a whole sermon on these verses, but in summary, the writer is saying,
[559.36 --> 565.28]  because the work of the cross is finished, you and I as followers of Jesus are invited right into
[565.28 --> 571.80]  holiness of God's presence. You have been invited into the depth and the beauty of God's presence,
[571.80 --> 578.06]  and He welcomes you there. You've been cleansed, you've been purified, and you belong.
[580.58 --> 584.90]  Now, I've pastored a hope long enough to know that many of us, when we pray or when we think about
[584.90 --> 590.02]  being silent with God, we struggle to believe, first, He really loves us, and second of all,
[590.06 --> 594.34]  that He's not just disappointed by something or a pattern of life that we have in our lives.
[594.34 --> 601.72]  And this passage reminds us that God is in a good mood, and He delights when His children come into
[601.72 --> 609.18]  His presence. There's an artist by the name of Elizabeth Wong. She focuses a lot on Jesus'
[609.40 --> 613.82]  intercessory ministry in her arts, and I want to show you a piece that she, this is probably 10 years
[613.82 --> 618.78]  old, I think. And I just want to draw your attention to, in the middle, that silhouette in the middle,
[618.78 --> 622.52]  you have what looks like a discouraged believer, right? They're kneeling, maybe in the posture of
[622.52 --> 627.26]  prayer, but maybe also in the sense of defeat. And then you have Jesus, right? Look at this picture
[627.26 --> 632.78]  of Jesus with His arms lifted high into the presence of God, and that line sort of moving from the
[632.78 --> 640.26]  person into God's very presence because of what Jesus did. There's your invitation. Jesus, the high
[640.26 --> 646.40]  priest, saying, come into the presence of my Father. You are cleansed, and you are welcome.
[646.40 --> 653.48]  Now, receive the invitation, church. Believe that you're welcome. That's the first lettuce.
[654.74 --> 659.10]  Now we get to the second lettuce, which is in verse 23, and it's all about hope.
[660.06 --> 667.80]  We read, let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for He who promised is faithful. And what
[667.80 --> 672.48]  He's mentioning there is that He who promised to Jesus, and He's faithful in that He said He's coming
[672.48 --> 677.88]  back, and He is coming back to heal all things. And a distinctive characteristic of the church
[677.88 --> 683.36]  throughout all ages, it may be true of us, is that the church does not give way to fear. We do not give
[683.36 --> 688.62]  way to discouragement, no matter what goes on in our cities, in our world, but we live with hope.
[689.98 --> 694.12]  And for that reason, I love the name of our church, don't you? It's never going to go out of style.
[694.12 --> 701.66]  We will always need to be a community of hope in a world of despair and isolation, and we hope for
[701.66 --> 708.66]  Jesus' return. There will be a day when politicians and world leaders do not chase after power only to
[708.66 --> 713.78]  abuse it for their own good. There will be a day where you do not hear stories of more wars between
[713.78 --> 718.82]  people, groups, and nations. There will be a day where you do not have to stand in the rain and weep
[718.82 --> 723.86]  as the body of your loved one is lowered into the ground in a casket, because Jesus will have come back.
[724.56 --> 729.90]  And all things will be made new, and sin and death and Satan will once and for all finally
[729.90 --> 736.98]  be done away with, because Jesus is coming. That's where you say amen, by the way. You're with me.
[737.22 --> 743.70]  You've had extra sleep. You should have lots of amens ready. Now we get to the third let us of our
[743.70 --> 748.44]  passage, and this is what we're going to spend a few more minutes on. We've been cleansed and welcomed
[748.44 --> 754.06]  into the presence of God. We're told that Jesus is coming, and while we wait, this is what Hebrews 10 says
[754.06 --> 762.36]  to us, and let us consider how we might spur one another on towards love and good deeds, not giving
[762.36 --> 769.68]  up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another, and all the more
[769.68 --> 779.94]  as you see the day of Jesus' return approaching. Isn't that a powerful verse? Let us consider how
[779.94 --> 786.88]  we might spur one another on towards love and good deeds, encouraging one another. And just to give you
[786.88 --> 791.42]  a sense of where we're going is, I'm going to say again, you need the church of Jesus to grow,
[792.00 --> 799.34]  to mature, to foster a love for others and for God, and to fight the battle against sin. In fact,
[799.36 --> 803.38]  I'm going to give you a fairly humorous illustration from a few years ago that's going to make the point
[803.38 --> 808.94]  of this passage in a strange kind of way. About 10 years ago, when we lived in Burnaby, and you should
[808.94 --> 813.22]  know there was a time when Brittany and I were like those Burnabites who looked down on Surrey,
[813.66 --> 817.62]  but not anymore. We're with you all the way. Who needs the people on that side of the bridge, hey?
[817.62 --> 822.36]  Okay. But there was a day where I went in our backyard in Burnaby, and I saw a mound of dirt.
[823.28 --> 826.86]  And then a few days later, I saw like six mounds of dirt. You know what this is, don't you?
[827.78 --> 833.56]  A mole. And my neighbor, my Taiwanese neighbor, he leans over the fence, and he just says to me,
[833.72 --> 839.86]  you have a mole. You have to kill that mole. And so I was like, mission accepted. And so I googled
[839.86 --> 845.02]  very briefly on how to kill a mole, and then I proceeded to do things that did not work. I put
[845.02 --> 848.82]  Zacto knives down some of the holes. I was told that worked. Filled gruesome. Didn't work.
[849.26 --> 853.48]  One afternoon, I wasted a whole ton of water and time trying to put a hose into the hole.
[853.90 --> 857.26]  Someone told me I could like flush it out, and that actually made things worse because I think
[857.26 --> 861.88]  it got so angry, like punched up like 10 of the holes the next day. And I was feeling very discouraged.
[862.10 --> 866.76]  My wife probably remembers this. And I went to church one of those Sundays, and I was telling one of
[866.76 --> 872.34]  the young adults in our church how hard it is to kill the mole. And he's like, oh man, we got this.
[872.34 --> 877.02]  Let's do this together. And the next Saturday, there was like eight or nine of us gathering in
[877.02 --> 882.36]  my backyard. We go to the Canadian Tire on Low Heat Highway, and we buy all these like sulfur sticks.
[882.58 --> 886.68]  I don't even know if they're legal anymore. They were very effective then. And we went to all the
[886.68 --> 891.70]  most recent holes we saw, lit these things. We felt like we were in the trenches of war. We like threw
[891.70 --> 897.28]  these sticks down the hole, and we smoked that thing to death. The best part of it was the next morning,
[897.28 --> 902.86]  I looked in my backyard. No moles. It was a good day. I don't celebrate killing animals,
[902.96 --> 907.04]  but I was happy for that mole to be gone. Now, why do I tell this long story about moles? I think
[907.04 --> 913.96]  this is an excellent metaphor of your and my battle with whatever it is we battle. By yourself,
[914.30 --> 920.14]  you are pretty much destined for failure. Name your vice of choice. Name the thing that trips you up.
[920.40 --> 924.44]  When you are by yourself, and you are isolated, and you try to fight that thing by yourself,
[924.44 --> 930.54]  it's not going to go well. And you know this, don't you? You know how hard it is to grow in faith
[930.54 --> 938.64]  and obedience to Jesus alone. And I'm convinced, by the way, that Satan knows this. I think Satan
[938.64 --> 941.96]  is delighted when believers are like, no, no, it's good. I don't need other people to help me. I don't
[941.96 --> 945.60]  need the prayers of people. I don't need the encouragement of people. I got this by myself.
[945.78 --> 951.82]  And he's like, no, you don't. And we hate to admit this as Western people who are so self-sufficient,
[951.82 --> 959.70]  but we are so vulnerable, so susceptible to temptation, and so painfully weak on our own.
[961.10 --> 966.52]  You have to believe that to know why this passage matters. But it's when we gather with other
[966.52 --> 972.06]  believers, when someone comes to you in church and say, we got this, then you see the stuff happen.
[972.96 --> 976.74]  You know, for the last eight weeks, we've been preaching on being a community of justice,
[976.74 --> 983.28]  being a community of selfless servanthood, being a community of peacemaking, a community of rest,
[983.64 --> 987.96]  a community of all these different dimensions of generosity. And now we think to ourselves,
[988.08 --> 994.88]  well, how do we do that? We need to do it together. Most of your growth and mine comes from seeing other
[994.88 --> 1002.18]  people living out their faith. Most of our maturity is by being in community. And the way that we grow
[1002.18 --> 1010.00]  is together. The way that we remain weak is isolated. A question that I've asked in our
[1010.00 --> 1013.98]  membership classes for years now, and some of you who are signed up, you're going to hear this
[1013.98 --> 1020.30]  question. You can share about it this week. But the question is, think of a time in your life where
[1020.30 --> 1025.68]  you were really growing, and you could sense it, right? Where you were sort of catching your stride in
[1025.68 --> 1029.74]  your walk with Christ. You felt like you were maturing and gaining faithfulness in whatever
[1029.74 --> 1035.00]  dimension that you're working on. Think about that right now for a second. What time is that for you?
[1036.08 --> 1040.52]  Is there a season that comes to mind? An experience that comes to mind?
[1042.40 --> 1047.52]  Based on all the years that I've been asking this, I have about 90 percent certainty that that season of
[1047.52 --> 1054.78]  maturity was a season of community. Am I wrong? Is that true for you? Maybe for you is the serve trip that
[1054.78 --> 1058.66]  you went on with friends and you served together, and you just felt the meaningful nature of Christian
[1058.66 --> 1064.00]  community gathering around an important project. Maybe it was the first time you got invited into
[1064.00 --> 1068.54]  a young adult small group, and you felt yourself opening up about vulnerable things and finding
[1068.54 --> 1074.44]  relationship and love. Maybe it's someone inviting you to their home, and you found a bit of relationship
[1074.44 --> 1079.04]  over whatever job you're facing, whatever job they're facing, but you found yourselves relating and
[1079.04 --> 1086.28]  growing together. But our growth is found in community, and we desperately need it.
[1086.28 --> 1091.56]  Now, if you've been around Hope for a while, you'll know that one of the things that we try to
[1091.56 --> 1095.94]  prioritize is our small groups. And Valerie, who led our service, she's our pastor of discipleship,
[1096.32 --> 1099.88]  she oversees all the different small groups and discipleship ministries of our church.
[1100.16 --> 1106.06]  And last I checked, just about half of our church is involved in some intentional discipleship
[1106.06 --> 1111.48]  ministry. And when I talk to other churches, that sounds like a good number. But, you know,
[1111.48 --> 1118.70]  if you put that on a grade for a paper, 50% is like a D minus? What is that, an F plus? It's not a good
[1118.70 --> 1125.54]  number, is it? I'm looking for teachers to get me on the right number. Is that a D minus? C plus? I don't
[1125.54 --> 1130.16]  know. We'll put it on a bell curve. It's a bad number, though. And so I want to share a bit about
[1130.16 --> 1134.34]  our small groups, and then I want to make some specific challenges for all of us, regardless of
[1134.34 --> 1140.62]  our situation in the church. Last summer, this past summer, Val put out an email to all our small
[1140.62 --> 1144.76]  groups saying, I want some feedback on how it's going, share what's going well, share some of the
[1144.76 --> 1148.68]  struggles. So now I'm going to share what you have shared, those of you who are in small groups. Here's
[1148.68 --> 1152.94]  some five things that were encouraging about the small group ministry of our church. Number one,
[1153.30 --> 1158.96]  it was noted how good it was to have new believers in small groups who ask the hard questions and
[1158.96 --> 1164.34]  invite some of those basic things to be sorted out together. Number two, people celebrated the
[1164.34 --> 1169.12]  different ages, stages, and cultural diversity of small groups. And I thought, that's one of the
[1169.12 --> 1173.30]  beauty of the church, by the way, right? You're not just around people like you, you're in the diverse
[1173.30 --> 1180.64]  body of Christ. Number three, support and prayer through crisis and difficulty. Number four, seeing
[1180.64 --> 1185.38]  God answer prayers. Isn't that such a gift? When you come together as a small group, and you're praying
[1185.38 --> 1189.30]  for somebody, you're praying for something, and you see God answer that prayer, what a gift in small
[1189.30 --> 1194.82]  groups. And then finally, praise the Lord for this. Number of people wrote accountability.
[1194.82 --> 1202.28]  That there's somebody, or there's a group of people who've got their eye on you, not with judgment,
[1202.50 --> 1206.76]  but with love. Where you're journeying together in prayer, and reading the scriptures, and growing
[1206.76 --> 1211.42]  whatever battles you face, there's people who are alongside you in the journey so that you grow
[1211.42 --> 1217.48]  together in accountability. That's where the magic happens. Now let me name the things that they said
[1217.48 --> 1220.60]  were not great. And if you're in a small group, I think you're going to resonate with these.
[1220.60 --> 1228.66]  The number one challenge that was named in this word is flaky. Flakiness. Do you know what the
[1228.66 --> 1234.02]  definition of flakiness is? You say you're going to come, but you don't. You say you'll be there on
[1234.02 --> 1238.88]  Thursday, but you're not. And then this is related to it. This is hilarious. This is the cascade of
[1238.88 --> 1243.48]  cancellations that happens when one person says they can't make it. Is that true of your group?
[1243.96 --> 1249.76]  Some resonance there? Yeah, knock it off. Just go anyway. But these are the challenges, and I just want
[1249.76 --> 1256.02]  to name them and say, stick it out. Sometimes we can idealize small groups, and you kind of want the
[1256.02 --> 1259.58]  perfect group with the perfect people with the perfect food, but you're not going to get the
[1259.58 --> 1262.74]  perfect group. You might get good food, but you're going to have people who are different than you,
[1262.82 --> 1266.60]  who think differently than you, who speak differently than you, and that's the gift of small groups,
[1267.20 --> 1271.32]  that you don't get the ideal group. You get the real group of humans who you get to grow with.
[1271.32 --> 1279.92]  So stick it out. Commit to it. Carve up the space for it. But here's now my shift of gears to talk to
[1279.92 --> 1285.12]  those of us who are not in small groups, the other half of our church. And my challenge is simply,
[1285.34 --> 1291.92]  in obedience to this passage, take the time to find the people you can grow with. I get that some of us
[1291.92 --> 1296.10]  have shift work, and it's very hard for us to be in a weekly small group. I get that some of us have
[1296.10 --> 1300.50]  very young kids, and it's not easy to have babies in small group at the same time and all the rest,
[1300.50 --> 1308.50]  but you do have to find someone, some people, some space to be encouraged and to encourage,
[1308.70 --> 1312.10]  to challenge and to comfort. And by the way, if you're interested in the Greek, that word
[1312.10 --> 1317.54]  encourage in Greek has all the meanings from challenge and exhort all the way to comfort.
[1317.70 --> 1322.32]  And so it's this whole range of relationship with one another as we grow and we sort out the faith
[1322.32 --> 1327.74]  together. But you need those people. And I say that partly because it's obedience to this passage,
[1327.74 --> 1334.04]  but here's my pastor's heart now. I want you in 20 years to be surrounded by people who have matured
[1334.04 --> 1340.00]  you in the faith. I don't want us to be isolated and segregated and feeling lonely in 20 years when
[1340.00 --> 1346.84]  we could have done the work now so that our future selves are mature in Christ. So please think of that
[1346.84 --> 1352.08]  person. And many of you already have it. Who can you go out for coffee with? Who can you have a breakfast
[1352.08 --> 1358.48]  meeting with? Who can you talk vulnerably about your faith and your struggles with? Reach out to
[1358.48 --> 1363.58]  that person and start there. Would you be willing to do that? Because that's one of the invitations of
[1363.58 --> 1371.06]  this passage. Consider how we can encourage one another. They need you. You need them. Not only are
[1371.06 --> 1375.98]  we called to receive the encouragement, but for many of us, maybe who've been seasoned and grown in Christ
[1375.98 --> 1381.42]  for quite a few years, it's time to start pouring yourself into a younger generation. It's time to
[1381.42 --> 1385.92]  use some of the gift you have with time and bless those who are in a younger generation to nurture
[1385.92 --> 1393.12]  and encourage their faith as well. This is what it means to be church. After the 9 a.m. service, I got
[1393.12 --> 1397.90]  permission to share that someone came up to me, and they shared that for the last year they've been sick,
[1398.70 --> 1404.80]  and they were not able to be in the church. They were not able to worship, and she shared that she felt
[1404.80 --> 1409.96]  not only the pain of loneliness and the pain of sickness, but the pain of spiritual attack.
[1411.16 --> 1414.74]  And it's not my story to tell, although I can share it vaguely, but that sense of feeling like
[1414.74 --> 1419.30]  Satan is going after her when she's by herself, and now she's able to be back in worship. She just
[1419.30 --> 1425.22]  celebrates the gift of Christian community. Take seriously not only the invitation to be in community,
[1425.70 --> 1433.94]  but our vulnerability when we are alone. Our passage closes with a bit of an ominous statement.
[1434.80 --> 1442.42]  It says, encourage one another all the more as we see the day approaching, and that's the day of
[1442.42 --> 1447.20]  Jesus' return, the day of Christ making all things new and judging sin and death forever.
[1448.10 --> 1452.90]  And I want you to know that there's a sense of urgency in this passage, knowing that things are
[1452.90 --> 1456.18]  very tough for the church, that people are leaving the church, that there's pressure against the church,
[1456.36 --> 1461.00]  and in result of that it's saying it's all the more important that you meet together. It's all the
[1461.00 --> 1466.14]  more important that you encourage one another because it's not easy following Jesus in a world
[1466.14 --> 1470.84]  that does not know Him, a world that does not find goodness in Him, and so we need each other all the
[1470.84 --> 1475.72]  more. There will be a day where near becomes here, and we will wish, as one writer put it, that we spent
[1475.72 --> 1480.86]  more time encouraging and building one another up in preparation for Jesus' glorious return.
[1480.86 --> 1492.44]  So in summary, we are invited to take hold of Christ by faith and enter into the presence of God with
[1492.44 --> 1498.32]  confidence because we as the body of Christ have been cleansed by His work, we've been set free by the
[1498.32 --> 1506.72]  cross, and we belong in God's presence. Secondly, we're invited to hope that there will come a day when
[1506.72 --> 1514.24]  Jesus will come again, and all will be made right that is wrong with the world. But thirdly, we are
[1514.24 --> 1520.88]  invited to journey together, to commit to one another, to meet together for the sake of maturity,
[1521.40 --> 1527.20]  growth, battling sin, and all the rest. And as we do that, we will not only experience the joy of Christ
[1527.20 --> 1536.50]  in our midst, but we will shine brightly in a culture that is increasingly isolated and lonely. Amen?
[1537.44 --> 1538.54]  Let me lead us in prayer.
[1545.20 --> 1551.48]  Father, I praise You that we get to be Your church. I praise You for all the miraculous stories,
[1551.60 --> 1557.50]  even in this gathering, of how You have drawn us out of isolation and forged us into Your family.
[1558.24 --> 1565.36]  I praise You by the unity of faith we have. And I ask even now, Lord, where there is loneliness,
[1565.36 --> 1572.28]  You would build us into deep community. Where there is isolation, we would reach out to those
[1572.28 --> 1579.54]  and invite them into community. I pray that You would enable us to see how critical it is for us,
[1580.22 --> 1587.76]  for our families, and for our future as a church. Spirit, would You give us those people who can walk
[1587.76 --> 1595.12]  with us. Would You give us the capacity to encourage those around us, to challenge and to comfort those
[1595.12 --> 1602.26]  who are struggling. Would You allow us, Lord, to experience the gift of being the body of Christ.
[1602.26 --> 1606.12]  We pray this in the name of Jesus, our Lord. Amen.
