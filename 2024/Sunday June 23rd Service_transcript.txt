[0.00 --> 12.18]  well good morning everyone it's a gift to be together it's a gift to be in worship and also
[12.18 --> 18.68]  have some meals together afterwards we are coming near to the end of our sermon series on the holy
[18.68 --> 23.22]  spirit and i thought it would be fitting for us to focus our attention this sunday where we're
[23.22 --> 29.90]  giving great thanks for all the ways people serve to talk and preach on spiritual gifts and so this
[29.90 --> 33.64]  morning we're going to look at a book that speaks and teaches a lot on that and that is the book of
[33.64 --> 38.58]  first corinthians if you have your bible turn with me to first corinthians 12 i'm going to read the
[38.58 --> 50.56]  first 11 verses first corinthians 12 now about the gifts of the spirit brothers and sisters i do not
[50.56 --> 57.54]  want you to be uninformed you know that when you were pagans somehow or other you were influenced
[57.54 --> 63.60]  and led astray to mute idols therefore i want you to know that no one who is speaking by the spirit
[63.60 --> 71.12]  of god says jesus be cursed and no one can say jesus is lord except by the holy spirit there are
[71.12 --> 76.00]  different kinds of gifts but the same spirit distributes them there are different kinds of
[76.00 --> 82.96]  service but the same lord there are different kinds of working but in all of them and in everyone it is
[82.96 --> 88.96]  the same god at work now to each one the manifestation of the spirit is given for the common good
[88.96 --> 94.96]  to one there is given through the spirit a message of wisdom to another a message of knowledge by means
[94.96 --> 102.00]  of the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by that one spirit
[102.00 --> 108.54]  to another miraculous powers to another prophecy to another distinguishing between spirits to another
[108.54 --> 115.32]  speaking in different kinds of tongues and still to another the interpretation of tongues all these
[115.32 --> 124.36]  are the works of the one and same spirit and he distributes them to each one just as he determines this is god's word
[124.36 --> 133.40]  now this is uh for many people in our church many students it's a graduation week i know we have a number of
[133.40 --> 139.24]  grade 12 and grade 8 students who have just walked across the stage and it brings me back to when i was a youth
[139.24 --> 145.50]  pastor we had this practice with grade 12 students and our practice was we'd invite all the grade 12s graduating to our home
[145.50 --> 150.32]  we'd have a meal and then we did this thing i don't even know who started it but it was called hot seat where we'd sit in the
[150.32 --> 155.52]  living room around a circle and we'd put one of the students in the middle and then for five to ten minutes with each
[155.52 --> 162.22]  student we would tell them how much we love them the ways that we've grown to appreciate them and then the gifts that they had
[162.22 --> 167.50]  and it was always you know very meaningful to have leaders speak and for britney and i to speak but there's something about
[167.50 --> 173.62]  peers who some of them you know they were in school together from kindergarten right to grade 12 and they'd look at each other
[173.62 --> 180.70]  and say like this is what i appreciate about you these are the gifts that god has given you whether it's encouragement
[180.70 --> 187.62]  or prayer or teaching and they would just sort of speak to each other these words and you know it was so wonderful to watch these
[187.62 --> 192.20]  students like squirm sheepishly you know how that goes when you get a compliment you don't know what to do with it
[192.20 --> 197.36]  or you know shed a few tears realizing like god is good he's given these students gifts they've got
[197.36 --> 203.68]  their whole life to unpack and serve with that gift but that time with grade 12 students in my living room
[203.68 --> 210.10]  year after year was my annual reminder that when people are in the church and they serve jesus they not
[210.10 --> 217.28]  only get the gift of the spirit but the spirit gives gifts for the church to use for service and blessing
[217.28 --> 225.44]  now our passage starts with paul just saying now about the gifts of the spirit and we need to know
[225.44 --> 230.06]  is he's been in conversation with this church in corinth about the spirit about spiritual gifts but he
[230.06 --> 235.52]  doesn't stop here and say hey this is what i mean by spiritual gifts paul speaks in many different
[235.52 --> 240.48]  places about different giftings not exhaustively but i want to share with you one definition of spiritual
[240.48 --> 246.56]  gifts that comes from a writer named bruce bugby and yes that is an amazing last name bruce bugby
[246.56 --> 254.58]  describes spiritual gifts as such spiritual gifts are divine abilities that are distributed by the
[254.58 --> 259.36]  holy spirit to every believer do you hear that not just some but every believer according to god's
[259.36 --> 266.34]  design and grace for the common good of the body of christ now the spirit when it moves in the church
[266.34 --> 272.42]  gives many different gifts to many different people for very diverse purposes we are such different
[272.42 --> 278.38]  people personality wise and we have such different gifts and as we take hold of those gifts i think it
[278.38 --> 282.16]  does at least three things and this comes from our spiritual gift seminar a few weeks ago number one
[282.16 --> 291.26]  it brings delight to the disciple when you do the thing you are wired to do you feel joy and it's
[291.26 --> 295.30]  worth looking back on your life and you kind of discover vocational strengths we discover relational
[295.30 --> 299.38]  strengths also you're like now i'm working in my lane i'm not going against the grain that's how i'm
[299.38 --> 305.32]  gifted secondly it's in this passage it leads to the blessing and the common good of those who are
[305.32 --> 310.20]  around you when you use your gifts others receive the benefit of those gifts are not just for you
[310.20 --> 317.28]  and thirdly of great importance when we use our gifts and serve with them god is glorified
[317.28 --> 324.82]  he's honored by us picking up these gifts receiving them and using them for others in fact i picture god
[324.82 --> 329.86]  like a loving father who you know watches a child grow and that child discovers their gifts and your
[329.86 --> 336.64]  heart as a father swells with pride as you see that child grow and use and employ the specific gifts
[336.64 --> 338.58]  that they were created to use
[338.58 --> 347.78]  very few churches experience the richness of these gifts or perhaps struggle to understand how to use
[347.78 --> 352.50]  them like corinth but before i get into the passage i just want to name that spiritual gifts are named
[352.50 --> 358.26]  in first corinthians as well as romans 12 as well as ephesians 4 and there's no exhaustive list some
[358.26 --> 362.50]  people suggest that paul just named the gifts that were in that community but i want to put up on the
[362.50 --> 366.26]  screen how one writer puts them all together in groupings i think it's helpful to think of the
[366.26 --> 371.06]  different gifts in groupings and i'll just share with you one way of structuring them there are number
[371.06 --> 378.02]  one the love gifts the power gifts the word gifts and the leadership gifts and this is not exhaustive but the
[378.02 --> 387.46]  love gifts would include mercy generosity hospitality encouragement power gifts miracles faith speaking
[387.46 --> 395.22]  in tongues healing word gifts exhortation wisdom discernment words of knowledge and leadership gifts
[395.22 --> 402.10]  this is ephesians 4 the giving of the apostles the evangelists the pastors the teachers and uh just to
[402.10 --> 406.98]  be clear it's important not to sort of try to pick one out and say okay that's me i'm hospitality
[406.98 --> 412.34]  which is probably true for many people but usually we've got a bunch of gifts god is a generous
[412.34 --> 418.74]  giver most people have generosity and healing exhortation or evangelism wisdom and mercy we've got
[418.74 --> 425.70]  a cluster of them to use and serve with because that's how generous god is in the church if there
[425.70 --> 430.66]  was ever a church that sort of received and sort of flexed and leaned into these gifts especially the
[430.66 --> 436.26]  power gifts it was the church of corinth and uh i i have such an interest in how these different
[436.26 --> 441.06]  churches live because you've got some churches uh that don't speak much of spiritual gifts and then
[441.06 --> 446.26]  you've got corinth this young immature believing community that was just like filled with the spirit
[446.26 --> 452.34]  and we're exercising the gifts of the spirit and it was absolute chaos you know and just just marvel
[452.34 --> 456.50]  with me you know you've got this church in galatia and they're having major division with like
[456.50 --> 462.10]  judaizers and false teaching then you've got the church in thessalonians and they are like twiddling their
[462.10 --> 466.10]  thumbs doing nothing waiting for jesus to come back and then you've got the corinthian church
[466.10 --> 471.06]  and it's just chaos all these gifts being used very immature leaders and paul's got to reign them
[471.06 --> 478.58]  in he's got his work cut out for them but if you are a person who really likes orderly structured quiet
[478.58 --> 484.90]  worship you would not fit in the corinthian church you wouldn't like that one uh you would find that
[484.90 --> 489.22]  there's people speaking prophetic words there's tongues being spoken different languages that you
[489.22 --> 494.42]  couldn't understand and people speaking all these different words at the same time it was a cacophony
[494.42 --> 500.50]  of gifts and paul comes in and says there needs to be some order here there needs to be some structure
[500.50 --> 504.98]  and as like you know somebody who likes order and structure as a dutch person i was like yeah paul
[504.98 --> 510.58]  give it to him he's got some other stuff for us today don't you worry but i appreciate paul coming
[510.58 --> 515.78]  in and saying these are important gifts god's given them let's let's like steward these gifts with love
[515.78 --> 521.86]  and care now to understand what paul is saying in this passage we do need to step back and say
[521.86 --> 527.94]  what's going on in the culture many of the believers in the corinthian church grew up in a corinthian
[527.94 --> 532.34]  culture and you should know that there are many cults many religious groups many little groupings of
[532.34 --> 537.14]  people that had spiritual experiences just like today in our city if you want a spiritual experience
[537.14 --> 542.66]  you go to many different places and some of these groups they had really exciting things going on like
[542.66 --> 549.22]  people were doing crazy stuff there's movement dances a lot stuff happening but it wasn't oriented
[549.22 --> 554.90]  around jesus a lot of times it was about having an experience having an experience in your emotions
[554.90 --> 559.94]  of movement and paul says if it's going to be moved by the spirit it's got to look a certain way
[560.66 --> 566.18]  and what he says in verse three is no one can say jesus is lord except by the holy spirit and part of
[566.18 --> 571.06]  what's behind this he's saying you can have a lot of spiritual experiences but if it's going to be
[571.06 --> 577.22]  moved by the spirit it's going to be driven by the holy spirit it's going to lead to the exaltation of
[577.22 --> 582.34]  jesus it's not first and foremost about your emotions it's not first and foremost about some kind of
[582.34 --> 587.22]  experience it is about the exaltation and the glorification of jesus and if it's not that we
[587.22 --> 593.46]  should be worried now because we are not some like crazy charismatic church i can say the opposite and
[593.46 --> 597.78]  hopefully not hurt too many feelings you ready for this that doesn't mean you can't be expressive in
[597.78 --> 603.46]  worship and there's some really funny memes on the internet uh and if you're into that you can look
[603.46 --> 608.98]  up reformed means and it shows like a reformed person enjoying worship and it just shows a person
[608.98 --> 616.02]  like this and if you know you know like reformed churches are known for being very solemn very serious
[616.02 --> 621.14]  and sometimes we sing songs about excitement and joy i'm like our bodies betray what we're singing here
[621.14 --> 628.42]  but we can be full of joy and movement and dance and just make sure as paul says that it's exalting
[628.42 --> 634.82]  the name of jesus because that is the goal of what's happening in the church now the specific
[634.82 --> 640.26]  concern of first corinthians 12 here is actually the way in which the church of corinth is elevating
[640.26 --> 645.86]  and platforming certain gifts and devaluing and sort of putting to the side other gifts that the spirit
[645.86 --> 650.34]  gives the church and it's interesting not coincidental that the spiritual gifts they're
[650.34 --> 655.70]  elevating are the exciting ones right speaking in tongues prophetic words things that are really
[655.70 --> 660.02]  happening in the middle of the worship services and if you read more of this book you'll see that paul
[660.02 --> 665.30]  keeps coming back to like how disorderly and chaotic their worship is because they're all just like
[665.30 --> 671.46]  speaking over each other no one knows what's going on it's a mess paul says okay these gifts are real
[671.46 --> 676.74]  but they're only two of the gifts remember not to neglect all the rest just because you think they
[676.74 --> 684.42]  might be less exciting less you know moving and less of a severe experience all the gifts matter and
[684.42 --> 689.78]  i want to read for you important words from our passage in verse four to six which uh brayden i appreciate
[689.78 --> 697.06]  your reading earlier in the service we read there are different gifts but the same spirit distributes them
[697.06 --> 703.46]  there are different kinds of service but the same lord there are different kinds of working but in
[703.46 --> 711.06]  all of them and in everyone is the same god at work and that's basically paul's way of saying all the
[711.06 --> 717.46]  gifts are essential necessary and of equal value in the body of christ in fact if you read romans 12 which
[717.46 --> 722.10]  is a co-text through first corinthians 12 paul says it this way just smashes all the gifts together
[722.10 --> 727.86]  he says if your gift is prophesying prophesy if it's encouraging encourage if it's teaching then
[727.86 --> 732.82]  teach if it's giving give generously it's basically saying whatever your gift is doesn't matter what
[732.82 --> 738.98]  kind of gift it is use it to serve and i like that how it's like there's not one up here and one down
[738.98 --> 745.46]  here they're all gifts given to the church all of them are essential even the hidden gifts all are
[745.46 --> 751.46]  necessary for the building up of the body and the blessing of the city or to put it a different way more
[751.46 --> 757.54]  poignantly prophesying is not more important than encouragement the gift of healing is not more
[757.54 --> 762.82]  important than teaching preschoolers upstairs the gift of healing is not more important than that
[762.82 --> 770.26]  of hospitality do we believe this now i remember a person named david fairchild sharing a story of when
[770.26 --> 775.22]  he was growing up he got invited by someone to a charismatic conference and if you've been to these you
[775.22 --> 779.22]  know what they're like but uh he was not a christian at the time invited to this conference and they said
[779.22 --> 784.10]  come to the stage we're going to pray for you and you are going to speak in tongues david fairchild's
[784.10 --> 788.58]  like that sounds great let's do this so he goes up to the stage there's a guy praying for him nothing
[788.58 --> 793.94]  happens bit awkward he's in public a lot of people this conference the guy keeps praying for him
[793.94 --> 797.86]  nothing happens there's people around him experiencing all these things he's just standing
[797.86 --> 802.50]  there and eventually he just walks back to his seat saying i guess this stuff's not for me i guess i don't
[802.50 --> 806.26]  have the spirit i guess i'm not meant to be part of the church and it was deeply discouraging
[806.26 --> 811.62]  and it took him at least 10 years to realize as he was discipled into the way of christ learned the
[811.62 --> 816.42]  scriptures understood his own gift he's he just learned i have gifts in teaching and preaching
[816.42 --> 821.94]  he's a pastor now i just don't have the gift of tongues and how heartbreaking is it that his
[821.94 --> 826.66]  introduction to spiritual gifts was i guess this one's not for you i guess you should sit down now
[826.66 --> 834.58]  given that it's appreciation sunday i want to step back and take a few moments to celebrate
[835.22 --> 840.50]  i want to take a few moments to celebrate the diverse gifts in this body you know two weeks ago
[840.50 --> 843.78]  i already mentioned this we had a spiritual gift seminar and we had everyone who was there right
[843.78 --> 847.86]  on the wall they just sort of named their gifts which is a bit intimidating you know put your name
[847.86 --> 852.10]  down beside these certain gifts i had a sheet that val wrote for me and i don't have it up here
[852.10 --> 859.30]  but uh i just celebrated all the different ways people said yes that is my gift and i want to
[859.30 --> 863.22]  serve with it and based on that and some of my knowledge of people in our church i just want to
[863.22 --> 869.30]  say a few names here praise the lord for the gift of hospitality and who would we be without people like
[869.30 --> 876.10]  sonia and doug and philip who's probably barbecuing right now and others in our church who are just
[876.10 --> 880.42]  the deeply hospitable people in our church you meet them you feel like you're part of their family
[880.42 --> 884.74]  and there's a good chance you're going to be in their home who would we be without the gifts of
[884.74 --> 891.62]  mercy that are embodied by our deacons by florence john pam and others in our church who are seeking
[891.62 --> 898.90]  to serve the needs in our community who would we be without the gifts of intercession lydia jacob
[898.90 --> 905.70]  joyce esther who would we be without the gift of leadership brayden who is up here andre others in
[905.70 --> 911.22]  our church who lead well as elders in our church what a gift to have these gifts and when they all
[911.22 --> 917.06]  come together there is that beauty and blessing and the church is enriched and can i just say this
[917.70 --> 924.02]  this has been a good year of ministry god has been good to us we continue to grow new people become
[924.02 --> 928.82]  christians in our church our children are learning the story praise the lord and it's not just because
[928.82 --> 935.38]  of a few of us on the stage who are teaching it's because the gifts in this body are being used for the
[935.38 --> 940.66]  building up and the blessing of our community praise the lord for that as a pastor who has one little
[940.66 --> 948.34]  role up here on stage i am so grateful for the seen and unseen ways people serve selflessly
[948.90 --> 955.78]  quietly to disciple to teach to grow to care to nurture to pray god is answering our prayers
[959.30 --> 964.42]  now the issue in corinth as i mentioned was that some gifts got platformed some got relegated to the
[964.42 --> 970.58]  side some were important and special and some were not named at all and the question i have is how
[970.58 --> 979.30]  might that be true for us are there conscious or unconscious ways we platform sun gifts and we forget
[979.30 --> 985.38]  to talk about and honor others josiah bookman when he was here teaching on spiritual gifts he says most
[985.38 --> 990.90]  churches play favorites in one way or another and so now i'm going to just do some wondering with us you
[990.90 --> 996.34]  know some churches they value the power gifts that we had on the screen the healing prophetic words
[996.34 --> 1002.58]  etc and they don't value the administrative gifts and that might be what corinth described as other
[1002.58 --> 1009.86]  churches if i can pick on the dutch church that i grew up in values very much order and structure and so
[1009.86 --> 1016.90]  we look for people with the gift of administration we want orderly very detailed organized plans and
[1016.90 --> 1021.46]  leadership who bring these things together and we kind of don't talk much about the spiritual gifts
[1021.46 --> 1029.14]  like healing and prophecy etc some churches and this is true in the protestant world really value the
[1029.14 --> 1035.06]  teaching preaching gifts and i'm grateful those are the gifts that i think i have but at the expense of
[1035.06 --> 1039.78]  everything else so all that matters in the worship service is what's said about the scriptures the
[1039.78 --> 1044.18]  worship is less important community is less important all that matters is teaching and that can be a
[1044.18 --> 1051.06]  serious problem the pastor i mentioned earlier david fairchild he said be careful of churches that
[1051.06 --> 1056.42]  focus everything just on the teaching ministry he says this is what kind of church it is it's a t-rex church
[1057.54 --> 1064.66]  you know what that means it's got a giant mouth talking a lot and tiny useless little hands
[1066.50 --> 1072.10]  let's be careful not to be a t-rex church i celebrate the fact that we've got lots of hands and feet and
[1072.10 --> 1076.74]  movement in our church blessing the city discipling the church because it's dangerous just have a big voice
[1076.74 --> 1084.26]  talking and no action that's not a healthy church but now to get more specific and maybe more to the point even our own
[1084.26 --> 1091.14]  church what might be the gifts that we're not taking seriously in our body what might be the things that we're
[1091.14 --> 1099.86]  just not quite comfortable talking about and celebrating and i'm just going to read the list named in this passage and ask you are we
[1099.86 --> 1108.34]  nurturing and celebrating these gifts you ready some have a message of knowledge some are given the gift of faith
[1109.14 --> 1115.22]  some are given the gift of healing some are given the gift of miraculous powers some are given the gift of
[1115.22 --> 1121.22]  prophecy some are given the gift of distinguishing spirits some are given the gift of speaking in tongues
[1121.22 --> 1129.70]  still others are given the gift of interpreting those tongues i wonder if i may be so bold if we have
[1129.70 --> 1136.18]  the opposite problem to the corinthian church they might have thought of hospitality and administration
[1136.18 --> 1141.94]  and leading as boring and all the spiritual power gifts as up here and maybe in our context in our city
[1141.94 --> 1148.58]  in our time we've reversed that and to put a finer point on it i remember when we had our conference just
[1148.58 --> 1153.38]  a few weeks ago on spiritual gifts we invited three people up to the front to talk about what their
[1153.38 --> 1158.18]  spiritual gift was how they discovered it and how they're seeking to use that gift to serve we had
[1158.18 --> 1163.94]  jan reynolds are you in the service jan are we in the 9am she was in the 9am jan had the gift of teaching
[1163.94 --> 1168.74]  and what a gift she is by the way in our women's bible study in her gift of teaching then we had philip
[1168.74 --> 1173.70]  who's barbecuing right now with the gift of hospitality and he was sharing how he learned that how he serves in
[1173.70 --> 1178.82]  that even vocationally and then we had joe okilebo where's joe there you are joe shared about the gift
[1178.82 --> 1184.18]  of prophecy and the gift of understanding words of knowledge and then uh as everyone shared joe was
[1184.18 --> 1190.34]  the only one to say since moving from nigeria to canada i am quote unquote nervous to talk about this
[1190.34 --> 1197.06]  gift and nervous to exercise that gift in our church and my pastor's heart broke because that was
[1197.06 --> 1201.06]  one of the moments where i realized maybe unconsciously we've put administration and teaching
[1201.06 --> 1206.98]  and leadership and hospitality up here and healing prophetic words and all the rest down here and joe
[1206.98 --> 1215.22]  i am so glad that god brought you to our church and not just you but everyone who has the gifts of
[1215.22 --> 1222.66]  prophetic words words of knowledge discernment healing i am so thankful that you are in our church we
[1223.30 --> 1229.94]  need those gifts in this body and if you are interested in those and those are awakening in you i want
[1229.94 --> 1234.50]  you to talk to joe or talk to me we want to steward those we want to enliven them we want to really
[1234.50 --> 1239.22]  bring them to fruition so that we have words of prophecy in our church we have people praying for
[1239.22 --> 1247.70]  healing in our church because we need those power gifts in our church they have not gone away a lot of
[1247.70 --> 1251.22]  times there are christians in the west who just because we haven't seen healing or we haven't heard
[1251.22 --> 1255.78]  prophetic words we just think well i guess that's the end but the global church bears witness to these
[1255.78 --> 1260.34]  gifts the scriptures never tell us by the way when the apostles finish their ministry that they just
[1260.34 --> 1264.18]  go away in fact i would say the book of acts suggests that the church continues in the power of
[1264.18 --> 1269.22]  the spirit with all the prophetic gifts and all the healing gifts and all the other gifts named in this
[1269.22 --> 1277.30]  passage and some of us present company included have been overly suspicious of some of these gifts and
[1277.30 --> 1283.22]  maybe for good reason because we turn on the tv we see this faith healer on the television and we see how
[1283.22 --> 1287.70]  they're using the money they get to buy not the first not their second but their third jet it's a
[1287.70 --> 1292.34]  bit of a problem they sort of abuse the gift but let's not just throw the baby out with the bath water
[1292.98 --> 1298.34]  these gifts mentioned in first corinthians 12 are needed in the church of jesus christ they're needed
[1298.34 --> 1307.46]  at hope community church and we want you to hear from the stage that these matter to us and if you've been
[1307.46 --> 1312.02]  you know i we had two conversations after the nine a.m service one really moved me because
[1312.66 --> 1318.58]  people often have gifts from their year youngest years and they just think well maybe everyone has
[1318.58 --> 1322.10]  this and someone was just sharing how as long as they've been praying they always have images
[1322.10 --> 1326.02]  often for other people but they've never had someone say hey that's a spiritual gift we want
[1326.02 --> 1329.86]  you to serve with that and i just want to say if you've had ways where you're praying or things
[1329.86 --> 1335.62]  where you're just sensing god speaking to you just lean into that and see where god takes it in service
[1335.62 --> 1339.54]  for the church we need all the gifts serving the kingdom
[1343.06 --> 1348.26]  now we get to verse seven verse seven is a really important verse because here's where we get the why
[1348.26 --> 1353.54]  let me read it for us again now to each of us each one the manifestation of the spirit has been given why
[1355.30 --> 1361.38]  for the common good in our context one of the dangers of spiritual gifts is that it gets sucked into our
[1361.38 --> 1366.10]  selfish individualistic culture where it's like this is my gift that's not my gift this is my
[1366.10 --> 1371.46]  personality type that's not my personality type this is who i am that's who you are rather than saying
[1371.46 --> 1378.18]  the gift was given for the sake of others whatever your spiritual gift is it is not at the end of the
[1378.18 --> 1386.98]  day about you it's about building up the body of christ and serving it is about the person beside you to
[1386.98 --> 1394.02]  teach to care to pray to love to nurture to grow to speak and i love how paul puts it in ephesians 4
[1394.02 --> 1401.46]  this passage is one of my favorites of ephesians and paul just says from him christ the whole body joined and
[1401.46 --> 1410.66]  held together by every supporting ligament grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work
[1411.38 --> 1416.58]  and the implication is there is less love and there is less growth if people retreat from and hold their
[1416.58 --> 1424.02]  gifts to themselves selfishly we need all the gifts all the works all the service in the body of christ to
[1424.02 --> 1425.14]  be healthy and to grow
[1425.14 --> 1430.34]  and now i'm going to make what i think is my second last point
[1432.02 --> 1440.82]  we live in a city just like first corinthians where many people worship mute idols there are
[1440.82 --> 1445.38]  many people who will find a spiritual experience in something other than jesus in fact this week
[1445.38 --> 1449.70]  i was chatting in the office with jonathan and with misha and i said okay what are the things that
[1449.70 --> 1453.86]  people get pumped up about and find a spiritual experience in in our city you know what the two things
[1453.86 --> 1461.30]  they said are number one concerts anyone been to a really big concert rogers arena there's something
[1461.30 --> 1465.38]  about concerts and i think they know how to design them and organize them and have the music just right
[1465.38 --> 1470.50]  such that you feel something it moves you there's like it's energy in these concerts that's a spiritual
[1470.50 --> 1475.06]  experience and people there's a lot of concert chasers because they want that spiritual experience
[1475.06 --> 1479.14]  the other one that jonathan mentioned close to home for people wearing oilers jersey i don't know who they
[1479.14 --> 1485.38]  are but the other one is sports and if you've ever been to an arena for your favorite team let's say
[1485.38 --> 1490.58]  they're the oilers and you dress with a you know a heretical t-shirt on sunday morning i'm just kidding
[1493.38 --> 1497.70]  but you can look around and there are fans and then there are those for whom you're like
[1497.70 --> 1503.30]  that right there is your religion you know you've painted a cup on your face and all the rest and
[1503.30 --> 1508.90]  you just think these people now more seriously these people do not know that life that is truly
[1508.90 --> 1515.22]  life is found in and only through jesus christ and what they need to see is a community that actually
[1515.22 --> 1522.26]  seeks to serve and follow jesus christ they need to see people finding the life of the spirit in and
[1522.26 --> 1527.70]  through the work of jesus they need to see people who live in community in such a way that greed turns
[1527.70 --> 1533.38]  into generosity selfishness moves to selflessness where people are using all the gifts that god has
[1533.38 --> 1539.94]  given in all the diverse ways to build and serve others and i tell you what when i see it in our
[1539.94 --> 1544.58]  church and when people who visit our church are new to our church see it it's a beautiful thing
[1546.10 --> 1551.78]  a pastor friend of mine who uh is no longer in ministry uh serving a non-profit i remember he he was
[1551.78 --> 1556.02]  involved in chamber of commerce and another number of other non-profits and businesses and he said you know
[1556.02 --> 1560.74]  there's nothing like a church when all the gifts are put together whether it's for fundraising or
[1560.74 --> 1564.74]  serving or caring for the needs of the city there's nothing like all the gifts of a church being brought
[1564.74 --> 1571.54]  together for the common good it's a beautiful thing and that's what we offer our city that is seeking
[1571.54 --> 1579.38]  to find meaning and satisfaction in mute idols now here's my actual final point hold me to it
[1580.82 --> 1585.70]  we we we conclude where we started and that is the naming of gifts i think it's hard to serve and
[1585.70 --> 1590.50]  grow in your gifts if you do not know what they are and i after years of youth ministry and now
[1590.50 --> 1594.98]  serving at hope for over eight years i think the challenge many of us face is we don't even know
[1594.98 --> 1600.90]  what our gifts are or we're so timid and self-conscious and self-doubting that we really don't say yes
[1600.90 --> 1606.98]  that is my gift and what is needed is for people who love you and know you to come around you and say
[1606.98 --> 1612.90]  that is your gift i've had people do that for me i know that's happened with my wife where someone who
[1612.90 --> 1618.58]  is like a teacher or professor or a pastor or a youth pastor just say i know you i see you this is
[1618.58 --> 1624.74]  your gift and just a story i heard recently was a teenage girl sitting on the couch there was a
[1624.74 --> 1628.10]  conversation i don't know how it started about spiritual gifts and she kind of just leaned back
[1628.10 --> 1631.94]  in the couch with a sense of despair it's like i don't even know what i'm good i don't even know
[1631.94 --> 1637.54]  what i'm gifted in and her dad sitting on the couch right beside her he's hearing that and he just
[1637.54 --> 1641.94]  leans forward with his eyes wide open he says you don't know what you're good at and he starts
[1641.94 --> 1646.66]  rattling off all these gifts she has all the things he's seen from the moment she was born
[1646.66 --> 1652.26]  and what makes me i love that story but what makes me lament is why did it take her to be a teenager
[1652.26 --> 1658.90]  for him to finally open his mouth and say it so the task for us today is whether it's over the
[1658.90 --> 1662.90]  barbecue outside after the service or at the dinner table with your fan your family and your kids
[1662.90 --> 1670.18]  or your grandkids take the time say it out loud to those you know and those who you know well and
[1670.18 --> 1676.90]  you can say i've seen you for this many years you are gifted as a teacher i've known you for a number
[1676.90 --> 1682.26]  of years now i know that you have the gift of intercession or the gift of hospitality or the gift
[1682.26 --> 1688.66]  of leadership or whatever the gift may be call it forth out of people allow god to use you as the
[1688.66 --> 1694.58]  conduit to encourage others to take hold of that gift because it will lead to their own delight as
[1694.58 --> 1700.18]  they lean into what god's given them it will build up and bless our church as we serve together and
[1700.18 --> 1707.22]  finally it will bring glory to our heavenly father who has given these gifts generously so that we can serve
[1707.22 --> 1711.54]  and thrive let me lead us in a prayer
[1718.26 --> 1724.34]  father we thank you so much for equipping our church with all the different gifts that you've given
[1725.46 --> 1732.82]  we thank you for the love gifts for the leadership gifts for the word gifts and for the power gifts
[1732.82 --> 1739.94]  and i ask that you'd forgive us for the way that we platform some and ignore others for the way we
[1739.94 --> 1747.30]  quietly envy some and don't even pray for others and i ask that you would awaken in our church all of the
[1747.30 --> 1753.06]  gifts that you've given i pray those gifts which are dormant would come alive that you use our words
[1753.06 --> 1758.34]  this week to speak and call forth gifts that have never been named and i pray even more than that that
[1758.34 --> 1765.62]  we take these gifts dearly and serve with them where there is timidity i pray that you would give
[1765.62 --> 1773.30]  confidence where there is pride and selfishness i pray that you give humility and lord our deep hope
[1774.50 --> 1782.98]  is that you would use all the gifts you've given to us so that we can bless our friends our neighbors our
[1782.98 --> 1790.10]  families our city and we pray that in and through all of it the name of jesus christ would be exalted
[1791.06 --> 1793.46]  we pray this in his name amen
[1796.02 --> 1798.98]  before you stand i want to say just a few words about this next song
[1800.02 --> 1804.42]  i picked the song of response we've sung it a handful of times so it might be a little bit new for you
[1804.42 --> 1811.06]  but it's called your labor is not in vain and i picked it because i know that when you serve even
[1811.06 --> 1816.34]  vocationally or serve with your spiritual gifts in the church there is joy and there is hardship
[1817.14 --> 1821.62]  there is that sense of yes this is what i've got and how i can serve and there's also deep
[1821.62 --> 1826.10]  discouragement whether it's the plan you make that falls flat whether it's the people you invite in
[1826.10 --> 1829.94]  that cancel on you at the last second whether it's this thing you thought was going to have a lot of
[1829.94 --> 1836.58]  momentum that falls dead there's a lot of discouragement that comes with serving with your gifts and this
[1836.58 --> 1844.50]  song is all about saying god sees that he knows that and he's with you so this is a song actually
[1844.50 --> 1850.02]  sung from the perspective of god and the song is called your labor is not in vain so we'll stand and
[1850.02 --> 1859.94]  sing this song of response together
[1859.94 --> 1871.86]  your labor is
[1871.86 --> 1883.62]  as
[1885.78 --> 1887.78]  oh
[1892.58 --> 1893.86]  so
[1893.86 --> 1897.68]  Your labor is not unknown
[1897.68 --> 1903.26]  Though the rocks may cry out
[1903.26 --> 1906.80]  And the sea it may go
[1906.80 --> 1910.32]  The place of your throne
[1910.32 --> 1913.88]  May not seem like a home
[1913.88 --> 1919.06]  Your labor is not unknown
[1919.06 --> 1923.84]  For I am with you
[1923.84 --> 1927.44]  I am with you
[1927.44 --> 1931.00]  I am with you
[1931.00 --> 1934.52]  I am with you
[1934.52 --> 1937.70]  For I have called you
[1937.70 --> 1941.54]  Called you by name
[1941.54 --> 1947.18]  Your labor is not unknown
[1947.18 --> 1953.14]  The vineyard you plant
[1953.14 --> 1955.10]  Will bear fruit
[1955.10 --> 1960.18]  The field will sing out
[1960.18 --> 1963.84]  And rejoice with the truth
[1963.84 --> 1967.24]  For all that is old
[1967.24 --> 1970.82]  Will at last be made through
[1970.82 --> 1974.38]  The vineyard you plant
[1974.38 --> 1976.38]  Will bear fruit
[1976.38 --> 1980.34]  I am with you
[1980.34 --> 1984.34]  I am with you
[1984.34 --> 1987.34]  I am with you
[1987.34 --> 1989.34]  I am with you
[1989.34 --> 1994.58]  For I have called you
[1994.58 --> 1997.38]  Called you by name
[1997.38 --> 2003.34]  Your labor is not unknown
[2003.34 --> 2012.30]  The houses you labor to build
[2012.30 --> 2017.30]  Will finally with laughter
[2017.30 --> 2020.74]  And joy be filled
[2020.74 --> 2024.12]  The serpent that hurts
[2024.12 --> 2027.64]  And destroys will be killed
[2027.64 --> 2029.64]  And all that is broken
[2029.64 --> 2031.26]  And all that is broken
[2031.26 --> 2031.50]  And all that is broken
[2031.50 --> 2036.28]  Be
[2038.54 --> 2039.46]  I am with you
[2039.46 --> 2039.76]  I am with you
[2039.76 --> 2040.54]  I am with you
[2040.60 --> 2043.32]  I am with you
[2043.32 --> 2044.02]  I am with you
[2044.02 --> 2044.14]  I am with you
[2044.64 --> 2045.74]  I am with you
[2045.74 --> 2045.82]  I am with you
[2045.82 --> 2046.64]  I am with you
[2046.64 --> 2046.90]  I am with you
[2046.90 --> 2048.90]  you
[2066.48 --> 2067.52]  body
[2071.16 --> 2072.96]  way
[2073.48 --> 2075.48]  I
[2076.90 --> 2083.62]  For I have called you, called you by name.
[2084.98 --> 2090.78]  Your labor is not in vain.
[2095.78 --> 2096.38]  Amen.
[2097.00 --> 2100.60]  You know, in all the gifts that I named, I forgot to even mention the gift of music.
[2100.78 --> 2102.00]  So thank you for leaving us.
[2102.40 --> 2103.50]  It was a privilege, yes.
[2103.66 --> 2103.92]  Amen.
[2103.92 --> 2104.08]  Amen.
[2106.90 --> 2109.88]  Just two things to note.
[2110.30 --> 2111.90]  There's probably more, but I can remember two.
[2112.20 --> 2116.46]  Number one, one of the gifts that we give to the church is our treasure.
[2117.32 --> 2121.06]  And we seek to use all the money that God has given us to be a blessing in our city.
[2121.40 --> 2124.38]  If you're new, you can talk to one of our deacons who is by the coffee bar,
[2124.46 --> 2126.20]  and they can share with you the different ways to give.
[2126.42 --> 2128.88]  But we invite you to practice generosity this week.
[2130.58 --> 2135.00]  Secondly, don't go anywhere after the service except for to the front yard.
[2135.00 --> 2138.40]  And I think the front yard, whatever, side yard, is it a yard?
[2139.32 --> 2139.68]  Grass.
[2140.44 --> 2143.38]  And I've been told that we need to get all these chairs out of the sanctuary.
[2143.54 --> 2145.46]  So what we're going to invite you to do is take that chair,
[2145.56 --> 2147.82]  that practice we've got built into the 11 a.m. service,
[2148.04 --> 2149.82]  and take it straight out to a table,
[2149.98 --> 2152.34]  and then you can grab food and we'll break bread together.
[2153.10 --> 2154.34]  And when you go out there,
[2154.48 --> 2156.50]  there's going to be a whole lot of people who have been serving all morning.
[2156.76 --> 2158.98]  Make sure you thank our hospitality team for their gifts,
[2159.04 --> 2160.16]  because they fill our stomachs.
[2160.16 --> 2161.30]  What an important gift.
[2162.72 --> 2165.44]  I want to read a blessing that comes from Ephesians 3.
[2166.22 --> 2168.36]  And this passage, I feel like, has become the theme verse
[2168.36 --> 2170.08]  of our series on the Holy Spirit.
[2170.70 --> 2171.58]  But this is a prayer.
[2172.16 --> 2176.32]  And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,
[2177.02 --> 2181.30]  may have power, together with all the Lord's people,
[2181.44 --> 2187.08]  to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ.
[2187.08 --> 2191.26]  And to know that this love surpasses knowledge,
[2192.12 --> 2196.36]  that you may be filled to the fullness of God.
[2197.48 --> 2200.36]  Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more
[2200.36 --> 2202.02]  than all we ask or imagine,
[2202.20 --> 2204.84]  according to his power that is at work within us,
[2205.18 --> 2207.00]  to him be the glory in the church,
[2207.44 --> 2210.38]  and in Christ Jesus, throughout all generations.
[2210.86 --> 2213.02]  And together we say, amen.
[2213.54 --> 2214.58]  I think we're going to start,
[2214.68 --> 2216.38]  we're going to sing again the song that we started with,
[2216.38 --> 2218.60]  but let's grab our chairs and we can sing as we go.
[2218.60 --> 2218.74]  Amen.
