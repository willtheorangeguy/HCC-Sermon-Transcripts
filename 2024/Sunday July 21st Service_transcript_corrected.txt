[0.00 → 9.96] good morning brothers and sisters
[9.96 → 14.24] it's good to be up here preaching again
[14.24 → 15.30] I think it's been a year
[15.30 → 17.60] it's good to be able to spend
[17.60 → 20.36] time with you from the front
[20.36 → 22.52] every time I come
[22.52 → 24.60] I see new people, and I'm embarrassed
[24.60 → 26.58] because I'm way four or five
[26.58 → 28.20] months of the year and I come back and
[28.20 → 30.46] oh you're new yeah we've been here
[30.46 → 31.04] three years
[31.04 → 34.06] so I apologize
[34.06 → 36.32] if I say that to you
[36.32 → 38.02] sometime on the way through
[38.02 → 41.92] this morning
[41.92 → 45.06] the living Christ
[45.06 → 47.96] the exalted
[47.96 → 49.74] powerful
[49.74 → 52.10] gracious Christ
[52.10 → 54.18] comes to us
[54.18 → 56.34] and use the
[56.34 → 57.32] beautiful imagery
[57.32 → 59.32] of many of some of the
[59.32 → 59.94] reformers
[59.94 → 61.48] he comes to us
[61.48 → 62.50] clothed
[62.50 → 65.14] first in his word
[65.14 → 67.42] and second he comes
[67.42 → 68.32] clothed
[68.32 → 70.36] in the bread and the wine
[70.36 → 72.78] not just words
[72.78 → 74.66] not just elements
[74.66 → 76.18] but Christ
[76.18 → 77.18] himself
[77.18 → 79.18] by the spirit
[79.18 → 80.54] comes to us
[80.54 → 82.90] and offers life
[82.90 → 84.70] and that should
[84.70 → 85.80] give us
[85.80 → 86.64] a deep
[86.64 → 87.46] sense of
[87.46 → 88.64] expectation
[88.64 → 90.38] and I feel
[90.38 → 90.98] sometimes
[90.98 → 91.46] that our
[91.46 → 92.46] the whole worship
[92.46 → 92.96] service
[92.96 → 94.02] not just at the end
[94.02 → 94.88] when we do the blessing
[94.88 → 95.68] but the whole worship
[95.68 → 96.56] service should be
[96.56 → 97.68] us holding out our
[97.68 → 98.16] hands
[98.16 → 100.18] to receive
[100.18 → 101.00] Christ
[101.00 → 102.38] as he comes to us
[102.38 → 103.28] in prayer
[103.28 → 104.40] in song
[104.40 → 105.98] in bread and wine
[105.98 → 107.04] and in words
[107.04 → 111.52] I had a
[111.52 → 112.66] great idea
[112.66 → 113.72] to start this
[113.72 → 114.00] sermon
[114.00 → 114.84] but it didn't
[114.84 → 115.28] work
[115.28 → 116.90] in the nine
[116.90 → 117.68] o'clock service
[117.68 → 118.80] so I'm not going to
[118.80 → 119.68] try it this time
[119.68 → 121.92] and that was
[121.92 → 122.46] I was going to
[122.46 → 122.92] start
[122.92 → 124.14] with the rolling
[124.14 → 124.62] stones
[124.62 → 126.66] I was going to
[126.66 → 127.08] start with
[127.08 → 128.24] I can't get
[128.24 → 129.42] no satisfaction
[129.42 → 131.32] took a while
[131.32 → 132.20] for the song
[132.20 → 133.04] to finally come on
[133.04 → 133.62] and when it did
[133.62 → 134.10] you could hardly
[134.10 → 134.66] hear it
[134.66 → 136.88] so I'm not going
[136.88 → 138.20] to start that way
[138.20 → 139.20] I'm just going to
[139.20 → 140.02] tell you about the
[140.02 → 140.74] song because all of
[140.74 → 141.48] you know about it
[141.48 → 143.42] in 1965
[143.42 → 146.34] it became a hit
[146.34 → 147.18] on both sides
[147.18 → 147.76] of the ocean
[147.76 → 149.20] the Rolling Stones
[149.20 → 150.10] moved from
[150.10 → 151.58] not being known
[151.58 → 152.46] very well
[152.46 → 153.44] right to be the
[153.44 → 154.08] second group
[154.08 → 154.98] behind the Beatles
[154.98 → 157.36] and the song
[157.36 → 158.62] as you know
[158.62 → 160.46] says I can't
[160.46 → 161.88] get no satisfaction
[161.88 → 163.78] and I've tried
[163.78 → 164.82] and I've tried
[164.82 → 166.16] and I've tried
[166.16 → 167.14] and it's like
[167.14 → 168.08] the song is
[168.08 → 169.38] mirroring the
[169.38 → 170.42] dissatisfaction
[170.42 → 171.62] as it begins
[171.62 → 172.86] with a wistful voice
[172.86 → 173.66] I can't get
[173.66 → 174.66] no satisfaction
[174.66 → 175.96] and then builds
[175.96 → 176.64] in harmony
[176.64 → 177.30] and intensity
[177.30 → 178.28] and I've tried
[178.28 → 179.06] and I've tried
[179.06 → 180.04] until Jagger
[180.04 → 180.38] shouts
[180.38 → 181.52] I can't get
[181.52 → 181.88] no
[181.88 → 184.22] he's expressing
[184.22 → 185.94] the inability
[185.94 → 187.12] for him to find
[187.12 → 188.28] satisfaction
[188.28 → 189.92] and the first verse
[189.92 → 191.20] he talks about
[191.20 → 191.94] the consumer
[191.94 → 192.48] lifestyle
[192.48 → 193.08] and the way
[193.08 → 194.26] ads are selling
[194.26 → 194.82] him life
[194.82 → 195.46] and how that
[195.46 → 196.00] doesn't bring
[196.00 → 196.42] life
[196.42 → 197.42] then in the
[197.42 → 198.02] second verse
[198.02 → 198.82] he talks about
[198.82 → 200.28] his desire
[200.28 → 201.00] to find
[201.00 → 202.18] life in sex
[202.18 → 203.20] and in his
[203.20 → 203.62] touring
[203.62 → 204.20] and he can't
[204.20 → 204.94] find it there
[204.94 → 205.30] either
[205.30 → 206.38] and it just
[206.38 → 206.94] grows
[206.94 → 207.66] and it ends
[207.66 → 208.06] with that
[208.06 → 208.70] intensity
[208.70 → 209.62] I can't get
[209.62 → 210.82] no satisfaction
[210.82 → 212.74] and I've often
[212.74 → 213.64] thought of that
[213.64 → 214.26] song
[214.26 → 215.84] as an anthem
[215.84 → 217.80] of our consumer
[217.80 → 218.32] culture
[218.32 → 220.42] as the cultural
[220.42 → 221.88] cry of the
[221.88 → 222.30] heart
[222.30 → 224.24] because human
[224.24 → 224.98] beings
[224.98 → 226.40] are made
[226.40 → 226.76] with an
[226.76 → 227.88] insatiable
[227.88 → 228.82] thirst
[228.82 → 230.14] for life
[230.14 → 231.18] we're made
[231.18 → 231.86] that way
[231.86 → 233.12] by God
[233.12 → 234.88] and we long
[234.88 → 235.92] to feel that
[235.92 → 236.44] sense of
[236.44 → 237.54] satisfaction
[237.54 → 238.74] and fulfillment
[238.74 → 240.22] of joy
[240.22 → 241.22] and happiness
[241.22 → 242.86] and contentment
[242.86 → 243.74] that's how
[243.74 → 244.50] we're made
[244.50 → 245.20] by God
[245.20 → 247.36] and all
[247.36 → 248.02] the traditions
[248.02 → 248.34] of the
[248.34 → 248.94] reformation
[248.94 → 249.78] began their
[249.78 → 250.42] catechism
[250.42 → 250.96] with some
[250.96 → 251.42] way of
[251.42 → 252.18] speaking of
[252.18 → 253.32] that man's
[253.32 → 253.94] supreme
[253.94 → 254.56] goal
[254.56 → 255.36] his chief
[255.36 → 255.92] end
[255.92 → 257.08] is God
[257.08 → 258.84] and only
[258.84 → 259.56] there can
[259.56 → 259.96] he finds
[259.96 → 260.70] the life
[260.70 → 262.00] that God
[262.00 → 262.50] means
[262.50 → 263.10] for him
[263.10 → 263.90] and her
[263.90 → 264.34] to have
[264.34 → 266.64] it can't
[266.64 → 267.54] be satisfied
[267.54 → 269.46] with consumer
[269.46 → 269.92] goods
[269.92 → 271.42] houses
[271.42 → 272.78] cars
[272.78 → 274.18] toys
[274.18 → 275.62] clothes
[275.62 → 277.18] it can't
[277.18 → 278.02] be satisfied
[278.02 → 279.36] with consumer
[279.36 → 280.36] experiences
[280.36 → 281.54] travel
[281.54 → 283.12] sex
[283.12 → 284.70] gaming
[284.70 → 286.12] sports
[286.12 → 287.48] entertainment
[287.48 → 288.82] music
[288.82 → 290.56] social media
[290.56 → 291.78] cruises
[291.78 → 293.64] all of those
[293.64 → 294.40] things may
[294.40 → 295.16] bring a
[295.16 → 295.90] degree
[295.90 → 297.86] of satisfaction
[297.86 → 298.30] and a
[298.30 → 299.00] degree of
[299.00 → 299.38] joy
[299.38 → 300.44] because God
[300.44 → 300.92] is good
[300.92 → 301.30] God
[301.30 → 301.62] and he's
[301.62 → 302.24] given so
[302.24 → 303.00] much life
[303.00 → 303.42] into his
[303.42 → 303.96] creation
[303.96 → 304.56] for us
[304.56 → 305.14] to delight
[305.14 → 305.38] in
[305.38 → 305.92] but in
[305.92 → 306.48] the end
[306.48 → 308.36] we're left
[308.36 → 308.58] with
[308.58 → 309.66] Mick Jagger
[309.66 → 310.30] I can't
[310.30 → 310.68] get
[310.68 → 311.34] no
[311.34 → 312.10] satisfaction
[312.10 → 313.66] because we're
[313.66 → 314.34] looking in
[314.34 → 315.06] the wrong
[315.06 → 315.94] place
[315.94 → 317.06] we're looking
[317.06 → 317.46] in the
[317.46 → 317.90] goodness
[317.90 → 318.84] of creation
[318.84 → 320.46] rather than
[320.46 → 320.74] in the
[320.74 → 321.26] creator
[321.26 → 322.60] and the
[322.60 → 322.90] Bible
[322.90 → 323.96] calls that
[323.96 → 324.98] as the
[324.98 → 325.56] primal
[325.56 → 326.14] sin
[326.14 → 327.90] idolatry
[327.90 → 329.28] looking
[329.28 → 329.94] to the
[329.94 → 330.52] creation
[330.52 → 331.92] to give
[331.92 → 331.94] to give
[331.94 → 332.38] what only
[332.38 → 332.78] God
[332.78 → 333.18] was meant
[333.18 → 333.70] to give
[333.70 → 335.38] and
[335.38 → 336.22] Jeremiah
[336.22 → 337.14] has a
[337.14 → 337.30] very
[337.30 → 337.84] beautiful
[337.84 → 338.56] picture
[338.56 → 340.00] for a
[340.00 → 341.18] world
[341.18 → 342.02] of his
[342.02 → 342.38] day
[342.38 → 343.18] maybe it's
[343.18 → 343.84] harder for us
[343.84 → 344.10] in a
[344.10 → 344.54] technocratic
[344.54 → 344.94] culture
[344.94 → 345.54] to understand
[345.54 → 346.62] but he's
[346.62 → 346.88] got this
[346.88 → 347.28] beautiful
[347.28 → 347.74] picture
[347.74 → 347.98] where he
[347.98 → 348.30] says
[348.30 → 349.32] Israel
[349.32 → 350.40] has
[350.40 → 351.20] forsaken
[351.20 → 352.02] me
[352.02 → 353.54] the spring
[353.54 → 353.96] of living
[353.96 → 354.42] water
[354.42 → 355.46] and have
[355.46 → 356.10] dug their
[356.10 → 356.46] own
[356.46 → 357.40] cisterns
[357.40 → 358.04] broken
[358.04 → 359.32] cisterns
[359.32 → 360.26] that cannot
[360.26 → 361.04] hold water
[361.04 → 362.88] he pictures
[362.88 → 364.36] this spring
[364.36 → 364.84] of living
[364.84 → 365.26] water
[365.26 → 365.72] that there's
[365.72 → 366.66] all kinds
[366.66 → 367.24] of water
[367.24 → 367.78] available
[367.78 → 369.50] but Israel
[369.50 → 369.96] has turned
[369.96 → 370.44] their back
[370.44 → 370.88] on it
[370.88 → 371.44] and in
[371.44 → 372.10] the dry
[372.10 → 372.84] dusty
[372.84 → 373.42] ground
[373.42 → 374.02] have built
[374.02 → 374.44] these
[374.44 → 375.36] cisterns
[375.36 → 376.08] and these
[376.08 → 376.62] cisterns
[376.62 → 377.26] are leaky
[377.26 → 377.70] and they're
[377.70 → 378.18] dusty
[378.18 → 378.52] and they
[378.52 → 378.94] can't hold
[378.94 → 379.34] water
[379.34 → 379.82] and they're
[379.82 → 380.42] trying to
[380.42 → 380.92] satisfy
[380.92 → 381.36] themselves
[381.36 → 382.10] with water
[382.10 → 383.14] and ignoring
[383.14 → 383.96] this huge
[383.96 → 384.54] spring
[384.54 → 385.62] over there
[385.62 → 388.24] and this
[388.24 → 388.86] is a picture
[388.86 → 389.20] of our
[389.20 → 389.68] culture
[389.68 → 391.54] poor
[391.54 → 392.24] Mick Jagger
[392.24 → 393.68] but he
[393.68 → 394.40] expresses
[394.40 → 395.64] I think
[395.64 → 396.32] the cultural
[396.32 → 397.02] cry
[397.02 → 397.30] of a
[397.30 → 397.70] consumer
[397.70 → 398.30] culture
[398.30 → 398.98] I can't
[398.98 → 399.34] get
[399.34 → 400.38] no
[400.38 → 401.18] satisfaction
[401.18 → 402.42] the
[402.42 → 402.88] contemporary
[402.88 → 403.48] testimony
[403.48 → 404.72] the testimony
[404.72 → 405.90] of the
[405.90 → 406.16] Christian
[406.16 → 406.54] Reformed
[406.54 → 407.04] Church
[407.04 → 408.10] says this
[408.10 → 408.48] and I think
[408.48 → 408.66] there's
[408.66 → 409.06] beautiful
[409.06 → 409.62] words
[409.62 → 410.70] looking
[410.70 → 411.48] for life
[411.48 → 411.80] without
[411.80 → 412.34] God
[412.34 → 414.28] we find
[414.28 → 414.62] only
[414.62 → 415.10] death
[415.10 → 416.80] pursuing
[416.80 → 417.48] pleasure
[417.48 → 419.40] we lose
[419.40 → 420.90] the gift
[420.90 → 422.20] of joy
[422.20 → 424.70] we all
[424.70 → 425.44] want life
[425.44 → 426.64] and we're
[426.64 → 427.34] made
[427.34 → 428.22] for life
[428.22 → 429.48] and there's
[429.48 → 429.98] no better
[429.98 → 430.58] place
[430.58 → 431.22] to come
[431.22 → 431.92] in scripture
[431.92 → 433.28] than John's
[433.28 → 433.78] gospel
[433.78 → 435.44] because that's
[435.44 → 435.86] what his
[435.86 → 436.90] whole gospel
[436.90 → 437.70] is concerned
[437.70 → 438.10] with
[438.10 → 439.58] the word
[439.58 → 440.44] life is found
[440.44 → 441.46] almost 50
[441.46 → 442.34] times
[442.34 → 443.16] in 21
[443.16 → 443.68] chapters
[443.68 → 445.58] he's concerned
[445.58 → 446.18] with life
[446.18 → 447.18] but what we have
[447.18 → 447.52] to say
[447.52 → 448.66] right up front
[448.66 → 450.12] is that this
[450.12 → 450.92] life he is
[450.92 → 451.64] describing
[451.64 → 452.90] as has been
[452.90 → 453.88] often misunderstood
[453.88 → 455.18] is not
[455.18 → 456.14] heaven
[456.14 → 458.02] even in the
[458.02 → 458.90] text for this
[458.90 → 459.50] morning in
[459.50 → 460.28] John 6
[460.28 → 461.88] this life
[461.88 → 462.36] that he is
[462.36 → 463.18] describing is
[463.18 → 464.48] I will raise
[464.48 → 465.42] him up
[465.42 → 466.22] on the last
[466.22 → 466.64] day
[466.64 → 467.38] it's the
[467.38 → 468.10] resurrection
[468.10 → 468.96] life
[468.96 → 469.98] it's bodily
[469.98 → 470.78] life
[470.78 → 472.26] the bodily
[472.26 → 473.02] life that we
[473.02 → 473.66] were meant to
[473.66 → 474.18] live in
[474.18 → 475.00] Genesis 1
[475.00 → 476.02] the bodily
[476.02 → 477.02] life that was
[477.02 → 478.54] twisted by sin
[478.54 → 479.08] as we turned
[479.08 → 479.90] away from God
[479.90 → 481.08] and that bodily
[481.08 → 482.20] life that God
[482.20 → 483.02] is going to
[483.02 → 483.70] restore
[483.70 → 484.78] one day
[484.78 → 485.30] at the
[485.30 → 485.74] resurrection
[485.74 → 486.54] that's how
[486.54 → 487.36] John is
[487.36 → 487.72] thinking
[487.72 → 488.50] and if you
[488.50 → 489.28] said to him
[489.28 → 490.02] when you talk
[490.02 → 490.52] about eternal
[490.52 → 491.16] life are you
[491.16 → 491.80] talking about
[491.80 → 492.86] heaven he'd
[492.86 → 494.32] say really
[494.32 → 495.20] you think that
[495.20 → 496.48] he says that's
[496.48 → 497.10] what the pagans
[497.10 → 497.86] around us think
[497.86 → 498.48] but that's not
[498.48 → 499.12] what we Jews
[499.12 → 500.12] think we think
[500.12 → 500.72] God is going to
[500.72 → 501.36] restore this
[501.36 → 502.32] creation in our
[502.32 → 503.04] bodily life
[503.04 → 504.50] that's the life
[504.50 → 505.88] that John is
[505.88 → 506.48] talking about
[506.48 → 507.00] and the good
[507.00 → 508.28] news is what
[508.28 → 509.00] the Jews were
[509.00 → 509.64] expecting
[509.64 → 510.24] resurrection
[510.24 → 511.86] life has
[511.86 → 512.36] come in
[512.36 → 513.66] Jesus but the
[513.66 → 514.74] good news gets
[514.74 → 516.06] better and that
[516.06 → 517.10] is that not only
[517.10 → 518.10] will we experience
[518.10 → 518.82] when we're raised
[518.82 → 519.66] up on the last
[519.66 → 520.68] day but that
[520.68 → 521.84] life can come
[521.84 → 523.54] to us right
[523.54 → 524.94] now and we
[524.94 → 525.42] can already
[525.42 → 526.60] begin to taste
[526.60 → 526.88] it
[526.88 → 529.90] one of the good
[529.90 → 530.56] things about the
[530.56 → 531.48] Gospel of John
[531.48 → 532.48] is he gives us
[532.48 → 534.08] the purpose of
[534.08 → 535.06] why he writes
[535.06 → 536.38] in John 20
[536.38 → 537.38] 31
[537.38 → 539.38] he says I
[539.38 → 539.82] took a bunch
[539.82 → 540.64] of signs and I
[540.64 → 541.34] chose some of
[541.34 → 541.82] them and here's
[541.82 → 542.40] why I wrote
[542.40 → 542.82] this
[542.82 → 544.18] these things
[544.18 → 544.78] are written
[544.78 → 546.10] that you may
[546.10 → 547.36] believe that
[547.36 → 548.32] Jesus is the
[548.32 → 549.34] Messiah the
[549.34 → 550.12] Son of God
[550.12 → 550.86] and that by
[550.86 → 552.02] believing you
[552.02 → 552.86] might have
[552.86 → 554.56] life in his
[554.56 → 554.92] name
[554.92 → 557.20] very simple
[557.20 → 558.78] very simple
[558.78 → 559.70] John 6
[559.70 → 561.56] for a child
[561.56 → 562.26] I could say
[562.26 → 563.08] John 6
[563.08 → 563.96] says this
[563.96 → 564.98] you want
[564.98 → 565.48] life
[565.48 → 566.66] Jesus
[566.66 → 567.66] will give
[567.66 → 568.04] it
[568.04 → 570.16] whole gospel
[570.16 → 571.32] you want
[571.32 → 571.80] life
[571.80 → 573.06] Jesus will
[573.06 → 573.38] give it
[573.38 → 574.24] chapter after
[574.24 → 575.14] chapter after
[575.14 → 575.66] chapter
[575.66 → 577.70] but John
[577.70 → 578.50] is also
[578.50 → 580.20] one of the
[580.20 → 580.94] most if not
[580.94 → 581.50] the most
[581.50 → 582.94] complex book
[582.94 → 583.50] in the entire
[583.50 → 584.14] New Testament
[584.14 → 586.02] Dave reminded
[586.02 → 586.80] me of
[586.80 → 588.74] the quote
[588.74 → 589.54] from a guy
[589.54 → 590.22] named Brunei
[590.22 → 590.86] wrote a book
[590.86 → 591.40] on John
[591.40 → 591.90] he says
[591.90 → 592.68] John
[592.68 → 593.54] the book of
[593.54 → 594.24] John is so
[594.24 → 595.18] shallow a child
[595.18 → 596.20] can swim in it
[596.20 → 597.52] and so deep
[597.52 → 598.14] it can drown
[598.14 → 598.60] an elephant
[598.60 → 600.16] and there are
[600.16 → 601.66] many people
[601.66 → 601.94] who said
[601.94 → 602.60] something like
[602.60 → 603.24] that you
[603.24 → 604.94] can spend
[604.94 → 606.20] your whole life
[606.20 → 606.98] in one chapter
[606.98 → 607.62] of John
[607.62 → 608.50] and never
[608.50 → 609.58] begin to get
[609.58 → 610.22] all everything
[610.22 → 610.80] that's there
[610.80 → 612.28] and that's how
[612.28 → 613.24] I felt as I
[613.24 → 614.02] worked on John
[614.02 → 614.82] 6 this week
[614.82 → 615.72] I didn't want
[615.72 → 616.64] to drown
[616.64 → 617.42] not elephants
[617.42 → 618.48] but all of you
[618.48 → 620.00] I didn't want
[620.00 → 620.74] you drowning
[620.74 → 621.54] in the depth
[621.54 → 622.52] of John 6
[622.52 → 623.56] but I wanted
[623.56 → 624.28] to take you
[624.28 → 625.40] beyond Jesus
[625.40 → 626.20] gives life
[626.20 → 628.54] and so
[628.54 → 629.36] if you'd like
[629.36 → 630.46] to peel back
[630.46 → 631.06] maybe only
[631.06 → 631.88] one or two
[631.88 → 632.68] of these layers
[632.68 → 634.34] of John 6
[634.34 → 636.04] I want to
[636.04 → 636.70] invite you
[636.70 → 637.48] to enter
[637.48 → 638.50] the Jewish
[638.50 → 639.58] world with me
[639.58 → 640.74] you're going
[640.74 → 641.02] to have to
[641.02 → 641.48] leave your
[641.48 → 642.02] world of
[642.02 → 642.58] Vancouver
[642.58 → 643.44] of Surrey
[643.44 → 643.92] of BC
[643.92 → 644.94] behind for a
[644.94 → 645.24] moment
[645.24 → 646.80] because John
[646.80 → 647.64] doesn't think
[647.64 → 648.16] like you
[648.16 → 649.50] the Jews
[649.50 → 650.24] don't think
[650.24 → 650.80] like you
[650.80 → 651.84] and you're
[651.84 → 652.28] going to have
[652.28 → 652.94] to enter
[652.94 → 654.54] into a strange
[654.54 → 655.14] world
[655.14 → 656.56] the world
[656.56 → 657.52] to which
[657.52 → 658.16] John is
[658.16 → 658.52] thinking
[658.52 → 659.12] and if you
[659.12 → 659.76] can enter
[659.76 → 660.26] into this
[660.26 → 660.68] world
[660.68 → 661.76] you'll begin
[661.76 → 662.34] to see
[662.34 → 663.12] a little bit
[663.12 → 664.20] more of the
[664.20 → 664.90] depth
[664.90 → 667.04] of John 6
[667.04 → 667.72] as we look
[667.72 → 668.14] at it
[668.14 → 670.78] the first
[670.78 → 671.62] 12 chapters
[671.62 → 672.38] of John
[672.38 → 673.18] have recalled
[673.18 → 673.72] by almost
[673.72 → 674.52] all scholars
[674.52 → 675.28] the book
[675.28 → 676.48] of signs
[676.48 → 678.30] we're told
[678.30 → 678.98] that John
[678.98 → 679.78] tells us
[679.78 → 680.52] that he chose
[680.52 → 681.28] six of those
[681.28 → 681.86] signs
[681.86 → 682.36] signs
[682.36 → 683.38] all of them
[683.38 → 684.48] that picture
[684.48 → 685.24] Jesus
[685.24 → 686.16] as the
[686.16 → 686.52] giver
[686.52 → 687.26] of life
[687.26 → 689.00] and what
[689.00 → 689.58] the way
[689.58 → 690.02] that
[690.02 → 690.78] unfolds
[690.78 → 691.34] the gospel
[691.34 → 691.74] is very
[691.74 → 692.18] clear
[692.18 → 693.52] there's a
[693.52 → 693.94] sing
[693.94 → 695.36] then there's
[695.36 → 695.74] a lot of
[695.74 → 696.32] teaching
[696.32 → 696.96] that helps
[696.96 → 697.70] us understand
[697.70 → 698.50] that sign
[698.50 → 699.56] and then
[699.56 → 700.62] people respond
[700.62 → 701.08] either in
[701.08 → 701.70] faith or
[701.70 → 702.36] unbelief
[702.36 → 703.44] and then a
[703.44 → 704.16] second sign
[704.16 → 705.02] a lot of
[705.02 → 705.58] teaching that
[705.58 → 705.92] tell us
[705.92 → 706.32] about the
[706.32 → 706.74] sign
[706.74 → 707.74] and then
[707.74 → 708.86] the response
[708.86 → 709.38] of faith
[709.38 → 710.18] and unbelief
[710.18 → 711.56] and that
[711.56 → 712.36] this is how
[712.36 → 713.10] the gospel
[713.10 → 713.64] of John
[713.64 → 714.22] unfolds
[714.22 → 714.56] and this is
[714.56 → 715.08] how John
[715.08 → 715.88] 6
[715.88 → 717.26] unfolds
[717.26 → 718.52] we have
[718.52 → 719.06] a fourth
[719.06 → 719.62] sign
[719.62 → 721.08] and that
[721.08 → 721.68] sign
[721.68 → 722.46] begins
[722.46 → 722.86] with the
[722.86 → 723.18] feeding
[723.18 → 723.76] of the
[723.76 → 724.52] 5,000
[724.52 → 725.02] if you could
[725.02 → 725.30] put up
[725.30 → 725.92] that outline
[725.92 → 727.54] it begins
[727.54 → 727.92] with the
[727.92 → 728.36] feeding of
[728.36 → 729.24] the 5,000
[729.24 → 730.76] and then
[730.76 → 731.88] the teaching
[731.88 → 733.08] that explains
[733.08 → 734.06] that sign
[734.06 → 735.32] and then
[735.32 → 736.08] finally
[736.08 → 737.02] there is
[737.02 → 737.74] division
[737.74 → 738.98] as there
[738.98 → 739.94] is response
[739.94 → 741.60] to that
[741.60 → 742.06] teaching
[742.06 → 743.08] and that's
[743.08 → 743.34] how the
[743.34 → 743.70] book
[743.70 → 745.08] unfolds
[745.08 → 746.78] it begins
[746.78 → 747.48] with the
[747.48 → 748.12] sign
[748.12 → 748.60] of the
[748.60 → 748.98] feeding
[748.98 → 749.48] of the
[749.48 → 750.28] 5,000
[750.28 → 752.04] all of you
[752.04 → 752.48] know that
[752.48 → 752.92] sign
[752.92 → 753.54] there you
[753.54 → 753.78] go
[753.78 → 755.00] all of you
[755.00 → 755.34] know that
[755.34 → 755.72] sign
[755.72 → 756.32] it's recorded
[756.32 → 756.76] in all the
[756.76 → 757.36] gospels
[757.36 → 758.80] Jesus takes
[758.80 → 759.34] the bread
[759.34 → 759.78] of a young
[759.78 → 760.14] boy
[760.14 → 760.48] and he
[760.48 → 761.32] feeds them
[761.32 → 762.90] but what I
[762.90 → 763.34] want to do
[763.34 → 763.80] is I want
[763.80 → 764.32] you to see
[764.32 → 765.24] how John
[765.24 → 766.76] frames
[766.76 → 768.06] this
[768.06 → 768.92] particular
[768.92 → 769.60] sign
[769.60 → 770.56] because when
[770.56 → 770.90] you see
[770.90 → 771.26] how he
[771.26 → 772.12] frames it
[772.12 → 773.06] you see
[773.06 → 774.02] the clue
[774.02 → 774.60] he's giving
[774.60 → 775.36] you how
[775.36 → 776.02] he wants
[776.02 → 776.40] you to
[776.40 → 777.00] read
[777.00 → 777.98] the meaning
[777.98 → 778.40] of this
[778.40 → 778.80] sign
[778.80 → 780.58] in the
[780.58 → 781.10] first
[781.10 → 781.60] in verse
[781.60 → 782.14] 4
[782.14 → 783.14] he mentions
[783.14 → 783.38] the
[783.38 → 783.84] Passover
[783.84 → 784.22] he says
[784.22 → 784.96] the Jewish
[784.96 → 785.98] Passover
[785.98 → 787.02] festival
[787.02 → 788.48] was near
[788.48 → 790.80] that Passover
[790.80 → 792.30] was critical
[792.30 → 792.94] for John
[792.94 → 793.70] he has
[793.70 → 794.08] three
[794.08 → 794.76] Passovers
[794.76 → 795.08] in his
[795.08 → 795.50] gospel
[795.50 → 796.00] John
[796.00 → 796.42] 2
[796.42 → 796.82] this
[796.82 → 797.02] one
[797.02 → 797.40] here
[797.40 → 798.08] and Jesus
[798.08 → 798.56] dies
[798.56 → 798.82] in the
[798.82 → 799.24] Passover
[799.24 → 800.16] and every
[800.16 → 800.64] case
[800.64 → 800.96] he's
[800.96 → 801.34] showing
[801.34 → 801.84] that this
[801.84 → 802.56] rich
[802.56 → 803.28] feast
[803.28 → 804.04] is fulfilled
[804.04 → 804.68] in Jesus
[804.68 → 806.54] but to
[806.54 → 807.36] understand
[807.36 → 807.64] this
[807.64 → 807.90] you're going
[807.90 → 808.12] to have
[808.12 → 808.88] to understand
[808.88 → 809.20] what's
[809.20 → 809.88] going on
[809.88 → 810.44] in John's
[810.44 → 810.80] world
[810.80 → 811.64] because
[811.64 → 812.80] the Passover
[812.80 → 813.76] is kind
[813.76 → 814.08] of like
[814.08 → 814.68] Christmas
[814.68 → 815.74] is the
[815.74 → 817.12] primary feast
[817.12 → 817.72] of a consumer
[817.72 → 818.24] culture
[818.24 → 819.76] the primary
[819.76 → 820.30] feast
[820.30 → 821.04] for the Jews
[821.04 → 821.52] was this
[821.52 → 822.06] Passover
[822.06 → 822.18] Passover
[822.18 → 822.92] and
[822.92 → 823.96] Jerusalem
[823.96 → 824.48] would be
[824.48 → 825.32] flooded
[825.32 → 826.04] with people
[826.04 → 827.46] the Romans
[827.46 → 828.40] hated
[828.40 → 829.04] Passover
[829.04 → 829.90] because they
[829.90 → 830.60] knew they
[830.60 → 830.96] were going
[830.96 → 831.26] to be
[831.26 → 832.16] under danger
[832.16 → 832.92] they knew
[832.92 → 833.22] that there
[833.22 → 833.36] would be
[833.36 → 834.00] people dead
[834.00 → 834.54] at the end
[834.54 → 835.20] they knew
[835.20 → 835.56] that there
[835.56 → 835.88] was this
[835.88 → 836.48] revolutionary
[836.48 → 836.98] fervour
[836.98 → 837.36] and they
[837.36 → 837.90] hated
[837.90 → 838.40] Passover
[838.40 → 839.28] but every
[839.28 → 839.80] Passover
[839.80 → 840.98] there was
[840.98 → 841.72] this big
[841.72 → 842.34] event
[842.34 → 843.60] let me try
[843.60 → 844.30] to explain
[844.30 → 844.86] the background
[844.86 → 845.30] to you
[845.30 → 845.62] with the
[845.62 → 846.12] diagram
[846.12 → 849.16] here's how
[849.16 → 849.58] if you
[849.58 → 851.00] get hold
[851.00 → 851.28] of this
[851.28 → 851.70] diagram
[851.70 → 852.00] it can
[852.00 → 852.40] help you
[852.40 → 852.82] understand
[852.82 → 853.78] a ton
[853.78 → 855.20] of what's
[855.20 → 855.86] going on
[855.86 → 856.52] in scripture
[856.52 → 857.20] including the
[857.20 → 857.68] New Testament
[857.68 → 858.60] because Jesus'
[858.92 → 859.98] death is seen
[859.98 → 860.78] ultimately
[860.78 → 862.04] as Passover
[862.04 → 863.08] here's what's
[863.08 → 863.94] going on
[863.94 → 865.40] Israel
[865.40 → 866.86] is in
[866.86 → 867.46] slavery
[867.46 → 868.78] to Egypt
[868.78 → 870.16] yes
[870.16 → 870.86] they're in
[870.86 → 871.40] slavery
[871.40 → 872.34] to the
[872.34 → 872.74] Pharaoh
[872.74 → 874.04] and usually
[874.04 → 874.64] in our
[874.64 → 875.42] secular culture
[875.42 → 875.86] that's where
[875.86 → 876.56] we stop
[876.56 → 877.96] but if you're
[877.96 → 878.72] thinking like a
[878.72 → 878.96] Jew
[878.96 → 879.52] or an ancient
[879.52 → 879.96] near eastern
[879.96 → 880.42] person
[880.42 → 881.16] you realize
[881.16 → 882.00] that Pharaoh
[882.00 → 882.60] is the
[882.60 → 883.88] embodiment
[883.88 → 884.84] of the
[884.84 → 885.28] Egyptian
[885.28 → 885.88] gods
[885.88 → 886.84] and he
[886.84 → 887.50] represents
[887.50 → 888.70] those gods
[888.70 → 889.40] to all
[889.40 → 889.74] that he
[889.74 → 890.58] rules over
[890.58 → 891.28] and so
[891.28 → 892.12] Israel is
[892.12 → 892.98] not simply
[892.98 → 893.82] in political
[893.82 → 894.56] and economic
[894.56 → 895.18] and social
[895.18 → 896.04] bondage
[896.04 → 897.02] but in
[897.02 → 897.84] religious
[897.84 → 898.82] bondage
[898.82 → 899.82] they are
[899.82 → 900.62] serving
[900.62 → 901.74] the Egyptian
[901.74 → 902.78] gods
[902.78 → 903.56] that orient
[903.56 → 904.42] and shape
[904.42 → 905.12] the entire
[905.12 → 906.00] culture
[906.00 → 907.80] and what
[907.80 → 908.46] the exodus
[908.46 → 909.06] is all
[909.06 → 909.40] about
[909.40 → 909.88] is that
[909.88 → 910.62] God
[910.62 → 912.10] calls out
[912.10 → 912.54] Moses
[912.54 → 913.52] and says
[913.52 → 914.84] I want
[914.84 → 915.66] my people
[915.66 → 916.52] back
[916.52 → 917.06] I want
[917.06 → 917.40] them to
[917.40 → 918.28] serve me
[918.28 → 918.90] and not
[918.90 → 919.32] the gods
[919.32 → 919.70] of Egypt
[919.70 → 920.20] I want
[920.20 → 921.16] them liberated
[921.16 → 921.78] from this
[921.78 → 922.56] idolatry
[922.56 → 923.00] when they're
[923.00 → 923.50] liberated
[923.50 → 924.18] they can
[924.18 → 924.64] begin to
[924.64 → 925.28] serve me
[925.28 → 925.66] again
[925.66 → 926.18] they can
[926.18 → 927.14] find life
[927.14 → 927.58] and they
[927.58 → 927.88] can make
[927.88 → 928.50] that life
[928.50 → 929.00] known
[929.00 → 929.50] to the
[929.50 → 929.88] world
[929.88 → 931.26] and so
[931.26 → 932.02] Moses is
[932.02 → 932.36] sent
[932.36 → 932.74] and when
[932.74 → 933.42] he's sent
[933.42 → 934.70] he brings
[934.70 → 935.08] with the
[935.08 → 935.72] ten plagues
[935.72 → 936.16] he brings
[936.16 → 936.74] one
[936.74 → 938.00] powerful
[938.00 → 938.70] plague
[938.70 → 939.30] on one
[939.30 → 939.84] god
[939.84 → 940.36] after the
[940.36 → 940.64] other
[940.64 → 941.72] and judges
[941.72 → 942.12] them
[942.12 → 943.26] he says
[943.26 → 943.88] you think
[943.88 → 944.32] there's a
[944.32 → 945.04] frog god
[945.04 → 945.52] okay
[945.52 → 946.02] have some
[946.02 → 946.38] more
[946.38 → 947.34] you think
[947.34 → 947.80] there's a
[947.80 → 948.46] cow god
[948.46 → 948.90] let's see
[948.90 → 949.20] what they
[949.20 → 949.70] can do
[949.70 → 950.36] and he
[950.36 → 950.82] goes through
[950.82 → 951.28] all the
[951.28 → 951.66] gods
[951.66 → 952.32] and attacks
[952.32 → 952.80] each of
[952.80 → 952.90] them
[952.90 → 953.72] until finally
[953.72 → 954.38] the last
[954.38 → 954.82] god
[954.82 → 955.46] the sun
[955.46 → 955.72] god
[955.72 → 956.00] Ray
[956.00 → 956.20] says
[956.20 → 956.52] you think
[956.52 → 956.80] that's
[956.80 → 957.18] a god
[957.18 → 958.14] walks
[958.14 → 958.48] him out
[958.48 → 959.98] and we're
[959.98 → 960.48] told in
[960.48 → 960.92] exodus
[960.92 → 961.32] 12
[961.32 → 961.62] 12
[961.62 → 962.24] that god
[962.24 → 962.64] brings
[962.64 → 963.42] judgment
[963.42 → 964.94] on the
[964.94 → 965.38] gods
[965.38 → 966.04] he's
[966.04 → 966.68] liberating
[966.68 → 967.38] Israel
[967.38 → 967.78] from
[967.78 → 968.48] idolatry
[968.48 → 968.82] that they
[968.82 → 969.18] might
[969.18 → 969.80] find
[969.80 → 970.30] life
[970.30 → 971.42] and now
[971.42 → 971.78] when they
[971.78 → 972.34] serve
[972.34 → 972.78] the living
[972.78 → 973.26] god
[973.26 → 974.78] they find
[974.78 → 975.14] what is
[975.14 → 975.42] life
[975.42 → 975.88] indeed
[975.88 → 977.36] now as
[977.36 → 977.70] part of
[977.70 → 978.24] the exodus
[978.24 → 979.08] part of
[979.08 → 979.84] that exodus
[979.84 → 980.68] they were
[980.68 → 981.18] liberated
[981.18 → 981.46] from
[981.46 → 982.18] idolatry
[982.18 → 983.22] the rest
[983.22 → 983.52] of the
[983.52 → 983.88] story
[983.88 → 984.66] shows us
[984.66 → 985.24] they
[985.24 → 985.58] couldn't
[985.58 → 986.08] remain
[986.08 → 986.76] liberated
[986.76 → 987.86] they fell
[987.86 → 988.12] under
[988.12 → 988.74] idolatry
[988.74 → 989.16] again
[989.16 → 989.88] and again
[989.88 → 990.52] and again
[990.52 → 991.62] until finally
[991.62 → 992.58] god takes
[992.58 → 993.02] them off
[993.02 → 994.46] the land
[994.46 → 995.30] sends them
[995.30 → 996.08] into exile
[996.08 → 997.58] and Isaiah
[997.58 → 998.56] speaking to
[998.56 → 998.88] them
[998.88 → 1000.32] in exile
[1000.32 → 1001.34] says to
[1001.34 → 1001.66] them
[1001.66 → 1003.14] that exodus
[1003.14 → 1004.28] failed
[1004.28 → 1005.12] to deliver
[1005.12 → 1006.38] and he
[1006.38 → 1006.98] says forget
[1006.98 → 1007.86] that exodus
[1007.86 → 1008.90] says Isaiah
[1008.90 → 1009.68] there's a
[1009.68 → 1010.52] second exodus
[1010.52 → 1010.94] coming
[1010.94 → 1011.94] and that
[1011.94 → 1012.74] second exodus
[1012.74 → 1013.22] I'm going to
[1013.22 → 1013.84] liberate you
[1013.84 → 1014.52] once and
[1014.52 → 1015.32] for all
[1015.32 → 1015.86] and when
[1015.86 → 1016.08] you're
[1016.08 → 1016.64] liberated
[1016.64 → 1017.08] you will
[1017.08 → 1017.94] then finally
[1017.94 → 1019.08] finally be
[1019.08 → 1019.70] freed from
[1019.70 → 1020.48] your idolatry
[1020.48 → 1021.18] to serve
[1021.18 → 1021.94] me
[1021.94 → 1023.16] and so
[1023.16 → 1024.12] this longing
[1024.12 → 1024.88] begins to
[1024.88 → 1025.48] grow
[1025.48 → 1027.06] and every
[1027.06 → 1027.96] passover
[1027.96 → 1028.82] they would
[1028.82 → 1029.70] say okay
[1029.70 → 1030.58] Daniel said
[1030.58 → 1031.14] this day's
[1031.14 → 1031.98] coming soon
[1031.98 → 1032.74] and they
[1032.74 → 1033.34] would start
[1033.34 → 1034.10] to celebrate
[1034.10 → 1035.16] this passover
[1035.16 → 1036.20] god is
[1036.20 → 1037.10] coming back
[1037.10 → 1037.58] and he's
[1037.58 → 1037.84] going to
[1037.84 → 1038.50] deliver us
[1038.50 → 1038.80] and there's
[1038.80 → 1038.96] going to
[1038.96 → 1039.28] be this
[1039.28 → 1040.00] mighty
[1040.00 → 1040.96] second
[1040.96 → 1041.46] exodus
[1041.46 → 1042.12] and they
[1042.12 → 1042.64] and the
[1042.64 → 1043.14] whole thing
[1043.14 → 1043.38] would be
[1043.38 → 1043.58] this
[1043.58 → 1044.36] revolutionary
[1044.36 → 1045.40] fervour
[1045.40 → 1046.68] and it's
[1046.68 → 1047.22] in this
[1047.22 → 1048.16] context
[1048.16 → 1048.98] that they
[1048.98 → 1049.48] would break
[1049.48 → 1049.96] bread
[1049.96 → 1051.30] and they
[1051.30 → 1051.88] would as
[1051.88 → 1052.44] one as
[1052.44 → 1053.48] the rabbi
[1053.48 → 1054.22] Gaelic said
[1054.22 → 1054.96] this bread
[1054.96 → 1056.04] represents
[1056.04 → 1057.10] the bread of
[1057.10 → 1057.84] the passover
[1057.84 → 1058.86] where god
[1058.86 → 1059.46] will one
[1059.46 → 1059.82] day
[1059.82 → 1060.92] bring
[1060.92 → 1061.90] a second
[1061.90 → 1062.46] exodus
[1062.46 → 1064.34] so john
[1064.34 → 1065.44] clues you in
[1065.44 → 1066.22] about this
[1066.22 → 1066.68] bread this
[1066.68 → 1067.48] bread has to
[1067.48 → 1068.58] do with the
[1068.58 → 1068.94] bread of
[1068.94 → 1069.56] passover
[1069.56 → 1070.50] and a
[1070.50 → 1070.98] liberation
[1070.98 → 1071.94] that is
[1071.94 → 1072.40] coming
[1072.40 → 1073.82] for god's
[1073.82 → 1074.18] people
[1074.18 → 1076.32] but then it
[1076.32 → 1076.98] ends
[1076.98 → 1077.94] with verses
[1077.94 → 1078.68] 14 and
[1078.68 → 1079.12] 15
[1079.12 → 1080.50] this is the
[1080.50 → 1081.18] frame
[1081.18 → 1082.54] after they
[1082.54 → 1083.20] see what's
[1083.20 → 1083.70] happened
[1083.70 → 1084.88] what is the
[1084.88 → 1085.36] first thing
[1085.36 → 1085.86] they do
[1085.86 → 1087.02] here's verses
[1087.02 → 1088.24] 14 and
[1088.24 → 1088.68] 15
[1088.68 → 1089.26] when the
[1089.26 → 1089.92] people saw
[1089.92 → 1090.58] the sign
[1090.58 → 1091.52] Jesus performed
[1091.52 → 1092.32] they began
[1092.32 → 1092.58] to say
[1092.58 → 1093.54] surely this
[1093.54 → 1093.84] is the
[1093.84 → 1094.24] prophet
[1094.24 → 1094.66] who is to
[1094.66 → 1094.98] come into
[1094.98 → 1095.48] the world
[1095.48 → 1096.96] Jesus knowing
[1096.96 → 1097.28] that they
[1097.28 → 1097.94] intended to
[1097.94 → 1098.36] come and
[1098.36 → 1098.72] make him
[1098.72 → 1099.30] king by
[1099.30 → 1099.74] force
[1099.74 → 1100.26] withdrew
[1100.26 → 1100.76] again to
[1100.76 → 1101.18] a mountain
[1101.18 → 1101.90] by himself
[1101.90 → 1104.00] why does
[1104.00 → 1104.80] that take
[1104.80 → 1105.30] place
[1105.30 → 1106.96] well if
[1106.96 → 1107.36] you're a Jew
[1107.36 → 1107.64] you know
[1107.64 → 1108.28] exactly why
[1108.28 → 1108.56] it's taking
[1108.56 → 1108.98] place because
[1108.98 → 1109.48] you've probably
[1109.48 → 1110.04] seen it
[1110.04 → 1111.42] 12 times
[1111.42 → 1111.76] in your
[1111.76 → 1112.30] lifetime
[1112.30 → 1114.16] what happened
[1114.16 → 1114.98] is Moses
[1114.98 → 1115.82] was that
[1115.82 → 1116.86] mighty prophet
[1116.86 → 1118.06] and he did
[1118.06 → 1119.02] many mighty
[1119.02 → 1120.22] deeds and
[1120.22 → 1120.80] those mighty
[1120.80 → 1121.76] deeds showed
[1121.76 → 1122.34] that he was
[1122.34 → 1123.24] sent by god
[1123.24 → 1124.36] and they were
[1124.36 → 1125.64] looking for
[1125.64 → 1126.66] another prophet
[1126.66 → 1128.10] who would
[1128.10 → 1129.02] become king
[1129.02 → 1130.04] and would do
[1130.04 → 1131.04] mighty deeds
[1131.04 → 1131.66] to deliver
[1131.66 → 1132.56] them from
[1132.56 → 1132.94] Rome
[1132.94 → 1133.98] there's a
[1133.98 → 1135.02] story right
[1135.02 → 1135.48] around the
[1135.48 → 1135.90] time that
[1135.90 → 1136.30] john is
[1136.30 → 1137.22] writing of
[1137.22 → 1137.76] a man
[1137.76 → 1138.46] named
[1138.46 → 1139.30] thuds
[1139.30 → 1140.38] he may or
[1140.38 → 1140.64] may not
[1140.64 → 1140.92] be the
[1140.92 → 1141.20] guy in
[1141.20 → 1141.82] acts 5
[1141.82 → 1143.46] but thuds
[1143.46 → 1145.22] basically
[1145.22 → 1145.74] called
[1145.74 → 1146.30] Israel and
[1146.30 → 1147.08] said i
[1147.08 → 1147.60] am sent
[1147.60 → 1147.98] as this
[1147.98 → 1148.92] final prophet
[1148.92 → 1149.78] to do
[1149.78 → 1150.82] what Moses
[1150.82 → 1151.78] could not
[1151.78 → 1152.96] do and
[1152.96 → 1153.42] he got a
[1153.42 → 1154.46] great gathering
[1154.46 → 1154.88] and he went
[1154.88 → 1155.46] down to the
[1155.46 → 1156.14] Jordan River
[1156.14 → 1156.74] and he says
[1156.74 → 1157.12] I'm going to
[1157.12 → 1157.62] do a mighty
[1157.62 → 1158.22] deed and I'm
[1158.22 → 1158.44] going to
[1158.44 → 1159.18] split the
[1159.18 → 1159.82] Jordan River
[1159.82 → 1160.70] the same way
[1160.70 → 1161.22] that Moses
[1161.22 → 1162.02] did and when
[1162.02 → 1162.74] he split that
[1162.74 → 1163.16] river we're
[1163.16 → 1163.58] going to walk
[1163.58 → 1164.04] through it and
[1164.04 → 1164.34] we're going to
[1164.34 → 1164.84] defeat the
[1164.84 → 1165.32] Romans
[1165.32 → 1166.86] well he never
[1166.86 → 1167.34] got to the
[1167.34 → 1167.72] river the
[1167.72 → 1168.28] Romans caught
[1168.28 → 1168.72] wind of it
[1168.72 → 1169.20] caught him
[1169.20 → 1170.00] killed him
[1170.00 → 1170.54] and all his
[1170.54 → 1171.10] followers and
[1171.10 → 1171.42] that was the
[1171.42 → 1171.88] end of that
[1171.88 → 1173.42] but there's a
[1173.42 → 1174.22] few others of
[1174.22 → 1175.06] these going on
[1175.06 → 1176.08] and one of the
[1176.08 → 1176.70] things they were
[1176.70 → 1178.16] expecting was
[1178.16 → 1178.96] that this prophet
[1178.96 → 1180.04] and this king
[1180.04 → 1180.74] would be able to
[1180.74 → 1181.68] feed them
[1181.68 → 1182.98] manna the way
[1182.98 → 1183.68] Moses did
[1183.68 → 1185.46] and so this is
[1185.46 → 1186.20] what's going on
[1186.20 → 1187.10] they see that
[1187.10 → 1188.78] Jesus can
[1188.78 → 1189.70] provide this
[1189.70 → 1190.54] food and this
[1190.54 → 1191.26] manna and they
[1191.26 → 1192.44] say here's the
[1192.44 → 1193.24] prophet here's the
[1193.24 → 1194.16] king here's the
[1194.16 → 1194.74] one that's going to
[1194.74 → 1196.16] liberate us and
[1196.16 → 1197.52] they're all waiting
[1197.52 → 1199.94] for this deliverance
[1199.94 → 1202.56] you see what john
[1202.56 → 1204.10] has done he's
[1204.10 → 1206.42] primed you as
[1206.42 → 1207.02] you've read this
[1207.02 → 1208.32] sign he's primed
[1208.32 → 1209.08] you to hear the
[1209.08 → 1209.86] answer of the
[1209.86 → 1210.36] meaning of the
[1210.36 → 1212.30] sign you're primed
[1212.30 → 1213.62] now to say is
[1213.62 → 1214.52] Jesus this new
[1214.52 → 1216.22] liberator is
[1216.22 → 1216.88] g is there going
[1216.88 → 1217.34] to be a new
[1217.34 → 1219.24] exodus is Jesus
[1219.24 → 1220.00] the new prophet
[1220.00 → 1221.10] is he the king
[1221.10 → 1223.02] and John's answer
[1223.02 → 1223.78] is going to be
[1223.78 → 1226.80] yes but not
[1226.80 → 1227.52] like you think
[1227.52 → 1229.84] not at all like
[1229.84 → 1230.34] you think
[1230.34 → 1232.16] Jesus doesn't want
[1232.16 → 1232.90] to be forced into
[1232.90 → 1233.80] his kingship so he
[1233.80 → 1234.68] crosses over the
[1234.68 → 1236.20] water and then
[1236.20 → 1237.12] the people find
[1237.12 → 1238.88] him and for
[1238.88 → 1241.24] verses 25 to
[1241.24 → 1242.42] the end of
[1242.42 → 1243.28] chapter 50
[1243.28 → 1244.88] end of verse 50
[1244.88 → 1245.88] he says
[1245.88 → 1247.42] there's a
[1247.42 → 1248.58] dialogue and
[1248.58 → 1249.52] this dialogue now
[1249.52 → 1251.18] explains what is
[1251.18 → 1252.36] going on with
[1252.36 → 1253.84] this sign and
[1253.84 → 1254.80] it's a complicated
[1254.80 → 1256.22] dialogue but
[1256.22 → 1256.64] what I'm going to
[1256.64 → 1257.16] do is I'm going to
[1257.16 → 1257.90] take you through it
[1257.90 → 1260.18] really simply and
[1260.18 → 1261.50] if we listen in on
[1261.50 → 1262.64] the discussion
[1262.64 → 1264.42] between Jesus and
[1264.42 → 1265.46] his disciples not
[1265.46 → 1266.46] just the 12 but a
[1266.46 → 1267.00] bigger group of
[1267.00 → 1267.70] disciples if we
[1267.70 → 1268.70] listen to the back
[1268.70 → 1269.88] and forth of this
[1269.88 → 1271.12] very complicated
[1271.12 → 1272.52] dialogue we're going
[1272.52 → 1273.18] to hear Jesus
[1273.18 → 1274.76] explain the meaning
[1274.76 → 1277.38] of this sign it
[1277.38 → 1278.58] starts with the
[1278.58 → 1279.38] people finding him
[1279.38 → 1280.66] and said look we
[1280.66 → 1281.20] want some more
[1281.20 → 1282.80] food Jesus says
[1282.80 → 1283.22] that's what i
[1283.22 → 1283.60] thought you
[1283.60 → 1284.34] misunderstood the
[1284.34 → 1285.34] sign what it was
[1285.34 → 1286.26] supposed to be
[1286.26 → 1287.50] teaching you is
[1287.50 → 1288.50] that I am the
[1288.50 → 1289.56] messiah that can
[1289.56 → 1290.18] give you eternal
[1290.18 → 1292.32] life and then
[1292.32 → 1293.00] what they say in
[1293.00 → 1294.30] verses 30 to 31
[1294.30 → 1296.86] is okay if you're
[1296.86 → 1298.82] that one give us a
[1298.82 → 1300.88] sign give us a
[1300.88 → 1302.50] sign here's what he's
[1302.50 → 1303.80] says in verses 30
[1303.80 → 1306.82] and 31 so they
[1306.82 → 1308.00] asked him what sign
[1308.00 → 1308.86] then will you give
[1308.86 → 1309.72] that we may see it
[1309.72 → 1310.56] and believe you
[1310.56 → 1312.14] what will you do
[1312.14 → 1314.10] let me suggest a
[1314.10 → 1315.78] sign he says our
[1315.78 → 1316.96] ancestors ate the
[1316.96 → 1317.80] manna in the
[1317.80 → 1319.46] wilderness as is
[1319.46 → 1321.04] written he gave
[1321.04 → 1321.78] them bread from
[1321.78 → 1322.64] heaven to eat
[1322.64 → 1324.14] now there's a
[1324.14 → 1325.00] rabbi at this time
[1325.00 → 1325.58] that wrote there
[1325.58 → 1326.14] was a first
[1326.14 → 1327.38] redeemer and he
[1327.38 → 1328.00] brought manna
[1328.00 → 1329.46] Moses and a
[1329.46 → 1330.30] second redeemer is
[1330.30 → 1330.98] coming, and he's
[1330.98 → 1331.34] going to bring
[1331.34 → 1331.94] manna, but he's
[1331.94 → 1332.30] going to bring
[1332.30 → 1333.12] the true life
[1333.12 → 1333.98] that manna gives
[1333.98 → 1335.80] that's what the
[1335.80 → 1336.64] rabbis were thinking
[1336.64 → 1337.44] that's the theology
[1337.44 → 1337.88] and so they're
[1337.88 → 1338.66] saying give us a
[1338.66 → 1340.50] sign give us this
[1340.50 → 1341.44] manna, and we'll
[1341.44 → 1342.04] know you're the
[1342.04 → 1342.86] one that is
[1342.86 → 1344.60] bringing life to
[1344.60 → 1345.90] us here's what the
[1345.90 → 1346.54] rabbi says the
[1346.54 → 1347.64] first redeemer brought
[1347.64 → 1349.06] down the manna so
[1349.06 → 1350.56] will the last
[1350.56 → 1353.72] redeemer manna life
[1353.72 → 1355.24] are you really the
[1355.24 → 1356.54] redeemer they're
[1356.54 → 1358.42] asking are you really
[1358.42 → 1358.88] the one that's
[1358.88 → 1359.32] going to give us
[1359.32 → 1361.52] life show us a
[1361.52 → 1363.14] sign by bringing
[1363.14 → 1364.62] more manna
[1364.62 → 1367.48] Jesus responds in
[1367.48 → 1368.52] verse 32 and
[1368.52 → 1370.54] 34 and he
[1370.54 → 1371.22] basically doesn't
[1371.22 → 1371.80] give him a sign
[1371.80 → 1372.80] he just says he
[1372.80 → 1373.96] just let's read it
[1373.96 → 1375.26] he says very
[1375.26 → 1376.28] truly I tell you
[1376.28 → 1377.40] it's not Moses who
[1377.40 → 1378.06] gave you the bread
[1378.06 → 1379.14] from heaven but it
[1379.14 → 1380.16] is my father who
[1380.16 → 1380.92] gives you the true
[1380.92 → 1381.74] bread from heaven
[1381.74 → 1383.08] for the bread of
[1383.08 → 1384.14] God is the bread
[1384.14 → 1385.00] that comes down
[1385.00 → 1385.76] from heaven and
[1385.76 → 1387.14] gives life to the
[1387.14 → 1389.78] world what is he
[1389.78 → 1391.44] saying he's saying
[1391.44 → 1393.28] God is now sending
[1393.28 → 1394.66] you that bread that
[1394.66 → 1395.24] you have been
[1395.24 → 1397.10] looking for he is
[1397.10 → 1397.98] sending you that
[1397.98 → 1398.68] bread you've been
[1398.68 → 1399.68] looking for that day
[1399.68 → 1402.02] has arrived the
[1402.02 → 1402.74] whole of your
[1402.74 → 1403.76] history has come to
[1403.76 → 1405.52] this day and God
[1405.52 → 1407.08] has given this bread
[1407.08 → 1408.48] he has given this
[1408.48 → 1410.14] new life that the
[1410.14 → 1411.86] manna represents
[1411.86 → 1414.04] and what is their
[1414.04 → 1415.04] response verse 34
[1415.04 → 1416.38] give us this bread
[1416.38 → 1418.16] give it to us we
[1418.16 → 1419.06] want it we want
[1419.06 → 1421.64] this life and then
[1421.64 → 1423.20] a long section
[1423.20 → 1424.20] Jesus says three
[1424.20 → 1426.62] things first
[1426.62 → 1429.82] I am the bread of
[1429.82 → 1431.94] life I am the one
[1431.94 → 1434.16] sent to heaven I am
[1434.16 → 1435.80] the manna that is
[1435.80 → 1437.02] given to you to eat
[1437.02 → 1439.84] verse 35 he says I
[1439.84 → 1440.78] am the bread of life
[1440.78 → 1442.02] whoever comes to me
[1442.02 → 1443.22] will never go hungry
[1443.22 → 1444.88] whoever believes in me
[1444.88 → 1446.48] will never be thirsty
[1446.48 → 1450.14] second he says you
[1450.14 → 1451.86] must believe and
[1451.86 → 1453.82] eat this bread
[1453.82 → 1455.10] listen to what he
[1455.10 → 1456.12] says I am the bread
[1456.12 → 1457.34] of life your
[1457.34 → 1458.74] ancestors ate manna
[1458.74 → 1459.74] in the wilderness yet
[1459.74 → 1461.58] they died but here
[1461.58 → 1462.38] is the bread that
[1462.38 → 1463.54] comes down from heaven
[1463.54 → 1464.90] which anyone may eat
[1464.90 → 1467.42] and not die I am the
[1467.42 → 1468.54] living bread that came
[1468.54 → 1469.38] down from heaven
[1469.38 → 1470.64] whoever eats this bread
[1470.64 → 1472.30] will live forever this
[1472.30 → 1474.14] bread is my flesh which
[1474.14 → 1475.94] I give for the life
[1475.94 → 1477.24] of the world you
[1477.24 → 1479.32] must eat this bread if
[1479.32 → 1480.46] you want this life you
[1480.46 → 1482.80] must believe but then
[1482.80 → 1484.12] thirdly he just makes
[1484.12 → 1486.22] it more complicated when
[1486.22 → 1487.08] he when they're
[1487.08 → 1489.36] questioning he is he
[1489.36 → 1491.04] doubles down he says
[1491.04 → 1493.32] very truly I tell you
[1493.32 → 1494.40] unless you eat the
[1494.40 → 1495.90] flesh of the son of man
[1495.90 → 1499.24] and drink his blood
[1499.24 → 1501.76] you'll have no life in
[1501.76 → 1502.00] you
[1502.00 → 1505.14] they are listening
[1505.14 → 1508.48] they don't have a clue
[1508.48 → 1509.68] what he's talking about
[1509.68 → 1511.60] they have no categories
[1511.60 → 1513.22] they have nothing and
[1513.22 → 1514.72] they cannot understand
[1514.72 → 1516.34] what he is talking about
[1516.34 → 1518.58] and so we receive the
[1518.58 → 1520.26] response that comes
[1520.26 → 1522.72] verse 52
[1522.72 → 1524.84] then the Jews began to
[1524.84 → 1525.82] argue among themselves
[1525.82 → 1528.14] how can this man give
[1528.14 → 1530.26] us his flesh to eat
[1530.26 → 1533.22] then we hear in verse 60
[1533.22 → 1534.44] on hearing this many of
[1534.44 → 1535.30] the disciples said
[1535.30 → 1537.48] this is a hard teaching
[1537.48 → 1538.88] to accept
[1538.88 → 1540.60] who can accept it
[1540.60 → 1542.96] then we hear in verse 66
[1542.96 → 1544.22] from that time on
[1544.22 → 1545.68] many of his disciples
[1545.68 → 1547.08] turned back and no longer
[1547.08 → 1547.80] followed him
[1547.80 → 1550.04] they don't know what he's
[1550.04 → 1550.64] talking about
[1550.64 → 1552.76] and sometimes we have
[1552.76 → 1553.60] misread this
[1553.60 → 1555.14] we've thought these poor
[1555.14 → 1557.00] stupid literalists
[1557.00 → 1558.54] don't they understand
[1558.54 → 1559.84] metaphor and figure of
[1559.84 → 1560.66] speech and how that
[1560.66 → 1561.08] works
[1561.08 → 1563.26] Jews are not stupid
[1563.26 → 1563.70] literalists
[1563.70 → 1564.76] they understood
[1564.76 → 1565.80] imagery
[1565.80 → 1567.06] very well
[1567.06 → 1568.58] they understood the
[1568.58 → 1569.74] notion of the bread of
[1569.74 → 1570.22] the Passover
[1570.22 → 1571.62] they understood very well
[1571.62 → 1572.44] the bread of man
[1572.44 → 1574.04] they understood all of
[1574.04 → 1575.44] that really
[1575.44 → 1576.08] well
[1576.08 → 1578.52] the problem for them
[1578.52 → 1579.22] was this
[1579.22 → 1582.06] how in the world
[1582.06 → 1583.46] can Jesus
[1583.46 → 1584.58] be the manna
[1584.58 → 1586.30] we know
[1586.30 → 1587.04] okay somebody could
[1587.04 → 1587.48] bring life
[1587.48 → 1587.94] but how can he
[1587.94 → 1589.02] be the manna
[1589.02 → 1590.44] how can his
[1590.44 → 1592.02] body be the
[1592.02 → 1592.58] Passover
[1592.58 → 1594.12] bread
[1594.12 → 1595.38] how can his
[1595.38 → 1596.50] blood be the
[1596.50 → 1597.52] Passover wine
[1597.52 → 1598.60] that makes
[1598.60 → 1599.60] no sense
[1599.60 → 1601.72] liberation
[1601.72 → 1603.04] is by revolution
[1603.04 → 1603.84] what does that
[1603.84 → 1604.56] mean
[1604.56 → 1605.58] that he gives us
[1605.58 → 1606.78] his body to eat
[1606.78 → 1607.38] and his blood
[1607.38 → 1608.02] to drink
[1608.02 → 1609.58] and so
[1609.58 → 1610.84] the first response
[1610.84 → 1611.86] is unbelief
[1611.86 → 1613.34] that makes no sense
[1613.34 → 1614.92] and they turn away
[1614.92 → 1617.36] the second response
[1617.36 → 1619.64] is that of faith
[1619.64 → 1621.80] Jesus says to them
[1621.80 → 1622.82] in verse 67
[1622.82 → 1624.50] he asks the 12
[1624.50 → 1625.76] do you want to leave
[1625.76 → 1626.06] too
[1626.06 → 1628.72] Peter always the one
[1628.72 → 1629.64] to answer on behalf
[1629.64 → 1630.44] of the 12 says
[1630.44 → 1632.36] Lord to whom shall we
[1632.36 → 1632.66] go
[1632.66 → 1633.94] you have words
[1633.94 → 1634.60] of life
[1634.60 → 1635.72] we have come to
[1635.72 → 1636.86] believe and to know
[1636.86 → 1637.64] that you are the
[1637.64 → 1638.36] holy one
[1638.36 → 1639.44] of God
[1639.44 → 1641.54] we know
[1641.54 → 1643.06] that you're the one
[1643.06 → 1643.90] that brings life
[1643.90 → 1645.08] and we believe
[1645.08 → 1647.04] but make no mistake
[1647.04 → 1649.16] what Jesus just said
[1649.16 → 1649.92] makes no sense
[1649.92 → 1650.52] to them either
[1650.52 → 1652.42] they don't know
[1652.42 → 1653.92] what he's talking
[1653.92 → 1654.22] about
[1654.22 → 1656.02] and through the book
[1656.02 → 1656.68] of John
[1656.68 → 1657.68] we're told this
[1657.68 → 1658.48] again and again
[1658.48 → 1660.14] that they
[1660.14 → 1661.86] do not understand
[1661.86 → 1662.42] what Jesus
[1662.42 → 1663.32] is talking about
[1663.32 → 1664.82] listen to what
[1664.82 → 1665.84] is said
[1665.84 → 1666.66] in chapter 2
[1666.66 → 1668.46] after he was
[1668.46 → 1669.58] raised from the dead
[1669.58 → 1670.84] his disciples
[1670.84 → 1672.24] recalled what he
[1672.24 → 1672.78] said
[1672.78 → 1674.20] and then they
[1674.20 → 1674.94] believed
[1674.94 → 1675.94] the scripture
[1675.94 → 1677.04] and the words
[1677.04 → 1677.94] that God had spoken
[1677.94 → 1679.50] and at the end
[1679.50 → 1680.24] of this section
[1680.24 → 1681.22] it says at first
[1681.22 → 1681.94] his disciples
[1681.94 → 1682.94] did not understand
[1682.94 → 1683.48] this
[1683.48 → 1685.08] only after Jesus
[1685.08 → 1686.36] was glorified
[1686.36 → 1687.16] did they realize
[1687.16 → 1687.80] that these things
[1687.80 → 1688.22] had been written
[1688.22 → 1688.82] about him
[1688.82 → 1689.74] and that these things
[1689.74 → 1690.26] had been done
[1690.26 → 1690.74] to him
[1690.74 → 1692.46] they couldn't
[1692.46 → 1693.42] understand what
[1693.42 → 1694.14] he was talking
[1694.14 → 1694.54] about
[1694.54 → 1695.64] but they knew
[1695.64 → 1696.56] a time was coming
[1696.56 → 1697.40] when they would
[1697.40 → 1697.96] and they said
[1697.96 → 1699.58] okay we believe
[1699.58 → 1700.92] life comes from you
[1700.92 → 1701.62] and we're willing
[1701.62 → 1702.72] to wait to figure
[1702.72 → 1704.50] out how this works
[1704.50 → 1707.76] now if you're
[1707.76 → 1708.82] reading a Jew
[1708.82 → 1709.72] reading John
[1709.72 → 1711.64] here's how it goes
[1711.64 → 1712.78] you know it's
[1712.78 → 1713.68] the book of signs
[1713.68 → 1715.46] and you go
[1715.46 → 1716.40] wine
[1716.40 → 1717.22] water turned
[1717.22 → 1717.82] into wine
[1717.82 → 1718.82] there's the first
[1718.82 → 1719.80] sign John says
[1719.80 → 1721.74] the official's son
[1721.74 → 1722.24] is healed
[1722.24 → 1723.20] there's the second
[1723.20 → 1724.30] sign John says
[1724.30 → 1725.04] and he says
[1725.04 → 1725.66] now you're on your
[1725.66 → 1725.86] own
[1725.86 → 1726.68] you keep counting
[1726.68 → 1728.46] the third sign
[1728.46 → 1729.40] the crippled man
[1729.40 → 1730.34] is healed
[1730.34 → 1731.68] the fourth sign
[1731.68 → 1732.52] the five thousand
[1732.52 → 1733.56] are fed
[1733.56 → 1735.20] the fifth sign
[1735.20 → 1735.92] the blind man
[1735.92 → 1736.46] is healed
[1736.46 → 1737.84] the sixth sign
[1737.84 → 1738.48] Lazarus
[1738.48 → 1739.08] is raised from
[1739.08 → 1739.60] the dead
[1739.60 → 1742.04] and then it ends
[1742.04 → 1744.16] Jews
[1744.16 → 1745.60] for whom numbers
[1745.60 → 1746.54] are really important
[1746.54 → 1747.08] just go
[1747.08 → 1747.90] you can't
[1747.90 → 1748.84] end at six
[1748.84 → 1750.20] that's an imperfect
[1750.20 → 1750.68] number
[1750.68 → 1751.42] and they go back
[1751.42 → 1751.70] and they say
[1751.70 → 1752.44] let's read it again
[1752.44 → 1753.44] go through this
[1753.44 → 1754.34] shoot
[1754.34 → 1755.06] there's six
[1755.06 → 1756.12] go back
[1756.12 → 1756.70] and they read it
[1756.70 → 1756.98] again
[1756.98 → 1757.76] there's six
[1757.76 → 1759.44] what's going on
[1759.44 → 1759.78] here
[1759.78 → 1760.54] and it's like
[1760.54 → 1761.62] John winks at them
[1761.62 → 1761.98] and says
[1761.98 → 1763.04] keep reading
[1763.04 → 1764.84] the seventh sign
[1764.84 → 1766.28] is coming
[1766.28 → 1769.04] and what is that sign
[1769.04 → 1771.08] my two favourite
[1771.08 → 1772.18] New Testament scholars
[1772.18 → 1773.02] are Tom Wright
[1773.02 → 1774.58] and Richard Beckham
[1774.58 → 1776.28] Tom Wright says
[1776.28 → 1777.36] the seventh sign
[1777.36 → 1778.84] is the crucifixion
[1778.84 → 1780.38] Richard Beckham
[1780.38 → 1781.56] says the seventh sign
[1781.56 → 1782.54] is the resurrection
[1782.54 → 1784.30] those two guys
[1784.30 → 1785.18] are way smarter
[1785.18 → 1786.06] than I'll ever be
[1786.06 → 1787.62] I have no idea
[1787.62 → 1788.42] how to decide
[1788.42 → 1788.96] between us
[1788.96 → 1789.38] I'll say
[1789.38 → 1789.96] it's got to be
[1789.96 → 1790.56] both of them
[1790.56 → 1792.26] that sign
[1792.26 → 1793.36] is that complex
[1793.36 → 1793.92] of events
[1793.92 → 1794.48] that comes
[1794.48 → 1795.14] in the cross
[1795.14 → 1795.88] and the resurrection
[1795.88 → 1797.40] where Jesus
[1797.40 → 1798.16] at the time
[1798.16 → 1798.90] of Passover
[1798.90 → 1799.86] says
[1799.86 → 1801.40] this is my body
[1801.40 → 1802.66] given for you
[1802.66 → 1804.08] this is my blood
[1804.08 → 1805.02] poured out for you
[1805.02 → 1806.14] at the blood of the Passover
[1806.14 → 1807.46] in this
[1807.46 → 1809.10] you are being liberated
[1809.10 → 1810.06] from idolatry
[1810.06 → 1811.38] not an act of violence
[1811.38 → 1812.56] but my death
[1812.56 → 1813.62] taking violence
[1813.62 → 1814.44] on myself
[1814.44 → 1816.50] and then in the resurrection
[1816.50 → 1818.36] I rise to new life
[1818.36 → 1819.94] and then by the spirit
[1819.94 → 1821.90] I give you that new life
[1821.90 → 1823.36] that's how you can
[1823.36 → 1824.58] feed on me
[1824.58 → 1826.38] and have my life
[1826.38 → 1828.64] now they're able
[1828.64 → 1829.30] to understand
[1829.30 → 1829.98] with the spirit
[1829.98 → 1830.78] that Jesus
[1830.78 → 1831.92] is offering
[1831.92 → 1834.04] his very life
[1834.04 → 1834.88] to them
[1834.88 → 1835.88] and to us
[1835.88 → 1837.04] by taking
[1837.04 → 1838.42] our curse
[1838.42 → 1838.94] and sin
[1838.94 → 1839.72] and idolatry
[1839.72 → 1840.42] on himself
[1840.42 → 1841.92] by rising
[1841.92 → 1842.58] from the dead
[1842.58 → 1843.34] into new life
[1843.34 → 1844.24] and by the spirit
[1844.24 → 1845.66] giving us that life
[1845.66 → 1847.74] come feed on me
[1847.74 → 1849.24] and my
[1849.24 → 1849.98] very
[1849.98 → 1851.06] life
[1851.06 → 1851.70] will
[1851.70 → 1852.50] become
[1852.50 → 1853.64] yours
[1853.64 → 1855.54] and it's only
[1855.54 → 1856.38] in light of this
[1856.38 → 1857.14] that the bread
[1857.14 → 1857.72] imagery
[1857.72 → 1859.64] begins to become
[1859.64 → 1860.18] clear
[1860.18 → 1861.60] the bread
[1861.60 → 1862.44] of the Passover
[1862.44 → 1863.44] that signified
[1863.44 → 1864.18] liberation
[1864.18 → 1865.46] that's going to
[1865.46 → 1866.32] come in his death
[1866.32 → 1867.64] the manna
[1867.64 → 1868.54] that signified
[1868.54 → 1869.66] true life
[1869.66 → 1870.74] that's going to
[1870.74 → 1872.04] come in his death
[1872.04 → 1874.68] and so
[1874.68 → 1875.52] as we come
[1875.52 → 1875.98] to the end
[1875.98 → 1876.46] of this
[1876.46 → 1877.38] we say
[1877.38 → 1877.86] what is
[1877.86 → 1878.92] in the world
[1878.92 → 1879.72] is John
[1879.72 → 1880.28] saying
[1880.28 → 1882.48] he's saying
[1882.48 → 1883.76] three things
[1883.76 → 1884.38] saying
[1884.38 → 1885.00] about
[1885.00 → 1886.28] 103 things
[1886.28 → 1887.00] but here are
[1887.00 → 1887.92] three of the things
[1887.92 → 1888.52] he is saying
[1888.52 → 1889.36] first
[1889.36 → 1891.24] I am the better
[1891.24 → 1891.78] Moses
[1891.78 → 1893.84] Moses came
[1893.84 → 1894.60] to liberate you
[1894.60 → 1895.52] from idolatry
[1895.52 → 1896.46] and it didn't work
[1896.46 → 1897.88] that first exodus
[1897.88 → 1898.48] didn't work
[1898.48 → 1900.42] Jesus is a better
[1900.42 → 1900.82] Moses
[1900.82 → 1902.18] and he can
[1902.18 → 1902.84] liberate you
[1902.84 → 1904.20] and so
[1904.20 → 1904.78] he comes
[1904.78 → 1905.56] John comes to
[1905.56 → 1905.88] up and says
[1905.88 → 1906.26] you want to be
[1906.26 → 1906.78] liberated
[1906.78 → 1908.40] that culture
[1908.40 → 1908.96] of consumer
[1908.96 → 1909.86] idolatry
[1909.86 → 1910.54] that's offering
[1910.54 → 1911.10] you life
[1911.10 → 1911.72] and you want
[1911.72 → 1912.02] to find
[1912.02 → 1912.84] true life
[1912.84 → 1914.20] Jesus is
[1914.20 → 1914.70] that better
[1914.70 → 1915.12] Moses
[1915.12 → 1916.22] that can
[1916.22 → 1916.74] liberate
[1916.74 → 1917.32] you
[1917.32 → 1918.34] so you
[1918.34 → 1918.64] can have
[1918.64 → 1919.04] life
[1919.04 → 1921.00] secondly
[1921.00 → 1921.66] he says
[1921.66 → 1923.32] I am a
[1923.32 → 1923.50] better
[1923.50 → 1924.12] Passover
[1924.12 → 1925.94] that second
[1925.94 → 1926.40] exodus
[1926.40 → 1926.94] has come
[1926.94 → 1927.40] in me
[1927.40 → 1928.56] that bread
[1928.56 → 1929.42] that wine
[1929.42 → 1930.60] that lamb
[1930.60 → 1931.62] all of that
[1931.62 → 1932.28] is fulfilled
[1932.28 → 1932.88] in me
[1932.88 → 1934.28] and now
[1934.28 → 1935.04] through
[1935.04 → 1936.24] my death
[1936.24 → 1937.90] I am going
[1937.90 → 1938.46] to give you
[1938.46 → 1939.18] life
[1939.18 → 1941.46] and finally
[1941.46 → 1941.94] he says
[1941.94 → 1943.08] I am the
[1943.08 → 1943.44] better
[1943.44 → 1944.28] manna
[1944.28 → 1945.50] that manna
[1945.50 → 1946.00] that could only
[1946.00 → 1946.54] feed you
[1946.54 → 1946.96] for a little
[1946.96 → 1947.44] while
[1947.44 → 1948.74] I am going
[1948.74 → 1949.44] to give you
[1949.44 → 1950.36] that life
[1950.36 → 1951.50] that true
[1951.50 → 1952.00] life
[1952.00 → 1952.96] that full
[1952.96 → 1953.44] life
[1953.44 → 1954.76] for you
[1954.76 → 1955.58] to one day
[1955.58 → 1956.10] enjoy
[1956.10 → 1957.40] and we hear
[1957.40 → 1957.76] in verses
[1957.76 → 1958.70] 40 to 54
[1958.70 → 1959.18] I am going
[1959.18 → 1959.92] to raise
[1959.92 → 1960.62] them up
[1960.62 → 1961.42] on that
[1961.42 → 1962.24] last day
[1962.24 → 1962.92] you will
[1962.92 → 1963.48] experience
[1963.48 → 1964.34] that life
[1964.34 → 1965.48] but until
[1965.48 → 1965.94] then it is
[1965.94 → 1966.28] like the
[1966.28 → 1966.64] manna
[1966.64 → 1967.70] you go out
[1967.70 → 1967.90] to get
[1967.90 → 1968.42] the manna
[1968.42 → 1969.04] you feed
[1969.04 → 1969.44] yourself
[1969.44 → 1970.18] every day
[1970.18 → 1971.16] you feed
[1971.16 → 1971.58] yourself
[1971.58 → 1972.52] and every
[1972.52 → 1972.86] day
[1972.86 → 1973.76] through prayer
[1973.76 → 1974.18] through the
[1974.18 → 1974.46] word
[1974.46 → 1974.96] we feed
[1974.96 → 1975.52] ourselves
[1975.52 → 1976.06] and that
[1976.06 → 1976.60] new life
[1976.60 → 1977.46] becomes more
[1977.46 → 1978.14] and more
[1978.14 → 1978.58] ours
[1978.58 → 1980.98] John
[1980.98 → 1981.68] it says
[1981.68 → 1982.90] the living
[1982.90 → 1983.50] Christ
[1983.50 → 1984.90] has come
[1984.90 → 1985.78] and continues
[1985.78 → 1986.46] to come
[1986.46 → 1986.92] to us
[1986.92 → 1987.74] to offer
[1987.74 → 1988.94] life in
[1988.94 → 1989.56] abundance
[1989.56 → 1990.74] life
[1990.74 → 1991.94] in full
[1991.94 → 1993.42] we're told
[1993.42 → 1993.92] he comes
[1993.92 → 1994.38] to us
[1994.38 → 1995.46] clothed
[1995.46 → 1995.88] in the word
[1995.88 → 1996.34] of God
[1996.34 → 1997.18] listen to this
[1997.18 → 1998.40] the spirit
[1998.40 → 1999.34] gives life
[1999.34 → 2000.32] the flesh
[2000.32 → 2000.88] counts for
[2000.88 → 2001.20] nothing
[2001.20 → 2002.46] the words
[2002.46 → 2002.76] I have
[2002.76 → 2003.56] spoken to
[2003.56 → 2003.84] you
[2003.84 → 2004.20] they are
[2004.20 → 2004.70] full of
[2004.70 → 2005.28] spirit
[2005.28 → 2005.94] and life
[2005.94 → 2007.44] if we
[2007.44 → 2008.64] are sitting
[2008.64 → 2009.00] here
[2009.00 → 2009.42] saying
[2009.42 → 2009.88] give us
[2009.88 → 2010.50] this life
[2010.50 → 2011.44] and reaching
[2011.44 → 2011.86] out in
[2011.86 → 2012.26] faith
[2012.26 → 2013.58] Jesus is
[2013.58 → 2014.16] coming in
[2014.16 → 2014.92] those words
[2014.92 → 2016.02] and giving
[2016.02 → 2016.64] his own
[2016.64 → 2017.06] life
[2017.06 → 2017.68] by the
[2017.68 → 2018.04] spirit
[2018.04 → 2019.58] but it's
[2019.58 → 2019.96] also
[2019.96 → 2020.88] he comes
[2020.88 → 2021.48] and if we
[2021.48 → 2021.86] eat
[2021.86 → 2022.56] and to eat
[2022.56 → 2023.46] is to hear
[2023.46 → 2025.04] and to receive
[2025.04 → 2026.78] and to believe
[2026.78 → 2028.62] but he also
[2028.62 → 2029.28] comes to us
[2029.28 → 2029.98] clothed in
[2029.98 → 2030.30] the bread
[2030.30 → 2030.88] and wine
[2030.88 → 2032.26] very truly
[2032.26 → 2032.80] I tell you
[2032.80 → 2033.16] unless you
[2033.16 → 2033.88] eat the flesh
[2033.88 → 2034.36] of the son
[2034.36 → 2034.66] of man
[2034.66 → 2035.02] and drink
[2035.02 → 2035.50] his blood
[2035.50 → 2035.80] you have
[2035.80 → 2036.34] no life
[2036.34 → 2036.80] in you
[2036.80 → 2038.14] and as he
[2038.14 → 2038.80] comes
[2038.80 → 2039.52] and shortly
[2039.52 → 2040.72] in the bread
[2040.72 → 2041.38] and the wine
[2041.38 → 2042.44] if we reach
[2042.44 → 2043.00] out and take
[2043.00 → 2043.66] that life
[2043.66 → 2044.24] as he comes
[2044.24 → 2044.56] to us
[2044.56 → 2044.86] in those
[2044.86 → 2045.28] elements
[2045.28 → 2046.50] he gives
[2046.50 → 2046.90] us
[2046.90 → 2048.18] that new
[2048.18 → 2048.62] life
[2048.62 → 2049.82] and to eat
[2049.82 → 2050.74] of his flesh
[2050.74 → 2051.22] and to drink
[2051.22 → 2051.82] of his blood
[2051.82 → 2052.34] is to take
[2052.34 → 2052.90] those elements
[2052.90 → 2053.76] and to receive
[2053.76 → 2054.60] his life
[2054.60 → 2055.12] as he gives
[2055.12 → 2056.40] it to us
[2056.40 → 2059.90] we can say
[2059.90 → 2061.18] to the daggers
[2061.18 → 2062.42] around our world
[2062.42 → 2064.26] that are looking
[2064.26 → 2064.90] for life
[2064.90 → 2066.04] and are dissatisfied
[2066.04 → 2067.40] that life
[2067.40 → 2067.88] is found
[2067.88 → 2068.44] in Jesus
[2068.44 → 2070.66] and in verse 51
[2070.66 → 2071.58] we're told
[2071.58 → 2072.26] that Jesus
[2072.26 → 2073.26] gives himself
[2073.26 → 2074.18] for the life
[2074.18 → 2075.70] of the world
[2075.70 → 2077.00] that bread
[2077.00 → 2077.70] is not just
[2077.70 → 2078.16] for us
[2078.16 → 2078.82] to enjoy
[2078.82 → 2079.52] that life
[2079.52 → 2080.02] today
[2080.02 → 2081.44] but we're
[2081.44 → 2082.22] given that bread
[2082.22 → 2082.70] we're given
[2082.70 → 2083.42] that life
[2083.42 → 2084.42] to make
[2084.42 → 2085.02] it has known
[2085.02 → 2086.54] in our lives
[2086.54 → 2087.76] our words
[2087.76 → 2089.96] and our deeds
[2089.96 → 2091.92] there are many
[2091.92 → 2093.16] Mick Jagger
[2093.16 → 2093.70] out there
[2093.70 → 2095.66] and you and I
[2095.66 → 2096.48] even experience
[2096.48 → 2097.20] some of that
[2097.20 → 2098.16] living in our world
[2098.16 → 2100.64] but Jesus is saying
[2100.64 → 2102.24] I have something
[2102.24 → 2103.10] that does give
[2103.10 → 2103.96] satisfaction
[2103.96 → 2105.20] satisfaction
[2105.20 → 2106.28] that even
[2106.28 → 2107.32] lasts
[2107.32 → 2108.32] through death
[2108.32 → 2110.02] pain
[2110.02 → 2111.52] and suffering
[2111.52 → 2112.88] and the misery
[2112.88 → 2113.96] of a broken world
[2113.96 → 2115.70] but one day
[2115.70 → 2117.18] you'll be raised up
[2117.18 → 2118.32] on that last day
[2118.32 → 2119.62] if you
[2119.62 → 2121.02] but believe
[2121.02 → 2121.86] and take hold
[2121.86 → 2122.88] of me
[2122.88 → 2124.92] let's pray
[2124.92 → 2125.54] together
[2125.54 → 2129.26] Lord
[2129.26 → 2129.74] thank you
[2129.74 → 2130.54] for this life
[2130.54 → 2130.98] that you have
[2130.98 → 2131.34] brought
[2131.34 → 2132.82] thank you
[2132.82 → 2133.22] for not
[2133.22 → 2134.42] abandoning us
[2134.42 → 2135.18] when we turn
[2135.18 → 2136.02] from you
[2136.02 → 2137.64] to dusty
[2137.64 → 2138.42] cisterns
[2138.42 → 2139.28] to find life
[2139.28 → 2141.24] thank you
[2141.24 → 2141.90] for giving us
[2141.90 → 2142.28] life

[2143.42 → 2144.20] for your work
[2144.20 → 2144.80] your death
[2144.80 → 2145.56] your resurrection
[2145.56 → 2147.28] help us
[2147.28 → 2147.62] Lord
[2147.62 → 2149.52] we believe
[2149.52 → 2150.24] but help us
[2150.24 → 2151.14] in our unbelief
[2151.14 → 2152.70] help us
[2152.70 → 2153.22] to flee
[2153.22 → 2153.78] to you
[2153.78 → 2155.86] to find that life
[2155.86 → 2156.70] again and again
[2156.70 → 2157.92] and that manna
[2157.92 → 2159.28] that brings life

[2161.20 → 2162.92] nourish us
[2162.92 → 2163.54] this morning
[2163.54 → 2165.22] not only
[2165.22 → 2166.04] for our own sake
[2166.04 → 2167.90] but for the sake
[2167.90 → 2168.66] of the world
[2168.66 → 2169.90] in Christ's name
[2169.90 → 2170.94] Amen
