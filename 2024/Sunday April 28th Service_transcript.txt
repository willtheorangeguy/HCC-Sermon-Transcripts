[0.00 --> 12.42]  I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like Pastor Jonathan is trying to sneak a new musician into his worship team every time he leads.
[13.48 --> 16.84]  I had a couple people in the 9 a.m. say, is that a new floatist that we have?
[16.90 --> 19.12]  I'm like, yes, he just keeps sneaking in new musicians.
[20.24 --> 21.44]  Thank you for leading us.
[23.10 --> 26.50]  As Brad mentioned, we are in the middle of a sermon series on forgiveness.
[26.50 --> 33.50]  And I thought it might be helpful just to summarize briefly where we have traveled so far, and then we're going to read our passage.
[34.52 --> 41.34]  Pastor Sid began this series by looking at Matthew chapter 6, where we are told to forgive as we have been forgiven.
[41.60 --> 48.56]  That the ability to extend grace is deeply rooted to our ability to receive the extravagant grace of Jesus.
[48.56 --> 56.64]  Then we looked at Matthew 18, where we realized the invitation is not just a generic forgiveness, but a forgiveness from the heart.
[57.46 --> 60.02]  And that's a command, not an invitation.
[60.56 --> 62.62]  A serious command with serious consequences.
[63.68 --> 68.26]  That's also when we looked at the definition of forgiveness from Tim Keller, and I think it's helpful to repeat.
[69.00 --> 73.68]  Where forgiveness is renouncing revenge and being open to reconciliation.
[73.68 --> 82.42]  And last week, Pastor Jonathan was opening up the teaching, both in Matthew 18 and Galatians 6, that we are invited to confront sin.
[82.64 --> 84.14]  Very challenging thing to do.
[84.80 --> 91.32]  We are invited to do so with gentleness, with love, with tenderness, so that there can be reconciliation.
[92.46 --> 98.68]  And then Jonathan kindly said that, I'm going to come up and teach on all the hard things about forgiveness that no one wants to talk about.
[99.22 --> 100.20]  And he wasn't wrong.
[100.20 --> 110.00]  I want to say at the outset that this is a bit of a unique sermon, because I've tried to incorporate, as much as I could, some of the feedback we've been getting over the course of the last three weeks.
[110.90 --> 116.30]  There's no question that when you talk about forgiveness, life stories come up, challenging circumstances are shared.
[116.72 --> 123.16]  And I want to honor some of the things that have been shared with me, because I appreciate some of the struggles that people in our church are going through.
[123.66 --> 127.48]  And the stuff forgiveness brings up in their life, so you're going to hear some of that this morning.
[127.48 --> 133.18]  If you have your Bible, digital or physical, turn with me to Romans chapter 12.
[133.80 --> 137.98]  We're going to read 9 to 21, but I'm going to focus on verse 17 to 19.
[139.02 --> 141.70]  So Romans 12, starting at verse 9.
[141.70 --> 147.56]  Love must be sincere.
[147.56 --> 150.46]  Hate what is evil.
[150.84 --> 152.20]  Cling to what is good.
[153.06 --> 155.42]  Be devoted to another in love.
[156.40 --> 158.54]  Honor one another above yourselves.
[159.52 --> 163.80]  Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor serving the Lord.
[164.80 --> 166.12]  Be joyful in hope.
[167.08 --> 168.30]  Patient in affliction.
[169.50 --> 170.58]  Faithful in prayer.
[170.58 --> 174.40]  Share with the Lord's people who are in need.
[174.84 --> 176.22]  Practice hospitality.
[177.40 --> 178.90]  Bless those who persecute you.
[179.16 --> 181.18]  Bless and do not curse.
[182.14 --> 183.78]  Rejoice with those who rejoice.
[184.16 --> 185.64]  Mourn with those who mourn.
[186.38 --> 188.24]  Live in harmony with one another.
[189.32 --> 193.76]  Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position.
[194.44 --> 196.94]  Do not think you are superior.
[196.94 --> 200.56]  Do not repay anyone evil for evil.
[200.72 --> 203.92]  Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.
[204.76 --> 210.56]  If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
[210.56 --> 214.58]  Do not take revenge, my dear friends.
[215.00 --> 217.04]  But leave room for God's wrath.
[217.52 --> 220.08]  For it is written, it is mine to avenge.
[220.30 --> 222.36]  I will repay, says the Lord.
[222.36 --> 226.54]  On the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[227.02 --> 229.16]  If he is thirsty, give him something to drink.
[229.58 --> 232.48]  In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.
[233.58 --> 238.46]  Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
[238.46 --> 248.50]  Now I want to begin by sharing two scenarios that help us get into this conversation a little bit.
[248.90 --> 252.36]  The first scenario is of a pastor of a mid-sized church,
[252.36 --> 256.78]  and it came to light that this pastor had an affair with a member of his church,
[257.38 --> 258.96]  and at first he denied it,
[259.12 --> 261.30]  and then when the evidence and the testimony was overwhelming,
[261.48 --> 263.72]  he acknowledged it but downplayed his role in it
[263.72 --> 266.20]  and shifted the blame towards the other party in the affair.
[266.20 --> 269.60]  The leaders of the church had this very challenging task
[269.60 --> 272.66]  of establishing a healing and restoration process,
[273.12 --> 275.24]  which this pastor tried to short-circuit
[275.24 --> 278.10]  so that he could get back to his position as soon as possible.
[278.90 --> 281.90]  And along the way, he kept reminding his own congregation
[281.90 --> 284.22]  of their command to forgive him.
[286.52 --> 289.80]  Second scenario, a mother and a daughter.
[290.76 --> 293.80]  The daughter learned at a young age that you do not cross her mother.
[294.40 --> 295.36]  There are consequences.
[296.20 --> 298.62]  For denying or saying no to your mother.
[299.16 --> 303.96]  And it just so happened that this daughter met and then married a young man
[303.96 --> 305.82]  that this mother very much did not like,
[305.94 --> 307.86]  for reasons the daughter could never even understand.
[308.74 --> 310.98]  The mother would criticize this man,
[311.40 --> 315.08]  and she would often speak very disparagingly of this man to her daughter
[315.08 --> 317.20]  and to family members and friends in her church.
[317.60 --> 320.88]  And every now and then, she would sort of overflow with her anger,
[320.88 --> 324.46]  and she would say very hurtful things about the decisions her daughter has made,
[324.56 --> 325.52]  the nature of their marriage,
[325.68 --> 328.58]  and sort of explode some of her unfair emotions.
[329.38 --> 332.46]  Only to then pick up the phone the day after she would explode
[332.46 --> 333.18]  and say to her daughter,
[333.26 --> 334.42]  I'm so sorry, I didn't mean it.
[334.46 --> 335.12]  Will you forgive me?
[335.12 --> 339.10]  And the daughter, of course, with deep hurt, would do so.
[339.88 --> 343.60]  But the hurt knowing that her mother would do this again and again and again
[343.60 --> 345.10]  several times each year.
[347.22 --> 349.24]  These are just two stories
[349.24 --> 352.76]  that open up the difficulty of forgiveness and reconciliation.
[352.76 --> 354.70]  You could tell many more, I'm sure.
[355.82 --> 359.58]  Stories of loved ones, spouses, friends, coworkers,
[360.52 --> 363.38]  who have a very creative way of downplaying sin,
[363.78 --> 367.26]  denying sin, creatively avoiding even talking about it.
[367.98 --> 369.72]  They are sorry they got caught,
[369.80 --> 372.74]  but show no real repentance for the damage that has been done.
[373.06 --> 375.48]  And along the way, they can even weaponize
[375.48 --> 377.74]  the Christian command for forgiveness
[377.74 --> 381.60]  as a way of saving face and avoiding getting caught.
[382.76 --> 386.32]  And some of us know exactly what I'm talking about
[386.32 --> 388.04]  in your experience.
[389.22 --> 391.02]  And it's very difficult sometimes
[391.02 --> 392.98]  to even sit under this teaching
[392.98 --> 394.46]  and this sermon series on forgiveness
[394.46 --> 396.06]  when you're thinking to yourself,
[396.20 --> 398.80]  okay, I do forgive, and I will forgive,
[398.94 --> 400.30]  and I desire to forgive,
[400.62 --> 402.74]  but I keep getting hurt.
[403.52 --> 405.10]  And what do I do then?
[405.18 --> 407.34]  And how do I deal with the anger I have
[407.34 --> 409.16]  towards the hurt that this person
[409.16 --> 411.68]  continues to do towards me?
[412.76 --> 414.34]  It's an important question,
[414.42 --> 416.18]  a question people have been asking us
[416.18 --> 417.30]  throughout this series.
[417.44 --> 418.92]  And so this morning, we're going to look at
[418.92 --> 421.34]  what Romans 12 has to say.
[422.30 --> 424.60]  Now, Romans 12, in my opinion,
[424.76 --> 426.54]  is rapid-fire wisdom.
[426.80 --> 428.50]  Like, one writer describes this
[428.50 --> 431.20]  as Paul's rule for life and community.
[431.80 --> 433.96]  And I might suggest that a good way of reading it
[433.96 --> 435.00]  is actually like a list.
[435.42 --> 436.94]  Like, it reads in paragraphs in our Bible,
[436.94 --> 439.02]  but really, Paul's just giving lots
[439.02 --> 441.08]  of very important wisdom
[441.08 --> 443.94]  and virtues of how to live
[443.94 --> 444.96]  in a broken community.
[445.08 --> 446.94]  And it's important to underscore, by the way,
[447.10 --> 448.56]  that Paul would not have written
[448.56 --> 449.68]  this portion of the letter
[449.68 --> 452.02]  if everything was going splendidly
[452.02 --> 453.04]  in the church in Rome.
[453.68 --> 455.08]  But we know that there is conflict,
[455.22 --> 456.24]  we know that there is division,
[456.36 --> 457.32]  we know that there is anger,
[457.44 --> 460.02]  and so Paul gives a lot of this instruction
[460.02 --> 461.54]  about conflict,
[462.36 --> 462.94]  about revenge,
[462.94 --> 466.44]  about how to bless those who persecute you
[466.44 --> 468.12]  and not curse them.
[468.46 --> 468.76]  Why?
[469.04 --> 470.80]  Because that's what was happening
[470.80 --> 471.76]  in the church.
[472.72 --> 475.00]  So let's take a look at this passage.
[476.98 --> 478.98]  First thing we see Paul doing
[478.98 --> 481.20]  is starting with love.
[481.26 --> 483.70]  He says, love must be sincere.
[484.26 --> 485.74]  And look what he says right afterwards.
[486.72 --> 488.16]  Hate what is evil,
[489.04 --> 491.16]  cling to what is good.
[491.16 --> 493.16]  It's not unintentional.
[494.14 --> 495.86]  And it's important to connect this love
[495.86 --> 497.14]  to the hate of evil.
[497.96 --> 498.98]  Parents understand this.
[499.08 --> 500.72]  It is a loving parent
[500.72 --> 502.50]  will not let their older sibling,
[502.80 --> 503.48]  older child,
[503.68 --> 505.22]  pulverize a younger child.
[505.56 --> 505.70]  Right?
[506.20 --> 506.98]  They will intervene.
[507.74 --> 509.82]  A loving spouse will not just let it go
[509.82 --> 511.46]  if there's adultery in their marriage.
[511.74 --> 513.02]  These things must be addressed.
[513.14 --> 513.86]  They must be named.
[513.96 --> 515.46]  They must be stood against.
[515.80 --> 517.56]  And it is because we love
[517.56 --> 518.64]  that we do that.
[518.64 --> 521.02]  It is out of love
[521.02 --> 522.62]  that we hate what is evil.
[523.30 --> 524.80]  We hate the things that God hates,
[524.90 --> 525.54]  you might say.
[526.00 --> 527.54]  And this is where I want to name something
[527.54 --> 529.10]  that we should have said earlier
[529.10 --> 529.74]  in the series.
[530.32 --> 531.94]  That is the role of anger.
[533.60 --> 535.60]  Forgiveness is deeply attached
[535.60 --> 538.16]  to this emotion of anger.
[538.50 --> 539.64]  And I want to name, first of all,
[539.70 --> 541.92]  that anger is not an inherently evil emotion.
[542.04 --> 543.44]  It's something we're given in many ways
[543.44 --> 544.70]  out of self-protection.
[544.70 --> 547.08]  It's something that arises in us unexpectedly
[547.08 --> 548.34]  when evil is done.
[548.96 --> 551.28]  And it's often because you love someone
[551.28 --> 553.22]  or you love a family member
[553.22 --> 554.52]  or a friend or a co-worker
[554.52 --> 556.42]  that you are so angry
[556.42 --> 558.08]  when evil and misconduct
[558.66 --> 560.66]  and damage is done in relationship.
[562.40 --> 563.86]  Now, it's important to name
[563.86 --> 566.28]  that in some senses,
[566.94 --> 570.32]  it would be strange not to get angry
[570.32 --> 572.80]  when you're manipulated by your mother
[572.80 --> 574.44]  or lied to by your pastor
[574.44 --> 576.24]  or abused by a family member.
[576.32 --> 576.92]  These things,
[577.32 --> 579.46]  we have this visceral, angry response
[579.46 --> 581.76]  that mirrors Jesus' own anger.
[582.20 --> 582.36]  Right?
[582.82 --> 583.52]  In the Old Testament,
[583.66 --> 584.68]  God gets angry at sin.
[584.76 --> 585.32]  In the New Testament,
[585.46 --> 586.24]  Jesus gets angry,
[586.42 --> 588.98]  especially when a place of worship
[588.98 --> 590.66]  exploits the poor.
[591.32 --> 592.72]  And Jesus doesn't just stand by idly.
[592.80 --> 594.26]  He gets angry and he acts.
[594.70 --> 595.72]  It's a very important detail.
[595.84 --> 597.22]  Anger is not inherently wrong.
[597.22 --> 602.52]  However, it can lead to a mountain of pain.
[602.98 --> 604.50]  It must be kept in check.
[604.64 --> 606.30]  It must eventually be dealt with.
[606.34 --> 607.16]  And I would even suggest
[607.16 --> 608.80]  if you do not deal with the anger,
[608.92 --> 609.70]  it's very unlikely
[609.70 --> 611.08]  that you will be able to reconcile
[611.08 --> 612.70]  with a brother or sister
[612.70 --> 613.66]  with whom you have conflict.
[614.76 --> 616.28]  That's why in Ephesians 4,
[616.88 --> 618.12]  when Paul is giving instruction
[618.12 --> 619.00]  to a different church,
[619.06 --> 619.46]  he says,
[619.82 --> 621.88]  in your anger, do not sin.
[622.78 --> 623.58]  Because he knows,
[623.70 --> 624.70]  as we all know,
[624.94 --> 626.12]  that when we are angry,
[626.12 --> 627.70]  when we are truly fired up,
[627.90 --> 630.42]  we make some of the worst decisions.
[630.54 --> 631.16]  Tell me I'm wrong.
[632.14 --> 633.24]  Just think of the last time
[633.24 --> 634.32]  you really got upset.
[635.78 --> 637.30]  You're going to say some words
[637.30 --> 639.78]  you never wish came out of your mouth
[639.78 --> 640.56]  when you're angry.
[641.54 --> 642.84]  You're going to send an email
[642.84 --> 644.66]  or a text you desperately wish
[644.66 --> 645.34]  you could unsend.
[645.44 --> 647.10]  In fact, the reason that Google
[647.10 --> 648.22]  and your phones give you
[648.22 --> 649.22]  the unsend function
[649.22 --> 650.14]  is because they know
[650.14 --> 651.42]  how dysfunctional we are.
[651.82 --> 652.40]  It's like, man,
[652.48 --> 653.74]  that guy should never have sent
[653.74 --> 654.76]  that email to his coworkers.
[654.76 --> 656.26]  Let's let him unsend it.
[656.84 --> 657.98]  It's not worth keeping.
[658.18 --> 658.98]  Let's unsend this.
[659.14 --> 660.64]  It's because when we say things
[660.64 --> 661.18]  when we're angry,
[661.40 --> 662.70]  we make things we regret.
[664.62 --> 665.42]  And in our anger,
[665.54 --> 666.42]  let's just name this,
[666.82 --> 668.22]  that's when we really want
[668.22 --> 669.44]  to exact revenge.
[670.58 --> 672.06]  We want to retaliate.
[672.54 --> 674.04]  We want to hit back
[674.04 --> 676.02]  the person who hit us.
[677.06 --> 678.44]  In fact, let me just remind us
[678.44 --> 679.22]  that the definition
[679.22 --> 680.16]  that we're working with
[680.16 --> 680.72]  in this series
[680.72 --> 681.54]  is that forgiveness
[681.54 --> 683.28]  is renouncing revenge
[683.28 --> 684.88]  and being open
[684.88 --> 685.66]  to reconciliation.
[686.66 --> 687.18]  And in light of that,
[687.24 --> 688.62]  I want to read how Paul then
[688.62 --> 689.76]  in verse 17 to 19
[689.76 --> 691.82]  specifically speaks
[691.82 --> 693.62]  into that anger response
[693.62 --> 694.20]  for revenge.
[694.32 --> 694.82]  He says,
[695.70 --> 697.42]  Do not repay anyone
[697.42 --> 698.42]  evil for evil.
[699.52 --> 700.70]  Be careful to do
[700.70 --> 701.20]  what is right
[701.20 --> 702.12]  in the eyes of everyone.
[702.38 --> 703.52]  If it is possible,
[704.04 --> 705.80]  as far as it depends on you,
[705.96 --> 707.66]  live at peace with everyone.
[707.66 --> 710.18]  Do not take revenge,
[710.30 --> 711.06]  my dear friends,
[711.58 --> 712.24]  but leave room
[712.24 --> 713.06]  for God's wrath,
[713.18 --> 714.00]  for it is written,
[714.58 --> 716.44]  it is mine to avenge,
[716.84 --> 718.40]  and I will repay,
[718.56 --> 719.22]  says the Lord.
[720.38 --> 721.34]  Now there's a lot
[721.34 --> 722.02]  in these short verses,
[722.10 --> 722.62]  we're going to unpack
[722.62 --> 723.12]  them together.
[723.46 --> 724.66]  But you can see Paul
[724.66 --> 726.40]  curbing that desire
[726.40 --> 727.32]  to exact revenge
[727.32 --> 727.92]  on somebody.
[728.46 --> 729.30]  Curbing that desire
[729.30 --> 730.90]  to you retaliating
[730.90 --> 731.54]  on someone.
[732.12 --> 733.58]  And I should highlight
[733.58 --> 734.56]  that we live in a culture
[734.56 --> 735.68]  where increasingly,
[735.68 --> 738.04]  it's okay just to get revenge,
[738.14 --> 738.64]  to get even,
[738.72 --> 739.66]  to punish someone back
[739.66 --> 740.64]  for how they punished you.
[740.98 --> 742.20]  And I was reminded this week,
[742.30 --> 743.36]  even in writing my sermon,
[743.84 --> 744.98]  that there are a lot
[744.98 --> 746.40]  of popular songs
[746.40 --> 748.34]  that celebrate revenge.
[749.70 --> 750.56]  I had in my head,
[750.64 --> 751.32]  I got, oh man,
[751.36 --> 752.32]  I got the name of the song
[752.32 --> 753.36]  wrong in the night a.m. service.
[754.20 --> 755.40]  Some of you know this song.
[755.70 --> 756.86]  It's the one where she
[756.86 --> 757.72]  puts the key
[757.72 --> 758.98]  in the side of his SUV.
[759.70 --> 760.38]  What's that one?
[760.62 --> 761.64]  Not Kelly Clarkson.
[763.08 --> 763.70]  Thank you.
[763.70 --> 765.02]  I knew someone would get me.
[765.68 --> 766.64]  And these songs,
[766.76 --> 767.78]  they sort of stir in us
[767.78 --> 768.64]  this imagination
[768.64 --> 769.54]  for how we could
[769.54 --> 770.84]  so cleverly get back
[770.84 --> 771.26]  at someone.
[771.38 --> 772.26]  And I want to suggest,
[772.64 --> 773.46]  just practically,
[774.20 --> 775.52]  that is the place
[775.52 --> 776.46]  where we must pray.
[777.36 --> 779.12]  Because action of revenge
[779.12 --> 780.44]  always starts with you
[780.44 --> 782.28]  desiring and imagining
[782.28 --> 783.86]  and entertaining revenge.
[784.10 --> 785.04]  And that's why in James 1
[785.04 --> 785.44]  it says,
[785.82 --> 786.58]  you are tempted
[786.58 --> 788.34]  when you're dragged away
[788.34 --> 790.26]  by your evil desires.
[790.68 --> 791.84]  And those desires
[791.84 --> 794.10]  give birth to evil sins.
[794.10 --> 794.82]  Right?
[794.92 --> 795.86]  And so we want to pray
[795.86 --> 797.42]  against that imagining,
[797.62 --> 799.40]  that desiring for that person's harm
[799.40 --> 800.76]  and how we can exact it
[800.76 --> 801.76]  because that's going to lead
[801.76 --> 802.86]  to a mountain of pain.
[803.16 --> 804.32]  And let me just say it straight.
[804.90 --> 805.96]  Revenge will never
[805.96 --> 807.36]  solve your problem.
[809.04 --> 810.06]  If you've ever tried it,
[810.10 --> 810.94]  you know this.
[811.44 --> 811.64]  Right?
[811.90 --> 812.94]  A sibling hits a sibling,
[813.06 --> 813.84]  that sibling hits them back.
[813.92 --> 814.84]  How's it going then?
[815.06 --> 815.88]  They just keep punching.
[816.68 --> 817.90]  Or as one writer puts it,
[818.40 --> 819.36]  evil keep,
[819.36 --> 819.70]  or sorry,
[819.80 --> 821.10]  revenge keeps evil
[821.10 --> 822.32]  in circulation.
[823.84 --> 824.76]  You exact revenge,
[824.86 --> 825.52]  you will just keep
[825.52 --> 826.88]  that cycle of evil going.
[827.04 --> 827.66]  You will keep
[827.66 --> 828.88]  the cultural norm
[828.88 --> 830.20]  of eye for eye,
[830.64 --> 831.48]  tooth for tooth,
[832.00 --> 832.64]  cuff for cuff,
[832.72 --> 833.24]  all that stuff
[833.24 --> 834.00]  will just keep going
[834.00 --> 835.14]  as you exact revenge.
[835.36 --> 836.32]  And it takes the ethic
[836.32 --> 837.30]  of Jesus Christ,
[838.40 --> 839.46]  the ethic of forgiving
[839.46 --> 840.14]  our enemies,
[841.06 --> 842.90]  to break that cycle.
[843.64 --> 844.62]  That's what we've been looking at
[844.62 --> 845.90]  for the last number of weeks.
[846.80 --> 847.74]  It's revenge that keeps
[847.74 --> 848.60]  couples at odds,
[848.98 --> 849.88]  families in dysfunction,
[850.22 --> 851.86]  and even nations at war.
[853.10 --> 854.06]  And just a sidebar,
[854.16 --> 854.82]  I would like to say
[854.82 --> 855.48]  more about this,
[855.54 --> 856.88]  but I find it very important
[856.88 --> 859.14]  to name that the next verse,
[859.70 --> 860.46]  like the next section
[860.46 --> 862.32]  of teaching in this passage
[862.32 --> 863.24]  is Paul saying,
[863.64 --> 864.88]  just so you know,
[865.04 --> 866.26]  God has put governing
[866.26 --> 867.36]  authorities in place
[867.36 --> 868.74]  who are in charge
[868.74 --> 869.66]  of enacting justice,
[870.00 --> 871.04]  and you need to trust
[871.04 --> 872.34]  that they will enact justice
[872.34 --> 873.56]  when you feel like you can't.
[873.84 --> 874.76]  It's an important detail.
[875.28 --> 876.30]  We have a lot of police officers
[876.30 --> 877.02]  in our church,
[877.02 --> 877.76]  I'm very grateful
[877.76 --> 879.28]  for the way that they do work
[879.28 --> 880.14]  to keep justice
[880.14 --> 881.02]  in our society.
[881.80 --> 883.00]  But what Paul focused on
[883.00 --> 883.86]  in this passage
[883.86 --> 885.84]  is actually quite a bit heavier.
[885.96 --> 886.68]  Let me read for us
[886.68 --> 887.44]  what Paul says
[887.44 --> 888.80]  in verse 19.
[889.52 --> 890.72]  Do not take revenge,
[891.32 --> 892.02]  dear friends,
[892.82 --> 894.48]  but leave room for what?
[896.06 --> 897.58]  God's wrath.
[899.26 --> 900.08]  For it is written,
[900.22 --> 901.72]  it is mine to avenge,
[902.04 --> 903.24]  and I will repay,
[903.42 --> 904.10]  says the Lord.
[904.10 --> 907.32]  That's a pretty heavy passage,
[907.42 --> 907.78]  isn't it?
[908.68 --> 909.66]  And that whenever I hit,
[909.76 --> 910.68]  this is my own personal
[910.68 --> 911.94]  working through the Bible,
[912.04 --> 913.12]  whenever I hit these passages
[913.12 --> 913.98]  that feel harsh,
[914.42 --> 915.48]  I sit with them
[915.48 --> 916.26]  because I want to know
[916.26 --> 917.00]  how is,
[917.14 --> 918.02]  why is this in the Bible,
[918.12 --> 919.42]  and how might this be good news?
[919.48 --> 920.04]  And I want to suggest,
[920.12 --> 920.60]  number one,
[920.84 --> 922.52]  this is a really important teaching
[922.52 --> 925.20]  because you and I
[925.20 --> 927.00]  are not in a position
[927.00 --> 928.14]  to judge.
[928.14 --> 931.20]  We have very skewed judgment,
[931.60 --> 932.92]  very unclear motives,
[933.10 --> 933.90]  we have all sorts
[933.90 --> 935.00]  of improper scales
[935.00 --> 935.90]  by which we measure
[935.90 --> 936.86]  people's sin
[936.86 --> 937.58]  and all the rest
[937.58 --> 938.20]  and our own.
[938.36 --> 939.52]  We are not in a position
[939.52 --> 940.34]  to judge and therefore
[940.34 --> 941.00]  make judgment
[941.00 --> 941.82]  in our revenge.
[942.42 --> 942.92]  Secondly,
[943.86 --> 945.20]  good news, church.
[945.88 --> 947.00]  There is someone
[947.00 --> 948.30]  who is the judge,
[948.52 --> 949.62]  who is perfect in love
[949.62 --> 950.72]  and infinite in wisdom,
[951.04 --> 952.24]  and he sits on the throne,
[952.46 --> 953.20]  and his judgment
[953.20 --> 954.40]  and his justice will come.
[954.40 --> 956.54]  And if you live
[956.54 --> 957.18]  in a very safe,
[957.30 --> 958.08]  comfortable environment,
[958.22 --> 958.86]  that might not feel
[958.86 --> 959.64]  like good news to you,
[959.74 --> 960.72]  but if you are impressed
[960.72 --> 962.38]  and you are in a war-torn country,
[962.48 --> 963.70]  if you've been deeply hurt
[963.70 --> 965.00]  by someone who is never
[965.00 --> 966.46]  getting to deal with that,
[966.66 --> 968.50]  you can trust that God sees,
[969.18 --> 970.00]  God knows,
[970.36 --> 971.34]  and his justice will come.
[972.62 --> 973.76]  Let me read for you a quote.
[973.84 --> 974.42]  It actually comes from
[974.42 --> 975.22]  someone in our own church.
[975.84 --> 977.04]  This is Ed Gerber,
[977.18 --> 978.40]  a chaplain at Trinity Western Office.
[978.56 --> 979.36]  He's here somewhere this Sunday.
[980.08 --> 981.38]  But this is just something
[981.38 --> 982.60]  he's written in his own work
[982.60 --> 984.10]  on Matthew 5 and anger.
[984.40 --> 984.86]  He writes,
[985.64 --> 987.16]  I need not hold
[987.16 --> 989.44]  onto the righteous anger
[989.44 --> 991.26]  and act on it
[991.26 --> 992.28]  to bring balance
[992.28 --> 993.46]  back to the universe.
[994.44 --> 997.20]  God will hold it for me.
[998.76 --> 999.60]  And just allow that
[999.60 --> 1000.18]  to sit with you.
[1000.32 --> 1001.82]  Whatever deep conflict
[1001.82 --> 1002.20]  you are in,
[1002.26 --> 1003.40]  God will hold it for you
[1003.40 --> 1005.04]  and act on it in his way,
[1005.34 --> 1006.42]  in his own timing,
[1006.42 --> 1009.80]  and with his own infinite wisdom.
[1010.98 --> 1012.36]  That's good news, church.
[1013.08 --> 1013.48]  Humbling,
[1014.10 --> 1014.74]  a bit scary,
[1014.82 --> 1015.26]  you might say,
[1015.30 --> 1016.12]  because all of us
[1016.12 --> 1017.62]  face the justice of God
[1017.62 --> 1018.40]  in its own way.
[1018.76 --> 1020.04]  But I would also add this.
[1020.40 --> 1021.72]  We can live with injustice
[1021.72 --> 1022.96]  because we know justice
[1022.96 --> 1023.80]  will one day come.
[1024.80 --> 1026.04]  If there is no king
[1026.04 --> 1027.16]  who rules the world,
[1027.26 --> 1028.74]  who rules over all of humanity,
[1028.98 --> 1029.74]  who has no interest
[1029.74 --> 1030.82]  in establishing justice,
[1031.02 --> 1032.40]  we will need to take revenge
[1032.40 --> 1033.30]  or feel the need
[1033.30 --> 1034.32]  to stand up for ourselves
[1034.32 --> 1035.36]  in all these situations
[1035.36 --> 1035.80]  of evil.
[1035.80 --> 1037.56]  But because we live
[1037.56 --> 1038.92]  under a just God
[1038.92 --> 1040.62]  who has promised
[1040.62 --> 1041.38]  his return,
[1042.10 --> 1043.34]  we can live with injustice
[1043.34 --> 1044.10]  knowing that it's
[1044.10 --> 1044.88]  in his hands
[1044.88 --> 1046.10]  in his time.
[1049.06 --> 1051.40]  Now, between these two statements,
[1051.70 --> 1052.82]  to not exact revenge,
[1052.96 --> 1054.32]  to not repay evil for evil,
[1054.80 --> 1056.42]  Paul makes this very honest
[1056.42 --> 1057.42]  and important statement
[1057.42 --> 1058.80]  about making peace.
[1058.88 --> 1059.62]  This is what he says,
[1059.70 --> 1060.26]  verse 18.
[1060.26 --> 1063.86]  If it is possible,
[1064.60 --> 1068.18]  as far as it depends on you,
[1069.24 --> 1070.44]  live at peace with everybody.
[1072.14 --> 1073.14]  My mom would say
[1073.14 --> 1074.12]  that's her theme verse.
[1074.94 --> 1075.80]  And she grows up
[1075.80 --> 1077.20]  and lives in a dysfunctional family
[1077.20 --> 1077.92]  just like you do.
[1079.20 --> 1080.96]  And how wonderful would it be
[1080.96 --> 1081.90]  if most of us saw
[1081.90 --> 1083.00]  that function in our lives
[1083.00 --> 1084.02]  of being peacemakers
[1084.02 --> 1085.94]  in a world of increasing
[1085.94 --> 1088.26]  canceling and increasing conflict.
[1088.26 --> 1090.42]  But what I appreciate
[1090.42 --> 1091.26]  about this statement
[1091.26 --> 1092.90]  is Paul is being honest
[1092.90 --> 1094.74]  that there are circumstances
[1094.74 --> 1096.96]  that are beyond your control
[1096.96 --> 1099.34]  that you cannot make peace in
[1099.34 --> 1100.12]  in this moment.
[1100.98 --> 1102.20]  There are circumstances
[1102.20 --> 1103.08]  where you have gone
[1103.08 --> 1105.10]  as far as is possible
[1105.10 --> 1107.40]  to forgive from the heart,
[1107.56 --> 1108.58]  to renounce revenge,
[1108.76 --> 1110.08]  to build reconciliation,
[1110.56 --> 1111.86]  and because of the person
[1111.86 --> 1112.90]  on the other side
[1112.90 --> 1114.30]  or the situation
[1114.30 --> 1115.14]  you're involved in,
[1115.40 --> 1116.64]  that is not in this moment
[1116.64 --> 1117.14]  possible.
[1118.26 --> 1120.28]  And that means
[1120.28 --> 1121.14]  there are situations
[1121.14 --> 1122.80]  where you forgive your spouse
[1122.80 --> 1124.06]  of 20 plus years,
[1124.46 --> 1126.14]  but for the sake of your safety
[1126.14 --> 1126.74]  and well-being,
[1127.08 --> 1128.28]  you separate or divorce.
[1129.86 --> 1130.78]  That also means
[1130.78 --> 1132.00]  that you forgive your parent
[1132.00 --> 1132.64]  or your sibling
[1132.64 --> 1134.34]  for the way that they've hurt you,
[1135.04 --> 1135.92]  but you put boundaries
[1135.92 --> 1136.94]  around your communication.
[1138.32 --> 1139.88]  That means you forgive your friend
[1139.88 --> 1141.56]  who was once your best friend
[1141.56 --> 1142.10]  for years,
[1142.24 --> 1143.02]  but the nature of that
[1143.02 --> 1143.94]  relationship changes.
[1143.94 --> 1145.42]  Or you forgive your pastor
[1145.42 --> 1146.90]  for what has taken place,
[1146.98 --> 1147.46]  but you worship
[1147.46 --> 1148.36]  in a different church.
[1148.90 --> 1150.10]  Because you've gone
[1150.10 --> 1151.36]  as far as possible,
[1151.82 --> 1153.50]  and the rest is now
[1153.50 --> 1154.00]  in the hands
[1154.00 --> 1154.80]  of that other person
[1154.80 --> 1155.76]  or that other party.
[1156.82 --> 1158.22]  You cannot change
[1158.22 --> 1159.18]  someone else's behavior,
[1159.28 --> 1159.90]  but you can go
[1159.90 --> 1161.10]  as far as you can.
[1161.32 --> 1162.90]  And there are many circumstances
[1162.90 --> 1165.02]  where even people
[1165.02 --> 1165.74]  in our church
[1165.74 --> 1167.32]  have gone as far as possible.
[1167.42 --> 1168.02]  And maybe this is
[1168.02 --> 1168.76]  what I need to say.
[1169.62 --> 1170.98]  If you are that person
[1170.98 --> 1171.98]  who has done everything
[1171.98 --> 1173.42]  you can towards reconciliation,
[1174.22 --> 1174.98]  true forgiveness,
[1175.36 --> 1176.56]  not seeking revenge,
[1177.14 --> 1178.92]  God sees that.
[1180.24 --> 1181.40]  And He knows.
[1182.58 --> 1184.12]  No one else might see it.
[1184.68 --> 1185.32]  The other person
[1185.32 --> 1185.92]  you're in conflict
[1185.92 --> 1186.78]  might twist it
[1186.78 --> 1187.52]  and all the rest,
[1187.62 --> 1188.98]  but God knows exactly
[1188.98 --> 1189.90]  what you've gone through
[1189.90 --> 1191.42]  and the way that you have
[1191.42 --> 1192.64]  sought to be faithful
[1192.64 --> 1193.42]  to Jesus
[1193.42 --> 1195.50]  in the midst of conflict.
[1196.22 --> 1197.08]  I think some of us
[1197.08 --> 1197.92]  need to hear that.
[1198.76 --> 1200.50]  I'm also guessing
[1200.50 --> 1201.74]  that most of us
[1201.74 --> 1203.40]  need to hear exactly
[1203.40 --> 1204.04]  how it is
[1204.04 --> 1205.16]  that Paul's saying it.
[1205.90 --> 1209.14]  To go as far as we can.
[1210.26 --> 1211.94]  To build the bridge.
[1212.52 --> 1213.40]  To open the door
[1213.40 --> 1214.22]  for reconciliation.
[1214.90 --> 1216.20]  To start the conversation.
[1217.14 --> 1218.70]  It's my pastoral gut
[1218.70 --> 1220.14]  that says most of us
[1220.14 --> 1221.52]  don't give reconciliation
[1221.52 --> 1223.10]  enough time.
[1223.64 --> 1225.52]  We don't give it enough work.
[1226.48 --> 1227.34]  And so practically,
[1227.34 --> 1229.02]  I think if we're hearing
[1229.02 --> 1229.90]  Paul correctly,
[1230.32 --> 1231.86]  it's saying that we should
[1231.86 --> 1232.42]  reach out
[1232.42 --> 1234.32]  to those with whom
[1234.32 --> 1235.36]  we might have conflict.
[1236.12 --> 1237.46]  To set up the coffee.
[1238.56 --> 1240.34]  To open up that conversation.
[1241.14 --> 1243.26]  To have that talk.
[1244.00 --> 1244.76]  And just again,
[1244.82 --> 1246.76]  a little pastoral sidebar here.
[1247.32 --> 1248.76]  Don't do this by text.
[1249.80 --> 1250.90]  How many of you
[1250.90 --> 1252.32]  have had a deeply reconciling
[1252.32 --> 1253.72]  conversation by text?
[1255.00 --> 1256.34]  That's what I thought.
[1257.62 --> 1258.62]  In person,
[1259.04 --> 1259.80]  if possible,
[1260.02 --> 1260.64]  by phone,
[1260.72 --> 1261.42]  if necessary,
[1261.76 --> 1262.64]  do not text
[1262.64 --> 1264.16]  unless you absolutely have to.
[1264.68 --> 1265.98]  I've seen so many
[1265.98 --> 1267.26]  would-be possible
[1267.26 --> 1268.50]  reconciling situations
[1268.50 --> 1269.16]  go sideways
[1269.16 --> 1270.56]  when someone sends a text
[1270.56 --> 1271.26]  that can be misread,
[1271.36 --> 1271.76]  misunderstood,
[1272.00 --> 1272.84]  and deepened the divide.
[1272.84 --> 1275.36]  If communication
[1275.36 --> 1276.34]  has broken down,
[1277.36 --> 1278.66]  that's when you call
[1278.66 --> 1279.24]  the counselor
[1279.24 --> 1281.00]  or the family mediator.
[1281.10 --> 1281.82]  And I'm delighted,
[1281.96 --> 1282.26]  by the way,
[1282.30 --> 1283.06]  that it just so happens
[1283.06 --> 1283.60]  that this Sunday
[1283.60 --> 1284.10]  is a Sunday
[1284.10 --> 1285.12]  where we're giving
[1285.12 --> 1285.36]  to,
[1285.54 --> 1286.76]  not Peace Portal Counseling,
[1286.86 --> 1288.10]  to Soul Matters Counseling,
[1288.46 --> 1288.80]  Elsha,
[1288.90 --> 1289.84]  who's running that,
[1289.98 --> 1290.70]  she is a member
[1290.70 --> 1291.28]  of our church,
[1291.52 --> 1292.36]  and we are delighted
[1292.36 --> 1293.06]  that we can use
[1293.06 --> 1294.08]  the funds in our church
[1294.08 --> 1295.18]  to bless people
[1295.18 --> 1296.10]  to receive the care
[1296.10 --> 1296.48]  they need
[1296.48 --> 1297.50]  when they can't talk,
[1297.66 --> 1298.48]  when the communication
[1298.48 --> 1299.34]  is broken down.
[1300.14 --> 1301.22]  In my own family,
[1301.66 --> 1302.66]  we brought in a counselor
[1302.66 --> 1303.76]  to help some wounds
[1303.76 --> 1305.24]  in our family system.
[1305.64 --> 1306.28]  Family mediators
[1306.28 --> 1307.18]  are a great gift
[1307.18 --> 1307.66]  to families
[1307.66 --> 1308.38]  when communication
[1308.38 --> 1309.18]  is broken down.
[1309.56 --> 1310.44]  Do not hesitate
[1310.44 --> 1312.08]  to take those steps
[1312.08 --> 1314.48]  and see what could be possible
[1314.48 --> 1316.60]  if we open the door
[1316.60 --> 1317.56]  towards reconciliation.
[1319.38 --> 1320.76]  Two things I want to note,
[1321.46 --> 1322.26]  one's in our passage,
[1322.38 --> 1323.34]  one's in my own experience.
[1323.94 --> 1325.56]  One is that Paul invites us
[1325.56 --> 1326.56]  to kindness.
[1328.16 --> 1329.30]  Not only do we relinquish
[1329.30 --> 1329.92]  revenge,
[1330.90 --> 1332.10]  but we find ways
[1332.10 --> 1333.02]  to be kind.
[1334.54 --> 1335.68]  I find that striking.
[1336.44 --> 1337.56]  And I think that also starts
[1337.56 --> 1338.34]  in the area of desire
[1338.34 --> 1340.02]  where you feel those desires
[1340.02 --> 1341.60]  for retaliation or revenge,
[1341.76 --> 1342.54]  to scrape the key
[1342.54 --> 1343.48]  in the side of their car.
[1343.68 --> 1344.86]  That's when you ask the Lord,
[1345.26 --> 1346.68]  how can I express kindness
[1346.68 --> 1347.18]  to them?
[1348.62 --> 1349.14]  And secondly,
[1349.30 --> 1350.26]  just in my own experience,
[1350.38 --> 1350.96]  what I have found
[1350.96 --> 1351.58]  in situations
[1351.58 --> 1352.56]  where there's real conflict,
[1352.70 --> 1353.66]  and this is my own story,
[1354.78 --> 1356.18]  if you feel like you've been hurt,
[1356.30 --> 1357.36]  in most cases,
[1357.44 --> 1357.96]  not all,
[1357.96 --> 1359.24]  but in most cases,
[1359.34 --> 1360.88]  there's something you can own.
[1361.54 --> 1362.52]  And when you come back
[1362.52 --> 1363.20]  to a relationship
[1363.20 --> 1363.84]  where you feel like
[1363.84 --> 1364.68]  you've been deeply wounded
[1364.68 --> 1366.14]  and you start that conversation
[1366.14 --> 1366.70]  by saying,
[1366.84 --> 1367.02]  look,
[1367.46 --> 1368.50]  I want to apologize
[1368.50 --> 1369.74]  and ask for your forgiveness
[1369.74 --> 1370.88]  for what I have done,
[1371.30 --> 1372.78]  that opens up the door
[1372.78 --> 1373.44]  for vulnerability
[1373.44 --> 1374.82]  and reciprocity
[1374.82 --> 1376.82]  and reconciliation.
[1376.82 --> 1378.60]  And I'm guessing
[1378.60 --> 1379.90]  that there's a lot of us
[1379.90 --> 1381.82]  that are holding this huge grudge
[1381.82 --> 1382.82]  over somebody else
[1382.82 --> 1384.06]  and there's much
[1384.06 --> 1384.94]  that we can own
[1384.94 --> 1386.46]  and apologize for
[1386.46 --> 1387.50]  and in so doing,
[1387.62 --> 1388.26]  open the door
[1388.26 --> 1389.24]  for reconciliation
[1389.24 --> 1390.20]  and healing.
[1391.56 --> 1393.22]  Are you willing to do that?
[1394.38 --> 1395.98]  Are you willing to do
[1395.98 --> 1397.04]  the work of going
[1397.04 --> 1397.86]  as far
[1397.86 --> 1399.26]  as is possible,
[1399.26 --> 1400.40]  as much
[1400.40 --> 1401.34]  as it depends
[1401.34 --> 1401.88]  on you
[1401.88 --> 1403.52]  to make peace
[1403.52 --> 1404.16]  with your brother
[1404.16 --> 1405.42]  or your sister?
[1408.96 --> 1409.96]  William Barclay
[1409.96 --> 1410.60]  in his commentary
[1410.60 --> 1411.38]  on this passage,
[1411.46 --> 1411.72]  he says,
[1411.82 --> 1411.96]  you know,
[1412.04 --> 1412.96]  vengeance may break
[1412.96 --> 1413.72]  someone's spirit,
[1414.54 --> 1415.10]  but kindness
[1415.10 --> 1416.30]  will break their heart.
[1417.36 --> 1418.04]  And kindness
[1418.04 --> 1418.62]  from an enemy
[1418.62 --> 1419.02]  is a way
[1419.02 --> 1420.04]  of confounding us
[1420.04 --> 1420.74]  with this ethic
[1420.74 --> 1421.24]  of the kingdom
[1421.24 --> 1422.56]  of Jesus Christ
[1422.56 --> 1423.96]  and opening people
[1423.96 --> 1424.76]  to a way
[1424.76 --> 1425.38]  of reconciliation.
[1428.78 --> 1429.76]  I want to finish
[1429.76 --> 1430.86]  by drawing our attention
[1430.86 --> 1432.60]  back to Jesus.
[1434.52 --> 1435.94]  Jesus did not only
[1435.94 --> 1437.92]  teach us extensively
[1437.92 --> 1439.42]  about how to forgive.
[1439.66 --> 1439.92]  In fact,
[1440.00 --> 1440.62]  you should notice,
[1440.72 --> 1441.02]  by the way,
[1441.06 --> 1441.82]  in this sermon series,
[1442.14 --> 1443.20]  we have tried to focus
[1443.20 --> 1444.04]  very carefully
[1444.04 --> 1444.76]  on the teaching
[1444.76 --> 1445.26]  of Jesus
[1445.26 --> 1446.20]  in Matthew 6
[1446.20 --> 1447.32]  and Matthew 18
[1447.32 --> 1448.02]  and elsewhere
[1448.02 --> 1449.28]  on specifically
[1449.28 --> 1450.30]  how we are to forgive,
[1450.48 --> 1451.46]  how we are to reconcile,
[1451.60 --> 1452.46]  how we are to give
[1452.46 --> 1453.24]  a release
[1453.24 --> 1453.88]  of our vengeance.
[1455.32 --> 1456.02]  But Jesus
[1456.02 --> 1457.28]  didn't just teach that.
[1458.32 --> 1459.36]  He did that.
[1460.60 --> 1461.38]  Jesus asks
[1461.38 --> 1462.64]  nothing of us
[1462.64 --> 1463.44]  that he didn't
[1463.44 --> 1464.96]  model for us
[1464.96 --> 1465.98]  in his own ministry.
[1467.34 --> 1467.78]  And I think
[1467.78 --> 1468.50]  we just need to pause
[1468.50 --> 1469.12]  and realize
[1469.12 --> 1469.90]  that there is
[1469.90 --> 1471.66]  a very good chance
[1471.66 --> 1472.20]  that you and I
[1472.20 --> 1472.98]  will never
[1472.98 --> 1474.48]  comprehend
[1474.48 --> 1476.02]  the betrayal
[1476.02 --> 1476.90]  and the injustice
[1476.90 --> 1478.20]  that Jesus experienced.
[1479.54 --> 1480.66]  It's very unlikely
[1480.66 --> 1481.42]  that you will ever
[1481.42 --> 1482.38]  wrap your head around
[1482.38 --> 1483.46]  the way Jesus
[1483.46 --> 1484.18]  was betrayed
[1484.18 --> 1485.60]  by his enemies,
[1486.20 --> 1487.96]  by his Jewish leaders,
[1488.24 --> 1489.76]  by his own disciples.
[1490.94 --> 1491.94]  That he was brought
[1491.94 --> 1492.50]  to sort of this
[1492.50 --> 1493.06]  mock,
[1493.22 --> 1493.80]  make-up,
[1494.00 --> 1494.74]  pseudo-court
[1494.74 --> 1495.42]  in the middle
[1495.42 --> 1495.98]  of the night
[1495.98 --> 1496.74]  with Jewish leaders
[1496.74 --> 1497.94]  who just wanted him dead.
[1498.22 --> 1498.84]  That he was put
[1498.84 --> 1500.24]  before these Roman officials
[1500.24 --> 1501.38]  who didn't,
[1501.68 --> 1501.96]  or sorry,
[1502.06 --> 1502.64]  who don't even,
[1502.86 --> 1503.76]  they knew that Jesus
[1503.76 --> 1504.32]  was innocent
[1504.32 --> 1505.56]  but would rather not
[1505.56 --> 1506.76]  deal with the work
[1506.76 --> 1508.00]  of all that.
[1508.00 --> 1508.92]  so they just released
[1508.92 --> 1510.12]  Jesus to be flogged,
[1510.30 --> 1510.76]  mocked,
[1511.10 --> 1511.42]  beaten,
[1511.86 --> 1512.84]  and eventually nailed
[1512.84 --> 1513.66]  to a cross
[1513.66 --> 1515.10]  in public shame
[1515.10 --> 1515.80]  and humiliation.
[1516.32 --> 1517.42]  We will never
[1517.42 --> 1519.16]  comprehend
[1519.16 --> 1521.24]  that kind of betrayal,
[1522.20 --> 1523.46]  that kind of sin,
[1524.02 --> 1525.22]  that kind of wound.
[1527.34 --> 1527.74]  And yet,
[1527.80 --> 1528.58]  this is the one
[1528.58 --> 1529.60]  who invites us
[1529.60 --> 1530.48]  to forgive.
[1530.48 --> 1533.38]  This is the one
[1533.38 --> 1534.02]  who invites us
[1534.02 --> 1535.92]  to follow him.
[1537.14 --> 1537.90]  And I want to read
[1537.90 --> 1538.38]  for you
[1538.38 --> 1539.52]  some of my favorite
[1539.52 --> 1540.44]  words from 1 Peter.
[1541.66 --> 1542.60]  This is how 1 Peter
[1542.60 --> 1543.44]  describes
[1543.44 --> 1544.48]  the ministry of Jesus
[1544.48 --> 1545.56]  as it then moves
[1545.56 --> 1546.20]  to the church.
[1546.68 --> 1547.10]  And this is
[1547.10 --> 1548.36]  in a section of teaching
[1548.36 --> 1549.18]  called Suffering
[1549.18 --> 1549.92]  for Doing Good.
[1551.02 --> 1551.98]  1 Peter 2,
[1552.06 --> 1552.58]  verse 21,
[1552.70 --> 1552.98]  we read,
[1553.06 --> 1553.76]  But if you suffer
[1553.76 --> 1554.60]  for doing good
[1554.60 --> 1555.44]  and you endure it,
[1555.52 --> 1556.48]  this is commendable
[1556.48 --> 1557.24]  before God.
[1558.20 --> 1559.44]  To this you were called
[1559.44 --> 1560.98]  because Christ
[1560.98 --> 1562.06]  suffered for you,
[1562.68 --> 1563.60]  leaving you
[1563.60 --> 1564.32]  an example
[1564.32 --> 1565.56]  that you should
[1565.56 --> 1566.76]  follow in his steps.
[1567.52 --> 1568.46]  I was quoting Isaiah.
[1568.72 --> 1569.98]  He committed no sin.
[1571.34 --> 1572.36]  No deceit
[1572.36 --> 1573.10]  was found
[1573.10 --> 1573.92]  in his mouth.
[1574.94 --> 1576.16]  When they hurled
[1576.16 --> 1577.58]  insults at him,
[1578.32 --> 1579.60]  he did not retaliate.
[1580.96 --> 1582.12]  When he suffered,
[1582.80 --> 1584.30]  he made no threats.
[1585.40 --> 1585.82]  Instead,
[1586.14 --> 1587.42]  he entrusted himself
[1587.42 --> 1588.20]  to the one
[1588.20 --> 1589.04]  who judges
[1589.04 --> 1590.12]  justly.
[1591.32 --> 1592.16]  He himself
[1592.16 --> 1593.28]  bore our sins
[1593.28 --> 1594.28]  in his body
[1594.28 --> 1595.20]  on the cross
[1595.20 --> 1596.14]  in order that
[1596.14 --> 1597.20]  we might die
[1597.20 --> 1598.00]  to sins
[1598.00 --> 1599.16]  and live
[1599.16 --> 1600.62]  for righteousness.
[1602.00 --> 1604.88]  By his wounds,
[1605.58 --> 1607.54]  you have been healed.
[1609.54 --> 1611.66]  And it's out of his healing
[1611.66 --> 1614.26]  that we can extend
[1614.26 --> 1615.64]  that kind of grace.
[1615.64 --> 1617.84]  we can forgive
[1617.84 --> 1619.40]  from our hearts.
[1620.18 --> 1621.86]  We can relinquish
[1621.86 --> 1622.60]  our desire
[1622.60 --> 1623.52]  for revenge
[1623.52 --> 1625.48]  and open the door
[1625.48 --> 1627.00]  for reconciliation.
[1627.96 --> 1629.76]  Whatever the relationship,
[1630.56 --> 1631.46]  whatever the conflict.
[1633.84 --> 1635.04]  Let me lead us
[1635.04 --> 1635.56]  in prayer.
[1635.56 --> 1645.70]  Father,
[1645.78 --> 1646.30]  it's hard for us
[1646.30 --> 1646.86]  to comprehend
[1646.86 --> 1647.94]  how Jesus did that,
[1648.72 --> 1650.98]  how he absorbed
[1650.98 --> 1652.52]  sin without retaliating,
[1653.90 --> 1655.22]  how he made no threats
[1655.22 --> 1656.06]  and entrusted
[1656.06 --> 1656.78]  his life
[1656.78 --> 1658.10]  and justice
[1658.10 --> 1658.74]  to you.
[1660.74 --> 1661.18]  Lord,
[1661.32 --> 1661.76]  teach us
[1661.76 --> 1662.32]  to follow
[1662.32 --> 1663.18]  in his way.
[1663.18 --> 1665.70]  teach us
[1665.70 --> 1666.32]  to forgive
[1666.32 --> 1667.02]  our neighbors
[1667.02 --> 1668.70]  and our enemies.
[1669.66 --> 1670.46]  Teach us
[1670.46 --> 1670.94]  to forgive
[1670.94 --> 1672.20]  from the heart.
[1673.64 --> 1674.26]  Teach us
[1674.26 --> 1675.56]  to lead
[1675.56 --> 1676.34]  in the way
[1676.34 --> 1677.46]  of reconciliation
[1677.46 --> 1678.50]  and to go
[1678.50 --> 1679.34]  as far
[1679.34 --> 1681.38]  as is possible
[1681.38 --> 1683.00]  to make peace.
[1684.56 --> 1686.08]  We desperately
[1686.08 --> 1687.02]  need you
[1687.02 --> 1688.88]  to make us
[1688.88 --> 1689.48]  do this.
[1689.48 --> 1691.18]  we desperately
[1691.18 --> 1692.08]  need your
[1692.08 --> 1692.78]  spirit
[1692.78 --> 1694.34]  to change
[1694.34 --> 1695.18]  our hearts
[1695.18 --> 1696.30]  that are
[1696.30 --> 1697.12]  full of hate
[1697.12 --> 1698.66]  that hold on
[1698.66 --> 1699.38]  to grudges
[1699.38 --> 1700.52]  and entertain
[1700.52 --> 1701.32]  revenge.
[1702.12 --> 1702.94]  So have your
[1702.94 --> 1703.78]  way with us,
[1705.04 --> 1705.82]  transform us
[1705.82 --> 1706.66]  by your grace
[1706.66 --> 1708.24]  and make us
[1708.24 --> 1708.66]  instruments
[1708.66 --> 1709.38]  of peace.
[1710.02 --> 1711.18]  We pray in the name
[1711.18 --> 1712.14]  of Jesus Christ.
[1712.54 --> 1712.84]  Amen.
[1712.84 --> 1715.96]  We're going
[1715.96 --> 1716.44]  to sing
[1716.44 --> 1717.00]  as a song
[1717.00 --> 1717.60]  of response
[1717.60 --> 1718.30]  a fairly
[1718.30 --> 1719.14]  new song.
[1719.32 --> 1719.86]  We sang this
[1719.86 --> 1720.56]  over Easter.
[1720.80 --> 1721.28]  It's called
[1721.28 --> 1722.60]  Christ Was
[1722.60 --> 1723.34]  Lower Still.
[1724.20 --> 1724.58]  And there's
[1724.58 --> 1725.02]  this line
[1725.02 --> 1725.34]  in there
[1725.34 --> 1725.88]  that gets me
[1725.88 --> 1726.28]  every time
[1726.28 --> 1726.96]  I sing it
[1726.96 --> 1728.20]  where it says
[1728.20 --> 1730.04]  in his wounds
[1730.04 --> 1731.02]  I find
[1731.02 --> 1732.30]  room for
[1732.30 --> 1733.70]  all of mine
[1733.70 --> 1734.62]  where from
[1734.62 --> 1735.92]  grace I fell
[1735.92 --> 1737.28]  Christ was
[1737.28 --> 1738.60]  lower still.
[1739.28 --> 1740.06]  So if you're
[1740.06 --> 1740.78]  learning the song
[1740.78 --> 1741.26]  just sing it
[1741.26 --> 1741.78]  along with us.
[1741.78 --> 1742.38]  If you know it,
[1742.62 --> 1743.14]  let's sing this
[1743.14 --> 1743.62]  as our song
[1743.62 --> 1744.20]  of response.
