[0.00 → 4.36] Good morning.
[6.12 → 10.18] It's a privilege to gather again together,
[10.52 → 13.86] and it's always such a pleasure to see you all
[13.86 → 17.38] and to be reminded what a gift community is.
[19.76 → 23.74] I hope everyone survived the first week of school again
[23.74 → 25.18] and back to normal.
[25.90 → 27.34] That's a good thing again.
[27.34 → 29.62] It always feels more like a new year now
[29.62 → 30.90] than it does in January.
[31.46 → 33.22] This feels like the new year to me.
[33.82 → 35.32] I was a teacher for many, many years,
[35.54 → 37.96] and even as a church staff, we always feel,
[38.06 → 38.96] okay, we're starting again.
[39.04 → 40.94] The new year is starting, so here we are.
[41.60 → 43.28] But as we begin this new year,
[43.94 → 46.26] we are concluding our summer series
[46.26 → 48.30] on the hard sayings of Jesus.
[49.36 → 52.24] We hope that this series has been helpful to you
[52.24 → 53.72] to give you some things to think about,
[54.32 → 56.10] and I hope today is helpful as well.
[56.52 → 58.88] So let's read our passage for today.
[58.88 → 59.88] Matthew 16.
[59.88 → 61.64] Out of Matthew 16.
[62.16 → 64.52] If you want to look in your own Bibles,
[64.60 → 65.90] or it will be up on the screen here,
[66.32 → 69.44] Matthew 16, the verses 13 through 21.
[71.80 → 75.56] When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi,
[75.80 → 77.30] he asked his disciples,
[78.20 → 80.90] who do people say the Son of Man is?
[80.90 → 83.12] And they replied,
[83.12 → 84.40] some say John the Baptist,
[84.56 → 85.62] others say Elijah,
[86.14 → 88.48] and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.
[90.12 → 91.50] What about you, he asked?
[92.08 → 93.94] Who do you say I am?
[95.94 → 97.34] And Simon Peter answered,
[97.86 → 98.90] you are the Messiah,
[99.46 → 101.16] the Son of the living God.
[101.16 → 103.64] And Jesus replied,
[103.78 → 104.62] blessed are you,
[104.72 → 105.72] Simon the son of Jonah,
[105.94 → 108.62] for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood,
[108.70 → 110.32] but by my Father in heaven.
[110.64 → 113.56] And I tell you that you are Peter,
[114.28 → 114.96] he means rock,
[115.00 → 117.08] and on this rock I will build my church,
[117.32 → 119.94] and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
[120.80 → 122.82] And I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven,
[122.92 → 124.78] and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven,
[124.88 → 127.30] and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
[127.30 → 131.08] And then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
[131.72 → 132.98] And from that time on,
[133.02 → 134.76] Jesus began to explain to his disciples
[134.76 → 136.48] that he must go to Jerusalem,
[136.74 → 138.72] suffer many things at the hands of the elders,
[139.14 → 139.92] and the chief priests,
[139.96 → 140.84] and the teachers of the law,
[141.08 → 142.30] and that he must be killed,
[142.42 → 144.92] and on the third day be raised to life.
[147.08 → 148.34] So there's our passage.
[149.82 → 150.76] As the title says,
[150.82 → 152.24] on this rock I will build my church,
[152.32 → 154.50] so we're kind of going to look especially at that part.
[154.96 → 157.00] But I'd like to deal with just a few things
[157.00 → 157.88] in this passage,
[158.48 → 161.08] but first I want to start with this opening scene.
[161.40 → 162.66] I want you to be able to see it.
[162.94 → 164.06] So we've got a picture up here.
[167.44 → 169.36] Jesus and his disciples are here,
[170.88 → 172.52] standing in front of this cave,
[172.60 → 174.54] which contained a very deep pool
[174.54 → 177.52] that supposedly couldn't be measured.
[177.52 → 181.44] That's according to the Jewish Roman historian Josephus.
[182.10 → 185.26] It was believed to be the gates of hell,
[185.26 → 188.88] the way to the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology.
[189.66 → 191.62] You can see it had several niches,
[191.70 → 192.84] or little window things,
[193.38 → 198.78] and those held images of the gods Pan, Echo, and Hermes.
[199.36 → 201.98] Those who know your mythology will recognize those names.
[201.98 → 203.76] Herod the Great,
[204.28 → 205.88] and then his son Herod Philip,
[206.24 → 208.26] built a complex of buildings there,
[208.60 → 210.38] some of the residents of a palace,
[211.14 → 212.72] another part was a temple,
[213.66 → 215.90] and he was trying to honour Caesar.
[216.52 → 217.58] So there he's foreign name,
[218.14 → 219.36] Caesarea Caesar,
[219.66 → 220.88] but notice Caesar Philippi,
[220.96 → 222.48] so he honoured himself while he was at it too.
[222.48 → 226.62] And they have all sorts of crazy,
[226.84 → 230.68] pagan, awful stuff happening around here.
[233.34 → 235.98] And here's where Jesus takes his disciples
[235.98 → 238.04] for a field trip.
[239.40 → 240.76] Crazy place to be, right?
[242.28 → 244.14] And he takes the time here,
[244.40 → 246.36] so picture yourself standing there,
[246.46 → 248.02] there you are by the gates of hell,
[248.40 → 248.98] and Jesus says,
[248.98 → 251.96] so who do people say I am?
[253.32 → 254.96] Here, at the gates of hell,
[255.02 → 256.06] let me ask you this question.
[257.56 → 259.32] Here, among these pagan idols
[259.32 → 261.06] that are still visible today,
[262.86 → 265.40] Rome had this big tent kind of perspective
[265.40 → 266.42] when it came to religions.
[266.56 → 267.76] Whatever god you worship,
[267.88 → 268.64] that was fine,
[268.70 → 269.76] as long as you participated
[269.76 → 273.44] in the civic aspects of Roman religious life,
[273.58 → 276.06] and as long as you recognized Caesar as Lord,
[276.18 → 276.84] then you were fine.
[277.20 → 278.64] Rome was about options.
[278.64 → 279.92] You can do you,
[279.98 → 281.44] as long as you include us.
[282.86 → 284.60] And Jesus seems to be asking,
[285.28 → 288.46] so am I just another one of the options?
[290.72 → 293.26] I'm just another choice among many.
[293.88 → 296.66] Who do people say I am?
[297.96 → 300.28] Jesus asks of his identity
[300.28 → 303.66] in a place far removed from the Jewish heartland.
[303.74 → 305.56] He's in the midst of what you might call
[305.56 → 307.32] enemy territory, as far as that goes.
[307.32 → 308.36] And notice,
[308.36 → 308.38] and notice,
[308.38 → 310.06] he goes out there.
[310.52 → 312.56] I think that's important for churches to realize.
[312.90 → 314.62] Jesus is stepping into it,
[314.96 → 316.20] not hunkering down and hiding.
[316.76 → 317.38] And the disciples,
[317.54 → 318.42] they respond to the question,
[318.52 → 320.26] who do they say I am?
[320.28 → 320.40] They say,
[320.44 → 321.78] well, some think you're John the Baptist
[321.78 → 322.58] who's come back to life,
[322.92 → 323.96] proclaiming the Messiah again.
[324.24 → 325.48] Some think you're like Elijah,
[325.84 → 326.90] fiercely righteous prophet.
[327.02 → 327.74] Some think Jeremiah,
[327.86 → 328.80] the suffering prophet.
[329.36 → 330.18] Basically saying,
[330.72 → 330.96] yeah,
[331.10 → 332.42] they kind of think you're another prophet.
[332.42 → 335.66] This question Jesus asked,
[335.70 → 337.24] I think also has a feel for this.
[337.68 → 338.98] Who rules?
[339.72 → 340.18] Herod?
[341.34 → 341.78] Caesar?
[342.58 → 343.06] Philip?
[343.62 → 344.48] These gods?
[344.98 → 345.44] Or
[345.44 → 347.14] something else?
[349.46 → 350.72] And then Jesus gets it personal.
[350.88 → 351.08] He says,
[351.16 → 351.30] now,
[351.74 → 351.98] okay,
[352.04 → 352.74] let me ask you this.
[353.02 → 355.08] Who do you say I am?
[355.08 → 357.86] Who do you say I am?
[358.60 → 359.74] Why do you follow me,
[359.80 → 359.98] really?
[361.12 → 363.20] The disciples are silent for a while
[363.20 → 364.42] until Peter confesses,
[364.46 → 364.90] and he says,
[365.28 → 366.14] very famous line,
[366.54 → 367.44] you are the Christ,
[367.54 → 368.06] the Messiah,
[368.50 → 370.60] son of the living God.
[372.30 → 373.18] Jesus says,
[373.84 → 375.78] Peter's answer is true,
[376.16 → 377.28] and he reminds Peter,
[377.42 → 379.12] this didn't come from your own brilliance,
[379.12 → 381.60] but this was revealed to you by God himself.
[382.82 → 383.96] And Jesus goes on,
[383.96 → 385.28] and he says this line,
[385.80 → 388.94] on this I shall build my ecclesial,
[389.22 → 391.22] first time the word is used in the gospel,
[391.54 → 392.42] my church.
[392.68 → 394.64] On this I will build my church,
[394.98 → 396.24] and the gates of hell,
[396.30 → 396.90] there we are again,
[397.12 → 400.10] and the gates of hell shall not overcome it.
[401.28 → 403.52] A community founded on Jesus' identity
[403.52 → 404.28] as the Messiah,
[404.48 → 405.40] the son of the living God.
[408.74 → 411.10] I was reading this quote from a guy named Drew Dyson,
[412.10 → 413.34] and he says it this way,
[413.96 → 414.94] he says,
[414.94 → 416.84] in Matthew's gospel,
[417.64 → 420.66] the disciples have already identified Jesus as Messiah
[420.66 → 422.38] prior to where we read today,
[422.74 → 424.64] thereby limiting the drama of Peter's confession.
[425.14 → 426.78] The turning point in the story,
[426.92 → 427.72] according to Dyson,
[428.28 → 430.94] is rather that Jesus would build his church
[430.94 → 434.12] on a cracked foundation of a flawed disciple,
[434.28 → 435.52] and we could even say disciples.
[436.44 → 438.10] What a powerful witness to the church
[438.10 → 440.06] that could open up a powerful moment
[440.06 → 441.62] in a congregation's life.
[441.62 → 442.28] This is for us.
[442.28 → 445.36] The story doesn't simply end triumphantly, however,
[445.60 → 447.20] but with a charge for the church
[447.20 → 448.88] to live according to this new kingdom.
[449.24 → 451.92] The church is not simply to stand in victory,
[452.26 → 454.72] but is given the power to bind and loose,
[454.76 → 455.82] we'll talk a bit more about that,
[456.10 → 458.04] perhaps unleashing the power of forgiveness
[458.04 → 459.42] and grace in the world,
[459.42 → 462.12] or heralding the prophetic role of the church
[462.12 → 463.90] in fighting oppression and evil.
[465.16 → 466.46] And so, in Matthew,
[466.60 → 468.36] we see that the church is rooted
[468.36 → 471.34] in this confession of Jesus as Messiah
[471.34 → 472.50] and Son of God.
[472.84 → 476.52] We see the church set in the context of conflict
[476.52 → 479.54] with opposing views right up front there.
[479.78 → 481.34] We don't see a church here
[481.34 → 484.60] that is about escaping the big bad world.
[484.60 → 486.28] We see the church as something
[486.28 → 489.24] that steps into the midst of it all
[489.24 → 492.14] with the power of Jesus as Messiah.
[492.40 → 493.82] We see the church entrusted
[493.82 → 495.16] with the keys of the kingdom.
[495.58 → 497.36] That's all about God's reign.
[497.62 → 499.82] That's about how the reign overcomes sin
[499.82 → 501.96] and overcomes death and brings life,
[502.16 → 504.18] a reign that brings life in Christ.
[505.74 → 506.92] Let me give you another quote.
[507.48 → 509.00] This is one from a guy named Eugene Boring.
[510.14 → 510.60] And he said,
[510.74 → 512.42] and he was addressing it to pastors,
[512.52 → 513.02] so you'll see here,
[513.02 → 515.30] teaching and preaching from this text
[515.30 → 516.96] should point to the church
[516.96 → 518.72] not as a human achievement
[518.72 → 521.52] or a fellowship of like-minded individuals
[521.52 → 522.84] who have formed a support group,
[523.24 → 525.88] but to God as the one who through Christ
[525.88 → 528.74] grants the revelation that generates faith,
[529.16 → 531.70] the one who blesses those who receive the revelation
[531.70 → 533.00] that Jesus is the Messiah,
[533.30 → 535.26] and the one who gives us a new name,
[535.40 → 536.22] identity, nature,
[536.46 → 537.40] not just a label.
[537.40 → 539.52] The Christian word is not a label.
[539.72 → 540.40] It's an identity
[540.40 → 542.78] and sends us to continue his work
[542.78 → 545.16] including the authority to make decisions
[545.16 → 546.70] in his name.
[547.48 → 548.94] And you see how powerful this is
[548.94 → 550.52] really about a description
[550.52 → 551.90] of the church,
[552.14 → 553.22] of who we are.
[554.22 → 555.62] Notice Jesus says to Simon,
[556.14 → 557.12] you are Peter,
[557.68 → 558.40] rock,
[559.14 → 560.82] and I'll build my church on you
[560.82 → 562.40] and others who confess
[562.40 → 563.90] like you have.
[565.06 → 566.28] I'm not going to get into the whole
[566.28 → 567.08] papal thing,
[567.22 → 569.14] which Roman Catholics tend to do.
[569.14 → 571.52] We don't go down that path the same way.
[571.80 → 574.70] But Peter is certainly a leader,
[574.84 → 575.84] an important leader.
[576.52 → 578.24] And Jesus does call him rock,
[578.48 → 581.26] but he's calling this confession rock solid.
[583.06 → 585.06] Peter, shortly after this,
[585.14 → 586.64] because if we're looking just at Peter,
[587.18 → 587.92] shortly after this,
[587.92 → 589.00] that's why that last verse
[589.00 → 589.80] where I,
[590.22 → 591.48] out of Matthew,
[591.48 → 592.86] he says,
[592.96 → 593.86] from then on,
[593.92 → 595.10] he went and was showing them
[595.10 → 596.64] that he must go to Jerusalem
[596.64 → 598.42] and must eventually die
[598.42 → 599.26] and rise again.
[600.00 → 601.30] I included that
[601.30 → 603.26] because right after that,
[603.34 → 603.90] after Jesus said,
[604.00 → 604.90] I'm going to Jerusalem,
[604.98 → 605.40] I'm going to die,
[605.80 → 606.70] Peter says,
[606.86 → 609.00] no way,
[609.14 → 610.56] you can't do that.
[611.42 → 612.62] And then Jesus says to him,
[613.12 → 613.86] because he's saying,
[613.94 → 614.60] don't do the mission,
[615.02 → 615.82] Jesus says to him,
[616.14 → 617.32] get thee behind me, Satan.
[617.56 → 618.26] What you're saying
[618.26 → 620.00] is contrary to what I'm trying to do.
[621.46 → 622.18] The same Peter
[622.18 → 624.20] who denies Jesus three times.
[624.88 → 627.74] So Peter isn't really the point.
[631.78 → 632.58] And Peter's,
[633.16 → 633.72] and us,
[634.26 → 637.22] Jesus hands the keys of the kingdom to us.
[637.22 → 637.38] You know,
[637.48 → 638.78] I had a hard enough time
[638.78 → 640.88] handing keys to teenagers
[640.88 → 642.98] when they learned to drive.
[643.12 → 644.58] Jesus is saying to the church,
[644.72 → 644.82] wow,
[645.10 → 646.68] here are the keys to the kingdom
[646.68 → 648.90] that the truth of the gospel
[648.90 → 650.76] is in your hands.
[651.40 → 653.12] And I love how Paul describes it
[653.12 → 655.48] in 2 Corinthians 4, 7,
[656.18 → 657.48] where Paul writes this,
[657.96 → 659.26] but we have this treasure,
[659.46 → 660.70] this gift of the gospel,
[661.14 → 662.36] this treasure of faith
[662.36 → 664.28] in jars of clay.
[665.72 → 667.22] In jars of clay.
[667.40 → 667.90] That's us.
[668.02 → 669.04] We're jars of clay.
[669.14 → 670.10] We crack easily.
[670.42 → 672.08] Yet we're called rocks.
[673.24 → 673.96] Okay, together.
[673.96 → 675.44] jars of clay
[675.44 → 676.68] to show that this
[676.68 → 677.72] all-surpassing power
[677.72 → 678.90] is from God
[678.90 → 681.46] and not us.
[684.14 → 685.52] So Peter's named Rock.
[686.54 → 687.28] One scholar,
[687.48 → 688.58] I don't really know
[688.58 → 689.62] if it's 100% true or not.
[689.96 → 690.78] I'd have to think
[690.78 → 691.44] a little hard on it.
[691.68 → 692.56] But I like what he said.
[692.68 → 693.00] In a way,
[693.06 → 693.68] he said this was,
[694.40 → 695.30] when he called Peter
[695.30 → 695.98] Rock,
[696.06 → 697.34] he used the word Petrol,
[697.88 → 698.52] which kind of,
[698.78 → 699.40] according to this one scholar,
[699.48 → 700.26] means little rock.
[700.26 → 703.26] And then he called himself Petra,
[703.40 → 704.00] which means rock,
[704.08 → 705.46] which means big, solid rock.
[706.66 → 707.76] I like the picture
[707.76 → 709.34] of this little rock
[709.34 → 710.26] being built
[710.26 → 711.32] on the foundation
[711.32 → 712.88] of the solid rock of Jesus,
[713.00 → 713.32] because I think
[713.32 → 714.16] that's what's going on here.
[715.42 → 716.92] But these are flawed,
[717.32 → 718.86] cracked rocks that we are,
[719.82 → 721.36] who confess Jesus
[721.36 → 722.52] is the true foundation.
[723.06 → 723.48] Even though,
[723.62 → 724.04] like Peter,
[724.26 → 725.92] we don't fully comprehend that.
[725.98 → 726.12] I mean,
[726.16 → 727.58] Peter doesn't really know
[727.58 → 728.62] 100% what he's saying
[728.62 → 728.88] when he says,
[728.88 → 729.56] you are the Christ,
[729.82 → 730.44] you are the Messiah,
[730.66 → 731.30] Son of the living God.
[731.44 → 733.46] He doesn't get all that.
[735.30 → 736.54] He doesn't comprehend all that.
[736.54 → 737.52] That's why Jesus said,
[737.62 → 738.60] it's a revelation
[738.60 → 739.28] that you got
[739.28 → 740.24] that you're going to have
[740.24 → 741.82] to unpack for a long time.
[742.20 → 743.52] He doesn't get it completely
[743.52 → 745.20] until after the resurrection,
[745.58 → 746.10] after the coming
[746.10 → 746.76] of the Holy Spirit.
[747.08 → 747.80] Then there's much
[747.80 → 748.72] greater understanding.
[749.16 → 749.66] And that's why,
[749.78 → 749.96] you know,
[750.00 → 751.30] soon after this,
[751.36 → 752.46] he tries to stop Jesus
[752.46 → 753.30] from going to the cross.
[753.72 → 754.94] He denied Jesus three times.
[755.28 → 755.38] Right?
[755.64 → 756.76] There's the rock.
[757.90 → 758.34] Flawed.
[758.34 → 758.86] Broken.
[759.96 → 760.58] A clay pot.
[762.58 → 762.98] And yet,
[763.10 → 764.48] Jesus hands over the keys,
[764.98 → 766.38] the authority to the church.
[767.90 → 768.70] Ephesians 2,
[768.80 → 769.58] it says this way,
[770.30 → 771.28] 19 and 20.
[771.72 → 772.22] Paul writes,
[772.30 → 772.88] consequently,
[773.42 → 774.36] he's talking to Gentiles,
[774.44 → 775.36] you're no longer foreigners
[775.36 → 775.94] and strangers,
[776.28 → 777.20] but fellow citizens
[777.20 → 778.06] with God's people,
[778.44 → 779.60] members of his household,
[779.74 → 780.14] the church,
[780.62 → 782.78] built on the foundation
[782.78 → 784.34] of the apostles
[784.34 → 785.14] and the prophets
[785.14 → 786.70] with Christ himself
[786.70 → 788.64] as chief cornerstone,
[788.92 → 790.56] as the rock
[790.56 → 792.32] that holds it all together.
[793.84 → 795.00] That's what's happening here.
[795.84 → 798.18] If you recognize Jesus
[798.18 → 798.88] as Messiah,
[799.06 → 799.88] son of the living God,
[800.20 → 800.74] Jesus says,
[801.24 → 802.10] as he said to Peter,
[802.34 → 803.78] you are blessed.
[803.78 → 806.16] We are Peter
[806.16 → 807.22] when we confess that.
[807.54 → 808.66] We are rocks too.
[811.06 → 811.84] You should go to look
[811.84 → 813.28] at the person next to you
[813.28 → 813.58] and say,
[813.66 → 814.16] you rock,
[814.24 → 814.48] but anyway,
[814.56 → 815.54] I don't want to do that.
[816.28 → 817.08] We are rocks,
[817.12 → 817.98] maybe little rocks,
[818.44 → 819.30] but we are built
[819.30 → 819.94] on the foundation,
[820.06 → 820.44] the cornerstone
[820.44 → 821.20] of Jesus Christ.
[821.20 → 821.28] Christ.
[822.48 → 823.78] We participate
[823.78 → 825.16] in kingdom bringing
[825.16 → 826.06] and kingdom living.
[826.44 → 827.56] We are given authority
[827.56 → 828.24] as church,
[828.62 → 830.36] authority that is described here
[830.36 → 832.10] as binding and loosing,
[832.64 → 834.20] which is kind of a Jewish term
[834.20 → 836.20] for what the leaders did
[836.20 → 836.84] with the law.
[837.34 → 838.54] They would bind certain things,
[838.64 → 839.90] make it important
[839.90 → 841.72] to keep those things contained
[841.72 → 842.78] and loose things.
[842.94 → 844.02] You don't have to do that
[844.02 → 845.36] and you're free to do that
[845.36 → 847.72] to try to protect the law.
[847.72 → 851.68] The problem is that
[851.68 → 853.60] it got out of hand
[853.60 → 857.90] and it was misused
[857.90 → 858.92] and we'll talk a little bit more
[858.92 → 859.68] about that too,
[859.80 → 861.70] but this binding and loosing
[861.70 → 862.26] is important,
[862.42 → 863.42] but it's also about
[863.42 → 864.18] to forgive.
[865.26 → 865.98] It's also about
[865.98 → 867.38] holding one another accountable.
[867.62 → 868.34] That's part of this
[868.34 → 869.34] binding and loosing
[869.34 → 870.78] and we do this
[870.78 → 872.52] building our lives on Jesus
[872.52 → 873.68] who is our cornerstone,
[874.32 → 875.44] living by the word,
[875.76 → 877.02] living by the truth of scripture.
[877.02 → 878.92] We're not making this stuff up.
[879.08 → 880.24] We're wrestling with it
[880.24 → 881.08] through the power
[881.08 → 881.90] of the Holy Spirit
[881.90 → 883.84] and we wrestle together.
[884.24 → 885.08] That's what it means
[885.08 → 886.00] to be a community
[886.00 → 887.84] and we don't just
[887.84 → 888.78] shoot off our mouths
[888.78 → 889.80] and give our own opinions.
[890.00 → 890.68] We're trying to go
[890.68 → 892.34] much, much deeper than that.
[892.74 → 894.24] So yes, Jesus asked
[894.24 → 895.50] all of us,
[895.86 → 898.06] who do you say I am?
[901.04 → 903.66] Am I one option among many
[903.66 → 906.38] or am I your Messiah?
[907.02 → 910.60] And then,
[910.94 → 912.32] do our confessions
[912.32 → 914.72] translate into the way we live?
[915.30 → 916.14] Because let's face it,
[916.22 → 917.24] talk is cheap.
[918.10 → 919.42] The Gospels are not just
[919.42 → 920.64] interested in correctly
[920.64 → 921.68] defining Jesus,
[921.96 → 922.88] but also in shaping
[922.88 → 923.58] a community
[923.58 → 924.62] who live out
[924.62 → 925.72] those confessions.
[927.16 → 928.20] These questions
[928.20 → 929.48] are not just about definition,
[929.92 → 930.92] but a formation
[930.92 → 932.30] of living out
[932.30 → 933.76] the way of Jesus.
[933.76 → 936.08] are the words
[936.08 → 936.94] we confess,
[937.68 → 939.24] are they being
[939.24 → 940.86] displayed in the way
[940.86 → 942.34] we live?
[944.26 → 945.60] You should ask yourself
[945.60 → 946.48] that question too.
[948.54 → 949.64] Jesus is saying,
[950.06 → 951.92] who you say I am
[951.92 → 954.82] determines how you live.
[954.82 → 959.00] that's why it's so problematic
[959.00 → 960.44] when Christians say things
[960.44 → 960.64] like,
[960.72 → 961.96] oh, I believe in Jesus,
[962.36 → 964.12] and then they're the biggest
[964.12 → 964.82] jerks around.
[967.70 → 969.56] It works totally contrary
[969.56 → 970.42] to the confession.
[970.42 → 975.04] when we confess Jesus,
[975.16 → 975.76] we ought to be
[975.76 → 977.12] the most loving people around,
[977.42 → 979.24] still speaking the truth.
[983.42 → 984.82] Who do you say I am?
[986.50 → 987.56] I have this binding
[987.56 → 988.24] and loosing.
[989.02 → 989.52] And then,
[989.86 → 990.88] let me re-read
[990.88 → 991.80] verse 19 to you.
[992.06 → 993.28] I will give you the keys,
[993.40 → 994.30] whatever you bind on earth
[994.30 → 994.96] will be bound in heaven,
[995.02 → 995.86] and whatever you loose on earth
[995.86 → 996.86] will be loosed in heaven.
[997.18 → 998.04] And we have this sort of,
[998.24 → 998.88] it made me think of
[998.88 → 999.88] the Lord's Prayer,
[1000.30 → 1000.48] you know,
[1000.68 → 1001.92] may it be on earth
[1001.92 → 1002.72] as it is in heaven.
[1002.80 → 1003.68] Now it almost feels like
[1003.68 → 1004.48] it's doing the opposite.
[1004.80 → 1005.78] But it's talking about
[1005.78 → 1006.48] this synergy,
[1006.66 → 1007.40] this connection
[1007.40 → 1009.30] between heaven and earth.
[1010.02 → 1010.92] Heaven has kind of
[1010.92 → 1012.46] come down through Jesus.
[1013.28 → 1014.56] That's what we're doing here.
[1014.98 → 1017.76] The church is seen in action
[1017.76 → 1018.90] where freedom
[1018.90 → 1020.64] is expressed in Christ.
[1021.42 → 1022.76] Things are loosed.
[1023.20 → 1024.16] We are loosed.
[1024.84 → 1025.58] We are free
[1025.58 → 1027.12] to serve Jesus,
[1027.46 → 1028.58] to have our sins forgiven.
[1028.88 → 1030.20] That loosens us,
[1030.26 → 1031.30] that frees us.
[1031.58 → 1032.66] But we are also under
[1032.66 → 1034.46] the authority of Scripture.
[1034.76 → 1035.74] So some things are bound.
[1036.00 → 1036.92] We don't just live
[1036.92 → 1038.68] any way we feel like it.
[1042.10 → 1042.96] Why do you do
[1042.96 → 1044.32] this or this?
[1044.76 → 1045.68] Well, that's what Scripture says.
[1046.84 → 1047.56] Yeah, but, you know,
[1047.60 → 1048.06] that's not the way
[1048.06 → 1049.04] you do things in the world today.
[1049.20 → 1049.88] No, it doesn't matter.
[1051.14 → 1052.16] This is what Scripture says.
[1052.22 → 1053.24] This is what the Holy Spirit
[1053.24 → 1053.84] leads me to do.
[1053.92 → 1054.50] This is what the Holy Spirit
[1054.50 → 1055.18] leads us to do.
[1055.34 → 1056.54] We do this together.
[1056.54 → 1058.82] It shows up in the way we live.
[1059.22 → 1060.94] Actions speak louder than words.
[1061.82 → 1062.68] And I have to confess,
[1062.78 → 1063.60] and I'm sure you do too,
[1064.34 → 1067.06] my actions and my confessions
[1067.06 → 1069.80] don't always align very well.
[1070.98 → 1071.64] You ever have that?
[1073.24 → 1073.98] You say, wow, wow,
[1074.08 → 1074.24] you know,
[1074.30 → 1075.88] I use the name of Jesus
[1075.88 → 1076.76] and I live sometimes
[1076.76 → 1078.42] in ways very contrary to that.
[1080.58 → 1081.94] Very contrary to that.
[1081.94 → 1083.26] So, yes,
[1083.44 → 1085.68] let's confess Jesus is Lord
[1085.68 → 1087.34] and then let's live out of that
[1087.34 → 1088.44] within our relationships.
[1090.84 → 1091.78] How's that going for you?
[1093.96 → 1095.14] Jesus is my Messiah.
[1095.28 → 1096.04] How's that showing up
[1096.04 → 1096.52] in your marriage,
[1096.58 → 1097.14] in your friendships?
[1098.80 → 1099.94] The way you treat your kids.
[1100.88 → 1101.74] Jesus is Lord.
[1102.00 → 1102.74] How's that going
[1102.74 → 1103.54] with your bank account?
[1104.18 → 1105.38] Jesus is Lord and Messiah.
[1105.62 → 1106.18] How's that going
[1106.18 → 1107.36] with the use of your daily time?
[1107.64 → 1108.58] Jesus is Lord and Messiah.
[1108.68 → 1109.46] How's that going
[1109.46 → 1111.10] with how you start your day
[1111.10 → 1111.80] and live your day
[1111.80 → 1112.46] and make decisions?
[1115.26 → 1117.04] It shows up in how you live.
[1118.02 → 1119.10] Let's keep looking
[1119.10 → 1120.46] for misalignment
[1120.46 → 1121.70] between what we say
[1121.70 → 1122.58] and what we do.
[1122.84 → 1125.20] That's a huge piece of life
[1125.20 → 1126.88] where I'm misaligned here.
[1126.94 → 1128.12] I say this and I do this.
[1128.26 → 1129.66] I've got to bring these two together
[1129.66 → 1130.18] more and more
[1130.18 → 1131.40] through the power of God's Spirit
[1131.40 → 1132.84] and through the truth of His Word.
[1134.04 → 1135.10] Does all of what I do
[1135.10 → 1136.90] reflect what I say about Jesus?
[1137.74 → 1138.68] Am I willing to be
[1138.68 → 1140.24] continually transformed,
[1140.62 → 1141.94] continually changed,
[1143.32 → 1146.38] resting in the knowledge
[1146.38 → 1147.74] that Jesus is our rock
[1147.74 → 1148.96] and in Him, we are victorious.
[1150.02 → 1151.98] And then we can rest in this too
[1151.98 → 1153.84] and not even the gates of hell
[1153.84 → 1154.58] can prevail.
[1156.22 → 1158.86] Hell itself cannot change
[1158.86 → 1161.96] the trajectory Jesus has you on.
[1164.84 → 1165.58] So yes,
[1166.38 → 1167.44] we are given authority.
[1167.44 → 1168.70] Keys of the kingdom.
[1169.00 → 1171.48] But the point isn't Peter's authority
[1171.48 → 1172.16] or our authority.
[1172.44 → 1173.80] The point is that the gates of hell
[1173.80 → 1174.42] will not prevail
[1174.42 → 1176.04] because Jesus is our rock.
[1178.20 → 1179.32] Picture that scene again,
[1179.38 → 1180.12] that opening scene.
[1180.24 → 1181.26] There we stand
[1181.26 → 1184.46] at the entrance of the cave
[1184.46 → 1186.24] of other options,
[1187.30 → 1190.04] of lies about where authority lies.
[1192.18 → 1193.20] Lies that tell,
[1193.50 → 1195.02] authority is over here,
[1195.26 → 1196.04] authority is over here.
[1196.04 → 1197.86] No, authority rests with you.
[1198.06 → 1199.72] You can do whatever you feel like it.
[1199.88 → 1201.36] Don't let anybody tell you what to do.
[1201.66 → 1202.50] You do you.
[1202.62 → 1203.48] That's your truth.
[1203.68 → 1204.62] And we hear all these lies.
[1207.70 → 1208.88] And there we stand
[1208.88 → 1209.74] with Jesus,
[1210.48 → 1212.36] our true source of life
[1212.36 → 1213.20] and strength
[1213.20 → 1214.24] and truth.
[1215.24 → 1216.38] Jesus, our Messiah.
[1217.40 → 1219.12] Jesus, the Son of God.
[1219.54 → 1220.60] He is our unity,
[1220.98 → 1221.98] our source of authority,
[1222.38 → 1224.16] the one who we build our lives on.
[1224.16 → 1225.70] And the job of the church
[1225.70 → 1227.06] is to confess him
[1227.06 → 1229.64] and to live like him.
[1231.88 → 1234.64] Too often, we want Jesus plus.
[1236.10 → 1238.18] We want Jesus on our side.
[1238.28 → 1240.58] We want Jesus to look a lot more like us
[1240.58 → 1241.52] instead of us like him.
[1241.74 → 1244.18] We want Jesus to fit into the world around us.
[1244.66 → 1246.16] We want him to be palatable.
[1246.16 → 1251.26] And yet, we confess.
[1252.60 → 1253.38] With Peter,
[1253.78 → 1255.38] Jesus is Messiah.
[1255.76 → 1257.04] Jesus is the Son of God.
[1257.82 → 1259.32] Jesus is the one we're waiting for.
[1259.64 → 1260.98] Jesus is the one who reigns.
[1261.24 → 1262.30] Jesus is the rock,
[1262.54 → 1263.14] the cornerstone,
[1263.32 → 1264.56] the foundation of it all.
[1266.16 → 1266.66] And Peter,
[1267.04 → 1268.02] Peter and us,
[1268.28 → 1270.32] we might not always comprehend fully
[1270.32 → 1271.04] what that means
[1271.04 → 1271.98] when we confess that.
[1271.98 → 1274.00] And I think we're all working on that.
[1274.10 → 1275.12] We'll probably work on that
[1275.12 → 1276.74] for the rest of our lives.
[1277.90 → 1279.54] We'll learn what it means
[1279.54 → 1281.50] to live out our confession.
[1281.86 → 1283.36] That's what we're doing.
[1284.74 → 1286.28] And we'll do this in community
[1286.28 → 1287.38] as Christ's church.
[1288.04 → 1289.64] Because we can't do it alone.
[1291.18 → 1291.50] And yeah,
[1291.60 → 1292.62] there will be times we struggle.
[1292.84 → 1294.04] We struggle to understand it all.
[1294.30 → 1296.24] And then we'll bind, and we'll lose
[1296.24 → 1298.22] and we'll join God's work of redemption.
[1298.22 → 1301.96] If Jesus is the Messiah,
[1302.06 → 1302.74] and we believe he is,
[1303.02 → 1305.32] the one who inaugurates the realm of God,
[1305.72 → 1307.16] then it would seem that those
[1307.16 → 1308.30] who accept the mission
[1308.30 → 1309.92] to become part of that team
[1309.92 → 1311.72] that helps bring that realm,
[1311.84 → 1312.62] the kingdom of God,
[1312.94 → 1315.86] into existence more and more and more.
[1318.02 → 1319.54] We have a choice as a church,
[1320.38 → 1320.92] as a people.
[1321.40 → 1323.98] We can participate in God's work
[1323.98 → 1325.52] of loosening the creation
[1325.52 → 1326.54] from its bondage.
[1326.54 → 1328.66] Whatever that bondage looks like,
[1329.24 → 1331.20] by bringing the message
[1331.20 → 1333.18] of forgiveness and reconciliation,
[1334.38 → 1336.76] or we can ignore the mission completely
[1336.76 → 1338.64] and just look out for ourselves
[1338.64 → 1339.88] and hunker down.
[1342.40 → 1343.80] That's not the one I want.
[1346.58 → 1348.50] And then the question remains,
[1348.98 → 1351.04] if we're going to go on this mission,
[1351.24 → 1352.88] if we're going to go to the gates of hell itself,
[1353.10 → 1354.32] what would it look like
[1354.32 → 1355.92] for us as Hope Community Church
[1355.92 → 1357.64] to live out of our confessions
[1357.64 → 1359.16] more and more this year?
[1360.80 → 1363.12] What if we too would see ourselves
[1363.12 → 1364.24] as rocks?
[1364.50 → 1365.32] We're rocks.
[1365.44 → 1366.22] Jesus said so.
[1366.46 → 1368.06] Built on the foundation of Jesus.
[1369.26 → 1371.00] We're part of the structure.
[1372.36 → 1373.54] How will that change
[1373.54 → 1374.62] the way we get up in the morning?
[1376.22 → 1377.72] Every morning, get up and,
[1378.86 → 1379.92] I am a rock!
[1379.92 → 1383.38] versus, I need to hide somewhere.
[1387.00 → 1388.58] What will that mean to us
[1388.58 → 1389.58] as we are the church?
[1390.64 → 1391.78] So there we are.
[1392.46 → 1393.26] You're there too.
[1394.18 → 1395.18] Standing with Jesus
[1395.18 → 1396.48] before the gates of hell,
[1396.62 → 1398.42] before all that's wrong,
[1399.02 → 1400.12] before all that proclaims,
[1400.96 → 1402.56] we don't need a Messiah.
[1402.56 → 1404.28] And we are asked again,
[1404.50 → 1407.00] who do you say I am?
[1413.08 → 1413.98] There's this book
[1413.98 → 1414.96] that I read called
[1414.96 → 1415.86] Organic Church
[1415.86 → 1417.74] by a guy named Neil Cole.
[1418.78 → 1420.08] He had an interesting insight
[1420.08 → 1421.16] about this passage.
[1422.40 → 1423.12] He says this.
[1423.34 → 1423.54] He says,
[1423.82 → 1425.30] Jesus said that the gates of hell
[1425.30 → 1425.96] won't prevail
[1425.96 → 1427.04] against this church
[1427.04 → 1428.00] built on the rock.
[1429.26 → 1430.32] There's this cave,
[1430.32 → 1431.08] and as he's saying that,
[1431.14 → 1431.86] there's this cave
[1431.86 → 1433.58] looming over Jesus' shoulder
[1433.58 → 1434.46] as he talks to us.
[1435.38 → 1436.06] And Cole says,
[1436.38 → 1436.70] gates,
[1436.92 → 1437.54] or reminds us that
[1437.54 → 1438.22] gates are used
[1438.22 → 1439.26] in military strategy.
[1439.68 → 1441.04] But gates are not
[1441.04 → 1442.32] offensive weapons.
[1443.06 → 1443.68] Think about that.
[1444.44 → 1445.42] No one ever won a battle
[1445.42 → 1446.06] by breaking out
[1446.06 → 1446.76] of a great gate.
[1447.28 → 1449.30] Gates are defensive in nature.
[1450.32 → 1451.58] They're there to block something.
[1452.40 → 1453.50] So when Jesus talks
[1453.50 → 1454.10] about his church
[1454.10 → 1456.24] struggling with the forces
[1456.24 → 1456.92] of evil,
[1457.52 → 1458.44] Jesus assumes
[1458.44 → 1459.20] the church
[1459.20 → 1460.84] is on the offensive.
[1464.10 → 1465.06] There's the gate,
[1465.62 → 1466.86] and we're storming it.
[1468.94 → 1470.10] We're on the attack.
[1471.16 → 1472.48] And hell is counting
[1472.48 → 1473.42] on its gate
[1473.42 → 1475.30] as a defensive position.
[1476.48 → 1479.02] We are on the attack
[1479.02 → 1479.96] in a war
[1479.96 → 1482.28] that Jesus has already won.
[1483.78 → 1485.54] We ought not to be
[1485.54 → 1486.68] cowering in a corner.
[1486.68 → 1488.26] We ought to be bold
[1488.26 → 1489.40] in our attack
[1489.40 → 1490.36] against things
[1490.36 → 1491.08] that are wrong,
[1491.36 → 1492.10] against evil
[1492.10 → 1492.74] and ourselves
[1492.74 → 1493.98] and the world around us
[1493.98 → 1494.94] because Jesus
[1494.94 → 1495.72] has overcome.
[1497.08 → 1498.70] We are on the move.
[1500.32 → 1502.30] And the forces of evil
[1502.30 → 1503.82] should be trembling
[1503.82 → 1504.96] as we approach.
[1504.96 → 1509.38] because when evil
[1509.38 → 1510.02] is dark,
[1510.82 → 1511.92] we bring light.
[1513.20 → 1514.84] When evil brings despair,
[1515.12 → 1515.82] we bring hope.
[1516.60 → 1517.18] When evil
[1517.18 → 1518.20] collars behind
[1518.20 → 1519.42] the gates of death,
[1519.74 → 1520.82] we tear those gates
[1520.82 → 1521.60] down with the
[1521.60 → 1522.52] resurrection power
[1522.52 → 1523.12] of Jesus,
[1523.50 → 1524.06] our Messiah.
[1526.06 → 1526.70] Because,
[1526.90 → 1527.76] as John said
[1527.76 → 1528.50] in his gospel,
[1528.98 → 1529.68] the light
[1529.68 → 1530.46] shines
[1530.46 → 1531.50] in the darkness
[1531.50 → 1533.34] and the darkness
[1533.34 → 1534.44] does not
[1534.44 → 1535.08] overcome.
[1536.40 → 1537.20] Let's pray.
[1541.96 → 1542.88] Father God,
[1542.98 → 1544.26] we are so grateful
[1544.26 → 1545.76] that you
[1545.76 → 1547.50] are our foundation,
[1547.70 → 1548.18] that you
[1548.18 → 1549.46] are our cornerstone,
[1549.68 → 1550.38] that you
[1550.38 → 1551.20] have overcome
[1551.20 → 1552.92] and we get to
[1552.92 → 1553.94] confess you
[1553.94 → 1555.06] and then live
[1555.06 → 1556.00] out of that confession.
[1556.16 → 1556.24] Lord,
[1556.28 → 1557.24] help us to do so.
[1557.94 → 1558.72] Help us to
[1558.72 → 1562.60] speak our hearts
[1562.60 → 1563.46] confessions
[1563.46 → 1564.38] and then to
[1564.38 → 1565.14] live life
[1565.14 → 1565.82] each day
[1565.82 → 1566.70] with the knowledge
[1566.70 → 1567.12] that you
[1567.12 → 1567.78] are our Messiah.
[1569.12 → 1570.04] And in you
[1570.04 → 1571.46] we are rocks.
[1572.10 → 1572.62] In you
[1572.62 → 1573.28] we are built
[1573.28 → 1574.32] on a solid foundation.
[1575.08 → 1575.82] And we can
[1575.82 → 1576.60] then step
[1576.60 → 1577.40] into the midst
[1577.40 → 1577.94] of evil
[1577.94 → 1579.02] knowing
[1579.02 → 1579.56] that you
[1579.56 → 1580.02] have overcome.
[1580.94 → 1581.88] And we praise you
[1581.88 → 1582.34] for that
[1582.34 → 1583.12] and we ask
[1583.12 → 1584.62] that we may
[1584.62 → 1585.10] bring honour
[1585.10 → 1585.54] and glory
[1585.54 → 1586.32] to your great
[1586.32 → 1587.16] and holy name.
[1587.76 → 1587.98] Amen.
[1588.72 → 1589.72] Amen.
