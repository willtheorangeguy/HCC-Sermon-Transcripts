[0.00 --> 8.02]  well good morning everyone
[8.02 --> 16.44]  you sounded quiet today good morning it's good to be in worship together i know a few of us are
[16.44 --> 20.98]  missing for the long weekend but we're allowed to be happy to be here too as pastor said mentioned
[20.98 --> 25.48]  we're starting a new sermon series and we're entitling the series come holy spirit it's
[25.48 --> 29.14]  pentecost sunday and so for the next number of weeks we are looking at the person and the work
[29.14 --> 33.74]  of the holy spirit we're going to be looking at the way in which god's spirit was poured out on
[33.74 --> 37.92]  pentecost this morning we're going to be looking at the ministry of jesus himself and how he was
[37.92 --> 42.72]  filled and empowered to do what he did by the spirit we're going to look at spiritual gifts
[42.72 --> 50.10]  spiritual fruit and our hope in all of this series is for us to grow in our expectation of what is
[50.10 --> 56.76]  possible through the holy spirit i should highlight that we have lined up this sermon series with two
[56.76 --> 60.34]  things one is the worship night pastor said mentioned that's happening next sunday we invite
[60.34 --> 65.30]  you to that but secondly we're going to be doing in two weeks time a spiritual gift seminar for us to
[65.30 --> 70.26]  begin the work of discerning like how has god wired me to serve what are the gifts that he has given me
[70.26 --> 74.62]  for the sake of his body and for his world and we invite you to both of those things that we've lined
[74.62 --> 82.48]  up with this series i'm going to read the story of pentecost in acts one acts two actually and uh
[82.48 --> 87.94]  you can read along in your bible or on the screen but i also want to say this is one of those passages
[87.94 --> 93.80]  that's just worth imagining and kids if you've got your sermon notes you can also try drawing this
[93.80 --> 99.86]  passage because i just think this is such a beautiful image of what god did on pentecost sunday so here we go
[99.86 --> 109.52]  when the day of pentecost came they were all together in one place suddenly a sound like the blowing of a
[109.52 --> 117.42]  violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting they saw what seemed
[117.42 --> 125.76]  to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them all of them were filled with
[125.76 --> 133.52]  the holy spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit enabled them this is god's word
[133.52 --> 139.68]  now i've mentioned before here at hope that i did not grow up in a church that emphasized
[139.68 --> 145.86]  or taught a lot about the work of the holy spirit it was sort of one of those not unimportant but it's
[145.86 --> 151.66]  background not the foreground and i think part of that was um that we grew up not that far away from
[151.66 --> 156.78]  toronto uh airport blessings church when i say that does that resonate with anybody here a few people
[156.78 --> 161.34]  okay and so i remember growing up in a family in a household where there like some strains going on
[161.34 --> 167.08]  there like gold dust gold stuff and uh that sort of instilled within me at a young age like what is
[167.08 --> 174.18]  this charismatic stuff uh and yet at many points in my life there were experiences that i've had and
[174.18 --> 179.78]  i'm sure many of us can relate to this where the spirit of god just showed up unexpectedly and i had to
[179.78 --> 186.36]  wrestle with who is this holy spirit and what does it mean to live life in the spirit and i'll just share
[186.36 --> 191.64]  one very memorable experience that i've had and uh maybe i'll share another story at the end of
[191.64 --> 197.22]  something that i'll share with me later but in uni or sorry at regent college my third year in we were
[197.22 --> 201.82]  required to go on a prayer retreat and i say required because i wouldn't have gone if i wasn't
[201.82 --> 208.18]  required because it was a busy season of life and we went down to washington to a small church uh and
[208.18 --> 212.86]  in the inner city there and they taught on prayer and then at the end of the evening session the first day
[212.86 --> 217.34]  uh they said to all the students there like you can stick around and receive prayer if you'd like
[217.34 --> 221.80]  they had intercessors gifted prayers in their church and at that time in my life i was tired i
[221.80 --> 227.00]  was working full-time in school we had two kids at the time i was like i would love to receive prayer
[227.00 --> 232.48]  so i stuck around i didn't know i was getting myself into and then a fellow came up to me uh and he said
[232.48 --> 237.34]  to me is it okay if i place my hand on your chest i'm like that's a bit weird uh but he did i was okay
[237.34 --> 241.54]  with that and then he just started praying quietly murmurs i didn't know what he was saying
[241.54 --> 246.04]  then he stopped and he said to me would it be okay with you if i shared what i think god is saying
[246.04 --> 251.86]  to you and he proceeded to give me an image and share with me some very profound things that only
[251.86 --> 259.86]  god would know about me and where i'm at in life and it was so profound it was like um after i got
[259.86 --> 265.96]  beyond the weirdness of it it was like you know hair on your arm raising the presence of god is there
[265.96 --> 269.92]  and after that time of prayer and lots of other students have the same experience we're just kind
[269.92 --> 274.80]  of walking back to where we were staying nearby that church and i just found myself wondering
[274.80 --> 282.16]  like i grew up in the church and i was just like what should i be expecting of the person of the
[282.16 --> 287.90]  holy spirit like is this something i should be hearing every day from it like what's the expectation
[287.90 --> 293.98]  for us from the spirit i want to ask that as a sort of a big picture question for this whole sermon series
[293.98 --> 304.72]  do we know what we have in the gift of the holy spirit do we know what is available to us through the
[304.72 --> 313.40]  power and the presence of god the spirit do we live with a sense of holy expectation of what is now
[313.40 --> 320.66]  possible for us as believers and as the body of christ through the leading of the holy spirit
[320.66 --> 326.40]  that's one of our big picture questions for the series and i want to say at the outset by the way
[326.40 --> 330.64]  before we get to our passage we have a number of people in our church who are exploring christianity or
[330.64 --> 334.36]  just kind of sorting out what it is christians believe and i praise the lord that you're here and
[334.36 --> 341.00]  i want to say one of the most beautiful and mysterious parts of the christian faith is that we serve one god
[341.00 --> 348.22]  who is three persons there was a time in my life where i tried to explain away how that works and i just want
[348.22 --> 352.00]  you to know that's a beautiful mystery and i no longer try to do that because the bible presents
[352.00 --> 358.58]  this as reality god the father god the son god the holy spirit is reality and is one god three persons
[358.58 --> 365.30]  there's a diagram i put on the screen this diagram represents the church protecting the person of god
[365.30 --> 370.60]  the god father son and spirit from a lot of heresy i won't get into all the details but many times people
[370.60 --> 375.56]  try to fuse the three persons of the trinity into a sort of one god that has three presentations
[375.56 --> 382.88]  or three different gods altogether and we have one god father son and spirit and the scripture just
[382.88 --> 390.06]  presents us with that reality and we receive that we have a father who is most notably known as creator
[390.06 --> 397.30]  who made this world with purpose and with a design and a plan we have a son jesus christ who is sent to
[397.30 --> 403.80]  accomplish that plan and we have a spirit who is sent to work out the power of jesus make known the
[403.80 --> 409.80]  person of jesus until jesus comes again and one of my favorite books by the way as it relates to the
[409.80 --> 416.90]  trinity god father father son and holy spirit is the book of john jesus speaks in a lot of trinitarian
[416.90 --> 422.72]  and profound ways and a couple weeks ago you might remember when we were looking at acts chapter one
[422.72 --> 429.82]  we we highlighted how jesus in his earthly ministry he said to his disciples i'm gonna die i'm gonna rise
[429.82 --> 433.34]  back to life but he went beyond that he said i'm actually gonna go to be with the father and
[433.34 --> 437.96]  then i'm gonna send you the spirit and i don't think they had any idea what was going on or how
[437.96 --> 443.08]  this could be possible but i'll read for you this is from john chapter 16 where jesus prepares them for
[443.08 --> 449.02]  what is coming which just reminds us by the way all of what happens in the scriptures was part of god's
[449.02 --> 453.76]  plan nothing is accidental haphazard this is part of god's plan listen to what jesus says
[453.76 --> 461.36]  but now i'm going to him who sent me none of you asks me where are you going rather you are filled
[461.36 --> 466.42]  with grief because i've said these things and just a parenthetical note jesus uh in the previous passage
[466.42 --> 472.04]  talks about the suffering that's going to come to the church verse seven but very truly i tell you it is
[472.04 --> 481.24]  for your good that i am going away because unless i go away the advocate the spirit will not come to you
[481.24 --> 489.36]  but if i go i will send him to you i don't know about you but i have a feeling if i'm imagining the
[489.36 --> 494.24]  disciples in this scene i think that was a tough sell for them right they're like you know we really
[494.24 --> 499.30]  like having you here jesus it's very wonderful your physical presence your healing your teaching what
[499.30 --> 504.66]  you're doing you know like they they loved being with jesus as we would and i think they're like what
[504.66 --> 510.54]  why would you go away and what what is the advocate like this is a very confusing thing they had no frame
[510.54 --> 519.84]  for making sense of these words until pentecost until acts chapter 2 where they did what jesus told
[519.84 --> 525.90]  him to do he said stay in jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high and so now we get
[525.90 --> 531.22]  to acts chapter 2 and i want to name first the importance of what's going on what does it say in
[531.22 --> 537.18]  the first verse when the day of pentecost came now we can skip over this because we we sort of have
[537.18 --> 542.12]  this assumption of what it is but pentecost then was a huge celebration for the jewish people
[542.12 --> 547.24]  it was a day off in the city everyone would be taking time away from their work gathering with
[547.24 --> 552.24]  family getting involved in the city it's huge and there are two particular things that happened at
[552.24 --> 559.74]  pentecost the first is they remembered their story specifically they remembered the good law that god
[559.74 --> 564.78]  gave his people they remembered the generosity of god leading his people but the second thing is
[564.78 --> 570.58]  pentecost was an agricultural harvest celebration where farmers i mean this is a bit removed for some
[570.58 --> 575.60]  of us very few of us are farmers we did have them in the 9 a.m they get the first fruit of their crops
[575.60 --> 583.48]  they take sheaves of wheat and they offer them as a gratitude to god with hopeful anticipation that
[583.48 --> 588.38]  the rest of the crop is still coming and god will provide that's what they're doing and it was like big
[588.38 --> 593.04]  feast celebration god's going to take care of them and this is a really important connection
[593.04 --> 599.40]  that harvest feast in some sense becomes a picture what the church is one commentator says that the
[599.40 --> 605.96]  church then becomes actually this first fruits as god fills the church with his holy spirit he creates
[605.96 --> 611.42]  a new humanity human beings that are full of the life of god filled with the power of the spirit
[611.42 --> 618.56]  becoming what they are created to be and they become the first fruit of many who come after them
[618.56 --> 626.00]  a harvest that follows them and church can i pause and say we are part of that harvest we today as the
[626.00 --> 633.56]  church of jesus christ by faith in jesus we have the spirit we join the generations of believers who go
[633.56 --> 640.90]  before us in being part of the family of the new humanity people who have the gift of the spirit
[640.90 --> 649.54]  one of the things i love about this passage is the way luke describes the event i i almost think he
[649.54 --> 656.26]  he had trouble describing what's going on like how do you describe this event i mean again just imagine
[656.26 --> 663.36]  this with me i'll read it again luke writes they were all together in one place suddenly a sound like
[663.36 --> 669.16]  the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting can you
[669.16 --> 675.66]  picture that they saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them
[675.66 --> 682.50]  all of them were filled with the spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit enabled them
[682.50 --> 691.62]  i mean what a scene don't you think a violent wind blowing in the place tongues of fire somehow resting on
[691.62 --> 698.96]  each of the disciples i have a feeling it was terrifying and exhilarating it's like what is happening and
[698.96 --> 703.88]  yet we don't want to be anywhere else right now something is going on and what you need to know
[703.88 --> 709.66]  about this passage is that it is packed and i do mean packed with echoes from the rest of the bible
[709.66 --> 713.74]  like i was thinking of preaching on all these passages but i had to narrow it down because this
[713.74 --> 723.58]  is just so full of old testament imagery wind and fire are both symbols of god's presence perhaps
[723.58 --> 729.80]  most notably we have ezekiel 37 there's a prophet named ezekiel god sends him to this valley where
[729.80 --> 734.66]  there's dry bones i mean this is like a creepy scene but so so remarkable god says to ezekiel
[734.66 --> 740.82]  prophesy to these bones and ezekiel's like god said it i'm gonna do it so he's prophesying to bones
[740.82 --> 747.74]  what happens the breath of god the wind of god brings life to these bones and they sort of take on
[747.74 --> 754.78]  flesh and life and become living beings because of the wind of god the breath of god that's the power
[754.78 --> 760.88]  of god now secondly the image of fire exodus 3 moses in the burning bush takes off his sandals because
[760.88 --> 767.32]  that fire represents the presence of god fast forward 10 chapters god leads his people out of egypt
[767.32 --> 774.28]  he's leading them through the desert and what leads them by night do you remember exodus 13 a pillar of
[774.28 --> 784.76]  fire wind and fire the presence of god the leading of god i also want to say a holy god it's it's not
[784.76 --> 789.88]  lost on me that when moses experienced the fire of that burning bush he stepped back and he took his
[789.88 --> 796.70]  sandals off because this is no small deal this is no small god this is the holy one the god of gods
[796.70 --> 805.18]  showing up in the fire and now that fire comes to the disciples but there's a third passage
[805.18 --> 810.84]  that really needs to be talked about in relation to pentecost and that comes from the book of joel
[810.84 --> 815.12]  in the book of joel and actually there's more than one prophecy on this but it talks about the spirit
[815.12 --> 820.24]  coming in the last days and i'll just back up a little bit one of the things that's remarkable
[820.24 --> 825.92]  about acts 2 is that when the disciples all start speaking in different languages people from the city
[825.92 --> 829.90]  who are watching them you know what they said to them right like these people are drunk like their
[829.90 --> 834.28]  only frame for understanding what's going on like these people have had too much to drink and i love
[834.28 --> 840.50]  peter's defense you know what he says we're not drunk it's 9 a.m you gotta love the bible i mean luke
[840.50 --> 845.88]  included that detail it's amazing take us seriously it's 9 a.m like it's not dinner time or like evening
[845.88 --> 850.68]  maybe we'd have a drink then but we're not drunk it's it's the morning but listen to then what he quotes
[850.68 --> 858.64]  in this verse it says in the last days god says i will pour out my spirit on all people
[858.64 --> 865.32]  your sons and daughters will prophesy your young men will see visions your old men will dream dreams
[865.32 --> 872.22]  even on my servants both men and women i will pour out my spirit in those days and they will prophesy
[872.22 --> 877.96]  and just a few verses later we read and everyone who calls on the name of the lord
[877.96 --> 880.62]  will be saved
[880.62 --> 887.50]  this verse is super important because it brings us not just back to the old testament it points us to
[887.50 --> 891.36]  the forward this is something that took me a long time to learn about the pouring of the spirit the
[891.36 --> 896.72]  old testament envisioned that when the spirit is given however that was to look it's the the end
[896.72 --> 901.88]  that's the end of history that's where god brings his total renewal the spirit is the sign of the end
[901.88 --> 907.46]  that he's filling the world with the fullness of the life of god by his spirit that marks the end
[907.46 --> 913.68]  and what peter is saying is the end has come in fact i was going to sort of humorously name this
[913.68 --> 918.28]  sermon the beginning of the end but you would have been like what an ominously dark sounding sermon
[918.28 --> 925.36]  but that's exactly what this is the life that is going to fill the entire creation by the power of
[925.36 --> 933.24]  the spirit when jesus returns breaks into the present at pentecost and what that means is the spirit of
[933.24 --> 939.58]  god enables us now oh man i love this to taste and experience the way the world is going to be
[939.58 --> 947.32]  when jesus returns so think about this the love of god that you will be filled with when jesus returns
[947.32 --> 954.44]  you can already now experience by the power of the spirit the justice and the mercy of god that
[954.44 --> 959.28]  will fill the earth and make peace in the nations in fact just after the 9 a.m service i was talking
[959.28 --> 963.32]  to three ukrainian women who were telling me a bit about their story and the hardship they're going
[963.32 --> 968.34]  through but the justice and mercy that will one day fill the earth we can already begin to taste now
[968.34 --> 974.42]  by the life of the spirit the richness and the harmony of relationships and family and friends and
[974.42 --> 979.02]  all the rest that we will have in fullness in the end breaks into the present as we follow the life
[979.02 --> 987.38]  of the spirit right now in short when the spirit of god comes it's the beginning of the end
[987.38 --> 993.38]  and when the spirit of god is at work in the church we become who we were created to be from the beginning
[993.38 --> 1002.00]  before sin before rebellion and who we will be when jesus returns in glory we already taste that now
[1002.00 --> 1011.82]  as we receive the gift of the holy spirit we are becoming a new humanity do you see the gift
[1011.82 --> 1018.20]  that is the holy spirit i'm going to make this comment in future sermons but i'll make it now as well
[1018.20 --> 1025.06]  when the spirit is poured out in this passage it's a very dramatic very memorable event like wind and fire
[1025.06 --> 1029.96]  and power there's a lot going on and it's important to note that throughout the book of acts and even in
[1029.96 --> 1037.64]  the church today so much of the spirit's work is the slow gradual transformation i think the suspicion
[1037.64 --> 1041.16]  that i grew up in the church of some of the charismatic tradition and i love my charismatic
[1041.16 --> 1045.92]  friends friends with a number of charismatic pastors but almost an overemphasis of the dramatic
[1045.92 --> 1051.98]  at the expense of the ordinary an overemphasis of the gifts of the spirit which are present and real
[1051.98 --> 1057.56]  we believe that at the expense of the fruits of the spirit the slow gradual becoming more loving to
[1057.56 --> 1064.52]  neighbor loving towards enemy generous with resources kind to those around us long suffering in the face
[1064.52 --> 1070.84]  of difficulty all those things are the work of the spirit making us more like jesus more full of the
[1070.84 --> 1073.56]  father's love more led by the spirit
[1076.84 --> 1082.52]  what's the first thing that these apostles do once they're filled with the spirit
[1082.52 --> 1090.76]  what does it say at the very end of our passage they began to speak in tongues now we're going to
[1090.76 --> 1094.12]  come back to this in the series as well but i'll just say it's very important for luke that when we
[1094.12 --> 1098.92]  hear tongues he's just saying different languages in fact there's a god-fearing jews from all over
[1098.92 --> 1104.44]  they're all gathered in jerusalem and what do they do they all hear about jesus from these apostles in their
[1104.44 --> 1110.20]  own language that must have been quite a scene hey they're sitting there they have a different language
[1110.20 --> 1114.28]  all of a sudden they're like whoa i understand that this person's speaking about jesus he's
[1114.28 --> 1119.80]  speaking about what's happening in a way that i could hear it and this represents i cannot overstate
[1119.80 --> 1127.32]  this a monumental shift in the story of the bible up until this point god's people were one nation
[1127.32 --> 1133.64]  in one place with one language and now as the spirit moves in the church as it empowers the church
[1133.64 --> 1138.92]  they are speaking in multiple language being sent to multiple places because god is a global god
[1138.92 --> 1143.64]  god and i'll just stop and point out do we have our translators oh we have a number of translators
[1143.64 --> 1148.76]  in the 9 a.m service they're the trinity western students studying linguistics doing the hard work
[1148.76 --> 1154.52]  of working with people groups who do not yet have the word of god in their own language because we
[1154.52 --> 1160.76]  believe the scripture should be understood in all the languages of the earth so people can hear it
[1161.64 --> 1165.16]  believe it and call on the name of the lord and receive salvation
[1165.16 --> 1174.52]  god is a global god and he pours out his spirit to send his church into his world to make jesus known
[1174.52 --> 1181.88]  so that everyone who calls on him will be saved and filled with the spirit you know i know we're
[1181.88 --> 1187.96]  not charismatic but that's the point at which you can say amen i love you church
[1187.96 --> 1195.64]  this week i was originally going to preach this sermon that traced the movement of the holy spirit
[1195.64 --> 1199.40]  through the whole bible and that became a just a massive sermon and so i'm going to trace very
[1199.40 --> 1204.76]  briefly how the spirit of god was before the creation of the world the spirit is at work in
[1204.76 --> 1209.08]  fact in genesis 1 we said the spirit of god was hovering over the waters and throughout the old
[1209.08 --> 1214.84]  testament we see the specific moments where the spirit spilled specific people for a specific task but
[1214.84 --> 1219.32]  there's a sense in which it's limited right i was just reading my own devotions how king david the
[1219.32 --> 1224.68]  spirit rushed into him so that he would be a leader of after god's own heart the spirit filled him to
[1224.68 --> 1230.68]  lead well the prophets the spirit compels them to prophesy to actually so much of the prophecy by the way
[1230.68 --> 1236.28]  is to call the people of god to repent and come back to god and the spirit enabled them to do that but
[1236.28 --> 1242.52]  there's a sense in which it's limited to a time limited to a place limited to a person and then we get to
[1242.52 --> 1251.08]  acts 2 where god as it were he just dumps the life of the spirit on all the church for good to stay
[1251.08 --> 1257.56]  not just a moment not just an event not just one place the spirit of god is poured out into our lives
[1257.56 --> 1269.64]  to be received and lived and tasted and transforming us and that leads to my lament as i think about that
[1269.64 --> 1277.24]  reality as i think about pentecost sunday and what it means for the church my lament is why is it that
[1277.24 --> 1289.16]  we just limp along in our own strength when god the spirit is ours why in the world do we just coast along
[1290.12 --> 1295.88]  trying to be our own saviors trying to solve all our own problems just trying to be the center of our own
[1295.88 --> 1306.52]  lives when the spirit of the living god is ours why is it that we do not call on the name of the lord
[1306.52 --> 1313.48]  to help us to change us to break our addictions to move us into reconciliation and all the rest what is
[1313.48 --> 1322.60]  it that we expect of the holy spirit in our lives when's the last time you called on god the spirit to
[1322.60 --> 1328.68]  really show up because you needed him to when's the last time you expected great things of god
[1329.32 --> 1337.48]  in your life your marriage your family your work your broken relationships your places of deep shame
[1340.44 --> 1347.32]  john tyson a pastor in new york he shared a line in a sermon i listened to years ago it caught me off
[1347.32 --> 1352.84]  guard because i wanted to nuance it and i will but it caught my attention because it rings so true he
[1352.84 --> 1359.48]  said the holy spirit comes where he is welcomed the holy spirit comes where he is welcome he is not
[1359.48 --> 1364.76]  limited the wind blows where it blows the spirit shows up in my life and yours i'm sure in unexpected
[1364.76 --> 1370.68]  ways but the spirit certainly comes where he is welcomed and when i say that what i often am
[1370.68 --> 1378.68]  focusing on is the spirit moves in response to prayer and i've said this before in our church
[1378.68 --> 1384.28]  and i'll say it again all the work that's been done tracing revivals in church history where there's
[1384.28 --> 1389.88]  large groups of people who feel the power of god and repent and come to faith in jesus it always starts
[1390.84 --> 1396.68]  with prayer and i'll even focus that more and one of the books i read on it talked about it's the old
[1396.68 --> 1402.52]  ladies in the church who are praying and watch out when old ladies in the church start praying
[1402.52 --> 1408.04]  things start to happen and all of a sudden these people who are tired of sin they're tired of sin
[1408.04 --> 1413.32]  wrecking their families wrecking their city they begin to pray and lament and groan inwardly in the
[1413.32 --> 1420.12]  words of the spirit that change would happen god shows up hearts begin to change families start to heal
[1420.12 --> 1424.20]  cities begin to experience the power of god because the spirit is on the move
[1424.20 --> 1430.60]  when's the last time you asked for that when's the last time we expected him to do something like that
[1430.60 --> 1438.36]  in our own church this week i was on my study leave uh taking a course in phoenix yes i know there are
[1438.36 --> 1443.96]  worse places to take courses and i had the privilege of going to a number of churches there and hearing
[1443.96 --> 1448.60]  their stories how they're serving the city and the pastors were very honest about some of the challenges
[1448.60 --> 1452.76]  they faced in their context some of the challenges after covid some of the challenge with the
[1452.76 --> 1457.48]  politics of their area and just the brokenness of their cities and their churches and i felt like
[1457.48 --> 1462.68]  god was really stirring in me as i listened but three of them talked about how hard ministry has
[1462.68 --> 1466.84]  been how hard some of their personal challenges have been in the church and they said you know i was
[1466.84 --> 1470.76]  i was just stuck there's nothing i could do as a pastor i couldn't solve this problem i couldn't
[1470.76 --> 1475.08]  deal with these issues in the city and so i just started to pray and we started to call on
[1475.08 --> 1479.48]  god to do something because we needed him we didn't have the brains or the ideas of the strategies
[1479.48 --> 1483.88]  to solve it and then they said then god just started to move because that's what god does
[1484.60 --> 1493.00]  in response to prayer the spirit of god desires to bring about changes in our city and partner with
[1493.00 --> 1500.60]  us as we call on him to move what are we expecting the spirit of god to do in our lives
[1502.12 --> 1507.48]  the spirit of god to do in our relationships in the places where we experience the deepest crisis
[1507.48 --> 1515.00]  are you willing to call on the spirit to bring about change to lead us into making jesus known
[1515.48 --> 1518.28]  to be bold witnesses for the sake of the gospel
[1521.16 --> 1531.24]  i'll finish simply by saying this the spirit of god was sent as a gift to transform us in the way of
[1531.24 --> 1538.92]  jesus to embolden us and strengthen us and empower us to make jesus known church let this be our season of
[1538.92 --> 1545.08]  receiving that gift would you pray with me
[1545.08 --> 1561.56]  father we praise you father son and holy spirit thank you for the gift of the holy spirit who is here
[1561.56 --> 1570.36]  with us even now as we pray we thank you for the way that you lead us you show up in our lives sometimes
[1570.36 --> 1574.20]  uninvited or even unwelcome when we thank you for the way you are patient with us
[1576.60 --> 1583.56]  lord we're not smart enough we're not strong enough we're not patient enough or loving enough
[1584.20 --> 1589.88]  to be faithful witnesses in our city faithful in our marriages and our responsibilities and our work
[1589.88 --> 1597.88]  and so we pray holy spirit that you would fill us so that we would come alive specifically in the
[1597.88 --> 1604.84]  places where there is the most deadness and rebellion and sin in our lives and in our community as a
[1604.84 --> 1613.48]  church bring renewal in us so that we could bear witness to the renewing power of jesus in our city
[1615.32 --> 1625.88]  we love you we trust you and we depend on you amen would you stand and sing with me our song of response
[1627.88 --> 1654.84]  what uh
