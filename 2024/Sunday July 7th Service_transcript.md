[0.00 --> 12.74]  Good morning.
[14.74 --> 20.80]  It's good to be with you this morning and open God's Word with you and do some thinking
[20.80 --> 24.62]  together and we pray that the Lord bless our time together.
[24.62 --> 32.00]  As has been mentioned, we're in the start of a new series for the summer called Hard
[32.00 --> 33.26]  Sayings of Jesus.
[34.66 --> 42.50]  In the Gospels, we see a variety of reactions from people to things Jesus said.
[43.66 --> 50.20]  The writers of the Gospel describe people as amazed, astonished, just amazed that Jesus
[50.20 --> 53.86]  said what he did and how wonderful it was to hear those things.
[53.86 --> 58.30]  But there's sometimes other reactions and we're going to talk a little bit about those.
[58.76 --> 62.16]  And then the crowds and the disciples reacted in a different way.
[63.02 --> 66.06]  I'm going to read a little bit out of John 6 here.
[67.04 --> 73.06]  But Jesus had just said something about him being the, eat my body, drink my blood, you
[73.06 --> 76.78]  know, that he's the bread of life and the crowds are not liking it.
[77.16 --> 81.50]  And so look at it with me and look at the reaction here where we read in John 6.
[81.50 --> 87.40]  On hearing it, many of his disciples, his followers said, this is a hard teaching.
[87.84 --> 89.22]  Who can accept it?
[90.52 --> 92.60]  So at this point, they're not amazed, they're struggling.
[93.48 --> 94.76]  And then I jump ahead a bit.
[94.86 --> 98.56]  From this time, many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.
[99.92 --> 101.84]  You do not want to leave too, do you?
[102.06 --> 103.60]  Jesus asked the twelve.
[103.60 --> 107.24]  And Simon Peter answered, Lord, to whom shall we go?
[107.58 --> 109.22]  You have the words of eternal life.
[109.58 --> 113.34]  We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.
[115.12 --> 117.36]  I feel kind of like Peter there, right?
[117.56 --> 121.88]  Sometimes we follow even if we don't completely comprehend and understand.
[122.80 --> 126.08]  But yeah, Jesus said some hard things.
[126.08 --> 131.04]  That were hard to live out, sometimes hard to understand.
[132.26 --> 135.56]  He said things like, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for
[135.56 --> 136.82]  a rich man to enter God's kingdom.
[136.98 --> 139.12]  And some people might have thrown up their arms and said, what?
[139.24 --> 140.32]  What's he talking about here?
[140.76 --> 143.44]  And some people, as it said here, even quit following him.
[144.62 --> 147.06]  Like the twelve, though, they said, we're going to follow.
[147.20 --> 151.74]  But that didn't mean they always understood what Jesus was exactly saying.
[151.74 --> 153.28]  And maybe you can relate.
[154.50 --> 159.84]  You know, I don't always get what Jesus said, but I trust him anyways, and then I struggle
[159.84 --> 160.58]  to understand.
[160.78 --> 161.88]  And that's what we're going to do together.
[162.18 --> 165.94]  We're going to look at some of these hard things Jesus said, and we're going to unpack
[165.94 --> 167.22]  them a bit with you this summer.
[167.90 --> 172.92]  And I'm kicking off the series with something out of Mark 11.
[173.14 --> 178.40]  I'm going to read a bigger chunk of the passage, but it has to do with the moving of mountains.
[178.40 --> 182.24]  We're going to get to that in a moment, but let's read Mark 11, starting at verse 12.
[182.78 --> 185.24]  You can open up your own Bibles or read it up on the screen.
[187.16 --> 190.42]  The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.
[191.22 --> 195.88]  Seeing in the distance a fig tree and leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit.
[196.20 --> 200.06]  When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.
[200.40 --> 204.00]  And then he said to the tree, may no one ever eat fruit from you again.
[204.00 --> 207.36]  The disciples heard him say it.
[208.22 --> 212.46]  On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were
[212.46 --> 213.62]  buying and selling there.
[213.94 --> 218.92]  He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves, and
[218.92 --> 222.52]  would not allow anyone to carry merchandise throughout the temple courts.
[222.98 --> 227.52]  As he taught them, he said, is it not written, my house will be called a house of prayer for
[227.52 --> 230.04]  all nations, but you've made it a den of robbers.
[230.04 --> 235.02]  The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way
[235.02 --> 236.86]  to kill him, for they feared him.
[237.42 --> 241.74]  Because the whole crowd, here's a reaction again, the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.
[242.92 --> 245.60]  When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.
[246.30 --> 249.56]  In the morning, as they went along, they saw that fig tree withered from the roots.
[250.06 --> 253.82]  Peter remembered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, look, the fig tree you cursed has withered.
[255.16 --> 257.12]  Have faith in God, Jesus answered.
[257.66 --> 259.74]  And then here's the passage we're going to look at this morning.
[260.48 --> 266.16]  Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, go throw yourself into the sea, and does not
[266.16 --> 270.58]  doubt in their hearts, but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.
[271.06 --> 275.58]  Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received and
[275.58 --> 276.38]  it will be yours.
[277.02 --> 282.02]  And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father
[282.02 --> 284.10]  in heaven may forgive your sins.
[284.10 --> 293.70]  In our passage, we see Jesus cursing an unfruitful fig tree, and then later it withers, much to
[293.70 --> 294.70]  the disciples' amazement.
[295.14 --> 300.14]  He also calls people out for the misuse of the temple, turning it into a business place,
[300.22 --> 300.98]  a den of thieves.
[301.48 --> 305.46]  And Jesus says to the twelve then, when they kind of question him a little bit, like, wow,
[305.46 --> 307.16]  look what you did there to that fig tree.
[307.56 --> 309.50]  This is, have faith in God.
[311.34 --> 317.34]  Trusting God then is the responsibility of all who follow, because sometimes it's hard.
[318.66 --> 324.34]  Last week, Pastor Jonathan preached on the fruit of the Spirit, and he recited a verse,
[324.42 --> 330.46]  John 15, 5, where it says, you are the branches, Jesus says, I am the vine, apart from me you can
[330.46 --> 335.38]  do nothing, right, and I love that verse here, but basically, when we trust, somehow there's
[335.38 --> 340.12]  fruit, and God brings fruit through, through the work that we might do.
[340.88 --> 345.96]  But if not fruit, and if we don't trust, then we wither and die, kind of like the fig tree,
[346.58 --> 348.58]  and we bear no fruit.
[350.22 --> 356.46]  And then the passage that I read today, this morning, earlier, where it says, truly I tell
[356.46 --> 357.62]  you, anyone says it's a mountain.
[357.62 --> 361.58]  Come to this mountain, go throw yourself in the sea, and does not doubt in their heart,
[361.64 --> 363.88]  but believes that it'll happen, it'll be done for them.
[364.78 --> 368.34]  Therefore, I tell you, whenever you ask in prayer, believe that you received it, and it
[368.34 --> 369.28]  will be yours.
[369.54 --> 370.94]  And that's what I want to talk about now.
[372.18 --> 375.18]  Jesus is saying, with genuine faith, you can move some mountains.
[376.50 --> 382.96]  Life is found through faith, death through unfaithfulness, and the fig tree is an illustration.
[383.52 --> 384.72]  Have faith.
[384.72 --> 384.76]  Faith.
[385.82 --> 389.40]  So whatever you ask in faith, moving mountains, you will have.
[389.46 --> 390.32]  So let's talk about that.
[391.88 --> 395.58]  Jesus and his disciples are near the Mount of Olives, and from that viewpoint, they see
[395.58 --> 398.82]  a mountain, and on it, that mountain is the Herodian Fortress.
[398.92 --> 400.52]  And I'm going to show a picture of it here.
[400.52 --> 408.52]  When we, my wife and I were with a group on our trip to Israel, we saw this, this mountain,
[409.28 --> 414.58]  and on this mountain is this kind of castle palace thing that King Herod the Great built.
[414.94 --> 416.16]  He was quite the builder.
[417.50 --> 422.00]  Later on, before he dies, he converts the whole thing into a mausoleum for himself because
[422.00 --> 422.94]  he has no ego.
[424.68 --> 430.62]  Later, he, ironically, it was used by the Jews who were rebelling against the Roman Empire
[430.62 --> 431.22]  at that time.
[431.42 --> 433.56]  But now it's just ruins.
[433.56 --> 440.38]  It was an incredible display of power, of skill, and of arrogance.
[441.52 --> 448.94]  Some scholars, and the one that led our group, Pastor George, think that Jesus was pointing
[448.94 --> 458.08]  at this mountain when he said, you can tell that mountain to fall into the sea with faith,
[458.74 --> 459.42]  and it will.
[460.60 --> 466.66]  Basically saying, that kind of power that Herod displayed will be overcome.
[468.00 --> 471.04]  Remember, Israel is under Roman occupation and oppression.
[471.36 --> 476.74]  When they see that mountain, they're reminded again who's in charge, at least so it seems.
[476.74 --> 479.14]  And Jesus said, have faith.
[479.22 --> 481.08]  You know, you were impressed with that fig tree thing.
[481.44 --> 485.94]  Well, look at that power and then know there's a greater power at work.
[486.36 --> 491.16]  Trust God then to deal with whatever that power is in your life.
[491.88 --> 492.70]  Faith and trust.
[493.04 --> 495.92]  Don't embrace doubt even when it comes because it will.
[496.46 --> 498.28]  Trust me in everything.
[498.28 --> 498.46]  Trust me in everything.
[501.90 --> 507.62]  We have this tendency as people to think that our problems are just that.
[508.48 --> 509.76]  Our problems.
[510.44 --> 512.06]  For us to solve.
[512.20 --> 513.54]  And I'm not saying we don't do our part.
[514.58 --> 518.02]  But too often we make it all about ourselves, and then we get off track.
[519.04 --> 520.36]  And what happens then?
[520.42 --> 524.12]  Well, then the temple gets used for man's purpose instead of what God intended for.
[524.12 --> 526.72]  We turn it into a den of thieves instead of a house of prayer.
[527.56 --> 531.86]  And the fig tree wasn't living out God-given purpose that God had for it.
[532.10 --> 535.04]  Without trust in God, we wither.
[535.44 --> 537.62]  We misuse our lives and our purposes.
[539.26 --> 542.12]  So, yes, there's that mountain.
[544.18 --> 547.28]  And with trust in God, it can be removed.
[547.28 --> 548.28]  It's interesting.
[548.28 --> 552.28]  It's interesting.
[553.04 --> 556.76]  In a weird way, King Herod kind of moved a mountain.
[557.26 --> 558.90]  Not the whole thing, but some of it.
[559.66 --> 562.74]  But he moved it kind of for himself, for his project.
[563.70 --> 565.28]  The people looked at that mountain.
[565.40 --> 565.92]  They saw it.
[565.96 --> 566.70]  They lived under it.
[566.96 --> 570.56]  And Jesus said, if you are trusting yourself, there you go.
[571.50 --> 574.52]  Keep staring at the mountain that you can't move.
[574.52 --> 589.44]  But if you trust me, and you ask me to rid you of false powers, and watch me dismantle lies and powers that are contrary to mine, I will do that.
[590.56 --> 593.32]  Pray, believing that God is able.
[593.32 --> 602.78]  Now, we're not talking here about the name and claim it kind of thing, where you just say something, and then God does it because you said it.
[603.88 --> 607.08]  Where all you have to do is name it, and then God's going to do it.
[607.74 --> 610.26]  So, we just say, well, gee, I want world peace.
[610.34 --> 610.84]  Okay, boom.
[610.96 --> 611.98]  I'm going to ask God, now what?
[612.04 --> 612.68]  Boom, world peace.
[613.04 --> 615.38]  Of course, we pray for world peace.
[615.52 --> 616.96]  We pray for it constantly.
[616.96 --> 622.62]  And then we do trust that God, in his time and in his ways, will accomplish world peace.
[622.78 --> 624.70]  That's what salvation ultimately does.
[625.92 --> 630.12]  Be reminded, Herod's power did not last.
[631.22 --> 633.64]  His palace was left in ruins.
[634.48 --> 637.46]  The Roman Empire, the mighty, mighty Roman Empire fell.
[638.00 --> 639.92]  And God's kingdom endures forever.
[640.38 --> 641.68]  Jesus has overcome.
[642.14 --> 644.64]  That power was thrown into the sea.
[644.64 --> 647.64]  That power was thrown into the sea.
[648.92 --> 652.62]  And Jesus says a lot about prayer in Scripture.
[653.64 --> 655.96]  At one point, Jesus says, thy will be done.
[656.06 --> 662.64]  So, yes, then we say, whatever, ask whatever, in a desire to see God's will being done in the world.
[663.98 --> 667.64]  And then we need to hear all of what God has for us to hear in Scripture.
[668.14 --> 673.80]  I was thinking of Matthew 18, right, where we read again, Jesus says, truly I tell you,
[673.80 --> 679.24]  if two or three on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
[679.72 --> 683.66]  For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.
[685.40 --> 687.26]  You say, okay, okay, that sounds good.
[687.86 --> 690.08]  So how many of you want the war in Ukraine to end?
[691.68 --> 693.54]  Yeah, I mean, there's a few of us, right?
[693.54 --> 696.70]  And say, or poverty to end, or cancer to go away.
[696.86 --> 697.80]  And we agree, done.
[698.12 --> 698.98]  Problem solved.
[699.10 --> 700.58]  That's not how this is going.
[702.78 --> 709.64]  I like the whole verse, but verse 20, it says, for where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.
[709.64 --> 715.90]  And somehow when we gather, yes, of course, we call out to God and ask him to change things.
[716.44 --> 718.40]  But we do it according to his will.
[720.00 --> 723.64]  And we trust that he's with us, and he's busy in it all.
[723.80 --> 725.44]  And we haven't got it all figured out.
[727.60 --> 728.56]  Trust him, yes.
[728.66 --> 733.88]  And then pray, and then ask with all your heart, trust that God is at work in you and around you.
[733.88 --> 741.30]  Last week, I shared a little bit about what Hope Community did about eight, nine years ago.
[742.46 --> 746.56]  When we were building, we were going to build, and we thought we had everything in order.
[746.68 --> 749.30]  And then we found out we couldn't get the money, and the whole project was going to end.
[749.90 --> 753.16]  And then we decided then at that point, we're going to do a prayer walk.
[753.72 --> 757.72]  And every day, someone was going to walk around this empty piece of property and pray.
[758.10 --> 759.36]  And we did that for a whole summer.
[759.52 --> 762.52]  And then at the end of the summer, we had another construction company,
[762.52 --> 764.86]  and they submitted it with a lot less.
[764.98 --> 768.56]  And we went back to the powers that be, and they approved.
[768.68 --> 771.56]  And we were allowed to build when we thought we were done, right?
[773.26 --> 778.02]  But I'm convinced walking through prayer was a huge part of that.
[778.82 --> 779.80]  Seeking God's leading.
[780.06 --> 781.68]  We're doing a prayer walk now too, by the way.
[781.74 --> 783.94]  And for those of you who, I encourage you to sign up.
[784.02 --> 787.44]  There's a link and all that to join our prayer walk.
[787.56 --> 789.56]  There's even paper, Valerie talked about it.
[789.56 --> 795.30]  But we're going to walk this property, and we're going to, every day, somebody's going to be walking this property and praying.
[795.60 --> 799.62]  Because we want to see what God is up to, and we want to get in on that.
[801.58 --> 803.02]  Doing things in His name.
[804.02 --> 810.72]  And trusting Him to do what He is going to do.
[810.72 --> 815.22]  And when we pray, and when we cry out to God, we can be assured God hears us.
[815.30 --> 816.64]  We can be assured He cares.
[816.98 --> 819.10]  And we can be assured God hears our prayers.
[819.48 --> 822.28]  And His answers and His will are perfect.
[822.60 --> 824.36]  Even when we may think otherwise.
[826.24 --> 829.16]  Jesus Himself prayed at one point in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[829.26 --> 831.18]  Lord, please take this cup, take this cup.
[831.40 --> 832.10]  And God said, no.
[833.56 --> 834.58]  And Jesus said, okay then.
[835.28 --> 836.32]  Thy perfect will be done.
[836.32 --> 839.40]  That's a prayer that trusts God.
[840.62 --> 844.66]  So yes, Lord, please, please move that mountain, whatever that mountain is for you.
[845.08 --> 846.12]  And I want to ask you that.
[846.36 --> 848.98]  Are there mountains in your life that are impacting you?
[849.30 --> 852.20]  Health concerns, physical or mental health concerns.
[852.68 --> 853.86]  Relational conflicts.
[854.24 --> 854.68]  Addictions.
[855.18 --> 856.16]  Economic problems.
[856.34 --> 856.70]  Loneliness.
[856.90 --> 857.30]  Despair.
[857.60 --> 857.90]  Fear.
[858.04 --> 858.54]  Anxiety.
[858.86 --> 859.30]  Issues.
[859.66 --> 860.80]  Yes, of course there is.
[860.80 --> 862.64]  We all have some of that in our lives.
[862.96 --> 864.20]  And we want it gone.
[866.32 --> 868.62]  We want it gone, of course.
[870.18 --> 872.60]  And we trust that God somehow is going to work in all that.
[873.20 --> 875.60]  And we do say it out loud.
[876.56 --> 880.78]  It's interesting to me in our passage out of Mark 11, you know, the verse that I ended on.
[881.18 --> 884.02]  After, you know, saying ask anything in prayer and receive it.
[884.40 --> 886.92]  But then this verse, which seems like it doesn't belong.
[887.42 --> 887.82]  Verse 25.
[887.96 --> 892.18]  And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them.
[892.18 --> 894.74]  So that your Father in heaven may forgive you and your sins.
[895.82 --> 897.68]  I thought, wow, why is that suddenly there?
[900.30 --> 901.48]  And I think it's this.
[902.60 --> 906.40]  I think it's important that we do some soul searching.
[906.40 --> 912.00]  Maybe there's some areas in you that need some healing and some honesty.
[912.64 --> 916.44]  And then when you pray, you might pray, Lord, Lord, heal this relationship.
[916.90 --> 918.66]  And yet you hold on to such anger.
[918.86 --> 920.54]  And you haven't looked at your own heart.
[920.72 --> 922.04]  And you've got some work to do.
[922.26 --> 924.98]  And that's God's answer to your prayers.
[926.58 --> 928.72]  Somehow working in you.
[928.72 --> 931.76]  How about this?
[933.16 --> 934.68]  2 Corinthians 12.
[935.38 --> 939.06]  Where Paul has this thorn in the flesh, as it's called.
[939.16 --> 939.76]  This problem.
[940.20 --> 941.46]  We don't even know exactly what it is.
[941.54 --> 942.16]  But he says this.
[942.40 --> 943.48]  Three times I pleaded.
[943.60 --> 947.12]  I'm praying with the Lord to take that thorn away from me.
[947.54 --> 950.58]  But he said to me, my grace is sufficient for you.
[950.86 --> 951.92]  My power is made perfect.
[952.00 --> 952.26]  How?
[952.50 --> 953.32]  In weakness.
[953.32 --> 959.54]  Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.
[959.72 --> 964.40]  Notice how the power comes through simply living in grace.
[965.86 --> 970.24]  Occasionally, I think mountains are placed in our paths as a means of shaping our character.
[971.02 --> 972.44]  Making us more like Christ.
[973.84 --> 979.06]  And like Paul, sometimes I need to learn to rest in God's grace, whatever's happening.
[979.06 --> 983.84]  And yes, we can then ask whatever in alignment with the Father's will.
[984.46 --> 987.04]  But his will over ours.
[987.62 --> 994.76]  And so in this, in this kind of attitude and posture, I need not just speak, but I also need to listen.
[996.56 --> 1001.88]  I need quiet with my Lord so I hear his voice and know his will.
[1004.28 --> 1006.68]  How many of you trust your will completely?
[1006.68 --> 1009.90]  I don't know.
[1011.64 --> 1012.24]  I don't know.
[1012.48 --> 1016.62]  If God came to me and said, hey, you know, can you give me some advice, Sid?
[1016.62 --> 1017.88]  I'd say, no, I can't.
[1019.08 --> 1020.68]  You're best off going elsewhere.
[1022.08 --> 1023.80]  I want to know God's will.
[1025.30 --> 1025.58]  Right?
[1025.88 --> 1029.54]  So yes, make space to hear God in prayer.
[1029.90 --> 1031.06]  And to know his word.
[1031.06 --> 1034.56]  So when you pray, you pray in accordance with the will of God.
[1036.68 --> 1043.64]  According to William Barclay, a theologian, he said the term moving mountains was a common Jewish expression for overcoming difficulties.
[1043.90 --> 1045.32]  I think for us it's often that too.
[1046.12 --> 1051.44]  Jesus is instructing us to speak of our mountains, to share them with God.
[1051.60 --> 1053.20]  I think that's a powerful thing.
[1053.48 --> 1056.68]  We tell God about the mountains that are in our way.
[1056.68 --> 1057.78]  We say them.
[1057.90 --> 1058.90]  We name them.
[1062.34 --> 1066.80]  Otherwise, the mountain will become the focus and remain our focus.
[1066.80 --> 1071.76]  And then we will feel our powerlessness.
[1072.08 --> 1074.58]  Because if it's up to us, we are powerless.
[1075.28 --> 1077.38]  And our joy and our hope will be diminished.
[1077.72 --> 1083.58]  So yes, name your mountains so you can focus on Jesus and then leave the mountains to him.
[1083.58 --> 1090.86]  One of my favorite passages out of Hebrews 12, where we read,
[1091.54 --> 1097.68]  Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything, everything, the attitude, whatever sin,
[1097.94 --> 1100.24]  that so easily entangles us and trips us up.
[1100.54 --> 1103.44]  And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
[1103.64 --> 1104.04]  And here we go.
[1104.54 --> 1105.94]  Fixing our eyes on Jesus.
[1109.40 --> 1110.96]  What do you do when you have a huge problem?
[1110.96 --> 1114.98]  Do you focus on the problem or do you focus on Jesus?
[1116.00 --> 1117.90]  And I'm not saying, again, that we don't do our part.
[1118.22 --> 1118.86]  I'm not saying that.
[1119.06 --> 1120.24]  But there's a focus here.
[1120.88 --> 1127.10]  And the more you focus on your mountains, your pain, your fear, your addiction, your relational struggle, whatever it is,
[1127.30 --> 1130.72]  the more you give it power and the bigger it gets.
[1132.12 --> 1133.50]  I was thinking about this a little bit.
[1133.52 --> 1134.60]  I was thinking about Daniel.
[1135.80 --> 1136.20]  Right?
[1136.28 --> 1137.54]  Daniel in the lion's den.
[1137.70 --> 1137.86]  Right?
[1137.92 --> 1139.14]  Famous Old Testament story.
[1139.14 --> 1142.26]  Daniel won't bow down to Nebuchadnezzar.
[1142.34 --> 1143.94]  He gets tossed into the lion's den.
[1144.32 --> 1146.40]  They figure overnight the lions will eat him up.
[1148.86 --> 1153.26]  And then it talks about how he slept amongst the lions and then was removed alive in the morning.
[1154.24 --> 1157.68]  If you were tossed into a pit of lions, would you focus on the lions?
[1157.68 --> 1162.10]  Yeah, I think I would.
[1163.06 --> 1163.32]  Right?
[1163.42 --> 1165.16]  It would certainly draw your attention.
[1167.48 --> 1172.06]  And yet somehow Daniel didn't let that mountain, those lions, become his focus.
[1172.42 --> 1174.42]  Instead, he had faith in God.
[1174.42 --> 1179.54]  And when he saw God, God was bigger than the mountain.
[1181.08 --> 1184.50]  Then I trust God more than I fear my mountain.
[1185.06 --> 1189.50]  Then I wait for God to act according to his will, his perfect will.
[1189.82 --> 1195.78]  But I do tell God about my mountain because I know he cares and I know he's bigger than those mountains.
[1195.78 --> 1201.38]  And like we see in Hebrews, keep your eyes on Jesus.
[1203.14 --> 1205.64]  Don't let the mountains become your main focus.
[1206.94 --> 1210.56]  Know that God is in it all even when I don't understand it.
[1210.76 --> 1214.34]  He's in it all even when I don't like what's going on.
[1214.34 --> 1222.98]  So people of God, watch where your focus is.
[1224.34 --> 1225.60]  And then pray.
[1226.22 --> 1228.38]  Pray boldly knowing God is able.
[1228.84 --> 1230.64]  And he wants what's best for you.
[1230.98 --> 1234.16]  And God wants you to trust him with all those mountains that you face.
[1234.48 --> 1236.04]  All those things that seem in the way.
[1236.46 --> 1237.28]  Pray faithfully.
[1237.42 --> 1238.32]  Pray believingly.
[1238.62 --> 1239.48]  And look at your heart.
[1239.66 --> 1240.40]  Look at your focus.
[1240.56 --> 1241.24]  Look at your motives.
[1241.24 --> 1244.62]  And don't let sin or doubt keep you from focusing on Jesus.
[1245.06 --> 1245.80]  Trust him.
[1247.08 --> 1252.82]  Because he's the one who has and will deal with all your mountains.
[1253.96 --> 1254.70]  Let's pray.
[1258.16 --> 1268.80]  Dear Lord, we come before you and we thank you for being a God who's so much bigger than any problems we face.
[1268.80 --> 1274.28]  Lord, we sometimes don't understand always what's going on.
[1274.56 --> 1276.48]  And we trust that you do.
[1277.44 --> 1280.72]  And we need to learn to trust that no matter what's going on, you're in it somehow.
[1280.92 --> 1284.12]  And we can cry out to you with anything.
[1284.54 --> 1286.94]  With all the mountains and all the problems and all the struggles.
[1287.28 --> 1288.36]  And know that you hear us.
[1290.12 --> 1293.70]  And know that you are going to bring about restoration somehow.
[1293.70 --> 1300.10]  Lord, may we trust you more than anything else.
[1300.92 --> 1303.56]  May we focus on you more than anything else.
[1304.76 --> 1308.64]  Lord, I just pray that you will give us that kind of focus.
[1309.16 --> 1310.26]  And that kind of strength.
[1310.70 --> 1315.36]  And then we will trust that the mountains we face will be cast into the sea.
[1315.36 --> 1316.34]  Amen.
