[0.00 --> 0.90]  Thank you.
[3.30 --> 4.32]  Good morning, Hope.
[9.82 --> 15.16]  I think every time, for the 11 a.m. at least, when I come up, I get the best greeting ever.
[15.56 --> 17.04]  Good morning to you two. Yes.
[19.16 --> 25.96]  This morning we get to continue on our series that we've been on about our good fight that we lived through.
[25.96 --> 34.34]  We have journeyed through reflecting on how we face the enemy, the devil, and how we face our own flesh, our own sinful natures.
[34.78 --> 41.58]  And now this morning we get to reflect on how we face the temptations of the world, as John names it.
[42.08 --> 48.38]  And so with that short introduction, if you have your Bibles with you, I invite you to turn to 1 John chapter 2.
[49.04 --> 55.44]  1 John chapter 2. This is where Pastor Dave left us off last week.
[55.96 --> 61.74]  With the good news, the gospel message that Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is our advocate.
[62.36 --> 66.84]  And he came as an atoning sacrifice for our sins and the sin of the world.
[67.40 --> 69.28]  That's the gospel message right there.
[69.80 --> 74.62]  And so we continue that gospel story from 1 John, starting in verse 15.
[74.62 --> 79.30]  And we read how John writes to us and God's people.
[79.82 --> 80.36]  It says,
[80.36 --> 106.36]  Amen.
[106.36 --> 112.16]  So thinking about what the world means as we read in our passage,
[112.76 --> 119.16]  the two-part question I want to leave with you during the sermon, and hopefully after the sermon as well, is this,
[119.22 --> 120.82]  and it will be up on the screen for you.
[120.82 --> 129.82]  What sin or patterns of brokenness, so lies and deceptions, and deceptive ideas I should say,
[129.92 --> 135.48]  that is not biblical and not godly, is normalized in our culture today?
[136.44 --> 141.14]  And the second part of the question is, are you aware of such normalized sin?
[141.14 --> 148.14]  Because that's what we, that's what John is talking about when he refers to the world.
[149.14 --> 150.80]  Normalized patterns of sin.
[151.24 --> 154.44]  That gets normalized in the culture that we live in today.
[155.02 --> 159.66]  And so thinking about this, an example that came to me, naturally because I am Korean,
[159.66 --> 163.74]  and I've shared this with many of you in different capacities,
[164.50 --> 171.20]  but one example of the world normalized sin in Korea is around the culture of drinking,
[171.74 --> 172.88]  which is very prominent.
[173.42 --> 175.04]  It's very normalized.
[175.82 --> 177.12]  So alcohol I'm talking about.
[177.62 --> 180.32]  It is a part of almost every dynamic of culture,
[180.46 --> 184.92]  so from funerals to weddings to weekly outings with friends and or co-workers.
[184.92 --> 192.20]  And now before I go on and name this as a normalized sin and call every single Korean sinful,
[192.62 --> 194.72]  which we are, yes, it is the truth,
[194.84 --> 202.40]  but I do believe that this culture around drinking does have some good aspect of fellowship
[202.40 --> 204.32]  and community around this culture.
[205.06 --> 212.12]  That can maybe speak into a hyper-individualist culture of our world here in North America.
[212.12 --> 216.40]  And so what I'm trying to say is this is just an illustration.
[216.94 --> 219.76]  I am not just knocking on my own heritage and culture.
[220.38 --> 224.98]  It is just an illustration to somehow get the idea of the world,
[225.18 --> 227.94]  normalize sin, the idea going in our heads.
[228.18 --> 231.84]  So with that in mind, so in Korea, if you do not drink then,
[232.18 --> 234.50]  if you do not drink and abstain from alcohol,
[234.90 --> 238.92]  whether it be religious reasons, moral reasons, health reasons, whatever it may be,
[238.92 --> 241.12]  you are seen as very counter-cultural.
[242.20 --> 246.04]  And obviously then that leaves the door wide open for Christians
[246.04 --> 251.12]  to explicitly practice being a witness to our identity as Christians
[251.12 --> 253.00]  by abstaining from drinking.
[254.54 --> 257.50]  It is to name and to resist a culture
[257.50 --> 263.02]  where joy and happiness is so tightly bound with consumption of alcohol.
[263.02 --> 268.08]  It is a little bit of what it means to not love the world, as John says for us.
[268.50 --> 271.04]  Again, not an all-encompassing example,
[271.44 --> 275.26]  but an image of a current that pulls us away from God.
[275.60 --> 278.62]  And unless you can name it and resist it,
[279.04 --> 281.86]  you may not know how strong that current is.
[282.52 --> 283.82]  So that is the first step.
[284.06 --> 288.04]  That is an example not from my experience but from my culture.
[288.04 --> 292.86]  And to get a more comprehensive idea of this term,
[293.26 --> 295.56]  the world, from our passage this morning,
[295.62 --> 297.88]  and all throughout the Bible, when it refers to the world,
[298.34 --> 301.66]  there are different definitions and uses of the Greek word cosmos.
[302.38 --> 304.88]  But specifically for us in our passage,
[305.62 --> 310.16]  this quote kind of captures the summary of what John means
[310.16 --> 312.38]  when he says, do not love the world.
[312.78 --> 315.88]  And this quote comes from the book that we've been reading
[315.88 --> 319.12]  for this sermon series from a pastor named John Mark Homer.
[319.56 --> 320.50]  And he writes this,
[320.90 --> 323.72]  So the biblical definition of the world here in this passage
[323.72 --> 327.82]  is a system of ideas, values, morals, practices,
[328.24 --> 331.82]  and social norms that are integrated into the mainstream
[331.82 --> 335.36]  and eventually institutionalized in a culture
[335.36 --> 339.76]  corrupted by the twin sins of rebellion against God
[339.76 --> 342.68]  and the redefinition of good and evil.
[342.68 --> 346.76]  So yeah, I'll let that sink in for a bit.
[347.42 --> 349.00]  Because I have to wrestle with this.
[349.18 --> 349.66]  I agree.
[350.02 --> 353.42]  This is what it means when John mentions the world,
[353.56 --> 355.28]  a normalized pattern of sin.
[356.02 --> 360.00]  In simpler ways, it is when a lot of sinful people,
[360.08 --> 361.12]  and we are all sinful,
[361.44 --> 363.82]  a lot of sinful broken people get together
[363.82 --> 366.88]  and we take our flesh,
[367.06 --> 368.14]  so our sinful natures,
[368.42 --> 369.92]  our disordered desires,
[370.46 --> 372.76]  come together and normalize it
[372.76 --> 374.78]  as if that's the norm.
[375.46 --> 378.64]  And it becomes what was wrong,
[378.78 --> 379.76]  biblically speaking,
[380.20 --> 383.02]  now becomes totally normal and acceptable,
[383.52 --> 384.40]  and further yet,
[384.62 --> 388.10]  it becomes the new standard of right or wrong,
[388.42 --> 390.46]  which is supposed to be in God's hands.
[390.46 --> 394.60]  It is to replace God with something else
[394.60 --> 396.74]  as the ultimate source of truth,
[397.10 --> 401.42]  further, as the ultimate source of life and happiness,
[401.64 --> 402.56]  as we have it.
[402.98 --> 404.92]  To replace God with something else
[404.92 --> 406.02]  to define that,
[406.36 --> 408.34]  life and happiness and truth.
[409.66 --> 413.34]  And so notice that when John writes this letter for us,
[413.66 --> 414.68]  for God's people,
[415.02 --> 416.08]  it's not an encouragement.
[416.08 --> 420.58]  This letter and this passage specifically is a command.
[421.40 --> 425.14]  Do not love the world or anything in it.
[425.80 --> 426.48]  It's a command.
[427.90 --> 428.90]  And so keep in mind,
[429.34 --> 430.62]  I invite you to keep in mind
[430.62 --> 433.16]  the definition of the world that we just discussed.
[433.90 --> 435.38]  Something that replaces God.
[436.18 --> 437.74]  Something that replaces Him
[437.74 --> 440.14]  as our ultimate source of happiness and truth.
[440.14 --> 442.46]  And we take it from His hands
[442.46 --> 445.38]  and we try to judge what is right or wrong
[445.38 --> 447.52]  instead of letting God do that.
[448.32 --> 449.38]  So that's the world.
[450.42 --> 451.56]  And then John says,
[451.70 --> 452.36]  don't love it.
[453.34 --> 454.70]  So I have to stop and think,
[454.80 --> 457.66]  what does John mean by loving the world?
[458.36 --> 459.06]  What do you mean,
[459.26 --> 460.34]  love the world?
[461.50 --> 464.32]  And the word that he specifically uses
[464.32 --> 466.40]  is the Greek agape love.
[466.96 --> 469.24]  It's not just any of the other loves.
[469.24 --> 469.94]  When he says,
[470.28 --> 471.60]  do not love the world,
[472.02 --> 472.46]  he says,
[472.58 --> 474.08]  do not agape the world.
[474.48 --> 475.30]  And ironically,
[475.96 --> 477.10]  this word agape
[477.10 --> 479.34]  is the word that's used
[479.34 --> 482.24]  to describe God's love for us.
[483.66 --> 485.72]  To describe God's
[485.72 --> 486.46]  total,
[487.00 --> 487.50]  holistic,
[487.94 --> 488.84]  agape love
[488.84 --> 489.96]  for His people.
[490.96 --> 492.86]  And what John is saying then is,
[493.28 --> 494.28]  don't agape,
[494.60 --> 496.64]  a total commitment
[496.64 --> 497.62]  commitment and loyalty
[497.62 --> 499.80]  to something or someone,
[500.04 --> 502.12]  don't do that to the world,
[502.46 --> 503.98]  is what John is telling us.
[505.28 --> 507.40]  Not just lovey-dovey feelings,
[508.04 --> 508.44]  but again,
[508.74 --> 509.28]  a total,
[509.74 --> 510.76]  holistic commitment
[510.76 --> 511.44]  and loyalty
[511.44 --> 512.66]  to someone or something.
[513.22 --> 513.62]  Therefore,
[514.10 --> 515.30]  if you then
[515.30 --> 515.88]  agape
[515.88 --> 516.76]  the world,
[517.56 --> 519.04]  there is no way
[519.04 --> 521.02]  for you to truly love God.
[521.02 --> 524.98]  John is simply stating fact
[524.98 --> 526.26]  and is informing us
[526.26 --> 527.06]  of what is.
[527.76 --> 528.82]  If you really
[528.82 --> 529.42]  holistically
[529.42 --> 531.46]  devote yourself
[531.46 --> 532.28]  to the world,
[532.82 --> 534.06]  you cannot have
[534.06 --> 535.30]  that same devotion
[535.30 --> 536.24]  to God.
[536.58 --> 537.72]  He's naming reality.
[538.10 --> 539.40]  Because the truth
[539.40 --> 540.28]  of the matter is,
[540.60 --> 542.32]  you cannot serve
[542.32 --> 543.40]  or love
[543.40 --> 544.74]  two masters.
[545.62 --> 546.74]  And this is exactly
[546.74 --> 547.64]  what Jesus says
[547.64 --> 548.60]  in Matthew 6.
[548.60 --> 551.06]  Jesus says,
[551.46 --> 552.80]  no one can serve
[552.80 --> 553.68]  two masters.
[554.26 --> 555.14]  Either you will
[555.14 --> 556.10]  hate the one
[556.10 --> 557.60]  and love.
[558.00 --> 558.58]  And it's the same
[558.58 --> 559.36]  Greek word here,
[559.48 --> 559.82]  agape.
[560.22 --> 560.82]  You will either
[560.82 --> 561.72]  hate the one
[561.72 --> 563.14]  or agape the other.
[564.28 --> 565.64]  Or you will be
[565.64 --> 566.88]  devoted to the one
[566.88 --> 568.46]  and despise the other.
[568.94 --> 570.24]  You cannot serve
[570.24 --> 571.28]  both God
[571.28 --> 572.12]  and money,
[572.44 --> 573.06]  Jesus says.
[574.22 --> 575.10]  And obviously here,
[575.16 --> 575.96]  Jesus is speaking
[575.96 --> 576.74]  specifically
[576.74 --> 578.00]  about money,
[578.30 --> 579.00]  which is another
[579.00 --> 580.12]  aspect of the world
[580.12 --> 580.80]  that we are called
[580.80 --> 581.92]  to fight and to resist.
[582.46 --> 583.60]  But what is interesting
[583.60 --> 584.34]  here is that
[584.34 --> 585.26]  Jesus uses
[585.26 --> 586.28]  that same word
[586.28 --> 587.40]  agape for love,
[587.56 --> 589.42]  but also equates
[589.42 --> 590.24]  that word,
[590.38 --> 591.02]  that love,
[591.16 --> 592.30]  with two verbs.
[593.00 --> 593.44]  Serving,
[593.98 --> 595.02]  you cannot serve
[595.02 --> 595.64]  two masters,
[595.98 --> 597.10]  and devoting.
[597.74 --> 598.56]  You will be either
[598.56 --> 599.76]  devoted to the one
[599.76 --> 601.18]  and despise the other.
[601.88 --> 602.88]  You cannot serve
[602.88 --> 604.40]  both money
[604.40 --> 605.08]  and God.
[606.42 --> 607.52]  And to continue
[607.52 --> 608.46]  our tradition here,
[608.82 --> 609.58]  I'm not going to steal
[609.58 --> 610.78]  too much from Dave's sermon,
[611.40 --> 612.96]  but from Ephesians 2,
[613.00 --> 613.22]  I mean,
[613.28 --> 614.00]  the other pastors
[614.00 --> 614.84]  steal a lot.
[615.20 --> 616.06]  I'm trying my best
[616.06 --> 617.46]  to break that pattern
[617.46 --> 617.96]  of sin,
[618.42 --> 619.44]  is what we're talking
[619.44 --> 619.92]  about here.
[622.00 --> 623.04]  I'm just quoting
[623.04 --> 623.96]  our theme passage,
[624.18 --> 625.36]  because the theme passage
[625.36 --> 626.88]  for our sermon series
[626.88 --> 628.22]  comes from Ephesians 2.
[628.50 --> 629.26]  And at the beginning
[629.26 --> 630.44]  of Ephesians 2,
[630.88 --> 631.80]  Paul writes this,
[631.80 --> 633.18]  that all of us
[633.18 --> 633.98]  were dead in our
[633.98 --> 634.72]  transgressions
[634.72 --> 635.42]  and our sins.
[636.82 --> 638.42]  And we used to live
[638.42 --> 639.48]  in the ways
[639.48 --> 640.18]  of this world.
[640.58 --> 641.68]  We used to live
[641.68 --> 642.38]  in this world
[642.38 --> 643.44]  and followed
[643.44 --> 644.32]  its patterns,
[644.44 --> 645.20]  is what Paul
[645.20 --> 645.98]  is telling us.
[646.22 --> 647.28]  In other words,
[647.72 --> 648.90]  that total
[648.90 --> 650.20]  holistic commitment
[650.20 --> 650.86]  and loyalty
[650.86 --> 651.68]  to something,
[652.64 --> 653.60]  that was us,
[653.70 --> 654.44]  all of us,
[654.68 --> 655.82]  when we used to live
[655.82 --> 657.32]  according to the ways
[657.32 --> 657.92]  of this world.
[657.92 --> 660.30]  we used to love
[660.30 --> 661.88]  agape the world.
[663.64 --> 664.50]  That's what our
[664.50 --> 665.14]  biblical writers
[665.14 --> 665.88]  are telling us.
[666.96 --> 668.56]  We used to serve
[668.56 --> 669.14]  the world,
[669.24 --> 670.28]  to use Jesus' words.
[670.54 --> 671.48]  We used to serve
[671.48 --> 672.42]  the world that stands
[672.42 --> 673.82]  in rebellion against God.
[674.08 --> 675.44]  We used to be devoted
[675.44 --> 676.10]  to the world,
[676.20 --> 677.58]  which is Satan's domain,
[678.20 --> 679.46]  seeking full autonomy
[679.46 --> 680.36]  from its maker,
[680.84 --> 681.90]  judging for ourselves
[681.90 --> 682.96]  what is right and wrong.
[684.30 --> 686.08]  This is the exact same way
[686.08 --> 687.68]  Satan tempts Eve
[687.68 --> 688.22]  in the garden,
[688.34 --> 688.74]  isn't it?
[689.54 --> 690.28]  He says,
[691.02 --> 692.02]  don't listen to God.
[692.38 --> 693.80]  You will surely not die
[693.80 --> 694.72]  when you eat of this fruit,
[694.88 --> 696.02]  but you shall live
[696.02 --> 697.14]  and you shall have
[697.14 --> 698.10]  your eyes open
[698.10 --> 699.88]  and you will be
[699.88 --> 701.56]  like God.
[702.36 --> 703.48]  Putting ourselves
[703.48 --> 704.72]  on the same level
[704.72 --> 705.18]  as God.
[705.28 --> 706.08]  That's the temptation.
[706.34 --> 707.16]  That's the lie.
[707.98 --> 708.96]  And that's what Satan's saying.
[709.18 --> 710.94]  You shall be like God.
[711.00 --> 712.14]  And then what's the end here?
[712.86 --> 715.52]  Knowing good and evil.
[716.58 --> 718.06]  Taking that right judgment
[718.06 --> 719.02]  away from God
[719.02 --> 719.74]  and saying,
[720.12 --> 720.80]  we know better.
[721.34 --> 721.70]  God,
[721.94 --> 723.30]  I know better than you.
[723.62 --> 724.46]  I know what's right.
[724.64 --> 725.42]  I know what's wrong.
[725.68 --> 726.64]  I am the master
[726.64 --> 727.72]  of my own life.
[728.48 --> 730.00]  That is the lie
[730.00 --> 731.36]  that we are tempted with.
[732.52 --> 733.28]  And so here,
[733.44 --> 734.62]  even in our passage,
[736.02 --> 737.46]  what John is telling us,
[737.88 --> 739.50]  what John is describing for us
[739.50 --> 741.54]  is that same old human story,
[741.84 --> 743.06]  that same old struggle
[743.06 --> 744.30]  against our flesh,
[744.58 --> 745.54]  our sinful natures.
[745.54 --> 747.14]  And then he goes further
[747.14 --> 747.94]  in our passage
[747.94 --> 750.14]  and he names the three roots
[750.14 --> 752.18]  of what we used to belong to.
[752.60 --> 753.98]  When we used to love
[753.98 --> 754.92]  and follow the ways
[754.92 --> 755.60]  of this world,
[756.36 --> 758.34]  this world is rooted
[758.34 --> 760.04]  in these three things.
[760.20 --> 761.46]  The lust of the flesh,
[761.76 --> 762.98]  the lust of the eyes,
[763.04 --> 764.32]  and the pride of life.
[765.28 --> 766.24]  The love of the world,
[766.34 --> 767.50]  the ways of this world,
[768.04 --> 769.38]  it's rooted in these
[769.38 --> 770.36]  perverted things.
[770.88 --> 772.86]  Because it's so significant here
[772.86 --> 774.68]  that John specifically
[774.68 --> 776.26]  uses the word lust
[776.26 --> 778.56]  to describe these roots
[778.56 --> 779.82]  of sin and evil.
[780.46 --> 782.68]  Because lust is the perversion
[782.68 --> 783.56]  of love,
[783.76 --> 784.72]  of true love.
[784.98 --> 786.38]  And so he's taking that agape
[786.38 --> 787.30]  and he's saying,
[787.52 --> 788.66]  if you agape the world
[788.66 --> 790.10]  and you're totally committed
[790.10 --> 791.54]  to the ways of this world,
[791.92 --> 795.16]  do you know what you're belonging to?
[795.72 --> 796.70]  Do you know what the roots
[796.70 --> 797.64]  of the world are?
[798.32 --> 798.86]  He's saying,
[799.24 --> 801.00]  it's the disordered desires
[801.00 --> 802.92]  of our flesh,
[803.10 --> 803.84]  of our eyes,
[803.92 --> 804.74]  and the pride
[804.74 --> 806.90]  that stands against God.
[809.02 --> 810.54]  And many times in the church,
[810.62 --> 811.72]  when we use the word,
[811.82 --> 813.50]  or when we refer to the word lust,
[814.10 --> 815.72]  we usually just tie it together
[815.72 --> 816.66]  with sexual sins,
[816.80 --> 817.80]  sexual temptations.
[818.34 --> 819.78]  But it's not just simply
[819.78 --> 820.88]  sexual sins.
[821.70 --> 822.96]  It's talking about
[822.96 --> 824.54]  anything that goes beyond
[824.54 --> 826.16]  appreciation and enjoyment
[826.16 --> 827.64]  of God's good gifts
[827.64 --> 828.38]  of creation.
[828.76 --> 830.20]  Anything that goes beyond
[830.20 --> 831.76]  God's standard
[831.76 --> 832.62]  of right or wrong.
[832.92 --> 833.74]  Taking that away
[833.74 --> 834.74]  from God and saying,
[834.86 --> 835.04]  no,
[835.34 --> 836.12]  I know better.
[837.30 --> 839.22]  It's our disordered desires
[839.22 --> 840.92]  that enslave and trap us
[840.92 --> 842.02]  in our addictions
[842.02 --> 843.88]  as we follow our lusts.
[844.82 --> 846.38]  Whether it be our lusts
[846.38 --> 847.46]  for total autonomy
[847.46 --> 848.50]  that we've been talking about.
[848.80 --> 849.78]  Whether it be our lusts
[849.78 --> 850.30]  for greed,
[850.60 --> 851.16]  for power,
[851.28 --> 851.88]  for control,
[852.28 --> 853.84]  for domination over others.
[854.28 --> 855.86]  Or our disordered desires
[855.86 --> 857.58]  for instant gratification
[857.58 --> 858.76]  instead of commitment
[858.76 --> 860.14]  and covenant loyalty
[860.14 --> 860.96]  in friendships,
[861.42 --> 862.10]  in families,
[862.32 --> 863.04]  in marriages.
[865.42 --> 866.72]  That's the world
[866.72 --> 868.64]  that we used to live in.
[868.84 --> 869.70]  That's the world
[869.70 --> 870.72]  that we used to follow
[870.72 --> 871.52]  and agape.
[872.46 --> 873.44]  That's what John
[873.44 --> 874.22]  and Paul
[874.22 --> 875.08]  is writing about.
[876.46 --> 877.96]  And then the third root
[877.96 --> 878.80]  of this world,
[879.12 --> 879.74]  John says,
[880.10 --> 881.82]  is the pride of life.
[883.34 --> 884.86]  The pride of life
[884.86 --> 885.76]  speaking into
[885.76 --> 886.84]  our human condition
[886.84 --> 888.28]  where we rebel
[888.28 --> 889.38]  against all authority
[889.38 --> 890.06]  and we think
[890.06 --> 890.78]  we know better
[890.78 --> 892.54]  than any of our forbearers
[892.54 --> 893.72]  or anyone around us
[893.72 --> 894.92]  including God himself.
[894.92 --> 896.94]  And we live into the lie
[896.94 --> 898.08]  of who are you
[898.08 --> 898.90]  to tell me?
[900.70 --> 901.74]  Pastor Sid mentioned
[901.74 --> 902.94]  these lies as well.
[903.10 --> 903.90]  Our cultural lies
[903.90 --> 904.56]  that we live into
[904.56 --> 905.46]  a couple weeks ago
[905.46 --> 906.96]  where we say,
[907.82 --> 908.46]  you do you.
[909.62 --> 910.22]  It's okay.
[910.74 --> 911.86]  Just follow your heart.
[911.96 --> 912.88]  Doesn't matter who
[912.88 --> 913.58]  or whatever
[913.58 --> 914.92]  comes out your way.
[915.06 --> 916.62]  Just follow your heart
[916.62 --> 917.98]  as if our hearts
[917.98 --> 918.54]  are pure.
[920.62 --> 922.04]  Those are the lies
[922.04 --> 924.18]  that are rooted
[924.18 --> 924.98]  in the world.
[926.12 --> 926.54]  And then,
[926.72 --> 927.44]  same author,
[927.60 --> 928.26]  John Mark Homer
[928.26 --> 928.84]  and his book
[928.84 --> 929.94]  makes an interesting
[929.94 --> 930.44]  connection.
[930.82 --> 931.74]  It was interesting to me
[931.74 --> 932.98]  because I was the one
[932.98 --> 933.78]  who preached on
[933.78 --> 934.90]  Jesus' temptations
[934.90 --> 935.84]  in the wilderness
[935.84 --> 937.12]  a few weeks ago.
[937.90 --> 938.80]  And then John Mark Homer,
[938.90 --> 939.30]  this writer,
[939.42 --> 940.46]  connects these three
[940.46 --> 941.80]  roots of the world
[941.80 --> 942.92]  to the temptations
[942.92 --> 943.90]  that Jesus faced.
[944.60 --> 945.12]  Specifically,
[945.98 --> 947.24]  the lust of the flesh
[947.24 --> 948.32]  when Satan said,
[948.54 --> 949.02]  you're hungry,
[949.50 --> 950.86]  you fasted for 40 days,
[951.14 --> 952.10]  now make these stones
[952.10 --> 952.60]  into bread,
[952.96 --> 954.34]  satisfy your flesh,
[954.44 --> 954.96]  your hunger.
[955.90 --> 957.50]  The lust of the eyes
[957.50 --> 958.62]  where Satan shows
[958.62 --> 959.74]  Jesus the splendor
[959.74 --> 960.26]  of the kingdoms
[960.26 --> 961.00]  of this world
[961.00 --> 961.82]  and said,
[962.04 --> 962.76]  bow down to me
[962.76 --> 963.74]  and I'll give it to you.
[965.16 --> 966.50]  The pride of life,
[966.98 --> 967.18]  saying,
[967.32 --> 967.92]  tempting Jesus
[967.92 --> 968.84]  to jump off
[968.84 --> 970.36]  the top of the temple
[970.36 --> 970.90]  and saying,
[971.80 --> 972.20]  you know,
[972.44 --> 973.22]  you're the son of God,
[973.30 --> 973.92]  you'll be protected,
[974.08 --> 974.64]  jump off.
[975.60 --> 976.62]  Test God's willingness
[976.62 --> 977.60]  to protect you,
[978.10 --> 979.76]  to speak against
[979.76 --> 981.18]  God's will
[981.18 --> 982.74]  and to challenge
[982.74 --> 984.08]  God's authority
[984.08 --> 985.76]  by testing Jesus'
[986.04 --> 987.06]  identity himself.
[987.80 --> 989.06]  So just as
[989.06 --> 990.04]  Jesus was tempted,
[990.04 --> 992.20]  it's the same
[992.20 --> 992.84]  for us.
[993.74 --> 994.88]  We are also
[994.88 --> 995.34]  tempted
[995.34 --> 996.48]  and attacked
[996.48 --> 997.30]  by the enemy
[997.30 --> 999.12]  and further yet
[999.12 --> 1000.12]  within ourselves
[1000.12 --> 1001.02]  are sinful natures
[1001.02 --> 1002.42]  and the world
[1002.42 --> 1003.50]  that normalizes
[1003.50 --> 1004.30]  these things.
[1006.30 --> 1007.46]  So at this point
[1007.46 --> 1008.42]  we make full circle
[1008.42 --> 1009.10]  and we come back
[1009.10 --> 1009.58]  to the question
[1009.58 --> 1010.34]  I started with.
[1010.70 --> 1011.78]  So what sin then,
[1012.08 --> 1012.82]  what patterns
[1012.82 --> 1013.78]  of brokenness
[1013.78 --> 1015.10]  are normalized
[1015.10 --> 1016.46]  in our world today?
[1016.46 --> 1018.44]  And maybe
[1018.44 --> 1019.18]  more importantly,
[1019.42 --> 1020.26]  are we aware
[1020.26 --> 1021.26]  of those normalized
[1021.26 --> 1021.82]  sins?
[1023.52 --> 1024.60]  Then to get a little
[1024.60 --> 1025.26]  deeper here,
[1025.64 --> 1026.60]  this is what the tissues
[1026.60 --> 1027.12]  were for
[1027.12 --> 1029.44]  from last service.
[1029.78 --> 1030.40]  I'll try to keep
[1030.40 --> 1031.04]  myself together.
[1032.20 --> 1033.08]  Are we aware
[1033.08 --> 1034.18]  of the normalized
[1034.18 --> 1035.50]  North American culture
[1035.50 --> 1037.60]  of hyper-individualism
[1037.60 --> 1038.72]  that even seep
[1038.72 --> 1040.10]  into our own church here?
[1040.10 --> 1042.18]  where giving up
[1042.18 --> 1043.20]  one's own time
[1043.20 --> 1043.70]  and energy
[1043.70 --> 1044.94]  to serve one another
[1044.94 --> 1046.14]  is a relatively
[1046.14 --> 1047.20]  huge burden.
[1047.84 --> 1048.58]  Why is that?
[1048.68 --> 1049.50]  I've felt that.
[1050.84 --> 1052.10]  Are we aware
[1052.10 --> 1052.76]  that money
[1052.76 --> 1054.20]  is always a temptation
[1054.20 --> 1055.08]  that we will face?
[1055.64 --> 1056.56]  Where we sometimes
[1056.56 --> 1057.64]  fall to the trap
[1057.64 --> 1058.28]  of believing
[1058.28 --> 1059.46]  that money
[1059.46 --> 1060.94]  solves everything?
[1061.82 --> 1063.20]  Or where money
[1063.20 --> 1064.12]  is even more
[1064.12 --> 1064.80]  valuable
[1064.80 --> 1066.18]  than human lives?
[1066.18 --> 1070.06]  Are we aware
[1070.06 --> 1071.16]  that not only
[1071.16 --> 1072.54]  do we normalize
[1072.54 --> 1074.02]  our hyper-sexualized
[1074.02 --> 1074.46]  culture,
[1074.90 --> 1076.34]  we even celebrate it
[1076.34 --> 1077.30]  as evident
[1077.30 --> 1078.52]  in our social media
[1078.52 --> 1079.60]  or popular media
[1079.60 --> 1081.32]  and the movies
[1081.32 --> 1082.36]  that are popularized?
[1084.52 --> 1085.00]  And then,
[1085.42 --> 1086.34]  this may be a bit
[1086.34 --> 1087.42]  irrelevant to us
[1087.42 --> 1088.30]  here in North America,
[1088.74 --> 1089.62]  are we aware
[1089.62 --> 1091.00]  of how some countries
[1091.00 --> 1091.84]  normalize
[1091.84 --> 1092.60]  the abortions
[1092.60 --> 1093.20]  of babies
[1093.20 --> 1094.24]  with confirmed
[1094.24 --> 1094.98]  Down syndrome
[1094.98 --> 1095.60]  in the womb?
[1095.60 --> 1096.92]  And it's just normal
[1096.92 --> 1097.82]  to just get rid
[1097.82 --> 1098.36]  of your baby
[1098.36 --> 1099.60]  when you can prove
[1099.60 --> 1100.26]  scientifically
[1100.26 --> 1101.30]  that your baby
[1101.30 --> 1102.20]  has Down syndrome.
[1102.88 --> 1103.58]  Oh, okay,
[1103.90 --> 1105.62]  that's the final okay,
[1105.82 --> 1106.84]  confirmation that I can
[1106.84 --> 1107.74]  get rid of this baby.
[1108.66 --> 1110.02]  And that's daunting.
[1110.40 --> 1111.28]  It's normalized
[1111.28 --> 1112.60]  in certain countries
[1112.60 --> 1113.60]  that we live in.
[1115.04 --> 1115.72]  Oh, Christianity
[1115.72 --> 1116.72]  doesn't exist
[1116.72 --> 1117.34]  in those countries
[1117.34 --> 1117.82]  probably.
[1118.10 --> 1118.40]  No.
[1119.56 --> 1120.06]  No.
[1121.24 --> 1122.46]  Christians do exist
[1122.46 --> 1123.28]  in those countries,
[1123.46 --> 1125.02]  but it's still normalized.
[1125.60 --> 1126.64]  To get rid of babies
[1126.64 --> 1127.62]  that are not wanted.
[1133.72 --> 1134.84]  And what does Scripture
[1134.84 --> 1135.48]  tell us
[1135.48 --> 1136.06]  in the face
[1136.06 --> 1137.42]  of this daunting battle?
[1140.10 --> 1141.34]  Along with John,
[1142.00 --> 1143.00]  Paul says in Romans,
[1143.12 --> 1143.94]  the famous verse,
[1143.94 --> 1145.98]  Do not be conformed
[1145.98 --> 1146.66]  to the patterns
[1146.66 --> 1147.44]  of this world,
[1148.16 --> 1149.38]  but be transformed
[1149.38 --> 1150.42]  by the renewing
[1150.42 --> 1151.08]  of your mind.
[1151.84 --> 1152.20]  Then,
[1152.44 --> 1153.62]  and here's the important part,
[1153.88 --> 1155.00]  then you will be able
[1155.00 --> 1155.62]  to test
[1155.62 --> 1156.60]  and approve
[1156.60 --> 1157.20]  what
[1157.20 --> 1159.32]  God's will is,
[1159.40 --> 1160.42]  not ours.
[1161.84 --> 1162.72]  God's will.
[1163.88 --> 1164.52]  His good,
[1164.94 --> 1165.30]  pleasing,
[1165.50 --> 1166.92]  and perfect will.
[1166.92 --> 1167.92]  God's will.
[1167.92 --> 1167.96]  God's will.
[1167.96 --> 1168.24]  God's will.
[1168.24 --> 1168.92]  God's will.
[1168.92 --> 1168.94]  God's will.
[1168.94 --> 1171.96]  That's what we stand for.
[1172.50 --> 1173.88]  We belong to God
[1173.88 --> 1175.24]  because we,
[1175.46 --> 1176.34]  as God's people,
[1176.80 --> 1178.04]  we are a people
[1178.04 --> 1179.56]  that have been transformed
[1179.56 --> 1180.78]  by the renewing
[1180.78 --> 1181.68]  of our minds,
[1181.96 --> 1183.90]  by the Holy Spirit,
[1184.02 --> 1185.02]  by the work of the cross
[1185.02 --> 1185.74]  and the resurrection.
[1186.26 --> 1187.72]  We have been transformed
[1187.72 --> 1188.56]  by the renewing
[1188.56 --> 1189.18]  of our minds.
[1189.38 --> 1190.06]  And we stand
[1190.06 --> 1190.96]  against the world
[1190.96 --> 1192.00]  and we no longer
[1192.00 --> 1192.98]  love the world,
[1193.10 --> 1194.50]  but we love God.
[1194.50 --> 1197.08]  we totally agape
[1197.08 --> 1198.28]  our maker,
[1198.76 --> 1199.68]  not the ways
[1199.68 --> 1200.30]  of this world.
[1200.54 --> 1201.58]  Or at least
[1201.58 --> 1203.58]  that's what our desire is
[1203.58 --> 1205.16]  as transformed people.
[1206.80 --> 1207.84]  But name the reality.
[1208.34 --> 1209.40]  That's not as easy
[1209.40 --> 1210.14]  as we say,
[1210.22 --> 1210.58]  is it?
[1212.38 --> 1213.98]  We desperately
[1213.98 --> 1215.06]  and continually
[1215.06 --> 1216.70]  need God's Spirit
[1216.70 --> 1218.12]  to guide and help us
[1218.12 --> 1219.18]  as we continue
[1219.18 --> 1219.90]  to wrestle
[1219.90 --> 1221.68]  against our normalized sins
[1221.68 --> 1222.74]  in our culture.
[1223.58 --> 1224.04]  And so,
[1224.50 --> 1224.92]  we,
[1225.18 --> 1225.72]  as a church,
[1225.78 --> 1226.66]  as God's people,
[1227.00 --> 1228.10]  are we a community
[1228.10 --> 1229.20]  that seeks healing
[1229.20 --> 1230.06]  and wholeness
[1230.06 --> 1231.48]  to live the life
[1231.48 --> 1232.56]  worthy of the calling
[1232.56 --> 1234.22]  that we have been gifted by?
[1236.36 --> 1237.58]  Are we a community
[1237.58 --> 1239.16]  that seeks God's will,
[1239.60 --> 1240.78]  not our own?
[1243.48 --> 1243.98]  And so,
[1244.10 --> 1245.04]  John echoes this
[1245.04 --> 1246.60]  in his letter
[1246.60 --> 1247.56]  for us this morning.
[1248.18 --> 1248.74]  At the end
[1248.74 --> 1249.74]  of this little passage,
[1250.08 --> 1250.66]  we read
[1250.66 --> 1251.78]  that the world,
[1251.94 --> 1253.60]  the world
[1253.60 --> 1254.78]  and its desires,
[1254.94 --> 1255.58]  the disordered,
[1255.74 --> 1256.70]  perverted desires,
[1257.22 --> 1258.06]  they pass away.
[1259.08 --> 1261.04]  And a lot of commentators
[1261.04 --> 1262.00]  say the better translation
[1262.00 --> 1263.08]  is it's actually
[1263.08 --> 1264.00]  continual action.
[1264.42 --> 1264.94]  The world
[1264.94 --> 1265.92]  and its desires
[1265.92 --> 1267.22]  are passing away.
[1267.44 --> 1268.44]  They are continually
[1268.44 --> 1269.30]  passing away.
[1269.72 --> 1270.94]  They do not last.
[1271.22 --> 1272.54]  They do not satisfy
[1272.54 --> 1273.70]  the deep longings
[1273.70 --> 1275.16]  that we all have
[1275.16 --> 1276.30]  for happiness
[1276.30 --> 1277.06]  and joy
[1277.06 --> 1278.24]  that can only
[1278.24 --> 1279.34]  come from God.
[1279.34 --> 1280.44]  And that's what John
[1280.44 --> 1281.18]  is talking about.
[1281.42 --> 1282.48]  All these things
[1282.48 --> 1283.06]  of this world
[1283.06 --> 1283.94]  pass away.
[1284.30 --> 1285.12]  They don't last
[1285.12 --> 1286.12]  and they don't satisfy.
[1286.48 --> 1287.52]  But you know what does?
[1288.94 --> 1290.40]  Doing God's will.
[1291.70 --> 1292.94]  Doing God's will.
[1293.02 --> 1293.64]  Whoever does
[1293.64 --> 1294.90]  the will of God
[1294.90 --> 1296.58]  will live forever.
[1298.10 --> 1299.48]  God satisfies.
[1300.10 --> 1301.22]  God can fill
[1301.22 --> 1302.36]  our deep longings
[1302.36 --> 1303.20]  for that happiness
[1303.20 --> 1304.26]  and that shalom,
[1304.42 --> 1305.20]  that restoration
[1305.20 --> 1306.56]  because we all know
[1306.56 --> 1308.38]  that we are broken,
[1308.38 --> 1309.50]  that the world
[1309.50 --> 1310.22]  is broken
[1310.22 --> 1312.42]  and only God
[1312.42 --> 1313.40]  is the answer.
[1315.42 --> 1316.20]  Whoever does
[1316.20 --> 1317.88]  the will of God,
[1319.42 --> 1320.42]  God's good,
[1320.84 --> 1321.22]  pleasing,
[1321.48 --> 1322.46]  and perfect will.
[1323.90 --> 1324.60]  Fair to ask,
[1324.68 --> 1325.10]  what is that?
[1325.80 --> 1326.94]  What is God's will then?
[1328.20 --> 1329.76]  To love Him,
[1330.74 --> 1331.72]  not the world.
[1332.36 --> 1333.44]  To love Him
[1333.44 --> 1334.92]  because He first
[1334.92 --> 1335.90]  loved us.
[1335.90 --> 1337.32]  and then we get
[1337.32 --> 1338.38]  to the beautiful image
[1338.38 --> 1340.00]  that we are broken cups
[1340.00 --> 1341.18]  put back together
[1341.18 --> 1342.96]  and we are loved
[1342.96 --> 1343.60]  by God
[1343.60 --> 1344.50]  and this cup
[1344.50 --> 1346.28]  then now overflows.
[1347.64 --> 1349.14]  It overflows
[1349.14 --> 1350.22]  onto the world
[1350.22 --> 1351.30]  as a witness.
[1352.58 --> 1353.90]  As we witness
[1353.90 --> 1354.84]  and we continue
[1354.84 --> 1355.64]  to live out
[1355.64 --> 1356.56]  our identity
[1356.56 --> 1357.48]  as loved
[1357.48 --> 1358.30]  by our maker.
[1359.04 --> 1359.76]  And this love
[1359.76 --> 1360.50]  overflows
[1360.50 --> 1361.76]  and we get
[1361.76 --> 1362.32]  to bless
[1362.32 --> 1363.22]  those around us
[1363.22 --> 1364.30]  with this love.
[1368.26 --> 1369.38]  That's our identity
[1369.38 --> 1370.14]  and calling hope.
[1370.52 --> 1371.48]  And this image
[1371.48 --> 1372.10]  is captured
[1372.10 --> 1372.78]  so beautifully
[1372.78 --> 1373.46]  in the phrase.
[1373.82 --> 1374.52]  I believe this is
[1374.52 --> 1375.04]  what our youth
[1375.04 --> 1375.80]  is doing right now
[1375.80 --> 1376.76]  in this season as well.
[1377.30 --> 1377.80]  We are
[1377.80 --> 1379.18]  in the world
[1379.18 --> 1381.48]  not of the world.
[1382.00 --> 1382.68]  Very simple,
[1382.80 --> 1383.30]  very catchy.
[1383.76 --> 1384.98]  Simple truth
[1384.98 --> 1386.10]  of our identity.
[1386.48 --> 1387.46]  We are in the world.
[1387.56 --> 1388.68]  We're definitely in it.
[1388.68 --> 1390.42]  The banners show us
[1390.42 --> 1391.36]  we are in it
[1391.36 --> 1392.06]  and we're struggling
[1392.06 --> 1392.76]  against it.
[1393.60 --> 1395.28]  But the important part is
[1395.28 --> 1396.84]  we are not of it.
[1396.94 --> 1398.30]  We do not belong to it.
[1398.50 --> 1399.66]  And we are in it
[1399.66 --> 1401.58]  for its restoration.
[1402.32 --> 1403.56]  We are in the world
[1403.56 --> 1405.20]  to reflect God's love
[1405.20 --> 1406.12]  for the world.
[1410.00 --> 1411.58]  We belong to God
[1411.58 --> 1412.86]  and in His love
[1412.86 --> 1413.98]  we are called to be
[1413.98 --> 1414.58]  again
[1414.58 --> 1416.22]  for the world's
[1416.22 --> 1417.18]  blessing and restoration.
[1417.90 --> 1418.62]  We are called to be
[1418.62 --> 1419.02]  a witness
[1419.02 --> 1420.12]  to the love of God
[1420.12 --> 1421.06]  our maker
[1421.06 --> 1421.72]  and redeemer
[1421.72 --> 1423.00]  because He is
[1423.00 --> 1423.80]  the true source
[1423.80 --> 1424.74]  of happiness
[1424.74 --> 1425.62]  and wholeness
[1425.62 --> 1426.94]  not the world
[1426.94 --> 1428.10]  or anything in it.
[1429.90 --> 1430.30]  And so
[1430.30 --> 1432.28]  to land the plane here
[1432.28 --> 1434.22]  how do we live
[1434.22 --> 1434.92]  in the world
[1434.92 --> 1436.58]  for the world
[1436.58 --> 1437.80]  but not of it?
[1438.80 --> 1440.00]  How do you do that
[1440.00 --> 1440.94]  practically speaking
[1440.94 --> 1442.56]  as God's people
[1442.56 --> 1443.90]  who share in this identity?
[1443.90 --> 1446.18]  it's again
[1446.18 --> 1447.30]  the Sunday school answer
[1447.30 --> 1448.50]  Jesus.
[1449.18 --> 1450.16]  We do it
[1450.16 --> 1451.32]  by the power
[1451.32 --> 1452.22]  of the resurrection.
[1453.78 --> 1455.02]  Next week for Easter
[1455.02 --> 1455.70]  that's what we get
[1455.70 --> 1456.48]  to reflect on.
[1457.34 --> 1458.48]  That He is risen.
[1459.74 --> 1460.76]  That He is
[1460.76 --> 1461.88]  more powerful
[1461.88 --> 1463.12]  than any struggle
[1463.12 --> 1464.04]  that we can face.
[1464.90 --> 1466.48]  He is our foundation.
[1467.00 --> 1468.36]  Because as I mentioned
[1468.36 --> 1468.76]  before
[1468.76 --> 1469.80]  Jesus faced
[1469.80 --> 1470.78]  the same temptations
[1470.78 --> 1471.56]  that we face
[1471.56 --> 1472.18]  from the enemy
[1472.18 --> 1473.68]  and from the world
[1473.68 --> 1475.02]  and in the same way
[1475.02 --> 1475.72]  we can overcome
[1475.72 --> 1476.44]  and resist
[1476.44 --> 1477.40]  the patterns
[1477.40 --> 1478.20]  of this world
[1478.20 --> 1480.02]  won by the victory
[1480.02 --> 1480.84]  on the cross.
[1482.10 --> 1482.84]  It is not
[1482.84 --> 1483.98]  by our own strength
[1483.98 --> 1484.78]  but by the one
[1484.78 --> 1486.08]  who lives in me.
[1486.70 --> 1487.94]  And that's the good news
[1487.94 --> 1489.04]  because man
[1489.04 --> 1489.68]  is it hard
[1489.68 --> 1490.36]  to not
[1490.36 --> 1491.48]  love the world.
[1491.48 --> 1495.42]  Satan's lies
[1495.42 --> 1496.10]  and deceptions
[1496.10 --> 1498.18]  my own sinful nature
[1498.18 --> 1499.14]  waging war
[1499.14 --> 1499.74]  within me
[1499.74 --> 1500.94]  and then the world
[1500.94 --> 1501.60]  telling me
[1501.60 --> 1502.96]  that this sinful nature
[1502.96 --> 1503.96]  is normal
[1503.96 --> 1504.72]  and sometimes
[1504.72 --> 1505.52]  even good.
[1506.86 --> 1508.76]  It's so deceptive.
[1510.20 --> 1511.94]  It's a daunting fight
[1511.94 --> 1512.90]  that we face.
[1515.58 --> 1517.02]  But the good news
[1517.02 --> 1518.14]  is that our fight
[1518.14 --> 1518.70]  is won
[1518.70 --> 1520.16]  through our Lord
[1520.16 --> 1521.06]  Jesus Christ.
[1521.48 --> 1521.92]  Again,
[1522.04 --> 1523.60]  not by our own strength
[1523.60 --> 1524.42]  because Jesus
[1524.42 --> 1525.60]  took all this
[1525.60 --> 1526.40]  brokenness,
[1526.56 --> 1527.34]  all of it
[1527.34 --> 1528.66]  against Satan
[1528.66 --> 1530.76]  because of our sins,
[1531.00 --> 1531.56]  because of the
[1531.56 --> 1532.46]  brokenness of the world.
[1532.56 --> 1533.14]  He put it on
[1533.14 --> 1534.58]  his own shoulders,
[1534.92 --> 1536.32]  gave up his own life
[1536.32 --> 1537.20]  so that we
[1537.20 --> 1538.44]  may have life
[1538.44 --> 1539.18]  because
[1539.18 --> 1540.70]  for the wages
[1540.70 --> 1541.32]  of sin
[1541.32 --> 1542.06]  is death
[1542.06 --> 1544.40]  but the gift
[1544.40 --> 1545.02]  of God
[1545.02 --> 1546.24]  is eternal life
[1546.24 --> 1547.02]  in Christ Jesus
[1547.02 --> 1547.62]  our Lord.
[1547.86 --> 1548.56]  That's what
[1548.56 --> 1549.80]  we live in.
[1550.38 --> 1551.36]  That's the hope
[1551.36 --> 1552.42]  that is our
[1552.42 --> 1553.28]  foundation.
[1553.68 --> 1554.64]  We don't live
[1554.64 --> 1556.06]  to love the world.
[1556.44 --> 1557.32]  We belong
[1557.32 --> 1558.00]  to God.
[1558.86 --> 1559.56]  All praise
[1559.56 --> 1560.14]  to him
[1560.14 --> 1561.66]  who loves us
[1561.66 --> 1562.24]  to life.
[1562.74 --> 1563.28]  We live
[1563.28 --> 1564.68]  in this gospel story.
[1565.26 --> 1566.40]  That is our identity
[1566.40 --> 1567.26]  and calling hope.
[1567.92 --> 1568.48]  Be blessed,
[1568.62 --> 1569.34]  be encouraged.
[1569.84 --> 1570.38]  You belong
[1570.38 --> 1571.20]  to our maker
[1571.20 --> 1572.28]  and our redeemer.
[1573.28 --> 1573.88]  Amen.
[1574.24 --> 1574.82]  Let's pray.
[1574.82 --> 1574.92]  Lord.
[1581.88 --> 1583.00]  Loving Father,
[1584.00 --> 1586.58]  we come before you
[1586.58 --> 1588.16]  in humility
[1588.16 --> 1589.06]  and gratitude
[1589.06 --> 1592.50]  because what can we boast,
[1592.70 --> 1592.82]  Lord?
[1593.82 --> 1595.38]  What have we done
[1595.38 --> 1596.22]  and accomplished
[1596.22 --> 1598.84]  against the enemy,
[1600.32 --> 1601.42]  against the world,
[1602.32 --> 1603.18]  against ourselves?
[1603.18 --> 1605.86]  what sin
[1605.86 --> 1607.02]  have we beaten
[1607.02 --> 1609.10]  and overcome
[1609.10 --> 1610.38]  by our own strength?
[1612.70 --> 1613.30]  Lord,
[1613.36 --> 1614.36]  we depend on you
[1614.36 --> 1616.36]  and we confess
[1616.36 --> 1617.00]  before you
[1617.00 --> 1617.98]  that we live
[1617.98 --> 1620.20]  not by our own strength
[1620.20 --> 1622.40]  but by your love,
[1622.98 --> 1624.20]  by your presence
[1624.20 --> 1625.14]  living in us.
[1626.14 --> 1627.18]  We thank you
[1627.18 --> 1627.76]  for this
[1627.76 --> 1629.18]  good news.
[1629.18 --> 1630.58]  we thank you
[1630.58 --> 1631.48]  for this hope
[1631.48 --> 1632.64]  that we get to have
[1632.64 --> 1634.32]  in you,
[1634.80 --> 1635.54]  not ourselves.
[1636.22 --> 1637.70]  May we be a church.
[1638.04 --> 1639.26]  May we be a people
[1639.26 --> 1641.46]  who seek your will,
[1641.96 --> 1642.50]  your good,
[1642.62 --> 1642.98]  pleasing,
[1643.30 --> 1643.92]  perfect will,
[1644.20 --> 1645.42]  not our own.
[1645.90 --> 1646.84]  May we name
[1646.84 --> 1648.56]  our own realities.
[1648.90 --> 1650.26]  May we name
[1650.26 --> 1652.38]  the normalized sins
[1652.38 --> 1653.76]  of our world
[1653.76 --> 1654.60]  and our culture
[1654.60 --> 1655.24]  around us
[1655.24 --> 1656.10]  and may we
[1656.10 --> 1657.74]  stand and resist
[1657.74 --> 1658.86]  as witnesses
[1658.86 --> 1659.90]  to your kingdom,
[1660.32 --> 1661.50]  to your love.
[1663.14 --> 1664.04]  We thank you
[1664.04 --> 1665.10]  for your,
[1665.22 --> 1666.72]  your goodness
[1666.72 --> 1667.42]  and your love
[1667.42 --> 1667.94]  for us.
[1669.24 --> 1669.68]  Lord,
[1669.72 --> 1670.12]  we give you
[1670.12 --> 1670.78]  all the glory.
[1671.10 --> 1671.72]  In Jesus' name
[1671.72 --> 1672.14]  we pray.
[1673.16 --> 1673.50]  Amen.
[1675.22 --> 1676.08]  I invite you
[1676.08 --> 1676.60]  to stand
[1676.60 --> 1677.38]  as we sing
[1677.38 --> 1678.76]  Yet Not I
[1678.76 --> 1679.82]  But Christ
[1679.82 --> 1689.22]  as we sing
[1693.50 --> 1694.20]  as we sing
[1694.20 --> 1695.28]  for you.
[1695.30 --> 1696.44]  Thank you.
