[0.00 --> 10.94]  Ken, I really appreciate you praying for the local churches
[10.94 --> 13.00]  and for our brothers and sisters abroad.
[13.38 --> 15.76]  You provide a very helpful segue for me
[15.76 --> 18.36]  because I'm going to invite a couple,
[18.52 --> 19.74]  actually a family up to this stage.
[20.16 --> 22.10]  In our church, we have a number of people
[22.10 --> 23.28]  that I call the translators,
[23.42 --> 25.18]  and they always say we're not the translators.
[25.18 --> 27.58]  We study linguistics to do Bible translation abroad.
[28.14 --> 31.04]  But today is the last Sunday with Ben and Sarah Proctor
[31.04 --> 31.78]  and their little son,
[31.94 --> 34.04]  and so I've asked them to say a few words about where they're going,
[34.16 --> 35.12]  and then we're going to pray for them.
[35.26 --> 36.26]  So come on up.
[40.96 --> 44.04]  Yeah, so as Dave said, my name is Ben Proctor,
[44.16 --> 46.02]  and this is my wife Sarah and our son Anthony.
[46.42 --> 49.72]  And we've been studying linguistics at Trinity Western
[49.72 --> 50.74]  for the past two years,
[50.74 --> 53.64]  and we've been privileged to call Hope our church home
[53.64 --> 54.76]  during most of that time.
[54.76 --> 57.62]  Our long-term plans,
[57.86 --> 60.22]  we're part of Pioneer Bible Translators,
[60.54 --> 62.68]  and we are hoping to serve with them
[62.68 --> 64.02]  somewhere in Southeast Asia.
[64.76 --> 67.40]  Our immediate plans were from the States,
[67.46 --> 68.46]  so we're going to return there
[68.46 --> 69.76]  and rest for a little while.
[70.72 --> 72.04]  But if you could pray for us,
[72.10 --> 75.08]  just as we are still in this preparation stage
[75.08 --> 76.28]  to go to the field,
[76.38 --> 77.28]  we would really appreciate it.
[77.50 --> 77.86]  Thank you.
[77.86 --> 80.34]  Well, let me pray for you.
[82.32 --> 83.66]  Father, we thank you so much
[83.66 --> 86.90]  for the season of life that we've had with Benj and Sarah.
[88.08 --> 90.02]  We want to pray your blessing over them
[90.02 --> 92.66]  as they finish up their studies and their exams.
[93.96 --> 95.74]  And Lord, I thank you that they have a time of rest
[95.74 --> 97.14]  back home in the States,
[97.64 --> 99.64]  and we hold before you now
[99.64 --> 101.24]  their plans to go to Southeast Asia.
[101.24 --> 103.82]  We thank you for the desire they have
[103.82 --> 105.10]  to make your word known
[105.10 --> 107.64]  in languages that people can have of their own.
[108.56 --> 110.00]  Would you make their ministry fruitful?
[111.20 --> 112.50]  Would you bless their family
[112.50 --> 113.80]  and protect them in their travels,
[114.16 --> 114.78]  in their life,
[114.98 --> 115.72]  and in their work?
[116.60 --> 119.10]  And Lord, would your kingdom be expanded
[119.10 --> 121.42]  through the efforts of their work?
[122.18 --> 124.02]  We pray this all in Christ's mighty name.
[124.30 --> 124.54]  Amen.
[124.54 --> 124.74]  Amen.
[125.62 --> 126.54]  Thank you so much.
[129.10 --> 131.12]  There's a number of other translators at our church,
[131.34 --> 134.70]  and you're welcome to just find them after the service.
[135.28 --> 136.52]  Actually, a lot of them were at the 9 a.m.,
[136.52 --> 137.52]  but I see another one over here,
[137.58 --> 139.46]  and just hear about the work God is doing
[139.46 --> 140.40]  and preparing them for.
[140.84 --> 143.60]  I really feel like my own heart for Global Mission
[143.60 --> 145.34]  and also for the Bible translation.
[145.58 --> 147.86]  I did not realize how many languages and dialects
[147.86 --> 149.36]  do not yet have a Bible in their language,
[149.56 --> 151.26]  and I praise the Lord that in our church
[151.26 --> 152.42]  we have people who are studying
[152.42 --> 155.12]  and going around the world to make God's Word known.
[157.48 --> 158.98]  As Pastor Sid said,
[159.18 --> 161.20]  we're going to continue our series on forgiveness,
[162.10 --> 164.06]  and if you didn't hear last week's sermon,
[164.22 --> 167.10]  I do invite you to find it on the podcast or on YouTube.
[168.02 --> 170.66]  Sometimes we mock Pastor Sid for stealing our sermons,
[171.34 --> 173.44]  but as I was listening last week,
[173.48 --> 175.54]  I thought, man, this guy is such a gifted preacher,
[176.12 --> 177.56]  and he practices what he preaches.
[177.68 --> 179.96]  I was just noticing how so much of what he's preaching,
[180.10 --> 180.76]  he's living,
[180.76 --> 182.58]  and I think that's such a gift to us,
[182.60 --> 184.08]  so please do listen to that sermon
[184.08 --> 185.76]  because I'm going to be building on it this morning,
[185.94 --> 188.66]  and we're going to be continuing on it in the next two weeks.
[190.10 --> 191.66]  We're going to look at Matthew 18
[191.66 --> 193.78]  this week and next week
[193.78 --> 196.68]  because Jesus has a lot of teaching about forgiveness,
[196.94 --> 197.76]  and so if you have your Bible,
[197.90 --> 199.50]  turn with me to Matthew chapter 18,
[200.02 --> 202.34]  and we will start reading in verse 21.
[202.34 --> 209.08]  Then Peter came to Jesus and asked,
[209.66 --> 215.04]  Lord, how many times shall I forgive someone who sins against me?
[215.56 --> 217.36]  Up to seven times?
[218.60 --> 219.42]  Jesus answered,
[219.84 --> 221.92]  I tell you not seven times,
[222.30 --> 224.44]  but seventy-seven times.
[225.80 --> 228.40]  Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king
[228.40 --> 230.58]  who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
[230.58 --> 232.38]  As he began settlement,
[232.62 --> 235.96]  a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him.
[236.74 --> 238.04]  Since he was not able to pay,
[238.22 --> 240.26]  the master ordered that he and his wife and his children
[240.26 --> 242.64]  and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
[243.58 --> 245.78]  The servant fell on his knees before him.
[245.90 --> 247.42]  Be patient with me, he begged,
[247.60 --> 248.96]  and I will pay back everything.
[249.98 --> 252.16]  The servant's master took pity on him,
[253.04 --> 253.82]  canceled the debt,
[254.30 --> 255.08]  and let him go.
[255.08 --> 257.86]  But when that servant went out,
[257.96 --> 260.22]  he found one of his fellow servants who owed him
[260.22 --> 261.86]  a hundred silver coins.
[262.56 --> 264.68]  He grabbed him and began to choke him,
[264.84 --> 267.02]  saying, pay back what you owed me, he demanded.
[267.88 --> 270.38]  His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him,
[270.68 --> 272.60]  be patient with me, and I will pay you back.
[273.68 --> 274.56]  But he refused.
[275.40 --> 277.64]  Instead, he went off and had the men thrown into prison
[277.64 --> 278.86]  until he could pay the debt.
[278.86 --> 281.76]  When the other servants saw what had happened,
[281.86 --> 283.20]  they were greatly distressed
[283.20 --> 285.56]  and went and told their master everything that had happened.
[286.46 --> 288.18]  Then the master called the servant in.
[289.20 --> 291.84]  You wicked servant, he said.
[292.40 --> 295.42]  I canceled all the debt of yours because you begged me to.
[296.20 --> 298.44]  Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant
[298.44 --> 299.92]  just as I had on you?
[301.02 --> 303.68]  In anger, his master handed him over to the jailers
[303.68 --> 307.26]  to be tortured until he should pay back all he owed.
[307.26 --> 311.84]  This is how my heavenly father will treat each of us
[311.84 --> 316.24]  unless you forgive a brother or sister from your heart.
[318.94 --> 320.20]  It's a heavy teaching, hey?
[322.76 --> 325.90]  Right now I'm reading through a book by Ronald Ruhlheiser
[325.90 --> 328.42]  on spiritual growth, spiritual formation.
[329.08 --> 330.80]  He writes quite extensively on the topic.
[330.94 --> 333.00]  And in this book, he makes this comment
[333.00 --> 335.06]  about spirituality and stages of life
[335.06 --> 336.58]  that just kind of caught me off guard.
[336.58 --> 338.34]  He says, and this is a generalization,
[339.16 --> 340.64]  that in the first half of life,
[340.94 --> 343.64]  most of us struggle with the seventh command,
[343.76 --> 345.10]  which is do not commit adultery.
[345.92 --> 347.60]  In the second half of life,
[348.06 --> 350.02]  most of us struggle with the sixth command,
[350.12 --> 351.96]  which is you shall not murder.
[353.48 --> 355.20]  And that's a huge generalization.
[355.36 --> 356.86]  But what he's getting at behind this
[356.86 --> 358.08]  is that when we are young,
[358.16 --> 359.94]  we have very strong, youthful passions,
[359.94 --> 361.92]  which are a gift and also need to be curbed.
[362.32 --> 363.42]  And yet as we get older,
[363.42 --> 365.34]  those passions subside usually.
[365.98 --> 367.68]  And then a whole new set of concerns
[367.68 --> 369.08]  comes into our lives.
[369.76 --> 371.24]  The burdens of life,
[371.34 --> 374.28]  the heaviness and the unfairness of life,
[374.76 --> 377.90]  the wounds of people who betray us
[377.90 --> 380.86]  and attack us and are unkind to us.
[381.80 --> 382.90]  And generally, he says,
[382.96 --> 384.62]  there's two trajectories as you get older.
[384.74 --> 386.38]  It says you go in the way of bitterness
[386.38 --> 390.16]  and resentment and hurt and grudge,
[390.16 --> 392.04]  or you learn the path of forgiveness
[392.04 --> 393.48]  and you finish life well.
[395.24 --> 397.06]  I have a feeling that even as we preach
[397.06 --> 397.84]  through this series,
[398.58 --> 401.24]  some of the heaviness of your own life,
[401.64 --> 402.76]  the broken relationships,
[403.06 --> 404.36]  that argument you regret,
[404.74 --> 406.72]  those words you wish you could unsay,
[407.28 --> 408.48]  they come to the surface,
[409.20 --> 409.94]  and they should.
[411.06 --> 413.18]  Forgiveness is hard.
[413.98 --> 415.70]  We want to underscore in this series
[415.70 --> 417.26]  that forgiveness is not some simple thing.
[417.34 --> 418.18]  It's a hard thing.
[418.28 --> 419.20]  And the deeper the wound,
[419.50 --> 421.34]  the deeper the process of forgiveness.
[422.26 --> 424.26]  But let me just name that it is easier
[424.26 --> 426.92]  to hold grudges than it is to forgive.
[427.82 --> 430.12]  It's easier to passively, aggressively
[430.12 --> 433.16]  dig at your loved one or friend or co-worker
[433.16 --> 434.08]  than it is to forgive.
[434.40 --> 437.10]  It is easier to sabotage them on social media
[437.10 --> 438.54]  than it is to forgive.
[439.08 --> 441.04]  It's easier to retaliate
[441.04 --> 443.86]  and seek vengeance than it is to forgive.
[444.40 --> 445.74]  And it shouldn't surprise any of us,
[445.80 --> 446.24]  by the way,
[446.30 --> 448.48]  that there's so much teaching
[448.48 --> 450.26]  in the Scripture on forgiveness.
[451.10 --> 452.16]  In fact, when we were preaching
[452.16 --> 452.90]  through Galatians,
[453.02 --> 454.30]  I still remember when Pastor Sid
[454.30 --> 455.66]  was preaching on Galatians 5,
[455.98 --> 456.76]  where Paul says,
[456.98 --> 458.46]  put away all these old parts
[458.46 --> 460.12]  of your old life before you knew Jesus
[460.12 --> 461.86]  and put on the fruits of the Spirit.
[462.36 --> 463.96]  And listen to the list he adds
[463.96 --> 465.82]  when he says what we need to put away.
[465.82 --> 469.94]  Okay, bitterness, anger, fits of rage,
[470.64 --> 474.60]  malice, envy, hate, discord.
[474.84 --> 475.80]  You getting a theme here?
[476.38 --> 478.10]  All these things divide.
[478.98 --> 480.72]  All these things represent broken,
[481.00 --> 482.08]  fractured relationships.
[482.30 --> 482.68]  And then he says,
[482.76 --> 483.76]  put on the fruit of the Spirit
[483.76 --> 485.56]  because that's going to lead to healing.
[487.36 --> 490.32]  Jesus teaches a lot on forgiveness
[490.32 --> 492.34]  because it was just as much of a problem then
[492.34 --> 493.52]  as it is today.
[493.52 --> 494.50]  And today we're going to look at
[494.50 --> 495.62]  what Jesus says to Peter
[495.62 --> 497.34]  in Matthew chapter 18.
[497.48 --> 498.22]  So let's take a look.
[499.50 --> 502.52]  Peter asks a really good question to Jesus.
[502.72 --> 504.78]  And I bet you maybe in your own life
[504.78 --> 505.80]  you've asked this question.
[506.36 --> 506.82]  It's like,
[507.32 --> 509.18]  how much do I have to forgive?
[510.44 --> 512.56]  How much am I required to give
[512.56 --> 513.50]  my brother or sister?
[513.64 --> 514.70]  And then Peter adds at the end,
[515.02 --> 517.26]  up to seven times?
[518.00 --> 518.84]  And you should know
[518.84 --> 520.36]  there's good teaching background
[520.36 --> 521.34]  for why he says this.
[521.40 --> 522.66]  In fact, in Jewish teaching,
[522.66 --> 523.56]  rabbinic teaching,
[524.36 --> 525.82]  the general teaching was
[525.82 --> 526.82]  if someone sins against you
[526.82 --> 528.24]  one, two, three times,
[528.30 --> 529.06]  you must forgive them.
[529.14 --> 530.86]  But four and no more.
[531.38 --> 532.56]  There's a limit to grace.
[532.92 --> 534.16]  You don't just need to take it.
[535.30 --> 536.60]  And so when Peter asks this question,
[536.68 --> 537.76]  he's probably thinking,
[537.92 --> 538.82]  okay, I'm with Jesus.
[539.04 --> 540.30]  He changes a lot of things.
[540.60 --> 542.34]  He ups the requirements of obedience.
[542.52 --> 543.80]  So maybe if I double three,
[543.98 --> 545.04]  add one for good measure,
[545.16 --> 545.90]  and ask Jesus,
[546.14 --> 547.14]  is seven the one?
[547.30 --> 547.90]  He's going to say,
[547.98 --> 548.54]  yes, Peter.
[549.22 --> 550.00]  Seven's the limit.
[550.00 --> 552.26]  And what does Jesus say to him?
[553.50 --> 554.72]  Not seven times.
[556.24 --> 557.24]  Seventy times.
[558.16 --> 559.14]  And some translations,
[559.36 --> 560.32]  maybe your Bible has this,
[560.38 --> 562.28]  it says seven times,
[562.42 --> 563.94]  or seventy times seven.
[564.82 --> 565.96]  And if you're a literal reader
[565.96 --> 567.04]  of the Bible in this passage,
[567.12 --> 567.28]  you're like,
[567.32 --> 568.42]  well, what is it, Pastor Dave?
[568.46 --> 570.22]  Is it seventy or is it four hundred and ninety?
[570.28 --> 571.06]  Because I have a spouse
[571.06 --> 572.50]  who's hitting the high three hundreds,
[572.66 --> 573.18]  and I'm ready
[573.18 --> 574.78]  to pull back the grace.
[574.78 --> 577.08]  And I hope you know
[577.08 --> 578.78]  Jesus is speaking hyperbole here,
[579.00 --> 581.26]  and his answer to Peter is,
[581.82 --> 583.06]  I want you to match
[583.06 --> 585.02]  my limitless forgiveness.
[585.92 --> 587.64]  I want you to receive
[587.64 --> 589.82]  this unmerited,
[590.32 --> 591.88]  generous, abundant grace,
[592.20 --> 594.32]  and I want you to mirror that
[594.32 --> 595.86]  to the people who sin against you.
[596.74 --> 599.24]  It's an extravagant ethic
[599.24 --> 600.20]  of forgiveness
[600.20 --> 601.68]  that Jesus is inviting
[601.68 --> 602.72]  all believers into.
[602.72 --> 605.60]  And now I want us to look
[605.60 --> 606.48]  at this parable.
[606.68 --> 607.42]  Jesus goes straight
[607.42 --> 608.18]  from teaching Peter
[608.18 --> 609.20]  into this parable
[609.20 --> 610.62]  about this unforgiving servant
[610.62 --> 611.90]  or this generous master,
[611.98 --> 613.00]  whatever you want to title it.
[613.46 --> 614.52]  And in my opinion,
[614.78 --> 615.58]  maybe you'll agree with me
[615.58 --> 615.98]  at the end,
[616.08 --> 618.62]  this is a piercing parable.
[619.14 --> 620.46]  The first half is great,
[620.52 --> 621.24]  I want to stay there,
[621.30 --> 621.96]  but the second half
[621.96 --> 622.70]  is just getting right
[622.70 --> 623.34]  into our business,
[623.46 --> 624.26]  so let's take a look
[624.26 --> 624.90]  at this teaching.
[625.76 --> 627.44]  It's a parable about a master
[627.44 --> 629.02]  who has servants
[629.02 --> 630.08]  who have debt.
[630.62 --> 632.12]  And he calls in one servant,
[632.12 --> 633.12]  and we're told that this servant
[633.12 --> 633.94]  has how much debt?
[634.68 --> 637.32]  10,000 bags of gold.
[638.76 --> 640.02]  One scholar estimates
[640.02 --> 640.74]  that that is around
[640.74 --> 642.30]  a trillion dollars of debt.
[642.90 --> 643.96]  So this is supposed
[643.96 --> 645.32]  to maybe make us smile
[645.32 --> 645.70]  a little bit
[645.70 --> 646.10]  because this is
[646.10 --> 647.22]  an insurmountable debt.
[647.30 --> 648.44]  It's a national debt,
[648.50 --> 649.26]  not a personal debt.
[649.82 --> 650.66]  And so the master
[650.66 --> 651.62]  brings the servant in
[651.62 --> 652.22]  and says,
[652.30 --> 653.00]  you must repay it.
[653.06 --> 653.70]  He can't,
[653.74 --> 654.78]  and so he and his family
[654.78 --> 655.44]  have to be sold
[655.44 --> 656.36]  to repay the debt.
[656.56 --> 657.18]  And then what does
[657.18 --> 657.74]  the servant do?
[659.12 --> 660.00]  He begs.
[660.00 --> 661.22]  He says,
[661.56 --> 662.12]  forgive me,
[662.22 --> 662.96]  give me time,
[663.06 --> 663.92]  be patient with me,
[663.96 --> 665.04]  I'll pay it back.
[666.08 --> 667.00]  And to be honest,
[667.06 --> 667.96]  I don't know how to translate
[667.96 --> 669.00]  the intention there
[669.00 --> 670.42]  because it could be
[670.42 --> 670.96]  that he's just
[670.96 --> 672.08]  extremely penitent,
[672.64 --> 673.32]  but I also think
[673.32 --> 674.36]  he's just extremely ignorant
[674.36 --> 675.46]  because it's not like
[675.46 --> 676.16]  he's going to be able
[676.16 --> 677.04]  to pay this debt back.
[677.12 --> 677.56]  It's the equivalent
[677.56 --> 678.46]  of like working
[678.46 --> 679.50]  as a cashier somewhere
[679.50 --> 680.50]  at minimum wage
[680.50 --> 681.18]  and you're like,
[681.28 --> 681.86]  forgive me,
[681.92 --> 682.48]  give me time,
[682.66 --> 683.60]  I'm going to pay back
[683.60 --> 685.10]  my debt on 20 acres
[685.10 --> 686.04]  of land in Vancouver.
[686.94 --> 688.02]  It's not going to happen.
[688.54 --> 689.66]  You can't do it.
[690.82 --> 691.84]  And the master
[691.84 --> 692.74]  looks at this servant,
[694.20 --> 695.34]  he takes pity on him,
[695.74 --> 697.02]  or as some translations
[697.02 --> 697.40]  put it,
[697.42 --> 698.66]  he has compassion on him
[698.66 --> 699.42]  from his heart
[699.42 --> 701.06]  and he cancels the debt.
[702.06 --> 703.42]  He releases that servant
[703.42 --> 704.06]  free and clear.
[704.78 --> 705.88]  There's nothing left to do.
[707.54 --> 708.56]  And if you've grown up
[708.56 --> 708.98]  in the church
[708.98 --> 709.78]  or you know the Bible,
[709.98 --> 711.06]  you'll know where this parable
[711.06 --> 712.02]  is going in the first half.
[712.10 --> 713.34]  This is Jesus describing
[713.34 --> 714.84]  the insurmountable debt
[714.84 --> 715.86]  that we have towards
[715.86 --> 716.66]  our Heavenly Father
[716.66 --> 717.90]  because of our sin,
[718.54 --> 719.36]  because of rebellion,
[719.54 --> 720.46]  because of our idolatry,
[720.60 --> 721.48]  because of our choosing
[721.48 --> 722.22]  to follow everything
[722.22 --> 723.16]  except for God
[723.16 --> 723.84]  and we have this
[723.84 --> 724.88]  unbelievable,
[725.16 --> 725.82]  insurmountable,
[725.94 --> 728.02]  incalculable debt
[728.02 --> 730.04]  and we can't pay it back.
[730.98 --> 731.64]  And so the master
[731.64 --> 732.76]  that is our Heavenly Father
[732.76 --> 733.70]  through the work
[733.70 --> 734.90]  of his son Jesus Christ
[734.90 --> 735.54]  in his death
[735.54 --> 736.04]  and resurrection
[736.04 --> 738.80]  says that debt's dealt with.
[739.74 --> 740.50]  It's canceled.
[741.46 --> 743.18]  You are free to go.
[744.38 --> 746.30]  Nothing left to pay.
[747.66 --> 748.84]  That's the first half
[748.84 --> 749.90]  of this passage.
[750.30 --> 750.94]  And like I said,
[751.34 --> 752.62]  it's great to hang out
[752.62 --> 753.32]  and camp out
[753.32 --> 754.04]  in this first half
[754.04 --> 754.44]  of the passage.
[754.54 --> 755.42]  It's a beautiful thing.
[755.54 --> 756.58]  The gospel of grace,
[757.02 --> 757.94]  the mercy of God,
[758.10 --> 758.64]  unmerited,
[759.08 --> 759.60]  unwarranted,
[759.80 --> 760.36]  undeserved,
[760.64 --> 761.98]  just freely sent
[761.98 --> 762.76]  through Jesus
[762.76 --> 763.94]  to all those
[763.94 --> 764.62]  who receive him.
[765.60 --> 766.22]  But now we get
[766.22 --> 766.84]  to the second half
[766.84 --> 768.48]  and this is the punchline
[768.48 --> 769.46]  half of the passage.
[770.04 --> 770.54]  The servant
[770.54 --> 771.98]  who receives this grace
[771.98 --> 773.14]  goes and finds
[773.14 --> 774.06]  a fellow servant
[774.06 --> 774.56]  and how much
[774.56 --> 775.82]  does this servant
[775.82 --> 776.82]  owe the other servant?
[778.20 --> 779.88]  One hundred silver coins.
[780.94 --> 782.42]  You had 10,000 bags of gold,
[782.80 --> 783.88]  one hundred silver coins.
[784.22 --> 785.20]  And he goes to that servant
[785.20 --> 786.00]  and he doesn't just say,
[786.12 --> 786.86]  I want my money.
[787.02 --> 788.58]  He chokes the servant
[788.58 --> 789.42]  and he says,
[789.52 --> 790.72]  pay back your debt.
[791.56 --> 792.16]  And that servant
[792.16 --> 793.00]  says the same thing
[793.00 --> 793.70]  the first one did
[793.70 --> 794.18]  to the master.
[794.28 --> 794.42]  He says,
[794.48 --> 795.38]  be patient with me.
[795.44 --> 796.60]  I'll pay it back.
[797.60 --> 798.46]  But he refuses.
[799.30 --> 800.24]  And he throws that servant
[800.24 --> 800.74]  in jail
[800.74 --> 801.98]  until he can pay the debt.
[802.50 --> 803.58]  And then word gets around
[803.58 --> 804.50]  among other servants
[804.50 --> 806.00]  who bring what happened
[806.00 --> 806.86]  back to the master
[806.86 --> 807.74]  and now I want to read
[807.74 --> 809.10]  for us the punchline
[809.10 --> 810.02]  of the whole parable.
[811.94 --> 813.26]  We read these words
[813.26 --> 814.26]  from the master.
[814.50 --> 816.34]  You wicked servant.
[817.34 --> 818.98]  I canceled all that debt
[818.98 --> 819.28]  of yours
[819.28 --> 820.80]  because you begged me to.
[821.52 --> 823.00]  Shouldn't you have mercy
[823.00 --> 823.96]  on your fellow servant
[823.96 --> 825.38]  just as I had on you?
[826.38 --> 827.14]  In anger,
[827.24 --> 828.32]  his master handed him
[828.32 --> 829.12]  over to the jailer
[829.12 --> 829.74]  to be tortured
[829.74 --> 831.02]  until he should pay back
[831.02 --> 831.88]  all that he owed.
[833.06 --> 834.68]  This is how my heavenly father
[834.68 --> 835.78]  will treat each of you
[835.78 --> 837.22]  unless you forgive
[837.22 --> 838.12]  your brother or sister
[838.12 --> 839.40]  from your heart.
[841.76 --> 842.74]  Yeah, I heard someone else
[842.74 --> 843.88]  make that same sound.
[845.04 --> 846.76]  That is heavy teaching.
[848.32 --> 849.60]  And these are the kind of passages
[849.60 --> 851.18]  we can just gloss over
[851.18 --> 852.84]  or just want to stay
[852.84 --> 853.96]  in the first half of.
[854.66 --> 855.50]  And I just want to say
[855.50 --> 856.42]  unequivocally
[856.42 --> 857.94]  that forgiveness
[857.94 --> 859.56]  for those who follow Jesus
[859.56 --> 861.76]  is not optional.
[862.86 --> 863.60]  This is not some
[863.60 --> 864.80]  take it or leave it ethic
[864.80 --> 865.66]  that you can take
[865.66 --> 866.52]  if you want
[866.52 --> 867.80]  or leave if you don't like.
[868.10 --> 868.94]  I find sometimes
[868.94 --> 869.70]  we can water down
[869.70 --> 870.56]  the teachings of Jesus.
[870.72 --> 871.62]  We can sort of ignore
[871.62 --> 872.44]  these hard pieces.
[872.56 --> 873.28]  But Jesus says,
[873.74 --> 875.88]  forgiveness is a serious command
[875.88 --> 878.36]  with serious consequences.
[879.54 --> 880.20]  And I'm going to quote
[880.20 --> 880.80]  Dale Bruner,
[880.98 --> 882.68]  a commentator I very much like
[882.68 --> 883.90]  on the Gospel of Matthew.
[883.90 --> 886.24]  And this is how he puts it.
[886.48 --> 887.34]  And this is in contrast,
[887.50 --> 887.74]  by the way,
[887.80 --> 888.56]  to the Beatitudes.
[889.56 --> 892.24]  Unblessed are the unmerciful.
[893.46 --> 894.82]  God is forgiving,
[895.38 --> 898.14]  but God is not mocked.
[898.24 --> 899.56]  That's quoting Galatians 6.
[900.26 --> 901.20]  Where divine forgiveness
[901.20 --> 903.36]  does not have human consequences,
[903.58 --> 905.68]  it becomes divine judgment.
[905.96 --> 908.20]  So serious is the teaching of Jesus.
[908.20 --> 910.74]  And I do think
[910.74 --> 911.62]  that in the church,
[912.08 --> 913.10]  we can be people
[913.10 --> 913.72]  who want to hear
[913.72 --> 914.56]  all the stuff
[914.56 --> 915.44]  of the first half.
[915.76 --> 916.34]  Thank you, Lord,
[916.42 --> 916.98]  for your forgiveness.
[917.46 --> 918.84]  Thank you for the Gospel of Grace.
[919.00 --> 920.18]  Thank you for canceling my debt.
[920.36 --> 921.16]  And we don't even want
[921.16 --> 922.00]  to talk about
[922.00 --> 923.90]  what that means for us
[923.90 --> 924.66]  in all the broken,
[924.82 --> 925.64]  fractured relationships
[925.64 --> 926.32]  of our lives.
[926.46 --> 927.22]  We aren't willing
[927.22 --> 927.82]  to allow that
[927.82 --> 929.30]  to translate into mercy
[929.30 --> 930.68]  no matter what the wound,
[930.88 --> 931.78]  no matter what the hurt,
[932.06 --> 932.94]  no matter what the sin
[932.94 --> 934.16]  has been against us.
[934.78 --> 935.74]  It's all passive
[935.74 --> 937.68]  and no requirement.
[938.28 --> 939.58]  Or as Dietrich Bonhoeffer,
[939.74 --> 941.10]  a writer in the Second World War,
[941.18 --> 941.42]  said,
[941.72 --> 942.76]  it's cheap grace.
[943.58 --> 944.72]  It's all what you receive
[944.72 --> 945.92]  and nothing that you mirror
[945.92 --> 947.14]  and give to the others
[947.14 --> 947.76]  around you.
[949.12 --> 950.62]  Forgiveness is a serious command
[950.62 --> 953.16]  with serious consequences.
[954.48 --> 955.86]  And I want to read for you now
[955.86 --> 957.20]  that last part
[957.20 --> 958.52]  of the last verse again
[958.52 --> 959.40]  because this is what
[959.40 --> 960.14]  really got me.
[960.20 --> 960.84]  Not only is this
[960.84 --> 962.08]  a heavy teaching,
[962.64 --> 963.42]  but Jesus says
[963.42 --> 964.26]  in the very end,
[964.48 --> 965.16]  not just that we have
[965.16 --> 965.54]  to forgive,
[965.74 --> 966.08]  look at this,
[966.12 --> 966.68]  all caps,
[967.16 --> 968.22]  unless you forgive
[968.22 --> 969.34]  your brother or sister
[969.34 --> 972.18]  from the heart.
[974.82 --> 975.98]  Now, I'm a parent
[975.98 --> 977.78]  and if you have kids,
[977.86 --> 978.80]  you're going to relate to this.
[979.38 --> 980.70]  I've had conflict
[980.70 --> 981.28]  in my household
[981.28 --> 982.12]  with my children,
[982.44 --> 983.52]  my wife and I as well,
[983.80 --> 984.48]  but when our children
[984.48 --> 985.18]  have conflict,
[985.50 --> 986.30]  we try to be
[986.30 --> 987.02]  as good parents,
[987.16 --> 987.30]  you know,
[987.34 --> 987.86]  we bring them
[987.86 --> 988.92]  into conversation,
[989.12 --> 989.94]  we bring them together
[989.94 --> 990.90]  to hash it out
[990.90 --> 991.76]  and to forgive each other
[991.76 --> 992.52]  and we'll say
[992.52 --> 993.48]  to our one child
[993.48 --> 994.20]  to the other child,
[994.30 --> 994.48]  okay,
[994.48 --> 995.74]  now forgive your sister
[995.74 --> 996.74]  and you know
[996.74 --> 997.36]  how this goes,
[997.46 --> 997.66]  right?
[998.40 --> 999.20]  Say you're sorry,
[999.50 --> 1000.10]  I'm sorry.
[1001.12 --> 1002.36]  Say I forgive you,
[1002.60 --> 1003.46]  I forgive you.
[1004.22 --> 1005.00]  And Brittany and I,
[1005.10 --> 1006.86]  we have this practice
[1006.86 --> 1007.84]  of getting them to hug
[1007.84 --> 1008.54]  and I'm like,
[1008.60 --> 1008.80]  all right,
[1008.86 --> 1010.12]  now hug your sibling.
[1010.28 --> 1010.54]  They're like,
[1010.54 --> 1013.14]  do you have this
[1013.14 --> 1013.64]  in your household?
[1014.16 --> 1015.20]  It's not just us?
[1016.52 --> 1018.24]  And it's the most painful,
[1019.20 --> 1021.22]  graceless kind of forgiveness
[1021.22 --> 1023.34]  and here's the thing,
[1023.56 --> 1024.06]  I mean,
[1024.80 --> 1025.88]  we do the same thing
[1025.88 --> 1026.34]  as adults,
[1026.40 --> 1027.34]  it's just more concealed.
[1029.08 --> 1030.10]  We have all sorts
[1030.10 --> 1031.18]  of pseudo-forgiveness
[1031.18 --> 1032.32]  as adults
[1032.32 --> 1033.98]  and we don't talk about that,
[1034.58 --> 1034.78]  right?
[1034.82 --> 1035.36]  We have the,
[1035.48 --> 1036.38]  this happens all the time
[1036.38 --> 1036.78]  in our households,
[1036.88 --> 1037.04]  I bet,
[1037.10 --> 1038.16]  where someone hurts you
[1038.16 --> 1038.92]  or a friend hurts you
[1038.92 --> 1039.68]  and they come to you
[1039.68 --> 1039.86]  like,
[1039.96 --> 1040.06]  oh,
[1040.10 --> 1040.60]  I'm so sorry
[1040.60 --> 1041.18]  and you're just like,
[1041.24 --> 1041.38]  oh,
[1041.40 --> 1041.88]  it's okay
[1041.88 --> 1043.04]  and then you go home
[1043.04 --> 1044.30]  and it's not okay
[1044.30 --> 1045.24]  and you're,
[1045.24 --> 1045.48]  you know,
[1045.62 --> 1046.36]  gossiping about them
[1046.36 --> 1046.82]  for months,
[1046.92 --> 1047.58]  talking to all your friends
[1047.58 --> 1048.40]  about how hurt you are,
[1048.56 --> 1049.60]  you're willing to stab them
[1049.60 --> 1050.62]  in the back on social media
[1050.62 --> 1051.96]  but they think it's okay
[1051.96 --> 1053.62]  and this is common
[1053.62 --> 1054.68]  or you're,
[1054.76 --> 1055.02]  you know,
[1055.56 --> 1056.66]  you're willing to sort of
[1056.66 --> 1057.88]  find secretive,
[1058.08 --> 1058.80]  dangerous ways
[1058.80 --> 1059.66]  of finding vengeance
[1059.66 --> 1061.84]  and we do this thing
[1061.84 --> 1063.14]  as one of my pastor friends
[1063.14 --> 1063.42]  puts it,
[1063.44 --> 1064.44]  we do peace faking
[1064.44 --> 1066.38]  rather than peace making
[1066.38 --> 1068.32]  and the kind of forgiveness
[1068.32 --> 1069.54]  that Jesus invites us to
[1069.54 --> 1070.34]  is not just a forgiveness
[1070.34 --> 1071.10]  of words,
[1071.46 --> 1073.12]  it goes to this deep place
[1073.12 --> 1073.48]  of us
[1073.48 --> 1075.48]  that it comes from the heart
[1075.48 --> 1076.78]  that the forgiveness
[1076.78 --> 1077.74]  has to be real,
[1077.82 --> 1078.88]  it has to be this heartfelt
[1078.88 --> 1080.60]  release of revenge,
[1080.88 --> 1081.90]  this heartfelt desire
[1081.90 --> 1082.78]  for the good of the one
[1082.78 --> 1083.64]  who sinned against you
[1083.64 --> 1084.60]  and this ability
[1084.60 --> 1086.14]  to truly want their good.
[1089.00 --> 1089.88]  In this series,
[1090.02 --> 1090.80]  I've been on the hunt
[1090.80 --> 1092.32]  for a definition
[1092.32 --> 1092.86]  of forgiveness
[1092.86 --> 1093.48]  and by the way,
[1093.54 --> 1094.38]  if you've got a great one,
[1094.46 --> 1094.86]  let me know
[1094.86 --> 1096.12]  because there are so many
[1096.12 --> 1097.06]  and they often grab
[1097.06 --> 1097.86]  different dimensions
[1097.86 --> 1098.52]  of forgiveness
[1098.52 --> 1099.18]  and reconciliation
[1099.18 --> 1101.12]  but here's two
[1101.12 --> 1101.88]  that I like.
[1102.22 --> 1103.24]  The first is from Tim Keller
[1103.24 --> 1104.00]  in a book called
[1104.00 --> 1104.36]  Forgive,
[1104.66 --> 1105.58]  I commend that book to you,
[1105.64 --> 1106.42]  it's very good
[1106.42 --> 1108.52]  and he defines forgiveness
[1108.52 --> 1109.04]  very simply,
[1109.18 --> 1109.80]  he says forgiveness
[1109.80 --> 1112.04]  is renouncing revenge
[1112.04 --> 1113.86]  and being open
[1113.86 --> 1115.40]  to reconciliation.
[1116.52 --> 1117.82]  It is renouncing revenge
[1117.82 --> 1118.48]  and what I like
[1118.48 --> 1119.46]  about that second part
[1119.46 --> 1120.84]  is the reason he says
[1120.84 --> 1121.42]  be open
[1121.42 --> 1122.64]  is because you need to,
[1122.72 --> 1123.52]  you need two parties
[1123.52 --> 1124.42]  to reconcile,
[1124.72 --> 1124.88]  right?
[1124.88 --> 1125.72]  You both have to come
[1125.72 --> 1126.20]  to the table
[1126.20 --> 1126.78]  with humility
[1126.78 --> 1127.38]  and love
[1127.38 --> 1128.68]  to really reconcile
[1128.68 --> 1129.50]  unlike my children
[1129.50 --> 1132.00]  but you can forgive anybody
[1132.00 --> 1133.90]  even if they never say sorry,
[1134.30 --> 1134.98]  even if they never know
[1134.98 --> 1135.74]  how much they hurt you,
[1135.86 --> 1136.84]  even if they never come back
[1136.84 --> 1138.20]  to you after whatever happened,
[1138.34 --> 1139.44]  you can forgive them still
[1139.44 --> 1140.24]  and this is what Jesus
[1140.24 --> 1141.04]  is talking about.
[1142.78 --> 1143.96]  Dr. Gary Brashears
[1143.96 --> 1144.74]  has written extensively
[1144.74 --> 1145.78]  on forgiveness as well
[1145.78 --> 1146.94]  and this one I think
[1146.94 --> 1147.94]  teases out a few things
[1147.94 --> 1148.84]  that I don't see elsewhere.
[1148.98 --> 1149.38]  He writes,
[1149.38 --> 1150.94]  the heart of forgiveness
[1150.94 --> 1153.12]  is my personal act
[1153.12 --> 1154.96]  to release the one
[1154.96 --> 1156.46]  who sinned against me
[1156.46 --> 1158.00]  from my personal right
[1158.00 --> 1159.86]  to collect on the moral debt
[1159.86 --> 1160.54]  for the offense
[1160.54 --> 1161.72]  and this is where
[1161.72 --> 1162.42]  I haven't read
[1162.42 --> 1163.02]  anywhere else yet.
[1163.10 --> 1164.34]  Instead of giving back
[1164.34 --> 1165.72]  the pain I received
[1165.72 --> 1166.46]  because it's real
[1166.46 --> 1167.44]  and it hurts,
[1167.88 --> 1169.30]  I absorb the pain
[1169.30 --> 1170.20]  into myself
[1170.20 --> 1172.58]  with God's help
[1172.58 --> 1175.18]  and the reason I like
[1175.18 --> 1175.78]  the second half
[1175.78 --> 1176.38]  of that definition
[1176.38 --> 1177.28]  is because it sounds
[1177.28 --> 1178.82]  a lot like Jesus to me,
[1179.24 --> 1179.56]  right?
[1179.96 --> 1181.72]  Jesus takes on our sin,
[1181.82 --> 1182.72]  he takes on our offense,
[1182.84 --> 1183.86]  he takes on the ways
[1183.86 --> 1184.80]  that we rebel against him
[1184.80 --> 1186.34]  and takes it in himself,
[1186.82 --> 1187.58]  ultimately bringing it
[1187.58 --> 1188.16]  to the cross
[1188.16 --> 1189.46]  and dealing with it
[1189.46 --> 1190.64]  for us
[1190.64 --> 1193.66]  and by his grace
[1193.66 --> 1194.32]  we learn
[1194.32 --> 1195.82]  how to absorb
[1195.82 --> 1197.58]  that sin as well
[1197.58 --> 1198.70]  and have it transformed.
[1199.22 --> 1200.82]  There's a very popular phrase,
[1200.96 --> 1201.52]  maybe you've heard it
[1201.52 --> 1202.32]  in the counseling world,
[1202.38 --> 1202.72]  it says,
[1203.34 --> 1203.94]  sin and hurt
[1203.94 --> 1205.38]  that is not transformed
[1205.38 --> 1207.28]  is transferred.
[1208.12 --> 1208.72]  Have you heard that before?
[1209.18 --> 1210.46]  Sin that is not transformed
[1210.46 --> 1211.58]  is transferred
[1211.58 --> 1212.20]  and I think that's
[1212.20 --> 1213.86]  a really wise thing,
[1214.00 --> 1214.24]  in fact,
[1214.52 --> 1215.46]  non-believing counselors
[1215.46 --> 1216.18]  talk about this
[1216.18 --> 1217.38]  and what they mean by that
[1217.38 --> 1218.42]  is if you don't deal
[1218.42 --> 1218.94]  with the ways
[1218.94 --> 1219.92]  you've been hurt by people,
[1220.54 --> 1222.38]  it's gonna hurt other people
[1222.38 --> 1224.10]  or maybe a simpler version
[1224.10 --> 1225.22]  of this is hurt people,
[1225.64 --> 1226.06]  hurt people
[1226.06 --> 1227.82]  and that's why sin
[1227.82 --> 1229.80]  is so often generational sin.
[1230.32 --> 1230.62]  Let me give you
[1230.62 --> 1231.84]  two very common examples,
[1231.94 --> 1233.16]  a very grudge-holding,
[1233.26 --> 1234.12]  vindictive mother
[1234.12 --> 1235.92]  often raises children
[1235.92 --> 1237.38]  who grow up to be
[1237.38 --> 1238.24]  grudge-keeping,
[1238.38 --> 1239.34]  vindictive parents
[1239.34 --> 1240.36]  or, you know,
[1240.42 --> 1241.26]  the stereotypical
[1241.26 --> 1242.78]  angry, hot-headed father
[1242.78 --> 1244.18]  raises children
[1244.18 --> 1246.00]  who often grow up
[1246.00 --> 1246.58]  to be angry,
[1246.78 --> 1247.76]  hot-headed parents.
[1248.48 --> 1250.02]  That's sin
[1250.02 --> 1251.70]  that is transferred
[1251.70 --> 1253.86]  and what I'm after
[1253.86 --> 1255.00]  in this series,
[1255.10 --> 1255.84]  what we are after
[1255.84 --> 1256.96]  is how do we forgive
[1256.96 --> 1258.34]  people from the heart
[1258.34 --> 1260.34]  when the wound is real?
[1260.34 --> 1262.12]  Like, how do we allow
[1262.12 --> 1263.38]  Jesus by his power
[1263.38 --> 1265.16]  to allow us the grace
[1265.16 --> 1266.16]  to forgive
[1266.16 --> 1267.68]  and to not hold the grudge
[1267.68 --> 1268.68]  and to release them
[1268.68 --> 1269.20]  from vengeance?
[1269.76 --> 1271.14]  This is hard work
[1271.14 --> 1274.14]  and that is why
[1274.14 --> 1275.20]  when Pastor Sid preached
[1275.20 --> 1275.86]  last week
[1275.86 --> 1277.10]  and he talked about
[1277.10 --> 1277.60]  his relationship
[1277.60 --> 1278.28]  with his dad,
[1279.02 --> 1280.10]  he said this very quickly
[1280.10 --> 1280.90]  and I'm gonna tease this out
[1280.90 --> 1281.86]  more slowly this Sunday,
[1282.60 --> 1284.68]  that it took prayer,
[1284.68 --> 1287.02]  it took community
[1287.02 --> 1287.74]  and counseling
[1287.74 --> 1289.90]  and it took time
[1289.90 --> 1291.44]  to forgive.
[1292.84 --> 1293.50]  And I think those things
[1293.50 --> 1294.08]  are very important
[1294.08 --> 1294.92]  because Matthew 18
[1294.92 --> 1296.04]  commands us to forgive
[1296.04 --> 1297.24]  so we know that's there
[1297.24 --> 1298.58]  but it doesn't assume
[1298.58 --> 1299.10]  it's easy
[1299.10 --> 1299.94]  and it doesn't assume
[1299.94 --> 1300.60]  it's instant.
[1301.16 --> 1302.02]  And I think sometimes
[1302.02 --> 1302.96]  in the church
[1302.96 --> 1304.26]  we can simplify
[1304.26 --> 1305.30]  and even trivialize
[1305.30 --> 1306.08]  and harm people
[1306.08 --> 1306.86]  who are trying to forgive
[1306.86 --> 1307.90]  if they've got a deep wound
[1307.90 --> 1309.28]  and it is okay
[1309.28 --> 1310.60]  if we acknowledge
[1310.60 --> 1311.44]  just how hard it is
[1311.44 --> 1311.80]  to forgive
[1311.80 --> 1312.82]  and we say,
[1312.96 --> 1314.50]  I know I have to forgive them
[1314.50 --> 1315.16]  and I'm committed
[1315.16 --> 1316.30]  to the steps
[1316.30 --> 1317.88]  it takes to get there.
[1318.46 --> 1319.10]  I'm committed
[1319.10 --> 1320.22]  to the process
[1320.22 --> 1321.60]  whereby I'm gonna get
[1321.60 --> 1322.14]  to that place
[1322.14 --> 1322.86]  and it's released.
[1323.88 --> 1324.64]  And my heart
[1324.64 --> 1325.32]  is in a place
[1325.32 --> 1326.38]  of truly wanting
[1326.38 --> 1327.22]  the good of that person
[1327.22 --> 1328.10]  who sinned against you.
[1330.18 --> 1331.58]  And before I tease these out
[1331.58 --> 1332.36]  in a little more detail,
[1332.60 --> 1333.20]  I just wanna say,
[1333.30 --> 1333.90]  are you willing
[1333.90 --> 1334.70]  to do that?
[1336.12 --> 1336.82]  Are you willing
[1336.82 --> 1337.96]  to walk the hard road?
[1339.38 --> 1340.06]  Our hope
[1340.06 --> 1340.98]  in this sermon series
[1340.98 --> 1342.00]  is not just that we gain
[1342.00 --> 1342.62]  some information
[1342.62 --> 1343.26]  about forgiveness,
[1343.44 --> 1344.06]  we get some clear
[1344.06 --> 1345.16]  definitions about it,
[1345.36 --> 1346.02]  that we gain
[1346.02 --> 1346.96]  some teaching on it,
[1347.00 --> 1347.68]  although these things
[1347.68 --> 1348.52]  are very important.
[1349.68 --> 1350.68]  Our prayer as leaders
[1350.68 --> 1352.18]  is that the people
[1352.18 --> 1353.38]  that come to your mind,
[1354.36 --> 1355.56]  the strained relationships,
[1355.82 --> 1357.86]  the estranged relationships
[1357.86 --> 1358.60]  with family,
[1358.80 --> 1359.30]  with friends,
[1359.44 --> 1359.96]  with coworkers
[1359.96 --> 1360.52]  and neighbors,
[1361.52 --> 1362.22]  that God,
[1362.40 --> 1363.06]  by His grace,
[1363.24 --> 1363.90]  leads us
[1363.90 --> 1365.64]  to have that conversation,
[1366.52 --> 1368.16]  to reach out,
[1368.92 --> 1370.06]  to make some steps
[1370.06 --> 1371.62]  steps towards forgiveness
[1371.62 --> 1372.56]  and reconciliation.
[1374.40 --> 1375.12]  So here are
[1375.12 --> 1376.06]  the essential elements,
[1376.14 --> 1376.66]  and there's more,
[1376.76 --> 1377.48]  but I'm only gonna say
[1377.48 --> 1378.36]  three of them today.
[1378.68 --> 1379.40]  Essential elements
[1379.40 --> 1380.02]  that I think lead
[1380.02 --> 1381.64]  to heart forgiveness,
[1381.90 --> 1382.98]  to deep forgiveness,
[1383.36 --> 1383.96]  peacemaking
[1383.96 --> 1384.98]  rather than peace faking.
[1385.24 --> 1386.06]  The first should not
[1386.06 --> 1386.58]  surprise you,
[1386.66 --> 1388.14]  it is prayer.
[1390.04 --> 1391.58]  I don't think
[1391.58 --> 1392.90]  we could forgive
[1392.90 --> 1393.76]  very well
[1393.76 --> 1395.10]  without God's help.
[1395.40 --> 1396.02]  That's why I like
[1396.02 --> 1396.80]  the second definition
[1396.80 --> 1397.20]  of forgiveness.
[1397.20 --> 1398.40]  because we need God
[1398.40 --> 1399.46]  to help us do that.
[1399.76 --> 1401.26]  The reason this sermon series
[1401.26 --> 1402.04]  is taking place
[1402.04 --> 1402.98]  after Easter
[1402.98 --> 1405.60]  is because we wanna recognize
[1405.60 --> 1407.68]  that Jesus Christ
[1407.68 --> 1408.96]  who died and rose
[1408.96 --> 1410.10]  and went to heaven
[1410.10 --> 1411.58]  poured out His Spirit
[1411.58 --> 1412.24]  on the church,
[1412.44 --> 1413.78]  and there is a new power
[1413.78 --> 1415.04]  available for us
[1415.04 --> 1415.74]  to do things
[1415.74 --> 1416.34]  that we could not
[1416.34 --> 1417.04]  otherwise do.
[1418.12 --> 1419.60]  And that comes
[1419.60 --> 1420.68]  through prayer.
[1421.54 --> 1421.80]  In fact,
[1421.88 --> 1422.64]  one of the most challenging,
[1423.20 --> 1424.56]  there's the Heidelberg Catechism
[1424.56 --> 1425.04]  is a teaching
[1425.04 --> 1425.70]  in our church.
[1425.70 --> 1427.38]  It's a confessional document
[1427.38 --> 1428.26]  and it talks about
[1428.26 --> 1428.90]  how prayer
[1428.90 --> 1430.44]  is the shovel we dig
[1430.44 --> 1431.66]  and we gain these treasures,
[1431.84 --> 1432.40]  these abilities
[1432.40 --> 1432.92]  to do things
[1432.92 --> 1433.54]  we couldn't do
[1433.54 --> 1434.78]  that change the world.
[1435.90 --> 1437.22]  We need prayer
[1437.22 --> 1437.92]  to forgive.
[1439.18 --> 1440.58]  And I can't
[1440.58 --> 1441.88]  speak to your situations
[1441.88 --> 1442.80]  of conflict
[1442.80 --> 1443.60]  and forgiveness,
[1443.84 --> 1444.46]  but I'll just share
[1444.46 --> 1445.14]  briefly the way
[1445.14 --> 1446.06]  that I've experienced
[1446.06 --> 1447.06]  the Spirit
[1447.06 --> 1448.26]  working in me
[1448.26 --> 1448.70]  through prayer
[1448.70 --> 1449.50]  in situations
[1449.50 --> 1450.24]  where I've had conflict.
[1452.38 --> 1453.26]  That's okay, Bill.
[1453.26 --> 1455.38]  The first thing
[1455.38 --> 1455.94]  is this.
[1456.74 --> 1458.10]  Prayer keeps me
[1458.10 --> 1459.88]  from getting too proud.
[1460.84 --> 1461.86]  When you're in conflict
[1461.86 --> 1462.76]  and when I'm in conflict,
[1463.16 --> 1463.64]  what I do
[1463.64 --> 1464.82]  is I elevate myself
[1464.82 --> 1465.84]  and I denounce
[1465.84 --> 1467.78]  and speak very poorly
[1467.78 --> 1468.58]  about the person
[1468.58 --> 1469.16]  who's hurt me,
[1469.34 --> 1470.32]  whatever the hurt is.
[1470.80 --> 1471.40]  And I find
[1471.40 --> 1472.10]  when I'm praying,
[1472.70 --> 1473.68]  whether I want to
[1473.68 --> 1474.18]  or not,
[1474.26 --> 1475.08]  God reveals to me
[1475.08 --> 1476.34]  just my own brokenness,
[1477.22 --> 1478.20]  my own rebellion,
[1478.78 --> 1480.42]  my own part to play
[1480.42 --> 1481.42]  in this situation.
[1481.42 --> 1482.08]  And so often
[1482.08 --> 1482.68]  what you want
[1482.68 --> 1483.26]  the case to be
[1483.26 --> 1484.50]  is it's 100%
[1484.50 --> 1485.06]  their fault
[1485.06 --> 1486.24]  and it's 0%
[1486.24 --> 1486.74]  your fault.
[1486.82 --> 1487.50]  Then you start praying
[1487.50 --> 1487.80]  and you're like,
[1487.88 --> 1488.40]  oh man,
[1488.52 --> 1490.42]  I've got stuff to own.
[1490.80 --> 1491.40]  And not only
[1491.40 --> 1492.06]  in this relationship,
[1492.16 --> 1493.06]  but I've got all sorts
[1493.06 --> 1494.30]  of stuff that is egregious
[1494.30 --> 1495.18]  in the sight
[1495.18 --> 1495.98]  of my Heavenly Father
[1495.98 --> 1496.78]  and yet the grace
[1496.78 --> 1497.90]  of God is still mine.
[1498.78 --> 1499.38]  And so prayer
[1499.38 --> 1500.08]  keeps you
[1500.08 --> 1501.06]  from getting proud
[1501.06 --> 1501.70]  and it certainly
[1501.70 --> 1502.38]  has for me
[1502.38 --> 1503.56]  in situations
[1503.56 --> 1504.08]  of conflict.
[1504.16 --> 1504.88]  But the second thing
[1504.88 --> 1505.64]  very related,
[1507.24 --> 1508.12]  prayer has kept me
[1508.12 --> 1508.68]  from hate.
[1508.68 --> 1511.44]  Have you experienced
[1511.44 --> 1511.72]  that?
[1513.34 --> 1514.36]  In the situations
[1514.36 --> 1515.22]  where I am prone
[1515.22 --> 1515.74]  to hate,
[1516.06 --> 1516.80]  and I've had them,
[1516.94 --> 1517.94]  I've had them
[1517.94 --> 1518.78]  within my own family,
[1519.44 --> 1520.46]  I find when you
[1520.46 --> 1521.40]  hold that person
[1521.40 --> 1522.00]  in prayer,
[1522.86 --> 1523.72]  it's very hard
[1523.72 --> 1524.32]  to hate them
[1524.32 --> 1526.54]  because they are,
[1526.72 --> 1527.46]  whether you like it
[1527.46 --> 1527.94]  or not,
[1528.26 --> 1529.08]  an image bearer
[1529.08 --> 1529.58]  of God
[1529.58 --> 1530.90]  just like you.
[1531.90 --> 1533.06]  They are created
[1533.06 --> 1533.70]  by God
[1533.70 --> 1534.34]  in His image
[1534.34 --> 1535.54]  just like you.
[1535.54 --> 1538.74]  and they are loved
[1538.74 --> 1539.56]  by God
[1539.56 --> 1541.18]  just like you.
[1542.54 --> 1543.80]  They are no worse
[1543.80 --> 1544.52]  than you
[1544.52 --> 1545.68]  ultimately
[1545.68 --> 1546.80]  in the sight of God
[1546.80 --> 1548.54]  and you are no better
[1548.54 --> 1549.10]  than them
[1549.10 --> 1550.92]  and praying for someone
[1550.92 --> 1552.86]  forces you
[1552.86 --> 1554.30]  or I shouldn't say force,
[1554.46 --> 1555.74]  the Spirit enables you
[1555.74 --> 1557.20]  to not hate
[1557.20 --> 1558.30]  your brother
[1558.30 --> 1558.96]  or sister.
[1560.08 --> 1561.38]  It's a powerful thing
[1561.38 --> 1562.74]  and I can't explain
[1562.74 --> 1563.48]  how it works
[1563.48 --> 1565.14]  but in situations
[1565.14 --> 1565.68]  of conflict,
[1565.82 --> 1566.44]  prayer has kept me
[1566.44 --> 1566.98]  from pride,
[1567.08 --> 1567.70]  thinking I'm more
[1567.70 --> 1568.36]  than I am
[1568.36 --> 1569.66]  and it's kept me
[1569.66 --> 1570.02]  from hate,
[1570.12 --> 1570.76]  thinking someone else
[1570.76 --> 1572.40]  is less than they are
[1572.40 --> 1573.80]  and if you're stuck
[1573.80 --> 1574.52]  in that situation,
[1574.68 --> 1575.38]  I invite you
[1575.38 --> 1576.64]  to pray
[1576.64 --> 1578.54]  and when I say prayer,
[1578.62 --> 1579.56]  I should note also
[1579.56 --> 1581.04]  that it's not just
[1581.04 --> 1581.56]  something you need
[1581.56 --> 1582.24]  to do on your own
[1582.24 --> 1583.36]  in situations of conflict
[1583.36 --> 1585.04]  and all sorts of division,
[1585.50 --> 1586.28]  it's something you invite
[1586.28 --> 1587.32]  others to do for you.
[1587.44 --> 1587.64]  In fact,
[1587.68 --> 1588.68]  I know of two situations
[1588.68 --> 1590.34]  where the people
[1590.34 --> 1590.90]  in conflict,
[1591.06 --> 1591.96]  they're not interested
[1591.96 --> 1592.48]  in forgiveness
[1592.48 --> 1593.38]  and they're certainly
[1593.38 --> 1593.92]  not interested
[1593.92 --> 1594.76]  in reconciliation
[1594.76 --> 1596.56]  but their families are
[1596.56 --> 1597.86]  and the church was
[1597.86 --> 1598.76]  and so people started
[1598.76 --> 1599.52]  praying for them
[1599.52 --> 1600.08]  and interceding
[1600.08 --> 1600.60]  on their behalf
[1600.60 --> 1601.58]  and things started
[1601.58 --> 1602.68]  to happen in spite
[1602.68 --> 1603.38]  of those people
[1603.38 --> 1603.94]  in conflict
[1603.94 --> 1604.90]  and I just remember
[1604.90 --> 1605.66]  hearing one story
[1605.66 --> 1606.44]  thinking wow,
[1607.04 --> 1607.84]  God's Spirit
[1607.84 --> 1608.64]  is really at work
[1608.64 --> 1609.68]  in spite of the people
[1609.68 --> 1610.18]  in conflict
[1610.18 --> 1610.96]  and the community
[1610.96 --> 1611.84]  is surrounding
[1611.84 --> 1612.70]  and upholding them
[1612.70 --> 1613.06]  in prayer
[1613.06 --> 1614.22]  and things start to move.
[1614.32 --> 1615.44]  Do not underestimate
[1615.44 --> 1617.16]  what happens
[1617.16 --> 1618.84]  when we bring conflict
[1618.84 --> 1620.20]  before our Heavenly Father,
[1620.68 --> 1621.56]  before our Son
[1621.56 --> 1623.12]  who is the great reconciler
[1623.12 --> 1623.96]  and the Spirit
[1623.96 --> 1624.96]  who gives us the power
[1624.96 --> 1625.96]  to lean into some
[1625.96 --> 1626.90]  of the hardest places
[1626.90 --> 1627.54]  with grace.
[1630.20 --> 1630.60]  Secondly,
[1631.20 --> 1633.32]  we need our community
[1633.32 --> 1633.86]  of faith.
[1634.86 --> 1635.54]  I think one of the most
[1635.54 --> 1636.46]  destructive things
[1636.46 --> 1637.16]  and unhealthy things
[1637.16 --> 1638.10]  we can do in conflict
[1638.10 --> 1639.50]  is to isolate
[1639.50 --> 1641.12]  and it's tempting
[1641.12 --> 1642.00]  by the way to isolate.
[1642.10 --> 1642.62]  If you're in community
[1642.62 --> 1643.16]  and there's sin
[1643.16 --> 1644.02]  and you've been hurt,
[1644.20 --> 1645.20]  you want to pull back
[1645.20 --> 1645.94]  because you've been hurt
[1645.94 --> 1647.14]  and then you're stuck
[1647.14 --> 1647.86]  in your own head.
[1648.56 --> 1649.18]  Then you're stuck
[1649.18 --> 1650.28]  rehearsing the same things
[1650.28 --> 1651.46]  over and over and over
[1651.46 --> 1652.36]  thinking about
[1652.36 --> 1653.26]  what you should have said,
[1653.34 --> 1654.08]  thinking about how much
[1654.08 --> 1655.24]  they have sinned against you
[1655.24 --> 1656.00]  and you're just stuck.
[1656.54 --> 1657.68]  You need brothers and sisters
[1657.68 --> 1659.04]  who love you
[1659.04 --> 1660.68]  to encourage you,
[1660.88 --> 1662.00]  to pull you back
[1662.00 --> 1662.64]  into community,
[1662.92 --> 1664.34]  to keep you from bitterness
[1664.34 --> 1665.74]  that will take root
[1665.74 --> 1666.64]  when you're in isolation
[1666.64 --> 1668.98]  and in some cases,
[1669.54 --> 1670.08]  rebuke you.
[1671.46 --> 1672.56]  Rebuke you for thinking
[1672.56 --> 1673.50]  you're judgmental,
[1673.76 --> 1675.06]  for they deserve your vengeance,
[1675.30 --> 1676.22]  for thinking you don't need
[1676.22 --> 1676.78]  to forgive them,
[1676.84 --> 1677.42]  for thinking you're
[1677.42 --> 1678.70]  that much better than you are.
[1678.70 --> 1679.54]  There are times
[1679.54 --> 1680.10]  where you need
[1680.10 --> 1680.86]  brothers and sisters
[1680.86 --> 1681.96]  holding the scriptures
[1681.96 --> 1682.94]  in their hands saying,
[1683.60 --> 1684.18]  this is what Jesus
[1684.18 --> 1685.12]  invites us into.
[1685.88 --> 1686.42]  Are you willing
[1686.42 --> 1687.32]  to walk with us
[1687.32 --> 1688.52]  in the path of forgiveness?
[1690.92 --> 1691.88]  And thirdly,
[1692.48 --> 1693.72]  as I've already mentioned,
[1693.82 --> 1694.32]  I think it needs
[1694.32 --> 1694.98]  to be said again.
[1695.94 --> 1697.56]  Matthew 18 demands forgiveness.
[1697.94 --> 1698.82]  It demands that we
[1698.82 --> 1700.04]  be people who extend
[1700.04 --> 1701.28]  the extravagant grace
[1701.28 --> 1701.74]  of Jesus.
[1702.68 --> 1704.00]  But that doesn't necessarily
[1704.00 --> 1705.58]  make it instant or easy.
[1705.58 --> 1708.40]  And it is okay
[1708.40 --> 1711.40]  if time is needed
[1711.40 --> 1713.30]  for forgiveness.
[1714.40 --> 1715.80]  And I say that specifically
[1715.80 --> 1716.80]  to people who have been
[1716.80 --> 1718.10]  seriously wounded
[1718.10 --> 1719.00]  by others.
[1719.40 --> 1720.78]  And there are many of us.
[1721.16 --> 1722.02]  The wounds run deep.
[1722.10 --> 1723.10]  It's not hard to forgive
[1723.10 --> 1723.92]  small offenses.
[1724.14 --> 1724.62]  You know, you think of
[1724.62 --> 1725.32]  in a family unit
[1725.32 --> 1726.24]  with kids and all the rest.
[1726.66 --> 1727.54]  Sometimes we do things
[1727.54 --> 1728.60]  as, I forgive you,
[1728.66 --> 1729.38]  I love you, it's okay.
[1729.48 --> 1730.18]  There's other times
[1730.18 --> 1731.66]  where you are crushed
[1731.66 --> 1732.86]  to the core.
[1732.86 --> 1735.16]  And you can't even imagine
[1735.16 --> 1735.90]  what it looks like
[1735.90 --> 1736.68]  to forgive someone.
[1737.66 --> 1738.74]  And you hear this passage
[1738.74 --> 1739.80]  and think, oh man.
[1740.10 --> 1741.10]  And what you need to do
[1741.10 --> 1742.48]  perhaps in these circumstances
[1742.48 --> 1743.58]  is say, I know that's
[1743.58 --> 1744.02]  the command,
[1744.16 --> 1745.10]  I know that's the invitation,
[1745.58 --> 1746.34]  and I'm going to take
[1746.34 --> 1747.20]  the baby steps
[1747.20 --> 1748.96]  to get to that place.
[1749.02 --> 1749.98]  I want to get there.
[1750.38 --> 1751.42]  I'm looking forward
[1751.42 --> 1752.40]  to one day getting there.
[1752.46 --> 1752.94]  I'm just going to take
[1752.94 --> 1754.14]  the baby steps of prayer,
[1754.46 --> 1755.46]  of being in the church,
[1755.72 --> 1756.74]  of listening to the scriptures,
[1756.94 --> 1757.86]  of being among friends
[1757.86 --> 1758.52]  who follow Jesus,
[1758.68 --> 1759.52]  inviting their prayers,
[1759.64 --> 1760.46]  so that I can get
[1760.46 --> 1761.20]  to the place of saying,
[1761.28 --> 1762.60]  I have released you.
[1762.86 --> 1763.86]  From my heart,
[1763.98 --> 1765.10]  I deep down
[1765.10 --> 1767.36]  do not want vengeance anymore.
[1767.60 --> 1768.26]  Praise the Lord.
[1769.02 --> 1769.72]  He does that work
[1769.72 --> 1771.02]  over time in the church.
[1773.74 --> 1774.62]  To summarize,
[1776.08 --> 1776.94]  Jesus' vision
[1776.94 --> 1778.00]  in Matthew 18
[1778.00 --> 1778.74]  for the church
[1778.74 --> 1780.52]  is a radically
[1780.52 --> 1783.10]  forgiving church.
[1783.98 --> 1785.60]  A church that receives
[1785.60 --> 1786.82]  the unbelievable,
[1787.28 --> 1789.16]  undeserved grace of God
[1789.16 --> 1790.08]  through Jesus,
[1790.08 --> 1791.74]  that sets us free,
[1792.80 --> 1793.90]  gives us a new life,
[1794.22 --> 1795.10]  and then translates
[1795.10 --> 1795.80]  to a community
[1795.80 --> 1796.40]  that says,
[1796.74 --> 1798.00]  we can mirror that
[1798.00 --> 1799.32]  by the power
[1799.32 --> 1800.14]  of the Holy Spirit
[1800.14 --> 1801.92]  to those who hurt us.
[1802.10 --> 1803.34]  Not seven times,
[1803.82 --> 1804.84]  not 70 times,
[1805.20 --> 1806.76]  not 490 times,
[1807.04 --> 1807.68]  but through the course
[1807.68 --> 1808.72]  of our entire lives.
[1811.82 --> 1813.00]  When I've been reading
[1813.00 --> 1814.30]  over the last few weeks
[1814.30 --> 1815.00]  for this series,
[1815.48 --> 1815.94]  one of the things
[1815.94 --> 1816.80]  that struck me,
[1816.92 --> 1817.48]  and maybe you've already
[1817.48 --> 1818.10]  thought about this,
[1818.18 --> 1820.10]  is how the forgiveness
[1820.10 --> 1820.70]  of the church
[1820.70 --> 1821.76]  has been a defining
[1821.76 --> 1822.86]  part of its existence
[1822.86 --> 1823.60]  from the beginning.
[1824.88 --> 1825.60]  Forgiveness is just
[1825.60 --> 1826.54]  part and parcel
[1826.54 --> 1827.22]  of what it means
[1827.22 --> 1827.70]  to be the church,
[1827.76 --> 1828.48]  and there's so many
[1828.48 --> 1829.26]  beautiful stories
[1829.26 --> 1830.16]  throughout history
[1830.16 --> 1830.62]  of forgiveness
[1830.62 --> 1832.12]  that confounds
[1832.12 --> 1832.90]  the world.
[1833.54 --> 1833.86]  It's like,
[1834.00 --> 1835.26]  how did they do that,
[1835.32 --> 1835.78]  those Christians?
[1835.96 --> 1837.10]  How did they find
[1837.10 --> 1837.68]  the ability
[1837.68 --> 1839.14]  to forgive and release?
[1839.42 --> 1840.34]  Over and over again,
[1840.38 --> 1840.74]  you have these
[1840.74 --> 1841.50]  incredible stories.
[1841.62 --> 1842.20]  One that I have
[1842.20 --> 1842.84]  always loved,
[1842.90 --> 1843.70]  reading as a kid,
[1844.16 --> 1845.18]  is Corrie Ten Boom.
[1845.18 --> 1847.28]  She is a Dutch woman
[1847.28 --> 1848.78]  who went through
[1848.78 --> 1849.90]  the concentration camp.
[1849.96 --> 1851.18]  Her family suffered greatly.
[1851.32 --> 1852.26]  She lost loved ones.
[1852.64 --> 1853.30]  Later in her life,
[1853.34 --> 1854.08]  she survived.
[1854.48 --> 1855.22]  She encounters
[1855.22 --> 1857.00]  a Nazi soldier
[1857.00 --> 1858.34]  who is part of
[1858.34 --> 1859.24]  all these death camps,
[1859.40 --> 1860.32]  part of all the suffering,
[1860.58 --> 1861.54]  part of all the oppression,
[1861.74 --> 1862.74]  and she felt compelled
[1862.74 --> 1863.78]  to shake his hand
[1863.78 --> 1864.50]  and extend forgiveness,
[1864.64 --> 1865.56]  and she did.
[1866.66 --> 1867.66]  That's the power
[1867.66 --> 1868.70]  of Jesus Christ
[1868.70 --> 1869.40]  by his spirit.
[1869.80 --> 1870.58]  Martin Luther King,
[1871.00 --> 1871.94]  another famous example,
[1872.04 --> 1873.92]  and all the racial division,
[1873.92 --> 1875.26]  all the segregation
[1875.26 --> 1876.62]  that people in power
[1876.62 --> 1877.96]  were trying to impose.
[1878.28 --> 1879.30]  You have Martin Luther King
[1879.30 --> 1879.94]  standing up
[1879.94 --> 1881.18]  with a Bible in hand
[1881.18 --> 1881.48]  saying,
[1881.80 --> 1882.56]  I can forgive
[1882.56 --> 1883.88]  these politicians.
[1884.64 --> 1885.30]  I can forgive
[1885.30 --> 1885.90]  these police.
[1886.04 --> 1887.20]  I can forgive my neighbors.
[1888.04 --> 1889.12]  And then we work towards
[1889.12 --> 1890.44]  reconciliation and healing.
[1891.68 --> 1892.42]  Or I think of
[1892.42 --> 1894.42]  Rachel Denholler,
[1895.00 --> 1896.72]  this world-class gymnast
[1896.72 --> 1897.40]  who was abused,
[1897.52 --> 1898.22]  and in the courtroom
[1898.22 --> 1899.44]  of the coach
[1899.44 --> 1900.00]  who abused her,
[1900.04 --> 1900.34]  she says,
[1900.44 --> 1901.88]  I extend grace to you.
[1901.88 --> 1903.56]  And the courtroom
[1903.56 --> 1904.34]  was confounded.
[1905.88 --> 1907.42]  Maybe one of my favorite stories
[1907.42 --> 1909.80]  is in 2015,
[1910.20 --> 1910.66]  and you'll probably
[1910.66 --> 1911.66]  remember this in the news,
[1912.06 --> 1913.40]  when 21 Coptic
[1913.40 --> 1914.18]  Egyptian Christians
[1914.18 --> 1914.82]  were beheaded
[1914.82 --> 1915.92]  by ISIS.
[1916.66 --> 1917.64]  It's one of those events
[1917.64 --> 1918.28]  that actually put
[1918.28 --> 1918.78]  the persecution
[1918.78 --> 1919.40]  of the church
[1919.40 --> 1920.44]  on the world stage,
[1920.48 --> 1920.94]  and people said,
[1921.10 --> 1922.16]  wow, this is happening
[1922.16 --> 1922.64]  in our day?
[1922.66 --> 1923.12]  And the answer is,
[1923.34 --> 1924.06]  yes, it is.
[1924.90 --> 1925.92]  And you might not
[1925.92 --> 1926.64]  know this story,
[1926.76 --> 1928.02]  but many of the families
[1928.02 --> 1929.38]  of the men
[1929.38 --> 1930.26]  who were beheaded
[1930.26 --> 1931.90]  wrote statements
[1931.90 --> 1933.56]  and spoke on the news
[1933.56 --> 1934.48]  words of forgiveness
[1934.48 --> 1935.48]  to the terrorists
[1935.48 --> 1936.40]  who beheaded
[1936.40 --> 1937.02]  their spouses
[1937.02 --> 1937.84]  and loved ones.
[1938.64 --> 1939.30]  And there is
[1939.30 --> 1940.68]  a particular news anchor.
[1941.28 --> 1943.76]  This is an Arabic newscast.
[1944.38 --> 1945.54]  And they were going
[1945.54 --> 1946.34]  to do this interview
[1946.34 --> 1947.12]  about what had happened
[1947.12 --> 1948.18]  and just like fact-finding
[1948.18 --> 1948.66]  on what happened.
[1948.76 --> 1950.10]  And then they heard
[1950.10 --> 1950.96]  these words of forgiveness
[1950.96 --> 1952.08]  from the Christian families
[1952.08 --> 1953.50]  of the slain victims.
[1954.04 --> 1955.12]  And then the scene
[1955.12 --> 1956.16]  goes back to the newsroom
[1956.16 --> 1956.96]  and this man,
[1957.36 --> 1957.92]  Arabic man,
[1958.00 --> 1958.98]  his eyes are teared.
[1958.98 --> 1959.90]  You can see that his eyes
[1959.90 --> 1960.26]  are teared.
[1960.50 --> 1961.52]  And he's speaking in Arabic
[1961.52 --> 1962.42]  and there's a translation
[1962.42 --> 1963.04]  into English.
[1963.18 --> 1963.82]  And what he says
[1963.82 --> 1964.96]  in a very loud voice,
[1965.04 --> 1965.88]  he's not composed,
[1966.00 --> 1966.30]  he says,
[1966.76 --> 1967.64]  these Christians,
[1967.74 --> 1968.26]  he's not one,
[1968.30 --> 1968.46]  he says,
[1968.60 --> 1970.32]  these Christians are made
[1970.32 --> 1971.84]  of a different substance.
[1972.96 --> 1974.04]  How do they forgive?
[1975.08 --> 1976.08]  And when I heard that
[1976.08 --> 1977.04]  or I was reading that
[1977.04 --> 1977.60]  in the transcript,
[1977.70 --> 1977.98]  I was like,
[1978.40 --> 1978.84]  yes,
[1979.12 --> 1979.96]  we are made
[1979.96 --> 1980.92]  of a different substance.
[1981.96 --> 1983.30]  It's the power of Jesus
[1983.30 --> 1984.98]  by the Spirit of God
[1984.98 --> 1985.68]  that enables us
[1985.68 --> 1986.72]  to do what we cannot
[1986.72 --> 1987.76]  on our own do
[1987.76 --> 1988.78]  through our union
[1988.78 --> 1989.50]  with Christ
[1989.50 --> 1990.44]  by the life
[1990.44 --> 1991.38]  that is his through us,
[1991.68 --> 1992.86]  we can forgive
[1992.86 --> 1995.08]  and confound the world
[1995.08 --> 1996.34]  with a different ethic
[1996.34 --> 1996.86]  of grace.
[1999.22 --> 2000.24]  And so I want to read
[2000.24 --> 2001.04]  for us in closing
[2001.04 --> 2001.52]  a quote,
[2001.64 --> 2002.32]  this also comes
[2002.32 --> 2003.12]  from Dale Bruner,
[2004.88 --> 2005.72]  that I hope
[2005.72 --> 2007.24]  becomes a reputation
[2007.24 --> 2008.00]  of the church,
[2008.08 --> 2009.04]  of Hope Community Church.
[2009.04 --> 2011.46]  he writes,
[2011.56 --> 2013.32]  what makes Christians salty,
[2014.58 --> 2015.14]  different,
[2015.90 --> 2017.00]  and useful
[2017.00 --> 2018.58]  in the meat
[2018.58 --> 2019.72]  of the world
[2019.72 --> 2021.16]  is their breaking
[2021.16 --> 2022.50]  the world's code
[2022.50 --> 2024.22]  of love for love,
[2024.88 --> 2025.78]  good for good,
[2026.30 --> 2027.84]  and evil for evil,
[2028.22 --> 2028.94]  reciprocity.
[2029.94 --> 2031.04]  It is Christians'
[2031.34 --> 2032.24]  counter grain,
[2033.28 --> 2034.94]  counter cultural love
[2034.94 --> 2036.20]  for the undeserving,
[2037.02 --> 2038.02]  the unloving,
[2038.48 --> 2041.04]  and even the positively hostile
[2041.04 --> 2042.98]  that makes them
[2042.98 --> 2045.24]  recognizably Christian.
[2048.10 --> 2049.04]  Let's pray together.
[2050.12 --> 2050.56]  I'm gonna,
[2050.82 --> 2052.08]  I'm just gonna read
[2052.08 --> 2053.02]  the Lord's Prayer,
[2053.60 --> 2054.98]  and if you wanna murmur it with me
[2054.98 --> 2055.64]  or read it with me
[2055.64 --> 2056.48]  or recite it with me,
[2056.52 --> 2057.06]  you may do that,
[2057.10 --> 2057.94]  but this is the prayer
[2057.94 --> 2059.74]  Jesus taught us to pray,
[2059.74 --> 2061.06]  and it's a prayer
[2061.06 --> 2061.68]  that has led
[2061.68 --> 2063.02]  millions of believers
[2063.02 --> 2064.50]  into the ethic
[2064.50 --> 2065.14]  of forgiveness,
[2065.30 --> 2066.70]  so let me pray that for us.
[2069.60 --> 2070.90]  Our Father
[2070.90 --> 2072.44]  in heaven,
[2073.62 --> 2074.60]  hallowed be
[2074.60 --> 2076.00]  your name.
[2077.50 --> 2078.90]  Your kingdom come,
[2080.12 --> 2082.08]  your will be done
[2082.08 --> 2083.68]  on earth
[2083.68 --> 2085.44]  as it is in heaven.
[2086.66 --> 2087.96]  Give us today
[2087.96 --> 2089.38]  our daily bread,
[2089.74 --> 2091.48]  and forgive us
[2091.48 --> 2092.42]  our debts
[2092.42 --> 2094.48]  as we forgive
[2094.48 --> 2095.22]  those
[2095.22 --> 2096.06]  who have sinned
[2096.06 --> 2096.82]  against us.
[2098.06 --> 2099.20]  Lead us not
[2099.20 --> 2100.10]  into temptation,
[2100.74 --> 2102.46]  but deliver us
[2102.46 --> 2103.38]  from the evil one,
[2104.22 --> 2104.94]  for yours
[2104.94 --> 2106.20]  is the kingdom
[2106.20 --> 2107.94]  and the power
[2107.94 --> 2109.48]  and the glory
[2109.48 --> 2110.46]  forever
[2110.46 --> 2111.70]  and ever.
[2112.38 --> 2112.68]  Amen.
[2115.06 --> 2116.54]  Would you stand
[2116.54 --> 2117.28]  and sing with me
[2117.28 --> 2118.16]  a song of response?
