[0.00 → 2.24] Thank you, Mark.
[6.86 → 8.08] Good morning, Hope.
[12.72 → 19.10] Well, today, this morning, we get to continue our sermon series on the hard sayings of Jesus.
[19.94 → 27.80] And so I get to wrestle with you together on what it means to take on the yoke of Jesus.
[27.80 → 33.56] I think it's appropriate that we wrestle with this image of taking on work equipment.
[34.20 → 35.42] A yoke is work equipment.
[35.62 → 40.12] So if you're like me, and you didn't grow up on a farm, you might have forgotten what a yoke looks like.
[40.14 → 40.52] I did.
[40.60 → 41.44] So I had to Google it.
[41.58 → 48.10] This, you'll see on the screen, is a reminder of what a yoke would have probably looked like even in Jesus' day.
[48.48 → 50.10] So keep this image in mind.
[50.54 → 54.70] This is the image that Jesus is using to teach us something today.
[54.70 → 64.72] Now, this might be a little bit tough, especially when Jesus claims that this yoke of his is easy and light.
[65.64 → 68.16] Many times, it may not feel that way.
[68.64 → 73.40] And I think that's why this might be a bit of a tough passage that we have to wrestle with together.
[73.40 → 82.80] So, as we seek to be a blessing, as it was reflected in Leanne's interview for us, as we seek to be a blessing in our different workplaces,
[83.46 → 92.20] can you recall a time when you had a difficult time trying to do the hard work of doing it the right way,
[92.68 → 97.70] not taking any shortcuts, and then afterwards, how rewarding and fulfilling it was?
[97.70 → 102.18] So try to think of a circumstance when you had an experience like that.
[103.58 → 105.66] For me, I know this is not my job.
[105.92 → 109.70] And before I get to my little imagery here, a big shout-out to our sound technicians.
[109.98 → 113.32] I don't know if you noticed, the drums sound wonderful.
[113.70 → 118.16] Not because Jacob's good at playing it, although he is, but it sounds wonderful.
[118.28 → 120.76] If you can hear the difference, then maybe you should be a drummer.
[120.76 → 126.86] But anyway, it's not my job, and I'm not a professional drummer, but I've spent more than half of my life drumming.
[127.18 → 133.88] And I recall a time when I was growing up at our home where I tormented my family with countless,
[134.00 → 141.20] I'm talking hours and hours at a time, drumming away, trying to practice and work on the craft that God has gifted me with.
[141.56 → 145.64] Because at the time, I used it mainly for worship, which I do now too.
[145.64 → 155.58] But I spent those countless hours not just working on how to spin my stick and showing off and looking cool.
[156.08 → 161.88] I did the hard work of doing and trying to master each technique so that I can have more freedom,
[162.28 → 166.24] and it's more fulfilling when I worship with the rest of the band.
[166.70 → 172.72] That's sort of kind of image that I thought of that is reflected in what Jesus is teaching us today.
[172.72 → 178.84] So, the right way of doing something, it might be hard.
[179.22 → 180.52] It's not always easy.
[181.98 → 188.46] But Jesus, what he's offering us is true rest and a true way of living.
[189.30 → 196.20] And he's offering us to equip us in a life of doing the right thing, living in the way of blessing.
[196.90 → 198.62] And this is not by our own strength.
[198.78 → 201.34] We take on his yoke, not our own.
[201.34 → 203.42] And that's a good message for us.
[203.82 → 206.00] We're not called to take shortcuts.
[206.56 → 209.96] Living with Jesus in the way of blessing is hard work.
[210.44 → 212.04] But we are comforted.
[212.38 → 218.98] And Jesus refreshes our souls because he invites us to him, not anything else, not anyone else.
[219.52 → 224.86] It is the Lord of all creation who comforts and equips us for this right way of living.
[224.86 → 231.18] So, with that in mind, if you have your Bibles with you, we're looking at the Gospel of Matthew today in chapter 11.
[231.66 → 233.46] It'll be on the screen for you as well.
[234.46 → 241.28] We turn to the Gospel of Matthew chapter 11, and we read it in verse 25.
[241.28 → 243.68] At that time, Jesus said,
[243.68 → 272.10] Come to me, all who are weary and burdened.
[272.10 → 274.00] And I will give you rest.
[274.82 → 277.46] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me.
[277.76 → 279.56] For I am gentle and humble in heart.
[280.06 → 282.34] And you will find rest for your souls.
[282.90 → 286.42] For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
[286.98 → 288.64] This is God's word for us.
[288.64 → 296.96] So, upon reading and reflecting on obviously wrestling with some of the tough parts of this passage this past week,
[297.30 → 300.52] four questions kind of grasped me as I wrestled with it.
[301.10 → 305.20] The four questions will be on the screen for you because it kind of outlines the whole passage.
[305.84 → 307.42] Starting with the first question.
[307.86 → 312.00] Who exactly are the wise and learned that Jesus is referring to?
[312.96 → 314.02] The wise and learned.
[314.02 → 316.92] And then in turn, who are the little children then?
[317.90 → 321.42] And then the third question reflected in verse 27 is,
[322.02 → 323.84] Who is Jesus claiming to be?
[324.34 → 329.94] And why is that, why was it, and why is it even today, such a scandalous message?
[330.62 → 331.36] What's his claim?
[332.12 → 334.18] And then the last question, the fourth question.
[335.22 → 340.78] How is Jesus' burden and his yoke light for us?
[340.78 → 344.40] If we follow Jesus, how is it easy?
[344.98 → 346.76] Because many times it doesn't seem so.
[348.12 → 352.48] And so these are the questions that will guide us hopefully through our passage today.
[353.18 → 354.98] So, the first two questions.
[355.68 → 359.58] In order to get to the heart of this, you have to look at the context.
[360.22 → 365.72] And starting with the literary context, meaning the passages right before this, what we looked at today.
[365.72 → 372.26] Jesus speaks judgment against unrepentant towns that he ministered in.
[373.36 → 379.82] And it is very important to note that the purpose of Jesus calling on judgment was for the sake of salvation.
[380.00 → 381.76] And that's where our passage comes in.
[382.04 → 384.10] You can't take chunks out of the Bible and say,
[384.28 → 387.26] Oh, look, Jesus is like the Old Testament God.
[387.36 → 388.44] He just calls on judgment.
[388.86 → 390.60] You know, fire and brimstone kind of thing.
[390.60 → 397.90] But you have to look at it in the full context because Jesus is calling on judgment for the sake of wanting to save.
[399.10 → 401.20] Wanting to call sinners to repentance.
[402.28 → 404.74] And so, again, that's where our passage comes in.
[405.46 → 409.30] Right after speaking woes and judgment on these unrepentant towns or cities,
[409.88 → 413.30] Jesus turns to God and praises him and gives thanks to God.
[414.94 → 416.96] This is a bit odd, you could say.
[417.34 → 419.78] Even just going with the flow of the text.
[420.60 → 422.12] Because you could kind of ask,
[422.72 → 425.42] Jesus, I thought you were bringing your kingdom message,
[425.74 → 426.86] the good news of the kingdom,
[427.26 → 429.42] and that you, by your miraculous signs,
[429.52 → 432.00] would bring and have people become your disciples
[432.00 → 434.18] who would follow you all the way.
[435.12 → 438.68] But then you're calling on judgment on these unrepentant cities and towns.
[439.02 → 441.00] That's a sign of failure, isn't it?
[442.28 → 445.62] How come you're turning to God and giving thanks to him at this point?
[445.62 → 455.32] Well, the content of Jesus giving thanks to the Father is for not revealing this,
[455.44 → 458.84] the good news of the kingdom, to the wise and learned.
[459.48 → 461.74] And that's why we get to the first question then.
[462.42 → 464.90] Who exactly are the wise and learned?
[464.90 → 468.14] What does it mean?
[468.58 → 472.70] So Jesus can't simply be talking about smart people, can he?
[473.92 → 475.80] Anyone think they're smart here?
[476.64 → 478.74] Because the kingdom doesn't belong to you, apparently.
[480.22 → 482.72] That cannot be what Jesus is meaning here.
[482.80 → 487.86] He's not just pointing out to scholars and the religiously elite people.
[487.86 → 490.50] He's getting to the heart of the matter.
[494.60 → 497.36] The common theme that we see throughout Scripture,
[497.68 → 500.46] and we're talking both Testaments here, Old Testament, New Testament,
[500.76 → 502.68] Jesus didn't come to create a new religion.
[503.00 → 504.32] He's fulfilling Scripture.
[504.84 → 507.94] And all throughout Scripture, we see the common theme,
[508.22 → 511.32] that God opposes the proud.
[511.32 → 516.32] And he loves and has mercy on the lowly, the humble, the outcasts,
[517.06 → 518.66] the people who are in need.
[519.34 → 520.98] That's the heart of the matter.
[521.30 → 522.86] And that's what Jesus is getting at.
[523.38 → 526.60] Just to pull out some verses that reflect this theme,
[526.74 → 528.32] in Isaiah 66 it says,
[529.02 → 531.02] Has not my hand made all these things,
[531.06 → 534.00] and so they came into being, declares the Lord our God.
[534.90 → 535.90] So he says,
[535.90 → 538.18] These are the ones I look on with favour,
[538.96 → 542.10] those who are humble and contrite in spirit,
[542.62 → 544.24] and who tremble at my word.
[545.22 → 546.68] Same idea, Proverbs 3.
[547.18 → 549.56] He mocks proud mockers,
[549.72 → 552.58] but shows favour to the humble and oppressed.
[554.18 → 558.80] So this theme of humbling the proud and exalting the humble,
[559.08 → 560.90] you can find all throughout Scripture,
[561.54 → 563.36] arguably from Genesis to Revelation.
[563.36 → 566.12] And you have specific examples like this,
[566.40 → 568.94] in the book of Job, Proverbs, Ezekiel, Matthew,
[569.28 → 571.00] specifically in Luke's Gospel,
[571.34 → 574.10] where Jesus says that I have come for the sick.
[575.06 → 576.74] I have come to heal the sick,
[577.32 → 578.22] not for the healthy.
[578.78 → 581.26] Again, he's not just referring to people who are healthy,
[581.52 → 582.54] you know, physically speaking.
[582.92 → 585.36] He's here, and he offers salvation,
[585.50 → 589.28] and he invites us comfort for those who are lowly and humble.
[590.14 → 591.98] That's the heart of the issue here.
[591.98 → 596.24] So it's safe to say, again, those who are scholars here,
[596.38 → 598.54] those who think they're smart, it's okay, you're safe.
[598.76 → 599.90] This is a heart issue.
[600.22 → 601.90] He's not just referring to smart people.
[603.12 → 604.28] God opposes the proud.
[604.84 → 605.58] And so in other words,
[605.90 → 607.88] Jesus is speaking against to those
[607.88 → 609.82] who have the temptation to think,
[609.96 → 610.98] either on the one hand,
[611.64 → 613.18] that we can overcome anything
[613.18 → 614.98] by our own wisdom and strength,
[615.36 → 617.24] where we sit on God's throne and say,
[617.64 → 619.76] I can handle it, don't need God.
[619.76 → 624.20] Or he's also speaking to the heart of the matter,
[624.20 → 628.42] to those who think that just because they work closely
[628.42 → 629.56] to the word of God,
[630.16 → 634.28] that they especially have privileges
[634.28 → 636.10] and are closer to God,
[636.24 → 638.04] and that they are holier than other people.
[638.04 → 641.96] Like as if there are holy jobs and vocations
[641.96 → 645.52] compared to secular, quote-unquote, secular jobs.
[646.96 → 648.56] And what I just mentioned now,
[648.74 → 650.24] holy jobs versus secular jobs,
[650.96 → 653.04] that's sadly a reality in our church history,
[653.22 → 655.08] in our Christian history.
[655.08 → 658.24] Whether intentionally or not,
[658.56 → 661.76] Christians have so commonly set up hierarchies of jobs,
[662.02 → 664.46] thinking that only if you work for the church
[664.46 → 665.76] or a Christian organization,
[666.18 → 666.82] you are holier.
[667.14 → 668.30] I grew up with that.
[669.40 → 669.60] Right?
[669.76 → 670.84] You got to protect the pastors,
[670.96 → 671.74] they're holier or something.
[673.94 → 677.00] This is the pride that God is opposing,
[677.10 → 678.40] that Jesus is speaking into.
[679.40 → 680.98] Whatever job you have,
[681.12 → 683.10] all workplaces and our vocations,
[683.28 → 683.96] our calling,
[684.36 → 686.12] as we heard from even Leanne this morning,
[686.74 → 689.16] is we can reflect God's goodness
[689.16 → 691.24] and be a light for the world everywhere.
[692.10 → 694.56] The calling is to be His disciples
[694.56 → 695.94] with our whole lives,
[696.78 → 698.94] not to just look out for the holy jobs
[698.94 → 699.36] and say,
[699.66 → 700.44] okay, I'm set,
[700.64 → 701.50] I'm closer to God,
[701.56 → 702.60] I have special privileges
[702.60 → 704.22] because I work for the church.
[704.22 → 708.36] God calls us everywhere,
[708.58 → 709.36] in every corner,
[709.50 → 710.02] as Dave said,
[710.82 → 712.30] of our workplaces as well.
[713.94 → 715.62] And so just like the Sermon on the Mount,
[716.40 → 718.10] when Jesus rebukes the Pharisees
[718.10 → 719.28] and the religiously proud,
[719.70 → 720.32] same message.
[720.64 → 722.24] Jesus is speaking to the heart.
[722.46 → 724.26] He's speaking against the pride
[724.26 → 726.18] that we all have the temptation of
[726.18 → 727.04] within our hearts.
[727.32 → 728.50] Whether you show it or not,
[728.86 → 730.14] it is a challenge,
[730.40 → 731.92] a temptation that we can all have.
[732.34 → 734.14] And so this commentator that I was studying,
[734.96 → 736.86] captures the essence of the first two verses,
[737.02 → 738.16] what Jesus is saying here.
[739.14 → 741.48] Those who feel their spiritual brilliance
[741.48 → 745.78] and are sorry for those who fall so far beneath them,
[745.96 → 747.82] who bask in self-importance
[747.82 → 750.12] and feel God is lucky to have them,
[750.98 → 753.72] these find in Jesus' Father a back.
[755.36 → 758.18] But those who feel their sin
[758.18 → 759.52] are sorry for it
[759.52 → 761.02] and come asking for help,
[761.02 → 763.40] these find in Jesus' Father
[763.40 → 764.56] open arms.
[766.84 → 768.26] And these latter people,
[769.56 → 771.12] these people that are humble,
[771.58 → 773.00] these are the little children
[773.00 → 774.56] that Jesus is referring to.
[775.76 → 777.58] The humble, the lowly,
[778.10 → 779.08] the people that know
[779.08 → 780.60] and depend on their Saviour.
[780.60 → 783.82] Again, this is what it means
[783.82 → 784.96] to be true disciples
[784.96 → 786.80] as compared to the crowd
[786.80 → 789.64] who are sitting far away from Jesus,
[790.06 → 790.70] listening and saying,
[790.80 → 792.18] okay, those are some wise thoughts,
[792.94 → 795.38] but I'll give it a thought.
[796.10 → 797.66] But I don't know if I want to commit to you.
[797.88 → 799.28] I don't know if I want to follow you
[799.28 → 800.32] with my whole life.
[801.30 → 802.36] Because that would mean
[802.36 → 804.78] that you are a true disciple,
[805.48 → 806.88] a true follower of Christ.
[806.88 → 809.34] And so even the disciples
[809.34 → 811.64] that were following Jesus at the time,
[812.02 → 814.04] they weren't necessarily smarter people
[814.04 → 815.14] or better off people
[815.14 → 817.46] or holier religious people.
[818.20 → 819.60] They were common folk,
[820.40 → 821.10] tax collectors,
[821.78 → 822.74] zealots, fishermen.
[824.20 → 826.34] They were simply people who knew
[826.34 → 828.82] that they had nowhere else to go
[828.82 → 831.10] than to follow their only Lord and Saviour.
[831.42 → 833.50] That's who the disciples were.
[833.50 → 836.82] And again, referring back
[836.82 → 837.68] to the Sermon on the Mount.
[838.88 → 840.12] The Beatitudes, the blessings
[840.12 → 841.96] that Jesus starts His sermon with,
[842.36 → 843.20] the first one,
[843.26 → 844.16] do you know what it starts with?
[845.12 → 846.08] We did this series
[846.08 → 847.64] like a couple of summers back.
[848.22 → 849.38] You remember it perfectly, right?
[849.50 → 850.26] All the blessings.
[850.70 → 851.98] Blessed are the, the first one,
[852.22 → 855.14] blessed are the poor in spirit.
[856.08 → 857.34] Blessed are the humble.
[857.72 → 859.54] Blessed are those who are lowly
[859.54 → 860.50] and outcasts who know
[860.50 → 863.50] that they are in need of a Saviour.
[864.66 → 866.70] For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[868.40 → 870.62] That's who the kingdom belongs to.
[870.82 → 871.62] Same idea.
[871.94 → 872.98] These are the little children.
[873.42 → 874.72] And Pastor Dave even preached this
[874.72 → 876.14] a few weeks back.
[876.36 → 877.96] Matthew 18, we read together.
[878.68 → 879.92] Truly I tell you,
[880.38 → 881.62] unless you change
[881.62 → 883.28] and become like little children,
[883.62 → 884.54] you will never enter
[884.54 → 885.34] the kingdom of heaven.
[886.30 → 887.70] The kingdom belongs
[887.70 → 889.90] to little children as these.
[892.48 → 894.18] So that's the heart of the matter.
[894.62 → 895.86] The kingdom is revealed
[895.86 → 896.42] to the humble.
[896.82 → 898.20] This is the Father's will.
[898.66 → 899.66] That's what Jesus says.
[901.40 → 905.22] This is what you are pleased with, Father.
[905.32 → 906.26] This is your will.
[907.04 → 908.56] And then we jump to verse 27.
[908.84 → 909.60] And here is where
[909.60 → 911.12] that audacious claim comes in.
[911.92 → 913.30] In verse 27, Jesus says
[913.30 → 915.18] that all of these things
[915.18 → 916.90] have been committed to Him
[916.90 → 917.54] by the Father.
[918.68 → 919.46] In other words,
[920.24 → 921.22] the Father's will
[921.22 → 923.80] is done exclusively
[923.80 → 925.92] only through Jesus.
[928.80 → 930.12] He's claiming to be
[930.12 → 931.26] on equal status
[931.26 → 932.60] as the Father God.
[933.74 → 935.68] So who's listening to Jesus right now
[935.68 → 936.94] in Matthew 11 here?
[938.10 → 939.04] Who's the audience?
[940.98 → 941.98] Are they the Greeks,
[942.10 → 942.64] the Gentiles?
[943.54 → 945.46] No, they were mainly the Jews,
[945.46 → 947.62] the monotheistic Jews,
[947.74 → 949.36] meaning they only believe
[949.36 → 950.64] in one God,
[950.74 → 951.40] just like we do.
[951.94 → 953.32] We believe that God is one.
[954.00 → 954.98] But we also believe
[954.98 → 957.06] that Jesus is the Son of God.
[957.32 → 958.18] He is God Himself
[958.18 → 961.68] who came to take on human flesh
[961.68 → 963.40] to die for our sins.
[964.06 → 965.26] This is Jesus' claim.
[966.12 → 967.10] And for those listening,
[967.78 → 969.54] they had every right to get mad.
[970.16 → 971.06] They had every right,
[971.12 → 972.64] even according to their scripture,
[972.64 → 974.80] our own Old Testament,
[975.28 → 976.40] to stone this person,
[976.52 → 976.76] Jesus,
[976.96 → 978.48] for making this audacious claim.
[979.48 → 981.06] You get why this message
[981.06 → 981.90] is so scandalous?
[983.02 → 983.82] Jesus is saying,
[983.96 → 984.48] I am God.
[984.78 → 986.10] I am the only way,
[986.92 → 987.54] the truth,
[987.60 → 988.28] and the life.
[988.92 → 990.02] No one comes to the Father
[990.02 → 990.84] except through me.
[992.08 → 993.02] Same message here.
[993.46 → 993.98] All things,
[994.10 → 995.70] Santa is the great Greek word,
[995.70 → 997.32] all things have been committed
[997.32 → 998.34] to Him by the Father.
[999.36 → 1000.74] And this kingdom is revealed
[1000.74 → 1002.38] to those only to whom
[1002.38 → 1003.56] the Son reveals it to.
[1004.42 → 1005.70] He is the only way.
[1006.90 → 1008.34] And that's our call to faith,
[1008.42 → 1008.72] isn't it?
[1009.50 → 1011.06] Even when we get baptized,
[1011.30 → 1012.64] we become members of the church.
[1013.06 → 1013.90] That is the question
[1013.90 → 1015.44] that we're all challenged,
[1015.62 → 1016.12] wrestle with,
[1016.28 → 1017.66] and answer in faith.
[1018.40 → 1020.12] Do you believe that Jesus Christ
[1020.12 → 1021.14] is your Lord and Saviour?
[1021.14 → 1023.70] Do you believe that He is
[1023.70 → 1025.80] the only way to be saved?
[1027.66 → 1029.82] That is Jesus' claim
[1029.82 → 1031.46] and His invitation
[1031.46 → 1033.40] to us and for the people
[1033.40 → 1034.24] that are listening here.
[1038.96 → 1040.84] To accept and confess
[1040.84 → 1043.64] that Jesus is Lord of our lives,
[1043.80 → 1045.30] that He is our only path
[1045.30 → 1045.92] to salvation,
[1046.42 → 1047.24] and the path to living
[1047.24 → 1048.30] a life of blessing,
[1048.94 → 1050.14] has huge implications,
[1050.14 → 1051.22] implications, by the way.
[1052.10 → 1053.30] Again, it's not,
[1053.48 → 1053.76] you're just,
[1053.86 → 1055.52] you're not sitting on the edge,
[1056.14 → 1056.92] keeping your distance
[1056.92 → 1057.48] and saying,
[1057.64 → 1058.16] oh yeah, yeah, yeah,
[1058.16 → 1059.02] I know Jesus.
[1059.18 → 1060.54] I know, I believe the guy.
[1061.20 → 1062.22] Yeah, I'm Christian.
[1062.40 → 1064.16] I go to church twice a year.
[1064.58 → 1065.04] I'm fine.
[1066.48 → 1068.00] Jesus is pulling us,
[1068.06 → 1069.90] inviting us to walk along
[1069.90 → 1071.20] with Him every step
[1071.20 → 1072.14] of our lives.
[1073.22 → 1075.36] Our faith, we confess,
[1075.50 → 1076.90] is that our whole lives
[1076.90 → 1077.66] belong to Him.
[1077.82 → 1078.84] Not just on Sunday,
[1078.84 → 1080.96] not just when we feel
[1080.96 → 1081.80] like we want to pray,
[1082.40 → 1084.54] not just when we need God
[1084.54 → 1085.42] for something,
[1086.16 → 1088.30] but for every single step,
[1088.40 → 1089.68] every moment of our lives,
[1089.86 → 1091.72] we say it belongs to Him.
[1092.00 → 1093.76] Just like Paul writes
[1093.76 → 1094.16] in his letter
[1094.16 → 1095.22] to the Colossian church.
[1096.18 → 1097.06] For in Him,
[1097.24 → 1097.86] in Jesus,
[1098.06 → 1099.18] all things were created,
[1099.44 → 1100.10] things in heaven
[1100.10 → 1100.72] and on earth,
[1101.02 → 1102.18] visible and invisible,
[1102.62 → 1103.36] whether thrones
[1103.36 → 1104.56] or powers or authorities,
[1105.16 → 1106.10] all things,
[1106.18 → 1106.86] same Greek word,
[1106.86 → 1107.34] Santa,
[1107.60 → 1109.06] all things have been created
[1109.06 → 1110.58] through Him and for Him.
[1111.82 → 1113.52] He is before all things
[1113.52 → 1114.36] and in Him,
[1114.46 → 1116.28] all things hold together,
[1117.38 → 1119.66] including our salvation.
[1119.66 → 1123.28] it is through the death
[1123.28 → 1124.96] and resurrection of Jesus
[1124.96 → 1126.86] that we are called His children.
[1127.14 → 1128.70] Not by our own strength,
[1128.92 → 1130.32] not by our own works,
[1131.32 → 1134.78] but only through His loving grace.
[1136.36 → 1137.76] That's Jesus' claim.
[1138.58 → 1140.16] That's verse 27 for us.
[1142.20 → 1143.48] Then one of my favourite verses
[1143.48 → 1144.16] in the whole Bible,
[1145.00 → 1145.22] right?
[1145.22 → 1146.46] Very popular.
[1146.62 → 1148.96] For it is by grace
[1148.96 → 1150.10] you have been saved
[1150.10 → 1151.22] through faith.
[1151.90 → 1153.90] And this is not from yourselves.
[1154.62 → 1156.08] It is the gift of God.
[1156.62 → 1157.70] Not by works
[1157.70 → 1160.14] so that no one can boast.
[1161.42 → 1162.28] What's boasting?
[1163.46 → 1164.64] What is it speaking to?
[1164.90 → 1166.38] It's speaking to pride.
[1167.38 → 1167.54] Right?
[1167.66 → 1168.40] Same message.
[1168.92 → 1170.38] God opposes the proud.
[1170.76 → 1171.56] Not just scholars,
[1171.70 → 1172.64] not just smart people.
[1172.86 → 1173.90] That's not the heart of it.
[1173.90 → 1175.46] He opposes the proud.
[1175.80 → 1176.36] Those who think
[1176.36 → 1177.86] they have it all figured out.
[1178.26 → 1179.10] Those who think
[1179.10 → 1180.30] that they don't need God.
[1180.44 → 1181.40] Or those who think
[1181.40 → 1181.96] they're privileged
[1181.96 → 1183.20] because they work for God.
[1183.60 → 1185.26] They have a holy job or something.
[1186.16 → 1186.38] No.
[1186.92 → 1188.66] God calls and invites
[1188.66 → 1190.46] the humble and the lowly.
[1193.38 → 1194.92] So no one can boast
[1194.92 → 1196.62] and our whole lives belong to Him.
[1196.84 → 1197.92] And then you have to ask
[1197.92 → 1198.80] the follow-up question.
[1199.16 → 1200.42] Because Paul doesn't end there.
[1201.34 → 1202.54] Paul doesn't stop his letter
[1202.54 → 1202.92] saying,
[1202.92 → 1203.74] not by works
[1203.74 → 1204.54] so that no one can boast.
[1204.62 → 1204.78] Alright.
[1205.38 → 1205.78] The end.
[1206.06 → 1206.28] Go.
[1206.56 → 1206.80] Live.
[1208.34 → 1209.12] You have to ask
[1209.12 → 1209.90] the follow-up question.
[1210.06 → 1211.06] For what purpose?
[1211.80 → 1212.90] What is the purpose
[1212.90 → 1214.30] of God saving us
[1214.30 → 1215.14] and calling us
[1215.14 → 1216.02] by His grace?
[1217.02 → 1217.58] Verse 10.
[1217.74 → 1218.38] He goes on.
[1219.32 → 1219.66] For
[1219.66 → 1221.82] we are God's handiwork
[1221.82 → 1223.74] created in Christ Jesus.
[1224.66 → 1225.64] For what purpose?
[1225.84 → 1227.58] To do good works
[1227.58 → 1229.18] which He prepared
[1229.18 → 1230.70] in advance for us to do.
[1231.80 → 1233.22] And then the yoke imagery,
[1233.36 → 1234.30] what Jesus is teaching us
[1234.30 → 1235.60] from our passage today
[1235.60 → 1238.18] is preparing us
[1238.18 → 1239.58] and equipping us
[1239.58 → 1240.34] for the good works
[1240.34 → 1241.04] He has prepared
[1241.04 → 1241.52] in advance
[1241.52 → 1242.44] for us to do.
[1243.92 → 1245.08] That's our last question.
[1245.34 → 1246.28] That's kind of the title
[1246.28 → 1246.74] of the sermon,
[1246.84 → 1247.18] isn't it?
[1247.92 → 1249.44] The yoke of Jesus.
[1249.56 → 1250.86] Putting on the yoke of Jesus.
[1251.08 → 1252.80] How exactly is it easy
[1252.80 → 1253.90] and is burdened light?
[1253.90 → 1254.54] How?
[1256.96 → 1258.28] Because our calling
[1258.28 → 1259.08] as disciples
[1259.08 → 1260.46] is to take on
[1260.46 → 1261.94] His yoke.
[1262.38 → 1263.08] That's the point.
[1264.98 → 1265.98] We are called
[1265.98 → 1267.36] to take on His yoke,
[1267.54 → 1268.46] not our own.
[1269.62 → 1270.16] Not
[1270.16 → 1271.92] trying to come up
[1271.92 → 1272.42] with the answers
[1272.42 → 1273.70] for every little thing
[1273.70 → 1274.36] in our lives.
[1274.80 → 1276.46] Jesus is not offering us
[1276.46 → 1276.92] some sort of
[1276.92 → 1277.98] self-help method
[1277.98 → 1279.18] to somehow make
[1279.18 → 1280.18] our own yokes
[1280.18 → 1281.16] easier and lighter.
[1281.98 → 1282.54] That's not what
[1282.54 → 1283.16] He's getting at.
[1283.16 → 1284.76] Jesus invites us
[1284.76 → 1285.24] to Him
[1285.24 → 1286.54] to take on
[1286.54 → 1287.52] His yoke.
[1288.98 → 1290.62] Because in Christ
[1290.62 → 1292.26] His yoke
[1292.26 → 1293.76] is to do good works.
[1294.60 → 1295.78] And God equips us
[1295.78 → 1296.80] for that good work.
[1301.00 → 1302.06] And that's kind of
[1302.06 → 1302.60] my answer
[1302.60 → 1304.14] for why Jesus uses
[1304.14 → 1305.70] a working tool
[1305.70 → 1307.20] for His message
[1307.20 → 1307.76] of comfort.
[1307.96 → 1308.58] Do you notice that?
[1309.56 → 1310.96] He uses a yoke,
[1311.14 → 1312.02] not a chair,
[1312.02 → 1313.02] not a bed,
[1313.30 → 1314.64] not a nice lawn chair
[1314.64 → 1315.14] or something.
[1315.70 → 1317.46] He's using a yoke
[1317.46 → 1318.48] for His message
[1318.48 → 1319.22] of comfort.
[1320.04 → 1320.60] Do you get it?
[1322.84 → 1324.28] Because He's showing us
[1324.28 → 1324.96] that obedience
[1324.96 → 1325.96] to His teachings,
[1326.24 → 1326.90] His yoke,
[1327.06 → 1328.38] to learn from Him,
[1328.50 → 1329.76] to give our whole lives
[1329.76 → 1330.10] to Him,
[1330.18 → 1331.08] to follow Him
[1331.08 → 1332.38] every step along the way,
[1332.82 → 1334.20] is to put on His yoke.
[1334.20 → 1335.92] and that yoke
[1335.92 → 1336.64] is easy.
[1337.64 → 1338.28] And His burden
[1338.28 → 1339.10] is light for us
[1339.10 → 1340.34] because it is the Lord
[1340.34 → 1341.40] of all creation
[1341.40 → 1342.38] that journeys
[1342.38 → 1343.34] with us.
[1344.62 → 1345.46] He's the one
[1345.46 → 1346.44] who equips us.
[1346.44 → 1350.76] Jesus' mission
[1350.76 → 1351.90] was to come
[1351.90 → 1352.94] and to restore
[1352.94 → 1353.66] and to heal
[1353.66 → 1355.96] a broken creation.
[1356.78 → 1358.06] And now He's inviting
[1358.06 → 1358.76] His people
[1358.76 → 1360.04] to take upon
[1360.04 → 1360.96] that yoke
[1360.96 → 1362.64] to join His mission
[1362.64 → 1363.64] of restoring
[1363.64 → 1364.22] and healing
[1364.22 → 1365.10] a broken world.
[1365.54 → 1366.44] That's the way
[1366.44 → 1367.54] to true life
[1367.54 → 1368.34] and
[1368.34 → 1370.22] that's the way
[1370.22 → 1370.90] to true
[1370.90 → 1372.38] Sabbath.
[1372.86 → 1373.68] I was going to say
[1373.68 → 1374.06] shalom.
[1375.14 → 1376.52] But true shalom
[1376.52 → 1377.64] and true Sabbath,
[1378.44 → 1379.30] true rest,
[1379.88 → 1380.46] refreshment
[1380.46 → 1381.34] for our souls.
[1384.10 → 1385.10] Many times
[1385.10 → 1385.88] this may seem
[1385.88 → 1387.04] like a daunting task.
[1388.04 → 1389.08] But Jesus says,
[1389.34 → 1389.84] come to me.
[1390.16 → 1391.50] It's a personal invitation.
[1396.12 → 1397.46] Jesus invites those
[1397.46 → 1398.10] who are weary
[1398.10 → 1398.90] and burdened,
[1398.92 → 1399.32] He says.
[1399.90 → 1401.02] Those who are having
[1401.02 → 1402.02] a hard time of it.
[1402.90 → 1403.54] Those for whom
[1403.54 → 1404.64] life is hard work
[1404.64 → 1406.20] and who feel overwhelmed.
[1407.28 → 1407.88] And then going
[1407.88 → 1408.70] a little deeper here.
[1409.54 → 1410.82] Jesus calls to Him
[1410.82 → 1412.16] those who are discouraged.
[1412.66 → 1413.44] Those who want
[1413.44 → 1413.92] to be good
[1413.92 → 1414.92] to please God.
[1415.84 → 1416.42] To love
[1416.42 → 1417.28] and serve others.
[1417.62 → 1418.72] To join His mission
[1418.72 → 1419.60] of restoration.
[1420.12 → 1420.52] But,
[1420.68 → 1421.62] many times,
[1421.92 → 1423.10] feel quite selfish.
[1424.08 → 1424.98] Quite uncut
[1424.98 → 1425.70] to the task.
[1426.56 → 1427.50] Quite inadequate.
[1428.58 → 1429.40] And even feel
[1429.40 → 1430.06] like failures.
[1430.06 → 1433.58] And so,
[1433.72 → 1434.72] to those burdened
[1434.72 → 1435.48] with this guilt
[1435.48 → 1436.34] and inadequacy,
[1437.00 → 1438.18] Jesus now appears
[1438.18 → 1438.80] and promises,
[1439.02 → 1439.60] first,
[1439.94 → 1440.54] refreshment.
[1440.66 → 1440.90] Yes.
[1441.36 → 1441.74] Comfort.
[1442.02 → 1443.10] Rest for our souls.
[1443.96 → 1445.08] But also equipment.
[1445.98 → 1447.12] He equips us.
[1448.26 → 1449.46] It is the living presence
[1449.46 → 1450.62] of God in us
[1450.62 → 1451.76] that equips us
[1451.76 → 1452.58] for every good work.
[1452.58 → 1454.60] To face the day-to-day tasks
[1454.60 → 1455.90] that seem too daunting
[1455.90 → 1456.48] at times.
[1456.48 → 1457.82] We take on the yoke
[1457.82 → 1458.62] of our Lord Jesus
[1458.62 → 1459.82] becoming a witness
[1459.82 → 1462.32] to His work of healing.
[1462.46 → 1463.40] Not our work,
[1463.66 → 1465.02] but His work of healing.
[1465.34 → 1466.64] And we participate in that.
[1467.24 → 1468.22] His work of healing
[1468.22 → 1469.16] for a broken,
[1469.64 → 1470.72] sin-filled world
[1470.72 → 1471.72] even in our,
[1472.26 → 1473.16] or maybe even
[1473.16 → 1473.88] especially
[1473.88 → 1475.32] in our workplaces.
[1476.82 → 1477.98] Maybe especially
[1477.98 → 1478.98] when our co-workers
[1478.98 → 1479.82] are being jerks.
[1480.00 → 1480.60] I'm not talking
[1480.60 → 1481.28] about our church.
[1481.68 → 1482.98] I have great co-workers.
[1483.18 → 1483.86] I'll just say that.
[1483.86 → 1487.08] Even when the work
[1487.08 → 1488.22] environment is toxic.
[1489.38 → 1490.76] That's a common story
[1490.76 → 1491.66] I hear from young adults
[1491.66 → 1492.56] all the time.
[1493.34 → 1494.56] Wherever they end up working,
[1495.12 → 1496.22] wherever they try
[1496.22 → 1496.82] to be a light
[1496.82 → 1497.42] for the world,
[1498.36 → 1499.24] it's toxic.
[1499.76 → 1501.24] It's counter-cultural
[1501.24 → 1502.22] to live as a Christian.
[1503.98 → 1505.26] It is the right way
[1505.26 → 1506.76] and it's the hard work
[1506.76 → 1507.84] of living the way
[1507.84 → 1508.34] of blessing.
[1508.96 → 1509.40] But again,
[1509.54 → 1510.26] good news, hope.
[1510.76 → 1511.62] It is the Lord
[1511.62 → 1512.44] of all creation.
[1512.44 → 1514.10] Jesus,
[1514.36 → 1515.56] who has all authority
[1515.56 → 1516.38] in His hands,
[1517.00 → 1517.86] He's the one
[1517.86 → 1519.00] who journeys with you
[1519.00 → 1520.16] right along the way
[1520.16 → 1520.98] and He's the one
[1520.98 → 1521.84] who provides
[1521.84 → 1523.08] real rest.
[1524.86 → 1525.74] And I'll end with this.
[1526.64 → 1527.48] Try to remember
[1527.48 → 1527.90] that image
[1527.90 → 1528.60] of the yoke again.
[1529.00 → 1529.14] Right?
[1529.94 → 1530.46] Usually,
[1530.70 → 1531.24] a yoke
[1531.24 → 1532.30] implies
[1532.30 → 1533.40] two oxen
[1533.40 → 1534.34] pulling the cart.
[1535.18 → 1536.12] It is not one.
[1536.86 → 1537.76] Jesus isn't creating
[1537.76 → 1538.88] a singular yoke
[1538.88 → 1539.24] and saying,
[1539.34 → 1539.90] alright, pull.
[1540.86 → 1541.62] I'll be there.
[1542.44 → 1543.10] The yoke
[1543.10 → 1543.92] has two.
[1544.56 → 1544.84] Jesus,
[1545.00 → 1545.36] the image
[1545.36 → 1546.08] that we should be getting
[1546.08 → 1547.00] is Jesus walking
[1547.00 → 1548.24] right along with us,
[1548.52 → 1549.54] pulling that cart together,
[1549.78 → 1550.50] living the way
[1550.50 → 1551.08] of blessing
[1551.08 → 1552.14] to flourish,
[1552.46 → 1553.16] to be a light
[1553.16 → 1553.72] for the world.
[1555.00 → 1556.22] So blessed are you
[1556.22 → 1557.28] who are poor
[1557.28 → 1557.80] in spirit,
[1558.36 → 1559.30] those who put on
[1559.30 → 1560.04] the yoke of Christ,
[1560.28 → 1561.66] for you will be comforted
[1561.66 → 1562.82] and by God's Spirit
[1562.82 → 1563.46] equipped
[1563.46 → 1564.76] to do good works.
[1565.00 → 1565.78] And so just like
[1565.78 → 1566.28] the psalmist,
[1566.36 → 1566.94] we can say,
[1568.00 → 1568.90] the famous psalm,
[1569.18 → 1569.78] Psalm 23,
[1569.78 → 1570.84] the Lord
[1570.84 → 1571.84] is my shepherd.
[1571.84 → 1573.30] I lack nothing.
[1574.92 → 1576.06] The Lord
[1576.06 → 1576.78] is my shepherd.
[1576.90 → 1577.34] Not me.
[1578.12 → 1578.64] The Lord
[1578.64 → 1579.64] is my shepherd.
[1580.36 → 1581.26] He leads me
[1581.26 → 1582.40] beside quiet waters.
[1583.80 → 1585.14] He refreshes
[1585.14 → 1585.78] my soul.
[1586.98 → 1587.20] Amen.
[1587.94 → 1588.42] Amen.
[1588.88 → 1589.40] Let's pray.
[1589.40 → 1590.40] Amen.
[1590.40 → 1590.76] Amen.
[1595.26 → 1596.20] Loving Father,
[1596.32 → 1597.52] we come before you
[1597.52 → 1599.76] and we give you thanks
[1599.76 → 1601.06] and we praise your name
[1601.06 → 1603.50] for you oppose the proud
[1603.50 → 1605.78] and you call the weak
[1605.78 → 1606.44] and the humble
[1606.44 → 1607.40] to your love.
[1609.74 → 1611.24] But I also pray, Lord,
[1611.72 → 1612.86] forgive us for the times
[1612.86 → 1613.92] when we were proud.
[1615.12 → 1616.16] Forgive us for the times
[1616.16 → 1616.80] when we thought
[1616.80 → 1617.90] we had it all figured out,
[1617.90 → 1620.20] that we can live
[1620.20 → 1620.84] without you.
[1622.36 → 1623.22] You call us
[1623.22 → 1624.36] to be disciples, Lord.
[1625.56 → 1626.24] And that's what
[1626.24 → 1626.90] we want to do.
[1628.04 → 1628.82] Help us
[1628.82 → 1630.02] in our time of need.
[1630.90 → 1631.58] Humble us
[1631.58 → 1632.92] in our time of pride.
[1634.60 → 1635.34] Help us
[1635.34 → 1636.02] to depend
[1636.02 → 1637.46] and lean on you
[1637.46 → 1641.58] to truly live
[1641.58 → 1642.18] and confess
[1642.18 → 1643.82] that you are
[1643.82 → 1644.98] our only source
[1644.98 → 1645.66] of comfort
[1645.66 → 1646.62] and healing
[1646.62 → 1648.14] and rest.
[1649.26 → 1649.80] We thank you
[1649.80 → 1650.28] for this
[1650.28 → 1651.32] and I pray a blessing
[1651.32 → 1653.44] over all of our workplaces
[1653.44 → 1654.40] as we head
[1654.40 → 1655.52] into a new fall season
[1655.52 → 1656.76] that you're blessing
[1656.76 → 1657.56] and you're equipping
[1657.56 → 1658.60] by your spirit
[1658.60 → 1659.42] would be with us
[1659.42 → 1660.48] every step along the way.
[1661.60 → 1662.14] We thank you
[1662.14 → 1663.10] for this good news
[1663.10 → 1664.70] and in your holy,
[1665.04 → 1665.32] precious name
[1665.32 → 1665.70] we pray.
[1666.52 → 1666.82] Amen.
[1666.82 → 1666.94] Amen.
[1669.82 → 1670.66] At this time,
[1670.76 → 1671.42] I'm going to invite
[1671.42 → 1672.60] the worship team
[1672.60 → 1673.32] up to the stage
[1673.32 → 1674.30] as we turn
[1674.30 → 1675.00] to the table
[1675.00 → 1676.00] and we share
[1676.00 → 1676.94] in communion together.
[1676.94 → 1677.06] Amen.
