[310.50 → 313.22] good morning I'm Tim and I belong to Lisa here
[313.22 → 323.38] we uh we were happily part of a church for many years in the north surrey Guilford Fleetwood
[323.38 → 333.46] area and much to our sorrow that church declined and finally ended up closing its doors and I had
[333.46 → 340.42] sometimes noticed this building as I was driving along Fraser highway at times and I thought I should
[340.42 → 344.98] just check it out a little more and I checked the website and when we started visiting other churches
[345.62 → 350.50] with a view to you know recommitting somewhere else we thought we should visit this one
[351.54 → 357.14] and we loved it when we first came and then when we came back a number of weeks later even more so
[358.10 → 363.86] I'm very grateful for the church's sense of community in the congregation and in the Clayton heights
[363.86 → 370.26] area and in a sense of responsibility to share the gospel to the global community at large and
[370.42 → 380.74] uh we're very, very grateful for the church uh yes exactly um I grew up in the church so my church family
[380.74 → 388.74] is very, very important to me uh the first Sunday that we were here I was greeted by a child and i
[388.74 → 395.54] noticed all the children it was a growing and healthy church and um the second Sunday I was here
[395.54 → 402.82] i I realized when we were singing I wasn't just singing myself I was worshipping with you and that

[473.46 → 479.22] now that was at Latimer road, and so we were there for about four years uh whereupon I took a call to
[479.22 → 485.62] Willoughby Christian reform church served there for eight years and then um after that call ended I ended

[526.58 → 531.30] years ago god called me to be the director of church planting for the Christian reform church
[531.30 → 536.90] and for resonate global mission, and it's just been a joy to see what god's doing in his church around
[536.90 → 543.62] the world starting new churches thousands and thousands of people coming to know Jesus and as
[543.62 → 549.78] we've started attending here we started to see god doing great things here as well and so it's just a
[549.78 → 554.18] delight to join and be part of this community and join the mission that god's called us to do together

[627.14 → 633.86] and we're blessed with six grandchildren with one more coming in April our stories are very similar
[634.74 → 640.18] both of us were brought up in Christian home we both went to Christian schools, and we were involved
[640.18 → 647.06] in many church activities as we grew up and throughout our marriage through our lives our personal
[647.06 → 653.30] relationships with Jesus have continued to grow as we have experienced god's hand working in and guiding
[653.30 → 660.90] our lives, and we've always seen his faithfulness throughout in other words for us there was no aha moment
[661.70 → 670.34] but continued growth and dependence and trust in god we've been members of new CRC all of our lives
[670.34 → 677.30] over the past several years we have felt that god has been calling us to make a change we began attending
[677.30 → 687.06] here in december 2022, and immediately we felt very welcome we both said to each other this feels like
[687.06 → 692.58] home we are very happy and blessed to be part of this church community, and we're excited to see what
[692.58 → 706.34] what it holds in store for us as we continue to grow here hello everyone he's a little bit shy my name is Germain
[707.22 → 715.06] this is my firstborn son Kenny prime and I also have a little baby his name is Levi and
[715.06 → 724.34] um we've been going to this church for over a year and the first time we came here we're very happy we
[724.34 → 733.06] felt welcome we felt like we belong we felt accepted so we are now very happy that we are officially a
[733.06 → 734.58] member of this church thank you
[737.30 → 743.14] I think I'm gonna hide behind Charmaine too uh i kind of thought Dave sometimes that's the old switcheroo and
[743.14 → 746.58] he goes I'll start at the other end and I was going please do that so I don't have to be the last
[746.58 → 753.86] guy to talk uh my name is Mark ANSIs my wife carry uh we started here about a year and a half ago and
[753.86 → 761.70] uh we every time we went out to the truck I said to her, I like this church better every Sunday and uh
[762.58 → 768.34] we just thought we would like to make this our home um we both were involved before covet in a really
[768.34 → 773.06] huge church, and it just felt I don't know it just felt like we needed something different and we
[773.06 → 776.42] feel like we found that here you can hold on
[779.62 → 785.38] well joining a church is no small decision it's a huge decision and hopefully in our membership class
[785.38 → 789.38] I underscored that point that among the many things that we talked about the biblical story
[789.38 → 794.58] how to be faithful as Christians in our culture how to follow Jesus as part of a community and bear
[794.58 → 799.94] witness to Jesus in our city those are huge things but a thread that wove its way through our conversation
[799.94 → 804.82] I think was the thread of commitment in an age where people do not like necessarily to make
[804.82 → 809.94] commitments today you're making a commitment to how you're going to be discipled to how your kids are
[809.94 → 814.74] going to be formed to the person and the people we are going to become together as the body of Christ
[814.74 → 820.90] and you're making a commitment to do that in this family of faith four things that we said in every
[820.90 → 825.86] membership class I'm just going to recite them I bet you remember them perfectly but at least four
[825.86 → 830.26] things that we're saying this morning when we join the church number one you're saying I'm committed
[830.26 → 835.78] to submitting to the teaching and the preaching and the leadership of this church we're committed to
[835.78 → 841.86] being discipled in the way of Jesus in this church we're committed to using our gifts to serving this
[841.86 → 847.70] church and community with our time our treasure and our talent, and finally we're committed to participating
[847.70 → 853.38] in the mission to bear witness to Jesus in our city that's what membership is about so you're making a
[853.38 → 860.26] big commitment, and we are delighted that we get to do this together I'm going to ask four questions
[860.26 → 864.98] of everyone here and mark starting with you uh we'll just move our way through those who are joining
[864.98 → 869.30] the church I'll ask for and at the end you can say I will god helping me or if your family you can say we
[869.30 → 875.86] will god helping me first question is this do you love Jesus Christ do you want to make following
[875.86 → 881.86] him the goal of the rest of your life do you trust him as the one who saves you from sin and with repentance
[881.86 → 889.54] and joy embrace him as the lord of your life second do you believe that the bible is god's word it's the
[889.54 → 898.50] true story of the whole world revealing Christ and his purposes for all of us third do you promise to do
[898.50 → 904.26] all that you can in the strength of the Holy Spirit to strengthen your love and commitment to the church
[904.26 → 910.34] by faithfully sharing in the life of this community honouring and serving those around you
[912.18 → 919.22] finally will you commit to growing in your faith devoting yourselves to the practices and disciplines
[919.22 → 925.62] that foster our life in Christ seeking to use all the gifts god has given you to serve his kingdom
[925.62 → 934.50] in this community and in this city mark what is your answer yeah I do I will god helping me thank you

[1097.30 → 1098.50] serving one another
[1099.14 → 1100.58] giving to those in need
[1101.30 → 1103.70] following the way of Christ
[1104.98 → 1106.66] bless our friends' oh god
[1107.54 → 1111.62] and let us be a blessing to them in your holy name amen
[1111.62 → 1127.54] would you join me in welcoming for the first time our home members
[1134.26 → 1139.70] so I'm not letting one family sit down because we still have good work to do here as we welcome
[1139.70 → 1143.22] the knee family come over here you guys are way too far away
[1147.38 → 1153.94] so as you heard this is bay you can see this is yen and this is scarlet who's hiding behind her dad
[1155.22 → 1159.86] and as they joined our church um as they went to the membership class really there was ongoing
[1159.86 → 1164.34] conversation about baptism uh yen came to faith 10 15 years ago now
[1164.34 → 1171.78] 15 years and bay uh has been listening wrestling learning and in the membership class he's like no
[1171.78 → 1175.86] I want to be baptized and I want Scarlett to be baptized with me so today is really
[1175.86 → 1179.62] god's faithfulness over many years and I won't give your testimony for you but I will say this
[1180.74 → 1183.06] baptism is fundamentally about belonging
[1183.94 → 1188.18] you are joining the family of Christ today you've made commitments already as a member, and now you're
[1188.18 → 1194.66] joining as someone who's going under the water of baptism it's a sign of your sins being washed away
[1194.66 → 1199.70] in fact when we do immersion I just love the symbolism of you die with Christ your old self
[1199.70 → 1205.38] goes under the water with him, and you rise in his resurrection, and we really believe that as you join
[1205.38 → 1211.14] this church the spirit of the living god is going to be at work in you and your family to form and deepen
[1211.14 → 1219.78] and strengthen your faith to follow Jesus I'm going to read a passage from Romans 6 one of my favourites
[1219.78 → 1225.54] probably on baptism this is what Paul says to the church we were buried with him that is Jesus through
[1225.54 → 1232.90] baptism in death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead to the glory of the father we too
[1232.90 → 1240.10] might live a new life for if we have been united to Jesus in a death like his we will also certainly be
[1240.10 → 1246.98] united to Jesus in a resurrection like his for we know that our old self was crucified with him
[1246.98 → 1252.10] so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with so that we should no longer be slaves to sin
[1252.66 → 1259.94] because anyone who has died has been set free from sin what we're going to do now is something that
[1259.94 → 1264.98] has been done in the church throughout the generations we're going to recite what is called the apostles
[1264.98 → 1268.50] creed, and maybe you grew up with this maybe you didn't but I just want to say
[1268.50 → 1275.54] this is one of the few documents that unifies the church around the globe and perhaps more
[1275.54 → 1281.46] importantly for this morning in its earliest form it was training people in baptism this was a
[1281.46 → 1285.70] confession of faith that said I believe in Jesus I want to receive the life of Christ and I'm going
[1285.70 → 1291.30] to receive baptism so as uh you know jib bi and Scarlett received baptism I thought it would be appropriate
[1291.30 → 1296.98] for us as a community of faith to recite words that Christians for generations have lived by and many have
[1296.98 → 1303.14] died for about whom Jesus is so let's recite this together I believe in god the father
[1304.42 → 1310.02] creative heaven and earth I believe in Jesus Christ his only son
[1310.02 → 1319.46] my lord who was conceived by the Holy Spirit born with prayer to Mary I suffered under Pontius Pilate
[1319.46 → 1322.02] was crucified
[1322.02 → 1335.46] Television
[1335.46 → 1337.62] to judge the living and the dead.
[1338.44 → 1340.38] I believe in the Holy Spirit,
[1340.96 → 1342.60] the Holy Catholic Church,
[1343.16 → 1344.50] the communion of saints,
[1345.04 → 1346.54] the forgiveness of sins,
[1347.06 → 1348.68] the resurrection of the body,
[1349.22 → 1350.86] and the life of the last few.
[1351.34 → 1351.64] Amen.
[1353.64 → 1355.40] Well, Ji bay, I'll invite you now
[1355.40 → 1356.64] to share your own testimony.
[1357.54 → 1358.90] And after that, we're going to baptize
[1358.90 → 1360.00] both you and Scarlett.
[1365.46 → 1368.96] So my initial encounter with God
[1368.96 → 1371.44] occurred when I was about 10 years old.
[1372.54 → 1374.14] It happened during a time
[1374.14 → 1376.54] when one of my aunts returned from Russia
[1376.54 → 1379.66] and brought a lump of pocket-sized Chinese Bibles
[1379.66 → 1380.86] to my grandpa's home,
[1381.64 → 1384.12] offering them to anyone interested.
[1384.94 → 1388.12] I was immediately drawn to this little book
[1388.12 → 1391.10] and asked my dad if I could have a copy.
[1392.30 → 1393.96] He admittedly refused,
[1393.96 → 1396.86] viewed in the Bible as superstitious
[1396.86 → 1398.64] and unsuitable for children,
[1399.66 → 1401.96] given his upbringing during China's
[1402.72 → 1404.74] tumultuous Cultural Revolution.
[1406.40 → 1409.70] Undeterred, I discreetly acquired a copy
[1409.70 → 1412.44] and kept it hidden in my nightstand drawer.
[1413.78 → 1416.52] It is not an easy book for a kid
[1416.52 → 1418.58] and even to me nowadays.
[1418.58 → 1422.22] I still read quite a bit of it.
[1422.74 → 1423.52] To this day,
[1424.44 → 1426.74] the Bible remains at my parents' house in China,
[1427.54 → 1428.78] a silent testament
[1428.78 → 1431.18] to the early starting of my faith.
[1432.32 → 1433.30] In my heart,
[1433.84 → 1435.60] I knew I believed in God.
[1436.18 → 1437.34] I prayed and pounded
[1437.34 → 1439.12] what God would want me to do.
[1439.50 → 1442.14] But all of this remained my secret.
[1442.14 → 1446.10] I was uncertain whether it was even permissible
[1446.10 → 1449.22] to openly express these beliefs.
[1449.98 → 1452.68] That is, until I met my wife.
[1454.56 → 1457.30] She had been my high school crush,
[1458.26 → 1461.52] and Destiny brought us together 15 years later.
[1462.60 → 1464.40] She was a member of local church,
[1464.40 → 1466.68] and as we grew closer,
[1467.54 → 1469.78] I began attending church with her.
[1470.22 → 1471.26] Going to church with her
[1471.26 → 1474.52] has been a transformative experience for me.
[1475.28 → 1477.70] Her unwavering faith and guidance
[1477.70 → 1479.66] have opened a new chapter in my life
[1479.66 → 1481.86] as I began to know Jesus Christ
[1481.86 → 1483.34] on a deeper level.
[1484.12 → 1485.32] Going to church together
[1485.32 → 1488.18] has not only strengthened our relationship,
[1488.94 → 1491.04] but also enriched my spiritual growth
[1491.04 → 1494.40] and understanding of the profound message
[1494.40 → 1496.20] of Christ's love and grace.
[1496.96 → 1499.74] We eventually married in that very church.
[1500.56 → 1502.40] It feels like an incredible miracle,
[1503.26 → 1504.92] a blessing that I believe
[1504.92 → 1508.04] Jesus has graciously shone upon us.
[1509.62 → 1511.02] After our marriage,
[1511.64 → 1514.28] I truly felt Jesus guiding our journey
[1514.28 → 1517.90] as we made a life-authoring decision
[1517.90 → 1518.80] to move to Canada.
[1518.80 → 1521.62] Initially settling in Quebec,
[1522.34 → 1525.06] we embarked on a new chapter of our lives
[1525.06 → 1527.12] filled with uncertainty and excitement.
[1527.84 → 1529.20] The challenges we faced
[1529.20 → 1531.56] and experiences we gained
[1531.56 → 1533.20] during those years in Quebec
[1533.20 → 1535.54] were invaluable in shaping our growth
[1535.54 → 1536.60] as a family.
[1537.94 → 1538.86] Seven years later,
[1540.00 → 1541.64] with the unwavering faith
[1541.64 → 1543.62] and the belief that Jesus
[1543.62 → 1545.10] was guiding our steps,
[1545.62 → 1546.54] we made the decision
[1546.54 → 1548.16] to relocate to British Columbia.
[1548.80 → 1550.60] This move marks
[1550.60 → 1553.82] a significant milestone in our journey,
[1554.48 → 1556.22] bringing us closer to our dreams
[1556.22 → 1557.84] and aspirations.
[1558.84 → 1559.88] Looking back,
[1560.60 → 1561.64] I'm filled with gratitude
[1561.64 → 1563.66] for the guidance and the strength
[1563.66 → 1565.54] that Jesus had provided us
[1565.54 → 1567.62] throughout this incredible adventure
[1567.62 → 1568.88] in the new land.
[1569.86 → 1571.24] I've come to believe
[1571.24 → 1574.30] that every pivotal moment in my life
[1574.30 → 1576.34] has been more than just mere coincidence.
[1576.34 → 1580.02] It's been a profound demonstration
[1580.02 → 1581.60] of Jesus guiding my path.
[1582.34 → 1583.64] From chance meetings
[1583.64 → 1585.80] to life-altering decisions,
[1586.44 → 1590.04] each juncture has felt like a divine epiphany,
[1590.70 → 1592.42] steering me in the right direction.
[1593.20 → 1595.84] These moments have reaffirmed my faith
[1595.84 → 1597.34] and deepened my understanding
[1597.34 → 1600.34] that Jesus plays an intricate role
[1600.34 → 1601.42] in my life's journey.
[1601.42 → 1604.52] It's as if he's constantly
[1604.52 → 1605.04] whispering and whispering
[1605.04 → 1606.40] and whispering into my heart,
[1607.10 → 1608.34] guiding me toward purpose,
[1608.74 → 1609.06] growth,
[1609.46 → 1611.28] and a greater sense of purpose.
[1611.84 → 1613.06] Through these experiences,
[1613.64 → 1615.74] I've learned to trust his divine plan,
[1616.14 → 1619.02] finding solace in the knowledge
[1619.02 → 1621.56] that his presence is always there
[1621.56 → 1623.06] to illuminate the way.
[1623.06 → 1626.00] Following his guidance,
[1626.40 → 1627.68] we walked through the door
[1627.68 → 1629.14] of Hope Community Church.
[1629.78 → 1630.60] It felt like home
[1630.60 → 1632.00] from the very first moment.
[1633.26 → 1635.12] Although newcomers to the congregation,
[1635.80 → 1637.46] I've already gained profound insight
[1637.46 → 1638.36] into the Bible
[1638.36 → 1640.52] and dipped in my faith in God.
[1641.32 → 1643.14] Along this remarkable journey
[1643.14 → 1644.40] to where I stand today,
[1645.36 → 1647.30] I've encountered numerous individuals
[1647.30 → 1650.14] who have provided invaluable assistance,
[1650.14 → 1652.74] while some might chalk it up to luck,
[1653.66 → 1655.40] but I know now,
[1655.94 → 1657.08] and I understand that
[1657.08 → 1659.32] they are angels sent by God to guide me,
[1659.92 → 1660.86] much like my wife.
[1662.32 → 1665.42] Today marks a significant,
[1665.62 → 1667.34] endurance chapter in our lives
[1667.34 → 1669.42] as my daughter, Scarlett,
[1669.98 → 1672.58] and I embrace the sacred rite of baptism,
[1673.30 → 1674.32] affirming our faith
[1674.32 → 1676.28] and spiritual journey together.
[1677.38 → 1678.28] My daughter, Scarlett,
[1678.28 → 1682.10] her presence has been a beacon of light,
[1682.56 → 1684.64] guiding me through life's complexities
[1684.64 → 1686.68] with her innocence and joy.
[1687.80 → 1689.78] Today, as we stand together,
[1690.56 → 1693.02] ready to renew our commitment to our faith,
[1693.72 → 1695.64] I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
[1695.64 → 1697.46] for this blessing,
[1698.22 → 1699.86] cherishing every moment of guidance,
[1700.38 → 1702.34] learning, and unconditional love
[1702.34 → 1703.48] that we share.
[1704.12 → 1705.24] We believe in Jesus.
[1705.24 → 1707.34] He's our Lord and Saviour.
[1707.34 → 1710.52] I want to follow Him for the rest of my life.
[1711.36 → 1712.66] It is for this reason
[1712.66 → 1714.82] that we want to receive baptism
[1714.82 → 1716.58] and join this church family.
[1717.30 → 1717.94] Thank you.
[1719.54 → 1720.14] Applause
[1720.14 → 1729.88] Scarlett didn't want to share,
[1730.02 → 1730.94] but I just want to share
[1730.94 → 1733.12] that I had a sit-down with Scarlett
[1733.12 → 1734.28] just to talk about faith
[1734.28 → 1735.64] and her belief,
[1735.78 → 1736.40] and it was a delight
[1736.40 → 1737.64] just to hear her nod and say,
[1737.72 → 1738.60] that's what I believe.
[1739.06 → 1740.04] And so it is a delight
[1740.04 → 1741.62] to baptize you, Ji bay,
[1741.70 → 1743.54] and then I will also baptize you, Scarlett.
[1743.60 → 1745.18] So come with me over to the tub.
[1745.18 → 1753.06] We're going to baptize Ji bay first.
[1753.06 → 1776.08] Ji bay,
[1776.16 → 1779.16] I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[1780.00 → 1780.58] the Son,
[1780.58 → 1782.12] and the Holy Spirit.
[1782.12 → 1783.32] Applause
[1783.32 → 1813.30] Thank you.
[1813.32 → 1843.30] Thank you.
[1843.32 → 1873.30] Thank you.
[1873.32 → 1903.30] Thank you.
[1903.32 → 1908.06] Father God, we come before you today, and we celebrate your goodness and your love.
[1908.66 → 1919.42] We thank you so much for the testimony that was shared today to remind us too of where we were and where we have come to by your grace.
[1919.70 → 1922.04] We thank you for this wonderful family, Lord.
[1922.04 → 1948.92] We thank you for your guidance and your love all throughout their lives, even in the midst of keeping his faith, having to keep his faith secret, that you have continued to guide him in his heart, that you have sent so many people throughout his life and this family's life to always know and come and journey toward the truth and how you love them and how you are their loving father and their saviour and their creator.
[1948.92 → 1960.04] So we thank you for this family. We pray a blessing on them. Thank you for this journey that they will continue to take in commitment to you, their true Lord and saviour.
[1960.04 → 1974.48] Dear Lord, we come before you with gratitude and joy.
[1974.48 → 1983.16] And what a beautiful day that we get to this beautiful family baptized and decided to follow Jesus, Lord.
[1983.16 → 1984.16] Thank you, Lord.
[1984.16 → 1985.16] Thank you, Lord.
[1985.16 → 2008.82] Thank you, Heavenly Father. Thank you, glorious God. Thank you for this great journey.
[2008.82 → 2009.82] Thank you, Heavenly Father.
[2009.82 → 2012.82] You made this possible, and we say thank you.
[2012.82 → 2019.46] Father, I pray for this family this morning that they will have no reason to regret following you.
[2019.46 → 2024.10] I pray that in every storm of life, you will be there for them.
[2024.10 → 2026.84] You will guide their heart. You will lead their steps.
[2026.84 → 2031.74] Lord, I pray that your glorious light will shine in their life.
[2031.74 → 2034.54] Lord, I say thank you.
[2035.62 → 2037.54] Your good news cannot be suppressed.
[2037.54 → 2044.88] I pray that as they continue to yield to your word that their lives will not be suppressed.
[2044.88 → 2047.68] Their lives will not be oppressed.
[2047.68 → 2051.66] Your grace will speak for them always.
[2051.66 → 2053.58] Thank you, Jesus.
[2053.58 → 2054.46] Amen.
[2054.46 → 2066.14] Dear Lord, what a beautiful thing to witness a family coming to you, becoming members here.
[2066.14 → 2068.48] It is not a coincidence, Lord.
[2068.48 → 2070.48] Nothing is a coincidence.
[2070.48 → 2080.28] It is your Holy Spirit that brings people here, that makes them feel part of such a beautiful family.
[2080.28 → 2082.42] You are our Father.
[2082.42 → 2088.76] You bring people together that come from different stories, different paths, different countries.
[2088.76 → 2097.56] But you bring them together to be brothers and sisters in Christ to your beautiful church, to your beautiful home.
[2097.56 → 2102.90] Yes, this is a building, but it is far greater than this building.
[2102.90 → 2110.90] This church offers a beautiful connection in sister ship, brother ship.
[2110.90 → 2113.24] And I ask that you bless this family.
[2113.24 → 2114.24] Bless their journey.
[2114.24 → 2115.24] Bless their journey.
[2115.24 → 2120.38] And just have them be the light, be the beacon to bring others to this church.
[2120.38 → 2124.44] To be, to just have, share their testimony, Lord.
[2124.44 → 2128.62] And I put a covering over them, and I bind Satan.
[2128.62 → 2130.78] And I ask you to bless them.
[2130.78 → 2137.92] Father, we pray over the future.
[2137.92 → 2147.80] We pray that you would use them for your kingdom, and that they would be strengthened by your word, by prayer, by fellowship in the breaking of bread.
[2147.80 → 2153.28] And that they would, in their ordinary lives, bear witness to the love of Jesus Christ for his world.
[2153.28 → 2155.00] We pray this in your mighty name.
[2155.00 → 2156.00] Amen.
[2156.00 → 2157.00] Amen.
[2157.00 → 2158.00] Congratulations.
[2158.00 → 2162.28] Now, let's welcome our newest baptized members.
[2162.28 → 2163.28] Thank you.
[2163.28 → 2165.28] Thank you.
[2165.28 → 2166.28] Thank you.
[2166.28 → 2167.28] Thank you.
[2167.28 → 2168.28] Thank you.
[2168.28 → 2169.28] Thank you.
[2169.28 → 2170.28] Thank you.
[2170.28 → 2171.28] Thank you.
[2171.28 → 2172.28] Thank you.
[2172.28 → 2173.28] Thank you.
[2173.28 → 2174.28] Thank you.
[2174.28 → 2175.28] Thank you.
[2175.28 → 2176.28] Thank you.
[2176.28 → 2177.28] Thank you.
[2177.28 → 2178.56] I heard about the Bible and your story.
[2178.56 → 2182.20] I thought it would be fitting to give you a Bible you do not need to hide.
[2182.20 → 2187.04] A Bible that we hope you journal through, that you can learn together as a family.
[2187.04 → 2188.04] And so this is the gift.
[2188.04 → 2194.28] There's also a certificate of baptism and a card from our leadership, both for you and also for you, Scarlett.
[2194.28 → 2198.24] And I just want you to know that we're going to give you photos of this event.
[2198.24 → 2199.24] Maddie has taken photos.
[2199.24 → 2204.16] And we want you to frame those photos in your house as a way of remembering and celebrating this Miles Hill for your family.
[2204.16 → 2205.16] So congratulations.
[2205.16 → 2206.16] Thank you.
[2206.16 → 2209.08] We're going to sing a song of celebration.
[2209.08 → 2212.64] We thought it would be fitting to finish this whole section by singing a song of doxology.
[2212.64 → 2213.64] Oh, praise the name.
[2213.64 → 2214.92] So let's stand and sing together.
[2214.92 → 2222.40] I cast my mind to Calvary.
[2222.40 → 2239.00] I cast my mind to Calvary, where Jesus bled and died for me.
[2239.00 → 2252.28] I see his wounds, his hands, his feet, my Saviour on that cursed tree.
[2252.28 → 2262.76] His body bound and drenched in tears.
[2262.76 → 2269.24] They laid him down in Joseph's tomb.
[2269.24 → 2276.12] The entrance sealed by heavy stone.
[2276.12 → 2282.24] Messiah still and all alone.
[2282.24 → 2293.72] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[2293.72 → 2299.72] Oh, praise his name forevermore.
[2299.72 → 2306.20] For endless days we will sing your praise.
[2306.20 → 2312.20] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[2312.20 → 2316.68] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[2316.68 → 2329.02] Then on the third, at break of dawn, the Son of Heaven rose again.
[2329.02 → 2335.50] Oh, trampled death, where is your sting?
[2335.50 → 2343.50] The angels roar for Christ the King.
[2343.50 → 2352.50] Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.
[2352.50 → 2358.98] Oh, praise his name forevermore.
[2358.98 → 2365.98] For endless days we will sing your praise.
[2365.98 → 2374.98] Oh, Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[2374.98 → 2380.98] When Christ shall come, his world to claim,
[2380.98 → 2388.46] Rulers shall bow at his great name.
[2388.46 → 2394.46] All tears shall end, all darkness cease,
[2394.46 → 2402.46] And he shall reign, our Prince of Peace.
[2402.46 → 2412.94] O praise the name of the Lord our God.
[2412.94 → 2418.94] O praise his name forevermore.
[2418.94 → 2424.94] For endless days we will sing your praise.
[2424.94 → 2430.42] O Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[2430.42 → 2437.42] O praise the name of the Lord our God.
[2437.42 → 2444.42] O praise his name forevermore.
[2444.42 → 2450.90] For endless days we will sing your praise.
[2450.90 → 2456.90] O Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[2456.90 → 2463.90] O Lord, oh, Lord our God.
[2463.90 → 2468.38] O praise the name of the Lord our God.
[2468.38 → 2470.38] You may be seated.
[2470.38 → 2473.38] Kids age three to grade three are invited to Sunday school,
[2473.38 → 2486.86] and we have launched today as well.
[2486.86 → 2501.74] Good afternoon, Hope.
[2501.74 → 2509.22] I just can't help but smile at this point.
[2509.22 → 2510.22] Yeah.
[2510.22 → 2515.22] It's just a wonderful display where we get to welcome,
[2515.22 → 2519.22] and we get to reflect on what it means to be the family of God.
[2519.22 → 2521.22] And we're rooted in God's word.
[2521.22 → 2529.22] We're the family of God because God's word, Jesus Christ, and his Holy Spirit have guided us into this family.
[2529.22 → 2539.70] And so I will try my best to go and witness faithfully to the word that we have today, which is from Galatians 4.
[2539.70 → 2548.70] And so thinking about the family of God, it's really hard to follow up such a beautiful image of how we welcome new members into our family,
[2548.70 → 2553.22] how we get to journey together, and we are called children of God.
[2553.22 → 2558.70] And I just want you to ponder on that idea for a moment.
[2558.70 → 2564.70] What does it mean to be a true child of somebody?
[2564.70 → 2567.70] You are a child of your parents.
[2567.70 → 2570.14] You are a child in your family.
[2570.14 → 2571.18] And what does that mean?
[2571.18 → 2577.70] And so thinking about what it means to be family and thinking about our identity as children of God, it occurred to me this past week.
[2577.70 → 2579.02] I had a thought.
[2579.02 → 2582.50] When I was younger, I had a friend come over to our house.
[2582.50 → 2584.74] This friend, I'll call him Dallas.
[2584.74 → 2586.90] This friend was very extroverted.
[2586.90 → 2590.42] He was actually a really silly, funny kid, made everyone laugh at school.
[2590.42 → 2594.78] But then we have him over, and he's acting all shy and awkward.
[2594.78 → 2600.08] And so when I was young, I remember thinking, Dallas, why are you acting all weird?
[2601.00 → 2602.82] You are in my house.
[2603.46 → 2605.00] You are my friend.
[2605.22 → 2606.46] I invited you over.
[2606.72 → 2608.72] You belong in this house.
[2609.24 → 2611.86] Stop acting all shy and awkward.
[2612.16 → 2614.24] That was the thought process that I had.
[2614.74 → 2620.26] And it occurred to me, this sort of example, is sort of what Paul is saying to the Galatian church.
[2620.42 → 2627.42] He's saying to us, you are God's children, free and loved by the Father.
[2628.34 → 2636.76] So why, if you belong in God's family as His children, why do you want to go back to feeling all awkward in God's house?
[2637.66 → 2640.62] And in His words, why do you want to go back to being a slave?
[2642.20 → 2646.02] And so he's saying, through Jesus Christ, the gospel for us,
[2646.02 → 2653.36] through Jesus Christ, we are called His children, fully privileged, fully free.
[2654.40 → 2659.72] That's the gospel, not that plus something else in order to become God's children.
[2660.12 → 2664.14] It is only by Christ and by His grace alone.
[2664.26 → 2667.14] And so with that in mind, if you have your Bibles with you,
[2667.14 → 2669.50] if you can turn with me to Galatians 4.
[2670.22 → 2672.84] Galatians 4, and we'll start reading from the first verse.
[2675.64 → 2677.72] Forgive me if I feel a little bit rushed.
[2678.28 → 2679.52] I'll try to slow down.
[2681.34 → 2683.58] Verse 1 from chapter 4.
[2683.58 → 2688.94] What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage,
[2689.08 → 2693.14] he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.
[2693.96 → 2699.70] The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.
[2700.82 → 2707.84] So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces of the world.
[2707.84 → 2713.44] But when the set time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman,
[2713.86 → 2717.62] born under the law, to redeem those under the law,
[2718.20 → 2720.70] that we might receive adoption to son ship.
[2721.44 → 2726.88] Because you are His sons, God sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts,
[2727.30 → 2729.78] the Spirit who calls out,
[2730.16 → 2731.24] APA, Father.
[2732.30 → 2735.52] So you are no longer a slave, but God's child.
[2735.52 → 2740.48] And since you are His child, God has made you also an heir.
[2741.52 → 2741.88] Amen.
[2743.64 → 2750.40] And since we were reminded of the whole backstory of God's mission through Abraham to all nations last week,
[2750.90 → 2757.22] today I want to focus on what that plan means for our lives as children of God.
[2758.18 → 2761.46] Because what Paul says at the beginning of the passage that we read,
[2761.46 → 2767.92] he's simply illustrating what the Judaizes were trying to argue, their false gospel.
[2768.68 → 2770.92] So in response to these false teachings,
[2771.46 → 2775.66] Paul illustrates how being an underage heir, the way he puts it,
[2776.04 → 2777.16] is like being a slave.
[2777.82 → 2783.32] You don't have authority to exercise the rights and privileges of a true heir in a family.
[2783.32 → 2789.10] And so with that image in mind, an underage heir is under the care of guardians and trustees.
[2789.64 → 2794.64] The guardians and trustees is what Paul is illustrating as what the law was doing.
[2795.60 → 2799.20] So for the Jews, the law was gifted to them.
[2799.48 → 2801.66] The law is the good word of God.
[2802.06 → 2806.70] But it was supposed to act as a guide until the set time.
[2807.64 → 2808.88] Until the set time.
[2808.88 → 2812.12] And so Paul explained this again in Galatians 3.
[2813.00 → 2814.88] Why then was the law given at all?
[2815.80 → 2819.40] It was added because of transgressions until the seed,
[2819.70 → 2823.64] until the seed to whom the promise referred to had come.
[2824.46 → 2827.50] And so all these keywords again should spark our memory.
[2828.06 → 2830.86] The promise until the seed, capital S.
[2831.28 → 2832.76] The set time in its fullness.
[2833.12 → 2835.72] These are all reminders of the biblical story.
[2835.72 → 2838.48] And if you're familiar here at Hope,
[2838.52 → 2841.36] and if you've taken Surge, or you're in Surge right now,
[2841.54 → 2843.44] you're familiar with the biblical arrows,
[2843.44 → 2844.36] biblical arrows,
[2844.90 → 2846.76] the arrows of the biblical story.
[2847.70 → 2849.34] And so in that,
[2849.50 → 2852.74] if you can imagine the story of God's good creation coming down,
[2853.16 → 2855.40] the fall and the rebellion represented by the X,
[2855.68 → 2861.94] the horizontal arrow that signifies God's choosing of Abraham to be a blessing for the world.
[2861.94 → 2864.82] And the law was given to them as a gift.
[2865.58 → 2867.32] It was only supposed to act as a guide.
[2867.66 → 2869.78] Until now we get to the cross.
[2870.22 → 2875.08] Until the set time when God's own son was sent to us,
[2875.36 → 2876.80] which is the gospel message.
[2878.68 → 2880.58] And until this set time,
[2880.74 → 2884.74] what Paul is illustrating to the Jews and Gentiles alike,
[2885.12 → 2887.44] because the false teachings were trying to come in,
[2887.66 → 2888.82] into the Galatian church,
[2888.82 → 2892.08] what Paul is saying is until this set time,
[2892.54 → 2894.70] whether you're a Jew or a Gentile,
[2895.70 → 2897.96] we were all in slavery to sin.
[2899.08 → 2900.80] All in slavery to sin.
[2901.18 → 2902.68] For the Jews specifically,
[2903.10 → 2905.56] Paul is saying you were in slavery to the law.
[2906.46 → 2907.64] Now why would he say that?
[2908.14 → 2911.58] Why would he say that we were in slavery to the law,
[2911.84 → 2912.88] under the law?
[2913.60 → 2915.38] Because for the Jews specifically,
[2915.58 → 2917.00] the law was gifted to them,
[2917.20 → 2917.88] as I've mentioned.
[2917.88 → 2919.40] But it was only a guide.
[2920.16 → 2922.26] And that's why the law and the Old Testament
[2922.26 → 2924.74] is foreshadowing a true Saviour,
[2925.04 → 2926.10] a true Messiah,
[2926.42 → 2928.92] that would come in the set time,
[2929.38 → 2931.10] in the fullness of God's plan.
[2932.08 → 2934.16] In Romans 8, Paul says this,
[2934.72 → 2936.88] Therefore, there is now no condemnation
[2937.56 → 2940.06] for those who are in Christ Jesus,
[2940.30 → 2942.16] because through Christ Jesus,
[2942.16 → 2944.16] the law of the Spirit,
[2944.16 → 2944.18] the law of the Spirit,
[2944.18 → 2945.36] who gives life,
[2945.72 → 2948.56] has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[2949.52 → 2950.32] And so hear this,
[2950.74 → 2953.28] what the law was powerless to do,
[2954.28 → 2955.92] it was powerless to do,
[2956.02 → 2957.54] because it was weakened by the flesh,
[2958.08 → 2960.70] God did by sending His own Son
[2960.70 → 2962.86] in the likeness of sinful flesh
[2962.86 → 2963.92] to be a sin offering.
[2963.92 → 2966.00] Just like we looked at last week
[2966.00 → 2966.76] in Galatians 3,
[2967.30 → 2969.16] Jesus became the curse
[2969.16 → 2971.22] so that He can free us
[2971.22 → 2973.04] from being under the curse of the law.
[2974.52 → 2975.84] And then for the Gentiles,
[2976.64 → 2977.04] us,
[2977.72 → 2979.94] they were in slavery to false gods,
[2980.38 → 2981.22] false idols.
[2982.52 → 2985.72] Same image of being slaves to sin.
[2986.40 → 2987.72] And Paul says again in Romans,
[2987.72 → 2990.10] although they claimed to be wise,
[2990.88 → 2991.90] they became fools
[2991.90 → 2993.92] and exchanged the glory
[2993.92 → 2995.18] of the immortal God,
[2995.28 → 2995.86] God Himself,
[2996.64 → 2998.56] for images made to look like
[2998.56 → 3000.02] mortal human beings
[3000.02 → 3002.62] and birds and animals and reptiles.
[3003.70 → 3006.00] That's our slavery to the sin.
[3007.02 → 3008.48] And so a whole creation,
[3008.84 → 3010.44] all creation was in longing
[3010.44 → 3011.68] for redemption,
[3012.38 → 3013.76] in longing for a Saviour,
[3014.06 → 3015.06] whether it knew it or not.
[3015.06 → 3017.54] And Paul describes this
[3017.54 → 3019.82] as creation groaning in birth pains
[3019.82 → 3021.38] until the coming of Christ.
[3022.56 → 3023.22] And so again,
[3023.48 → 3024.34] this is the backstory
[3024.34 → 3025.70] of Paul's passionate letter
[3025.70 → 3026.54] to the Galatians.
[3027.12 → 3028.98] The set time in God's fullness,
[3029.60 → 3031.26] in the fullness of His plan,
[3031.64 → 3032.98] is now here.
[3033.78 → 3036.46] That is the good news for you, Galatians.
[3036.68 → 3038.84] That is the good news for us, church.
[3039.62 → 3040.96] The set time is here.
[3041.06 → 3042.26] We're not waiting for it.
[3042.26 → 3045.20] It is already fulfilled through Christ.
[3046.24 → 3047.68] So don't go back.
[3048.82 → 3050.08] You are God's children.
[3050.60 → 3052.14] Why are you trying to go back
[3052.14 → 3053.20] to being like a slave?
[3055.48 → 3057.36] And as God's children,
[3058.12 → 3059.12] you're not left alone.
[3059.88 → 3060.94] Christ did not come,
[3061.48 → 3062.30] defeat sin,
[3062.50 → 3063.60] and become a curse for us,
[3063.72 → 3064.92] defeat all the effects
[3064.92 → 3065.94] of the curse and the sin,
[3066.56 → 3067.40] ascended and said,
[3067.52 → 3067.92] good luck,
[3068.24 → 3069.10] try to live like me.
[3069.10 → 3071.62] No, what He did was
[3071.62 → 3073.30] He sent His own spirit
[3073.30 → 3075.00] to empower us,
[3075.28 → 3076.40] to encourage us,
[3076.74 → 3077.86] and enable us
[3077.86 → 3080.06] to even call God Himself
[3080.06 → 3082.00] our own Father
[3082.00 → 3083.96] because we are His children.
[3085.22 → 3086.98] And the phrase that Paul uses here
[3086.98 → 3087.52] in Galatians,
[3087.74 → 3087.96] 아빠,
[3088.70 → 3089.98] which I say it
[3089.98 → 3090.90] with a different pronunciation.
[3091.08 → 3092.14] I don't know if you can catch it
[3092.14 → 3093.08] because that's the way
[3093.08 → 3094.28] we say dad in Korean.
[3094.92 → 3095.18] 아빠.
[3095.68 → 3096.52] Like it would be weird
[3096.52 → 3097.54] for me to call my dad
[3097.54 → 3098.16] like 아버지,
[3098.22 → 3099.28] which is a little more formal.
[3100.06 → 3100.20] Right?
[3100.52 → 3101.22] So it's 아빠.
[3101.34 → 3102.58] It's a very intimate way
[3102.58 → 3103.60] of saying dad.
[3104.50 → 3105.68] God is my dad.
[3106.88 → 3108.52] When you have to take it
[3108.52 → 3109.16] in context
[3109.16 → 3110.48] because for the Jews
[3110.48 → 3111.28] hearing this,
[3111.86 → 3112.40] the Jews,
[3112.60 → 3113.82] according to the law,
[3114.10 → 3115.08] weren't even allowed
[3115.08 → 3117.10] to utter God's own name
[3117.10 → 3118.74] because it was so holy
[3118.74 → 3119.24] and sacred.
[3120.18 → 3121.82] But God is saying
[3121.82 → 3123.16] through His Spirit,
[3123.48 → 3124.02] through the work
[3124.02 → 3124.94] of Jesus Christ,
[3125.02 → 3126.22] and now through His Spirit,
[3126.22 → 3127.74] you have received
[3127.74 → 3128.76] the Spirit of adoption.
[3129.60 → 3130.68] You don't have to
[3130.68 → 3132.92] limit yourself
[3132.92 → 3133.72] from God
[3133.72 → 3135.74] because God has accepted you
[3135.74 → 3136.56] into His family.
[3136.78 → 3138.18] And you can call Him dad.
[3138.64 → 3139.38] You can call Him
[3139.38 → 3140.38] 아빠, father.
[3142.78 → 3144.26] And so by His Spirit,
[3144.36 → 3145.28] we get to cry out,
[3145.90 → 3146.84] You are my God.
[3147.32 → 3148.80] You are my loving 아빠.
[3149.46 → 3150.94] And in you and you alone,
[3151.16 → 3152.46] we live and move
[3152.46 → 3153.40] and have our being
[3153.40 → 3155.14] because we are His children.
[3155.14 → 3158.24] No longer a slave,
[3158.52 → 3159.42] but God's child.
[3159.76 → 3161.28] And since you are His child,
[3161.62 → 3162.46] God has made you
[3162.46 → 3163.24] also an heir.
[3164.60 → 3165.80] This was something
[3165.80 → 3166.54] that the law
[3166.54 → 3167.52] could never do.
[3168.84 → 3169.60] And so the warning,
[3169.90 → 3170.08] again,
[3170.14 → 3171.08] for the Galatians is,
[3171.46 → 3172.78] if you receive this gospel
[3172.78 → 3173.54] of adoption,
[3174.10 → 3175.30] you're fully privileged
[3175.30 → 3176.80] and free children of God.
[3177.78 → 3178.56] Don't go back
[3178.56 → 3179.30] to being a slave.
[3180.16 → 3181.48] That's the false teaching.
[3181.48 → 3183.14] The Judaizes were trying
[3183.14 → 3185.46] to somehow perfect Christianity
[3185.46 → 3187.60] by adding the law of Moses.
[3188.16 → 3189.88] And they had behind that
[3189.88 → 3190.48] nationalistic,
[3191.38 → 3192.56] highly pragmatic,
[3193.06 → 3195.30] and social intentions behind it.
[3196.36 → 3197.44] Lots of words there.
[3197.78 → 3198.50] Simply put,
[3198.60 → 3199.28] what the Jews,
[3199.40 → 3201.18] the Judaizes were trying to do was,
[3201.48 → 3202.74] they were trying to define
[3202.74 → 3204.78] who the real family of God were,
[3205.02 → 3206.74] who the real children of God were,
[3206.86 → 3208.72] but by their own
[3208.72 → 3209.98] traditional standards.
[3212.58 → 3213.82] But this
[3213.82 → 3215.54] is not right
[3215.54 → 3216.04] because,
[3216.40 → 3217.00] in fact,
[3217.34 → 3218.10] the Galatians,
[3218.24 → 3219.64] the Gentiles that were called
[3219.64 → 3220.36] into faith
[3220.36 → 3222.36] to become children of God
[3222.36 → 3223.28] was through
[3223.28 → 3224.24] God's own
[3224.24 → 3225.38] spirit,
[3226.14 → 3227.58] through His grace,
[3227.74 → 3228.46] by faith,
[3229.42 → 3231.34] not being ethnically Jewish.
[3233.72 → 3234.68] That's why
[3234.68 → 3235.78] the gospel message,
[3235.94 → 3236.32] we say,
[3236.80 → 3237.68] is Christ.
[3237.68 → 3240.24] Christ is enough.
[3241.64 → 3243.20] Jesus is the answer.
[3243.92 → 3245.14] He has invited
[3245.14 → 3246.10] into His family.
[3246.48 → 3247.96] The Master has called us
[3247.96 → 3248.62] into His family.
[3248.98 → 3250.18] Who is going to say,
[3250.60 → 3250.84] no,
[3251.24 → 3252.16] you still have to get
[3252.16 → 3252.94] circumcised,
[3253.04 → 3253.72] circumcised.
[3253.96 → 3254.18] No,
[3254.32 → 3255.36] you still have to keep
[3255.36 → 3256.26] dietary laws.
[3256.92 → 3257.90] You have to fit
[3257.90 → 3259.40] into a specific mould,
[3259.62 → 3260.84] otherwise you don't belong.
[3263.32 → 3264.24] Paul says,
[3264.48 → 3264.80] no,
[3265.36 → 3266.62] you do belong.
[3266.62 → 3268.50] you do belong
[3268.50 → 3269.36] in God's family.
[3271.58 → 3271.86] And so,
[3272.02 → 3273.20] I don't know if you can
[3273.20 → 3273.84] catch it here.
[3274.76 → 3275.68] And Pastor Dave
[3275.68 → 3276.18] mentioned this
[3276.18 → 3276.62] at the beginning
[3276.62 → 3277.28] of our series
[3277.28 → 3278.06] of Galatians.
[3278.78 → 3279.94] What do we,
[3280.48 → 3281.18] whether subtly
[3281.18 → 3282.80] or explicitly,
[3283.46 → 3284.92] add to our gospel
[3284.92 → 3286.52] to define
[3286.52 → 3288.32] who is a real Christians are?
[3288.32 → 3288.44] God.
[3290.20 → 3290.68] So,
[3290.74 → 3291.36] think about it.
[3291.68 → 3292.24] When we have
[3292.24 → 3292.72] new members
[3292.72 → 3293.66] coming into our church
[3293.66 → 3294.58] or new people
[3294.58 → 3295.20] that just come
[3295.20 → 3296.16] and join us
[3296.16 → 3296.68] for worship,
[3297.64 → 3299.04] what do we ask
[3299.04 → 3299.82] or require
[3299.82 → 3300.64] them
[3300.64 → 3303.16] to join our church,
[3303.40 → 3304.26] to belong here?
[3305.26 → 3306.38] Do we ask them
[3306.38 → 3307.18] or require them
[3307.18 → 3307.98] to be more Dutch
[3307.98 → 3308.82] or Korean?
[3309.66 → 3310.76] Do we ask them
[3310.76 → 3311.68] to sing more
[3311.68 → 3312.36] Hill song
[3312.36 → 3313.48] instead of hymns
[3313.48 → 3313.94] because we're
[3313.94 → 3314.66] more contemporary?
[3314.66 → 3316.72] Do we ask them
[3316.72 → 3318.90] to dress less formally?
[3319.36 → 3320.06] Dress casually.
[3320.34 → 3321.20] We're not that traditional.
[3321.62 → 3321.72] Oh,
[3321.74 → 3322.44] you don't belong here
[3322.44 → 3323.14] if you wear a suit.
[3323.82 → 3324.44] It's weird how
[3324.44 → 3325.42] things flip around,
[3325.54 → 3325.66] huh?
[3326.50 → 3327.22] Because the church,
[3327.38 → 3328.22] the traditional church
[3328.22 → 3328.86] I grew up in,
[3329.08 → 3329.78] if you're a pastor
[3329.78 → 3330.62] and you don't wear a tie,
[3331.10 → 3332.00] you get rejected
[3332.00 → 3332.48] at the door.
[3332.56 → 3333.38] You don't belong here.
[3336.42 → 3337.18] That's why
[3337.18 → 3338.50] the vision statement
[3338.50 → 3339.36] here at Hope
[3339.36 → 3341.66] is belonged,
[3342.42 → 3342.72] believe,
[3342.84 → 3343.10] become.
[3343.10 → 3344.90] The order is very
[3344.90 → 3346.62] important for us.
[3347.60 → 3348.28] Belong,
[3348.72 → 3349.14] believe,
[3349.32 → 3349.62] become.
[3350.88 → 3351.62] You belong
[3351.62 → 3353.46] wherever you come from,
[3353.84 → 3354.70] whatever journey
[3354.70 → 3356.12] God has taken you through.
[3356.84 → 3358.10] You belong here
[3358.10 → 3359.60] by His grace
[3359.60 → 3360.98] through faith.
[3361.56 → 3362.24] You belong.
[3363.74 → 3364.80] There is neither Jew
[3364.80 → 3365.74] nor Gentile,
[3366.06 → 3366.86] neither slave
[3366.86 → 3367.48] nor free,
[3367.94 → 3368.92] nor is there
[3368.92 → 3370.14] male and female,
[3370.14 → 3372.12] for you are all one
[3372.12 → 3372.98] in Christ Jesus.
[3373.10 → 3374.28] in the same language,
[3374.66 → 3376.06] heirs according
[3376.06 → 3376.94] to the promise.
[3378.22 → 3379.38] You are all
[3379.38 → 3380.56] fully privileged,
[3381.14 → 3382.02] free children
[3382.02 → 3382.66] of God.
[3383.94 → 3384.92] This has been
[3384.92 → 3385.64] God's plan
[3385.64 → 3386.72] to restore
[3386.72 → 3387.54] the brokenness
[3387.54 → 3388.14] that came from
[3388.14 → 3388.64] a rebellion
[3388.64 → 3389.52] in the first place.
[3390.34 → 3391.52] As we got to
[3391.52 → 3392.80] welcome our new members,
[3393.06 → 3394.24] as we got to witness
[3394.24 → 3395.14] and promise
[3395.14 → 3395.88] to journey with
[3395.88 → 3396.30] Jane
[3396.30 → 3397.34] and Scarlett
[3397.34 → 3398.00] and their family
[3398.00 → 3399.06] and our new members,
[3399.06 → 3401.68] we get to reflect
[3401.68 → 3402.92] God's family.
[3404.62 → 3406.22] This is our identity hope.
[3406.92 → 3407.72] We are loved
[3407.72 → 3408.34] and free
[3408.34 → 3408.98] in Christ
[3408.98 → 3409.86] as His children
[3409.86 → 3411.06] and knowing
[3411.06 → 3412.20] that you are
[3412.20 → 3412.72] deeply
[3412.72 → 3414.42] and unconditionally
[3414.42 → 3415.18] loved,
[3416.68 → 3416.96] bearing,
[3417.50 → 3418.36] we are able
[3418.36 → 3419.08] to then
[3419.08 → 3420.16] bear one another
[3420.16 → 3421.40] with love
[3421.40 → 3422.74] and all the fruits
[3422.74 → 3423.38] of the Spirit,
[3423.68 → 3424.78] fruit of the Spirit,
[3424.84 → 3425.88] that we get to look at
[3425.88 → 3426.92] next week.
[3428.46 → 3429.50] And as we become
[3429.50 → 3430.36] more attentive
[3430.36 → 3432.36] and freely receive
[3432.36 → 3433.34] the love of the Father,
[3433.62 → 3434.46] we can allow
[3434.46 → 3435.40] His love
[3435.40 → 3436.58] to overflow
[3436.58 → 3438.52] through our lives
[3438.52 → 3439.72] onto our neighbours,
[3440.04 → 3440.56] our friends,
[3440.68 → 3441.36] our co-workers,
[3441.76 → 3443.90] our own family members.
[3446.18 → 3447.42] This identity
[3447.42 → 3449.00] being God's children,
[3450.02 → 3451.36] this is enabled
[3451.36 → 3452.42] and empowered
[3452.42 → 3453.88] by God's own Spirit.
[3454.20 → 3455.74] We do not do this alone.
[3455.88 → 3457.30] There is no way
[3457.30 → 3459.08] we can even reflect
[3459.08 → 3460.04] God's goodness
[3460.04 → 3460.78] if it were left
[3460.78 → 3461.72] to our own devices.
[3462.56 → 3463.86] God's own Spirit
[3463.86 → 3465.08] has called us
[3465.08 → 3466.52] into adoption,
[3466.84 → 3468.08] into God's family.
[3469.04 → 3470.12] You are loved.
[3470.78 → 3472.02] You are a loved child
[3472.02 → 3472.54] of God.
[3473.10 → 3473.78] All of us.
[3474.36 → 3475.40] Receive that love.
[3475.70 → 3476.72] Let it overflow
[3476.72 → 3478.14] through our lives.
[3479.26 → 3480.06] And we sing
[3480.06 → 3480.96] Christ alone.
[3482.48 → 3483.46] You belong
[3483.46 → 3484.28] because Christ
[3484.28 → 3484.98] has called you.
[3484.98 → 3486.50] You belong
[3486.50 → 3486.98] because...
[3490.98 → 3494.16] I shouldn't have
[3494.16 → 3494.86] looked that way.
[3495.46 → 3496.34] I was getting emotional
[3496.34 → 3497.06] through the baptism
[3497.06 → 3498.08] and I look over there
[3498.08 → 3498.48] and it's like,
[3498.64 → 3498.82] yeah,
[3499.20 → 3500.02] you belong
[3500.02 → 3500.84] because Christ
[3500.84 → 3501.52] has called you.
[3504.82 → 3506.18] We are His family.
[3507.14 → 3507.86] And like Paul,
[3507.94 → 3508.98] we get to confess together.
[3508.98 → 3510.30] It is no longer
[3510.30 → 3511.36] I who live
[3511.36 → 3512.44] but Christ
[3512.44 → 3513.46] living in me.
[3514.22 → 3515.58] We are His children.
[3515.74 → 3516.22] Let's pray.
[3522.62 → 3523.54] Loving Father,
[3523.88 → 3524.92] we thank you so much
[3524.92 → 3526.30] for bringing us together
[3526.30 → 3527.28] as your family.
[3528.82 → 3529.88] We've said this word
[3529.88 → 3531.20] so many times today, Lord.
[3531.28 → 3532.34] We are your children
[3532.34 → 3533.62] and we are your family.
[3534.82 → 3536.72] Help us to really reflect that
[3536.72 → 3537.34] because, Lord,
[3537.54 → 3539.26] we go through seasons of doubt.
[3540.08 → 3542.46] We go through seasons of suffering
[3542.46 → 3543.88] and sometimes it's hard
[3543.88 → 3545.74] to even acknowledge
[3545.74 → 3547.28] and remember our identity
[3547.28 → 3549.28] as loved children of yours.
[3550.24 → 3551.12] So I pray
[3551.12 → 3552.08] that you will continue
[3552.08 → 3552.78] to guide us
[3552.78 → 3553.70] through your Holy Spirit.
[3554.24 → 3555.82] Remind us of our identity,
[3556.18 → 3556.72] that we are loved
[3557.28 → 3559.10] and we are fully privileged,
[3559.32 → 3560.74] free children of yours.
[3560.74 → 3563.02] And we get to receive that love.
[3564.18 → 3565.92] We get to receive that
[3565.92 → 3567.90] and help that love
[3567.90 → 3569.48] overflow through our lives
[3569.48 → 3570.38] as we continue
[3570.38 → 3572.02] to seek your guidance,
[3572.34 → 3573.18] as we continue
[3573.18 → 3574.38] to depend on you
[3574.38 → 3576.22] all throughout our lives.
[3576.70 → 3577.64] We thank you again
[3577.64 → 3578.98] for this morning
[3578.98 → 3580.18] and this early afternoon
[3580.18 → 3581.28] that we get to celebrate
[3581.28 → 3582.78] being your family together.
[3583.16 → 3584.88] All glory to you, God.
[3585.22 → 3586.16] In Jesus' name.
[3586.94 → 3587.22] Amen.
[3587.96 → 3588.24] Amen.
[3588.24 → 3589.92] I invite you to stand
[3589.92 → 3591.24] as we sing our song of...
