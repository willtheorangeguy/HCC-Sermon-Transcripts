[1949.86 → 1979.84] And I'm going to invite you.
[1979.84 → 2009.82] Good morning.
[2009.82 → 2039.82] Thank you.
[2039.82 → 2069.82] Thank you.
[2069.82 → 2099.82] Thank you.

[2309.76 → 2339.74] Thank you.
[2339.74 → 2369.72] Thank you.
[2369.72 → 2399.70] Thank you.
[2399.70 → 2429.68] Thank you.
[2429.68 → 2459.68] Thank you.
[2459.68 → 2489.66] Thank you.
[2489.66 → 2519.66] Thank you.
[2519.66 → 2549.64] Thank you.
[2549.64 → 2579.64] Thank you.
[2579.64 → 2609.62] Thank you.
[2609.62 → 2639.62] Thank you.
[2639.62 → 2669.60] Thank you.
[2669.62 → 2699.60] Good morning.
[2699.62 → 2729.60] And I have to say,
[2729.62 → 2732.60] the last, let's say, 18 years or so.
[2733.16 → 2735.98] But as I think about the journey of those years,
[2736.32 → 2739.58] it really is and has been this adventure,
[2740.24 → 2743.84] has been this wonderful, precious, yeah, walk with the Lord.
[2744.62 → 2747.40] From all the really kind of mundane and subtle,
[2747.50 → 2750.46] but also powerful ways the Holy Spirit has been working in my life.
[2750.58 → 2754.72] I think about the constant and many whispered affirmations
[2754.72 → 2756.42] of the Father's love for me.
[2757.06 → 2760.28] Ways that the Holy Spirit has directly taught me truth from Scripture,
[2760.82 → 2763.78] which then I also kind of heard other authors teaching.
[2764.46 → 2767.72] Ways that He's encouraged my heart when I've been through hard times
[2767.72 → 2769.70] or difficulty or even suffering.
[2770.40 → 2772.74] Ways He's spoken about my calling and gifts
[2772.74 → 2777.22] and also helped me to help others to see their callings and gifts.
[2778.10 → 2783.10] Really, the Holy Spirit actually does what Jesus said that He would do, right?
[2783.10 → 2788.42] He is faithful to being who He is and to offering the ministry to us, the church.
[2788.76 → 2790.64] He's so gentle and kind.
[2791.08 → 2792.90] He's dynamic and fierce.
[2793.26 → 2794.04] He is good.
[2794.22 → 2795.08] He is wise.
[2796.20 → 2798.70] But the reality is I'm not here to preach my story.
[2798.88 → 2800.44] I'm here to preach the text.
[2801.00 → 2802.98] So I want to share from Ephesians 3,
[2803.50 → 2806.02] one of my favourite blessings in Scripture,
[2806.16 → 2808.18] not just pray it but to help preach it
[2808.18 → 2811.76] and hope that the Spirit really opens it up for us this morning.
[2812.70 → 2814.22] So turn with me to Ephesians 3,
[2814.28 → 2816.46] and I read 16 to 21.
[2817.68 → 2820.06] I pray that out of His glorious riches,
[2820.64 → 2823.58] He the Father may strengthen you and I
[2823.58 → 2826.24] with power through His Spirit in your inner being,
[2826.64 → 2829.68] so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[2830.34 → 2833.50] And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,
[2833.50 → 2836.40] may have power together with all the saints
[2836.40 → 2840.30] to grasp how wide and long and high and deep
[2840.30 → 2841.66] is the love of Christ,
[2842.22 → 2845.78] and to know this love that surpasses knowledge,
[2846.02 → 2849.82] so that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
[2850.82 → 2853.12] Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more
[2853.12 → 2855.08] than all we ask or imagine,
[2855.52 → 2858.24] according to His power that is at work within us,
[2858.70 → 2862.14] to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus,
[2862.14 → 2864.90] throughout all generations, forever and ever.
[2865.56 → 2865.88] Amen.
[2868.30 → 2872.76] Have you ever come in contact with someone who is rather intense?
[2873.74 → 2875.90] Maybe you could feel their energy
[2875.90 → 2878.56] or the forcefulness of their personality.
[2878.98 → 2882.24] Maybe it was the way they talked within authority or volume.
[2882.76 → 2886.30] Maybe they got just a bit too close within your comfort zone.
[2886.68 → 2889.66] How did you respond at that moment to that person?
[2889.66 → 2893.58] I know that as an introvert, maybe a bit of a quieter type,
[2893.90 → 2896.24] I would likely feel or have felt intimidated.
[2896.86 → 2898.40] I might emotionally recoil.
[2898.90 → 2900.94] I might physically step back a bit.
[2901.52 → 2903.20] Maybe suggest a breath mint for them.
[2904.08 → 2905.78] I don't know how you respond.
[2906.18 → 2908.84] But in this text, we are brought face to face
[2908.84 → 2911.08] with the intensity of God
[2911.08 → 2915.22] and the radicalness of the life that He intends
[2915.22 → 2918.24] for each one of us through His Holy Spirit.
[2918.24 → 2921.66] And this text is not just for a few,
[2921.84 → 2925.08] for the devoted few, for the spiritual elite.
[2925.28 → 2927.56] This is what God has for each one of us.
[2927.62 → 2928.40] This is accessible.
[2928.82 → 2931.88] This is possible for you and me through the Holy Spirit.
[2932.60 → 2934.34] So let's dive into this text.
[2935.18 → 2937.58] While the passage here in the English
[2937.58 → 2939.66] has multiple sentences,
[2940.28 → 2945.06] it's actually one long loaded sentence in the Greek.
[2945.06 → 2948.30] It's kind of classic Paul with his phrase stacking.
[2949.06 → 2951.82] All the English majors would be horrified at his grammar
[2951.82 → 2953.14] with all the run-on sentences.
[2954.10 → 2955.84] But the reality is that he's so moved
[2955.84 → 2957.56] and in passion and consumed
[2957.56 → 2959.72] that his heart just kind of bursts
[2959.72 → 2963.38] and just kind of can't just like let grammar hold him back
[2963.38 → 2964.48] or just keep him down.
[2964.78 → 2964.86] Right?
[2964.90 → 2965.58] He just wants to be free.
[2965.80 → 2967.26] Kind of colour outside the lines.
[2967.26 → 2970.36] And this text is really structured around
[2970.36 → 2972.84] four keywords or ideas.
[2973.16 → 2973.28] Okay?
[2973.74 → 2977.62] Power, trust, love, fullness.
[2978.14 → 2978.40] Okay?
[2978.78 → 2982.00] And they build off each other with three southeast.
[2982.34 → 2984.10] Power, so-that, trust.
[2984.60 → 2986.12] Power, so-that, love.
[2986.44 → 2987.62] Love, so-that, fullness.
[2987.62 → 2991.80] And together they really create this composite picture
[2991.80 → 2994.46] of normal life within the kingdom of God.
[2995.40 → 2996.90] So really it's not always wise to do this
[2996.90 → 2999.60] but to really summarize the sermon in one sentence.
[2999.74 → 3000.54] It is a mouthful.
[3001.30 → 3003.70] But really Paul is praying for the Holy Spirit
[3003.70 → 3005.96] to supernaturally strengthen them
[3005.96 → 3009.68] so that they can let Christ live in them through trust
[3009.68 → 3012.68] and they can experience tangibly the love of God
[3012.68 → 3016.74] and let their life overflow with the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[3017.54 → 3017.72] Okay?
[3018.20 → 3018.74] Got that?
[3019.02 → 3019.28] Great.
[3020.12 → 3022.24] Let's begin with the first word or idea.
[3022.88 → 3023.24] Power.
[3024.36 → 3027.06] Now I've noticed that we in the Western Church
[3027.06 → 3030.00] don't talk much about spiritual power
[3030.00 → 3032.16] and its place in the Christian life.
[3033.10 → 3036.04] What I've noticed is that my friends in Uganda and Nicaragua
[3036.04 → 3038.26] talk a lot about power and our need for it.
[3038.96 → 3041.28] I wonder if it's because we in the Western Church
[3041.28 → 3043.20] are pretty self-sufficient.
[3043.36 → 3045.94] We see ourselves as quite capable people.
[3046.90 → 3050.58] Perhaps it's because we've seen Christian leaders and writers
[3050.58 → 3053.62] abuse power and position
[3053.62 → 3056.86] and just leave kind of damaged people's lives
[3056.86 → 3059.34] and faiths and trust behind them.
[3059.70 → 3061.60] And so perhaps the topic, even the word of power
[3061.60 → 3064.58] might make us feel a bit skirmish or nervous.
[3065.40 → 3068.38] But the reality is the Bible has a lot to say
[3068.38 → 3071.40] about God's power in the life of believers.
[3072.04 → 3074.32] So I want to encourage us maybe to name
[3074.32 → 3075.62] that we might have those reservations,
[3076.30 → 3079.46] but to not let unholy abuse of power
[3079.46 → 3082.06] close off from catching a biblical vision
[3082.06 → 3086.22] for holy power in service and in godliness.
[3087.28 → 3087.46] Okay?
[3087.88 → 3090.58] One commentator points out that the Holy Spirit
[3090.58 → 3095.04] and power are practically inseparable in Scripture.
[3095.04 → 3096.28] They go together.
[3097.10 → 3099.20] And the Holy Spirit really is, in a sense,
[3099.48 → 3103.04] God's personal power and presence in our lives.
[3103.58 → 3103.82] Okay?
[3104.04 → 3104.96] The Holy Spirit, power.
[3105.10 → 3105.94] Go together.
[3106.08 → 3106.50] Inseparable.
[3107.54 → 3110.18] The reality is, if I had to say it in one sentence,
[3110.46 → 3113.04] we need the holy power of the Holy Spirit
[3113.04 → 3114.30] to live a holy life.
[3115.60 → 3115.84] Amen?
[3116.20 → 3118.72] We need the Holy Spirit to have holy power
[3118.72 → 3119.62] and to live a holy life.
[3119.62 → 3121.28] I mean, if you have your Bibles,
[3121.60 → 3122.38] open your Bibles.
[3122.88 → 3124.10] Here's a quick pop quiz.
[3124.46 → 3126.98] How many times does the word show up in this passage?
[3127.30 → 3128.22] The word power show up.
[3130.42 → 3131.72] Non-rhetorical question.
[3132.10 → 3132.86] How many times?
[3134.98 → 3136.48] One, two, fourteen.
[3136.58 → 3136.92] How many?
[3139.58 → 3140.02] Three.
[3140.48 → 3140.66] Right?
[3141.12 → 3143.98] Verses 16, 18, and 20.
[3144.60 → 3146.88] I mean, also think about the words power
[3146.88 → 3147.70] in the New Testament.
[3147.70 → 3150.50] Think about Acts 1, verse 8.
[3151.04 → 3154.08] But you will receive power
[3154.08 → 3156.06] when the Holy Spirit comes upon you
[3156.06 → 3157.36] and you will be my witnesses.
[3158.02 → 3159.82] Think about 2 Timothy 1, 7.
[3160.26 → 3162.86] For God has not given us a spirit of timidity,
[3163.36 → 3167.18] but of power and love and self-discipline.
[3167.38 → 3168.34] You're doing good.
[3168.38 → 3168.86] You're waking up.
[3168.90 → 3169.32] This is great.
[3169.68 → 3170.80] 1 Corinthians 4, 20.
[3171.12 → 3173.86] For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk,
[3173.94 → 3175.70] but of power.
[3175.70 → 3179.04] And lastly, you can relax soon.
[3179.28 → 3181.26] 2 Timothy 2, 3.
[3181.62 → 3182.62] Sorry, 2 Timothy 3.
[3183.02 → 3185.44] Paul warns about a day when the church would see
[3185.44 → 3188.86] lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God
[3188.86 → 3190.94] having a form of godliness,
[3191.36 → 3193.92] but denying its power.
[3194.58 → 3197.60] See, power without godliness is dangerous.
[3197.76 → 3198.40] It's destructive.
[3198.40 → 3201.90] But godliness without power is weird.
[3203.12 → 3204.94] We are meant to operate in holy power
[3204.94 → 3206.18] for holy service.
[3206.58 → 3208.60] Canadian pastor and writer on the spiritual gifts,
[3209.06 → 3211.16] John Thompson calls the spiritual gifts
[3211.16 → 3214.18] guaranteed places of power
[3214.18 → 3215.82] in the believer's life.
[3216.74 → 3218.10] Our serving lives were not meant to be
[3218.10 → 3220.66] in striving and good attempts and good effort.
[3220.94 → 3223.24] They're meant to be supernaturally sourced
[3223.24 → 3225.86] and sustained by the Holy Spirit.
[3225.86 → 3228.32] I mean, just think about Jesus,
[3228.78 → 3230.52] the second member of the Trinity,
[3231.16 → 3232.66] not beginning his ministry
[3232.66 → 3236.20] until the Holy Spirit came upon him as baptism.
[3237.22 → 3240.32] God himself relied on God
[3240.32 → 3241.80] to live a godly lifestyle.
[3242.94 → 3244.10] If he did that,
[3244.16 → 3246.04] how much more do we need to do that?
[3246.66 → 3247.16] So in summary,
[3247.64 → 3249.18] in Scripture we see the Holy Spirit
[3249.18 → 3251.04] gives us holy power for holy purposes.
[3251.20 → 3251.92] We can count on it.
[3251.96 → 3252.74] We can expect it.
[3252.78 → 3253.38] It's normal.
[3253.38 → 3254.22] It's good.
[3254.88 → 3255.04] Okay.
[3256.00 → 3256.60] So why?
[3256.92 → 3258.98] Why do we have the Holy Spirit and his strength?
[3259.50 → 3261.26] Verse 17 gives our first,
[3261.48 → 3262.08] so that.
[3262.70 → 3267.22] So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.
[3268.36 → 3269.20] Open question.
[3269.44 → 3272.40] How many of us find faith in Jesus difficult?
[3273.72 → 3273.96] Right?
[3274.04 → 3275.16] You don't have to put your hands up.
[3275.44 → 3276.32] But many of us,
[3276.56 → 3278.04] whether we want to admit it or not,
[3278.44 → 3280.64] do find, I think, deep faith,
[3280.64 → 3282.28] consistent faith,
[3282.68 → 3284.20] rooted confidence in the Lord
[3284.20 → 3285.94] in a daily, ongoing way,
[3286.18 → 3286.74] a challenge.
[3287.86 → 3290.08] I know I find that I can trust Jesus well
[3290.08 → 3291.82] in waves and spurts.
[3292.42 → 3293.86] I'm mostly surrendered in my heart,
[3293.94 → 3294.60] but there are many times
[3294.60 → 3296.46] where I kind of put my hours up
[3296.46 → 3296.86] or say,
[3296.94 → 3298.00] Lord, you can come this far,
[3298.08 → 3299.18] but not that far.
[3299.30 → 3301.26] Please leave that area of my life alone.
[3301.34 → 3303.96] I can put up they do not disturb sign up.
[3303.96 → 3307.44] I can easily kind of come back to self-reliance
[3307.44 → 3311.56] and kind of leave Jesus out of many areas of my life.
[3312.48 → 3314.14] But the good news in this text is that
[3314.14 → 3316.24] the Father knows that you and I
[3316.24 → 3319.26] are not naturally nailing it with faith.
[3319.64 → 3322.58] He knows that we need the Holy Spirit to strengthen us
[3322.58 → 3324.16] to actually open our lives
[3324.16 → 3326.94] and keep our lives open to Jesus,
[3327.26 → 3328.50] his presence and his work.
[3329.62 → 3330.46] And so while Paul,
[3330.68 → 3332.32] when talking about us and Christ,
[3332.32 → 3335.64] often speaks about the believers being in Christ.
[3335.78 → 3338.22] In Christ is a favourite phrase
[3338.22 → 3340.42] and theology piece for Paul.
[3340.66 → 3341.70] But in this passage,
[3341.80 → 3343.42] this is one of five places
[3343.42 → 3346.96] where Paul talks about Christ being in us.
[3349.16 → 3350.50] And language here is not like
[3350.50 → 3352.46] pop by for a quick visit,
[3352.64 → 3353.34] how you're doing,
[3353.40 → 3354.08] you're doing good,
[3354.40 → 3354.96] see you later.
[3355.38 → 3358.24] It's the idea of this kind of master feeling
[3358.24 → 3359.56] fully at home.
[3359.66 → 3360.08] You might say,
[3360.16 → 3362.06] Christ with his feet up on the table,
[3362.06 → 3364.40] feeling very much relaxed, present.
[3365.88 → 3368.92] He's the centrepiece of our home and lives.
[3370.28 → 3371.64] Or as one author put it,
[3371.84 → 3373.32] is Jesus a guest?
[3373.88 → 3374.72] Is he a resident?
[3375.06 → 3377.24] Or is he the president of your life?
[3378.82 → 3381.92] C.S. Lewis offers us a helpful analogy
[3381.92 → 3384.32] to describe this inner experience
[3384.32 → 3385.38] and reality of Christ
[3385.38 → 3386.96] in our lives dwelling,
[3386.96 → 3389.34] and kind of maybe the surprising things
[3389.34 → 3391.52] that happen as he does that.
[3392.42 → 3393.10] C.S. Lewis says,
[3393.44 → 3395.38] imagine yourself as a living house.
[3395.68 → 3396.22] Even go ahead,
[3396.28 → 3396.88] do that now.
[3397.70 → 3400.10] God comes in to rebuild that house.
[3400.58 → 3401.18] At first,
[3401.44 → 3403.18] you understand what he is doing.
[3403.84 → 3405.36] He's getting the drains right
[3405.36 → 3407.52] and stopping the leaks in the roof
[3407.52 → 3408.08] and so on.
[3408.18 → 3410.64] You kind of knew those jobs needed doing
[3410.64 → 3411.34] and you're not surprised.
[3411.34 → 3413.08] It made sense early on.
[3413.76 → 3414.62] But presently,
[3414.72 → 3416.74] he starts knocking the house about
[3416.74 → 3419.46] in a way that hurts abominably
[3419.46 → 3421.48] and does not make any sense.
[3422.32 → 3423.66] What on earth is he up to?
[3424.06 → 3425.36] The explanation is that
[3425.36 → 3427.34] he is building quite a different house
[3427.34 → 3429.04] than the one you thought of.
[3429.54 → 3431.16] Throwing out a new wing here,
[3431.56 → 3433.14] putting on an extra floor there,
[3433.50 → 3434.40] running up towers,
[3434.56 → 3435.50] making courtyards.
[3435.50 → 3437.14] You thought you were being made
[3437.14 → 3439.18] into a decent little cottage.
[3439.88 → 3441.80] But he is building a palace
[3441.80 → 3443.40] and he intends to come
[3443.40 → 3444.78] and live in it himself.
[3446.74 → 3448.62] So my question for us this morning is,
[3449.06 → 3450.46] where might Jesus be doing
[3450.46 → 3451.60] unexpected,
[3452.12 → 3453.66] maybe painful or uncomfortable,
[3454.28 → 3456.44] renovation work in your heart and life?
[3457.08 → 3459.14] Where is there a bit of dust and mess
[3459.14 → 3460.76] as he's doing that?
[3460.86 → 3463.56] What closed doors might he be knocking on?
[3463.56 → 3466.60] What windows might he be wanting to open
[3466.60 → 3469.04] as he kind of expands your life,
[3469.18 → 3469.80] your heart,
[3470.40 → 3471.16] maybe your ministry
[3471.16 → 3472.32] to make room for others?
[3473.76 → 3474.58] It can be painful,
[3474.80 → 3475.40] but my encouragement,
[3475.48 → 3476.42] and this text's encouragement,
[3476.60 → 3477.94] is that Jesus can be trusted.
[3478.34 → 3479.80] He knows what he is doing.
[3481.72 → 3483.72] Secondly, Paul prays for power
[3483.72 → 3485.06] that we might take hold
[3485.06 → 3488.14] of the immensity of Christ's love
[3488.14 → 3489.74] and taste its intensity
[3489.74 → 3491.42] via personal experience.
[3492.04 → 3492.98] The language is there
[3492.98 → 3494.88] almost having our minds blown
[3494.88 → 3496.28] at the height,
[3496.42 → 3497.02] at the depth,
[3497.12 → 3497.86] at the length,
[3498.08 → 3499.32] at the breadth.
[3500.12 → 3500.66] In a sense,
[3501.00 → 3502.26] when we hear God's word
[3502.26 → 3502.62] and we're like,
[3502.84 → 3503.66] yeah, you know,
[3503.74 → 3504.28] I know it,
[3504.90 → 3505.96] it's actually the point
[3505.96 → 3507.02] of showing that we actually
[3507.02 → 3508.16] have lost touch
[3508.16 → 3510.30] with the insanity,
[3510.68 → 3511.88] the kind of beyond
[3511.88 → 3514.04] the radicalness
[3514.04 → 3514.94] of God's love
[3514.94 → 3516.22] for each one of us, right?
[3516.22 → 3517.16] The psalmist,
[3517.46 → 3518.26] trying to capture it,
[3518.32 → 3520.66] was his love is as high
[3520.66 → 3521.34] as the heavens
[3521.34 → 3522.46] are above the earth.
[3523.02 → 3523.72] Paul's saying,
[3524.08 → 3524.30] you know,
[3524.36 → 3525.00] nothing,
[3525.58 → 3528.16] no kind of heaven or hell,
[3528.32 → 3529.08] angels or demons,
[3529.42 → 3530.74] nothing can remove us
[3530.74 → 3532.14] from vital contact
[3532.14 → 3532.92] and intimacy
[3532.92 → 3534.14] with Jesus.
[3535.28 → 3536.08] But he also says
[3536.08 → 3537.34] that you might know
[3537.34 → 3538.20] this love,
[3538.48 → 3538.78] okay?
[3538.78 → 3541.90] We were actually meant
[3541.90 → 3543.04] to not only just
[3543.04 → 3543.94] take it for granted
[3543.94 → 3545.12] or know it rashly,
[3545.38 → 3546.84] but to experientially
[3546.84 → 3548.30] know and taste
[3548.30 → 3549.74] Christ's love for us
[3549.74 → 3550.32] personally.
[3551.60 → 3552.36] I think about
[3552.36 → 3554.02] the men,
[3554.18 → 3556.60] some of my uncles,
[3556.86 → 3557.56] my grandfather,
[3557.72 → 3558.30] my father,
[3558.74 → 3559.38] men who have had
[3559.38 → 3560.10] this kind of really
[3560.10 → 3561.82] solid theology,
[3562.64 → 3563.40] have had a really
[3563.40 → 3564.56] strong work ethic,
[3564.76 → 3565.74] a vibrant faith,
[3566.46 → 3567.70] but kind of as they have aged,
[3567.78 → 3568.26] kind of as they hit
[3568.26 → 3569.68] their 50s or 60s,
[3569.70 → 3570.26] they've developed
[3570.26 → 3571.74] this habit of not being
[3571.74 → 3572.40] able to finish
[3572.40 → 3573.48] their public prayers.
[3574.02 → 3574.82] They start talking
[3574.82 → 3575.54] about Jesus
[3575.54 → 3577.18] and the words get stuck
[3577.18 → 3578.56] in their mouths,
[3578.70 → 3579.66] their eyes get watery
[3579.66 → 3580.68] and they try to pull it together.
[3581.64 → 3582.36] And in some ways,
[3582.48 → 3583.72] yes, it might be nerves,
[3584.32 → 3585.24] but it also happens
[3585.24 → 3585.78] in private,
[3585.88 → 3587.42] away kind of off the stage.
[3587.88 → 3588.28] And yes,
[3588.30 → 3588.88] it might be that
[3588.88 → 3589.50] they're finally getting
[3589.50 → 3590.68] in touch with their emotions,
[3590.88 → 3591.34] praise the Lord,
[3591.72 → 3593.00] but I think it's also deeper.
[3593.90 → 3595.30] I think that their walk
[3595.30 → 3595.80] with the Lord
[3595.80 → 3597.48] is less of just a head thing
[3597.48 → 3598.34] and more and more
[3598.34 → 3600.10] of a head and heart thing.
[3601.40 → 3602.20] And so as we think about
[3602.20 → 3602.86] how do we actually
[3602.86 → 3603.88] step into that,
[3604.20 → 3606.08] I think to kind of
[3606.08 → 3606.80] enter this love
[3606.80 → 3608.02] does not happen by accident.
[3608.70 → 3609.60] It requires both
[3609.60 → 3611.16] imaginative reflection
[3611.16 → 3612.96] and spiritual practices.
[3613.76 → 3614.58] The late Tim Keller
[3614.58 → 3615.76] spoke of the need
[3615.76 → 3616.90] to find a metaphor
[3616.90 → 3618.38] that really connected
[3618.38 → 3619.48] to your own heart
[3619.48 → 3621.06] that connects Christ's work
[3621.06 → 3621.72] on the cross
[3621.72 → 3622.74] to your life,
[3622.78 → 3623.68] that makes it real.
[3623.68 → 3625.04] What is it that really
[3625.04 → 3626.30] captures your heart
[3626.30 → 3627.34] that kind of connects
[3627.34 → 3627.94] the dots?
[3628.60 → 3629.12] He shared that how
[3629.12 → 3630.20] one person who was
[3630.20 → 3630.88] really caught up
[3630.88 → 3631.68] in this temptation
[3631.68 → 3633.00] to make a reputation
[3633.00 → 3634.04] for himself,
[3634.74 → 3635.36] how his heart
[3635.36 → 3636.50] became transfixed
[3636.50 → 3637.78] by the fact that Christ
[3637.78 → 3639.38] gave up his reputation,
[3639.58 → 3640.68] laid down image
[3640.68 → 3641.86] and success and career
[3641.86 → 3642.94] for us,
[3642.98 → 3643.80] in pursuit of us.
[3644.94 → 3645.36] Also,
[3645.70 → 3645.96] how,
[3646.12 → 3646.28] I mean,
[3646.58 → 3648.16] I trust that we are praying,
[3648.32 → 3649.64] but how are you praying?
[3649.74 → 3650.52] In your prayers,
[3650.52 → 3652.28] is it just rattling off
[3652.28 → 3653.14] requests to God
[3653.14 → 3654.02] talking at him?
[3654.28 → 3655.28] Or is there space
[3655.28 → 3656.04] for you to listen
[3656.04 → 3657.56] to what Henry Noun says,
[3657.94 → 3659.38] that inner voice of love?
[3659.72 → 3660.54] Is there space for you
[3660.54 → 3661.70] to hear the Father's
[3661.70 → 3663.40] affirmation over you?
[3663.48 → 3664.50] Can you imagine prayer
[3664.50 → 3665.16] as a space,
[3665.68 → 3666.54] as John did,
[3666.58 → 3668.00] to lean his head
[3668.00 → 3669.20] on Christ's chest
[3669.20 → 3670.40] or to sit in the lap
[3670.40 → 3671.08] of the Father?
[3672.20 → 3673.20] St. Augustine says
[3673.20 → 3673.96] that God loves
[3673.96 → 3674.96] each one of us
[3674.96 → 3675.66] as if they were
[3675.66 → 3676.68] only one of us.
[3679.32 → 3680.08] Henry Noun,
[3680.08 → 3680.90] in the name of Jesus,
[3681.12 → 3682.68] kind of speaking to leaders,
[3683.50 → 3684.74] but I think also
[3684.74 → 3685.58] any Christian
[3685.58 → 3687.30] is kind of able
[3687.30 → 3688.30] to hear this challenge.
[3688.44 → 3688.78] He says,
[3689.14 → 3689.94] it's not enough
[3689.94 → 3691.34] for priests and ministers,
[3691.58 → 3692.78] let's say Christians as well,
[3693.12 → 3694.82] to just be moral people,
[3695.04 → 3695.68] well-trained,
[3695.84 → 3696.98] eager to help
[3696.98 → 3697.88] their fellow humans
[3697.88 → 3699.68] and able to respond creatively
[3699.68 → 3700.58] to the burning issues
[3700.58 → 3701.16] of their day.
[3701.64 → 3702.22] There are many people
[3702.22 → 3702.86] already out there
[3702.86 → 3703.40] like that.
[3704.08 → 3705.64] The central question is,
[3705.92 → 3706.62] are the leaders
[3706.62 → 3707.46] of the future
[3707.46 → 3708.74] truly men
[3708.74 → 3709.50] and women
[3709.50 → 3710.32] of God?
[3710.88 → 3712.60] People with an ardent desire,
[3713.10 → 3713.84] a burning desire
[3713.84 → 3714.50] to dwell
[3714.50 → 3715.54] in God's presence,
[3715.80 → 3717.40] to listen to God's voice,
[3717.60 → 3719.36] to look at God's beauty,
[3719.76 → 3720.70] to touch God's
[3720.70 → 3721.42] incarnate word
[3721.42 → 3722.80] and taste fully
[3722.80 → 3724.48] God's infinite goodness.
[3725.56 → 3725.94] The reality
[3725.94 → 3726.98] is that this is
[3726.98 → 3728.46] the primary vocation
[3728.46 → 3728.94] and calling
[3728.94 → 3729.86] behind any
[3729.86 → 3730.68] and all of our
[3730.68 → 3731.64] vocations
[3731.64 → 3732.70] and callings.
[3732.70 → 3733.96] God is meant
[3733.96 → 3734.36] for us
[3734.36 → 3735.06] to experience
[3735.06 → 3735.82] and walk
[3735.82 → 3737.04] in his love
[3737.04 → 3737.58] for us.
[3738.02 → 3739.30] His love
[3739.30 → 3739.94] that should blow
[3739.94 → 3740.78] our minds
[3740.78 → 3741.72] and deeply
[3741.72 → 3742.86] touch our hearts.
[3744.16 → 3744.62] And I think about
[3744.62 → 3745.16] kind of back
[3745.16 → 3745.74] to Jesus,
[3746.30 → 3747.56] Jesus really models
[3747.56 → 3749.00] this in his lifestyle.
[3749.30 → 3749.42] I mean,
[3749.46 → 3749.88] think about
[3749.88 → 3750.72] the moment
[3750.72 → 3751.58] where he's receiving
[3751.58 → 3753.02] baptism at the Jordan.
[3753.94 → 3754.16] Right?
[3754.22 → 3755.20] It's this amazing
[3755.20 → 3755.96] moment,
[3756.44 → 3756.82] but the reality
[3756.82 → 3757.40] is that Christ
[3757.40 → 3757.92] is not doing
[3757.92 → 3759.24] anything spectacular
[3759.24 → 3760.14] at this moment.
[3760.84 → 3761.24] The reality
[3761.24 → 3761.66] is that he's not
[3761.66 → 3762.34] even really doing
[3762.34 → 3763.40] much at all.
[3763.86 → 3764.66] He's really just
[3764.66 → 3765.28] receiving.
[3765.94 → 3766.40] He's letting
[3766.40 → 3767.66] John baptize him.
[3768.08 → 3768.78] He's listening
[3768.78 → 3769.50] to the words
[3769.50 → 3770.20] of the Father,
[3770.46 → 3771.20] you are my son
[3771.20 → 3771.84] whom I love.
[3772.14 → 3772.78] He's letting
[3772.78 → 3773.64] the Holy Spirit
[3773.64 → 3774.62] descend on him.
[3775.30 → 3775.82] He's not putting
[3775.82 → 3776.38] up a fight.
[3776.54 → 3777.66] He's not challenging.
[3777.86 → 3778.36] He's not saying,
[3778.64 → 3779.32] I'm not worthy
[3779.32 → 3780.16] or how could I
[3780.16 → 3781.28] or I don't deserve this.
[3781.48 → 3782.44] He's just simply
[3782.44 → 3782.96] saying,
[3783.12 → 3783.68] yes Lord,
[3783.90 → 3785.06] I receive that.
[3785.16 → 3786.02] I hear that.
[3786.26 → 3787.34] I let that in.
[3787.42 → 3788.60] I carry that with me.
[3789.64 → 3790.26] And I wonder how
[3790.26 → 3791.60] letting kind of
[3791.60 → 3792.32] Christ teach us
[3792.32 → 3792.96] how to receive
[3792.96 → 3793.66] this love from the
[3793.66 → 3794.76] Father might free
[3794.76 → 3795.60] us from the need
[3795.60 → 3796.56] for approval,
[3797.36 → 3798.56] for defensiveness,
[3799.10 → 3799.74] or performance
[3799.74 → 3800.32] identity,
[3800.68 → 3801.70] or image,
[3802.22 → 3803.30] or busyness.
[3803.72 → 3804.40] Where might this
[3804.40 → 3805.16] learn to receive
[3805.16 → 3806.20] the Father's love?
[3806.62 → 3806.84] In sense,
[3807.12 → 3808.26] to live from
[3808.26 → 3809.32] the Father's blessing,
[3809.46 → 3810.24] not have to work
[3810.24 → 3810.82] for it.
[3810.94 → 3811.04] Right?
[3811.04 → 3811.48] Detainments are
[3811.48 → 3812.44] tempted to live from.
[3812.76 → 3813.18] To kind of,
[3813.28 → 3813.76] how do we live
[3813.76 → 3814.34] from that,
[3814.42 → 3815.12] not for it?
[3815.12 → 3817.32] Thirdly,
[3817.34 → 3818.00] we see where this
[3818.00 → 3819.70] trust and power
[3819.70 → 3820.20] and love
[3820.20 → 3820.98] is taking us
[3820.98 → 3821.94] to verse 19.
[3822.88 → 3824.32] So that you may be
[3824.32 → 3826.04] filled to the measure
[3826.04 → 3827.48] of all the fullness
[3827.48 → 3828.50] of God.
[3829.52 → 3829.92] Or here,
[3830.04 → 3830.72] I do like the
[3830.72 → 3831.72] amplified version.
[3832.28 → 3833.46] So that you may have
[3833.46 → 3835.06] the richest experience
[3835.06 → 3836.50] of God's presence
[3836.50 → 3837.82] in your lives,
[3838.30 → 3839.52] completely filled
[3839.52 → 3840.40] and flooded
[3840.40 → 3841.86] with God himself.
[3843.12 → 3843.98] Does that sound amazing?
[3843.98 → 3845.38] That's possible
[3845.38 → 3846.10] for you and me.
[3846.66 → 3847.50] I think of the story
[3847.50 → 3849.00] of John of Kronstadt.
[3849.62 → 3850.98] He was a 19th century
[3850.98 → 3853.20] Russian Orthodox priest
[3853.20 → 3854.58] at a time when
[3854.58 → 3855.74] alcohol abuse
[3855.74 → 3856.68] was rampant.
[3857.70 → 3858.42] None of the priests
[3858.42 → 3859.12] around him
[3859.12 → 3860.04] would venture out
[3860.04 → 3860.74] of their churches
[3860.74 → 3863.36] to care for the loss
[3863.36 → 3864.14] and those who were
[3864.14 → 3865.08] struggling with alcohol.
[3865.64 → 3865.98] They would kind of
[3865.98 → 3866.54] wait for people
[3866.54 → 3867.38] to come to them.
[3868.18 → 3868.62] But John,
[3868.78 → 3869.96] compelled by love,
[3870.24 → 3870.80] would go out
[3870.80 → 3871.78] into the streets.
[3872.54 → 3873.72] He would lift
[3873.72 → 3874.66] or he would kind of
[3874.66 → 3875.28] cradle those
[3875.28 → 3876.12] who were hung over,
[3876.58 → 3877.60] kind of foul-smelling
[3877.60 → 3878.84] people from the gutter.
[3879.16 → 3879.96] He would hold them
[3879.96 → 3880.68] in his arms
[3880.68 → 3881.74] and he would say this,
[3882.18 → 3883.20] this is beneath
[3883.20 → 3884.22] your dignity.
[3885.00 → 3885.78] You were meant
[3885.78 → 3886.62] to house
[3886.62 → 3887.38] the fullness
[3887.38 → 3888.16] of God.
[3889.56 → 3890.10] Why don't you turn
[3890.10 → 3890.56] to a neighbour
[3890.56 → 3891.10] and say that?
[3891.16 → 3891.68] You were meant
[3891.68 → 3892.32] to house
[3892.32 → 3892.90] the fullness
[3892.90 → 3893.66] of God.
[3896.40 → 3896.84] Okay?
[3896.88 → 3897.34] You were meant
[3897.34 → 3897.90] to house
[3897.90 → 3898.50] the fullness
[3898.50 → 3899.82] of God.
[3902.14 → 3902.58] Ephesians,
[3902.86 → 3903.54] in case you don't
[3903.54 → 3904.18] believe me,
[3904.88 → 3905.76] my Bible has
[3905.76 → 3906.98] Ephesians 5.18
[3906.98 → 3908.12] where Paul commands
[3908.12 → 3908.72] the believers
[3908.72 → 3911.02] to be being filled
[3911.02 → 3912.74] with the Holy Spirit.
[3913.20 → 3913.36] Okay?
[3913.60 → 3914.52] Interesting Greek again.
[3914.78 → 3916.00] Be being filled.
[3916.42 → 3917.54] Not a get filled
[3917.54 → 3918.58] once and kind of
[3918.58 → 3919.26] call it a day
[3919.26 → 3920.32] or say I'm good now.
[3920.68 → 3921.48] We're all leaky
[3921.48 → 3921.92] vessels.
[3922.54 → 3923.12] And so we need
[3923.12 → 3923.60] the Holy Spirit
[3923.60 → 3924.52] to keep filling
[3924.52 → 3925.86] and refilling us
[3925.86 → 3927.58] to keep pouring
[3927.58 → 3928.76] out his loving,
[3929.34 → 3930.28] transforming work
[3930.28 → 3931.00] in our lives.
[3932.38 → 3932.66] Now,
[3932.88 → 3933.54] as I kind of
[3933.54 → 3934.02] think about
[3934.02 → 3934.44] or invite us
[3934.44 → 3935.10] to think about
[3935.10 → 3936.56] asking the Holy Spirit
[3936.56 → 3937.56] to fill us,
[3938.14 → 3939.24] I imagine
[3939.24 → 3939.80] that many of us
[3939.80 → 3940.72] might actually have
[3940.72 → 3941.46] reservations
[3941.46 → 3942.64] or fears.
[3943.12 → 3943.66] We might feel
[3943.66 → 3944.24] a bit nervous
[3944.24 → 3945.66] about that thought.
[3946.18 → 3946.92] Maybe you've heard
[3946.92 → 3948.14] unhealthy teaching
[3948.14 → 3950.06] or theology
[3950.06 → 3950.72] on the topic.
[3951.14 → 3952.02] Maybe you have
[3952.02 → 3952.88] had experience
[3952.88 → 3953.68] where it felt like,
[3953.74 → 3953.82] hey,
[3953.82 → 3954.54] if I didn't have
[3954.54 → 3955.20] what they have,
[3955.26 → 3956.08] I'm a second class
[3956.08 → 3956.64] Christian.
[3957.34 → 3958.06] Or you've seen
[3958.06 → 3958.88] kind of some
[3958.88 → 3960.06] Holy Spirit stuff
[3960.06 → 3960.62] that was like
[3960.62 → 3961.84] actually more emotion
[3961.84 → 3962.82] or drama
[3962.82 → 3963.74] than it was actually
[3963.74 → 3964.52] spiritual.
[3966.00 → 3966.42] But again,
[3966.62 → 3967.46] let's not let
[3967.46 → 3968.40] misuse
[3968.40 → 3969.34] or unhealthy
[3969.34 → 3970.36] theology or practice
[3970.36 → 3971.04] keep us from
[3971.04 → 3971.80] the real thing,
[3971.90 → 3972.64] from the healthy
[3972.64 → 3973.70] we're offered
[3973.70 → 3974.20] in Scripture.
[3975.10 → 3975.26] Right?
[3975.54 → 3976.24] Just think about
[3976.24 → 3977.10] biblically
[3977.10 → 3977.94] what happens
[3977.94 → 3979.00] when the Holy Spirit
[3979.00 → 3980.18] kind of is given
[3980.18 → 3981.76] permission and access
[3981.76 → 3982.40] to our hearts
[3982.40 → 3982.98] and lives.
[3982.98 → 3983.86] Right?
[3983.94 → 3985.52] Back to 2 Timothy 1.7.
[3985.66 → 3985.82] Right?
[3986.46 → 3987.60] We let the Holy Spirit
[3987.60 → 3987.74] in.
[3987.80 → 3988.48] We'll actually grow
[3988.48 → 3989.94] in love
[3989.94 → 3991.02] and power
[3991.02 → 3992.30] and self-discipline.
[3992.98 → 3993.76] Anybody need
[3993.76 → 3994.58] some more love
[3994.58 → 3995.22] and power
[3995.22 → 3996.12] and self-discipline?
[3997.86 → 3999.10] Or through the Spirit
[3999.10 → 4000.24] we see in Galatians 5,
[4000.62 → 4001.08] we end up
[4001.08 → 4002.58] less self-obsessed,
[4003.06 → 4004.08] more happy,
[4004.24 → 4005.22] exuberant for life,
[4005.58 → 4006.18] needing less
[4006.18 → 4007.32] to force our way
[4007.32 → 4008.46] or always be right.
[4008.46 → 4009.46] we end up
[4009.46 → 4010.52] more patient,
[4010.92 → 4011.62] more gentle,
[4011.94 → 4012.84] more peaceful,
[4013.30 → 4014.44] more persevering,
[4014.62 → 4015.20] more hopeful.
[4015.70 → 4016.60] Anybody need more
[4016.60 → 4017.06] of that
[4017.06 → 4017.74] in their hearts
[4017.74 → 4018.28] and lives?
[4019.14 → 4019.30] Right?
[4019.36 → 4020.28] Think about Romans 8.
[4020.82 → 4021.88] When through the Holy Spirit
[4021.88 → 4022.32] we cry,
[4022.42 → 4022.74] Abba,
[4022.84 → 4023.12] Father,
[4023.20 → 4024.14] we are given access,
[4024.14 → 4025.08] we are invited
[4025.08 → 4026.68] into this ongoing intimacy.
[4027.44 → 4027.78] We don't know
[4027.78 → 4028.36] how to pray.
[4028.50 → 4028.96] Anybody not know
[4028.96 → 4029.80] how to pray sometimes
[4029.80 → 4030.26] or often?
[4030.60 → 4030.88] You know,
[4030.98 → 4031.72] put my hand up.
[4032.12 → 4032.92] But the Holy Spirit
[4032.92 → 4033.92] is there to help us
[4033.92 → 4034.58] in our weakness
[4034.58 → 4035.66] to pray,
[4035.80 → 4036.74] to walk in that
[4036.74 → 4038.40] affection and strength
[4038.40 → 4039.02] of the Father.
[4039.64 → 4040.46] Or Romans 12,
[4040.96 → 4041.18] right?
[4041.42 → 4042.04] Through the Holy Spirit
[4042.04 → 4042.88] we are given gifts
[4042.88 → 4044.20] to serve powerfully,
[4044.58 → 4046.14] to have powerful impact
[4046.14 → 4047.38] in lives of witness
[4047.38 → 4047.94] and service
[4047.94 → 4048.58] in our neighbourhood
[4048.58 → 4049.70] and around the world.
[4050.40 → 4050.66] Right?
[4050.90 → 4052.14] I could continue,
[4052.74 → 4054.12] but I think we get the point.
[4054.52 → 4055.18] The reality is
[4055.18 → 4056.10] we actually have
[4056.10 → 4057.48] nothing to fear
[4057.48 → 4058.30] with inviting
[4058.30 → 4059.12] the Holy Spirit
[4059.12 → 4059.30] in.
[4059.36 → 4060.04] The Holy Spirit
[4060.04 → 4060.82] is good.
[4061.32 → 4062.22] He is trustworthy.
[4062.22 → 4065.88] And so I just want to say
[4065.88 → 4067.20] He won't make us,
[4067.26 → 4068.22] against our fears,
[4068.42 → 4069.86] He won't make us weird.
[4070.10 → 4071.10] He'll make us holy.
[4071.66 → 4073.02] He won't make us strange
[4073.02 → 4074.14] or something different
[4074.14 → 4075.20] or wacky than ourselves.
[4075.30 → 4075.88] He's going to make us
[4075.88 → 4077.40] more and more like Jesus
[4077.40 → 4078.62] and more and more
[4078.62 → 4080.08] ourselves in Jesus.
[4081.14 → 4081.98] So I'm wondering
[4081.98 → 4083.78] how might we
[4083.78 → 4085.08] and how might you
[4085.08 → 4085.60] as a community
[4085.60 → 4087.18] here at Hope
[4087.18 → 4088.68] invite the Lord
[4088.68 → 4089.64] and the Holy Spirit
[4089.64 → 4090.76] in further?
[4090.76 → 4092.52] For as someone said,
[4092.80 → 4094.10] we all have as much
[4094.10 → 4094.82] of God
[4094.82 → 4095.56] as we want
[4095.56 → 4096.40] in our lives.
[4097.38 → 4098.56] It's a bit of a sobering quote.
[4098.66 → 4099.82] We all have as much
[4099.82 → 4100.40] of God
[4100.40 → 4101.02] as we want
[4101.02 → 4102.04] in our lives.
[4103.00 → 4103.96] I reminded when I was
[4103.96 → 4104.42] praying
[4104.42 → 4106.72] for Redeemer University
[4106.72 → 4107.38] a few years ago
[4107.38 → 4108.04] and I had this
[4108.04 → 4108.88] very simple
[4108.88 → 4109.94] but stark image.
[4110.36 → 4110.90] This image of
[4110.90 → 4111.92] kind of God
[4111.92 → 4113.50] standing over us
[4113.50 → 4114.54] like this wave
[4114.54 → 4115.78] ready to pour
[4115.78 → 4116.72] Himself out
[4116.72 → 4117.56] upon us.
[4118.10 → 4119.10] And we as this community
[4119.10 → 4120.14] stood beneath Him
[4120.14 → 4120.88] with these really
[4120.88 → 4121.76] tiny cups.
[4123.54 → 4124.22] And it was like
[4124.22 → 4125.42] God was ready
[4125.42 → 4126.82] to give so much
[4126.82 → 4127.92] and we were ready
[4127.92 → 4128.60] to receive
[4128.60 → 4130.02] so little.
[4131.22 → 4132.06] The reality is
[4132.06 → 4132.94] that God's not
[4132.94 → 4133.96] going to force Himself
[4133.96 → 4135.64] into your and my life.
[4136.06 → 4136.82] If you want
[4136.82 → 4137.60] just a little bit
[4137.60 → 4138.42] of God
[4138.42 → 4139.66] He'll respect that.
[4140.06 → 4140.86] If you want to keep
[4140.86 → 4141.58] the Holy Spirit
[4141.58 → 4142.46] out there
[4142.46 → 4143.62] at arm's length
[4143.62 → 4144.74] you can do that.
[4145.32 → 4146.06] But we see that
[4146.06 → 4147.06] we see in James
[4147.06 → 4148.56] that if we draw
[4148.56 → 4150.08] near to the Lord
[4150.08 → 4151.32] He will draw near
[4151.32 → 4151.88] to us.
[4152.26 → 4153.06] He is ready
[4153.06 → 4153.76] to do more
[4153.76 → 4154.54] than we ask
[4154.54 → 4155.26] or imagine.
[4155.68 → 4156.70] He's ready to help us
[4156.70 → 4158.12] to receive the Father's love.
[4158.40 → 4159.50] He's ready to help us
[4159.50 → 4160.34] to grow in trust
[4160.34 → 4160.72] of Jesus.
[4161.10 → 4162.36] He's ready to help us
[4162.36 → 4163.64] walk in the fullness
[4163.64 → 4165.72] not just a dip
[4165.72 → 4166.44] or a dash
[4166.44 → 4166.82] of God
[4166.82 → 4167.52] but a fullness
[4167.52 → 4168.38] of the Spirit
[4168.38 → 4169.12] in our life.
[4170.30 → 4170.92] So I want to conclude
[4170.92 → 4171.52] by asking us
[4171.52 → 4172.28] some questions
[4172.28 → 4173.10] and giving us
[4173.10 → 4175.14] time to sit
[4175.14 → 4175.58] and pray
[4175.58 → 4176.42] whether individually
[4176.42 → 4177.40] or with a neighbour.
[4179.32 → 4180.74] Where might you
[4180.74 → 4182.00] need or desire
[4182.00 → 4182.86] the Holy Spirit
[4182.86 → 4184.12] strength in your life?
[4184.64 → 4185.58] Maybe it's in the area
[4185.58 → 4187.10] of trusting Jesus
[4187.10 → 4188.18] of letting Him
[4188.18 → 4189.42] of letting Him in
[4189.42 → 4190.10] of letting Him
[4190.10 → 4191.12] make Himself
[4191.12 → 4192.12] at home
[4192.12 → 4192.78] in your life.
[4193.50 → 4194.28] Maybe it's the struggle
[4194.28 → 4194.84] with kind of
[4194.84 → 4195.98] wavering faith.
[4196.68 → 4197.44] Maybe it's wrestling
[4197.44 → 4198.16] with doubts
[4198.16 → 4198.86] and questions.
[4199.48 → 4199.94] Maybe it's having
[4199.94 → 4200.58] a hard time
[4200.58 → 4201.74] releasing control
[4201.74 → 4202.50] to God
[4202.50 → 4203.48] or where you're
[4203.48 → 4204.70] tempted to cynicism
[4204.70 → 4206.66] or even lack of hope.
[4207.10 → 4207.90] The Holy Spirit
[4207.90 → 4209.10] is here to help you
[4209.10 → 4209.90] with this.
[4210.72 → 4212.22] Maybe it's with God's love.
[4212.62 → 4213.36] Maybe it doesn't really
[4213.36 → 4215.10] kind of move you anymore.
[4215.24 → 4215.94] Maybe you kind of
[4215.94 → 4217.34] think very little of it.
[4218.02 → 4218.68] Maybe you haven't
[4218.68 → 4219.88] tasted God's love
[4219.88 → 4221.12] for you experientially
[4221.12 → 4222.42] or haven't
[4222.42 → 4223.98] experienced that recently.
[4224.62 → 4225.28] Now it may not happen
[4225.28 → 4225.78] in this kind of
[4225.78 → 4226.78] flashy, you know
[4226.78 → 4227.70] crazy way
[4227.70 → 4228.28] but it might be
[4228.28 → 4228.84] the Holy Spirit
[4228.84 → 4229.54] whispering
[4229.54 → 4230.86] His I love you.
[4230.86 → 4231.96] You are mine.
[4232.16 → 4233.18] I've chosen you.
[4233.76 → 4233.92] You know?
[4234.44 → 4235.18] God speaking that
[4235.18 → 4235.86] you are my son
[4235.86 → 4236.20] or daughter
[4236.20 → 4236.82] whom I love
[4236.82 → 4237.78] with you, I'm well pleased.
[4237.88 → 4238.24] Maybe it's
[4238.24 → 4239.04] inviting the Spirit
[4239.04 → 4239.80] to remind us
[4239.80 → 4240.78] of the Father's love.
[4241.42 → 4242.04] Thirdly, maybe it's
[4242.04 → 4242.58] being filled
[4242.58 → 4243.18] with the Spirit.
[4243.82 → 4244.18] So I wonder
[4244.18 → 4245.20] where have you
[4245.20 → 4246.16] or I perhaps
[4246.16 → 4247.34] kept God out
[4247.34 → 4248.52] or at arm's length?
[4249.40 → 4249.96] Maybe it's in
[4249.96 → 4251.06] your mundane life
[4251.06 → 4251.52] or the things
[4251.52 → 4251.88] that you just
[4251.88 → 4252.48] kind of are bored.
[4252.52 → 4253.12] Maybe it's your
[4253.12 → 4253.50] commutes.
[4253.68 → 4254.08] Maybe it's your
[4254.08 → 4255.54] kind of longer commutes.
[4255.68 → 4256.30] Maybe it's certain
[4256.30 → 4256.92] relationships
[4256.92 → 4258.80] or career pursuits.
[4258.80 → 4259.86] Maybe it's certain
[4259.86 → 4260.40] struggles
[4260.40 → 4261.18] or fears
[4261.18 → 4262.08] or pains.
[4263.02 → 4263.70] God doesn't want
[4263.70 → 4264.70] to just rush in
[4264.70 → 4265.72] but how might you
[4265.72 → 4266.12] just say
[4266.12 → 4266.88] Jesus I just
[4266.88 → 4267.36] welcome you
[4267.36 → 4268.18] into this space.
[4268.30 → 4268.58] I don't know
[4268.58 → 4269.10] how to do that
[4269.10 → 4269.56] but I just
[4269.56 → 4270.38] welcome you here.
[4271.54 → 4271.78] So I just want
[4271.78 → 4272.68] to just pause
[4272.68 → 4273.52] and take two minutes
[4273.52 → 4274.10] and invite
[4274.10 → 4275.90] the band up
[4275.90 → 4276.80] or part of the band up
[4276.80 → 4277.44] to just kind of
[4277.44 → 4278.38] play in the background.
[4278.90 → 4279.12] I just want to
[4279.12 → 4279.80] invite you to
[4279.80 → 4280.90] simply say yes
[4280.90 → 4281.50] to Jesus.
[4281.76 → 4282.80] Yes to the Holy Spirit.
[4283.20 → 4284.06] Holy Spirit I invite
[4284.06 → 4284.78] you to come in
[4284.78 → 4285.80] or to come further in
[4285.80 → 4286.70] or just to help me
[4286.70 → 4287.76] to open myself
[4287.76 → 4288.36] to you
[4288.36 → 4289.32] and to let him
[4289.32 → 4289.84] do the work
[4289.84 → 4291.16] that only he can do.
[4291.80 → 4292.44] Let's just take time
[4292.44 → 4293.26] to pray now.
[4293.26 → 4293.64] Amen.
[4299.64 → 4301.32] Amen.
[4301.32 → 4331.30] piano plays softly
[4331.32 → 4361.30] piano plays softly
[4361.32 → 4391.30] piano plays softly
[4391.32 → 4421.30] piano plays softly
[4421.30 → 4433.30] piano plays softly
[4433.30 → 4434.82] Jesus, you are faithful.
[4435.14 → 4436.06] We can trust you.
[4436.70 → 4438.08] And Lord, we just ask that you would just,
[4438.76 → 4440.18] I think with the phrase that prayer is
[4440.18 → 4442.22] relaxing into God's goodness.
[4442.92 → 4444.42] Would we just unclench
[4444.42 → 4446.30] and just relax into your trustworthiness,
[4447.00 → 4447.84] your faithfulness.
[4448.64 → 4451.74] Lord, I thank you for the ways that you are already doing such powerful,
[4452.56 → 4454.12] strong, gentle work.
[4454.20 → 4455.76] Lord, thank you for the testimonies of healing.
[4455.88 → 4458.26] Lord, I appreciate the areas of answered prayer.
[4459.06 → 4462.06] Lord, we are so grateful for how you are at work, Lord,
[4462.10 → 4463.56] and yet we are also challenged, Lord,
[4463.56 → 4466.38] that you do immeasurably more than we ask or imagine.
[4467.38 → 4470.14] So Holy Spirit, we say thank you and more.
[4470.42 → 4471.96] We just want more of your presence,
[4472.20 → 4473.04] your power, your goodness.
[4473.04 → 4476.24] Would you fill us afresh and anew this morning, Lord,
[4476.26 → 4476.70] and this week.
[4476.78 → 4478.18] We pray this in Christ's name.
[4478.54 → 4478.86] Amen.
[4480.18 → 4483.18] Would you stand and join us as we sing Build My Life.
[4483.18 → 4513.16] We pray this in Christ.
[4513.16 → 4516.74] of all the praise we could ever bring
[4516.74 → 4523.44] Worthy of every breath we could ever bring
[4523.44 → 4526.24] We live for you
[4526.24 → 4537.80] Jesus, the name above every other name
[4537.80 → 4545.16] Jesus, the only one who could ever save
[4545.16 → 4552.12] Worthy of every breath we could ever bring
[4552.12 → 4554.80] We live for you
[4554.80 → 4557.80] Oh, we live for you
[4557.80 → 4565.60] Holy, there is no one like you
[4565.60 → 4568.60] There is none beside you
[4569.16 → 4573.96] Open up my eyes in wonder
[4573.96 → 4577.88] Show me who you are
[4577.88 → 4581.44] And fill me with your heart
[4581.44 → 4585.02] And lead me in your love
[4585.02 → 4588.48] To those around me
[4595.60 → 4601.32] Worthy of every song we could ever sing
[4601.32 → 4608.32] Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
[4608.32 → 4614.60] Worthy of every breath we could ever bring
[4615.16 → 4617.60] We live for you
[4617.60 → 4620.60] We live for you
[4620.60 → 4629.28] Jesus, the name above every other name
[4629.28 → 4636.22] Jesus, the only one who could ever save
[4636.22 → 4642.88] Worthy of every breath we could ever bring
[4642.88 → 4644.88] We live for you
[4644.88 → 4645.88] We live for you
[4645.88 → 4647.88] Oh, we live for you
[4647.88 → 4655.88] Holy, there is no one like you
[4655.88 → 4658.88] There is none beside you
[4658.88 → 4663.88] Open up my eyes in wonder
[4663.88 → 4666.88] And show me who you are
[4666.88 → 4667.88] Who you are
[4667.88 → 4670.88] And fill me with your heart
[4670.88 → 4674.88] And lead me in your love
[4674.88 → 4677.88] Through those around me
[4677.88 → 4697.88] I will build my life upon your love
[4697.88 → 4704.88] It is a firm foundation
[4704.88 → 4711.88] I will put my trust in your love
[4711.88 → 4713.88] I will put my trust in your love
[4713.88 → 4718.88] And I will not be shaken
[4718.88 → 4726.88] I will build my life upon your love
[4726.88 → 4733.88] It is a firm foundation
[4733.88 → 4737.88] I will put my trust in your love
[4737.88 → 4741.88] And I will not be shaken
[4741.88 → 4746.88] And I will not be shaken
[4746.88 → 4751.88] Holy, there is no one like you
[4751.88 → 4755.88] There is none beside you
[4755.88 → 4760.88] Open up my eyes in wonder
[4760.88 → 4763.88] Show me who you are
[4763.88 → 4764.88] Show me who you are
[4764.88 → 4767.88] And fill me with your heart
[4767.88 → 4770.88] And lead me in your love
[4770.88 → 4773.88] To those around me
[4773.88 → 4779.88] Holy, there is no one like you
[4779.88 → 4782.88] There is none beside you
[4782.88 → 4787.88] Open up my eyes in wonder
[4787.88 → 4790.88] Show me who you are
[4790.88 → 4794.88] And fill me with your heart
[4794.88 → 4797.88] And lead me in your love
[4797.88 → 4802.88] To those around me
[4802.88 → 4809.88] Open up my eyes in wonder
[4809.88 → 4812.88] And lead me in your love
[4812.88 → 4813.88] Thank you, Josiah, on preaching on Ephesians 3.
[4813.88 → 4814.88] As I was listening to Josiah, I was thinking to myself,
[4814.88 → 4820.88] One of the ways that Jesus reveals the depth and the height and the breadth of his love
[4820.88 → 4823.46] Thank you, Josiah, on preaching on Ephesians 3.
[4824.16 → 4826.30] As I was listening to Josiah, I was thinking to myself,
[4826.48 → 4832.72] one of the ways that Jesus reveals the depth and the height and the breadth of his love
[4832.72 → 4836.00] is in the meal of Lord's Supper.
[4837.22 → 4840.50] In fact, don't let it just wash over you or pass by you,
[4840.54 → 4844.04] that one of the ways Jesus commands us to remember
[4844.04 → 4847.92] the death and resurrection he has accomplished is through this meal.
[4848.90 → 4851.68] Last night in our family devotions with our kids,
[4852.12 → 4856.40] we were invited through this devotional to imagine Jesus' last supper with his disciples.
[4857.20 → 4860.08] And we were invited to imagine what was Jesus' posture,
[4860.94 → 4865.84] what was his facial expression as he led his disciples through a Passover meal.
[4865.84 → 4870.92] And I got the sense very strongly that he was filled with love.
[4871.96 → 4875.60] Love for his world, love for his church,
[4875.60 → 4877.98] love for those men around the table,
[4878.50 → 4880.72] that they would be filled with his love.
[4881.54 → 4884.30] And he knew that it would only be after his resurrection
[4884.30 → 4886.26] that they'd be able to break the bread and say,
[4886.42 → 4892.58] Ah, now I know the depth of Jesus' love through the cross.
[4892.58 → 4896.26] So brothers and sisters,
[4896.48 → 4898.02] on the night Jesus was betrayed,
[4898.74 → 4900.92] he took bread, and after he broke it,
[4900.96 → 4901.98] he said to his disciples,
[4902.22 → 4907.12] This is my body given for you.
[4908.16 → 4909.94] In the same way, he took the cup
[4909.94 → 4912.72] and after he poured it, he gave thanks saying,
[4912.86 → 4915.88] This is my bloodshed for you.
[4916.70 → 4919.26] Do this in remembrance of me.
[4919.26 → 4921.96] So whenever we as believers,
[4922.48 → 4924.46] along with the brothers and sisters around the world,
[4924.56 → 4927.42] whenever we break this bread and drink this cup,
[4927.80 → 4931.96] we remember that the body of Christ was given
[4931.96 → 4934.36] and the blood of Christ was shed
[4934.36 → 4938.84] for the complete forgiveness of all of our sins.
[4939.66 → 4941.46] Receive his grace in this meal.
[4941.46 → 4944.76] I feel the need to remind us as well
[4944.76 → 4946.32] that this small meal
[4946.32 → 4949.88] is a foretaste of what's coming.
[4950.52 → 4952.44] When Jesus describes his return
[4952.44 → 4953.62] and the renewal of all things,
[4953.68 → 4954.84] he describes it as what?
[4955.60 → 4956.36] A banquet.
[4957.42 → 4958.30] A feast.
[4959.24 → 4960.58] And there will come a day
[4960.58 → 4964.16] where we, with the body of Christ around the world,
[4964.78 → 4968.24] will dine and feast with Jesus Christ himself,
[4968.88 → 4970.72] the host of this meal.
[4971.72 → 4973.94] Christ is present with us this morning
[4973.94 → 4976.42] and he invites all of us who believe
[4976.42 → 4979.38] that Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour in life
[4979.38 → 4983.84] to receive this nourishment from the body and blood.
[4984.46 → 4985.66] If you believe in him,
[4985.88 → 4989.68] you are welcome to receive this grace.
[4990.82 → 4992.10] If you're new to Hope Community Church,
[4992.36 → 4994.68] we have four stations at the front and the back.
[4994.96 → 4997.00] Our elders and deacons will be serving the elements.
[4997.42 → 4999.28] You can receive those elements from them,
[4999.28 → 5000.76] take them back to your chairs.
[5001.20 → 5002.50] You can take them with your family,
[5002.62 → 5004.12] teach your kids what this meal means.
[5004.56 → 5005.58] Spend time in prayer.
[5006.12 → 5007.88] Our worship team will be singing a song
[5007.88 → 5009.26] that is fairly new to our church,
[5009.52 → 5011.60] but if you want to sing, you can sing.
[5012.56 → 5017.00] Allow the body of Christ to nourish the body of Christ.
[5017.00 → 5018.38] Come and receive his grace.
[5018.38 → 5018.40] Come and receive his grace.
[5047.00 → 5064.54] You can reach out and touch the hem of your God.
[5064.54 → 5078.54] Help me, heal me, heal me, my mind, my body and soul.
[5078.54 → 5086.30] Let the King, the Son, living Word, may flash.
[5086.96 → 5093.20] Lift this heavy heart to your throne, O God.
[5093.20 → 5096.64] In your knees I died,
[5096.64 → 5100.42] He knew for all I died,
[5100.42 → 5109.20] When from grace I found Christ was always to.
[5109.20 → 5122.20] I'm hungry, lonely, Jesus waits in the body.
[5122.20 → 5134.20] I'm hungry, lonely, Jesus waits in the body.
[5134.20 → 5142.20] My Saviour suffers with me.
[5142.20 → 5148.20] With Him, I'll rise again.
[5148.20 → 5153.20] Let the King, the King, the King, the King, the Holy Spirit.
[5153.20 → 5155.42] Living Word, may flash.
[5155.42 → 5162.22] Lift this heavy heart to your throne, O God.
[5162.22 → 5168.92] In your world I find for all I'm glad.
[5168.92 → 5175.92] When from grace I found Christ was always to.
[5175.92 → 5183.68] Let the King, the King, the King, the King, the King, the King, the King, the King.
[5183.68 → 5188.38] Let the King be sent for all I'm glad.
[5188.38 → 5192.66] Lord God, in your wounds I find
[5192.66 → 5195.98] Good for all of mine
[5195.98 → 5199.60] And from place I know
[5199.60 → 5202.66] Christ was lower
[5202.66 → 5206.42] Till the earth is here
[5206.42 → 5209.48] Christ is lower
[5209.48 → 5211.36] Sin
[5218.38 → 5225.48] We lift it all up to you
[5226.26 → 5232.70] We lift it all up to you
[5234.48 → 5237.90] We lift it all up to you
[5242.96 → 5244.96] We lift it all up to you
[5244.96 → 5246.92] We lift our dreams
[5246.92 → 5251.92] We lift our plans. We lift it up to You.
[5251.92 → 5258.92] We lift our sorrow and our pain. We lift it up to You.
[5258.92 → 5265.92] We cast our cares on You again. We lift it up to You.
[5265.92 → 5270.92] We cast our cares on You again.
[5270.92 → 5277.92] Let the King descend. The living word may flash.
[5277.92 → 5284.92] Lift His heavy heart to Your throne, O God.
[5284.92 → 5290.92] In Your wounds I find. For all of mine,
[5290.92 → 5297.92] and from praise I crown. Christ was Lord.
[5297.92 → 5304.92] Let the King descend. The living word may flash.
[5304.92 → 5311.92] Lift His heavy heart to Your throne, O God.
[5311.92 → 5317.92] In Your wounds I find. For all of mine,
[5317.92 → 5324.92] and from praise I crown. Christ was Lord.
[5324.92 → 5332.92] Till the earth is here. Christ is Lord.
[5332.92 → 5334.92] Still.
[5334.92 → 5340.92] In Your wounds I find. For all of mine.
[5341.92 → 5345.92] In Your wounds I find. For all of mine.
[5345.92 → 5358.66] Well, we've been nurtured and nourished by the word, by worship, and by the meal.
[5358.66 → 5361.84] And I now invite you to stand to receive God's blessing.
[5366.44 → 5369.76] I want to make just two quick points before we receive that blessing.
[5369.88 → 5372.88] Number one, there is Cobb's bread on the tables, I hope.
[5373.02 → 5374.40] Maybe you already took it on your way in.
[5374.40 → 5376.50] But I do encourage you, take some bread home.
[5377.24 → 5379.16] Invite some people over and practice hospitality.
[5380.24 → 5385.02] Secondly, one of the ways that we worship, in fact, I would even call it a spiritual discipline, is the practice of giving.
[5385.76 → 5389.12] And if you're new to Hope, just so you know, there are lots of ways we can give.
[5389.74 → 5393.00] You can talk to one of the deacons at the back, right beside the coffee bar.
[5393.40 → 5397.86] And you can talk about ways you can give and get behind the ministry that this church is up to in our city
[5397.86 → 5400.84] and the way we seek to bear witness to Christ in this place.
[5400.84 → 5410.68] We just sang of the self-lowering love of Jesus Christ, and we're now sent to serve the needs of our city,
[5411.06 → 5415.32] to wash the feet of our coworkers, to raise our kids, to follow in the way of Jesus.
[5415.62 → 5417.76] And we cannot do that in our own strength.
[5418.32 → 5420.06] We cannot do that by our own power.
[5420.14 → 5424.50] But good news, church, God himself goes with us, and he goes before us.
[5424.50 → 5426.10] So receive his blessing.
[5427.52 → 5430.64] I'm going to read these words, by the way, from Romans chapter 5.
[5431.58 → 5437.34] Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
[5437.66 → 5442.72] through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.
[5443.44 → 5447.30] And we boast in hope of the glory of God.
[5447.30 → 5454.02] Not only so, but we also glory in our suffering because we know that suffering produces perseverance.
[5455.22 → 5458.00] Perseverance, character, and character, hope.
[5458.52 → 5464.70] And hope does not put us to shame because God's love has been poured into our hearts
[5464.70 → 5468.60] through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
[5469.98 → 5473.08] Church of Jesus Christ, go in the love of the Father.
[5473.08 → 5478.26] Father, go in the grace of Jesus Christ that has met us all the way through the work on the cross.
[5478.68 → 5481.94] And go in the fellowship and power of the Holy Spirit.
[5482.08 → 5483.60] Together we say, Amen.
[5483.82 → 5485.30] Let's sing our final song together.
[5485.72 → 5487.22] You're allowed to clap for this one.
[5488.42 → 5490.96] This song, we haven't sung it for a couple of years,
[5491.12 → 5495.10] and you may need a refresher on the pronunciation because the first verse is in Zulu.
[5495.98 → 5497.20] And that goes like this.
[5497.26 → 5498.42] It's simpler than it looks.
[5499.30 → 5501.66] SIA samba, which means let's go.
[5501.66 → 5506.12] So, taken yen, which means in the light.
[5506.84 → 5509.30] Keen KOS means of the king.
[5509.90 → 5511.36] So we're going in the light of the king.
[5511.56 → 5514.16] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5514.66 → 5515.66] Let's sing this together.
[5515.66 → 5531.32] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5531.50 → 5532.22] That's all it is.
[5532.22 → 5536.18] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5536.18 → 5539.78] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5539.78 → 5547.24] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5547.24 → 5549.24] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5549.24 → 5551.24] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5551.24 → 5554.24] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5554.24 → 5556.24] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5556.24 → 5561.24] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5561.24 → 5563.24] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5563.24 → 5584.18] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5584.24 → 5584.70] V Sasha, k Arte, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5585.24 → 5587.64] SIA samba, taken yen, keen KOS.
[5587.64 → 5590.32] you
[5617.64 → 5631.64] is
[5632.68 → 5645.64] we are

[5701.64 → 5705.64] we are
[5705.64 → 5707.64] we are
[5707.64 → 5709.64] we are
[5709.64 → 5729.64] we are
