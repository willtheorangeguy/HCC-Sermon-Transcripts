[0.00 → 17.98] well if you've been travelling with us through advent you'll know that we've been looking at
[17.98 → 23.30] these words of waiting words of hope of joy of peace and this morning we're looking at that big
[23.30 → 28.60] word of love, and we're going to read from the old and the New Testament so if you have your bible
[28.60 → 33.36] turn with me to exodus 34 we're going to read a portion of that, and then we're going to go over
[33.36 → 39.60] to one of the small john books at the back first john 3 and read the New Testament teaching on love
[39.60 → 49.96] this first part in exodus is after Moses receives the 10 commandments a second time from the lord
[49.96 → 58.08] so Moses chiselled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up mount Sinai early in the
[58.08 → 62.84] morning as the lord had commanded him, and he carried these two stone tablets in his hand
[62.84 → 68.66] then the lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name the lord
[68.66 → 76.60] and he passed in front of Moses proclaiming the lord the compassionate and gracious god
[76.60 → 84.86] slow to anger abounding in love and faithfulness maintaining love to thousands and forgiving
[84.86 → 91.22] wickedness rebellion and sin, and it does not leave the guilty unpunished he punishes the children and
[91.22 → 97.48] their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation now over to first john
[97.48 → 109.16] this is how we know what love is Jesus Christ laid down his life for us
[109.16 → 115.22] and we ought to lay down our lives for one another if any one of you has material possessions and sees
[115.22 → 122.16] a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them how can the love of god be in you dear children
[122.16 → 129.56] let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth this is god's word
[129.56 → 138.10] well in the video at the beginning of the service it was mentioned that love is a very hard word to define
[138.10 → 144.68] because we use it so broadly right we love pizza we love our pets, and we love our spouse
[144.68 → 150.46] but you can't love all three of those in the same way and if you do, we have a marriage course coming
[150.46 → 156.40] up on January 6, and you are very strongly encouraged to attend and do not bring your pet to that
[156.40 → 162.00] if you've been around the church long enough you'll know that love is one of those big Christian words
[162.00 → 169.26] right we talk about how god is love how we are commanded to love god and love neighbour but we
[169.26 → 175.76] want to be clear about what we mean when we say to love and part of why this matters is because we live
[175.76 → 180.84] in a context in the western society where we have a certain imagination around the word love and I would
[180.84 → 185.20] I would suggest that the first thing that comes to your in my mind when we say love is a feeling
[185.20 → 190.64] I was going to give some illustrations with words and lyrics and music but Jonathan totally stole
[190.64 → 194.82] that last week so I'm not going to do that but I think you'll agree with me that most of the ways
[194.82 → 200.88] that we sing and hear media depict love is a feeling, and we're going to see this morning that biblical
[200.88 → 207.90] love is much bigger and deeper and stronger than feelings, and we're going to start by looking at
[207.90 → 214.40] exodus the time that we encounter god speaking about his love first and perhaps most prominently
[214.40 → 220.20] is an exodus is a very important book of the bible very important book of the Old Testament
[220.20 → 225.20] actually sets the stage really for the rest of the Old Testament story it's a book where god doesn't
[225.20 → 232.64] mind his own business he hears the oppression of his people Israel as they are enslaved by the world empire
[232.64 → 241.44] of the day under pharaoh and god literally shows up in this world power, and he shows how much power he has
[241.44 → 248.28] exercises plagues over Egypt so that he can rescue this tiny little powerless slave nation and bring
[248.28 → 253.84] them to himself, and it's after he begins to teach them and instruct them because they have no idea who
[253.84 → 260.92] god is they've been in oppression for 400 years and as he shares who he is we read exodus 34 and before
[260.92 → 265.14] I read this passage a second time I want to say two things about this passage number one
[265.14 → 273.38] this is the most quoted verse in the bible by the bible that is to say exodus 34 these verses are
[273.38 → 278.28] repeated over and over again in the psalms and the prophets and the New Testament you might say
[278.28 → 286.42] that these words are the anthem of the bible secondly this is god talking about himself
[286.42 → 293.50] these are not just words that Moses is writing about god this is god saying to Moses this is who I am
[293.50 → 299.14] okay so in light of that I want to read again what we read god saying about himself in exodus 34
[299.14 → 307.72] and he passed that's the lord passed in front of Moses proclaiming the lord the compassionate
[307.72 → 315.88] and gracious god slow to anger and abounding in love and faithfulness maintaining love to thousands
[315.88 → 322.36] and forgiving wickedness rebellion and sin, yet he does not leave guilty unpunished he punishes the
[322.36 → 327.34] children and their children for the sin of the parents of the third and fourth generation I want
[327.34 → 332.12] to touch on that last part but I do not have time but I want to highlight how even the justice of god
[332.12 → 337.42] is found within his mercy and love and I'm hoping actually that we come back to a sermon series on this
[337.42 → 344.88] next year but for today I'm going to focus on that one line where god says he is slow to anger
[344.88 → 354.14] and abounding in love and faithfulness you should know that the Hebrew word for love there is heed
[354.14 → 358.44] and if you happen to be with us earlier when we preach through the book of Ruth you'll know that heed
[358.44 → 363.98] is a very important word translated in a variety of ways and rut hit's kindness but here's three main
[363.98 → 368.14] ways we need to understand the love of god in the Old Testament from the Hebrew the first is
[368.14 → 377.76] it is loyal unfailing love secondly it's promise keeping love, and thirdly it's covenant faithfulness
[377.76 → 382.04] and the image I gave in the 9 a.m service will say it again it's almost as if god is standing at the
[382.04 → 389.00] altar with his world and his people, and he makes promises to do something very good for the world and
[389.00 → 397.42] for them and no matter what comes he will be loyal to his vow it's a covenant faithfulness love
[397.42 → 409.76] and this is god saying that is who i am slow to anger and abounding in love and faithfulness
[409.76 → 415.18] and I think just like the Israelites if we're honest it takes us a while to believe this
[415.18 → 419.58] especially as we go through struggle and conflict, and we look around the world at the mess and we
[419.58 → 424.40] think okay how is this true, and it takes time for us to move from just having in our heads that god is
[424.40 → 429.28] love to it being part of our hearts and our bodies that we truly believe in the core of our being
[429.28 → 437.28] that god is for you, he's not petty and vindictive he is not retributive and quick to pounce on you for
[437.28 → 443.36] all your wrongdoings he is slow to anger and abounding in love do you believe this
[443.36 → 449.36] next year starting in January we're going to do a series that actually works the way through the old
[449.36 → 456.88] testament, and we're going to see how in real time in concrete normal life god shows up in his said love
[456.88 → 464.04] how he constantly works out his good purposes and his character even when he's rejected by his people
[464.04 → 469.96] right now my kids are reading through different portions of the bible and I'm learning that what
[469.96 → 474.36] every Christian parent learns is that you really want your kids to read the bible, but there's certain
[474.36 → 481.54] books of the bible when they start reading through you're like here we go one of those books is
[481.54 → 485.62] judges I don't know if you've read through that book lately, but that's not a kid-friendly book of
[485.62 → 489.88] the bible, and you're reading along with your kids, and you're sort of making sense of it and talking
[489.88 → 497.96] through it and I asked myself at certain points why is this in the bible it is so violent
[497.96 → 505.92] it is so rebellious, and it is so vile where god's people they basically receive his instruction he
[505.92 → 510.68] leads them he promises all these good things to him, and then they turn to him they say no thanks
[510.68 → 517.66] we don't want you we don't need you we would rather have kings like the other nations than be under your
[517.66 → 527.00] rule and there is just painful violent brutal rejection of god and even there god is faithful
[527.00 → 534.08] even there god does not give up on his love and his promise and his goodness to his people it's
[534.08 → 539.68] staggering and I think when we start to forget the reality and the brutality of the Old Testament story
[539.68 → 544.24] and we sort of think of god's love as sort of this ethereal thing that's disconnected from concrete
[544.24 → 550.82] living we forget just how powerful and real god's love is
[550.82 → 561.74] and of course now we get to understanding why Jesus himself came god does not give up on his world
[561.74 → 566.98] and he does not give up on his people and before I read our reading from the New Testament I want to
[566.98 → 572.62] give us a section from a statement called the contemporary testimony this is a sort of articulation
[572.62 → 577.04] that comes from our denomination on the character of god and also the story of the bible and this is a
[577.04 → 585.46] summary of god's character in the Old Testament and I love it we read while justly angry god did not
[585.46 → 596.10] turn away from a world bent on destruction but turned to face it in love with patience and tender care
[596.10 → 604.96] the lord set out on a long road of redemption to reclaim the lost as his people and the world as his
[604.96 → 611.24] kingdom like a husband at the altar even when he's facing unfaithfulness god says I will not forgive
[611.24 → 617.18] or give up on my promises the promise I made in genesis 3 to crush the head of the serpent the promise
[617.18 → 622.40] I made in genesis 12 to bring blessing where there is curse in the world the promise I made to David in
[622.40 → 628.94] second Samuel 7 to put a king on the throne of the world who would truly rule with justice and peace
[628.94 → 637.10] and with mercy god will make his way and he will be good on those promises and the reason we're here
[637.10 → 646.50] is because he did god shows up in love and faithfulness even in the brokenness of the world
[646.50 → 652.40] and that's precisely when Jesus came by the way he came into a world that was violent and brutal and
[652.40 → 657.84] rejected him there was already a price on his head to be murdered by Herod before he was born
[657.84 → 666.24] that's the world Jesus was coming into and that's why he was sent god reveals the fullness of his
[666.24 → 673.36] plan in Jesus, and he reveals the fullness of his loving character in Jesus to be seen to be heard to be
[673.36 → 679.56] held to be eaten meals with Jesus is a visible portrayal of the fullness of god's love
[679.56 → 685.62] some of you may have heard this illustration before but I'll share it again it's from Phil Bianca
[685.62 → 692.26] and he talks about um owning an aquarium any fish owners here talks about how no matter what he did
[692.26 → 697.88] with this aquarium these fish were afraid of him, and so I'm going to just read how he summarizes this
[697.88 → 705.28] experience of owning an aquarium he writes I ran a portable chemical laboratory to monitor the nitrate
[705.28 → 712.12] levels and ammonia content I pumped vitamins and antibiotics sulfa drugs enough to make a rock grow
[712.12 → 717.56] I filtered the water and exposed it to ultraviolet light you would think that my fish would be
[717.56 → 724.48] grateful not so every time my shadow loomed above the tank they swam for cover to the nearest shell
[724.48 → 732.20] they showed one emotion only fear although I opened the lid and dropped in food regularly they responded
[732.20 → 739.32] to each visit as a sure sign that I was going to torture them they thought I was not for them, I could
[739.32 → 746.04] not convince my fish that I was good I was too large for them my actions too incomprehensible
[746.04 → 751.08] my acts of mercy they saw as cruelty my attempts at healing they viewed as destruction
[751.08 → 758.44] to change their perceptions I began to see that what was required was a form of incarnation
[758.44 → 766.60] I would have to become a fish and speak to them in their language so they could see that I was good
[768.28 → 777.00] that is the story of the incarnation Jesus coming into a world that did not understand him that actually
[777.00 → 782.84] chose to reject him and because of sin could not actually take into their hearts and their minds the
[782.84 → 792.28] goodness and the love of god and so god comes in their form as flesh so they could see and hear and
[792.28 → 797.88] experience the love of the father in human form
[800.68 → 807.32] I think of those words those famous words in john 3 16 you probably know 16 but I want to read 17 as
[807.32 → 815.48] well where we read for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in
[815.48 → 823.08] him shall not perish but have eternal life for god did not send his son in the world to condemn the world
[823.08 → 830.12] but to save the world through him and now I'm going to read our passage again from first john 3
[830.76 → 833.96] a beautiful maybe one of my favourite descriptions of love in the New Testament
[833.96 → 842.60] first john reads this is how we know what love is Jesus Christ laid down his love for us, and we ought
[842.60 → 847.96] to lay down our lives for our brothers and our sisters if anyone has material possessions and sees a
[847.96 → 854.92] brother or sister in need but has no pity on them how can the love of god be in that person dear children
[854.92 → 860.44] let us not love with words and for our culture of words this is such an important line let us not love
[860.44 → 870.92] with words or speech but with actions and in truth this is how we know what love is over and against
[870.92 → 877.00] whatever cultural perceptions and whatever media depictions of what love is god reveals what love is
[877.00 → 885.24] through Jesus, and he says the greatest act of love ever seen in the world in all history is Jesus
[885.24 → 895.40] coming fully god fully man and voluntarily laying down his life for his world for his people and for
[895.40 → 901.00] his enemies and I don't want this to be missed by any one of us the world in the Old Testament story had
[901.00 → 907.32] said no thank you to god we don't want you and then god's people who were set aside from him joined the
[907.32 → 913.24] world and said to god no, thank you we don't want you we want to be like the world and even leading up to
[913.24 → 922.28] his crucifixion god's own people were chanting with the rest crucify Jesus and instead of retaliating
[922.28 → 929.48] against his world instead of judging his people what does Jesus do he voluntarily lays down his life
[930.36 → 938.60] for the world for you and me and for his enemies praise the lord that is god's love
[938.60 → 947.64] that is agape sacrificial love and the reason we're here this morning don't let this be missed by any
[947.64 → 955.16] one of us is in some way god's love melted your heart and mine in such a way that we move from enemy
[955.80 → 961.40] to child in fact after the 9 a.m service someone came up to me, and they said that's such a simple
[961.40 → 965.88] sermon, but you know what that's how I became a Christian my mom invited me to church and out of
[965.88 → 970.60] obligation to my mom I came to church I heard a message about how god is love and god worked in my
[970.60 → 977.96] life and if that's your story pursue this because what I'm saying is not just words it's god's love
[977.96 → 983.16] in reality through the person of Jesus Christ who has given everything for you and for me
[984.76 → 991.00] dale Brunner a favourite commentator of mine he summarizes the love of Jesus in this way and i just
[991.00 → 997.64] think this says it really well he says in god's single greatest act of self-disclosure ever greater
[997.64 → 1005.56] even than his continuous acts of creation god loved his enemy world so much that he gave his own son
[1006.44 → 1017.00] god the cross teaches us supremely is the greatest enemy lover of all time that's why we sing every
[1017.00 → 1025.24] Sunday that's why we worship that's why we gather as the church god's love is has said it is gritty
[1025.24 → 1033.32] sacrificial committed faithful love even in the face of faithlessness and rejection, and it shows up in
[1033.32 → 1039.64] and through the mighty power of Jesus and the question I want to ask for the rest of our time together
[1039.64 → 1047.16] is what does our love look like we may know and have heard that this is the way god shows his love
[1047.16 → 1053.16] what does our love look like what does our love look like in the concrete realities of our families
[1053.16 → 1060.84] our friendships our co-workers and our neighbours does it look like god's love does it look like has said
[1060.84 → 1067.64] does it look like the sacrificial agape love of Jesus I want to come back to quote dale Brunner again
[1067.64 → 1073.40] where he says it this way and this gets at the second half of john first john 3 where he talks
[1073.40 → 1079.32] about how we are to mirror the love of Jesus he writes what makes Christian Christians salty being
[1079.32 → 1086.20] the salt of the world different and useful in the meat of the world is they're breaking the world's code
[1086.84 → 1095.64] of love for love good for good and evil for evil reciprocity it is the Christian counter grain
[1095.64 → 1102.44] counter-cultural love for the undeserving the unloving and even the positively hostile
[1103.08 → 1106.12] that makes them recognizably Christian
[1108.76 → 1115.16] I love that quote and at the same time it is so hard to live into this isn't it because the way
[1115.16 → 1119.48] of the world, and we know this is in our bones so often when we are hurt we retaliate when
[1119.48 → 1124.12] someone speaks poorly of them we attack them with our words when someone cuts us off we cut them off
[1124.12 → 1129.16] when they hurt us we hurt them right that's the way of the world and the way of Jesus breaks the code
[1129.96 → 1136.76] of the way of the world it is love for the unloving hospitable towards the unloving it is showing a
[1136.76 → 1142.20] different way of being towards even those who are hostile and unkind and here's my question for you
[1143.80 → 1151.16] who's coming to your mind as you hear this I've learned that usually doesn't take long for us to
[1151.16 → 1154.68] think about who are the people we struggle with maybe they're sitting around your dinner table
[1154.68 → 1158.60] over the Christmas break right that family member who knows how to grind your gears
[1159.16 → 1164.44] that sibling who you just think oh or the co-worker maybe who's made this a very hard year
[1164.44 → 1169.64] for year who takes advantage of your work for their own gain the neighbour who mocks you for being
[1169.64 → 1175.32] someone who follows this Jesus fable who's the enemy who comes up in your mind and then here's the
[1175.32 → 1183.40] question what does agape have said love look like in that relationship what might the spirit of the
[1183.40 → 1191.80] living god might be inviting you to do not just to say but to do as an act of loving your neighbour
[1191.80 → 1197.64] which includes your political enemy your social enemy your work enemy and all the rest
[1197.64 → 1205.48] I want to suggest number one that this is not easy it requires prayer and the power of the spirit
[1205.48 → 1209.00] nor does it mean you have to have soft mushy feelings towards that person you struggle with
[1209.96 → 1215.64] but you don't even have to like them to love them, but you're probably going to have to get close to them
[1215.64 → 1219.48] I've learned at least in my own experience the experience of many people in our church that it's hard
[1219.48 → 1226.36] to love someone at a distance and concrete love often takes showing up being present speaking and
[1226.36 → 1231.56] living in a way that's going to be noticed and seen it takes strategizing prayerfully about how
[1231.56 → 1236.52] they need to hear the love of Jesus through your action in this concrete reality in this meal in this
[1236.52 → 1243.08] workplace situation in this neighbourhood what might the spirit of god be inviting you into over the
[1243.08 → 1249.48] Christmas season I know for many of us the Christmas meal is a complicated one I know for some of us we
[1249.48 → 1253.72] dread the holidays or there's grief and pain, and we don't want to be with people, but perhaps this is
[1253.72 → 1262.12] precisely the time when we prayerfully strategically pray and ask god to make us people who demonstrate
[1262.84 → 1270.84] the sacrificial gritty committed selfless love of Jesus Christ the same love that we have received
[1270.84 → 1276.52] in abundance that has turned us from enemy into child that love might be the way that we show for the
[1276.52 → 1283.64] first time what Jesus love looks like in our families in our neighbourhoods in our workplaces
[1284.52 → 1289.48] and trust me when I say when you invite god to give you the strength to do it when you ask him for the
[1289.48 → 1296.52] ability and the creativity and the guts to show love in the hard places he shows up with strength opens up
[1296.52 → 1304.52] opportunities because it is his desire that the love of Jesus Christ be made concrete in our lives in such a way that it points
[1304.52 → 1310.60] our world to the love of Jesus that has come would you let me lead us in prayer
[1320.68 → 1328.68] father we thank you that you are love, and it is because of your love that we are here we thank you that
[1328.68 → 1333.88] you did not give up on us in our rebellion you did not give up on your world and its rejection
[1334.76 → 1341.80] and we praise you that you have come in and through your son Jesus we thank you for the way that his love
[1341.80 → 1349.72] in some way continues to melt us and change us and affect us and our prayer this morning is that we would
[1349.72 → 1356.76] reflect that love in concrete ways I pray that you would already now go ahead of us this week in the meal
[1356.76 → 1363.88] sharing, and the time spent with family and friends and co-workers and use us as a source of agape chased
[1363.88 → 1371.88] love so that people would see us and in and through us, they would see your love and give their lives to you
[1373.00 → 1379.88] we pray this in the mighty name of Jesus amen would you stand and sing with me our song of response
