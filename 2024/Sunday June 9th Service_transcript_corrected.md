[1109.86 → 1139.84] And on the day,
[1139.86 → 1169.84] And you're in the day,
[1169.84 → 1199.82] Thank you.
[1199.82 → 1229.80] Lord, I'll worship you.
[1229.82 → 1259.80] Hosanna, I see the Lord, I see the Lord, I see the Lord, I see the Lord, I see the King of glory.
[1259.80 → 1289.80] That the Lord, I see the Lord, I Pele, but IN Benin'
[1289.80 → 1301.80] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1303.80 → 1313.80] Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.
[1313.80 → 1328.80] I've seen a generation rising up to take their place with selfless faith.
[1328.80 → 1332.80] With selfless faith.
[1332.80 → 1339.52] I see the near revival
[1339.52 → 1345.36] Stirring as we plant seed
[1345.36 → 1349.10] We're on our knees
[1349.10 → 1353.32] We're on our knees
[1353.32 → 1358.82] Hosanna, Hosanna
[1358.82 → 1364.50] Hosanna in the highest
[1364.50 → 1371.32] Hosanna, Hosanna
[1371.32 → 1376.34] Hosanna in the highest
[1376.34 → 1386.34] Heal my heart and make it bleed
[1386.34 → 1393.52] Open out my eyes to the things unseen
[1393.52 → 1398.58] Show me how to love like you
[1398.58 → 1403.34] How love me
[1403.34 → 1411.34] Raise my heart for what prays yours
[1411.34 → 1418.52] Everything I am for your kingdom's cause
[1418.52 → 1425.52] As I walk from earth into eternity
[1425.52 → 1436.70] Hosanna, Hosanna
[1436.70 → 1441.70] Hosanna in the highest
[1441.70 → 1448.70] Hosanna, Hosanna
[1448.70 → 1454.08] Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest
[1454.08 → 1461.88] Hosanna in the highest
[1461.88 → 1469.44] Will you bow your heads and pray with me a prayer of confession?
[1469.44 → 1474.28] 2 Chronicles 7.14 says
[1474.28 → 1477.50] If my people who are called by my name
[1477.50 → 1480.46] Humble themselves and pray and seek my face
[1480.46 → 1482.56] And turn from their wicked ways
[1482.56 → 1484.44] Then I will hear from heaven
[1484.44 → 1485.76] And forgive their sin
[1485.76 → 1487.34] And heal their land
[1487.34 → 1490.36] Father, we confess we don't often
[1490.36 → 1492.86] Humble ourselves or seek your face
[1492.86 → 1494.94] We often feel so capable
[1494.94 → 1498.06] In our own strength and insulated from needing you
[1498.06 → 1499.54] In our everyday lives
[1499.54 → 1500.86] Forgive us
[1500.86 → 1503.82] Let the Holy Spirit that you have given us
[1503.82 → 1505.16] As a comforter, a helper
[1505.16 → 1507.38] And a guarantee of our salvation
[1507.38 → 1508.44] Empower us
[1508.44 → 1511.40] To assume a posture of humility and dependence
[1511.40 → 1512.20] Before you
[1512.20 → 1515.38] Thank you for your promise to hear from heaven
[1515.38 → 1517.20] To forgive and to heal
[1517.20 → 1520.34] We rest in these promises
[1520.34 → 1521.36] We love you
[1521.36 → 1522.72] We trust you
[1522.72 → 1525.48] Our good and gracious King
[1525.48 → 1526.36] Amen
[1526.36 → 1553.34] I approach the throne of glory
[1553.34 → 1559.62] Nothing in my hands I bring
[1559.62 → 1560.62] Nothing in my hands I bring
[1560.62 → 1561.62] Nothing in my hands I bring
[1561.62 → 1562.62] Nothing in my hands I bring
[1562.62 → 1565.62] But the promise of acceptance
[1565.62 → 1572.62] From a good and gracious King
[1572.62 → 1578.62] I will give to you my burden
[1578.62 → 1584.90] As you give to me your strength
[1584.90 → 1591.10] Come and fill me with your spirit
[1591.10 → 1597.90] As I sing to you this praise
[1597.90 → 1603.90] You deserve the greater glory
[1603.90 → 1604.90] Overcome with joy
[1604.90 → 1605.90] Overcome with joy
[1605.90 → 1606.90] Overcome with joy
[1606.90 → 1607.90] Overcome with joy
[1607.90 → 1608.90] Overcome with joy
[1608.90 → 1610.90] Overcome with joy
[1610.90 → 1611.90] I lift my voice
[1611.90 → 1616.90] To the King in need of nothing
[1616.90 → 1622.90] Empty hand that I rejoice
[1622.90 → 1628.90] You deserve the greater glory
[1628.90 → 1630.90] Overcome with joy
[1630.90 → 1631.90] Overcome with joy
[1631.90 → 1632.90] Overcome with joy
[1632.90 → 1634.18] Overcome with joy
[1634.18 → 1635.90] I sing
[1635.90 → 1637.64] By your love
[1637.64 → 1640.90] By your love I am accepted
[1640.90 → 1642.48] You're a good and gracious
[1642.48 → 1647.84] You're a good and gracious man
[1647.84 → 1660.86] Oh, what grace that you would see me
[1660.86 → 1667.02] As your child, as your friend
[1667.02 → 1672.00] Safe, secure in you forever
[1672.00 → 1679.44] I pour out my praise again
[1679.44 → 1685.10] You deserve the greater glory
[1685.10 → 1692.94] Overcome, I lift my voice
[1692.94 → 1697.08] And to the King in it all loving
[1697.08 → 1704.52] And to the hand that I rejoice
[1704.52 → 1709.96] You deserve the greater glory
[1709.96 → 1715.96] Overcome with joy, I say
[1715.96 → 1721.52] By your love I am accepted
[1721.52 → 1728.40] You're a good and gracious King
[1728.40 → 1731.78] Holy, holy Lord almighty
[1731.78 → 1739.22] Good and gracious
[1739.22 → 1746.66] Good and gracious
[1746.66 → 1760.10] Good and gracious
[1760.10 → 1767.54] Good and gracious
[1767.54 → 1769.98] Holy, holy Lord almighty
[1769.98 → 1774.98] Good and gracious
[1774.98 → 1778.42] You deserve the greater glory
[1778.42 → 1782.42] Holy, holy Lord almighty
[1782.42 → 1783.86] Lord almighty
[1783.86 → 1785.86] Good and gracious
[1785.86 → 1789.86] Good and gracious
[1789.86 → 1799.30] Good and gracious
[1799.30 → 1803.30] You deserve the greater glory
[1803.30 → 1806.74] You deserve the greater glory
[1806.74 → 1810.18] Overcome with joy
[1810.18 → 1811.18] I sing
[1811.18 → 1811.62] I sing
[1811.62 → 1813.06] I will love my voice
[1813.06 → 1814.06] My voice
[1814.06 → 1815.06] My voice
[1815.06 → 1819.06] To the King in it all loving
[1819.06 → 1820.50] You deserve the greater glory
[1820.50 → 1821.50] I sing
[1821.50 → 1822.50] Empty-hearted
[1822.50 → 1823.50] Empty-hearted
[1823.50 → 1825.50] I rejoice
[1825.50 → 1827.50] You deserve the greater glory
[1827.50 → 1831.50] You deserve the greater glory
[1831.50 → 1838.50] Overcome with joy, I sing
[1838.50 → 1839.50] By your love I sing
[1839.50 → 1840.50] By your love I sing
[1840.50 → 1843.36] By your love I am accepted
[1843.36 → 1850.34] You're a good and gracious King
[1850.34 → 1863.50] You're a good and gracious King
[1863.50 → 1867.78] Amen, you may be seated
[1867.78 → 1874.30] Well as Pastor Jonathan mentioned
[1874.30 → 1875.74] We have the privilege of welcoming
[1875.74 → 1876.64] A number of new members
[1876.64 → 1877.34] Into our church
[1877.34 → 1878.64] In the 9am service
[1878.64 → 1879.86] I think most of them were there
[1879.86 → 1881.12] I think we have a picture on the screen
[1881.12 → 1882.62] Of those who are in the 9am service
[1882.62 → 1885.14] But we have a number more new members
[1885.14 → 1886.80] To join this morning
[1886.80 → 1887.98] And I'd like to invite you up
[1887.98 → 1889.20] On the stage at this time
[1889.20 → 1890.04] So if you're joining Hope
[1890.04 → 1890.96] You and your families
[1890.96 → 1891.94] Come up on the stage
[1891.94 → 1893.44] And we want to introduce you
[1893.44 → 1894.24] To your church
[1894.24 → 1924.22] I just want to say that
[1924.22 → 1924.90] It's a privilege
[1924.90 → 1926.98] Every time we do new members classes
[1926.98 → 1928.54] To get to know you
[1928.54 → 1929.58] To hear your stories
[1929.58 → 1931.60] And to have you join our church family
[1931.60 → 1933.02] And I know a lot of us
[1933.02 → 1933.96] Don't like public speaking
[1933.96 → 1935.34] I was talking with someone
[1935.34 → 1936.22] Just before the service
[1936.22 → 1937.34] But I'd love for you
[1937.34 → 1938.28] Just to take a few minutes
[1938.28 → 1939.22] To say who you are
[1939.22 → 1940.66] A bit of your story
[1940.66 → 1942.08] And what made you want to join
[1942.08 → 1942.90] Our church's members
[1942.90 → 1946.10] Good morning
[1946.10 → 1948.68] My name is Rhoda McDonald
[1948.68 → 1951.66] I've been a Christian
[1951.66 → 1953.10] Since I was about 9
[1953.10 → 1956.94] I have two sons
[1956.94 → 1957.74] And two daughters
[1957.74 → 1960.32] And they are grandparents
[1960.32 → 1961.58] Wow
[1961.58 → 1963.42] We've been married 66 years
[1963.42 → 1964.26] Come July
[1964.26 → 1965.06] Praise the Lord
[1965.06 → 1971.94] I'm John McDonald
[1971.94 → 1976.16] I didn't come to Christ
[1976.16 → 1977.06] When I was 9
[1977.06 → 1979.30] I was 39
[1979.30 → 1983.00] My wife
[1983.00 → 1985.40] And three of our four children
[1985.40 → 1986.94] Came to know Jesus
[1986.94 → 1988.26] I did
[1988.26 → 1993.42] After our marriage broke up
[1993.42 → 1996.38] And hundreds of Christians
[1996.38 → 1998.58] In Victoria praying
[1998.58 → 1999.84] That John McDonald
[1999.84 → 2000.72] Would be saved
[2000.72 → 2003.10] God answered their prayer
[2003.10 → 2004.12] And I was
[2004.12 → 2005.34] Praise the Lord
[2005.34 → 2010.86] We live in the area
[2010.86 → 2013.28] Just down the Creekside town houses
[2013.28 → 2015.02] Just down the street
[2015.02 → 2016.38] From where the Herod's were
[2016.38 → 2017.92] We have been coming
[2017.92 → 2019.24] To Hope for a year
[2019.24 → 2020.72] And we're very happy
[2020.72 → 2021.84] To be here
[2021.84 → 2023.62] In this spirit filled church
[2023.62 → 2030.66] Good morning
[2030.66 → 2031.46] Hi everyone
[2031.46 → 2033.34] My name is Multi
[2033.34 → 2035.46] Friends call me Vim
[2035.46 → 2037.26] It's easier sometimes
[2037.26 → 2038.88] Because it's mouthful
[2038.88 → 2042.02] So I am a student
[2042.02 → 2044.30] At Trinity Western University
[2044.30 → 2045.34] New student
[2045.34 → 2046.72] I'm married
[2046.72 → 2048.28] And I have a daughter
[2048.28 → 2049.48] My wife and daughter
[2049.48 → 2052.08] Is currently back in Sri Lanka
[2052.08 → 2053.06] Where I come from
[2053.06 → 2057.22] So I have been
[2057.22 → 2058.70] Like raised in a very
[2058.70 → 2061.54] Devout Catholic family
[2061.54 → 2062.70] Back in Sri Lanka
[2062.70 → 2066.72] But for past 5, 10 years
[2066.72 → 2067.84] I have been like
[2067.84 → 2069.30] Away from faith
[2069.30 → 2070.42] From Jesus
[2070.42 → 2071.32] And all that
[2071.32 → 2073.26] But coming here
[2073.26 → 2073.88] One thing
[2073.88 → 2075.54] I realize is
[2075.54 → 2078.20] Like God's providence
[2078.20 → 2080.24] And you know
[2080.24 → 2081.68] How he takes care of
[2081.68 → 2083.44] Like me individually
[2083.44 → 2084.64] And how he loves me
[2084.64 → 2086.44] So this
[2086.44 → 2088.96] And another factor is
[2088.96 → 2090.92] That I am a sinner
[2090.92 → 2092.54] And this is
[2092.54 → 2094.14] This is a long story
[2094.14 → 2095.66] But in short
[2095.66 → 2096.84] I have experienced
[2096.84 → 2097.82] This profoundly
[2097.82 → 2099.84] Coming here
[2099.84 → 2102.28] And being in a different setting
[2102.28 → 2102.72] Different
[2102.72 → 2103.92] It's humbling
[2103.92 → 2107.00] And coming to this church
[2107.00 → 2109.44] It's actually
[2109.44 → 2111.66] This was
[2111.66 → 2113.04] I met
[2113.04 → 2114.52] Our chaplain
[2114.52 → 2116.20] Dr. Ed Gerber
[2116.20 → 2118.06] So he was very kind
[2118.06 → 2119.30] And although he's like
[2119.30 → 2120.70] A director in our university
[2120.70 → 2122.20] He was very friendly
[2122.20 → 2123.36] And open with me
[2123.36 → 2124.20] From the beginning
[2124.20 → 2124.88] He has
[2124.88 → 2127.04] Like prayed for me
[2127.04 → 2128.16] And helped me
[2128.16 → 2129.28] In a lot of tight spots
[2129.28 → 2130.98] And so yeah
[2130.98 → 2132.36] And I
[2132.36 → 2134.20] Like asked
[2134.20 → 2135.16] What's his church
[2135.16 → 2136.30] And one day
[2136.30 → 2137.18] Pastor Dave
[2137.18 → 2138.10] Came to our chapel
[2138.10 → 2141.26] And hearing the word
[2141.26 → 2144.06] I decided to come here
[2144.06 → 2147.30] Because it opened my heart
[2147.30 → 2150.78] In a way I have never experienced
[2150.78 → 2152.84] So that's my story in short
[2152.84 → 2154.44] So welcome
[2154.44 → 2160.96] Good morning Hope family
[2160.96 → 2162.72] I can call most of you family
[2162.72 → 2163.82] At this point
[2163.82 → 2166.60] My family arrived here
[2166.60 → 2169.34] In October 2022
[2169.34 → 2172.34] And prior to that
[2172.34 → 2174.08] We had visited Canada
[2174.08 → 2175.76] Occasionally
[2175.76 → 2176.54] From South Africa
[2176.54 → 2177.20] Our homeland
[2177.20 → 2180.16] And during those visits
[2180.16 → 2181.48] We had visited Hope
[2181.48 → 2183.32] So before we came here
[2183.32 → 2184.24] We already knew
[2184.24 → 2185.94] That we would want to be here
[2185.94 → 2187.88] We've been here for a while
[2187.88 → 2189.10] Missed the first membership
[2189.10 → 2190.14] Sadly so
[2190.14 → 2193.18] But very happy to become
[2193.18 → 2194.08] Members of Hope
[2194.08 → 2195.84] I am
[2195.84 → 2198.36] I am currently also
[2198.36 → 2199.34] Serving in Hope
[2199.34 → 2201.02] As leader of hospitality
[2201.02 → 2203.22] So all your services
[2203.22 → 2204.36] Hands up for volunteers
[2204.36 → 2207.36] Put it out there
[2207.36 → 2208.84] As well as
[2208.84 → 2209.90] Children's Church
[2209.90 → 2211.20] So yes
[2211.20 → 2212.18] Very happy to be here
[2212.18 → 2212.64] Thank you
[2212.64 → 2213.52] For the opportunity
[2213.52 → 2222.10] I'll be honest
[2222.10 → 2222.94] I wish that
[2222.94 → 2224.40] Boris could be up here
[2224.40 → 2225.60] And I could just pass it to him
[2225.60 → 2226.42] And say you speak
[2226.42 → 2228.36] But that's not the case
[2228.36 → 2230.66] So my name is Melanie Damaged
[2230.66 → 2232.28] I've been at Hope
[2232.28 → 2233.70] For about two and a half years now
[2233.70 → 2236.42] I started coming to Hope
[2236.42 → 2239.02] When Boris and I were dating
[2239.02 → 2240.12] And we decided to make this
[2240.12 → 2240.82] Our home church
[2240.82 → 2242.40] As we went forward
[2242.40 → 2244.92] So a little bit about me
[2244.92 → 2247.24] I grew up in a very conservative church
[2247.24 → 2248.10] Called a Gospel Hall
[2248.10 → 2249.44] If you know what that is
[2249.44 → 2250.32] You know what it is
[2250.32 → 2251.40] And if you don't
[2251.40 → 2252.84] Think of Amish
[2252.84 → 2254.04] Plus one
[2254.04 → 2256.88] It just gives you a bit of a context
[2256.88 → 2258.32] In terms of the level of
[2258.32 → 2260.98] Yeah the level of conservative group
[2260.98 → 2265.18] So growing up in that church
[2265.18 → 2267.28] Theology was a bit different
[2267.28 → 2268.78] So joining the church
[2268.78 → 2271.28] Meant you had to meet with the elders
[2271.28 → 2272.36] After you were baptized
[2272.36 → 2275.30] And then asked to participate in communion
[2275.30 → 2277.86] Because communion was a closed practice
[2277.86 → 2280.32] So I did that when I was 13
[2280.32 → 2284.38] And in the Gospel Halls
[2284.38 → 2285.70] Membership at other churches
[2285.70 → 2288.78] Was sort of viewed more like a status symbol
[2288.78 → 2290.60] A very religious thing
[2290.60 → 2292.40] So kind of like a country club membership
[2292.40 → 2295.14] Where it didn't really speak of an authentic
[2295.14 → 2296.72] Commitment to the church
[2296.72 → 2297.72] And your faith
[2297.72 → 2298.66] But rather like
[2298.66 → 2299.34] I don't know
[2299.34 → 2301.30] Joining a political party or something
[2301.30 → 2303.26] It just looked good from an appearance perspective
[2303.26 → 2306.58] So when I left the Gospel Halls
[2306.58 → 2307.96] I avoided church membership
[2307.96 → 2311.82] Because I didn't want my church
[2311.82 → 2313.80] My commitment to a church
[2313.80 → 2315.00] To be just for looks
[2315.00 → 2317.84] And I knew that I was committed to serve
[2317.84 → 2318.34] In my heart
[2318.34 → 2319.30] And in my actions
[2319.30 → 2322.80] I was convicted of that
[2322.80 → 2323.44] In the last
[2323.44 → 2324.06] I don't know
[2324.06 → 2324.88] Eight years or so
[2324.88 → 2325.94] I was at a church
[2325.94 → 2326.98] I was serving in leadership
[2326.98 → 2329.12] In a couple different ways
[2329.12 → 2331.34] And I had some people
[2331.34 → 2332.20] Gently come alongside
[2332.20 → 2332.62] And say
[2332.62 → 2333.08] Hold on
[2333.08 → 2334.50] Let's unpack this a little bit
[2334.50 → 2335.46] Like we think it's actually
[2335.46 → 2336.10] Really important
[2336.10 → 2337.66] So I met with
[2337.66 → 2340.44] An older, wiser gentleman
[2340.44 → 2341.36] My friend's grandpa
[2341.36 → 2342.70] Who understood
[2342.70 → 2344.28] The church context
[2344.28 → 2345.20] That I grew up in
[2345.20 → 2347.10] And we unpacked membership
[2347.10 → 2347.70] A little bit
[2347.70 → 2348.72] And some of my assumptions
[2348.72 → 2350.46] And he helped explain
[2350.46 → 2353.12] The value of church membership
[2353.12 → 2354.68] And changing
[2354.68 → 2356.00] Sort of what it looked like for me
[2356.00 → 2358.74] So I wrestled with it a bit
[2358.74 → 2359.68] After our conversation
[2359.68 → 2361.70] But then decided
[2361.70 → 2363.66] To commit
[2363.66 → 2364.52] And felt called to
[2364.52 → 2365.34] In a more formal way
[2365.34 → 2367.88] So I did back than
[2367.88 → 2369.00] And similarly now
[2369.00 → 2369.50] I've been at Hope
[2369.50 → 2370.32] For two and a half years
[2370.32 → 2371.12] Serving in leadership
[2371.12 → 2373.60] And decided that it was time
[2373.60 → 2374.58] To do
[2374.58 → 2376.58] Demonstrate the commitment
[2376.58 → 2377.52] A little bit more formally
[2377.52 → 2378.18] As a member here
[2378.18 → 2379.26] Yeah
[2379.26 → 2387.14] All the people
[2387.14 → 2388.16] Who are on the stage today
[2388.16 → 2388.90] They were part of
[2388.90 → 2389.76] Our new members class
[2389.76 → 2390.56] We did about a month
[2390.56 → 2391.22] And a half ago
[2391.22 → 2393.24] And we talked a lot about
[2393.24 → 2394.50] The story of the Bible
[2394.50 → 2396.30] The trustworthiness of the Bible
[2396.30 → 2397.36] How to live faithfully
[2397.36 → 2397.90] As Christians
[2397.90 → 2398.96] In Western society
[2398.96 → 2400.28] And how to serve
[2400.28 → 2400.86] With all the gifts
[2400.86 → 2401.80] That God has given you
[2401.80 → 2403.08] And one of the
[2403.08 → 2404.66] Emphasis that we made
[2404.66 → 2405.70] Hopefully you remember this
[2405.70 → 2406.34] Is that membership
[2406.34 → 2407.02] Is a big deal
[2407.02 → 2407.58] And I appreciate
[2407.58 → 2408.44] What you both said
[2408.44 → 2409.16] About membership
[2409.16 → 2410.84] It's making commitment
[2410.84 → 2413.04] It's making a sense of
[2413.04 → 2413.82] It's sinking roots
[2413.82 → 2414.60] Into a community
[2414.60 → 2416.30] And I'll just say
[2416.30 → 2416.90] Some of the things
[2416.90 → 2417.50] That we emphasized
[2417.50 → 2418.32] Week after week
[2418.32 → 2419.18] Was that you're committing
[2419.18 → 2420.24] To a local body
[2420.24 → 2420.76] Of believers
[2420.76 → 2422.82] You are sitting
[2422.82 → 2423.44] And trusting
[2423.44 → 2424.22] And submitting
[2424.22 → 2425.04] To the teaching
[2425.04 → 2425.66] Of the scriptures
[2425.66 → 2426.68] In that community
[2426.68 → 2428.08] You're committing
[2428.08 → 2429.22] To being discipled
[2429.22 → 2430.16] By this community
[2430.16 → 2430.70] Of believers
[2430.70 → 2432.06] You're committed
[2432.06 → 2432.92] To using your gifts
[2432.92 → 2433.52] Your time
[2433.52 → 2434.64] Your talent
[2434.64 → 2435.30] Your resources
[2435.30 → 2436.64] To serve
[2436.64 → 2438.26] And you're committing
[2438.26 → 2439.10] To bearing witness
[2439.10 → 2439.60] To Jesus
[2439.60 → 2440.90] In our community
[2440.90 → 2441.80] With our church
[2441.80 → 2443.46] That's what membership
[2443.46 → 2444.08] Is all about
[2444.08 → 2445.26] And, so I've got
[2445.26 → 2445.88] Four questions
[2445.88 → 2446.72] For all of you
[2446.72 → 2447.38] And you know what
[2447.38 → 2447.68] I'm going to do
[2447.68 → 2448.08] This Sunday
[2448.08 → 2449.36] I'll ask you to say
[2449.36 → 2450.58] We do God helping us
[2450.58 → 2451.32] All at once
[2451.32 → 2451.84] In the past
[2451.84 → 2452.54] We passed the mic
[2452.54 → 2453.24] But I trust that
[2453.24 → 2453.68] You could say it
[2453.68 → 2454.14] All together
[2454.14 → 2455.24] And so here are
[2455.24 → 2455.84] The four questions
[2455.84 → 2456.70] I have for each of you
[2456.70 → 2457.36] As you join
[2457.36 → 2458.54] This body of believers
[2458.54 → 2459.44] Number one
[2459.44 → 2461.20] Do you love
[2461.20 → 2462.08] Jesus Christ
[2462.08 → 2463.96] Do you want to make
[2463.96 → 2464.72] Following him
[2464.72 → 2465.66] The goal of the rest
[2465.66 → 2466.32] Of your life
[2466.32 → 2468.14] Do you trust him
[2468.14 → 2468.78] As the one
[2468.78 → 2469.38] Who saves you
[2469.38 → 2469.92] From sin
[2469.92 → 2471.40] And with repentance
[2471.40 → 2472.64] And with joy
[2472.64 → 2473.76] Embrace him
[2473.76 → 2474.18] As the Lord
[2474.18 → 2474.84] Of your life
[2474.84 → 2476.34] Second
[2476.34 → 2477.88] Do you believe
[2477.88 → 2478.88] The Bible is
[2478.88 → 2480.10] The word of God
[2480.10 → 2481.56] Is trustworthy
[2481.56 → 2482.54] And true
[2482.54 → 2484.02] Revealing Christ
[2484.02 → 2484.76] And his purposes
[2484.76 → 2486.04] For us and the world
[2486.04 → 2487.64] Third
[2487.64 → 2488.74] Do you promise
[2488.74 → 2489.98] To do all that you can
[2489.98 → 2491.32] With the help
[2491.32 → 2492.18] Of the Holy Spirit
[2492.18 → 2493.54] To strengthen your love
[2493.54 → 2494.46] And commitment to Christ
[2494.46 → 2495.80] By sharing faithfully
[2495.80 → 2497.36] In the life of our church
[2497.36 → 2498.68] Honouring and submitting
[2498.68 → 2499.42] To his authority
[2499.42 → 2501.30] Fourth and finally
[2501.30 → 2502.60] Will you commit to growing
[2502.60 → 2504.68] Will you devote yourselves
[2504.68 → 2505.46] To the disciplines
[2505.46 → 2506.78] That foster your life
[2506.78 → 2507.30] In Christ
[2507.30 → 2508.68] And seek to use
[2508.68 → 2509.56] All the gifts
[2509.56 → 2510.52] That God has given you
[2510.52 → 2512.26] To serve his kingdom purposes
[2512.26 → 2514.42] What is your answer?
[2517.26 → 2517.78] Amen
[2517.78 → 2520.62] Well before we officially
[2520.62 → 2521.12] Welcome them
[2521.12 → 2522.14] I have a question for us
[2522.14 → 2523.04] As the local body
[2523.04 → 2523.40] Of believers
[2523.40 → 2524.16] Would you stand?
[2524.60 → 2525.28] Because it takes
[2525.28 → 2525.86] A whole community
[2525.86 → 2527.10] To grow and serve
[2527.10 → 2529.84] Brothers and sisters
[2529.84 → 2531.00] Of Hope Community Church
[2531.00 → 2531.96] Do you welcome
[2531.96 → 2532.98] These people
[2532.98 → 2533.62] Into the membership
[2533.62 → 2534.46] Of our church?
[2535.16 → 2536.08] Will you pray for them?
[2536.96 → 2537.52] Serve them?
[2537.88 → 2539.00] And love them
[2539.00 → 2540.24] As God gives you opportunity
[2540.24 → 2541.04] People of hope
[2541.04 → 2541.86] What is your answer?
[2542.64 → 2543.20] We do
[2543.20 → 2544.46] God helping us
[2544.46 → 2544.94] Amen
[2544.94 → 2546.32] Well let us
[2546.32 → 2546.86] Take a moment
[2546.86 → 2547.44] And welcome
[2547.44 → 2548.16] These new members
[2548.16 → 2549.02] Into our family
[2549.02 → 2559.80] I invite you
[2559.80 → 2560.60] To take your seats
[2560.60 → 2567.26] I'm going to pray
[2567.26 → 2567.84] A prayer
[2567.84 → 2568.88] Over you
[2568.88 → 2570.02] As soon as I can find it
[2570.02 → 2572.00] I think one of my
[2572.00 → 2572.82] Children moved
[2572.82 → 2574.22] My bookmark
[2574.22 → 2576.58] It's
[2576.58 → 2577.58] We're going to find this
[2577.58 → 2579.88] Or I'm just going to
[2579.88 → 2580.60] Freestyle it
[2580.60 → 2586.48] It's worth it
[2586.48 → 2587.14] It's worth the wait
[2587.14 → 2587.44] Everyone
[2587.44 → 2590.34] Or is it
[2590.34 → 2591.20] You're wondering
[2591.20 → 2593.40] I can't find it
[2593.40 → 2593.88] So I'm going to
[2593.88 → 2594.58] Freestyle it
[2594.58 → 2596.82] Would you extend
[2596.82 → 2597.36] Your hand
[2597.36 → 2598.14] To these members
[2598.14 → 2598.80] And we will pray
[2598.80 → 2599.52] A blessing over them
[2599.52 → 2600.76] Father we thank you
[2600.76 → 2602.20] That you have brought
[2602.20 → 2602.90] Each one
[2602.90 → 2603.30] Of these people
[2603.30 → 2604.16] Into our church family
[2604.16 → 2604.88] We praise you
[2604.88 → 2605.70] For them being here
[2605.70 → 2606.88] We praise you
[2606.88 → 2607.94] For your faithfulness
[2607.94 → 2608.76] In their lives
[2608.76 → 2609.78] For bringing them
[2609.78 → 2610.72] To a place of repentance
[2610.72 → 2611.28] And faith
[2611.28 → 2612.00] And giving them
[2612.00 → 2612.84] The desire to say
[2612.84 → 2614.18] Yes I want to be part
[2614.18 → 2615.06] Of the body of Christ
[2615.06 → 2616.34] I want to live
[2616.34 → 2617.60] And grow and serve
[2617.60 → 2618.44] In your family
[2618.44 → 2620.28] I pray that you'd use
[2620.28 → 2621.40] The many gifts they have
[2621.40 → 2622.88] To build up your church
[2622.88 → 2623.88] And to serve your city
[2623.88 → 2625.34] I pray that you would
[2625.34 → 2625.92] Deepen them
[2625.92 → 2627.14] In their love for you
[2627.14 → 2628.72] Their love for your word
[2628.72 → 2629.92] And their love
[2629.92 → 2630.66] For your church
[2630.66 → 2632.38] Would you make
[2632.38 → 2633.24] Jesus known
[2633.24 → 2633.84] Through them
[2633.84 → 2634.58] And through us
[2634.58 → 2635.26] In this city
[2635.26 → 2636.82] And build us up
[2636.82 → 2637.96] As a faithful witness
[2637.96 → 2638.80] To Jesus Christ
[2638.80 → 2640.04] We pray in Jesus name
[2640.04 → 2640.76] Amen
[2640.76 → 2643.18] I'm going to invite
[2643.18 → 2644.36] Everyone except for
[2644.36 → 2645.90] Ezra's family
[2645.90 → 2646.80] To find their seats
[2646.80 → 2647.38] Because we're going
[2647.38 → 2648.42] To baptize Ezra
[2648.42 → 2651.00] Oh yeah you can
[2651.00 → 2651.38] Find us
[2651.38 → 2654.58] So yes
[2654.58 → 2659.90] So just to be clear
[2659.90 → 2661.04] Ezra has grown up
[2661.04 → 2661.92] In a family that loves
[2661.92 → 2662.20] Jesus
[2662.20 → 2662.94] He has grown up
[2662.94 → 2663.48] In the church
[2663.48 → 2664.14] And in the course
[2664.14 → 2665.10] Of the membership class
[2665.10 → 2666.48] Marco just said to me
[2666.48 → 2668.24] We haven't baptized Ezra yet
[2668.24 → 2669.20] And we'd love to do that
[2669.20 → 2669.90] And I said well it'd be
[2669.90 → 2670.88] A privilege to do so
[2670.88 → 2672.52] This week Ezra and I
[2672.52 → 2673.10] Met together
[2673.10 → 2674.62] And we talked about
[2674.62 → 2675.04] Baptism
[2675.04 → 2675.70] What it means
[2675.70 → 2677.94] What you believe in Jesus
[2677.94 → 2679.04] And I just want to say
[2679.04 → 2679.72] It was a privilege
[2679.72 → 2680.72] To hear you speak
[2680.72 → 2681.56] Words of faith
[2681.56 → 2683.16] Ezra shared a number
[2683.16 → 2683.46] Of things
[2683.46 → 2683.88] I'm not going to
[2683.88 → 2684.66] Rehash all of it
[2684.66 → 2685.24] But one of the things
[2685.24 → 2686.26] That I was surprised by
[2686.26 → 2687.86] And encouraged by
[2687.86 → 2689.28] Is that you recognize
[2689.28 → 2690.20] Ezra that it is not
[2690.20 → 2691.48] Always easy to follow Jesus
[2691.48 → 2693.24] In a public school
[2693.24 → 2694.90] In sports
[2694.90 → 2695.94] In friendship
[2695.94 → 2696.88] You have a sense
[2696.88 → 2697.82] Of the difficulty
[2697.82 → 2698.68] That comes with
[2698.68 → 2699.18] Saying I'm going to
[2699.18 → 2700.10] I want to follow Jesus
[2700.10 → 2702.34] In public life
[2702.34 → 2703.38] And I want to honour you
[2703.38 → 2703.92] For the depth
[2703.92 → 2704.58] Of your conviction
[2704.58 → 2706.50] And for your desire
[2706.50 → 2707.48] To say I want to be
[2707.48 → 2708.64] Baptized and follow Jesus
[2708.64 → 2709.36] In this church
[2709.36 → 2709.90] So Ezra
[2709.90 → 2711.00] We know you love
[2711.00 → 2711.68] And follow Jesus
[2711.68 → 2713.14] And we are looking forward
[2713.14 → 2714.22] To welcome you officially
[2714.22 → 2715.16] Into our church family
[2715.16 → 2715.92] Through baptism
[2715.92 → 2717.74] There are two things
[2717.74 → 2718.36] I want to do
[2718.36 → 2719.30] We do this at all
[2719.30 → 2720.02] Of our baptisms
[2720.02 → 2722.02] I read my favourite verse
[2722.02 → 2722.66] About baptism
[2722.66 → 2723.74] That comes from Romans 6
[2723.74 → 2724.66] And then we're going to
[2724.66 → 2725.62] Recite a creed
[2725.62 → 2726.50] And I'll tell you
[2726.50 → 2727.02] Why we're doing that
[2727.02 → 2727.50] In just a minute
[2727.50 → 2728.20] But let me just read
[2728.20 → 2728.70] For us words
[2728.70 → 2729.56] From Romans 6
[2729.56 → 2730.78] To ground us
[2730.78 → 2731.36] And remind us
[2731.36 → 2733.14] What this baptism means
[2733.14 → 2735.92] We the church
[2735.92 → 2737.84] Were buried with Jesus
[2737.84 → 2738.64] Through baptism
[2738.64 → 2739.34] And death
[2739.34 → 2740.46] In order that
[2740.46 → 2741.20] Just as Christ
[2741.20 → 2742.00] Was raised
[2742.00 → 2743.14] From the dead
[2743.14 → 2744.44] To the glory
[2744.44 → 2744.96] Of the Father
[2744.96 → 2745.64] We too
[2745.64 → 2747.56] May live a new life
[2747.56 → 2749.16] For if we have been
[2749.16 → 2749.56] United
[2749.56 → 2750.60] With him
[2750.60 → 2751.50] In a death like his
[2751.50 → 2752.30] We will certainly
[2752.30 → 2753.54] Be united with him
[2753.54 → 2754.28] In a resurrection
[2754.28 → 2755.10] Like his
[2755.10 → 2756.18] For we know
[2756.18 → 2757.02] That our old self
[2757.02 → 2758.42] Was crucified with Christ
[2758.42 → 2760.42] And the body of sin
[2760.42 → 2761.52] Might be done away with
[2761.52 → 2763.04] We will no longer
[2763.04 → 2764.36] Be slaves to sin
[2764.36 → 2765.46] Because anyone
[2765.46 → 2766.64] Who has died with him
[2766.64 → 2768.36] Has been set free
[2768.36 → 2768.98] From sin
[2768.98 → 2769.84] And Ezra
[2769.84 → 2770.66] This baptism
[2770.66 → 2771.68] The symbolism
[2771.68 → 2772.48] Of what's happening
[2772.48 → 2773.00] Is you are being
[2773.00 → 2773.94] Buried with Christ
[2773.94 → 2774.60] Through the waters
[2774.60 → 2775.12] Of baptism
[2775.12 → 2776.40] And you are raised
[2776.40 → 2777.00] To new life
[2777.00 → 2777.78] With us
[2777.78 → 2778.82] In the resurrection
[2778.82 → 2779.76] Of Jesus Christ
[2779.76 → 2781.12] It is a privilege
[2781.12 → 2782.60] To have you join our church
[2782.60 → 2783.60] Through baptism
[2783.60 → 2786.22] We're going to recite
[2786.22 → 2786.72] What is called
[2786.72 → 2787.56] The Apostles Creed
[2787.56 → 2788.80] If you're new to our church
[2788.80 → 2789.62] I want you to know
[2789.62 → 2790.54] That this creed
[2790.54 → 2791.94] Is one of the
[2791.94 → 2792.82] If not only
[2792.82 → 2793.90] The only document
[2793.90 → 2795.00] That unites the body
[2795.00 → 2795.36] Of Christ
[2795.36 → 2795.98] Throughout history
[2795.98 → 2797.36] And throughout the world
[2797.36 → 2798.72] And from what we know
[2798.72 → 2799.74] Of the Apostles Creed
[2799.74 → 2801.36] It was used to train
[2801.36 → 2802.50] People for baptism
[2802.50 → 2803.86] When new believers
[2803.86 → 2804.78] Came into the church
[2804.78 → 2805.92] The leaders of the church
[2805.92 → 2806.28] Would say
[2806.28 → 2807.20] This is what we believe
[2807.20 → 2807.78] About God
[2807.78 → 2808.72] This is what we believe
[2808.72 → 2809.28] About Jesus
[2809.28 → 2810.30] This is what we believe
[2810.30 → 2811.64] About being part of the church
[2811.64 → 2812.08] And so
[2812.08 → 2813.52] We are about to recite
[2813.52 → 2816.02] A statement of faith
[2816.02 → 2817.48] That unites the body
[2817.48 → 2818.40] Of Christ historically
[2818.40 → 2819.12] And throughout the world
[2819.12 → 2819.46] And so
[2819.46 → 2820.28] I actually invite you
[2820.28 → 2820.82] To stand
[2820.82 → 2822.02] Plant your feet
[2822.02 → 2822.80] In this conviction
[2822.80 → 2824.08] Let's recite it
[2824.08 → 2824.62] With conviction
[2824.62 → 2826.12] And then let's celebrate baptism
[2826.12 → 2827.50] So let's say together
[2827.50 → 2829.12] I believe in God
[2829.12 → 2830.60] The Father Almighty
[2830.60 → 2833.04] Creator of heaven and earth
[2833.04 → 2835.56] I believe in Jesus Christ
[2835.56 → 2837.00] His only Son
[2837.00 → 2838.00] Our Lord
[2838.00 → 2839.42] Who was conceived
[2839.42 → 2840.80] By the Holy Spirit
[2840.80 → 2842.96] Born of the Virgin Mary
[2842.96 → 2844.36] He suffered
[2844.36 → 2845.78] In Pontius Pilate
[2845.78 → 2847.00] Was crucified
[2847.00 → 2848.80] Died and was buried
[2848.80 → 2850.88] He ascended to God
[2850.88 → 2852.28] For the third day
[2852.28 → 2853.32] He rose again
[2853.32 → 2854.14] From the dead
[2854.14 → 2856.08] He ascended to heaven
[2856.08 → 2857.06] And is seated
[2857.06 → 2858.14] At the right hand
[2858.14 → 2858.62] Of God
[2858.62 → 2859.78] The Father Almighty
[2859.78 → 2861.20] From there
[2861.20 → 2861.96] He will come
[2861.96 → 2863.10] To judge the living
[2863.10 → 2863.92] And the dead
[2863.92 → 2865.38] I believe
[2865.38 → 2866.40] In the Holy Spirit
[2866.40 → 2868.66] The Holy Catholic Church
[2868.66 → 2870.60] The communion of sins
[2870.60 → 2872.58] The forgiveness of sins
[2872.58 → 2874.66] The resurrection of the body
[2874.66 → 2876.62] And the life everlasting
[2876.62 → 2877.74] Amen
[2877.74 → 2879.28] You may find your seats
[2879.28 → 2881.16] Alright Ezra
[2881.16 → 2898.40] Right on the other side
[2898.40 → 2900.14] Actually no
[2900.14 → 2900.78] You can be right there
[2900.78 → 2901.24] That's perfect
[2901.24 → 2908.58] Ezra
[2908.58 → 2909.38] Dichasia
[2909.38 → 2911.06] I baptize you
[2911.06 → 2911.98] In the name of the Father
[2911.98 → 2913.38] The Son
[2913.38 → 2915.04] And the Holy Spirit
[2915.04 → 2929.84] Let's go right into the middle
[2929.84 → 2943.78] Let's go right into the middle
[2943.78 → 2947.20] We're going to keep you
[2947.20 → 2947.94] On the stage for a minute
[2947.94 → 2948.30] Marco
[2948.30 → 2950.24] We'll stay on the stage
[2950.24 → 2951.24] I know
[2951.24 → 2952.52] We don't like being on the stage
[2952.52 → 2954.04] We have a gift for you
[2954.04 → 2955.04] From one of your youth leaders
[2955.04 → 2956.38] And then we want to pray for you
[2956.38 → 2960.30] Hi I'm Jacob
[2960.30 → 2963.68] Hello I'm Jacob
[2963.68 → 2965.38] I'm one of his youth leaders
[2965.38 → 2968.20] And on behalf of our other leaders
[2968.20 → 2970.20] And all your friends at youth
[2970.20 → 2971.54] We give you this Bible
[2971.54 → 2973.18] There's a note inside
[2973.18 → 2975.16] And yeah we're praying for you
[2975.16 → 2976.24] It's such a joy to see
[2976.24 → 2977.88] You're growing in your faith
[2977.88 → 2978.74] The last couple of years
[2978.74 → 2979.48] That we've known you
[2979.48 → 2980.36] And it's yeah
[2980.36 → 2981.40] Just a blessing to have you
[2981.40 → 2982.16] Amongst us
[2982.16 → 2983.02] Praise God
[2983.02 → 2991.98] I'd like to pray a prayer
[2991.98 → 2993.00] Of blessing over you too
[2993.00 → 2993.88] Let's pray
[2993.88 → 2995.62] Father we thank you
[2995.62 → 2996.60] For bringing new people
[2996.60 → 2997.58] Into our church family
[2997.58 → 2999.38] And we praise you
[2999.38 → 3000.10] For our children
[3000.10 → 3002.70] We think of the responsibilities
[3002.70 → 3003.92] As parents to raise them
[3003.92 → 3004.46] In the faith
[3004.46 → 3005.40] And as a church
[3005.40 → 3006.88] And we ask that you
[3006.88 → 3007.56] Give us wisdom
[3007.56 → 3008.36] And discernment
[3008.36 → 3009.52] To teach
[3009.52 → 3010.74] And model the gospel
[3010.74 → 3012.42] And we pray Lord
[3012.42 → 3013.72] That Ezra would take hold
[3013.72 → 3014.50] Of you by faith
[3014.50 → 3015.32] Every year
[3015.32 → 3016.42] For the rest of his life
[3016.42 → 3018.00] And make bold witness
[3018.00 → 3018.66] In his words
[3018.66 → 3019.34] And his deeds
[3019.34 → 3020.92] To Jesus Christ
[3020.92 → 3022.48] Would you fill him
[3022.48 → 3023.16] With your spirit
[3023.16 → 3024.34] And use him
[3024.34 → 3024.88] For your kingdom
[3024.88 → 3025.56] We pray this
[3025.56 → 3026.42] In Jesus name
[3026.42 → 3027.12] Amen
[3027.12 → 3028.38] Welcome
[3028.38 → 3029.70] It's great to have you
[3029.70 → 3030.28] In our church
[3030.28 → 3039.10] At this time
[3039.10 → 3039.62] I'm going to invite
[3039.62 → 3040.10] Our children
[3040.10 → 3040.92] Age 3
[3040.92 → 3041.68] To grade 3
[3041.68 → 3042.82] Upstairs to Cornerstone
[3042.82 → 3043.30] If you're new
[3043.30 → 3044.26] Just follow the children
[3044.26 → 3045.90] And also we have launch

[3046.74 → 3047.84] Who are grade 4 to 7

[3048.62 → 3049.22] You can follow
[3049.22 → 3049.92] Peter and Misha
[3049.92 → 3053.16] And then we'll have prayer
[3053.16 → 3063.04] It is so wonderful
[3063.04 → 3063.60] To be here
[3063.60 → 3064.30] And celebrate
[3064.30 → 3066.12] Such defining moments
[3066.12 → 3068.52] As joining a membership
[3068.52 → 3069.28] Of a community
[3069.28 → 3071.38] And joining the fellowship
[3071.38 → 3072.04] In Christ
[3072.04 → 3072.84] Through baptism
[3072.84 → 3076.44] And I'm mindful
[3076.44 → 3077.88] That often
[3077.88 → 3079.44] It's easy to forget
[3079.44 → 3081.92] How awesome it is
[3081.92 → 3083.62] That we live in such freedom
[3083.62 → 3084.46] To be able to
[3084.46 → 3085.36] To witness
[3085.36 → 3086.06] To our community
[3086.06 → 3087.14] And to be in our community
[3087.14 → 3088.28] When there are places
[3088.28 → 3088.86] In the world
[3088.86 → 3089.44] Where people
[3089.44 → 3092.16] Have to live out
[3092.16 → 3092.74] Their faith
[3092.74 → 3093.48] In private
[3093.48 → 3095.88] For fear of persecution
[3095.88 → 3098.40] So in the spirit
[3098.40 → 3098.96] Of community
[3098.96 → 3100.46] Please bow your heads
[3100.46 → 3100.86] With me
[3100.86 → 3101.64] As we pray
[3101.64 → 3102.86] For our community here
[3102.86 → 3109.92] Heavenly Father
[3109.92 → 3112.66] We gather before you
[3112.66 → 3114.94] A diverse community
[3114.94 → 3116.90] Unified by the truth
[3116.90 → 3118.32] Of your love
[3118.32 → 3121.34] You love us unconditionally
[3121.34 → 3123.28] And you sent your son
[3123.28 → 3124.16] Jesus Christ
[3124.16 → 3125.58] To dwell amongst us
[3125.58 → 3127.16] And to redeem us
[3127.16 → 3127.98] From sin
[3127.98 → 3130.78] And in Jesus name
[3130.78 → 3132.90] We invite your Holy Spirit
[3132.90 → 3135.08] To fill this place
[3135.08 → 3136.28] And our homes
[3136.28 → 3140.22] You are a powerful God
[3140.22 → 3141.34] Created the heavens
[3141.34 → 3142.16] And the earth
[3142.16 → 3144.04] From the mountains
[3144.04 → 3145.00] To the seas
[3145.00 → 3146.56] You have prepared
[3146.56 → 3148.20] A wonderful world
[3148.20 → 3148.78] For us
[3148.78 → 3150.10] To experience
[3150.10 → 3151.46] As evidence
[3151.46 → 3152.38] Of your power
[3152.38 → 3155.04] You are our one
[3155.04 → 3156.60] Sovereign Lord
[3156.60 → 3159.36] And as we venture our
[3159.36 → 3160.14] Into creation
[3160.14 → 3160.82] This summer
[3160.82 → 3162.60] We give thanks
[3162.60 → 3163.26] For the beauty
[3163.26 → 3163.76] And wonder
[3163.76 → 3164.60] That you've prepared
[3164.60 → 3165.20] For us
[3165.20 → 3168.66] Lord as a community
[3168.66 → 3170.10] We lift those here
[3170.10 → 3171.14] Who are facing
[3171.14 → 3172.28] Difficult decisions
[3172.28 → 3174.66] We pray for clarity
[3174.66 → 3175.32] Of thought
[3175.32 → 3176.52] In each circumstance
[3176.52 → 3177.68] In our lives
[3177.68 → 3180.44] We pray for healing
[3180.44 → 3181.82] For those who are
[3181.82 → 3182.88] Struggling with health
[3182.88 → 3183.56] Challenges
[3183.56 → 3185.68] And for those
[3185.68 → 3186.64] In situations
[3186.64 → 3187.54] Of conflict
[3187.54 → 3189.64] We pray for peace
[3189.64 → 3190.22] Dear Lord
[3190.22 → 3193.08] We pray Lord
[3193.08 → 3193.56] For those
[3193.56 → 3194.18] Amongst us
[3194.18 → 3194.80] Who are visiting
[3194.80 → 3195.38] Your church
[3195.38 → 3196.38] For the first time
[3196.38 → 3198.06] May they sense
[3198.06 → 3198.86] Your presence
[3198.86 → 3199.96] And witness
[3199.96 → 3201.02] Your love for them
[3201.02 → 3202.42] Through the hospitality
[3202.42 → 3203.68] In this congregation
[3203.68 → 3207.46] We pray for your Holy Spirit
[3207.46 → 3208.62] To bring unity
[3208.62 → 3210.34] Amongst all our church members
[3210.34 → 3211.88] We ask
[3211.88 → 3213.08] For the appreciation
[3213.08 → 3214.06] Of differences
[3214.06 → 3215.88] And for mutual support
[3215.88 → 3217.80] May your love
[3217.80 → 3219.10] Be the glue
[3219.10 → 3220.60] That binds us together
[3220.60 → 3223.24] We give thanks
[3223.24 → 3224.20] And ask for guidance
[3224.20 → 3225.76] For all of our staff members
[3225.76 → 3226.72] And our volunteers
[3226.72 → 3228.42] Who keep this church running
[3228.42 → 3230.54] We pray dear Lord
[3230.54 → 3231.84] That their efforts
[3231.84 → 3232.66] Will be blessed
[3232.66 → 3233.86] As they work
[3233.86 → 3234.72] To keep this
[3234.72 → 3236.18] A place of hope
[3236.18 → 3240.02] Lord bless our graduating youth
[3240.02 → 3242.34] Please guide them
[3242.34 → 3243.18] As they step into
[3243.18 → 3243.90] New chapters
[3243.90 → 3245.02] In their lives
[3245.02 → 3247.24] We pray Lord
[3247.24 → 3248.38] That they will always
[3248.38 → 3249.76] Experience the fullness
[3249.76 → 3250.70] Of life
[3250.70 → 3251.96] With you
[3251.96 → 3255.08] Help us all
[3255.08 → 3255.56] To remember
[3255.56 → 3256.60] Your promise
[3256.60 → 3257.32] To enter
[3257.32 → 3258.24] Any area
[3258.24 → 3259.06] Of our life
[3259.06 → 3260.38] That we open up
[3260.38 → 3260.82] To you
[3260.82 → 3262.68] When we dwell
[3262.68 → 3263.86] In our past failures
[3263.86 → 3265.80] Let us not forget
[3265.80 → 3267.46] That you our God
[3267.46 → 3268.36] Have delivered us
[3268.36 → 3268.94] From sin
[3268.94 → 3271.28] May we look
[3271.28 → 3272.16] At all the positive
[3272.16 → 3273.04] Things that you have
[3273.04 → 3274.12] Done for us
[3274.12 → 3275.42] And through us
[3275.42 → 3278.14] We ask that your spirit
[3278.14 → 3279.52] Will prompt each of us
[3279.52 → 3280.70] With many opportunities
[3280.70 → 3282.26] To demonstrate your love
[3282.26 → 3283.18] For one another
[3283.18 → 3285.60] And Lord
[3285.60 → 3287.76] We pray for Clayton Heights
[3287.76 → 3289.58] And for all the churches
[3289.58 → 3290.78] Who worship with us
[3290.78 → 3291.58] In this community
[3291.58 → 3293.52] We pray that you will
[3293.52 → 3294.34] Bless all of
[3294.34 → 3295.28] All of our churches
[3295.28 → 3297.30] And we pray that you'll
[3297.30 → 3298.56] Help us as we spread
[3298.56 → 3299.76] Your good news
[3299.76 → 3300.54] Of salvation
[3300.54 → 3303.98] Lord we lift
[3303.98 → 3304.74] Pastor Dave
[3304.74 → 3306.06] As he shares your message
[3306.06 → 3306.76] For us today
[3306.76 → 3308.48] We pray that we will
[3308.48 → 3309.80] Hear what we need
[3309.80 → 3310.30] To hear
[3310.30 → 3311.38] And that we can
[3311.38 → 3312.24] Take this message
[3312.24 → 3313.56] Out into our lives
[3313.56 → 3314.72] And into our community
[3314.72 → 3317.62] Lord we ask these things
[3317.62 → 3318.76] In the name of the Father
[3318.76 → 3320.72] In the name of the Son
[3320.72 → 3322.02] And in the name
[3322.02 → 3323.06] Of the Holy Spirit
[3323.06 → 3324.42] Amen
[3324.42 → 3330.60] At this point
[3330.60 → 3331.86] I just want to point out
[3331.86 → 3332.94] If you're new here
[3332.94 → 3334.00] We don't do an offering
[3334.00 → 3334.96] So you're going to be
[3334.96 → 3335.86] Waiting a long time
[3335.86 → 3336.32] If you're waiting
[3336.32 → 3337.16] For the offering plate
[3337.16 → 3337.70] To come by
[3337.70 → 3339.26] But what we do
[3339.26 → 3340.12] Is we have
[3340.12 → 3341.64] We have a giving station
[3341.64 → 3342.58] By the coffee maker
[3342.58 → 3344.00] And we also have
[3344.00 → 3344.88] A QR code
[3344.88 → 3345.54] In the back of your
[3345.54 → 3345.94] Bulletin
[3345.94 → 3347.12] For electronic giving
[3347.12 → 3347.76] If you want
[3347.76 → 3349.36] If you feel blessed
[3349.36 → 3350.52] And you want to contribute
[3350.52 → 3351.76] To the works of this church
[3351.76 → 3352.48] And this community
[3352.48 → 3353.86] You can give so
[3353.86 → 3354.40] At this time
[3354.40 → 3354.90] Thanks
[3354.90 → 3370.50] Well we are in the middle
[3370.50 → 3371.38] Of a sermon series
[3371.38 → 3372.40] On the Holy Spirit
[3372.40 → 3374.26] And so far we've looked
[3374.26 → 3374.98] At the way in which
[3374.98 → 3376.08] The Spirit was a gift
[3376.08 → 3377.12] Given at Pentecost
[3377.12 → 3378.72] That gives us a taste
[3378.72 → 3379.32] Of what's coming
[3379.32 → 3379.80] In the future
[3379.80 → 3380.82] When Christ returns
[3380.82 → 3382.14] That breaks into the present
[3382.14 → 3383.64] We've looked at the way
[3383.64 → 3384.78] That Jesus' own ministry
[3384.78 → 3385.70] Was empowered
[3385.70 → 3386.62] And in dependence
[3386.62 → 3387.56] On the person
[3387.56 → 3388.46] And work of the Spirit
[3388.46 → 3390.12] And last week
[3390.12 → 3391.18] Josiah who's preaching
[3391.18 → 3392.50] Gave us this beautiful vision
[3392.50 → 3393.30] Of a church
[3393.30 → 3394.10] Filled with the life
[3394.10 → 3394.62] Of the Spirit
[3394.62 → 3395.02] And I don't know
[3395.02 → 3396.04] If you remember that image
[3396.04 → 3397.28] But of the Spirit
[3397.28 → 3398.40] As this giant wave
[3398.40 → 3399.42] Engulfing the church
[3399.42 → 3400.50] And believers holding
[3400.50 → 3401.32] This little cup
[3401.32 → 3402.58] And that invitation
[3402.58 → 3403.80] To really invite
[3403.80 → 3405.34] The fullness of the life
[3405.34 → 3405.70] Of the Spirit
[3405.70 → 3407.06] To fill us as a community
[3407.06 → 3409.06] This morning we're going
[3409.06 → 3409.98] To look at one of the main
[3409.98 → 3410.76] Reasons the Spirit
[3410.76 → 3411.18] Is given
[3411.18 → 3412.28] And that is
[3412.28 → 3414.48] To make Jesus known
[3414.48 → 3416.20] Between the resurrection
[3416.20 → 3417.32] And Jesus' return
[3417.32 → 3418.22] We're given the Spirit
[3418.22 → 3419.78] So that we can bear witness
[3419.78 → 3421.06] And make Jesus known
[3421.06 → 3422.08] And so we're going to look
[3422.08 → 3423.20] At Acts chapter 1
[3423.20 → 3424.62] It's actually a passage
[3424.62 → 3425.22] That we looked at
[3425.22 → 3426.10] Just a few weeks ago
[3426.10 → 3427.32] That we're returning to
[3427.32 → 3428.86] As we reflect on
[3428.86 → 3429.72] The Spirit's work
[3429.72 → 3430.58] In the church
[3430.58 → 3431.26] So if you've got
[3431.26 → 3431.72] Your Bible
[3431.72 → 3432.84] Turn with me to
[3432.84 → 3433.52] Acts chapter 1
[3433.52 → 3433.92] We're going to read
[3433.92 → 3435.34] Verse 4 to 9 together
[3435.34 → 3441.36] On one occasion
[3441.36 → 3443.14] While Jesus was eating
[3443.14 → 3443.56] With them
[3443.56 → 3444.18] He gave them
[3444.18 → 3444.98] This command
[3444.98 → 3447.16] Do not leave Jerusalem
[3447.16 → 3448.34] But wait for the gift
[3448.34 → 3449.72] My Father promised
[3449.72 → 3450.80] Which you have heard
[3450.80 → 3451.62] Me speak about
[3451.62 → 3453.20] For John baptized
[3453.20 → 3453.76] With water
[3453.76 → 3454.70] But in a few days
[3454.70 → 3455.56] You will be baptized
[3455.56 → 3456.76] With the Holy Spirit
[3456.76 → 3458.72] So when they met together
[3458.72 → 3459.56] They asked him
[3459.56 → 3461.16] Lord are you at this time
[3461.16 → 3461.92] Going to restore
[3461.92 → 3463.20] The kingdom to Israel
[3463.20 → 3464.72] He said to them
[3464.72 → 3465.48] It is not for you
[3465.48 → 3466.36] To know the times
[3466.36 → 3466.92] Or dates
[3466.92 → 3467.78] The Father has set
[3467.78 → 3468.76] By his own authority
[3468.76 → 3470.86] But you will receive power
[3470.86 → 3472.20] When the Holy Spirit
[3472.20 → 3472.84] Comes on you
[3472.84 → 3473.64] And you will be
[3473.64 → 3474.44] My witnesses
[3474.44 → 3475.76] In Jerusalem
[3475.76 → 3477.32] In all Judea
[3477.32 → 3477.98] And Samaria
[3477.98 → 3479.38] And to the ends
[3479.38 → 3480.12] Of the earth
[3480.12 → 3481.84] After he said this
[3481.84 → 3482.52] He was taken up
[3482.52 → 3483.64] Before their very eyes
[3483.64 → 3484.68] And a cloud hid him
[3484.68 → 3485.92] From their sight
[3485.92 → 3491.06] Brittany and I
[3491.06 → 3491.90] Are one of those couples
[3491.90 → 3493.02] That struggle
[3493.02 → 3494.18] To find a show
[3494.18 → 3494.66] Or movie
[3494.66 → 3495.76] That we both like
[3495.76 → 3497.32] I'm just wondering
[3497.32 → 3498.36] If there's any other couples
[3498.36 → 3499.26] Like us
[3499.26 → 3499.98] In our church
[3499.98 → 3502.52] I would say
[3502.52 → 3503.86] Legend has it
[3503.86 → 3504.52] That there's a couple
[3504.52 → 3505.84] That was in the 9 a.m. service
[3505.84 → 3507.36] On Valentine's
[3507.36 → 3508.14] Not that long ago
[3508.14 → 3509.28] They went to a movie theatre
[3509.28 → 3510.30] And actually watched
[3510.30 → 3511.34] Different movies
[3511.34 → 3512.44] In the theatre
[3512.44 → 3513.66] Then they returned
[3513.66 → 3514.38] To Starbucks
[3514.38 → 3514.96] Afterwards
[3514.96 → 3515.64] To talk about
[3515.64 → 3516.06] Their movies
[3516.06 → 3516.48] And how much
[3516.48 → 3517.12] They loved it
[3517.12 → 3517.84] And that couple
[3517.84 → 3519.06] Lived happily ever after
[3519.06 → 3522.48] One of the few shows
[3522.48 → 3523.36] That are I should say
[3523.36 → 3523.88] Genres
[3523.88 → 3524.46] That my wife
[3524.46 → 3525.36] And I both enjoy
[3525.36 → 3526.64] Is crime
[3526.64 → 3527.46] And I would say
[3527.46 → 3527.98] Crime
[3527.98 → 3528.50] Or sort of
[3528.50 → 3529.94] Courtroom trials
[3529.94 → 3531.00] Kind of shows
[3531.00 → 3531.66] Anyone else with me
[3531.66 → 3532.00] On that
[3532.00 → 3533.10] There's something
[3533.10 → 3533.88] About sort of
[3533.88 → 3535.50] The how this crime
[3535.50 → 3536.14] Came to be
[3536.14 → 3537.28] The gathering of evidence
[3537.28 → 3538.22] The forming
[3538.22 → 3539.48] Of a plausible narrative
[3539.48 → 3540.70] That makes most sense
[3540.70 → 3541.34] Of what happened
[3541.34 → 3542.54] That just draws me in
[3542.54 → 3543.84] And if you've seen
[3543.84 → 3544.72] These crime dramas
[3544.72 → 3545.38] You'll know that
[3545.38 → 3546.78] An essential part of them
[3546.78 → 3548.20] Is the witnesses
[3548.20 → 3550.86] Calling forth to the stand
[3550.86 → 3551.84] Certain individuals
[3551.84 → 3552.50] That are related
[3552.50 → 3553.18] To what happened
[3553.18 → 3554.24] And they have to give
[3554.24 → 3554.96] Their account
[3554.96 → 3556.26] Of the events
[3556.26 → 3556.96] That took place
[3556.96 → 3557.88] How they remember
[3557.88 → 3559.16] The unfolding of events
[3559.16 → 3560.46] Their relationship
[3560.46 → 3561.74] To the person in question
[3561.74 → 3562.70] How they know
[3562.70 → 3563.38] The character
[3563.38 → 3564.52] And usually
[3564.52 → 3565.56] The testimony
[3565.56 → 3566.76] Of a good witness
[3566.76 → 3568.36] Changes the course
[3568.36 → 3569.04] Of the verdict
[3569.04 → 3572.36] In Acts chapter 1
[3572.36 → 3573.56] As Jesus prepares
[3573.56 → 3574.36] His disciples
[3574.36 → 3575.86] To receive the Holy Spirit
[3575.86 → 3577.44] He gives them
[3577.44 → 3578.08] A title
[3578.08 → 3580.04] He gives a category
[3580.04 → 3581.32] To define both
[3581.32 → 3581.96] The identity
[3581.96 → 3583.04] And the purpose
[3583.04 → 3583.74] Of the church
[3583.74 → 3584.02] And you know
[3584.02 → 3584.68] What that is?
[3585.86 → 3586.26] Witness
[3586.26 → 3588.14] Jesus says
[3588.14 → 3588.76] To his disciples
[3588.76 → 3591.16] You will be
[3591.16 → 3592.80] My witnesses
[3592.80 → 3595.16] Around the world
[3595.16 → 3596.90] You will be the people
[3596.90 → 3597.90] Who sort of testify
[3597.90 → 3599.16] To all that has happened
[3599.16 → 3600.44] To who that I am
[3600.44 → 3602.28] In front of a watching world
[3602.28 → 3603.58] And this morning
[3603.58 → 3604.32] We're going to unpack
[3604.32 → 3605.06] What Acts 1
[3605.06 → 3606.26] And other passages teach
[3606.26 → 3607.80] About how the Holy Spirit
[3607.80 → 3609.26] Empowers and equips
[3609.26 → 3609.84] The church
[3609.84 → 3611.00] To bear witness
[3611.00 → 3611.52] To Jesus
[3611.52 → 3612.42] In our words
[3612.42 → 3613.90] In our deeds
[3613.90 → 3615.52] And in our shared life
[3615.52 → 3616.68] That's where we're going
[3616.68 → 3617.22] This morning
[3617.22 → 3619.52] Now we touched on this
[3619.52 → 3620.60] A few weeks ago
[3620.60 → 3621.24] So I'm only going to
[3621.24 → 3622.18] Touch on it briefly today
[3622.18 → 3623.28] But the disciples
[3623.28 → 3624.36] Are grappling
[3624.36 → 3625.66] With the significance
[3625.66 → 3626.62] Of Jesus' resurrection
[3626.62 → 3628.46] They are overjoyed
[3628.46 → 3629.34] They are confused
[3629.34 → 3630.32] They are excited
[3630.32 → 3631.30] About what it means
[3631.30 → 3631.78] For them
[3631.78 → 3632.98] And they ask Jesus
[3632.98 → 3634.18] A genuine question
[3634.18 → 3634.52] They say
[3634.52 → 3634.90] Jesus
[3634.90 → 3636.88] Are you at this time
[3636.88 → 3638.84] Going to restore
[3638.84 → 3639.34] The kingdom
[3639.34 → 3640.74] To Israel
[3640.74 → 3642.32] And that was
[3642.32 → 3643.32] Their vision
[3643.32 → 3643.80] Of the kingdom
[3643.80 → 3644.60] Is that God
[3644.60 → 3645.22] Through the Messiah
[3645.22 → 3646.36] Was going to restore Israel
[3646.36 → 3647.24] Rebuild the city
[3647.24 → 3648.34] Make the temple great
[3648.34 → 3649.82] And Jesus' vision
[3649.82 → 3650.38] As they're going to see
[3650.38 → 3651.62] Is so much bigger
[3651.62 → 3652.30] But what he says
[3652.30 → 3652.54] To them
[3652.54 → 3653.22] Is almost confusing
[3653.22 → 3653.58] To them
[3653.58 → 3654.32] Because his response
[3654.32 → 3655.86] Is it's not for you
[3655.86 → 3656.42] To know
[3656.42 → 3658.26] The times and dates
[3658.26 → 3659.30] That the Father
[3659.30 → 3659.78] Has set
[3659.78 → 3661.08] By his own authority
[3661.08 → 3662.30] And Jesus here
[3662.30 → 3662.90] Is talking about
[3662.90 → 3663.40] The future
[3663.40 → 3664.74] He's talking about
[3664.74 → 3665.48] His return
[3665.48 → 3666.26] In glory
[3666.26 → 3666.80] And power
[3666.80 → 3667.50] When he restores
[3667.50 → 3668.12] Creation
[3668.12 → 3669.48] Restores his people
[3669.48 → 3670.28] Brings resurrection
[3670.28 → 3671.36] Of life from the dead
[3671.36 → 3672.56] And he's saying to them
[3672.56 → 3673.50] You don't need to know
[3673.50 → 3674.34] When that restoration
[3674.34 → 3674.96] Is coming
[3674.96 → 3676.80] And by the way
[3676.80 → 3677.68] Just out of curiosity
[3677.68 → 3678.22] This week
[3678.22 → 3679.08] I was googling
[3679.08 → 3680.18] End time dates
[3680.18 → 3680.86] Because you know
[3680.86 → 3681.76] Every year
[3681.76 → 3682.28] There's someone
[3682.28 → 3682.78] Who's predicting
[3682.78 → 3683.32] This is when
[3683.32 → 3683.98] The end is coming
[3683.98 → 3684.96] Even though Jesus says
[3684.96 → 3686.50] You do not need to know
[3686.50 → 3687.54] Only the Father knows
[3687.54 → 3688.74] And I found a website
[3688.74 → 3689.52] You don't need to look
[3689.52 → 3690.06] At this website
[3690.06 → 3691.24] But it's very interesting
[3691.24 → 3692.58] It's a Wikipedia page
[3692.58 → 3694.08] Dedicated to all the
[3694.08 → 3695.22] False predictions
[3695.22 → 3696.74] About the end times
[3696.74 → 3697.64] And it's a very
[3697.64 → 3698.96] Long website
[3698.96 → 3701.06] That's to the side
[3701.06 → 3702.50] But Jesus is preparing them
[3702.50 → 3703.74] For the date of his return
[3703.74 → 3704.88] And what he's really doing
[3704.88 → 3705.72] At another level
[3705.72 → 3706.28] Is saying
[3706.28 → 3708.10] Yes the kingdom of God
[3708.10 → 3708.66] Has come
[3708.66 → 3710.26] Resurrection life is here
[3710.26 → 3711.40] The spirit is coming
[3711.40 → 3712.16] You're going to be filled
[3712.16 → 3713.26] With transformative life
[3713.26 → 3713.96] By the spirit
[3713.96 → 3715.16] But the kingdom
[3715.16 → 3716.14] Has not come in its fullness
[3716.14 → 3717.10] Until I return
[3717.10 → 3718.74] And we all know this
[3718.74 → 3719.48] In our experience
[3719.48 → 3719.98] In fact
[3719.98 → 3720.72] What this is like
[3720.72 → 3721.92] Yes we celebrate
[3721.92 → 3722.68] New life
[3722.68 → 3723.74] Baptisms
[3723.74 → 3724.34] Conversion
[3724.34 → 3725.06] Transformation
[3725.06 → 3726.70] And at the same time
[3726.70 → 3727.78] Friends of ours
[3727.78 → 3728.34] Get diagnosed
[3728.34 → 3729.32] With terrible diseases
[3729.32 → 3730.62] Just yesterday
[3730.62 → 3731.22] A number of us
[3731.22 → 3731.72] Were at a funeral
[3731.72 → 3732.46] For Sid's mother
[3732.46 → 3733.98] And friends and loved ones
[3733.98 → 3734.72] Of ours die
[3734.72 → 3735.90] Because all is not
[3735.90 → 3736.70] Well with the world
[3736.70 → 3737.74] And we wait
[3737.74 → 3738.18] For the kingdom
[3738.18 → 3739.02] To come in its fullness
[3739.02 → 3739.96] It's already here
[3739.96 → 3741.04] But it's not here
[3741.04 → 3741.58] In its fullness
[3741.58 → 3743.90] And so Jesus then
[3743.90 → 3744.78] In this space
[3744.78 → 3745.84] Of the already not yet
[3745.84 → 3746.66] Says to his disciples
[3746.66 → 3748.06] As you wait
[3748.06 → 3748.94] For my return
[3748.94 → 3750.32] Between the resurrection
[3750.32 → 3751.12] And my return
[3751.12 → 3753.18] This is your task
[3753.18 → 3753.96] And this is what he says
[3753.96 → 3754.34] To them
[3754.34 → 3755.44] In verse 8
[3755.44 → 3756.24] Of our passage
[3756.24 → 3759.14] You will receive power
[3759.14 → 3760.56] When the Holy Spirit
[3760.56 → 3761.38] Comes on you
[3761.38 → 3762.94] And you will be
[3762.94 → 3763.74] My witnesses
[3763.74 → 3764.78] In Jerusalem
[3764.78 → 3765.50] Judea
[3765.50 → 3766.12] Samaria
[3766.12 → 3767.50] And British Columbia
[3767.50 → 3768.36] Because that's
[3768.36 → 3769.12] The end of the earth
[3769.12 → 3770.10] If you look at Jerusalem
[3770.10 → 3770.74] On the map
[3770.74 → 3773.20] Jesus says
[3773.20 → 3774.88] Your identity
[3774.88 → 3775.76] And your purpose
[3775.76 → 3778.06] Is to be witnessing
[3778.06 → 3779.46] To me
[3779.46 → 3781.74] That's the purpose
[3781.74 → 3782.36] You have
[3782.36 → 3783.74] Until I return
[3783.74 → 3785.28] And my question for us
[3785.28 → 3786.96] Is do we believe that?
[3787.76 → 3789.12] Do we see ourselves
[3789.12 → 3789.76] Individually
[3789.76 → 3791.12] And as a church family
[3791.12 → 3792.98] As defined by
[3792.98 → 3794.18] Witness
[3794.18 → 3795.58] And by the way
[3795.58 → 3796.36] Jesus doesn't say
[3796.36 → 3797.46] You will do my witness
[3797.46 → 3797.84] He says
[3797.84 → 3799.52] You are my witnesses
[3799.52 → 3800.84] It's something that you are
[3800.84 → 3801.44] As a being
[3801.44 → 3802.32] That's to say
[3802.32 → 3803.66] It's not just a question
[3803.66 → 3804.34] As a Christian
[3804.34 → 3806.78] Am I a witness or not
[3806.78 → 3807.28] The question is
[3807.28 → 3808.10] How faithfully
[3808.10 → 3809.36] Am I living into
[3809.36 → 3810.44] My identity and calling
[3810.44 → 3812.40] As a witness to Jesus Christ
[3812.40 → 3813.56] Do we give credible
[3813.56 → 3814.90] Testimony in our words
[3814.90 → 3815.66] And our lives
[3815.66 → 3817.12] To the resurrection of Jesus
[3817.12 → 3818.60] And everything he is
[3818.60 → 3820.76] And this is
[3820.76 → 3822.18] Exhumed in our passage
[3822.18 → 3822.68] But I'm actually
[3822.68 → 3823.20] Going to draw it
[3823.20 → 3823.74] To the foreground
[3823.74 → 3825.28] That when Jesus says
[3825.28 → 3826.24] You are my witnesses
[3826.24 → 3827.98] He assumes that it's
[3827.98 → 3829.82] A public witness
[3829.82 → 3831.32] He's sending his disciples
[3831.32 → 3832.36] To Judea
[3832.36 → 3832.86] And yes
[3832.86 → 3834.24] There are believers in Judea
[3834.24 → 3834.90] But guess where he's
[3834.90 → 3835.72] Sending them as well
[3835.72 → 3836.76] Samaria
[3836.76 → 3838.22] There are no churches
[3838.22 → 3839.46] And believers in Samaria
[3839.46 → 3840.30] Therefore the church
[3840.30 → 3841.00] Must plant
[3841.00 → 3842.08] And share
[3842.08 → 3843.48] And make Jesus known
[3843.48 → 3845.48] And also it goes on
[3845.48 → 3846.44] To the ends of the earth
[3846.44 → 3847.36] We are to bear
[3847.36 → 3848.86] Public witness to Jesus
[3848.86 → 3850.16] And why I want to
[3850.16 → 3851.24] Emphasize that point
[3851.24 → 3852.56] Is that in our
[3852.56 → 3853.34] Imaginations
[3853.34 → 3854.06] As Christians
[3854.06 → 3854.76] And even as people
[3854.76 → 3855.66] Who are not part of the church
[3855.66 → 3857.04] We think of Christianity
[3857.04 → 3858.52] As a private religion
[3858.52 → 3859.36] Right
[3859.36 → 3860.00] There's sort of
[3860.00 → 3860.80] The public world
[3860.80 → 3861.62] Which operates by
[3861.62 → 3862.58] Secular things
[3862.58 → 3863.24] And then there's
[3863.24 → 3864.46] This religion stuff
[3864.46 → 3864.98] And it's not just
[3864.98 → 3865.38] Christianity
[3865.38 → 3865.96] It's Islam
[3865.96 → 3866.52] Buddhism
[3866.52 → 3867.34] Sikhism
[3867.34 → 3867.80] All the rest
[3867.80 → 3868.98] They're just private religions
[3868.98 → 3870.22] We gather on Sundays
[3870.22 → 3871.42] We do our thing
[3871.42 → 3872.12] Then we go back out
[3872.12 → 3872.56] To the public
[3872.56 → 3873.80] And we keep quiet
[3873.80 → 3874.88] About Jesus
[3874.88 → 3877.24] Let me read for us
[3877.24 → 3878.24] What I think is a very
[3878.24 → 3879.06] Challenging quote
[3879.06 → 3880.04] From Leslie New begin
[3880.04 → 3881.48] About the early church
[3881.48 → 3882.72] And how it understood itself
[3882.72 → 3884.20] As a religion
[3884.20 → 3886.02] The early church
[3886.02 → 3887.00] Did not see itself
[3887.00 → 3887.68] As a private
[3887.68 → 3888.78] Religious society
[3888.78 → 3890.24] Competing with others
[3890.24 → 3891.72] To offer personal salvation
[3891.72 → 3892.46] To its members
[3892.46 → 3894.06] It saw itself
[3894.06 → 3894.60] As a movement
[3894.60 → 3895.48] Launched
[3895.48 → 3896.96] Into the public life
[3896.96 → 3897.64] Of the world
[3897.64 → 3899.44] Challenging the rule
[3899.44 → 3899.98] Of Caesar
[3899.98 → 3901.38] No small task
[3901.38 → 3902.74] Claiming the allegiance
[3902.74 → 3904.12] Of all without exception
[3904.12 → 3905.26] As a community
[3905.26 → 3906.20] They rejected
[3906.20 → 3907.36] The idolatrous claims
[3907.36 → 3908.02] Of their culture
[3908.02 → 3910.04] And lived their whole lives
[3910.04 → 3911.06] Under the authority
[3911.06 → 3912.52] Of another lord
[3912.52 → 3913.72] Do we see ourselves
[3913.72 → 3915.34] As that
[3915.34 → 3918.04] Or do we see ourselves
[3918.04 → 3918.74] As a private
[3918.74 → 3920.38] Religious community
[3920.38 → 3921.92] Now I remember
[3921.92 → 3923.36] Eight years ago or so
[3923.36 → 3924.20] This church building
[3924.20 → 3924.64] Was built
[3924.64 → 3925.60] Some of you were there
[3925.60 → 3926.82] You may remember this
[3926.82 → 3928.12] And the Coverdale reporter
[3928.12 → 3929.52] Actually ran an article
[3929.52 → 3930.72] About our church
[3930.72 → 3931.34] And it was published
[3931.34 → 3931.88] In the newspaper
[3931.88 → 3932.96] I still have it in my office
[3932.96 → 3934.68] And they ran a kind article
[3934.68 → 3935.68] I mean they quoted
[3935.68 → 3936.28] Pastor Sid
[3936.28 → 3937.34] He said some kind things
[3937.34 → 3938.26] He had no idea
[3938.26 → 3939.04] What he was talking about
[3939.04 → 3939.96] What our church would be like
[3939.96 → 3940.74] But he knew
[3940.74 → 3941.96] To say that our church
[3941.96 → 3942.42] Was built
[3942.42 → 3943.86] With community needs in mind
[3943.86 → 3944.86] And I remember
[3944.86 → 3945.98] First reading that article
[3945.98 → 3948.10] On the online version
[3948.10 → 3949.86] And there was one comment
[3949.86 → 3951.16] Posted on the bottom of it
[3951.16 → 3951.70] And you want to know
[3951.70 → 3952.12] What it read
[3952.12 → 3953.72] This is what it read
[3953.72 → 3954.94] I remember by memory
[3954.94 → 3956.70] Dripping with sarcasm
[3956.70 → 3957.62] This is what someone said
[3957.62 → 3958.08] They said
[3958.08 → 3958.92] Great
[3958.92 → 3960.96] Just what the world
[3960.96 → 3962.08] Doesn't need
[3962.08 → 3964.00] Another private
[3964.00 → 3965.36] Religious clubhouse
[3965.36 → 3966.32] For believers
[3966.32 → 3969.72] And I remember being
[3969.72 → 3970.44] A bit frustrated
[3970.44 → 3970.96] And discouraged
[3970.96 → 3971.62] By that comment
[3971.62 → 3972.52] But I thought to myself
[3972.52 → 3973.80] I bet you this person
[3973.80 → 3974.74] Grew up in church
[3974.74 → 3976.42] I bet you they left
[3976.42 → 3976.82] The church
[3976.82 → 3977.20] Because they were
[3977.20 → 3978.28] So disenfranchised
[3978.28 → 3979.56] By how much of a little
[3979.56 → 3980.54] Religious club
[3980.54 → 3981.48] It felt like
[3981.48 → 3982.74] And I will say to you
[3982.74 → 3983.84] That God has used
[3983.84 → 3984.78] That criticism
[3984.78 → 3986.76] To spark my imagination
[3986.76 → 3987.94] As we think about ministry
[3987.94 → 3989.36] And serving our community
[3989.36 → 3991.32] How we can be a church
[3991.32 → 3992.80] That bears witness
[3992.80 → 3993.68] To the love of Jesus
[3993.68 → 3995.80] And shows in our deeds
[3995.80 → 3996.44] The love of Jesus
[3996.44 → 3997.16] In our city
[3997.16 → 4000.22] The question I think
[4000.22 → 4001.14] A lot of us have
[4001.14 → 4004.06] Is how do we witness
[4004.06 → 4005.06] To Jesus
[4005.06 → 4007.32] Like we know we're sent
[4007.32 → 4009.10] We have some sense
[4009.10 → 4010.60] Of being put into the world
[4010.60 → 4011.36] By Christ himself
[4011.36 → 4011.94] To bear witness
[4011.94 → 4013.00] But how do we do this
[4013.00 → 4014.60] And just out of curiosity
[4014.60 → 4015.76] You can say this out loud
[4015.76 → 4017.10] What's the first thing
[4017.10 → 4017.90] That comes to mind
[4017.90 → 4018.94] When you hear the word
[4018.94 → 4020.00] Witness
[4020.00 → 4022.88] Evangelism
[4022.88 → 4023.42] Anyone else
[4023.42 → 4025.26] Door to door
[4025.26 → 4030.02] The 9am was a lot less than you
[4030.02 → 4031.46] And you guys are a lot quieter than them
[4031.46 → 4032.54] Evangelism door to door
[4032.54 → 4033.32] Anything else come to mind
[4033.32 → 4035.22] Testimony
[4035.22 → 4035.66] Speaking
[4035.66 → 4037.22] You're all right
[4037.22 → 4038.62] Aren't you
[4038.62 → 4040.18] It's a bit of nerve wracking
[4040.18 → 4040.74] To say out loud
[4040.74 → 4041.28] What you're thinking
[4041.28 → 4042.74] When we think of witness
[4042.74 → 4044.38] We think of verbal sharing
[4044.38 → 4045.02] Of the gospel
[4045.02 → 4045.34] Right
[4045.34 → 4046.40] We share our faith
[4046.40 → 4047.58] We speak out loud
[4047.58 → 4048.26] What we believe
[4048.26 → 4049.52] We let people know
[4049.52 → 4050.44] In our voices
[4050.44 → 4051.82] What it is that we have
[4051.82 → 4053.58] We believe about with Jesus
[4053.58 → 4055.60] And I want to suggest
[4055.60 → 4056.34] I'm going to spend some time
[4056.34 → 4057.00] Unpacking this
[4057.00 → 4058.66] That witnessing to Jesus
[4058.66 → 4060.66] Is absolutely evangelism
[4060.66 → 4061.58] It is our words
[4061.58 → 4064.18] But it is also our deeds
[4064.18 → 4066.16] And our shared life
[4066.16 → 4067.54] And I want to suggest
[4067.54 → 4068.24] That when these things
[4068.24 → 4069.40] Are all put together
[4069.40 → 4071.94] There is a beautiful symphony
[4071.94 → 4072.86] Of witness
[4072.86 → 4074.66] To the person of Jesus Christ
[4074.66 → 4076.24] So let's look at these
[4076.24 → 4077.12] Three things in order
[4077.12 → 4079.58] Witness absolutely involves
[4079.58 → 4081.06] Speaking about Jesus
[4081.06 → 4082.34] And if you grew up
[4082.34 → 4082.96] In the Reformed church
[4082.96 → 4084.14] This is not going to be news to you
[4084.14 → 4085.22] But some people coming in
[4085.22 → 4086.26] It's important to say this
[4086.26 → 4088.24] Evangelism has never been
[4088.24 → 4089.06] The spiritual gift
[4089.06 → 4089.86] Of our denomination
[4089.86 → 4091.30] In fact most people pray
[4091.30 → 4092.72] They don't have the spiritual gift
[4092.72 → 4093.44] Of evangelism
[4093.44 → 4094.92] Because it's so terrifying
[4094.92 → 4095.90] Tell me I'm wrong
[4095.90 → 4097.92] We are very nervous
[4097.92 → 4099.14] When it comes to speaking out loud
[4099.14 → 4099.74] About Christianity
[4099.74 → 4101.04] Not only because
[4101.04 → 4103.58] We live in a post-Christian society
[4103.58 → 4105.18] That sort of heard about Jesus
[4105.18 → 4106.22] And said no thanks
[4106.22 → 4107.60] But also because
[4107.60 → 4108.84] We are terrified
[4108.84 → 4110.52] To know how to tell people
[4110.52 → 4111.26] About Jesus
[4111.26 → 4114.38] And perhaps I'll add this
[4114.38 → 4116.64] We've seen some terrible models of it
[4116.64 → 4117.74] Perhaps you know of someone
[4117.74 → 4118.50] Who shared the gospel
[4118.50 → 4119.66] And it's contrived
[4119.66 → 4120.44] It's mechanical
[4120.44 → 4121.32] It's forced
[4121.32 → 4123.58] It's too sort of programmatic
[4123.58 → 4124.50] And it forces people
[4124.50 → 4125.28] Into a certain mould
[4125.28 → 4126.36] And sort of like no thank you
[4126.36 → 4127.28] Or you picture sort of
[4127.28 → 4128.26] The angry person
[4128.26 → 4129.28] On the street corner
[4129.28 → 4130.02] With a bullhorn
[4130.02 → 4131.32] Although I have never seen that
[4131.32 → 4131.82] In my life
[4131.82 → 4133.06] And I don't think it exists much
[4133.06 → 4133.54] In Vancouver
[4133.54 → 4135.06] So we've seen these terrible
[4135.06 → 4135.98] Examples of it
[4135.98 → 4138.60] But sharing verbally
[4138.60 → 4139.28] About Jesus
[4139.28 → 4140.40] At its best
[4140.40 → 4142.96] Is simply sharing with people
[4142.96 → 4144.26] About the person
[4144.26 → 4145.26] Who's changed your life
[4145.26 → 4147.48] In a sense I think
[4147.48 → 4148.42] The best evangelism
[4148.42 → 4149.34] Is storytelling
[4149.34 → 4150.56] It's saying
[4150.56 → 4152.20] This is why I'm a believer
[4152.20 → 4154.06] This is why I
[4154.06 → 4155.08] Am part of the church
[4155.08 → 4155.74] Of Jesus Christ
[4155.74 → 4156.86] This is why I worship
[4156.86 → 4157.76] On Sunday morning
[4157.76 → 4160.12] One of my favourite stories
[4160.12 → 4160.90] Of evangelism
[4160.90 → 4161.92] Actually comes from
[4161.92 → 4163.04] Workplace environment
[4163.04 → 4164.52] There's a guy who's working
[4164.52 → 4165.68] His boss was a Christian
[4165.68 → 4167.18] And his boss must have
[4167.18 → 4167.98] Had something on the wall
[4167.98 → 4169.28] That made it clear
[4169.28 → 4169.94] That he was a Christian
[4169.94 → 4170.88] And this guy finally
[4170.88 → 4171.54] Built up the courage
[4171.54 → 4172.16] To say to his boss
[4172.16 → 4173.54] Why are you a Christian?
[4173.74 → 4175.46] Like what about this thing
[4175.46 → 4176.26] Makes you want to be
[4176.26 → 4176.98] A follower of Jesus?
[4177.34 → 4177.84] And the boss
[4177.84 → 4179.40] Not an articulate guy
[4179.40 → 4180.14] Not someone who's
[4180.14 → 4181.38] Very gifted in talking
[4181.38 → 4181.92] About his faith
[4181.92 → 4183.62] He started just to talk
[4183.62 → 4184.38] About his faith
[4184.38 → 4185.40] And share why he was
[4185.40 → 4185.66] A believer
[4185.66 → 4186.66] And then he got choked up
[4186.66 → 4188.22] And he cut himself off
[4188.22 → 4188.74] And he said
[4188.74 → 4189.08] You know
[4189.08 → 4191.10] I find it so hard
[4191.10 → 4191.72] To summarize
[4191.72 → 4193.48] How significantly
[4193.48 → 4194.82] Jesus has changed my life
[4194.82 → 4196.72] And it was a bit
[4196.72 → 4197.68] Of an awkward conversation
[4197.68 → 4198.54] But here's the thing
[4198.54 → 4200.08] That guy walked
[4200.08 → 4201.48] Out of his boss's office
[4201.48 → 4203.22] With a deep desire
[4203.22 → 4204.14] To understand
[4204.14 → 4205.76] What in the world
[4205.76 → 4207.26] About Jesus Christ
[4207.26 → 4209.18] Makes his boss weepy
[4209.18 → 4210.90] That's evangelism
[4210.90 → 4212.50] And I want to say
[4212.50 → 4213.60] Just as clear as I can
[4213.60 → 4215.04] I've been so encouraged
[4215.04 → 4216.52] I mean very encouraged
[4216.52 → 4218.10] By the number of people
[4218.10 → 4218.52] In our church
[4218.52 → 4219.34] Who have shared stories
[4219.34 → 4220.04] Of being with a friend
[4220.04 → 4220.60] A co-worker
[4220.60 → 4221.36] Or a classmate
[4221.36 → 4222.44] And feeling prompted
[4222.44 → 4223.12] By the spirit
[4223.12 → 4223.76] To speak up
[4223.76 → 4224.90] You know what I'm talking about
[4224.90 → 4225.86] Where you're just like
[4225.86 → 4226.92] I think I need to say something
[4226.92 → 4227.66] I think I need to just
[4227.66 → 4228.78] Tell my story
[4228.78 → 4230.30] Or just bring something up
[4230.30 → 4231.24] That tells about Jesus
[4231.24 → 4232.34] And you've done that
[4232.34 → 4233.36] And I've been so encouraged
[4233.36 → 4234.56] Because people are here
[4234.56 → 4235.36] In our church
[4235.36 → 4237.00] Have come to faith
[4237.00 → 4238.48] Through those promptings
[4238.48 → 4239.62] And through your words
[4239.62 → 4240.66] I mean Timothy
[4240.66 → 4241.44] I don't know if you heard that
[4241.44 → 4241.96] Where's Ed?
[4242.40 → 4242.96] Are you here Ed?
[4244.56 → 4245.22] I saw his kids
[4245.22 → 4245.92] His kids are saying
[4245.92 → 4246.36] He's not here
[4246.36 → 4247.42] You're here without your dad
[4247.42 → 4247.98] Good on you
[4247.98 → 4250.02] He was at the earlier service
[4250.02 → 4251.60] But Ed shared the faith
[4251.60 → 4252.30] With Timothy
[4252.30 → 4252.90] And you're here
[4252.90 → 4253.96] Because someone spoke
[4253.96 → 4254.58] About Jesus
[4254.58 → 4255.34] Praise the Lord
[4255.34 → 4257.06] Do not be surprised
[4257.06 → 4258.66] At what Jesus does
[4258.66 → 4260.08] When the spirit of God
[4260.08 → 4261.60] Propels us to speak up
[4261.60 → 4262.64] About Jesus
[4262.64 → 4265.30] That's one dimension
[4265.30 → 4265.78] Of witness
[4265.78 → 4267.36] Our verbal evangelism
[4267.36 → 4270.66] Another equally critical part
[4270.66 → 4271.54] Of evangelism
[4271.54 → 4273.04] Is our deeds
[4273.04 → 4276.04] Living what we believe
[4276.04 → 4277.06] In fact let me put it this way
[4277.06 → 4278.36] It is dangerous
[4278.36 → 4279.38] To share about Jesus
[4279.38 → 4280.52] If you do not have a life
[4280.52 → 4281.40] That lines up
[4281.40 → 4282.28] To some degree
[4282.28 → 4283.68] With what we are speaking about
[4283.68 → 4284.46] Nothing undercuts
[4284.46 → 4285.44] Our witness faster
[4285.44 → 4286.18] Than the people
[4286.18 → 4286.90] Who talk about Jesus
[4286.90 → 4288.50] Not living out
[4288.50 → 4289.30] The life of Jesus
[4289.30 → 4290.56] That's why it's so horrific
[4290.56 → 4292.14] When pastors on stages
[4292.14 → 4293.04] Are talking all these things
[4293.04 → 4293.48] About Jesus
[4293.48 → 4294.70] And then these horrible
[4294.70 → 4296.16] Misconduct
[4296.16 → 4296.76] These actions
[4296.76 → 4297.52] And accusations
[4297.52 → 4298.32] Are brought against them
[4298.32 → 4299.06] Because they're not living
[4299.06 → 4299.80] What they believe
[4299.80 → 4300.62] Now I get it
[4300.62 → 4301.86] All of us to some degree
[4301.86 → 4303.10] Do not live fully in sync
[4303.10 → 4304.10] With what we believe
[4304.10 → 4305.18] But there is a sense
[4305.18 → 4306.58] In which we have to practice
[4306.58 → 4307.98] What we preach
[4307.98 → 4309.82] That was by the way
[4309.82 → 4310.82] A rebuke in the Unholy
[4310.82 → 4311.38] Growing up
[4311.38 → 4312.38] We'd be fighting
[4312.38 → 4313.04] Or doing something
[4313.04 → 4313.94] And my parents would come in
[4313.94 → 4315.76] Practice what you preach
[4315.76 → 4316.98] And there's something
[4316.98 → 4317.68] Really important
[4317.68 → 4318.68] About that advice
[4318.68 → 4320.66] A family member of mine
[4320.66 → 4321.74] Has often said
[4321.74 → 4322.88] That we think of the world
[4322.88 → 4324.34] As listening to us
[4324.34 → 4324.86] With ears
[4324.86 → 4325.52] Waiting to hear
[4325.52 → 4326.24] What Christians believe
[4326.24 → 4327.14] But in fact
[4327.14 → 4328.84] They're watching
[4328.84 → 4330.02] How we live
[4330.02 → 4331.96] And what they want to know
[4331.96 → 4332.44] Our friends
[4332.44 → 4332.82] And neighbours
[4332.82 → 4333.36] And co-workers
[4333.36 → 4334.38] What they want to know is
[4334.38 → 4336.24] How does what you believe
[4336.24 → 4336.92] About Jesus
[4336.92 → 4339.84] Change your ordinary life
[4339.84 → 4341.28] How does it change
[4341.28 → 4342.36] The way you spend your money
[4342.36 → 4343.34] How does it change
[4343.34 → 4344.10] The way you live
[4344.10 → 4344.94] In your relationships
[4344.94 → 4345.64] Your friendships
[4345.64 → 4346.30] Your marriage
[4346.30 → 4347.06] With your kids
[4347.06 → 4347.86] How does it change
[4347.86 → 4348.98] The way you care for the poor
[4348.98 → 4350.02] And the way you live
[4350.02 → 4351.52] In your work day
[4351.52 → 4352.60] Day in and day out
[4352.60 → 4353.70] Show me
[4353.70 → 4355.02] What it looks like
[4355.02 → 4355.76] To follow Jesus
[4355.76 → 4357.08] Give us a glimpse
[4357.08 → 4357.90] On the ground
[4357.90 → 4359.62] Of the practical changes
[4359.62 → 4360.26] It makes
[4360.26 → 4361.26] And let me tell you
[4361.26 → 4363.14] That is often
[4363.14 → 4364.52] Where things happen
[4364.52 → 4365.48] In fact
[4365.48 → 4365.76] I don't know
[4365.76 → 4366.60] If I've shared this before
[4366.60 → 4367.88] And I haven't fact-checked
[4367.88 → 4368.72] This as well
[4368.72 → 4369.80] But I'm told that
[4369.80 → 4371.18] In most of the New Testament
[4371.18 → 4373.66] Most of the evangelism
[4373.66 → 4374.68] Was in response
[4374.68 → 4375.84] To people seeing
[4375.84 → 4377.14] Christians live their lives
[4377.14 → 4378.08] In a distinctive way
[4378.08 → 4379.70] And then asking questions
[4379.70 → 4380.80] About why they're living
[4380.80 → 4381.28] That way
[4381.28 → 4382.12] And then the Christians
[4382.12 → 4383.68] Have to speak about Jesus
[4383.68 → 4384.70] Because people have asked
[4384.70 → 4385.22] Them a question
[4385.22 → 4388.18] That's my kind of evangelism
[4388.18 → 4388.82] It's like you've lived
[4388.82 → 4389.80] Such a distinctive life
[4389.80 → 4391.20] People are asking questions
[4391.20 → 4392.52] And then you have to talk
[4392.52 → 4392.98] About it
[4392.98 → 4394.38] Because you're living faithfully
[4394.38 → 4395.60] That's a beautiful
[4395.60 → 4396.60] Kind of evangelism
[4396.60 → 4398.08] So words
[4398.08 → 4398.92] Deeds
[4398.92 → 4399.98] And here's a third thing
[4399.98 → 4401.68] That I did not
[4401.68 → 4402.64] Take seriously enough
[4402.64 → 4403.40] Until I've gotten
[4403.40 → 4403.92] A bit older
[4403.92 → 4404.42] And that is
[4404.42 → 4405.24] The shared life
[4405.24 → 4405.82] Of the church
[4405.82 → 4407.08] And part of why
[4407.08 → 4407.68] I think this matters
[4407.68 → 4408.14] So much
[4408.14 → 4408.90] Is because I've seen
[4408.90 → 4409.56] It is an essential
[4409.56 → 4410.40] Part of conversion
[4410.40 → 4411.76] In people within our church
[4411.76 → 4412.78] It's one thing
[4412.78 → 4413.64] To hear the gospel
[4413.64 → 4415.02] You see it in some lives
[4415.02 → 4416.62] But it's when you watch
[4416.62 → 4417.66] The way Christians
[4417.66 → 4419.24] Live with each other
[4419.24 → 4420.78] That sort of gives
[4420.78 → 4421.36] A clarity
[4421.36 → 4422.18] About what this faith
[4422.18 → 4422.74] Is all about
[4422.74 → 4423.92] It's watching Christians
[4423.92 → 4424.38] Worship
[4424.38 → 4425.82] Watching us pray
[4425.82 → 4426.46] Watching them
[4426.46 → 4427.64] Take communion together
[4427.64 → 4428.58] Share hospitality
[4428.58 → 4429.24] In each other's homes
[4429.24 → 4430.58] Just the ordinary life
[4430.58 → 4430.96] We live
[4430.96 → 4431.68] That catches people
[4431.68 → 4432.02] Saying
[4432.02 → 4432.78] Okay
[4432.78 → 4434.20] There's something
[4434.20 → 4434.90] Different here
[4434.90 → 4435.94] This is different
[4435.94 → 4436.26] Than the way
[4436.26 → 4437.06] My family lives
[4437.06 → 4437.52] Different the way
[4437.52 → 4438.48] My workplace is
[4438.48 → 4439.36] There's something
[4439.36 → 4440.30] That's very different
[4440.30 → 4441.00] About these Christians
[4441.00 → 4442.30] And it's compelling
[4442.30 → 4444.96] The words
[4444.96 → 4446.04] The deeds
[4446.04 → 4446.96] And the shared life
[4446.96 → 4447.28] Of the church
[4447.28 → 4447.86] When these things
[4447.86 → 4448.48] Come together
[4448.48 → 4449.50] It is a beautiful
[4449.50 → 4450.76] Symphony
[4450.76 → 4452.08] Of mission
[4452.08 → 4454.56] It bears credible
[4454.56 → 4455.04] Witness
[4455.04 → 4456.70] To what Jesus Christ
[4456.70 → 4457.34] Has done
[4457.34 → 4458.52] It shows people
[4458.52 → 4458.86] Hey
[4458.86 → 4460.02] What we believe
[4460.02 → 4460.50] About the death
[4460.50 → 4460.98] And resurrection
[4460.98 → 4462.32] Has impacted us
[4462.32 → 4463.14] It's changing
[4463.14 → 4463.80] How we believe
[4463.80 → 4465.02] And we believe
[4465.02 → 4466.10] That it's good news
[4466.10 → 4466.68] For the world
[4466.68 → 4468.34] That's why
[4468.34 → 4469.14] Jesus tells us
[4469.14 → 4469.72] To invite the world
[4469.72 → 4470.78] To repent and believe
[4470.78 → 4472.42] Because it's good news
[4472.42 → 4473.66] And if it's good news
[4473.66 → 4474.14] For you
[4474.14 → 4475.60] It's good news
[4475.60 → 4476.32] For everybody
[4476.32 → 4480.54] Now that brings me
[4480.54 → 4482.22] To one final point
[4482.22 → 4483.22] About this thing
[4483.22 → 4483.88] Of witness
[4483.88 → 4485.14] That I prefer
[4485.14 → 4486.14] Not to talk about
[4486.14 → 4487.58] But I can't
[4487.58 → 4489.10] And you'll see
[4489.10 → 4489.60] Why in a minute
[4489.60 → 4490.12] Do you know
[4490.12 → 4490.94] The Greek word
[4490.94 → 4492.06] Behind witness
[4492.06 → 4493.02] What the Greek word is
[4493.02 → 4495.14] No Greek scholars here
[4495.14 → 4495.96] It's Marcus
[4495.96 → 4497.48] Guess what other word
[4497.48 → 4498.16] We get from that
[4498.16 → 4498.68] Greek word
[4498.68 → 4500.26] Martyr
[4500.26 → 4503.22] We have
[4503.22 → 4504.36] A long history
[4504.36 → 4505.38] Of Christianity
[4505.38 → 4506.22] Around the world
[4506.22 → 4507.42] And in the
[4507.42 → 4508.90] History of the church
[4508.90 → 4510.42] Where believers
[4510.42 → 4511.86] Have spoken about Jesus
[4511.86 → 4513.24] Lived faithfully
[4513.24 → 4514.02] And followed Jesus
[4514.02 → 4515.46] Churches that embody
[4515.46 → 4516.20] The life of Jesus
[4516.20 → 4517.62] And they have suffered
[4517.62 → 4518.92] For it
[4518.92 → 4520.78] It could be something
[4520.78 → 4522.38] As simple as being ostracized
[4522.38 → 4523.18] As we see in the case
[4523.18 → 4523.78] Of 1 Peter
[4523.78 → 4524.92] It could be the case
[4524.92 → 4525.92] Of like losing positions
[4525.92 → 4526.36] Of power
[4526.36 → 4527.16] Losing jobs
[4527.16 → 4528.22] Losing social status
[4528.22 → 4529.62] And imprisonment
[4529.62 → 4530.24] And death
[4530.24 → 4531.56] For witnessing
[4531.56 → 4533.00] To the resurrection
[4533.00 → 4534.32] Of Jesus Christ
[4534.32 → 4536.98] Now we happen to live
[4536.98 → 4538.04] At a relatively
[4538.04 → 4539.58] Peaceful moment
[4539.58 → 4540.56] Here in Canada
[4540.56 → 4541.32] We can gather
[4541.32 → 4541.92] In safety
[4541.92 → 4542.78] Most of the time
[4542.78 → 4543.72] We can speak in safety
[4543.72 → 4544.68] But I'm aware
[4544.68 → 4545.66] And I've heard
[4545.66 → 4546.10] From a number
[4546.10 → 4546.92] Of people in our church
[4546.92 → 4548.22] That it's tricky
[4548.22 → 4549.06] To speak about
[4549.06 → 4549.68] Jesus Christ
[4549.68 → 4550.40] As Lord and Saviour
[4550.40 → 4551.32] In your workplace
[4551.32 → 4552.64] In your school
[4552.64 → 4553.68] There are many
[4553.68 → 4554.30] Of our industries
[4554.30 → 4555.54] That have an HR policy
[4555.54 → 4556.02] That says
[4556.02 → 4557.60] You cannot talk
[4557.60 → 4558.54] About Jesus
[4558.54 → 4559.74] And I do not know
[4559.74 → 4560.62] What the future holds
[4560.62 → 4561.40] For the church of Jesus
[4561.40 → 4562.10] Here in the west
[4562.10 → 4563.48] But I do know this
[4563.48 → 4565.14] That when Jesus
[4565.14 → 4565.98] Invites disciples
[4565.98 → 4566.78] To follow him
[4566.78 → 4568.12] When Jesus
[4568.12 → 4568.92] Tells his disciples
[4568.92 → 4569.46] Who he is
[4569.46 → 4570.42] He says in Mark 8
[4570.42 → 4571.06] Verse 34
[4571.06 → 4573.80] Whoever wants to come
[4573.80 → 4574.96] And be my disciple
[4574.96 → 4576.56] What does it say next?
[4577.52 → 4579.04] Must deny themselves
[4579.04 → 4581.58] Take up their cross
[4581.58 → 4583.14] And follow me
[4583.14 → 4586.08] And it's not easy
[4586.08 → 4587.60] To deny ourselves
[4587.60 → 4589.56] And it's certainly not easy
[4589.56 → 4590.70] To take up our cross
[4590.70 → 4592.14] But Jesus says
[4592.14 → 4593.02] That's the invitation
[4593.02 → 4594.42] And there are times
[4594.42 → 4595.70] When witness is easy
[4595.70 → 4596.32] In the sense of
[4596.32 → 4597.22] You feel like you're being
[4597.22 → 4598.62] Propelled by the spirit
[4598.62 → 4599.72] And there's a reception
[4599.72 → 4600.80] From the person with you
[4600.80 → 4601.36] Or your community
[4601.36 → 4602.16] That you're sharing with
[4602.16 → 4603.08] And there are times
[4603.08 → 4603.60] Where it's met with
[4603.60 → 4605.40] Resistance and hostility
[4605.40 → 4606.80] And we must be faithful
[4606.80 → 4607.96] In whatever circumstance
[4607.96 → 4609.12] God places us in
[4609.12 → 4610.74] To witness to Jesus
[4610.74 → 4611.54] In our words
[4611.54 → 4612.84] Our deeds
[4612.84 → 4614.24] And our shared life
[4614.24 → 4615.78] To do it publicly
[4615.78 → 4617.10] And to be willing
[4617.10 → 4617.70] To suffer
[4617.70 → 4619.38] If that is required
[4619.38 → 4621.52] And it's at this point
[4621.52 → 4622.36] I'm looking at the people
[4622.36 → 4623.38] Who were just on the stage
[4623.38 → 4624.68] Joining as members
[4624.68 → 4625.38] And you're thinking to yourself
[4625.38 → 4626.74] Is there an exit clause
[4626.74 → 4627.82] To this membership thing?
[4628.10 → 4628.42] Like I don't know
[4628.42 → 4629.06] If I signed up
[4629.06 → 4629.76] For all these things
[4629.76 → 4630.54] That Pastor David's
[4630.54 → 4631.22] Talking about
[4631.22 → 4632.60] And that makes me
[4632.60 → 4633.06] Want to loop
[4633.06 → 4633.70] To what I think
[4633.70 → 4634.48] Is the good news
[4634.48 → 4635.32] Of this passage
[4635.32 → 4638.06] Before Jesus says
[4638.06 → 4639.64] What our identity
[4639.64 → 4640.36] Is as witnesses
[4640.36 → 4641.04] What does he say
[4641.04 → 4641.60] Before that?
[4641.80 → 4642.54] Let me read it for us
[4642.54 → 4643.04] Verse 8
[4643.04 → 4647.76] You will receive power
[4647.76 → 4649.50] When the Holy Spirit
[4649.50 → 4650.30] Comes on you
[4650.30 → 4651.40] And you will be
[4651.40 → 4652.04] My witnesses
[4652.04 → 4654.90] Do you believe that church?
[4654.90 → 4657.76] That Jesus Christ
[4657.76 → 4659.04] Gives us
[4659.04 → 4661.18] Everything we need
[4661.18 → 4662.62] In every culture
[4662.62 → 4663.74] In every time
[4663.74 → 4665.12] To make Jesus known
[4665.12 → 4667.28] Jesus knows
[4667.28 → 4668.14] Just how weak
[4668.14 → 4669.32] And frail we are
[4669.32 → 4670.30] How timid
[4670.30 → 4672.06] And scared we are
[4672.06 → 4672.62] To speak
[4672.62 → 4673.16] And live
[4673.16 → 4674.02] And share the faith
[4674.02 → 4675.10] He knows that
[4675.10 → 4676.16] He sees it
[4676.16 → 4676.86] In his own disciples
[4676.86 → 4677.58] So what does he do?
[4677.64 → 4677.98] He says
[4677.98 → 4679.66] You are sent as witnesses
[4679.66 → 4680.44] And guess what?
[4680.50 → 4681.28] I'm going to give you
[4681.28 → 4682.44] All the power
[4682.44 → 4683.94] And the strength you need
[4683.94 → 4684.90] Through the coming
[4684.90 → 4685.68] Of the Holy Spirit
[4685.68 → 4687.58] And let's just pause
[4687.58 → 4688.20] And give thanks
[4688.20 → 4689.44] That the same spirit
[4689.44 → 4690.54] That filled the disciples
[4690.54 → 4691.58] Who we read about
[4691.58 → 4692.28] In the book of Acts
[4692.28 → 4693.26] Is the spirit
[4693.26 → 4694.10] Who lives
[4694.10 → 4695.06] And moves
[4695.06 → 4696.38] Here at Hope Community Church
[4696.38 → 4698.08] Do you believe
[4698.08 → 4698.56] That he gives you
[4698.56 → 4700.50] Everything you need
[4700.50 → 4701.92] With your co-worker
[4701.92 → 4703.44] Your friend
[4703.44 → 4705.14] Your classmates
[4705.14 → 4706.50] Your difficult
[4706.50 → 4707.48] Living circumstance
[4707.48 → 4709.00] Everything you need
[4709.00 → 4710.08] To make Jesus known
[4710.08 → 4712.34] I can't remember
[4712.34 → 4712.88] If I shared this
[4712.88 → 4713.46] In the 9 a.m.
[4713.48 → 4714.56] Or already in this service
[4714.56 → 4715.76] My brain's getting tired
[4715.76 → 4717.26] But J.I. Packer
[4717.26 → 4717.92] Gives this image
[4717.92 → 4718.60] And I love this
[4718.60 → 4718.96] He says
[4718.96 → 4720.68] Think of the gospel
[4720.68 → 4722.60] Like this dark billboard
[4722.60 → 4724.68] And people do not know it
[4724.68 → 4725.62] Unless the spirit
[4725.62 → 4727.06] Illuminates that billboard
[4727.06 → 4727.98] And it says Jesus
[4727.98 → 4729.04] And the spirit
[4729.04 → 4730.00] Enables us
[4730.00 → 4730.88] With power
[4730.88 → 4732.42] To illuminate
[4732.42 → 4733.18] Jesus
[4733.18 → 4734.54] To our watching world
[4734.54 → 4736.40] That means
[4736.40 → 4736.90] He will give you
[4736.90 → 4737.56] Everything you need
[4737.56 → 4738.20] To speak
[4738.20 → 4740.18] And do not be surprised
[4740.18 → 4741.58] If you get those promptings
[4741.58 → 4742.46] I've heard this so often
[4742.46 → 4742.78] In our church
[4742.78 → 4743.28] That people are like
[4743.28 → 4744.22] I don't want to share
[4744.22 → 4744.78] About Jesus
[4744.78 → 4745.96] But I'm getting the pressure
[4745.96 → 4746.66] From the spirit
[4746.66 → 4748.12] To speak about Jesus
[4748.12 → 4749.46] Do not be surprised
[4749.46 → 4750.54] If you're put in circumstances
[4750.54 → 4751.46] Where your lifestyle
[4751.46 → 4752.66] Will be put on display
[4752.66 → 4753.46] By the spirit
[4753.46 → 4754.72] So that people can see
[4754.72 → 4756.42] The way that Christians live
[4756.42 → 4757.92] And don't be surprised
[4757.92 → 4759.92] Please do not be surprised
[4759.92 → 4761.50] If Jesus puts you
[4761.50 → 4761.92] In a place
[4761.92 → 4763.10] Where people ask questions
[4763.10 → 4764.62] And they want to follow him
[4764.62 → 4765.90] And you are so to speak
[4765.90 → 4766.76] Put up to bat
[4766.76 → 4767.96] And it's time
[4767.96 → 4768.68] To get in the game
[4768.68 → 4770.28] And make Jesus known
[4770.28 → 4773.30] I want to return
[4773.30 → 4773.94] To that image
[4773.94 → 4774.86] That Josiah shared
[4774.86 → 4775.52] Last week
[4775.52 → 4776.22] It's an image
[4776.22 → 4776.78] That I saw
[4776.78 → 4777.92] One of my children writing
[4777.92 → 4779.22] And it's also an image
[4779.22 → 4780.38] As Josiah shared it
[4780.38 → 4781.32] I felt resonance
[4781.32 → 4781.84] With the people
[4781.84 → 4782.48] Sitting around me
[4782.48 → 4783.38] And in my own heart
[4783.38 → 4783.86] And that is that
[4783.86 → 4784.46] The spirit
[4784.46 → 4785.46] Is like this
[4785.46 → 4786.28] Tidal wave
[4786.28 → 4787.14] Of power
[4787.14 → 4788.56] And the church
[4788.56 → 4789.82] Sits in this
[4789.82 → 4790.78] Huge wave
[4790.78 → 4791.22] Over us
[4791.22 → 4791.90] With these tiny
[4791.90 → 4792.82] Little cups
[4792.82 → 4794.22] And the invitation
[4794.22 → 4794.96] Of our scripture
[4794.96 → 4795.64] The invitation
[4795.64 → 4796.68] Of God himself
[4796.68 → 4798.28] Is to receive
[4798.28 → 4799.02] That power
[4799.02 → 4800.22] And to allow
[4800.22 → 4800.62] The spirit
[4800.62 → 4801.64] To lead us
[4801.64 → 4802.58] To bear witness
[4802.58 → 4803.94] To Jesus Christ
[4803.94 → 4807.24] What I want to do now
[4807.24 → 4808.14] Is lead us in prayer
[4808.14 → 4810.12] And I'm going to pray
[4810.12 → 4810.60] For the spirit
[4810.60 → 4811.22] To fill us
[4811.22 → 4812.16] I'm going to name
[4812.16 → 4813.20] Some specific fears
[4813.20 → 4814.52] And leave space
[4814.52 → 4815.38] For you to insert
[4815.38 → 4816.12] The blanks
[4816.12 → 4816.88] Insert the names
[4816.88 → 4817.68] Insert the fears
[4817.68 → 4818.76] And then we will ask
[4818.76 → 4819.16] The spirit
[4819.16 → 4820.12] To make us faithful
[4820.12 → 4821.06] And witness
[4821.06 → 4821.78] In our city
[4821.78 → 4822.96] So join me
[4822.96 → 4823.44] In prayer
[4823.44 → 4829.90] Father thank you
[4829.90 → 4831.20] That we get
[4831.20 → 4832.04] To be your church
[4832.04 → 4834.14] It is a privilege
[4834.14 → 4835.36] To have our sins
[4835.36 → 4836.08] Washed away
[4836.08 → 4837.84] To have our lives
[4837.84 → 4838.88] Be put back together
[4838.88 → 4840.68] And to experience
[4840.68 → 4841.60] Salvation because
[4841.60 → 4842.16] Of what Jesus
[4842.16 → 4842.92] Has finished
[4842.92 → 4843.72] We praise you
[4843.72 → 4846.16] It is a privilege
[4846.16 → 4847.32] To be a community
[4847.32 → 4848.38] That has the life
[4848.38 → 4849.14] Of the spirit
[4849.14 → 4851.34] It's a privilege
[4851.34 → 4852.40] To be your witnesses
[4852.40 → 4853.48] In our city
[4853.48 → 4856.14] And now we want
[4856.14 → 4856.92] To lay before you
[4856.92 → 4858.04] All of our fears
[4858.04 → 4860.40] Fears of sharing
[4860.40 → 4860.94] The gospel
[4860.94 → 4862.12] Or living the gospel
[4862.12 → 4862.94] Fears of what people
[4862.94 → 4863.96] Might think and say
[4863.96 → 4864.84] We bring these
[4864.84 → 4865.86] Before you now
[4865.86 → 4866.88] In prayer
[4866.88 → 4888.10] Lord we call to mind
[4888.10 → 4889.68] Now specific relationships
[4889.68 → 4892.14] Whether it's relationships
[4892.14 → 4892.48] With us
[4892.48 → 4893.26] Conflicts
[4893.26 → 4894.14] Or we have fear
[4894.14 → 4895.14] To share the gospel
[4895.14 → 4896.76] People that you've
[4896.76 → 4897.76] Already put on our heart
[4897.76 → 4898.86] We bring them before you
[4898.86 → 4899.68] And pray for them
[4899.68 → 4901.32] That we would be witnesses
[4901.32 → 4902.42] To those people
[4902.42 → 4923.98] And finally Lord
[4923.98 → 4925.58] We think of all the tasks
[4925.58 → 4926.82] That you call us to
[4926.82 → 4928.88] The place where we're
[4928.88 → 4929.96] Going to be tomorrow morning
[4929.96 → 4931.32] And throughout the week
[4931.32 → 4932.16] Whether it's at work
[4932.16 → 4932.78] Or at school
[4932.78 → 4934.28] With our neighbours
[4934.28 → 4936.84] We ask that you give us
[4936.84 → 4938.46] Opportunity to live
[4938.46 → 4940.06] Out the gospel
[4940.06 → 4941.98] So that people
[4941.98 → 4943.48] Would see our good deeds
[4943.48 → 4945.86] And glorify your name
[4945.86 → 4946.82] On the day you visit
[4946.82 → 4948.50] Because they watch
[4948.50 → 4949.70] The gospel in action
[4949.70 → 4957.48] Spirit of the living God
[4957.48 → 4961.00] Breathe life on us
[4961.00 → 4961.78] As your church
[4961.78 → 4965.16] Give us everything we need
[4965.16 → 4967.04] Strength
[4967.04 → 4968.14] Wisdom
[4968.14 → 4969.00] Courage
[4969.00 → 4969.74] Love
[4969.74 → 4970.88] And boldness
[4970.88 → 4973.36] And make us faithful witnesses
[4973.36 → 4974.72] We pray in Jesus name
[4974.72 → 4975.78] Amen
[4975.78 → 4979.60] I invite you to stand with me
[4979.60 → 4980.90] And sing our song of response
[4980.90 → 4982.16] Heal our land
[4982.16 → 4998.42] You take our lives
[4998.42 → 5001.30] Flawed yet beautiful
[5001.30 → 5006.26] Restore
[5006.26 → 5007.26] Restore
[5007.26 → 5010.26] Refine
[5010.26 → 5014.34] Lord you're merciful
[5014.34 → 5023.30] Redeemer
[5023.30 → 5024.30] Refine
[5024.30 → 5027.30] Spirit of God
[5027.30 → 5028.14] Spirit of God
[5028.14 → 5031.56] Breathe on your church
[5031.56 → 5034.62] Pour out your presence
[5034.62 → 5038.14] Speak through your word
[5038.14 → 5041.30] We pray in every nation
[5041.30 → 5044.30] Christ be known
[5044.30 → 5048.06] Our hope and salvation
[5048.06 → 5050.96] Christ alone
[5050.96 → 5055.30] New power
[5055.30 → 5058.30] New life
[5059.18 → 5063.30] As divisions fall
[5063.30 → 5068.30] One church
[5068.30 → 5069.72] One church
[5069.72 → 5072.92] One bride
[5072.92 → 5077.14] Jesus Lord of all
[5077.14 → 5083.18] With one voice
[5083.18 → 5085.10] We pray
[5085.10 → 5088.68] Spirit of God
[5088.68 → 5091.96] Breathe on your church
[5091.96 → 5094.84] Pour out your presence
[5094.84 → 5097.84] Speak through your word
[5097.84 → 5100.84] We pray in every nation
[5100.84 → 5103.84] Christ be known
[5103.84 → 5106.84] Our hope and salvation
[5106.84 → 5109.84] Christ alone
[5109.84 → 5111.84] Christ alone
[5111.84 → 5116.48] We pray in every nation
[5116.48 → 5146.46] guitar solo
[5146.48 → 5149.32] Lord, would you hear our cry?
[5149.80 → 5152.68] Lord, will you heal our land?
[5153.18 → 5155.92] That every eye will see
[5155.92 → 5159.12] That every heart will know
[5159.12 → 5162.44] The one who took our sin
[5162.44 → 5165.82] The one who died and rose
[5165.82 → 5168.86] So God, we pray to you
[5168.86 → 5172.10] Humble ourselves again
[5172.10 → 5175.28] Lord, would you hear our cry?
[5175.28 → 5178.62] Lord, will you heal our land?
[5179.12 → 5181.88] That every eye will see
[5181.88 → 5185.12] That every heart will know
[5185.12 → 5188.24] The one who took our sin
[5188.24 → 5192.28] The one who died and rose
[5192.28 → 5197.88] Spirit of God
[5197.88 → 5198.88] Spirit of God
[5198.88 → 5201.50] Breathe on your church
[5201.50 → 5204.68] Pour out your presence
[5204.68 → 5208.30] Speak through your word
[5208.30 → 5212.04] We pray in every nation
[5212.04 → 5214.88] Christ be known
[5214.88 → 5218.22] Our hope and salvation
[5218.22 → 5222.48] Christ the Lord
[5222.48 → 5228.90] Well, that is a fitting song
[5228.90 → 5229.98] To finish our service
[5229.98 → 5232.20] One thing to note
[5232.20 → 5233.88] Before we receive God's blessing
[5233.88 → 5234.44] And that is
[5234.44 → 5236.00] Take a moment to find the people
[5236.00 → 5237.04] Who joined our church
[5237.04 → 5238.20] Encourage them
[5238.20 → 5239.40] Introduce yourself to them
[5239.40 → 5240.26] Let them know that you're part
[5240.26 → 5241.40] Of that family with them
[5241.40 → 5243.68] Lastly, let me just emphasize
[5243.68 → 5245.36] That God breathes us in
[5245.36 → 5246.34] On Sunday morning
[5246.34 → 5248.42] Fills with us his life
[5248.42 → 5250.00] So that he can breathe us
[5250.00 → 5250.72] Into the city
[5250.72 → 5252.06] That we would make known
[5252.06 → 5252.90] Jesus Christ
[5252.90 → 5253.74] Our risen Lord
[5253.74 → 5255.24] So receive his blessing
[5255.24 → 5256.60] The Lord bless you
[5256.60 → 5257.88] And keep you
[5257.88 → 5259.34] The Lord make his face
[5259.34 → 5260.62] Shine upon you
[5260.62 → 5262.26] And be gracious to you
[5262.26 → 5264.56] May the Lord turn his face
[5264.56 → 5265.16] Towards you
[5265.16 → 5267.06] And give you his peace
[5267.06 → 5268.06] And together we say
[5268.06 → 5268.84] Amen
[5268.84 → 5270.12] Go in peace
[5270.12 → 5271.36] Enjoy fellowship together
[5271.36 → 5273.26] We're just going to sing you out
[5273.26 → 5274.46] Feel free to go out
[5274.46 → 5274.86] And visit
[5274.86 → 5275.52] We're just going to sing
[5275.52 → 5276.32] The blessing over you
[5276.32 → 5276.96] As you depart
[5276.96 → 5281.56] Lord bless you
[5281.56 → 5285.06] And keep you
[5285.06 → 5287.40] Make his face
[5287.40 → 5289.30] Shine upon you
[5289.30 → 5292.24] Be gracious to you
[5292.24 → 5296.60] Lord turn his face
[5296.60 → 5298.10] Toward you
[5298.10 → 5302.60] And give you peace
[5302.60 → 5308.38] Amen
[5308.38 → 5311.60] Amen
[5311.60 → 5313.60] Amen
[5313.60 → 5315.60] Amen
[5315.60 → 5321.60] Amen
[5321.60 → 5323.60] Amen
[5323.60 → 5324.60] Amen
[5324.60 → 5325.60] Amen
[5325.60 → 5328.60] Amen
[5328.60 → 5329.60] Amen
[5329.60 → 5330.60] Amen
[5330.60 → 5331.60] Amen
[5331.60 → 5334.60] The Lord bless you
[5334.60 → 5337.60] And keep you
[5337.60 → 5341.60] Make his face shine upon you
[5341.60 → 5344.60] And be gracious to you
[5344.60 → 5349.60] The Lord turn his faces for you
[5349.60 → 5349.62] This Jesus means to you
[5349.62 → 5351.06] I will be honest tonight
[5351.06 → 5378.10] I will be новые
[5378.10 → 5380.98] Amen.
