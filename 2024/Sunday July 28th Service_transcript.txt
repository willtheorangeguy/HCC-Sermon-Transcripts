[0.00 --> 8.10]  well thank you for that prayer val that last line is very much in keeping with our sermon series
[8.10 --> 14.40]  that we can know who jesus is through the pages of scripture and in this sermon series if you've
[14.40 --> 18.72]  been tracking with us throughout the summer we're doing a whole sermon series on the hard sayings of
[18.72 --> 24.62]  jesus recognizing that there are many things jesus says that compute and they minister to us and they
[24.62 --> 29.84]  encourage us and there are other things jesus says that actually can trouble us and even confuse
[29.84 --> 36.18]  us or frustrate us and we want to especially listen even then recognizing that there is good news and
[36.18 --> 42.56]  there's a reason why jesus gives this teaching both then and now today we're looking at teaching that
[42.56 --> 48.04]  kind of represents a cluster of teaching on discipleship specifically the challenges of
[48.04 --> 53.14]  discipleship and i invite you if you have your bible turn with me to luke chapter 9 we're going to read
[53.14 --> 55.54]  verse 57 over to 62
[55.54 --> 64.58]  this is uh the heading of this section of scriptures called the cost of following jesus
[64.58 --> 71.92]  as they were walking along the road man said to him i will follow you wherever you go
[71.92 --> 79.82]  jesus replied foxes have holes and birds have nests but the son of man has no place to rest his head
[79.82 --> 86.62]  he said to another man follow me but he replied lord first let me go and bury my father
[86.62 --> 93.68]  jesus said to him let the dead bury their own dead but you go and proclaim the kingdom of god
[93.68 --> 100.14]  still another said i will follow you lord but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family
[100.14 --> 107.88]  jesus replied no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom
[107.88 --> 110.42]  of god this is god's word
[110.42 --> 119.10]  one of the things that can get under my skin and i have a feeling it gets under your skin too
[119.10 --> 126.98]  is false advertising and it's everywhere right billboard ads social media on the television you
[126.98 --> 133.06]  can't avoid false advertising let me give you just a few examples you will never order a burger at a
[133.06 --> 139.06]  fast food joint that looks even remotely close to the burger you see on that commercial tell me i'm wrong
[140.18 --> 148.34]  you will never apply skin cream to your face that will take 15 to 20 years off of your age even though
[148.34 --> 155.30]  you saw that so convincingly on instagram and you will never buy a new version of your phone that will
[155.30 --> 160.98]  give you even close to the joy they show whoever's on the commercial holding that new phone and the
[160.98 --> 165.38]  reality is a new phone will come out again that makes that old phone look terrible that's the world
[165.38 --> 172.10]  we live in and in each of these cases these advertisers these companies are tricking you into thinking
[172.10 --> 176.90]  you're going to get more than they actually can deliver and you always get let down right that's how
[176.90 --> 181.70]  it always goes whatever new item you buy you're always going to be let down by the false advertisement
[181.70 --> 191.70]  you know who never does this jesus this guy gives no false pretenses about discipleship and what
[191.70 --> 196.82]  it means to be his follower if you're here last week and mike goheen is preaching on luke or sorry
[196.82 --> 202.26]  in john chapter 6 on following him it finishes jesus teaching with a whole bunch of disciples abandoning
[202.26 --> 207.70]  and deserting jesus and then in this passage i mean think about this there's people who travel with jesus
[207.70 --> 212.42]  they express interest in being his disciple and what does he do he's like wait do you know what
[212.42 --> 217.30]  you're getting up for do you know what you're trying to sign up for with this discipleship thing
[217.30 --> 222.98]  you better count the cost he doesn't want anyone having false pretenses he doesn't want to have any
[222.98 --> 228.82]  gimmicks he want people to know exactly what they're signing up for lest they hastily join into a movement
[228.82 --> 237.94]  that they actually do not want luke chapter 9 is an invitation to wholehearted devotion to jesus to
[237.94 --> 245.46]  having loyalty to him above all other things and allow him if he sees fit to lead us into places that
[245.46 --> 251.70]  are difficult challenging that involve insecurity independence and even suffering because that is
[251.70 --> 259.14]  following our suffering servant one writer describes this passage as jesus giving the demands of
[259.14 --> 265.62]  discipleship and if there's ever a writer that i've read anyway who has talked a lot and written
[265.62 --> 270.50]  extensively on the demands of discipleship his name is dietrich bonhoeffer if you're here two years ago i
[270.50 --> 275.38]  quoted him so endlessly that people told me to stop they get it but dietrich bonhoeffer wrote a book called
[275.38 --> 281.30]  the cost of discipleship which i commend to you and one of the short punchy quotes in this book is this he
[281.30 --> 290.18]  writes salvation is free but discipleship will cost your life and that really does get at what jesus
[290.18 --> 295.38]  is teaching in luke chapter 9. now before we enter into our passage i just want to give two pieces of
[295.38 --> 300.66]  context that are going to help us understand what's going on in the gospel of luke as a whole the first
[300.66 --> 307.22]  eight nine chapters are jesus going around revealing his power showing the life of the kingdom demonstrating
[307.22 --> 311.70]  his miracles all the rest just revealing his identity revealing his purpose revealing the life of the
[311.70 --> 318.50]  kingdom chapter 9 shows up and we see this decisive turn in verse 51 this is what we read as the time
[318.50 --> 326.10]  approached for him to be taken up to heaven jesus resolutely set out for jerusalem now what happens in
[326.10 --> 334.18]  jerusalem that's where jesus is crucified right jesus is walking from luke chapter 9 all the way till the
[334.18 --> 338.98]  end of the book he's walking to the place where he knows he's going to be executed he's going to
[338.98 --> 343.06]  suffer he's going to be mocked betrayed or those who say they're his followers are going to abandon him
[343.06 --> 348.90]  and then he's going to die on the cross and it's almost as if the shadow of suffering looms over all
[348.90 --> 355.14]  the teaching from luke 9 up until the crucifixion and the resurrection jesus gives a lot of teaching
[355.14 --> 360.90]  on discipleship and he wants his disciples to know as he teaches along the way towards jerusalem what they're
[360.90 --> 367.62]  getting into and it's almost as though right off the hop luke wants to know it's not easy because
[367.62 --> 372.74]  the next verse describes jesus saying we're going to go to samaria and they send disciples ahead to
[372.74 --> 376.74]  samaria saying hey we're going to come to the city we need hospitality will people open their homes and
[376.74 --> 382.26]  provide food for us and those disciples come back to jesus and what do they say you're not welcome here
[382.26 --> 387.54]  jesus your message is not welcome here you are not welcome here and then jesus and his disciples have
[387.54 --> 393.86]  to receive the rejection of samaria and as luke's way of saying that's discipleship that's what
[393.86 --> 401.14]  disciples are getting themselves into as they follow jesus now our passage is one that i think is worth
[401.14 --> 410.26]  imagining imagine jesus walking on a dusty road from one town to another and this would have taken a long
[410.26 --> 416.26]  time his disciples would have walked with him lots of time for open conversation questions a lot of
[416.26 --> 420.18]  people from one town to another would join them that's how it worked they would just travel together
[420.18 --> 424.90]  there's safety there many of them would follow with jesus just because they're intrigued by him
[424.90 --> 430.10]  they heard teachings of his they want to see what he's like and that's what's going on in our passage
[430.90 --> 434.90]  people have come alongside the disciples they're listening in they're having conversation and they
[434.90 --> 442.50]  engage jesus in conversation and luke records three of these conversations each of them show i think a
[442.50 --> 446.98]  considerable interest in following jesus they're intrigued by him they want to follow him and in
[446.98 --> 454.58]  each case jesus gives them a very clear instruction about the demands of discipleship now the first
[454.58 --> 459.70]  conversation there's three conversations the first one i think is about the difficulty and the rejection
[459.70 --> 464.58]  of discipleship the second and third they kind of lump together and they are about delaying
[464.58 --> 470.42]  discipleship and as we're going to see in a minute in both cases people say to jesus but first can i first
[470.42 --> 477.70]  let me i need to attend to this thing first then i'll follow you so let's dive into it verse 57
[478.50 --> 483.86]  as they're walking along the road a man said to him i will follow you wherever you go
[485.06 --> 491.78]  jesus replies foxes have dens and birds have nests but the son of man has no place to rest his head
[493.78 --> 498.26]  now when i read this passage the first thing that stands out to me is the incredible statement this
[498.26 --> 505.54]  traveler makes to jesus when's the last time you or i said to jesus in prayer lord i will follow you
[505.54 --> 511.70]  wherever you go i mean that's a massive statement of commitment a massive statement of trust a big
[511.70 --> 518.74]  sense of like allegiance to jesus and what's jesus response i'm homeless will you follow me still
[520.02 --> 524.50]  more specifically the point of this passage is not that jesus doesn't have his own house although
[524.50 --> 530.90]  that's true the point of this passage is that jesus is not welcome in homes right in samaria he sends
[530.90 --> 535.14]  word this is how he does his ministry he sends word into communities asks for people to open up their
[535.14 --> 540.90]  homes so he could eat where he can stay sleep in safety and what we just saw is that people come
[540.90 --> 546.98]  back to jesus and his disciples saying no you're actually not welcome here your message what you're
[546.98 --> 552.50]  teaching what you're on about your rebellion that you're forming against rome this isn't welcome to us
[552.50 --> 558.02]  and jesus looks at his disciples his travelers and he says are you willing to walk with me into
[558.02 --> 566.10]  rejection are you willing to follow a master who leads you into unwelcome and that rejection i think
[566.10 --> 570.02]  takes many shapes it could be economic rejection where you lose work because of your faith it could
[570.02 --> 574.82]  be social relational rejection where people do not associate with you because of your faith or they
[574.82 --> 579.54]  they don't welcome you around their table because of what you believe but that rejection is real and
[579.54 --> 586.18]  jesus says count the cost following me involves rejection it is not safe it puts you in vulnerable
[586.18 --> 592.98]  places and it is not easy and comfortable last year over my sabbatical i was reading a book on
[592.98 --> 598.26]  discipleship and uh the writer was saying how many people in the west and i i can't speak for other
[598.26 --> 602.26]  countries but i'm almost convinced that this is very true in the west and maybe we have this in our own
[602.26 --> 608.18]  hearts so check yourself as you hear this there's this unspoken agreement we have with god or with jesus as
[608.18 --> 613.86]  we disciple under him and the agreement is this like lord i want to follow you i want to give time
[613.86 --> 618.26]  to you want to serve your serve your kingdom with my gifts i want to go to church on sundays and worship
[618.26 --> 626.34]  and give so long as you take care of me as you make life go smoothly for me as you give comfort and
[626.34 --> 632.58]  wealth to my life and if i become unhealthy and sick and if i have economic instability or if things are
[632.58 --> 638.18]  difficult for me relationally well you've broken your end of the contract god and if we're listening
[638.18 --> 645.62]  well to jesus in luke 9 he's saying very clearly to us i do not promise wealth i do not promise
[645.62 --> 652.58]  safety i do not promise comfort and by the way those are three massive idols massive idols in the
[652.58 --> 657.78]  west and in our own hearts if we're honest and jesus says do not think i've come to give you wealth
[657.78 --> 662.18]  comfort and security i've come so that you would follow me and find life in me and that will very
[662.18 --> 670.82]  likely put you at odds with a world that does not believe in me count the cost now it should be noted
[670.82 --> 676.18]  that we don't needlessly look out suffering or look for suffering and rejection it's not as though we need
[676.18 --> 680.58]  to be a sect of christians that are just looking to make life as difficult for ourselves as possible
[680.58 --> 685.62]  god does take care of us god does provide for us but he doesn't promise us these things and when
[685.62 --> 691.06]  things get difficult we don't say well what are you doing lord why are you rejecting me no we're
[691.06 --> 696.34]  following our suffering servant we're following a master who leads us down the path of rejection
[697.38 --> 703.38]  count the cost now we get to the second and the third conversations and these are really
[703.38 --> 707.78]  surrounding the same point where disciples say to jesus i want to follow you but first this i have this
[707.78 --> 714.58]  delay and so let's read these together we read he said to another man follow me
[714.58 --> 721.62]  but he replied lord let me first go and bury my father jesus said to him let the dead bury their own
[721.62 --> 727.78]  dead but you go and proclaim the kingdom of god still another said i will follow you lord but first
[727.78 --> 733.70]  let me go back and say goodbye to my family jesus replied no one who puts a hand to the plow and looks
[733.70 --> 740.42]  back is fit for service in the kingdom of god now i'm just going to admit to you i have never studied
[740.42 --> 747.06]  this passage in depth before and at face value this feels pretty harsh doesn't it the 9 a.m service i
[747.06 --> 753.38]  just looked at people like wow that that's really strong language why would jesus say that and i'll just
[753.38 --> 759.62]  be even more honest with you both of those things that the travelers say to jesus feel very legitimate
[759.62 --> 766.26]  don't they first let me go back and take care of my father who just passed away first let me go back and
[766.26 --> 773.22]  say goodbye to my family why would jesus speak so harshly here i mean this is a fair question after
[773.22 --> 779.86]  the 9 a.m service i was talking with a few people for a while just like man jesus is very sharp on this
[779.86 --> 785.70]  point right and i'll even be more honest there's a few different interpretations of this passage uh maybe
[785.70 --> 791.06]  more than i even read one interpretation especially of the dead burying their own dead one was maybe jesus
[791.06 --> 796.18]  is speaking spiritually let the the spiritually dead who do not know about jesus let them bury their own
[796.18 --> 801.86]  dead and you then go and proclaim and share and speak about jesus christ the lord of life right
[801.86 --> 807.14]  evangelize another take and i didn't know this is that the burial process in the first century was a
[807.14 --> 812.42]  long one first you would bury your parents and they'd be in a sort of a tomb in the in the side of a rock
[812.42 --> 817.22]  face and then a year later you go and collect the bones and then you collect those bones in a bone box
[817.22 --> 822.34]  and it took a long time and so maybe one writer was suggesting this delay is actually quite a long
[822.34 --> 827.22]  delay and this person you know they're not going to sign up for it after such a long period of waiting
[827.22 --> 834.02]  to follow jesus i'm not particularly convinced of either of those interpretations because i think
[834.02 --> 839.94]  what jesus is doing and we see this in other parts of luke and matthew is he's speaking very strong
[840.58 --> 846.98]  very hyperbolic language to make his point as strongly as possible and the point is this
[846.98 --> 854.10]  that loyalty to jesus and the kingdom of god must supersede and transcend all other loyalties
[854.82 --> 861.54]  all other commitments all other things that you are interested in including family did you notice how
[861.54 --> 868.50]  the excuse in both cases are related to family and most commentators actually link this teaching
[868.50 --> 874.98]  in luke chapter 9 to another teaching of discipleship on the road in luke chapter 14 and i had one dad
[874.98 --> 879.78]  who asked me to preach on this specific passage and instead i'm lumping it into this sermon so
[879.78 --> 884.42]  this is luke chapter 14 and just listen to the strength of these words it doesn't get any stronger
[884.42 --> 892.18]  than this large crowds were traveling with jesus and turning to them he said if anyone comes to me and does
[892.18 --> 898.18]  not hate father and mother wife and children brothers and sisters yes even their own
[898.18 --> 904.42]  life such a person cannot be my disciple and whoever does not carry their cross and follow me
[904.42 --> 910.90]  cannot be my disciple and one person i was reading this week about this passage he said i don't think
[910.90 --> 916.02]  jesus could ever have a mega church he just drives everybody away like this is a strong statement
[916.74 --> 920.26]  and let me ask you does jesus want us to hate our moms and dads
[921.86 --> 926.66]  no in fact that goes against the old testament law the ten commandments to honor our mother and father
[926.66 --> 933.54]  does jesus want us to hate our brothers and sisters and our own lives no this is hyperbolic language
[933.54 --> 939.94]  because what does jesus want he wants our loyalty to him to be above all those other relationships
[939.94 --> 945.62]  and our commitment to his direction on our lives to be prioritized above all those other relationships
[945.62 --> 952.50]  including the most intimate of family relationships and it's at this point i need to name and sometimes
[952.50 --> 957.06]  this is not the case in the west right now but in the first century and in many parts of the world
[957.06 --> 966.50]  even now family is everything right you do not disagree with mom and dad you do not deviate from
[966.50 --> 971.38]  what they say is going to be the case you don't disagree with what they teach about how you should live
[971.38 --> 977.54]  and there are many cases in the first century and throughout church history where people hear the call
[977.54 --> 987.22]  of jesus to follow him and they know they know it means going against mom and dad brother and sister
[987.22 --> 994.58]  and other family members and they have to count the cost and say it's either i go with what mom and dad
[994.58 --> 1002.66]  say or siblings say or the family unit says or i follow the call of jesus christ and he is truly the top
[1002.66 --> 1010.42]  he has all the authority his word is the final word many christians in the first century and beyond
[1010.42 --> 1016.34]  had to give up a great deal of family respect christians would be disinherited unwelcome from the
[1016.34 --> 1022.74]  table pushed out of the family system because they have chosen to make jesus christ the lord of their lives
[1023.94 --> 1028.42]  that's counting the cost and i'll just bring this closer to home i am aware
[1028.42 --> 1035.78]  that for a number of people even our own church their journey of becoming a christian had a deep
[1035.78 --> 1042.98]  wrestling with family right i know of a few parents who say to their kids there's no way you can believe
[1042.98 --> 1049.62]  that garbage that pastors like me preach on sundays there's no way you can buy into the crazy teachings
[1049.62 --> 1056.02]  of this old ancient book and parents who say like okay you can believe it but don't you dare bring that
[1056.02 --> 1060.82]  teaching into the home don't you speak about it around the table and i'm aware as well that even
[1060.82 --> 1066.90]  for those of us who follow jesus right now we have to be careful around family because our allegiance to
[1066.90 --> 1072.10]  jesus puts us at odds if our family believes something completely different and has their
[1072.10 --> 1078.90]  faith and everyone has faith in something other than jesus we have to count the cost and what jesus is
[1078.90 --> 1087.14]  saying in both luke 9 and luke 14 is our allegiance to him must be above even our closest family members
[1088.10 --> 1093.46]  and i know we love our families there is some amazing families in our church i've met a bunch of
[1093.46 --> 1100.10]  them but jesus christ is above those and if there's ever a difference between what christ says by his word
[1100.10 --> 1105.78]  to us and what our family teaches us we must make that hard choice of saying christ is lord
[1105.78 --> 1112.18]  above my family above my friends above other commitments that's what jesus is teaching in luke
[1112.18 --> 1120.10]  chapter 9 in summary jesus is saying in these three conversations if you want to follow me count the
[1120.10 --> 1125.94]  cost following me often is the path of rejection of being unwelcome it's economically vulnerable and
[1125.94 --> 1130.10]  insecure is that what you want it's not going to be wealth it's not going to be safety it's not going
[1130.10 --> 1136.50]  to be comfort and secondly are you willing to allow allegiance to me to transcend and be above
[1136.50 --> 1142.10]  family friends and all other loyalties that's discipleship
[1144.74 --> 1150.34]  now it's at this point i want to just pause and acknowledge with you that these are very hard words
[1151.62 --> 1157.62]  two times this week i found myself working on the sermon just kind of processing these words and i need
[1157.62 --> 1162.58]  to go on a walk with god and i need to talk through some of my own compromise some of the ways where
[1162.58 --> 1169.06]  i felt my allegiance is so divided and i realize that this word just penetrates our hearts and it makes
[1169.06 --> 1178.82]  us ask hard questions i think jesus wants us to feel the tension he wants us to ask the hard questions is
[1178.82 --> 1185.38]  this what we signed up for and if you're here visiting and you're exploring the christian faith
[1185.38 --> 1187.86]  i just want to say this is what jesus invites you to
[1191.14 --> 1196.90]  last november i had a chance to listen to a lecture by a pastor who is actually a campus pastor
[1196.90 --> 1202.18]  at a university in phoenix and he spent most of his time sharing the gospel with students who did not
[1202.18 --> 1206.90]  know jesus and i got to listen to how he did it which was really encouraging i got to listen to like
[1206.90 --> 1211.54]  what he's learned about evangelism how not to do it but he shared one thing that he does that was
[1211.54 --> 1215.94]  very intriguing to me many of the students he'd have conversation with and just kind of
[1216.50 --> 1221.14]  listen to and hear the stories he would ask him he said would you be willing to draw on a sheet of
[1221.14 --> 1226.66]  paper how you understand the christian faith and of course some said no and others said absolutely
[1226.66 --> 1231.22]  and a few times he got an art major who gave him like a piece of art that described the way they see
[1231.22 --> 1236.42]  the christian faith but one student in particular drew the christian faith in this way i don't have it
[1236.42 --> 1242.42]  with me but i'll just imagine this it's a person pushing a shopping cart and inside the shopping
[1242.42 --> 1246.34]  cart in a supermarket inside the shopping cart there's all these things like there's a nike swoosh
[1246.34 --> 1250.82]  there's sports equipment there's food and all these things kind of represent the various dimensions of
[1250.82 --> 1256.98]  our lives right family friends work school and then the person was grabbing a cross and sort of putting
[1256.98 --> 1263.46]  the cross in the shopping cart to represent christianity and knowingly or unknowingly i think this
[1263.46 --> 1269.62]  student gave a brilliant summary of how so many of us see the christian faith it's sort of one more
[1269.62 --> 1276.02]  little religious thing to add to our shopping cart and i mean how how fitting is it and appropriate to
[1276.02 --> 1282.42]  our culture that the image they even had of our life is the shopping cart a consumer society and you're
[1282.42 --> 1288.58]  just adding a little bit of jesus into that full cart of all the things you have and if i were to bring
[1288.58 --> 1295.62]  jesus from luke chapter 9 into the image of the shopping cart that this student drew what i picture
[1295.62 --> 1302.66]  is jesus coming to the shopping cart and flipping it up entirely on its end and saying to all of us
[1302.66 --> 1310.18]  i'm the resurrection in the life i'm the first and i am the last i am the lord over the universe i am
[1310.18 --> 1318.10]  the firstborn among the dead all of your life commitments must be organized around me because in me
[1319.14 --> 1328.18]  is life jesus is not just one more consumer good to put in our full lives he's not just one more
[1328.18 --> 1335.86]  religious addition to add to our already busy and full lives he's the center stake the person who makes
[1335.86 --> 1343.30]  meaning of all history around which we organize everything else and discipleship is the organization
[1343.30 --> 1350.58]  of your whole life around jesus christ it is taking your financial life and saying lord not my will but
[1350.58 --> 1356.26]  your be done and taking your friendship life your leisure life your married life your sexual life
[1356.26 --> 1363.46]  all the dimensions of our existence and saying lord we hold it before you your will be done in every
[1363.46 --> 1373.06]  corner of my life of our lives together over the last couple years i've come to enjoy the writings
[1373.06 --> 1378.58]  of dallas willard and maybe you know who he is he's one of the earliest writers that i can remember who
[1378.58 --> 1384.50]  is describing how in north america we don't just have a discipleship problem we have a discipleship crisis
[1384.50 --> 1389.86]  and the way he would name it is if discipleship is being with jesus it's becoming like jesus and it's
[1389.86 --> 1394.58]  doing what jesus did together as the church well we have a whole lot of churches that aren't interested
[1394.58 --> 1400.82]  in being with jesus or becoming like jesus or doing what jesus did that's a discipleship crisis
[1400.82 --> 1404.34]  and i want to read for you words that have challenged me over the years these come this
[1404.34 --> 1412.66]  comes from a book called the great omission and this is what he writes the greatest issue facing the
[1412.66 --> 1418.50]  world today with all its heartbreaking needs that's a big claim he's making here is whether those who by
[1418.50 --> 1428.58]  profession or culture are identified as christians will become disciples students apprentices practitioners
[1428.58 --> 1435.14]  of jesus christ steadily learning from him how to live the life of the kingdom of heaven into every
[1435.78 --> 1442.82]  corner of human existence do you get what he's saying there and he's speaking to an american audience
[1442.82 --> 1445.78]  and i think this is also true of canada where it's like if you grew up in the church in some way but
[1445.78 --> 1449.86]  left it you still you see yourself as christian you went to mass with your grandma as a kid you
[1449.86 --> 1455.06]  see yourself as christian and he's saying what matters is whether you are a disciple of jesus or
[1455.06 --> 1460.10]  not and he highlights how in the new testament specifically the gospels there's two categories
[1460.10 --> 1465.54]  of people in relationship to jesus you know what they are there's the crowd and there are disciples
[1467.22 --> 1471.54]  and everyone has to decide what's my relationship to jesus and am i with the crowd that can easily walk
[1471.54 --> 1476.26]  away when he says something that we disagree with or my disciple who's committed to his way because
[1476.26 --> 1478.18]  he is lord and he is savior
[1482.34 --> 1486.74]  now i remind us again that this is a heavy passage i feel it i think you feel it too
[1487.78 --> 1491.38]  and maybe if you're new to church i know we have a number of people in our church who are just
[1491.38 --> 1496.98]  stepping into the christian faith trying to explore it maybe you're thinking wow why would anyone become
[1496.98 --> 1504.10]  a christian like this is very demanding why would people preach on these words in luke's gospel
[1505.22 --> 1510.02]  and let me just put it simply and then i'll tease it out a little bit the reason jesus asks us to count
[1510.02 --> 1521.06]  the cost is because he knows it's worth it discipleship is worth the price that we have to give up it's worth
[1521.06 --> 1527.78]  the cost of giving up all things or to reverse you know think of jesus language what good is it to gain
[1527.78 --> 1532.90]  the whole world and forfeit your soul and jesus saying if you forsake all those other loyalties
[1532.90 --> 1540.10]  and allow jesus to be the center you gain life and what jesus is going to do when he gets to jerusalem
[1540.10 --> 1546.10]  when he gets crucified he is going to once and for all for all who would believe for the sake of his
[1546.10 --> 1554.26]  world defeat the power of sin he's going to defeat the tempter who runs wreck in our life and he's going to
[1554.26 --> 1561.22]  defeat death itself and bring resurrection you'll notice that even in our passage the language we see
[1561.22 --> 1566.18]  is the kingdom of god jesus is coming to bring the rule of god the life of god and the power of god
[1566.18 --> 1571.86]  into our reality such that we when we come to jesus in faith we come to the source of life
[1571.86 --> 1579.30]  life so for jesus counting the cost is an obvious answer it's worth the cost
[1581.38 --> 1586.66]  and i'll add to that something that dallas willard has given me language for that it's meaning more and
[1586.66 --> 1590.18]  more as i get older and dallas willard says not only do we have to count the cost of discipleship
[1591.22 --> 1597.14]  but we have to count the cost of non-discipleship that is to say if jesus is not the center something
[1597.14 --> 1601.38]  else will be the center and i would say this generally speaking if you're a western person you grew up
[1601.38 --> 1606.98]  in canada the center is you and you know what happens when you're the center you have to live
[1606.98 --> 1615.46]  with you or to put it more strongly with biblical language you then are trapped under the power of
[1615.46 --> 1620.90]  the flesh and that's not a great place to be is it i don't think i need to explain what that feels
[1620.90 --> 1625.14]  like we all know what it's like to be trapped in our sin to make these decisions and possibly that
[1625.14 --> 1630.18]  we're not proud of to go all to these vices in our life all these idols that we just find ourselves
[1630.18 --> 1635.06]  worshiping and we try to squeeze out of those idols meaning and satisfaction and happiness and
[1635.06 --> 1640.42]  they never give us what we want right if you're here last week pastor mike was sharing how we just
[1640.42 --> 1646.18]  try to find so desperately satisfaction in the wealth in the comfort in the popularity in the
[1646.18 --> 1653.54]  grades whatever it is and it never delivers because it can't and jesus says count that cost
[1653.54 --> 1660.18]  the cost of being trapped under the power of sin and then recognize that the one who's calling us to
[1660.18 --> 1668.74]  a costly obedience a costly discipleship is the one who transforms our lives into the likeness of jesus
[1669.94 --> 1677.70]  the one who takes our brokenness and our sin brings grace and mercy and makes us like jesus that to come
[1677.70 --> 1685.06]  into contact with jesus is to come into contact with the source of life and church it's worth the cost
[1688.58 --> 1693.62]  one of the passages that has been ringing in my head all week and i'm trying to pay more attention to
[1693.62 --> 1699.06]  the passages that pop into my head as i prepare sermons but it comes from matthew 11 where jesus makes
[1699.06 --> 1706.02]  an invitation to discipleship and he talks about it as a yoke and the image if you grew up in a modern city
[1706.02 --> 1710.34]  you won't know what yoke is but it's what animals wore like as they did the farming work they would
[1710.34 --> 1716.10]  pull the plow and there's this wooden yoke on them and it's got weight to it it's heavy and jesus describes
[1716.10 --> 1721.06]  following him as a yoke but now i want to read for you how he describes it in matthew 11. this is going
[1721.06 --> 1730.82]  to bring us to the end of the sermon it says come to me all you who are weary and burdened and i'll give
[1730.82 --> 1736.50]  you rest and as a pastor living in north america i want to say come to me all you who are weary from
[1736.50 --> 1743.54]  trying to rule your own life burdened by trying to squeeze out of life satisfaction that only jesus
[1743.54 --> 1753.22]  christ can give and he will give us rest he will give us shalom take my yoke upon you and learn from me
[1753.22 --> 1764.42]  for i'm gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden
[1765.30 --> 1765.94]  is light
[1768.82 --> 1770.02]  let me lead us in prayer
[1770.02 --> 1782.18]  father i pray that you give us ears to hear the words of your son jesus
[1783.86 --> 1789.62]  i pray that we would be able to respond in faith and obedience by the power of your spirit
[1792.42 --> 1796.50]  and i join the confessions that have already been prayed this morning by asking that you forgive
[1796.50 --> 1804.10]  our half-hearted loyalty our lukewarm faith the unspoken agreement we have with you that says it
[1804.10 --> 1810.74]  has to be easy or we're walking away we ask that you forgive us for worshiping all the wrong idols of
[1810.74 --> 1820.26]  safety of social approval of greed and of comfort and i ask lord on behalf of all of us that your son jesus
[1820.26 --> 1829.46]  christ would reign in us that his rule and his life would be our priority and that you by your gracious
[1829.46 --> 1837.94]  time and by your power and your spirit would enable us week by week day by day to give our allegiance to
[1837.94 --> 1843.14]  jesus the source of life we pray this in his name amen
[1843.14 --> 1858.82]  at this time i invite you to stand and sing with me a song of response and that is a song called rain in us
[1858.82 --> 1860.82]  you
